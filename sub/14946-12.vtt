How?

how about a few

06:42.611 --> 06:44.147

06:44.446 --> 06:45.947
Well, I would never
wear that thing.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.439
Came with more warnings than

06:48.534 --> 06:49.569

07:03.257 --> 07:05.669

07:37.041 --> 07:38.952
to putting things right
in this timeline.

But the Alec that's out there
has pressed fast-forward.

The greatest challenge
we face in this work

the perks at Piron

than policing.

change around you.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.636
Liber8 blown apart?

17:05.775 --> 17:07.356
What chance is there
for any real change

17:07.444 --> 17:10.936
when anyone can
go back and tweak
events in their favor?

17:12.407 --> 17:13.692
Everyone believes
in a do-over.

17:13.783 --> 17:16.320
You just press reset
and start again.

17:17.621 --> 17:19.407
But it'll
never last.

17:20.332 --> 17:22.323
There's a place up north.

17:22.417 --> 17:25.454
Remote, people minding
their own business.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.632
Do you really
think that's us?

17:31.218 --> 17:32.503
Only one way to find out.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.877
We'll always be hunted.

17:43.104 --> 17:44.560
I'm afraid.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.521
We can drive north.

17:47.943 --> 17:49.808
Figure it out together.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.697
I'll meet you
at Lana Lou's.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.066
We'll talk tonight.

18:06.336 --> 18:09.169
Everything we've seen
in the past two years
is the new face of warfare.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.378
The Internet attacks,
bio-weapons.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.998
People in power using

18:13.093 --> 18:15.550
the rich versus poor divide
to push their own agendas.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.840
You call that warfare?

18:18.598 --> 18:19.974
Don't you?
No.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.929
The haves versus
have-nots isn't news.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.520
It is when 85 people
in the world

18:24.604 --> 18:25.889
are richer than
three billion.

18:26.481 --> 18:27.596
You're the one
cozying up to the 85.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.764
Using them?
Yes.
Mmm-hmm.

18:29.859 --> 18:30.848
What?

18:31.236 --> 18:33.648
Police have always
solicited the support

18:33.738 --> 18:35.069
of the rich and powerful.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.605
Yeah well, I hate
to break it to
you, Inspector,

18:36.700 --> 18:39.442
but we work for the city
and all of its citizens.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.359
Come on, Carlos.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.907
Kissing some corporate
ass is what it takes

18:43.999 --> 18:45.205
to keep this city safe.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.623
Oh, and the HALO
smart bracelet,

18:46.710 --> 18:47.916
you think that's
perfectly safe?

18:49.004 --> 18:50.369
It's collecting
information.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.964
Information that
you want to use

18:52.048 --> 18:54.164
to track down
criminals before
they commit crimes.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.290
I need help.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.386
I need better
surveillance.

18:58.013 --> 19:00.049
Some of the shit that's
gone down in this city...

19:00.932 --> 19:02.012
What weapons have I got?

19:02.559 --> 19:03.799
Whatever.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.224
Yeah, whatever.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.052

busting my balls
on this, aren't you?

19:11.985 --> 19:13.225
Good.

19:27.709 --> 19:29.370
Let me just drop
this off to Alec,

19:29.461 --> 19:31.201
then we can go take
a look at the lab.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.545
I'm gonna show you
some of this new
crowd control technology.

19:34.632 --> 19:37.214
It's the safest
thing I've ever seen.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.675
All right.

19:53.568 --> 19:54.728
You're the welcoming
committee?

19:58.448 --> 19:59.938
What the hell?
I told you.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.903
I want Alec Sadler.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.526
They're here.
All is secure.

21:43.595 --> 21:44.880
I'll catch up with you.

21:45.346 --> 21:46.335
That's not the plan.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.890
I know, we both have
things we need to do.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.384
Rescuing Alec is what
this time needs.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.387
Maybe. But
I believe in Plan B's.

we're married.

How do you like it?

22:06.659 --> 22:07.694
Oh.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.620
Had to change my
lifting routine

22:09.704 --> 22:10.693
when it found a heart murmur.

22:10.788 --> 22:12.289
So, hate it, but

22:12.957 --> 22:15.118
love it, you know?
Oh, I hearthat.

22:15.585 --> 22:16.950
Whatever you're
doing, it's working.

22:19.297 --> 22:21.162
Say, do you

22:21.633 --> 22:23.669
maybe want
to grab a coffee?

22:24.719 --> 22:26.505
I can be downstairs
in like five minutes.

22:26.596 --> 22:27.585

That's the one!

23:02.340 --> 23:03.455
I was wrong.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.005
But we have to move.

23:12.475 --> 23:13.681
Just get me out of here

23:14.352 --> 23:15.467
and then you
can go to hell.

23:27.657 --> 23:29.147
Are you coming in?

23:32.287 --> 23:33.322
No. I'm not.

I'll get a ride back
to the precinct.

24:01.149 --> 24:02.480

25:01.668 --> 25:03.033
Sonya, what's been
going on with you?

25:03.336 --> 25:04.451
I've told you that
you're important

25:04.545 --> 25:05.500
and that you'll
do great things,

25:05.588 --> 25:06.748
but you don't seem
to believe me.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.921
That's because most of
what you say is psychotic.

you decide to be.

I've seen it in you.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.076
I've seen it
in your writings.

25:39.455 --> 25:42.071
You are the revolutionary
that will resist Alec Sadler.

25:43.251 --> 25:44.707
By killing people?

25:45.128 --> 25:46.868
Maybe. Maybe not.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.208
There have been so many
changes in this timeline.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.057
She tried to sabotage
the HALO mainframe.

32:21.524 --> 32:22.684
I'm assuming
it didn't work.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.231
No, we were
on her too fast.

32:24.819 --> 32:25.774
You know I had her.

32:25.861 --> 32:26.896
She practically surrendered

32:26.987 --> 32:28.602
and Dillon was ready
to shoot her in the street.

32:30.032 --> 32:31.021
You heard?

32:31.200 --> 32:32.610
It's a coup.

32:33.202 --> 32:34.191
Join me.

32:43.254 --> 32:44.243
Big day.

32:45.714 --> 32:46.965
Feels that way.

32:47.049 --> 32:49.040
Can't win for losing,
as you pointed out.

32:50.719 --> 32:53.051
There's no rescue
mission this time,
Miss Valentine.

32:53.848 --> 32:55.008
You know that was
the end of us?

32:55.808 --> 32:57.673
A day that should have
felt like such a victory.

32:58.811 --> 33:00.221
You beat us.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.855
KIERA: You beat yourselves.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.229
Isuppose.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.765
There's an opportunity
for you here, you know.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.230
You tell us where
to find the others

33:09.321 --> 33:11.403
and you have my word it
will go easier for you.

33:13.075 --> 33:14.281
They're gone,
company man.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.951
And even if I did know
where to find them,

33:18.038 --> 33:20.654
do you honestly
believe I'd sell my own
people out so easily,

33:20.749 --> 33:22.705
just because
you did?

33:26.255 --> 33:27.244
You can go.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.886
Fight or flight,
Protector.

33:32.970 --> 33:34.255
They're both bad choices.

33:34.805 --> 33:36.011
You don't believe that.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.090
I believed an idea was
greater than love.

33:40.769 --> 33:41.975
DILLON: Cameron.

33:42.062 --> 33:43.393
SONYA: Don't wait
till it's too late.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.100
You'll figure it out.

33:57.328 --> 33:58.784
Are you prepared for this?

34:00.998 --> 34:02.158
Yeah, yeah.

34:05.461 --> 34:07.247
Dillon is very
powerful, Carlos.

34:07.338 --> 34:08.578
This could come
back on you.

34:08.756 --> 34:10.041
Yeah, well, let it.

34:10.257 --> 34:12.043
Can't watch what he's
doing and let it pass.

34:13.302 --> 34:14.883
We've been known
to outsource
the incarceration

34:14.970 --> 34:16.961
of terrorists, you know?

34:17.598 --> 34:19.384
We just don't have
the facilities here.

34:20.976 --> 34:24.389
CSIS, FBI, Canadian
and US military.

34:24.480 --> 34:26.641
It seems like everybody
wants a piece of you.

34:28.317 --> 34:30.603
Right now you're all mine.

34:30.945 --> 34:33.027
I imagine that must be
quite a thrill for you.

34:33.113 --> 34:34.102
What can I say?

34:34.281 --> 34:35.737
I like to accomplish my goals.

34:36.533 --> 34:38.489
Catch the big
bad terrorist?
Check.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.659
Stop her would-be
sabotage. Check.

34:45.334 --> 34:47.325
Help me find
the others.

34:48.212 --> 34:50.328
You can be more comfortable
than you deserve.

34:50.881 --> 34:52.872
You're still selling that
line when there's no one left

34:52.967 --> 34:53.956
in the room but me?

34:57.221 --> 34:58.336
How about you?

34:59.181 --> 35:00.341
I found the other Alec.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.131
And it wasn't exactly
a friendly reunion.

35:03.477 --> 35:05.308
Maybe I'll get my own chance
to make things right.

35:10.484 --> 35:12.600
What did you think you
were going to accomplish

35:12.695 --> 35:14.731
with this sabotage?
People will wake up.

35:14.822 --> 35:16.904
People like their gadgets!

35:17.241 --> 35:19.607
Your entire rebellion
is pointless.

35:19.702 --> 35:22.034
Not if it inspires someone
to resist what you're doing.

35:22.246 --> 35:23.235
What I am doing

35:23.330 --> 35:25.161
is making the world
a safer place.

35:25.374 --> 35:26.363
What's to resist?

35:26.458 --> 35:29.074
You're like every general
that's ever tasted power.

35:30.004 --> 35:31.494
You want more.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.379
And you will
destroy what
is human

35:34.466 --> 35:35.922
in us to get it.

35:37.886 --> 35:40.548
I'm afraid in this case
you overestimate me.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.381
No, I think I see
you very clearly.

35:43.726 --> 35:45.432
You're low-hanging fruit
and Alec Sadler

35:45.519 --> 35:48.886
has plucked you off
the vine to chew you up
and spit you out.

35:51.859 --> 35:53.520
How long till you
spoil completely?

35:55.779 --> 35:57.644
That's no
prison transfer detail.

35:58.449 --> 36:00.189
You're in no
position to judge.

36:01.285 --> 36:02.570
I'm in the best position.

36:10.210 --> 36:11.586
Ifind you guilty.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.427
(GRUNTS) Are you okay?

36:22.514 --> 36:24.129
(ALARM BEEPING)

36:30.856 --> 36:32.938
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

36:34.693 --> 36:36.684
(SIRENS WAILING)

36:41.283 --> 36:43.148
What a goddamn mess.

36:46.330 --> 36:47.786
What do we do about Nora?

36:48.582 --> 36:51.574
Have her bury this?
Let the guy go out with
some sort of dignity?

36:52.544 --> 36:53.795
I don't know.

36:56.382 --> 36:57.497
I've got to go.

36:57.591 --> 37:00.424
I have to find Alec,
figure outwhich...

37:00.552 --> 37:01.541
Kiera...

37:06.100 --> 37:08.307
It was still
in his briefcase.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.161
He had a backup plan

38:50.537 --> 38:52.152
if the first rendezvous
didn't work out.

38:52.581 --> 38:54.071
Kids playing like a
couple of professionals.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.494
Whereas the
two professionals...

38:57.211 --> 38:58.997
Well, we made it this far.

39:02.799 --> 39:04.175
Why did you kill me?

39:13.894 --> 39:15.600
It wasn't personal.
(SCOFFS)

39:18.273 --> 39:19.683
My mission was to kill him.

39:22.611 --> 39:24.272
And you walked in.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.941
Collateral damage.

39:27.908 --> 39:30.445
Chen told me who
you are. What you were.

39:31.954 --> 39:33.740
Guess I thought I was
killing an enemy soldier.

39:37.125 --> 39:38.626
ls Alec safe?

39:40.212 --> 39:41.827
He's your family.

39:42.965 --> 39:44.250
He's my family.

39:44.424 --> 39:46.551
Not the family I was
trying to get back to.

39:47.469 --> 39:48.754
I know.

39:52.808 --> 39:54.469
The strange thing?

39:56.228 --> 39:58.014
Aside from all of it,

40:00.816 --> 40:02.306
is that if you
hadn't shot me

40:02.401 --> 40:04.437
Inever
would have found you.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.106
Kiera Cameron.

40:12.369 --> 40:13.984
You are the key.

40:57.581 --> 40:59.321
He's so forgiving.

41:00.292 --> 41:01.281
He loves you.

41:02.794 --> 41:03.783
EMILY: Good luck.

41:03.879 --> 41:05.540
Enjoy this place.

41:05.714 --> 41:08.330
You too. Wherever
it is that you're going.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.211
I don't want to know.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.350
I don't believe anything that
I do will make a difference

41:24.441 --> 41:25.430
in the way that you want.

41:26.026 --> 41:27.357
Not in the way
I once wanted.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.730
I understand, I get it.

41:30.113 --> 41:31.978
But what about for now
when it's needed?

41:32.324 --> 41:33.689
Sometimes people
make assumptions

41:33.784 --> 41:35.775
on their basic hypotheses
that are wrong.

41:36.495 --> 41:37.530
You thought that
I was the problem.

41:37.621 --> 41:39.031
I thought that
I was the problem.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.779
But...
But itwas me.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.661
Problem. Solution. Who knows?

41:48.090 --> 41:49.751
Be careful, Alec.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.249
You too.

42:19.496 --> 42:22.863
Viewers tipped a million
last night, Mr. Sadler.

42:22.958 --> 42:24.619
You picked up your
tilt-rotor yet?

42:25.293 --> 42:27.124
Youhear
aboutSonya?
Dead.

42:27.295 --> 42:28.501
I heard.

42:28.588 --> 42:30.544
Down a board
member, too.

42:33.343 --> 42:34.719
Too soon. Sorry.

42:35.721 --> 42:38.007
You were fond
of him, I know.

42:38.473 --> 42:40.384
Now, would you like
to see this picture?

42:41.643 --> 42:44.180
I went old school with
this, for the privacy.

42:47.065 --> 42:48.805
That was yesterday.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.353
Seems the woman has
changed her mind.

42:57.284 --> 42:58.865
She is a heartbreaker.
