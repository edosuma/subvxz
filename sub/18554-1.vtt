01:47.107 --> 01:48.583
You still smoke?

01:48.650 --> 01:51.127
No, I'm getting old.

01:54.323 --> 01:55.464
Here.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.466
You want your bag?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.975
You bought a car?

02:06.168 --> 02:07.977
No, I borrowed it.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.857
- What's that?
- Nothing.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.700
It's too cold.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.744
Yes.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.070
- What's wrong?
- My wrist hurts.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.171
Let me.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.591
You're getting old, too.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.679
- Look, do I have enough room?
- You do.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.935
Stop!

02:49.294 --> 02:50.811
What are you doing?

02:52.714 --> 02:57.568
The past

03:01.306 --> 03:03.532
Do the girls know I'm here?

03:03.600 --> 03:04.742
No.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.410
Didn't you tell them?

03:06.520 --> 03:10.373
I thought you might let us down
at the last minute, again.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.384
Put it in fourth.

03:29.585 --> 03:32.103
I'm here now, let them know.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.188
I'd like to see them.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.315
We're going to see them now.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.650
Where?

03:38.010 --> 03:40.428
We're picking up Lucie
and going home.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.905
- Didn't you book a hotel for me?
- No.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.615
You were supposed to.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.602
I wasn't sure you'd come.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.103
What do you mean?

03:49.104 --> 03:50.579
I wasn't sure.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.086
Something came up last time.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.631
- Just two days before...
- Don't worry about it.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.950
We don't have all day
for your excuses.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.428
Just because I
canceled my trip once?

04:07.831 --> 04:09.432
Not just for that.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.192
The girls would like to have you.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.530
I don't want to disturb.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.907
You won't disturb us.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.729
You have to come for
your suitcase anyway

04:31.730 --> 04:33.706
when it's delivered.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.960
Come change your wet clothes.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.576
I drove around the block
to avoid a ticket.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.036
So?

05:54.104 --> 05:55.704
She left.

05:56.732 --> 05:59.208
Did she know you were coming?

05:59.985 --> 06:01.085
Let's go.

06:15.792 --> 06:19.186
Since you were late, maybe
she went home alone?

06:20.922 --> 06:22.064
It's not the first time.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.608
She came home at 11:00 last night.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.153
They all go through this.
It's normal.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.904
No, it's not normal.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.991
What's her problem?

06:33.101 --> 06:35.953
She's been giving me
hell for two months.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.919
Can you talk to her?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.049
See what's wrong with her?

06:49.326 --> 06:51.343
If she still remembers me.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.932
She loves you.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.684
Even now?

07:09.554 --> 07:11.530
Where are you going? Turn right!

07:12.849 --> 07:14.200
I was daydreaming.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.310
You've forgotten everything.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.537
I was distracted.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.891
Marie-Anne...

07:39.918 --> 07:42.519
You shouldn't leave
this here, it's risky.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.599
Is Lucie home?

08:20.709 --> 08:21.850
No.

08:43.106 --> 08:46.083
Fouad, you broke it.

08:46.610 --> 08:47.751
Pull harder...

08:47.777 --> 08:49.712
I can't, I'll hurt my hand.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.630
No, not like that.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.633
First put one side
on, then the other.

08:56.745 --> 08:57.970
I'll show you.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.972
So this

09:00.874 --> 09:03.642
goes here.

09:04.711 --> 09:05.894
There we go.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.230
It's dried out.

09:09.007 --> 09:12.151
We need some oil.
You know where to find some?

09:12.302 --> 09:15.571
It used to be in the
cupboard in the shed.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.573
Ahmad...

09:17.891 --> 09:19.033
Yes.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.309
My dear Léa.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.577
Doing good?

09:22.187 --> 09:24.163
You've grown so much, sweetie.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.751
Hello, sir.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.881
Your friend's ignoring me.
What's his name?

09:35.992 --> 09:38.010
His name is Fouad.

09:38.328 --> 09:39.762
Hello, Fouad.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.472
How are you?

10:19.703 --> 10:20.803
Come inside, Ahmad.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.496
And you, Fouad,

10:22.497 --> 10:24.807
come get your things
in the bedroom.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.813
It wasn't in the shed.

10:31.506 --> 10:34.483
You changed its place
while I was away.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.570
There's some in my father's car.

10:40.932 --> 10:43.242
Where's the shelf that was here?

10:43.310 --> 10:45.828
- That old wooden shelf?
- We moved it.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.037
Really?

10:47.105 --> 10:49.415
There were books of mine on it.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.292
All your stuff's put
away in the shed.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.378
Fouad, take your things upstairs.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.754
I don't like it upstairs.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.548
- What?
- I don't like it upstairs.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.842
Please, do what I said.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.513
Watch the paint.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.353
Wasn't the other color better?

11:11.421 --> 11:14.982
It's not done yet.
My wrist made me stop.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.143
I could've done it while I'm here.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.203
It would've kept me busy.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.374
Didn't you want to go to a hotel?

11:35.820 --> 11:37.337
I'll do it.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.937
- Ouch! That hurts.
- Sorry.

11:54.506 --> 11:55.798
It's fine, thanks.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.149
It's okay?

12:07.769 --> 12:10.204
- Here are the keys.
- Thanks.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.831
I left some clothes upstairs.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.209
Go change before you catch a cold.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.720
What are you doing here?

12:30.083 --> 12:31.391
Go on.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.187
You sleep upstairs and Lucie here.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.569
Lucie, call me back, please.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.197
I have a surprise for you.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.664
It's just while Ahmad's here.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.000
Hurry up, please.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.483
What a pain...

13:51.372 --> 13:53.890
Is that your father's car outside?

13:54.709 --> 13:55.851
Yes.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.022
- You live here?
- Yes.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.026
With your father?

14:04.093 --> 14:05.319
Yes.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.615
Since when?

14:13.978 --> 14:15.370
Since school started.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.210
Don't bother making your bed.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.671
You can go sleep downstairs.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.050
What a pain.

14:32.664 --> 14:35.390
First it's upstairs,
then it's downstairs.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.769
- What?
- It's upstairs, then downstairs.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.193
I'm sorry.

14:51.349 --> 14:54.743
- Why are you coming down?
- He told me to.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.205
Ask him, with his old furry beard.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.712
They can't all sleep downstairs.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.969
You live with someone?

15:15.623 --> 15:16.723
Yes.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.273
You didn't tell me.

15:25.550 --> 15:28.276
What do you mean?
I wrote it in my e-mail.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.569
What e-mail?

15:29.679 --> 15:33.073
I don't know which one.
One of them.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.741
I didn't get any.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.204
So why did you want
to stay at a hotel?

15:39.272 --> 15:41.248
Not to disturb you.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.292
In any case, I wrote you.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.794
I didn't get anything.

15:57.206 --> 16:01.143
You didn't wonder why I asked
you to come for the divorce?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.234
Does he know I'm here?

16:10.678 --> 16:11.820
Yes.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.540
I'm leaving, then.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.877
He won't come by while you're here.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.379
Or he'll let me know, for sure.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.344
When did you send that e-mail?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.347
I don't know.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.267
It must still be in your inbox.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.811
I guess so.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.147
Want me to show it to you?

16:48.925 --> 16:51.401
I asked you to book a hotel for me.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.528
I did last time and
you didn't come.

16:53.846 --> 16:54.930
I had to cancel.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.365
How much did it cost you?

16:59.435 --> 17:02.496
What time do I have to
be in court tomorrow?

17:03.731 --> 17:06.333
You said you'd stay
to talk to Lucie.

17:07.318 --> 17:09.002
When will she be home?

17:09.529 --> 17:10.862
I don't know.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.423
I can meet up with her tomorrow.

17:18.287 --> 17:21.388
I was hoping you'd keep
your promise for once.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.087
- I didn't promise anything.
- My mistake.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.521
Sorry.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.909
Fouad, can't you watch
where you walk?

17:41.894 --> 17:43.787
Why do I spend hours cleaning?

17:44.272 --> 17:45.831
For you to make a mess?

17:45.982 --> 17:48.375
Fouad, look at me when
I'm talking to you!

17:48.901 --> 17:50.318
Look at me!

17:50.319 --> 17:52.921
- We went for this.
- I don't give a damn!

17:52.989 --> 17:57.884
Get back here!

17:58.995 --> 18:00.220
Fouad, come here!

18:00.329 --> 18:01.972
I wanna go home!

18:02.331 --> 18:03.932
- Let me go!
- That's enough!

18:05.251 --> 18:06.768
Come here!

18:08.421 --> 18:10.088
- Let me go!
- Calm down.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.648
I wanna go home!

18:11.716 --> 18:12.858
You're a pain.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.823
Stop it!

18:20.808 --> 18:22.784
Let me go!

18:23.686 --> 18:25.912
- Look what you've done!
- I don't care!

18:26.022 --> 18:27.581
Stop it!

18:29.192 --> 18:31.693
Come on, Fouad, stop it!

18:31.694 --> 18:34.379
Let me go! I wanna go home!

18:34.489 --> 18:35.739
- Please, stop it!
- No!

18:35.740 --> 18:36.823
I'm sorry.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.341
- I'm sorry.
- I don't care.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.302
Let me go!

18:40.369 --> 18:42.554
- Please, Fouad.
- You're not my mom.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.015
Get out of here.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.976
That's enough!

18:48.044 --> 18:49.644
Enough, Fouad!

18:49.712 --> 18:51.980
- Leave me alone!
- Stop it!

18:52.381 --> 18:53.648
You're impossible!

18:59.722 --> 19:00.989
Open!

19:04.185 --> 19:05.994
I wanna go home!

19:08.523 --> 19:10.899
- Go, you're late.
- I'll clean this.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.484
- I'll do it.
- No, I'm okay.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.736
Not with your wrist, go.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.838
- I'm doing it.
- Go!

19:19.116 --> 19:21.176
I thought you were leaving.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.930
I'm waiting for Lucie.
We'll see after.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.807
Go on.

19:31.379 --> 19:33.980
Léa, can you go get
my shoes, please?

19:34.048 --> 19:35.857
Open the door!

19:35.925 --> 19:37.359
Hurry up.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.825
Open up!

19:46.519 --> 19:48.286
I'll escape anyway!

19:55.903 --> 19:57.545
Open the door!

20:03.953 --> 20:07.055
- You'll keep an eye on them?
- Don't worry.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.186
Thanks.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.688
Open!

20:17.592 --> 20:19.401
I'll break the door down!

20:19.510 --> 20:21.069
And run away!

20:21.721 --> 20:22.946
Open!

20:30.313 --> 20:31.913
Fouad, stop it.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.041
Back up, I'll open the door.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.630
What's the matter?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.096
Where are you going?

20:50.917 --> 20:52.100
- Wait.
- Let me go.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.309
- Stop!
- Let go!

20:53.419 --> 20:54.728
I'll let you go.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.022
- Let me go!
- I'll let you go.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.607
But first, tell me
where you want to go.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.651
Calm down.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.446
What are you doing?

21:04.513 --> 21:06.990
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving!

21:07.058 --> 21:08.324
Where to?

21:08.392 --> 21:09.659
My house!

21:09.727 --> 21:11.453
Where's your house?

21:11.646 --> 21:13.355
Paris. He can't, it's too far.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.540
Shut up! No one asked you!

21:15.650 --> 21:18.460
None of that in this house! Got it?

21:22.073 --> 21:23.715
Go, Léa. We need to talk.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.642
What's wrong, Fouad?

21:43.678 --> 21:46.321
- What is it?
- I want to go.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.450
You want to call home?

21:55.731 --> 21:57.832
There's no one in my home.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.763
What's the matter with here?

22:13.833 --> 22:16.059
Is it because she told you off?

22:20.339 --> 22:22.482
But you were misbehaving.

22:23.718 --> 22:25.485
You spilt the paint.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.529
You caused trouble.

22:31.726 --> 22:33.785
Didn't you spill the paint?

22:34.061 --> 22:36.329
It's not the paint.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.540
What is it, then?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.212
Is it because I'm here?

22:46.115 --> 22:48.007
You want me to leave?

23:08.971 --> 23:10.113
Hello, ma'am.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.369
How's it going?

23:18.731 --> 23:19.831
Fine.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.791
The plane was late.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.254
- He's here, then?
- Yes.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.057
Here.

23:39.001 --> 23:40.310
Where did you park it?

23:40.377 --> 23:41.644
Right there.

23:41.712 --> 23:43.605
- Where?
- There.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.775
You shouldn't leave this
in the car, it's risky.

23:49.845 --> 23:52.155
- Did you go to the hospital?
- Yes.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.116
- How was she?
- Same as usual.

24:02.191 --> 24:03.333
Fouad's not with you?

24:04.026 --> 24:06.878
- Why?
- He asked me to go pick him up.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.672
He didn't want to stay there.

24:11.242 --> 24:13.201
I got upset with him.

24:13.202 --> 24:14.636
With both of them.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.436
I'll take him home with me tonight.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.355
No reason to make a fuss.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.983
- He's never called me like that.
- I've never yelled like that.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.693
Anyway, I promised.

24:32.221 --> 24:35.448
Okay, I shouldn't have.
We'll make up tonight.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.806
If you come tonight, call me first.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.978
Corn, hot corn!

25:47.922 --> 25:48.963
What?

25:48.964 --> 25:50.106
Hot corn!

25:52.218 --> 25:53.818
Fouad, stop it!

25:55.971 --> 25:57.322
Here.

25:57.765 --> 26:00.158
Give him this. Careful.

26:05.439 --> 26:06.581
Here.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.959
- I don't want any.
- You cut your hand!

26:10.027 --> 26:11.336
No, I didn't.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.504
Yes, you did. You're bleeding!

26:13.572 --> 26:15.923
Ahmad! He cut his finger!

26:24.124 --> 26:25.808
Is that better?

26:33.842 --> 26:35.193
Lucie!

26:55.698 --> 26:57.006
Ahmad?

27:02.079 --> 27:04.514
How did you know it was me?

27:04.957 --> 27:08.059
- I knew you were coming today.
- My little Lucie...

27:08.836 --> 27:10.311
Lucie, want seconds?

27:10.379 --> 27:11.813
No, thanks.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.215
Come on, have some.

27:14.216 --> 27:17.318
You won't get real Ghormeh
Sabzi again soon.

27:17.553 --> 27:20.822
Unless you marry two
nice Iranian guys.

27:21.682 --> 27:24.659
And you, Fouad, an Iranian girl.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.745
How's that sound?

27:32.067 --> 27:33.835
- More?
- Thanks.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.005
What are Iranian girls like?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.007
Iranian girls.

27:42.244 --> 27:43.928
They look like me...

27:44.121 --> 27:45.680
But they're girls.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.182
Like this!

27:50.919 --> 27:53.688
- You like that?
- They do this all the time?

27:54.256 --> 27:56.023
- And they have a beard?
- No!

27:58.093 --> 28:00.403
You want to go to Iran with Ahmad?

28:01.472 --> 28:03.114
What's it like?

28:04.308 --> 28:06.075
You always come home so late?

28:06.477 --> 28:08.828
- Just to sleep.
- Really?

28:09.438 --> 28:12.039
I have nowhere else
to spend the night.

28:12.107 --> 28:14.167
Why don't you want to sleep here?

28:16.320 --> 28:17.795
Same as you.

28:19.573 --> 28:22.008
You'd rather go to your
friend's tomorrow.

28:22.076 --> 28:23.885
This isn't my home.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.930
And your friend's place is?

28:29.333 --> 28:30.933
I'm not comfortable here.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.520
Me neither.

28:35.172 --> 28:37.148
It's not the same.

28:37.716 --> 28:42.236
For me, it's hard to face the guy
who's about to marry my ex.

28:42.805 --> 28:44.197
It's normal.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.992
- Now she's just your ex?
- Well, yes.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.498
- Whatever.
- What?

28:53.982 --> 28:56.918
You lived here with her for years
and now she's just your ex?

28:57.027 --> 28:58.794
Everything's changed since then.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.005
We got separated.

29:01.156 --> 29:02.840
Give me a hand.

29:09.331 --> 29:11.599
You're old enough
to understand that.

29:11.667 --> 29:14.602
I'm old enough not
to be preached at.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.395
I'm not here to preach.

29:20.342 --> 29:23.945
Your mother asked me to
see what's got into you.

29:24.638 --> 29:27.348
I don't know why she
thinks you'd tell me.

29:27.349 --> 29:29.033
She knows what's got into me.

29:30.853 --> 29:33.871
I don't want to see that
jerk when I come home.

29:39.236 --> 29:40.503
Lucie!

29:44.741 --> 29:46.509
Come here, please.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.607
Isn't he a good guy?

30:05.429 --> 30:07.363
I don't know him.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.657
Why call him a jerk, then?

30:10.434 --> 30:11.659
What's he done?

30:13.770 --> 30:15.162
Nothing.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.501
He has no business being here.

30:20.861 --> 30:23.254
Your mother wants to live with him.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.281
She can live with
whoever she wants.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.591
Whoever she wants?

30:27.743 --> 30:30.928
Even a guy with a kid
and a wife in a coma?

30:32.289 --> 30:33.848
Fouad's mom?

30:39.755 --> 30:43.357
And if she married somebody
else, would you mind?

30:44.218 --> 30:45.860
It'd be the same.

30:46.929 --> 30:49.280
So your problem isn't him.

30:51.350 --> 30:55.036
Since I was born, my mom's
changed guys three times.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.499
And it's always the same story.

31:03.862 --> 31:07.423
They come, stay for a few
years and then they leave.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.267
Would you talk to her?

31:18.961 --> 31:20.561
About what?

31:21.463 --> 31:22.897
Talk her out of it.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.252
You guys are still up?

31:45.571 --> 31:47.421
Go upstairs, Fouad. Time for bed.

31:47.489 --> 31:49.465
Two more minutes, please!

31:49.533 --> 31:50.675
Two minutes.

31:53.662 --> 31:54.762
Good evening.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.518
Good night.

32:01.795 --> 32:03.104
Lucie?

32:03.505 --> 32:05.606
Can you sleep downstairs tonight?

32:05.716 --> 32:07.525
Fouad will go up with Ahmad.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.680
I saved you some food

32:12.681 --> 32:14.073
if you haven't eaten.

32:15.475 --> 32:16.575
Wow.

32:16.643 --> 32:17.785
Thanks.

32:17.853 --> 32:19.912
You want me to heat it up?

32:19.980 --> 32:21.414
No, thanks.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.625
Where did you get all the herbs?

32:26.153 --> 32:28.212
I went shopping with the kids.

32:31.325 --> 32:33.217
You're still a great cook.

32:33.827 --> 32:35.636
The one thing I'm still great at.

32:40.876 --> 32:43.352
What time must we
be there tomorrow?

32:44.463 --> 32:45.688
9:00.

32:49.718 --> 32:52.653
You don't eat Ghormeh
Sabzi with a fork.

32:55.223 --> 32:56.490
Here.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.214
Did you talk to her?

33:12.282 --> 33:13.549
Yes.

33:15.577 --> 33:16.802
And?

33:17.162 --> 33:18.763
You can guess.

33:20.123 --> 33:23.809
She doesn't like you remarrying.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.984
She's scared you'll live
with him for a while,

33:32.052 --> 33:34.779
and then he'll leave.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.201
Tell her this one won't.

33:44.147 --> 33:47.541
I don't think I'm the right
person to convince her

33:47.943 --> 33:49.877
to be happy you're getting married.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.256
I'm not asking her to be happy.

33:56.118 --> 33:58.886
I just want to know
what she's after.

33:59.329 --> 34:00.888
Stopping this marriage.

34:04.126 --> 34:06.060
It made me laugh, too.

34:08.422 --> 34:10.563
Try to convince her

34:10.632 --> 34:12.775
before making your decision.

34:16.096 --> 34:17.737
My decision's made.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.425
- Fouad?
- Yes.

34:39.661 --> 34:42.429
If you're not comfy,
we can switch.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.014
I'm okay.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.757
I need to pee.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.942
Go, then. Go on.

35:45.519 --> 35:47.119
That's good.

35:55.403 --> 35:57.755
Did you talk to her doctor, too?

35:59.074 --> 36:00.966
No, just the nurse.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.513
What did she say?

36:06.540 --> 36:08.098
About what?

36:09.668 --> 36:12.311
The scratches on her stomach.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.023
They happened after
my last two visits.

36:19.886 --> 36:22.655
Maybe it has nothing
to do with the visits.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.199
Maybe it was involuntary.

36:25.267 --> 36:27.368
You'd like it to be involuntary?

36:35.110 --> 36:36.335
I'm sorry.

36:44.578 --> 36:46.220
Do you hear yourself?

36:46.621 --> 36:50.557
You can't say whatever you
want and then apologize.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.398
What are you doing here?

37:01.386 --> 37:03.696
It's dark, I can't go up.

37:04.431 --> 37:06.073
Why do you want to go up?

37:06.516 --> 37:10.869
I asked him to go upstairs with Ahmad.
The girls are together.

37:11.271 --> 37:14.123
Maybe he doesn't want to
sleep with a stranger.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.003
Get your things, we're leaving.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.672
I'm sleepy. I want to go to bed.

37:22.866 --> 37:26.135
- You asked me to come get you.
- I want to stay.

37:28.288 --> 37:30.264
You can sleep in my bed.

37:30.874 --> 37:32.182
Come on.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.737
Ahmad, leave it,
we're running late.

37:45.055 --> 37:46.613
The sink is clogged.

37:46.681 --> 37:49.241
It can wait. We have
to be there by 9:00.

37:49.309 --> 37:50.909
Hurry up, kids!

37:56.441 --> 37:57.666
Yuck!

38:12.374 --> 38:13.849
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:14.209 --> 38:15.809
Hey, kids.

38:16.378 --> 38:17.770
Morning.

38:19.255 --> 38:20.647
Samir...

38:21.007 --> 38:22.816
My hands are dirty, sorry.

38:24.886 --> 38:26.653
It's blocked again?

38:26.721 --> 38:28.614
It's unblocked.

38:29.557 --> 38:31.658
I'll just screw it back on.

38:44.114 --> 38:45.923
Can I have the tea, please?

38:53.999 --> 38:56.517
- We'll drop you off.
- No need.

38:59.254 --> 39:01.355
Ahmad, we're late.

39:01.423 --> 39:02.940
I'm done.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.234
Get moving, kids.

39:05.427 --> 39:06.985
Go get ready.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.197
It's leaking.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.157
There's always been a leak.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.285
I told you the joint
has to be changed.

39:17.439 --> 39:19.206
I'll take care of it.

39:21.067 --> 39:23.710
Leave it, I'll do it.

39:26.906 --> 39:28.215
Okay.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.058
Did you eat anything?

39:38.126 --> 39:39.685
Not yet.

39:43.798 --> 39:46.358
- Can I see you after?
- Don't you have class?

39:47.135 --> 39:48.402
Coming.

39:50.472 --> 39:52.072
I can skip.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.907
What time do you finish?

39:53.975 --> 39:55.159
1:00.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.120
Want me to drive?

40:15.288 --> 40:17.431
- Looking for something?
- No.

40:28.718 --> 40:30.110
Wait.

40:56.204 --> 40:59.056
- Isn't that the school Lucie went to?
- Yes.

41:04.003 --> 41:05.312
Let's go.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.272
Bye, kids.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.815
Bye, Ahmad.

41:09.217 --> 41:11.777
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, sweetheart.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.155
Bye, Mommy.

41:15.223 --> 41:16.657
Wait, let me see.

41:16.724 --> 41:18.825
Come on, Fouad.

41:20.186 --> 41:21.495
Okay, bye.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.500
How did you meet?

41:27.235 --> 41:28.835
At the pharmacy.

41:29.404 --> 41:32.297
He'd come in for his
wife's medicine.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.758
What was wrong with her?

41:35.410 --> 41:36.885
She was depressed.

41:39.372 --> 41:40.555
What?

41:42.250 --> 41:43.642
What's that supposed to mean?

41:44.711 --> 41:46.311
We call it a smile.

41:46.421 --> 41:49.590
We call it mocking.
What's funny about it?

41:49.591 --> 41:52.192
Miss our fights, darling?

41:52.260 --> 41:54.152
Is her depression funny to you?

41:54.262 --> 41:57.364
Be nice or I'll get out
and go back to Tehran.

41:57.432 --> 41:59.266
Aside from your hair...

41:59.267 --> 42:01.576
- No divorce.
...you haven't changed.

42:03.271 --> 42:04.855
Shall I get out?

42:04.856 --> 42:06.440
Stop joking, we're late.

42:06.441 --> 42:08.083
- Shall I?
- Stop it.

42:11.696 --> 42:14.006
Seriously, what did
you think of him?

42:16.576 --> 42:20.053
Tell me first how serious
all this is for you.

42:23.291 --> 42:25.976
Serious enough for
me to be pregnant.

42:37.138 --> 42:38.822
Is that a joke?

42:38.848 --> 42:40.198
No.

42:46.064 --> 42:49.249
The request applies only
to your personal situation

42:49.317 --> 42:53.587
since no children were
born from this marriage.

42:54.239 --> 42:58.992
Ms. Brisson renounces the
usage of her husband's name

42:58.993 --> 43:01.553
and shall be restored
to her maiden name.

43:01.621 --> 43:04.957
It is noted that Ms. Brisson
will keep her home,

43:04.958 --> 43:07.059
20, rue de Paris, in Sevran.

43:07.126 --> 43:11.380
The divorce will take effect
on October 19th, 2012,

43:11.381 --> 43:13.048
date of this hearing.

43:13.049 --> 43:14.358
Sorry.

43:21.474 --> 43:24.284
Would you please turn that off?

43:27.021 --> 43:30.082
Each party has recovered
their personal property.

43:30.149 --> 43:33.460
Remaining possessions
have been divided.

43:33.528 --> 43:36.630
The taxes have been paid
by the two parties.

43:36.698 --> 43:38.673
The cost of the divorce
will be shared.

43:38.741 --> 43:43.303
This document clearly defines the
consequences of the divorce,

43:43.371 --> 43:46.264
if both parties consent.

43:46.332 --> 43:49.935
Is your decision final, madam?

43:50.003 --> 43:51.311
Yes.

43:51.379 --> 43:55.565
And you, sir, is your
decision also final?

43:57.218 --> 43:58.343
Yes.

43:58.344 --> 44:00.862
Therefore, you are hereby divorced

44:01.055 --> 44:03.223
as specified by Art.
230 of the Civil Code.

44:03.224 --> 44:06.284
I ratify the appended document,

44:06.352 --> 44:09.079
which will be attached
to the judgment...

44:10.815 --> 44:12.666
Please turn it off.

44:13.026 --> 44:14.167
Sorry.

44:15.069 --> 44:16.670
Marie, it's me.

44:17.363 --> 44:20.632
They've brought the suitcase.
It's broken.

44:20.908 --> 44:23.677
I don't know if
something's missing,

44:24.495 --> 44:26.555
if I should accept it or not.

44:27.915 --> 44:29.474
Call me back.

44:30.168 --> 44:32.853
- Okay?
- What if something's missing?

44:32.920 --> 44:34.688
Doesn't he have insurance?

44:34.797 --> 44:36.148
Don't know.

44:36.716 --> 44:38.150
What do we do, then?

44:38.217 --> 44:41.820
Will you take it or should I
return it to the airport?

44:46.559 --> 44:48.577
Sign here, please.

44:49.604 --> 44:50.912
Right here.

44:53.608 --> 44:55.000
You okay?

44:55.068 --> 44:57.586
- Why?
- Nothing, your eyes.

44:57.612 --> 44:59.546
I'm allergic to the paint.

44:59.614 --> 45:01.465
Change jobs!

45:41.406 --> 45:44.424
Excuse me, sir. Where's
the bus stop to Tajrish?

45:48.287 --> 45:50.889
- How are you?
- What are you doing here?

45:50.957 --> 45:53.016
Long time no see!

45:53.126 --> 45:54.626
- When did you get here?
- Yesterday.

45:54.627 --> 45:55.919
Please excuse me.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.562
Without warning, as usual.

45:57.630 --> 45:59.147
Do you recognize her?

46:00.007 --> 46:01.341
She's grown up!

46:01.342 --> 46:02.442
You okay?

46:03.261 --> 46:04.344
Yeah.

46:04.345 --> 46:07.822
- Haven't had lunch?
- Why else would we bother to come here?

46:08.224 --> 46:09.616
What a pretty young lady.

46:09.684 --> 46:11.326
Remember when you were little,

46:11.394 --> 46:13.119
he'd bring you here on his bicycle?

46:13.187 --> 46:16.122
That was Léa, this is Lucie!

46:16.190 --> 46:17.707
Forgive me.

46:17.817 --> 46:20.043
You've always mixed them up.

46:20.528 --> 46:22.170
- Take a seat.
- Where's Valeria?

46:22.238 --> 46:23.797
I'll call her.

46:24.532 --> 46:25.949
Your friend's here.

46:25.950 --> 46:27.050
Who?

46:29.370 --> 46:30.637
Ahmad?

46:34.208 --> 46:35.976
Hi, Valeria, how are you?

46:36.043 --> 46:38.144
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

46:38.212 --> 46:39.646
I've missed you.

46:40.381 --> 46:42.065
Remember Lucie?

46:42.300 --> 46:43.717
Little Lucie!

46:43.718 --> 46:45.068
Not that little...

46:45.636 --> 46:47.362
You look beautiful.

46:47.430 --> 46:49.531
You two are still together?

46:49.724 --> 46:52.993
We have something in common
that keeps us together.

46:53.102 --> 46:54.853
What, after all this time?

46:54.854 --> 46:56.329
The colors of our flags!

46:56.564 --> 46:57.664
What's he saying?

46:57.857 --> 46:59.332
He talks too much. Let him.

46:59.901 --> 47:01.543
How's your mom?

47:01.819 --> 47:03.086
She's fine.

47:06.699 --> 47:09.009
- Did you go to court?
- Yes.

47:10.870 --> 47:13.805
- So, it's over now?
- It was already over.

47:13.873 --> 47:16.057
You still like ravioli?

47:18.544 --> 47:20.061
What's the matter?

47:25.426 --> 47:27.319
You know, this guy...

47:27.386 --> 47:29.779
I don't think he's that bad.

47:29.847 --> 47:33.116
He must be going through
a difficult time.

47:33.434 --> 47:35.452
Put yourself in his shoes.

47:35.520 --> 47:38.855
Between his wife and his
concern for his son...

47:38.856 --> 47:41.249
How can she marry a married man?

47:43.986 --> 47:46.379
You told me his wife was in a coma.

47:46.447 --> 47:48.089
But she's not dead.

47:48.449 --> 47:50.175
She might not die.

47:50.243 --> 47:51.885
That's his problem.

47:56.791 --> 47:58.350
Know why she's in a coma?

47:59.877 --> 48:01.061
No.

48:01.420 --> 48:03.063
How would I know?

48:03.839 --> 48:05.607
My mom didn't tell you?

48:06.384 --> 48:07.525
No.

48:10.471 --> 48:12.447
She committed suicide.

48:16.561 --> 48:18.536
Because of her depression?

48:24.151 --> 48:26.211
Lucie, what's the matter?

48:36.998 --> 48:38.431
Look at me.

48:39.250 --> 48:41.393
Get up, we'll get some fresh air.

48:45.006 --> 48:47.440
- What's the matter?
- We're going out.

48:47.508 --> 48:49.943
Get up, Lucie. Let's go.

48:54.015 --> 48:56.491
Take her in the back.

49:14.368 --> 49:17.887
You know why she doesn't say
his wife committed suicide?

49:17.955 --> 49:19.472
Calm down, we'll talk after.

49:19.540 --> 49:21.808
She doesn't want
anyone to find out.

49:22.585 --> 49:23.810
What?

49:25.129 --> 49:27.689
That it's because of their affair.

49:34.221 --> 49:36.823
You shouldn't speak
with such certainty.

49:38.142 --> 49:39.868
Especially at your age.

49:42.146 --> 49:45.248
Don't say I've grown up
if you don't think so.

49:47.610 --> 49:48.877
Sorry.

49:53.449 --> 49:55.592
I don't want them to be together.

49:57.411 --> 50:00.096
You think it's up to you or me?

50:00.164 --> 50:02.182
I'm nobody in this story.

50:02.249 --> 50:06.186
If they get married, I'll never
set foot in that house again.

50:13.135 --> 50:14.694
Your mother's pregnant.

50:21.143 --> 50:22.243
You're lying.

50:26.190 --> 50:27.373
Wait!

50:30.319 --> 50:31.419
I said wait!

50:31.529 --> 50:34.297
You know why she's
with that asshole?

50:34.615 --> 50:36.508
Because he looks like you.

50:48.295 --> 50:50.563
Grab the keys in my pocket.

50:50.840 --> 50:52.190
The other one.

52:06.874 --> 52:08.308
Good evening.

52:08.375 --> 52:09.976
You're soaked.

52:14.381 --> 52:16.316
It started pouring.

52:19.136 --> 52:20.236
Want a coffee?

52:21.222 --> 52:23.573
I've just come for my suitcase.

52:23.641 --> 52:25.283
I can't miss the last train.

52:25.351 --> 52:26.951
It's right here.

52:27.728 --> 52:29.662
Wait till it stops raining.

52:29.730 --> 52:31.956
It's not stopping soon.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.920
- Is Lucie back?
- No. Watch the paint.

52:45.371 --> 52:47.055
It was delivered broken.

52:47.540 --> 52:50.099
- Did you call her friends?
- No.

52:50.918 --> 52:52.936
I don't dare anymore.

52:56.715 --> 52:58.191
Did you talk to her today?

52:58.259 --> 52:59.525
Yes.

53:00.094 --> 53:02.695
Do you have a piece of string?

53:05.015 --> 53:07.617
You have a suitcase or
two left in the shed.

53:07.685 --> 53:09.243
Help yourself.

53:12.273 --> 53:14.040
Are the kids sleeping?

53:14.483 --> 53:15.708
No.

54:12.833 --> 54:14.600
Turn it on, please.

54:28.182 --> 54:31.701
Can you call the kids?
I'll give them their gifts.

54:31.769 --> 54:33.578
- Fouad, too?
- Of course.

54:33.687 --> 54:35.663
He wasn't supposed to get one.

54:35.731 --> 54:37.874
I got him something today.

54:38.943 --> 54:41.127
Can I ask you not give it to him?

54:42.738 --> 54:44.130
Why?

54:44.907 --> 54:46.841
He's done something wrong.

54:47.159 --> 54:48.593
He needs to be punished.

54:48.869 --> 54:51.387
They should both be punished, then.

54:51.747 --> 54:53.598
I can only speak for my son.

54:55.834 --> 54:57.727
What've they done?

54:57.795 --> 55:00.521
They took the gift out
of your suitcase.

55:02.132 --> 55:04.092
But it was still in there.

55:04.093 --> 55:05.610
I put it back.

55:06.178 --> 55:08.179
We can't let them off the hook.

55:08.180 --> 55:11.057
The suitcase was open,
it was tempting.

55:11.058 --> 55:12.867
I'll ask them to apologize.

55:13.143 --> 55:15.369
So they'll learn apologies
can fix everything.

55:15.813 --> 55:19.732
But I already told
them I brought gifts.

55:19.733 --> 55:22.001
I can't pretend I didn't.

55:22.945 --> 55:24.629
Can you please let go?

55:24.989 --> 55:27.256
I scolded them enough already.

55:27.825 --> 55:29.801
I was just asking.

56:33.724 --> 56:34.949
Good evening.

56:35.642 --> 56:37.185
Good evening, kids.

56:37.186 --> 56:38.286
No.

56:38.479 --> 56:40.580
First, you both have to apologize.

56:44.318 --> 56:45.918
I apologize.

56:49.740 --> 56:51.048
And you?

56:51.200 --> 56:52.925
I didn't take it.

56:52.993 --> 56:54.510
But you were with her?

56:57.206 --> 56:59.682
- But it wasn't me.
- It doesn't matter.

56:59.750 --> 57:02.560
You were together.
You could've stopped her.

57:06.381 --> 57:22.121
"I apologize."

57:24.691 --> 57:26.250
I apologize.

57:29.238 --> 57:30.796
"I apologize."

57:30.864 --> 57:32.340
I apologize.

57:32.407 --> 57:35.718
Look at him, "I apologize."

57:35.786 --> 57:37.511
I apologize.

57:49.133 --> 57:51.275
Now, come get your gifts.

57:54.888 --> 57:56.239
Come on.

57:56.765 --> 57:58.449
You pretended like it was me.

58:00.394 --> 58:02.270
I just said it wasn't me.

58:02.271 --> 58:03.396
That means it was me!

58:03.397 --> 58:04.956
- It was you.
- No.

58:05.732 --> 58:08.167
You told me the suitcase was open.

58:08.235 --> 58:09.902
Or I'd never have gone.

58:09.903 --> 58:13.172
You didn't have to listen.
You didn't have to go.

58:13.490 --> 58:14.866
I know why you're mad.

58:14.867 --> 58:17.660
You didn't get a helicopter,
you got colored pencils.

58:17.661 --> 58:18.886
Shut up!

58:21.540 --> 58:22.748
- You're crazy.
- Shut up.

58:22.749 --> 58:24.517
- You're insane.
- Shut up.

58:30.424 --> 58:32.525
It's the size you used to wear.

58:35.053 --> 58:36.529
I still wear the same size.

58:36.638 --> 58:38.197
I have a gift for Lucie, too.

58:38.765 --> 58:40.950
I'll give it to her later.

58:41.018 --> 58:42.535
Thanks, Ahmad.

58:49.234 --> 58:51.002
You shouldn't smoke.

58:54.114 --> 58:56.340
She's never stayed out this late.

58:59.578 --> 59:01.470
- I'll go look for her.
- Where?

59:01.622 --> 59:04.415
I don't know, nearby,
in the streets, at the station.

59:04.416 --> 59:05.975
Where are the keys?

59:06.043 --> 59:07.351
You had them.

59:07.419 --> 59:09.186
Can I come with you?

59:10.547 --> 59:12.648
Yeah, if you want.

59:18.347 --> 59:21.032
She might not want to
come back with him.

59:31.443 --> 59:33.794
Why did she cry at the restaurant?

59:34.738 --> 59:36.547
Who told you that?

59:36.615 --> 59:39.592
I called Shahryar.
He said she burst into tears.

59:41.245 --> 59:42.553
She's never this late.

59:43.830 --> 59:45.931
What did you tell her?

59:47.960 --> 59:50.561
You hadn't told her
you were pregnant?

59:50.629 --> 59:52.188
You did?

59:53.173 --> 59:55.816
I thought she'd let
it go if she knew.

59:55.884 --> 59:57.902
That's why she's not back.

59:59.137 --> 01:00:02.156
- You weren't supposed to tell her.
- I didn't know.

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:04.784
What kind of secret is that anyway?

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:07.203
She'd have found out someday.

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:09.455
Not when she's so upset.

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:12.249
Her problem is not
your being pregnant.

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.126
What's her problem?

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:18.172
What is her problem?

01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:20.549
She seems to know everything.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.259
Everything about what?

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.638
- I can't find the keys.
- Look for them!

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:30.976
We'll talk later.

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:33.813
What do you mean by
knowing everything?

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:36.649
I don't understand.

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:44.990
She says his wife committed
suicide because of your affair.

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:51.747
- She committed suicide because we...
- I'll call you tomorrow.

01:00:58.363 --> 01:00:59.880
The keys aren't here.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:03.551
- I've got them.
- Then why are you here?

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.970
What do you mean?

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.848
Does somebody mind me being here?

01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:11.684
- No, but...
- Forget it.

01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:13.644
Excuse me.

01:01:19.134 --> 01:01:20.901
Wait, I'm coming.

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:32.079
Ahmad?

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:44.425
What?

01:01:50.165 --> 01:01:51.891
She'd been depressed for a while.

01:01:54.086 --> 01:01:57.021
Every time I went to the
shop, she was unwell.

01:01:58.298 --> 01:01:59.565
Why was she unwell?

01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:02.485
What do you mean why?

01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:04.236
Nothing, forget it.

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:06.697
Say it clearly or say nothing.

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:09.600
You said every time you
saw her, she felt unwell.

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:12.411
I didn't say she felt
unwell, she was unwell!

01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:13.771
She was unwell!

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:15.915
Stop, this is going too far.

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:20.653
You'd like to hear it was my fault.

01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:22.880
I don't want to hear anything.

01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:25.174
You asked me to talk
to your daughter.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:29.286
I'm just telling you what
she thinks, that's it.

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:30.763
She's wrong.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:38.062
- I have to talk to her.
- To say what?

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:41.774
You think she's going to buy that?

01:02:46.555 --> 01:02:48.280
You don't believe me?

01:02:49.558 --> 01:02:52.184
Does that matter? She's the one...

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:54.603
What's unbelievable about it?

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.848
I also doubt that the
mother of a five-year-old

01:02:56.849 --> 01:02:58.983
would kill herself
because she's depressed.

01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:03.295
You're the one saying that?

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:07.800
Have you forgotten the
state you were in?

01:03:17.169 --> 01:03:19.295
She also did it when
he was 9 months old!

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:22.147
Was that my fault, too?
I was with you then!

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:25.693
Her depression started
after the birth.

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:31.615
You want to know what meds
Samir would get for her?

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:39.957
How long are you staying in town?

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:42.876
I haven't booked my return yet.

01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:50.050
Did you have to come?
You couldn't have sent a lawyer?

01:03:50.118 --> 01:03:52.678
Sure but I wanted to come.

01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:55.681
I wanted to see the kids,
and Marie-Anne, too.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.267
To end on good terms.

01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:03.355
It doesn't seem like the end.

01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:06.483
There's still something going on.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:07.693
No.

01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:09.862
What makes you think that?

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:16.560
When two people meet four years
later and start fighting again,

01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:18.562
it means things are
still unresolved.

01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:21.040
We were arguing about Lucie.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.791
Lucie's problem is me.

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:27.004
No, it's a misunderstanding.

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:28.505
About what?

01:04:33.954 --> 01:04:36.430
It's personal, I can't know?

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:39.725
- No...
- In that case, tell me.

01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:42.936
You may know Marie's
carrying my child.

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:45.464
She smokes, she's stressed out...

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:47.733
I'm worried about her, too.

01:04:47.759 --> 01:04:49.693
She didn't use to smoke.

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:55.157
I won't let her destroy her mother.
If she has a problem...

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:58.477
She has no problem.
It's a misunderstanding.

01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:01.330
What is it? It's been
screwing up our lives!

01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:04.149
Marie-Anne can tell you.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:05.584
Leave her out of this.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.217
She's making assumptions
about your wife.

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:21.750
She thinks she killed
herself because of us?

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.268
So you know...

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.422
I heard you.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:27.690
Did you?

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:36.115
She did that because of a
stupid story with a customer.

01:05:39.728 --> 01:05:41.328
I heard she was depressed.

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:44.289
If she hadn't been, she wouldn't
have tried to kill herself

01:05:44.316 --> 01:05:45.833
for nothing.

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:50.546
What can I do if Lucie
doesn't believe me?

01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:54.550
I can send her my employee.
She saw the whole thing.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:19.032
We should call the police.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:21.785
Has she already
stayed out all night?

01:06:21.936 --> 01:06:23.829
No, it's the first time.

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:28.000
Maybe she went to her father's.

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:30.169
In Brussels?

01:06:31.071 --> 01:06:32.921
He's not in Paris anymore?

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:35.758
He's back in Brussels.

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:38.135
You think she can be there?

01:06:38.703 --> 01:06:39.845
No.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:43.390
She's on bad terms with him, too.

01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:50.814
You want me to call?

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:56.195
It's better if you do it.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.417
I doubt she'd have
gone to Brussels.

01:07:14.948 --> 01:07:16.673
Fine, I'll do it.

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:19.384
Okay, give me his number.

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:23.847
Shahryar called twice.
Call him back.

01:07:23.915 --> 01:07:26.016
- Where's the phone?
- In the kitchen.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:37.236
Where did she get this idea?

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:38.737
What idea?

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:42.574
About Céline's suicide.

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:48.413
I don't know.

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:56.088
No.

01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:57.923
Okay, thanks.

01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:00.634
Thank you. Take care. Bye.

01:08:00.702 --> 01:08:01.785
- Here.
- What is it?

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:03.428
Her father's number.

01:08:03.955 --> 01:08:05.764
Don't worry him. He's fragile.

01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:07.599
She's at Shahryar's.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.481
She went to the restaurant
and he took her in.

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.821
But he called twice.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.906
Why didn't he tell me?

01:08:25.185 --> 01:08:27.286
He heard how worried I was.

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:30.247
- Let me...
- Why didn't he tell me she was there?

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:33.750
I was worried sick!
I've been sick all night!

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:35.419
I'll explain...

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:37.962
Explain what?

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.965
What do you want to explain?

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.411
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:47.163
I already asked you
to go through me!

01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:49.308
I ask you not to raise your voice.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:51.977
Why didn't he tell
me she was there?

01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:53.645
Lucie made him promise.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:54.880
Who?

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:57.482
She'd only stay if he told no one.

01:08:57.634 --> 01:09:01.303
- He promised to hide a 16-year-old?
- What do you mean hide?

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:04.448
- Why did he hide her?
- He felt sorry for her.

01:09:04.724 --> 01:09:07.408
- Didn't he feel sorry for her mother?
- The keys.

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:09.995
- Where are you going?
- She has to come home.

01:09:10.063 --> 01:09:12.163
Sit her ass down and listen!

01:09:12.232 --> 01:09:13.497
- Now?
- Right now!

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:15.082
She thinks we don't know.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:16.710
I don't care!

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:22.758
I want her to see the
mess she's put me in!

01:09:22.826 --> 01:09:24.551
See her suicide's not my fault!

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:31.183
If you go, she won't come.

01:09:31.209 --> 01:09:34.185
Then, I'll call the police.
I swear I will.

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:37.606
The police will bring her
tonight. And after?

01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:42.527
Either she comes here or
she goes to her father's.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.033
She won't come as long as I'm here.

01:10:05.243 --> 01:10:06.718
Come in.

01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:10.013
- Hello.
- Hello. Took you long enough.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:13.392
Don't you have an umbrella?

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:15.102
No.

01:10:15.962 --> 01:10:17.646
Leave it here.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:21.274
- How did you get here?
- I took the metro.

01:10:21.342 --> 01:10:22.651
Why not a taxi?

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:24.444
I couldn't find one.

01:10:24.512 --> 01:10:26.822
Hardly here and already in trouble.

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.573
Is she awake?

01:10:29.601 --> 01:10:30.701
She's asleep.

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:33.954
- When did she come by?
- It was late. Probably to find you.

01:10:34.022 --> 01:10:36.999
Why didn't you call us? Her
mother would have picked her up.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:39.584
How could I call you?
You don't have a phone.

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:42.504
I called their house
and you weren't there.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:46.258
I was scared to tell her mother,
scared she'd leave.

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:47.801
What's wrong with her?

01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:50.846
She's imagining things.

01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:15.495
Sorry to wake you.
Your mom's waiting.

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:24.337
She wanted to come,
I asked her not to.

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:27.591
Come on, get up.

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:29.076
Where's your jacket?

01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:30.635
I won't go.

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:34.681
I don't want to go back tonight.

01:11:38.211 --> 01:11:40.437
I'll call her and you talk to her.

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:55.994
Marie-Anne? Hold on, please.

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:06.630
I'm staying here tonight.

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:13.136
Why did you hang up?

01:12:13.246 --> 01:12:14.888
She did.

01:12:20.962 --> 01:12:22.604
Let's go.

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.022
No.

01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:33.615
Get out of bed.

01:12:33.725 --> 01:12:35.450
Let's go talk.

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:54.511
I want you to listen carefully.

01:12:56.372 --> 01:13:00.225
Remember the last few months
I lived with your mom?

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:02.477
Remember?

01:13:07.925 --> 01:13:10.235
Remember the state I was in?

01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:14.681
I was down all the time.
I wasn't working...

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:16.449
I stopped going out...

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:19.077
I didn't want to exist.

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:23.190
So when your mom says
depression caused her suicide,

01:13:23.191 --> 01:13:25.167
I know what it means.

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:27.778
Even with a young child.

01:13:27.779 --> 01:13:30.297
Did you often think
of killing yourself?

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.259
Yes, sometimes.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.888
By drinking detergent
in front of Léa and me?

01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:39.598
What?

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:41.808
No.

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:48.940
You think a woman who goes
to her husband's shop,

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:52.736
drinks detergent in front
of her son and collapses

01:13:54.388 --> 01:13:56.740
simply wants to die?

01:14:00.019 --> 01:14:03.288
Why didn't she take pills
and die in her bed?

01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:12.130
We can spend the night
imagining things.

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:15.008
But it's all speculation.

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:19.262
We'll see Samir's
employee tomorrow.

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:21.181
She has things to tell you.

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:34.986
No...

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:44.204
Tell her I've left and
she can come back.

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:54.172
It's better if Fouad and I
don't live here for a while.

01:15:50.963 --> 01:15:52.731
Come on, Fouad, let's go.

01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:21.760
That's enough, come on.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:24.012
- Let me go.
- Come with me, I said.

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:27.599
That's enough, Fouad!

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:29.059
Let go!

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:32.937
Thank you.

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:34.814
What was that about?

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:38.068
When I say get off, get off!

01:16:38.177 --> 01:16:39.819
Look at me!

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:42.197
Listen to me when I'm
speaking to you.

01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:43.932
Leave me alone.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:45.617
What did you say?

01:16:45.685 --> 01:16:47.202
Leave me alone.

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:51.289
Never do that again.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.625
Look at me.

01:16:53.693 --> 01:16:55.335
What was that about?

01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:08.973
Your pillow.

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:10.475
No.

01:17:13.212 --> 01:17:14.604
What's wrong?

01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:22.821
What's the matter, Fouad?

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:26.199
- Tell me!
- I want to go back to Marie's.

01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:29.285
We have to go home for now.

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:32.122
You told me our home was there,

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:34.040
forever.

01:17:34.859 --> 01:17:37.127
Yes, but some things have changed.

01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:40.463
It's because of the man who came?

01:17:41.741 --> 01:17:42.841
No.

01:17:43.743 --> 01:17:45.176
Because I misbehaved yesterday?

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:46.594
No...

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.390
Why doesn't Lucie like you?

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.647
She thinks I want to
take her mommy away.

01:17:58.424 --> 01:18:00.024
She doesn't like her mommy.

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:01.234
Of course she does.

01:18:01.302 --> 01:18:03.027
All children do.

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:06.364
Like you, you miss your mommy.

01:18:11.103 --> 01:18:13.121
But Mommy's not home anymore.

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:17.275
You want to go see her tomorrow?

01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:18.376
No.

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:22.046
Why?

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:26.050
She scares me.

01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:28.011
Your mommy?

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.722
She's dead.

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:34.350
Don't say such things, Fouad.

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:38.129
If she was dead,
they wouldn't keep her

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:40.231
at the hospital with the machines.

01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:44.611
If they take them
away, will she die?

01:18:54.647 --> 01:18:56.623
Why don't they take them away?

01:19:01.612 --> 01:19:07.509
Because we don't know if she
wants to live like this or die.

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:10.470
She wants to die.

01:19:12.164 --> 01:19:13.473
Why do you say that?

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:16.601
She killed herself.
She wanted to die.

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:33.910
Sorry, Daddy.

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:44.587
There.

01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:46.673
That's the stain.

01:19:47.408 --> 01:19:49.409
Did his wife work there, too?

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:51.578
Yeah, for a few days,

01:19:51.579 --> 01:19:56.140
Samir would bring her
there to clear her head.

01:19:58.043 --> 01:20:01.629
And that day, Céline had a fight...

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.089
Céline is Samir's wife?

01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:04.983
Yes, she's Samir's wife.

01:20:05.259 --> 01:20:07.135
She had a fight with a customer.

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:11.072
The customer said that the dry
cleaner had made the stain,

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:14.367
and Céline said it
was there before.

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:18.646
That's all?

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:23.293
To make things better, I said we'd
clean the dress for the day after.

01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:25.445
And then Céline got mad at me,

01:20:25.446 --> 01:20:27.780
"Who asked you?

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:30.341
"I'm the boss here.

01:20:30.701 --> 01:20:33.720
"The stain isn't the
dry cleaner's fault."

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:36.180
And she threw the dress
on the sidewalk.

01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:39.726
Then the customer called the
police to make a complaint.

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:44.022
So, I wanted to leave.

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:46.691
- You work illegally?
- Yes.

01:20:46.884 --> 01:20:50.695
But Céline said I had
to stay as a witness

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:54.532
to tell the police that the
stain was there before.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:58.786
So I called Samir without her
seeing me and asked him to come.

01:20:59.146 --> 01:21:02.665
He came and he said
sorry to the customer.

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:06.753
He said he'd give her
money for a new dress.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:10.882
And the customer said
she'd agree but only if

01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:13.426
Céline apologized.

01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:16.554
And Céline said no.

01:21:16.622 --> 01:21:18.222
She started yelling at me,

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:20.391
asking why I'd called Samir.

01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:23.728
I grabbed my things to go away.

01:21:23.963 --> 01:21:26.564
But then Samir came and he took...

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:28.399
He took my hand like this,

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:32.512
and he asked me to stay.

01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:35.907
And he asked his wife to leave.

01:21:35.975 --> 01:21:38.242
He threw her out in
front of the customer,

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:40.119
in front of me,

01:21:40.187 --> 01:21:41.788
and I stayed.

01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:44.499
How long before her
suicide was that?

01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:47.919
Four, five days.

01:21:52.992 --> 01:21:54.467
Can I go?

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:55.968
Thank you.

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:19.867
- Sir! Aren't you going to give us a tea?
- Right away.

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:23.871
That's what depression's like.

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:26.958
Small things can set you off.

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.838
The day before her suicide,

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:38.428
I forwarded her all the love letters
my mom and Samir e-mailed each other.

01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:30.646
What are you going to do now?

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:35.193
I'll go to Brussels.

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.069
Don't be silly.

01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:39.447
You wouldn't last a minute there.

01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:41.532
You have to go back to your mom's.

01:23:44.228 --> 01:23:47.997
I can't face a guy whose
wife is dead because of me.

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:50.500
I can't look his son in the eyes.

01:23:53.487 --> 01:23:55.087
Come sit down.

01:24:04.957 --> 01:24:07.350
- You want my help?
- Don't tell my mom.

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:09.060
- Listen.
- I don't want her to know.

01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:10.478
Sit down!

01:24:17.010 --> 01:24:18.152
Sit down.

01:24:22.182 --> 01:24:23.741
I shouldn't have told you.

01:24:23.809 --> 01:24:25.743
Wait, listen.

01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:27.411
You have two options,

01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:31.582
either you keep this secret and
suffer for the rest of your life,

01:24:31.734 --> 01:24:33.751
or you talk to your mom.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.587
What'd that change?

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:39.257
It might change her
decision to marry him.

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:40.842
Her decision's made.
She's pregnant.

01:24:43.162 --> 01:24:47.390
What if she finds out
after the child's born?

01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:49.183
It'd really be too late.

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:54.438
If I'd felt like telling
her, I'd have done it.

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:58.693
It's not about feeling
like it or not.

01:24:59.678 --> 01:25:02.947
Ask yourself if it's
important for your mother.

01:25:07.102 --> 01:25:08.619
She has the right to know.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.925
Hi, Mom!

01:25:23.577 --> 01:25:24.886
Hey, you.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.179
- Can you open the door?
- Did you buy chips?

01:25:27.748 --> 01:25:29.473
Yes, I bought some.

01:25:51.230 --> 01:25:52.330
You're here?

01:25:52.356 --> 01:25:54.332
I was upstairs with Lucie.

01:25:56.235 --> 01:25:57.376
You okay?

01:25:58.904 --> 01:26:00.713
How was your meeting?

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:03.549
What meeting?

01:26:04.243 --> 01:26:06.344
With Samir's employee.

01:26:06.787 --> 01:26:08.846
Yeah. It was fine.

01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:12.683
And so?

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:16.812
Had you told Lucie I
was coming to Paris?

01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:18.464
No.

01:26:18.465 --> 01:26:20.232
How did she know, then?

01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:22.443
Did she know?

01:26:25.848 --> 01:26:28.115
- How?
- I don't know.

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:31.369
Maybe she reads your e-mails.

01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:34.939
Where do you keep this?

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.582
Did something happen?

01:26:43.156 --> 01:26:44.991
Shall we go for a walk?

01:26:44.992 --> 01:26:46.717
No, I'm tired.

01:26:49.246 --> 01:26:50.888
What's the matter, Ahmad?

01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:58.229
You want to go live with Dad?

01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:01.983
If you go, I'll come with you.

01:27:04.136 --> 01:27:06.112
You have to stay here with Mom.

01:27:06.471 --> 01:27:08.406
I want to be with you.

01:27:09.808 --> 01:27:11.617
It's not a good idea.

01:27:16.481 --> 01:27:18.582
Dad's wife is a bit weird.

01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:43.649
It's going to be fine.

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:14.597
Is what he said true?

01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:23.647
Why did you do that to me?

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:27.401
What did I do to you, little shit?

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:29.737
What did I ever do to you?

01:28:30.347 --> 01:28:32.239
Stop it, Marie!

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:34.325
What are you doing?

01:28:34.768 --> 01:28:36.368
Calm down!

01:28:37.104 --> 01:28:38.204
Easy...

01:28:38.897 --> 01:28:41.040
- Stop it!
- Get your hands off me!

01:28:43.568 --> 01:28:45.336
You promised not to do that.

01:28:45.362 --> 01:28:48.339
Get out of this house!

01:28:48.573 --> 01:28:50.883
- Don't stay here, go.
- Let me go!

01:28:51.034 --> 01:28:53.010
She's in enough pain.

01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:58.682
I asked her to tell you.

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:01.560
She could've stopped
me from telling you.

01:29:01.628 --> 01:29:04.396
I could've asked her
to keep the secret.

01:29:05.257 --> 01:29:08.192
- You'd have preferred that?
- Will you shut up!

01:29:10.429 --> 01:29:13.305
What're you doing here? Get lost!

01:29:13.306 --> 01:29:15.032
I don't want you in this house!

01:29:15.058 --> 01:29:19.495
- Get out of my sight!
- Stop it!

01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:22.289
Go to your room.

01:29:23.108 --> 01:29:24.333
Go, darling.

01:29:28.155 --> 01:29:31.882
Remember you're the one
who wrote those e-mails.

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:33.217
She just forwarded them.

01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:35.386
I don't want to hear you. Go away.

01:29:36.038 --> 01:29:39.056
I hate it when you lecture me.

01:29:39.166 --> 01:29:41.725
- It disgusts me!
- I'm not lecturing you!

01:29:42.502 --> 01:29:45.671
You asked me to come
here and talk to Lucie!

01:29:45.672 --> 01:29:48.399
Fuck off! I didn't ask
you here for Lucie!

01:29:48.467 --> 01:29:51.235
I asked you to sign
that fucking piece of paper

01:29:51.344 --> 01:29:54.430
after four years, and
then get lost forever!

01:29:54.431 --> 01:29:55.739
Listen.

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:59.785
Why didn't you ask me
to come last year?

01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:04.231
Why do I have to be here
in the middle of this shit...

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:05.399
Screw you.

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.877
not knowing you're
getting married?

01:30:07.944 --> 01:30:09.403
Read your e-mails!

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:11.822
- And you didn't book a hotel.
- What?

01:30:11.823 --> 01:30:15.242
And you made me sleep
next to his son.

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:16.635
Why?

01:30:18.872 --> 01:30:22.141
- I sent you an e-mail...
- You had me here to get revenge.

01:30:22.209 --> 01:30:23.767
That's all it's about.

01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:26.812
Yeah, that's it. You're right!
Happy?

01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:33.986
Just before seeing the judge,

01:30:35.388 --> 01:30:37.448
you tell me you're pregnant.

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:38.866
Why?

01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:49.460
Don't you want to get out of here?

01:30:50.028 --> 01:30:52.963
Just leave for good?

01:30:55.575 --> 01:30:56.909
Please...

01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:58.177
She's leaving!

01:31:04.042 --> 01:31:06.544
Lucie, where are you going?
Come back!

01:31:06.545 --> 01:31:08.229
Who are you to boss me around?

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.648
Please, don't make it worse.

01:31:11.049 --> 01:31:13.275
- Your mom's not well.
- Why'd you tell her?

01:31:13.385 --> 01:31:14.568
You agreed.

01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:16.512
You left me no choice.

01:31:16.513 --> 01:31:18.405
I wanted to spare you suffering.

01:31:20.892 --> 01:31:22.826
Am I not suffering now?

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:26.163
Am I well?

01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:34.046
Wait.

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:52.398
Can you lend me some money?

01:31:53.008 --> 01:31:54.942
Wait, I'll come with you.

01:31:58.763 --> 01:32:00.072
Wait.

01:32:07.272 --> 01:32:08.872
I'll go.

01:32:37.302 --> 01:32:39.486
Can I ask you a question?

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:41.613
What?

01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:45.993
What was in those e-mails?

01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:47.494
I don't know.

01:33:13.713 --> 01:33:14.938
Come home.

01:33:35.819 --> 01:33:37.586
Ahmad, look at me.

01:33:38.947 --> 01:33:40.798
Don't get sucked back into this.

01:33:43.076 --> 01:33:44.927
Remember Mitra and me?

01:33:49.332 --> 01:33:51.683
Life goes on without you and me.

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:58.424
I think to myself, if I
hadn't left four years ago...

01:33:58.425 --> 01:34:01.110
You'd have left a year later.

01:34:01.177 --> 01:34:03.028
Or two years later.

01:34:04.597 --> 01:34:06.824
You were not made for this place.

01:34:08.893 --> 01:34:10.828
I told you from the beginning.

01:34:10.895 --> 01:34:12.663
You have to choose.
It's either one way or the other.

01:34:12.772 --> 01:34:15.541
You can't have it both ways.

01:34:15.608 --> 01:34:17.876
Because as you go, those
paths get further apart.

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:40.441
You want to tell him?

01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:46.071
You don't have to.

01:34:52.562 --> 01:34:53.954
Go to bed.

01:34:57.859 --> 01:34:59.710
Turn off the light, please.

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.988
- Is Samir here?
- Yes, upstairs.

01:35:34.896 --> 01:35:35.979
Hello.

01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.664
Hello, Fouad.

01:35:55.625 --> 01:35:57.518
- How's it going?
- Okay.

01:35:57.585 --> 01:35:59.686
- You're not busy?
- No.

01:35:59.754 --> 01:36:01.522
Come in, I'll be right there.

01:36:11.766 --> 01:36:14.284
- What's all this?
- Her perfumes.

01:36:16.563 --> 01:36:19.289
I'm taking them to the
hospital for a test.

01:36:19.357 --> 01:36:22.834
A nurse said the memory of
smells is the last one you lose.

01:36:35.957 --> 01:36:37.307
That one's yours.

01:36:40.879 --> 01:36:42.479
She liked it.

01:36:47.802 --> 01:36:48.902
What?

01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:50.904
Nothing.

01:36:57.896 --> 01:36:59.329
Why don't you come in?

01:36:59.397 --> 01:37:00.998
I have to go.

01:37:06.905 --> 01:37:09.172
I don't like it when you
hide your feelings.

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:11.174
I'm not hiding anything.

01:37:11.242 --> 01:37:12.910
You mean you're not happy?

01:37:12.911 --> 01:37:15.262
It's good if she can
still react, no?

01:37:17.248 --> 01:37:19.016
What do you want me to say?

01:37:33.348 --> 01:37:35.741
You're stuck between
your wife and me.

01:37:41.773 --> 01:37:43.707
You realized that overnight?

01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:50.505
I've felt it for a long time.

01:37:50.615 --> 01:37:52.090
Since when?

01:37:54.619 --> 01:37:55.886
What do you mean?

01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:02.392
You didn't say things like
that until last week.

01:38:07.966 --> 01:38:10.776
I wasn't brave enough
to tell you earlier.

01:38:11.636 --> 01:38:13.737
Maybe I wasn't sure of what I felt.

01:38:15.098 --> 01:38:16.573
What do you feel?

01:38:17.976 --> 01:38:20.869
That I'm here to fill the
void left by your wife.

01:38:23.106 --> 01:38:25.749
Whose void am I
filling in your life?

01:38:28.486 --> 01:38:30.587
- No one's.
- You're sure?

01:38:32.323 --> 01:38:35.258
I'm not here to make up
for your failed marriage?

01:38:38.496 --> 01:38:40.472
I wouldn't be carrying your child.

01:38:40.582 --> 01:38:42.224
That was an accident.

01:38:51.843 --> 01:38:53.026
I could've not kept it.

01:38:59.350 --> 01:39:01.952
You kept it to erase that man,

01:39:03.062 --> 01:39:06.273
convince yourself you'd turned
the page, that it was over.

01:39:06.274 --> 01:39:08.458
But you're still not convinced.

01:39:10.028 --> 01:39:13.171
Otherwise, you'd have
let him go to a hotel.

01:39:16.701 --> 01:39:19.594
You think I can't see
the state you're in?

01:39:20.288 --> 01:39:22.139
I don't recognize you anymore.

01:39:26.002 --> 01:39:28.712
It's because I know why
your wife killed herself.

01:39:28.713 --> 01:39:30.897
Leave her out of this, please.

01:39:32.634 --> 01:39:35.569
- She knew everything.
- You sound like your crazy daughter.

01:39:47.607 --> 01:39:48.999
If she'd known,

01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:51.126
she'd have said something to me.

01:40:04.916 --> 01:40:06.183
She never asked about me?

01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:08.852
Ask what?

01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:11.188
I don't know.

01:40:11.631 --> 01:40:13.940
Why I came in so often.

01:40:16.886 --> 01:40:18.570
For her, you were a customer.

01:40:22.809 --> 01:40:24.159
She didn't suspect you?

01:40:24.602 --> 01:40:25.702
No.

01:40:28.648 --> 01:40:29.915
I wish she had.

01:40:30.775 --> 01:40:33.293
I wish she'd wondered
if there was someone.

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:37.005
It'd have meant she cared.

01:41:29.834 --> 01:41:31.601
Lucie sent her our e-mails.

01:41:40.845 --> 01:41:42.404
How'd she get her address?

01:41:44.849 --> 01:41:46.700
Your wife gave it to her.

01:41:46.893 --> 01:41:48.577
But they never met.

01:41:49.187 --> 01:41:51.162
Lucie called her at the shop,

01:41:51.731 --> 01:41:54.666
said she had e-mails
we'd sent each other

01:41:55.359 --> 01:41:57.294
that she wanted to forward.

01:42:00.031 --> 01:42:01.631
Your wife accepted.

01:42:13.711 --> 01:42:15.520
When did she call her?

01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:19.900
The day before her suicide.

01:42:39.737 --> 01:42:42.172
Naïma, come here a second.

01:42:54.961 --> 01:42:57.145
After the fight with Céline...

01:42:57.421 --> 01:42:59.439
You know, when I asked her to go?

01:43:00.675 --> 01:43:02.692
Did she ever come by the shop?

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:03.860
No.

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:08.031
Not even on her way home?

01:43:08.057 --> 01:43:10.408
I didn't see her do that.

01:43:21.445 --> 01:43:22.879
She never came down?

01:43:24.782 --> 01:43:26.675
Except the day it happened.

01:43:26.868 --> 01:43:28.468
Not the day before?

01:43:28.536 --> 01:43:30.053
No, why?

01:43:30.121 --> 01:43:33.473
Someone says she called
here and talked to my wife.

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.063
Go ahead.

01:43:42.008 --> 01:43:43.108
Hello, ma'am.

01:43:52.977 --> 01:43:55.412
Here. Can you take care of this?

01:45:09.971 --> 01:45:11.488
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:45:21.232 --> 01:45:23.458
Promise not to lie to me again.

01:45:29.532 --> 01:45:31.633
When did I lie to you?

01:45:37.498 --> 01:45:39.974
When you said you'd
sent the e-mails.

01:45:46.841 --> 01:45:48.358
You promise?

01:45:52.471 --> 01:45:53.696
Okay?

01:45:56.934 --> 01:45:59.369
Why do you think it was a lie?

01:46:02.690 --> 01:46:05.708
She wasn't at the shop the
day before her suicide.

01:46:23.169 --> 01:46:24.894
I spoke to her.

01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:27.897
- No.
- Yes.

01:46:28.632 --> 01:46:30.233
She had an accent.

01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:32.068
His wife is French.

01:46:47.943 --> 01:46:49.085
Morning.

01:47:08.589 --> 01:47:10.273
Why did you do it?

01:47:10.299 --> 01:47:11.399
What?

01:47:12.218 --> 01:47:15.178
- Why did you do it?
- Do what?

01:47:15.179 --> 01:47:17.906
Why'd you pretend to be my
wife and give her e-mail?

01:47:24.522 --> 01:47:25.622
Forgive me.

01:47:30.111 --> 01:47:32.879
I'm not asking for an apology,
I'm asking why.

01:47:36.784 --> 01:47:37.884
Tell me!

01:47:38.702 --> 01:47:39.802
She didn't like me.

01:47:40.037 --> 01:47:41.679
She didn't like you?

01:47:42.164 --> 01:47:43.581
- Did you do something to her?
- No.

01:47:43.582 --> 01:47:44.807
Why didn't she like you?

01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:53.983
She thought there was
something between us.

01:47:54.051 --> 01:47:56.945
She thought that? Why would she?

01:47:59.390 --> 01:48:01.783
Since you hired me,

01:48:02.059 --> 01:48:04.410
even though I'm illegal,
she was suspicious.

01:48:04.603 --> 01:48:06.563
Did she say anything to you?

01:48:06.564 --> 01:48:07.664
No.

01:48:07.690 --> 01:48:09.999
Where are you getting
this crap, then?

01:48:12.111 --> 01:48:15.588
She was always after
me, so I thought...

01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:17.840
You thought?

01:48:22.496 --> 01:48:23.888
Get out.

01:48:24.957 --> 01:48:27.141
She never asked me to fire you.

01:48:27.209 --> 01:48:29.519
- But she did things...
- Let go!

01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:33.047
things to get you to fire me.

01:48:33.048 --> 01:48:34.816
What kind of things?

01:48:38.012 --> 01:48:40.947
Tell me, what kind of things?

01:48:43.142 --> 01:48:45.034
- Many things.
- Like what?

01:48:45.519 --> 01:48:46.936
Like what?

01:48:46.937 --> 01:48:48.246
Sorry...

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.873
Like what?

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.712
The day of the fight,

01:48:55.779 --> 01:48:57.880
the customer called the police,

01:48:57.948 --> 01:49:00.842
and Céline wanted me to stay.

01:49:01.202 --> 01:49:02.552
So what?

01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:05.388
She wanted the police
to find out about me.

01:49:07.291 --> 01:49:08.558
That's it?

01:49:09.627 --> 01:49:11.728
That's why she's in a coma?

01:49:13.797 --> 01:49:15.131
Get out.

01:49:15.132 --> 01:49:18.901
That dress, I'm the one who
took it out of the machine.

01:49:20.137 --> 01:49:22.905
I took it, I ironed it
and I wrapped it up.

01:49:22.973 --> 01:49:24.365
- There was no stain.
- Out!

01:49:24.391 --> 01:49:26.517
She made the stain, I'm sure.

01:49:26.518 --> 01:49:28.394
I've been here for a year.

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:31.080
I've never seen a stain like that.

01:49:31.273 --> 01:49:33.041
How much do I owe you?

01:49:33.692 --> 01:49:35.251
I work here every day...

01:49:35.319 --> 01:49:37.045
There was no stain, I swear.

01:49:37.071 --> 01:49:39.697
I do the laundry every day.
There are no stains.

01:49:39.698 --> 01:49:42.216
Céline must have made it. I swear!

01:49:48.749 --> 01:49:50.099
Get lost!

01:49:53.170 --> 01:49:54.395
Out.

01:50:47.057 --> 01:50:49.158
I wanted her to know there
was nothing between us.

01:50:51.895 --> 01:50:54.664
You were upset all the time,

01:50:54.732 --> 01:50:58.000
thinking about someone else
and she thought it was me.

01:51:05.117 --> 01:51:06.926
The day of the fight,

01:51:07.953 --> 01:51:10.138
you asked me to stay,
you took my hand,

01:51:10.205 --> 01:51:12.306
and you asked her to leave.

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.768
I saw her eyes for a second.

01:51:18.130 --> 01:51:19.897
I saw what she thought.

01:51:21.467 --> 01:51:23.276
Because of what you did,

01:51:24.094 --> 01:51:25.903
my kid's mother

01:51:26.472 --> 01:51:28.406
has been a vegetable
for eight months.

01:51:32.478 --> 01:51:34.120
It's not because of what I did.

01:51:34.188 --> 01:51:37.290
You gave her e-mail to that brat.

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:42.962
If she would have read them,
she'd have understood everything.

01:51:46.241 --> 01:51:49.719
Why would she have drunk the
detergent in front of me?

01:51:49.787 --> 01:51:53.097
She'd have done it in front of her,
at the pharmacy.

01:51:53.165 --> 01:51:55.183
Or in front of you, upstairs.

01:51:55.667 --> 01:51:57.643
Why in front of me?

01:52:26.073 --> 01:52:27.173
Naïma!

01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:55.117
She's not coming back?

01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:57.411
Who?

01:52:58.689 --> 01:53:00.248
Naïma.

01:53:02.359 --> 01:53:03.501
No.

01:53:06.864 --> 01:53:08.172
Why?

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:12.635
Because she did something wrong.

01:53:16.665 --> 01:53:18.558
But she apologized.

01:53:22.921 --> 01:53:24.564
Some things are unforgivable.

01:53:26.675 --> 01:53:28.192
Like what?

01:53:32.764 --> 01:53:34.073
What happened here?

01:53:34.141 --> 01:53:35.533
Nothing.

01:53:39.855 --> 01:53:41.789
I want to go to Léa's.

01:53:44.610 --> 01:53:46.419
We can't for now.

01:53:50.782 --> 01:53:52.008
When, then?

01:53:54.745 --> 01:53:55.845
When?

01:53:59.750 --> 01:54:01.851
When we know about Mommy.

01:54:02.252 --> 01:54:03.394
When will we know?

01:54:03.504 --> 01:54:05.062
I don't know.

01:54:09.635 --> 01:54:11.694
I get bored here by myself.

01:54:15.933 --> 01:54:18.367
Why don't you come down to see me?

01:54:21.313 --> 01:54:23.205
I don't like it downstairs.

01:55:22.416 --> 01:55:23.724
Hello.

01:55:25.544 --> 01:55:26.977
Go upstairs, Fouad.

01:55:27.045 --> 01:55:28.270
You okay?

01:55:29.339 --> 01:55:31.732
And then I'll go to Marie's?

01:55:34.553 --> 01:55:36.278
Go get your things.

01:55:45.397 --> 01:55:47.581
Make a drawing for Mommy, okay?

01:56:12.090 --> 01:56:13.315
Sit down.

01:56:27.564 --> 01:56:29.707
You think she got our e-mails?

01:56:33.904 --> 01:56:35.029
I don't know.

01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:36.797
If she'd read them,

01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:42.094
she'd have said something.

01:56:42.204 --> 01:56:45.765
Since the fight with the customer,
we'd stopped speaking.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.642
It lasted until the end.

01:56:50.253 --> 01:56:52.229
Even if she'd read them,

01:56:52.798 --> 01:56:54.440
you said yesterday

01:56:55.967 --> 01:56:58.652
that she wouldn't have cared.

01:57:04.267 --> 01:57:05.659
Would she have cared?

01:57:08.939 --> 01:57:10.039
Maybe.

01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:14.376
I don't know.
I'd rather talk about now.

01:57:14.444 --> 01:57:16.962
That was then. It's over.

01:57:18.490 --> 01:57:21.425
What I know is that you're
carrying our child.

01:57:21.493 --> 01:57:23.594
We have to forget.

01:57:24.913 --> 01:57:26.055
Is that possible?

01:57:26.581 --> 01:57:28.641
It should be.

01:57:33.213 --> 01:57:34.730
What if it isn't?

01:57:54.151 --> 01:57:56.085
Is your wrist better?

01:57:56.153 --> 01:57:57.753
It still hurts a bit.

01:57:58.905 --> 01:58:00.756
You went to see a doctor?

01:58:00.824 --> 01:58:03.759
Lack of calcium.
The baby's taking it all.

01:58:04.995 --> 01:58:06.595
How far along are you?

01:58:10.333 --> 01:58:12.059
A bit more than two months.

01:58:12.836 --> 01:58:15.145
I thought you'd hurt
yourself painting.

01:58:18.675 --> 01:58:20.234
I don't know.

01:58:20.969 --> 01:58:22.444
It's possible.

01:58:41.865 --> 01:58:45.467
There's something I want
to tell you before I go.

01:58:48.747 --> 01:58:50.431
About what?

01:58:57.214 --> 01:58:59.857
About when I left four years ago.

01:59:03.053 --> 01:59:04.445
No need now.

01:59:08.934 --> 01:59:11.660
- I want to explain why I didn't...
- No.

01:59:14.815 --> 01:59:17.166
I don't want to look back anymore.

01:59:19.069 --> 01:59:20.502
Forget it.

01:59:34.501 --> 01:59:36.185
I'm off, then.

01:59:36.211 --> 01:59:38.187
And your things in the shed?

01:59:40.298 --> 01:59:41.565
I don't want them.

01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:44.902
Take them.

01:59:52.435 --> 01:59:53.911
Goodbye.

01:59:54.396 --> 01:59:55.537
What are you doing?

01:59:55.605 --> 01:59:57.915
Trying to get the helicopter.

01:59:59.484 --> 02:00:00.876
It's stuck up there.

02:00:02.904 --> 02:00:04.088
You already broke it.

02:00:04.155 --> 02:00:06.548
No, it's just stuck!

02:00:09.911 --> 02:00:12.680
- Can you get it?
- I have to see.

02:00:12.747 --> 02:00:14.598
Careful, there...

02:00:14.666 --> 02:00:16.266
Pull!

02:00:20.964 --> 02:00:22.690
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

02:00:23.174 --> 02:00:24.817
I'm leaving.

02:00:25.218 --> 02:00:27.236
- Bye, Fouad.
- Bye.

02:00:39.149 --> 02:00:40.499
Bye.

02:01:33.244 --> 02:01:35.679
Unfortunately, she had no reaction.

02:01:37.290 --> 02:01:39.808
- None?
- None that I registered.

02:01:41.378 --> 02:01:45.272
The scratches on her
stomach were involuntary?

02:01:46.049 --> 02:01:47.941
Possibly. As I told you,

02:01:47.968 --> 02:01:51.612
these tests don't reflect
her state of consciousness.

02:01:52.514 --> 02:01:54.698
She'd never scratched
herself before.

02:01:55.517 --> 02:01:57.326
I can't say.

02:01:57.394 --> 02:02:00.746
The nurses may have done
it when moving her.

02:02:00.855 --> 02:02:03.332
These patients have fragile skin.

02:02:04.901 --> 02:02:06.335
Doctor,

02:02:06.569 --> 02:02:09.338
how can I be sure it's not her?

02:02:09.406 --> 02:02:10.672
By doing more tests.

02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:15.260
But even if they're negative,
there will be room for doubt.

02:02:15.286 --> 02:02:18.472
In these cases, you
can never be sure.

02:02:32.262 --> 02:02:34.863
I put the perfumes by her bed.

02:02:36.933 --> 02:02:38.408
Excuse me.

02:02:38.518 --> 02:02:41.703
- Did you test them all?
- Just a couple of them.

02:06:44.806 --> 02:06:47.032
If you can smell the perfume,

02:06:48.685 --> 02:06:51.078
squeeze my hand, Céline.
