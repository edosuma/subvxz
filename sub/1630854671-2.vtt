00:03.410 --> 00:04.930
We robbed our boss, Al.

00:04.970 --> 00:07.410
£50,000 in our bank account.

00:07.450 --> 00:10.330
Well, it's bitcoin so it's
an offline digital wallet.

00:10.370 --> 00:12.410
It's amazing-
that's what's gonna give us a baby.

00:12.450 --> 00:14.250
Does he know the money's missing?
No.Great.

00:14.290 --> 00:16.490
Then why do you have that
"I came too quickly" expression?

00:16.530 --> 00:18.090
Alfie, we need money.

00:18.130 --> 00:20.370
We don't just have money
lying around.

00:20.410 --> 00:22.410
1.2 million.

00:23.930 --> 00:27.610
The reason for this was for IVF,
not for bloody Prada handbags!

00:27.650 --> 00:30.370
We might as well wear a sign saying,
"Oh hey Alfie, how you doing?

00:30.410 --> 00:33.010
By the way,
I just robbed your company."

We are fucked.

00:55.130 --> 00:56.730
Thank you so much for coming.

00:56.770 --> 00:58.530
I don't think I could
handled this without you.

00:58.570 --> 01:00.490
To be clear,
this does not mean we've made up.

01:00.530 --> 01:02.570
I would settle for just
not going to prison, right now.

01:02.610 --> 01:04.730
OK, so our story is,
we came to take Alfie to work,

01:04.770 --> 01:06.330
you were worried
he wouldn't wake up.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.690
OK. What if he heard everything?
We might have to kill him.

01:08.730 --> 01:10.930
(LAUGHS) What?

01:12.290 --> 01:15.210
Hi Alfie, w-we just came to... Um...

coming to take you to work,

01:25.050 --> 01:27.130
cause I worried
you wouldn't wake up.

01:29.930 --> 01:31.490
You OK, mate?

01:31.530 --> 01:33.890

01:40.170 --> 01:43.370
You were the worst
wing man I've ever had.

01:45.290 --> 01:46.650
S-Sorry, what?

01:46.690 --> 01:49.250
I read somewhere, if you take
an ugly mate out with you,

01:49.290 --> 01:51.730
he makes you look better
and helps you pull.

01:51.770 --> 01:54.050
Turns out your husband...

01:54.090 --> 01:56.410
he's a walking vagina repellent.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.850
I know. What?

01:57.890 --> 02:01.810
Right. (STUTTERS) So you
didn't overhear any kind of...

02:01.850 --> 02:03.890
Deacon said he had a wonderful time.

02:03.930 --> 02:05.890
Oh yes, I did, yeah.
I had a wo-

02:05.930 --> 02:07.890
It was a magical night. Thank you.

02:07.930 --> 02:11.650
Well, unless you want your wife
to see what a real cock looks like,

02:11.690 --> 02:14.010
I suggest you piss off
and let me get dressed.

02:14.050 --> 02:17.950
Yeah, sure. Absolutely,
I don't want her to see that.
Thanks Alfie, cheers mate.

02:18.050 --> 02:20.290
Your results so far are encouraging.

02:20.330 --> 02:21.770
How have you been on the hormones?

02:21.810 --> 02:24.730
Fine. I cried at a pigeon.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.370
Well, I thought he was
mourning his friend,

02:27.410 --> 02:30.250
but he was eating him off the road.
But otherwise fine.

02:30.290 --> 02:32.970
That's understandable.
Your body is going through a lot,

02:33.010 --> 02:35.890
so you need to be understanding
of any mood swings.

02:35.930 --> 02:39.010
What, hers or mine? (LAUGHS)

02:39.050 --> 02:41.130
(CLEARS THROAT)
It was... It was just a joke.

02:41.170 --> 02:42.850
Yeah. Is there
anything else, doctor?

02:42.890 --> 02:45.450
If you could just check in
with reception to settle up.

02:45.490 --> 02:47.250
W-We have to pay now?

02:47.290 --> 02:50.170
Just the first instalment.
Is... that a problem?

02:50.210 --> 02:52.010
No. no, that's not.
No, no it's fine.

02:52.050 --> 02:53.610
Thank you so much for your time.

How much have we got left
on the credit card after
you went all Kardashian?

02:56.610 --> 02:59.730
Why can't we use the shit ton
of money we just stole?

Oh yeah, OK, we can.
We'll do that, yeah.

OK, absolutely. Hello.
I hope everything went well.

cash or card?

if you accept Bitcoin.

to sort some bits out here.

I'm gonna level with you.
We are in a tight spot, Deacon.

Really, w-what do you mean?
Well, obviously, over the years

03:39.010 --> 03:40.930
we haven't always
played by the rules exactly.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.010
Sorry, why do you keep saying "we?"

03:43.050 --> 03:45.250
It's on all the accounts
that are run by you.

them little tricks we played,

at 500 quid a litre.

What, so how much is it then?
£5 a litre!

It's not liquid fucking gold.

03:54.330 --> 03:56.610
But it's alright,
I've been through this before.

03:56.650 --> 03:58.170
It's sorted.

dodgy dealings on just one laptop.

you don't give it to them.

about that laptop.

it's... it's at home.

the thing, do you know what I mean.

you've been searching

cause I wanted to make my
workspace sort of, more efficient.

of the meeting room.

but don't try to delete anything.

how to delete files. I mean...

How do you know I don't have a plan?

the fucking obvious, but alright.

Well, it's in my office drawer.

drawer, but I think it's broken.

wanna get caught with it on me.

I will sort it.

07:06.330 --> 07:08.250
It's really nice of you
to let us join you guys.

07:08.290 --> 07:11.410
No worries. It's nice to all have
a proper dinner together.

07:11.450 --> 07:12.770
How come you've got so much food?

07:12.810 --> 07:14.690
I always buy the 20 piece
mega bucket.

07:14.730 --> 07:17.330
It works out less than
40p a piece of chicken.

07:17.370 --> 07:20.090
So, even when you chuck
half the chicken away,

07:20.130 --> 07:23.010
it still works out cheaper
than two value meals.

07:23.050 --> 07:24.250
Wow.

07:24.290 --> 07:26.730
Plus you get the extra bonus
of sort of attracting all the rats

07:26.770 --> 07:28.970
and foxes to your bins
as well, which is good.

07:29.010 --> 07:30.890
Yeah, yeah. I like foxes, too.

Oh no, it's cool.

Just a little bit of this,
a little bit of that.

You know, drop off a car,
pick it up. It's just business.

07:54.890 --> 07:57.090
It's quite a long job title,
isn't it?

07:57.130 --> 07:59.930
Esme, you are so bright,
you could do anything.

07:59.970 --> 08:03.010
You need to get a proper
stable job with prospects.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.290
You should be aiming so high.

08:05.330 --> 08:07.090
To be fair though,

08:07.130 --> 08:09.010
the stolen car game,
it's pretty solid.

08:09.050 --> 08:12.330
My boss said it's the oldest game
in the book so, you know.

08:12.370 --> 08:14.210
Wow, yeah that makes sense.

08:14.250 --> 08:16.170
I mean Jed, do you know what,
I really feel like

08:16.210 --> 08:18.170
you and Allison could be
best friends, you know.

08:18.210 --> 08:19.770
It feels like
you're on that wavelength.

08:19.810 --> 08:22.490
Kinda see things from the same
perspective. Yeah, yeah.

08:22.530 --> 08:24.570
Don't you think, Allison?

08:26.650 --> 08:30.010
Al, I was just thinking about our...
our little money laundering issue.

08:30.050 --> 08:32.370
The one you said you'd deal with
and that's all in hand.

08:32.410 --> 08:34.010
Yeah, that one. Erm...

08:34.050 --> 08:35.970
But look, I might have
had a bit of an idea.

08:36.010 --> 08:38.530
Can I stop you there, Deacon.
Does your idea have anything to do

08:38.570 --> 08:41.420
with the waste of skin cells
that is my sisters boyfriend?

08:42.170 --> 08:44.050
Do you know what,
I-I'll explain it tomorrow.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.210
It's quite complicated.
It's sort of algorithms...

08:46.250 --> 08:48.770

..it's quite Bitcoiny.

he's a really great guy.

I am agreeing with you.

find a job on your own.

Be independent.
Make your own decisions.

one who's got nothing going for him.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.410
Morning. Morning.

09:32.450 --> 09:34.570
Have you guys got
a towel or anything?

09:36.490 --> 09:39.330
(FRIDGE CLOSES)
OK, not nothing.

09:44.810 --> 09:47.050
Look, I told you I'd sort it,
and I have sorted it.

09:47.090 --> 09:49.930
My Uncle Kethan is incredibly
well connected, so all good.

09:49.970 --> 09:52.490
YOU have family
who's well connected,

09:52.530 --> 09:54.890
like criminally well connected?

09:54.930 --> 09:56.410
Yes. What's so weird about that?

09:56.450 --> 09:58.890
Alright, to be honest, I just
really need this to work out.

09:58.930 --> 10:01.570
I don't think I can handle it
if I have to stop the IVF course.

10:01.610 --> 10:04.250
No, I know.
Thanks for piling on the pressure.

10:04.290 --> 10:06.650
It'll be fine, alright. He's family.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.570
He even helped my mum
sort out her passport.

10:08.610 --> 10:11.170
Well kind of, but...
It'll be fine, right.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.290
If you can't trust family
who can you trust?

10:13.330 --> 10:14.930
Right.

10:14.970 --> 10:16.650
Mr Kethan will see you now.

Come in.

10:29.810 --> 10:32.570
(LAUGHS) Deacon, hello.

10:32.610 --> 10:35.090
Hi Uncle, thank you
so much f-f-for seeing us.

10:35.130 --> 10:37.610
(DOOR CLOSES)
And you must be Allison.

10:37.650 --> 10:38.850
Hi, great to meet you.

10:38.890 --> 10:41.010
Firstly, can I just say, wow.

10:41.050 --> 10:44.370
Ahh. You look like a movie star.
Thank you.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.130
She's a dead ringer
for Naomi Harris, innit?

10:46.170 --> 10:49.570
(LAUGHS) I don't think so.
You mean Naomi Watson?

10:50.410 --> 10:52.010
No.

10:53.010 --> 10:55.930
I-I get Naomi Harris all the time.
Of course you do.

10:55.970 --> 10:59.010
So, how can your
good old Uncle Kethan

10:59.050 --> 11:00.570
help you two love birds?

11:00.610 --> 11:02.730
Well it's actually
a bit of a long story.

11:02.770 --> 11:04.250
Make it shorter.

11:04.290 --> 11:08.730
Oh right, OK. Well,
we have come into a bit of money.

11:08.770 --> 11:09.890
£50,000.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.890
Ooh! Congratulations.

11:11.930 --> 11:14.210
Yeah. But it's on a
memory stick in Bitcoin.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.250
Which Deacon didn't realise
would be completely

11:16.290 --> 11:17.850
and utterly useless to us.

11:17.890 --> 11:19.650
Yes, thank you very much
for that, Allison.

11:19.690 --> 11:23.570
But basically the situation is,
is that in it's current state

11:23.610 --> 11:25.650
it's kind of tainted, because
(CLEARS THROAT)

11:25.690 --> 11:29.010
the-the manner in which
it was a-a-acquired, and obviously-

11:29.050 --> 11:32.090
For God's sake.
So we stole 50 grand to pay for IVF,

11:32.130 --> 11:34.410
and I'm to my eyeballs in hormones.

11:34.450 --> 11:36.810
But now we may not be able
to pay for the IVF course,

11:36.850 --> 11:40.530
'cause we don't know how to get the
money safely from whatever that is,

11:40.570 --> 11:42.690
into our account.
We just really need you to help us,

11:42.730 --> 11:45.330
because, otherwise
you're gonna see Naomi Harris

11:45.370 --> 11:48.450
have a full on breakdown in front
of this tiger in your office.

11:48.490 --> 11:51.490
Hey, that's not necessary.
That's not necessary.

11:51.530 --> 11:53.970
I can clean the money.

11:54.010 --> 11:57.170
Oh, my God. Um, thank you so much.

11:57.210 --> 11:59.170
(SIGHS) How's your mother?

11:59.210 --> 12:01.850
What?
(LAUGHS) How's your mother?

12:01.890 --> 12:03.690
Oh yeah, she's fine, yeah.

12:03.730 --> 12:05.530
She still got that nose piercing?

12:07.010 --> 12:08.770
Um... Yeah.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.250
(EXHALES)

12:15.490 --> 12:17.490
(CLEARS THROAT)

12:19.330 --> 12:22.570
As it's you, I can do it for 5%.

12:22.610 --> 12:24.770
Just leave me with the memory stick,

12:24.810 --> 12:26.770
and also give me
your account number,

12:26.810 --> 12:29.370
and I'll send it in, what,
5K instalments.

12:29.410 --> 12:31.490
That's-That's great.
Thank you so much.

12:31.530 --> 12:34.290
If anyone asks, you just have
a rich uncle who is very generous.

12:34.330 --> 12:36.090
OK, great, thank you.
Just one thing,

12:36.130 --> 12:38.370
we do need the first instalment
tomorrow, if possible.

12:38.410 --> 12:39.970
Of course. Leave it with me.

12:40.010 --> 12:44.050
Great, thank you.
Look, w-we-we appreciate this.

12:44.090 --> 12:45.890
You know, I'm actually impressed.

12:45.930 --> 12:48.410
You can turn the amazement down
in your voice a bit if you like.

12:48.450 --> 12:50.290
No, Deacon, well done.

12:50.330 --> 12:52.610
Someone deserves a special
treat when we get home.

12:52.650 --> 12:54.170
Hold on, are we talking about sex?

12:54.210 --> 12:55.970
Oreos. Double stuffed.

12:56.010 --> 12:57.570
While having sex? No.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.730
OK, well I accept,
but I do have to actually,

12:59.770 --> 13:02.450
I've just remembered I've got
to speak to my Uncle Kethan-

13:02.490 --> 13:04.170
I need to pass on
a message from my mum.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.530
I'll be out very, very quickly.

13:05.570 --> 13:07.850
Maybe like, you know,
buy some Oreos.

13:10.690 --> 13:13.330
Kethan, I-
This is more than 50,000.

13:13.370 --> 13:16.290
Yeah, I was just coming back to say.
Well, why didn't you tell me?

13:16.330 --> 13:19.890
Well it's possible, and by possible
I mean absolutely certain,

13:19.930 --> 13:22.250
that Allison does not know.

13:22.290 --> 13:24.690
(WHEEZES WITH LAUGHTER)

13:34.450 --> 13:37.290
I'm taking...
I'm taking ten percent.

13:37.330 --> 13:38.930
Look fine, just please help me.

13:38.970 --> 13:41.370
A-And please do not say
anything to Allison.

13:41.410 --> 13:43.770
And dinner with your mum
would be nice. (LAUGHS)

13:43.810 --> 13:45.370
You're joking right?

13:45.410 --> 13:47.890
Of course.
(BOTH LAUGH)

13:49.370 --> 13:51.290
But ask her.
Yeah, OK.

13:53.640 --> 13:56.080
Just out of curiosity,
how long does it normally take

13:56.120 --> 13:57.560
for a bank transfer to show up?

13:57.600 --> 13:59.720
Kethan hasn't paid
the first instalment?

13:59.760 --> 14:00.960
Not yet, no.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.600
I know he's your uncle,
but how well do you know Kethan?

14:03.640 --> 14:05.000
Well.
OK.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.080
Well, you know, quite well.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.480
'Cause now he has all our money.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.000
Yes.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.760
(SIGHS)

14:23.800 --> 14:27.200
Well, that's fucking depressing.
Jesus, Alfie.

14:27.240 --> 14:31.320
Now listen, we need to have
a really serious talk.Right.

14:31.360 --> 14:34.120
We're both really worried that you
haven't handed in your laptop.

14:34.160 --> 14:37.000
You both are?
I thought I made it very clear

14:37.040 --> 14:39.520
how seriously
I was taking this audit.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.800
Now, you need to hand
your laptop in straight away.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.560
Well, it's... it's gone.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.520
That feels a bit suspicious.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.360
Yeah, very suspicious.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.720
Where's it gone to?

14:49.760 --> 14:52.600
Well, I-I've lost it. I can't
really see it ever turning up.

14:52.640 --> 14:56.800
Didn't I tell you. Deacon can be
as useless as unwashed wank blanket.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.680
Can't you, Deacon?

14:58.720 --> 15:02.080
Yes, I can be as useless
as an unwashed wank blanket.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.800
I have to warn you,

15:03.840 --> 15:07.360
this could have
very serious consequences.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.360
Very serious indeed.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.160
I'm sorry you
had to see this. Janine.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.000
You make me sick.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.960
Thank you so much
for joining, Sally.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.120
Always happy to help.
(LAUGHS)

15:24.160 --> 15:27.200
(SIGHS) For fuck's sake.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.760
E-E-Excuse me, sorry.
Yeah.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.880
How can I help?
Yeah, I need to speak to Kethan.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.560
Who?

15:37.600 --> 15:39.960
Um, Kethan.
Kethan who?

15:40.000 --> 15:43.240
Sorry, what do you mean?
Kethan. Y-Your boss, Kethan.

15:43.280 --> 15:46.240
I spoke to him here yesterday.
I spoke to YOU here yesterday.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.240
I'm sorry, I don't know
who you're talking about.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.640
Have you got the right Taj Mahal?

15:49.680 --> 15:52.720
There is another Taj
in Reading town centre. Just...

16:00.560 --> 16:02.160
From when?

16:04.520 --> 16:06.160
Fuck this.

Esme, I'm not waiting outside

16:11.920 --> 16:14.040

16:14.080 --> 16:16.400
Can you not read the sign?

16:16.440 --> 16:17.720
What is going on?

16:17.760 --> 16:19.920
I think it's called
"getting my life together."

16:19.960 --> 16:22.400
What are you talking about?
You are fist-fucking a watermelon.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.320
Have you not heard of ASMR?
It's for my only fans page.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.040
Oh, my God,
you've actually lost your mind.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.400
Can I remind you that you are
the one that said I needed

16:30.440 --> 16:32.680
to start making my own money?
No, I said you need to start

16:32.720 --> 16:35.200
making smart decisions.
I would argue that fucking fruit

16:35.240 --> 16:37.080
in your underwear
is not a smart decision.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.240
Well, I earned £350 today.
(DOOR OPENS)

16:39.280 --> 16:42.040
Jesus, really? Yeah.
Oh my God, well maybe keep doing it.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.520
Allison can I speak to you
in the, um...

16:44.560 --> 16:46.160
b-bedroom, please.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.280
Mm-hmm.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.520
Hey.
Hey.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.880
Start again.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.880
OK, what's the problem?

16:56.920 --> 16:58.640
You're making that face
like on our date when-

16:58.680 --> 17:00.080
Shat myself. Yes I know.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.640
Look, I may need to come clean
about a couple of things, OK?

17:02.680 --> 17:06.000
Go on. Well, it's possible
I don't know Uncle Kethan

17:06.040 --> 17:07.760
quite as well as I suggested,

17:07.800 --> 17:11.800
and I'm starting to worry
a little bit that he may have...

17:11.840 --> 17:14.120
taken the money.
No, he's your uncle.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.920
Asian uncle.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.600
Wh-What does "Asian Uncle" mean?

17:17.640 --> 17:20.160
"Uncle" in Asian culture
is more like a term of respect.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.800
It's not actually an Uncle.

17:21.840 --> 17:25.360
It's sort of any random brown man.
Like, I've got hundreds of them.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.600
So, he's NOT your uncle?
No, and he's not answering my calls.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.960
He's not paid the money in,
and he's also refusing to see me.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.880
So hold on, you gave all our money
to a complete stranger?

17:35.920 --> 17:38.800
He's not a complete stranger.
He did date my mum once, to be fair.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.640
But yes, he is a complete stranger
to me, but not to my mum.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.680
He was quite handsy, actually.
Oh, my God.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.320
It was all for nothing.
I can't handle this.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.520
The synthetic hormones
coursing through my veins

17:48.560 --> 17:50.320

this new development.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, OK.
Look, it's not all for nothing.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.880
I will sort it, OK.
I-I shouldn't have come back.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.720
I've got it covered.
You can get the laptop

17:56.760 --> 17:58.640
while I sort out Kethan... OK.
..then we can

17:58.680 --> 18:01.600
get into bed and have a nice cry
watching Toy Story 3, OK?

18:01.640 --> 18:03.560
Love you. Love you so much.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.240

18:51.520 --> 18:52.560
No.
Now.

Once again I don't know
who you're talking about.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.360
Sure about that, are you?
Yes.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.680
Right. Cause it's just...

(EXHALES DRAMATICALLY)

19:00.680 --> 19:02.160

feeling a bit funny
in my stomach, you know.

I'm trying to figure out what it is.
I don't...

19:05.920 --> 19:08.120
I don't know what it is.
I feel really, like...

19:08.160 --> 19:12.960
Jeez, it feels like a cement mixer
of just pure, unadulterated shit.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.200
And I think it might be
because I've been eating here.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.280
I hope you're enjoying your food,
cause you're gonna be

19:17.320 --> 19:19.640
seeing it again very soon.Sorry.
Makes you sick as shit.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.440
And it doesn't matter
which curry you have,

19:21.480 --> 19:23.280
because they use
the same sauce in every one.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.840
I've had that one, by the way.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.120
Made me shit non-stop for days.
He's only joking.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.800
That'll come straight through you.
Stop, please.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.520
I was shitting so much you could've
used me as a fountain.

19:32.560 --> 19:35.120
That's enough. Do you know what,
I suggest all of you here

19:35.160 --> 19:37.520
just go into your calendars,
write off the next month,

19:37.560 --> 19:40.320

cause that's what feels like-

19:42.760 --> 19:44.800
Deacon. My boy.

19:44.840 --> 19:47.240
Oh, hello, Kethan.
Why did no-one tell me he was here.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.160
(LAUGHS, CLEARS THROAT)

19:49.200 --> 19:51.160
Sorry for the commotion, everyone.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.760
Um... Dinner's on the house.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.360
(LAUGHS)

19:57.400 --> 19:59.520
Deacon, what's this all about?

19:59.560 --> 20:02.960
Right, well it's actually about
this whole money instalment thing.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.440
I said the money would come today.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.400
Right. That's exactly the problem,
it hasn't.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.680
Check your bank.
I only checked it not that long ago.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.080
Yeah, OK.
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:12.320 --> 20:13.600
Hold on, one sec.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.200
Oh, right yeah, it is actually...

20:17.240 --> 20:19.640
I paid the first instalment
because I'm a man of my word.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.280
Right.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.320
Looks like you made a bit of an arse
of yourself tonight, innit?

20:24.360 --> 20:26.440
Yeah, I-I'm sorry about that.
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:26.480 --> 20:29.280
So, how about that number?

20:29.320 --> 20:31.480
What, my-my mum's number?

20:32.640 --> 20:36.000
Yeah, I can't see any...
problems with that.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.000
See how this works?

20:38.040 --> 20:40.760
I help you, you help me.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.640
And long may it continue.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.600
That's what family's
all about, am I right?

20:44.640 --> 20:46.840
Yeah, you're right, yeah.
Thanks, Uncle Kethan.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.800
OK. (LAUGHS)

20:48.840 --> 20:51.720
Oh, and pull a stunt
like this again yeah,

20:51.760 --> 20:53.920
and I'll chop your dick off.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.160
(BOTH LAUGH)

21:02.320 --> 21:05.220
Do you fucking work for me?
Oh, yeah. No, no, sorry, Uncle.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.560
Yeah Mum, it's me. You're gonna
need to change your phone number.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.840
Hey, how'd it go?
Well, I sorted it.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.280
We've got five grand in our account
so, you'll be fine

21:20.320 --> 21:23.160
for the appointment tomorrow.
Wow, thank you!

21:23.200 --> 21:25.560
You're welcome.
I have some more good news.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.280
I managed to destroy the laptop.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.640
By "destroy it" you mean...
(GRUNTS)

21:30.720 --> 21:33.800
I took the last few months of stress
and hormone injections out on it.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.880
God, that sounds horribly
violent, but thank you.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.880
I think everything's gonna be OK.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.440
I hope so. (ALARM RINGS)Oh!

21:40.480 --> 21:43.400
It's my trigger shot.
(SIGHS) I'm too tired.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.920
Can you stick it in
and hopefully I won't feel it.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.920
A bit like my last birthday.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.960
