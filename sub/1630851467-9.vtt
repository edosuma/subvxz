[Episode 24: Sae-yi Doesn't Know Number 4]

00:59.840 --> 01:01.840
I told you
to just buy some wine glasses...

01:04.360 --> 01:06.600
-Yu-mi.
-I ran into her in the elevator.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.560
She didn't know I had moved
into this building.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.680
Thanks for this.

01:12.480 --> 01:13.480
No problem.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.600
Thank you.

01:17.760 --> 01:19.320
See you, Yu-mi.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.960
Bye.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.280
Right, Yu-mi.

01:26.440 --> 01:29.039
I'm going to throw a housewarming party.
You should come.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.840
Sure, please invite me. I'll be there.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.960
Okay, then have a good night.

01:38.680 --> 01:39.720
Good night.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.160
Yu-mi.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.680
What are you doing here?
You said you were going to bed.

01:50.479 --> 01:51.479
Come in.

01:56.120 --> 01:58.360
Come on in, Yu-mi.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.480
Come on in.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.000
Yu-mi.

02:23.880 --> 02:27.320
Sae-yi has moved to this building?

02:28.480 --> 02:30.000
Oh, about that.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.200
Because we've been working late
and it's hard to commute.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.720
I guess that's why she moved.

02:34.800 --> 02:35.960
I didn't know either.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.880
You didn't know, but she came to
borrow wine glasses at this hour?

02:38.960 --> 02:40.360
I found out later.

02:40.600 --> 02:41.640
When?

02:41.720 --> 02:44.120
A few days after she moved.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.040
She said she moved here last month.

02:47.480 --> 02:50.720
You didn't tell me until now
even though you knew all along?

02:53.560 --> 02:54.680
I forgot.

02:55.480 --> 02:56.960
I must've forgotten.

02:57.079 --> 02:59.079
Does it matter that Sae-yi moved?

03:02.360 --> 03:04.720
Come in first.
It's nice to see you unexpectedly.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.280
Don't try to gloss over it again.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.440
You forgot?

03:10.560 --> 03:12.360
Don't be ridiculous.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.720
I wanted to see you
at your house last week,

03:14.800 --> 03:16.640
but you insisted on meeting outside.

03:17.040 --> 03:20.160
You were afraid I'd run into Sae-yi,
weren't you?

03:20.240 --> 03:21.760
And the week before that too.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.960
I said I'd stop by
because I was in the area,

03:24.320 --> 03:25.760
but you said you'd come out.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.800
Are you still saying you forgot?

03:28.360 --> 03:29.960
You deceived me on purpose.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.480
-I didn't deceive...
-You did!

03:33.200 --> 03:34.520
Why did you lie?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.560
Because you were going to do this.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.040
What?

03:51.120 --> 03:53.240
You get sensitive
when we talk about Sae-yi.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.640
I didn't tell you because that bugged me.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.600
I knew you'd act like this.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.760
I never told her to move here.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.800
I can't tell her not to move here either.

04:02.880 --> 04:04.280
That's up to her.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.400
It's not like I can kick her out.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.680
And it'd make you sensitive.

04:16.360 --> 04:17.920
Did you just say sensitive?

04:18.120 --> 04:19.959
Because Yu-mi's sensitive?

04:20.040 --> 04:21.600
Seriously, that jerk!

04:21.680 --> 04:23.600
Seriously, how despicable!

04:23.720 --> 04:25.400
I can't take that anymore.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.800
Let's curse him.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.600
Guys. Bring the curse bomb.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.840
No. We have to torture him with facts.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.600
What? Torture him?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.040
We need Yu-mi Encyclopedia.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.560
[Yu-mi Encyclopedia]

04:42.960 --> 04:45.960
I recorded everything just in case.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.440
-Photocopy this and give it to everyone.
-Yes, sir.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.560
Extract only Sae-yi and Woong's parts.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.640
Yes, sir.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.440
It's not because Yu-mi's sensitive.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.560
We have to prove it.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.880
I found Sae-yi's weird behavior.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.720
On July 21, the famous
yuzu preserve incident.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.080
You didn't make it, did you?

05:04.480 --> 05:05.520
Oh, this?

05:07.680 --> 05:08.960
Someone gave it to me.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.680
[Woong lied.]

05:11.040 --> 05:13.360
[In the end, she confirmed
it was from Sae-yi.]

05:11.680 --> 05:12.920
[I made yuzu preserve.]

05:13.440 --> 05:16.080
The yuzu preserve I made is also here.

05:16.680 --> 05:17.880
I found one too.

05:17.960 --> 05:21.640
On August 6,
the social media incident occurred.

05:21.720 --> 05:22.920
Yes, that's the one.

05:22.840 --> 05:26.720
[Another late night.
We, Three Eagles, got this.]

05:23.200 --> 05:24.560
[Another late night.]

05:24.640 --> 05:27.600
[We, Three Eagles, got this. Goo Woong.]

05:26.800 --> 05:28.440
[Goo Woong]

05:27.680 --> 05:30.920
Why did she post that photo
on her social media?

05:31.600 --> 05:32.840
It is weird, right?

05:32.920 --> 05:34.800
Yes, her intention is impure.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.960
Why did she post it
when she knows he has a girlfriend?

05:38.400 --> 05:40.280
-What's her name?
-Seo Sae-yi.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.680
Her name sounds weird. She acts weird.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.880
She's weird. Is there anything else?

05:46.960 --> 05:47.960
I found one more.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.520
She pretended she knew
what Woong likes all the time.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.159
My. You don't like dongdongju?

05:53.440 --> 05:55.920
-Well, it's not that I don't like it.
-Dongdongju is Woong's favorite.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.520
But just so you know, Woong likes gimbap.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.200
He doesn't really like
fried tofu rice balls.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.640
I think

06:02.040 --> 06:04.800
it reached the peak on Yu-mi's birthday.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.440
The necklace. I picked it with him.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.560
He said it was for your birthday.

06:11.160 --> 06:14.040
He kept picking weird ones,
so I picked it for him.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.000
It looks good on you.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.640
The yuzu preserve.
You lied to me about it too.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.080
You even gave me a lame excuse.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.520
What about Sae-yi?

06:26.280 --> 06:28.160
Every time we meet, she tells me
what you like to eat

06:28.240 --> 06:29.560
and pretends to know you.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.120
She posts a photo without permission
as if you're dating.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.960
Acting like your girlfriend wasn't enough

06:36.720 --> 06:38.360
she even moved downstairs.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.320
She borrows stuff
so she can visit you even at this hour.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.680
It seems that wasn't her first time.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.600
I'm being sensitive?

06:51.880 --> 06:52.920
No.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.960
This is irrational, Woong.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.640
Anyone would say that it's weird.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.560
Can't you see that?

07:03.920 --> 07:05.040
The thing is,

07:07.440 --> 07:08.760
that's who she is.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.360
"That's who she is"?

07:12.440 --> 07:15.120
She's irresponsible.
She always acts as she likes.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.560
-So...
-So you just let it slide?

07:20.200 --> 07:21.600
Because you're friends?

07:22.040 --> 07:24.920
That's how she's always been like? No.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.400
You have a girlfriend now.

07:28.480 --> 07:29.840
You have me.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.200
It's different from before.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.560
Then you should've stopped her.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.080
You could've done that.

07:37.680 --> 07:41.560
But you kept lying to me instead.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.600
Yu-mi.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.240
[Emergency.]

07:56.520 --> 07:58.720
[Yu-mi is burning with rage.]

07:59.120 --> 08:02.680
I've never seen Yu-mi so mad before.
What do we do?

08:02.760 --> 08:05.600
But what has Woong done so wrong?

08:05.680 --> 08:07.880
-What?
-We've been doing our best.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.800
[Every time he was in trouble,
he changed to the bear mode.]

08:15.840 --> 08:17.440
You should've told me.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.840
[He did everything he could.]

08:20.960 --> 08:23.000
[He tried to stop her from moving.]

08:23.160 --> 08:26.080
Oh, Woong. I went to look for
a new place on my vacation.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.200
A new place? Are you moving?

08:29.280 --> 08:32.240
Yes. I'm spending too much on taxi.

08:32.559 --> 08:34.280
I'm thinking about moving closer to work.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.120
That's better.

08:36.200 --> 08:39.520
I like the building you live in now.
It's a good location.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.720
The one where I live?

08:41.799 --> 08:44.840
Yes, that was the best around here.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.400
It's too expensive. It's all bubble.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.800
You barely get sun
because it's facing north.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.160
The water pressure is too weak.
Your poo wouldn't flush down.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.960
You have to unclog it every time.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.800
Do you want to live that way? No.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.720
The water pressure is weak in your house?

08:58.120 --> 08:59.280
No way.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.120
When you flush the toilet in his house,
it's like a waterfall.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.840
His place has good water pressure.

09:11.440 --> 09:14.320
[Yet, she moved here on her own.
What can I do about it?]

09:14.400 --> 09:17.840
Right. He always stayed firm
in front of Sae-yi.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.200
This is unfair.

09:19.280 --> 09:22.240
Let's explain, so Yu-mi would understand.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.360
Let's run the algorithm.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.200
[Now Woong's algorithm will begin.]

09:30.360 --> 09:33.240
Yu-mi. Why don't you sit down
and listen...

09:33.320 --> 09:36.520
Sae-yi pretends to be your friend
and acts like your girlfriend.

09:36.960 --> 09:39.360
Why are you letting her?

09:39.640 --> 09:42.000
-I never...
-You are right now.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.320
You said I'm too careful.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.800
No, you're too careless.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.400
Both you and Sae-yi are careless

09:52.800 --> 09:54.880
and show no respect to me whatsoever.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.480
[Next step. Make Yu-mi feel...]

10:01.560 --> 10:03.960
[Make Yu-mi feel...]

10:04.040 --> 10:07.280
[-Make Yu-mi feel...]
-What's wrong with this?

10:08.280 --> 10:09.760
Look at that.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.520
-Why is everything...
-No!

10:15.400 --> 10:16.480
What's going on?

10:20.440 --> 10:21.480
This is bad.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.960
Ice Woong mode is in effect.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.560
[Everything freezes when Woong's mad.]

10:35.760 --> 10:36.960
Am I wrong?

10:38.080 --> 10:39.520
I was taking care of it

10:40.680 --> 10:42.720
without making anyone uncomfortable.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.720
By taking care of it,

10:46.720 --> 10:48.040
you kept it as a secret from me?

10:48.120 --> 10:50.040
Sae-yi's only a friend.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.360
Isn't that enough?

10:55.080 --> 10:56.960
That's not the point.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.160
Why do I have to explain every time?

10:59.520 --> 11:00.560
When she means nothing to me.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.320
What's he doing? Is he getting mad?

11:09.080 --> 11:10.240
How brazen!

11:10.320 --> 11:12.000
He should be on his knees
asking for forgiveness.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.240
How dare you get mad at her!

11:16.800 --> 11:17.880
You should apologize,

11:20.000 --> 11:21.680
not explain.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.000
I have nothing to apologize for.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.320
Nothing to apologize for?

11:30.520 --> 11:31.520
Nothing.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.160
I'm

11:39.000 --> 11:40.480
so mad at you,

11:41.720 --> 11:43.280
but you have nothing to apologize for.

11:47.680 --> 11:48.840
Okay. I get it.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.560
Bye.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.960
[Wait. Is it right for her to leave?]

11:57.280 --> 11:59.080
[Nothing was solved.]

12:04.120 --> 12:06.880
[Yu-mi left. She went out.]

12:07.000 --> 12:08.280
[No. Stop her.]

12:21.400 --> 12:22.400
[Is he coming?]

12:22.800 --> 12:24.960
[I'm sure he'll come to stop her.]

12:26.240 --> 12:28.880
No. Yu-mi's left.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.440
We need to do something.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.520
We can't.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.600
All functions

12:33.960 --> 12:35.400
are frozen.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.160
[Stop her. Please.]

13:38.960 --> 13:40.320
[How can he do this?]

13:43.640 --> 13:45.720
How can Woong do this to her?

13:46.240 --> 13:49.520
I thought he'd stop her and apologize.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.520
I've never seen Woong so cold before.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.200
He scared me a bit.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.840
He'd call her at least, right?

13:58.840 --> 14:01.240
If he does, let's forgive him for now.

14:01.320 --> 14:02.800
Then we can make sure

14:02.880 --> 14:04.200
he never does that again.

-What's that?

16:30.320 --> 16:33.320
Wait. 24 hours is too short.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.040
Can we make that 36 hours?

16:35.120 --> 16:36.920
Yes. It's normal to fight

16:37.000 --> 16:38.920
in a relationship.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.920
How about 48 hours to make it easy?

16:42.160 --> 16:44.760
Sounds good. 48 hours is better.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.480
That sounds better.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.240
-No.
-Why not?

17:52.160 --> 17:54.160
What's this? Coffee?

17:54.280 --> 17:55.680
Yes, I bought some coffee.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.800
You drink iced latte, right?

17:58.880 --> 18:00.600
Thank you so much.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.000

18:17.360 --> 18:18.440
Are you okay?

18:19.360 --> 18:21.120
-About what?
-I was worried

18:21.640 --> 18:23.680
just in case.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.960
Yu-mi seemed flustered

18:26.040 --> 18:28.280
to see me in the building last night.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.280
I didn't know you didn't tell her.

18:35.040 --> 18:36.080
Is it still not working?

18:36.160 --> 18:37.520
It's messed up.

18:37.640 --> 18:38.880
Nothing works.

18:38.960 --> 18:39.960
What's that?

18:41.200 --> 18:43.760
What's that? I didn't press it.

18:43.840 --> 18:44.840
[I know]

18:45.320 --> 18:48.200
[well about Woong.]

[so I'll take him over from now on.]

18:55.200 --> 18:56.440
-It's a bug.
-What?

18:56.520 --> 18:59.200
Sae-yi Bug got through the broken circuit.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.680
[Let me tell you
the kind of person Woong is.]

19:06.600 --> 19:07.600
You didn't

19:08.000 --> 19:09.840
have a fight with Yu-mi, did you?

19:11.440 --> 19:13.960
My. Did you really?

19:14.840 --> 19:17.640
[Number one. Woong can never hide it.]

19:21.400 --> 19:23.600
My cof... Where did my coffee go?

19:23.880 --> 19:24.920
I left it over there.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.440
Coffee is the best after relieving myself.

19:28.520 --> 19:29.720
Enjoy.

19:31.400 --> 19:34.280
[So all information is shown in his face.]

19:41.440 --> 19:42.920

19:43.000 --> 19:45.120

strong like Yu-mi.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.840
The security system must've been too lax.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.520
[And to Woong,]

19:49.600 --> 19:51.560
[he has the highest priority.]

priorities fight,]

20:01.280 --> 20:02.400
Yes.

Yes. Pardon?

20:05.600 --> 20:07.760
Wait.

20:14.120 --> 20:17.600
[Now, let's make the first priority
push the second priority out.]

20:18.000 --> 20:19.960
I'm careful

20:20.240 --> 20:22.400
to comment on others' relationships,

20:22.640 --> 20:24.760
and since I don't know
what happened between you two,

20:25.120 --> 20:26.640
I can't say it easily,

20:26.840 --> 20:29.120
but I hope it doesn't stress you so much.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.120
I feel like you're just getting stressed

20:35.200 --> 20:37.200
while you're dating. I'm worried.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.160
No matter what people say,
what's most important is you.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.040
Don't you agree?

20:49.440 --> 20:52.320
You're right. I agree with you.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.120
You become close
because you can understand them.

20:57.320 --> 21:00.520
But just because you're close, it doesn't
mean you have to understand everything.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.200
No. Woong. Come to your senses!

21:09.280 --> 21:10.880
You can't fall for that!

21:12.720 --> 21:15.320
Right. Maintaining a relationship

21:15.400 --> 21:17.880
with someone you're not compatible with
can be stressful.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.320
Even if things were great
between you and you got close,

21:21.400 --> 21:24.120
if you're not compatible,
you will never be compatible.

21:25.280 --> 21:26.400
I agree.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.640

21:31.800 --> 21:32.960

-What?

21:39.520 --> 21:41.400
I was talking about you.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.960
Your behavior makes me feel uncomfortable.

21:44.160 --> 21:47.760
There's a limit to how much I can take
just because we're close.

21:47.960 --> 21:50.520
All of your behavior is giving me stress.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.960
My behavior? What did I do?

21:53.800 --> 21:55.680
Because I moved to
the same building as you?

21:55.760 --> 21:58.760
Are you getting mad at me
because you guys fought over that?

22:00.200 --> 22:01.400
How ridiculous.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.520
I moved there because it's close
to the office. So what?

22:04.760 --> 22:07.160
Do I have to worry about things like
that when we're friends?

22:07.280 --> 22:10.600
Is that what you think?
Are you sure it's not what Yu-mi thinks?

22:11.320 --> 22:14.440
Are you talking to me as a friend
or as Yu-mi's boyfriend?

29:41.480 --> 29:44.240
Oh, no! I'm late. I'm going to go!

29:44.560 --> 29:45.560
See you tomorrow.

30:13.680 --> 30:14.680
Woong.

30:16.040 --> 30:19.760
I think I made a mistake
with what I said this morning.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.640
I didn't mean to upset you.

30:22.760 --> 30:25.680
It just seemed like you were
being misunderstood.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.200
I said what I said because I was upset.

30:31.440 --> 30:32.440
I'm sorry.

30:33.080 --> 30:36.160
It's fine. Let's stop talking about that.

30:36.240 --> 30:39.880
No. I really shouldn't have said that.

30:40.760 --> 30:43.280
I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

30:43.960 --> 30:47.320
I was a bit harsh too.
Just forget about it.

30:47.400 --> 30:50.400
You just said what needed to be said.

30:52.960 --> 30:55.480
Want to go grab some pajeon? I'm hungry.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.520
Let's eat another time.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.040
Are you going to go?

31:01.120 --> 31:03.880
Yes. I need to leave early today.

31:04.280 --> 31:08.200
[No. If he leaves now,
he's probably going to Yu-mi.]

31:09.040 --> 31:10.480
[Then we're back to square one.]

31:11.880 --> 31:14.160
[We can't go back to square one.]

31:16.080 --> 31:17.880
I'm going to get going.
I'll see you tomorrow.

31:32.760 --> 31:33.920
Woong.

31:34.520 --> 31:35.320
What is it?

31:36.240 --> 31:40.520
[Woong. We used to have
a special relationship.]

31:41.400 --> 31:44.280
[But if I were to get married,
it would be to Goo Woong.]

31:44.360 --> 31:46.480
[If I were to get married,
it would be to Goo Woong.]

31:46.560 --> 31:48.360
[If I got married,
it'd be with Goo Woong.]

31:48.440 --> 31:49.640
[I would marry Goo Woong.]

31:53.080 --> 31:54.480
I have something to tell you, Woong.

31:56.680 --> 31:57.720
I...

32:05.200 --> 32:06.360
You said you were just friends.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.640
Yu-mi. What--

32:10.720 --> 32:13.440
Hold on. Let me talk to Sae-yi first.

32:17.400 --> 32:20.480
You said you were friends,
so tell me what this is about.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.360
You said you were just friends.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.600
Yes, but Yu-mi.

32:26.680 --> 32:29.480
According to your logic,
friends can't hold one another's--

32:29.560 --> 32:30.720
No, they can't.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.440
-Then I--
-Yes, please don't.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.480
-Am I--
-Don't do any of it.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.200
-Yu-mi, can't you--
-Yes, I can't understand. Don't do it.

32:38.280 --> 32:41.560
Hold on! My gosh.
You won't let me get in a single word.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.160
What did I do for you to tell me
not to do it?

32:45.240 --> 32:47.080
All of your behavior until now.

32:48.560 --> 32:49.880
Please don't do any of it anymore.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.160
My behavior?

32:56.960 --> 32:58.320
What did I do?

32:59.440 --> 33:01.440
I have no idea

33:02.040 --> 33:03.880
what you're talking about.

33:03.960 --> 33:06.800
-You don't know what I'm talking about?
-No, I don't.

33:06.880 --> 33:09.480
-That's enough.
-I'm pretty sure you do.

33:09.560 --> 33:12.680
No, I have absolutely no idea.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.440
Your honor.

33:19.520 --> 33:22.640
She keeps saying she has no idea,
so we must make it clear to her.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.360
Listen carefully, Seo Sae-yi.

33:25.440 --> 33:27.960
I will present the verdict.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.440
I heard you had a cold.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.040
Drink some morning and night.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.520
[You gave him a gift of yuzu preserve,]

33:33.600 --> 33:35.920
[and you wrote a memo that would
confuse any guy.]

33:35.600 --> 33:36.600
[Hurry up and get better, Goo Woong.]

of Love Prevention Act.

[You posted a photo that made it seem like
you were dating on social media.]

33:47.440 --> 33:50.480
Violation of the law
on indicating relationships.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.480
[You removed a piece of string
from his shoulder.]

33:54.760 --> 33:58.600
Violation of ownership of documents
and objects such as my boyfriend's string!

33:59.000 --> 34:00.760
Dongdongju is Woong's favorite.

34:00.840 --> 34:02.600
[You intentionally said things]

34:02.680 --> 34:04.760
[-to show you know Woong better.]
-It's a must!

34:04.840 --> 34:07.920
Violation of my boyfriend's
Personal Information Protection Act.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.520
[You moved into the same building
as Woong.]

34:12.600 --> 34:13.600
What?

34:13.800 --> 34:16.120
-Here.
[-You'd go to Woong's house randomly.]

34:16.520 --> 34:19.040
Violation on the Special Act
for Restricted Access Areas.

34:20.040 --> 34:23.199
You are guilty of all of these crimes,
and this is the verdict.

34:23.280 --> 34:26.159
Yu-mi, not guilty. Seo Sae-yi, guilty.

34:26.480 --> 34:29.239
As a result, Seo Sae-yi, get lost!

34:29.719 --> 34:30.840
Darn it.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.560
Do you get it now?

34:37.880 --> 34:39.920
Do you understand the problem
with your behavior?

34:41.280 --> 34:43.080
If you and Woong are really friends,

34:43.880 --> 34:46.400
you shouldn't put your friend
in a difficult position.

34:48.239 --> 34:51.800
If you really care for your friend,
that is. Don't you agree?

34:52.719 --> 34:54.360
I would do that

34:54.960 --> 34:57.120
-if he were really my friend.
-Yu-mi, that's enough.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.520
Think about it from my perspective.

35:00.440 --> 35:02.240
-How would the other person feel?
-Yu-mi.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.040
Would you be okay with it if you were me?

35:04.120 --> 35:05.120
Yu-mi.

35:12.840 --> 35:13.920
That's enough.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.280
That's enough now.

35:37.760 --> 35:38.760

35:39.360 --> 35:41.680
[Yu-mi. Come to your senses!]

35:45.080 --> 35:47.200
What's wrong? Guys!

35:49.000 --> 35:52.040
Judge cell! Your verdict backfired!

35:52.120 --> 35:54.040
Yu-mi is at a loss for words!

35:56.040 --> 35:59.960
It's because the only thing
Yu-mi can do is let it go.

36:01.040 --> 36:01.960
What?

36:02.040 --> 36:04.720
Yu-mi doesn't want to break up with Woong.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.800
[If you don't want to break up,]

36:10.400 --> 36:13.960
[the only thing you can do is let it go

36:20.360 --> 36:22.160
Can you give me the cards you have?

36:23.200 --> 36:24.880
[Surrender no matter what.]

36:24.120 --> 36:26.280
The only card you have left
is the Surrender card, right?

36:26.960 --> 36:28.600
-Yes.
-Here.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.840
Get rid of that card and take this.

36:33.240 --> 36:35.040
[Break up.]

36:35.400 --> 36:36.600
This is...

36:36.960 --> 36:38.320
It's the Breakup card.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.560
It's a card you must always hold onto
when you're in a relationship.

36:41.920 --> 36:44.840
I've never held onto this before.

36:44.920 --> 36:48.280
Without this, Yu-mi can't behave
whichever way she likes.

36:48.760 --> 36:51.520
From now on, Yu-mi will hold onto
the Breakup card.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.280
[Break up.]

36:58.680 --> 37:01.040
[Just holding onto the Breakup card]

37:32.560 --> 37:36.640
Regardless of what you think of me,
I have to say this.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.920
You might not be able to see it,

37:42.160 --> 37:43.760
but to me, it looks like

37:47.400 --> 37:49.680
she's not a good colleague

37:50.640 --> 37:52.480
or a friend who is worth you defending.

45:04.640 --> 45:06.720
[But thanks to Lust,]

45:06.800 --> 45:08.400
[I can't totally relax.]

45:10.560 --> 45:11.800
[Late at night,]

45:12.360 --> 45:14.080
[I have to finish my most difficult task.]

45:21.560 --> 45:22.960
I'm hungry!

45:23.040 --> 45:24.760
I can't sleep

45:24.840 --> 45:26.720
because I'm hungry!

45:28.880 --> 45:30.840
-I want tteokbokki!
-Hey, Hunger!

45:30.920 --> 45:32.160
-Dakbal!
-Guys!

45:32.240 --> 45:33.240
Send me backup!

45:33.320 --> 45:34.600
I want fried chicken!

45:34.680 --> 45:36.280
Hunger!

45:43.040 --> 45:45.040
No, I shouldn't eat this late at night.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.160
I really shouldn't.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.720
[After calming down Hunger,]

45:50.800 --> 45:52.560
[I have to help Writer cell.]

45:58.840 --> 46:01.560
[The more we get to know each other,
the more we learn about our differences.]

45:59.800 --> 46:01.920
[Yu-mi started writing again]

46:02.120 --> 46:03.800
[after Writer cell came back to life.]

46:10.240 --> 46:11.320
Hey, Writer.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.160
You wrote "came" instead of "come."

46:15.120 --> 46:17.360
["I'll came now."]

46:16.600 --> 46:18.400
And you misspelled "different"

46:18.480 --> 46:20.360
in that sentence
about their personalities.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.280
Just an FYI. Take it easy.

46:27.080 --> 46:29.320
He totally ruined the mood.

46:31.280 --> 46:32.440
Darn it!

46:33.840 --> 46:35.120
[Post]

46:37.760 --> 46:38.720
[Successfully posted]

46:54.200 --> 46:55.800
[Finally, my long day is over.]

47:00.000 --> 47:01.760
Good work today, Reason.

47:01.840 --> 47:03.360
I'll put her to sleep now.

47:04.560 --> 47:06.280
Okay, thanks.

47:08.960 --> 47:12.560
♫ Sleep, sleep, my dear Yu-mi ♫

47:12.960 --> 47:17.280
♫ Sleep tight, my dear Yu-mi ♫

47:20.600 --> 47:22.680
[I'm sure I'm not the only one
who's this busy.]

47:23.280 --> 47:25.240
[Everyone's Reason cell]

47:25.560 --> 47:27.480
[has such a hectic schedule.]

47:29.160 --> 47:30.360
[Reason cells.]

47:30.840 --> 47:32.680
[Cheer up.]

47:37.120 --> 47:38.800
Hey, Reason. What's up?

47:39.280 --> 47:41.520
-Look at the sky. What's with the color?
-What?

47:41.880 --> 47:42.880
You're right.

47:43.040 --> 47:44.680
I've never seen a sky like this.

47:44.880 --> 47:47.600
What does this say
about Woong's current emotional state?

47:55.480 --> 47:57.000
Here's your coffee, Louis.

48:06.200 --> 48:07.240
Stop sighing.

48:07.320 --> 48:11.520
Everything's taking forever
without Sae-yi.

48:12.680 --> 48:15.600
What is this?
We haven't gone home for days.

48:18.520 --> 48:21.080
Sae-yi gets things done super fast,
you know.

48:21.640 --> 48:23.520
I didn't know we'd struggle this much
without her.

48:23.960 --> 48:26.200
The hiring notice is up now,
so we'll receive applications soon.

48:26.880 --> 48:28.960
I spoke to Sae-yi earlier on the phone.

48:29.520 --> 48:32.400
She's decided to join the company
that offered her the position.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.640
I think she's still mad at you though.

48:36.680 --> 48:37.800
Really?

48:37.880 --> 48:39.640
Why did you two have such a big fight?

48:39.720 --> 48:42.280
You always bicker with each other anyway.

48:43.200 --> 48:45.160
Will you never see her again?

48:46.480 --> 48:47.520
Woong.

48:47.600 --> 48:49.800
We've worked together for a long time.

48:49.880 --> 48:51.400
Are you totally fine with this?

48:53.240 --> 48:54.280
I'm not sure.

48:54.360 --> 48:55.360
What does that mean?

48:55.440 --> 48:56.560
I don't know.

49:00.120 --> 49:01.800
Is it
in "The Encyclopedia of Woong's Sky"?

49:01.880 --> 49:02.960
Let's see.

49:01.960 --> 49:04.520
[The Encyclopedia of Woong's Sky]

49:03.080 --> 49:05.320
Yellow means that he's calm.

49:04.600 --> 49:05.760
[Calm]

49:05.400 --> 49:06.400
That's not it.

49:05.840 --> 49:08.400
[Sad]

49:06.640 --> 49:08.120
-Maybe it means that he's sad.
-What?

49:09.400 --> 49:11.800
No, look. The color looks different.

49:11.880 --> 49:13.320
He's not sad.

49:11.880 --> 49:13.400
[Sad]

49:13.400 --> 49:14.400
You're right.

49:13.520 --> 49:14.680
[The Encyclopedia of Woong's Sky]

49:15.280 --> 49:17.280
Hold on. Could it be

49:17.400 --> 49:18.760
a mixture of multiple emotions?

49:18.960 --> 49:20.880
Look at this. Green means he feels bad.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.120
[Feeling bad]

49:20.960 --> 49:22.400
Orange means he's angry.

49:21.200 --> 49:22.680
[Angry]

49:22.480 --> 49:24.160
And it turns purple when he's regretful.

49:22.760 --> 49:24.200
[Regretful]

49:24.240 --> 49:25.800
If you mix the three colors,

49:25.880 --> 49:27.320
you get a poop color like that!

49:27.400 --> 49:30.440
So he feels bad, but he's angry
and regretful at the same time?

49:31.360 --> 49:32.440
That sucks.

49:36.760 --> 49:38.800
I feel bad because it is my fault.

49:40.320 --> 49:42.800
I'm angry that things ended this way,

49:44.600 --> 49:46.200
and I regret letting Sae-yi leave.

49:46.280 --> 49:47.320
That's how I feel.

49:47.400 --> 49:49.960
Can you guys try to make up in person?

49:50.400 --> 49:51.400
No.

49:52.200 --> 49:53.320
I'm afraid I can't.

49:53.480 --> 49:55.320
-Why not?
-This goes back a long way.

49:56.280 --> 49:57.960
It was bound to happen.

49:58.880 --> 50:00.160
[I'll be honest.]

50:02.080 --> 50:03.320
It's not like I don't know.

50:03.880 --> 50:05.560
I only pretended not to know.

50:05.960 --> 50:07.000
Know what?

50:10.200 --> 50:12.480
What you think of me.

50:13.720 --> 50:16.080
You think I'm a nuisance
but don't want me to date another girl.

50:17.400 --> 50:18.720
That's how you feel about me.

50:19.960 --> 50:21.040
I knew.

50:23.720 --> 50:26.120
-Woong.
-I pretended not to know about it

50:26.880 --> 50:29.440
because it didn't really matter to me,

50:30.320 --> 50:31.360
but not anymore.

50:33.080 --> 50:35.480
Don't think of me as a fallback anymore,
Sae-yi.

50:37.080 --> 50:38.720
It'll simply never happen.

50:40.760 --> 50:42.280
I need your promise

50:44.320 --> 50:46.520
for us to keep working together.

50:50.600 --> 50:52.720
Hey, Goo Woong.

50:53.080 --> 50:55.400
Are you rejecting me

50:55.840 --> 50:57.440
after thinking however you wanted

50:58.720 --> 51:00.200
and jumping to your own conclusions?

51:01.400 --> 51:02.600
I can't believe this.

51:02.680 --> 51:04.560
I'm no longer the Goo Woong
you used to know,

51:04.680 --> 51:06.560
the immature guy
you used to be able to control.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.040
So?

51:09.000 --> 51:11.080
-What?
-Are you going to marry Kim Yu-mi?

51:12.280 --> 51:13.800
I guess the two of you
promised each other.

51:14.560 --> 51:16.520
You started seeing each other
only a little while ago.

51:17.600 --> 51:18.640
How could you do this to me?

51:19.960 --> 51:21.640
We've been friends for over a decade.

51:23.400 --> 51:24.960
It's been over ten years.

51:25.800 --> 51:27.200
We've been working toward the same goal.

51:27.280 --> 51:30.040
Sae-yi, this has nothing to do with Yu-mi.

51:30.520 --> 51:32.680
This is about our relationship.

51:33.240 --> 51:35.040
Are we really friends?

51:36.480 --> 51:38.360
Was I fooling myself this whole time?

51:43.440 --> 51:46.360
I'm sure she'll do just fine there.
She's very capable, you know.

51:48.920 --> 51:50.000
Gosh.

51:50.560 --> 51:52.080
I really don't know what to do.

51:52.320 --> 51:54.360
As they say, time heals everything.

51:54.440 --> 51:56.360
Let's just get some work done now.

51:59.960 --> 52:01.560
But I'm not okay.

52:06.720 --> 52:07.800
Gosh...

52:10.840 --> 52:11.960
My gosh, it's snowing.

52:12.680 --> 52:14.200
I'll have a hard time getting home later.

52:17.880 --> 52:18.880
Ms. Kim.

52:23.040 --> 52:24.040
Kim Yu-mi.

52:27.600 --> 52:28.640
Over here.

52:35.320 --> 52:36.760
Let me buy you coffee.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.200
Thank you.

52:39.320 --> 52:43.280
By the way,
did you just call me "Kim Yu-mi"?

52:44.480 --> 52:46.640
I'm sorry.
It didn't look like you heard me earlier.

52:47.520 --> 52:48.560
What would you like?

52:51.240 --> 52:54.200
I'll get a hot latte.

52:54.920 --> 52:56.440
One hot latte, please.

52:57.600 --> 52:58.640
Thank you.

52:59.240 --> 53:01.160
You haven't been exercising lately,
have you?

53:02.320 --> 53:04.640
I'm no longer motivated
now that the competition is over.

53:04.840 --> 53:06.440
Is it over already?

53:06.520 --> 53:08.040
Yes, it ended two weeks ago.

53:08.640 --> 53:09.640
How well did you do?

53:09.960 --> 53:12.040
What matters is that
I actually participated in it.

53:13.200 --> 53:15.680
Right. I'll just guess, then.

53:16.040 --> 53:17.560
Here's your latte.

53:17.840 --> 53:18.880
Thank you.

53:19.160 --> 53:20.200
Here you go.

53:20.600 --> 53:21.600
Thank you.

53:24.920 --> 53:26.000
It's snowing.

53:27.640 --> 53:29.520
-Isn't it so nice?
-I'm worried about going home.

53:35.320 --> 53:36.320
I'm sorry.

53:37.120 --> 53:39.600
I'm not that romantic.

53:40.400 --> 53:42.520
I don't like winter.

53:43.160 --> 53:44.680
It's cold, and it snows all the time.

53:44.760 --> 53:46.640
-What about Christmas?
-Christmas?

53:47.840 --> 53:49.360
Do you have any plans for Christmas?

53:51.480 --> 53:52.560
I don't know yet.

53:59.160 --> 54:02.080
My boyfriend is busy,
so I won't know until the last minute.

54:02.560 --> 54:03.560
Me too.

54:03.640 --> 54:05.920
I can't plan anything because
of my girlfriend's hectic schedule.

54:06.960 --> 54:10.880
Right, I tried making the tartar sauce
based on that recipe you gave me.

54:10.960 --> 54:11.960
Really?

54:12.720 --> 54:14.880
It tasted better
than the store-bought ones.

54:15.200 --> 54:17.560
Right? I developed that recipe.

54:17.640 --> 54:19.440
I'm good at making sauces.

54:20.040 --> 54:22.400
That means you're a skilled cook.

54:22.480 --> 54:25.640
No, I'm not. I'm just very interested
in food and cooking.

54:25.960 --> 54:27.640
And I like checking out good restaurants.

54:28.680 --> 54:30.720
You go ahead. I have to pick something up.

54:30.800 --> 54:31.840
Sure.

54:34.040 --> 54:35.120
Oh, right.

54:35.960 --> 54:38.480
-Yes?
-I wanted to ask you something.

54:39.440 --> 54:40.800
Sure, what is it?

54:43.520 --> 54:44.920
I'll ask you another time.

54:55.320 --> 54:56.320
Yu-mi.

54:56.960 --> 54:57.960
Woong!

54:59.680 --> 55:00.720
Did I keep you waiting long?

55:00.800 --> 55:03.760
No. But it's already so cold.

55:03.840 --> 55:05.120
My hands are cold.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.640
-Your hands?
-Yes.

55:08.080 --> 55:09.160
If your hands are cold...

55:11.680 --> 55:14.800
Hey, stop it.
There are so many people here.

55:19.520 --> 55:21.840
The right hand and the left hand, docking.

55:25.480 --> 55:26.480
Completed.

55:28.400 --> 55:31.160
There. That will keep your hands warm.

55:31.960 --> 55:32.960
Great idea, right?

55:34.760 --> 55:35.760
[Goodness.]

55:35.840 --> 55:36.840
Let's go.

55:38.160 --> 55:40.560
Tell me if your feet get cold.
I'll do it for your feet too.

55:40.680 --> 55:42.320
How do you do that for the feet?

55:47.760 --> 55:50.080
Woong, you can finish this.

55:50.160 --> 55:51.200
I'm full.

55:57.640 --> 55:58.840
Hey, you look...

56:00.520 --> 56:01.560
What?

56:02.440 --> 56:03.440
My goodness.

56:04.680 --> 56:05.960
Why? What is it?

56:06.960 --> 56:08.000
You look pretty.

56:08.960 --> 56:10.920
Gosh, you scared me.

56:15.320 --> 56:18.600
If you want to compliment me,
take it up a notch.

56:19.880 --> 56:21.240
-Take it up a notch?
-Yes.

56:25.240 --> 56:26.240
You're so pretty.

56:26.920 --> 56:29.160
No, not like this.

56:36.280 --> 56:37.240
You're so pretty.

56:37.320 --> 56:39.120
Hey, that tickles!

56:39.200 --> 56:40.800
-Come on!
-Be quiet.

56:40.880 --> 56:42.520
Oh, it's starting now.

56:56.680 --> 56:57.880
What did you think of the movie?

56:58.000 --> 57:00.920
It was fun.
I wonder why it got such bad reviews.

57:01.200 --> 57:02.440
I know. I liked it too.

57:03.080 --> 57:04.320
I'll take that if you're done.

57:04.600 --> 57:05.680
No, it's okay.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.160
Give me that. I'll chuck it.

57:07.240 --> 57:08.960
It's okay. I still have some left.

57:09.560 --> 57:10.680
You do?

57:11.360 --> 57:12.960
Then can you pour some into mine?

57:13.760 --> 57:16.000
I wanted to try the milk tea.

57:16.320 --> 57:17.320
My gosh.

57:22.080 --> 57:23.240
Thank you.

57:28.040 --> 57:29.040
Do you like it?

57:29.280 --> 57:31.040
It's so good. Just what I needed.

57:31.960 --> 57:32.960
Let's go.

57:33.440 --> 57:34.600
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

57:34.680 --> 57:36.840
Who knew? I actually like milk tea.

57:36.920 --> 57:40.680
[After this December, we'll get
into the second year of our relationship.]

57:42.080 --> 57:44.840
[The butterflies are gone,]

57:45.400 --> 57:47.040
[but they've been replaced
by something else.]

57:50.400 --> 57:51.920
We have to wait at least ten minutes.

57:52.680 --> 57:53.840
Shall we sit down, then?

You don't have to do that.

Yes, it was another good date.
