Remember, team, Rafaela may be
the most obnoxious human alive,

but she's also a criminal mastermind.

Rafaela...

00:55.346 --> 00:59.059
The chickens are about to
come home to roost.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.936
I always wondered
what that expression meant.

01:02.020 --> 01:05.815
It means you're going to arrest

Yo, guys! Did you know that
Fiji is actually made up of 333 islands,

03:02.640 --> 03:04.726
but only 100 of them are inhabited?

03:04.809 --> 03:06.311
Now, that's a fun fact.

Yo, this isn't a vacation,

Rafaela's about to find out,
where there's smoke, there's fire.

03:43.681 --> 03:46.768
I'm not sure that expression
works for this scenario.

03:46.851 --> 03:51.522
[Ms. Nowhere] If you'd catch Rafaela,
I wouldn't be out of pithy one-liners.

03:52.106 --> 03:56.569
Aw, I can't believe we're in Paris!
[chuckles] The City of Brotherly Love.

Or is it Iceland? Or Greenland?

I don't know. Some kind of land.

[Cisco] Man, I think all the change
in altitude and climate are...

05:06.264 --> 05:08.433
messing with my head and giving me a cold.

05:08.516 --> 05:11.185
Getting a cold has
nothing to do with climate.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.646
-Colds are viruses. The end.
-Not true.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.357
Temperature change
weakens the immune system,

05:16.441 --> 05:21.738
constant altitude changes lead to gland
confusion and excessive mucus production.

on the perfume. [exhales]

Yeah? Well, the appetizers are over.
Time to pull out the dinner plates

06:44.862 --> 06:49.367

to eat meatloaf, and knife something!

06:49.951 --> 06:51.744
"Knife something?"

06:51.828 --> 06:55.039
How about "eat your words"
or "get your just desserts?"

06:55.123 --> 06:57.959
It was right there for you! Big softball.

06:58.042 --> 07:01.212

I'm in town for the night.

10:36.927 --> 10:41.223
Thought I'd swing by the old neighborhood
and visit my favorite nephew.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.143
Nice job with
that boxing glove to the gut.

10:44.226 --> 10:47.647
I once took a cannonball
to the old six-pack myself.

10:47.730 --> 10:51.442
Spent a month in the hospital afterwards,
but totally worth it.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.153
I can't believe how you've grown.

The last time I saw you, I was 13.
You let me drive on the freeway.

That was dangerous.

11:00.326 --> 11:04.330
And I was still in elementary school!

11:04.747 --> 11:07.458

you kind of look the same.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.251
But taller, right?

11:09.752 --> 11:10.586
Not really.

Aw...

Hi. I'm Layla.

Tuco. I've heard a lot about you.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.384
You have?

11:16.467 --> 11:20.513
Tuco's my uncle,
and a famous luchador in Mexico City.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.640
You gotta see my new routine.

11:22.723 --> 11:29.313
My luchador persona is a mythical
creature who reunites the world.

Well, first he destroys everything,
then he reunites the world.

destroy, reunite. [laughs]

Then, when my opponent is on the ground,
writhing in pain,

12:05.057 --> 12:10.563
I climb to the top of the rope and
do the Lava Leap - a backflip body slam.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.064
Want me to show you?

12:12.148 --> 12:15.359

I'm gonna pass on that one.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.278
[laughs] I want to see.

12:17.361 --> 12:20.030
[chuckles] Anyway, it's a living.

12:20.656 --> 12:23.742
I love the garage.
I guess being a spy has its perks.

12:23.826 --> 12:27.163
It's wild. We just got back
from a trip around the world

12:27.246 --> 12:30.791
chasing a crazy lady with
mind control and a weather machine.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.043
Hey, I told you that stuff was real.

12:33.127 --> 12:36.755
Let me show you our car gear.
You're gonna trip, man. [laughs]

12:36.839 --> 12:39.758
Wait, guys...
Cisco's uncle knows we're spies.

12:39.842 --> 12:40.676
-Right.
-And?

12:40.759 --> 12:44.180
You know? You're okay with it?
Don't think it's a problem?

12:44.263 --> 12:47.725
Cisco tells his uncle everything.
It's not a big deal.

12:47.808 --> 12:50.603
It's better than him
posting what he does online.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.313
Tuco's family. We trust him.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.524
I think I need to get
something in my stomach.

12:55.608 --> 12:59.028
I'm worried I'm getting sick
from the altitude and climate.

12:59.111 --> 13:04.074
And everybody knows
the remedy for gland confusion is food.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.659
They really are related.

13:05.743 --> 13:09.830
[chuckles] We can't, we're busy.
We have Ms. Nowhere's award ceremony.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.457
You could come with us.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.000
Is that such a good idea?

13:13.083 --> 13:16.086
Sure. We have a ticket
since Frostee can't make it.

13:16.170 --> 13:21.717
Ugh! I can't believe I have to miss out
on the party for "family quality time."

13:21.800 --> 13:25.137
-[rhythmic music plays]
-Moms, I'm home.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.807
Honey, it's so good to see you.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.435
Now we can finally
spend some time together.

13:31.519 --> 13:35.105
Great. What should we do?
Movie night? I'm thinking horror-comedy.

13:35.689 --> 13:36.649
[laughing]

13:36.732 --> 13:38.192
-Oh, no, no.
-Gosh, no.

13:38.609 --> 13:42.154
You're gonna spend some quality time
babysitting your sister,

13:42.238 --> 13:47.201
and we're gonna spend some quality time at
a nice restaurant with no kids bugging us.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.036
Aw...

13:49.453 --> 13:50.788
[grumbles]

13:50.871 --> 13:54.250
Hey, is Sissy still
catching things on fire?

13:54.333 --> 13:56.502
She's moved on to blowing things up.

13:56.585 --> 14:00.422
I'm sorry little man, but
I wouldn't want a ticket to go to waste.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.549
I'd love to join.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.133
-Yes!
-[laughs]

14:03.217 --> 14:04.802
It's gonna be so awesome.

[whooping, laughing]

14:12.977 --> 14:14.186
[lounge music plays]

14:14.270 --> 14:16.981
I see you got dressed up for the occasion.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.151
And you've brought an old man with you.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.152
Great.

14:22.236 --> 14:25.364
This is my uncle Tuco,
the famous luchador.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.992
Hey, congratulations on the big arrest.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.285
Oh...

14:29.368 --> 14:32.288
-You're terrible spies.
-What happened to Frostee?

14:32.371 --> 14:33.831
[Frostee] I'm down here!

14:33.914 --> 14:36.709
I got stuck babysitting my sister.

14:36.792 --> 14:42.131
Hey! This is supposed to be family time.
Now, help me comb my ponies' hair.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.091
I gotta go.

14:45.801 --> 14:46.802
Is this it?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.096
-[whirring]
-[Tony] Where is everyone?

14:49.179 --> 14:51.557
[Ms. Nowhere]
It's a top-secret spy agency.

14:51.640 --> 14:55.102
This is what our
sanctioned employee gatherings are like.

14:55.185 --> 14:58.314
[Ms. Nowhere] Each drone
represents an agent in the field.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.108
Ah, look at them! Look at them all!

15:01.191 --> 15:04.778
Here, just for me. [laughs]

15:04.862 --> 15:07.656
Well, go on.
Don't be sticks in the mud. Mingle!

15:10.367 --> 15:12.703
[munches]

15:13.412 --> 15:14.872
[gasps] No way.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.250
Check it out! Pepper spray salsa.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.668
And look at this!

15:19.752 --> 15:23.380
[electronic voice]
This marshmallow will now self-destruct.

15:26.675 --> 15:28.010
[camera clicks]

15:28.093 --> 15:32.473
It's so great to just let our hair down
and have fun, isn't it?

-[camera clicks]
-[Gary] Whoo! Yeah!

15:36.727 --> 15:38.145
[Gary] Whoo! Ha ha!

15:38.228 --> 15:40.105
[Gary laughs]

15:40.189 --> 15:42.066
These are so good.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.401
-I'll hang it in my cubicle.
-[beeping]

15:44.485 --> 15:49.114
-[exclaims] Oh...
-Sorry, Gary. We were never here.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.157
Aw...

15:50.240 --> 15:51.241
[laser crackles]

15:51.325 --> 15:56.205
Come on, it's limbo time! [laughs]

15:56.288 --> 16:01.543
Careful. That laser can cut off a head
and cauterize the wound in one go.

16:01.627 --> 16:05.089
Man, this isn't fair.
Those agents don't even have legs.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.967
After this,
we'll try to hit the cloaked piñata.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.468

16:15.307 --> 16:16.767
-[Gary] Hold on!
-[yelps]

16:16.850 --> 16:20.145
It's from the head of the agency.
Everyone, quiet down!

16:20.229 --> 16:23.107
"To agent redacted..."
[whispers] That's you.

16:23.190 --> 16:27.945
"It is our greatest redacted
to present this letter of redacted."

16:28.028 --> 16:31.073
And then the rest is blacked out,
but the end says:

16:31.156 --> 16:36.954
"The agency is happy to say, with our
most sincere gratitude, redacted."

16:37.037 --> 16:39.123
[voice breaking] It's so heartfelt.

16:45.587 --> 16:50.175
[chuckling] Oh, man. I'll never forget
the first time I met Ms. Nowhere.

16:50.259 --> 16:54.430
She tased me in the back because
she was convinced I was a double agent.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.349
Hey, is there a restroom around here?
I gotta go.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.350
I can take you.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.061
She didn't know
I was actually a triple agent

17:01.145 --> 17:03.355
acting like a double agent.

a good laugh about it... [audio distorts]

Aw, man! I can't see the video.

-[phone beeps]
-Gary, are you safe?

18:02.122 --> 18:06.460
[Gary sighs] We're okay, but someone
tried to destroy one of the floors.

18:06.543 --> 18:09.922
Thankfully, it was empty,
but the entire place is on fire.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.842
-We need to go after those guys.
-Yeah, well, we're trapped.

18:13.926 --> 18:14.802
Not all of us.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.679
-Frostee, we need your help.
-On it.

18:17.763 --> 18:20.766
They used
the agency's own security system.

the guys in the masks.

-There's a lot of footage to go through.
-[Sissy] I can help.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.409
Wait... You know how to--

18:39.493 --> 18:42.329
Please. I've been
tracking and hacking for years.

near the art center.
