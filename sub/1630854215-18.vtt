00:01.085 --> 00:02.920
<i>Previously, on</i> The Good Doctor...

00:02.920 --> 00:04.338
Going to the club or work?

00:04.338 --> 00:06.507
These early calls
need some getting used to.

00:06.507 --> 00:09.009
- Brown Retractor.
- No brown Retractor.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.720
I thought I put it on your tray.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.346
<i>Dr. Kalu is not your peer.</i>

00:12.346 --> 00:14.181
He's your employee, you're his boss.

00:14.181 --> 00:17.143
I do not plan to give Jared
special treatment.

00:17.143 --> 00:19.895
And if I see it,
it won't be good for either of you.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.897
I'm not expecting
special treatment.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.358
I don't appreciate
being treated like an intern.

00:24.358 --> 00:28.028
Dr. Andrews is judging
my performance off yours

00:28.028 --> 00:29.113
and it is not good.

00:29.113 --> 00:32.491
You come in with your fancy car,
and your old tricks

00:32.491 --> 00:35.536
and think, "Ta-da. I'm a surgeon."
But you're not.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.121
I want to prove I belong.

00:37.121 --> 00:40.416
When I checked Yara post-op,
I noticed you only used eight sutures

00:40.416 --> 00:42.877
and she had a small bleed.
You should've used ten.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.171
Dr. Glassman closed the galea and skin.

00:45.171 --> 00:48.883
- Dr. Glassman skipped two sutures?
- Guess so.

00:54.889 --> 00:57.683
At what time did you wake up
yesterday morning?

00:57.683 --> 00:59.393
The usual, 5:30. Why?

00:59.393 --> 01:01.645
At lunch, you had a Cobb salad.

01:01.645 --> 01:04.356
450 calories ingested,
assuming you kept it down?

01:04.356 --> 01:06.317
- Yes.
- Did you use a sauna,

01:06.317 --> 01:09.361
engage in rigorous exercise
and/or experience diarrhea?

01:09.361 --> 01:12.656
No, I didn't do any of those things.
What's with the questions?

01:12.656 --> 01:14.950
You made an error
in yesterday's craniotomy.

01:14.950 --> 01:18.662
I'm trying to evaluate various factors
that would negatively impact focus.

01:18.662 --> 01:19.872
I made an error?

01:19.872 --> 01:23.709
You closed with only eight sutures.
The size of the wound required ten.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.085
We need to figure out why--

01:25.085 --> 01:27.588
Why do we need to figure out why?
Two sutures.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.215
It's a blip. It's not a thing.

01:29.215 --> 01:32.802
It could be part of a troubling pattern
needing attention--

01:32.802 --> 01:36.722
Shaun, the surgery was a success, right?
The patient had a great outcome.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.224
There is no pattern.

01:39.475 --> 01:40.768
Goodbye.

01:47.274 --> 01:50.152
I'm a surgeon and I belong here.

01:50.152 --> 01:53.322
I'm a surgeon and I belong here.

01:58.661 --> 02:01.539
You are a surgeon and you belong here.

02:03.499 --> 02:05.835
I just keep imagining you in the mirror,

02:05.835 --> 02:08.629
like, you have the hair
of Tracee Ellis Ross,

02:08.629 --> 02:11.799
- and the swag of Beyoncé.
- Do not shame my self-care.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.303
Affirmations are backed by research.

02:17.221 --> 02:20.808
FMRI evidence shows a correlation
with positive changes in the brain.

02:21.851 --> 02:24.770
I've just put the finishing touches
on a surprise.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.438
Drum roll, please.

02:29.108 --> 02:31.735
Or not. Well, get your song lists ready

02:31.735 --> 02:34.947
because you are all
officially invited to

02:37.074 --> 02:40.494
"Star Karaoke. 7:00 p.m.
until question mark, question mark."

02:40.494 --> 02:43.789
It's gonna be a party when there's
double punctuation involved.

02:43.789 --> 02:46.959
Just the chance to unwind,
get to know you all better.

02:46.959 --> 02:49.837
- Sounds fun. Thanks.
- Prepare to be destroyed.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.339
My "Someone Like You" slays.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.926
Need a surgical consult
for a patient with a dislocated patella.

02:56.927 --> 02:57.761
Sorry, ER.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.057
You two are it. Room One.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.940
When did the chest pains start?

03:10.357 --> 03:14.278
I first noticed it Tuesday morning,
along with shortness of breath.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.238
Are you taking any medications?

03:16.572 --> 03:19.366
I started with one,
then switched a few times.

03:21.118 --> 03:24.413
- These are used to treat ADHD.
- And brain fog.

03:24.788 --> 03:30.586
I'm a COVID long hauler,
and I just started Guanfacine

03:30.586 --> 03:35.299
and N-acetylcysteine,
which may actually be helping, finally.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.343
When was your initial infection?

03:37.343 --> 03:41.221
Eight months ago. Just felt like
a mild flu. But then it got worse.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.724
like someone poured molasses on my brain.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.476
I've done cognitive therapy,

03:45.809 --> 03:48.270
memory exercises. Still am.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.981
Whatever I can do
to get back in the field.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.567
- Which one?
- Clover.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.612
I'm an evolutionary biologist.

03:58.447 --> 04:02.952
I have been studying how white clover
adapts to environmental changes.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.456
And I'm on indefinite leave.

04:07.456 --> 04:08.999
Please stop talking now.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.796
Bluish skin, low O2 levels,
rapid heart rate.

04:13.796 --> 04:17.216
And increasingly labored breathing.
Possible pulmonary embolism.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.385
Order a chest CTA and echo, stat.

04:19.551 --> 04:20.678
I have to go.

04:33.148 --> 04:37.277
You will need this. I sent one half
of a high-volume order to your printer.

04:37.820 --> 04:41.824
- These are Glassman's op reports?
- For the last three months.

04:41.824 --> 04:45.661
January to March. October to December
is printing in Park's and my office.

04:45.661 --> 04:48.789
So you sent reports for, like,
100 surgeries to my printer?

04:48.789 --> 04:52.751
No. 176 surgeries. 473 pages.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.170
I've emailed operations
to replace your toner.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.214
Many elements are in color.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.675
And why exactly do you need all of this?

05:00.342 --> 05:03.012
To find out if his mistake was "a blip".

05:16.942 --> 05:19.069
Second time I've dislocated my knee.

05:19.445 --> 05:22.031
First was a few months ago, I think?

05:22.031 --> 05:24.199
That was the sprained ankle.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.076
The dislocation was last year.

05:26.243 --> 05:29.830
Your MRI shows no associated damage
to bones or ligaments.

05:30.914 --> 05:34.126
She's also been complaining
about dizziness,

05:34.460 --> 05:37.504
swollen ankles, maybe menopause related.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.591
Dr. Reznick wants her
on hormone replacement therapy.

05:40.591 --> 05:43.302
Orion insisted
I get everything checked out

05:43.302 --> 05:47.014
before she leaves and moves
6,000 miles away to live alone.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.851
I'm moving to Prague next week,
for a new job.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.437
And you can visit me anytime
you want, Mom.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.897
Not with a busted knee.

05:55.064 --> 05:56.690
To move forward with HRT,

05:56.690 --> 06:00.235
I need to confirm all your medications
over the last five years.

06:02.446 --> 06:04.531
There was a purple triangle one.

06:04.531 --> 06:09.328
But they took me off that last year.
And an orange-shaped one.

06:09.328 --> 06:10.871
I'll review it with you.

06:12.414 --> 06:15.667
We need to see how your knee's moving.
Lay back, please.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.507
Go ahead with the exam, Dr. Kalu.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.885
- I thought I'd observe.
- It's a knee exam,

06:24.885 --> 06:27.179
not a multi-ligament reconstruction.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.807
You told me last time
not to assume I know everything.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.975
This is just making me do your job.

06:37.272 --> 06:40.984
That sounded like an apneic spell.
Check her tonsils.

06:40.984 --> 06:41.944
Ms. Garcia?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.326
Did I fall asleep again?

06:49.827 --> 06:50.744
Yes.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.205
Could I take a quick look in your mouth?

06:56.875 --> 06:57.918
Kissing tonsils.

06:57.918 --> 07:01.255
They're so enlarged, they're touching
and obstructing your airway,

07:01.255 --> 07:04.883
causing severe apnea.
You need a tonsillectomy right away.

07:10.139 --> 07:13.016
No pulmonary embolism,
but multiple cardiac issues,

07:13.142 --> 07:15.144
severe narrowing of the pulmonic valve,

07:15.144 --> 07:18.856
hypertrophied right ventricle
an opening between the lower chambers.

07:18.856 --> 07:22.317
This set of defects almost looks like
Tetralogy of Fallot, but--

07:22.317 --> 07:23.443
It is.

07:24.903 --> 07:28.073
She has the fourth malformation.
Overriding aorta.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.868
I've never seen Tet in an adult before.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.288
How is she still alive?

07:36.039 --> 07:39.126
Hang on a sec.
I have to write everything down now.

07:40.502 --> 07:43.005
Tet is almost always diagnosed in infancy.

07:43.005 --> 07:45.090
Doctors missed it in your case.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.009
You have a rare presentation.

07:47.009 --> 07:49.428
The right ventricle obstruction
is balanced

07:49.428 --> 07:51.680
by an increased flow
into the left ventricle.

07:51.805 --> 07:55.934
Damage from COVID disrupted the balance.
The virus may have saved your life.

07:56.059 --> 07:59.104
Very few undiagnosed Tet patients
survive past childhood.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.023
A mere 2% make it to 40.

08:01.023 --> 08:04.026
I would've just dropped dead
at some point?

08:04.026 --> 08:05.694
It's very likely.

08:05.694 --> 08:09.656
We can remove that risk
with two separate procedures.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.451
First, we'll close the extra vessels
that have formed

08:12.451 --> 08:14.369
to compensate for your heart defects.

08:14.369 --> 08:17.331
Then we'll do a surgery
to repair those defects.

08:19.625 --> 08:23.378
Is it possible the Tet is connected
to my long COVID symptoms?

08:23.378 --> 08:25.839
Could fixing my heart clear up my head--

08:27.007 --> 08:28.050
The brain?

08:29.134 --> 08:31.178
No, I'm sorry.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.481
You snagged our table.

08:43.357 --> 08:46.443
- Beat Hawks and Nuñez to it.
- You're a champion.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.446
One Splenda, half sugar
in the raw, light almond milk.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.989
Now who's the champion?

08:55.285 --> 08:58.288
- I have something for you.
- Really?

09:05.587 --> 09:08.674
An agreement acknowledging
a consensual relationship.

09:08.674 --> 09:13.553
I, Marcus Andrews, would like
to take you Dalisay Villanueva on a date.

09:13.845 --> 09:17.808
And as hospital president,
I've already signed it.

09:19.768 --> 09:20.978
This is so romantic.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.105
Give me the pen.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.614
- Dinner this weekend?
- Let me see.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.826
I'm needed on the ward. Sorry.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.703
- Lock it down later?
- Sure.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.130
- Iced coffee?
- I'm good.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.590
How about hot coffee?

09:52.968 --> 09:56.013
In honor of Daphne's
successful tonsillectomy.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.556
I got a few options.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.058
Is that a latte?

10:03.854 --> 10:05.939
It was a routine tonsillectomy.

10:06.064 --> 10:10.694
Those were unusually large tonsils.
Good thing her daughter brought her in.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.240
You think Daphne was better off
not breathing?

10:15.240 --> 10:19.661
I don't think it's a daughter's job
to make sure mom goes to the doctor.

10:21.913 --> 10:22.831
It's Daphne.

10:25.625 --> 10:29.254
- Heart rate's spiked, she's hypoxic.
- Turn up oxygen to max.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.634
Loud murmur, right ventricle
and atrium.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.763
Chronic damage from apnea could have
increased the pressure,

10:37.763 --> 10:39.431
causing right heart failure.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.309
- BP's dropping.
- Get her to the cath lab.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.358
Positioning coiling system.

10:50.192 --> 10:51.693
Two vessels left to close.

10:53.362 --> 10:54.905
Deploying the coil.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.701
Her O2 sats are dropping.

10:59.868 --> 11:04.206
Her infundibular muscle is clamping down.
She is having a Tet spell.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.002
Give phenylephrine and 100% oxygen.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.546
I have never seen one in person before.

11:12.714 --> 11:17.094
We need to move blood up to the lungs.
Give her a bolus and up the opiates.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.725
If we don't stop the spasm,
she could have permanent brain damage.

11:34.820 --> 11:38.115
The chance of a future infundibular spasm
is very high.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.577
Tet repair surgery
will be much more risky.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.838
Pressure in Daphne's lungs
is critically high,

11:52.963 --> 11:55.048
Not a routine tonsillectomy at all.

11:55.841 --> 11:57.592
Puncturing the atrial septum.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.304
Right heart is decompressing.

12:01.430 --> 12:04.558
Give nitric oxide to relax
and dilate the vasculature.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.894
Her apnea really did a number
on her pulmonary vessels.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.147
No wonder she's clumsy, forgetful.

12:10.147 --> 12:13.316
She's been sleeping
oxygen-deprived for decades.

12:13.316 --> 12:16.486
Still doesn't make her
her daughter's responsibility.

12:16.486 --> 12:19.823
Would you want Kellan to put his life
on hold to take care of you?

12:19.823 --> 12:23.743
Not his whole life, no.
But I don't think being overly-devoted

12:23.743 --> 12:26.997
is the worst quality in a kid.
Remove the catheters.

12:27.873 --> 12:31.668
I was one of six growing up.
Only girl. Mom and Dad worked a lot.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.921
So I was basically second mom
since kindergarten.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.757
I love my brothers.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.011
but there's a lot you miss out on

12:41.011 --> 12:43.763
if you're all about
caring for someone else.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.771
She's throwing a lot of PVCs.
Maybe an electrolyte issue?

12:54.691 --> 12:56.568
BP is dropping, heart rate 172.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.988
Barely getting a pulse. She's in v-tach.
Defib paddles.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.216
BP and heart rate stabilizing.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.261
Get a new chemistry, chest X-ray, EKG.

13:23.261 --> 13:26.473
We need to learn
what else is going on with her heart.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.400
Please don't disturb my materials.

13:37.776 --> 13:40.028
Which are what exactly?

13:40.028 --> 13:42.864
Dr. Glassman made
an uncharacteristic surgical error.

13:42.864 --> 13:46.660
I am determining if it was an anomaly
or part of a pattern.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.870
Glassman must be pleased about that.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.873
He is not. You are being sarcastic.

13:51.873 --> 13:55.752
Performance review is a standard practice,
benefits doctors and patients.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.755
I've noted three additional errors
from last four months.

13:58.755 --> 14:02.175
- I don't see a pattern.
- Dural tear on scar tissue,

14:02.175 --> 14:05.762
closing with a running nylon
instead of Monocryl. That a mistake?

14:05.762 --> 14:08.598
Dr. Glassman has always used
subcutaneous Monocryl.

14:08.598 --> 14:11.059
These are variations, minor missteps.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.812
Pore through four months
of any surgeon's reports

14:13.812 --> 14:16.648
- and you'll find discrepancies like this.
- No.

14:16.648 --> 14:19.150
- Yes.
- Not in mine.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.904
- That's probably true.
- Yeah.

14:22.904 --> 14:26.950
If you're not finding a pattern,
maybe it's because there isn't one.

14:29.995 --> 14:31.454
My patient is awake.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.875
Does this mean you can't do
the Tet repair?

14:36.084 --> 14:40.213
There's a medication, propranolol,
that'll significantly reduce the risk

14:40.213 --> 14:42.424
of having another spasm during surgery.

14:42.424 --> 14:46.761
But 'cause of your long COVID,
you're at risk for some rare side effects.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.680
- Are they serious?
- Yes.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.683
Not some, like nausea,
vomiting, muscle aches.

14:51.683 --> 14:54.894
But others,
such as hypoglycemia or visual--

14:54.894 --> 14:56.271
Start with propranolol.

14:56.271 --> 14:59.524
Good chance you won't experience
the side effects.

14:59.524 --> 15:02.110
But we'll need to keep a close eye on you.

15:03.278 --> 15:07.324
And are those patients ahead of her
also seniors with diabetes?

15:07.324 --> 15:10.702
Do not hang up,
or I'll head down to do this in person.

15:10.869 --> 15:12.037
I'll wait.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.331
Hey.

15:16.374 --> 15:19.836
There is a great new Portuguese spot
I read about.

15:19.836 --> 15:23.298
I can make reservations for us
Friday or Saturday at 7:00?

15:24.924 --> 15:29.054
I'm working a double both days.
Been hectic since Baker and Linh left.

15:29.054 --> 15:32.223
- Two travelers are starting Monday.
- I need staff nurses.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.516
They're highly skilled.

15:33.516 --> 15:36.895
Doesn't matter.
Travel nurses disrupt workflow,

15:36.895 --> 15:38.897
don't build long-term relationships.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.650
We don't have the resources
for permanent staff.

15:41.650 --> 15:45.695
You just hired a new full-time resident
to replace someone who left recently.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.656
That was Lim's department.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.949
Yes. Great. I'm sending her down.

15:51.076 --> 15:53.286
- Sorry. We'll talk later?
- Of course.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.541
So you're watching to see if I throw up?

15:58.541 --> 16:00.877
Or faint, seize or have muscle spasms.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.385
You know, before COVID, my brain was.

16:09.844 --> 16:13.890
I did evolutionary patterns, genetic...

16:16.768 --> 16:19.229
how genes go together.

16:20.689 --> 16:21.606
The sequence.

16:24.109 --> 16:27.612
Now my brain can't handle
the sequence of brushing my teeth.

16:29.072 --> 16:32.409
My focus, my working memory, all of the...

16:34.160 --> 16:35.286
Oh, my...

16:35.954 --> 16:38.081
The executive function.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.961
It's not always happening.

16:46.047 --> 16:49.342
Please page Dr. Wolke to monitor her
and stay until he comes.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.096
Push your hand against mine.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.349
The pattern is errors
in executive function.

16:56.349 --> 17:00.729
- I'm in the middle of something.
- Your brain cancer may have returned.

17:06.735 --> 17:09.446
- All errors tied to executive function.
- Shaun.

17:09.446 --> 17:13.199
Specifically procedural memory
in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,

17:13.199 --> 17:15.493
a common site for a recurrent glioma,

17:15.493 --> 17:18.413
which strongly suggests
your cancer has returned.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.790
My last scan came back completely clear.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.042
- I'm fine.
- Last scan was six months ago.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.963
These errors are from last four months.
You need another scan.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.591
- The evidence is very compelling.
- It's not.

17:29.591 --> 17:31.801
I perform complex surgeries,

17:31.801 --> 17:35.138
more so than any other doctor
on this staff, by the way.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.931
So the percentages would dictate

17:36.931 --> 17:41.060
that I might make more minor
and irrelevant missteps,

17:41.060 --> 17:43.146
if that's what you wanna call 'em.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.231
The rate of errors has increased.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.525
Yeah, 'cause I take on tougher cases.

17:47.525 --> 17:48.985
The ones no one else will.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.696
- No. You need another MRI, now.
- Shaun,

17:51.696 --> 17:56.993
what I need is to get back to my patient,
and you need to knock first, next time.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.292
"It's the greening of the trees."

18:05.168 --> 18:06.544
My turn.

18:08.546 --> 18:11.007
Trying to get my cognitive exercises in.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.467
What're you memorizing?

18:12.467 --> 18:15.136
It's a poem from <i>The Carrying,</i> Ada Limón.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.972
The collection is mostly about.

18:19.724 --> 18:22.769
not having the life
you thought you'd have, I guess.

18:24.479 --> 18:28.900
The one I was just reading.
it's about spring coming.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.277
"Instructions on Not Giving Up."

18:31.986 --> 18:35.073
- Sounds useful.
- Too bad I can't read it all at once.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.992
I've just graduated from haikus.

18:38.535 --> 18:41.830
Never even thought to look at a poem
before I got sick.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.416
Didn't have the patience for it,
or the time.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.961
That's basically all I read now.

18:48.753 --> 18:51.172
Started writing, too, as kind of a...

18:52.173 --> 18:53.550
creative therapy.

18:55.426 --> 18:58.555
There was a kind of poetry

18:58.555 --> 19:01.641
to the genetic variations
in white clover, too.

19:05.228 --> 19:06.896
I'd give anything to...

19:12.110 --> 19:15.238
Your blood pressure's dropping,
heart rate's climbing.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.490
- I'm dizzy.
- Checking your glucose.

19:21.536 --> 19:23.830
She's having a seizure. Crash cart now.

19:26.291 --> 19:29.460
We thought it was your heart,
but it's a kidney issue.

19:29.586 --> 19:32.338
Narrowing of your renal arteries,
which was exacerbated

19:32.338 --> 19:35.008
by the pulmonary hypertension,
causing kidney failure.

19:35.008 --> 19:38.511
- This is 'cause of my sleep apnea?
- We believe so. Yeah.

19:40.346 --> 19:44.017
Can she get a transplant?
I can do a test, see if I'm a match.

19:44.017 --> 19:47.645
Unfortunately, your other health concerns
rule out a transplant.

19:47.645 --> 19:52.066
But a renal artery bypass would allow
your kidneys to heal on their own.

19:52.233 --> 19:55.737
There's risk of complications.
Some quite serious.

19:56.404 --> 20:00.825
But in success, you could live
a full, independent life.

20:03.119 --> 20:06.581
But serious, as in I could die?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.584
Some complications can be fatal.

20:09.584 --> 20:12.003
But the risk is relatively low.

20:13.171 --> 20:15.173
Are there other options?

20:15.173 --> 20:16.883
Well, there's dialysis,

20:17.008 --> 20:20.887
but you'd need multiple sessions a week
for the rest of your life.

20:24.349 --> 20:30.229
That's less risky, but I don't think
I could handle all that on my own.

20:30.396 --> 20:35.068
Mom, if you want to choose the dialysis,
I'll stay in San Jose.

20:37.612 --> 20:38.655
I'm sorry.

20:39.739 --> 20:43.451
- I don't want to keep you.
- You have nothing to be sorry for.

20:44.160 --> 20:49.374
You know, all this time you've been sick
and struggling, and I judged you.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.834
But your new job.

20:54.337 --> 20:55.505
It's just a job.

21:03.972 --> 21:09.268
So the medication you gave me
to make my surgery safer

21:09.727 --> 21:11.980
will actually make it more risky?

21:12.438 --> 21:13.356
That's right.

21:14.107 --> 21:18.528
But without that medication, I'm much more
likely to have another Tet spell.

21:18.528 --> 21:21.698
Yes, and possibly more severe
than the last time.

21:22.615 --> 21:28.538
Brain fog, all my deficits.
could get worse?

21:30.456 --> 21:31.958
For possibly forever?

21:33.376 --> 21:34.460
Yes.

21:36.045 --> 21:40.758
But if we don't do the Tet repair,
your heart will stop at some point.

21:43.469 --> 21:46.514
I've already been through
losing my thoughts,

21:47.598 --> 21:48.808
my whole self.

21:53.187 --> 21:54.689
I can't do that again.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.404
Find another way to fix my heart.

22:19.338 --> 22:23.551
New idea. We go back to the old idea
and just do the surgery.

22:23.551 --> 22:26.471
It's a nonstarter.
We need to present a way to help her Tet

22:26.471 --> 22:27.847
without triggering her Tet.

22:27.847 --> 22:31.184
A percutaneous valve and VSD closure
could help with blood flow.

22:31.184 --> 22:34.979
That involves catheters in the heart,
which would cause the muscle to spasm.

22:34.979 --> 22:37.440
All right. It's time for some WWSMD.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.068
Whatever you and Jerome do
on your own time is--

22:40.068 --> 22:41.861
"What would Shaun Murphy do?"

23:18.064 --> 23:21.400
What about a shunt?
It would improve blood flow.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.986
Buy a few months to continue
her cognitive recovery.

23:23.986 --> 23:27.698
When she feels better about her heart,
maybe she lets us fix her heart.

23:27.698 --> 23:30.284
Her Tet would likely kill her before that.

23:30.284 --> 23:36.207
But placing a shunt won't trigger a spell,
making it something she'd actually accept.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.295
I'll take it to her.

23:42.505 --> 23:46.384
I can stay only 45 minutes.
Have to review Dr. Glassman's OR videos.

23:46.384 --> 23:49.428
- Didn't you do that?
- Not for glioma recurrence symptoms.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.806
New evidence will convince him
to get a scan.

23:51.806 --> 23:55.935
You binged months of data in one day.
You'll have a clearer head in the morning.

23:55.935 --> 23:59.021
Until then, here we are. Karaoke rager.

23:59.021 --> 24:01.732
- Yay.
- It is "yay". We have a song list.

24:01.732 --> 24:05.820
Plus Jared's our friend. He just
moved back. Celebration is in order.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.364
I will review the videos in the morning.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.784
Sounds pretty wild in there.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.954
<i>Because maybe</i>

24:14.954 --> 24:19.250
<i>You're gonna be the one that saves me</i>

24:19.584 --> 24:22.003
<i>And after all</i>

24:27.508 --> 24:28.885
I was just warming up.

24:29.260 --> 24:31.929
- Where is everyone?
- There is a lot of food.

24:32.096 --> 24:35.057
Yeah, I had it catered.
You're the first to arrive.

24:35.474 --> 24:40.771
And so far, last minute rain checks
from Morgan, Park, Asher, Danny.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.441
And Jerome.

24:45.735 --> 24:47.278
So it's just us four.

24:47.278 --> 24:50.781
Which means that all these snacks

24:50.781 --> 24:53.910
and song binders are for us.

24:54.869 --> 24:59.582
Yes. The low turnout is the perfect
opportunity to discuss symptoms.

25:00.082 --> 25:03.544
In your recent surgeries
with Dr. Glassman, do you recall observing

25:03.544 --> 25:06.547
any balance issues,
tremors or motor weakness?

25:11.427 --> 25:13.638
That sounds like the perfect option.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.557
How soon can you do the shunt procedure?

25:16.557 --> 25:19.018
I'll try to schedule it for tomorrow.

25:23.814 --> 25:26.275
I've had a strange year myself.

25:29.403 --> 25:34.283
Eleven months ago, I was attacked
and paralyzed from the waist down.

25:35.618 --> 25:38.621
I thought it was permanent.
Almost everyone did.

25:41.249 --> 25:45.503
At first, all I wanted was to walk again.

25:46.712 --> 25:50.466
I was ready to risk my life
to get back to the old me.

25:51.592 --> 25:57.056
But as time went on, I started
to appreciate my new life.

25:57.848 --> 25:58.933
My new self.

26:01.435 --> 26:05.481
I started a new relationship
that wouldn't have happened otherwise.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.986
In many ways, my life improved.

26:09.986 --> 26:13.072
You recognize you walked in
to tell me this story?

26:14.657 --> 26:18.327
I only agreed to do the surgery
once I knew my life wasn't at risk.

26:18.327 --> 26:20.663
And even then, I had doubts.

26:22.581 --> 26:26.294
I liked who I'd become.
I wanted to hold on to her.

26:30.131 --> 26:31.048
I'm not...

26:33.926 --> 26:35.219
losing my mind...

26:37.138 --> 26:38.389
all over again.

26:41.058 --> 26:44.020
You don't strike me
as someone who's lost her mind.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.665
That covers the thrombectomy.
In February, you assisted--

27:04.665 --> 27:07.710
Okay. I'm playing the pregnant lady card.

27:09.253 --> 27:11.422
- We're going, Shaun.
- Okay.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.258
Thank you. Goodbye.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.970
I should head out, too.

27:19.096 --> 27:20.014
Early morning.

27:25.519 --> 27:28.814
Maybe focus on being a first year resident

27:28.814 --> 27:32.943
before adding party planner
to your resume.

27:35.196 --> 27:37.782
The catering
may have been a bridge too far.

27:37.782 --> 27:38.824
Yeah.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.831
I bounced around growing up.

27:46.916 --> 27:50.669
at different schools, cities, countries.

27:51.921 --> 27:53.923
But wherever we were,

27:53.923 --> 27:57.927
my parents had a big house
and I knew how to throw a party.

28:01.263 --> 28:04.767
Closest I get to feeling like I fit.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.021
Old habits die hard, I guess.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.275
Fitting in takes time.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.530
But I never have, anywhere.

28:21.909 --> 28:25.496
Maybe not everyone finds their place.

28:31.127 --> 28:33.671
Daphne is getting septic. We have to go.

28:41.345 --> 28:43.097
- Morning.
- Hello.

28:46.767 --> 28:50.146
- You should not have that.
- I'm permitted 12 ounces a day.

28:50.146 --> 28:51.272
Experts agree.

28:51.272 --> 28:54.859
Yes, but that was brewed
when I woke up at 3:30 a.m.

28:56.610 --> 29:00.448
- You make it through the videos?
- Yes, and integrated the observations

29:00.448 --> 29:04.910
Doctors Kalu and Allen made last night
regarding possible glioma symptoms.

29:06.787 --> 29:08.747
I am now ready to present Dr. Glassman

29:08.747 --> 29:12.042
with the revised evidence,
which is very compelling.

29:16.338 --> 29:19.633
Thankfully, your infection
is responding to the antibiotics.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.928
The infection started
around your dialysis port,

29:22.928 --> 29:25.055
that could easily happen again.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.059
The renal artery bypass
is still an option.

29:29.059 --> 29:30.603
It's too risky.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.104
So is sepsis.

29:33.689 --> 29:36.817
Thank you, doctor,
but I'll settle for being alive.

29:37.401 --> 29:38.527
You shouldn't.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.031
You deserve more than that.

29:42.907 --> 29:45.993
I know you've had a whole life
of feeling sick and stuck

29:45.993 --> 29:48.412
and repeating the same old bad patterns.

29:48.537 --> 29:51.707
But your past does not have
to tell your future where to go.

29:55.419 --> 29:59.423
You can choose a different path,
and who you're going to be on it.

30:01.383 --> 30:03.928
And let your daughter do the same.

30:08.557 --> 30:10.559
Prague is beautiful in the spring.

30:47.846 --> 30:51.141
We've scheduled a shunt placement
for this afternoon.

30:52.059 --> 30:56.939
- And that whole speech last night?
- I stand by it, but it's your decision.

31:02.278 --> 31:05.322
I've been waiting
for the old me to come back.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.870
and that person may not exist anymore.

31:14.039 --> 31:14.915
And...

31:17.668 --> 31:19.962
maybe I should be okay with that.

31:25.175 --> 31:26.760
Do the Tet repair.

31:41.483 --> 31:43.319
Releasing the proximal clamp.

31:45.321 --> 31:47.281
What made Daphne change her mind?

31:47.573 --> 31:50.492
Dr. Allen has a way
of getting through to people.

31:54.705 --> 31:58.000
Blood flow looks obstructed.
There's a kink in the graft.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.671
We could redo it.
But most likely it happens again.

32:05.591 --> 32:08.844
We could anchor the bypass
off of the aorta instead.

32:09.887 --> 32:12.181
At that angle, less chance of a kink.

32:14.933 --> 32:15.976
That could work.

32:28.197 --> 32:30.574
- Extending the incision.
- Sternal saw.

32:35.245 --> 32:36.830
Starting the sternotomy.

32:38.666 --> 32:41.418
O2 dropped to 78. Sixty-five.

32:41.418 --> 32:43.003
She's having a Tet spell.

32:43.003 --> 32:45.714
Give her 500cc fluid bolus
and 100% oxygen,

32:46.090 --> 32:48.842
Giving a mini-bolus
to increase pulmonary flow.

32:51.762 --> 32:55.099
Oxygen sat's on 50. Forty-five.

32:55.099 --> 32:56.725
Come on, come on.

32:59.061 --> 33:01.730
Give her more oxygen and up the opiates.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.316
It has stopped registering.

33:22.251 --> 33:23.669
O2 is rising.

33:25.629 --> 33:27.381
Heart rate's stabilizing.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.678
She was in prolonged gross hypoxia.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.806
That could extend cognitive deficits.

33:37.391 --> 33:38.308
or worse.

33:38.434 --> 33:40.436
We won't know until she wakes.

33:40.561 --> 33:43.731
Let's get her on bypass
before she has another one.

33:45.774 --> 33:46.817
Okay.

33:48.068 --> 33:50.362
To a successful renal artery bypass.

33:50.362 --> 33:54.950
Cheers. Facilitated by a moving speech
from a wise and persuasive surgeon.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.953
With a great surgical save by a guy

33:57.953 --> 34:00.998
who's about to have
some life changing tacos.

34:00.998 --> 34:01.999
Okay.

34:06.128 --> 34:09.173
Oh, my God. Okay, this is amazing.

34:09.173 --> 34:12.593
- It's amazing.
- Told you. Blue. Corn. Tortilla.

34:13.218 --> 34:14.720
I could get used to this.

34:18.432 --> 34:19.975
You have some lettuce.

34:19.975 --> 34:22.936
Here. No, mirror image.

34:24.104 --> 34:25.481
- Now?
- No.

34:25.606 --> 34:26.857
No laughing.

34:26.857 --> 34:30.068
No. Right. Very serious matter.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.741
Here, let me.

34:36.700 --> 34:39.328
There. Just.

34:51.715 --> 34:53.258
We should go.

34:54.051 --> 34:55.052
Yeah.

34:55.052 --> 34:58.180
We need to get back early
for Daphne post-op.

34:58.305 --> 34:59.348
Yeah, right.

35:09.858 --> 35:13.278
The bypass went smoothly
and post-op labs look good.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.947
We expect a full recovery.

35:15.864 --> 35:17.241
How are you feeling, Mom?

35:18.951 --> 35:22.996
I am breathing.

35:23.747 --> 35:26.375
Kind of feels like
the first time in my life.

35:27.668 --> 35:31.505
The post-op swelling
from the tonsillectomy has gone down.

35:31.839 --> 35:34.299
You're finally breathing
without any obstruction.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.426
You need to stay on top
of your medications

35:36.426 --> 35:39.179
and follow-up visits,
observe some dietary guidelines.

35:39.179 --> 35:41.890
But the discharge plan lays it all out.

35:43.016 --> 35:44.518
I'll be there to help, Mom.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.605
No.

35:50.440 --> 35:51.567
You won't.

35:56.029 --> 35:58.156
You need to live your own life.

36:01.577 --> 36:04.663
But I will accept FaceTime calls.

36:06.039 --> 36:10.669
And once I recover, I'll come visit.

36:15.048 --> 36:17.718
I hear that Prague
is beautiful in the spring.

36:21.597 --> 36:23.265
It sounds like a plan.

36:34.735 --> 36:37.237
Things not go well with Glassy?

36:37.237 --> 36:39.281
He returned the files with a note

36:39.281 --> 36:42.743
saying he did not look at them
and does not intend to.

36:42.743 --> 36:44.161
I'm sorry.

36:44.161 --> 36:47.164
It probably was a mistake
to leave them for him to read.

36:47.164 --> 36:51.168
I'll reorder the files and go to
his office to review with him.

36:51.168 --> 36:53.086
He doesn't want to see them.

36:53.086 --> 36:55.505
But he doesn't know
about the new evidence.

36:55.505 --> 36:57.257
Maybe he doesn't want to know.

36:57.257 --> 37:00.427
Cancer survivors have to live
with an uncertainty--

37:00.427 --> 37:02.930
Knowing is better than not knowing.

37:05.057 --> 37:09.061
If he's not ready to look at this,
you can't force him.

37:10.520 --> 37:16.026
Maybe he's scared, Shaun.
And I think maybe you're scared, too.

37:17.653 --> 37:19.780
We're about to have a baby.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.740
You're about to be a dad.

37:22.574 --> 37:27.162
And I think you're worried about family
and Glassman is a part of that.

37:28.330 --> 37:31.625
But if you keep pushing,
you risk damaging

37:31.625 --> 37:34.878
one of the most important relationships
in your life.

37:48.558 --> 37:49.851
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:53.146 --> 37:56.858
I've been thinking, and I need a break
from our coffees.

37:56.858 --> 37:58.110
Dalisay.

37:58.235 --> 38:00.570
I don't think dinner's
a good idea, either.

38:00.570 --> 38:03.782
So we have a different point of view
about hospital business.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.118
That doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

38:06.118 --> 38:08.620
On or off the clock, I'm the same person.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.873
To me, if you don't value
what the nurses do,

38:11.873 --> 38:16.586
enough to treat us like a resource
to invest in, not a line item to be cut.

38:17.713 --> 38:19.548
How much can you care about me?

38:20.966 --> 38:24.970
And to be honest,
if that is your point of view,

38:27.431 --> 38:30.308
it undercuts the respect I have for you.

38:40.777 --> 38:46.241
Harper Louise Decrane, March 30th, 1994.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.535
And do you know why you're here?

38:49.494 --> 38:51.163
For my heart issues.

38:53.707 --> 38:55.333
I had another Tet spell, didn't I?

38:56.460 --> 39:00.297
We'll need to conduct more tests.
But your speech and memory seem intact,

39:00.297 --> 39:03.592
and with regard to your heart,
we expect a full recovery.

39:03.592 --> 39:07.512
And with time, you may recover
your full cognitive abilities as well.

39:08.055 --> 39:09.014
Maybe.

39:10.557 --> 39:14.686
But for now,
I'll just focus on being here.

39:30.285 --> 39:34.456
"It's the greening of the trees
that really gets to me.

39:36.124 --> 39:38.877
When all the shock of white and taffy

39:38.877 --> 39:42.297
leave the pavement strewn
with the confetti of aftermath,

39:44.174 --> 39:45.801
<i>the leaves come.</i>

39:46.593 --> 39:48.762
<i>patient, plodding.</i>

39:50.013 --> 39:53.809
<i>a green skin growing over
whatever winter did to us.</i>

39:55.811 --> 39:59.564
<i>a return to the strange idea
of continuous living,</i>

39:59.898 --> 40:03.276
<i>despite the mess of us,
the hurt, the empty."</i>

40:04.236 --> 40:05.612
Shaun, what?

40:06.571 --> 40:09.866
Lea thinks that because I am going
to be a dad,

40:10.617 --> 40:12.577
I am worried about my family.

40:14.663 --> 40:15.914
Okay.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.917
She also thinks you are scared.

40:20.335 --> 40:21.878
I'm not scared, Shaun. I'm fine.

40:21.878 --> 40:25.799
She says if you don't want to do the scan,
I should let it go.

40:29.386 --> 40:30.595
She...

40:32.848 --> 40:34.224
is right.

40:36.101 --> 40:37.686
Good. Thank you.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.231
I am scared.

40:54.828 --> 40:56.037
Dr. Glassman.

41:00.667 --> 41:04.212
I am asking you to do the scan.

41:05.755 --> 41:06.923
Because...

41:08.633 --> 41:11.970
the data and the evidence are sound.

41:17.809 --> 41:18.977
And because...

41:26.651 --> 41:30.989
it would be hard to lose my father
just as I am about to become one.

41:38.872 --> 41:40.457
Do the scan for me.

41:52.552 --> 41:55.055
Shaun, I'll do the scan.

42:13.657 --> 42:15.492
<i>"'Fine, then, I'll take it,'</i>

42:15.951 --> 42:21.164
<i>the tree seems to say. A new slick leaf
unfurling like a fist to an open pond.</i>

42:22.123 --> 42:23.416
<i>'I'll take it all.'"</i>
