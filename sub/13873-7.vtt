WEBVTT

00:07.674 --> 00:09.574
Spacecataz.

00:09.609 --> 00:12.737
Oh, damn it!
Why, he hung up again.

00:13.947 --> 00:15.847
- Hello.
- Yes. Don't hang up.

00:15.882 --> 00:18.442
You may think I just called,
but I didn't.

00:18.485 --> 00:22.251
I'm looking for Mike.
His last name is Hunt.

00:22.288 --> 00:24.586
Does he live there? Ha ha.

00:24.624 --> 00:26.888
I can't pronounce his name.
You do it.

00:26.926 --> 00:30.089
You get it?
Michael Hunt! Ha ha!

00:30.130 --> 00:31.688
He doesn't live here.
You have the wrong number.

00:31.731 --> 00:34.131
That's right, I do.
They are so mad...

00:34.167 --> 00:36.101
that someone
keeps calling them...

00:36.136 --> 00:38.536
and asking
for wrong information.

00:38.571 --> 00:40.436
Hello?

00:40.473 --> 00:43.340
How you doing? Yeah, look,
um, my name's Biff...

00:43.376 --> 00:45.537
and I'm looking
for Holden McGroyne.

00:45.578 --> 00:49.036
Well, I don't think so,
but I'll ask.

00:49.082 --> 00:51.016
Do we know a Holden McGroyne?

00:51.051 --> 00:52.348
Hmm... no, man.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.613
I'm sorry, man.

00:53.653 --> 00:55.177
Well, how about
Oliver Klohsoff?

00:55.221 --> 00:57.121
How about an Oliver Klohsoff?

00:57.157 --> 00:59.921
- Ha ha ha!
- Nope. Him, neither.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.426
Why don't you leave a message?

01:01.461 --> 01:02.792
And if I see him,
I'll leave it for him.

01:02.829 --> 01:03.989
Just hang up.

01:04.030 --> 01:05.519
If you could just
give him this message...

01:05.565 --> 01:07.192
that he could please... off.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.360
Whoever you are,
you can... off, too.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.802
- Well, that's a rude message.
- Come on, man.

01:11.838 --> 01:12.964
Wait. Who is this?

01:13.006 --> 01:15.372
<i>This is who this is.</i>

01:15.408 --> 01:17.774
Suck on this!

01:17.811 --> 01:18.903
Oh, that's just great.

01:20.113 --> 01:22.638
My name is Shake-Zula

01:22.682 --> 01:24.650
The mike ruler,
the old schooler

01:24.684 --> 01:26.845
You want to trip?
I'll bring it to ya

01:26.886 --> 01:30.185
Frylock and I'm on top,
rock you like a cop

01:30.223 --> 01:32.623
Meatwad, you're up next
with your knock-knock

01:32.659 --> 01:35.219
Meatwad make the money, see?

01:35.261 --> 01:37.695
Meatwad get the honeys, G

01:37.730 --> 01:40.426
Driving in my car,
living like a star

01:40.467 --> 01:41.991
Ice on my fingers
and my toes

01:42.035 --> 01:43.593
And I'm a Taurus

01:43.636 --> 01:46.196
Uh, check-check it, yeah

01:46.239 --> 01:48.230
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

01:48.274 --> 01:49.764
Make the homeys say ho

01:49.809 --> 01:51.674
And the girlies
want to scream

01:51.711 --> 01:53.770
'Cause we are
the Aqua Teens

01:53.813 --> 01:55.405
Make the homeys say ho

01:55.448 --> 01:57.279
And the girlies
want to scream

01:57.317 --> 01:59.182
Aqua Teen Hunger Force

01:59.219 --> 02:01.915
Number one in the hood, G.

02:03.223 --> 02:06.090
Would someone please tell me
where the Steak-umms are?

02:06.126 --> 02:08.321
I ate the last one
for breakfast.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.658
Oh, that's great.
Oh, for break... you don't say.

02:10.697 --> 02:11.857
Wow. That's wonderful.

02:11.898 --> 02:15.664
So, uh, what in the hell
am I supposed to eat now?

02:15.702 --> 02:17.033
Nothing.
You just have to hold on...

02:17.070 --> 02:19.197
until I can pawn this TV
for some food money.

02:19.239 --> 02:20.467
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold it.

02:20.507 --> 02:22.907
No way. We are fed
by the government...

02:22.942 --> 02:24.170
and you know that.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.507
Look, Shake.
We're gonna have to get jobs.

02:25.545 --> 02:27.809
What, are you nuts? What about
that big, fat welfare check...

02:27.847 --> 02:28.939
we get every month?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.540
It doesn't come
until next Thursday.

02:30.583 --> 02:31.811
Now, either
I pawn this TV...

02:31.851 --> 02:33.216
or we're not gonna have
money for food.

02:33.253 --> 02:34.652
But we're detectives, remember?

02:34.687 --> 02:36.018
Remember I made the T-shirts?

02:36.055 --> 02:37.750
I bought the T-shirt cannon,
remember?

02:37.790 --> 02:40.520
I've been firing T-shirts
all over the neighborhood...

02:40.560 --> 02:42.790
that say we're detectives!

02:42.829 --> 02:45.423
Now we're going to look
like fools.

02:45.465 --> 02:48.662
We haven't detected anything
in three years, Shake.

02:48.701 --> 02:51.169
Well, I detect anger
in your voice.

02:51.204 --> 02:53.672
Now, pay me. I need to eat.
I need some Steak-umms.

02:53.706 --> 02:56.732
Good morning.
I'll have me two Steak-umms.

02:56.776 --> 02:58.243
You're about to learn the value

02:58.278 --> 02:59.768
of a hard...
day's night...

02:59.812 --> 03:01.780
because you need
to get out there...

03:01.814 --> 03:03.611
and start working at a job.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.481
That'd be a violation
of child labor laws.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.884
Well, he is right.
He's too young.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.253
Besides, there are
sanitation issues.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.554
That's right.
This hand's been up my butt...

03:12.592 --> 03:14.924
but I'll touch your food
all day long with it.

03:14.961 --> 03:18.590
Your congressman will know
about how...

03:18.631 --> 03:20.326
bullcrap this is.

03:20.366 --> 03:23.358
Shake, either I pawn this TV,
or we get a job.

03:23.403 --> 03:25.997
All right. Just plug that in
and let me think about it.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.166
That's when I do some of my best
thinking that's been done...

03:28.208 --> 03:29.971
with the TV on.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.542
So plug it in.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.945
Just put the two prongs
in the holes.

03:34.981 --> 03:37.916
I don't watch it.
I just need the back... uhh!

03:37.951 --> 03:39.543
What the hell is this?

03:39.586 --> 03:41.554
I told you...
fireman, astronaut...

03:41.588 --> 03:44.421
race car driver,
maybe bikini judge...

03:44.457 --> 03:46.982
and this is what I get...
food service?

03:47.026 --> 03:48.186
Are you kidding me?

03:48.228 --> 03:51.095
This is third world,
and I'm from the first.

03:51.130 --> 03:52.791
I'm number one, baby.

03:52.832 --> 03:54.129
I'm amazed that
they even hired you.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.897
No one else will do it.
They're taking that chance...

03:56.936 --> 03:59.496
and then if something goes down,
which it will...

03:59.539 --> 04:03.168
I will sue
the corporate office so badly.

04:03.209 --> 04:04.699
Look, Shake. We're about
to get the lunch crowd.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.974
So help me liquefy
this pork roast.

04:07.013 --> 04:09.243
Disgusting.
That's what we do here?

04:09.282 --> 04:11.307
Yeah. See, you just put
this roast on that press...

04:11.351 --> 04:13.546
- God, no.
- And then...

04:13.586 --> 04:16.180
You got to be kidding me.
You don't pull out the bone?

04:16.221 --> 04:18.247
No. There's a lot
of calcium in that.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.281
You didn't read
the orientation booklet?

04:20.326 --> 04:22.726
All I read are the zeros
on my paycheck.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.525
Look. OK. I'll do this.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.964
Why don't you go and give out
free shots of that ham?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.297
Yaagh!

04:28.334 --> 04:30.131
That was ham in that pitcher?

04:30.169 --> 04:32.330
No. That was fried chickwit.

04:32.372 --> 04:34.431
Who friggin' thought
of this place?

04:35.608 --> 04:38.042
Ha ha! Yeah. Oh, man.

04:38.077 --> 04:40.875
She is it. You are it, baby.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.710
Yeah. Shake them buns.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.046
Hey, Carl, we're home.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.448
We brought you back
some bratthirst.

04:45.485 --> 04:50.047
Get it? Brat... thirst?
You got to drink the sausage.

04:50.089 --> 04:52.284
Yeah. I'm watching my show,
so I tell you what.

04:52.325 --> 04:54.054
Set it over there
in the trash.

04:54.093 --> 04:56.027
So how was Meatwad today, Carl?

04:56.062 --> 04:58.622
- I don't know.
- Wh-what do you mean?

04:58.665 --> 05:00.292
Did he get in any trouble?
Did he break something?

05:00.333 --> 05:01.391
I don't know.

05:01.434 --> 05:02.594
Well, you were watching him,
weren't you?

05:02.635 --> 05:04.830
Yeah. I watched him help himself
to the medicine cabinet.

05:04.871 --> 05:07.704
Ha ha ha! One down, two to go!

05:07.740 --> 05:10.470
Ha ha ha! What?
I got things to do here.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.603
I ain't got all day
to jack around.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.839
I mean, I do that.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.747
I make time for it,
but I got schedules.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.011
Meatwad!

05:18.051 --> 05:20.315
Don't tell me he's dead.

05:20.353 --> 05:23.345
Please don't!

05:23.389 --> 05:25.949
Hey, your welfare check
come in yet?

05:25.992 --> 05:29.257
Payment will be received
upon discovery of the body.

05:29.295 --> 05:30.421
You know the contract.

05:30.463 --> 05:32.693
Meatwad, are you in here?
Meatwad!

05:32.732 --> 05:36.498
I'm Harmony, and these are
some good jellybeans, man.

05:36.536 --> 05:37.662
Meatwad, put those down.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.194
No one is here by that name.

05:39.238 --> 05:41.934
You're speaking to the all-being
formerly known as Meatwad...

05:41.974 --> 05:43.236
Let me see your eyes.
Are your pupils dilated?

05:43.276 --> 05:44.470
But I still handle his messages.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.568
Stick out your tongue.
Let me see it.

05:45.611 --> 05:46.771
Join me, brother.

05:46.813 --> 05:47.905
You're not supposed
to be able to open these.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.472
You don't want to open the mind,
open the doors of percept...

05:50.516 --> 05:51.949
Meatwad, look at me.
Meatwad, look at me.

05:51.984 --> 05:53.417
How many fries am I holding up?

05:53.453 --> 05:56.115
You come here to kill me.
Both y'all came!

05:56.155 --> 05:57.622
All right.
Just step back, please.

05:57.657 --> 05:58.988
The drugs
are making him paranoid.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.390
He could leap out at you
at any minute.

06:00.426 --> 06:01.586
I know how to deal with it.

06:01.627 --> 06:03.959
But you...
I know you're on drugs.

06:03.996 --> 06:05.361
You're in big trouble.

06:05.398 --> 06:08.162
I'm calling the police
right now.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.066
Look. We can't leave him
alone here anymore.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.661
That's why I'm taping
the fridge shut.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.729
We'll know exactly
where he is at all times...

06:13.773 --> 06:15.035
in the fridge.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.042
He's got food in there.
He'll be fine. What?

06:17.076 --> 06:19.476
I guess we need
some sort of sitter.

06:19.512 --> 06:20.877
I'll be here. I'm sick.

06:22.248 --> 06:23.772
I will be sick tomorrow.

06:23.816 --> 06:26.512
Yeah. Don't do this, idiot.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.112
Wait a minute. Is we on, man?

06:29.155 --> 06:30.622
Where are you going,
costume party?

06:30.656 --> 06:32.123
To work. Where's your uniform?

06:32.158 --> 06:34.558
I proved a point, OK?
I did it. I worked.

06:34.594 --> 06:37.154
What are you gonna do,
sell out to the man?

06:37.196 --> 06:38.891
Well, I'll be here
keeping it real.

06:38.931 --> 06:41.297
Well, you keep it real with your
vest buttoned today, buddy...

06:41.334 --> 06:42.961
because Ken is coming by...

06:43.002 --> 06:44.401
and I want to win
that rain poncho.

06:44.437 --> 06:45.597
Whoa! OK. All right!

06:45.638 --> 06:48.038
But just think.
What about Meatwad?

06:48.074 --> 06:50.599
He'll be here all alone
in the crisper.

06:50.643 --> 06:51.974
Oh, I've solved that problem.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.377
Uh, you OK, Meatwad?

06:56.416 --> 06:59.783
Hmm, yeah.
I'm just depressed.

06:59.819 --> 07:02.219
Plus, I got some
freezer burn back here.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.882
Well, I tell you what.
This should cheer you up.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.153
I made you this robot, and she's
gonna be fun to play with...

07:06.192 --> 07:07.750
and keep your little ass
in line.

07:07.794 --> 07:11.355
Meet... Robositter.

07:13.065 --> 07:15.625
Robositter?
Wow. That's original.

07:15.668 --> 07:20.105
Will you please once think
outside of the friggin' box?

07:20.139 --> 07:22.232
Robositter? Gah!

07:22.275 --> 07:23.606
Hey, what was the name
of that movie...

07:23.643 --> 07:25.042
where the guy is a robot...

07:25.077 --> 07:27.375
and then the doll was a robot...

07:27.413 --> 07:29.347
and it had Lance Henriksen?

07:29.382 --> 07:30.906
Yeah. What is that one?

07:30.950 --> 07:32.645
Well, that's a good one.
Use that name.

07:32.685 --> 07:33.811
Yeah. Use that name.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.753
Robositter,
what is your prime directive?

07:35.788 --> 07:38.586
To ensure the safety
and comfort of Meatwad.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.684
She is pretty hot.
Robositter, how old are you?

07:41.727 --> 07:43.251
Are you legal? Rrowww!

07:43.296 --> 07:44.354
Shake!

07:44.397 --> 07:45.796
Get lost.
Like you never thought of it.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.026
- I didn't.
- Yeah, right.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.761
Robositter, what are the rules?

07:48.801 --> 07:51.167
In bed by 7:00. No sweets.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.934
Robositter,
what will you be wearing to bed?

07:53.973 --> 07:55.565
- Come on, Shake.
- What?

07:55.608 --> 07:57.542
Throw a bag over those wheels,
and I'd do her.

07:57.577 --> 07:58.703
We'll be home after 8:00.

07:58.744 --> 08:00.041
Directives will be achieved.

08:00.079 --> 08:01.706
You have nothing to worry about.

08:01.747 --> 08:03.044
Where's your phone?

08:03.082 --> 08:04.572
You can call Candy Land
with this one...

08:04.617 --> 08:06.346
talk to Gumdrop Larry.

08:06.385 --> 08:08.444
You need a calling card
made of candy.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.388
You are in big trouble.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.254
I want the real phone,
and I want it now...

08:12.291 --> 08:14.782
or I will tear your soul apart!

08:16.462 --> 08:18.430
I'm telling. I'm telling.

08:18.464 --> 08:20.989
Tell who? The rage of hell
will feast upon you...

08:21.033 --> 08:23.467
and I'll make it happen!

08:23.503 --> 08:24.800
Hey, Sheila.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.896
You would not believe
what I think I did today.

08:26.939 --> 08:30.102
I was, like, at the mall,
and you know who was there?

08:30.142 --> 08:32.610
Derek. Grody Derek.

08:32.645 --> 08:33.873
Can I have some Imodium A-D?

08:33.913 --> 08:35.312
What did I tell you
about the hounds of hell...

08:35.347 --> 08:36.440
you retarded mutant?

08:36.482 --> 08:37.914
You said they was gonna get me.

08:37.950 --> 08:42.046
You can have a pill. Here.
Let me help you open them.

08:42.087 --> 08:43.645
Go see if they're open.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.122
OK.

08:45.157 --> 08:48.092
Someone broke a window
that needs a spanking!

08:48.127 --> 08:49.151
Oh, my God!

08:49.195 --> 08:51.163
Hey, I just
whipped this up fresh.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.630
Try it. It's on me.

08:52.665 --> 08:53.757
What is it?

08:53.799 --> 08:56.290
It's my vest, my tie,
and my name tag.

08:56.335 --> 08:57.893
You drink what I wear.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.768
Shake, have you cleaned out
those bone traps yet?

08:59.805 --> 09:02.831
No. Are you out of your mind?
I'm going to the arcade.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.901
Stop fooling around, will you?
Now, where's the change drawer?

09:05.945 --> 09:07.435
Uh-uh. Uh-uh, Shake.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.209
I'm the only one allowed
to work the register.

09:09.248 --> 09:12.274
Then I'll just have to see
if they will accept ham.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.479
- This is my severance.
- You can't quit, Shake.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.988
But I got Pac-Man fever.
Feel my head.

09:17.023 --> 09:18.581
Look, Shake.
Ken's gonna be here today.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.990
Yeah. Ken. I know.
The district manager.

09:21.027 --> 09:24.360
"I'm gonna do whatever
Ken tells me to do. "

09:24.397 --> 09:25.557
I quit.

09:25.598 --> 09:26.758
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Shake.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:26.799 --> 09:28.323
Ken says if we sell
a dozen drinks...

09:28.367 --> 09:30.392
they'll give us
a Slurp-a-Lunch rain poncho...

09:30.436 --> 09:31.835
complete with logo.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.338
Oh, yeah? Yeah.
Well, drink this.

09:33.372 --> 09:35.670
- What is it?
- It's the Slurp-a-Lunch rain poncho...

09:35.708 --> 09:37.039
complete with logo.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.067
I got it when I kicked in
the door to the prize cage.

09:39.111 --> 09:41.511
- I'm gone, brother.
- Wait a minute, Shake.

09:41.547 --> 09:43.447
Hey, Robositt...

09:43.482 --> 09:45.143
what are you doing
wearing a thong?

09:45.184 --> 09:47.709
All prime directives
have been achieved by 4:00.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.277
I said 8:00.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.849
Um, well, heh, robots work
twice as fast as humans.

09:52.892 --> 09:56.089
So I altered the time-space...

09:56.128 --> 09:58.460
barrier to...

09:58.497 --> 10:00.624
whatever. I did it.
Are you calling me a liar?

10:00.666 --> 10:03.726
Well, no. I just wanted you
to stay until 8:00.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.134
- Whatever.
- What? Whatev...

10:05.171 --> 10:07.969
why, you... you look like a little
tramp in that belly shirt.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.440
Come on, Sheila.
Let's blow.

10:09.475 --> 10:11.136
- Sheila?
- Um, I built her.

10:11.177 --> 10:12.405
She's my friend...

10:12.445 --> 10:14.276
and you have no right
to talk to her that way.

10:14.313 --> 10:15.678
I'll talk to her mother, then.

10:15.715 --> 10:17.148
Her mother lets her do
whatever she wants...

10:17.183 --> 10:20.710
because she's divorced
and she gets full custody.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.482
Wait a minute. I thought
you said you built her.

10:22.521 --> 10:25.012
Uh, doy. I built
her mother and father...

10:25.057 --> 10:26.649
and then I made them
get divorced.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.421
Well, Sheila,
does your mother know that...

10:28.461 --> 10:30.656
My brother says it's pathetic
that you work at Slurp-a-Lunch.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.630
I am assistant manager.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.530
We want
our baby-sitting money...

10:34.567 --> 10:36.000
because we're gonna
get tattoos...

10:36.035 --> 10:38.333
just above the crack
of our robot asses.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.771
All right. Fine.
The money's in there.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.172
You look like a total dork
in that hat.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.609
Thanks a lot for sending
me once again to...

10:45.645 --> 10:47.806
aah!

10:47.847 --> 10:49.712
You're liquefied, bitch.

10:49.749 --> 10:52.877
Hey, um, that was, like,
not very cool.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.852
Aah!

10:54.887 --> 10:56.787
Where are...
where are those girls?

10:56.822 --> 10:58.312
Did you give them
the money already?

10:58.357 --> 10:59.483
Does it look like it?

10:59.525 --> 11:01.755
I was supposed
to buy them wine coolers.

11:01.794 --> 11:05.992
So it's either you definitely
should not play with matches...

11:06.032 --> 11:09.058
or you definitely... should.

11:09.101 --> 11:10.864
It's definitely
one or the other.

11:10.903 --> 11:12.302
Which one you think it is, Carl?

11:12.338 --> 11:14.465
Dancing is forbidden

11:14.507 --> 11:17.999
Dancing is forbidden

11:18.044 --> 11:20.103
Dancing is forbidden

11:20.146 --> 11:22.512
Dancing is forbidden

11:22.548 --> 11:24.880
Dancing is forbidden
