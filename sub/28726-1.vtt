You didn't kill him. It was Kev.

02:51.793 --> 02:53.425
So?

02:53.427 --> 02:56.496
I don't care, anyway.
I got a tin.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.866
Oh, no! It's corned beef.

- Doesn't matter.

03:20.254 --> 03:24.324
Lasts forever. You can get it
from the War. Good as new.

Eat this.

03:44.346 --> 03:46.878
- Where you going?
- To help Da with the chickens.

03:46.881 --> 03:48.647
What?

03:56.858 --> 03:58.957
Shall we go watch?

03:58.960 --> 04:00.560
I'm not.

04:16.577 --> 04:18.711
- Davy?
- -I got one.

04:24.752 --> 04:27.420
- He's not here.
- Bet there never was one.

04:27.422 --> 04:29.488
- There was.
- How do you know?

04:29.490 --> 04:31.723
- Kev said.
- Well, maybe he was lying.

04:31.725 --> 04:33.893
- No, he wasn't!
- Alright, keep your hair on!

04:33.894 --> 04:36.461
- It's only a stupid owl.
- You wouldn't call it stupid

04:36.463 --> 04:38.598
- if you'd seen it.
- Come on.

05:10.932 --> 05:12.632
Oh, my god!

05:13.802 --> 05:16.035
- It's bloody Iwan!
- -Get him!

05:23.545 --> 05:26.812
- Idiot!
- Get off. Come on.

05:26.814 --> 05:29.415
Can't breathe!

05:44.031 --> 05:45.564
Come to watch the show, boys?

05:51.473 --> 05:52.971
Look after the bloody dog,
will you?

05:52.973 --> 05:54.072
Alright.

05:57.846 --> 05:59.911
If you chop their heads off
and put 'em down,

05:59.913 --> 06:02.615
they'll still run.
Run around for ages.

06:02.617 --> 06:04.684
- Have you seen it?
- Of course. Kev was here and...

06:04.685 --> 06:06.451
- La, la, la, la, la!
- And there was all this blood

06:06.454 --> 06:08.120
everywhere all over his shirt.

06:08.122 --> 06:09.488
No, there wasn't!

06:09.490 --> 06:10.956
And the spinal cord came out.

06:10.959 --> 06:13.024
Yeah, the blood was everywhere!

06:17.831 --> 06:19.766
- Rex!
- Rex!

06:19.768 --> 06:21.968
- He's going into Dai's!
- Rex!

06:21.970 --> 06:23.769
- Rex!
- Rex!

06:29.778 --> 06:31.043
It's alright. It's alright.

06:31.045 --> 06:32.577
There's sheep in the next field.

06:32.579 --> 06:35.047
We got him. Honest.

06:35.983 --> 06:38.050
Tell Kev I'll need him
in the morning.

06:38.052 --> 06:39.519
Alright.

06:45.894 --> 06:47.793
- Bye.
- See ya.

06:47.795 --> 06:49.995
- See ya tomorrow, boys.
- Ta-rah.

06:49.997 --> 06:51.062
Bye, Rex!

07:02.744 --> 07:05.677
- Where you off, boys?
- We're going fishing.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.747
- With that?
- We got darts.

07:10.117 --> 07:12.518
- Right then.
- You coming?

07:12.519 --> 07:14.019
Nah, not today, boys.

07:14.988 --> 07:17.456
Busy. Got to mow the lawn.

07:17.459 --> 07:18.891
Come on then.

07:21.196 --> 07:22.694
Little bugger!

07:23.764 --> 07:24.963
Look, he's still there!

07:26.800 --> 07:28.167
Nowhere near,<i> mun!</i>

07:28.168 --> 07:30.802
Look, I think
he's laughing at you.

07:30.805 --> 07:31.805
Oh, shut up.

07:33.074 --> 07:35.173
No! Look, he is!

07:35.175 --> 07:36.742
Right, that's it!

07:51.992 --> 07:53.091
Mom.

07:54.596 --> 07:57.230
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

07:57.231 --> 07:58.197
What for?

07:58.199 --> 08:03.603
Look, you're going to have to learn
to stand on your own two feet now.

08:04.838 --> 08:06.771
Go make yourself a bit of lunch.

08:06.774 --> 08:08.673
There's a ham in the fridge.

08:08.675 --> 08:10.242
Mind, don't cut
yourself carving it.

08:14.915 --> 08:16.716
I'll wait for Dad.

08:18.286 --> 08:19.752
Said I'd mow the lawn.

08:37.804 --> 08:38.804
Da!

08:50.183 --> 08:51.683
I'm sorry.

09:07.134 --> 09:08.634
You're not leaving.

09:17.611 --> 09:18.911
Don't love you anymore.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.986
- It's close.
- It's by our house.

10:00.989 --> 10:02.288
Come on.

10:20.207 --> 10:21.207
Dad, no!

10:24.645 --> 10:26.846
Probably Dai shooting rabbits.

10:49.236 --> 10:50.702
Can't see it,<i> mun.</i>

10:52.874 --> 10:54.440
Let's go, I'm thirsty.

11:06.788 --> 11:07.986
Boys, who wants a drink?

11:11.692 --> 11:12.924
- Bloody hell,<i> mun!</i>
- Water fight!

11:12.927 --> 11:15.961
Get him!

11:15.962 --> 11:18.063
- Get him!
- Get off!

11:19.900 --> 11:22.033
Christ. Calm down!

11:22.036 --> 11:24.870
- I'm going in for a Penguin.
- Get away!

11:32.713 --> 11:34.746
No, no!

11:34.749 --> 11:36.849
Mom, can I have a Penguin?

11:42.724 --> 11:44.823
It's cold. It's cold. It's cold.

11:59.005 --> 12:00.940
Robbie...

12:00.942 --> 12:02.207
Da?

12:02.210 --> 12:04.110
- No!
- No!

12:21.428 --> 12:22.794
Da!

12:27.467 --> 12:29.134
Come on. Oh, boy.

12:31.371 --> 12:33.404
Alright, boy.

12:35.209 --> 12:36.442
Alright, boy.

12:38.278 --> 12:41.480
Settle, Rex.

12:41.481 --> 12:44.015
OK. OK, boy.

12:44.018 --> 12:45.985
OK. Settle, boy.

12:47.187 --> 12:50.990
OK. OK. That's it.

12:50.991 --> 12:53.325
That's it.
You're a good boy, Rex.

12:59.567 --> 13:01.500
There's a good boy.

13:01.501 --> 13:03.067
Good boy.

13:56.456 --> 14:01.059
No, Rex.

14:22.884 --> 14:24.216
Robbie...

14:41.402 --> 14:43.034
Boys!

14:43.671 --> 14:46.238
Get away, boys!
Get out of there!

14:46.240 --> 14:47.940
Where is he?!

14:51.345 --> 14:53.144
I'll get my Da...

14:53.147 --> 14:54.513
Come on.

14:54.514 --> 14:55.914
Run!

14:56.584 --> 14:58.149
Run!

15:17.705 --> 15:19.404
Boys! Stop!

15:20.307 --> 15:22.341
What's happened? Boys!

15:40.061 --> 15:41.527
Dinner's ready! Come on!

15:41.528 --> 15:43.195
- Da!
- Now!

15:48.001 --> 15:49.335
Go and wash your hands!

15:51.172 --> 15:52.604
Come on, boys! Move!

15:53.474 --> 15:55.206
- Da!
- What?!

16:01.148 --> 16:03.581
6, 5, 4, 5. Yes?

16:32.679 --> 16:35.213
Alright. Don't stare.
Go around the back,

16:35.216 --> 16:36.381
see what you can find.

16:38.152 --> 16:39.283
On you go.

17:04.243 --> 17:06.211
Kev.

17:06.212 --> 17:07.679
Alright?

17:09.049 --> 17:11.049
It's alright, sit. Sit down.

17:16.257 --> 17:17.655
Boys...

17:19.692 --> 17:21.660
I'm so sorry.

17:25.199 --> 17:26.565
You okay for a minute?

17:31.238 --> 17:32.837
I'll just go
tell them you're here.

17:34.075 --> 17:35.406
Safe, like.

17:46.153 --> 17:48.787
Go home, for now. Can't have
you hanging around here.

17:49.589 --> 17:51.155
- Yeah.
- Go on. Off you go.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.157
Yeah, OK.

17:53.394 --> 17:55.326
<i>- S'ut mae,</i> Doctor.
- Hello, Sergeant.

17:59.834 --> 18:02.468
<i>Wedi mynd.</i> Both of 'em.

18:04.438 --> 18:07.138
He's inside,
brains all over the wall.

18:09.477 --> 18:12.611
Found the boys.
They're in a bit of a state.

18:13.814 --> 18:15.713
Waiting by there.

18:16.817 --> 18:18.483
Come and have
a look at this then.

18:33.733 --> 18:36.801
Sorry, I can't give you an
accurate time of death, Morgan.

18:36.804 --> 18:38.537
I haven't got
the right thermometer.

18:40.473 --> 18:42.207
I can't see it matters much.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.646
Well, here we are.
You don't see that very often.

18:50.784 --> 18:52.183
Do you want to be sick?

18:54.521 --> 18:55.887
No, sir...

18:59.826 --> 19:01.160
I know them...

19:02.429 --> 19:03.628
The son.

19:06.834 --> 19:08.366
Go with him, then.

19:32.593 --> 19:34.593
So sorry, boys.

19:42.903 --> 19:45.336
So who likes
fish and chips? Hmm?

19:46.673 --> 19:48.339
Robbie? You wanna...

19:50.877 --> 19:52.577
Let's get you away
from here, is it.

19:54.615 --> 19:55.913
Come on.

20:10.230 --> 20:11.930
There's an ambulance!

20:11.932 --> 20:14.532
Does that mean
she's going to be alright?

20:14.535 --> 20:16.367
No, Robbie lad. I'm sorry,<i> bach.</i>

20:19.440 --> 20:21.306
Right, come on.
Let's go across the fields.

20:33.820 --> 20:35.621
<i>Gan bwyll,</i> now, Davy.

20:39.893 --> 20:41.425
Do you want some more?

20:43.564 --> 20:45.631
It's got a nasty taste.

20:46.767 --> 20:47.965
It's alright.

20:50.804 --> 20:52.804
Do you want to
tell me what you saw?

20:55.675 --> 20:56.775
Nothing.

20:57.677 --> 20:59.644
We just went in for a Penguin.

21:09.656 --> 21:12.857
They can stay with us
in our room.

21:14.494 --> 21:15.693
On the camp beds.

21:53.534 --> 21:54.534
There we are then.

22:05.878 --> 22:07.645
We'll get some plates.

22:09.083 --> 22:11.849
Hello. Angela. Social Services.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.852
Yes. Yes, of course. Um...

22:17.724 --> 22:19.124
Which ones are yours then?

22:20.594 --> 22:21.893
These two here.

22:21.894 --> 22:26.397
Maybe you can take them next door
so I can have a chat with the boys?

22:28.402 --> 22:29.468
OK.

22:34.474 --> 22:35.740
In your room now.

22:36.876 --> 22:38.376
Come on.

22:55.128 --> 22:58.130
Hey, boys. I'm Angela.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.800
I'm here to look after you.
Kev, is it?

23:05.905 --> 23:07.471
You alright to have a chat?

23:09.742 --> 23:11.009
Yeah?

23:22.623 --> 23:24.489
Are you working, love?

23:24.490 --> 23:28.192
Doing the milk for Dai Hopkins,
and some other bits.

23:28.194 --> 23:29.693
Regular?

23:29.695 --> 23:31.563
Casual.

23:31.565 --> 23:33.664
- How old are you now?
- Nineteen.

23:35.969 --> 23:39.203
We've got two very vulnerable
little boys in that room

23:39.205 --> 23:41.205
and I think we both want
the best for them, yeah?

23:42.709 --> 23:44.742
- Where you living now?
- At home.

23:46.712 --> 23:48.145
It's alright, love.

23:48.147 --> 23:49.881
We can't have you
going back there.

23:49.883 --> 23:51.883
And the boys need proper
minding, isn't it?

23:51.884 --> 23:53.751
And that's what we're here for.

23:53.753 --> 23:55.619
Sorry, Davy. Come on. Off we go.

23:56.789 --> 23:58.890
Mum said they can stay with us.

23:58.892 --> 24:01.692
Oh, did she?
Well, we'll have to see.

24:01.694 --> 24:04.628
- But they can, can't they?
- Come on, off you go now.

24:04.631 --> 24:07.164
- Sandra?
- I can't find the spare sheets.

24:07.166 --> 24:09.567
We've only got blankets
and they're full of moth.

24:09.569 --> 24:12.703
- What are you doing, love?
- Oh, god. It's too hot for blankets anyway.

24:12.705 --> 24:15.840
- Sandra... Sandra, just stop.
- Where else are they going to stay?

24:15.843 --> 24:17.808
Look, they're sorting
that out now.

24:17.810 --> 24:19.044
We can't have them here, love.

24:19.946 --> 24:21.680
So what are we supposed to do?

24:21.682 --> 24:23.914
Nothing. It's down
to social services.

24:23.916 --> 24:28.586
- Why?
- Ugh. Davie, Go on. Go and find your brother. Off!

24:28.588 --> 24:30.055
We'll just be a minute.

24:30.057 --> 24:31.923
Boy has a hell
of a temper on him.

24:31.924 --> 24:33.924
Can't say more than that.

24:33.926 --> 24:37.863
But the son, he's not a bad kid.
He's just a bit of a fighter.

24:37.865 --> 24:39.865
Like his father.
Has he got a record?

24:39.866 --> 24:41.967
- Yeah, only for the fighting.
- Right.

24:41.969 --> 24:45.069
They've got nowhere
to stay tonight. Not proper.

24:45.072 --> 24:47.739
They can come with me
to the halfway house.

24:47.740 --> 24:50.674
Just temporary. Then we'll have to see
where we are in a couple of days...

24:55.781 --> 24:57.214
It's Davy, is it?

25:00.287 --> 25:02.287
Must have been
a terrible shock for you.

25:03.757 --> 25:06.924
Ah, Doctor...

25:06.926 --> 25:09.094
Yes. We were just
talking about the boys.

25:11.163 --> 25:13.932
Course.

25:21.842 --> 25:23.107
Bloody worshiped him, I did.

25:25.645 --> 25:27.311
Follow him anywhere but, like,

25:29.215 --> 25:31.082
he got so...

25:34.086 --> 25:36.788
It's alright,<i> mun.</i> Let it out.

25:39.992 --> 25:42.294
Do you want me to say
something to them?

25:42.296 --> 25:43.694
What do you mean?

25:44.330 --> 25:46.163
They're all in there
making plans.

25:47.334 --> 25:48.866
You should be part of it.

25:55.308 --> 25:57.075
There's nothing
you could have done.

25:58.612 --> 26:00.311
- I ran...
- Kev.

26:03.616 --> 26:04.883
It's OK...

26:11.090 --> 26:12.190
Kev.

26:17.830 --> 26:19.897
No, Kev!

26:19.900 --> 26:22.601
Sorry. Sorry.

26:22.603 --> 26:24.603
Not that,<i> mun.</i> How can
you be thinking of that?

26:24.605 --> 26:26.136
- I don't know.
- For god's sake, Kev.

26:26.138 --> 26:27.972
Ugh. Just fuck off, Yvonne.

26:27.974 --> 26:30.608
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

26:30.611 --> 26:32.743
I know what you're thinking.

26:32.746 --> 26:34.144
Just like his dad.

26:34.146 --> 26:35.913
A monster that
kills his own wife.

26:35.915 --> 26:37.115
- Kev...
- No.

26:55.067 --> 26:57.268
- They were nearly at it.
- No.

26:57.269 --> 26:59.971
They used to.
Used to park down the lane.

26:59.972 --> 27:02.707
Car all steamed up.
I saw it with Rhys.

27:06.212 --> 27:08.212
Shh. Christ, dog!

27:08.214 --> 27:09.881
Shut up!

27:11.384 --> 27:14.318
Alright! In!

27:18.692 --> 27:20.858
Where you taking him?

27:20.861 --> 27:22.961
- No need to worry about that now.
- Sarge!

27:31.171 --> 27:33.038
We need to get
the boys settled now,

27:33.039 --> 27:35.272
so they come with me
to the halfway house, alright?

27:36.308 --> 27:38.375
Where are you gonna
be staying tonight, love?

27:38.377 --> 27:40.412
They're staying with me.

27:40.413 --> 27:43.714
Kev, that's not going
to be possible right now...

27:43.717 --> 27:45.215
I'm their brother.

27:45.218 --> 27:49.119
Look, like I said,
I need your help here.

27:49.122 --> 27:52.022
The boys can't go
back to the house

27:52.025 --> 27:54.159
and you're hardly in
a fit state yourself, are you?

27:58.832 --> 28:01.865
Right. Come on, Kev.

28:01.867 --> 28:05.202
- No!
- Let's go and have a little chat outside, alright?

28:06.138 --> 28:07.872
- Doctor.
- -Come on, love.

28:13.246 --> 28:14.878
Hush, Rex!

28:14.881 --> 28:19.084
Davy, get back inside.
Now. Go on.

28:29.762 --> 28:33.498
Kevin, what do you think's going
through those boys heads right now?

28:33.500 --> 28:37.067
They need special care.
Very special care.

28:37.903 --> 28:40.471
And you know what?
You've got to help us.

28:40.473 --> 28:43.775
You got to step back. Would she
want you behaving like this now?

28:43.777 --> 28:44.808
Your mother, God bless her.

28:44.810 --> 28:45.943
Don't you dare!

28:45.945 --> 28:47.077
Take it easy,<i> mun!</i>

28:47.079 --> 28:48.846
- Kev!
- Come on!

28:48.848 --> 28:50.013
What?

28:56.056 --> 28:57.322
Just for now, is it?

28:58.991 --> 29:00.090
Come on.

29:16.509 --> 29:19.243
Hi, boys. You ready to go?

29:24.451 --> 29:26.351
You go with Charlie
there now, OK?

29:28.387 --> 29:31.923
You come with me. Good boy.

29:31.924 --> 29:33.391
Well done, Robbie. Good boy.

29:41.835 --> 29:43.968
Davy, leave them...

29:43.970 --> 29:46.336
- No!
- Davy.

29:46.338 --> 29:48.539
Where are we going?

29:48.541 --> 29:50.508
You and Rhys are coming
with me and Charlie, love.

29:50.509 --> 29:53.076
We've got a special house
for little boys and girls

29:53.078 --> 29:55.547
whose mummies and daddies
can't look after them anymore.

29:55.548 --> 29:58.082
Alright? Just for
a couple of days.

29:59.019 --> 30:00.884
Are you coming?

30:00.886 --> 30:01.920
Can't,<i> mun.</i>

30:03.423 --> 30:05.923
I'm not going. Not without Kev.

30:05.925 --> 30:08.826
Oh, Robbie,<i> bach</i>
You have to go, OK?

30:08.828 --> 30:11.362
I'm not! I'm staying with you.

30:11.364 --> 30:14.365
Robbie,<i> mun.</i> You can't.

30:15.402 --> 30:17.335
I can't look after you.

30:17.336 --> 30:18.368
Not proper.

30:20.006 --> 30:22.507
Come on now, Robbie <i> bach,</i>
time to go, OK?

30:22.509 --> 30:24.474
Robbie, Robbie.

31:13.326 --> 31:14.592
I'll be round!

31:15.961 --> 31:19.297
I will! I'll be round! Tomorrow!

31:21.902 --> 31:23.500
And we'll go
down the woods, is it?

31:41.988 --> 31:43.554
You shouldn't be so selfish.

31:43.556 --> 31:45.923
- What you doing?
- Going to see.

31:45.925 --> 31:48.558
There's been three
police cars past already.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.662
Ugh. Don't be a twat, Davy.

31:50.663 --> 31:53.530
Davy. You gonna tell them?

31:55.969 --> 31:57.201
They're arguing again.

31:58.038 --> 31:59.002
Wait!

31:59.005 --> 32:03.540
- I'm coming, too.
- -What do you think is going on in their heads?

32:05.945 --> 32:07.027
I don't know.

32:07.028 --> 32:08.111
Davy's acting
like it never happened

32:08.114 --> 32:11.082
and Iwan's like a bloody stone.

32:11.084 --> 32:13.116
And it happened
right in front of them.

32:14.153 --> 32:15.319
What possessed him?

32:16.355 --> 32:18.990
- He's evil minded.
- Don't, Sandra.

32:18.991 --> 32:21.224
- Well, what other reason is there?
- God knows, love.

32:21.227 --> 32:23.560
- Come, come here.
- No, Glyn.

32:24.596 --> 32:27.131
Nothing is ever
going to be the same again,

32:28.434 --> 32:30.101
not for them and not for us.

32:48.320 --> 32:51.288
I don't want this dog,
vicious bastard like him.

32:51.290 --> 32:53.758
Look, we can't keep
him cooped up at the station.

32:53.759 --> 32:56.426
Kev, if you don't take him,
they'll have to put him down.

32:58.064 --> 33:00.631
- I want to see the boys.
- Well, there's things we got to go through first.

33:00.633 --> 33:03.201
- Things I'd rather you heard from us.
- -What things?

33:03.202 --> 33:05.236
Come on, Kev. Come
and have a walk with us.

33:05.238 --> 33:08.271
- What?
- Look, we need to talk

33:09.209 --> 33:11.108
- about your mother.
- Where you going?

33:11.111 --> 33:12.777
- You knew she was leaving him?
- -What do you mean?

33:12.778 --> 33:14.479
- To get Rex.
- Davy.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.647
I'm sorry, Kev.
I know this is hard, but

33:17.650 --> 33:20.550
she was going to Dai's.
You know, to be with him.

33:23.056 --> 33:25.256
- Stop now!
- -Get off, you fucker!

33:25.258 --> 33:28.259
Alright now, that's enough. We've
got a duty to keep you safe.

33:28.260 --> 33:31.461
Kev, stop! For god's sake!
What's the use?

33:31.463 --> 33:34.065
- I'm going to fucking kill him!
- Kev, leave him be.

33:34.067 --> 33:37.134
Go on, get after him. I'll get
round to Dai's and head him off.

33:38.137 --> 33:40.505
- Get yourself home, boy!
- I want to keep Rex.

33:40.507 --> 33:42.707
- Out of here!
- But we look after him!

33:42.709 --> 33:44.142
Now!

34:00.093 --> 34:03.493
- No! Rex!
- Oh, Christ! You idiot!

34:03.496 --> 34:06.596
- Come on,<i> mun!</i>
- I'm not. Twat.

34:14.172 --> 34:16.474
- Kev. Kev!
- What?

34:16.476 --> 34:18.675
Listen. Stop. What's the point?

34:24.150 --> 34:27.318
- What are you doing here, boy?
- It's Rex...

34:27.320 --> 34:28.820
He's run off.

34:28.822 --> 34:30.487
Well, you better find him then.

34:32.224 --> 34:33.523
Kev's coming after you.

34:34.827 --> 34:36.661
He's down by the fields now.

34:46.639 --> 34:48.306
- Dai.
- -Kev, wait!

34:48.306 --> 34:49.773
I need you in the house. Now.

34:51.376 --> 34:53.210
- Let him come!
- Kevin!

34:53.213 --> 34:54.612
- Come here!
- Oi!

34:55.715 --> 34:57.414
Do you know what you've done?

34:57.416 --> 34:58.815
I'm going to fucking kill him!

35:00.820 --> 35:02.887
You try that again
and I'll whack you one!

35:05.291 --> 35:07.125
- Dai, bugger off!
- Christ, sir! He's upset!

35:08.561 --> 35:10.527
- Come here!
- Sarge!

35:10.530 --> 35:12.429
Get over there!

35:12.431 --> 35:14.297
Sarge, please.

35:14.300 --> 35:15.632
Open the bloody door!

35:15.635 --> 35:17.601
I'll have you!

35:17.603 --> 35:18.735
Right.

35:23.309 --> 35:25.610
Rex!

35:27.514 --> 35:29.280
I thought I told you to go home!

35:32.217 --> 35:33.684
Why won't you
let me look after him?

35:33.686 --> 35:36.420
- 'Cause he's a menace.
- Please!

35:36.422 --> 35:38.422
Argh. Alright.

35:39.791 --> 35:41.391
Get in there!

35:42.494 --> 35:43.894
In!

35:58.677 --> 35:59.809
How's it look?

36:00.746 --> 36:01.746
Bad.

36:20.266 --> 36:21.666
Do you want me to get my dad?

36:22.768 --> 36:23.768
Na, boy.

36:26.371 --> 36:28.472
Thanks for looking out
for me there.

36:28.474 --> 36:30.273
It was the dog really.

36:30.275 --> 36:31.309
Running off.

36:33.813 --> 36:34.945
What'll they do to him?

36:37.416 --> 36:39.784
Well it's a farm dog.
It won't take to being a pet.

36:40.686 --> 36:42.452
- So...
- Let's not think about it, eh?

36:45.257 --> 36:46.257
Gotta go.

36:46.925 --> 36:48.626
Gotta ask my dad about the dog.

36:49.628 --> 36:50.961
For the boys, like.

36:53.865 --> 36:55.266
Hey.

36:57.804 --> 36:59.769
Where did they take them then?

36:59.771 --> 37:02.472
Social Services, by town.

37:09.014 --> 37:10.414
Tell them I'm sorry?

37:13.619 --> 37:14.619
When you see them.

37:17.757 --> 37:20.257
Made their mam a promise, I did,
that they could come and...

37:21.760 --> 37:22.994
come here.

37:25.632 --> 37:27.264
But they had a home.

37:29.635 --> 37:31.601
Yeah, well, you just tell them.

37:37.577 --> 37:38.809
What did you do?

37:48.554 --> 37:49.719
Just sit...

37:51.023 --> 37:52.389
Her and me. That's all.

37:54.594 --> 37:55.659
Sit and just look

37:56.528 --> 37:57.628
for a bit.

38:00.867 --> 38:02.932
And we got used to the idea.

38:02.934 --> 38:05.536
She thought she'd come,
and the boys.

38:09.775 --> 38:11.541
And live here with me.

38:13.612 --> 38:15.012
It's nothing
if you can share it.

38:18.384 --> 38:19.983
You will come and tell me, eh?

38:21.487 --> 38:22.920
How they're doing?

38:24.724 --> 38:25.989
If you want.

38:35.735 --> 38:36.833
Alright, off you go.

38:42.442 --> 38:43.574
Go on.

38:53.885 --> 38:55.485
Urgh, where you been?

38:55.487 --> 38:57.922
There was a fight.
They took Kev off.

38:57.923 --> 39:00.123
We got to get home
and ask Dad about Rex.

39:02.128 --> 39:03.393
What you got?

39:04.063 --> 39:06.063
- Owl pellet.
- You never!

39:06.065 --> 39:08.498
- It was outside the window.
- I'm going to look.

39:08.501 --> 39:09.599
Come on then.

39:13.039 --> 39:14.371
Found it just here.

39:22.382 --> 39:24.382
Got one.

39:38.764 --> 39:41.699
- He's back!
- We got to tell the boys.

39:57.983 --> 39:59.083
Wow.

40:01.621 --> 40:02.987
Wonder what they're doing?

40:07.059 --> 40:08.458
We should go see them.

40:10.896 --> 40:12.429
They won't let you keep Rex.

40:13.166 --> 40:14.931
- Why not?
- 'Cause he's a nutter.

40:14.934 --> 40:16.733
Boys!

40:16.735 --> 40:18.668
What you think you're doing?

40:18.670 --> 40:21.070
You cannot go wandering off
like that. Not now.

40:21.072 --> 40:22.972
Mum, we got to look after Rex.

40:22.974 --> 40:25.141
God. No, Davy.

40:25.143 --> 40:27.445
God. Don't frighten me
like that.

40:27.447 --> 40:28.746
You have got to stay close now.

40:28.748 --> 40:30.780
It's not safe anymore.

40:30.782 --> 40:32.817
- Come on.
- We got to.

40:32.818 --> 40:34.751
You have got to stay
at home from now on.

40:34.753 --> 40:37.655
Understand?
The woods are out of bounds.

40:37.657 --> 40:39.956
You shouldn't be hanging round
here anyway. It's dangerous.

40:39.958 --> 40:42.960
You're not listening to me,
we got to look after their dog!

40:42.961 --> 40:46.996
Davy! Things are
different now. Alright?

40:46.998 --> 40:49.567
What are you thinking
about the dog for?

40:49.568 --> 40:51.869
Don't you understand
what's happened?

40:51.871 --> 40:54.771
Nobody cares
about the bloody dog!

40:54.773 --> 40:56.706
We're going home. Now!

40:56.708 --> 40:57.740
No!

40:58.577 --> 41:01.177
Davy. Davy, stop!

41:01.179 --> 41:04.914
- Get off!
- You have got to start talking to me, proper.

41:04.916 --> 41:07.117
No, I don't! I don't want to!

41:07.119 --> 41:08.885
Look, I'm sorry, right.

41:08.887 --> 41:11.755
I'm sorry We can't have the dog.

41:11.757 --> 41:14.692
I'm sure we can find someone
else who can look after him.

41:14.693 --> 41:16.059
I want to see Robbie and Rhys.

41:17.195 --> 41:18.195
Oh, come on, now.

41:20.565 --> 41:21.565
I'll go on my own then.

41:22.835 --> 41:23.867
Davy, stop!

41:25.003 --> 41:27.271
Fine! Fine.

41:31.177 --> 41:32.177
Alright,<i> cariad.</i>

41:34.213 --> 41:35.612
We'll go.

41:58.871 --> 42:01.237
They're just watching
a bit of telly before tea.

42:01.239 --> 42:03.239
Come in.

42:03.242 --> 42:05.976
Right, telly off.

42:05.978 --> 42:07.978
Uh, I was watching that!

42:07.980 --> 42:09.713
Turn it back on!

42:09.715 --> 42:11.614
- Turn it back on!
- It was so close to the end.

42:11.617 --> 42:13.884
Next door, please.

42:13.885 --> 42:16.653
Our guests need to spend some time
with the doctor and his family.

42:16.655 --> 42:19.856
- Stupid!
- Shona, Tania, Mimi, off you go now.

42:19.858 --> 42:21.824
- Oh, this is ridiculous!
- It's tea anyway.

42:21.827 --> 42:23.626
For God's sake! Urgh.

42:23.628 --> 42:24.961
Probably revolting!

42:28.266 --> 42:30.134
Hello, boys.

42:31.836 --> 42:33.269
How you faring then?

42:40.846 --> 42:43.681
We've been doing fine,
haven't we?

42:45.585 --> 42:47.083
Please take a seat, Doctor.

42:47.085 --> 42:48.152
And Mrs. Davies?

42:50.056 --> 42:51.255
Come on in.

42:52.992 --> 42:54.958
Davy, you can sit over
there on the floor.

42:57.228 --> 42:59.829
Hello, Rhys. Hello, Robbie.

43:02.001 --> 43:03.766
Have you got everything
you need, boys?

43:06.338 --> 43:07.938
We can get you something.

43:09.942 --> 43:11.240
Anything, really.

43:13.278 --> 43:15.311
We can go by the house.

43:21.052 --> 43:22.619
Has Kev been over?

43:25.657 --> 43:26.757
No?

43:29.094 --> 43:30.360
Do you want to play out?

43:30.362 --> 43:32.262
Davy. Not now.

43:32.264 --> 43:34.998
Why not? Do you want to?

43:36.068 --> 43:38.168
Well, it's tea now.

43:38.170 --> 43:40.304
But I was wondering if
the boys would like to stay?

43:40.306 --> 43:42.373
It would be nice for them
to have a bit of company.

43:42.375 --> 43:43.873
No need. Really.

43:43.876 --> 43:44.876
I would.

43:55.086 --> 43:56.086
Okay.

43:57.188 --> 43:58.322
Good.

44:03.795 --> 44:06.396
- Nice.
- Have it.

44:07.666 --> 44:08.831
But it's chips.

44:12.371 --> 44:13.871
Want to go out after?

44:14.806 --> 44:15.806
Not allowed.

44:18.210 --> 44:20.677
The barn-owl's back. I saw him.

44:20.679 --> 44:23.981
And there's loads of pellets.
God's honor! Look!

44:30.289 --> 44:31.289
Oh, disgusting!

44:33.391 --> 44:35.125
Come on, let's go upstairs!

44:41.701 --> 44:43.867
Come on,<i> mun.</i> I'll show you.

44:43.869 --> 44:45.735
Go fishing if you like, too.

44:45.737 --> 44:47.170
And then we'll come back
with the bikes.

44:47.172 --> 44:48.739
They won't let us.

44:50.041 --> 44:52.376
Listen. Can we have Rex?

44:54.480 --> 44:57.047
- What?
- Just to look after.

44:57.048 --> 44:58.449
If you say yes,
they'll have to let us.

44:58.451 --> 45:00.284
No. He's ours.

45:00.286 --> 45:03.052
You got to,<i> mun.</i>
They're going to put him down.

45:03.054 --> 45:04.353
Put that away!

45:05.990 --> 45:08.759
Rhys,<i> cariad,</i>
why don't you get down?

45:11.731 --> 45:12.829
Come on.

45:17.068 --> 45:18.735
So stupid.

45:21.440 --> 45:23.139
- Davy.
- Rhys.

45:23.141 --> 45:24.507
- Davy!
- Rhys.

45:25.911 --> 45:27.978
- Not allowed up here. Weirdo.
- Rhys,<i> mun.</i>

45:27.980 --> 45:30.047
Come on, Davy! Time to go.

45:30.048 --> 45:31.914
- But we haven't said goodbye yet.
- Next time.

45:31.916 --> 45:34.251
- What about now?
- Davy, we've got to go.

45:35.221 --> 45:36.853
But I've got to ask about Rex!

45:37.856 --> 45:39.222
- Hey!
- Uh, you're not allowed!

45:39.224 --> 45:41.190
- Stop it!
- Move!

45:41.193 --> 45:42.425
- Stop it!
- What are you doing?

45:42.427 --> 45:44.161
That's quite enough, young man.

45:44.163 --> 45:45.829
- You're not allowed up here.
- Davy, please.

45:45.831 --> 45:46.896
You're upsetting the boys.

45:46.898 --> 45:47.831
Please.

45:47.833 --> 45:48.798
Come on.

45:48.800 --> 45:50.434
I've got him.

45:50.436 --> 45:51.835
Right. Girls that's enough.

45:51.836 --> 45:54.103
- It's OK. It's OK.
- Davy.

45:54.106 --> 45:55.838
It's all over, OK?

46:00.512 --> 46:02.311
So, what did she say?

46:02.313 --> 46:04.114
Not many choices, see.

46:05.483 --> 46:07.885
They're talking
about a home. Swansea.

46:09.320 --> 46:11.088
And what does
Kev think about that?

46:11.923 --> 46:14.824
They're not telling him.
Be easier if he doesn't know.

46:14.827 --> 46:16.226
Not before they go anyway.

46:20.231 --> 46:22.166
Maybe it's for the best.

46:25.204 --> 46:28.271
They never seem to come out of
those places well, you know?

46:29.375 --> 46:33.110
Lot of rumors.
Nasty stuff. Nasty.

46:34.246 --> 46:35.246
What do you mean?

46:53.032 --> 46:54.164
Sorry, Doctor.

46:55.201 --> 46:56.934
Bit of bother with Kev.

46:56.936 --> 46:58.101
He's been scrapping with Dai.

46:58.103 --> 47:01.538
We need you to check him over
before we release him.

47:01.539 --> 47:04.173
No, no, we'll see him now. Take
him round the surgery entrance.

47:07.079 --> 47:08.244
Christ, Glyn.

47:09.215 --> 47:10.280
He's not a criminal.

47:23.161 --> 47:25.362
How you doing, Kev? Bearing up?

47:25.364 --> 47:27.431
Just been to see the boys...

47:27.432 --> 47:29.867
You stay in your room now
until they're gone,

47:29.869 --> 47:31.434
alright? Come on.

48:02.067 --> 48:03.233
I'm gonna tell them.

48:03.235 --> 48:08.204
- What you talking about?
- About them sending the Morris boys away.

48:08.206 --> 48:10.239
Don't be daft,<i> mun.</i>

48:10.242 --> 48:11.641
Davy!

48:18.483 --> 48:20.284
Just make sure...

48:21.286 --> 48:22.920
Nearly done, OK?

48:22.922 --> 48:24.954
Can we give you
a lift somewhere, Kev?

48:24.956 --> 48:26.590
- Got a choice, have I?
- -Course you have.

48:26.592 --> 48:28.291
They pay you extra on a Sunday?

48:28.293 --> 48:29.458
That's not fair.

48:29.460 --> 48:34.231
- Come on. Let us drop you.
- Still following me around, are you?

48:34.233 --> 48:37.134
- I'm just doing my job.
- Glad to see the back of us, you were.

48:37.135 --> 48:39.369
- Come on.
- Must have been a bugger landing back here.

48:39.371 --> 48:42.438
Think you can sort us all out,
is it? Make us all behave?

48:42.440 --> 48:44.574
You must leave Dai alone.

48:44.576 --> 48:46.643
They're not going to let you
near the boys until you do.

48:46.644 --> 48:48.644
Yeah. Well, the only reason
he's not dead in a ditch

48:48.646 --> 48:50.012
already is because of them.

48:50.014 --> 48:51.047
- Eh, come on.
- Kev.

48:52.251 --> 48:54.451
They're sending them off,
the boys.

48:54.452 --> 48:56.652
- What?
- Kev, I didn't know.

48:56.655 --> 48:59.322
- Up Swansea.
- Kev, stop!

49:02.193 --> 49:04.293
Stop causing trouble.
You have no idea!

49:04.295 --> 49:06.163
Why won't you do something?

49:06.164 --> 49:07.463
It's not for us to get involved.

49:07.465 --> 49:09.599
- Why not?
- Right, go to your room.

49:09.601 --> 49:10.967
I said, why not.

49:12.237 --> 49:13.637
Sandra, deal with him!

49:15.440 --> 49:19.108
- What you doing?
- I thought we'd go away for a few days.

49:19.110 --> 49:20.710
Stay with Granny.
Go to the seaside.

49:20.713 --> 49:22.346
- Wouldn't that be nice?
- No!

49:22.347 --> 49:25.248
Davy, we'll go
swimming every day.

49:25.250 --> 49:27.451
Get out of this heat.
Wouldn't that be nice?

49:27.452 --> 49:29.552
- No, it won't.
- Davy, you're going!

49:32.623 --> 49:35.257
- Don't you dare!
- Fuck's sake...

49:35.260 --> 49:36.994
Iwan!

49:36.996 --> 49:40.364
Davy, you have got to
stop being like this.

49:40.365 --> 49:42.132
You're upsetting everyone.

49:42.134 --> 49:44.701
I'm not going!
I'm staying for the boys.

49:44.702 --> 49:46.235
Davy.

49:47.106 --> 49:48.304
They don't want to see you.

49:49.340 --> 49:51.474
- Liar!
- They don't want to see you.

49:51.476 --> 49:52.509
Not again.

49:52.510 --> 49:55.378
Because it reminds them! It
reminds them of what happened.

49:55.380 --> 49:57.280
Can't you see?

49:57.282 --> 49:59.282
They have lost
their mother and their father.

49:59.284 --> 50:01.385
Don't you understand
what that means?

50:03.054 --> 50:04.186
Now look, Davy.

50:05.056 --> 50:07.257
You have got to
grow up now, alright?

50:08.659 --> 50:11.260
- See things as they are.
- Get off me!

50:11.262 --> 50:13.195
We'll go away for a few days!

50:15.634 --> 50:17.233
Well, then you'll stay
in your room!

50:20.438 --> 50:22.172
Davy!

50:22.173 --> 50:23.706
Davy, I'm sorry, alright?

50:24.777 --> 50:26.208
Just open the door.

50:28.047 --> 50:29.112
Davy?

50:32.451 --> 50:33.583
Davy.

50:35.653 --> 50:37.086
Come on, love.

50:38.824 --> 50:40.623
Alright, I'll leave you be.

51:23.268 --> 51:25.302
For God's sake,
call the bloody vet, will you?

51:35.380 --> 51:37.347
Good boy, Rex. Settle.

51:38.250 --> 51:39.583
Rex, sh!

51:39.585 --> 51:41.451
That's it. Settle.

51:41.452 --> 51:42.818
Keep your distance if I was you.

51:43.822 --> 51:45.188
He's alright, you know?

51:45.858 --> 51:47.157
Just needs a walk.

51:48.559 --> 51:50.393
Are you taking him somewhere?

51:50.394 --> 51:51.914
Does your mother know
you're down here?

51:52.764 --> 51:54.797
Yeah. She doesn't mind.

51:55.766 --> 51:57.434
Thinks I should
get out a bit more

51:57.436 --> 51:59.135
after what's happened.

51:59.137 --> 52:02.438
Sarge? County,

52:02.440 --> 52:04.407
taking an interest.

52:04.409 --> 52:05.474
Alright.

52:10.715 --> 52:11.815
Hello again, Davy.

52:14.786 --> 52:16.552
I know what you're
going to do with him.

52:18.456 --> 52:19.688
I'm sorry, love.

52:19.690 --> 52:21.190
He's not bad, you know?

52:22.327 --> 52:23.827
Doesn't like being tied up, see.

52:24.929 --> 52:26.295
Can I give him for a walk?

52:27.298 --> 52:29.199
Davy, it's not that simple.

52:29.201 --> 52:30.733
Give him something
nice to remember.

52:30.735 --> 52:31.867
Davy.

52:33.438 --> 52:34.838
You'll get me
in trouble, you will.

52:36.440 --> 52:38.909
The boys should see him
before he goes.

52:40.512 --> 52:44.514
I wouldn't tell them, like. And they
wouldn't know once they've gone to Swansea.

52:46.217 --> 52:48.385
Go on, Davy. Off you go.

52:49.320 --> 52:50.686
Go on.

53:12.510 --> 53:17.280
I'm going to get water, OK?
Good boy. Stay here, good boy.

53:20.552 --> 53:21.684
Won't be long now.

53:27.759 --> 53:29.458
Good boy. Good boy.

53:53.518 --> 53:54.684
Iwan, love.

53:55.554 --> 53:57.353
Go and see if Davy's
alright, will you?

53:58.824 --> 54:00.856
Could play a game or something.

54:05.429 --> 54:06.630
Davy?

54:16.608 --> 54:17.740
What's he doing?

54:19.443 --> 54:22.411
Nothing. Just doesn't want
to come out, that's all.

54:24.650 --> 54:26.548
We're just going
to play some Monopoly now.

54:28.954 --> 54:29.954
Good idea.

54:51.610 --> 54:53.710
- You can't come in here.
- Why not?

54:53.711 --> 54:56.646
'Cause we'll put a spell
on you. We're witches, see.

54:57.849 --> 55:00.817
Come on. I need a mirror.

55:20.405 --> 55:21.405
Robbie.

55:43.494 --> 55:44.693
Is Rhys coming?

55:45.530 --> 55:46.563
Upstairs.

55:47.532 --> 55:48.565
Go get him,<i> mun.</i>

55:50.702 --> 55:51.702
No.

55:52.771 --> 55:54.603
I got Rex.

55:54.606 --> 55:57.474
Nicked him.
He's at the Barn-owl house.

55:57.476 --> 56:00.577
Secret, like.
Do you want to go see? With Rhys?

56:00.579 --> 56:01.844
Can't.

56:03.081 --> 56:04.646
Why not?

56:04.648 --> 56:06.449
Just can't.

56:09.420 --> 56:10.686
I've run away.

56:13.791 --> 56:15.458
They're taking us
off to Swansea...

56:16.661 --> 56:17.994

56:17.996 --> 56:19.596
Don't go,<i> mun.</i>

56:19.597 --> 56:21.030
It's not good there.

56:21.032 --> 56:22.032
See you later.

56:23.735 --> 56:26.034
I heard my Dad
talking. Don't go.

56:42.521 --> 56:44.041
And What are you
doing here, young man?

56:46.657 --> 56:48.458
Just wanted to see

56:48.460 --> 56:50.460
if Robbie and Rhys
wanted to play out.

56:52.197 --> 56:53.797
Right.

56:53.798 --> 56:56.565
Well, you better
get off home now, OK?

57:07.612 --> 57:08.844
Better get off home now.

57:10.949 --> 57:11.949
Lost something?

57:13.552 --> 57:14.751
Where's my bike?

57:14.753 --> 57:17.820
Bye. Go on. Bye, go home.

57:18.856 --> 57:20.789
What are you still doing here?

57:21.760 --> 57:22.826
What a wimp.

57:23.695 --> 57:25.027
Give him his bike back.

57:26.565 --> 57:28.063
Why do you think we've got it?

57:28.065 --> 57:29.766
Because you have.

57:29.768 --> 57:31.467
You're nothing
special, you know?

57:31.469 --> 57:32.835
Just 'cause
you're in the papers.

57:32.838 --> 57:34.670
- Yeah, I seen it.
- Don't you dare!

57:34.672 --> 57:36.706
What? Going to go all
psycho again like your Dad?

57:38.543 --> 57:39.675
Shona, he's not worth it.

57:41.012 --> 57:42.945
It's a crappy
little bike anyway.

57:48.487 --> 57:49.487
Thanks.

57:51.690 --> 57:54.556

Rex!

01:02:24.795 --> 01:02:25.827
He was here.

01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:27.130
Liar!

01:02:27.132 --> 01:02:28.864
I swear on my mother's life.

01:02:34.105 --> 01:02:36.405
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:02:40.878 --> 01:02:43.179
Robbie,<i> mun,</i> stop.
He's not worth it.

01:02:43.181 --> 01:02:44.947
I hate you!

01:02:44.949 --> 01:02:46.815
- Come on, let's go.
- Don't go.

01:02:46.818 --> 01:02:47.983
He'll come back. He will!

01:02:47.985 --> 01:02:49.318
I don't care anyway.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.485
Don't say that!

01:02:51.889 --> 01:02:54.222
He was here. I promise.

01:02:55.393 --> 01:02:56.793
You're such a baby.

01:03:05.503 --> 01:03:06.536
Ah!

01:03:11.876 --> 01:03:13.342
Christ, Davy. Quit it!

01:03:15.112 --> 01:03:16.278
Bloody hell!

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:21.818
- He's gone demonic.
- Shut up!

01:03:26.157 --> 01:03:27.255
I'm telling.

01:03:27.257 --> 01:03:29.492
Go on then, tell.

01:03:29.494 --> 01:03:31.226
Yeah, who you
going to tell,<i> mun?</i>

01:03:35.599 --> 01:03:38.434
Christ, Davy, when you go,
you don't half go!

01:03:38.436 --> 01:03:40.402
I've got bloody shit
all over me now.

01:03:42.039 --> 01:03:44.440
Oh, shut up,
it's not funny. Come on,

01:03:44.442 --> 01:03:46.976
have a Look at me. What's on me?
Bloody owl shit, probably.

01:03:46.978 --> 01:03:48.911
- Christ! Keep away from me, you're humming.
- Sh.

01:03:48.913 --> 01:03:51.079
- It's nothing really, come on.
- No.

01:03:51.081 --> 01:03:52.447
- Running like a baby.
- Shut up.

01:03:52.449 --> 01:03:54.349
No, it's disgusting.

01:03:54.351 --> 01:03:57.152
Bloody nothing.

01:03:57.155 --> 01:03:58.420
It's Rex!

01:04:11.302 --> 01:04:14.070
Wait. There.
He's gone in with the sheep.

01:04:21.579 --> 01:04:22.579
Rex!

01:04:23.614 --> 01:04:25.380
- Rex!
- Rex!

01:04:25.382 --> 01:04:27.016
- Rex!
- Rex!

01:04:36.594 --> 01:04:38.327
Bloody hell, he's killed one.

01:04:46.237 --> 01:04:47.469
Bastard!

01:04:50.474 --> 01:04:51.606
Don't, Davy.

01:04:52.976 --> 01:04:54.043
You got him now.

01:05:05.523 --> 01:05:08.391
We can't just run away. Not now.

01:05:09.293 --> 01:05:10.659
We got to go up Dai's.

01:05:11.963 --> 01:05:13.161
Tell him about the sheep.

01:05:14.032 --> 01:05:15.697
I'll do it.

01:05:15.699 --> 01:05:17.432
Say it was an accident.

01:05:17.434 --> 01:05:19.402
Tell Dai it was my fault.

01:05:19.403 --> 01:05:21.003
He'll want him shot.

01:05:21.005 --> 01:05:22.505
Well, he can't.

01:05:22.507 --> 01:05:24.373
They weren't going to
let us keep him, anyway.

01:05:24.375 --> 01:05:26.474
- No.
- He's not your dog.

01:05:26.476 --> 01:05:28.110
He's ours.

01:05:40.557 --> 01:05:43.992
Come on,<i> mun.</i> I won't let him.

01:05:43.994 --> 01:05:46.061
Whatever happens. I'll tell him.

01:06:27.271 --> 01:06:28.436
What happened?

01:06:30.108 --> 01:06:31.239
I don't like this.

01:06:35.112 --> 01:06:36.411
Don't.

01:06:36.414 --> 01:06:37.445
We've got to.

01:07:13.384 --> 01:07:15.317
- No!
- What you doing here?

01:07:15.318 --> 01:07:17.420
- We're looking for Dai.
- Rex killed one of his sheep.

01:07:17.422 --> 01:07:19.054
Christ, what does that matter?

01:07:19.056 --> 01:07:20.056
He's gonna be shot.

01:07:21.425 --> 01:07:23.525
You'd better get out of here
before Dai comes back.

01:07:23.527 --> 01:07:26.094
We've run away.
They want to send us to a home.

01:07:29.699 --> 01:07:32.400
- Kev, wait for us!
- You got to go back.

01:07:32.402 --> 01:07:35.670
We can't. They'll think we did it.
It's all smashed to bits.

01:07:35.672 --> 01:07:37.739
- Well, that's your look out.
- You can't leave us!

01:07:37.742 --> 01:07:39.340
Don't be daft, Robbie.

01:07:40.644 --> 01:07:41.811
Mum said...

01:07:48.552 --> 01:07:49.751
Well, come on then!

01:08:23.554 --> 01:08:24.854
OK, come on.

01:08:44.341 --> 01:08:45.506
It's dark.

01:08:46.711 --> 01:08:47.908
I've got a torch.

01:09:02.426 --> 01:09:03.926
- Is that you?
- Huh?

01:09:05.595 --> 01:09:07.563
What do you do here?

01:09:07.564 --> 01:09:10.430
Talk about it when you're
a bit older, is it, Robbie?

01:09:16.474 --> 01:09:18.305
<i>Gor,</i> there's another one.

01:09:19.676 --> 01:09:20.943
So did you, like, love her?

01:09:22.712 --> 01:09:23.746
Proper?

01:09:25.814 --> 01:09:26.849
Yeah.

01:09:30.386 --> 01:09:31.587
Proper.

01:09:33.858 --> 01:09:36.323
Come on, stir yourselves.

01:09:36.327 --> 01:09:37.359
Help me find some wood.

01:09:58.748 --> 01:09:59.748
Used to cook on this.

01:10:03.787 --> 01:10:05.354
Well, once, anyway.

01:10:07.824 --> 01:10:09.291
What's going to happen now?

01:10:12.262 --> 01:10:13.662
Just stay here for a bit.

01:10:13.663 --> 01:10:15.264
You're going to stay too?

01:10:16.333 --> 01:10:18.333
- Like that, would you?
- Yeah.

01:10:19.002 --> 01:10:20.868
Got some food in here somewhere.

01:10:26.409 --> 01:10:27.976
Oh, God. It's corned beef.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.849

01:10:42.627 --> 01:10:45.426
- You don't have to have any.
- I'll have a bit.

01:10:46.631 --> 01:10:47.863
And me.

01:10:54.971 --> 01:10:56.471
No, that's for you, boys.

01:11:01.578 --> 01:11:04.546
Got some sausage as well,
meant for Rex.

01:11:05.416 --> 01:11:08.283
- He must be hungry, too.
- Serve the bugger right.

01:11:08.286 --> 01:11:09.917
Doesn't know
any different, does he?

01:11:11.655 --> 01:11:13.588
Actually quite nice.

01:11:19.829 --> 01:11:22.997
We could just keep
going now. Run away.

01:11:23.868 --> 01:11:26.068
They'll be worried sick,
your mum and dad.

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:30.972
Come on, Davy.
We should go home.

01:11:30.975 --> 01:11:33.007
No! You're giving up,
I can tell.

01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:34.409
Come on. Enough now.

01:11:34.412 --> 01:11:38.012
- We got to put it behind us.
- No! You mustn't forget

01:11:38.015 --> 01:11:40.349
'cause then the bad stuff
will just win.

01:11:42.453 --> 01:11:44.619
It'll be like the good bits
were never there at all.

01:11:44.622 --> 01:11:48.023
- Stop, Davy!
- No! You got to,

01:11:48.024 --> 01:11:49.625
so you can remember it right.

01:11:54.899 --> 01:11:57.466
Nobody cares
about the stupid dog

01:11:57.467 --> 01:11:58.766
but he was there...

01:12:00.537 --> 01:12:03.604
barking at your dad, and jumping
up and acting all stupid.

01:12:04.608 --> 01:12:05.673
And your dad came back.

01:12:07.377 --> 01:12:09.043
Buried his face in his fur...

01:12:10.613 --> 01:12:11.747
and then he saw me...

01:12:12.783 --> 01:12:13.783
and he smiled...

01:12:16.119 --> 01:12:18.453
- like he was sorry.
- Shut up, Davy.

01:12:18.456 --> 01:12:20.521
No. Let him.

01:12:22.893 --> 01:12:24.592
He wasn't a monster, your dad.

01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:26.795
He wasn't.

01:12:27.698 --> 01:12:29.030
He was nice too.

01:12:30.033 --> 01:12:31.367
And your mum.

01:12:34.572 --> 01:12:37.692
When my mum and dad were arguing, I used
to think I'd rather be in your family.

01:12:42.011 --> 01:12:44.145
Something just went wrong
in his head, like.

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:50.418
And if they take you away
you got to remember that.

01:12:53.123 --> 01:12:54.957
Stupid bloody dog.

01:13:00.997 --> 01:13:02.530
All he bloody had in the end.

01:13:03.967 --> 01:13:05.900
You got to talk to Yvonne

01:13:05.903 --> 01:13:08.103
'cause, like, she's police now.

01:13:09.038 --> 01:13:10.639
And then you can stay with Kev.

01:13:11.509 --> 01:13:13.609
- Proper.
- That's right,<i> mun.</i>

01:13:15.045 --> 01:13:16.145
What you pretending for?

01:13:16.146 --> 01:13:19.680
- They're not going to listen to her.
- Sh, Rhys.

01:13:19.682 --> 01:13:23.752
- What's the point? It's a fib.
- No, it's not. Why?

01:13:23.753 --> 01:13:26.020
- Because of Dai.
- What?

01:13:26.023 --> 01:13:28.724
Mum was leaving to be with him
and she didn't want to tell you,

01:13:28.725 --> 01:13:31.025
'cause she thought you were gonna blab
to Dad. And Kev's going to give him

01:13:31.028 --> 01:13:32.994
what he deserves, aren't you?

01:13:32.997 --> 01:13:35.029
- That's enough, Rhys.
- No, it's not. You got to.

01:13:35.032 --> 01:13:37.966
Shut up,<i> mun.</i>
Enough now. Enough.

01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:42.438
I'll come back for you,
both of you.

01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:44.940
Promise.

01:13:46.476 --> 01:13:47.876
And then we'll disappear.

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:51.779
We'll just disappear somewhere.

01:13:54.185 --> 01:13:55.551
I talked to Dai.

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:58.587
He told me to tell you
he was sorry.

01:13:58.588 --> 01:14:00.488
It's none of
your business, Davy.

01:14:03.527 --> 01:14:05.860
They all get away
with it, don't they?

01:14:05.863 --> 01:14:06.863
All of them.

01:14:08.032 --> 01:14:09.497
And no one cares.

01:14:10.967 --> 01:14:12.067
I'm not going to let him.

01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:15.604
Not this time.

01:15:41.824 --> 01:15:42.890
Davy!

01:15:49.166 --> 01:15:50.666
Davy!

01:15:50.667 --> 01:15:52.167
Davy, stop! Where are you going?

01:15:52.168 --> 01:15:54.936
You tell Kev that
he's got to look after you.

01:15:54.939 --> 01:15:56.171
Cause I'm going to fix it.

01:15:56.172 --> 01:15:58.974
How? Davy!

01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:02.144
I'm going up Dai's, alright?

01:16:02.145 --> 01:16:04.645
We've got to wait for Kev.

01:16:04.648 --> 01:16:06.648
No. No, we don't.

01:16:08.586 --> 01:16:10.351
You can't come, Robbie.

01:16:10.354 --> 01:16:11.720
You'll spoil it.

01:16:12.622 --> 01:16:13.956
I got to do it on my own.

01:16:16.926 --> 01:16:19.293
It's the police!

01:16:23.266 --> 01:16:25.100
Wait for me!

01:16:32.042 --> 01:16:33.307
Rhys!

01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:34.310
Davy!

01:16:35.311 --> 01:16:36.811
Robbie!

01:16:36.814 --> 01:16:37.814
Boys!

01:16:39.182 --> 01:16:40.649
Iwan!

01:16:41.952 --> 01:16:43.251
Davy!

01:16:44.721 --> 01:16:46.087
Rex! Come on.

01:16:53.363 --> 01:16:56.797
Get after that dog,
get after him.

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.000
- Spread out now.
- Davy!

01:16:58.002 --> 01:17:00.668
Boys! Rhys!

01:17:16.086 --> 01:17:17.653
Come on!

01:17:27.096 --> 01:17:28.195
Jump!

01:17:49.118 --> 01:17:51.252
Boys! Are you down there?

01:17:56.793 --> 01:17:58.993
Boys, over here!

01:17:58.996 --> 01:18:00.127
It's Rex!

01:18:21.885 --> 01:18:24.019
Rhys! Robbie!

01:18:37.301 --> 01:18:39.000
Hold on to this for a second.

01:19:06.363 --> 01:19:08.529
Don't! I'll run!

01:19:10.067 --> 01:19:12.300
Where are they, Davy?
You tell me right now.

01:19:12.301 --> 01:19:13.801
You've got to find Kev.

01:19:13.804 --> 01:19:19.807
- Kevin can look after himself.
- No, he can't. You've got to find him

01:19:19.810 --> 01:19:22.877
'cause he's going after Dai
and he's going to kill him.

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.011
Tell me where they are.

01:19:26.315 --> 01:19:28.315
You've all just
given up on him, you know?

01:19:30.487 --> 01:19:33.054
- Davy.
- You got to help him.

01:19:34.358 --> 01:19:37.458
He's down by where you used to
go. When you was together.

01:19:37.461 --> 01:19:39.060
The hut by the railway.

01:19:42.064 --> 01:19:43.297
He likes you, mind.

01:19:44.268 --> 01:19:45.900
Proper.

01:19:45.903 --> 01:19:48.904
Loves you.
Yeah, we saw it in the hut.

01:19:49.806 --> 01:19:51.105
Forever, it said.

01:19:53.476 --> 01:19:57.011
- Come with me now.
- No, I got to go.

01:19:57.014 --> 01:19:58.479
I told you where he is.

01:19:58.481 --> 01:19:59.847
- Davy!
- No, let go!

01:20:03.854 --> 01:20:05.086
Jesus.

01:20:11.595 --> 01:20:12.993
Davy!

01:20:21.104 --> 01:20:24.338
- What happened?
- I done it. So you could get away.

01:20:28.377 --> 01:20:31.313
That's them.
They'll have us now.

01:20:31.314 --> 01:20:34.015
Come on,<i> mun.</i>
We need to keep on moving.

01:20:36.286 --> 01:20:37.286
Robbie.

01:20:38.454 --> 01:20:40.154
It's got a right old kick.

01:20:42.426 --> 01:20:44.559
Didn't think it would work
after getting in the river.

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:48.630
Did though.
Work underwater, Kev says.

01:20:48.631 --> 01:20:50.497
- Never.
- Yeah!

01:21:21.564 --> 01:21:22.596
Good boy.

01:21:24.001 --> 01:21:25.667
You can keep him if you like.

01:21:25.668 --> 01:21:27.234
Look after him for us.

01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:34.510
Come on,<i> mun.</i>

01:21:36.212 --> 01:21:38.345
We need to get to Dai's
before Kev does.

01:21:40.516 --> 01:21:41.516
You go.

01:21:42.653 --> 01:21:44.152
I'm puffed, see.

01:21:46.289 --> 01:21:47.289
It was good.

01:21:49.525 --> 01:21:51.426
Stay down here
forever, I would have.

01:21:53.262 --> 01:21:55.296
- Robbie,<i> mun.</i>
- I'll be alright.

01:21:57.634 --> 01:21:59.100
Kev will come back for you.

01:22:00.203 --> 01:22:01.235
He will.

01:22:02.072 --> 01:22:04.271
See you, yeah?

01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:10.211
Yeah. See you.

01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:27.996
Boys, quick. Come on.

01:22:31.969 --> 01:22:33.033
Come on!

01:22:49.418 --> 01:22:50.752
Alright.

01:22:50.753 --> 01:22:52.487
Don't run now, Robbie.
Don't run.

01:23:04.768 --> 01:23:05.768
Rhys!

01:23:08.637 --> 01:23:09.637
Boys!

01:23:12.509 --> 01:23:14.208
For Christ's sake, boys!

01:23:57.386 --> 01:23:58.485
Kept him then?

01:24:00.090 --> 01:24:02.390
He took that sheep. Killed it.

01:24:03.359 --> 01:24:06.493
Boys say you got to shoot him.
That's the law, isn't it?

01:24:08.131 --> 01:24:10.097
Never been right, that dog.

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.600
Always chasing around
where he shouldn't.

01:24:12.601 --> 01:24:14.234
Put the gun down, Davy.

01:24:15.104 --> 01:24:18.273
It's my fault. I was looking
after him and he got away.

01:24:19.542 --> 01:24:21.208
So now we've got to shoot him.

01:24:22.645 --> 01:24:23.711
I mean it.

01:24:25.849 --> 01:24:27.082
Alright, boy.

01:24:35.425 --> 01:24:37.859
Go on, you'll kill him
in the cow shed.

01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:02.182
Aright, give me the gun.

01:25:04.654 --> 01:25:07.588
Thought you could let him off
'cause he didn't mean it, like.

01:25:07.591 --> 01:25:09.256
That's enough, Davy.
Give me the gun.

01:25:09.259 --> 01:25:12.260
I need it.
Kev was going to come.

01:25:12.261 --> 01:25:17.198
- That's between him and me.
- No, it's not! Because he'll get in trouble if he hurts you.

01:25:17.199 --> 01:25:19.766
And it's all 'cause of you
in the first place.

01:25:19.769 --> 01:25:21.368
So I've got to do it.

01:25:21.371 --> 01:25:22.904
Listen, listen,
listen to me now.

01:25:22.905 --> 01:25:24.471
They'll send you away.

01:25:25.809 --> 01:25:28.208
- And that's it forever.
- No, they won't.

01:25:28.211 --> 01:25:30.677
'Cause I don't know
what I'm doing, do I?

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:31.813
'Cause I'm just a kid.

01:25:32.849 --> 01:25:35.516
And with you gone
the boys will be alright

01:25:35.519 --> 01:25:36.583
'cause Kev will stop.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.287
And then everything will
go back to how it was.

01:25:47.697 --> 01:25:49.430
You shouldn't have done it.

01:25:50.399 --> 01:25:51.733
When she arrived, I thought...

01:25:54.404 --> 01:25:55.435
this is it.

01:25:56.372 --> 01:25:57.538
A chance,

01:25:58.408 --> 01:25:59.408
isn't it?

01:26:01.645 --> 01:26:02.710
Davy,

01:26:04.381 --> 01:26:05.579
I loved her,<i> mun.</i>

01:26:07.884 --> 01:26:09.250
Well, you shouldn't have.

01:26:36.912 --> 01:26:39.279
He's going to need someone
to look after him, he is.

01:26:44.654 --> 01:26:45.819
Let me go, Davy.

01:27:50.353 --> 01:27:51.985
She's up there looking for you.

01:28:00.863 --> 01:28:02.729
Why are they making such a din?

01:28:04.067 --> 01:28:05.533
They need milking.

01:28:08.704 --> 01:28:09.804
Davy.

01:28:30.493 --> 01:28:32.060
You should have
stayed with them, Kev.

01:28:36.932 --> 01:28:38.065
You got to show them.

01:28:41.837 --> 01:28:44.738
All of them. That you can do it.

01:28:49.345 --> 01:28:50.712
