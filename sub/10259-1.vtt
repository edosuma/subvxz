the winter rains brought
a great flood to the valley.

Rex and the boss got most of
the flock onto the high ground.

49:32.301 --> 49:35.395
Then Rex went back
to look for the strays.

49:35.471 --> 49:40.636
He found them. They'd been
stranded by the rising water.

He tried to herd them across
to safety, but they wouldn't budge.

Too afraid and too stupid
to save their own skins.

It was freezing cold
and the water kept rising.

49:52.955 --> 49:57.221
Rex stayed with them
right through the night.

49:57.293 --> 50:00.592
By morning, the sheep were drowned.

50:00.663 --> 50:05.691

he was barely alive.
[ Babe ] Oh, mom!

was never the same again.

but he's almost totally deaf.

[ Fly ] All this was barely a month
before the Grand National Challenge.

50:25.988 --> 50:30.322
He tried his best, but he couldn't hear
the boss's calls, and it slowed him up.

but for the stupidity of sheep,
