Beauty & the Beast...

00:01.876 --> 00:05.365
I can't keep juggling this
line between beast and man.

00:05.366 --> 00:07.634
It's just,
it's too confusing.

00:07.669 --> 00:09.069
Come on, I gotta
choose one or the other,

00:09.103 --> 00:11.738
especially if I ever hope
to get Catherine back.

00:11.772 --> 00:13.674
I believe that your
relationship with Vincent

00:13.708 --> 00:15.141
is getting in the way of ours.

00:15.176 --> 00:17.010
No, it's not true.
No?

00:17.044 --> 00:18.578
You sure about that?
Be honest.

00:18.612 --> 00:20.180
Feels like there are three
of us in this relationship

00:20.214 --> 00:21.380
and sooner or later,

00:21.415 --> 00:23.282
that is gonna have to be
resolved, Catherine.

00:25.119 --> 00:27.400
For six years, I've been trying
to get revenge for my son.

00:27.421 --> 00:28.755
I'm not going to stop now.

00:28.789 --> 00:30.423
It won't
bring him back.

00:30.457 --> 00:33.893
At least the people who did this
to him will finally pay.

00:33.928 --> 00:36.195
Apparently,
there's a certain gene,

00:36.230 --> 00:38.831
makes them predisposed
to becoming beasts.

00:38.865 --> 00:41.434
That's how they chose
the kids for the orphanage...

00:41.468 --> 00:42.735
they all have that gene.

00:42.769 --> 00:45.238
And now Sam's trying
to create another one.

00:45.272 --> 00:46.672
Xavier Wright?

00:46.707 --> 00:48.241
Yeah.

Looking for Sam.
Go back to bed.

01:22.841 --> 01:24.142
It's five in the morning.

01:24.176 --> 01:26.310
What's wrong with your place?

01:26.344 --> 01:28.780
Well, I don't have facial

Isn't that how
you found me last time?

01:42.026 --> 01:43.427
Yeah, but it's against the law.

01:43.461 --> 01:45.729
I only got away with it before
because Gabe deputized me.

01:45.764 --> 01:47.964
Uh-huh. Did he give you
a plastic badge

01:47.999 --> 01:50.401
and a decoder ring, too?
I-I'm serious.

01:50.435 --> 01:52.403
I-I could get caught.
If I get caught--

01:52.437 --> 01:55.506
JT, look, the point is
we have to find Sam, okay,

01:55.540 --> 01:57.908
before he turns anyone else

At least he was
last time anyway.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.987
Besides, come on.

02:11.021 --> 02:14.490
I've gotta stop using

02:16.460 --> 02:17.827
Don't you think you've proven

02:17.861 --> 02:19.862
you can control your
beastly instincts by now?

02:19.896 --> 02:21.964
No. No. I haven't.

02:21.998 --> 02:24.500
At least not to Catherine.
Not yet.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.936
Come on, man, you know
that I want her back, okay?

02:26.970 --> 02:29.672
But after everything

02:31.308 --> 02:33.475
I-I gotta earn her

And to do that,
I have to show her

02:34.544 --> 02:35.878
that I am more man than beast,

Gabe kept you up last night?

03:21.189 --> 03:23.056
No, Vincent did.

03:23.091 --> 03:24.224
It was a dream.

03:24.259 --> 03:26.594
Oh... wait, you were
dreaming about Vincent

03:26.628 --> 03:27.828
while you were
sleeping with Gabe?

03:27.863 --> 03:28.863
Calm down, it's not

It was...

03:30.432 --> 03:32.666
more of a nightmare, actually.

03:32.701 --> 03:35.035
I killed Vincent.
You killed him?

03:35.069 --> 03:36.169
It was an accident.

03:36.204 --> 03:37.237
I went over to tell him
to stay away.

03:37.272 --> 03:39.539
We got in a fight.
He hit his head...

03:39.573 --> 03:40.607
It just seemed so real.

03:40.641 --> 03:42.609
Did you tell Gabe about it?
Right.

03:42.643 --> 03:45.112
He has enough issues with
Vincent and me <i>without</i> knowing

03:45.146 --> 03:46.579
that I'm dreaming about him.

03:46.614 --> 03:49.349
He'd probably be happy to hear
you killed him though.

03:49.384 --> 03:50.984
Oh, what? This is all
your dad's fault anyway,

03:51.019 --> 03:52.252
for putting in your head

03:52.287 --> 03:54.521
that you're some kind of
beast hunter or something.

03:54.555 --> 03:56.122
Thank you, Dr. Freud.

03:56.156 --> 03:58.024
Oh, what, you think
there's more to it?

03:58.058 --> 04:00.092
I don't think that I
secretly want to kill Vincent,

04:00.127 --> 04:02.128
if that's what you're asking.

04:02.162 --> 04:03.797
But it's hard
moving on with Gabe,

04:03.831 --> 04:06.132
when Vincent's still lurking
about, even in my subconscious.

04:06.166 --> 04:07.366
So what are you going to do?

04:07.401 --> 04:09.081
I'm gonna do everything
I can to catch Sam.

04:09.102 --> 04:10.769
Sam. What does Sam
have to do with it?

04:10.804 --> 04:12.104
Well, we're all
after him, right?

04:12.139 --> 04:14.340
Especially Vincent, now that
Sam's making another beast.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.741
Which means, like it or not,

04:15.775 --> 04:17.442
we're both working
on the same case.

04:17.476 --> 04:19.711
Ah, so the sooner
you can put Sam away--

04:19.745 --> 04:21.512
The sooner I can focus on Gabe.

04:22.515 --> 04:24.083
Less beast equals less Vincent.

04:27.286 --> 04:29.488
Have you seen
this guy around here?

04:29.522 --> 04:30.689
No. Sorry.

04:31.958 --> 04:33.158
Any luck?

04:33.192 --> 04:34.793
No. No one's seen him.

04:34.828 --> 04:36.462
Are you sure
this is the right block?

04:36.496 --> 04:37.596
Yeah. 14th and Broadway.

04:37.630 --> 04:38.764
That's the surveillance camera

04:38.798 --> 04:40.398
we saw Sam on 20 minutes ago.

04:40.433 --> 04:41.834
Well, he's gone.

04:41.868 --> 04:44.235
You know, at this rate,
we're never going to find him.

04:44.270 --> 04:45.636
There is a way.

04:45.671 --> 04:48.506
No. No. Okay. I told you,
I-I am not doing it.

04:48.540 --> 04:49.841
You wanna find him,
don't you?

04:49.875 --> 04:51.509
Yeah. I wanna find him
the right way.

04:51.543 --> 04:53.211
But the right way
ain't working.

04:54.313 --> 04:56.114
JT, no, I am not
tracking him, okay?

04:56.148 --> 04:57.248
I can't.

04:57.283 --> 04:58.649
You really wanna
impress Cat?

04:58.684 --> 05:00.818
<i>Catch</i> her bad guy for her.

05:00.853 --> 05:03.020
And besides,

your other half, Vincent.

05:04.523 --> 05:05.656
That's you, too.

05:05.691 --> 05:07.191
Come on, one little sniff.

05:07.225 --> 05:08.526
It's not gonna,

you know, knock you off
the beast wagon.

05:29.481 --> 05:30.481
Coming.

05:31.716 --> 05:33.282
Hey.
Hey.

05:33.317 --> 05:34.851
I was wondering where you went.
Oh. Sorry.

05:34.886 --> 05:36.152
I should have left you a note.

05:36.186 --> 05:38.822
I met Tess for coffee
and I didn't want to wake you.

05:38.856 --> 05:41.057
No worries, you don't
owe me an explanation.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.358
I just missed seeing you
when I woke up.

05:42.393 --> 05:44.528
Aw...
Want some breakfast?

05:44.562 --> 05:46.796
No. I want Sam.

05:46.831 --> 05:48.297
Tess is trying to find him
by tracking down

05:48.332 --> 05:49.965
which Muirfield orphan
he's after next.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.235
Right, because they are
predisposed to becoming beasts.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.470
And, assuming we find him,

05:54.505 --> 05:56.639
I'm trying to build a case
to arrest and hold him on.

05:56.673 --> 05:58.674
Well, after everything he's
done, that shouldn't be hard.

05:58.708 --> 06:00.309
Harder than you think.

06:00.344 --> 06:01.677
Sam's not just
slippery in person,

06:01.711 --> 06:03.312
he covered
his legal tracks, too.

06:03.347 --> 06:04.680
He has gotten away with murder,

06:04.714 --> 06:06.314
but there's still no direct
evidence against him.

06:06.349 --> 06:07.683
Hang on, he-he tranqed you,
and kidnapped you.

06:07.717 --> 06:09.117
You could testify.

06:09.152 --> 06:11.186
To what? That he tried to
inject me with a beast serum?

06:11.220 --> 06:12.588
He knows I won't
say that in court.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.557
He's... smart.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.324
Smarter than you?

06:16.359 --> 06:18.027
No.

06:18.061 --> 06:19.995
And here's why:

06:20.030 --> 06:22.897
we can't nail him with
anything beast-related, but

06:22.932 --> 06:25.500
he took over Tony Barnes'
identity, right?

06:25.535 --> 06:29.037
He bought lab equipment over the
years, lofts, lots of stuff.

06:29.072 --> 06:30.872
And all in Barnes' name,
which means,

06:30.906 --> 06:33.408
I should be able to bust Sam
for identity theft, at least.

06:33.443 --> 06:35.910
Then, hopefully I can
build a case against him

06:35.945 --> 06:37.279
for Barnes' murder.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.613
Hmm.

06:38.647 --> 06:42.183
The DA's office must be
very happy to have you back.

06:42.217 --> 06:43.718
It's good to be back.

06:43.752 --> 06:45.519
And we make a good team.

06:45.554 --> 06:47.689
You bust 'em,

06:47.723 --> 06:48.923
I put 'em away.

06:48.958 --> 06:51.593
Well, the sooner
we put Sam away, the better.

06:51.627 --> 06:53.595
It would be nice to be done
with beasts, wouldn't it?

06:53.629 --> 06:55.196
Once and for all.
Subtle.

06:55.230 --> 06:57.631
Sorry. Too obvious?

06:57.665 --> 07:00.434
A little.

07:00.469 --> 07:03.137
I heard you last night.

07:03.171 --> 07:05.171
About your concerns about
Vincent being in my life,

07:05.173 --> 07:06.607
in our lives.

07:06.641 --> 07:07.908
And?

07:09.277 --> 07:11.144
And you're right...

07:11.178 --> 07:13.213
I need to do
something about it.

07:13.247 --> 07:17.951
And getting Sam,
getting past beasts...

07:17.986 --> 07:22.122
that'll help... us.

07:28.695 --> 07:30.196
Good.

07:36.703 --> 07:38.064
So you don't have
to knock anymore.

07:40.674 --> 07:43.243
Relax, it's just a key.
It's not a ring.

07:49.215 --> 07:50.883
Hey, JT. Can I call you back?

07:53.486 --> 07:55.187
What do you mean,
Vincent has Sam?

07:58.625 --> 08:00.325
Guess I got cocky.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.427
Dropped my guard.

08:02.462 --> 08:04.029
You're a good tracker,
I'll give you that.

08:04.063 --> 08:05.864
But now what?

08:05.898 --> 08:09.168
Now, we put you away,
so you can't hurt anyone else.

08:09.202 --> 08:10.636
That's what.

08:10.670 --> 08:13.272
Really?

08:13.306 --> 08:14.306
You think kidnapping me

08:14.340 --> 08:15.607
is gonna do that, do you?

08:15.642 --> 08:18.143
I didn't kidnap you, Sam.

08:18.177 --> 08:20.311
Well, I'm here
against my will, aren't I?

08:20.345 --> 08:21.880
That's kidnapping
in the eyes of the law.

08:21.914 --> 08:23.314
I could sue you.

08:24.583 --> 08:25.784
You believe this guy?

08:25.818 --> 08:27.451
What do you know about the law?

08:27.486 --> 08:29.954
I know enough to
get away with breaking it.

08:29.989 --> 08:31.556
Trust me, nobody's got
anything on me

08:31.590 --> 08:32.957
and I'm gonna
keep it that way,

08:32.991 --> 08:35.125
until they pay for
how they killed my son.

08:35.159 --> 08:36.860
Make who pay?

08:36.895 --> 08:39.563
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

08:40.932 --> 08:42.400
Although, it'll be
too late by then.

08:42.433 --> 08:44.402
Oh... just shut up,

08:44.436 --> 08:45.836
okay?

08:45.870 --> 08:46.904
You're going to jail.

08:46.938 --> 08:48.739
Now how are you gonna say
you found me, huh?

08:48.773 --> 08:50.340
Beast tracking?

08:50.374 --> 08:52.142
Courts tend to
like details, you know.

08:52.177 --> 08:54.078
We're not really
worried about that, Sam.

08:54.112 --> 08:55.679
Well, you should be.

08:55.714 --> 08:58.415
Cause I'm gonna make you
explain who you really are;

08:58.449 --> 08:59.983
or, rather, what you are.

09:00.018 --> 09:01.752
He's just trying to bait you.

09:01.786 --> 09:04.988
A beast who's responsible for
helping me create my own beasts.

09:05.023 --> 09:06.156
What are you talking about?

09:06.191 --> 09:07.824
I'm talking about Tori,
remember her?

09:07.858 --> 09:10.026
You're the reason
why I got her blood,

09:10.060 --> 09:12.095
while your friend here made the
beast serum in the first place.

09:12.129 --> 09:13.230
Don't listen to him.

09:13.264 --> 09:15.832
You're the reason Tori's dead.

09:15.866 --> 09:17.746
Which is why I can even
turn people into beasts.

09:17.768 --> 09:18.768
Think of Cat.

09:18.802 --> 09:20.903
Is that what this is about?

09:20.938 --> 09:22.839
You're trying to tame
your inner beast,

09:22.873 --> 09:23.873
so you can get
your girl back?

09:25.142 --> 09:26.902
Listen, you smarmy
piece of crap, it is over,

09:26.910 --> 09:28.111
you are done.
I'll get out--

09:28.145 --> 09:29.411
I'll kill you, first--
Vincent.

09:29.446 --> 09:30.446
You wanna kill me?
Vincent!

09:30.480 --> 09:31.981
You wanna kill me?!
Then go ahead.

09:32.015 --> 09:34.450
'Cause that is the only way
that you are ever gonna stop me!

09:36.120 --> 09:38.221
- Stop!
- Vincent!

09:48.234 --> 09:49.914
I wasn't trying to
hurt the guy, okay?

09:49.915 --> 09:51.844
I was, I was
just trying to find him--

09:51.845 --> 09:53.012
Which, by the way, we did.

09:53.546 --> 09:54.746
Yeah, but how?

09:54.781 --> 09:56.214
I think we all
know how, Gabe.

09:56.248 --> 09:58.317
Look, I'm not standing
in judgment, okay?

09:58.351 --> 10:00.051
I appreciate your efforts,
Vincent, I do.

10:00.085 --> 10:02.153
And God knows we all
want to bust, Sam.

10:02.188 --> 10:04.222
But we can't do it
by using...

10:04.256 --> 10:06.391
What? What were you
gonna say, beast justice?

10:06.426 --> 10:09.328
Yeah, frankly.
He's got that on us, on you.

10:09.362 --> 10:11.863
That, plus how well he covers
his tracks means we need

10:11.897 --> 10:13.932
to build a legitimate case
against Sam if we ever

10:13.966 --> 10:15.233
hope to truly
stop him.

10:15.267 --> 10:17.401
Okay, know, I know, okay?
And believe me,

10:17.436 --> 10:20.205
I was trying
to do the right thing, I was.

10:20.239 --> 10:21.672
But I...

10:21.707 --> 10:24.909
Okay, and that's why we called,
to do the right thing

10:24.944 --> 10:25.856
by handing Sam over to you.
Right.

10:25.857 --> 10:27.530
But you should've called before
you got him.

10:27.555 --> 10:28.713
Right, because

10:28.714 --> 10:30.548
we don't have a case yet.
At least not one that'll stick.

10:30.582 --> 10:32.583
Sam's a psycho!
He baited Vincent.

10:32.617 --> 10:33.459
From inside a cage?

10:33.484 --> 10:34.985
Well at least he's off the streets,
which means he can't...

10:34.986 --> 10:38.255
JT, it... it's fine, it's fine.
Just go home, man, and I will,

10:38.289 --> 10:39.557
uh, I'll see you later, okay?

10:42.227 --> 10:44.428
Okay, so what
do we do now?

10:44.463 --> 10:47.865
Guess try to bluff Sam into
thinking I do have a case.

10:47.899 --> 10:50.167
See if I can
salvage this mess.

10:57.342 --> 10:59.709
I hope you weren't
too hard on the guy.

10:59.744 --> 11:02.812
He's got... issues.

11:02.847 --> 11:04.714
Yeah, well, his
issues don't include

11:04.749 --> 11:06.583
stealing Tony
Barnes' identity.

11:06.617 --> 11:10.052
You're going for the Al Capone
approach, aren't you?

11:10.087 --> 11:12.154
They couldn't get Capone

11:12.189 --> 11:14.424
for murder, so the Feds
went with... what?

11:14.458 --> 11:16.058
Wire fraud?

11:16.093 --> 11:17.226
Tax evasion.

11:17.261 --> 11:19.628
Oh. Pathetic.

11:19.662 --> 11:21.430
Yeah, well.

11:21.464 --> 11:24.133
He still died a criminal, Sam,
just like you will.

11:24.167 --> 11:26.903
Come on, counselor.
Is that all you got? Really?

11:26.937 --> 11:29.405
Stolen ID, these days?
Will get you five years.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.640
That gives me more than enough
time to prove everything else.

11:31.674 --> 11:34.277
Hell, even probable cause'll
keep you tied up

11:34.311 --> 11:35.844
in legal wranglings for months,

11:35.879 --> 11:39.180
maybe years.
Which means...

11:39.215 --> 11:43.619
you'll have to wait even longer
to get your revenge.

11:43.653 --> 11:45.153
Oh, I thought that might
get your attention.

11:45.187 --> 11:46.588
See, we've got you, Sam.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.256
And I'll get you for
the capital crimes,

11:48.291 --> 11:52.093
too, I swear. But...
you can cut your losses,

11:52.128 --> 11:55.863
plea out, cooperate with
us right here, right now.

11:55.898 --> 11:59.267
And if you do, I promise I will
do everything in my power

11:59.302 --> 12:03.638
to help bring those responsible
for your son's death to justice.

12:03.672 --> 12:06.975
What do you say?

12:07.009 --> 12:09.043
I say...

12:09.077 --> 12:13.280
you let me loose if you don't
want anybody else to die.

12:13.315 --> 12:14.381
What's that
supposed to mean?

12:14.416 --> 12:16.216
It means exactly

12:16.251 --> 12:18.352
what it sounds like.

12:18.386 --> 12:20.655
I found my next beast
candidate before Vinnie here

12:20.689 --> 12:21.823
tracked me down.

12:21.857 --> 12:23.290
Have him
chained up, too,

12:23.325 --> 12:25.559
where nobody can find him.

12:25.593 --> 12:28.195
Man needs food and water
to survive.

12:28.229 --> 12:30.797
He's bluffing.

12:33.101 --> 12:34.668
No, he's not.

12:37.572 --> 12:40.507
Sam could be telling the truth,
but I can't be sure 'cause I

12:40.541 --> 12:42.041
haven't located all
the Muirfield orphans yet.

12:42.076 --> 12:43.743
How many have
you found?

12:43.778 --> 12:46.677
17, but that leaves nine
that aren't accounted for.

12:46.678 --> 12:47.373
Nine?

12:47.398 --> 12:49.398
How fast do you think
you can you find them?

12:49.684 --> 12:51.384
Not fast enough.
Damn it.

12:51.418 --> 12:53.987
Okay, just keep trying.

12:54.021 --> 12:55.388
We can't risk it.

12:55.422 --> 12:56.890
No, I know.

12:56.924 --> 12:59.058
Okay, what if I follow
Sam, try and save

12:59.093 --> 13:01.160
whoever he has captive now?
But if he catches you

13:01.195 --> 13:03.062
trying to track him again,
he might kill him.

13:03.097 --> 13:04.897
You can't just let him go.
Yeah, well, thanks to you,

13:04.931 --> 13:07.000
we don't have much
of a choice now, do we?

13:07.034 --> 13:10.103
Just let him go.

13:32.658 --> 13:34.459
My apologies,
I got sidetracked.

13:34.494 --> 13:37.462
Did anyone
come knock on your door?

13:37.497 --> 13:40.365
No.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.034
Water.

13:42.068 --> 13:44.469
Sure.

13:49.909 --> 13:51.609
Easy, easy,

13:51.644 --> 13:53.645
just sips.

13:57.850 --> 13:58.950
What's happening to me?

13:58.984 --> 14:00.785
You're in transition.

14:00.819 --> 14:02.420
From ordinary
to extraordinary.

14:02.454 --> 14:04.088
I don't understand.

14:04.122 --> 14:05.789
It doesn't matter. You're
gonna do exactly as I say,

14:05.823 --> 14:07.124
and you won't have a choice.

14:07.159 --> 14:09.393
It's part of the
injection I gave you.

14:09.428 --> 14:11.762
It makes you
very agreeable.

14:11.796 --> 14:13.330
What is it you want?

14:13.365 --> 14:16.667
I want you to help me find
the people who killed my son.

14:16.701 --> 14:18.602
Before you do,

14:18.636 --> 14:20.971
you're gonna buy us some time,

14:21.005 --> 14:22.839
take out the guy I'm betting

14:22.874 --> 14:25.709
is gonna try and save you first.

14:28.012 --> 14:29.512
And we're gonna
help him find you.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.525
I let myself in.

14:42.560 --> 14:45.027
I can see that.

14:45.062 --> 14:46.796
Where's Catherine?

14:46.830 --> 14:48.698
I came alone. To talk.

14:48.732 --> 14:49.999
About?

14:50.033 --> 14:53.102
Catherine.

14:53.136 --> 14:55.638
I know what you're doing.
It's pretty obvious.

14:55.672 --> 14:57.306
You're trying to
win her back by proving

14:57.340 --> 14:59.842
you're not the beast
she thinks you are anymore.

14:59.876 --> 15:01.644
How would you know
what Catherine thinks?

15:01.678 --> 15:03.558
'Cause she's staying at
my place now, not yours.

15:05.381 --> 15:08.117
Look, I commend you for
what you're trying to do...

15:08.151 --> 15:09.618
Screw you, Gabe.

15:09.652 --> 15:11.019
But it won't work.

15:11.053 --> 15:12.721
You can never
win the battle.

15:12.755 --> 15:15.491
For what, for Catherine?

15:15.525 --> 15:18.127
For your soul.

15:18.161 --> 15:21.463
Vincent, you are part beast,
just like I used to be.

15:21.498 --> 15:23.198
Which means I know.

15:23.233 --> 15:25.234
I know you can't ever
fully control it.

15:28.738 --> 15:30.171
Gabe, I'm not like you.

15:30.205 --> 15:32.473
That's right, you're not.

15:32.508 --> 15:35.510
Thanks to Catherine, I'm not a
beast anymore, I'm free of that.

15:35.544 --> 15:38.412
And because I am, I can offer
her something you never can.

15:38.447 --> 15:41.049
A future. Without beasts.

15:42.451 --> 15:44.418
Just stop thinking
about yourself,

15:44.453 --> 15:46.387
for once, and think
about Catherine.

15:46.421 --> 15:47.888
About what's best for her.

15:47.922 --> 15:49.524
Let me guess, is that you?

15:49.558 --> 15:51.091
At least I can
offer her a normal life.

15:51.126 --> 15:52.426
One without her
having to worry about

15:52.461 --> 15:53.927
my beasting out
at any given moment,

15:53.962 --> 15:55.763
like you did today.

15:55.797 --> 15:57.931
See, I don't have to worry
about controlling it anymore,

15:57.966 --> 16:01.334
but you do, and you always will.

16:01.369 --> 16:03.537
Vincent, if you
love Catherine,

16:03.571 --> 16:06.239
if you truly care about
what's best for her,

16:06.274 --> 16:07.875
you'll stay away.

16:07.909 --> 16:10.477
For her sake.

16:26.971 --> 16:29.740
I've been looking all over
for you. What are you doing?

16:29.774 --> 16:32.276
What's it look like I'm doing?
Okay, w-well...

16:32.310 --> 16:33.910
What about Sam? What happened?

16:33.944 --> 16:35.646
Well...

16:35.680 --> 16:37.147
Gabe let him go.

16:37.181 --> 16:38.915
What?

16:38.949 --> 16:40.250
Uh, uh, hold
on, rewind.

16:40.284 --> 16:41.785
What the hell's going on?

16:41.819 --> 16:43.419
What don't I know?

16:43.453 --> 16:44.988
A lot, obviously,
including the fact that

16:45.022 --> 16:47.090
Gabe told me to stay away
from Catherine. For good.

16:47.124 --> 16:50.126
And you let him live?

16:50.161 --> 16:52.961
Yeah, I did, because he's right.

16:52.996 --> 16:54.463
Sorry?

16:58.769 --> 17:00.002
Talk to me.

17:00.036 --> 17:02.505
What do want me
to say, man?

17:02.539 --> 17:04.740
Okay, look, I tried--

17:04.775 --> 17:06.509
I don't know, how
do I put this--

17:06.542 --> 17:10.444
going beast straight
for Catherine, and...

17:10.479 --> 17:12.281
it didn't work
out, okay? It'll never work out.

17:12.315 --> 17:14.415
That what Gabe said?

17:14.450 --> 17:16.852
And you're gonna buy that crap?
Yeah, because he's right.

17:16.886 --> 17:20.255
I can't control my
other side, okay?

17:20.290 --> 17:21.790
So it's not fair to Catherine.

17:21.825 --> 17:23.025
I'm always gonna be...

17:23.059 --> 17:24.526
what I am.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.962
So just be yourself.

17:27.996 --> 17:29.798
Both selves.

17:29.832 --> 17:32.967
Stop trying to be somebody you're not.
What are you saying?

17:33.001 --> 17:37.271
Look, Vincent,
you've gotten better, okay?

17:37.306 --> 17:39.040
You've already proven
your humanity's back.

17:39.074 --> 17:41.476
All you cared about yesterday
was doing everything you could

17:41.510 --> 17:42.844
to save a life, right?

17:42.878 --> 17:44.278
Yes, but...
But that doesn't mean

17:44.313 --> 17:46.814
you should ignore
your other half.

17:46.849 --> 17:48.682
Don't be ashamed
of that part of you,

17:48.717 --> 17:52.019
it's just something to be better
in control of, that's all,

17:52.054 --> 17:53.787
like you've been lately.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.823
Well, I
wasn't today, was I?

17:55.858 --> 17:57.391
Right, so you're not perfect.

17:57.425 --> 17:59.460
What's more human than that?

17:59.494 --> 18:02.796
It's all about finding
balance, my friend,

18:02.831 --> 18:04.130
embracing who you are.

18:04.165 --> 18:06.233
And, you know, that's
something in life

18:06.267 --> 18:07.401
we're all looking for.

18:07.435 --> 18:09.202
Not just you.

18:09.237 --> 18:13.139
Okay, is this another
of your pep talks?

18:13.174 --> 18:17.543
Yes, and pretty soon I'm gonna
start charging you for them.

18:17.578 --> 18:20.247
You know, maybe you should stop
thinking about trying to do

18:20.281 --> 18:21.614
what you think Cat wants...

18:22.917 --> 18:24.484
...and start doing
what you want.

18:24.518 --> 18:26.920
See where that leads.

18:29.423 --> 18:31.391
What do you want?

18:32.926 --> 18:34.894
I want to help
save anyone else

18:34.928 --> 18:36.863
from going through what
I had to go through.

18:38.265 --> 18:40.500
I want to save
Sam's next victim.

18:40.534 --> 18:43.936
Then track him down
and save him.

18:48.141 --> 18:49.608
His name's
Xavier Wright.

18:49.642 --> 18:51.343
History teacher,
he didn't show up to work

18:51.378 --> 18:52.778
and he didn't
call in sick.

18:52.812 --> 18:54.179
He's from the orphanage?
Yeah.

18:54.214 --> 18:55.948
He's on West 14th.

18:55.982 --> 18:58.017
Well, if Sam got him,
he's long gone by now.

18:58.051 --> 18:59.618
Call in master-tracker.

18:59.652 --> 19:01.853
Vincent? No. We got to
do this by the book

19:01.888 --> 19:03.122
if we're ever
gonna nail Sam.

19:03.156 --> 19:04.423
But don't you have to
catch him first,

19:04.457 --> 19:05.778
don't you need
Vincent to do that?

19:05.792 --> 19:07.526
Gabe doesn't
want to.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.394
And, frankly,
I don't blame Gabe.

19:09.429 --> 19:11.563
Especially after what
happened this morning.

19:11.597 --> 19:14.433
So less beast, less Vincent?
Both professionally

19:14.467 --> 19:16.134
and personally,
apparently.

19:16.168 --> 19:17.803
And you're good with that?
Yeah, Gabe's right.

19:17.837 --> 19:19.805
Vincent's way doesn't work.

19:19.839 --> 19:21.306
Street justice isn't justice.

19:21.340 --> 19:22.807
We have to follow the law,

19:22.841 --> 19:24.475
not make it up
as we go along.

19:24.509 --> 19:26.244
You're not gonna tell me
that's what separates

19:26.278 --> 19:27.946
man from beast next,
are you?

19:29.514 --> 19:31.816
Sorry.

19:33.585 --> 19:36.154
So, Gabe offered me
a key to his apartment.

19:37.856 --> 19:40.324
A key
meaning no big deal,

19:40.358 --> 19:42.259
or a key meaning
here's half the closet?

19:42.293 --> 19:43.727
What do you think?

19:43.762 --> 19:45.295
I think when a guy
offers a girl a key,

19:45.330 --> 19:46.597
it's more
than just a key.

19:46.631 --> 19:48.265
That's what I think, too.

19:48.299 --> 19:49.934
So, what are you
gonna do?

19:51.269 --> 19:52.503
I...

19:53.939 --> 19:55.939
...am going to find Xavier.

19:58.209 --> 20:00.677
Coward.

21:04.040 --> 21:06.541
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

21:06.575 --> 21:08.910
I asked you first.
What are you, like, six?

21:08.944 --> 21:10.345
I'm trying to look
for Sam's next victim.

21:10.379 --> 21:11.712
Yeah, that's what
I'm doing, too.

21:11.747 --> 21:14.715
Yeah, well, I was just
closing in on him, okay,

21:14.750 --> 21:17.084
until you rammed your car into me.
Well, it would have been justified,

21:17.118 --> 21:18.419
interfering with a
police investigation.

21:18.453 --> 21:21.689
Wait. If we're this
close to Xavier,

21:21.723 --> 21:22.990
Sam's probably nearby, too.

21:23.025 --> 21:24.525
Quick, get in
before he spots us.

21:31.399 --> 21:34.234
<i>Vincent, I know</i>
<i>you're trying to help,</i>

21:34.269 --> 21:36.236
I do, but I can't let
you get in the way.

21:36.271 --> 21:38.672
I have to track Xavier to Sam so
that I can catch him in the act,

21:38.706 --> 21:41.075
so that I can arrest him,
and Gabe can prosecute.

21:41.109 --> 21:42.443
Sam?
Yes.

21:42.477 --> 21:45.912
What about Xavier?

21:45.947 --> 21:48.848
You know he's an innocent victim
in all this, right?

21:48.883 --> 21:50.283
He's a person, too.
No, of course I do...

21:50.317 --> 21:51.751
Well, how do you plan
on saving him?

21:51.786 --> 21:53.954
Well, first, we
have to stop Sam.

21:53.988 --> 21:56.623
Okay, well, I want
to save Xavier from Sam.

21:56.657 --> 22:00.093
But how, if he's
already been injected?

22:02.096 --> 22:04.731
Wait. How did you get
on Xavier's trail?

22:04.765 --> 22:07.800
I picked up the scent
where I found Sam last. Why?

22:07.834 --> 22:09.702
I thought you said
that Sam knew how

22:09.736 --> 22:11.137
to cover his
tracks from you.

22:11.171 --> 22:12.905
Yes.

22:12.939 --> 22:14.707
But you had no trouble finding Xavier's?
No.

22:14.741 --> 22:17.210
Vincent, I think that Sam
wanted you to follow him.

22:17.244 --> 22:19.145
Oh, come on.
Why would Sam...?

22:32.291 --> 22:35.460
You okay?

22:54.313 --> 22:55.547
Hey! Hey, wait!

22:59.486 --> 23:01.921
You okay?
Can you reach the release?

23:01.922 --> 23:03.222
Hang on. Is this it?

23:03.257 --> 23:04.364
Ow.

23:04.389 --> 23:05.758
You all right?
Yeah.

23:07.627 --> 23:09.896
No, move your leg.
Okay.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.697
Okay.
Ow!

23:11.731 --> 23:13.732
Oh, God! Oh.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.267
Ah. Okay.
You okay?

23:15.301 --> 23:17.403
Yeah. Your knee! Your knee!
I'm sorry.

23:17.437 --> 23:19.170
- It's okay.
- Okay?

23:19.205 --> 23:21.106
All right.

23:21.140 --> 23:23.241
Wait, can you just
move my leg? Here.

23:23.276 --> 23:24.543
Which...? Here?
Yeah.

23:24.577 --> 23:26.612
Which way are
you gonna go? Oh, God.

23:26.646 --> 23:30.048
Ow. Oh, boy.

23:34.287 --> 23:36.221
Well, that was fun.

23:36.255 --> 23:39.257
Yeah, you could say that.

23:42.428 --> 23:44.195
Does your door open?

23:46.098 --> 23:48.032
No, we're trapped.

23:48.066 --> 23:49.801
The hell we are.

23:49.835 --> 23:52.637
Hang in there.

23:52.671 --> 23:55.139
Don't.
Fire department's coming!

23:55.173 --> 23:57.575
Okay. Thanks!
Thank you!

23:57.609 --> 23:58.810
Come on! Hurry!

23:58.844 --> 24:00.945
They're over here.

24:00.979 --> 24:02.980
This sucks.
Bright side?

24:03.014 --> 24:05.282
At least it's a department car.
My car's in the shop.

24:05.317 --> 24:08.319
What? Really? That is the
bright side to all this?

24:08.353 --> 24:09.820
Don't get mad at me.
This is your fault.

24:09.854 --> 24:11.989
How is this my fault?
Xavier was after you.

24:12.023 --> 24:14.425
I got caught
in the crossfire, like always.

24:14.459 --> 24:16.093
Well, he's just
following Sam's orders.

24:16.127 --> 24:18.128
What? You're defending him?
No, I...

24:18.163 --> 24:19.996
Over here, over here, boys.

24:22.834 --> 24:24.835
Hold on, we'll get you out.
Okay.

24:24.869 --> 24:26.570
Bring the jaws in, come on.

24:28.506 --> 24:31.407
Look, the point is, Sam's
gone to a lot of trouble

24:31.442 --> 24:33.810
to try and slow us down,
which he has succeeded at.

24:33.845 --> 24:35.345
He's probably
trying to buy time.

24:35.379 --> 24:37.413
Whatever his plan,
it's happening now.

24:37.448 --> 24:40.516
Right, which is the reason
we have to get out of here.

24:40.550 --> 24:42.852
You can't beast out. There are
too many people out there.

24:42.886 --> 24:45.455
No one is gonna see me here.
Yes, they will.

24:45.489 --> 24:46.922
It's probably Tess.

24:46.957 --> 24:49.325
Can you reach that?

24:49.360 --> 24:50.626
Here?
No! No! Sorry.

24:50.660 --> 24:51.995
No. It is... okay,

24:52.029 --> 24:53.829
it is in my pocket, Vincent.
Oh. I got it.

24:53.864 --> 24:55.698
You're... the back.

24:55.732 --> 24:57.833
I got it. I got it. I got... Wait.
Okay, good...

24:57.868 --> 24:59.201
Okay.
Yeah.

24:59.235 --> 25:00.803
Hello?

25:00.837 --> 25:02.437
Cat, good news.
Gabe?

25:02.472 --> 25:03.706
I think I just found Sam.

25:03.740 --> 25:05.340
He rented an office
on Tenth Avenue.

25:05.375 --> 25:07.009
Yeah, that's
like a block away.

25:07.043 --> 25:09.511
Okay, what number?
Wait. Is that Vincent?

25:09.545 --> 25:12.047
Yeah. Yeah, we're stuck.
It's a long story.

25:12.081 --> 25:15.050
Gabe, what's the address?

25:15.084 --> 25:17.486
1246. He signed
a short-term lease

25:17.520 --> 25:20.355
under the name of Tony Barnes.

25:20.390 --> 25:22.657
I'm sorry.
How are you stuck, exactly?

25:22.691 --> 25:24.526
Who are you texting?

25:24.560 --> 25:26.794
JT. Try and see if he can find
out anything about this address.

25:26.829 --> 25:28.796
It's got to be
significant, right?

25:28.831 --> 25:30.398
I already checked.
It's nothing.

25:30.432 --> 25:32.366
Wait. What is that?

25:35.070 --> 25:37.672
It's the Jaws of Life.

25:37.706 --> 25:39.841
The what?
Catherine, what is going on?

25:39.875 --> 25:41.876
We got in a little accident,
but we're fine.

25:41.911 --> 25:43.310
Can you move?
My leg is falling asleep.

25:43.345 --> 25:44.678
Okay, all right, sorry.

25:44.712 --> 25:46.680
Catherine?

25:46.714 --> 25:48.382
Yeah, I'm here, still here.

25:48.417 --> 25:49.883
How close are you?

25:49.918 --> 25:51.852
Too close.
What?

25:51.886 --> 25:55.489
I think he's
talking about Sam.

25:55.524 --> 25:57.758
- Oh. Oh, close.
- Good, because I'm on my way

25:57.792 --> 25:59.593
downtown, but you should
head over there now.

25:59.627 --> 26:02.930
And I'm-I'm sorry.
How, uh, exactly did Vincent

26:02.964 --> 26:04.397
end up in your car again?

26:04.432 --> 26:08.035
Does 1233 Tenth mean
anything to you?

26:08.069 --> 26:09.169
Is that across from Sam?

26:09.203 --> 26:10.837
Who are you talking to?
No.

26:10.872 --> 26:13.506
Apparently,
it is the biggest non-secret

26:13.541 --> 26:15.042
in Geekdom.

26:15.076 --> 26:17.377
Some CIA bunker off-site.
Gabe, did you hear that?

26:17.411 --> 26:19.345
Why would Sam care
about a CIA bunker?

26:19.380 --> 26:21.581
And what does that have
to do with his son?

26:21.615 --> 26:23.116
I don't know, but, obviously,
it requires a beast.

26:23.150 --> 26:24.951
Okay, we got to
get out of here.

26:24.985 --> 26:26.619
Good-bye.
Did you hang up on him?

26:26.653 --> 26:29.422
Hello?

26:29.457 --> 26:31.624
Yes, I did. Hey, buddy?

26:31.658 --> 26:34.694
Hey, buddy, I think
it's loose enough, okay?

26:34.728 --> 26:37.630
If you just pull, on three.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.887
One.

26:39.912 --> 26:41.300
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

26:41.301 --> 26:44.436
Two! Three!

26:56.449 --> 26:58.617
I'm fine.

27:00.320 --> 27:03.355
Thank you.
Uh, I'm with her.

27:13.035 --> 27:15.471
You should be
approaching an elevator.

27:15.505 --> 27:17.172
I'm here.

27:17.207 --> 27:19.308
Good, take it down
to sub-level 20.

27:23.313 --> 27:25.580
Xavier?

27:25.615 --> 27:27.515
There's no oxygen down there.

27:27.549 --> 27:29.618
Don't worry.

27:29.652 --> 27:31.987
Your new skills
will protect you.

27:32.021 --> 27:35.023
Close your eyes, focus.

27:44.833 --> 27:46.267
I'm in.

27:46.301 --> 27:47.502
Excellent.

27:47.536 --> 27:48.936
Remember to start the upload

27:48.970 --> 27:50.671
as soon as you reach the server.

28:00.381 --> 28:03.651
Xavier.

28:03.685 --> 28:05.886
Yeah, looks like it.

28:22.502 --> 28:24.203
What are you doing?

28:24.237 --> 28:26.038
I'm gonna go find Xavier.
You can't go down there.

28:26.072 --> 28:27.806
Don't you see the signs?
Catherine,

28:27.840 --> 28:29.741
Sam is controlling Xavier,
just like he controlled Jacob.

28:29.776 --> 28:31.243
Okay? He doesn't
care if Xavier dies.

28:31.278 --> 28:35.147
But I care if you do.

28:35.182 --> 28:37.049
Vincent, don't do this.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.484
You don't have to prove yourself
to me anymore.

28:39.518 --> 28:40.852
I am not doing
this for you, okay?

28:40.887 --> 28:43.254
I need to do
this for myself.

28:43.289 --> 28:44.890
I got Xavier, you go get Sam.

29:26.831 --> 29:28.265
Don't move.

29:34.772 --> 29:35.972
Whoa, easy.

29:36.006 --> 29:37.207
You're under arrest.

29:37.242 --> 29:39.976
Really? For what,
identity theft?

29:42.646 --> 29:44.080
What is that?

29:44.115 --> 29:45.648
What, this?

29:45.682 --> 29:48.752
This is my get-out-of-jail-free
card, Detective.

29:48.786 --> 29:52.555
<i>Xavier's wired with enough C-4</i>
<i>to blow himself and anyone</i>

29:52.589 --> 29:54.590
<i>around him to pieces.</i>

29:56.160 --> 29:59.828
<i>So I would drop the gun</i>
<i>if I were you.</i>

29:59.863 --> 30:02.298
How many innocent people have to
die for you to avenge your son?

30:02.332 --> 30:04.133
I don't care. Drop it now.

30:04.167 --> 30:05.368
I can't. I won't.

30:16.345 --> 30:18.380
Don't do this.

30:21.818 --> 30:23.351
No!

30:35.698 --> 30:37.699
If Vincent's dead, you're dead.

31:05.427 --> 31:08.629
Come on, breathe!

31:08.663 --> 31:11.031
Come on, man.

31:11.065 --> 31:13.500
Come on.

31:15.537 --> 31:17.504
Come on, man.

31:27.414 --> 31:29.382
Come on.

31:29.416 --> 31:31.551
Vincent.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.820
Damn it,
stick with me!

31:33.855 --> 31:35.521
Come on.

31:35.556 --> 31:37.090
Breathe.

31:40.260 --> 31:42.228
Come on.

31:42.262 --> 31:44.731
Keep breathing.
Just keep breathing, okay?

31:46.734 --> 31:48.434
You're going to be okay.
Just keep breathing.

31:48.469 --> 31:50.603
We're gonna get you
some help, okay?

31:53.073 --> 31:55.908
You okay?

31:55.942 --> 31:57.743
Did you get Sam?

31:57.777 --> 31:59.879
You could've died.

31:59.913 --> 32:02.348
♪ Already awake

32:02.382 --> 32:07.386
♪ My hands are shaking

32:08.488 --> 32:12.056
♪ For you.

32:14.689 --> 32:16.257
We're done playing games,
Landon.

32:16.291 --> 32:18.789
You're under arrest and you're
not talking your way out of it this time.

32:18.790 --> 32:20.427
Gee, aren't you even gonna
give me a chance?

32:20.428 --> 32:22.296
Shut up. I'm talking now.

32:22.330 --> 32:24.298
This isn't about
identity theft anymore.

32:24.332 --> 32:25.732
Now it's about
domestic terrorism,

32:25.767 --> 32:27.234
and those are federal charges.

32:27.269 --> 32:29.569
Really? Aren't you worried

32:29.604 --> 32:31.938
that I might share
our little secret about...

32:31.972 --> 32:34.107
Vincent?

32:35.443 --> 32:36.976
Look,

32:37.011 --> 32:38.879
wild accusations
aren't gonna

32:38.913 --> 32:40.947
get you anywhere
and you know it.

32:40.981 --> 32:42.549
I've got proof--
you don't.

32:43.083 --> 32:45.918
You know I offered to help.
I told you that I'd work

32:45.952 --> 32:48.487
with you, help you to find out
who allegedly

32:48.522 --> 32:50.322
killed your son,
but you wouldn't listen.

32:50.656 --> 32:52.390
I don't need your help.

32:52.425 --> 32:56.028
I can figure it out on my own.
What, you mean this?

32:56.062 --> 32:57.069
Because if you were hoping

32:57.094 --> 32:58.897
to get classified names
or something, forget it.

32:58.898 --> 33:01.566
It's encrypted, NSA level.
I know.

33:01.601 --> 33:03.101
And we have it
and you don't.

33:03.135 --> 33:04.102
Mm-hmm.

33:04.136 --> 33:05.937
Does that amuse you?

33:05.971 --> 33:07.572
Yes, it does.

33:07.607 --> 33:09.407
I'm curious,

33:09.442 --> 33:10.875
do you...

33:10.909 --> 33:12.877
even care how many lives
you've destroyed,

33:12.911 --> 33:15.780
how many people you've hurt?
Does that even matter to you?

33:17.015 --> 33:18.950
Do you believe in God,
Detective?

33:18.984 --> 33:21.119
Do you?

33:22.454 --> 33:23.988
I used to.

33:24.022 --> 33:27.091
I used to believe
that there was a Judgment Day,

33:27.126 --> 33:29.293
a reckoning when God

33:29.327 --> 33:31.428
would strike down
those who've done

33:31.463 --> 33:33.831
terrible things.

33:33.866 --> 33:36.667
But since I don't believe
in that anymore...

33:36.701 --> 33:38.068
Now you're playing God?

33:38.102 --> 33:40.604
No. I'm exacting justice.

33:40.639 --> 33:41.938
That's what the law
is for.

33:41.973 --> 33:43.641
These people are above the law!

33:43.675 --> 33:45.542
What people?
Who are they?

33:47.812 --> 33:49.980
Well, whoever they are,

33:50.014 --> 33:52.715
you'll never get
your revenge now.

33:54.118 --> 33:56.653
All the lives lost,
your life ruined--

33:56.687 --> 33:58.121
has it really
been worth it?

33:59.490 --> 34:02.793
Do you have any children, Lowan?

34:05.863 --> 34:08.864
Then you can't understand.

34:08.899 --> 34:13.469
All I understand
is you're going to jail.

34:13.504 --> 34:15.905
Book him.

34:23.045 --> 34:25.580
Come on, let's go.

34:27.350 --> 34:30.186
Any idea
why he's still so cocky?

34:30.219 --> 34:31.853
No.

34:34.389 --> 34:36.025
Gabe, I'm sorry.

34:36.059 --> 34:37.193
Really? For what?

34:37.226 --> 34:39.728
I was just happy for Vincent,

34:39.762 --> 34:42.230
you know? He just saved somebody's life.
You decided to hug him.

34:42.264 --> 34:45.199
It wasn't like it was something
I thought about doing.

34:45.234 --> 34:46.835
It just happened.
It was in the moment.

34:46.869 --> 34:48.402
And the two of you ending up
together in your car,

34:48.438 --> 34:49.904
was that just
in the moment, too?

34:49.938 --> 34:52.206
Well, it's not like
we secretly planned it,

34:52.241 --> 34:54.543
if that's what you're thinking.

34:54.577 --> 34:56.911
No. I'm not.

34:56.946 --> 34:59.747
I'm sorry, Catherine.

34:59.781 --> 35:02.183
I just, uh... I don't know.
I guess I'm just tired

35:02.218 --> 35:04.251
of being the nice guy
all the time, you know?

35:04.285 --> 35:07.355
And-and it's not like I don't have a lot
to make up for. I know that.

35:07.356 --> 35:08.869
No. No, you don't.

35:08.894 --> 35:11.552
You've more than made up
for everything to me.

35:12.126 --> 35:14.694
Then why do you keep ending up
in Vincent's arms?

35:15.930 --> 35:17.731
Look, Catherine,

35:17.765 --> 35:20.167
I want you in my life,
more than anything.

35:20.201 --> 35:22.902
You know that.
And I have bent over backwards

35:22.936 --> 35:25.004
trying to prove
that I am worthy of your love,

35:25.038 --> 35:27.707
but I need you to tell me
where you stand,

35:27.742 --> 35:30.943
how you feel
right now.

35:30.978 --> 35:33.380
Are you with me...

35:33.414 --> 35:35.749
or are you with him?

35:37.484 --> 35:40.086
I'm with you.

35:40.120 --> 35:43.222
Then I need you
to tell Vincent that.

35:54.467 --> 35:56.101
Are you sure
it's clean?

35:56.135 --> 35:58.937
Positive-- no sign of
beast DNA anywhere.

35:58.971 --> 36:01.573
Xavier is 100%
human again.

36:01.608 --> 36:05.577
I'm... still not sure
how it happened though.

36:05.612 --> 36:07.946
Same way Cat
saved Gabe,

36:07.980 --> 36:11.383
I guess. Both died as beasts,
both resuscitated as humans.

36:11.417 --> 36:12.984
Okay, but they were
both injected

36:13.019 --> 36:14.986
with different strains,
right?

36:15.021 --> 36:16.821
Still, Xavier was only
a beast for a day.

36:16.855 --> 36:18.656
Maybe his DNA
didn't have a chance

36:18.690 --> 36:20.792
to permanently mutate yet.

36:21.860 --> 36:23.094
Hey, don't look at me.

36:23.129 --> 36:25.063
I'm just making this crap up.

36:25.097 --> 36:27.465
All that matters is
he's normal now.

36:27.499 --> 36:29.467
Well, except
for his memory.

36:29.501 --> 36:31.001
But he's alive

36:31.036 --> 36:32.303
because you saved him

36:32.337 --> 36:33.938
and not just by using
your human side,

36:33.972 --> 36:35.440
both sides.

36:35.474 --> 36:38.142
And not by trying
to impress Cat either.

36:39.611 --> 36:40.845
You did it for you.

36:40.879 --> 36:43.147
Score one for
the good guys.

36:43.181 --> 36:45.482
Have a gummy worm.

36:47.452 --> 36:49.820
Or a few. Thanks.

36:49.854 --> 36:52.622
All right.

36:52.657 --> 36:54.624
Hey.

36:54.659 --> 36:57.061
Get some sleep, okay?

37:10.374 --> 37:12.108
Landon, you okay?

37:14.812 --> 37:16.179
You sick or something?

37:16.213 --> 37:18.547
No. I'm fine.

37:51.847 --> 37:53.048
Hey.

37:53.082 --> 37:54.516
Hey.

37:54.550 --> 37:57.052
I probably
should've called first,

37:57.086 --> 37:58.220
uh, but...

37:58.254 --> 37:59.587
we have to talk.

37:59.622 --> 38:02.057
Okay. Uh, hungry?

38:02.091 --> 38:04.526
No, thank you.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.360
Um,

38:06.395 --> 38:09.531
Vincent, this is really hard
for me,

38:09.565 --> 38:11.833
but now that Sam's
in jail,

38:11.867 --> 38:14.368
things need to change
between us.

38:14.403 --> 38:16.137
I'm with Gabe now.

38:17.205 --> 38:19.507
I know.

38:19.542 --> 38:21.275
And the problem is

38:21.309 --> 38:22.910
I can't move forward
with him

38:22.944 --> 38:25.546
unless you and I stop
seeing each other

38:25.580 --> 38:27.114
for a while,
even as friends.

38:27.149 --> 38:29.283
I completely understand.

38:32.054 --> 38:34.021
I don't want to hurt you.

38:34.056 --> 38:37.391
No, you deserve to be happy,
and I can't make you happy.

38:37.426 --> 38:39.392
No, that's not it.

38:39.427 --> 38:42.195
Catherine, I've made a
lot of mistakes. I know.

38:42.229 --> 38:43.396
We both have.

38:43.431 --> 38:45.231
And Gabe is a good guy.

38:45.266 --> 38:46.399
He is.

38:46.434 --> 38:48.702
He really, you know,
cares about you.

38:48.736 --> 38:50.871
He does.
 So I, uh...

38:50.905 --> 38:53.607
I completely understand.

38:53.641 --> 38:56.242
Good. I'm glad. Thank you.

38:56.277 --> 38:59.011
Good.

39:03.784 --> 39:05.751
Well, take care.

39:05.786 --> 39:07.387
