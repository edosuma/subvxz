00:10.677 --> 00:13.722
- Oh, my God.
This is just what I needed.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.015
Yes.

00:15.056 --> 00:18.059
- Not--not--
this is not for you.

00:19.769 --> 00:22.022
I just planned
a nice little guy's night

00:22.063 --> 00:23.523
for me and your dad.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.650
Charcuterie and pinot grig?

00:25.692 --> 00:28.236
That's sweet,
but you know my dad's

00:28.278 --> 00:31.322
more a Modelo and
gas station potato kind of guy.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.408
- No, I think you are wrong
about your dad.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.577
We had a real breakthrough
the other day.

00:35.618 --> 00:37.662
He hugged me.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.958
- Are you sure he wasn't trying
to steal your wallet?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.376
Yes, I am.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.045
He showed me that he doesn't
completely hate me,

00:45.086 --> 00:46.463
and that is a huge win.

00:46.504 --> 00:47.964
So I need to seize this moment.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.717
I'm gonna take our bromance
to the next level.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.219
- Oh, my God.
This is just what I needed.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.721
Thank you, George. Yeah.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.097
I tried to do, like,
the cheeses

00:56.139 --> 00:57.390
on the side that we could--

00:57.432 --> 00:59.392
- This piece of wood
is the perfect size

00:59.434 --> 01:03.104
to cover the shotgun hole
in my truck.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.190
She could have said
she was married.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.710
- Sandra Bullock is so good
in "Miss Congeniality"

01:25.752 --> 01:28.380
that I forgive her
for "The Blind Side"

01:31.174 --> 01:32.592
Sorry.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.344
I just keep thinking about
how it should be your dad

01:34.386 --> 01:37.472
under those Pure Retinol
Express Smoothing Eye Masks.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.934
- Look, I love that you love
this stuff.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.894
But if you want to spend time
with my dad,

01:42.936 --> 01:45.438
you have to find something
that he's into.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.232
Like yelling, "He's got a gun"

01:47.273 --> 01:49.484
when the grocery store line
is too long.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.238
Ayy.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.824
Ayy.

01:56.991 --> 01:59.202
Ayy.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.453
What's wrong?

02:00.495 --> 02:04.290
- We just lost our friend Jesse
to booze.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.668
- Oh, no.
Did he drink himself to death?

02:06.710 --> 02:08.378
No.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.463
He got sober.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.926
- He thinks he's better than us
because he stopped shaking

02:14.968 --> 02:17.303
and his wife took him back.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.056
So now we're short a player

02:20.098 --> 02:21.516
for our
fantasy baseball league.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.935
I swear, some people only
think of themselves!

02:25.520 --> 02:26.938
But what about Quinten?

02:26.980 --> 02:29.315
He likes sports and he never
thinks about himself.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.485
This is fantasy baseball,
Mayan,

02:32.527 --> 02:34.946
and none of my fantasies
include Quinten.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.827
Um, excuse me,

02:40.869 --> 02:42.912
could you give us a moment
while I confer

02:42.954 --> 02:44.247
with my associate?

02:45.540 --> 02:47.459
- Oh. Oh. Okay.
- Yeah.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.839
- We should let Quinten
in the league.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.549
- But he doesn't know anything
about baseball.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.343
Every time it comes up,
all he mentions

02:56.384 --> 02:58.970
is Madonna and Geena Davis.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.806
- Babe, wh--what are you doing?

03:01.848 --> 03:03.516
I don't know anything
about baseball.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.060
Other than there's
no crying in it,

03:05.101 --> 03:06.978
which is a nonstarter for me.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.689
- If you wanna bond
with my dad,

03:09.731 --> 03:11.566
this is it and I can help you.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.486
I know baseball
and I'm 50% George.

03:16.237 --> 03:18.573
- He got fired
from coaching T-ball.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.785
It'll be the easiest 20 bucks
we make.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.413
Why stop at 20?

03:26.956 --> 03:28.750
Okay, Faux DiMaggio.

03:30.835 --> 03:32.253
You're in.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.964
<i>[upbeat saxophone music]</i>

03:35.006 --> 03:38.218
- And that's how Prince Ben
and Princess JLo

03:38.259 --> 03:40.053
lived happily ever after.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.305
Oh. Again.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.934
- I can't believe
she took him back.

03:45.975 --> 03:48.436
- These fairy tales are crazy.
- [chuckles]

03:50.689 --> 03:52.148
The boys are here to draft.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.527
- I don't understand why
I couldn't use the moving cart.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.571
- Because that's for work
and this is pleasure.

03:58.613 --> 04:01.157
- Okay. Now put that keg
in the corner over there,

04:01.199 --> 04:03.076
or you're fired.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.911
[grunts]

04:04.953 --> 04:06.496
- You gonna come in or what,
Momo?

04:06.538 --> 04:08.248
- You can't enter a room
you're not invited into.

04:08.289 --> 04:10.125
It's bad luck.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.418
What are you, a vampire?

04:11.459 --> 04:12.961
<i>Ta loco.</i>Get in here.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.633
- Yo, I didn't know a star was
gonna be here.

You're "Don't take a chance"
Chance from the ads.

04:21.636 --> 04:24.848
- Grandpa, are your friends
showing up already drunk?

04:27.017 --> 04:28.476
Yeah, probably.

04:28.518 --> 04:32.272
But he's talking about
how I used your picture

04:32.313 --> 04:34.816
in one of my insurance ads.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.863
- When did I have crutches
and a neck brace?

04:42.073 --> 04:44.284
I photoshopped it.

04:44.325 --> 04:47.495
Makes you wanna buy insurance,
right?

04:47.537 --> 04:48.955
Nobody needs insurance.

04:48.997 --> 04:52.417
I've never had insurance,
and I'm doing just fine.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.627
You live in my room.

You mean the Marlins?

Oh, God.

No, I got you.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.985
Look, I picked up some stuff
to help you fit in.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.280
Now take off that hat
and put this on.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.199
Are you giving me a makeover?

05:24.240 --> 05:26.910
I feel like Anne Hathaway
in "The Princess Diaries."

05:28.036 --> 05:29.496
Don't talk about Anne,

05:29.537 --> 05:32.248
princesses, or diaries
in front of my dad.

05:32.290 --> 05:35.960
Now let me show you how
to be a down-ass fool.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.048
Sit your ass down, fool.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.429
No, you gotta manspread.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.430
- See?
- Oh.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.890
Like, you know.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.100
Hoh!

05:52.102 --> 05:54.396
They do this
to unstick everything.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.897
Yeah.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.441
- Oh.
- Yeah.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.443
Oh, works for us too.

06:01.653 --> 06:04.489
- This feels great.
What about baseball?

06:04.531 --> 06:06.199
Oh, I made you a cheat sheet.

06:06.241 --> 06:09.202
And I put it on a paper towel
so you can disguise it.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.995
- What if they ask me something
that's not on it?

06:11.037 --> 06:12.497
- Simple.
You just distract them

06:12.539 --> 06:14.916
by saying "Los Doyers."

06:16.584 --> 06:18.461
Are you saying "The Dodgers?"

06:18.503 --> 06:20.922
Yeah. "Los Doyers."

06:23.049 --> 06:26.177
- Am I allowed to say that
like that?

06:27.387 --> 06:29.556
- Yes.
Now take your cheat sheet

06:29.597 --> 06:31.057
and get out there, champ.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.143
Oh. I'm so nervous.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.728
This must be what
the players feel like

06:56.916 --> 06:58.501
- As commissioner
of the league,

I like keep everything equal
and fair.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.839
So I'ma draft first.

07:04.466 --> 07:07.218
I will take Juan Soto.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.762
All right. Oscar, you're up.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.139
I'm gonna take Miguel Vargas

from "Los Doyers."

07:14.225 --> 07:17.187
all: "Los Doyers."

"loose dough-ears?"

Come on, man. Pick a player.

07:30.909 --> 07:31.951
Okay.

Can I have that back, please?

- Sure.
I blasted it pretty good.

- Okay, come on, man.
Just pick a player

07:46.466 --> 07:48.510
Okay. Yeah. Um...

07:48.551 --> 07:50.553
I'm gonna pick--

Churro?

07:53.723 --> 07:56.601
Did you say Chourio?

07:56.643 --> 07:58.895
Jackson Chourio
from the Brewers?

07:58.937 --> 08:00.605
- Yes. That--that is a player.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.691
All right. Hey.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.609
That's a solid pick.
I was gonna pick him.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.319
Oh. No. Oh, I'm sorry.

08:06.361 --> 08:07.529
Uh, should I give him back?

08:07.570 --> 08:09.155
No, man.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.658
Screwing people over

08:11.700 --> 08:13.118
Oh. All right.

Well, then, I am gonna be

- His name is Quinten.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.214
Let's get some beers, eh?

08:26.256 --> 08:28.550

08:28.591 --> 08:31.761
of his sort of father-in-law,
being called by my real name.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.931
- Hey, Quinten, you want
to do the honors, man?

08:34.973 --> 08:36.391
Do the first keg stand.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.893
Wah! Okay. Oh.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.562
Okay, but pull my legs apart

08:40.603 --> 08:42.605
'cause I wanna manspread
while I do it.

Yeah! Yeah!

08:48.153 --> 08:49.738
Chug! Chug! Chug!

Chug! Chug! Chug!

08:53.616 --> 08:55.827
- Oh, damn.
You guys are having fun.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.204

08:59.622 --> 09:01.082
Hey, I got an idea.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.752
Let's everybody come back
tomorrow for some carne asada.

Oh, what should I make?

09:07.505 --> 09:10.008
Uh, yourself scarce.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.761
It's just for guys, Mayan.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.137
Guys only?

09:14.179 --> 09:15.722
I think Quinten has something
to say about that.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.098
Yes.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.600
I will be there.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.518
And some guac would
be nice too.

That's awful.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.448
You don't even know
how to boil corn.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.368
- And can you believe
they said no women allowed?

09:36.409 --> 09:39.287
I mean, what is this,
"The Little Rascals"?

09:39.329 --> 09:42.749
- I think it's better that
the men and women are separate.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.292
They can brag
about their penises.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.670
We can complain
about their penises.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.339
But we're a team.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.800
We should be out there bragging
about his penis together,

09:51.841 --> 09:53.677
as a family.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.638
- Couples in your generation
want to do everything together.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.140
It's sick.

10:00.058 --> 10:03.144
I think it's good that Quinten
is bonding with those guys.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.396
Or any guys.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.106
He can't always be
hanging out with you

10:06.147 --> 10:09.734
braiding hair
and painting toenails.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.319
He likes it.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.655
He said it reminds him of when
he did his mom's nails.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.824
Oh, my God. I hear myself.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.951
- Ooh, they are loving me
out there.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.244
You should have seen me.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.871
I chugged a whole beer--

we made fun of someone.

Well, I'm happy you're happy.

No. You've been served.

without asking me.

11:08.251 --> 11:11.755
My buddy Diego's mom's a lawyer

ground rule double?

12:52.856 --> 12:54.357
Uh, babe.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.092
[sighs]

20:17.133 --> 20:19.344
It's a fickle business.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.930
Enjoy the ride while it lasts,
kid.

- They fell in love
while he was sleeping.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.611
- Technically, wasn't he
in a coma?

20:36.653 --> 20:37.862
- You can still sleep when
you're in a coma.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.447
Shh.

20:40.490 --> 20:41.741
How am I supposed to learn

20:41.783 --> 20:43.576
if you don't let me
ask questions?

20:44.703 --> 20:46.204
I got you a cheat sheet.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.455
This is all you need to know

20:47.497 --> 20:49.582
about every
Sandra Bullock rom-com.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.460
Every plot is basically
the same.

20:52.502 --> 20:54.045
She doesn't get what she wants,

20:54.087 --> 20:56.756
but she always gets
what she needs.

20:56.798 --> 20:59.676
And if you get lost, just yell,
"Sandy B!"

20:59.718 --> 21:02.429
- Shh. I wanna know
what brother she chooses,

21:02.470 --> 21:05.390
the hot one or the hotter one.

21:05.432 --> 21:10.603
Well, we know that she might
not need what she wants,

21:10.645 --> 21:12.981
but need what she needs.

21:14.733 --> 21:16.818
What? That makes no sense.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.573
Sandy B!

21:21.614 --> 21:23.575
All: Sandy B!

21:23.616 --> 21:26.161
