You okay?

See what? See who?

JIM: We heard a voice
on the radio.

00:24.225 --> 00:27.015
He knew my name.
Knew what my wife
was doin' in the house.

00:27.015 --> 00:29.433
In the basement.
Jim...

00:29.735 --> 00:31.085
I think people
are watching us.

00:31.095 --> 00:33.075
We've gotta start
working together on this.

00:33.165 --> 00:34.095
I gotta go, Jim.

KRISTI:You were
on your way to rehab
and you ended up here.

00:38.355 --> 00:39.585
Did you take
anything from here?

00:39.625 --> 00:41.129
It was just a little
bit of morphine so I...

00:41.195 --> 00:41.535

under my skin,

00:58.685 --> 01:01.055
and it feels like
something's coming
for me now.

But you didn't, okay?

01:46.285 --> 01:47.935
I need to ask
you something.

01:48.535 --> 01:49.495
Yeah, of course.

01:51.525 --> 01:53.515
Do you have
any pregnancy tests?

01:59.985 --> 02:01.035
Are you sure?

02:01.975 --> 02:05.625
As sure as I can be,
given the circumstances.

anything to Ellis yet?

Uh, no, no, not...
not yet, I, uh...

02:14.965 --> 02:17.785
I know these
aren't the most
ideal conditions,

02:17.785 --> 02:21.505
but women have
been giving birth
for thousands of years.

02:21.985 --> 02:22.555

to guide them through.

Look, talk to Ellis,
the three of us can...

02:33.655 --> 02:34.705
I can't. I...

I don't want to say
anything to him yet.

02:47.521 --> 02:48.855

We should go.

KRISTI: Jesus.

03:44.895 --> 03:45.795
You really did it.

03:47.775 --> 03:48.825
You killed one of them.

03:50.935 --> 03:52.165
What do we do
with the body?

03:53.455 --> 03:54.415
We should burn it.

03:57.315 --> 03:58.365
We take it inside.

Tell me
you're joking.

04:01.635 --> 04:03.075
KRISTI: No,
he's right. This is...

04:03.075 --> 04:04.815
This is our chance
to learn about them.

04:05.325 --> 04:06.855
We could study them,
open them up,

04:06.885 --> 04:08.715
see what they look
like on the inside.

know if it's safe
to touch this thing!

to head back up
to Colony House.

04:36.065 --> 04:37.265
No, I wanna stay.

04:37.815 --> 04:39.935
Yeah, you do that,
we're gonna have
dozens of people

04:39.935 --> 04:42.545
comin' to check on you,
and we gotta keep this quiet.

04:43.415 --> 04:45.095
At least until
we have a chance
to get a look at it.

04:46.115 --> 04:48.657
Hey, uh, Kristi,
are you good
if we head back?

04:48.756 --> 04:50.765
I mean, yeah,
but you gotta
take it easy.

04:50.795 --> 04:52.535
You come back to me
immediately

04:52.535 --> 04:54.215
if you have any trouble
breathing, okay?

04:54.605 --> 04:57.095

and I'll check on you later.

can we please just stop

05:27.465 --> 05:29.055
and talk about
this for a second?

05:29.905 --> 05:31.045
Kenny, what is there
to talk about?

05:33.925 --> 05:37.825
You're about to
willingly bring something
evil into your home!

05:38.785 --> 05:40.045
Do you understand that?

05:40.525 --> 05:42.295
I do. I also understand

05:42.295 --> 05:44.185
that we may
never get this
opportunity again.

05:44.185 --> 05:45.055

about those people

with a master chef.

the secrets of the trade, huh?

10:14.825 --> 10:16.305

that's a good idea, buddy.

I could take him.

go up there anyway.

to Colony House.

Hey, Jim, I think
it's okay for them to go.

10:28.065 --> 10:30.765
Okay. Uh, can we talk
outside for a minute?

10:34.335 --> 10:35.865

pancakes, okay?

I don't know what's
going on with you...

10:54.555 --> 10:55.345
Excuse me?

10:55.365 --> 10:56.955
We have to be
a team here.

10:57.735 --> 10:59.805
So when I say no one
goes to Colony House

10:59.805 --> 11:01.585
and you immediately
undermine me,
it doesn't help.

11:01.685 --> 11:02.865
Okay, what...
what do you
wanna do?

11:03.845 --> 11:05.465
Do you wanna lock them
in the basement?

11:07.135 --> 11:09.565
Two days ago
you took Ethan
to confront the person

11:09.565 --> 11:11.305
that tried to kill him.

11:11.465 --> 11:11.965
That was different.

11:11.995 --> 11:14.065
No, it was you and I
accepting the fact

11:14.065 --> 11:17.485
that we can't just
lock them away until
we find a way home.

11:17.515 --> 11:18.985
You want them
sneaking out?

11:19.075 --> 11:20.725
Because that's
what'll happen.

11:20.905 --> 11:22.975
This way we know
where they're going,

11:23.005 --> 11:24.055
we know
they're together.

11:24.105 --> 11:26.725
I just don't want
our 9-year-old son

11:26.725 --> 11:29.575
hanging out with some
emotionally stunted freak

11:29.575 --> 11:31.895
who walks around town
with a gun in his lunch box.

11:31.895 --> 11:32.395
Wait, wait, wait. No.

11:32.395 --> 11:36.655
That emotionally stunted freak
saved your daughter's life

11:36.745 --> 11:37.915
and he saved mine.

11:37.925 --> 11:40.195
Or maybe that's what
they want you to think.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.175
I heard a voice
on the radio.

11:45.095 --> 11:46.295
(EXHALES)
Why is that
nothing for you?

11:46.325 --> 11:47.795
Because I think
you're wrong.

11:49.295 --> 11:51.725
I know you want
all this to make sense.

11:51.725 --> 11:54.335
I know you want there to
be a rational explanation,

11:54.335 --> 11:57.605
but if you had been
down in those tunnels,

11:57.605 --> 11:59.210
if you've seen what I saw...

11:59.310 --> 12:01.325
Or maybe that's what
they wanted you to see.

12:03.235 --> 12:03.865
Oh, God.

12:06.765 --> 12:07.485
(SIGHS)
Okay.

12:08.665 --> 12:09.665
Hmm.

12:11.115 --> 12:12.135
How did they do it?

12:13.055 --> 12:16.965
How did "they"
create monsters

12:16.965 --> 12:18.195
that come out
at night?

12:18.345 --> 12:21.525
Because I've seen
those things
up close, Jim.

12:21.915 --> 12:22.845
I've seen them.

12:25.395 --> 12:28.185
You're so sure
this voice you heard
on the radio

12:29.255 --> 12:31.865
is the answer
to all those
impossible things.

12:33.215 --> 12:36.605
Have you ever stopped
to wonder if that voice
was even a person?

12:36.755 --> 12:38.225
Of course
it's a person.

12:39.895 --> 12:41.365
What else do you
think it was?

12:41.785 --> 12:43.135
I don't know.

12:44.695 --> 12:47.635
And that is
fucking terrifying.

12:48.625 --> 12:51.685
You know what? But for now,
I'm gonna go back inside

12:51.925 --> 12:53.965
and have pancakes
with my children.

12:54.795 --> 12:56.385
You're welcome to
join us if you want.

12:56.962 --> 12:59.162
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

13:02.595 --> 13:04.062
(DOOR OPENING)

13:05.795 --> 13:06.995
(DOOR CLOSING)

13:09.795 --> 13:12.995
(BUZZING)

13:34.429 --> 13:35.695
KRISTI: Okay.

13:35.795 --> 13:37.262
BOYD: You got it?

13:38.375 --> 13:38.885
All right.

13:40.085 --> 13:43.025
Okay, so how's this work?

13:44.275 --> 13:45.011
What do you need?
What do you need?

13:45.455 --> 13:47.885
It looks like it has
some sort of rib cage,

13:48.665 --> 13:50.285
so we'll probably
need a saw.

13:50.465 --> 13:52.145
Okay, uh, there's
a few of those

13:52.145 --> 13:54.095
in the tool shed
by the bar.

13:55.515 --> 13:57.545
Ugh. Gloves wouldn't
be a bad idea either.

13:58.745 --> 14:00.935
All right. Hey, Kenny,
you think your mom has

14:00.935 --> 14:02.855
anything in storage
that we can use?

14:06.368 --> 14:07.401
Kenny?

14:07.501 --> 14:08.701
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

14:09.935 --> 14:12.365
You had worms
or something

14:12.545 --> 14:13.805
crawling underneath
your skin,

14:13.805 --> 14:17.495
and you put them
inside this thing
and now it's dead.

14:17.735 --> 14:18.455
Yeah?

14:19.685 --> 14:21.155
So what happened
to the worms?

14:22.805 --> 14:24.035
Huh?
Are they dead, too?

14:26.085 --> 14:27.385
What do you...
Excuse me.
(COUGHS)

14:28.435 --> 14:29.765
Mari! Hey!

14:31.815 --> 14:33.081
Hey, Mari.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.415
(RETCHES)

14:36.735 --> 14:37.465
Oh, honey. Hey.

14:37.465 --> 14:38.035
Come on, baby.
Come here.
Hey.

14:38.035 --> 14:39.655
(COUGHS) I'm sorry.
It's okay.

14:39.655 --> 14:41.055
Is she okay?
(COUGHS)

14:41.575 --> 14:42.715
She's going
through withdrawal.

14:46.445 --> 14:48.266
Uh, is there anything
we can...

14:48.365 --> 14:50.205
I need gloves and something
to cut through bone.

14:50.245 --> 14:51.365
I don't want
this thing down here

14:51.365 --> 14:52.415
any longer than
it needs to be,

14:52.415 --> 14:54.215
so let's just do it
and get it done, okay?

14:55.205 --> 14:55.955
Please.

14:59.585 --> 15:01.404
Hey, come on,
let's go.

15:01.504 --> 15:02.795
Let's get you
cleaned up, okay?

15:08.485 --> 15:10.495
I'll, uh... I'll go
down to the shed.

15:16.319 --> 15:19.085
(GRUNTS)

15:19.875 --> 15:20.415
Hey.

15:21.705 --> 15:24.985
Sorry about the flyby.
I was just fucking around.

15:25.005 --> 15:25.695
That's all right.

15:26.985 --> 15:28.335
You're pretty good
with that thing.

15:29.525 --> 15:31.695
Supposed to be
for my nephew's
birthday.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.815
Figured I'd get
my money's worth.

15:39.105 --> 15:39.805
Hey, I...

15:40.775 --> 15:44.625
I never thanked you
for what you did
the other day,

15:44.625 --> 15:46.125
helping out down
in the basement.

15:48.095 --> 15:48.925
Well, you're welcome.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.425
Though, seeing as
your wife wasn't
even down there

15:53.425 --> 15:54.535
it kinda seems
like you got

15:54.535 --> 15:56.245
those two other guys
killed for nothing.

15:58.285 --> 15:59.935
That feel good
just now saying that?

16:00.385 --> 16:02.125
Buddy, fuck off, okay?

16:02.455 --> 16:04.675
You said thank you.
You're welcome.

16:05.515 --> 16:06.625
What else
do you want from me?

16:08.205 --> 16:09.945
How much do you think
that thing can carry?

16:10.425 --> 16:11.565
What? Why?

16:12.225 --> 16:13.995
Take a walk with me.
I wanna show you something.

16:14.325 --> 16:14.895
Where?

16:15.405 --> 16:17.445
Just down the road,
outside town.

16:17.815 --> 16:19.965
Oh, you want me to help
find your dog, right?

16:20.505 --> 16:20.985
What?

16:21.795 --> 16:23.235
You sound like
one of those
fucking perverts

16:23.235 --> 16:24.495
that hang out
at playgrounds.

16:25.005 --> 16:26.325
What is wrong
with you?

16:28.465 --> 16:31.005
It's... Just leave me
alone, okay?

16:32.865 --> 16:35.985
What if I told you
that drone
might get you home

16:35.985 --> 16:37.725
in time for
your nephew's birthday?

16:50.035 --> 16:51.235
Did they move again?

16:53.335 --> 16:54.505
What are you
doing here?

16:55.255 --> 16:56.575
I came to see you.

16:56.995 --> 16:57.955
Go away.

16:59.275 --> 17:01.135
Why are you being
so mean to me?

17:02.365 --> 17:03.985
I thought
we were friends.

17:04.285 --> 17:05.604
We are friends.

17:06.215 --> 17:07.495
Doesn't feel like it.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.285
I'm trying
to protect you.

17:11.635 --> 17:12.324
It's just...

17:12.475 --> 17:15.505
It's safer for you
to stay away from me.

17:15.955 --> 17:16.945
Why?

17:18.265 --> 17:21.235
'Cause bad things
happen to my friends here.

17:22.675 --> 17:25.824
Well, what's the point
of being friends
if we can't be friends?

17:28.695 --> 17:29.235
Okay.

17:30.525 --> 17:31.215
Bye.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.595
The orange was dry.

17:41.065 --> 17:41.695
What?

17:43.085 --> 17:44.245
The markers
you gave me.

17:44.245 --> 17:46.525
The orange was dry.
It was a bad gift.

17:48.845 --> 17:49.595
Sorry.

17:55.225 --> 17:56.815
There's a lot of
measuring to do.

18:02.645 --> 18:06.245
I guess you can
help if you...
if you want.

18:13.445 --> 18:16.178
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

18:26.295 --> 18:27.455
They need you out there.

18:28.655 --> 18:29.375
They can wait.

18:32.295 --> 18:33.105
Just go.

18:33.465 --> 18:34.095
There.

18:35.355 --> 18:35.925
I'll be fine.

18:36.435 --> 18:37.665
You're shivering.
Here.

18:42.415 --> 18:43.645
Just do
what you need to do.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.915
(SHIVERING)

18:46.455 --> 18:47.895
Just try and drink
some water, okay?

18:49.422 --> 18:50.422
Yeah.

18:53.305 --> 18:54.673
I'll be right back.
Mmm-hmm.

19:01.505 --> 19:03.739
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

19:09.105 --> 19:10.305
She okay?

19:10.505 --> 19:12.965
Not great.
She's trying to sleep.

19:15.065 --> 19:15.395
Okay.

19:16.625 --> 19:17.765
Let me help you
with that.

19:18.575 --> 19:18.795
I'm...

19:20.725 --> 19:23.815
She's gonna be all right,
you know? She's got you.

19:30.515 --> 19:34.225
Uh, when I met her
she'd been sober
for almost a year.

19:36.025 --> 19:39.835
She worked so hard,
she was so proud.

19:42.325 --> 19:44.775
And then I disappeared.

19:44.805 --> 19:45.015
Hey.

19:45.645 --> 19:47.085
Hey, listen.

19:49.165 --> 19:51.565
This is not on you.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.755
I didn't even notice
she was going
through withdrawal

19:53.785 --> 19:55.885
because I was so caught up
in that fuckin' thing!

19:55.965 --> 19:57.925
I...
No. Kenny's right.

19:57.955 --> 20:00.955
We have no idea
what we're in for once
we open that thing up.

20:03.215 --> 20:03.755
I know.

20:05.075 --> 20:05.645
I know.

20:08.035 --> 20:08.785
Are you scared?

20:14.935 --> 20:15.935
Yeah.

20:19.555 --> 20:20.275
Yeah. Me, too.

20:24.665 --> 20:25.115
Okay.

20:28.128 --> 20:29.595
(KNOCKING)

20:29.595 --> 20:30.225
Yeah!

20:32.655 --> 20:34.815
You know it's a bar, right?
You don't have to knock.

20:36.915 --> 20:37.965
What are you doing?

20:41.755 --> 20:43.414
Well, you've arrived
at a fortuitous time.

20:43.513 --> 20:46.275
I think I figured out
how to make the alcohol

20:46.275 --> 20:47.835
not taste like
stomach acid.

20:51.015 --> 20:53.820
I needed a project
that wasn't terrifying.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.685
Hey, come on,
could you give me
a hand with this?

20:56.105 --> 20:58.085
No, I actually need
to ask you a question.

21:01.325 --> 21:03.545
When you found me in
the woods the other day

21:03.545 --> 21:07.145
I was rolling
on the ground
and screaming,

21:07.925 --> 21:09.545
you were not surprised.

21:11.545 --> 21:12.175
Why?

21:13.625 --> 21:15.685
I like you a lot better
when you're not
yelling at me.

21:15.985 --> 21:17.095
Oh, come on,
Jade. Just...

21:17.095 --> 21:18.865
Just answer
this question, please.

21:30.555 --> 21:32.715
Your husband found me
like that once before.

21:33.255 --> 21:34.545
He ever tell you that?

21:36.865 --> 21:38.335
No, no.

21:39.695 --> 21:41.875
Well, to be fair,
I wasn't entirely
forthcoming

21:41.875 --> 21:42.955
with the details.

21:45.565 --> 21:47.845
If I recall correctly,
I got up...

21:49.375 --> 21:51.685
and I told him to fuck off,
and then I ran away.

21:53.005 --> 21:53.935
What happened?

21:57.025 --> 22:01.285
I was being attacked
by a very angry
Civil War soldier.

22:04.345 --> 22:05.215
What?

22:06.065 --> 22:06.685
That's all you get.

22:07.345 --> 22:09.235
You want more,
you gotta help me
with this.

22:09.955 --> 22:11.635
And you're not
allowed to yell at me.

22:19.425 --> 22:22.905
You sent out a call for help,
someone actually answered,

22:22.905 --> 22:24.375
and no one's doing
anything about that?

22:24.945 --> 22:25.305
Yeah.

22:27.065 --> 22:29.865
And you think this is
one big mindfuck
designed to...

22:29.865 --> 22:33.345
designed to what?
See what we all do?

22:34.245 --> 22:37.365
Experiments have been
going on like this
for a long, long time.

22:38.805 --> 22:41.505
And when you see
the ones that finally
get declassified,

22:42.165 --> 22:43.695
you start to wonder
about the ones

22:43.695 --> 22:45.825
they still manage
to keep under wraps.

22:48.535 --> 22:49.465
Holy shit.

22:52.035 --> 22:53.015
That's where
you and your...

22:53.025 --> 22:53.535
Yeah.

22:55.435 --> 22:56.065
Fuck.

22:58.395 --> 22:58.995
Come on.

23:03.995 --> 23:05.161
(GRUNTS)

23:13.235 --> 23:14.555
The key is the antenna.

23:15.822 --> 23:18.515
We're gonna have
to get the signal up
over the treetops.

23:20.195 --> 23:22.295
That's why we put it
on the roof the last time.

23:23.275 --> 23:25.145
Yeah, if we can
strip this thing down,

23:25.145 --> 23:28.145
get it light enough,
this drone could
carry it up over...

23:28.245 --> 23:29.081
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.

23:29.180 --> 23:31.685
You can get the antenna
up as high as you want.
All right.

23:40.575 --> 23:42.165
This radio's pretty trashed.

23:42.325 --> 23:43.545
Oh, the radio's
not the problem.

23:43.545 --> 23:44.835
I can handle
the radio.

23:45.665 --> 23:46.595
Sure about that?

23:48.745 --> 23:51.305
Huh. You think
I'm crazy.

23:51.595 --> 23:52.745
I don't think
you're crazy.

23:54.675 --> 23:56.915
Shit, with everything
I've seen here so far,

23:57.549 --> 23:59.585
you're the first person
that's making any sense.

23:59.585 --> 24:02.375
I'm just wondering
why you haven't
asked yourself

24:02.375 --> 24:03.545
the obvious question.

24:04.395 --> 24:05.225
And what's that?

24:05.925 --> 24:08.495
Well, you think this place
is one big experiment, right?

24:09.495 --> 24:11.525
And it never occurred
to you that some
of the people here

24:11.525 --> 24:12.455
might be in on it?

24:13.775 --> 24:14.945
I mean,
they'd have to be.

24:15.305 --> 24:17.075
How else do you keep
the experiment on track?

24:23.075 --> 24:25.782
Jesus.
He stabbed you?

24:25.882 --> 24:29.045
Yeah, things have been
a little intense
around here lately.

24:29.855 --> 24:31.655
But you guys
are both okay?

24:32.285 --> 24:33.605
We're fine.
Yeah.

24:34.205 --> 24:35.465
Really, we're fine.

24:37.185 --> 24:37.545
Okay.

24:39.035 --> 24:41.075
Okay. Well, I'll let you
get some rest then.

24:41.655 --> 24:44.705
Hey. Come here.

24:46.755 --> 24:47.755
Mmm.

24:48.925 --> 24:49.795
I miss you guys.

24:50.905 --> 24:52.165
We miss you, too.

24:53.215 --> 24:54.445
ELLIS: You're always
welcome here.

24:55.495 --> 24:56.335
You know that, right?

24:56.755 --> 24:58.465
Yeah. I do.

24:58.885 --> 25:01.825
And you guys
are always welcome
at the Liu house.

25:01.949 --> 25:03.085
We'll keep that in mind.

25:03.883 --> 25:05.283
(GASPS)
Jeez! Sorry!

25:05.383 --> 25:06.783
Whoa! (LAUGHS)

25:06.955 --> 25:08.035
Leaving so soon?

25:08.135 --> 25:10.165
Uh, yeah. I gotta
make sure my brother's

25:10.165 --> 25:12.835
not building a spaceship
or something with Victor.

25:12.955 --> 25:14.395
DONNA: (LAUGHS)
Well, best get on that then.

25:14.395 --> 25:15.495
(CHUCKLES)
Bye.

25:15.495 --> 25:18.505
I thought you two
might be hungry.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.785
And I thought
we were in the middle
of a food shortage.

25:21.715 --> 25:23.815
We are in
the beginning stages

25:23.815 --> 25:26.245
of a minor
and temporary shortage.

25:27.455 --> 25:28.795
But you need to
get your strength up.

25:29.605 --> 25:33.295
Donna, I am fine.

25:34.405 --> 25:35.545
Really, I am.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.155
But it never should have
happened in the first place.

25:38.755 --> 25:39.925
I should've been here.

25:41.181 --> 25:42.115
I'm sorry.

25:42.115 --> 25:46.225
Well, I am so glad
that you have finally

25:46.225 --> 25:48.505
decided to apologize,
because another grown man

25:48.605 --> 25:51.035
losing his shit
and stabbing me
is clearly your fault.

25:51.245 --> 25:52.535
You know what
I mean, smartass.

25:55.985 --> 25:56.855
You did good.

25:58.585 --> 25:59.965
Getting him down
to the clinic.

26:02.115 --> 26:02.715
You did good.

26:14.825 --> 26:15.515
Hey, Julie?

26:16.685 --> 26:17.775
Oh, hey.

26:18.268 --> 26:20.495
You know, we have to
stop meeting like this.

26:22.535 --> 26:23.975
On the... on the porch.

26:24.515 --> 26:25.205
Oh.

26:25.582 --> 26:27.682
Yeah, right. Uh...

26:27.965 --> 26:28.445
What's up?

26:29.645 --> 26:31.925
You said if I ever
wanted to talk...

26:32.165 --> 26:33.875
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Of course.

26:34.855 --> 26:35.225
Uh...

26:37.615 --> 26:38.745
We have time
for a walk?

26:40.635 --> 26:40.935
Okay.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.954
These are all
I could find, so...

26:48.015 --> 26:48.145
Yeah.

26:49.455 --> 26:50.415
Yeah, they're fine.

26:51.495 --> 26:52.185
All right.

26:55.145 --> 26:55.745
BOYD: How can I help?

26:56.195 --> 26:57.245
KRISTI:
Catch me if I fall?

26:59.375 --> 27:01.095
Sorry, bad joke.

27:01.125 --> 27:03.845
I'm gonna
open up the shirt.

27:04.258 --> 27:05.592
Okay.

27:06.515 --> 27:07.190
I'll take, uh...

27:14.981 --> 27:15.948
(EXHALES)

27:16.235 --> 27:16.775
BOYD: Okay.

27:20.795 --> 27:21.335
Okay.

27:23.325 --> 27:26.225
I'm, uh, just gonna
make an incision
across the chest, okay?

27:27.905 --> 27:28.745
Here we go.

27:33.805 --> 27:34.771
Fuck!

27:34.955 --> 27:36.817
It-it-it's... it's fine.

27:36.916 --> 27:39.345
I-I-I just... I think
I just hit a nerve
or something.

27:39.345 --> 27:40.574
No, no, no, no,
no, no, stop.
Let's stop, stop.

27:40.574 --> 27:41.544
It's fine...
No, wait, wait,
just wait!

27:41.545 --> 27:45.135
Kenny! Jesus Christ!
Stop! All right?

27:45.135 --> 27:46.785
We shouldn't
be doing this!

27:47.115 --> 27:48.475
We should have
fucking burned it!

27:48.495 --> 27:49.605
We shouldn't be
doing this!

27:49.885 --> 27:51.945
You are fucking crazy!
Hey! Jesus Christ!

27:51.945 --> 27:52.425
Hey, hey!

27:52.425 --> 27:55.125
I got it.
I got it.

27:56.715 --> 27:57.075
Kenny?

28:00.775 --> 28:01.095
Kenny!

28:02.575 --> 28:03.675
Kenny, stop.

28:04.665 --> 28:05.475
Fucking stop!

28:06.825 --> 28:08.415
Are you really gonna
walk away right now?

28:11.145 --> 28:13.095
We never should have
brought that thing inside.

28:13.215 --> 28:14.895
It's dead.
How is it going
to hurt us?

28:15.165 --> 28:18.705
I'm not worried about
the monster, Kristi!

28:18.735 --> 28:20.505
I'm worried about the thing
that fucking killed it.

28:22.825 --> 28:24.195
Kristi, Boyd brought
something back with him.

28:24.195 --> 28:27.555
He had worms crawling
underneath his skin!

28:27.675 --> 28:29.325
He put them inside
the scariest thing

28:29.325 --> 28:30.615
I've ever seen
in my entire
goddamn life,

28:30.615 --> 28:32.145
and now that
scary thing is dead.

28:32.145 --> 28:33.285
But that's why we need to...

28:33.465 --> 28:35.355
Look, whatever
Boyd brought back

28:35.385 --> 28:37.065
is like a poison
to those things,

28:37.065 --> 28:38.565
and now
it's in his blood!

28:38.745 --> 28:40.785
If we could extract it
and use it,

28:40.815 --> 28:42.555
we may finally have
a way of fighting back!

28:42.555 --> 28:45.675
Or there is something
in there that'll kill you

28:46.005 --> 28:47.835
the moment you
open that thing up.

28:47.835 --> 28:49.035
How do you
not see that?

28:49.135 --> 28:50.925
Fine, I'm willing
to take that risk.

28:51.075 --> 28:54.135
Look, Kenny, all I do
here is put broken things
back together.

28:54.135 --> 28:55.935
This is a chance
to just finally...

28:57.725 --> 29:00.335
And yeah, I'm scared.
I'm fucking terrified,

29:00.335 --> 29:02.135
and that's why
I need you
in there with me!

29:03.655 --> 29:06.665
I can't do this without...

29:09.185 --> 29:10.655
We're in this together,
remember?

29:11.165 --> 29:12.215
You and me.

29:17.731 --> 29:18.798
(SCOFFS)

29:19.495 --> 29:20.185
No.

29:22.045 --> 29:22.945
No, we're not.

29:26.185 --> 29:27.055
Not anymore.

29:28.995 --> 29:30.335
Are you fucking
kidding me?

29:30.365 --> 29:33.215
No, I'm...
That's all...
I'm saying...

29:33.215 --> 29:34.515
(SCOFFS)

29:34.655 --> 29:35.855
Look, look,
it's okay.

29:36.725 --> 29:37.685
It's okay.

29:38.915 --> 29:40.415
I'm glad she's here.

29:41.585 --> 29:43.055
Truly, I am. I...

29:48.805 --> 29:50.205
Kristi, I love you.

29:53.115 --> 29:56.555
And all I want
is for you
to be happy, but...

29:56.655 --> 29:58.215
but I can't go in there

29:58.305 --> 30:00.735
and watch you
do something

30:00.735 --> 30:02.025
that might
get you killed.

30:02.025 --> 30:03.375
I just...
I can't do that!

30:05.785 --> 30:06.925
I just can't.

30:09.825 --> 30:10.725
I'm sorry.

30:11.825 --> 30:12.891
(GRUNTS)

30:12.991 --> 30:14.591
Kristi!

30:14.691 --> 30:15.891

30:30.658 --> 30:31.725
Kristi?

30:43.625 --> 30:44.691
Kristi?

30:56.391 --> 30:58.691
Kristi?
(DOOR CREAKING)

31:06.595 --> 31:06.945
No.

31:08.955 --> 31:10.735
No, no, no, no, no!

31:10.855 --> 31:13.288
Kristi! Kristi!

31:14.621 --> 31:16.088
You feeling okay?

31:17.505 --> 31:18.105
Where is it?

31:18.465 --> 31:19.035
What?

31:19.635 --> 31:22.275
The body,
the fucking body...

31:23.535 --> 31:23.895
Run.

31:24.735 --> 31:25.501
I ca...

31:25.601 --> 31:27.468
Marielle, run!
(COCKS GUN)

31:28.801 --> 31:33.268
(FIRES GUN)

31:33.368 --> 31:35.801

(BREATHES RAGGEDLY)

31:51.968 --> 31:53.801
(SIGHS)

31:58.285 --> 31:58.705
Donna.

31:59.635 --> 32:00.115
Hey.

32:03.905 --> 32:04.735
Are you all right?

32:06.405 --> 32:07.772
Plants keep dying.

32:09.825 --> 32:12.375
It's like they're
growing in poisoned soil.

32:14.985 --> 32:17.275
Boyd, all he ever
wanted was to find...

32:17.385 --> 32:18.718
I'm pregnant.

32:22.865 --> 32:24.605
Oh, sweetie!

32:24.805 --> 32:26.985
Oh, this is...

32:27.085 --> 32:30.575
Oh, I wish I coulda
seen Ellis's face
when he found out

32:30.575 --> 32:31.935
he was gonna be a dad.

32:32.005 --> 32:33.845
I haven't said
anything to him yet.

32:34.625 --> 32:35.135
Is he not...

32:35.165 --> 32:37.223
No, of course he is.
Um...

32:42.495 --> 32:44.755
(EXHALES)
Donna, I was told
I can't have kids.

32:47.075 --> 32:49.295
What's happening right now
is medically impossible.

32:53.309 --> 32:54.442
(EXHALES)

32:55.195 --> 32:56.845
And all I can think

32:57.675 --> 33:02.825
is what if this place is
trying to torture me?

33:04.495 --> 33:05.395
Mock me?

33:05.995 --> 33:08.005
Like those things
that come at night!

33:08.005 --> 33:09.255
The way they smile at us.

33:09.265 --> 33:10.855
What if this is
just another...

33:11.065 --> 33:14.698
(LAUGHING)

33:15.145 --> 33:16.075
What's happening?

33:16.525 --> 33:19.585
I'm standing here thinking
I am at the end of the line,

33:19.585 --> 33:22.375
that everything I thought
about this place was...

33:25.145 --> 33:30.515
We have seen so much
unbelievable shit

33:30.515 --> 33:31.655
in this place.

33:32.955 --> 33:34.715
Roads that
lead nowhere.

33:35.585 --> 33:37.505
Monsters that
come from the dark.

33:37.535 --> 33:38.795
According to Boyd,

33:38.885 --> 33:43.265
there are evil fucking trees
that trap you in dungeons!

33:45.035 --> 33:45.785
Don't ask.

33:48.455 --> 33:49.475
The point is...

33:51.655 --> 33:55.735
we have seen
a lot of horrible,

33:55.735 --> 33:58.075
impossible shit here.

33:59.765 --> 34:02.915
So we just assume
that anything impossible

34:02.915 --> 34:05.165
that happens here
is bad.

34:06.855 --> 34:08.045
But look at you!

34:10.375 --> 34:14.515
Sweetie, you met
the love of your life

34:14.515 --> 34:17.125
in the middle of your worst
fucking nightmare.

34:17.785 --> 34:19.704
You're gonna
have a baby

34:19.704 --> 34:22.315
that you were told
you could never have!

34:22.345 --> 34:25.644
That sounds
like a pretty good
impossible to me!

34:28.555 --> 34:30.474
Donna, it's impossible...
Oh, what?

34:30.474 --> 34:33.655
You're gonna
sit here and tell me
with all you've seen

34:33.655 --> 34:36.025
that you can't
wrap your head
around a miracle?

34:37.595 --> 34:40.744
Because a miracle
is just the other side
of a nightmare.

34:45.204 --> 34:46.375
What if you're wrong?

34:50.954 --> 34:53.055
I've got a different
question for you.

34:54.434 --> 34:56.055
What if I'm right?

34:58.575 --> 34:59.295
There we go.

34:59.325 --> 35:02.565
So first it was the guy
crushed by the rock
in the root cellar.

35:03.345 --> 35:06.975
He was stuffed inside
that giant armoire
in the back.

35:09.015 --> 35:10.095
And then...

35:12.075 --> 35:13.755
And then it was
the Civil War soldiers,

35:14.085 --> 35:16.335
and then
the other night,
Christopher,

35:16.605 --> 35:19.245
which was easily
the creepiest
fucking thing

35:19.245 --> 35:20.715
I've ever experienced
in my life.

35:21.465 --> 35:23.175
Wait, Christopher?

35:25.595 --> 35:26.375
Oh, yeah.

35:27.885 --> 35:28.485
Oh, yeah.

35:31.625 --> 35:33.435
Christopher's the guy
holding the journal.

35:34.375 --> 35:36.345
And you see that kid
in the background?

35:38.645 --> 35:39.635
Yeah, that's Victor.

35:41.755 --> 35:44.065
Wow, you caught that
a lot quicker than I did.

35:47.515 --> 35:48.655
(EXHALES) Okay, so...

35:52.405 --> 35:54.775
For you, what you see
is different every time?

35:56.395 --> 35:58.225
Yeah, I mean,
except for the symbol.

35:58.305 --> 35:59.335
Why? What do you see?

36:03.239 --> 36:05.005
I just see children.

36:05.975 --> 36:07.985
What, like...
like, little kids?

36:10.075 --> 36:10.465
Yeah.

36:11.125 --> 36:11.695
Yeah, but...

36:14.345 --> 36:15.935
they're fucking terrifying.

36:20.025 --> 36:24.155
I thought
I was losing my mind
or I was being punished.

36:24.905 --> 36:25.625
Punished for what?

36:30.735 --> 36:31.425
Well, my...

36:34.015 --> 36:37.405
My son Thomas
was a few months old
when he died, so...

36:39.382 --> 36:40.749
You know.

36:43.185 --> 36:43.515
Fuck.

36:50.215 --> 36:51.205
God, I'm so sorry.

36:57.748 --> 36:59.715
Well, look, I mean,
the good news is

36:59.805 --> 37:01.365
you're not
being punished.

37:02.125 --> 37:04.105
Maybe this is just
a fucked-up place

37:05.035 --> 37:06.685
where scary shit
happens,

37:08.795 --> 37:09.965
and there's
no explanation why.

37:11.315 --> 37:11.885
Yeah.

37:16.275 --> 37:17.025
(EXHALES)
I'm gonna go home.

37:21.085 --> 37:22.075
I appreciate the help.

37:27.605 --> 37:30.055
Wait, is this the symbol
you were talking about?

37:30.835 --> 37:32.638
Yeah, that's, uh,

37:32.737 --> 37:34.675
Christopher's
incel book of crazy.

37:36.025 --> 37:37.165
I've seen this.

37:38.515 --> 37:40.345
Yeah? Like in a vision
or something?

37:40.445 --> 37:40.845
No.

37:42.805 --> 37:44.785
No, on the walls
in the tunnels.

37:49.518 --> 37:51.085
What the fuck?

37:51.085 --> 37:52.075
What tunnels?

37:55.975 --> 37:57.295
How many times
we have to do this?
(SHUSHES)

37:59.065 --> 37:59.545
A lot.

38:01.055 --> 38:02.485
'Cause we have
to be thorough.

38:02.585 --> 38:03.685
We have to be sure.

38:08.675 --> 38:10.515
They're losing
their leaves.

38:13.405 --> 38:13.885
What?

38:15.825 --> 38:16.815
The trees.

38:19.845 --> 38:20.505
So?

38:22.035 --> 38:23.235
That happens
every year.

38:23.768 --> 38:25.068
Oh, not here.

38:25.515 --> 38:27.015
It's always
the same here.

38:29.235 --> 38:29.775
Oh.

38:30.502 --> 38:31.569
Mm.

38:31.905 --> 38:33.855
Is it bad that they're
losing their leaves?

38:34.105 --> 38:37.545
When things change here,
it's usually bad.

38:39.465 --> 38:41.385
Well, if it's never
happened before,

38:41.415 --> 38:42.615
maybe it's good.

38:46.482 --> 38:48.848
(EXHALES) Oh.

38:50.885 --> 38:51.545
Almost got it.

38:53.585 --> 38:55.145
There.
There you go.

38:55.451 --> 38:56.818
(EXHALES)

38:59.575 --> 39:00.025
Okay.

39:01.465 --> 39:02.855
Now we have to
remove the sternum.

39:02.875 --> 39:03.295
Right.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

39:05.995 --> 39:06.445

39:21.195 --> 39:22.905
Okay, on
the count of three.

39:22.935 --> 39:23.505
Okay.

39:24.705 --> 39:25.865
Hold that head
steady, okay?

39:25.965 --> 39:29.505
Uh-huh.
One, two, three.

39:29.732 --> 39:32.499
(BOYD AND KRISTI GRUNTING)

(SQUISHING)

39:37.095 --> 39:37.905
What the fuck?

39:39.195 --> 39:40.305
What's wrong?
What is it?

39:41.355 --> 39:42.255
It's human.

39:43.535 --> 39:45.105
I mean, at least
it-it-it was.

39:45.125 --> 39:47.385
It's got the exact
same anatomy.

39:48.105 --> 39:50.985
There are the lungs.
The heart. Liver.

39:50.985 --> 39:53.355
But they're... shriveled.

39:54.615 --> 39:55.395
Desiccated.

39:55.395 --> 39:57.735
It's like some shit
that you see at a museum.

39:57.765 --> 39:59.085
BOYD: Hey, hey,
look, slow down.

39:59.085 --> 40:01.065
Just talk...
just talk to me.
Just...

40:01.065 --> 40:02.895
It's supposed to
be in the blood.

40:02.925 --> 40:04.335
"My blood
is your blood,"

40:04.335 --> 40:05.865
that's what you
said to it, right?

40:05.895 --> 40:07.035
Right. I... Right.

40:07.035 --> 40:08.850
But maybe their blood
is different than ours.

40:08.950 --> 40:10.935
KENNY: Yeah, right.
This thing is bone dry inside.

40:10.935 --> 40:13.275
There's... There's...
There's no fluid,
there's no lymph,

40:13.905 --> 40:15.405
there's...
there's nothing...
Hey, it's okay...

40:15.405 --> 40:16.735
No, it's not okay!

40:16.755 --> 40:18.265
This was our chance.

40:18.365 --> 40:21.285
This, this couldn't have
been for nothing, okay?

40:21.705 --> 40:25.234
There's gotta be
something in here.

40:25.334 --> 40:27.455
Gotta be something
in here.

40:29.455 --> 40:29.975
There's gotta be something.

40:29.975 --> 40:30.475
Shit. There's gotta
be something in here.

40:30.475 --> 40:32.641
There's gotta be
something in here.

40:33.184 --> 40:35.145
Come on, come on.
Aw, hey, be careful.

40:35.145 --> 40:36.412
Piece of shit.

40:36.412 --> 40:40.178
You fucking,
fucking piece of shit.

40:40.250 --> 40:42.784
Okay.
Fucking! Fuck! Fuck!

40:42.884 --> 40:45.050
Fuckin' piece of shit!
Okay. Stop! Stop!

40:45.795 --> 40:47.055
Kristi, hey, hey! Stop!

40:48.465 --> 40:49.875
What is that?
What's that stuff?

40:55.295 --> 40:56.645
That's the gallbladder.

40:57.845 --> 40:58.835
That's, um...

40:59.645 --> 41:00.485
That's bile.

41:01.385 --> 41:04.835
It's bile. That's...
it's good, right?
It's liquid.

41:05.265 --> 41:07.055
That might be something
we can use, right?

41:08.135 --> 41:09.425
Yeah, maybe,
it's something.

41:10.145 --> 41:12.425
Maybe? You're goddamn
right that's something.

41:14.975 --> 41:16.175
(CHUCKLES)
Bile is something.

41:16.175 --> 41:18.215
Bile is some... Hey, yo.
Could you get me one of...

41:18.315 --> 41:19.805
Yeah.
the droppers
so that we can...

41:19.835 --> 41:22.235
we can collect it.
Look, yo, you did good.

41:22.595 --> 41:23.525
You did great.

41:26.035 --> 41:27.295
Wait, what do you
mean he killed it?

41:28.045 --> 41:30.715
I'm telling you,
he went outside
and did something

41:30.805 --> 41:32.485
and the thing
started screaming.

41:35.505 --> 41:37.295
When we went
out this morning,
it was dead.

41:40.145 --> 41:40.895
Jesus.

41:41.585 --> 41:42.695
You can't tell anyone.

41:42.725 --> 41:43.865
Not even
your parents.

41:44.675 --> 41:45.035
Why?

41:45.755 --> 41:47.975
I don't know.
Boyd said he doesn't
want anyone to know yet,

41:47.975 --> 41:50.315
and I really don't want him
pissed at me, so please...

41:50.345 --> 41:53.135
Okay, okay, okay.
I won't say anything,
I promise.

41:55.185 --> 41:56.775
Look, this is
a good thing.

41:57.195 --> 41:58.665
I mean,
if we can hurt them?

41:58.665 --> 41:59.805
If we can kill them?

42:01.545 --> 42:03.225
Everybody here
is gonna be
a whole lot safer.

42:04.045 --> 42:04.605
I know.

42:05.985 --> 42:06.825
So why are you upset?

42:10.485 --> 42:11.745
You know
that dream I had?

42:13.505 --> 42:14.285
On the bus?

42:15.245 --> 42:15.815
Yeah.

42:16.745 --> 42:19.475
I can't shake
this feeling

42:19.475 --> 42:21.665
like there's something
I'm supposed to remember.

42:21.665 --> 42:22.775
Something that...

42:27.855 --> 42:30.525
When I seen that thing
lying there in the dirt
this morning,

42:31.245 --> 42:32.715
it was like I could...

42:33.735 --> 42:35.235
it was right there.

42:35.235 --> 42:36.075
And I...

42:37.185 --> 42:39.065
It was like before
I could move my head,
it was gone.

42:39.075 --> 42:39.515
And I...

42:39.515 --> 42:43.845
I don't know if
what I'm supposed to
remember is real

42:44.985 --> 42:47.505
or if my mind is just
so messed up that...

42:47.505 --> 42:48.538
No, no.

42:50.895 --> 42:52.115
Everything about this
is crazy.

42:54.045 --> 42:54.575
I get it.

42:57.005 --> 42:59.435
This pl...
this place,
it's like,

43:01.115 --> 43:02.525
as soon as
you start to think

43:03.275 --> 43:05.105
"You know,
maybe today
I won't go insane,"

43:06.275 --> 43:07.865
something new
comes along
and it's like,

43:07.865 --> 43:09.755
"Hey, wait till
you see this."

43:12.105 --> 43:12.795
We all go through it.

43:14.295 --> 43:15.315
You seem pretty together.

43:16.905 --> 43:17.715
Seriously?
(CHUCKLES)

43:19.215 --> 43:21.255
You must be in
pretty bad shape then.

43:24.405 --> 43:25.875
I do have this
little trick though,

43:27.025 --> 43:28.785
for when things really
start to get to me.

43:29.558 --> 43:30.792
What's that?

43:33.125 --> 43:34.515
I fill up the bathtub,

43:35.205 --> 43:36.825
and I sink down just enough

43:36.825 --> 43:38.895
so that the water
is level with my ears.

43:40.275 --> 43:41.595
And the sound is like

43:42.465 --> 43:43.755
when you're standing
by the ocean.

43:45.284 --> 43:47.385
And I just sit like that
for a while and I breathe.

43:49.585 --> 43:50.335
It's peaceful.

43:51.575 --> 43:52.805
I don't take baths.

43:52.895 --> 43:55.115
Okay, well then,
I don't know
how to help you.

44:28.891 --> 44:31.591
Yeah. I am.

44:34.245 --> 44:35.805
There's something
I need to tell you.

44:50.755 --> 44:51.505
Big day.

44:53.215 --> 44:55.345
Yeah, it was.

44:57.295 --> 44:58.915
You really think
injecting them
with that stuff's

44:58.915 --> 44:59.665
gonna kill them?

45:01.825 --> 45:03.655
Honestly, I got
no fucking idea.

45:04.558 --> 45:06.235
It's the best chance
we got.

45:08.105 --> 45:09.555
How are we even
gonna test it?

45:13.215 --> 45:14.175
I tell you what.

45:14.925 --> 45:16.845
Let's make that
a problem for tomorrow.

45:20.325 --> 45:21.492
I should get home.

you know...

that badge back...

45:40.015 --> 45:40.585
I'll see you around.

45:43.825 --> 45:44.245
Yeah.

46:05.375 --> 46:06.185
How'd it go?

46:09.325 --> 46:10.345
I don't really know yet.

46:13.344 --> 46:14.845
I guess we'll
have to wait and see.

46:16.944 --> 46:18.310
How are you?

46:20.307 --> 46:21.695

Oh, no.

What was it about?

46:28.295 --> 46:32.615

the basement
came alive, and...

a music box?

giving me his nightmares.

talk to him about that.
