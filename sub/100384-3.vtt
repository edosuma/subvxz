WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.537
Ride along with the heroes
of 9-1-1 Lone Star.

00:03.571 --> 00:04.572
Let's show 'em what we got!

00:04.605 --> 00:06.307
See all-new episodes
Mondays.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.008
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.042 --> 00:10.244
Prodigal Son, 9-1-1
and Deputy.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.912
You need three things
to do this job--

00:11.945 --> 00:14.348
a badge, a gun
and what's in your heart.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.749
ANNOUNCER: Only on Fox.

00:25.893 --> 00:28.562
Hold on, Derek!
Help is on the way!

00:28.596 --> 00:29.730
(tense music)

00:29.763 --> 00:31.765
(gasping)

00:31.799 --> 00:33.867
Kenny!
(gasping)

00:33.901 --> 00:36.870
(sirens blaring)

00:36.904 --> 00:40.341
*

00:40.374 --> 00:43.177
How the hell does a kid end up
getting stuck in a grain silo

00:43.211 --> 00:44.512
50 feet above the ground?

00:44.545 --> 00:46.013
It's called walking the grain.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.349
People go up into the silo
and they stomp around

00:48.382 --> 00:49.783
on the corn
'cause it's a cheap way

00:49.817 --> 00:51.185
to dislodge it from the drain.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.753
Sounds like you've run a few
of these, Judd.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.922
Yeah, we lose a few people
a year to them down here.

00:54.955 --> 00:55.956
JUDD: You get that much
grain together,

00:55.989 --> 00:57.225
it's like quicksand.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.692
So if he's already up
to his chest,

00:58.726 --> 00:59.860
how long do we have
to get him out?

00:59.893 --> 01:01.395
Ten minutes at the most,

01:01.429 --> 01:02.730
but that depends
on the air pocket,

01:02.763 --> 01:04.265
but you also can't
pull him out too fast

01:04.298 --> 01:05.433
or you'll just rip him in half.

01:05.466 --> 01:06.934
But i-it's corn.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.402
Yeah, it's corn.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.704
It weighs 1,200 pounds
per cubic yard.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.473
It's like having
four refrigerators

01:12.506 --> 01:14.142
on top of every part
of your body.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.976
OWEN: All right,
here's the deal.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.278
When we get there,

01:17.311 --> 01:18.812
Judd's gonna run the call,
all right?

01:18.846 --> 01:20.248
OWEN: You do what he says
when he says it.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.149
-Copy that.
-TK: Copy that.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.450
Copy that.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.319
(sirens wailing)

01:25.353 --> 01:30.891
*

01:30.924 --> 01:32.460
All right,
let's raise the area!

01:32.493 --> 01:34.928
Everybody with high-angle
training goes up!

01:34.962 --> 01:37.097
Let's get this kid out of here!

01:37.131 --> 01:38.832
-(machine whirring)
-(beeping)

01:38.866 --> 01:39.800
JUDD: All right,
listen up, y'all!

01:39.833 --> 01:41.169
This is what we're gonna do!

01:41.202 --> 01:42.970
You get in there,
you put your platform down.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.438
You stay put!

01:44.472 --> 01:46.940
One false step could cause
an air pocket.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.410
JUDD: Nobody's feet touches
the corn!

01:49.443 --> 01:50.811
Copy that.

01:50.844 --> 01:57.651
*

02:01.054 --> 02:02.490
I got eyes on him, Cap.

02:02.523 --> 02:05.125
Hey, try to stay relaxed, okay?
Stay calm.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.327
JUDD: Don't struggle.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.295
We're gonna get you
out of there.

02:07.328 --> 02:11.699
*

02:11.732 --> 02:14.268
JUDD: Remember,
nobody steps on corn!

02:14.302 --> 02:15.669
Hey, pass one of these down!

02:15.703 --> 02:22.310
*

02:22.343 --> 02:23.877
Please, hurry!

02:23.911 --> 02:27.781
*

02:27.815 --> 02:29.217
PAUL: Got it.
Got hands on.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.318
All right, Marjan.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.719
Hey, give me that horse collar.

02:31.752 --> 02:32.553
-MARJAN: Copy that.
-JUDD: Yep.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.987
Harness flying in.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.124
All right, partner.
Okay?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.392
JUDD: We're gonna get you out
of here.

02:38.426 --> 02:39.960
You got a lot of pressure
on your chest right now.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.295
You've gotta try to relax.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.297
Hard to breathe!
(gasps)

02:43.331 --> 02:44.565
It's gonna be okay.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.833
Tighten that right now.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.869
*

02:48.902 --> 02:50.338
-Hold that one right there.
-MARJAN: Watch that rope.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.339
JUDD: All right,
got another coming in.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.373
Putting it behind you.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.342
Check your elbows, kid.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.076
JUDD: We're gonna get these
around you to form a seal

02:56.109 --> 02:58.178
and then suck out the corn
to relieve the pressure.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.080
You gotta go around.
You good?

03:00.113 --> 03:01.515
There you go.
Oh, you got him.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.483
We're losing him.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.851
Come on, we gotta go.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.152
All right, hey,
we're gonna drop this in.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.487
We're gonna vacuum
this out around you.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.921
You better watch your arms.
Just keep your head up.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.490
Just relax if you can.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.691
-JUDD: All right, breathing?
-PAUL: Okay.

03:10.724 --> 03:11.692
Yeah.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.093
TK, you're up.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.061
Just make sure that
you don't let him fall.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.263
I got it.
I got it.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.232
Let's go.
Come on.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.533
-(grunts)
-JUDD: Do it.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.436
-Go, go, go.
-JUDD: Do it.

03:22.470 --> 03:23.604
JUDD: Okay, Derek,

03:23.637 --> 03:25.439
he's gonna start
the suction rig.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.375
We're almost done.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.876
PAUL: Okay, let's go.
There you go.

03:28.909 --> 03:29.943
JUDD: Oh, there it is!

03:29.977 --> 03:31.512
-TK: Hey, hey!
-PAUL: Yeah.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.714
Gonna get you out of here.
All right, buddy?

03:33.747 --> 03:37.551
(machine whirring)

03:37.585 --> 03:39.253
-Talk to me.
-JUDD: Making progress, Cap.

03:39.287 --> 03:41.188
Stand by.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.356
-All right.
-TK: All right.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.224
-Whoo!
-(Paul laughing)

03:44.258 --> 03:45.893
JUDD: Let's go.

03:45.926 --> 03:46.960
Come on, Marjany.

03:46.994 --> 03:47.895
PAUL: Move your arm
over here, kid.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.196
PAUL: Make that flow.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.130
MATEO: Don't get too close,
Marjan.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.232
-(loud rattling)
-(all shouting)

03:52.266 --> 03:54.368
What was that?

03:54.402 --> 03:56.036
Hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:56.069 --> 03:57.371
-My line snapped.
-JUDD: Marjan, Marjan!

03:57.405 --> 03:58.806
Hold on, hold on.
Do not struggle!

03:58.839 --> 04:00.774
JUDD: Don't struggle!
Hold still!

04:00.808 --> 04:02.710
(grain sifting)

04:02.743 --> 04:04.545
-JUDD: Whoa!
-Marjan!

04:04.578 --> 04:05.946
Get back!
Get everybody!

04:05.979 --> 04:08.115
JUDD: Get to the sides!
Go, go, go!

04:08.148 --> 04:10.384
-TK: Marjan!
-What am I supposed to do?

04:10.418 --> 04:12.119
-MARJAN: I'm sinking!
-Marjan!

04:12.152 --> 04:13.086
-TK: Grab my hand!
-Judd!

04:13.120 --> 04:15.589
(TK grunting)

04:15.623 --> 04:17.591
-What am I supposed to do?
-TK: Grab my hand, Mar--

04:17.625 --> 04:18.726
(both shouting)

04:18.759 --> 04:19.893
JUDD: TK, don't!
Hey!

04:19.927 --> 04:21.495
-I can get to her!
-TK, don't!

04:21.529 --> 04:23.130
-That's an order!
-(Marjan screams)

04:23.163 --> 04:25.098
-Marjan!
-TK, no, no!

04:25.132 --> 04:28.068
(TK grunting)

04:28.101 --> 04:29.837
Oh, God!

04:29.870 --> 04:32.673
(TK grunting)

04:32.706 --> 04:33.907
JUDD: TK, don't!
Let go!

04:33.941 --> 04:36.477
-JUDD: No, no, no, no, no, no!
-TK!

04:36.510 --> 04:37.645
-JUDD: No!
-PAUL: Oh!

04:37.678 --> 04:39.246
Captain Strand,
they went down!

04:39.279 --> 04:41.148
-Who's going down?
-JUDD: TK and Marjan!

04:41.181 --> 04:42.149
Cut it open now!

04:42.182 --> 04:47.988
*

04:48.021 --> 04:49.957
-What's going on?
-Derek, listen to me!

04:49.990 --> 04:51.959
When I say "now,"

04:51.992 --> 04:53.427
take a deep breath
and let go of that harness.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.962
What?

04:54.995 --> 04:56.664
Just do it or you'll be
torn apart.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.966
Okay, the only way out
for you now is down.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.468
OWEN: It's open,
it's open!

05:00.501 --> 05:01.969
Take a deep breath
and go now!

05:02.002 --> 05:03.637
(Derek gasps)

05:03.671 --> 05:05.105
(metal thuds)

05:05.138 --> 05:07.307
MAN: Whoa, look at that.

05:07.341 --> 05:10.210
Holy smokes.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.480
-MAN: You see that?
-MAN: You think they're okay?

05:12.513 --> 05:14.482
(grunts)

05:14.515 --> 05:17.485
-(TK coughing)
-OWEN: TK!

05:17.518 --> 05:19.520
-You okay?
-TK: I'm good.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.654
Where's Marjan?

05:20.688 --> 05:25.626
(gasping)

05:25.659 --> 05:27.327
Wow.

05:27.361 --> 05:30.698
(upbeat music)

05:30.731 --> 05:32.900
Oh, damn.
(grunts)

05:32.933 --> 05:34.334
-(Owen grunts)
-MARJAN: Oh.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.236
OWEN: Form a wall!

05:36.269 --> 05:39.239
(dramatic music)

05:39.272 --> 05:46.079
*

06:05.966 --> 06:07.835
You don't think anyone
caught that on video

06:07.868 --> 06:09.369
when my hijab came off?

06:09.403 --> 06:10.404
Oh, yeah.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.039
This is gonna be epic.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.543
Epic disaster.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.545
*

06:17.578 --> 06:19.880
(horn honking)

06:19.913 --> 06:22.883
(beeping)

06:22.916 --> 06:25.553
(engine rumbling)

06:27.555 --> 06:29.690
Just grinning like
the butcher's dog, huh?

06:29.723 --> 06:31.892
I don't even know
what that means,

06:31.925 --> 06:33.961
and I do not know what
your deal is right now.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.263
My deal is that you disobeyed
a direct order

06:36.296 --> 06:37.297
back there at the silo.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.433
A direct order?
You're not my boss.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.134
You're damn right I was
the second the Cap

06:41.168 --> 06:42.536
put me in charge of that team.

06:42.570 --> 06:43.471
I was just following
my instincts.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.872
Your instincts?
(stammers)

06:44.905 --> 06:46.474
Based on all of your, uh,

06:46.507 --> 06:48.576
silo rescue experience
at Times Square?

06:48.609 --> 06:49.910
I'm not doing this with you,
all right?

06:49.943 --> 06:51.545
Well, that must be nice
that you get to move

06:51.579 --> 06:52.980
right to the front of the line
while everybody else

06:53.013 --> 06:54.448
who deserves a shot--

06:54.482 --> 06:55.949
You don't know
the first thing about me, dude.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.486
No, man, you must have been
killing it in New York City

06:58.519 --> 06:59.987
that you got
to follow Daddy down here

07:00.020 --> 07:00.988
at the drop of a hat.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.990
Seriously, Judd,
back off.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.492
Or what, pretty boy?

07:04.525 --> 07:06.259
Are you gonna go
and tell your daddy?

07:06.293 --> 07:08.462
You gonna say,
"Judd's hurting my feelings?"

07:08.496 --> 07:10.263
Nobody in New York
had the balls

07:10.297 --> 07:12.833
to tell the coach's kid
that his crap stinks.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.503
(tense music)

07:15.536 --> 07:18.105
PAUL: Hey!
Knock it off.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.407
Knock it off!
What the hell is going on?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.909
We are having a conversation.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.945
Yeah, with a bunch
of exclamation points.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.647
You good?

07:26.680 --> 07:28.015
We're great.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.618
(dramatic music)

07:30.651 --> 07:32.653
What you doing, man?

07:32.686 --> 07:33.654
-(sighs)
-(neck cracks)

07:40.494 --> 07:45.098
(motorcycle engines revving)

07:45.132 --> 07:47.000
You sure you're in
the right place, man?

07:47.034 --> 07:49.002
Yeah, I'm sure.

07:49.036 --> 07:52.172
(distant shouting)

07:52.205 --> 07:55.142
(Doug Burr's
"White Night, Black Light")

07:55.175 --> 07:57.277
BURR:
* Calling all believers

07:57.310 --> 08:01.214
* White night, black light
calling all believers *

08:01.248 --> 08:03.316
* Wake us up out
of a dead sleep *

08:03.350 --> 08:05.786
Hey, blondie.
Couple of boilermakers.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.656
(whistles)

08:08.689 --> 08:10.524
MAN: How'd she not see us, man?
Bitch must be blind.

08:10.558 --> 08:11.992
I don't know.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.795
Whoa, where do you think
you're going, princess?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.229
Just ordering a drink.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.998
Excuse me.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.000
Mineral water,
when you get the chance.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.669
Sure thing, doll.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.304
It's not that
she didn't see you.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.074
It's that she didn't like
what she saw.

*

08:42.690 --> 08:46.359
-(phones ringing)
-(coughs)

08:46.393 --> 08:50.664
(ringing continues)

08:50.698 --> 08:52.600
Seriously?

08:52.633 --> 08:54.902
Austin is a small town, TK.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.570
Or should I say Tyler Kennedy?

08:56.604 --> 08:58.505
Ugh.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.873
Bummer about getting arrested.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.541
People might find out
your real name,

09:01.575 --> 09:04.344
which marks the first actual
thing I've learned about you.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.779
Isn't your processing me, like,

09:05.813 --> 09:08.281
a conflict of interest
or something?

09:08.315 --> 09:10.550
The good news is,
neither of your new friends

09:10.584 --> 09:12.753
want to talk about
that little scuffle tonight,

09:12.786 --> 09:15.088
and since you blew a 0.0,

09:15.122 --> 09:17.257
we're not even giving you
drunk and disorderly.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.558
(handcuffs clicking)

09:18.592 --> 09:20.928
You're free to go.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.630
And what's the bad news?

09:22.663 --> 09:24.965
The bad news is that means
you did this with a clear head.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.534
(phones ringing)

09:27.567 --> 09:30.270
I'm not trying
to be your boyfriend,

09:30.303 --> 09:32.806
or even your friend,
if you're not into it,

09:32.840 --> 09:35.108
but you should talk to someone
about why you felt compelled

09:35.142 --> 09:37.477
to do something so suicidal.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.480
(dramatic music)

09:40.513 --> 09:44.217
*

09:44.251 --> 09:45.786
Got a little crud there,
by the way.

09:45.819 --> 09:50.123
*

09:50.157 --> 09:51.591
Other side.

09:51.625 --> 09:55.328
*

09:55.362 --> 09:59.132
Stop.
Just let me.

09:59.166 --> 10:05.773
*

10:07.174 --> 10:08.676
Thanks.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.478
(phones ringing)

10:11.511 --> 10:15.348
*

10:15.382 --> 10:17.685
I'm sorry I went crazy on you
the other night.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.988
I'm a cop.
I'm used to crazy.

10:21.021 --> 10:24.524
Look, I just went through
a really bad breakup.

10:24.557 --> 10:28.328
Like, nuclear bad,

10:28.361 --> 10:30.463
and then I relapsed.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.599
You mean with me?

10:32.632 --> 10:35.502
No.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.971
I mean with substances.

10:38.005 --> 10:41.942
*

10:41.975 --> 10:44.011
Right.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.613
Which explains your reaction
to the champagne.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.682
I'm such an idiot.
I'm--I'm sorry--

10:48.716 --> 10:50.517
No, it's fine, okay?

10:50.550 --> 10:52.052
I mean, ever since
I've gotten here,

10:52.085 --> 10:56.323
it's just--it's just gray,

10:56.356 --> 10:58.726
and I just feel numb
all the time.

10:58.759 --> 11:03.797
*

11:03.831 --> 11:06.333
I guess I just--
I wanted to feel something.

11:06.366 --> 11:12.239
*

11:13.841 --> 11:16.476
Judging by that lip,
I'd say mission accomplished.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.712

11:18.746 --> 11:19.913

my balls right now?

11:19.947 --> 11:22.082
Yeah, I suppose I am.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.729
All right, everybody!

11:35.763 --> 11:38.698
It's that time!
Oh, hey, cutie!

11:38.732 --> 11:41.334
-Whoo-hoo-hoo!
-She took my hat.

11:41.368 --> 11:45.272
Yeah!
All right, all right.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.908
It is that time, y'all,
to find out who's got

11:47.941 --> 11:54.347
the sheer audacity to take on
Teri's 96-ounce challenge,

11:54.381 --> 11:57.017
which is about 78 ounces
more sirloin

11:57.050 --> 11:59.052
than any mortal should eat
in one sitting,

11:59.086 --> 12:02.722
but these two are chasing
immortality, folks!

12:02.756 --> 12:06.459
That's right, in addition
to free steak for life,

12:06.493 --> 12:09.229
whoever finishes
one of these monsters

12:09.262 --> 12:13.967
gets their face on my
High Steaks Wall of Fame!

12:15.268 --> 12:17.037

-She's better than you!

sweetheart.

I'm Teri.
She's right through here.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.336
Did anyone see what she
was doing before she collapsed?

13:56.369 --> 13:57.804
Eating a 96-ounce steak.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.306
That's, what,
six pounds of meat?

13:59.339 --> 14:00.740
Why the hell would anybody
eat that?

14:00.773 --> 14:01.641
To get on my wall,
of course.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.476
Pride's a powerful thing.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.712
Sonya, we're here to help you.
I'm a paramedic.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.147
I have to go!

stay here for a minute.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.250
We're gonna get you out of here
as soon as possible.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.851
Sonya, is there any chance
that you're pregnant?

14:11.885 --> 14:12.886
No!

14:12.920 --> 14:14.587
BP is 90 over 60.

14:14.621 --> 14:15.755
But her heart rate's 116.

14:15.788 --> 14:16.689
I don't think
it's a heart attack.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.025
It hurts!

14:18.058 --> 14:19.326
Sonya, can you tell me
what year it is?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.228
-Tuesday?
-Concussion?

14:21.261 --> 14:23.030
It just doesn't make any sense.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.531
The wound on her head's
superficial.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.333
-Sonya, does this hurt?
-(groans)

14:26.366 --> 14:27.700
Her bladder's distended.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.037
Perforated stomach?
It's a eating contest.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.838

SONYA: Ow!

14:31.871 --> 14:33.506
That her place there
with the empty pitchers?

14:33.540 --> 14:34.908
Oh, yeah.
She was throwing them back.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.609
- This is hyponatremia.

14:36.643 --> 14:37.911
Water intoxication.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.446
We need to reposition her.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.014
Sonya, we're just gonna
swing you around.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.882
(groaning)

14:42.916 --> 14:44.617
Grab me a catheter
and a foley bag.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.253
We need to divert fluids now.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.121
Gillian, let's get
her underwear off.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.289
Captain, shouldn't we get her
on the rig

14:49.322 --> 14:50.523
and let the hospital
handle this?

14:50.557 --> 14:52.092
We give her a catheter now,
we'd be liable.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.094
Her bladder's about to burst.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.529
It's my call.
I'm the one who's liable.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.298
I need you
to take some deep breaths

14:58.331 --> 14:59.899
for me, okay?

14:59.933 --> 15:02.602
You're gonna feel
some pressure.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.538
-(Sonya shouting)
-(audience groaning)

15:05.572 --> 15:07.407
-Continue to breathe.
-(Sonya groaning)

15:07.440 --> 15:09.376
The bag's filling so quickly.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.778
I'm afraid her bladder's
gonna spasm.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.446
I'm trying to hold it off.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.781
MICHELLE: If I can just move
the tube a little this way--

15:14.814 --> 15:15.949
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

15:15.983 --> 15:16.883
-MICHELLE: Oh, no!
-No, no, no, no, no!

15:16.916 --> 15:19.252
TERI: No, no, oh!
(screams)

15:19.286 --> 15:20.753
TERI: No!

-(audience groaning)
-My wall.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.791
*

15:24.824 --> 15:26.493
What a mess.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.095
Pride makes people stupid.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.696
It sure does.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.504
(distant sirens wailing)

15:37.537 --> 15:40.573
I mean, what am--am I supposed
to do with this?

15:40.607 --> 15:42.976
There's thousands
of trucks here.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.611
It's ridiculous.

15:44.644 --> 15:47.514
You said your witness saw Iris
get into a blue pickup truck

15:47.547 --> 15:48.948
the night she disappeared.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.650
That's a list
of every blue truck

15:50.683 --> 15:51.951
that was registered

15:51.985 --> 15:53.486
in the greater Austin metroplex
at that time.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.588
I mean, are you saying
I should just give up?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.024
No.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.958
I'm saying you should start
with the guy in Texas

15:58.992 --> 16:01.528
you know who doesn't drive
a blue pickup truck

16:01.561 --> 16:03.463
but who might know who did.

16:03.496 --> 16:07.334
Iris's boyfriend,
Dustin Shepard.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.336
I'm sorry, officer.

16:09.369 --> 16:12.372
Are you suggesting that
I violate a restraining order?

16:12.405 --> 16:13.773
Like you need
any encouragement.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.475
I'm just saying next time

16:15.508 --> 16:17.110
you do violate
the restraining order--

16:17.144 --> 16:18.678
which you will--

16:18.711 --> 16:20.680
maybe be a little more polite
and you might get

16:20.713 --> 16:22.849
a few questions answered
before you get arrested.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.551
Not to that scumbag.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.553
Well, if that scumbag
is innocent,

16:26.586 --> 16:28.055
he might have information
that can help.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.789
If--if he's innocent,

16:29.822 --> 16:31.658
and I've been harassing him
for all these years,

16:31.691 --> 16:35.362
I am the last person
that he's gonna speak to.

16:35.395 --> 16:38.398
God, what if I'm wrong?

16:40.433 --> 16:41.901
You know what?
No.

16:41.934 --> 16:43.236
He was a dick to her

16:43.270 --> 16:44.671
the whole time
they were together,

16:44.704 --> 16:47.006
and just because he doesn't own
a blue truck

16:47.040 --> 16:49.376
doesn't mean
he wasn't involved.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.144
Well, either way,

16:51.178 --> 16:53.413
you want to find out
where Iris went,

16:53.446 --> 16:56.383
you may need
to swallow your pride.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.085
I'd rather swallow glass.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.586
Mm.

motion sickness *

What's the latest in your life?

17:15.968 --> 17:17.370
Seeing anybody?

17:17.404 --> 17:18.905
How interesting.

17:18.938 --> 17:21.674
Isn't friendship fun?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.910
I'm sorry.

This hasn't exactly been
a two-way street lately.

What is going on in your life?

17:34.387 --> 17:36.356
-Are you seeing anyone?
-No.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.057
I'm not.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.226
I don't think.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.027
You don't think?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.061
What does that mean?

17:42.095 --> 17:44.097
I met someone,
we hooked up,

17:44.131 --> 17:45.698
then it got weird.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.634
-Doesn't it always get weird?
-No, Michelle.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.869
It doesn't always get weird.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.605
So?
Tell me about this boy.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.442
You know him, actually.

-TK Strand.

-Nice.
-Yeah.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.913
He's a ten,

18:00.947 --> 18:03.983
and now I kind of can't get him
out of my head.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.385
So why don't you ask him out?

18:05.418 --> 18:09.222
Oh, no.
He'd probably ghost me.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.624
I just hate being the one
doing the chasing.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.059
Why?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.495
You're the one with
the handcuffs.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.930
What were you just saying
about swallowing pride?

18:17.964 --> 18:23.736
*

18:23.770 --> 18:25.972
MATEO: Hey, check it out.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.474
Yo, these comments.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.842
PAUL: "BRB,
gotta burn down my house."

18:29.876 --> 18:31.844
Redneckonize says,

18:31.878 --> 18:35.648
"Must almost die so she
can give me mouth to mouth."

18:35.682 --> 18:38.084
Can you turn that off, Probie?
Seriously.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.519
PAUL:
Oh, come on.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.087
Do not pretend like you
don't love the attention.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.523
I do, just not
when it's like that.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.659
My dentist is Muslim
and she doesn't wear a hijab.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.829
It's a choice.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.130
MATEO:
So you wear that by choice?

18:51.164 --> 18:52.365
Why?

18:52.399 --> 18:55.202
Connects me
to something bigger.

18:55.235 --> 18:58.104
Not just my faith but
to those who came before me.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.773
My mom, my aunties,
my grannies.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.175
They taught me to be proud
of who I am

19:02.209 --> 19:04.110
no matter what people say,

19:04.143 --> 19:06.313
and I carry that with me
every time I wear it.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.281
Oh, I get it.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.550
It's like Superman's cape.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.853
I mean, without it,
he's just a guy in tights.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.154
What the hell are you
talking about, Probie?

19:15.188 --> 19:16.856
He's all powerful
no matter what he wears.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.325
He is?
I missed that.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.727
I hate you both.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.531
(kids laughing)

19:27.534 --> 19:30.237
-Dustin.
-(scoffs)

19:30.270 --> 19:32.539
This is a new low,
even for you.

19:32.572 --> 19:35.141
This is my school, Michelle.
There are kids here.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.344
I don't wanna fight.
I just wanna talk.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.045
DUSTIN: Well, you can talk
to the cops.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.314
I-I get why you hate me.
I guess, you know,

19:41.348 --> 19:43.883
I-I-I have been
a little bit rude

19:43.916 --> 19:46.419
and possibly,
I've been wrong about you.

19:46.453 --> 19:48.388
Is this you apologizing,
Michelle?

19:48.421 --> 19:50.523
I think so.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.725
I'm really trying here,
Dustin.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.727
Why?
Why now?

19:54.761 --> 19:56.329
Because I need your help.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.231
Please, you gotta
be kidding me.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.999
The night Iris went missing,

20:00.032 --> 20:03.035
she was seen getting into
a blue truck.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.672
Who told you that?

20:05.705 --> 20:07.206
One of your neighbors.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.841
So you're harassing
my neighbors now?

20:08.875 --> 20:11.444
No, I'm not harassing
your neighbors.

20:11.478 --> 20:14.681
I'm just trying to figure out
what happened to my sister,

20:14.714 --> 20:18.050
and it's made me
a little crazy.

20:18.084 --> 20:21.588
I'm--yes, I have been awful
to you, Dustin.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.590
I have,
and--and I am not too proud

20:23.623 --> 20:26.359
to admit it.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.928
Well, that can't
have been easy for you.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.264
You have no idea.

20:31.298 --> 20:34.100
Yeah, I'll bet.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.868
You know,
for three years,

20:35.902 --> 20:37.470
you've been telling
anyone who'd listen

20:37.504 --> 20:39.105
that I murdered Iris.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.907
I've been fired
from two jobs because of you,

20:40.940 --> 20:42.141
lost relationships,

20:42.174 --> 20:44.444
but because you can't
let go of Iris,

20:44.477 --> 20:46.078
nobody else gets to, either.

20:46.112 --> 20:47.814
How can I let go?

20:47.847 --> 20:49.782
She was my sister.

20:49.816 --> 20:53.753
Well, you're referring
to her in the past tense.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.087
I guess that's a start.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.156
You are a bastard.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.392
Yeah, and you're in violation
of a restraining order.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.260
Don't ever try
and speak to me again.

21:01.294 --> 21:04.331
Yes, I'd like
to report a stalker.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.765
-(school bell ringing)
-Really?

21:11.871 --> 21:14.841

21:14.874 --> 21:18.678
WAYNE: Yeah, 17 down.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.480

(dramatic music)

21:23.483 --> 21:26.686

21:26.719 --> 21:28.287
WAYNE: So what you in for?

21:28.321 --> 21:30.423
*

21:30.457 --> 21:32.459
Cancer.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.193
(scoffs)

21:34.226 --> 21:39.799
Stage 2, 3, 4?
Prostate, pancreas, lymphoma?

21:39.832 --> 21:41.768
I'm sorry.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.003
I'm a stats guy.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.205
Lung cancer.
1B.

21:46.238 --> 21:49.208
Yeah, it's not great.

21:49.241 --> 21:52.845
Me, I got it in my bones.
Stage 4.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.682
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-Ah.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.784
Owen Strand.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.952
Wayne Gettinger.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.188
So what line of work you in,
Owen?

22:02.221 --> 22:04.391
-I'm a fire captain.
-Ah.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.459
Well, then you get it.

22:06.493 --> 22:09.295
You know, the worst part
about this deal

22:09.328 --> 22:10.997
is breaking the news
to your team.

22:11.030 --> 22:14.300
God, I--
I dreaded telling my boys.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.868
Old Baxter High,

22:15.902 --> 22:17.537
head football coach 30 years.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.843
How'd they take it,
your boys?

22:23.876 --> 22:26.746
-Bawled like babies.
-(exhales sharply)

22:26.779 --> 22:28.915
But then they went and kicked
the crap out of Tyler High,

22:28.948 --> 22:31.317
so that was pretty sweet.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.019
Hey, what about yours?

22:33.052 --> 22:35.187
-I haven't told them.
-Ah.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.089
I mean, I told one guy,

22:37.123 --> 22:42.395
but, um, I haven't made
a big formal announcement.

22:42.429 --> 22:45.532
You know the deal
with cancer cells, don't you?

22:45.565 --> 22:46.833
They multiply.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.836
They gang up on you,
so, see,

22:49.869 --> 22:52.038
what you gotta do
is you do the same thing.

22:52.071 --> 22:56.242
You get as many folks
as you can around you.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.745
My people have enough
to worry about on their calls.

22:58.778 --> 23:02.415
-Mm.
-This is my fight.

23:02.449 --> 23:06.385
I kinda remember myself saying
that sort of thing,

23:06.419 --> 23:08.721
but that's not what this
is all really about,

23:08.755 --> 23:11.858
is it, son?

23:11.891 --> 23:14.594
It's pride.

23:14.627 --> 23:17.296
Alpha dogs like us,
we lose a step,

23:17.329 --> 23:19.732
we lose our minds trying
to prove that we haven't,

23:19.766 --> 23:21.701
and like it or not,
after this chemo,

23:21.734 --> 23:23.369
you're gonna get dog tired.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.137
You're gonna puke
like it's your job,

23:25.171 --> 23:28.908
and then--son, then you're
gonna get a little crazy.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.777
I've read the pamphlets.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.044
(sighs)

23:32.078 --> 23:34.647
You can't play hero ball
with cancer.

23:34.681 --> 23:37.817
You gotta stop struggling.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.086
'Cause when you struggle,

23:40.119 --> 23:42.655
that's when it pulls you under.

23:42.689 --> 23:45.658
(dramatic music)

23:45.692 --> 23:52.499

24:07.680 --> 24:10.316
Well, if it isn't #FireFox.

24:10.349 --> 24:12.418
Hey, Zara.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.453
I guess you guys heard
about hijab-gate.

24:14.487 --> 24:17.156
Six million views on Instagram.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.825
How could we not?

24:18.858 --> 24:20.527
There's nothing quite like
the worst moment

24:20.560 --> 24:22.529
of your life going viral.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.463
Well, to be fair,

24:24.497 --> 24:26.465
this isn't the first time
that you've gone viral,

24:26.499 --> 24:27.967
though, is it?

24:28.000 --> 24:31.671
*

24:31.704 --> 24:34.173
I'm gonna be honest with you,
Marjan.

24:34.206 --> 24:37.276
Some of the sisters here
are concerned.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.680
-About my hair?
-About your lack of modesty,

24:40.713 --> 24:43.282
which your job doesn't exactly
lend itself to.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.584
(exhales)

24:47.019 --> 24:49.021
Lady Fatima says,

24:49.055 --> 24:51.991
"A woman's best jewelry
is her shyness."

24:52.024 --> 24:53.893
And the Prophet--
peace be upon him--

24:53.926 --> 24:56.729
said, "Do not conceal
your testimony."

24:56.763 --> 24:58.998
This is who I am.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.467
And we totally get that,

25:01.500 --> 25:03.135
but you're still new to town.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.872
It's not like
you've put down roots.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.373
What are you saying?

25:07.406 --> 25:11.143
We think you should consider
finding another mosque.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.379
Oh.

Don't look now, Austin.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.920
It may be blue skies
at the moment,

25:20.953 --> 25:22.755
but brace for severe
weather conditions

25:22.789 --> 25:24.190
tonight and tomorrow.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.158
Storm warnings in effect
for Travis County

25:26.192 --> 25:28.160
and surrounding areas.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.896
You'll need more than
a 10-gallon hat.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.030
It's really gonna be
coming down later today.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.264
Hot damn.

25:32.298 --> 25:35.101

Andrea Graham, 26.

Witnesses say she went off
her seventh-floor balcony.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.859
CARLOS: Rattled but unhurt.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.293
Hey, Cap, should we just wait
for the M.E.?

26:01.327 --> 26:02.729
-(Andrea gasps)
-ALL: Whoa!

26:02.762 --> 26:03.863
Okay, that answers that.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.798
Full "C" spine precautions.

Let's get her off the roof.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.067
(gags)

26:08.100 --> 26:09.468
I got a pulse,
but it's weak.

26:09.501 --> 26:11.270
C collar.
Andrea?

26:11.303 --> 26:12.404
MARJAN: Andrea,
can you hear me?

26:12.438 --> 26:13.973
We're gonna move you
but first we need

26:14.006 --> 26:15.708
to stabilize your spine,
okay?

26:15.742 --> 26:17.043
All right,
you ready to lift her?

26:17.076 --> 26:19.211
OWEN: One, two, three.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.081
Both her legs are shattered.

26:22.114 --> 26:22.982
I got the leg splints.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.985

26:26.018 --> 26:30.322
My life is over.

What apartment she jump out of?

26:40.499 --> 26:41.934
Seventh floor,
right there.

CARLOS: You think
she was pushed?

26:50.176 --> 26:53.412
All right.
She wasn't asking for Michael.

26:53.445 --> 26:57.149
She was asking about her phone.

26:57.183 --> 26:59.018
Let's see what we got here.

26:59.051 --> 27:00.787
Namaste, my lovelies.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.355
Now I know some of you
are gonna call me crazy,

things to the next level.

an off day.

27:53.539 --> 28:00.279
*

28:08.420 --> 28:11.858
(Waylon Jennings's "Tonight
the Bottle Let Me Down")

28:11.891 --> 28:15.394
Hey, Chris,
can I get a double?

28:15.427 --> 28:18.330
JENNINGS: * Each night I leave
the barroom *

28:18.364 --> 28:20.032
* When it's over

28:20.066 --> 28:21.600
(indistinct chatter
and whistling)

28:21.633 --> 28:24.270
* Not feeling any pain

28:24.303 --> 28:26.672
Hey.
You took my seat.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.175
Did I?

28:29.208 --> 28:32.178
JENNINGS: * But tonight
your memory found me sober *

28:32.211 --> 28:33.846
Well, I guess there's
only one solution.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.682
Chris, can we get
the whole bottle?

28:36.715 --> 28:40.052
-You like tequila?
-Always.

28:40.086 --> 28:43.790
*

28:43.823 --> 28:46.458
JENNINGS:
* Tonight the bottle

28:46.492 --> 28:49.361
* Let me down

28:49.395 --> 28:51.130
What about the captain's kid,
Judd?

28:51.163 --> 28:52.965
What about him?

28:52.999 --> 28:54.100
He's been giving you
the stink eye

28:54.133 --> 28:55.567
since we walked in here.

28:55.601 --> 28:57.770
He's probably pissed off
because I told him

28:57.804 --> 29:00.206
that he's a pretty boy
who only has his job

29:00.239 --> 29:02.274
because of who his daddy is.

29:02.308 --> 29:03.776
Judson Ryder,
you didn't say that to him.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.211
He had it coming to him.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.478
And you were gonna be
the one to deliver it?

29:06.512 --> 29:08.047
Yeah, 'cause somebody
has to say it

29:08.080 --> 29:09.949
because he's an arrogant
little turd

29:09.982 --> 29:12.384
and he's gonna get himself
or somebody else killed.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.787
Okay, so then you got
your point across?

29:14.821 --> 29:16.555
I did not.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.589
Well, you need
to apologize--

29:17.623 --> 29:18.891
Me?

29:18.925 --> 29:21.493
He's the one
that's in the wrong.

29:21.527 --> 29:24.496
God opposes the proud,
shows favor to the humble.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.332
-GRACE: James 4:6.
-(Judd groans)

29:26.365 --> 29:28.234
Plus, he's your boss's kid.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.902
(sighs)

29:29.936 --> 29:34.306
JENNINGS: * Tonight
the bottle let me down *

29:34.340 --> 29:35.641
(groans)

29:35.674 --> 29:37.409
That'll clear out your sinuses.

29:37.443 --> 29:38.945
-You had enough yet?
-(Owen groans)

29:38.978 --> 29:41.313
Hardly.

29:41.347 --> 29:42.982
When you're face down
on the floor,

29:43.015 --> 29:44.483
don't call 911.

29:44.516 --> 29:48.955
Captain, I know my limits,
and I'm just getting started.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.990
I mean, where does he get off?

29:51.023 --> 29:54.326
You know, coming at me
with that redneck swagger?

29:54.360 --> 29:56.128
-(dart thuds)
-Calling me the coach's son.

29:56.162 --> 29:57.129
(dart thuds)

29:57.163 --> 29:58.464
I don't know.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.967
'Cause working in Manhattan
is such a cushy gig.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.168
Not sure.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.502
You know,
I once a window washer

30:03.535 --> 30:06.305
from the 44th floor
of the Chrysler Building.

30:06.338 --> 30:07.840
That's impressive.

30:07.874 --> 30:10.476
Yeah, I know it is.
Tell that to Cowboy Judd.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.845
You know, if I was
a less secure man,

30:12.879 --> 30:15.281
I might be bothered by the fact
that I worked up the nerves

30:15.314 --> 30:18.384
to ask you out
and you spent the entire night

30:18.417 --> 30:19.952
talking about another guy.

30:19.986 --> 30:23.522
Well, it pisses me off.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.992
Yeah, I noticed.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.793
Guess he hit a nerve.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.229
-What is that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.731
Just seems like nobody's ever
spoken to you that way before.

30:32.764 --> 30:35.134
You think he's right?

30:35.167 --> 30:36.903
(darts thudding)

30:36.936 --> 30:38.871
JENNINGS:
* I've always had a bottle

30:38.905 --> 30:40.372
Do you?

30:40.406 --> 30:43.209
(exhales sharply)

30:43.242 --> 30:44.376
You know I'm holding a dart.

30:44.410 --> 30:47.146
And I'm packing a piece.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.015
That's hot.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.516
*

30:50.549 --> 30:52.384
MICHELLE: I know why
you moved to Texas.

30:52.418 --> 30:55.321
It's the only state big enough
to contain your ego.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.023
Well, it wasn't for the sushi.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.025
*

30:59.058 --> 31:01.060
You think very highly
of yourself.

31:01.093 --> 31:03.229
*

31:03.262 --> 31:04.931
Maybe, but let's be honest.

31:04.964 --> 31:08.367
You're not exactly a paragon
of humility yourself, Captain.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.602
Are you calling me cocky,
Captain?

31:10.636 --> 31:12.104
I've seen you in the field.

31:12.138 --> 31:15.874
You're cocky,
but you wear it well.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.709
Thank you.

31:17.743 --> 31:19.178
*

31:19.211 --> 31:22.414
The, uh, probie
is feeling no pain.

31:22.448 --> 31:23.749
You, on the other hand,

31:23.782 --> 31:25.417
look like you're working up
an ulcer.

31:25.451 --> 31:28.020
What?
Oh, no, I'm--I'm fine.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.688
I don't know what
you're talking about.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.223
Right, right.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.291
Biting that lip,

31:32.324 --> 31:33.559
rubbing on the back
of your neck,

31:33.592 --> 31:36.895
classic self-soothing gestures.
Very un-Marjan.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.430
You're kinda creepy.
You know that?

31:38.464 --> 31:39.765
Hey, I just see what I see.

31:39.798 --> 31:41.867
(country music)

31:41.900 --> 31:43.802
I got slut shamed
at the mosque.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.537
Oh, the, uh,
hijab malfunction?

31:45.571 --> 31:47.773
It's not just that.
They--

31:47.806 --> 31:50.109
I've been told I need to find
a new place to worship

31:50.142 --> 31:52.278
because apparently
I am too proud.

31:52.311 --> 31:53.612
Yeah,
what do you think?

31:53.645 --> 31:57.116
Am I proud?
Yeah.

31:57.149 --> 32:00.286
And weirdly ashamed
at the same time.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.888
Yeah, I feel that.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.324
This mosque,
do you like it?

32:05.357 --> 32:07.259
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

32:07.293 --> 32:10.997
You do not let them shame you
for being proud.

32:11.030 --> 32:15.001
I say you strut in there
with your hijab held up high.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.469
(dramatic music)

32:17.503 --> 32:19.571
You know, I was telling you
about how I've been looking

32:19.605 --> 32:22.474
for my missing sister.

32:22.508 --> 32:26.645
I went to see her old
boyfriend, Dustin Shepard.

32:26.678 --> 32:29.115
I've always thought
that it was him.

32:29.148 --> 32:30.816
(country music)

32:30.849 --> 32:34.786
But now I think that maybe
I was wrong.

32:34.820 --> 32:37.656
So I had to just
put my ego aside

32:37.689 --> 32:40.159
and--and go over there
and ask for his help and--

32:40.192 --> 32:41.493
He told you to pound sand?

32:41.527 --> 32:44.030
I mean, basically, yeah.

32:44.063 --> 32:46.965
And the worst part about it
is that I don't know

32:46.999 --> 32:48.667
if it's 'cause
he's actually guilty

32:48.700 --> 32:51.637
or because I've been
treating him so horribly,

32:51.670 --> 32:53.539
like he is guilty,
for all these years,

32:53.572 --> 32:56.142
and it's driving me crazy.

32:56.175 --> 32:59.278
*

32:59.311 --> 33:01.880
Well, maybe he'll come around.

33:01.913 --> 33:03.549
I doubt it.

33:03.582 --> 33:06.018
Maybe he'll change.

33:06.052 --> 33:08.854
You never know.

33:08.887 --> 33:10.989
People could surprise you.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.558
OWEN: Thanks.

33:15.761 --> 33:17.563
(distant dog barks)

33:19.098 --> 33:21.100
(knocking)

33:23.269 --> 33:26.172
(distant TV playing)

33:27.606 --> 33:29.375
(knocking)

33:33.212 --> 33:35.147
(door opening)

33:35.181 --> 33:37.549
-Yes?
-OWEN: Dustin Shepard?

33:37.583 --> 33:39.551
Who are you?

33:39.585 --> 33:41.387
Owen Strand.

33:41.420 --> 33:44.256
I'm sorry to be knocking
on your door this hour.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.491
What do you want?

33:45.524 --> 33:48.560
I'm here for a friend,
actually.

33:48.594 --> 33:49.761
Michelle Blake.

33:49.795 --> 33:51.363
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.232
Listen, I know there's been
bad blood between you guys

33:53.265 --> 33:55.067
and, look, I gotta be honest.

33:55.101 --> 33:57.669
I'm kinda on your side.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.272
I mean, she's definitely
got that thing.

34:00.306 --> 34:01.740
My ex-wife had it.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.775
The first ex-wife.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.512
Actually, both of my ex-wives
had it to a degree,

34:06.545 --> 34:08.847
but for sure the first one.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.217
-Are you drunk?
-OWEN: My point is...

34:12.784 --> 34:14.920
She lost her sister.

34:14.953 --> 34:18.424
Hey, and all I'm asking
is that you talk to the lady

34:18.457 --> 34:20.025
and tell her what you know.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.627
Or--or what you don't know.

34:23.595 --> 34:25.030
But talk to her.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.932
And who the hell are you again?

34:26.965 --> 34:28.400
(groans)

34:28.434 --> 34:30.068
(vomits)

34:30.102 --> 34:31.570
God, disgusting.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.038
Get off my porch,
you sick old man.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.039
(grunts)

34:34.072 --> 34:36.275
You're right, I am sick.

34:36.308 --> 34:38.310
And lately I've been feeling
pretty old,

34:38.344 --> 34:40.779
neither of which is putting me
in a great mood.

34:40.812 --> 34:43.615
That woman's in pain,

34:43.649 --> 34:45.251
and you are causing her
more pain.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.753
(Dustin groaning)

34:47.786 --> 34:49.488
She devotes her whole life
to helping people,

34:49.521 --> 34:50.789
so now you're gonna help her.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.424
You got it?

34:52.458 --> 34:53.992
I got it.
I got it.

34:54.025 --> 34:56.395
(both breathing heavily)

34:56.428 --> 34:58.164
You have a good night.

34:58.197 --> 35:01.400
(tense music)

35:01.433 --> 35:02.434
Sorry about your shoes.

35:16.815 --> 35:18.484
JUDD: Uh, hey.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.519
Um...

35:23.222 --> 35:25.457
My last crew died
in front of me.

35:27.459 --> 35:32.431
Not--not my crew.
Um, they were my brothers.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.132
At night if I'm trying
to go to sleep,

35:34.166 --> 35:37.336
I see them.
If I hear a car backfire,

35:37.369 --> 35:38.770
I see them.

35:38.804 --> 35:42.274
Sometimes I see them
for no reason at all.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.210
When you and Marjan
went down under...

35:46.578 --> 35:48.214
Something happened to me.

35:48.247 --> 35:49.848
I-I don't--I don't know.
I got, uh--

35:49.881 --> 35:52.017
Triggered?

35:52.050 --> 35:53.785
I was gonna say stirred--
stirred me up,

35:53.819 --> 35:55.454
but it's the same thing.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.189
I didn't get after you...

35:58.924 --> 36:00.692
Because I was mad.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.027
I...

36:02.060 --> 36:04.996
(dramatic music)

36:05.030 --> 36:06.031
*

36:06.064 --> 36:07.733
I was scared.

36:07.766 --> 36:10.702
*

36:10.736 --> 36:13.004
But I do want you
to know that, um...

36:14.740 --> 36:16.675
You know, I'm--

36:16.708 --> 36:18.610
Thank you.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.180
For calling me out.

36:22.214 --> 36:25.251
*

36:25.284 --> 36:26.485
You were right, man.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.687
N-no one has ever talked
to me like that.

36:28.720 --> 36:32.524
*

36:32.558 --> 36:34.360
And I appreciate it.

36:34.393 --> 36:37.263
Hey, man,
that's what brothers do.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.931
All right, well,
if we're brothers,

36:39.965 --> 36:41.900
you can't call me
the coach's son anymore,

36:41.933 --> 36:43.101
because you are too.

36:43.134 --> 36:44.870
Well, okay.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.572
Deal.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.039
We're good?

36:48.073 --> 36:49.741
Yeah, we're good.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.543
MATEO: Aww.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.078
PAUL: Why don't y'all
hug it out?

36:53.111 --> 36:54.112
TK: Shut up!

36:54.145 --> 36:56.081
(all speaking at once)

36:56.114 --> 36:57.182
Hey, man, y'all should shut up.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.084
Yeah, my son.
Sweet baby boy.

36:59.117 --> 37:01.453
-(Mateo laughing)
-PAUL: Sweet baby boy.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.561
-Captain.
-Hey.

37:09.595 --> 37:10.596
You have a second?

37:10.629 --> 37:12.264
Yeah, sure.
What's up?

37:12.298 --> 37:14.800
Yeah, remember the fella
you told me about at the bar?

37:14.833 --> 37:16.768
Dustin Shepard?

37:16.802 --> 37:18.236
Kinda ran into him last night.

37:19.505 --> 37:21.239
What?
Where?

37:21.273 --> 37:23.208
At his house.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.311
I got the address
from dispatch.

37:25.344 --> 37:28.113
Owen, the man has
a restraining order against me.

37:28.146 --> 37:29.247
See, that would have
been good information

37:29.281 --> 37:30.215
to have shared last night.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.717
Oh, my God.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.152
I thought I could have
a civil conversation with him.

37:34.185 --> 37:35.721
Things got heated,
he said some things,

37:35.754 --> 37:39.090
I said some things,
and I kinda lost it.

37:39.124 --> 37:40.258
Lost it meaning--

37:40.292 --> 37:41.560
I maybe kicked his ass
a little bit.

37:41.593 --> 37:42.628
What?

37:42.661 --> 37:44.730
You assaulted him?

37:44.763 --> 37:46.164
I mean, you know,
h-he could press charges

37:46.197 --> 37:47.466
against both of us.

37:47.499 --> 37:48.567
But you didn't have anything
to do with it.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.402
Who's gonna believe that?

37:50.436 --> 37:51.637
You're right.
I'm sorry.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.071
I-I was just trying to help.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.073
I'm not some damsel
in need of saving.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.342
100% right.

37:56.375 --> 37:59.010
What I did was presumptuous,
inappropriate,

37:59.044 --> 38:01.079
and probably sexist.
I'm--

38:01.112 --> 38:02.481
(groans)

38:02.514 --> 38:03.815
I think I'm going through
some stuff right now.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.283
Get a therapist!

38:06.685 --> 38:09.621
(tense music)

38:09.655 --> 38:11.289
*

38:11.323 --> 38:12.991
What's up?

38:13.024 --> 38:19.831
*

38:23.001 --> 38:24.770
(door closes)

38:24.803 --> 38:26.638
I need you to know
that I had nothing

38:26.672 --> 38:28.440
to do with
Captain Strand coming

38:28.474 --> 38:29.475
to your house last night.

38:29.508 --> 38:30.709
(scoffs)

38:30.742 --> 38:32.678
Captain Strand.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.646
Did you ice that?

38:34.680 --> 38:36.147
I'm fine.

38:36.181 --> 38:41.119
*

38:41.152 --> 38:43.054
You might try this arnica.

38:43.088 --> 38:44.956
It'll help with the bruising
and the swelling.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.358
Thanks.

38:46.392 --> 38:49.027
*

38:49.060 --> 38:51.863
I'm surprised you didn't
turn up here with the police.

38:51.897 --> 38:54.132
Honestly, Michelle,
I'm not interested in having

38:54.165 --> 38:56.134
any more legal dealings
with you,

38:56.167 --> 38:58.236
or any dealings with you,
for that matter.

38:58.269 --> 39:01.873
*

39:01.907 --> 39:04.576
I never liked you.

39:04.610 --> 39:06.512
You're arrogant,
a know-it-all,

39:06.545 --> 39:08.179
a bully,

39:08.213 --> 39:10.649
and I felt that way
before Iris went missing.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.519
Then why are you here?

39:13.552 --> 39:15.987
You wanna talk about Iris?

39:16.021 --> 39:18.924
Fine.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.058
I just don't know
if you're ready

39:20.091 --> 39:21.393
to hear what I have to say.

39:21.427 --> 39:23.929
Try me.

39:23.962 --> 39:26.665
You think your sister
was so perfect?

39:26.698 --> 39:28.400
-She wasn't.
-I never said that.

39:28.434 --> 39:29.668
Oh, please.

39:29.701 --> 39:32.037
You and your mom idolized Iris,

39:32.070 --> 39:34.105
and the further away
she gets from you,

39:34.139 --> 39:37.108
the more sainted she becomes.

39:37.142 --> 39:42.113
The fact is,
you didn't know Iris.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.049
And I didn't, either.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.117
Not at the end.

39:46.151 --> 39:49.421
What's that supposed to mean?

39:49.455 --> 39:51.723
Something in her changed.

39:51.757 --> 39:55.794
I mean, she was always
so stable

39:55.827 --> 39:59.798
and sweet and kind,

39:59.831 --> 40:01.767
and then something happened.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.034
I don't know what,

40:03.068 --> 40:05.236
but it was like something
inside her broke.

40:05.270 --> 40:08.874
She wasn't...Iris,

40:08.907 --> 40:10.375
and she started hanging out

40:10.408 --> 40:12.644
with people she wouldn't
introduce me to.

40:12.678 --> 40:14.613
Did you tell all of this
to the police?

40:14.646 --> 40:16.381
Whoever those people were,

40:16.414 --> 40:17.883
they could have been
driving that truck.

40:17.916 --> 40:21.620
I told the police
everything I knew,

40:21.653 --> 40:25.824
which only made me realize
how little I did know.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.793
And why didn't you tell me?

40:27.826 --> 40:31.597
From the day Iris went missing,

40:31.630 --> 40:34.299
you accused me
of murdering her.

40:34.332 --> 40:39.337
*

40:39.370 --> 40:41.106
I was supposed to protect her.

40:41.139 --> 40:44.976
*

40:45.010 --> 40:48.279
And I lost her.

40:48.313 --> 40:51.850
She went off into the darkness,
and I let her go,

40:51.883 --> 40:53.485
and I didn't follow her.

40:53.519 --> 41:00.325
*

41:11.069 --> 41:12.971
She called me that night.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.607
More than once.

41:15.641 --> 41:17.643
And I didn't pick up.

41:17.676 --> 41:21.847
*

41:21.880 --> 41:26.117
And I have to live with that,
and it kills me.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.520
You're not the only one
who lost her.

41:31.189 --> 41:33.224
I know.

41:33.258 --> 41:40.198
*

41:50.942 --> 41:53.344
(thunder clapping)

41:53.378 --> 41:55.714
(wind howling)

41:55.747 --> 41:57.248
RADIO DJ: Well, those storms
we promised you

41:57.282 --> 42:00.351
are here earlier and fiercer
than first predicted.

42:00.385 --> 42:03.021
Tornado warnings in effect
countywide.

42:03.054 --> 42:05.190
Hang on to something, Austin.

42:05.223 --> 42:06.858
It's going to be
a bumpy night.

42:06.892 --> 42:08.927
(radio static)

42:08.960 --> 42:10.862
(sirens wailing)

42:10.896 --> 42:13.031
(thunder booms)

42:13.064 --> 42:14.933
Oh, my sweet Lord!

42:14.966 --> 42:16.835
(sirens blaring)

42:16.868 --> 42:18.103
