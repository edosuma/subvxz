00:03.002 --> 00:06.172
Whoa. Okay, Lawrence, hold my leg up.

00:06.965 --> 00:09.801
Okay, now rotate me slowly.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.178
What are you doin'?

00:12.512 --> 00:14.973
Um, what does it look like I'm doing?

00:15.056 --> 00:16.516
Swan Lake?

00:17.392 --> 00:20.311
I'm buying tickets
to the premiere of Wormhole of Justice.

00:20.645 --> 00:24.107
Lawrence, keep holding my foot.
Now touch the lockers.

00:24.524 --> 00:25.859
Yes, got a signal!

00:26.025 --> 00:28.445
I don't think I'm overstating it
when I say this movie is

00:28.528 --> 00:31.364
the most important thing that's
ever happened in the universe ever!

00:32.073 --> 00:33.783
Well I thought
that movie already came out.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.201
[gasping]

00:35.952 --> 00:37.746
You must be thinking of the book series.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.040
Or the video games,
or the action figures, or the-- aaaah!

00:40.123 --> 00:41.124
[thudding]

00:41.207 --> 00:43.334
I use the Wormhole exfoliating shower gel.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.754
It made dermatitis erupt
on my torso and feet.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.673
Dude, you should keep your rash stories
to yourself.

00:48.923 --> 00:51.259
Deep, deep down inside yourself.

00:52.135 --> 00:55.597
Too late. There's already pictures
of my middle back in a medical journal.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.310
Yo, Lawrence. A little help?

01:02.854 --> 01:06.441
Anyway, I'm getting us all tickets
so the whole band can sit together.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.778
Or, we could see a movie
with actual humans in it.

01:09.986 --> 01:12.363
-Ah!
-You take that back.

01:12.864 --> 01:14.991
She was kidding! Tell them you're kidding!

01:15.116 --> 01:19.037
Well I just meant that I doubt
everyone wants to see Wormhole of Justice.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.371
-I do.
-I do.

01:20.622 --> 01:23.124
Wormhole of Justice?
You gotta get me a ticket.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.127
I'm going to the midnight show
because I'm a grown-up.

01:26.211 --> 01:30.298
Ha! Pew, pew-pew-pew-pew!
Pew-pew-pew-pew!

01:30.924 --> 01:32.550
Are you guys talking Wormhole?

01:33.176 --> 01:36.471
Thank goodness, because I just ran
into someone who had no idea

01:36.554 --> 01:38.932
what I was talking about. Lame!

01:39.390 --> 01:41.226
Or maybe they have a real life.

01:41.309 --> 01:42.560
[chuckling]

01:44.437 --> 01:46.981
Which is so lame.

01:52.028 --> 01:53.947
Guys, guys. Check this out.

01:54.030 --> 01:55.949
Something amazing is on my phone.

01:56.616 --> 01:57.784
A cat in a kimono?

01:57.909 --> 02:00.078
Oops. That's not what I wanted
to show you.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.539
But he is Cat of the Week
if you follow my blog.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.961
O-M-G!

02:08.086 --> 02:11.131
Super producer Mick Bronson's having
a showcase right here in Austin

02:11.214 --> 02:12.298
to scout for new talent.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.883
Hey, we're new talent!

02:13.967 --> 02:15.844
That's why we gotta play that showcase.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.304
He could turn us into superstars.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.723
It says we just have
to submit a recording of our music.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.433
I could build us a recording studio.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.478
Thanks, Lawrence,
but we need a professional studio.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.563
No problem.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.983
I can get us into the best
recording studio in all of Austin.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.192
Let's do this!

02:32.735 --> 02:35.280
Mr. Finn, how long is it gonna take us
to get to the studio?

02:35.405 --> 02:39.075
Oh, we're already here.
This is the studio.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.785
This hoopty?

02:41.828 --> 02:43.079
Come on, guys!

02:43.163 --> 02:45.290
All my bands have recorded in this van.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.376
It may not look like much,
but it's got everything we need.

02:48.459 --> 02:52.630
And a lot of things we don't need,
like these taco wrappers?

02:52.755 --> 02:57.802
Okay, that's my sound-proofing.
Now we're good.

02:58.011 --> 03:02.640
Come on, give old Van Halen a try!
Plug in, let's lay down a track!

03:06.185 --> 03:07.228
Aren't you gonna pull over?

03:07.353 --> 03:10.064
I can't. The equipment won't work
if the van's not in motion.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.734
Recording. Let's rock.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.445

-[tires screeching]
-Whoa.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.789
Sorry, there was a detour.
I had to turn onto Hillview.

That's the curviest street in Austin!

There's a straightaway comin' up.

03:34.505 --> 03:35.840
-Start singing, start singing!
-Um--

03:35.924 --> 03:38.092
But hurry. In a quarter mile it turns
into gravel.

the track and see what we got.

on the Wormhole series?

10:54.862 --> 10:58.783
[rock music playing]

10:58.866 --> 10:59.867
I guess he can.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.750
Who are these guys?

11:07.917 --> 11:10.211
And why are they playing our parts?

11:10.586 --> 11:13.506
I'm glad you're here.
You guys are gonna love how you sound.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.759
How we sound? We're not even playing!

11:17.218 --> 11:19.261
Oh yeah, I hired session musicians.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.013
You've replaced us?

11:21.180 --> 11:23.849
Only musically.
You'll still return to your homes tonight.

11:25.601 --> 11:31.357
This dude is amazing--ly unnecessary
and it was not cool for you

11:31.440 --> 11:33.275
to hire people without asking us.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.860
Show me that lick again?

11:36.612 --> 11:38.030
How can you even afford them?

11:38.197 --> 11:39.448
They're surprisingly cheap.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.784
I just had to pay them in cafeteria pizza.

11:44.787 --> 11:48.791
I don't want to be a diva,
but that girl's gotta get her own bucket.

11:50.209 --> 11:53.337
Is this because I didn't wanna
play guitar playing upside down?

11:53.712 --> 11:55.506
Because I stand by that decision.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.384
Hey, you guys wanted something great
for Mick Bronson.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.679
And we're lucky to get these guys.
They've got a lot of experience

12:01.762 --> 12:03.556
and they're gonna give us a unique sound.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.015
Totally School of Rock.

12:05.266 --> 12:09.895
You can't have the School
of Rock sound without School of Rock!

12:10.104 --> 12:11.981
Sure you can. Give it time.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.941
You'll see it's the right choice.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.028
Unh-unh-unh!

12:18.320 --> 12:20.406
You get pizza when you're done.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.291
Listen, Zack, Freddy, Lawrence.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.252
I just want-- Lawrence?

12:35.129 --> 12:39.216
Why is there a slightly more
feminine version of me sitting in my spot?

12:39.550 --> 12:40.843
That's New Lawrence.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.138
You replaced us so we replaced you.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.222
What?

12:45.556 --> 12:46.891
She's nothing like me.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.684
She's just a pale imitation.

12:48.893 --> 12:54.064
Thanks. I try to stay out of the sun
and wear a hat for prolonged exposure.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.901
Oh yeah? What's your preferred SPF?

12:56.984 --> 12:59.612
-45--
-[both] --because above 45 the difference

12:59.695 --> 13:01.822
between ratings is fractional at best.

13:04.241 --> 13:05.242
Okay.

13:05.534 --> 13:09.205
I'll allow that there are some
surface similarities.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.790
And since New Lawrence has replaced you
in our friendship,

13:12.208 --> 13:14.960
we decided to give her your ticket
for Wormhole of Justice.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.464
What? But we were all going
to see it together!

13:19.298 --> 13:21.217
Give it time.
You'll see it's the right choice.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.844
Old Lawrence, am I right?

13:23.928 --> 13:25.095
[laughing]

13:30.643 --> 13:35.064
And that's how we find out Lord Anders is
in fact the half-brother

13:35.147 --> 13:37.942
of evil Quaronian spice baron Zoltro.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.861
[Chuckling] That's it!
That's my girl right there.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.780
Ah, I got it! I'm a Wormer!

13:43.197 --> 13:46.283
Not quite. There's an alternate universe.

13:51.455 --> 13:55.417
Nooooooo!

13:56.502 --> 14:00.631
The movie's tonight. It's too much.
I can't learn all of this in time!

14:00.756 --> 14:04.385
There's way too many names
and they all start with a Q, X, or Z.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.137
Isn't there anyone on this planet named
Dave?

14:08.973 --> 14:10.933
Hey, it's okay.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.644
Some of us just aren't Wormer material.

14:13.978 --> 14:17.565
But everyone I know is a Wormer,
especially my best friend.

14:17.773 --> 14:18.857
I don't wanna be left out.

14:19.608 --> 14:23.487
Well you know what?
I'm not gonna let you be. I have an idea.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.450
I'm gonna act it out for you.

14:30.911 --> 14:34.623
In the beginning, there was a baby cyborg.

14:36.292 --> 14:40.671
Wahh, wahh! I will destroy!

14:42.047 --> 14:43.632
Pew-pew, pew-pew!

14:44.717 --> 14:48.304
And the planet exploded! Pffffshhhtt!

14:49.555 --> 14:54.768
Nooooo! My planet!

14:55.769 --> 14:58.606
--as the army
of hyper-intelligent cockroach creatures

14:58.731 --> 15:00.399
marched right into an ambush.

15:00.482 --> 15:04.528
[in squeaky voice] Oh no, it's a traaaap!

15:04.820 --> 15:06.280
-Oh no, oh no!
-Wait.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.824
We're rooting for the cockroaches?

15:09.158 --> 15:12.077
Yes! They're hyper-intelligent.
Stay with me!

15:13.954 --> 15:16.373
[imitating battle sounds]

15:16.624 --> 15:19.001
Into the wormhole, space jerk!

15:19.209 --> 15:20.961
Oh no, not the wormhole!

15:21.253 --> 15:23.631
Aaaaaaaagh!

15:24.131 --> 15:25.716
And that's-- [panting]

15:25.799 --> 15:30.179
--how the baby cyborg saved the megaverse.

15:32.765 --> 15:36.352
That was amazing! I totally get it now.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.895
-Thanks Tomikes.
-[panting]

15:37.978 --> 15:42.316

-Lawrence, Lawrence, Lawrence!

15:53.577 --> 15:57.831
[deep, laboured breathing]

15:57.915 --> 15:58.999
Hey, Mr. Finn.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.335
How'd you know it was me?

16:02.753 --> 16:04.838
The real Lord Anders doesn't wear
flip-flops.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.384
Ah. Gotta let my piggies breathe, bro.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.136
How come you're not dressed up
for the movie?

16:11.345 --> 16:13.764
They gave my ticket away to some lady me.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.266
Oh yeah, New Lawrence. Great kid.

16:17.434 --> 16:18.477
Even you?

16:19.144 --> 16:21.522
But the original is way better.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.483
[sighing] Well they don't think so.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.528
-They all hate me.
-No they don't.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.154
They just got their feelings hurt.

16:29.363 --> 16:32.866
I only replaced them because I wanted
the band to sound as good as possible.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.703
That's why I tried all those
crazy techniques.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.997
Music doesn't have to be that complicated.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.959
Did you know The Beatles recorded
"Twist and Shout" in one take?

16:42.042 --> 16:43.043
Really?

16:45.462 --> 16:49.466
I guess I was so into using my machines,
I lost track of my friends.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.636
My human friends!

16:54.430 --> 16:57.558
The thing about human friends is,
they forgive.

16:58.058 --> 17:01.103
Robot friends do too,
if you program them correctly.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.731
I'm really trying to help you here,
Lawrence.

17:04.898 --> 17:05.941
I know.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.069
I'm going down to the movie
and telling the band I'm sorry.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.154
All right.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.407
Aw man, I don't have a ticket.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.334
Let me know how it is.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.753
Thanks, Mr. Finn.

to your people!"

17:41.101 --> 17:43.979
-[movie playing in background]
-So again, I apologize.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.357
I got carried away, and I'd appreciate it

17:47.441 --> 17:49.485
if you could find it in your hearts
to forgive me.

17:49.860 --> 17:50.861
So what do you say?

17:52.029 --> 17:54.948
I say whoever you are, move outta the way.
I'm trying to watch the movie.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.577
Hey, we're over here, Lawrence.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.831
Guys, let me just start by saying
I'm sorry.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.918
It's okay. We heard you apologize
to the last four rows.

18:06.293 --> 18:09.755
Second row was your most heartfelt.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.840
-So can I come back?
-Too late.

18:12.549 --> 18:15.636
I'm already here and there's only room
for one Lawrence.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.679
But I'm Lawrence
and these are my friends--

18:17.763 --> 18:19.056
There can only be one!

18:19.807 --> 18:22.935
If I have to, I'm willing
to fight for my people.

-Then a battle you shall have.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.690
I like your costume, by the way.
Is it officially licensed?

18:28.774 --> 18:30.901
Yeah, thanks. I like yours too.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.946
Thanks. And now we fight.

of seaweed all night.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.296
Yuck. I thought it was burnt popcorn!

18:52.923 --> 18:54.758
-Here, wash it down with this.
-Okay.

I really just wanna be Katie again.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.632
Welcome back, New New Lawrence.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.676
Do you really have to call me that?

19:37.759 --> 19:39.803
No we don't. New Katie.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.514
I'm good with New New Lawrence.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.395
What happened to all the microphones?

19:48.478 --> 19:50.731
I decided all we need is just the one.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.361
I'm getting rid of anything that comes
between us and the music.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.571
Fine, I'll go.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.949
-No, Mr. Finn--
-Fine, I'll stay.

20:02.492 --> 20:03.619
See? We're a band again.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.704
Do you still want me to wear the bucket?

20:06.538 --> 20:09.833
No, but if you want to wear it outside
of here, that's your choice.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.711
My choice is no.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.466

we can see each other when we play.
