00:13.972 --> 00:16.349
announcer: SIX ARTISTS
WERE LEFT IN THE COMPETITION.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.893
- YOU MUST TATTOO THE EYELIDS.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.353
- HOLY [bleep].

00:20.437 --> 00:23.064
- I AM NOT [bleep] COOL
WITH THIS AT ALL.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.649
announcer:
IN THE FLASH CHALLENGE,

00:24.733 --> 00:27.569
THE ARTIST'S ACCURACY
WAS PUSHED TO THE MAX.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.612
- I AM TOTALLY AGAINST
TATTOOING FACES.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.156
- I HAVE MY FACE TATTOOED.

00:31.239 --> 00:32.281
- I THINK IT'S STUPID.

00:32.365 --> 00:33.283
- WHO THE [bleep] ARE YOU
TO CALL IT STUPID?

00:33.366 --> 00:34.951
- BECAUSE I KNOW--
- YOU DON'T KNOW [bleep].

00:35.034 --> 00:37.746
announcer:
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

00:37.829 --> 00:42.167
THE ARTISTS TACKLED
SOME COMPLEX PORTRAITS.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.462
TATU BABY PULLED OUT
A BIG WIN.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.380
- WE'RE GLAD TO SEE YOU
FINALLY COME BACK.

00:47.464 --> 00:48.214
- CONGRATULATIONS.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.258
- I LIKE SEEING YOU DO
WHAT JOSH DOES

00:50.341 --> 00:51.634
ONLY BETTER THAN JOSH.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.512
- EVERYBODY'S THREATENED
THAT I AM GOING TO WIN THIS.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.806
announcer: AT THE ELIMINATION,
JASON,

00:56.890 --> 00:59.642
JIME, AND KYLE
WERE THE BOTTOM THREE.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.312
- JASON, THE EAR,
THE HAIR, THE GLASSES,

01:02.395 --> 01:03.980
IT'S THOSE DETAILS
THAT ARE WRONG.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.355
- THIS IS NOT
THE BEST OF ME.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.984
- JIME, THERE WAS A LOT OF
INACCURACIES IN YOUR PORTRAIT.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.611
- I WENT AGAINST
MY BETTER JUDGMENT.

01:09.694 --> 01:11.029
- YOU SHOULD'VE
STUCK WITH YOUR GUT.

01:11.112 --> 01:14.491
- KYLE, THE FACT IS, THIS THING
IS JUST HARSHLY UNAPPEALING.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.534
- THAT SUCKS.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.078
- JASON, YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT
IT TAKES TO BE AN INK MASTER.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.666

FIVE ARTISTS REMAIN,

01:23.750 --> 01:28.338

02:34.362 --> 02:36.406

SEEING JASON PACK UP, MAN.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.158
- I FEEL A PRETTY LARGE SENSE
OF HONOR TO BE ABLE

02:39.242 --> 02:40.660
TO BE HERE WITH ALL YOU GUYS.

02:40.743 --> 02:41.661
LIKE, I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SITTING HERE.

02:41.744 --> 02:45.540
- I CAN'T EITHER.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.667
- WELL, AND, THEN, I'VE
EARNED MY RIGHT TO BE HERE TOO,

02:47.750 --> 02:49.085
BECAUSE I'VE DONE
TECHNICALLY SOUND WORK,

02:49.168 --> 02:50.628
EVEN THOUGH I'VE DONE
DESIGN PROBLEMS--

02:50.712 --> 02:52.088
- IN THE LAST COUPLE ONES,
YEAH.

02:52.171 --> 02:53.923
- BUT THEY'VE NEVER SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT COLOR WORK

02:54.007 --> 02:55.425
OR SHADING,
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN--

02:55.508 --> 02:57.260
- THERE'S SO MANY OTHER THINGS
BESIDES JUST TECHNICAL ABILITY.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.261
- WHAT I'M SAYING IS-- -

02:58.344 --> 02:59.929
- SOME OF YOUR JUDGMENTS
HAVE BEEN OFF.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.472
- MY ABILITY TO RUN MY LINES,
MY ABILITY TO PUT SHADING IN--

03:01.556 --> 03:02.307

PART OF THE GAME.

EVEN THOUGH YOU GUYS MIGHT NOT
AGREE WITH THAT, YOU KNOW.

03:05.101 --> 03:07.312
- OVER SOME OTHER PEOPLE
THAT DON'T.

03:07.395 --> 03:10.690
- BUT, I MEAN, I WOULD SAY
I'VE TATTOOED BETTER THAN

03:10.773 --> 03:15.111
ANYBODY ELSE HERE,
YOU KNOW, CONSISTENTLY.

03:15.194 --> 03:16.779
{\an8}- YOU'RE KIDDING ME,
RIGHT?

03:16.863 --> 03:18.406
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO THAT.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.366
THAT'S, LIKE,
A STUPID STATEMENT.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.368
- AND YOU'RE NOT LISTENING
TO WHAT I'M SAYING.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.328
- YOU SAID YOU TATTOOED
THE BEST OUT OF ANYBODY HERE,

03:23.411 --> 03:25.121
AND I, LIKE,
TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH THAT.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.123
- OBVIOUSLY, IT IS
A POINTLESS CONVERSATION,

03:27.206 --> 03:28.166
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA KEEP
POINTING OUT MY NEGATIVES

03:28.249 --> 03:29.959
WHILE I'M TRYING TO TALK
ABOUT POSITIVES.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.502
- BUT YOU'RE SAYING YOU TATTOOED
THE BEST OUT OF ANYBODY HERE.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.129
YOU JUST SAID THAT.
- AND I'VE--I'VE SAID--

- THAT IS NUTS.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.331
- OH, DUDE.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.707
- AWESOME, DUDE.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.584
{\an8}- BEING IN THE NAVY
IS WHAT GOT ME INTO TATTOOING,

04:11.668 --> 04:14.128
{\an8}AND NOW I'M BACK ON A NAVY SHIP
COMPETING AS A TATTOO ARTIST.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.838
IT'S KIND OF CRAZY.
- WOW.

04:15.922 --> 04:19.509
- WE GET TO TIE JOSH TO A
TORPEDO AND THEN LAUNCH HIS ASS.

04:19.591 --> 04:20.259
- IT DOESN'T STOP, HUH?

04:23.638 --> 04:24.889

04:42.699 --> 04:46.494
{\an8}WITH SKILL, CREATE ART
WITHOUT BEING ABRASIVE ABOUT IT.

04:46.577 --> 04:48.246
- FOR TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE,

04:48.329 --> 04:49.872
WE'RE ON THE <i> INTREPID</i>

04:49.956 --> 04:52.417
OF OUR NATION'S HEROES.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.086
LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.008
EACH YEAR, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN

05:00.091 --> 05:02.593
SERVE IN THE ARMED FORCES.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.221
WE HAVE SOME VETERANS
WHO ARE HERE WITH US TODAY.

05:05.304 --> 05:07.598
WE WILL ALSO BE JOINED
BY SOME FAMILIES

05:07.682 --> 05:11.227
WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES.

{\an8}TO PROVIDE THE MOST CUTTING EDGE
SERVICES AND SUPPORT

05:17.817 --> 05:20.278
{\an8}FOR VETERANS
WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY

05:20.361 --> 05:21.779

THANK YOU ALL

AND THANK YOU
FOR YOUR SERVICE.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.375

THESE FAMILIES AND VETERANS

05:34.459 --> 05:38.004
ON THEIR ROAD TO HEALING
BY ENGRAVING AN ITEM

05:38.087 --> 05:41.758
THAT'S AN EMBLEM
OF MILITARY SERVICE: DOG TAGS.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.718
{\an8}- I'M NOT THE MOST
ACCURATE PERSON

05:43.801 --> 05:44.552
{\an8}IN THE WORLD
WITH ENGRAVERS.

05:44.635 --> 05:47.013
ENGRAVING SOMETHING
THAT SMALL,

05:47.096 --> 05:48.347
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY
A CHALLENGE.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.307
- YOU MUST CREATE
A PERSONALIZED DESIGN

05:49.390 --> 05:52.435
COMMEMORATING EITHER
THE FALLEN SOLDIER

05:52.518 --> 05:54.312
OR THE VETERAN'S SERVICE.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.813
YOU WILL HAVE ONE HOUR
TO ENGRAVE YOUR DESIGN

05:55.897 --> 05:57.899
ONTO YOUR DOG TAGS.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.318
AND YOU'VE BEEN RANDOMLY
ASSIGNED A CLIENT.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.779
{\an8}- IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS
THAT PEOPLE

06:02.862 --> 06:03.946
{\an8}ARE REALLY PROUD TO WEAR,

06:04.030 --> 06:05.364
{\an8}BUT THE REASON WHY YOU
HAVE TO WEAR THEM

06:05.448 --> 06:07.450
{\an8}DEFINITELY CARRIES
A DARK SIDE TO IT.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.911
IT'S GONNA BE A PRETTY
EMOTIONAL DAY, I THINK.

06:09.994 --> 06:14.040
- YOU MUST USE FINESSE IN
ENGRAVING SUCH A SMALL SURFACE.

06:14.123 --> 06:17.293
TODAY YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

06:17.376 --> 06:20.004
THESE HEROES HAVE GIVEN OUR
COUNTRY A LOT TO BE PROUD OF.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.173
MAKE SURE YOU GIVE THEM
A DESIGN

06:22.256 --> 06:23.716
THEY CAN BE PROUD OF FOREVER.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.218
GOOD LUCK.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.761
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?
- HI.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.638
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- I THINK THEY'RE HERE.

06:28.721 --> 06:29.889
- KYLE.
- KYLE.

06:29.972 --> 06:30.723
- IT'S GOOD TO MEET YOU, TRACY.
- GOOD TO MEET YOU TOO.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.475
- WHO IS IT
WE'RE MEMORIALIZING?

06:32.558 --> 06:32.975
- MY SON, BRIAN.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.811
- WHAT'S HIS NAME?

06:34.894 --> 06:35.895
- THIS IS NEMO.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.147
- HEY, NEMO.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.650
- AS AN ARTIST,
YOU WANT TO HAVE FINESSE.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.818
{\an8}I THINK THAT GOES A LONG WAY
WITH TATTOOING,

06:41.901 --> 06:44.987
{\an8}WHEN YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT
RAPPORT WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.824
WITH THESE DOG TAGS,
ALL WE REALLY WANT TO SEE

06:47.907 --> 06:49.242
IS HOW THEY DEAL
WITH THIS SITUATION.

06:49.325 --> 06:52.954
THIS IS A VERY
INTENSE CHALLENGE.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.205
- MY FALLEN HERO
IS MY HUSBAND.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.916
- I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
- THANK YOU.

06:56.999 --> 06:57.875
- I'M PRIOR MILITARY MYSELF,
SO I--

06:57.959 --> 06:58.709
- OH, WELL,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.837
- THANKS.

07:00.920 --> 07:01.504
- I'M ACTUALLY STILL
ACTIVE-DUTY AIR FORCE.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.256
- OH, REALLY?
AWESOME.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.049
- I HAVE 24 FALLEN FRIENDS.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.052
IF YOU COULD TAKE EACH ONE
OF THEIR OPERATOR INITIALS

07:08.136 --> 07:10.763
AROUND, LIKE,
THE SEVEN SAIL PARACHUTE--

07:10.847 --> 07:12.515
{\an8}- HE WANTS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT
OF LETTERING.

07:12.598 --> 07:15.268
THAT MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO FILL
THIS ENTIRE SPACE.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.436
I KNOW RIGHT
FROM THE GET-GO,

07:17.520 --> 07:19.522
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.483
- MY SON, JORDAN,
WAS A UNITED STATES MARINE,

07:22.567 --> 07:26.195
AND HE WAS KILLED
BY A SUICIDE BOMBER.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.948
THE TRUCK EXPLODED,
AND JORDAN AND HIS COMRADE

07:29.031 --> 07:32.910
WERE KILLED INSTANTLY.

07:32.994 --> 07:36.622
- AS A PARENT, I CAN'T EVEN
HANDLE MY KID GETTING A BOO-BOO.

07:36.706 --> 07:40.209
I CANNOT FATHOM WHAT YOU GUYS
HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH,

07:40.293 --> 07:42.795
YOU KNOW, YOUR LOVE AND LOSS

07:42.879 --> 07:46.841
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS,
SO...

07:49.969 --> 07:54.348
[engraving needle buzzing]

07:54.432 --> 07:57.727
- I THINK YOU'RE DOING A HELL
OF A JOB WITH CLEAN LINES.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.729
- TOWARD THE END OF HIGH SCHOOL,
HE JUST SAID, "MOM,

07:59.812 --> 08:01.731
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT
TO DO WITH MY LIFE,"

08:01.814 --> 08:04.901
AND ONE OF THE LAST LETTERS
THAT HE WROTE HOME TO ME,

08:04.984 --> 08:06.944
HE WROTE THAT, "I FINALLY
FOUND A PLACE FOR ME.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.571
"I LOVE IT HERE
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

08:08.654 --> 08:12.116
I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN
TO BE THE BEST SOLDIER."

08:12.200 --> 08:13.492
- I REALLY WANT TO WIN THIS,

08:13.576 --> 08:15.745
BUT I'M PUTTING THAT OUT
OF MY HEAD,

08:15.828 --> 08:17.663
BECAUSE THERE IS
A HIGHER STAKE NOW.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.041
{\an8}WE'RE TRYING TO REPRESENT
SOMEBODY WHO'S FALLEN,

08:20.124 --> 08:23.419
{\an8}AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN DO
HER SON, BRIAN'S LIFE, JUSTICE.

08:23.502 --> 08:28.507
- 30 MINUTES REMAINING,
EVERYBODY, 30 MINUTES.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.927
- DO YOU MIND ME ASKING,
LIKE, HOW DID YOU GET HURT?

08:31.010 --> 08:33.261
- I GOT HIT WITH
A CHILD SUICIDE BOMBER.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.096
- OH, MY GOD.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.722
- TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
AND STUFF.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.850
THE NATIONAL INTREPID CENTER
OF EXCELLENCE

08:37.933 --> 08:39.684
REALLY HELPED ME OUT
TREATMENT-WISE.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.313
THERE IS NO WAY I WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN THROUGH WHAT I DID

08:42.395 --> 08:44.357
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THEM.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.608
- MAY I PLEASE SEE YOUR COIN,

08:45.691 --> 08:46.984
SO I CAN SEE SOME DETAILS
INTO THAT.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.402
- SURE.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.321
{\an8}- IT WAS LIKE A LITTLE CROSS
ON THE BACK OF THIS COIN

08:50.404 --> 08:53.115
{\an8}THAT THEY GAVE OUT TO HONOR
HIS SON WHO GAVE HIS LIFE.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.368
- IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
THAN WORKING ON FLESH.

08:55.451 --> 08:56.786
- YEAH, A LOT DIFFERENT.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.829
- I WANT TO TAKE ELEMENTS
FROM THE COIN

08:58.913 --> 09:01.749
AND APPLY THEM TO HIS DOG TAG.

09:01.832 --> 09:06.337
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX,

09:06.420 --> 09:11.384
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

09:11.467 --> 09:12.385
THAT'S IT.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.178
MACHINES DOWN,
NO MORE ENGRAVING.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.514
- I THINK THEY'RE AWESOME.

09:16.597 --> 09:17.390
I HOPE THE JUDGES
LIKE THEM TOO.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.642
- IT REALLY TURNED OUT WELL,
JIME.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.686
- YOU KNOW, CHRISTOPHER,
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH

09:21.769 --> 09:22.937
FOR BEING A PART OF THIS THING.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.855
IT WAS SUCH AN HONOR
AND A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.023
- I WANT TO GIVE THIS TO YOU,

09:26.107 --> 09:27.775
AND I WANT YOU TO GIVE THIS
TO YOUR SON.

09:27.858 --> 09:28.276
- OH, NO WAY.

09:28.359 --> 09:31.529
- I DO.
- OH.

09:31.612 --> 09:34.407
IT WAS PRETTY MOVING.
IT WAS PRETTY POWERFUL.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.533
{\an8}I'M DEFINITELY GONNA GO HOME
AND PRESENT IT TO MY SON,

09:35.616 --> 09:38.661
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW,
PASS THE STORY ALONG TO HIM.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.248
THANKS.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.625
- HEY, GUYS.
- HEY, JOEY.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.334
- HI.
- HI.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.586
- WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE TODAY?

09:46.669 --> 09:49.171
- TODAY WE WERE HONORING
MY HUSBAND.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.842
WE DECIDED TO TAKE TWO OF
HIS STRONG PERSONALITY TRAITS

09:52.925 --> 09:54.093
AND SHOW THEM.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.803
- JOEY, BOTH THESE DESIGNS
LOOK REALLY COOL.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.138
I REALLY LIKE THE WAY YOU
USED YOUR ENGRAVER

09:57.221 --> 09:59.557
TO SHOW SOME SHADING.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.767
THE PART THAT'S SHADED AND
ENGRAVED VERSUS THE SHINY PART

10:01.851 --> 10:02.852
OF THE DOG TAG
REALLY STANDS OUT.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.521
ANYBODY THAT KNOWS THIS MAN
IS GONNA UNDERSTAND

10:05.604 --> 10:08.441
WHAT THIS MEANS,
AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.

10:08.524 --> 10:09.567
- HEY, KYLE.
- HEY, GUYS.

10:09.650 --> 10:10.735
- HOW ARE YOU?
- HOW YOU DOING?

10:10.818 --> 10:12.486
- HELLO, TRACY,
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE TODAY?

10:12.570 --> 10:13.529
- WE'RE HERE TO HONOR MY SON.

10:13.612 --> 10:17.533
MY SON WAS VERY ARTISTIC,
VERY MUSICAL.

10:17.616 --> 10:19.702
IT JUST--I MEAN,
THAT'S WHO HE WAS AS A PERSON.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.913
GREAT JOB REALLY CAPTURING
BOTH SIDES OF HIS SPIRIT,

10:22.997 --> 10:25.041
ONE BEING A FUN MUSICIAN
AND JOKER.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.376
YOU REALLY HIT IT ON BOTH SIDES
OF THE FENCE ARTISTICALLY

10:27.460 --> 10:28.961
AND WITH A LOT OF FINESSE.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.005
- JOSHUA, HOW ARE YOU?
- HOW'S IT GOING, DAVE?

10:31.088 --> 10:31.881
- EARL,
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE TODAY?

10:31.964 --> 10:34.133
- I WANTED TO TAKE
THIS OPPORTUNITY

10:34.216 --> 10:37.303
TO COMMEMORATE MY FRIENDS
WHO DID NOT MAKE IT HOME.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.305
- IT TOOK FINESSE TO FIT THAT
MANY INITIALS

10:39.388 --> 10:41.974
AND HAVE IT STILL ALL TO
STAND OUT AND ALL TO BE LEGIBLE.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.184
YOU HIT THIS
RIGHT ON THE HEAD,

10:43.267 --> 10:45.186
AND THIS WAS A LOT TO DO
THAT YOUR CLIENT WANTED

10:45.269 --> 10:46.187
IN A SMALL SPACE.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.898
YOU REALLY DID A GREAT JOB.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.107
- HI, BABY.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.609
SPENCER,
WHAT DID YOU WANT TATU BABY

10:51.692 --> 10:52.985
TO DO HERE ON YOUR DOG TAGS?

10:53.069 --> 10:55.529
- I WANTED SOMETHING THAT
REPRESENTED WHY I DO WHAT I DO,

10:55.613 --> 10:56.655
AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY
FOR ME.

10:56.739 --> 11:00.451
MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER
ARE HUGE PARTS IN THAT.

11:00.534 --> 11:01.827
- I REALLY LIKE THE SCRIPT.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.662
I THINK IT ADDS A LITTLE
ELEMENT OF BEAUTY

11:03.746 --> 11:05.206
TO SOMETHING
THAT'S NORMALLY A TAG

11:05.289 --> 11:06.540
WITH A NAME AND SOME NUMBERS.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.666
AS FAR AS THE EYE,

11:07.750 --> 11:10.753
IT REALLY CAPTURES THE ESSENCE
OF HIS STORY.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.963
GREAT JOB.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.256
- HEY, JIME.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.383
CHRIS, WHAT DID YOU ASK JIME
TO DO HERE?

11:15.466 --> 11:18.803
- I ASKED JIME TO TRY
AND EVOKE A COUPLE IMAGES

11:18.886 --> 11:20.888
MY SON, JORDAN, REPRESENTS.

11:20.971 --> 11:22.515
- I THINK THIS IS REALLY COOL.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.392
PUTTING THIS LITTLE EAGLE
ON THAT LITTLE DOG TAG

11:24.475 --> 11:25.267
IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN
DESCRIBE OF YOUR SON

11:25.351 --> 11:27.353
AND FOR HIM TO BRING THAT OUT,

11:27.436 --> 11:28.938
AND THEN ALSO PUT
THE NAVY SYMBOL ON THERE

11:29.021 --> 11:30.731
TO COMMEMORATE THE MEDAL
HE RECEIVED.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.441
I THINK IT'S REALLY AWESOME.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.609
- IT'S REALLY NICELY DONE.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.277
I KNOW YOU'LL NEVER FORGET
THIS MOMENT.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.737
- NEVER.

11:36.821 --> 11:40.032
- WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
COMING AND SHARING WITH US.

11:41.742 --> 11:45.371
- IT'S TOUGH TO PICK
A TOP AND A BOTTOM.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.914
- EVERYBODY REALLY
TOOK IT TO HEART,

11:46.997 --> 11:48.082
AND THEY ALL CAME OUT AMAZING.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.126
- HOW IMPORTANT IS FINESSE
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS?

11:50.209 --> 11:51.919
- THE USE OF FINESSE TO BE
ABLE TO EXTRACT THE STORIES

11:52.002 --> 11:54.964
FROM YOUR CLIENT REALLY
GIVES YOU THE OPPORTUNITY

11:55.047 --> 11:56.298
TO PUT OUT YOUR BEST WORK.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.343
- I THINK KYLE'S IS ONE OF
THE MORE ARTISTIC ONES.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.345
THE LITTLE DETAIL
HE PUT IN THE BOOTS,

12:01.429 --> 12:02.221
THE GUN AND THE HELMET--

12:02.304 --> 12:03.931
- WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF JOEY'S WORK?

12:04.014 --> 12:04.849
- I THOUGHT JOEY'S
WERE SUPER COOL,

12:04.932 --> 12:07.143
THE WAY HE WORKED
WITH THE ENGRAVING.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.436
HE MADE IT LOOK STRONG AND BOLD.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.855
THE CROSS HAD COOL SHADING IN
THE RAYS.

12:10.938 --> 12:12.982
- TATU BABY DID THE HOMAGE

12:13.065 --> 12:14.733
TO THE GENTLEMAN'S DAUGHTER
AND HIS WIFE.

12:14.817 --> 12:15.860
- RIGHT.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.778
- I THOUGHT SHE DID
THE LETTERING REALLY NICELY.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.989
- JIME HAD THE GENTLEMAN
WHO LOST HIS SON.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.783
- THAT EAGLE WITH THAT 33
IS SUCH A STRONG, BOLD IMAGE,

12:22.867 --> 12:23.909
AND IT'S VERY WELL DONE.

12:23.993 --> 12:24.952
- JIME'S WORK ON THIS,
ARTISTICALLY,

12:25.035 --> 12:28.831
WAS SO PRECISE AND DELIBERATE
AND VERY TIGHT,

12:28.914 --> 12:31.125
AND HE USED A LOT OF FINESSE
TO DO THOSE TINY LITTLE DETAILS

12:31.208 --> 12:32.501
THAT REALLY LOOK GREAT.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.837
- JOSHUA WENT A LITTLE BIT
SIMPLER IN TERMS

12:34.920 --> 12:36.297
OF DESIGN ELEMENTS.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.841
THAT FIRST LOOK, IT'S NOT
AS ARTISTIC AS SOME OF

12:38.924 --> 12:40.843
THE OTHER ONES WE'VE SEEN,
BUT THE CRAFTSMANSHIP

12:40.926 --> 12:43.345
AND THE STEADY HAND
AND THAT CONSISTENT OUTLINE

12:43.429 --> 12:45.848
WAS REALLY NECESSARY TO BE ABLE
TO DO THAT VERY SMALL,

12:45.931 --> 12:47.057
TIGHT LETTERING.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.434
- WE'RE JUDGING ON FINESSE.

12:48.517 --> 12:49.727
A LOT OF THE OTHER PEOPLE
THAT DID MORE ARTISTIC STUFF,

12:49.810 --> 12:52.605
ENGRAVED OVER AND OVER TO SHADE
OR THICKEN UP.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.523
JOSHUA, HE PRETTY MUCH HAD
ONE CHANCE

12:54.607 --> 12:56.025
ON EACH ONE OF THOSE LINES.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.234
- WELL,
THIS IS A TOUGH ONE,

12:57.318 --> 12:59.111
BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO
SELECT A WINNER.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.237
WE ALL AGREE?
- YEAH.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.323
- LET'S DO IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

13:02.406 --> 13:05.534
TODAY, WE WERE TESTING
YOUR ABILITY TO USE FINESSE

13:05.618 --> 13:08.412
IN WORKING WITH YOUR CLIENTS
TO EXECUTE MEANINGFUL DESIGNS

13:08.496 --> 13:09.705
ON DOG TAGS.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.415
- IT FELT LIKE EACH ONE
OF YOU ALL HAD

13:11.499 --> 13:13.042
A REALLY STRONG CONNECTION
WITH YOUR CLIENT

13:13.125 --> 13:16.003
AND PUT SOMETHING INTO THESE DOG
TAGS THAT WAS WHAT THEY WANTED,

13:16.086 --> 13:18.547
AND WHAT YOU WERE ABLE TO DO
FOR THEM WAS REALLY AWESOME.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.508
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED
THAT THE WINNER

13:20.591 --> 13:24.053
OF TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE...

13:24.136 --> 13:26.764
IS JIME.

13:26.847 --> 13:29.099
- JIME,
ARTISTICALLY SPEAKING, MAN,

13:29.183 --> 13:29.725
IT WAS A LOT OF WORK
THAT YOU PUT IN

13:29.808 --> 13:31.727
IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.020
GREAT JOB.

13:33.103 --> 13:35.773
- JIME, YOU WILL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES

13:35.856 --> 13:37.316
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.235
{\an8}- JIME'S GONNA BE HANDING OUT
ALL THE SKULLS.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.778
{\an8}HE MAKES IT VERY OBVIOUS
THAT HE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.489
I KNOW HE'S GONNA GIVE ME
THE HARDEST CANVAS.

13:43.572 --> 13:44.740
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT

13:44.823 --> 13:46.909
AND GET READY TO MEET
YOUR HUMAN CANVASES

13:46.992 --> 13:48.327
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.912
- I CAME HERE FOR A REASON.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.415
{\an8}MY GOAL IS TO DRIVE TO THE END
OF THIS FINISH LINE.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.584
IF I'M NOT WAKING UP SEEING
MY KIDS FACES EVERY DAY,

13:55.668 --> 14:00.589
I'M MAKING IT COUNT.

14:00.673 --> 14:04.385
{\an8}- THIS WEEK YOUR TATTOO
MUST BE ON YOUR CANVAS' HEAD.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.053
{\an8}- HOLY [bleep].
WE'RE DOING HEAD TATTOOS.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.180
- YOU CANNOT [bleep] THIS UP.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.431
- THE FIGHT IS REALLY ON.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.642
I'M IN TROUBLE.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.775
- CONGRATS, AGAIN,
FOR WINNING ANOTHER ONE.

14:19.858 --> 14:20.901
- WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA BE
IN THE TOP THREE.

14:20.985 --> 14:24.613
IT'S OURS FOR THE TAKING,
BUT THAT THIRD SPOT,

14:24.697 --> 14:27.324
YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT,
THAT'S AN OPEN SPOT FOR ANYBODY.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.284
- IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY, LIKE,

14:28.367 --> 14:30.035
WHO I'D EVEN WANT
TO COMPETE AGAINST.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.287
- I'M FINE WITH KYLE
OR TATU BABY.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.371
- YEAH.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.498
- IT'S GONNA BE A RACE
TO THE FINISH LINE FOR ME

14:34.582 --> 14:36.709
AND JIME, BUT THE OTHER THREE
NEED TO BE WORRIED,

14:36.792 --> 14:38.168
ESPECIALLY JOSH.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.462
JOSH HAS BEEN THE BOTTOM
FOUR TIMES FOR A REASON.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.964
- THE FIGHT IS REALLY ON.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.340
FIVE PEOPLE LEFT.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.466
- YEAH, I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I REALLY BELONG

14:44.550 --> 14:46.677
IN THE FINAL FOUR,

14:46.760 --> 14:48.637
BUT WHEN THE OTHER CHOICE
IS SOMEONE LIKE JOSHUA,

14:48.721 --> 14:50.514
WHO SHOWS THE LEAST ABILITY,

14:50.598 --> 14:52.975
THEN I'M, LIKE, "WELL, YEAH,
I DO BELONG THERE."

14:53.058 --> 14:55.686
{\an8}- IF I WENT HOME BEFORE JOSHUA,
I'D BE DEPRESSED.

14:55.769 --> 14:56.770
HE'S THE LOWEST HANGING FRUIT
NEXT TO ME,

14:56.854 --> 14:58.981
BUT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY
THAT JOSHUA,

14:59.064 --> 15:02.318
EVEN WITH HIS LACK OF ABILITY
WITH A PENCIL,

15:02.401 --> 15:02.901
COULD END UP
WINNING THIS THING.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.245
{\an8}[needle buzzing]

15:19.418 --> 15:20.961
- WELCOME TO
THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

15:21.045 --> 15:24.048
KILL IT, AND YOU'LL BE ONE OF
THE LAST FOUR ARTISTS

15:24.131 --> 15:26.550
VYING FOR THE TITLE
OF INK MASTER.

15:26.634 --> 15:27.551
AS ALWAYS, YOU'LL BE JUDGED
BY OLIVER PECK,

15:27.635 --> 15:29.970
CHRIS NUNEZ,
AND MYSELF.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.181
WE ALSO HAVE
A SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.350
WITH OVER 12 YEARS
OF EXPERIENCE,

15:34.433 --> 15:36.477
HE TATTOOS
IN CHRIS NUNEZ' SHOP,

15:36.560 --> 15:39.688
HANDCRAFTED IN MIAMI, FLORIDA--
TWIG SPARKS.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.691
[applause]

15:42.775 --> 15:44.193
{\an8}- MY SPECIALTY IN TATTOOING
IS TATTOOS

15:44.276 --> 15:45.069
{\an8}THAT ARE MORE DETAILED.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.780
I GOT INTO TATTOOING
BECAUSE I HAD

15:47.863 --> 15:48.614
A VERY RICH ART BACKGROUND.

15:48.697 --> 15:49.990
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- SIR.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.450
- AS A JUDGE,
THE ONE THING I WANT TO SEE

15:51.533 --> 15:53.744
IS POSITIONING AND DESIGN.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.954
IF YOU UNDERSTAND DESIGN
AND YOU UNDERSTAND PLACEMENT,

15:56.038 --> 15:57.665
IT'LL MAKE THAT TATTOO
MORE SUCCESSFUL.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.208
{\an8}- KNOWING TWIG AWHILE,
HE'S VERY METICULOUS.

15:59.291 --> 16:03.879
{\an8}HE'S ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT
HE'LL CALL BULL[bleep] QUICK.

16:03.962 --> 16:06.048
- AS YOU KNOW,
WE'RE NOT YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.801
EACH WEEK, SPIKE AND
TACO BELL ARE GIVING VIEWERS

16:08.884 --> 16:12.054
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO
INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

16:12.137 --> 16:14.556
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.642
AMERICA'S VOTE WILL HAVE
A MASSIVE IMPACT

16:16.725 --> 16:18.727
ON THE LIVE FINALE.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.980
THIS WEEK, WE'RE TESTING
YOUR ABILITY TO USE FINESSE.

16:22.064 --> 16:25.693
{\an8}- FINESSE IN TATTOOING
IS YOUR HAND MOVEMENTS,

16:25.776 --> 16:27.945
{\an8}YOUR NEEDLE DEPTH,
YOUR PATIENCE WITH SOMEBODY,

16:28.028 --> 16:29.738
{\an8}BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE
IN TOO MUCH PAIN.

16:29.822 --> 16:30.989
- AS A TATTOO ARTIST,
YOU MUST BE ABLE TO HANDLE

16:31.073 --> 16:35.035
EVERYTHING FROM COMPLEX
TATTOOS TO DIFFICULT CANVASES.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.287
THE MORE COMPLEX THE TATTOO
OR THE PLACEMENT,

16:37.371 --> 16:39.748
THE MORE FINESSE IS REQUIRED
TO CREATE A MASTERPIECE.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.000
THERE IS NO BETTER TEST
OF FINESSE

16:42.084 --> 16:44.962
THAN TATTOOING ONE OF
THE MOST DIFFICULT PARTS

16:45.045 --> 16:47.047
OF THE BODY--
THE HEAD.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.260
{\an8}- HOLY [bleep].

16:51.343 --> 16:52.136
{\an8}WE'RE DOING HEAD TATTOOS.
THIS SUCKS.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.555
{\an8}- YOUR TATTOO CAN BE
IN ANY STYLE,

16:54.638 --> 16:56.890
{\an8}BUT IT MUST BE ON
YOUR CANVAS' HEAD.

16:56.974 --> 16:57.850
{\an8}- IT'S ON THEIR HEAD.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.059
{\an8}YOU CANNOT [bleep] THIS UP.

16:59.143 --> 17:02.604
{\an8}- TATTOOING HEADS
PRESENTS MANY CHALLENGES

17:02.688 --> 17:04.606
{\an8}THAT OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY
DO NOT.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.482
{\an8}THE HARD,
IRREGULAR BONE UNDER THE SKIN

17:05.566 --> 17:07.025
{\an8}REQUIRES A STEADY HAND.

17:07.108 --> 17:10.820
{\an8}THE SKIN IS THINNER,
FINER, AND MORE SENSITIVE.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.699
{\an8}- NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND
GETS THEIR HEAD TATTOOED.

17:13.781 --> 17:14.825
{\an8}THAT [bleep] HURTS.

17:14.907 --> 17:16.285
{\an8}- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.752
{\an8}- JIME,
YOU WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE,

17:25.836 --> 17:28.213
{\an8}AND YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES.

17:28.297 --> 17:31.592
{\an8}THERE'S A LOT ON THE LINE,
SO CHOOSE CAREFULLY.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.427
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.

17:33.510 --> 17:34.845
{\an8}I AM DEFINITELY GLAD I WON
THE FLASH CHALLENGE

17:34.928 --> 17:37.556
{\an8}TO BE ABLE TO PICK
MY CANVAS OUT.

17:37.639 --> 17:38.766
{\an8}- MY MAIN FOCUS IS AN EAGLE
AND SOME ROSES

17:38.849 --> 17:40.017
{\an8}AND MAYBE SOME VINES,
YOU KNOW.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.102
{\an8}- EVERYBODY BETTER HAVE
THEIR "A" GAME ON.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.270
{\an8}YOU BETTER ZONE IN
AND GET YOUR [bleep] TOGETHER.

17:43.353 --> 17:46.231
{\an8}I'M DEFINITELY GONNA STICK
IT TO SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE

17:46.315 --> 17:47.232
{\an8}WHO GOT IT COMING.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.234
{\an8}- I WANT A PORTRAIT OF MY

17:49.318 --> 17:51.153
{\an8}MAC SNOW LEOPARD GECKO
ON THE SIDE OF MY HEAD.

17:54.573 --> 17:57.493
{\an8}- A BOUND WOMAN UNDER WATER
BOUND IN SEAWEED.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.453
{\an8}- I DO NOT WANT THE ONE
WITH THE GIRL BOUND.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.663
{\an8}THAT'S SCARY.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.332
{\an8}YOU'VE GOT TO PUT A LOT
OF DETAIL INTO A TIGHT AREA.

18:03.415 --> 18:06.919
{\an8}- I WANT TO GET A ZOMBIE BITE ON
THE BACK OF MY HEAD RIGHT HERE.

18:07.002 --> 18:07.586
{\an8}TRY TO GET AS REALISTIC
AS POSSIBLE.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.671
{\an8}- WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO?

18:09.755 --> 18:11.089
{\an8}- BIOMECHANICAL,
AND I WANT IT TO GO TO

18:11.173 --> 18:12.841
{\an8}MY FACE ONTO MY HEAD.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.969
{\an8}- JIME IS SO UPSET WITH ME
FOR NOT KISSING HIS ASS.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.138
{\an8}BUT JIME DOESN'T THREATEN ME.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.848
{\an8}HE'S A GREAT ARTIST,
BUT SO AM I,

18:19.932 --> 18:22.684
{\an8}AND I'M GONNA WIN THIS
BY BEING A GREAT ARTIST.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.853
{\an8}- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

18:24.937 --> 18:27.773
{\an8}READ THE ARTIST'S NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.858
{\an8}- JOEY.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.194
{\an8}- TATU BABY.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.153
{\an8}- JIME.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.826
{\an8}- JOSHUA.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.202
{\an8}- JIME'S A [bleep] DICK.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.581
{\an8}- KYLE.

18:44.665 --> 18:47.209
{\an8}- HOW MANY REALISTIC
ZOMBIE BITES HAVE YOU SEEN?

18:47.292 --> 18:48.210
{\an8}THIS TATTOO'S
GONNA BE DIFFICULT.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.254
{\an8}- REMEMBER, ARTISTS,
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

18:50.337 --> 18:53.173
{\an8}WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST

18:53.257 --> 18:55.050
{\an8}AND PUT ONE ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.303
{\an8}AFTER YOU CONSULT
WITH YOUR HUMAN CANVASES,

18:58.387 --> 19:00.138
{\an8}YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO COMPLETE YOUR HEAD TATTOO.

19:00.222 --> 19:04.560
{\an8}BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL BE CLOSING SHOP.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.229
{\an8}GOOD LUCK.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.898
{\an8}- FINESSE IS DEFINITELY
GONNA COME INTO PLAY IN THIS

19:09.982 --> 19:12.609
{\an8}PARTICULAR ELIMINATION, BECAUSE
HEAD TATTOOS ARE PAINFUL.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.861
- HAVE YOU TATTOOED
A HEAD BEFORE?

19:13.944 --> 19:15.070
- YEAH.
- COOL.

19:15.153 --> 19:16.947
- SO IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT
OF BEDSIDE MANNER

19:17.030 --> 19:18.448
TO BE ABLE TO KEEP
THEIR CLIENT'S CALM AND COOL

19:18.532 --> 19:22.411
THROUGHOUT THE SESSION AND
REALLY SHOW US WHAT THEY HAVE.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.954
- HOW MUCH PAIN
CAN YOU HANDLE?

19:24.037 --> 19:25.163
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE GOT
QUITE A FEW TATTOOS.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.207
- I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING
ON MY HEAD, BUT YOU KNOW,

19:27.291 --> 19:28.417
WE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.459
- DO YOU HAVE ANY,
LIKE, TOUGH SPOTS,

19:29.543 --> 19:30.586
YOU HAVE YOUR RIBS DONE OR...

19:30.669 --> 19:32.504
- YEAH, MY NECK,
MY KNUCKLES.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.047
- I'VE TATTOOED HEADS BEFORE,

19:34.131 --> 19:35.841
AND THEY DEFINITELY SAID
IT WAS A TOUGH SPOT.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.092
SO JUST MENTALLY PREPARE
YOURSELF.

19:37.175 --> 19:38.010
- USUALLY, I TRY TO
STAY AWAY FROM TATTOOING

19:38.093 --> 19:40.804
PEOPLE'S FACES, BECAUSE,
OBVIOUSLY,

19:40.888 --> 19:42.681
THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT THINGS
A LOT STRONGER

19:42.764 --> 19:43.932
THAN GETTING YOUR HEAD TATTOOED,

19:44.016 --> 19:45.934
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M
DEALING WITH SOMEBODY THAT

19:46.018 --> 19:49.771
ISN'T 18 AND ALREADY HAS
A LOT OF VISIBLE TATTOOS--

19:49.855 --> 19:51.273
I THINK IT WOULD BE
DISRESPECTFUL FOR ME

19:51.356 --> 19:52.274
TO TRY TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.776
{\an8}- I DON'T REALLY LIKE
DOING FACE TATTOOS.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.278
{\an8}BUT THIS GUY IS IN A PLACE
IN HIS LIFE

19:56.361 --> 19:57.988
{\an8}WHERE MY OPINION
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER,

19:58.071 --> 19:59.615
{\an8}AND I'M GONNA SHUT UP
AND JUST GIVE IT TO HIM.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.199
{\an8}- THIS IS REALLY
A COMFORTABLE DAY FOR ME.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.492
{\an8}I CAN'T WAIT TO GET INTO IT.

20:02.576 --> 20:03.619
{\an8}- SO WHAT WAS YOUR IDEA?

20:03.702 --> 20:05.162
{\an8}YOU WANT A BOND GIRL?

20:05.245 --> 20:08.498
{\an8}- A BOUND WOMAN UNDER WATER
BOUND IN SEAWEED

20:08.582 --> 20:10.626
{\an8}IN AN OYSTER WITH A PEARL.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.961
{\an8}THAT'S WHERE THE SEAWEED
IS COMING OUT FROM.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.547
{\an8}- I WOULD NEVER DO
A PINUP THIS SMALL.

20:15.631 --> 20:18.508
BY US TRYING TO INCORPORATE
A WHOLE BODY ON THE HEAD,

20:18.592 --> 20:20.427
THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA BE
REALLY TRICKY.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.054
WHEN YOU, LIKE, PUT SO MUCH
IN ONE PIECE,

20:22.137 --> 20:24.139
IT IS HARDER TO READ
THAN WHEN YOU STEP BACK

20:24.222 --> 20:25.641
AND DO SOMETHING
THAT'S MORE CLEAR.

20:25.724 --> 20:29.061
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GIVE
MY CANVAS EVERYTHING SHE WANTS

20:29.144 --> 20:30.979
IN SUCH A SMALL TATTOO.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.148
I'M IN TROUBLE.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.250
- OH, LOOK AT YOU.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.001
- I'M SO SCARED.
- OH.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.544
- HOLY [bleep].

20:54.628 --> 20:55.879
THAT SCAR IS GNARLY.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.923
MY CANVAS,
HE'S GOT A 1-INCH SCAR.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.883
IT RUNS RIGHT THROUGH THE AREA
THAT WE NEED TO TATTOO.

20:59.967 --> 21:03.220
I'VE GOT AN EXTRA CHALLENGE NOW.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.639
I HAD A COUPLE OF IDEAS
UNTIL I SEEN THAT SCAR.

21:05.722 --> 21:08.266
- IF I RUN A LINE THAT'S
DIRECTLY OVER THE TOP OF THAT,

21:08.350 --> 21:10.894
YOU RUN THE RISK OF THAT WHOLE
SCAR TURNING THAT SAME TISSUE,

21:10.978 --> 21:11.853
SO YOU BASICALLY DEFINITELY
HAVE TO FINESSE.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.064
{\an8}IT'S GONNA BE SUPER DIFFICULT.

21:14.147 --> 21:15.357
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE I JUST
SCREWED MYSELF.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.701
{\an8}- JUST A LITTLE BIT
COMPARED TO THE HAND.

21:25.784 --> 21:29.037
{\an8}SEE HOW MUCH BIGGER
YOUR FOOT IS THAN YOUR HAND.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.873
{\an8}TATU BABY'S DESIGN
IS [bleep] JACKED.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.376
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS HAND?

21:34.459 --> 21:36.753
{\an8}- IS THAT ONE OR TWO HANDS?

21:36.837 --> 21:39.381
{\an8}SHADE THAT ONE DARKER
THAN THE OTHER ONES,

21:39.464 --> 21:41.383
{\an8}SO THAT WAY, IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE SEPARATE HANDS.

21:41.466 --> 21:44.386
{\an8}- I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH
TIME TO FINISH MY DESIGN.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.388
{\an8}I'M REALLY SCARED
THAT THE JUDGES

21:46.471 --> 21:49.266
{\an8}ARE GONNA RIP ME APART.

21:49.349 --> 21:52.894
{\an8}- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO CREATE A HEAD TATTOO,

21:52.978 --> 21:55.981
{\an8}AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.149
{\an8}- RIGHT ON.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.900
{\an8}- I'M JUST GONNA HAVE YOU STAND
OVER HERE.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.068
{\an8}- WE WANT TO SEE THESE ARTISTS
GETTING THE DESIGN

22:00.152 --> 22:02.988
{\an8}ONTO THE HEAD,
HAVING IT FIT WELL,

22:03.071 --> 22:05.282
{\an8}AND THEN TECHNICALLY NOT
PUTTING THE CLIENT

22:05.365 --> 22:08.243
{\an8}IN SO MUCH PAIN THAT THEY
CAN'T FINISH THE TATTOO.

22:08.326 --> 22:09.077
{\an8}A LITTLE BIT OF FINESSE
GOES A LONG WAY

22:09.161 --> 22:11.038
{\an8}IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.247
{\an8}- [bleep] YEAH.

22:12.330 --> 22:14.416
{\an8}- [chuckle]

22:14.499 --> 22:16.543
{\an8}- MY CANVAS WANTS TO PUT
A ZOMBIE BITE

22:16.626 --> 22:17.919
{\an8}ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.338
MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS HOW
I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY

22:20.422 --> 22:23.759
SPENDING SIX HOURS ON JUST
THIS ONE SKULL BITE.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.385
- GOOD. NICE.

22:25.469 --> 22:26.887
- THIS IS NOT THE TIME
TO DROP THE BALL.

22:26.970 --> 22:29.014
- YOU READY, SIR?

22:29.097 --> 22:31.391
{\an5}- AS MUCH AS I'M GONNA BE,
YEAH.

22:37.230 --> 22:38.940
- I'M VERY NERVOUS
STARTING THIS TATTOO.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.942
THE SMALLER YOU DO DETAIL,

22:41.026 --> 22:43.195
THE HARDER IT IS
TO PULL IT OFF RIGHT.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.947
{\an8}YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.950
{\an8}EVERYTHING IN MY HEAD RIGHT
NOW HAS LED ME TO SMALL TATTOOS.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.160
THIS IS NOT
THE BEST WAY TO GO.

22:50.243 --> 22:52.037
THIS IS GONNA SEND YOU
TO THE BOTTOM.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.955
- IS IT COMING ALONG?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.540
- SO FAR SO GOOD.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.042
I'VE JUST GOT TO DEAL
WITH WHAT I'VE GOT

22:57.125 --> 22:58.794
AND ROCK THIS WITH CONFIDENCE.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.965
- ONE OF MY FIRST INSTINCTS
WAS TO TRY TO DESIGN SOMETHING

23:04.049 --> 23:06.301
THAT COULD GO AROUND THE SCAR,

23:06.384 --> 23:08.386
BUT IT WASN'T WHAT
HE WAS ASKING FOR,

23:08.470 --> 23:11.556
SO I'M GONNA USE FINESSE AND
JUST HIDE IT WITHIN THE WINGS.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.850
WORKING WITH THIS SCAR
IS TRIPPING ME OUT.

23:13.934 --> 23:14.392
- OH, THERE'S A SCAR THERE?

23:14.476 --> 23:16.686
- YOU'RE [bleep] ME.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.522
- WHEN HE SHAVED HIS HEAD,
DUDE, IT'S LIKE--

23:18.605 --> 23:19.481
- OH, WOW.

23:19.564 --> 23:22.567
- THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR MISTAKES RIGHT NOW.

23:22.651 --> 23:23.485
I HAVE TO BE 100% ON POINT.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.406
- FOUR HOURS TO GO,
EVERYBODY.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.037
{\an8}- EVERYBODY THINKS
THAT I'M NOT AN ARTIST

23:34.121 --> 23:36.456
{\an8}AND THAT I CAN'T DRAW ANYTHING,

23:36.540 --> 23:38.416
{\an8}BUT I'M GONNA PROVE THESE PEOPLE
WRONG WITH THIS TATTOO.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.336
{\an8}- WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A VISIT
FROM THE PEANUT GALLERY.

23:41.419 --> 23:43.547
{\an8}THAT'S WHAT I CALL THE JUDGES.
WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

23:43.630 --> 23:44.840
{\an8}- WHAT YOU DOIN' IN HERE, BUD?

23:44.923 --> 23:46.007
{\an8}- TATTOOING SOMEBODY'S HEAD.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.509
{\an8}IT'S NO JOKE.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.511
{\an8}- JOSH IS DOING BIOMECHANICAL.

23:49.594 --> 23:52.848
{\an8}MY CONCERN WITH THIS IS THE FACT
THAT JOSH IS NOT A GREAT ARTIST

23:52.931 --> 23:54.141
{\an8}WHEN IT COMES TO DRAWING.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.476
HIS DESIGN, THERE'S NOT
MUCH TO IT, AND TO ME,

23:56.560 --> 23:58.478
THIS IS ALL FROSTING
AND NO CAKE.

23:58.562 --> 24:00.605
- SEE YOU GUYS AROUND.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.234
- LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.319
LET'S JUST SAY YOU'RE IN
THIS COMPETITION.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.905
YOU SEE SOMEBODY THAT YOU KNOW
IS DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.407
WOULD YOU TELL THEM?

24:10.490 --> 24:11.700
- HMM.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.910
- I JUST CAN'T STOP THINKING
IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD

24:13.994 --> 24:15.370
THAT I SHOT MYSELF
IN THE FOOT.

24:15.453 --> 24:16.746
IT'S $100,000.

24:16.830 --> 24:17.873
IF I HAVE TO GO HOME,
AND SHE DOESN'T GO HOME

24:17.956 --> 24:19.875
BECAUSE I HELPED HER...

24:19.958 --> 24:22.085
- IT IS, LIKE,
A TOUGH CHOICE, THOUGH.

24:22.169 --> 24:25.714
- I SHOULD JUST
KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.

24:25.797 --> 24:26.548
- TWO MORE HOURS, GUYS.

24:34.055 --> 24:34.973
- I'M LOOKING AT IT,
AND WITH ALL THE RED

24:35.056 --> 24:36.474
AND THE PINK OF THE BRAIN,

24:36.558 --> 24:39.811
IT LOOKS LIKE AN OPEN MOUTH
MISSING ITS TEETH.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.980
SO I'M GONNA PUT A THIRD
BITE MARK ON THERE.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.940
I'M HOPING THAT THIS
WILL MAKE IT LOOK LIKE

24:44.024 --> 24:44.608
SOMETHING'S BEEN GNAWING ON IT.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.612
{\an8}- I THOUGHT IT WAS
A SMILE A LITTLE BIT, BUT...

24:48.695 --> 24:49.988
- YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A SMILE?

24:50.071 --> 24:52.616
- KYLE'S IS REALLY WEIRD
AND HARD TO READ.

24:52.699 --> 24:55.243
IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
AN ACTUAL ZOMBIE ATTACK.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.245
AT THIS POINT, YOU HAVE TO
DO BETTER THAN THAT

24:57.329 --> 24:59.915
TO STAY IN THIS COMPETITION.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.333
- 30 MINUTES REMAINING.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.503
- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SHOW
FINESSE AND GO VERY SOFT

25:05.587 --> 25:09.382
IN THIS TATTOO, BUT MY CANVAS
IS STILL IN A LOT OF PAIN.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.134
- [groans]

25:11.218 --> 25:13.637
- I'M NOT GOING TO LET HER
TAP OUT.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.263
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.098
IT IS CRITICAL FOR ME
TO FINISH THIS TATTOO.

25:17.182 --> 25:22.145
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX,

25:22.229 --> 25:27.817
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

25:27.901 --> 25:28.652
THAT'S IT.
TIME'S UP.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.987
NO MORE INK.
MACHINES DOWN, PLEASE.

25:31.071 --> 25:33.657
- YOU'VE DONE GREAT.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.033
- [gasp]

25:35.116 --> 25:37.202
- I COULD NOT TAKE A SIXTH
HOUR OF TATTOOING MY HEAD,

25:37.285 --> 25:38.954
NO WAY.

25:40.247 --> 25:40.830
- READY FOR THIS?

25:40.914 --> 25:44.084
- YEAH.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.961
OH, WOW.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.923
- I THINK YOU NAILED IT.

25:50.006 --> 25:53.969
- TATU BABY'S TATTOO
IS OVERWHELMINGLY FLAWED.

25:54.052 --> 25:54.636
THE HEAD'S TOO BIG.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.221
THE ANATOMY IS A LITTLE OFF.

25:56.304 --> 25:58.014
THE TOES ARE FRICKIN' WEIRD.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.183
SHE'S STILL SHOWING
HER WEAKNESSES.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.143
TATU BABY SHOULD
DEFINITELY BE GOING HOME.

26:05.313 --> 26:06.356
{\an8}- YOU SHOULD GO HOME.
- TATU BABY HAD THE MOST ISSUES.

26:06.439 --> 26:08.149
{\an8}I'M GOING TO BE IN
THE FINAL THREE.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.484
{\an8}- IT'S JOSH,
AND THAT'S IT.

26:09.567 --> 26:12.028
- THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS
THAT LOOKS LIKE

26:12.112 --> 26:13.363
AN ADULT DREW IT.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.156
NOBODY ELSE DID LINE WORK
THIS [bleep].

26:15.240 --> 26:16.992
- THIS HAS GOT YOU
IN THE DOGHOUSE.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.159
- [exhales]

26:21.579 --> 26:23.665
- TATTOOING THE HEAD
WAS REALLY CHALLENGING FOR ME.

26:23.748 --> 26:26.209
LIKE, IT WAS TOUGH.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.335
I'M WORRIED.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.754
I'M WORRIED, BECAUSE DRAWING
THAT PINUP THAT SMALL

26:29.838 --> 26:33.049
AND ALL THOSE LITTLE DETAILS
AND PUTTING IT ON HER HEAD

26:33.133 --> 26:34.467
AND ALL THOSE LITTLE
FINGERS AND FEET.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.845
- THE ONE LITTLE FINGER,
AGAIN,

26:36.928 --> 26:38.430
SOMETHING WITH PINKY FINGERS
AND YOU.

26:38.513 --> 26:41.433
- IF I GOT ELIMINATED, I'D BE
PRETTY DISAPPOINTED, YOU KNOW?

26:41.516 --> 26:43.018
- YEAH, YOU MADE IT
THIS FAR LAST YEAR.

26:43.101 --> 26:46.229
YOUR TRUE GOAL IS TO MAKE IT TO
WHERE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN BEFORE.

26:46.313 --> 26:49.190
- LAST SEASON, THERE WAS NO
REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T HAVE WON

26:49.274 --> 26:51.526
THE WHOLE THING,
YOU KNOW?

26:51.609 --> 26:53.194
- OH, MY GOD.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.279
TATU BABY IS FULL OF [bleep].

26:54.362 --> 26:56.531
{\an8}SHE'S SO FAKE, AND IT'S [bleep]
GETTING ANNOYING,

26:56.614 --> 26:59.409
{\an8}AND I THINK SHE SHOULD
SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.077
- AND IF I MAKE IT,

27:01.161 --> 27:03.204
I'M STILL GONNA UNDERSTAND
THAT I STILL HAVE

27:03.288 --> 27:06.541
A LOT MORE TO LEARN AND CONTINUE
GROWING AS AN ARTIST.

27:06.624 --> 27:08.543
- ALL RIGHT.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.477
- ARTISTS, TODAY YOU HAD
TO SHOW YOUR ABILITY

27:25.560 --> 27:27.145
TO USE FINESSE BY TATTOOING
A CHALLENGING PART

27:27.228 --> 27:30.440
OF THE BODY--THE HEAD.

27:30.523 --> 27:33.651
JIME, LET'S START WITH YOU.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.571
HOW WAS THIS FOR YOU,
TATTOOING THE HEAD?

27:36.654 --> 27:38.406
- IT WAS AWESOME
UNTIL HE CAME BACK,

27:38.490 --> 27:40.033
AND HE HAD ABOUT A 1-INCH SCAR

27:40.116 --> 27:42.994
JUST RIGHT FROM WHERE
THE EAGLE'S HEAD STARTS

27:43.078 --> 27:44.537
ALL THE WAY BACK
WRAPPING AROUND.

27:44.621 --> 27:45.580
- EXCELLENT JOB
TATTOOING OVER THE SCAR.

27:45.663 --> 27:48.583
THE WAY YOU WERE ABLE
TO SEAMLESSLY BLEND OVER

27:48.666 --> 27:50.460
THE TOP OF IT, IT REALLY HIDES
THE FACT THAT THE SCAR

27:50.543 --> 27:51.753
IS EVEN THERE AT ALL.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.922
AS FAR AS HOW THE EAGLE FITS
THE HEAD, I LIKE THE WINGS

27:54.005 --> 27:55.215
{\an5}AND THE EAGLE HEAD
AND THE BEAK,

27:55.298 --> 27:56.424
AND EVERYTHING LOOKS VERY COOL,

27:56.508 --> 27:57.926
BUT I JUST THINK
IT'S A LITTLE BIT STRANGE

27:58.009 --> 27:59.928
HOW THIS LEG KIND OF JUST
TUCKS IN RIGHT THERE.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.429
- TUCKING IT UNDER THE EAR,

28:01.513 --> 28:03.390
YOU SHORTED YOURSELF
ON THE COMPOSITION.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.891
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THE OTHER CLAW.

28:04.974 --> 28:06.601
IF YOU COULD HAVE FIT
THAT OTHER CLAW IN,

28:06.684 --> 28:08.436
IT WOULD'VE JUST MADE IT
SO MUCH MORE DYNAMIC.

28:11.731 --> 28:14.526
- KYLE.

28:14.609 --> 28:16.569
- WHAT MADE YOU DO THE
SMALLER BITES ON EITHER SIDE?

28:16.653 --> 28:19.280
- I JUST FIGURED
THAT A ZOMBIE,

28:19.364 --> 28:21.616
IF HE GOT THROUGH ON THE
FIRST BITE, IT WOULD BE ODD,

28:21.699 --> 28:23.952
LIKE, HE MIGHT NEED TO
WARM UP ALMOST.

28:24.035 --> 28:26.955
- THE OTHER TWO LITTLE BITES
ARE A LITTLE BIT WEIRD ON ME.

28:27.038 --> 28:29.124
ANYTHING THAT I WISH WASN'T
THERE WERE THOSE TWO.

28:29.207 --> 28:32.043
- THE PROBLEM WITH THIS TATTOO
IS THE INCONSISTENCIES

28:32.127 --> 28:34.629
IN THE CONCEPTION OF THE DESIGN.

28:34.712 --> 28:37.298
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE TWO
DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT GROUPINGS.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.801
- I KIND OF FELT LIKE A ZOMBIE
ISN'T GONNA GIVE A [bleep]

28:39.884 --> 28:41.261
ABOUT WHERE IT BITES.

28:41.344 --> 28:43.388
IT'S NOT GONNA BE, LIKE, "OH,
THIS IS OUT OF COMPOSITION.

28:43.471 --> 28:44.472
I'M NOT GONNA START HERE."

28:44.556 --> 28:45.890
- WITH THE TEETH BEING SO EVEN,
FROM A DISTANCE,

28:45.974 --> 28:48.935
THE FIRST THING I THINK ABOUT
IS THAT THE DUDE GOT STOMPED

28:49.018 --> 28:50.145
BY A BOOT, AND THEN A ZOMBIE
CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

28:50.228 --> 28:53.106
IT WOULD'VE BEEN A STRONGER
TATTOO IF THOSE TWO THINGS

28:53.189 --> 28:54.399
WERE LEFT OUT,
BECAUSE THAT WAY,

28:54.482 --> 28:59.320
THE FOCAL POINT WOULD HAVE BEEN
THAT MAIN BITE.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.989
- JOEY.

29:01.072 --> 29:04.325
- I LIKE THE PLACEMENT,
AND THE CURVATURE OF THE GECKO

29:04.409 --> 29:05.952
GOES WITH THE SHAPE OF HER HEAD.

29:06.035 --> 29:07.412
I THINK THAT'S
A REALLY GOOD DESIGN.

29:07.495 --> 29:09.622
- IT REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE
IT'S SITTING ON THE HEAD.

29:09.706 --> 29:10.874
I KNOW YOU HAD A BUNCH OF
DIFFERENT PHOTOS OF THIS LIZARD.

29:10.957 --> 29:14.043
TO PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER
TO COMPILE THIS POSITION,

29:14.127 --> 29:15.378
BANG UP JOB, MAN.

29:15.462 --> 29:17.505
THE ANATOMY IS GREAT.
THE LINE WORK IS GREAT.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.215
THE DETAIL IS GREAT.
THE SHADING IS GREAT.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.967
THE COLOR IS GREAT,
THE CONTRAST.

29:21.050 --> 29:22.677
YOU HIT ALMOST
EVERY SINGLE CHALLENGE

29:22.760 --> 29:24.846
THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE
COMPETITION ON THIS ONE TATTOO.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.389
I THINK YOU TOTALLY NAILED IT.

29:26.473 --> 29:27.640
- I DON'T FEEL LIKE THESE GUYS.

29:27.724 --> 29:28.933
I'M THE ODD MAN OUT.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.727
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY THAT
YOU HAVE THE OUTLINE

29:30.810 --> 29:32.228
ON THIS TATTOO,
AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS--

29:32.312 --> 29:33.938
I WAS USING DIFFERENT
LINE WEIGHTS ALSO.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.857
I MEAN I KNOW IT'S--
- NO, BUT THAT FOOT.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.860
LOOK HOW MANY DIFFERENT SIZE
LINES ARE ON THAT FOOT

29:38.943 --> 29:40.862
AND THE BALLS ON THE OUTLINE
OF THAT WEIRD TOE

29:40.945 --> 29:41.863
THAT COMES OUT THE BACK--

29:41.946 --> 29:43.364
- ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT THE SHADOW,

29:43.448 --> 29:44.866
OR ARE YOU SAYING
IT COMES TO A BALL?

29:44.949 --> 29:46.201
- OH, NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT--
LOOK AT THAT BACK WEIRD TOE.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.286
LOOK AT THAT POINT ON
THE TOP OF THAT BACK WEIRD TOE.

29:48.369 --> 29:49.204
IT'S JUST A DOT.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.206
I'VE SEEN YOU DO
SOME AMAZING OUTLINES

29:51.289 --> 29:52.540
THROUGHOUT THIS COMPETITION.

29:52.624 --> 29:56.711
THIS, TO ME, IN MY OPINION,
IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

29:56.794 --> 29:58.880
- TATU BABY.

30:02.383 --> 30:04.969
HOW WELL DO YOU FEEL
YOU EXECUTED THIS TATTOO?

30:05.053 --> 30:06.471
- IT WAS PRETTY CHALLENGING
FOR ME.

30:06.554 --> 30:08.264
THERE WERE CERTAIN SPOTS
WHERE SHE WAS CRYING,

30:08.348 --> 30:10.058
BUT HOPEFULLY,
I HELPED HER SOOTHE THROUGH IT.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.143
- YOU USED FINESSE
WITH YOUR CANVAS.

30:12.227 --> 30:13.520
- IT WAS A DIFFICULT PIECE.

30:13.603 --> 30:14.896
I LIKED THE WAY
YOU DESIGNED HER,

30:14.979 --> 30:16.606
WHERE SHE'S BOUND,
AND HER LEGS ARE UP.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.775
THE ONLY THING I'M HAVING
TROUBLE WITH IS THAT LINE

30:18.858 --> 30:20.652
THAT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S A PART OF HER BUTT CHEEK,

30:20.735 --> 30:22.028
AND THEN THE LINE GOING DOWN,

30:22.111 --> 30:23.655
IT LOOKS LIKE THE BACK
OF HER LEG.

30:23.738 --> 30:25.740
IF I LOOK AT A TATTOO,
AND I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

30:25.823 --> 30:26.908
WHAT'S GOING ON,
THAT'S NOT A SUCCESSFUL TATTOO.

30:26.991 --> 30:29.285
- ONE OF THE REOCCURRING
ISSUES WITH YOUR TATTOOS

30:29.369 --> 30:30.370
IS LINE WORK.

30:30.453 --> 30:32.413
LOOK AT THOSE HANDS.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.415
LOOK AT THE LINES
IN THE SEAWEED.

30:34.499 --> 30:38.378
NOBODY ELSE DID LINE WORK
THAT [bleep], NOBODY.

30:38.461 --> 30:39.462
- IT'S NOT A BAD TATTOO.

30:39.546 --> 30:44.676
I DO FEEL THAT YOU HAVE
PROBABLY MORE CONSISTENCY

30:44.759 --> 30:45.635
IN YOUR LINE WEIGHT
THAN POTENTIALLY JOEY

30:45.718 --> 30:48.596
FOR ME BEATING UP
JOEY'S OUTLINE.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.933
HOWEVER, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
COVERING UP INCONSISTENCIES

30:52.016 --> 30:54.102
JUST BY THE APPROACH
OF THE SHADING THAT YOU TOOK,

30:54.185 --> 30:57.814
TRYING TO PACK AREAS WITH
THIS BLUE THAT IS INCONSISTENT.

30:57.897 --> 31:01.276
THAT IS A HARD, HARD, HARD,
COLOR TO MAKE LOOK GREAT.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.652
AND YOU TOOK
A BEAUTIFUL STRUCTURE,

31:02.735 --> 31:05.613
AND YOU MUDDIED IT UP.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.031
- JOSHUA.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.870
YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY VOCAL
ABOUT NOT TATTOOING FACES.

31:12.954 --> 31:16.124
DO YOU THINK THAT JIME
GAVE THIS TO YOU INTENTIONALLY?

31:16.207 --> 31:18.543
- I DON'T KNOW IF HE
THOUGHT TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.003
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY'S HERE
TO COMPETE

31:20.086 --> 31:22.213
AND HAS A LITTLE BIT OF RESPECT
FOR EACH OTHER.

31:22.297 --> 31:23.715
- JIME,
YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD NO?

31:23.798 --> 31:25.675
- THE FACT THAT THERE'S RESPECT.

31:25.758 --> 31:27.135
- I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT HOW--
THE WAY I FEEL, SO...

31:27.218 --> 31:28.303
- OH, OKAY.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.763
- AS FAR AS THE ACTUAL DESIGN
AND THE SHAPES OF THIS,

31:30.847 --> 31:33.433
YOUR INITIAL OUTLINE DRAWING
COULD HAVE BEEN

31:33.516 --> 31:35.935
A LITTLE MORE CREATIVE,
BUT YOU MADE UP FOR THAT

31:36.019 --> 31:38.146
IN HOW MUCH DETAIL
YOU PUT INTO IT.

31:38.229 --> 31:40.315
YOU REALLY BROUGHT THAT
TO LIFE WITH THESE KIND OF

31:40.398 --> 31:42.483
SURREAL,
BONE-LIKE TEXTURES.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.445
TECHNICALLY, YOU HIT A LOT
OF REALLY STRONG MARKS.

31:45.528 --> 31:47.530
- WOW.
- THANK YOU.

31:47.614 --> 31:48.823
{\an5}- I'M GONNA BE THE DICK,
DUDE.

31:48.906 --> 31:49.449
I CAN'T STAND THIS DRAWING.

31:49.532 --> 31:51.743
I REALLY DISLIKE IT.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.328
YOU ARE A TECHNICAL TATTOOER.

31:53.411 --> 31:54.996
I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU
LAST WEEK AND THE WEEK BEFORE,

31:55.079 --> 31:58.499
BECAUSE YOU DID THINGS
THAT WERE YOUR WORLD.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.753
{\an1}YOU PULL OFF AMAZING THINGS WHEN
YOU ARE REPLICATING SOMETHING,

32:01.836 --> 32:05.089
BUT THIS DRAWING DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE AN ADULT DRAWING.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.507
THIS LOOKS LIKE
A KID DRAWING.

32:06.591 --> 32:08.259
- I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
IF I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

32:08.343 --> 32:09.719
I SPENT PLENTY OF TIME
DRAWING IT.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.638
IT HAS A VERY SPECIFIC FEEL--
- NO, IT DOESN'T, MAN.

32:11.721 --> 32:13.014
WHAT IS THE SHAPE?

32:13.097 --> 32:16.225
I'D BE PISSED RIGHT NOW
IF I WAS WEARING THIS.

32:16.309 --> 32:17.185
- IT'S A GOOD THING
I DIDN'T PUT IT ON YOU.

32:17.268 --> 32:19.479
- I WOULD SERIOUSLY HAVE ISSUE
WITH YOU.

32:19.562 --> 32:21.898
DUDE, YOU CAN COPY
A [bleep] PORTRAIT,

32:21.981 --> 32:25.193
YOU CAN COPY A COMIC BOOK,
YOU CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS,

32:25.276 --> 32:28.821
BUT THIS DRAWING STUFF
HAS GOT YOU IN THE DOGHOUSE.

32:32.950 --> 32:34.994
- [exhale]

32:35.078 --> 32:36.746
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

32:36.829 --> 32:38.206
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW.

32:38.289 --> 32:41.376
THEIR VOTE WILL PUT ONE OF YOU
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.752
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,

32:42.835 --> 32:44.671
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

32:51.427 --> 32:53.304
- OH, MAN.

32:55.098 --> 32:57.725
- WELL, IT WAS GREAT
TO KNOW YOU GUYS.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.435
- THINK YOU'RE GOING HOME
FOR SURE YOU'RE THINKING OR...

32:59.519 --> 33:00.228
- YEAH.
- YOU THINK SO?

33:00.311 --> 33:02.188
- DID YOU HEAR
ALL HE WAS SAYING?

33:02.271 --> 33:03.981
"THAT LOOKS LIKE [beep].
I [bleep] HATE THIS."

33:04.065 --> 33:05.650
- DO YOU THINK
KYLE'S CRITIQUE WAS HARSHER

33:05.733 --> 33:07.568
THAN THE ONE CHRIS GAVE HIM?

33:07.652 --> 33:09.070
- HONESTLY, AT THIS POINT,

33:09.153 --> 33:10.655
I'M GONNA SAY
YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

33:10.738 --> 33:12.740
- BUT LOOKING AT, TECHNICALLY,
WHO HAD THE MOST ISSUES,

33:12.824 --> 33:14.075
THEN IT WOULD BE TATU BABY.

33:14.158 --> 33:17.328
- HONESTLY, IT'S JOSH,
AND THAT'S IT.

33:17.412 --> 33:19.330
- NOW I'M GETTING WORRIED,
BECAUSE WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN WRONG.

33:19.414 --> 33:24.001
[chuckling]

33:24.085 --> 33:25.253
- "[bleep] JOSHUA.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.755
HE DESERVES TO GO HOME BECAUSE,
WE ALL HATE HIM."

33:27.839 --> 33:29.215
AND IF IT'S WHO
THE BEST TATTOO,

33:29.298 --> 33:31.092
I'M GOING TO BE IN
THE FINAL THREE,

33:31.175 --> 33:33.136
AND THEY JUST HAVE TO WAIT
AND SEE.

33:38.307 --> 33:41.352
- TODAY'S CHALLENGE WAS HEAD
TATTOOS AND USE OF FINESSE.

33:41.436 --> 33:42.645
LET'S START OFF WITH JIME.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.731
THIS, TO ME, IS ONE OF
THE CLEANER ONES OF THE DAY.

33:44.814 --> 33:46.691
- WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT,
IT'S POWERFUL, IT'S SOLID.

33:46.774 --> 33:47.650
THE DESIGN'S THERE.

33:47.734 --> 33:48.860
THE COLOR CHOICES ARE GREAT.

33:48.943 --> 33:51.237
THE BETTER THE TATTOO, THE MORE
IT LOOKS LIKE A STICKER.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.614
- LET'S MOVE TO KYLE
WITH THE ZOMBIE BITE.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.241
- KYLE DID AN OKAY TATTOO.

33:55.324 --> 33:58.536
AND THERE ARE DEFINITE LITTLE
AREAS OF FINESSE IN THIS THING,

33:58.619 --> 34:00.413
THE LITTLE VEINS THAT ACTUALLY
LOOK LIKE VEINS.

34:00.496 --> 34:03.499
AESTHETICALLY, IT NEEDS TO HAVE
A LITTLE MORE UNIFORMITY,

34:03.583 --> 34:07.295
AND IT LOOKS LIKE A FOOTPRINT
MORE SO THAN A ZOMBIE BITE.

34:07.378 --> 34:08.212
- LET'S MOVE TO TATU BABY.

34:08.295 --> 34:09.630
THE VINE THAT COMES
OUT OF HER BUTT,

34:09.714 --> 34:11.924
IT'S TOTALLY SCRIBBLY.

34:12.007 --> 34:15.178
ANY SPOT THAT YOU PICK ON
THIS TATTOO JUST LOOKS BEAT.

34:15.261 --> 34:17.638
- YOUR CONVICTION TOWARDS
THIS TATTOO IS WHAT I FEEL

34:17.722 --> 34:19.139
ABOUT SOME OF
THE OTHER TATTOOS.

34:19.223 --> 34:22.268
WE'VE SEEN JOEY DO SOME AMAZING
STUFF IN THIS COMPETITION,

34:22.351 --> 34:24.395
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF
INCONSISTENCIES IN THIS.

34:24.478 --> 34:26.313
- TELL ME WHY, BRO,
BECAUSE TO ME, IT LOOKS GOOD.

34:26.397 --> 34:28.608
LOOK AT THOSE JACKED-UP LINES
ON THOSE CLAWS.

34:28.690 --> 34:30.818
LOOK AT THE LEFT SIDE
OF THE SPIKES ON THE TAIL.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.820
WHERE IS THE RIGHT SIDE
OF THOSE SPIKES?

34:32.904 --> 34:35.239
- THESE FINGERS
ON THIS LIZARD ARE--

34:35.322 --> 34:38.159
I THINK THIS IS
A VERY NICELY DETAILED TATTOO.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.159
- I DON'T AGREE.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.036
THIS IS SCRATCHY
AND SHAKY OUTLINING.

34:40.119 --> 34:42.371
I DON'T CARE WHO AGREES
OR DISAGREES.

34:42.455 --> 34:43.371
- I THINK THIS TATTOO
IS A GOOD TATTOO.

34:43.456 --> 34:46.918
- LET'S MOVE TO JOSHUA,
WHO DID THE BIOMECH.

34:47.001 --> 34:47.668
- ALL FROSTING AND NO CAKE.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.295
- OKAY, GREAT, THERE'S TEXTURE,

34:49.378 --> 34:52.632
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA COME HERE,
YOU'VE GOT TO DRAW.

34:52.715 --> 34:53.674
- I TOTALLY DO AGREE.

34:53.757 --> 34:56.844
THE BASIC OUTLINE DRAWING
WAS NOT VERY ARTISTIC,

34:56.928 --> 34:58.805
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF
TECHNICAL TRICKS

34:58.888 --> 35:00.431
THAT REALLY BRING
THIS THING ALIVE.

35:00.515 --> 35:04.310
- THIS IS NOT A DRAWING OF A GUY
WHO IS IN THE FINAL FIVE.

35:04.393 --> 35:06.854
HE'S DONE THE WORST TATTOOS
PICKED BY NON-TATTOOERS...

35:06.938 --> 35:07.939
- THREE TIMES.

35:08.022 --> 35:09.315
- BECAUSE HE'S
THE LEAST ARTISTIC.

35:09.398 --> 35:13.528
- WE'VE GOT ONE ARTIST WHO CAN
TECHNICALLY PACK IN THE COLOR

35:13.611 --> 35:15.363
AND DO SOME TEXTURE
BUT CAN'T DRAW.

35:15.446 --> 35:16.906
WE HAVE ANOTHER TATTOOER WHO'S
A GREAT ARTIST AND CAN DRAW--

35:16.989 --> 35:19.992
- WHO'S THE GREAT ARTIST
THAT CAN DRAW?

35:20.076 --> 35:22.036
- TATU BABY.
- WHAT CAN SHE DRAW?

35:22.119 --> 35:24.163
- SHE CAN DRAW--SHE'S...

35:24.247 --> 35:26.332
- BABY'S TEN TIMES BETTER OF
AN ARTIST ON PAPER THAN JOSHUA.

35:26.415 --> 35:27.542
- THAT WAS MY POINT,
UNTIL HE JUMPED ALL OVER ME.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.377
- A MILLION TIMES BETTER
THAN JOSHUA.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.045
NO, A MILLION TIMES.
- THAT WAS MY POINT.

35:31.128 --> 35:32.296
- AND YOU JUMPED ALL OVER ME--
- JOSHUA DRAWS LIKE A CHILD.

35:32.380 --> 35:35.216
- BE THAT AS IT MAY, SHE
CAN DRAW BETTER THAN JOSHUA.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.717
JOSHUA CAN APPLY
BETTER THAN HER.

35:36.801 --> 35:40.096
WHAT DO WE DO HERE IN TERMS
OF SENDING SOMEBODY HOME?

35:40.179 --> 35:40.763
WHAT TRUMPS THE OTHER THING?

35:40.847 --> 35:42.348
- WE'RE SO FAR FROM UNIFIED.

35:42.431 --> 35:44.892
- LET'S SEE WHAT THE HUMAN
CANVAS JURY COMES UP WITH.

35:44.976 --> 35:45.977
{\an8}- YEAH.

35:46.060 --> 35:49.522
{\an8}- WE ARE HERE TO DECIDE
WHICH TATTOO IS THE WORST.

35:49.605 --> 35:50.231
- KYLE WAS MY ARTIST.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.316
I WAS LOOKING FOR A ZOMBIE BITE.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.901
- I'LL BE HONEST,
I DIDN'T GET IT.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.111
- WHAT THE HELL IS IT?

35:55.194 --> 35:56.279
- FOR LOOKING AT IT, I MEAN,

35:56.362 --> 35:57.738
I GET THE VIBE
THAT YOU'RE SAYING.

35:57.822 --> 36:00.658
NOT TO SOUND RUDE, BUT YOU SEE
THE TWO BITE MARKS ON THE SIDE,

36:00.741 --> 36:01.325
IT LOOKS LIKE A PIZZA OVEN.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.244
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT TOO.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.746
HE COULD'VE ADDED, LIKE, THE
EXTRA VEINS AND STUFF LIKE THAT

36:05.830 --> 36:07.331
TO MAKE IT MORE REALISTIC.

36:07.415 --> 36:08.583
- I'M 100% HAPPY.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.418
IT WAS A DIFFICULT PIECE.

36:10.501 --> 36:12.587
- MY ARTIST WAS TATU BABY.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.797
I ASKED FOR A WOMAN
BOUND IN SEAWEED.

36:14.881 --> 36:15.715
- THE BOTTOM HAND--
- IT'S CONTORTED.

36:15.798 --> 36:17.133
- IT SEEMS DISPROPORTIONATE.

36:17.216 --> 36:18.968
THE TOP HAND KIND OF
TWISTED OVER,

36:19.051 --> 36:21.095
AND THE PINKY
ON THE BOTTOM HAND,

36:21.178 --> 36:22.555
THAT JUST KIND OF
DOESN'T SET RIGHT.

36:22.638 --> 36:23.890
- YEAH, IT'S--

36:23.973 --> 36:25.766
THE HANDS ARE MISPROPORTIONED
AND THE FEET.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.268
- TO ME,
LOOKING AT THAT TATTOO,

36:27.351 --> 36:28.853
PROPORTION-WISE,
IT LOOKS GREAT.

36:28.936 --> 36:31.022
- GREAT FIGURE,
THICK AND NICE BOOTY.

36:31.105 --> 36:34.275
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL, BUT BEAUTIFUL
DOESN'T CUT THE CAKE.

36:34.358 --> 36:35.359
I'M NOT HAPPY WITH IT.

36:35.443 --> 36:36.944
- I'D BE REALLY HAPPY WITH IT.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.279
IT LOOKS GOOD.

36:38.362 --> 36:39.030
I KNOW WHAT THAT IS, AND I
JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOURS WAS,

36:39.113 --> 36:41.574
MAN,
AND THAT'S ALL IT IS.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.075
- JOSHUA WAS MY TATTOO ARTIST.

36:43.159 --> 36:45.870
I WANTED TO HAVE
SOMETHING ORGANIC.

36:45.953 --> 36:47.622
- HOW DID YOU GET THE IDEA
FOR THE BACKGROUND?

36:47.705 --> 36:49.498
- THE BACKGROUND
WAS ACTUALLY HIS.

36:49.582 --> 36:50.708
HE DID ALL THAT.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.627
- I JUST WISH HE WOULD'VE
USED A LITTLE MORE WHITE

36:52.710 --> 36:54.337
IN THE MIDDLE PART, LIKE,
TO ACCENT THE BLUE

36:54.420 --> 36:55.838
TO MAKE THE BLUE POP MORE.

36:55.922 --> 36:57.673
- IT'S NOT MY TYPE
OF TATTOO WHATSOEVER.

36:57.757 --> 36:58.633
I JUST WOULDN'T PUT IT
ON MY BODY.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.509
- I'LL WEAR IT FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

37:00.593 --> 37:01.469
- I THINK HE ROCKED IT.

37:01.552 --> 37:02.637
- WELL, I GUESS THAT'S IT.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.429
THE JURY HAS REACHED A DECISION.

37:07.516 --> 37:10.019
- OH, CRAP.

37:10.102 --> 37:11.979
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

37:13.773 --> 37:17.360
I WANT TO SEE KYLE,
TATU BABY,

37:17.443 --> 37:21.822
JIME...

37:21.906 --> 37:23.658
JOEY, AND JOSHUA.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.660
- [bleep].

37:25.743 --> 37:26.786
- I WANT TO SEE ALL YOU GUYS
IN THE SHOP.

37:26.869 --> 37:29.163
- THAT WAS [bleep] UP.
- YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE SAFE.

37:29.246 --> 37:30.790
I THINK WE'RE ALL
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

37:30.873 --> 37:32.667
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I HAD THAT
FEELING LIKE, "OH [bleep]."

37:32.750 --> 37:34.251
WHO GETS CUT AT FIVE?

37:34.335 --> 37:35.586
- LET'S GO SEE.
- LET'S DO IT.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.129
- FACE THE MUSIC.

37:46.555 --> 37:49.600
- TODAY WE ASKED YOU TO SHOW
YOUR ABILITY TO USE FINESSE

37:49.684 --> 37:51.602
BY TATTOOING
YOUR CANVAS' HEAD.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.646
TWO OF YOU DID
INCREDIBLE TATTOOS

37:53.729 --> 37:56.524
AND ARE ONE STEP CLOSER
TO THE LIVE FINALE.

37:56.607 --> 37:59.110
JIME, JOEY,
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED

37:59.193 --> 38:04.198
THAT THE BEST TATTOO
OF THE DAY...

38:04.281 --> 38:05.282
GOES TO JIME.

38:05.366 --> 38:06.325
- THANK YOU.

38:06.409 --> 38:07.326
- YOU AND JOEY BOTH DID
GREAT TATTOOS.

38:07.410 --> 38:10.162
YOU SHOWED US A LITTLE BIT MORE
WOW FACTOR.

38:10.246 --> 38:12.415
IT WAS BOLDER AND CLEANER
WITH THE LINE WORK.

38:12.498 --> 38:14.875
- THE APPLICATION,
NOBODY CAN DENY, IS JUST CLEAN,

38:14.959 --> 38:16.377
SOLID, TIGHT, TATTOOING.

38:16.460 --> 38:19.046
- APPRECIATE IT, GUYS.
THANK YOU.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.215
- TATU BABY, KYLE, JOSHUA,

38:21.298 --> 38:22.508
ONE OF YOU IS ABOUT
TO CLOSE SHOP.

38:24.802 --> 38:28.014
TATU BABY, YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

38:28.097 --> 38:31.017
VOTED THAT YOU HAD
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.184
- WELL, I--WOW.

38:32.268 --> 38:35.730
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE
TO GET CLEAN LINES IN.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.189
WE'VE EXPECTED YOU TO MAKE
A LEAP

38:37.273 --> 38:39.650
FROM LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR,
AND I'M NOT SEEING IT.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.277
- I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO OVERDO IT

38:41.360 --> 38:42.862
WITH MY TATTOOS,

38:42.945 --> 38:44.405
AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN
DROPPING THE BALL A LITTLE BIT,

38:44.488 --> 38:47.074
BUT I FEEL LIKE I DO DESERVE
ANOTHER CHALLENGE.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.451
I CAN SHOW YOU BLACK AND GRAY.

38:48.534 --> 38:49.076
I CAN SHOW YOU COLOR.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.995
YOU'VE SEEN MY BLENDING.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.329
I CAN [bleep] DRAW MY ASS OFF,

38:52.413 --> 38:56.417
SO I REALLY HOPE YOU GUYS
GIVE ME THE CHANCE.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.626
- KYLE.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.879
- THERE ARE SOME IMPRESSIVE
ATTRIBUTES TO THIS TATTOO,

38:59.962 --> 39:03.007
BUT IT'S ARTISTICALLY AND
COMPOSITIONALLY UNAPPEALING.

39:03.090 --> 39:04.341
OVERALL, YOU'RE JUST
SQUEAKING BY BEING BETTER

39:04.425 --> 39:06.052
THAN SOME PEOPLE
BUT NOT AS GOOD AS OTHERS.

39:06.135 --> 39:08.971
YOU'VE GOT TO TIGHTEN IT UP.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.556
- IF YOU LOOK BACK,
I THINK YOU'LL SEE,

39:10.639 --> 39:12.433
AT LEAST IN MY OPINION,
A LOT OF TOUGH TATTOOS.

39:12.516 --> 39:15.603
A LOT OF THE HARDER CHOICES
HAVE BEEN DEALT TO ME,

39:15.686 --> 39:17.104
SOMETIMES OUT OF
MALICIOUSNESS.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.355
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN
REALLY SAY TO DEFEND MYSELF

39:18.439 --> 39:20.691
IN ANY KIND OF WAY ABOVE
BEING IN THE BOTTOM.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.943
- JOSHUA.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.112
AT SOME POINT,
YOU ARE GONNA NEED

39:25.196 --> 39:28.616
TO KNOW HOW TO TRANSLATE THINGS
FROM YOUR BRAIN TO THE CANVAS.

39:28.699 --> 39:32.661
YOU ARE TECHNICALLY GOOD,
BUT TODAY YOUR DRAWING SKILLS

39:32.745 --> 39:34.455
HAVE PUT YOU
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

39:34.538 --> 39:35.998
- SO YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE
I DON'T HAVE THEIR STRENGTHS,

39:36.082 --> 39:38.459
I'M A WEAKER ARTIST?

39:38.542 --> 39:39.668
- IN THIS COMPETITION,

39:39.752 --> 39:43.005
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE
TO DO IT ALL.

39:43.089 --> 39:44.423
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.223
JOSHUA, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES

39:52.306 --> 39:53.390
TO BE AN INK MASTER.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.936
- JUST REALIZE HOW [bleep]
CLOSE IT IS TODAY.

39:57.019 --> 39:59.480
IF IT WAS UP TO ME ALONE,
IT WOULD HAVE WENT DIFFERENT.

39:59.563 --> 40:00.773
- AS JUDGES,
WE WERE TORN.

40:00.856 --> 40:01.607
I GOT MY VOTE MY WAY.

40:01.690 --> 40:03.818
OLLIE WANTED TATU BABY
OUT OF HERE,

40:03.901 --> 40:05.861
BUT IT WILL BE OVER
MY DEAD BODY

40:05.945 --> 40:08.072
THAT I CAN KEEP SOMEBODY
THAT CAN'T DRAW.

40:08.155 --> 40:11.492
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:11.575 --> 40:12.952
- THE JUDGES MADE
A BIG MISTAKE.

40:13.035 --> 40:15.079
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE GONNA
SEND SOMEBODY HOME

40:15.162 --> 40:17.665
THAT HASN'T MADE
A TECHNICAL MISTAKE.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.291
NOT [bleep] ONE.

40:19.375 --> 40:20.334
I GOT ROBBED.

40:20.417 --> 40:21.585
THAT WAS [bleep] MY $100,000.

40:25.214 --> 40:27.216
announcer: ON THE NEXT
EPISODE OF <i> INK MASTER.</i>

40:27.299 --> 40:28.717
- WE'RE ONE CHALLENGE AWAY.

40:28.801 --> 40:31.220
- YOU ARE ABOUT TO BE FACED
WITH THE MOST INTENSE

40:31.303 --> 40:33.180
TATTOOING SITUATION
OF THE COMPETITION.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.891
- A WHAT?
- BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.351
- WHAT?

40:37.434 --> 40:39.854
- THE TWIST IS A DEFINITE
HOLY [bleep] TWIST.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.188
- THIS IS THE POINT
IN THE COMPETITION

40:41.272 --> 40:43.315
WHERE I GOT ELIMINATED
LAST SEASON.

40:43.399 --> 40:45.317
- EVERYBODY IN THE FIELD
IS GONNA FINISH OUT STRONG,

40:45.401 --> 40:46.694
EXCEPT TATU BABY.

40:46.777 --> 40:49.989
{\an1}- WHEN I WAS LEARNING TO TATTOO,
EVERY TIME I DID A LINE WRONG,

40:50.072 --> 40:52.825
SOMEBODY YELLED
IN MY [bleep] FACE.

40:52.908 --> 40:53.617
WHO'S YELLING AT YOU?
