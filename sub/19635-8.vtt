<i> Previously on Broadchurch...</i>

00:02.639 --> 00:04.119
Who did this to me?

00:08.360 --> 00:10.480
Bloody hell, Miller - the sock
found on the Axehampton estate

00:10.479 --> 00:12.159
confirmed as a match
for Trish's DNA.

00:12.159 --> 00:14.199
-So it was used as a gag?
-More than that.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.800
There are traces of one of
our men's DNA on the sock.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.800
Who?

00:23.400 --> 00:25.080
(PHONE RINGS)

00:25.079 --> 00:27.439
-MILLER: It's Katie.
-No, no, no. Not a good idea.

00:27.479 --> 00:30.279
-Why would she call
at this time of night?
-Do not answer it.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.680
-Katie?
-God's sake, Miller.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.600
Can you get to Flintcombe
Farm Shop urgently?

00:33.600 --> 00:36.080
-We're heading somewhere else.
-I think we've found the twine

00:36.079 --> 00:38.319
that was used to tie up
Trish Winterman.

00:38.319 --> 00:39.839
-Stop the car.
-No!

00:39.839 --> 00:41.639
Stop the bloody car!

00:41.639 --> 00:43.519
It's just stuff that
got left in the cab.

00:43.519 --> 00:46.759
-Why haven't you given it back?
-I didn't know whose it was.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.000
A woman has been raped
and you've got her keys.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.800
Not just hers - loads of people's.

00:51.800 --> 00:55.400
-Get out!
-You don't tell me what
I can or can't do anymore.

00:57.560 --> 01:01.120
-Evening, Clive.
-What are you doing here?

01:01.119 --> 01:02.959
Clive Lucas, I'm arresting you

01:02.959 --> 01:04.799
in connection with the
rape of Patricia Winterman

01:04.800 --> 01:07.120
committed at Axehampton House
on Saturday, 28 May this year.

01:07.119 --> 01:09.839
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

01:09.839 --> 01:11.279
if you do not mention,
when questioned,

01:11.280 --> 01:13.200
something which you
later rely on in court.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.080
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

01:15.079 --> 01:16.919
You understand?

01:16.920 --> 01:18.480
You'll want these as well.

01:18.479 --> 01:22.039
-LUCAS: I can explain.
-Looks like you'll need to.

01:24.959 --> 01:27.119
-What's going on?
-Go back to bed, Michael.

01:27.119 --> 01:28.999
-Where are you taking him?
-Nothing to worry about.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.440
-Why are they taking him?
-It's gonna be fine.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.480
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

01:34.479 --> 01:37.719
ED: I was doing some work
and I came across this bag.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.040
Did you touch it?

01:40.039 --> 01:42.119
When I found it, yeah.

01:42.119 --> 01:44.239
I thought it was something
a customer maybe dropped.

01:44.239 --> 01:46.359
Makes no sense it was out here.

01:46.360 --> 01:49.040
What about the twine -
did you touch that?

01:50.360 --> 01:52.480
Yeah, I pulled it out to see.

01:52.479 --> 01:54.559
-Why?
-I didn't know what it was, did I?

01:54.560 --> 01:57.640
It wasn't till I saw the
twine that I called you.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.079
And then I called you.

01:59.079 --> 02:00.839
Right, so your prints and your DNA

02:00.839 --> 02:02.839
are all over the bag and the twine.

02:02.839 --> 02:05.079
I guess so.

02:05.079 --> 02:07.519
You do have CCTV here,
though, don't you?

02:07.519 --> 02:09.199
Yeah.

02:09.199 --> 02:11.680
OK. Will you go with
the officer, please?

02:17.319 --> 02:19.319
Do you think he's telling the truth?

02:20.360 --> 02:22.080
Honestly, I don't know anymore.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.200
-(SIGHS)
-(FOOTSTEPS)

02:31.519 --> 02:33.399
You alright?

02:34.519 --> 02:36.279
Yeah. Yeah.

02:37.560 --> 02:39.600
You know, you really
can have Chlo's room.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.640
No, I'm not having her
sleeping on the sofa.

02:42.639 --> 02:44.039
You just got out of hospital.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.359
It's fuss over nothing.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.320
Not really.

02:54.079 --> 02:55.799
Didn't expect to see you awake.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.560
I couldn't sleep. I was
worried about you down here.

03:00.439 --> 03:03.519
Thought I'd pretend I was coming
down for a glass of water.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.760
Always were a terrible liar.

03:06.759 --> 03:08.759
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

03:12.360 --> 03:14.360
If neither of us is sleeping,

03:14.360 --> 03:16.600
should I go and make
us a hot chocolate?

03:17.639 --> 03:19.479
Yeah.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.840
-HARDY: He just found them?
-It's what he said.

03:34.839 --> 03:36.239
And he has a convenient excuse

03:36.239 --> 03:37.799
for his DNA being
all over the evidence.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.880
The thing is we searched
his house, all around there,

03:39.879 --> 03:43.159
including that shed, 40 hours
ago, and we didn't spot that.

03:43.159 --> 03:45.319
And that whole area's
covered by CCTV.

03:45.319 --> 03:47.159
He knows that.
So why would he lie?

03:47.159 --> 03:50.639
Vice is tightening, Miller.
They're starting to squeak.

03:50.639 --> 03:53.679
So Jim Atwood, Clive Lucas
or Ed Burnett - take your pick.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.320
Who do we talk to first?

03:55.319 --> 04:00.159
For the tape, I am showing
Mr Lucas Exhibit AH141.

04:00.159 --> 04:02.959
Why have you got a set
of Trish Winterman's house keys?

04:03.839 --> 04:05.599
She left them in the taxi.

04:07.759 --> 04:10.199
But you didn't think
to give them back to her.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.280
I didn't get round to it.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.520
HARDY: Like you didn't
get round to giving back

04:14.519 --> 04:17.199
all the others you had
locked in your garage drawer.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.559
I didn't know where they lived.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.079
You drove most of them home.

04:22.079 --> 04:24.159
Your company keeps  records of bookings.

04:24.159 --> 04:26.599
Some of them, presumably,
were regular customers.

04:28.879 --> 04:32.759
You see, it looks to me
like a trophy drawer.

04:34.639 --> 04:36.199
Or a collection.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.320
-What did you do with them?
-Nothing.

04:43.319 --> 04:47.199
I...I'm just...cleaning up.

04:47.239 --> 04:49.559
It's not my fault
if people are careless.

04:52.239 --> 04:55.679
Did none of them ever ask
if you'd found their keys?

05:00.920 --> 05:03.440
What was it?
Was it the power?

05:03.439 --> 05:05.639
Knowing you have them...

05:07.519 --> 05:09.199
..knowing you could
use them if you wanted.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.800
Have you ever used any of them?

05:10.800 --> 05:14.160
Let yourself into someone's house?

05:14.159 --> 05:16.279
I'm not that sort of man.

05:16.280 --> 05:19.680
Oh, well...I think you are.

05:19.680 --> 05:23.320
I think your relationship
to real life is a bit troubling.

05:23.319 --> 05:26.439
Where do you get off with
all this having a go at me?

05:26.479 --> 05:29.599
You asked Jim Atwood why he was
arguing with Trish at the party?

05:29.600 --> 05:31.880
Hey?

05:31.879 --> 05:34.759
Have you?

05:34.759 --> 05:37.439
No, we weren't aware of that.
What time was that?

05:37.439 --> 05:39.879
10-ish, I suppose.

05:39.879 --> 05:41.559
She told him to stay away from her.

05:41.560 --> 05:42.800
(FLICKS THROUGH PAPERS)

05:42.800 --> 05:44.200
I don't know why you keep coming

05:44.200 --> 05:45.600
for me when he's out there.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.080
Mmm. You weren't there at that time.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.600
According to the
statement you gave us,

05:52.600 --> 05:55.480
you were on the road to
Lyme with a passenger.

05:58.239 --> 05:59.679
Right.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.720
I might have got confused.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.760
Well, let's clear up that confusion.

06:03.759 --> 06:05.879
What was it?

06:05.879 --> 06:07.359
At the party looking at Jim and Trish

06:07.360 --> 06:09.320
or on the road to Lyme
with a passenger?

06:13.680 --> 06:15.200
Party.

06:16.079 --> 06:18.559
So your previous alibi was false.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.240
You lied to us.

06:20.239 --> 06:22.199
-Not deliberately.
-Oh, it was an accidental lie?

06:22.200 --> 06:24.240
I...I just got my timings muddled.

06:24.239 --> 06:26.799
-Were you alone when you
saw Trish and Jim arguing?
-Yeah.

06:26.839 --> 06:29.559
-Were you on your own for
the rest of the evening?
-Yeah.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.640
So you have no alibi

06:31.639 --> 06:35.199
that can confirm where you were
when the rape was taking place?

06:36.159 --> 06:39.239
No, right...
That's not what I said.

06:39.239 --> 06:43.279
For the tape, I am now
showing Mr Lucas AH127.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.280
Have you ever worn a sock like that?

06:45.280 --> 06:48.480
Those are the socks we
wear to play football,

06:48.479 --> 06:50.159
so, yeah.

06:50.159 --> 06:53.159
That was recovered from the
grounds of Axehampton House.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.200
We found traces of
Trish Winterman's saliva on it,

06:56.200 --> 06:59.560
so we believe that was used
to gag her while she was raped.

06:59.560 --> 07:03.560
And when we tested it,
it came back as a match

07:03.560 --> 07:05.200
with your DNA.

07:07.479 --> 07:09.359
It...it's not mine!

07:09.360 --> 07:11.200
MILLER: We know that you and Trish

07:11.200 --> 07:13.240
previously went for a drink
and she knocked you back.

07:13.239 --> 07:14.879
You have a set of her house keys.

07:14.879 --> 07:17.359
You don't now have an alibi
for the time of the attack

07:17.360 --> 07:19.320
and your DNA is on that sock.

07:19.319 --> 07:21.799
So we need your explanation
as to how this all makes sense

07:21.800 --> 07:23.760
if you didn't rape Trish Winterman.

07:23.759 --> 07:26.159
(STAMMERS) I can't.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.599
Sorry.

07:29.639 --> 07:31.359
I can't explain that.

07:32.439 --> 07:34.879
I still enjoy those moments
when some cocky bastard

07:34.879 --> 07:36.559
trashes their own alibi
without realising it.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.240
We got the CCTV from the farm shop yet?

07:39.239 --> 07:42.199
20 minutes, Nish said.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.080
Right, come on, let's get
in and rattle his cage.

07:45.079 --> 07:46.999
You searched the whole
place two days ago.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.680
That bag wasn't there.

07:48.680 --> 07:51.920
You want us to believe
you see a suspicious bag

07:51.920 --> 07:53.720
inside one of your sheds,

07:53.759 --> 07:56.479
pick it up, leaving
your fingerprints and DNA,

07:56.479 --> 07:57.959
scratch around inside.

07:57.959 --> 08:01.079
"Oh, some blood-stained twine.
I'll fiddle with that too."

08:01.079 --> 08:02.799
I didn't realise
it was a suspicious bag

08:02.800 --> 08:04.320
until I looked inside.

08:04.319 --> 08:06.799
If I did this,
why would I call it in?

08:06.800 --> 08:09.840
It doesn't make any sense.
How stupid would I have to be?

08:09.839 --> 08:11.959
Not stupid, maybe. Desperate.

08:12.839 --> 08:15.719
Check the CCTV, please.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.720
I want to help.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.400
I'm trying to help.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.160
If you waste time on me,

08:22.159 --> 08:23.759
you won't catch the bloke who did it.

08:23.759 --> 08:27.559
I have sat across from you
during all these interviews.

08:27.560 --> 08:30.960
I've listened to every word,
watched your reactions,

08:30.959 --> 08:32.719
I've studied your body language.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.120
And I think there is still something

08:36.119 --> 08:37.599
that you are not telling us.

08:39.239 --> 08:42.399
I don't think you've been
100% honest with us

08:42.400 --> 08:45.480
and I cannot for the life of me
understand why that is.

08:45.479 --> 08:49.879
If you know anything that will
help us rule you out, tell us.

08:49.879 --> 08:52.999
Anything else that happened
that night doesn't matter.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.040
It does matter.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.519
It matters to me.

09:01.519 --> 09:03.599
Why?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.640
Because I heard it.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.480
You heard what, Ed?

09:16.959 --> 09:19.039
I heard her being raped.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.080
I didn't know that's what it was.

09:24.079 --> 09:25.879
I was at the edge of the woods.

09:25.879 --> 09:27.719
This was after I fell.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.520
I heard some sounds coming
from around the waterfall.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.840
I thought it was just drunk sex.

09:37.839 --> 09:41.159
Didn't realise what it was until later,

09:41.159 --> 09:43.079
till I found out what really happened.

09:43.079 --> 09:45.919
I could have stopped it.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.200
I could have helped her.

09:51.479 --> 09:54.519
You wanna know why I've slept
near her place ever since?

09:57.720 --> 10:00.320
Because I failed her.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.720
(SIGHS) Nights like this,
I wish I still smoked.

10:06.759 --> 10:09.519
-I KNEW you used to smoke!
-What's your instinct?

10:09.519 --> 10:11.159
You think that's finally
the truth from him?

10:11.159 --> 10:12.919
Well, it could be, or it could be

10:12.920 --> 10:14.800
a very clever
get-out-of-jail-free card.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.440
"I wasn't there, but I was nearby."

10:16.439 --> 10:18.799
If that's what he's been
carrying, that explains a lot.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.440
That's a thing to live with.

10:20.439 --> 10:22.639
Well, it's nothing compared
to what Trish is dealing with.

10:22.639 --> 10:24.239
-(PHONE BUZZES)
-No.

10:25.079 --> 10:27.239
Oh, we've got the shop CCTV.

10:27.239 --> 10:29.399
This footage is timecoded,

10:29.400 --> 10:31.280
and when this happened,
Ed was in custody.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.960
So, what, Ed's in the clear?

10:32.959 --> 10:35.319
What do you reckon - Lucas or Jim?

10:35.319 --> 10:37.119
It's the right sort of build.

10:37.119 --> 10:39.119
So he ran in here. Building's here.

10:39.119 --> 10:42.079
And then he runs out here,
towards this field.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.880
Ah!

10:45.879 --> 10:48.119
HARDY: What are you doing?

10:50.479 --> 10:53.239
Yes, there - the figure on the CCTV

10:53.239 --> 10:55.839
runs into a field on the
edge of Flintcombe Farm

10:55.839 --> 10:58.399
with a public footpath through it.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.840
You go down that footpath
and it leads to this road here,

11:00.839 --> 11:02.199
which means...

11:09.720 --> 11:12.520
-Got it!
-Go on.

11:12.519 --> 11:15.319
So this field links to that road,

11:15.319 --> 11:18.719
which has a parking lay-by and a
newly installed traffic camera.

11:18.720 --> 11:22.440
(TYPES)

11:22.439 --> 11:26.399
There he is. There's his car
and there's his registration.

11:26.439 --> 11:29.479
Very good, Miller!
You should do this for a living.

11:29.479 --> 11:31.759
And that licence plate belongs to...

11:39.079 --> 11:41.119
Swaggery little shit.

11:45.959 --> 11:48.599
MARK: Do you remember when we
came and looked at this house?

11:50.159 --> 11:52.519
You walked straight into that kitchen,

11:52.519 --> 11:54.359
looked out the window and you said,

11:54.400 --> 11:56.240
"Imagine being able to
live somewhere like this.

11:56.239 --> 11:58.159
"Imagine having that
view every morning."

11:58.159 --> 12:00.999
And I knew then that was...

12:02.159 --> 12:04.079
That was it. Decision made.

12:04.079 --> 12:06.239
I was right, though, wasn't I?

12:06.239 --> 12:08.319
You were always right.

12:08.319 --> 12:10.279
About pretty much everything.

12:10.280 --> 12:13.360
Not everything, but pretty much.

12:14.239 --> 12:16.359
I'm just catching up half the time.

12:16.360 --> 12:20.000
A few months later,
I'm like, "Oh, yeah. Yeah.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.320
"What Beth said was right."

12:25.800 --> 12:28.800
That's what it's like being me.

12:28.800 --> 12:32.080
"A month late and 10 quid
short," my mum would have said.

12:32.079 --> 12:34.239
You're not that bad.

12:34.239 --> 12:36.679
Oh. Thanks very much.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.760
Make a good hot chocolate.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.560
Yeah, my kitchen skills are alright.

12:49.079 --> 12:51.039
Did you not want to live?

12:56.879 --> 12:58.559
No.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.760
What about us?

13:04.720 --> 13:07.760
Me and...Chlo and Lizzie?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.080
I don't feel part of you anymore.

13:16.479 --> 13:18.479
I don't live here.

13:18.479 --> 13:20.119
We're not together.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.560
We're not gonna be, are we?

13:27.639 --> 13:30.199
Come on, least you can do
is be honest with me.

13:33.959 --> 13:35.479
No.

13:38.439 --> 13:41.519
I don't think we can be together.

13:41.519 --> 13:43.559
Not right now.

13:44.839 --> 13:46.359
Yeah.

13:48.839 --> 13:50.359
Yeah.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.320
I really love you, Mark.

14:02.439 --> 14:04.399
I always have.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.480
So much.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.920
I remember when I used
to see you and I...

14:09.920 --> 14:13.480
..I felt like my body was bursting.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.680
Not...not now?

14:18.720 --> 14:20.440
No.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.720
We just...

14:26.959 --> 14:28.999
We went different ways.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.320
I don't even know when.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.000
Because of Dan?

14:35.920 --> 14:38.800
No. Before. You know that.

14:42.319 --> 14:44.399
You can still see Lizzie.

14:45.639 --> 14:48.839
You know, we can be friends.

14:48.839 --> 14:50.399
You can come to the house.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.080
No, no.

14:52.079 --> 14:55.119
I...I have to go.

14:55.119 --> 14:59.679
I have to...sort myself out for a bit.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.400
For a while.

15:03.560 --> 15:06.360
It's too difficult
being near, you know?

15:06.360 --> 15:08.640
And I think that's what's done me in.

15:17.319 --> 15:20.199
Seeing you and the girls and...

15:22.439 --> 15:24.799
..this house, all of the memories...

15:24.800 --> 15:29.600
..you know, it's...it's what
I struggle with, I think.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.200
I'll be alright, though.
I'll be alright.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.480
I just...just need to
put myself back together.

15:40.079 --> 15:43.119
Away from here, you know?
Anywhere.

15:49.759 --> 15:51.599
So this is how it happens, then?

15:57.839 --> 15:59.799
I love you.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.560
Yeah, I love you too.

16:18.239 --> 16:20.399
MILLER: We've got
Leo Humphries on camera

16:20.400 --> 16:23.240
disposing of a bag
containing blood-stained twine

16:23.239 --> 16:26.999
which Forensics have confirmed
is a match with the fibres

16:27.000 --> 16:28.680
taken from Trish Winterman's wrists.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.680
But we also have Lucas in custody,

16:30.680 --> 16:32.880
no alibi, and his DNA on the gag.

16:32.879 --> 16:35.239
Maybe it was both of them together.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.200
So Leo disposing of the bag for Lucas

16:38.200 --> 16:40.080
to throw suspicion onto Ed?

16:40.079 --> 16:42.759
Do they even know each other?
Is there a connection?

16:43.959 --> 16:46.599
Yeah. Football, uh... football sock.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.760
Leo and Lucas both brought
the goals to the match

16:48.759 --> 16:50.159
with that same blue twine.

16:50.159 --> 16:52.679
Someone said Leo trains the team

16:52.680 --> 16:55.440
and Lucas is on that team,
so, yeah, there's a connection.

16:55.439 --> 16:57.999
(DOORBELL RINGS)

16:58.000 --> 17:00.440
Hi, Danielle. Is Leo here?

17:00.439 --> 17:02.839
-No, he's not, sorry.
-We went to his house.

17:02.839 --> 17:04.638
-His dad said he was here.
-(PHONE RINGS)

17:04.638 --> 17:06.759
And if he's not here,
why is his phone ringing?

17:07.959 --> 17:09.719
Come on out, Leo.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.440
We have arrested Leo Humphries

17:16.439 --> 17:19.519
and we're currently
searching his work and home.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.480
We know you know each other.

17:22.479 --> 17:24.279
We've recovered a key piece of evidence

17:24.280 --> 17:26.359
that Leo tried to dump late last night.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.760
Now, I'm telling you this

17:29.759 --> 17:32.439
because my sense of Leo Humphries

17:32.439 --> 17:34.399
is that he will try and stitch you up.

17:35.839 --> 17:37.719
I might be wrong, and you probably

17:37.720 --> 17:39.160
know him better than I do.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.759
But as soon as we're done here,

17:40.759 --> 17:42.799
we're gonna go into that
room across the corridor

17:42.800 --> 17:44.280
and talk to him.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.720
And eventually,
he will tell us everything.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.120
So I'd suggest you should
get in there first

17:54.119 --> 17:55.599
and tell us the truth.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.400
What happened at Axehampton?

18:04.639 --> 18:07.279
I've told you what happened.

18:07.280 --> 18:10.160
We don't believe you. Try again.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.920
Your account of the night
doesn't make any sense, Lucas.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.000
Your DNA is on the gag.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.880
Leo Humphries is
about to drop you in it.

18:20.879 --> 18:22.479
Tell us why you raped
Trish Winterman.

18:22.479 --> 18:24.599
I didn't rape her!
I couldn't do that!

18:24.600 --> 18:26.920
Did you hold a torch
or a phone to shine a light?

18:26.959 --> 18:30.199
-That what he asked you to do?
-I don't know anything about it.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.040
Lucas, you're gonna have to stop lying,

18:32.039 --> 18:33.679
'cause you are not very good at it.

18:35.439 --> 18:37.439
(SIGHS)

18:37.439 --> 18:39.759
And look at you - you're exhausted.

18:48.079 --> 18:50.239
I wanna talk to my solicitor.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.520
Yep. You do that.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.000
We need to find a piece of evidence

19:01.000 --> 19:02.520
that connects Lucas and
Leo and places them

19:02.519 --> 19:04.359
together at Axehampton
at the time of the attack.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.240
We need both their phones
analysed, for a start.

19:06.239 --> 19:08.879
They're both lying.
They must have been together.

19:08.879 --> 19:10.559
Where did they meet, what did they do?

19:10.560 --> 19:12.040
We must have something, Miller.

19:24.639 --> 19:26.159
Timelines of movement.

19:30.680 --> 19:34.040
Statements and alibis.

19:36.400 --> 19:40.360
(SIGHS) Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

19:45.519 --> 19:47.199
Oh, I can't have that.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.440
Scene-of-crime forensic reports.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.880
HARDY: So that's the route
Lucas lied about driving

19:57.879 --> 19:59.279
the night of the attack.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.040
Wait, there's something...

20:01.039 --> 20:03.959
Yeah, Miller, look. See?
We did that journey tonight.

20:03.959 --> 20:06.799
He said he picked up a passenger
on the road and drove to Lyme.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.360
We went to Lyme tonight,
to Leo's girlfriend's house.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.760
MILLER: Right.

20:10.759 --> 20:12.959
So...what does that mean?

20:12.959 --> 20:15.239
Uh...

20:15.239 --> 20:18.119
..we're underestimating Lucas.

20:18.119 --> 20:21.879
We've always thought
he was rubbish at lying,

20:21.879 --> 20:24.439
but maybe he's not a bad liar -
maybe he's a good liar,

20:24.439 --> 20:26.439
'cause the best liars always
stick close to the truth.

20:26.439 --> 20:28.119
So he did drive to Lyme that night,

20:28.119 --> 20:29.959
only later than he told us,

20:29.959 --> 20:31.559
and the person he took
was Leo Humphries.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.880
Exactly! Leo's phone - where's
the analysis on Leo's phone?

20:33.879 --> 20:35.519
I saw it come through earlier.

20:35.519 --> 20:39.079
There was a call
to Leo's mobile tonight

20:39.079 --> 20:41.119
around the time you brought Lucas in.

20:41.159 --> 20:43.319
I'll see if we can match it.

20:45.159 --> 20:47.959
Match for the phone number.
We know who called Leo tonight.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.600
Who?

20:53.839 --> 20:55.959
We know what you're doing, Lucas.

20:55.959 --> 20:57.879
What do you mean?

20:57.879 --> 21:00.639
One last opportunity to tell us
what happened that night.

21:00.680 --> 21:03.640
I already have.

21:03.639 --> 21:07.799
For the tape, I am showing
Mr Lucas exhibit number EM153.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.480
It's a telephone number.

21:09.479 --> 21:11.759
Do you know whose phone
number that is, Lucas?

21:12.879 --> 21:14.839
Sorry - for the tape, please.

21:14.839 --> 21:16.959
-No, I don't.
-You do know!

21:16.959 --> 21:19.399
You know that number and you
know what happened that night.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.320
And you're still refusing to tell us,

21:21.319 --> 21:23.479
which means you're perverting
the course of justice.

21:23.479 --> 21:25.319
Please stop asking me!

21:25.319 --> 21:27.479
We tracked that phone the night
Trish Winterman was raped

21:27.479 --> 21:31.399
and it was in Axehampton,
just like Leo Humphries's phone.

21:33.439 --> 21:35.279
As was your phone.

21:37.039 --> 21:39.079
And then later that
night, around 1am,

21:39.079 --> 21:41.119
all three phones were
triangulated together

21:41.119 --> 21:43.119
in the same place - these three phones,

21:43.119 --> 21:45.239
these three people, all together.

21:46.920 --> 21:49.360
-Don't make me do this.
-HARDY: Make you?!

21:49.360 --> 21:53.520
You have a moral duty and a
legal duty to tell us the truth!

21:55.720 --> 21:58.360
A woman was raped that night.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.320
Two others that we know
of were raped before.

22:01.319 --> 22:03.239
And you won't tell us what you know?!

22:06.800 --> 22:08.520
Look, you have no choice, Lucas.

22:09.519 --> 22:12.479
It'll be worse for you
if you keep quiet.

22:14.239 --> 22:16.519
I only gave him a lift home.

22:16.519 --> 22:19.039

41:43.600 --> 41:46.760
-I'm really proud of you, Dad.
-Oh, good.

41:46.759 --> 41:49.239
Really so proud.

41:55.959 --> 41:57.199
Hi, Dad.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.480
Listen, say if it's
inappropriate, but...

42:00.479 --> 42:03.359
..what if I brought
round a takeaway later?

42:03.360 --> 42:06.200
I was thinking maybe a Chinese?

42:06.200 --> 42:08.280
You know that set menu
we all used to have?

42:09.159 --> 42:10.679
Is that a rubbish idea?

42:11.959 --> 42:14.719
No. No, that could work.

42:16.519 --> 42:18.519
Great.

42:49.360 --> 42:52.320
(ALL CHATTER)

42:53.519 --> 42:57.599
You got all that?
Don't eat it all in one go!

43:43.079 --> 43:45.159
MILLER: I keep thinking
about Michael Lucas

43:45.159 --> 43:47.199
and what Leo brought him to.

43:47.200 --> 43:50.760
HARDY: He called at my house.

43:50.759 --> 43:54.039
He was one of the boys
that had photos of Daisy.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.320
That porn that Leo gave him,

43:58.319 --> 44:00.039
that's what he gave to Tom,

44:00.039 --> 44:01.559
imitating Leo.

44:02.800 --> 44:04.600
Well, not anymore.

44:08.439 --> 44:11.519
We did our job, Miller.
We got the people responsible.

44:11.519 --> 44:13.159
It's all we can do.

44:17.200 --> 44:19.360
I could do with a drink.
Do you want one?

44:19.360 --> 44:22.120
We could go to the pub!
We've never been to the pub.

44:24.600 --> 44:26.240
No.

44:26.239 --> 44:27.999
Ah.

44:33.720 --> 44:35.600
I should get back to Daisy.

44:35.600 --> 44:37.760
I should get back to my boys.

44:38.759 --> 44:41.159
So you and Daisy, then -

44:41.159 --> 44:43.319
you're gonna stay, properly, now?

44:43.319 --> 44:45.239
You don't hate it that much?

44:47.280 --> 44:49.200
I'll see you in the morning, Miller.

44:49.200 --> 44:52.440
(CHUCKLES) Fine. See you tomorrow.
