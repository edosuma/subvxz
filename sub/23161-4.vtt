WEBVTT

00:00.117 --> 00:03.143
We got 48 hours,
then they're gonna kill
little Garwood.

00:05.389 --> 00:07.880
What are you doing?
You should give
yourself up.

00:07.958 --> 00:10.825
Not until I have
my grandson back.

00:10.928 --> 00:13.920
Higgins, you're harboring
and abetting an escaped
bank robber. Why?

00:13.998 --> 00:16.398
I did not bust
Garwood out of jail.

00:16.467 --> 00:18.901
You're gonna have to help me
if you want me to find
your son.

00:18.969 --> 00:20.937
Get out of here
before I call the police.

00:23.140 --> 00:25.631
And you wonder
why people shoot at you.

01:34.645 --> 01:39.082
<i>And now</i>
<i>for the news of the week</i>
<i>for July 23rd, 1944.</i>

01:39.150 --> 01:42.017
<i>Garwood Huddle,</i>
<i>the notorious unarmed bandit,</i>

01:42.086 --> 01:44.520
<i>has now spread his infamy</i>
<i>over two countries</i>

01:44.588 --> 01:47.421
<i>by robbing</i>
<i>the Banco Internacional</i>
<i>in Mexico City</i>

01:47.491 --> 01:50.051
<i>of over $90,000.</i>

01:50.127 --> 01:52.357
<i>Huddle is now believed</i>
<i>to be back in the Midwest,</i>

01:52.430 --> 01:55.922
<i>and the public is warned</i>
<i>that despite</i>
<i>their no-guns reputation,</i>

01:56.000 --> 01:57.865
<i>these men are</i>
<i>desperate criminals</i>

01:57.935 --> 01:59.994
<i>and should be considered</i>
<i>extremely dangerous.</i>

02:00.071 --> 02:01.163
Higgins.

02:01.272 --> 02:04.400
<i>Huddle and gang members</i>
<i>Arnold Slick Simms</i>
<i>and Mortie Anderson</i>

02:04.475 --> 02:06.534
<i>were able to convince</i>
<i>bank employees</i>

02:06.610 --> 02:08.976
<i>that the toy guns</i>
<i>they carried were real,</i>

02:09.045 --> 02:11.071
<i>the same incredible</i>
<i>method of operation</i>

02:11.148 --> 02:14.743
<i>that has led</i>
<i>the Huddle gang through</i>
<i>47 successful robberies</i>

02:14.819 --> 02:16.218
<i>in the United States.</i>

02:16.287 --> 02:19.188
<i>This was the last time anyone</i>
<i>had seen Garwood Huddle</i>

02:19.256 --> 02:22.851
<i>just prior to his escape</i>
<i>last year from the police</i>
<i>station at Joliet, Illinois...</i>

02:22.927 --> 02:24.121
Higgins, why are we
watching this?

02:24.195 --> 02:25.958
<i>Yes, he had tricked</i>
<i>the guard into thinking</i>

02:26.030 --> 02:28.430
<i>the pistol he had</i>
<i>with him was real.</i>

02:28.499 --> 02:30.990
That's very interesting,
Higgins, but I have got to go.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.433
No, please wait.

02:32.603 --> 02:35.265
Last evening's news.
I recorded it
on the same tape.

02:35.339 --> 02:37.034
I saw last evening's news.

02:37.108 --> 02:39.702
Please watch
just for another moment.

02:40.845 --> 02:42.710
<i>Turning to</i>
<i>the local headlines,</i>

02:42.780 --> 02:46.079
<i>Garwood Huddle, the infamous</i>
<i>unarmed bandit of the '40s,</i>

02:46.150 --> 02:49.779
<i>has escaped from</i>
<i>Oahu Minimum Security Prison</i>
<i>this evening.</i>

02:49.854 --> 02:51.549
Higgins, why are we
watching this?

02:51.622 --> 02:53.681
Why? I have got
a game to play.

02:53.757 --> 02:54.815
I'll explain in a moment.

02:54.892 --> 02:57.622
<i>...was due for parole hearings</i>
<i>in just three months.</i>

02:58.162 --> 03:01.063
<i>The infamous Huddle</i>
<i>was serving</i>
<i>a 10-year sentence</i>

03:01.132 --> 03:03.692
<i>for the robbery</i>
<i>of Island Mutual Savings</i>

03:03.767 --> 03:05.860
<i>in July of 1979.</i>

03:06.337 --> 03:10.273
<i>Police ask that anyone</i>
<i>with knowledge of Garwood</i>
<i>Huddle's whereabouts...</i>

03:11.208 --> 03:13.506
Are we through?
Okay, so what?

03:13.577 --> 03:17.172
So some relic
from a Jimmy Cagney movie
escapes from the big house.

03:17.248 --> 03:18.476
Big deal.
Magnum...

03:18.549 --> 03:20.244
And you want me
to track him down

03:20.317 --> 03:23.115
so that we can
prevent him from robbing
all the drugstores in Oahu

03:23.187 --> 03:25.849
of their denture cream
before public panic sets in.

03:25.923 --> 03:27.220
Magnum...
Well, Higgins,
forget about it.

03:27.291 --> 03:30.454
I have got a ballgame.
A playoff game.

03:30.528 --> 03:33.759
And whatever game it is
you wanna play
with Garnett Huddle,

03:33.831 --> 03:36.265
you can do it tonight
after the game.
Magnum...

03:36.333 --> 03:38.961
Sorry, friend,
I don't have
that kind of time.

03:39.170 --> 03:42.367
Now, why don't you just
sit down, calm yourself.
Let's palaver a little.

03:42.940 --> 03:44.908
I did try
to tell you, Magnum.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.569
Name's Garwood, not Garnett.

03:47.945 --> 03:50.038
Don't need no denture cream.
Still got my own.

03:51.015 --> 03:52.915
Great. What's going on here?

03:52.983 --> 03:55.747
If you had allowed me
to explain the situation
as I intended,

03:55.819 --> 03:58.583
without your typically
sophomoric display
of alleged wit,

03:58.656 --> 04:00.647
you wouldn't be asking
that question.

04:01.058 --> 04:03.959
Suffice it to say,
we need your help.

04:04.028 --> 04:07.555
"We"? "We"?
As in you and Garwood?

04:07.631 --> 04:09.622
Correct.
Higgins, you're
harboring and abetting

04:09.700 --> 04:11.167
an escaped bank robber.
Why?

04:11.235 --> 04:13.863
Well, you see, son, <i>el</i> Higgo
and me go back quite a way.

04:13.971 --> 04:15.131
All the way back to Mexico.

04:15.206 --> 04:16.764
He robbed that bank with you?

04:16.839 --> 04:19.570
Oh, not exactly.
<i>El</i> Higgo set it up
for me, though.

04:19.709 --> 04:20.971
Would you like to have
some of this?

04:21.077 --> 04:22.067
No.

04:22.813 --> 04:25.043
This had better be good,
<i>el</i> Higgo.

04:25.282 --> 04:26.306
Quite.

04:27.051 --> 04:29.178
The incident Garwood
is referring to

04:29.420 --> 04:32.116
took place during
my years with Ml6.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.218
1944, to be exact.

04:34.692 --> 04:37.752
The Third Reich had
managed to place some
top-secret documents

04:37.828 --> 04:39.728
in a Mexican bank
for safekeeping,

04:39.797 --> 04:43.733
documents vital to
the success of some
very crucial Ml6 activities.

04:43.801 --> 04:45.268
Well, sending our own agents
in to get them

04:45.369 --> 04:47.269
was diplomatically
risky business at best and...

04:47.338 --> 04:48.896
Higgins, get to the point.

04:48.973 --> 04:51.908
He's right, boy.
You always could talk
the ears off a jackrabbit.

04:51.976 --> 04:53.204
Now, let's get with it.

04:53.277 --> 04:55.939
Quite. As I was saying,

04:56.247 --> 04:59.307
my assignment was to hire
a notorious criminal,

04:59.750 --> 05:02.583
a man who would simply
appear to be robbing
just another bank.

05:02.686 --> 05:04.153
Garwood.
The boy's quick.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.356
His mission, of course,
was to bring out
the Nazi documents.

05:07.925 --> 05:11.554
Garwood later returned all
of the money and refused
to accept any remuneration.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.362
His contribution
to the war effort.

05:13.530 --> 05:17.159
So 40 years later you say
thank you by busting
him out of jail?

05:17.234 --> 05:19.862
I did not bust
Garwood out of jail.

05:20.204 --> 05:23.173
He managed that feat,
as he has done so many times
in the past,

05:23.240 --> 05:24.366
all by himself.

05:24.441 --> 05:27.274
Then why?
Why do you need my help?

05:29.246 --> 05:32.647
<i>And in a related story,</i>
<i>Garwood Huddle the Third,</i>

05:32.716 --> 05:35.378
<i>the 2-year-old grandson</i>
<i>of the famous bank robber,</i>

05:35.452 --> 05:39.149
<i>was kidnapped</i>
<i>from his Kaimuki home</i>
<i>yesterday morning.</i>

05:39.323 --> 05:41.291
<i>The police have had</i>
<i>no leads as yet,</i>

05:41.358 --> 05:43.622
<i>and there has been</i>
<i>no ransom note.</i>

05:44.595 --> 05:48.463
<i>This tape, taken earlier</i>
<i>today, shows the mother,</i>
<i>Frannie Huddle,</i>

05:48.599 --> 05:51.796
<i>being comforted</i>
<i>by her fianc√©,</i>
<i>Walter Brewster.</i>

05:52.202 --> 05:54.830
<i>Both refused comment.</i>
<i>Turning to the weather...</i>

05:58.375 --> 06:01.003
So, could you give us a hand?

06:03.947 --> 06:05.915
Well, how?
I mean, you heard it.

06:05.983 --> 06:08.178
The police have no leads,
no ransom note.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.443
That's because I've got
the ransom note.

06:11.088 --> 06:12.680
I got all the leads.

06:16.060 --> 06:18.722
We got 48 hours,
then they're gonna kill
little Garwood.

06:21.832 --> 06:24.528
I'd certainly be much obliged
if you could help us.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.877
<i>Funny thing</i>
<i>about truth and illusion.</i>

06:35.946 --> 06:40.076
<i>If you hear a story enough</i>
<i>times, you begin to believe</i>
<i>it's true.</i>

06:40.284 --> 06:42.980
<i>Garwood Huddle was</i>
<i>living proof of that.</i>

06:43.087 --> 06:46.079
<i>He actually saw himself</i>
<i>as a modern-day Robin Hood,</i>

06:46.156 --> 06:49.683
<i>a good guy who'd stashed away</i>
<i>a legacy for his grandson.</i>

06:50.260 --> 06:54.026
<i>He hadn't counted on</i>
<i>someone trying to</i>
<i>take that legacy away.</i>

06:54.098 --> 06:56.828
<i>Whoever had kidnapped</i>
<i>the little boy was willing</i>
<i>to give him back,</i>

06:57.000 --> 07:00.299
<i>just as soon as we came up</i>
<i>with the money</i>
<i>Garwood had buried.</i>

07:00.371 --> 07:02.965
<i>All we had to do</i>
<i>was go to a vacant lot</i>
<i>where he'd buried it</i>

07:03.040 --> 07:05.008
<i>and spend a couple of hours</i>
<i>digging it up.</i>

07:05.275 --> 07:06.902
<i>Sure, it was breaking</i>
<i>a few laws,</i>

07:06.977 --> 07:08.535
<i>but when it comes to</i>
<i>a 2-year-old kid</i>

07:08.612 --> 07:10.512
<i>who hasn't</i>
<i>yet had a chance</i>
<i>to swing a bat,</i>

07:11.081 --> 07:12.548
<i>what would you do?</i>

07:12.616 --> 07:14.709
Slow down.
It's right over there
on the right.

07:15.986 --> 07:18.511
I don't see
any vacant lot.
All I see is a...

07:20.858 --> 07:22.849
A massage parlor?

07:22.926 --> 07:25.986
Yeah, I was kind of surprised
to see it myself
when I was here last night.

07:26.330 --> 07:27.695
You were here
last night?

07:27.765 --> 07:29.528
Sure. Scouting the place.

07:29.633 --> 07:33.330
The money is buried under
the floor of the last room
to the right.

07:33.437 --> 07:35.462
Well, that's great.
How are we gonna get at it?

07:35.539 --> 07:37.439
There's laws against breaking
and entering, you know.

07:37.508 --> 07:39.237
Just ask for Mavis.

07:39.910 --> 07:43.573
You're sure all you want
is a massage?

07:43.647 --> 07:44.705
Yep.

07:44.848 --> 07:46.315
A real massage?

07:46.383 --> 07:48.374
Uh-huh. Just a massage.

07:49.787 --> 07:52.950
Well, okay.
It's your nickel.

08:04.334 --> 08:05.460
What are you doing?

08:05.536 --> 08:07.163
Air. I like air.

08:07.671 --> 08:09.935
Hey, what's going on here?

08:11.208 --> 08:12.470
That'll be extra, guys.

08:12.543 --> 08:15.876
Don't you worry, little honey.
We're not gonna harm you.

08:15.946 --> 08:17.709
That's what they all say.

08:19.316 --> 08:21.147
Well, we gotta
get started now
before our time's up.

08:21.218 --> 08:24.517
Just about there.
Just about there.
Yep. Right there.

08:41.705 --> 08:43.400
You sure
this is the right spot?

08:43.474 --> 08:45.999
You don't forget 200,000
big ones, buddy.

08:46.076 --> 08:47.907
Which bank was that?

08:48.045 --> 08:50.377
Island Mutual.
Serves them right.

08:50.547 --> 08:53.175
They were foreclosing
on a bunch of banana farmers.

08:53.250 --> 08:56.276
Just small farms up there
on the north coast, you know.

08:56.353 --> 08:59.982
And that original haul, son,
that was close
to half-a-million dollars.

09:00.224 --> 09:03.091
I just spread a little
of that money around
to the farmers.

09:03.193 --> 09:05.320
Helped them hang
onto their property
a little longer.

09:05.929 --> 09:07.794
Then I kept the gravy.

09:07.931 --> 09:10.456
You know,
bank-robbing's illegal, Gar...

09:12.536 --> 09:15.130
I mean, lots of other
people had their money
in there, too.

09:15.205 --> 09:16.570
Insured.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.198
That's not the point.

09:18.675 --> 09:21.576
Besides, aren't you
getting a little old
to be playing Robin Hood?

09:21.678 --> 09:23.669
Been doing it
all my life.

09:23.747 --> 09:26.716
Ever since that guy
came from a bank
in Odessa, Texas,

09:26.817 --> 09:29.149
says to my daddy,
"Don't you worry, Mr. Huddle.

09:29.219 --> 09:33.053
"Don't you worry
about them late payments.
Why, the bank understands."

09:33.257 --> 09:35.418
And then, a week later,

09:35.492 --> 09:37.119
another guy comes
from the bank,

09:37.194 --> 09:38.684
he takes my daddy's
property away.

09:38.762 --> 09:40.389
I've been paying
them back ever since.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.193
Listen. Well, by crackers,
we hit it.

09:43.267 --> 09:44.359
There we go.

09:44.434 --> 09:46.459
Holy... Come on.
Come on.

09:46.537 --> 09:47.799
There's something down there.

09:47.871 --> 09:50.931
Hey, there it is.
This is it.

09:51.074 --> 09:53.474
I knew this money could be
put to good use.

09:53.544 --> 09:55.409
It's gonna free my grandson.

10:15.331 --> 10:17.265
No one knew
about the money.

10:17.333 --> 10:18.857
Well,
somebody must have.

10:19.001 --> 10:22.630
I mean, $200,000 doesn't
just get out of a strongbox

10:22.705 --> 10:25.936
buried under
a massage parlor
and walk away.

10:26.008 --> 10:27.168
Somebody took it.

10:27.610 --> 10:31.341
Hardly an astute observation,
Magnum, but a correct one,
nevertheless.

10:32.314 --> 10:34.179
Who would have known
the money's location?

10:34.250 --> 10:36.946
Are you both deaf?
I keep telling you,

10:37.019 --> 10:40.887
nobody knows where that loot
was stashed except me.

10:40.990 --> 10:43.959
And the guys who took it.
What about your ex-partners?

10:44.693 --> 10:46.251
They were arrested before me.

10:46.328 --> 10:48.888
Yeah, but Mortie and Slick
served shorter sentences.

10:48.964 --> 10:51.398
You could've
told them in prison.
Now, maybe you forgot.

10:51.667 --> 10:54.101
Maybe. Except they were
in different prisons.

10:55.938 --> 10:58.372
Oh. Well, what about
your lawyer?

10:58.507 --> 11:01.408
Harry? Now, you leave
Harry Clayborn out of this.

11:01.477 --> 11:04.105
Poor Harry's got enough
problems, like having me
for a client.

11:04.180 --> 11:07.377
Lost all 12 cases.
Harry wouldn't steal from me.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.178
But you could have told him.

11:09.251 --> 11:10.809
But I didn't.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.744
I tell you, guys,
there's nobody left.

11:17.059 --> 11:18.583
Well, what about your son?

11:18.661 --> 11:21.095
I remember you were telling me
about your son.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.262
Higgo, my son's dead.

11:25.801 --> 11:27.792
I never saw
too much of him

11:27.870 --> 11:29.633
and maybe that's why
we didn't get along so good.

11:30.472 --> 11:33.930
Garwood Jr. Had his own
construction company.

11:34.009 --> 11:38.139
Then about two years ago,
why, he got killed
on a construction site.

11:38.581 --> 11:40.515
Explosives accident.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.975
Weren't nothing left of him
but his boots.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.120
I'm sorry.

11:49.091 --> 11:54.051
Look, Garwood, even though
your partners and Harry didn't
know where the money was,

11:54.129 --> 11:55.619
they obviously knew
it existed,

11:55.698 --> 11:57.962
so that doesn't rule them out
as kidnapping suspects.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.628
You have a point, Magnum.

11:59.702 --> 12:02.762
Yeah, so what I think
we gotta do
is track them down.

12:02.838 --> 12:04.328
And then we'll find
your grandson.

12:04.406 --> 12:07.068
My partners and Harry
ain't crooks.

12:07.142 --> 12:08.473
Well, they're bank robbers.

12:08.544 --> 12:09.704
That's different.

12:09.778 --> 12:11.405
Gentlemen. Garwood,
Magnum, please.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.243
We're wasting precious time.

12:13.449 --> 12:16.043
Magnum is right.
The only thing we have
to go on at the moment is

12:16.118 --> 12:18.609
Mortie, Slick and Harry's
knowledge of the hidden money.

12:18.687 --> 12:22.214
And as much as it may pain you
that one of them might have
committed this heinous act,

12:22.291 --> 12:24.191
it has to be considered
and investigated.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.723
And perhaps one of them
was bitter and jealous
over your notoriety.

12:28.063 --> 12:29.724
It could have been
any number of things.

12:30.165 --> 12:32.599
It reminds me very much
of a time in Salzburg
back in...

12:32.668 --> 12:35.865
Okay, okay, Higgo.
We'll check them out.
We'll check them all out.

12:35.938 --> 12:38.839
No. Not we, me.

12:38.908 --> 12:41.069
Me. I will check them out.

12:41.143 --> 12:42.735
We're talking about
my grandson.

12:42.811 --> 12:46.008
We're talking
about the possibility of you
getting arrested,

12:46.081 --> 12:47.070
or rearrested,

12:47.149 --> 12:49.174
andlor me getting arrested
with you.

12:50.185 --> 12:52.551
Now, Higgins, if I'm gonna
commit half-a-dozen felonies

12:52.621 --> 12:54.350
trying to get this man's
grandson back,

12:54.623 --> 12:56.955
we're gonna do it my way.
He stays here.

12:57.393 --> 12:58.621
Understood?

13:00.195 --> 13:01.560
Understood.

13:02.231 --> 13:05.496
Well, you better
get cracking, Magnum.
You have less than 27 hours.

13:07.770 --> 13:10.170
<i>I left Garwood</i>
<i>at the estate with Higgins.</i>

13:10.239 --> 13:13.800
<i>I knew that as long</i>
<i>as they were reliving</i>
<i>tales from the past,</i>

13:13.876 --> 13:16.674
<i>they wouldn't stop</i>
<i>to think about the very</i>
<i>frightening possibility</i>

13:16.745 --> 13:18.610
<i>we were facing</i>
<i>in the present.</i>

13:19.081 --> 13:22.380
<i>There was every likelihood</i>
<i>the kidnappers wouldn't</i>
<i>return the little boy,</i>

13:22.451 --> 13:24.510
<i>even if we did</i>
<i>come up with the money.</i>

13:24.586 --> 13:28.078
<i>I had to do everything</i>
<i>I could to find him</i>
<i>before our time ran out,</i>

13:28.724 --> 13:32.125
<i>so I started where</i>
<i>any good private investigator</i>
<i>would start.</i>

13:32.227 --> 13:33.694
<i>The scene of the crime.</i>

13:33.762 --> 13:37.163
<i>Maybe Frannie Huddle</i>
<i>and her fianc√©, Walt,</i>
<i>could tell me something</i>

13:37.232 --> 13:39.359
<i>they hadn't told the police.</i>

13:39.935 --> 13:41.527
Yeah, what can I do for you?
Walt Brewster?

13:41.603 --> 13:43.503
Oh, yeah, you're the guy
Ed sent over, huh?
Come on in.

13:43.572 --> 13:44.800
Uh, no, I'm Thomas Magnum.

13:44.873 --> 13:47.103
Yeah, right, you look
like a Tom. Let me show
you what we got here.

13:48.610 --> 13:49.941
This is your basic
starter kit.

13:50.012 --> 13:51.809
You got your cosmetics,
a few household products.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.438
This stuff sells itself.
There you go.
Good luck.

13:53.515 --> 13:56.416
Wait a minute.
No, look, I don't have time
to go into details with you.

13:56.518 --> 13:58.179
Look, we've had
a few problems
around here, okay?

13:58.253 --> 13:59.447
Ed will explain
everything to you.

13:59.521 --> 14:00.783
Ed did not send me.

14:01.190 --> 14:02.179
Garwood did.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.322
Frannie! Frannie!

14:07.529 --> 14:09.463
Frannie, meet Tom.

14:12.201 --> 14:13.998
Oh, Walt, please not...
Garwood sent him.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.598
You know where
he's hiding out?

14:21.010 --> 14:22.671
No, he called.

14:22.878 --> 14:25.176
Yeah, well, we've had
cops here around the clock
since he busted out.

14:25.247 --> 14:27.977
One of them just left a little
while ago to check out
some leads or something.

14:28.050 --> 14:29.108
Said he'd be back.

14:29.184 --> 14:31.175
Look, what can you tell me
about the kidnapping?

14:31.253 --> 14:33.016
Did you see anybody?

14:33.689 --> 14:35.884
Yesterday afternoon
I was washing dishes.

14:36.091 --> 14:38.082
Little Garwood was playing
on the kitchen floor.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.525
I turned around and...

14:40.396 --> 14:41.829
And he was gone.

14:42.698 --> 14:44.563
Now, you get a message
to Garwood.

14:44.733 --> 14:46.997
I know he's out there
trying to help, but he isn't.

14:47.069 --> 14:49.936
Half of the police force
is out there looking for him
instead of my baby.

14:50.005 --> 14:52.803
You tell him that.
Tell him to give himself up.

14:53.108 --> 14:55.008
A Huddle
never gives up.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.340
Garwood?

14:59.014 --> 15:01.312
Garwood...
Uh-oh, we got trouble.

15:01.717 --> 15:03.082
I told you he'd be back.

15:03.719 --> 15:06.153
What are you doing?
You should give
yourself up.

15:06.221 --> 15:07.882
No way, Frannie.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.819
Not on your sweet life.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.220
Not until I have
my grandson back.

15:14.763 --> 15:18.130
Well, hey, look, look.
Just slip out the back way
and take this junk with you

15:18.233 --> 15:19.757
in case he sees you.
Come on.

15:19.835 --> 15:22.668
We're not going anywhere
until she tells us
everything she knows.

15:22.738 --> 15:24.433
She already has.
Come on.

15:25.207 --> 15:26.504
He's coming up the path.

15:27.676 --> 15:28.734
Garwood.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.505
We're gonna find him,
Frannie, I promise.

15:30.579 --> 15:32.672
Get out of here, Garwood,
right now.

15:33.048 --> 15:35.642
Get out. I mean it.
Right now.

15:42.357 --> 15:44.621
Oh, Sergeant.
Come on in.

15:46.428 --> 15:49.693
I'm afraid none of your leads
panned out, Mr. Brewster.

15:53.302 --> 15:54.997
I thought we had
an understanding.

15:55.137 --> 15:56.331
I lied.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.739
Garwood, you are getting
in my way.

16:00.008 --> 16:02.442
Well, I am afraid that's just
the way it's gonna have to be.

16:02.511 --> 16:05.605
I'm not gonna sit around
and watch the clock tick down
on my grandson.

16:05.681 --> 16:07.148
Well, you could of got us
both arrested.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.774
Then who would've found
your little grandson?

16:08.851 --> 16:10.751
We ain't arrested.
We're riding around

16:10.819 --> 16:13.686
in this fancy, red,
Italian racecar of yours.

16:13.755 --> 16:15.484
Real inconspicuous.

16:15.657 --> 16:19.252
<i>El</i> Higgo told me you were
very good, but I'm beginning
to wonder, buddy.

16:19.528 --> 16:20.620
He said that?

16:20.796 --> 16:23.492
Well, yeah, I am good.
I'm very good.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.089
What exactly did he say?

16:25.934 --> 16:27.333
What's your next move?

16:27.402 --> 16:29.233
Well, I'm gonna take
you back to <i>el</i> Higgo.

16:29.304 --> 16:30.396
Then what?

16:30.472 --> 16:32.372
Then I'm gonna see
your lawyer, Harry.

16:32.441 --> 16:34.068
Then what?
Then I'll let you know!

16:34.143 --> 16:35.667
Hell, man,
I can't wait!

16:35.777 --> 16:36.869
Well, neither can I!

16:36.945 --> 16:39.880
Our time's running out.
You can't do everything
yourself, you know.

16:39.982 --> 16:41.313
I got that covered.

16:41.450 --> 16:42.542
How?

16:51.760 --> 16:52.749
What'll you have?

16:52.828 --> 16:54.693
Roast beef
and gefilte fish on white,

16:54.763 --> 16:56.993
mustard, light on
the ketchup.

16:57.966 --> 16:59.763
Dill and a toothpick?

17:00.035 --> 17:01.366
No, Ice Pick.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.566
When you've worked
as many years as I have,
it's hard to retire.

17:09.810 --> 17:12.575
That's why I keep a hand
in this new identity business.

17:13.315 --> 17:15.545
Ice Pick, if you can just help
me with these two guys.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.017
I never ask my customers
their real names.

17:18.353 --> 17:19.786
I just change them.

17:20.622 --> 17:23.215
Arnold Simms
and Mortie Anderson?

17:25.093 --> 17:27.721
Slick? Yeah, him I remember.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.191
Yeah, impatient.

17:29.498 --> 17:31.557
He busted parole
the day he got out.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.625
I told him, "Listen, Slick,
you're crazy to stay
on this island."

17:34.703 --> 17:37.228
But he thought he knew more
than old Ice Pick.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.537
So you gave him
a new name?

17:39.908 --> 17:41.341
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

17:41.410 --> 17:43.878
Oh, here it is.
William Daniels. Yeah.

17:44.479 --> 17:47.744
New driver's license,
social security number,

17:48.183 --> 17:50.777
birth certificate,
credit cards.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.015
I even gave him
a high-school diploma.

17:54.790 --> 17:58.089
Mortie Anderson?
No, I never fixed him up.

17:58.293 --> 17:59.885
William Daniels.

18:00.062 --> 18:01.290
Thanks, Ice Pick.

18:01.496 --> 18:03.964
Still want that roast beef
and gefilte fish sandwich?

18:04.266 --> 18:05.961
I don't have time. Thanks.

18:06.034 --> 18:08.161
Good. 'Cause I don't have
the heart to fix it.

18:08.904 --> 18:10.269
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

18:10.572 --> 18:12.665
<i>I'd been bending</i>
<i>a lot of rules lately.</i>

18:13.308 --> 18:16.209
<i>The kind of bending</i>
<i>that they not only</i>
<i>pull your license for,</i>

18:16.278 --> 18:17.267
<i>they pull you.</i>

18:17.579 --> 18:19.740
<i>But when you figure</i>
<i>that in the last twelve hours</i>

18:19.815 --> 18:22.283
<i>I had aided and abetted</i>
<i>an escaped convict,</i>

18:22.351 --> 18:23.750
<i>held someone</i>
<i>against their will</i>

18:23.819 --> 18:25.719
<i>and destroyed</i>
<i>private property,</i>

18:25.787 --> 18:29.154
<i>what's a little breaking</i>
<i>and entering with some</i>
<i>petty theft on the side?</i>

18:29.658 --> 18:31.387
<i>Probably 5 to 15.</i>

18:31.660 --> 18:34.424
<i>But at least it was</i>
<i>for a damned good cause.</i>

18:38.667 --> 18:39.725
Can I help you?

18:39.835 --> 18:41.826
All right, who are you
and how'd you get in here?

18:42.571 --> 18:44.471
Harry Clayborn and Son?

18:44.740 --> 18:46.139
Forget about the son.

18:46.508 --> 18:48.669
He decided to become an actor.

18:49.077 --> 18:51.136
Five years of
law-school tuition,

18:51.213 --> 18:54.046
and all I bought was
a generic Gielgud.

18:54.116 --> 18:55.913
How much you still owe
on his education?

18:55.984 --> 18:57.576
All right, cut it.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.552
Magnum, this is not
a good place for you to be.

19:01.456 --> 19:04.619
Cops are in and out of here
at all hours ever since
Garwood escaped.

19:04.760 --> 19:09.561
Fortunately, a ritzy estate
is not on their list of places
they'd expect him to show up.

19:09.631 --> 19:10.962
How'd you know who I was?

19:11.066 --> 19:12.499
Garwood called me.

19:13.602 --> 19:17.038
Said as long as you wouldn't
let him come personally,
it was the least he could do.

19:20.876 --> 19:23.367
By the way,
who is <i>el</i> Higgo?

19:25.180 --> 19:26.442
Never mind that, Harry.

19:26.515 --> 19:29.678
I want to know where
to find Slick Simms
andlor Mortie Anderson.

19:29.751 --> 19:30.911
So does everybody.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.911
Those guys haven't been
on this island in four years.

19:34.189 --> 19:37.215
Yeah, well,
we have till 2:00

19:37.459 --> 19:40.917
tomorrow afternoon to either
find his grandson's kidnappers

19:40.996 --> 19:42.657
or the money
they want or both.

19:42.731 --> 19:45.097
Now, since you know where
the two prime suspects are

19:45.200 --> 19:46.565
and you won't tell me,

19:46.768 --> 19:48.963
I have got to presume
that you're involved.

19:49.037 --> 19:50.868
Presume what you want.
I don't care.

19:51.573 --> 19:52.835
I don't know.

19:53.542 --> 19:54.907
Look, do you mind?

19:55.577 --> 19:57.272
This is a record
of your telephone calls.

19:57.346 --> 19:58.335
Yeah, I know that.

19:58.714 --> 20:00.011
Yeah, well, I found it
in your files.

20:00.082 --> 20:03.415
You know, as recently
as two weeks ago some guy
named Slick called you.

20:03.919 --> 20:05.352
How many people you know
named Slick?

20:05.420 --> 20:07.479
Several. They all call me.

20:07.956 --> 20:11.050
I know a car dealer
named Slick and a judge,

20:11.126 --> 20:12.753
a lady I date occasionally.

20:12.861 --> 20:14.886
Face it, it's a very
common name, Slick.

20:15.364 --> 20:17.764
Well, be that
as it may, Harry,

20:17.833 --> 20:19.926
you really should
lock up your files.

20:20.235 --> 20:23.204
I found your insurance
claimant cases
just fascinating.

20:23.338 --> 20:25.533
They're very slick,
speaking of slick.

20:25.607 --> 20:28.599
You know, as a matter of fact,
even if you're not involved
in the kidnapping,

20:28.677 --> 20:30.702
there's enough in here
to get you disbarred.

20:30.779 --> 20:33.805
Maybe even get you a suite
next to Garwood's
when he goes to jail.

20:37.386 --> 20:39.320
Slick Simms
and Mortie Anderson.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.055
All right, all right.

20:42.124 --> 20:44.285
I really don't know
anything about Slick.

20:44.459 --> 20:49.294
But Mortie's last address
is 1414 Aloona,

20:49.965 --> 20:51.432
number 246.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.491
How old's this address?

20:54.870 --> 20:56.360
Eleven months.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.234
Eleven months.

20:59.708 --> 21:01.403
And you haven't
talked to him at all
since then?

21:01.676 --> 21:04.873
No, I have not. I swear.

21:44.319 --> 21:47.311
Very funny.
Very funny.

21:59.584 --> 22:02.712
Nice move, Magnum.
It's gonna cost me
a fortune to replace that.

22:02.987 --> 22:05.888
Don't bother. I don't think
they let you practice law
in prison.

22:06.658 --> 22:09.593
Oh, if you're talking
about those fascinating
insurance files,

22:09.661 --> 22:11.788
they accidentally got burned
while you were gone.

22:12.330 --> 22:14.855
I always wanted
a fireplace in here.

22:14.933 --> 22:17.731
I'm talking about
attempted murder, Harry.

22:19.437 --> 22:22.838
I'd be careful who I was
slinging accusations at, pal.

22:22.907 --> 22:25.171
You shot at me
in the cemetery.

22:25.243 --> 22:28.007
What do you take me for,
some kind of a weirdo

22:28.079 --> 22:30.343
who goes around
shooting up
his best friend's grave?

22:30.448 --> 22:32.382
Look, no one else knew
where I was going.

22:32.584 --> 22:35.178
You're the gumshoe.
Figure it out.
You were tailed.

22:35.887 --> 22:38.287
All I wanted to do was
get rid of you long enough

22:38.356 --> 22:39.983
to clean up my files.

22:41.159 --> 22:42.217
All right.

22:43.061 --> 22:45.052
Just for a second,
let's say I believe you.

22:48.733 --> 22:51.099
With Mortie dead, that leaves
Slick Simms. Where's he?

22:51.369 --> 22:54.634
Who knows? Last I heard
he was picking coffee beans
in Costa Rica.

22:55.340 --> 22:59.106
Harry, I'm tired
and I'm angry

22:59.177 --> 23:00.838
and I don't believe you.

23:00.912 --> 23:03.904
Now, I've committed just about
every crime short of murder
over the last day.

23:04.015 --> 23:06.040
Now, time is running out here,

23:07.285 --> 23:09.412
and unless you want me
to start considering murder,

23:09.521 --> 23:11.955
I suggest you tell me
where to find
William Daniels.

23:12.690 --> 23:13.748
Who?

23:13.892 --> 23:17.055
William "l-used-to-be-Slick-
till-l-changed-my-identity"
Daniels.

23:17.128 --> 23:18.652
He's in the islands.

23:18.730 --> 23:22.029
Slick is back?
God, I wish he'd gotten
in touch with me.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.795
That guy is a magnet
with women.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.927
We'd just sit in the bar...
Harry!

23:27.972 --> 23:32.204
Magnum, I swear
I haven't seen him.

23:34.078 --> 23:37.980
Look, really,
I'd like that kid back
just as much as Garwood.

23:38.383 --> 23:41.181
Now, Garwood knows that
even if you don't believe it.

23:53.031 --> 23:54.293
You know,

23:54.666 --> 23:57.635
you really ought to
get your copy machine
checked out, Harry.

23:58.703 --> 24:00.728
I think it's low on toner.

24:02.340 --> 24:05.537
These really are fascinating.
I'll see you, Harry.

24:07.078 --> 24:09.945
And you wonder
why people shoot at you.

24:22.894 --> 24:24.225
I'll be back.

24:29.534 --> 24:32.628
<i>Will you forget</i>
<i>about Harry?</i>
<i>He's good people.</i>

24:32.737 --> 24:33.999
He shot at me.

24:34.138 --> 24:36.538
Not Harry.
He don't like guns.
What about Slick?

24:36.674 --> 24:39.541
I'm having a friend
check him out
under his new identity.

24:39.611 --> 24:42.239
At least I'm glad old Mortie
didn't have a hand in this.

24:42.313 --> 24:43.974
I am sorry
he's dead, though.

24:44.148 --> 24:46.946
Magnum, are you cooking
Brussel sprouts?

24:47.051 --> 24:48.040
No.

24:48.186 --> 24:49.448
Then what is it
that I smell?

24:49.621 --> 24:50.610
Patchismo.

24:51.189 --> 24:52.315
I beg your pardon?

24:52.390 --> 24:55.416
You used some
of the cologne out of
that Patplan starter kit

24:55.493 --> 24:56.482
Walt gave you,
didn't you?

24:57.362 --> 24:59.592
Well, yeah,
I did try some on.

25:00.031 --> 25:01.464
Don't worry, Higgins,
it'll wash off.

25:01.532 --> 25:05.127
Won't do any good.
Walt sent me one of those kits
out to the pen.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.431
Why, the inmates started
getting these rashes,

25:07.505 --> 25:10.474
smelling like vegetables.
I had to get myself
thrown into solitary.

25:10.541 --> 25:13.305
I suggest you throw the rest
of the kit away immediately.

25:13.378 --> 25:15.005
I already gave
some of it away.

25:15.346 --> 25:17.439
Friend of yours came by
while you was out
getting shot at.

25:17.515 --> 25:21.110
I gave him some of that
Patplan wax, see, for his car.

25:22.587 --> 25:23.815
Here's the news report.

25:23.888 --> 25:25.583
<i>Police are still</i>
<i>without solid clues</i>

25:25.657 --> 25:28.023
<i>as they frantically</i>
<i>comb the island</i>
<i>for the second day.</i>

25:28.192 --> 25:31.491
<i>News Two's Sheila Shay</i>
<i>has been following the bizarre</i>
<i>double Huddle disappearance,</i>

25:31.930 --> 25:33.295
<i>and she has</i>
<i>this special report.</i>

25:33.364 --> 25:34.353
<i>Thanks, Dan.</i>

25:35.533 --> 25:37.398
<i>Garwood Granville Huddle,</i>

25:37.468 --> 25:38.901
<i>age 65,</i>

25:38.970 --> 25:41.768
<i>a name synonymous</i>
<i>with crime for 40 years,</i>

25:41.839 --> 25:44.433
<i>and once again</i>
<i>a man on the run.</i>

25:44.642 --> 25:46.974
<i>Garwood Granville Huddle</i>
<i>the Third,</i>

25:47.045 --> 25:49.673
<i>age two this Saturday,</i>
<i>kidnapped.</i>

25:50.181 --> 25:52.911
<i>Perhaps the victim</i>
<i>of the Huddle legacy.</i>

25:53.284 --> 25:55.980
<i>Here with me today</i>
<i>are Frannie Huddle,</i>

25:56.220 --> 25:59.849
<i>Garwood's mother,</i>
<i>and Walter Brewster,</i>
<i>her fianc√©,</i>

25:59.958 --> 26:02.188
<i>here at</i>
<i>a very difficult time,</i>

26:02.627 --> 26:06.085
<i>wanting your help</i>
<i>and also to plead</i>
<i>with the kidnappers</i>

26:06.164 --> 26:07.927
<i>for his safe return.</i>

26:08.700 --> 26:10.691
<i>I just want</i>
<i>my baby back.</i>

26:12.136 --> 26:15.628
<i>Frannie, do you think</i>
<i>there could possibly</i>
<i>be some connection</i>

26:15.707 --> 26:17.538
<i>between the two</i>
<i>disappearances?</i>

26:17.675 --> 26:21.338
<i>I just think he's</i>
<i>out there somewhere</i>
<i>looking for his grandson.</i>

26:21.646 --> 26:24.308
<i>He didn't escape until</i>
<i>after little Garwood was...</i>

26:24.882 --> 26:27.646
<i>Perhaps there could be</i>
<i>some connection.</i>

26:27.719 --> 26:30.779
<i>Maybe it would be of help</i>
<i>if you could tell us</i>
<i>what he was wearing.</i>

26:32.290 --> 26:36.386
<i>He had on a little</i>
<i>blue and white</i>
<i>striped T-shirt.</i>

26:37.128 --> 26:40.291
<i>And a little pair</i>
<i>of Patpants.</i>

26:40.598 --> 26:41.656
<i>Red.</i>

26:41.733 --> 26:45.669
<i>And a pair of white</i>
<i>size-two sneakers.</i>

26:46.070 --> 26:47.162
<i>That's right.</i>

26:47.238 --> 26:50.605
<i>And if anyone hasn't</i>
<i>taken it away from him,</i>

26:50.742 --> 26:52.539
<i>which is hard to do,</i>

26:53.444 --> 26:55.742
<i>he always has</i>
<i>his Pattybear.</i>

26:57.181 --> 26:58.808
<i>No, he didn't, Walt.</i>

27:00.251 --> 27:03.414
<i>No, it must've left</i>
<i>with him because</i>
<i>he always holds onto it.</i>

27:03.488 --> 27:05.319
<i>Anyway, I looked around</i>
<i>the house and it wasn't there.</i>

27:05.656 --> 27:07.021
<i>A Pattybear?</i>

27:07.091 --> 27:08.183
<i>He doesn't have it.</i>

27:08.493 --> 27:10.518
<i>It was on the...</i>
<i>It was on the floor.</i>

27:11.095 --> 27:13.086
<i>No, he has the bear,</i>
<i>sweetheart.</i>

27:13.831 --> 27:15.526
<i>Please,</i>
<i>we'll discuss this</i>
<i>later at home.</i>

27:15.600 --> 27:17.227
Very funny, you guys.

27:17.301 --> 27:19.064
That's the guy I gave
the Patwax to.

27:19.203 --> 27:21.068
Somebody's gonna
pay for this.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.663
<i>Don't confuse</i>
<i>the viewers.</i>

27:22.740 --> 27:25.675
I have taken
your practical jokes
for the last time.

27:25.777 --> 27:27.870
T.C., we're trying
to watch this.

27:28.079 --> 27:29.205
<i>You're the one</i>
<i>that's confused here.</i>

27:29.347 --> 27:30.905
<i>I'm not confused.</i>

27:30.982 --> 27:32.506
<i>I saw it in the living room</i>

27:32.583 --> 27:34.244
<i>after they took</i>
<i>little Garwood.</i>

27:34.318 --> 27:36.047
T. C: I waxed the van.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.678
That stuff took
the paint right off.

27:37.755 --> 27:40.087
I am talking
down to the metal, off!

27:40.158 --> 27:41.455
Uh, T.C.

27:41.592 --> 27:44.561
<i>Calm down, sweetheart.</i>
<i>Maybe he didn't</i>
<i>have the bear.</i>

27:44.662 --> 27:46.857
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>we ask that anyone</i>

27:46.931 --> 27:49.798
<i>having knowledge</i>
<i>of Garwood Granville</i>
<i>Huddle the Third's...</i>

27:49.867 --> 27:51.767
T. C: Oh, no, you're not gonna
get away with this this time.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.827
You know how much
it's gonna cost me
to repaint the van?

27:53.938 --> 27:55.132
<i>...who abducted him</i>
<i>from his home</i>

27:55.206 --> 27:57.003
<i>to please, please</i>
<i>call this number.</i>

27:57.075 --> 27:59.100
Did he say kidnapping?

28:01.145 --> 28:03.340
<i>I'm sure that Mr. Brewster</i>
<i>and Mrs. Huddle...</i>
Hello.

28:03.414 --> 28:04.608
Yeah, Rick.

28:05.349 --> 28:06.839
My grandson.

28:07.418 --> 28:09.045
I'm sorry about
that Patwax.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.678
I never should've
given it to you.

28:10.755 --> 28:13.189
Yeah, but you guys
didn't say anything
about a kidnapping

28:13.257 --> 28:14.622
when I was here before.

28:14.692 --> 28:17.820
We felt it necessary
to keep Mr. Huddle's
identity a secret.

28:18.563 --> 28:21.088
I'm surprised you didn't see
my mug on the TV news.

28:21.165 --> 28:22.598
I've been on all day.

28:23.768 --> 28:26.032
I was busy waxing my van.

28:26.170 --> 28:27.637
Great! You got it?

28:27.705 --> 28:29.036
I'll get
right over there.

28:29.107 --> 28:30.438
Rick got Slick's address.

28:30.508 --> 28:31.998
What are we waiting for?
Let's ride!

28:32.076 --> 28:33.839
No. You're not
riding anywhere.

28:33.945 --> 28:35.606
Where are we going
to track down our lead?

28:35.680 --> 28:38.171
Harbourfront Condominiums.
What do you mean, "our lead"?

28:38.249 --> 28:40.581
Hey, I don't have time for you
to weasel me into helping you.

28:40.685 --> 28:42.915
This is important.
But when it is over,

28:42.987 --> 28:45.319
we are going to talk
about my van.

28:45.389 --> 28:46.754
Great. I'll meet you there.

28:48.025 --> 28:49.822
You guys smell
something funny?

29:05.877 --> 29:07.003
Thank you.

29:11.649 --> 29:13.617
Half a mil.
Slick must be doing okay.

29:13.684 --> 29:16.278
Yeah, and $200,000
is just about right
for a down payment.

29:16.521 --> 29:17.818
You know,
there's that smell again.

29:17.889 --> 29:20.357
Smells kind of funny,
like old gym shorts.

29:20.458 --> 29:21.652
Do you smell it, Thomas?

29:23.027 --> 29:24.085
It's getting worse.

29:24.162 --> 29:26.153
Smells like somebody
in here's cooking
Brussel sprouts.

29:26.230 --> 29:28.255
Okay, okay!

29:29.467 --> 29:30.695
Okay. It's me.

29:30.768 --> 29:33.794
Some guy gave me this sample
of Patchismo cologne.

29:34.472 --> 29:35.769
Patchismo?

29:36.374 --> 29:38.569
Is this the same guy
that gave you the Patwax?

29:38.643 --> 29:41.373
Yes. And I put some on
and now I can't wash it off.

29:42.246 --> 29:44.510
Man, you should have
smelled that stuff
before you put it on.

29:44.582 --> 29:46.447
Well, it doesn't smell
like anything.

29:46.517 --> 29:48.917
It's supposed to take on
your own natural scent.

29:49.787 --> 29:52.585
Boy, if that's
your natural scent,
you got a serious problem.

29:53.524 --> 29:55.082
Look, will you stop it,
please,

29:55.159 --> 29:57.286
and come and help me
find William Daniels?

29:57.361 --> 29:59.420
Yeah, sure.
You just stay downwind.

30:03.434 --> 30:04.696
Can I help you?

30:05.736 --> 30:08.136
Oh, hi.
We're looking for a guy
named William Daniels.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.398
Daniels.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.637
No one by that name
lives here.

30:12.944 --> 30:15.003
Oh, well, maybe he moved in
on your day off.

30:15.112 --> 30:17.706
Uh-uh. I know
everybody here.

30:17.815 --> 30:18.907
It's my job.

30:18.983 --> 30:22.544
Are you sure? William Daniels.
We were told he was here.

30:22.787 --> 30:23.947
Sorry.

30:25.423 --> 30:26.583
Thanks for the help, Slick.

30:26.657 --> 30:27.851
No problem.

30:37.735 --> 30:38.963
Come on, Slick.

30:39.537 --> 30:40.595
Slick!

30:41.038 --> 30:43.802
Look, we just wanna
talk to you.

30:43.874 --> 30:45.341
Yeah, downtown, I suppose.

30:45.409 --> 30:47.343
Well, that might not be
a bad idea.

30:48.279 --> 30:49.268
Oh.

30:50.815 --> 30:52.248
I thought you didn't
like guns.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.477
Me? That was Garwood
and Mortie.

30:54.552 --> 30:55.814
I love guns.

30:56.487 --> 30:58.512
Then you took a shot at me
in the cemetery?

30:58.956 --> 31:00.787
I never saw you before.

31:00.858 --> 31:02.450
Then why were you
running away?

31:02.593 --> 31:04.788
Because I'm still wanted
for busting parole.

31:04.862 --> 31:06.625
You know that.
You're here to take me in.

31:06.697 --> 31:08.665
No, we didn't.
Look, we're not cops.

31:09.233 --> 31:11.360
Come on, now, why don't you
just give me that gun?
Come on.

31:11.969 --> 31:13.698
Just hold it right there.

31:21.045 --> 31:23.172
T. C: Somebody,
call an ambulance!

31:29.487 --> 31:32.354
<i>Slick was off</i>
<i>to the hospital with</i>
<i>a bullet in his back,</i>

31:32.456 --> 31:34.856
<i>my third strikeout</i>
<i>with suspects.</i>

31:34.925 --> 31:37.291
<i>But I had a reassuring fact</i>
<i>to console me.</i>

31:37.361 --> 31:40.125
<i>You see, Babe Ruth</i>
<i>struck out, too.</i>

31:40.364 --> 31:43.333
<i>1330 times, in fact.</i>

31:43.567 --> 31:46.764
<i>Of course, it's only</i>
<i>the 714 homers we remember.</i>

31:47.138 --> 31:48.537
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

31:49.006 --> 31:52.203
<i>What does that to do with</i>
<i>the fact that Garwood</i>
<i>was sitting next to me</i>

31:52.276 --> 31:54.369
<i>after I'd insisted</i>
<i>he couldn't come along?</i>

31:54.779 --> 31:57.441
<i>Well, I still had</i>
<i>one last chance</i>

31:57.515 --> 31:59.449
<i>to come out of this game</i>
<i>with a homer of my own.</i>

31:59.517 --> 32:01.178
<i>There was one last suspect,</i>

32:01.252 --> 32:02.241
<i>a dead one,</i>

32:02.553 --> 32:04.384
<i>and only Garwood</i>
<i>could identify him.</i>

32:04.455 --> 32:06.423
<i>If he did, he'd be</i>
<i>throwing me the pitch</i>

32:06.490 --> 32:08.788
<i>that I would blast</i>
<i>into the upper deck.</i>

32:08.893 --> 32:10.861
I knew it!
- Yeah. What'd you know?

32:10.928 --> 32:12.088
I was right.

32:12.163 --> 32:13.630
Good for you.
Right about what?

32:13.698 --> 32:14.995
The massage parlor.

32:15.066 --> 32:17.091
When you said
it was a vacant lot
six years ago,

32:17.168 --> 32:18.192
I started thinking.

32:18.269 --> 32:20.294
Maybe somebody
on the construction
crew took it.

32:20.371 --> 32:22.771
I guess bulldozers do dig up
a lot of money.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.603
And your son had
a construction company.

32:24.709 --> 32:25.698
Huh?

32:26.577 --> 32:28.670
I'll be doggone!

32:28.879 --> 32:31.245
Garwood Jr. Built
that massage parlor.

32:31.382 --> 32:33.247
Don't you see?
He took the money.

32:34.485 --> 32:35.747
Well, he could have.

32:35.886 --> 32:39.185
But a fat lot of good
that's gonna do us now,
seeing as how he's dead.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.155
Yeah, unless he didn't
take it with him.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.352
Or unless he didn't go.

33:00.311 --> 33:01.437
Hi, there.
Hi.

33:01.579 --> 33:05.140
I'll have a roast beef
and gefilte fish on white,

33:05.249 --> 33:07.342
with mustard
and light on the ketchup.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.350
I'll just have the ribs,
if you got them.

33:10.254 --> 33:12.085
What do you guys
really want?

33:12.523 --> 33:14.650
Something for Ice Pick.
To go.

33:21.065 --> 33:23.863
I've always been an admirer
of your work, Mr. Huddle.

33:23.934 --> 33:26.596
Yeah, it had a lot of style
and class.

33:26.670 --> 33:29.161
I'm just a country boy
trying to get along.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.798
Always was,
always will be.

33:30.875 --> 33:34.003
I know, but a new identity,
it's gonna be rough.
You're so well-known.

33:34.078 --> 33:37.013
Well, we're not looking
for a new identity
for Garwood.

33:37.081 --> 33:38.639
We're looking for his son.

33:38.716 --> 33:42.914
I tried to explain to Rick,
I can't give out the names
of my customers.

33:42.987 --> 33:44.352
It's not good
for business.

33:44.422 --> 33:46.686
Dangedest thing.
I've been going along

33:46.857 --> 33:49.325
thinking my son was dead.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.119
My only son.

33:52.296 --> 33:54.230
Trying to make my peace
with that idea.

33:54.331 --> 33:57.061
Then this city boy, here,
he puts the notion
into my head

33:57.134 --> 33:59.432
that maybe he's still alive

33:59.537 --> 34:01.835
and just using
some new name and all,

34:01.906 --> 34:04.170
you know, and I figure
if he's still alive

34:04.241 --> 34:05.538
I gotta find him.

34:05.743 --> 34:06.869
Here.

34:07.378 --> 34:11.041
This here is a picture
of little Garwood the Third.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.643
Boy, I guess I love
that little tyke

34:13.717 --> 34:15.581
more than anything
in this whole world.

34:17.353 --> 34:19.117
Do you have grandchildren?

34:20.291 --> 34:22.485
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Quite a few.

34:25.896 --> 34:27.487
Yeah, here.

34:29.065 --> 34:30.498
That's my favorite.

34:30.601 --> 34:31.590
Butch.

34:32.803 --> 34:35.567
That lousy son-in-law,
he sent him off
to the mainland.

34:35.639 --> 34:37.833
He said he shouldn't
be associating
with people like me.

34:39.409 --> 34:41.378
Well, that's
a fine-Iooking boy.

34:42.045 --> 34:44.810
Little Garwood here
has been kidnapped.

34:45.149 --> 34:46.342
Maybe you heard.

34:57.661 --> 34:59.185
Finding Garwood Jr.

34:59.263 --> 35:01.663
Is our only hope of getting
this man's grandson back.

35:02.700 --> 35:05.066
If anything was to happen
to that little fella,

35:05.135 --> 35:07.126
I just don't know.

35:18.382 --> 35:19.576
Dad?

35:25.138 --> 35:26.628
I thought you were dead.

35:27.207 --> 35:28.674
I thought you were in prison.

35:31.478 --> 35:32.877
Where's the money, boy?

35:35.248 --> 35:37.045
Take your partner
and get out of here.

35:37.117 --> 35:38.414
He's not my partner.

35:38.485 --> 35:41.386
That $200,000
that you stole,
now, where is that?

35:41.454 --> 35:42.785
Careful, careful.

35:42.856 --> 35:45.017
You might have to give back
your Father of the Year award.

35:45.225 --> 35:47.591
Take it easy, Garwood.
He is your son.

35:47.727 --> 35:50.560
What kind of son steals
from his own daddy?

35:51.131 --> 35:53.725
Well, it wasn't exactly
your money, Garwood.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.267
To hear him tell it,
it was.

35:55.502 --> 35:57.493
He never thought about
anybody but himself.

35:58.004 --> 35:59.835
Other people had
problems, too, you know.

35:59.906 --> 36:01.032
Problems?

36:01.107 --> 36:02.972
Pretty little wife,
baby on the way.

36:03.043 --> 36:05.773
Yeah, and a construction
company going bankrupt.

36:05.979 --> 36:07.844
Me and Frannie
fighting all the time.

36:08.315 --> 36:10.909
What would he know
about my life?
He was never there.

36:11.885 --> 36:14.285
Well, I'm sure
he wanted to be.

36:14.354 --> 36:16.481
He talks like I set out
to get arrested.

36:16.556 --> 36:18.387
Well, that was
the law's idea

36:18.458 --> 36:20.790
to keep me away
from my family, not mine.

36:20.994 --> 36:22.757
How's a kid supposed
to know the difference?

36:23.096 --> 36:24.620
Get out of here
and leave me alone.

36:24.731 --> 36:26.494
Not till we get
what we come for.

36:28.735 --> 36:29.963
The money's gone.

36:30.904 --> 36:31.893
I blew it.

36:38.445 --> 36:39.673
Funny, huh?

36:40.447 --> 36:42.972
All my life I looked up
to the great Garwood.

36:44.184 --> 36:46.914
I wanted to be with him so bad
I used to follow him around

36:47.654 --> 36:49.747
to the meetings
with his business partners,

36:50.357 --> 36:51.551
other women.

36:52.892 --> 36:55.156
I even spied on him
when he buried that money.

36:57.030 --> 36:58.622
By then, I'd started
to hate him.

37:00.533 --> 37:01.522
Look at me.

37:02.235 --> 37:03.668
I ended up just like him.

37:04.371 --> 37:05.497
I stole money.

37:06.639 --> 37:09.540
I even faked my own death
so I could abandon my family.

37:11.478 --> 37:12.536
What a legacy.

37:14.614 --> 37:16.673
At least I spent the money.
You'll never get it back.

37:16.750 --> 37:18.445
I ought to knock
your head off!

37:18.518 --> 37:19.815
I love you, too, Dad.

37:19.919 --> 37:22.149
Hey, look. Just knock it off,
will you? Both of you.

37:22.222 --> 37:23.211
Come on.

37:23.423 --> 37:25.288
Look at the two of you.
Fighting over what?

37:26.159 --> 37:28.787
Okay, so he wasn't
the best father
in the world.

37:28.862 --> 37:31.797
I'm sure you didn't win
any Great Son awards, either.
So what?

37:32.699 --> 37:34.360
Look, standing here
hating each other

37:34.434 --> 37:35.833
isn't gonna get
your son back.

37:38.538 --> 37:40.005
What's happened
to little Garwood?

37:41.007 --> 37:42.406
Somebody kidnapped him.

37:42.475 --> 37:45.535
Come on. I mean,
didn't you see the television
or read the newspapers?

37:45.945 --> 37:47.469
I sold the TV a week ago.

37:49.048 --> 37:50.606
Little Garwood
is kidnapped?

38:00.326 --> 38:01.850
I don't even know
what he looks like.

38:02.862 --> 38:04.830
And whose fault
is that?

38:05.665 --> 38:07.724
Come on, Magnum.
The money's gone.

38:09.269 --> 38:10.361
Dad.

38:16.109 --> 38:17.303
If you find him...

38:17.844 --> 38:19.072
When you find him...

38:25.251 --> 38:26.616
I've been saving this for him.

38:31.191 --> 38:32.453
I'll be doggone.

38:32.525 --> 38:36.427
This is the baseball glove
I bought you when you were
eight years old.

38:39.132 --> 38:40.622
You kept this?

38:42.569 --> 38:44.036
Some things
you never throw away.

38:58.184 --> 39:00.015
What are we gonna do, Magnum?

39:00.320 --> 39:02.754
Without that money,
little Garwood's a goner.

39:03.089 --> 39:04.556
I got a plan.

39:04.624 --> 39:05.852
Wanna let me in on it?

39:07.060 --> 39:08.049
Maybe.

39:09.262 --> 39:10.991
<i>I didn't</i>
<i>really have a plan.</i>

39:11.231 --> 39:13.597
<i>Not yet anyway.</i>
<i>Just a hunch,</i>

39:14.133 --> 39:15.395
<i>a strong hunch.</i>

39:15.802 --> 39:18.635
<i>I got it when I saw</i>
<i>Garwood Jr. 's old glove.</i>

39:19.138 --> 39:21.606
<i>I had something</i>
<i>I'd never thrown away, too.</i>

39:21.808 --> 39:23.605
<i>It was a stuffed yellow duck</i>

39:23.676 --> 39:25.439
<i>I got for my second Easter.</i>

39:25.745 --> 39:27.736
<i>That yellow duck went</i>
<i>everywhere with me,</i>

39:27.814 --> 39:30.806
<i>and by time I was five,</i>
<i>it was in pretty bad shape.</i>

39:30.950 --> 39:32.110
<i>But even though</i>
<i>it was falling apart,</i>

39:32.185 --> 39:33.311
<i>I still wouldn't give it up.</i>

39:33.386 --> 39:35.149
<i>My mom tried</i>
<i>bribery and teasing,</i>

39:35.221 --> 39:37.155
<i>but I held onto it</i>
<i>with both hands</i>

39:37.524 --> 39:41.187
<i>and when she tried to pry it</i>
<i>away, I started screaming</i>
<i>and screaming until...</i>

39:41.761 --> 39:44.252
<i>Well, anyway,</i>
<i>you see what I mean.</i>

39:44.531 --> 39:48.865
<i>My hunch was that little</i>
<i>Garwood felt the same way</i>
<i>about his Pattybear.</i>

39:54.240 --> 39:55.730
What are we doing
back here?

39:55.842 --> 39:57.810
It's part of the plan.
Just stay low.

40:23.603 --> 40:26.629
Hi, Frannie.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you.
Can I talk to you and Walt?

40:26.773 --> 40:28.240
He's not here.
What do you want?

40:28.474 --> 40:30.908
Well, I have to talk to you
about that TV interview.

40:31.010 --> 40:34.878
You said you saw
that little bear on the floor
after the kidnapping.

40:34.948 --> 40:37.439
Who cares?
I don't have my baby.

40:37.517 --> 40:38.643
Just leave me alone.

40:38.718 --> 40:40.948
Wait a minute.
Please, please.
Now, this is important.

40:41.788 --> 40:42.880
Did you really
see the bear?

40:42.956 --> 40:43.945
Yes.

40:44.023 --> 40:45.684
Have you seen
the bear recently?

40:45.892 --> 40:47.086
No.

40:47.827 --> 40:50.091
So it was here when
little Garwood was kidnapped,

40:50.163 --> 40:51.596
but turned up missing later.

40:52.398 --> 40:55.162
Look, get out of here
before I call the police.

40:55.234 --> 40:58.567
Frannie, come on, you're gonna
have to help me if you want me
to find your son.

41:00.473 --> 41:03.909
Now, did Garwood Jr. Ever
talk to you about the money
his father buried?

41:04.611 --> 41:06.977
Well, sure.
I mean, as a joke.

41:07.046 --> 41:09.139
He said it would be
little Garwood's inheritance.

41:10.016 --> 41:11.608
Some inheritance.

41:12.285 --> 41:13.616
Did Walt know about this?

41:14.087 --> 41:15.452
I guess so.

41:16.322 --> 41:18.119
Oh, please, I'm tired

41:18.191 --> 41:19.783
and I'm scared.

41:21.094 --> 41:23.562
Take Garwood back
to prison before someone
shoots him, huh?

41:23.630 --> 41:25.097
Where's Walt?

41:25.465 --> 41:26.523
What's he got to do with it?

41:26.599 --> 41:28.328
Look, you said
the bear was left here.

41:28.401 --> 41:30.301
Little Garwood would've
gone crazy without it.

41:30.370 --> 41:32.031
Somebody had
to bring it to him.

41:33.206 --> 41:34.434
Walt?

41:35.441 --> 41:36.840
Where is he?

41:38.611 --> 41:41.171
He plays gin every Wednesday
with his buddy Norm.

41:41.514 --> 41:42.845
He said he had to get
out of the house,

41:42.915 --> 41:45.577
that the...
Waiting was...

41:46.986 --> 41:48.476
Where's Norm live?

42:12.178 --> 42:14.271
I can't believe you didn't
bring your gun with you.

42:14.647 --> 42:17.411
What kind of detectives
are they turning out
these days?

42:17.550 --> 42:19.814
I don't like using guns
any more than you do,
Garwood.

42:19.886 --> 42:22.684
Besides, I don't want to
risk any shooting
if your grandson's in there.

42:22.755 --> 42:23.744
Yeah.

42:28.294 --> 42:30.228
I can't understand it.
The sucker won't eat.

42:30.763 --> 42:32.663
Well, maybe it's that stuff
you're trying to feed him.

42:32.965 --> 42:34.227
It looks like slime.

42:34.634 --> 42:36.829
Yeah. Just get rid
of that gun, huh?

42:36.936 --> 42:38.198
I don't want any more trouble.

42:38.371 --> 42:40.100
You told me
to scare the PI away.

42:40.173 --> 42:42.437
How was I supposed
to know some old guy
would get in the way?

42:42.575 --> 42:44.736
Come on, Gar.
Eat them up.
- No.

42:44.811 --> 42:46.608
It's little Garwood.
Shh!

42:46.679 --> 42:47.737
I'm going in.

42:47.814 --> 42:50.146
We're not going
anywhere till we find out
what we're up against.

42:51.384 --> 42:55.718
Come on, now.
Let's open the airport
hangar wide, Gar,

42:55.788 --> 42:57.551
and I'll fly right in.

42:57.623 --> 42:58.612
No.

42:58.691 --> 42:59.919
Come on, Gar.

43:01.661 --> 43:03.185
That's a boy.

43:03.262 --> 43:04.286
What are you waiting for?

43:04.363 --> 43:05.694
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.

43:06.466 --> 43:07.831
There you go.
That's good.

43:07.900 --> 43:09.026
I'll get him some milk.

43:12.004 --> 43:13.665
What's the difference?

43:13.873 --> 43:16.273
By tomorrow morning,
we either turn him over
for the money,

43:16.342 --> 43:18.139
or we sell him
to them baby brokers.

43:18.211 --> 43:19.644
We're not selling him!

43:20.046 --> 43:22.446
I just know his grandfather's
gonna come through
with them money.

43:23.583 --> 43:25.676
Okay, here's the plan.

43:27.086 --> 43:29.316
You no-good, sorry excuse...

43:29.822 --> 43:31.722
Garwood, you're early!

43:32.759 --> 43:35.250
Don't you ever do
what you're told?
Stay with your grandson.

43:36.662 --> 43:38.186
You all right?

43:38.364 --> 43:40.127
Give granddaddy five.

43:40.233 --> 43:42.201
Attaboy!
Give me five more.

43:43.970 --> 43:45.460
Come on, let's go.

43:51.778 --> 43:53.109
High five.

44:17.570 --> 44:19.094
Patchismo.

44:43.663 --> 44:45.597
Before I blow you
to perdition, boy,

44:45.665 --> 44:47.292
I wanna know why.

44:47.667 --> 44:49.191
You're joking.

44:50.102 --> 44:51.763
All right, all right.
I'll tell you why.

44:51.838 --> 44:53.203
Because I couldn't lose.

44:53.506 --> 44:55.599
Norm was gonna
pick up the money,
we would have split it,

44:55.675 --> 44:58.109
and then you would've brought
little Garwood back to me
and his mom.

44:58.177 --> 44:59.906
That doesn't answer
my question, boy.

45:00.313 --> 45:02.781
Because I'm tired of selling
that Patcrap stuff!

45:03.115 --> 45:06.107
You try going door to door
every day and having them
slammed in your face!

45:06.185 --> 45:09.643
Go ahead, Garwood,
you try it. You never had
a regular job in your life.

45:10.022 --> 45:11.319
Now, get out of my way

45:11.390 --> 45:13.415
or I'm gonna knock
your head all the way
into the cheap seats.

45:13.492 --> 45:14.823
I wouldn't try it, Walt.

45:14.894 --> 45:17.795
Take it from me, boy.
Crime doesn't pay.
Yeah, maybe.

45:18.197 --> 45:19.789
But I'm getting out of here,
Garwood, right now,

45:19.866 --> 45:21.697
because I know damned well
you're not gonna shoot me.

45:21.767 --> 45:22.825
You don't have it in you.

45:22.902 --> 45:24.130
I wouldn't bet on it.

45:24.971 --> 45:28.407
You better put
that bat down, Walt.
I think he's serious.

45:29.508 --> 45:32.602
Garwood? He never shot
a real gun in his life!

45:39.285 --> 45:40.616
Good shot.

45:41.287 --> 45:43.881
Well, hell,
I was aiming at his chest.

45:48.661 --> 45:51.095
Would you mind
standing downwind?

46:04.110 --> 46:06.908
Listen, you wanna trade
that truck for this bear?

46:09.048 --> 46:10.777
Attaboy!

46:13.519 --> 46:16.920
How can you possibly eat
with that odor reeking
from your body?

46:17.056 --> 46:19.047
Higgins, what do you
want from me?

46:19.125 --> 46:21.093
I've already
taken six baths.

46:21.294 --> 46:23.421
My skin is starting to peel.

46:23.796 --> 46:25.423
The smell will
go away sometime.

46:25.498 --> 46:27.295
Perhaps if you
buried yourself.

46:27.633 --> 46:29.760
Hey, come on, fellas,
let's don't argue.

46:29.835 --> 46:31.735
We got a nice family picnic
going here.

46:31.938 --> 46:33.098
Quite.

46:33.339 --> 46:35.899
You know, I think
things are gonna
work out pretty good.

46:35.975 --> 46:37.704
I've got my grandson back.

46:37.777 --> 46:39.267
Maybe even my son.

46:39.345 --> 46:42.781
And it could be that I got
little Garwood his parents
back together again.

46:42.848 --> 46:44.543
Yeah. It's too bad
about the money, though.

46:45.518 --> 46:47.042
Money doesn't matter.

46:47.119 --> 46:49.485
That thing never brought me
anything but trouble,
you know that?

46:49.555 --> 46:51.785
I'm gonna give my grandson
a lot better legacy.

46:52.892 --> 46:54.223
Son.

46:57.596 --> 46:58.893
There's your boy.

46:59.598 --> 47:01.259
Come on.
Here's your truck.

47:06.572 --> 47:09.769
You know,
I think he's gonna
straighten out.

47:10.743 --> 47:12.768
Well, you got
some time together now.

47:12.845 --> 47:14.972
I think he's on
the right track already.

47:15.147 --> 47:16.739
No need to get sentimental.

47:17.283 --> 47:20.343
But I feel good.
Got my family,
got my friends.

47:20.586 --> 47:22.213
Right back here
where I belong.

47:22.488 --> 47:23.887
Home sweet home.

47:24.090 --> 47:26.024
Come on, Magnum,
let me show you around.

47:27.927 --> 47:29.724
Come on, <i>el</i> Higgo,
old buddy.

47:33.199 --> 47:34.598
That guy's Sam.

47:34.767 --> 47:36.428
Hi, Elmo.
Elmo's the dog.
