is called Bubble Gum Pink,

11:35.433 --> 11:38.067
and this one is
Fee Fi Fo Plum.

11:39.067 --> 11:41.100
- Babe, which one do you like?

11:41.167 --> 11:43.833
- Yeah, totally.
- Cool.

11:45.533 --> 11:48.633
- Uh Peggy, if you like
both those colors,

11:48.700 --> 11:50.900
maybe Bunny could do
a checkerboard pattern.

11:50.967 --> 11:53.867
- Sure I could,
for an extra ten bucks.

11:53.933 --> 11:57.233
- Oh. I thought that since
it's my birthday,

11:57.300 --> 12:00.100
this manicure was free.

12:00.167 --> 12:04.400
- Oh no, no.
You're payin' for this.

12:04.467 --> 12:07.733
- When I was in fifth grade,
I won a spelling bee.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.867
- Spelling's cool.

12:09.933 --> 12:12.567
- Yeah, I can spell
almost any word.

12:12.633 --> 12:14.833
Like... "ascertain".

12:16.333 --> 12:18.733
- Do it.
- Okay!

12:18.800 --> 12:23.367
A... S... C...

12:23.433 --> 12:27.167
- Ruthless, can I...

12:27.233 --> 12:28.967
talk to you for a sec?

12:29.067 --> 12:30.200
- Okay!

12:35.500 --> 12:37.500
- What's up?
- Shhhh.

12:37.567 --> 12:44.567
See... I'd kinda like to talk
to Mason, you know, alone.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.167
- Oh, you got a crush on Mason?
- Shhhhh!

12:49.233 --> 12:53.300
- Hi, sorry it took so long.
Here you go, Ruthless .

12:53.367 --> 12:55.267
- Thanks.
- Look Mom!

12:55.333 --> 12:57.733
Mr. Bunny's making
my nails look so neat.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.667
- Ohh, see baby?
Life isn't only about pain.

13:05.667 --> 13:08.067
- Hey, when do the other
girls get here?

13:09.533 --> 13:13.200
- Yeah Peggy, don't you have
any other friends?

13:15.133 --> 13:16.267
- No.

13:16.333 --> 13:18.667
- That's sad!

13:18.733 --> 13:23.767
- Uh... so Peggy tells me
that you guys have a hot tub.

13:23.833 --> 13:27.233
- Oh yeah, we do.
- And we have extra swim suits.

13:27.300 --> 13:30.367
- Well, okay, here's a little
plan off the top of my head.

13:30.433 --> 13:34.167
Bunny and Ruthless can leave...
and then, Kenzie,

13:34.233 --> 13:35.733
why don't you hang out
with Peggy, you know,

13:35.800 --> 13:37.200
talk about all those cool
vegetables...

13:37.267 --> 13:40.733
and Mrs. Kendal, you look tired,
so you should go to bed,

13:40.800 --> 13:42.467
and then I'll get
in the hot tub by myself--

13:42.533 --> 13:43.800
oh wait I forgot
about Mason.

13:43.867 --> 13:46.267
Hey, Mason wanna come
hang out with me?

13:47.567 --> 13:49.333
- We don't have to go anywhere.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.700
- Yeah! Our night's wide open.

13:53.067 --> 13:58.833
- Yeah, but... cuz... I just...
in the hot tub...

14:02.967 --> 14:04.767
- Guess there's no more room.

14:04.833 --> 14:07.633
- There can be! Get out.

14:07.700 --> 14:10.067
- But I like it in here.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.300
- I'm gonna go work
on my motorcycle.

14:12.367 --> 14:15.633
- But...awww.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.167
- Who wants to play
Marco Polo?

14:18.233 --> 14:20.100
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:20.167 --> 14:23.433
- Marco!

14:23.500 --> 14:27.200
- Polo!

14:27.267 --> 14:29.833
- It doesn't work
in a hot tub!

14:47.733 --> 14:50.100
- I thought you said we were
gonna fly in your helicopter,

14:50.167 --> 14:53.333
to the Hamptons, and eat
in a fancy restaurant.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.700
- Look, I only said all that
stuff about the Hamptons

14:55.767 --> 14:58.700
and my helicopter
to make Trip jealous.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.933
- One time I swallowed
a screwdriver.

15:06.067 --> 15:08.167
- Check please!

15:10.633 --> 15:13.733
- Okay, chlorine!

15:13.800 --> 15:18.667
- Chlorine. C... H... L...

15:18.733 --> 15:20.600
- Ah!

15:20.667 --> 15:23.367
- Okay, I have a question.

15:23.433 --> 15:26.700
Uh... where's Mason working
on his motorcycle?

15:26.767 --> 15:28.733
- He's probably in the garage.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.533
- The garage.

15:31.867 --> 15:34.400
Interesting.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.567
- What's "interesting"
about a garage?

15:36.633 --> 15:40.700
- Well... remember how I told
you how my mom's thinking about

15:40.767 --> 15:42.167
re-doing our garage?

15:42.233 --> 15:44.333
- I don't think
you ever told me that.

15:44.400 --> 15:48.533
- Well we're thinking
about it.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.633
Mind if I go see yours?

15:50.700 --> 15:52.233
Sure, but you might
run into Mason.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.233
- Ohhh, if I do
I'll deal with it.

15:54.300 --> 15:55.900
- Okay.

15:58.233 --> 16:01.633
- Hey, will you bring me
back a sparkling water?

16:01.700 --> 16:04.233
- Yeah sure.

16:04.300 --> 16:05.700
- I'll have a diet root beer.

16:05.767 --> 16:07.400
- I'll take a coconut water.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.067
- Can you bring me
a bell pepper?

16:09.100 --> 16:10.967
- Anything else?
- Yeah,

16:11.067 --> 16:12.833
drag out the rest
of that birthday cake.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.267
- Oh yeah.

16:14.333 --> 16:18.600
- Good idea.
- I like that.

16:18.667 --> 16:21.067
- Oh hi Mason.
- Mason?

16:21.100 --> 16:22.600
We thought
you were in the garage.

16:22.667 --> 16:27.933
- Hey... we're all everywhere...
and nowhere.

16:28.067 --> 16:30.967
- That's kinda true.
- That's deep.

16:31.067 --> 16:32.933
- Well, Babe got out,
I think

16:33.067 --> 16:34.600
there's room in here
for you now.

16:34.667 --> 16:36.400
- Here I come.

16:36.467 --> 16:38.700
- We can move over.
- Slide on in.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.867
- There you go.
- Okay, be careful.

16:40.933 --> 16:44.333
- He's handsome.
- Thank you.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.667
- Hey, I have a fun idea.
- What is it?

16:46.733 --> 16:50.567
- Let's do a beat-box jam.
- Ooo yeah, let's do that!

16:50.633 --> 16:51.600
- That sounds fun.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.967
- Okay. Here I go...

16:54.067 --> 16:56.200
( beat box sounds )

17:11.700 --> 17:14.100
- Hey!

17:14.167 --> 17:17.100
- Wh-When did Mason get
in the hot tub?!?

17:17.167 --> 17:18.433
- While you were inside.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.133
- Did you bring
my diet root beer?

17:20.200 --> 17:22.100
'Cuz I haven't had anything
to drink--

17:24.800 --> 17:27.600
- Dang, that girl can throw.

17:27.667 --> 17:30.067
- Yeah, and here's
the rest of your stuff.

17:31.167 --> 17:32.500
- Anyone see
my coconut water?

17:32.567 --> 17:34.800
- Where's my bell pepper?
- Why she do that?

17:34.867 --> 17:37.400
- This cake got all wet.

17:47.333 --> 17:53.467
- ( laughing )
Hudson, you crack me up.

17:55.667 --> 17:59.167
- So... sounds like you
guys had a lotta fun.

17:59.233 --> 18:00.900
- Oh yeah, we got on it.

18:00.967 --> 18:02.833
Took the helicopter
to the Hamptons,

18:02.900 --> 18:06.333
had dinner at Vaccaro's...
oh, and check out the wrist.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.067
Boom.

18:08.100 --> 18:12.233
- You got him a Yublo?
- Oh, did I?

18:12.300 --> 18:14.433
- You know I wanted a watch
like this!

18:14.500 --> 18:16.533
- Aw, nah, I thought
you wanted a gold one.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.667
- It is gold!

18:17.733 --> 18:20.067
- No, this is gold
with diamonds.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.967
- D'awwwww!

18:24.500 --> 18:28.133
- Okay, I'm sorry,
but I have to stop this.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.067
- Stop what?
- Whatcha talking about, Hudson?

18:31.100 --> 18:35.433
- Trip, your dad did not take
me to the Hamptons tonight.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.067
- Shhhh shhhhh!

18:37.100 --> 18:39.067
- We just took a cab to Fooders.

18:39.133 --> 18:41.500
I had spaghetti,
and he had skirt steak,

18:41.567 --> 18:45.133
which I thought
was just for ladies,

18:45.200 --> 18:48.767
but I guess it's not
gender-specific.

18:48.833 --> 18:50.367
Anyway, you shouldn't be mad.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.567
The only reason your dad took me
out was to make you jealous.

18:53.633 --> 18:57.467
'Cuz you hurt his feelings
when you canceled on him.

19:01.233 --> 19:02.733
- Is that true?

19:02.800 --> 19:04.467
- I mean, you know,
it hurt a little bit,

19:04.533 --> 19:05.633
but I'm cool.

19:09.567 --> 19:14.933
- Hey dad...it's not that late.
What do you say

19:15.067 --> 19:18.133
me and you go get some
frozen yogurt or something...

19:18.200 --> 19:19.867
just hang out, the two of us.

19:19.933 --> 19:22.267
- Yeah, that...that'd be cool.

19:22.333 --> 19:25.433
Go get your jacket.
- Yes, sir.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.367
- My son.

19:31.067 --> 19:35.400
- Ha ha ha! Hey Gabrielle.
What's goin' on?

19:36.633 --> 19:38.300
Oh, you're lonely?

19:38.367 --> 19:40.400
Oh, no, we can't
have that, girl.

19:40.467 --> 19:43.233
Oh yeah! I can be over there
in thirty minutes.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.867
Oh yeah, you know
I'm gonna bring that,

19:44.933 --> 19:46.767
ain't nothing wrong with that.

19:46.833 --> 19:50.267
Ahhh! Ahhhh!
Oh, Jack! Jack!

19:50.333 --> 19:53.067
I'll be there in a second, Jack!
Hold on, Jack!

19:53.100 --> 19:54.533
- What's happened?

19:54.600 --> 19:56.300
- Oh, my friend Jack,
he got hit by...

19:56.367 --> 19:59.300
uh... a truck. Yeah.
- Oh man!

19:59.367 --> 20:00.300
- No way!
- Yeah, it's horrible.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.900
I gotta to the hospital,

20:01.967 --> 20:04.433
so I'm gonna be
on my way, okay?

20:04.500 --> 20:06.967
- Yeah, yeah, sure, no worries,
go ahead and see Jack.

20:07.033 --> 20:09.700
- Cool. Bye son.
Bye goofball.

20:10.833 --> 20:12.567
- Have fun with Gabrielle!

20:15.400 --> 20:18.000
- Yeah, I kinda knew.

20:18.067 --> 20:19.633
- But it's... Gabrielle...

20:19.700 --> 20:21.067
- Uh-huh.

20:21.133 --> 20:22.433

20:26.300 --> 20:30.067
- He's right again.
- Thank you, thank you.

20:30.133 --> 20:33.800
- Hey, what's wrong with Babe?

20:33.867 --> 20:37.900
- Oh. I think she's sad 'cuz she
really wanted to sit in here,

20:37.967 --> 20:39.933
y'know, next to...

20:40.000 --> 20:42.300
- Oh...
Hey, Ruthless.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.733
Hey uh... Ruthless and I
are late for somethin',

20:50.800 --> 20:52.267
so we're gonna head on out.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.867
- Yeah, we're leaving.

20:53.933 --> 20:56.800
- Oh nooooo.
- We've got to.

21:04.433 --> 21:08.467
- Hey Babe! There's room for you
in the hot tub.

21:09.867 --> 21:11.700
- Oh. Well, okay!

21:13.133 --> 21:14.533
Here I come.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.667
- So, where are
you guys going?

21:18.733 --> 21:21.333
- Oh, we're gonna check out the
monster truck derby, in Queens.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.200

truck derby?

21:23.267 --> 21:25.833
- Yeah.
- You wanna come with us?

21:25.900 --> 21:27.433
