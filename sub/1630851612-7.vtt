- What's up, guys?

01:18.646 --> 01:20.779
Now, four alter egos
will compete tonight,

01:20.915 --> 01:23.482
but only two will advance
to the semi-finals.

01:23.551 --> 01:26.785
The other two will
have to say goodbye,
but before they go,

01:26.921 --> 01:29.655
they'll reveal their true
identities to the judges.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.623
So, in our
head-to-heads tonight,

01:31.759 --> 01:34.460
we have fern versus misty rose.

01:34.595 --> 01:38.897
Okay. Okay, okay.

01:39.033 --> 01:41.967
And we have wolfgang champagne

01:42.036 --> 01:45.070
versus the loverboy.

01:45.206 --> 01:48.107
So what are the factors
that determine which one

01:48.242 --> 01:49.908
you're sending
to the semi-finals?

01:50.044 --> 01:54.179
I'm looking for whoever becomes
this next digital superstar,

01:54.315 --> 01:58.083
are they going to be using
this platform in a way
where they can influence

01:58.152 --> 02:00.886
millions of people
listening to them?

02:00.955 --> 02:03.989
I don't think you get
what the hell's coming
around the corner.

02:04.058 --> 02:05.090
It's freaking awesome.

02:06.827 --> 02:11.130
So I think we're
looking for that undefined
magical component.

02:11.265 --> 02:14.066
The best artist
that ever walked the earth.

02:14.201 --> 02:16.301
All right, let's meet our first
head-to-head contenders,

02:16.437 --> 02:19.605
wolfgang champagne
and the loverboy.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.644
Wolfgang champagne

02:25.713 --> 02:28.347
<i>This is a match-up that's all</i>

02:28.415 --> 02:32.117
Is it okay to have
a crush on alter ego?

02:32.186 --> 02:33.852
Aww, yeah.

02:33.988 --> 02:36.388
<i> Wolfgang champagne kept us</i>
<i> on our toes with his wit.</i>

02:36.457 --> 02:37.756
First round's on me.

02:37.825 --> 02:41.026
It's got to be.
I ain't got no prize money yet.

02:41.095 --> 02:44.429
But the loverboy gave us
rock star level stage presence.

02:44.565 --> 02:48.567
♪ oh, oh, living on a prayer

02:48.636 --> 02:53.238
the alter ego that blends
personality with performance
will come out on top here.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.747
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

03:08.155 --> 03:11.823
I love you will.I.Am,
alanis morissette,
grimes, and mike.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.627
- How you doing, mike?
- Thank you, wolfy.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.663
Do you guys hang out when you're
not rehearing and performing?

03:17.731 --> 03:19.398
Do you guys hang out backstage?
Are you friends?

03:19.466 --> 03:21.133
I mean, we started
off as friends.

03:21.268 --> 03:24.269
Yeah, not anymore
now that we're competing.

03:24.405 --> 03:28.106
So, loverboy, is there anything
about today's friendship
turned competition

03:28.242 --> 03:30.943
that is scaring you
or you're excited about today?

03:31.078 --> 03:35.347
- Why you looking
at me like that, brah?
- I'm just looking at you.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.150
- You're answering
the question, man.
- Listen, I'll say this.

03:38.219 --> 03:42.321
I couldn't find
a better opponent.
This man's voice is beautiful.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.390
He smells like a dog,
but he sings like an angel.

03:47.428 --> 03:51.830
- I also relate to that.
- I'll take that.
It's all right.

03:51.899 --> 03:55.400
Well, wolfy, you're up first.
Let's see what you got.

03:55.469 --> 03:58.670
- All right.
- Come on, wolfy!
Show it to us.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.612
Well, it made me feel great that
the judges and the audience

04:06.747 --> 04:08.981
and everybody started
cheering "wolfy, wolfy."

04:09.049 --> 04:12.017
that was one of the weirdest
things I've ever seen.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.286
- Thank you.
- And that's a compliment.

04:14.421 --> 04:18.991
I'm pinching myself.
Can't feel it because I'm old,
but I'm pinching myself.

04:19.059 --> 04:22.461
I had no expectation of
being on the show,
because I'm 60,

04:22.596 --> 04:25.063
and I have
way less in front of me
than I have behind me.

04:25.199 --> 04:28.634
But being an alter ego
makes me marketable

04:28.702 --> 04:30.535
and relevant
to all age groups.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.471
And that's the beauty
of this show.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.273
<i> ♪ change your ways </i>

04:34.341 --> 04:36.708
in this round,
wolfgang champagne,

04:36.777 --> 04:39.945
will be going against
the loverboy.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.348
His first name is the.
His last name is loverboy.

04:43.417 --> 04:47.619
You could not get more opposite
than wolfgang champagne
and loverboy.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.788
- I'm weirdly attracted to you.
- You ain't never going to get
a bite of this, brother.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.189
- That's all I'm saying.
- Unh-uh.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.325
But our voices
are completely different.

04:53.394 --> 04:56.828
If I tried to sing like
loverboy, I'd lose my voice
in about 30 seconds.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.631
So I think it'll just come down
to what style they prefer,

04:59.767 --> 05:02.768
because I don't even know
how you will judge us
against each other.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.470
- Oh.
- It's all right.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.372
- I thought you
were stretching.
- No.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.009
Do you guys have
a favorite going in?

05:11.145 --> 05:13.779
I'm more curious to see
what wolfy, like--

05:13.914 --> 05:16.915
it is so specifically
operatic the first time.

05:16.984 --> 05:20.619
- If wool-effy
comes out with a...
- Wool-effy.

05:20.688 --> 05:24.623
...Something in a different
genre and aces it,

07:31.418 --> 07:34.619
Wolfy, the audience
is going crazy for you

07:34.721 --> 07:36.955
and they were crazy for you
in the audition round.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.059
How does this crowd
feel to you tonight?

07:41.128 --> 07:43.495
( chanting )
wolfy! Wolfy! Wolfy!

07:43.630 --> 07:45.464
Yeah! That's music
to my ears right there.

07:45.532 --> 07:49.901
You're the best looking crowd
I've ever seen in my 540 years!

07:50.037 --> 07:52.471
You're so pretty.

07:52.539 --> 07:55.307
What did you guys think
of wolfgang champagne?

07:55.375 --> 07:57.943
- Grimes?
- You are the most,
sort of like,

07:58.078 --> 08:03.014
surrealist, absurdist
performer that we have.

08:03.083 --> 08:06.284
Don't really
know how to take that,
but I'll take absurd.

08:06.420 --> 08:08.820
Better than ugly.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.389
I actually feel like it's time
to bring back to the opera.

08:11.458 --> 08:14.025
- Let's do pop-era.
How do you like that?
- Pop-era.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.696
- Yeah.
- I think you just did pop-era.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.498
Pop-era.
That's what I want to be.

08:19.633 --> 08:23.301
Let's talk about
your pop-era, wolfy.

08:23.370 --> 08:26.104
First of all, as much as
I enjoyed hearing you sing
in a foreign language

08:26.240 --> 08:30.976
in the audition rounds,
I enjoyed hearing you sing
n english that much more.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.978
I thought you felt completely
at ease in that performance.

08:33.113 --> 08:37.382
I love-- you did a little flip
to falsetto, which I think
showed chops and your range.

08:37.518 --> 08:40.385
And what I like about your
performance the most is that,

08:40.487 --> 08:43.788
it fits totally--
to me, it fits your alter ego.

08:43.857 --> 08:49.027
What we're looking for
is a combination of voice,
movement, charm,

08:49.096 --> 08:51.196
how integrated you are
with your alter ego.

08:51.265 --> 08:54.132
Do we believe you at face value?
You have all that.

08:54.268 --> 08:55.800
Rocsi: Will.I.Am?

08:55.869 --> 09:01.439
I like wolfy's fearlessness
to reimagine and claim.

09:01.575 --> 09:05.844
Right? So wolfy's coming out
with a steampunk goth vibe,

09:05.979 --> 09:10.982
but at the same time
giving you slapstick comedy,

09:11.051 --> 09:14.986
but then singing
amazing opera.

09:15.055 --> 09:18.123
Your favorite singers,
you just don't go to their show

09:18.258 --> 09:20.125
and they just sing songs
and that's it.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.861
You might as well stay on
tiktok and youtube.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.297
That's the banter
in between the songs.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.699
That's the imagination
to take the song left and right.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.302
Wolfy has all those skill sets,

09:30.370 --> 09:31.937
and I acknowledge that
and I salute that,

09:32.072 --> 09:33.705
and I love wolfy.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.908
That is high praise indeed,
my friend, from you.

09:36.977 --> 09:41.646
I don't even know what
tiktok and youtube is.
I'm sorry. I'm old.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.315
Guys, you're trying
to teach wolfy,

09:43.383 --> 09:45.917
but you got to know
you can't teach
an old dog new tricks.

09:45.986 --> 09:50.221
- Oh! Oh, you didn't!
- That's a dad joke.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.823
- Wolfy: Yeah!
- Rocsi: Watch out, guys.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.458
Nick's starting
on his dad jokes.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.827
So before he goes any further,

09:55.896 --> 09:58.830
when we come back,
the loverboy will perform,

09:58.899 --> 10:03.101
and the judges will decide
who they'll put on the diamond

10:03.236 --> 10:05.103
- and into the semi-finals.
- Wolfy!

10:05.238 --> 10:07.772
There's only room for one
alter ego in the next round.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.941
The other will have to go home,
but not before

10:10.077 --> 10:12.644
revealing who
they really are to the judges.

We're about to find out
which alter ego is moving on
to our semi-finals.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.282
You both are going
to be huge stars.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.552

Wolfgang champagne
came to win tonight,

11:11.271 --> 11:14.506
but will he win a spot
in the semi-finals?

11:14.641 --> 11:17.275
Well, his opponent is not
going down without a fight.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.310
It's the loverboy.

11:21.081 --> 11:24.115
I need an alter ego
to give me the freedom

11:24.184 --> 11:27.585
to just focus
on what really matters,
and that's my voice.

11:27.654 --> 11:30.789
The loverboy allows me to
tap into my inner rock star.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.124
Looks like he plays
for aerosmith.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.427
I got a free spirit,
and the loverboy helped me
bring that out.

11:37.464 --> 11:41.032
We're moving forward in
technology. You looking at
a superhero on stage.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.967
An intergalactic rock star.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.603
Man, I just
can't believe there's
somebody backstage singing.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.072
- Amazing. Amazing.
- That's just crazy.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.441
Being in the bottom two
next to kai

11:49.509 --> 11:50.942
was a lot of pressure.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.877
We all just loved
the tone of your voice,

11:52.946 --> 11:55.747
and so we're going to
save the loverboy.

11:55.882 --> 11:59.284
Loverboy and I are both coming
into our own right now.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.953
I have never sang songs
like these before.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.621
I'm so far out
of my comfort zone,

12:03.690 --> 12:06.257
and it's pushing
a level of growth that
I wasn't even expecting.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.660
- Yeah, and I owe that
to the loverboy.
- Hey!

12:08.795 --> 12:11.463

As long as I got the air behind
my lungs to get these notes,

12:15.869 --> 12:17.335
then I'll be all right
for this song.

12:34.855 --> 12:38.790
♪ baby, can't you see

12:38.859 --> 12:42.427

14:00.106 --> 14:03.508
- yeah!
- Rocsi: The loverboy!

14:03.577 --> 14:06.277
They're loving you right now.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.948
Now I know you're all
about love, but we're about
to find out from the judges

14:10.016 --> 14:12.951
if they loved your performance.
You ready for this?

14:13.019 --> 14:16.087
- Oh, yeah. I'm ready.
- All right, grimes, what did
you think of his performance?

14:16.223 --> 14:19.257
I do think it was one of
the weakest vocal performances

14:19.392 --> 14:20.458
I've seen in the competition,

14:20.594 --> 14:22.794
but from a pure
popstar perspective,

14:22.863 --> 14:24.095
that was extremely strong.

14:24.231 --> 14:25.797
And what we might
consider mistakes,

14:25.866 --> 14:28.266
I think made it seem more
realistic and natural.

14:28.335 --> 14:31.102
And what matters now
is creative decisions
that are interesting.

14:31.238 --> 14:35.440
So I think you actually did
bring one of the best creative
decisions of the competition.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.476
Thank you.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.979
Nick what did you think
of his performance?

14:41.114 --> 14:45.583
I agree with grimes
that the approach to the song
was really creative.

14:45.719 --> 14:49.954
Where I disagree with grimes
is I do care about
the vocal performance,

14:50.023 --> 14:51.923
and I felt like
unfortunately for me,

14:51.992 --> 14:53.958
he wasn't as confident
with his vocal

14:54.027 --> 14:55.894
- as I wanted him to be,
if that makes sense.
- It was safe.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.629
- Yeah.
- And key is a big part of that.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.898
If it's in the wrong key
and you're not comfortable

15:00.033 --> 15:01.733
with where it sits
in your vocal range,

15:01.868 --> 15:04.736
you're not going to
step out there confidently
and comfortably

15:04.871 --> 15:06.304
and deliver the performance
you're capable of delivering.

15:06.373 --> 15:09.107
Can we try in this moment
shifting the key

15:09.175 --> 15:11.676
and just experimenting
with some of the verses
a little higher up?

15:11.745 --> 15:12.944
Yeah, come on.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.714
♪ baby, can't you see

15:16.783 --> 15:19.417
♪ baby, can't you see

15:19.552 --> 15:22.754
- one more.
- ♪ baby, can't you see

15:22.822 --> 15:25.790
♪ I'm calling?

15:25.859 --> 15:29.227
♪ someone like you
should wear a warning ♪

15:29.296 --> 15:34.265
♪ you're dangerous,
I'm falling ♪

15:34.367 --> 15:37.402
♪ ahh,
with a taste of your lips ♪

15:37.470 --> 15:40.271
♪ I'm on a ride

15:40.340 --> 15:43.741
♪ you're toxic,

15:43.877 --> 15:47.278
♪ taste of a poison paradise

15:47.347 --> 15:51.282
♪ I'm addicted to you,
don't you know that

15:51.351 --> 15:54.152
- whoo!
- Hey!

15:54.254 --> 15:55.586
Whoo!

15:55.722 --> 15:59.357
The loverboy, that was hot.
Just saying.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.992
- It hits that sweet spot.
- Right.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.962
- Yeah, I think you're right.
- That was freaking amazing.

16:04.097 --> 16:08.566
An avatar ad-libbing adjustments
right there like that.

16:08.702 --> 16:11.903
So applaud the freaking
technicians in the back.

16:12.038 --> 16:15.273
- Applaud loverboy.
- Thank you so much.

16:15.342 --> 16:16.774
That means the world to me.
Thank you.

16:16.910 --> 16:18.743
Everything we're seeing now
out of loverboy

16:18.878 --> 16:20.945
and what we just heard
out of loverboy,

16:21.014 --> 16:23.982
I just wish we had seen
and heard that
in the performance.

16:24.117 --> 16:28.086
- Yes, sir.
- We've now seen two
phenomenal performances

16:28.221 --> 16:31.089
by wolfgang champagne
and the loverboy,

16:31.224 --> 16:34.258
but there's only room
for one of them on the diamond

16:34.394 --> 16:35.760
and in the semi-finals.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.261
So who's it going to be?

16:37.397 --> 16:38.997
We're going to find out
who will move on

16:39.065 --> 16:41.065
and whose journey
ends here tonight,

16:41.201 --> 16:45.003
but not before they reveal their
true identity to the judges.

16:45.071 --> 16:47.939
We'll be right back
with more "alter ego,"
the head-to-heads.

16:48.074 --> 16:51.709
♪ hey, hey, hey

17:03.656 --> 17:07.258
welcome back.
You're watching "alter ego."
I am rocsi diaz.

17:07.327 --> 17:11.262
We've seen performances
from both of these alter egos
in the head-to-heads,

17:11.331 --> 17:12.897
and now we're about to find out

17:13.033 --> 17:15.967
which one is moving on
to our semi-finals

17:16.102 --> 17:18.469
and which one will have
to go home tonight.

17:18.538 --> 17:22.740
Judges, I am so glad
I'm not in your shoes.

17:22.776 --> 17:24.942
It's time to make your decision.

17:28.581 --> 17:32.617
Who are you sending
through to the semi-finals
and who are you sending home?

17:32.752 --> 17:34.585
Grimes?

17:34.654 --> 17:36.988
Okay, well, I'm going
to start with loverboy.

17:37.057 --> 17:41.259
I think your decision
to do a gothy "toxic"
was just awesome,

17:41.394 --> 17:43.227
and I want to
commend you on that.

17:43.263 --> 17:48.099
And, wolfy, I can't really see
your face on a t-shirt,

17:48.234 --> 17:50.234
but that's kind of
what I like about it,

17:50.303 --> 17:52.837
is that it doesn't fit into
anything I've ever seen before.

17:52.906 --> 17:57.308
And that's kind of why I'm here,
so I'm going to save wolfy.

18:03.650 --> 18:07.018
That is one vote
for wolfy to move ahead.

18:07.087 --> 18:12.123
Will, which one of these
performers do you think is ready
for the semi-finals?

18:12.258 --> 18:14.058
So, first
I'll start with loverboy.

18:14.194 --> 18:19.564
So I think your show today
was an amazing idea,

18:19.699 --> 18:22.233
but executed comfortably,

18:22.302 --> 18:24.902
and that's
a dangerous combination.

18:25.038 --> 18:28.339
Because you should
always put yourself in
an uncomfortable scenario,

18:28.408 --> 18:29.607
'cause that'll push you,

18:29.742 --> 18:32.410
catapult you into awesomeness.

18:32.545 --> 18:36.214
Wolfy, dang.
You're really quick-witted.

18:36.349 --> 18:40.151
I would not expect
that quick wit to go with
that style of music.

18:40.220 --> 18:44.422
But the style of music,
does it fit in today's world?

18:44.557 --> 18:46.891
That's a hard one.

18:47.026 --> 18:51.429
The performance that
I'm going to put through was
not the singing performance,

18:51.498 --> 18:53.865
it was the connection
with the character,
and that's wolfy.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.934
Thank you.

18:59.739 --> 19:03.207
So right now that is
two votes for wolfy

19:03.343 --> 19:06.043
to go up on the diamond.

19:06.179 --> 19:10.248
- Alanis?
- I loved both of your voices--

19:10.383 --> 19:12.884
the pop-era goal for you, wolfy,

19:13.019 --> 19:16.254
and I loved the loverboy
when we were in a capella mode,

19:16.322 --> 19:17.889
and how you took it
to another level

19:18.024 --> 19:21.559
and I could see your charm
and your swagger emerge.

19:21.694 --> 19:25.163
I'm going to ask the loverboy
to stand up on that diamond.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.434
Nick: Wow.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.771
So wolfy has two votes
to go on up to the diamond.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.274
And the loverboy has one vote.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.744
Nick, you can either make this
a tie to go to the audience

19:39.812 --> 19:42.146
or you could decide
somebody's fate.

19:42.215 --> 19:46.117
Loverboy, what took me
a little bit out of
the performance

19:46.186 --> 19:52.089
was just the lack
of conviction in the vocal
during the performance.

19:52.225 --> 19:56.661
And I felt like wolfy's
performance tonight was more
confident, more convincing,

19:56.796 --> 20:00.831
and more what I'm looking for
to send on to the semi-finals.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.268
So I'm going to put wolfy
on the diamond.

20:06.839 --> 20:10.541
That is three votes for
wolfgang champagne.

20:10.677 --> 20:13.544
You have secured your spot
on that diamond.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.379
Congratulations.

20:15.515 --> 20:18.516
And you're headed off
into the semi-finals.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.721
Congratulations, wolfy.
We'll see you there.

20:23.790 --> 20:27.058
Unfortunately, the loverboy,

20:27.193 --> 20:30.995
that means that you are
going home tonight.

20:31.064 --> 20:36.067
But before you go,
we'd love to hear you
perform one more time

20:36.202 --> 20:41.072
- yeah.
- And reveal your human
self to the judges.

20:41.207 --> 20:43.007
- Let's do it.
- All right.

20:43.076 --> 20:46.944
Everyone, please,
a big round of applause
for the loverboy.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.146
- Yeah!

22:43.663 --> 22:48.999
So, I'd like to introduce
you guys to anthony,
aka the loverboy.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.268
Anthony, how are you feeling?

22:51.404 --> 22:54.672
Every part of this journey
has been right on time
for me, you know?

22:54.741 --> 22:57.708
I liked what you said.
You called it a journey,
and that's exactly what it is.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.310
And you're not at
your destination yet.

22:59.445 --> 23:01.112
- You know what I mean?
- That's a fact.

23:01.180 --> 23:04.215
What you just did
here on that last song,

23:04.350 --> 23:06.150
I felt something from you there.

23:06.219 --> 23:09.553
Oh, now you did?
That's great, bro. Thanks.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.956
Nah, nah, nah.
Thank you, though.
Thank you. Thank you.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.825
Yeah, you seem cooler
than your alter ego.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.728
I feel blessed.
This is such a unique
opportunity

23:17.864 --> 23:20.064
to be part of the way
that art is moving forward,

23:20.199 --> 23:22.066
where we're receiving art
differently.

23:22.135 --> 23:23.434
Nobody's ever done this before.

23:23.503 --> 23:27.004
So to be one of the first
to just embody this alien

23:27.073 --> 23:29.440
from outer space
singing his heart out,

23:29.509 --> 23:31.909
you know what I mean?
It's so unique.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.911
- I agree. I agree.
- This show gave me
the opportunity

23:33.980 --> 23:35.946
to just bring my music
to a new height.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.948
I'm excited to get
to the studio to be honest.

23:38.017 --> 23:41.652
- Whoo!
- You need a producer?

23:41.788 --> 23:43.621
Of course.
Are you kidding me?

23:43.756 --> 23:45.756
Work with a g.O.A.T.?
Yes, please.

23:45.825 --> 23:48.025
We should really
try to get in the studio.

23:48.161 --> 23:51.028
- Don't play with me, man.
- I'm not playing around.
For real.

23:51.164 --> 23:53.697
- Yeah.
- Dude, you're getting in
the studio with will.I.Am.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.567
I can't even get him
to follow me on instagram.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.570
Loverboy, anthony,
it's been a pleasure having
you on this show.

23:59.639 --> 24:02.206
- Thank you so much.
- Thank y'all so much
for having me.

24:02.341 --> 24:04.742
He wants to get in
the studio with you. Come on!

24:06.512 --> 24:08.579
Let's do it.
Let's connect, dawg.

24:08.714 --> 24:11.315
And we're in the middle
of our head-to-head round.

24:11.384 --> 24:14.852
Our next alter egos
wowed the judges
in the auditions,

24:14.987 --> 24:19.056
so please show a lot of love
to fern versus misty rose.

24:19.192 --> 24:20.491
Yeah!

24:22.662 --> 24:24.829
Fern versus misty rose.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.430
These two have the potential

24:26.499 --> 24:29.500
to become true digital
superstars.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.702
Both know how
to work the stage.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.871

that we fell into a rhythm ♪

24:33.940 --> 24:36.073

24:44.517 --> 24:46.684
Both let their
personalities shine.

24:46.752 --> 24:52.122
I love the idea of
my voice being first, not
anything about me externally.

24:52.191 --> 24:55.426
A lot of humans judge me
before they even get the chance
to hear me sing.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.761
And both have the vocal talent.

24:57.830 --> 25:01.198
It's just which is more ready
to be the pop princess?

25:01.300 --> 25:03.901
There's only room for one.

25:04.036 --> 25:06.070
How are you feeling
in your competition

25:06.138 --> 25:08.405
and having to go head-to-head
with one another?

25:08.541 --> 25:11.342
We're a little nervous
about it, but it's okay.

25:11.511 --> 25:14.678
Well, I'm so excited.
I'm going to push the button.
One, two, three, go.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.185
- Whoo!
- Oh, yeah!

25:33.499 --> 25:35.099
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

25:35.234 --> 25:37.935
- Hello.
- My first question is,

25:38.070 --> 25:39.637
so let's say you get
a career off this,

25:39.705 --> 25:43.173
what would be your first act
as the winner of this show?

25:43.309 --> 25:47.077
I think that this whole
technology behind the show

25:47.146 --> 25:49.346
is so incredibly innovative.

25:49.415 --> 25:52.750
I would love to kickstart
my career by being
a digital popstar.

25:52.818 --> 25:55.519
I think it's such
a cool concept.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.388
Fern, can I ask you
the same question?

25:57.523 --> 26:00.791
I personally would like to have
a lot of theater influence
in my performances.

26:00.860 --> 26:04.762
I would like to help
a lot of people who are
going through things at home

26:04.864 --> 26:07.898
and show them that
the power of music can really
help them as it does me.

26:11.304 --> 26:13.304
What is coming that
we haven't seen yet?

26:13.439 --> 26:16.740
I think this definitely packs
a little bit more of a punch.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.776
Ooh, she said
she's gonna punch you.

26:20.980 --> 26:24.748
All right, ladies.
Any last words you want
to say to each other?

26:24.817 --> 26:28.285
- You going down.
- May the best girl win.
Let's get it.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.588
- Let's get it!
- Fern, you're up first.

26:30.656 --> 26:33.757
And, misty,
we'll see you next.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.025
Good luck, guys.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.728
I have tourette's,
and I'm usually judged

26:37.863 --> 26:40.598
before I even get
the chance to sing or speak.

26:40.666 --> 26:42.700
But using fern
as my alter ego

26:42.835 --> 26:47.237
was a really great outlet
to be judged on my voice
and my personality

26:47.306 --> 26:50.240
before people even get
the chance to judge me.

26:50.309 --> 26:53.644
People with tourette's
are not accurately
represented in the media.

26:53.713 --> 26:57.715
<i> ♪ don't know what to say </i>

26:57.783 --> 27:00.584
growing up, I didn't really
have someone who acted

27:00.720 --> 27:03.420
or looks like me
on stages or in shows.

27:03.489 --> 27:07.891
So I want to be that person.
That would be so sweet,
to have a little kid be like,

27:08.027 --> 27:09.693
"you act like me
and you look like me,

27:09.762 --> 27:10.761
and you're out doing,
like, the thing."

27:10.896 --> 27:13.430
and I'm like, "oh."

27:13.499 --> 27:15.866
as an alter ego,
I've seen my voice grow a lot.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.502
I'm very grateful. This is
a very gratifying experience.

She's so fun to be around.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.990

27:43.796 --> 27:47.264
I think that misty rose
has great vocal agility.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.466
The rifts and runs
are very clean.

27:49.602 --> 27:53.070

- That as kind of fly.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.005
No pun intended.

30:09.575 --> 30:12.709

30:14.680 --> 30:16.914
will:
That was pretty good.
That was pretty good.

30:16.982 --> 30:20.784
It's very rare that people
bring theatrical music
to pop culture,

30:20.920 --> 30:22.686
and you do that really well.

30:22.788 --> 30:27.391
I get that you could cross
and bring that to
streaming and radio.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.760
You have those qualities
in your voice.

30:29.829 --> 30:32.596
Thank you.
That was my main goal,
so it means a lot.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.765
- Thank you.
- Alanis?

30:34.834 --> 30:36.667
I just feel like
your performance

30:36.802 --> 30:38.869
from the audition to now?

30:39.004 --> 30:42.406
Big, big step up
from my perspective.
I loved it.

30:42.474 --> 30:47.244
- Thank you.
- And if I were to add any
sort of idea or suggestion,

30:47.313 --> 30:51.715
- it would be don't rely
on your wings too much.
- Oh, absolutely.

30:51.784 --> 30:56.753
Body, too. Movement.
Surprise yourself and let
those wings be the extra.

30:56.822 --> 30:59.389
- Yeah.
- Grimes?

30:59.525 --> 31:02.459
I like fern, the whole thing,

31:02.528 --> 31:04.027
but I don't know
if I love it yet,

31:04.096 --> 31:07.064
and I would love to know
who you are more as an artist.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.066
I'd love to feel
more of your presence.

31:09.134 --> 31:10.868
When it gets into these
super competitive things,

31:11.003 --> 31:12.703
it's about who does
the audience remember?

31:12.838 --> 31:15.172
And you've already got
a leg up with your visuals.

31:15.307 --> 31:17.908
So I think if you could
get the vocal there and
the performative elements there,

31:17.977 --> 31:19.176
you have a really good chance.

31:19.311 --> 31:21.245
Mm-hmm.

31:21.313 --> 31:25.215
Well, coming up,
the judges saved her
in the audition round,

31:25.351 --> 31:28.485
but will she impress them enough
to get to the semi-finals?

31:28.587 --> 31:30.921
Misty rose performs,
and then later,

31:30.990 --> 31:33.223
one alter ego will be
heading home tonight.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.158
Stick around to
find out which one.

31:35.227 --> 31:39.429
My imagination's going crazy
just looking at these people.

31:39.498 --> 31:42.032
Where's my alter ego?
I want to get
one of them joints.

31:42.167 --> 31:44.167
I know a guy backstage.
You could probably get one.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.917
Oh, they're going to
the portal.

32:09.328 --> 32:11.662
- Why do I want to make
a dad joke all of a sudden?
- What is happening?

32:11.797 --> 32:15.565
- That was like,
totally, like, sick.
- That's not how I--

32:22.508 --> 32:25.275
welcome back to "alter ego."
I'm rocsi diaz.

32:25.344 --> 32:29.179
The judges really liked fern's
performance of "you and I,"

32:29.315 --> 32:32.916
but her competition is already
ready to take that diamond

32:32.985 --> 32:35.719
and be the one to move on
to the semi-finals.

32:35.788 --> 32:38.755
It's misty rose.

32:38.824 --> 32:42.659
During the audition, I forgot
I was even in all the gear.

32:42.795 --> 32:44.695
I just was like,
okay, I'm her.

so much cooler than me.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.708

33:02.648 --> 33:05.515

33:05.584 --> 33:08.585
The decision that the other
judges and I made

33:08.687 --> 33:12.089
is to put misty through
to the next round.

33:12.224 --> 33:17.127
I think misty rose can be
the next generation superstar.

33:17.262 --> 33:18.228
She's got it going on,
I think.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.263
I have a big personality.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.900

33:26.538 --> 33:31.308

people, their alter egos are
more of masking their identity.

I think misty rose
brings out more of me.

How are you feeling as your
alter ego, and how has that
helped you as a performer?

35:34.299 --> 35:38.668
I honestly feel so
liberated as misty rose.

35:38.737 --> 35:42.772
This whole new identity has
allowed me to grow so much,

35:42.908 --> 35:45.775
not only as a performer,
but as a person, too.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.513
And I'm just so thrilled.

35:49.681 --> 35:55.585
Judges, does misty rose have
what it takes to go further
into this competition?

35:55.654 --> 35:58.755
- Will?
- Tonight your performance
was stellar,

35:58.824 --> 36:04.261
and I'm drawn to how
she's married the singing
component that she has,

36:04.329 --> 36:07.764
the persona,
with the visual art.

36:07.900 --> 36:10.467
I believe that. Trifecta.

36:10.536 --> 36:12.435
All in all, it was a really,
really strong performance.

36:12.504 --> 36:17.174
- I thought she had great
command of her alter ego.
- Thank you.

36:17.309 --> 36:20.977
Rocsi: Alanis are you seeing
that trifecta effect also?

36:21.113 --> 36:25.015
Yeah, I'm seeing a lot
from the audition to now,
and this performance,

36:25.150 --> 36:29.186
- I saw you own that stage.
So that was incredible.
- Thank you so much.

36:30.822 --> 36:33.623
- Grimes?
- I really liked
the performance.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.893
It stood out to me.
I got popstar energy,
and I really liked it.

36:37.029 --> 36:42.465
- Thank you. Girl!
- Rocsi: Coming up,
we're going to find out

36:42.601 --> 36:45.402
who will move on
and whose journey
ends here tonight,

36:45.470 --> 36:48.972
but not before they reveal their
true identity to the judges.

36:49.107 --> 36:51.308
You're watching "alter ego,"
the head-to-heads.

36:54.313 --> 36:58.148
<i> Break in three, two, one.</i>

37:06.658 --> 37:10.560
Welcome back.
You're watching "alter ego."
I am rocsi diaz.

37:10.696 --> 37:14.731
We've seen performances
from both of these alter egos
in the head-to-head,

37:14.866 --> 37:17.334
and now their fates rest
in the judges' hands.

37:17.469 --> 37:21.104
We only have one spot
on that diamond,

37:21.173 --> 37:25.175
which means only one spot
in the semi-finals.

37:25.310 --> 37:28.812
Who do you believe could be
the next generation superstar?

37:31.383 --> 37:34.918
- Will?
- Fern was really
dynamic and awesome.

37:34.987 --> 37:38.421
Misty, the simplicity
of the persona

37:38.490 --> 37:42.058
that you put to this complex
alter ego is brilliant.

37:42.194 --> 37:45.262
This is a hard decision,
because you guys
both sing awesome,

37:45.330 --> 37:49.065
but my decision is going
to lie on who do I tune in to?

37:49.201 --> 37:53.270
It's personalities that you
are magnetically attracted to,

37:53.305 --> 37:55.238
and with that,
the one that's going to go

37:55.307 --> 37:59.643
on the diamond for me
is misty.

37:59.711 --> 38:03.280
Thank you so much!

38:04.883 --> 38:10.420
- Alanis?
- Fern, I loved your having
taken the feedback

38:10.489 --> 38:13.890
from audition times
and applying it so elegantly.

38:14.026 --> 38:17.694
I believe you both are
going to be huge stars.

38:19.865 --> 38:24.067
But ultimately,
I'm going to usher fern
onto the next stage.

38:24.136 --> 38:28.738
- Thank you so much.
- This could still
go either way.

38:28.874 --> 38:31.741
That is one vote
for each of them. Grimes?

38:31.877 --> 38:37.147
I don't know.
You both did a really good job.
This is a very tight race.

38:37.215 --> 38:42.852
But, misty, I just feel like
I just remember her.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.488
We're here to see what
can live past this show.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.757
I feel like
I'm slightly just--

38:47.826 --> 38:50.060
- misty sticks in my brain
a little bit.
- Thank you.

38:50.195 --> 38:53.596
- And so I'm going to say misty.
- Thank you so much.

38:53.665 --> 38:58.335
So there's
two votes for misty rose.
One vote for fern.

38:58.470 --> 39:02.572
Nick, you can either
make this a tie

39:02.641 --> 39:05.308
or you can send misty rose
up on that diamond.

39:07.012 --> 39:09.813
I think what puts it
a little bit over the top

39:09.948 --> 39:12.182
is the edge and the grit...

39:14.619 --> 39:16.786
...Of what I saw from
misty rose tonight.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.456
Thank you so much.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.891
Congratulations, misty rose.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.561
You will head up
onto that diamond

39:24.696 --> 39:28.732
and onto the semi-finals.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.067
Congratulations to you.

39:31.136 --> 39:35.238
Fern, this is the end
of your "alter ego" journey.

39:35.307 --> 39:38.775
I'm so, so sorry.
How are you feeling right now?

39:38.910 --> 39:41.277
You know what?
I'm feeling all right.
I did my best.

39:41.346 --> 39:43.646
I put it all out there
and I'm very grateful.

39:47.352 --> 39:51.421
You know, it would be amazing
for you to sing for us
one last time...

39:51.556 --> 39:53.890
- Absolutely.
- And then finally
come out here

39:54.025 --> 39:55.592
and let them
meet you in person.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.660
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

39:57.729 --> 40:01.297
Everyone, put your hands
together for fern.

40:01.433 --> 40:03.633

What's going through
your mind right now?

41:52.844 --> 41:56.779
Just that I'm super duper
grateful to be here,
and I'm so excited. Hi!

41:56.915 --> 41:59.382
Hi.

41:59.518 --> 42:01.584
Um, and I have
tourette syndrome,

42:01.653 --> 42:03.019
and that's something
I'm very open about,

42:03.188 --> 42:07.490
and fern allowed me
to not be preconceived

42:07.626 --> 42:11.594
by anybody who
wanted to perceive me as this,

42:11.663 --> 42:13.897
you know, little weirdo,
as corny as that sounds.

42:14.032 --> 42:18.668
But, you know,
I have gotten the judgment
when I'm just being myself.

42:18.737 --> 42:21.704
But I like that here
it's just-- it's just me.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.473
It's just my voice
and my attitude.

42:26.878 --> 42:32.682
- You are adorable.
I mean, it looks--
- stop! Stop it, nick.

42:32.751 --> 42:35.952
I just-- I thank you for
sharing your talent with us.

42:36.021 --> 42:41.758
I thought your mannerisms
were bringing theater
to the character.

42:41.826 --> 42:45.161
- But that-- that's you,
so that's awesome.
- No, that's just me.

42:45.230 --> 42:46.863
Will: Yeah, it's magical.

42:46.998 --> 42:49.465
- Thank you!
- Thank you so much, mia.

42:49.601 --> 42:51.234
One more time for mia,
everybody.

42:51.369 --> 42:53.603
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

42:55.173 --> 42:58.274
Rocsi: Tune in next week for
our last head-to-head match up

42:58.343 --> 43:01.544
to see which two alter egos
advance to the semi-finals.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.646
We'll see you next week.
Good night.
