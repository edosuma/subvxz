These are the three finalists

01:04.147 --> 01:05.212
for this year's official

01:05.212 --> 01:06.275
Christmas cookie, Santa.

01:06.484 --> 01:07.484
Oh!

01:11.113 --> 01:12.573
Ummm.

01:12.574 --> 01:14.033
This is fabulous

01:14.241 --> 01:16.076
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho!

01:16.285 --> 01:17.912
Oh, Patty.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.330
Can you please run this down

01:19.331 --> 01:20.539
to mail room 42?

01:20.748 --> 01:22.249
You got it Santa.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.086
Now, where was I?

01:28.965 --> 01:30.779
Mmm...

01:30.780 --> 01:32.593
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho!

01:40.768 --> 01:42.561
- Hey guys!
- Sorry I'm late.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.063
- Hi Mom.
- You made it.

01:44.522 --> 01:45.774
Are you kidding? I would not

01:45.775 --> 01:47.025
miss this for the world.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.610
Oh, Blake, honey it looks

01:49.611 --> 01:50.778
incredible in here.

01:51.654 --> 01:52.843
Thanks Mom.

01:52.844 --> 01:54.032
Emma even helped.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.075
- No I didn't.
- Really?

01:56.450 --> 01:57.451
Well maybe she's

01:57.452 --> 01:58.452
saving all her energy

01:58.661 --> 01:59.662
for the big stocking

01:59.663 --> 02:00.663
hanging ceremony.

02:00.872 --> 02:02.207
This is already way too much.

02:02.208 --> 02:03.541
You guys have gone crazy.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.250
Crazy good?

02:05.710 --> 02:06.710
Nope.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.942
Mom, I put up Dad's

02:08.943 --> 02:10.422
picture if that's okay?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.383
Of course honey.

02:13.092 --> 02:15.219
That's a great spot for it.

02:18.681 --> 02:19.682
That was a really magical

02:19.683 --> 02:20.683
Christmas, wasn't it Em?

02:23.686 --> 02:25.688
- Honey, where are you going?
- Upstairs.

02:25.897 --> 02:27.481
- Hey, we're just
- getting started.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.191
- I brought home
- some marshmallows.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.860
- So what do you say
- we put on some music

02:31.069 --> 02:32.820
- And we put the hot
- cocoa on the stove?

02:33.029 --> 02:34.154
Christmas isn't magical.

02:34.363 --> 02:35.573
It's just cheap

02:35.574 --> 02:36.782
plastic decorations.

02:41.453 --> 02:42.934
Look, because your

02:42.935 --> 02:44.415
father loved Christmas,

02:45.499 --> 02:47.793
- okay, it's important that
- we keep these traditions going

02:48.002 --> 02:50.546
To keep his memory alive.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.548
Well, it's not working.

02:52.757 --> 02:53.757
Emma.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.676
We do this every year.

02:55.885 --> 02:58.054
- We put up these decorations and
- pretend like everything is okay,

02:58.262 --> 03:00.098
Like Dad's still here.

03:00.431 --> 03:01.766
But he's not.

03:02.850 --> 03:03.893
And putting up some

03:03.894 --> 03:04.936
stupid decorations

03:05.144 --> 03:06.979
isn't going to bring him back.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.982
Hey, I love decorations.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.470
It's because you don't remember.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.525
Hey hey, that's enough.

03:12.568 --> 03:13.945
Look I am trying very...

03:14.153 --> 03:15.321
Emma Mary, get back

03:15.322 --> 03:16.488
here right now.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.246
Mom?

03:26.457 --> 03:27.667
Can I write my

03:27.668 --> 03:28.876
letter to Santa now?

03:30.002 --> 03:31.295
Of course you can honey.

03:31.296 --> 03:32.588
That's a great idea.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.376
Emma's starting to forget.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.630
And Blake, he never

04:14.631 --> 04:16.548
even had the chance.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.510
I just wish the kids

04:19.511 --> 04:20.636
could have known you better.

04:22.638 --> 04:23.764
I wish we had a

04:23.765 --> 04:24.890

Mindy, you're holding us up.

06:15.126 --> 06:16.460
- We've already catalogued
- that request.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.337
- Do we really need
- to check it twice?

06:18.545 --> 06:20.505
- These aren't requests,
- they're wishes.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.382

- comes from a human.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.218

06:50.621 --> 06:52.288

06:53.582 --> 06:54.665
toy fire trucks.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.167
- I should have been
- placed in...

06:56.375 --> 06:58.064
BOTH: In the Builders' Workshop.

06:58.065 --> 06:59.753
We know.

06:59.962 --> 07:01.088
Well both of my...

07:01.339 --> 07:02.714
- Both of your parents
- are toy builders.

07:03.132 --> 07:04.424
And I got...

07:04.883 --> 07:06.927
- The best grades in this year's
- toy building exams.

07:07.136 --> 07:09.180
- We get it.
- You don't like the Mailroom.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.431
- I know you'd rather be
- building right now,

07:11.640 --> 07:12.704
But it's just as important

07:12.705 --> 07:13.767
that we open these letters

07:13.976 --> 07:15.477
and get these wishes right.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.083
All of these humans

07:17.084 --> 07:18.480
are depending on us.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.691
I guess you're right.

- Okay.

It's not that I don't

07:37.396 --> 07:38.583
like the Mailroom.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.794
It's, it's, it's just that...

07:41.003 --> 07:42.921
It's that you hate it.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.883
- Sorry Sammy.
- I know you love the Mailroom.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.554
It's the best place ever.

07:50.888 --> 07:51.930
Oh.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.391
A special letter.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.267
- We don't see many of
- those these days.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.476
What is it?

07:56.852 --> 07:58.396
- I though you didn't care
- for the mail.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.231
Of course I care for the mail.

08:00.439 --> 08:01.773
If we didn't have mail

08:01.982 --> 08:03.817
- then us builders wouldn't
- know what to build.

08:04.026 --> 08:05.319
It's a letter to

08:05.320 --> 08:06.611
Santa from an adult.

08:07.321 --> 08:08.322
An adult?

08:08.530 --> 08:09.698
What's so special about that?

08:09.907 --> 08:11.742
- Don't they send
- letters every year?

08:11.950 --> 08:13.098
Nope. Humans stop writing

08:13.099 --> 08:14.245
letters to Santa

08:14.453 --> 08:15.704
once they hit their teen years.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.206
Why?

08:17.415 --> 08:18.707
Don't know.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.126
Humans can be funny

08:20.127 --> 08:21.335
in that way, I guess.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.191
That's so silly.

08:23.192 --> 08:24.838
Why wouldn't you want gifts?

08:25.214 --> 08:26.987
I know a lot about humans, and

08:26.988 --> 08:28.759
yes they can be pretty silly.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.011
- I've heard that only some
- of them have dogs as pets.

08:31.220 --> 08:33.472
- If you were a human, wouldn't
- you have like a hundred dogs?

08:33.679 --> 08:34.722
Totally.

08:35.057 --> 08:36.725
- Wouldn't you want
- a hundred dogs Mindy?

08:36.933 --> 08:37.933
What?

08:38.436 --> 08:39.727
What do we have next Sammy?

08:40.145 --> 08:41.855
Ah, letters to Santa from...

08:42.063 --> 08:43.648
Minnedoza.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.789
(knock at door)

08:58.997 --> 09:00.958
Hi everybody, just checking in.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.230
We're getting through

09:02.231 --> 09:03.294
the mail in record time.

09:03.502 --> 09:04.649
Hi George. Why was I

09:04.650 --> 09:05.796
assigned to the Mailroom?

09:06.213 --> 09:07.547
I'm not sure.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.633
- Santa's got a lot
- on his mind right now.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.551
Pre-Christmas jitters perhaps.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.012
You can apply for Builder

09:13.013 --> 09:14.263
again next year.

09:14.763 --> 09:15.973
Next year?

09:16.181 --> 09:17.475
- I have to sort letters
- for a whole...

09:17.682 --> 09:18.976
Tomorrow is Christmas

09:18.977 --> 09:20.269
Eve, Mindy.

09:20.478 --> 09:22.396
- So there's
- lots to be done.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.085
So for now, you all must get

09:24.086 --> 09:25.565
to work in your placements.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.567
With pleasure.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.179
Hey, who likes impressions?

09:35.180 --> 09:36.576
Check this out.

09:37.495 --> 09:38.578
Ho Ho Ho.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.164
You're Santa Claus.

09:40.372 --> 09:42.291
- Check it out, Mindy.
- He's Santa Claus.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.126
Hey Sammy, heads up.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.088
Delivery for Miss Mindy.

09:52.551 --> 09:54.594
Come on Mindy, it's your turn.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.611
Phewwww!

10:15.782 --> 10:17.993
ALL: Noooooo!

10:22.956 --> 10:24.395
Merry day-of-the-eve

10:24.396 --> 10:25.834
before Christmas Eve, George.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.586
- Uh.
- Yes, same to you.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.380
- Please remember that
- Vixen's carrots

10:29.588 --> 10:30.922
Should be steamed not boiled,

10:31.131 --> 10:32.153
and Comet's carrot cake

10:32.154 --> 10:33.175
should be gluten free.

10:33.384 --> 10:34.384
Way ahead of you, sir.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.844
Thank you, Richard.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.931
Good morning Benny.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.351
- Seems like Christmas
- is getting close to Full Cheer.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.874
George, just the man

10:43.875 --> 10:45.187
I've been waiting for.

10:45.396 --> 10:47.606
Now you hold on just a second.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.359
- Ah.
- Here we are.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.092
It's the recipe to

10:54.093 --> 10:55.447
Santa's Secret Christmas cake.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.116
- How did you know
- I was going to ask you for that?

10:59.034 --> 11:00.890
Ah yes, you're the Elf

11:00.891 --> 11:02.746
with all the answers.

11:05.583 --> 11:07.001
This is a picture of a dog

11:07.002 --> 11:08.419
wearing sunglasses.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.253
I do misplace

11:10.254 --> 11:11.671
the answers sometimes.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.257
No need to rush, Benny.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.384
- I'll swing by later
- to pick up that recipe.

11:15.593 --> 11:17.636
Did you maybe want the recipe to

11:17.637 --> 11:19.679
twice cooked chestnuts instead?

11:32.734 --> 11:34.694
So what do you say

11:34.903 --> 11:36.446
we all go

11:36.447 --> 11:37.989
for a little drive after this?

11:38.198 --> 11:39.554
I have a few wreaths to deliver,

11:39.555 --> 11:40.909
but then I thought maybe

11:41.118 --> 11:42.473
the three of us could go skating

11:42.474 --> 11:43.828
after at City Hall.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.037
Yeah, sure.

11:45.789 --> 11:46.831
Pass.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.669
- Or we could watch
- a movie together.

11:52.588 --> 11:53.755
Em, are you feeling okay?

11:54.506 --> 11:55.674
- I thought painting
- was your favorite.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.259
May I be excused?

11:57.260 --> 11:58.636
I have homework.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.179
- Well, actually, no.
- Not yet.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.452
I have a little something

12:03.453 --> 12:04.849
to give you both.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.144
It's a present.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.813
- It arrived today,
- but it's not for Christmas.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.043
It's just a little

12:11.044 --> 12:12.065
something that

12:12.274 --> 12:13.421
your Dad and I thought you

12:13.422 --> 12:14.568
would both really like.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.361
Can we get it now?

12:16.570 --> 12:18.155
- Yes, you can get it now.
- But first I need both of you

12:18.363 --> 12:19.363
To close your eyes.

12:19.448 --> 12:20.532
I'm not closing my eyes.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.742
Just for a second, close 'em.

12:27.623 --> 12:28.873
Can we open them?

12:31.376 --> 12:32.085
Okay, open up.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.462
(barking)

12:33.753 --> 12:34.963
Awwww!

12:34.964 --> 12:36.173
It's so cute.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.216
Is that for real?

12:38.425 --> 12:39.801
Yes it's for real.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.386
Can we keep him?

12:41.970 --> 12:43.888
- Of course, he's part
- of the family now.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.767
- Em, what do you think
- we should we name him?

12:49.811 --> 12:50.854
This is so lame.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.189
You can't replace

12:52.190 --> 12:53.231
Dad with a dog.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.986
Don't worry, Mom.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.488
I'll still take care of him

12:59.489 --> 13:00.780
forever and be his best friend.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.784
Great honey, well...

13:08.163 --> 13:09.477
I have to get going

13:09.478 --> 13:10.790
before it's too late, okay?

13:11.458 --> 13:12.709
Well, can the dog and I come?

13:12.710 --> 13:13.960
We could show him around town.

13:14.169 --> 13:16.004
- I'm sure he'd love
- to see the Christmas lights.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.632
I think that's a great idea.

13:18.633 --> 13:19.924
Go get your boots on.

13:37.735 --> 13:39.069
Sir,

13:39.277 --> 13:40.487
are you working on

13:40.488 --> 13:41.697
the Heknows machine again?

13:42.280 --> 13:43.615
Not to worry.

13:44.408 --> 13:45.722
I'm just trying to make some

13:45.723 --> 13:47.035
improvements to this old thing.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.038
Could you please

13:50.039 --> 13:51.248
hand me the hammer?

13:52.624 --> 13:53.980
This old thing has been showing

13:53.981 --> 13:55.335
us who's been naughty or nice

13:55.544 --> 13:57.295
for the past few hundred years.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.756
With all due respect,

13:58.963 --> 14:00.591
- if it ain't broke,
- don't tinker with it.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.467
Christmas as we know it

14:02.468 --> 14:03.927
is changing.

14:04.762 --> 14:06.638
We must adapt, dear George.

14:07.431 --> 14:08.431
Don't you see it?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.080
We're getting more letters,

14:11.081 --> 14:12.811
giving more toys.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.146
It's busy, but I guarantee

14:15.355 --> 14:16.752
with the help of the Junior

14:16.753 --> 14:18.149
Elf Interns this afternoon,

14:18.358 --> 14:19.964
all orders will be fulfilled and

14:19.965 --> 14:21.570
ready to fly by tomorrow night.

14:21.779 --> 14:22.946
Wishes.

14:24.448 --> 14:25.512
They are someone's

14:25.513 --> 14:26.575
wishes, not orders.

14:26.784 --> 14:28.660
Oh yes yes, of course.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.078
As long as our Wishers

14:30.079 --> 14:31.288
get what they want.

14:31.789 --> 14:33.832
Yes, but are they getting

14:33.833 --> 14:35.875
what they actually need?

14:36.835 --> 14:39.170
Happiness levels are way down.

14:40.589 --> 14:41.882
Getting what you want

14:41.883 --> 14:43.174
doesn't make you happy

14:43.383 --> 14:45.677
if you don't have what you need.

14:46.804 --> 14:50.098
Toys aren't the only answer.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.811
If only there were a way

14:54.436 --> 14:56.063
for us to really know

14:56.064 --> 14:57.689
what humans need.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.087
Mighty mistletoe.

15:00.088 --> 15:01.109
What do we do?

15:01.318 --> 15:02.840
We are in so much trouble.

15:02.841 --> 15:04.362
So much.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.260
Okay guys, we are

15:06.261 --> 15:07.282
three smart Elves,

15:07.491 --> 15:09.159
we can figure this out.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.202
Has this ever happened before?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.454
Never.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.665
Maybe we should just tell Santa.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.041
He'll know what to do, right?

15:17.626 --> 15:19.210
Yeah, we should tell Santa.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.505
No, wait.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.507
- We need to try to figure
- this out by ourselves.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.696
Mindy, I know you're

15:25.697 --> 15:26.968
a great builder and all,

15:27.177 --> 15:28.928
- but there are even
- things you can't fix.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.930
Just let me think.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.558
We should tell someone.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.206
Maybe George,

15:35.207 --> 15:36.645
he's Santa's right hand Elf.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.313
I got it.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.735
(snoring)

15:47.865 --> 15:49.407
(snoring)

15:49.616 --> 15:51.034
Coast is clear.

15:57.582 --> 15:58.958
(snoring)

16:06.049 --> 16:07.049
Guys.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.426
Focus.

16:14.265 --> 16:15.265
Ahem.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.601
Um, excuse me.

16:16.602 --> 16:17.769
Benny?

16:17.977 --> 16:18.978
Wha...

16:19.855 --> 16:20.855
Yes?

16:21.940 --> 16:23.400
You have a...

16:24.735 --> 16:25.799
Oh, yes.

16:25.800 --> 16:26.862
I know.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.070
Christmas cake.

16:28.822 --> 16:29.865
Benny.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.449
I need to talk to you.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.077
Right.

16:33.078 --> 16:34.244
I've been expecting you.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.789
You have?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.791
I know what you want to ask me.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.668
You do?

16:42.544 --> 16:44.129
You want to know why

16:44.130 --> 16:45.714
Santa put you in the Mailroom

16:46.172 --> 16:47.340
rather than the

16:47.341 --> 16:48.508
Builders' Workshop.

16:48.717 --> 16:49.823
Well obviously Santa

16:49.824 --> 16:50.928
made a mistake.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.221
A mistake, you say?

16:54.431 --> 16:55.431
Hmmm.

16:56.892 --> 16:57.997
CAM:

16:57.998 --> 16:59.102
Santa's Mistake Book!

16:59.477 --> 17:00.854
(coughing)

17:03.398 --> 17:04.482
Ah.

17:04.691 --> 17:05.943
Just as I thought.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.277
- It's empty.

17:07.278 --> 17:08.403
- But?

17:08.612 --> 17:09.820
Mistakes don't happen

17:09.821 --> 17:11.030
at the North Pole.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.345
I don't know

17:12.346 --> 17:13.450
why we even have the book.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.431
How'd you know she was

17:15.432 --> 17:16.661
put in the Mailroom?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.309
Wait. Are you the Elf

17:18.310 --> 17:19.748
with all the answers?

17:20.164 --> 17:21.164
Yes.

17:21.833 --> 17:22.876
Who are you?

17:23.084 --> 17:24.397
Classic.

17:24.398 --> 17:25.712
Can I ask you a question?

17:26.128 --> 17:27.756
- Those who ask
- the right questions

17:27.964 --> 17:30.008
Will find the right answers.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.760
- Do you know where
- the puppies are at?

17:31.969 --> 17:33.344
I really wanted to meet one.

17:34.471 --> 17:35.847
Cam, not now.

17:37.599 --> 17:38.599
Mindy?

17:39.893 --> 17:41.060
George.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.647
Christmas cake.

17:43.855 --> 17:45.023
Thank you Benny.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.608
Mindy, what are you three

17:46.609 --> 17:47.943
doing here?

17:48.151 --> 17:49.694
- Everything alright
- in the Mailroom?

17:49.903 --> 17:51.571
Of course everything's

17:51.572 --> 17:53.239
alright in the Mailroom.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.325
Why do you ask?

17:55.533 --> 17:56.931
Because you're here,

17:56.932 --> 17:58.328
and not there.

17:59.496 --> 18:01.122
We're just taking a break,

18:01.331 --> 18:02.624
and hanging out with

18:02.625 --> 18:03.917
our old friend, Remmy.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.251
Benny.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.004
Benny.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.964
- Maybe I should just
- take a quick peek.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.715
BOTH: Nooo!

18:11.257 --> 18:12.759
Ah, everything's alright

18:12.760 --> 18:14.260
in there, promise.

18:14.469 --> 18:15.554
We were just

18:15.555 --> 18:16.638
stretching our legs.

18:17.514 --> 18:19.140
- Very well then.
- Carry on.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.059
Still lots of work for us to do.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.103
We Elves don't rest until this

18:23.104 --> 18:24.938
Wish-O-Meter is at 100 percent.

18:25.981 --> 18:27.357
That's strange.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.047
The Wish-O-Meter seems

18:30.048 --> 18:31.486
to have moved backwards.

18:31.695 --> 18:33.321
Moved backwards?

18:33.530 --> 18:34.531
Odd.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.783
That can't be.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.119
George did you forget

18:39.120 --> 18:40.662
your glasses again?

18:41.872 --> 18:43.748
You're probably right Mindy.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.375
Very well then, carry on.

18:46.084 --> 18:47.585
Oh, and Mindy.

18:48.045 --> 18:49.170
Ah ha.

18:49.587 --> 18:50.588
About the Mailroom.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.716
I know you wanted to be placed

18:52.717 --> 18:54.051
in the Builders' Workshop,

18:54.258 --> 18:55.552
but I think you will

18:55.553 --> 18:56.845
excel in mail.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.643
We're Time Elves and

19:03.644 --> 19:04.644
there's no time.

19:04.853 --> 19:06.480
Santa has to leave early now and

19:06.481 --> 19:08.106
were still not at full cheer.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.024
No time.

19:09.232 --> 19:10.274
Not a full cheer?

19:10.483 --> 19:11.818
Christmas is ruined.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.071
We should have been Mail Elves.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.303
I think I'm gonna

19:18.304 --> 19:20.284
have an Elf attack.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.828
Andy, do your Elf dance.

19:21.829 --> 19:23.162
That always calms you down.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.040
Okay.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.230
I'm an Elf and this

19:27.231 --> 19:28.585
is my Elf dance.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.294
(beatbox Christmas music)

19:31.046 --> 19:32.296
That's what I'm talking about.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.135
Will you two stop dancing?

19:37.802 --> 19:39.804
We don't have time for dancing.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.640
(beatbox Christmas music)

19:43.182 --> 19:44.809
As I was saying,

19:45.018 --> 19:46.603
mistakes don't happen

19:46.604 --> 19:48.187
at the North Pole.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.732
Yeah, but what if they did?

19:50.941 --> 19:53.484
But, we are just curious.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.132
Because we have all of those

19:55.133 --> 19:56.571
letters in that Mailroom,

19:56.780 --> 19:57.948
every last one.

19:58.156 --> 20:02.077
And everything is going great.

20:02.577 --> 20:03.787
Let me see.

20:04.579 --> 20:05.726
Okay.

20:05.727 --> 20:06.873
Here we go.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.920
"If wishes are not heard,

20:12.129 --> 20:13.130
they cannot be

20:13.131 --> 20:14.131
fulfilled."

20:15.298 --> 20:16.987
"Those humans whose

20:16.988 --> 20:18.676
wishes are unfulfilled

20:18.885 --> 20:20.804
would stop believing..."

20:25.100 --> 20:26.851
Ah, here's the good stuff.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.876
"If humans stop believing

20:30.877 --> 20:33.024
in the magic of Christmas

20:33.232 --> 20:36.027
it will inevitably lead

20:36.235 --> 20:38.071
- to the end of Christmas
- itself."

20:39.739 --> 20:40.739
Oh boy.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.242
Good thing that's not happening.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.122
Cookie?

20:54.212 --> 20:55.672
- I can't believe
- that just happened.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.340
Christmas is not ruined yet.

20:57.341 --> 20:58.800
Not even close.

20:59.009 --> 20:59.801
- CAM:
- This is bad.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.094
So bad.

21:01.803 --> 21:03.429
Don't worry, we can fix this.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.682
- Did you see the Wish-O-Meter?
- It went backwards.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.350
Backwards.

21:07.642 --> 21:08.852
- And when those letters
- landed in the fireplace

21:09.060 --> 21:09.811
They must've vanished.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.146
Vanished.

21:11.354 --> 21:12.897
- And if we can't
- find all of them,

21:13.314 --> 21:14.732
- It could be the end
- of Christmas altogether.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.567
Lose Christmas.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.111
I know.

21:19.029 --> 21:20.155
Let's try to calm down.

21:20.363 --> 21:21.489
Calm down?

21:21.698 --> 21:23.367
We just lost

21:23.368 --> 21:25.035
an entire town's wishes.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.247
No, no need to do that.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.332
- We need to think
- of the positive here.

21:31.541 --> 21:32.542
We've just misplaced

21:32.543 --> 21:33.543
a few letters.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.880
We were expecting 48 letters.

21:37.088 --> 21:39.590
That's 48 wishes gone.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.323
But compared to a few million

21:42.324 --> 21:43.928
others that we didn't lose,

21:44.137 --> 21:46.014
that's not so bad, right?

21:46.472 --> 21:47.472
Right.

21:47.849 --> 21:49.142
Not right.

21:50.894 --> 21:51.958
Those poor people

21:51.959 --> 21:53.021
from Minnedoza.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.877
We'll never find out

21:54.878 --> 21:56.107
what their wishes were.

21:56.566 --> 21:57.797
Wait.

21:57.798 --> 21:59.027
Sammy, that name,

21:59.236 --> 22:01.238
Minnedoza.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.509
That's where the wishes

22:02.510 --> 22:03.573
came from, right?

22:03.781 --> 22:04.781
Right.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.702
- And all of Minnedoza's Christmas
- letters came from that tube.

22:07.911 --> 22:09.412
Yeah.

22:09.620 --> 22:10.642
And we don't necessarily

22:10.643 --> 22:11.664
need their letters,

22:11.873 --> 22:13.499
we just need their wishes.

22:13.708 --> 22:14.751
Wait. I think I know what

22:14.752 --> 22:15.793
you're thinking

22:16.002 --> 22:17.122
and I don't think I like it.

22:17.545 --> 22:18.963
What is she thinking?

22:19.172 --> 22:20.340
We need to get the wishes

22:20.341 --> 22:21.507
straight from the source.

22:23.093 --> 22:24.302
The humans?

22:24.510 --> 22:25.636
Exactly.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.346
We just go to Minnedoza,

22:27.555 --> 22:29.348
- we ask the humans
- what they want for Christmas,

22:29.557 --> 22:31.184
- And then we report
- them back here.

22:31.392 --> 22:32.392
Problem solved.

22:32.769 --> 22:33.874
Problem solved.

22:33.875 --> 22:34.979
Are you kidding me?

22:35.188 --> 22:36.648
Oh, Elves can't just leave the

22:36.649 --> 22:38.108
North Pole without permission.

22:38.316 --> 22:39.693
And they certainly can't

22:39.694 --> 22:41.069
interact with humans.

22:41.278 --> 22:42.383
That's gotta be breaking

22:42.384 --> 22:43.487
at least five Elf codes.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.906
It's better than doing nothing

22:45.115 --> 22:47.075
- and causing
- the end of Christmas.

22:47.284 --> 22:49.077
- Is anyone else starting
- to see sugar plums

22:49.286 --> 22:50.620
Dancing around their heads?

22:50.828 --> 22:52.059
Maybe it's best

22:52.060 --> 22:53.290
if you stay here.

22:53.497 --> 22:55.583
- You can keep things running
- smoothly in the Mailroom.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.460
We'll pretend to be humans.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.921
Yes, but you have to blend in.

23:00.130 --> 23:01.410
If anyone finds out you're Elves

23:01.505 --> 23:02.653
and you've lost

23:02.654 --> 23:03.800
the town's wishes,

23:04.008 --> 23:05.843
it could cause Christmas chaos.

23:06.136 --> 23:07.262
Hey you're talking

23:07.263 --> 23:08.387
to the Human Expert here.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.478
- I bet I can find
- some stuff like this

23:15.686 --> 23:16.938
In the Clothing Createatorium.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.537
Wow.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.333
This may actually work.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.542
You totally look like humans.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.878
Minn-e-doza, here we come.

23:41.296 --> 23:42.421
Let's roll.

23:45.008 --> 23:46.467
Just let me build this first.

23:46.676 --> 23:48.261
Jingle walkie-talkies.

23:49.053 --> 23:50.763
Okay so all I need to do

23:50.972 --> 23:52.474
is reverse the direction

23:52.475 --> 23:53.975
of the delivery mechanism.

23:55.059 --> 23:56.060
There.

23:56.269 --> 23:57.728
Oh, and one more thing.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.147
Here, Sammy.

23:59.356 --> 24:00.648
Jingle walkie-talkies.

24:00.982 --> 24:02.441
- We can use them to relay
- the wishes back to you,

24:02.650 --> 24:04.443
- So you can give them
- to the Builders.

24:09.615 --> 24:10.616
Testing, testing -

24:10.617 --> 24:11.617
one, two, three.

24:12.535 --> 24:13.661
Did you hear that?

24:13.870 --> 24:14.871
Yes.

24:15.205 --> 24:16.455
- Cool.
- They work.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.545
This is going to be a long trip.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.982
Looks like we made it.

24:43.191 --> 24:44.338
Mighty mistletoe.

24:44.339 --> 24:45.484
Look at all those humans.

24:51.908 --> 24:53.659
- Ow, you're stepping
- on my foot.

24:53.868 --> 24:55.099
What's your foot

24:55.100 --> 24:56.329
doing under my foot?

25:01.834 --> 25:02.961
What do we say?

25:02.962 --> 25:04.087
What should we say?

25:04.295 --> 25:06.923
Oh, hi little girl.

25:07.298 --> 25:08.632
Give us your wishes.

25:13.888 --> 25:15.494
A hug. I've read about

25:15.495 --> 25:17.100
those in human-studies.

25:17.308 --> 25:18.664
A hug is one of human's

25:18.665 --> 25:20.019
most treasured greetings.

25:20.228 --> 25:22.397
Huh, that's interesting.

25:22.398 --> 25:24.565
I hope that we get some hugs.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.485
We gotta get out there, Sammy.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.070
We can't just sit in here and

25:29.071 --> 25:30.447
wait for humans to come to us.

25:31.239 --> 25:32.615
Rolling snowballs!

25:32.616 --> 25:33.991
It's a dog, it's a real dog.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.785
- Okay, enough.
- Focus.

25:35.993 --> 25:37.495
End of Christmas, remember?

25:37.703 --> 25:38.746
Right.

25:38.955 --> 25:41.416
But that kid, with the dog.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.376
That's our first wish.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.924
Excuse us, normal human

25:49.925 --> 25:52.093
beings coming through.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.473
Why is everybody looking at us?

25:56.680 --> 25:58.766
- I don't know.
- Let me check my human textbook.

26:12.322 --> 26:14.573
Awkward book pose.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.391
I saw something about

26:19.392 --> 26:20.538
this on the news.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.123
Some new trend...

26:22.332 --> 26:23.707
time travel challenge?

26:31.841 --> 26:33.176
- Oh.
- Sorry.

26:35.678 --> 26:36.804
Hello?

26:37.221 --> 26:38.473
A greeting.

26:47.357 --> 26:48.691
That was a success.

26:48.899 --> 26:50.193
This is ridiculous.

26:50.401 --> 26:51.444
That textbook of yours

26:51.445 --> 26:52.487
must be out of date.

26:53.070 --> 26:54.322
Girl, that's whack.

26:54.989 --> 26:56.491
Stick to the plan.

26:56.492 --> 26:57.992
Let's get this kid's wish.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.288
Do you like the snow?

27:02.289 --> 27:03.789
I love the snow.

27:04.665 --> 27:06.750
Uh, hello fellow tiny human.

27:06.959 --> 27:07.959
Whoops

27:16.260 --> 27:17.428
How'd you do that?

27:17.636 --> 27:18.679
Do what?

27:18.888 --> 27:20.097
That was awesome.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.892
- You've never seen
- a handshake before?

27:23.100 --> 27:25.019
No, you moved in super speed.

27:25.228 --> 27:26.228
Super speed?

27:26.312 --> 27:27.312
I don't think so.

27:27.355 --> 27:28.523
That's impossible.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.608
- Hello.
- Is that a dog?

27:30.816 --> 27:32.818
I always wanted to meet a dog.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.449
Who are you guys?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.451
Why are you dressed like Elves?

27:41.619 --> 27:42.870
We're not dressed like Elves.

27:43.079 --> 27:44.997
We're dressed like human kids.

27:45.623 --> 27:47.145
Okay, no human kid

27:47.146 --> 27:48.667
talks like that.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.005
Or moves that fast.

27:53.214 --> 27:54.465
- I don't know what
- you think you saw,

27:54.673 --> 27:55.633
- But we're going
- to need you to forget

27:55.841 --> 27:57.343
- That you saw what
- you think you saw.

27:58.135 --> 27:59.324
No I can't.

27:59.325 --> 28:00.513
I saw that.

28:01.222 --> 28:02.745
SAMMY:

28:02.746 --> 28:04.267
North Pole to Mindy.

28:01.222 --> 28:04.267
North Pole to Mindy.

28:04.475 --> 28:05.810
Did you make it?

28:05.811 --> 28:07.144
Please let me know.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.146
North Pole?

28:09.355 --> 28:12.066
What, are you actual Elves?

28:12.275 --> 28:13.484
What are you doing here?

28:13.692 --> 28:14.860
We can't tell you.

28:16.571 --> 28:18.031
If anyone found out

28:18.032 --> 28:19.490
that we've lost the whole

28:16.571 --> 28:19.490
town's Christmas wishes,

28:19.698 --> 28:20.884
there could be Christmas chaos.

28:20.908 --> 28:21.951
Cam.

28:21.952 --> 28:22.993
Shhhhh!

28:23.202 --> 28:24.454
No way.

28:24.662 --> 28:26.456
You lost all our wishes?

28:26.664 --> 28:27.853
Well we didn't

28:27.854 --> 28:29.041
necessarily lose them,

28:29.250 --> 28:30.418
we just don't know

28:30.419 --> 28:31.586
where they are.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.401
So you need to go around town

28:34.402 --> 28:35.881
and get everybody's wishes?

28:37.550 --> 28:39.218
- Ha.
- That's so cool.

28:39.427 --> 28:41.116
Well, it's not exactly

28:41.117 --> 28:42.805
an ideal situation for us.

28:43.013 --> 28:45.182
- So, if you could just tell us
- your Christmas wish,

28:45.391 --> 28:46.391
We'll be on our way.

28:46.643 --> 28:48.018
Let me help you.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.687
Oh no.

28:50.313 --> 28:51.397
I can help you.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.149
It's a pretty small town

28:53.150 --> 28:54.358
and I know everyone in it.

28:54.567 --> 28:55.610
At least the kids anyhow.

28:55.818 --> 28:57.736
- We could probably
- use the help.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.886
And he probably knows a lot

29:00.887 --> 29:02.700
about humans cuz, well...

29:03.742 --> 29:05.140
I'm Blake Williams, and I

29:05.141 --> 29:06.537
asked Santa for a new bike.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.039
There.

29:08.040 --> 29:09.332
That's one wish off your list.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.459
Sammy, we've got our first wish.

29:11.668 --> 29:13.670
- And we've got some human help.
- Yes.

29:13.877 --> 29:16.255
- I'll go tell my Mom that
- I'm going to walk the dog home.

29:16.464 --> 29:17.611
And, we need to get

29:17.612 --> 29:18.757
you some new clothes.

29:20.009 --> 29:21.010
C'mon.

29:36.233 --> 29:37.233
Sammy.

29:38.944 --> 29:41.238
- Working up a sweat,
- processing those letters I see.

29:41.447 --> 29:42.781
Oh, yes sir.

29:43.574 --> 29:45.034
Where are the others?

29:45.242 --> 29:46.242
Others?

29:46.869 --> 29:48.475
The other... letters

29:48.476 --> 29:50.080
are right here.

29:50.748 --> 29:51.832
These last bags

29:51.833 --> 29:52.916
of wishes that we have

29:53.125 --> 29:54.627
here in the Mailroom

29:54.628 --> 29:56.128
at this present moment.

29:56.337 --> 29:58.589
I meant Mindy and Cam.

29:59.423 --> 30:00.216
Where are they?

30:00.424 --> 30:01.718
Mindy and Cam?

30:02.385 --> 30:03.385
Where are they?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.054
They...

30:05.262 --> 30:06.389
are...

30:06.597 --> 30:07.724
where?

30:09.892 --> 30:11.602
Is it hot in here?

30:11.810 --> 30:13.124
Yes, I suppose it

30:13.125 --> 30:14.438
is a little stuffy.

30:15.272 --> 30:16.940
It is hot in here.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.381
So, therefore, Mindy and Cam

30:19.382 --> 30:21.612
they just slid out, stepped out,

30:21.820 --> 30:23.802
to get some air

30:23.803 --> 30:25.783
to breathe that is cold.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.160
Okay.

30:28.703 --> 30:29.912
Very well.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.997
Breaks are certainly permitted.

30:32.206 --> 30:33.708
- You look like you could
- use one yourself, Sammy.

30:34.792 --> 30:35.918
Ha.

30:36.126 --> 30:37.670
- Just be sure
- that the three of you

30:37.878 --> 30:39.088
Work at a good pace

30:39.089 --> 30:40.297
when they return.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.299
You know we will.

30:55.312 --> 30:56.312
(barking)

30:57.398 --> 30:58.649
Wow.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.863
- Well, my mom and I decorated
- this whole place.

31:05.072 --> 31:06.345
We went kind of Christmas

31:06.346 --> 31:07.617
crazy this year.

31:08.325 --> 31:09.410
C'mon.

31:17.251 --> 31:18.795
This is a Christmas tree.

31:19.670 --> 31:20.671
Woooh.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.965
- Did your sister help
- you decorate it?

31:23.800 --> 31:25.259
- Nah.
- She's a bit of a Scrooge.

31:25.468 --> 31:26.636
What's a Scrooge?

31:26.844 --> 31:28.596
- It's someone who doesn't
- like Christmas.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.097
There are humans

31:30.098 --> 31:31.307
who don't like Christmas?

31:33.016 --> 31:34.727
You must like Christmas, right?

31:34.935 --> 31:36.020
Are you kidding?

31:36.021 --> 31:37.104
I love Christmas.

31:37.438 --> 31:39.189
- That's what Christmas
- looks like.

31:39.398 --> 31:40.483
And check this out.

31:42.777 --> 31:44.027
Smell that?

31:44.236 --> 31:46.196
- That's what Christmas
- smells like.

31:46.947 --> 31:48.428
Christmas smells like

31:48.429 --> 31:49.908
those candles we make

31:46.947 --> 31:49.908
back in the North Pole.

31:50.451 --> 31:51.535
Follow me.

32:00.294 --> 32:01.962
- MINDY:
- Is that a Christmas tree?

32:02.379 --> 32:03.379
Hello?

32:03.840 --> 32:05.508
- (laughs)
- Christmas tree.

32:05.716 --> 32:06.925
That one isn't decorated

32:07.134 --> 32:08.845
- because it's for
- the winter fair tomorrow.

32:16.185 --> 32:17.561
My Mom and I decorate

32:17.770 --> 32:19.689
- the whole Community Centre
- with all this stuff.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.736
You decorate with socks?

32:26.821 --> 32:27.905
Father Christmas.

32:28.656 --> 32:29.948
Look at this tool box.

32:33.410 --> 32:34.578
Woaah.

32:34.787 --> 32:35.907
What does this have in here?

32:36.079 --> 32:37.915
That was my Dad's.

32:38.123 --> 32:41.168
We don't really use it anymore.

32:41.377 --> 32:42.441
My Mom doesn't want to go

32:42.442 --> 32:43.504
through his stuff anymore

32:43.713 --> 32:45.381
cuz he passed away.

32:45.673 --> 32:46.965
Passed away?

32:48.133 --> 32:49.719
- Oh, ah.
- He died.

32:49.927 --> 32:51.136
Six years ago.

32:51.345 --> 32:52.388
That's so sad.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.306
Yeah.

32:54.515 --> 32:55.621
I don't really remember him

32:55.622 --> 32:56.726
because I was pretty young

32:56.934 --> 32:58.977
but I still miss him.

32:59.186 --> 33:00.187
He was a great Dad.

33:00.730 --> 33:02.106
At least, that's what

33:02.107 --> 33:03.482
people always tell me.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.776
Here, you'd like this.

33:16.913 --> 33:18.706
What have you done to Santa?

33:18.915 --> 33:20.875
- No, it's not the
- real Santa suit.

33:21.417 --> 33:23.085
- Humans have this
- tradition at Christmas

33:23.293 --> 33:24.336
Where they sometimes

33:24.337 --> 33:25.379
dress up as Santa.

33:25.588 --> 33:27.256
- CAM:
- That's pretty weird.

33:27.464 --> 33:29.383
- My Dad used to wear this suit
- every Christmas Eve

33:29.592 --> 33:31.218
- At the Winter Wonderland
- and perform

33:31.427 --> 33:33.470
- The Night Before Christmas
- for the whole town.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.014
See?

33:38.100 --> 33:39.560
The Night Before Christmas.

33:39.561 --> 33:41.019
That's his handwriting.

33:41.771 --> 33:42.980
Cool.

33:44.440 --> 33:45.712
I don't remember him

33:45.713 --> 33:46.984
ever performing it,

33:47.192 --> 33:48.444
but it must have

33:48.445 --> 33:49.695
been pretty special.

33:50.279 --> 33:51.781
(car sounds from outside)

33:53.282 --> 33:54.742
- Oh no, we weren't
- supposed to be in here.

33:54.951 --> 33:55.993
My Mom's home.

33:55.994 --> 33:57.035
Ah, clean.

33:58.788 --> 34:00.038
We're on it.

34:00.664 --> 34:02.124
Ah, that way.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.183
Blake?

34:20.391 --> 34:21.601
- BLAKE:
- Hi Mom.

34:30.735 --> 34:31.735
That was close.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.071
You guys okay?

34:34.614 --> 34:36.429
We can organize this

34:36.429 --> 34:38.243
for you if you like.

34:38.452 --> 34:39.870
It'll take seven seconds.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.664
No, that's okay. Here.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.833
- Just take these.
- It will help you blend in.

34:45.708 --> 34:46.918
Are you sure?

34:48.253 --> 34:49.547
Well, let's go

34:49.547 --> 34:50.840
collect some wishes.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.800
- We can't go out now,
- it's getting late.

34:53.009 --> 34:54.384
Kids will be going to bed soon.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.719
- Then we'll sneak into their
- rooms and wake them up.

34:57.847 --> 34:59.181
That's not a very good idea.

34:59.389 --> 35:00.933
- You guys don't know much
- about humans, do you?

35:02.935 --> 35:04.175
Come to school with me tomorrow

35:04.311 --> 35:06.104
- and we can get all
- the wishes at once.

35:06.313 --> 35:07.481
But tomorrow night

35:07.482 --> 35:08.649
is Christmas Eve.

35:08.858 --> 35:10.067
That's not going

35:10.068 --> 35:11.276
to leave us much time.

35:11.485 --> 35:12.486
I've seen how fast you

35:12.487 --> 35:13.487
guys move. We'll be fine.

36:09.251 --> 36:10.273
Mom!

36:10.274 --> 36:11.294
Time to go.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.303
Moo Cow.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.139
- Look what I found, Mindy.
- Moo Cow.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.640
You know Moo Cow?

36:23.849 --> 36:25.267
- Of course, we make them
- in the North Pole.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.310
Wanna play?

36:27.519 --> 36:28.979
- I already know
- all of the cards off by heart.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.313
I'll win too quickly.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.774
It's not about winning.

36:31.982 --> 36:33.776
- It's about being silly
- and having fun.

36:34.568 --> 36:35.945
I don't get it.

36:36.153 --> 36:37.905
- It's all about making
- the other person laugh.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.116
So, I pick a card.

36:41.784 --> 36:42.952
Here we go.

36:47.289 --> 36:48.916
Are you okay?

36:49.792 --> 36:51.209
I'll give you another clue.

36:51.418 --> 36:52.544
Oooo ooo ooo ooh!

36:53.420 --> 36:55.089
- Oh, oh!
- You're a monkey.

36:55.422 --> 36:56.423
That's it.

36:57.133 --> 36:58.718
And I get two points

36:58.719 --> 37:00.302
and the next person goes.

37:00.510 --> 37:01.595
I wanna go next.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.226
Um... A fish?

37:08.435 --> 37:09.061
Benny?

37:09.269 --> 37:10.353
An angry fish?

37:10.854 --> 37:12.189
A Santa Claus?

37:16.276 --> 37:17.276
Ummm...

37:18.195 --> 37:19.655
I'm an elephant, guys.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.783
- BLAKE:
- That's the craziest

37:20.906 --> 37:22.783
Elephant I've ever seen.

37:22.992 --> 37:24.451
(knock on the door)

37:24.660 --> 37:25.619
- Blake,
- what's going on in there?

37:25.828 --> 37:27.079
- That's my sister.
- Hide!

37:29.539 --> 37:30.539
What?

37:30.666 --> 37:31.834
Open the door.

37:32.584 --> 37:33.836
- No, just duck down.

37:33.837 --> 37:35.087
- Quack, quack, quack!

37:35.295 --> 37:36.713
- No, I don't mean
- be a duck, just...

37:37.131 --> 37:38.215
Never mind.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.220
- Hey, Em.
- What's up?

37:44.096 --> 37:45.472
What's going on in there?

37:45.681 --> 37:47.474
- I'm not leaving
- until you tell me.

37:47.683 --> 37:49.185
We were just playing Moo Cow,

37:49.392 --> 37:50.978
- I was... I was just
- playing Moo Cow.

37:51.187 --> 37:52.354
- You can't play
- that game by yourself.

37:52.562 --> 37:53.562
You totally can.

37:53.647 --> 37:55.065
I heard people laughing.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.525
I was laughing at myself.

37:56.526 --> 37:57.776
I did something hilarious.

37:57.985 --> 37:59.194
You wanna see the face

37:59.195 --> 38:00.403
I discovered in the mirror?

38:00.612 --> 38:02.531
- A cramp.
- I'm getting a cramp.

38:02.739 --> 38:03.740
I can't be a duck

38:03.741 --> 38:04.741
back here any more.

38:05.408 --> 38:06.576
Ah!

38:06.577 --> 38:07.744
There's too much clutter.

38:10.206 --> 38:11.581
You're so weird.

38:11.790 --> 38:12.875
(noise)

38:13.083 --> 38:14.543
Okay, what's going on?

38:14.835 --> 38:16.503
That was just the dog.

38:17.462 --> 38:18.630
(barking)

38:18.839 --> 38:20.883
Oh hey, how'd you get out here?

38:28.265 --> 38:29.599
No way.

38:30.559 --> 38:32.519
- Now I definitely know
- something's going on.

38:34.146 --> 38:35.272
Do you have a girl in here?

38:35.480 --> 38:36.565
No, why would I have

38:36.566 --> 38:37.649
a girl in here?

38:41.778 --> 38:42.778
(sneeze)

38:45.282 --> 38:46.324
Thanks for stopping by...

38:46.533 --> 38:48.451
- Tell me the truth
- or I'll tell Mom.

38:48.660 --> 38:49.660
Fine.

38:50.162 --> 38:51.747
- I have two Elves in here
- from the North Pole

38:51.955 --> 38:53.165
- And they lost all
- the letters from Minnedoza

38:53.373 --> 38:54.413
And now they need my help.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.418
- Oh, come on.
- That's the truth.

38:56.626 --> 38:57.626
Grow up.

38:58.087 --> 38:59.859
Hey, what in the world

38:59.860 --> 39:01.631
is going on in here?

39:02.258 --> 39:03.675
Blake you cleaned?

39:03.884 --> 39:05.802
He's been acting so weird.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.325
So what, is a person not

39:07.326 --> 39:08.638
allowed to laugh and have fun?

39:08.847 --> 39:10.432
- Remember when you
- used to do that?

39:10.640 --> 39:11.662
Okay, okay that's enough.

39:11.663 --> 39:12.684
It's dinner time.

39:16.939 --> 39:18.190
I like this game.

39:19.816 --> 39:24.905
♪♪

39:50.513 --> 39:51.828
So you're my friends visiting

39:51.829 --> 39:53.142
from up North for Christmas.

39:53.350 --> 39:53.934
Got it?

39:54.143 --> 39:55.644
I'm nervous.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.896
It's okay, you'll be fine.

39:57.897 --> 39:59.397
Just try to act natural.

40:03.986 --> 40:05.362
No hugging.

40:05.862 --> 40:06.905
Right.

40:07.447 --> 40:08.448
- Humans need so many
- Christmas hugs

40:08.657 --> 40:10.367
- That I won't be able
- to do it alone.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.494
- We'll have to form
- a team of huggers.

40:13.036 --> 40:14.204
Just say hi.

40:14.830 --> 40:15.872
Hi.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.124
Hi.

40:17.333 --> 40:17.958
Hi.

40:18.167 --> 40:19.293
Hi.

40:20.961 --> 40:22.587
Stop hugging everyone.

40:23.172 --> 40:24.757
But he had his earmuffs on,

40:24.758 --> 40:26.342
he couldn't hear my Hi.

40:26.716 --> 40:28.135
Cam focus.

40:28.344 --> 40:29.445
We need to get these wishes.

40:29.469 --> 40:31.763
Okay, hands in, on three...

40:33.098 --> 40:34.557
One, two three...

40:34.766 --> 40:36.434
- Wishes!
- Candy Canes!

40:46.653 --> 40:48.822
(indistinct chatter)

40:50.824 --> 40:52.450
That's a pretty cool microscope.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.329
Yeah, it's alright I guess.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.498
You probably want one

40:57.499 --> 40:59.041
for yourself right?

41:00.250 --> 41:01.459
No, not really.

41:01.668 --> 41:02.941
Maybe you asked

41:02.942 --> 41:04.213
Santa for one?

41:04.421 --> 41:05.443
I don't really like

41:05.444 --> 41:06.464
science that much.

41:08.050 --> 41:08.842
Bunsen burner?

41:09.051 --> 41:10.093
No.

41:10.302 --> 41:11.302
Beakers?

41:11.428 --> 41:12.428
No.

41:12.679 --> 41:13.471
A funnel?

41:13.680 --> 41:14.680
No.

41:15.098 --> 41:16.098
A petri dish?

41:16.558 --> 41:17.558
Not really.

41:21.271 --> 41:22.731
A periodic table poster?

41:23.023 --> 41:24.107
No.

41:24.441 --> 41:25.775
Test tubes?

41:26.193 --> 41:28.237
I really just want a new guitar.

41:29.279 --> 41:30.655
Ahhh, that was my next guess.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.491
- And last year I asked
- for a goldfish,

41:33.700 --> 41:35.035
- Which seemed like a pretty
- good idea at the time.

41:35.244 --> 41:37.579
- Yes but...
- But it was nowhere near as bad

41:37.787 --> 41:39.706
- As the train set
- incident of 2012.

41:39.915 --> 41:42.292
- So you can probably understand
- why I have some hesitation to...

41:42.500 --> 41:44.461
- Oh, Dasher!
- I've got to go.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.296
- But I'd really love
- to quickly hear

41:46.504 --> 41:48.006
- Exactly what you asked
- Santa for before I go...

41:48.215 --> 41:49.216
Well I...

41:49.425 --> 41:51.593
(flute)

41:55.722 --> 41:56.348
Hey!

41:56.598 --> 41:57.933
- Oops!
- Sorry.

41:58.141 --> 41:59.435
I was just so wrapped up

41:59.642 --> 42:01.061
- in writing
- my last minute letter to Santa.

42:01.270 --> 42:02.812
Do you want in on this?

42:03.021 --> 42:04.940
- I can jot your wish down
- on here with mine if you like.

42:05.815 --> 42:07.567
- Well, I already wrote
- my letter to Santa.

42:07.776 --> 42:09.403
- Well, it can't hurt
- to tell him twice.

42:09.611 --> 42:11.529
Well I guess so.

42:12.739 --> 42:13.739
Okay.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.744
- And that's why we should
- be giving reindeer

42:18.328 --> 42:19.976
Leafy greens instead of carrots.

42:19.977 --> 42:21.623
Any questions?

42:21.831 --> 42:23.583
- Where'd you get this
- bogus information?

42:23.792 --> 42:25.085
What do you want for Christmas?

42:25.710 --> 42:26.710
Umm..

42:36.305 --> 42:37.847
My stomach!

42:40.142 --> 42:41.310
It aches!

42:41.851 --> 42:43.374
I think I ate too many

42:43.375 --> 42:44.896
of those pizza pies.

42:46.648 --> 42:48.066
That looks like it hurts.

42:48.275 --> 42:49.859
- Yeah.
- And can you believe it?

42:50.068 --> 42:51.820
- I just asked for a new
- hockey stick for Christmas.

42:52.028 --> 42:53.363
That's great.

42:53.571 --> 42:56.325
I mean... bummer.

42:56.533 --> 42:57.742
Yeah, thanks man.

43:14.717 --> 43:16.594
(amplifier hum)

43:25.728 --> 43:26.729
Umm, excuse me.

43:26.730 --> 43:27.730
Hello.

43:27.939 --> 43:29.566
- Why, why aren't you
- looking at me?

43:29.816 --> 43:31.734
- I'm talking to you.
- What device is that?

43:32.402 --> 43:35.113
Um... Okay... hello.

43:36.490 --> 43:37.762
(laughing)

43:37.763 --> 43:39.034
It's fine I got this.

43:39.951 --> 43:41.620
'Anyone who tells me what

43:41.621 --> 43:43.288
they want for Christmas

43:43.497 --> 43:46.082
will get a candy cane!'

43:46.291 --> 43:47.083
And... send.

43:47.292 --> 43:48.292
What?

43:48.377 --> 43:49.627
(notification sound)

43:51.254 --> 43:52.630
(phone beep)

43:54.216 --> 43:55.300
(phone beep)

43:55.509 --> 43:56.968
(phone beep)

43:57.219 --> 43:58.470
(phone beep)

43:59.429 --> 44:00.638
That's five easy wishes.

44:01.848 --> 44:03.725
- I hope you have
- a lot of candy canes.

44:03.933 --> 44:05.185
Oh boy.

44:07.354 --> 44:08.856
I already told you I didn't ask

44:08.857 --> 44:10.357
Santa for any stupid presents.

44:10.566 --> 44:12.234
- Now could you please
- get your weird friends

44:12.442 --> 44:13.562
To stop following me around?

44:13.693 --> 44:14.736
It's mortifying.

44:15.362 --> 44:16.654
- What?
- Who's following you?

And you know why? You know

56:30.410 --> 56:31.973
why, because love prevails.

56:32.181 --> 56:33.891
- Right?
- Love conquers all,

56:34.100 --> 56:35.372
And even though

56:35.373 --> 56:36.644
John is no longer with us,

56:36.852 --> 56:37.895
his love is still

56:37.896 --> 56:38.938
very much with us.

56:39.147 --> 56:40.273
It is. I feel it every

56:40.274 --> 56:41.398
single day, I do.

56:42.317 --> 56:44.485
- So we are going to be fine,
- we're gonna be more than fine.

56:44.693 --> 56:45.945
And I hope you are too.

56:46.654 --> 56:48.531
So have a Merry Christmas

56:48.532 --> 56:50.407
Brent and Sandra.

56:52.701 --> 56:54.224
I guess she doesn't need

56:54.225 --> 56:55.746
any more casseroles.

56:55.955 --> 56:57.019
I think you put too

56:57.020 --> 56:58.082
much cheese on them.

56:58.291 --> 57:00.126
- People don't like
- that much cheese.

57:01.877 --> 57:03.066
And that's what I

57:03.067 --> 57:04.255
want for Christmas.

57:04.463 --> 57:06.423
Okay, Merry Christmas.

57:08.176 --> 57:09.886
We did it!

57:09.887 --> 57:11.595
We did it!

57:11.804 --> 57:13.973
(singing) And it's Merry

57:13.974 --> 57:16.142
Christmas everyone!

57:16.725 --> 57:18.644
Why are we jumping up and down?

57:18.853 --> 57:20.271
We saved Christmas.

57:23.440 --> 57:24.692
Yeah, hey Sammy.

57:24.693 --> 57:25.943
We did it.

57:26.443 --> 57:27.945
Megan wants skates.

57:28.821 --> 57:29.989
Guys there's still

57:29.990 --> 57:31.157
one wish left.

57:32.325 --> 57:33.325
One left?

57:33.492 --> 57:34.743
That should be it.

57:34.952 --> 57:36.037
How?

57:36.038 --> 57:37.121
We got everybody in town.

57:40.082 --> 57:41.480
Sammy, could you help us track

57:41.481 --> 57:42.877
down whoever's wish that was?

57:43.085 --> 57:44.586
No.

57:44.795 --> 57:45.796
But I think I might

57:45.797 --> 57:46.797
know who might know.

57:48.549 --> 57:50.759
Mindy, I think I need to change.

57:51.593 --> 57:52.615
Mindy.

57:52.616 --> 57:53.637
Are you there?

57:54.305 --> 57:55.535
I shouldn't have been wearing

57:55.536 --> 57:56.765
this in the first place.

57:56.974 --> 57:58.434
I think I need to put it back.

58:00.936 --> 58:02.855
Guys, are you listening?

58:03.064 --> 58:05.066
Mhm, what was that?

58:05.274 --> 58:06.734
I need help with the suit.

58:06.942 --> 58:08.277
But it's just a costume.

58:08.278 --> 58:09.611
What's the rush?

58:09.820 --> 58:11.384
Sammy to Mindy.

58:11.385 --> 58:12.948
This is urgent.

58:14.075 --> 58:15.743
- You guys will never be able
- to save Christmas.

58:15.951 --> 58:17.140
You still don't

58:17.141 --> 58:18.329
even understand it.

58:20.456 --> 58:21.561
Hey Blake.

58:21.562 --> 58:22.666
Was that anger?

58:24.210 --> 58:25.502
We gotta talk to him.

58:25.711 --> 58:28.505
There's still one more wish.

58:29.631 --> 58:30.883
You go get it.

58:30.884 --> 58:32.134
I'll talk to Blake.

58:34.178 --> 58:35.408
- Mindy!

58:35.409 --> 58:36.638
- What?

58:36.847 --> 58:38.203
You are not going

58:38.204 --> 58:39.558
to believe this.

58:39.975 --> 58:41.289
Two letters were sent

58:41.290 --> 58:42.603
from 326 Carroll Street.

58:43.271 --> 58:45.689
326 Carroll Street?

58:45.898 --> 58:47.442
Blake's house.

58:47.649 --> 58:49.193
That can't be possible.

58:49.402 --> 58:50.945
Blake only asked for a new bike

58:51.153 --> 58:52.738
and his sister said she didn't

58:52.739 --> 58:54.323
send any letters this year.

58:54.531 --> 58:56.221
Mindy, you have to hurry.

58:56.222 --> 58:57.910
Santa is leaving any minute.

58:58.119 --> 59:00.162
Okay, I'll try my best.

59:00.371 --> 59:01.491
But you have to stall Santa.

59:01.663 --> 59:02.998
Buy us some time.

59:03.207 --> 59:04.583
Rolling snowballs.

59:07.878 --> 59:09.151
Emma, I need to talk

59:09.152 --> 59:10.423
to you for a quick sec.

59:19.848 --> 59:21.433
Emma, please. I'm sorry I

59:21.434 --> 59:23.018
lost your wish. I really am.

59:23.602 --> 59:24.979
Don't take it personally.

59:25.187 --> 59:27.064
- I don't really care
- about any of those letters.

59:27.273 --> 59:28.524
But I was wrong.

59:28.732 --> 59:30.901
Holly jolly I was wrong.

59:31.110 --> 59:33.112
- But I can still fix this.
- I want to make things right.

59:33.321 --> 59:35.448
- Please, I just know the letter
- came from your house.

59:33.321 --> 59:35.448
I just need you to...

59:35.656 --> 59:37.304
I didn't write a letter

59:37.305 --> 59:38.951
to Santa this year.

59:39.243 --> 59:40.703
I haven't written one

59:40.704 --> 59:42.163
since my Dad died.

59:43.122 --> 59:44.457
Don't you get it?

59:44.915 --> 59:46.750
I don't have any wishes.

59:46.959 --> 59:48.461
But you must.

59:48.669 --> 59:49.754
Every human being

59:49.755 --> 59:50.838
has at least one wish.

59:51.046 --> 59:52.590
We take wishes very seriously

59:52.591 --> 59:54.133
up at the North Pole.

59:54.342 --> 59:56.302
- Blake was telling
- the truth, wasn't he?

59:57.094 --> 59:58.137
You're a real Elf.

59:58.513 --> 59:59.555
Emma, please.

59:59.556 --> 01:00:00.597
But yes, yes I am.

01:00:00.806 --> 01:00:02.350
- And if I don't fulfill
- this last wish,

01:00:02.558 --> 01:00:04.310
- Then you'll completely
- stop believing.

01:00:04.519 --> 01:00:06.145
- And if one human stops believing
- in the magic of Christmas

01:00:06.354 --> 01:00:07.771
Then it doesn't get carried on.

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.398
- And before you know it there
- will be no believers

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:10.899
- And it's
- the end of Christmas.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:12.901
- And I still don't totally
- understand Christmas.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.195
But I know neither

01:00:14.196 --> 01:00:15.279
of us want it to end.

01:00:15.654 --> 01:00:16.947
I'm sorry.

01:00:17.532 --> 01:00:18.595
I didn't write a letter

01:00:18.596 --> 01:00:19.658
to Santa this year.

01:00:20.535 --> 01:00:22.077
But I think I know who did.

01:00:22.703 --> 01:00:24.163
- You?
- No.

01:00:24.372 --> 01:00:25.706
- Blake?
- No.

01:00:25.914 --> 01:00:27.749
- You?
- No.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:29.125
Your dog!

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:31.045
No, my Mom.

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.717
She's been talking about how

01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:38.240
all she wants is for us

01:00:38.241 --> 01:00:39.554
to be a family again,

01:00:40.555 --> 01:00:42.181
to be happy.

01:00:43.182 --> 01:00:44.850
Whatever that means.

01:00:47.436 --> 01:00:48.687
I can't build that

01:00:48.688 --> 01:00:49.938
in a Workshop.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:52.649
Santa, wait.

01:00:54.026 --> 01:00:55.590
Hi, Mr. Claus. Uh, you

01:00:55.591 --> 01:00:57.154
look jolly this evening.

01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:59.240
Your sleigh awaits, sir.

01:00:59.448 --> 01:01:00.657
Santa, wait.

01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:02.618
Mindy, Cam and I, we lost

01:01:02.619 --> 01:01:04.161
a whole bag of letters.

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.581
A town called Minnedoza, poof!

01:01:06.788 --> 01:01:08.103
And Mindy and Cam

01:01:08.104 --> 01:01:09.417
they travelled backwards

01:01:06.788 --> 01:01:09.417
through the mail system,

01:01:09.625 --> 01:01:11.544
- and they've disguised
- themselves as human kids.

01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:13.588
- And they've gone around
- talking to humans kids

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:15.381
- And finding out
- about their wishes

01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:16.945
And then relaying

01:01:16.946 --> 01:01:18.300
the message back

01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:18.300
so we can make it come true.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.323
I know.

01:01:20.324 --> 01:01:21.970
Isn't it wonderful?

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:23.431
You knew?

01:01:24.056 --> 01:01:25.370
I see you are not freaking out

01:01:25.371 --> 01:01:26.683
about this as much as I am.

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:30.145
There's still one wish left.

01:01:30.646 --> 01:01:31.856
Santa, I must insist

01:01:31.857 --> 01:01:33.065
you leave now.

01:01:33.274 --> 01:01:34.671
Or you jeopardize Christmas

01:01:34.672 --> 01:01:36.068
for the entire world.

01:01:36.277 --> 01:01:37.841
All right, George.

01:01:37.842 --> 01:01:39.405
Time to fly.

01:01:39.614 --> 01:01:41.053
Santa, wait.

01:01:41.054 --> 01:01:42.491
What should we do?

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.836
What's that supposed to mean?

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.051
- MINDY:
- Blake's Mom!

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.470
Hey Mindy.

01:02:02.678 --> 01:02:04.721
Em, I'm so glad you made it.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.974
So, are you guys having fun?

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.852
Yeah, yeah, uh...

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.438
Mom, did you write a letter

01:02:12.439 --> 01:02:13.814
to Santa this year?

01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:16.692
How'd you know that?

01:02:18.694 --> 01:02:20.737
What present did you wish for?

01:02:22.323 --> 01:02:23.783
No, no, I didn't

01:02:23.784 --> 01:02:25.242
ask for a present.

01:02:25.451 --> 01:02:26.848
It was just more of a...

01:02:26.849 --> 01:02:28.245
silly wish.

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.458
I just wanted my family

01:02:32.459 --> 01:02:33.834
to be happy for Christmas.

01:02:37.588 --> 01:02:39.256
- Mindy, I'm sorry.
- I tried everything.

01:02:39.465 --> 01:02:41.383
- I couldn't stop him.
- We're too late.

01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:45.137
Sammy, it's okay.

01:02:45.138 --> 01:02:46.305
I found the last wish.

01:02:46.514 --> 01:02:48.223
It's Blake's Mom.

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:49.746
She just wants her family

01:02:49.747 --> 01:02:51.059
to be happy again for Christmas.

01:02:52.144 --> 01:02:53.854
We can't make that here.

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.566
Then I'll have to make it here.

01:02:58.734 --> 01:03:00.777
I just need to figure out a way.

01:03:01.529 --> 01:03:02.697
Are you sure she just

01:03:02.698 --> 01:03:03.864
doesn't want a pair of socks?

01:03:04.072 --> 01:03:05.782
Everyone loves socks.

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:09.453
Blake?

01:03:09.662 --> 01:03:11.163
Just go away.

01:03:14.375 --> 01:03:15.959
I can't get him to come out.

01:03:16.168 --> 01:03:18.086
- I've tried every trick
- in the Human Studies book.

01:03:20.047 --> 01:03:21.674
Blake, open up.

01:03:22.758 --> 01:03:24.343
I did not try that.

01:03:30.182 --> 01:03:31.767
I can't remember.

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:33.561
Can't remember what?

01:03:33.769 --> 01:03:35.208
Dad.

01:03:35.209 --> 01:03:36.647
I can't remember Dad.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:39.567
What was it like when he was

01:03:39.775 --> 01:03:40.985
up on stage reading the poem

01:03:40.986 --> 01:03:42.194
in front of the whole town?

01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:44.821
It was amazing.

01:03:50.369 --> 01:03:52.872
Blake, the last wish,

01:03:52.873 --> 01:03:55.374
it was your Mom's.

01:03:55.583 --> 01:03:57.209
Mom wrote a letter?

01:03:58.669 --> 01:04:00.879
- Yeah, but Santa's already left
- the North Pole.

01:04:01.088 --> 01:04:02.368
We're too late for the Workshop.

01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:04.717
What do we do?

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:07.177
- We need to show Mom
- that we're still a family.

01:04:19.607 --> 01:04:21.233
(indistinct chatter)

01:04:32.453 --> 01:04:34.121
(clapping)

01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:49.970
T'was the night

01:04:49.971 --> 01:04:50.971
before Christmas,

01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:55.643
and all through the house,

01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:58.979
not a creature was stirring,

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:01.231
not even a mouse.

01:05:03.317 --> 01:05:05.507
The stockings were hung

01:05:05.508 --> 01:05:07.696
by the chimney with care,

01:05:08.322 --> 01:05:10.074
with hopes that St. Nicholas

01:05:10.075 --> 01:05:11.826
soon would be there.

01:05:14.745 --> 01:05:15.996
The children were nestled

01:05:15.997 --> 01:05:17.247
all snug in their beds,

01:05:17.832 --> 01:05:19.751
while visions of sugarplums

01:05:19.752 --> 01:05:21.669
danced in their heads.

01:05:22.294 --> 01:05:24.442
And Momma in her kerchief,

01:05:24.443 --> 01:05:26.590
and I in my cap

01:05:27.633 --> 01:05:30.927
I - I in my cap...

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:37.266
Come on Blake.

01:05:37.392 --> 01:05:38.477
You can do it.

01:05:38.686 --> 01:05:40.354
Something's not right.

01:05:55.744 --> 01:05:56.808
Oh no.

01:05:56.809 --> 01:05:57.872
What is she doing?

01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:59.790
- (whispers)
- What are you doing?

01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:02.543
- Just hanging out with my brother
- on Christmas Eve.

01:06:03.377 --> 01:06:04.753
Okay.

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:06.963
Where does the next verse start?

01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:11.051
When out on the lawn...

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:12.615
When out on the lawn

01:06:12.616 --> 01:06:13.970
there rose such a clatter...

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:16.577
BOTH: I sprang from my bed

01:06:16.578 --> 01:06:18.016
to see what was the matter.

01:06:19.267 --> 01:06:20.852
Away to the window,

01:06:20.853 --> 01:06:22.437
I flew like a flash,

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:24.523
tore open the shutters

01:06:24.524 --> 01:06:25.900
and threw up the sash.

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:27.547
It's working.

01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:28.777
It's working.

01:06:29.403 --> 01:06:31.405
But Cam, look.

01:06:32.573 --> 01:06:35.409
(Blake and Emma reading poem)

01:06:37.745 --> 01:06:39.351
Why is she crying?

01:06:39.352 --> 01:06:40.956
Why is she crying?

01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:42.750
It didn't work?

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:46.461
Sammy, it didn't work.

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:48.672
I guess I was wrong

01:06:48.673 --> 01:06:49.840
about her wish.

01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:51.341
So that's it?

01:06:51.342 --> 01:06:52.634
We're too late?

01:06:52.843 --> 01:06:54.678
- Really?
- We're too late?

01:06:54.887 --> 01:06:56.638
We ruined Christmas.

01:06:57.431 --> 01:06:59.140
Another Mindy mistake.

01:06:59.808 --> 01:07:01.393
Well, I guess we should head

01:07:01.394 --> 01:07:02.978
back to the North Pole.

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:05.355
We've done enough damage here.

01:07:05.564 --> 01:07:07.023
Sorry, Blake.

01:07:07.983 --> 01:07:10.360
(Blake and Emma reading poem)

01:07:10.569 --> 01:07:12.509
but I heard him explain,

01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:14.448
ere he drove out of sight.

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:16.596
Merry Christmas to all,

01:07:16.597 --> 01:07:18.535
and to all a good night.

01:07:18.744 --> 01:07:21.204
(clapping and cheering)

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:37.930
(jingle)

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:44.436
Well, that's a first.

01:07:48.023 --> 01:07:49.483
(laughing)

01:07:56.824 --> 01:07:58.742
- A hippo! A hippo!
- Yeah, you got it.

01:07:58.951 --> 01:07:59.952
- 'Kay, kay, pause
- for two seconds.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.453
- Who wants another
- hot cup of cocoa?

01:08:01.662 --> 01:08:03.079
- Me!
- Dibs on marshmallows!

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.988
Hey guys, were you guys

01:08:14.989 --> 01:08:16.635
in the basement today?

01:08:17.636 --> 01:08:18.970
No.

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:01.136
My Love,

01:09:02.221 --> 01:09:04.307
If you are reading this,

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:06.018
I guess that was the last trip

01:09:06.019 --> 01:09:07.519
to the hospital.

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:11.085
We always said I could win

01:09:11.086 --> 01:09:12.733
this fight and...

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:15.318
even though I didn't,

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:17.153
I don't think I lost.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:22.743
I had you, Emma and Blake,

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:25.746
and that makes me

01:09:25.747 --> 01:09:27.706
the luckiest man in the world.

01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:31.272
Life isn't easy

01:09:31.273 --> 01:09:32.752
by yourself, so remember

01:09:33.921 --> 01:09:36.214
you're never alone.

01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:38.300
And the four of us

01:09:38.301 --> 01:09:40.176
will always be a family.

01:09:41.929 --> 01:09:43.555
Hang up the mistletoe,

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:46.349
I'll always be under it

01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:48.184
waiting for you.

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:02.198
Mom, what's wrong?

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.936
I found another present

01:10:09.937 --> 01:10:11.291
in the basement.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:13.710
Dad's toolbox?

01:10:14.461 --> 01:10:15.629
Looks like your father

01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:16.797
left us a surprise.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:18.506
How?

01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:28.183
This one says Blake.

01:10:37.818 --> 01:10:39.069
"Dear Blake.

01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:41.113
Today, you turned three.

01:10:41.321 --> 01:10:42.635
I told your Mom that I was

01:10:42.636 --> 01:10:43.949
going to make your cake,

01:10:44.158 --> 01:10:45.367
and it turned out

01:10:45.368 --> 01:10:46.576
to be a total disaster.

01:10:46.785 --> 01:10:48.244
You didn't seem to mind.

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:49.830
You stuck your hand

01:10:49.831 --> 01:10:51.206
into the cake

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:52.749
right before we could

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:54.084
even light the candles.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:55.773
I can already tell

01:10:55.774 --> 01:10:57.253
that you are going to be

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:57.253
quite the handful.

01:10:57.921 --> 01:10:59.380
Love, Dad."

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:00.589
He was right.

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:01.883
(laughing)

01:11:04.011 --> 01:11:05.553
Mom, a postcard.

01:11:05.971 --> 01:11:07.347
From Paris?

01:11:09.432 --> 01:11:11.101
When was Dad in Paris?

01:11:11.309 --> 01:11:12.665
He went there for work when

01:11:12.666 --> 01:11:14.021
you were just a little baby.

01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:16.773
Dear Blake,

01:11:16.982 --> 01:11:18.233
Be sure to study up

01:11:18.234 --> 01:11:19.484
on your French,

01:11:19.693 --> 01:11:20.736
because when you are

01:11:20.737 --> 01:11:21.778
old enough to travel,

01:11:21.987 --> 01:11:23.301
we have to adventure through

01:11:23.302 --> 01:11:24.614
these cobblestone streets,

01:11:24.823 --> 01:11:25.949
in the most magical

01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:27.075
city in the world.

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.119
- And you'll love
- the crepes.

01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:30.745
Love, Dad.

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:32.372
Oh no - homework.

01:11:32.873 --> 01:11:34.290
(laughing)

01:11:44.968 --> 01:11:46.782
365 things I love

01:11:46.783 --> 01:11:48.596
most about Emma.

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:51.307
One for every day of the year.

01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:05.238
I love the way you laugh

01:12:05.239 --> 01:12:06.698
when we play Silly-Face-Em.

01:12:08.909 --> 01:12:10.368
What's Silly-Face-Em?

01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:12.328
A game Dad and I used to play.

01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:14.789
Like this - Graagh!

01:12:14.998 --> 01:12:16.332
(laughing)

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.002
Mom.

01:12:19.211 --> 01:12:20.461
Look.

01:12:31.306 --> 01:12:33.474
(crowd clapping)

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:35.810
Merry Christmas everyone.

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:37.437
(crowd cheering)

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:39.940
Now this year,

01:12:40.148 --> 01:12:41.524
just like last year,

01:12:41.733 --> 01:12:43.151
I'd like to dedicate

01:12:43.152 --> 01:12:44.569
this poem to my family.

01:12:45.486 --> 01:12:48.823
Laura, Emma and Blake.

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:50.032
I love you.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.618
(crowd clapping)

01:12:53.328 --> 01:12:54.913
T'was the night

01:12:54.914 --> 01:12:56.497
before Christmas

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:59.375
and all through the house,

01:12:59.584 --> 01:13:00.752
not a creature

01:13:00.753 --> 01:13:01.920
was stirring,

01:13:02.129 --> 01:13:04.547
not even a mouse.

01:13:04.756 --> 01:13:05.757
Dad was funny.

01:13:05.966 --> 01:13:08.509
Oh yes, he was.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:10.386
Merry Christmas, Mom.

01:13:12.222 --> 01:13:14.057
Merry Christmas, honey.

01:13:14.808 --> 01:13:15.808
Merry Christmas, Jingle.

01:13:15.976 --> 01:13:16.976
(barking)

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.327
Thank you, Santa.

01:13:52.804 --> 01:13:53.804
Santa.

01:13:58.268 --> 01:13:59.269
How was your flight, sir?

01:13:59.477 --> 01:14:01.771
Delightful George, thank you.

01:14:03.857 --> 01:14:05.859
Ah! Just the Elves

01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:07.861
I've been looking for.

01:14:08.069 --> 01:14:10.280
Santa, it's my fault.

01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:12.282
- I thought there must
- have been a mistake

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:13.533
About me being placed

01:14:13.534 --> 01:14:14.575
in the Mailroom,

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:15.952
so I was so careless

01:14:15.953 --> 01:14:17.120
about all the humans' wishes

01:14:18.205 --> 01:14:19.831
that I made a mistake.

01:14:20.415 --> 01:14:21.875
Mindy,

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:23.793
- I thought Benny
- assured you earlier,

01:14:24.002 --> 01:14:25.628
- There are no mistakes
- in the North Pole.

01:14:26.546 --> 01:14:27.546
But it's just that...

01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:29.132
Every job in the North Pole

01:14:29.341 --> 01:14:30.884
is as important as another.

01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:32.760
Just as each Elf

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.158
has their own

01:14:34.159 --> 01:14:35.347
important role to play.

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:37.682
I placed you

01:14:37.683 --> 01:14:38.892
in the Mailroom because

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:40.310
although you are

01:14:40.311 --> 01:14:41.519
an excellent Builder,

01:14:41.728 --> 01:14:42.938
you have a great many

01:14:42.939 --> 01:14:44.147
other talents too.

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:47.650
There was a wish this year

01:14:47.859 --> 01:14:48.881
that provided us

01:14:48.882 --> 01:14:49.903
with an opportunity

01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:51.967
to learn how to bring joy

01:14:51.968 --> 01:14:53.823
in an important new way.

01:14:55.075 --> 01:14:57.848
And I knew only the three of you

01:14:57.849 --> 01:15:00.621
would be able to fulfill it.

01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:02.436
But we didn't fulfill

01:15:02.437 --> 01:15:03.541
the last wish.

01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:05.501
(laughs)

01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:12.092
Woah guys, hey that's Blake.

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:14.010
Hi Blake.

01:15:14.219 --> 01:15:15.511
He can't hear you.

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:27.690
I can't believe

01:15:27.691 --> 01:15:28.691
we actually did it.

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:31.652
Wait, I don't get it.

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:33.529
She's still crying.

01:15:33.738 --> 01:15:35.115
Did we ruin Christmas

01:15:35.116 --> 01:15:36.491
or save it?

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:37.742
Oh Cam, look at how

01:15:37.743 --> 01:15:38.785
happy they are.

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:39.993
(nose blowing)

01:15:40.078 --> 01:15:41.537
(sniffing)

01:15:42.997 --> 01:15:44.332
Happy tears?

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.418
Who'd have thought?

01:15:46.626 --> 01:15:48.753
Regardless, it's quite clear

01:15:48.754 --> 01:15:50.880
we definitely saved Christmas.

01:15:51.631 --> 01:15:53.821
Well, technically

01:15:53.822 --> 01:15:56.010
we did ruin it first.

01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:59.639
Yes, but then we saved it.

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:01.766
I never doubted we would.

01:16:01.975 --> 01:16:03.601
Me neither.

01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:05.666
You brought more joy

01:16:05.667 --> 01:16:06.729
to the Williams family

01:16:06.938 --> 01:16:08.815
- than we ever could
- have manufactured

01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:10.775
Here in the North Pole.

01:16:11.776 --> 01:16:13.466
And so, I'm launching

01:16:13.467 --> 01:16:15.155
a new initiative.

01:16:15.363 --> 01:16:16.823
Effective immediately,

01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:18.345
undercover Elves are going

01:16:18.346 --> 01:16:19.659
to live amongst humans,

01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:22.183
to hear those wishes

01:16:22.184 --> 01:16:23.955
that often go unheard

01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:25.623
and facilitate the act

01:16:25.624 --> 01:16:26.874
of fulfilling those wishes,

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:30.253
365 days of the year.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.317
Happiness levels will

01:16:32.318 --> 01:16:33.714
go through the roof.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.675
Now Mindy,

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:38.094
- would you still like
- to be transferred

01:16:38.303 --> 01:16:39.595
To the Builders' Workshop?

01:16:42.223 --> 01:16:43.558
Or...

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.061
might I be able to convince

01:16:46.062 --> 01:16:47.354
the three of you

01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:48.688
to join our exciting

01:16:48.689 --> 01:16:49.814
new initiative?

01:16:50.023 --> 01:16:51.023
Yes.

01:16:51.065 --> 01:16:52.065
Oh my.

01:16:53.151 --> 01:16:54.590
I can still build

01:16:54.591 --> 01:16:56.029
part-time though, right?

01:16:57.405 --> 01:16:58.739
Perhaps

01:16:59.366 --> 01:17:00.992
- we should adopt
- a human tradition

01:17:01.201 --> 01:17:02.828
And make the North Pole

01:17:02.829 --> 01:17:04.454
a little more festive.

01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:05.684
Human Expert.

01:17:05.685 --> 01:17:06.706
Leave it to me.

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:09.709
Oh, and one more thing.

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.586
Will someone please show me what

01:17:11.587 --> 01:17:13.254
this Moo Cow game is all about?

01:17:13.463 --> 01:17:15.631
(laughing)

01:17:16.341 --> 01:17:18.676
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho...

01:17:26.518 --> 01:17:28.936
(beatbox Christmas music)

01:17:30.397 --> 01:17:32.106
Are you two still dancing?

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:37.007
Must... dance...

01:17:37.008 --> 01:17:39.697
my sadness... away.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:41.491
Everything's okay.

01:17:41.699 --> 01:17:43.284
- Christmas wasn't
- ruined after all.

01:17:43.493 --> 01:17:45.286
That's another on time.

01:17:45.912 --> 01:17:47.643
Well sort of on time Christmas

01:17:47.644 --> 01:17:49.374
for the Time Elves.

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:53.044
Oh... good...

01:18:08.142 --> 01:18:09.477
Cut!

01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:16.797
Big smiles, guys.

01:18:16.798 --> 01:18:17.944
Big smiles.

01:18:20.905 --> 01:18:22.740
- We could probably
- use the help.

01:18:26.578 --> 01:18:28.162
It is delicious.

01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:29.830
Careful it's hot.

01:18:31.249 --> 01:18:33.084
(laughing)

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:36.879
I know-wha!

01:18:46.097 --> 01:18:47.474
Woah!

01:18:57.525 --> 01:18:58.776
(laughing)

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:07.785
(laughing)

01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:12.165
It's her face! I need to

01:19:12.166 --> 01:19:13.541
stop looking at her face!

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:17.253
Are you going to eat that?

01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:20.756
Are you going to eat that?

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:24.427
Are you going to eat that?

01:19:27.221 --> 01:19:28.764
Are you going to eat that?

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:31.518
(laughing)

01:19:31.976 --> 01:19:33.769
(laughing)

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:41.902
Mail.

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:45.406
(laughing)

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:48.576
Mail.

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:53.247
Has this ever happened before?

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:56.000
- Sorry!
- I was...

01:19:58.294 --> 01:19:59.587
I got it!

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:07.803
BOTH: Letters!

01:20:09.681 --> 01:20:10.890
MINDY:

01:20:10.891 --> 01:20:12.099
Sorry. Totally messed that up.

01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:13.643
BOTH: Letters!

01:20:19.315 --> 01:20:21.526
Ahhhh.

01:20:21.735 --> 01:20:23.152
Sorry, that was really bad.

01:20:31.118 --> 01:20:32.453
Yeah,

01:20:32.662 --> 01:20:34.268
but, Slanta has already

01:20:34.269 --> 01:20:35.873
left on his sleigh.

01:20:36.082 --> 01:20:37.875
- And we're too late
- for the workshop.

01:20:38.376 --> 01:20:39.460
(laughing)

01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:40.836
Slanta?

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.841
Oh no.

01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:47.927
What am I going to do now?

01:20:48.135 --> 01:20:49.345
Father Christmas.

01:20:49.554 --> 01:20:51.138
- (smashing sound)
- Oh!

01:20:52.557 --> 01:20:54.016
That was really bad.

01:20:56.269 --> 01:20:57.269
Hi.

01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:58.854
Hi!

01:21:04.778 --> 01:21:06.862
I forgot to try to hug him!

01:21:09.907 --> 01:21:11.743
- Three!
- Wishes!

01:21:11.951 --> 01:21:13.494
Merry Christmas!

01:21:20.835 --> 01:21:21.899
Just a few Ho Ho Ho's,

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:22.962
you'll be good to go.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:32.639
(laughing)

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:35.683
Who's following you?

01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:38.894
Is that my sweater?

01:21:41.188 --> 01:21:42.523
(laughing)

01:23:25.084 --> 01:23:28.045
