00:46.480 --> 00:51.217
<i>Ancient feudal Japan,
a land shrouded in mystery,</i>

00:51.218 --> 00:53.252
<i>forbidden to foreigners.</i>

00:53.253 --> 00:57.165
<i>A group of magical islands
home to witches and demons.</i>

00:58.158 --> 01:00.226
<i>A nation of rival provinces</i>

01:00.227 --> 01:04.798
<i>whose lords were ruled by a
shogun whose will is absolute.</i>

01:06.533 --> 01:09.569
<i>Peace in the realm is
kept by the samurai,</i>

01:09.570 --> 01:11.671
<i>master swordsmen</i>

01:11.672 --> 01:13.606
<i>tasked with protecting their lord</i>

01:13.607 --> 01:15.778
<i>and their province at all costs.</i>

01:16.710 --> 01:19.845
<i>Should a samurai ever
lose or fail his master,</i>

01:19.846 --> 01:24.050
<i>he suffers the greatest shame
in all Japanese society.</i>

01:24.051 --> 01:26.290
<i>He becomes a ronin.</i>

01:27.754 --> 01:30.890
<i>And yet, to know the
story of the 47 Ronin,</i>

01:30.891 --> 01:33.528
<i>is to know the story of all Japan.</i>

01:36.730 --> 01:39.003
<i>It began with a boy.</i>

01:40.934 --> 01:45.141
<i>No one knew where he came from
or how he found his way to Ako.</i>

01:46.540 --> 01:49.314
<i>Some said he was a changeling,
no better than a beast.</i>

01:54.081 --> 01:56.388
<i>Many believed he'd been
raised by the Tengu,</i>

01:58.051 --> 02:00.188
<i>the demons of the forest</i>

02:01.054 --> 02:03.327
<i>who had taught him
their dark powers</i>

02:03.390 --> 02:05.663
<i>and trained him in their
lethal arts of killing.</i>

02:10.297 --> 02:13.708
<i>The evil he had fled had
left its mark upon him.</i>

02:28.181 --> 02:29.783
Oishi!

02:30.417 --> 02:32.758
My Lord, it is a demon.

02:43.630 --> 02:47.542
He's a child, just like you.

02:48.802 --> 02:51.314
Help me pick him up, Oishi.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.880
<i>Lord Asano, of the province Ako,</i>

02:56.276 --> 02:58.444
<i>saved him that day,</i>

02:58.445 --> 03:02.254
<i>seeing something in the
boy that Oishi did not.</i>

03:07.454 --> 03:12.060
<i>Lord Asano's daughter,
Mike, saw it too.</i>

03:29.142 --> 03:32.578
<i>Mika's father allowed the
boy to live amongst them,</i>

03:32.579 --> 03:34.750
<i>against the advice of his samurai.</i>

03:38.018 --> 03:39.188
Look.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.624
What do you see?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.323
A branch?

03:43.990 --> 03:45.091
No.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.305
It's a deer.

03:49.596 --> 03:50.696
Oh.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.003
It took this path.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.653
You keep it, Kai.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.848
<i>The samurai believed his presence</i>

04:08.849 --> 04:11.020
<i>would bring misfortune
to their land.</i>

04:13.220 --> 04:15.732
<i>Mika only saw a gentle boy.</i>

04:18.257 --> 04:20.226
<i>Although he lived as an outcast,</i>

04:20.226 --> 04:22.428
<i>Kai was determined
to repay the love</i>

04:22.429 --> 04:25.097
he received from
Mike and her father,

04:25.098 --> 04:26.541
<i>whatever the cost.</i>

04:42.048 --> 04:43.559
Kai.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.428
Well?

04:50.490 --> 04:52.170
There is something wrong
with the creature.

04:52.292 --> 04:56.340
It's up there on the rise, but
it will come down again to hunt.

04:56.429 --> 04:59.032
It would be safer to set a
trap and wait for it here.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.414
It's up on the rise, Lord Asano.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.164
My Lord.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.403
Kill it!

08:43.990 --> 08:49.665
I would rather have been killed by
that beast than saved by a half-breed.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.246
Yasuno!

09:19.259 --> 09:23.034
Ako owes you a great debt, Yasuno.

09:23.096 --> 09:26.609
We can finally welcome
the Shogun without fear.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.489
For Ako!

09:41.581 --> 09:43.126
For Ako!

09:44.217 --> 09:45.625
Well done.

10:35.835 --> 10:36.936
Get out.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.343
Get out!

11:02.529 --> 11:04.768
Does Lord Asano live?

11:07.800 --> 11:08.935
Yes.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.540
Mmm.

11:27.053 --> 11:28.954
Hosting the Shogun's tournament

11:28.955 --> 11:30.789
is a great honor for my father.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.597
Everything must be perfect.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.796
My Lady, Mika.

11:35.461 --> 11:37.563
Lord Asano and the hunting
party have returned.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.505
They killed the beast.

11:55.815 --> 11:56.916
Father!

11:59.152 --> 12:00.697
I was worried.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.200
The hunt took longer than we hoped.

12:03.823 --> 12:06.267
Yasuno showed great courage.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.763
Is anyone badly hurt?

12:11.898 --> 12:13.944
Who are you looking for?

12:20.406 --> 12:23.282
Is everything prepared for
the Shogun's arrival?

12:24.777 --> 12:26.185
Yes, Father.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.851
I want all of Ako
to share in this honor

12:32.852 --> 12:35.626
of hosting our great commander.

12:36.022 --> 12:37.556
I have made special arrangements

12:37.557 --> 12:39.398
for the visiting lords, as well.

12:45.465 --> 12:49.138
I've ordered stands put
up all along the route.

12:51.037 --> 12:53.083
Your mother would have been proud.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.495
I was worried.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.501
You always worry.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.502
He so wants your approval.

13:23.069 --> 13:26.412
Chikara has been training
every chance he gets.

13:38.918 --> 13:41.692
My Lady, Kai has returned.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.155
They told me you were hurt.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.232
It's nothing, My Lady.

14:21.327 --> 14:22.735
Your back.

14:26.632 --> 14:27.733
Sit down.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.819
Someone should have
seen to this before.

14:47.854 --> 14:48.989
Thank you.

14:56.429 --> 15:00.636
I saw the shame in Yasuno's eyes
when they were praising him.

15:02.001 --> 15:05.639
Even when you try to help
them, they hate you.

15:06.372 --> 15:10.215
Your father's samurai have always
treated me as well as can be expected.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.783
And is that all you expect?

15:15.281 --> 15:16.792
It's all I know.

15:19.018 --> 15:21.462
It doesn't have to be, Kai.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.366
This is no place for you, My Lady.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.710
Are you sending me away?

15:40.273 --> 15:43.141
Look at me and tell
me you don't love me.

15:43.142 --> 15:44.585
I will always love you.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.748
But you have your place

15:48.714 --> 15:50.521
and I have mine.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.930
Asano <i>Takumi no Kami,</i> ruler of Ako.

17:02.788 --> 17:05.123
His Highness, Shogun Tokugawa,

17:05.124 --> 17:08.933
lord of provinces and
master of all Japan

17:09.362 --> 17:11.806
thanks you for your welcome.

17:12.330 --> 17:13.773
Lord Asano,

17:14.700 --> 17:16.507
my friend.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.009
Ako is magnificent,

17:19.204 --> 17:20.909
as always.

17:21.374 --> 17:26.685
We anticipate with pleasure
tomorrows tournament.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.617
Great Shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi...

17:45.398 --> 17:48.600
and hope the entertainment
we have prepared

17:48.601 --> 17:50.703
meets your august approval.

17:54.674 --> 17:55.844
Father.

17:57.176 --> 17:59.051
What are you doing in my home?

18:00.346 --> 18:02.448
Last week at the hunt I saw a fox.

18:03.115 --> 18:06.219
I didn't realize at the
time that it was a witch.

18:06.552 --> 18:08.119
A witch?

18:08.120 --> 18:11.056
I believe I saw the same
creature again tonight.

18:11.057 --> 18:14.195
She was in human form among
the nobles' concubines.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.664
My Lord.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.705
They say only demons have the power

18:26.706 --> 18:29.343
to see past a witch's disguise.

18:32.211 --> 18:33.915
Are you a demon?

18:35.881 --> 18:36.982
No.

18:39.385 --> 18:43.160
Then I suggest you are simply
bewitched by a beautiful girl.

18:56.235 --> 19:00.511
Lord Asano, may we
present Lord Kira Yoshinaka,

19:00.573 --> 19:03.847
master of Nagato, from
the northern provinces.

19:16.822 --> 19:20.563
Ako is as beautiful as I
remember, Lord Asano.

19:21.260 --> 19:23.863
We are honored by your
visit, Lord Kira.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.872
I look forward to the tournament.

19:41.180 --> 19:45.888
I had no idea your concubine
was so lovely, Lord Asano.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.063
She's my daughter.

19:51.457 --> 19:52.558
Oh.

19:52.658 --> 19:54.669
Forgive me, My Lady.

19:56.829 --> 19:59.239
May I ask that your
daughter sit with us?

19:59.732 --> 20:02.438
I should like to make
up for my rudeness.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.147
Father, who is that?

21:20.913 --> 21:22.492
My fighter.

21:28.921 --> 21:32.332
I'm sure your father's champion
will be an even contest.

21:34.393 --> 21:35.699
Yasuno.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.835
Yasuno. Yasuno!

21:43.068 --> 21:44.169
Yasuno!

21:48.774 --> 21:49.875
What's wrong with him?

21:51.010 --> 21:52.248
Witchcraft

21:52.745 --> 21:53.846
Get your father.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.852
There is no time.

22:02.288 --> 22:03.731
If we have no fighter,

22:04.123 --> 22:05.896
Ako will be disgraced.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.302
Only a samurai can fight.

22:19.305 --> 22:20.406
Enough.

22:23.375 --> 22:24.647
Your fighter?

23:01.747 --> 23:04.293
Champions, prepare for combat!

23:05.484 --> 23:06.927
Bring them steel!

24:07.446 --> 24:08.991
Stop!

24:38.410 --> 24:41.354
You are not a samurai.

24:45.351 --> 24:46.759
Kill it.

24:48.253 --> 24:49.354
No!

24:49.989 --> 24:51.227
No!

24:54.927 --> 24:56.938
Forgive me, My Lord.

24:57.262 --> 25:00.070
The fault is mine.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.059
Strip him of his armor.

25:17.983 --> 25:19.426
Beat him.

26:14.440 --> 26:15.541
Stop!

26:20.045 --> 26:21.215
I'm sorry.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.019
My Lord!

26:28.587 --> 26:29.961
Not now!

26:32.224 --> 26:33.803
Father, please!

26:54.480 --> 26:57.993
Lord Asano's mind is unsettled.

26:58.917 --> 27:01.657
It is time to take Ako.

27:02.154 --> 27:06.498
It is what you hoped for, it
is what we have planned for.

27:07.259 --> 27:09.737
What are you afraid of, My Lord?

27:12.764 --> 27:14.935
Show me your courage.

27:15.834 --> 27:18.210
Give me your heart.

27:19.738 --> 27:23.081
After this, there
is no turning back.

27:23.942 --> 27:28.013
You are bound to me, and I to you.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.587
Rivers of blood

27:35.487 --> 27:37.965
and mountains of corpses

27:38.757 --> 27:41.565
will not stand in our way.

27:42.528 --> 27:45.370
Nor the tears of widows.

27:45.764 --> 27:49.437
Find your envy and hatred.

27:51.203 --> 27:55.911
And I will give you all you desire.

29:26.131 --> 29:27.335
Father.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.046
Father!

29:35.474 --> 29:37.315
Father!

29:41.647 --> 29:43.158
Mika.

29:45.050 --> 29:46.151
Father!

29:47.452 --> 29:48.929
Mika.

29:50.088 --> 29:51.258
Father!

29:59.331 --> 30:01.001
Father!

30:01.667 --> 30:02.837
Help!

30:14.346 --> 30:15.550
What is this?

30:16.581 --> 30:17.748
Stand back!

30:17.749 --> 30:18.850
My Lord!

30:19.785 --> 30:21.091
Please!

30:23.855 --> 30:25.025
Father!

30:40.839 --> 30:42.941
Everyone, go back to your posts!

31:03.895 --> 31:06.566
The law is clear.

31:06.898 --> 31:11.003
You have struck an unarmed guest
and have shamed your home.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.313
The penalty is death.

31:14.506 --> 31:18.452
Because of your rank and the
service you have done Ako,

31:18.543 --> 31:22.819
I will allow you to regain your
honor and the honor of your house

31:22.981 --> 31:25.083
through seppuku,

31:25.217 --> 31:27.695
death by your own hand,

31:28.320 --> 31:33.267
so that you may show courage
and dignity in death

31:34.559 --> 31:36.866
as you once showed in life.

31:40.499 --> 31:44.706
The Shogun could have had
me hanged like a criminal.

31:46.505 --> 31:50.348
Instead, he has allowed me

31:51.176 --> 31:54.849
to take my life with honor.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.485
You were bewitched, My Lord.

31:59.217 --> 32:00.819
Your mind was poisoned.

32:01.353 --> 32:04.662
If I accept my fate,

32:05.857 --> 32:10.133
no one will question the
honor of our people

32:10.228 --> 32:12.968
or punish them for my crime.

32:14.466 --> 32:15.567
Promise me

32:17.035 --> 32:21.811
you will protect Mika and
Ako from our enemies.

32:22.207 --> 32:23.650
My Lord.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.549
I am ready, Oishi.

32:31.550 --> 32:32.822
And when I die,

32:33.218 --> 32:37.926
I would be honored if you
would act as my second,

32:38.990 --> 32:40.694
my friend.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.015
Father!

33:03.682 --> 33:05.955
Don't let them see you cry.

35:23.388 --> 35:24.762
No.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.031
We must have revenge.

35:29.227 --> 35:31.929
Whatever the cost, it is our duty.

35:31.930 --> 35:34.510
My Lord, what will you have us do?

35:39.738 --> 35:42.512
If we fight now, we die.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.943
And not just us.

35:45.944 --> 35:49.116
Every farmer and villager
in Ako will be killed.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.590
We have to think of them first.

36:01.426 --> 36:04.769
Poison, My Lady.
It will end your pain.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.373
We have not lost Ako yet.

36:44.335 --> 36:45.675
Your Highness.

37:13.164 --> 37:14.538
Lady Asano,

37:16.668 --> 37:19.305
I am sorry for your father's death.

37:19.437 --> 37:21.772
He accepted it with dignity.

37:21.773 --> 37:25.876
Your Highness, as my
father's only child,

37:25.877 --> 37:30.790
I ask that I may look after his
lands until such time as I marry.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.960
I have already considered
this, My Lady.

37:44.529 --> 37:47.598
So that there will be no
feud between your clans,

37:47.599 --> 37:50.339
I decree that from this day,

37:50.735 --> 37:52.337
they will be one.

37:53.138 --> 37:56.981
Sealed by the marriage bond
between you and Lord Kira.

37:57.642 --> 38:00.154
You are granted one year to mourn.

38:00.378 --> 38:04.858
But you will remain a guest of
Lord Kira's until you are married.

38:04.949 --> 38:06.050
Oishi.

38:09.220 --> 38:10.993
You are now ronin.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.160
Masterless samurai.

38:15.660 --> 38:19.503
I forbid you to seek vengeance
for Lord Asano's death.

38:21.499 --> 38:22.600
Lord Kira,

38:23.668 --> 38:26.510
I leave Ako with you.

38:45.190 --> 38:49.693
From this moment on, you are
banished from these lands.

38:49.694 --> 38:52.434
Those who remain
will be hunted down

38:54.265 --> 38:56.470
and executed.

39:12.450 --> 39:16.828
You will never see him again,
My Lady. Take a last look.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.653
I don't trust Oishi.

39:49.654 --> 39:52.496
He no longer has the
protection of his rank.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.159
Throw him in the pit.

39:54.592 --> 39:56.330
Break his will.

41:02.327 --> 41:03.497
Father!

41:04.562 --> 41:05.663
Father.

41:06.931 --> 41:09.099
Get away! Get away from me.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.180
Chikara, help him up.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.860
Where are my men?

41:28.353 --> 41:30.194
They have all left Ako.

41:31.589 --> 41:33.430
And Lady Asano?

41:34.759 --> 41:37.806
Her time of mourning
is almost over.

41:38.863 --> 41:41.136
Lord Kira took her to his castle

41:41.165 --> 41:43.438
to begin preparing
for their wedding.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.037
Chikara,

41:48.006 --> 41:50.382
what of the half-breed?

41:51.442 --> 41:56.651
Kira's men took him to the Dutch
island and sold him into slavery.

42:09.627 --> 42:11.229
We need three horses.

42:13.498 --> 42:14.736
Now.

42:24.976 --> 42:26.077
Riku.

42:29.647 --> 42:33.991
You must make the whole world
believe you've divorced me.

42:35.887 --> 42:39.696
It is the only way to protect
you from what I have to do.

42:42.326 --> 42:47.933
No one but you and I
can know that you are,

42:47.999 --> 42:50.045
and will always be,

42:52.837 --> 42:54.780
the joy of my life.

42:57.942 --> 43:00.613
I am the wife of a samurai.

43:03.347 --> 43:07.122
Whatever your duty is,
it is mine too.

43:17.862 --> 43:18.963
Show them this

43:19.730 --> 43:22.834
and tell them to meet me at
the black lake in a week.

43:23.801 --> 43:27.542
Remember, the enemy
will be watching.

44:10.014 --> 44:12.060
Hey, stranger.

44:14.452 --> 44:16.031
What's your business here?

44:17.955 --> 44:20.035
I'm looking for a half-breed.

44:26.797 --> 44:28.706
Good luck, samurai!

45:07.305 --> 45:09.839
Half-breed! Half-breed! Half-breed!

45:42.873 --> 45:44.452
Kai!

45:49.013 --> 45:50.456
It's Oishi.

45:52.516 --> 45:53.617
Kai!

46:01.759 --> 46:02.860
It's me!

46:17.041 --> 46:19.553
Kai! Lady Asano.

46:20.311 --> 46:21.412
Mika.

46:23.614 --> 46:25.489
She needs your help.

46:30.721 --> 46:32.994
Half-breed! Half-breed! Half-breed!

46:34.458 --> 46:38.062
Kai! Soon Kira will marry Mika.

46:38.129 --> 46:40.505
We must stop him!
Are you with me?

47:01.819 --> 47:03.455
Now!

48:13.090 --> 48:15.761
Lady Asano is to be
married in a week.

48:16.394 --> 48:18.098
What do you care?

48:18.262 --> 48:20.774
When Kira took her away,
you were on your knees.

48:21.165 --> 48:24.371
We would have all been killed.
You too.

48:25.035 --> 48:27.012
What use are you to her dead?

48:27.872 --> 48:29.974
What use am I to you?

48:33.010 --> 48:37.115
Either follow me or go
back to what you were.

48:37.181 --> 48:38.848
Don't turn your back on me, ronin.

48:40.785 --> 48:42.387
Follow you for what?

48:47.558 --> 48:50.639
Kira has 1,000 men
under his command.

48:51.729 --> 48:56.141
He's also protected by witchcraft.

48:57.701 --> 48:59.536
When I told you that,
you turned me away.

48:59.537 --> 49:00.638
I was wrong.

49:03.374 --> 49:05.351
I failed my lord.

49:09.747 --> 49:12.259
I don't know who or what you are,

49:13.751 --> 49:15.853
but I need your help.

49:26.063 --> 49:27.198
Clothes.

49:46.517 --> 49:47.960
I'll come with you,

49:48.018 --> 49:51.031
but if you ever kneel before
Kira again, I'll take your head.

50:02.099 --> 50:04.201
Where did you learn
to fight like that?

50:05.102 --> 50:06.545
From demons.

50:51.715 --> 50:53.920
My Lord, forgive me.

50:53.984 --> 50:56.928
The half-breed has escaped
from the Dutch island.

50:57.555 --> 50:59.657
They say a samurai helped him.

51:03.661 --> 51:05.035
Oishi.

51:17.074 --> 51:20.678
Find Oishi. I need him dead.

51:41.732 --> 51:43.209
Yasuno, it's Oishi!

51:45.636 --> 51:46.874
He's back!

51:46.904 --> 51:48.184
Everyone, Oishi's back!

51:48.305 --> 51:50.009
Oishi's back!

52:05.823 --> 52:06.889
Father.

52:06.890 --> 52:08.060
Well done, Chikara.

52:26.644 --> 52:28.883
Today we may be ronin,

52:29.647 --> 52:32.956
but now the time has come.

52:33.851 --> 52:37.364
What I propose ends in death.

52:39.323 --> 52:41.096
Even if we succeed,

52:41.525 --> 52:47.303
we will be hanged as criminals
for defying the Shogun's orders.

52:51.635 --> 52:53.715
I take a vow before you

52:54.471 --> 52:58.485
that I will not rest
until justice is done,

52:59.677 --> 53:02.917
will not sleep until our
master lies in peace,

53:03.547 --> 53:05.058
and will not pray

53:05.449 --> 53:09.326
unless it is to ask the
heavens' forgiveness

53:09.386 --> 53:11.397
for sending Kira to hell!

53:26.870 --> 53:28.643
There are only two ways in.

53:28.839 --> 53:30.509
The main gate here

53:30.641 --> 53:33.085
and this point beneath
the west wall.

53:33.677 --> 53:35.415
Both are heavily guarded.

53:35.479 --> 53:39.994
Our best chance is to strike when Kira
leaves the safety of his fortress.

53:40.084 --> 53:44.155
He will travel to his ancestors'
shrine to offer prayers.

53:44.655 --> 53:47.090
We don't know yet when he
will make the journey.

53:47.091 --> 53:51.327
Isogai, you ride ahead
to his temple town

53:51.328 --> 53:52.839
and see what you can find out.

53:53.397 --> 53:56.000
Remember, even near holy sites

53:56.100 --> 53:59.875
there are brothels and plenty of
loose-tongued officials who visit them.

54:00.537 --> 54:04.483
Even if we know the route, we
will need more men for an ambush.

54:04.541 --> 54:06.518
Then we'll get them.

54:06.577 --> 54:08.850
You and Chuzaemon and Okuda

54:08.912 --> 54:11.856
will gather as many of our
former samurai as you can

54:11.915 --> 54:14.996
and meet us here at a farmhouse
Horibe has found for us.

54:16.186 --> 54:21.133
Forgive me, sir, but how can we
succeed without good swords?

54:22.192 --> 54:23.327
Take mine.

54:23.861 --> 54:27.738
When we meet again, I'll
have more waiting for you.

54:29.533 --> 54:32.307
The rest of us will go to Uetsu.

54:32.369 --> 54:34.847
The finest swordmakers
in the land work there.

54:35.205 --> 54:36.807
Why is the half-breed here?

54:39.777 --> 54:41.879
I asked him to come.

54:42.045 --> 54:44.557
We can't take him with us.
He's not a samurai.

54:50.053 --> 54:52.895
None of us are samurai anymore.

55:51.949 --> 55:53.653
Who are you?

55:54.451 --> 55:57.054
We are farmers from Shimobe, sir.

55:57.788 --> 55:59.629
We have come to buy tools.

55:59.957 --> 56:02.799
This is Lord Kira's village now.

56:20.644 --> 56:23.122
These are not farmer's hands.

56:55.545 --> 56:58.148
Take the swords,
whatever you can salvage.

56:59.082 --> 57:00.786
We'll need more.

57:02.686 --> 57:03.992
Help him.

57:13.797 --> 57:15.968
Eat, My Lady.

57:27.711 --> 57:30.382
You think I care if you starve?

57:31.048 --> 57:34.322
Soon my lord will be
ruler of all Japan

57:35.052 --> 57:38.497
and you can take your life
like your father did.

57:38.822 --> 57:40.663
You killed my father.

57:41.491 --> 57:44.435
Weren't you the one
who broke his heart?

57:45.562 --> 57:48.336
You betrayed him with your lust.

58:05.749 --> 58:10.025
We can go to Hida.
They will give us weapons.

58:11.088 --> 58:12.758
You will find nothing in Hida.

58:13.357 --> 58:16.461
Kira's men will have taken
over this entire region.

58:17.327 --> 58:18.770
There is another way.

58:21.598 --> 58:24.042
You will find swords
in the Sea of Trees.

58:25.268 --> 58:26.711
The Tengu Forest

58:29.139 --> 58:31.048
That is just a myth.

58:32.442 --> 58:33.953
I've seen them.

58:54.398 --> 58:56.569
How do you know about
the Tengu Forest?

58:57.801 --> 59:01.144
I was raised there
before I fled to Ako.

59:02.672 --> 59:04.843
Those scars on your head.

59:05.075 --> 59:07.587
Are they the ones who marked you?

59:08.812 --> 59:09.947
Yes.

59:10.547 --> 59:12.149
And taught you to fight?

59:12.215 --> 59:14.022
To kill.

59:14.084 --> 59:16.186
They have many strange
and magical ways

59:16.219 --> 59:18.321
to protect themselves
and their beliefs.

59:20.424 --> 59:24.336
They wanted to show me that this
life has nothing to offer but death.

59:26.396 --> 59:30.603
They wanted me to be like
them and renounce the world.

59:31.668 --> 59:35.306
I vowed never to use the
magical powers they taught me.

59:35.372 --> 59:40.148
Although I was still a child, I knew
my place was among other men.

59:41.945 --> 59:45.822
And do you think that these
Tengu would give us weapons?

59:48.718 --> 59:50.661
They will test our will.

01:00:12.042 --> 01:00:14.918
My wife just won't stop nagging me.

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:18.992
She wants me to find her the best
view of Lord Kim's procession.

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:21.390
Procession? What procession?

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:24.191
Nobody knows when Kira
will leave his fortress,

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:25.890
not even his own guards.

01:00:26.056 --> 01:00:28.864
He will hurry back
before anyone is awake.

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:41.606
What is your name?

01:00:41.905 --> 01:00:43.211
Yuki.

01:00:44.074 --> 01:00:46.677
Where do you come from, Yuki?

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:05.198
You've come back.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.878
Are we lost?

01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:17.382
No. They know we're here.

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.511
What is that noise?

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:23.613
Ghosts.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:28.124
Spirits of the old and infirm
who are left hereto die.

01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:32.833
Unwanted children, too.

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:08.266
Only you.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.228
I'm coming with you.

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:13.364
No.

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:17.134
Do as he says.

01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:20.373
Stay here.

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:51.335
Whatever happens in there,
whatever you see,

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:53.977
don't draw your weapon.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.331
Wait here.

01:03:25.068 --> 01:03:28.445
How do we know the half-breed
hasn't led him into a trap?

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:30.046
Oishi trusts him.

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:34.177
Of course, he has no choice.
We need weapons.

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:39.356
If he doesn't come back soon,

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:43.225
I'm going after him.

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:22.225
So the terrified boy
returns as a man.

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:26.304
I have come for your help.

01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:28.675
We are in need of swords.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.468
Then take it.

01:04:34.471 --> 01:04:39.179
These swords were forged to defend
us against the hatred of men.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:43.651
Men who persecuted
us for our beliefs.

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:47.750
The same men who despise
you for being different.

01:04:49.853 --> 01:04:52.490
And now you're here to help them.

01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:54.958
They are good men.

01:04:55.024 --> 01:04:56.603
Their cause is just.

01:04:58.428 --> 01:05:01.338
Many come for our steel,

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:04.274
but none return.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:08.843
You told him not to draw his sword.

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:12.211
If he does,

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:16.455
he and all his men will die.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:24.063
Was it worth it? What you
found in the outside world?

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:28.825
The love of a woman
you can never have?

01:05:29.726 --> 01:05:30.827
Yes.

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:36.634
Let me tell you of love, Kai.

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.809
The love of one night

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:41.313
that brought you into this world.

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:46.553
An English sailor
and a peasant girl.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:53.058
Your loving mother abandoned
you to die in these woods.

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:56.560
A monster, a half-breed child.

01:05:58.087 --> 01:06:00.030
Yet we found you,

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:04.161
accepted you, trained you.

01:06:06.763 --> 01:06:08.706
We taught you many things.

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:11.576
But you fled

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:14.838
and you turned your
back on those gifts.

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:17.342
Gifts of death.

01:06:17.407 --> 01:06:19.009
No matter what you do,

01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:23.619
Mika will never be
yours in this life.

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:29.686
Then I will go to my death and
pray I find her in the next.

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:33.356
Sir?

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:41.872
What are you doing here?

01:06:42.265 --> 01:06:44.140
I told you to stay.

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.080
No! Yasuno!

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:05.729
<i>Draw your sword.</i>

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.734
<i>Save them.</i>

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:14.331
<i>Draw your sword.</i>

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:18.074
<i>Save them.</i>

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:22.174
<i>Draw your sword.</i>

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:27.447
<i>Save your men!</i>

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:34.760
No more talk.

01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:38.424
Will you give me what I ask?

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:41.658
Take the blade, Kai.

01:07:41.925 --> 01:07:43.868
If you can reach it before me.

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:50.133
<i>Save your men. Help them.</i>

01:08:00.043 --> 01:08:02.123
<i>Draw your sword, Oishi.</i>

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:07.316
<i>Save them.</i>

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.191
Chikara!

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:29.247
A gift not forgotten.

01:08:48.992 --> 01:08:51.231
You passed their test.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:53.100
Your men are safe.

01:08:53.997 --> 01:08:56.008
You've got your swords.

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:12.455
What's so special
about these swords?

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.287
What do they do?

01:09:15.917 --> 01:09:17.258
It depends.

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:19.192
On what?

01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:21.761
Who uses them.

01:09:22.792 --> 01:09:28.934
What about a tall, strong,
brave man like me?

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:37.716
They cut.

01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:56.934
I think mine is broken.

01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:22.752
Your sword.

01:10:22.852 --> 01:10:25.933
You keep it, Hazama.
I told you we'd bring others.

01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:42.276
I have the information
you requested.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:45.846
Lord Kira leaves for his
ancestors' shrine tonight.

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.045
Well done.

01:10:49.112 --> 01:10:51.954
Come, Isogai. Gather the men.

01:10:52.515 --> 01:10:53.855
Father.

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:57.297
I want to go with you.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.121
No.

01:10:59.522 --> 01:11:01.624
Horibe, stay with him.

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:38.237
I ride to my ancestors' shrine
to offer thanks for our wedding.

01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:41.035
Is there anything you
wish me to pray for?

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:44.538
My Lord will not like my answer.

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:47.438
You may look down on me, My Lady,

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:51.579
but our children and their
children will be of one blood.

01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:18.368
Take care, Hazama.

01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:48.106
Sorry.

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:54.803
It's a trap! Go! Go!

01:12:54.804 --> 01:12:57.316
Get back! Get back!

01:12:58.641 --> 01:12:59.776
Get out!

01:13:16.826 --> 01:13:17.927
Yasuno!

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:20.830
Yasuno!

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:39.952
Oishi, help me!
It's Basho.

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:41.853
Hazama!

01:13:51.394 --> 01:13:52.495
- No!
- Oishi!

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:32.240
It belonged to Oishi, My Lord.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:50.628
Your half-breed is dead.

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:58.564
So are dozens of your father's men.

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:02.534
All killed

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:04.904
trying to save you.

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:12.880
Perhaps now you understand

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:15.780
the price of your love.

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.791
I promised my lord

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:27.961
I would not harm

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:31.595
a hair on your head.

01:15:38.134 --> 01:15:42.182
But what you do to yourself

01:15:42.972 --> 01:15:46.076
is not my concern.

01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:06.531
Good night.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.022
Kai.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.826
I have a confession to make.

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:07.388
When I was a boy,

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:11.665
I used to wait in the
woods outside your hut,

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.671
and when you came out,

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:20.109
I'd throw stones at you,

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:22.439
then hide.

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:28.121
I knew it was you.

01:17:28.911 --> 01:17:32.083
I could see your belly sticking
out from behind the trees.

01:17:43.526 --> 01:17:44.969
I'm sorry, Kai.

01:17:46.095 --> 01:17:48.197
You're a good man.

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:20.232
I should have acted the
day Lord Asano died.

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:24.741
Our anger should have
been sudden and swift.

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:29.181
Then even if we'd failed,

01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:34.479
it would have been with honor.

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:48.991
You are samurai.

01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:54.765
We still have swords and
the advantage of surprise.

01:18:56.265 --> 01:18:58.606
Kira thinks we're ghosts.

01:18:59.602 --> 01:19:02.649
We can use that,
turn it to our advantage.

01:19:04.206 --> 01:19:05.979
He'll never expect us.

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:11.181
We can still do what we came for.

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:35.907
Eat.

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.983
- Your arm?
- Fine.

01:19:56.392 --> 01:19:57.527
Go get your father.

01:20:14.977 --> 01:20:16.078
Stay where you are!

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:21.616
What is this?

01:20:21.617 --> 01:20:25.927
We are not some village troupe
to be held up by bandits.

01:20:26.088 --> 01:20:29.965
Lord Kira himself has hired us
to perform at his wedding.

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:33.194
I have the letters and
passes to prove it.

01:20:33.195 --> 01:20:34.433
There is no need.

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:37.411
We saw you perform in Ako.

01:20:40.803 --> 01:20:42.974
You are Lord Asano's men.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.710
We need your help.

01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:53.482
Kai.

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:05.960
Forgive me for not thanking
you for defeating the beast

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:07.267
and saving my life.

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:14.004
A samurai does not take credit
for victories of others.

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:22.486
This belonged to Basho.

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:28.457
A samurai wears two swords.

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:40.437
<i>When a crime goes unpunished,</i>

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:43.503
the world is unbalanced.

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:46.305
When a wrong is unavenged,

01:21:46.535 --> 01:21:49.275
the heavens look
down on us in shame.

01:21:50.839 --> 01:21:55.046
<i>We too must die for this circle
of vengeance to be closed.</i>

01:22:02.117 --> 01:22:05.586
<i>We will leave this
record of our courage</i>

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:10.136
<i>so the world will know who
we were and what we did.</i>

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:23.910
<i>Tonight we will regain our honor</i>

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.581
<i>and avenge our lord.</i>

01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:35.194
<i>None of us knows
how long he shall five</i>

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:37.829
<i>or when his time will come.</i>

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:44.001
<i>But soon all that will be
left of our brief lives</i>

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:49.737
<i>is the pride our children feel
when they speak our names.</i>

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:01.410
Kai.

01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:35.117
We end this now.

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:49.063
Now

01:23:50.626 --> 01:23:52.899
we are 47.

01:24:03.005 --> 01:24:04.106
What do you see?

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:08.813
The omens are good.

01:24:09.011 --> 01:24:11.751
Soon you will travel far.

01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:17.255
In every town and village,
people shall bow before you.

01:24:27.162 --> 01:24:28.332
Halt!

01:24:52.354 --> 01:24:53.455
Let them through.

01:26:12.801 --> 01:26:14.380
Five minutes!

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:42.233
Lord Kira, we are proud
to present to you

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:45.904
our performance as a
gift for your wedding.

01:30:16.011 --> 01:30:17.784
Don't hurt the princess!

01:30:31.693 --> 01:30:32.794
Kai!

01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:04.230
Get them!

01:31:51.039 --> 01:31:52.550
Stay there!

01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:15.734
I knew you'd come for me.

01:33:16.191 --> 01:33:18.635
Nothing will ever keep
me away from you.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.587
Nothing, half-breed?

01:33:43.218 --> 01:33:44.388
Even death?

01:33:45.053 --> 01:33:46.359
I know what you are.

01:33:46.955 --> 01:33:48.432
You have no idea.

01:33:49.491 --> 01:33:51.161
I'm not afraid of you.

01:33:52.127 --> 01:33:53.706
You should be.

01:35:27.689 --> 01:35:28.859
Come on.

01:36:15.069 --> 01:36:19.515
Know now the depth
of my lord's courage.

01:37:46.961 --> 01:37:49.940
In the name of Lord Asano of Ako!

01:38:09.984 --> 01:38:11.757
For Lord Asano!

01:40:05.633 --> 01:40:06.939
Chikara.

01:40:48.009 --> 01:40:50.111
Rest now, My Lord.

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:53.621
You are avenged.

01:41:01.556 --> 01:41:03.658
Oishi,

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:07.431
I gave you a command forbidding
you to take revenge.

01:41:08.496 --> 01:41:10.598
Forgive me, Your Highness,

01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:16.980
but a man may not live
under the same heaven

01:41:18.072 --> 01:41:20.516
as the murderer of his lord.

01:41:24.045 --> 01:41:27.957
All I ask is respect for my men.

01:41:29.517 --> 01:41:32.154
They are brave, My Lord.

01:41:34.121 --> 01:41:35.700
The bravest I know.

01:41:41.062 --> 01:41:43.472
I beg you to let them die

01:41:44.365 --> 01:41:46.206
with the dignity they deserve.

01:41:53.874 --> 01:41:56.147
For the crime of disobedience,

01:41:57.878 --> 01:42:01.653
you should all be executed
as common criminals.

01:42:04.051 --> 01:42:05.926
But you and your men

01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:09.000
followed the old ways of Bushido

01:42:10.558 --> 01:42:11.932
to honor your lord

01:42:12.393 --> 01:42:14.530
and to avenge treachery.

01:42:22.303 --> 01:42:25.009
I see only samurai before me.

01:42:26.741 --> 01:42:29.845
I grant you a samurai's death,

01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:33.247
to be buried alongside your lord

01:42:34.582 --> 01:42:36.184
with honor.

01:42:37.752 --> 01:42:41.925
Thank you, Your Highness.

01:43:01.776 --> 01:43:04.550
Lady Asano is like her father.

01:43:08.783 --> 01:43:12.797
She will make Ako great again.

01:43:15.556 --> 01:43:16.726
Yes.

01:43:18.492 --> 01:43:19.627
I know.

01:43:57.198 --> 01:43:59.141
My father told me

01:44:00.367 --> 01:44:04.040
this world was only a
preparation for the next,

01:44:06.173 --> 01:44:11.484
that all we can ask is that
we leave it having loved

01:44:11.545 --> 01:44:13.056
and being loved.

01:44:17.551 --> 01:44:21.497
I will search for you
through 1,000 worlds

01:44:22.523 --> 01:44:26.298
and 10,000 lifetimes
until I find you.

01:44:29.196 --> 01:44:32.004
I will wait for you in all of them.

01:45:24.084 --> 01:45:25.424
Wait!

01:45:28.589 --> 01:45:30.259
Chikara,

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:32.029
son of Oishi,

01:45:32.593 --> 01:45:34.536
step out.

01:45:53.681 --> 01:45:55.419
Oishi,

01:45:56.183 --> 01:46:00.629
I will not deny our
country your bloodline.

01:46:01.622 --> 01:46:03.633
Your son shall live

01:46:04.959 --> 01:46:06.470
to serve Ako

01:46:08.362 --> 01:46:11.068
as you and your samurai have done.

01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:34.190
<i>I will search for you
through 1,000 worlds</i>

01:47:34.248 --> 01:47:36.988
<i>and 10,000 lifetimes</i>

01:47:38.719 --> 01:47:40.594
<i>until I find you.</i>

01:48:11.085 --> 01:48:13.859
<i>The memory of the 47 Ronin</i>

01:48:13.921 --> 01:48:18.026
<i>who put duty and justice
before their fear of death</i>

01:48:18.092 --> 01:48:20.035
<i>has lived down through
the centuries</i>

01:48:20.094 --> 01:48:23.300
<i>as one of the greatest
examples of honor and loyalty</i>

01:48:23.364 --> 01:48:25.102
<i>in Japanese culture.</i>
