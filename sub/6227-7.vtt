00:00.918 --> 00:02.118
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.127 --> 00:03.344
The others were dead
when we got here.

00:03.420 --> 00:04.421
Who is this?

00:04.505 --> 00:05.631
Keep the phone.

00:05.714 --> 00:08.475
There was a phone ringing
by your bed. It was Chavez's phone.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.473
Adalind?
Meisner?

00:10.552 --> 00:13.055
The last thing Chavez said
before she died was,

00:13.138 --> 00:15.232
"They're coming to Portland.
It's war."

00:15.599 --> 00:17.693
Looks like
a gang-related rampage.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.111
Happened around midnight.

00:19.228 --> 00:21.348
It's all over the city,
three different neighborhoods.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.864
They made me do it.
They made me!

00:22.940 --> 00:24.066
Why are you doing this?

00:24.149 --> 00:26.430
I thought they were gonna kill me.
I didn't have a choice.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.195
I don't want to die!
Shut up!

00:28.445 --> 00:29.742
You know who this is?

00:29.821 --> 00:30.981
Monroe, it's a trap!

00:31.031 --> 00:32.283
Xavier set you up!

00:34.117 --> 00:35.289
Inside, come on!

00:49.925 --> 00:50.972
Juliette?

01:02.980 --> 01:04.072
Oh, my God!

01:04.147 --> 01:05.820
That looked like...
Can%be!

01:10.445 --> 01:12.914
That was her.
That was Juliette.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.833
How? You told us
she was dead.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.210
Her hair was different, the
way she moved was different,

01:17.286 --> 01:18.663
but it was her,
I know it was her.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.624
But she died in your arms, Nick.
You said.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.004
She did.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.922
She did.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.471
So whoever took her body
brought her back to life?

01:27.546 --> 01:29.298
I know it doesn't make any
sense, and I can't explain it,

01:29.381 --> 01:31.179
but I know what I saw!

01:31.258 --> 01:32.851
And she looked right at me.
She saw me, too!

01:32.926 --> 01:33.973
It looked just like her.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.931
Well, whoever it was,
she just saved our lives.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.937
Where you going?
To talk to Trubel.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.690
She was there that night. She
has to know what's going on.

01:42.603 --> 01:43.980
Juliette's alive?

01:44.062 --> 01:45.279
We all saw the same thing.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.948
Okay, this is just
too weird.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.947
Fingerprint the bodies, and
let's get the hell out of here.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.284
We do not
want to be tied to this.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.361
It's Rosalee.

01:52.946 --> 01:53.947
Hey, Rosalee.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.409
Where's Monroe? Are you okay?
He's not answering his phone.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.289
I'm right here, honey. I'm sorry.
I dropped my phone.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.415
We're all okay.

01:59.494 --> 02:00.996
Oh, my God.
Thank God.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.752
Oh, my God.
I was worried sick.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.378
Are you all right?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.210
Yes, yes.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.491
I'm still with Xavier. What do
you want me to do with him?

02:09.545 --> 02:10.967
Where are you?
In my car.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.208
He's sitting
right next to me.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.134
Don't let him out of your sight.
We need to talk to him.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.390
Yeah, I definitely
need to talk to him.

02:16.553 --> 02:17.679
Where?

02:17.846 --> 02:18.846
Precinct?
No.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.436
It's not gonna be
that kind of questioning.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.937
Take him to the Spice Shop.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.392
We're on our way.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.436
And if
he tries anything...

02:24.519 --> 02:26.647
Don't worry, he won't.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.451
Don't you move.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.672
What's wrong?

02:51.755 --> 02:52.802
I just saw Juliette.

02:53.715 --> 02:54.841
What?

02:55.926 --> 02:57.348
She's alive,
and you know it!

02:57.427 --> 02:59.020
No, Nick, I...
Tell me the truth!

02:59.096 --> 03:01.144
I swear to God, I have no
idea what happened to her!

03:01.223 --> 03:02.395
But you knew she was alive.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.726
No.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.110
I mean, not for sure.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.187
She's either dead,
or she isn't!

03:07.270 --> 03:09.614
All I know is that she was
alive when Chavez took her,

03:10.524 --> 03:11.901
but I didn't know if
she was gonna survive

03:11.983 --> 03:13.030
what they were
gonna do to her.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.657
And what was that?

03:15.445 --> 03:16.537
Break her.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.741
What are you talking about?
Juliette's alive?

03:19.825 --> 03:22.169
Yes, I just saw her.

03:22.244 --> 03:23.541
Oh, my God, no.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.874
Chavez knew that Juliette was a
Hexenbiest and wanted to use her.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.584
For what?
A weapon.

03:28.667 --> 03:29.668
That's why they took her.

03:29.835 --> 03:30.882
Where did they take her?

03:36.466 --> 03:37.968
Where are you taking her?

03:38.677 --> 03:40.020
Where are you taking her?

03:40.470 --> 03:41.722
Let me go!

03:41.805 --> 03:43.398
Where are you taking her?

03:44.975 --> 03:46.852
That was the last time
I saw her.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.819
They sent me on
assignment that night.

03:52.274 --> 03:56.370
It wasn't till I got to Bangkok
that I heard rumors about them

03:56.445 --> 03:58.618
trying to turn a
Hexenbiest into a warrior.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.533
But nobody told me
if it worked.

04:00.615 --> 04:01.832
It did.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.250
She just took out 20 Wesen
who tried to kill me.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.580
By herself?
Yes.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.165
Where is she now?

04:09.124 --> 04:10.967
I don't know.
Well, somebody does.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.054
Meisner might.

04:14.129 --> 04:16.382
If he knew where Trubel was, he
probably knows where Juliette is.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.557
She's right.

04:17.632 --> 04:18.757
How can I get to Meisner?

04:19.843 --> 04:21.060
Chavez's phone.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.602
I... I swear, I never...
Shut up!

04:28.685 --> 04:30.062
But you have to believe...

04:30.145 --> 04:31.237
Shut up!

04:31.313 --> 04:33.315
You fly-eating
son of a bitch!

04:33.482 --> 04:35.109
You set us up?

04:35.192 --> 04:36.660
We tried to help you!

04:36.735 --> 04:39.158
You're safe now.
That's all I care about.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.119
Tell us the truth, or we
leave you alone with Monroe.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.200
Who got to you?

04:43.492 --> 04:44.869
I'm not... I'm not...

04:45.160 --> 04:46.787
Who set us up?

04:46.870 --> 04:49.123
Dallas and Billie were the
only ones who talked to me.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.674
They wanted me to join them.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.255
Join them?
To do what?

04:54.336 --> 04:55.337
It's too late.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.927
They're crazy.
They can't be stopped.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.849
From what?
From taking over!

05:00.425 --> 05:01.972
All Wesen must join.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.555
Anybody who doesn't agree
with them will be killed.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.351
You don't understand.
This is happening now.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.107
It's a revolution!

05:12.938 --> 05:14.690
There's no stopping them.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.001
Nick.
I want to see Juliette.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.364
I don't think
that's a good idea.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.965
I don't give a damn.
Where is she?

05:37.045 --> 05:39.298
The woman you knew
doesn't exist anymore.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.932
I want to talk to her.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.304
It's not that easy.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.886
You should've told me
she was alive.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.264
Give me a little time.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.517
What'd he say?

05:51.518 --> 05:52.770
He said he needed time.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.854
That's it?

05:53.937 --> 05:56.235
And that Juliette
doesn't exist anymore.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.816
What's that
supposed to mean?

05:58.567 --> 06:00.444
Where'd they take you?
Some old warehouse.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.904
I don't know.
It was dark.

06:01.987 --> 06:02.988
And that story
about escaping,

06:03.071 --> 06:05.199
hitting a guy over the head with
a brick, you made all that up?

06:05.282 --> 06:06.875
It's what they
told me to say.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.577
Now, Why'd they
pick you, Xavier?

06:09.327 --> 06:11.327
Why didn't they kill you
like the other shop owner?

06:13.415 --> 06:15.463
You're not going anywhere
unless you tell us.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.722
Because I...
Because I know Monroe.

06:20.797 --> 06:21.889
What?

06:21.965 --> 06:24.844
They showed me
a picture of Monroe.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.018
Are you kidding me?

06:26.094 --> 06:27.391
They started
asking questions.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.517
What kind of questions?

06:28.597 --> 06:29.598
About the Grimm.

06:30.265 --> 06:31.505
Because you're friends
with him.

06:31.808 --> 06:32.809
Oh.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.270
This is about
getting to Nick?

06:34.561 --> 06:35.938
And the people
around him.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.944
So you being all afraid to pick
Billie out of the line-up,

06:38.023 --> 06:39.320
that was just for show?

06:39.399 --> 06:41.151
Just so you could lure
Nick into an ambush?

06:41.234 --> 06:42.952
Well, I didn't know
you were gonna go with him.

06:43.028 --> 06:45.952
I'm sorry, is that supposed
to make you feel better?

06:46.031 --> 06:48.031
They were gonna kill me.
What was I supposed to do?

06:48.033 --> 06:49.785
How about
telling us the truth?

06:50.327 --> 06:52.375
You have to help me.

06:52.454 --> 06:53.455
Oh, no.
Calm down.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.253
No, no, no.
They're gonna kill me.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.709
- You really don't have to...
- Breathe.

06:56.791 --> 06:57.791
Breathe!

06:57.834 --> 06:59.461
Oh, my goodness.

07:00.670 --> 07:01.670
Man!

07:01.713 --> 07:03.761
All right,
calm down.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.015
I am sorry.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.353
Lordy.

07:12.682 --> 07:13.683
Um...

07:14.684 --> 07:16.311
What are we gonna do with him?
He's seen these guys.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.737
We let him go,
they'll kill him.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.780
Maybe that's not
such a bad idea.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.826
I mean, he did lead us
into the Teutoburg Forest.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.823
Famous ambush of the Romans by
the Germanic war chief Arminius?

07:27.906 --> 07:29.704
Three Roman legions
were decimated

07:29.783 --> 07:31.126
by an alliance of
Germanic tribes?

07:31.201 --> 07:33.124
Come on, it's, like,
Rome's greatest defeat.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.420
You mean like the Alamo?

07:34.496 --> 07:36.840
Yes. You know,
close enough.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.793
Let's put him
in protection.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.753
I want to know everyone
he came into contact with.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.053
Where are you taking me?

07:43.129 --> 07:44.130
Someplace safe.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.144
I... I really
am sorry, Monroe.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.722
Save it.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.200
They have your picture now. They'll
be breaking down our door next.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.402
I know.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.325
Maybe we should talk
to the Wesen Council.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.573
That's exactly
what I'm thinking.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.972
They need to know
what's going on.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.280
Where do you want him, Captain?
Holding cell.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.501
We pressing charges?
'Cause I'm all for that.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.257
Putting him in a cell until we
can set up protective custody.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.337
Different way to go.

08:24.421 --> 08:27.550
Meanwhile, got something. IDs on
all the bodies at the factory.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.976
Some local, some out of town.
Most of them have records.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.224
But the woman who led
us there, Billie Trump,

08:32.303 --> 08:33.304
not among them.

08:33.388 --> 08:34.388
She got away?

08:34.431 --> 08:36.104
Neverfound her body.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.025
Let's hit her place.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.148
Yup.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.437
Trubel with you?

08:40.854 --> 08:42.822
Yeah.
Was it Juliette?

08:42.897 --> 08:44.490
It was,
but it's complicated.

08:44.566 --> 08:47.661
Coming back from the dead usually is.
You okay?

08:47.986 --> 08:50.364
Not exactly, but there's not
much I can do about it now.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.994
Look, Billie Trump
got away.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.233
We're headed to
her place now.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.910
I'll meet you there.
No, we got this.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.210
You got a lot going on.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.505
Juliette has got to
be connected to this.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.628
She either followed us, or she
knew we were being set up.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.801
Well, guess that means
I'll see you there.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.546
I need you to stay here
while I'm gone.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.363
We need
the bomb squad.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.194
We've got a cache
of explosives here.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.906
Unit 31
requesting bomb squad.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.787
Copy that.
Bomb squad has been notified.

10:19.828 --> 10:20.829
Clothes are still here.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.789
Let's put 24-hour
surveillance on this place.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.044
I doubt
she's coming back.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.546
Even if she doesn't,
somebody will.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.593
Got some photographs
over here.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.972
Wonder what
Mom and Dad would say

10:31.047 --> 10:32.970
if they knew what their
little girl was up to.

11:33.568 --> 11:34.740
Lucien.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.447
How did this happen?

11:38.114 --> 11:40.537
She wasn't like anything
I've ever seen before.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.460
She?

11:43.786 --> 11:45.754
A Hexenbiest.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.332
Killed them all.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.010
I'm sorry.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.008
I failed.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.965
It's just one battle.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.476
And our army is growing.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.149
We will honor our dead,

12:07.977 --> 12:10.480
and find the bitch
who did this.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.745
Sit down.
You're making me nervous.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.247
Sorry.

12:31.501 --> 12:32.593
State your name.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.171
Hello,
this is Rosalee Calvert.

12:34.254 --> 12:38.225
Rosalee Calvert, your identity is
confirmed. What are you reporting?

12:38.299 --> 12:39.972
I need to speak
with the Wesen Council.

12:40.051 --> 12:43.146
Please call me back as soon as possible.
It's an emergency.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.519
The Council will
review your request.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.191
There's something
I didn't tell you.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.110
What?

12:57.193 --> 12:58.313
When we were
ambushed tonight

12:58.361 --> 13:00.363
by, like, 20 people
who were trying to kill us,

13:00.446 --> 13:03.495
the only reason we got out alive
is because somebody saved us.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.542
Trubel?
No.

13:06.703 --> 13:07.704
Um...

13:08.871 --> 13:09.918
Juliette.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.792
What are you talking about?

13:11.874 --> 13:13.296
Juliette is
the one who saved us.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.337
Like, she's alive.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.421
Monroe?

13:16.504 --> 13:18.472
I mean, her hair is
really blonde, but...

13:18.548 --> 13:20.721
Nick said
Trubel killed her.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.801
We all saw her.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.477
That's impossible!

13:23.553 --> 13:25.180
No, I know.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.015
It's impossible.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.566
Except we all saw her.

13:29.058 --> 13:32.107
I mean, just for, like,
a split second, but...

13:33.813 --> 13:34.814
Juliette's alive?

13:34.897 --> 13:35.898
I think she is.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.702
Oh, my God! How?

13:39.777 --> 13:40.903
We don't know yet.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.227
Nick is trying to
figure it out.

13:42.405 --> 13:43.827
Is this another
back-from-the-dead thing?

13:43.906 --> 13:44.998
'Cause I'm really not ready

13:45.074 --> 13:46.701
to host another
Jack the Ripper party.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.752
Let's just hope
it's not something worse.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.566
Urgent call from
Rosalee Calvert.

14:10.641 --> 14:11.733
Now what?

14:11.809 --> 14:14.187
She didn't say. She wants
us to call her back.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.158
See what it's about, huh?

14:24.030 --> 14:29.002
But when we left the room, they were
everywhere, but they were all dead.

14:29.077 --> 14:32.877
So this blonde Juliette
killed them all by herself?

14:33.247 --> 14:35.045
I mean, she was
the only one out there

14:35.124 --> 14:36.216
when we got out, so...

14:39.295 --> 14:40.922
I think that's the Council.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.684
This is Rosalee Calvert.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.138
It's Alexander.
What are you reporting?

14:49.764 --> 14:53.189
A number of Wesen shop owners were
attacked by Wesen last night.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.689
In Portland?
Yes.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.646
And a lot of their shops
were destroyed.

14:56.729 --> 14:57.901
Was anyone killed?

14:57.980 --> 14:58.980
One.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.991
And the same people tried
to kill Nick and Monroe.

15:01.901 --> 15:02.902
Tell him about the mark.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.659
Oh, and they're leaving
behind a mark, four lines.

15:05.780 --> 15:06.872
Schwarzkralle.

15:06.948 --> 15:07.995
You've heard of it?

15:08.366 --> 15:10.994
The English translation
is "Black Claw."

15:12.453 --> 15:14.080
We've been told
they kill Wesen

15:14.163 --> 15:15.710
who refuse to
join their cause.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.212
We are aware of the problem.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.506
This has been happening
in other places?

15:19.585 --> 15:22.759
It's being addressed. I can't
go into detail right now.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.841
Well, the Council needs
to do something about this.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.392
We are.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.060
I'll get back to you.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.315
Black Claw?

15:45.403 --> 15:46.780
Everything all right?

15:46.863 --> 15:47.864
Yeah.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.750
Kelly's asleep. I think
Adalind may still be up.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.336
Thanks for staying up.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.170
If you want me to leave, I can
find someplace else to stay.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.719
You're not going anywhere.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.103
Look, I don't blame you for
what happened to Juliette.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.397
If you weren't at my house
that night, I'd be dead.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.608
Nick, I should've
said something.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.496
I just can't believe
this is happening.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.487
She was dead.
I saw her die.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.240
And now what?

16:23.316 --> 16:25.284
What, she saved my life?

16:26.444 --> 16:28.538
This has got to be
really weird for you.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.999
I want some answers.

16:35.786 --> 16:36.787
Monroe.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.165
Rosalee just called
the Wesen Council.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.125
The group is
called Black Claw.

16:41.209 --> 16:42.756
And the Council
knows about them.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.803
- Well, what are they gonna do about it?
- We don't know.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.005
Alexander is gonna
get back to us.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.807
And, Nick, Monroe told me
about Juliette.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.180
You really think it was her?

16:50.343 --> 16:51.344
I know it was her.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.397
Oh, my God,
this is insane.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.395
Let me know when you hear
back from the Council.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.687
You ever hear
of Black Claw?

17:01.771 --> 17:05.070
Oh, hell yeah. My last two
jobs had to do with them.

17:05.148 --> 17:06.195
Here?

17:06.275 --> 17:08.198
No, Lisbon and Bangkok.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.869
But they're here now.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.955
I mean, from what I know,
they're everywhere.

17:13.406 --> 17:14.875
What else do you
know about them?

17:14.951 --> 17:18.501
They're Wesen, all kinds.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.461
Not afraid of dying for
whatever it is they believe in.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.259
That's why Chavez
wanted you?

17:24.126 --> 17:25.502
I think so.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.971
All right, get some sleep.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.531
You're still awake?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.960
It's kind of hard to
sleep after finding out

17:55.992 --> 17:57.790
that the woman who
tried to kill me and you

17:57.868 --> 18:00.997
and helped the Royals steal my
daughter is alive and well.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.843
I'm not gonna
let her hurt you.

18:06.377 --> 18:08.971
You heard Trubel.
She's a weapon.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.265
And what if she
goes after Kelly?

18:11.966 --> 18:14.389
What if she's like the old
Juliette and wants you back?

18:14.468 --> 18:16.508
I know you feel responsible
for what happened to her

18:16.512 --> 18:17.980
and that makes you vulnerable.
Adalind...

18:18.055 --> 18:21.025
It makes me and our son
vulnerable as well.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.777
Juliette being back
does not change

18:23.853 --> 18:25.947
the way I feel
about Kelly or you.

18:26.897 --> 18:27.898
You sure?

18:27.982 --> 18:29.029
I'm sure.

18:37.992 --> 18:41.622
Mounting reports from Juarez,
Damascus, Istanbul,

18:41.704 --> 18:47.086
and several cities in sub-Saharan
Africa are equally as troubling.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.137
According to our agents,

18:50.212 --> 18:52.681
this political unrest
in Asia and Europe

18:52.757 --> 18:55.135
is being instigated
by Schwarzkralle.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.646
They are organizing
far beyond our...

18:59.722 --> 19:02.191
What we thought
them capable of.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.815
This threatens all of us,

19:04.894 --> 19:07.272
and it cannot be tolerated.

19:07.355 --> 19:12.202
We need to take the vote
on implementing our response.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.153
Make no mistake.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.830
We are at war.

19:16.906 --> 19:21.503
And we can have no mercy
on those responsible.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.580
All in favor.

19:26.374 --> 19:27.421
No.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.838
Occultatum Libera!

19:56.320 --> 19:57.492
Nick.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.831
What's going on?

20:02.910 --> 20:04.127
I don't know.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.468
Trubel just left.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.832
You shouldn't have come.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.708
Why didn't you
tell me she was alive?

20:46.787 --> 20:48.027
You can't be here.
Where is she?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.833
I'll contact Burkhardt when
the time is right.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.008
That's not good enough.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.556
You're still hurt.
Don't make it worse.

21:04.764 --> 21:05.890
What did you do to her?

21:06.974 --> 21:08.396
What we had to!

21:24.366 --> 21:25.367
Nothing from Trubel?

21:25.868 --> 21:27.120
Not yet.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.622
I can't believe she
would just leave like that.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.127
She wouldn't.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.633
I know what I'm doing
is important,

21:36.712 --> 21:39.056
and Kelly needs me
more than anyone else,

21:39.131 --> 21:42.385
but I wish there was something
I could do to help you.

21:43.552 --> 21:48.103
And I wish that having this
baby had been our choice.

21:48.182 --> 21:49.980
I can't help but wonder

21:50.059 --> 21:53.359
if you think this should have
been Juliette's child, not mine.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.749
I had a chance for
a normal life with Juliette,

22:07.827 --> 22:10.751
and you gave that to me when you
stopped me from being a Grimm.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.174
That wasn't exactly
my intention at the time.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.593
Well, I know.

22:16.502 --> 22:17.924
But Still,

22:18.712 --> 22:20.430
we had a chance,
and we didn't take it.

22:21.882 --> 22:24.010
I wish I could
take it all back,

22:24.093 --> 22:25.436
everything I did to you.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.440
Except for Kelly.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.234
Except for Kelly.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.047
That was so not
a good thing to do.

22:54.123 --> 22:57.593
I wouldn't say that. It's just a
little complicated right now.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.545
Yeah. I've thought
about it a lot.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.388
Me, too.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.181
Thinking about
it's a lot safer.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.010
I don't think there's
anything safe about us.

23:06.260 --> 23:10.640
But, if anything ever does,
you know, get going,

23:11.640 --> 23:14.314
we should make sure
it is about us.

23:24.278 --> 23:25.951
Who is it?
It's Trubel.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.458
Where have you been?

23:31.785 --> 23:32.911
I saw Meisner.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.538
What did he say?

23:35.497 --> 23:37.090
You're gonna see
Juliette today.

23:39.501 --> 23:42.129
He'll contact you later.
It'll be a public place.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.680
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

23:44.757 --> 23:46.179
I have to deal with this.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.469
Yeah, you do.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.432
Hank.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.607
We found
Billie Trump's parents.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.105
They live in West Linn.

23:56.185 --> 23:57.437
We should
pay them a visit.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.237
That's what I was thinking.

23:59.313 --> 24:00.530
Any word on Juliette?

24:00.648 --> 24:02.446
I'm supposed to
meet her today.

24:02.524 --> 24:03.901
You talk to her?

24:03.984 --> 24:05.201
Not yet.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.534
I'll talk to you
when I get in.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.532
Yeah, I'm staying here.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.618
I'm tired, and I'm hungry.

24:24.380 --> 24:28.556
We lost a lot of
good soldiers, and it hurts.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.641
It hurts to the core.

24:32.388 --> 24:35.562
This pain is so dark,
it will never go away.

24:36.100 --> 24:39.604
They were our friends,
our families,

24:40.688 --> 24:42.110
people we loved.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.405
They were willing
to give their lives

24:45.484 --> 24:46.906
for something
that they believed

24:46.986 --> 24:48.613
would change
centuries of repression

24:49.196 --> 24:52.416
and fear and humiliation.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.248
And they will
not be forgotten.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.417
Spread the word.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.708
The days of hiding
in shadows are over,

25:01.500 --> 25:05.550
but the nights of vengeance
have just begun.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.590
What about Xavier?

25:08.298 --> 25:10.096
They're all dead
because of him.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.559
The cops still have him.

25:15.389 --> 25:16.982
He'll pay for what he did.

25:20.811 --> 25:21.937
Jed.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.969
Looks like Billie
had it pretty good.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.800
Gavin Trump?
Yes?

25:50.924 --> 25:54.019
I'm Detective Burkhardt.
This is Detective Griffin.

25:54.094 --> 25:56.062
We'd like to talk to you
about your daughter, Billie.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.139
What's going on?

25:57.222 --> 25:59.691
They're police detectives
asking about Billie.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.610
Oh, my God, what happened?
Is she all right?

26:01.685 --> 26:03.528
Billie was involved
in a violent confrontation.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.402
There's a warrant
out for her arrest.

26:05.481 --> 26:06.482
What?

26:06.565 --> 26:08.158
Is she here?
No.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.031
When was the last time
you were in touch with her?

26:10.110 --> 26:13.740
Last time was about two,
maybe three weeks ago.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.039
Do you know
if she was involved

26:15.115 --> 26:16.458
in any groups or gangs?

26:16.533 --> 26:18.285
Gangs? No, not Billie.

26:18.368 --> 26:19.620
Do you know
a Dallas Cruz?

26:19.703 --> 26:20.704
No.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.123
Why are you asking
all these questions?

26:23.207 --> 26:24.675
What's she done?

26:25.167 --> 26:26.669
Have you ever seen this?

26:34.009 --> 26:36.129
If you know about the Black
Claw, you need to tell us.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.476
We have nothing
more to say to you.

26:39.807 --> 26:41.309
Your daughter is
in real danger.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.894
Billie is living her life
with courage and conviction.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.025
And we have never
been more proud.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.698
Now, get off our property.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.991
We're done
talking, Grimm.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.370
So much for
upstanding citizens.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.328
I didn't do anything.
I didn't hit him!

27:00.410 --> 27:01.890
No, he tripped
onto your fist.

27:01.912 --> 27:04.006
Then why are you
putting me in jail?

27:04.081 --> 27:05.674
Bed and breakfasts
were all booked up.

27:05.749 --> 27:07.296
Hey, wait, wait, wait,
I remember now.

27:07.376 --> 27:08.798
I wasn't even there!

27:08.877 --> 27:10.220
That's why
you're not here.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.592
No, I wasn't there!

27:11.672 --> 27:12.969
Hey, man, you're not
hearing me.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.425
I wasn't
even there, man!

27:31.358 --> 27:32.985
Who's that?

27:33.068 --> 27:34.411
Could be Alexander.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.863
About time.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.452
This is Rosalee Calvert.

27:37.531 --> 27:38.651
They're all dead.

27:39.241 --> 27:41.289
What? The Council,
every one of them.

27:41.368 --> 27:43.245
What?
I barely made it out myself.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.705
Oh, my God!

27:45.080 --> 27:46.457
Oh, my God, who did this?

27:46.540 --> 27:48.008
One of the Council members.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.711
I had no idea
he was Schwarzkralle.

27:50.794 --> 27:54.594
It all happened so fast. I probably
shouldn't have called you, but...

27:56.008 --> 27:57.134
No help will be coming.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.772
What are you gonna do?
Run.

28:03.432 --> 28:04.558
What happened?

28:04.641 --> 28:06.063
He hung up.

28:06.143 --> 28:09.522
So, the Wesen Council's,
what, wiped out?

28:09.605 --> 28:10.902
Just gone?

28:14.651 --> 28:16.244
Lousy son of a bitch.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.697
He had it coming.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.622
That guy I hit,
he deserved it.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.708
The cops, they don't care
if you got a reason or not.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.956
They don't care if it's justified.
I know I was right.

28:24.745 --> 28:25.792
He ruined me.

28:26.288 --> 28:28.040
And I lost everything
'cause of that guy,

28:28.123 --> 28:30.751
everything that I
worked for my whole life.

28:30.834 --> 28:31.881
So I hit him.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.972
Yeah, and I'm the one
that they put in jail.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.934
You don't even know
what I'm talking about, man.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.436
Well, I'm sick of it.

28:42.930 --> 28:44.307
I've had enough.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.457
Wait.
What are you doing?

28:47.017 --> 28:49.019
Hey, what are you doing?
No, no, no.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.319
No. Guard!

28:50.395 --> 28:52.113
Guard! Guard!

28:53.273 --> 28:54.553
You should've
listened to Billie.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.618
She told you
what would happen.

28:57.527 --> 28:59.154
Guard!

28:59.238 --> 29:01.866
Guard! Guard! Guard!

29:02.199 --> 29:03.701
Soon as we showed
them the mark,

29:03.784 --> 29:05.457
Billie's parents
backed off.

29:05.535 --> 29:07.412
Told us to get
off their property.

29:07.496 --> 29:10.215
They said Billie was living a
life of courage and conviction.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.130
- You do a background on the parents?
- We did.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.428
No priors. A couple
of driving violations.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.463
So we have a normal
middle-class mother and father

29:16.505 --> 29:17.757
who are backing
their daughter's involvement

29:17.839 --> 29:19.967
in a radical,
violent Wesen organization.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.552
Actually, they said
they were proud of her.

29:21.635 --> 29:23.195
Well, at least
they're being supportive.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.389
We got an attack
in the jail.

29:28.976 --> 29:30.774
Do you see it?

29:30.852 --> 29:32.274
Oh, my God! Do you see it?

29:32.354 --> 29:34.322
Put it down!
Officer, put the gun down!

29:34.398 --> 29:36.275
What the hell is it?
Put the gun down!

29:39.903 --> 29:41.246
Can't you see it?

29:42.614 --> 29:44.207
Tell me...

29:45.409 --> 29:47.252
it can't be real.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.547
Oh, my God.

29:56.336 --> 29:57.508
You saw it, right?

29:59.423 --> 30:01.141
It wasn't human.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.355
Oh, my God.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.978
This was not a random act.
This was a hit.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.155
They knew Xavier
was in custody.

30:15.230 --> 30:17.858
How? They must have
somebody on the inside.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.533
All right, from now on, we have
to assume we've been compromised.

30:22.612 --> 30:23.784
Anything to do with Black
Claw,

30:23.864 --> 30:25.332
we deal with
outside this precinct.

30:25.407 --> 30:26.829
It's Monroe.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.367
Yeah?

30:28.410 --> 30:31.584
You need to get down to the Spice
Shop, like, as soon as you can.

30:31.663 --> 30:32.880
What's the problem?

30:32.956 --> 30:35.835
It's Black Claw, but we can't
talk about this on the phone.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.214
Okay.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.805
And out.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.511
And in!

30:45.594 --> 30:46.766
Push!

30:57.606 --> 31:00.610
If it hadn't been for you, I'd
have been dead a long time ago.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.241
Yeah?

31:07.324 --> 31:09.247
We found out
where he's gonna be.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.301
We have one hour.

31:20.462 --> 31:21.930
They're here.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.636
Rosalee just heard back from Alexander.
It's bad.

31:27.511 --> 31:30.310
The Wesen Council
doesn't exist anymore.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.979
What? They were all killed
last night by Black Claw.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.401
All except for Alexander.

31:34.476 --> 31:36.820
That's how we found out.
Somehow he got out.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.272
The Council knew
about Black Claw?

31:38.355 --> 31:40.073
Yeah, except they
call it Schwarzkralle.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.149
Means the same thing.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.353
Well, where's Alexander now?

31:42.401 --> 31:43.402
On the run.

31:43.485 --> 31:44.525
When word gets out

31:44.569 --> 31:45.570
the Wesen Council's
been wiped out,

31:45.654 --> 31:47.134
I don't even know
what's gonna happen.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.954
I think Xavier knows a lot
more than he's telling us.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.579
- Xavier's dead.
- What?

31:53.662 --> 31:55.915
We put him in a cell before we could
get him into protective custody.

31:55.997 --> 31:56.998
Somebody got to him.

31:57.165 --> 32:00.089
He was killed by a Coyotl who
Woged in front of the jailer.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.420
Like, intentionally Woged?

32:01.503 --> 32:03.597
Like he didn't care
if anybody saw him or not?

32:03.672 --> 32:05.515
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.264
These nuts are
Woging in public?

32:08.343 --> 32:10.983
That means we've crossed a very
dangerous line.

32:18.228 --> 32:19.855
I need to go.
Now?

32:20.188 --> 32:22.156
I just got a text.
I'm meeting Juliette.

32:22.524 --> 32:23.525
What?
When?

32:23.608 --> 32:24.951
Right now.
We got to back you up.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.824
No, no, no, I have to go alone.
They'll know if I don't.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.246
Hold on. You trust this?

32:28.613 --> 32:29.705
Nick, what if
it's a setup?

32:29.781 --> 32:30.782
Then I'll handle it.

32:30.866 --> 32:31.867
Nick, wait a minute.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.793
You don't know what
you're dealing with here.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.839
This woman is not exactly in the
most stable place right now.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.299
She just killed
a whole bunch of people,

32:39.374 --> 32:41.672
albeit to save our lives, but...

32:41.751 --> 32:43.674
You know what?
Maybe there is no albeit.

32:43.753 --> 32:44.754
Maybe saving our lives

32:44.838 --> 32:46.431
had nothing to do
with it, you know?

32:46.506 --> 32:47.883
Who knows
why she killed them?

32:48.049 --> 32:49.346
Well, that's what
I need to figure out.

32:49.426 --> 32:50.518
Nick, why?

32:50.760 --> 32:53.388
Because I need to bury her,
one way or another.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.816
So not cool.
No.

33:00.562 --> 33:02.439
This just
doesn't feel right.

35:03.977 --> 35:05.695
I thought you were dead.

35:23.997 --> 35:24.998
Juliette.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.675
My name isn't Juliette.

35:28.877 --> 35:30.254
What am I supposed
to call you?

35:31.671 --> 35:33.218
They call me Eve.

35:35.425 --> 35:36.472
Why "Eve"?

35:37.969 --> 35:39.266
Because I'm starting over.

35:42.349 --> 35:43.817
Do you really think
it's that easy?

35:45.560 --> 35:46.937
It wasn't easy.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.278
You want to know
what isn't easy?

35:53.276 --> 35:55.449
Knowing that you set me up.

35:59.032 --> 36:00.875
And that you set up
my mother.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.919
What, are you gonna pretend
like you don't remember?

36:08.750 --> 36:10.593
I remember everything.

36:15.507 --> 36:16.929
I would have killed you.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.601
Well, the night is young.

36:30.355 --> 36:31.572
What did they do to you?

36:33.066 --> 36:34.443
What they had to.

36:35.235 --> 36:36.828
This was Chavez?

36:44.786 --> 36:47.665
You're dead, but you don't
have to stay that way.

36:52.252 --> 36:54.630
It's going to be difficult
to speak for a while.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.851
You will learn how
to focus that rage.

37:08.810 --> 37:10.357
If you survive.

37:15.817 --> 37:17.034
They saved me.

37:17.110 --> 37:18.407
Did they?

37:19.154 --> 37:20.326
And I saved you.

37:20.405 --> 37:21.497
Why?

37:24.909 --> 37:26.331
Tell me why.

37:29.664 --> 37:30.790
Look at me!

37:37.881 --> 37:39.599
Why did you even
agree to meet me here?

37:40.508 --> 37:42.431
Because they need you.

37:44.387 --> 37:45.513
For what?

39:12.976 --> 39:14.023
Let
me see your hands!

39:14.102 --> 39:15.103
Hey, police.

39:15.937 --> 39:17.530
I'm on the job.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.445
There was a man attacked
inside the restaurant.

39:19.482 --> 39:21.405
How many we looking for? Two.

39:21.484 --> 39:24.004
One of them's right there. There's
another one inside also dead.

39:24.237 --> 39:26.706
Both weapons are
inside on the floor.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.283
Threat's over,
but secure the area.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.446
There are some people inside.
I want to get them out.

39:30.493 --> 39:31.915
You off duty?

39:32.370 --> 39:34.543
No, I was meeting
one of my Cls.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.501
That's a victim there.
First suspect's right here.

39:37.959 --> 39:39.381
You do that?

39:40.169 --> 39:42.592
I didn't want to risk
shooting in a restaurant.

39:42.672 --> 39:43.673
Wow.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.227
Yeah, Burkhardt.

39:48.303 --> 39:49.304
It went well.

39:50.972 --> 39:52.019
Meisner.

39:52.432 --> 39:55.936
The man is Samuel Rankin, one of
the organizers for Black Claw.

39:56.019 --> 39:58.317
This was the one
opportunity we had.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.956
The others are his bodyguards. You
probably figured that one out.

40:00.982 --> 40:02.702
A lot of innocent people
could've been hurt.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.489
That's why we wanted you
to be there.

40:04.861 --> 40:06.534
What the hell is this,
some kind of test?

40:06.613 --> 40:08.991
It was. I'll be in touch.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.326
Sorry about the mess.

40:21.586 --> 40:22.758
Did you see Juliette?

40:23.338 --> 40:24.840
No.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.513
What? She was
supposed to meet you.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.681
I met Eve.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.605
Who's Eve?

40:36.559 --> 40:38.106
I have no idea.

40:42.190 --> 40:43.658
It went well.

40:45.735 --> 40:47.157
What's next?

40:47.862 --> 40:50.456
Get some rest.
You're going to need it.
