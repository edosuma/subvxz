01:15.868 --> 01:17.411
Hello.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.329
Hey, Stevie.

01:19.371 --> 01:21.040
The usual. We're on punishment.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.001
No good reason.

01:24.043 --> 01:25.168
We had the eggs,

01:24.043 --> 01:25.168
we had the golf clubs.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.128
What'd she expect?

01:27.170 --> 01:29.214
Whoa! Really?

01:30.549 --> 01:32.051
I want that thing

01:30.549 --> 01:32.051
spotless.

01:32.091 --> 01:34.135
I want to be able

01:32.091 --> 01:34.135
to lick the bricks.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.763
When are you going

01:34.177 --> 01:35.763
to lick the bricks?

01:35.804 --> 01:38.139
I want you to be able

01:35.804 --> 01:38.139
to lick the bricks.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.391
I'll lick the bricks right now.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.142
This is the last day

01:39.433 --> 01:41.142
of your punishment.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.144
Do you want me to

01:41.184 --> 01:43.144
tack on one day more?

01:43.186 --> 01:44.646
All right. All right.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.532
Hey, Stevie's dad got

01:53.405 --> 01:55.532
three extra tickets

01:55.574 --> 01:56.951
to the demolition derby.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.744
Cool.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.744
That's not even

01:56.992 --> 01:58.744
the best part.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.079
We're going with Stevie

02:00.120 --> 02:01.204
so we get the handicapped seats

02:00.120 --> 02:01.204
in the front.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.749
Hey, Mom,

02:03.791 --> 02:05.375
can we go to

02:03.791 --> 02:05.375
the demolition

02:03.791 --> 02:05.375
derby tomorrow?

02:05.417 --> 02:07.168
Demolition derby?

02:07.210 --> 02:08.963
What? You want to go tomorrow?

02:09.004 --> 02:10.047
Yeah. Why not?

02:10.089 --> 02:11.632
Our punishment's

02:10.089 --> 02:11.632
over tonight.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.175
You think we might have

02:11.673 --> 02:14.175
something planned for tomorrow?

02:14.217 --> 02:16.177
Yeah, the demolition derby.

02:16.219 --> 02:20.181
Or could it be that tomorrow is

02:16.219 --> 02:20.181
your father's  birthday?!

02:20.223 --> 02:20.975
Oh...

02:21.016 --> 02:22.225
We talked about this!

02:22.267 --> 02:23.602
Well, maybe Dad

02:22.267 --> 02:23.602
can come with us.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.353
Yeah, we can get him

02:23.644 --> 02:25.353
a ticket from a scalper.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.480
That could be our present.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.189
You're not going anywhere!

02:28.231 --> 02:29.232
You're staying at home

02:29.274 --> 02:31.192
and we're going to throw

02:29.274 --> 02:31.192
your father a birthday party

02:31.234 --> 02:33.194
like we talked about.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.030
I have something

02:33.236 --> 02:35.030
very special planned.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.115
Like what?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.365
It's none of your business.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.200
It's a surprise for your father.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.619
Honestly, I can't believe

02:39.242 --> 02:40.619
you boys!

02:40.661 --> 02:41.996
You have to be forced

02:42.037 --> 02:43.288
into celebrating

02:42.037 --> 02:43.288
your father's birthday?!

02:43.330 --> 02:45.874
You should be ashamed

02:43.330 --> 02:45.874
of yourselves!

02:45.916 --> 02:47.793
You know what?

02:45.916 --> 02:47.793
You don't have to yell at us.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.337
We can hear you just

02:47.835 --> 02:50.337
fine if you talk in a

02:47.835 --> 02:50.337
normal tone of voice.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.133
I'm okay

02:51.672 --> 02:54.133
with the present system.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.217
Get back to work.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.850
I'm not okay with

03:00.848 --> 03:02.850
the present system.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.226
How does she make me

03:02.891 --> 03:05.226
say things like that?

03:05.268 --> 03:07.395
Oh, my God.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.395
What is it?

03:07.437 --> 03:08.897
Francis is coming home.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.231
Really?

03:08.939 --> 03:10.231
You're kidding.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.483
No. This is his itinerary.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.110
His flight gets in tomorrow.

03:13.152 --> 03:15.236
I hope this doesn't ruin

03:13.152 --> 03:15.236
Mom's special plan.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.656
This  is  Mom's special plan.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.240
Why didn't

03:17.698 --> 03:19.240
she tell us?

03:19.282 --> 03:21.451
Because it's a surprise

03:19.282 --> 03:21.451
for Dad.

03:21.493 --> 03:24.245
And if we blow her secret,

03:21.493 --> 03:24.245
Mom is going to kill us.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.247
So we just need

03:24.287 --> 03:26.247
to keep our mouths shut

03:26.289 --> 03:27.248
and finish our work.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.583
Right.

03:29.918 --> 03:32.253
Come on, Dewey.

03:29.918 --> 03:32.253
You call this clean?

The demolition derby

03:59.614 --> 04:02.993
comes to the fairgrounds!

04:03.035 --> 04:06.205
Tonight at 8:00

04:03.035 --> 04:06.205
see Dr. Bob Edwards

and his '76 Impala station wagon

04:06.246 --> 04:10.959
of death, destruction, mayhem.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.301
This is so unfair.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.179
Dad has tons of birthdays,

04:22.221 --> 04:24.932
but there's only one

04:22.221 --> 04:24.932
demolition derby.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.308
We never get to do

04:24.973 --> 04:27.308
anything good.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.395
Well, at least Francis

04:27.350 --> 04:30.395
will be here.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.815
...'76 Impala station wagon

04:30.437 --> 04:33.815
of death!

04:33.857 --> 04:35.150
Yeah.

04:36.359 --> 04:39.320
Not bad.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.322
Still have a little snap

04:39.362 --> 04:41.322
in my skin.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.158
For the love

04:41.364 --> 04:43.158
of God,

04:43.200 --> 04:45.119
what did you do to me?

04:45.160 --> 04:46.203
What do you mean?

04:46.245 --> 04:47.537
All those sit-ups I did,

04:47.579 --> 04:49.330
all those miles I ran

04:47.579 --> 04:49.330
every morning

04:49.372 --> 04:52.333
and this is how you repay me,

04:49.372 --> 04:52.333
by looking like hell?

04:52.375 --> 04:53.585
You think I look bad?

04:53.627 --> 04:56.379
Please. The crow's feet,

04:53.627 --> 04:56.379
the turkey neck?

04:56.421 --> 04:58.924
Okay. A few years have gone by.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.551
There's been

04:58.966 --> 05:01.551
a little wear and tear.

05:01.593 --> 05:02.594
Wear and tear?

05:02.636 --> 05:05.139
You look like a puppet

05:02.636 --> 05:05.139
of yourself

05:05.180 --> 05:07.057
made out of cottage cheese.

05:07.099 --> 05:10.351
What are you talking about?

05:07.099 --> 05:10.351
Check out the pant melons.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.937
They still do the trick.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.563
Well, sure, it's magnificent,

05:13.605 --> 05:15.523
but you're not going

05:13.605 --> 05:15.523
to be able

05:15.565 --> 05:17.234
to coast on that forever.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.361
I postdate checks

05:20.403 --> 05:22.030
to the power company

05:20.403 --> 05:22.030
all the time.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.365
Why is that suddenly

05:22.072 --> 05:24.365
such a big deal?

05:24.407 --> 05:26.367
Look, I'm a little short

05:24.407 --> 05:26.367
this month

05:26.409 --> 05:29.370
(whispering):

05:26.409 --> 05:29.370
because I spent a lot of money

05:26.409 --> 05:29.370
to surprise my husband

05:29.412 --> 05:31.581
for his birthday,

05:29.412 --> 05:31.581
but next month...

05:31.623 --> 05:36.962
No, it was

05:31.623 --> 05:36.962
a special circumstance.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.380
Look, can I speak

05:37.004 --> 05:39.380
with your supervisor?

05:39.422 --> 05:42.176
No, don't put me on hol...

05:42.217 --> 05:43.677
Damn!

05:43.718 --> 05:45.386
Whoops.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.386
Let me get those.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.973
Oh, there's one.

05:48.015 --> 05:48.974
Yes, I'm still holding.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.433
Do you have

05:49.016 --> 05:50.433
to stay on the phone?

05:50.475 --> 05:52.393
Hal, would you please

05:50.475 --> 05:52.393
just give me a minute?

05:52.435 --> 05:53.895
They're threatening

05:52.435 --> 05:53.895
to cut off the power.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.190
It's a 24-hour number.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.190
You can call 'em back.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.691
No, I can't!

05:56.231 --> 05:57.691
Yes, you can!

05:57.732 --> 05:58.984
You know,

05:57.732 --> 05:58.984
there was a time

05:59.026 --> 06:00.819
when I didn't have to ask

05:59.026 --> 06:00.819
for your attention.

06:00.861 --> 06:01.862
What? Yes, I'm still...

06:01.903 --> 06:03.655
I thought you were

06:01.903 --> 06:03.655
getting the supervisor.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.698
A man likes

06:03.697 --> 06:04.698
to be noticed

06:04.739 --> 06:06.116
when he walks

06:04.739 --> 06:06.116
in a room, Lois.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.701
Boys, would you leave

06:06.158 --> 06:07.701
the room a minute

06:07.742 --> 06:09.203
so your father

06:07.742 --> 06:09.203
and I can talk?

06:09.244 --> 06:10.662
No!

06:13.748 --> 06:15.709
Excuse me?

06:15.750 --> 06:17.002
I'm not leaving.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.214
You guys just chase us

06:17.044 --> 06:20.214
out whenever you want

06:20.255 --> 06:21.422
without even asking us!

06:21.464 --> 06:24.301
I'm getting

06:21.464 --> 06:24.301
tired of it!

06:24.343 --> 06:26.303
Watching TV is the only thing

06:24.343 --> 06:26.303
to do in this house

06:26.345 --> 06:27.595
that's actually fun

06:27.637 --> 06:29.723
so you're left

06:27.637 --> 06:29.723
with two choices:

06:29.764 --> 06:32.309
You can either fight

06:29.764 --> 06:32.309
somewhere else

06:32.351 --> 06:34.269
or get us a TV

06:32.351 --> 06:34.269
for our room!

06:36.395 --> 06:39.440
There's no reasoning

06:36.395 --> 06:39.440
with that woman.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.735
I thought you made

06:39.482 --> 06:41.735
some good points.

06:41.776 --> 06:44.154
It doesn't matter.

06:41.776 --> 06:44.154
She doesn't listen anyway.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.446
It's like talking

06:44.196 --> 06:45.446
to a wall.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.367
(laughs)

06:45.488 --> 06:48.367
Hey, that's what we're doing.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.827
Just relax.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.827
It's only for a couple of hours.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.872
When Francis gets home,

06:50.869 --> 06:53.872
they'll forget all about it.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.414
We can get through this.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.386
We've been waiting

07:05.508 --> 07:07.386
for 20 minutes, Lois.

07:07.426 --> 07:08.469
When can we eat?

07:08.511 --> 07:10.638
Hal, we have to wait

07:10.680 --> 07:12.724
for the ice cream

07:10.680 --> 07:12.724
to loosen up.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.142
You know you like it soft.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.643
No, I don't.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.643
Yes, you do.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.563
In fact, so do we.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.563
We all do.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.480
Since when?

07:19.522 --> 07:21.858
Since yesterday.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.068
What happened yesterday?

07:23.110 --> 07:25.779
Dad, just be patient.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.779
This isn't a witch hunt.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.364
Just calm down

07:27.406 --> 07:29.657
and whatever happens

07:27.406 --> 07:29.657
is going to happen.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.326
What are you talking about?

07:33.328 --> 07:35.580
What I'm trying to say

07:33.328 --> 07:35.580
is we're going

07:35.622 --> 07:38.458
to get through this together

07:35.622 --> 07:38.458
as a family...

07:40.043 --> 07:42.545
...and as individuals

07:42.587 --> 07:46.216
in this great country

07:42.587 --> 07:46.216
where we live.

07:47.926 --> 07:48.885
(doorbell rings)

07:48.927 --> 07:50.304
Thank God!

07:50.345 --> 07:53.390
Come on, Hal.

07:53.432 --> 07:54.808
What are you doing?

07:54.849 --> 07:56.893
Giving you your present.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.686
Ta-da!

07:58.728 --> 08:00.563
Happy birthday, Dad.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.563
Francis!

08:00.605 --> 08:03.024
Oh, my God,

08:00.605 --> 08:03.024
it's Francis!

08:03.066 --> 08:04.025
(laughs)

08:04.067 --> 08:06.111
Oh, look at you!

08:04.067 --> 08:06.111
Come here!

08:06.153 --> 08:07.528
I can't believe it!

08:07.570 --> 08:09.448
How long

08:07.570 --> 08:09.448
are you staying?

08:09.489 --> 08:10.949
A few days.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.949
Are you surprised?

08:10.991 --> 08:12.326
Surprised?

08:10.991 --> 08:12.326
I'm in shock!

08:12.367 --> 08:13.534
Well, you should be.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.536
I've been planning

08:13.576 --> 08:15.536
this for months.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.455
Thank you.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.538
Happy birthday, honey.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.539
Hold on.

08:18.581 --> 08:22.336
I've got another surprise

08:18.581 --> 08:22.336
for you.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.545
Everybody, this is Piama.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.507
She's my wife.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.014
We're married.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.556
Hi.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.558
I was going to tell you

08:35.598 --> 08:37.558
over the phone

08:37.600 --> 08:39.727
and then I thought

08:37.600 --> 08:39.727
why not bring her down here

08:39.769 --> 08:41.188
and surprise you

08:39.769 --> 08:41.188
in person?

08:41.229 --> 08:42.605
What do you mean

08:41.229 --> 08:42.605
you're married?

08:42.647 --> 08:44.565
Piama and I are

08:42.647 --> 08:44.565
husband and wife.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.817
We got married last week.

08:45.859 --> 08:46.860
Last week?

08:46.901 --> 08:48.569
Francis, who is this woman?

08:48.611 --> 08:51.823
She's my wife.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.823
Her name is Piama.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.034
Hello.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.579
Well, come on.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.581
Isn't anyone going

08:58.621 --> 09:00.581
to congratulate us?

09:00.623 --> 09:01.582
What?

09:01.624 --> 09:02.834
For getting married.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.585
That's what families do.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.628
I think I'm going

09:04.627 --> 09:05.628
to be sick.

09:05.670 --> 09:06.838
Well, come on, Mom.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.589
You can at least try

09:06.880 --> 09:08.589
and be and happy for me.

09:08.631 --> 09:09.883
I'm sorry, Francis.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.592
This is a hell of a thing

09:09.924 --> 09:11.592
to dump in my lap

09:11.634 --> 09:13.512
on your father's birthday.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.305
Yeah, it's all about you, Mom.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.598
Excuse me for thinking

09:15.347 --> 09:17.598
that my family

09:17.640 --> 09:19.600
would be excited

09:17.640 --> 09:19.600
to meet my wife.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.311
I can't believe you guys!

09:21.353 --> 09:23.604
Come on, Francis,

09:21.353 --> 09:23.604
it's not their fault.

09:23.646 --> 09:24.689
What did you expect?

09:24.731 --> 09:26.525
You could have at least

09:24.731 --> 09:26.525
called ahead of time.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.984
Boys, go to your room!

09:28.026 --> 09:30.195
What? What do you mean?

09:28.026 --> 09:30.195
We're on your side.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.654
I said go!

09:35.325 --> 09:36.535
How long have you

09:35.325 --> 09:36.535
known each other?

09:36.576 --> 09:37.618
You never mentioned her.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.621
I only met her

09:37.660 --> 09:40.621
a month ago... today.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.499
Happy anniversary.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.666
Plus we had

09:42.541 --> 09:43.666
the whole bus ride down.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.627
A month?

09:43.708 --> 09:46.627
I misjudged you.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.629
You know, come to think of it,

09:46.669 --> 09:48.629
that's the longest

09:48.671 --> 09:51.216
you ever stuck with anything

09:48.671 --> 09:51.216
in your life.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.633
Congratulations.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.885
You outlasted

09:52.675 --> 09:53.885
his paper route.

09:53.927 --> 09:57.013
Lady, you don't want

09:53.927 --> 09:57.013
to stick your hand

09:53.927 --> 09:57.013
in my face.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.639
Hey, everybody,

09:57.055 --> 09:58.639
let's just calm down.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.641
We are calm!

09:58.681 --> 10:00.641
It's Mom who's flipping out!

10:00.683 --> 10:03.311
Oh, Francis, I haven't

10:00.683 --> 10:03.311
even started to flip out!

10:03.353 --> 10:04.854
Why can't you just

10:03.353 --> 10:04.854
be happy for us?!

10:04.896 --> 10:06.731
LOIS:

10:04.896 --> 10:06.731
We're supposed to be happy

10:06.773 --> 10:08.358
when you repay us

10:06.773 --> 10:08.358
like this

10:08.400 --> 10:09.859
after all

10:08.400 --> 10:09.859
we've done for you?!

10:09.901 --> 10:11.486
FRANCIS: I'm confused!

10:09.901 --> 10:11.486
Are we talking about

10:11.528 --> 10:12.737
the years of

10:11.528 --> 10:12.737
psychological abuse

10:12.779 --> 10:15.865
or shipping me off

10:12.779 --> 10:15.865
to military school?!

10:15.907 --> 10:18.659
This family sucks.

10:15.907 --> 10:18.659
They don't care

10:15.907 --> 10:18.659
anything about us.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.370
They don't even listen to us.

10:20.412 --> 10:21.662
Let's get out of here.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.164
To the demolition derby?

10:23.206 --> 10:25.292
No. I mean,

10:23.206 --> 10:25.292
let's really get out of here

10:25.333 --> 10:26.834
and get away

10:25.333 --> 10:26.834
from these people.

10:26.876 --> 10:27.961
Where are we going to go?

10:28.002 --> 10:30.671
Wherever

10:28.002 --> 10:30.671
this takes us.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.673
I snagged it out of dad's wallet

10:30.713 --> 10:32.673
this morning.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.259
You knew we were going

10:32.715 --> 10:34.259
to need it tonight?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.386
Uh, yeah.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.054
I'm in.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.054
Yeah, but...

10:38.096 --> 10:39.931
FRANCIS:

10:38.096 --> 10:39.931
...and stomp it into a bloody

10:38.096 --> 10:39.931
pulp and throw it in the trash.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.267
LOIS:

10:39.973 --> 10:42.267
Why do I even try?

10:42.309 --> 10:43.684
You've been nothing

10:42.309 --> 10:43.684
but a problem

10:43.726 --> 10:45.562
since the day you were born.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.562
Let's go.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.730
PIAMA: He's trying to explain

10:45.604 --> 10:47.730
it to you

10:47.772 --> 10:49.524
if you'd just listen

10:47.772 --> 10:49.524
to him for once!

10:49.566 --> 10:53.069
Why are you talking?!

10:53.111 --> 10:54.695
Can we just stop this?!

10:54.737 --> 10:57.865
Let's get in the car

10:54.737 --> 10:57.865
and go for a drive to cool off.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.993
We can still have

10:57.907 --> 10:59.993
a nice birthday party.

11:00.034 --> 11:03.788
Oh, we are long past

11:00.034 --> 11:03.788
having a nice birthday party!

11:03.830 --> 11:05.999
As usual, Francis has

11:03.830 --> 11:05.999
taken something

11:06.040 --> 11:08.709
that should have been sweet

11:06.040 --> 11:08.709
and ruined it!

11:08.751 --> 11:10.044
Don't pin this on me!

11:10.086 --> 11:12.380
I am completely willing

11:10.086 --> 11:12.380
to have a party right now!

11:12.422 --> 11:15.716
Oh, you want to have a party?

11:12.422 --> 11:15.716
Happy damn birthday!

11:15.758 --> 11:18.345
Hey, why don't we all have

11:15.758 --> 11:18.345
some cake?!

11:21.764 --> 11:24.100
We don't want to be a part

11:21.764 --> 11:24.100
of this family anymore

11:24.142 --> 11:25.519
so we're leaving.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.728
Oh, great, Mom!

11:25.560 --> 11:27.728
Here we go with

11:25.560 --> 11:27.728
the dramatics!

11:27.770 --> 11:29.105
LOIS:

11:27.770 --> 11:29.105
Who else wants cake?!

11:29.147 --> 11:31.024
Thank you.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.024
You're welcome.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.318
Who wants some delicious

11:31.065 --> 11:33.318
damn cake?!

11:33.360 --> 11:34.735
Can Piama have a rose?

11:34.777 --> 11:37.238
Why not? There's plenty

11:34.777 --> 11:37.238
to go around!

11:37.280 --> 11:41.201
I'm the one who broke

11:37.280 --> 11:41.201
the ice-maker last year!

11:41.242 --> 11:43.244
Why do you have

11:41.242 --> 11:43.244
to ruin everything?!

11:43.286 --> 11:45.704
Well, I learned from

11:43.286 --> 11:45.704
the best, Mom!

11:52.504 --> 11:55.256
Wow, I've never been

11:52.504 --> 11:55.256
in a hotel this fancy before.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.757
This isn't a hotel, Dewey.

11:56.799 --> 11:57.967
It's our new home.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.718
Okay, let me do

11:58.009 --> 11:59.718
all the talking.

12:01.513 --> 12:02.763
May I help you?

12:02.805 --> 12:04.932
My dad called in

12:02.805 --> 12:04.932
a reservation.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.268
Okay...

12:07.310 --> 12:08.769
There you are.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.813
As soon as your

12:08.811 --> 12:10.813
dad signs this,

12:10.855 --> 12:11.772
you're all set.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.858
Oh, he's out

12:11.814 --> 12:13.858
at the car,

12:13.900 --> 12:15.610
but we can

12:13.900 --> 12:15.610
take care of it.

12:15.652 --> 12:16.777
Maybe you want to have a seat

12:16.819 --> 12:18.405
and we'll just wait

12:16.819 --> 12:18.405
for your dad.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.281
Is there any way

12:18.446 --> 12:20.281
we could speed this along?

12:20.323 --> 12:22.158
My little brother

12:20.323 --> 12:22.158
isn't feeling very well.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.035
Yeah, my dad's going

12:22.200 --> 12:24.035
to be a while out there.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.786
He's cleaning the car

12:24.077 --> 12:25.786
where Dewey got sick.

12:25.828 --> 12:29.165
I'm sorry, but

12:25.828 --> 12:29.165
an adult needs to

12:25.828 --> 12:29.165
sign for the room.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.791
Look, he's really sick.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.793
He could blow any second.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.795
He doesn't look that sick to me.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.676
(grunting)

12:41.928 --> 12:43.471
Dewey, that was amazing.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.056
They ran out of barf dust.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.516
I'm hungry.

12:46.558 --> 12:47.808
I bet you are.

12:47.850 --> 12:51.020
How do you guys

12:47.850 --> 12:51.020
want your steaks?

12:54.857 --> 12:56.817
Should we look in the park?

12:56.859 --> 12:59.487
No, nobody goes there anymore

12:56.859 --> 12:59.487
since they put the lights in.

13:00.655 --> 13:03.824
Oh.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.868
Why didn't you tell us

13:03.866 --> 13:05.868
you were getting married?

13:05.910 --> 13:06.869
I don't know, Dad.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.288
It just happened kind of fast.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.830
How can you know anyone

13:08.329 --> 13:09.830
in a month?

13:09.872 --> 13:11.832
Dad, I knew in a minute.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.294
Trust me, Piama is the one.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.878
She's a little fiery

13:15.920 --> 13:19.006
but she's also kind and funny

13:15.920 --> 13:19.006
and completely real.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.092
You just haven't gotten

13:19.048 --> 13:21.092
to know the real Piama.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.510
And whose fault is that?

13:22.552 --> 13:24.845
I know, I know, but that's

13:22.552 --> 13:24.845
why I brought her down with me

13:24.887 --> 13:26.347
so everyone would

13:24.887 --> 13:26.347
get to know her.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.309
It wasn't supposed to turn

13:26.389 --> 13:29.309
into the apocalypse.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.227
And what about you and Mom?

13:31.269 --> 13:32.853
You got married pretty quick.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.272
Yes, but I was

13:32.895 --> 13:34.272
a few years older.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.814
I had already been

13:34.314 --> 13:35.814
with a lot of...

13:37.275 --> 13:39.110
I had lived a full life.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.487
So you were older.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.863
I just happened to run into

13:40.528 --> 13:42.863
the exact right person for me

13:42.905 --> 13:44.073
a little earlier

13:42.905 --> 13:44.073
than you did.

13:44.115 --> 13:46.867
Once you meet

13:44.115 --> 13:46.867
that person, why wait?

13:46.909 --> 13:49.454
Huh? Why not do it if I'm sure?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.289
Should I not do it because

13:49.496 --> 13:51.289
my family's not sure?

13:51.331 --> 13:54.083
It wouldn't matter if

13:51.331 --> 13:54.083
the wedding was last week

13:54.125 --> 13:56.127
or next week or

13:54.125 --> 13:56.127
ten years from now,

13:56.169 --> 13:58.463
you and Mom still would have

13:56.169 --> 13:58.463
had a problem with it.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.880
All my life...

13:59.922 --> 14:01.716
I would have come, Francis.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.716
What?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.927
If you had invited me,

14:02.967 --> 14:04.927
I would have come.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.305
No, you...

14:09.349 --> 14:11.850
I'm sorry.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.901
Didn't I tell you

14:18.316 --> 14:20.901
flowers were a great idea?

14:20.943 --> 14:22.903
Okay, we're all set.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.906
You have the Plaza Burger,

14:22.945 --> 14:25.906
the Maine lobster,

14:25.948 --> 14:29.118
medium-rare Porterhouse,

14:25.948 --> 14:29.118
large platter of french fries

14:29.160 --> 14:31.579
and a complete dessert cart.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.376
Your parents certainly have

14:33.956 --> 14:36.376
interesting taste in food.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.502
Yeah, they do.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.086
Actually, I'm going to need

14:39.128 --> 14:41.339
one of your parents

14:39.128 --> 14:41.339
to sign that.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.508
I left the tip blank.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.926
Why don't you put in

14:43.550 --> 14:45.926
whatever you think is fair.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.638
Bon appétit.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.307
Dewey, your dinner's here!

14:51.349 --> 14:53.226
Here you go, Reese.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.102
Thank you, Malcolm.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.980
So this is what

14:55.144 --> 14:57.980
a $24 hamburger looks like.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.650
I thought it would be

14:58.022 --> 15:00.650
as big as my head.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.737
Ah. Why don't we have

15:00.692 --> 15:03.737
a Jacuzzi tub at home?

15:03.778 --> 15:05.572
Because that would

15:03.778 --> 15:05.572
make us happy.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.240
You know what,

15:05.613 --> 15:07.240
forget about that place.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.658
Tonight, this is our home.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.660
You got a lobster?

15:08.700 --> 15:10.660
Yes.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.036
I think I deserve

15:10.702 --> 15:12.036
a lobster.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.247
We all deserve

15:12.078 --> 15:14.247
something nice for once.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.875
Whoa, this dinner was expensive.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.168
I wonder what Dad's

15:16.916 --> 15:19.168
credit limit is.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.423
Let's find out.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.601
They should be home

15:32.014 --> 15:34.601
with the boys soon.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.021
How's your tea?

15:39.063 --> 15:40.981
Fine, thank you.

15:43.651 --> 15:44.778
Sugar?

15:44.819 --> 15:47.614
No, thanks.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.492
That's a pretty bracelet.

15:51.534 --> 15:52.993
Thank you.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.413
What kind of stone is that?

15:55.455 --> 15:56.581
Turquoise.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.998
Francis got it for me.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.959
Oh.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.006
How was your flight?

16:06.048 --> 16:07.258
We took the bus.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.176
That's right,

16:07.300 --> 16:09.176
I guess that's what Francis did

16:09.218 --> 16:11.262
with the money that I sent him

16:09.218 --> 16:11.262
for his plane fare.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.013
Plus the bracelet.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.683
Let's talk about something else.

16:15.725 --> 16:18.060
You know, Francis isn't

16:15.725 --> 16:18.060
the screw-up you think he is.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.395
Really?

16:19.437 --> 16:21.230
Did you know he works

16:19.437 --> 16:21.230
16 hours a day at his job

16:21.272 --> 16:22.398
and he still managed to build

16:22.440 --> 16:24.024
a wheelchair ramp

16:22.440 --> 16:24.024
for my uncle Jake.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.025
In fact...

16:24.066 --> 16:25.025
I don't think

16:25.067 --> 16:26.945
we should talk about Francis,

16:25.067 --> 16:26.945
either.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.028
Why not?

16:28.070 --> 16:29.530
He's my husband and your son.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.031
Needless to say, he and I have

16:31.073 --> 16:33.033
a very long and complicated

16:31.073 --> 16:33.033
history together

16:33.075 --> 16:35.035
that I don't feel like

16:33.075 --> 16:35.035
explaining to you.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.329
Admit it.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.247
You don't like me.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.540
I don't even know you.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.042
Well, what would you like

16:39.582 --> 16:42.042
to know?

16:42.084 --> 16:44.044
I'm 19.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.672
My mom ran off when I was three

16:45.713 --> 16:48.048
and my dad kicked me

16:45.713 --> 16:48.048
out of the house when I was 14

16:48.090 --> 16:49.550
because I threw out his liquor.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.051
I've been married

16:49.592 --> 16:51.051
once before,

16:51.093 --> 16:53.137
no kids, thank God,

16:53.179 --> 16:55.682
and last year,

16:53.179 --> 16:55.682
I spent three weeks in jail

16:55.723 --> 16:57.642
but it wasn't my fault.

16:57.684 --> 16:58.768
Will you stop this, please?

16:58.810 --> 17:00.060
You just can't stand

17:00.102 --> 17:03.105
for someone in your fancy family

17:00.102 --> 17:03.105
to marry beneath him.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.566
What?

17:05.608 --> 17:08.152
Just because

17:05.608 --> 17:08.152
I'm not all classy like you.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.696
Classy?

17:09.737 --> 17:11.489
You think I'm classy?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.073
Don't laugh at me.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.074
I'm sorry.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.284
It's just, this is a first.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.996
I hate to break it to you,

17:15.326 --> 17:17.996
but I am not classy.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.079
Oh, yeah.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.123
You know,

17:19.121 --> 17:21.123
I guess what you call class

17:21.165 --> 17:23.835
I call manners.

17:27.129 --> 17:31.091
I came down here

17:27.129 --> 17:31.091
hoping to get along with you,

17:31.133 --> 17:35.680
but you're not

17:31.133 --> 17:35.680
going to let that happen.

17:35.722 --> 17:41.101
You might be surprised

17:35.722 --> 17:41.101
at what I'd let happen.

17:41.143 --> 17:45.523
So, what's going to happen?

17:45.565 --> 17:48.192
I don't know.

17:48.234 --> 17:51.070
What is going to happen?

17:53.948 --> 17:55.115
Good news.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.535
The boys stole my credit card.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.954
All we have to do is call

17:57.577 --> 17:59.954
the credit card company and...

18:01.539 --> 18:03.123
You want to come

18:01.539 --> 18:03.123
outside, baby,

18:01.539 --> 18:03.123
Honey, why don't we go...

18:03.165 --> 18:05.084
and I'll show you

18:03.165 --> 18:05.084
my tree house?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.385
About time.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.137
We called for chocolate syrup,

18:14.427 --> 18:17.137
like, 30 minutes ago.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.514
(gasps)

18:18.556 --> 18:19.849
(grunts)

18:19.891 --> 18:21.141
(screams)

18:21.183 --> 18:22.142
Hello, Malcolm.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.604
(Malcolm groans)

18:22.184 --> 18:24.604
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.148
Beat it, Vicky.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.360
We'll finish

18:28.190 --> 18:31.360
the cuffs later.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.321
Okay, boys,

18:32.987 --> 18:34.321
get your things.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.990
We're going home.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.158
No, we're not

18:36.032 --> 18:38.158
going back there.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.160
Well, you can't stay

18:38.200 --> 18:40.160
in this hotel room forever.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.370
What are you going to do--

18:41.412 --> 18:43.957
live under a bridge and

18:41.412 --> 18:43.957
steal food out of Dumpsters?

18:43.998 --> 18:45.416
I don't know,

18:43.998 --> 18:45.416
but we're not going home.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.167
We've had it with

18:45.458 --> 18:47.167
the way you treat us

18:47.209 --> 18:48.168
and we've had it

18:48.210 --> 18:49.169
with all the yelling!

18:49.211 --> 18:51.089
You are a terrible influence

18:49.211 --> 18:51.089
on us!

18:51.130 --> 18:52.757
All you ever do is scream!

18:52.799 --> 18:54.383
And order us around!

18:54.425 --> 18:56.176
There's something wrong

18:54.425 --> 18:56.176
with this family!

18:56.218 --> 18:57.470
Families should have

18:57.511 --> 19:00.180
some way of communicating

18:57.511 --> 19:00.180
besides yelling!

19:00.222 --> 19:03.267
Okay, everybody,

19:00.222 --> 19:03.267
calm down.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.103
I understand what you're saying.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.562
I am not going to yell.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.355
I am not going to scream.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.190
We are capable

19:08.397 --> 19:10.190
of talking about this

19:10.232 --> 19:12.026
without raising our voices.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.904
Now, boys,

19:13.486 --> 19:14.904
I want you to understand

19:14.946 --> 19:16.489
I am sorry about

19:14.946 --> 19:16.489
what happened,

19:16.530 --> 19:19.867
but you have to understand

19:16.530 --> 19:19.867
I get a little emotional

19:19.909 --> 19:21.911
when I learned

19:19.909 --> 19:21.911
that my oldest son

19:21.953 --> 19:23.496
was acting like an idiot

19:23.537 --> 19:25.123
and throwing his life away.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.540
Now, that doesn't mean...

19:29.919 --> 19:32.379
Stop talking

19:29.919 --> 19:32.379
about him like that!

19:32.421 --> 19:34.548
Francis is my heart!

19:42.140 --> 19:44.017
Okay, we're even.

19:44.058 --> 19:46.393
Everyone's fine and there's

19:44.058 --> 19:46.393
no need for escalation.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.228
Isn't it beautiful

19:46.435 --> 19:48.228
when things work out?

19:48.270 --> 19:50.064
Yeah, I'd say this

19:48.270 --> 19:50.064
has gone pretty well.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.858
I mean, considering we

19:50.106 --> 19:51.858
got off to a rocky start,

19:51.899 --> 19:53.526
we couldn't have asked

19:51.899 --> 19:53.526
for a better ending.

19:53.567 --> 19:58.238
Get your wife out of my sight.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.743
She called you my wife.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.871
That's progress.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.750
So Dad's birthday

20:07.289 --> 20:09.750
wasn't that bad after all.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.251
He got a new back shaver.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.171
We got to eat cake

20:11.293 --> 20:13.171
that was cut by a knife

20:13.212 --> 20:15.506
and Mom has promised

20:13.212 --> 20:15.506
not to yell at us anymore.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.924
Bye, Francis.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.924
Bye, Malcolm.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.551
Happy birthday, Dad.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.136
Thanks, son.

20:20.178 --> 20:21.303
Piama.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.097
Lois.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.265
Anytime you want to finish

20:23.139 --> 20:25.265
our little talk.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.767
I'd like that.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.686
Maybe I'll come for a visit.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.730
Maybe I'll come back down here.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.191
Anytime, anyplace.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.233
Okay, bye.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.233
HAL:

20:33.232 --> 20:34.233
Uh, yeah, yeah, bye.

20:35.193 --> 20:36.110
(Dewey screaming)

20:36.152 --> 20:38.278
Get back here,

20:36.152 --> 20:38.278
you little weasel!

20:38.320 --> 20:39.780
Reese!

20:50.332 --> 20:51.375
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.793
It's all my fault.

20:52.835 --> 20:55.546
I'll clean my room

20:52.835 --> 20:55.546
and do all my homework.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.799
We may want to go back

20:55.588 --> 20:58.799
to the old system.
