Wow! My tulips finally bloomed!

00:40.239 --> 00:42.360
Aren't they amazing, Stanley?

00:42.480 --> 00:44.519
Gulp! You said it, Ollie!

00:44.640 --> 00:46.919
Moon! Moon! Moon!

00:47.080 --> 00:49.080
Sorry, I was brushing my teeth and--

00:49.199 --> 00:52.919
Oh, wow! Your tulips finally
bloomed! Congratulations, Ollie.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.599
They're wonderful!

00:54.720 --> 00:57.400
Except... where are the yellow ones?

00:57.559 --> 01:00.480
I'm sure I planted yellow ones,
but none came up.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.720
It's just not spring without them.

01:02.839 --> 01:04.000
Don't worry, Ollie.

01:04.160 --> 01:09.280
We'll find them, because
I am having... a brainstorm!

01:09.440 --> 01:11.360
Uh-oh. When you have a brainstorm,

01:11.520 --> 01:14.240
it usually means
I get dragged off somewhere!

01:14.360 --> 01:16.280
No need to be sad, Ollie!

01:16.399 --> 01:18.479
We'll just pop over to the Netherlands

01:18.600 --> 01:20.240
and get you those yellow tulips.

01:20.360 --> 01:23.320
Ollie, something I've got to tell you.

01:23.520 --> 01:25.839
I... I...

01:25.960 --> 01:28.200
Never mind!
Let's go get you those yellow tulips,

01:28.360 --> 01:30.600
take our minds off things!

01:30.720 --> 01:32.839
Come on, Ollie, what do you say?

01:33.640 --> 01:35.839
OK. I'll just need to pack first.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.080
But don't worry, I'll keep it light.

01:38.920 --> 01:39.960
Ready!

01:40.800 --> 01:41.720
-Whoa!
-Let's go!

01:41.880 --> 01:43.039
Your tulips are waiting!

01:48.800 --> 01:50.600
Whoo!

01:51.000 --> 01:53.039
Whee!

01:58.440 --> 02:03.640
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we are now entering the Netherlands.</i>

02:03.839 --> 02:04.919
Yay.

02:10.039 --> 02:11.840
Wow! Cool place.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.519
Uh-huh. Where are the tulips?

02:14.680 --> 02:16.560
Don't know. Let's try that way!

02:18.200 --> 02:20.480
-Ready, Ollie?
-No.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.040
Run!

02:22.600 --> 02:24.400
Run? Aw...

02:25.280 --> 02:26.600
Watch it! Hey!

02:29.799 --> 02:33.799
Wow! I've never seen so many
bicycles! This is my kinda town!

02:33.959 --> 02:36.920
Found the tulips! Says here they're...

02:37.120 --> 02:38.440
Whoa!

02:40.000 --> 02:44.160
-Scoot? Is that you?
-Ugh! Ollie! Moon! Hi!

02:44.600 --> 02:46.160
What are you doing here, Scoot?

02:46.320 --> 02:48.799
-Are you lost again?
-Scoot Jackson lost?

02:48.959 --> 02:52.760
Not any more! Thanks to
my super-special super GPS.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.280
-Cool!
-How's it work?

02:54.440 --> 02:57.280
I just tell my super-special super GPS

02:57.519 --> 02:59.320
where I would like to go.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.760
Let's see, what's next
on my explorer list?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.280
-Oh, yeah, to see some tulips.
-Excellent choice.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.880
I just type it in. And then
I follow the arrow on the screen

03:09.000 --> 03:09.880
till I get there.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.120
Wanna see while I grab a picture?

03:13.280 --> 03:14.519
Nice gizmo,

03:14.679 --> 03:17.160
but look at the fabulous
rubber safety cover it's in.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.359
Wonder if it bounces?

03:23.959 --> 03:25.720
-Yup. Does.
-Moon!

03:25.880 --> 03:28.799
You just lost Scoot's
super-special super GPS!

03:28.959 --> 03:31.440
And he's going to be
super-specially upset!

03:31.560 --> 03:33.880
-We have to do something!
-Like what?

03:34.040 --> 03:37.160
-Pretend your phone is the GPS?
-Genius plan, Ollie!

03:37.280 --> 03:39.920
What? No! We can't really do that!

03:40.480 --> 03:41.359
Just did!

03:42.200 --> 03:45.399
What do you think? Super special, right?

03:45.560 --> 03:47.000
[nervous laugh]
Sure is.

03:47.239 --> 03:51.239
Well, just going to follow
this arrow to the tulip fields.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.640
So long!

03:52.799 --> 03:54.679
He didn't notice. That's good.

03:54.920 --> 03:59.040
This way? If you say so,
super-special super GPS!

03:59.200 --> 04:00.119
[gasp]

04:03.839 --> 04:07.359
But now that fake GPS is taking him
in the <i>wrong </i>direction!

04:07.959 --> 04:09.239
And that's bad!

04:09.600 --> 04:11.920
Hey, guys! Everything good?

04:13.799 --> 04:16.320
-No? What happened?
-We lost Scoot's GPS

04:16.479 --> 04:18.120
and replaced it with a fake one.

04:18.279 --> 04:20.479
We couldn't bring ourselves
to tell him the truth!

04:20.719 --> 04:21.680
[gulps]

04:21.839 --> 04:23.640
Yeah, sometimes it is hard

04:23.800 --> 04:25.640
to tell a friend when you make a mistake.

04:26.039 --> 04:28.120
And now, instead of getting my tulips,

04:28.280 --> 04:30.479
we have to catch Scoot
and get him back on track.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.599
Come on! Before he gets away!

04:33.960 --> 04:34.800
Let's use this!

04:36.200 --> 04:37.599
-And these!
-Um...

04:40.039 --> 04:42.719
Ollie, ready to beat this traffic?

04:42.840 --> 04:44.000
Not really!

04:49.200 --> 04:51.520
Moon, look! There he is!

04:51.640 --> 04:54.479
Good job, Ollie! Now all we have
to do is spin Scoot around

04:54.640 --> 04:56.640
so he goes back towards the tulips. Easy!

05:03.640 --> 05:05.640
Fish sticks! Where's he going now?

05:05.760 --> 05:06.880
From the side of the bus,

05:07.039 --> 05:08.760
it looks like he's on his way
to see a windmill.

05:08.919 --> 05:10.400
Follow that bus!

05:16.000 --> 05:18.560
[panting]

05:19.280 --> 05:21.159
Oh, no! Scoot's getting away!

05:21.640 --> 05:23.599
Maybe there's a shortcut to the windmill.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.159
I'll check my map.

05:26.919 --> 05:28.039
Got it! Turn here!

05:28.760 --> 05:30.080
Whoa!

05:31.719 --> 05:34.240
Listen. I sound like a motorboat!

05:34.400 --> 05:35.680
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!

05:35.800 --> 05:36.640
[giggles]

05:39.880 --> 05:42.080
Is this a shortcut or a carnival ride?

05:42.640 --> 05:44.039
Look! There's the bus!

05:44.800 --> 05:47.240
If we go across the field,
we can catch up to him.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.039
Come on!

05:51.159 --> 05:52.880
[panting]

05:53.560 --> 05:54.479
This is hopeless!

05:54.599 --> 05:55.880
I'll never see my tulips.

05:56.039 --> 05:59.159
I wish you'd never lost
that super-special super GPS.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.800
Well, I wish you'd never had
one of your genius plans

06:01.960 --> 06:02.840
to make a fake one.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.200
Um... guys?

06:04.359 --> 06:07.960
Well, I wish <i>you'd </i>never had
a brainstorm to come here.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.479
-Guys?
-Well, I wish

06:09.640 --> 06:12.200
you'd never planted tulips
in the first place!

06:12.320 --> 06:16.039
Guys! I hate to interrupt this
important blaming, but look!

06:16.520 --> 06:18.080
We made it!

06:20.640 --> 06:21.960
Whoa!

06:23.359 --> 06:25.479
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

06:25.680 --> 06:29.919
Wow! That windmill is gorgeous!
Isn't it just so graceful?

06:30.039 --> 06:32.960
Except for that weird,
dangly, doggy-shaped part.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.919
-What is that?
-Straight ahead? Still?

06:36.080 --> 06:39.960
Huh! If you say so,
super-special super GPS.

06:40.359 --> 06:43.159
You gotta be pullin' my tulips.
What do we do?

06:43.280 --> 06:45.880
I am having a brainstorm!

06:46.000 --> 06:47.320
Oh, no!

06:51.919 --> 06:55.039
Huh? Moon, look! Tulips!

06:59.680 --> 07:04.000
-Not now, Ollie!
-Not now? But they're so close!

07:04.159 --> 07:05.599
Just hang on!

07:05.840 --> 07:07.039
Whoo!

07:10.520 --> 07:11.719
Yes!

07:13.320 --> 07:14.760
-No!
-No!

07:18.799 --> 07:24.200
I can't... believe...
we're chasing that bus... again.

07:24.359 --> 07:26.560
So... tired...

07:26.719 --> 07:30.359
What can I do? I know!
I'll shout out encouragements!

07:30.520 --> 07:32.919
Pedal harder!
My grandmother's faster than you

07:33.080 --> 07:34.440
and she's a snail!

07:35.320 --> 07:37.479
How's that? Better? Working?

07:38.599 --> 07:40.120
-Mmm.
-Ollie?

07:40.280 --> 07:43.719
I know I was mad at you before,
but I really wish you had

07:43.880 --> 07:46.159
one of your genius plans
to help us out of this.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.599
And I wish <i>you </i>had
one of your great brainstorms.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.440
I know I complain about them, Moon,

07:51.560 --> 07:53.799
but they're one of my favourite
things about you.

07:54.039 --> 07:57.239
When you think about it, Ollie,
we <i>are </i>a pretty good team.

07:57.359 --> 08:00.440

Grab a costume and try to blend in!

08:50.319 --> 08:53.160
I can't see Scoot. What a disaster!

08:53.319 --> 08:56.319
We've lost our friend and
we never even got the tulips.

08:56.439 --> 08:58.000

10:30.360 --> 10:32.480
Guys, I have to say our adventure

10:32.600 --> 10:34.199
has kind of inspired me.

10:34.360 --> 10:35.920
I have a confession to make.

10:36.079 --> 10:38.959
-What is it, Stanley?
-Well, the truth is, Ollie...

10:39.120 --> 10:40.959
I ate your yellow tulips.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.959
I'm really sorry. I should've
been honest about my mistake.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.560
-Can you ever forgive me?
-Definitely.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.040
In fact, you know what?

10:49.199 --> 10:52.560
From now on, you can eat as many
yellow tulips as you like.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.880
Thanks for my yellow tulips, Moon.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.040
Thanks for the adventure, Ollie.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.000
Hmm.
