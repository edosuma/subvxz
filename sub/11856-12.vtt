WEBVTT

00:15.792 --> 00:19.667
(female #1)
'Dawn, what a paper
you wrote. What a..'

00:19.750 --> 00:21.333
You don't smoke.

00:21.417 --> 00:24.792
Not you. Detention.

00:31.834 --> 00:34.208
Bad attitude, Mr. Litvack.
Detention.

00:45.667 --> 00:49.333
- What are you doin' in here?
- Studying.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.166
Detention, this afternoon.

01:02.041 --> 01:04.083
That took some work.

01:05.709 --> 01:07.750
Uh, yeah, sir.

01:07.834 --> 01:09.417
How did you get it all up there?

01:09.500 --> 01:12.959
- Glue stick.
- Where did you get that?

01:13.041 --> 01:14.875
This is the one who..

01:14.959 --> 01:18.166
Suicide.
Committed suicide.

01:18.250 --> 01:19.917
And this is school property.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.709
Detention, this afternoon.

02:26.792 --> 02:28.125
What did Brattman have to say?

02:28.208 --> 02:30.792
- Ah, new info on a case.
- Which?

02:30.875 --> 02:32.333
Kid named Trevor Dawson.

02:32.417 --> 02:35.500
Died in '94 falling from
the roof of his high
school.

02:35.583 --> 02:36.542
Accident?

02:36.625 --> 02:38.417
Oh, Northwest
handled it as a suicide.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.041
This note was
found
on Trevor's body.

02:42.375 --> 02:43.834
"I want my parents to know

02:43.917 --> 02:45.917
"that I don't regret
what I'm doing.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.333
"It may seem extreme

02:47.417 --> 02:49.083
"but it's the best for everyone.

02:49.166 --> 02:50.333
Trevor Dawson."

02:50.417 --> 02:52.500
Suicide note.
Sounds straightforward.

02:52.583 --> 02:54.250
Only now,
we have the other half.

02:54.333 --> 02:56.291
Custodian at Trevor's
high school just died.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.667
Landlord calls the cops when
he finds the guy's apartment

02:58.750 --> 03:01.375
full of creepy
high school memorabilia..

03:01.458 --> 03:02.500
...including this.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.208
(Stillman)
'"May 13th, '94.'

03:04.291 --> 03:06.917
This is TD,
writing from a scary spot."

03:07.000 --> 03:08.333
Looks like the same handwriting.

03:08.417 --> 03:10.041
"I want you to know
that I'm in danger.

03:10.125 --> 03:11.542
"If something
happens to me today

03:11.625 --> 03:13.709
please tell my parents
I love them."

03:13.792 --> 03:15.500
This new note ends there.

03:15.583 --> 03:17.834
Oh, put the two pieces together.

03:19.041 --> 03:20.542
(Vera)
'Same page ripped in half.'

03:20.625 --> 03:21.750
Top of the note, Trevor says

03:21.834 --> 03:23.417
he's in danger,
he knows he's gonna die.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.959
(Vera)
What kind of kid was this?

03:25.041 --> 03:27.875
- He run with a bad crowd?
- No record, no drugs.

03:27.959 --> 03:30.417
So why would someone
wanna kill a high school
kid

03:30.500 --> 03:32.083
no record, no drugs, nothing?

03:32.166 --> 03:33.750
Why would a high school kid,
no record

03:33.834 --> 03:36.166
no drugs problems
wanna kill himself?

04:11.291 --> 04:13.458
So yesterday, I look over.

04:13.542 --> 04:15.959
I see a telephone
message from Miller.

04:16.041 --> 04:18.542
Today, gone, whisked away.

04:20.333 --> 04:21.625
That's crazy.

04:21.709 --> 04:24.208
'Cause of the content.

04:24.291 --> 04:25.375
It says

04:25.458 --> 04:28.291
"Veronica,
about Wednesday night."

04:28.375 --> 04:29.458
Veronica?

04:29.542 --> 04:30.542
Wednesday night
is the only
night

04:30.625 --> 04:33.959
Miller can work, strict rule.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.458
- I don't know, man.
- Oh, I know.

04:37.542 --> 04:39.667
- How you doing?
- 'What's up?'

04:39.750 --> 04:41.709
- Alright.
- 'What do you got?'

04:41.792 --> 04:44.959
Well, day he died, Trevor
Dawson
was in after-school detention

04:45.041 --> 04:47.291
'at Westmoreland High
from three to six.'

04:47.375 --> 04:49.959
Autopsy puts his death
just before six.

04:50.041 --> 04:51.583
What did the other
kids in detention
say?

04:51.667 --> 04:54.542
Dawn Hill, Boris Litvack
and Raquel Montero.

04:54.625 --> 04:55.834
All of them said
Trevor slipped out

04:55.917 --> 04:57.375
just before
detention's over.

04:57.458 --> 04:59.000
A few minutes later,
they're leavin'

04:59.083 --> 05:00.291
he's dead in the parking lot.

05:00.375 --> 05:01.917
Well, worth
talking
to them again.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Not teenagers anymore.
They could be more forthcoming.

05:05.083 --> 05:06.500
There a teacher
watching this
detention?

05:06.583 --> 05:09.917
A Mr. Abe Monti,
died in a car wreck, 2002.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Back in '94, he tells
the kids he's stepping out

05:12.083 --> 05:13.333
for a few minutes,
falls asleep

05:13.417 --> 05:14.834
in the teacher's lounge instead.

05:14.917 --> 05:16.875
Anything helpful on
the school security
tape?

05:16.959 --> 05:19.250
Tape runs out before
Trevor leaves detention.

05:21.583 --> 05:24.250
Gives you the chilling glimpse
back into high school, though.

05:24.333 --> 05:25.667
Pretty much it
for the whole tape.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.959
Sitting, eyeballing each other.

05:28.041 --> 05:29.875
We should visit
Trevor's
parents.

05:29.959 --> 05:31.375
Let them know
we're looking into this
again.

05:31.458 --> 05:32.792
And be sensitive.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.458
Don't wanna get
their hopes up for nothing.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.583
You think the murder angle
will get their hopes up?

05:36.667 --> 05:38.458
They lose their son either way.

05:38.542 --> 05:41.875
Him being murdered means
maybe it ain't their fault.

05:48.375 --> 05:50.750
That's his handwriting, it is.

05:50.834 --> 05:52.625
"I am in danger."

05:52.709 --> 05:55.583
Does that mean anything
to you, Mr. and Mrs. Dawson?

05:55.667 --> 05:57.375
I don't know who he
could be in danger
from

05:57.458 --> 06:00.291
but I do know that
it never made sense to
me

06:00.375 --> 06:02.041
that Trevor would kill himself.

06:02.125 --> 06:04.208
He never said
anything like that?

06:04.291 --> 06:07.500
No, he didn't say too much
to us anyway, round then.

06:07.583 --> 06:09.041
(Mr. Dawson)
'He was in a phase, yeah.'

06:09.125 --> 06:11.375
'Moody, locking
himself up in his room.'

06:11.458 --> 06:13.750
But, to go that far

06:13.834 --> 06:15.792
he would have really
had to have been
hurting.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.542
And we would have seen that.

06:18.625 --> 06:20.417
What was it like
for Trevor at school?

06:20.500 --> 06:23.917
- Any enemies?
- I don't think so.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.458
Yeah, he didn't
really have any friends.

06:25.542 --> 06:27.917
He didn't fit the popular mold.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.750
He was a creative type,
that's why. Very
sensitive.

06:30.834 --> 06:33.250
- 'Very.'
- How do you mean?

06:33.333 --> 06:35.750
You know this Kurt
Cobain
from the band Nirvana?

06:35.834 --> 06:37.333
Killed himself. Yeah.

06:37.417 --> 06:40.709
After he did, Trevor
wouldn't
leave his room for a week.

06:40.792 --> 06:43.667
A few weeks after that, he died.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.166
We tried to be caring
about this Cobain
thing

06:46.250 --> 06:49.375
but, well, I
myself
didn't totally
get it.

06:50.500 --> 06:51.917
Trevor's
spray-painting has left
me

06:52.000 --> 06:54.709
with a major
cleaning job on my
hands.

06:54.792 --> 06:58.000
Not to mention the landscaping
that Trevor set on fire.

06:58.083 --> 07:01.333
Fletch Canalli
kicked my candle over.

07:01.417 --> 07:03.375
That wasn't me.
I was making a memorial.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.834
- What were you thinking?
- Chuck.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.917
Kurt Cobain died, dad.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.792
Is he a friend of yours?
What happened?

07:11.875 --> 07:13.959
One of his rock
stars
killed himself.

07:14.041 --> 07:15.834
It's the one that
wears
all the layers of
clothes.

07:15.917 --> 07:18.583
Oh, great. That's great.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.792
- Why are you acting out?
- I'm not.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.583
You risked getting expelled

07:24.667 --> 07:26.041
for a guy who wears makeup

07:26.125 --> 07:28.667
gets high on drugs
and takes his own life.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.917
This is your hero? Huh?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.125
I mean, I know you
don't like sports..

07:32.208 --> 07:33.625
Oh, please.

07:33.709 --> 07:37.083
If you are using drugs,
let's just deal with it.

07:37.166 --> 07:39.750
It's the music, okay?

07:39.834 --> 07:42.417
It's his songs.
It's not drugs, mom.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.208
The first time
I ever heard his music

07:47.291 --> 07:50.083
was the first time I ever
felt like I wasn't alone.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.083
You are not alone, Trevor.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.291
It's on his senior page.

08:06.917 --> 08:08.959
Kurt Cobain.

08:11.583 --> 08:13.500
- Can we, uh, take this?
- Yeah.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.625
You know, I was big
on Led Zeppelin

08:16.709 --> 08:19.500
but I never would have
offed myself for them.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.750
'You see what I mean?'

08:20.834 --> 08:21.959
So you never bought that

08:22.041 --> 08:23.875
to pushing
Trevor
over the edge.

08:23.959 --> 08:26.166
After he died,
our phone bill came
back

08:26.250 --> 08:27.750
and there was page
after page of him

08:27.834 --> 08:30.250
calling some teen hotline.

08:30.333 --> 08:31.917
Crisis hotline kind of thing?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.458
That was the one thing
that made us think

08:33.542 --> 08:36.375
that maybe he was
really having dark thoughts.

08:36.458 --> 08:39.834
But it was too late
by then, obviously.

08:44.208 --> 08:47.208
(Jeffries)
Teen hotline Trevor called
wasn't just for suicidal
kids.

08:47.291 --> 08:48.709
It was for any kind of crisis.

08:48.792 --> 08:51.542
So he could have talked about
what he was in danger from.

08:51.625 --> 08:53.875
Possible, but they can't
give out transcripts.

08:53.959 --> 08:55.542
Protecting caller privacy.

08:55.625 --> 08:57.333
I got the call
logs
from the months

08:57.417 --> 08:58.750
before Trevor's death.

08:58.834 --> 09:02.041
Look at this.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.500
One of the volunteers
is named Dawn H.

09:04.583 --> 09:05.959
Like Dawn Hill.

09:06.041 --> 09:08.542
This the same girl who
was in detention with Trevor

09:08.625 --> 09:09.917
the day he died?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.083
Bet they're one and the same.

09:11.166 --> 09:13.792
I wonder if
that's
a coincidence.

09:20.291 --> 09:21.917
Yes, that was me.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.125
I talked to Trevor Dawson
on the teen hotline once.

09:25.208 --> 09:27.417
You were trained to talk
to kids who were suicidal?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.083
Kids in any kind of crisis.

09:29.166 --> 09:30.542
Pretty coincidental

09:30.625 --> 09:32.792
you and Trevor winding up
in detention together.

09:32.875 --> 09:34.458
The one time
I ever got detention.

09:34.542 --> 09:38.375
- Was the day Trevor died.
- Yeah.

09:38.458 --> 09:40.625
- So you two knew each other.
- Not really.

09:40.709 --> 09:43.291
Teen hotline was anonymous,
first-name basis only.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.959
Very strict rules about that.

09:45.041 --> 09:47.542
But you knew he was the same
Trevor that day in detention.

09:47.625 --> 09:48.917
I figured it out

09:49.000 --> 09:51.125
but I don't think
he knew I was the same Dawn.

09:51.208 --> 09:54.667
Trevor wrote a note that day.
Said he was in danger.

09:54.750 --> 09:57.291
Danger? Really?

09:57.375 --> 09:58.500
He didn't talk about that?

09:58.583 --> 10:01.291
You mean on the teen hotline?

10:01.375 --> 10:03.792
Not that I should tell you,
but no.

10:03.875 --> 10:06.625
- What about in detention?
- We didn't talk.

10:06.709 --> 10:10.500
- Nobody said anything?
- Nothing of substance.

10:10.583 --> 10:12.291
It wasn't like
"The Breakfast Club."

10:12.375 --> 10:15.250
It was like high school.

10:21.875 --> 10:25.083
- What is that?
- College book.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.625
It has, like, every college
and what you need to get in.

10:27.709 --> 10:28.834
Can I see it?

10:28.917 --> 10:31.125
What do you need? Money?

10:31.208 --> 10:33.041
Grades, activities

10:33.125 --> 10:35.125
good SAT scores, sports

10:35.208 --> 10:36.667
leadership stuff.

10:36.750 --> 10:38.542
SAT scores are racist.

10:38.625 --> 10:40.709
- Did you hear that?
- I got a 1420.

10:40.792 --> 10:42.750
And I got an 1180

10:42.834 --> 10:46.333
so I guess,
there goes that theory, huh?

10:46.417 --> 10:50.375
No way. This place has
classes on Japanese poetry.

10:50.458 --> 10:51.500
You should apply.

10:51.583 --> 10:54.083
It's $28,000 a year to go there.

10:54.166 --> 10:56.417
Well, maybe if you'd done
better on your SATs

10:56.500 --> 10:59.291
you could get
a scholarship but whatever.

10:59.375 --> 11:01.125
- Yeah, whatever.
- You guys?

11:01.208 --> 11:04.291
Please don't talk.
You know the rules.

11:04.375 --> 11:07.750
I had those loafers when I was
in, like, the second grade.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.583
Girls.

11:09.667 --> 11:12.166
You have a little
lipstick, like..

11:12.250 --> 11:13.375
...all over your face.

11:13.458 --> 11:16.041
No! Does that mean
I'm not pretty?

11:16.125 --> 11:18.375
'Does this mean I'm cut
from the dance squad?'

11:18.458 --> 11:19.667
Mr. Monti?

11:19.750 --> 11:21.166
If you had to choose
which one of us

11:21.250 --> 11:23.542
could be your kid,
would you choose me or Dawn?

11:23.625 --> 11:25.625
Mr. Litvack, silence.

11:25.709 --> 11:27.834
He didn't wanna
hurt your feelings.

11:27.917 --> 11:30.750
- Ha.
- You know what you need, Dawn?

11:30.834 --> 11:34.208
To get high.
Come over to my place.

11:34.291 --> 11:36.000
I can have my mom
call your mom

11:36.083 --> 11:38.542
and say it's okay
for you to sleep over.

11:38.625 --> 11:41.750
- She'll do it, too.
- Boris, you do this every
time!

11:43.500 --> 11:45.542
I'm going to
the teacher's lounge

11:45.625 --> 11:46.917
to get an aspirin.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.500
While I am gone, do me a favor

11:48.583 --> 11:50.750
and just consider why it is

11:50.834 --> 11:53.917
you insist on being
cruel to one another.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.458
Because it's high school
and we hate ourselves?

11:56.542 --> 11:59.250
Mr. Dawson, the corner.

11:59.333 --> 12:01.500
You know
you're being recorded.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.583
So behave.

12:10.750 --> 12:13.417
So the detention monitor

12:13.500 --> 12:14.875
he made Trevor sit
in the corner?

12:14.959 --> 12:16.834
Yeah.

12:16.917 --> 12:18.583
I think so.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.000
That's what you said.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.417
Well, then, yes.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.959
If I remember correctly.

12:24.041 --> 12:26.166
Why, does that mean something?

12:30.166 --> 12:32.000
Thanks for your time, Dawn.

12:36.417 --> 12:37.834
The Trevor Dawson on this tape

12:37.917 --> 12:38.959
is not sitting in the corner

12:39.041 --> 12:40.375
where Dawn said he was.

12:40.458 --> 12:41.959
If he moved after ten minutes

12:42.041 --> 12:43.333
this tape won't show it.

12:43.417 --> 12:45.250
This tape runs for three hours.

12:45.333 --> 12:46.500
Sort of.

12:46.583 --> 12:48.834
Take a look.

12:48.917 --> 12:50.000
See here?

12:50.083 --> 12:52.125
This girl's got
her hands
folded.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.458
- What happened there?
- It's a cut.

12:56.542 --> 12:57.458
What do you mean?

12:57.542 --> 12:58.875
This tape runs on a loop.

12:58.959 --> 13:01.291
'First ten minutes
over and over.'

13:01.375 --> 13:04.291
- How'd this get missed in
'94?
- It's good work.

13:04.375 --> 13:05.333
Well orchestrated.

13:05.417 --> 13:06.458
"Well orchestrated" meaning

13:06.542 --> 13:08.125
they sit still on purpose?

13:08.208 --> 13:09.750
That's why the tape works.

13:09.834 --> 13:11.458
So the kids were in
on faking the tape?

13:11.542 --> 13:14.166
Which means they were
all in on faking their
alibi.

13:14.250 --> 13:15.375
The loop tape makes it look like

13:15.458 --> 13:16.875
they were all
sitting in detention

13:16.959 --> 13:18.166
'quietly studying.'

13:18.250 --> 13:21.625
Not pushing
Trevor Dawson off the roof.

13:26.750 --> 13:29.291
Looks like those kids
in detention cooperated

13:29.375 --> 13:31.583
to make the fake security tape.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.792
Conspiracy to keep anyone
from seeing the hours

13:33.875 --> 13:35.000
before Trevor Dawson died?

13:35.083 --> 13:36.875
Why would those kids
wanna kill Trevor?

13:36.959 --> 13:39.834
Well, kids in detention
are usually troubled types.

13:39.917 --> 13:42.917
Who knows what's brewing
in the hormone-addled brain?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I took a look at their files.

13:45.083 --> 13:47.291
One of them has a record.

13:47.375 --> 13:48.625
"Boris Litvack."

13:48.709 --> 13:51.166
Assortment of
drug-related charges.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.333
Plus nine months for DVD piracy.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.000
The kid's got
technical know-how.

13:55.083 --> 13:57.291
Let's see if he'll own up
to making this tape.

13:58.875 --> 14:01.583
Hey, V.
Hi.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.834
'I know, I know,
I'm sorry.'

14:03.917 --> 14:05.542
'How'd it go?'

14:09.166 --> 14:11.500
(Valens)
'Boris Litvack?'

14:11.583 --> 14:13.542
'Philly PD.'

14:13.625 --> 14:16.500
She's gonna be all over
the manager about this.

14:16.583 --> 14:19.125
Your boss know
you got a record, Boris?

14:19.208 --> 14:21.458
Yeah. Must disclose.

14:21.542 --> 14:23.625
But here at the Dunk N'
Glaze,
we don't discriminate.

14:23.709 --> 14:25.709
Well, what about
a murder charge?

14:25.792 --> 14:28.166
That something
that'd get you fired?

14:28.250 --> 14:29.250
I'm guessin'.

14:29.333 --> 14:30.333
Then maybe you feel
like telling us

14:30.417 --> 14:31.709
the truth about Trevor Dawson.

14:31.792 --> 14:34.083
Kid did himself in.
He jumped off the
roof.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.834
Well, we got another idea.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.208
And we think you,
Raquel Montero and Dawn Hill

14:38.291 --> 14:41.500
used detention as an alibi
so you could off Trevor.

14:41.583 --> 14:43.000
Whoa.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.417
I encourage you to not let your
imagination spin out of control.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.375
I knew the kid from detention.

14:47.458 --> 14:50.125
Didn't have some murderous
relationship with him.

14:50.208 --> 14:51.583
You were the only one
in that room who knew

14:51.667 --> 14:53.333
how to mess around with
electronics, make that tape.

14:53.417 --> 14:54.625
Reason it keeps
popping in our head

14:54.709 --> 14:55.792
is you don't want anyone to know

14:55.875 --> 14:57.917
you were throwing
Trevor off the roof.

14:59.583 --> 15:01.834
I made the tape
to cover my ass.

15:01.917 --> 15:03.959
(Vera)
'For what?'

15:04.041 --> 15:05.667
Trevor and I
snuck
out of detention

15:05.750 --> 15:08.333
to lift sulfuric acid
from the chem
classroom.

15:09.333 --> 15:11.583
Why'd you need sulfuric acid?

15:13.500 --> 15:14.750
I was gonna make Ecstasy.

15:14.834 --> 15:17.208
You're a model citizen
there, Boris.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.291
Well, I didn't have a lot
of follow-through back
then

15:19.375 --> 15:20.875
so I never did
it,
rest assured.

15:20.959 --> 15:24.000
But...that's why
I made the tape.

15:24.083 --> 15:26.000
Why'd the girls
go along with it?

15:26.083 --> 15:27.792
Raquel did
whatever Trevor
did

15:27.875 --> 15:31.166
and Dawn didn't really
know what was going on.

15:37.333 --> 15:40.458
All these labels are,
like, scientific

15:40.542 --> 15:42.333
and I can't read any of them.

15:42.417 --> 15:45.583
(Trevor)
'Dawn, do you know the chemical
formula for sulfuric acid?'

15:45.667 --> 15:46.709
Can you find it?

15:46.792 --> 15:48.583
Are you guys sure
Monti is passed out?

15:48.667 --> 15:50.709
cannot

15:50.792 --> 15:52.166
Relax, Hill.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.083
Look at this.

15:56.041 --> 15:58.333
Yes, dude, take that.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.291
Are you out of your mind?

16:02.375 --> 16:04.542
Uh, yeah,
'cause I need a ciggy.

16:04.625 --> 16:05.500
Put it out.

16:05.583 --> 16:08.333
You're gonna get us caught.

16:17.125 --> 16:18.875
Keep it down, Montero.

16:18.959 --> 16:21.083
You know what they're saying
about your hero, Trev?

16:21.166 --> 16:22.500
Shh. What?

16:22.583 --> 16:23.542
That Courtney did it to him

16:23.625 --> 16:26.000
because he wanted a divorce.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.041
She's crazy. I love her.

16:28.125 --> 16:29.792
She's like,
"You're never leaving me."

16:29.875 --> 16:32.000
Are you just really freaked
out
about what we're doing?

16:32.083 --> 16:33.250
I know it's scary--

16:33.333 --> 16:35.166
Have you just, like,
moved on from me or what?

16:36.333 --> 16:38.625
There is nothing
to move on from.

16:38.709 --> 16:40.875
You are such a liar.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.667
'Seriously.'

16:42.750 --> 16:44.959
I held you in my arms
and we listened to Kurt

16:45.041 --> 16:46.625
and you-you cried.

16:46.709 --> 16:48.875
It was the day he died.

16:48.959 --> 16:50.625
I can't believe
I ever told you to hang on

16:50.709 --> 16:52.959
like I cared
if you lived or died.

16:53.041 --> 16:54.625
I take it back.

16:59.041 --> 17:02.000
You're a crazy bitch.

17:03.166 --> 17:05.417
Raquel Montero
was a crazy bitch.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.709
She had a thing for Trevor?

17:07.792 --> 17:10.417
Thought she was
the Courtney to his Kurt.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.875
Where'd you all go
after the science room?

17:11.959 --> 17:13.875
We went our separate ways
till a little before 6:00

17:13.959 --> 17:15.000
when we knew Monti'd come back

17:15.083 --> 17:16.125
and check on us.

17:16.208 --> 17:17.667
How'd you know he'd do that?

17:17.750 --> 17:20.208
That was his detention routine.

17:20.291 --> 17:22.917
Excuse himself,
booze up, snooze

17:23.041 --> 17:24.291
wake up at 6:00.

17:24.375 --> 17:26.750
Where'd Trevor go?

17:26.834 --> 17:28.917
I left campus to stow
the pilfered materials

17:29.000 --> 17:29.959
away in my house.

17:30.041 --> 17:31.417
'When I came back to detention'

17:31.500 --> 17:32.834
Trevor was already dead.

17:32.917 --> 17:34.166
Well, you think
he could have been

17:34.250 --> 17:35.667
with Raquel while
you were at home?

17:35.750 --> 17:37.458
'She was pretty good
at being wherever he was'

17:37.542 --> 17:38.959
'any given time.'

17:39.041 --> 17:41.375
And you know
what they say about Courtney.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.125
Hello, there.

17:50.125 --> 17:51.834
Are you two from
the neighborhood?

17:51.917 --> 17:53.291
Raquel Montero?

17:53.375 --> 17:55.959
You remember a kid
named Trevor Dawson?

17:56.041 --> 17:57.709
I'm in the
middle
of work here.

17:57.792 --> 18:00.458
And we're in the middle
of a murder investigation.

18:06.291 --> 18:08.375
I thought Trevor
committed suicide.

18:08.458 --> 18:09.959
We know about the tape, Raquel.

18:10.041 --> 18:12.083
We know you four didn't
stay in detention that
day.

18:12.166 --> 18:15.500
Which means you have
no alibi for when Trevor
died.

18:17.375 --> 18:21.041
Nothing like cops yelling at
you
to make you feel 16 again.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.375
Well, way we hear it,
you were obsessed with
Trevor.

18:23.458 --> 18:26.750
Thought you were
the Courtney to his
Kurt.

18:26.834 --> 18:28.125
Who told you that?

18:28.208 --> 18:29.834
It was Boris Litvack, wasn't it?

18:29.917 --> 18:32.291
Well, it can feel
pretty bad at that age..

18:32.375 --> 18:34.458
...getting rejected
by a boy you like.

18:34.542 --> 18:36.500
And when the boy you like would
rather kill himself

18:36.583 --> 18:39.625
than kiss you,
that feels bad, too.

18:39.709 --> 18:41.083
So what did you do?

18:41.166 --> 18:43.667
Wrote in my journal and cried.
I didn't push anybody.

18:43.750 --> 18:46.166
So you weren't afraid
of Trevor moving on, then?

18:46.250 --> 18:47.375
Afraid for him.

18:47.458 --> 18:48.625
Afraid of that bitch, Dawn Hill

18:48.709 --> 18:50.333
pulverizing his heart.

18:50.417 --> 18:51.583
Dawn Hill?

18:51.667 --> 18:54.333
Dawn Hill was
Trevor's secret girlfriend

18:54.417 --> 18:56.083
'in 1994.'

18:56.166 --> 18:59.709
Oh, yes, you heard me.
"Secret."

19:03.583 --> 19:04.625
Hey, do you have
to be so loud?

19:04.709 --> 19:06.166
Yeah.

19:06.250 --> 19:07.792
You're gonna wake up Monti
and then we're all gonna

19:07.875 --> 19:09.625
have detention till
we're, like, dead.

19:09.709 --> 19:11.667
You think he bought us
hating each other?

19:11.750 --> 19:12.875
Definitely.

19:15.917 --> 19:17.458
Principal Ellis
made me take down Kurt

19:17.542 --> 19:19.792
so I put this up instead.

19:19.875 --> 19:22.458
- See how beautiful you are?
- Oh, God.

19:22.542 --> 19:25.166
Take that down.
People will see it.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.583
- Why does that matter?
- You know why.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.125
I can't remember.

19:29.208 --> 19:32.291
It has to be just us.

19:32.375 --> 19:35.041
Hello?
Yeah, I know, too.

19:35.125 --> 19:36.417
And you won't tell.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.834
I'm blocking all of
this out, believe me.

19:38.917 --> 19:40.417
'I don't wanna
live a lie anymore.'

19:40.500 --> 19:43.625
Being with you is the most
real thing I've ever felt

19:43.709 --> 19:45.041
and I'm psyched about it.

19:45.125 --> 19:47.750
Look, what's between
you and me is a secret.

19:47.834 --> 19:51.792
- Drama.
- Yes! Bitch.

19:53.291 --> 19:56.000
I told you
Rex Tyson had a gun.

19:56.083 --> 19:57.542
Yes, you did.

19:57.625 --> 19:58.542
My dad's got a gun

19:58.625 --> 20:00.458
but it's like old from Spain.

20:00.542 --> 20:02.625
I'm taking it.

20:02.709 --> 20:04.542
What?

20:04.625 --> 20:06.792
What's between
you and me is a secret.

20:06.875 --> 20:07.709
Dawn, I--

20:07.792 --> 20:09.500
And it needs to stay that way

20:09.583 --> 20:12.083
or we're dead.

20:12.166 --> 20:13.750
You're dead.

20:25.542 --> 20:28.083
- Why would Dawn want a gun?
- I don't know.

20:28.166 --> 20:29.792
But girlfriend was worked up.

20:29.875 --> 20:32.417
But none of Dawn's friends knew
she and Trevor were together?

20:32.500 --> 20:33.417
No.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.583
That was her whole thing.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.375
Reputation,
reputation, reputation.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.959
Do you think she would kill
to protect her reputation?

20:39.041 --> 20:41.500
It's what you live
and die by in high school.

20:41.583 --> 20:43.166
Excuse me, please.

20:43.250 --> 20:45.250
Hi, can I help you?

20:47.875 --> 20:50.917
Trevor was pushed, not shot.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.959
Holding a gun on a guy is
one way to get him off the
roof.

20:59.333 --> 21:00.709
One thing when
a 17 year-old

21:00.792 --> 21:02.917
keeps her boyfriend
a secret from her friends.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.625
But a 30 year-old
keeping it from the cops?

21:05.709 --> 21:06.750
I'm 28.

21:06.834 --> 21:08.041
Well, you're too old
to not know

21:08.125 --> 21:09.375
what you're dealing
with here, Dawn.

21:09.458 --> 21:12.542
Lying to the police in
a murder investigation.

21:12.625 --> 21:14.917
- You push him, Dawn?
- No.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.125
Maybe it was just an impulse.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.458
Kid pissing you off,
acting like

21:17.542 --> 21:18.834
the world's got to
know about you two

21:18.917 --> 21:20.959
when maybe you're just
trying to get some.

21:21.041 --> 21:23.625
Don't talk about it
like that, alright?

21:23.709 --> 21:24.625
Like what?

21:24.709 --> 21:26.083
Like it didn't mean anything

21:26.166 --> 21:27.375
when it meant everything.

21:27.458 --> 21:30.000
What was a good girl
like you doing with a gun?

21:30.083 --> 21:31.250
I never used that gun.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.000
Not even to
protect
your reputation?

21:33.083 --> 21:35.000
I didn't care
about my
reputation.

21:35.083 --> 21:38.250
I wasn't ashamed of
Trevor.
I loved him.

21:38.333 --> 21:40.375
He's the one who thought
I should have a gun.

21:40.458 --> 21:42.333
Okay, Dawn.

21:42.417 --> 21:44.250
Why's that?

21:44.333 --> 21:47.083
I told him something
that put him in danger.

21:47.166 --> 21:48.667
I didn't mean to, but

21:48.750 --> 21:50.458
I had to tell somebody.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.041
What?

21:52.125 --> 21:54.542
What was happening to me.

21:56.834 --> 21:58.458
Tell us.

22:02.875 --> 22:06.500
We met on the teen
hotline in March.

22:06.583 --> 22:08.875
We talked once and
then everyday after that

22:08.959 --> 22:12.041
he'd call at the same
time and I'd answer.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.959
I miss his voice.

22:17.458 --> 22:20.083
I listened to it.

22:20.166 --> 22:22.917
You're right.
He had a great voice.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.250
You know that song

22:24.333 --> 22:27.709
"Jesus Don't Want
Me For A Sunbeam?"

22:27.792 --> 22:29.667
It's kind of what it's like.

22:29.750 --> 22:31.375
'That's how you feel?'

22:31.458 --> 22:32.333
'Tell me.'

22:32.417 --> 22:35.625
It's like about how like..

22:35.709 --> 22:39.208
...how even God wouldn't
want you in heaven, you know?

22:39.291 --> 22:42.500
'Like nobody thinks
anything of you.'

22:42.583 --> 22:43.875
I do.

22:43.959 --> 22:45.542
'You don't know me, though.'

22:47.959 --> 22:49.208
Believe me

22:49.291 --> 22:51.792
'you wouldn't.'

22:54.166 --> 22:56.125
In English class,
freshman year

22:56.208 --> 22:57.542
Miss Capeci
read somebody's poem

22:57.625 --> 22:59.417
that was supposed
to be anonymous

22:59.500 --> 23:01.250
'about walking in
the parking lot'

23:01.333 --> 23:03.417
'and running your hands
along the fence'

23:03.500 --> 23:06.375
and your fingers going numb.

23:06.458 --> 23:07.667
And just wishing

23:07.750 --> 23:10.250
that the rest of you
would go numb, too.

23:10.333 --> 23:12.250
'I knew it was yours
because I saw'

23:12.333 --> 23:13.709
'the drawings in the margins'

23:13.792 --> 23:16.125
'and that's what you drew
all over your desk.'

23:16.208 --> 23:19.333
When you sat behind me.

23:19.417 --> 23:21.583
Dawn Hill?

23:21.667 --> 23:24.333
You're Dawn Hill
from my high school?

23:24.417 --> 23:25.750
Yeah.

23:25.834 --> 23:28.667
And I think you're a really
great artist and writer,
Trevor.

23:28.750 --> 23:32.041
And I bet you could
even go to art college.

23:32.125 --> 23:34.458
God.

23:34.542 --> 23:37.208
- I'm hanging up.
- Please, don't.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.250
'You, of all people.'

23:38.333 --> 23:40.000
'I mean, you're like..'

23:40.083 --> 23:41.458
...you don't understand.

23:41.542 --> 23:45.333
You think I'm different
from you, but I'm not.

23:45.417 --> 23:47.959
- I think those things, too.
- 'No.'

23:48.041 --> 23:49.875
About..

23:49.959 --> 23:52.125
...not being able to
go on another day.

23:52.208 --> 23:53.625
'But you're Dawn Hill.'

23:53.709 --> 23:55.667
You're gonna have
some perfect life.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.792
'Will you please
just listen to me'

23:57.875 --> 24:01.417
and don't hate me
for what I'm telling you?

24:01.500 --> 24:04.000
Yeah.

24:04.083 --> 24:07.083
I'm scared to go home.

24:10.709 --> 24:13.083
I'm scared because..

24:13.166 --> 24:15.709
...my stepfather
is someone who..

24:17.166 --> 24:19.792
...I don't know
what's wrong with him.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.333
What, Dawn?

24:23.083 --> 24:25.583
I'm afraid I'll never
be able to say..

24:27.291 --> 24:30.709
..."I love you" to anybody..

24:32.000 --> 24:33.709
...because that's
what he says to me.

24:38.083 --> 24:40.917
And he smells horrible.

24:42.417 --> 24:45.875
Like so drunk.

24:45.959 --> 24:47.792
'And when my mom
washes my nightgown'

24:47.875 --> 24:51.500
she goes
"Have you been drinking?"

24:56.333 --> 24:59.709
And I just want to say to her

24:59.792 --> 25:01.709
'"It's your husband.'

25:04.208 --> 25:06.417
He's been in my bed."

25:08.250 --> 25:11.125
- Oh, Dawn.
- Yeah.

25:14.458 --> 25:17.083
- Do you hate me?
- No.

25:18.709 --> 25:20.709
I wanna see you.

25:20.792 --> 25:22.583
In person.

25:26.583 --> 25:28.709
That's why you had the gun.

25:28.792 --> 25:30.125
Your stepdad.

25:30.208 --> 25:31.959
But I couldn't even
bring it into the house.

25:32.041 --> 25:33.542
Did your father
know about Trevor?

25:33.625 --> 25:37.542
My stepdad didn't like me
to have boys in my life.

25:37.625 --> 25:40.166
He was very possessive.

25:40.250 --> 25:41.709
So they never met?

25:41.792 --> 25:43.500
I hope not.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.542
Trevor talked
about it
sometimes.

25:45.625 --> 25:46.917
What do you mean?

25:47.000 --> 25:49.959
He thought he could
reason with my stepfather.

25:50.041 --> 25:53.417
A sweet, naive kid
sitting down with a monster.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.625
'I thought
I'd made him happy.'

25:55.709 --> 25:58.250
Gave him a reason
to live, but..

26:00.166 --> 26:03.458
Trevor's parents never
knew about me either.

26:03.542 --> 26:06.041
They never knew
that somebody loved him.

26:10.542 --> 26:12.709
Dawn's
stepfather
is Philip Hill.

26:12.792 --> 26:15.709
Owns half the commercial
real estate in
Roxborough.

26:15.792 --> 26:17.333
You get anything from DHS?

26:17.417 --> 26:18.834
If he was abusing
his stepdaughter

26:18.917 --> 26:20.709
no one who could've
helped her knew about it.

26:20.792 --> 26:22.333
Thought I might've had
too much time on my hands

26:22.417 --> 26:25.208
flipping through this
thing, but look at this.

26:28.083 --> 26:30.583
(Stillman)
'"Falling from heaven."
What is that?'

26:30.667 --> 26:32.000
Not sure.

26:32.083 --> 26:33.875
But check this out.

26:33.959 --> 26:36.458
(Vera)
'Raquel's page.
Senior message.'

26:36.542 --> 26:40.166
"But beautiful we three are."
Gibberish.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.500
'Now look
at Boris Litvack's page.'

26:42.583 --> 26:44.500
'"Good-bye forever bloody."'

26:44.583 --> 26:45.917
Put it all together
starting with Boris

26:46.000 --> 26:47.625
you get
"Good-bye forever

26:47.709 --> 26:48.709
"bloody but beautiful

26:48.792 --> 26:51.458
we three are
falling from heaven."

26:51.542 --> 26:53.500
The three of them, falling.

26:53.583 --> 26:56.041
"Bloody but
beautiful."
Talking about death.

26:56.125 --> 26:57.709
These three,
it's suicide.

26:57.792 --> 26:58.959
And they're predicting it.

26:59.041 --> 27:02.500
"We three are
falling from heaven."

27:04.375 --> 27:05.291
It's a pact.

27:05.375 --> 27:07.500
(Vera)
'Trevor, Boris, Raquel.'

27:07.583 --> 27:09.792
Trevor's the only one
who took the plunge.

27:11.583 --> 27:13.000
You three all go up on the roof

27:13.083 --> 27:14.917
let Trevor jump
and then call
"psych"?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.500
I wasn't there, man.

27:16.583 --> 27:20.291
What'd you have that made you
want in on this suicide pact?

27:20.375 --> 27:22.583
I was depressed.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.709
What, you don't
remember high school?

27:24.792 --> 27:26.583
Talk to me about
the pact, Boris.

27:26.667 --> 27:28.500
Why did you put it
in the yearbook?

27:28.583 --> 27:29.875
So we wouldn't back out.

27:29.959 --> 27:31.000
Didn't work though.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.667
I didn't have the stones.

27:32.750 --> 27:35.250
Kept thinking of my mom seeing
me with my eyes glazed over

27:35.333 --> 27:36.750
and my head cracked open.

27:36.834 --> 27:38.542
I got caught up.

27:38.625 --> 27:41.667
Suicide, it seemed
romantic, I guess.

27:41.750 --> 27:45.000
So you backed outta
the plan and Trevor didn't.

27:45.083 --> 27:47.208
- Not exactly.
- That's what happened.

27:47.291 --> 27:50.041
Trevor was committed
to it, I wasn't.

27:50.125 --> 27:51.208
What do you mean, Raquel?

27:51.291 --> 27:52.375
I should say first

27:52.458 --> 27:54.041
I'm not guilty of anything.

27:54.125 --> 27:55.166
Mm-hmm.

27:55.250 --> 27:57.000
The suicide pact
was in the
winter.

27:57.083 --> 27:58.375
By the time spring came

27:58.458 --> 28:01.583
Trevor had met Dawn,
and the plan changed.

28:01.667 --> 28:02.542
Keep goin'.

28:02.625 --> 28:05.041
The lovebirds made a pact.

28:05.125 --> 28:07.333
- Brought us in on it.
- What kind of pact?

28:07.417 --> 28:11.250
Wasn't to kill
ourselves.
It was to kill him.

28:14.834 --> 28:17.709
- I feel sick.
- Me, too.

28:17.792 --> 28:19.000
(Trevor)
Yeah, me, too.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.375
It's okay, baby.

28:27.458 --> 28:29.125
He's gonna be gone.

28:29.208 --> 28:32.083
After tonight, your
stepfather's gonna be
gone.

28:32.166 --> 28:33.375
What if he grabs the gun?

28:33.458 --> 28:37.000
First thing I do
when I go in there..

28:37.083 --> 28:38.667
...is point it at his face

28:38.750 --> 28:40.125
'and tell him
this is what happens'

28:40.208 --> 28:41.959
when you're not
worthy of life.

28:42.041 --> 28:43.625
Here. Gloves.

28:43.709 --> 28:46.458
You guys, you don't
have to do this.

28:46.542 --> 28:47.875
All I have is just one more year

28:47.959 --> 28:49.792
and if I can just
make it to college--

28:49.875 --> 28:52.291
Yeah, where he'll
visit you, Dawn.

28:52.375 --> 28:54.583
And it won't stop.

28:54.667 --> 28:55.917
What if something goes wrong?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.583
I wrote a note.

28:57.667 --> 29:00.041
Just in case
something happens to
us.

29:00.125 --> 29:02.166
If your stepfather hurts us or..

29:02.250 --> 29:04.083
...if we get arrested.

29:09.166 --> 29:12.166
"This is TD,
writing from a scary spot.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.750
"I want you to know
that I am in danger.

29:14.834 --> 29:16.792
'"If something
happens to me today'

29:16.875 --> 29:18.667
"please tell
my parents I love them.

29:18.750 --> 29:19.959
'"I want my parents to know'

29:20.041 --> 29:21.583
'"that I don't regret
what I'm doing.'

29:21.667 --> 29:25.250
"It may seem extreme,
but it's best for everyone.

29:26.291 --> 29:27.667
Trevor Dawson."

29:27.750 --> 29:29.458
(Boris)
'You know, with my mom'

29:29.542 --> 29:32.291
yeah, I can drink.

29:32.375 --> 29:34.542
I can toke up in front of her.

29:34.625 --> 29:36.500
But sometimes I feel like

29:36.583 --> 29:39.083
if I were to put
a gun to my head

29:39.166 --> 29:41.083
'she couldn't care
about that either.'

29:41.166 --> 29:42.500
I am willing to take

29:42.583 --> 29:45.125
whatever consequences
there are, Dawn.

29:45.208 --> 29:47.417
Me too, baby.

29:48.417 --> 29:50.041
Let's do our fingerprints.

29:50.125 --> 29:51.375
You're burning them off?

29:51.458 --> 29:52.959
Yeah, maybe we should
just wear gloves, man.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.458
It's what professionals do.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.709
(Raquel)
You guys.

29:56.792 --> 29:58.959
I don't have
my inhaler, you know.

29:59.041 --> 30:02.834
I seriously can't
even breathe right now.

30:02.917 --> 30:04.500
What, you want me
to go to the crime scene

30:04.583 --> 30:06.166
and just pass out?

30:06.250 --> 30:07.667
I can't go.

30:07.750 --> 30:10.166
- Stay with Dawn.
- 'Okay.'

30:10.250 --> 30:11.834
'Cause I just mean,
I really shouldn't go.

30:11.917 --> 30:13.750
Whatever.

30:13.834 --> 30:16.458
It's time.
Trevor.

30:25.750 --> 30:28.041
I love you.

30:49.792 --> 30:52.000
I faked my asthma attack.

30:52.083 --> 30:53.458
I didn't,
like, wanna be

30:53.542 --> 30:56.834
like a dead or on the lam.

30:56.917 --> 30:59.000
I wanted to live.

30:59.083 --> 31:00.291
So that was the note

31:00.375 --> 31:02.500
everyone thought
was Trevor's suicide note?

31:02.583 --> 31:04.709
It was in case something
went wrong with the plan.

31:04.792 --> 31:06.542
So you and Dawn stayed back?

31:06.625 --> 31:10.166
Boris and Trevor took the gun
and went to kill Dawn's
stepdad.

31:10.250 --> 31:12.458
But Philip Hill is alive.

31:12.542 --> 31:15.291
And that was
the last time I saw Trevor.

31:21.792 --> 31:23.250
This kid, Trevor Dawson

31:23.333 --> 31:25.917
was pushed from
the roof of his high school.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.083
(Hill)
I'm not talking to you
without my lawyer.

31:29.166 --> 31:31.417
He was your
stepdaughter's
boyfriend.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.500
You got the wrong kid.

31:33.583 --> 31:35.875
Dawn didn't do
the boyfriend thing.

31:35.959 --> 31:37.709
Focused on academics.

31:37.792 --> 31:41.250
Oh, I'm sure that's why she
didn't do the boyfriend
thing.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.000
I don't know what you mean.

31:43.083 --> 31:44.792
He knew your secret, Phil.

31:44.875 --> 31:47.125
What you were
doing to that girl.

31:47.208 --> 31:48.875
'And now I know.'

31:48.959 --> 31:52.250
Be a lot harder to pick me off.

31:52.333 --> 31:54.333
Lawyer.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.291
What is this?

32:12.375 --> 32:14.709
Dawn wants to know
what happened that night.

32:16.417 --> 32:18.125
What do you know about that?

32:18.208 --> 32:20.583
- Those were my friends.
- 'Come on, Dawn.'

32:20.667 --> 32:22.750
Do you have any idea
what those boys did to me?

32:22.834 --> 32:24.458
What they were
going to do to me?

32:24.542 --> 32:28.291
I gave them the alarm code.

32:28.375 --> 32:31.458
Trevor was at your house
the night he died, Philip.

32:31.542 --> 32:33.542
And you went without a scratch.

32:33.625 --> 32:34.959
Never called the cops, either.

32:35.041 --> 32:37.375
Maybe because whatever
Trevor did to you

32:37.458 --> 32:39.750
it wasn't as bad
as what you did to him.

32:39.834 --> 32:42.166
It was for my family what I did.

32:42.250 --> 32:43.834
How does that work?

32:43.917 --> 32:46.083
Not calling the police..

32:46.166 --> 32:48.500
...because I didn't want it
to get back to my family

32:48.583 --> 32:50.041
'have their hearts broken.'

32:50.125 --> 32:52.625
The lies those punks
were spewing about us.

32:55.083 --> 32:57.041
You're a parent, man.

32:57.125 --> 32:59.333
You're somebody's dad.

32:59.417 --> 33:01.834
You're supposed to
love them and protect them

33:01.917 --> 33:04.417
and give a crap
if they live or die

33:04.500 --> 33:06.959
'or if they're hurting.'

33:07.041 --> 33:10.083
'Your kids didn't
ask to be born.'

33:10.166 --> 33:12.667
'You did it to them.'

33:12.750 --> 33:14.333
You brought 'em here

33:14.417 --> 33:17.291
'and now you don't
care how they feel.'

33:17.375 --> 33:19.166
'You ignore them.'

33:19.250 --> 33:20.500
'You rape them.'

33:20.583 --> 33:22.792
They need you, man.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.709
'You're supposed to care.'

33:24.792 --> 33:26.709
And you don't.

33:26.792 --> 33:27.875
Stop it, man, stop.

33:27.959 --> 33:30.375
Stop, please.

33:30.458 --> 33:32.041
I don't wanna do this.

33:32.125 --> 33:33.625
Get away from me.

33:33.709 --> 33:35.041
I'm doing it.

33:36.959 --> 33:38.166
Look, I love your stepdaughter

33:38.250 --> 33:40.875
more than anything
in the whole world.

33:40.959 --> 33:43.125
And that's why
I'm taking her away from you.

33:43.208 --> 33:45.542
Because that's what you do
for someone you love.

33:45.625 --> 33:47.208
You protect them from pain.

33:49.458 --> 33:50.375
Can't do this, man.

33:50.458 --> 33:52.041
It's messed up.

33:52.125 --> 33:53.583
Let's go.

34:02.333 --> 34:03.709
Not cool, man.

34:07.834 --> 34:10.250
That kid was a maniac, Dawn.

34:10.333 --> 34:11.792
And you did the right thing.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.917
And stayed with me.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.208
'Because we're family.'

34:16.291 --> 34:18.583
You sure you didn't
find those kids

34:18.667 --> 34:20.750
at the high school
later, Philip?

34:20.834 --> 34:23.041
I was tied up till
the housekeeper came.

34:23.125 --> 34:25.208
(Jeffries)
'Dawn, you didn't see the
boys'

34:25.291 --> 34:27.667
after they come back
from your house?

34:27.750 --> 34:28.750
Boris.

34:28.834 --> 34:31.166
He said Trevor had jumped.

34:31.250 --> 34:33.625
So, Boris was the last to see?

34:39.625 --> 34:41.750
I want you to know,
I don't blame you, Dawn

34:41.834 --> 34:44.500
for telling
those boys what you did.

34:44.583 --> 34:45.792
You were young.

34:47.208 --> 34:50.291
And you took that away from me.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.709
Goodbye, Philip.

35:03.458 --> 35:06.542
Don't think you can walk out
of here and relax, Phil.

35:06.625 --> 35:08.083
'You'll see me again.'

35:10.000 --> 35:12.166
I promise.

35:22.417 --> 35:23.917
We didn't hurt Philip Hill.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.500
I don't care
about that guy,
Boris.

35:25.583 --> 35:28.125
We want to know what happened
between you and Trevor

35:28.208 --> 35:31.083
after he didn't
let you kill Philip.

35:31.166 --> 35:32.125
Even though we backed out

35:32.208 --> 35:34.125
I think it messed with his head

35:34.208 --> 35:35.250
how close we came.

35:35.333 --> 35:39.166
Why do you think that?

35:39.250 --> 35:41.291
He got all quiet.

35:41.375 --> 35:43.458
Thinking about his own parents.

35:44.583 --> 35:45.792
Rage he had about them.

35:45.875 --> 35:49.041
But that was you.

35:49.125 --> 35:51.417
You're talking about you.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.166
I mean, you're the one
whose mother wouldn't
care

35:53.250 --> 35:54.875
if you put a gun to your head.

35:54.959 --> 35:56.834
Trevor was gonna
go off with Dawn.

35:56.917 --> 35:59.166
I mean, he had plans.
His parents cared.

35:59.250 --> 36:00.834
(Rush)
'But you had no one.'

36:00.917 --> 36:03.166
And the only plan
you had was a suicide pact

36:03.250 --> 36:04.458
with a kid
who was gonna leave you

36:04.542 --> 36:08.333
because he'd found
a way to be happy.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.875
Which I never did, FYI.

36:10.959 --> 36:13.125
Trevor said,
"Hang in there.

36:13.208 --> 36:15.375
You'll find a way."

36:15.458 --> 36:16.709
But I can't.

36:19.458 --> 36:21.542
It should have been me.

36:21.625 --> 36:23.750
Who died up there.

36:23.834 --> 36:25.959
'Is that what you thought?'

36:27.166 --> 36:29.250
That's the truth.

36:30.709 --> 36:32.417
It was supposed to be me.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.333
(Trevor)
'Hey, Boris.'

36:34.417 --> 36:36.083
Hey, Boris, stop, man.

36:36.166 --> 36:38.125
We got to go back to the pact.

36:38.208 --> 36:41.041
This is so screwed up.

36:41.125 --> 36:43.542
We didn't do anything, man.

36:43.625 --> 36:45.208
We have nothing to run from.

36:45.291 --> 36:46.792
I got to get out.

36:46.875 --> 36:48.417
'I got to get out of my life.'

36:48.500 --> 36:50.542
You know what I mean.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.375
Yeah, but I'm over that.

36:52.458 --> 36:54.583
I don't wanna be,
like some screwed-up guy

36:54.667 --> 36:56.959
with, like, death
everywhere, you know?

36:57.041 --> 36:58.917
I thought you were depressed.

37:07.834 --> 37:10.250
I wanna go get in my car
right now with Dawn, man

37:10.333 --> 37:11.709
and-and I want to hold her

37:11.792 --> 37:13.750
and I wanna talk
to her all night.

37:13.834 --> 37:15.834
'And I know
you think that's gay.'

37:15.917 --> 37:18.500
But I just wanna be here..

37:18.583 --> 37:20.083
...you know?

37:20.166 --> 37:22.750
I just want to, like

37:22.834 --> 37:26.166
I don't know, love somebody.

37:26.250 --> 37:27.458
'I want things, man.'

37:29.125 --> 37:30.875
Like life things.

37:33.750 --> 37:35.458
If I jumped off
this roof right now

37:35.542 --> 37:37.125
and I was laying dead down there

37:37.208 --> 37:40.625
with blood all over me

37:40.709 --> 37:42.709
man, I'd think about my mom.

37:42.792 --> 37:45.000
- She wouldn't care.
- Don't say that.

37:45.083 --> 37:47.667
She wouldn't.

37:47.750 --> 37:48.792
She hates me, man.

37:48.875 --> 37:50.917
Well, then she's a bitch, man.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.750
Because you're a good guy.

37:53.834 --> 37:56.375
- I'm such a screw-up.
- No, you're not.

37:56.458 --> 37:59.458
You're smart.
You got to endure, man.

37:59.542 --> 38:01.500
- No.
- You got to hang in there.

38:01.583 --> 38:04.250
- Nobody wants me around, man.
- That's not true, man.

38:04.333 --> 38:07.959
I know what you're thinking,
but it's not the case.

38:08.041 --> 38:10.375
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

38:10.458 --> 38:11.834
Hey, stop, man.
What are you...?

38:11.917 --> 38:14.083
- Trevor, just let me.
- Stop.
