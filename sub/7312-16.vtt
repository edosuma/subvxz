00:05.614 --> 00:07.485
â™ª

00:13.926 --> 00:15.493
Oh, oh.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.756
Oh, sorry. Sorry.Watch where you're
going, man.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.020
Everybody's got an angle, huh?

00:27.070 --> 00:29.116
MAN:
Get your dogs
right here. Who's next?

00:29.159 --> 00:31.031
MAN 2: I'll take two kraut dogs,
one with mustard.

00:31.074 --> 00:34.773
Excuse me. Just need a napkin.
Thank you.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.004
Not exactly your style.

00:48.048 --> 00:51.442
It-- it's a gift
for my mom.

00:51.486 --> 00:52.835
Mind if I take
a look inside?

00:52.878 --> 00:54.750
Yes.

00:54.793 --> 00:56.056
It wasn't a request.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.451
Come on, man, this
is harassment.

01:00.495 --> 01:01.757
That's my purse.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.193
What the hell?!

01:03.237 --> 01:04.716
Hands up where I can see them!

01:04.760 --> 01:06.414
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

01:06.457 --> 01:08.503
Whoa, that's not my purse!

01:45.061 --> 01:47.107
Uh, boss,
I wouldn't do that.

01:47.150 --> 01:49.326
I just finished
calibrating your...

01:49.370 --> 01:51.807
monitors.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.243
It was working fine
until you touched it.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.810
Hmm.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.768
All I did was tweak
the color gamma.

01:56.812 --> 01:57.900
Mind if I...?

01:57.943 --> 02:00.859
Thanks.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.644
Probably just need
to restart

02:02.687 --> 02:04.602
your e-mail client.

02:06.343 --> 02:07.170
No.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.867
All right. Let me try this.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.526
Boss, that's-that's really
not going to help.

02:15.570 --> 02:16.484
Well, it helps me.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.835
Oh! Uh...

02:19.878 --> 02:20.836
Aw, I'm...

02:20.879 --> 02:22.838
Ah, sorry, boss, sorry.

02:24.796 --> 02:26.146
Thanks. Thank you.

02:26.189 --> 02:27.103
I'm sorry. Um...

02:29.584 --> 02:31.847
How about, uh-- how
about you take mine?

02:31.890 --> 02:33.675
It's-It's a
double half-caf

02:33.718 --> 02:35.416
Sumatra blend with a...
with a twist of lemon.

02:37.679 --> 02:40.421
I'll have it fixed
by the time you get back.

02:40.464 --> 02:41.248
TONY:
Morning, boss.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.814
I like that shirt.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.425
I hope you didn't
break his computer.

02:44.468 --> 02:46.470
He doesn't like that thing
even when it's working.

02:46.514 --> 02:47.558
Should have listened
to my horoscope.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.299
It said I should
stay home today.

02:49.343 --> 02:50.561
[Ziva chuckles]

02:50.605 --> 02:52.259
Your horoscope?

02:52.302 --> 02:53.260
What else did it say?

02:53.303 --> 02:54.391
Avoid new relationships.

02:54.435 --> 02:55.784
Which, after last week,

02:55.827 --> 02:57.133
is probably not
a bad idea either.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.352
[laughing]

02:58.395 --> 02:59.831
What's so funny?

02:59.875 --> 03:02.094
Oh, just that you think
you have a choice.

03:02.138 --> 03:04.358
And that you read
your horoscope.McGEE: Well, just for fun.

03:04.401 --> 03:05.576
But it is interesting.

03:05.620 --> 03:06.838
I have been thinking
about taking a break

03:06.882 --> 03:07.926
from dating for a while.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.537
[laughing]
[laughing]

03:09.580 --> 03:11.582
Okay, now what's so funny?

03:11.626 --> 03:14.455
Same thing.Thanks for the support, Tony.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.674
Thought you were going
for coffee.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.415
Yeah, well, I was.
Grab your gear.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.809
We got a dead Marine--
or at least some of him.

03:20.852 --> 03:22.245
Just give me one second
here, boss.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.115
I almost have this fixed.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.947
Fixed.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.993
Let's go.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.914
McGEE:
We got the same I.D.
Arlington P.D. did.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.350
Corporal Zack Armstrong.

03:40.394 --> 03:41.830
Check 'em all, McGee.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.268
We also need to
I.D. the teeth.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.052
I've already requested
the corporal's dental records.

03:47.096 --> 03:50.665
I can construct a mold
when we get back
to the Navy yard.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.406
Is this all there is?GIBBS: Yep.

03:52.449 --> 03:53.581
Any clue as to where

03:53.624 --> 03:55.365
the rest of him is?No.

03:55.409 --> 03:57.193
DUCKY:
Oh, interesting.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.587
This tooth appears
to have been extracted

03:59.630 --> 04:01.328
with a pair of pliers.

04:01.371 --> 04:04.331
GIBBS:
Victim dead or alive, Duck?Impossible to say.

04:04.374 --> 04:08.030
But all of these
identifying features have
been removed for a reason.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.162
Dead.I'll check with
the county coroner.

04:10.206 --> 04:13.296
See if anything's turned up.The pickpocket told us the
same story he told the cops.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.602
ZIVA:
We pulled prints
from the hot dog cart.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.995
Hopefully, our suspect
is among them.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.562
JIMMY: That's one
cold-blooded killer.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.825
He stops for a hot dog while
getting rid of the evidence.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.958
DUCKY:
Well, it's not uncommon
for killers

04:23.001 --> 04:24.699
to find themselves
unusually hungry

04:24.742 --> 04:25.961
after the act.

04:26.004 --> 04:27.963
It is uncommon, however,

04:28.006 --> 04:30.008
to find them disposing
of the evidenceReally?

04:30.052 --> 04:31.923
in such a stylish bag.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.012
Actually, it's a knockoff.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.840
You can tell by
the stitching here

04:35.884 --> 04:37.581
and how steep the curves
are in the "C's."

04:42.282 --> 04:44.545
It's a long story.TONY: And a good
catch, Gremlin.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.547
Might help us trace
it back to the killer.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.853
ZIVA: Though we need to find
the rest of his victim.McGEE: I think I just did.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.681
County coroner's got a body.

04:50.725 --> 04:52.770
Found it in Glen Oak Preserve,

04:52.814 --> 04:54.511
Not far from here,
tied to a tree.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.600
Missing his fingers and teeth.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.298
It's got to be our guy.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.519
JIMMY:
Good news is, DNA
confirms this is,

05:02.563 --> 05:04.521
in fact, Corporal Armstrong.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.349
GIBBS:
Okay, give me the bad news.

05:06.393 --> 05:09.483
Well, I haven't started
my autopsy yet,

05:09.526 --> 05:11.049
but the previous M.E. had

05:11.093 --> 05:13.704
some information
which I thought relevant.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.576
Her report indicates

05:15.619 --> 05:18.927
that this bullet wound to
the head was postmortem.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.407
Killer making sure he was dead.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.060
Well, the actual

05:22.104 --> 05:24.759
cause of death is
far more interesting.

05:24.802 --> 05:27.762
This is Armstrong's
medical file.

05:27.805 --> 05:30.808
It says right here that he is...

05:30.852 --> 05:32.332
Five-six?

05:32.375 --> 05:36.771
Yes, though I measure him
at just over six feet tall.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.381
Hell of a growth spurt.

05:38.425 --> 05:40.775
X rays indicate

05:40.818 --> 05:42.080
massive dislocations

05:42.124 --> 05:44.344
to virtually every bone
in his body

05:44.387 --> 05:45.954
and synovial

05:45.997 --> 05:47.695
capsule trauma

05:47.738 --> 05:50.654
tells me that these occurred
rather slowly,

05:50.698 --> 05:51.960
and I'm sure
you noticed

05:52.003 --> 05:54.789
the rope burns
to his wrists and ankles.

05:54.832 --> 05:57.879
So he was tied up,
and he was tortured?

05:57.922 --> 06:01.273
Rather violently,
using a method

06:01.317 --> 06:03.450
that was quite popular during
the Spanish Inquisition,

06:03.493 --> 06:05.277
known as the rack.

06:05.321 --> 06:07.454
Our corporal

06:07.497 --> 06:09.369
was stretched to death.

06:15.766 --> 06:19.335
TONY:
Corporal Zack Armstrong, 25,
was a decorated Marine.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.032
McGEE:
He was about to be deployed
to Afghanistan.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.991
Before that, he served
two tours in Iraq.

06:23.034 --> 06:25.123
Which earned him
a Silver Star.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.864
He single-handedly captured
the nine

06:26.908 --> 06:30.302
and ten of clubs in the Iraq
war fugitive deck of cards.

06:30.346 --> 06:31.695
High-profile targets.

06:31.739 --> 06:34.132
With many
just now being sentenced.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.657
Think the corporal's murder
was payback for their capture?

06:36.700 --> 06:37.962
TONY:
Well, he was tied
to a tree

06:38.006 --> 06:39.007
while someone tried
to drive off with his feet.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.661
He certainly pissed off
somebody.

06:40.704 --> 06:42.663
Witnesses say they saw him
arguing with a woman

06:42.706 --> 06:43.925
outside a movie theater

06:43.968 --> 06:44.926
the night
before he was killed,

06:44.969 --> 06:46.841
and they said
she was, uh, pissed.

06:46.884 --> 06:47.842
You get a name?

06:47.885 --> 06:49.104
Not yet.

06:49.147 --> 06:51.193
I could check
ATM cameras in the area.

06:51.236 --> 06:54.544
Not without a
warrant, of course.

06:56.372 --> 06:57.808
Always.
You must be
Agent McGee.

06:57.852 --> 07:00.028
Can I help you with something?

07:00.071 --> 07:01.029
Blake Martin,

07:01.072 --> 07:02.117
Viper Key Security.

07:02.160 --> 07:06.338
I e-mailed you
about my visit.

07:06.382 --> 07:08.340
We've been having
some computer problems today.

07:08.384 --> 07:09.341
Huh,

07:09.385 --> 07:10.691
so are we.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.257
My company handles certain

07:12.301 --> 07:14.477
sensitive security issues
for the Pentagon.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.000
I was assigned
by D.O.D.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.567
to investigate
several breaches

07:17.611 --> 07:18.916
that have emanated
from this office.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.178
McGEE:
Really?

07:20.222 --> 07:22.746
Must be some computer virus
or something.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.356
Or illegal hacking.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.490
You are Agent
McGee, right?

07:27.534 --> 07:30.450
Your director assigned you to
help me with my investigation.

07:32.843 --> 07:35.019
Sure, yeah, sure,
happy to help.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.673
[beeping]

07:36.717 --> 07:37.326
Oh, excuse me.

07:37.369 --> 07:39.241
[typing]

07:41.591 --> 07:44.420
Boss, someone just used
our dead Marine's credit card.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.552
Take Ziva.

07:45.595 --> 07:46.814
Yes, boss.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.642
Uh, sorry, I've gotta...

07:48.685 --> 07:50.644
Of course, I understand.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.254
I'll be here when you get back.

07:55.518 --> 07:58.216
FEMALE VOICE [recorded]:
Welcome to the year 2096,

07:58.260 --> 08:01.829
a year of peace...

08:01.872 --> 08:04.396
So we're looking for a player
named Max Destructo.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.528
Paid for his game

08:05.572 --> 08:07.312
using Corporal
Armstrong's credit card.

08:07.356 --> 08:08.357
Should be out soon.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.098
[shouts]Oh! God.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.493
ANNOUNCER:
Red team eliminated.

08:13.536 --> 08:14.798
That's going to be me when
that Pentagon guy is done

08:14.842 --> 08:16.278
with his investigation.

08:16.321 --> 08:17.975
This is,

08:18.019 --> 08:20.369
um, a very interesting
way to spend money.

08:20.412 --> 08:21.805
Green team eliminated.Hmm.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.546
Blue team: victor.

08:23.590 --> 08:24.547
Do you do this?

08:24.591 --> 08:26.549
No, no, no,

08:26.593 --> 08:28.420
it's too geeky,
even for me.

08:28.464 --> 08:29.770
Hey, McGeeminator,

08:29.813 --> 08:31.380
you ready
for a rematch?

08:31.423 --> 08:36.559
Hey, uh, no, actually,
I'm, I'm here working.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.343
Sorry.Start time match...

08:38.387 --> 08:41.085
12, 39, 46.[chuckles]

08:41.129 --> 08:43.218
Red team..."McGeeminator"?

08:43.261 --> 08:47.222
All right, maybe I played
once or... twice.

08:47.265 --> 08:50.486
[female voice speaking
indistinctly]

08:50.530 --> 08:51.269
Oh, there's our guy.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.010
Excuse me.
NCIS.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.795
We need to speak with you.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.492
Please turn around, Max.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.234
Maxine,

08:59.277 --> 09:00.714
and I don't have
to talk to you.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.716
Actually,
you do.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.892
Did you use this
man's credit card?

09:04.935 --> 09:06.154
[chuckles]

09:06.197 --> 09:07.851
Oh, my God, he called the cops.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.244
Yeah.

09:09.287 --> 09:10.593
We were dating.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.639
Found out he was screwing
around, so I dumped him

09:12.682 --> 09:14.336
about a week ago.

09:14.379 --> 09:15.642
And stole his credit card?

09:15.685 --> 09:17.339
No, he owed me
money.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.602
I was using the card
to square the debt.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.125
Look, you can have
his stupid card back.

09:21.169 --> 09:22.692
He won't be
needing it.

09:22.736 --> 09:23.563
He's dead.

09:23.606 --> 09:26.261
Murdered,
actually.

09:26.304 --> 09:29.699
ANNOUNCER:
Match start-- three, two, one.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.701
What happened?

09:31.745 --> 09:34.182
Well, that's what we're
trying to figure out.

09:34.225 --> 09:35.836
Care to add anything
to your statement?

09:35.879 --> 09:38.142
[sighs]

09:38.186 --> 09:41.624
Yeah, uh,
there is something else.

09:41.668 --> 09:44.192
He gave me this envelope
when we were dating.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.497
He was weird about it.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.369
What was in it?
I don't know.

09:47.412 --> 09:49.632
He made me promise
not to open it,

09:49.676 --> 09:52.592
you know, unless he didn't come
back from Afghanistan.

09:52.635 --> 09:55.159
I've been holding it hostage
until he paid me back.

09:55.203 --> 09:56.944
It's at my place.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.859
Just give me
a minute.

10:03.124 --> 10:05.082
Hi, Burt.Hey, Max.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.955
Why don't you go?

10:07.998 --> 10:11.741
I'll stay and, uh, finish the
interview with the manager.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.398
How about I stay?

10:16.441 --> 10:19.314
Look, I'm supposed to be
avoiding relationships, and...

10:20.750 --> 10:22.752
She's...
She's...

10:22.796 --> 10:24.754
She's pretty and...She's pretty.

10:27.931 --> 10:28.671
Fine, I'll go with her.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.760
[chuckles]

10:31.935 --> 10:33.894
Got to start somewhere.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.548
Pony up.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.420
McGee is not going to jail
if I can help it.

10:38.463 --> 10:39.551
Oh, McGee's not going
to go to jail, Abbs.

10:41.945 --> 10:44.600
Can you say that
with 100% certainty?

10:52.782 --> 10:54.001
All right, then.

10:54.044 --> 10:55.742
On to the case.

10:55.785 --> 10:58.440
Um, I I.D.'d the bullet
from Armstrong's head.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.442
It doesn't match
any unsolved cases.

11:00.485 --> 11:04.272
But I did get tons
of hits on this.

11:04.315 --> 11:05.839
Palmer was right,
it's a fake.

11:05.882 --> 11:08.624
And I traced it to an online
retailer in Indonesia.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.104
I need their client list.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.541
Well, that's not
really my department,

11:12.584 --> 11:15.065
but for five bucks, I
can see what I can do.

11:19.853 --> 11:22.203
You're a good man.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.814
And for that,

11:24.858 --> 11:27.991
I give you this.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.906
Pogostemon cablin.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.212
Smell.
[sniffs]

11:31.255 --> 11:32.692
Mm, smells like...

11:32.735 --> 11:34.171
Patchouli.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.173
It was used for centuries
as an insecticide

11:36.217 --> 11:39.350
until it burst on the scene
in the '60s as a perfume.

11:39.394 --> 11:41.091
Why are you having me
smell that, Abbs?

11:41.135 --> 11:43.703
Because, Ducky found
traces of this

11:43.746 --> 11:46.140
in the scratch that was
on Armstrong's face.

11:46.183 --> 11:48.882
So whoever he was with when
he was killed was wearing it.

11:48.925 --> 11:51.885
Unfortunately, that
narrows our suspect pool

11:51.928 --> 11:53.843
down to pretty much everyone
that was at Woodstock.

11:56.237 --> 11:59.153
So once I have
the fusion module,

11:59.196 --> 12:00.937
how do I get
into the reactor?

12:00.981 --> 12:03.331
Well, there's a key under
the Dragon Lord's throne.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.941
Ah. See, he kills
me every time.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.377
He eats my tongue.

12:06.421 --> 12:07.639
Mm, well, takes practice.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.554
Here, let me
get your envelope.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.863
You can come in, you know.

12:13.907 --> 12:14.908
I'd prefer not to.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.736
Why?

12:16.779 --> 12:19.347
Because you're supposed to be
avoiding relationships?

12:21.523 --> 12:22.611
You-You heard that?

12:22.654 --> 12:24.744
Yep.

12:24.787 --> 12:27.572
Bit presumptuous,
but you can relax.

12:27.616 --> 12:28.835
You're not really my type.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.797
You really think that has

12:34.841 --> 12:36.059
something to do with
Zack's murder?

12:36.103 --> 12:37.582
Well, if it does, I'll find out.

12:38.975 --> 12:41.456
I mean, we'llfind out.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.198
I mean...

12:45.677 --> 12:47.549
Is that a 12-core?

12:47.592 --> 12:49.333
Sixteen.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.770
With a ten-meg pipe.

12:50.813 --> 12:51.945
I need the faster
response times

12:51.988 --> 12:53.424
for the newer
online games.

12:53.468 --> 12:57.428
There's a lot of people
after my high scores.

12:57.472 --> 12:58.821
Wait a second.

12:58.865 --> 13:02.042
Is Max Destructo
your gaming handle, too?

13:02.085 --> 13:04.087
But it's not just
Max Destructo,

13:04.131 --> 13:05.915
it's Max Destructo 5,
seven 4's?

13:05.959 --> 13:07.134
Nope, just
Max Destructo.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.922
You hold the high score
in virtually every massively

13:12.966 --> 13:14.794
multiplayer online
role-playing game.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.186
Mm.

13:16.230 --> 13:19.015
You single-handedly killed
the entire skank hoard

13:19.059 --> 13:21.104
from Isle of Cardias
in Blood Fun 6.

13:22.279 --> 13:25.413
You're... awesome.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.589
[chuckles]

13:27.632 --> 13:29.112
You know, I lied.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.506
You actually
are my type.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.682
Danger, Will Robinson.

13:33.725 --> 13:34.857
I love that show.

13:34.901 --> 13:35.858
[laughs]

13:35.902 --> 13:37.904
Me, too. Me, too.

13:37.947 --> 13:38.818
Um...

13:41.124 --> 13:43.083
I should go.

13:43.126 --> 13:46.651
[gunfire][Max screams]

13:53.702 --> 13:56.705
[panting]

13:56.748 --> 13:59.577
You should stay.

14:07.803 --> 14:08.935
[camera clicking]

14:10.110 --> 14:11.676
[sighs]

14:11.720 --> 14:13.983
16 cores. What a waste.

14:14.027 --> 14:17.378
So, was the target your
girlfriend or her computer?

14:17.421 --> 14:18.422
She's not my girlfriend.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.076
Well, Tony said
she was very clingy

14:20.120 --> 14:22.513
when they went to
the safe house last night.

14:22.557 --> 14:25.429
That's just a normal
reaction to being shot at.

14:25.473 --> 14:28.737
This shooting's got to be
connected to Corporal
Armstrong's murder.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.173
McGee.

14:30.217 --> 14:33.089
Maybe it has something
to do with his, um,

14:33.133 --> 14:34.743
mystery letter, huh?

14:34.786 --> 14:35.962
Sealed.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.354
Guess we're gonna
have to wait for Abby

14:37.398 --> 14:38.355
to tell us what's inside.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.444
Shooter didn't
police his brass.

14:40.488 --> 14:41.793
I don't think he had time.

14:41.837 --> 14:43.491
Neighbors say anything?

14:43.534 --> 14:45.710
ZIVA: No one saw
the shooting itself.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.408
Did your girlfriend
happen to mention any...

14:47.451 --> 14:49.018
She's not my girlfriend, Ziva.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.237
She's just another victim.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.587
Fine. Did the victim happen

14:52.630 --> 14:54.632
to mention any unusual vehicles

14:54.676 --> 14:56.286
around the area this past week?

14:56.330 --> 14:57.940
She didn't mention it.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.115
Well, several neighbors did.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.725
I have a partial plate.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.075
Run it down.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.425
[stammers]:
Back at NCIS?

15:04.468 --> 15:06.688
Yeah. There a problem, McGee?

15:06.731 --> 15:09.038
No, no, not at all.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.085
[elevator bell dings]

15:31.365 --> 15:34.020
Back already?

15:34.063 --> 15:37.937
Yeah. Just, um, running
a partial plate here.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.982
Oh, on that drive-by shooting?
I heard about that.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.244
Exciting stuff.

15:41.288 --> 15:44.030
Yeah. Really.

15:46.293 --> 15:47.990
How's your work going?

15:48.034 --> 15:50.297
Uh, nothing like yours.

15:50.340 --> 15:53.996
Well, I used to be a sergeant
in force recon,

15:54.040 --> 15:57.086
but now all I do is spend
all my time sitting at a desk,

15:57.130 --> 15:58.696
chasing down ones and zeroes.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.742
Only thing we have in common
is we both put people in jail.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.483
How's that looking?

16:02.526 --> 16:03.658
MARTIN: So far,
I got nothing.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.271
Either this hacker's pretty
good at covering his tracks,

16:08.315 --> 16:11.535
or maybe it's a virus,
like you said.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.885
Either way,
I won't stop until...

16:13.929 --> 16:16.845
Uh, Abby have any luck
with those bullet fragments

16:16.888 --> 16:18.455
we found in Maxine's apartment?

16:18.499 --> 16:19.587
Yeah, she matched them
to the slug she pulled

16:19.630 --> 16:20.588
out of Armstrong's head.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.720
Same shooter.
She also

16:22.764 --> 16:24.635
opened Armstrong's
mystery envelope.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.376
Give you two guesses
as to what was inside.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.335
MARTIN:
Secret blueprints?

16:28.378 --> 16:30.250
Swiss bank account numbers?

16:30.293 --> 16:31.381
Not even close.

16:31.425 --> 16:32.687
Hey, boss.

16:32.730 --> 16:35.168
Armstrong gave his
girlfriend a copy

16:35.211 --> 16:36.299
of his last will and testament.

16:36.343 --> 16:37.561
She's not his girlfriend,
either.

16:37.605 --> 16:38.649
He says he's leaving
over a million bucks

16:38.693 --> 16:40.738
to his mom,

16:40.782 --> 16:42.305
and then five million
to various animal

16:42.349 --> 16:43.741
and children's charities.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.134
Does Armstrong
have money like that?

16:45.178 --> 16:46.831
Not even close.

16:46.875 --> 16:49.747
He does not even have
$5,000 to his name.

16:49.791 --> 16:50.661
That you know of.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.752
Do you guys have
a forensic accountant?

16:54.796 --> 16:56.276
Is there something else
you could be doing?

16:57.755 --> 16:58.974
Actually, boss,

16:59.018 --> 17:00.193
that's a really great angle.

17:01.890 --> 17:02.804
Don't you think?

17:04.588 --> 17:06.416
Can you get us some names?

17:06.460 --> 17:07.896
MARTIN:
Sure.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.593
We use forensic accountants
all the time.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.465
Not having much
luck here, anyway.

17:11.508 --> 17:12.988
[beeping]Hey, you are,

17:13.032 --> 17:15.034
Agent McGee. You just got
a hit on your shooter.

17:15.077 --> 17:19.212
Oh. Great. Name came back
on the partial plate.

17:19.255 --> 17:21.040
Lisa Bock.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.432
Martial arts
instructor.

17:22.476 --> 17:23.955
Recently sentenced

17:23.999 --> 17:25.609
to court-assigned
anger management classes.

17:25.653 --> 17:26.828
Sounds like
killer material to me.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.934
One more deep breath...

17:47.936 --> 17:51.070
...all the way down to
your root chakra.

17:52.549 --> 17:53.942
Welcome to your body.

17:53.985 --> 17:57.902
And, uh, also, welcome
your friendly neighborhood

17:57.946 --> 17:59.687
NCIS agents.

17:59.730 --> 18:02.168
Don't worry, everybody.
We're here to talk to Lisa.

18:02.211 --> 18:03.604
We have a few
questions, Lisa.

18:03.647 --> 18:04.996
Now?!

18:05.040 --> 18:06.998
I mean...

18:07.042 --> 18:09.436
Now?

18:09.479 --> 18:12.787
Uh-huh.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.049
I thought you were
a martial arts instructor.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.572
I was,

18:15.616 --> 18:18.314
but in light of some recent,

18:18.358 --> 18:20.011
uh, legal troubles...

18:20.055 --> 18:22.971
You slashed a
student's tires.

18:23.014 --> 18:26.017
My therapist suggested I
find a new line of work.

18:26.061 --> 18:26.844
I approve.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.021
You know this woman?

18:30.065 --> 18:32.937
You mean "man-stealing
piece of..."

18:32.981 --> 18:34.461
[breathes deeply]

18:34.504 --> 18:35.723
Sorry.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.203
That wasn't nice.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.465
We dated the same guy.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.469
Corporal Zack Armstrong?

18:42.512 --> 18:43.600
Yeah.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.689
I thought he was a nice guy,

18:45.733 --> 18:48.301
until he gave me a fake will.

18:48.344 --> 18:49.606
He told me not to open it

18:49.650 --> 18:51.086
unless he didn't return
from Afghanistan.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.827
How did you know
it was fake?

18:52.870 --> 18:54.045
I found a bunch
of copies when I,

18:54.089 --> 18:55.743
uh, accidentally went
through his desk.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.136
He would give them to
women he was dating

18:57.179 --> 18:59.312
to make them think
that he was loaded.

18:59.355 --> 19:02.358
Cheeseball even kept a case of
fake Chanel purses in his trunk.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.099
That is disgusting.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.405
I was going
to say "genius."

19:05.448 --> 19:07.407
Except for the fact
that he's dead now.
I heard.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.365
Guess he pissed off
the wrong girl.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.628
[chuckles]

19:11.672 --> 19:13.282
What?

19:13.326 --> 19:16.198
Someone left patchouli
on the dead guy's face.

19:16.242 --> 19:17.330
[sniffing]

19:20.202 --> 19:21.203
When we broke up,

19:21.247 --> 19:23.292
I may have, um,

19:23.336 --> 19:25.251
accidentally hit him.

19:25.294 --> 19:26.730
But I didn't kill him.

19:26.774 --> 19:29.298
And her?

19:29.342 --> 19:31.474
Someone made an attempt
on her life last night.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.433
Last night,
I was teaching a class.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.130
The same thing the night
that Zack was killed.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.784
You want some advice?

19:36.827 --> 19:39.613
Zack was on every
dating site there is.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.963
See who else he's
been screwing over.

19:42.006 --> 19:45.532
There's a lot of really
unstable women out there.

19:51.320 --> 19:54.584
Abbs. Hey, you busy?

19:54.628 --> 19:57.239
I'm just processing
Armstrong's computer.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.632
Mind if I use your spare?

19:58.675 --> 19:59.850
I'm trying to keep
a low profile.

19:59.894 --> 20:00.895
Don't you worry, McGee.

20:00.938 --> 20:03.289
We have got your back.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.682
Oh, let's hope it
doesn't come to that.

20:05.726 --> 20:08.685
So what are you
looking for?

20:08.729 --> 20:09.860
Got a lead on the shooter.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.514
Women Armstrong
has been dating.

20:11.558 --> 20:12.733
And there's a lot.

20:12.776 --> 20:13.821
Going to have
to interview them all.

20:13.864 --> 20:16.171
Well, maybe you'll
meet someone.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.608
Though I heard
you already have.

20:18.652 --> 20:19.870
What?

20:19.914 --> 20:21.959
Wait? What? No.
Who-Who told you that?

20:22.003 --> 20:23.570
I mean, if you have,
it's okay.

20:23.613 --> 20:24.745
But I haven't.

20:24.788 --> 20:26.268
Well, that's not what I hear.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.791
Which would be fine with me.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.706
I mean, why wouldn't it be?

20:29.750 --> 20:30.794
You tell me.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.100
Nothing to tell.

20:32.143 --> 20:33.319
Okay, then.

20:33.362 --> 20:35.364
Okay, then.

20:36.713 --> 20:37.975
Hmm.

20:38.019 --> 20:40.456
Oh, what you got?

20:40.500 --> 20:44.286
There's some sort of bug
on Armstrong's computer.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.374
Oh, I see it.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.115
It's an
eavesdropping program

20:47.158 --> 20:48.595
remotely installed
over the Internet.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.466
Got a time stamp?

20:52.381 --> 20:53.861
Was installed
two days ago

20:53.904 --> 20:56.124
at 10:31 p.m.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.039
According to Ducky, that's right
before Armstrong was killed.

20:58.082 --> 20:59.301
That's got
to be a connection.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.261
Okay, this is weird.

21:02.304 --> 21:05.307
The bug is only
monitoring game ports,

21:05.351 --> 21:07.788
but Armstrong doesn't have
any games on his computer.

21:07.831 --> 21:09.311
There's nothing to monitor.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.705
Maybe they weren't after him.

21:13.663 --> 21:15.186
Yeah, I play video games.

21:15.230 --> 21:16.187
What's the big deal?

21:16.231 --> 21:17.928
You buy any using

21:17.972 --> 21:19.408
Corporal Armstrong's
credit card?

21:19.452 --> 21:23.325
Um, I may have used the card

21:23.369 --> 21:24.805
to pay for the last few weeks

21:24.848 --> 21:26.502
of my subscription
to Fear Tower 3.

21:26.546 --> 21:29.723
I mean, like I said,
he owed me money.

21:29.766 --> 21:32.291
Does this have something
to do with his murder?

21:32.334 --> 21:34.510
Someone was bugging
the game ports

21:34.554 --> 21:36.382
on Corporal Armstrong's
computer.

21:36.425 --> 21:37.470
But he didn't play games.

21:37.513 --> 21:38.384
It wasn't his thing.

21:38.427 --> 21:40.473
Yeah, we know that.

21:40.516 --> 21:43.258
You think someone
was trying to bug me?

21:43.302 --> 21:46.174
And because I used Zack's Visa,

21:46.217 --> 21:48.568
the trace led back
to him instead?

21:48.611 --> 21:50.265
I know it sounds
kind of crazy...
No.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.659
Actually, it doesn't.

21:54.225 --> 21:56.837
Two days ago,
I was at home,

21:56.880 --> 21:59.579
playing Fear Tower on my laptop,
having a kick-ass game.

21:59.622 --> 22:01.842
Broke my all-time points
record. And then...

22:01.885 --> 22:03.017
I hit a kill screen.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.627
Ouch. That hurts.

22:04.671 --> 22:06.368
Kill screen?

22:06.412 --> 22:09.545
It's kind of like a
Y2K bug for video games.

22:09.589 --> 22:11.982
Sometimes, if a player
gets too high a score,

22:12.026 --> 22:14.681
game can't handle it,
and it crashes.

22:14.724 --> 22:16.944
The last screen you see
is called a kill screen.

22:16.987 --> 22:18.641
MAXINE: This was one of the
weirdest I've ever seen.

22:18.685 --> 22:19.729
Weird how?

22:19.773 --> 22:21.427
Almost looked like

22:21.470 --> 22:23.211
some sort of
encrypted data.

22:23.254 --> 22:24.821
I got a ton

22:24.865 --> 22:27.389
of screen grabs
I can show you.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.217
When was this?

22:29.260 --> 22:30.349
10:30 p.m.

22:30.392 --> 22:31.611
On the dot.

22:31.654 --> 22:33.003
Boss, less than
one minute later

22:33.047 --> 22:34.048
someone bugged
Armstrong's computer.

22:37.094 --> 22:39.096
So...

22:39.140 --> 22:42.709
Armstrong is dead because
she won... a video game?

22:52.675 --> 22:55.069
GIBBS:
So, this is Fear Tower 3.

22:55.112 --> 22:57.724
McGEE:
Yeah, and these are screen grabs
from Maxine's last game.

22:57.767 --> 23:00.074
It's not exactly
Pong, huh?

23:00.117 --> 23:01.423
Pong?

23:01.467 --> 23:04.470
Well, the important
point is,

23:04.513 --> 23:07.821
at 10:30 p.m., Maxine
got such a high score
the game crashed,

23:07.864 --> 23:10.389
dumping her into
a kill screen.

23:10.432 --> 23:11.520
Now, this isn't exactly

23:11.564 --> 23:13.392
your grandfather's kill screen.

23:13.435 --> 23:16.569
Exposed some kind of
encrypted data hidden
in the game.

23:16.612 --> 23:17.787
Killer thought
Corporal Armstrong

23:17.831 --> 23:19.180
was doing the exposing.

23:19.223 --> 23:21.225
Yep, and then somehow
figured out his mistake

23:21.269 --> 23:22.531
and went after Maxine.

23:22.575 --> 23:23.880
So, what's it say?

23:23.924 --> 23:25.882
Abby's working on it.

23:25.926 --> 23:27.318
But the more pressing
question is...

23:27.362 --> 23:30.278
How did the data get in the game
in the first place?

23:30.321 --> 23:32.106
And I have the answers.

23:32.149 --> 23:33.934
Where's Martin?

23:33.977 --> 23:36.458
Uh, picking up Gibbs'
forensic accountant.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.373
Thanks again
for that, boss.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.028
I spoke to the CEO

23:41.071 --> 23:44.684
at L9 Games, the company
that makes Fear Tower 3.

23:44.727 --> 23:45.902
They have quite
a facility.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.556
I mean, like, pool tables

23:47.600 --> 23:48.992
and saunas and, uh...

23:50.429 --> 23:53.519
...and employees who are
very focused on their work,

23:53.562 --> 23:55.216
like this man,
Reed Snyder.

23:55.259 --> 23:56.522
The CEO said

23:56.565 --> 23:59.046
he was the lead programmer
for Fear Tower 3.

23:59.089 --> 24:01.352
If there was anything
hidden in the game code,

24:01.396 --> 24:03.485
Snyder would know
about it.
Bring him in.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.095
He disappeared.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.923
Two days ago.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.098
Bank statements.

24:09.622 --> 24:10.884
I got the BOLO.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.581
We'll alert local
airports and bus stations.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.496
Okay, got something here, boss.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.280
Several large wire transfers

24:16.324 --> 24:17.586
to Snyder's bank account.

24:17.630 --> 24:19.458
[snaps fingers]

24:19.501 --> 24:21.024
You recognize something?

24:21.068 --> 24:22.591
Yeah, I do.

24:25.681 --> 24:27.553
Agah Bayar.

24:27.596 --> 24:29.511
Why is a video game designer

24:29.555 --> 24:31.905
getting money
from an arms dealer?

24:31.948 --> 24:34.429
MAN:
You must be Agent Gibbs.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.431
It's an honor
to finally meet you.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.346
May I call you Jethro?

24:42.089 --> 24:44.091
Agent Gibbs it is, then.

24:44.134 --> 24:45.614
You know him?
No.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.924
You wired him a hundred
thousand dollars.

24:52.708 --> 24:55.058
Now you mentioned it, yes,

24:55.102 --> 24:57.191
we do have some
business together.

24:57.234 --> 25:00.194
You're an arms dealer,
and he makes video games--

25:00.237 --> 25:02.109
what kind of business?

25:02.152 --> 25:04.938
I commissioned him to, uh,

25:04.981 --> 25:07.288
to create a video game

25:07.331 --> 25:09.856
to showcase some
of my more, uh...

25:09.899 --> 25:12.032
exotic merchandise.

25:12.075 --> 25:14.208
Totally legitimate,
wouldn't you say...

25:14.251 --> 25:16.515
Agent Gibbs?
Mm-hmm.

25:16.558 --> 25:17.864
You see, I like games.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.561
Yes, I can see that.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.128
Are we done?

25:21.171 --> 25:24.218
No. Sit down.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.046
[exhales]

25:26.089 --> 25:29.136
I must say, you're
much more imposing in person

25:29.179 --> 25:30.964
than your dossier
leads one to believe.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.533
And a lot grayer.

25:35.795 --> 25:37.753
Do you know where he is?

25:39.799 --> 25:41.278
No, I don't.

25:41.322 --> 25:43.324
And it seems like
you don't, either.

25:43.367 --> 25:44.455
Been missing for two days.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.852
You should keep better tabs
on your investment.

25:49.896 --> 25:52.420
A hundred G's is a lot of money.Forgive me...

25:52.463 --> 25:56.555
if I don't take business advice
from a government employee.

26:05.694 --> 26:07.653
Where did you get those?

26:07.696 --> 26:08.915
Government employee.

26:10.090 --> 26:11.482
Look familiar?

26:11.526 --> 26:13.006
No.

26:13.049 --> 26:16.052
But if you give me a copy,
I can help you decipher it.

26:16.096 --> 26:17.880
I only need one thing from you.

26:17.924 --> 26:19.055
Shoot.

26:19.099 --> 26:20.666
As they say.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.450
Where were you two days ago?

26:22.493 --> 26:24.626
I was in Vera Cruz.

26:24.670 --> 26:28.064
A guest of the governor.

26:28.108 --> 26:31.546
Am I correct to assume
that means we're done here?

26:36.595 --> 26:38.509
State Department
confirms it, boss--

26:38.553 --> 26:40.120
his whole entourage
was in Vera Cruz

26:40.163 --> 26:41.512
for two weeks--
must be nice.

26:41.556 --> 26:43.036
It isnice.

26:43.079 --> 26:45.604
Still no word
on Snyder's whereabouts.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.388
McGEE:
But we found some
interesting stuff
in his background

26:47.431 --> 26:49.085
that may explain Bayar's
interest in him.

26:49.129 --> 26:49.999
Define "interesting."

26:50.043 --> 26:51.784
ZIVA:
Reed Snyder,

26:51.827 --> 26:53.350
age 29, he was born

26:53.394 --> 26:55.875
on a small farm in Idaho,
home-schooled by his parents.

26:55.918 --> 26:57.703
Until he ran away
to the big city,

26:57.746 --> 26:59.356
where he taught himself
how to do

26:59.400 --> 27:01.794
whatever the voodoo
is you do, McGee.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.883
Worked as a computer programmer.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.188
TONY:
D.O.D.'s had their eye

27:05.232 --> 27:06.929
on Snyder for a while.ZIVA: He's suspected

27:06.973 --> 27:08.975
of hacking the Pentagon and
selling classified information.

27:09.018 --> 27:10.759
Hacking the Pentagon!

27:10.803 --> 27:13.893
They should lock him up
and throw away the key.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.634
Why haven't they?

27:15.677 --> 27:17.418
Crossword puzzles.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.463
Yep.

27:19.507 --> 27:21.683
We don't really
understand it, either.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.076
Look, it's simple.

27:24.512 --> 27:25.861
During World War II,

27:25.905 --> 27:28.864
the Allies hid secret codes
in crossword puzzles.

27:28.908 --> 27:30.126
Now, to thousands
of regular readers

27:30.170 --> 27:31.954
it would've looked just
like another puzzle.

27:31.998 --> 27:34.174
But if you had the
decryption key...

27:34.217 --> 27:36.176
You could read the secret code.D.O.D.

27:36.219 --> 27:38.134
thinks Snyder's been
putting encrypted secrets

27:38.178 --> 27:39.701
in video games,

27:39.745 --> 27:41.877
which then are
mass-distributed.Okay, all right,

27:41.921 --> 27:43.487
I get it now,
McSmarty Pants,

27:43.531 --> 27:44.924
when he puts it like that.

27:44.967 --> 27:46.490
He didn't say it
like that before.

27:46.534 --> 27:48.014
I get it--
all Snyder has to do

27:48.057 --> 27:50.190
is sell the harmless
decryption key,

27:50.233 --> 27:52.279
and then the buyers can access
the data themselves, right?

27:52.322 --> 27:53.280
Buyers like Agah Bayar.

27:53.323 --> 27:54.281
Right.

27:54.324 --> 27:56.718
So, what's inside Fear Tower 3

27:56.762 --> 27:58.720
that... would interest
an arms dealer?

27:58.764 --> 28:01.114
McGEE:
You name it.

28:01.157 --> 28:03.725
Data on arms shipments,
satellite codes...

28:03.769 --> 28:06.728
Whatever it is,
hitting the kill screen
accidentally exposed it.

28:06.772 --> 28:09.383
And Snyder killed
to keep it a secret.

28:11.559 --> 28:13.343
What is he doing now?

28:13.387 --> 28:15.432
I'm not sure I follow.

28:15.476 --> 28:17.173
You kill the zombie...

28:17.217 --> 28:19.175
And then you kill
their brains.

28:19.219 --> 28:21.351
Wouldn't hypovolemic shock

28:21.395 --> 28:24.006
render the second step
unnecessary?No, no, no. No.

28:24.050 --> 28:26.139
'Cause when you shoot
a zombie in the head,

28:26.182 --> 28:28.141
sometimes the brains
sneak out through the hole,

28:28.184 --> 28:30.056
and then you have
to kill that separately.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.102
I see. I think.Mm-hmm.

28:33.146 --> 28:34.495
Or maybe
I'd rather not.

28:34.538 --> 28:35.931
GIBBS: Well, I'd
rather you did.

28:35.975 --> 28:37.106
I need some
answers.

28:37.150 --> 28:39.152
Well, I've been going
over the evidence

28:39.195 --> 28:41.981
from Mr. Snyder's house,
hoping to find some clue

28:42.024 --> 28:44.157
to his current whereabouts.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.028
Okay, what do you got?Well, on the outside,

28:46.072 --> 28:48.030
a normal, productive individual,

28:48.074 --> 28:49.815
but on the inside...Bad things.

28:49.858 --> 28:50.816
[chuckles]

28:55.037 --> 28:57.474
I'm sure Dr. Mallard
will elaborate for us.

28:58.867 --> 29:02.044
Mr. Snyder is
a very disturbed individual,

29:02.088 --> 29:04.786
his choice of game design
notwithstanding.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.788
Take this, his diary,

29:06.832 --> 29:08.659
or manifesto.

29:08.703 --> 29:10.836
It's a rambling call
for revolution

29:10.879 --> 29:13.012
against "modern society's

29:13.055 --> 29:15.449
technological
industrial systems."

29:15.492 --> 29:17.016
Our computer guy?Yeah.

29:17.059 --> 29:19.409
Who seems to favor
old-fashioned board games

29:19.453 --> 29:21.020
in his personal life.

29:21.063 --> 29:22.935
Like this one,
from World War II.

29:22.978 --> 29:24.414
Fingerprint analysis

29:24.458 --> 29:26.808
shows that he preferred to
play for the Axis powers.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.332
Oh, yeah, this man
had no love of country.

29:29.376 --> 29:30.638
And he appears

29:30.681 --> 29:32.727
to be removing himself from it.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.685
I found all this
stuff in the trash.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.949
He hadn't packed
anything,

29:36.992 --> 29:39.821
but I can't escape the feeling
that he is going someplace.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.170
ZIVA:
Perhaps because he is.

29:41.214 --> 29:42.955
With the help

29:42.998 --> 29:45.131
of Martin's forensic accountant,
we were able to trace some

29:45.174 --> 29:47.263
of the money Snyder received
from his wire transfers.

29:47.307 --> 29:50.571
He purchased a
home recently.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.312
In Morocco.

29:52.355 --> 29:54.705
Interesting.Well, you guys
got to find him

29:54.749 --> 29:56.011
before he gets there.

29:56.055 --> 29:56.969
We may already have.

29:58.535 --> 30:00.276
The BOLO came back on his car.

30:02.148 --> 30:03.279
[creaking, clanging]

30:06.717 --> 30:09.677
TONY:
So, when I said, "quietly"?

30:09.720 --> 30:13.202
McGEE: Door was rusted
shut, all right?

30:13.246 --> 30:15.509
Snyder could be anywhere.

30:21.863 --> 30:25.562
Wow, abandoned power
plants are creepy.

30:25.606 --> 30:27.086
McGEE: It's not
a power plant,

30:27.129 --> 30:29.305
it's a pump
storage facility.

30:29.349 --> 30:31.481
It stores energy in
the form of...What?

30:31.525 --> 30:33.222
You talking to me?

30:33.266 --> 30:34.876
Not anymore.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.226
So, when this is over,
are you gonna ask

30:37.270 --> 30:39.838
that Maxine girl out
on a date, or what?

30:39.881 --> 30:41.100
Nope.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.493
You still hiding
behind your horoscope?

30:43.537 --> 30:46.148
Who said I was hiding?

30:46.192 --> 30:49.543
The guy who's been
working with you for
the last seven years.

30:49.586 --> 30:52.720
[chuckles] I think I'd
like sarcasticTony
back now, please.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.809
Oh. He's not
here right now.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.029
Just wise,
insightful Tony.

30:57.072 --> 30:59.074
And, uh, he thinks you've
got more on your mind

30:59.118 --> 31:00.684
than just a horoscope.

31:00.728 --> 31:03.992
But there's taking it easy,
and then there's, uh...

31:04.036 --> 31:07.213
being a dumb-ass,
which is kind of
my strong suit.

31:07.256 --> 31:11.086
But you like this girl;
she seems to like you--

31:11.130 --> 31:13.567
what more do you
need to know?

31:13.610 --> 31:15.525
I'll think about it.

31:15.569 --> 31:17.527
Don't think too long;
life's short.

31:17.571 --> 31:19.355
Just ask this guy.

31:19.399 --> 31:24.099
Boss... we found
our missing programmer.

31:33.543 --> 31:36.416
DUCKY:
Abdominal distension
suggested that time of death

31:36.459 --> 31:39.201
was roughly three days ago.

31:39.245 --> 31:41.682
However, this...

31:41.725 --> 31:43.553
yeah, well, this...

31:43.597 --> 31:45.425
slightly increases

31:45.468 --> 31:46.948
the estimate.

31:46.992 --> 31:49.646
A mature rove beetle.

31:49.690 --> 31:52.562
They don't appear until
at least the fourth day.

31:52.606 --> 31:55.870
He was already dead
when Corporal Armstrong

31:55.914 --> 31:58.742
was murdered.Yes, which rules him
out as your killer--

31:58.786 --> 32:00.962
a killer that's
been quite busy.

32:01.006 --> 32:04.835
Both he and Armstrong
have identical mutilations.

32:04.879 --> 32:07.882
I believe the same person
is responsible for both.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.798
Armstrong was a mistake;
this guy wasn't.

32:10.841 --> 32:13.670
Espionage is
a dangerous game.

32:13.714 --> 32:15.411
If you want
to find out why

32:15.455 --> 32:17.065
this man is dead,
perhaps you need

32:17.109 --> 32:18.849
to find out what he was selling.

32:18.893 --> 32:20.242
ABBY:
Found it.

32:20.286 --> 32:23.289
And you are not
going to like it.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.726
GIBBS:
What am I looking at?

32:25.769 --> 32:27.641
ABBY:
It's executable code.

32:27.684 --> 32:30.339
Snyder wasn't selling
secrets that he hacked.

32:30.383 --> 32:32.907
He was selling
his actual hacking program.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.736
It's like a locksmith
selling his lock-picking tools.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.738
And these tools enable the buyer

32:37.781 --> 32:40.262
to gain access to the Pentagon's
most secure mainframe.

32:40.306 --> 32:41.481
Theoretically.

32:41.524 --> 32:43.004
I mean, the good news is

32:43.048 --> 32:44.266
that even with Snyder's
hacking program,

32:44.310 --> 32:45.746
it would take a computer,

32:45.789 --> 32:48.662
like, millions of years to crack
the Pentagon's defenses.

32:48.705 --> 32:51.360
How long would it take
a million computers?

32:51.404 --> 32:53.493
Gibbs, you're a genius.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.974
It's called
"distributive
computing."

32:56.017 --> 33:00.239
If this is downloaded onto
millions of computers, then...

33:00.282 --> 33:01.805
McGEE:
Snyder would have
enough combined

33:01.849 --> 33:04.025
processing power to crack
the Pentagon wide open.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.200
Or Agah Bayar.

33:05.244 --> 33:07.028
Anyone who bought
an unlock code

33:07.072 --> 33:09.291
is going to have access
to top secret information.

33:09.335 --> 33:10.597
This could make WikiLeaks look

33:10.640 --> 33:12.338
like a little, tiny
dripping faucet.

33:12.381 --> 33:14.470
You have to call the
Pentagon, Gibbs, now.Yeah, got it. Thanks.

33:18.648 --> 33:20.737
What?

33:20.781 --> 33:23.479
I think there's already
someone there that knows.

33:26.787 --> 33:29.746
Took the liberty of
accessing your security logs.

33:29.790 --> 33:32.619
You knew about the hacks coming
out of NCIS a long time ago,

33:32.662 --> 33:33.968
but you never reported it.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.535
I'm here now, aren't I?
GIBBS:
Yeah.

33:35.578 --> 33:37.232
We noticed.

33:37.276 --> 33:39.626
Puts you in a perfect position
to keep tabs

33:39.669 --> 33:41.715
on the investigation into
Corporal Armstrong's murder.

33:41.758 --> 33:43.412
Why on earth would I do that?

33:43.456 --> 33:45.023
So you'd know when to run.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.502
Hmm...

33:46.546 --> 33:48.765
You swept the NCIS
hacks under the carpet

33:48.809 --> 33:50.376
because they made you look bad.

33:50.419 --> 33:52.378
But you couldn't ignore
what Snyder was doing.

33:52.421 --> 33:54.815
If the Pentagon knew how badly
they could be hacked...

33:54.858 --> 33:57.513
You'd be looking for a new
billion-dollar contract.

33:57.557 --> 33:58.775
McGEE:
So you tracked
Snyder down,

33:58.819 --> 34:00.560
you chased him into
an old utility plant,

34:00.603 --> 34:01.822
and you killed him.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.917
Have you lost your mind?

34:09.960 --> 34:12.354
Bet you almost did when Maxine
triggered the kill screen.

34:12.398 --> 34:14.313
Looked like another attack.

34:14.356 --> 34:16.619
Which you tracked back
to Armstrong.

34:20.623 --> 34:22.756
Only, he didn't know a thing.

34:22.799 --> 34:25.063
McGEE:
Even after you nearly
tore off his arms

34:25.106 --> 34:27.065
and legs
in an enhanced interrogation.

34:30.416 --> 34:32.374
Um, uh, I got to tell you.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.333
That-That's...
It's a great story.

34:34.376 --> 34:36.204
You know, it'd be even better

34:36.248 --> 34:37.858
if you had any evidence.

34:37.901 --> 34:39.599
Yeah, well,
we got your fingerprint

34:39.642 --> 34:41.905
on the hot dog cart.

34:41.949 --> 34:44.386
McGEE:
Next time you may want
to dump the evidence

34:44.430 --> 34:45.692
before you stop for a bite.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.130
You know how many enemies

34:49.174 --> 34:51.872
are trying to destroy
our way of life?

34:51.915 --> 34:53.830
You're doing a pretty good job
of that by yourself.

34:53.874 --> 34:55.963
McGEE:
Pentagon computers
are still at risk.

34:56.006 --> 34:57.617
You killed Snyder
for nothing.

34:57.660 --> 35:00.098
No one could get enough evidence
to nail him.

35:00.141 --> 35:02.535
Yet.
Well, I wasn't
willing to wait.

35:08.193 --> 35:08.976
We got enough, boss.

35:10.151 --> 35:12.371
Enough?

35:14.547 --> 35:16.853
You don't have my fingerprints.

35:16.897 --> 35:18.377
No.

35:18.420 --> 35:19.856
[paper sliding on table]

35:19.900 --> 35:21.554
But we just got your confession.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.776
So all this time,

35:26.820 --> 35:28.430
Martin was eavesdropping
on our conversation.

35:28.474 --> 35:30.171
That's how he learned
about Maxine.

35:30.215 --> 35:32.173
Luckily, she's still alive.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.001
Which means
she's, um...

35:34.044 --> 35:35.220
Sorry. Can't do.

35:35.263 --> 35:36.786
Got a major security hole

35:36.830 --> 35:38.571
at the Pentagon
that needs help plugging.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.355
It might be too late
for that.

35:40.399 --> 35:42.009
Bring Gibbs to my lab now.

35:43.793 --> 35:45.882
Abby.

35:45.926 --> 35:49.799
Snyder built an insurance policy
into his hacking program.

35:49.843 --> 35:51.410
Insurance policy for what?

35:51.453 --> 35:54.717
Well, every week, he needed to
enter a code into the system.

35:54.761 --> 35:56.284
It's like a dead
man's switch.

35:56.328 --> 35:58.330
If he didn't,

35:58.373 --> 36:00.375
then Fear Tower 3
would go Armageddon.
GIBBS:
What does that mean, Abby?

36:00.419 --> 36:02.595
Snyder's hacker program

36:02.638 --> 36:04.466
would disable all Department
of Defense firewalls

36:04.510 --> 36:07.556
and erase...

36:07.600 --> 36:08.514
Erase what?

36:08.557 --> 36:09.428
Erase everything.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.606
Any military computer on the
grid would be wiped clean.

36:13.649 --> 36:15.216
Yeah, it's on, Gibbs.

36:15.260 --> 36:18.001
The program--
it's already launched.

36:19.786 --> 36:21.396
Shut it down.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.181
Gibbs...

36:23.224 --> 36:25.531
Fear Tower 3 is

36:25.574 --> 36:27.576
installed on 15
million computers.

36:27.620 --> 36:29.230
You can't stop them all.

36:29.274 --> 36:31.972
McGEE:
Maybe we don't have to.

36:32.015 --> 36:34.192
Snyder's got
to have a mainframe somewhere

36:34.235 --> 36:35.367
to coordinate the attack,

36:35.410 --> 36:37.456
and I can try
to shut it down from MTAC,

36:37.499 --> 36:39.197
but we also need
to find its physical location

36:39.240 --> 36:40.328
and try shutting it down
directly.

36:40.372 --> 36:42.200
Well, then,

36:42.243 --> 36:44.680
it's a good thing
I already found it.

36:44.724 --> 36:48.945
Snyder did not come here
to hide from Martin.

36:48.989 --> 36:51.165
He was on his way
to his hideout.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.297
We're in.

36:52.340 --> 36:55.125
Where are we going?

36:55.169 --> 36:58.128
I'm accessing the facility map
on Snyder's mainframe.

36:58.172 --> 36:59.521
Mapping your location

36:59.565 --> 37:01.436
and your destination.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.613
Now, there should be a corridor
in front of you.

37:04.657 --> 37:06.485
And move fast.
We've only got three minutes

37:06.528 --> 37:08.574
and 40 seconds left,
and I'm not having any luck

37:08.617 --> 37:10.184
shutting his mainframe
down from here.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.620
There is nothing.

37:11.664 --> 37:13.709

Three minutes,
30 seconds remaining.

37:13.753 --> 37:14.623
Well, not according
to Snyder's map.

37:16.930 --> 37:20.020
Hey, this is hollow.

37:20.063 --> 37:22.022
Find something
to wedge it, Ziva.

37:22.065 --> 37:23.241
We can probably...

37:23.284 --> 37:25.634
Or we could do that.

the security system.

Well, untrip it.

McGee, is there a reset button
you can hit?

37:43.826 --> 37:45.524
Tony, this is not a video game,
okay?

COMPUTER:
Three minutes remaining.

37:47.177 --> 37:49.397
Look, maybe we should just wait
for the bomb squad here.

37:49.441 --> 37:51.617
I mean, it looks like the whole
place is booby trapped.

37:51.660 --> 37:53.575
I got no time, McGee.
Get me through this.

37:58.450 --> 38:00.843

Fifth firewall breached.

38:00.887 --> 38:02.671

Okay, the safest route
should be...

All right, continue straight,
boss, until I say.

38:52.460 --> 38:53.243
Make that right turn.

38:53.287 --> 38:55.637
There you go.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.295
Continue straight.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.297
Something's wrong.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.994
It's too quiet.

39:05.038 --> 39:06.909
All right, boss,
it's a left turn up ahead.

39:06.953 --> 39:09.259
Take that left.
Walk straight

39:09.303 --> 39:12.088
for about 20 yards.

39:12.132 --> 39:12.872
[rapid beeping]

39:12.915 --> 39:14.308
[explosion]

39:14.352 --> 39:16.441
Boss?COMPUTER: One minute,

39:16.484 --> 39:19.182
30 seconds remaining.Boss, are you okay?

39:19.226 --> 39:21.141
Boss...?

39:21.184 --> 39:23.186
Boss, can you hear me? Boss?

39:23.230 --> 39:24.405
[beeping]

39:24.449 --> 39:26.233
COMPUTER:
Third firewall breached.

39:26.276 --> 39:28.235
Can you hear me?

39:28.278 --> 39:31.978
[Gibbs coughing]

39:36.069 --> 39:38.158
Hey, McGee, you missed one.

39:38.201 --> 39:39.942
Sorry about that.

39:39.986 --> 39:43.076
All right.

39:43.119 --> 39:44.425
It'll be coming up soon.
Snyder's mainframe

39:44.469 --> 39:46.122
should be right around
the next corner.

39:46.166 --> 39:47.776
COMPUTER:
One minute remaining.

39:51.258 --> 39:54.000
Getting interference
on the visual.

39:54.043 --> 39:55.480
Wait, boss, that's got to be it.

39:55.523 --> 39:59.440
Man, I hate computers.[beeping]

39:59.484 --> 40:03.313
COMPUTER:
Second firewall breached.

40:10.973 --> 40:13.193
[static crackles]

40:13.236 --> 40:14.977
Boss? Boss, what's happening?

40:15.021 --> 40:16.501
I lost visual.

40:16.544 --> 40:18.416
COMPUTER:
30 seconds remaining.

40:20.548 --> 40:22.463
Boss, are you okay?

40:22.507 --> 40:24.596
What's going on?

40:24.639 --> 40:26.598
GIBBS:
I cut all the power.
It's still going.

40:26.641 --> 40:28.774
Okay, must have an internal
battery backup.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.253
GIBBS:
A what?!

40:30.297 --> 40:33.518
But it could also
be booby trapped.

40:33.561 --> 40:35.911
Boss, now we're gonna have
to shut down the computer

40:35.955 --> 40:37.696
using the Unix command line.

40:37.739 --> 40:40.046
COMPUTER:
Ten, nine, eight...

40:40.089 --> 40:41.526
Now listen to me very carefully.

40:41.569 --> 40:43.397
...seven, six...[loud gunshots, shattering]

40:43.441 --> 40:45.225
Boss, what's happening?
Talk to me!

40:45.268 --> 40:47.357
Boss?

40:47.401 --> 40:49.098
Boss, what's happening?

40:49.142 --> 40:52.624
Are you okay?

40:52.667 --> 40:55.453
Can you hear me?

40:56.889 --> 40:59.892
Game over.

40:59.935 --> 41:00.936
COMPUTER:
Two...

41:00.980 --> 41:02.242
[gunshot]

41:02.285 --> 41:05.114
[faint crackling]

41:11.686 --> 41:14.167
I would have liked to see
Gibbs shoot that computer.

41:14.210 --> 41:15.995
Well, if I don't get
his e-mail working,

41:16.038 --> 41:17.649
you may get a second chance.

41:17.692 --> 41:19.302
I almost shot Tony last night.

41:19.346 --> 41:21.609
We were stuck for almost three
hours before the firemen

41:21.653 --> 41:23.481
were able to open
up the fire doors.

41:25.787 --> 41:26.788
And you loved
every second of it.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.185
Hi.

41:32.228 --> 41:34.361
Tony said you weren't going
to be at my debriefing.

41:35.928 --> 41:37.712
Uh, he did?
Yeah.

41:37.756 --> 41:39.584
But he passed along
your message.

41:39.627 --> 41:41.760
8:00 works great.

41:41.803 --> 41:44.240
See you then?

41:44.284 --> 41:46.068
And thank you.

41:53.206 --> 41:56.426
TONY:
Laser tag.

41:56.470 --> 41:57.819
You have a date.

41:57.863 --> 41:59.255
You didn't.

41:59.299 --> 42:01.519
Uh. Yes, I did.

42:06.828 --> 42:09.396
Thanks, Tony.

42:09.439 --> 42:11.572
Don't mention it.

42:11.616 --> 42:12.617
[computer beeps]

42:12.660 --> 42:14.488
McGee!

42:14.532 --> 42:16.751
I hate this
thing, McGee.
Oh, don't shoot!
