00:49.782 --> 00:51.715
Did I wake you?

00:51.750 --> 00:54.751
And you're so peaceful when you sleep.

00:54.787 --> 00:59.356
In fact, sleeping Snow
is my favorite Snow.

01:00.032 --> 01:01.925
Then what do you want?

01:01.961 --> 01:04.294
Do you remember your 15th birthday?

01:05.364 --> 01:07.064
You wanted a pony.

01:07.099 --> 01:08.665
Your father bought one.

01:09.614 --> 01:11.636
A miniature horse, really.

01:11.661 --> 01:13.270
Tiny as a dog.

01:14.310 --> 01:17.674
And he had a trainer work
with it for half a year.

01:19.928 --> 01:21.757
And then he brought you to the stables,

01:21.782 --> 01:25.160
to this sweet little horse.

01:26.080 --> 01:31.583
And when you went to it, it
did as it had been trained

01:31.756 --> 01:34.384
and bowed its head.

01:34.850 --> 01:39.208
Another loyal subject
eager to honor you.

01:39.454 --> 01:44.290
Oh, I've never seen such
delight as I did on your face

01:44.315 --> 01:49.918
when that tiny horse bowed to you.

01:49.954 --> 01:55.324
"This is my perfect day," you said.

01:56.485 --> 02:01.964
Your father always made
sure you got what you wanted.

02:01.999 --> 02:04.967
Plus a little bit more.

02:05.002 --> 02:09.738
Well, now I want what
I've always wanted...

02:13.509 --> 02:15.309
your heart in my hand.

02:17.282 --> 02:19.444
And since your husband
has half your heart,

02:19.469 --> 02:20.702
I get that, too.

02:22.487 --> 02:27.257
You see, that's a little bit more

02:27.292 --> 02:32.862
that'll make today my perfect day.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.766
Regina put a protection
spell on both of us

02:36.802 --> 02:40.436
the moment you rolled into town.

02:40.472 --> 02:42.672
You can't take them.

02:42.707 --> 02:45.508
Oh, did I say I would take them?

02:45.544 --> 02:48.244
No, I said you would hand them over...

02:48.280 --> 02:49.813
willingly.

02:50.529 --> 02:54.517
And this is how I know it will happen.

02:56.963 --> 02:58.288
What is this?

02:58.323 --> 03:00.031
What do you think?

03:00.056 --> 03:02.056
Something terrible.

03:02.327 --> 03:05.161
You have 12 hours to figure it out.

03:05.757 --> 03:07.497
And follow your conscience,

03:07.968 --> 03:10.500
or the whole town gets a taste of it.

03:10.995 --> 03:14.597
And it will be their
last taste of anything.

03:43.634 --> 03:46.868
Well, well. Hello, there.

03:47.172 --> 03:50.073
Oh, don't you two look
pretty and domestic.

03:50.785 --> 03:52.542
What terrible things
have you been up to?

03:52.577 --> 03:54.210
You look like you're having a good day.

03:54.246 --> 03:56.504
Oh, it's a perfect day.

03:57.090 --> 04:00.758
I'm finally getting my
revenge on Snow White.

04:00.860 --> 04:03.586
And Prince Farming thrown in as a bonus.

04:03.953 --> 04:07.523
Soon I'll have their little shared heart

04:08.192 --> 04:10.727
beating in the palm of my hand.

04:10.762 --> 04:14.664
You seem confident. Is
the Dark One helping you?

04:14.793 --> 04:16.762
Is that why he dropped by yesterday?

04:17.369 --> 04:18.769
Yes.

04:19.267 --> 04:22.572
It was a... productive conversation.

04:22.607 --> 04:24.321
Lots of give-and-take.

04:24.346 --> 04:26.086
What did you give, and what did he take?

04:26.111 --> 04:28.561
Oh, he wanted the Shears of Destiny,

04:28.586 --> 04:30.719
so I fished them up for him.

04:31.205 --> 04:32.404
He was grateful.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.417
Hmm. I'll bet.

04:34.452 --> 04:36.052
Oh, now, now, sis.

04:36.332 --> 04:38.699
Don't start insinuating anything.

04:38.724 --> 04:41.799
We're simply old friends.

04:41.824 --> 04:44.354
Of course. I didn't mean a thing.

04:47.719 --> 04:49.072
Well, I'd love to stay

04:49.097 --> 04:51.846
and burp the baby with you, but...

04:52.798 --> 04:56.097
I've simply got tons to do
before Snow's last breath.

05:04.072 --> 05:05.004
Sir.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.573
Sir.

05:06.641 --> 05:10.310
Can I interest you
in a piece of jewelry?

05:10.345 --> 05:12.846
You don't look like a peddler.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.216
I'm not.

05:15.342 --> 05:18.119
There was an emergency and
I've been forced to sell.

05:18.144 --> 05:21.645
That would make a lovely
gift for your wife.

05:22.729 --> 05:25.518
I'll give you three coppers.

05:26.284 --> 05:30.321
Sir, I'm sure you realize
it is worth 100 times that.

05:30.357 --> 05:31.990
That is a family heirloom.

05:33.827 --> 05:38.596
I only know of one family
with heirlooms that valuable.

05:39.445 --> 05:40.965
What is your name?

05:42.437 --> 05:44.302
Three coppers would be fine,

05:44.337 --> 05:45.636
just fine.

05:49.209 --> 05:50.508
Thank you.

06:11.464 --> 06:13.464
You couldn't find the lost lamb, I see.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.600
Oh, well, we found it,
but it was too late.

06:15.635 --> 06:17.168
The night was just too cold.

06:17.797 --> 06:19.697
We can't build up the flock this way.

06:19.756 --> 06:21.920
The winters are too long
and the flock is too small.

06:21.945 --> 06:23.207
The weather, it will turn.

06:23.243 --> 06:26.778
And Wilby's the best
tracking dog I've ever known.

06:27.236 --> 06:28.469
Mother, we'll be fine.

06:28.494 --> 06:30.581
I know what the farm means to you.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.184
I've been thinking about that.

06:33.732 --> 06:35.153
Thinking about what?

06:35.188 --> 06:37.344
If we had the money to
make this place a success,

06:37.369 --> 06:38.656
I'd never leave.

06:38.691 --> 06:40.458
But the way things are going, it's...

06:41.728 --> 06:46.264
Son, I know giving up
isn't in your nature,

06:46.894 --> 06:49.434
but I think it's time to admit defeat

06:49.469 --> 06:52.870
and sell the farm.

07:01.881 --> 07:03.781
You only got three coppers?

07:03.982 --> 07:04.847
He was onto me.

07:04.872 --> 07:05.750
If I'd done anything else,

07:05.785 --> 07:07.085
he would've turned me over to the queen.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.393
How do you know he won't anyway?

07:08.418 --> 07:11.087
Oh, I know his type...
corrupt and greedy.

07:11.112 --> 07:13.140
He's just happy to have
gotten something of value

07:13.165 --> 07:14.844
for next to nothing.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.194
He won't tip anyone off.

07:16.229 --> 07:18.429
I think you might be
wrong about that. Run!

07:20.800 --> 07:21.666
Aah!

07:47.060 --> 07:48.626
Who was he?

07:48.661 --> 07:49.961
Must be the Woodcutter...

07:49.996 --> 07:52.029
bounty hunter who usually specializes

07:52.065 --> 07:53.631
in hunting down werewolves.

07:54.579 --> 07:56.100
That nobleman must have tipped him off

07:56.136 --> 07:58.002
about the price on my head.

07:58.037 --> 08:00.872
Blue, I can't stay here. I have to go.

08:00.907 --> 08:03.953
I'm a princess, a
princess without a kingdom!

08:03.978 --> 08:06.345
The forest is no place for me.

08:06.940 --> 08:10.567
I have sold everything
my parents gave me,

08:10.592 --> 08:13.751
and I have just enough to book
passage on a boat out of here,

08:14.129 --> 08:15.395
out of her reach.

08:16.058 --> 08:17.776
Maybe the head of some
allied nation will take me in.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.724
Wait, wait! You're going right now?

08:19.759 --> 08:21.392
There's nothing holding me here.

08:21.921 --> 08:23.688
I'm headed to the nearest port town.

08:23.713 --> 08:25.062
I hear there's one not far from here.

08:25.707 --> 08:26.898
Longbourn.

08:35.909 --> 08:37.275
Thank you, son.

08:37.923 --> 08:39.076
Have a safe journey.

08:39.111 --> 08:40.178
Of course.

08:40.246 --> 08:42.547
I won't return until I find a buyer.

08:42.994 --> 08:43.813
Where I'm headed,

08:43.850 --> 08:46.851
it's filled with noblemen
who see an opportunity.

08:47.541 --> 08:51.355
And this farm, they'll see value.

08:51.391 --> 08:52.890
How long will you be?

08:52.926 --> 08:53.891
Not long.

08:55.762 --> 08:58.396
It's only a day's journey to Longbourn.

09:07.907 --> 09:11.475
If we don't give in to her,
she'll use that on everyone?

09:11.511 --> 09:13.775
Yes.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.179
So, what is it?

09:15.215 --> 09:16.881
She told me to figure it
out and that if we didn't

09:16.916 --> 09:19.150
give over our hearts within 12 hours,

09:19.185 --> 09:21.352
she would use it on the whole town.

09:22.158 --> 09:23.454
You okay?

09:23.489 --> 09:25.437
No, but I have an
excuse. Haven't you heard?

09:25.462 --> 09:27.619
The Evil Queen's trying
to kill my parents.

09:28.017 --> 09:30.461
You said we were alive and well
in your vision of the future.

09:30.496 --> 09:32.730
The Oracle said things
could kind of change

09:33.312 --> 09:34.496
as we went along,

09:34.521 --> 09:35.566
but the only thing that was certain

09:35.602 --> 09:36.500
was that I died.

09:36.536 --> 09:38.002
Speaking of death,

09:38.037 --> 09:39.704
I think I know what this is.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.555
Whoa.

09:57.975 --> 09:59.827
What kind of potion is that?

09:59.852 --> 10:03.020
It's not a potion. It's water.

10:03.129 --> 10:04.892
Oh, I knew it. Never trusted the stuff.

10:04.917 --> 10:06.130
Rum would never do that.

10:06.165 --> 10:07.798
What kind of water?

10:07.834 --> 10:09.500
From the River of Lost Souls.

10:12.672 --> 10:13.704
Gold.

10:13.740 --> 10:15.339
She's working with Gold.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.642
He brought it back from the Underworld.

10:18.466 --> 10:21.479
And now, if you don't
give her your hearts,

10:21.514 --> 10:24.148
she can destroy the whole town.

10:35.816 --> 10:37.715
So many people.

10:40.187 --> 10:42.120
And if we don't sacrifice ourselves,

10:42.155 --> 10:44.155
they all die.

10:44.202 --> 10:46.902
Not to mention what happens to Emma.

10:46.927 --> 10:49.894
What if all of this
just leads to her vision?

10:49.930 --> 10:54.124
What if this is just the
path to our daughter's death?

10:54.149 --> 10:55.533
Don't give up.

10:55.569 --> 10:57.996
I'm not giving up. I wouldn't give up.

10:58.021 --> 11:00.721
I will fight for her
until my last breath.

11:01.193 --> 11:02.841
But what if this destiny can't be beat

11:02.909 --> 11:05.805
and we're just moving towards it?

11:07.008 --> 11:09.532
I don't know that we'll
ever get back to normal.

11:10.102 --> 11:12.591
The Evil Queen's finally got us.

11:20.565 --> 11:22.327
What did you find, Wilby?

11:22.635 --> 11:23.634
A cup.

11:24.285 --> 11:25.997
Why don't you let me hold your treasure?

11:26.032 --> 11:26.998
Come on.

11:27.033 --> 11:29.321
We got to get to Longbourn before dark.

11:31.367 --> 11:33.571
Wilby! Wilby!

11:36.543 --> 11:38.977
Wilby!

11:39.012 --> 11:40.645
Wilby!

11:43.850 --> 11:45.116
Wilby!

11:50.323 --> 11:51.756
Can I help you?

11:52.119 --> 11:53.297
Oh, sorry to intrude.

11:53.322 --> 11:55.544
My dog got something into his head.

11:55.569 --> 11:57.444
Say, that's my cup you have there.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.278
Went over a bump a while
back and dropped it.

11:59.303 --> 12:00.434
I thought it was lost.

12:00.459 --> 12:01.432
Not good for a traveling merchant

12:01.455 --> 12:02.787
to be so careless with his goods.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.062
Well, that explains it then.

12:04.087 --> 12:06.057
Wilby must've gotten the scent of it.

12:06.390 --> 12:08.582
My mother says he's a
bloodhound in a sweater.

12:08.607 --> 12:10.107
Sorry it's a little battered.

12:10.132 --> 12:11.608
Oh, that's all right.

12:11.633 --> 12:13.944
Worth it to see such a
fine animal like this.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.668
You are a fine little fella, aren't you?

12:18.071 --> 12:20.305
Made camp here last night
so no brigands would find me.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.239
Brigands?

12:21.275 --> 12:22.307
Oh, yes.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.309
I usually never travel this road alone.

12:24.539 --> 12:25.672
Say, which way are you headed?

12:25.887 --> 12:26.819
To Longbourn.

12:27.029 --> 12:28.410
Fate has smiled upon our heads.

12:28.435 --> 12:30.021
That's exactly where I'm headed.

12:30.046 --> 12:31.512
Perhaps we can travel together.

12:31.548 --> 12:33.114
That sounds fine.

12:33.149 --> 12:34.015
Hop on up.

12:34.050 --> 12:35.817
I'm eager to get started for the day.

12:52.235 --> 12:54.035
Do you really have to go, Princess Snow?

12:54.070 --> 12:55.303
The fairies can help you.

12:55.338 --> 12:57.572
Surely there is a way other
than leaving your home.

12:57.607 --> 12:58.806
Home is where your family is,

12:58.842 --> 13:00.034
and by now, that's pretty much

13:00.059 --> 13:01.720
just the woman who's trying to kill me.

13:01.745 --> 13:03.511
There's an old fairy saying.

13:03.546 --> 13:06.280
If someone believes in
you, you are never alone.

13:06.316 --> 13:07.882
All the people love you.

13:07.917 --> 13:08.983
Love.

13:09.018 --> 13:11.535
Love is the most powerful
magic in the world.

13:11.560 --> 13:12.553
Really?

13:12.815 --> 13:14.481
You know that broach I sold?

13:14.746 --> 13:18.114
My father gave that to my
mother because he loved her.

13:19.071 --> 13:21.238
She treasured it
because it was from him.

13:21.827 --> 13:23.374
After she died, you know what he did?

13:23.399 --> 13:25.532
He gave it to Regina
because he loved her, too.

13:25.557 --> 13:27.156
She treated it like trash.

13:27.871 --> 13:30.071
His love meant everything to my mother

13:30.106 --> 13:31.759
and nothing to my step-mother.

13:31.784 --> 13:34.133
See, love doesn't hold its value.

13:34.339 --> 13:36.005
The only thing that's
maintained its value

13:36.041 --> 13:38.241
this entire time is the broach,

13:38.982 --> 13:42.223
and I can't afford to
invest in anything less.

13:42.248 --> 13:43.581
This?

13:43.616 --> 13:45.683
This can buy me something
that can actually

13:45.708 --> 13:47.608
change my life... a ticket out of here.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.128
Goodbye, Blue.

13:50.857 --> 13:51.789
Be careful.

13:51.824 --> 13:54.225
Danger can look harmless at first.

14:04.207 --> 14:05.840
You don't seem shocked that Gold

14:05.865 --> 14:07.545
brought some of this back
and gave it to the queen.

14:07.570 --> 14:11.138
I'm not. He's not acting
like the man he could be.

14:12.254 --> 14:13.620
I wish I could help.

14:14.293 --> 14:17.722
But I-I've looked through all
my books for any information

14:17.747 --> 14:20.514
on... on how to neutralize
water from the River of Souls,

14:20.550 --> 14:23.117
but I'm afraid there's nothing.

14:23.152 --> 14:24.912
I'll keep looking.

14:28.858 --> 14:31.025
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I came quickly as I could.

14:31.060 --> 14:32.994
David called and told me what happened.

14:33.029 --> 14:34.161
Can you help?

14:35.024 --> 14:36.719
Unfortunately, I don't have a way

14:36.744 --> 14:38.366
to counteract the Lost Souls water.

14:38.401 --> 14:41.302
So we either let the whole town die,

14:41.337 --> 14:45.306
or the Evil Queen gets exactly
what she's always wanted.

14:46.662 --> 14:49.669
Maybe. But there is a bit of magic

14:49.694 --> 14:50.907
that just might be powerful enough

14:50.932 --> 14:52.732
to imprison the Evil Queen.

14:53.983 --> 14:55.583
It's a sapling.

14:55.618 --> 14:56.851
A baby tree?

14:56.886 --> 14:59.420
It was created by the
first spark of a true love.

14:59.455 --> 15:00.588
It's incredibly rare.

15:00.623 --> 15:01.689
Have you got one?

15:01.724 --> 15:04.025
We had one, back in
the Enchanted Forest.

15:04.060 --> 15:05.826
We assumed that it was
left behind in the curse,

15:05.862 --> 15:07.061
but now we think it might be lost

15:07.096 --> 15:08.329
somewhere here in Storybrooke.

15:08.364 --> 15:11.632
There has to be some, like,
magical way to find it, right?

15:11.668 --> 15:13.567
There is... a spell
that could point the way

15:13.603 --> 15:14.669
with a sort of beacon.

15:14.704 --> 15:17.705
But it wouldn't be visible just to us.

15:17.740 --> 15:20.441
If Gold or the queen
or even Zelena saw it,

15:20.476 --> 15:22.168
they would know exactly what it was.

15:22.193 --> 15:23.826
And then we'd have a race on our hands.

15:23.980 --> 15:26.047
Maybe not.

15:26.504 --> 15:27.903
What?

15:30.653 --> 15:35.523
The Evil Queen and Gold's alliance,

15:35.558 --> 15:39.293
there, um, may be more
to it than business.

15:41.022 --> 15:44.045
Rumple and I...

15:45.428 --> 15:48.803
there was always a certain
amount of chemistry.

15:49.939 --> 15:51.539
Regina, oh, my God.

15:51.564 --> 15:53.847
I know. I... know.

15:53.999 --> 15:55.398
Nothing ever happened.

15:55.423 --> 15:58.191
But I think we can use
this to our advantage.

16:04.496 --> 16:09.182
_

16:12.103 --> 16:13.601
Thanks for the special delivery.

16:32.203 --> 16:33.436
Hello?

16:52.869 --> 16:56.670
Maybe we should take this
someplace more comfortable.

16:56.706 --> 16:59.406
Yes. Like a bed of lies.

17:08.713 --> 17:09.846
Just let me past.

17:09.881 --> 17:10.983
No, we need to talk.

17:11.008 --> 17:13.693
I don't think so. I saw
what you wanted me to see.

17:13.718 --> 17:15.384
I didn't want you to see it.

17:15.420 --> 17:16.452
You lied to me.

17:16.487 --> 17:18.421
Only because I knew you'd be jealous.

17:18.455 --> 17:20.306
I'm not jealous, not of you.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.329
Not ever.

17:21.355 --> 17:22.090
Really?

17:22.126 --> 17:23.992
Well, then what's wrong with your neck?

17:24.901 --> 17:25.994
Growing moldy?

17:27.265 --> 17:30.366
We were supposed to
be a team. No secrets.

17:30.401 --> 17:31.868
Spa days and sisterhood.

17:31.903 --> 17:33.603
We were gonna run over
this town together.

17:33.638 --> 17:34.537
And now what?

17:34.572 --> 17:35.689
He's riding on your handlebars

17:35.714 --> 17:37.180
and I'm just sitting in the sidecar?

17:37.205 --> 17:38.437
You need to calm down.

17:41.330 --> 17:42.278
What's this?

17:43.567 --> 17:45.815
Ask her. She wrote it.

17:45.884 --> 17:47.383
Wanted to rub my nose in it.

17:51.082 --> 17:52.255
I didn't write this.

17:52.290 --> 17:55.691
No. Someone with your handwriting did.

17:57.161 --> 17:58.327
Regina.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.633
We're being played.

18:13.478 --> 18:15.611
There, where the light has landed.

18:15.647 --> 18:16.935
That's where you'll find the sapling.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.192
Regina can magic Snow and
me out there to find it.

18:19.217 --> 18:20.816
We just need to figure
out where we're gonna put

18:20.852 --> 18:21.908
the Evil Queen once we've got her.

18:21.933 --> 18:22.718
My vault.

18:22.754 --> 18:24.510
I've taken all the blood
magic off the locks,

18:24.535 --> 18:25.832
so it should hold her.

18:25.857 --> 18:28.281
But there's still a lot of
dangerous stuff in there.

18:28.306 --> 18:30.040
Hook and I can pack it all up.

18:30.098 --> 18:31.030
All right, let's go.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.331
Dad, just be careful, okay?

18:32.367 --> 18:35.168
Don't worry. I'm in good company.

18:38.406 --> 18:40.173
I didn't think we'd break so soon.

18:40.198 --> 18:42.598
Oh, my poor old horse
needs a good many breaks.

18:43.139 --> 18:45.506
And I like to take a
look at the local scenery.

18:45.539 --> 18:47.113
Don't think Wilby's complaining, either.

18:48.283 --> 18:51.284
Drink up. No more breaks after this.

18:51.319 --> 18:54.787
We can make it all the way
to Longbourn in one leg.

18:54.823 --> 18:56.055
Thanks.

19:02.409 --> 19:03.541
You all right, mate?

19:08.135 --> 19:11.003
Oh, mate, you shouldn't
take drinks from strangers.

19:21.310 --> 19:22.548
He's just sleeping.

19:23.218 --> 19:26.018
And I have a fun game for you
and me to play in the meantime.

19:47.895 --> 19:51.630
Oh, hey. Where did you come from?

19:54.847 --> 19:57.383
I see you met my friend.

19:57.418 --> 19:58.951
The Woodcutter.

20:00.025 --> 20:01.958
How did you find me?

20:02.258 --> 20:05.057
You're nothing but a lost princess.

20:05.093 --> 20:07.693
And I came across an
excellent sheep dog.

20:08.276 --> 20:10.329
They're great at finding strays.

20:10.365 --> 20:13.533
They just need to get a scent.

20:20.427 --> 20:23.342
Oh, come on. I'm not gonna kill you.

20:23.367 --> 20:25.678
I'm just gonna take you to
the queen and get a reward.

20:26.721 --> 20:27.925
She'll kill you.

20:32.086 --> 20:33.920
Look. There.

20:33.955 --> 20:35.388
That's where the beacon hit.

20:35.423 --> 20:36.422
Come on.

20:36.898 --> 20:39.225
Hey, you know where we are?

20:39.929 --> 20:40.490
Yeah.

20:40.515 --> 20:41.914
Where you found me during the curse,

20:41.939 --> 20:44.273
when I wandered out of the hospital.

20:44.298 --> 20:45.242
Where you saved me.

20:46.281 --> 20:47.534
What are the chances?

20:48.203 --> 20:49.936
Think it's a sign?

20:50.885 --> 20:52.171
I think...

20:52.566 --> 20:54.841
I don't know what to believe anymore.

20:55.275 --> 20:58.755
Except that it's good to be
on an adventure with you again.

20:59.735 --> 21:00.816
It's always good.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.574
Hey, lovebirds. Found something.

21:09.392 --> 21:10.591
Here.

21:13.570 --> 21:15.737
It's a trap door.

21:21.411 --> 21:22.811
You ready?

21:22.846 --> 21:24.412
Always.

21:25.126 --> 21:26.759
Then hang on.

21:40.766 --> 21:42.538
What is adder's fork?

21:42.671 --> 21:43.870
Snake's tongue.

21:43.895 --> 21:44.878
There was some of that in the thing

21:44.903 --> 21:46.527
I had to drink to find Aladdin.

21:46.679 --> 21:48.513
And you kiss me with that mouth?

21:48.538 --> 21:49.484
Let's get this up to Henry

21:49.509 --> 21:52.143
so he can pack the Bug
before the new tenant comes.

21:52.356 --> 21:54.381
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, Hang on, hang on.

21:54.406 --> 21:55.647
Look at me, look at me.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.391
You're worried about your parents,

21:58.627 --> 22:01.630
and that's making this worse,
but they're gonna be all right.

22:02.546 --> 22:05.283
They're gonna find that
magic little baby tree thing

22:05.308 --> 22:07.108
and defeat the Evil Queen.

22:07.626 --> 22:09.265
They're gonna find that
magic little tree thing?

22:09.290 --> 22:10.478
Yeah, that's right.

22:10.824 --> 22:11.885
What if they don't?

22:11.910 --> 22:13.314
What if the Evil Queen gets there first

22:13.350 --> 22:14.549
and I'm not ready for a fight?

22:15.852 --> 22:17.655
All right. Come here.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.054
Sit down.

22:20.091 --> 22:23.958
I borrowed Henry's book.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.995
I wanted to tell you a story.

22:27.030 --> 22:29.902
- Killian...
- Shh, shh, shh. Shush, shush, shush.

22:30.424 --> 22:31.456
It's story time.

22:35.287 --> 22:35.937
Okay.

22:35.972 --> 22:38.473
Once upon a time, the Evil Queen vowed

22:38.508 --> 22:41.676
to kill Snow White
and separate these two.

22:42.637 --> 22:48.116
But no matter what she tried,
they always found each other.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.500
And then...

22:51.774 --> 22:52.973
they found you.

22:56.406 --> 22:58.940
And you inherited the
strength of that love.

22:59.171 --> 23:02.530
So then, even when they
couldn't find each other,

23:03.191 --> 23:05.157
you made sure they did.

23:07.307 --> 23:09.237
True love can break any
curse, and so can you

23:09.272 --> 23:11.239
because that's what you're made of.

23:11.758 --> 23:15.074
You are the savior because
you were born of their love.

23:15.636 --> 23:16.791
And they're in love today

23:16.816 --> 23:18.615
because you brought them together.

23:18.640 --> 23:22.375
You... you can overcome these visions.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.268
You can overcome anything.

23:27.675 --> 23:31.026
Now remember who you are.

23:35.261 --> 23:37.832
The product of true love.

24:03.302 --> 24:04.568
Gabriel.

24:18.777 --> 24:20.844
Hello? Is anyone in there?

24:20.870 --> 24:23.338
Yes! The Woodcutter locked me in!

24:23.582 --> 24:25.182
Big lock on the door.

24:25.207 --> 24:27.050
The Woodcutter will be back any second.

24:27.086 --> 24:28.177
If he catches you, he'll kill you.

24:28.202 --> 24:29.442
You need to go!

24:36.462 --> 24:37.494
Oh!

24:54.016 --> 24:55.039
There it is.

24:55.064 --> 24:56.797
Get it.

25:03.746 --> 25:04.578
Follow me!

25:04.603 --> 25:05.210
Snow!

25:05.235 --> 25:07.272
Aren't you a real Prince Charming.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.749
You... You saved me.

25:08.774 --> 25:09.960
I thought I'd lost you forever.

25:09.995 --> 25:11.140
May the love between you

25:11.165 --> 25:13.655
always be strong, true, and eternal.

25:13.866 --> 25:16.600
If you need anything,
I will always find you.

25:16.635 --> 25:17.634
Do you promise?

25:17.670 --> 25:18.769
I do.

25:18.804 --> 25:23.640
Knowing you believe in
me means I'm not alone.

25:23.676 --> 25:25.475
Come back to me.

25:26.635 --> 25:27.901
What was that?

25:30.816 --> 25:32.015
The sapling.

25:32.584 --> 25:34.951
Blue said that it was
created from true love.

25:34.987 --> 25:38.622
Maybe that's just what it does...

25:38.657 --> 25:40.590
shows you your own true love?

25:42.056 --> 25:43.694
As if we needed reminding.

25:44.681 --> 25:45.892
David, how much did you see?

25:45.917 --> 25:47.252
There was something I couldn't quite...

25:47.277 --> 25:48.133
This is really sweet,

25:48.158 --> 25:50.477
but can we please go and defeat someone?

25:50.502 --> 25:52.135
We don't have long.

25:54.487 --> 25:55.701
So true.

25:56.909 --> 25:58.775
Time flies.

26:02.874 --> 26:04.173
You've won nothing.

26:04.208 --> 26:05.827
That sapling is made of pure love.

26:05.852 --> 26:07.524
It won't work for you.

26:07.549 --> 26:10.274
Oh, won't it? Hmm.

26:10.299 --> 26:14.501
Well, maybe it just needs a firm hand.

26:17.629 --> 26:19.355
Oh, dear.

26:19.863 --> 26:21.657
Well, maybe it can be repaired.

26:23.194 --> 26:24.093
Oh.

26:25.329 --> 26:27.430
Maybe not.

26:28.309 --> 26:31.678
Do you want to beat the rush
and hand those hearts over now?

26:31.703 --> 26:34.003
No, no. We still have some time.

26:34.765 --> 26:36.338
True.

26:36.845 --> 26:39.694
Read a book, pick a flower,

26:39.719 --> 26:43.322
rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

26:43.576 --> 26:46.477
Just do it quickly.

26:46.502 --> 26:48.835
I'll see you at the
cemetery soon enough.

26:51.055 --> 26:53.322
It's a good place for endings.

27:10.509 --> 27:12.576
Granny says Neal's doing fine.

27:12.611 --> 27:13.944
She's good with him.

27:14.603 --> 27:16.377
He's got a lot of people who love him.

27:16.402 --> 27:17.334
Mm.

27:19.451 --> 27:21.985
David, we don't have much time.

27:22.020 --> 27:24.521
And we have no choice.

27:24.556 --> 27:28.525
The town, we can't...
we can't let it die.

27:32.264 --> 27:33.730
I know.

27:40.839 --> 27:44.107
She's going to have our
hearts, after all these years.

27:44.618 --> 27:46.877
I have no idea what
she's gonna do with them.

27:46.904 --> 27:49.605
If only we had...

27:49.648 --> 27:50.580
saved the sapling.

27:50.616 --> 27:52.272
I mean, did you feel the power in it?

27:52.297 --> 27:53.630
Yes.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.286
And I keep thinking of
everything it showed us,

27:56.321 --> 27:57.387
all those memories.

27:57.422 --> 27:59.055
Did you hear in the flashes,

28:00.580 --> 28:03.160
"Knowing you believe in me,

28:03.195 --> 28:05.228
that means I'm not alone"?

28:05.928 --> 28:07.355
It's still true.

28:09.589 --> 28:10.690
David.

28:12.971 --> 28:15.739
That was a memory, but...

28:16.149 --> 28:17.549
it was my memory.

28:17.902 --> 28:18.646
What?

28:18.671 --> 28:19.388
Think about it.

28:19.413 --> 28:22.948
Every moment we saw was a memory
we shared, except that one.

28:23.282 --> 28:27.376
The... The words,
handing over the coins.

28:27.681 --> 28:29.986
You weren't even there for that.

28:30.779 --> 28:31.931
No.

28:33.461 --> 28:34.676
You weren't.

28:35.965 --> 28:37.514
Or were you?

28:43.480 --> 28:44.848
It's no use!

28:44.873 --> 28:46.673
Run away before it's too late!

28:50.437 --> 28:51.503
Aah!

29:13.755 --> 29:14.754
Get him!

29:25.682 --> 29:26.754
We did it.

29:32.066 --> 29:34.366
Let's get you out of there.

29:34.402 --> 29:35.634
Wait!

29:36.771 --> 29:37.870
Don't.

29:37.905 --> 29:39.531
No, it's okay. You'll be sa...

29:39.556 --> 29:42.357
Yes, but it's your safety
that should concern you.

29:42.577 --> 29:46.145
I, uh... I've made some enemies.

29:46.819 --> 29:49.415
If you see my face,

29:49.450 --> 29:52.685
there will be a target on your back.

29:56.056 --> 29:57.804
Okay.

29:58.545 --> 30:00.578
As you wish.

30:01.165 --> 30:04.497
After I'm gone, you
can let yourself out.

30:04.532 --> 30:05.931
Thank you.

30:10.410 --> 30:13.344
What are you doing out
here alone in the woods?

30:13.380 --> 30:14.339
Oh...

30:16.098 --> 30:17.148
Trying to survive,

30:17.183 --> 30:20.985
and not doing a very good job of it.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.778
Well, I'm impressed.

30:23.803 --> 30:25.163
You're very resourceful.

30:25.188 --> 30:27.422
I don't know about that.

30:28.336 --> 30:31.129
Wh-What were you doing on this road?

30:33.605 --> 30:37.240
I was headed to Longbourn
to sell my mother's farm.

30:40.269 --> 30:42.636
I'm afraid we need the money.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.576
I have money.

30:45.612 --> 30:46.654
What?

30:46.858 --> 30:48.958
Yeah, I was going to... never mind.

30:49.574 --> 30:52.152
You should have it, uh, as
a reward for rescuing me.

30:52.177 --> 30:53.159
No, I can't accept it.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.598
Surely whatever you needed
it for, you still do.

30:56.241 --> 31:00.566
Maybe not. Maybe I am resourceful.

31:03.346 --> 31:07.009
There's a... a pretty corrupt nobleman

31:07.357 --> 31:10.191
who rides his carriage
through my territory a lot.

31:11.516 --> 31:14.116
It just might happen
that some of his fine cash

31:14.152 --> 31:16.652
is liberated as he passes through.

31:16.688 --> 31:17.887
I'll find a way.

31:18.675 --> 31:20.957
Sounds dangerous.

31:21.366 --> 31:23.366
You sure you want to do it alone?

31:25.530 --> 31:28.264
I don't feel so alone right now.

31:29.162 --> 31:34.003
Knowing you believe in
me means I'm not alone.

32:12.516 --> 32:15.851
People of Storybrooke.

32:17.087 --> 32:18.687
My people.

32:18.722 --> 32:21.189
I'm so glad you accepted my invitation

32:21.225 --> 32:25.227
because this is about you.

32:26.537 --> 32:31.633
If Snow White doesn't show
up in the next five minutes,

32:31.669 --> 32:34.480
I'm going to share a
little treat with you all.

32:35.672 --> 32:40.742
A taste of water from
the River of Lost Souls.

32:40.778 --> 32:41.942
Looks like you don't have to worry

32:41.967 --> 32:44.000
about that blasted river water, do you?

32:44.615 --> 32:47.416
Not since your husband struck
a deal with the Evil Queen.

32:48.094 --> 32:51.437
I don't care about the
deals that my husband makes.

32:51.760 --> 32:52.998
Are you sure?

32:53.023 --> 32:54.723
I mean, wouldn't like to know

32:54.758 --> 32:58.193
the rest of what those
two have been up to?

33:04.076 --> 33:05.342
You ready?

33:05.368 --> 33:06.835
I actually am.

33:06.870 --> 33:08.870
All right, it's time.

33:08.905 --> 33:10.438
Wait!

33:18.548 --> 33:23.451
Well, well, well. Look
who's right on time.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.587
I should've known you'd show up.

33:25.965 --> 33:28.365
Even without your precious sapling.

33:28.750 --> 33:31.226
We don't have the sapling,
but we don't need it.

33:31.261 --> 33:32.560
It's done its work.

33:33.853 --> 33:35.328
We know our love is more powerful

33:35.353 --> 33:36.848
than anything you can throw at us.

33:36.873 --> 33:38.473
And to save the people of Storybrooke,

33:38.498 --> 33:40.899
we're willing to do what you ask.

33:40.934 --> 33:43.301
It's a sacrifice we need to make.

33:44.129 --> 33:46.137
We're going to do the right thing.

33:48.141 --> 33:50.441
Dad, Mom?

33:52.479 --> 33:54.954
Emma, most people go through life

33:54.995 --> 33:56.951
never knowing where their
paths will take them,

33:56.976 --> 34:00.931
but somehow we always do.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.461
It's always to each other
and then back to you.

34:06.425 --> 34:07.559
Are you sure?

34:07.594 --> 34:08.458
Yes.

34:08.495 --> 34:10.628
Lift the protection spell.

34:57.890 --> 35:02.580
I've dreamt of this moment
for so long, Snow White.

35:03.547 --> 35:09.181
I'd wake up still feeling
the grit of your crushed heart

35:09.206 --> 35:12.074
clinging to my palms.

35:14.171 --> 35:18.540
But that ending isn't
poetic enough, is it?

35:23.280 --> 35:26.915
I want to give you...

35:26.950 --> 35:30.485
my pain...

35:30.520 --> 35:33.188
the pain of being alone.

35:36.940 --> 35:38.988
And since I couldn't
quite accomplish that

35:39.013 --> 35:40.479
by killing you...

35:42.866 --> 35:46.234
I've come up with
something much more cruel.

36:07.803 --> 36:09.272
A sleeping curse?

36:09.297 --> 36:10.992
That's never kept us apart before.

36:11.027 --> 36:13.595
This one has a little twist.

36:18.012 --> 36:22.337
You say you always find her.

36:22.868 --> 36:26.074
Well, start looking, Shepherd.

36:26.109 --> 36:29.944
And let's see what happens when you do.

36:50.252 --> 36:51.361
Belle.

36:53.689 --> 36:56.957
I've been meaning to thank you for this.

36:56.992 --> 37:00.427
Zelena told me about
you and the Evil Queen.

37:03.101 --> 37:04.243
Well, then.

37:05.601 --> 37:08.869
I know it's trite to say
it doesn't mean anything.

37:08.904 --> 37:11.972
Oh, I-I don't care about
what you do right now

37:12.007 --> 37:13.640
or with whom you do it.

37:14.087 --> 37:17.334
But she also told me about the shears.

37:17.359 --> 37:21.227
Now, that... that I do care about.

37:21.428 --> 37:25.029
She said that you're going
to use them on our son

37:25.144 --> 37:28.300
the first moment you can,
the moment that he's born,

37:28.335 --> 37:30.335
to cut him off from his future.

37:30.370 --> 37:32.437
Well, I won't allow that.

37:32.472 --> 37:35.702
You don't get to tamper with his life

37:36.171 --> 37:37.567
just to keep him from hating you.

37:37.592 --> 37:38.930
I forbid it.

37:38.955 --> 37:39.734
Look...

37:41.214 --> 37:43.481
The things I do,

37:44.094 --> 37:47.319
they're driven by the love of my son.

37:47.354 --> 37:50.455
That excuse, that...
that doesn't work anymore.

37:51.184 --> 37:53.417
If you were pure evil, like the queen,

37:53.442 --> 37:57.052
then maybe I could forgive you
because that's all you could be.

37:58.699 --> 38:02.667
But you... you do feel love,

38:03.087 --> 38:09.040
and you could be a
good man if you tried.

38:09.109 --> 38:13.144
You want your son's love. Don't take it.

38:13.180 --> 38:15.647
Be worthy of it.

38:21.221 --> 38:23.073
And what if I fail?

38:24.514 --> 38:26.547
Listen to yourself.

38:27.073 --> 38:29.761
That's just you all over, isn't it?

38:29.796 --> 38:31.663
Afraid of failing.

38:31.888 --> 38:34.222
That's worse than being evil.

38:34.247 --> 38:39.159
That's... That's just
being too weak to be good.

38:49.983 --> 38:51.283
Zelena.

38:54.588 --> 38:55.587
Snow!

38:56.677 --> 38:58.023
Snow?

39:03.116 --> 39:04.415
The woods.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.331
Where she sent her before.

40:01.273 --> 40:02.954
Dad!

40:07.648 --> 40:10.528
I don't think a kiss is
going to do it this time.

40:11.001 --> 40:12.313
Just let him try.

40:43.761 --> 40:45.060
How about that.

40:53.364 --> 40:54.363
Dad!

40:57.011 --> 40:58.577
David?

40:58.668 --> 40:59.633
David?

40:59.880 --> 41:01.980
What happened? What did she do?

41:07.540 --> 41:10.755
She put a sleeping curse on your heart,

41:10.791 --> 41:12.557
the heart you share.

41:12.592 --> 41:15.360
So now you share the curse.

41:15.395 --> 41:19.464
When one of you is awake,
the other will be asleep.

41:20.667 --> 41:23.748
So, as long as the curse is unbroken...

41:26.740 --> 41:29.207
Then we'll never be together.
