01:14.874 --> 01:16.899
<i>Sometimes I wonder...</i>

01:17.010 --> 01:19.808
<i>how I got to be the way I am.</i>

01:23.316 --> 01:27.150
<i>Most fathers have big dreams
for their little girls.</i>

01:29.456 --> 01:33.984
<i>For me, it was to become a concert pianist.</i>

01:38.364 --> 01:42.232
<i>But life never turns out the way we expect.</i>

01:43.670 --> 01:45.831
<i>And when we moved to hong Kong...</i>

01:45.939 --> 01:47.839
<i>everything changed.</i>

02:14.234 --> 02:17.795
<i>My father was an important businessman.</i>

02:17.904 --> 02:20.464
<i>I never Knew exactly
what he did for a living...</i>

02:20.573 --> 02:22.700
<i>but we always moved around a lot.</i>

02:22.809 --> 02:25.505
<i>For me, home was always where my family was.</i>

02:25.612 --> 02:27.580
Ah.

02:27.680 --> 02:28.647
hi.

03:19.966 --> 03:21.058
huh?

03:21.167 --> 03:24.068
ho! Okay.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.017
<i>As the years went by...</i>

03:42.121 --> 03:45.579
<i>a new love brought me closer to my father...</i>

03:45.692 --> 03:48.957
<i>the art of Wushu.</i>

03:54.767 --> 03:57.531
<i>he was very proud.</i>

04:08.715 --> 04:11.183
<i>Growing up was liKe a dream.</i>

04:14.287 --> 04:16.778
<i>But nothing lasts forever.</i>

04:21.226 --> 04:23.889
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

04:56.496 --> 04:57.986
<i>Balrog.!</i>

06:20.380 --> 06:23.372
<i>- papa.! papa.!
- Chun-Li.!</i>

06:23.483 --> 06:25.951
- Where you going?
- Get off me!

06:26.052 --> 06:28.919
- Let her go.
- Let me go!

06:30.356 --> 06:33.257
I love what you've done to your new place.

06:33.359 --> 06:36.624
<i>Next time you move, tell me...
I'll bring you a housewarming gift.</i>

06:36.729 --> 06:38.890
Papa!

06:38.998 --> 06:43.435
- Let me go!
- Well, well, Balrog. It seems we have a wild one here.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.299
Let her go, Bison.

06:53.012 --> 06:56.846
Shh. It's okay, my sweet.

06:56.949 --> 07:00.612
A gentleman would never harm a schoolgirl.

07:03.122 --> 07:04.919
Go.

07:11.798 --> 07:13.459
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

07:15.435 --> 07:17.300
Night-night.

07:17.403 --> 07:19.098
<i>Balrog.</i>

07:26.245 --> 07:29.009
Chun-Li!

07:29.115 --> 07:32.278
<i>No.!</i>

07:32.385 --> 07:34.615
hey! You leave her alone!

07:39.091 --> 07:41.286
Get in there!

09:40.580 --> 09:42.980
Thank you very much.

09:46.619 --> 09:50.316
Now I remember why no one wanted to play
with you atJuilliard.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.654
- Aren't you so sweet.
- I'm serious.

09:53.759 --> 09:57.092
You always get the flowers.

09:57.196 --> 10:00.097
So how's your mom? Did she come?

10:00.199 --> 10:03.600
<i>- No. She's not doing very well.
- Oh.</i>

10:03.703 --> 10:05.762
I'm so sorry.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.375
Oh! I almost forgot.

10:10.476 --> 10:13.001
- This came for you.
- Who's it from?

10:13.112 --> 10:16.138
I don't know. An admirer maybe?

10:27.393 --> 10:29.793
I wonder what it says.

10:29.895 --> 10:31.795
Wow!

10:31.897 --> 10:34.661
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, it is.

10:41.841 --> 10:45.299
<i>So, after the concert,
I finally gave him my phone number.</i>

10:45.411 --> 10:47.470
I don't know if he'll call but...

10:47.580 --> 10:50.879
- You sure you don't want a ride?
- I'm okay. I like taking the subway.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.575
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay. Okay.

10:52.685 --> 10:54.585
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.996
<i>The crime rate continues to rise...</i>

11:39.098 --> 11:40.998
<i>in several slum districts
throughout Southeast Asia.</i>

11:41.100 --> 11:44.092
<i>No single group has been identified
for this new wave of violence.</i>

11:44.203 --> 11:46.103
<i>Authorities instead suggest an overlap...</i>

11:46.205 --> 11:48.469
Chun-Li?

11:57.316 --> 11:59.716
Why did you take off your concert dress?

11:59.819 --> 12:02.253
I couldn't wear it all the way home.

12:02.354 --> 12:04.914
<i>I wanted to see you in it.</i>

12:05.024 --> 12:07.288
And I'll bet you took the subway again, huh?

12:07.393 --> 12:10.260
<i>It's dangerous out there, sweetie.</i>

12:10.362 --> 12:12.728
Mama...

12:12.832 --> 12:14.732
we can't just change our lives...

12:14.834 --> 12:17.394
every time the news tells us so.

12:17.503 --> 12:20.472
<i>Just liKe your father.</i>

12:20.573 --> 12:24.339
Always standing up when standing's not easy.

12:40.793 --> 12:43.956
<i>Gentlemen, thanKyou for coming.</i>

12:44.063 --> 12:47.794
<i>As the distinguished leaders
of the Shadaloo Investment Corporation...</i>

12:47.900 --> 12:49.800
You're all very important men.

12:49.902 --> 12:52.029
And I don't mean to waste your time.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.834
So, a toast.

12:54.940 --> 12:59.138
Over the years our networks
have been very useful for each other.

12:59.245 --> 13:02.078
We've all been well compensated for it.

13:02.181 --> 13:07.278
Unfortunately for you,
that compensation is about to come to an end.

13:07.386 --> 13:11.345
<i>I'm taKing over Shadaloo
and moving my interests...</i>

13:11.457 --> 13:13.357
into Bangkok.

13:13.459 --> 13:17.190
Now, I understand that many of these
territories overlap with neighborhoods...

13:17.296 --> 13:19.890
that, at this moment,
You consider to be your own.

13:19.999 --> 13:22.797
This is no longer true.

13:22.902 --> 13:26.565
The sooner you accept this,
the better it'll be.

13:34.146 --> 13:37.343
<i>Show your loyalty to me right now...</i>

13:37.449 --> 13:40.282
and we'll have no problems.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.354
Slainte.

13:54.567 --> 13:58.025
Gentlemen, thank you for your time.

14:08.547 --> 14:11.710
- Nobody talks to me like that.
- Who the hell does he think he is?

14:11.817 --> 14:13.717
That pig.

14:23.629 --> 14:26.962
Mmm. Mmm-mm.

14:41.413 --> 14:43.313
This just came in.

15:28.724 --> 15:30.954
Gangland homicide?

15:37.900 --> 15:40.266
<i>I love this job.</i>

15:43.972 --> 15:45.439
You're the Interpol man?

15:45.541 --> 15:47.941
Yeah. Call me Nash.

15:48.043 --> 15:50.102
Maya Sunee, Bangkok G.h.

15:50.212 --> 15:52.305
New Year's come early?

15:52.414 --> 15:55.645
We got a tip at 6:00 this morning.
Someone wanted us to know this was here.

15:55.751 --> 15:57.651
heads of every crime family.

15:57.753 --> 16:00.187
<i>Signed, sealed and delivered.</i>

16:00.289 --> 16:02.223
<i>Yeah, Last Supper.</i>

16:02.324 --> 16:05.316
And he serves 'em their own heads.

16:05.427 --> 16:08.419
"he"?

16:08.530 --> 16:11.363
Tell me something I don't know, Nash.

16:12.468 --> 16:15.232
You just inherited a big problem.

16:20.392 --> 16:22.360
Good morning.

16:24.863 --> 16:26.763
Or is it evening?

16:27.933 --> 16:29.958
She had a piano concert.

16:30.068 --> 16:32.628
From what I've heard,
she was quite well received.

16:35.974 --> 16:38.499
You know, I'm surprised you chose
the landscape setting.

16:38.610 --> 16:42.569
<i>I'd have thought of you
as being much more of a big city man.</i>

16:44.549 --> 16:47.245
A prison is a prison, Bison.

16:47.352 --> 16:50.412
No matter what's outside.

16:50.522 --> 16:53.082
Show a prisoner the world, and all he sees...

16:53.191 --> 16:55.716
are the bars on the window.

16:55.827 --> 16:59.126
You needn't be so cynical.

17:01.032 --> 17:03.660
<i>Ahhh. home, sweet home.</i>

17:03.768 --> 17:07.363
- Gorgeous, isn't it?
- So how'd your meeting go?

17:07.472 --> 17:10.099
Very well. Thank you for asking.

17:10.208 --> 17:14.736
I'm officially the only surviving
partner of Shadaloo.

17:18.183 --> 17:20.674
Now we move on to
the Bangkok board of directors.

17:20.785 --> 17:23.252
I'll need their contacts for that.

17:25.323 --> 17:28.952
Killing them isn't gonna
get you anywhere, Bison.

17:29.060 --> 17:31.392
I'm not interested in the board.

17:33.064 --> 17:35.294
I'm interested in their families.

17:46.044 --> 17:48.308
Damn you!

17:48.413 --> 17:53.350
Get him more pictures of the girl,
something more upbeat this time.

17:53.451 --> 17:57.751
It's amazing what a man will do
just to see his daughter.

17:57.856 --> 18:00.256
There's one thing I learned in the slums...

18:00.358 --> 18:04.158
When people are hungry,
there's nothing they won't do.

18:14.806 --> 18:16.933
Everyone has a price.

19:21.139 --> 19:25.075
<i>With my mother gone,
the path in front of me was empty.</i>

19:26.711 --> 19:30.272
<i>I couldn't help feeling
liKe I was being led somewhere new.</i>

19:33.618 --> 19:36.883
<i>Was this mysterious scroll a message?</i>

19:36.988 --> 19:39.218
<i>Who was it from?</i>

19:39.324 --> 19:41.224
<i>I had to find out.</i>

21:55.593 --> 21:57.652
Crashing our party?

21:57.762 --> 22:00.253
Get used to it.
We're your new roommates.

22:00.365 --> 22:02.265
<i>Who says we need any?</i>

22:02.367 --> 22:04.426
<i>I've spent the last three years of my life...</i>

22:04.536 --> 22:07.266
chasin' around an organization
called Shadaloo.

22:07.372 --> 22:12.503
- Shadaloo's a myth.
- I wouldn't be in this ashtray if it was.

22:12.610 --> 22:15.135
Those bodies piled up in the harbor...

22:15.246 --> 22:17.612
they were the heads of the ruling
crime families of Bangkok, correct?

22:17.715 --> 22:19.239
<i>- Yes.
- Uh-huh. Right?</i>

22:19.350 --> 22:22.751
And now they're all dead except for one.

22:24.556 --> 22:27.753
his name's Bison...

22:27.859 --> 22:32.228
and I've tracked him through 11 major cities
on four continents and never come close.

22:32.330 --> 22:34.230
Not once.

22:34.332 --> 22:37.165
This guy walks through the raindrops.

22:37.268 --> 22:42.228
And anybody that's against him
is either dead or on their way.

22:42.340 --> 22:44.535
Now he's the last man standing.

22:49.714 --> 22:52.547
So, where do we start?

22:52.650 --> 22:55.915
You don't want a ticket
to this dance, Detective.

22:57.655 --> 23:00.249
You've never even seen me dance.

23:06.464 --> 23:08.864
<i>To find Gen...</i>

23:08.967 --> 23:13.131
<i>I was told I had to leave behind
the life I Knew...</i>

23:13.238 --> 23:15.138
<i>even my home...</i>

23:15.240 --> 23:18.368
<i>and all the memories that were so dear to me.</i>

24:17.335 --> 24:19.326
<i>As it was written in the scroll...</i>

24:19.437 --> 24:23.373
<i>I had to forget everything I used to be.</i>

24:23.474 --> 24:27.308
<i>I had to lose myself
to the pulse of the streets.</i>

24:28.513 --> 24:32.677
<i>I had to become one
with the people of BangKoK.</i>

25:23.101 --> 25:25.729
<i>This was all so new to me.</i>

25:26.904 --> 25:30.203
<i>Life was hard on these streets.</i>

25:30.308 --> 25:32.640
<i>Every night was a struggle.</i>

25:34.412 --> 25:37.006
<i>Every meal was a gift.</i>

25:53.931 --> 25:57.526
<i>Day after day, I searched for Gen.</i>

26:00.438 --> 26:05.341
<i>As time went by,
I was getting further and further away...</i>

26:05.443 --> 26:07.570
<i>from all that I ever was.</i>

26:09.781 --> 26:11.874
<i>I felt lost...</i>

26:11.983 --> 26:14.611
<i>chasing a ghost I might never find.</i>

26:30.701 --> 26:33.033
<i>But what I found...</i>

26:33.137 --> 26:35.697
<i>I wasn't prepared for.</i>

26:35.807 --> 26:37.775
<i>Everywhere I looKed...</i>

26:37.875 --> 26:40.901
<i>there was crime without punishment.</i>

26:42.313 --> 26:44.213
<i>I wanted to do something.</i>

26:46.017 --> 26:47.609
<i>Anything.</i>

26:47.718 --> 26:50.846
<i>I just didn't Know where to begin.</i>

27:05.269 --> 27:07.396
<i>Who could protect these people?</i>

27:08.706 --> 27:10.867
<i>Who was oppressing them?</i>

27:23.955 --> 27:26.287
Fantastic, isn't it?

27:26.390 --> 27:29.826
All these waterfront slums
will soon belong to Shadaloo.

27:29.927 --> 27:33.863
Location, location, location.

27:33.965 --> 27:36.832
This came in from Murmansk.
I think you're gonna like it.

27:38.769 --> 27:40.669
<i>It's the White Rose.</i>

27:42.440 --> 27:45.238
how long has it been? Fifteen years?

27:46.878 --> 27:48.903
Seventeen years...

27:49.013 --> 27:51.948
four months and six days.

27:54.285 --> 27:58.654
Bring the package to Bangkok... safely.

27:58.756 --> 28:00.951
There is no room for error.

28:01.058 --> 28:03.492
I got some bad news too.

28:03.594 --> 28:06.324
The schoolgirl's gone.

28:06.430 --> 28:10.696
<i>We thinKshe's in BangKoK.
But don't worry. We'll find her.</i>

28:45.036 --> 28:47.004
hey!

29:03.754 --> 29:05.915
hey!

29:06.023 --> 29:09.083
Leave him alone.

29:10.194 --> 29:12.856
It's none of your business, baby.

30:51.762 --> 30:55.323
Where you go, trouble follows.

30:59.904 --> 31:04.364
My name is Gen. Don't worry, Chun-Li.

31:04.475 --> 31:08.377
- how do you know who I am?
- We've been watching you for some time.

31:08.479 --> 31:11.073
I know who took your father.

31:11.182 --> 31:14.447
he's alive? Where is he?

31:14.552 --> 31:17.043
<i>- I'll tell you when you're ready.
- Ready for what?</i>

31:17.154 --> 31:19.452
<i>Ready to put away your anger.</i>

31:19.557 --> 31:23.118
<i>You are the only one who can bring
your father bacK, and I can help you do it.</i>

31:23.227 --> 31:26.025
But you have to do it my way.

31:26.130 --> 31:28.121
Just tell me where he is.

31:28.232 --> 31:30.860
You don't know what you're up against.

31:30.968 --> 31:32.868
Let me show you.

31:39.610 --> 31:42.443
<i>These are the slums.</i>

31:42.546 --> 31:44.480
<i>The people are suffering.</i>

31:44.582 --> 31:47.983
<i>The streets are being taKen over
by a criminal organization...</i>

31:48.085 --> 31:49.985
called Shadaloo.

31:50.087 --> 31:52.419
I used to be a part of'em.

31:52.523 --> 31:56.721
When you fight on the side of monsters,
eventually you become one yourself.

31:56.827 --> 32:00.319
That's why I changed, saw the better way.

32:01.365 --> 32:02.832
The Order of the Web.

32:06.203 --> 32:08.603
I created the Order to fight injustice...

32:08.706 --> 32:11.197
<i>to protect the people
who can't fight for themselves.</i>

32:11.308 --> 32:15.267
- What does this have to do with my father?
- Everything.

32:15.379 --> 32:17.870
Your father was a very
well-connected businessman.

32:17.982 --> 32:21.349
his relationships could open any doors
in any country anywhere.

32:21.452 --> 32:23.943
Many people wanted those connections.

32:24.054 --> 32:27.751
People like Bison, the leader of Shadaloo.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.053
My father would never help someone like that.

32:32.163 --> 32:35.132
No? Not even for the safety
of his only daughter?

32:37.234 --> 32:40.692
- What do you want from me?
- I'm giving you a chance to join us...

32:40.805 --> 32:43.968
to become part of the Web, to fight
for something far greater than yourself.

32:44.074 --> 32:47.043
I already know how to fight.

33:01.358 --> 33:02.950
Impress me.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.600
Anger isn't gonna guide you.

33:11.702 --> 33:13.397
Trust me. I know.

33:24.949 --> 33:27.417
- Why are you mad right now?
- Because you're hurting me.

33:31.355 --> 33:34.381
No. You're hurting yourself.

33:43.901 --> 33:45.596
You fight with passion...

33:46.704 --> 33:49.366
but your anger distorts your judgment.

33:52.309 --> 33:54.334
Bison will see right through you.

34:30.514 --> 34:32.744
<i>Believe in your true self.</i>

34:33.851 --> 34:36.217
Look for an innocence beyond the anger.

34:42.559 --> 34:44.527
You still got a long way to go.

34:48.565 --> 34:51.966
<i>Bison, the same man who tooKmy father...</i>

34:52.069 --> 34:54.036
<i>was here in BangKoK.</i>

34:55.139 --> 34:57.573
<i>I'd never been so close...</i>

34:57.675 --> 35:00.473
<i>and so far away.</i>

35:00.577 --> 35:03.705
<i>I had to research his organization.</i>

35:03.814 --> 35:07.272
<i>I had to find out about Shadaloo.</i>

35:34.278 --> 35:37.247
<i>I must congratulate you all, gentlemen.</i>

35:37.348 --> 35:40.909
You've shown remarkably sound judgment.

35:41.018 --> 35:44.249
Not many municipal governments
would take such a bold stand...

35:44.355 --> 35:48.348
against the criminal elements
of their own population.

35:48.459 --> 35:51.792
People will point to you
long after your time has passed.

35:53.163 --> 35:56.655
<i>And here's the best part...
your debts are now clean.</i>

36:00.771 --> 36:03.137
<i>What about our families?</i>

36:03.240 --> 36:05.401
Your children have been returned.

36:07.878 --> 36:11.837
Mr. Bison thanks you
for your continuing support.

36:31.468 --> 36:34.460
The papers are signed.
The slums are in your hands.

36:34.571 --> 36:38.769
Good girl, Cantana.
I'll handle the Secretary of Commerce.

36:38.876 --> 36:42.437
Looks like somebody's about to own
the Ministry of Commerce.

36:42.546 --> 36:45.276
<i>Nash, I have a source at the port authority.</i>

36:45.382 --> 36:49.648
he said the state just sold the majority share
of the slums to Esperanto Security Company.

36:49.753 --> 36:52.017
<i>Everything from the harbor to the marKets.</i>

36:53.724 --> 36:55.658
Of course. It's a front for Shadaloo.

36:55.759 --> 36:59.286
<i>Bison's bringing crime into the neighborhoods
to drive the land value down.</i>

36:59.396 --> 37:02.593
And then he's buying it back up wholesale.

37:02.699 --> 37:06.135
- We gotta move on then.
- Okay, we're on it. Come with me.

38:07.664 --> 38:09.791
Isn't this your old neighborhood?

38:09.900 --> 38:12.095
Old and new.

38:12.202 --> 38:14.727
home, sweet home.

38:14.838 --> 38:17.238
I'm such a sentimental guy
that I invested in this shit hole.

38:17.341 --> 38:19.901
Though I have to admit,
I got a very nice deal on it.

38:20.010 --> 38:21.978
It doesn't look like a nice deal for them.

38:22.079 --> 38:24.070
<i>And I thinK they want it bacK.</i>

38:24.181 --> 38:26.081
Too late for that.

38:26.183 --> 38:28.276
Bulldozers come in tomorrow.
And soon after...

38:28.385 --> 38:32.253
beautiful homes for those who can afford it.

38:32.356 --> 38:34.256
I'm making Bangkok a better place.

38:34.358 --> 38:37.885
- They should build me a temple for that.
- Mmm.

38:50.174 --> 38:53.405
<i>Life's about choices, Balrog.</i>

38:53.510 --> 38:56.570
<i>I was about his age when I made mine.</i>

38:56.680 --> 38:58.944
<i>And I've never looked back.</i>

39:07.991 --> 39:10.892
<i>hey, Maya?
I love staKeouts as much as the next guy...</i>

39:10.994 --> 39:12.894
<i>but what the hell are we doing here?</i>

39:12.996 --> 39:14.896
<i>Well, our source says Bison's guy...</i>

39:14.998 --> 39:17.125
<i>should be leaving
for the meet any second now.</i>

39:20.137 --> 39:22.298
Are you sure we're in the right place?

39:22.406 --> 39:25.307
No, I just like the view.

39:26.710 --> 39:29.201
Wait. There he is.

39:30.314 --> 39:32.942
Come here.

40:05.882 --> 40:08.180
- That had to be done.
- Yeah, it had to.

40:10.487 --> 40:13.650
<i>There goes the Benz.</i>

40:13.757 --> 40:16.089
<i>Just maKe sure you don't lose him, Romeo.</i>

40:16.193 --> 40:18.093
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

40:19.930 --> 40:25.596
Why are we meeting here? We handed over
the slums. What more do you want?

40:25.702 --> 40:28.671
There's a package coming in
on a ship from Murmansk.

40:28.772 --> 40:31.969
We need safe passage and no damn customs.

40:32.075 --> 40:34.339
You're the commerce secretary.

40:34.444 --> 40:37.311
So make it happen.

40:37.414 --> 40:40.406
- I need details.
- It's on the shipping manifest.

40:40.517 --> 40:43.543
<i>The package is called the White Rose.</i>

40:51.828 --> 40:55.093
Only in the dark do all colors become one.

40:55.198 --> 40:58.258
You can't just cope with the darkness...

40:58.368 --> 41:01.860
You have to embrace what is without fear.

41:02.906 --> 41:05.534
You have to feel without your senses.

41:05.642 --> 41:08.577
harness the energy around you.

42:10.240 --> 42:13.141
Well done. Let's eat.

42:15.879 --> 42:19.406
<i>Yo, Maya. You almost done in there?</i>

42:20.951 --> 42:23.977
<i>hey, it's not my fault you got here early.</i>

42:27.624 --> 42:30.092
So we're going clubbing tonight.

42:30.193 --> 42:33.185
Bison's attache loves
hittin' the nightlife...

42:33.296 --> 42:35.787
and I want to see what she's up to.

42:35.899 --> 42:38.424
Always work with you.

42:38.535 --> 42:42.699
You know, Nash,
if what you say about Bison is true...

42:42.806 --> 42:46.401
waiting and watching his bitch
is not gonna be the way we bring him down.

42:48.145 --> 42:50.045
We should be more aggressive.

42:50.147 --> 42:53.082
Looks like you got that down.

42:55.185 --> 42:58.245
Well, unlike you, I don't lose my man.

42:58.355 --> 43:02.348
And besides,
there's nothing I won't try once.

43:18.809 --> 43:21.175
Do you have any cash? I'm thirsty.

43:21.278 --> 43:24.736
- Are you serious?
- I don't have any money.

43:26.183 --> 43:28.777
You should try hocking those gold handcuffs.

44:01.585 --> 44:04.110
To the boys who have got my back.

44:04.221 --> 44:07.213
Tonight, I've got my own. Enjoy.

46:51.988 --> 46:54.582
Thought I might ask you a few questions.

47:27.724 --> 47:29.749
<i>Tell me about the White Rose.</i>

47:29.859 --> 47:32.692
You must be Daddy's little girl.

47:35.832 --> 47:37.732
Out of order, ladies.

47:43.473 --> 47:45.839
- Cantana.
- I know who your boss is.

47:51.748 --> 47:53.648
- Tell me.
- It's a shipment.

47:53.750 --> 47:55.911
Arrives at the end of the month...
the last Friday.

47:56.019 --> 47:59.216
<i>- Where?
- Central Shipyard, Berth 21.</i>

48:01.891 --> 48:05.622
<i>I want you to send Bison a message.</i>

48:05.729 --> 48:09.165
Tell him the schoolgirl's grown up.

48:09.265 --> 48:11.290
<i>This is it.</i>

48:14.104 --> 48:16.732
Nash... Nash, something's going down.

48:37.460 --> 48:39.189
<i>hey.!</i>

49:07.023 --> 49:09.457
<i>Interpol.! Freeze.! Stay down.</i>

49:35.385 --> 49:40.152
Are you gonna tell me, or should I guess?

49:40.256 --> 49:42.224
Go ahead and guess.

50:16.539 --> 50:19.064
That is one tough cookie.

50:19.175 --> 50:21.735
She most certainly was.

50:24.079 --> 50:26.274
But she'd said enough.

50:26.382 --> 50:28.441
The damage was done.

50:28.551 --> 50:30.519
You think we gotta change the plans?

50:31.820 --> 50:36.780
Unfortunately, we do.
Get the insurance policy.

50:36.892 --> 50:38.860
Call Vega.

50:47.303 --> 50:49.294
You broke my heart.

51:07.790 --> 51:10.554
<i>- I don't know. Maybe she's an angry stripper.
- Yeah.</i>

51:10.659 --> 51:14.720
An irate pole dancer
not happy with her tips...

51:14.830 --> 51:16.730
sets off Armageddon.

51:16.832 --> 51:21.792
<i>- Keep spitballing that, Maya. I love where your head's at.
- All right, Nash.</i>

51:21.904 --> 51:23.804
What do you think it is?

51:23.906 --> 51:28.673
This girl just wiped the floor with some
of the most dangerous players in Bangkok...

51:28.777 --> 51:31.905
and then bails out like
she's got a plane to catch.

51:32.014 --> 51:35.575
She's making a statement.
Now, come on, fellas. Who is this girl?

51:35.684 --> 51:39.711
Does she have priors?
A paper trail? how about a name?

51:39.822 --> 51:42.791
We checked the archives.
Nash, she's off the radar.

51:44.026 --> 51:46.995
We can look at
the closed-circuit security feed.

51:47.096 --> 51:49.530
The front door has a good shot.

51:59.174 --> 52:01.438
hey, thanks.

52:15.391 --> 52:17.359
Mmm-mm.

52:22.097 --> 52:24.258
how's aggressive workin' for ya?

52:24.366 --> 52:26.732
Shut up.

52:26.835 --> 52:30.202
<i>- No one's talking.
- No, they won't.</i>

52:30.306 --> 52:32.797
They're protecting her.

52:34.376 --> 52:36.708
You're right.

52:49.224 --> 52:52.751
- home-cooked.
- Tell me about Bison.

52:57.032 --> 53:00.490
We grew up together.
Like me, he was a criminal...

53:00.602 --> 53:02.661
with no future.

53:02.771 --> 53:04.671
his parents were Irish missionaries...

53:04.773 --> 53:06.832
who died in Thailand when he was very young.

53:09.678 --> 53:12.511
<i>Soon, the boy became very ill.</i>

53:12.614 --> 53:17.051
<i>Where he was, no one cared about the sicK.</i>

53:17.152 --> 53:20.417
<i>So they left him... to die.</i>

53:22.191 --> 53:24.751
<i>But the child survived.</i>

53:27.363 --> 53:29.490
<i>With each passing year...</i>

53:29.598 --> 53:31.896
<i>he became more and more feared...</i>

53:32.000 --> 53:34.696
<i>and a well-Known thief on the streets.</i>

53:36.605 --> 53:39.597
<i>he tooK what he wanted when he wanted it.</i>

53:39.708 --> 53:43.769
<i>But even that wasn't enough.</i>

53:43.879 --> 53:45.676
<i>he yearned for more.</i>

53:50.319 --> 53:54.415
<i>So he went to the darKcaves
in the phang Nga Bay...</i>

53:54.523 --> 53:57.253
<i>and brought his new wife.</i>

54:04.166 --> 54:06.225
<i>From ancient tales...</i>

54:06.335 --> 54:09.065
<i>he'd heard about the darKforces...</i>

54:09.171 --> 54:11.162
<i>that could free a man from his conscience.</i>

54:38.300 --> 54:42.498
<i>he had to transfer
the goodness ofhis soul...</i>

54:42.604 --> 54:45.334
<i>into his unborn daughter.</i>

55:20.909 --> 55:23.810
<i>The transformation was complete.</i>

55:25.547 --> 55:29.039
<i>he had finally rid himself ofhis conscience.</i>

55:35.591 --> 55:37.582
Now he's home again...

55:37.693 --> 55:40.821
Bangkok, where it all started.

55:40.929 --> 55:44.262
he's making moves on a bigger scale
than I've ever seen before.

55:44.366 --> 55:47.529
Sounds like the perfect time
to take him down and bring my father back.

55:48.837 --> 55:51.965
how's your wrist?

55:52.074 --> 55:54.304
- It's better.
- Good.

55:54.409 --> 55:56.707
You're doing well.

55:58.914 --> 56:01.041
Chun-Li.

56:01.149 --> 56:03.083
I've got an important task for you.

56:03.185 --> 56:05.983
Maybe the hardest thing
I'll ever ask you to do.

56:06.088 --> 56:07.988
I want you to go buy groceries for breakfast.

56:08.090 --> 56:12.049
Pawning off all the hard work?

56:12.160 --> 56:14.253
That's the privilege of a teacher.

56:27.109 --> 56:29.509
<i>Get the R.P.G.</i>

56:59.156 --> 57:00.350
Fire the missile!

57:02.627 --> 57:06.825
Give me that! I'll do it myself.

57:16.507 --> 57:19.408
Say good night, baby.

57:26.117 --> 57:28.608
Let's go.

58:10.695 --> 58:15.189
<i>I called you because
you do my best dirty worK.</i>

58:15.299 --> 58:19.065
Something very important
to me is about to arrive in Bangkok.

58:20.571 --> 58:23.199
And I don't want anything to
interfere with it.

58:24.542 --> 58:27.477
There is a schoolgirl
that needs taking care of.

58:27.578 --> 58:30.342
<i>What Kind of schoolgirl are we talKing about?</i>

58:30.448 --> 58:33.542
She is a problem child.

58:39.657 --> 58:41.750
Well, well, well.

58:41.859 --> 58:44.726
She'll never be a problem again.

58:59.043 --> 59:01.307
<i>You've got ghosts. Let's see 'em.</i>

59:07.718 --> 59:09.845
Chun-Li.

01:00:23.894 --> 01:00:25.828
huh?

01:01:05.236 --> 01:01:08.467
No wonder you wear a mask.

01:01:08.572 --> 01:01:11.268
I'd hide that face too.

01:01:17.147 --> 01:01:19.581
You bitch!

01:01:19.683 --> 01:01:21.651
I'll cut you open!

01:01:23.587 --> 01:01:26.385
You think this is over?

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:28.424
No. I'm just getting started.

01:01:49.246 --> 01:01:51.646
This is a restricted area.

01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:55.116
I thought you might make an exception.

01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:01.690
I have a question for you.

01:02:01.792 --> 01:02:05.660
A shipment was scheduled
to arrive at Berth 21 in two days.

01:02:06.897 --> 01:02:10.526
Listen, lady,
I think it's time for you to go.

01:02:14.738 --> 01:02:17.673
<i>They call it bai mei... the White Rose.</i>

01:02:17.775 --> 01:02:19.470
What time does it arrive?

01:02:19.577 --> 01:02:22.307
Midnight.

01:02:22.413 --> 01:02:24.847
You should learn some manners.

01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:27.247
Never put your hands on a lady.

01:02:39.063 --> 01:02:42.123
Forget to pay the rent? Where is everybody?

01:02:42.232 --> 01:02:45.292
Orders from up high. We're off the case.

01:02:45.402 --> 01:02:47.302
What orders?

01:02:47.404 --> 01:02:49.702
Orders, Nash.

01:02:49.807 --> 01:02:51.741
You were right.

01:02:51.842 --> 01:02:53.742
Shadaloo is very well connected.

01:02:55.679 --> 01:02:58.910
- We're out.
- hey, wait a minute. Maya.

01:02:59.016 --> 01:03:01.177
That's it?

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.313
I'm sorry, Charlie.

01:04:22.866 --> 01:04:27.667
You're not a schoolgirl anymore.

01:04:30.574 --> 01:04:32.542
Bring her in.

01:04:42.119 --> 01:04:44.087
<i>Oh.</i>

01:04:49.126 --> 01:04:52.323
So this is the girl that roughed up Vega?

01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:56.021
<i>I liKe her already.</i>

01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:02.270
huang!

01:05:05.509 --> 01:05:07.477
Let me go!

01:05:13.283 --> 01:05:15.649
<i>papa.</i>

01:05:15.753 --> 01:05:18.881
<i>You two taKe some time and catch up.</i>

01:05:24.995 --> 01:05:26.826
Chun-Li.

01:05:29.433 --> 01:05:31.401
Why?

01:05:33.337 --> 01:05:35.362
Papa, I had to.

01:05:36.507 --> 01:05:39.704
You know I tried so hard for so many years...

01:05:41.478 --> 01:05:43.844
just to keep you safe...

01:05:45.182 --> 01:05:46.740
to protect you...

01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:48.750
to make sure you had the good life.

01:05:48.852 --> 01:05:51.377
I would rather have you.

01:05:53.290 --> 01:05:57.886
Getting in Bison's way, it's a losing battle.

01:05:57.995 --> 01:06:00.589
Why are you doing this to yourself?

01:06:00.697 --> 01:06:03.165
Sometimes, you have to stand up...

01:06:03.267 --> 01:06:05.235
when standing isn't easy.

01:06:05.335 --> 01:06:09.169
- You taught me that.
- I love you so much.

01:06:09.273 --> 01:06:12.333
I love you.

01:06:19.983 --> 01:06:24.215
I love family reunions.

01:06:24.321 --> 01:06:26.346
Don't touch her.

01:06:27.758 --> 01:06:30.784
If you touch her again,
You get nothing more from me.

01:06:30.894 --> 01:06:34.625
- Do you understand?
- Oh, I understand.

01:06:34.731 --> 01:06:38.292
You see,
Your father has been the milk of my business.

01:06:42.139 --> 01:06:44.039
But even milk...

01:06:44.141 --> 01:06:46.200
has an expiration date.

01:06:47.978 --> 01:06:50.446
- No. No, don't.
- I'm a man of my word.

01:06:50.547 --> 01:06:53.948
- No, please! - I promised him
he'd have a chance to say good-bye.

01:06:54.051 --> 01:06:57.714
<i>No! No! No, please, stop!</i>

01:06:57.821 --> 01:07:00.221
No!

01:07:07.197 --> 01:07:12.100
You... will not stop me.

01:07:19.776 --> 01:07:22.540
<i>TaKe the body away.</i>

01:07:22.646 --> 01:07:24.614
Balrog.

01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:37.624
Is there anything you wanna say before
we get this over with?

01:07:41.531 --> 01:07:43.499
<i>All right.</i>

01:07:44.534 --> 01:07:46.365
And make it quick.

01:07:55.312 --> 01:07:58.213
Should we kill you
before or after we cut you?

01:07:58.315 --> 01:08:00.112
I wouldn't do either.

01:08:00.217 --> 01:08:02.447
- You're not in a place to negotiate.
- Not yet.

01:08:54.805 --> 01:08:57.171
Swing around the block.

01:10:01.371 --> 01:10:04.306
Ow!

01:10:04.408 --> 01:10:07.309
<i>Somebody got a problem?</i>

01:10:11.415 --> 01:10:14.111
Come on! Come on! Let's go!

01:10:51.221 --> 01:10:53.655
You're alive.

01:10:53.757 --> 01:10:55.725
Come on.

01:11:15.479 --> 01:11:17.640
<i>Gen.</i>

01:11:26.022 --> 01:11:28.650
Where you go...

01:11:28.758 --> 01:11:31.158
trouble certainly does follow.

01:11:32.496 --> 01:11:34.487
Let me see this.

01:11:41.538 --> 01:11:43.768
hmm. Let's fix it.

01:11:43.874 --> 01:11:46.069
Come.

01:12:42.032 --> 01:12:45.024
Pretty soon,
You're not gonna need me anymore.

01:12:46.403 --> 01:12:49.566
<i>Now, let's find the White Rose.</i>

01:12:56.246 --> 01:12:58.771
how's your arm doing?

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:04.062
I'm sorry. They made me do it.

01:13:04.169 --> 01:13:07.070
Do you remember my question,
or do I have to ask you again?

01:13:08.674 --> 01:13:11.802
Tomorrow night, a ship from Murmansk...

01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:13.901
will arrive in the front berth.

01:13:14.012 --> 01:13:16.071
You wouldn't set me up twice now, would you?

01:13:16.181 --> 01:13:18.911
Please. Look.

01:13:19.017 --> 01:13:21.008
It's right here. See?

01:13:23.588 --> 01:13:25.488
Thank you.

01:13:53.085 --> 01:13:56.851
<i>Sorry for interrupting.</i>

01:13:56.955 --> 01:13:58.980
<i>No problem.</i>

01:13:59.091 --> 01:14:01.685
hi.

01:14:01.793 --> 01:14:04.728
What can I do for ya?

01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:07.799
Bison's shipment arrives
at Central harbor tomorrow night.

01:14:07.899 --> 01:14:10.026
And?

01:14:10.135 --> 01:14:12.103
I'm gonna need backup.

01:14:16.575 --> 01:14:19.601
<i>Unit three's holding. Got it.</i>

01:14:20.979 --> 01:14:23.470
<i>ChecK the ammo.</i>

01:14:23.582 --> 01:14:25.482
Good. We're good to go.

01:14:25.584 --> 01:14:28.519
<i>All right, Bison, where the hell are you?</i>

01:14:31.823 --> 01:14:34.986
- We've got guests, fellas.
- We're set.

01:14:58.817 --> 01:15:01.411
I thought you were out.

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:03.420
We all grew up in this neighborhood.

01:15:03.522 --> 01:15:06.184
Don't wanna see it disappear.

01:15:15.734 --> 01:15:18.703
<i>LooKs liKe they're expecting us.</i>

01:15:31.983 --> 01:15:33.883
We are not alone.

01:15:33.985 --> 01:15:36.920
It makes no difference. We're ready.

01:15:43.495 --> 01:15:47.261
Bomb! Everybody out! Go! Go!

01:15:47.365 --> 01:15:49.993
Go! Go! Go!

01:16:31.877 --> 01:16:33.936
Nash!

01:16:39.217 --> 01:16:41.708
- Stay low!
- Come on! Come on!

01:16:42.787 --> 01:16:44.880
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:17:29.301 --> 01:17:30.131
Are you okay?

01:17:33.104 --> 01:17:35.129
Okay. Just stay here.

01:17:56.795 --> 01:18:01.289
You know,
You're a lot slower than you used to be.

01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:20.711
And you're just as ugly as I remember!

01:18:20.819 --> 01:18:23.151
<i>Where's the White Rose?</i>

01:18:51.583 --> 01:18:53.949
<i>You don't even know what the White Rose is!</i>

01:18:54.052 --> 01:18:56.850
By the time you fools figure it out,
she'll be long gone.

01:18:56.955 --> 01:18:59.253
"She"?

01:19:14.706 --> 01:19:18.198
You two stay with her! You, come with me!

01:19:36.227 --> 01:19:38.889
<i>That's Bison.</i>

01:19:38.997 --> 01:19:41.397
Give me a fix on the helicopter
leaving my location.

01:19:41.499 --> 01:19:44.297
Nash, out.

01:20:05.023 --> 01:20:06.991
<i>Gen.!</i>

01:20:08.093 --> 01:20:11.529
<i>The White Rose...
not a weapon. A girl.</i>

01:20:11.629 --> 01:20:15.065
A girl? I just saw her.

01:20:15.166 --> 01:20:17.600
Bison's daughter was
the conduit for his soul.

01:20:19.537 --> 01:20:22.836
<i>- he rid himself ofhis goodness
by passing it into her.</i>

01:20:22.941 --> 01:20:25.842
<i>And she is his only weaKness.</i>

01:20:25.944 --> 01:20:28.572
That's why he's been
looking for her all this time.

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:31.274
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.

01:20:31.382 --> 01:20:33.543
And I'm gonna need support when we get there!

01:20:33.651 --> 01:20:36.552
Don't keep me waiting! Nash, out!

01:20:37.622 --> 01:20:40.056
We got him on radar! We gotta move now!

01:20:40.158 --> 01:20:42.388
- Bison's got a girl with him.
- What girl?

01:20:42.494 --> 01:20:44.928
<i>- his daughter. her name's Rose.
- Let's get her.</i>

01:20:45.029 --> 01:20:47.156
Okay.

01:20:47.265 --> 01:20:49.290
Move!

01:21:24.202 --> 01:21:26.261
Ah.

01:21:43.822 --> 01:21:46.347
Still no word from Balrog.

01:22:02.807 --> 01:22:04.900
If anything happens to her...

01:22:05.009 --> 01:22:07.239
I'll kill you first.

01:22:27.565 --> 01:22:29.726
Where's the girl?

01:23:54.033 --> 01:23:56.058
<i>hello, old friend.</i>

01:24:01.608 --> 01:24:03.735
You should never have left the team.

01:24:03.843 --> 01:24:05.970
We wouldn't be standing here like this.

01:24:06.079 --> 01:24:09.571
But, of course,
only one of us is standing.

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:15.818
Nice try.

01:24:25.265 --> 01:24:27.233
<i>Seven-six-seven-five.</i>

01:24:39.312 --> 01:24:41.177
<i>You must be Rose.</i>

01:25:04.037 --> 01:25:06.301
<i>hello, old friend.</i>

01:25:15.181 --> 01:25:17.149
<i>Where is she?</i>

01:25:27.861 --> 01:25:30.728
It's time we said good-bye,
old friend.

01:27:35.989 --> 01:27:39.049
Fathers always have a soft spot
for their daughters.

01:27:39.158 --> 01:27:42.457
That's how I brought yours down.

01:27:42.562 --> 01:27:46.259
<i>You didn't thinK this was
going to end well, now, did you?</i>

01:27:55.041 --> 01:27:57.305
<i>Chun-Li.!</i>

01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:59.310
You know what you need to do.

01:28:56.518 --> 01:28:59.612
Fathers always have a weakness
for their daughters.

01:29:03.525 --> 01:29:05.550
Chun-Li.

01:29:09.998 --> 01:29:11.898
Nice work.

01:29:16.705 --> 01:29:19.003
hey, you'd better get out of here.

01:29:20.209 --> 01:29:22.143
Chopper's on the other side of the island.

01:29:22.244 --> 01:29:24.974
I never saw you.

01:29:27.716 --> 01:29:30.207
See to it she gets a real life.

01:29:35.224 --> 01:29:37.351
You too, huh?

01:29:40.863 --> 01:29:43.388
Thanks, Nash.

01:29:48.504 --> 01:29:51.837
Charlie Nash, Interpol! hold your fire!

01:29:57.980 --> 01:29:59.948
hey.

01:30:01.116 --> 01:30:03.016
hey.

01:30:03.118 --> 01:30:06.610
- You're back in business, huh?
- Yep.

01:30:06.722 --> 01:30:09.782
Are you sure you wanna go back
to Gangland homicide?

01:30:09.892 --> 01:30:12.827
- It's what I do.
- It's your first time?

01:30:14.096 --> 01:30:17.122
Nah. I've been there before.

01:30:17.232 --> 01:30:19.166
I can imagine.

01:30:21.403 --> 01:30:24.702
If you get lonely at night, don't call me.

01:30:36.101 --> 01:30:38.763
I love this job.

01:30:45.577 --> 01:30:50.446
<i>I don't thinK
this was the life my father envisioned for me.</i>

01:30:50.549 --> 01:30:52.847
<i>But... maybe it was.</i>

01:30:55.487 --> 01:30:57.751
<i>I Know he would have been proud.</i>

01:31:01.226 --> 01:31:05.560
<i>I've stood when standing was not easy...</i>

01:31:05.664 --> 01:31:08.758
<i>and have found something to believe in.</i>

01:31:11.203 --> 01:31:13.797
<i>Something worth fighting for.</i>

01:31:15.106 --> 01:31:17.267
<i>The Order of the Web.</i>

01:31:31.223 --> 01:31:33.748
Gen!

01:31:41.666 --> 01:31:43.759
There's more work to be done.

01:31:45.237 --> 01:31:48.638
Something about this smells of an old friend.

01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:55.939
- But Bison's dead.
- We need to recruit.

01:31:56.047 --> 01:31:58.015
<i>They've been talKing about
a fighter in Japan...</i>

01:31:58.116 --> 01:32:00.346
<i>Ryu... something.</i>

01:32:00.452 --> 01:32:03.319
<i>I hear he's a force to be recKoned with.</i>

01:32:03.421 --> 01:32:05.116
Wanna come?

01:32:07.892 --> 01:32:09.792
Maybe next time.

01:32:09.894 --> 01:32:11.828
Does this mean you're done fighting?

01:32:26.044 --> 01:32:29.377
No. For now, I'm home.

01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:04.613
<i>Ace... hood.!</i>

01:33:04.716 --> 01:33:07.583
<i>hood.! Brother.!</i>

01:33:07.686 --> 01:33:10.587
<i>LooKat that.! Shit. hey.</i>

01:34:09.447 --> 01:34:11.711
<i>Yeah.</i>
