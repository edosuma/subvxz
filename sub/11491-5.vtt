00:02.730 --> 00:04.900
Not yet. Not yet.

00:05.130 --> 00:08.430
Ok, wait for the traffic until cleared

00:08.430 --> 00:10.400
and then turn into the left lane.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.660
Not yet. Not yet.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.230
Okay. Go

00:15.230 --> 00:16.760
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.660
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

00:23.230 --> 00:24.360
All right, good.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.560
Good, well done.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.430
Thank you.

00:28.430 --> 00:29.900
What are you doing?

00:29.900 --> 00:31.130
Driving.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.730
10, 2.
Both hands-- ten and two.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.130
No, no, like a clock.

00:38.130 --> 00:39.330
10:00 and 2:00.

00:39.330 --> 00:42.160
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.960
Put your left hand on the wheel.

00:45.830 --> 00:47.230
Fine.

00:47.230 --> 00:49.930
You got to like that
he can add ten and two.

00:49.930 --> 00:51.130
Yeah.

00:51.130 --> 00:53.200
And he did it in his head.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.700
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:55.700 --> 00:56.960
Concentrate on the road.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.830
What? You listen to the
radio while you drive.

00:58.830 --> 00:59.760
I'm an experienced driver.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.230
You drive like an old woman.

01:01.230 --> 01:03.360
An experienced old woman.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.000
My point is, never take
your eyes off the road.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.200
Hey, don't distract the kid.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.900
He can barely crap and
read at the same time.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.300
- I can, too!
- Don't look at me!

01:10.300 --> 01:12.360
- Look at the road!
- Don't yell at him! Jake, look out!

01:12.360 --> 01:14.760
Look out!

01:14.760 --> 01:17.200
Will you guys just let me drive?

01:17.200 --> 01:18.530
Fine, fine.

01:18.530 --> 01:19.730
Drive.

01:22.100 --> 01:24.260
So, Charlie,
when's your, uh...

01:24.260 --> 01:25.900
when's your fiance back in town?

01:25.900 --> 01:28.300
Uh... next week.

01:28.300 --> 01:29.830
Huh. So, uh...

01:29.830 --> 01:34.400
so her dad's out of the hospital?

01:34.400 --> 01:35.730
Huh. They give him new
hip and send him home.

01:35.730 --> 01:37.260
So he had a bad hip?

01:37.260 --> 01:38.660
No, Alan,
he has a bad tooth,

01:38.660 --> 01:40.630
but he went to the wrong doctor.

01:40.630 --> 01:42.230
You don't have to be snide.

01:42.230 --> 01:44.200
You don't have to ask
dumb-ass questions.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.230
He didn't ask me anything.

01:46.230 --> 01:48.000
- Yellow light, yellow light, yellow light.
- Speed up.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.730
- Speed up, speed up, speed up!
- Slow down, slow down, slow down!

01:51.800 --> 01:53.860
Okay, I've just about
had it with you two.

01:53.860 --> 01:56.560
Now, if you don't quit it,
I'm got to turn this car around

01:56.560 --> 01:58.060
and nobody's going to the movies.

02:00.800 --> 02:03.200
Man, I've always wanted to say that.

02:06.900 --> 02:08.699
I have to go to the bathroom.

02:08.699 --> 02:11.360
You should have pee when he
made that left turn, like I did.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.330
Oh, there's, uh...
there's three over there.

02:24.330 --> 02:25.930
Too far away.

02:25.930 --> 02:28.560
- Why don't you ever wear your glasses?
- Because I don't need them.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.730
Oh, really? So, why did your
eye doctor prescribe them?

02:30.730 --> 02:31.800
It's racket.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.500
I think they print
those charts blurry,

02:33.500 --> 02:35.360
and then told you
it's your eyes.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.800
Look, can we just sit down?

02:39.530 --> 02:40.800
No, no, slide...
slide over one.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.400
Slide over one.
I need the aisle.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.400
Why do you always need the aisle?

02:44.400 --> 02:46.860
Because he's got a prostate
the size of an apple,

02:46.860 --> 02:48.730
and he has to pee every five minutes.

02:48.730 --> 02:50.330
There's nothing wrong
with my prostate.

02:50.330 --> 02:52.060
I've got a teeny bladder.
It's genetic.

02:52.060 --> 02:54.000
Another reason I think
you were adopted.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.200
Ha, ha.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.530
Wasn't fun when I was
six, not funny now.

02:58.530 --> 03:00.330
For God's sake,
can't you at least wait

03:00.330 --> 03:01.430
until the lights go down?

03:01.430 --> 03:02.760
I'm hungry.

03:02.760 --> 03:03.730
Deviled egg?

03:03.730 --> 03:04.930
No.

03:06.760 --> 03:07.960
Close the lid.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.060
It smells like a box of ass.

03:10.060 --> 03:12.660
I don't know why they
call them deviled eggs.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.400
I think they're just heaven egg.

03:17.230 --> 03:19.930
Why can't you just sneak in
candy like a normal cheapskate?

03:19.930 --> 03:21.300
Way ahead of you.

03:21.300 --> 03:24.130
Still got these left
over from last Halloween.

03:24.130 --> 03:25.700
Shh.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.100
What the hell are you doing?

03:32.100 --> 03:34.560
How am I supposed to
have a rum and Coke

03:34.560 --> 03:35.860
without the rum?

03:35.860 --> 03:37.500
You're not supposed to bring
liquor into a movie theater.

03:37.500 --> 03:41.100
Oh, itÂ‘s fine to bring a box of ass

03:43.030 --> 03:44.100
Charlie Where are you going?

03:44.100 --> 03:45.260
I'm going to sit over here.

03:45.260 --> 03:47.430
But... but this is family time.

03:48.260 --> 03:50.430
I like this family better.

03:52.030 --> 03:53.600
Oh, damn it!

03:53.600 --> 03:55.460
I have to pee.

03:59.260 --> 04:01.300
Oh, great.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.530
Focus!

04:04.430 --> 04:05.800
Focus!

04:06.860 --> 04:08.730
Focus!

04:11.700 --> 04:13.430
Another great movie choice, Alan.

04:13.430 --> 04:14.730
Excuse me,
but it was recommended

04:14.730 --> 04:15.960
by four out of five critics

04:15.960 --> 04:17.730
who were not plowed when they saw it.

04:17.730 --> 04:19.600
Can we please just get some ice cream?

04:19.600 --> 04:21.060
You sure we need to buy some?

04:21.060 --> 04:23.360
Your dad probably has
gelato in his pants.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.560
Uh-oh.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.600
- What?
- Nothing.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.400
- You know those girls?
- Kinda.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.100
You want to go over and say hello?

04:32.100 --> 04:33.360
Alan, don't be an idiot.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.800
No teenager wants to be
seen out with his father.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.760
Especially when his father
stinks of deviled ass eggs.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.560
Yeah, but teenagers love to be seen

04:40.560 --> 04:42.660
with degenerate rum-soaked uncles

04:42.660 --> 04:46.460
who always dress like they're
on line at Epcot Center.

04:46.460 --> 04:49.960
Well, pardon me for
having a personal style.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.100
Will you guys please,
please shut up?

04:53.100 --> 04:54.130
Hi, Jake.

04:54.130 --> 04:55.960
Hey.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.160
Oh. She's cute.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.430
You guys go to school together?

04:58.430 --> 04:59.960
Of course they go to school together.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.960
Where else is he going
to meet a girl like that?

05:01.960 --> 05:03.500
He has outside interests.
He could've met her anywhere.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.930
He only has two outside interests,

05:04.930 --> 05:06.430
and I don't think he met her

05:06.430 --> 05:08.260
at a taco truck or a public toilet.

05:08.260 --> 05:10.400
You know what, I'm not
hungry. Let's just go.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.400
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.430
We're not going anywhere.

05:12.430 --> 05:13.530
I want ice cream.

05:13.530 --> 05:17.000
- Why, you going to pour rum on it?
- No.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.100
CrÃ¨me de cacao

05:19.100 --> 05:21.200
All that drinking. You
know, I feel sorry for you.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.160
Don't feel sorry for me.
You're the reason I drink!

05:23.160 --> 05:25.500
Oh, please!
If it weren't for me,

05:25.500 --> 05:27.660
you would've choked on
your own vomit years ago.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.700
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

05:28.700 --> 05:32.030
I was vomit in my sleep long
before you came into my life,

05:32.030 --> 05:34.760
and I'll be vomiting
long after you're gone.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.560
- Next, please.
- Oh, yeah.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.700
Uh, I would like to sample

05:39.700 --> 05:41.600
the, uh...
the Passion Fruit,

05:41.600 --> 05:43.300
and the Banana Brickle,

05:43.300 --> 05:46.130
and-- ooh-- uh, maybe the,
uh, Nutty Butter Buddy.

05:46.130 --> 05:49.130
Oh, geez-- why don't you just
get a double scoop of gayberry

05:49.130 --> 05:50.060
and be done with it?

05:50.060 --> 05:52.000
What... What do you want, Jake?

05:52.000 --> 05:54.860
A quick,
painless death.

05:54.860 --> 05:57.230
Hey, what happened
to those cute girls?

05:57.230 --> 05:58.300
They left.

05:58.300 --> 05:59.300
Oh, too bad.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.500
I think the one liked you.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.000
They were looking over here a lot.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.760
I know.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.430
Next time,
take a little initiative.

06:05.430 --> 06:08.560
Yeah. We're not always going
to be here to support you.

06:12.660 --> 06:15.760
So, you peek over your right shoulder

06:15.760 --> 06:19.830
and slide it into the spot.

06:19.830 --> 06:21.200
Parallel parking.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.930
Easy peasy.

06:22.930 --> 06:24.460
Are we home?

06:24.460 --> 06:25.960
We're dropping off Jake.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.160
Oh.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.400
I kind of got a sugar
crash off that ice cream.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.900
Oh, yeah,
it had nothing to do

06:30.900 --> 06:33.260
with the four ounces of
liqueur you poured over it.

06:33.260 --> 06:36.360
Better liqueur than
Halloween leftovers.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.460
They charge 50 cents for each topping,

06:38.460 --> 06:40.260
and I had perfectly good candy corn.

06:41.130 --> 06:42.400
Okay, bye.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.600
See you next weekend.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.600
- Yeah, maybe.
- What's that mean?

06:45.600 --> 06:47.460
I'll call you.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.830
Okey doke.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.500
Boy, you really pissed him off.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.800
I pissed him off?
What about you?

06:56.800 --> 06:58.000
Hey, he likes me.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.900
Oh, please.
Nobody likes you.

06:59.900 --> 07:03.130
We only tolerate you because
you have a lot of money.

07:03.130 --> 07:04.400
All right, get out.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.500
What are you talking about?

07:05.500 --> 07:07.000
This is my car.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.500
Fine.
How much do you want for it?

07:08.500 --> 07:10.600
Don't be ridiculous.

07:10.600 --> 07:14.960
We talking blue book? 'Cause
I just put a new tire on it.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.430
You are a lush!

07:22.430 --> 07:23.760
You are a leech

07:23.760 --> 07:25.930
You are a misogynist!

07:25.930 --> 07:29.130
You are a mistake!

07:29.130 --> 07:31.260
You are a...

07:31.260 --> 07:33.100
- What are we up to?
- "N."

07:33.100 --> 07:34.260
Thank you.

07:34.260 --> 07:36.100
Uh, you are a...

07:36.100 --> 07:37.160
necrophiliac.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.800
She was drunk,
not dead.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.030
I challenge.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.500
Ok, fine.
You're a narcissist.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.360
Better.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.500
You are a Nancy boy.

07:53.330 --> 07:56.160
You are old.

07:57.930 --> 08:01.560
You are odd...

08:01.560 --> 08:03.630
...ly shaped.

08:03.630 --> 08:05.360
Hang on.

08:06.260 --> 08:08.160
You are a parasite.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.230
Not your turn.

08:09.230 --> 08:10.930
Hello.

08:10.930 --> 08:13.660
Oh, hey, Judith.
What's up?

08:13.660 --> 08:15.900
What do you mean, what
happened with Jake?

08:15.900 --> 08:17.160
We had a nice weekend.

08:17.160 --> 08:20.360
Well, we went driving, to
the movies, um, ice cream.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.660
Quack, rectal, suck-wad!

08:23.330 --> 08:25.030
I never got my "P."

08:25.030 --> 08:27.200
All you do is pee.

08:28.260 --> 08:29.830
What? What?
Uh, n-nothing.

08:29.830 --> 08:31.000
Little... little word game.
You know,

08:31.000 --> 08:32.200
exercise the brain.
Twit!

08:32.200 --> 08:33.600
- Turd
- burglar!

08:35.360 --> 08:38.059
Judith, I-I-I don't know
what Jake's problem is.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.360
We had a terrific weekend.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.799
Huh.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.200
Jake says he doesn't want
to come here anymore.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.030
Really? Why?

08:46.030 --> 08:47.660
I don't know.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.530
Did he say why?

08:49.530 --> 08:51.560
Charlie and I don't bicker.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.800
I mean,
no more than any other couple.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.900
Of guys.

08:59.900 --> 09:01.500
Right?

09:01.500 --> 09:02.560
Right.

09:02.560 --> 09:03.700
Oh, oh,!

09:03.700 --> 09:04.800
You are a eunuch.

09:05.660 --> 09:07.730
E U. That's "E,"
not "U."

09:07.730 --> 09:09.330
Learn to spell.
Useless!

09:11.000 --> 09:13.160
Look, I don't know what to tell you.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.030
He's a teenager--
he'll get over it.

09:15.030 --> 09:16.960
Okay. Okay.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.300
Bye-bye.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.030
Well, I hope you're happy.

09:20.030 --> 09:22.700
I haven't been happy in seven years.

09:22.700 --> 09:26.060
For your information, I will not have
been here seven years until next fall.

09:26.060 --> 09:27.760
Oh, good to know.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.130
Circle the date on the calendar

09:29.130 --> 09:31.000
so I'll know when to hang myself.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.360
Ha, ha. Funny.

09:32.360 --> 09:35.560
- It-it's because of you Jake doesn't
want to come here anymore. - Great.

09:35.560 --> 09:38.260
Tell me what I did
so I can do it to you.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.600
God, you are such a...

09:41.600 --> 09:43.430
- What are we up to?
- "V."

09:43.430 --> 09:45.230
Varmint!

09:45.230 --> 09:46.630
You are a varmint.

09:46.630 --> 09:48.760
Yeah, well...

09:48.760 --> 09:50.800
you are a vagina.

09:54.730 --> 09:56.430
You're calling me a vagina?

09:56.430 --> 09:57.430
No, no, no, no, no.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.800
No, that's too good for you.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.660
What you are is...

10:02.660 --> 10:04.930
vagina adjacent.

10:06.630 --> 10:07.930
You know,
for some women

10:07.930 --> 10:10.930
this could be considered a
hostile work environment.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.060
Isn't it past your bedtime?

10:23.100 --> 10:26.130
I don't like to go to sleep angry.

10:26.130 --> 10:28.130
Try drinking more.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.860
What will that solve?

10:30.860 --> 10:32.730
Sobriety.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.660
We need to talk.

10:35.660 --> 10:37.030
Oh, good.

10:37.030 --> 10:40.000
I was so worried we
weren't going to talk.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.360
I've been thinking.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.060
Maybe Jake not wanting
to hang out here

10:44.060 --> 10:45.500
does have something to do with us.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.360
I mean, we have been
fighting a lot lately.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.730
So?

10:48.730 --> 10:50.800
So, don't you want him
to feel comfortable re?

10:50.800 --> 10:52.330
He farts at the dinner table.

10:52.330 --> 10:55.500
How much more comfortable
do we want him?

10:55.500 --> 10:57.500
Charlie, if we don't
figure way out to get along

10:57.500 --> 10:59.460
there's a chance we might
not see him anymore.

10:59.460 --> 11:01.630
And the downside is...?

11:01.630 --> 11:04.030
Come on, tough guy,
you know you love him.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.530
Why don't you just admit it?

11:05.530 --> 11:07.130
Okay, I love him.

11:07.130 --> 11:09.630
Now go to your room and masturbate.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.700
Already did,
still can't sleep.

11:20.360 --> 11:24.160
My point is, we have to
work out our differences

11:24.160 --> 11:26.360
for the sake of the child.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.330
Are you out of your mind?

11:30.330 --> 11:31.630
I mean,
if it weren't for Jake,

11:31.630 --> 11:33.230
we could just shake
hands and walk away.

11:33.230 --> 11:35.120
After what you've been doing,

11:35.120 --> 11:36.500
There'll be no shaking hands

11:37.260 --> 11:39.430
I keep Purell in my nightstand.

11:39.430 --> 11:41.230
I'm not an animal.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.560
Where is this going, Alan?

11:45.560 --> 11:48.260
Well, I am glad you asked.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.400
A Blueprint for Love?

11:51.400 --> 11:53.290
It's a workbook

11:53.290 --> 11:54.100
Judith and I got in
couples counseling.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.630
But the principles can be applied

11:55.630 --> 11:57.700
to any two human beings
in a relationship.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.100
I see.

11:59.100 --> 12:02.130
So you did this right
before e kicked your ass out

12:02.130 --> 12:03.600
and took everything you own?

12:03.600 --> 12:05.930
The principles are sound.

12:05.930 --> 12:08.230
Judith is an unreasonable bitch.

12:09.330 --> 12:13.400
Now, okay, uh, the, um,
the first exercise--

12:13.400 --> 12:15.500
"Building a Foundation of Trust."

12:15.500 --> 12:18.400
So, we eh say three things
we admire about the other.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.960
Uh, I will go first.
Um...

12:19.960 --> 12:22.560
I admire your sense of humor,

12:22.560 --> 12:24.860
uh, your generosity

12:24.860 --> 12:26.900
and your
devil-may-care attitude.

12:26.900 --> 12:29.030
Thank you.

12:29.030 --> 12:31.760
Now, your turn-- three
things you admire about me.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.130
Three? Really?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.260
All right, uh...

12:42.260 --> 12:44.600
I like that you think I'm funny.

12:45.860 --> 12:47.430
Good one.

12:47.430 --> 12:49.060
Still counts, right?

12:49.900 --> 12:51.960
Sure.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.230
Two to go.

12:53.230 --> 12:53.900
What did Judith put?

12:53.910 --> 12:57.460
No cheating.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.030
Okay.

12:59.030 --> 13:03.130
Uh... you love your kid,
which can't be easy.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.560
And...

13:07.560 --> 13:11.130
you disinfect your hands
after you masturbate.

13:14.700 --> 13:16.860
Thank you.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.060
Now, that wasn't so difficult,
was it?

13:20.060 --> 13:21.900
Okay, next.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.700
There's more?

13:23.700 --> 13:25.360
Have we healed our
relationship, Charlie?

13:25.360 --> 13:26.660
I'm good.

13:30.660 --> 13:31.940
Ok. Three things you would
change about your partner

13:31.940 --> 13:32.960
and three things you would
change about yourself.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.300
This time u start.

13:34.300 --> 13:38.330
Why would I want to change
anything about myself?

13:38.330 --> 13:39.500
You're kidding, right?

13:39.500 --> 13:40.660
You think you're perfect?

13:40.660 --> 13:43.030
In my way.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.430
Oh, so you he no flaws?

13:44.430 --> 13:47.800
Let us consider the hummingbird, Alan.

13:49.230 --> 13:51.030
Or the butterfly.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.630
All of God's creature are perfect

13:52.630 --> 13:54.500
just the way he made them.

13:55.260 --> 13:58.230
Except you. You suck.

13:58.230 --> 14:00.200
Okay. Okay, fine.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.360
Name three things you
would change about me.

14:02.360 --> 14:02.960
Your personality,

14:03.400 --> 14:04.960
your wardrobe and your address.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.480
Thank you.

14:15.660 --> 14:17.700
Your voice,

14:17.700 --> 14:20.030
your face, and again,
your address.

14:21.930 --> 14:23.330
All right... All right.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.430
Your haircut, your
fruity little workbook

14:25.430 --> 14:27.030
and your address.

14:27.030 --> 14:30.500
Just... Just needed three.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.000
Oh, come on,
we're healing.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.930
Your cheapness,

14:34.930 --> 14:37.460
your smug arrogance and your address.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.860
I'm leaving.

14:40.760 --> 14:44.430
Hey, this thing really works!

14:52.300 --> 14:53.860
The way you chew your food,

14:53.860 --> 14:56.600
the hair in your ears
and your address.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.630
That stopped being funny a week ago.

14:59.630 --> 15:01.730
Judges?

15:01.730 --> 15:03.360
Still funny.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.960
So where's the kid this weekend?

15:06.960 --> 15:08.660
He's not coming,
thanks to my brother.

15:08.660 --> 15:11.130
Thank you, Charlie.

15:13.060 --> 15:15.530
Sure, lay it all on me.

15:15.530 --> 15:16.960
Nothing's ever your fault.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.360
Hey, at least I was willing
to work on our problems.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.000
What, that stupid Blueprint for Love?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.160
That was just an excuse
to try to change me.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.410
You knew who I was

15:24.410 --> 15:25.330
when you moved in here.

15:25.330 --> 15:26.930
That doesn't mean you can't grow.

15:26.930 --> 15:27.930
Why can't you grow?

15:27.930 --> 15:29.100
Because you hold me back!

15:29.100 --> 15:30.460
Stop it!

15:30.460 --> 15:33.830
Can't you see you're
tearing this family apart?!

15:38.460 --> 15:41.300
Hah!
What a couple of 'mos.

15:42.330 --> 15:44.900
Look, can we at least
establish some ground rules

15:44.900 --> 15:47.130
about how we treat each
other in front of Jake

15:47.130 --> 15:48.900
Like what?

15:48.900 --> 15:51.130
Like we agree that if there's
something's bothering us

15:51.130 --> 15:53.600
- we wait and discuss it privately.
- Fine.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.130
- And no
name-calling. - Done.

15:55.130 --> 15:56.260
And the sarcasm.

15:56.260 --> 15:57.400
While you and I know

15:57.400 --> 15:59.160
that our good-nared
ribbing is all in fun,

15:59.160 --> 16:00.560
Jake might perceive as hostile.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.660
I hate you.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.060
Exactly.

16:03.060 --> 16:04.260
If Jake heard you say that,

16:04.260 --> 16:05.460
he'd think you really meant it.

16:05.460 --> 16:07.360
I do mean it.
I hate you.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.230
Funny.
One of those things

16:09.230 --> 16:10.500
I admire about you.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.460
Now, come on, we'll get
dressed and go talk to Jake.

16:12.460 --> 16:13.560
You know,
I just thought

16:13.560 --> 16:15.100
of another thing I'd change about you.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.360
Oh, yeah? What's that?

16:16.360 --> 16:18.600
Your inability to accept my hatred.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.930
And your address!

16:25.730 --> 16:27.300
Hey.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.300
He still says he doesn't want to
spend the weekend with you two.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.760
You heard her,
Al. Let's go.

16:30.760 --> 16:31.900
Oh, stop it.

16:31.900 --> 16:33.230
I'm serious.
We don't need him.

16:33.230 --> 16:35.900
I can pick my nose and
wipe it on your car seat.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.060
We'll talk to him.

16:37.060 --> 16:38.330
- Where is he?
- In his room.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.200
Let me ask you something. How did
you convince Alan you hated him?

16:43.200 --> 16:45.060
- What?
- He won't believe me.

16:45.060 --> 16:46.560
Charlie!

16:46.560 --> 16:48.930
It's not like I can
withhold sex, like you did.

16:48.930 --> 16:50.960
If you think of anything,
text me.

16:59.230 --> 17:01.330
You are getting pretty good.

17:01.330 --> 17:03.000
I'm just tuning it.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.960
Well, tune on, broheim.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.900
What are you doing here?

17:09.900 --> 17:11.900
Okay, first of all,

17:11.900 --> 17:14.859
your uncle and I would
like to apologize

17:14.859 --> 17:16.230
for our behavior last week.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.329
I've got nothing to apologize for.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.160
Oh, really?
So you've been just perfect

17:21.160 --> 17:22.200
through this whole thing?

17:22.200 --> 17:24.859
What can I tell you?
I'm a hummingbird.

17:24.859 --> 17:26.230
Shut up, Charlie.

17:26.230 --> 17:28.400
I hate you,
and you were adopted.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.900
Your uncle and I understand

17:33.900 --> 17:36.100
That we might have
made you uncomfortable,

17:36.100 --> 17:37.800
And we want you to know

17:37.800 --> 17:40.430
that we're going to make
a real effort to change.

17:40.430 --> 17:42.230
When are you planning to start?

17:42.230 --> 17:44.100
Right now.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.660
- Right, Charlie?
- Yeah, sure.

17:45.660 --> 17:47.530
- So, you guys will stop fighting so much?
- Yes.

17:47.530 --> 17:50.300
Uh-huh. And you won't
embarrass me in public anymore?

17:50.300 --> 17:52.260
When did we embarrass you in public?

17:52.260 --> 17:54.260
Oh, come on, you
embarrass him constantly.

17:54.260 --> 17:56.130
- Uh, you don't?
- Hey, I'm the colorful uncle.

17:56.130 --> 17:58.560
One day, he'll be
telling his kids all kinds

17:58.560 --> 17:59.830
of funny stories about me.

17:59.830 --> 18:01.430
He'll be telling
stories about me, too.

18:01.430 --> 18:03.460
Yeah, to his court-appointed
psychiatrist.

18:05.260 --> 18:07.300
You know, you have got a cruel
streak that is just ugly.

18:07.300 --> 18:08.760
You want to know what's just ugly?

18:08.760 --> 18:10.360
The schmuck who living my guest room.

18:10.360 --> 18:13.000
At least I am not an aging pretty boy

18:13.000 --> 18:15.630
desperately clinging on to
the last dregs of his youth.

18:16.230 --> 18:18.400
What are you saying,
I'm losing my looks?

18:19.530 --> 18:20.460
Oh, now you're worried.

18:20.460 --> 18:22.300
Let me tell you something, pal.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.960
Looks is all you've ever had.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.860
No heart, no soul, no depth
of character whatsoever.

18:26.860 --> 18:28.230
Come on, be honest.

18:28.230 --> 18:29.700
Which would you rather have?

18:29.700 --> 18:32.000
My looks or those other three things?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.860
You know what? Bite me!

18:34.860 --> 18:37.200
I can't believe you actually bit me.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.400
Wait, wait!

18:39.400 --> 18:40.660
I thought you were
going to talk to him.

18:40.660 --> 18:42.730
We did. He's still
kind of upset with us.

18:42.730 --> 18:43.860
You know teenage.

18:43.860 --> 18:45.200
You just can't reason with them.

18:45.200 --> 18:48.160
Oh, really?
Wait right here.

18:49.230 --> 18:50.700
I don't give a damn!

18:50.700 --> 18:53.100
Weekends are the only
peace. Get around here.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.160
They're both losers!

18:55.160 --> 18:56.500
Deal with it!

18:56.500 --> 19:00.230
Now get your ass up and
go with your father!

19:01.960 --> 19:03.930
I'm driving.

19:03.930 --> 19:05.300
I call shotgun.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.000
Shotgun?
What are you, a child?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.260
Me a child?
You just bit me.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.430
Hey, and don't rev
it! You're wasting gas!

19:14.060 --> 19:15.930
Hey, come back here!

19:15.930 --> 19:17.060
Was he waving,

19:17.060 --> 19:19.460
or did he just give us the finger?

19:19.460 --> 19:21.160
Both hands on the wheel!

19:21.160 --> 19:23.360
10:00 and 2:00!

19:33.300 --> 19:34.730
Okay. Okay.

19:34.730 --> 19:39.960
That completes the "How to
Disagree in a Loving Way" section.

19:39.960 --> 19:42.730
I think we did very well.

19:42.730 --> 19:45.630
I disagree...

19:45.630 --> 19:47.260
but in a loving way.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.400
Okay, okay, next.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.460
Um... things we have in common.

19:54.830 --> 19:55.900
Charlie.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.160
Same last name.
Same last name.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.500
Oh! Very nice,
very nice.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.460
Drink?

20:02.460 --> 20:04.400
Uh, yes, I am.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.400
Okay, things we have in common,
things we have in common.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.630
Uh... Mom!

20:15.630 --> 20:17.260
We both have the some mother.

20:17.260 --> 20:18.800
No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.000
You're adopted.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.060
Oh, right, right, right.

20:24.060 --> 20:25.430
Okay, let's see,
let's see.

20:25.430 --> 20:27.130
Uh, what do we have in common?

20:27.130 --> 20:29.630
Uh... Oh, oh, oh!
Uh, here's one.

20:29.630 --> 20:32.130
Um, we both feel unworthy of love

20:32.130 --> 20:34.900
and battle homosexual panic.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.400
Maybe that's just me.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.330
Maybe.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.630
Okay, okay,
here's one, here one.

20:49.630 --> 20:51.860
Uh, we both love Jake.

20:51.860 --> 20:53.130
Oh, Jake.

20:54.360 --> 20:56.100
Yeah, I love him.

20:56.100 --> 20:59.060
Where is the little fart meister?

20:59.060 --> 21:00.900
I think he's sleeping.

21:00.900 --> 21:03.760
Oh, he needs to know we love him.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.860
You're right.
You're right.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.300
We wouldn't tell him enough.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.900
Come on, let's go wake him
up and tell him we love him.

21:11.400 --> 21:15.060
Mmm, good idea,
good idea.

21:15.060 --> 21:17.730
Jake!

21:18.630 --> 21:21.630
Guess who loves you!

21:22.305 --> 21:28.309
