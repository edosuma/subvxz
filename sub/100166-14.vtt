"Enjoy these days, they pass so quickly."

13:01.280 --> 13:05.701
Yeah! Berk! Berk! Berk! Berk!
Berk! Berk! Berk! Berk!

13:05.785 --> 13:07.661
And now, our challenger.

13:07.745 --> 13:11.207
She's talented, sweet, and loves to eat.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.875
Ramona Gibbler!

13:13.334 --> 13:18.714
[cheering]

13:22.051 --> 13:24.887
We finally meet, Berkowitz.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.556
What's up, Fun Size?

13:27.681 --> 13:30.059
Shouldn't you be eating your Lunchables?

13:32.686 --> 13:34.271
What, you think you got
what it takes?

13:34.355 --> 13:36.899
[scoffs] Do I look like I don't?

13:38.734 --> 13:42.154
You're right. I'm going to rescind
that question, but keep the attitude.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.161
-Hey, Ramona.
-Ethan.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.372
Hey, you're here.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.832
Why are you here?

13:53.374 --> 13:56.293
To cheer on my amazing girlfriend.
I want to support you.

13:57.461 --> 14:01.173
You really didn't have to do that, like,
really, really didn't have to do that.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.551
I wouldn't have missed this for anything.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.760
[chuckles nervously]

14:04.844 --> 14:06.470
All right, eaters.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.305
The sandwiches are ready.

14:08.848 --> 14:09.682
Great.

14:09.765 --> 14:10.766
Um...

14:10.933 --> 14:12.351
Just excuse me one sec.

14:16.772 --> 14:17.857
Ramona!

14:17.940 --> 14:20.818
She's forfeiting, I knew it! [laughs]

14:20.901 --> 14:22.236
Berkowitz win!

14:24.029 --> 14:25.698
Okay, not so fast, all right.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.950
I'm gonna go check and see how she is.

14:28.617 --> 14:31.537
Chop-chop, girlfriend.
I don't wanna be late for my spin class.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.794
Didn't you read the sign? Employees only.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.212
Oh, come on.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.755
No one actually works here.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.092
What happened out there?

14:45.843 --> 14:47.011
It's no big deal, it's just...

14:47.511 --> 14:50.180
a stomach thing
and a breathing thing, and a...

14:50.431 --> 14:52.558
a sweating thing.
Am I sweating? I'm sweating, aren't I?

14:54.518 --> 14:56.103
It's just performance anxiety.

14:56.812 --> 14:59.690
I promise, once you're out there,
the nerves are gonna go away.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.526
I need Ethan to go away.

15:04.486 --> 15:05.487
Oh.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.615
So that's what this is all about.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.160
Ethan's gonna see me
shoving food in my face,

15:11.243 --> 15:14.496
and I know I'm supposed to be
all warrior woman, but...

15:15.956 --> 15:18.042
I don't want my boyfriend to see me so...

15:18.667 --> 15:19.793
Unfeminine?

15:20.669 --> 15:21.545
Yeah.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.090
And I hate myself for caring
that he's gonna see me like that.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.802
I didn't think I was the kind of girl
to care, the woman to care.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.055
I'm a disgrace to my gender.

15:31.555 --> 15:32.681
No.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.391
No, you're not.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.477
You are your gender.

15:37.061 --> 15:40.731
Women get all these mixed signals.
We're told to act like one of the boys.

15:40.814 --> 15:43.108
But... then when we do,
the boys get intimidated.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.569
-It's infuriating.
-And exhausting.

15:47.237 --> 15:50.574
Look, Ramona, one of the most liberating
things I ever did

15:50.741 --> 15:53.035
was to stop caring what people thought
about me.

15:53.827 --> 15:54.703
Even DJ?

15:54.787 --> 15:56.080
Well, let's not get crazy.

15:59.708 --> 16:00.668
So...

16:01.085 --> 16:05.714
if a guy thinks me power eating against
a 300-pound man is wrong, then...

16:07.341 --> 16:08.509
he's wrong for me.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.469
You said it, sister.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.137
Come here.

16:12.972 --> 16:13.806
Mmm.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.434
Now, go out there and eat like a girl.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.647
-[triumphant music playing]
-[audience cheering]

16:26.360 --> 16:27.194
Go, Ramona!

16:27.695 --> 16:29.446
You're a Gibbler with the gift of gobble,

16:29.530 --> 16:31.073
so keep gobbling, Gibbler!

16:32.241 --> 16:35.119
You got him on the ropes.
Now finish him, Ro-Ro.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.328
Ro-Ro?

16:36.412 --> 16:38.288
Now he's using unclever nicknames?

16:40.040 --> 16:41.959
What, are you tapping out there,
Little Debbie?

16:42.918 --> 16:44.461
You wish, Jerkowitz.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.714
You can do it, Ramona!

16:49.341 --> 16:51.927
All right, three, two, one!

16:52.011 --> 16:52.886
[blows horn]

16:52.970 --> 16:54.138
Sandwiches down.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.558
Berkowitz, 12 sandwiches.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.143
Yes! Personal best!

16:59.268 --> 17:01.478
Berkowitz wins, baby! Yeah!

17:02.021 --> 17:04.857
Ramona Gibbler ate 13 sandwiches.

17:04.940 --> 17:07.109
Yes! Gibbler wins, baby!

17:09.486 --> 17:13.198
Ramona Gibbler reclaims the Golden Sub
for Uncle Monty!

17:13.282 --> 17:14.116
Oh!

17:14.199 --> 17:15.909
-She did it!
-[all cheering]

17:18.579 --> 17:19.663
You're pretty tough.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.165
Thanks, kid.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.583
So was that turkey.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.418
I'm going to be Yelping about that.

17:29.423 --> 17:32.259
That was the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.429
Really? It didn't gross you out
even a little bit?

17:35.846 --> 17:37.473
Nothing you do could gross me out.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.640
Aw!

17:40.100 --> 17:42.102
[gasping]

17:42.770 --> 17:44.688
Attention, everyone!

17:46.940 --> 17:49.735
There is not a possum in the kitchen.

17:50.235 --> 17:53.363
But, please, exit immediately
before you get bitten

17:53.655 --> 17:55.657
by not... a possum.

17:58.368 --> 18:00.954
[vocalizing]

18:03.248 --> 18:04.291
Look at this.

18:04.374 --> 18:07.669
Max had me buy him pants
with an elastic waistband.

18:10.589 --> 18:13.050
I didn't want to tell you, but earlier,

18:13.342 --> 18:15.552
I heard him burp the entire alphabet.

18:18.847 --> 18:22.101
P through Z was a struggle,
but he muscled through it.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.106
What did I do?

18:27.898 --> 18:29.566
Well, I pushed him too hard.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.486
I had such high expectations for Max

18:32.569 --> 18:35.239
and I thought if anyone could handle
this jump, it would be him.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.199
[groans]

18:37.366 --> 18:38.659
I'm a terrible mother.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.705
No, you're not.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.999
You did what you thought was best.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.751
And you thought wrong.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.297
Thanks a lot, Kimmy.

18:52.881 --> 18:56.385
Well, nobody could have predicted
that he would go in this direction.

18:58.262 --> 19:01.014
Actually...
maybe I could have predicted it.

19:02.850 --> 19:03.684
You?

19:04.601 --> 19:06.311
I think I know what this is about.

19:06.895 --> 19:09.690
This is field trip to Fisherman's Wharf
all over again.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.525
Of course.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.778
Definitely field trip
to Fisherman's Wharf.

19:19.825 --> 19:20.701
Come on.

19:26.039 --> 19:26.915
[sighs]

19:27.749 --> 19:30.085
You've led me astray long enough,
Calvin Klein.

19:31.795 --> 19:32.629
It's over.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.261
[DJ] Hey, Max.

19:40.012 --> 19:44.600
I got you those sweatpants
and a... shirt with a sports logo.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.646
Awesome, I was just getting rid of some of
my baby clothes to make room for them.

19:50.230 --> 19:54.443
Uh, hey, buddy, did I ever tell you
about the field trip

19:54.526 --> 19:56.904
Kimmy and I took to Fisherman's Wharf?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.281
We were in the third grade,

19:59.865 --> 20:01.909
and Kimmy was sitting on the bus alone,

20:02.242 --> 20:04.369
wearing her classic bacon and egg scarf.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.040
That's why I was alone.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.334
All the kids always made fun of it.

20:11.335 --> 20:14.338
Nobody wanted to sit with me
because they thought I was weird.

20:16.006 --> 20:20.260
But then, somebody did sit next to me.
Do you know who that was?

20:20.928 --> 20:22.262
Let me guess. My mom.

20:22.971 --> 20:23.805
How did you know?

20:26.725 --> 20:29.937
We're having a heart-to-heart talk
and if it wasn't my mom,

20:30.020 --> 20:31.355
this would be kind of pointless.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.861
Well, that bacon and egg scarf
was the reason I knew

20:37.945 --> 20:39.696
I had to be friends with Kimmy.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.283
I mean, someone who wore that
had to be fun and exciting.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.578
I'm a very dynamic individual, Max.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.999
I loved how unique Kimmy was,

20:51.208 --> 20:54.294
and if she changed herself to fit in,
I would have never noticed her.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.464
Well, I don't have a DJ.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.303
At lunch, I heard the kids
who dress like this

21:03.387 --> 21:05.722
say that I looked like an extra
from Young Sheldon.

21:09.142 --> 21:11.520
An extra, not even the lead!

21:14.481 --> 21:15.774
I ate lunch alone.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.401
All these kids laughed at me.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.611
And I could hear them the whole time.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.991
Oh, Max, I'm so sorry.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.705
I know I've always been a little different
than the other kids...

21:30.247 --> 21:31.707
but I've never cared before.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.168
But I guess middle school
is just different.

21:35.252 --> 21:38.714
So I thought it'd be safer
just to blend in.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.340
That way they'd leave me alone.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.138
I want the names of those kids
and their phone numbers

21:46.221 --> 21:48.223
because I am going to tear them--

21:56.315 --> 21:57.816
Fall back, Mama Bear.

21:59.943 --> 22:00.861
Look.

22:02.654 --> 22:05.365
I know it seems like blending in
is better right now.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.367
Trust me, Max,

22:08.327 --> 22:10.412
kids like us were meant to stand out.

22:11.913 --> 22:14.333
Life might be more complicated and...

22:15.042 --> 22:18.003
it may take a little longer to find
our place in this world,

22:18.587 --> 22:19.796
but once we do...

22:22.215 --> 22:24.509
it's filled with true support and love.

22:26.219 --> 22:29.514
Max, you are so special,
and we love who you are.

22:30.223 --> 22:32.976
And you will find people
at your school and in life

22:33.060 --> 22:35.562
who will appreciate the authentic Max.

22:36.146 --> 22:37.689
Just like your mom found me.

22:40.108 --> 22:40.942
Really?

22:41.651 --> 22:42.694
I promise.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.905
What a relief.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.163
Oh, I'm sorry, Calvin Klein.
I will never abandon you again.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.124
Oh, my boy is back.

22:59.920 --> 23:05.133
[vocalizing]

23:05.217 --> 23:06.635
There you go, Mama.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.054
-You've earned this.
-We all did.

23:09.638 --> 23:14.017
You got Ramona through her issue
and you got Max and me through ours.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.269
Yeah, we are pretty great.

23:16.728 --> 23:17.562
To us.

23:18.355 --> 23:19.398
And to our children.

23:19.481 --> 23:22.275
May we nurture their talents,
whatever they may be.

23:24.277 --> 23:27.614
And may they dress however they like
and be whoever they are.

23:27.697 --> 23:31.201
Yeah, and may they poop once a day
and sleep through the night.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.829
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.914
[Dani crying]

23:36.540 --> 23:38.708
Well, so much for that.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.131
