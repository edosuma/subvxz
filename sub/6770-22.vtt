WEBVTT

00:09.175 --> 00:10.760
Hey.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.972
Oh. Where have you been?

00:14.973 --> 00:17.392
I've... been around.

00:17.475 --> 00:19.269
Hmm, just not here.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.146
I was starting
to take it personally.

00:21.229 --> 00:22.230
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:22.313 --> 00:23.481
CAMILLE:
Hey. I ran into Frank

00:23.565 --> 00:25.066
from the big and tall store.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.652
He got your wool
you ordered online.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.112
Oh, great.

00:29.195 --> 00:30.613
Hi, dear.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.241
You order a lot of stuff

00:33.324 --> 00:34.033
off the Internet?

00:34.117 --> 00:35.702
Oh, yeah,
practically everything.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.287
She saves a fortune
on sales tax.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.414
Go ahead. Tell him your idea.

00:39.497 --> 00:42.333
Oh, right. Uh, I'm thinking
of starting a Web site

00:42.417 --> 00:43.585
for the store.

00:43.668 --> 00:46.588
DonnaMartinOriginals.com.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.757
Cool California clothes
made available

00:48.840 --> 00:50.133
with the click of a mouse.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.634
DAVID: You know,
if you're really serious,

00:51.718 --> 00:54.137
I know a great Web designer.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.472
Oh, yeah.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.973
Here-- name,

00:57.056 --> 00:58.975
number.

00:59.058 --> 01:03.021
And by the way,
you're too perfect.

01:03.104 --> 01:05.190
Hey, I'm going
to get some coffee,

01:05.272 --> 01:07.192
and we're out of here.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.152
And give her that.
Right. See you tomorrow.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.156
So you two are good?

01:14.908 --> 01:16.951
Uh, yeah... you know.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.120
Well, when you stopped
coming by.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.122
I didn't stop coming by, Donna.

01:21.206 --> 01:21.998
I've just been trying to

01:22.081 --> 01:23.666
keep a respectful distance.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.001
From what?

01:25.084 --> 01:25.960
Well...

01:26.044 --> 01:28.046
Camille's still a little weird
about us.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.339
You know that's ridiculous.

01:29.422 --> 01:30.673
That's what I keep telling her,

01:30.757 --> 01:32.967
but for some reason,
she doesn't believe me.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.470
Here you go.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.514
Listen, I got to go.

01:38.598 --> 01:42.060
(quietly):
Bye.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.687
-KELLY: <i> I know what's going on.</i>
-MATT: <i> You do?</i>

01:44.771 --> 01:49.025
Why you've been
so distant lately.

01:49.108 --> 01:50.401
(sighs)

01:50.485 --> 01:51.986
-We should talk about it.
-Yeah.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.739
I-I've wanted to talk to you
for a long time,

01:54.823 --> 01:57.033
but I didn't know
how you would react.

01:57.116 --> 01:58.034
How I'd react?

01:58.117 --> 02:01.204
I should have told you
the truth right away.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.580
The truth about what?

02:02.664 --> 02:04.249
Your car.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.709
What about my car?

02:06.793 --> 02:08.877
You don't know?

02:08.961 --> 02:10.170
Know what?

02:10.255 --> 02:12.715
-While you were away...
-Yeah?

02:12.799 --> 02:15.134
I borrowed it, and I kind of

02:15.218 --> 02:17.095
sideswiped a parked car.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.722
Um, but... you know,
there's just a big dent

02:19.806 --> 02:22.350
on the... on the passenger side,
but I got a damage estimate.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.060
I know how things are
for you right now.

02:24.143 --> 02:25.436
Listen to me. Are you okay?

02:25.520 --> 02:27.689
-Yeah.
-Then, that's all that matters.

02:27.772 --> 02:29.065
Yeah, but your car...

02:29.149 --> 02:30.608
Who cares?
It has a few scratches.

02:30.692 --> 02:31.860
So what? Big deal.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.945
Who doesn't?

02:39.325 --> 02:41.244
Mmm.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.079
What was that for?

02:43.162 --> 02:45.874
Mmm, for being so smart

02:45.957 --> 02:49.836
and kind and understanding.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.049
If you didn't know
about your car,

02:55.133 --> 02:57.468
then why have you
been acting so weird lately?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.639
You know, work, money,
the usual crunch.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.811
Everything is going to be okay.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.646
Yeah, I hope so.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.774
It is. I promise.

03:18.656 --> 03:22.243
Kelly, I, um... I should
probably tell you, uh...

03:22.327 --> 03:23.703

We're dog-sitting.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.627
Georgia belongs
to Janet's parents.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.421
Disciplinarians,
they're not, honey.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.422
(laughter)

05:39.505 --> 05:41.466
Well, thank you so much
for having us over.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.301
-Oh, yeah.
-I think Otto over there

05:43.384 --> 05:45.136
is Maddy's very first crush.

05:45.219 --> 05:46.637
Oh! Ooh!

05:46.721 --> 05:48.639
Hey, you sure we can't
tempt you to stay

05:48.723 --> 05:50.141
with a mimosa, Bloody Mary?

05:50.224 --> 05:52.268
Well, thanks.
That is awfully tempting, but...

05:52.351 --> 05:53.853
we have an early deadline.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.646
Not at the <i> Chronicle.</i>
The editor,

05:55.730 --> 05:57.565
Oz Elliot,
is an old family friend.

05:57.648 --> 05:59.942
Booth's father won two Pulitzers
reporting for the <i> Times.</i>

06:01.194 --> 06:03.029
So, tell us,
what are you working on?

06:03.696 --> 06:04.864
Celebrity nose jobs.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.034
STEVE: Oh, you know what,
that reminds me.

06:08.117 --> 06:10.828
I forgot to show you
the before and after photos.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.122
Uh, we run the <i> Beverly Beat.</i>

06:13.206 --> 06:14.999
The tabloid.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.126
We like to think of it
as a niche publication.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.253
I'm sure you do.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.130
(Otto fussing)

06:21.214 --> 06:22.965
Honey, um, I think
Otto's a little hungry.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.467
So, um, thanks for coming.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.219
Bye-bye.

06:33.017 --> 06:35.186
NOAH:
<i>Ellen. Hey.</i>

06:36.229 --> 06:37.814
Ellen.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.745
Hey.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.039
You okay?

06:55.123 --> 06:56.040
(sniffling)

06:56.124 --> 06:58.042
I-I can't do this.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.252
No, you're just nervous.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.003
It's your first day. It's okay.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.172
He's gonna hate me.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.674
Oh, no, he's not gonna hate you.

07:04.757 --> 07:08.177
You're doing this guy
a big favor.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.512
Hey.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.513
He needs you.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.848
Oh, he needs me.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.015
Yeah, he needs you.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.017
(sighs)

07:15.101 --> 07:16.185
It's a real job.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.646
You know, no more temp work.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.148
I know you hate that.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.402
(sighs)

07:24.485 --> 07:26.195
Why are you doing this for me?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.197
'Cause I want to.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.867
Well, there's a lot of pressure
in that,

07:30.950 --> 07:32.493
you know? I-I mean,

07:32.577 --> 07:34.036
not wanting
to let you down, Noah.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.663
I'm not good with pressure.

07:35.746 --> 07:38.207
It's going to be okay.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.334
Really is.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.504
-Come on, let me drive you.
-Why?

07:43.588 --> 07:45.131
So I don't veer
into the nearest bar?

07:45.214 --> 07:46.883
Yeah.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.218
That, and to remind you
how special you are.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.721
'Cause you are.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.476
It's going to be all right.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.146
All right, come on.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.027
Thank you.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.737
You know what?

08:07.820 --> 08:09.864
I want us to start planning
our wedding.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.116
Okay.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.035
No, I'm serious.

08:14.118 --> 08:17.038
The way you dealt with me
smashing up your car

08:17.121 --> 08:19.373
reminded me of how lucky I am
to have you,

08:19.457 --> 08:21.417
and I want to get married
before you realize

08:21.500 --> 08:22.835
how much better you could do.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.088
Believe me, I am the lucky one.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.715
Mmm.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.218
Handsome attorney
who's not a dog.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.929
You could have
any girl you want.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.224
Weren't we talking
about the wedding?

08:36.307 --> 08:37.308
Mm-hmm.

08:37.390 --> 08:39.101
Hey, what's going on?

08:39.184 --> 08:40.352
Nothing.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.730
We were just talking about where
we're going to get married.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.106
I think it should
be in a church.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.483
DYLAN:
Oh, yeah, definitely.

08:45.566 --> 08:46.609
Definitely in a church.

08:46.692 --> 08:50.154
I mean, they got all that
religious stuff, and, uh,

08:50.238 --> 08:51.113
there's a...
there's a confessional

08:51.197 --> 08:53.574
halfway down the aisle.
It's a good idea.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.326
You would think of that.

08:55.409 --> 08:58.204
I think you guys
will be very happy.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.414
DYLAN:
I'll see you later.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.799
MAN:
<i>It's simple.</i>

09:09.882 --> 09:12.468
People log on the Internet,
view your stuff,

09:12.551 --> 09:13.302
point and click.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.929
CAMILLE:
It's like catalog shopping.

09:15.012 --> 09:16.847
Yeah, but much more
personalized.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.474
Say someone orders a dress.

09:18.557 --> 09:21.143
Any time they log on again,
they get sales information

09:21.227 --> 09:22.186
on that particular line.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.437
You can track that?

09:23.521 --> 09:24.814
If someone logs on three times

09:24.897 --> 09:25.982
but doesn't order anything,

09:26.065 --> 09:27.608
they automatically get
a sales incentive

09:27.692 --> 09:28.985
when they log on again.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.654
Well, that sounds great
once they log on,

09:31.737 --> 09:33.197
but everyone sells their stuff
on the Internet.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.782
How are people supposed
to find us?

09:34.865 --> 09:36.867
They can search for you
on their own,

09:36.951 --> 09:39.203
or you can advertise.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.998
-How expensive is that?
-It varies.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.625
I mean, you could spend
$35,000 a month

09:44.709 --> 09:47.211
for a banner ad
on a good search engine.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.338
-Or?
-Or... there's a little less--

09:49.422 --> 09:52.341
$1,500 a month for space
on a smaller Web site.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.509
The more you pay,

09:53.592 --> 09:54.844
the more hits you
are guaranteed.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.387
And if the advertising succeeds,

09:56.470 --> 09:58.639
then we have to be able
to deliver the product.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.183
MAN: Which means paying
for manufacturing,

10:01.267 --> 10:02.852
shipping, storage...

10:02.935 --> 10:04.854
Okay, but not before
we have any orders.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.022
DONNA:
Yeah, of course, before.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.648
If some girl orders a prom dress

10:07.732 --> 10:10.151
and it arrives three weeks
after the prom,

10:10.234 --> 10:12.028
-then we're through.
-CAMILLE: Donna,

10:12.111 --> 10:14.989
offline-- you sell to women
in Beverly Hills;

10:15.072 --> 10:16.365
online--

10:16.449 --> 10:18.326
you sell to the world.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.703
If they find us.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.538
If we pay for them to find us.

10:22.621 --> 10:25.207
If we pay to make the clothes
that they might not even buy.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.168
-It's so speculative. -Which is
why you shouldn't put up

10:27.251 --> 10:28.210
any of your own money.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.670
Luckily, people are dying

10:29.754 --> 10:31.213
to get in
on a good Internet investment.

10:31.297 --> 10:34.383
Well, if I'm not willing
to invest myself,

10:34.467 --> 10:36.218
I can't ask other people
to invest for me.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.679
Everybody does that.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.097
Well, not me.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.891
I'm sorry for your trouble,
Mitch.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.560
It's... just, I think the
Internet revolution's gonna have

10:44.644 --> 10:46.020
to go on without me.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.731
DONNA:
Sorry.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.364
I'm sorry,
Booth Gunderson is obnoxious.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.366
Why? Because he doesn't
like tabloids?

10:58.449 --> 11:00.076
You don't like tabloids.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.871
Yes, but I have a constructively
critical attitude.

11:03.954 --> 11:07.041
Calling your husband's ideas
moronic is not constructive.

11:07.124 --> 11:08.959
Wives can call
their husbands morons.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.961
Neighbors cannot.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.755
Besides, I can't believe
you're defending him.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.590
I don't like him
any more than you do.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.217
But, in case you forgot,
his daughter

11:16.300 --> 11:17.927
-goes to Carlthorp.
-So?

11:18.010 --> 11:21.097
So... it's a school we might
want Maddy to go to one day.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.390
Yeah, like, in six years.

11:22.473 --> 11:25.267
Do you know how hard it is to
get into a good private school?

11:25.351 --> 11:26.602
Booth's on the board
of directors;

11:26.685 --> 11:27.895
he could push it right through.

11:27.978 --> 11:29.730
Which is why,
no matter what happens,

11:29.814 --> 11:31.148
we stay on his good side.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.235
(screams)

11:34.318 --> 11:36.112
-What?!
-What is in her mouth?

11:37.154 --> 11:38.155
(growls softly)

11:38.697 --> 11:40.116
Oh, my God!

11:40.199 --> 11:41.200
It's Fluffy!

11:42.159 --> 11:43.119
She killed
the neighbors' rabbit.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.620
Along with Madeline's chances

11:44.703 --> 11:46.205
of getting into a good school.

11:54.713 --> 11:55.714
Give me that.

11:57.049 --> 11:57.967
Give, give.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.677
(Steve grunts)

11:59.760 --> 12:01.220
(sighs softly)

12:03.055 --> 12:05.683
(door closes)

12:12.690 --> 12:15.109
Hey, Dylan, can I talk to you?

12:15.192 --> 12:16.360
Yeah.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.321
All right, I have
a business proposition.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.240
You and everyone else.

12:21.323 --> 12:24.118
For an Internet company
I'm thinking about starting.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.164
My office, ten minutes.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.457
Great.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.916
Thanks.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.007
(door opens, closes)

12:38.090 --> 12:39.008
Hey.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.509
You a baseball fan? I know a guy

12:40.593 --> 12:42.011
who's got some Dodger tickets
tomorrow night.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.929
I figure, you know,
we go, have a good time.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.681
Nah, I'll pass.

12:45.764 --> 12:48.100
Little early for you, isn't it?

12:48.184 --> 12:50.019
What, this?

12:50.102 --> 12:51.020
Water.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.022
Mmm.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.273
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

12:55.274 --> 12:57.151
No, I'm not.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.986
You know, she'll leave me

12:59.069 --> 13:01.030
if I tell her
I slept with someone else.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.325
You don't know that.

13:04.408 --> 13:05.910
You're saying she won't?

13:05.993 --> 13:07.703
No.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.000
(sighs heavily)

13:13.083 --> 13:14.251
What should I do?

13:16.128 --> 13:17.046
(sighs)

13:17.129 --> 13:18.589
I can't tell you what to do.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.549
What would you do?

13:22.593 --> 13:24.762
You're not me.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.681
You wouldn't tell her,
would you?

13:27.765 --> 13:30.059
Never.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.407
Okay, so it's not the church
I grew up in,

13:45.491 --> 13:46.575
but a lot of people say

13:46.659 --> 13:48.118
that this minister is fantastic.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.411
Seemed cold.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.412
Yeah, well, it was empty.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.580
It just needs some flowers.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.290
Yeah.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.584
I think we should
at least meet with him.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.962
Don't you think getting married
by someone neither of us knows

13:58.045 --> 13:59.421
is kind of impersonal?

13:59.505 --> 14:02.883
Mmm... hey, what about
that judge you clerked for?

14:02.967 --> 14:03.884
What was his name?

14:03.968 --> 14:04.885
Judge Sinclair?

14:04.969 --> 14:06.595
Yeah, Judge Sinclair.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.596
What about him?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.098
I mean, he could
perform the vows

14:09.181 --> 14:10.099
wherever we have the ceremony.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.225
Mmm, I don't know.

14:11.308 --> 14:12.601
I think he would be great.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.104
You're always talking
about how thoughtful he is

14:15.187 --> 14:17.106
and how honest.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.108
I don't know. He's a busy man.
(clears throat)

14:19.191 --> 14:20.067
Wouldn't hurt to ask.

14:20.150 --> 14:23.654
I just don't think he'd do it.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.114
What is going on?

14:25.197 --> 14:27.116
Nothing. I just don't want
to inconvenience him.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.450
(sighs)

14:28.534 --> 14:32.580
I don't think that he would see
our wedding as an inconvenience.

14:32.663 --> 14:33.914
All right, whatever. Can we
just think of someone else?

14:34.999 --> 14:37.668
I know you have a lot
on your mind,

14:37.751 --> 14:39.169
but planning our wedding
should be a joy.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.796
And if your work
or whatever it is

14:40.879 --> 14:41.797
that's making you so distant...

14:41.880 --> 14:43.257
My work. It's my work.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.009
If it's keeping you
from enjoying this,

14:45.092 --> 14:48.762
then you need to deal with it.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.645
What did you think of Mitch?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.188
Uh, Mitch was great.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.982
His ideas were terrifying.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.692
So, what,
you're not gonna do it?

15:03.736 --> 15:06.030
Did you see that woman
that was in here?

15:06.113 --> 15:08.157
Well, she came in,
she looked around,

15:08.240 --> 15:10.034
she found a dress she liked,
and she bought it.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.660
That works for me.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.496
You're in the Stone Age,
you realize that?

15:14.580 --> 15:15.664
Thanks.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.167
But at least
I'm turning a profit.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.002
I want to keep it that way.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.047
Camille's so much better
at this pitch than me.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.506
-Uh, where is she?
-I don't know.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.508
She went to lunch, like,
four hours ago.

15:26.592 --> 15:27.509
And here she comes.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.345
Perfect. You're both here.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.387
Maybe you should tell them.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.890
-Uh... -I think
you're really gonna love this.

15:32.973 --> 15:33.891
I'm in.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.017
You're in what?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.226
DonnaMartinOriginals.com.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.519
He's gonna invest.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.730
You know, I've heard
a lot of ideas lately,

15:39.813 --> 15:42.024
but hers was, uh, pretty good.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.525
Hers?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.194
Oh, mine, yours, whatever.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.029
We've been brainstorming
all afternoon.

15:48.238 --> 15:49.740
Well, I'm sorry,
but like I told Camille,

15:49.823 --> 15:51.909
I'm really not comfortable
with people investing right now.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.495
Listen, Donna, come here.

15:54.578 --> 15:57.164
You and I-- we'll go out to
dinner, and we'll talk about it.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.540
And if you still feel
like it's something

15:58.624 --> 16:01.543
you don't want to do,
then we won't, okay?

16:01.627 --> 16:03.003
Fine. Sounds fair.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.089
Weren't we supposed to be
having lunch today?

16:07.132 --> 16:09.885
Oh, David, I'm so sorry.

16:09.968 --> 16:12.388
I totally forgot.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.098
But isn't this exciting?

16:14.181 --> 16:15.557
Yeah, yeah, it is.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.227
It's... it's great.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.396
Okay, so what's the deal?

16:20.479 --> 16:22.064
Dinner? I'm coming?

16:22.147 --> 16:25.442
-DONNA: And we'll talk about it.
-CAMILLE: Okay.

16:27.611 --> 16:30.364
The Gundersons haven't been
in their yard all afternoon.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.116
Oh, that's a load off.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.243
Beat it, rabbit breath.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.580
Honey.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.374
Have you been in a tree?

16:40.457 --> 16:41.917
Yeah, briefly.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.919
Gives me a better view
into the neighbors' backyard.

16:44.002 --> 16:46.088
Okay, we're telling them
the truth.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.090
That their beloved bunny
was savagely murdered?

16:48.173 --> 16:49.758
How can you be so cruel?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.510
Still in full suck-up mode,
I see.

16:51.593 --> 16:54.096
It's called being
child-centered, okay?

16:54.179 --> 16:54.930
Those kids loved Fluffy.

16:55.013 --> 16:57.808
Kids deal with death
all the time.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.268
Have you seen Bambi recently?

17:00.352 --> 17:01.979
(laughs):
Oh, thank you, thank you!

17:02.062 --> 17:03.021
That's it, that's it!

17:03.105 --> 17:05.190
The Petersons have a Rottweiler.

17:05.273 --> 17:06.567
We take the rabbit,
and we throw it

17:06.650 --> 17:07.901
into their yard,
and blame it on them!

17:07.984 --> 17:09.111
Steve.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.279
What, what?!
I need time to think!

17:10.362 --> 17:12.281
This is terrible! God!

17:12.364 --> 17:14.782
Do you think maybe we could
take the berdog to the pound

17:14.867 --> 17:15.909
while I'm thinking
about this, please?

17:15.992 --> 17:16.993
Watch it.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.494
I'm the one
who picked Georgia out

17:18.579 --> 17:19.788
at the pet store.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.290
We've had her since I was 15.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.001
Huh?

17:24.084 --> 17:25.961
That's it.

17:26.044 --> 17:26.962
What?

17:27.045 --> 17:28.464
You are a genius. Come with me.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.132
-Where are we going?
-We're going to secure

17:30.215 --> 17:31.008
our daughter's
educational future!

17:31.091 --> 17:33.135
-Come on!
-(dog barks)

17:34.261 --> 17:35.929
MITCH:
<i>That's it. Advertising,</i>

17:36.013 --> 17:37.848
Web site design production.
That's my pitch.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.142
This could be huge.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.477
Or not.

17:43.771 --> 17:44.938
How many times have you

17:45.022 --> 17:46.273
begged department stores
to sell your stuff

17:46.356 --> 17:48.025
because you wanted
a bigger market?

17:48.108 --> 17:49.943
This gives you one.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.112
(chuckles)
Maybe.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.656
Weren't you loving this idea
earlier today?

17:54.740 --> 17:57.117
Yeah.

17:57.201 --> 18:01.079
Now I see more reasons
to be... cautious.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.168
You have a big decision to make.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.586
I'll let you make it.

18:09.087 --> 18:12.341
Would you excuse me, please?

18:15.260 --> 18:18.180
It's your call, Don, but, uh...

18:18.263 --> 18:21.225
if I were you,
I'd probably do it.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.190
You know this is all your fault.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.525
Hey, I'm just the messenger.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.527
Well, if your pitch
hadn't been so effective,

18:31.610 --> 18:33.320
this might be easier
to walk away from.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.489
Thanks, I think.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.032
(laughs)

18:37.115 --> 18:40.160
You're just...
you're very persuasive.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.162
-Really?
-Yeah. (laughs)

18:43.163 --> 18:46.125
Can I persuade you to have
dinner with me tomorrow?

18:51.463 --> 18:53.215
That's why you're in
such a bad mood?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.049
Because I went to Dylan?

18:54.132 --> 18:56.343
No! It's not
that you went to Dylan.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.179
It's that you went to anyone
after Donna asked you not to.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.723
I only own a small piece
of the store,

19:01.807 --> 19:03.183
but I do deserve some say.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.768
Some, Camille, some.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.228
Not all. I...

19:06.311 --> 19:07.229
(chuckles)

19:07.312 --> 19:09.690
Donna and I disagree,
and you side with her.

19:09.773 --> 19:10.899
Why am I not surprised?

19:10.983 --> 19:11.817
Everything good?

19:11.900 --> 19:13.193
Dylan, could you
give us a minute, please?

19:13.277 --> 19:14.361
Hey, what did Donna say?

19:14.444 --> 19:15.946
Uh, she's in there
thinking about it.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.155
I'm, uh... I'm going.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.252
(knocking)

19:30.335 --> 19:31.044
Yeah?

19:31.128 --> 19:33.088
(chatter, gunfire
playing over TV)

19:33.172 --> 19:34.381
I'm coming.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.054
(sighs)

19:50.063 --> 19:50.981
Hi.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.983
Did I wake you?

19:53.066 --> 19:54.109
No.

19:54.192 --> 19:55.777
What time is it?

19:55.861 --> 19:57.195
I, uh... I don't know.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.447
Oh, this was a bad idea.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.240
Hey, hey, wait.
Uh, come on in.

20:00.324 --> 20:03.327
I-I was... I was just getting
ready to order some coffee.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.208
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.209
(line rings)

20:11.293 --> 20:13.420
You want to send up some coffee,
please, for two?

20:13.503 --> 20:14.671
Thanks.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.926
I want to keep
my private life private.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.969
So why are you here?

20:21.053 --> 20:24.640
Did anything happen
when you and Matt went away?

20:24.723 --> 20:26.600
Went riding, you know.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.268
We camped out,
met some fellow travelers.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.478
No big deal.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.648
I mean, did anything happen
with Matt?

20:32.731 --> 20:34.316
I know what you mean.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.984
And?

20:36.068 --> 20:38.612
No. Nothing happened.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.197
That was a little quick.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.115
It's because nothing happened.

20:44.117 --> 20:46.161
Okay.

20:46.244 --> 20:48.830
Listen, just...
go on back to Matt.

20:48.914 --> 20:49.831
(clears throat)

20:49.915 --> 20:52.501
He's the one you're gonna be...

20:52.584 --> 20:54.878
disgustingly happy with.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.338
Thanks.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.048
Yeah.

21:13.271 --> 21:15.857
STEVE:
You annoy me.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.485
That's right,
I'm talking to you.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.195
(grunts)

21:20.278 --> 21:24.908
Seven pet shops, not one
black spotted bunny to be found.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.077
Shoe polish doesn't work,
paint looks ridiculous.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.412
Are you listening to me?

21:28.495 --> 21:30.038
Were you in the tree again
this morning?

21:30.122 --> 21:32.124
-Yeah.
-Then I'm not listening.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.838
We really just need
to tell them the truth, okay?

21:37.921 --> 21:39.131
Hair dye.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.132
What?

21:40.215 --> 21:41.550
Watch the rabbit.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.093
-Where you going?
-I'm going to the drugstore.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.720
Do you need anything?

21:44.803 --> 21:47.889
Honey, we should probably
just talk about this, okay?

21:47.973 --> 21:49.349
And we will, in great detail.

21:49.433 --> 21:52.352
Just as soon as I bring Fluffy
back from the dead.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.187
(laughs)

21:56.815 --> 21:59.151
(door opens, closes)

22:00.444 --> 22:02.404
DONNA:
<i>Morning.</i>

22:02.487 --> 22:04.197
-Hey.
-Oh, uh...

22:04.281 --> 22:07.117
Pastor Talbert and
two catering companies called.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.578
They wanted to know
if I'd set a date.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.246
So, have I set a date?

22:11.329 --> 22:13.373
No, but you're getting serious.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.708
At least I am.

22:14.791 --> 22:15.751
Anything I can do?

22:15.834 --> 22:18.211
Design the dress,
be my maid of honor. The usual.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.088
I'd be honored.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.590
No matter how many times
you ask.

22:21.673 --> 22:24.301
Can we talk specifics
after work?

22:24.384 --> 22:26.136
Oh, um, guess what.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.429
I have a date.

22:27.512 --> 22:28.221
That's great.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.098
-Who with?
-Uh, this guy, Mitch.

22:30.182 --> 22:30.974
Someone David brought in

22:31.058 --> 22:34.102
to explain how
to get the store online.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.063
You're going out with a friend
of David's?

22:36.146 --> 22:37.439
Yeah.

22:37.522 --> 22:38.732
Well, what's wrong with that?

22:38.815 --> 22:39.900
Oh, nothing.

22:39.983 --> 22:42.444
Just that when you're going out
with a friend of the guy

22:42.527 --> 22:44.946
you really want to date,
usually ends in disaster.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.448
Oh, no, no, no.

22:46.531 --> 22:49.242
See, disaster strikes
when I date someone who's cute,

22:49.326 --> 22:50.368
funny or successful.

22:50.452 --> 22:53.455
This guy's all three,
so it's sure to crash and burn.

22:53.538 --> 22:56.291
And besides,
David's unavailable.

22:56.375 --> 23:00.003
Maybe he would be if you'd
ever tell him how you feel.

23:00.087 --> 23:03.131
-(groans)
-(knocking)

23:03.215 --> 23:04.925
Camille, hi.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.968
Donna, I owe you an apology.

23:08.011 --> 23:09.763
I'll see you later.

23:12.265 --> 23:15.143
Going behind your back
to Dylan was wrong.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.979
Yeah, it was, but actually,
I'm glad you did it.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.439
You are?

23:19.523 --> 23:21.858
Yeah, I've decided
to take Dylan up on his offer.

23:21.942 --> 23:23.777
-You have?
-Mm-hmm.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.362
Oh, Donna, I'm so glad.

23:25.445 --> 23:27.906
Does this mean that everything's
okay between us?

23:27.989 --> 23:30.951
Because your friendship means
a lot more to me

23:31.034 --> 23:33.161
(chuckling) than the tons
of money we're about to make.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.163
No, I'm kidding.
It means a lot to me.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.207
Me, too.

23:39.459 --> 23:40.877
Come on. Let's get to work.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.546
Okay.

23:45.423 --> 23:47.134
Hey, Matt.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.636
Kelly came to see me last night.

23:49.719 --> 23:51.346
She did? What happened?

23:51.429 --> 23:53.723
She was asking a lot
of questions about the trip.

23:53.807 --> 23:56.017
Well, what did you tell her?

23:56.101 --> 23:56.852
Nothing.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.854
Well, what'd she ask?
Be specific.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.189
She sensed that something's
wrong with you,

24:01.273 --> 24:02.190
so she's concerned.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.608
And you told her
nothing happened.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.735
That's right. I lied.

24:05.819 --> 24:08.363
Oy, I got to tell her.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.031
You sure do.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.158
What are you talking about?
You're the one

24:11.241 --> 24:12.367
who told me not to tell her.

24:12.450 --> 24:13.285
Yeah, that's before
I knew you'd

24:13.368 --> 24:15.078
walk around
looking like a war criminal.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.205
Yeah, well, I feel guilty,
all right? I can't help that.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.290
Feeling guilty is one thing.

24:18.373 --> 24:20.667
Looking guilty is something
entirely different.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.210
Now, if Kelly sees you sweating,

24:22.294 --> 24:23.670
then she's going
to figure it out.

24:23.753 --> 24:26.089
That's the only thing worse
than you telling her.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.632
Don't let that happen.

24:38.059 --> 24:40.061
JANET (hushed): You know
this is grounds for divorce.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.397
Shh! Quiet!

24:42.480 --> 24:44.524
You know what to do?

24:44.608 --> 24:48.862
Sure. Once you trespass,
I hand the cage down to you,

24:48.945 --> 24:51.239
thereby becoming an accessory

24:51.323 --> 24:53.241
after the fact.
And then I watch to make sure

24:53.325 --> 24:55.410
that no one sees you make
a complete fool of yourself.

24:55.493 --> 24:58.246
-Okay. And if you see someone?
-I can't say it.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.581
Oh, come on!
That's the most important part!

24:59.664 --> 25:01.500
I hoot like an owl.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.421
You're the best.

25:08.381 --> 25:11.134
Careful!

25:11.218 --> 25:12.636
(sighs) Oh, God.

25:12.719 --> 25:14.012
(grunts)

25:17.182 --> 25:18.308
Okay, give me the rabbit.

25:18.391 --> 25:20.352
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay! I'm okay!

25:20.435 --> 25:21.645
-Give me the bunny!
-Okay!

25:21.728 --> 25:23.396
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on!

25:23.480 --> 25:24.439
JANET:
Whoo. Whoo.

25:24.522 --> 25:27.025
(Steve spitting)

25:32.030 --> 25:33.323
-Whoops!
-(Steve gasps)

25:34.908 --> 25:37.118
Steve! Steve, come back!

25:43.708 --> 25:46.962
BOOTH: I didn't say Maddy
wasn't an attractive child.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.464
I just said I think Otto
seems more advanced.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.967
Well, Maddy does seem
a bit slow,

25:52.050 --> 25:55.136
but, well, now, Booth, honey,
how can any baby compare

25:55.220 --> 25:56.221
to our sweet little pumpkin?

25:56.304 --> 25:58.765
Especially when you factor in
who her parents are.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.517
There is nothing Maddy

26:00.600 --> 26:02.686
-can do about her genes.
-No. (chuckles)

26:02.769 --> 26:04.479
(gasps)

26:04.562 --> 26:07.232
(hooting)

26:12.737 --> 26:14.197
Steve, look, look!

26:14.281 --> 26:16.950
I can't believe what I just saw.

26:17.033 --> 26:19.160
-Neither can I.
-(cage clatters)

26:19.244 --> 26:21.329
Did you hear something?

26:23.748 --> 26:25.125
Shh.

26:31.464 --> 26:34.217
(funky rock playing)

26:44.144 --> 26:46.021
David's next, you know?

26:46.104 --> 26:48.023
Next for what?

26:48.106 --> 26:49.024
Getting on the Internet.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.692
Do you ever stop?

26:50.775 --> 26:52.152
Hey, the...
the Web grows by more

26:52.235 --> 26:54.154
than a hundred radio stations
every month.

26:54.237 --> 26:57.324
Already, you can listen
to a Brazilian Top 40 station

26:57.407 --> 27:00.035
or international news
directly from China.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.662
Why not David Silver live
from the After Dark?

27:02.746 --> 27:05.040
Not a bad idea.

27:05.123 --> 27:08.209
So what's it like
to be a true believer?

27:08.293 --> 27:09.878
It's great.

27:09.961 --> 27:13.506
Especially when you have
so much to believe in.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.725
Hey. That was a good...
good show tonight.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.101
You know, you and Camille,

27:25.185 --> 27:26.186
you're gonna need, uh,
some good ideas

27:26.269 --> 27:28.229
to justify all the brainstorming
you've been doing.

27:28.313 --> 27:31.566
Now, that is just
a business investment.

27:31.649 --> 27:34.235
-Strictly business.
-That's good.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.121
Hey there, gorgeous.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.081
Hey.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.916
How was work?

27:47.999 --> 27:50.085
Oh, fabulous, fabulous.

27:50.168 --> 27:54.464
I, uh, set a new record for the
most screw-ups in a single day.

27:54.547 --> 27:57.092
(chuckling): Okay,
what are you talking about?

27:57.175 --> 27:59.969
Well, first, the Buddhist temple
orders mint tea

28:00.053 --> 28:02.430
and they get soda, and, uh,

28:02.514 --> 28:04.057
then the blues club orders soda

28:04.140 --> 28:06.768
and they get mint tea. Uh-oh.

28:06.851 --> 28:07.936
Hey, look, it's okay.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.229
We'll talk about it
some other time.

28:09.312 --> 28:11.106
I wasn't ready for this, Noah.
I told you that.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.608
-I...
-But you knew better.

28:13.691 --> 28:16.236
I knew better, right.
Okay, let's go.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.237
I'll save you the trouble.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.114
I'm already gone.

28:24.702 --> 28:29.290
♪ ♪

28:41.010 --> 28:42.262
-Hi.
-Hi.

28:42.345 --> 28:43.304
I was just, uh...

28:43.388 --> 28:44.222
Yeah, I know.

28:44.305 --> 28:45.974
I was watching you
through the window.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.016
Oh, that's embarrassing.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.102
So are you coming or going?

28:49.185 --> 28:50.186
Right, right.

28:50.270 --> 28:54.649
Um, look, a couple things
did happen at the desert

28:54.732 --> 28:56.151
that I didn't tell you about.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.903
Really? Like what?

28:58.987 --> 29:00.864
Um, well, to begin with,

29:00.947 --> 29:03.116
uh, there was this punch.

29:03.199 --> 29:05.160
Punch in the desert?

29:05.243 --> 29:06.327
At a party.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.496
Rave. Whatever.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.498
Um, and it was spiked.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.334
The punch was spiked.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.129
With acid.

29:16.212 --> 29:19.507
So you're telling me
that you dropped acid?

29:19.591 --> 29:21.217
(chuckles)
No, I'm telling you

29:21.301 --> 29:25.013
that I drank punch
that was spiked with acid.

29:26.055 --> 29:28.224
Right.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.477
What else?

29:30.560 --> 29:31.728
What do you mean,
what-what else?

29:31.811 --> 29:34.147
You said there were a couple
of things.

29:34.230 --> 29:35.815
And you started
with the dropping acid.

29:35.899 --> 29:37.859
And I just can't wait
to find out what's next.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.820
I did not drop acid, okay?

29:42.113 --> 29:43.490
Whatever.

29:43.573 --> 29:44.866
What else?

29:44.949 --> 29:48.077
Well, actually, that was...
that was it.

29:49.329 --> 29:52.457
You've been acting distant
lately

29:52.540 --> 29:54.667
because you drank spiked punch?

29:54.751 --> 29:58.046
No, it was... it was keeping
a secret from you

29:58.129 --> 29:59.714
that bothered me.

29:59.797 --> 30:02.008
But now that I told you,
I feel so much better.

30:02.091 --> 30:03.218
-Hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.010
And if you saw

30:04.093 --> 30:06.179
how stupendously idiotic
I acted...

30:06.262 --> 30:07.180
(groans)

30:07.263 --> 30:07.931
I don't believe you.

30:08.014 --> 30:10.725
No, I <i> was</i> a complete fool.

30:10.808 --> 30:13.895
No, I mean I don't believe
your story

30:13.978 --> 30:16.940
because the way
you've been acting

30:17.023 --> 30:19.400
doesn't match up
with what you say you did.

30:19.484 --> 30:22.028
So I'd like you
to tell me the truth now.

30:22.111 --> 30:24.906
-I just told you the truth.
-You told me the truth?

30:24.989 --> 30:27.242
(laughs nervously)
I don't believe this.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.869
You've been after me all week
about what's been going on,

30:29.953 --> 30:31.788
and now that you know,
it's not good enough.

30:32.830 --> 30:34.916
I'm just telling you how I feel.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.252
Well, here's how I feel--
like I'm being honest with you

30:37.335 --> 30:38.753
about something I did that I'm

30:38.836 --> 30:40.713
not exactly proud of, and you're
just more upset than ever.

30:40.797 --> 30:43.258
I mean... there's no winning
with you.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.651
(door opens)

31:01.734 --> 31:02.944
NOAH:
<i>Morning.</i>

31:03.027 --> 31:05.947
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.824
So I talked to Ben.

31:07.907 --> 31:09.993
He said mix-ups happen
all the time.

31:10.076 --> 31:11.744
I told him you'd be in today

31:11.828 --> 31:13.162
a little bit late.
He said okay.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.207
We should still hurry up,
though.

31:19.335 --> 31:21.212
I'm not going back.

31:21.296 --> 31:22.130
Did you hear what I said?

31:22.213 --> 31:23.256
He thought you were great.

31:23.339 --> 31:25.049
I told you
I don't like pressure.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.342
Ah, come on. You did good.

31:26.426 --> 31:29.137
I don't want pressure.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.471
Okay?

31:30.555 --> 31:32.473
I-I-I can't handle it.
I buckle under it.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.183
I totally fall apart.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.768
We both do. That's why we drink.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.229
That's how we could both
help each other out.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.982
I don't...
I don't want your help.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.196
It's about last night, right?

31:47.280 --> 31:49.157
Listen, it happens all the time.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.700
-Just listen.
-You know...

31:50.783 --> 31:52.160
know what you need?

31:52.243 --> 31:54.162
I'm going to call Ben right now
and tell him you need

31:54.245 --> 31:55.038
one more day, and that's it.

31:55.121 --> 31:57.248
Just please stop it!

31:57.332 --> 31:59.709
Stop trying to give me
this normal life

31:59.792 --> 32:01.961
and a normal job
and a normal boyfriend.

32:02.045 --> 32:02.962
Just stop.

32:03.046 --> 32:04.505
Uh-uh.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.007
I can't, okay?

32:06.090 --> 32:08.134
If we're going to be together,
I can't.

32:10.094 --> 32:12.805
Well, then, I guess
we're not going to be together.

32:25.693 --> 32:28.196
Hey. Everybody's downstairs
waiting on you,

32:28.279 --> 32:30.198
ready to celebrate.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.367
You know, if this
Internet thing goes through,

32:32.450 --> 32:34.202
probably gonna need
a good lawyer.

32:34.285 --> 32:35.912
Know anybody like that?

32:36.954 --> 32:38.873
Tell me,
when Kelly and I break up,

32:38.956 --> 32:41.209
will there be a grace period,
or will you offer

32:41.292 --> 32:42.752
the Caribbean vacation
right away?

32:42.835 --> 32:45.213
I don't want that to happen.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.215
Because we're pals.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.133
No, not 'cause we're pals.

32:49.217 --> 32:51.386
'Cause I don't want
to see her get hurt.

32:51.469 --> 32:54.180
She's yours to lose.

32:54.263 --> 32:57.475
And if you do, you got no one
to blame but yourself.

33:09.570 --> 33:11.072
Excuse me.

33:11.155 --> 33:13.032
Okay.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.124
You think I'm making
a mistake, don't you?

33:22.333 --> 33:24.127
Tell me about the one that...

33:24.210 --> 33:26.129
I just didn't like seeing you
get pressured, that's all.

33:26.212 --> 33:28.673
Well, maybe
that's what I needed.

33:28.756 --> 33:31.467
Not to mention a great fix-up.

33:31.551 --> 33:35.304
Yeah. Yeah, you two
could be good together.

33:36.055 --> 33:38.683
Kind of like you and Camille.

33:38.766 --> 33:41.185
I'd aim higher if I were you.

33:41.269 --> 33:43.104
Why? What's wrong?

33:44.147 --> 33:46.107
She's the one who pressured you.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.776
Look, I... I don't want
to be the reason

33:48.860 --> 33:50.403
you guys aren't getting along.

33:50.486 --> 33:52.113
A reason.

33:52.196 --> 33:54.699
Donna, believe me,
there's a few.

33:54.782 --> 33:56.951
Hey, all right.

33:57.034 --> 33:58.077
(laughs)
Oh, hey.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.121
I figured it might
liven things up.

34:00.204 --> 34:01.122
CAMILLE:
Okay.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.248
DYLAN:
Hey, you two--

34:02.331 --> 34:04.125
come on over here.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.043
We should, um...

34:13.009 --> 34:15.011
All right.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.638
Okay, so I propose a toast...

34:17.722 --> 34:19.264
Ah!

34:19.348 --> 34:21.476
-CAMILLE: Okay.
-That's the stuff.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.351
All right, brains,

34:23.436 --> 34:25.103
beauty, intelligence...

34:25.188 --> 34:26.481
Deep pockets?

34:26.563 --> 34:27.607
Doesn't hurt.

34:27.690 --> 34:31.027
And a fabulous idea.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.280
Look out, America.

34:34.362 --> 34:36.239
You're gonna do great.

34:39.409 --> 34:40.828
Hey.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.455
This is a good thing, man.

34:42.538 --> 34:43.664
You should be happy.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.000
Yeah, you're right. I should.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.668
-And you, you kook, come here.
-(Camille gasps)

34:48.753 --> 34:50.170
-This is all your fault.
-CAMILLE: Oh, no.

34:50.254 --> 34:52.380
Make me a rich man.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.300
Yeah, me, too.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.978
Whatever happens,
I owe you both a big apology.

35:06.062 --> 35:07.522
I behaved like an idiot.

35:07.605 --> 35:09.065
Is that enough of an apology?

35:09.148 --> 35:10.358
-(Madeline cooing)
-I didn't think so, either.

35:10.441 --> 35:12.485
Maddy's not going to need
the help of a guy

35:12.568 --> 35:14.529
like Booth Gunderson
to accomplish great things.

35:14.612 --> 35:15.780
-Come on.
-And?

35:15.863 --> 35:16.906
And my desire for her

35:16.989 --> 35:19.283
to have the best of everything
blinded me to the fact

35:19.367 --> 35:21.202
that he is a pompous windbag.

35:21.285 --> 35:22.829
What do you think, Maddy?

35:22.912 --> 35:24.330
Have we put Daddy
through enough?

35:24.413 --> 35:25.706
Oh, she drooled.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.500
-I think that means
you're off the hook. -Oh, good.

35:27.583 --> 35:30.169
Only if we tell them the truth.

35:30.253 --> 35:32.046
-Okay?
-Absolutely.

35:32.129 --> 35:35.049
CHILD:
Oh, wow, it's Fluffy!

35:37.301 --> 35:39.345
What? What is it?

35:39.428 --> 35:41.097
Uh, is-is there something wrong
with Fluffy?

35:41.180 --> 35:43.391
JUNE:
No, and that's what's so odd.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.434
It's odd there's nothing wrong
with Fluffy?

35:45.518 --> 35:47.895
-Yes, considering she died
Friday. -You know she died?

35:47.979 --> 35:49.856
-Yes.
-Of course we know.

35:49.939 --> 35:52.024
She choked on a carrot
right in front of us.

35:52.108 --> 35:53.234
Yeah, we buried her
in the flower bed,

35:53.317 --> 35:55.319
and now here she is.

35:58.614 --> 36:00.575
Georgia didn't kill
that stinking bunny!

36:00.658 --> 36:03.619
That means that she
just dug it up.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.830
-Wh-which-which means...
-That's impossible.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.046
She's gone.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.257
Risen from the dead on Easter?

36:16.340 --> 36:17.758
Cool!

36:17.842 --> 36:19.635
Holy hare!

36:19.719 --> 36:21.429
Easter Bunny rises
from the grave.

36:21.512 --> 36:23.097
That sounds
like a lead story, honey.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.433
Oh, yeah. Tell me, Booth.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.643
Is there an "E"
at the end of Booth?

36:27.727 --> 36:30.062
Because at the <i> Beat,</i>
we're sticklers for accuracy.

36:30.146 --> 36:32.148
(Booth laughs)

36:38.529 --> 36:39.906
(laughing)

36:47.038 --> 36:48.331
Hi.

36:48.414 --> 36:50.583
Hey.

36:50.666 --> 36:52.168
This seat taken?

36:52.251 --> 36:53.669
No. No. Sit down.

36:53.753 --> 36:56.005
Thanks.

36:56.088 --> 36:59.008
So, what did you decide on
with the Internet thing?

36:59.091 --> 37:00.468
(Donna sighs)

37:00.551 --> 37:02.178
I'm going online.

37:02.261 --> 37:04.221
Thanks for the encouragement.

37:04.305 --> 37:06.641
(laughs)
Yeah, I'm a real pro

37:06.724 --> 37:08.726
at telling other people
what they should do.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.312
(sighs)

37:11.395 --> 37:13.022
When I started drinking again,

37:13.105 --> 37:15.274
I thought
it was 'cause we broke up.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.819
I mean, I-I didn't exactly
blame you, but...

37:18.903 --> 37:20.154
But you blame me, I know.

37:20.237 --> 37:22.114
I thought
you were supposed to save me.

37:22.198 --> 37:24.241
When you didn't, it...

37:25.910 --> 37:27.828
...made me realize
I got to save myself.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.121
And you did.

37:29.205 --> 37:31.082
(quietly):
Yeah.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.585
Let's hope Ellen realizes
the same thing.

37:35.586 --> 37:37.838
Where is she?

37:38.881 --> 37:40.257
I don't know.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.137
Look, you did all you could
for her.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.557
The rest she has to do
for herself.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.268
What if she can't?

38:06.617 --> 38:08.327
Hey.

38:09.328 --> 38:10.705
Are you coming to bed?

38:10.788 --> 38:12.039
I'm gonna read for a while.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.833
You can read in here.

38:13.916 --> 38:17.169
Yeah, and, I'll...
I'll be in later, all right?

38:19.463 --> 38:21.465
(sighs)

38:27.096 --> 38:28.889
Did I miss something,

38:28.973 --> 38:30.850
or did my going
behind Donna's back

38:30.933 --> 38:32.059
work out for the best?

38:32.143 --> 38:34.395
She's happy about it.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.063
Then, why aren't you?

38:36.147 --> 38:39.525
It was never what
I was upset about to begin with.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.444
You said it was.

38:41.527 --> 38:44.238
Well, now I'm telling you
it's not.

38:44.321 --> 38:46.574
Camille, I was never even
upset with you. It's just Dylan.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.075
What did Dylan do?

38:48.159 --> 38:49.577
Same thing he always does.

38:49.660 --> 38:50.786
He hovers.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.079
He makes himself available.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.707
He acts mysteriously nocturnal.

38:54.790 --> 38:57.752
Dylan and me-- is that
what you're talking about?

39:01.380 --> 39:03.049
David, I don't deserve this.

39:03.132 --> 39:05.092
I'm not saying you do.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.137
I'm just telling you how I feel.

39:08.220 --> 39:09.472
You know what?

39:09.555 --> 39:11.932
Considering the way
you expect me

39:12.016 --> 39:15.102
to just simply accept whatever
it is you and Donna either

39:15.186 --> 39:17.104
have or don't have going on,

39:17.188 --> 39:19.440
the idea
that you would say anything

39:19.523 --> 39:21.108
about the nonexistent
relationship

39:21.192 --> 39:22.610
I have with Dylan
is unbelievable.

39:22.693 --> 39:25.071
You don't understand
the history I have with him.

39:25.154 --> 39:27.239
I-I don't care what it is.

39:27.323 --> 39:29.575
Dylan's my friend,
and if this business works out,

39:29.658 --> 39:32.244
we're going to be spending
more and more time together.

39:32.328 --> 39:34.288
-What if it bothers me?
-There's no reason why

39:34.371 --> 39:35.456
-it should.
-But what if it does?

39:35.539 --> 39:37.124
(sighs)

39:37.208 --> 39:39.919
That's your problem, David,
not ours.

39:43.881 --> 39:45.091
Well, I'm gonna go to bed.

39:54.308 --> 39:56.268
(knocking)

39:58.229 --> 39:59.855
There you are.
I've been looking for you.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.941
Hi. Yeah, I got your messages.

40:02.024 --> 40:05.402
I just, um,
needed some time to think.

40:06.403 --> 40:07.988
I know. Me, too, and, uh...

40:08.072 --> 40:09.824
and there's something
I want to say.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.200
Before you say it,

40:11.283 --> 40:14.328
I just want to tell you
that I'm sorry.

40:14.411 --> 40:16.497
-Kelly, listen to me.
-Last night, you were trying

40:16.580 --> 40:19.125
to be honest with me,
and I reacted terribly.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.168
Will you just hold on
one second and listen to me?

40:21.252 --> 40:23.170
But what's worse yet
is that I didn't make you feel

40:23.254 --> 40:25.047
safe enough to come and tell me
the truth in the first place.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.715
But it is not your fault.

40:26.799 --> 40:28.717
You are the most honest person
I know,

40:28.801 --> 40:31.679
and-and if you're not
comfortable being open with me,

40:31.762 --> 40:33.681
then I must be doing
something wrong.

40:33.764 --> 40:35.141
You are not doing
anything wrong.

40:35.224 --> 40:35.933
No, I'm serious.

40:36.016 --> 40:38.394
I can be harsh
and-and judgmental

40:38.477 --> 40:41.021
and a little bit
of a bitch sometimes.

40:41.105 --> 40:42.189
Are you finished?

40:42.273 --> 40:45.151
Yes, but I just need
to know one thing.

40:45.234 --> 40:46.694
What are you doing with me?

40:46.777 --> 40:49.613
It's a wonder.

40:52.366 --> 40:55.202
You wanted to tell me something.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.872
Um... yeah, I called
the insurance company,

40:57.955 --> 41:00.499
and they said they were
gonna pay to fix the car.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.460
-Oh, that's great. That's great.
-Yeah. Yeah.

41:02.543 --> 41:05.421
Now we can officially
put this whole thing behind us.

41:05.504 --> 41:06.839
Your trip to the desert,

41:06.922 --> 41:10.009
and... and everything
that's happened since.

41:10.092 --> 41:11.385
How does that sound?

41:11.469 --> 41:14.263
I think that sounds great.
