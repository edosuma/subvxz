Felt empty,
dead inside.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.613
You guys brought me
back to life.

05:14.615 --> 05:18.517
You showed me that
my past is exactly that.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.951
I have a life today.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.587
Is it better? Sometimes.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.756
It's different,

05:24.758 --> 05:26.758
And then there are
moments when I get

05:26.760 --> 05:29.428
Little glimpses
of hope.

05:29.430 --> 05:32.397
Those are good days,

05:32.399 --> 05:35.767

of the days,

me to meet her
new boyfriend.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.110
I have no idea why.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.412
Maybe because she's
excited to have you
in her life

05:47.414 --> 05:49.481
And wants to share
it with you.

05:49.483 --> 05:50.782

I want to point out that
I'm only 5 months' sober.

All the more reason
to open your mouth

06:16.610 --> 06:17.743
The stab wounds
are left to right.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.177
Are you sure?

06:19.179 --> 06:20.278
Could have been
right to right

06:20.280 --> 06:22.080
If her attacker
struck like this.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.315
Man: Her bra
and panties are
on the floor,

06:23.317 --> 06:24.683

wearing underwear.

It's...Impulsive
and violent.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.599
She wasn't raped,
but it was a sex crime.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.101
The underwear soiled
by the chair.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.169
Meaning?

06:44.171 --> 06:45.871
The chair's
positioned
over her body.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.506
He masturbated
and sat down
to do it.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.207
And the blood
on the left side
of the table

06:49.209 --> 06:51.009
Is where he laid
the knife down

06:51.011 --> 06:53.712
Because that's
the hand he used
to do his business

06:53.714 --> 06:55.514
Because he was
left-handed.

When the train stopped,

14:43.183 --> 14:44.582
Our 3 perps hopped
the tracks,

14:44.584 --> 14:46.351
Exited via
the uptown tunnel,

14:46.353 --> 14:48.653
Used a fire exit,
so no eyewitnesses.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.655
Phillips: What about
the victim?

14:50.657 --> 14:52.957
She's being treated
at manhattan memorial,
multiple stab wounds,

14:52.959 --> 14:54.659
All defensive.

14:54.661 --> 14:55.793
Doctor says we should
be able to speak to her
within the hour.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.629
Anything from
the security cameras?

14:57.631 --> 15:01.633
Oh, yeah.
We got the whole show.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.806
I don't want
to have sex.

15:08.808 --> 15:12.010
Everything's always
about sex.

15:12.012 --> 15:15.780
I'm not opposed to it,
but...

15:15.782 --> 15:18.650
It's not as important
as people make it.

15:21.353 --> 15:25.790
I th--I think
touching's more important.

15:25.792 --> 15:29.761
If you do it right,
you can feel it always...

15:33.866 --> 15:35.767
Even after you stop.

15:42.808 --> 15:45.376
I'm hungry.
You have any food?

15:54.553 --> 15:57.155
Hey, heather! I can make
an egg white omelet

15:57.157 --> 15:59.324
With some spinach!

16:07.499 --> 16:10.034
[music playing]

16:10.036 --> 16:13.104

16:13.106 --> 16:14.505
What are you
doing here?

16:14.507 --> 16:16.040
Tony, shots.
Shots for everybody.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.175
Hey, ryan.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.242
How you doing, man?

16:18.244 --> 16:20.511
Oh. It's good
to see you.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.013
Hey. You look good.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.315
Come here.
I want you to
meet some people.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.385
So how long you
in town for?

16:27.387 --> 16:28.686
Uh, head back tomorrow.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.355
Cool, cool.

16:30.357 --> 16:34.592
Hey. How's
joey doing?

16:34.594 --> 16:36.527
He's safe.
Beyond that, I don't know.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.963
His grandmother agreed
to witness protection.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.332
Look. I got to testify
in front of the grand jury.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.467
You do, too.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.835
Yeah.
That's coming up.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.170
That last day in the woods
after you left me,

16:46.172 --> 16:48.706
I took alex's
handcuffs off.

16:48.708 --> 16:52.877
We didn't cuff him,
ryan, you understand?

16:52.879 --> 16:57.749
He lunged at you,
you fired your gun.

16:57.751 --> 17:00.518
This is important, ryan.
Do you understand?

17:00.520 --> 17:03.654
All you have to say is
"I don't remember."

17:03.656 --> 17:05.256
You were emotional,
crazy that day.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.790
You don't recall
what happened.
I got the rest.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.659
You don't have to
lie for me, mike.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.064
You acted impulsively.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.632
They won't condone it
or even believe it,

17:14.634 --> 17:17.335
But they will accept it.

17:17.337 --> 17:20.038
They'll understand
we were trying to
save deborah.

17:23.275 --> 17:26.176
Do you even remember
what deborah told
you that day,

17:26.179 --> 17:28.413
What her
last words were?

17:40.859 --> 17:41.959
Hello, mike.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.194
You look good, ryan.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.362
So what am I
doing here?

17:44.364 --> 17:45.663
What am I doing here?

17:45.665 --> 17:47.932
Phillips: Thank you
for coming, mr. Hardy.

have been contacted

17:53.106 --> 17:55.940
Or engaged in any way
regarding last night's events?

17:55.942 --> 17:56.974
No.

Have you been in contact
with any known

17:58.912 --> 18:00.878
Or unknown followers
of carroll in the past year?

18:00.880 --> 18:02.146
No.

18:02.148 --> 18:03.881
Is there anything
you know that could
help us find

18:03.883 --> 18:07.018
Who did this?

18:07.020 --> 18:08.553
No.

18:11.523 --> 18:13.825
We, uh, value
your input,

you can add.

They were yelling
and screaming

18:27.340 --> 18:29.707
Through their masks.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.642

Crazy things.

18:36.049 --> 18:37.949
"resurrection."

18:37.951 --> 18:42.186
They kept repeating it,
chanting it.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.554
They said,
"joe carroll lives,"

18:43.556 --> 18:48.192
And then they attacked.

18:48.194 --> 18:50.928
Did they say
anything else?

18:53.699 --> 18:56.167
"ryan hardy
can't stop us."

21:19.178 --> 21:20.778
Yes, it has.

21:25.884 --> 21:27.051
Woman on tv: At this time,
law enforcement officials

21:27.053 --> 21:28.552
Are unwilling to say
if this attack

21:28.554 --> 21:30.855
Is connected in any way
to joe carroll,

21:30.857 --> 21:32.923
But as this week marks
the first anniversary

21:32.925 --> 21:35.660
Of carroll's death,
many people are worried

21:35.662 --> 21:37.428
That his vicious cult...

21:37.430 --> 21:38.663
What the hell?

21:38.665 --> 21:40.798
Looks like there's
a new cult.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.366
Who are they?

21:42.368 --> 21:43.968
Who knows?
It's not us,
that's for sure.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.703
Frank thinks
it's carlos,

21:45.705 --> 21:48.239
But I think he's
too dumb to pull
something like this off.

21:48.241 --> 21:49.473
Who?

21:49.475 --> 21:53.311
You know, carlos
from havenport.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.378
You should talk
to frank.

21:54.380 --> 21:55.413

From the adjoining cars?

only have cameras

which they knew.

don't be shy.

Are these your cult boys
or a new fan club?

found 8 and found 8 more.

with the 3 on the train.

We pick them up
on west broadway
going uptown.

22:52.505 --> 22:53.637
And then two
turn right,

22:53.639 --> 22:55.706
One goes solo
eastbound.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.308
More to come.
Most businesses are

22:57.310 --> 22:58.743

their surveillance footage,

22:58.745 --> 23:00.244
And then we have men
going door to door

23:00.246 --> 23:01.946
With court orders
for the rest.

23:01.948 --> 23:04.382
Can you body scan
the 3 suspects?

23:06.885 --> 23:10.488
These are our
known carrollers.

23:14.192 --> 23:16.794
Let's create pre-viz
for males only.

23:25.170 --> 23:27.505
Ok. One match.

23:27.507 --> 23:30.608

23:30.610 --> 23:33.010
He's on our list,
one of our
havenport guys.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.745
He's been mia
for a year.

23:34.747 --> 23:35.846
How sure are you?

23:35.848 --> 23:37.248
It's a 75% match.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.682
That's good enough
for me.

23:38.684 --> 23:40.985
Issue a statement.
Get his face out there.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.586
See if the public can
help identify him.

Is this new cult, old cult,

23:47.493 --> 23:51.162
Fan club, copycat,
groupies?

23:51.164 --> 23:54.899
What, mr. Hardy?
Anything?

23:54.901 --> 23:56.500
Yeah. I wish I could
be more help,

23:56.502 --> 24:00.237
But, you know,
I really haven't
kept up with the case.

24:00.239 --> 24:02.273
I'm strictly
civilian now,

nothing else,

Where you going?

24:19.158 --> 24:20.491
Home.

24:20.493 --> 24:21.892
We didn't find
them all.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.260
Now they're
recruiting more.

resurrect his legacy.

Yeah, probably.

24:30.436 --> 24:31.435

of this, mike.

have food.

You remember him?

25:45.177 --> 25:46.877
Is he the one
with the 4 I.D.S?

25:46.879 --> 25:47.978
Yeah. You had tracked
him to new york

25:47.980 --> 25:50.814
Using rick ruiz
and tony sanchez.

25:50.816 --> 25:53.117
So carlos is one
of the subway killers?

25:53.119 --> 25:54.618
Person of interest.

25:54.620 --> 25:57.021
Let me boot.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.989
The feds brought
intel on, advisory.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.658
I almost signed up for it,
but then I remembered

26:00.660 --> 26:04.862
I'm a part of the ryan hardy
secret task force.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.030
So is it joe's
old cult?

26:06.032 --> 26:08.566
Carlos is.
The other two,
who knows?

26:08.568 --> 26:10.367
And did you share
what you know
with the bureau?

26:10.369 --> 26:12.336
What, this?
This is a hobby.

26:12.338 --> 26:16.473

This isn't a hobby.

from his girlfriend.

he moved back
to california.

Check robert diaz.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.694
It's a name I pulled
from her place.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.896
Are the feds aware
you found this guy's
girlfriend?

26:38.898 --> 26:41.131
I lost her.
What's the point?

Avenue d, huh?

26:55.081 --> 26:57.014
Hey. Um, now would be
the time to tell

26:57.016 --> 26:58.415
The fbi
this information.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.284
Yeah. You're probably
right.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.686
So, max, thanks a lot
for stopping by.

27:02.688 --> 27:04.221
No cab fare?

27:04.223 --> 27:06.357
Hey. Go to the fbi.

27:06.359 --> 27:07.558
They'll figure it out.

27:07.560 --> 27:08.525
Seriously, ryan,

27:08.527 --> 27:10.227
I know I've been
enabling you,

27:10.229 --> 27:12.496
But, uh, maybe it's time
that we stopped this.

27:12.498 --> 27:15.099
Can you lock up
when you leave? Thanks.

[toilet flushes]

28:08.720 --> 28:10.220
Stop!

28:18.396 --> 28:21.965
No, no, no.
I barely touched you.

28:21.967 --> 28:25.369
Hey! Come on!
Hey! Sit up.

28:35.947 --> 28:36.980
Why you running
from me?

28:36.982 --> 28:38.148
You broke
into my place.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.316
You recognized me.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.719
No, man. You broke
into my place.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.654
Ow!

28:43.656 --> 28:45.322
Don't lie to me.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.424
I'm not--
I'm not lying.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.893
Carlos, I know
who you are,

28:49.895 --> 28:53.130
And I know you were
on the subway.

28:53.132 --> 28:56.366
Don't be stupid.
I kill stupid people.

28:56.368 --> 28:59.136
Look. I--I don't
know anything.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.438
You were in havenport
with joe carroll.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.841
Where is he?

29:03.843 --> 29:06.210
Joe carroll--
he's dead.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.911
We both know
that's not true.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.179
Where is he?

29:09.181 --> 29:10.481
He's dead.

29:10.483 --> 29:11.348
Unh!

29:11.350 --> 29:16.653
All right.
I'm talking.

29:16.655 --> 29:20.758
I haven't seen joe
since the light house.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.259
The light house?

29:22.261 --> 29:23.360
You were
at the light house?

29:23.362 --> 29:24.795
What were you
doing there?

29:36.074 --> 29:39.543
I picked him up
on the beach

29:39.545 --> 29:44.848
After the boat house
exploded.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.049
And where did you
take him?

29:46.051 --> 29:47.651
There was a--
there was a roadblock.

29:47.653 --> 29:51.388
It was cops everywhere
that night.

29:51.390 --> 29:55.125
He--he got out.
I haven't seen
him since.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.293
He got out?

29:56.295 --> 29:59.029
Yeah, man. He got out.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.198
There was no way
he was getting through
that roadblock.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.934
And where is he?

30:03.936 --> 30:07.704
I don't know.
No one does.

30:07.706 --> 30:08.772
That's why--

30:08.774 --> 30:10.207
That's why what?

30:10.209 --> 30:11.975

What are you doing?

lure him out?

looking for?

I got it.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.342
What are you
doing here?

34:05.344 --> 34:06.910
I was in
the neighborhood.

34:06.912 --> 34:08.612
Yeah, right.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.746
So what's going on?

34:10.748 --> 34:12.716

You mean claire.

34:31.136 --> 34:33.703
Didn't claire inspire
the character of gwendolyn?

34:44.614 --> 34:48.985
Come on, ryan.
Anything? Anything!

34:48.987 --> 34:50.520
I mean, the murders
in the subway were

34:50.522 --> 34:51.688
A spectacle,
an announcement.

This is a very

Oh, you are

35:02.701 --> 35:03.867
You act like you're
over it,

35:03.869 --> 35:05.902
But you're here
because you care.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.370
You don't know how
not to care,

35:07.372 --> 35:08.538
So if you know something,
just tell me.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.173
Sorry, mike.

35:11.976 --> 35:14.544
Why did you request
carroll's dna records?

35:14.546 --> 35:16.680
6 months ago, you requested
the full report.

35:16.682 --> 35:17.781
I wanted to see
for myself.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.316
What, you weren't
convinced?

35:19.318 --> 35:21.084
His dna matched
his son's dna.

I don't know
where you're going
with this, mike.

35:22.855 --> 35:25.388

He's dead.

What, you couldn't
be bothered?

to you, man.

is that last day,

How every second
played out.

one thing different,

35:50.315 --> 35:52.482
If we had changed

35:52.484 --> 35:55.852

maybe we would have--

35:55.854 --> 35:58.855
Maybe we would have
got to deborah
one second sooner.

If we'd done one thing
different.

36:08.499 --> 36:11.234
What?

36:11.236 --> 36:13.069
You got nothing?

36:16.674 --> 36:18.608
So that's how
it's gonna be.

37:18.203 --> 37:19.569
I have no idea.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.438
You said your
place was safe,
untraceable.

how he knew.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.509

37:26.511 --> 37:29.346
I'm sorry.

37:29.348 --> 37:30.513
What are they
gonna find there

37:30.515 --> 37:31.848
When they search
the place?

37:31.850 --> 37:34.117
Nothing. I mean,
my stuff.

37:34.119 --> 37:35.719
Nothing that's gonna
lead them here.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.554
And I'm supposed
to believe you?

37:37.556 --> 37:39.823
There's nothing
to find.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.024
Maybe some prints, maybe.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.726
I have, like,
10 fake I.D.S out there.

37:42.728 --> 37:45.095
Eh, we trusted you,
carlos,

37:45.097 --> 37:51.067
Brought you in,
made you part
of the family.

37:51.069 --> 37:55.705
Ok. I've done everything
that you guys have said.

37:55.707 --> 37:57.741
What's the problem?
We're cool.

who's gonna get joe.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.816
That's what you want.

38:10.488 --> 38:12.555
Eh, you're right.
It's cool.

38:12.557 --> 38:15.425
Sorry.
I overreacted.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.594
I do that sometimes.

38:26.805 --> 38:31.107

want to hug you.

Why don't you
want to hug me?

you asked earlier

40:00.198 --> 40:02.432
Why this was
happening, and...

I found my answer.

40:05.537 --> 40:09.506
You killed joe carroll,
and his followers are...

40:09.508 --> 40:13.476
Mad about it, I guess.

40:13.478 --> 40:19.149
So...Why are you
really here?

40:22.119 --> 40:26.689
6 people were killed,
and, uh...

You're the only
