00:34.792 --> 00:37.978
So, I watching this show
about spiders on <i>Animal Planet.</i>

00:37.979 --> 00:40.186
<i>We</i> were watching
a show about spiders.

00:40.187 --> 00:41.854
Doesn't hurt your story
to include me.

00:41.905 --> 00:43.539
If you're going to set
the scene, set it right.

00:43.607 --> 00:44.857
Do you want to tell the story?

00:44.925 --> 00:45.925
I don't remember what happened.

00:45.993 --> 00:47.110
Maybe I wasn't there.

00:47.194 --> 00:48.894
Anyway, there's this one spider

00:48.946 --> 00:50.847
that's unlike any other insect.

00:50.914 --> 00:53.883
The mother actually takes care
of her young after they hatch.

00:53.951 --> 00:56.619
Oh, that is so sweet.

00:56.687 --> 00:58.621
Then, once the babies
are big enough,

00:58.689 --> 01:00.690
they overpower their
mom and eat her.

01:00.758 --> 01:02.792
Arachno-matricide!

01:02.860 --> 01:04.610
When I turned 15, I ate my dad.

01:05.846 --> 01:08.247
What is happening
at this dinner?

01:08.315 --> 01:10.049
It's spiraling out of control.

01:10.100 --> 01:11.684
Every year, on my birthday,

01:11.752 --> 01:13.870
I take a celebratory nibble
off his severed leg.

01:13.937 --> 01:15.171
I keep it in the freezer.

01:15.239 --> 01:17.974
That must be what's making
the ice cubes all fuzzy.

01:18.041 --> 01:20.359
Damn it, Roger. Your race
is the most disgusting...

01:20.427 --> 01:22.762
Finished!

01:22.830 --> 01:24.280
What just happened?

01:24.348 --> 01:25.481
Steve finished his dinner.

01:25.549 --> 01:27.717
But I still have
three bites left.

01:27.785 --> 01:29.385
I always finish first.

01:29.453 --> 01:32.188
Well, I guess not tonight.

01:32.256 --> 01:34.957
So these popsicles are weird.

01:37.728 --> 01:41.147
It's finally happening.

01:41.215 --> 01:42.415
What?

01:42.483 --> 01:43.616
Steve.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.751
He finished his meal before me.

01:45.819 --> 01:47.954
He's challenging
me for dominance.

01:48.021 --> 01:50.223
Like when the
young, upstart lion

01:50.290 --> 01:52.458
forces the elderly
lion out of the pride

01:52.509 --> 01:54.510
and into the wilderness
to die alone.

01:54.578 --> 01:57.280
You're watching too
many nature shows.

01:57.347 --> 01:58.815
You know what's a good show?

01:58.882 --> 02:01.284
You shutting up
and going to bed.

02:01.351 --> 02:03.119
This is the beginning
of the end.

02:03.187 --> 02:06.122
He's on the upswing,
and I'm on the downswing.

02:06.190 --> 02:07.890
I've known this day would come.

02:07.958 --> 02:10.359
I've been dreading it
for a long time.

02:10.443 --> 02:12.261
One last push.

02:14.364 --> 02:16.032
Oh, my God!

02:16.099 --> 02:18.534
I just tore from
my "V" to my "A"!

02:18.602 --> 02:19.952
That's normal.

02:20.020 --> 02:21.821
She's ruined.

02:25.108 --> 02:26.175
It's a boy.

02:28.879 --> 02:32.081
I know you're coming for me.

02:32.149 --> 02:33.666
You're being silly.

02:33.734 --> 02:35.651
So he finished his meal first.

02:35.719 --> 02:37.253
He's growing up.

02:37.321 --> 02:38.921
It's a good thing.

02:38.989 --> 02:41.624
Well, this old lion isn't
going down without a fight.

02:41.692 --> 02:44.460
Hey, I'm looking
at myself in the mirror.

02:44.528 --> 02:46.095
It's not ruined.

02:46.163 --> 02:49.432
I mean, it's not good,
but it's not ruined.

02:52.236 --> 02:53.903
Yay! Dr. House
is skateboarding.

02:55.756 --> 02:56.956

I was eating that.

Hey. I was
watching that.

02:59.676 --> 03:01.160
Hey. I was
sitting there.

03:01.228 --> 03:02.461
Pipe down, boy.

03:02.529 --> 03:04.030
Because that's what you are.
A boy.

03:04.097 --> 03:05.865
And I'm the king of this jungle.

03:09.052 --> 03:11.454
That's odd, what you're doing.

03:11.522 --> 03:12.955
Get used to it.

03:13.023 --> 03:14.440
What are you doing?

03:14.508 --> 03:18.477
That is not how we treat
little boys in this house!

03:18.545 --> 03:20.947
Hey, you're opening
the wrong end.

03:21.014 --> 03:23.649
It doesn't matter
what end you open.

03:23.717 --> 03:25.418
See? Now you broke it.

03:25.485 --> 03:26.619
You can't break something

03:26.687 --> 03:28.120
before you put it together,
Dumbo.

03:28.188 --> 03:30.089
Don't call me my favorite movie!

03:30.157 --> 03:32.992
Oh, babe.
Look at us.

03:33.060 --> 03:34.827
We're fighting all the time,

03:34.895 --> 03:36.429
like
well-managed boxers.

03:36.496 --> 03:37.964
Maybe we need help.

03:38.031 --> 03:39.932
Maybe we need
to talk to someone.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.634
You mean, like, a
marriage counselor?

03:41.702 --> 03:44.070
No way! We've been married
for, like, five minutes.

03:44.137 --> 03:46.472
They say the honeymoon phase
is the hardest part.

03:47.708 --> 03:48.808
No one says that.

03:48.875 --> 03:50.343
You're driving me insane.

03:50.410 --> 03:51.677
Could you just leave
the room, please?

03:51.745 --> 03:53.045
Do you want to have sex first?

03:53.113 --> 03:54.947
Whatever.

04:00.354 --> 04:02.972
Mm-hmm. Just as I expected.

04:03.056 --> 04:04.674
Dad just pushed me
off the couch

04:04.741 --> 04:06.008
and took my food.

04:06.076 --> 04:08.177
I-I think he was
acting like a lion.

04:08.245 --> 04:10.880
Oh, your father has a
crazy idea in his head.

04:10.948 --> 04:12.281
He's just...

04:12.349 --> 04:14.684
Well, he's intimidated by you.

04:14.751 --> 04:16.986
Dad? Intimidated by me?

04:17.053 --> 04:19.322
You finished your food first
last night,

04:19.389 --> 04:21.591
and now he's scared
you're coming into your prime

04:21.658 --> 04:23.659
and going to dethrone him.

04:23.727 --> 04:26.028
What?
That's ridiculous.

04:26.096 --> 04:27.396
I'm no threat to him.

04:27.464 --> 04:29.532
We'll talk and straighten
this whole mess out.

04:37.608 --> 04:40.176
Mm-hmm. That's what I thought.

04:43.146 --> 04:44.397
It smells like pee.

04:44.464 --> 04:45.848
This is <i>my</i> area.

04:45.916 --> 04:47.133
Look, Dad...

04:48.552 --> 04:50.987
Mom said you were worried
I'm going to dethrone you,

04:51.054 --> 04:53.189
and, well,
I just want you to know...

04:53.256 --> 04:55.625
you should be.

04:57.327 --> 04:58.661

04:58.729 --> 05:01.497
Now I know.
You're afraid of me.

05:02.799 --> 05:04.567
You've always
been afraid of me.

05:04.635 --> 05:06.068
That-That's not true.

05:06.136 --> 05:08.738
Quiet! Every day,
you get weaker,

05:08.805 --> 05:10.406
and I get stronger.

05:10.474 --> 05:13.075
So enjoy that popcorn
and remote while you can,

05:13.143 --> 05:15.311
because soon I'll be
sitting where you are,

05:15.379 --> 05:17.813
and you'll be looking
for a spot under the porch

05:17.881 --> 05:20.950
where you can curl up and die.

05:21.018 --> 05:23.019
Nuh-uh. I'm the king of...

05:23.086 --> 05:24.620
You're the king of nothing!

05:24.688 --> 05:27.023
Nothing.

05:29.710 --> 05:31.911
Done!

05:31.978 --> 05:33.062
For thine is the kingdom

05:33.146 --> 05:34.096
and the power and
the glory. Amen.

05:34.164 --> 05:36.782
Done!

05:38.018 --> 05:38.934
Done!

05:40.220 --> 05:41.354
Oh, hey. Don't mind me.

05:41.421 --> 05:42.872
I finished ten minutes ago.

05:42.939 --> 05:44.140
I'm just looking
for the plunger.

05:44.207 --> 05:46.609
Mine's so big,
it won't go down.

05:46.677 --> 05:48.611
Oh. Was there a
rabbit in here?

05:54.067 --> 05:57.103
My reign is over.

05:57.170 --> 06:00.873
My son bested me in everything
that's dear to me.

06:00.941 --> 06:02.908
Yeah, I heard about
the bunny poops.

06:02.976 --> 06:04.844
I'm... I'm done.

06:04.911 --> 06:07.646
He's replaced me
as head of the house.

06:07.714 --> 06:10.649
Why don't you do what the
animals do on your TV shows?

06:10.717 --> 06:12.451
When an older male
is threatened,

06:12.519 --> 06:15.571
he responds by
reasserting his dominance.

06:15.655 --> 06:18.223
The bull walrus will
ward off all challengers

06:18.275 --> 06:20.392
with an extreme
display of power.

06:20.444 --> 06:22.862
Only the strongest walrus
will be able to mate.

06:22.929 --> 06:24.263
That's it.

06:24.331 --> 06:25.664
Klaus, you're a genius!

06:25.732 --> 06:27.099
Genius? No.

06:27.167 --> 06:28.267
You know who's a genius?

06:28.335 --> 06:29.635
Jack Worcestershire.

06:29.703 --> 06:31.670
Had a terrible name,
created a terrible sauce,

06:31.738 --> 06:33.072
made a fortune.

06:33.140 --> 06:36.409
Yup, Snotters.
I got my old man on the ropes.

06:36.476 --> 06:39.211
I'm the man of the house now,
and he knows it.

06:39.279 --> 06:41.781
I should probably learn to make
chili that's not very good

06:41.848 --> 06:43.616
that I call "my famous chili."

06:46.520 --> 06:49.388
Ooh, comic.

06:49.456 --> 06:51.791
Ooh.

06:51.858 --> 06:53.292
Ooh!

06:54.494 --> 06:55.661
Ooh!

06:57.664 --> 06:59.098
Ooh.

06:59.166 --> 07:01.133
Ooh...

07:01.201 --> 07:02.902
Sounds like Mommy found a comic.

07:11.445 --> 07:13.796
Oh, no. It's Steve.

07:13.864 --> 07:15.431
Oh, my God!
Steve, don't look!

07:15.499 --> 07:16.665
Yeah, Steve, don't look.

07:16.733 --> 07:17.933
Look!

07:18.001 --> 07:19.769
Mommy and Daddy
are just dancing.

07:19.836 --> 07:20.970
Yeah, we're dancing.

07:21.037 --> 07:21.937
We're not dancing.

07:31.916 --> 07:34.684
Hey, champ. I, uh,
wanted to talk to you.

07:34.752 --> 07:36.152
You know, about
what you just saw.

07:36.220 --> 07:38.455
Because things aren't
always what they appear.

07:38.522 --> 07:40.673
Sometimes when someone
is choking,

07:40.741 --> 07:42.876
you have to get behind them
and give them the Heimlich.

07:42.943 --> 07:45.378
This was not that.

07:45.446 --> 07:47.480
I was not helping your mother
with a leg cramp.

07:47.548 --> 07:49.616
I was not giving her
a lying-down hug.

07:49.683 --> 07:51.501
I was not helping her look
for her contact.

07:51.552 --> 07:53.069
I was plowing, Steve.

07:53.137 --> 07:54.370
Oh, my goodness.

07:54.438 --> 07:57.107
See, in the animal kingdom,
he who mates is king.

07:57.174 --> 07:59.175
And you are many, many years

07:59.243 --> 08:00.510
from finding
a mate of your own.

08:00.578 --> 08:02.078
This is nature, bitch.

08:02.146 --> 08:03.897
We're getting primal
in this house.

08:11.505 --> 08:13.073
This is where we're having
marriage counseling?

08:13.140 --> 08:14.941
In-in a community
center pottery class?

08:15.009 --> 08:17.827
Public-assisted counseling
is all we can afford, babe.

08:17.878 --> 08:20.280
Whoa! Someone
actually showed up.

08:20.347 --> 08:22.582
Principal Lewis?
You're a psychologist?

08:22.650 --> 08:24.851
Oh, no. I just do this
to pick up some extra cash

08:24.919 --> 08:26.119
to feed my watch fetish.

08:26.187 --> 08:27.720
Look at this bad boy.

08:27.788 --> 08:30.957
Huh? Mickey Mouse
in an S.S. uniform.

08:31.025 --> 08:33.126
Only ten were made
in the whole world.

08:33.193 --> 08:35.227
I own five of them.

08:35.296 --> 08:38.097
Now, if only I could tell time.

08:38.164 --> 08:39.732
I'm out of here.
No, babe.

08:39.799 --> 08:40.967
This is important.

08:41.034 --> 08:43.436
Looks like you two
aren't seeing eye-to-eye.

08:43.504 --> 08:45.205
I can help with that.

08:46.807 --> 08:49.175
Yep, looks like the pottery
class is coming in.

08:49.243 --> 08:51.578
Perhaps we should relocate

08:51.645 --> 08:53.729
as I am not legally
permitted to be

08:53.781 --> 08:55.865
within 100 feet
of the instructor,

08:55.916 --> 08:59.853
or more specifically,
her sugary sweet ass.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.421
Oh, baby.

09:07.495 --> 09:09.162
Steve, sit next to me.

09:09.230 --> 09:11.581
I can't sit up there.
My dad marked it.

09:11.649 --> 09:13.766
I'm not allowed to sit
anywhere he's peed.

09:13.834 --> 09:16.202
Oh, we can pee where
we sit now? Great!

09:16.270 --> 09:18.354
I don't know what to do
about my dad, Roger.

09:18.422 --> 09:20.323
I was finally coming
into my own.

09:20.391 --> 09:23.259
I got a taste of first-class
and now I'm back in coach,

09:23.327 --> 09:25.595
squished between two
fat ladies from Toronto.

09:25.663 --> 09:27.664
Ugh, Blue Jay fans
are the worst.

09:27.731 --> 09:30.166
I don't know, you ever been
to a Detroit Tigers game?

09:30.234 --> 09:31.734
Those fans are drunken slobs.

09:31.802 --> 09:33.169
At least there's some diversity.

09:33.237 --> 09:35.605
You ever see a black man
at a Red Sox game

09:35.673 --> 09:37.907
who's not playing first base
or singing the national anthem?

09:37.975 --> 09:39.375
So true, so true.

09:39.443 --> 09:40.727
You know what we should do?

09:40.794 --> 09:42.495
We should take
a train into D.C.,

09:42.563 --> 09:43.963
and see the Nationals play.

09:44.031 --> 09:45.198
We totally should.

09:45.266 --> 09:46.499
Maybe a day game.

09:46.567 --> 09:48.084
Yes. Will you look
into getting tickets?

09:48.135 --> 09:50.503
Are we serious about this,
or are we just talking about it?

09:50.571 --> 09:52.572
Pull the trigger, man,
pull the trigger, let's do it.

09:52.640 --> 09:53.806
Oh, I'm so excited.

09:53.891 --> 09:56.059
I'm gonna go do it right now.

Well, me neither.

10:22.136 --> 10:23.469

So great.

10:24.805 --> 10:26.122
You know what we should do?

10:26.190 --> 10:28.708
We should call a cab,

10:28.776 --> 10:29.976
Totally.

10:30.044 --> 10:31.444

What?! No, Roger!

10:34.615 --> 10:36.082

10:36.150 --> 10:37.650
Right. Well, it seems to me

10:37.718 --> 10:39.986
the only way you can
regain the upper hand

10:40.054 --> 10:41.854
is to assert your dominance.

10:41.922 --> 10:44.290
Luckily, I know an easy way
to make that happen.

10:44.358 --> 10:46.259
I've been trying to think
of a way all day.

10:46.327 --> 10:47.660
Surely, it can't be that easy.

10:47.728 --> 10:49.229
As a matter of fact, it is.

10:53.901 --> 10:55.318
So great.

The pilot has an unnatural
interest in that little boy.

11:02.259 --> 11:04.260
It didn't seem unnatural to me.

11:08.782 --> 11:11.551
All right, welcome to my home.

11:11.619 --> 11:13.419
As you can see, it is a (bleep).

11:13.487 --> 11:15.888
But it's a good arena
for bonding exercises

11:15.956 --> 11:17.757
and a constant reminder
of what happens

11:17.825 --> 11:20.059
if you try to strike
some sense into you lady.

11:20.127 --> 11:21.628
You're a marriage counselor?

11:21.695 --> 11:24.497
Step one on you path
to a happier union:

11:24.565 --> 11:26.933
You have 45 minutes
to clean this room,

11:27.001 --> 11:29.569
<i>but</i> you can't talk
to each other.

11:29.637 --> 11:31.537
Not one word.
Trust me on this.

11:31.605 --> 11:33.323
Let's go, Jeff.
This isn't real.

11:34.491 --> 11:35.692
It just got real, bitch!

11:35.759 --> 11:37.193
Now clean my house!

This is even better

11:51.709 --> 11:53.426
Oh, right, right.

11:53.494 --> 11:55.461
We were talking about asserting
your dominance over your dad.

11:55.529 --> 11:56.829
What is it with us?

11:56.897 --> 11:58.731
We're a couple of
Forget-Me-Marys.

11:58.799 --> 12:01.567
Yeah, we're a couple
of Distracted-Susans.

12:01.635 --> 12:04.771
Forget-Me-Marys wasn't
good enough for you?

12:04.838 --> 12:06.139
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:06.206 --> 12:08.141
I thought we were doing
like a back and forth.

12:08.208 --> 12:09.776
No, we weren't.

12:09.843 --> 12:11.644
I said we were
Forget-Me-Marys,

12:11.712 --> 12:13.813
and that's what we are.

12:16.116 --> 12:18.951
Okay, you've beaten
your dad in every arena

12:19.019 --> 12:21.154
except one... sex.

12:21.221 --> 12:23.856
The dominant male
proves himself by mating.

12:23.924 --> 12:25.358
So the solution is simple...

12:25.426 --> 12:27.060
you need to bang.
Bang, bang, bang.

12:27.127 --> 12:29.562
But I don't know any girls.

12:29.630 --> 12:32.832
Well luckily, I've got just
the ladies' man persona

12:32.900 --> 12:34.767

your shlinker

12:34.835 --> 12:37.603

12:44.211 --> 12:45.645
Yes.

12:45.713 --> 12:49.349
Okay, well, then you
definitely don't want Ace.

20:11.070 --> 20:13.155
You win. I'm never
going to be a man.

20:13.222 --> 20:14.489
I know.

20:14.557 --> 20:17.225
Especially if I keep raising
you like we're walruses.

20:17.293 --> 20:19.061
Your mother was right.

20:19.128 --> 20:22.197
You're growing up, and I
shouldn't try to stop you.

20:22.265 --> 20:25.167
My job as a father is
to give you the skills

20:25.234 --> 20:27.769
and the confidence to send you
out into the real world.

20:27.837 --> 20:31.073
Judging by tonight,
I clearly haven't done that.

20:31.140 --> 20:32.741
But that changes now.

20:32.809 --> 20:34.042
You're going to get me laid?

20:34.110 --> 20:35.844
No, no, you're
too young for sex.

20:35.912 --> 20:37.379
Let's start with the basics.

20:37.447 --> 20:38.914
I'm going to teach
you how to shave.

20:42.352 --> 20:44.186
Looking good, Steve.

20:44.253 --> 20:45.787
I'm still going to finish
before you, though.

20:45.855 --> 20:46.955
No, you're not.

20:47.023 --> 20:48.557
Yes, I am. I'm almost...
Done!

20:48.625 --> 20:50.292
Good job, son.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.127
Very impressive.

20:52.195 --> 20:53.428
Smooth...

20:53.496 --> 20:54.663
and no nicks.

20:54.731 --> 20:55.714
You're a natural.

20:55.781 --> 20:57.115
Thanks, Dad.

20:57.183 --> 20:58.900
It's much better to
practice on a man's back

20:58.968 --> 21:00.369
rather than you own face.

21:00.436 --> 21:01.803
Good thing we found
your school's principal

21:01.871 --> 21:03.772
passed out
in your sister's room.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.440
What do we do with him now?

21:05.508 --> 21:07.659
Hey, I know that look.

21:07.727 --> 21:09.861
I'll take it from here.

21:09.929 --> 21:19.481
