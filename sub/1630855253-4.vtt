00:20.020 --> 00:21.479
<i>Previously on </i>Manifest…

00:21.563 --> 00:23.773
June 2nd, 2024.

00:23.857 --> 00:28.111
-How did you get that so fast?
-It's been right in front of us all along.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.863
I was scared.

00:29.946 --> 00:32.490
Are you saying that you felt
what Beverly was feeling?

00:32.574 --> 00:34.117
I think I did.

00:34.200 --> 00:38.413
I also know what it's like to take
someone's life because I did by accident.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.623
<i>Erika Burness. Patrol picked her up</i>

00:40.707 --> 00:43.543
after she held up a gun store
with her boyfriend, Randall Barr.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.838
Director Vance
covering his ass all over again.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.923
We have no idea
what he's gotten away with.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.176
Help me. Please, Adrian.

00:51.259 --> 00:53.553
Mommy, my tummy. I'm hungry.

00:53.636 --> 00:55.680
Mom kicked Angelina out.

00:55.764 --> 00:59.559
You were the only person
who wanted her back in the house.

00:59.642 --> 01:03.438
The Callings have you.
Eden has no one other than me.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.970
Hey, so I just had a Call--

02:17.053 --> 02:20.056
I'm sorry, I can't.
I've got a new lead on Eden.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.017
Great. Where'd you get the lead?

02:23.101 --> 02:24.435
Have you seen my keys?

02:25.019 --> 02:27.397
I don't know. Maybe in the key bowl.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.109
Ben. What's the lead?

02:33.444 --> 02:36.990
Eagan. I didn't forget who he was
or what he's done.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.992
-Ben! What--
-This is real, Mick.

02:39.742 --> 02:40.577
I can feel it.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.998
Please be careful.
Eagan is in prison for a reason.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.542
So no matter what he says,
no matter what hope he offers,

02:47.625 --> 02:49.711
please remember who you're talking to.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.463
You need proof, not hope.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.884
What I need is my daughter back.

03:03.099 --> 03:06.686
You already have…
you already have the answer.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.272
You're gonna burn a hole in the floor.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.150
Well, Fiona said
I already had the answer to something.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.526
Like what? The airplane?

03:13.610 --> 03:15.612
No, I was wrong about that
this whole time.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.363
She said there was more to do.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.199
What does she mean?

03:19.282 --> 03:21.659
I still don't know,
but how about we take five?

03:21.743 --> 03:24.412
You know,
I think I finally mastered Mom's pancakes.

03:24.495 --> 03:25.955
Yeah, maybe later.

03:27.290 --> 03:32.045
Reminds me of his dad.
And his aunt. Tenacious to a fault.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.546
Well, he's overwhelmed.

03:33.630 --> 03:37.508
And he still has that scar.
No one knows what it is.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.803
Dad should be helping him.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.514
Hard to see a loved one suffer.

03:43.598 --> 03:46.184
Especially on an empty stomach. Eat.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.978
Have some OJ. Fresh-squeezed this morning.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.732
Mm, I think I saw you pour the bottle.

03:52.815 --> 03:55.068
-I squeezed the bottle.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.489
You know, I really…

03:59.989 --> 04:02.867
I can't imagine what life would be like
without you here.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.871
Hey, team effort.
You've done just as much.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.706
You grew up faster than anyone should.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.838
You should really say that to Cal.

04:16.631 --> 04:17.632
I…

04:18.424 --> 04:19.968
I'm really worried about him.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.929
He may look your age,
but he's still a kid at heart

04:23.012 --> 04:24.514
who needs someone by his side.

04:25.556 --> 04:28.851
If that can't be Ben,
maybe that someone should be you.

04:49.414 --> 04:53.293
Hi there. I'm Drea Mikami.
I'm from the 828 Registry.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.878
I'm here to pick up a passenger
by the name of Kyle Boyd.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.631
He decided to miss
all of his mandatory check-ins,

04:58.715 --> 05:00.550
so now there's
an arrest warrant out for him.

05:00.633 --> 05:04.304
You should've passed a sign on the way in.
Says Shinnecock Nation Territory.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.014
Yeah, I saw that.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.265
Means this is sovereign land,

05:07.348 --> 05:09.934
which makes that piece of paper
just a piece of paper.

05:10.518 --> 05:14.063
Look, I respect that, but the Registry's
really serious about this kind of stuff.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.274
And honestly, I'm probably your best bet

05:16.357 --> 05:19.944
because the next cop they send out here
isn't gonna be as chill.

05:20.028 --> 05:23.239
They're a bunch of hard-asses. So let's
make this easy on the both of us, okay?

05:24.198 --> 05:25.033
How about

05:26.159 --> 05:28.536
you get in your car
and drive back down the road?

05:29.871 --> 05:31.456
Don't get easier than that.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.564
Hey. How was it?

05:57.273 --> 05:58.483
Uh, it was… it was fine.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.700
How was it really?

06:09.035 --> 06:12.080
I went to the cemetery.
And, yeah, I had a Calling.

06:12.163 --> 06:15.041
Thought so. You have that patented
Stone-on-a-mission look.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.752
I'm still trying to figure out what it is.
There was this huge--

06:20.671 --> 06:21.964
-Hey.
-<i>Hey, girl.</i>

06:22.048 --> 06:23.674
Calling to see how you're doing.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.259
You too? I'm fine.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.136
-You guys, I'm fine.
-Okay.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.305
<i>I just know it's a tough day.</i>

06:29.389 --> 06:30.264
How many years?

06:30.348 --> 06:31.766
Since Evie?

06:32.350 --> 06:35.812
Four, for me, at least.
Anyways, how are you doing?

06:35.895 --> 06:36.854
<i>Oh, me?</i>

06:36.938 --> 06:38.856
I am fabulous.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.609
I'm just running down
this list of passengers

06:41.692 --> 06:43.486
who haven't gone
to their Registry check-ins.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.279
And now I have this one guy

06:45.363 --> 06:48.491
<i>who hasn't been</i>
<i>to a single check-in at all. Not one.</i>

06:48.991 --> 06:51.953
<i>Good job, Kyle. Now you've got</i>
<i>a full-blown arrest warrant.</i>

06:52.036 --> 06:56.374
<i>And the cherry on top, I can't even get</i>
<i>to him because he's on sovereign land.</i>

06:58.209 --> 07:00.169
Let me guess. Shinnecock Nation land?

07:00.253 --> 07:01.629
What? How did you know that?

07:01.712 --> 07:04.257
Hey, you've, uh, helped me
more than you know. Thanks.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.301
You're welcome.

07:12.765 --> 07:13.891
Professor.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.478
-A sight for sore eyes.
-Where is she?

07:17.562 --> 07:19.313
Easy now.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.107
I know you aren't a professor of physics,

07:21.190 --> 07:23.985
but I'm assuming you're familiar
with the concept of leverage?

07:24.068 --> 07:25.403
Where the hell is my daughter?

07:25.486 --> 07:26.487
Dumbing it down.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.489
If you haven't figured it out yet,

07:28.990 --> 07:31.701
I'm the one with leverage
in this situation.

07:32.368 --> 07:35.663
But we've got a history,
so I'll give you a fair deal.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.667
You get what you want
when you give me what I want.

07:40.710 --> 07:41.586
And what is that?

07:42.795 --> 07:46.799
Benjamin, it's tattooed
across my face in black and blue.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.011
I want out.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.639
You want me to get you out of prison?

07:56.017 --> 07:57.894
How the hell
do you want me to do that, Eagan?

07:57.977 --> 08:00.688
You're a smart guy. You'll find a way.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.526
Or I'll die in here
and take Eden's location with me.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.154
You don't have a clue. Mick was right.
I should've known better.

08:08.237 --> 08:09.322
-Guard!
-I had a Calling.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.199
I saw her as plain as I see you now.

08:11.282 --> 08:14.035
She was drawing. Kid's got a knack for it.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.039
Every little girl loves drawing.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.875
Ah, but this girl's not just
a flowers-and-rainbows-type chick.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.252
Has a thing for spiders.

08:26.422 --> 08:27.965
Tell me where she is.

08:28.841 --> 08:32.720
Okay, buddy,
just as soon as you secure my release.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.412
You don't look like a hard-ass.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.084
First cop made it sound like
they'd send a Terminator out here next.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.710
Uh, yeah, no, I'm not a cop,

09:04.794 --> 09:06.879
and I'm not here to arrest anyone.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.881
My name is Michaela Stone.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.591
Kyle and I, we were on 828 together.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.468
I really need to talk to him.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.017
You okay there?

09:27.858 --> 09:30.403
Okay, look, I know you've got
no reason to trust me,

09:30.486 --> 09:32.071
but I really need you to hear me out.

09:32.154 --> 09:36.117
I can't explain, but I was led here,
and I can tell you that Kyle lives there,

09:36.200 --> 09:37.868
strange as that sounds.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.413
I've heard stranger.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.418
I'll take you to talk to him.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.169
But if he doesn't wanna talk to you,

09:47.253 --> 09:49.839
you're headed back down the road
just like the other lady.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.434
-You busy?
-I thought you had work.

10:01.517 --> 10:02.893
I took the day off.

10:02.977 --> 10:03.811
Why?

10:05.229 --> 10:08.357
Uh, I thought you could use
an extra set of ears.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.776
Maybe bounce some ideas around

10:10.860 --> 10:12.695
instead of that ball.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.905
Thanks.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.459
-What are you doing?
-Zeke ordered a pizza.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.501
I'm getting the door.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.462
And how are you gonna do that, Gabriel,

10:29.545 --> 10:32.673
when no one's supposed to see you?
Remember? You don't exist.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.843
Maybe I shouldn't have come back at all.
Then I really wouldn't exist.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.178
Yeah, maybe you shouldn't have.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.686
Okay, walk me through it.

10:45.770 --> 10:46.771
Where are we?

10:47.313 --> 10:48.856
It's what Fiona said.

10:48.939 --> 10:51.192
"You already have the answer."

10:51.692 --> 10:54.612
I feel like it made sense at the time.
But I've been racking my brain,

10:54.695 --> 10:57.865
and I can't solve it. I just suck at this.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.992
Well, lucky for you,

11:00.618 --> 11:04.080
your sister happens
to kick ass at this sort of thing.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.915
You know, maybe you've got it all wrong.

11:05.998 --> 11:09.585
Maybe the answer isn't up there,

11:10.252 --> 11:11.337
but over there.

11:18.135 --> 11:21.639
Let's break it down.
This is how I figured out the Death Date.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.309
I don't think Dad would want us messing--

11:25.393 --> 11:28.145
Dad doesn't look at these boards anymore.
Okay? And he's not even here.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.939
So we're gonna do this our way.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.691
Twin power.

11:35.736 --> 11:36.570
Hey.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.949
Thank you, Ol.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.158
You know, you're right.

11:41.867 --> 11:42.993
You do kick ass.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.748
Would you help me?

11:47.832 --> 11:50.710
You can fix this.
He's already served time.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.002
Let me get this straight.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.089
You want me to get a passenger
who was a convicted felon

11:55.172 --> 11:56.674
released from prison in exchange

11:56.757 --> 11:59.552
for information on someone
the government declared dead.

11:59.635 --> 12:00.678
Do I have that right?

12:00.761 --> 12:04.140
Every second I'm here explaining myself
to you is another second lost.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.809
The only thing standing between
me and my daughter is you!

12:06.892 --> 12:10.396
Are you hearing this? He's been here
for almost an hour. I feel terrible.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.814
<i>But Colvin's not gonna budge.</i>

12:11.897 --> 12:14.150
I'm happy to swing by. Talk to him.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.111
No, you're supposed to keep your nose
out of Registry business. Remember?

12:17.194 --> 12:18.112
<i>I'll calm him down.</i>

12:18.195 --> 12:20.781
-Coming over tonight?
-<i>Doubt I'll be out of here in time.</i>

12:20.865 --> 12:23.284
I've got a growing list
of delinquent passengers,

12:23.367 --> 12:24.577
a sovereign rights issue,

12:24.660 --> 12:28.497
and now I've got another BS phone call
about a dubious passenger.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.876
This time it's about
a "suspicious purchase of fertilizer."

12:31.959 --> 12:33.210
Fertilizer?

12:33.294 --> 12:34.920
-Who called that in?
-<i>Some hater.</i>

12:35.004 --> 12:37.923
A salesman from, um, Yeager Garden Center?

12:38.007 --> 12:40.050
Wait, in Bayside? I'll go talk to the guy.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.219
If anyone at the Registry
gets wind of that…

12:42.303 --> 12:44.889
-Who's gonna tell 'em?
-I don't know. Maybe your partner?

12:44.972 --> 12:47.725
Please. Let me worry about Diaz.

12:47.808 --> 12:50.269
It's a drive-by. This hater wants to feel
like somebody's on it.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.104
Maybe then this guy'll stop telling people

12:52.188 --> 12:54.106
that there's a passenger out there
making bombs.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.108
Perfect. Just send me the deets.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.666
Come on, lady.

13:18.798 --> 13:19.882
Hey, Tela.

13:20.674 --> 13:24.595
Blondie here says the two of you go back.
Says she needs to talk to you.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.533
You have a visitor.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.385
Well, this is a surprise.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.681
I need a favor.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.891
It's good to see you too.

14:10.975 --> 14:11.976
It's about Eden.

14:12.059 --> 14:15.729
The last time I saw you…
A year ago, is it?

14:16.355 --> 14:19.817
I told you I'd done
everything I could to find Eden.

14:19.900 --> 14:23.112
Afterward, you stopped taking
my calls, my texts, emails.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.280
I've been

14:25.656 --> 14:26.782
preoccupied.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.908
Me too.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.160
Trying to protect the passengers.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.997
You used to understand
the importance of that.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.165
Hell, we used to do that together.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.750
Now you show up after all this time,

14:36.834 --> 14:38.627
tell me to stop everything
and help you again.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.421
-This time it's gonna be different.
-Oh…

14:41.005 --> 14:42.673
Eagan knows where she is.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.177
I know. I know it's a big ask.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.139
But Eagan, he holds all the cards.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.391
He's not gonna give up anything
without a guarantee.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.393
All I need is for you to make a few calls.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.854
An immunity deal.
A commutation on his sentence.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.731
-Something, anything--
-Ben!

14:59.815 --> 15:03.027
You overestimate my reach.
Look at where you are.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.403
What I have at my disposal.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.740
Does any of this bear the imprimatur
of a government agency to you?

15:08.449 --> 15:10.618
Saanvi's off on a Hail Mary attempt

15:10.701 --> 15:14.747
to acquire an fMRI machine right now
because we can't even afford one.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.457
Saanvi works here?

15:34.058 --> 15:35.059
This is Saanvi's?

15:35.142 --> 15:39.313
Two years is a long time, Ben.
People change. Saanvi. You.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.023
Me.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.485
Look, I'm not plugged in
the way I used to be. I'm sorry.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.862
Come on, Vance.
You were with the NSA for years.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.490
You've gotta have
some political capital stored up.

15:49.573 --> 15:53.202
We're talking about the man
who broke into my house,

15:53.285 --> 15:56.372
held my boy hostage.
I'm gonna help the son of a bitch?

15:56.455 --> 15:58.374
I'm not asking you to help Eagan, Vance.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.670
I'm asking you to help me.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.382
Help me find my girl. Reunite my family.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.550
Let me see what I can do.

16:13.097 --> 16:13.931
Thank you.

16:15.349 --> 16:19.103
So, if you saw the fog,

16:19.186 --> 16:21.855
then you must have
also seen the thunderbird?

16:21.939 --> 16:22.773
The what?

16:22.856 --> 16:25.734
The thunderbird that's
on the Shinnecock seal. Is it not?

16:26.402 --> 16:30.155
You tell me. I'm not Shinnecock.
I'm Hopi. My mom's Hopi.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.826
I was raised mostly by my dad.
White dude from Flagstaff.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.370
I mean, it's clear
we're supposed to work together.

16:36.453 --> 16:40.165
I guess the question is, on what?

16:40.249 --> 16:42.543
You see, with the Callings,
it's all connected.

16:42.626 --> 16:45.212
-It's just a matter of how.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.880
What did you say?

16:47.464 --> 16:50.718
It's all connected.
It's something my nephew used to say. Why?

16:53.303 --> 16:55.389
I think I know why
we were brought together.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.443
My dad didn't like me visiting the res.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.571
So Mom would try and pack so much
into those weekends.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.198
She said Hopi was living our values,

17:13.282 --> 17:15.701
speaking our language,
practicing our ceremonies.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.494
Hopi is all those things.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.539
She always said, "It's all connected."

17:22.958 --> 17:24.251
Where is she now?

17:24.334 --> 17:25.377
She got sick.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.047
Needed a bone marrow transplant,

17:28.130 --> 17:30.799
and all the hospitals in Arizona
said we were too late.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.970
I couldn't accept that,
so I found a specialist in New York.

17:35.721 --> 17:36.805
She's dying.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.683
Dying in some New York hospital.

17:40.893 --> 17:41.727
Alone.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.523
She's got you though, no?

17:47.024 --> 17:48.275
That's the worst part.

17:48.358 --> 17:49.777
I can't even visit.

17:50.944 --> 17:54.198
They'll flag the Registry,
and you'll get arrested.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.284
I think that I have a way
that I can get you in.

17:57.367 --> 18:00.120
I think that's why
the Callings brought us together.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.417
Okay.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.715
But one thing
my mom talked about was balance,

18:11.799 --> 18:13.801
in nature and in the world.

18:13.884 --> 18:17.179
And we were brought together, so maybe
I'm supposed to help you somehow.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.722
Yeah, maybe.

18:19.890 --> 18:23.060
We can figure that part out later.
I'll get back to you soon as I can, okay?

18:28.899 --> 18:33.278
Okay. So the first thing Dad saw
was the peacock,

18:33.362 --> 18:35.948
which is the symbol of resurrection.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.783
He saw it in a Calling.

18:37.866 --> 18:40.285
The peacock is also
the mythological messenger

18:40.369 --> 18:42.454
for the Roman goddess Juno.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.956
That is how we got June.

18:44.623 --> 18:48.335
And then Zeke and Mick saw the petroglyph
with the Gemini twins on it,

18:48.418 --> 18:49.586
which gave us the number two…

18:49.670 --> 18:53.590
…and then you had a calling
to build a wooden dragon.

18:53.674 --> 18:57.761
The year of the wooden dragon is 2024.
June 2nd, 2024.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.096
The Death Date.

18:59.179 --> 19:03.433
And speaking of… Chapter two in our story.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.310
Logan Strickland.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.313
Okay, he gave Aunt Mick this compass.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.440
He thought that it was gonna help
save the passengers.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.651
But on the back of the compass,

19:13.902 --> 19:14.736
a peacock,

19:14.820 --> 19:18.073
which then led me and TJ
to the Al-Zuras journal.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.618
Which then led us to the Silver Dragon.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.912
AKA the airplane.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.582
And we're right back where we started.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.585
We've been looking at everything
for hours, but it's not working.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.753
How is any of this
gonna give me the answer?

19:33.881 --> 19:34.882
Wait.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.345
This isn't everything.

19:58.488 --> 19:59.698
Keep this.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.162
See? If we didn't lay everything
out on the table,

20:05.245 --> 20:07.539
I would've never remembered
this card was in here.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.208
Now we have everything.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.584
Okay, so we were missing a card?

20:10.667 --> 20:12.544
It's not just a card.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.254
It's the Star card.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.216
Okay, it's not just like
any regular five-pointed star.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.259
The compass, the journal, this card.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.553
They all have
the same unique star on them.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.474
You kept this in here
instead of on the board

20:25.557 --> 20:26.808
because it was special to you.

20:27.434 --> 20:28.518
Because of Mom.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.104
Yeah.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.399
But I remembered it for a reason.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.986
We just gotta figure out
what that reason is.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.175
Woo!

21:00.259 --> 21:02.844
I am the director of driving.

21:02.928 --> 21:06.765
No, you are not if you can't even say
"designated driver."

21:06.848 --> 21:08.350
Okay. Okay.

21:08.433 --> 21:09.476
No, no, no, stop.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.855
Evie, stop! Evie, stop! Stop! Stop!

21:40.090 --> 21:41.008
What are we doing?

21:41.091 --> 21:43.844
Hey, man, I'm starving.
I heard this place is bomb.

21:43.927 --> 21:47.681
Better not be some fusion thing.
Don't need some chicken tikka ramen again.

21:51.977 --> 21:55.647
Yo, grab a spot in line.
I gotta grab something for the apartment.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.191
And, uh, break me off
a couple kimchi grilled cheeses, will you?

21:58.275 --> 21:59.401
Kimchi what?

22:06.408 --> 22:07.284
Excuse me.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.495
You the Lewis
who called the 828 Registry hotline?

22:11.121 --> 22:12.247
That'd be me.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.125
What can you tell me
about the suspicious fertilizer purchase?

22:15.959 --> 22:18.128
Well, I don't wanna be a nosy Pete.

22:18.211 --> 22:22.049
My gut was telling me
this purchase wasn't on the up-and-up.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.008
Why's that?

22:23.800 --> 22:26.845
Well, I found this lady
loading up on fertilizer.

22:26.928 --> 22:29.681
But when I tried to tell her
that the timing was a bit off,

22:29.765 --> 22:32.225
on account of winter
freezing up the ground for months,

22:32.309 --> 22:34.603
she just kept piling up her cart.

22:35.562 --> 22:36.730
She cleaned me out.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.941
Now, this fertilizer,
is it the kind with ammonium nitrate?

22:40.025 --> 22:41.485
Yes, sir. Like I said,

22:41.568 --> 22:44.112
I don't like to be nosy,
so I just rang her up.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.572
But you called it in later.

22:45.655 --> 22:49.951
Yeah. After she left,
one of my coworkers recognized her.

22:50.035 --> 22:53.246
He follows all of that 828,
you know, the website and stuff.

22:53.330 --> 22:56.792
He told me that I had to call it in.
See something, say something?

22:56.875 --> 23:00.128
I'm gonna need all video footage
and receipts of that time, sir.

23:00.212 --> 23:04.132
She paid in cash,
but I'll pull what footage we have.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.009
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.975
Robert Vance in the flesh.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.603
I should've known Ben would've run
to his government daddy.

23:16.686 --> 23:19.481
All we need to hear out of your mouth
is the location of my daughter.

23:19.564 --> 23:23.693
Manners, Ben. Remember the whole
leverage thing we talked about?

23:27.114 --> 23:30.575
This is a contingent authorization
for suspension of sentence

23:30.659 --> 23:31.701
and immediate release.

23:31.785 --> 23:35.414
If the information you provide
leads to a safe recovery of Eden Stone,

23:35.497 --> 23:37.624
you'll be a free man, Mr. Tehrani.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.503
Looks like we have the leverage now.

23:43.171 --> 23:44.005
Talk.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.634
For the record, I was right that day.

23:47.717 --> 23:50.971
The media, the police, the government,
they're all against us.

23:51.054 --> 23:53.473
You held a gun
to the head of a 15-year-old boy.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.058
There's nothing right about that.

23:55.142 --> 23:58.812
I thought you agency types
were comfortable with collateral damage.

23:58.895 --> 24:01.440
My son had nightmares for months.

24:02.065 --> 24:05.318
He still can't sleep through the night.
My wife blamed me for what you did.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.696
I no longer have a marriage
because of you.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.740
That is not collateral damage.

24:11.241 --> 24:15.412
That's the complete destruction
of a family. My family.

24:16.663 --> 24:17.622
Vance,

24:18.540 --> 24:19.749
I… I didn't know.

24:19.833 --> 24:22.752
How would you?
You only care about one thing.

24:23.587 --> 24:26.339
I'm glad one of us gets
to put our family back together.

24:33.513 --> 24:34.556
You heard him.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.602
You have a chance
to put your family back together, Ben.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.812
But not if you walk out that door.

24:46.067 --> 24:48.069
Get your stuff.
Let's go to the hospital now.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.155
-What's going on?
-I'll explain in the car. Come on.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.490
I don't understand.

24:51.573 --> 24:52.491
Kyle,

24:53.950 --> 24:56.369
we don't know how long we have
with the ones that we love.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.580
All we have is this present moment.
Trust me.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.707
I know that
because of the mistakes that I've made.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.667
All I can do is stop you
from making your own.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.964
Okay, I'll grab my jacket.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.889
Vance might wanna put away his hankie.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.390
We've all got problems,

25:17.474 --> 25:20.393
but you have an opportunity
to solve yours.

25:20.477 --> 25:23.188
Without my intel, you've got nothing.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.565
Back to yelling into the abyss.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.401
You need this, Ben.

25:29.277 --> 25:30.362
You need me.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.795
Sign it and give me the location.

25:48.838 --> 25:50.006
A deal's a deal.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.944
See you on the outside, professor.

26:17.158 --> 26:18.368
Aah!

26:23.582 --> 26:24.541
You get it?

26:25.542 --> 26:26.459
Yeah.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.712
Then I'll start submitting the paperwork,

26:28.795 --> 26:30.964
but we won't be able to finalize anything

26:31.047 --> 26:33.592
until this information
proves to be credible.

26:33.675 --> 26:34.759
Thanks, fellas.

26:35.343 --> 26:38.638
Just so we're clear, you cashed in
all your reserves on this one.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.140
I hope it was worth it.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.602
-Vance…
-No, forget it.

26:43.685 --> 26:44.561
No, no. No.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.690
I became so consumed in my own nightmare,

26:48.773 --> 26:51.484
I couldn't see what you were dealing with.
I'm sorry.

26:51.568 --> 26:54.404
Let's just focus on your daughter.
Where we headed?

26:54.988 --> 26:57.240
Yeah. Yeah, I'll text it to you.

26:57.324 --> 26:58.658
But, Vance,

27:00.201 --> 27:01.453
I want you to know

27:02.329 --> 27:04.331
I'll never forget what you did for me.

27:16.843 --> 27:19.012
Turns out they didn't have
that scooper thing I wanted.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.056
You mean a hand trowel?

27:21.556 --> 27:22.974
Yeah, that's the one.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.434
You think I'm an idiot?

27:25.602 --> 27:28.980
-What?
-You heard me. Do you think I'm an idiot?

27:29.064 --> 27:31.566
Or do you just like feeding me
line after line?

27:32.192 --> 27:33.193
We're partners,

27:33.276 --> 27:35.779
and these little side investigations
you got going on,

27:36.905 --> 27:40.116
they could cost more than just your job.
They could cost my job.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.036
That's not gonna happen, Diaz.

27:43.536 --> 27:46.164
It already happened.
Remember when you were a lieutenant?

27:46.706 --> 27:50.293
I don't wanna get dragged down with you
any further than you are. Understood?

27:52.587 --> 27:53.588
Yeah.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.299
Good. You're just lucky.

27:57.258 --> 27:58.843
That kimchi grilled cheese is banging.

28:08.895 --> 28:11.606
-Zeke Landon. Here to see a patient.
-Name?

28:15.110 --> 28:16.403
Haskins. Room 712.

28:51.312 --> 28:52.272
Mom?

28:55.150 --> 28:56.151
It's all right.

29:00.739 --> 29:01.698
You were right, Mom.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.033
We should have come sooner.

29:04.617 --> 29:07.120
This is all my fault. I'm sorry.

29:07.954 --> 29:09.038
Forgive me, Mom.

29:17.046 --> 29:19.299
If you're open to it,
I might be able to help.

29:22.135 --> 29:23.011
Help how?

29:23.094 --> 29:24.512
It's hard to explain.

29:25.221 --> 29:26.389
Better if I show you.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.126
Kyle.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.254
Your mom, she has such deep love for you.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.174
Love and gratitude.

30:01.257 --> 30:04.844
There's no blame. No guilt. No anger.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.554
All her pain is gone.

30:08.973 --> 30:09.974
Home.

30:17.482 --> 30:18.983
You should be on your land.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.319
With me.

30:25.031 --> 30:26.241
Let's take you home.

30:35.917 --> 30:39.128
Thank you. But I don't understand.
How did you do that?

30:39.879 --> 30:43.883
Not sure I understand it myself.
Just found I could one day.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.854
It's not a good time, Zeke.

30:56.563 --> 30:57.564
I know.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.441
So what do you want?

31:01.025 --> 31:02.986
I can't even begin to imagine
what it's like

31:03.069 --> 31:05.655
to have a parent ripped away from you
at your age.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.615
Then why are you talking?

31:08.116 --> 31:10.577
Because I know
what it's like to lose a sibling.

31:11.077 --> 31:15.373
I know how easy it is to lose yourself
after such a profound tragedy.

31:16.207 --> 31:19.919
My entire life has been torn apart.

31:21.588 --> 31:25.466
I'm supposed to be some college kid,
running late to whatever 101s

31:25.550 --> 31:29.137
and going to a bunch of parties
with lots of my friends.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.597
Instead, I'm here.

31:31.723 --> 31:37.228
I'm here playing parent to the brother
that has completely destroyed my life

31:37.729 --> 31:42.525
because I have no idea when my dad
is gonna get his back on track!

31:43.943 --> 31:45.528
You really know all that?

31:56.664 --> 31:57.916
I know this.

31:59.709 --> 32:01.836
You still have people that love you.

32:02.879 --> 32:05.131
People who remember the real you.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.843
Loving, warm, compassionate.

32:10.178 --> 32:12.430
Maybe we just need
to reintroduce ourselves.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.476
Come on. I'm Zeke Landon.

32:29.405 --> 32:30.782
Did you… did you feel that?

32:31.908 --> 32:33.034
Yeah.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.954
I… I feel different.

32:36.579 --> 32:38.122
What did you do?

32:38.206 --> 32:39.332
I don't know.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.460
That's the first time
I've ever felt something like that.

32:43.753 --> 32:46.923
Well, whatever just happened,

32:48.508 --> 32:49.467
thank you.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.483
I don't care about protocol.

33:05.566 --> 33:08.695
I have power of attorney,
and I'd like to take her home immediately.

33:08.778 --> 33:10.071
I have to call the doctor.

33:10.154 --> 33:12.323
And we might have to bring
the administration in on this.

33:12.407 --> 33:13.616
Your name?

33:17.495 --> 33:18.746
Kyle Boyd.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.963
Kyle, if you go through with this,
your name ends up in the system.

33:27.046 --> 33:28.297
The Registry will be informed.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.425
They don't care if locking you up
means your mom--

33:30.508 --> 33:31.676
She can't die here.

33:32.927 --> 33:34.762
I'm not gonna fail her again.

33:40.268 --> 33:41.102
Hey.

33:41.185 --> 33:43.813
Just about loaded up.
Where's that address?

33:43.896 --> 33:46.357
Yeah, I'm gonna text it to you now.

33:46.441 --> 33:47.692
All right. See you there.

33:47.775 --> 33:48.735
<i>Hey, Vance?</i>

33:48.818 --> 33:49.736
Yeah?

33:50.862 --> 33:51.779
Thank you.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.032
Thank me when this is over.

34:29.692 --> 34:32.153
Zeke, you better hurry. I don't know
how much time we have.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.615
-<i>Mick, you still there?</i>
Excuse me. Where's Virginia Boyd?

34:35.698 --> 34:36.616
<i>Mick?</i>

34:41.871 --> 34:45.041
Check the hallways and the stairs. They
couldn't have gone far. I want them found.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.253
And you, inside now.

34:52.965 --> 34:54.383
I called to check on my friend,

34:54.467 --> 34:58.096
and somehow that leads to me being put
in a very compromising situation.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.515
I'll try not to let it happen again.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.643
I just hope it was enough.

35:03.726 --> 35:06.479
Should be. Sounds like Zeke got them
in the cab before you showed up,

35:06.562 --> 35:08.564
so… thank you.

35:08.648 --> 35:12.068
And not just for letting Kyle take
his mom home, but for all you do for us.

35:13.111 --> 35:13.986
It's the right thing.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.241
Just consider yourself lucky
I'm not arresting you.

35:50.148 --> 35:50.982
Anything?

35:53.526 --> 35:56.070
I know. I know stressing out
isn't gonna help,

35:56.154 --> 35:57.446
but this isn't working.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.198
Hey, look at me.

35:59.282 --> 36:01.159
The answer is gonna come.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.119
But it won't if you're all worked up.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.415
Now repeat after me.
We are going to figure this out.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.083
We're going to figure this out.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.670
I have the best sister
in the entire world.

36:12.753 --> 36:15.464
I have the best sister
in the whole entire world.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.302
You know, sometimes it's hard
to see things for what they are.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.512
Maybe we should change perspective.

36:28.686 --> 36:29.979
Somebody see a mouse?

36:30.062 --> 36:32.565
Well, at least that'd be a discovery.
You go shopping?

36:32.648 --> 36:36.986
Oh, no. It's a gift from someone
I helped solve a Calling.

36:37.486 --> 36:39.697
How's it going here?
Any closer to some answers?

36:39.780 --> 36:43.242
We'll figure it out.
Just might take a little while.

36:43.326 --> 36:47.580
Well, that sounds like an adventure
for another day. I'm gonna go to bed.

36:50.416 --> 36:51.459
What?

36:51.542 --> 36:53.461
Just good to see you two working together.

37:05.806 --> 37:07.975
<i>Today was a lot. You okay?</i>

37:08.643 --> 37:10.728
It was. Yeah, I'm fine.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.742
Just so you're aware,
when I ask if you're okay,

37:24.825 --> 37:28.454
I'm just opening the door to conversation.
I already know you're not.

37:34.961 --> 37:35.920
Okay.

37:38.464 --> 37:40.007
Try this one on, then.

37:40.591 --> 37:46.472
I think, um, hearing Kyle finally telling
his mom everything he needed to say…

37:48.474 --> 37:49.934
…letting go of the guilt…

37:52.103 --> 37:54.063
I realized that the Callings…

37:56.148 --> 37:57.608
they wanted me to see that

37:57.692 --> 37:59.610
just as much as
they wanted me to help him.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.405
Like, maybe I'm supposed to do the same.

38:02.905 --> 38:04.365
With Evie?

38:05.199 --> 38:06.784
I thought that I had.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.873
I tried really hard.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.168
What if I'm not ready?

38:17.712 --> 38:21.299
What if…
what if I don't wanna let go of the guilt

38:21.382 --> 38:22.425
because…

38:25.386 --> 38:27.388
it's the only thing I have left?

38:27.972 --> 38:30.850
If I let it go, then there's
nothing connecting me to her.

38:34.061 --> 38:34.895
Then don't.

38:36.105 --> 38:37.106
Don't…

38:37.189 --> 38:38.482
Don't let go.

38:38.566 --> 38:42.111
Hang on to the guilt if you need to.
There's no shame in that.

38:42.611 --> 38:45.406
Believe me, I carry my guilt
all over the place.

38:46.991 --> 38:50.369
It's a part of us, and you can use
that part however you want.

38:50.953 --> 38:53.456
Our pain can become our strength.

38:55.249 --> 38:58.002
This is your life. Live it by your truth.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.762
Three klicks out.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.513
The hell are you?

39:13.392 --> 39:15.728
<i>Hi, this is Ben Stone.</i>
<i>I can't answer the phone--</i>

39:29.742 --> 39:31.035
Is that…

39:31.744 --> 39:32.995
A star…

39:34.538 --> 39:37.708
with four major points
and four minor ones.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.669
Like a directional star on a compass.

39:43.756 --> 39:47.468
What is that on top of it?
It kind of seems like it's a…

39:48.552 --> 39:49.720
A button.

39:58.104 --> 40:00.481
<i>"Divina conciencia"?</i>

40:00.564 --> 40:02.525
My Latin is a little rusty.

40:04.944 --> 40:06.821
Divine consciousness.

40:08.072 --> 40:10.282
According to tarot,

40:10.366 --> 40:12.368
the Star card,
it represents enlightenment,

40:12.451 --> 40:14.787
which means that if you have this card,

40:14.870 --> 40:18.916
you are directly connected
to divine consciousness.

40:20.167 --> 40:22.128
You already have the answer.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.265
What? Cal, what are you seeing?

40:37.143 --> 40:38.352
The glow.

40:41.647 --> 40:45.317
The glow from outside the plane.
The glow right in front of me.

40:45.401 --> 40:48.028
It's all one. It's all connected.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.739
That's where we were, inside the glow.

40:50.823 --> 40:53.075
Like, what? Like, you and Daly and Fiona?

40:53.159 --> 40:55.744
No. It's more than that. All of us.

40:55.828 --> 40:58.205
I know where the plane was
for five and a half years.

40:58.289 --> 41:01.584
We were in the divine consciousness.

41:18.267 --> 41:21.061
-Sure this is right?

41:24.857 --> 41:26.442
-Ben?
-Listen.

41:26.525 --> 41:28.986
<i>We're at the location.</i>
<i>Where are you? What's going on?</i>

41:29.069 --> 41:31.906
-You're not gonna find anyone there.
-What the hell did you do, Ben?

41:31.989 --> 41:35.367
-I knew you wouldn't let me go on my own.
-On your own? No, wait.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.119
<i>I'm so grateful for all you've done,</i>

41:37.703 --> 41:38.913
but I had a Calling.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.081
Something bad's gonna happen.

41:41.165 --> 41:44.084
<i>And I'm not gonna put you</i>
<i>or anyone else I love in danger.</i>

41:44.168 --> 41:45.211
Where are you?

41:47.880 --> 41:50.424
You've sacrificed enough for me
and my family already.

41:51.759 --> 41:54.178
-God damn it, Ben!
What happened?

41:54.261 --> 41:56.055
He's going it alone.

42:12.321 --> 42:13.364
<i>Where are you?</i>

42:16.659 --> 42:18.869
The store clerk sent me some pics.

42:19.662 --> 42:21.163
I thought you were gonna squash this,

42:21.247 --> 42:23.415
not open up
a whole can of detective on it.

42:23.499 --> 42:25.876
It's not like I was looking
for the lead to be legit.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.504
You know when you get that feeling.
Ah, here it is.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.257
Oh, definitely worth a visit.

42:32.841 --> 42:33.801
I know her.

42:34.343 --> 42:35.511
What? Who is it?

42:36.971 --> 42:38.472
Erika Burness.

42:38.556 --> 42:41.684
I interrogated her after she robbed
that gun store with her boyfriend,

42:41.767 --> 42:43.561
who almost killed Vance's son.

42:48.524 --> 42:51.026
-I'll be damned.
-Landlord Adrian Shannon.

42:51.735 --> 42:53.237
Funny, trouble always finds this guy.

42:53.320 --> 42:55.823
So Erika is living with him?
What are they up to?

42:56.824 --> 42:58.242
We're about to find out.

43:00.911 --> 43:02.204
There you are.
