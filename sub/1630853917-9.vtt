WEBVTT

00:24.608 --> 00:25.776
This is to tie it up.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.987
Oh, no! And what happened there?

00:32.908 --> 00:34.243
It's weird she hasn't called.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.747
You'd call us if Donal
didn't come home one night, right?

00:38.830 --> 00:40.123
Don't know. Would I?

00:42.251 --> 00:44.920
She'll probably call the police first,
right?

00:48.590 --> 00:49.800
Are you not talking to me?

00:49.883 --> 00:53.178
I am talking to you. I'm still processing.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.722
You shouldn't have let her go rogue.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.933
Now she's got to
carry that burden of guilt.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.143
You weren't concerned about me
when I was going to shoot him.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.353
Or me.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.938
Well, she's younger than…

01:04.313 --> 01:05.732
She's practically a kid.

01:05.816 --> 01:08.902
She's 29.
What's the cutoff age for killing a man?

01:08.986 --> 01:10.779
Anyway, we're not a firing squad.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.199
We always knew one of us
would get the final bullet.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.285
Nice.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.287
Becka.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.581
Wait. Becka, wait!

02:45.582 --> 02:47.835
-I can't breathe.
-There must've been tools in there!

02:47.918 --> 02:50.128
-Was there tools in there?
-There's no tools. We checked!

02:50.212 --> 02:52.506
-What happened?
-He's unkillable. He's like a cockroach.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.924
Someone was in that room!

02:55.843 --> 02:57.052
What if it was Minna?

02:58.470 --> 02:59.471
What am I missing?

03:00.305 --> 03:02.391
Birthday planning!
Get back in there, you big eavesdropper.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.684
Get in.

03:03.767 --> 03:04.935
-Get in!
-Sorry!

03:06.186 --> 03:07.521
I have to go over there.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.524
-No, wait. What do--
-Why is he here? He never comes.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.317
It doesn't matter.
It's good that he's here.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.862
We'll keep him here
while you check on Minna, okay?

03:14.945 --> 03:18.156
Okay, look, walk! Don't run.
We're gonna say you're sick.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.825
I actually do feel sick.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.702
What?

03:21.785 --> 03:23.871
-Right, kids, dinner!
-Coming now!

03:24.621 --> 03:27.082
So, Blanaid, did your daddy threaten
to cancel your pocket money?

03:27.165 --> 03:28.166
Is that what happened?

03:28.250 --> 03:29.293
Fat chance.

03:30.043 --> 03:36.049
Road rage incident. Very angry chap.
Got his license number though.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.553
JP, why don't you take a seat?

03:40.095 --> 03:43.807
No, I'm not staying.
I'm headed over to my mum's.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.435
No. What? Stay.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.645
You can have Becka's seat.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.147
Oh, yeah.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.982
That's a great idea, JP. Stay.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.692
No. I just wanted to drop the girls off.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.612
I need to bring Mum her shopping.
Should've done it last night.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.792
Minna!

04:13.086 --> 04:14.338
Minna, it's me!

04:16.464 --> 04:17.423
Minna!

04:47.913 --> 04:50.624
You called Becka.
Leave a message, you weirdo.

04:50.707 --> 04:54.086
Becka, he's going round there,
so just-- please--

04:54.169 --> 04:56.463
just listen to this bloody message!

05:00.008 --> 05:01.134
Hey!

05:01.218 --> 05:02.719
Will we serve up dessert?

05:03.220 --> 05:05.472
Absolutely. Yeah, get stuck in.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.269
Everyone's a bit weird today.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.603
Are they?

05:12.479 --> 05:14.690
I don't know why.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.359
Oh, my God.

05:24.700 --> 05:28.662
-Mama! Where are you?
-Oh, shit.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.207
Where are you?
I've got some groceries for you.

05:32.291 --> 05:33.375
Got some…

05:34.168 --> 05:35.210
Soggy.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.965
Looks like you'll be eating fish fingers
for a few days.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.425
Mama!

05:48.807 --> 05:49.892
Mama!

05:50.475 --> 05:52.519
-Shit.
-Mama!

05:52.603 --> 05:53.729
Where are you?

06:14.708 --> 06:15.709
Mama!

07:35.581 --> 07:38.876
But Mama, what are you doing?

07:44.923 --> 07:46.383
What are you doing, Mama?

07:54.683 --> 07:55.851
Oh, you're so cold!

08:43.315 --> 08:44.942
Hi. I thought I'd check in on Min.

08:45.442 --> 08:46.985
I thought you were sick.

08:47.653 --> 08:48.737
Sick of my sisters.

08:49.488 --> 08:50.781
Felt like a Minna day.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.369
She's sleeping.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.745
-I'll come in and wait.
-No.

08:56.828 --> 08:59.456
Don't like you hanging around here,
giving her ideas.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.124
Go away.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.394
Fuck!

09:37.369 --> 09:39.288
Oh, Becka. Thank Christ!

09:39.371 --> 09:40.706
He said she's sleeping.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.541
What, you talked to him?

09:42.624 --> 09:44.334
-I need to know.
-What did you say to him?

09:44.418 --> 09:46.628
Nothing.
I just said I fancied a Minna day.

09:46.712 --> 09:48.172
I have to get in that house.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.340
Look. I know this is awful, not knowing,

09:50.424 --> 09:53.218
but forcing your way in there
is only going to make things worse.

09:53.302 --> 09:54.303
She's right.

09:54.386 --> 09:57.598
We just need to act like normal, okay?
Wait it out.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.349
Go in and lie down.
I'll get you a plate of food.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.392
I can't eat.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.811
Well,
then I will bring you a box of wine, okay?

10:02.895 --> 10:04.813
-Just go and lie down.
-I can't lie down.

10:04.897 --> 10:07.191
Well, just pace about then,
but do it here.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.234
Not outside Minna's.

10:12.029 --> 10:15.365
-If Minna's in there--
-I can't even think about that.

10:15.449 --> 10:19.828
-I'm saying he might suspect--
-No. It looked like an accident.

10:20.913 --> 10:22.289
If she is in there,

10:23.582 --> 10:25.459
then he's the one with the problem.

11:04.248 --> 11:05.624
What the…

11:28.313 --> 11:30.107
What service do you require?

11:31.483 --> 11:34.736
I just found my mother
unresponsive in bed.

11:38.490 --> 11:42.286
I think she may have died
in her sleep last night.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.496
When was she last conscious? Do you know?

11:46.164 --> 11:49.626
Hello? Excuse me, sir,
are you still there?

12:03.223 --> 12:04.474
Answer it.

12:07.561 --> 12:08.854
Hey, honey.

12:08.937 --> 12:11.815
I'm just here with all the girls.
You all right?

12:12.733 --> 12:17.279
I'm glad you're together.
I didn't want Becka to be on her own.

12:18.113 --> 12:20.741
Becka, Minna's dead.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.326
No. Grace.

12:23.035 --> 12:25.329
She passed away last night in her sleep.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.080
-In her sleep?
-I'm so sorry.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.751
If there's anything we can do, just--

12:30.834 --> 12:34.171
John Paul needs me now. Talk later, okay?

12:34.713 --> 12:36.006
Okay, honey. We love you.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.427
Oh, Becka.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.931
What have I done?

12:44.014 --> 12:47.017
Listen to me!
None of this would have happened

12:47.100 --> 12:50.062
if the prick hadn't have
locked his dead dad in a fucking freezer!

12:50.145 --> 12:53.524
She must have known George was in there.
She must have gone to see him.

12:53.607 --> 12:57.402
-I know. Yeah.
-Or maybe she actually died in bed.

12:58.153 --> 13:01.907
Christ's sake. He's covering his tracks!

13:01.990 --> 13:05.577
No, he can't.
He can't get away with this too.

13:05.661 --> 13:08.622
I mean, if he's gonna lie about Minna,
then I'll tell the truth about George.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.250
I'll take him down even if I go down too.

13:11.333 --> 13:14.127
No, because if you go down,
we all go down.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.629
Shut up, Ursula!

13:15.712 --> 13:17.881
We need to get in there
before he moves his body.

13:17.965 --> 13:21.176
-And do what?
-I don't know! Photograph it!

13:21.260 --> 13:24.429
And then what? We can't go to the police.

13:24.513 --> 13:26.014
You do get that, don't you, Becka?

13:26.098 --> 13:27.307
I don't want to hear her.

13:27.391 --> 13:29.309
Just, please.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.981
Okay. Better we have a photograph
than no photograph.

13:34.064 --> 13:35.858
-No.
-Just so we have something

13:35.941 --> 13:37.651
to use against him if we need it.

13:37.734 --> 13:38.861
No, it's too risky.

13:38.944 --> 13:41.321
Well, I'm going over there
with or without you lot.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.866
No, I'll come with you. Okay?

13:49.621 --> 13:51.540
What the hell? Where is he?

13:53.292 --> 13:54.918
I can't believe this is happening.

13:57.838 --> 13:58.839
Becka.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.551
I need to get out of here.

14:02.634 --> 14:03.635
Okay.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.274
Oh, shit.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.110
What are you doing here?

14:20.194 --> 14:22.154
-We were just--
-I wanted to see the--

14:22.237 --> 14:23.530
See what?

14:23.614 --> 14:26.950
We were just-- Becka thought she left some
massage equipment here, so we--

14:27.034 --> 14:29.244
What? In the freezer room?

14:31.538 --> 14:35.125
We didn't go into any freezer room.
We were just going. Sorry.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.005
Becka, I know you were here last night.

14:43.509 --> 14:45.636
You pierced her nose.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.888
I took it out
'cause it made her look cheap.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.642
Sorry for your loss.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.323
He knows. He bloody knows.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.450
What else would we be doing down there?

15:08.534 --> 15:11.203
-He knows we know about George.
-I don't care if he knows.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.121
I care that Minna is dead.

15:13.205 --> 15:15.123
-I care that I did it.
-Yeah, we did it.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.376
You didn't even know about it.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.712
I started this. We are all guilty.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.550
Oh, shit. Does he know that?
I mean, does he know that we--

15:24.633 --> 15:26.093
Stop talking about him.

15:27.845 --> 15:29.972
My heart is gonna break, Eva.

15:32.182 --> 15:35.102
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

15:37.396 --> 15:38.397
Sorry, Becka.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.734
Becka.

15:45.529 --> 15:46.572
Becka!

17:01.063 --> 17:02.689
You totally went off radar.

17:04.358 --> 17:06.401
You didn't tell me you dug up JP's body.

17:07.069 --> 17:10.948
So tell me the truth
because my brother is losing his mind.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.576
Funny enough, Matt,
I don't care about your brother.

17:15.452 --> 17:16.619
I care about my sister.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.789
You're not paying her
what she's due. Why's that?

17:19.998 --> 17:22.501
You were at the marina
the night JP took a dip.

17:22.584 --> 17:24.002
Gabriel saw you with Eva.

17:24.586 --> 17:28.006
Yeah, we were out driving or messing.
I was pissed.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.510
I made Eva take me to Gabriel's boat.
I thought we could have a drink on board.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.470
So, you didn't see JP's car?

17:33.554 --> 17:36.056
We didn't notice any cars.
We were looking at the boats.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.141
Why are you asking?

17:38.225 --> 17:40.811
And this bullshit friendship with Minna.
What was that about?

17:41.395 --> 17:43.021
It wasn't a bullshit friendship.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.820
I saw the check she made out to you,
Becka.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.363
The antique check?

17:53.323 --> 17:55.117
Did you notice it wasn't cashed?

17:56.034 --> 17:57.494
You wouldn't understand anything
about that

17:57.578 --> 17:59.830
because all you and your brother
can think about is money.

17:59.913 --> 18:03.083
Coming from the woman who was happy
to take a handout from a man she hated.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.001
That's not what--

18:04.084 --> 18:06.461
Was it a coincidence
she died a few weeks before John Paul--

18:06.545 --> 18:09.923
-Yes, it was a fucking coincidence!
-You're a hypocrite, Becka!

18:10.007 --> 18:11.341
And you use people.

18:11.425 --> 18:13.886
You saw Minna and took an opportunity.
You're doing the same with me.

18:13.969 --> 18:16.847
You're the hypocrite!
You pretended to like me.

18:18.348 --> 18:21.685
-Minna was my friend, and I miss her!
-Stop, Becka.

18:22.603 --> 18:24.938
-I miss her!
-Stop.

18:26.523 --> 18:27.941
I'm sorry.

18:33.405 --> 18:34.323
I'm sorry.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.451
Hey. Is everything okay?

19:20.160 --> 19:21.161
Yeah.

19:23.705 --> 19:24.873
Where are you?

19:27.459 --> 19:28.627
You're with her.

19:31.046 --> 19:34.049
-Yeah.
-You're a fool. She's lying to you.

19:34.132 --> 19:37.386
They killed him in Wicklow.
I can't prove it, but I know they did it.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.732
Someone want a little cuddle?

20:10.794 --> 20:12.588
Tom?

20:17.426 --> 20:19.636
You have to pay out? Is that what this is?

20:22.222 --> 20:25.893
Okay, so… we're bankrupt.

20:27.102 --> 20:28.854
Well, at least it's done. Over.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.230
I've been trying so hard.

20:30.898 --> 20:32.232
I don't care.

20:33.317 --> 20:36.278
I care about you and having this baby.

20:37.196 --> 20:38.488
Look, come here.

20:39.948 --> 20:42.576
We can live in a box out the back
of a Harvey Norman.

20:42.659 --> 20:45.245
I don't give a shit
as long as I have you both.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.629
Matt's in love with the Garvey girl.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.214
Well, I told you that.

20:56.465 --> 20:58.592
I'd like a face-to-face
with those Garveys.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.553
What is she like?

21:01.637 --> 21:04.556
Aside from being an accomplice to murder?

21:04.640 --> 21:05.807
I don't know. Fit?

21:11.522 --> 21:13.232
There's something else, isn't there?

21:22.366 --> 21:25.494
If we can't pay the Williams claim,
there will be an investigation.

21:26.787 --> 21:28.288
-Right. And?
-And…

21:30.457 --> 21:31.959
well, they'll find a mess.

21:33.460 --> 21:36.129
-What kind of mess?
-A fraudulent mess.

21:38.841 --> 21:42.678
The Williams case was never processed.
There was no cover.

21:43.554 --> 21:46.974
Dad just took the monthly payments,
and he spent them.

21:47.057 --> 21:48.892
If there's an investigation,

21:48.976 --> 21:51.645
they'll find that
and all the other policies

21:51.728 --> 21:53.772
that weren't worth the paper
they were written on.

21:53.856 --> 21:57.693
He embezzled his clients for years,
and I've helped to cover it up.

21:59.403 --> 22:01.405
Are you talking jail time, Thomas?

22:16.211 --> 22:19.006
-Sorry for your loss.
-Don't bring him on us, Eva.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.636
Come here.

22:25.637 --> 22:26.638
Poor little thing.

22:33.353 --> 22:34.563
Urs isn't coming.

22:35.981 --> 22:38.066
Why? It's so much fun.

22:40.277 --> 22:41.904
Minna would've hated this.

22:44.740 --> 22:46.450
She deserved a proper send-off.

22:46.533 --> 22:49.203
Yeah. A dry funeral.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.456
She was always half-pissed
every time I saw her.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.041
She had dementia, Bibi.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.293
No, I mean on top of that.

22:58.337 --> 23:01.840
This was her favorite.
I'll drink to her if no one else will.

23:01.924 --> 23:03.550
That's not gonna help, honey.

23:05.302 --> 23:07.095
That is rich coming from you.

23:11.517 --> 23:13.185
I need a breather from her.

23:13.268 --> 23:15.604
Make sure she doesn't do anything stupid.

23:31.703 --> 23:33.580
-What happened?
-Doesn't matter.

23:34.248 --> 23:36.500
He's calling it a road rage incident.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.835
I had a word with him.

23:37.918 --> 23:39.878
-What did you say?
-I told him to stay away.

23:39.962 --> 23:41.547
-And then you hit him?
-Yes, I hit him.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.173
Christ's sake, Ben.

23:43.882 --> 23:45.551
Why did you have to fan the flame?

23:48.345 --> 23:49.429
Did anyone see you?

23:50.430 --> 23:52.099
What do you expect me to do?

23:52.724 --> 23:55.561
After what he did to you,
the scumbag should be in jail.

24:00.524 --> 24:01.567
Show me your hand.

24:13.996 --> 24:15.163
You did that for me?

24:25.132 --> 24:26.758
I'd do anything for you, Urs.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.442
People keep saying it was her time.

24:45.110 --> 24:46.737
Well, she had a long life.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.572
But she wasn't ready to die.

24:49.364 --> 24:52.659
I think your mother died the day
you told her that George had left her.

24:52.743 --> 24:55.037
All she did was find her way back to him.

24:55.871 --> 24:57.080
Hey.

24:57.581 --> 24:59.124
Hey. You okay?

24:59.208 --> 25:01.335
I'm grand, really.
I'm just worried about this man.

25:01.418 --> 25:02.252
Yeah.

25:02.336 --> 25:03.754
Let's get away, Mammy.

25:04.421 --> 25:07.883
Go up to the cabin for your birthday.
Dust off the quad bike.

25:07.966 --> 25:09.259
Well, she hates quad biking.

25:10.135 --> 25:13.931
And she's gonna be spending her birthday
with her sisters like she always does.

25:14.014 --> 25:16.266
She's my wife, and she spends it with me.

25:16.350 --> 25:18.519
Cabin's not ready. It's a building site.

25:18.602 --> 25:20.437
Just needs a woman's touch, really.

25:20.521 --> 25:23.148
Well, how about you lot
join us the next morning,

25:23.232 --> 25:25.400
and we could have a half day
at the hotel spa?

25:25.484 --> 25:27.861
Oh, my God. Do you remember my 35th?

25:28.529 --> 25:31.657
We all got drunk at the bar
and then went back to the cabin.

25:31.740 --> 25:34.409
We're not doing a rerun
of that car crash of a night.

25:35.118 --> 25:37.746
No drunken stragglers this time.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.332
I'm fine. I'll see you later.

25:42.042 --> 25:43.043
Eva.

25:45.212 --> 25:46.213
She's upset.

25:46.296 --> 25:49.758
-Okay. I love you. Yeah, do.
-I'll call you. I love you.

25:49.842 --> 25:50.676
Becka!

25:50.759 --> 25:52.135
You all right, Pebble?

25:53.428 --> 25:55.931
Yeah, we're okay.
I'm worried about John Paul and…

25:57.099 --> 25:58.100
Grace.

26:14.199 --> 26:15.200
Oscar.

26:26.044 --> 26:28.130
We are restructuring, Eva.

26:29.673 --> 26:32.676
Where formerly, staff came to you
to sign off on client accounts,

26:32.759 --> 26:34.678
they will now come to me.

26:35.846 --> 26:37.514
And that includes you.

26:39.474 --> 26:41.268
And you agree to this?

26:41.768 --> 26:44.646
JP says there have been
some errors of late--

26:44.730 --> 26:47.941
-What, and you believe him?
-Yes, I believe him, Eva.

26:48.025 --> 26:51.612
You've been distracted recently.
Not yourself at all, if I'm honest.

26:52.529 --> 26:55.199
And there's been complaints.

26:55.699 --> 26:57.910
There's been complaints?
Well, what exactly--

26:57.993 --> 27:02.247
From clients about
the smell of drink off you.

27:03.123 --> 27:06.960
And not just your breath.
You're sweating alcohol, it seems…

27:09.379 --> 27:10.631
which says something.

27:18.555 --> 27:20.891
Eva.

27:45.624 --> 27:47.167
Grace will be upset by this,

27:47.251 --> 27:49.628
so I hope we can keep it civil
for her sake.

27:49.711 --> 27:53.549
Because, Eva, I'm not going anywhere.

27:54.883 --> 27:57.719
I know Becka was there
the night that Minna died,

27:57.803 --> 27:59.930
and I wondered,
"Why would she want to hurt Minna?"

28:00.013 --> 28:01.014
But there's no answer.

28:01.098 --> 28:04.059
And then I had this strange memory
of seeing her in my bedroom

28:04.142 --> 28:05.853
the night I fell into the marina.

28:05.936 --> 28:09.565
And I thought, "Come on.
Don't be stupid. How could that be?"

28:09.648 --> 28:13.402
But here she is again, one more time,
in a place where she shouldn't be.

28:14.236 --> 28:17.364
And then,
I remembered something else this morning.

28:18.407 --> 28:22.494
I remembered
the Garvey girls are like rats.

28:23.120 --> 28:27.207
Where there's one, there's more,
which is why you need to poison the nest.

28:28.250 --> 28:32.087
Get away from my car,
or I will mow you down like roadkill.

28:32.171 --> 28:34.756
Okay, sure. No problem. Please.

28:51.315 --> 28:54.860
-Emergency. Which service?
-Jesus, that was quick.

28:55.652 --> 28:58.488
It's okay. You're here.

29:03.911 --> 29:07.289
Yeah, no. Okay.
We're not doing that. No, okay, we got it.

29:07.372 --> 29:09.791
Kept him in the freezer for years.

29:09.875 --> 29:12.794
Jesus Christ. That's why she--

29:12.878 --> 29:13.879
Sorry!

29:15.422 --> 29:16.632
Thank you!

29:17.382 --> 29:19.968
I didn't believe her about George, Eva.

29:20.052 --> 29:21.178
Okay.

29:21.762 --> 29:26.266
God. Her friend died recently, so she's--

29:26.350 --> 29:29.311
She's been sick,
so should be the worst of it over.

29:29.394 --> 29:31.563
-Okay.
-It was all over the grave though,

29:31.647 --> 29:33.857
so you might want to call Father Doyle
in the morning.

29:33.941 --> 29:36.151
Offer to sluice it out or…

29:36.235 --> 29:39.279
Father D-- Yeah. No, I will.
I'll do that. Yeah.

29:39.363 --> 29:43.158
They're not listening to me!
Tell them I killed Minna.

29:43.242 --> 29:44.868
I'll kill you in a second.

29:44.952 --> 29:47.329
Hey, do you know, if you have
any Dioralyte at home, that'll help.

29:48.038 --> 29:49.581
Brilliant idea. Thank you.

29:50.082 --> 29:51.792
Nice house!

29:51.875 --> 29:53.293
Thank you.

29:55.003 --> 29:56.421
Tell them!

29:56.505 --> 29:57.631
Please shut up.

29:59.383 --> 30:02.261
Oh, my God.
I can't believe she spoke to the police.

30:02.344 --> 30:05.806
-Just calm down. It was two local morons.
-She's a liability.

30:05.889 --> 30:08.600
I told you this is what would happen
if you involved her, didn't I?

30:08.684 --> 30:10.519
I am fucking here, you know.

30:10.602 --> 30:12.896
Look, I know this is hard,

30:12.980 --> 30:17.484
okay, but you are just gonna
have to find a way to carry it.

30:17.568 --> 30:19.236
That's easy for you to say.

30:19.319 --> 30:22.114
He didn't take your eye or blackmail you.

30:22.906 --> 30:24.449
Put blood on your hands.

30:29.955 --> 30:32.708
Sorry. I know what he did to you.

30:34.835 --> 30:36.628
Gabriel and your work.

30:40.924 --> 30:43.343
That euthanasia drug
that you were telling us about.

30:43.427 --> 30:45.512
-Can you get that at the hospital?
-What the hell, Eva?

30:45.596 --> 30:50.058
No, I'm gonna finish this.
I'm gonna do it this weekend in Wicklow.

30:50.142 --> 30:51.768
No.

30:51.852 --> 30:54.396
We are going there
to give Grace a decent birthday.

30:54.479 --> 30:57.274
What he said to me at work,
that was a threat.

30:57.357 --> 30:59.610
He is onto us now.

30:59.693 --> 31:01.612
-He's onto us?
-Well, what exactly does he know?

31:01.695 --> 31:04.406
-It's what he suspects.
-Which is what?

31:04.489 --> 31:06.783
That Becka had something
to do with Minna's death,

31:06.867 --> 31:09.161
-or that we're trying to kill him?
-I don't know.

31:09.244 --> 31:10.287
All of it.

31:12.122 --> 31:13.290
Can you get it?

31:13.373 --> 31:16.043
Pentobarbital? Not from work, no.

31:18.253 --> 31:20.631
-I know a dodgy vet. I could ask him.
-Oh, my--

31:22.257 --> 31:25.427
It's too dangerous to rush into it like
this. You're being completely reckless.

31:25.511 --> 31:27.763
You're the one who wanted him dead
in the first place.

31:27.846 --> 31:29.014
I could do it.

31:29.097 --> 31:31.058
I've got blood on my hands anyway.

31:31.975 --> 31:33.477
Might as well be hung for a sheep.

31:33.560 --> 31:34.728
No one's getting hung.

31:35.312 --> 31:36.855
This is mine.

31:36.939 --> 31:39.816
I can do this. I know I can.

31:39.900 --> 31:40.943
Is that a fact?

31:41.902 --> 31:44.655
'Cause right now, I think you are more
of a liability than she is.

31:45.531 --> 31:46.782
We are not doing it.

31:55.415 --> 31:56.667
Get the stuff.

32:05.092 --> 32:06.218
I'll be back in an hour.

32:06.301 --> 32:08.679
Don't look so worried.
I won't tell him anything.

32:09.346 --> 32:11.181
I just want to suss out the legalities.

32:11.807 --> 32:14.935
No point in having a solicitor for a pal
if you don't use them, right?

32:15.018 --> 32:16.520
You don't have pals.

32:17.521 --> 32:18.522
That's true.

32:19.189 --> 32:20.399
I love you, Thomas.

32:22.818 --> 32:23.986
I know.

32:46.550 --> 32:47.551
Okay.

33:32.471 --> 33:33.472
No.

33:44.233 --> 33:45.567
Gotcha, Becka Garvey.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.550
Forgot me bloody wallet.

34:10.300 --> 34:13.053
Figured I'd have to buy him a drink
at least or something.

34:14.263 --> 34:15.347
Theresa.

34:16.974 --> 34:20.893
Theresa!
Theresa, you okay? Can you hear me?

34:20.978 --> 34:24.857
Fuck! You're all right.

34:24.940 --> 34:27.525
-What service do you require?
-Hello? I need an ambulance!

34:28.025 --> 34:29.027
Thomas?

34:31.612 --> 34:32.447
Thomas!

34:32.531 --> 34:34.699
I felt a bit weird
picking out knickers for Theresa,

34:34.783 --> 34:37.536
-but I just closed my eyes.
-I haven't time for this shit.

34:38.120 --> 34:41.415
Hey, wait. Thomas. What's going on?

34:41.998 --> 34:43.792
-She had a seizure.
-What?

34:43.876 --> 34:48.463
I just had some 23-year-old
with the emotional depth of a Chihuahua

34:48.547 --> 34:49.547
lay it out for me.

34:49.630 --> 34:52.342
I could lose her. I could lose my baby.
I could lose them both.

34:52.426 --> 34:54.803
No, it won't--
You won't lose them, Thomas.

34:55.512 --> 34:57.848
She was going to see Becka Garvey.
Did you know that?

34:58.974 --> 35:01.685
That's what she was doing
before she collapsed.

35:01.768 --> 35:03.228
This is my fault.

35:03.312 --> 35:05.189
I dumped all this shite
at the end of her bed.

35:05.272 --> 35:07.482
Expected her to, what,

35:07.566 --> 35:10.068
just watch us two running around
like headless chickens?

35:10.569 --> 35:14.323
I don't think I can cope
if things go wrong in there.

35:14.406 --> 35:16.450
Things will not go wrong in there,
all right?

35:17.159 --> 35:20.204
And I've got the mess out here.
Okay? I have it.

35:21.413 --> 35:22.581
Thomas.

35:28.879 --> 35:31.507
Hey, I miss you. Where'd you go?

35:32.382 --> 35:34.343
Am I not worth investigating anymore?

36:24.726 --> 36:27.980
Hey. I don't know if you remember me.
I was in last week.

36:28.063 --> 36:29.857
You think I could forget that face?

36:30.858 --> 36:33.777
Yeah. I know.
Listen, I showed you a photo--

36:33.861 --> 36:35.195
You having a drink?

36:35.279 --> 36:37.531
No. I'm okay. I'm just…

36:40.325 --> 36:43.328
Yeah, I'll have a pint of…
what's that, lager?

36:43.954 --> 36:45.289
And whatever you're having.

36:47.666 --> 36:53.463
So, I asked if this lad was in
watching the match on the Friday.

36:54.298 --> 36:55.799
Yeah, I think so.

36:57.217 --> 36:59.761
Hang on. You said you were certain before.

36:59.845 --> 37:01.096
Did I?

37:01.180 --> 37:04.892
Yeah, no. Yeah, you definitely did
'cause I took notes.

37:05.934 --> 37:07.394
Probably. Look, I don't know.

37:09.146 --> 37:11.690
-I don't have a photograph memory.
-Okay.

37:12.816 --> 37:17.070
So, can I ask if you saw
any of these ladies on the Friday?

37:18.197 --> 37:21.950
Now, this one,
she was in on the Friday definitely.

37:22.034 --> 37:25.954
Drank double whiskeys.
Didn't buy any herself, might I add.

37:36.256 --> 37:37.466
Oh, come on.

37:37.549 --> 37:38.884
-Matt?
-Tom?

37:38.967 --> 37:40.469
-I can't talk, Matt.
-I have proof

37:40.552 --> 37:42.638
-that the sisters were lying.
-What?

37:42.721 --> 37:44.389
They weren't all together that night.

37:44.473 --> 37:47.559
The night Williams died?
I fucking knew it.

38:39.903 --> 38:43.574
The next couple of days
are just about Grace, all right?

38:43.657 --> 38:47.953
Nobody tries anything,
nobody goes it alone. Okay?

38:48.036 --> 38:51.164
No plans to. I need a drink.

39:06.180 --> 39:07.890
Makes me feel alive!

39:10.851 --> 39:12.102
I feel sick!

39:12.853 --> 39:14.021
Here we go!

39:15.272 --> 39:16.315
JP?

39:17.691 --> 39:19.860
Hold on tight, Mammy!

39:25.073 --> 39:27.326
Careful!

39:57.439 --> 39:58.440
I've got this.

40:11.453 --> 40:12.871
I know you were Oscar.

40:13.664 --> 40:15.624
And I know you got me in trouble
with the police.

40:15.707 --> 40:18.627
-Roger--
-No. I don't want to hear lies.

40:19.670 --> 40:21.630
I came here to ask you a question.

40:22.256 --> 40:23.257
Ask away.

40:24.842 --> 40:26.134
Why did you do it?

40:27.761 --> 40:29.054
You were my friend.

40:32.516 --> 40:35.936
Well, perhaps because I didn't like you
sniffing around my family,

40:36.019 --> 40:38.981
because we are not friends.

40:40.065 --> 40:41.817
And we never were.

40:41.900 --> 40:44.945
You're just a sad old man
from across the street

40:45.028 --> 40:47.239
that we tolerate
because we're nice people.

40:47.322 --> 40:51.869
And because you probably would fiddle
with kids if you could, wouldn't you?

40:53.662 --> 40:55.163
Do you know I prayed for you?

40:58.417 --> 40:59.418
And I forgive you.

41:04.173 --> 41:08.051
People like you, Roger,
don't get to forgive people like me.

41:09.428 --> 41:11.680
Forgiveness flows down.

41:12.764 --> 41:13.765
Remember that.

41:24.443 --> 41:25.694
Who was that, hon?

41:27.779 --> 41:31.742
Just some religious nut
lecturing me on forgiveness.

41:50.385 --> 41:51.512
Come on.

41:52.513 --> 41:53.597
Come on!

41:58.727 --> 42:01.313
Have any of you heard from Eva?
She's not answering me.

42:02.648 --> 42:05.067
I don't know where she is,
but she's got our room key.

42:07.152 --> 42:09.780
We need to get hammered. Like, medically.

42:11.406 --> 42:13.617
-Three double whiskeys?
-Actually, make it two.

42:13.700 --> 42:14.618
What? Why?

42:15.619 --> 42:17.329
Ben is staying nearby.

42:19.164 --> 42:20.791
It's my last night with him.

42:21.583 --> 42:22.626
Does he know that?

42:24.294 --> 42:25.295
Not yet.

42:26.255 --> 42:29.341
Anyway, I'll be back bright and early
to take us all to Grace's.

42:31.927 --> 42:34.930
Don't believe any of that
"last night together" crap.

42:35.472 --> 42:37.099
The horny bitch.

42:37.891 --> 42:38.892
Pub?

42:39.476 --> 42:41.770
No. I think I'm just gonna hit the sack.

42:41.854 --> 42:43.564
Would you text me when Eva gets back?

42:45.148 --> 42:46.525
You know Ursula got the pento?

42:47.234 --> 42:48.443
What?

42:50.362 --> 42:52.698
Eva wouldn't do anything
without telling us.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.743
What, you think she's gonna do it?

42:57.578 --> 42:59.079
I think she thinks she's gonna.

42:59.162 --> 43:00.247
What does that mean?

43:02.875 --> 43:03.876
Becka?

43:04.835 --> 43:05.836
Becka!

43:14.178 --> 43:17.181
I was just thinking how nice it is
when it's just the two of us.

43:21.935 --> 43:24.897
Do you really have to go
and see your sisters tomorrow?

43:24.980 --> 43:27.316
Oh, JP, it's too late to cancel now.

43:28.066 --> 43:29.776
And I'll be back by lunch.

43:31.361 --> 43:33.572
Your sisters never really liked me,
did they?

43:42.748 --> 43:44.708
But do you know how much it hurts

43:45.751 --> 43:47.836
when I feel that you love them
more than me?

43:49.171 --> 43:50.422
But that's not true.

43:54.760 --> 43:56.512
Good.

43:57.638 --> 43:59.264
To "just us."

44:00.057 --> 44:01.183
Just us.

44:21.703 --> 44:22.788
Becka?

44:55.153 --> 44:56.864
I wish he'd leave us alone.

44:58.824 --> 45:02.077
Without him,
we could go back to the way we were.

45:38.530 --> 45:39.531
Oi.

45:41.533 --> 45:42.910
Where did you go last night?

45:45.954 --> 45:46.955
Pub.

45:51.251 --> 45:52.503
Very muddy pub.

45:55.589 --> 45:56.590
Jesus.

45:58.967 --> 46:00.177
What is wrong with you?

46:07.851 --> 46:09.061
Just checking you're here.

46:09.978 --> 46:11.104
Where else would I be?

46:23.742 --> 46:24.952
Ben?

46:33.710 --> 46:35.212
Shit!

46:35.879 --> 46:37.047
No.

46:52.312 --> 46:53.730
Think I should call Urs?

46:54.314 --> 46:57.526
Why?
She's barely phoning it in these days.

47:03.240 --> 47:04.324
What's wrong?

47:04.408 --> 47:05.784
I don't wanna go in.

47:06.910 --> 47:09.705
Just call Grace and get her
to meet us at the end of the road.

47:09.788 --> 47:11.456
No, I will not.

47:11.540 --> 47:14.209
Just put your party hats on and be normal.

47:26.054 --> 47:29.224
Put your party hat on. Please.

47:29.725 --> 47:30.934
Please!

47:35.856 --> 47:37.274
And your party face.

47:41.570 --> 47:42.821
That's better.

47:42.905 --> 47:44.781
-Oh, shit.
-What the fuck?

47:45.741 --> 47:47.451
-Grace!
-Grace!

47:52.873 --> 47:53.790
What?

47:54.291 --> 47:55.292
What?

47:55.876 --> 47:58.587
John Paul is dead. He's dead, Eva.
