WEBVTT

00:26.985 --> 00:28.778
<i>This is who we're up against.</i>

00:28.862 --> 00:31.448
<i>Roger Salas, head of SLS,</i>

00:31.531 --> 00:34.242
<i>the largest financial security firm</i>
<i>on the East Coast.</i>

00:35.452 --> 00:37.203
<i>He believes he's untouchable.</i>

00:38.079 --> 00:39.622
<i>He is wrong.</i>

00:40.373 --> 00:43.418
<i>His family believes</i>
<i>he lived a good, clean life.</i>

00:44.085 --> 00:45.503
<i>His family is wrong.</i>

00:45.587 --> 00:48.339
<i>The world believes</i>
<i>he is a titan of industry</i>

00:48.423 --> 00:50.216
<i>and a man of virtue.</i>

00:50.300 --> 00:53.678
<i>The world has no idea who he really is.</i>

00:54.304 --> 00:56.765
It will take seven jobs to beat him.

00:57.348 --> 01:02.020
Seven jobs between us
and everything we ever wanted.

01:02.103 --> 01:03.521
We thread that needle,

01:04.564 --> 01:06.983
we're kings and queens.

01:07.567 --> 01:11.404
Job one. 505 Wall Street.

01:11.988 --> 01:16.785
<i>SLS encodes RF transmitters</i>
<i>into its armored trucks.</i>

01:17.410 --> 01:19.496
It's the only way down
into the loading dock.

01:19.579 --> 01:22.957
<i>We can clone it as long as we stay close.</i>

01:24.209 --> 01:27.337
<i>If we don't get the code</i>
<i>before the truck goes in…</i>

01:30.757 --> 01:33.593
…there is no job two.

01:54.656 --> 01:55.990
<i>If anyone clocks us…</i>

01:59.702 --> 02:01.496
Bang. We're dead.

02:01.579 --> 02:02.831
Move it along.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.458
<i>Roger wins. We lose.</i>

02:08.670 --> 02:09.879
Move it, now.

02:13.925 --> 02:17.512
<i>Job two. Getting into SLS.</i>

02:21.808 --> 02:24.727
<i>It starts with a series of doors</i>
<i>manned by armed guards</i>

02:25.436 --> 02:28.189
<i>and two elevators with restricted access.</i>

02:28.815 --> 02:30.358
<i>One for valuables…</i>

02:31.693 --> 02:33.820
<i>and one for clients.</i>

02:35.738 --> 02:41.119
All of it under video surveillance,
recorded and uploaded 24/7.

02:41.828 --> 02:46.624
<i>Job three. Two more armed guards</i>
<i>with military training in the lobby.</i>

02:47.959 --> 02:49.210
Welcome to SLS.

02:49.294 --> 02:52.130
You've met, uh, Hannah Kim,
the head of digital security.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.757
-I'm sorry, uh, Bob, am I bothering you?

02:57.302 --> 02:58.887
Uh, Chiefs are up by six.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.431
Oh, yeah. Chiefs are up by six?

03:02.640 --> 03:03.641
Yeah.

03:08.229 --> 03:11.232
Okay, people.
This is where it gets tricky.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.484
Oh, this is where it gets tricky.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.991
Here we are. The vault hallway.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.706
<i>Job four is the hallway door.</i>

03:26.789 --> 03:28.833
<i>We have a card for that,</i>
<i>so we should be good.</i>

03:28.917 --> 03:31.336
<i>Once it's open, job five.</i>

03:32.253 --> 03:34.380
We will have gear.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.799
We will have to move silently.

03:36.883 --> 03:40.178
And the biggest problem of all is
as soon as the door opens,

03:40.261 --> 03:45.350
<i>it activates a multi-matrix</i>
<i>biometric gait recognition unit.</i>

03:45.433 --> 03:49.520
-Which for the non-nerds means what?
-The system recognizes your walk.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.690
<i>Anybody who's not supposed to be here,</i>
<i>the cameras will pick it up.</i>

03:52.774 --> 03:55.777
And we can't black them out? Smoke it?

03:55.860 --> 03:57.153
Motion. Infrared.

03:57.737 --> 04:01.532
So you're saying we've got
to be invisible and if we can't, then--

04:01.616 --> 04:03.243
Gates come down, guards come in.

04:03.326 --> 04:07.080
Dead. Yeah, right. Uh…
I'm just really concerned about the hall--

04:07.163 --> 04:08.581
The hallway is job five.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.542
Next, job six.

04:12.961 --> 04:16.965
Opening the vault door
and turning off the temperature sensors.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.842
Roger uses a three-part security,
something you are…

04:21.970 --> 04:23.346
<i>Commence, Roger.</i>

04:23.429 --> 04:28.643
…something you have
and something you know.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.772
<i>The code turns off</i>
<i>the temperature monitors.</i>

04:34.691 --> 04:36.442
<i>So, how do we get the code?</i>

04:41.030 --> 04:42.031
We don't.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.993
Only Roger knows it,
and he changes it every day.

04:45.868 --> 04:49.580
The moment we come in,
the temperature will start to rise.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.458
And once it gets above 73 degrees--

04:52.542 --> 04:53.668
-We're fucked.
-Diabolical.

04:53.751 --> 04:54.919
Life in prison, got it.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.714
Yeah. We can get by everything else,
but not that.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.800
Unless, you've put in a backdoor.

05:01.801 --> 05:02.635
Hmm.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.013
Did you tell them you put in a backdoor?

05:07.473 --> 05:08.683
I put in a backdoor.

05:10.393 --> 05:13.730
<i>A software patch that allows us</i>
<i>to disable the temperature sensors.</i>

05:14.355 --> 05:17.233
<i>Without that, we'd never</i>
<i>have a shot at getting inside.</i>

05:25.033 --> 05:29.287
This is the most secure vault

05:30.038 --> 05:33.875
on the East Coast, in the United States.

05:35.835 --> 05:36.919
Maybe in the world.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.048
My own personal safe is right there.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.469
I wouldn't trust it anywhere else.

05:57.482 --> 06:02.487
From this moment on,
your assets are 100% secure.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.073
There is no one and nothing

06:05.740 --> 06:08.785
that can get inside this vault,
unless I want them to.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.046
And finally, job seven.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.509
We crack the safes, extract the bonds,

06:25.426 --> 06:29.806
haul them upstairs into the truck,
all in about an hour.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.266
And no one's the wiser.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.773
She basically robs herself.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.194
Can I please have my phone back?

06:48.199 --> 06:49.450
They fucking lost.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.138
Uh, Suzanne and Woo
will be in town tomorrow.

07:10.221 --> 07:13.141
I've got a cocktail party at the council.
You should join.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.684
I'll check my calendar.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.359
We did it.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.027
I did it.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.449
I'm dodging cars. I'm jumping curbs.
It's full on GTA.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.409
This guy pulls up to me,
he's all strapped.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.910
He's about to kill me and--

07:34.745 --> 07:36.080
Yeah.

07:40.501 --> 07:42.462
Um, why don't you go work on the truck?

07:42.545 --> 07:46.007
Mmm. Yeah, good-- Great idea. Good.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.468
Yeah.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.015
The kid just wanted a nice word.

07:54.098 --> 07:57.101
He can have all the nice words
once we're finished.

08:35.723 --> 08:37.058
Yeah. Good.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.728
RJ, you're gonna wanna
stack this shit so it's even.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.396
This seems like four feet high.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.649
-It's gonna fall and crush your feet.
-Cool.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.317
Why don't we carry them out?

08:46.901 --> 08:48.861
Every bond's worth 100K, right?

08:48.945 --> 08:51.322
So that's 70,000 pieces of paper.

08:51.405 --> 08:53.616
Assume each bond is five grams.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.911
That's 350,000 grams, which is 771 pounds.

08:56.994 --> 08:59.789
Factor in the weight of the cases,
you're talking nearly a ton.

08:59.872 --> 09:03.459
I didn't hear a word you said
'cause you're so sexy when you do maths.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.211
Oh, yeah? Just when I do maths?

09:05.294 --> 09:07.505
-When you do anything.
-There's more.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.675
-Will you give me some maths?
-What kind of maths do you want?

09:10.758 --> 09:14.011
No, it's… it's nice seeing a couple
show affection after so many years,

09:14.095 --> 09:16.389
I mean, my parents didn't really touch.

09:16.472 --> 09:19.725
I don't think it's shaped my views
on intimacy, but it's hard to know.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.269
Why is the mop still talking?

09:21.352 --> 09:23.187
-Leave him alone.
-Leave him alone?

09:23.271 --> 09:26.107
Are you gonna say that
when he gets us caught with his chirping?

09:26.190 --> 09:27.191
Little budgie?

09:29.318 --> 09:30.736
Least I got two good hands.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.447
You got two good hands, have you?

09:33.531 --> 09:35.074
Got two fucking good hands?

09:35.157 --> 09:37.910
-You got shit fucking feet though. Huh?
-Hey!

09:37.994 --> 09:39.328
What's going on out here?

09:39.412 --> 09:42.748
Sorry, Mr. Jenkins.
We won't play in the yard anymore!

09:42.832 --> 09:45.876
All good, Leo.
Yeah, got it covered, so… so no worries.

09:45.960 --> 09:50.006
Hey, guys. Play nice. I'll be back.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.634
Yeah, I understand,

09:54.343 --> 09:57.221
but I cannot give you
information I don't have.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.558
So there's nothing to report, okay?
I'll be in touch.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.476
You heading out to Roger's place?

10:02.560 --> 10:05.605
Yeah. Gotta jam the cameras,
set up the facial scan.

10:06.439 --> 10:10.735
Maybe you should send Judy.
And you stay here.

10:11.527 --> 10:14.196
No, that's not something
I'm trusting to anybody else.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.661
It's gotten personal.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.164
Ever been anything else?

10:40.723 --> 10:43.643
They're your fucking problem now.
Fucking bees.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.652
<i>The queen bee</i>
<i>is the female leader of the colony.</i>

10:53.444 --> 10:56.155
<i>She communicates her directives</i>
<i>with pheromones</i>

10:56.238 --> 10:59.075
<i>and where she goes, the other bees follow.</i>

10:59.742 --> 11:01.994
<i>Worker bees are all female…</i>

11:02.078 --> 11:02.912
God damn it.

11:03.788 --> 11:07.124
I don't know why I bother to order lengua.
They always fuck it up.

11:13.089 --> 11:17.635
So, I was thinking, maybe I should
be strapped for the heist, like you guys.

11:17.718 --> 11:18.552
You…

11:20.179 --> 11:23.516
You, um…
You don't need a gun for this, hon.

11:24.392 --> 11:28.771
Yeah. No, you're right.
But, what if, like, shit goes down?

11:28.854 --> 11:31.941
What kind of shit is gonna go down
in your world, exactly?

11:32.024 --> 11:34.443
I don't know, like, a guard comes out,

11:34.527 --> 11:37.029
and he's like…
"Oi, what are you doing?"

11:37.113 --> 11:38.614
Why are the guards British?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.908
I don't know,
it could be any--

11:40.991 --> 11:43.953
No, you gotta drive us there,
load the van, drive us home.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.162
There's… there's no gun.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.289
Okay, yeah, we'll put a pin in it

11:47.373 --> 11:49.542
and circle back on the gun stuff,
but yeah.

11:49.625 --> 11:50.459
-Oh.
-Mmm-hmm?

11:55.756 --> 11:56.590
Mmm-hmm.

12:08.477 --> 12:09.729
Do you know these people?

12:10.813 --> 12:11.897
We will soon enough.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.526
I hope I can help make a good impression.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.529
You couldn't make a bad one if you tried.

13:14.251 --> 13:15.753
Here's your happy ending.

13:15.836 --> 13:20.132
We pull this off,
I'm buyin' me a vineyard in Portugal.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.511
Grow some grapes.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.598
Sell some wine down at the restaurant
and drink the rest.

13:33.562 --> 13:34.980
Just me and someone special.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.191
-So your mother then?

13:37.274 --> 13:38.984
At least I got dreams, asshole.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.447
This asshole's got dreams,
don't worry about that.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.200
I'm going to post up
in the Bahamas.

13:46.283 --> 13:49.078
Fucking pink sands
as far as the eye can see.

13:49.161 --> 13:54.875
We pull this off, I got my eye
on Butch Vig's original 1965 Ludwig.

13:59.046 --> 13:59.880
It's a drum set.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.341
-You could buy a million drum sets.
-A drum set.

14:02.424 --> 14:03.634
I'll get you ten myself.

14:03.717 --> 14:06.679
Thanks, but this one Butch played on
when he was with Garbage.

14:07.346 --> 14:11.767
It's in the Wisconsin Historical Museum,
but, you know, money talks.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.227
Idiot.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.939
He can dream however he wants, you know?

14:17.523 --> 14:18.983
What are you gonna do, Judy?

14:21.110 --> 14:25.614
There's this small
mountain town in Mexico,

14:26.198 --> 14:27.533
Angangueo. Um…

14:28.492 --> 14:30.494
My dad took me there when I was a kid.

14:30.995 --> 14:35.249
It's where, um, monarch butterflies
go in winter.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.208
They, uh…

14:37.751 --> 14:40.838
They spend the whole year
traveling, like, thousands of miles,

14:40.921 --> 14:42.840
but they only live, like, three weeks,

14:42.923 --> 14:44.258
just enough to lay an egg.

14:44.341 --> 14:48.888
And then, the last ones hit Angangueo

14:49.513 --> 14:52.391
and they live, like, eight, nine months.

14:52.474 --> 14:56.937
Like, they know they're
the end of the line, you know, they're…

14:58.314 --> 15:00.774
carrying the torch as far as it will go.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.699
So, um…
So, yeah, that's… that's where I'd go.

15:10.993 --> 15:11.869
Beautiful.

15:15.372 --> 15:18.834
Sounds like you'll be
lying on those pink sands all alone, Bob.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.884
You have something to say, cunt? Huh?

15:26.967 --> 15:29.094
Huh? Something to say, spit it!

15:29.178 --> 15:30.512
You little piss-head cunt,

15:30.596 --> 15:32.473
I'll dig a hole for you, you pussy cunt!

15:32.556 --> 15:33.474
-Hey--
-Fuck off!

15:35.184 --> 15:37.645
-What the fuck?
-No, Judy, come on, I…

15:41.148 --> 15:41.982
Hey, hey. Hey.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.526
Every fucking time with this guy,
every time!

15:44.610 --> 15:46.779
-I know. Bob, don't.
-Every time with this guy.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.614
-He doesn't matter.
-I'm fucking trying.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.532
-Hey, breathe. Breathe.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.034
-I'm trying, I'm trying.
-I…

15:52.576 --> 15:53.994
-I'm trying. I'm sorry.
-…love you.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.080
-I love you.
-I'm sorry. You know that.

15:57.081 --> 15:57.915
I'm sorry.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.125
Don't scare me like that.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.878
I don't like it
when you scare me like that.

16:06.006 --> 16:08.008
-Listen to me. Listen.
-Mmm-hmm.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.219
The second we get
our hands on those bonds…

16:10.302 --> 16:11.220
Mmm?

16:11.720 --> 16:12.930
…we fucking take it all.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.975
-Yeah?
-Okay.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.518
We're gonna set ourselves up.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.063
Just you and me, baby. Yeah?

16:22.481 --> 16:23.399
Just you and me.

16:23.899 --> 16:25.818
-Yeah, of course it is.
-Forever.

16:26.860 --> 16:29.863
Yeah, of course. I love you.

16:29.947 --> 16:30.990
I love you.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.494
Oh, yeah.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.389
It seems a little dangerous.

16:55.472 --> 16:58.642
No, surprisingly simple
and already worked out.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.811
With very little risk on your end.

17:00.894 --> 17:01.937
Hmm.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.439
Ah.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.606
I'm glad you made it.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.067
As am I. Stefan, my wife Sakura.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.279
I was telling Mr. Thiele here
about our asset protection plans.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.240
Hmm. Here I am
thinking this is a night of relaxation.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.119
-A word?
-Of course.

19:08.897 --> 19:12.442
Look at this.
All three of you in the same place.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.031
Listen, while I have you…

19:19.783 --> 19:21.034
I wanted to mention,

19:21.118 --> 19:24.121
I've been, um, exploring some options
for European expansion.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.706
We want you to move our bonds.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.792
I just moved them into the vault.

19:29.376 --> 19:33.297
What he means to say
is that we would like you to assist us

19:33.380 --> 19:37.009
in exchanging them
for a different type of asset.

19:37.092 --> 19:39.094
Yes, a cleaner type.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.348
Their origin is, uh…
problematic.

19:44.474 --> 19:47.644
Discretion and speed
would be greatly appreciated.

19:50.272 --> 19:53.108
Well, I'm not really set up
for that sort of thing.

19:53.859 --> 19:58.530
Unfortunately, we've got
a bit of a spotlight on us at the moment.

19:58.614 --> 20:02.910
Government's looking far too hard
at every, uh, transaction we make.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.329
But a man such as yourself…

20:05.412 --> 20:10.667
Respected, connected,
at an arm's length distance, you see?

20:12.920 --> 20:17.299
Well, I can't just, uh,
make $7 billion disappear overnight.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.467
I mean, I'm sure you…

20:19.176 --> 20:23.555
I'm sure you appreciate
how difficult it is to…

20:24.723 --> 20:28.101
tidy up that amount
without setting off alarm bells.

20:29.019 --> 20:32.147
Well, you are a resourceful man.

20:34.483 --> 20:39.196
I expect you will find a way
to, uh, be helpful.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.840
-Who is this?
-<i>Check your email.</i>

21:49.516 --> 21:50.392
What do you want?

21:50.475 --> 21:53.603
<i>I want you to know</i>
<i>that nothing you have is safe.</i>

21:53.687 --> 21:57.232
<i>Your family, your identity,</i>
<i>your precious vault.</i>

21:58.358 --> 21:59.735
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

22:06.116 --> 22:07.701
I want a run-through on every system.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.953
Not just SLS, but all 505 Wall.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.997
Also, can you trace an encrypted email?

22:12.080 --> 22:14.374
Uh, depends on how many proxies.
Everything okay?

22:14.458 --> 22:16.585
Just trying to protect
our clients' assets.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.837
The Triplets are not people
you wanna upset.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.422
They seemed pretty nice to me.

22:20.964 --> 22:23.717
Some of these kinds of people,
you cross them the wrong way,

22:23.800 --> 22:26.094
you're walking down the street,
someone brushes you,

22:26.178 --> 22:28.472
three blocks later
you drop dead of a heart attack.

22:28.555 --> 22:29.806
-Keep your distance.
-Okay.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.308
Go run the security checks.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.728
Liz. Liz.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.105
Liz. Hey.

22:39.399 --> 22:40.359
Hold my calls, please.

22:40.442 --> 22:43.695
This is from management.
They're giving them to everyone, so… Ugh.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.366
My darling sister, dance with me.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.290
Because I am going above and beyond.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.959
I got my own little corner,
got my paper stacked up.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.087
When I go to the warehouses up town,

23:00.170 --> 23:03.090
grab more boxes,
add it to the pile, you see?

23:03.173 --> 23:05.217
Look who's been a busy little bee.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.511
You gotta make time
to make bank, am I right?

23:07.594 --> 23:10.013
-My Fitbit's ready to commit suicide.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.516
Just so you get it done right.

23:12.599 --> 23:15.644
Mmm. Worried your sister's
gonna leave you in the dust?

23:15.727 --> 23:18.897
I'm worried my kid sister
is going to forget why she's here.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.774
-Don't… Come on.
-I love you.

23:22.109 --> 23:25.570
Are you coming?
Only 137 more offices to go.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.364
I will see you at home.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.157
Cool, cool, cool.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.386
-<i>Mr. Salas.</i>

23:49.469 --> 23:52.264
<i>There's a Mr. Graham Davies</i>
<i>on the main line?</i>

23:53.223 --> 23:54.349
<i>Says it's urgent.</i>

23:55.308 --> 23:56.184
Put him through.

24:01.690 --> 24:02.524
Who is this?

24:03.024 --> 24:04.693
<i>4.3 million.</i>

24:06.027 --> 24:09.197
What? No.
That's ridiculous. I can't--

24:09.281 --> 24:11.032
<i>You thought this would be painless.</i>

24:11.116 --> 24:12.534
<i>You don't know real pain.</i>

24:13.201 --> 24:15.203
<i>There's an account number in your email.</i>

24:15.287 --> 24:16.121
Look.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.708
<i>-You have three days.</i>

24:19.791 --> 24:20.625
Hello?

24:26.673 --> 24:27.549
Yeah?

24:28.967 --> 24:30.552
Hey. Um…

24:31.386 --> 24:33.180
I think I may have found something.

24:33.263 --> 24:34.890
I was running system analysis

24:34.973 --> 24:39.311
and it looks like if the system
is accessed in a very specific order,

24:39.394 --> 24:42.522
it could cause a fault
in the vault's temperature sensors.

24:42.606 --> 24:43.857
Mmm-hmm.

24:43.940 --> 24:46.568
It's almost like a backdoor.

24:48.778 --> 24:50.780
You saying
someone did this deliberately?

24:50.864 --> 24:52.741
It looks more like a glitch to me.

24:54.409 --> 24:55.577
It… it looks like it?

24:55.660 --> 24:57.829
Which is it?
A glitch or a fucking backdoor?

24:58.622 --> 24:59.456
Uh…

24:59.539 --> 25:03.793
This system was installed seven years ago
when we first built the vault.

25:04.920 --> 25:09.508
So unless you believe
someone has been biding their time,

25:09.591 --> 25:13.094
waiting years
to spring some elaborate trap,

25:14.471 --> 25:16.765
then bad firmware is just bad firmware.

25:22.062 --> 25:22.896
Fix it.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.314
We're on it.

25:24.397 --> 25:27.943
And, hey…
Can I please call you an eye doctor?

25:29.319 --> 25:30.153
Sure.

25:31.238 --> 25:34.282
I do have an account number,
so we'll track the bastard down.

25:35.116 --> 25:36.326
I'll ask Hannah to trace it.

25:36.409 --> 25:37.577
No, no. Just…

25:38.245 --> 25:39.955
I don't want anyone else involved.

25:40.747 --> 25:44.251
This guy, he, uh… he knows who I am.

25:44.334 --> 25:45.752
Everybody knows who you are.

25:45.835 --> 25:46.670
No.

25:50.006 --> 25:51.091
He knows who I am.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.469
Just get me a name.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.852
Try to keep
your eyes wide open, please.

26:10.569 --> 26:11.611
Where's Dr. Lowe?

26:13.488 --> 26:16.074
Dr. Lowe had an emergency.

26:16.157 --> 26:18.577
Which I believe
was the back nine at Forest Park.

26:19.327 --> 26:21.288
-Lucky bastard.
-Hmm.

26:25.834 --> 26:26.918
Eyes ahead, please.

26:32.382 --> 26:33.925
Good.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.429
Turn the lights on, please.

26:42.142 --> 26:42.976
Yeah.

26:44.144 --> 26:47.731
Yeah. Looks like
a simple bacterial infection.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.151
Two drops in each eye, every two hours.

26:51.901 --> 26:54.654
Should be feeling fine by morning.
If not, just give me a call.

26:55.322 --> 26:56.156
Thank you.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.080
The backdoor's closed.

27:05.707 --> 27:06.833
What are you talking about?

27:06.916 --> 27:11.880
I was running some checks at the office.
The bypass is gone.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.465
No, it can't be.

27:13.548 --> 27:16.551
I had it placed years ago,
I paid the manufacturer 50 large.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.637
I don't know what to tell you.

27:20.430 --> 27:21.598
It's gone.

27:28.688 --> 27:31.316
Salas must have found it and closed it up.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.236
Maybe something spooked him.

27:35.945 --> 27:37.155
What, you looking at me?

27:37.822 --> 27:40.200
I got in and out of his place
clean and proper.

27:43.244 --> 27:45.121
There's no way we could pull this off.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.290
We're gonna have to shut it down.

27:58.718 --> 28:00.220
Maybe it's not that bad.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.183
He had pictures of his family.

28:06.476 --> 28:07.852
In his house.

28:09.437 --> 28:11.815
His wife, his son.

28:12.816 --> 28:16.528
They're… happy.

28:18.571 --> 28:21.616
They don't know who he was or what he did.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.912
I wonder if he even remembers anymore.

28:27.455 --> 28:30.542
He has everything, Ava.

28:30.625 --> 28:34.713
And all I have
is a way to make things even.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.548
And now?

28:40.468 --> 28:41.678
He wins.

28:43.638 --> 28:46.975
So, I'm pretty sure
it's a bad fucking thing.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.639
Welcome to Setec Data Recovery.
You have an appointment?

29:27.223 --> 29:29.184
No, I don't think you're expecting me.

29:33.813 --> 29:34.939
Hey, uh, Greg.

29:35.023 --> 29:38.485
Can you, um,
check on that shipment from Tully?

29:40.403 --> 29:42.989
You are good. I'll give you that.

29:44.699 --> 29:45.909
That's why I hired you.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.786
I'm a hell of a judge of talent.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.413
But you overplayed your hand.

29:52.415 --> 29:54.292
4.3 million?

29:55.126 --> 29:57.378
It's almost my exact net worth.

29:57.462 --> 30:00.298
If you don't count the fact
that I'm leveraged up to the hilt.

30:00.381 --> 30:03.635
That meant former employee,
someone with a grudge,

30:03.718 --> 30:05.845
someone who could
hack into my personal info,

30:05.929 --> 30:07.764
track me all the way back to Jersey.

30:07.847 --> 30:10.934
Put them all together,
that spells you, Andrew.

30:13.770 --> 30:20.401
Did you really think that
blackmailing me was your best option?

30:20.485 --> 30:22.487
You didn't think
I was going to figure it out?

30:22.570 --> 30:25.824
What was I supposed to do?
See where I'm working?

30:27.200 --> 30:30.119
I had no choice.
You ruined my name all over town.

30:30.203 --> 30:32.372
You're a thief.
That's what happens to thieves.

30:32.455 --> 30:34.207
Christine. Remember her?

30:35.083 --> 30:36.000
Yeah, she left me.

30:36.876 --> 30:38.461
She-- She took our son.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.881
You should've thought of that
before you stole from me.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.133
I didn't steal anything!

30:44.217 --> 30:47.512
I'm happy that we're getting
this chance to talk, just me and you.

30:47.595 --> 30:51.266
No calls or emails, no fucking texts.
Just man to man.

30:51.349 --> 30:56.646
What I'm here to tell you is that from me,
the only thing you get is a warning.

30:57.981 --> 31:01.943
Just this one chance. I hope you take it.

31:05.530 --> 31:06.781
I gave you a number.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.369
And a deadline and a consequence.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.748
How do you think
The Triplets are gonna feel

31:15.832 --> 31:17.750
when they find out who you really are?

31:21.296 --> 31:23.089
Oh, Andrew.

31:23.172 --> 31:25.300
They hired you because you're clean.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.136
A port in a storm.

31:28.219 --> 31:34.434
But if they get a call,
or a text, or an email…

31:35.768 --> 31:39.272
Or if the SEC gets a call. Or the FBI.

31:40.732 --> 31:41.608
Andrew.

31:42.984 --> 31:46.279
$4.3 million. Three days.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.284
-Hey.
-I'll be with you in one second.

31:51.367 --> 31:52.201
Yep.

31:52.994 --> 31:53.995
Hey.

31:57.957 --> 32:02.295
If it doesn't work out,
we're always hiring.

32:36.829 --> 32:37.664
See ya.

34:11.466 --> 34:12.300
Hey.

34:13.092 --> 34:13.926
Hi.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.555
See the storm?

34:17.638 --> 34:19.182
Yeah. Shit.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.895
They start out in Africa, you know that?

34:26.981 --> 34:29.859
Fucking dust storms in the Sahara.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.905
Turn into these monsters.

34:35.156 --> 34:39.285
Once in a while,
one just gets bigger, you know.

34:39.952 --> 34:43.456
Pick up enough wind, heat, and rain.

34:44.082 --> 34:46.584
Drag thousands of miles
across the open ocean.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.379
When you see it on the news and it…

34:52.340 --> 34:54.634
kind of looks like inevitable.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.055
No matter where you picked it up
or how long you've been tracking,

34:59.138 --> 35:00.556
it's always going to happen.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.435
You don't know which ones are gonna die

35:04.519 --> 35:09.107
and which ones are going to grow up
to be fucking giant monsters,

35:09.190 --> 35:11.067
you know, staring you down.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.278
There's nothing you can do, you just…

35:15.822 --> 35:17.532
go out in the wind and the rain.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.159
Just face the storm.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.663
Pray that when the whole thing blows over,

35:23.746 --> 35:25.790
you're still fucking standing, you know?

35:28.417 --> 35:29.252
Right?

35:37.135 --> 35:38.594
We're going to use the hurricane.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.680
No one knows what you're talking about.

35:40.763 --> 35:43.599
The backdoor was designed
to get past the temperature sensors.

35:43.683 --> 35:45.518
No backdoor, no way past it.

35:47.228 --> 35:48.855
Until now. Show 'em.

35:49.647 --> 35:51.816
Okay, this is a penny.
This is cesium azide.

35:51.899 --> 35:53.609
You're going to want to step back.

35:55.069 --> 35:55.945
Back.

35:57.446 --> 35:58.531
More.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.951
Guys, I'm wearing
goggles and gloves, yeah?

36:02.034 --> 36:05.621
Just fucking fuck off.
Three steps. More. Good.

36:15.798 --> 36:17.341
-Wow!

36:21.596 --> 36:23.764
-Holy moly.
-Yep.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.683
How the fuck does that help us?

36:25.766 --> 36:28.019
Imagine much bigger pennies.

36:28.102 --> 36:29.687
So, it's like a gun?

36:29.770 --> 36:32.690
Yeah,
like seven guns all firing at once.

36:35.401 --> 36:38.446
Pure cesium oxidizes like a motherfucker.

36:38.529 --> 36:41.407
It's way too unstable,
so I developed a derivative.

36:42.158 --> 36:43.659
It doesn't oxidize as easily,

36:43.743 --> 36:46.871
but still with a low ionization energy,
the sublimation point…

36:49.248 --> 36:50.750
No one gives a fuck. Um…

36:52.001 --> 36:53.753
We need a shit ton of water.

36:53.836 --> 36:55.922
-Where do you get this shit?
-Etsy.

36:56.005 --> 36:58.925
New York City has given us a gift.

36:59.008 --> 37:00.551
Water tunnel number one.

37:01.052 --> 37:05.473
Built in 1917. Ten feet in diameter.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.516
Empty for decades.

37:07.600 --> 37:12.480
It runs right underneath
the Wall Street subway station.

37:12.563 --> 37:14.815
You get three or four inches
of rain in there,

37:14.899 --> 37:16.817
that station turns into Niagara Falls.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.362
And during a hurricane with storm surge?

37:19.862 --> 37:21.072
It would flood.

37:21.155 --> 37:24.825
That same tunnel
runs just above the vault.

37:26.118 --> 37:28.746
So we wait for the subway to flood

37:28.829 --> 37:33.292
and then we blow the bottom with C4

37:33.376 --> 37:38.089
and we direct the water
into the tunnel above the vault.

37:38.172 --> 37:41.092
Right where it hits the right amount
of cesium in the right places,

37:41.175 --> 37:43.970
exploding and sending the metal slugs
through the vault roof,

37:44.053 --> 37:47.014
which smashes apart
their little temperature sensors.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.100
Backdoor back open.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.561
That is… It's intricate.

37:52.645 --> 37:53.521
Mmm-hmm.

37:54.021 --> 37:55.147
And if you're wrong?

37:56.565 --> 38:00.861
Well, either it won't do much of anything
or it'll explode and kill us all.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.739
But I just stay outside
with the truck, right?

38:03.823 --> 38:06.409
-Yeah.
-We meet back here after it's done.

38:06.492 --> 38:09.954
If it goes south,
the cabin at Tupper Lake. Three days.

38:11.914 --> 38:15.209
This is a bust out move.
Nothing clean about it. No going home.

38:16.210 --> 38:18.629
Ava will get new IDs
to hand out at the meetup

38:18.713 --> 38:22.800
and that is who you will become forever.

38:22.883 --> 38:28.014
We are taking money from
some of the most powerful people on earth.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.726
This is the only way we get to enjoy it.

38:31.809 --> 38:34.353
It's crazy, right? This feels crazy.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.814
Maybe. Vineyard worth finding out?

38:43.279 --> 38:44.780
My hand's not ready.

38:44.864 --> 38:47.533
Can you guide Stan on the second dial?

38:57.001 --> 38:59.712
This is going to take a lot of work.

38:59.795 --> 39:00.880
We move now.

39:01.797 --> 39:05.551
Or… we forget about it forever.

39:07.386 --> 39:12.016
We could just go back to…
whatever we had before.

39:17.480 --> 39:21.984
<i>Let me stress</i>
<i>that we are ordering these evacuations</i>

39:22.068 --> 39:26.655
<i>for the safety</i>
<i>of all of the New York City residents</i>

39:26.739 --> 39:28.741
<i>who live in these areas.</i>

41:00.374 --> 41:03.377
Brad, Mom says
you want to take next semester off.

41:04.378 --> 41:07.465
I don't need to go to class.
Not learning anything anyway.

41:09.508 --> 41:11.469
You two should just get comfortable.

41:13.637 --> 41:16.056
<i>We're beginning</i>
<i>to see winds picking up…</i>

41:16.140 --> 41:18.642
Toby. It's happening. Tonight.

41:18.726 --> 41:19.977
In the middle of a hurricane?

41:20.060 --> 41:21.479
Got a text from our favorite mole.

41:21.562 --> 41:23.689
It's happening at 505 Wall Street.
Come on.

41:24.398 --> 41:27.067
Hey, that's a massive building.
Nothing more specific?

41:27.151 --> 41:28.694
That's all I was given.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.529
Okay, well, let's work a quick list

41:30.613 --> 41:33.032
of every possible target
and lockdown a stakeout.

41:34.200 --> 41:37.036
If you want to catch the bastards,
this is going to be our shot.

41:38.579 --> 41:39.580
Let's go!

41:52.843 --> 41:54.512
<i>They are ready to respond.</i>

41:54.595 --> 41:59.141
<i>If this storm hits in full strength,</i>
<i>it may take days to repair all the damage.</i>

42:09.068 --> 42:11.153
Mr. Thiele, what can I do for you?

42:11.237 --> 42:13.864
<i>Have you given some thought</i>
<i>to what we discussed?</i>

42:13.948 --> 42:18.786
Uh, yes, I've… I've given it some thought
and I think there's something--

42:18.869 --> 42:21.497
<i>Frankly, I assumed</i>
<i>that a man of your background</i>

42:22.248 --> 42:24.416
<i>would have had less of an issue with this.</i>

42:26.794 --> 42:29.004
Of my background?

42:29.088 --> 42:32.758
<i>Before Roger Salas became Roger Salas.</i>

42:33.259 --> 42:35.302
<i>Did you think</i>
<i>we'd get into business with someone</i>

42:35.386 --> 42:37.263
<i>without knowing everything about them?</i>

42:37.346 --> 42:38.973
I don't know what you've heard,

42:40.766 --> 42:45.145
but that life, that is way behind me.

42:45.229 --> 42:47.106
<i>I appreciate a man with secrets.</i>

42:48.315 --> 42:49.858
<i>Especially when I know them.</i>

42:49.942 --> 42:51.819
<i>That shows me he can keep mine.</i>

42:52.987 --> 42:54.655
<i>Let's speak after the storm.</i>

42:55.406 --> 42:57.533
<i>Maybe you'll have better news for me then.</i>

43:35.571 --> 43:36.405
Hey.

43:37.781 --> 43:40.159
You should have one. Just in case.

43:41.201 --> 43:43.495
Yeah, yeah, cool, thanks.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.040
Okay, yeah, no, it's not a toy.

43:46.582 --> 43:48.208
-Yeah, yeah.

43:50.044 --> 43:51.211
What…

43:53.631 --> 43:55.090
Take care of yourself, okay?

43:56.634 --> 43:58.218
Yeah, yeah, you… you too.

44:22.034 --> 44:23.535
What are we doing, Leo?

44:24.328 --> 44:25.954
Hey, what's the story, big man?

44:31.919 --> 44:32.836
Let's go.
