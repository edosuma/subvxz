WEBVTT

00:00.925 --> 00:02.958
<i>Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.959 --> 00:04.260
Here we come, baby.
Whoo!

00:04.261 --> 00:06.462
20 chefs from
all across America...

00:06.463 --> 00:08.029
Whoo!

00:08.031 --> 00:10.066
Arrived in L.A.
anxious to begin the competition.

00:10.067 --> 00:11.500
Are we there yet?

00:11.501 --> 00:13.102
And were greeted
with their first surprise.

00:13.103 --> 00:17.640
I want you to come to me
in Las Vegas.

00:17.641 --> 00:19.508
We're going to Vegas!

00:19.509 --> 00:22.611
After a special V.I.P. tour,

00:22.612 --> 00:24.346
they got
an even bigger surprise.

00:26.016 --> 00:29.518
For the first time ever,
the signature dish challenge

00:29.519 --> 00:32.421
will happen in front
of a live audience.

00:32.421 --> 00:33.723
What?

00:33.724 --> 00:34.924
Whoo!

00:34.925 --> 00:36.225
Let's go!

00:36.226 --> 00:37.393
Right behind you.
Coming down.

00:37.394 --> 00:38.461
Gonna win this damn thing.

00:38.462 --> 00:40.663
<i>Two, one, and stop.</i>

00:40.664 --> 00:42.565
During judging...
Wow, wow, wow.

00:42.566 --> 00:44.700
Ja'nel...
Thank you, chef. Yes!

00:44.701 --> 00:46.035
Jon...
You've managed to nail it.

00:46.036 --> 00:47.403
Very good.

00:47.404 --> 00:48.437
And Cyndi...
That's delicious.

00:48.438 --> 00:49.705
Impressed chef Ramsay.

00:49.706 --> 00:51.140
Thank you, chef.

00:51.141 --> 00:53.209
While Sebastian...
That is disgusting.

00:53.210 --> 00:54.443
Danielle...

00:54.444 --> 00:55.811
What happened in that kitchen

00:55.812 --> 00:56.912
should have stayed
in that kitchen.

00:56.913 --> 00:57.913
Gina...

00:57.914 --> 00:59.448
Did you pick this up
at the buffet?

00:59.449 --> 01:01.016
And Dan...

01:01.017 --> 01:02.351
Did you throw up on that plate?

01:02.352 --> 01:04.986
Made a different
kind of impression.

01:04.988 --> 01:06.956
Zach and Jacqueline,
let's go, guys.

01:06.957 --> 01:10.092
It all came down
to the final two dishes.

01:10.093 --> 01:11.260
This is really close.

01:11.261 --> 01:13.996
Congratulations, ladies.
Great job. Yes!

01:13.997 --> 01:15.664
We the winner!
We the winner!

01:15.665 --> 01:19.034
We were the winner tonight.
Whoo!

01:19.035 --> 01:20.536
The victorious women...

01:20.537 --> 01:22.204
To the best!

01:22.205 --> 01:24.974
Received the royal
treatment at Caesar's Palace.

01:24.975 --> 01:27.376
I cannot believe
we met Celine Dion.

01:27.377 --> 01:30.212
While the men slummed it
back to Los Angeles...

01:30.213 --> 01:31.614
Hot in here, man.

01:31.615 --> 01:32.948
On an uncomfortable...

01:32.949 --> 01:34.116
I think one of the reasons that

01:34.117 --> 01:35.818
they really beat
the out of us today...

01:35.819 --> 01:37.086
And monotonous...

01:37.087 --> 01:38.788
I want to throw Sebastian
right out the window.

01:38.789 --> 01:40.156
He just talks too much.

01:40.157 --> 01:41.924
8 1/2-hour ride
on a school bus.

01:41.925 --> 01:43.526
We really got to focus
on trying to...

01:43.527 --> 01:46.929
Oh, my God.
Sebastian, time out.

01:46.930 --> 01:48.464
After returning from Vegas,

01:48.465 --> 01:51.567
<i>the women settled into
their Hell's Kitchen dorms...</i>

01:51.568 --> 01:53.202
So cool!
This is...

01:53.203 --> 01:56.539
And discovered there
is another chef on their team.

01:56.540 --> 01:58.007
What's the matter with you?

01:58.008 --> 01:59.141
We got to study.

01:59.142 --> 02:00.910
It's a nice-a place.

02:00.911 --> 02:04.847
Bitch, who brings a puppet
in Hell's Kitchen?

02:04.848 --> 02:05.848
On the first
day in the kitchen...

02:05.849 --> 02:06.882
Let's start working.

02:06.883 --> 02:08.184
The men are determined

02:08.185 --> 02:09.952
to bounce back from defeat.
Behind, behind behind.

02:09.953 --> 02:11.587
Dinner service coming up,
we got to come out swinging

02:11.588 --> 02:13.956
'cause we're not taking another
one to the chin like that.

02:13.957 --> 02:16.158
But on the
women's side, Gina is struck

02:16.159 --> 02:17.927
with a mysterious illness.

02:17.928 --> 02:19.261
I can't function.

02:19.262 --> 02:20.996
<i>Are we operating without Gina?
Medic!</i>

02:20.997 --> 02:24.099
Find out right now if
she's out of the competition...

02:24.100 --> 02:25.701
Do you need to go
to the emergency room?

02:25.702 --> 02:28.037

continuation of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

03:39.109 --> 03:41.777
The doors have not yet opened
for dinner service.

03:41.778 --> 03:44.213
Gina, what's going on?

03:44.214 --> 03:46.348
Um, I can't function.

03:46.349 --> 03:48.784
And Gina is already
feeling the pressure.

03:48.785 --> 03:50.286
I'm sorry that
I'm doing this, but...

03:50.287 --> 03:54.023
No, let's go.
Let's go back here.

03:54.024 --> 03:58.027
Sit down right here.
Medic! Medic!

03:58.028 --> 03:59.628
Can you tell me your name?

03:59.629 --> 04:01.630
Do you know
where you are right now?

04:01.631 --> 04:03.766
I was, like, standing in line,

04:03.767 --> 04:05.768
and I was getting overwhelmed.

04:05.769 --> 04:08.837
Okay. Are you feeling okay
right now?

04:08.838 --> 04:10.239
Yeah.

04:10.240 --> 04:14.610
Like, my mind's wandering
about all stuff right now.

04:14.611 --> 04:17.613
I need just to relax my system.

04:19.683 --> 04:21.684
You're not dizzy or anything?

04:21.685 --> 04:24.687
No, I just don't
want to be in a kitchen.

04:27.724 --> 04:28.824
Let's go, ladies.

04:28.825 --> 04:31.293
While the red team shucks,

04:31.294 --> 04:33.862
scrapes, and slices
in preparation

04:33.863 --> 04:35.631
for the impending
dinner service...

04:35.632 --> 04:38.901
Now we a man down.
What are we gonna do?

04:38.902 --> 04:40.903
We gonna pull it together.

04:40.904 --> 04:46.842
Up in the dorms,
Gina focuses on Gina.

04:46.843 --> 04:50.546
I need to be away
from everything,

04:50.547 --> 04:54.583
away from all my teammates,
and concentrate

04:54.584 --> 04:57.319
just on myself
and get myself together.

04:57.320 --> 05:00.255
While the red team
has lost a chef,

05:00.256 --> 05:01.457
in the blue kitchen...

05:01.458 --> 05:02.791
Did anybody see how he

05:02.792 --> 05:04.960
pre-heated up
the potato puree?

05:04.961 --> 05:06.795
One chef is just lost.

05:06.796 --> 05:07.896
He's got the potato right here.

05:07.897 --> 05:09.231
He's got the leeks right here.

05:09.232 --> 05:10.566
<i>It's ready to go.
This is bass, so put bass.</i>

05:10.567 --> 05:13.502
Working side-by-side
with Jeremy, I'm gonna tell ya,

05:13.503 --> 05:15.504
I think his inexperience
shines through.

05:17.107 --> 05:18.892
I'm just a little
concerned right now.

05:20.543 --> 05:22.244
While Jeremy
struggles to keep up

05:22.245 --> 05:24.646
in the blue kitchen,
in the red kitchen...

05:24.647 --> 05:26.815
How we feeling?
Good!

05:26.816 --> 05:29.084
The women are
moving full speed ahead,

05:29.085 --> 05:30.419
despite being down a chef.

05:30.420 --> 05:32.621
Are we gonna win tonight?
Yeah!

05:32.622 --> 05:35.090
I definitely think
that without Gina here,

05:35.091 --> 05:36.258
we are a stronger team.

05:36.259 --> 05:37.626
You good, baby?
I'm good, mama.

05:37.627 --> 05:39.328
We don't have that dead weight
dragging us down.

05:39.329 --> 05:40.596
Let's go ladies.

05:48.438 --> 05:51.106
I just needed a rest.

05:51.107 --> 05:54.243
And I'm gonna bounce back
really fast.

05:54.244 --> 05:57.246
All right, Jacqueline,
so what did I miss?

05:57.247 --> 05:59.615
What'd you miss?
You missed everything.

06:02.218 --> 06:03.986
All right, ladies.
Let's go.

06:03.987 --> 06:05.220
Yes, chef.

06:05.221 --> 06:09.091
Guys, line up.
Let's go. Quickly.

06:09.092 --> 06:12.895
We are opening Hell's Kitchen
for the 11th time.

06:12.896 --> 06:15.164
<i>Whoo! Oh, yes. It's a big one.</i>

06:15.165 --> 06:17.266
Let's do it.

06:17.267 --> 06:19.001
Let's be honest.

06:19.002 --> 06:21.470
I'm not looking for perfection.
Let's get that right.

06:21.471 --> 06:24.173
But I am expecting each
and every one of you

06:24.174 --> 06:25.841
to give your best,

06:25.842 --> 06:28.677
and for every customer
to be fed.

06:28.678 --> 06:32.714
So I'm guaranteeing
a complete dinner service.

06:32.715 --> 06:33.916
How's that sound?

06:33.917 --> 06:35.050
Yes, chef.

06:35.051 --> 06:36.618
<i>Guaranteed.</i>

06:36.619 --> 06:37.886
Oh, my God.

06:37.887 --> 06:39.388
<i>This is our first night
of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

06:39.389 --> 06:41.190
That's not an easy thing to do.

06:41.191 --> 06:45.260
We will stop at nothing
to complete a service.

06:47.530 --> 06:49.565
<i>Sorry, chef.
Oh, come on, J.P.</i>

06:49.566 --> 06:53.068
John Philippe!

06:53.069 --> 06:54.636
Oh, my God, J.P.?

06:54.637 --> 06:56.939
Where has he been
for three years?

06:56.940 --> 06:59.074
I told you
to be here yesterday.

06:59.075 --> 07:01.643
Got delayed.
I really tried to be on time.

07:01.644 --> 07:03.979
Get changed, J.P.
I'm pissed off.

07:03.980 --> 07:06.882
<i>Honestly? Unreal.</i>

07:06.883 --> 07:08.417
Okay, get on your stations.

07:08.418 --> 07:10.018
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>

07:10.019 --> 07:10.986
Open Hell's Kitchen.

07:10.987 --> 07:13.522
Yes, chef.

07:24.868 --> 07:27.302
Let's go, guys.
Come on, let's go.

07:27.303 --> 07:29.371
Tonight is the grand re-opening

07:29.372 --> 07:31.106
of Hell's Kitchen.

07:31.107 --> 07:32.241
The beef Wellington.

07:32.242 --> 07:33.509
I'll have the halibut.

07:33.510 --> 07:35.344
And in addition
to his classic menu,

07:35.345 --> 07:37.946
chef Ramsay has added
a tableside appetizer

07:37.947 --> 07:40.182
of ale-steamed mussels,
which will be served

07:40.183 --> 07:43.051
by Amanda in the red section
of the dining room

07:43.052 --> 07:46.922
and by Christian
in the blue section.

07:46.923 --> 07:48.190
And it's accurate.

07:48.191 --> 07:50.492
J.P.
Yeah?

07:50.493 --> 07:52.227
I need the tickets.

07:52.228 --> 07:53.395
Yes, chef.

07:53.396 --> 07:54.930
You know, you disappear
for three years

07:54.931 --> 07:56.765
and then you turn up late.
Sorry, chef.

07:56.766 --> 07:58.433
How rude.

07:58.434 --> 08:00.102
Okay, ladies.

08:00.103 --> 08:01.170
On order.
First ticket in.

08:01.171 --> 08:02.771
<i>Three couples, table 31.</i>

08:02.772 --> 08:04.506
Two burrata, one scallops,
one mussels.

08:04.507 --> 08:05.607
Yes, chef.

08:05.608 --> 08:07.042
<i>Okay, do you have a spatula?</i>

08:07.043 --> 08:09.077
Where's the ones
I flip the scallops with?

08:09.078 --> 08:10.612
What?
Where's the other ones?

08:10.613 --> 08:11.980
That's these ones.

08:11.981 --> 08:13.182
Crazy Gina.

08:13.183 --> 08:14.483
She doesn't know
what she's doing.

08:14.484 --> 08:15.584
She hasn't been here all day.

08:15.585 --> 08:18.320
Now she wants to cook scallops.

08:18.321 --> 08:19.721
Really?

08:22.992 --> 08:25.460
Gina's in la-la land,
flipping the scallops

08:25.461 --> 08:26.628
a million times.

08:26.629 --> 08:27.729
You know, it's a simple sear.

08:27.730 --> 08:31.233
One side, other side,
that's it.

08:31.234 --> 08:34.236
Over and over, come on.

08:34.236 --> 08:36.471
Don't flip it back over.
Don't flip it back over.

08:36.472 --> 08:39.408
You ready, scallops?
Yes, ready.

08:39.409 --> 08:41.977
Okay. Lock it, girl.
Lock it.

08:41.977 --> 08:45.214
God only knows what these
scallops are going to be like.

08:45.215 --> 08:48.750
This is not the way
the red kitchen wants to start.

08:48.751 --> 08:50.619
Who cooked the scallops?
Here we go.

08:50.620 --> 08:51.787
We're already
going to get laid into.

08:51.788 --> 08:53.655
Who cooked them?
I did, chef.

08:53.656 --> 08:54.723
Ugh.

08:54.724 --> 08:56.892
Excellent.

08:56.893 --> 08:59.995
Thank you.

08:59.996 --> 09:01.863
These are
the immaculate scallops.

09:01.864 --> 09:04.600
How does this happen?
Good job, girl.

09:04.601 --> 09:06.802
To the shock
of her teammates,

09:06.803 --> 09:08.570
Gina has delivered
perfect scallops.

09:08.571 --> 09:10.072
Told you I can cook scallops.

09:10.073 --> 09:11.473
While in the blue kitchen,

09:11.474 --> 09:13.275
the men can't even deliver...

09:13.276 --> 09:16.612
On order, two risotto,
one mussels, one scallops.

09:16.613 --> 09:19.214
A response.

09:20.450 --> 09:22.751
The correct response
is, "Yes, chef."

09:22.752 --> 09:25.487
The blue team's response is...

09:25.488 --> 09:26.488
Guys!

09:26.489 --> 09:27.656
Yes, chef.

09:27.657 --> 09:29.024
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:29.025 --> 09:30.425
For all the
appetizers to be delivered

09:30.426 --> 09:32.828
to the first table
at the same time,

09:32.829 --> 09:34.863
Sebastian on appetizers
in the kitchen

09:34.864 --> 09:37.899
must be in total synch with
Christian in the dining room.

09:37.900 --> 09:40.168
Would you guys like that
spicy or mild?

09:40.169 --> 09:42.504
A slight kick.
Slight kick.

09:42.505 --> 09:44.339
Let's start
rocking the little pan.

09:44.340 --> 09:46.041
I've worked
in different restaurants.

09:46.042 --> 09:47.276
I know how to make risotto,
but, like,

09:47.277 --> 09:49.311
I've never really focused much

09:49.312 --> 09:50.612
on cooking Italian food.

09:50.613 --> 09:52.414
I'm not putting it down.
It's just, like,

09:52.415 --> 09:54.616
I'm Mexican, so I like
those spices more.

09:54.617 --> 09:56.451
Sebastian, how long?
Walking it now!

09:56.452 --> 09:58.020
<i>Thank you.
There you go.</i>

09:58.021 --> 09:59.321
Scallops walking through.
Scallops just walked.

09:59.322 --> 10:01.023
Thank you.
Scallops walking by to pass.

10:01.024 --> 10:02.758
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse me, chef.

10:02.759 --> 10:04.726
Behind you, chef.
Hot.

10:07.397 --> 10:09.765
<i>That's raw.</i>

10:11.634 --> 10:12.934
All of you, come here quick.

10:12.935 --> 10:14.503
And I mean quick.

10:14.504 --> 10:15.804
Spoon, taste.

10:15.805 --> 10:18.340
Oh, my God. Here we go.
Please, no.

10:18.341 --> 10:19.775
Our first ticket.

10:19.776 --> 10:21.710
Undercooked.
These are... yeah.

10:21.711 --> 10:23.912
Regroup and get it together.

10:23.913 --> 10:25.547
Yes, chef.

10:25.548 --> 10:27.582
Gonna get it together, chef.
Gonna get it together.

10:29.118 --> 10:31.920
Zach, the scallops
were cooked beautifully.

10:31.921 --> 10:32.888
Thank you, chef.

10:32.889 --> 10:35.157
I don't know what to do.

10:35.158 --> 10:37.626
My mussels are ready,
so I said, it.

10:37.627 --> 10:39.394
Put them right in front here.
Enjoy, guy.

10:39.395 --> 10:40.595
I'm really pissed right now.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.364
I'm doing my part out there,

10:42.365 --> 10:44.499
and my team can't get
the first table together.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.201
Oh, and by the way, the mussels

10:46.202 --> 10:47.669
are being served to the table.

10:47.670 --> 10:50.105
While Sebastian
starts over on the risotto,

10:50.106 --> 10:51.173
Gina...

10:51.174 --> 10:52.774
Nedra, how long
for the risotto?

10:52.775 --> 10:54.409
I need five minutes on risotto.

10:54.410 --> 10:57.412
Is anxious to prove
her earlier success was no fluke.

10:57.413 --> 11:00.048
<i>How long on
that risotto, Nedra?</i>

11:00.049 --> 11:02.250
Nedra? You almost done?

11:02.251 --> 11:04.286
Bitch, I just told you
five minutes.

11:04.287 --> 11:06.788
I know how long
it take to cook scallops.

11:06.789 --> 11:07.856
Scallops, how long?

11:07.857 --> 11:10.158
<i>How long for that risotto?</i>

11:10.159 --> 11:11.326
"How much longer?
How much longer?"

11:11.327 --> 11:12.728
Shut up, Gina.

11:12.729 --> 11:15.197
Nedra?

11:15.198 --> 11:17.866
Nedra won't tell me anything.

11:17.867 --> 11:20.001
Scallops going in.

11:20.002 --> 11:21.603
So I'm whipping up
the scallops.

11:21.604 --> 11:23.171
Scallops ready.

11:23.172 --> 11:24.473
Uh, no.
No, no, no, no.

11:24.474 --> 11:28.076
I need two minutes on risotto.
Two minutes.

11:28.077 --> 11:29.077
You crazy bitch.

11:29.078 --> 11:30.912
Why did you cook the scallops?

11:30.913 --> 11:33.749
Walking with risotto.
Walking scallops.

11:35.284 --> 11:37.452
<i>Right behind you, chef. Hot.</i>

11:39.689 --> 11:42.591
All of you, come here.

11:42.592 --> 11:44.826
Let me show you
a little waterfall.

11:44.827 --> 11:45.927
Oh, my gosh.

11:45.928 --> 11:47.362
Just touch them.

11:47.363 --> 11:48.730
Cold, overcooked.

11:48.731 --> 11:49.865
Switch up scallops, guys.

11:49.866 --> 11:51.466
Mary, do you want
to do scallops?

11:51.467 --> 11:53.802
No, I want to do scallops.

11:53.803 --> 11:56.972
Somebody else
has got to do risotto.

11:56.973 --> 11:58.273
What do you mean?

11:58.274 --> 12:00.008
Oh, hell no.

12:00.009 --> 12:02.077
Gina, don't throw me
under the bus

12:02.078 --> 12:03.645
because your
ain't right.

12:03.646 --> 12:05.347
How long on scallops?

12:05.348 --> 12:07.783
Nedra, just off.

12:07.784 --> 12:09.217
You got some good color
on there.

12:09.218 --> 12:10.619
Don't burn it.

12:10.620 --> 12:13.088
This bitch couldn't
cook a scallop to save her life.

12:13.089 --> 12:16.224
And I know that
chef is about to find out.

12:16.225 --> 12:18.026
I got the scallops ready.

12:18.027 --> 12:19.561
Go, Gina.
You got to go.

12:19.562 --> 12:20.896
Walking scallops, chef.

12:20.897 --> 12:23.865
Mm-hmm.
Good luck to you, Gina.

12:23.866 --> 12:26.735
Risotto right behind
you, chef. Hot.

12:26.736 --> 12:29.971
Ah.

12:29.972 --> 12:32.107
All of you, come here.

12:34.043 --> 12:40.015
I guaranteed
a complete service tonight.

12:40.016 --> 12:42.250
<i>You can't even hold it together
for the second ticket.</i>

12:42.251 --> 12:44.052
Get out, Gina.

12:47.623 --> 12:50.792
Nedra, the risotto
was delicious.

12:50.793 --> 12:53.195
<i>Thank you, chef.
Let's go, ladies.</i>

12:53.196 --> 12:55.330
A beep, beep whoo!

12:56.933 --> 12:58.567
Nedra.

12:58.568 --> 13:00.569
How many minutes?
"Uh, five minutes."

13:00.570 --> 13:03.705
Okay, that was
two minutes ago.

13:03.706 --> 13:05.307
I am so pissed.

13:05.308 --> 13:07.742
Those little bitches.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.211
They better watch out.

13:09.212 --> 13:11.313
There's gonna be war.

13:19.843 --> 13:21.710
It's opening night
in Hell's Kitchen,

13:21.711 --> 13:22.911
and the red team...

13:22.912 --> 13:24.246
Get out, Gina.

13:24.247 --> 13:26.215
Once again finds themselves

13:26.216 --> 13:27.683
Gina-less in the kitchen.

13:27.684 --> 13:29.285
While on the blue side...

13:29.286 --> 13:30.686
Okay, risotto's ready, brother.

13:30.687 --> 13:32.321
Scallops walking
up to the pass.

13:32.322 --> 13:34.823
The men are finally
ready to impress chef Ramsay

13:34.824 --> 13:36.125
with their second attempt

13:36.126 --> 13:38.327
on the first order
of appetizers.

13:38.328 --> 13:40.296
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

13:40.297 --> 13:41.930
Service, please.

13:41.931 --> 13:43.432
<i>Here we go.
Come on.</i>

13:43.433 --> 13:44.933
Blue team is on a roll.

13:44.934 --> 13:46.368
Second ticket.
Keep it rolling, guys.

13:46.369 --> 13:48.003
Three cappellini,
one scallops, one mussels.

13:48.004 --> 13:50.072
How long?
I need 60 seconds.

13:50.073 --> 13:52.508
We are finally gelling together
as a team.

13:52.509 --> 13:53.542
Walking.

13:53.543 --> 13:54.777
Scallops walking
up to the pass.

13:54.778 --> 13:55.811
Excuse me, chef.

13:55.812 --> 13:57.913
Taste that.
How hot is that?

14:04.154 --> 14:05.587
All of you, taste that.

14:05.588 --> 14:09.725
It's too spicy,
and it's disgusting.

14:09.726 --> 14:11.360
Trash.

14:13.096 --> 14:15.531
And again, scallops
cooked beautifully.

14:15.532 --> 14:17.066
What the is going on?

14:17.067 --> 14:19.268
It's like deja vu
in this .

14:19.269 --> 14:21.036
How many times have
you cooked scallops tonight

14:21.037 --> 14:22.137
and not served them?

14:22.138 --> 14:24.073
Twice, chef.
Sorry, bro.

14:24.074 --> 14:26.008
Sebastian, get it together!

14:26.009 --> 14:27.109
Yes, chef.

14:27.110 --> 14:28.577
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

14:28.578 --> 14:30.446
<i>Okay, Mikey-wikey.</i>

14:30.447 --> 14:32.481
I messed up a few times,
but I'm getting in

14:32.482 --> 14:34.183
with the groove,
I'm playing around.

14:34.184 --> 14:35.250
Trying to make the environment
a little bit looser.

14:35.251 --> 14:36.785
Zachy, talk to me.

14:36.786 --> 14:38.287
We got three halibut,
one branzino.

14:38.288 --> 14:40.856
Zachy-wacky!

14:40.857 --> 14:42.491
Hey, you.

14:42.492 --> 14:43.459
Hey, come here, you.

14:43.460 --> 14:44.793
Zachy-wacky?

14:44.794 --> 14:45.928
Chef Zach!
Hey, look at me.

14:45.929 --> 14:47.329
Hey, look.
Is this a joke?

14:47.330 --> 14:49.732
<i>No, chef.
Zachy-wacky?</i>

14:49.733 --> 14:51.433
Sorry. I apologize
about that, chef.

14:51.434 --> 14:53.302
Yeah, do me a favor.
Get out!

14:53.303 --> 14:55.003
Yes, chef.
off, will you?

14:55.004 --> 14:56.805
Get out!
Yes, chef.

14:56.806 --> 14:58.140
<i>Upstairs! Get out!</i>

14:58.141 --> 14:59.775
So Sebastian gets kicked out.

14:59.776 --> 15:02.378
We didn't see that coming.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.179
Zachy-wacky?

15:05.281 --> 15:07.349
<i>What are you doing?</i>

15:07.350 --> 15:09.118
Where the hell are you going,
Sebastian?

15:09.119 --> 15:10.319
Okay, yeah, you can come back.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.121
Second time, get out!

15:12.122 --> 15:13.756
Gah, are you kidding me?

15:13.757 --> 15:15.424
off. Wacky!

15:15.425 --> 15:17.259
The blue
team is now down a chef,

15:17.260 --> 15:20.796
and it's up to jon to handle
the appetizer station solo.

15:20.797 --> 15:22.030
I need two minutes, please.

15:22.031 --> 15:23.599
While in the dining room...

15:23.600 --> 15:25.634
My blue team's backed up
a little bit,

15:25.635 --> 15:27.803
so I'm gonna give you the mussels.
Uh, okay.

15:27.804 --> 15:30.072
Christian is
successfully serving mussels...

15:30.073 --> 15:31.974
<i>Will I
still get the risotto?</i>

15:31.975 --> 15:34.676
Whether the
diners ordered them or not.

15:34.677 --> 15:36.311
I just started going to
the tables that had

15:36.312 --> 15:37.513
their food waiting for so long

15:37.514 --> 15:39.281
to try to help
our blue team out.

15:39.282 --> 15:41.049
I apologize for
the service of my team

15:41.050 --> 15:43.352
and hope you guys enjoy.

15:43.353 --> 15:45.053
Walking with risotto, guys.

15:45.054 --> 15:46.922
Meanwhile, with Gina gone,

15:46.923 --> 15:49.324
the red team is cranking out
the appetizers.

15:49.325 --> 15:50.426
Go, please.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.261
Yeah, asparagus.

15:52.262 --> 15:54.863
Now it's up to Jessica
and Cyndi on the meat station

15:54.864 --> 15:57.132
and Danielle and Susan
on garnish

15:57.133 --> 15:58.801
to keep up the momentum.

15:58.802 --> 16:00.402
On order.
Four couples, table 51.

16:00.403 --> 16:01.670
Entree one chicken,
one short rib,

16:01.671 --> 16:02.905
pasta, two Wellington.

16:02.906 --> 16:05.073
Yes, chef.

16:05.074 --> 16:07.209
I don't understand
how you're expected

16:07.210 --> 16:08.877
to remember all the tickets.

16:08.878 --> 16:10.179
Six couples, white table 30.

16:10.180 --> 16:11.680
Entree two halibut,
one bass, one pork,

16:11.681 --> 16:12.781
one lamb, one Wellington.

16:12.782 --> 16:14.149
Yes, chef.

16:14.150 --> 16:15.484
You okay?

16:15.485 --> 16:17.186
I've never worked
in a brigade before.

16:17.187 --> 16:19.188
Oh, really?
Never.

16:19.189 --> 16:22.224
I cannot believe
that Danielle is a head chef.

16:22.225 --> 16:24.259
A head chef of what?
A hot dog stand?

16:24.260 --> 16:26.094
<i>Three risotto,
two burrata.</i>

16:26.095 --> 16:27.229
<i>Let's go.</i>

16:27.230 --> 16:28.397
What are you reading that for,
Danielle?

16:28.398 --> 16:29.898
I was trying to see
if that was a ticket...

16:29.899 --> 16:31.533
just to see
what you had just called.

16:31.534 --> 16:34.136
Where is your ticket
that I've just called?

16:34.137 --> 16:36.905
<i>Well, it's supposed to be here...
And it is not there.</i>

16:36.906 --> 16:39.041
Let's walk three steps together.
Yes, chef.

16:39.042 --> 16:41.243
One, two, three, and it's there.
Yes, chef.

16:41.244 --> 16:43.912
<i>You're making such
hard work out of nothing.</i>

16:43.913 --> 16:46.215
I have no idea why Danielle
can't get it together.

16:46.216 --> 16:47.583
I'm embarrassed for her.

16:47.584 --> 16:49.785
Three steps, first ticket,
second ticket.

16:49.786 --> 16:50.853
Okay?
Yes, chef.

16:50.854 --> 16:52.988
No off.
Yes, thank you.

16:52.989 --> 16:55.657
While Danielle
gets a lesson in Kitchen 101,

16:55.658 --> 16:57.025
on the blue side...

16:57.026 --> 16:59.294
My risotto's ready to walk, dude.
Yeah, let's go.

16:59.295 --> 17:01.563
Jon, without
the help of Sebastian...

17:01.564 --> 17:03.432
Good.
Service, let's go.

17:03.433 --> 17:04.933
Has gotten
the men back on track.

17:04.934 --> 17:06.101
Thank you, buddy.

17:06.102 --> 17:07.703
<i>It looks really nice.</i>

17:07.704 --> 17:10.038
And they are now
ready to move on to entrees.

17:10.039 --> 17:11.772
Two lamb, two Wellington.
Five minutes to the window.

17:11.773 --> 17:13.541
Yes, chef.
Five minutes, in the window.

17:13.542 --> 17:15.777
I'm pretty excited
about working meat tonight.

17:15.778 --> 17:17.546
I decided that
I was going to do the lamb,

17:17.547 --> 17:19.047
and Barret has the Wellington.

17:19.048 --> 17:20.348
Wellington's in.

17:20.349 --> 17:21.849
I cook lamb every day.

17:21.851 --> 17:23.752
I mean, we run it for specials.

17:23.752 --> 17:26.221
I was even thinking about
putting it on my next menu.

17:26.222 --> 17:28.957
Jeremy, 2 1/2 out on two lamb
and two Wellington.

17:28.958 --> 17:30.759
<i>Got it?
Got it.</i>

17:30.760 --> 17:32.027
I need to still cut it.

17:32.028 --> 17:33.829
You don't think
that's still raw?

17:33.830 --> 17:35.931
Not once it rests, bro.
All right.

17:35.932 --> 17:37.599
<i>Ready to go?
Put in the pass.</i>

17:37.600 --> 17:39.701
I know my lamb's
perfectly cooked,

17:39.702 --> 17:41.937
so I don't think
we have anything to worry about.

17:41.938 --> 17:43.872
That's raw.

17:45.308 --> 17:46.808
Yeah, hey, come here.
Come here.

17:46.809 --> 17:48.510
Oh, my God.

17:49.846 --> 17:52.047
<i>That you want to re-fire, chef.</i>

17:52.048 --> 17:53.515
You've got to be
kidding me, man.

17:53.516 --> 17:55.817
Like, suddenly I don't know
how to cook.

17:55.818 --> 17:58.620
Firing another Wellington.

17:58.621 --> 18:00.656
While the blue
kitchen waits for a do-over

18:00.657 --> 18:02.891
on Michael's lamb,
over in the red kitchen...

18:02.892 --> 18:04.359
Keep it going. You had
two Wellington, one lamb.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.727
How long?
Six minutes, chef.

18:05.728 --> 18:07.262
Let's go.

18:07.263 --> 18:09.298
Chef Ramsay is
looking for Cyndi and Jessica

18:09.299 --> 18:10.899
to deliver on the meat station.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.601
<i>You putting your lamb back in?
No.</i>

18:12.602 --> 18:13.869
You've got to brown
off the crust and then

18:13.870 --> 18:14.903
we got to let it rest
before we slice it.

18:14.904 --> 18:15.971
Oh, you're right.

18:15.972 --> 18:17.973
Jessica's fresh
out of culinary school,

18:17.974 --> 18:19.908
so this could be a disaster.

18:19.909 --> 18:21.743
Lamb!

18:21.744 --> 18:22.978
<i>Lamb, slicing.</i>

18:22.979 --> 18:24.613
It's ready to go.
She basically

18:24.614 --> 18:26.415
just has to slice and walk.

18:26.416 --> 18:28.417
!

18:28.418 --> 18:31.320
This is not rocket science.

18:39.095 --> 18:40.662
Seriously, slice the lamb.

18:40.663 --> 18:42.097
How long does it really take?

18:42.098 --> 18:44.232
How much of an amateur are you?

18:46.536 --> 18:47.803
<i>Where's the lamb?</i>

18:47.804 --> 18:49.504
Just cut through it, babe.
Cut through it.

18:49.505 --> 18:50.839
I'm trying.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.007
Oh, my God, this bitch

18:52.008 --> 18:54.176
is cutting lamb
for 6 hours now.

18:54.177 --> 18:57.279
Bitch, there's only
24 hours in a day.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.549
I want that lamb now.

19:00.550 --> 19:02.384
Right behind.
Right behind.

19:02.385 --> 19:04.486
Lamb rising.

19:04.487 --> 19:07.456
Lamb, chef.

19:07.457 --> 19:08.757
Oh, mother.

19:11.227 --> 19:12.828
Who cooked the lamb?
Me, chef.

19:12.829 --> 19:14.763
Perfect.
Thank you, chef.

19:14.764 --> 19:15.831
Who would have thought?

19:15.832 --> 19:17.399
Girl can cook some meat.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.368
Chicken walking.

19:19.369 --> 19:21.603
While the red
team pushes out entrees...

19:21.604 --> 19:22.671
Service, let's go.

19:22.672 --> 19:24.973
Looks great.
Ank you so much.

19:24.974 --> 19:26.608
Over in the blue kitchen...

19:26.609 --> 19:28.977
Garnish, two lamb,
two Wellington.

19:28.978 --> 19:30.345
Barret's
re-fire Wellingtons...

19:30.346 --> 19:31.680
We're good.
We're good.

19:31.681 --> 19:33.081
Are perfectly cooked,

19:33.082 --> 19:34.716
but Michael's lamb...

19:34.717 --> 19:36.551
<i>Guys, I'm not
sending it out under.</i>

19:36.552 --> 19:38.320
Could use
a little more time.

19:38.321 --> 19:39.721
I got to go with these.

19:39.722 --> 19:42.090
Don't go up there yet, bro.
The lamb is not ready.

19:42.091 --> 19:43.425
Michael's lamb is not ready.

19:43.426 --> 19:45.661
Come on, guys.
I'm waiting on the lamb, chef.

19:45.662 --> 19:46.762
I'm sorry.
You're waiting on the lamb?

19:46.763 --> 19:47.763
<i>(Michael yeah.</i>

19:47.764 --> 19:49.097
I was waiting for the lamb,

19:49.098 --> 19:50.432
waiting for the lamb,
waiting for the lamb.

19:50.433 --> 19:52.801
It's, like, medium.
It's not medium rare anymore.

19:52.802 --> 19:55.203
You need to go.
Yeah, hold on, hold on.

19:55.204 --> 19:56.371
Wait for me.

19:56.372 --> 19:58.473
Can't rest no more.
We got to go.

19:58.474 --> 19:59.941
Guys, walking two Wellington.

19:59.942 --> 20:00.942
me, man.

20:00.943 --> 20:02.811
Barret, thanks for that, buddy.

20:02.812 --> 20:04.413
That's .

20:04.414 --> 20:06.148
I just can't believe
this is happening right now.

20:06.149 --> 20:07.215
Lamb!

20:07.216 --> 20:09.785
Come on, Michael,
a bit of energy.

20:09.786 --> 20:11.420
Yes, chef.

20:11.421 --> 20:14.022
Terrible.
Embarrassing.

20:15.324 --> 20:16.358
Oh, God.

20:16.359 --> 20:19.861
It's coming back.

20:19.862 --> 20:22.230
Time out. Stop!

20:25.501 --> 20:28.870
The bone thicker
than the meat.

20:28.871 --> 20:30.005
There needs to be meat
on there.

20:30.006 --> 20:32.808
This is not a
dog's chew toy.

20:32.809 --> 20:34.042
This is lamb.

20:34.043 --> 20:36.278
And if that's not bad enough...

20:37.480 --> 20:38.980
They're way overcooked.

20:38.981 --> 20:40.348
Horrible. .

20:40.349 --> 20:43.618
Michael and Barret,
dumb and dumber.

20:43.619 --> 20:45.153
You don't slice the Wellington

20:45.154 --> 20:47.089
until the lamb's ready.
Yes, chef.

20:47.090 --> 20:49.124
And when it's together like...
Oh, you.

20:49.125 --> 20:50.892
Chef, can I please
come back, chef?

20:50.893 --> 20:52.394
Dude, really,
what are you doing?

20:52.395 --> 20:53.962
Perfect timing.

20:53.963 --> 20:56.932
You. You come here, you.

20:56.933 --> 20:58.900
You're making me look stupid.
No, chef.

20:58.901 --> 21:01.770
The blue team,
one hour into service

21:01.771 --> 21:04.639
and not one entree out.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.875
You, for the last time,

21:06.876 --> 21:08.719
take him and him...

21:10.413 --> 21:11.526
And get out!

21:18.477 --> 21:19.777
It's just over an hour

21:19.778 --> 21:21.646
into Hell's Kitchen's
opening night,

21:21.647 --> 21:24.082
and the blue team
has failed to deliver

21:24.083 --> 21:25.717
a single entree
to the dining room.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.118
How much longer could it be?

21:27.119 --> 21:29.153
And the unwelcome
return of Sebastian...

21:29.154 --> 21:30.188
Chef, can I please
come back, chef?

21:30.189 --> 21:31.990
You. You come here, you.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.559
Has pushed
chef Ramsay to the limit.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.661
You, for the last time,

21:36.662 --> 21:39.230
take him and him and get out!

21:39.231 --> 21:40.765
<i>And let me
tell you something.</i>

21:40.766 --> 21:42.467
You come back downstairs again,

21:42.468 --> 21:43.634
you'll be leaving
through the front door.

21:43.635 --> 21:45.069
Now get out!
Yes, chef.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.904
Three of you.

21:46.905 --> 21:48.172
You, on meat.
Yes, chef.

21:48.173 --> 21:51.209
You, on meat.
Yes, chef.

21:51.210 --> 21:54.212
Hey, get out!

21:54.213 --> 21:55.413
Now I'm pissed off.

21:55.414 --> 21:56.981
I didn't do anything
to get kicked out

21:56.982 --> 21:58.816
of this dinner service.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.518
Chef Ramsay
looks to Ray and Anthony

22:00.519 --> 22:02.453
to step up and rescue the meat.

22:02.454 --> 22:04.088
They're already cut.
Close 'em up.

22:04.089 --> 22:05.390
But over
in the red kitchen...

22:05.391 --> 22:06.824
Where is the kale?

22:06.825 --> 22:08.426
He's looking
for something else.

22:08.427 --> 22:10.995
<i>Kale?
Yes, chef.</i>

22:10.996 --> 22:13.464
Black kale for the lamb...
Look at you both staring.

22:13.465 --> 22:15.299
You're not even
answering me, Danielle.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.402
Danielle, get it together.

22:17.403 --> 22:19.737
She's cooked the lamb perfectly
and garnish.

22:19.738 --> 22:20.872
<i>Where's the kale?
.</i>

22:20.873 --> 22:22.173
Come on, Danielle!

22:22.174 --> 22:23.341
I'm trying.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.209
I've never
done this before.

22:25.210 --> 22:26.644
I need the kale.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.713
<i>Protein's nailed perfectly.</i>

22:28.714 --> 22:30.648
We're missing the kale.

22:30.649 --> 22:32.116
Danielle!

22:32.117 --> 22:35.286
It absolutely will be one minute.
Yes, chef. Yes, chef.

22:35.287 --> 22:37.188
Just lightly, lightly,
lightly tossed.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.856
Danielle's all over the place.

22:38.857 --> 22:39.891
She doesn't know
what she's doing.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.893
Like that?
More along this color.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.395
I'm spending more time
babysitting Danielle

22:44.396 --> 22:46.464
than I am worrying about
my own garnish.

22:46.465 --> 22:48.466
Behind.
Finally.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.904
Ladies!

22:52.905 --> 22:54.305
<i>Touch them.</i>

22:54.306 --> 22:55.373
All right, chef.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.041
Oh, my God.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.609
That's my garnish.

22:58.610 --> 22:59.577
Who cooked them?

22:59.578 --> 23:00.678
I did, chef.

23:00.679 --> 23:03.214
Yeah. You, get out.
Get out!

23:04.483 --> 23:05.783
Hey, madam.
You think it's funny?

23:05.784 --> 23:07.685
No, no, no.
Take your with you.

23:07.686 --> 23:09.387
I know that this is not funny.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.022
I don't deserve to be
kicked out of the kitchen...

23:11.023 --> 23:12.156
Danielle does.

23:12.157 --> 23:13.991
She was the one
bringing the station down.

23:13.992 --> 23:15.893
Danielle,
don't stop the re-do.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.428
Hurry up.

23:17.429 --> 23:19.063
<i>After that, two
chicken, two Wellington.</i>

23:19.064 --> 23:21.099
Two chicken, two Wellington.
Yes, chef.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.267
Sorry, chef.
I'm confused.

23:23.268 --> 23:25.069
Do you need the one
for the re-do

23:25.070 --> 23:27.105
and the two chicken
and two Wellington?

23:27.106 --> 23:31.042
Or do you just need the two
chicken and two Wellington?

23:31.043 --> 23:32.310
Get out!

23:34.513 --> 23:35.680
Get out!

23:35.681 --> 23:37.148
It's just really hard.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.917
And it's a lot harder
than people know.

23:41.386 --> 23:43.121
While the women
look for someone to step up

23:43.122 --> 23:44.155
on the garnish station...

23:44.156 --> 23:45.389
Let's go.
Someone help.

23:45.390 --> 23:46.791
We've got to get
this chicken garnish going.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.025
Chef Ramsay...

23:48.026 --> 23:49.894
Blue team, let's go.

23:49.895 --> 23:52.096
Pushes the men
to keep the entrees coming.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.264
Walking, chef.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.465
Two lamb, chef.

23:54.466 --> 23:55.600
Service, please.

23:55.601 --> 23:58.102
Mm. Cooked perfectly.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.237
Keep it rolling, guys.

23:59.238 --> 24:00.438
Three halibut,
one bass, one chicken.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.439
Come on, guys.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.474
Yes, chef.

24:07.346 --> 24:09.947
I'm looking at Jeremy
sauteing off kale.

24:09.948 --> 24:14.385
I can see the kale literally
catching fire, getting burnt.

24:14.386 --> 24:16.120
Chef, turn that down some,
chef.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.456
Yeah, yeah.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.590
Yeah, don't even serve that.

24:19.591 --> 24:21.559
I'm not.
Worry about your side.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.327
Let me do my side, yeah?

24:23.328 --> 24:25.296
What?

24:25.297 --> 24:27.832
Hey, no territory .

24:29.401 --> 24:31.802
It's my station
and I don't need his help.

24:31.803 --> 24:34.038
So shut up and do what
you're supposed to be doing.

24:34.039 --> 24:35.973
Un...believable.

24:35.974 --> 24:38.409
Here we go with three halibut,
one bass, one chicken.

24:38.410 --> 24:39.744
Yes, chef.
Seven minutes to the window.

24:39.745 --> 24:40.945
What we going with?

24:40.946 --> 24:42.547
Two... uh, two halibuts
and one chicken, chef.

24:42.548 --> 24:43.814
Three halibuts.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.183
Three halibut
and one chicken, chef.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.018
Three halibut, one bass,
one chicken.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.452
<i>What we going with?</i>

24:48.453 --> 24:53.457
Three halibut, uh...

24:56.028 --> 24:58.229
Jeremy, he's
telling it to you.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.597
Just say it right back, man.

24:59.598 --> 25:01.465
I'm pretty sure birds
can do that.

25:01.466 --> 25:04.068
Three halibuts, one bass,
one chicken.

25:04.069 --> 25:05.203
What's going?

25:05.204 --> 25:08.940
The three halibut,
two... two, uh.

25:08.941 --> 25:11.676
Two... two.

25:11.677 --> 25:12.977
Get out!

25:12.978 --> 25:14.912
Bye-bye, Jeremy.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.918
It's 90 minutes
into opening night.

25:20.919 --> 25:22.386
Mary.
Yes, chef?

25:22.387 --> 25:23.754
Garnish.

25:23.755 --> 25:25.156
And with three
members of the red team

25:25.157 --> 25:26.857
already kicked out
of the kitchen...

25:26.858 --> 25:28.893
I've never worked in a
brigade before.

25:28.894 --> 25:30.394
The rest of
the team is struggling

25:30.395 --> 25:32.029
to fill the vacancies...

25:32.030 --> 25:33.297
Send it without potatoes.

25:33.298 --> 25:34.665
Forcing
chef Ramsay to take

25:34.666 --> 25:37.268
the unusual measure
of sending the entree

25:37.269 --> 25:39.503
without the garnish,
in hopes he will catch up

25:39.504 --> 25:42.073
on the order
before the diner notices.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.174
Go, please.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.909
We'll send the potatoes
separate.

25:44.910 --> 25:46.677
Right, potatoes,
we're dragging,

25:46.678 --> 25:48.012
with chorizo, urgently.

25:48.013 --> 25:49.380
Yes, chef.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.915
I'm swamped right now.

25:50.916 --> 25:52.550
A few of the girls
got kicked out,

25:52.551 --> 25:53.884
and now I'm on fish.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.187
And on top of that,
now I'm on the garnish station.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.189
Oh, my God.

25:59.658 --> 26:01.292
Anybody gonna help her?

26:01.293 --> 26:03.761
<i>Jacqueline, don't
stand there staring.</i>

26:03.762 --> 26:05.029
There's always something to do.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.130
Yes, chef.

26:06.131 --> 26:07.365
Chef Ramsay
doesn't stress me out.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.767
I'm just like, "relax.

26:09.768 --> 26:11.769
Channel the inner zen."

26:13.605 --> 26:16.774
Guys, I need to get my bass in.
Watch out.

26:16.775 --> 26:18.376
I'm looking at Jacqueline.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.411
She not doing
a damn thing right now.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.480
I need water.

26:24.149 --> 26:25.416
Uh, madam?

26:28.153 --> 26:29.253
Yeah, it needs garnish.

26:29.254 --> 26:30.488
You're absolutely right.
My apologies.

26:30.489 --> 26:31.722
Give me two minutes.

26:31.723 --> 26:33.758
So now the customer's
at the window.

26:33.759 --> 26:37.328
Seven minutes ago,
we served the chicken

26:37.329 --> 26:38.696
and where are the potatoes?

26:38.697 --> 26:41.866
Coming, chef.
30 seconds.

26:41.867 --> 26:44.702
What are you doing?
I had to get my water, chef.

26:44.703 --> 26:47.238
Get out.
All right.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.372
Get out!

26:48.373 --> 26:49.807
Chef Ramsay told me to get out,

26:49.808 --> 26:51.108
and I'm like, "All right.

26:51.109 --> 26:53.577
I'm going to go upstairs
and rehydrate myself."

26:53.578 --> 26:55.079
Mary! Garnish.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.380
Coming, chef.

26:56.381 --> 26:58.215
Thanks to
Mary, the red team

26:58.216 --> 27:00.017
finally delivers
the missing potatoes.

27:00.018 --> 27:01.419
Hot pan, chef.

27:01.420 --> 27:02.653
But in the blue kitchen...

27:02.654 --> 27:03.921
The chicken is going first.

27:03.922 --> 27:05.289
Chef Ramsay finds himself

27:05.290 --> 27:07.124
asking a familiar question.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.427
Where's the chicken garnish?

27:09.428 --> 27:11.796
Walking.
Garnish the chicken.

27:11.797 --> 27:14.231
<i>And what about
the risotto appetizer?</i>

27:14.232 --> 27:16.100
Yeah, 45 seconds.

27:16.101 --> 27:18.803
They need to be more cooked.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.538
Dan, come here.

27:20.539 --> 27:22.573
Just touch that.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.475
<i>Hard, chef.
Dan, please, come on.</i>

27:24.476 --> 27:25.976
We, like, five people down
in the kitchen.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.878
<i>I need you, baby.
I know that.</i>

27:27.879 --> 27:30.715
We are going to complete
dinner service, no matter what.

27:30.716 --> 27:32.016
Two risotto going up.

27:32.017 --> 27:34.085
Two risotto.

27:35.887 --> 27:38.556
Oh, man.

27:38.557 --> 27:39.924
Look at that, there.

27:39.925 --> 27:41.125
Stuck to the bottom of the pan.

27:41.126 --> 27:42.493
, man.

27:42.494 --> 27:46.297
Jon, take Dan and yourself

27:46.298 --> 27:48.165
and get the
out of here.

27:50.869 --> 27:51.902
When somebody gets kicked out
of the kitchen,

27:51.903 --> 27:53.771
it put more pressure
on the next man.

27:53.772 --> 27:55.406
Whew.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.742
Raymond, taste that.

27:57.743 --> 28:00.177
Fingers.
Spoons are everywhere.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.213
Bland, chef.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.548
Ray, you just stuck your finger

28:04.549 --> 28:08.185
into a risotto in front of
chef Ramsay in Hell's Kitchen.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.887
That's just stupid.

28:09.888 --> 28:12.490
You may be the oldest,
but out of respect, off.

28:12.491 --> 28:15.059
Yes, chef.

28:15.060 --> 28:16.527
You got to be .

28:16.528 --> 28:18.496
Blue kitchen tonight is like

28:18.497 --> 28:20.765
being in the middle
of a natural disaster.

28:20.766 --> 28:23.100
My heart is beating.

28:23.101 --> 28:24.568
I'm not feeling good right now.

28:24.569 --> 28:26.670
It's getting hot.
I start feeling pressure.

28:26.671 --> 28:28.272
You good? You good?

28:28.273 --> 28:30.941
I got to just breathe, Holmes.

28:30.942 --> 28:32.243
Risotto?

28:32.244 --> 28:35.246
Risotto, chef.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.148
Just taste that.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.482
Yeah, .

28:40.552 --> 28:42.286
Get out, get out.

28:44.055 --> 28:45.356
Another person gets kicked out.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.291
That's, like,
another blow to me.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.428
I started to feel something
in my stomach.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.998
I literally feel
my body shutting down.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.800
W-where's Zach?

28:55.801 --> 28:57.268
Oh, my God.

28:57.269 --> 28:58.402
Zach keeps leaving the kitchen.

28:59.805 --> 29:01.071
All I'm thinking to myself is,

29:01.072 --> 29:02.506
"Don't go under.
Don't go under."

29:03.842 --> 29:05.810
Zach.

29:05.811 --> 29:07.344
Zach!

29:14.512 --> 29:16.012
It's two hours into

29:16.013 --> 29:17.847
the grand re-opening
of Hell's Kitchen,

29:17.848 --> 29:19.382
and in the blue kitchen,

29:19.383 --> 29:21.017
Zach is
the last man standing...

29:22.319 --> 29:23.420
...Barely.

29:23.421 --> 29:24.421
I'm feeling dehydrated.

29:24.422 --> 29:25.522
It's getting hot.

29:25.523 --> 29:27.557
And I'm starting
to lose consciousness.

29:27.558 --> 29:29.893
Oh, my God.

29:29.894 --> 29:31.895
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

29:34.031 --> 29:35.865
Where's Zach?

29:35.866 --> 29:38.702
Zach! Zach!

29:38.703 --> 29:39.803
What are you doing?

29:39.804 --> 29:40.837
I'm throwing up for a minute.

29:40.838 --> 29:41.871
Let me just
get this out, please.

29:41.872 --> 29:42.872
Throwing up.

29:42.873 --> 29:45.141
Throwing up.
Oh, me.

29:45.142 --> 29:46.209
Oh, God.

29:46.210 --> 29:47.610
I'm literally telling myself,

29:47.611 --> 29:48.845
"If you think that, you know,

29:48.846 --> 29:51.114
"you going to pass out,

29:51.115 --> 29:53.016
guess what.
Think again."

29:53.017 --> 29:55.351
Zach. Zach.

29:55.352 --> 29:57.587
You okay?
Yes, chef.

29:57.588 --> 29:59.122
I'm a monster.

29:59.123 --> 30:01.124
First up, two bass,
two halibut.

30:01.125 --> 30:02.992
Yeah, I'm finishing that up.
I got it, chef.

30:02.993 --> 30:05.195
Chef Zach!
Chef Zach!

30:05.196 --> 30:06.463
Bass, Zach?

30:06.464 --> 30:07.530
Hot.

30:07.531 --> 30:09.466
Two bass, chef.
Two bass.

30:09.467 --> 30:10.800
Go, please.

30:10.801 --> 30:13.002
As Zach
rises from the ashes...

30:13.003 --> 30:14.637
Whoo! Let's do it.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.072
Frustration is rising

30:16.073 --> 30:18.007
amongst the 12 ousted chefs.

30:18.008 --> 30:19.809
I got kicked out
of the kitchen 'cause

30:19.810 --> 30:21.544
I couldn't repeat back
the order.

30:21.545 --> 30:22.846
You got to repeat back
the order.

30:22.847 --> 30:24.047
You got to be able to know that
, man.

30:24.048 --> 30:26.716
Dude, communication's
crumbling.

30:26.717 --> 30:28.451
It's the first of many.

30:28.452 --> 30:30.854
I've been cooking
for half my life, okay?

30:30.855 --> 30:32.589
I've never worked
in a brigade before.

30:32.590 --> 30:35.291
There's hardly any
restaurants that work that way.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.460
Danielle is
making sure everybody knows

30:37.461 --> 30:40.396
she hasn't worked
in a brigade system before.

30:40.397 --> 30:42.398
Guess what?
We know!

30:42.399 --> 30:44.367
We know this already.

30:44.368 --> 30:47.003
None of us have ever
worked in this kitchen before.

30:47.004 --> 30:50.039
Curiosity, show of hands.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.007
Guys, how many people
have worked

30:51.008 --> 30:53.710
in a true brigade before?

30:56.580 --> 30:58.581
While Danielle
continues to ponder

30:58.582 --> 31:01.718
the mystery of the brigade
system, downstairs,

31:01.719 --> 31:04.220
the red team has finally
found their rhythm.

31:04.221 --> 31:05.755
Chicken walking.

31:05.756 --> 31:06.823
Garnish, chef.

31:06.824 --> 31:08.057
<i>Let's go.</i>

31:08.058 --> 31:09.259
And on the other side,

31:09.260 --> 31:11.861
Zach is feeling better
and entrees are flying

31:11.862 --> 31:13.530
out of the blue kitchen
as well.

31:13.531 --> 31:15.098
<i>Mmm.
That looks good.</i>

31:15.099 --> 31:16.966
Last ticket, two halibut,
two chicken.

31:16.967 --> 31:18.234
Yes, chef.

31:18.235 --> 31:20.670
I'm determined
to finish service because

31:20.671 --> 31:22.405
what don't kill you
only make you stronger.

31:22.406 --> 31:23.873
<i>I literally threw
ice on my chest.</i>

31:23.874 --> 31:24.941
Touch this.

31:24.942 --> 31:27.210
Ice.

31:27.211 --> 31:28.812
Either that or
die on the line.

31:28.813 --> 31:30.914
Last table, girls, last table.

31:30.915 --> 31:31.981
Ready, girls?
I'm walking.

31:31.982 --> 31:33.016
Coming right behind you.

31:33.017 --> 31:34.250
The asparagus salad, chef.

31:34.251 --> 31:35.318
Service, please.

31:35.319 --> 31:37.153
I'm feeling really good
right now.

31:37.154 --> 31:39.689
We completed
the first dinner service.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.858
This is unbelievable.

31:41.859 --> 31:42.859
There you are, chef.

31:42.860 --> 31:43.860
Two halibut, two chicken.

31:43.861 --> 31:46.229
Perfect.

31:46.230 --> 31:47.397
Go, please.

31:47.398 --> 31:48.198
I knocked that
out the park.

31:48.199 --> 31:49.499
Last man standing.

31:49.500 --> 31:52.502
Chef Zach is the man tonight.

31:57.141 --> 31:58.741
Tonight I guaranteed that
we would

31:58.742 --> 32:02.178
complete a dinner service,

32:02.179 --> 32:07.217
but I expected all of you
to be here when I finished.

32:07.218 --> 32:08.651
It was a difficult evening,

32:08.652 --> 32:11.721
but I will
choose a winning team.

32:14.592 --> 32:15.658
The red team.

32:15.659 --> 32:16.960
Congratulations.

32:16.961 --> 32:18.795
<i>Good job, baby, good job.</i>

32:19.997 --> 32:22.765
Zach, you gave it your all.
Yes, chef.

32:22.766 --> 32:25.101
That's the kind of commitment
I want to see

32:25.102 --> 32:26.936
each and every service,
all of you.

32:26.937 --> 32:28.504
It's going to get harder.

32:28.505 --> 32:31.274
Blue team, time to do something

32:31.275 --> 32:33.576
that you couldn't do tonight.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.578
I'd like each
and every one of you now

32:35.579 --> 32:40.383
to work as a team
and decide which two chefs

32:40.384 --> 32:44.387
you'd like to nominate to get
the out of here tonight.

32:46.123 --> 32:48.658
Now off.

32:48.659 --> 32:49.859
Yes, chef.

32:52.763 --> 32:55.131
My team, they let me down.

32:55.132 --> 32:57.200
But I guarantee you
the guilty parties

32:57.201 --> 32:59.102
will be penalized
to the utmost.

33:02.606 --> 33:04.440
The two stations
that dropped their ball

33:04.441 --> 33:08.845
was Sebastian's station
and Michael on meats.

33:08.846 --> 33:11.581
As far as Michael, I agree.

33:11.582 --> 33:13.182
I did the Wellington because

33:13.183 --> 33:14.484
he said he was ready
with the lamb.

33:14.485 --> 33:16.786
Michael was a disaster.

33:16.787 --> 33:17.787
He's an executive chef.

33:17.788 --> 33:18.821
He's been doing it for a while.

33:18.822 --> 33:19.856
Michael,
you should know better.

33:19.857 --> 33:21.124
What's the matter with you?

33:21.125 --> 33:23.159
I know I up lamb,
but at the same time,

33:23.160 --> 33:25.094
I've cooked thousands
of racks of lamb in my life,

33:25.095 --> 33:28.164
<i>and I have a lot of experience
to bring to the table.</i>

33:28.165 --> 33:31.034
Now with that being said,
I'm going to go with Sebastian.

33:31.035 --> 33:33.703
I mean, you got to know
when to be serious

33:33.704 --> 33:34.771
and put your head down.

33:34.772 --> 33:36.072
You know what I mean?

33:36.073 --> 33:37.874
And, you know, you got to know
when to joke around.

33:37.875 --> 33:40.877
Sebastian really needs
to hit the bricks.

33:40.878 --> 33:42.045
This guy is a clown.

33:42.046 --> 33:44.047
I haven't seen him serious
for a second

33:44.048 --> 33:45.181
since he's been here.

33:45.182 --> 33:46.582
I like to have a good time
at work, man.

33:46.583 --> 33:48.117
I do, too.
I like to make jokes.

33:48.118 --> 33:49.686
I like to have a good time,

33:49.687 --> 33:50.920
but when it's in the kitchen,
man, you've got to crunch.

33:50.921 --> 33:52.789
You came in three times
and then I got kicked out...

33:52.790 --> 33:53.923
Yeah, what the
were you thinking, man?

33:53.924 --> 33:55.491
Coming back in three times?

33:55.492 --> 33:56.759
There was only a second time.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.261
No, you came back a third time.

33:58.262 --> 33:59.896
It's very easy
to point fingers.

33:59.897 --> 34:01.197
Tonight, we all screwed up.

34:01.198 --> 34:03.132
What pisses me off
is I wasn't playing around.

34:03.133 --> 34:05.668
I was actually trying
to put out some good food.

34:05.669 --> 34:07.036
Me, I got to nominate jer.

34:07.037 --> 34:08.538
Not because
he's not a good cook,

34:08.539 --> 34:10.406
but, like, he's not
the strongest guy on the team.

34:10.407 --> 34:12.308
I have to second on Jeremy.

34:12.309 --> 34:13.943
Not 'cause
I don't like you, cuz.

34:13.944 --> 34:15.011
<i>But, like, what
happens tomorrow</i>

34:15.012 --> 34:16.112
<i>when we get in service?</i>

34:16.112 --> 34:17.380
You guys know
you're voting on me

34:17.380 --> 34:18.748
not because I can't cook,

34:18.748 --> 34:20.717
but because I couldn't
repeat back an order?

34:20.717 --> 34:22.185
Chef, can I tell you why
I will vote for you?

34:22.186 --> 34:23.453
Why?

34:23.454 --> 34:25.722
When I see the Greens
literally turning brown...

34:25.723 --> 34:27.190
But I told you I got it.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.658
When you talk to me
in that tone of voice

34:28.659 --> 34:30.460
and with that you got it...

34:30.460 --> 34:32.328
I'm not.
Worry about your side.

34:32.329 --> 34:34.931
Let me do my side, yeah?

34:34.931 --> 34:36.032
'Cause you were yelling at me.

34:36.033 --> 34:37.033
I'm yelling it
right back at you.

34:37.034 --> 34:38.134
I did not yell at you.

34:38.135 --> 34:39.835
Jeremy reminds me
of a young punk

34:39.837 --> 34:43.172
with a lot of mouth
and nothing to back it up.

34:43.172 --> 34:44.607
You're taking me out
because of what I said,

34:44.608 --> 34:45.942
but can I cook?

34:45.943 --> 34:47.810
No, you can't cook.

34:47.811 --> 34:49.344
You ain't doing it good,
playboy.

34:49.346 --> 34:50.713
I'm not doing it good?
You ain't doing it good.

34:50.714 --> 34:52.348
I'm 22.
I got a lead position.

34:52.349 --> 34:53.750
Watch for me. I'm gonna
step on you when I'm bigger.

34:53.751 --> 34:55.217
Watch, when I'm something
and you ain't nothing.

34:55.219 --> 34:56.386
Holmes...

34:56.387 --> 34:57.687
'Cause you stepping on me
real hard, bro.

34:57.688 --> 34:58.755
None of us are
right now.

34:58.756 --> 35:02.091
No, he just stepped on me
real hard!

35:02.092 --> 35:04.560
You don't even know
where the I'm from!

35:09.050 --> 35:11.251
Chef Ramsay
has asked the blue team

35:11.252 --> 35:12.953
for two nominees,

35:12.954 --> 35:16.089
and Michael and Sebastian

35:16.090 --> 35:18.291
have been singled out.

35:18.292 --> 35:20.527
But another candidate
has emerged.

35:20.528 --> 35:22.329
You ain't doing it good,
playboy.

35:22.330 --> 35:23.764
I'm not doing it good?
You ain't doing it good.

35:23.765 --> 35:25.398
You stepping on me
real hard, bro.

35:25.399 --> 35:26.533
None of us are
right now.

35:26.534 --> 35:29.202
No, he just stepped on me
real hard!

35:29.203 --> 35:32.105
You don't even know where
the I'm from!

35:32.106 --> 35:33.540
Imagine how I feel as a chef

35:33.541 --> 35:37.444
knowing I see you doing it wrong
and I don't say nothing.

35:37.445 --> 35:39.412
What do that make me look like?

35:39.413 --> 35:41.248
I know it's you
cooking the dish,

35:41.249 --> 35:42.949
but what the
do that make me look like?

35:42.950 --> 35:45.318
Quit insulting people
before you try their food.

35:45.319 --> 35:46.820
If you feel like that, chef,
then why didn't you say,

35:46.821 --> 35:48.989
"Chef, come and taste it."
I asked, I asked.

35:48.990 --> 35:50.724
I asked everybody
to come try it.

35:50.725 --> 35:52.926
Did he ask any of you?

35:54.896 --> 35:57.230
Zach just threw me
underneath a bus.

35:57.231 --> 36:00.367
But I'm not going
to go down easy.

36:00.368 --> 36:02.836
I'm getting that
stupid restaurant in Vegas,

36:02.837 --> 36:04.805
and I'll be better
than everybody else,

36:04.806 --> 36:06.406
and they'll know it.

36:06.407 --> 36:08.508
How you gonna step on someone's
career like that, dude?

36:08.509 --> 36:10.944
You stepped on
your career.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.548
You just said my career
ain't .

36:14.549 --> 36:16.483
You said,
"Everybody off my station."

36:16.484 --> 36:17.984
You did it to yourself, "B".

36:17.985 --> 36:19.519
The nerve of this guy.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.021
'Cause he knows
what the he's doing.

36:21.022 --> 36:23.757
Clearly you
don't got it. Duh.

36:23.758 --> 36:25.759
You out of here, Holmes.

36:49.083 --> 36:52.953
Men, have you
reached a decision?

36:52.954 --> 36:53.987
Yes, chef.

36:53.988 --> 36:55.155
Did you work as a team?

36:55.156 --> 36:56.456
Yes, chef.

36:56.457 --> 36:58.758
Thank God for that.

36:58.759 --> 37:03.463
Zach, who is the blue team's
first nominee and why?

37:03.464 --> 37:07.033
We have nominated Jeremy,
because we saw something

37:07.034 --> 37:08.668
that wasn't going right
with one of the dishes

37:08.669 --> 37:10.403
that he was doing,
and he refused

37:10.404 --> 37:11.938
to take the criticism,
telling us

37:11.939 --> 37:14.541
to get off his station
and he got it.

37:14.542 --> 37:16.176
The mistake of the cooking
is one thing,

37:16.177 --> 37:19.145
but then the arrogance to not
want it to be corrected

37:19.146 --> 37:20.580
is something totally different.

37:20.581 --> 37:23.783
We can't have
that kind of attitude

37:23.784 --> 37:25.218
in our kitchen going on.

37:25.219 --> 37:27.487
I'm not asking you
to kiss each other's ass,

37:27.488 --> 37:30.757
but when you walk
into that blue kitchen,

37:30.758 --> 37:32.559
you work as a team.

37:34.762 --> 37:38.131
Jeremy, were you arrogant?

37:38.132 --> 37:39.933
<i>Is Zach right?</i>

37:39.934 --> 37:41.301
No, it wasn't
that I was arrogant, chef.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.003
I was frustrated
at the situation, chef,

37:43.004 --> 37:45.005
and I lashed out.

37:47.275 --> 37:49.910
Frustrated and you lashed out?

37:49.911 --> 37:52.345
And whilst
your frustration's building,

37:52.346 --> 37:54.581
you're lashing out

37:54.582 --> 37:57.384
and the customers
aren't getting fed.

37:57.385 --> 38:01.855
Zach, second nominee and why?

38:02.990 --> 38:06.493
Our second nominee is...

38:19.368 --> 38:21.469
After a rough
dinner service where almost

38:21.470 --> 38:24.071
the entire team was kicked
out of the kitchen,

38:24.072 --> 38:25.840
the men have made
a tough decision.

38:25.841 --> 38:28.209
We have nominated Jeremy.

38:29.511 --> 38:31.679
But they are not done yet.

38:31.680 --> 38:34.181
Second nominee and why?

38:34.182 --> 38:37.485
Our second nominee is...

38:40.522 --> 38:42.523
Sebastian.

38:42.524 --> 38:43.524
Why?

38:43.525 --> 38:44.625
Sebastian is a good guy,

38:44.626 --> 38:46.160
but there's a time and
a place to play.

38:46.161 --> 38:48.696
"Zachy-wacky"
in the middle of serv...

38:48.697 --> 38:50.197
like, you know,
we're trying to execute dishes.

38:50.198 --> 38:51.699
We can't have that going on.

38:51.700 --> 38:53.868
If you're not serious now,

38:53.869 --> 38:55.770
I don't got you
getting serious at all.

38:55.771 --> 38:59.040
Jeremy, Sebastian,
step forward.

38:59.041 --> 39:00.875
Let's go.

39:08.650 --> 39:11.352
Sebastian, seriously?

39:11.353 --> 39:13.421
<i>You want to
around in the middle of service?</i>

39:13.422 --> 39:15.222
Why did you come in here?

39:15.223 --> 39:16.724
I love cooking.
This is something I love to do,

39:16.725 --> 39:18.292
and I've been...
I've put in my time.

39:18.293 --> 39:19.860
Today. I know
I dropped the ball.

39:19.861 --> 39:21.162
<i>It's just
sometimes my personality</i>

39:21.163 --> 39:22.463
<i>comes out in the kitchen.</i>

39:22.464 --> 39:24.165
Before I came here,

39:24.166 --> 39:25.433
I knew one
of my biggest problems,

39:25.434 --> 39:27.401
one of my biggest challenges,
is my attitude.

39:27.402 --> 39:29.971
And it's something
I have to correct.

39:32.541 --> 39:34.241
Jeremy.

39:34.242 --> 39:36.644
You're one of the youngest
in this competition.

39:36.645 --> 39:38.546
I thought you were in
way over your head.

39:38.547 --> 39:40.848
Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:40.849 --> 39:42.917
Chef, I've fought for
everything in my life.

39:42.918 --> 39:44.251
I've strived to do better.

39:44.252 --> 39:46.053
I've alwaydone better, chef.

39:46.054 --> 39:49.957
<i>I've succeeded at
almost everything I've tried.</i>

39:49.958 --> 39:51.258
Today I failed.

39:51.259 --> 39:53.427
I don't plan on failing
ever again, chef.

39:53.428 --> 39:56.764
I let my team down,
and I never do that.

39:56.765 --> 39:58.299
Not only did you
let your team down,

39:58.300 --> 40:00.701
you then gave them .

40:00.702 --> 40:02.503
<i>You got yourself in the weeds.</i>

40:02.504 --> 40:04.238
You started giving
to the team.

40:04.239 --> 40:05.639
That was one comment, chef.

40:05.640 --> 40:07.641
<i>One comment?
One comment.</i>

40:09.077 --> 40:10.811
Tough call.

40:15.617 --> 40:18.486
The person
leaving Hell's Kitchen...

40:25.193 --> 40:28.162
Sebastian, give me your jacket.

40:28.163 --> 40:30.498
Keep doing what I said.
Yeah, man.

40:30.499 --> 40:32.833
It's a kitchen,
not a place for comedians.

40:37.806 --> 40:39.840
Good night.

40:45.747 --> 40:48.015
Right now, I'm disappointed
with myself.

40:48.016 --> 40:50.217
I came here thinking that
the challenge

40:50.218 --> 40:51.919
was going to be
to beat the other chefs

40:51.920 --> 40:53.921
<i>and win Hell's Kitchen,</i>

40:53.922 --> 40:57.658
and I found a way
to defeat myself.

40:57.659 --> 41:00.294
Hell's Kitchen, man.
It's no joke.

41:02.931 --> 41:05.800
This is not a game for me.

41:05.801 --> 41:08.035
This is serious business.

41:10.238 --> 41:11.505
Understand?

41:11.506 --> 41:12.540
Yes, chef.

41:12.541 --> 41:14.008
Get out of here.

41:16.378 --> 41:18.712
Now this is a fight,

41:18.713 --> 41:22.283
and I'm not leaving.

41:22.284 --> 41:24.251
I'm staying.

41:24.252 --> 41:25.820
Only bad thing
about winning tonight,

41:25.821 --> 41:27.588
we can't send Gina home.

41:27.589 --> 41:29.990
But if we lose,
she the first sucker

41:29.991 --> 41:31.225
that's getting voted off.

41:31.226 --> 41:32.960
I'm voting with two hands,

41:32.961 --> 41:34.762
and my hoo-ha's
count as two, too,

41:34.763 --> 41:36.764
so that's four hands all day.

41:36.765 --> 41:38.599
I can't keep
carrying these guys.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.468
I can't keep
throwing 'em on my back.

41:40.469 --> 41:42.136
Biggest question on my mind is,

41:42.137 --> 41:44.305
who's the next
I'm getting out of here

41:44.306 --> 41:45.806
'cause the star,

41:45.807 --> 41:49.376
the head chef here
is chef Zach.

41:49.377 --> 41:51.912
Sebastian tried to be funny,

41:51.913 --> 41:54.915
but it was his cooking
that was the joke.

42:01.223 --> 42:03.591
<i>Next time on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:03.592 --> 42:05.626
The women
celebrate their win...

42:05.627 --> 42:06.794
The red team, congratulations.

42:06.795 --> 42:08.395
By having an all-out war.

42:08.396 --> 42:10.297
If you want to argue,
just press the bell, bitch.

42:10.298 --> 42:11.866
Don't call me bitch.

42:11.867 --> 42:13.000
You crazy.

42:13.001 --> 42:14.401
Don't call me crazy.

42:16.138 --> 42:18.906
I said, "bitch,
you crazy and deranged."

42:18.907 --> 42:21.175
The teams
try a bonding exercise.

42:21.176 --> 42:23.844
Backs up against the wall.
Get down, break it up.

42:23.845 --> 42:25.279
Careful.
Stop pushing.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.448
But there's
a shocking departure.

42:27.449 --> 42:30.518
<i>Pack your stuff,
and leave Hell's Kitchen.</i>

42:30.519 --> 42:32.019
And will
an explosive dinner service...

42:32.020 --> 42:34.922
Let's go, then, we're
still serving... communication!

42:34.923 --> 42:36.857
Get some momentum!

42:36.858 --> 42:38.626
Push one chef...

42:38.627 --> 42:39.927
Have you got
a drinking problem?

42:39.928 --> 42:41.128
Too far?

42:41.129 --> 42:42.763
I mean, this is
harder than hard.

42:42.764 --> 42:45.566
All next time
on a truly dangerous...

42:45.567 --> 42:47.735
You may have
to go to the hospital.

42:47.736 --> 42:48.936
Get out! Get out!

42:48.937 --> 42:51.639
All of you,
get the out of here!

42:51.640 --> 42:53.107
Highly dramatic...

42:53.108 --> 42:54.875
People are just
dropping like flies.
