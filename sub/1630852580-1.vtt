00:05.638 --> 00:08.141
Welcome to
Second Chance Retreat...

00:08.208 --> 00:09.409
- Hi!
- Hi!

00:09.509 --> 00:12.512
...a romantic getaway
for single moms and dads

00:12.579 --> 00:13.913
looking for new love.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.916
Don't like, do your little
dumb faces like that.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.086
I already know I'm gonna do the
dumb face and the dumb laugh.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.822
I'm hoping my mom gets love
out of this experience,

00:22.889 --> 00:25.091
especially
for how old she is.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.393
Or not, like --
not like that.

00:26.493 --> 00:28.428
Not -- that came out
really bad.

00:28.528 --> 00:31.364
But you know
there's gotta be a twist.

00:31.431 --> 00:33.233
Right after
that last hug goodbye...

00:33.333 --> 00:34.834
Don't cry.
Don't cry.

00:34.901 --> 00:37.504
...their kids will be
whisked off to a house

00:37.570 --> 00:39.606
just down the road,

00:39.706 --> 00:41.341
where, much to their surprise...

00:41.408 --> 00:42.709
Whoa!

00:42.776 --> 00:44.778
...they'll be secretly working
behind the scenes,

00:44.878 --> 00:47.213
watching their parents'
every move...

00:47.280 --> 00:48.715
Dad!

00:48.782 --> 00:49.883
...playing matchmaker...

00:49.949 --> 00:52.118
- They look really good together.
- Oh!

00:52.218 --> 00:55.622
...and learning<i> way</i> more them
than they ever wanted to.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.057
Oh!

00:57.123 --> 00:58.391
I like the way
that feels.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.527
Oh, my God!

01:01.694 --> 01:03.463
You never know
when you'll find love again...

01:03.563 --> 01:06.800
Feel like a high school girl,
all tingly inside.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.102
...or who will be
the one showing you the way.

01:09.202 --> 01:11.638
- I wouldn't say he has game.
- Oh, wow!

01:11.738 --> 01:12.972
I'm shocked.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.309
So what do you think
the kids are doing?

01:17.444 --> 01:18.812
Welcome to...

01:34.427 --> 01:35.995
All right. Here we go.

01:41.501 --> 01:43.603
It's like
adult summer camp.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.738
It's happening.
It's happening.

01:45.805 --> 01:47.607
You're dropping me off
at man camp.

01:47.674 --> 01:48.975
No, like,
dating boot camp.

01:49.075 --> 01:50.410
No, I like man camp better.

01:50.477 --> 01:52.445
Oh, my God.

01:55.315 --> 01:56.616
What if you like two people?

01:56.683 --> 01:58.852
I've liked two people
at one time before in my life.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.086
Eww!

02:02.822 --> 02:04.023
M.J.: You ready, Mom?

02:04.124 --> 02:05.425
Oh, my God, Myles.
Here we go.

02:05.492 --> 02:07.327
Baby, welcome to the party.

02:12.098 --> 02:13.867
What if you were in this
situation? What would you do?

02:13.967 --> 02:17.103
I don't know, man. I'd have to
be divorced for 11 years first.

02:17.170 --> 02:20.206
I'm nominating my dad, Troy,
for Second Chance Retreat

02:20.306 --> 02:21.708
because he hasn't really been

02:21.808 --> 02:23.943
putting any effort
into his love life lately.

02:24.010 --> 02:25.945
Well, you got to spit some game,
is what you got to do.

02:26.012 --> 02:27.847
You don't think
I have any game?

02:27.947 --> 02:29.215
Oh!

02:29.315 --> 02:30.984
You've got to be more
mysterious with the ladies.

02:31.050 --> 02:32.385
What does that even mean?

02:32.485 --> 02:34.287
Sometimes don't respond
for, like, a few days.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.622
Don't text back
for a few days

02:35.688 --> 02:37.056
and then make them wonder.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.225
It sounds exhausting having
to think about it that hard.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.360
Holy...

02:43.463 --> 02:45.965
Your mama
about to find her man.

02:46.032 --> 02:47.967
He gonna be so fine.

02:55.074 --> 02:56.910
- Oh, my God!
- Look how beautiful.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.578
This is beautiful.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.580
I'm nominating my
beautiful mother, Patricia,

03:00.680 --> 03:03.249
for Second Chance Retreat
because my mom sadly

03:03.349 --> 03:05.685
has been
through other relationships

03:05.752 --> 03:07.554
and they did not go good.

03:07.654 --> 03:08.755
I love you.

03:08.855 --> 03:09.989
It's beautiful.

03:10.056 --> 03:11.591
I've been married
three times,

03:11.691 --> 03:15.195
but technically four because
I married my first one twice.

03:15.261 --> 03:16.396
Be good.

03:16.496 --> 03:17.730
Don't cry. Don't cry.

03:17.830 --> 03:18.765
I won't. I'm calm.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.500
Whitney:
My mom is the kindest,

03:20.567 --> 03:23.436
most genuine person
I've ever met in my life.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.004
But it's time for her
to meet someone

03:25.071 --> 03:27.507
that makes her feel loved
every day and makes her feel

03:27.574 --> 03:30.677
like she's the most
beautiful person in the world.

03:32.445 --> 03:34.747
Trish:
It's so beautiful, y'all!

03:36.749 --> 03:38.785
Wow.
This is gorgeous.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.286
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.754
This beats a trailer.

03:42.689 --> 03:45.058
What?!

03:45.124 --> 03:47.026
That is legit.

03:51.798 --> 03:52.932
I love you.

03:53.032 --> 03:54.701
You have a good time.

03:54.767 --> 03:57.203
Troy:
I would say Noah's general
comment to me over the years

03:57.270 --> 03:58.705
is, "I just want you
to be happy.

03:58.771 --> 04:00.039
If you're happy, I'm happy."

04:00.106 --> 04:01.975
See you, buddy. Later.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.911
He would love to see me
meet somebody fantastic.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.380
And I'm very, very,
very optimistic

04:07.447 --> 04:09.249
that's about ready to happen.

04:09.315 --> 04:12.785
Oh, man.

04:12.885 --> 04:15.054
Hi.

04:15.121 --> 04:16.956
I don't know how I am.
How are you?

04:17.056 --> 04:20.059
I was the first one, so I'm
just out here talking to myself.

04:20.126 --> 04:22.562
I'm Troy.
It's nice to meet you.

04:22.629 --> 04:25.265
My first impression of
Troy is, he is cute.

04:25.331 --> 04:28.101
Thank you
for showing up to Trish's party.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.836
We have drinks,
which this is my second,

04:29.936 --> 04:31.971
but we're
not telling anyone.

04:32.071 --> 04:35.408
Trish and I have a very similar
kind of energy, and I think,

04:35.475 --> 04:36.943
"Okay, this is a good start."

04:37.010 --> 04:38.611
Where are you from?

04:38.678 --> 04:40.413
How about you?

04:40.480 --> 04:41.514
And what do you do there?

04:41.614 --> 04:43.583
I'm a content creator.

04:44.984 --> 04:46.152
Cool.

04:46.252 --> 04:47.620
Troy:
I'm so out of the loop.

04:47.687 --> 04:50.323
I have no idea what you're
talking about, so, yeah.

04:50.423 --> 04:51.958
Super-cool.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.799
Holy shit!

05:00.967 --> 05:05.171
This is the most gorgeous place
I've ever seen in my life.

05:05.271 --> 05:07.373
Is there, like, tequila in here?

05:07.473 --> 05:10.543
Why is this water? Like,
I want some vodka or something.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.545
I'm nervous at this point.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.813
Hello.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.481
How's it going?

05:15.548 --> 05:16.983
What's your name?

05:17.050 --> 05:18.284
Hi, Noah. I'm Whitney.

05:18.351 --> 05:19.719
Yeah, Whitney.
It's nice to meet you.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.054
Nice to meet you, Whitney.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.989
That's super-nice of you
to say. Wow.

05:23.056 --> 05:26.326
You know, here we got this
sweet girl, cute blond hair.

05:26.392 --> 05:27.894
If she looks anything
like her mom,

05:27.994 --> 05:30.563
I think my dad's gonna be doing
all right, honestly.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.065
I think --
I think he'll be okay.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.034
Well, there's some waters
and stuff up there.

05:35.134 --> 05:36.736
Doesn't have tequila
or anything in it.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.205
I'm not allowed to drink.

05:39.305 --> 05:40.406
I'm only 18.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.742
Oh. Just kidding.
Just kidding.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.150
Anyway...

05:51.217 --> 05:52.585
Good luck.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.088
I would say
my dad's very compassionate,

05:55.188 --> 05:57.090
but quiet, more, like...

05:57.190 --> 05:58.224
Reserved.

05:58.324 --> 06:00.193
All righty. Have fun.

06:00.259 --> 06:02.261
I'm nominating my father
for Second Chance Retreat

06:02.362 --> 06:03.896
'cause it would be
a great experience for him

06:03.996 --> 06:05.832
to get out of his comfort zone
and meet some new people

06:05.898 --> 06:07.033
and get out of his shell.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.601
Be safe.

06:09.602 --> 06:11.270
Hello, hello.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.739
Troy:
Welcome to the party.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.041
Well, thank you.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.110
No, I've been single
for four years now.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.378
Okay.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.613
I work for a software company
in Phoenix

06:20.713 --> 06:22.115
in I.T., so...

06:22.215 --> 06:25.118
So...

06:25.218 --> 06:26.953
But, yeah.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.795
Hm.

06:35.895 --> 06:38.364
So now what? Now,
what do we talk about?

06:44.704 --> 06:45.972
Showtime!

06:46.072 --> 06:48.040
Hey!

06:48.107 --> 06:49.308
Let me get myself
together now

06:49.409 --> 06:50.943
'cause I got to look cute
when I walk in.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.211
M.J.: I'm nominating my mom

06:52.278 --> 06:55.081
because sometimes
I question my mother.

06:55.148 --> 06:59.585
There was one brother definitely
a little on the crusty side.

06:59.652 --> 07:01.220
I know it's a little bit
about personality,

07:01.287 --> 07:02.989
but that brother was ugly.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.925
I'm just hoping my mom
will actually find someone

07:05.992 --> 07:08.294
that makes her feel good
for herself.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.299
All right, love you.

07:13.399 --> 07:14.434
Hello.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.668
- Whoa!
- Oh, hi.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.637
Hi.

07:17.737 --> 07:18.938
Yes.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.807
Nice to meet you, Troy.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.308
The time is now.

07:22.408 --> 07:25.111
I'm in the space where
I am ready to receive love.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.079
So I've been divorced
for 14 years.

07:27.146 --> 07:28.414
Wow.

07:28.481 --> 07:31.951
My dating life
is nonexistent.

07:32.018 --> 07:33.252
Okay.

07:33.319 --> 07:35.121
But I was just mainly
focused on my kids.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.456
Yeah.

07:36.522 --> 07:38.424
You know, I don't want
to be the little old lady

07:38.491 --> 07:40.760
sitting at home with my cats.

07:40.827 --> 07:43.362
Listen, I want a man next to me.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.370
Wow. This is almost as nice
as my house back home.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.505
You wish.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.541
My name is Alex,
and I'm 22 years old,

07:55.641 --> 07:57.944
And I'm her father, Scott,
and I'm 50 years young.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.278
Wow,
it looks pretty bad-ass.

07:59.345 --> 08:02.114
I've been single now
for about 10 years.

08:02.181 --> 08:03.616
After two failed marriages,

08:03.683 --> 08:05.885
you know, maybe I'm destined
to grow old alone.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.220
I don't think so.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.155
Oh, good.
I like your optimism.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.157
Love you. You got this.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.126
I want my dad to go into
the Second Chance Retreat

08:14.193 --> 08:17.530
open-minded
and really just give it a shot.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.334
I just have
one piece of dating advice --

08:21.400 --> 08:23.736
Don't talk about "Star Wars."

08:23.836 --> 08:26.839
But I am a Sith Lord.
I am driven by the Dark Force.

08:26.906 --> 08:29.742
Mm-hmm.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.912
And that's how you stay
single forever, folks.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.181
M.J.: What's up, what's up?

08:35.248 --> 08:36.315
Myles.

08:36.382 --> 08:37.750
Hello, Myles.
Myles, too?

08:37.850 --> 08:39.352
Wait.

08:39.418 --> 08:40.686
That's crazy.

08:40.753 --> 08:42.355
- We've got two Mileses.
- Damn, that's wild.

08:42.421 --> 08:43.489
You can just call me M.J.

08:43.556 --> 08:44.824
Hi. I'm Trish.

08:44.891 --> 08:46.092
What's your name?

08:46.192 --> 08:47.326
Scott, Scott.

08:47.393 --> 08:48.761
I'm a hugger,
but I'll shake your hand.

08:48.861 --> 08:49.929
Oh, no,
I'm totally a hugger.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.097
Hi, Scott. How are you?

08:51.197 --> 08:52.231
And your name?

08:52.331 --> 08:53.666
DeNeia.

08:53.733 --> 08:56.536
I mean, I love a tall man,
looking up at him.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.938
He looked good to me.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.040
Am I the only one that woke up
this morning thinking,

09:01.107 --> 09:02.441
"What the F am I doing?"

09:02.542 --> 09:03.709
Yes, yes.

09:03.776 --> 09:05.244
Pretty much all of us.

09:05.344 --> 09:06.612
What's your name?

09:06.712 --> 09:08.180
Nice to meet you.

09:08.247 --> 09:09.248
It's so nice to meet you.

09:09.348 --> 09:10.516
- I'm Noah.
- Hi. Alex.

09:10.583 --> 09:11.884
Nice to meet you.

09:11.951 --> 09:12.919
I can't even lie.

09:13.019 --> 09:14.353
Alex is my type.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.721
I'm into brunettes, for sure.

09:15.788 --> 09:16.923
Are you in a relationship?

09:17.023 --> 09:18.791
I'm very single.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.194
Might be turning that around,
huh?

09:27.600 --> 09:29.635
I'm ready. I'm so ready.
It's been too long.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.405
It's just been
too many wrong choices.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.106
I think
I would agree with you.

09:34.206 --> 09:37.910
I'm nominating my mom because
she needs help finding love.

09:37.977 --> 09:40.112
I maybe could possibly use

09:40.212 --> 09:42.081
a little pushing
in the right direction.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.817
Someone needs to fix her,
and she is not listening to me.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.821
I think that you need
to not focus all the way

09:48.921 --> 09:50.222
into one person.

09:50.289 --> 09:52.558
Don't throw yourself into it,
like you usually do.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.094
My mom
always focuses on one guy

09:55.161 --> 09:57.330
and she just gets
such tunnel vision,

09:57.430 --> 09:59.799
and she just misses
all the red flags.

09:59.899 --> 10:00.833
Oh, wow.

10:04.770 --> 10:05.938
I'm gonna miss you
so much more.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.340
I'm gonna miss you more.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.508
My daughter has been
incredibly protective.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.577
Sometimes she's like,
"I want you with someone.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.846
I just want you with someone
that's good."

10:13.946 --> 10:15.247
Love you.

10:15.314 --> 10:17.316
I think this is
definitely gonna get her

10:17.416 --> 10:18.584
out of her comfort zone

10:18.651 --> 10:20.186
and maybe let her explore
different options

10:20.286 --> 10:23.289
that she would not
necessarily pick for herself.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.490
Hello!

10:24.590 --> 10:27.493
- Hi!
- Hi!

10:27.593 --> 10:29.028
I'm Karen.

10:29.128 --> 10:32.131
Karen walks in,
and I'm thinking, "Yeah,

10:32.198 --> 10:35.835
that's -- that's kind of
my -- kind of my type."

10:35.935 --> 10:37.269
Hi.

10:37.336 --> 10:39.005
Hi, Troy. How are you?

10:39.105 --> 10:40.473
I'm loving the situation.

10:40.539 --> 10:42.008
No, no. I'm Hispanic.

10:42.108 --> 10:43.509
I'm Hispanic.

10:43.609 --> 10:45.845
The men
are extremely attractive,

10:45.945 --> 10:48.047
and I'm like, "Oh, my God."

10:51.317 --> 10:52.551
Whoo!

10:52.652 --> 10:53.953
This is how you want to
to be living, man.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.554
You ready?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.123
I think I'm ready.

10:57.189 --> 10:58.891
My dad,
he has a great personality.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.227
He's a good-looking guy,
but his game,

11:01.327 --> 11:02.895
it can be a little choppy.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.564
Sometimes the conversation
can be a little monologue-y,

11:05.665 --> 11:08.134
and you dive into boring topics
that no one cares about.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.835
Work on the things you need
to work on.

11:09.902 --> 11:11.303
All right, son. I'll see you.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.839
And I think
you'll do a great job.

11:13.906 --> 11:15.007
Hello.

11:15.074 --> 11:16.242
- Hello!
- Hello!

11:16.342 --> 11:17.543
Hey.

11:22.581 --> 11:25.017
DeNeia:
Philip is so handsome.

11:25.084 --> 11:26.252
- Hey, cool.
- Hi.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.687
Oh, my gosh, like,
separate them.

11:27.753 --> 11:30.022
How can somebody like that
still be single?

11:30.089 --> 11:31.257
That is a good question.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.025
Hi. I'm Patricia.
How are you?

11:33.092 --> 11:35.394
- Patricia hug.
- How are you? Huh?

11:35.494 --> 11:36.929
I guess we're hugging, too.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.198
That man, he looked
so fine when he showed up,

11:39.265 --> 11:41.267
I thought he was Jesus.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.568
It was an aura about that man.

11:42.668 --> 11:44.170
I mean,
even if I don't end up with him,

11:44.236 --> 11:45.871
I'm happy for who does.
You know what I mean?

11:45.938 --> 11:47.406
Scott.

11:47.506 --> 11:48.441
We'll hug later.

11:54.914 --> 11:56.615
Oh, hello, parents.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.451
- Hi.
- Hi!

11:58.551 --> 12:00.786
Ooh,
you guys are looking sexy.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.054
So are you.

12:02.121 --> 12:04.790
Oh, it's gonna get spicy
in here.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.025
Hi, Philip Sr.
How are you?

12:06.092 --> 12:07.693
Hey.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.861
I'm really well now.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.463
Want to unbutton
one more button?

12:10.563 --> 12:11.530
Uh-oh.

12:11.597 --> 12:13.632
I'm just...

12:13.733 --> 12:16.068
It just got awkward
very quickly.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.970
Well, I'm your host,
Yvonne Orji,

12:18.070 --> 12:21.240
and welcome
to Second Chance Retreat.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.076
So as you guys know,
you are all here

12:24.143 --> 12:26.145
because your amazing,
wonderful kids

12:26.245 --> 12:29.281
nominated you to come here
for another opportunity

12:29.381 --> 12:31.217
to find true love.

12:31.283 --> 12:33.886
Because apparently whatever
you're doing isn't working.

12:33.953 --> 12:36.255
So date outside
your comfort zone.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.791
You may find new experiences.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.993
You feel like what I'm saying
doesn't make sense to you.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.795
No, it makes total sense.

12:42.895 --> 12:45.431
I'm suddenly looking at Troy
in a whole different way.

12:45.498 --> 12:46.832
I mean, hey.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.635
Love is love.
Love is love.

12:49.735 --> 12:51.237
We have locked away
your phones,

12:51.303 --> 12:54.340
so there is literally
no distractions.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.108
Trish:
This will be worth it.

12:56.175 --> 12:59.111
I give up my phone, one of y'all
better go home with me today.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.647
DeNeia:
It just got real.

13:01.747 --> 13:03.749
I know, girl.
It's been a long time.

13:03.816 --> 13:06.185
Just, we got
double-A batteries upstairs.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.320
It's okay.

13:08.420 --> 13:10.656
All right, so during
your time here at the
Second Chance Retreat,

13:10.756 --> 13:14.426
you will have an opportunity
to go on amazing dates

13:14.493 --> 13:17.296
and perfectly curated
opportunities for you

13:17.363 --> 13:19.665
to mix and mingle
that have been put together

13:19.765 --> 13:23.102
by our team of expert
dating consultants.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.871
You got the whole house.
Enjoy yourselves.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.373
And you know what?

13:27.473 --> 13:29.508
If you guys feel like
you've made a love connection,

13:29.608 --> 13:33.212
there's opportunities
to get you a private room.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.381
And even though
there are seven of you here,

13:35.481 --> 13:38.884
it doesn't necessarily mean
it'll be the same seven

13:38.984 --> 13:41.320
throughout your entire time
at the retreat.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.289
So you guys have something
very exciting

13:43.355 --> 13:46.559
coming up --
your first romantic dinner

13:46.659 --> 13:48.494
that y'all are gonna cook
for each other.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.229
Oh.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.897
Troy, you look nervous.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.632
Are we doing pancakes?
'Cause I'm there.

13:53.699 --> 13:55.901
I've got that locked.

13:56.802 --> 13:58.971
I think -- I think this is
a really good opportunity

13:59.038 --> 14:00.706
for him to,
you know, if not find someone,

14:00.806 --> 14:03.175
at least figure out
how to find someone.

14:03.242 --> 14:04.810
Maybe he could just be
a cat dad,

14:04.877 --> 14:07.413
but I don't like
to picture that.

14:09.381 --> 14:10.516
Hello. Hello.

14:10.583 --> 14:11.650
- Hey.
- How you doing?

14:11.717 --> 14:12.985
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hi!

14:13.052 --> 14:14.420
Welcome to your new home.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.021
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:16.088 --> 14:19.725
You guys are all so awesome
because you've all nominated

14:19.825 --> 14:23.229
your single parent to come
to the Second Chance Retreat

14:23.329 --> 14:25.764
and a chance
at finding love again.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.433
I mean, some of us
are still trying to find love

14:27.533 --> 14:29.668
for the first time,
but it's not about me.

14:29.735 --> 14:32.104
I know you guys were told you
are all gonna be here

14:32.204 --> 14:33.405
to create content

14:33.505 --> 14:34.773
about what it's like
to have a single parent.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.041
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:36.108 --> 14:37.443
Well, if you guys
follow me inside,

14:37.543 --> 14:40.546
I may have a little surprise
for you.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.282
- Oh, my gosh.
- Okay. I'm scared.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.416
Let's go.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.285
Yvonne:
All right, settle in.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.554
- No!
- What?!

14:48.621 --> 14:50.890
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, shit.

14:50.956 --> 14:53.459
I see about
seven monitors on the wall,

14:53.559 --> 14:56.462
which is not something that, you
know, is in every house.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.098
Oh, shit.

14:59.198 --> 15:00.366
to make digital content

15:00.432 --> 15:02.635
about what it's like
to have a single parent.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.370
We gonna have
a lot more fun than that.

15:04.436 --> 15:07.206
No one else knows your parents
better than you do, right?

15:07.273 --> 15:09.875
Yeah.

15:09.942 --> 15:11.443
well, that affects you, too.

15:11.543 --> 15:14.914
So we're gonna include you
in their dating experience.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.383
Oh, my God.

15:17.449 --> 15:19.652
a front-row seat
to what goes down...

15:19.752 --> 15:21.820
Oh, hell no.

15:22.988 --> 15:24.657
That is
the best thing ever.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.292
Oh, shit.

15:26.392 --> 15:30.429
So behind me are seven monitors
where you will be able

15:30.496 --> 15:35.000
to see everything
that goes down at the retreat.

15:35.801 --> 15:38.971
Welcome to
your mission control center

15:39.071 --> 15:41.674
here at the Match Bunker.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.008
My mom is right there.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.110
- Your mom -- What?
- Oh, my God.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.247
Breana:
We're spying on our parents.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.316
We're like the FBI right now.

15:50.416 --> 15:51.850
All right.
So here's the catch.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.320
Your parents think that
their dating experience

15:54.420 --> 15:57.289
is gonna be curated
by a team of dating consultants.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.591
No way. No way.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.694
But guess who the dating
consultants are gonna be.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.928
Us.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.496
We're so experienced.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.432
P.J.: Okay. I actually like
that. He needs help anyway.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.600
Well, here's the thing.
They're not gonna know

16:08.667 --> 16:11.270
you're watching,
so they have no idea

16:11.337 --> 16:14.206
you are here
literally around the corner.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.808
- So welcome.
- Oh, shit. Nice.

16:15.874 --> 16:17.643
You're in on it.

16:17.710 --> 16:20.679
Noah:
I don't know whether to be,
like, you know, happy or, like,

16:20.779 --> 16:24.216
scared to see what is gonna
be going down on those monitors.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.852
I see there are cameras
in bedrooms now.

16:26.952 --> 16:28.887
Oh, hell...

16:28.988 --> 16:31.056
I don't know how to...

16:31.156 --> 16:34.493
If my mom getting to it, I'm
turning this off if we see...

16:36.061 --> 16:37.363
Deal with it, bud.
She grown-grown.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.731
How do you think
you got here?

16:38.831 --> 16:41.400
I'm not watching none
of that nasty stuff.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.470
You all do have
a very special person.

16:44.536 --> 16:47.339
His name is Jimmy.
He is the retreat manager.

16:47.406 --> 16:51.343
And you can call on Jimmy
to help manipulate or mess up

16:51.410 --> 16:53.879
some of these dates. Well, I'm
gonna get out of your hair.

16:53.979 --> 16:57.416
I'm gonna let you guys enjoy
your new digs. Check it out.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.584
- Sounds good.
- Have fun.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.551
Who wants it?

16:59.651 --> 17:01.253
Ooh! Shit.

17:01.353 --> 17:04.723
That must be great.
Holding a koala. Oh, man.

17:04.823 --> 17:05.824
Rrrar!

17:07.659 --> 17:10.662
It's the creepiest-but-coolest
feeling, because now

17:10.729 --> 17:13.532
I have all this power
to help her with her love life.

17:13.599 --> 17:14.767
Whose parents are whose?

17:14.867 --> 17:17.169
- That's my mom.
- Your mom's gorgeous.

17:17.236 --> 17:18.604
I assume that's your dad
at the bottom.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.439
- That<i> is</i> my dad.
- That's my dad above him.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.709
M.J.: If we see one of these
dads getting with our moms...

17:23.776 --> 17:26.045
Yeah.

17:30.682 --> 17:32.785
Is the -- Oh, we got garlic.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.953
Is there black pepper
over there?

17:35.054 --> 17:36.789
And spinach fettuccine.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.857
- Oh, this is the...
- Look. I got it.

17:38.924 --> 17:40.225
Yes! Awesome.

17:40.292 --> 17:42.361
I am attracted
initially to two men.

17:42.428 --> 17:46.432
The first one is Philip.
He walked in. He was confident.

17:46.532 --> 17:48.434
You could tell
he's an elegant man.

17:48.534 --> 17:50.069
And then the second one is Troy.

17:50.135 --> 17:52.471
It looks like we're supposed
to make a spread for it, right?

17:52.571 --> 17:54.273
Okay. Let's do that.

17:54.373 --> 17:55.541
I have no idea what's going on.

17:55.607 --> 17:57.709
I'm very focused
on Karen, actually.

17:57.776 --> 17:59.144
Is there a...

17:59.244 --> 18:01.146
Hand mixer.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.949
Wow!

18:04.049 --> 18:06.618
You just got points.

18:06.718 --> 18:09.955
And I'm thinking, "Man,
she is really, really cool.

18:10.055 --> 18:12.157
I'm open to this, for sure."

18:12.257 --> 18:13.659
That's 1/2 cup.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.161
Two sticks. Wow.
Seems like a lot of butter.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.896
It'll be delicious.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.300
So the tables
have totally turned

18:21.400 --> 18:22.601
because now
we're in charge.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.503
They've always been
in charge of us.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.272
They've always been nosy,
in our business.

18:27.339 --> 18:29.408
All up in the phones.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.844
Y'all are jealous you don't get
to caress the eggplant.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.012
- Oh, my gosh.
- Is that eggplant?

18:34.113 --> 18:36.148
You want to caress one?

18:36.248 --> 18:38.450
Oh, boy.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.185
What's up, man?

18:40.285 --> 18:41.320
I can't...

18:41.420 --> 18:42.488
Your dad's great.

18:42.588 --> 18:43.689
Really?
That's your caressing?

18:43.789 --> 18:45.357
That's why I'm single.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.860
Okay?

18:47.960 --> 18:52.464
Do you prefer for the woman
to plan the date?

18:52.531 --> 18:54.533
I like to plan the first day,
you know, especially

18:54.633 --> 18:57.369
if you do something maybe
a little creative or...

18:57.469 --> 19:00.139
Like?

19:00.205 --> 19:01.507
'Cause if she just met me,
she doesn't want

19:01.607 --> 19:03.008
to get on the back
of the motorcycle.

19:03.108 --> 19:04.209
You want to get on the back
of the motorcycle

19:04.309 --> 19:05.210
on the first date?

19:05.310 --> 19:06.545
- What?!
- Oh, my God.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.213
What the hell
is she talking about?

19:09.982 --> 19:12.718
Oh, my God.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.386
This is the best thing ever.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.989
Our parents are having
a little convo, too.

19:17.055 --> 19:19.158
Yeah, they've -- they've
been talking for a while.

19:19.224 --> 19:20.726
Yeah.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.127
so...

19:22.194 --> 19:23.629
He doing this thing.
I'm proud of him right now.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.531
I'm proud of her, too.
She's not acting too nervous.

19:25.631 --> 19:29.168
Look. They're touching arms.
They're touching arms.

19:29.234 --> 19:32.838
My mom, normally,
when it comes to relationships,

19:32.905 --> 19:36.308
I feel like she goes for men
that act like kids.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.410
But I feel like Philip Sr.,

19:38.510 --> 19:41.413
he shows traits
of my grandfather,

19:41.513 --> 19:42.748
which I really like.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.083
And you look really good
doing that, by the way.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.353
Well, thank you. I try.

19:48.420 --> 19:49.988
They look beautiful.

19:50.055 --> 19:52.491
I mean, these are, like,
some fancy-looking meatballs.

19:52.558 --> 19:53.926
Not really.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.661
Phill's over here.
He's like, "I do not cook."

19:55.727 --> 19:57.729
He's the reserved one.
And then all of a sudden,

19:57.829 --> 20:00.065
Phill makes these
amazing meatballs

20:00.165 --> 20:02.701
that look like they came out of,
like, a magazine.

20:02.768 --> 20:05.604
Oh, wow. Whoa!
Look at these meatballs.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.207
Look at these meatballs.
Whoa!

20:08.273 --> 20:12.110
I think Phill is one of those --
Something's got to be inner self

20:12.211 --> 20:14.880
because he -- he holds back,
but then all of a sudden,

20:14.947 --> 20:18.283
he does amazing at the things
that he says he cannot do.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.585
I'm in the music business.

20:19.685 --> 20:20.919
You're in the music business?

20:21.019 --> 20:22.354
Huh. What does that mean?

20:22.421 --> 20:24.790
What do you do
in the music business?

20:24.890 --> 20:28.126
I'm a music artist manager.
You play music?

20:28.227 --> 20:30.295
I do. Yeah, I play guitar.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.930
I play guitar.

20:32.030 --> 20:35.534
Wow. This guy is, like, getting
sexier as this is going on.

20:35.601 --> 20:37.202
Well, so I used to play
in a country band.

20:37.269 --> 20:38.770
I've just gotten
into country music.

20:38.870 --> 20:40.138
Really?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.873
What are you thinking?
What are you thinking?

20:41.940 --> 20:44.209
Your mom digging this?

20:44.276 --> 20:46.645
This really does look pretty.
You did a great job on that.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.380
I can't believe
he's getting into it so soon.

20:48.447 --> 20:50.148
I mean, it's, like,
the first day,

20:50.249 --> 20:52.284
and he's already, like, looking
at this girl like he loves her.

20:52.384 --> 20:53.952
Here's to second chances.

20:54.052 --> 20:55.487
- Yes!
- Yay!

20:55.587 --> 20:57.322
For sure.

21:00.892 --> 21:02.728
Alex:
I love Noah's personality.

21:02.794 --> 21:03.795
He's so funny.

21:03.895 --> 21:05.831
I like the banter.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.567
I mean,
obviously he's cute.

21:08.634 --> 21:09.901
When he first walked up,
I was like,

21:09.968 --> 21:11.236
"He has to be a model
or something."

21:11.303 --> 21:13.572
Yeah, but he's young.
He just turned 18.

21:13.639 --> 21:16.675
Yeah.

21:16.775 --> 21:20.178
but these, like, 18-year-olds
are so cute.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.513
Oh, Lord.

21:37.195 --> 21:38.530
Are you soft-boiling
the eggs?

21:38.630 --> 21:39.698
I am. Do you want?

21:39.798 --> 21:41.366
- Okay.
- That would be awesome.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.670
Someone did this.

21:44.770 --> 21:46.104
I'm not gonna name
any names.

21:46.171 --> 21:47.873
Who's trying to cook pizza?

22:02.220 --> 22:05.157
The pool looks refreshing.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.561
Jump right in.

22:10.562 --> 22:11.563
Whoo!

22:11.663 --> 22:12.898
So we've got an O.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.299
We need an L.

22:14.366 --> 22:15.701
All right,
so we got three R's.

22:15.801 --> 22:17.469
MILFies and DILFies.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.739
I'm not coming in.
I'll sit right here.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.075
I'm not coming in.
I'm cold, already.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.544
This is like
an awesome vacation

22:25.644 --> 22:26.845
with cool people.

22:26.912 --> 22:28.680
It's like a really long
first date.

22:28.747 --> 22:29.748
Oh, my gosh, right?

22:29.848 --> 22:32.384
Okay.

22:32.484 --> 22:34.653
So what was your favorite thing
that happened yesterday?

22:34.720 --> 22:36.355
Cooking was a lot of fun.

22:36.421 --> 22:37.756
That was my "I like."

22:37.856 --> 22:39.091
Doing that with you was fun.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.759
That was. That was amazing.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.260
Troy:
I'm attracted to Karen.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.596
When I met her, immediately
I had that feeling,

22:44.696 --> 22:47.432
and we had
a good connection last night.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.936
What are
you looking forward to?

22:51.036 --> 22:52.571
Full disclosure --
I think at some point, you

22:52.671 --> 22:54.706
and I might be able
to go on, like, a little "date."

22:54.773 --> 22:56.708
Oh, okay. Okay.

22:56.775 --> 22:57.943
Are you asking me
out on a date?

22:58.043 --> 22:59.177
I mean, if you'd...

22:59.244 --> 23:00.245
If you
would like to go out,

23:00.345 --> 23:01.546
I'd love to take you out.

23:01.613 --> 23:02.948
Karen:
I feel like a high-school girl.

23:03.048 --> 23:06.051
Like, it made me feel,
like, all tingly inside.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.053
I would love
to get to know you more.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.288
So I think that's --

23:10.389 --> 23:11.423
Did you ask?
You haven't asked.

23:11.523 --> 23:13.225
Are you accepting?
Would you...

23:13.291 --> 23:15.961
Could we please go on a proper
date sometime while we're here?

23:16.061 --> 23:17.896
I accept.

23:22.801 --> 23:24.403
This pool is amazing.

23:27.439 --> 23:28.407
Did you get any coffee?

23:28.473 --> 23:30.776
No.

23:30.876 --> 23:32.144
So your tattoo, yeah.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.478
What is this on your...

23:33.578 --> 23:34.913
...arm there?

23:34.980 --> 23:37.048
Boobies.
I like that. I like boobies.

23:37.115 --> 23:38.717
It's -- It's...

23:38.784 --> 23:39.985
I do see boobies there.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.486
Because I was
trying to figure it out,

23:41.586 --> 23:43.255
because, you know...

23:43.321 --> 23:45.957
Oh, you weren't thinking I have,
like, a big penis right there.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.629
- Okay. But...
- Yeah.

23:50.729 --> 23:53.165
Apparently, I'm getting
some touch-up work done

23:53.265 --> 23:55.567
on my penis.

23:56.968 --> 23:59.304
Apparently DeNeia thought
I had a penis tattoo.

23:59.404 --> 24:02.674
It is a woman etched
in a knife blade.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.109
I don't know
what kind of penises

24:04.176 --> 24:06.978
she's been seeing in her life,
but

24:07.078 --> 24:08.313
I saw the tip,
and I'm thinking, "Oh."

24:08.413 --> 24:09.748
I think your brain
was already there.

24:09.815 --> 24:12.984
You were just looking
for an excuse to let it out.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.527
Oh, yeah!

24:26.965 --> 24:29.134
My dad seems pretty enamored
with your mom.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.702
Yeah.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.205
They look good together.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.208
My dad finds
Bre's mom attractive,

24:36.308 --> 24:38.009
and I kind of find her
attractive myself.

24:38.109 --> 24:39.377
If I were my dad's age,

24:39.478 --> 24:41.213
that would definitely be
my cup of tea.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.514
Um...

24:42.614 --> 24:44.516
don't tell Bre that, though.

24:44.616 --> 24:47.385
My dad's kind of that guy
who moves a little too fast.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.654
Yeah, I get it. My mom
gets tunnel vision, too.

24:49.721 --> 24:50.822
Oh, yeah?

24:50.889 --> 24:52.390
Breana:
If I'm being quite honest,

24:52.491 --> 24:55.560
I have mixed feelings
about my mom's current situation

24:55.660 --> 24:57.496
because I like Troy,

24:57.562 --> 25:02.634
but my mom always settles for
the first person that she sees.

25:02.701 --> 25:04.803
And it's time for her
to really open her horizons

25:04.870 --> 25:07.739
and give herself a chance
for other people.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.040
I think we should just,
you know,

25:09.140 --> 25:11.176
keep them talking instead of,
you know,

25:11.243 --> 25:12.911
the whole physical aspect
of it.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.479
Yeah.

25:14.546 --> 25:15.981
because
no one wants to be that guy.

25:16.047 --> 25:17.516
No one wants to be
a cock block, but...

25:17.582 --> 25:19.084
But we're doing this --
We're doing this

25:19.184 --> 25:20.852
for the better
of our parents.

25:20.919 --> 25:22.921
Exactly.
This is a real relationship,

25:23.021 --> 25:25.924
not just a little hookup
for them.

25:26.024 --> 25:27.893
Yeah, dude. Ha.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.929
Oh, that was close.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.037
All right, well,
your parents are going on

25:39.104 --> 25:41.706
their first dates,
uh, tonight.

25:41.773 --> 25:43.708
Oh.

25:43.775 --> 25:46.444
And you guys actually
get to decide...

25:46.545 --> 25:48.847
Oh, shit.

25:48.914 --> 25:52.384
There are three moms,
and there are four dads,

25:52.450 --> 25:56.454
so everyone but one dad
is gonna get paired up.

25:57.422 --> 25:59.291
All right.
Head on up to the war room.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.127
So you guys have 10 minutes
to deliberate.

26:06.197 --> 26:09.234
Being in this situation
as, like, a dating counselor

26:09.301 --> 26:11.102
for my father
is kind of crazy.

26:11.202 --> 26:13.438
I feel like if he knew
I was his dating counselor,

26:13.538 --> 26:16.141
he would definitely not listen
to any of my advice.

26:16.241 --> 26:17.442
Good thing he doesn't know.

26:17.542 --> 26:19.578
I don't know.
I feel like P.J.'s father

26:19.644 --> 26:21.446
would be, like, a good choice
for my mother.

26:21.546 --> 26:24.249
But what your mom was
saying about family, I was like,

26:24.316 --> 26:28.553
"Oh, my gosh, I think my dad
would, like, love that insight."

26:28.620 --> 26:32.657
With Scott and my mom, I don't
want them to go on a date.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.492
I guess they have
a little bit of chemistry,

26:34.593 --> 26:37.329
but I just don't think
that they would work out.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.130
What if we did
something really random, though,

26:39.230 --> 26:41.166
and just pick --
yeah, just do total random,

26:41.266 --> 26:43.568
like, to be, like -- to mess
with it and just have them,

26:43.635 --> 26:45.904
like, get out of their
comfort zone with somebody else?

26:45.971 --> 26:47.238
I don't think
we should put them with

26:47.305 --> 26:49.107
who they've talked to most
in the house.

26:49.174 --> 26:52.177
I think we need to put them with
who they<i> haven't</i> talked to

26:52.277 --> 26:55.080
so they can get to know that
person in a different setting.

26:55.146 --> 26:57.182
And I feel like
it's a good strategy

26:57.282 --> 27:00.251
to get them out of their comfort
zone and choose new people.

27:00.318 --> 27:05.457
I'm nervous that such
a big decision is in our hands,

27:05.523 --> 27:06.958
but it's kind of fun.

27:07.025 --> 27:08.526
Maybe they will have chemistry.
Maybe they won't,

27:08.627 --> 27:10.528
but you can figure
that out early.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.631
I think we should just
lock it down like this
and see how it plays out.

27:12.697 --> 27:14.132
I think it's all right.

27:14.199 --> 27:15.700
Have we reached
a conclusion?

27:15.800 --> 27:17.202
I think we've got it.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.037
I think so.

27:24.676 --> 27:25.977
Yvonne:
So how was the first night?

27:26.044 --> 27:27.545
Dinner was spectacular.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.214
That was the highlight
of the night.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.482
What did you make?

27:30.548 --> 27:32.951
Not much,
but everybody else did great.

27:33.018 --> 27:35.186
We had the entree,
so I had a threesome last night.

27:35.286 --> 27:37.522
My first time ever.
It was great.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.192
Are we still talking
about food?

27:41.292 --> 27:42.727
No, food, food! Food.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.562
Like, we had --
Three of us did an entree.

27:44.663 --> 27:45.897
You know what you said.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.732
Okay, you want to take
over the conversation?

27:47.832 --> 27:50.635
Oh, absolutely not.
I can't wait...

27:52.037 --> 27:54.172
Mom's embarrassed.
I know she is. Right now.

27:54.239 --> 27:58.376
Everyone will have a date
tonight, except for one guy.

27:58.476 --> 28:01.813
As you know, the numbers
are a little imbalanced.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.348
All the dads are
looking nervous right now.

28:03.415 --> 28:04.916
They're stressing.
They're stressing.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.252
Like, they're really stressing.

28:07.352 --> 28:11.089
So in my hands,
I have three envelopes

28:11.189 --> 28:13.591
who the dating consultants
have,

28:13.692 --> 28:16.728
you know, figured out what
might be a good first pairing.

28:16.828 --> 28:18.663
- The dating consultants.
- The dating consultants.

28:18.730 --> 28:21.166
Little do they know.

28:21.232 --> 28:24.202
So the first pairing.
DeNeia?

28:24.269 --> 28:26.771
Yes.

28:26.871 --> 28:27.772
Philip.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.341
Oh! Well, hello, Philip.

28:31.910 --> 28:34.279
Oh, yeah, I think my dad's --
My dad will be happy about that.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.847
Yvonne:
Are you excited about that?

28:35.914 --> 28:39.751
Tonight is a sip and paint night
with you and Philip.

28:39.851 --> 28:41.186
So you guys will have
a glass of wine

28:41.252 --> 28:43.722
while you guys paint portraits
of one another.

28:43.788 --> 28:45.423
M.J.: Even though it's early,
I feel like my mom

28:45.523 --> 28:47.125
is kind of opening up
a little bit

28:47.225 --> 28:49.194
and being kind of goofy
with Philip Sr.

28:49.260 --> 28:51.096
I think the date will show
a little bit more

28:51.196 --> 28:54.132
than what I saw in the kitchen.
I'm definitely excited

28:54.232 --> 28:57.402
to see how this connection
goes with my mom and Philip.

28:57.469 --> 28:58.536
Patricia, are you ready?

28:58.603 --> 28:59.738
I'm ready, girl.
I'm ready.

28:59.804 --> 29:01.206
Patricia says,
"I landed ready."

29:01.272 --> 29:03.408
Let me have it. Let me have it.
Which one is it?

29:03.475 --> 29:04.375
Phill.

29:04.442 --> 29:06.578
Phill.
Good, Phill. Yeah.

29:06.644 --> 29:09.881
You two are gonna have
some steamy fun in the hot tub.

29:09.948 --> 29:11.883
Wow. Okay.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.485
Miles:
I feel like Trish and my dad

29:13.585 --> 29:15.386
have, like,
pretty opposite personalities,

29:15.453 --> 29:17.122
so it'll definitely be
interesting

29:17.222 --> 29:18.590
to see how that goes.

29:18.656 --> 29:19.991
Karen.

29:20.091 --> 29:21.793
Are you ready to find out
who you're going on a date with?

29:21.893 --> 29:24.462
Well, it's gonna be
Scott or Troy.

29:26.931 --> 29:30.502
Karen, I hope you enjoy
your lovely date...

29:35.006 --> 29:36.007
...with Scott.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.509
Okay.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.345
Oh, wait a minute.
That means I'm the odd man out.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.180
I just realized how happy
I was for you there,

29:42.280 --> 29:43.481
just for a second.

29:43.581 --> 29:45.083
Troy:
I thought it was gonna be me.

29:45.150 --> 29:47.185
I know there's obviously
competition.

29:47.285 --> 29:50.121
And so I'll be curious
to see how that goes.

29:50.188 --> 29:51.489
Oh!

29:51.589 --> 29:53.491
- Ah, damn.
- Troy.

29:53.591 --> 29:55.960
I didn't want to step
on anyone's toes,

29:56.027 --> 29:57.595
but my dad's a catch.

29:57.662 --> 30:00.532
He could not be the one
sitting there alone.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.933
Sorry, Troy.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.635
My mom feels so awkward
right now. I can tell.

30:03.701 --> 30:06.771
It's so awkward over there.
The atmosphere.

30:06.838 --> 30:10.208
Karen:
It's okay, because I want to
know Scott on a personal level

30:10.308 --> 30:12.544
and see what's gonna happen
from there.

30:12.644 --> 30:16.314
So tonight you guys
will be playing a game of pool.

30:16.381 --> 30:17.982
Oh.

30:18.049 --> 30:22.821
that means that
tonight you will be dateless.

30:22.887 --> 30:26.324
Noah:
I'm not happy about the fact
that my dad's gonna be alone.

30:26.391 --> 30:27.692
But I also can't deny the fact

30:27.792 --> 30:29.460
that they need to explore
all their options,

30:29.527 --> 30:31.896
and that's what
this whole thing's about.

30:31.996 --> 30:33.832
I guess I take one
for the team tonight.

30:33.898 --> 30:35.066
Good luck, gentlemen.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.569
My wheels
are turning a little bit, like,

30:37.669 --> 30:39.037
"How was this decided?"

30:39.137 --> 30:40.638
It's a kick in the gut.

30:40.705 --> 30:42.740
Well, I will leave you
all to enjoy your dates.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.410
I will catch up with you
tomorrow to see how things went.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.744
Bye.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.146
Karen,
I'll pick you up at...

30:48.213 --> 30:49.214
At my door, please.

30:49.314 --> 30:50.682
Woman:
Oh, there you go.

30:57.989 --> 30:59.824
Trish:
That looks amazing on you.

30:59.891 --> 31:03.161
He's gonna be like, "DeNeia!"
Very sexy.

31:07.098 --> 31:08.900
I don't have a problem
with, like, Scott at all.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.535
I just feel like my mom...

31:10.602 --> 31:12.103
I just know
she wants the full package,

31:12.203 --> 31:13.838
and I feel like it's Philip
for her.

31:13.905 --> 31:15.874
Yeah, yeah.

31:15.940 --> 31:18.009
Just, like, adjusted, like...

31:22.914 --> 31:25.717
- Why?
- Sound the alarm!

31:27.785 --> 31:29.454
- Yo, I'm confused.
- "Meddle Time."

31:29.554 --> 31:31.256
What does
"Meddle Time" mean?

31:31.356 --> 31:32.624
Okay, here we go.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.059
"Tonight you will get
the opportunity to meddle

31:35.126 --> 31:36.227
in your parents' dates."

31:36.294 --> 31:37.462
Oh, my God.

31:37.562 --> 31:41.132
Oh. "However, you must
sacrifice your bed tonight

31:41.232 --> 31:43.735
and sleep on the floor
if you want to meddle"

31:43.801 --> 31:44.969
I don't mind
sleeping on the floor.

31:45.069 --> 31:47.138
I sleep like a rock.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.473
But what does "meddle" mean?

31:48.573 --> 31:50.642
Are we winning a medal?
Like...

31:52.210 --> 31:53.912
Noah:
No, no. Like -- Like...

31:53.978 --> 31:55.146
Bro, I'm confused.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.814
Like, mess with their date
or, like...

31:56.915 --> 31:58.383
Bro, it's just
a different "metal."

31:58.449 --> 32:01.052
So it means "mess with"?

32:01.119 --> 32:03.288
- Oh.
- Dude.

32:03.388 --> 32:05.323
I don't know.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.425
I mean, we got to mess with them
at some point.

32:07.492 --> 32:08.660
I think
we should just say yes.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.395
Y'all want to take it
for the team?

32:10.461 --> 32:12.230
- I'll take one for the team.
- You know what? I guess I'm in.

32:12.297 --> 32:13.998
- Yeah.
- Good job, Miles.

32:14.098 --> 32:15.500
Woman:
"Do you wish to proceed?"

32:15.600 --> 32:18.803
Wait. Do we press the screen,
or will I look stupid?

32:20.438 --> 32:21.639
Oh.

32:21.739 --> 32:23.341
Let's try this.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.642
I don't think so, man.

32:24.742 --> 32:26.144
I'm so proud.
I'm so proud.

32:26.244 --> 32:29.280
He's gonna look stupid.

32:33.084 --> 32:35.186
Yes, I wish to proceed.

32:35.286 --> 32:37.488
I mean,
we have to test it out.

32:41.926 --> 32:43.027
- Oh!
- Oh!

32:43.127 --> 32:44.462
She coming down
in the red dress?

32:44.529 --> 32:46.965
Look at my dad. Go ahead, Pop.
Looking clean.

32:47.031 --> 32:48.199
Where should I sit?

32:48.299 --> 32:49.634
Well,
why don't you take --

32:49.701 --> 32:50.868
You want to take the shade?

32:50.969 --> 32:52.870
I am very nervous, actually.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.372
Extremely nervous.

32:54.472 --> 32:57.108
Because I have not dated
in such a long time.

32:57.175 --> 32:59.877
How about this?
How about to a lovely evening?

32:59.978 --> 33:01.179
Yes.

33:01.279 --> 33:03.214
- Oh.
- Oh.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.449
He's precious.

33:04.515 --> 33:05.717
Does this look like you?

33:07.318 --> 33:09.187
I can see it. I see it already.

33:09.287 --> 33:10.488
You got the head shape.

33:10.555 --> 33:12.123
I think
you're doing phenomenal...

33:12.190 --> 33:16.027
Thank you.

33:20.064 --> 33:21.499
What the hell is that?

33:21.566 --> 33:22.900
Uh-oh. Wait a minute now.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.369
Well, I mean
I mean...

33:26.170 --> 33:29.007
He's gonna get so awkward
over this. I already know.

33:29.073 --> 33:30.908
I work for...

33:31.009 --> 33:34.712
in I.T. for healthcare
organization.

33:34.812 --> 33:39.917
And we have over
3,000 software applications

33:40.018 --> 33:42.153
that we use
for our business.

33:42.220 --> 33:44.088
He starting the monologue.
And it's 'cause he's nervous.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.090
Like, when he gets
nervous, he just starts
running his mouth.

33:46.190 --> 33:49.727
My team's responsible
for designing hardware solutions

33:49.827 --> 33:51.863
so that the hardware
is utilized.

33:51.929 --> 33:54.232
A ton of servers out there
for software

33:54.332 --> 33:56.601
that's just gonna use
one little piece of...

33:56.701 --> 33:59.270
We have should have five.
We work with our vendors

33:59.370 --> 34:02.373
to get hardware solutions
implemented in the data center.

34:02.440 --> 34:04.409
Come on, Pop. You got
to change the subject.

34:04.509 --> 34:08.513
P.J.: My dad's dating skills
are worse than I thought.

34:08.579 --> 34:11.349
Sometimes I wonder,
like, how I even got here.

34:14.018 --> 34:16.120
- I called it.
- We had to switch it up.

34:16.220 --> 34:17.455
It was about time.

34:17.555 --> 34:20.792
So option A -- "Send
in a sexy s'mores kit."

34:20.892 --> 34:24.796
Or Option B -- "Send in a trick
bottle to pour some wine

34:24.896 --> 34:27.465
on this moment." He need more.
He needs more wine.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.800
Sexy s'mores kit.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.735
I just think A will
spice it up a little bit.

34:30.802 --> 34:32.970
Yeah.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.806
All right.
Option A. Here it is.

34:34.906 --> 34:37.375
Commence meddling.

34:37.442 --> 34:39.744
Send in
the sexy s'mores.

34:39.811 --> 34:40.878
We have 35,000 servers

34:40.945 --> 34:42.313
spread across
those data centers.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.482
M.J.: Uh-oh. Here we go.
Here we go.

34:44.582 --> 34:45.917
- Wait.
- Here it comes.

34:45.983 --> 34:47.919
...the hardware
is utilized efficiently.

34:47.985 --> 34:49.387
Oh. Just who
we've been looking for.

34:49.454 --> 34:51.956
Hi, guys.
Yeah, our dating consultants

34:52.056 --> 34:55.126
asked me to bring this to you as
a special treat for your date.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.161
Enjoy.

34:57.261 --> 35:00.665
Yeah, I just want them
to get more, you know, comfy.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.467
And there's blindfolds?

35:02.567 --> 35:04.335
Yeah,
that makes it fun, right?

35:05.903 --> 35:07.505
And we're gonna see
if we can go --

35:07.605 --> 35:08.773
we can find mouths.

35:10.241 --> 35:12.844
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.012
Okay, yeah,
you got my mouth there?

35:15.113 --> 35:16.013
What you got?

35:16.114 --> 35:18.349
Oh, my God.

35:18.449 --> 35:19.917
There we go.
Okay, now I can --

35:19.984 --> 35:21.352
Wait.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.187
Okay, there you go.

35:25.022 --> 35:27.125
Alex:
Oh, this is so sexy.

35:27.191 --> 35:28.426
This was a good choice.
This is a good choice.

35:28.493 --> 35:30.294
Actually this is better.

35:30.361 --> 35:32.096
P.J.:
You know, I was happy to see
that they seemed to be bonding

35:32.163 --> 35:33.764
a little bit. You know, still,
we got some work to do,

35:33.831 --> 35:35.700
but it was definitely
a positive experience for him.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.001
He's getting better.

35:37.101 --> 35:39.203
I had a good time.
Such a good time with you.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.771
You're a special person.

35:40.838 --> 35:42.874
Thank you.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.443
Can I give you a kiss
on the cheek?

35:47.545 --> 35:49.547
Uh-oh.

35:52.383 --> 35:54.685
I'll take
a kiss on the cheek.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.822
- Oh!
- Oh!

35:57.889 --> 35:59.557
There you go, Pop.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.959
DeNeia:
Philip is a gentleman.

36:02.026 --> 36:03.661
It was okay.
It was a first date.

36:03.728 --> 36:04.896
I welcomed the kiss.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.398
I'm gonna cry.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.667
I feel like a proud dad
right now.

36:09.734 --> 36:12.069
Philip Sr.: I think the date
went really good,

36:12.170 --> 36:15.039
and I hope we have
lots of opportunities to know

36:15.139 --> 36:18.543
each other even more and much
better as we go forward.

36:26.050 --> 36:28.920
Hey. How are you?

36:29.020 --> 36:31.589
You are gorgeous.

36:31.689 --> 36:34.058
I put my mom on a date
with Scott

36:34.158 --> 36:38.095
because he seems very goofy
and can make her laugh a lot.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.098
But, also, I saw her really
hitting it off with Troy.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.936
So I figured maybe not putting
her with the first guy

36:45.036 --> 36:47.939
could help her
not follow her bad habits.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.775
Do you have experience
shooting pool?

36:50.875 --> 36:52.610
You'll have to find out.

36:53.844 --> 36:56.948
So the whole idea is obviously
to hit the white ball

36:57.048 --> 36:58.749
into the colored balls...

36:58.849 --> 36:59.951
into the hole.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.385
Is he mansplaining?

37:01.452 --> 37:03.387
Pool.

37:03.454 --> 37:04.622
Oh.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.792
Good shot.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.296
- Oh, you're killing me.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.632
I'm trying to win.
I can't help it.

37:14.732 --> 37:17.268
Ooh!

37:17.368 --> 37:21.205
He does not let people win.
Even a beautiful woman.

37:22.406 --> 37:25.476
He's a little competitive,
which is like,

37:25.576 --> 37:29.981
"Whoa, okay." I'm not used to
that from a man towards me.

37:31.449 --> 37:33.050
Mm...

37:33.117 --> 37:36.988
I'd say good shot, but honesty
is very important to me.

37:38.990 --> 37:42.293
Oh, finally.
I'm so excited right now.

37:42.393 --> 37:44.161
- "Meddle Time."
- I'm so excited.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.398
Option A -- "Make this
moment one to remember

37:47.465 --> 37:50.635
by setting up your parents'
first slow dance."

37:50.735 --> 37:54.438
"Or send your parents into
a state of quiet meditation

37:54.505 --> 37:56.007
to clear their minds.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.508
No talking allowed."

37:57.608 --> 37:59.243
Like, my mom likes to meditate,
but I don't think

37:59.310 --> 38:00.911
in the middle of a date,
just, like, they're just,

38:00.978 --> 38:03.180
like, sitting there
staring at each other.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.818
So maybe option A.

38:07.918 --> 38:09.987
Yeah.

38:11.656 --> 38:14.759
- Oh, that was for Jose.
- Money, money.

38:14.825 --> 38:16.027
You're hustling me.

38:17.662 --> 38:19.530
Ooh!

38:19.630 --> 38:21.165
What is that sound?

38:21.265 --> 38:22.967
- Whoo!
- Oh!

38:23.034 --> 38:24.268
There it is.

38:24.335 --> 38:26.871
What's funny is that my dad
says the one thing

38:26.971 --> 38:29.340
he's, like,
awful at is dancing.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.608
Oh.

38:30.675 --> 38:33.144
Alex:
I'm so excited for my dad

38:33.210 --> 38:35.980
because this is totally out
of his comfort zone.

38:36.047 --> 38:39.150
Oh, he got to wipe the sweat off
the palms. Yep, yep.

38:41.786 --> 38:43.287
Okay. I'm awful at it.

38:43.354 --> 38:45.022
So please take the lead
and help me here.

38:45.122 --> 38:47.224
I'm not gonna take the lead.
You need to take the lead.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.627
And I'm sure
you're amazing at.

38:49.694 --> 38:53.497
I was not gonna have that
because I like my men to lead.

38:53.564 --> 38:56.133
See? I'm just doing this.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.737
This is so bad.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.173
How am I doing?

39:02.239 --> 39:03.641
You're just being nice.

39:03.708 --> 39:06.243
Yeah, she has to say that.
She has to say that.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.578
Like, yeah,
he's really squeezing.

39:07.678 --> 39:08.846
You got to, like,
just let it, like, rest.

39:08.913 --> 39:10.247
Like, her hand
can't even relax.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.582
Yeah,
she can't even wrap hers.

39:11.682 --> 39:12.850
He's like this.

39:12.917 --> 39:14.318
He's got to
to just, like, let it be.

39:14.385 --> 39:16.053
Alex:
He needs to loosen up.

39:16.153 --> 39:18.022
You know, I can do that
a little bit.

39:18.089 --> 39:19.990
A little shift in the hips.

39:20.057 --> 39:22.693
He's not the greatest
dancer, but it's okay.

39:22.760 --> 39:27.098
He did step up and he did lead.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.766
Whoo!

39:28.866 --> 39:31.001
That was cute.

39:31.068 --> 39:33.671
On that note, I'm taking
a slug of beer.

39:35.439 --> 39:38.175
My mom likes to kind of
go for the nerdier guys,

39:38.242 --> 39:41.612
and Scott
could make her laugh a lot.

39:41.712 --> 39:44.115
And it seems like they're having
a good time already.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.117
So I think this
could be a good match.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.219
You know,
it's awesome,

39:48.285 --> 39:50.621
you know, getting to hang out.

39:50.721 --> 39:53.624
The date with Karen and
Scott, I don't really like it

39:53.724 --> 39:55.860
because I think
it's hurting my dad's chances.

39:55.926 --> 39:57.962
Troy's like,
"I hear you, assholes!"

39:59.864 --> 40:01.532
It's been difficult.

40:01.599 --> 40:03.434
Aah!
I'm gonna die.

40:03.534 --> 40:06.137
I can hear stuff going on,
and I'm writing in my journal

40:06.237 --> 40:09.607
to try to turn it into
really a positive, honestly.

40:09.707 --> 40:12.410
But I'm just so frustrated
with the situation.

40:20.751 --> 40:22.987
Here they come.
Oh, they're in their robes.

40:23.087 --> 40:26.323
Oh, I see you, Mama.
I see you, girl.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.794
Oh, we got fruit.
And we got us a drink.

40:29.894 --> 40:32.163
So shall we?

40:32.263 --> 40:33.964
Should we get in?

40:34.064 --> 40:35.065
All right. I'm ready.

40:36.934 --> 40:39.003
Seeing my mom on this
date with Phill right now

40:39.103 --> 40:41.772
has me a little bit nervous,
a little bit scared

40:41.839 --> 40:43.340
because I just don't think
a hot tub

40:43.441 --> 40:46.977
would be the first date,
like, she would want to go on.

40:47.077 --> 40:47.945
Whoa!

40:48.012 --> 40:49.346
Oh.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.614
Beautiful.

40:50.681 --> 40:53.784
Okay.

40:53.851 --> 40:56.854
My dad is a pretty quiet
and reserved guy

40:56.954 --> 40:59.290
and I've never seen him
in a situation like this,

40:59.356 --> 41:03.027
so I'm curious to see
how this is gonna go.

41:06.197 --> 41:08.799
Um, so we have refreshments.

41:08.866 --> 41:11.535
Phill seems so reserved.

41:11.635 --> 41:13.871
But I think that there is, like,
something underneath him.

41:13.971 --> 41:16.540
So tonight I just want
to get him out of his shell.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.209
Want to do a cheers?

41:18.309 --> 41:20.845
To tonight's date?

41:20.945 --> 41:22.213
here tonight.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.681
Getting to know a little bit
more about each other.

41:23.781 --> 41:25.549
Yes, I love that.

41:25.649 --> 41:26.851
Cheers.

41:26.951 --> 41:28.385
Bottoms up.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.654
I don't mind a woman
who's a little aggressive,

41:30.721 --> 41:31.989
tells me what she wants

41:32.056 --> 41:33.657
so I'm not trying
to figure it out.

41:33.724 --> 41:35.893
I'm not gonna try
to do anything like,

41:35.993 --> 41:40.064
"Hey, look at me,"
or do something ridiculous, no.

41:46.904 --> 41:49.373
Oh, shit.
I lost cucumber.

41:49.473 --> 41:50.908
That's okay.

41:51.008 --> 41:53.010
I feel like the environment
just isn't working right now.

41:53.077 --> 41:55.079
Yeah.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.316
There you go, guys.

41:59.383 --> 42:01.685
Option A --
"Send in a massage kit

42:01.752 --> 42:04.355
complete with oils,
a scalp massager,

42:04.421 --> 42:08.759
and the tools your parents need
for an instant romance."

42:08.859 --> 42:10.027
Or we can place a giant,

42:10.094 --> 42:12.096
very loud fan
in the middle of the date.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.497
We're definitely
gonna put them

42:13.564 --> 42:15.099
out of their comfort zone
if we click A.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.500
They need it,
they need it.

42:16.567 --> 42:17.668
Agreed on A, right?

42:17.735 --> 42:19.937
We are deciding
with option A.

42:20.037 --> 42:21.605
Let's see how they feel
about this.

42:21.705 --> 42:26.544
- Oh, here he comes. Oh.
- Jimmy!

42:26.610 --> 42:27.945
Hey, guys.

42:28.045 --> 42:30.948
I really hate to
interrupt the energy here.

42:31.048 --> 42:32.516
Okay.

42:32.583 --> 42:34.952
The dating consultants
put together this massage kit

42:35.052 --> 42:37.788
for you guys to explore.

42:37.888 --> 42:38.956
My mom's...

42:39.056 --> 42:41.859
My mom is like,
"What the hell?"

42:42.760 --> 42:44.028
Oh, we're giving ourselves it?

42:44.094 --> 42:45.763
Jimmy:
Yeah, you massage each other.

42:49.033 --> 42:50.901
Are you cringing?

42:50.968 --> 42:53.470
I know that's gonna be so out
of my dad's comfort zone.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.739
A lavender massage oil.

42:55.806 --> 42:56.974
What about that?

42:57.074 --> 43:00.144
So how about if I give you
a little massage?

43:00.244 --> 43:01.378
- Oh!
- Oh!

43:01.445 --> 43:03.380
- Phill!
- Yeah, Phill! Yeah, Phill!

43:03.447 --> 43:05.082
- Let's go.
- That's what I'm talking about.

43:05.149 --> 43:06.584
I'm not gonna say no.

43:06.650 --> 43:08.552
Yeah, Phill,
try something new.

43:08.619 --> 43:10.654
I don't want to to try
to get it all in your hair.

43:10.754 --> 43:13.257
Oh, it's already messed up.
Get it all up in there, Phill.

43:13.324 --> 43:15.259
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

43:15.326 --> 43:18.262
Get it started, Phill.
You're my hero, Phill.

43:18.329 --> 43:20.631
Is this relaxing?

43:20.731 --> 43:22.266
We also have some berries there.

43:22.333 --> 43:24.134
Why don't you help yourself
to some fruit?

43:24.234 --> 43:26.003
You got game, Phill.
You got game.

43:26.103 --> 43:27.171
Yeah, Phill!

43:27.271 --> 43:29.173
I did not see this coming.
I'm shocked.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.342
Okay.

43:31.442 --> 43:33.777
I'll take that, also.

43:33.844 --> 43:36.180
I'm easy.
Well, maybe not too easy.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.748
- Oh!
- Oh!

43:37.815 --> 43:39.183
He is doing good
for getting out of his shell.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.018
Yeah.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.920
from coming the bottom
of my heart for spending

43:42.987 --> 43:45.189
this time,
taking the time to know me.

43:45.289 --> 43:47.791
I couldn't have had
a better date tonight.

43:47.858 --> 43:50.761
I don't know if I see
a romantic connection,

43:50.828 --> 43:53.631
but for a first date,
she had a good time.

43:53.697 --> 43:55.299
And so I'm very proud of her.

43:55.366 --> 43:58.535
Give you a big hug.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.537
Yeah, no, thank you.
I'm so happy.

44:00.638 --> 44:03.140
Thank you for your time.
Thank you for your time, Phill.

44:03.207 --> 44:04.842
- It was, like, wholesome.
- It was.

44:04.942 --> 44:06.210
It was very wholesome.

44:06.310 --> 44:07.511
Let me get this
for you.

44:07.611 --> 44:08.946
Thank you, Phill.

44:10.180 --> 44:12.049
I want to see Troy.
That's what I want to see.

44:12.149 --> 44:14.218
- Ah!
- Troy.

44:14.318 --> 44:15.619
Oh, come on, man.

44:15.686 --> 44:17.321
Man, I don't know how I feel
about being responsible

44:17.388 --> 44:18.989
for my dad's love life
right now.

44:19.056 --> 44:21.392
No, you just want him
to be happy. That's all of us.

44:22.559 --> 44:24.294
- What?
- "Meddle Time"?

44:24.361 --> 44:25.729
Oh, no.

44:25.829 --> 44:27.164
Oh, no.

44:27.231 --> 44:30.167
"Give your dad the chance
to have an unexpected date

44:30.234 --> 44:32.803
with the mom of your choice."

44:32.870 --> 44:35.706
What do you guys think? Do I put
him on a date with Karen?

44:38.075 --> 44:40.077
What do you think
he wants?

44:42.012 --> 44:43.514
I don't want to get my dad
involved

44:43.580 --> 44:45.482
in a love triangle, dude,
but I also don't want him to,

44:45.549 --> 44:47.084
like,
get his little heart broken.

44:47.184 --> 44:49.920
I am definitely a little
worried about Noah

44:50.020 --> 44:52.690
messing with my mom's love life.

44:54.024 --> 44:55.659
Um...

44:55.726 --> 44:58.929
It's not the time to be messing
with our parents.

44:59.029 --> 45:04.001
I'm just not seeing
this work out for either of us.

45:04.068 --> 45:06.103
I wish...

45:06.203 --> 45:07.938
to proceed.

45:08.038 --> 45:09.840
I want my dad to go
on the date.

45:15.512 --> 45:18.916
Hey, Karen.
Will you please follow me?
