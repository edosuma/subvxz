WEBVTT

00:38.830 --> 00:41.416
So you've, uh, got bedbugs?

00:41.499 --> 00:43.084
It was only a matter of time.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.545
Man, you look like
a goddang ol' leopard, man.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.005
Talking about it makes me itch.

00:47.088 --> 00:48.131

Man!

00:48.214 --> 00:49.716
It's not just Bill!

00:49.799 --> 00:52.218
There's a bedbug epidemic going on!

00:52.302 --> 00:54.054
Well, you're awful chipper about it.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.139
I've got more work than I can handle.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.515
And my, shall we say,

00:57.599 --> 01:00.852
lack of competence
creates a lot of repeat business.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.272
Little help, Hank?

01:08.276 --> 01:09.152
Of course not.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.908
For only a thousand dollars...

01:14.991 --> 01:16.910
we could rent a matching set of penguins

01:16.993 --> 01:19.579
to show people to their reception tables.

01:19.662 --> 01:21.831
Huh. Sounds kind of classy.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.919
That is your third snort
in five minutes, Hank.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.755
And I know for a fact
you do not have a head cold.

01:28.838 --> 01:32.092
I'm sorry. But this wedding
is getting out of control.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.844
What you guys should be doing
is saving your money

01:34.928 --> 01:36.930
so you can move out of my den.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.681
The house across the street's for sale.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.183
How about putting it towards that?

01:41.643 --> 01:42.769
Ooh!

01:42.852 --> 01:46.189
We could get married on a cliff
in front of a castle!

01:47.065 --> 01:49.651
Luanne, that's not even
a picture of a wedding.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.111
It's a Jaguar ad.

01:51.194 --> 01:56.074
Baby doll, there is nothing I want more
than to make your dreams come true.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.992
And since you're rich, you can!

01:58.076 --> 02:02.914
Well, now, my settlement money
was down to nine thousand dollars

02:02.997 --> 02:04.541
after buying my new truck rims.

02:04.624 --> 02:05.792
You're rich and you can.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.086
Of course, baby girl.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.466
<i>It's just dang ridiculous.</i>

02:13.550 --> 02:15.677
They should be planning for their future.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.887
A future that's not in my den.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.765
Hank, Luanne is a pregnant college dropout

02:20.849 --> 02:24.561
marrying a 38-year-old,
snaggletoothed, slip and fall man.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.813
It is extremely likely
that her wedding day

02:26.896 --> 02:29.274
is going to be the best day of her life.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.234
Do not take that away from her.

02:34.362 --> 02:35.363
Lucky?

02:36.197 --> 02:37.448
Evening, Uncle Hank.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.909
I'd give it a minute if I were you.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.202
Oh, and by the way,

02:41.286 --> 02:45.623
I share your concerns about being able
to provide for Luanne's future.

02:46.207 --> 02:49.043
Well, if you're that concerned,
you could always get a job.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.503
A job, huh?

02:50.587 --> 02:53.464
Well, I did always like the idea
of being a State Trooper.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.342
You know, the hunted becomes
the hunter type thing?

02:56.426 --> 02:58.136
But I don't think they'll go for it.

02:58.219 --> 02:59.596
Thanks anyway, Uncle Hank.

03:02.390 --> 03:05.810
Uh, Peggy, I'm gonna go
brush my teeth at Boomhauer's.

03:09.397 --> 03:13.193
"With liberty and justice for all. Amen."

03:13.276 --> 03:15.403
All right, everybody. Let's get to work.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.155
Dale, what are you doing here?

03:17.238 --> 03:19.199
I'm here to treat for bedbugs.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.326
Isn't it great? They're everywhere.

03:23.077 --> 03:23.953
Whoa!

03:24.037 --> 03:25.622
Is it okay to breathe this stuff?

03:25.705 --> 03:27.624
No time for small talk, Enrique.

03:27.707 --> 03:30.793
I have ten other service calls today,
and I'm already running behind.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.837
Well, if you're really stretched that thin

03:32.921 --> 03:34.339
Lucky's looking for a job.

03:34.422 --> 03:35.924
He's got a baby on the way

03:36.007 --> 03:38.176
and needs to find a place
of his own to raise it.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.802
Hmm.

03:39.886 --> 03:43.139
A man under extreme domestic pressure.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.683
He would be very compliant.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.936
Tell him to report at 09:00 hours.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.854
And it's his day to bring muffins.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.481
Oops!

03:54.317 --> 03:56.653
Lord, these gowns are pricey!

03:56.736 --> 03:57.779
Uh-huh.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.739
And as a pregnant bride

03:59.822 --> 04:02.617
the more money you spend,
the less shame you'll feel.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.954
Now, Luanne is going to assign
each of you a body part.

04:06.037 --> 04:08.706
And you have to tell her
if it looks bad in the dress.

04:08.790 --> 04:09.791
I've got back fat!

04:10.917 --> 04:11.876
I found it!

04:12.460 --> 04:14.796
Her butt going to look huge in that.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.340
I've got backside!

04:17.423 --> 04:18.299
Hm.

04:21.052 --> 04:24.806
Welcome to Dale's Dead Bug
World Headquarters!

04:24.889 --> 04:26.432
All right, time to gear up.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.892
This is your gas mask.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.435
And these are your goggles.

04:36.484 --> 04:37.819
You look like a bug!

04:37.902 --> 04:39.487
You look like a bug.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.698
And I know what to do with a bug.

04:41.781 --> 04:42.657
Ha!

04:42.740 --> 04:44.200
Ha, ha, ha!

04:44.284 --> 04:45.451
-Yeah!
-A-ha!

04:45.535 --> 04:46.577
-Aha!
-Ya-ha!

04:49.789 --> 04:50.957
She-shaa!

04:52.917 --> 04:54.085
Hay-yaa!

04:56.796 --> 04:57.714
Ew...

05:04.137 --> 05:07.557
Why do my boyfriends always die?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.142
I'm so sorry, Lucky.

05:09.225 --> 05:10.184
I'm...

05:12.478 --> 05:14.230
I'm so sorry!

05:15.606 --> 05:17.692
You got nothing
to be sorry for, Dale.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.277
These things just happen.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.029
Everything's gonna be fine.

05:21.904 --> 05:23.114
Wow, Lucky.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.116
That's really philosophical of you.

05:25.199 --> 05:27.952
Well, I've been through this
a couple times before.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.538
Of course, I'm gonna have to sue you.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.832
But after that,
everything's gonna be fine.

05:32.915 --> 05:34.709
-Sue me?
-Hang in there, buddy.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.753
I'm giving you a morphine drip.

05:36.836 --> 05:37.712
Appreciate it.

05:37.795 --> 05:40.381
I find that three CC's dulls the pain

05:40.465 --> 05:43.426
without affecting the admissibility
of my testimony.

05:44.677 --> 05:45.553
Mmm...

05:55.813 --> 05:56.731
<i>Ow.</i>

05:57.523 --> 05:59.442
I'm sorry you're in such pain.

05:59.525 --> 06:03.988
Me having to sue Dale hurts almost
as much as my grievous injuries.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.782
But I have no choice.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.117
I can't work and you need your wedding.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.037
And now because of your ruptures
and contusions,

06:11.120 --> 06:13.414
we can have a fantastic wedding!

06:15.458 --> 06:17.710
Hey! It's Lawyer Johnson!

06:17.794 --> 06:20.380
Hello, Lucky! Mm!

06:20.463 --> 06:22.757
When I say you look like a million bucks,
I mean it!

06:22.840 --> 06:25.635
Are you the one who's gonna
get us all the money?

06:25.718 --> 06:27.303
Lucky's done the hard part.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.807
So you suffering from nausea,
blackouts, vomiting?

06:30.890 --> 06:33.059
No more so than usual.

06:33.142 --> 06:33.976
I didn't hear that.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.937
I just heard nausea,
blackouts, and vomiting.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.440
Now, Mister Johnson,
since I'm suing a friend of the family

06:39.524 --> 06:41.109
I don't want to get greedy.

06:41.192 --> 06:42.860
Mm. That's very noble.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.613
You just leave the worrying
about being greedy to me.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.452
I can't believe I'm getting sued!

06:51.536 --> 06:54.205
And by Edward Johnson, the king of torts!

06:54.288 --> 06:56.666
He won that title in a lawsuit, you know.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.418
You've got to help me, Hank!

06:58.501 --> 07:01.295
Well, look, I know
this whole thing is asinine.

07:01.379 --> 07:04.799
But this is exactly
why you have liability insurance.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.427
You do have liability insurance,
don't you?

07:07.510 --> 07:10.096
Yeah. Because you made me.

07:10.179 --> 07:11.639
Hey, thanks.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.059
How about this, Luanne?

07:15.143 --> 07:17.895
You ride down the aisle on a white horse.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.147
White horse?

07:19.230 --> 07:20.440
Seen it.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.150
How about a unicorn?

07:24.277 --> 07:27.280
Uncle Hank, you have to try this cake.

07:27.363 --> 07:30.533
The icing is made out of 24-carat gold.

07:30.616 --> 07:34.203
You're so bent on wasting money
you're gonna eat gold?

07:34.287 --> 07:36.038
Extravagance!

07:36.122 --> 07:38.458
What if we have doves land on the cake?

07:38.541 --> 07:41.335
Of course, we'll have to train them
not to poop on it!

07:51.053 --> 07:53.097
-

08:03.483 --> 08:06.235
I'm not insured!

08:09.155 --> 08:11.949
Mister Gribble, I'd like to thank you
for coming today with your counsel.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.034
Don't answer that!

08:13.117 --> 08:14.535
It wasn't a question, counselor.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.536
It was a pleasantry.

08:15.620 --> 08:16.871
Don't look at me!

08:17.872 --> 08:19.707
Mister Gribble,
with your counsel's permission,

08:19.790 --> 08:21.584
and mind you, I'm not looking at him,

08:21.667 --> 08:23.628
I would like to address
your lack of insurance.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.630
Where will we get the money
for our wedding?

08:25.713 --> 08:26.881
My dear, don't worry.

08:26.964 --> 08:29.800
Rule number one in litigation
is somebody always pays.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.095
Now, my client's injuries resulted

08:33.179 --> 08:35.640
from an incident involving
pesticide spray.

08:35.723 --> 08:36.974
Who makes your pesticide?

08:37.058 --> 08:41.103
And the answer I'm looking for
is one of the deep-pocket poison makers...

08:41.187 --> 08:43.105
Dow, DuPont, Ciba-Geigy.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.398
I make my own.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.067
Oh, okay.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.569
Uh, what about the stairs Lucky fell down?

08:48.653 --> 08:50.821
Were they built by a large developer?

08:50.905 --> 08:52.240
Successful contractor?

08:52.323 --> 08:54.659
I built them without a permit.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.120
Well, Dale's Dead Bug gets us nothing.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.957
Uh, if you wanna play hardball,
we could probably take Gribble's house.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.959
Yeah, let's take Gribble's house.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.835
No! Don't take Gribble's house!

09:04.919 --> 09:06.546
Believe me, you don't want it!

09:06.629 --> 09:08.714
There's so many liens
and assessments against it

09:08.798 --> 09:10.174
Gribble barely owns it!

09:10.258 --> 09:12.343
Yeah. Well, it's still better
than nothing.

09:12.426 --> 09:13.636
I'm sorry, Dale.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.972
Damn Hank for making me hire you!

09:17.098 --> 09:19.475
Hank? Who's Hank?

09:22.478 --> 09:25.356
We have a 24-hour rule here, Joe Jack.

09:28.359 --> 09:29.569
Good news, Hank!

09:29.652 --> 09:31.612
Lucky's not suing me anymore.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.197
We resolved everything.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.699
Oh, thank God!

09:34.782 --> 09:37.743
So I guess that means
you two are gonna have a sensible

09:37.827 --> 09:39.870
inexpensive wedding after all, huh?

09:39.954 --> 09:40.913
Nuh-uh.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.707
It's gonna be a blowout!

09:43.541 --> 09:46.377
Mister Hill, I have filed a lawsuit
on behalf of my client

09:46.460 --> 09:48.379
-against Strickland Propane.
-What?

09:48.462 --> 09:50.381
How can you possibly sue Strickland?

09:50.464 --> 09:53.009
Because it was you
as a Strickland Propane employee

09:53.092 --> 09:56.012
who set this tragic chain
of events in motion.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.847
Yeah! None of this would have happened

09:57.930 --> 09:59.974
if you hadn't persuaded me to hire Lucky.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.227
I'm getting my dream wedding!

10:04.562 --> 10:06.105
Let me get a hug too.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.066
Uncle Hank, bring your leg over here.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.901
It's the best I can do.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.909
You explain to me
how Strickland had anything to do

10:18.993 --> 10:20.119
with Lucky getting hurt.

10:20.202 --> 10:21.704
And no mumbo jumbo.

10:21.787 --> 10:26.334
Strickland Propane is what the law
refers to as the "respondent superior".

10:26.417 --> 10:29.253
That's mumbo jumbo for when an employer,

10:29.337 --> 10:31.964
Strickland Propane, is responsible
for the wrongful acts

10:32.048 --> 10:33.799
of its employee, you.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.389
Buck's making a dash for his Caddy!

10:42.642 --> 10:45.227
Uh, we got a situation here, Buck.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.562
I know it, Old Top.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.899
Got my trouble bag
and I'm headed for the border!

10:56.489 --> 10:58.366
Since you're jobless,

10:58.449 --> 11:01.202
we can take
as long a honeymoon as we want.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.372
What are you so mad about?

11:04.455 --> 11:07.750
Strickland Propane's got the insurance
to pay for everything!

11:07.833 --> 11:09.377
Because it's wrong!

11:09.460 --> 11:12.755
Frivolous lawsuits are chasing
good people out of business.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.590
People who sell propane,

11:14.674 --> 11:17.134
people who manufacture flu vaccine,

11:17.218 --> 11:18.844
and people who make lawn darts.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.597
And one day
because of all the damn lawyers

11:21.681 --> 11:24.642
there might not even be
any doctors to deliver babies!

11:24.725 --> 11:26.852
I get the propane and doctors.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.021
But what's wrong with lawn darts?

11:37.154 --> 11:40.282
I hate to see a man Armor
all his truck in anger.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.202
I guess you got every right
to be mad at me, Uncle Hank.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.705
But Luanne wants her
dream wedding pretty bad.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.541
So you're gonna sue innocent people
to give it to her?

11:49.625 --> 11:52.586
Look, Lucky, this isn't just about
getting out of my house

11:52.670 --> 11:54.672
or throwing an extravagant wedding.

11:54.755 --> 11:57.800
This is about knowing the difference
between right and wrong

11:57.883 --> 11:59.510
so you can teach it to your kids.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.769
So you ate the warning label
and choked on it?

12:08.853 --> 12:11.480
Yeah. And now I want to sue someone
for a lot of money!

12:11.564 --> 12:12.606
You're the boss, Jimmy.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.275
I'm the boss!

12:17.361 --> 12:20.197
Mister Johnson, I wanna drop the lawsuit.

12:20.281 --> 12:23.325
I don't feel right about
suing Strickland Propane.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.827
They didn't do nothing wrong.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.121
Well, they were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.748
That's... that's two wrongs.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.293
Look, Lucky,
you've got a winner of a case.

12:32.376 --> 12:35.421
I'd be guilty of legal malpractice
if I let you drop it.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.757
You don't want me
to lose my license, do you?

12:42.803 --> 12:44.346
For God's sake, Bill!

12:44.430 --> 12:45.848
You've been picking, haven't you?

12:45.931 --> 12:48.225
I'm sorry, Hank. I'm a picker.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.853
Uncle Hank, I tried to drop the lawsuit.

12:50.936 --> 12:54.857
But Lawyer Johnson explained to me
in lawyer talk how it couldn't be done.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.609
I guess we're gonna have

12:56.692 --> 12:58.527
to hire a lawyer of our own.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.489
Buck's got a list of them
taped under his desk.

13:01.572 --> 13:02.907
Unless...

13:02.990 --> 13:05.534
But most of Buck's lawyers
are maternity guys.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.161
I said unless!

13:07.787 --> 13:08.788
Thank you.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.999
Okay, everyone always fakes an injury
so they can sue.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.126
But just suppose Lucky were to fake

13:14.210 --> 13:17.046
not being injured so he couldn't sue?

13:17.129 --> 13:20.800
Elegant, unexpected, not cliché.

13:20.883 --> 13:21.759
Huh.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.220
If we make it look like Lucky's not hurt,

13:24.303 --> 13:26.680
then Johnson can't make money
on this case.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.641
I bet he'll drop it in a heartbeat.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.229
All right, you ready?

13:33.312 --> 13:34.563
I reckon.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.279
That's the lady's tee.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.073
I ain't hitting from the lady's tee.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.991
It really doesn't matter.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.202
I ain't hitting from the lady's tee.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.954
All right.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.252
Action.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.593
Cut.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.011
Ow!

14:09.849 --> 14:11.475
I know you're in misery, Lucky.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.561
But just try
to hold it together long enough

14:13.644 --> 14:15.104
for Johnson to see the tape.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.024
Well, this is an unexpected visit.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.651
But they cost the same as any other.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.111
Four hundred dollars an hour.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.821
Well, this won't take long.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.990
I caught this joker red-handed.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.741
He's faking his injuries.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.202
I give you Exhibit A.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.377
Well, ain't this a curveball!

14:38.460 --> 14:40.337
If this tape is shown in court,

14:40.421 --> 14:43.132
Mister Hill and Strickland Propane
are off the hook.

14:43.966 --> 14:47.636
Well, if Strickland Propane's
deep pockets are closed

14:47.720 --> 14:52.558
then Lucky's gonna have some
sizeable legal fees to settle... himself.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.143
I reckon that's fair.

14:54.226 --> 14:57.354
As soon as I get a job,
I'll put in for overtime.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.076
Thanks.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.582
Well, I'm not your goddang maid!

15:17.958 --> 15:19.585
-Allow me!
-I'll... I'll get it!

15:21.629 --> 15:24.256
Let the man with the perfectly
healthy back pick it up.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.943
-Dale, you look like a bug.
-What?

15:44.026 --> 15:45.861
I said you look like a bug.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.113
And I know what to do with bugs.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.365
Remember?

15:49.448 --> 15:50.532
Uh...

15:55.788 --> 15:58.457
I believe I do!

16:00.125 --> 16:01.168
En garde!

16:01.251 --> 16:02.294
A swish-swish-sha!

16:02.378 --> 16:04.046
Aaah!

16:04.129 --> 16:06.298
Oh, my God! My back!

16:06.382 --> 16:07.466
I can't move!

16:09.969 --> 16:11.553
What the heck is wrong with you?

16:11.637 --> 16:15.557
Oh, uh, these two are always
horsing around with each other.

16:15.641 --> 16:19.395
Whether it's on the stairs of Dale's house
or inside your office.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.230
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on here.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.564
You can't blame this on me.

16:22.648 --> 16:23.857
Well, sure we can.

16:23.941 --> 16:24.984
According to this tape,

16:25.067 --> 16:27.820
Lucky was healthy
until he got to your office.

16:27.903 --> 16:31.573
I'm sure there's plenty of lawyers
who would like to help us make that case.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.659
Okay, okay. I hear you.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.912
I'll pay your usual settlement quote
but not a penny more.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.711
Fifty-three thousand dollars?

16:43.794 --> 16:47.339
We could pay LeAnn Rimes
to sing <i>Here Comes the Bride</i>!

16:47.423 --> 16:49.925
Yeah. I suppose we could do that.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.470
Or we could use the money
for something more responsible.

16:53.554 --> 16:54.930
How does that sound?

16:55.014 --> 16:57.433
Sounds like you've been talking
to Uncle Hank.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.143
Hear me out, baby girl.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.270
We could have a small wedding here

17:01.353 --> 17:03.313
and use this money to put a down payment

17:03.397 --> 17:04.940
on that house across the way,

17:05.024 --> 17:07.443
cover expenses while I find a job,

17:07.526 --> 17:09.445
and buy more of these!

17:10.029 --> 17:14.533
Our baby has a wardrobe to wear
in our new house?

17:15.325 --> 17:16.618
I love you, Luanne.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.871
I love you too, Lucky.

17:24.293 --> 17:25.753
Eh!

17:25.836 --> 17:29.214
I have been told
not to let anyone see the bride.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.633
Just let me in the door, son.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.555
-My dad's here to see you.
-Let him in.

17:37.556 --> 17:40.559
Uncle Hank, I'm glad you gave Lucky and me

17:40.642 --> 17:42.227
a simple, plain wedding

17:42.311 --> 17:44.938
that doesn't really stand out.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.066
It could be anyone's really.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.818
The folding chairs are very nice.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.572
Look, Luanne, I know I didn't give you
the wedding cake made of gold

17:53.655 --> 17:55.949
or the Jaguar ad of your dreams.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.036
But I wanted you to have this
as a wedding present.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.829
Is it a bill?

18:00.913 --> 18:04.917
It's a fun fare to anywhere you and Lucky
wanna go for your honeymoon

18:05.000 --> 18:07.169
in the continental United States.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.755
Some restrictions do apply.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.673
We could go to Dollywood!

18:11.757 --> 18:14.176
Or the real Mystic Pizza!

18:15.511 --> 18:16.428
Oh!

18:16.512 --> 18:19.181
Oh, thank you.

18:21.850 --> 18:25.395
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but Reverend Stroup is here.

18:31.568 --> 18:32.945
Yuh-huh.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.447
I'll take it that by "yuh-huh,"

18:35.531 --> 18:37.533
Luanne is saying "I do."

18:37.616 --> 18:38.784
Yuh-huh!

18:38.867 --> 18:41.453
Then I pronounce Elroy Kleinschmidt

18:41.537 --> 18:44.498
and Luanne Platter man and wife.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.625
You may now kiss the bride.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.553
Let's celebrate!

18:57.636 --> 19:00.806
Mister Kahn, I'll have a mai tai!

19:11.984 --> 19:13.026
Hey, hey!

19:27.791 --> 19:28.959
Hmm...

19:29.418 --> 19:30.711
This isn't rice.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.296
It's birdseed, dude.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.089
Hm...

19:39.678 --> 19:42.014
Bye!

19:42.097 --> 19:43.765
Okay, I'm gonna throw it now.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.562
I got it!

19:48.645 --> 19:52.065
Connie! You drop that right now
and wash your hands!

19:56.195 --> 19:58.363
This is a blessed day.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.949
Now, who wants to rock?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.201
-Yeah, let's do it!
-Whoo!

20:02.284 --> 20:03.785
-I do!
-Yeah!

20:17.966 --> 20:19.092
Hey, Minh!

20:19.176 --> 20:20.427
It's our song!

20:25.265 --> 20:26.767
Hold on, baby doll.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.394
Come on, Bobby.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.646
Let's help them out.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.069
Wow, man. I tell you what, man,

20:37.152 --> 20:39.363
like the dang ol' enormity of it all, man.

20:39.446 --> 20:40.405
Wow.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.574
You just gave away a bride, Hank.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.909
I know.

20:43.992 --> 20:45.035
I've got, uh...

20:45.118 --> 20:48.497
Well, I guess you'd call it... emotions.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.831
Me too!

20:49.915 --> 20:51.708
I'm a sucker for weddings!

20:51.792 --> 20:54.336
All the flowers and the loving vows

20:54.419 --> 20:56.672
and the ring pillow and...

20:58.131 --> 20:59.174
I'm sorry.

21:05.681 --> 21:06.640
Yup.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.100
Yup.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.268
Mm-hm.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.228
Yup.
