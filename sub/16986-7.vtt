00:23.148 --> 00:24.316
[giggling]

00:27.486 --> 00:29.780
[chuckling]

00:31.990 --> 00:34.243
[giggling]
Shh.

00:34.326 --> 00:38.205
Okay, now, all we do is push real hard,

00:38.288 --> 00:41.375
and the ramu...
[giggling] will tip over.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.834
[laughing]

00:44.711 --> 00:48.465
Hey, Eep, how did you come up with
something so pointless and stupid?

00:48.548 --> 00:50.759
These things just come to me.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.135
Now push.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.097
[screaming]

00:57.015 --> 00:59.268
- [Eep] Nailed it.
- [Lerk] Take that, ramu!

00:59.351 --> 01:01.311
- [laughing]
- [groaning]

01:01.395 --> 01:04.313
- [both laughing]
- Nice.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.943
[Grug] Eep Crood, you are in big trouble.

01:08.026 --> 01:10.445
- Oh, no. The man!
- [both yelping]

01:11.113 --> 01:13.282
- [grunting]
- Sneaking out of the cave after dark...

01:14.366 --> 01:16.034
on a school night!

01:16.118 --> 01:19.496
Oh, Eep, ramu-tipping
is incredibly dangerous.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.165
Bear owls hunt sleeping ramu.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.085
But we were just having fun.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.337
Fun?
Who taught you that word?

01:27.421 --> 01:28.922
- [groaning]
- [grumbling]

01:29.006 --> 01:32.843
[Lerk] This is a father-daughter talk,
so I'll just see myself out.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.096
- [grunting]
- [grumbling]

01:43.687 --> 01:46.648
Young cave lady, you are grounded!

01:47.190 --> 01:49.901
But, but, but, but, but...
[groaning]

01:51.236 --> 01:52.070
There.

01:52.154 --> 01:54.531
Don't make me take away
your head privileges.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.700
Dad!

01:58.035 --> 02:00.287
<i>♪ Bom-bom, bom-ba-dum ♪</i>

02:00.370 --> 02:03.165
<i>♪ Ma-ma-ma-bom-ba-dum
Ba-da-dum ♪</i>

02:05.959 --> 02:08.127
This is so unfair.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.547
You are the meanest father in the world!

02:10.631 --> 02:12.507
And I can't even reach my meat.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.426
[groaning]

02:16.428 --> 02:18.805
Grug, can't we let her out yet?

02:18.889 --> 02:20.432
She's been in there all night.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.476
I don't want the worms to get any ideas.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.811
Yeah, and ground me next.

02:24.895 --> 02:28.106
It looks so cozy,
like being hugged by the dirt.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.107
No, son.

02:29.191 --> 02:32.444
You only get grounded
when you do something reckless.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.238
Ohhh!

02:35.322 --> 02:38.158
[groaning]
I was not being reckless.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.869
My friends and I
had a really tough day at school.

02:40.952 --> 02:43.955
Two students were eaten,
and we had a test.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.875
So I just needed to be
a teen and cut loose.

02:46.958 --> 02:50.670
Oh, here we go again
with this "teens" nonsense.

02:50.754 --> 02:55.300
Teenager is just a thing you kids invented
to get out of adult responsibility.

02:55.384 --> 02:58.011
Back in my day,
there were no teens.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.931
We just went straight from being babies
to really short grown-ups.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.183
It was hard,
and we liked it that way.

03:03.266 --> 03:08.021
Hey, Dad, I'm letting all the cold air in,
bein' reckless.

03:08.105 --> 03:11.900
Maybe you should, I don't know,
do something about it. Eh?

03:11.983 --> 03:12.859
Hard?

03:12.943 --> 03:15.779
Dad, you have no idea
how hard it is to be a teen.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.197
Oh, sure.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.867
Sitting around, whining,
talking back to my parents.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.494
So hard.

03:22.577 --> 03:26.164
Ha! I just used your
own teenage sarcasm against you.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.165
Whoops.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.459
I just made a mess in the cave.

03:29.543 --> 03:33.380
Gosh,
when did I become such a bad boy?

03:33.463 --> 03:37.759
Guess I'll need to be punished,
but how? Hmm?

03:37.843 --> 03:40.804
Dad, you wouldn't survive
one day as a teenager.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.390
- I would so.
- [cackles]

03:43.473 --> 03:44.975
Uh, no.
No way.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.643
[chuckles]
Uh, yeah.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.104
See? I'm talking like a teen already.

03:49.187 --> 03:53.525
Oh, yeah? Then I dare you
to survive one day as a teen.

03:53.942 --> 03:54.818
You're on.

03:54.901 --> 03:55.986
I will show you.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.865
I will be a teen for a day,
and I'll show all you teens.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.032
Let's go!

04:01.575 --> 04:03.744
- Uh, Dad?
- Oh, right.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.872
First I dig you out,
then I show all of you.

04:06.955 --> 04:10.876
Only thing you're gonna show 'em
is what not to be when they grow up.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.127
[cackling]

04:12.210 --> 04:13.920
[moaning]

04:14.379 --> 04:15.379
See, Mom?

04:15.422 --> 04:19.634
I told you something bad would happen
if you didn't clean your teeth every moon,

04:19.718 --> 04:23.764
and now there's a giant black hole
in your tooth.

04:24.347 --> 04:28.059
Stay away from it.
That's where I store my eat-laters.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.104
[moaning]

04:31.188 --> 04:33.356
[gulping]
Grug, take Sandy to the sitter.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.234
Gran and I
are going to the Den of Teeth.

04:38.361 --> 04:41.114
[sighing] And I'm gonna need you
to gather water and dinner.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.867
This is gonna take a while.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.536
Got it, honey.
Sandy, water, food...

04:47.412 --> 04:50.332
right after I prove my daughter wrong.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.875
- [panting]
- Thanks, Sandy.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.461
There.
I'm grounded.

04:59.674 --> 05:02.135
On second thought, this is terrible.

05:04.012 --> 05:04.888
[sighing]

05:04.971 --> 05:07.682
This is what you get for being reckless,
Thunk.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.604
Hey, Eep, fun times
ramu-tipping last night.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.272
[giggling]

05:14.356 --> 05:17.275
Oh, and Lerk, way to survive.

05:17.359 --> 05:20.529
Why, thank you.
I am hard to kill.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.240
Hope you didn't get into
too much trouble with your dad.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.867
About my dad.
Funny story.

05:27.619 --> 05:30.163
Hey, Eep's friends.

05:30.247 --> 05:33.542
As you kids say, what's upwards?
[chuckling]

05:36.670 --> 05:39.339
[groaning]
He thinks being a teenager's easy,

05:39.422 --> 05:41.925
so I said he couldn't last
one day being one.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.512
Yeah.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.097
I'm not walking with you.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.015
I judge you to be uncool.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.099
Uncool?

05:50.141 --> 05:51.643
Huh, how can you judge me?

05:51.726 --> 05:53.687
- You don't even know...
- Judged.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.022
Sulk, you know what to do.

05:56.106 --> 05:59.276
Uh, should I?
He is a grown-up.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.360
Not today.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.904
Today, I am a teen.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.864
Okay!
[screams]

06:05.240 --> 06:06.825
[laughing]

06:11.663 --> 06:12.789
Good pelting.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.041
A little sloppy on the technique, but...

06:15.125 --> 06:17.210
Gotta hurry or we'll be marked late.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.462
Unless you wanna back out of this now.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.881
[chuckling]
Yeah, right.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.800
This is even easier than I thought.

06:24.926 --> 06:25.969
[laughing]

06:30.140 --> 06:32.058
[Lerk chuckling]

06:32.642 --> 06:33.893
[Squawk] Parent?

06:33.977 --> 06:35.061
What are you doing here?

06:35.145 --> 06:38.273
- Well, I am here to show my daughter...
- I don't really care.

06:38.356 --> 06:41.359
I do my best not to know
anything about my students.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.902
Now everyone take a seat.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.696
Ooh, saved you a seat.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.531
[chuckling]

06:48.408 --> 06:49.576
- [squeaking]
- [laughing]

06:54.122 --> 06:55.248
[squeaking]

06:56.708 --> 06:58.793
- [squeaking]
- [muttering]

06:58.877 --> 07:00.879
[snickering]

07:00.962 --> 07:03.006
A toot fruit?
Really?

07:03.089 --> 07:06.426
Class, enough snickering
at our new student.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.762
Well, actually, let's snicker a bit more.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.221
[snickering]

07:11.765 --> 07:14.142
Okay, that's enough.

07:14.225 --> 07:19.230
And I am so glad that after yesterday's
exciting hands-on bear owl lesson,

07:19.314 --> 07:22.442
so many of you could make it
back to school today.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.487
Um, will everyone
who got mauled be okay?

07:25.570 --> 07:27.405
[chuckling]
No.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.324
Let's begin with a pop quiz.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.743
Pick which berry isn't pure poison.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.036
Any volunteers to go first?

07:34.454 --> 07:35.454
[all]
Grug.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.167
Pfft. Fine.
This can't be too hard.

07:39.751 --> 07:40.877
What was that rhyme?

07:40.961 --> 07:44.923
"If they're black, you don't snack.
If they're gray, eat away."

07:46.132 --> 07:47.842
So close, but it's actually,

07:47.926 --> 07:51.179
"If they're gray,
you'll get violently ill today."

07:52.013 --> 07:55.058
Huh? That's not nearly as catchy.
[groaning]

07:55.141 --> 07:56.768
[laughing]

08:01.439 --> 08:04.693
It's not funny.
Stop laughing!

08:04.776 --> 08:05.776
[snickering]

08:05.819 --> 08:09.489
It was a trick question.
They're all poison.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.118
[grunting]

08:13.201 --> 08:15.245
[screaming]

08:15.328 --> 08:18.248
You have nothing to be afraid of.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.501
Of course I do.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.879
My teeth are the last
functional bits I have left.

08:24.963 --> 08:28.133
If this guy takes my choppers,
I got nothin'.

08:28.216 --> 08:32.721
Ugga, if they take my teeth,
they take my pride.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.557
[straining]

08:37.225 --> 08:40.395
Mom, are you trying
to make yourself cry?

08:40.937 --> 08:42.230
Aw, rats.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.607
Even my eye water's busted.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.151
[groaning]

08:46.234 --> 08:47.986
[screaming]

08:50.822 --> 08:54.617
And now, class, a real hunting lesson.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.703
Yes, bonking!

08:56.786 --> 08:58.288
Now this will be easy.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.498
No, no, no, you're teenagers.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.459
I'm not trusting you with rocks.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.627
We're playing "dodgefruit."

09:04.711 --> 09:06.171
Avoid getting hit by fruit,

09:06.254 --> 09:09.174
just like you'd avoid
getting hit by a predator.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.467
And go!

09:11.509 --> 09:13.511
But this isn't how hunting works!

09:15.638 --> 09:17.557
[grunting]
Ow.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.476
Oh, nice hit, Shouty!

09:19.559 --> 09:21.811
I channel my anger into sport!

09:24.564 --> 09:26.900
[groaning, grunting]

09:32.572 --> 09:35.492
Wait, wait, guys.
Come on, can't we talk about this?

09:35.575 --> 09:38.119
Put down the smash fruits,
we can work something out.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.623
Maybe that's how it works out
on the hunting fields,

09:41.706 --> 09:44.125
but you're in our world now, punk!

09:44.209 --> 09:47.670
Get ready to taste our smash fruit.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.881
Taste smash fruits?

09:49.964 --> 09:51.466
That I can do.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.264
[chuckling]

09:58.598 --> 09:59.808
Take that!

09:59.891 --> 10:01.309
Delicious.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.065
That all you got?
That was easy.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.067
What are you doing?

10:09.150 --> 10:12.320
I said dodge the fruit, not eat the fruit.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.198
That was my lunch,
my dinner, my late-night snack.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.825
My late-late-night snack!

10:16.908 --> 10:19.536
Teacher Squawk
really loves his snacks.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.915
Uh, I'm sorry?

10:23.998 --> 10:26.376
Sorry?
You should be sorry.

10:27.001 --> 10:30.171
And now I'm emotional,
and I can't even eat my feelings.

10:30.713 --> 10:31.589
That's it.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.133
You're going to Deep Trouble.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.636
What?
You can't do that.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.846
Well, sure, I can.

10:37.929 --> 10:40.014
I'm the adult.
You're the teenagers.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.850
I can send him to Deep Trouble.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.977
- Hey, why me?
- And him.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.062
I hate being used as an example.

10:48.439 --> 10:49.440
And her.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.442
One step ahead of you.

10:53.236 --> 10:57.073
Basically, I can do anything I want,
and you can't stop me.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.450
But it's not fair.

10:59.534 --> 11:02.120
Yep.
And now you're a teenager.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.621
[screaming]

11:03.705 --> 11:04.706
[grunting]

11:11.462 --> 11:14.173
That feels like enough school for today.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.845
Why should I be in Deep Trouble?

11:18.928 --> 11:21.723
He's the one who had the stupid idea
for stupid dodgefruit.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.893
[imitating] "I'm Teacher Squawk.
I don't get how hunting works.

11:24.976 --> 11:28.313
- Go to Deep Trouble."
- Hilarious!

11:28.396 --> 11:31.691
- That's so spot-on.
- [all laughing]

11:31.774 --> 11:33.943
That was... That was so...

11:34.027 --> 11:35.528
exactly like him.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.071
How is this funny?

11:37.155 --> 11:39.616
We've been punished
for no good reason.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.869
Uh, if I'm laughing, it's funny.

11:42.952 --> 11:46.372
Yeah.
I mean, if I didn't laugh, I'd cry.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.249
[sniffling]
A lot.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.752
Like, almost all the time.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.505
[cackling]

11:56.507 --> 11:59.093
Goofing off is the one consolation
we have as teenagers

11:59.177 --> 12:01.804
staring into the void
of our own insignificance.

12:02.847 --> 12:03.848
Wow.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.392
That was really... wow.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.811
Now pull my finger.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.563
[farting]

12:11.397 --> 12:12.941
Don't feel bad, Dad.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.443
Deep Trouble
makes everyone wanna give up.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.905
So we can end this now
as soon as you admit...

12:18.988 --> 12:20.114
You were right, Eep.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.950
Being a teenager is hard.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.826
You do deserve to cut loose.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.663
Yes!
You actually get it!

12:26.746 --> 12:28.957
Get it?
I am living it.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.961
- We should go have fun right now.
- Yeah! Wait. We?

12:33.044 --> 12:35.046
Yeah.
You, me, and my guys.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.631
You have guys?

12:38.216 --> 12:41.552
Oh, my guys.

12:41.636 --> 12:44.472
Eep, your dad rocks.

12:44.555 --> 12:47.684
He's like the master
at pulling people's fingers.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.561
- [farts]
- [laughing]

12:52.188 --> 12:56.651
You know, Dad,
I think I have made my point

12:56.734 --> 13:01.698
and you still have Dad chores to do,
so you don't have to stick around.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.409
Hey, who wants to do something dumb?

13:04.492 --> 13:08.621
Uh, Dad, I don't think my guys
want to hang out with...

13:08.705 --> 13:09.831
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes, yes!

13:09.914 --> 13:11.916
- Dumbness rules.
- Yes! Yes!

13:12.000 --> 13:15.169
Uh, guys, that's still my dad.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.714
You're hanging out with my dad.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.926
He likes dad stuff, like walking around
our cave in his underpelts.

13:22.010 --> 13:22.885
[laughing]

13:22.969 --> 13:25.513
- Hilarious!
- Oh, that's good.

13:25.596 --> 13:30.226
[sighing] And being a teenager
just got even harder.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.811
Thanks, Dad.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.980
You're welcome.
[cackling]

13:34.063 --> 13:35.063
[sighing]

13:35.189 --> 13:37.400
[wailing]

13:39.402 --> 13:41.738
Welcome to the Den of Teeth.
Get comfortable.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.741
I'll be with you once I finish up
with this poor guy.

13:46.325 --> 13:49.537
[man howling]
Why? Why?

13:49.620 --> 13:51.706
I don't think those are pain screams.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.791
They sound surprised.

13:53.875 --> 13:57.045
- [man] I am surprised.
- See?

13:57.128 --> 13:59.380
[man wailing]
By all the pain!

14:00.339 --> 14:02.800
[straining]

14:03.551 --> 14:05.219
[cheering]

14:07.013 --> 14:09.474
Wait.
This is our house.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.478
Ooh, we got us good!

14:14.479 --> 14:15.938
[cheering]

14:16.022 --> 14:17.774
Yes!

14:18.691 --> 14:21.944
- [groaning]
- [guffawing]

14:28.618 --> 14:30.036
- [growling]
- Easy, fellas.

14:30.119 --> 14:34.791
Me and my bone just
want directions to the watering hole.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.834
[whimpering, panting]

14:37.126 --> 14:40.004
Is it this way?

14:40.088 --> 14:42.131
Or is it this way?

14:52.934 --> 14:55.061
[cheering]

15:01.484 --> 15:02.484
[Eep grunting]

15:04.028 --> 15:05.738
[gasping, yelling]

15:13.704 --> 15:15.915
This is so crazy.
[giggling]

15:15.998 --> 15:17.250
[shushing]

15:25.842 --> 15:27.176
Huh?

15:28.010 --> 15:29.554
- [yelping]
- [roaring]

15:29.637 --> 15:31.264
Who did this?

15:31.347 --> 15:33.766
- It wasn't Eep!
- [laughing]

15:36.811 --> 15:38.896
- [mooing]
- [giggling]

15:39.105 --> 15:43.526
All right, what say we all find
a buffalippo and go for a joy ride?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.069
Yeah!

15:45.153 --> 15:50.408
Or the four of us could go do something,
and my dad could go home.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.743
Go home, Dad.
Now.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.787
Hey, I understand, Eep.

15:54.871 --> 15:55.872
You do?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.498
I understand you wanna bail

15:57.582 --> 16:00.334
'cause you're too scared
to ride a buffalippo!

16:00.418 --> 16:02.295
Joyride, joyride.

16:02.378 --> 16:07.091
[chanting]
Joyride, joyride, joyride!

16:07.175 --> 16:08.426
[sighing]

16:08.509 --> 16:10.136
- Ahem!
- Huh?

16:10.219 --> 16:11.804
Where are you going, Crood?

16:11.888 --> 16:14.098
You need to pick up your baby.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.851
Do you think I have the time
to sit around here all day?

16:16.934 --> 16:19.896
Well, yeah.
Isn't that your job?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.105
[groaning]

16:27.028 --> 16:30.615
- Dad, you forgot to pick up...
- Whoo-hoo!

16:30.698 --> 16:33.075
- Yeah, go for it!
- [cheering]

16:36.704 --> 16:38.414
- [mooing]
- Hang on, Grug!

16:38.956 --> 16:41.292
Dad, you gotta stop goofing off.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.835
- [mooing]
- [cheering]

16:44.253 --> 16:46.214
- [panting]
- [Bulk] Hang on, Grug!

16:46.297 --> 16:49.425
[sighing]
Okay, Sandy, I'll feed you.

16:49.884 --> 16:52.053
- [mooing]
- [cheering]

16:52.136 --> 16:53.721
- Whoo-hoo!
- [mooing]

16:57.016 --> 16:58.059
Again!

16:58.142 --> 16:59.185
[cheering]

17:03.397 --> 17:05.733
[straining]

17:06.526 --> 17:07.902
[grunting]

17:12.240 --> 17:13.406
See?

17:13.491 --> 17:17.787
If you took care of your teeth like I do,
then we wouldn't be here.

17:17.869 --> 17:18.869
Hm...

17:19.997 --> 17:21.790
- [cackling]
- [screaming]

17:26.087 --> 17:28.297
A-ha!
I found the troublemaker.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.800
Ah, that wasn't so bad.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.593
And now I got a new ring!

17:34.011 --> 17:35.263
See?

17:36.305 --> 17:39.684
Oh, oh, oh.
Your mouth doesn't look so good.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.018
[cackling]

17:41.102 --> 17:42.979
What are you talking about?

17:43.062 --> 17:45.398
I chew my stick after every meal.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.526
Yep, you've been taking
too much care of your teeth.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.027
You heard the man.

17:50.111 --> 17:53.030
Now get in that chair
so he can smash your face.

17:53.114 --> 17:53.948
[gasping]

17:54.031 --> 17:55.157
Hm...

17:58.035 --> 17:59.996
[cackling]

18:01.330 --> 18:02.456
[gasping]

18:03.291 --> 18:04.959
[panting]

18:05.042 --> 18:06.794
Sandy, no.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.473
Ow!

18:20.975 --> 18:22.018
Ugh!

18:24.312 --> 18:25.229
- Great.
- [chikuna squawking]

18:25.313 --> 18:28.065
Now I need to go back
and get more water.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.443
Hey, Eep,
think you can dig me out?

18:30.526 --> 18:32.820
There are a lot of worms in here.

18:32.903 --> 18:35.740
No!
I'm sick of doing everything around here.

18:35.823 --> 18:39.327
I worked all day long to bring home dinner
and take care of the baby

18:39.410 --> 18:44.665
and lug around a mouthful of water,
all while you just sat around the cave.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.752
- And you, stop running, young lady.
- [growling]

18:47.835 --> 18:50.755
Wow, Eep,
you sound just like a parent.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.298
I do not!

18:52.381 --> 18:55.593
And don't talk back to me, young man!

18:55.676 --> 18:57.178
[gasping]

18:57.261 --> 18:59.055
What have I become?

18:59.138 --> 19:02.224
[sighing]
I gotta get our real dad back.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.268
- Eep, before you go...
- [squawking]

19:06.062 --> 19:08.939
Well, at least I'm not alone right now.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.191
Right, Sandy?

19:11.567 --> 19:13.819
- Ow!
- [panting]

19:15.613 --> 19:17.323
[giggling]

19:28.292 --> 19:30.086
Grug Crood!

19:30.586 --> 19:33.964
Ooh.
Grug's in trouble.

19:34.048 --> 19:37.885
I should be the one goofing off, not you.
[sighing]

19:37.968 --> 19:40.680
Wait, are you ramu-tipping?

19:42.973 --> 19:44.725
So what if we are?

19:44.809 --> 19:47.561
You told me that was too dangerous.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.356
I'm a teenager.
I had a rough day.

19:50.439 --> 19:55.027
Late to school, sent to Deep Trouble,
got you breathing down my neck.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.821
Don't you take that tone with me.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.406
I deserve a break.

19:59.949 --> 20:03.327
[gasping] Don't you take
one more step closer to that ramu.

20:06.455 --> 20:10.126
I'm warning you,
if you so much as lay a finger...

20:10.793 --> 20:13.003
Ooh.
I'm not touching it.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.172
Whoa.
Whoa!

20:15.256 --> 20:16.424
Am I gonna touch it?

20:16.507 --> 20:17.341
I might touch it.

20:17.425 --> 20:18.926
I am gonna touch it.
I just might...

20:19.009 --> 20:19.844
- [back cracking]
- [grunts]

20:19.927 --> 20:21.345
Uh-oh.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.055
I think I just...

20:23.139 --> 20:24.557
- [back cracking]
- Yeah, yeah.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.267
I definitely threw my back out.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.935
[growling]

20:28.018 --> 20:29.770
That's a bear owl, isn't it?

20:31.230 --> 20:32.648
Okay, yes. Hi.

20:32.732 --> 20:36.485
Can I interest you
in that sleeping ramu right over...

20:36.569 --> 20:38.654
Well, I can't actually
point at it right now,

20:38.738 --> 20:40.614
but I'm pretty sure you can see it.

20:40.698 --> 20:43.200
That's it.
I'm out of the tipping game.

20:43.284 --> 20:46.454
- Run!
- Ah, don't you dare!

20:46.537 --> 20:48.956
It's time you teens
learn responsibility.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.875
But you're a teen, too.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.793
I know.
It's been a weird day.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.588
But we need to save my dad...

20:56.297 --> 20:58.674
[shrieking]

21:01.051 --> 21:04.180
by being more reckless than ever!

21:05.473 --> 21:07.224
- [roaring]
- [Sulk] Excuse me!

21:08.392 --> 21:13.814
Me and my tasty friend
want directions to the watering hole.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.984
- Is it this way...
- [growling]

21:17.067 --> 21:19.445
or is it this way?

21:20.738 --> 21:23.073
Eep, what are you doing?

21:24.074 --> 21:25.074
[gasping]

21:27.953 --> 21:28.954
[grunting]

21:29.038 --> 21:30.038
Eep?

21:31.040 --> 21:32.458
[panting]

21:38.047 --> 21:39.632
[whimpering]

21:43.344 --> 21:45.137

[grunting]

21:57.149 --> 21:58.776
[cheering]

21:58.859 --> 21:59.860
Yes!

22:01.737 --> 22:02.863
Wow.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.449
Ramu-tipping is fun
and educational.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.140
- [back cracking]
- It was fun hangin' out with you, Grug,

22:12.164 --> 22:14.542
until we remembered
you were old and lame.

22:14.625 --> 22:15.793
- See ya.
- [back cracking]

22:17.336 --> 22:20.130
Yeah, I'm done being a teen.

22:20.214 --> 22:22.258
I goofed off too much.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.386
You know what, Dad?
I think I goofed off too much too.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.471
Maybe we should both be grounded.

22:27.555 --> 22:29.723
- [chuckling]
- Yeah.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.183
Dad!

22:31.267 --> 22:32.935
Hey, fair is fair.

22:33.018 --> 22:36.480
It's not so bad.
I'm just glad to have company.

22:36.564 --> 22:39.608
- [groaning]
