WEBVTT

00:02.561 --> 00:05.229
LOUISE: Hi, everyone.
Uh, thank you for coming.

00:05.322 --> 00:07.655
I mean, you had to.
(chuckles) It's school.

00:07.733 --> 00:09.399
So, uh, here's my project.

00:09.493 --> 00:12.085
This is a plane. But don't think
of it as a plane.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.904
Think of it as a superpower.

00:13.997 --> 00:16.240
'Cause in 1920,
if you were brave enough

00:16.258 --> 00:17.665
to fly one of these things,

00:17.760 --> 00:20.001
to even go up in one,
you were kind of a superhero.

00:20.095 --> 00:22.337
WAYNE: That's true for
pretty much all new technology.

00:22.431 --> 00:24.857
-It was the same with cars.
-Oh, no talking.

00:25.008 --> 00:26.191
Thank you, Wayne.
(sighs)

00:26.418 --> 00:28.176
Okay, now you've thrown
the timing off.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.011
Resetting. Tina? Gene?

00:30.089 --> 00:31.271
TINA:
Whoops. Dropped the cloud.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.680
LOUISE: (chuckles nervously)
Um...

00:32.700 --> 00:34.033
how was everyone's Mother's Day?

00:34.260 --> 00:36.368
Did you all spend it
working on your presentations

00:36.595 --> 00:38.428
like I did?
Get your moms to help?

00:38.522 --> 00:39.763
Some present, right?

00:39.782 --> 00:42.282
The only present they got
was a present-ation.

00:42.434 --> 00:43.617
-(Rudy chuckles)
-Thanks, Rudy.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.119
You're welcome. Oh, sorry.
You said no talking.

00:46.213 --> 00:49.864
And your hero report
should be multimedia.

00:49.884 --> 00:52.109
That means multi of media.

00:52.127 --> 00:54.294
You'll have a week
to work on it. Rudy.

00:54.446 --> 00:55.870
Does it have to be
someone from history?

00:55.890 --> 00:58.799
'Cause one time I saw a guy spin
a basketball on his finger.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.118
-Uh...
-From history. You're all
about to go to the library.

01:01.136 --> 01:03.970
Your hero will be someone
in the biography section.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.381
If your hero is not
in the biography section,

01:06.400 --> 01:07.882
then they're not your hero.

01:07.976 --> 01:09.684
Let's line up.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.237
LOUISE:
So, the subject of my report

01:12.464 --> 01:14.239
gets to go on her first flight

01:14.391 --> 01:16.967
as a passenger
when she's 23 years old.

01:16.985 --> 01:18.969
And she decides
right then and there

01:19.062 --> 01:21.163
she wants to be a pilot.

01:28.314 --> 01:29.421
WAYNE:
Oh. Avoid.

01:29.648 --> 01:32.240
More of a manufactured publicity
stunt than a hero.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.668
Wayne, I have a lot of feedback
for you right now.

01:34.820 --> 01:36.320
My personal space-- invaded.

01:36.338 --> 01:38.097
Your breathing-- it's too much.

01:38.324 --> 01:39.747
And your words are bad ones.

01:39.842 --> 01:41.266
Just trying to be helpful.

01:41.418 --> 01:43.769
Wright Brothers--
they<i> invented</i> airplanes.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.679
Lindbergh is a legitimate pilot.

01:45.831 --> 01:48.756
She's a legitimate pilot.
She's sitting in an airplane

01:48.851 --> 01:50.016
-right here and...
-Yeah. Exactly.

01:50.169 --> 01:51.610
She's sitting in an airplane.

01:51.761 --> 01:53.503
For a picture. Publicity stunt.

01:53.522 --> 01:56.006
And she's on the cover
of a book that's about her.

01:56.024 --> 01:57.449
-She's...
-Jacques Cousteau. Kinda cool.

01:57.601 --> 01:59.618
He's, like,
the original Aquaman.

01:59.769 --> 02:01.361
I considered him.
Edmund Hillary--

02:01.455 --> 02:03.363
first man to reach
the top of Mount Everest.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.939
I'd let that happen. Hero-wise.

02:05.033 --> 02:07.868
Uh, this is all in
the explorer-pilot-pioneer area,

02:07.962 --> 02:09.519
if that's what
you're interested in.

02:09.613 --> 02:11.371
(sighs) I'm getting
less and less interested.

02:11.523 --> 02:13.190
Still feel pretty good
about my choice.

02:13.283 --> 02:15.783
Neil Armstrong. First man
on the moon, of course,

02:15.878 --> 02:17.210
but there's so much more there.

02:17.363 --> 02:19.120
Armstrong's grade bait, too,
you know?

02:19.140 --> 02:20.455
Automatic A-minus.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.124
Do a slideshow,
put that Ken Burns effect on,

02:23.202 --> 02:24.476
and that is an "A" all day.

02:24.628 --> 02:26.052
I'm gonna get reading.
Where are you sitting?

02:26.129 --> 02:27.312
Oh, I set up over there.

02:27.464 --> 02:28.872
Okay, good to know.
I'm going this way.

02:28.891 --> 02:30.390
Really?
Those are the worst tables here.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.193
-I don't know
if they're even level.
-Okay, thank you, Wayne!

02:35.489 --> 02:36.804
What?

02:36.899 --> 02:38.548
-OTHERS: Nothing.
-Nothing. I'm just not sure

02:38.642 --> 02:40.659
I've ever seen you with
your chin in a book like that.

02:40.810 --> 02:41.902
-Nose.
-Yeah, who knows?

02:41.996 --> 02:42.903
-What?
-What?

02:42.997 --> 02:44.312
Amelia Earhart, huh?

02:44.331 --> 02:46.239
It's for school.
I guess she's my hero?

02:46.333 --> 02:47.724
You don't sound so sure.

02:47.743 --> 02:49.817
That phrase is usually said
with more conviction.

02:49.912 --> 02:52.153
Like, "Mrs. Doubtfire
is my hero!"

02:52.173 --> 02:53.397
I didn't know who to choose.

02:53.415 --> 02:54.731
I think she's a great choice.

02:54.824 --> 02:56.082
She did...
all kinds of cool stuff.

02:56.177 --> 02:59.327
And the mystery of what happened
on her final flight.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.087
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-I haven't gotten

03:01.240 --> 03:02.255
to the end yet, so no spoilers.

03:02.408 --> 03:03.331
-Yup. Mm-hmm.
-Yup.
-Oh.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.999
What? What were you just saying?

03:05.093 --> 03:06.000
-Huh? Wha?
-I can't remember.
-Nothing.

03:06.094 --> 03:07.335
Uh, here's a spoiler--

03:07.504 --> 03:09.521
-Mother's Day is coming up.
-Aah!
-We...

03:09.690 --> 03:11.005
we-we know. Of course.

03:11.099 --> 03:13.583
We know that like... crazy.
(chuckles nervously)

03:13.677 --> 03:15.936
Anyway, headline--
don't buy me anything.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.755
Here's what I want:
in-home family spa.

03:18.848 --> 03:20.348
That's it. Nothing fancy.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.775
Just one of you rubbing my back

03:21.927 --> 03:23.535
while one of you
paints my toenails.

03:23.762 --> 03:26.205
And, also, no peeing on
the toilet seat on Mother's Day.

03:26.432 --> 03:28.114
Just for one day,
I want to not sit on pee.

03:28.267 --> 03:30.209
I-- We can do that.
I-I think we can do that.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.768
-Gene.
-Dad.

03:31.861 --> 03:35.047
LOUISE: Amelia Earhart gets
her pilot's license in 1923.

03:35.274 --> 03:37.090
In 1932, already famous

03:37.200 --> 03:39.867
but determined
to prove herself as a pioneer,

03:39.962 --> 03:42.462
she flies solo
across the Atlantic--

03:42.614 --> 03:46.132
the first woman and only the
second person ever to do this.

03:46.285 --> 03:48.042
Her most ambitious goal,
however--

03:48.062 --> 03:50.229
to be the first woman
to fly around the world--

03:50.380 --> 03:51.805
this goal,
she would never achieve.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.933
Her voice on the radio during
the final part of that journey

03:55.160 --> 03:57.569
would be the last
anyone heard from her, ever.

03:57.796 --> 03:58.904
Yeah. I know.

03:59.131 --> 04:00.964
Imagine<i> my</i> surprise
when I found that out.

04:00.983 --> 04:02.056
What?!

04:02.076 --> 04:03.091
No, Louise,

04:03.226 --> 04:04.726
you'll fall too far behind.

04:04.803 --> 04:05.969
Stick with the one you picked.

04:05.988 --> 04:07.971
Um, I'm just--
I'm not sure my hero

04:07.990 --> 04:10.156
is as heroic
as I'd like her to be.

04:10.309 --> 04:11.658
Been there. But, still, no.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.234
Great, great, great, great.

04:13.254 --> 04:14.327
What were you guys
talking about?

04:14.480 --> 04:15.328
Are you having hero trouble?

04:15.422 --> 04:16.755
Ha-ha-ha-ha. No.

04:16.982 --> 04:20.333
Actually, we're in talks
for a... sequel to my report.

04:20.486 --> 04:22.577
And franchise rights, you know?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.154
Merch. So, uh, yeah,

04:24.156 --> 04:25.913
I'm doing fine.
(chuckles)

04:25.933 --> 04:27.266
BOB:
Hey.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.175
-Cool plane.
-Yup.
-Where's a cool plane?

04:29.270 --> 04:31.252
Oh, yeah, look at that.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.013
-Pretty red.
-Yes, it's very red.

04:33.165 --> 04:34.180
I want to see something
that's red.

04:34.333 --> 04:35.181
We talking red stuff?

04:35.350 --> 04:37.183
Oh, my God, people, please.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.560
Okay. Sheesh.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.353
I'm gonna go get something red
that's nice to me.

04:40.506 --> 04:42.114
(quietly): Listen,
I have an idea for Mother's Day.

04:42.265 --> 04:43.690
Wait, why are<i> you</i> crouching?

04:43.767 --> 04:44.841
-I like it.
-Yeah.

04:44.934 --> 04:46.434
It's just now I have
to crouch lower.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.269
It's fine. Anyway,
she said she wants a massage,

04:48.289 --> 04:49.679
but we're<i> so</i> bad at that.

04:49.698 --> 04:51.014
-Yeah.
-That's true.
-Yeah.

04:51.183 --> 04:53.107
A professional massage person
is too expensive,

04:53.201 --> 04:55.777
but I found out
if you hire a massage student,

04:55.796 --> 04:57.779
it's much cheaper. Like, much.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.448
And they can come here.
So, should we surprise your mom

05:00.467 --> 05:02.801
with a real massage from someone
who's almost a professional?

05:03.028 --> 05:04.452
-That sounds nice.
-Yeah.
-Good job, Dad.

05:04.546 --> 05:06.046
-And that deep crouch, too.
-I know.

05:06.198 --> 05:07.255
Okay, then. That's the plan.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.123
Uh, hey, Lin. Uh, nice wine.

05:09.217 --> 05:10.792
-Thank... you.
-So, are you sure

05:10.811 --> 05:13.312
you don't want any help
with your homework, Louise?

05:13.463 --> 05:14.538
No, I'm fine.

05:14.556 --> 05:15.981
It doesn't matter.
She was a cool lady

05:16.208 --> 05:17.298
and then she disappeared,

05:17.392 --> 05:18.575
and I printed out
some pictures at school

05:18.577 --> 05:19.801
and I'm gonna put 'em
on something

05:19.820 --> 05:21.561
and it'll be a solid C-plus

05:21.655 --> 05:22.804
and I'm great with that.

05:22.898 --> 05:24.156
I love it.
(quietly): Okay, she's gone.

05:24.383 --> 05:26.033
-What'd you say?
-Nothing.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.718
The answer to that is five.

05:28.812 --> 05:29.977
-Five.
-Correct.

05:30.072 --> 05:31.997
-He didn't raise his hand.
-LABONZ: Geography.

05:32.224 --> 05:33.815
-What's this?
-South Ameri...
-South America.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.316
-Pretty sure.
-Correct.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.169
-But I-I said it first!
-I said it louder.

05:37.396 --> 05:38.745
You can't just say things
louder.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.246
I can. I'm doing it right now.

05:40.323 --> 05:41.989
-Well,
I'll talk louder than you.
-Talking!

05:42.084 --> 05:43.508
Talking! Loud, loud, loud!

05:43.735 --> 05:45.660
Stop making your mouth bigger!

05:45.679 --> 05:49.014
I will rip off your arms and
I will scream into your face!

05:49.165 --> 05:50.682
-Hero reports. Who's ready?
-Me!

05:50.834 --> 05:53.018
-I'm ready!
-Louise, please.
Ms. Labonz, may I present

05:53.245 --> 05:55.078
astronaut Neil Armstrong!

05:55.097 --> 05:58.081
(screaming)

05:58.100 --> 05:59.265
(panting)

05:59.360 --> 06:01.026
I got to get
a better grade than Wayne

06:01.195 --> 06:02.268
on this hero thing.

06:02.363 --> 06:04.512
And maybe remove his mouth?

06:04.590 --> 06:06.615
We'll start with the
better grade.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.597
Okay, if we make a movie,
like, a serious drama,

06:13.615 --> 06:15.615
we could use models
for the plane shots.

06:15.767 --> 06:16.933
Gene, you have model planes?

06:17.102 --> 06:18.268
Have you ever once heard me say

06:18.286 --> 06:20.361
"I'm off to work
on my model planes now"?

06:20.381 --> 06:21.863
That's fine.
We'll... figure it out.

06:21.957 --> 06:23.957
Maybe we'll do it in CG.
Tina, can you do CG?

06:24.109 --> 06:26.885
-I don't think I can...
-And, Gene,
can you be on orchestra duty?

06:27.036 --> 06:28.870
-Hiring one? Recording them?
-Um...

06:28.889 --> 06:29.963
All right. It might be hard

06:30.057 --> 06:31.539
to make a feature film
in four days.

06:31.633 --> 06:33.800
But what am I gonna do?
It has to be multimedia.

06:33.952 --> 06:35.543
-Is this multimedia?
-Uh, no.

06:35.637 --> 06:37.712
Sure, it is.
It's like a little finger puppet

06:37.731 --> 06:38.972
that can also fix your mistakes.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.123
-Ooh, puppets.
-Yes!

06:40.292 --> 06:41.066
Not finger puppets.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.550
Back in my pocket, you.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.127
Your time will come.

06:44.296 --> 06:45.904
You're, like, the puppet kid,
right, Benj?

06:46.073 --> 06:48.314
-I guess.
-So, in your expert opinion,

06:48.467 --> 06:50.967
can I put on
a grade A-caliber puppet show

06:51.060 --> 06:52.636
about Amelia Earhart
in four days?

06:52.729 --> 06:55.305
Ish? Depending on...
how you define "day."

06:55.323 --> 06:56.640
Puppets, like... puppets?

06:56.808 --> 06:59.233
-Yeah.
-These took me two weeks
to make. Each.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.477
Oh. What about marionettes?

07:00.495 --> 07:02.328
-I have marionette experience.
-Do you?

07:02.423 --> 07:04.238
And kind of shocking
natural ability?

07:04.258 --> 07:06.091
-With marionettes.
-Three weeks.

07:06.242 --> 07:07.651
Benj, you're not giving me
much here.

07:07.669 --> 07:10.429
Louise, in fifth grade,
they assign a lot more homework.

07:10.580 --> 07:12.246
I'm doing<i> this</i>
for the fifth grade play,

07:12.340 --> 07:13.748
and then my mom
drives me an hour

07:13.767 --> 07:15.992
to do after-school wheelchair
basketball twice a week,

07:16.085 --> 07:17.436
even though
I do not care for it.

07:17.587 --> 07:19.420
So maybe don't make it
like the puppet kid

07:19.514 --> 07:21.681
has to help you just 'cause
you decided this morning

07:21.833 --> 07:22.774
you wanted to do puppets.

07:23.001 --> 07:24.184
Okay, okay! Geez.

07:24.336 --> 07:25.185
Sorry. It's just...

07:25.337 --> 07:26.778
I heard you were the best.

07:27.005 --> 07:28.429
-Don't touch.
-Yup. Yup.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.598
-This room smells like paste.
-(chuckles)

07:30.692 --> 07:31.841
It's hot glue.

07:31.860 --> 07:33.452
So, you were close.
(chuckling)

07:33.528 --> 07:35.102
-Oh, hi, Ben.
-Hi!

07:35.122 --> 07:36.288
It's actually "Benj."
(chuckles softly)

07:36.515 --> 07:38.031
An eighth grade girl
knows my name.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.199
Almost knows my name.

07:39.275 --> 07:40.700
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.186
It comes with no perks
whatsoever.

07:43.188 --> 07:44.204
<i> What else can be multimedia?</i>

07:44.298 --> 07:46.447
-Interpretive dance?
-Ooh!

07:46.541 --> 07:47.299
-No.
-Oh.

07:47.526 --> 07:48.616
Oh! Slam poetry?

07:48.635 --> 07:50.360
An upright bass
playing in the background?

07:50.495 --> 07:52.362
That might at least snag you
a "B."

07:52.455 --> 07:54.881
-For "bass."
-(sighs) It's got to be an "A."

07:55.033 --> 07:55.957
Who is this kid?

07:56.125 --> 07:57.383
-(phone ringing)
-Oh! Uh, I'll get it.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.644
Yeah, it's your cell phone.
This guy, huh?

07:59.796 --> 08:00.962
-"I'll get it."
-Hi.

08:01.056 --> 08:02.706
Yes, I can totally talk to you
about that.

08:02.766 --> 08:06.226
Uh, let me just go
into the other room to, uh,

08:06.378 --> 08:08.320
check my calendar
that I have there.

08:08.396 --> 08:10.489
It-It's the exterminator.
For the restaurant.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.991
-They came last week.
-What'd I say? Exterminator?

08:13.142 --> 08:14.901
I meant the sink... examiner.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.720
-Do you mean "plumber"?
-Yup! Bye!

08:16.738 --> 08:17.904
I mean, I'll-I'll be right back.

08:18.056 --> 08:19.239
I think
plumbers make him nervous.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.648
-So cute.
-Mom, think.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.200
-Multimedia.
-Uh, glitter?

08:22.427 --> 08:24.085
-No.
-(sadly): Why no glitter?

08:32.996 --> 08:34.012
Shadow puppets.

08:34.163 --> 08:35.538
Is that a thing? Shadow puppets?

08:35.540 --> 08:36.998
-TINA/LINDA/BOB: Yeah.
-I think. Like when Dad

08:37.092 --> 08:39.075
used to make his hands
look kinda like a bird

08:39.094 --> 08:40.577
and we'd all have to be polite

08:40.595 --> 08:42.020
and say it was<i> so</i> much
like a bird.

08:42.247 --> 08:43.688
It<i> does</i> look like a bird.

08:43.765 --> 08:45.006
And I do dog, rabbit...

08:45.100 --> 08:47.433
No. Uh, I don't know.
I got to talk to Benj.

08:47.586 --> 08:49.435
The puppet kid? I thought
he was too busy to help you.

08:49.588 --> 08:52.605
Uh, actually, Tina,
<i> we</i> have to talk to Benj.

08:52.758 --> 08:54.015
Can you meet me at recess?

08:54.109 --> 08:55.425
And maybe clean the toothpaste
off your cheek.

08:55.518 --> 08:57.761
-What? (grunts)
-Aw. I liked it.

08:57.854 --> 08:59.687
Hey, Benj. How's it going?

08:59.856 --> 09:01.264
Oh! (chuckles): Hey, Tina.

09:01.283 --> 09:02.282
Didn't see you there.

09:02.434 --> 09:04.117
Benj, this is my sister Tina.

09:04.269 --> 09:05.268
She's in eighth grade.

09:05.361 --> 09:06.527
Oh. I'm aware.
(chuckles softly)

09:06.547 --> 09:08.271
Yeah,
she's an eighth grade girl.

09:08.364 --> 09:10.273
Anyway, Tina's helping me
with my report.

09:10.366 --> 09:11.883
Working closely with me,
actually.

09:12.110 --> 09:13.367
Hey, question for you
about that.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.295
Shadow puppets--
got any experience?

09:15.389 --> 09:16.054
Any advice?

09:16.281 --> 09:17.781
I've seen... some videos.

09:17.783 --> 09:19.966
It's not the kind of
puppeteering that I usually do,

09:20.060 --> 09:22.118
but I could, like, consult,
maybe?

09:22.287 --> 09:23.728
Great. What do I need?
I think I might have mentioned

09:23.880 --> 09:25.288
there's some time pressure.

09:25.381 --> 09:26.231
Uh, the report's on Monday.

09:26.458 --> 09:27.899
Wait, really? It's Thursday.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.050
It's okay. We've got this.

09:29.218 --> 09:30.293
We're a team. Right, Tina?

09:30.312 --> 09:31.644
-Right. What am I doing?
-Shh, shh.

09:31.738 --> 09:32.887
So, what would I need?

09:33.056 --> 09:35.073
Scissors, paper,
sticks, a light...

09:35.224 --> 09:37.242
-Tina, you writing this down?
-Oh, um...

09:37.393 --> 09:38.076
Mm-hmm.

09:38.227 --> 09:39.319
So, like, here?

09:39.471 --> 09:40.912
A little further back.
Is Tina coming?

09:41.064 --> 09:41.988
She's coming. For sure.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.230
That's not her. Or is it?

09:43.325 --> 09:44.749
What are you doing here?
It's lunch.

09:44.901 --> 09:46.142
I'm prepping for my report.

09:46.161 --> 09:47.085
You know Benj, right?

09:47.236 --> 09:49.070
Yeah, hi, Benj. We're old pals.

09:49.164 --> 09:50.755
Oh. Sounds like some history.

09:50.907 --> 09:52.090
I almost flunked fourth grade.

09:52.241 --> 09:53.741
-You did?
-You were fine.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.669
If only puppets could take
vocabulary quizzes, right?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.079
I'm working on one that can.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.656
Ms. Labonz,
I can hang a sheet here

09:59.749 --> 10:02.008
and project a strong light
onto it from over there, right?

10:02.160 --> 10:03.250
Uh, sure.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.994
(sucks teeth)
Seems complicated.

10:05.088 --> 10:06.663
Mine's a documentary.

10:06.681 --> 10:08.589
Plays off the laptop.
Lot of personal narrative stuff.

10:08.609 --> 10:11.258
Shots of Armstrong,
dissolve to me growing up.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.352
-You know.
-Thanks, Wayne!

10:12.428 --> 10:14.337
So glad you could stop by!

10:14.356 --> 10:15.930
I've got a secret weapon now!

10:15.949 --> 10:16.948
A shadow weapon!

10:17.175 --> 10:18.599
Hey, you must have done
this report.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.176
-Who was your hero?
-Jim Henson.

10:20.195 --> 10:21.602
So what'd you get? For a grade?

10:21.696 --> 10:23.012
-A-plus-plus?
-A "C."

10:23.106 --> 10:24.180
-Oh.
-Sorry.

10:24.199 --> 10:26.148
-But you're my... shadow weapon?
-I mean,

10:26.184 --> 10:28.852
or your unpaid,
part-time shadow consultant?

10:28.870 --> 10:30.203
Who's more into hand puppets?

10:30.355 --> 10:31.855
-Well, crap.
-LABONZ: Ugh.

10:31.873 --> 10:33.189
-This fish did not keep.
-(sniffing)

10:33.208 --> 10:34.966
-Oh, no, it didn't.
-Yeah. I can smell that...

10:39.030 --> 10:40.138
<i> BOB: Louise, remember</i>
<i> when I said you could</i>

10:40.323 --> 10:41.122
work on your project down here?

10:41.290 --> 10:42.215
Can I change my answer?

10:42.367 --> 10:43.475
No. I need the counter space.

10:43.626 --> 10:45.368
It's just... Look at Teddy.
Look at Mort.

10:45.461 --> 10:47.704
I don't mind.
It's a fun challenge to not...

10:47.797 --> 10:49.296
stain my pants too much.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.374
I heard Amelia Earhart
was actually captured

10:51.376 --> 10:53.226
by the Japanese.
Was that in the book?

10:53.378 --> 10:54.377
Oh, yeah.
There's tons of theories

10:54.396 --> 10:55.378
about what happened to her.

10:55.471 --> 10:57.063
And I go even farther than that.

10:57.215 --> 10:59.306
What if she<i> escaped</i>
from the POW camp

10:59.326 --> 11:01.642
and then she became a super spy

11:01.662 --> 11:03.328
and they gave her a super plane

11:03.555 --> 11:05.163
and the person
who sent her on missions

11:05.390 --> 11:06.739
was President Eleanor Roosevelt?

11:06.833 --> 11:08.241
-That's fun.
-I know.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.168
But just the stuff we<i> do</i> know
about is pretty great.

11:10.395 --> 11:13.487
Did I tell you my therapist has
a signed picture in her office?

11:13.507 --> 11:15.081
Her mother knew
Amelia Earhart's sister

11:15.175 --> 11:16.675
up in Medford, Massachusetts.

11:16.902 --> 11:18.084
Okay, you don't have to brag.

11:18.236 --> 11:19.493
We can't all have therapists
whose mothers

11:19.513 --> 11:21.495
are from Medford, Massachusetts,
okay?

11:21.589 --> 11:23.515
-Louise, be nice.
-Sorry, it's just, I got...

11:23.742 --> 11:25.366
9,000 puppets to cut here.

11:25.427 --> 11:27.835
Who knows what a Nazi submarine
looks like in silhouette?

11:27.929 --> 11:29.521
(quietly):
Bob, Bob, Bob.

11:29.748 --> 11:31.839
-Teddy, what?
-I have a gift basket
in my truck.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.359
Soaps, lotions, bath bubbles.

11:34.510 --> 11:36.361
It's for my mom,
but I could give it to you

11:36.512 --> 11:38.363
to give to Linda
for Mother's Day.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.256
I know that you're not great
at thoughtful gestures.

11:40.349 --> 11:42.850
We have, we have a whole thing.
It's okay. Thank you.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.761
(whispering): Some guy's
gonna come touch our mom.

11:44.779 --> 11:46.705
(whispering): We asked for
a lady, but they only had a guy.

11:46.932 --> 11:48.765
But he's "almost certified."

11:48.858 --> 11:50.542
So he's, like,
a massage enthusiast.

11:50.769 --> 11:52.435
(shushing)
She's coming.

11:52.528 --> 11:54.695
God, Mort, stop talking
about funeral home stuff.

11:54.789 --> 11:57.106
Yeah, we're not all comfortable
with death like you.

11:57.125 --> 11:58.942
-What?
-Oh, Mort.

11:58.944 --> 12:00.777
-What is it?
-It's a pedal board.

12:00.795 --> 12:03.112
-So instead of the keyboard
sounding like this...
-(note drones)

12:03.206 --> 12:04.538
-...it sounds like this.
-(blipping echoes)

12:04.558 --> 12:06.373
Love it. It's in.
Where'd you get it?

12:06.393 --> 12:08.284
Peter Pescadero.
His brother plays guitar,

12:08.377 --> 12:09.969
but his brother is
away at college.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.971
Peter said I could use it
if I teach him how to twerk.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.381
Also Peter said he can
come play his bass recorder

12:14.476 --> 12:16.642
along with me if I only play
in the key of F,

12:16.737 --> 12:19.629
which is okay 'cause "key" is
just an attitude, I think.

12:19.647 --> 12:21.740
-What's this?
-Soviet plane-fighting robot.

12:21.891 --> 12:23.649
Did Amelia Earhart, um,

12:23.802 --> 12:26.135
-do fights with Soviet robots?
-She might have.

12:26.229 --> 12:28.747
-Ooh, I've got
a good effect for that.
-(effect zapping)

12:28.898 --> 12:30.656
Louise, do you have
maybe too much

12:30.809 --> 12:32.233
in the super spy section?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.310
I think I have just the
right amount, thanks for asking.

12:34.403 --> 12:35.828
Cut a little faster, maybe?

12:35.981 --> 12:37.738
Well, do you say
why she's your hero?

12:37.758 --> 12:41.651
I mean, even if she didn't
become a secret super spy?

12:41.744 --> 12:43.319
Yeah, yeah, that's in there.

12:43.338 --> 12:46.431
It's called the "My Hero"
project, so of course I...

12:46.658 --> 12:48.157
get into... all that.

12:48.251 --> 12:50.176
-Tina. Duh.
-Sorry.

12:50.328 --> 12:51.828
Nothing! I've got nothing!

12:51.921 --> 12:54.421
I wrote a whole stupid story
about super spies and robots.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.609
I'm gonna get an "F"
and smug Wayne will be

12:57.760 --> 12:59.669
smug and kind of right.

12:59.762 --> 13:01.170
-Aah!
-Okay. It's okay.

13:01.189 --> 13:02.355
We can figure this out.

13:02.507 --> 13:04.023
It's just...

13:04.175 --> 13:05.784
I hate that she failed.
I hate it.

13:06.011 --> 13:07.343
And the more
I read that chapter,

13:07.362 --> 13:09.195
the more it was like--
it was her fault.

13:09.347 --> 13:10.680
<i> It was so badly planned.</i>

13:10.698 --> 13:12.849
<i> They didn't bring</i>
<i> the right kind of radio.</i>

13:12.867 --> 13:15.368
And Wayne's gonna be sitting
there with his dumb face

13:15.520 --> 13:18.037
and his successful
moon-landing man report.

13:18.189 --> 13:19.613
Hey. Forget about Wayne.

13:19.707 --> 13:21.207
Wayne can go... kiss a kickball.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.468
Maybe you can cut the spy stuff?

13:23.545 --> 13:26.212
Maybe just write an ending
where nothing happened,

13:26.364 --> 13:29.456
except what's most likely,
which is that she went down

13:29.476 --> 13:31.701
in the Pacific Ocean
and they never found

13:31.719 --> 13:33.369
her body or her plane.

13:33.462 --> 13:34.887
Yeah, that sounds
like a crowd pleaser.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.889
Well, better than that,
but let's just try

13:36.983 --> 13:38.374
and see
what that would look like.

13:38.467 --> 13:41.135
It would just be
rewriting this much, right?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.153
-And then the next page.
-Oh.

13:42.380 --> 13:43.470
And the one after that.

13:43.639 --> 13:45.490
Oh, okay, but still,
we-we can do this.

13:45.717 --> 13:48.309
Uh, let me get you
fresh paper and a pencil.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.162
-Do kids still use pencils?
-Yeah.

14:04.085 --> 14:05.659
BOB: All right,
your mom's still asleep,

14:05.753 --> 14:08.237
or she's pretending to be
asleep, I can't tell.

14:08.256 --> 14:10.406
How-how are you, um... doing?

14:10.408 --> 14:12.166
With my report? Horrible.

14:12.260 --> 14:13.926
I know it's Mother's Day, so...

14:14.020 --> 14:16.170
-I'll just stop.
-You can keep working on it
after breakfast.

14:16.264 --> 14:18.189
LOUISE: Well, I'm not gonna
ruin Mother's Day and fail,

14:18.266 --> 14:20.600
-so I might as well
just do the failing part.
-(doorbell rings)

14:20.752 --> 14:23.010
Oh, no! You weren't supposed
to ring the doorbell.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.604
Hello. I'm Pat.

14:24.756 --> 14:25.771
-Shh!
-Oh. Sorry.

14:25.924 --> 14:26.772
Wait, what's going on?

14:26.925 --> 14:28.182
Pat. You're a surprise.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.259
I'm a surprise like
what am I doing at your door?

14:30.278 --> 14:32.261
No, I-I mean,
I was thinking I'd try to...

14:32.430 --> 14:34.280
sneak you in and surprise
my wife with you.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.264
Oh, fun.

14:35.358 --> 14:36.432
(whispers):
I mean, fun.

14:36.451 --> 14:38.543
(both grunting)

14:40.529 --> 14:42.622
Ah, don't make
so much noise, Gene.

14:42.774 --> 14:45.274
Your-your mother's sleeping.
Shh.

14:45.368 --> 14:46.609
Oh, smart.

14:46.628 --> 14:47.793
But now you have
to pretend you have a son

14:47.888 --> 14:49.387
named Gene
for the rest of your life.

14:49.538 --> 14:52.281
What? No, I really have
a son named Gene.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.434
Uh-oh. Losing my grip.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.621
-Uh, surprise.
-Happy Mother's Day.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.456
-Happy Mother's Day.
-Happy Mother's Day.

15:00.549 --> 15:02.458
Thank you?

15:02.551 --> 15:04.885
Hi. Come on over
and we'll get you comfortable.

15:04.979 --> 15:06.738
I'm totally comfortable.
Too comfortable maybe.

15:06.889 --> 15:09.148
-Not really.
-I'll step out
and you can remove your robe

15:09.300 --> 15:11.467
and lie down on your stomach,
with your face here.

15:11.560 --> 15:12.468
Hmm.

15:12.561 --> 15:14.153
-Hi.
-ALL: Hi.

15:14.305 --> 15:16.822
This is everyone's
first massage, I'm gathering?

15:16.917 --> 15:18.324
-Why do you say that?
-'Cause we look like

15:18.476 --> 15:19.809
we think you're gonna
murder our mom?

15:19.902 --> 15:21.978
We always look like that.
Don't be offended.

15:22.071 --> 15:24.255
(Linda humming)

15:26.409 --> 15:27.333
-Oh.
-What?!

15:27.427 --> 15:29.243
Your back, it's... so tight.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.911
Were you in an accident?

15:31.038 --> 15:31.930
-No.
-Really?

15:32.081 --> 15:33.414
Did you just wake up
from a coma?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.934
No. Is it possible
it's just from my life?

15:36.161 --> 15:37.751
-Wow. Bob?
-Yeah?

15:37.771 --> 15:39.253
We're gonna need
more than an hour.

15:39.347 --> 15:41.330
Uh, for the same money?

15:41.349 --> 15:42.665
Oh. Oh, yes.

15:42.684 --> 15:44.776
This will be a great
learning experience for me.

15:44.927 --> 15:46.852
Most people don't have this.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.522
What a strange,
unique challenge.

15:49.691 --> 15:50.856
Can I get on your Wi-Fi?

15:50.951 --> 15:52.525
I might need
to watch some videos.

15:52.677 --> 15:54.860
LOUISE: Ugh, that's it.
I give up. I give up!

15:55.013 --> 15:57.196
You win, Wayne,
you big-mouthed bastard!

15:57.365 --> 15:59.732
-Aah!
-Okay. Tense.

15:59.884 --> 16:02.609
Tense house. The knots are...
making more sense.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.672
LOUISE: Stupid! Dumb!
Hate it! Hate it. (shouting)

16:09.952 --> 16:12.044
Nothing.
No ship, no Howland Island.

16:12.197 --> 16:13.713
No land of any kind.

16:13.865 --> 16:16.882
They were exactly where
they weren't supposed to be,

16:17.035 --> 16:18.292
over the open ocean,

16:18.311 --> 16:21.312
with nothing but fumes
left in the gas tanks...

16:21.464 --> 16:23.464
LOUISE:
I don't even want to do the...

16:23.558 --> 16:25.057
(shouting indistinctly)

16:25.134 --> 16:26.542
...and just disappear, too!

16:26.561 --> 16:28.653
I'll go check on Louise
and see why she's yelling.

16:28.763 --> 16:31.155
-And... banging.
-LINDA: Bob, bring her in here.

16:31.382 --> 16:32.973
No, Lin.
This is your special treat.

16:33.067 --> 16:34.158
We want you to relax.

16:34.310 --> 16:35.493
I'm not gonna be able to relax

16:35.720 --> 16:37.069
unless she's in here
and I can talk to her.

16:37.222 --> 16:39.388
-It's not quite what I would...
-It's okay.

16:39.482 --> 16:40.573
Mom, it's fine.

16:40.725 --> 16:43.150
I didn't mean to make...
so much noise.

16:43.244 --> 16:44.744
Just pretend I said, "Wee!"

16:44.838 --> 16:46.729
-Okay?
-Aw, my baby, I can help you.

16:46.822 --> 16:48.506
-I had a thought.
-You did?

16:48.733 --> 16:50.416
Yeah. Oh! Oh! Oh-ooh!

16:50.568 --> 16:53.177
I'm listening when you're done
making that sound.

16:53.404 --> 16:55.996
LOUISE: When they realized
just how bad things were,

16:56.090 --> 16:58.516
Amelia and her navigator
must have talked.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.501
But what is there to say?

17:00.595 --> 17:02.002
"Oops"? I imagine

17:02.022 --> 17:04.247
that she made a graceful landing
on the water.

17:04.340 --> 17:06.006
I imagine that they...

17:06.100 --> 17:08.251
climbed out up onto
the nose of the plane.

17:08.269 --> 17:11.696
I imagine the plane
was sinking, but not quickly.

17:11.923 --> 17:13.698
The body of it
would fill with water,

17:13.925 --> 17:16.016
and slowly become too heavy
for the empty gas tanks

17:16.036 --> 17:17.943
in the wings to hold up
on the surface.

17:18.038 --> 17:21.522
And I picture Amelia
really facing her fate.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.599
No planes in the sky.

17:23.692 --> 17:25.601
No ships on the horizon.

17:25.620 --> 17:27.045
And she would have known.

17:27.272 --> 17:29.363
Soon, she'd be treading water.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.791
The great flier is now
a floater.

17:31.885 --> 17:32.958
Fish food.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.460
-(Wayne laughs)
-Wayne, zip it.

17:34.612 --> 17:36.946
I was thinking
about Amelia Earhart's mother.

17:36.964 --> 17:38.464
-Since it's Mother's Day.
-Yeah?

17:38.558 --> 17:40.058
You know what
I bet she never said

17:40.209 --> 17:41.059
-to her daughter?
-What?

17:41.210 --> 17:42.376
-Act like a lady.
-Gross.

17:42.470 --> 17:43.969
I know,
but back when she was a kid,

17:44.122 --> 17:46.064
women weren't doing things
that men did,

17:46.215 --> 17:48.715
like flying planes
or wearing pants.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.476
And I bet she never said, "Ooh!

17:50.570 --> 17:52.070
Girls can do anything
boys can do."

17:52.297 --> 17:55.298
'Cause, you know, sometimes
when they say that, it...

17:55.466 --> 17:57.617
It ends up sounding
like the opposite?

17:57.802 --> 17:59.135
Yeah. You never said it to me.

17:59.228 --> 18:00.970
It never came up. Oh!

18:00.988 --> 18:03.139
-Oh-oof!
-Sorry. Too much pressure?

18:03.232 --> 18:04.490
No, no, I like it. Ooh!

18:04.567 --> 18:06.142
I'm gonna write
some of this down.

18:06.235 --> 18:08.160
However she did it,
whatever she said--

18:08.313 --> 18:10.237
Amelia Earhart's mom--
it worked.

18:10.331 --> 18:11.664
She had a confident daughter.

18:11.816 --> 18:13.758
-Exhale.
-Ooh! That's good.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.818
-Thank you.
-(sighs) I feel awful for her.

18:15.837 --> 18:17.336
Losing her daughter like that.

18:17.488 --> 18:19.430
But, you know, her daughter
was doing what she loved to do.

18:19.582 --> 18:22.600
And Amelia was so confident,
and she did all this stuff.

18:22.827 --> 18:23.935
And then a lot of little girls

18:24.162 --> 18:25.770
saw themselves
doing all sorts of stuff.

18:25.921 --> 18:28.180
-Hoo! Hoo-ah!
-Sorry.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.182
No, it's good. So, in a way...

18:30.335 --> 18:33.093
Amelia's mom gave me
a huge gift.

18:33.187 --> 18:35.929
That because of her daughter,
my daughter gets a glimpse

18:35.949 --> 18:38.674
of this fantastic life--
(gurgling)

18:38.767 --> 18:40.343
-You're drooling.
-Am I?

18:40.511 --> 18:41.452
Yes. Very much.

18:41.604 --> 18:42.361
That's a compliment...

18:42.513 --> 18:43.788
to a massage therapist, I think.

18:44.015 --> 18:45.772
Should I get a towel
or a mop or something?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.608
No, no, come back.
I can't see you.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.609
I won't drool anymore.

18:48.686 --> 18:49.961
-Okay...
-Hey.

18:50.188 --> 18:51.462
Heroes don't have to be perfect.

18:51.614 --> 18:52.613
You know?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.690
They just have
to make you think bigger

18:54.709 --> 18:55.967
about yourself somehow.

18:56.194 --> 18:57.635
(grunts) Sorry.

18:57.786 --> 18:59.195
-Little more drool.
-Aah! Aah!

18:59.213 --> 19:01.697
LOUISE: Amelia Earhart
didn't fly around the world.

19:01.716 --> 19:04.291
And some people may
think that makes her a failure.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.385
And those people
might say that loudly,

19:06.479 --> 19:08.371
while standing next to you
with hot breath.

19:08.464 --> 19:10.481
And sometimes,
yeah, people with louder,

19:10.633 --> 19:13.151
deeper voices get heard more
and that's really annoying,

19:13.319 --> 19:16.487
but that doesn't make me want to
make my voice lower and deeper.

19:16.714 --> 19:18.881
That just makes me mad.
I mean, I can do it.

19:18.900 --> 19:20.324
(deep voice):
"Hey, I'm Louise."

19:20.551 --> 19:21.492
(normal voice):
See? Pretty good.

19:21.644 --> 19:22.568
But that's not the point.

19:22.720 --> 19:23.494
Look what Earhart did.

19:23.687 --> 19:24.996
She saved her money

19:25.223 --> 19:26.647
and she bought her bright red

19:26.666 --> 19:28.166
Lockheed Vega.

19:28.393 --> 19:29.816
That was her saying, "Hello.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.869
This is what
my voice sounds like."

19:32.096 --> 19:33.062
(effect warbling)

19:33.080 --> 19:35.989
That thing had
a 450-horsepower engine.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.067
That basically means
an engine as strong

19:38.160 --> 19:41.570
and as loud
as 450 horses mushed together.

19:41.589 --> 19:43.088
And it could fly.

19:43.165 --> 19:45.741
If you wrote a book
and you invented this character,

19:45.834 --> 19:47.910
this dashing lady pilot,

19:47.929 --> 19:49.670
you might become
a famous author.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.522
Well, she was that character.

19:51.749 --> 19:53.098
She wrote herself.

19:53.175 --> 19:55.434
Okay, so we know
what probably happened.

19:55.586 --> 19:57.010
But who knows, right?

19:57.030 --> 19:59.030
When you're that far out in
the world, there's more magic.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.699
That's true. It's like that
in the North Pole...

20:01.850 --> 20:04.427
and in the jungles.
Maybe after she made her peace,

20:04.520 --> 20:07.279
just before she got
too tired to keep afloat,

20:07.432 --> 20:10.266
maybe some of that magic
lifted that plane

20:10.284 --> 20:11.709
right back up underneath her.

20:11.860 --> 20:13.285
And maybe she got to fly it back

20:13.438 --> 20:15.788
up into the air and maybe
she never had to land again.

20:15.957 --> 20:17.548
Maybe she dropped
Fred Noonan off

20:17.700 --> 20:19.199
in Navigator Heaven
and then kept going.

20:19.277 --> 20:22.202
I like to think of her flying
around up there right now.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.371
She makes me want
to write a story for myself

20:24.465 --> 20:27.299
that's as big
and as fricking cool as hers.

20:27.468 --> 20:30.877
So that's why Amelia Earhart
is my hero.

20:30.972 --> 20:32.212
Wow.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.065
-Yay!
-That was good.

20:34.292 --> 20:35.399
And it's not a contest,
but I think

20:35.551 --> 20:36.901
that's better
than a male astronaut.

20:37.128 --> 20:38.461
Okay, who's up next?

20:38.479 --> 20:39.886
-Is it Wayne?
-LABONZ: Yeah, it's Wayne.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.054
