WEBVTT

00:25.066 --> 00:26.067
Wow.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.154
Jamie?

00:29.154 --> 00:31.489
Oh, my God, Robin!

00:31.489 --> 00:34.451
Oh, God, look at you, baby. Oh!

00:34.451 --> 00:37.328
- You haven't aged a day.
- Look at me? Look at you!

00:37.328 --> 00:40.165
Oh, God, please.
It's just Spanx and lipstick.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.501
Can you believe all this?

00:44.002 --> 00:46.713
Look at that.
They even got that nasty old rug right.

00:46.713 --> 00:50.759
Do you remember how many times
Scotty's dog peed on that rug?

00:50.759 --> 00:53.511
I think Scotty peed on it a few times.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.266
It feels like another lifetime, huh?

01:01.311 --> 01:03.271
<i>And now, please welcome to the stage,</i>

01:03.271 --> 01:06.483
America's favorite neighbor, Jamie Yao!

01:10.111 --> 01:13.073
There he is. Looking sharp.

01:13.656 --> 01:15.992
They love ya. Soak it up.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.122
- It's great to see you, Jamie.
- Good to be here.

01:21.122 --> 01:24.542
But, I have to say, you look different.
Are you forgetting something?

01:25.960 --> 01:27.545
N-No. I d-- I don't think so.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.799
Does that jog your memory? Huh?

01:30.799 --> 01:32.050
Look familiar?

01:32.050 --> 01:34.427
- You gotta put it on.
- Come on. Put it on.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.847
- Yeah! Put it on!
- Yeah.

01:37.847 --> 01:40.058
Yeah!

01:41.518 --> 01:44.813
So, Jamie, 30 years ago, you introduced us

01:44.813 --> 01:48.399
to one of the most iconic characters
in television history.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.237
Thank you. Thank you. That's very kind.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.365
And now, there's rumors
that he may be coming back.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.784
Thanks, in part,
to your newfound popularity online.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.036
I have to admit, I'm not on social media.

02:00.662 --> 02:05.333
Well, I am, and you are one of the top
trending memes of the year.

02:05.333 --> 02:06.501
Oh. Is that a good thing?

02:06.501 --> 02:08.169
Is that--

02:08.169 --> 02:10.588
Here, you can see for yourself.
Let's take a look!

02:14.092 --> 02:15.718
<i>What could go Wong?</i>

02:19.806 --> 02:21.349
<i>What could go Wong?</i>

02:25.228 --> 02:27.939
<i>What could go Wong?</i>

02:32.360 --> 02:33.820
<i>What could go Wong?</i>

02:37.907 --> 02:40.827
Classic stuff, right? Come on.
Good stuff.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.705
Tell us, Jamie, what was it like

02:43.705 --> 02:47.959
playing such an unforgettable role
for so many years?

03:00.763 --> 03:03.266
Okay, dude, I'm just gonna ask.
Who was that guy?

03:03.266 --> 03:05.185
He's the one attempting the uprising.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.979
My father's enemy. The Bull Demon.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.607
That's his name? The Bull Demon?

03:10.607 --> 03:13.818
Yeah, and now he has the Iron Staff.
He's more dangerous than ever.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.779
I can't believe this whole thing's
over my parents' pendant.

03:16.779 --> 03:19.073
That's what he wants
in return for my father,

03:19.616 --> 03:22.952
but if I give it to him, then it's over.
Heaven will lose the war.

03:23.661 --> 03:24.871
Yeah, but...

03:26.706 --> 03:27.707
it's your dad.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.382
We need to see Guanyin.
She'll know what to do next.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.592
Okay.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.177
We're walking?

03:39.177 --> 03:40.511
Okay, we're walking.

03:47.518 --> 03:49.270
I bet that's pretty painful.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.483
That glass shard was forged in Diyu,
the underworld.

03:54.192 --> 03:59.906
The longer it remains in you,
the more it pulls your soul apart.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.992
I thought you wanted an uprising.

04:04.577 --> 04:09.290
Not just--
Not just to settle some old score.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.668
Hey, why not both?

04:11.668 --> 04:14.963
You have the staff. Isn't that enough?

04:19.133 --> 04:21.719
Oh, it's enough. You'll see.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.930
One more day.

04:26.015 --> 04:29.310
Mowang, don't do this.
This isn't who you are.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.987
You don't get to tell me who I am.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.074
You have no idea who I am.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.683
Guanyin-<i>pusa</i>.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.728
Guanyin-<i>pusa</i>, something happened.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.023
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your friend?

05:15.023 --> 05:17.442
Oh, sorry. This is Jin.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.777
Uh, hi. I'm Jin.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.490
It's nice to finally meet you.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.076
- Would you like some tea?
- Uh, no, thanks.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.621
I meant, I would love some tea.
Thank you very much.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.294
Okay, continue.

05:36.294 --> 05:39.797
So, we were with some friends
when Ji Gong and Niu Mowang attacked.

05:39.797 --> 05:43.885
My father appears and there is a fight.
Niu Mowang stabbed him and took him.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.180
He said I have only one day
to bring him the Fourth Scroll.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.974
So, where's the pendant? We need it.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.768
I'm afraid that won't help you either.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.688
It turns out
the pendant is not the Fourth Scroll.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.233
But the prophecy, though.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.277
The stones.

06:01.277 --> 06:04.113
But that's all they were. Stones.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.576
W-- But-- But the bad guys
don't know that, right?

06:08.576 --> 06:11.162
So we can still use it
to get your dad back.

06:11.162 --> 06:13.414
- We just do the abracadabra thing again.
- Yeah!

06:13.414 --> 06:16.584
Unfortunately,
I no longer have the pendant.

06:16.584 --> 06:17.668
Where is it?

06:18.836 --> 06:19.837
A dog ate it.

06:21.297 --> 06:24.008
- What?
- It was a weird day.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.427
Then we must call for help.

06:26.427 --> 06:29.389
Pigsy, Sandy and Nezha.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.265
Wei-Chen,
they are needed in Heaven

06:31.265 --> 06:34.394
to protect the Jade Emperor
from the allies of Niu Mowang.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.563
We have to do something.
You said you would support me.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.527
And I have.

06:43.945 --> 06:47.281
I supported your quest
to follow your dreams.

06:47.281 --> 06:50.201
I never promised
that they would come true.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.245
Not all dreams do.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.584
It's time for us to go home.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.129
And, Jin,

07:02.213 --> 07:03.756
you should go home too.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.844
Wait, but, uh, what about his dad

07:07.844 --> 07:10.138
and all the stuff that's going on
up in Heaven?

07:11.639 --> 07:13.808
You've got to let me help.
Please, I want to help.

07:16.519 --> 07:17.687
No, Jin.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.648
She's right.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.608
It's too dangerous.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.528
Thank you.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.656
You were a good guide.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.289
No, I wasn't.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.417
I didn't guide you to anything.

07:43.337 --> 07:44.380
Sorry, Wei-Chen.

07:46.674 --> 07:47.675
Hey.

07:48.676 --> 07:49.677
Here.

07:50.928 --> 07:52.346
Don't forget your birthday gift.

07:55.516 --> 07:56.559
Thanks, Wei-Chen.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.804
Mowang may be lost forever,

08:35.056 --> 08:36.224
but you aren't.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.561
Help me escape and I'll bring you back.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.540
Wei-Chen, are you ready?

09:01.082 --> 09:02.375
I'm staying.

09:03.292 --> 09:07.129
With or without the Fourth Scroll,
I will rescue my father.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.509
You remind me so much of him.

09:13.177 --> 09:15.054
So sure of yourself.

09:17.014 --> 09:20.184
But confidence can be
a dangerous thing too.

09:21.310 --> 09:24.230
Guanyin-<i>pusa</i>, I believe in my dream.

09:25.356 --> 09:28.609
I believe the answer will reveal itself
when I need it.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.654
If you choose this path,

09:32.905 --> 09:34.282
you do it alone.

09:40.871 --> 09:44.458
Do you think anyone in heaven
would want that coffee table?

09:45.042 --> 09:47.461
Don't answer that.

10:17.992 --> 10:18.993
- Jin-<i>ah</i>.
- Mmm?

10:18.993 --> 10:21.245
Daddy's gonna pick you up
from school today.

10:21.245 --> 10:24.540
- Okay, why?
- I'm going to visit Elaine <i>Ayí</i>.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.751
- Auntie Elaine in Sacramento?
- Mmm.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.378
- For how long?
- Couple days.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.590
Okay. Is she, like, sick or something?

10:32.590 --> 10:35.092
No, nothing like that. She's fine.

10:36.886 --> 10:40.264
I left some fried rice and vegetables
in the fridge.

10:40.264 --> 10:43.434
- Heat it up if you get hungry, huh?
- Yeah, got it.

10:45.895 --> 10:49.357
- And don't forget. Trash, Monday.
- Mmm.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.862
I thought you said you were only gonna be
gone for a couple of days.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.912
- Mom, what's going on?
- Hmm?

11:05.539 --> 11:08.542
I just need some time, that's all.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.924
- Are you and Dad splitting up?
-<i>Aiya</i>.

11:15.841 --> 11:18.594
Don't make such a fuss before school.

11:18.594 --> 11:20.137
It's not good for you, huh?

11:35.111 --> 11:39.281
Jin, guess what?
Brendan got food poisoning last night.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.576
- Well, is he okay?
- He'll be fine. It's just toilet stuff.

11:42.576 --> 11:47.123
The point is he's out a few days,
so you're starting at midfield tomorrow.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.457
Tomorrow?

11:49.291 --> 11:52.211
Osito Valley?
Our biggest game of the season?

11:52.211 --> 11:53.629
Right! Right. Yeah.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.340
I gotta say,
I thought you'd be more excited.

11:56.340 --> 12:00.261
Yeah, sorry, yes, sir. I am.
I haven't gotten very much sleep lately.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.012
Me neither. This is a big one.

12:02.012 --> 12:05.057
Get your head right, Wang.
I need you ready.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.567
- Oh, hey!
- Hey!

12:14.567 --> 12:17.987
Everyone's still talking about your party.
Maybe we could make it a regular thing.

12:18.946 --> 12:21.282
- My birthday?
- No, bowling.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.617
- Oh, right.
- Are you okay?

12:23.617 --> 12:27.371
Yeah, sorry.
Or-- Uh-- [chuckles] I don't know, maybe.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.916
Hey, seriously, is everything okay?

12:31.542 --> 12:33.377
It's just, my parents are--

12:34.211 --> 12:37.173
Sorry. Um...

12:37.798 --> 12:40.301
My parents, this morning--

12:40.301 --> 12:43.220
Let's go! Osito Valley's going down!

12:43.220 --> 12:44.513
Whoo!

12:45.473 --> 12:47.725
My mom was--
She was giving me a ride to school

12:47.725 --> 12:50.227
and we were talking and--
she's trying to start a new business--

12:50.227 --> 12:51.645
but she was talking about...

12:51.645 --> 12:55.649
- Up top! Whoo! That's the spirit.
- My mom is-- Like, she's trying to--

12:55.649 --> 12:58.819
- Dude, watch it!
- Oh, sorry, bud. High five.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.821
- Boop.
- Dude!

13:01.822 --> 13:03.240
- Jin!
- Dude, what's your deal?

13:03.240 --> 13:04.700
Hey! Hey!

13:04.700 --> 13:06.911
God, what the heck?

13:06.911 --> 13:10.539
Watch that. Are you okay? Are you okay?

13:10.539 --> 13:11.707
Yeah.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.502
My office. Now.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.339
Okay. Up we go.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.058
All right.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.487
Hey.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.906
- <i>Hey. Have you seen it yet?</i>
- Seen what?

13:43.906 --> 13:46.700
You're-- You're on TV.
I just sent it to you. Click the link.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.167
<i>What could go Wong?</i>

13:59.171 --> 14:00.422
<i>What could go Wong?</i>

14:02.675 --> 14:06.220
<i>Tell us, Jamie, what was it like</i>

14:06.220 --> 14:10.015
<i>playing such an unforgettable role
for so many years?</i>

14:12.101 --> 14:14.687
You know, uh, in those days,

14:14.687 --> 14:17.022
people who look like me
weren't on television.

14:17.022 --> 14:20.818
So I'm very grateful for the opportunity.
I still am.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.112
I mean, Freddy Wong bought me a duplex.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.408
You became a landlord? That's ironic.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.577
Is that why you walked away from acting?

14:30.160 --> 14:31.996
I actually bought it for my parents.

14:31.996 --> 14:35.624
But I didn't walk away from acting.
I just walked away from Hollywood.

14:35.624 --> 14:38.085
Interesting. And why's that?

14:38.669 --> 14:40.296
Well, after the show ended,

14:40.296 --> 14:43.132
I thought, you know, a lot
of opportunities would have opened up,

14:43.132 --> 14:45.134
just like the way it did
for a lot of people.

14:45.134 --> 14:49.680
Yeah. The industry can be hard
on everyone.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.016
Sweetie, I think he was talking about us.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.602
No, no. [chuckles] It's not just you.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.813
It's the whole system.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.942
The only parts that I got offered
were nerds and neighbors.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.904
And, sometimes, ninjas.

15:06.363 --> 15:09.408
And what kinds of roles
were you looking for at the time?

15:10.242 --> 15:12.953
I mean, I wanted to play the hero.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.748
It's every kid's dream, right?

15:15.748 --> 15:18.709
So you're saying the people at <i>Batman</i>
never called?

15:19.793 --> 15:23.839
You know, I-- I teach
classical theater to college kids,

15:23.839 --> 15:26.300
and-- and we talk about character a lot.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.511
When I say I wanted to play a hero,

15:30.387 --> 15:34.767
I mean I just wanted to be someone
who goes on a journey.

15:35.726 --> 15:38.020
Shows some courage. Helps others.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.524
A hero can be a person with superpowers

15:43.817 --> 15:46.362
or they can just be--

15:47.237 --> 15:49.698
can be someone who fights
for something that matters.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.205
My parents were heroes.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.835
But as I said,
people like that weren't on TV back then.

16:06.674 --> 16:10.219
Well, hopefully that's changing.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.389
I hope so.

16:14.473 --> 16:17.810
And I hope that there's a kid out there
watching this

16:18.310 --> 16:20.437
who feels he doesn't have to be
a punch line.

16:21.689 --> 16:25.818
Who believes that he can be the hero.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.320
Jin.

16:34.785 --> 16:38.247
Mr. and Mrs. Wang, thank you for coming.
Shall we?

16:42.501 --> 16:46.672
As I mentioned on the phone, this is
Jin's second altercation this year.

16:46.672 --> 16:50.926
Uh, a couple of weeks ago, he tackled
a fellow member of the soccer team.

16:50.926 --> 16:54.304
We are very sorry about that.
It is not like our son.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.140
Well, you know, in my experience,

16:56.140 --> 16:59.518
these kinds of incidents tend to indicate
something going on at home.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.770
So have there been any recent changes?

17:01.770 --> 17:04.148
No. Everything's normal.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.276
Okay. Well, that's good to hear.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.029
Maybe it's because Jin is having puberty?

17:10.029 --> 17:12.072
- Mom.
- You are. It's okay.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.533
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. Cou-- Could be hormonal.

17:14.533 --> 17:19.788
Um, correct me if I'm wrong, Mrs. Wang,
but you spend a lot of time with Jin.

17:19.788 --> 17:21.707
- Is that right?
- Yes.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.793
Um, because I recently read a book
about how parents,

17:24.793 --> 17:28.172
particularly mothers
within your community, tend to operate.

17:28.172 --> 17:34.887
So, do you think that maybe, um,
Jin is crying out for more affection?

17:34.887 --> 17:36.096
I'm sorry?

17:36.096 --> 17:39.725
I just think that kids like Jin, you know,

17:39.725 --> 17:43.145
might be starved
for more positive reinforcement.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.772
Kids like Jin?

17:44.772 --> 17:49.234
I also read that, um, families like yours
are very achievement-based,

17:49.234 --> 17:52.821
which is good, it's very good,
up to a point.

17:53.405 --> 17:54.948
- I'm sorry, I'm confused.
- Mom.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.366
- Yeah-- You can--
- He--

17:56.366 --> 17:59.078
You know what?
This-- This is good.

17:59.078 --> 18:03.791
This is, um, a wonderful opportunity
for us to P.L.O.T. together.

18:03.791 --> 18:04.875
Can we try that?

18:04.875 --> 18:06.794
- Plot?
- Yeah, P.L.O.T.

18:06.794 --> 18:10.964
It is a cultural sensitivity strategy
that I recently picked up at a conference.

18:10.964 --> 18:16.804
So, um-- "Pay attention.
Look for nonverbal cues." Right?

18:16.804 --> 18:20.099
"Offer feedback. Take turns responding."

18:20.099 --> 18:21.725
P.L.O.T. It's very fun.

18:21.725 --> 18:24.812
Principal Kinney,
I give Jin a lot of attention

18:24.812 --> 18:28.357
and I also push him,
and I think it's a good balance.

18:28.357 --> 18:31.068
Well, Mrs. Wang, um, with all due respect,

18:31.068 --> 18:34.905
I don't think that it is a good balance
because your son is acting out.

18:34.905 --> 18:38.575
- But, sometimes, kids act out, so--
- I'm just trying to--

18:39.493 --> 18:43.330
I'm just trying to get to the bottom
of what is actually going on here.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.084
Jin's a teenager.
I think that's what's going on. And--

18:47.084 --> 18:51.004
- This feels different.
- Because our son is different.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.343
Because our family is different.

19:00.013 --> 19:04.017
My wife is tough on my son
because she believes in him.

19:05.269 --> 19:08.355
She pushes him
because she knows he can take it.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.860
We are achievement-based
because we have to be.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.989
I'm not defending Jin's behavior.

19:18.365 --> 19:23.954
But, yes, we are dealing
with some issues at home.

19:27.416 --> 19:31.086
And, I'm sorry,
but your books and your card...

19:31.753 --> 19:33.881
...has nothing to do with us.

19:35.048 --> 19:40.053
And, you should know, my wife is
the best mother you will ever meet.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.306
Mr. Wang, I'm--

19:42.306 --> 19:44.433
If you were really paying attention,

19:44.433 --> 19:46.727
you would know
our last name is not "Wang."

19:47.477 --> 19:48.562
It's "Wong."

19:52.149 --> 19:53.233
Hmm.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.361
I feel good.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.990
I feel very good about this.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.089
Looks like
your boy's not coming after all.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.091
It's a shame.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.067
Mowang.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.235
Speak up.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.739
- There's something you should know.
- Oh, yeah?

20:42.115 --> 20:45.786
Then please enlighten me with your wisdom...
...Great Sage.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.042
I'm sorry.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.800
- What did you just say?
- I'm so sorry.

21:01.093 --> 21:05.347
I failed you when you needed me most.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.141
I left you.

21:14.398 --> 21:17.067
I always knew
you were a shape-shifter, Wukong,

21:17.901 --> 21:21.113
but the day you took everything away
from me, I realized something.

21:22.114 --> 21:26.285
I was the one who needed a change.
And that's what I did.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.871
So you don't need to apologize.

21:31.290 --> 21:35.502
In many ways, you made me who I am today.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.049
Hey, you.

21:45.595 --> 21:46.763
What are you laughing at?

21:56.398 --> 22:00.360
Hey, we'll talk about this
later tonight, huh?

22:00.360 --> 22:02.863
I thought you were going
to Auntie Elaine's for a few days.

22:14.875 --> 22:15.876
Go to class, Jin.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.225
Where's the pendant?

22:33.727 --> 22:34.978
I want my father first.

22:35.645 --> 22:36.772
That's not how this works.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.983
Stop messing around, kid.
Just show us the bling.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.488
You don't have it, do you?

22:46.573 --> 22:48.283
Is there even a Fourth Scroll at all?

22:48.283 --> 22:50.702
I'm not here to talk
about the Fourth Scroll.

22:53.789 --> 22:58.877
So you took the staff,
came down to Earth and caused all of this,

22:58.877 --> 23:02.881
and you still have no idea
if this thing even exists.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.885
Wow.

23:10.472 --> 23:11.973
You must be so proud of your son.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.106
Now, don't be ashamed.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.359
You know how your dad got the staff?

23:22.984 --> 23:23.985
He stole it.

23:23.985 --> 23:27.364
That's right.
He's no better than any of us.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.284
And now that I know
that you have nothing to offer,

23:31.284 --> 23:33.829
there's no reason
for me not to kill you both.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.408
You going back to the office?

24:11.408 --> 24:12.576
Mm-hmm.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.830
You leaving for your sister's?

24:18.498 --> 24:19.541
I don't know.

24:23.336 --> 24:24.254
Thank you.

24:26.214 --> 24:27.799
For what you said in the office.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.137
That was nice. Thank you.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.063
Why are you crying?

24:47.652 --> 24:49.988
I want our son to be successful.

24:49.988 --> 24:52.032
But I'm failing my own life.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.784
You're not failing.

24:55.118 --> 24:57.662
I'm borrowing money
from my younger sister.

25:02.626 --> 25:07.672
You asked me once
what happened to the guy you married.

25:09.799 --> 25:13.637
But what happened to the girl I married?

25:15.055 --> 25:17.516
The girl who loved singing.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.895
The girl who laughed
at the top of her lungs.

25:24.689 --> 25:28.693
The girl who was so bold
she came here with nothing...

25:30.403 --> 25:31.780
She turned into a housewife

25:33.323 --> 25:35.200
and a... [in English] ...church lady.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.994
She drives a station wagon.

25:37.994 --> 25:40.330
And got lost in house chores.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.751
And then she gave all our money
to an old herbalist.

25:51.591 --> 25:53.385
That old herbalist believed in me.

25:55.679 --> 25:58.390
And it felt good.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.815
I have to buy some groceries.

26:14.864 --> 26:17.784
You really think you can
challenge me when I have <i>Jīngū Bàng</i>?

26:17.784 --> 26:21.329
You may hold it in your hands,

26:21.329 --> 26:23.707
but you will never know how to use it
like my father.

26:23.707 --> 26:27.252
You're right.
I have much bigger plans for it.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.338
I'll give you one last chance.

26:30.839 --> 26:33.592
Join us, or die trying to be a hero.

26:39.723 --> 26:42.017
You already have Wukong.
You don't need to hurt the boy.

26:42.601 --> 26:43.935
Look who finally sobered up.

26:46.479 --> 26:47.772
Do it!

26:52.694 --> 26:54.988
Whoa!

27:10.086 --> 27:12.631
You're the one who wasted my time
on the Fourth Scroll

27:12.631 --> 27:14.549
with these stupid paintings.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.136
No!

27:18.136 --> 27:19.471
What are you doing?

27:20.722 --> 27:22.390
No! Stop!

27:23.975 --> 27:25.518
Please! I'm begging you.

27:57.425 --> 27:59.052
- No!
- Let's go!

28:02.430 --> 28:04.307
Dad!

28:10.188 --> 28:11.981
It's too late. Come on!

28:19.280 --> 28:22.409
You can't save him! Save yourself!
