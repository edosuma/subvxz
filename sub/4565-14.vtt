Can't you just

You know what?
It's up to you guys
to make changes.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.559
So any nominations?

I, farkle, nominate
i, farkle, for dictator.

you can't nominate
yourself, farkle.

03:19.466 --> 03:22.367
- I'll nominate him.
- Really?

03:22.369 --> 03:24.870
Yeah.  I like ya.
I got your back.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.105

Oh, you're the good guy.
You're our moral compass.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.588
Wow.  That sounds

03:42.590 --> 03:44.089
Yeah, but you're
really good at it.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.992

- See?

03:48.729 --> 03:51.563
He's right, friar.
Represent democracy.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.799
I don't know,
mr. Matthews.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.434
If democracy worked,

03:55.436 --> 03:57.603
Maybe i'd have gotten a vote
on where i get to live.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.106
I nominate lucas friar
for president.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.008
Okay.  Second?

04:04.545 --> 04:05.978
No, honey,
you nominated him.

He's your competition.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.586
- I'm not running
for anything.
- Yes, you are.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.989
I got plans for you.

04:16.991 --> 04:19.958
- Yeah.
- You know what?

04:19.960 --> 04:22.027
It'd be an honor
to run for president.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.596
Thank you, riley.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.065
My pleasure, buddy.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.201
I don't know
how it happens.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.473
I'm nominating you
for something.

- Listen to me--
- no!  You listen to me.

04:42.950 --> 04:47.019
I'm 12 years old.
The window is closing
on my princess dream.

04:47.021 --> 04:49.555
I'm too old
to be a flower girl,

04:49.556 --> 04:52.090
And i ain't winning
any pageants until i grow
into these limbs.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.860

Impartial!
As your teacher,

05:08.075 --> 05:10.208
I must refrain
from showing any favoritism.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.061
- ( whispering ) quiet!
- ( yelps )

05:29.063 --> 05:32.497
Auggie will not go to sleep.
I don't know what's wrong.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.965
I have an idea.

05:34.902 --> 05:35.967
Mommy.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.255
Cory:
<i>How come you're</i>
<i>still awake, aug?</i>

05:40.256 --> 05:42.540
When mommy read
the book the first time,
she said...

05:42.543 --> 05:44.076
( sweetly )
"if you give
a mouse a cookie,

05:44.078 --> 05:45.744
He'll ask
for a glass of milk."

05:45.746 --> 05:48.880
But then,
five times later,
she was like...

05:48.882 --> 05:53.151
( angrily )
"eat your stinking
cookie, mouse!

05:53.153 --> 05:54.753
Eat it!"

05:56.023 --> 05:57.856
( normal voice )
and now i'm awake.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.727
Corey, look,
i know tonight
is my night,

06:01.729 --> 06:03.895
But could you please
put him to bed?

06:03.897 --> 06:05.230
Topanga,
i gotta grade papers.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.665
I gotta be
at court at 8:00 a.M.

06:06.667 --> 06:07.999
To stop a nursing home
from being torn down.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.869
I gotta have breakfast
with mother teresa and gandhi,

06:10.871 --> 06:12.871
And we are going
to play racquetball.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.606
And she's really good.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.014
I'm awake.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.717
Hey, aug, guess what.
You know what?

06:25.719 --> 06:28.086
The phillies are playing
the mets on tv.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.255
- Uh, don't you think
it's a little late?
- <i> ( crowd cheering on tv )</i>

06:30.257 --> 06:32.090
Topanga,
it's the ninth inning.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.759
There's like
five minutes left.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.895
Hey, you have failed.
How could i do worse?

06:36.897 --> 06:38.096
- I'll tell you--

What could happen?

<i>And at the end of nine:</i>

06:47.557 --> 06:49.040

- ( gasps )
- look, honey,
you got what you wanted!

07:20.307 --> 07:22.841
- He's sleeping.
- Oh.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.810
Honey, i want him
sleeping at night,

07:24.812 --> 07:26.878
And now he's not gonna
sleep again tonight.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.047
Why won't he sleep
at night?  Tell me.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.017
You i'm leaving there.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.829
And that's how
you get outta that.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.137
Everybody deserves

07:52.139 --> 07:53.071
The right to vote.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.206

- Yeah.

It is i,
your benevolent dictator.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.410

i am kind

How could you
do this to me, farkle?

11:02.729 --> 11:04.863
You told me you were
just gonna take a picture
of the horse.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.164
I want to win.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.966

Riley, i...

Yay.

to strike back hard.
- Fine.

11:22.282 --> 11:25.183
The truth is...
That horse had a dream.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.552
All that horse ever wanted
was to be a unicorn,

11:27.554 --> 11:29.921
And i made
that dream come true.

11:29.923 --> 11:32.090
That horse loves me!

11:32.092 --> 11:34.459

He spies on us,
he'll spy on all of you!

11:40.534 --> 11:42.567
I bet there's cameras
on all of you right now.

What you have to decide
is if you want to live

Farkle's nothing

- Lucas is
the competition now.
- I'm not attacking lucas.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.398

to do anything.
- No.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.000
Riley, this is your last
chance to be a princess.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.036
Everybody's got
something they're hiding.

12:18.038 --> 12:21.039
Even lucas.
I'm gonna find out
what it is.

Trust me.
So you know what?

13:14.694 --> 13:16.594
Why don't we gather
all these little pillows

13:16.596 --> 13:18.263
"gather," that's the word!

13:18.265 --> 13:19.964
Oh!  What happened?

13:19.966 --> 13:21.533
I dreamt
i was vulnerable

13:21.535 --> 13:23.968
And somebody was
throwing pillows at me.

why this is funny.

I can't do it, cory.
I can't get him
to go to bed.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.411
I give him to you,
you give him to me.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.080
Well, honey, you know what?
We're two working parents.

13:36.082 --> 13:39.184

arrange it so that one
of us is with him.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.688
Look, honey,
he's real close.

You put him to bed.

Nobody at school has
a bad thing to say about him.

- Good.
- Our only hope

- Hi, lucas.

No, i'm not trying to argue,
but this isn't my home.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.192
Texas is my home.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.793
But, dad, you told me

to see my friends.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.133
Yes, i have friends here.

- Quiet, princess.

What, that you don't want
to be in our class?

15:25.725 --> 15:29.327
How could that hurt you,
running for president
of our class?

Don't worry.
It's only her word
against yours.

This isn't gonna
change anything.

Secretary of state is
the president's ambassador

18:45.492 --> 18:47.409
It means he thinks
highly of you.

18:47.410 --> 18:49.327
