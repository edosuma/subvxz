00:02.439 --> 00:04.939
(tense music)

00:26.661 --> 00:29.411
(dramatic music)

01:11.878 --> 01:14.259
(crow wings flapping)

01:14.259 --> 01:16.842
(crows cawing)

01:23.443 --> 01:27.150
- [Tilda] This isn't a
once upon a time story,

01:27.150 --> 01:28.933
nor is it a love story.

01:29.830 --> 01:32.893
And let's say there isn't
a happy ending either.

01:33.850 --> 01:38.850
But like every fairy tale,
there is an evil queen,

01:39.780 --> 01:44.780
a prince, a destined princess
and a wicked, wicked curse.

01:47.009 --> 01:48.830
(birds chirping)

01:48.830 --> 01:53.830
But to know the truth, we must go back

01:53.900 --> 01:54.893
to the beginning.

01:56.973 --> 02:00.676
(car door slamming)

02:00.676 --> 02:03.773
(crow cawing)
My name is Tilda Crow.

02:05.250 --> 02:10.250
I love my husband, God and old things.

02:10.530 --> 02:13.763
My mother always said I
could have been a movie star,

02:14.670 --> 02:18.013
but I chose a life behind a picket fence.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.923
My husband is a doctor.

02:32.340 --> 02:34.320
He's had one affair.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.960
- Thank you, babe.

02:35.960 --> 02:36.871
Love you.

02:36.871 --> 02:39.053
- [Tilda] He doesn't know
that I know the truth.

02:42.069 --> 02:43.403
And I kept it that way

02:45.160 --> 02:47.663
for the sanctity of our marriage.

02:51.020 --> 02:52.063
- Welcome, doctor.

02:54.190 --> 02:56.403
- [Tilda] And that's why we're here.

02:58.090 --> 03:01.883
A fresh new start never hurt any marriage.

03:06.410 --> 03:10.760
When you're in love, and young,

03:10.760 --> 03:13.677
oh, it's easy to turn a blind eye.

03:14.590 --> 03:15.490
- Have a good day.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.350
- Love you!

03:20.350 --> 03:25.073
As I sat in that empty
house by myself each day,

03:26.370 --> 03:28.233
I knew there was a sound missing,

03:29.490 --> 03:31.703
a sound I'd often ache for.

03:32.550 --> 03:35.453
Doc, he wanted it, too.

03:36.290 --> 03:39.263
After years of tryin',
we finally got pregnant.

03:40.250 --> 03:42.440
Doc was working a lot of late nights,

03:42.440 --> 03:45.313
but all I was thinking about was the baby.

03:46.570 --> 03:50.017
Until it was all ripped
away from me one night.

03:51.470 --> 03:52.620
- Hey, honey, I'm home!

03:56.668 --> 03:57.502
(Tilda sobbing)

03:57.502 --> 03:58.335
Tilda!

04:03.020 --> 04:04.376
Baby?

04:04.376 --> 04:06.730
(Tilda sobbing)

04:06.730 --> 04:09.128
Hey, Tilda, what's wrong?

04:09.128 --> 04:10.378
Tilda, open the door.

04:10.378 --> 04:12.037
(eerie whimsical music)

04:12.037 --> 04:16.803
- [Tilda] The day I lost my
baby was the day I lost my soul.

04:18.417 --> 04:21.334
(brush scratching)

04:25.060 --> 04:30.060
My mother always said
darkness is a cancer.

04:30.440 --> 04:31.993
It grows inside of you.

04:33.390 --> 04:36.263
Once it starts, it doesn't stop.

04:37.670 --> 04:39.832
It might even show up at your doorstep.

04:42.927 --> 04:46.407
And whatever I invited,

04:46.407 --> 04:50.187
I knew it would change my life forever.

04:53.836 --> 04:56.419
(upbeat music)

05:01.228 --> 05:02.630
- Morning, sweetheart!

05:02.630 --> 05:04.193
You ready to take on the day?

05:05.450 --> 05:06.950
- Does it look like I'm ready?

05:09.009 --> 05:10.093
- Don't be nervous.

05:11.580 --> 05:12.500
- Easy for you to say,

05:12.500 --> 05:13.960
you don't have to go to a new school

05:13.960 --> 05:15.563
for the fifth time this year.

05:17.190 --> 05:19.970
- I'm sure the girls here
will be a lot friendlier.

05:19.970 --> 05:22.890
I mean, it's California, sweetheart.

05:22.890 --> 05:23.853
- I hate Dad's job.

05:25.470 --> 05:28.533
- And he hates having us
move, more than you know.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.690
But hey, at least you get to
live in all these great places.

05:32.690 --> 05:34.030
- But I can't have a normal life.

05:34.030 --> 05:36.430
I can't make friends.

05:36.430 --> 05:37.793
Can't go on dates.

05:43.900 --> 05:47.640
Besides, I already said
I'm going to SFU next year.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.860
- And how are you gonna afford
to live in San Francisco?

05:50.860 --> 05:53.610
- I'm gonna get a job
like a normal person.

05:53.610 --> 05:55.470
- Okay, well, when you're on your own,

05:55.470 --> 05:57.480
you can do whatever you want.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.430
- I'm counting down the days.

05:59.430 --> 06:00.453
- Eat your toast.

06:05.039 --> 06:07.872
(toast crunching)

06:12.710 --> 06:13.940
- Hey mom, I'm home!

06:24.280 --> 06:25.113
Mom?

06:27.049 --> 06:27.882
Dad?

06:40.730 --> 06:41.630
Mom, are you home?

06:45.618 --> 06:48.701
(car engine roaring)

06:53.609 --> 06:54.788
(person knocking)

06:54.788 --> 06:57.705
(thunder rattling)

06:59.180 --> 07:00.013
Mom?

07:03.159 --> 07:06.610
(policeman knocking)

07:06.610 --> 07:09.469
- Good evening, ma'am,
are you Elaine Crow?

07:09.469 --> 07:10.302
- Yes.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.450
- I'm Mr. Delagos,

07:12.450 --> 07:15.173
I'm a social worker with the
Irvine Police Department.

07:18.150 --> 07:19.840
There was an accident earlier today

07:19.840 --> 07:21.893
that your parents were involved in.

07:23.127 --> 07:25.313
- My parents? Are they okay?

07:27.636 --> 07:30.920
- I'm so sorry, they didn't make it.

07:32.340 --> 07:33.493
- That can't be true.

07:34.570 --> 07:36.120
It can't be.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.830
- [Mr. Delagos] You should
pack a bag and come with us.

07:37.830 --> 07:39.080
- I'm not going anywhere.

07:41.030 --> 07:43.193
- Elaine, this needs to happen now.

07:44.054 --> 07:45.254
You can't be here alone.

07:46.225 --> 07:48.860
(Elaine panting)
(heartbeat pounding)

07:48.860 --> 07:51.140
- [Elaine] I'm not going anywhere.

07:51.140 --> 07:52.840
- Ma'am, we need you to cooperate.

07:56.305 --> 07:58.805
(tense music)

08:03.345 --> 08:04.965
(wind howling)
(birds chirping)

08:04.965 --> 08:07.715
(dramatic music)

08:17.177 --> 08:19.673
(car engine roaring)

08:19.673 --> 08:22.173
(crow cawing)

08:28.340 --> 08:30.150
- Have you even met her?

08:30.150 --> 08:31.970
- No, but we've had many phone calls

08:31.970 --> 08:34.330
and she is open arms into taking you win.

08:34.330 --> 08:37.159
- I've never heard of
her, she could be a phony.

08:37.159 --> 08:38.000
- I doubt that.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.870
She is in fact your father's only sister.

08:40.870 --> 08:42.850
And since your mother has no siblings,

08:44.217 --> 08:45.050
this is the best suited choice for you.

08:46.390 --> 08:48.270
- Then why have I never heard of her?

08:48.270 --> 08:50.693
- She did mention a falling
out with your father.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.600
Look, you turn 18 soon.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.700
So when the time comes
and you decide to leave,

08:56.700 --> 08:57.633
be my guest.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.713
But she is family.

09:00.730 --> 09:02.430
I'd be counting my blessings, kid.

09:04.130 --> 09:05.083
- What blessings?

09:06.690 --> 09:09.623
- I know how hard it's
been, this isn't easy, kid.

09:11.060 --> 09:11.960
- Like you'd know.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.583
- I lost my daughter 12 years ago.

09:16.370 --> 09:17.203
I know.

09:27.255 --> 09:29.838
(somber music)

09:39.863 --> 09:43.130
The town was founded in the late 1800s,

09:43.130 --> 09:44.683
a boom town for miners.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.030
I had to do some digging
to find some research.

09:50.598 --> 09:52.260
(Mr. Delagos laughing)

09:52.260 --> 09:54.400
Get it? Digging?

09:54.400 --> 09:56.372
'Cause it's a miner's town.

09:56.372 --> 09:58.955
(somber music)

10:22.114 --> 10:24.947
(uplifting music)

10:58.535 --> 11:01.285
(dramatic music)

11:11.645 --> 11:14.895
(Mr. Delagos knocking)

11:18.456 --> 11:19.539
- Oh, Elaine!

11:20.737 --> 11:21.737
Oh, my dear!

11:23.508 --> 11:24.341
Oh!

11:25.563 --> 11:28.723
I am so sorry about your
father and your mother.

11:30.321 --> 11:35.321
Listen, everything is gonna
be all right now, okay?

11:35.412 --> 11:38.520
'Cause your auntie's here.

11:38.520 --> 11:41.883
And Mr. Delagos, it is
so lovely to meet you.

11:42.808 --> 11:45.773
My! What a handsome man you are.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.678
I'm Tilda, Tilda Crow.

11:49.678 --> 11:51.940
(thunder rumbling)

11:51.940 --> 11:54.820
Come on in, come on, come on, Elaine!

11:58.177 --> 11:59.983
Here you go, come on in.

12:01.490 --> 12:03.070
- This is a beautiful home, Tilda.

12:03.070 --> 12:05.357
How long have you lived here?

12:05.357 --> 12:07.450
- Far too long I'm afraid.

12:07.450 --> 12:10.263
Yeah, she's really in need of a facelift.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.470
Would you like to see your room, Elaine?

12:13.470 --> 12:15.500
Come on, right this way, honey!

12:15.500 --> 12:17.720
Let's go, up here!

12:17.720 --> 12:19.830
This is such a sunny side of the house.

12:19.830 --> 12:21.280
I think you're gonna love it.

12:22.970 --> 12:24.653
I hope you'll find it suitable.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.603
Some of these things I had
when I was around your age.

12:32.499 --> 12:35.137
Well listen, you look around, all right?

12:35.137 --> 12:37.750
Mr. Delagos, can I interest
you in a cup of tea?

12:46.077 --> 12:51.077
(birds chirping)
(dramatic music)

13:15.293 --> 13:17.393
I think she is gonna get along just fine.

13:18.938 --> 13:21.610
Listen, I'm cooking supper
right now, Mr. Delagos,

13:21.610 --> 13:23.960
any chance you'd like to stay for dinner?

13:23.960 --> 13:27.570
- No, I actually should be
checking back into the hotel.

13:27.570 --> 13:29.870
I'll be back in a few
days to check on Elaine.

13:31.270 --> 13:35.090
Elaine, get some sleep, because
you start school tomorrow.

13:35.090 --> 13:37.293
If you need me, I'll be at the hotel.

13:38.670 --> 13:39.870
Have a pleasant evening.

13:43.630 --> 13:45.263
- Good day, Mr. Delagos.

13:46.580 --> 13:49.247
(door slamming)

13:50.530 --> 13:53.290
Well come on here and let me
take a look at you, child.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.550
Come on!

13:54.550 --> 13:55.400
Don't you be shy.

13:56.988 --> 13:58.350
(Tilda chuckling)

13:58.350 --> 13:59.973
Aren't you precious?

14:01.420 --> 14:03.260
Oh yes, indeed.

14:04.535 --> 14:05.983
You are so precious.

14:07.127 --> 14:09.877
(Tilda laughing)

14:14.129 --> 14:16.212
- Are you really my aunt?

14:23.030 --> 14:27.313
- You know, Elaine, I may not
be able to change your past,

14:28.340 --> 14:30.603
but I can make up for it in the future.

14:31.997 --> 14:34.797
I'm gonna have some girls over
from the neighborhood tonight.

14:35.998 --> 14:37.923
Would you mind, hmm?

14:41.498 --> 14:43.100
I'll have a little party.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.280
- What kind of party?

14:44.280 --> 14:48.300
- Oh, you never mind about that, darling.

14:48.300 --> 14:49.730
But you're gonna go upstairs,

14:49.730 --> 14:51.680
I got a little dress in
the wardrobe for you.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.423
I want you to put that on, okay?

14:57.010 --> 14:59.003
And you lose those godawful boots.

15:04.569 --> 15:07.676
Well, you're in Bloomfield now, dear,

15:07.676 --> 15:11.093
and it's time to dress for that occasion.

(Sam laughing)

16:38.919 --> 16:41.559
Oh, what'd you expect?

16:41.559 --> 16:42.780
You are the queen.

16:42.780 --> 16:45.240
- [Girl] So are you hiding her, Tilda?

16:45.240 --> 16:47.790
- She's quite a strange girl.

16:47.790 --> 16:48.980
She keeps to herself.

16:49.937 --> 16:52.217
Elaine!

16:52.217 --> 16:53.050
Elaine!

16:56.697 --> 16:59.503
There is our sweet Elaine.

17:01.457 --> 17:04.000
Honey, you cannot keep yourself cooped up

17:04.000 --> 17:06.010
in that room forever.

17:06.010 --> 17:07.690
- [Girl] Turn for us, dear!

17:07.690 --> 17:08.522
- Come on, now.

17:09.859 --> 17:12.017
- She obviously takes after
your side of the family.

17:12.017 --> 17:13.240
(everyone laughing)

17:13.240 --> 17:16.487
- Yes, everything but the fashion sense.

17:16.487 --> 17:19.487
(everyone laughing)

17:21.210 --> 17:22.863
Would you excuse us a moment?

17:29.910 --> 17:32.640
I see that you did not choose the dress

17:32.640 --> 17:34.720
that I asked you to wear.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.025
Why not, hmm?

17:37.025 --> 17:38.813
Are you trying to embarrass me?

17:40.830 --> 17:42.563
- What are you celebrating?

17:44.050 --> 17:46.284
- Adult things.

17:46.284 --> 17:47.830
Now, you go on down to that basement

17:47.830 --> 17:50.350
and you fetch us some
red wine, you hear me?

17:50.350 --> 17:51.183
Go on, now.

18:00.390 --> 18:01.663
Let's party!

18:01.663 --> 18:04.413
(crowd cheering)

18:05.554 --> 18:08.054
(tense music)

18:20.823 --> 18:25.703
(rat squeaking)
(metal rattling)

18:25.703 --> 18:28.575
(voices whispering)

18:28.575 --> 18:31.325
(dramatic music)

18:33.815 --> 18:38.815
(voices whispering)
(tense music)

18:43.794 --> 18:46.724
(doorknob rattling)

18:46.724 --> 18:47.807
- Aunt Tilda?

18:49.284 --> 18:51.183
Aunt Tilda, the door is locked.

18:54.650 --> 18:55.483
Aunt Tilda!

18:56.892 --> 18:59.380
(doorknob rattling)

18:59.380 --> 19:00.213
Anyone?

19:02.240 --> 19:04.273
Aunt Tilda, the door is-

19:04.273 --> 19:08.343
- Good Lord, child,
what is wrong with you?

19:09.803 --> 19:11.763
You like you've seen a ghost.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.570
- The door was locked.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.610
- Elaine, this door does not lock.

19:17.610 --> 19:19.350
- It was definitely locked.

19:19.350 --> 19:22.950
- It definitely wasn't, now
come on, your playtime's over.

19:22.950 --> 19:25.760
I'm wanna introduce you to
some of my friends, come on.

19:28.361 --> 19:31.361
(voices whispering)

19:35.092 --> 19:38.259
(school bell ringing)

19:42.140 --> 19:42.973
- Hey, new girl!

19:43.900 --> 19:44.733
Where you from?

19:45.617 --> 19:47.590
- Oh, I'm from Irvine.

19:47.590 --> 19:48.423
- City girl.

19:49.561 --> 19:51.393
- I don't see you girls running!

19:52.450 --> 19:53.650
- Pipe it down, Shirley.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.350
- Well, I'm Cindy.

19:56.350 --> 19:57.940
- I'm Erica.

19:57.940 --> 19:59.943
- I'm Miranda, the class president.

20:01.010 --> 20:02.430
- I'm Elaine.

20:02.430 --> 20:03.610
It's nice to meet you guys.

20:03.610 --> 20:05.870
- You're Tilda's niece, right?

20:05.870 --> 20:07.240
- How did you know that?

20:07.240 --> 20:10.690
- It's a small town, everyone
knows everything around here.

20:10.690 --> 20:12.790
We've been expecting you.

20:12.790 --> 20:14.660
- It's that small, huh?

20:14.660 --> 20:16.090
- Yeah.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.393
- Do you girls want a failing grade?

20:19.780 --> 20:20.613
- Oh my God.

20:22.086 --> 20:23.730
- I have an idea.

20:23.730 --> 20:26.653
Hey, um what about a sleepover tonight?

20:27.570 --> 20:28.420
- That'll be fun!

20:29.440 --> 20:31.770
- I mean, yeah, I can always ask my aunt.

20:31.770 --> 20:33.500
I'm sure that's okay.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.230
- I'll bring snacks!

20:35.230 --> 20:37.617
- Perfect, we'll see you tonight.

20:37.617 --> 20:40.534
(Miranda knocking)

20:46.580 --> 20:48.280
- Hello, girls!

20:48.280 --> 20:50.263
- [Girls] Hi, Mrs. Crow.

20:51.250 --> 20:55.400
- I imagine you met Elaine, haven't you?

20:55.400 --> 20:57.803
- Yeah, we're gonna
have a super sleepover.

21:00.248 --> 21:04.453
- I brought snacks!

21:11.284 --> 21:13.953
(thunder rumbling)

21:13.953 --> 21:16.536
(upbeat music)

21:18.223 --> 21:19.056
- Hey.

21:22.410 --> 21:24.060
- What is that?

21:24.060 --> 21:24.970
- Well, actually, it's-

21:24.970 --> 21:25.803
- Just drink it.

21:35.551 --> 21:38.320
- Ugh, what alcohol was that?

21:38.320 --> 21:39.803
- We used-

21:39.803 --> 21:42.503
- I made it, we call it The Devil's Juice.

21:45.440 --> 21:48.133
- So have you seen anything in the house?

21:49.040 --> 21:49.873
- Like what?

21:50.950 --> 21:51.783
- Ghost!

21:52.810 --> 21:54.860
- It's not like this house is haunted.

21:54.860 --> 21:57.570
- I hear the old Doc haunts the halls here

21:57.570 --> 21:58.920
and the abandoned hospital.

21:59.810 --> 22:01.683
- Well, I don't believe in ghosts.

22:03.040 --> 22:06.040
- So you wouldn't mind us
checking out the basement, then?

22:07.370 --> 22:09.720
- Why do you want to go down there?

22:09.720 --> 22:11.350
- 'Cause we want to!

22:11.350 --> 22:12.780
- Look at her.

22:12.780 --> 22:13.863
She looks so scared!

22:17.120 --> 22:20.020
- You guys really want to check
out a smelly old basement?

22:21.150 --> 22:21.983
- Yeah.

22:22.829 --> 22:23.662
- Duh.

22:27.500 --> 22:30.167
(door creaking)

22:34.930 --> 22:36.663
- You go first, we'll follow.

22:39.690 --> 22:41.369
- That alcohol was really strong.

22:41.369 --> 22:44.300
(girls chuckling)

22:44.300 --> 22:45.210
Hey! Hey!

22:47.471 --> 22:48.304
Hey!

22:49.320 --> 22:50.153
Let me out!

22:50.153 --> 22:54.944
(glass shattering)
(tense music)

23:02.510 --> 23:03.640
(ball thudding)

23:03.640 --> 23:06.223
(ball rolling)

23:11.535 --> 23:14.452
(thunder rumbling)

23:19.439 --> 23:22.269
(voices whispering)

23:22.269 --> 23:24.479
(tense music)

23:24.479 --> 23:26.519
(Elaine gasping)

23:26.519 --> 23:29.436
(Elaine screaming)

23:31.751 --> 23:33.471
(Elaine screaming)

23:33.471 --> 23:35.140
(girls laughing)

23:35.140 --> 23:36.640
- What, it's not like you died!

23:36.640 --> 23:38.959
- You should've seen
the look on your face!

23:38.959 --> 23:41.459
(tense music)

23:43.050 --> 23:44.959
(Elaine panting)

23:44.959 --> 23:47.792
(stairs creaking)

23:51.951 --> 23:53.890
- What happened?

23:53.890 --> 23:56.503
Elaine, come on back here!

23:58.671 --> 24:02.220
- Ugh, I see you girls!

24:02.220 --> 24:04.677
Don't you think that I don't!

24:04.677 --> 24:06.613
Oh, I am gonna get you!

24:07.600 --> 24:10.067
Punishment awaits you all

24:11.739 --> 24:13.220
and soon.

24:13.220 --> 24:15.803
(opera music plays)

24:28.198 --> 24:30.089
(voices whispering)

24:30.089 --> 24:32.468
(girl laughing)

24:32.468 --> 24:34.385
- [Miranda] Just do it!

24:36.900 --> 24:38.538
- [Cindy] Just drink!

24:38.538 --> 24:41.687
(girl laughing)

24:41.687 --> 24:46.152
(Elaine groaning)
- No idea!

24:46.152 --> 24:48.298
- [Miranda] Do it, do it!

24:48.298 --> 24:49.131
Just do it.

24:49.131 --> 24:51.381
- (girls whispering)

24:57.540 --> 24:58.411
- [Miranda] whispering

24:58.411 --> 25:01.244
(Elaine groaning)

25:04.957 --> 25:05.790
Sink!

25:09.337 --> 25:12.254
(crowd chattering)

25:13.457 --> 25:16.457
(voices whispering)

25:27.007 --> 25:28.132
Get lost!

25:28.132 --> 25:31.465
End it, just rip and cut in half!

25:31.465 --> 25:33.965
- [Erica] Don't, don't, don't!

25:36.076 --> 25:37.285
- Why you trying to kill yourself, huh?

25:37.285 --> 25:38.118
- Hey!

25:39.464 --> 25:42.297
(Elaine retching)

25:44.240 --> 25:46.440
- Keep your pitchforks locked up.

25:46.440 --> 25:47.563
It's very hazardous.

25:51.544 --> 25:53.544
Here, come here.

25:53.544 --> 25:55.144
I see you tried your foot first.

25:56.154 --> 25:57.904
Then decided to go this route, huh?

26:00.693 --> 26:05.401
- I went running into town
and then I blacked out.

26:05.401 --> 26:07.490
(Rory laughing)

26:07.490 --> 26:10.443
- Well, that is what
alcohol will do to you.

26:11.432 --> 26:15.440
- No, I just had a sip of Devil's Juice,

26:15.440 --> 26:16.390
these girls made it.

26:16.390 --> 26:19.823
- Ah, Devil's Juice.

26:21.180 --> 26:24.000
Let me tell you something
about Devil's Juice,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
that's an old witch's brew.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.537
So whoever wanted you to have that,

26:29.537 --> 26:31.737
obviously wasn't looking
for something good.

26:34.342 --> 26:36.000
(crickets chirping)

26:36.000 --> 26:39.823
So I hear your name's Elaine Crow.

26:41.289 --> 26:42.989
Hey, hey okay, calm down.

26:44.247 --> 26:45.080
Before you get those big brown eyes,

26:45.080 --> 26:47.000
your Aunt Tilda told me.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.223
Look, our population around
here is, I don't know, 98.

26:52.090 --> 26:54.780
So, you know what that makes you?

26:54.780 --> 26:55.613
99.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.427
Nice to meet you, 99.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.670
- If you wouldn't have been here-

27:03.670 --> 27:04.543
- Oh, I know.

27:05.700 --> 27:07.580
Then poor old Grandpa
Jengis would have found you

27:07.580 --> 27:08.413
in the morning.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.910
All right, let's get up, I'm out.

27:12.910 --> 27:13.743
Come on.

27:17.740 --> 27:19.157
Hop on, let's go.

27:21.252 --> 27:22.911
Up we go.

27:22.911 --> 27:24.540
- [Elaine] What were
you even doing out here?

27:24.540 --> 27:26.880
- [Rory] Ah, checking up on my civilians.

27:26.880 --> 27:29.130
- [Elaine] What are you,
a suicide detective?

27:30.630 --> 27:33.828
- Oh no, I'm the mayor.

27:33.828 --> 27:36.411
(somber music)

27:39.473 --> 27:41.163
- [Tilda] I wanted a baby.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.903
They said that they had a way.

27:49.890 --> 27:52.033
They said it was a ceremony.

27:54.288 --> 27:56.437
And I believed them back then.

27:58.548 --> 28:01.298
(dramatic music)

29:27.241 --> 29:32.241
(upbeat music)
(water burbling)

29:37.225 --> 29:40.058
(Elaine groaning)

29:42.324 --> 29:44.230
(Elaine groaning)

29:44.230 --> 29:46.933
Oh, your poor foot, dear!

29:48.070 --> 29:49.970
Listen, that herbal cream should help.

29:52.640 --> 29:56.083
Also, I want you to try
a little bit of this.

30:00.490 --> 30:01.430
This should help.

30:03.161 --> 30:04.640
- What is it?

30:04.640 --> 30:07.170
- Oh, just a little tea
I spritzed up for you.

30:07.170 --> 30:09.420
It should have you
feelin' better in no time.

30:11.610 --> 30:15.443
Listen, I want you to
eat some carbs, okay?

30:19.070 --> 30:21.473
You are shrinking before my very eyes.

30:23.840 --> 30:24.920
- What is this?

30:24.920 --> 30:27.600
- Oh, this old thing?

30:27.600 --> 30:28.547
Was a gift.

30:29.578 --> 30:30.878
(person knocking)

30:30.878 --> 30:31.711
Ah!

30:33.378 --> 30:35.690
Ah, in the nick of time!

30:35.690 --> 30:37.170
Hello, mayor!

30:37.170 --> 30:38.837
Ah, it's a pleasure!

30:40.050 --> 30:41.308
Woo!

30:41.308 --> 30:43.300
(Tilda laughing)

30:43.300 --> 30:44.843
It's a pleasure to see you!

30:46.130 --> 30:48.130
Hey, I have those dumplings made for you!

30:48.130 --> 30:48.963
- Woo!

30:48.963 --> 30:49.847
- Look at this, hmm?

30:51.160 --> 30:52.450
- Thank you so much for getting them ready

30:52.450 --> 30:53.781
in such short notice.

30:53.781 --> 30:55.763
- Well, anything for you, mayor.

30:56.781 --> 30:59.479
Here, try a bite of that.

30:59.479 --> 31:02.146
(both laughing)

31:06.100 --> 31:07.983
Have you met my niece, Elaine?

31:10.039 --> 31:11.239
- I've had the pleasure.

31:12.730 --> 31:13.663
Hello again.

31:16.669 --> 31:18.229
(both laughing)

31:18.229 --> 31:19.062
Well.

31:22.629 --> 31:23.537
Thank you for the dumplings,

31:23.537 --> 31:26.360
and I'll see you at the next town meeting?

31:26.360 --> 31:28.179
- Oh, yeah, I look forward to it.

31:28.179 --> 31:29.179
- All right.

31:30.200 --> 31:31.033
Elaine.

31:32.070 --> 31:33.197
So long.

31:33.197 --> 31:35.207
- Hey Rory, Rory, come here.

31:35.207 --> 31:36.723
Are you heading into town?

31:37.770 --> 31:39.950
- I am, you need anything?

31:39.950 --> 31:40.803
- Well, you know what?

31:40.803 --> 31:43.863
Why don't you take a
lady to look around, huh?

31:44.950 --> 31:48.930
I been meaning to, but I
just, I have been so busy.

31:48.930 --> 31:49.942
- [Elaine] Aunt Tilda, no.

31:49.942 --> 31:50.990
- What?

31:50.990 --> 31:51.823
Don't be silly.

31:51.823 --> 31:54.109
- [Rory] I'm more than happy
to show you around town.

31:54.109 --> 31:56.590
(boots clacking)

31:56.590 --> 31:57.473
- Splendid.

31:58.540 --> 31:59.637
Now you get some food in her though.

31:59.637 --> 32:01.160
You promise me, right?

32:01.160 --> 32:01.993
- [Rory] I will.

32:07.555 --> 32:10.305
(chair creaking)

32:11.220 --> 32:14.623
- Yes, indeed, you kids
have fun now, you hear?

32:16.099 --> 32:17.710
(door creaking)

32:17.710 --> 32:20.773
Yeah, Tilda Crow.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.313
And Bloomfield's number one matchmaker.

32:27.708 --> 32:30.375
(calming music)

32:46.136 --> 32:47.890
- And here we go, Sam, how's it going?

32:47.890 --> 32:50.400
- Well, how's it going, Rory?

32:50.400 --> 32:52.186
- Ah, just another day in Bloomfield.

32:52.186 --> 32:53.019
How about yourself?

32:53.019 --> 32:54.800
- Oh, you know, same old, same old.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.510
Why, who is this pretty lady?

32:56.510 --> 32:59.243
- This right here is
Tilda's niece, Elaine.

33:00.430 --> 33:01.820
- I'm Sam the old cowboy.

33:01.820 --> 33:04.640
Sam for short, I run this hotel.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.340
Some even call me sheriff.

33:06.340 --> 33:07.770
(Rory laughing)

33:07.770 --> 33:09.362
- All right, Sam.

33:09.362 --> 33:10.197
I'm just showing her around town.

33:10.197 --> 33:13.500
- Well, you could always rent
a room at good old Sam's!

33:13.500 --> 33:15.698
I hear they have great beds.

33:15.698 --> 33:18.365
(guys laughing)

33:21.117 --> 33:23.640
- I think it would be too early for that.

33:23.640 --> 33:26.983
- Well, y'all better get together,
you're not young forever.

33:27.850 --> 33:29.527
It was nice meeting you.

33:30.801 --> 33:33.153
(Sam laughing)
- Hey.

33:33.153 --> 33:34.449
You just don't worry about him, Elaine.

33:34.449 --> 33:36.320
Don't even look at him,
just keep on walking.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.570
It's all right.

33:39.269 --> 33:41.852
(upbeat music)

33:48.690 --> 33:49.523
You like it?

33:51.211 --> 33:53.148
- It's kind of creepy.

33:53.148 --> 33:55.598
- That right there used
to be Dr. Lewis's office.

33:57.170 --> 33:58.900
- Who's Dr. Lewis?

33:58.900 --> 33:59.733
- Oh.

34:00.839 --> 34:01.672
Tilda's husband.

34:03.590 --> 34:05.440
So I guess that makes him your uncle.

34:08.210 --> 34:09.293
- And he's dead?

34:12.248 --> 34:15.572
- I was only a baby,
but I read the records,

34:17.239 --> 34:20.842
body fell in the river,
killer never found.

34:21.888 --> 34:24.554
(Rory laughing)

34:25.750 --> 34:28.607
- Wow, you know a lot about this place.

34:29.567 --> 34:30.723
- Yeah, you know,

34:33.290 --> 34:34.760
I've always had an interest

34:36.179 --> 34:37.580
in the history of this town.

34:42.210 --> 34:43.909
People came here for a fresh start

34:45.618 --> 34:46.483
and they got it.

34:51.811 --> 34:54.311
(tense music)

35:02.020 --> 35:02.943
You all right?

35:06.940 --> 35:10.149
- Yeah, I'm just a little lightheaded.

35:10.149 --> 35:11.300
(Rory laughing)

35:11.300 --> 35:12.410
Is there something to eat around here?

35:12.410 --> 35:15.507
- Well, yes, of course, let's
go get you something to eat.

35:15.507 --> 35:17.270
We've got a nice little diner.

35:17.270 --> 35:19.019
Grilled cheese, strawberry milkshake,

35:19.019 --> 35:20.090
put a little whipped cream on there,

35:20.090 --> 35:21.586
I think you'll like
that, what do you think?

35:21.586 --> 35:23.059
- [Elaine] I'd like that.

35:23.059 --> 35:25.648
(tense music)

35:25.648 --> 35:27.400
- I don't know, I'm gonna
go talk to Rory tonight.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.233
- Well, you better hurry,

35:28.233 --> 35:30.700
'cause I think he's trying
to get at the new girl.

35:30.700 --> 35:32.090
- I'm not worried about her.

35:32.090 --> 35:34.100
- What if he doesn't even like you?

35:34.100 --> 35:36.210
What if he doesn't even want you?

35:36.210 --> 35:37.780
- I have this in the bag.

35:37.780 --> 35:38.930
- Well, talk's going around

35:38.930 --> 35:42.493
he was seen with Elaine last
night, so good luck with that.

35:42.493 --> 35:45.370
- I don't believe you, what's your damage?

35:45.370 --> 35:49.410
- Honestly, I think you're both trash.

35:49.410 --> 35:50.593
Don't call me again.

35:53.520 --> 35:54.570
- What's her problem?

35:56.456 --> 35:57.706
- I don't know.

35:58.568 --> 36:01.235
(door creaking)

36:02.985 --> 36:05.793
- Howdy, need any assistance?

36:06.850 --> 36:10.770
I'm Sam the old cowboy,
but most folks call me Sam.

36:10.770 --> 36:12.320
Why, some even call me sheriff.

36:13.490 --> 36:16.860
- Sam the old cowboy, I'm Mr. Delagos.

36:16.860 --> 36:18.860
I'm a social worker here from California

36:18.860 --> 36:21.593
on behalf of a young
woman named Elaine Crow.

36:22.520 --> 36:25.510
Could you spare a few moments
to answer some questions?

36:25.510 --> 36:28.660
- Mr. Delagos, what do you
think of this town, hmm?

36:32.350 --> 36:33.870
- Off the grid.

36:33.870 --> 36:37.083
Small, but it's a nice little
town you have here, Sam.

36:38.170 --> 36:39.033
- Any family?

36:40.850 --> 36:41.983
- [Mr. Delagos] No, sir.

36:43.220 --> 36:45.323
- This job is all you have, isn't it?

36:47.816 --> 36:52.816
(Sam laughing)
(dramatic music)

36:58.046 --> 37:00.546
(crow cawing)

37:01.507 --> 37:04.424
(crowd chattering)

37:05.820 --> 37:10.060
- Hey, sugar, what can I
get started for you today?

37:10.060 --> 37:11.960
- Oh, you know, I was just
looking for a cold beer

37:11.960 --> 37:15.090
and possibly use your phone,
if that's okay with you?

37:15.090 --> 37:17.140
- You just passing through town?

37:17.140 --> 37:19.400
- Yeah, I'll be out of
here before too long.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.850
- You should stay awhile.

37:20.850 --> 37:24.133
The hotel down the street has great beds.

37:26.260 --> 37:27.565
- Yeah?

37:27.565 --> 37:28.805
Why, thank you, doll, I
think I might do that.

37:31.147 --> 37:31.980
- Phone's in the back.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.043
- Thank you.

37:39.190 --> 37:40.470
- This is good.

37:40.470 --> 37:42.150
- Yeah, go ahead.

37:42.150 --> 37:42.983
- Elaine.

37:49.020 --> 37:49.910
- I saw you coming in

37:49.910 --> 37:52.633
and I whipped you up your
favorite vanilla milkshake.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.613
It's sweet, like always.

38:00.030 --> 38:00.863
How are you?

38:04.180 --> 38:05.153
- I'm good, Trixie.

38:06.690 --> 38:08.183
- Yeah, I see it's real good.

38:12.010 --> 38:13.590
- This is Elaine.

38:13.590 --> 38:14.553
She's new to town.

38:15.560 --> 38:19.700
- Cute, you know this
town loves newcomers.

38:19.700 --> 38:21.203
They come with quite the bite,

38:22.230 --> 38:24.053
but this one's all yours, isn't she?

38:27.891 --> 38:30.327
What can I get started for y'all today?

38:31.890 --> 38:33.290
- I'll get a grilled cheese.

38:37.350 --> 38:38.350
- I'll get my usual.

38:42.890 --> 38:43.723
Oh, boy.

38:43.723 --> 38:46.242
(Rory laughing)

38:48.120 --> 38:51.240
- So, what does a mayor even do?

38:51.240 --> 38:54.460
- Oh, where do I start?

38:54.460 --> 38:56.761
I look after clean water.

38:56.761 --> 38:58.043
We're having our Winter party coming up,

38:58.043 --> 39:00.548
we actually decorate these
streets right behind you

39:00.548 --> 39:01.381
all the way with lights.

39:01.381 --> 39:05.292
♪ A pocket full of posies ♪

39:05.292 --> 39:08.311
♪ Ashes, Ashes ♪

39:08.311 --> 39:11.228
♪ We all fall down ♪

39:13.787 --> 39:15.590
And right down there we also...

39:19.290 --> 39:20.490
Is everything all right?

39:21.780 --> 39:22.613
Hey?

39:23.740 --> 39:26.040
Elaine, what's wrong?

39:26.040 --> 39:28.763
Did she say something
to offend you or did I?

39:30.300 --> 39:31.850
Hey, talk to me.

39:31.850 --> 39:32.683
- I'm sorry.

39:33.803 --> 39:36.433
(cutlery clanking)

39:36.433 --> 39:39.016
(somber music)

39:49.120 --> 39:50.080
- What the hell do you want?

39:50.080 --> 39:51.193
I ain't got no money.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.570
- I'm not asking for money.

39:54.570 --> 39:58.220
I'm a state appointed
administrator investigating a case.

39:58.220 --> 40:00.170
May I have your thoughts on Tilda Crow?

40:01.130 --> 40:03.150
- A state appointed what?

40:03.150 --> 40:04.970
- I'm a state appointed administrator.

40:04.970 --> 40:07.930
- You look too queer to be
out here in these parts.

40:07.930 --> 40:10.640
Why don't you kick rocks
and get off my property?

40:10.640 --> 40:12.137
- Thank you for your time.

40:12.137 --> 40:13.637
- Get out of here.

40:16.070 --> 40:17.250
- Mrs. Crow?

40:17.250 --> 40:18.440
My mom is friends with her.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.320
When I'm sick, Mama goes to Tilda

40:20.320 --> 40:23.550
and brings me back pot of
stew and I feel better.

40:23.550 --> 40:25.350
- Would you call her a good citizen?

40:30.890 --> 40:32.890
- You wanna see my pine cone collection?

40:36.540 --> 40:38.010
- Oh, she's a wicked bitch all right.

40:38.010 --> 40:40.250
She'll steal your pie recipe, too.

40:40.250 --> 40:42.793
No one could be original
in this damn town.

40:50.450 --> 40:51.763
That one'll be mine.

40:54.371 --> 40:56.910
- I think that'll be all
now, ma'am, thank you.

40:56.910 --> 40:58.190
- Are you gonna be at the town meeting?

40:58.190 --> 41:01.770
I'll make sure to save a
special slice of my cherry pie

41:01.770 --> 41:03.263
just for you.

41:04.920 --> 41:05.753
- Town meeting?

41:07.260 --> 41:10.770
- It's tonight, I'm sure
you'll find yourself there.

41:10.770 --> 41:13.300
And don't you forget
about that special slice

41:13.300 --> 41:15.513
I'm saving just for you.

41:19.337 --> 41:20.920
Here, have a taste.

41:30.657 --> 41:32.148
- Creamy.

41:32.148 --> 41:33.363
- The creamiest.

41:34.800 --> 41:35.900
- Have a nice day now.

41:37.560 --> 41:40.137
- I'm gonna take a bite out of you.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.533
Oh, that was damn good.

41:46.268 --> 41:49.018
(dramatic music)

42:07.870 --> 42:08.703
- Hello, Elaine.

42:12.240 --> 42:13.703
Can you sit up for me, please?

42:24.278 --> 42:25.361
- Where am I?

42:26.330 --> 42:27.430
- Bloomfield hospital.

42:29.410 --> 42:30.243
Now breathe.

42:33.920 --> 42:34.753
Deeper.

42:37.129 --> 42:39.962
(Elaine exhaling)

42:43.450 --> 42:45.198
It's just what I thought.

42:45.198 --> 42:46.248
- What is it, doctor?

42:47.520 --> 42:51.727
- I'm sorry to say this, but
you seem to be in grave danger.

42:53.558 --> 42:54.391
- Danger?

42:55.250 --> 42:56.650
- Yes, it doesn't look good.

42:57.940 --> 42:59.540
It's gonna affect your children.

43:01.129 --> 43:02.156
- My children?

43:02.156 --> 43:03.798
- [Tilda] Yoo-hoo!

43:03.798 --> 43:04.631
Elaine?

43:06.610 --> 43:10.997
- I'm sorry, Elaine, I have
to get to my next patient.

43:10.997 --> 43:12.414
- [Tilda] Elaine?

43:16.476 --> 43:17.476
- Good luck.

43:20.307 --> 43:22.640
- But wait, Dr. Lewis!

43:22.640 --> 43:24.133
Dr. Lewis, please wait!

43:33.105 --> 43:35.855
(dramatic music)

43:41.945 --> 43:43.796
(Tilda knocking)

43:43.796 --> 43:45.090
(Elaine gasping)

43:45.090 --> 43:46.083
- Elaine, open up!

43:47.740 --> 43:50.530
Listen, you did not eat your breakfast

43:50.530 --> 43:52.510
and you're not gonna eat your lunch?

43:52.510 --> 43:55.460
You keep this up by dinner,
I'm gonna be force feeding you.

43:56.980 --> 43:57.813
Elaine!

44:01.344 --> 44:02.177
Oh, child.

44:06.465 --> 44:09.215
(dramatic music)

44:13.835 --> 44:18.835
(ball rattling)
(voices whispering)

44:25.854 --> 44:28.604
(floor creaking)

44:43.330 --> 44:44.283
- Are you Doc?

44:51.430 --> 44:52.363
Were you murdered?

45:01.060 --> 45:02.510
Was it someone that you knew?

45:04.094 --> 45:06.761
(door rattling)

45:14.410 --> 45:15.840
- Darling, I don't know what in the heck

45:15.840 --> 45:17.100
you are doing in here.

45:21.208 --> 45:22.858
Did you get that in the basement?

45:24.640 --> 45:26.610
- No, I found it.

45:26.610 --> 45:28.240
- So I suppose that just walked itself

45:28.240 --> 45:29.623
on up those stairs, huh?

45:31.780 --> 45:32.613
Give it to me.

45:35.220 --> 45:39.103
This is kept locked in
a chest in the basement.

45:43.330 --> 45:44.430
This was your uncle's.

45:45.700 --> 45:47.163
Please don't play with it.

45:50.270 --> 45:54.263
Oh, and you get your butt
on downstairs for lunch.

45:55.280 --> 45:57.930
And don't keep me
waiting this time, child.

45:57.930 --> 45:58.850
You hear me?

46:01.788 --> 46:04.538
(Elaine gasping)

46:07.846 --> 46:11.126
(Elaine crying)

46:11.126 --> 46:13.793
(food bubbling)

46:18.210 --> 46:21.570
It is very important that you
follow this special recipe

46:21.570 --> 46:24.573
or else you will mess
up this entire thing.

46:27.810 --> 46:29.733
If you wanna marry the mayor,

46:30.630 --> 46:32.910
you gotta act the part, Elaine.

46:32.910 --> 46:33.857
- I just met him.

46:35.047 --> 46:37.343
- I married your uncle
after the third day.

46:39.070 --> 46:41.033
Sometimes when you know, you just know.

46:42.348 --> 46:45.403
And there's no denying that
you are fond of each other.

46:46.410 --> 46:49.617
Why, the entire town's been talking.

46:49.617 --> 46:52.450
(person knocking)

46:53.548 --> 46:54.715
What the hell?

46:57.278 --> 46:58.945
It's that man again.

46:59.877 --> 47:03.689
- Mr. Delagos?

47:03.689 --> 47:06.522
(person knocking)

47:07.427 --> 47:08.927
- Oh, Mr. Delagos.

47:10.850 --> 47:13.160
You're still in town, huh?

47:13.160 --> 47:14.243
- Yes, there are still a few things

47:14.243 --> 47:16.003
that need to be decided on.

47:17.130 --> 47:18.540
- Like?

47:18.540 --> 47:20.240
- May I speak with Elaine, please?

47:21.860 --> 47:23.650
- Of course, Elaine!

47:26.450 --> 47:27.390
Elaine!

47:27.390 --> 47:29.410
Oh, you're so tiny,

47:29.410 --> 47:31.633
I hardly noticed you
in my periphery, dear.

47:32.760 --> 47:33.863
- Alone, please.

47:46.660 --> 47:48.410
- So how are you really holding up?

47:51.650 --> 47:52.483
Is it your aunt?

47:55.200 --> 47:57.200
Elaine, if something is going on,

47:57.200 --> 47:59.300
I need you to know that you could tell me.

48:02.235 --> 48:04.740
- I know what they do to people like me.

48:04.740 --> 48:06.440
You would throw me in a loony bin.

48:07.494 --> 48:10.406
- No, I absolutely will not.

48:10.406 --> 48:12.640
Now tell me what is going on.

48:12.640 --> 48:13.957
Maybe I can help you.

48:16.624 --> 48:18.541
I'm sorry, Mr. Delagos.

48:20.463 --> 48:23.740
I think I have to solve
this one on my own.

48:23.740 --> 48:25.610
- I'm here to help you, kid.

48:25.610 --> 48:27.093
Your safety is my concern.

48:27.950 --> 48:29.500
I'm talking about in here, too.

48:31.403 --> 48:33.770
Look, I know it's been a big change

48:33.770 --> 48:36.320
and it's gonna take a little time,

48:36.320 --> 48:40.240
but I leave soon and I need to know

48:40.240 --> 48:41.940
if this is the best thing for you.

48:43.245 --> 48:44.078
Are you with me?

48:48.660 --> 48:51.290
If you need me, I'll be at the hotel.

48:51.290 --> 48:52.423
Also, take this.

48:53.840 --> 48:56.240
Put it in a drawer and only ever use it

48:56.240 --> 48:57.843
unless it's needed, got it?

49:02.326 --> 49:04.070
It gets better, kid.

49:04.070 --> 49:05.420
This is just the beginning.

49:16.009 --> 49:18.926
(insects chirping)

49:23.379 --> 49:26.212
- Elaine, I'm heading out tonight.

49:28.040 --> 49:29.860
I just wanna let you know.

49:29.860 --> 49:30.860
- Where are you going?

49:30.860 --> 49:32.543
- A little town meeting.

49:33.640 --> 49:35.990
- What do you guys do
with these town meetings?

49:37.750 --> 49:40.593
- Ah, the good book.

49:43.110 --> 49:43.943
Indeed.

49:45.700 --> 49:47.603
Come here, let me braid your hair.

49:52.490 --> 49:53.990
- My mom used to braid my hair.

49:53.990 --> 49:57.323
- Hmm, it's beautiful.

49:58.883 --> 50:01.621
Well, you have your father's hair.

50:01.621 --> 50:02.454
Hmm, now.

50:04.983 --> 50:06.833
- Were you close to my father?

50:07.920 --> 50:10.120
- When we were little.

50:10.120 --> 50:11.023
- What happened?

50:13.340 --> 50:15.513
He never mentioned you, ever.

50:18.010 --> 50:20.133
- Well, that's not surprising.

50:21.200 --> 50:24.713
He stopped coming round
after Doc died, your uncle.

50:26.660 --> 50:27.493
- Why?

50:29.133 --> 50:30.260
- I don't know, honey,

50:30.260 --> 50:33.720
he just thought there was
something strange about it all,

50:33.720 --> 50:34.653
I suppose.

50:36.040 --> 50:38.310
You know, Doc just disappeared,

50:38.310 --> 50:40.133
no one ever knew where he went.

50:41.400 --> 50:43.920
Most people think he
just ran off and left me,

50:43.920 --> 50:47.533
but I think something
else happened to him.

50:48.730 --> 50:50.490
I don't know, your daddy always thought

50:50.490 --> 50:51.990
it was some kind of foul play.

50:54.130 --> 50:55.450
Just wouldn't leave me alone about it,

50:55.450 --> 50:57.050
so we sort of had a falling out.

50:59.030 --> 51:00.330
- Why would he think that?

51:01.700 --> 51:02.533
- I don't know.

51:03.380 --> 51:05.763
But never you mind,
that's all in the past.

51:06.810 --> 51:08.343
It's ancient history.

51:13.750 --> 51:14.653
You're pretty,

51:15.920 --> 51:19.090
you just need to wear a
little bit more makeup.

51:19.090 --> 51:20.773
I could show you how to do that.

51:22.170 --> 51:23.003
- Really?

51:23.003 --> 51:24.460
- Well, I'm good with makeup.

51:24.460 --> 51:25.343
Don't you think?

51:27.270 --> 51:28.950
I wear a lot, 'cause I,

51:29.830 --> 51:32.360
I used to get into my mommy's little box.

51:32.360 --> 51:34.760
She had a lot of makeup,
I used to love to play.

51:36.040 --> 51:39.500
I always thought I'd be on the
cover of some fancy magazine

51:39.500 --> 51:40.493
when I grew up.

51:42.480 --> 51:43.930
- You still could.

51:43.930 --> 51:46.000
- No, that never happened.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.812
- I left the south, and I moved here

51:47.812 --> 51:51.120
and Doc and I, we thought
we'd raise a family

51:51.120 --> 51:52.433
and I'd have babies.

51:54.820 --> 51:56.170
- You never wanted children?

51:57.670 --> 51:58.883
- No, I wanted children.

52:00.410 --> 52:01.643
I wanted a daughter.

52:03.230 --> 52:04.063
Like you.

52:07.600 --> 52:09.787
Somethings just aren't meant to be, right?

52:11.470 --> 52:15.910
- Aunt Tilda, what does
Rory think about me?

52:15.910 --> 52:17.270
- Oh my goodness.

52:17.270 --> 52:19.543
I think Rory thinks that you're a beauty.

52:21.110 --> 52:24.440
Just a little bit of blush, lipstick,

52:24.440 --> 52:28.543
and we change your clothes, I
think you'll be irresistible.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.520
And I know he's,

52:31.520 --> 52:33.223
I know he's very fond of you.

52:35.720 --> 52:37.520
- I think my mom would've liked him.

52:39.350 --> 52:42.020
- Doesn't matter what
she would have thought.

52:42.020 --> 52:43.257
He's a special boy.

52:47.240 --> 52:48.073
You're lucky.

52:49.300 --> 52:51.450
He'll make your life
something special too.

52:52.380 --> 52:54.920
(tense music)

52:54.920 --> 52:59.863
Well, I think in the end I
had the last laugh, you see.

53:00.870 --> 53:05.533
I know that you miss your
daddy, I miss him too.

53:07.160 --> 53:09.810
He didn't think I'd amount
to a hill of beans though.

53:11.260 --> 53:14.960
But in the end, he's the one who's dead,

53:14.960 --> 53:17.503
and I've got his daughter.

53:20.380 --> 53:22.793
How about a piece of pie, hmm?

53:24.370 --> 53:25.203
- Sure.

53:25.203 --> 53:26.090
- I'll go get us one.

53:27.974 --> 53:28.950
(tense music)

53:28.950 --> 53:30.370
You sit tight, Elaine.

53:44.160 --> 53:48.483
Tonight is the moment
the town has awaited.

53:49.520 --> 53:51.893
The prophecy Vila prepared me for.

53:54.370 --> 53:58.463
All of these years, I never
questioned the darkness,

53:59.300 --> 54:04.143
the decisions, the sacrificial offerings,

54:06.380 --> 54:10.963
their faces I struggle to forget.

54:13.450 --> 54:17.673
But the power of their flesh consumes me.

54:19.671 --> 54:22.310
(thunder rumbling)
(people chanting)

54:22.310 --> 54:25.347
It came from the earth.

54:27.280 --> 54:30.733
It was always in the earth.

54:34.210 --> 54:36.410
They said the soil was rotten here.

54:38.800 --> 54:42.020
They said the indigenous
worshiped the crows

54:43.480 --> 54:44.893
and their god.

54:47.520 --> 54:49.913
Centuries of sacrifice,

54:51.330 --> 54:53.733
the child from the village was taken.

54:55.200 --> 54:59.223
A vessel to be used by their king.

55:02.650 --> 55:06.033
Re-incarnated into a human child.

55:08.284 --> 55:12.110
A child to be raised by the high priestess

55:12.110 --> 55:13.513
as one of their own.

55:16.380 --> 55:17.903
They said it was magic.

55:19.510 --> 55:21.923
They said it was tradition.

55:23.910 --> 55:27.383
But they would name that
child the chosen one.

55:28.460 --> 55:32.053
And they would sacrifice the birthright.

55:34.150 --> 55:36.263
But they needed the blood of an outsider.

55:37.640 --> 55:39.873
Oh, yeah, they needed me.

55:42.320 --> 55:45.153
(people chanting)

55:57.160 --> 55:59.210
- Jesus, the Slauson family was murdered!

56:01.638 --> 56:03.663
And I just delivered their baby yesterday.

56:08.230 --> 56:11.310
And to think we would get crime
in a small town like this.

56:11.310 --> 56:13.110
That's it, I'm getting us both guns.

56:16.230 --> 56:18.340
- You gonna be home late again tonight?

56:20.490 --> 56:22.923
- Yes, I wouldn't expect me until morning.

56:34.110 --> 56:37.230
- [Tilda] I could sense
a distancin' between us

56:37.230 --> 56:38.513
since losing the baby.

56:39.470 --> 56:40.893
Something wasn't right.

56:47.269 --> 56:49.980
The hospital was closed up that night.

56:49.980 --> 56:53.363
Not a doctor or a nurse in sight.

56:54.587 --> 56:58.770
(Tilda panting)
(somber music)

56:58.770 --> 56:59.743
But Sam appeared.

57:01.780 --> 57:02.613
Oh, yeah.

57:09.120 --> 57:11.120
- I hope you'll make the right decision.

57:19.727 --> 57:20.700
(Tilda laughing)

57:20.700 --> 57:24.723
- [Tilda] He knew everything
that goes on at his hotel.

57:27.753 --> 57:29.529
(door creaking)

57:29.529 --> 57:32.029
(Doc moaning)

57:37.951 --> 57:39.130
(Trixie moaning)

57:39.130 --> 57:42.410
I was foolish to think
that he had changed,

57:42.410 --> 57:45.163
that we were so close to being a family.

57:46.750 --> 57:48.080
- I'm sorry.

57:48.080 --> 57:49.970
- [Tilda] We would never be that!

57:50.851 --> 57:51.915
- [Trixie] Oops.

57:51.915 --> 57:53.707
(Trixie laughing)

57:53.707 --> 57:54.707
- I'm sorry.

57:55.933 --> 57:58.660
I don't remember a thing from that night.

57:58.660 --> 58:00.953
This place is cursed, we
should never have moved here.

58:02.220 --> 58:03.483
Let's leave, let's go.

58:04.693 --> 58:06.128
(people chanting)
Come on, please.

58:06.128 --> 58:08.008
(Doc panting)

58:08.008 --> 58:08.925
I love you.

58:12.976 --> 58:13.893
I love you!

58:15.187 --> 58:16.787
- [Tilda] And I made up my mind.

58:18.110 --> 58:21.343
- I love you!

58:23.338 --> 58:26.560
- [Tilda] I wanted revenge!

58:26.560 --> 58:28.448
(Doc groaning)

58:28.448 --> 58:30.948
(baby crying)

58:52.110 --> 58:57.110
Vila stood before me and
placed the baby in my arms.

59:01.440 --> 59:05.163
- We were gonna name him
Rory, please honor that.

59:06.356 --> 59:08.143
- [Tilda] The king waited.

59:09.270 --> 59:13.033
His transformation not yet complete.

59:14.482 --> 59:17.315
(people chanting)

59:21.724 --> 59:25.891
I stepped into his darkness
as his high priestess.

59:30.610 --> 59:32.183
I had my son.

59:34.260 --> 59:39.260
But now, the darkness and
I would always be one.

59:43.492 --> 59:46.182
(thunder rumbling)

59:46.182 --> 59:51.182
(voice chanting)
(flies buzzing)

1:00:03.203 --> 1:00:05.703
(tense music)

1:00:18.543 --> 1:00:21.376
- [Vila] I am the darkness.

1:00:23.419 --> 1:00:28.419
(dramatic music)
(thunder rumbling)

1:00:37.505 --> 1:00:40.172
(door slamming)

1:00:51.753 --> 1:00:55.003
(floorboards creaking)

1:00:58.680 --> 1:00:59.513
- Aunt Tilda?

1:01:18.959 --> 1:01:23.959
(insects chirping)
(voices whispering)

1:01:31.006 --> 1:01:33.524
(tap creaking)
(tense music)

1:01:33.524 --> 1:01:36.274
(water burbling)

1:01:39.261 --> 1:01:42.594
(ghostly voice moaning)

1:01:47.690 --> 1:01:50.190
(tense music)

1:02:11.392 --> 1:02:14.392
(voices whispering)

1:02:26.690 --> 1:02:29.607
(Elaine screaming)

1:02:32.451 --> 1:02:33.620
Oh, Rory!
- What's going on?

1:02:33.620 --> 1:02:35.946
- Rory, there's someone inside the house!

1:02:35.946 --> 1:02:36.783
- What?
- There's someone

1:02:36.783 --> 1:02:38.488
inside the house!
- Okay, wait right here,

1:02:38.488 --> 1:02:40.142
all right?

1:02:40.142 --> 1:02:40.975
Wait right there.

1:02:40.975 --> 1:02:42.558
- Okay, be careful!

1:02:46.358 --> 1:02:47.191
Oh, Rory.

1:02:48.386 --> 1:02:51.136
(Elaine panting)

1:02:52.376 --> 1:02:53.209
Oh my God.

1:02:55.261 --> 1:02:57.396
(Elaine crying)

1:02:57.396 --> 1:02:59.896
(owl hooting)

1:03:07.224 --> 1:03:08.243
- There ain't no one there.

1:03:08.243 --> 1:03:10.623
- There's someone that
came through that door!

1:03:11.550 --> 1:03:14.109
There's someone that came
through that door, Rory!

1:03:14.109 --> 1:03:15.093
I'm not imagining this stuff, I'm not.

1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:18.727
I see them with my own eyes!

1:03:18.727 --> 1:03:19.923
- All right, shh.

1:03:19.923 --> 1:03:21.303
- Someone's in there.

1:03:21.303 --> 1:03:23.511
- Nothing's gonna happen to
you, calm down, all right.

1:03:23.511 --> 1:03:24.887
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

1:03:24.887 --> 1:03:26.859
- Please don't go!

1:03:26.859 --> 1:03:28.180
- I'm right here, I'm right here.

1:03:30.810 --> 1:03:31.790
Let's go inside.

1:03:31.790 --> 1:03:33.080
- No!

1:03:33.080 --> 1:03:34.725
- I'm right here, ain't
nothing gonna happen to you.

1:03:34.725 --> 1:03:35.677
- No, I'm not going in there!

1:03:35.677 --> 1:03:36.537
- Can you trust me?

1:03:36.537 --> 1:03:38.688
Can you trust me?

1:03:38.688 --> 1:03:39.832
Do you trust me?

1:03:39.832 --> 1:03:40.709
- [Elaine] I don't wanna go inside, Rory!

1:03:40.709 --> 1:03:42.869
- Do you trust me?

1:03:42.869 --> 1:03:46.119
Shh, come on, you're fine, you're fine.

1:03:52.604 --> 1:03:55.271
(door creaking)

1:04:02.293 --> 1:04:07.293
(dramatic music)
(leaves crunching)

1:04:11.823 --> 1:04:16.823
- This is a very joyous
night that we celebrate!

1:04:18.390 --> 1:04:22.133
Over 20 years ago, our king was reborn!

1:04:24.501 --> 1:04:27.640
And now we have been
able to watch him grow up

1:04:27.640 --> 1:04:31.273
to be the perfect man that he is today!

1:04:33.119 --> 1:04:35.562
Our king walks before us!

1:04:35.562 --> 1:04:37.857
(crow cawing)
(crow wings flapping)

1:04:37.857 --> 1:04:41.490
And now, he will choose a bride

1:04:42.649 --> 1:04:44.663
and spread his seed.

1:04:45.497 --> 1:04:47.304
- [Crowd] We honor thy king!

1:04:47.304 --> 1:04:49.054
We worship thy king!

1:04:50.282 --> 1:04:53.303
- As your high priestess, I
grant permission for this feast.

1:04:59.690 --> 1:05:01.123
Now, dig in!

1:05:01.123 --> 1:05:03.790
(man screaming)

1:05:11.356 --> 1:05:13.939
(man gurgling)

1:05:18.376 --> 1:05:21.293
(thunder rumbling)

1:05:24.148 --> 1:05:26.898
(dramatic music)

1:05:39.994 --> 1:05:42.494
(Sam growling)

1:05:44.636 --> 1:05:45.487
(dead twigs breaking)

1:05:46.862 --> 1:05:47.762
- Oh, shit.

1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:13.393
Oh!

1:06:30.459 --> 1:06:31.292
- Get him.

1:06:31.292 --> 1:06:34.125
(people growling)

1:06:48.094 --> 1:06:50.677
(upbeat music)

1:07:03.610 --> 1:07:04.710
- You made that quick.

1:07:07.430 --> 1:07:08.280
- What can I say?

1:07:09.460 --> 1:07:11.010
I know my way around a kitchen.

1:07:12.990 --> 1:07:15.990
- Hmm, is this cinnamon?

1:07:15.990 --> 1:07:20.783
- Cinnamon, hot chocolate, whiskey.

1:07:20.783 --> 1:07:22.720
(both laughing)

1:07:22.720 --> 1:07:24.390
Marshmallows.

1:07:24.390 --> 1:07:25.480
- Do you cook?

1:07:25.480 --> 1:07:28.940
- Yeah, yeah, my mom,

1:07:28.940 --> 1:07:33.380
she used to cook all the
time, so I know my way around.

1:07:33.380 --> 1:07:34.660
- Used to?

1:07:34.660 --> 1:07:36.633
- No, she does, yeah.

1:07:38.809 --> 1:07:40.580
- Well, I'd love to meet her one day.

1:07:40.580 --> 1:07:41.413
- You will.

1:07:44.920 --> 1:07:46.540
So!

1:07:46.540 --> 1:07:47.373
Where were we?

1:07:50.290 --> 1:07:51.123
Alrighty.

1:07:55.290 --> 1:07:58.130
I believe it was your turn first.

1:07:58.130 --> 1:08:01.652
So we'll give the lady her honor.

1:08:01.652 --> 1:08:04.319
(both laughing)

1:08:07.062 --> 1:08:11.500
- Do you ever feel like
your life is a puzzle?

1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:13.350
That you're just one of these pieces?

1:08:14.650 --> 1:08:17.030
(Rory laughing)

1:08:17.030 --> 1:08:18.692
Sorry, is that weird?

1:08:18.692 --> 1:08:21.583
- No, no it's not funny.

1:08:23.180 --> 1:08:25.160
I just think you're a little tired.

1:08:25.160 --> 1:08:26.410
Probably need some sleep.

1:08:28.639 --> 1:08:30.190
- I haven't been able to sleep.

1:08:32.830 --> 1:08:34.680
- Why haven't you been able to sleep?

1:08:37.973 --> 1:08:39.263
- Because I'm scared.

1:08:41.350 --> 1:08:42.500
- You scared right now?

1:08:45.790 --> 1:08:47.139
- Not while you're with me.

1:08:49.044 --> 1:08:51.794

1:09:04.554 --> 1:09:07.054
(tense music)

1:09:13.014 --> 1:09:14.764
I can't see anything.

1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:21.764
- You all right?

1:09:21.764 --> 1:09:22.596
Shh, sit back.

1:09:22.596 --> 1:09:23.871
- I'm tired.

1:09:23.871 --> 1:09:25.792
- I think you're fine.

1:09:25.792 --> 1:09:28.297
- Just gonna sleep, just for a second.

1:09:32.611 --> 1:09:33.443
- Hey.

1:09:39.100 --> 1:09:41.600
(tense music)

1:09:43.089 --> 1:09:44.271
- [Elaine] Where we going?

1:09:44.271 --> 1:09:46.408
- [Rory] Shh, you're all right.

1:09:46.408 --> 1:09:49.076
(door creaking)

1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:55.133
- [Tilda] There once was a
princess and she fell in love.

1:09:56.420 --> 1:09:58.893
You could see it was very easy for her,

1:09:59.730 --> 1:10:03.823
'cause the prince, the
prince was perfect for her.

1:10:06.580 --> 1:10:09.770
And he whisked her away to his castle

1:10:11.110 --> 1:10:13.973
and they lived happily ever after.

1:10:18.504 --> 1:10:21.171
- They lived happily ever after?

1:10:22.820 --> 1:10:24.591
- Yes, my son.

1:10:24.591 --> 1:10:27.341

1:11:06.077 --> 1:11:07.171
- Mom?

1:11:07.171 --> 1:11:08.671
- [Mother] Elaine?

1:11:17.232 --> 1:11:18.065
- Mom?

1:11:21.123 --> 1:11:23.790
(ball rattling)

1:11:37.573 --> 1:11:39.623
- I wouldn't go down there if I were you.

1:11:40.689 --> 1:11:42.022
- But I have to.

1:11:44.166 --> 1:11:46.820

1:16:54.059 --> 1:16:56.593
the king's insemination.

1:16:57.490 --> 1:17:00.053
Of course, she had no
recollection of the ceremony.

1:17:01.180 --> 1:17:02.532
I saw to that.

1:17:03.610 --> 1:17:06.523
Elaine was in my world now.

1:17:07.478 --> 1:17:10.923
Just like a fly in a spider's web.

1:17:16.620 --> 1:17:17.620

1:17:19.097 --> 1:17:20.620
- Ah, Elaine!

1:17:20.620 --> 1:17:23.480
- Hi, is Mr. Delagos in?

1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:25.840
- Oh, he checked out last night.

1:17:25.840 --> 1:17:27.270
- [Elaine] Checked out?

1:17:27.270 --> 1:17:28.660
- Mm-hmm (affirmative).

1:17:28.660 --> 1:17:31.010
- I thought he was staying
until this weekend.

1:17:31.010 --> 1:17:33.570
- Well, I guess he changed his mind.

1:17:33.570 --> 1:17:35.400
- [Elaine] Did he leave a message for me?

1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:36.233
- Nope.

1:17:38.770 --> 1:17:40.889
- He didn't even say goodbye.

1:17:40.889 --> 1:17:44.580
- Well, he was kind of a weird fella, huh?

1:17:44.580 --> 1:17:46.063
Stuck to himself.

1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:47.753
- I guess so.

1:17:49.150 --> 1:17:50.710
Bye, Sam.

1:17:50.710 --> 1:17:51.543
- Elaine.

1:17:53.520 --> 1:17:55.803
So what do you want for Christmas?

1:17:56.648 --> 1:17:57.777
(girl giggling)

1:17:57.777 --> 1:18:00.360
(upbeat music)

1:18:10.718 --> 1:18:14.309
- I think that that is just about perfect.

1:18:14.309 --> 1:18:17.483
Wait, maybe a little in right here.

1:18:26.350 --> 1:18:29.070
Oh, turn it to Country Jesus Radio,

1:18:29.070 --> 1:18:30.660
that's my favorite station.

1:18:30.660 --> 1:18:32.290
- Shirley.

1:18:32.290 --> 1:18:33.521
- [Presenter] John Delagos.

1:18:33.521 --> 1:18:35.330
(Tilda sighing)

1:18:35.330 --> 1:18:36.163

1:18:44.950 --> 1:18:48.639
Mr. Delagos, an African-American
male around 45 years old.

1:18:48.639 --> 1:18:51.120
- Now, honey, you need to let this go.

1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:54.150
- [Presenter] Was last seen
heading to Bloomfield county.

1:18:54.150 --> 1:18:56.590
Authorities are urging
anyone with information

1:18:56.590 --> 1:18:58.639
to please contact the
Irvine Police Department.

1:18:58.639 --> 1:18:59.723
- [Shirley] That's too bad.

1:18:59.723 --> 1:19:03.960
There's a fine line on whether
I was gonna marry that man

1:19:03.960 --> 1:19:05.207
or just eat him up.

1:19:37.790 --> 1:19:40.070
- Oh, Aunt Tilda, he's not even born yet

1:19:40.070 --> 1:19:41.331
and you're already spoiling him.

1:20:15.080 --> 1:20:17.340
- [Rory] I cannot imagine
what it's gonna be like

1:20:17.340 --> 1:20:18.233
to have a son.

1:20:19.230 --> 1:20:21.425
It's everything I ever wanted.

1:20:21.425 --> 1:20:22.800

1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:25.308
You ain't worth shit if you got no sons!

As you go into this time,

1:20:28.680 --> 1:20:31.280
we'd like to offer you a little something

1:20:31.280 --> 1:20:35.050
from your devoted
townsmen to you, our king.

1:20:35.050 --> 1:20:36.083
Duke, bring her out.

1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:43.559
- [Duke] My mayor, my king.

1:20:43.559 --> 1:20:45.553
I'd like to offer you my daughter.

1:20:55.309 --> 1:20:57.893
- You once tried to kill
the mother of my son.

1:20:59.219 --> 1:21:01.370
You cursed the Devil's Juice,

1:21:01.370 --> 1:21:03.293
so that only she gets sick from it.

1:21:04.809 --> 1:21:06.282
Is it not correct, Miranda?

1:21:08.530 --> 1:21:10.950
I could have you sacrificed
at the next town meeting.

1:21:10.950 --> 1:21:12.773
- No, my king!
- But I won't.

1:21:15.120 --> 1:21:16.870
- You are banished from Bloomfield.

1:21:18.290 --> 1:21:19.260
Leave today.

1:21:19.260 --> 1:21:20.093
- But, Rory!

1:21:20.093 --> 1:21:21.330
- Get her out of my sight.

1:21:30.764 --> 1:21:31.932

1:21:34.940 --> 1:21:37.120

1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:38.360

1:25:20.870 --> 1:25:23.013
but I sure will get a piece of you!

1:25:26.840 --> 1:25:29.590
(gunshot firing)

1:26:00.778 --> 1:26:02.778
(upbeat music)

1:26:02.778 --> 1:26:04.768
- That girl got everything she deserves,

1:26:04.768 --> 1:26:06.268
she had it coming.

1:26:07.923 --> 1:26:09.590
- You did good work.

1:26:15.587 --> 1:26:17.170
How you holding up?

1:26:18.496 --> 1:26:21.266
- It was horrible, Rory.

1:26:21.266 --> 1:26:22.427
I thought she was gonna hurt the baby.

1:26:22.427 --> 1:26:23.344
- Shh, shh.

1:26:24.848 --> 1:26:25.931
I'm here now.

1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:32.323
Sheriff, I think it's about
time to be heading back.

1:26:32.323 --> 1:26:33.550
- It's a tragedy what happened.

1:26:33.550 --> 1:26:35.340
Miranda's father's devastated,

1:26:35.340 --> 1:26:38.563
but must've been a hunter
that accidentally shot her.

1:26:39.540 --> 1:26:41.616
Lucky you didn't get hurt, Elaine.

1:26:41.616 --> 1:26:44.616
You shouldn't go out in those woods.

1:26:45.965 --> 1:26:47.071
- Thank you, Sam.

1:26:47.071 --> 1:26:49.071
- Y'all have a nice day.

1:26:53.965 --> 1:26:55.715
- Something is wrong.

1:26:57.696 --> 1:26:58.616
I can feel it.

1:26:58.616 --> 1:27:01.366
(dramatic music)

1:27:32.224 --> 1:27:34.064
- [Duke] Sam.

1:27:34.064 --> 1:27:36.147
She was my only daughter.

1:27:37.639 --> 1:27:38.850
My baby's gone.

1:27:38.850 --> 1:27:42.795
- I'm sorry, Duke, but
Miranda was a rotten apple.

1:27:42.795 --> 1:27:44.183
She did this to herself.

1:27:45.090 --> 1:27:47.840
You just got to watch
out for yourself now.

1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:50.853
If the king even thinks that
you're turning against him,

1:27:51.862 --> 1:27:53.213
you know what'll happen.

1:27:53.213 --> 1:27:54.610
(object scraping)
(metal rattling)

1:27:54.610 --> 1:27:55.660
Let's check that out.

1:28:19.125 --> 1:28:22.208
(machinery rattling)

1:28:35.451 --> 1:28:36.618
- Mr. Delagos?

1:28:39.965 --> 1:28:41.298
Oh, Mr. Delagos!

1:28:43.118 --> 1:28:44.868
Miranda wasn't lying!

1:28:46.655 --> 1:28:51.630
What are you doing down here?
(Footsteps coming down stairs)

1:28:56.848 --> 1:28:59.348
(tense music)

1:29:04.626 --> 1:29:07.727
(Tilda laughing)

1:29:07.727 --> 1:29:10.227
- Oh, Mr. Delagos, my, my, my.

1:29:12.796 --> 1:29:14.463
You stink like piss.

1:29:18.719 --> 1:29:21.323
Boy, you are a sorry sight, aren't you?

1:29:22.420 --> 1:29:24.443
Come on now, wake up for me, honey.

1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:27.370
Come on now, boy.

1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:35.603
Mr. Delagos, you stink.

1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:42.077
You thirsty, hm?

1:29:43.770 --> 1:29:44.883
You thirsty, boy?

1:29:46.309 --> 1:29:48.160
You want a little drink of water, hm?

1:29:49.503 --> 1:29:52.603
Hold on, let me see how this
tastes, you sorry boy, hm.

1:29:54.047 --> 1:29:56.787
Let Auntie take care of you, huh?

1:29:56.787 --> 1:29:59.030
Hm, come on, baby.

1:29:59.030 --> 1:29:59.862
Hm.

1:30:00.770 --> 1:30:02.357
You don't like that?

1:30:03.540 --> 1:30:05.823
You don't like that, Mr. Delagos, huh?

1:30:07.990 --> 1:30:09.989
You smell like piss.

1:30:09.989 --> 1:30:12.739
(Tilda laughing)

1:30:15.469 --> 1:30:16.523
You're pathetic.

1:30:18.589 --> 1:30:21.172
(cup thudding)

1:30:22.529 --> 1:30:25.698
You know, we have finally
decided to kill you.

1:30:25.698 --> 1:30:29.300
Ah, now don't you fret your little soul.

1:30:29.300 --> 1:30:33.920
No, baby, you are gonna be
part of that great celebration

1:30:33.920 --> 1:30:35.585
to our king.

1:30:35.585 --> 1:30:36.749
(Mr. Delagos spitting)

1:30:36.749 --> 1:30:39.499
(Tilda laughing)

1:30:45.027 --> 1:30:45.860
Oh, yeah.

1:30:48.139 --> 1:30:50.213
You are a bad, bad boy.

1:30:56.880 --> 1:30:58.189
Punishment awaits you.

1:30:58.189 --> 1:31:01.439
(Mr. Delagos groaning)

1:31:04.947 --> 1:31:05.780
Bad boy.

1:31:07.737 --> 1:31:10.424
(Mr. Delagos groaning)

1:31:10.424 --> 1:31:12.206
Oh, yeah.

1:31:12.206 --> 1:31:15.456
(Mr. Delagos groaning)

1:31:18.760 --> 1:31:20.323
Punishment awaits you.

1:31:23.398 --> 1:31:24.231
And soon.

1:31:26.340 --> 1:31:28.263
You have a good night, Mr. Delagos.

1:31:35.678 --> 1:31:38.690
- Is Tilda keeping you down here?

1:31:38.690 --> 1:31:40.950
Is she keeping you down here?

1:31:40.950 --> 1:31:42.430
- [Mr. Delagos] Elaine,
is that really you?

1:31:42.430 --> 1:31:44.139
- Yes, it's me, it's me.

1:31:44.139 --> 1:31:45.163
It's me.

1:31:45.163 --> 1:31:47.450
What is she talking about sacrificing you?

1:31:47.450 --> 1:31:49.767
- [Mr. Delagos] We need
to get out of here.

1:31:49.767 --> 1:31:53.070
The keys are over there.

1:31:53.070 --> 1:31:54.700
- I need to tell Rory you're down here.

1:31:54.700 --> 1:31:55.532
- No!

1:31:56.978 --> 1:31:57.812
He knows.

1:31:59.339 --> 1:32:01.219
- That's impossible.

1:32:01.219 --> 1:32:03.302
- [Mr. Delagos] He knows.

1:32:05.559 --> 1:32:06.976
- No, he doesn't.

1:32:11.048 --> 1:32:12.630
- The keys, Elaine.

1:32:15.008 --> 1:32:16.638
- Okay.

1:32:16.638 --> 1:32:19.305
Where are the keys?
- Over there!

1:32:21.499 --> 1:32:26.499
(Elaine crying)
(chains rattling)

1:32:29.867 --> 1:32:30.784
- Shh, shh.

1:32:33.035 --> 1:32:35.785
(dramatic music)

1:32:45.411 --> 1:32:48.161
(dramatic music)

1:33:37.150 --> 1:33:39.870
- You put that down for your baby's sake!

1:33:39.870 --> 1:33:40.702
You hear me?

1:33:42.059 --> 1:33:43.317
- Who are you people?

1:33:44.700 --> 1:33:47.050
- Give me the knife now.

1:33:47.050 --> 1:33:47.883
- [Elaine] No.

1:33:47.883 --> 1:33:50.410
- Drop the knife now!

1:33:50.410 --> 1:33:52.480
I have had enough of your bullshit.

1:33:52.480 --> 1:33:54.350
Now hold her down, right now.

1:33:54.350 --> 1:33:55.183
- No!

1:33:56.440 --> 1:33:58.480
- I gave you plenty of chance.

1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:03.480
I warned you many times,
I'm done with this bullshit.

1:34:04.337 --> 1:34:07.180
Now you are gonna drink this goddamn mix

1:34:07.180 --> 1:34:09.680
and you are gonna do what
I tell you, you hear me?

1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:16.040
I've had enough of her horseshit
to last me my lifetime.

1:34:16.040 --> 1:34:17.690
Now, take her out.

1:34:24.805 --> 1:34:27.305
(tense music)

1:34:33.657 --> 1:34:35.157
Leave us a moment.

1:34:40.134 --> 1:34:42.967
I bet you have a lot of questions.

1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:45.490
- Who are you people?

1:34:46.830 --> 1:34:47.790
Who are you?

1:34:49.950 --> 1:34:52.139
- What happens in this town, Elaine,

1:34:53.059 --> 1:34:56.893
has been going on for
a very, very long time.

1:34:59.967 --> 1:35:03.457
You know that I was just about
your age when I moved here.

1:35:04.340 --> 1:35:06.030
Doc had received a letter

1:35:06.030 --> 1:35:08.740
after graduating from medical school.

1:35:08.740 --> 1:35:10.923
Take a job at this very hospital.

1:35:12.059 --> 1:35:14.490
So we packed up from the south

1:35:14.490 --> 1:35:16.543
and up and moved to Bloomfield.

1:35:19.440 --> 1:35:23.477
Do you know that I got
everything that I ever wanted?

1:35:25.023 --> 1:35:28.913
I got this big, beautiful
house, a loving husband,

1:35:33.510 --> 1:35:36.300
but for some reason I
couldn't have a baby.

1:35:41.330 --> 1:35:44.053
So after considering taking my own life,

1:35:45.210 --> 1:35:48.483
I was confronted by a woman, Vila.

1:35:50.219 --> 1:35:52.139
And she took me deep into those woods

1:35:52.139 --> 1:35:55.893
for this fertility ceremony.

1:35:58.180 --> 1:36:02.862
Well, at first I thought it
was some kind of white magic.

1:36:04.871 --> 1:36:05.943
But I was wrong.

1:36:08.150 --> 1:36:09.850
You see, Elaine,

1:36:09.850 --> 1:36:14.650
I believe that everything
happens for a reason.

1:36:14.650 --> 1:36:18.360
Why, if Doc hadn't gotten that letter,

1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:20.330
we wouldn't have moved to Bloomfield.

1:36:20.330 --> 1:36:22.520
You would've never met Rory

1:36:22.520 --> 1:36:27.013
or been given this
blessed, blessed miracle.

1:36:30.746 --> 1:36:33.163
Oh, what a healthy heartbeat.

1:36:40.154 --> 1:36:43.737
I believe it is all
the divine intervention

1:36:45.906 --> 1:36:46.906
of our king.

1:36:48.706 --> 1:36:49.539
Oh, yeah.

1:36:52.103 --> 1:36:52.937
Oh, yeah.

1:36:57.666 --> 1:37:01.083
Now, you don't have to make this so hard.

1:37:03.335 --> 1:37:06.503
We can go back to the way things were.

1:37:07.763 --> 1:37:09.513
Yeah, Rory misses you

1:37:10.645 --> 1:37:12.062
and he loves you.

1:37:14.764 --> 1:37:17.969
You think I like binding you up, hm?

1:37:17.969 --> 1:37:19.545
Treating you like a prisoner, why-

1:37:19.545 --> 1:37:21.775
- [Elaine] Well, then let me go!

1:37:21.775 --> 1:37:24.862
- You are my family, Elaine.

1:37:26.616 --> 1:37:28.850
And we're the only ones you got.

1:37:28.850 --> 1:37:29.683
- You're wrong.

1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:31.933
I have my baby.

1:37:32.920 --> 1:37:34.923
The best that this can go,

1:37:36.684 --> 1:37:41.684
is that you are gonna play
along for your baby's sake.

1:37:42.834 --> 1:37:45.930
And I promise you, a rich and happy life.

1:37:48.296 --> 1:37:50.213
Or you don't play along

1:37:54.690 --> 1:37:57.680
and I will only let you live

1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:00.163
for as long as that baby needs you.

1:38:01.723 --> 1:38:03.043
It's your choice, dear.

1:38:04.786 --> 1:38:07.362
- You better not even touch my baby!

1:38:07.362 --> 1:38:08.493
- Now, you be careful.

1:38:08.493 --> 1:38:11.253
That baby feels everything
that you do, dear.

1:38:12.300 --> 1:38:13.870
- Good.

1:38:13.870 --> 1:38:15.883
He'll know who he can't trust.

1:38:17.270 --> 1:38:22.270
- Oh, he'll know who we can trust,

1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:23.360
because it'll be me.

1:38:26.500 --> 1:38:29.653
See Rory, he's just a man now.

1:38:31.103 --> 1:38:33.350
But one day very soon,

1:38:33.350 --> 1:38:36.127
he is gonna be the president
of these United States.

1:38:37.232 --> 1:38:40.770
And well, why don't you take a minute

1:38:42.639 --> 1:38:45.090
to think about the life
that you could lead?

1:38:45.090 --> 1:38:46.743
- You murdered your own husband.

1:38:48.809 --> 1:38:50.320
Who else did you kill?

1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:54.643
- If you don't play along with me, Elaine,

1:38:55.780 --> 1:38:58.532
you won't get to watch your son grow up.

1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:03.313
- You're just a witch!

1:39:04.350 --> 1:39:05.750
- You choose wisely, Elaine.

1:39:08.300 --> 1:39:10.600
'Cause I ain't gonna
give you a second chance.

1:39:11.728 --> 1:39:14.043
- Oh, you fucking bitch!

1:39:14.043 --> 1:39:14.876
You witch!

1:39:15.824 --> 1:39:17.407
You're all witches!

1:39:18.382 --> 1:39:20.163
- Oh, darling.

1:39:20.163 --> 1:39:22.413
I'm much more than a witch.

1:39:23.294 --> 1:39:25.210
I own the fucking town.

1:39:30.621 --> 1:39:31.782
- [Elaine] You witch!

1:39:34.361 --> 1:39:35.582
(Elaine crying)

1:39:35.582 --> 1:39:36.880
No.

1:39:36.880 --> 1:39:38.414
- Shut her up.

1:39:38.414 --> 1:39:41.081
(Elaine crying)

1:39:44.323 --> 1:39:48.842
- [Elaine] Aunt Tilda,
Aunt Tilda, you're a bitch!

1:39:48.842 --> 1:39:52.175
Aunt Tilda, you better not touch my son!

1:39:53.357 --> 1:39:54.273
Let me out!

1:40:10.923 --> 1:40:13.423
(tense music)

1:40:15.202 --> 1:40:16.457
(bones cracking)

1:40:16.457 --> 1:40:18.790
- [Vila] Your child is mine!

1:40:22.516 --> 1:40:24.657
- [Rory] Elaine?

1:40:24.657 --> 1:40:25.491
Elaine!

1:40:28.273 --> 1:40:30.070
- [Elaine] Rory?

1:40:30.070 --> 1:40:31.820
- Listen to me, okay?

1:40:33.630 --> 1:40:37.303
I untie you, you get out there,

1:40:38.380 --> 1:40:39.493
and you be my wife.

1:40:42.969 --> 1:40:45.923
You be the mother of our child.

1:40:48.661 --> 1:40:49.960
And we rule this together.

1:40:53.670 --> 1:40:54.903
Do you understand?

1:40:56.030 --> 1:41:01.030
My dear townspeople,
as I stand here today,

1:41:02.910 --> 1:41:06.143
ready to embark on this new adventure,

1:41:07.250 --> 1:41:09.340
I shall remember that you

1:41:10.840 --> 1:41:12.540
are the ones that brought me here.

1:41:13.700 --> 1:41:18.663
As your mayor, your king and your friend,

1:41:21.630 --> 1:41:24.570
I shall depart as a new man,

1:41:24.570 --> 1:41:28.500
ready to make his mark on the world.

1:41:28.500 --> 1:41:31.663
In the end shall we all prosper.

1:41:32.630 --> 1:41:34.053
And when I have my son,

1:41:36.750 --> 1:41:40.421
may long he reign.

1:41:40.421 --> 1:41:42.691
- May long he reign!

1:41:42.691 --> 1:41:45.379
- [Crowd] May long he reign!

1:41:45.379 --> 1:41:47.962
(somber music)

1:42:09.166 --> 1:42:10.249
- This is it.

1:42:11.550 --> 1:42:14.133
(Rory sighing)

1:42:15.290 --> 1:42:16.123
You ready?

1:42:17.230 --> 1:42:18.063
- Yeah.

1:42:19.380 --> 1:42:21.273
Let me just use the
restroom one more time.

1:42:23.029 --> 1:42:25.779
(Elaine sighing)

1:42:27.290 --> 1:42:28.904
- Tilda, can you help her?

1:42:28.904 --> 1:42:29.821
- I got it.

1:42:35.952 --> 1:42:37.036
- This is it.

1:42:41.531 --> 1:42:44.114
(Tilda crying)

1:42:54.857 --> 1:42:56.853
I don't trust her.

1:42:59.120 --> 1:43:01.498
Just so you be careful.

1:43:01.498 --> 1:43:02.843
- I know, I'm okay.

1:43:02.843 --> 1:43:04.175
- No, I mean it.

1:43:06.282 --> 1:43:08.032
- I will be, promise.

1:43:10.030 --> 1:43:10.862
I love you, Mom.

1:43:12.754 --> 1:43:13.704
- I love you, Rory.

1:43:20.333 --> 1:43:23.770
All right, just, it's time then.

1:43:27.209 --> 1:43:28.041
It's time.

1:43:50.340 --> 1:43:53.010
Rory and Elaine packed up their things

1:43:53.010 --> 1:43:56.870
as they prepared for a
new chapter in their life.

1:43:56.870 --> 1:43:59.290
One everyone hoped that ended

1:43:59.290 --> 1:44:02.493
with Rory becoming the
president of the United States.

1:44:07.110 --> 1:44:09.853
- Well, you've chosen wisely.

1:44:11.639 --> 1:44:14.403
My sweet, sweet Elaine.

1:44:18.510 --> 1:44:20.587
- It wasn't hard to choose.

1:44:20.587 --> 1:44:22.491
(somber music)

1:44:22.491 --> 1:44:25.324
(Tilda sniffling)

1:44:42.068 --> 1:44:44.440
- [Rory] Don't cry for me, okay?

1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:46.357
You promise not to cry?

1:44:48.068 --> 1:44:50.909
I'm gonna be back, I promise.

1:44:50.909 --> 1:44:51.742
- I know.

1:44:52.739 --> 1:44:53.656
I love you.

1:44:55.059 --> 1:44:56.392
- [Rory] I know.

1:44:57.840 --> 1:44:59.358
- No one can be.

1:44:59.358 --> 1:45:00.691
- [Rory] No one.

1:45:11.630 --> 1:45:14.213
(Tilda crying)

1:45:36.850 --> 1:45:41.550
- [Tilda] There was one last
thing that my sweet Elaine

1:45:41.550 --> 1:45:43.603
had up her sleeve.

1:45:50.540 --> 1:45:52.100
- Can you pull over?

1:45:52.100 --> 1:45:53.660
I have to go to the restroom.

1:45:53.660 --> 1:45:54.493
- Yeah, sure.

1:45:57.157 --> 1:46:00.157
(indicator beeping)

1:46:10.677 --> 1:46:11.968
(seatbelt whizzing)

1:46:11.968 --> 1:46:14.739
(handbrake clicking)

1:46:14.739 --> 1:46:16.712
(car beeping)

1:46:16.712 --> 1:46:19.462
(birds chirping)

1:46:28.232 --> 1:46:29.065
Elaine, no!

1:46:29.065 --> 1:46:31.815
(gunshot firing)

1:46:40.401 --> 1:46:42.984
(somber music)

1:47:02.251 --> 1:47:03.168
- Hey, hey!

1:47:05.302 --> 1:47:07.316
Hey, do you guys have a phone I could use?

1:47:07.316 --> 1:47:09.388
- We do, but we can't get any service.

1:47:09.388 --> 1:47:10.793
We're just trying to find a bite to eat.

1:47:10.793 --> 1:47:11.626
Do you know where Bloomfield is?

1:47:11.626 --> 1:47:14.433
- Don't go to Bloomfield, trust me.

1:47:21.400 --> 1:47:22.782
- What was wrong with her?

1:47:22.782 --> 1:47:24.290
- I don't know.

1:47:24.290 --> 1:47:28.120
- Oh, my little Elaine
raced out of Bloomfield,

1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:32.230
never turning back on a road to hope

1:47:32.230 --> 1:47:37.053
for a new life with her son,
heading west to California.

1:47:38.230 --> 1:47:41.952
The land of milk and
honey, or so they say.

1:47:43.684 --> 1:47:46.559
But what she doesn't know
is that her Aunt Tilda

1:47:46.559 --> 1:47:49.670
will call the strongest
forces in the universe

1:47:49.670 --> 1:47:53.103
to seek vengeance upon her soul.

1:47:57.750 --> 1:48:00.083
But maybe that's for another chapter,

1:48:02.314 --> 1:48:04.733
for this story has come to an end.

1:48:12.260 --> 1:48:13.633
Mama's coming back.

1:48:27.702 --> 1:48:30.786
(car engine roaring)

1:48:38.897 --> 1:48:39.730
- Howdy!

1:48:41.020 --> 1:48:43.883
Hey, welcome to Bloomfield!

1:48:45.210 --> 1:48:47.735
Y'all need a place to stay?

1:48:47.735 --> 1:48:50.485
(dramatic music)

1:48:53.362 --> 1:48:56.612
("Carol of the Bells")
