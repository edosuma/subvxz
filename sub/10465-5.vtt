so many guys at one time

40:06.167 --> 40:08.367
that you don't know where you
stand with any of them?

40:08.367 --> 40:11.234
And neither do they?

40:11.234 --> 40:12.968
Have you ever thought
of trying the--?

40:12.968 --> 40:14.567
The "I really think
you're a nice guy,

40:14.567 --> 40:16.501
but I'm just not interested"
approach?

40:16.501 --> 40:19.701
I'm just-- I'm not--
I'm not good at that, you know?

40:19.701 --> 40:23.133
Like saying no like that.
It's just...

40:23.133 --> 40:26.067
But you're real good at saying
"maybe" when you mean no.

40:27.834 --> 40:29.701
Why do you think that is?

40:29.701 --> 40:33.868
I think I'll pass
on the psychoanalysis, okay?

40:33.868 --> 40:35.601
But thanks for the insight.

40:36.901 --> 40:37.834
Hey.

40:42.667 --> 40:46.567
I have a feeling you're
one of those girls, aren't you?

40:46.567 --> 40:49.901
One of those
never-a-dull-moment girls.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.834
Don't tell me.

40:55.834 --> 40:58.534
It's the type you're desperately
attracted to?

40:59.968 --> 41:02.300
Nope.

41:02.300 --> 41:04.501
Well, used to be, maybe, but...

41:04.501 --> 41:06.434
[CLEARS THROAT]

41:06.434 --> 41:08.367
...at any rate, we're covered.

41:08.367 --> 41:11.601
We're covered or just...

41:12.534 --> 41:14.133
non-practicing?

41:18.601 --> 41:19.934
[SIGHS]

41:21.834 --> 41:23.968
I'll see you in the morning,
Callie.

41:23.968 --> 41:25.667
[CHUCKLES]

41:25.667 --> 41:26.868
Yeah.

41:26.868 --> 41:28.567
See you in the morning.

41:32.701 --> 41:35.634
[DOOR OPENS]

41:35.634 --> 41:37.567
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

41:39.234 --> 41:40.567
[SIGHS]

41:40.567 --> 41:42.200
Is that the last
of the turkey?

41:42.200 --> 41:45.133
No. No, there's more
in the fridge.

41:46.234 --> 41:48.100
Pickles too.

41:51.834 --> 41:55.000
So how's it going up there?

41:55.000 --> 41:56.200
How's she doing?

41:56.200 --> 41:58.434
It's like...

41:58.434 --> 42:01.133
It always feels like it's a
couple tiny little steps forward

42:01.133 --> 42:03.601
and a whole lot of steps
backwards, you know?

42:03.601 --> 42:06.300
Yeah.

42:06.300 --> 42:08.534
Like you think you're past
the worst of something,

42:08.534 --> 42:09.634
but you're not?

42:09.634 --> 42:12.434
You got it.

42:15.267 --> 42:17.100
How do you know

42:17.100 --> 42:19.067
that you've, like,
got a problem licked

42:19.067 --> 42:20.701
and it's never coming back?

42:23.033 --> 42:25.834
I mean, because I know you
worry about that with Kirsten.

42:25.834 --> 42:27.701
You-- You said you do.

42:27.701 --> 42:29.968
I don't know.
I'm realizing that if I keep

42:29.968 --> 42:31.734
looking down the road
six months or a year

42:31.734 --> 42:33.968
and asking myself if it's
always gonna be like this,

42:33.968 --> 42:36.534
I'm just gonna
drive myself crazy.

42:36.534 --> 42:38.000
So now it's...

42:38.000 --> 42:40.334
It's more of a one-day-at-a-time
kind of thing.

42:40.334 --> 42:42.434
Right.

42:42.434 --> 42:43.734
[CHUCKLES]

42:43.734 --> 42:46.234
Wow, that's kind of
amazingly together.

42:47.601 --> 42:50.033
Yeah, I don't know.

42:50.033 --> 42:52.501
She wants to go off her
medicine, which is pretty bad,

42:52.501 --> 42:55.501
but I'm hanging in.

42:56.868 --> 42:58.767
I can handle it.

42:58.767 --> 42:59.968
I'm gonna be okay.

43:03.667 --> 43:07.000
Well, can I--?

43:07.000 --> 43:08.367
I wanna help.

43:08.367 --> 43:11.334
Can I at least bring her up
some dinner or something?

43:11.334 --> 43:14.100
It's okay. I got it covered.

43:18.534 --> 43:22.200
Y-yes, hello?
Um, Mr. Bennett?

43:22.200 --> 43:25.133
This is Claudia Salinger.

43:25.133 --> 43:26.934
Hi.

43:27.868 --> 43:30.868
I'm calling about your daughter.

43:30.868 --> 43:33.834
No, uh-uh.
E-everything's not okay.

43:33.834 --> 43:35.701
Kirsten's...

43:35.701 --> 43:37.300
She's...

43:38.334 --> 43:39.601
Something's going on,

43:39.601 --> 43:42.467
and something's pretty bad.

43:44.033 --> 43:46.100
The thing is,

43:46.100 --> 43:48.834
I kind of don't think
Charlie can handle it.
