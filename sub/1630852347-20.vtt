but he learned something,
and he vowed go back every day

10:50.441 --> 10:52.902
until he found
what he was looking for.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.528
Oh, no you don't.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.239
You've got
school tomorrow!

10:57.323 --> 10:59.450
Oh, yeah!
I love school!

10:59.533 --> 11:01.911
Yeah, you do!

11:01.994 --> 11:03.287
Bye, everyone!

11:03.371 --> 11:05.581
Thanks for watching!

11:05.664 --> 11:17.426
