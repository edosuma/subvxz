Tommy's is full of holes,

to your mom and maybe that

00:21.736 --> 00:24.271
coonskin cap will be under
your tree Christmas morning,

00:24.339 --> 00:25.939

00:44.626 --> 00:45.959
Well, if he's good enough,

his mother will end up giving it to him.

of happy, shiny faces

11:53.192 --> 11:56.195
to take away the guilt
of locking us away.

11:56.262 --> 11:58.497
You got that backwards,
Mr. Emerson.

11:58.564 --> 12:01.700
The picture is to remind the public

12:01.767 --> 12:03.935
that without Briarcliff,

12:04.003 --> 12:07.906
you would be out there,
living among them.

12:07.973 --> 12:10.542
And that's why you will
be front and center,

12:10.610 --> 12:13.478
shackled...

12:13.546 --> 12:16.181
and under control.

12:18.618 --> 12:20.886
What's he doing?

12:20.953 --> 12:23.121
Who, Sean? He's handing out
the presents like you asked.

12:23.189 --> 12:26.625
He's wearing that silly hat
and that ridiculous beard.

12:26.693 --> 12:28.627
Now, I thought I very was clear

12:28.695 --> 12:30.696
about how I wanted Christmas celebrated.

12:30.764 --> 12:32.731
All respect, Sister, I really
don't see the problem with it.

12:32.799 --> 12:34.000
The-The patients love it,

12:34.067 --> 12:36.236
it makes Sean and the boys happy.

12:36.303 --> 12:38.671
And St. Nicholas
was a saint.

12:38.739 --> 12:39.906
SISTER EUNICE:
The photographer's here!

12:41.375 --> 12:43.776
Sister Jude, the newspaper
photographer is here.

12:43.844 --> 12:46.846
SISTER JUDE:
I thought we decided

12:46.914 --> 12:48.247
that you would bring
him in when we were ready.

12:48.315 --> 12:49.482
I'm sorry.
Are we not ready?

12:57.024 --> 12:58.324
(spitting, yelling)

12:58.392 --> 13:00.293
Take him to the hole!

13:00.361 --> 13:04.431
Oh, you really don't want me
out there with other people

13:04.499 --> 13:05.632
this time of year.

13:05.700 --> 13:06.800
Not as yourself.

13:06.868 --> 13:09.470
Your beard goes perfectly

13:09.537 --> 13:11.405
with the suit.

13:13.808 --> 13:16.509
Jesus, you don't know
what Christmas means to me?

13:16.577 --> 13:17.811
I do now, Leigh.

13:17.879 --> 13:19.613
I know you were a petty criminal

13:19.681 --> 13:22.349
thrown in jail for
shoplifting a loaf of bread,

13:22.417 --> 13:25.418
and while you were in there,

13:25.486 --> 13:30.090
the jailers went caroling
in the cell block,

13:30.157 --> 13:34.427
and five men held you down

13:34.495 --> 13:36.596
and took your virginity.

13:36.664 --> 13:37.797
Well...

13:37.865 --> 13:39.833
the first one did.

13:39.901 --> 13:42.603
The others took your dignity,

13:42.670 --> 13:45.606
and your self-esteem and...

13:45.674 --> 13:48.409
most importantly...

13:48.476 --> 13:50.944
(whispering):
your Christmas spirit.

13:51.012 --> 13:52.112
But then you got out

13:52.180 --> 13:54.148
and you found the suit,

13:54.216 --> 13:56.684
and it gave you everything
you were missing.

13:56.751 --> 13:58.886
You see, I-I knew
who deserved to live

13:58.953 --> 14:00.621
and who deserved to die.

14:00.688 --> 14:01.889
Who was naughty, who was nice.

14:01.956 --> 14:03.623
And you had the power, Leigh.

14:03.691 --> 14:05.959
You can have it again.

14:06.026 --> 14:07.960
Who do you want to be?

14:10.030 --> 14:11.330
The victim...

14:13.725 --> 14:15.536
...or the victor?

14:34.561 --> 14:35.967
(door opens)
ARDEN: Sister.

14:36.087 --> 14:37.855
I hope I'm not interrupting.

14:37.922 --> 14:39.389
Come on in, Arthur.

14:41.566 --> 14:43.493
I was just thinking
about my Christmases.

14:44.338 --> 14:45.554
There were so many of us

14:45.674 --> 14:48.878
that all we got was a
tangerine and socks.

14:49.362 --> 14:52.369
Did you celebrate Christmas
in your Nazi household?

14:53.871 --> 14:56.773
We had wonderful Christmases
when I was a boy.

14:56.841 --> 15:01.311
They're some of fondest
childhood memories.

15:01.379 --> 15:03.280
And in that spirit,

15:03.348 --> 15:04.881
I've brought you a Christmas present

15:04.949 --> 15:07.785
since you've now become my family.

15:07.852 --> 15:09.586
You're joking!

15:09.654 --> 15:12.189
How adorable!

15:12.257 --> 15:14.125
Is it Tabu perfume?

15:17.630 --> 15:18.563
Open it.

15:18.630 --> 15:20.431
I think you'll be pleased.

15:20.499 --> 15:22.233
Well, knowing you, it's probably

15:22.301 --> 15:24.135
some cheap toilet water
from the Woolworth's.

15:24.203 --> 15:25.436
Yardley's Lavender.

15:25.504 --> 15:27.438
Christ, why even get my hopes up.

15:29.008 --> 15:31.642
Well... la-dee-da.

15:34.613 --> 15:37.082
Mother of God, are they real?

15:37.149 --> 15:39.785
Very.

15:39.853 --> 15:43.456
Rubies are the most glamorous of all.

15:43.523 --> 15:45.224
You couldn't have found them
in this dreary town.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.860
Are they family heirlooms?

15:47.928 --> 15:50.830
They belonged to a Jewess in the camp.

15:50.898 --> 15:54.567
She was always reminding
people that she was

15:54.635 --> 15:56.669
a woman of considerable means,
and that her husband was

15:56.737 --> 16:00.340
an influential and
wealthy doctor in Berlin.

16:00.407 --> 16:03.276
She was constantly complaining to me

16:03.343 --> 16:05.611
about her stomach problems,

16:05.679 --> 16:09.983
and as a doctor, I thought I
ought to do something about it.

16:10.050 --> 16:13.487
So I followed her, one day,
to the latrine,

16:13.554 --> 16:15.255
thinking I might diagnose her condition

16:15.323 --> 16:17.725
if I had a stool sample.

16:17.793 --> 16:19.460
She was in there,

16:19.528 --> 16:22.063
on her hands and knees,

16:22.131 --> 16:24.432
picking through her own feces

16:24.499 --> 16:25.967
to retrieve those earrings.

16:27.269 --> 16:30.505
She confessed to me
that she swallowed them

16:30.573 --> 16:33.475
every day, day after day,

16:33.542 --> 16:35.610
carrying them around inside of her,

16:35.678 --> 16:38.713
as if, someday, she might return

16:38.781 --> 16:40.081
to her former grandeur.

16:40.149 --> 16:42.817
Poor, ridiculous woman,

16:42.885 --> 16:45.587
she died from internal bleeding.

16:45.655 --> 16:48.990
The earrings were
very hard on her intestines.

16:49.058 --> 16:52.359
Obviously, I retrieved them.

16:52.427 --> 16:55.797
I knew someday I'd meet
someone who was worthy

16:55.865 --> 16:57.632
of their exceptional beauty.

16:57.700 --> 17:00.602
You were very clever
to retrieve them, Arthur.

17:03.172 --> 17:05.373
Look how beautiful they are on me.

17:07.343 --> 17:08.777
They bring out the rose in my cheeks.

17:12.548 --> 17:14.182
Oh...

17:14.250 --> 17:15.751
you're such a sap.

17:15.818 --> 17:17.085
(chuckling)

17:17.153 --> 17:20.522
Not exactly for the reasons
you may think,

17:20.589 --> 17:25.828
but a sap nonetheless.

17:25.896 --> 17:28.531
I so dearly hoped you'd
throw them back in my face,

17:28.599 --> 17:30.433
that you couldn't bring
yourself to touch

17:30.501 --> 17:32.435
those shit-stained earrings.

17:32.503 --> 17:35.305
I was hoping there'd be
a glimmer of horror,

17:35.373 --> 17:38.976
a glimmer of that precious girl

17:39.043 --> 17:41.178
who was too afraid

17:41.246 --> 17:42.780
even to take a bite

17:42.848 --> 17:44.482
of my candy apple...

17:44.550 --> 17:45.683
You're pathetic.

17:45.751 --> 17:48.786
And gee whiz,

17:48.854 --> 17:50.555
I just hate to break it to you...

17:53.325 --> 17:56.094
...but you're
no angel either.

17:56.162 --> 18:00.065
Now... I have work to do,

18:00.133 --> 18:02.401
and you're either with me,

18:02.469 --> 18:05.204
or you're against me.

18:05.272 --> 18:08.208
And if you're against me,

18:08.275 --> 18:10.243
even God can't help you.

18:17.318 --> 18:18.618
(coughing)
The cook has a terrible habit

18:18.686 --> 18:21.021
of forgetting to wash his hands.

18:21.088 --> 18:22.522
I keep telling him...

18:22.590 --> 18:24.223
I haven't eaten anything.

18:24.291 --> 18:26.459
I'm just upset.

18:26.527 --> 18:29.729
I need to know if Sister Mary
Eunice talked to the police.

18:29.796 --> 18:32.198
If Sister Mary Eunice says
she's going to do something,

18:32.266 --> 18:34.266
then you have to believe
it has been done.

18:34.334 --> 18:36.869
You need to stop fretting.

18:36.937 --> 18:38.972
(whispering voice)

18:39.039 --> 18:40.907
KIT (muttering):
You died.

18:40.975 --> 18:43.477
Who is that back there?

18:43.544 --> 18:47.080
Another unfortunate soul.

18:47.148 --> 18:48.882
Nothing you need to
worry yourself about.

18:52.353 --> 18:53.720
I feel much better.

18:55.490 --> 18:56.790
Thank you.

19:00.962 --> 19:02.663
(church bell tolling)

19:02.730 --> 19:03.830
I don't know what to do for you, Jude.

19:03.898 --> 19:06.333
You've lost your credibility
at Briarcliff.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.435
I want to help you,
but I don't know how.

19:08.503 --> 19:10.937
You've got to help me
get back into Briarcliff.

19:11.005 --> 19:12.439
I don't know, Jude.

19:12.506 --> 19:14.207
Look at me.

19:14.275 --> 19:16.743
Don't I look different?

19:16.811 --> 19:20.248
I'm not running anymore,

19:20.315 --> 19:24.585
and God had a plan for me all along:

19:24.653 --> 19:26.854
to be a soldier in His army,

19:26.922 --> 19:29.190
but we're losing that war.

19:29.258 --> 19:30.525
Did you know

19:30.593 --> 19:33.561
The National Broadcasting
Company is showing

19:33.628 --> 19:37.097
<i>Rudolph the Red-Nosed</i>
<i>Reindeer</i> this very week?

19:37.165 --> 19:38.932
Nothing about Christ,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.434
nothing about the nativity story.

19:41.502 --> 19:46.706
This country's turn
towards unadulterated blasphemy

19:46.773 --> 19:48.641
frightens me.

19:48.709 --> 19:51.344
It worries me deeply,

19:51.411 --> 19:53.279
but that's how the Devil works.

19:53.347 --> 19:55.314
Bit by bit,

19:55.382 --> 19:58.784
he turns our eyes away from God,

19:58.852 --> 20:01.120
but he can't have her!

20:02.856 --> 20:04.290
No.

20:04.357 --> 20:06.091
I will do what I can.

20:06.159 --> 20:07.926
I promise, Jude.

20:07.994 --> 20:10.362
(phone ringing)

20:10.429 --> 20:11.863
Yes?

20:11.931 --> 20:13.331
(bell tolling)

20:13.399 --> 20:16.134
Thank you.

20:16.201 --> 20:18.302
You have a visitor.

20:18.370 --> 20:20.604
(bell tolling)

20:24.809 --> 20:28.312
I can't remember the last time
I was in a house of worship.

20:28.380 --> 20:30.915
Why are you here?
You and I got off

20:30.982 --> 20:33.384
on the wrong foot
right from the very beginning.

20:33.451 --> 20:35.653
Perhaps it's because we're both such

20:35.721 --> 20:38.089
strong personalities.

20:38.156 --> 20:40.892
But although our ideologies may differ,

20:40.959 --> 20:42.493
I believe our commitment

20:42.561 --> 20:44.162
to Briarcliff is equally matched.

20:44.229 --> 20:46.631
What is this?
I think you must know

20:46.699 --> 20:48.466
how hard it was for me to come here,

20:48.534 --> 20:51.003
to turn to you, of all people.

20:51.070 --> 20:52.704
I don't have time for the prologue.

20:52.772 --> 20:54.439
Just say it!

20:56.309 --> 20:58.677
You were right.

20:58.745 --> 21:00.379
About Sister Mary Eunice.

21:00.446 --> 21:03.582
She's in desperate trouble.

21:03.650 --> 21:06.085
I had hoped to come up

21:06.153 --> 21:08.420
with a medical explanation
for it, but...

21:08.488 --> 21:09.722
I can't.

21:09.789 --> 21:11.757
(thud echoing)

21:15.595 --> 21:17.962
(sighs)

21:18.030 --> 21:19.564
She doesn't know I'm here.

21:19.632 --> 21:21.299
You're afraid of her.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.001
No.
No?

21:23.068 --> 21:24.902
That's not it.

21:24.970 --> 21:27.004
I have my work to do.

21:27.072 --> 21:30.040
I can't be baby-sitting
a deranged nun all day long.

21:30.108 --> 21:31.675
That's what you came for?

21:31.743 --> 21:33.243
A baby-sitter?

21:33.311 --> 21:35.946
Yeah. Well, go to hell.

21:38.616 --> 21:40.117
You were right about me, too.

21:41.519 --> 21:43.720
I don't believe in God.

21:43.787 --> 21:45.922
But I do believe in evil.

21:47.287 --> 21:50.160
I've seen it...

21:50.227 --> 21:52.429
up-close and personal.

21:52.497 --> 21:55.065
I have no doubt.

21:55.133 --> 21:57.601
That's why her purity meant
so much to me.

21:57.669 --> 22:00.237
She had this...

22:00.305 --> 22:02.907
light in her.

22:02.974 --> 22:05.242
The light's gone out.

22:06.978 --> 22:08.946
Please--

22:09.013 --> 22:11.181
and that's not a word
I use often--

22:11.249 --> 22:13.417
I'm begging you,

22:13.484 --> 22:15.252
please help me.

22:15.319 --> 22:18.589
I'm doing this for her, not you.

22:20.392 --> 22:22.126
You must follow my every instruction.

22:22.194 --> 22:23.761
No questions asked.

22:23.828 --> 22:24.862
You swear to me?

22:24.929 --> 22:27.331
I swear.

22:30.068 --> 22:31.769
♪ O, holy night... ♪

22:31.837 --> 22:33.504
There you go.
Thank you.

22:33.572 --> 22:34.939
♪ The stars are
brightly shining... ♪

22:35.007 --> 22:36.974
(speaking quietly)
...Merry Christmas.

22:37.042 --> 22:38.609
I'd like to present you all

22:38.677 --> 22:41.145
with this star,

22:41.213 --> 22:45.015
this... beacon

22:45.082 --> 22:47.084
of Bethlehem.

22:47.152 --> 22:50.354
It was hand-crafted
for the Archdiocese of Boston.

22:50.421 --> 22:52.623
I've decided that this year,

22:52.690 --> 22:53.990
it should hang on your tree.

22:54.058 --> 22:55.925
(applause)

22:55.993 --> 22:58.094
Yes, please... (laughs)

23:00.164 --> 23:02.498
What a triumph.

23:02.566 --> 23:05.168
You've renewed these halls, Sister.

23:05.235 --> 23:07.871
Even your tree shows imagination
and resourcefulness...

23:07.938 --> 23:09.606
(gentle laugh)

23:09.673 --> 23:13.276
...filled with the very icons
of their lives.

23:13.344 --> 23:17.180
It reminds me of Marcel Duchamp
and the school

23:17.248 --> 23:18.981
of found object art.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.917
So clever and
forward-thinking.

23:20.984 --> 23:22.618
(whispers):
Just what's been missing.

23:22.686 --> 23:25.021
(whispering):
Thank you, Monsignor.

23:25.089 --> 23:26.856
I've had these ideas for a while.

23:26.924 --> 23:28.791
Oh, and Leigh Emerson.

23:28.859 --> 23:30.493
Mm.

23:30.561 --> 23:32.996
I must confess, I was more
than a little concerned

23:33.063 --> 23:35.966
with your instincts to offer
him Christmas largesse.

23:36.033 --> 23:38.135
Yes.
But look at him.

23:38.202 --> 23:39.636
A renewed soul.

23:39.704 --> 23:42.205
What do you say, we blow this pop stand,

23:42.273 --> 23:45.442
go savage a few elves and
then suck on each other, hmm?

23:45.510 --> 23:47.377
MONSIGNOR:
So, Arthur?

23:47.445 --> 23:50.647
Monsignor.

23:50.715 --> 23:54.285
There is a palpable spirit
of love and joy in this room.

23:54.353 --> 23:58.155
What say we put aside
our... difficulties

23:58.223 --> 24:03.427
and celebrate
this successful transition?

24:03.495 --> 24:05.096
Our young

24:05.164 --> 24:06.497
Sister Mary Eunice

24:06.565 --> 24:09.501
is quite a treasure, isn't she?

24:09.569 --> 24:13.472
That she is, more than
you can possibly imagine.

24:13.540 --> 24:15.474
Frank, we need you up here, and, uh,

24:15.542 --> 24:17.176
bring the ladder.

24:18.678 --> 24:20.046
(Sister Mary Eunice sighs)

24:20.113 --> 24:22.782
I want to hang this star

24:22.850 --> 24:25.385
before the entertainment portion
of our party.

24:25.453 --> 24:28.254
We are watching <i>Rudolph</i>
<i>the Red-Nosed Reindeer</i> tonight.

24:28.322 --> 24:30.523

24:46.507 --> 24:48.308
I got a bun in that oven.

24:48.376 --> 24:50.610
Really? I thought I was
just eating too much pie.

24:50.678 --> 24:52.145
Keep eating.

24:52.213 --> 24:54.647
I want that kid
to pop out fat and happy.

24:54.715 --> 24:56.216

24:56.283 --> 24:58.318
But it's not.

24:58.386 --> 24:59.953

25:08.028 --> 25:10.296
I just have a hunch.

25:10.364 --> 25:13.166
I want to teach this kid baseball.

25:13.234 --> 25:14.701
And football.

25:14.769 --> 25:15.936
And how to change a tire.

25:17.272 --> 25:20.007
What? I can't teach him.

25:20.074 --> 25:22.342
Grace.
(laughs)

25:22.410 --> 25:23.744
What's this about?
I'm so sorry, Grace.

25:23.812 --> 25:25.312
I should have stayed gone.

25:25.380 --> 25:26.881
If I hadn't come back...

25:26.948 --> 25:28.783
Shh. Who cares about that?

25:30.353 --> 25:32.687
Dance with me.

25:40.596 --> 25:41.763
LANA (whispers):
<i>Kit...</i>

25:41.831 --> 25:45.100
Kit, can you hear me?

25:48.971 --> 25:51.539
They're saying you escaped custody.

25:51.607 --> 25:53.608
I heard on the radio there's a manhunt.

25:53.676 --> 25:56.144
The police are still looking for you.

25:58.081 --> 26:00.315
Oh, God.

26:01.751 --> 26:03.852
If they don't know you're here,

26:03.920 --> 26:06.121
they don't know
what happened to me, either.

26:08.558 --> 26:11.526
No one <i>is</i> coming for either of us.

26:11.594 --> 26:14.529
And he's still out there.

26:14.597 --> 26:17.364
Grace?

26:17.432 --> 26:19.733
No, Kit.

26:19.801 --> 26:23.070
It's Lana.
I haven't seen Grace.

26:23.138 --> 26:25.305
I don't know where she is.

26:25.373 --> 26:26.707
Dead.

26:26.775 --> 26:28.342
What?

26:28.410 --> 26:31.145
Grace is dead.

26:34.149 --> 26:36.383
We have to get you out of here.

26:36.451 --> 26:39.419
We <i>both</i> have to get out of here.

26:39.487 --> 26:42.489
They've got you doped up.

26:45.860 --> 26:48.361
I just have to get to a telephone.

26:48.429 --> 26:49.729
I need to call the police.

26:49.797 --> 26:51.131
They're gonna fry me.

26:51.198 --> 26:53.834
No. No one is going
to fry you, Kit.

26:53.902 --> 26:57.038
You're innocent, and I can prove it.

26:58.540 --> 27:00.441
It was Thredson.

27:00.509 --> 27:01.775
What?

27:01.843 --> 27:05.012
He murdered those women, not you.

27:06.447 --> 27:08.582
He took me, Kit.

27:08.650 --> 27:11.718
He showed me where he did it.

27:11.786 --> 27:14.388
It was him.

27:14.455 --> 27:18.692
That's why he got himself
appointed to your case--

27:18.760 --> 27:21.695
to get you to confess to
crimes that he committed.

27:23.398 --> 27:25.199
Did he hurt you?

27:26.569 --> 27:29.204
They need to know.

27:29.272 --> 27:32.741
They have to get there
before he does it again.

27:32.809 --> 27:34.576
And before he destroys the evidence.

27:34.644 --> 27:35.944
I have to get to the phone.

27:36.012 --> 27:38.080
Lana...?

27:39.316 --> 27:41.451
Are you really here?

27:41.518 --> 27:44.062
I'm really here.

27:45.089 --> 27:46.568
And I'm coming back.

28:13.170 --> 28:16.772
You kept your word, Dr. Arden.

28:16.840 --> 28:20.109
Where is Sister Mary Eunice now?

28:20.177 --> 28:23.879
In the common room,
hosting a Christmas party.

28:23.947 --> 28:27.382
She should be stopped,
for that reason alone.

28:27.450 --> 28:29.751
You sure you don't need any help?

28:29.819 --> 28:31.586
No. Only I can reach her.

28:31.654 --> 28:33.988
I just need time.

28:34.056 --> 28:35.756
Bring her to my office.

28:35.824 --> 28:38.092
Lock the door.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.662
And don't let anyone interrupt us.

28:40.730 --> 28:42.797
Consider it done.

28:44.667 --> 28:46.367
I never thought I would see it.

28:46.435 --> 28:48.803
What's that?

28:48.871 --> 28:51.038
The day you and I would work together.

28:55.945 --> 28:58.213
Coming through.

28:58.281 --> 29:00.582
(crowd chatter)

29:03.353 --> 29:05.888
Sister Mary Eunice, you
really have stepped out

29:05.956 --> 29:07.723
from the shadow of Sister Jude,

29:07.790 --> 29:10.092
shining brighter
than anyone could imagine.

29:10.160 --> 29:11.860
Thank you, Monsignor.

29:11.928 --> 29:14.329
Oh, if you could stay
just a little bit longer,

29:14.397 --> 29:17.265
Frank is about to put
your star on the tree.

29:17.333 --> 29:19.601
Oh, no, Sister,
like the mythical jolly old elf,

29:19.668 --> 29:22.403
I, too, have more than one visit
on this festive night, but

29:22.471 --> 29:24.739
I am happy and grateful

29:24.807 --> 29:27.408
to leave Briarcliff
in your capable hands.

29:28.777 --> 29:30.645
Okay, hand me the star.

29:36.118 --> 29:38.052
Oh!

29:38.120 --> 29:39.687
(gasps)

29:39.754 --> 29:43.357
(grunts)

29:44.559 --> 29:45.626
MAN:
Get down!

29:47.195 --> 29:48.730
(grunting)

29:48.798 --> 29:51.266
Two steps forward, one step back.

29:51.333 --> 29:52.467
(grunting)

29:52.534 --> 29:54.435
Frank, you all right?

29:54.502 --> 29:55.636
Yeah. I'm fine.

29:55.704 --> 29:56.837
Can you take him to solitary?

29:56.905 --> 29:57.938
I'd be glad to.

29:59.274 --> 30:00.307
(grunts)

30:00.375 --> 30:01.708
Get him up.

30:01.776 --> 30:03.277
Turn him around.

30:05.913 --> 30:07.047
FRANK:
All right.

30:08.816 --> 30:11.018
Sister Mary Eunice,
there's a pressing matter

30:11.086 --> 30:13.854
in your office that
needs your attention.

30:18.727 --> 30:20.361
(door creaks softly)

30:36.377 --> 30:38.378
Hope you're not planning
on making a toll call.

30:42.950 --> 30:46.218
Hey, Frankie, what about the outfit?

30:46.286 --> 30:48.588
Sister's instructions were just
to throw you back in your hole.

30:48.655 --> 30:51.624
Do not open until the next
Christmas after never.

30:51.692 --> 30:55.494
Go rot in there, you bastard.

30:55.562 --> 30:56.862
He give you any trouble?

30:56.930 --> 30:59.365
No, Sister.
Oh...

30:59.433 --> 31:01.167
(whispers):
I think he did.

31:08.841 --> 31:10.208
(sighs)

31:10.276 --> 31:13.411
Now...

31:13.479 --> 31:15.947
how did this get in the building?

31:16.014 --> 31:19.951
I pray we're not looking at a rampage.

31:20.019 --> 31:21.386
(wheezing laugh)

31:24.590 --> 31:26.624
(praying quietly)

31:33.432 --> 31:34.399
(door closes)

31:43.576 --> 31:44.384
What are you doing here?

31:44.504 --> 31:47.145
I'm here to open my present.

31:51.150 --> 31:53.285
♪ ♪

31:57.857 --> 32:01.160
I trust now my loyalty
is no longer in question.

32:17.180 --> 32:19.181
Ho, ho, ho.

32:19.249 --> 32:20.783
(Leigh grunts)

32:21.852 --> 32:22.985
(rattling doorknob)

32:23.053 --> 32:24.454
(pounding on door)

32:25.658 --> 32:27.625
SISTER JUDE:
Dr. Arden, open this door!

32:27.693 --> 32:29.681
I'd put the lion's share of blame

32:29.801 --> 32:32.430
on that sexy Little Sister.

32:32.497 --> 32:34.232
She <i>really</i>

32:34.300 --> 32:36.734
doesn't like you.
What's this all about?

32:36.802 --> 32:40.037
You left me in that hole to rot.

32:40.105 --> 32:41.205
But you're out now.

32:41.273 --> 32:42.873
Anything is possible.

32:42.941 --> 32:46.542
Let me pray with you.
I think I'd rather tell you

32:46.662 --> 32:47.983
about my fantasies,

32:48.050 --> 32:49.565
like the one where I jam

32:49.685 --> 32:52.394
this gigantic crucifix
up your ass, or the other one

32:52.514 --> 32:55.056
where I take my rotting teeth

32:55.124 --> 32:57.726
and my foul-breathed mouth

32:57.793 --> 32:59.527
and chomp down

32:59.595 --> 33:01.763
on your dried-up...

33:01.830 --> 33:03.198
Help me! Please!

33:03.265 --> 33:04.365
Oh, Sister, where's your sense

33:04.485 --> 33:05.667
of Christmas spirit?

33:05.735 --> 33:07.001
I'm just beginning

33:07.069 --> 33:09.304
to feel the comfort and joy!

33:09.372 --> 33:10.973
SISTER JUDE:
Help me!

33:11.040 --> 33:12.674
Dear God, someone help me!

33:12.742 --> 33:14.243
Anyone, help me!

33:14.310 --> 33:17.479
Does this offend
your delicate sensibilities?

33:19.750 --> 33:21.918
Actually, I find it rather tedious.

33:21.985 --> 33:23.853
Now, if you'll excuse me,

33:23.921 --> 33:27.923
I have more pressing
matters to take care of.

33:27.991 --> 33:29.858
(sighs softly)

33:32.128 --> 33:34.496
How did you find me?
Well, you were

33:34.563 --> 33:36.230
in a car accident, Lana.

33:36.298 --> 33:37.832
The details were in all the papers.

33:39.201 --> 33:41.002
"Escaped mental patient returned

33:41.070 --> 33:42.670
to ward."

33:42.738 --> 33:44.105
You'll never get away with it,

33:44.172 --> 33:45.940
not as long as I have a voice.

33:46.007 --> 33:47.641
Is that what you were doing
on the phone?

33:47.709 --> 33:49.243
You were going to call the police?

33:49.310 --> 33:51.945
You know what I've been
doing since you left me?

33:52.013 --> 33:53.881
I've been mourning.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.585
You made me kill Bloody Face.

33:57.653 --> 33:59.454
I've been through every inch

33:59.522 --> 34:02.691
of my house with a toothbrush
cleaning up-- no...

34:02.759 --> 34:04.059
bone, no...

34:04.127 --> 34:06.395
skin, no... drop
of blood escaped

34:06.463 --> 34:07.963
my scrutiny, and the furnace

34:08.030 --> 34:09.831
has been burning red-hot,
believe me.

34:09.899 --> 34:11.233
You haven't made me disappear.

34:11.300 --> 34:12.333
I'm a witness.

34:12.402 --> 34:13.467
To the courts?

34:13.536 --> 34:16.004
An unreliable one at best.

34:16.072 --> 34:18.407
In fact, I <i>was</i> just gonna let you talk.

34:18.475 --> 34:20.743
With no hard evidence, who
do you think they'll believe,

34:20.811 --> 34:22.878
the doctor or the patient?
But then I thought

34:22.946 --> 34:24.213
about how you betrayed me.

34:25.716 --> 34:27.684
I opened my heart to you,

34:27.751 --> 34:29.585
I told you my story,

34:29.652 --> 34:31.054
and you used it to confuse me.

34:31.121 --> 34:32.856
You made me give you

34:32.924 --> 34:35.092
my intimacy, and that is a wrong

34:35.159 --> 34:37.226
that I need to make right.

34:37.295 --> 34:39.096
You're insane.

34:39.164 --> 34:42.500
Everyone is gonna be able to see that.

34:42.568 --> 34:44.802
I've lost so much recently, I feel like

34:44.870 --> 34:47.205
I've been set adrift in
the open sea-- but now...

34:47.272 --> 34:50.074
that you're here...

34:50.141 --> 34:53.110
so close to me again, well...

34:53.178 --> 34:56.513
I feel like I've been found.

34:56.581 --> 34:59.249
(Lana gasping)

34:59.317 --> 35:01.285
(crying)

35:01.353 --> 35:03.821
(muffled shout)
Shh.

35:06.391 --> 35:08.960
Do you believe in fate, Lana?

35:09.027 --> 35:11.796
Hmm?
(muffled sobbing)

35:11.864 --> 35:14.699
We've been drawn together like
magnets, and I must admit

35:14.766 --> 35:16.801
I didn't fully understand why until now.

35:16.868 --> 35:19.837
But like the Phoenix,
who had to turn to ashes...

35:19.905 --> 35:23.474
Bloody Face had to burn
so he could be born again.

35:25.845 --> 35:27.813
And your skin...

35:27.880 --> 35:31.316
will be the start of a
whole new Bloody Face.

35:31.384 --> 35:33.819
(Lana wails)

35:33.887 --> 35:35.955
(gasping)

35:39.460 --> 35:41.161
(panting)

35:41.229 --> 35:42.563
LEIGH:
<i>It's just you</i>

35:42.631 --> 35:43.998
and me, Sister.
God's off

35:44.066 --> 35:46.033
having schnapps with the nice Santa.

35:46.101 --> 35:47.235
I'm not the enemy.

35:47.303 --> 35:49.704
You're not the <i>only</i> enemy,

35:49.771 --> 35:51.906
you just happen to be the one
I'm focusing on right now.

35:51.973 --> 35:52.906
Whee!

35:56.478 --> 35:58.946
("Carol of the Bells" playing)

35:59.014 --> 35:59.980
(cane striking)
(gasps, groans)

36:02.217 --> 36:03.484
I take that back.

36:03.552 --> 36:05.953
Maybe God <i>is</i> here,

36:06.021 --> 36:07.622
and...

36:07.690 --> 36:09.524
he's giving me a sign.

36:10.826 --> 36:12.928
("Carol of the Bells" continues)

36:16.465 --> 36:18.099
(quietly):
Oh, yeah.

36:18.167 --> 36:20.068
Yeah...

36:20.136 --> 36:22.771
My welts never healed.
(groaning)

36:22.839 --> 36:24.306
No sunlight,

36:24.373 --> 36:26.374
no medicine, no bathing,

36:26.442 --> 36:27.743
and you never, (Sister Jude grunts)

36:27.810 --> 36:29.645
ever checked on me!

36:29.712 --> 36:30.812
Not once!

36:30.880 --> 36:32.948
They're putrid now.

36:33.015 --> 36:34.917
They're seeping pus.

36:34.984 --> 36:38.020
Maybe I'll have you lick them
after I'm done, huh?

36:38.088 --> 36:39.521
(Sister Jude groans)

36:39.589 --> 36:42.391
Remember what you said? Huh?

36:42.459 --> 36:44.026
SISTER JUDE:
<i>We're going to soften you up</i>

36:44.094 --> 36:45.995
so God doesn't have to work so hard

36:46.063 --> 36:47.596
to enter you with His light.

36:47.664 --> 36:48.330
(cane striking)

36:48.398 --> 36:49.331
Guess what?

36:49.399 --> 36:52.134
There is no God.

36:52.201 --> 36:53.168
(whimpers)

36:53.236 --> 36:54.603
But there is a Santa Claus.

36:54.670 --> 36:55.604
(cane striking)

36:55.671 --> 36:56.871
We have to kill him.

36:58.641 --> 36:59.774
(groans)

36:59.842 --> 37:01.075
Wait, wait, wait a second...

37:01.143 --> 37:03.345
Wait a second...
stop it...

37:03.412 --> 37:05.213
Stop!
You have to let me do this.

37:05.281 --> 37:07.849
We need him.

37:07.916 --> 37:10.051
He's the only thing standing between me

37:10.118 --> 37:11.085
and the electric chair.

37:17.493 --> 37:19.227
Why is there still a manhunt?

37:20.764 --> 37:23.065
Why haven't they turned you in?

37:38.149 --> 37:40.984
(loud, harsh buzzing)

37:43.922 --> 37:45.923
(groaning)

37:47.259 --> 37:48.793
(gasping, groaning)

37:50.429 --> 37:51.428
(beep)

37:51.496 --> 37:53.998
(buzzing stops)

37:55.567 --> 37:58.369
("Carol of the Bells" fades in)

37:58.437 --> 38:00.371
(gasping)

38:00.438 --> 38:02.006
Are we having fun yet?

38:02.073 --> 38:04.375
Have you softened up enough
to receive the light?

38:04.443 --> 38:08.379
Except it won't be God...

38:08.447 --> 38:10.815
and, actually, it won't be light.

38:13.519 --> 38:16.020
(cane strikes, Sister Jude gasps)

38:16.088 --> 38:16.887
LEIGH:
Again!

38:21.660 --> 38:23.194
(Leigh groans)

38:27.866 --> 38:30.501
(gasps, groans weakly)

38:30.568 --> 38:32.870
("Carol of the Bells" continuing)

38:37.342 --> 38:38.775
This isn't going to work forever.

38:38.843 --> 38:40.744
Look at the dust--
it's a junk room.

38:40.812 --> 38:43.146
They practically never come in here.

38:43.214 --> 38:45.916
But you're right-- we'll have
to think of something.

38:45.984 --> 38:47.518
I'll finish.

38:47.586 --> 38:49.387
Get back to the infirmary
before they realize you're gone.

38:57.162 --> 38:59.230
One day, I'll bury you.
