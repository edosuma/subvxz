Marianne!
Marianne! Marianne! Marianne!

We wanted to rest

03:22.750 --> 03:24.750
I hate that sound.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.334
It's unknown.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.500
- Hello?
- Aha! I found you.

03:34.667 --> 03:37.037
Guess who it is.
Marianne, I know you're resting,

03:37.209 --> 03:39.579
but you have to be better.
When it happened to Adele,

03:39.750 --> 03:41.710
- she was yodelling again in three weeks.
- Harry.

03:41.792 --> 03:43.792
You think I didn't do my homework?
Listen.

03:43.959 --> 03:47.169
- I'm landing in Pantelleria in five minutes.
- Harry, listen, it's Paul.

03:47.334 --> 03:48.754
Meet me there and boy!

03:48.917 --> 03:51.143
- Do I have a surprise for you and Paul!
- We're at the lake. Harry.

03:51.167 --> 03:53.787
I've got to go.
I'm landing in five minutes.

03:56.959 --> 04:01.079
He's calling from the plane.
He said he's got a surprise for us.

05:17.375 --> 05:21.285
I don't want that
to be the last great thing I ever do.

05:21.459 --> 05:23.829
I mean,
maybe you're my swan song, love!

05:24.000 --> 05:26.670
Jesus, does he ever stop?

05:26.834 --> 05:28.834
My god.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.870
Hey!

05:33.042 --> 05:35.962
Is it you? Is it you? Yes!

05:36.125 --> 05:39.705
God!
I am so fucking happy to see you!

05:39.875 --> 05:42.185
Why didn't you let me know you were
here? You know I love this place.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.869
I'm in Rome all summer.
You can talk, can't you?

05:45.042 --> 05:47.712
Come on, tell me you're better.
Yes, you are. What?

05:47.875 --> 05:49.325
Ah, what? Not at all?

05:49.500 --> 05:51.710
Well, the doctor said two more weeks.

05:51.875 --> 05:55.915
It's the kid. Hey!
Come here, you old bucket.

05:56.084 --> 05:57.714
- You look fantastic!
- Oh, thanks.

05:57.875 --> 06:01.285
You look sexy, kind of metro-sexy.

06:02.709 --> 06:04.829
I'm sorry we didn't call,
but we're hiding out.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.420
What? Hiding out? Well, not from me.
Come on! Not any more, anyway!

06:08.584 --> 06:10.214
Come on,
when I'm finished with you,

06:10.375 --> 06:12.745
you'll be singing
those gravelly Gs again.

06:12.917 --> 06:16.537
Oh, Penny, Penny, come here!
Right, Pen, meet Marianne and Paul.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.329
- Hi!
- Oh, you brought a protégée.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.710
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm his daughter.

06:21.709 --> 06:24.289
- Excuse me?
- The looks on your faces!

06:24.459 --> 06:26.119
I'm sorry,
I should have warned you.

06:26.292 --> 06:28.962
Everyone's making
the same mistake. Pen, say hello.

06:29.125 --> 06:31.495
Hi! Yeah, he really loves it, though.

06:31.667 --> 06:35.497
She seems shy, but she is
a lovely bitch, like her mother.

06:35.667 --> 06:38.247
And underneath, she is
every inch my girl, aren't you?

06:38.417 --> 06:39.726
- Yeah.
- I think so. We're kind of..

06:39.750 --> 06:43.210
- Where are your wheels? Let's go.
- Uh, right in front.

06:43.375 --> 06:45.785
- So you didn't get a room?
- Is that going to be a problem?

06:45.959 --> 06:47.289
Yeah.
It's San Gaetano tomorrow.

06:47.459 --> 06:50.209
Ah! Shit. Yes.
No, 'cause last year they did it late

06:50.375 --> 06:52.518
because of the ferry strike.
Okay, anyway, doesn't matter.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.768
Oh, I know where we should go.
We can go squatting at Fabrizio's.

06:54.792 --> 06:57.172
He'll put us up.
But now, keep going, it's up here.

06:57.334 --> 07:00.624
There's a restaurant in the hills here
and, Pen, you're going to love it.

07:00.792 --> 07:05.292
It's amazing.
Fantastico! Pantelleria!

07:08.917 --> 07:12.077
Ta-da!

07:12.250 --> 07:14.250
You didn't know this was here?

07:14.417 --> 07:17.417
Don't tell me you've been eating
out of the fridge all this time.

07:19.584 --> 07:22.174
They only serve dinner
and only until September.

07:22.334 --> 07:24.334
Then it's fallow again until June.

07:36.375 --> 07:37.995
Harry, come on, that's a grave.

07:38.167 --> 07:41.457
Yeah, well,
Europe's a grave.

07:41.625 --> 07:44.665
Oh, ah, fuck.

07:49.834 --> 07:52.214
So when did this happen,
you and Harry?

07:52.375 --> 07:57.245
Last year. I finally put some pieces
together and figured it out.

07:57.417 --> 07:59.787
Mm. You're on your college break?

08:00.959 --> 08:02.959
On your Grand Tour?

08:03.959 --> 08:08.079
Yep. Normally I'd be spending the
summer in Connecticut with my mother,

08:08.250 --> 08:10.830
but she gets sick of me. Annie!

08:13.875 --> 08:16.865
She gets sick of me
and she just ships me off somewhere.

08:17.042 --> 08:20.502
This year, it was to Harry.

08:26.084 --> 08:29.254
So... you again?

08:29.417 --> 08:32.327
Happy? Say yes.

08:32.500 --> 08:35.169
- Yeah, I'm fine. How are you?
- Happy to see me?

08:36.708 --> 08:40.328
Oh, fuck. It's full.
Shall we tell them who you are?

08:40.500 --> 08:42.330
Oh, we don't do that anymore, Harry.

08:42.500 --> 08:45.250
Well, I think we may have to
'cause it's absolutely choccer.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.254
Good evening.

08:59.917 --> 09:01.077
Good evening.

09:01.250 --> 09:05.580
- A table for four.
- I'm booked, fully booked.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.790
Maybe tomorrow.

09:07.917 --> 09:09.497
- Marianne Lane. Do you know her?
- No.

09:09.625 --> 09:11.205
She's famous.

09:11.334 --> 09:13.124
- It's Marianne Lane!
- Who?

09:14.459 --> 09:16.619
It's Marianne Lane, that's her!

09:17.625 --> 09:18.705
The place is full.

09:18.834 --> 09:21.674
Rosario! Give him this table.

09:23.292 --> 09:25.792
Fine.
A table just freed up.

09:25.917 --> 09:27.957
Go take a seat.

09:28.334 --> 09:29.874
Thanks.

09:30.375 --> 09:33.825
Okay, guys, we're good I think.
Your name did it.

09:38.584 --> 09:40.124
Thanks!

09:40.250 --> 09:44.750
- Good evening.
- Thanks. Do you know Marianne Lane?

09:45.792 --> 09:47.792
- Harry!
- Hi.

09:47.959 --> 09:49.539
Unbelievable, my God!

09:49.667 --> 09:50.917
Good evening...

09:55.292 --> 09:56.462
Good evening, madam.

10:01.292 --> 10:04.462
It's Harry. Did you arrive from where?

10:04.625 --> 10:06.825
Oh, from Rome. Hello.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.420
Hello!

10:12.792 --> 10:14.872
- You look great!
- Thanks!

10:15.042 --> 10:19.672
Everyone, this is Harry!

10:22.042 --> 10:24.622
It's the same group
of people wherever you go.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.962
- So what are you going to have?
- No, she can't talk, all right?

10:28.125 --> 10:30.035
I would love a daiquiri.

10:30.209 --> 10:32.369
- Marianne!
- Have a daiquiri!

10:36.000 --> 10:39.170
Hotels are booked solid. There's meant
to be one room left at the Yacht Marina

10:39.334 --> 10:42.374
and Piero says there's a queen bed
we could use on the boat.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.726
At any rate, we got to get out
and enjoy the weather tomorrow,

10:44.750 --> 10:48.000
'cause the sirocco's on its way.
That's the warm wind from the Sahara

10:48.167 --> 10:49.577
I was telling you about.

10:49.750 --> 10:53.210
- With rain?
- No, it's dry, with sand.

10:54.209 --> 10:56.789
Marianne, Paul's headaches,
are they a problem here?

10:56.959 --> 10:59.329
Harry, stop this fucking shit,
all right? She can't talk.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.870
- I'm not going to repeat it!
- Of course she can talk.

11:02.042 --> 11:04.622
When Bjork had her operation,
after two weeks she was...

11:04.792 --> 11:08.422
I don't give a fuck what Bjork said,
all right? Or Adele.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.044
No. Nothing's a problem here.

11:10.209 --> 11:13.169
Nothing a few Nurofen
can't take care of.

11:15.584 --> 11:18.754
What is your name?

11:20.917 --> 11:22.997
What is your favourite colour?

11:24.875 --> 11:27.785
Seriously, you want me
to deck you? Fucking...

11:30.375 --> 11:33.035
What is your quest?

11:35.750 --> 11:38.370
To not end up like Julie Andrews.
Get it?

11:39.500 --> 11:41.620
Excuse me, four daiquiris.

11:41.750 --> 11:43.040
No, three...

11:43.167 --> 11:44.887
- Not for me.
- Oh, fuck, shit, yeah, sorry.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.167
What, what, what did she say?

11:52.334 --> 11:54.544
- She says her feet hurt.
- No!

11:54.709 --> 11:56.829
That's what she said.
She's getting a blister.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.210
If you've got something to say,
say it to me.

11:59.375 --> 12:00.575
She's asking you to stay.

12:00.750 --> 12:03.420
Oh, Christ, that took forever.

12:05.417 --> 12:06.997
- Is there a pool?
- Mm-hm.

12:21.792 --> 12:26.792
Ah. Yeah, this place isn't bad, eh?
Where are they?

12:26.959 --> 12:29.329
They're shooting
a commercial in Thailand.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.330
Uh-huh.

12:32.792 --> 12:34.792
Well, where am I?

12:34.959 --> 12:37.619
No, it's down at the property.
It's a little dammuso.

12:37.792 --> 12:39.622
It used to be a stable for the donkeys.

12:39.792 --> 12:42.962
Oh, far away.
Safe distance, eh?

12:45.542 --> 12:46.922
Mm-hm!

13:06.750 --> 13:08.750
You can't talk or won't?

13:11.917 --> 13:13.917
Cancer?

13:15.959 --> 13:18.329
Oh, right.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.500
Your career.

13:21.625 --> 13:23.455
Cool.

13:25.084 --> 13:27.084
I'm 22, you know.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.037
Cool.

13:48.834 --> 13:51.214
Fuck!

13:55.209 --> 13:59.619
Woo! Woo!

14:18.209 --> 14:20.579
Look! Woo!

14:22.667 --> 14:24.497
Fantastic!

14:30.334 --> 14:34.924
Aha, okay. What have we got here?
How are the pots and pans?

14:35.917 --> 14:41.077
Uh-huh.
What have we got in the frigo?

14:41.250 --> 14:45.370
Oh! Scandalo. Orribile.

14:45.542 --> 14:48.212
Terrible.
How are you guys living?

14:48.375 --> 14:51.205
What we have here?
Your mum... huh?

14:55.917 --> 14:59.077
It's cute.
You off to bed?

15:00.667 --> 15:03.207
Thank you. Mm.

15:03.375 --> 15:05.575
For having me to stay.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.330
All right. Here you go darling.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.332
Your pill.

15:12.334 --> 15:14.124
Good night.

15:21.167 --> 15:23.367
Good night.

15:23.542 --> 15:26.542
She's got tour dates
this winter, doesn't she?

15:26.709 --> 15:28.209
What's she planning to do?

15:28.375 --> 15:31.518
Well, she's kicked everything into the long
grass and it was the right thing to do.

15:31.542 --> 15:34.712
Jesus, man. It's hard to watch.
Is she like this when you fuck?

15:34.875 --> 15:36.665
I mean, how does it work?

15:36.834 --> 15:38.834
Does she write you a note
when she cums?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.920
Come here.

15:48.125 --> 15:50.325
You wish we were at a hotel.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.170
- I didn't say that.
- You forget, I know how you speak.

15:53.334 --> 15:55.124
- Oh yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

15:56.125 --> 15:57.705
Mm?

15:59.167 --> 16:01.367
I've been teaching myself
some Italian finally.

16:01.542 --> 16:04.122
Oh! 101 useful phrases?

16:04.292 --> 16:07.752
Well, no, I'm not reading Boccaccio
if that's what you mean.

16:07.917 --> 16:11.747
Vaffanculo. Go fuck yourself.
Go take it up the arse, in fact.

16:11.917 --> 16:14.287
Cacasentenze. Someone who pretends
to be very smart,

16:14.459 --> 16:16.669
who won't stop talking,
one who shits sentences.

16:16.834 --> 16:20.004
And my favourite is
vomitare I'anima.

16:20.167 --> 16:23.997
To puke your guts up.
Literally, to vomit your soul.

16:24.167 --> 16:25.537
Wow.

16:25.709 --> 16:29.539
I noticed you didn't drink
at dinner. Are you all right?

16:29.709 --> 16:31.749
I mean, does it bother you
that I'm drinking?

16:31.917 --> 16:33.917
Do you know what
vai a cagare means?

16:34.084 --> 16:35.674
Ah, yeah.

16:35.834 --> 16:38.584
You know, well, there,
you got it, just drop it, all right?

16:39.875 --> 16:42.245
Yeah, but are you all right?

16:42.417 --> 16:45.577
Hard part's over, yeah,
rehab and all that.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.497
Yeah.

16:48.667 --> 16:49.917
Good night.

16:50.084 --> 16:53.714
Good night!
Good night, good night!

17:16.584 --> 17:20.714
Phil,
you've got to be fucking kidding me.

17:20.875 --> 17:22.165
Are you happy?

17:22.334 --> 17:24.124
The head
of the label told me to my face

17:24.291 --> 17:27.672
that he considers those masters
"Done" with a capital fucking D.

17:27.834 --> 17:30.044
If he's going to change his mind now...

17:30.209 --> 17:33.169
You asked him to stay.
Why is that?

17:35.042 --> 17:37.042
You feeling nostalgic?

17:37.209 --> 17:39.329
Do you want to play that for me now?

17:39.500 --> 17:42.960
Don't let him know we can talk like this.

17:52.834 --> 17:55.504
You know we can't be naked
any more, right?

18:14.334 --> 18:17.964
Marianne! Over here my swan.

18:19.875 --> 18:23.325
Oh, there you are!

18:23.500 --> 18:25.710
What have you got there?

18:25.875 --> 18:28.455
Oh, I've been waiting for you.

18:28.625 --> 18:32.415
- Have you? I was looking for you.
- Sweetie. Mm.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.870
- Please, don't stop.
- Can I play your drum?

18:36.042 --> 18:38.042
- My drum?
- Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.790
We've got to leave at 11 o'clock.

18:51.959 --> 18:53.459
- No! Later.
- The car's coming.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.785
- Later. Later. Make it later.
- We can't move it.

18:55.959 --> 18:57.749
They won't be happy.
They will not be happy.

18:57.917 --> 19:01.497
- Make it later. I'll make it worth it.
- You will?

19:01.667 --> 19:02.667
Mm.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.670
What are you doing? Quit splashing.

19:21.834 --> 19:24.124
Look what a good job I'm doing, Clara!

19:24.834 --> 19:27.174
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

19:29.125 --> 19:31.325
Hey, more surprises, huh?

19:33.625 --> 19:36.285
Where'd you find this thundercat?
I can't get her off my elbow.

19:36.459 --> 19:37.829
What is thundercat?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.790
What is thundercat?
What is thundercat?

19:39.959 --> 19:42.789
- Nonna I'd like to fuck.
- Hey!

19:55.292 --> 19:58.792
Oh, yeah, you had nothing
and now you have everything you need.

19:58.959 --> 20:02.789
Zucchini for Paul and a little heaven
for everyone else.

20:02.959 --> 20:06.169
We're having for lunch orata al sale!

20:06.334 --> 20:08.924
How gross! Chilli, no!
Just herbs.

20:09.042 --> 20:12.712
Herbs only, yes. I'm your slave.

20:14.542 --> 20:16.422
Hey!

20:41.834 --> 20:45.124
"I grew up in a Britain where racism
was woven into the fabric of society

20:45.292 --> 20:47.792
"in a way that would be difficult
to imagine today.

20:47.959 --> 20:51.119
"I was of a generation that challenged it
politically and physically.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.872
"We confronted far-right thugs,
organised street patrols"

20:54.042 --> 20:57.502
"to protect black and Asian families
and stood up to police harassment."

20:57.667 --> 21:01.287
"Patriots wish us to be equally unthinking
in our attachment to the nation in every..."

21:03.584 --> 21:05.214
Oh.

21:08.459 --> 21:12.669
Ah. What the fuck's that?

21:12.834 --> 21:14.464
Is that a snake? Euch!

21:14.625 --> 21:16.455
No.
It's just another whip snake.

21:16.625 --> 21:20.075
Ew! Orribile! Get rid of it!

21:20.250 --> 21:22.080
We have them every day.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.960
Pen!

21:24.125 --> 21:26.665
- How's the room of the ass?
- A delight.

21:26.834 --> 21:29.334
How's the room of the monk?

21:36.000 --> 21:39.460
Oh, they made it! Great, great, great!
Fantastic!

21:39.625 --> 21:41.745
You'll love them. Salty and sweet.

21:41.917 --> 21:44.287
Oh, you're fine. It's hot
and they're communists

21:44.459 --> 21:48.249
and you're not speaking sweetheart,
so I had to make other plans.

21:48.417 --> 21:51.167
- Hey!
- Hey!

21:52.167 --> 21:54.577
Buongiorno!

21:54.750 --> 21:57.370
I want to go in that car
one day, sweetheart!

21:57.542 --> 22:00.502
- Tchuff!
- Tchuff!

22:00.667 --> 22:03.787
This is the house
that Jonas has bought.

22:03.959 --> 22:06.310
You can make a hell of a lot
more cash directing music videos

22:06.334 --> 22:08.124
than record producing, apparently.

22:08.292 --> 22:10.672
Oh, I shot a video with Jonas!

22:12.209 --> 22:14.579
Here she is. Here's the lady.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.620
Marianne, I'd like you to meet
some very old friends of mine.

22:17.792 --> 22:21.172
Mireille and Sylvie. Marianne Lane.

22:21.334 --> 22:23.714
She can't talk I'm afraid.
That's rock 'n' roll for you.

22:23.875 --> 22:26.165
It squeezes you like a lemon,
then it throws you out.

22:26.334 --> 22:30.834
Oh, but you're going to sing again!
This is not forever.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.120
- And this is Paul.
- Guess who I am.

22:34.292 --> 22:38.422
Oh, my dear. I know who you are.

22:41.417 --> 22:43.417
So lovely.

22:43.584 --> 22:47.834
You're daddy's little rascal
we've been hearing about.

23:10.834 --> 23:14.964
He told me once that he'd lost six grand's
worth of cocaine out in the parking lot.

23:15.125 --> 23:18.285
I mean, I've only seen that much
cocaine in my life maybe twice.

23:18.459 --> 23:21.499
When he told me. I nearly had
a fucking seizure in the green room.

23:21.667 --> 23:24.037
I... I couldn't let it go,
the thought of it lying out there

23:24.209 --> 23:28.039
under somebody's Dodge Caravan
or pick-up or whatever,

23:28.209 --> 23:30.789
so I got a dozen roadies to come out

23:30.959 --> 23:35.169
and shine their cell phones and torches
under the cars while he finished his set.

23:35.334 --> 23:38.624
I mean, this is a stadium, remember,
so thousands and thousands of cars

23:38.792 --> 23:40.622
and this group of roadies
going around going,

23:40.792 --> 23:42.962
- "Where is it? Is it here?"
- And they found it?

23:43.125 --> 23:45.495
No. They never found it.
Somebody else won that lotto.

23:45.667 --> 23:48.577
He told me later that he had planned
to kamikaze the whole lot that night

23:48.750 --> 23:50.580
and if he had,
then we would've found him

23:50.750 --> 23:54.620
covered in shit and fizz the next day
on the bathroom floor.

23:54.792 --> 23:59.832
Mm. But I think that losing that bag,
it saved his life... for a while.

24:01.417 --> 24:04.077
To be a genius is to be unruled.

24:04.250 --> 24:06.620
To be unruled is to be alone.

24:06.792 --> 24:09.462
Well, er, yeah...
for the first part maybe.

24:09.625 --> 24:13.365
- My sister has attempted suicide.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

24:13.542 --> 24:16.962
- Twice. Pills both times.
- Oh.

24:17.125 --> 24:19.705
It's the height of vanity, you know?

24:19.875 --> 24:23.995
You can't imagine her embarrassment
when she discovered that she lived.

24:24.167 --> 24:26.247
Yeah, well, you know,
no one should be ashamed.

24:26.417 --> 24:30.827
No. No. I tell her to call me
if she feels it coming over her again.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.500
Now, every time the phone rings
I resent her a little more

24:35.667 --> 24:38.747
- and I think that...
- Oh!

24:41.667 --> 24:43.667
Mind your feet.

24:43.834 --> 24:48.124
- You can't live forever.
- Exactly. None of us can.

24:48.292 --> 24:50.292
Oh, Marianne will.

24:51.292 --> 24:53.872
Ah, we've bored her.

24:54.042 --> 24:55.962
- Tchuff!

25:11.209 --> 25:13.419
No, well,
it was something unbelievable

25:13.584 --> 25:16.424
and that was when the Stones
came into their own, so to speak.

25:16.584 --> 25:20.714
They killed their fathers, so to speak,
in front of millions of people

25:20.875 --> 25:24.415
and the first real casualty
of that was Brian Jones.

25:24.584 --> 25:26.374
Wait a second, I'm sorry.

25:26.542 --> 25:29.122
Don't you think we should kill
the light in the booth?

25:29.292 --> 25:30.672
Yes, brilliant! Just right!

25:30.834 --> 25:33.084
- Good idea!
- All right. Make it black as you can.

25:33.250 --> 25:35.370
Paint it black.

25:35.542 --> 25:37.752
I'll buy you a beer for that.

25:37.917 --> 25:41.537
- Paul. Pleased to meet you. Hello. Hi.
- Harry. Pleased to meet you.

She's the woman of the century
and I'm talking about her soul now.

25:47.500 --> 25:50.580
Underneath all the shit, the shellac,
the noise, she's grounded.

25:50.750 --> 25:53.120
She's a fucking empath.
When the spaceships come in,

25:53.292 --> 25:55.872
she'll be right out in front
with her arms wide open,

25:56.042 --> 25:58.962
"Come, come to me, beautiful aliens!"

25:59.125 --> 26:01.785
You're an idiot, man, seriously.

26:02.792 --> 26:04.922
You should meet her.

26:05.084 --> 26:07.214
Why do you keep doing this?

26:07.375 --> 26:08.825
- We're done.
- No, you're not.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.040
- Your bed's not even cold. Come on!
- Paul, look at me. We're done.

26:15.625 --> 26:18.205
Marianne and I have
different music to make,

26:18.375 --> 26:20.575
different... different shit.

And on top of all of that, she's
a trumpets-of-Jericho, white-hot fuck.

26:27.584 --> 26:31.624
- I don't want to hear it.
- She fucks and she fucks and she fucks.

26:32.667 --> 26:34.497
Does she?

26:34.667 --> 26:37.327
- Yeah.

27:33.709 --> 27:35.499
- Are you happy Harry?
- Uh, nearly.

27:35.667 --> 27:38.327
I'm not crazy about the sound
I'm getting off the hi-hat.

27:38.500 --> 27:41.540
- Could we move the microphone?
- Can we fix it and then can we go?

27:41.709 --> 27:43.499
- Can we fucking go?
- I got it, Harry.

27:43.667 --> 27:45.287
Yeah.

- Hey, praise fuck, you made it. Yeah!
- Good to see you, man.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.080
Come here.
We're just to go for a take, Paul.

27:53.250 --> 27:55.250
- All right. Let's hear.
- Come, come, come.

27:55.417 --> 27:57.787
Uh, Marianne, Paul.
Paul, Marianne.

27:57.959 --> 28:00.169
Hello!

28:00.334 --> 28:02.624
Onward pagan soldiers.
Okay, let's go.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.920
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

28:26.250 --> 28:28.290
Ah! Who won?

28:28.459 --> 28:31.829
- Harry... maybe.
- Er, no, no, he won.

28:32.917 --> 28:35.577
Just about, just... just... Woo!

28:46.125 --> 28:47.705
Champion!

28:49.459 --> 28:51.249
See? I still got it.

29:08.084 --> 29:09.714
Oh!

29:09.875 --> 29:12.285
Sylvie! Ah!

29:17.125 --> 29:19.995
Three more boats have
sunk here coming from Tunisia.

29:20.167 --> 29:24.577
I want you to send down
Laurent and a photographer.

29:27.500 --> 29:30.960
Check this out.

29:38.625 --> 29:43.115
Why are we listening to this? You want
to end up in a padded room? Fuck.

29:43.292 --> 29:45.872
- It was on the turntable.
- I know, but it's shit!

29:46.042 --> 29:48.042
What have we got here?

29:48.209 --> 29:51.369
No, no, no, Roxy Music, no. Uh-oh!

29:51.542 --> 29:54.212
Some of this is good shit.

29:54.375 --> 29:58.915
Ah, ah, ah, ah! Look what they have!
Wait, where's Pen?

29:59.084 --> 30:02.334
Pen! Pen!

30:02.500 --> 30:05.460
Pen!

30:05.625 --> 30:09.495
Pen! Come hear what Daddy made!
Come on!

30:13.334 --> 30:17.874
Okay, I think Marianne's heard this.
Sylvie, do you know this album?

30:18.042 --> 30:21.212
I can tell you a little story about
my contribution to Rolling Stones history.

30:21.375 --> 30:24.205
Just after Darryl came in
and I was working with Don Smith,

30:24.375 --> 30:25.976
who'd done
a lot of Keith's solo stuff with me

30:26.000 --> 30:28.670
and we were at Windmill Lane in Dublin
and it was raining.

30:28.834 --> 30:30.594
Non-stop Irish rain,
it wouldn't fucking stop

30:30.625 --> 30:33.205
and I was quitting smoking,
so it was coffee, coffee, coffee

30:33.375 --> 30:35.205
and this song,
which you are going to hear,

30:35.375 --> 30:36.865
it just wasn't fucking working.

30:37.042 --> 30:39.042
Keith is insisting no drums, you know?

30:39.209 --> 30:41.729
We're working away and I think,
no, no, I go to Keith and I say,

30:41.875 --> 30:44.245
"Okay, so can Ronnie do
a track on pedal steel?"

30:44.417 --> 30:45.917
He goes, "Yeah, but no drums."

30:46.084 --> 30:49.084
So I'm thinking "What the fuck!"
So I give Mick castanets.

30:49.250 --> 30:50.970
So you've got Chuck Leavell
on the harmonium

30:51.042 --> 30:53.422
and everyone is folding in
all this beautiful shit,

30:53.584 --> 30:56.834
but this song is not taking off,
so I say to Keith, "Do you trust me?"

30:57.000 --> 31:00.620
He goes yeah. "If I promise no drums,
can we do a percussion track?"

31:00.792 --> 31:02.422
He says,
"What's Charlie going to play?"

31:02.584 --> 31:04.310
And I'm thinking,
"What is Charlie going to play?"

31:04.334 --> 31:07.334
But I'm asking myself what's
the sound, something, not too crisp

31:07.500 --> 31:10.670
and I look over
and I see in the corner...

31:10.834 --> 31:13.504
- Wait, what is it?
- What is it?

31:13.667 --> 31:16.617
Wait, listen, what is it?
It's not a drum.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.370
- What is it?
- Listen, listen!

31:26.542 --> 31:29.462
What's that? She knows.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.290
Listen!

31:33.459 --> 31:35.789
- It's a trash can.
- No!

31:35.959 --> 31:39.579
It's an aluminium fucking trash can.

31:39.750 --> 31:42.750
So I put Charlie out in the stairwell,
we put a mic three floors up

31:42.917 --> 31:45.060
and Keith's shaking his head
'cause he knows I'm right.

31:45.084 --> 31:47.964
As soon as Charlie starts
banging on it, we're off.

31:48.125 --> 31:51.205
A can for trash.

31:51.375 --> 31:53.745

32:05.625 --> 32:07.915
Aha! Okay, this is tops.

32:20.834 --> 32:24.464

- Christ, no. I was 16!

32:24.625 --> 32:27.575

34:39.583 --> 34:41.964
Did he not cook for you
when you were together?

34:42.125 --> 34:45.284
Marianne did, or it didn't happen.
Her mother was mad for cooking.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.619
It runs in her family.
Did you ever meet her finally, Paul?

34:48.792 --> 34:50.292
Yeah, last year in the hospital.

34:50.458 --> 34:53.918
Pen, she was a woman
to know. I loved everything about her.

34:54.083 --> 34:57.714
I can't believe that the clock can
just run out on a woman like that.

35:02.625 --> 35:04.995
Who is coming to the festival tonight?

35:05.167 --> 35:06.997
- What?
- San Gaetano!

35:07.167 --> 35:08.577
Well, I can't, I, uh...

35:08.750 --> 35:10.080
- Why?
- Why?

35:10.250 --> 35:15.040
It's one of the best nights
in the year! Everybody will be out.

35:15.209 --> 35:17.329
Music horrible! Dancing horrible!

35:17.500 --> 35:20.330
Food horrible! You can't stay away!

35:20.500 --> 35:23.960
- And the police band is playing.
- The police band? Fuck!

35:24.125 --> 35:26.495
Yes.
They're not so bad you know.

35:26.667 --> 35:28.167
At least come for the fireworks.

35:28.334 --> 35:31.504
Mais no, mais no!
There is no fireworks, cherie.

35:31.667 --> 35:33.643
I got to test some lenses
before the weather breaks.

35:33.667 --> 35:36.037
- Come for the no fireworks!
- Come!

35:36.209 --> 35:39.789
Will you come?
Paul's got to score lenses. You go free!

35:39.959 --> 35:42.709
We can lend you the Mehari,
so you can join us later.

35:42.875 --> 35:44.455
Oh, very kind of you!

35:50.542 --> 35:53.212
Hey, I just spoke to Robin.

35:53.375 --> 35:55.915
I'm on Kossakowski's shortlist
for his documentary.

35:56.084 --> 35:58.464
No!

35:58.625 --> 36:00.615
You want to choose a dress for me?

36:19.709 --> 36:21.709
It's a bit plain.

36:23.209 --> 36:25.329
Very charming.

37:00.084 --> 37:02.674
Now, promise me, no talking tonight.

37:09.584 --> 37:12.754
Some are
on the island now, hiding.

37:12.917 --> 37:15.117
Last year, one of the boats was spotted

37:15.292 --> 37:19.422
and the smugglers just threw
everybody overboard to try to flee,

37:19.584 --> 37:21.374
whilst the coastguards
did the rescues.

37:21.542 --> 37:26.042
But the goal, of course, is
France. A lot of them have family there.

37:26.209 --> 37:29.369
- There you go, Tunisia.
- Tunisia.

37:30.375 --> 37:32.745
Ah.
You can smell the jasmine from here.

37:34.375 --> 37:37.535
Oh, guys it has already started.

37:37.709 --> 37:39.329
Try to behave, my angel!

37:39.500 --> 37:41.080
Yes!

37:41.250 --> 37:44.420
I was talking to my daughter,
but you can be an angel, too.

37:44.584 --> 37:46.964
I'll be your angel.

38:06.584 --> 38:08.794
A drink without guilt.

38:10.875 --> 38:12.995
Now, frankly,
it's sentimental to think

38:13.167 --> 38:15.457
you can help Paul
by not drinking in front of him,

38:15.625 --> 38:18.785
or not talking about it for that matter.
Come on, it was a year ago.

38:18.959 --> 38:21.539
I mean, if he can't even hear
the subject mentioned,

38:21.709 --> 38:24.869
you don't have to go kicking over glasses
and it's just ridiculous.

38:25.042 --> 38:29.462
And people talk about addiction,
they talk about suicide. It happens.

38:29.625 --> 38:31.625
You know, I doubt
he wanted to kill himself anyway.

38:31.792 --> 38:34.962
If you ask me, he wanted
to kill the whole world, Marianne.

38:35.125 --> 38:36.575
Yeah, come on.

38:36.750 --> 38:39.920
I mean, we both know him.
It's misdirection.

38:40.084 --> 38:43.544
That's what they call it.
A case of psychic misdirection.

38:46.334 --> 38:48.334
Anyway, sorry.

38:49.875 --> 38:52.075
You both look great together.

38:52.250 --> 38:55.870
He takes very good care of you. No,
I mean it. He does. You look fantastic.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.042
You both look amazing.

38:59.875 --> 39:01.665
Wonderful, wonderful to see you.

39:01.834 --> 39:04.044
And you know,
this invalid thing, it suits you.

39:04.209 --> 39:06.419
Yeah, no it does,
'cause the roles are reversed

39:06.584 --> 39:08.714
and Paul can nurse you for a change.

39:09.709 --> 39:11.919
Oh, come on, I didn't mean it like that.

39:13.834 --> 39:16.214
Fuck. Okay! Okay!

39:16.375 --> 39:19.415
All right, all right, all right.
Nice dress, nice dress!

39:26.917 --> 39:31.667
Of course. Yeah.
I'll see you, yes?

39:35.375 --> 39:37.365
Bye, see you.

39:40.417 --> 39:42.997
You were my hero until just now.

39:43.167 --> 39:46.537
Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't stay away.
You all right?

39:46.709 --> 39:49.369
She was just boring
the life out of me is all.

39:49.542 --> 39:52.502
- You didn't look bored.
- Yes, I know. Thank you.

39:54.125 --> 39:58.705
My trouble is that I fall in love
with every pretty thing.

39:58.875 --> 40:00.865
That sounds paralysing.

40:03.292 --> 40:06.462
Try not to frighten the horses.
I always loved you saying that.

40:07.459 --> 40:11.619
It was always funny to me, 'cause you
always frightened the fucking horses.

40:11.792 --> 40:15.212
You, whereas with Paul...

40:19.625 --> 40:21.825
What's the point of Paul
in your life now?

40:23.584 --> 40:26.464
I was angry with you.
Yeah, I know I was slutting around,

40:26.625 --> 40:28.455
but you took everything so hard

40:28.625 --> 40:31.455
and now look what I've done.
I've...

40:31.625 --> 40:33.615
thrown you this square.

40:33.792 --> 40:38.082
Yeah, he's square, Marianne.
He's a square bear.

40:38.250 --> 40:43.120
He's all cuddly and built
for hibernating with and he stuck.

40:45.084 --> 40:50.374
I will always be
grateful to you for Paul.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.960
How are you dealing with this? Mm?

41:04.917 --> 41:06.917
What if it doesn't come back?

41:10.625 --> 41:13.785
You know, it might not come back.
Have you thought about that?

41:14.792 --> 41:17.462
It's your fucking life!

41:17.625 --> 41:19.825
Your voice is your fucking life!

41:24.000 --> 41:27.460
Bet that you'll just reinvent
yourself again, won't you?

41:27.625 --> 41:30.205
Is wearing your mother's clothes,
is that reinvention?

41:34.042 --> 41:36.712
I don't think so. Anyway, I suppose
you'll have your mummy phase

41:36.875 --> 41:38.865
and I have my daddy phase.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.460
But one way or another we're just going
to grow old together, aren't we?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
I'm happy, Harry.

41:55.334 --> 41:57.334
Can't you stand that?

42:09.625 --> 42:14.495
Would you think I was being ingratiating
if I said I wanted to make documentaries?

42:14.667 --> 42:18.787
Just pick up a camera and go film
the kids in Mansoura or something.

42:18.959 --> 42:20.959
Oh, have you been there?

42:22.042 --> 42:25.002
- I wouldn't let that stop me.
- Well, you want some advice?

42:25.167 --> 42:27.367
- Why? Because I'm a girl?
- No.

42:27.542 --> 42:31.672
No, you should definitely go to Mansoura,
or Detroit, whatever moves you.

42:31.834 --> 42:35.464
Just don't do it the Harry way.
Just lay low, keep your mouth shut.

42:35.625 --> 42:38.365
You know, don't take a camera.
Go empty-handed, seriously.

42:38.542 --> 42:42.172
You'll humiliate yourself any other way,
trust me. I know everything about it.

42:44.667 --> 42:46.867
All right. I'm not afraid of that.

42:52.250 --> 42:54.040
Do you want some?

42:54.209 --> 42:56.869
- No. I don't smoke.
- Doesn't mean you don't want some.

42:57.042 --> 42:59.422
Yes, it does.

43:04.667 --> 43:08.867
You must have been really desperate
to crash your car like that.

43:09.042 --> 43:10.622
Excuse me?

43:10.792 --> 43:13.462
He said you were shot out of it,
really far...

43:14.917 --> 43:17.787
and you didn't leave a note or anything.

43:18.792 --> 43:20.832
That's what he said?

43:24.250 --> 43:27.870
He thinks it's the most
interesting thing you've done.

43:28.042 --> 43:31.212
He thinks you're too conceited
to stand being addicted to anything.

43:31.375 --> 43:33.455
I'm guessing he's talking about drinking.

43:39.667 --> 43:41.667
Are you waiting for
a reaction or something?

43:44.167 --> 43:45.327
Don't waste your time.

43:45.500 --> 43:48.170
And now let's play Piñata!

43:55.000 --> 43:58.790
Go right, go right...

43:58.917 --> 44:00.707
Go!

44:04.834 --> 44:06.924
Well done, Francesco!
Well done!

44:10.459 --> 44:12.039
And next up is...

44:12.167 --> 44:14.037
Good evening!

44:14.167 --> 44:16.247
- Thanks for the table.
- You're welcome!

44:16.375 --> 44:19.825
That's the guy who gave us the table.
Come on! Let's perch over here.

44:27.875 --> 44:29.865
When did we last do this?

44:30.042 --> 44:32.042
How many years ago?

44:32.209 --> 44:34.209
When we were innocent babes.

45:24.167 --> 45:26.367
Come on! Come on!

45:28.792 --> 45:30.962
Oh, fuck, there's nobody here.

45:31.084 --> 45:32.584
Good evening.

45:32.709 --> 45:34.499
We don't have available tables.

45:34.625 --> 45:37.915
- What do you have?
- Karaoke.

45:38.042 --> 45:39.582
Karaoke?!

45:40.709 --> 45:44.119
Oh, no, he says the screen is broken.
Oh, fuck.

45:44.292 --> 45:47.672
Can I have a glass of sparkling water?

45:49.000 --> 45:52.170
Find something we'd be
embarrassed to sing anywhere else.

45:55.750 --> 45:58.120
Come.

45:58.292 --> 46:00.962

- Oh!
- Good night, girls.

50:01.834 --> 50:05.004
Mireille! Good night.

50:27.125 --> 50:30.575
I told you I was going
to drive the car. Now I'm going to.

50:30.750 --> 50:33.920
I'll keep my hand on the stick shift!

50:57.417 --> 50:59.417
Mm. Was it Mireille?

50:59.584 --> 51:01.714
Yeah.

51:01.875 --> 51:04.075
Hold on, give it to me. Let me...

51:06.209 --> 51:08.789
Mm. By the way, what's...

51:08.959 --> 51:11.539
Remember that woman he was with?
Um...

51:11.709 --> 51:14.869
She was teaching at NYU.
What's her name again?

51:15.042 --> 51:16.502
Yeah, Christie.

51:16.667 --> 51:18.457
They were swinging right?

51:18.625 --> 51:20.995
- What did you say? Dusty Christie?
- Busty Christie.

51:21.167 --> 51:25.117
Yeah, she had huge melons!

51:25.292 --> 51:28.122
You remember?
You remember they were swinging, right?

51:28.292 --> 51:32.122
Yeah. Now, what was it?
Groups, men, college...

51:32.292 --> 51:34.872
Boys, college girls.

51:35.042 --> 51:37.712
What?
He'd fuck everything.

51:37.875 --> 51:40.535
That's what I'm saying.

51:40.709 --> 51:42.499
Well,
if you're talking about Penelope,

51:42.667 --> 51:45.247
I'll tell you that
whatever's going on there,

51:45.417 --> 51:47.997
it's mutual and it's a great couple.

51:48.167 --> 51:50.207
Come on, look at them.

51:52.042 --> 51:54.252
Really! Come on.

51:59.084 --> 52:00.424
Mm-hm.

52:00.584 --> 52:02.624
Mm-hm.

52:04.917 --> 52:07.577
So, that makes all of us.

52:11.500 --> 52:15.330
He must just not know
how it looks with Penelope.

52:15.500 --> 52:17.500
I think I should say something.

52:17.667 --> 52:20.327
Trust me.
She can handle herself just fine.

52:32.042 --> 52:34.712
Which one of these do you prefer?

52:44.625 --> 52:46.415
Me, too.

52:55.709 --> 52:58.079
Well, that woman drives
like a lunatic. You know that.

52:58.250 --> 53:01.000
But I was driving
and she, she distracted me.

53:01.167 --> 53:02.997
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

53:03.167 --> 53:05.917
Listen, I think if it's both of us,
then we can push it together.

53:06.084 --> 53:07.764
You need a tow truck.
That's what you need.

53:07.834 --> 53:09.834
- Oh, Christ. Will you come or not?
- A tow truck.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.170
They both tell me yes,
but I don't think he really is.

53:25.917 --> 53:30.997
I mean, we don't even really look,
or act very much alike at all.

53:34.625 --> 53:36.745
I'm going to ask him to take the test.

53:38.084 --> 53:40.124
There are reasons I'd like to know.

53:41.459 --> 53:43.289
Private reasons.

53:54.292 --> 53:57.752
- What the fuck happened?
- I was going and coming at the same time.

53:57.917 --> 54:00.497
- Where's Mireille?
- She went home to wash her mouth.

54:02.625 --> 54:04.665
How the hell
do you want us to move that?

54:04.834 --> 54:06.834
Oh, well, let's hope
it won't roll forward.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.460
I think, if we release the handbrake,
we can put it back on to the road.

54:14.584 --> 54:16.504
All right, let's push it.

54:16.667 --> 54:18.457
- Careful.
- Yeah.

54:19.667 --> 54:21.577
One, two, three.

54:21.750 --> 54:24.080
All right.

54:25.917 --> 54:27.707
Okay and again.

54:27.875 --> 54:29.495
All right, yeah, let's go.

54:29.667 --> 54:31.457
One, two, three.

54:36.292 --> 54:38.672
Fuck!

54:38.834 --> 54:41.214
This is not going to work.
Forget about it.

54:41.375 --> 54:43.415
Jesus Christ!

54:43.584 --> 54:47.424
Too hot for white people. Fuck!

54:49.459 --> 54:51.829
You're pretty domesticated
for a rock star.

54:55.250 --> 54:58.420
You were with Harry
for what, six years?

55:00.417 --> 55:02.417
And you've been
with Paul for how long?

55:07.917 --> 55:10.417
Cool.

55:11.709 --> 55:15.829
I heard that there used to be six songs
on either side of a record album.

55:17.875 --> 55:21.245
You'd hear six and then you'd have
to flip the thing over to hear more.

55:36.667 --> 55:38.667
You know what?

55:38.834 --> 55:42.964
I bet they put one really good song
on each side,

55:43.125 --> 55:45.785
so you just keep flipping it over.

55:47.667 --> 55:49.457
By the way, have you seen my iPod?

55:49.625 --> 55:52.785
Because that sneaky Harry is
always trying to get into it

55:52.959 --> 55:54.959
to see what I've been listening to.

55:58.459 --> 56:00.369
So you're working again.

56:00.542 --> 56:02.752
- Yeah, I'm shooting for hire nowadays.
- Yeah?

56:02.917 --> 56:05.287
For a Russian master,
Kossakovsky. You know him?

56:05.459 --> 56:07.459
- No.
- Six-country shoot.

56:07.625 --> 56:10.285
- Uh-huh.
- It keeps me busy for a while.

56:11.459 --> 56:13.079
When are you finishing yours?

56:13.250 --> 56:15.830
- Oh, you remember that?
- Yeah of course.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.870
Lost Dog, American Journalism
in the 21st Century.

56:19.042 --> 56:21.172
You showed me
that amazing Cronkite interview.

56:21.334 --> 56:23.174
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what?

56:23.334 --> 56:26.084
You're not giving that up too,
are you?

56:27.084 --> 56:31.124
You shot all that footage. What is it,
just lying in a drawer somewhere?

56:31.292 --> 56:35.422
No, actually it's in a closet.
Five hard drives, but that can wait.

56:37.334 --> 56:40.334
Yeah, well,
adjust your goals, not the world.

56:41.584 --> 56:43.794
Is that the same advice you'd give Pen?

56:43.959 --> 56:47.829
No! She's young. She should change
the world any chance she gets.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.870
I think the women should change things
now anyway. We've had our chance.

56:53.750 --> 56:56.120
Anyway,
you will find your way back to it.

56:56.292 --> 56:59.042
You just got to get your finance,
good editor, some guts.

56:59.209 --> 57:01.249
Just shut the fuck up, all right?

57:02.417 --> 57:05.577
Just stop talking and we'll be fine.
Can you do that?

57:08.667 --> 57:10.667
Thanks a lot.

57:12.875 --> 57:14.705
I thought it was a good observation.

57:14.875 --> 57:17.245
It's the way you give it.
It's not very careful.

57:17.417 --> 57:19.537
Well, it's how I care, isn't it?

57:19.709 --> 57:22.079
Honesty is the greatest fidelity.

57:22.250 --> 57:26.080
Yeah, well, the world is not
ready for your honesty.

57:27.125 --> 57:29.115
I don't believe in half truths.

57:29.292 --> 57:31.292
Oh, you used to.

57:31.459 --> 57:33.669
Yeah, well,
I learned my lesson then, didn't I?

57:33.834 --> 57:36.424
Not in time, but I learned it.

57:36.584 --> 57:40.714
I think going bust with Marianne was the
great dumb tragedy of my great dumb life.

57:42.125 --> 57:44.115
It feels good to say it to you.

57:45.917 --> 57:47.957
You learned your lesson in time,
though, didn't you?

57:48.084 --> 57:50.084
I mean, that's the important thing.

57:52.250 --> 57:54.620
Thank god for emergency rooms, eh?

58:00.292 --> 58:03.752
Hey! How did my beauties sleep?

58:03.917 --> 58:07.957
- My adorable ones!
- Did you get the car out?

58:08.125 --> 58:12.535
No, we couldn't move it.
We need Clara to tell us what to do I think.

58:12.709 --> 58:15.289
Whoa! Oh!

58:52.084 --> 58:55.254
Can I borrow the wheels?
I want to see people.

58:55.417 --> 58:58.037
Pen, you want to come?

58:58.209 --> 59:01.369
What? Groceries?
Okay, we'll go together.

01:00:03.542 --> 01:00:06.122
I need more treasure.
Throw your watch in.

01:00:06.292 --> 01:00:09.122
- I'm reading.
- Well, I need a shipwreck.

01:00:09.292 --> 01:00:10.712
Throw in a chair.

01:00:10.875 --> 01:00:12.915
I'm not going to throw in a chair.
I'm sorry.

01:00:17.459 --> 01:00:20.959
Mister Paul! I'm finished.
I'm going to the village.

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:23.004
Okay, Clara.

01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:27.920
Shouldn't you be going
round the island?

01:00:28.084 --> 01:00:30.754
Go check it out.
It's pretty beautiful out here.

01:00:32.167 --> 01:00:33.787
I wouldn't know where to go.

01:00:33.959 --> 01:00:36.169
There's a lake pretty close by.

01:00:36.334 --> 01:00:38.924
A lot of kids come out,
bring guitars, play music.

01:00:39.084 --> 01:00:40.714
It's fun. You should check it out.

01:00:45.417 --> 01:00:47.417
Show me.

01:00:47.584 --> 01:00:52.424
It's half day, market day
and this wind is not sirocco!

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:55.920
Fast first and then slow,
one doesn't understand what it wants.

01:00:56.042 --> 01:01:00.002
It's weird... go while it isn't there.

01:01:01.417 --> 01:01:04.077
It's two miles from here.
It's not so far.

01:01:04.209 --> 01:01:06.789
- Walking?
- Yeah, it's a proper hike.

01:01:06.959 --> 01:01:09.329
You should be up for it.

01:01:14.792 --> 01:01:16.792
Okay.

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:26.040
You want to see me do a handstand?

01:01:26.209 --> 01:01:28.419
Yeah, go ahead.

01:01:43.834 --> 01:01:46.674
The Allies bombed
the hell out of this island.

01:01:48.959 --> 01:01:51.829
Maybe the market's up here, no?
I think it is.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Bit of a beaten up old town.

01:01:56.167 --> 01:01:58.747
I think it's down here. Yeah.

01:02:02.375 --> 01:02:07.245
It can look
a bit full-on, a bit, you know, it could...

01:02:07.417 --> 01:02:10.867
In a situation like last night,
it could be misconstrued.

01:02:11.042 --> 01:02:13.252
What do you mean?
What do you mean, Marianne?

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:21.330
What shit!
I'm too brash. I'm too impulsive.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.500
I'm too a lot of things,
but Christ, I'm sound.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:28.670
I mean, look, if you asked me,
do I find my daughter sexy?

01:02:28.834 --> 01:02:31.424
Have I caught myself
enjoying the sight of her?

01:02:31.584 --> 01:02:33.544
Yeah, I have.

01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:36.869
I didn't know her until a year ago,
so yeah, it's a little odd.

01:02:43.834 --> 01:02:47.294
I acknowledge and I deal with
the shit that goes on in my head.

01:02:53.042 --> 01:02:55.252
Coming from Paul,
this would be outrageous.

01:02:55.417 --> 01:02:57.997
Paul is Paul,
but coming from you, it's...

01:02:59.084 --> 01:03:02.544
I mean, what is the impulse here?
To humiliate me or...

01:03:02.709 --> 01:03:05.289
What is it, really?

01:03:05.459 --> 01:03:09.289
Harry! This is not about us!

01:03:09.459 --> 01:03:12.919
Isn't it? We've been testing each other
ever since I got off the plane.

01:03:13.084 --> 01:03:18.374
Well, I've never stopped, but...
I mean, come on, it's me!

01:03:18.542 --> 01:03:20.542
Stop this lying to yourself.

01:03:21.709 --> 01:03:23.709
Listen!

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:27.920
I am not going
to leave Paul for you!

01:03:28.084 --> 01:03:30.084
Oh, what? You don't...

01:03:31.667 --> 01:03:33.867
What, you thought
I was here for the capers?

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:42.710
They used to process slaves
on this island. Did you know that?

01:03:43.709 --> 01:03:46.369
I hate this fucking island.

01:03:48.042 --> 01:03:51.212
Look, let's not get things confused!

01:03:51.375 --> 01:03:53.365
I'm not fucking my daughter!

01:03:55.084 --> 01:03:57.084
Oh!

01:03:57.250 --> 01:04:00.870
So fucking predictable!
Big enough audience?

01:04:01.042 --> 01:04:03.422
Are you kidding?

01:04:03.584 --> 01:04:07.044
We...
We just made their vacation.

01:04:07.209 --> 01:04:09.039
Haven't we?

01:07:02.167 --> 01:07:04.167
I did leave a note.

01:07:07.625 --> 01:07:10.665
But anyway we tore it apart
when I, uh...

01:07:11.875 --> 01:07:13.995
when I got out of the hospital.

01:07:15.417 --> 01:07:17.617
You and Marianne?

01:07:17.792 --> 01:07:19.622
Yeah.

01:07:23.584 --> 01:07:25.794
What did it say?

01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:27.749
Uh, just her name.

01:07:29.167 --> 01:07:31.827
I wanted to write it down one last time.

01:09:17.375 --> 01:09:19.365
I want you to see this!

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:32.580
Giuseppe?

01:09:33.584 --> 01:09:35.794
Si.

01:09:35.959 --> 01:09:37.959
Good morning.

01:09:38.917 --> 01:09:41.707
- She's my friend, Marianne.
- Come in.

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:48.460
- Morning, Rosa.
- Hello, how are you?

01:09:48.959 --> 01:09:50.999
My friend, Marianne.

01:09:51.125 --> 01:09:53.495
- Do you recognise her?
- Yes.

01:09:54.209 --> 01:09:56.459
Please show us how you make ricotta.

01:09:57.125 --> 01:10:01.705
Civil Protection volunteers are ready
to assist arriving migrants.

01:10:01.834 --> 01:10:04.424
First reception procedures
have commenced...

01:10:04.542 --> 01:10:05.752
Come here.

01:10:08.584 --> 01:10:10.794
The ricotta will be coming up.

01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:15.540
Coming up, coming up.

01:10:17.459 --> 01:10:22.959
Within a few hours,
a reception centre was set up.

01:10:23.084 --> 01:10:26.674
At 11:00 PM
the fishing boat docks at the port.

01:10:26.792 --> 01:10:29.712
The migrants wave
and thank rescue workers,

01:10:29.834 --> 01:10:32.214
thankful they've arrived safely.

01:10:32.334 --> 01:10:35.924
Even the children,
held by their parents, wave hello.

01:10:36.042 --> 01:10:38.872
People who were desperate
in their homeland...

01:10:39.042 --> 01:10:43.002
- Come and see the ricotta.
- Taste it while it's warm.

01:10:44.084 --> 01:10:47.584
Marked by horrors of war,
they hope for a better future...

01:10:51.625 --> 01:10:53.365
Medical exams confirm

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:56.330
that only a few migrants
need to be hospitalised...

01:10:56.959 --> 01:10:59.039
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.580
Mm.

01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:08.120
- Good?
- Very good!

01:11:08.292 --> 01:11:10.872
Okay.

01:11:12.125 --> 01:11:13.245
Mm.

01:11:55.959 --> 01:11:57.959
Okay?

01:12:02.792 --> 01:12:04.792
No, you...

01:12:04.959 --> 01:12:07.829
You don't need to apologise... ever.

01:12:09.167 --> 01:12:11.167
You never have.

01:13:48.875 --> 01:13:50.455
Well,
they got to be here somewhere.

01:13:50.625 --> 01:13:53.285
They must've gone off
for a hike or something.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
You do the ricotta?

01:14:05.959 --> 01:14:08.619
Here, be careful.

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:10.622
Do it like this.

01:14:10.792 --> 01:14:14.622
Turn it around... like that.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Come on.

01:15:17.167 --> 01:15:20.077
This is you. It's in you.
Let it out for me. Come on.

01:15:23.375 --> 01:15:26.035
Come on, this is happening.
It's happening.

01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:29.169
Darling, no.

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.460
He put a bell on your neck, right?

01:15:36.459 --> 01:15:38.459
I'm glad he did.

01:15:43.167 --> 01:15:46.327
- I can love you now.
- No.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.500
Don't be angry.

01:15:50.167 --> 01:15:52.167
I love you.

01:16:01.209 --> 01:16:03.869
Then we shouldn't see
each other anymore.

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:31.502
In sixth grade,
they offered an opera class at my school

01:16:31.667 --> 01:16:33.667
and I was hooked.

01:16:33.834 --> 01:16:37.674
La Momma Morta.
"I'm love. I'm love."

01:16:37.834 --> 01:16:40.214
I had to conquer
all things Italian after that.

01:16:40.375 --> 01:16:43.245
Ah. We were going to start without you.

01:16:43.417 --> 01:16:45.417
I'm sorry. We got kind of lost.

01:16:45.584 --> 01:16:47.374
Uh-huh.

01:16:51.792 --> 01:16:53.582
Parmigiano please, Pen.

01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:00.537
Thanks.

01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:03.499
So you two must be starving.
You went swimming as well, no?

01:17:04.667 --> 01:17:07.327
- We did.
- Where? At the lake?

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:10.790
Um, no, actually, uh,
Paul took us to the cliffs.

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:12.579
Oh.

01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:16.250
We dived and dived and dived.

01:17:16.417 --> 01:17:17.707
How was the wind?

01:17:17.875 --> 01:17:21.825
I'll need a spoon to scrape the sand
out of my eyes, that's for sure.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.500
Mm-hm.

01:17:26.834 --> 01:17:30.834
Well, you got your beach, then,
more or less.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.580
It was better than a beach.

01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:35.620
Actually,
there are a couple of beaches here,

01:17:35.792 --> 01:17:39.252
like micro beaches or something.
I don't know what they call them.

01:17:39.417 --> 01:17:42.417
But really tiny, just for three
or four people. It's beautiful.

01:17:42.584 --> 01:17:45.174
You can do anything
you like out there really.

01:17:45.334 --> 01:17:47.924
If the wind dies down,
that's what we do next.

01:17:48.084 --> 01:17:49.874
You'd love it.

01:17:53.667 --> 01:17:56.827
By the way, did Marianne make this?

01:17:58.167 --> 01:18:00.827
- Yeah.
- This is so good, I can tell.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.670
Cilantro. That's her signature.
She'll put it in anything.

01:18:07.292 --> 01:18:09.422
What? Will she?

01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:11.424
Yeah.

01:18:12.542 --> 01:18:16.672
By the way, they always say in
Pantelleria, people eat a lot of capers,

01:18:16.834 --> 01:18:20.004
but so far we haven't eaten any, right?

01:18:21.209 --> 01:18:22.789
Oh, I have.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.830
Fucking gecko, shit!

01:18:40.167 --> 01:18:43.617
I think I'm going to go watch
a movie or something.

01:18:45.625 --> 01:18:48.205
- Are you good?
- Yeah, are you?

01:18:48.375 --> 01:18:51.365
Yeah, I'm just beat from the day.

01:18:52.959 --> 01:18:54.959
Pretty beat.

01:18:55.125 --> 01:18:56.705
Okay.

01:18:58.459 --> 01:19:00.289
Good night, Pen.

01:19:00.459 --> 01:19:02.459
Good night.

01:19:11.709 --> 01:19:13.539
I hope she didn't catch cold.

01:19:14.542 --> 01:19:17.122
She's just tired. It was a long day.

01:19:18.125 --> 01:19:19.955
Mm.

01:19:25.417 --> 01:19:27.417
Swimming...

01:19:28.834 --> 01:19:30.674
Swimming can take it out of you.

01:19:35.542 --> 01:19:38.922
How was your day? Any good?

01:19:45.209 --> 01:19:48.829
Pen? It's Harry.

01:19:50.792 --> 01:19:52.582
Come in.

01:19:55.542 --> 01:19:57.372
Sorry, um, it's just...

01:19:57.542 --> 01:20:01.962
You asked me to tell you when
I was ready to go back and I'm ready.

01:20:02.125 --> 01:20:03.575
Okay.

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:05.750
I've had my vacation.

01:20:09.125 --> 01:20:10.785
Did what you wanted to do?

01:20:10.959 --> 01:20:12.959
It was fantastic.

01:20:13.959 --> 01:20:16.329
I'll remember it always.

01:20:20.334 --> 01:20:24.924
Yeah, well, maybe go tomorrow.
Good night.

01:20:25.084 --> 01:20:27.084
Night-night.

01:21:17.459 --> 01:21:19.459
I got your pills.

01:21:34.042 --> 01:21:36.172
I'm done with him. Aren't you?

01:22:33.792 --> 01:22:35.922
All the little snakes are sleeping.

01:22:56.042 --> 01:22:58.042
Mm.

01:23:50.667 --> 01:23:53.037
Oh, fuck!

01:23:53.209 --> 01:23:56.669
Are you waiting for me?

01:23:56.834 --> 01:23:58.004
Sh.

01:23:58.167 --> 01:24:00.537
That's a nice surprise.

01:24:04.875 --> 01:24:07.245
If you have something
to say to me, say it.

01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:10.417
- Keep your voice down.
- What, you think I'm plastered?

01:24:10.584 --> 01:24:12.964
Tonight's not the night for it.

01:24:13.125 --> 01:24:15.615
No, tonight is definitely
the night for it.

01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:23.289
Paul, fuck! Seems you agree, eh?

01:24:25.375 --> 01:24:29.205
Why don't you do me a favour?
Go to bed.

01:24:29.375 --> 01:24:32.825
Harry, listen. We need to talk.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
No, I need to pack.
I need to wake Pen up.

01:24:35.167 --> 01:24:37.077
I need to be out of here by dawn.

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:39.920
I don't particularly want
to see you in the light of day.

01:24:40.084 --> 01:24:41.834
Yeah.

01:24:44.209 --> 01:24:49.169
I'll take a cab for the morning, so, uh,
thanks for the use of your car, sir.

01:24:53.959 --> 01:24:56.079
Oh. Are we fighting?

01:24:57.084 --> 01:24:58.674
I'm sorry.

01:24:58.834 --> 01:25:01.214
- You're too much. Fuck.
- Harry, come on.

01:25:01.375 --> 01:25:04.325
Why don't you go wake
my daughter up, eh?

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:09.000
You can tell her to pack and we'll
get the fuck out of here right now.

01:25:17.292 --> 01:25:19.042
Did you fuck her or not?

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:25.000
- Did you fuck her or not?
- Did you fuck Marianne?

01:25:25.167 --> 01:25:27.747
It's not the same, man.

01:25:29.417 --> 01:25:31.935
- You know what the problem is?
- You know what the problem is...

01:25:31.959 --> 01:25:36.169
is I gave you too much credit.
We were friends.

01:25:36.334 --> 01:25:37.794
Better than brothers.

01:25:37.959 --> 01:25:41.789
Better than all those shits in their lofts
talking about who the fuck cares what.

01:25:41.959 --> 01:25:46.079
And now you just...
you just tolerate me.

01:25:47.084 --> 01:25:50.084
Do you know
how offensive that is to me?

01:25:50.250 --> 01:25:54.290
Think what you want, judge the hell out
of me, but don't fucking tolerate me.

01:25:57.959 --> 01:26:00.539
- You don't deserve either of them.
- Neither do you.

01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:04.829
You have no idea of the shit
that I got her out of... off of.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.580
Well, I got her off you.

01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:09.920
What? I gave her to you.

01:26:15.834 --> 01:26:17.464
You're obscene.

01:26:17.625 --> 01:26:19.575
We're all obscene.

01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:23.370
Everyone's obscene.
That's the whole fucking point.

01:26:23.542 --> 01:26:25.922
We see it
and we love each other anyway.

01:26:26.084 --> 01:26:29.374
Love? I was wondering how long
it would take you to pull that...

01:26:36.542 --> 01:26:38.172
You hit me.

01:26:38.334 --> 01:26:39.754
You hit me!

01:26:46.959 --> 01:26:48.959
All right, Paul.

01:26:49.959 --> 01:26:52.539
I don't know what I'm doing either.

01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:54.119
Here, help me out, will you?

01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:56.292
Yeah, come on, I'm sorr... Oh!

01:26:58.959 --> 01:27:00.789
What is this?

01:27:04.625 --> 01:27:06.415
Let go!

01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:26.750
Ah! Argh!

01:28:27.584 --> 01:28:29.584
Come on!

01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:32.620
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me!

01:28:34.917 --> 01:28:38.077
Harry, come on, come on, come on!

01:32:23.917 --> 01:32:27.167
Madam, madam...

01:32:27.959 --> 01:32:30.619
Mr Harry in the pool.

01:32:38.209 --> 01:32:41.459
Dead. Dead!

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.420
Ah! No! Argh!

01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:54.120
Don't scream!

01:32:56.250 --> 01:33:00.500
Your voice, madam,
you'll ruin your voice!

01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:05.420
Don't scream!

Hello, sir.

01:34:47.459 --> 01:34:50.329
What is that? Do you know?
That thing...

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.830
It's... It's an album.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.210
Emotional Rescue
by the Rolling Stones.

01:34:58.042 --> 01:35:01.582
- What'd he say?
- I didn't hear.

01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:03.120
It's music.

01:35:03.250 --> 01:35:05.170
Oh... vinyl?

01:35:17.542 --> 01:35:19.002
May I?

01:35:21.625 --> 01:35:24.035
Can I have some water please?

01:36:01.959 --> 01:36:03.789
There you go, sir.

01:36:03.959 --> 01:36:05.579
Are you OK, madam?

01:36:26.125 --> 01:36:27.245
So, Clara...

01:36:28.334 --> 01:36:35.254
first I need to know at what time
Mr. Hawkes went swimming in the pool.

01:36:38.042 --> 01:36:40.792
What time Mr Harry...

01:36:42.625 --> 01:36:45.285
in the water?

01:36:46.459 --> 01:36:49.709
The bath. Splash, in the water.

01:36:49.875 --> 01:36:52.535
Well, he went out after dinner,
around ten o'clock

01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:54.869
and we were asleep
before he came back, so...

01:36:55.042 --> 01:36:56.372
Around 10:00.

01:36:56.542 --> 01:36:58.462
- No, no.
- No, no, no!

01:36:58.625 --> 01:37:01.285
No dieci. After dieci.

01:37:01.459 --> 01:37:04.669
- After 10:00.
- After 10:00... I see.

01:37:04.834 --> 01:37:08.254
And them?
When did they go to sleep?

01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:11.250
Ask them.

01:37:11.875 --> 01:37:15.865
What time, uh, you...

01:37:17.584 --> 01:37:19.504
In the bed.

01:37:25.417 --> 01:37:27.667
12:00. And...?

01:37:28.834 --> 01:37:29.834
You too?

01:37:29.959 --> 01:37:31.669
And the gentleman?

01:37:31.792 --> 01:37:33.422
Um, around 1:30.

01:37:34.417 --> 01:37:36.287
And then I took a sleeping pill.

01:37:38.584 --> 01:37:40.754
- He took drugs.
- You took drugs?!

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:45.250
Drugs? No, of course not. It...

01:37:45.417 --> 01:37:48.077
Jesus, it's a medicine,
all right, to go to sleep.

01:37:48.250 --> 01:37:49.080
Ah!

01:37:49.209 --> 01:37:51.709
- Pills to sleep.
- To sleep, OK.

01:37:51.834 --> 01:37:56.714
Listen, I'm wasting too much time!
I have 30 people to question.

01:37:56.834 --> 01:37:58.834
What can we do?
It's not their fault, poor things.

01:37:58.959 --> 01:38:03.579
Tell them to come
to the police station at 2:00.

01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:05.829
And I will find a suitable translator.

01:38:05.959 --> 01:38:10.459
Oh! He says, uh,
station carabinieri, two!

01:38:10.584 --> 01:38:14.214
At 2:00. All three of them.

01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:17.080
And wear shoes!

01:38:19.459 --> 01:38:20.459
Let's go, guys.

01:40:36.084 --> 01:40:38.174
IDs please?

01:40:38.292 --> 01:40:39.922
Passport.

01:40:42.875 --> 01:40:44.665
Thank you.

01:40:46.959 --> 01:40:54.289
We put them all here in an enclosure,
but it's inhumane, it's shameful.

01:40:54.667 --> 01:40:58.537
School isn't in session,
can't we put them there?

01:40:58.667 --> 01:41:03.327
There's 12 of them, got it?
They're human beings, theoretically.

01:41:07.042 --> 01:41:08.872
Mister.

01:41:24.459 --> 01:41:25.459
Here we are.

01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:26.500
Paul De Smedt.

01:41:26.542 --> 01:41:28.042
Morning.

01:41:28.209 --> 01:41:29.789
You can speak English or French.

01:41:39.584 --> 01:41:40.874
Take a seat.

01:41:51.792 --> 01:41:53.792
Are you hurt?

01:41:58.084 --> 01:42:00.084
Of course.

01:42:01.084 --> 01:42:03.124
I'll be sad forever.

01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:08.250
No, I'm...

01:42:10.250 --> 01:42:12.250
Yesterday...

01:42:13.875 --> 01:42:16.865
Paul, he has a wound.

01:42:22.917 --> 01:42:24.917
Did you see it?

01:42:28.917 --> 01:42:30.707
Yeah.

01:42:39.875 --> 01:42:42.535
Here. On the side.

01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:46.169
Do you understand me? Don't talk!

01:42:47.042 --> 01:42:51.422
Maybe you didn't understand,
I'm not asking for a favour,

01:42:51.542 --> 01:42:53.542
the fridge in Kamma is broken.

01:42:53.667 --> 01:42:59.577
Tell Giuppy to take out all the meat,
the corpse will go bad in this heat.

01:42:59.709 --> 01:43:04.209
Show some respect.
You're talking about my father.

01:43:04.792 --> 01:43:06.002
Is it too much to ask?

01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:11.290
You're right miss, sorry.

01:43:11.417 --> 01:43:12.747
I'll call you back.

01:43:12.875 --> 01:43:14.745
10 more minutes.

01:43:15.542 --> 01:43:19.292
Madam, would you follow me, please?

01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:29.120
Have a seat.

01:43:29.250 --> 01:43:33.080
We know you recovering from surgery
and it's not easy for you to talk.

01:43:35.459 --> 01:43:39.579
Turn off this phone,
it's been ringing for an hour!

01:43:48.459 --> 01:43:50.079
How long you
and Mr De Smedt friend?

01:43:54.917 --> 01:43:59.037
You were awake...
You were awake last night?

01:44:08.542 --> 01:44:11.582
Mario, give me a hand
looking for the IDs,

01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:13.579
or the Marshal will be pissed!

01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:15.709
Will he?

01:44:15.834 --> 01:44:18.924
Does he know where to look
in this mess here?

01:44:21.584 --> 01:44:23.794
The sand at the bottom of the pool...

01:44:25.542 --> 01:44:26.922
showed movement.

01:44:29.459 --> 01:44:32.039
As if several people were in the water...

01:44:34.209 --> 01:44:35.579
Or maybe only two.

01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.540
Two moving around a lot.

01:44:44.584 --> 01:44:46.004
Or maybe fighting.

01:44:46.167 --> 01:44:48.747
Oh!

01:44:54.125 --> 01:44:57.745
If you are talking about charging
Paul De Smedt,

01:44:57.917 --> 01:44:59.917
I need to call my lawyers.

01:45:06.459 --> 01:45:08.499
No, no, don't worry.

01:45:09.792 --> 01:45:13.792
What a beautiful bag... Beautiful...

01:45:35.459 --> 01:45:37.459
Maresciallo will found out
what happened.

01:45:43.209 --> 01:45:44.999
He must take care of other drownings.

01:45:47.167 --> 01:45:49.617
Yesterday,
seven immigrants died in the sea.

01:45:54.417 --> 01:45:57.867
Survivors are deported to
detention centres in the mainland.

01:46:03.667 --> 01:46:06.667
Immigrants in Lampedusa
are more than locals now.

01:46:09.084 --> 01:46:11.084
It's a tragedy.

01:46:13.209 --> 01:46:15.209
It start here, but go far.

01:46:16.459 --> 01:46:18.459
When did you find them?

01:46:22.834 --> 01:46:24.254
12:00, yesterday.

01:46:26.084 --> 01:46:28.464
And seven drowned in sea.

01:46:35.667 --> 01:46:37.497
There is a path.

01:46:37.667 --> 01:46:42.167
To the house.

01:46:42.334 --> 01:46:44.544
It comes up behind the pool.

01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:47.869
You saw it.

01:46:50.042 --> 01:46:53.212
And anybody could...

01:46:53.375 --> 01:46:56.785
come up there,

01:46:56.959 --> 01:47:01.959
when Mr Hawkes was swimming and...

01:47:02.125 --> 01:47:04.165
we would never have heard them.

01:47:07.167 --> 01:47:09.747
She's thinking of the refugees.

01:47:12.584 --> 01:47:14.424
He will ask them.

01:47:22.375 --> 01:47:25.455
They cannot be more offended
more than they already are.

01:47:25.584 --> 01:47:26.584
Poor things...

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.580
Ah, the girl.

01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:46.920
You and Mr De Smedt
have to stay here now,

01:47:47.084 --> 01:47:50.254
but the girl,
she can travel if she want.

01:47:50.459 --> 01:47:54.039
But she need
her mother to sign the letter,

01:47:54.209 --> 01:47:58.669
because minors cannot travel
without consent of the parents.

01:48:00.292 --> 01:48:01.832
She's underage, madam.

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:04.365
She's 17.

01:48:28.959 --> 01:48:34.169
Paul! Paul!

01:49:54.542 --> 01:49:59.542
I tried to save him.
I tried, I tried, I tried.

01:50:19.542 --> 01:50:23.172
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:50:30.584 --> 01:50:34.424
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

01:51:00.625 --> 01:51:02.245
Yeah?

01:51:02.417 --> 01:51:04.417
Hi, It's me.

01:51:05.542 --> 01:51:07.622
Huge fucking crowd out of there.

01:51:07.792 --> 01:51:10.372
They're turning people away.

01:51:10.542 --> 01:51:13.712
So, Derrick tells me that
Worried About You is off the set list.

01:51:13.875 --> 01:51:15.495
- Is that true?
- Mm-hm.

01:51:15.667 --> 01:51:18.037
Oh, for Christ's sake.

01:51:18.209 --> 01:51:21.369
- Harry, don't ask me to do...
- I'm not asking.

01:51:21.542 --> 01:51:23.542
sentimental things for you,
anymore.

01:51:23.709 --> 01:51:25.669
It's not fair on Paul.

01:51:25.834 --> 01:51:28.214
Stop that, would you? Just stop it.

01:51:28.375 --> 01:51:30.745
- Yeah.
- Marianne, it's time.

01:51:30.917 --> 01:51:32.417
Okay.

01:51:32.584 --> 01:51:35.464
It's not about fucking Paul.
You know that.

01:51:48.375 --> 01:51:51.535
Come on.
Why are you resisting me?

01:51:52.542 --> 01:51:54.542
It's done.

01:51:59.084 --> 01:52:01.174
Don't let it upset you.

01:52:01.334 --> 01:52:03.714
Marianne! Marianne!

01:53:22.875 --> 01:53:24.455
Well, do you want me
to let you know

01:53:24.625 --> 01:53:27.285
if there's some kind of service
for friends or something?

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Why did you lie to us?

01:53:32.167 --> 01:53:33.957
I didn't lie.

01:53:34.125 --> 01:53:36.915
You're not 22, you're 17.

01:53:37.084 --> 01:53:39.674
Christ, you're still in high school.

01:53:42.542 --> 01:53:44.752
You speak Italian.

01:53:44.917 --> 01:53:47.117
Yeah, yeah.

01:53:47.292 --> 01:53:50.872
And you sat there
over and over with people...

01:53:52.625 --> 01:53:56.745
struggling to communicate
with one another.

01:54:00.917 --> 01:54:04.537
You like to watch people
having a hard time.

01:54:04.709 --> 01:54:09.579
Is that it? Is that the kind
of woman you want to be?

01:54:11.292 --> 01:54:15.122
I would just rather be left alone.
It's different.

01:54:15.292 --> 01:54:19.422
No! That's not different.

01:54:24.875 --> 01:54:26.865
I wasn't your enemy.

01:54:27.959 --> 01:54:29.959
None of us was.

01:54:34.292 --> 01:54:36.502
Don't let it upset you, okay?

01:54:49.417 --> 01:54:52.577
Mm.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.370
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

01:56:34.542 --> 01:56:37.022
On behalf of our Alitalia crew,
we'd like to welcome you aboard

01:56:37.125 --> 01:56:39.115
this flight to Rome Fiumicino.

01:56:39.292 --> 01:56:42.752
Loading operations are being completed
and we'll be ready to leave shortly.

01:56:42.917 --> 01:56:46.247
The flying time will be approximately
one hour and ten minutes.

01:56:46.417 --> 01:56:48.917
Weather-wise,
whilst it's raining here in Pantelleria,

01:56:49.084 --> 01:56:51.004
the forecast for Rome is
bright and sunny

01:56:51.167 --> 01:56:53.367
with a temperature
of about 30 degrees Celsius.

01:56:53.542 --> 01:56:55.172
We thank you for flying with us.

01:57:24.125 --> 01:57:26.325
Madam!

01:57:27.459 --> 01:57:29.039
Madam!

01:57:31.125 --> 01:57:33.325
Ms. Lane, excuse me!

01:57:37.084 --> 01:57:38.754
I need to tell you something.

01:57:39.792 --> 01:57:40.792
Mario!

01:57:47.250 --> 01:57:49.210
Go away!

01:57:50.375 --> 01:57:51.705
Madam...

01:57:53.667 --> 01:57:56.577
Can you write your name, madam?

01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:59.709
My name?

01:58:00.209 --> 01:58:04.119
Your name, there? Write it?

01:58:04.250 --> 01:58:05.670
Okay.

01:58:13.792 --> 01:58:15.582
Your name.

01:58:16.042 --> 01:58:17.292
Carmelo.

01:58:17.792 --> 01:58:19.922
Carmelo, madam.

01:58:44.459 --> 01:58:47.419
Thanks, madam!
You are fantastic.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.290
You are fantastic.

01:58:49.667 --> 01:58:54.497
This is mine alone.
From you... to me.

01:58:54.625 --> 01:58:56.165
Mine alone, madam.

01:58:56.792 --> 01:58:58.582
Okay, I got to go.

01:58:58.750 --> 01:59:01.830
Yes, yes...

01:59:04.042 --> 01:59:05.922
Madam...

01:59:06.292 --> 01:59:08.252
You very nice people.

01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:12.289
You go home now.

01:59:40.125 --> 01:59:42.785
He's a fan.

01:59:42.959 --> 01:59:44.959
A fan.
