05:33.004 --> 05:34.059
I beg your pardon, Your Excellency?

05:34.060 --> 05:37.052
As a secret agent. There doesn't
seem to be any point to you.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.028
About three months ago...

05:42.024 --> 05:45.091
..I gave notice of an attack during
Duke Romauld's visit to Paris,

05:45.092 --> 05:48.023
which was telegraphed
to the French police...

05:48.024 --> 05:50.096
You passed a message on,
which didn't need heeding, anyway.

05:52.016 --> 05:53.071
But that's what I do, I...

05:53.072 --> 05:54.075
I inform.

05:54.076 --> 05:56.027
I'm an informer...

05:56.028 --> 05:59.011

with the anarchists... You are lazy.

So much more.

Any questions?

07:00.056 --> 07:02.080
Anything you don't see, just ask.

07:05.012 --> 07:06.035
This country is absurd,

07:06.036 --> 07:09.027
with its sentimental regard
for individual liberty.

07:09.028 --> 07:11.064
Harbouring convicted terrorists?
It's intolerable.

07:12.096 --> 07:14.031
First Secretary...

07:14.032 --> 07:16.059
I am ideally positioned
to prevent...

07:16.060 --> 07:19.059
You must provoke now, not prevent.
You must set them to work.

07:19.060 --> 07:21.063
England is in need
of a jolly good scare.

07:21.064 --> 07:24.055
An outrage that will summon
this country from its slumber.

07:24.056 --> 07:27.036
Unleash a law that will clamp down

is sensational enough, in a way,
though not as much as it used to be.

07:56.020 --> 07:58.003
It's almost conventional.

07:58.004 --> 08:00.035
The sacrosanct fetish of the day
is science.

08:00.036 --> 08:02.011
It's become the new measure
of progress,

08:02.012 --> 08:03.063
of how the world is ordered,

08:03.064 --> 08:05.076
of a civilisation moving forward.

08:07.052 --> 08:08.095
And here...

08:08.096 --> 08:11.003
we have the prime meridian.

08:11.004 --> 08:12.024
Zero longitude.

08:13.020 --> 08:15.083
The centre point of the Earth
that divides the world in two,

08:15.084 --> 08:18.032
that orders the world,
eastern and western.

08:19.036 --> 08:20.040
One line...

08:21.036 --> 08:22.079
..emanating...

08:22.080 --> 08:24.088
..from this building in Greenwich.

08:28.004 --> 08:29.048
Blow up the observatory?

08:30.048 --> 08:33.010
Well, it's a building,
so it needn't be particularly...

08:33.011 --> 08:34.051
sanguinary.

08:34.052 --> 08:36.067
And you'll have enlisted
your friends in the plot,

08:36.068 --> 08:38.032
so it shouldn't be too difficult.

08:39.068 --> 08:41.015
Of course, it would be symbolism,

08:41.015 --> 08:43.078
but at the same time, it would be
sheer, incomprehensible,

08:43.080 --> 08:46.055
random madness,
without regards for limits or sense.

08:46.056 --> 08:48.015
Pure destruction.

08:48.016 --> 08:51.043
An intention to make a clean sweep
of the whole social creation.

08:51.044 --> 08:52.072
And in that madness...

08:53.068 --> 08:55.075
..is true terrorism.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.080
True terrorism.

08:57.076 --> 08:59.020
Forgive me, Mr Vladimir.

09:00.092 --> 09:03.091
It's contemplation of the actual
deed I'm having difficulty with.

09:03.092 --> 09:05.063
How on Earth
am I meant to persuade them?

09:05.064 --> 09:07.079
Isn't that the business they're in?

09:07.080 --> 09:10.060
Isn't that the business you're
supposed to be in, provoking them?

09:11.088 --> 09:13.075
Well, then, go it alone.

09:13.076 --> 09:16.011

it was your friends' handiwork.

Now released,

he may be looking for revenge.

13:11.040 --> 13:16.999
Struggle and warfare is
the condition of private ownership.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.047
It is fatal to itself.

13:18.048 --> 13:22.027
Oh, I see. Capitalism sows
the seeds of its own destruction?

13:22.028 --> 13:25.011
So, therefore, we just sit back
and do nothing?

It isn't enough to just leave a few
bank tellers quivering.

13:36.084 --> 13:40.083

Europe, sir. Fled his own country.

We need to show that our intention

14:12.012 --> 14:14.076
is to sweep away the whole

14:21.036 --> 14:22.080
That is true terrorism.

we should refashion our tactics.

Attack the rich. That is
the only way.

15:17.020 --> 15:20.059
Yes. Yes, it is. Quite meaningless.

You all tolerate my company because
I know how chemicals combine.

16:25.060 --> 16:27.068
so what conclusion am I to draw?

16:31.040 --> 16:33.075
Well, you can
go to the Conference in Milan, sir.

that as long as we keep our eye
on this cell,

16:41.064 --> 16:43.024
they are capable of nothing.

16:44.036 --> 16:45.060
Nothing whatsoever.

17:01.064 --> 17:03.052
It appears you have no takers.

17:08.076 --> 17:09.079
Will you help me?

17:13.088 --> 17:15.048
I'll listen to what you have to say.

17:30.040 --> 17:33.004
SHOP BELL TINKLES

17:51.056 --> 17:53.087
Was it Yundt? Mr Yundt!

17:53.088 --> 17:55.031
HE WHIMPERS

17:55.032 --> 17:57.019
I don't know why you put up with it.

17:57.020 --> 17:59.075
You know what it does to Stevie.

17:59.076 --> 18:01.027
Anton needs an outlet.

18:01.028 --> 18:04.087
If they're in there trying to put the world
to rights, I can't begrudge him that.

18:04.088 --> 18:06.067
It's just a bunch of men
letting off steam.

18:06.068 --> 18:10.011
Mr Verloc wasn't just letting
off steam. You didn't hear him.

18:10.012 --> 18:12.048
He was talking about violence,
Winnie.

18:13.068 --> 18:15.051
Talking about it?

18:15.052 --> 18:18.043
I remember Daddy doing more than
talk about it.

18:18.044 --> 18:20.047
He didn't understand him,
that's all!

18:20.048 --> 18:22.036
And you don't understand Anton!

18:25.052 --> 18:26.096
Come on, Stevie. Bedtime.

18:42.012 --> 18:44.024
Kitchen not big
enough for two women?

19:02.080 --> 19:03.084
What's wrong?

19:06.076 --> 19:07.096
Headache.

19:10.032 --> 19:12.012
Starting to not feel very well.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.047
Did you remember to take
the cashbox out of the shop?

19:23.048 --> 19:26.051
Ever the pragmatist, Winnie!

19:26.052 --> 19:30.004
Well, we wouldn't want your headache
getting any worse, would we?

19:31.020 --> 19:33.063
Mind you, you'd have noticed it
was lighter than normal.

19:33.064 --> 19:34.068
Takings are down.

19:41.036 --> 19:43.004
I'll do what needs to be done.

19:44.068 --> 19:45.091
What does that mean?

19:45.092 --> 19:47.083
CRASH
MUFFLED GRUNTING

19:47.084 --> 19:49.008
Anton!

19:50.012 --> 19:51.999
Be careful.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.004
I won't let them eat me!
I won't let them eat me!

19:56.000 --> 19:57.092
I won't let them eat me!

19:59.032 --> 20:01.015
Don't let them eat me!

20:01.016 --> 20:02.043
Winnie's coming.

20:02.044 --> 20:04.055
Don't let them eat me! Don't!

20:04.056 --> 20:07.031
Stevie! There's knives here, Winnie.
Knives here!

20:07.032 --> 20:09.075
Knives here! Knives here!

20:09.076 --> 20:11.999
Stevie, it's not true.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.039
Help me! Stevie. Help me!

20:14.040 --> 20:17.055
No-one's going to eat you or
anybody. It's a just a tale.

20:17.056 --> 20:18.999
Help me! It's just a fairytale.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.055
It's just a bunch of silly men
saying the first thing that

20:21.056 --> 20:23.027
comes into their heads.

20:23.028 --> 20:24.052
Isn't that so, Anton?

20:26.064 --> 20:28.091
Words, that's all.

20:28.092 --> 20:30.051
Bunch of silly men.

20:30.052 --> 20:32.071
Don't worry, Stevie.

20:32.072 --> 20:34.004
No-one's going to hurt you.

20:35.016 --> 20:36.044
Come on.

20:40.068 --> 20:41.072
Mind the knives.

20:47.012 --> 20:49.080
There's a lot to clear
up in the morning, Stevie.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.088
Stevie's made quite a mess,
hasn't he?

20:59.016 --> 21:00.036
I can forbear that.

21:17.032 --> 21:21.012
BIRDS CHIRPING

21:47.028 --> 21:49.067
You walked along far too quickly.

21:49.068 --> 21:51.055
As if you were in a hurry.

21:51.056 --> 21:54.027
It's not good at all, really.
Amateur.

21:54.028 --> 21:56.035
You're very cocksure
all of a sudden.

21:56.036 --> 21:57.039
Oh, Mr Verloc.

21:57.040 --> 22:00.091
Have you not already found me
to be a wolf in sheep's clothing?

22:00.092 --> 22:03.000
A lone wolf. What should I do?

22:05.008 --> 22:06.043
Admire the chitchat of you

22:06.044 --> 22:08.047
and your friends every
Tuesday night?

22:08.048 --> 22:10.011
That's true.

22:10.012 --> 22:12.063
They talk too much but

22:12.064 --> 22:14.051
you are all words yourself.

22:14.052 --> 22:16.039
Provocative ones, mind, but...

22:16.040 --> 22:19.036
I mean exactly what I say.
Now be explicit yourself.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.072
Can you supply a bomb?

22:25.004 --> 22:27.039
I can supply a bomb.
That's one thing.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.020
But the main thing is, will you
explode it?

22:35.032 --> 22:38.052
That needs a cool head.
And you are a hot flush.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.095
Do you know the most frequent
customers

22:42.096 --> 22:46.036
to my shop are from Parliament
and the pulpit?

22:50.060 --> 22:54.027
The men who uphold the social
order of this country are not only

22:54.028 --> 22:56.096
rank hypocrites, but their tastes...

23:00.008 --> 23:01.040
..beyond the limit.

23:03.008 --> 23:06.084
I'd have them dragged out into plain
sight and torn apart.

23:07.096 --> 23:10.032
Their skin
and their pretence laid bare.

23:12.072 --> 23:14.059
But I must ask you something.

23:14.060 --> 23:17.027
In order to accomplish
your mission,

23:17.028 --> 23:18.084
would you do so even at the cost...

23:20.080 --> 23:22.016
..of your own life?

23:28.040 --> 23:29.044
I see.

23:31.080 --> 23:32.084
Look.

23:34.008 --> 23:37.003
What I have in mind is a
building, an important building.

23:37.004 --> 23:39.031
Symbolic of this country
and everything...

23:39.032 --> 23:41.027
No death, just destruction?

23:41.028 --> 23:44.035
What, you will be a conscientious
terrorist, will you?

23:44.036 --> 23:46.055
Well, that won't wash,
not with me, Verloc.

23:46.056 --> 23:50.011
I prefer to give my stuff to people who
are deadly. People who have character.

23:50.012 --> 23:52.092
Who have no illusions
about what it is they are in.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.004
Think again.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.004
SHOP BELL TINKLES

24:22.052 --> 24:25.027
This isn't quite the excitement
people come in here looking for.

24:25.028 --> 24:29.019
Given out at discount,
they may yet become receptive to it.

24:29.020 --> 24:32.043
And their passions turning to
a different kind of struggle.

24:32.044 --> 24:33.048
Perhaps.

24:35.024 --> 24:37.087
Now here's some excitement
given out freely.

24:37.088 --> 24:38.999
Circles!

24:39.000 --> 24:42.063
Circles, circles, circles, circles,
circles, circles,

24:42.064 --> 24:43.075
Mr Ossipon! Tom!

24:43.076 --> 24:45.091
And very good circles they are too.

24:45.092 --> 24:48.008
Very...round. Mmm?

24:49.032 --> 24:51.063
Can I take this with me?

24:51.064 --> 24:53.999
No! Greedy! Showing only!

24:54.000 --> 24:55.083
Say how many, Mr Ossipon! Tom!

24:55.084 --> 24:57.039
Stevie, let Mr Ossipon get on now.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.044
Not at all.

24:59.044 --> 25:01.003
Now...

25:01.004 --> 25:04.027
COUNTS SOFTLY IN FRENCH

25:04.028 --> 25:06.060
22. 21!

25:07.072 --> 25:09.036
Then have you got room for one more?

25:10.052 --> 25:12.051
One more! Mmm.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.035
One more! One more, Winnie!

25:14.036 --> 25:15.999
One more!

25:16.000 --> 25:17.063
One more!

25:17.064 --> 25:19.047
There's some scientific
fools who dismiss

25:19.048 --> 25:21.063
boys like Stevie as degenerates.

25:21.064 --> 25:24.023
I had a doctor inspecting
the lobes of his ears once.

25:24.024 --> 25:25.079
As if that might explain something.

25:25.080 --> 25:29.999
Nonsense! He can write
and read and draw

25:30.000 --> 25:31.028
and he's full of life...

25:33.020 --> 25:34.028
..because you are.

25:42.020 --> 25:46.047
It seems Verloc and the Professor are having their
own private encounter. Just the two of them?

25:46.048 --> 25:48.024
Not the usual kind of meeting at
all, sir.

25:50.032 --> 25:52.004
Let's have our own encounter.

26:13.020 --> 26:14.052
Two whiskies, please.

26:15.084 --> 26:18.039
Thought you might like a bit
of company, Professor.

26:18.040 --> 26:22.011
Chief Inspector Heat,
Special Crimes Division.

26:22.012 --> 26:25.059
Don't matter what you say about them
"revolutionary" friends of yours,

26:25.060 --> 26:28.004
you can't really go to the pub
with them, can you?!

26:29.000 --> 26:32.031
To be honest,
I don't even know why you bother.

26:32.032 --> 26:36.031
Better hobbies out there for a
lonely fellow like you to pursue.

26:36.032 --> 26:37.092
What do you want?

26:43.008 --> 26:45.019
Why are you meeting Verloc
away from the others?

26:45.020 --> 26:46.055
What are you talking about?

26:46.056 --> 26:48.055
Suddenly I am a
"person of interest"?

26:48.056 --> 26:50.075
Actually, you're a person of very
little interest.

26:50.076 --> 26:53.011
But if you're going to have
independent conversations

26:53.012 --> 26:56.079
with the bigger boys in this
network, then it's my duty to ask.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.024
You think I'm in thrall to them?

26:59.032 --> 27:01.079
They must seem very exciting

27:01.080 --> 27:05.031
for a person with such a humdrum
life like you.

27:05.032 --> 27:08.011
You couldn't even remain a lab
technician.

27:08.012 --> 27:10.096
Now you want to dabble in a bit
of subversion and feel all heroic.

27:12.024 --> 27:14.028
If I am such a fantasist,
Chief Inspector...

27:16.024 --> 27:17.028
..explain this.

27:20.036 --> 27:22.019
You say I'm friendless?

27:22.020 --> 27:25.019
Oh, no, Inspector, I am very
attached to this.

27:25.020 --> 27:27.023
I always walk with my left hand

27:27.024 --> 27:30.999
closed around this India-rubber
ball that I keep in my pocket.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.999
And the pressing of this
ball actuates

27:33.000 --> 27:35.027
a detonator inside this
flask in my jacket.

27:35.028 --> 27:38.047
It's the principle of the
instantaneous shutter of a camera.

27:38.048 --> 27:41.043
The tube leads up here
and round into the flask.

27:41.044 --> 27:43.999
The detonator is part mechanical,
part chemical.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.083
Now, this pressing of the ball,
that starts everything rolling.

27:46.084 --> 27:50.051
What? And lead to your own
destruction? And yours...

27:50.052 --> 27:53.052
and his and God knows how many more
besides.

27:55.032 --> 27:58.004
As for myself,
I am the least of it.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.064
What use would you be?

28:02.016 --> 28:03.088
I will have served my purpose.

28:05.076 --> 28:10.003
Oh, I've no doubt the newspapers
will give you a very good obituary.

28:10.004 --> 28:13.003
Chief Inspector Heat,
"implacable enemy of terror".

28:13.004 --> 28:15.004
The man who kept us
safe in our beds.

28:16.040 --> 28:18.032
But you'd be buried alongside me.

28:19.052 --> 28:23.000
Mark no doubt your friends will make an
effort to sort us out as much as possible.

28:24.068 --> 28:25.075
Give this up.

28:25.076 --> 28:28.088
To deal with me, you'd require
sheer, naked, inglorious heroism.

28:30.004 --> 28:31.020
Do you possess such?

28:44.000 --> 28:46.068
You can't win this game.
We're too many for you!

29:07.064 --> 29:08.068
What now, sir?

29:12.092 --> 29:14.052
SHOP BELL TINKLES

29:17.092 --> 29:19.052
I've come to see Mr Verloc.

29:20.080 --> 29:22.007
Is he expecting you?

29:22.008 --> 29:23.024
I wouldn't think so.

29:31.004 --> 29:33.060
Anton, you have a visitor.

29:54.012 --> 29:56.004
You still importing from
the Continent?

29:58.028 --> 30:00.999
Everything you see here is legal,
Chief Inspector.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.079
What about what I can't see, Verloc?

30:02.080 --> 30:05.075
I could have the customs house
men down here any time.

30:05.076 --> 30:07.003
Confiscation.

30:07.004 --> 30:08.072
Prosecution. Prison.

30:10.012 --> 30:11.024
What is it you want?

30:13.000 --> 30:15.020
The services of my sometime
informer.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.075
It's been two years
since I've seen you.

30:19.076 --> 30:21.060
And two hours
since you saw the Professor.

30:23.072 --> 30:25.051
Are you following me?

30:25.052 --> 30:28.035
It's all right.
It's only him I want.

30:28.036 --> 30:29.084
Have you got an address for him?

30:46.072 --> 30:48.059
Why was it just the two of you?

30:48.060 --> 30:49.076
What did he want?

30:50.076 --> 30:52.008
What did he talk about?

30:53.088 --> 30:56.027
If your associates were to find out
that you were being

30:56.028 --> 30:59.007
paid by the Russian Embassy
to spy on them,

30:59.008 --> 31:00.060
it could end in your death.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.060
He wants to supply me
with explosives.

31:07.088 --> 31:09.055
The meeting ended badly.

31:09.056 --> 31:10.072
He went away.

31:12.088 --> 31:13.092
Didn't trust me.

31:14.084 --> 31:17.063
When do you think he realised you
weren't all you seemed?

31:17.064 --> 31:18.068
Did he smell a rat?

31:28.048 --> 31:30.020
Why were you talking
about explosives?

31:34.068 --> 31:36.012
I was just being provocative.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.084
It's my job.

This is nonsense.

32:10.052 --> 32:13.059
A good, charitable arrangement
from the brewery for widows like me.

It will work very well for me!

32:18.036 --> 32:19.071
And what about us?

32:19.072 --> 32:21.028
You must look after your own family.

is your home any more?

32:27.052 --> 32:29.004

32:42.084 --> 32:44.055
Perhaps it's a practical solution.

32:44.056 --> 32:47.015
What about Stevie? Look, Winnie.

Threaten me! I'll...

33:36.052 --> 33:38.043
Too much.

33:38.044 --> 33:40.016
I will be too much for them.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.051
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:55.052 --> 33:58.064
I am delighted to welcome
Mr Michaelis to our salon.

33:59.064 --> 34:00.067
Please.

34:00.068 --> 34:02.028
CLAPPING

34:05.068 --> 34:06.087
Mr Vladimir.

34:06.088 --> 34:09.087
So, Special Crimes releases
its anarchists and murderers?

34:09.088 --> 34:11.083
He is involved with
the killing of a policeman

34:11.083 --> 34:14.036
and is then indulged by romantic
liberals as the victim.

34:15.036 --> 34:17.087
He was given a life
sentence as an accessory.

34:17.088 --> 34:21.003
Besides, the man can't help but be
chastened after 15 years in prison.

34:21.004 --> 34:22.067
Or embittered by his incarceration,

34:22.068 --> 34:25.051
intent on achieving new
heights of radical depravity,

34:25.052 --> 34:29.014
a campaign unwittingly
funded by the Lady Patroness.

34:29.016 --> 34:31.079
Oh, I love the British
justice system,

34:31.080 --> 34:33.088
renowned for its humanitarianism.

34:35.004 --> 34:36.047
That's most kind.

34:36.047 --> 34:39.034
Don't you realise the kind of people
you have in your midst?

34:39.036 --> 34:41.059
Some of them
are your people too, aren't they?

34:41.060 --> 34:43.091
Oh, absolutely. On the run from all
kinds of outrages.

34:43.092 --> 34:45.059
They won't commit any here.

34:45.060 --> 34:49.032
The way your institutions stand
on ceremony? I am sure they will.

34:52.068 --> 34:54.000
If you'll excuse me.

34:56.047 --> 34:58.012
He will make fools of you all.

34:59.044 --> 35:02.060
Mr Michaelis, this is my husband,
Assistant Commissioner Stone.

35:03.092 --> 35:06.095
I can assure you I'm here socially
not professionally.

35:06.096 --> 35:10.063
And enjoying Lady Blackwood's
hospitality.

35:10.064 --> 35:13.999
I bear no enmity.
I am a ticket of leave man.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.036
My freedom co...

35:16.044 --> 35:18.079
..conditional.

35:18.080 --> 35:21.027
My appreciation of it boundless.

35:21.028 --> 35:24.063
Mr Michaelis is going to my cottage
in Kent to write a book,

35:24.064 --> 35:25.083
a memoir!

35:25.084 --> 35:27.055
How extraordinary is that?

35:27.056 --> 35:28.071
That's...

35:28.072 --> 35:30.072
Quite. Quite.

35:38.044 --> 35:40.007
There's no need to come with me.

35:40.008 --> 35:41.079
Don't be silly.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.088
Where are we going?

35:44.004 --> 35:45.051
When are you going to tell him?

35:45.052 --> 35:47.031
On the way.

35:47.032 --> 35:48.083
Come on, Stevie.

35:48.084 --> 35:50.044
I want to sit up by the horse!

35:52.032 --> 35:53.036
Wait for me.

35:55.068 --> 35:57.083
Look after yourself.

35:57.084 --> 35:58.088
Look after them.

36:00.036 --> 36:02.051
Whoa.

36:02.052 --> 36:04.047
Good...good boy.

36:04.048 --> 36:07.000
Good boy. Don't make him
go too fast.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.063
No. No.

36:21.064 --> 36:22.999
Mummy doesn't go in there!

36:23.000 --> 36:25.052
Stevie. Look. Stevie. Mummy doesn't
go away from me!

36:27.044 --> 36:31.003
Mummy doesn't go in there! You'll come and
see me every Sunday, won't you, Stevie?

36:31.004 --> 36:33.031
Get the omnibus over here.
Like a big boy.

36:33.032 --> 36:35.004
I'll get lost! No.

36:36.040 --> 36:39.071
No. No. That's Mummy's.

36:39.072 --> 36:43.059
You didn't need to do this at all, Mother. He'll
be fine with you. As long as there's you.

36:43.060 --> 36:46.004
Don't touch them.
They're Mummy's things. And Anton.

36:48.016 --> 36:50.063
Did...did I make you do this?

36:50.064 --> 36:51.095
Did I make you?

36:51.096 --> 36:53.047
I'm sorry, Mummy.

36:53.048 --> 36:55.031
Stevie, you're a good boy.

36:55.032 --> 36:57.039
Daddy didn't think I was a good boy.

36:57.040 --> 37:00.056
Well, Daddy's not here any more. You
have Mr Verloc as your guardian now.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.063
I made a good match, Mother.

37:03.064 --> 37:05.015
How do you really know?

37:05.016 --> 37:06.047
HE WHIMPERS

37:06.048 --> 37:08.059
These things don't bear too much
looking into

37:08.060 --> 37:10.047
as long as he's good to us.

37:10.048 --> 37:13.023
Come on, Stevie.
Say goodbye now, we've got to go.

37:13.024 --> 37:14.027
See her soon, eh?

37:14.028 --> 37:16.055
HE CRIES
Yes. Yes.

37:16.056 --> 37:19.019
She won't see me.
She doesn't like me!

37:19.020 --> 37:20.075
Stevie! She doesn't.

37:20.076 --> 37:21.080
Stevie!

37:36.000 --> 37:38.007
Wurmt! Wurmt!

37:38.008 --> 37:40.020
Wurmt! I need to see the First
Secretary!

37:41.020 --> 37:42.060
I can't do what he wants.

37:46.008 --> 37:47.052
Wurmt!

38:06.048 --> 38:08.047
Stevie!

38:08.048 --> 38:11.084
You shouldn't have just run off like that.
Anything could have happened to you.

38:13.064 --> 38:15.051
What will happen to me?

38:15.052 --> 38:18.039
Nothing.
Everything'll stay the same.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.059
Really the same?

38:19.060 --> 38:21.083
Yes, Stevie, because you've got me.

38:21.084 --> 38:22.095
Yes.

38:22.096 --> 38:25.028
Yes. And no-one's ever taking that
away.

38:26.056 --> 38:28.071
No. No.

38:28.072 --> 38:29.076
Come on.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.056
SHOP BELL TINKLES

38:49.072 --> 38:50.084
What did you mean?

38:55.016 --> 38:56.020
Eh?

38:59.004 --> 39:01.016
You said you had
troubles of your own.

39:10.004 --> 39:12.004
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

39:14.084 --> 39:16.000
Tell me.

39:21.056 --> 39:22.076
Anton?

39:24.088 --> 39:25.092
The shop.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.004
You were right.

39:31.008 --> 39:32.080
The figures just don't add up.

39:35.020 --> 39:36.028
Nothing's adding up.

39:38.056 --> 39:41.031
As for us, I'm sure we'll be all
right.

39:41.032 --> 39:43.032
You always find a way to
make things work.

40:10.076 --> 40:13.011
What's wrong with him?
He looks like a sick dog.

40:13.012 --> 40:17.023
He misses having something to do.
He misses Mother.

40:17.024 --> 40:18.043
He needs routine.

40:18.044 --> 40:20.024
He needs things to settle down.

40:22.088 --> 40:24.091
I thought maybe
he could help you out in the shop.

40:24.092 --> 40:27.071
You could show him the ropes.
He'd really enjoy it. Don't.

40:27.072 --> 40:28.092
Don't what?

40:30.016 --> 40:31.080
Make plans for me.

40:33.044 --> 40:35.072
Everyone's
always making plans for me!

40:57.076 --> 40:59.020
Sir. Sir.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.052
I was told to take you with me.

41:06.096 --> 41:08.000
Who by?

41:39.028 --> 41:40.032
Verloc.

41:42.012 --> 41:43.016
Boy.

41:46.088 --> 41:49.048
I've cut the bottom out of this
one-gallon Copal varnish can.

41:51.028 --> 41:52.999
The can

41:53.000 --> 41:54.004
encloses this...

41:55.036 --> 41:56.072
That...

41:58.048 --> 42:00.056
..is encased in wet clay...

42:01.072 --> 42:05.044
..and it contains 16oz of X2 powder.

42:06.060 --> 42:08.079
The detonator

42:08.080 --> 42:12.019
will be connected with
the screw top of the can.

42:12.020 --> 42:14.083
It will work on a combination
of time and shock.

42:14.084 --> 42:17.027
Why are you willing to help me now?

42:17.028 --> 42:18.047
You weren't before...

42:18.048 --> 42:19.083
Come.

42:19.084 --> 42:20.088
Look at this.

42:31.088 --> 42:33.020
What's wrong with you?

42:37.020 --> 42:38.095
It's becoming real.

42:38.096 --> 42:41.047
You're not having second
thoughts, are you, Verloc?

42:41.048 --> 42:42.076
I can't.

42:44.016 --> 42:46.011
I'm set on this course...

42:46.012 --> 42:47.047
regardless.

42:47.048 --> 42:48.064
Regardless of what?

42:58.080 --> 42:59.084
This is a war.

43:01.008 --> 43:05.003
You can't get away with making just
some kind of gesture.

43:05.004 --> 43:07.092
People will die.
You do understand that, don't you?

43:09.072 --> 43:10.076
I just need a bomb.

43:18.024 --> 43:19.028
Leave it with me.

43:48.068 --> 43:50.012
You seem in a better mood.

43:51.072 --> 43:54.040
I suppose a few pints of beer
can do that to a man.

43:57.040 --> 44:00.056
I've been thinking. This boy
needs to get out more.

44:02.020 --> 44:05.011
You know how I am for my little
"journeys".

44:05.012 --> 44:06.095
I need a walking companion.

44:06.096 --> 44:09.003
To the park for a start.

44:09.004 --> 44:10.087
Did you hear that, Stevie?

44:10.088 --> 44:11.095
Park!

44:11.096 --> 44:14.051
Oh, thank you, Anton. He needs
something to look forward to.

44:14.052 --> 44:16.064
Don't you? Yes. Yes.

44:18.092 --> 44:20.048
Perhaps my reward will be in heaven.

44:22.056 --> 44:24.019
You believe in heaven?

44:24.020 --> 44:26.056
I didn't think that was
the stuff of revolutionaries.

44:28.040 --> 44:30.012
I have my weaknesses, Winnie.

44:32.088 --> 44:34.087
If you can't wait for your reward
until then,

44:34.088 --> 44:36.060
we could go upstairs shortly.

44:39.024 --> 44:41.032
Be good to forget myself for a
while.

45:01.052 --> 45:03.044
Out we go. All right, come on, then.

45:04.096 --> 45:06.000
Have fun.

45:09.008 --> 45:11.023
Could be father and son!

45:11.024 --> 45:13.004
It's such a lovely sight, Anton!

45:14.060 --> 45:15.064
Bye.

45:26.088 --> 45:29.055
What intelligence is to be had
watching me

45:29.056 --> 45:32.059
take a defective
relative for a walk?

45:32.060 --> 45:34.063
Father and son,

45:34.064 --> 45:35.068
commendable.

45:36.084 --> 45:39.071
But it doesn't change the fact
you're in the embassy's pay...

45:39.072 --> 45:40.091
and still in my debt.

45:40.092 --> 45:43.019
And what if I'm out of it?
All of it.

45:43.020 --> 45:46.036
Free to live a simple life
between the shop and the park.

45:48.008 --> 45:50.071
Is that your fervent wish?

45:50.072 --> 45:52.024
Yes.

45:55.052 --> 45:58.007
Any idea where the Professor is?

45:58.008 --> 46:02.055
Inspector Heat,
I tell you this now...

46:02.056 --> 46:04.024
I am no longer of use.

46:08.076 --> 46:10.056
DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE

46:12.020 --> 46:13.028
HE WHISTLES

46:14.056 --> 46:15.084
Hello.

46:20.040 --> 46:22.051
We shamed him, Stevie.

46:22.052 --> 46:26.031
He had to get out of our way
and leave us alone.

46:26.032 --> 46:28.004
How could he do anything else?

46:32.088 --> 46:34.035
Thank you.

46:34.036 --> 46:35.040
SHOP BELL TINKLES

46:44.040 --> 46:47.076
Prominently displayed, Winnie.
Prominently displayed.

46:56.016 --> 47:00.083
Are you not ever...affronted by
what you pass across this counter?

47:00.084 --> 47:02.092
I find the main thing is
not to blush.

47:04.056 --> 47:06.095
Does it not offend
your morals, though?

47:06.096 --> 47:08.084
"Needs must" is my morals.

47:09.088 --> 47:12.059
Anyway, I thought yours
was "freedom of the individual".

47:12.060 --> 47:16.023
Well, I think the act of love should
be an act of love.

47:16.024 --> 47:20.000
An affirmation. Now, if you could
ever find such love...

47:21.040 --> 47:25.003
..the joy would be...would be real.

47:25.004 --> 47:26.079
I think I'm blushing now.

47:26.080 --> 47:29.019
Something new has come your way?

47:29.020 --> 47:32.067
Heading in the direction
of your heart, maybe.

47:32.068 --> 47:34.076
If so I'll have to see it off,
won't I?

47:38.004 --> 47:39.020
Why?

47:40.060 --> 47:42.048
Because Anton is good to me.

47:52.004 --> 47:53.008
MAN GROWLS

47:55.072 --> 47:58.020
STEVIE CHUCKLES
Beard.

48:07.076 --> 48:09.015
Wolfman.

48:09.016 --> 48:10.080
He's the wolfman.

48:13.096 --> 48:15.031
I've lost my hat.

48:15.032 --> 48:17.095
Hup! Hup!

48:17.096 --> 48:20.007
Hup! Come on.

48:20.008 --> 48:22.063
Hey, hey, hey.

48:22.064 --> 48:25.031
Hup! Hup! Andiamo!

48:25.032 --> 48:29.043
It's a beautiful creature
trapped behind bars, Stevie.

48:29.044 --> 48:31.095
At the whim of his master.

48:31.096 --> 48:35.075
Locked in, lonely, so unhappy.

48:35.076 --> 48:37.035
Animal from the jungle.

48:37.036 --> 48:40.019
That's what it should be. Free.

48:40.020 --> 48:41.023
I'm free.

48:41.024 --> 48:43.087
None of us are, Stevie.

48:43.088 --> 48:47.043
You know, I have known men who
have had their tongues...

48:47.044 --> 48:51.019
ripped out because of what
they've spoken about.

48:51.020 --> 48:52.087
They've had flesh torn from them

48:52.088 --> 48:54.079
because they won't tell
their secrets,

48:54.080 --> 48:57.027
tell tales on their friends.

48:57.028 --> 49:00.091
No. No, we are -
we're animals too, Stevie,

49:00.092 --> 49:05.023
trapped in a cage, and on the
inside, we cry like these animals.

49:05.024 --> 49:06.091
Listen to it. Listen.

49:06.092 --> 49:09.043
LION GROANS
Do you hear that?

49:09.044 --> 49:12.087
That noise is pain, Stevie.

49:12.088 --> 49:14.008
Ah, pain.

49:17.012 --> 49:19.035
Pain...

49:19.036 --> 49:20.052
Pain...

49:23.092 --> 49:25.028
GROANING

49:37.008 --> 49:39.051
Is this the place?

49:39.052 --> 49:42.035
Is this the wicked place where
they lock them up, Mr Verloc?

49:42.036 --> 49:43.040
Yes, Stevie.

49:50.044 --> 49:51.048
So...

49:55.068 --> 50:00.020
..we have to make a hole
in the building and let them out.

50:03.024 --> 50:06.060
Let them come through the hole
and be free.

50:08.052 --> 50:09.088
Free.

50:18.060 --> 50:21.043
I can confirm there is absolutely no
need for additional officers.

50:21.044 --> 50:22.048
Yes.

50:25.060 --> 50:27.071
You look rather grave, Heat.
What is it?

50:27.072 --> 50:29.051
It's the Professor, sir...

50:29.052 --> 50:30.067
The hanger-on?

50:30.068 --> 50:32.091
The one who's promoted himself
from lab technician?

50:32.092 --> 50:35.095
The trouble is, he's a bit more
of a threat than we first thought.

50:35.096 --> 50:37.063
In what way?

50:37.064 --> 50:39.040
He has a bomb.

50:40.048 --> 50:43.020
He wears it inside his jacket.

50:44.084 --> 50:46.076
I think he might use it.

50:53.068 --> 50:55.075
52, Winnie.

50:55.076 --> 50:58.059
Thank you, Stevie.
You have been busy at the park.

50:58.060 --> 50:59.083
Greenwich Park!

50:59.084 --> 51:02.003
Greenwich Park?
Mmm.

51:02.004 --> 51:04.039
That's a long way from here.

51:04.040 --> 51:06.080
Gave the boy a bit of an adventure.

51:10.052 --> 51:13.088
So composed now.
The change in this boy...

51:18.008 --> 51:21.071
Imagine the good a few days
in the country would do for him.

51:21.072 --> 51:23.999
The country?

51:24.000 --> 51:26.999
Freedom to roam, talk man to man -

51:27.000 --> 51:29.067
I could put him
right on a few things.

51:29.068 --> 51:31.031
He'd take it in down there.

51:31.032 --> 51:33.095
Why ever would you want to take him
to the country?

51:33.096 --> 51:36.080
I was thinking we could visit
Michaelis in Kent.

51:38.096 --> 51:41.031
A sort of outing?

51:41.032 --> 51:42.036
Exactly!

51:45.028 --> 51:47.036
And then you two become much closer.

51:49.008 --> 51:50.039
He's never had it, Anton.

51:50.040 --> 51:52.079
Not from his father,
not from any man.

51:52.080 --> 51:54.012
Well, then.

51:55.020 --> 51:57.019
This is some change.

51:57.020 --> 51:59.043
For the better.

51:59.044 --> 52:00.064
Oi!

52:01.096 --> 52:03.080
Let's make a plan.

52:38.016 --> 52:40.072
Do you know what a secret is,
Stevie?

52:43.008 --> 52:45.091
The necessity of silence.

52:45.092 --> 52:47.055
Silence.

52:47.056 --> 52:53.048
It means saying nothing when
you're asked what we talk about.

52:56.040 --> 52:57.047
Police?

52:57.048 --> 53:00.055
Especially not the police.

53:00.056 --> 53:02.060
Not even Winnie must know.

53:05.016 --> 53:06.044
Not even Winnie.

53:14.076 --> 53:15.083
Ready?

53:15.084 --> 53:17.000
Ready.

53:18.056 --> 53:21.047
You're going to have such
a good time, Stevie.

53:21.048 --> 53:23.067
Busy. Carefree.

53:23.068 --> 53:25.007
You can do what you like.

53:25.008 --> 53:26.083
Mr Verloc's in charge of me.

53:26.084 --> 53:29.023
Yeah, of course he is,
but he wants you to enjoy yourself.

53:29.024 --> 53:30.040
I won't let him down.

53:34.004 --> 53:35.032
There you go.

53:43.044 --> 53:44.092
Come on, then.

53:46.036 --> 53:48.031
Could be father and son.

53:48.032 --> 53:49.080
SHOP BELL TINKLES

53:56.072 --> 53:59.036
Busy, Mr Verloc. Lots of people.

54:01.016 --> 54:03.064
Train to Michaelis' cottage.

54:07.004 --> 54:08.024
Oh!

54:09.088 --> 54:11.096
Hello. Are you coming too?

54:13.024 --> 54:14.088
I'll be there in spirit.

54:19.028 --> 54:22.011
How far is Michaelis's
cottage from Greenwich?

54:22.012 --> 54:24.999
Ten miles. We'll lay low
there for a few days

54:25.000 --> 54:26.999
and go through things with the boy.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.095
What does he know?

54:28.096 --> 54:30.015
That it's a holiday.

54:30.016 --> 54:31.999
Where's the train?
WHISTLE BLOWS

54:32.000 --> 54:33.023
Soon...
All aboard!

54:33.024 --> 54:35.071
Not now, Stevie. Soon.

54:35.072 --> 54:38.087
Hide your deed behind
a harmless boy - very clever.

54:38.088 --> 54:40.048
Playing the doting father.

54:41.060 --> 54:43.020
No-one will even notice me.

54:44.092 --> 54:46.080
You're not the bravest, are you?

54:48.068 --> 54:52.015
When you screw the top on tight,
it makes a connection.

54:52.016 --> 54:54.055
Set at 20 minutes,
but a short sharp shock...

54:54.056 --> 54:56.075
be careful.

54:56.076 --> 54:58.035
Can we go now?

54:58.036 --> 55:00.007
Yeah.

55:00.008 --> 55:02.004
Time to act, Verloc.

55:17.036 --> 55:18.060
Come on, Stevie.

55:47.048 --> 55:49.091
WINNIE: Mr Verloc has quite taken
Stevie up.

55:49.092 --> 55:51.011
Stevie!

55:51.012 --> 55:52.064
They're in Kent together.

55:54.044 --> 55:57.027
I've a weapon deadlier than
any gun...

55:57.028 --> 55:59.035
The Professor's on an omnibus.

55:59.036 --> 56:01.071
Get a message sent -
he's not to be approached.

56:01.072 --> 56:02.999
This is very kind of you.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
Betrayal...hidden in a satchel.

56:08.024 --> 56:11.019
He's a suspect, sir.
And Verloc was there with him.

56:11.020 --> 56:13.095
You're an agent, aren't you?
You're a spy.

56:13.096 --> 56:15.035
I can't just go.

56:15.036 --> 56:16.071
Who's stopping you?

56:16.072 --> 56:19.051
Despite what you said,
my marriage is real, Mother.

56:19.052 --> 56:22.043
And despite what you thought,
we are a true family.

56:22.044 --> 56:26.016
HEAT: You got your wish. It's
more than mere bricks falling down.
