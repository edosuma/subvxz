00:48.440 --> 00:49.510
That man - you.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.390
You, step away.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.430
MAN YELLS

00:52.440 --> 00:54.240
You want to steal from De Graal?

00:57.200 --> 00:58.960
You will never steal more!

01:00.080 --> 01:01.190
Arrghh!

01:01.200 --> 01:02.720
Back to work! Back to work!

01:07.520 --> 01:09.600
MAN PLEADS IN OWN LANGUAGE

01:14.080 --> 01:15.110
You see that?

01:15.120 --> 01:18.480
The black bastard's hand
just came apart!

01:23.640 --> 01:25.240
HE GULPS

01:27.040 --> 01:28.120
HE GASPS

01:38.200 --> 01:40.240
SHIP'S HORN BLARES

01:45.120 --> 01:47.200
Are you the lady
lives beneath the name Hart?

01:51.880 --> 01:54.510
I am. May I know your name, sir?

01:54.520 --> 01:58.030
Oh - you take men's names
in such places?

01:58.040 --> 02:00.160
Ones I do not quite trust, yes.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.670
There's a countryman
I hoped to find here.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.480
He lives beneath the name Jackson,
I understand.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.590
I know him.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.840
And I hope never to see him again.

02:16.080 --> 02:17.240
Forgive me, ma'am.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.400
Then where might I seek him out?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.110
Sir.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.350
Mr...?

02:25.360 --> 02:26.400
Judge.

02:27.560 --> 02:31.920
There a...surgeon works here?
An American?

02:32.920 --> 02:33.960
Daniel?

02:35.880 --> 02:37.000
Twinkle?

02:38.640 --> 02:41.710
You are a sight for a weary man.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.390
Oh! Ah!

02:44.400 --> 02:46.430
I thought you were dead,
you son of a bitch.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.070
Twink...really...

02:49.080 --> 02:51.800
Is that any way
to greet your brother?

04:18.320 --> 04:19.360
Rose?

04:21.040 --> 04:22.550
Mr Reid.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.150
What do you do here, Rose?

04:24.160 --> 04:26.350
I search for Bennet Drake, Inspector.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.670
There's twice, sir,
I owe my life to him.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.230
I walk this way twice a day

04:31.240 --> 04:33.430
and will stop only
once I have found him.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.950
I cannot forsake him.

04:34.960 --> 04:38.480
You and I are joined in that, Rose.
Here...to help...

04:40.440 --> 04:42.000
..with your enquiries.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.510
Thank you, Mr Reid.
I shall return it.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.160
You return it to him.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.120
Edmund?

05:03.040 --> 05:04.470
Chief Inspector - I am glad to find

05:04.480 --> 05:06.880
your housebreaking skills
have not gone neglected.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.310
You are here for why?

05:09.320 --> 05:10.750
It has been a month

05:10.760 --> 05:15.630
since...Sergeant Drake
handed you his badge

05:15.640 --> 05:17.510
and went missing.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.510
He will return or...he will not.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.920
But you...

05:25.760 --> 05:26.800
..my friend...

05:29.040 --> 05:32.310
..you are to extract
your head from your arse

05:32.320 --> 05:34.680
and get about your work once more.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.040
Mm - mmmm!

05:43.720 --> 05:44.910
Wherever it is you've been,

05:44.920 --> 05:46.640
you still haven't learned
any manners.

05:52.560 --> 05:57.510
Hm - get some more wine, will you?
Daniel, where have you been?

05:57.520 --> 06:01.350
Last I heard, you were in Cairo.
You wrote me.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.470
And then I wasn't.
And didn't write you.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.760
For eight years.
What are you, our mother?

06:08.880 --> 06:11.750
"Gas and lighting", you said.
"Come", you said.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.590
"Egyptians knew nothing
about everything

06:13.600 --> 06:17.150
"and have coin to spend on a man
with experience of a modern city."

06:17.160 --> 06:18.390
Which was true.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.990
But you know nothing
of either gas nor lighting.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.990
They didn't know that.
I was American.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.950
They heard my voice
and assumed I was Edison.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.270
JUDGE CHUCKLES

06:28.280 --> 06:32.510
And then?
Mm, steamer to Lake Victoria.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.720
Over land to Mombasa.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.480
Mombasa to Sofala.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.120
And Sofala to...Courtvale.

06:45.760 --> 06:49.960
And what do you do there?
Did you dig yourself a mine, Daniel?

06:51.520 --> 06:56.560
You getting this?
Twink, you are an angel.

06:58.680 --> 06:59.880
To work then.

07:03.440 --> 07:04.710
Sergeant.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.040
Mr Reid.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.360
Still no sign nor word?
No, none. Today's roll?

07:12.920 --> 07:17.070
Assaults, pockets lifted,
quiet day thus far.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.550
No deaths reported -
accidental or otherwise?

07:19.560 --> 07:22.150
None, sir.
Then that is at least something.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.750
Here. These men - surveyors.
There's three of them.

07:24.760 --> 07:27.030
Set upon by thugs
in the noonday sun.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.150
Basin Slum.
They're council surveyors.

07:29.160 --> 07:30.470
Who reported this offence?

07:30.480 --> 07:33.520
Councillor Cobden, sir.
They were her men, I believe.

07:34.920 --> 07:37.640
This man. Hinchcliffe.
Craftsman, Mr Reid.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.510
I know that, Constable.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.350
The man made my wife's wedding band.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.190
His complaint? That he is defrauded.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.870
You met with him? Yes, sir.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.990
Flight,
would you consider it an intrusion

07:49.000 --> 07:50.240
if I spoke with him myself?

07:51.960 --> 07:53.230
Not at all, Inspector.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.870
In fact, I should be grateful
for your insight.

07:55.880 --> 07:59.510
Sergeant, I am to Hinchcliffe
and thence to Councillor Cobden.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.880
Yes, Mr Reid.
With me, Flight.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.230
Mr Werner and I -

08:07.240 --> 08:09.870
commerce had been established
for a little over six months.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.030
Thank you.
No, thanks.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.950
A necklace one week,
a watch strap the next month,

08:14.960 --> 08:16.000
a bracelet or two.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.790
Payment was prompt
on each and every occasion...

08:19.800 --> 08:22.750
And then the final order was made
by Werner himself.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.870
Indeed, I could see no reason
to distrust him.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.070
It was a substantial order.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.470
Two necklaces set with rubies,
three brooches likewise.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.600
Earrings...

08:33.880 --> 08:35.080
Such an opportunity.

08:37.039 --> 08:39.309
I could have fed my family
for half a year.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.630
Mr Hinchcliffe,
such men as this Werner

08:41.640 --> 08:43.110
are wise in their deception.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.280
There is no shame
in your trust of him.

08:46.480 --> 08:51.110
But the loan I took on
to manufacture those goods

08:51.120 --> 08:52.510
its repayment...

08:52.520 --> 08:55.640
If this man is not found,
my goods recovered and sold...

08:57.480 --> 08:59.150
..then my family
is for the workhouse.

08:59.160 --> 09:03.040
We will find him.
Sir, restitution will be made.

09:04.520 --> 09:09.870
This quarter, Flight,
all that we see here, daily -

09:09.880 --> 09:12.630
abduction, murder -

09:12.640 --> 09:15.670
it is perhaps understandable
that crimes like these

09:15.680 --> 09:17.990
do often go unreported

09:18.000 --> 09:19.910
and that they are treated
by ourselves

09:19.920 --> 09:23.190
as not mattering a great deal
in comparison.

09:23.200 --> 09:26.750
But honest trade practised
with skill and good heart

09:26.760 --> 09:27.950
and now cheated of income?

09:27.960 --> 09:31.030
For this neighbourhood
to emerge from the swamp,

09:31.040 --> 09:32.390
the Hinchcliffes of our world

09:32.400 --> 09:34.870
must feel our support
and encouragement.

09:34.880 --> 09:38.360
You have it, Flight. It all matters.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.320
You find this man Werner for me.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.560
It is a complaint of common assault,
Inspector.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.310
A bobby with a notebook
would have been quite adequate.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.950
If not, in fact, preferable.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.390
There was an opportunity to see you
and I...took it.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.950
And no such similar opportunity
presented itself

09:58.960 --> 10:01.550
in the month since you last stood
in that doorway

10:01.560 --> 10:03.870
and professed that what you felt
for me was love?

10:03.880 --> 10:05.920
Much has happened since that night.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.560
My, er...my sergeant.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.400
His wife was taken from him.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.710
I do hope that you will
pass my sympathies.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.480
I cannot find him, Jane.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.230
I believe he holds himself
responsible for it.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.070
And was he? No.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.280
But such guilt...

10:27.680 --> 10:29.000
..it is not unfamiliar to him.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.480
Nor to myself.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.280
I try to understand, Edmund.
I do. But...

10:38.160 --> 10:40.110
Almost five weeks to sit alone

10:40.120 --> 10:42.440
in the confusion of knowing
that you...

10:44.840 --> 10:46.870
What is it here that frightens you
so much?

10:46.880 --> 10:50.150
That in seeking to make you happier
than you were before,

10:50.160 --> 10:51.870
I might, in fact, do the reverse.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.880
I am afraid that's already
been achieved.

10:56.040 --> 11:00.150
But, Edmund, it is within your power
to remedy it.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.790
Well...let me begin, at least,
by helping you with this matter

11:03.800 --> 11:06.720
of the assaults on your men
at St Paul's Wharfside.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.480
Now I have you.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.870
I believe I've found him, Sergeant.
Who's that, Mr Flight?

11:23.880 --> 11:25.590
The confidence man - Werner.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.550
He is accused of defrauding
Mr Hinchcliffe.

11:28.560 --> 11:32.190
Every year, five similar swindles
on five similar tradesmen -

11:32.200 --> 11:34.030
smiths, furniture makers, tailors.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.910
Then within a week,
a flash-sale advertised,

11:36.920 --> 11:39.470
the belongings of bankrupt
businesses and properties.

11:39.480 --> 11:43.070
There is one such "sale"
begins this very morning, Sergeant.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.120
Well...

11:45.920 --> 11:48.280
..then you best go shopping,
Mr Flight.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.320
I seek a man called Werner.

11:58.920 --> 11:59.960
Two shillings?

12:04.920 --> 12:06.670
You are Werner?

12:06.680 --> 12:08.000
What is it you want, boy?

12:09.120 --> 12:10.200
A frock to step out in?

12:11.400 --> 12:12.440
H Division.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.400
Stop him!

12:31.000 --> 12:32.040
H Division, is it?

12:33.440 --> 12:34.600
Well...

12:36.800 --> 12:38.360
..you're in Limehouse now.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.760
And I...am protected.

12:44.320 --> 12:47.240
Yes. That's right, Daphne.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.070
You know who runs things
around here.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.520
The name "Shine" familiar to you,
is it?

13:16.280 --> 13:20.430
But guilt and penalty of sin
may be removed, may they not,

13:20.440 --> 13:22.080
through good deeds?

13:23.320 --> 13:26.990
You strive to perform God's will
in your work?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.110
I do, Father.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.240
What is it you want, my son?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.040
To be a good man.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.200
MAN GRUNTS IN PAIN

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Come on - get upstanding, Perkins.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.680
Barton, water. Yes, sir.

13:54.360 --> 13:57.560
Inspector Shine -
I would speak with you, sir?

13:58.600 --> 14:03.790
Well now, Constable Flight -
how I've missed ya, my boy.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.670
My cuckoo in another man's nest.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.800
What word from Leeman Street?

14:09.120 --> 14:10.550
Come here.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.150
I am set to apprehend
a man named Werner,

14:13.160 --> 14:14.550
but now find I cannot do so

14:14.560 --> 14:17.070
for the fact he pays you
his protection.

14:17.080 --> 14:21.190
You are not to get yourself
flustered, Detective Constable.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.790
Mr Werner can be careless.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.430
And you are guilty of nothing

14:24.440 --> 14:26.830
but performing the duties
with which you are entrusted.

14:26.840 --> 14:30.870
Forgive me, but that is not...quite
accurate now, is it?

14:30.880 --> 14:32.270
What's this?

14:32.280 --> 14:34.440
Do you now succumb to introspection?

14:36.640 --> 14:38.830
Do not forget what you were
when I first found you -

14:38.840 --> 14:42.110
a little Paddy wretch
destined for jail or an early grave.

14:42.120 --> 14:45.760
And now look at you -
quite the CID swell.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.190
So perhaps the estimable Reid

14:54.200 --> 14:57.350
does not consider you quite
as efficacious in your crime-solving

14:57.360 --> 14:58.390
as he might wish.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.440
But that is not the prime purpose
that finds you by his side, is it?

15:02.480 --> 15:04.150
Is it, Flight? No, sir.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.390
Then what is?

15:05.400 --> 15:08.840
To forewarn you...should his gaze
fall in your direction.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.480
Great. Good boy.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.320
You're a week late
with your payments, madam.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.720
I know this.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.600
The man I regret I must call
husband has squandered it.

15:28.240 --> 15:29.760
Are matters rectified?

15:31.640 --> 15:33.430
They are not.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.560
And you recall
the terms of our agreement?

15:37.200 --> 15:38.360
I do.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.440
Girls!

15:45.640 --> 15:47.590
And before we commence
such discussions,

15:47.600 --> 15:50.630
I thought you might enjoy a little
of what we have built here.

15:50.640 --> 15:53.070
On the house, of course.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.040
You mean on MY house, do you not?

15:56.400 --> 15:57.440
I do.

16:10.680 --> 16:11.720
Send them away.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.200
Leave us, girls.

16:20.840 --> 16:23.640
Perhaps it is early. No.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.120
They are early in years.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.750
It is not a girl I want, madam.
It's a woman.

16:30.760 --> 16:34.630
After all, there is an additional
clause in our contract.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.390
It is not too much to ask, is it,

16:37.400 --> 16:40.310
when your handing to me
but one night of pleasure

16:40.320 --> 16:42.950
might in return hand you
your freedom?

16:42.960 --> 16:44.870

16:44.880 --> 16:46.000
Come.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.830

16:49.840 --> 16:52.440
we are asked
which is the best room for them.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.990
Why so startled, Madam?
After all, it is my house.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.040
Now, where would you suggest?

Of course.

And did it...

18:43.880 --> 18:45.240
Were you changed by it?

18:47.120 --> 18:48.710
Well, changed how, Miss?

18:48.720 --> 18:49.920
Inside yourself.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.870
When you were then
with another man -

18:53.880 --> 18:57.040
a...a man you loved, for example.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.470
Miss Susan,
I have never known what it is

19:03.480 --> 19:05.040
to lie with a man I love.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.990
Oh, hail the conquering hero.
What's this, Constable?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
You do not have your man in irons?

19:23.240 --> 19:27.430
I believed I had found him, sir,
but...I had not.

19:27.440 --> 19:30.430
This confidence man named Werner.
He defrauds men of jewellery.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.280
Good jewellery. Keep at it, Flight.
Yes, sir.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.190
Evening, girls.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.710
How do, Rosie?

20:01.720 --> 20:05.160
Late for a girl like you -
unless you want to get in line.

20:06.840 --> 20:10.230
What's this, Rose?
Still hunting for your beau, are ya?

20:10.240 --> 20:14.670
He ain't my beau, Gracie.
But I look for him all right.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.190
Here, look. I've got a picture now.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.430
Have you seen him? I seen him.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.230
Where, Gracie?

20:21.240 --> 20:23.430
Nowhere you want to go, girl.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.510
Please.

20:24.520 --> 20:28.520
Look, I'll pay whatever you need
to get you off the street tonight.

21:24.160 --> 21:27.430
CROWD SHOUTS SUGGESTIONS

21:27.440 --> 21:29.910
An healthy variation in opinion.

of this man's pain!

21:54.600 --> 21:55.840
Break his jaw!

22:16.880 --> 22:20.070
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

That is 13, gentlemen, 13.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.000
No man has wagered more.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.750
This book is closed.

22:29.760 --> 22:33.280
And this house shall not be
paying out tonight!

22:42.880 --> 22:43.920
Bennet?

22:48.720 --> 22:49.760
Oh, Bennet.

22:52.280 --> 22:53.840
What have you done to yourself?

22:57.560 --> 23:01.000
Ah! Ow! Bennet!

23:13.640 --> 23:18.030
You abandoned that cat house
and that woman

23:18.040 --> 23:19.350
to come live here?

23:19.360 --> 23:22.110
Who's to say it was me
left the place?

23:22.120 --> 23:25.390
Sorry, Twink, I just thought
that...I'm the type to up and leave

23:25.400 --> 23:28.390
and that, most like, you were also.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.240
Yeah? Well, don't think.

23:31.920 --> 23:32.960
Jesus.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.800
What did you do?
Doesn't matter. Don't ask.

23:38.080 --> 23:41.270
Yeah...probably for the best.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.200
You'd have quit her,
one day or the next.

23:45.360 --> 23:48.550
This way, you got no guilt.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.990
And you get to feel wronged.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.230
JUDGE LAUGHS

23:53.240 --> 23:55.150
That must be good.
Stop it, Daniel.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.070
Stop what?
The kinship routine.

23:57.080 --> 23:58.510
But we are kin, Twink.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.870
In blood, regrettably,

23:59.880 --> 24:03.230
but me and you...we ain't even
close to alike.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.830
Where were you born?
I'm not playing, Daniel.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.590
"Why, Richmond, Virginia."

24:09.600 --> 24:13.990
Well, now blow me down. So was I.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.520
When did you leave?
"Soon as I could."

24:18.800 --> 24:20.510
Myself likewise.

24:20.520 --> 24:23.270
Where did you go?

24:23.280 --> 24:26.790
"Far as I could.
So long as it weren't home."

24:26.800 --> 24:30.720
Your father was a doctor?
Mine the same.

24:32.080 --> 24:33.240
Well, what befell him?

24:34.560 --> 24:37.790
"The torpor of his life
got the better of him,

24:37.800 --> 24:39.390
"until one night suppertime,

24:39.400 --> 24:43.360
"he opened his jugular
over the Sunday meatloaf."

24:45.480 --> 24:47.030
Rrrggghhh!

24:47.040 --> 24:49.960
GRUNTING AND GROANING

24:52.280 --> 24:53.520
Jackson! Hey!

25:01.600 --> 25:03.040
That's our host, Daniel.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.320
You play nice, now.
You're Reid?

25:09.960 --> 25:11.360
Why did you not say?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.160
"Twink"?

25:28.400 --> 25:30.150
Twinkle.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.510
On account of
his cheerful disposition.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.640
Ah.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.950
Well...good night, Mr Judge.

25:39.960 --> 25:41.000
Hmm.

25:45.600 --> 25:49.520
I do hope our city
will not detain you long.

25:59.600 --> 26:03.600
Sarcasm, Daniel -
it means he hopes you leave soon.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.440
JUDGE SNORES

26:59.440 --> 27:01.270
BLADE RINGS

27:01.280 --> 27:03.120
You put that back, Twinkle.

27:04.320 --> 27:09.360
Or blood or no blood,
I will slit you.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.360
So are you going
to show me what it is?

27:25.080 --> 27:29.310
35 carat diamond in the rough.

27:29.320 --> 27:31.190
You think De Graal won't miss that?

27:31.200 --> 27:33.790
6,000 miles, Cape Town to London.

27:33.800 --> 27:36.670
But they established
a syndicate here.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.510
The diamond merchants of London
are given stock for their loyalty.

27:39.520 --> 27:41.870
You march down to Hatton Garden
to sell that,

27:41.880 --> 27:43.680
well...they're going to kill you.

27:46.080 --> 27:49.200
I did not come visiting
on my little brother to get dead.

27:51.440 --> 27:52.480
I need a crook, then.

27:53.520 --> 27:55.120
Well, there, I can help you.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.390
I work for the police, remember.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.920
And Daniel, if this gets sold
and cleaned thanks to me...

28:02.200 --> 28:03.240
..I'm taking half.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.430
And you can guarantee
that when I return this evening,

28:10.440 --> 28:12.350
my silverware will be intact?

28:12.360 --> 28:15.030
He's my brother, Reid.
What am I supposed to do?

28:15.040 --> 28:16.320
Get rid of him?

28:36.360 --> 28:37.400
Evening, Flight.

28:40.160 --> 28:41.960
This guy, Werner? What of him?

28:44.960 --> 28:46.870
Look, my dead room lacks
for residents,

28:46.880 --> 28:48.190
I have some time on my hands,

28:48.200 --> 28:49.790
why not talk me through
what you got?

28:49.800 --> 28:51.480
I could help you, Constable.

29:01.120 --> 29:03.510
Did you try this place Finkels, yet?

29:03.520 --> 29:07.480
I have. Werner has not sold
there for three years now.

29:18.960 --> 29:22.310
Excuse me, darlin', but if you saw
the pox he carried, you'd thank me.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.400
Oh, no!

29:27.120 --> 29:28.670
I may have something.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.200
Someone.

29:31.800 --> 29:35.750
The station is investigating
a man named Werner.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.510
Long firm man.

29:37.520 --> 29:41.070
Has in the past sold goods to
a jeweller named Finkel.

29:41.080 --> 29:45.910
And this Finkel...he does
not deal with this syndicate?

29:45.920 --> 29:48.920
Who's to say?
But he does deal with criminals.

29:52.160 --> 29:54.960
It's all we have, Daniel.

30:00.200 --> 30:03.750
You believe your share of this will
allow for your return to your wife?

30:03.760 --> 30:04.990
It cannot but help.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.560
You think it the only reason
she cast you out?

30:09.800 --> 30:11.350
It's not.

30:11.360 --> 30:14.070
It is never.
What do you know about it?

30:14.080 --> 30:16.750
You have some happy
hearthside waiting for you

30:16.760 --> 30:18.480
when you get done with this?

30:19.760 --> 30:21.280
Yeah, I didn't think so.

30:22.840 --> 30:25.190
Listen to me...

30:25.200 --> 30:30.070
I got rich and I got poor again,

30:30.080 --> 30:33.560
but the same smell
still followed me.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.990
This Finkel comes to fruition -
you'll have your half.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.720
But don't go thinking that Judge
stink leaves you, Twink.

30:42.680 --> 30:44.520
It don't.

31:03.840 --> 31:06.510
This is Wainwright? Yes, sir.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.030
He progresses?

31:08.040 --> 31:10.910
He does. Quarterfinals now, sir.

31:10.920 --> 31:13.390
Our challenger for the Lafone Cup.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.950
He's a good fighter?

31:15.960 --> 31:20.030
He is no Bennet Drake, sir.
But he improves.

31:20.040 --> 31:24.790
Flight? Your pursuit of this
Werner? What progress?

31:24.800 --> 31:27.030
I hunt him, sir. I do so now.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.640
Well, go to it, then.

31:33.480 --> 31:36.030
Although one assumes
the identity of this year's

31:36.040 --> 31:37.590
victor as certain as ever.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.320
Quite so, Mr Reid.

31:42.800 --> 31:46.070
Keep your back straight!

31:46.080 --> 31:50.470
Five acres, in which reside
6,000 individuals,

31:50.480 --> 31:52.670
and the rate at which they die here

31:52.680 --> 31:56.150
is four times that of
the rest of this city.

31:56.160 --> 32:00.830
As you know, I plan to replace these
shanties with modern and sanitary

32:00.840 --> 32:05.510
dwellings in which people might live
out of choice, not obligation.

32:05.520 --> 32:09.070
However, this I cannot do
unless the party, or parties,

32:09.080 --> 32:11.670
that own these lands permit it.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.870
Currently, all our surveyors
encounter is violence

32:14.880 --> 32:16.470
from hired thugs.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.550
It is for this reason,
ladies and gentlemen,

32:18.560 --> 32:22.110
that I invite you here today
to urge you, in print,

32:22.120 --> 32:27.030
to shame these opaque and hidden
powers into good faith negotiation.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.710
To ask them to stand forward

32:29.720 --> 32:32.760
and have a care for the
future lives of their tenants.

32:35.160 --> 32:37.270
I thank you.

32:37.280 --> 32:39.150
APPLAUSE

32:39.160 --> 32:41.590
Councillor. The investigations
I have made for you.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.830
You wish to cause men shame,
it's better for you

32:43.840 --> 32:46.950
to have a name with which
to do so - Obsidian Estates.

32:46.960 --> 32:49.990
The rest I leave to you
and whichever of these muckrakes

32:50.000 --> 32:51.630
you can bring to your side.

32:51.640 --> 32:54.230
What's this, Inspector? What's this?

32:54.240 --> 32:57.910
A man of your many occupations
suddenly diverted by paperwork?

32:57.920 --> 33:00.230
Miss Cobden has a hope that less
people might die here

33:00.240 --> 33:01.630
than is currently the case.

33:01.640 --> 33:04.670
That hope is shared by the police -
if not by yourself.

33:04.680 --> 33:07.200
Councillor. Inspector.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.630
He is a man of noble intent,
our Inspector Reid.

33:14.640 --> 33:17.160
Do you not find, Miss Cobden?

33:29.520 --> 33:31.350
Sir. You are Finkel?

33:31.360 --> 33:33.950
Is there anything in particular
for which you search?

33:33.960 --> 33:36.520
Not so much a thing...as a man.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.640
Man called Werner.

33:43.920 --> 33:45.560
You are American.

33:47.160 --> 33:54.350
I've spent the last five or
six years in Africa, however.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.590
The South of Africa -

33:56.600 --> 33:59.790
part of the world that
the British now call their own.

33:59.800 --> 34:05.470
Big hole in the ground that
has come to be named Courtvale.

34:05.480 --> 34:08.270
Well, you must have
seen many things there,

34:08.280 --> 34:12.150
many stories to bring with you.

34:12.159 --> 34:17.949
Hmm. Some other belongings, perhaps.

34:17.960 --> 34:25.320
Belongings this man Werner, whom you
seek, might indeed assist you with?

34:29.480 --> 34:30.840
Size?

34:36.360 --> 34:38.560
It is on your person?

34:41.280 --> 34:44.310
And should Mr Werner
wish to find you - find you

34:44.320 --> 34:48.800
and perhaps view this item -
there is an address?

35:02.680 --> 35:04.200
Thank you for your time.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.560
He asked for you by name. I heard.

35:31.600 --> 35:34.390
Police, you think? He was American.

35:34.400 --> 35:38.270
Well, that ain't no impediment
these days, I can tell you.

35:38.280 --> 35:41.470
However, he does have
a stone he hopes you might acquire.

35:41.480 --> 35:44.720
A large one. But stolen, I imagine.

35:46.120 --> 35:50.150
Not in the current mood. No.

35:50.160 --> 35:53.470
We do our duty by our masters

35:53.480 --> 35:56.080
and we inform the syndicate.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.510
This one searches for you.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.270
Mr Hinchcliffe.

36:03.280 --> 36:04.630
Detective Flight.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.110
Sir.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.190
Please...I have found him.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.390
The fraudster Werner.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.470
Seen him, in fact.

36:12.480 --> 36:14.320
He is at Hatton Garden.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.920
Will you not come?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.800
Er, yes, sorry, of course...

36:31.160 --> 36:33.800
Please. Five minutes, sir.

36:53.160 --> 36:54.630
Mr Hinchcliffe.

36:54.640 --> 36:57.470
Thanks for your urgent attention,
Mr Flight.

36:57.480 --> 37:01.800
Not at all. We must hope
we find him there, still.

37:08.520 --> 37:09.880
This is it, Detective.

37:21.480 --> 37:22.870
H Division.

37:22.880 --> 37:26.070
Then you have
yourself lost, friend.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.790
Do you see the article, sir?
There, Detective.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.240
My stolen earrings!

37:34.320 --> 37:37.480
HE CHOKES

37:49.880 --> 37:51.960
You do not give me those eyes.

37:53.480 --> 37:57.400
You have been well safeguarded
from the realities of your position.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.120
This is your life.

38:05.960 --> 38:07.640
Werner!

38:11.480 --> 38:14.120
And you, sir, you fetch a mop.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.880
Mr Shine, you have
lost your reasoning.

38:27.880 --> 38:29.750
You wish this lad to
put me in irons

38:29.760 --> 38:32.120
and fetch me to his Leman Street
masters.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.190
Now come here.

38:36.200 --> 38:38.670
HE CHUCKLES

38:38.680 --> 38:40.440
You old kike!

38:41.520 --> 38:44.190
You see, this lad here has been seen
leaving in the company

38:44.200 --> 38:47.270
of this ex-gentleman here.

38:47.280 --> 38:51.750
He returns to the Leman Street
fold without neither of you,

38:51.760 --> 38:53.750
and questions get asked.

38:53.760 --> 38:56.270
Que... Questions is going
to get asked any which way.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.630
Indeed. But you will
be there to answer them.

38:58.640 --> 39:01.630
"No, Mr Reid, I have never met
a man named Hinchcliffe.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.950
"No, sir, I know nothing
of no jewellery order."

39:03.960 --> 39:07.350
Who will there be to say otherwise?

39:07.360 --> 39:10.590
In due course there will be nothing
for it but to show you the door.

39:10.600 --> 39:14.750
Well, what about their other
methods of questioning a man?

39:14.760 --> 39:16.990
His station house's
reputation for violence

39:17.000 --> 39:19.150
walks ahead of his inspector.

39:19.160 --> 39:21.390
They will torture me, Mr Shine.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.920
Give me your hand,
give me your hand...

39:26.000 --> 39:29.910
Mr Reid has no
stomach for such acts...

39:29.920 --> 39:32.470
relies instead on another
man's brutality.

39:32.480 --> 39:36.590
And that man -
the good Sergeant Drake -

39:36.600 --> 39:38.400
is no more for that beat.

39:40.920 --> 39:45.030
So you and the lad
let yourselves out.

39:45.040 --> 39:46.520
Sharp like.

39:53.080 --> 39:57.120
MEN COUGH AND SPLUTTER

40:27.880 --> 40:30.670
Begging your pardon, sir. Yes, miss?

40:30.680 --> 40:33.830
Why is it you men
dig so big a grave?

40:33.840 --> 40:37.070
Many bodies are to be
buried in it, miss.

40:37.080 --> 40:39.760
The beggared and
nameless dead of this parish.

40:46.800 --> 40:49.630
Sergeant Artherton,
no loss of life as yet?

40:49.640 --> 40:51.360
None, sir.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.430
The man, Werner, sir.

40:57.440 --> 40:58.960
And so?

41:00.160 --> 41:02.360
Denies it all. As one expects.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.870
Good work, Flight.

41:05.880 --> 41:09.030
Sergeant Artherton, have this
man booked and locked down.

41:09.040 --> 41:10.990
Now, where is Mr Hinchcliffe?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.430
He's away home, sir,
to pass the news to his wife.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.630
You are aware, are you not,
Flight, that he

41:15.640 --> 41:18.430
must make formal identification?
I am, sir, but he was insistent.

41:18.440 --> 41:20.350
Well, you go, fetch him to me now.

41:20.360 --> 41:21.640
Yes, sir.

41:53.440 --> 41:57.040
You have no wish to speak
with me, Bennet...

41:59.120 --> 42:00.640
I see that.

42:03.240 --> 42:08.230
But I will not be diverted
now that I have found you,

42:08.240 --> 42:10.200
because I am your true friend.

42:14.200 --> 42:18.600
I know that I have been
cruel to you in the past.

42:21.440 --> 42:25.400
And you must look at me now and see
nothing but a reminder of your pain.

42:27.240 --> 42:30.070
But I am your friend

42:30.080 --> 42:32.280
and I will not desert you.

42:33.560 --> 42:37.230
So you go back to your graves
and your dosshouses,

42:37.240 --> 42:39.750
and you be sure of this...

42:39.760 --> 42:43.990
As the day begins
and the night ends,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.910
you will find me waiting for you.

42:46.920 --> 42:49.950
You think you can hide from life

42:49.960 --> 42:53.350
and perhaps another man might...

42:53.360 --> 42:56.790
but not a man such as you,
Bennet Drake.

42:56.800 --> 42:59.390
You believe yourself are cursed -

42:59.400 --> 43:01.630
you are not.

43:01.640 --> 43:04.590
You believe you carry only pain
into other people's lives -

43:04.600 --> 43:06.390
you do not.

43:06.400 --> 43:09.630
Bennet, you brought love into mine.

43:09.640 --> 43:13.160
A love that is keener
now than ever it was.

43:15.160 --> 43:18.790
You are a good man.
You are a good man.

43:18.800 --> 43:21.750
I will say those words
until the day I die.

43:21.760 --> 43:26.030
Bennet Drake is the
best of men and this life,

43:26.040 --> 43:30.360
this world, will not let
him sink from its surface.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.720
Miss Hart, please.

44:47.480 --> 44:49.590
Mr Judge.

44:49.600 --> 44:51.870
Mr Daniel Judge.

44:51.880 --> 44:56.200
COCKNEY ACCENT: Who?
I ain't ever 'eard of no Judge.

44:58.520 --> 44:59.830
Please, sir.

44:59.840 --> 45:01.910
You cannot bring a diamond
here without that the

45:01.920 --> 45:03.870
house of De Graal
discovers that act.

45:03.880 --> 45:06.830
We know who you are,
where you have been.

45:06.840 --> 45:12.790
And now - thanks to our friend
and associate Mr Finkel -

45:12.800 --> 45:16.030
we know where you currently reside.

45:16.040 --> 45:20.040
The house of De Graal knows all
and everything about you, sir.

45:29.720 --> 45:31.750
Are you not pleased?

45:31.760 --> 45:33.320
The wine is German.

45:36.520 --> 45:38.430
And so I say again...

45:38.440 --> 45:40.120
are you not pleased?

45:41.400 --> 45:42.990
I am not.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.080
And I believe this
fact known to you.

45:48.840 --> 45:50.750
My house is no longer my own.

45:50.760 --> 45:53.670
Your life is no longer
your own, madam.

45:53.680 --> 45:56.470
And yet you know what will
make my presence here

45:56.480 --> 45:58.040
be a thing of the past.

46:00.880 --> 46:04.000
Duggan...I cannot.

46:06.200 --> 46:08.390
Miss Hart,

46:08.400 --> 46:12.830
you allow other women to perform
an act from which you profit.

46:12.840 --> 46:15.800
Yet you baulk at performing
it yourself! Please!

46:17.480 --> 46:18.800
I cannot.

46:28.480 --> 46:30.390
Duggan, what are you doing?

46:30.400 --> 46:32.070
Long Susan.

46:32.080 --> 46:33.630
Why is it they call you so?

46:33.640 --> 46:35.910
Because look -

46:35.920 --> 46:37.920
you are no bigger than a pepper pot.

46:39.160 --> 46:41.070
But let me be clear.

46:41.080 --> 46:43.030
You do not oblige me.

46:43.040 --> 46:47.590
Myself, my men
are the future for this house

46:47.600 --> 46:48.990
because I have it in mind,

46:49.000 --> 46:51.870
that your ladies do not work as hard
as others in their profession.

46:51.880 --> 46:54.350
This house's profits
might be greater

46:54.360 --> 46:59.230
and so I shall see to it they are
never, never off their backs.

46:59.240 --> 47:01.070
And it will not be gentlemen.

47:01.080 --> 47:03.230
Oh, no, it will be navvies

47:03.240 --> 47:07.430
and dockers and soldiers
and they will be in and out so fast

47:07.440 --> 47:10.470
I shall install baffle gates
to the doors.

47:10.480 --> 47:14.680
Terrible things, madam, which only
you have the power to prevent.

47:15.760 --> 47:18.480
Think hard on my terms, madam,
think hard.

47:19.560 --> 47:23.150
And do not preoccupy yourself
with thoughts of escape,

47:23.160 --> 47:27.360
because for a prize such as you,
sweet Susan...

47:28.840 --> 47:30.920
..I will pursue that
to the end of time.

47:47.840 --> 47:49.240
Flight?

47:51.800 --> 47:53.640
What of Hinchcliffe?

47:55.680 --> 47:57.190
I cannot find him, sir.

47:57.200 --> 48:00.280
You have spoken to his family?
Left word for him? I have, sir.

48:02.480 --> 48:05.400
Until he returns, we must deal
with Mr Werner ourselves.

48:14.520 --> 48:16.760
How is it we have not met before,
Mr Werner?

48:19.360 --> 48:22.040
Perhaps because I am an honest man,
Inspector.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.440
Nathaniel Hinchcliffe.

48:26.440 --> 48:27.870
I have never heard that name.

48:27.880 --> 48:29.470
He knows you, sir.

48:29.480 --> 48:31.750
Does he, now?

48:31.760 --> 48:32.830
I say he does not.

48:32.840 --> 48:36.310
You established trade and trust
and then you defrauded him.

48:36.320 --> 48:39.560
Then you bring him here and
let me deny it to his face.

48:40.800 --> 48:43.470
Deny it all you wish,
I know it for truth.

48:43.480 --> 48:46.270
Well, I have heard it said

48:46.280 --> 48:48.800
that you are a man for
fantasies, Inspector.

48:51.480 --> 48:54.200
And that the power behind your
threats is now gone from you.

49:02.760 --> 49:05.710
Is that all the questioning
you may muster?

49:05.720 --> 49:07.920
Am I now to be released?
No, you are not!

49:13.040 --> 49:15.200
WERNER GROANS

49:18.560 --> 49:19.960
You policeman...

49:21.560 --> 49:24.030
..animals, to the last man.

49:24.040 --> 49:26.800
HE GROANS

49:30.840 --> 49:33.640
As I say, animals.

49:40.360 --> 49:42.950
It is almost three days and still

49:42.960 --> 49:45.110
there are no deaths
reported in Whitechapel.

49:45.120 --> 49:46.880
This does not give me cause for joy.

49:48.040 --> 49:50.200
It gives me cause
for grave foreboding.

49:51.280 --> 49:53.750
There is evil afoot, Flight,

49:53.760 --> 49:56.080
and I cannot determine
from where it springs.

50:02.280 --> 50:04.400
I need Drake.

50:07.560 --> 50:10.800
CROWD BAYS

50:16.880 --> 50:19.160
CROWD: Smash him!

50:25.520 --> 50:27.440
Come on, then.

50:37.320 --> 50:40.240
CLATTERING AND BANGING

51:10.760 --> 51:12.630
Why do you send for me?

51:12.640 --> 51:14.630
Because I love you.

51:14.640 --> 51:17.030
Love is no use to me currently.

51:17.040 --> 51:20.430
I swear to you,
this could change everything.

51:20.440 --> 51:21.640
Please?

51:27.880 --> 51:31.160
HE COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS

51:38.680 --> 51:41.680
I... I-I swear...

51:43.200 --> 51:45.790
..on everything I hold dear.

51:45.800 --> 51:48.680
That is the problem with men
such as yourself, Mr Judge.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.160
You hold nothing dear.

51:52.200 --> 51:55.350
Apart, perhaps,
from that which you steal.

51:55.360 --> 51:57.000
Nothing upstairs, brother.

52:00.160 --> 52:03.360
HE WHIMPERS

52:28.120 --> 52:30.710
It don't look like much,
I grant you that.

52:30.720 --> 52:32.390
And it is stolen, I assume.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.640
Do you know what he says
we can get for this?

52:35.640 --> 52:38.520
Me and Daniel's share,
15,000.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.470
That's ten for Duggan.

52:41.480 --> 52:42.800
You and me...

52:44.120 --> 52:46.160
..five to then live as we please.

52:48.560 --> 52:50.310
A moment comes in a woman's life

52:50.320 --> 52:52.280
when she may no longer
deal in dreams.

52:54.120 --> 52:55.830
This?

52:55.840 --> 52:56.880
This is fantasy...

52:58.160 --> 53:00.150
..or it is death,

53:00.160 --> 53:01.600
and it might well be both.

53:06.440 --> 53:08.190
No.

53:08.200 --> 53:09.910
Captain Homer Jackson.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.360
Matthew Judge. Husband.

53:12.560 --> 53:13.640
No.

53:16.080 --> 53:18.400
I will have no more of you
and your dreams.

53:20.880 --> 53:22.440
The world is what it is.

53:24.560 --> 53:25.920
And I must live with that.

53:41.520 --> 53:43.200
You Boer half-wits.

53:44.600 --> 53:47.990
You have nothing on me.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.480
Nothing...

53:51.000 --> 53:54.400
So leave now or kill me.

53:57.840 --> 54:00.710
But if kill me you must,

54:00.720 --> 54:04.110
know that you do so

54:04.120 --> 54:09.600
in the home of an inspector
of the Metropolitan Police.

54:13.320 --> 54:15.080
KNOCK AT DOOR
Come.

54:24.080 --> 54:25.310
You work late.

54:25.320 --> 54:27.190
You know my habits?

54:27.200 --> 54:28.800
They are of a kind with mine.

54:30.240 --> 54:31.560
Why have you come here?

54:33.040 --> 54:34.720
I feel a despair in me.

54:36.200 --> 54:38.760
And the thought of you...eases it.

54:40.880 --> 54:42.240
You are hurt.

54:46.680 --> 54:48.200
A man's jaw.

54:49.480 --> 54:50.760
Why do you tell me this?

54:52.800 --> 54:54.440
Do you wish me to disapprove?

54:55.840 --> 54:57.080
No.

55:02.080 --> 55:05.510
I need you to see
my life as it is.

55:05.520 --> 55:07.520
So that I may say
that I am appalled...

55:08.680 --> 55:10.120
..or that I am afraid of you?

55:11.280 --> 55:14.230
Your work, its requirements,

55:14.240 --> 55:17.270
those are not the things
that frighten me, Edmund.

55:17.280 --> 55:20.160
What frightens me is your
existence on this Earth.

55:29.240 --> 55:32.040
HE PANTS

55:46.560 --> 55:50.440
PASSIONATE GROANING

56:08.760 --> 56:10.080
Come.

56:33.080 --> 56:36.120
THUNDER RUMBLES

56:45.320 --> 56:47.280
Only two more now, lads.

56:51.440 --> 56:53.550
Steady now, watch your step.
I said, watch it!

56:53.560 --> 56:55.360
No, you fool, look out!

56:57.880 --> 56:59.000
Get him up.

57:05.040 --> 57:07.950
Drake, you leave it where it lies.

57:07.960 --> 57:09.520
I said, leave it!

57:25.120 --> 57:27.440
Mr Reid, you must come now, sir!

57:30.880 --> 57:34.000
CROWD MURMURS

57:59.760 --> 58:01.430
REFEREE: H Division!

58:01.440 --> 58:05.190
Life, Mr Reid, is
offended by you and me.

58:05.200 --> 58:06.400
Oh, my Lord God.

58:07.720 --> 58:10.240
I am heartily sorry
for having offended you.

58:15.560 --> 58:17.270
You see... Fight him!

58:17.280 --> 58:19.480
..I cannot be ended.
