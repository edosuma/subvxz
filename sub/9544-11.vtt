00:35.430 --> 00:37.513
That, of course,
is a clip from the classic

00:37.548 --> 00:39.817
Sonny Chow film called.
Legend of the Cobra.

00:39.852 --> 00:41.307
Got to be one of my favorites.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.900
We're talking
with John Ricca.

00:42.935 --> 00:46.113
He is the author of a sensational
new book about the late,

00:46.148 --> 00:49.818
great martial arts superstar,
called Paper Cobra.

00:49.853 --> 00:52.262
I believe you're supposed to hold
the book up when you say that.

00:52.297 --> 00:54.370
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.
You know, John,

00:54.405 --> 00:56.867
- this book is very controversial.
- I hope so.

00:56.902 --> 01:00.194
And, in the book, you claim that
many of Sonny Chow's stunts,

01:00.229 --> 01:01.990
including the ones
we were just showing you,

01:02.025 --> 01:03.986
were actually performed
by stunt doubles.

01:04.021 --> 01:05.594
I don't just claim it.
I prove it.

01:05.629 --> 01:07.713
And you say that
for most of his career,

01:07.748 --> 01:09.234
Sonny Chow was addicted
to morphine.

01:09.269 --> 01:10.660
That's right.
That's what killed him.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.592
Wasn't a brain hemorrhage,
like the studio said.

01:12.627 --> 01:16.545
We've all heard these rumors, this notion
that Sonny Chow isn't actually dead.

01:16.580 --> 01:20.196
The story goes that a Hong Kong
drug cartel put a price on his head...

01:20.231 --> 01:22.344
Believe me, Karen,
Sonny Chow is dead.

01:22.379 --> 01:24.222
I talked to the medical
examiner who did the

01:24.253 --> 01:26.167
autopsy, and I've seen
the death certificate.

01:26.202 --> 01:28.251
Well, based on the way
you talk about Sonny

01:28.252 --> 01:30.394
Chow in this book, you
better hope he's dead.

01:30.429 --> 01:33.552
Idiot. That's the last time
I do your show.

01:47.033 --> 01:47.915
Hello?

01:55.214 --> 01:58.256
My God! Who are you?
What do you want?

01:58.291 --> 01:59.400
What do you want?

01:59.435 --> 02:01.565
No, no, no!

02:05.304 --> 02:08.193
No, this is impossible.
Chow, is that you?

02:10.900 --> 02:12.394
No.

02:24.363 --> 02:26.033
MONK Season 3 Epi. 11
Mr. Monk vs. the Cobra

03:38.550 --> 03:40.903
Ah. - No, W-Wait,
what's wrong with that one?

03:40.938 --> 03:42.318
The "K" went below the line.

03:42.353 --> 03:45.151
N-no, don't throw it away!
Mr. Monk, please, I am begging you.

03:45.186 --> 03:48.309
We've been here for three hours.
We've paid two bills.

03:48.616 --> 03:50.714
I don't think the bank will take this.

03:50.749 --> 03:52.848
T-they'll cash it. I... I promise.

03:52.883 --> 03:55.916
If I'm wrong, I'll pay
your water bill myself.

03:55.951 --> 03:59.271
But, uh, let me just start over.
I... I... It'll only take a minute.

04:01.664 --> 04:02.843
- What are you doing, now?
- There you go.

04:02.878 --> 04:06.517
- Don't, don't, don't, don't!
- Too late. Already sealed it.

04:07.707 --> 04:09.644
Do you want it?

04:09.679 --> 04:12.238
You'll have to rip open the envelope.

04:15.282 --> 04:18.916
Good.
All right, next thing, um...

04:20.486 --> 04:22.828
- Here you go.
- What? Wh-what's this?

04:22.863 --> 04:26.255
Those are my expenses.
They come to $310.

04:26.290 --> 04:29.018
Oh, I don't pay those.

04:29.904 --> 04:32.292
Oh, Mr. Monk,
they're all business-related.

04:32.633 --> 04:35.203
Here, look, um...

04:37.057 --> 04:40.469
This is my gas bill,
from driving you around all day.

04:41.016 --> 04:44.135
- Uh-huh.
- This is my cell phone bill.

04:44.842 --> 04:47.358
All these calls are from you.

04:48.890 --> 04:51.900
And this is from the drugstore.

04:52.322 --> 04:54.682
I'm buying over 200 wipes a week.

04:54.717 --> 04:56.241
Here's the thing.

04:56.576 --> 04:59.382
I pay you exactly
what I paid Sharona.

04:59.672 --> 05:02.779
I didn't pay her expenses.

05:03.111 --> 05:06.729
Here's the thing.
I am not Sharona.

05:06.764 --> 05:09.712
I'm an individual.
I'm unique.

05:09.747 --> 05:12.613
Don't ever compare me
to anybody else.

05:13.997 --> 05:16.495
Sharona used to say
the exact same thing.

05:16.530 --> 05:20.306
Word for word.
Isn't that funny?

05:20.341 --> 05:22.754
Mr. Monk, are you going
to reimburse me or not?

05:22.789 --> 05:26.425
I would, if I could.
But I can't afford it.

05:33.332 --> 05:36.959
Oh, look, it's the Captain.
It's probably about a job.

05:48.962 --> 05:50.342
Aren't you gonna answer that?

05:50.377 --> 05:52.885
No, I don't want to go over
my maximum minutes.

06:11.007 --> 06:13.221
You've got to be
the cheapest man I've ever met.

06:13.256 --> 06:16.009
Hello?
Yes, sir, he's right here.

06:17.973 --> 06:19.966
Well, that sounds fascinating.

06:20.649 --> 06:21.854
Really?

06:22.566 --> 06:24.938
Well, I hope the crime scene
is within walking distance,

06:24.973 --> 06:27.023
'cause I'm not drivin' him.

06:32.723 --> 06:35.207
Get a list of tenants.
Start knockin' on doors.

06:36.081 --> 06:38.328
Lieutenant, I thought
you had the perimeter.

06:38.363 --> 06:40.652
Fist of the Cobra. 1975.

06:40.687 --> 06:42.542
I've got that same poster
in my room.

06:44.145 --> 06:45.127
Oh, look at this.

06:45.758 --> 06:47.602
That's from
Ten Fingers of Doom.

06:47.637 --> 06:49.317
He broke his arm
doing that stunt.

06:49.352 --> 06:51.007
He still finished the scene, though.

06:54.385 --> 06:56.780
- Oh, my God!
- What?

06:58.488 --> 07:00.573
He's got a bootleg copy
of Enter the Cobra.

07:02.940 --> 07:04.146
Can I have this?

07:04.181 --> 07:06.893
No, you can't have it, Detective.
This is a crime scene.

07:09.795 --> 07:11.269
Let's watch it.

07:15.311 --> 07:17.038
Fine, I'll put it back.

07:21.158 --> 07:24.567
Sir, I've got a theory on this.

07:25.126 --> 07:26.672
This guy John Ricca,

07:26.707 --> 07:28.583
he's published a book
about Sonny Chow, right?

07:28.618 --> 07:30.356
Right. - Well, it's
a real hatchet job.

07:30.391 --> 07:32.331
I mean, it made
the Cobra look terrible.

07:32.366 --> 07:34.237
- "The Cobra"?
- Sonny Chow.

07:34.272 --> 07:36.975
I mean, maybe we should
be looking for a Sonny Chow fan.

07:37.010 --> 07:38.390
I mean, they all hated the book.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.029
And most of them are pretty nuts.

07:40.064 --> 07:42.971
I mean, I see them at conventions
all the time, and they are real fanatics.

07:44.314 --> 07:45.772
Captain?

07:45.807 --> 07:48.977
Monk, thank you for coming.
Miss Teeger.

07:49.012 --> 07:51.005
I assume that they filled
you in downstairs.

07:51.040 --> 07:53.090
More or less.
How did he enter the building?

07:53.125 --> 07:56.273
He broke in through a door
on the roof around 4:00 a. m.

07:56.308 --> 07:59.409
But get this,
when he left after the murder,

07:59.444 --> 08:01.679
he took the elevator
down and ran out.

08:01.714 --> 08:03.203
He didn't mind being
seen. - Uh-uh.

08:03.238 --> 08:05.714
Was he really killed with
nunchakus? - Yeah.

08:05.749 --> 08:07.870
Hmm, check this out.

08:08.349 --> 08:09.427
Gold-plated.

08:09.939 --> 08:11.010
Look at those insignias.

08:11.045 --> 08:13.650
Sonny used a pair
just like these in Ninja Fury.

08:13.685 --> 08:15.511
The killer left these behind?

08:15.546 --> 08:17.639
Well, they either belong
to the killer or the victim.

08:17.674 --> 08:19.763
I mean, he was writing
a book on all of this crap.

08:19.798 --> 08:21.766
Captain. Here's the
videotape you wanted.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.801
Ah, thank you.

08:23.836 --> 08:29.538
Elevator B at 4:07.
Let's have a look.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.086
- Can't even see his face.
- He looks like the Cobra.

08:35.602 --> 08:38.109
And Sonny wore a uniform
just like that in Kung Fu Assassins.

08:38.144 --> 08:40.373
Sonny Chow is dead.

08:42.051 --> 08:45.299
- Doctor, give me the good news.
- He was clutching some hair.

08:45.334 --> 08:47.443
He must have grabbed
it off the killer's head.

08:47.478 --> 08:50.090
That means we have
a good shot at some DNA.

08:50.125 --> 08:51.744
How could he grab any hair?

08:51.779 --> 08:54.310
We just saw the tape.
The intruder was wearing a hood.

08:54.345 --> 08:55.968
Well, it could've fallen
off during the fight.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.646
It gets weirder.

08:57.681 --> 08:59.614
The victim wrote you a note.

09:04.948 --> 09:05.877
"Ow."

09:06.893 --> 09:10.332
Why would anybody write "ow"?
Usually that's something you'd say.

09:13.393 --> 09:16.321
Oh, my God.
Chow. He's alive.

09:17.774 --> 09:20.538
Sir, the rumors are true.

09:20.573 --> 09:22.001
He's been hiding out overseas,

09:22.036 --> 09:24.363
just waiting for the right time
to make a comeback.

09:24.398 --> 09:28.075
- Captain, he's alive.
- Nah.

09:29.140 --> 09:32.612
Nah, there's got to be
another explanation, right?

09:35.368 --> 09:36.464
Wipe.

09:39.939 --> 09:42.679
Oh, you know what,
these are mine.

09:42.714 --> 09:43.963
I paid for them.

09:57.247 --> 09:58.102
Captain.

09:58.137 --> 10:00.574
- Hey, got a minute?
- Sure.

10:03.572 --> 10:04.784
What are you doin'?

10:04.819 --> 10:09.749
Well, nothing, I was just
polishing the... the light bulbs.

10:10.309 --> 10:11.800
What's going on?

10:11.835 --> 10:17.282
Uh, you remember that convention
I went to in Atlanta about three years ago?

10:17.317 --> 10:18.283
Uh...

10:18.318 --> 10:21.213
Well, something happened there
that I didn't tell you about.

10:21.248 --> 10:26.728
I landed, I hailed a cab,
and I recognized the cab driver.

10:26.763 --> 10:28.167
It was Harold Burnshaw.

10:28.725 --> 10:31.225
- Burnshaw?
- Burnshaw. He used to be a Fed.

10:31.260 --> 10:32.679
He was a real player.

10:32.714 --> 10:38.358
He used to head the FBI's field office
in Atlanta until the 1996 Olympic games.

10:38.393 --> 10:41.139
- The plaza bombing?
- Exactly.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.243
They accused the wrong guy.

10:43.278 --> 10:45.967
Burnshaw booted it big time
on network television.

10:46.002 --> 10:48.836
Instant career killer.
Now he's drivin' a cab.

10:48.871 --> 10:51.303
Monk, you should've seen his face.
I'll never forget it.

10:51.338 --> 10:54.346
Well, uh, what does this have
to do with... - Twenty years ago,

10:54.381 --> 10:58.666
Sonny Chow froze some of his own blood
in the event that he needed surgery.

10:58.701 --> 11:02.188
So they've got bulletproof
DNA for a comparison.

11:02.223 --> 11:05.852
And that's a prelim on the hair
we found at the crime scene.

11:09.361 --> 11:11.885
- It's a match.
- It's Sonny Chow's hair.

11:12.723 --> 11:14.474
No question about it.

11:15.307 --> 11:19.913
He's been dead for six years,
and he's my primary suspect. - Yeah.

11:19.948 --> 11:21.839
Now, if I go public
with this and I'm wrong

11:21.874 --> 11:23.987
I'm going to wind
up at the airport,

11:24.022 --> 11:27.145
picking up cops
who still have jobs.

11:27.180 --> 11:29.233
Can you help me with this?
I mean, I've got to know.

11:29.268 --> 11:32.803
I've got to be certain:
Is this guy alive or dead?

11:38.074 --> 11:40.015
I thought Sonny Chow
lived in Hollywood.

11:40.050 --> 11:43.421
No, he lived in this house,
before he became famous.

11:43.456 --> 11:45.253
Then he moved back here
when he was sick.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.991
According to his file,
this is where he died.

11:48.026 --> 11:50.273
Or did he?
Whoo!

11:50.308 --> 11:52.871
No, don't, don't... don't do that.

11:52.906 --> 11:56.114
- What's this guy's name?
- Zee Tai Wen.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.146
They called him Master Zee.

11:58.181 --> 12:00.484
He was Sonny Chow's mentor.

12:00.519 --> 12:02.554
If Chow is still alive,

12:02.589 --> 12:04.640
Master Zee would know it.

12:04.675 --> 12:07.320
Look, Mr. Monk, can we please
talk about reimbursing me?

12:07.355 --> 12:08.163
Not now.

12:09.922 --> 12:11.459
Hello.

12:11.494 --> 12:13.455
We phoned earlier.
I'm Adrian Monk.

12:13.490 --> 12:15.073
This is Natalie Teeger.

12:15.108 --> 12:18.505
We're helping the police with
a very important matter.

12:19.346 --> 12:21.880
- How are you?
- I am well.

12:22.761 --> 12:26.132
Hello.
How are you?

12:26.167 --> 12:29.629
- Well, how are you?
- Do not be insulted.

12:29.664 --> 12:32.549
Wee Ling has not spoken
in nine years.

12:32.584 --> 12:34.485
A vow of silence.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.449
He is cleansing his soul.

12:36.484 --> 12:38.449
You should give that a shot.

12:39.646 --> 12:41.525
We were hoping to speak
with Master Zee.

12:42.599 --> 12:45.027
Please, come in.

12:45.062 --> 12:48.338
The Master always has time
for a stranger in need.

12:51.984 --> 12:54.957
Please remove your shoes.

12:54.992 --> 12:56.710
Oh.

12:57.678 --> 13:00.101
Oh.
Here's the thing.

13:01.505 --> 13:03.756
I'd rather not, if that's okay?

13:03.791 --> 13:05.924
There are no exceptions, Mr. Monk.

13:05.959 --> 13:08.291
Even the Master's feet are bare.

13:08.772 --> 13:11.700
I understand.
Here's the thing.

13:11.735 --> 13:15.479
I'm a little
shy.

13:15.514 --> 13:17.885
I never... I never go barefoot.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.800
It's true, I've never seen his feet.

13:19.835 --> 13:21.266
I've never seen my feet.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.070
For all I know,
I could have 18 toes.

13:27.116 --> 13:30.018
- He's good.
- So, you are refusing.

13:30.053 --> 13:33.677
Not just that.
Uh,

13:33.712 --> 13:37.987
I would like to ask all of you,
as a favor, as a personal favor,

13:38.022 --> 13:40.595
to put your shoes back on.

13:40.630 --> 13:42.743
If that's not too much trouble.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.460
I am sorry, Mr. Monk,

13:44.495 --> 13:47.204
but I must ask both of you to leave.

13:55.226 --> 13:57.511
Where are you going? Where...
It's not that big a deal.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.283
Just take off the shoes.

13:59.318 --> 14:01.051
- Take 'em off.
- Okay.

14:11.121 --> 14:15.066
Um,
have the... the rugs

14:15.101 --> 14:17.878
been cleaned recently?
And shampooed?

14:17.913 --> 14:19.587
I don't know.

14:19.622 --> 14:23.340
Has the Master heard
of athlete's foot?

14:23.375 --> 14:25.953
Because the fungus and the bacteria,

14:25.988 --> 14:27.767
can get up in between the toes...

14:27.802 --> 14:29.966
Oh, for Christ's sake,
just take 'em off!

14:32.851 --> 14:36.736
Wee Ling, you have spoken.
You must begin again.

14:36.771 --> 14:38.378
Oh, forget it.

14:40.865 --> 14:42.740
Nine years, huh?

14:43.525 --> 14:45.842
- Please don't look.
- You have nice feet.

14:45.877 --> 14:47.406
You shouldn't be embarrassed.

14:47.441 --> 14:48.987
Oh, yeah.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.871
Students from around the world
come to study at Master Zee's feet.

14:51.906 --> 14:54.411
His bare feet?

14:54.446 --> 14:55.885
That is correct.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.117
This is where Sonny Chow,
learned the art of Bow Yu Chuan.

14:59.152 --> 15:01.171
This is where he became the Cobra.

15:01.206 --> 15:02.845
Did you know him?

15:02.880 --> 15:05.340
Can one man truly know another man?

15:05.375 --> 15:08.209
Okay, but did you ever meet him?

15:08.244 --> 15:10.702
Yes. Once, near the end.

15:10.737 --> 15:13.093
He was very sick, could not speak.

15:13.128 --> 15:14.891
But his spirit was strong.

15:14.926 --> 15:16.020
He was a great man.

15:16.055 --> 15:19.980
Well, there's... there's a rumor
that he is still alive.

15:20.015 --> 15:21.905
Sonny Chow is alive in all of us.

15:21.940 --> 15:23.069
Right. Right. Right.

15:23.104 --> 15:26.648
But is... is... is he here?
Right here, right now?

15:26.683 --> 15:29.179
You're a very curious man, Mr. Monk.

15:29.214 --> 15:31.287
He certainly is.

15:31.322 --> 15:32.741
Let me... let me ask you,

15:32.776 --> 15:35.042
are you guys reimbursed
for your business-related expenses,

15:35.077 --> 15:37.998
Natalie... - like your laundry, and
these boards that everybody's breakin'?

15:38.033 --> 15:39.807
Who pays for that stuff? - Natalie.

15:39.842 --> 15:40.886
Please stay here.

15:40.921 --> 15:43.254
I will see if Master Zee
is ready for you.

15:43.762 --> 15:46.947
I told you I cannot afford
to pay your expenses.

15:46.982 --> 15:48.704
Okay, then what about this?

15:48.739 --> 15:50.180
I do your bills
with you, remember?

15:50.215 --> 15:51.992
This is a rent receipt.

15:52.027 --> 15:54.775
You're renting an office
downtown for $600 a month?

15:54.810 --> 15:55.583
That's right.

15:55.618 --> 15:56.902
Wh-when was the last time
you were there?

15:56.937 --> 15:58.352
I... I never use it.

15:58.387 --> 16:00.157
It's just sitting there, empty?

16:00.192 --> 16:02.127
I could really use
that money, Mr. Monk.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.717
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- You don't wanna talk about it.

16:04.752 --> 16:06.716
All right, then let's do this.

16:06.751 --> 16:09.193
We'll ask the wizard
what he thinks

16:09.228 --> 16:12.005
and then we'll both agree
to do whatever he says.

16:12.040 --> 16:14.689
First off, he is not a wizard.
We are not over the rainbow.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.251
We're in the middle of
a homicide investigation.

16:17.286 --> 16:19.071
This is a serious matter.

16:19.106 --> 16:21.097
- I'm going to ask him.
- No, don't ask him.

16:21.132 --> 16:22.927
I'm asking him.

16:36.718 --> 16:39.503
- What did you do?
- Sorry.

16:39.538 --> 16:44.474
He was a little off center.
It was not, you know, in harmony.

16:46.565 --> 16:48.233
The Master will see you now.

17:08.709 --> 17:12.098
A great sorrow has entered this room.

17:12.797 --> 17:14.167
That would be me.

17:16.936 --> 17:19.598
And there is a woman with you.

17:20.093 --> 17:23.299
She is very beautiful.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.025
How can you tell?

17:25.060 --> 17:29.496
I could hear Mr. Huang's heart
beating faster.

17:31.105 --> 17:33.357
Now that I see you,

17:33.392 --> 17:36.036
it is obvious why.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.587
Master Zee,

17:40.632 --> 17:42.860
my name is Adrian Monk.

17:43.661 --> 17:45.612
This is Natalie Teeger.

17:45.647 --> 17:49.173
We would like to ask you
some questions about Sonny Chow.

17:49.208 --> 17:50.627
You were his teacher?

17:51.161 --> 17:53.245
That is true.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.499
But I also learned from him.

17:56.436 --> 17:58.551
A man was murdered t-two nights ago,

17:58.586 --> 18:02.304
and there is evidence
that Sonny Chow was responsible.

18:03.052 --> 18:05.815
Cobra is dead, Mr. Monk.

18:07.142 --> 18:08.864
Are you sure about that?

18:09.774 --> 18:13.994
He died in my arms six years ago.

18:14.029 --> 18:18.116
I felt his spirit leaving his body.

18:19.621 --> 18:22.078
If he were still alive

18:22.113 --> 18:24.561
and you were hiding him,

18:25.339 --> 18:27.697
that would be a very serious crime.

18:30.797 --> 18:33.764
It would be worse than a crime.

18:33.799 --> 18:36.018
It would be a lie.

18:36.053 --> 18:38.626
A man who speaks only the truth

18:38.661 --> 18:40.716
has nothing to fear.

18:40.751 --> 18:42.546
Don't you agree?

18:45.142 --> 18:47.018
Yes, I do.

18:47.962 --> 18:51.179
I'm sorry.
I disappointed you.

18:51.214 --> 18:55.410
But I am feeling something else.

19:05.199 --> 19:09.456
Oh, my.
A troubled soul.

19:09.491 --> 19:12.142
You are on a quest, Mr. Monk.

19:13.085 --> 19:15.340
That's right.

19:15.375 --> 19:19.590
You live in a very dark place.

19:20.162 --> 19:23.000
The darkness is your fear.

19:27.983 --> 19:31.517
Take this as a gift.

19:31.552 --> 19:34.897
Light is your weapon, Mr. Monk.

19:35.603 --> 19:38.732
Be the light.

19:40.151 --> 19:43.380
Thank you.
Thank you.

19:48.661 --> 19:50.996
Excuse me, Mr. Master man.

19:51.031 --> 19:52.873
I am also troubled.

19:52.908 --> 19:54.462
He is not paying me
what he promised.

19:54.497 --> 19:56.761
- That is not true.
- Could you please talk to him?

19:56.796 --> 19:58.497
There's no way I can
cover my expenses.

19:58.532 --> 20:01.285
Mr. Zee, I pay her exactly
what I paid my other assistant.

20:01.320 --> 20:02.916
Which is exactly why she had to quit.

20:02.951 --> 20:05.270
- That's not the reason, really.
- It was a factor.

20:05.305 --> 20:10.993
- I don't think you really understand...
- Excuse me. Miss Teeger,

20:11.028 --> 20:15.955
this man is your employer.
He is your master.

20:15.990 --> 20:19.802
It is your job to serve
him unquestioningly.

20:21.611 --> 20:26.692
Mr. Monk, you should not pay her
any more money. - Okay.

20:26.727 --> 20:32.799
She must learn that true wealth
is in the heart. Not in the bank.

20:33.339 --> 20:36.498
- It's... it's not in the bank.
- All right.

20:37.455 --> 20:41.008
You... you are a wise
and learned man.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.965
As are you.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.611
It must be a tremendous burden
to possess such wisdom.

20:48.072 --> 20:51.300
It is a gift.
And a curse.

20:51.335 --> 20:54.305
Exactly. - Okay, okay,
oh, my God, get a room, really.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.697
I would. Just get it over with.

20:59.534 --> 21:00.773
Hello?

21:02.973 --> 21:04.243
What is it?

21:04.278 --> 21:07.106
He's alive.
Sonny Chow is alive.

21:07.141 --> 21:09.051
He pulled an Elvis,
faked his own death.

21:09.086 --> 21:10.539
- He pulled an Elvis?
- Yes.

21:10.574 --> 21:13.797
Check this out. Six years ago,
a man named Joseph Lee

21:13.832 --> 21:16.608
disappeared from a homeless
shelter in the Presidio

21:16.643 --> 21:19.478
one day before Sonny Chow "died."

21:19.513 --> 21:21.185
They were the same
height and same weight.

21:21.220 --> 21:24.102
- It could be a coincidence.
- Well, we're about to find out.

21:24.137 --> 21:26.166
We just got a court order
to exhume the body.

21:26.201 --> 21:27.275
They're diggin' it up now.

21:27.310 --> 21:29.360
Lieutenant, you understand
if Sonny Chow is alive,

21:29.395 --> 21:31.540
he's murdered at least two people.

21:31.575 --> 21:33.531
Uh-huh. - You'd have to arrest him.

21:33.566 --> 21:34.562
I'd get to meet him.

21:34.597 --> 21:36.272
He might try to kill you.

21:36.307 --> 21:37.496
You think so?

21:37.531 --> 21:40.276
Wow, that would be so cool.
Sonny Chow.

21:48.381 --> 21:51.310
Captain, how are you feelin'?

21:51.345 --> 21:53.196
I'm a nervous wreck.

21:53.925 --> 21:55.749
How'd things go
with the Zen master?

21:55.784 --> 21:59.833
Oh, he said Sonny Chow
died in his arms. I believe him.

22:00.725 --> 22:03.180
Good. At least the press
hasn't gotten wind of this yet.

22:03.215 --> 22:06.665
Once they do, it's gonna be like
Christmas morning for those vultures.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.760
- Look at that thing.
- Oh, yeah.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.709
His fan club from
the Philippines paid for it.

22:11.477 --> 22:13.072
Be... be careful with that.

22:13.107 --> 22:16.196
- Tell him to be careful with that.
- What did you say?

22:16.231 --> 22:17.484
Well, you'll wanna
be careful with that.

22:17.519 --> 22:19.854
I've been doing this job
since I was 18 years old.

22:19.889 --> 22:21.308
I think I know
what I'm doin', all right?

22:21.343 --> 22:23.119
I don't come to your
station house and tell

22:23.120 --> 22:24.975
you how to beat a
confession out of some kid.

22:25.654 --> 22:27.236
Do I know you?

22:27.789 --> 22:29.072
Maybe you do.

22:30.447 --> 22:31.652
You're Chris Downey.

22:32.148 --> 22:33.627
They let you out?

22:33.962 --> 22:37.040
I did my time. Now I'm doing my job.
Or at least I'm trying to.

22:37.075 --> 22:40.365
I busted this low-life
for assault and armed robbery.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.269
Got me on the assault.
There was no robbery.

22:42.304 --> 22:44.269
Right, we never did recover
the jewels you stole.

22:44.304 --> 22:46.650
Allegedly stole.
Allegedly.

22:46.685 --> 22:48.058
I love that word.

22:51.842 --> 22:52.934
All righty.

22:52.969 --> 22:54.556
What do you think?

22:54.591 --> 22:55.843
I think he's in there.

22:55.878 --> 22:57.169
For how much?

23:08.512 --> 23:10.895
Mr. Monk, this was not
in my job description.

23:11.443 --> 23:12.458
Let's get out of here.

23:12.493 --> 23:15.994
Oh, I'm okay.
What a beautiful pancreas.

23:17.234 --> 23:18.941
Okay, here we go.

23:18.976 --> 23:21.165
- Hello.
- Oh, my God.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.991
We're so sorry to disturb you.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.757
Hey, you're the expert.
Is it him or not?

23:33.792 --> 23:35.886
It's just hard to say.

23:35.921 --> 23:39.640
Sonny had a lot more hair.
And skin.

23:39.675 --> 23:41.295
We'll know soon enough.

23:41.675 --> 23:46.209
It'll take two minutes to compare these
with his old dental records.

23:46.621 --> 23:48.679
- I'm going with you.
- Me, too.

23:50.414 --> 23:53.032
Look. I'm crazy about spleens.

23:53.067 --> 23:54.630
Why don't you ask 'em,
maybe they'll give you one.

23:54.665 --> 23:56.090
You can keep it
in your office downtown?

23:56.125 --> 23:57.783
It's not my office.

23:58.264 --> 24:00.116
What do you mean,
it's not your office?

24:00.151 --> 24:01.667
It's Trudy's office.

24:02.487 --> 24:05.118
Yeah, all her things are in there:

24:05.153 --> 24:08.114
Her books and
her pictures, her files.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.843
- I can't give it up.
- It's Trudy's office?

24:11.307 --> 24:12.930
Sonny, is there an echo in here?

24:12.965 --> 24:15.078
- She died nine years ago, right?
- That's right.

24:15.113 --> 24:18.003
You've been keeping an office
downtown for nine years.

24:18.038 --> 24:20.747
Meanwhile, I'm counting
pennies at Safeway?

24:20.782 --> 24:22.698
Get rid of the office!

24:22.733 --> 24:24.321
Put her stuff in storage or an attic.

24:24.356 --> 24:25.640
I'll do it for you.

24:25.675 --> 24:26.998
I can't. - You can't,
or you won't?

24:27.033 --> 24:29.224
I can't, and I won't.

24:29.793 --> 24:32.141
So, you're just gonna
have to deal with that.

24:32.176 --> 24:34.824
- I quit my job over this!
- Ow! That hurt!

24:34.859 --> 24:36.405
Oh, it's only a pillow.

24:36.873 --> 24:37.899
Well, it hurt.

24:40.513 --> 24:42.318
That came from the coffin?

24:42.353 --> 24:43.754
That's a death pillow.

24:43.789 --> 24:45.714
You hit me with a death pillow?

24:45.749 --> 24:47.330
Give me a wipe.

24:47.709 --> 24:48.837
- Here.
- Wipe!

24:48.872 --> 24:51.105
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I hit you with the death pillow.

24:52.422 --> 24:54.418
Mr. Monk, I lost my husband.

24:54.453 --> 24:58.236
I know what you're going through.
But I have a daughter to think about.

24:58.271 --> 25:01.725
If you don't cover these expenses,
I can't work for you.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.010
But it's Trudy's office.

25:04.692 --> 25:08.845
It is official.
Sonny Chow is dead.

25:08.880 --> 25:12.786
- So it is him.
- Yeah, it's a positive ID.

25:12.821 --> 25:14.701
All the x-rays match.

25:15.034 --> 25:17.459
Well, that was the opposite of fun.

25:18.331 --> 25:20.113
So, I guess we're
back to square one.

25:20.148 --> 25:23.114
Lieutenant, see that Mr. Chow
makes it back to the cemetery.

25:23.149 --> 25:25.278
And tell my old pal, Chris Downey,

25:25.313 --> 25:27.891
- to stick him back in his hole.
- Yes, sir.

25:27.926 --> 25:30.155
Well, I guess I'm off
the hook. - Yeah.

25:30.634 --> 25:32.045
But, what the hell's
goin' on here, Monk?

25:32.080 --> 25:35.498
Well, somebody, somehow
got hold of a few strands

25:35.533 --> 25:38.173
of Sonny Chow's hair
and left them at the crime scene.

25:38.208 --> 25:42.390
Yeah, but why would anybody want to
frame a guy that's been dead for six years?

25:42.425 --> 25:44.014
I don't know.

25:51.514 --> 25:52.642
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

25:52.677 --> 25:56.493
Yeah, well, at least I got to have
my picture with Sonny Chow.

25:56.528 --> 25:57.825
You took a picture?

25:57.860 --> 26:00.818
- Yeah. Maybe I'll donate it.
- What?

26:00.853 --> 26:03.036
There's a Sonny Chow
museum in Daly City.

26:03.071 --> 26:05.171
Probably give me
a lifetime pass for this.

26:05.206 --> 26:06.921
There's a museum?

26:11.425 --> 26:13.043
Hello?

26:13.549 --> 26:15.823
Looks like we missed the crowd.

26:19.874 --> 26:23.482
- It says $5.
- Suggested donation.

26:23.517 --> 26:27.561
I considered their suggestion.
I appreciate their suggestion.

26:27.596 --> 26:31.158
- I decided to give less.
- I have a suggestion for you.

26:31.193 --> 26:34.246
Oh, hey! I didn't hear you come in.
Welcome to Cobra's Lair.

26:34.281 --> 26:37.318
I'm Eddie Frankel, the proprietor. You,
can ask me anything about Sonny Chow.

26:37.353 --> 26:40.793
I've been a Cobra-head ever since I
first saw Fist of the Cobra when I was 12.

26:40.828 --> 26:42.172
You guys big Sonny Chow fans?

26:42.207 --> 26:44.252
- You are or you wouldn't be here.
- Well, we're not exactly.

26:44.287 --> 26:46.836
Well, we've the second-largest collection
of his memorabilia in the country.

26:46.871 --> 26:49.588
Oh, here's an interesting fact:
Most people think that Jackie Chan

26:49.623 --> 26:52.877
invented the martial arts style
referred to as Wing Fu Do.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.842
But Sonny was doing triple
roundhouse kicks as early as 1968.

26:55.877 --> 26:57.940
Watch the opening scene of Night
of the Cobra, if you don't believe me.

26:57.975 --> 26:58.777
We believe you.
We believe you.

26:58.812 --> 27:01.611
Um, I'm Adrian Monk
and this is Natalie Teeger.

27:01.646 --> 27:04.598
Oh, here. Here's a pamphlet,
tells you about upcoming events.

27:04.633 --> 27:06.865
Got a floor plan of the museum inside.
We had a self-guided tour

27:06.900 --> 27:09.509
but my stupid cousin borrowed my
headphones and never returned them.

27:09.544 --> 27:12.701
Oh, hey, almost forgot,
have to stamp the back of your hand

27:12.736 --> 27:15.778
- in case you want to come back.
- Hey, now that's not really necessary.

27:17.070 --> 27:19.506
Oh, here, here, here,
you can stamp mine.

27:24.075 --> 27:26.236
Okay, well, um,
most people start over here.

27:26.271 --> 27:27.825
And they work their
way counterclockwise.

27:27.860 --> 27:29.665
As you can see
it's all arranged chronologically,

27:29.700 --> 27:31.038
from the birth of the Cobra

27:31.073 --> 27:33.230
until six years ago when he faked his
own death and went underground. Here,

27:33.265 --> 27:35.867
Oh, here, this is Sonny Chow's
actual birth certificate.

27:35.902 --> 27:37.839
His real name was
what? Anybody?

27:37.874 --> 27:38.797
Anybody? - Uh...

27:38.832 --> 27:40.591
That's right! Chow Chiang Wu.

27:40.626 --> 27:42.654
He was born here in San Francisco,
but raised in Hong Kong.

27:42.689 --> 27:46.392
We-we're really not here
to see the museum today.

27:46.427 --> 27:48.749
Um, we're working with the police
on a homicide investigation.

27:48.784 --> 27:50.402
Homicide? You mean, murder?

27:50.437 --> 27:52.664
Eddie, where were you
Tuesday night around midnight?

27:52.699 --> 27:56.509
I was at home watching
Blood rage Two. No, Three.

27:56.544 --> 27:57.875
Uh, I guess both.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.727
- Were you alone?
- No.

27:59.762 --> 28:02.153
- I was watching with my girlfriend.
- And what's her name?

28:07.956 --> 28:10.116
- Natalie.
- Eddie.

28:10.151 --> 28:13.638
Eddie, is anything missing
from the museum? - Like what?

28:13.673 --> 28:17.002
Like a personal item
of Sonny Chow's, uh,

28:17.037 --> 28:20.202
a... a piece of clothing,
or... or... or a hat.

28:20.237 --> 28:22.992
Something that might
have had his hair on it.

28:23.027 --> 28:25.015
No. There was
a break-in last week.

28:25.050 --> 28:27.859
Somebody pried open the back door
but they didn't take anything.

28:28.143 --> 28:30.614
Uh, excuse me, remember,
you're supposed to go counterclockwise?

28:30.968 --> 28:34.072
- Is this his hairbrush?
- Oh, that's right.

28:34.107 --> 28:37.114
Sonny used that brush while he was
filming Death and the Darkness in 1985.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.823
I bought it from
his personal hairstylist.

28:38.858 --> 28:43.445
So that's his actual hair in the bristles.
Could I see that? - Sure.

28:53.036 --> 28:56.551
"Made in Croatia." - So?

28:56.586 --> 28:59.667
Croatia's a new country.
It didn't exist until 1992.

28:59.702 --> 29:03.706
Oh, my God. I've been rooked!
He sold me a phony hairbrush!

29:03.741 --> 29:07.847
I don't think so.
Somebody picked this lock.

29:08.433 --> 29:10.961
Someone broke in here,

29:10.996 --> 29:14.782
took the real brush,
and replaced it with this one.

29:22.774 --> 29:25.061
- Oh, my God.
- What?

29:26.454 --> 29:29.537
I've got it.
At least, I think I do.

29:30.258 --> 29:32.366
We got to get back to the
Fair Lawn Cemetery fast.

29:32.401 --> 29:34.945
W-wait, wait, wait!
Did you say Fair Lawn Cemetery?

29:35.950 --> 29:38.549
That's where Sonny Chow's
empty coffin is buried.

29:38.584 --> 29:41.244
You see, the Hong Kong
drug cartel, they own 20%...

29:41.279 --> 29:42.563
Eddie, Eddie.
Sonny Chow is dead.

29:42.598 --> 29:44.679
We dug him up three
hours ago, he's dead.

29:45.760 --> 29:48.402
- It can't be true.
- Sorry, Eddie.

29:59.017 --> 30:00.194
Feel this one.

30:00.766 --> 30:03.482
I don't want to feel the pillow,
Mr. Monk. It's after 5:00.

30:03.517 --> 30:07.236
- It's soft, huh? They're all so soft.
- I'm sure they are.

30:07.271 --> 30:09.634
But I told you, I have to have
an answer by the end of today.

30:09.669 --> 30:13.369
Natalie. Natalie, you remember that pillow
you threw at me, the one from the coffin?

30:13.404 --> 30:15.342
I think there was something in it.

30:15.377 --> 30:17.276
That's why it hurt.
Here's what happened.

30:17.311 --> 30:20.116
That gravedigger, Chris Downey,
the one that Capt. Stottlemeyer...

30:20.151 --> 30:22.213
I don't care about
the case, Mr. Monk.

30:22.248 --> 30:24.212
Julie is at home waiting for me.

30:24.247 --> 30:25.439
So what's the deal?

30:25.474 --> 30:29.046
Are you going to pay
for my expenses or not?

30:33.396 --> 30:35.012
I'm sorry.

30:35.047 --> 30:37.795
So that's it.
Well, I'm sorry, too, Mr. Monk.

30:38.472 --> 30:42.184
I guess this is goodbye.
It was nice working with you.

30:45.527 --> 30:46.931
Natalie.

30:47.625 --> 30:50.824
I... I... I solved the case!

30:50.859 --> 30:53.658
- Aren't you interested?
- I'm interested.

31:37.620 --> 31:38.798
Mr. Monk?

31:40.189 --> 31:41.471
Hello?

31:44.373 --> 31:47.182
Listen, I'm really sorry
that I ran out like that, I...

31:54.720 --> 31:56.369
Mr. Monk?

31:57.582 --> 31:58.988
Mr. Monk?

32:02.097 --> 32:04.055
Trudy.

32:04.090 --> 32:05.619
Hello, Adrian.

32:06.938 --> 32:10.961
- Where are we?
- We're near the Botanical Gardens.

32:11.738 --> 32:17.066
Do you remember that Sunday
we just walked and walked and walked?

32:17.101 --> 32:18.734
I loved that day.

32:19.833 --> 32:24.223
That was the best day
of my life.

32:24.258 --> 32:26.536
Darling, I think you should
put the candle out.

32:26.571 --> 32:30.583
- It's using up all the oxygen.
- No. I don't care.

32:32.676 --> 32:35.050
I don't know, I don't know what happened.

32:35.085 --> 32:37.507
He mentioned something
about that gravedigger, Downey.

32:37.542 --> 32:41.219
I left for maybe 30 minutes.
When I came back, he was gone.

32:41.949 --> 32:43.689
So, what... what do I do?

32:46.324 --> 32:48.146
What do you think?

32:48.741 --> 32:52.731
Well, I...
I...

32:53.322 --> 32:56.577
I can't do it. I... I...
I can't do it. - Adrian.

32:57.162 --> 33:00.700
I'm not 25 anymore. We need
to talk about this sometime.

33:00.735 --> 33:02.910
What kind of father would I be?

33:03.249 --> 33:05.748
You know what my family was like.

33:06.552 --> 33:10.666
Our children will be much happier
than you were, I promise.

33:31.889 --> 33:33.851
I should have said yes.

33:37.710 --> 33:40.838
I should have said yes.

33:55.001 --> 33:57.549
Turn off the motor
and throw your keys out the window!

33:57.584 --> 33:59.567
Show me your hands, Downey!
Show me your hands!

33:59.602 --> 34:01.439
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!

34:01.975 --> 34:03.770
Natalie, stay back.
Stay back.

34:05.898 --> 34:07.397
Where's Monk?
What did you do with him?

34:07.432 --> 34:10.445
Relax, Captain.
He's still alive. For now.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.960
Where is he? What did you do?
You'll be savin' both your lives.

34:12.995 --> 34:16.579
You wanna find your friend.
I want somethin', too.

34:16.614 --> 34:18.393
I want a car to the airport.

34:18.429 --> 34:20.311
I'm already packed.

34:20.346 --> 34:23.954
I want a jet that can fly
2,000 miles without refueling.

34:23.989 --> 34:25.927
When I'm in the air,
I'll tell you,

34:25.962 --> 34:29.937
A: Where I'm goin',
and B: Where you can dig up...

34:29.972 --> 34:33.849
Yeah, "dig."
You can dig...

34:35.409 --> 34:37.206
Oh, my God, I think
he's having a heart attack!

34:37.241 --> 34:39.428
- Downey!
- He's got no pulse. - Downey!

34:39.876 --> 34:41.795
Don't die on us!
Don't die on us!

34:41.830 --> 34:43.708
Where's Monk? Downey!

34:43.743 --> 34:46.513
Where's Monk?
Where's Monk?

34:47.943 --> 34:50.237
We both know what's
happening here, Adrian.

34:50.737 --> 34:53.103
You're having what Dr. Kroger
would call a psychotic break.

34:53.138 --> 34:54.824
It's a defense mechanism.

34:56.482 --> 34:58.705
How long do you have?

34:58.740 --> 35:00.490
Uh, there's

35:00.525 --> 35:04.254
50 cubic feet of air in the coffin.

35:04.289 --> 35:07.707
35 minutes, maybe 40.

35:10.214 --> 35:12.416
Let's talk about something else.

35:14.042 --> 35:16.337
How did you know it
was the gravedigger?

35:16.372 --> 35:20.635
I noticed the stamp
on the back of his hand.

35:20.676 --> 35:23.130
At the time, I didn't
think anything about it.

35:23.165 --> 35:28.195
But then later, I saw the exact same
stamp on Natalie's hand.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.476
So you knew Chris Downey
had been to the museum.

35:31.511 --> 35:35.999
That's right.
He stole Sonny Chow's hairbrush.

35:36.272 --> 35:39.739
Because he needed Chow's DNA,
so he could frame him for murder.

35:39.774 --> 35:43.379
- But why Sonny Chow?
- So the police would exhume his body.

35:43.414 --> 35:45.862
It all started six years ago.

35:46.185 --> 35:48.080
I remember the case.

35:48.115 --> 35:51.542
Downey had stolen
$500,000 in jewels from a courier.

35:51.577 --> 35:55.415
During the getaway,
he assaulted an off-duty cop.

35:55.450 --> 35:58.989
He was convicted on the assault,
but they couldn't get him on the robbery.

35:59.024 --> 36:01.423
- They never found the diamonds.
- Exactly.

36:01.458 --> 36:04.106
He was working here
at the cemetery.

36:04.141 --> 36:07.757
Before he went home, he must've
stopped here and hid the jewels.

36:07.792 --> 36:11.536
Where? - In Sonny Chow's coffin.
It was perfect.

36:11.571 --> 36:14.123
Chow was scheduled
to be buried the next day.

36:14.158 --> 36:17.162
Downey figured he could
always come back and dig it up.

36:17.197 --> 36:19.973
Even five or six years later.

36:20.008 --> 36:22.364
You felt 'em in the pillowcase.

36:22.399 --> 36:25.876
You felt 'em when Natalie
hit you in the back. - That's right.

36:25.911 --> 36:27.457
I want that backhoe running.

36:27.492 --> 36:29.708
Ready and running!
Keep it running!

36:29.743 --> 36:31.113
All right, listen up!

36:31.148 --> 36:35.590
We figure he's got about 40 minutes
of air if he's not panicking.

36:35.969 --> 36:38.033
Figure on 15 minutes.

36:38.068 --> 36:40.604
This is Monk.
I want the best you got.

36:40.639 --> 36:43.272
So, we're gonna spread out
and we're gonna work the grid, all right?

36:43.307 --> 36:47.529
We're looking for fresh dirt, tire tracks,
boot prints, anything!

36:47.564 --> 36:48.439
- Captain...
- Go, go!

36:48.474 --> 36:50.321
Captain, there's a problem.

36:50.356 --> 36:54.615
The cemetery has just expanded. They
just tore down a restaurant over there.

36:54.650 --> 36:56.453
It's all dug up.
It's like an acre-and-a-half.

36:56.488 --> 36:57.772
Monk could be anywhere.

36:57.807 --> 36:59.106
Captain, it's already been 20 minutes.

36:59.141 --> 37:01.688
Even if we find him,
he'll be a basket case.

37:01.723 --> 37:05.306
Heads up, everybody!
This way! Let's go!

37:06.707 --> 37:10.303
So Chris Downey went
to prison for six years.

37:10.867 --> 37:14.472
He was paroled three weeks ago.

37:14.507 --> 37:16.789
When he came back
to dig up the jewels,

37:17.305 --> 37:20.328
He must've had
the shock of his life.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.763
- The monument?
- Exactly.

37:23.091 --> 37:28.715
While he was gone,
some fan club put up a monument.

37:28.750 --> 37:34.344
Solid granite.
Weight, 3 tons.

37:34.379 --> 37:36.314
He realized

37:36.349 --> 37:37.694
he couldn't

37:37.729 --> 37:40.759
Dig the coffin up.
At least, not quietly. - Uh-huh.

37:40.794 --> 37:42.988
Or by himself.

37:43.656 --> 37:45.729
So he got his old job

37:45.764 --> 37:47.140
back

37:47.175 --> 37:50.384
at the cemetery

37:50.419 --> 37:54.211
and then framed
Sonny Chow for murder

37:54.246 --> 37:56.925
and got the police

37:57.459 --> 37:58.958
to dig up the jewels

38:00.289 --> 38:03.483
- For him.
- Congratulations, Detective.

38:05.248 --> 38:07.267
Lot of good it does me here.

38:07.302 --> 38:09.016
All right, darling.
Shh. It's all right.

38:09.051 --> 38:10.768
- I can't breathe.
- It's all right.

38:11.732 --> 38:13.859
- Adrian, Adrian.
- I can't...

38:13.894 --> 38:16.439
- Okay, save your breath.
- ...breathe.

38:16.474 --> 38:19.033
Save your breath.
It's all right.

38:23.611 --> 38:25.937
Should we bring
in the cadaver dogs?

38:26.778 --> 38:28.816
Not yet.

38:34.701 --> 38:37.208
- The traffic light's out.
- What?

38:37.649 --> 38:39.610
That traffic light is out.

38:40.013 --> 38:42.404
It was working three hours ago
when I got here.

38:43.975 --> 38:46.593
- Son of a bitch!
- What? What?

38:52.810 --> 38:55.366
I think he cut the power line
when he was digging the hole!

38:55.693 --> 38:57.782
- Dig along here!
- Over here! Over here!

38:58.237 --> 38:59.719
He cut the cable, everyone!

38:59.754 --> 39:01.038
Start there! There, there!

39:01.482 --> 39:04.239
Dig along this line.
Find the power cable.

39:06.804 --> 39:10.746
- You're so beautiful. I...
- Shh.

39:10.781 --> 39:14.291
I should have taken more pictures.

39:14.326 --> 39:17.456
Darling, don't talk.

39:17.491 --> 39:19.127
Don't talk.

39:29.850 --> 39:32.289
- Anything?
- I'm not sure.

39:35.127 --> 39:36.215
Captain!

39:39.258 --> 39:40.939
He's talking.

39:40.974 --> 39:42.994
He's talking?

39:43.240 --> 39:44.781
He's saying:

39:46.226 --> 39:48.234
"I love you."

39:48.269 --> 39:49.905
Over here! Over here!

39:49.940 --> 39:51.395
Get that backhoe over here now!

39:51.430 --> 39:52.800
Here! Here!

39:57.654 --> 39:58.569
Adrian.

39:59.452 --> 40:03.201
Adrian, listen. Listen,
they're digging.

40:03.236 --> 40:05.961
They're coming for you. Natalie must
have come back to look for you.

40:05.996 --> 40:07.907
That's how they knew
you were missing. - Yeah.

40:08.902 --> 40:11.673
Adrian, listen to me.
I want you to do something for me.

40:11.708 --> 40:15.180
I want you to close my office
and pay her what she needs.

40:15.215 --> 40:16.442
I can't... I can't close it.

40:16.477 --> 40:20.200
It's just four walls and a door.
It means nothing. - No.

40:20.235 --> 40:22.436
- Adrian, you have to go now.
- No, no.

40:22.471 --> 40:23.943
- Adrian, you have to go.
- Oh, no.

40:23.978 --> 40:25.516
You have to go.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.699
- No.
- I love you.

40:30.951 --> 40:32.992
I love you.

40:40.954 --> 40:42.596
He's breathing.
Get him some oxygen.

40:42.631 --> 40:45.638
Call Dr. Charles Kroger.
Tell him to meet us at the hospital.

40:46.581 --> 40:48.506
He's smiling.

40:49.046 --> 40:52.024
I've never seen him look happier.

40:58.924 --> 40:59.942
Well, I guess that's it.

41:01.338 --> 41:02.943
Oh, sir, sir, sir.

41:03.770 --> 41:06.741
- The thumb tacks?
- Yeah, we're takin' everything.

41:15.735 --> 41:17.247
Okay?

41:19.215 --> 41:20.280
Let's go.
