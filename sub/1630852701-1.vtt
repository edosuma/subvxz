A NETFLIX SERIES

02:51.250 --> 02:53.541
THE TEMPERATURE'S RISING

03:12.916 --> 03:14.291
CONDOMS

03:17.291 --> 03:18.791
You owe me 200 pesetas.

03:19.291 --> 03:22.000
How could I buy them
with Grandma Tina there, Eva?

03:23.208 --> 03:25.916
She's hooked on
that slot machine in my mom's bar.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
She's there all day.

03:32.625 --> 03:34.416
So, ten o'clock at the reservoir?

03:35.708 --> 03:36.708
Mar?

03:37.333 --> 03:40.625
-I'll swing by your house beforehand.
-No, I'll meet you there.

03:40.708 --> 03:42.958
I'm helping the clubs set up.

03:47.916 --> 03:49.958
Don't you think I look kinda ridiculous?

03:51.125 --> 03:53.916
My sister says I'm smiling
like one of Dr. Mengele's patients.

03:55.250 --> 03:57.250
So, you're listening to Sofía now?

04:17.416 --> 04:18.416
Sofía?

04:20.041 --> 04:21.041
Honey.

04:23.125 --> 04:25.333
What's this about you
not going to the bonfires?

04:26.291 --> 04:28.166
-Mom!
-What?

04:31.666 --> 04:33.750
Saint John's Eve is the same every year.

04:33.833 --> 04:36.625
Just people getting wasted
and making out at the reservoir.

04:37.666 --> 04:40.041
Is that what you want
for your teenage daughter?

04:40.875 --> 04:43.583
No. What I want for you is to have fun.

04:43.666 --> 04:45.291
And for me to get pregnant at 16?

04:49.916 --> 04:53.708
I made this new T-shirt.
It's really cute. Don't you wanna wear it?

04:56.958 --> 04:58.208
Okay, fine.

04:59.291 --> 05:00.583
By six.

05:00.666 --> 05:04.500
By three, Eva.
Your sister can't come back by herself.

05:04.583 --> 05:06.750
-But, Dad!
-Don't start with me.

05:06.833 --> 05:11.666
-Thanks, Sofía. Love you too.
-Yeah, I'm also dying to go with you.

05:11.750 --> 05:15.541
By five. If she wants
to leave earlier, walk her home. Period.

05:17.166 --> 05:18.083
Is Chisco going?

05:18.583 --> 05:22.375
Yeah, he wants to get
some shots for his movie, <i>Bloody Feria</i>.

05:22.458 --> 05:25.708
Elena, should I clear your plate?
You barely touched it.

05:25.791 --> 05:27.416
-Yeah.
-Bye.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.500
All right, let's hear it.

05:31.583 --> 05:33.625
Do I look like
I just escaped a Nazi nuthouse?

05:34.333 --> 05:36.458
I was gonna say you look really pretty.

05:36.541 --> 05:40.291
Though you do kinda seem
lady-of-the-Third-Reich-ish.

05:40.375 --> 05:43.333
-Dressed to kill.
-You're such a jerk.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.541
-Bye.
-Be careful, both of you.

05:48.625 --> 05:49.791
Can I get a kiss goodbye?

05:52.625 --> 05:54.125
-Stay together.
-Don't worry.

05:54.208 --> 05:56.916
-We'll be like two balls in a nutsack.
-You're so gross!

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Hey.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.000
You could've made
more of an effort to look nice.

06:01.083 --> 06:02.500
Yeah. Get off my back.

06:02.583 --> 06:04.666
-Shut up.
-Seriously, you're so annoying.

06:11.791 --> 06:13.041
Who are we going with?

06:14.166 --> 06:15.375
Everyone will be there.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.125
Raúl's coming too, obviously.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.833
They've gotta accept me.
I have the grades.

07:33.916 --> 07:37.750
-I wanna get out of here in September too.
-And go where?

07:37.833 --> 07:40.333
Seville. I'm sick of going
back and forth all the time.

07:40.416 --> 07:43.250
What are parents for
if not to pay my rent?

07:43.333 --> 07:46.125
I'll come visit
whenever I'm not working at the bar.

07:46.958 --> 07:49.875
I mean, sure,
if I still have room left in my bed.

07:50.583 --> 07:53.000
Who you gonna find
that has anything on me?

07:55.250 --> 07:56.416
I'm kidding.

07:57.916 --> 07:58.916
Raúl, it was a joke.

07:59.416 --> 08:01.333
-No, leave me alone.
-You're so dumb.

08:06.958 --> 08:08.291
<i>Summer kicks off.</i>

08:09.041 --> 08:10.125
<i>Saint John's Eve.</i>

08:10.625 --> 08:12.625
<i>The shortest night of the year.</i>

08:13.125 --> 08:15.791
Just a flash
in the minds of Feria's youth,

08:15.875 --> 08:18.833
oblivious to the danger that is lurking.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.875
<i>Bloody Feria </i>is about to begin.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.125
Who did that?

08:46.208 --> 08:48.000
-You basket case!
-Run!

08:48.083 --> 08:50.541
What did you do?
That's my dad's camcorder!

08:53.125 --> 08:55.333
Come on, Sofía! Run!

08:58.583 --> 09:00.458
-Run!
-Don't run so fast!

09:05.500 --> 09:07.208
You've gotta see it. It was dope.

09:10.416 --> 09:11.583
I didn't hit "Record."

09:14.666 --> 09:16.083
No way you're doing it again.

09:17.333 --> 09:19.208
The explosion was so sick.

09:19.291 --> 09:21.333
I had this shot of Rubio's face,

09:21.416 --> 09:24.333
looking like the guy in <i>Society</i>
when he discovers the truth.

09:24.833 --> 09:26.166
Pure terror, Sofía.

09:28.708 --> 09:30.125
Wanna take a dip?

09:36.541 --> 09:38.500
-I'm feeling better already.
-Wait. Mar!

09:41.166 --> 09:43.000
-Are you good?
-Yeah.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.708
Hey, what's up with you?

09:47.666 --> 09:49.916
You've been weird
ever since I told you I'm leaving.

09:53.750 --> 09:56.500
Sometimes I think you really are dumb.

09:58.458 --> 10:02.000
I'll let that slide
'cause you're drunk. But watch it.

10:02.791 --> 10:04.625
Yeah, I am drunk.

10:05.208 --> 10:06.833
Come on, Mar.

10:06.916 --> 10:08.458
You're shitfaced.

10:09.416 --> 10:10.291
Jeez.

10:35.041 --> 10:35.916
Eva?

10:37.750 --> 10:38.666
Raúl.

10:39.666 --> 10:41.916
Raúl, wait. Raúl.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.250
Have you seen Raúl?

11:06.833 --> 11:08.250
Gonna make me swim alone?

11:09.916 --> 11:11.166
You've been drinking.

11:33.416 --> 11:34.250
Chisco!

11:35.333 --> 11:39.041
Some douchebag dumped
a bike here. Come look.

12:45.708 --> 12:48.791
If I ask what happened last night,
will you tell me to fuck off?

12:48.875 --> 12:50.083
I should.

12:52.708 --> 12:54.666
But I don't have it in me this morning.

12:55.458 --> 12:57.625
You nearly gave Chisco a heart attack.

12:57.708 --> 13:00.708
You passed out in the water.
I have no idea why.

13:03.625 --> 13:05.291
What if he hadn't pulled you out?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.625
You really don't remember anything?

13:16.458 --> 13:20.041
It's your call, but if I were you,
I wouldn't tell Mom and Dad.

13:20.666 --> 13:21.875
Where are they?

13:24.833 --> 13:27.791
I don't know,
but they never let me sleep in this late.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.208
I'm taking a pill

13:30.500 --> 13:31.583
and going back to bed.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.291
<i>I am not your mother.</i>

13:45.875 --> 13:46.958
<i>Jesus, Bill.</i>

13:47.833 --> 13:49.291
<i>You never were one of us.</i>

13:51.500 --> 13:52.500
<i>Who are you?</i>

13:52.583 --> 13:54.791
<i>You have to be born in the society.</i>

13:56.083 --> 13:57.583
<i>Alien scum.</i>

13:57.666 --> 14:00.166
<i>No, we're not from outer space</i>
<i>or anything like that.</i>

14:00.250 --> 14:02.125
<i>We have been here</i>

14:03.375 --> 14:05.291
<i>as long as you have.</i>

14:05.375 --> 14:07.000
<i>It's a matter</i>

14:07.500 --> 14:08.708
<i>of good breeding, really</i>.

14:19.375 --> 14:20.583
Isn't it getting late?

14:20.666 --> 14:21.875
Goddammit, Raúl.

14:22.458 --> 14:23.916
Pick up the fucking phone.

14:24.625 --> 14:25.791
Where are Mom and Dad?

14:33.500 --> 14:36.125
Are you hungry?
I'm gonna make some cereal.

14:37.875 --> 14:39.041
I heard sirens.

14:41.166 --> 14:43.166
Since when do you hear sirens in Feria?

14:43.833 --> 14:45.416
I don't know, Sofía.

14:47.750 --> 14:49.708
Maybe they went shopping
and lost track of time.

15:01.166 --> 15:02.583
Civil Guard!

15:03.541 --> 15:05.333
On the ground!

15:05.416 --> 15:06.375
Freeze!

15:06.458 --> 15:07.833
-Eva!
-Don't move!

15:08.500 --> 15:09.791
Second floor, clear.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.458
-Stay still!
-Eva!

15:11.541 --> 15:12.750
-Sofía!
-No!

15:12.833 --> 15:13.791
Sofía!

15:13.875 --> 15:15.208
-Eva!
-Stay still!

15:15.291 --> 15:16.750
-Sofía!
-Let go of me!

15:16.833 --> 15:17.791
Let go of my sister!

15:20.750 --> 15:23.083
-Easy! Nothing's going to happen to you.
-Calm down.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.291
Easy.

15:28.125 --> 15:29.750
Please calm down, girls.

15:49.166 --> 15:50.625
Where are your parents?

15:54.250 --> 15:56.791
It's all right.
We just want to talk to them.

15:56.875 --> 15:57.916
Where are they?

16:00.833 --> 16:01.916
Marcos.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.333
Marcos, oh, thank God.

16:03.416 --> 16:04.458
What's happening?

16:05.416 --> 16:06.541
Tell them to leave.

16:07.583 --> 16:09.666
You should answer their questions.

16:19.208 --> 16:22.333
-Can I get you something to eat?
-Have you talked to our parents?

16:22.875 --> 16:24.375
Do they know we're here?

16:24.458 --> 16:26.833
You'll get an explanation soon.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.375
They're not from here.

16:35.041 --> 16:36.708
None of these cops are from Feria.

16:38.916 --> 16:39.916
Yes?

16:50.791 --> 16:52.833
Lieutenant Álvaro Guillén,
Central Operative Unit.

16:54.583 --> 16:57.083
Where the hell is there a chair?
Excuse me.

16:58.833 --> 17:01.666
Can someone find me a chair? Please.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.458
I just got to Feria this morning.

17:08.208 --> 17:12.250
Scary road in. One more bend,
and I wouldn't have made it.

17:14.208 --> 17:18.291
-I want to see my parents.
-Yes, I'd like to see them too, Eva.

17:18.375 --> 17:20.083
You are Eva, right?

17:21.750 --> 17:23.083
What happened to them?

17:25.250 --> 17:26.250
Thanks.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.750
Please, why don't you take a seat?

17:49.291 --> 17:50.291
Okay.

17:51.458 --> 17:52.666
This won't be easy.

17:53.875 --> 17:55.291
Actually, it's gonna fucking suck.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.750
You shouldn't have to go through this,
but there's nothing I can do.

17:59.500 --> 18:03.333
This morning, we got a call
from the Civil Guard in Feria at 6:25.

18:03.833 --> 18:08.083
Officer Leonardo Cuéllar
saw something at the old mine.

18:08.583 --> 18:10.916
Something that's hard to explain.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.500
Hello. Good morning.

18:35.041 --> 18:37.875
-Good morning.
-Officer Dorado, from Madrid.

18:39.458 --> 18:42.583
<i>Headquarters sent me here, to your town.</i>

18:42.666 --> 18:44.958
<i>I got in at around 7:30.</i>

18:45.708 --> 18:50.791
<i>As soon as we assessed the situation,</i>
<i>I closed down access to the old mine.</i>

18:51.583 --> 18:54.291
You're going to be the first
to hear what happened.

18:54.791 --> 18:57.041
Trust me, I'd rather not have to tell you.

20:03.416 --> 20:05.375
<i>Twenty-three bodies.</i>

20:05.458 --> 20:10.458
<i>The forensics team just arrived,</i>
<i>and we're working on identifying them now.</i>

20:11.750 --> 20:15.125
Don't worry. We checked,
and your parents weren't there.

20:18.458 --> 20:21.666
So, what happened to them?
If they're not dead and they're not there…

20:23.208 --> 20:25.166
When was the last time you saw them?

20:26.083 --> 20:28.833
Last night,
before we left for the bonfires.

20:28.916 --> 20:29.958
What time was that?

20:31.125 --> 20:32.333
I don't know.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.333
Around ten?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.083
Why aren't you telling us where they are?

20:37.166 --> 20:38.666
'Cause we don't know, Eva.

20:39.666 --> 20:41.583
There are 23 victims,
and we just got here.

20:42.166 --> 20:45.625
I'm trying to sort this out and understand
where these bodies came from

20:45.708 --> 20:47.291
before this turns into a circus.

20:47.833 --> 20:49.375
But you're looking for them?

20:50.208 --> 20:51.166
My parents.

20:51.666 --> 20:54.208
You stormed our house
like they were guilty of something.

20:57.375 --> 20:59.833
They might be able
to explain what happened there.

21:04.666 --> 21:08.166
The city council recently installed
a surveillance camera outside the mine.

21:08.250 --> 21:11.083
It's abandoned.
They were worried about trespassers.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.500
As soon as we saw the recording,
we went to your house.

21:17.458 --> 21:19.500
Taken at 1:07 a.m.

21:23.291 --> 21:24.833
Do you recognize her?

21:27.333 --> 21:28.333
Mom?

21:29.791 --> 21:31.208
What was she doing there?

21:31.875 --> 21:35.666
They all went into the gallery.
All of them… except for one.

21:45.333 --> 21:46.416
It's my father.

21:58.458 --> 22:00.958
Two hours and seventeen minutes later,

22:01.041 --> 22:02.625
at 3:24 a.m.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.000
Where's my mother?

22:17.208 --> 22:18.958
We don't know. She's not on the tape.

22:19.041 --> 22:22.000
What? What are you waiting for?
Go in the mine!

22:22.083 --> 22:23.708
-Calm down.
-What are you waiting for?

22:23.791 --> 22:26.416
-This is crazy!
-I need you to calm down. Please.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.416
Listen. We can't go inside.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.250
-Why?
-We can't, okay?

22:31.416 --> 22:34.833
Your father's a surveyor.
In 1975, he helped close the mine.

22:34.916 --> 22:37.041
Why did he let Elena and the others go in?

22:37.125 --> 22:39.625
He knew exactly what would happen to them.

22:40.666 --> 22:42.333
Why did he leave the mine?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.958
Where do you think he could be right now?

22:53.875 --> 22:55.708
Is my mother dead?

23:02.833 --> 23:03.958
Okay, listen up.

23:05.375 --> 23:07.750
I understand this is hard, okay?

23:08.625 --> 23:10.000
But you have to help me.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.041
You've seen the footage.

23:13.750 --> 23:17.416
Did your parents belong
to some sort of an organization?

23:17.500 --> 23:19.041
Did they attend any meetings?

23:19.541 --> 23:21.541
That doesn't sound
like our parents at all.

23:24.083 --> 23:27.166
My mother likes music and drawing.

23:27.958 --> 23:29.791
My dad likes soccer. He's a Betis fan.

23:29.875 --> 23:33.208
He snores because of his asthma.
I don't get what more you want us to say.

23:33.291 --> 23:35.916
It's all right. Really, don't worry, Eva.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.083
Sofía.

23:41.666 --> 23:46.083
Have you ever seen them with,
I don't know, anyone… odd?

23:46.666 --> 23:50.083
-Did they ever mention religion?
-We don't go to Mass.

23:51.791 --> 23:53.166
But why does that matter?

24:07.500 --> 24:10.291
What part of "don't let anyone in"
didn't you get?

24:10.375 --> 24:12.583
I'm sorry, but Father Ezcaray asked--

24:12.666 --> 24:15.166
People need someone
to tell them what's happening.

24:15.666 --> 24:17.291
You can't just close off the mine.

24:17.375 --> 24:21.791
Right. If I have to speak to anyone,
it'll be the mayor. Not the Church.

24:21.875 --> 24:23.833
You shouldn't see me as your enemy.

24:26.791 --> 24:27.875
Get him out of here.

24:33.625 --> 24:34.666
Sorry about that.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.458
The entrance is gonna be full of people.

24:38.958 --> 24:43.083
This is a small town…
Folks have never seen this many cops.

24:46.125 --> 24:47.791
They'll have to get used to it.

24:48.625 --> 24:51.416
And to the reporters too.
They'll be coming.

24:53.250 --> 24:56.208
-What is that building?
-The mine's old workshops.

25:03.375 --> 25:04.625
Methane pockets.

25:05.583 --> 25:07.291
That must've been what got 'em.

25:08.375 --> 25:12.125
Everyone knows you're risking your life
as soon as you walk inside.

25:12.833 --> 25:17.125
The air poisons you,
and you don't even realize you're dying.

25:17.208 --> 25:20.125
-So, why did they go in?
-I guess they wanted to end it.

25:20.208 --> 25:23.500
Instead of jumping off a bridge,
they just went into the mine.

25:29.791 --> 25:30.791
Was that a rat?

25:45.541 --> 25:47.291
Civil Guard! Who's there?

25:55.833 --> 25:57.000
We're coming in.

25:58.208 --> 26:00.291
Don't do anything stupid. You hear me?

26:29.791 --> 26:30.750
Freeze.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.250
Easy.

26:39.500 --> 26:40.375
Don't worry.

26:42.208 --> 26:43.291
We're gonna help you.

26:55.500 --> 26:58.333
EL SERVAL SHELTER

27:00.208 --> 27:02.083
-Estrella.
-Eva.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.208
If there's anything you need, let me know.

27:06.708 --> 27:07.708
Come with me.

27:08.291 --> 27:11.750
We got a room ready for you,
but we didn't have much time.

27:12.833 --> 27:14.125
It's nothing fancy,

27:14.625 --> 27:18.125
but at least
you can relax and get some rest.

27:24.791 --> 27:26.125
What is this, prison?

27:27.125 --> 27:29.916
No, nothing like that.
And it's just temporary.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.583
You don't have relatives in town.
This way, you won't be alone.

27:35.166 --> 27:38.083
Would you like a pill
to help you sleep? It could help.

27:38.583 --> 27:39.916
No, thanks, Estrella.

28:03.291 --> 28:04.541
Mom is dead.

28:13.541 --> 28:14.625
That's not true.

28:16.416 --> 28:19.291
She's in the mine,
and they're getting her out.

28:20.333 --> 28:21.500
No, Sofía.

28:22.791 --> 28:26.750
Nobody can survive in the mine that long.
The gas would kill you.

28:31.041 --> 28:33.666
My chest hurts. I can't breathe.

28:33.750 --> 28:34.791
Calm down.

28:36.041 --> 28:37.333
Eva, calm down.

28:38.291 --> 28:39.375
Breathe.

28:42.458 --> 28:43.458
Breathe.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.083
Remember Grandma Tina's dog?

28:48.583 --> 28:52.041
He went into the mine
and came out three days later.

28:52.625 --> 28:53.625
Remember?

28:54.208 --> 28:56.958
Like nothing happened. He was just fine.

28:58.041 --> 28:59.000
-Remember?
-Yeah.

28:59.083 --> 29:01.375
Grandma Tina's dumb dog.

29:02.333 --> 29:03.875
He was so ugly.

29:15.500 --> 29:18.291
CIVIL GUARD STATION

29:22.333 --> 29:23.166
Yes?

29:26.875 --> 29:29.166
The kid's ready for questioning.

29:29.250 --> 29:30.375
He have a name?

29:30.458 --> 29:33.500
-Won't say a word. Doesn't have ID either.
-Shit.

29:33.583 --> 29:38.041
We could really use a talker.
The last thing we need is another nutjob.

29:38.750 --> 29:42.708
-Anyone in town know what happened?
-Not yet.

29:45.375 --> 29:47.500
But they'll find out soon enough.

29:48.125 --> 29:50.041
The local cops will let it slip.

29:54.166 --> 29:55.333
How'd the girls take it?

29:55.416 --> 29:57.833
Like someone dropped a piano
on their heads.

29:59.791 --> 30:00.958
They must know something.

30:01.041 --> 30:03.333
I don't buy
that their folks kept them in the dark.

30:03.416 --> 30:06.708
There's no way. Their parents
did this stuff in front of them.

30:06.791 --> 30:07.750
What stuff?

30:07.833 --> 30:11.041
Going into the mine to worship
the devil or aliens from Alpha Centauri.

30:11.125 --> 30:12.166
How should I know?

30:12.250 --> 30:15.000
You've seen the video. That was a ritual.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.708
Not to mention those goddamn tattoos.

30:25.166 --> 30:27.500
I think I need
for those girls to know something.

30:28.833 --> 30:29.875
And that's why…

30:32.208 --> 30:34.625
They're just like we were at that age.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.291
No way, Guillén.

30:37.958 --> 30:39.708
They might have been.

30:40.458 --> 30:43.375
But nothing's ever gonna be the same.
Not for them or this town.

30:44.125 --> 30:45.833
Who can forget 23 dead people?

30:51.375 --> 30:52.375
Marcos!

30:53.083 --> 30:54.083
Tell the truth!

30:54.750 --> 30:57.291
All right, how many times
do I have to explain this?

30:57.375 --> 30:59.166
I'm not authorized, all right?

30:59.250 --> 31:00.250
What's going on, Ma?

31:00.333 --> 31:03.083
They won't leave your dad alone,
so we had to close.

31:07.166 --> 31:10.166
Go home, everyone.
We have to close the bar. Please.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.416
They're searching for Elena and Pablo.

31:18.500 --> 31:21.416
If you've seen them or have information,
go to the station, okay?

31:21.916 --> 31:23.791
I'm saying…

31:23.875 --> 31:26.916
-I said to go to the station.
-Listen, Marcos.

31:59.166 --> 32:01.458
How about we start
by introducing ourselves?

32:02.416 --> 32:04.375
My name is Guillén.

32:09.125 --> 32:11.083
That's fine. We'll skip the names.

32:14.875 --> 32:16.250
What were you doing at the mine?

32:17.833 --> 32:19.916
Why were you locked in that room?

32:21.583 --> 32:22.625
Nothing, huh?

32:33.375 --> 32:39.416
<i>Jesus came to ask for help</i>
<i>Standing at a rich man's door</i>

32:40.000 --> 32:44.541
<i>But no help would the rich man give</i>
<i>He sicced his dogs and did no more</i>

32:45.250 --> 32:47.541
At least we know you're not deaf.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.125
My name is Halid.

32:50.625 --> 32:51.583
Halid.

32:52.958 --> 32:54.541
I got no idea what happened.

32:55.041 --> 32:59.416
My brother said he found a job here.

32:59.958 --> 33:04.041
We got into town four days ago.
We were staying out in the forest.

33:04.125 --> 33:05.416
Where was home before?

33:05.500 --> 33:10.000
Ever since we left Sarajevo,
we haven't lived anywhere for long.

33:10.916 --> 33:13.750
We went to the mine at night.

33:14.250 --> 33:16.833
He was supposed to meet
the person who'd hired him,

33:16.916 --> 33:19.541
but… there were more people there.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.375
I don't know who they were.

33:23.083 --> 33:24.291
Was it these people?

33:25.833 --> 33:28.375
The ones who offered your brother the job.

33:31.916 --> 33:34.875
How do you know?
You just said you didn't know them.

33:34.958 --> 33:37.083
They were the ones in charge.

33:37.708 --> 33:38.875
In charge, how?

33:38.958 --> 33:42.208
She was the one
who told my brother I couldn't stay.

33:42.291 --> 33:44.041
That's why she locked me in there.

33:45.208 --> 33:46.291
What happened then?

33:47.750 --> 33:50.333
I thought I heard them…

33:51.250 --> 33:52.416
praying.

33:52.958 --> 33:53.958
I don't know.

33:54.875 --> 33:57.333
Not long after, everything went silent.

33:58.333 --> 34:01.666
I figured my brother
would come back sooner or later, but…

34:05.041 --> 34:06.333
but he never did.

36:57.333 --> 36:58.375
Sarge.

37:00.750 --> 37:01.791
Are you all right?

37:03.750 --> 37:06.166
What were you thinking, going inside?

37:06.250 --> 37:08.625
The air's toxic.
Do you want to end up like them?

37:12.375 --> 37:13.416
I'm fine.

37:15.291 --> 37:16.666
I was just lightheaded.

37:17.500 --> 37:18.833
I'm okay, really.

37:23.083 --> 37:25.916
In a few hours, we'll transfer the bodies.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.916
I'll lead the convoy, Fernando.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.333
Hold up a second. Excuse me.

37:41.125 --> 37:42.125
Sorry.

37:48.583 --> 37:50.375
Jesus Christ, Olga.

38:19.333 --> 38:21.041
I just had the worst dream.

38:23.416 --> 38:25.416
So, I'm at the beach, sunbathing,

38:26.250 --> 38:29.291
when suddenly my stomach
starts itching like crazy.

38:30.125 --> 38:34.208
But no matter how hard I scratch,
it keeps itching.

38:36.125 --> 38:40.291
Then I look and see something squirming.

38:40.833 --> 38:42.750
Like a cockroach under my skin.

38:45.250 --> 38:49.375
Then the bug starts crawling up,
past my chest, then to my neck.

38:49.916 --> 38:52.125
I'm freaking out, trying to stop it, but…

38:53.208 --> 38:54.958
So, I'm ripping at my skin.

38:56.708 --> 38:57.833
And I stop.

38:59.041 --> 39:01.250
Everyone on the beach is staring at me.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.375
Just this heap of blood and muscle.

39:13.666 --> 39:15.250
We didn't do anything wrong.

39:16.333 --> 39:18.041
Same goes for our parents.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.708
We don't know what they did, Sofía.

39:22.583 --> 39:24.166
We don't have a fucking clue.

39:25.708 --> 39:26.708
Come here.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.583
They found a lot of bodies at the mine.

39:42.666 --> 39:44.791
I'm so sorry, Pedro. Really.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.041
I wanted to tell you in person.

40:42.708 --> 40:43.708
What?

40:47.500 --> 40:50.583
Jeez. Did something die in here?
How about I open a window?

40:50.666 --> 40:52.750
Don't. I'm freezing.

40:58.083 --> 41:01.208
Perfect. Just what I needed.
For you to get sick.

41:07.791 --> 41:08.791
Let me see.

41:10.250 --> 41:12.333
Damn. You're burning up.

41:12.416 --> 41:14.208
-Want me to call a doctor?
-No.

41:14.875 --> 41:16.083
You get any sleep?

41:16.833 --> 41:20.250
Nope. If I had to bet,
I'd say the media will be arriving today

41:20.333 --> 41:23.541
and the Ministry of the Interior
will be calling to tear me a new one.

41:27.125 --> 41:28.250
What about the kid?

41:29.625 --> 41:31.250
Immigrant. No ID.

41:31.333 --> 41:33.958
It's odd that he just happened
to end up here.

41:34.708 --> 41:38.208
The way he puts it,
Pablo and Elena were the ones in charge.

41:38.708 --> 41:41.625
I sent him to the youth shelter.
I can't hold him.

41:48.541 --> 41:49.666
Get some rest.

41:51.083 --> 41:53.666
This won't be over anytime soon,
and I'll need your help.

41:54.708 --> 41:57.458
-Give me a shout if you need anything.
-Okay.

42:19.041 --> 42:21.500
The chopper's doing sweeps here.

42:21.583 --> 42:24.458
But if Pablo's hiding in the forest,
he won't be easy to find.

42:24.541 --> 42:25.875
More good news.

42:26.416 --> 42:28.750
Have any of the victims been ID'd?

42:29.750 --> 42:31.458
Just Olga Velázquez.

42:31.541 --> 42:34.500
What do we know about her?
Any connection to Pablo or Elena?

42:34.583 --> 42:35.541
Not that I know of.

42:35.625 --> 42:40.541
Olga is… <i>was </i>Pedro's wife.
He owns a video rental store in town.

42:41.041 --> 42:42.750
She disappeared three years ago.

42:43.250 --> 42:44.458
Heroin addict.

42:45.250 --> 42:48.208
She hasn't been missed, to be honest.
What can I say?

42:48.291 --> 42:51.333
Pedro and Chisco
were better off without her.

42:51.916 --> 42:54.083
Sounds like <i>you </i>didn't miss her.

42:56.458 --> 42:57.541
Lieutenant,

42:58.500 --> 43:01.166
I'm sure you know a lot more than I do.

43:01.250 --> 43:05.125
But not when it comes
to the people of Feria.

43:05.208 --> 43:06.250
If you get my drift.

43:06.791 --> 43:10.125
Then how is it possible
that in a town of what,

43:10.208 --> 43:11.541
2,000 people,

43:11.625 --> 43:14.500
nobody has any idea
where 23 bodies came from?

43:16.250 --> 43:19.125
I'm not blaming you.
I'm asking for advice.

43:19.666 --> 43:21.458
Nobody knows Feria like you, right?

43:22.291 --> 43:23.833
I gotta go get the girls.

43:29.833 --> 43:31.791
I'm so sorry, Pedro.

43:34.291 --> 43:35.583
CALIFORNIA VIDEO

43:35.666 --> 43:37.958
-If there's anything you need…
-I know, Candela.

43:38.041 --> 43:40.625
-I appreciate it.
-It was Elena.

43:40.708 --> 43:42.166
They said so on TV.

43:43.083 --> 43:44.708
Those girls should talk.

43:44.791 --> 43:47.208
-They had to be involved.
-It's inconceivable.

43:47.291 --> 43:51.208
What kind of world is this
where folks kill themselves for blasphemy?

43:51.291 --> 43:54.833
-Olga wasn't religious.
-This wasn't about religion, Pedro.

43:55.583 --> 43:56.958
This was an atrocity.

43:57.875 --> 44:01.583
-Have you been in the mine yet?
-We're waiting on the specialists.

44:01.666 --> 44:03.583
We're moving as fast as we can.

44:11.208 --> 44:12.041
What's going on?

44:14.958 --> 44:16.666
Olga, Chisco's mother.

44:17.458 --> 44:19.166
She was one of the victims from the mine.

44:25.750 --> 44:27.458
Go through the square instead.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.666
You can grab backpacks from your rooms.

44:57.750 --> 44:59.666
We'll send the rest later.

45:00.208 --> 45:01.208
What?

45:02.666 --> 45:03.708
We can't stay at home?

45:04.541 --> 45:07.166
We're moving you to a facility in Seville.

45:07.250 --> 45:10.291
-Just until things get sorted out.
-I'm not leaving Feria.

45:10.791 --> 45:12.833
How do you think folks are going to react?

45:13.583 --> 45:14.666
It's for your own good.

45:14.750 --> 45:16.583
You expect me to buy that?

45:17.541 --> 45:20.416
Just like you're doing
everything you can to save my mom, right?

45:21.125 --> 45:23.333
-What do you think I am, stupid?
-Sofía.

45:29.625 --> 45:30.791
<i>They're just kids.</i>

45:30.875 --> 45:34.000
They're all alone
and have no idea what happened.

45:34.083 --> 45:36.333
They're talking about
Pablo and Elena on the news.

45:36.416 --> 45:40.083
Accusing them of inciting suicide.
This fire's already out of control.

45:40.625 --> 45:45.000
Soon they'll be saying
they held satanic orgies at home.

45:45.083 --> 45:46.291
Then who knows what else.

45:47.333 --> 45:49.541
Why do you think
I want the girls out of here?

45:53.041 --> 45:55.833
Lieutenant,
you better take a look at this.

45:58.666 --> 46:02.625
An officer found
these letters in your parents' room.

46:03.416 --> 46:05.791
On the shelf inside the closet.

46:06.583 --> 46:08.083
Have you seen them before?

46:13.000 --> 46:15.333
They're all addressed to Elena Vera.

46:15.416 --> 46:19.541
Some are from three years ago.
Others were sent last month.

46:20.125 --> 46:23.958
They're letters from members
of a group called the Cult of Light.

46:24.041 --> 46:26.333
"We continue on our path of perfection

46:26.416 --> 46:28.250
to become like you, Elena."

46:29.833 --> 46:33.541
"We've completed the five veils of light,
and you are the key."

46:33.625 --> 46:34.791
Then there are pages

46:34.875 --> 46:37.500
about the Region of Shadows
and the Cult of Light.

46:37.583 --> 46:41.416
It's enough to give you a headache.
Does this make any sense to you?

46:41.500 --> 46:42.916
I don't understand a thing.

46:44.666 --> 46:48.375
It's signed by someone named…
Suzanne Madèline,

46:48.916 --> 46:50.708
daughter of the Cult of Light.

46:51.500 --> 46:55.833
I believe that she and, well,
the other people who sent these letters

46:56.875 --> 46:59.291
might be the ones we found at the mine.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.416
So, what were our parents?
Some kind of crackpot cult leaders?

47:04.500 --> 47:08.166
You're not responsible
for what Pablo and Elena did.

47:08.833 --> 47:10.625
You don't have to protect them.

47:10.708 --> 47:11.583
It was them.

47:11.666 --> 47:12.625
Listen to me.

47:12.708 --> 47:15.208
I still don't know
how your father fits into this,

47:15.291 --> 47:18.416
but I do know Elena was in charge.

47:18.500 --> 47:22.291
She convinced those people to take
their own lives by going into the mine.

47:22.375 --> 47:23.583
That's not true.

47:24.291 --> 47:26.875
I know this hurts, Sofía. Okay?

47:27.416 --> 47:30.958
But think about the families
of those 23 people who died.

47:31.041 --> 47:34.708
They're hurting just as much as you are.
You need to help us.

47:35.791 --> 47:37.500
Then let us stay in town.

47:41.250 --> 47:43.708
You can stay
at the shelter for a few days.

47:44.291 --> 47:46.708
There's no need to rush the transfer.

48:35.666 --> 48:39.083
FIFTH VEIL

48:39.166 --> 48:42.458
CULT OF LIGHT

48:46.375 --> 48:48.041
<i>They were the ones in charge.</i>

48:48.750 --> 48:52.125
<i>She was the one</i>
<i>who told my brother I couldn't stay.</i>

48:52.208 --> 48:53.750
<i>That's why she locked me in there.</i>

48:54.541 --> 48:56.958
<i>Not long after, everything went silent.</i>

48:57.958 --> 49:01.250
<i>I figured my brother</i>
<i>would come back sooner or later, but</i>…

49:02.208 --> 49:03.625
<i>but he never did.</i>

49:04.375 --> 49:05.958
EL SERVAL SHELTER

49:06.041 --> 49:07.500
You're talking about Mom and Dad.

49:08.583 --> 49:09.958
Do you actually believe it?

49:13.291 --> 49:14.208
Look at me!

49:15.500 --> 49:16.500
Look at me.

49:18.833 --> 49:21.541
You think they made
those people kill themselves?

49:21.625 --> 49:23.166
Then where's Dad?

49:25.500 --> 49:28.208
If there was any other explanation,
he'd be with us.

49:28.291 --> 49:30.250
But no. They left us here alone.

49:35.333 --> 49:36.333
Sofía.

49:37.791 --> 49:38.916
Listen to me.

49:39.416 --> 49:41.458
I'm just trying to look after you.

49:43.916 --> 49:45.666
I'm not a child.

49:48.791 --> 49:50.583
Yesterday you almost drowned.

49:54.666 --> 49:56.625
So don't tell me
you know what you're doing.

50:00.625 --> 50:02.416
I don't get how you don't remember.

51:18.583 --> 51:19.833
Mom?

51:38.333 --> 51:39.333
Sofía…

51:39.916 --> 51:41.208
Sofía, get out of here!

51:41.875 --> 51:42.708
Go!

51:43.375 --> 51:44.291
What?

51:45.083 --> 51:46.208
This isn't real.

51:46.708 --> 51:47.541
Leave!

51:49.958 --> 51:52.000
Maybe I didn't want him to pull me out.

52:03.625 --> 52:05.625
So, you'd have rather died there?

52:07.250 --> 52:08.750
Sofía, you're scaring me.

52:12.291 --> 52:14.125
There's something we don't understand.

52:17.458 --> 52:18.666
I don't know what it is.

52:22.833 --> 52:24.000
But there's something.

55:08.500 --> 55:11.416
