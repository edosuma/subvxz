00:01.000 --> 00:02.650
Previously on Grimm...

00:06.240 --> 00:07.685
I keep thinking about Adalind.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.842
She lost her powers
and then got them back.

00:09.920 --> 00:12.844
So, so does that mean that you don't
have to be born a Hexenbiest,

00:12.920 --> 00:14.206
you could become one?

00:14.360 --> 00:16.283
What's wrong?
Just tell me.

00:25.440 --> 00:29.286
"He felt now that he was
not simply close to her,

00:29.400 --> 00:33.928
but that he did not know
where he ended and she began."

00:50.080 --> 00:51.366
This is great.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.644
If I were a ghost, I'd live here.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.007
This week on
Ghost Seekers...

00:58.640 --> 01:00.802
We find ourselves
outside the Donovan House.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.881
Tragedy literally
struck here five years ago,

01:04.000 --> 01:06.321
when Stetson Donovan
and his wife, Patty,

01:06.400 --> 01:08.721
were found dead in
each other's arms,

01:08.800 --> 01:11.531
killed by a massive
jolt of electricity.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.243
Paul, get a little closer.
Yeah, that's good.

01:17.480 --> 01:23.249
Skulls cracked, teeth literally
shattered, eyes literally blown out.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.246
Nasty stuff.

01:26.080 --> 01:29.482
Legend has it, the husband's
ghost roams here at night,

01:29.560 --> 01:32.609
mourning his soul mate,
unable to pass on,

01:32.960 --> 01:37.010
while their killer, having
never been found, walks free.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.364
No justice, no peace indeed.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.528
Really,
you're gonna say that?

01:42.600 --> 01:45.251
He just did.
We'll cut around it.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.529
Let's get inside,
it's getting cold.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.048
I don't think it's gonna
be any warmer in there.

02:00.640 --> 02:01.801
Juliette?

02:02.080 --> 02:07.610
Monroe and Rosalee are finally on
their way to post-marital bliss.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.889
Juliette, you home?

02:20.640 --> 02:21.971
Where are you?

02:28.160 --> 02:29.491
And you're not
answering your phone.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.005
Hi, you've reached Juliette.
Leave a message.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.924
Hey, call me when
you get this, I'm home.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.925
Oh, my God.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.360
How did this happen?

02:45.360 --> 02:46.600
I don't know.

02:46.680 --> 02:47.966
Your mother said
that there might be

02:48.040 --> 02:49.485
side effects when
she gave me the potion

02:49.560 --> 02:50.607
and I turned
into Adalind

02:50.680 --> 02:53.524
and then I slept with Nick so that
he could get his powers back.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.682
Do you call
this a side effect?

02:57.760 --> 02:58.727
How long have
you been like this?

02:58.800 --> 03:00.689
It started the night
Monroe was kidnapped.

03:00.760 --> 03:03.730
All I wanna know is,
how do I get rid of it?

03:04.480 --> 03:06.767
I don't know. This might take
some time to figure out.

03:06.840 --> 03:07.841
How much?

03:07.920 --> 03:09.524
Juliette, I'm not exactly
an expert in these things.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.763
Well, your mother is, she did this
to me, she'll reverse it. Call her.

03:14.200 --> 03:17.170
Now! Please.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.725
Please,  help me.

03:44.440 --> 03:45.965
I got a feeling
about this place.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.964
I know what you mean.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.244
I don't think we're
the only ones here.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.611
Remember,
no matter what happens,

03:56.680 --> 03:59.365
whatever we see,
no matter how horrific,

03:59.480 --> 04:01.403
we will not stop shooting it.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.482
That's the Ghost Seeker
guarantee.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.444
The scene of this
gruesome double murder

04:13.520 --> 04:15.921
took place upstairs
in the master bedroom.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.521
The most likely place
to find Donovan's ghost.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.967
And the place most
likely for me to go.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.170
Knowing what dangers lurk,

04:28.240 --> 04:31.050
he bravely soldiers up
the creaky old staircase.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.561
We're
cutting that for sure!

04:38.720 --> 04:40.006
I've removed my EMF meter

04:40.080 --> 04:42.811
which measures the electro-magnetic
field and anomalies therein.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.169
If there is an additional presence,
this baby should pick it up.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.682
And as you can see, there's
nothing here right now...

04:50.760 --> 04:52.205
Oh, God!

04:54.360 --> 04:56.408
Definitely
cutting around that.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.760
Whoa!

05:02.840 --> 05:04.490
That's a first.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.523
If there's literally
a ghost in that room,

05:08.400 --> 05:13.406
and my EMF meter is telling the
truth, we're in for a wild ride.

05:28.680 --> 05:29.806
CAROL; Whoa!

05:38.960 --> 05:39.961
Paul!

05:40.960 --> 05:42.007
Paul, get over here!

05:44.440 --> 05:46.363
What's up?
I think I got something.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.010
Whoa.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.131
It's in the red.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.450
The meter's never
been in the red.

05:52.840 --> 05:56.242
The ceiling lights, did you see them?
They turned on and off.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.769
Come on, Carol. There's
no power in this house.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.282
I know, Paul,
that's why it's weird.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.366
You saying it's him,
he's here?

06:06.760 --> 06:08.285
We're finally
gonna see one.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.722
I'm in the room
where it all went down.

06:19.320 --> 06:21.687
The Donovan's were
found right here.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.801
The scorch marks
are still there.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.970
Look at that.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.608
Oh, I definitely
feel a presence.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.361
What?

06:36.200 --> 06:37.804
Oh, wow.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.080
You
don't think I tried that?

06:43.880 --> 06:44.927
Look behind you.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.251
Is it him?

06:48.320 --> 06:50.243
Just look.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.851
Crap, my scanner.
Paul, are you getting this?

06:59.560 --> 07:03.167
There is literally no logical
explanation for what we're seeing.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.881
The fan seems to be turning
under its own power.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.520
As you can see, the window's
closed, so it can't...

07:09.080 --> 07:10.923
What the hell is that?

07:12.520 --> 07:13.885
Ahhh!

07:16.920 --> 07:18.251
Raymond!

07:19.360 --> 07:21.044
Ray! Ray!

08:07.040 --> 08:08.724
- Juliette?
- Yeah?

08:10.240 --> 08:11.924
I'm sorry I'm late.
I picked up some...

08:12.720 --> 08:13.720
Oh, you already ate.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.366
Yeah, I called. Twice.

08:16.440 --> 08:19.569
I'm sorry, my phone must
have been buried in my bag.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.248
Did Monroe and Rosalee
get away this time?

08:23.280 --> 08:26.011
Yeah.
We made sure of that.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.524
Hey, maybe we should think
about getting away.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.325
Yeah, that could be nice.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.688
Are you okay?
Of course.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.880
Things have just been
a little intense lately.

08:41.919 --> 08:46.528
But everything's gonna
get back to normal now.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.331
I know what you are.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.045
Sean.
What did you find out?

10:05.120 --> 10:06.451
Found someone
you can talk to.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.285
I don't need a therapist.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.362
This is not
a therapist, believe me.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.521
Can he help me?

10:12.320 --> 10:13.526
It's not a he.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.604
And she doesn't
talk to just anyone.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.806
When can I see her?

10:16.880 --> 10:19.406
If she agrees to this, I'll make
it happen as soon as I can.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.364
Meet me at Cafe Nell at 1:00.
I should know more by then.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.410
Remember
the old Donovan house?

10:31.760 --> 10:33.967
Yeah,
supposed to be haunted.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.927
Double homicide, if I remember right.
You do.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.163
And in the land of the weird,
we've gone over the edge.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.806
You all right? You getting any sleep?
Not enough.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.769
You said I could go to the
trailer anytime I needed to.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.002
Well, last night
I needed to.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.401
Body's inside.

10:52.720 --> 10:56.247
Victim is Raymond Miller,
a ghost hunter.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.561
So,

11:02.560 --> 11:05.404
this what you meant
by "over the edge."

11:06.400 --> 11:07.731
This is the ghost hunter?

11:07.800 --> 11:09.962
Oh, yeah.
Ghost seekers.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.086
They have business cards.
Based in Seattle.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.561
NICK; God!

11:18.320 --> 11:20.004
Looks like he was
struck by lightning.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.411
More than once.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.007
What could've done this?

11:23.080 --> 11:24.605
Besides the lightning?
Beats me.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.321
Who called it in?

11:26.400 --> 11:28.721
The other two
ghost seekers.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.687
Both swear he was killed
by the ghost they were after.

11:31.760 --> 11:34.127
They said his body came
flying down the stairs.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.131
Well, let's see
what's upstairs.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.640
A camera?

11:55.720 --> 11:57.404
It used to be a camera.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.961
You don't suppose he could
have recorded his own death?

12:01.040 --> 12:03.611
Maybe, if I can salvage
the memory card.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.325
Let's talk
to the other two.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.880
We've been doing the Ghost
Seekers web series about a year now.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.527
We came across the Donovan's
house a few months ago.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.480
We felt like we'd
really found something.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.804
Raymond was so excited.

12:19.120 --> 12:23.569
This whole thing, our ghost
hunting, it was his passion.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.489
But to see what
it did to Raymond.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.326
The way that he...

12:29.000 --> 12:30.126
You know...

12:30.200 --> 12:31.850
It was just like
the legend.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.764
You mean
the double homicide.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.002
Yeah, the Donovans,
they died in bed together.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.445
They were
electrified to death.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.726
Just like Raymond.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.641
They say the dead husband's
ghost still haunts this place,

12:41.920 --> 12:43.046
killing people
the same way

12:43.120 --> 12:45.009
he and his soul mate
were killed five years ago.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.208
I know we say
we're ghost hunters,

12:47.800 --> 12:50.000
but you don't think you'll
actually run into this stuff.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.085
God, the way he screamed!

12:53.560 --> 12:56.325
I'm telling you, Raymond
was killed by a ghost,

12:56.400 --> 12:57.447
and we're gonna find it.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.202
We're not letting
our friend die in vain.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.530
We're sorry for your loss, but
this is an open investigation.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.444
Let us figure out
what killed Raymond.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.401
Whoa!

13:34.680 --> 13:35.886
Hey!

13:37.640 --> 13:39.369
Hey! Didn't you see me?

13:39.880 --> 13:41.564
You almost ran me over!

13:42.280 --> 13:43.566
Hey, I'm talking to you!

13:43.640 --> 13:45.927
I'm busy, lady.
You seem fine to me.

13:56.520 --> 13:57.760
My Car!

13:59.040 --> 14:00.804
What the hell
happened to my car?

14:06.080 --> 14:07.320
Time for lunch.

14:07.760 --> 14:10.366
Did I do that?
I didn't do that. Did I?

14:10.440 --> 14:11.771
I believe you did.

14:18.320 --> 14:21.483
Unis have been called to the
Donovan house a hell of a lot of times.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.807
Neighbors
reported strange lights,

14:24.880 --> 14:27.121
sounds coming from inside
the house at night.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.451
But every time the cops
arrived, place was empty.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.363
No wonder they
stopped responding.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.130
With no living heirs,
the bank seized

14:34.200 --> 14:36.089
control of the house
five years ago.

14:36.760 --> 14:38.125
It's still up for sale.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.130
Patty and Stetson Donovan.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.286
Young, attractive,
successful.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.687
They looked happy.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.046
Not so much here.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.642
Well, that looks a whole lot
like what happened to Raymond.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.882
Shattered skull,
no teeth, eyes blown out.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.764
Same MO. Same killer?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.120
Unless there's
more than one.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.486
Who worked the case?

15:06.840 --> 15:08.968
Detective Mark Wilson
had the lead on it.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.008
Is he still in Portland?
I think so.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.640
Let's see if we can invite
him down here for coffee.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.365
Her name's Henrietta.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.360
Is she related to you?

15:18.440 --> 15:19.646
No.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.720
She's known my mother
since she was a child.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.280
She's one of the main reasons my
mother brought us to Portland.

15:24.360 --> 15:25.361
How old is she?

15:26.840 --> 15:29.241
I don't know.
No one ever told me.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.004
And I'm not about to ask.
You shouldn't either.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.082
So how is she gonna
be able to help me?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.645
She won't know
until she meets you.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.770
Now, she might ask you
to do certain things.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.285
Like what?

15:38.920 --> 15:41.400
Sort of an evaluation.
To see what you're made of.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.885
When do I meet her?

15:44.760 --> 15:46.330
Call this number.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.280
Memorize it.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.089
I will.
Now.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.762
Got it.
Good.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.521
How did you do that?

16:05.280 --> 16:06.281
I didn't.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.848
Did I?
No.

16:11.520 --> 16:12.885
Henrietta.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.761
Oh.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.524
How did you ID the bodies?

16:18.240 --> 16:20.049
The report says they
were unrecognizable.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.528
Techs had very little
to work with.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.166
Couldn't even
get dental records

16:24.240 --> 16:27.130
because of the way the skulls
and the teeth were shattered.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.449
But the victims
were in their home,

16:29.520 --> 16:32.000
and their wedding rings
were melted to their fingers.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.802
The way those
bodies were scorched,

16:35.080 --> 16:37.162
forensics said it had
to have been caused by

16:37.240 --> 16:39.447
over 200,000 amperes
of electricity.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.329
That's quite a jolt.
Yeah.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.845
But that's not
the weirdest part.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.888
The rest of the room
was untouched.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.925
Only their bodies
and the mattress

16:48.000 --> 16:49.729
they were found on
were damaged.

16:50.080 --> 16:53.084
Like the killer had one hell
of a monster taser.

16:53.560 --> 16:56.643
Look, I worked a long time, I never
heard of that kind of weapon.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.922
Well, any chance it
was a robbery gone bad?

17:00.200 --> 17:02.885
Eh, nothing was taken. There was
still cash in Stetson's wallet,

17:03.000 --> 17:06.049
found on the floor in his pants pocket.
No signs of forced entry.

17:06.119 --> 17:08.691
So you went with a
love triangle gone south?

17:08.760 --> 17:10.887
During the investigation,
we learned Patty Donovan

17:10.960 --> 17:14.601
was having an affair with her
husband's co-worker, Theo Hinkley.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.769
Well, Theo probably thought Patty
was gonna leave Stetson for him.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.808
But Patty decided not to,

17:19.880 --> 17:22.611
so, Theo figured if he couldn't
have her, no one could.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.448
Shakespearean, ain't it?

17:26.280 --> 17:28.965
You speak with any of the
suspect's friends or family?

17:29.680 --> 17:32.206
Spoke to Theo's
wife a few times.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.005
Lily I think was her name.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.367
But she was just angry.
Couldn't blame her.

17:37.480 --> 17:38.811
You know where
Theo's wife is now?

17:38.880 --> 17:40.166
No clue.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.765
Her last known
is in the file.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.121
You guys ever figure out
how this happened,

17:45.200 --> 17:46.645
be sure and let me know.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.001
What are you reading?

19:24.080 --> 19:25.320
A book.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.168
Can we call that
enough small talk?

19:33.800 --> 19:35.211
That doesn't sound good.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.890
I'm just really tired.

19:38.760 --> 19:39.841
Oh.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.921
Okay.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.761
It's no big deal.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.124
Don't be mad.
I'm not mad.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.524
I'm fine, it's okay.

19:52.760 --> 19:53.761
Good night.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.646
Love you.

19:56.720 --> 19:57.801
I love you, too.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.407
You know what I wish?

20:16.480 --> 20:17.766
What?

20:19.640 --> 20:21.961
I wish we could go
on our honeymoon again.

20:23.720 --> 20:24.721
Why?

20:26.320 --> 20:27.880
'Cause we were
so much in love.

20:28.840 --> 20:31.446
What?
We're not in love now?

20:31.520 --> 20:34.171
No, I'm just
saying that I miss that.

20:34.440 --> 20:37.046
When it was just you and me.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.123
It's our song.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.364
Stetson, you said you'd dance
with me every time we heard it.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.048
Grabbed a little
breakfast, did some yoga.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.168
Man, they have
great yoga here.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.287
Rosalee, how's the room?

21:28.360 --> 21:29.486
Amazing.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.045
We are right
over the water.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.282
There's a trap door in
the middle of our floor,

21:33.360 --> 21:35.408
where you just dive
right into the ocean.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.726
It's paradise!

21:36.880 --> 21:40.407
I signed us up for some scuba diving
later, maybe a hike tomorrow.

21:42.560 --> 21:43.641
We miss you guys.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.360
Yeah, but we're glad
that you're not here.

21:45.640 --> 21:46.641
Wait.
Why?

21:46.720 --> 21:47.926
What's going on?
What's wrong?

21:48.080 --> 21:50.924
No, nothing. We're just happy that
you finally went on your honeymoon.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.487
Okay.

21:52.760 --> 21:55.730
It's good, 'cause you had me
worried there for a second.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.800
Juliette, have you had
anymore of those headaches?

21:58.480 --> 22:00.084
No, not so much.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.162
But quit wasting your beach
time on us, all right?

22:02.240 --> 22:03.924
We love you.
Have a great time.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.607
Oh, we are.
We love you, too.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.007
But if something should come up...
No, wait. Bye!

22:10.280 --> 22:13.204
Well, I have to head in.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.650
I guess I will
see you later.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.401
Yeah. How long?

22:24.920 --> 22:25.967
Yeah, okay.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.922
Got it. Thanks.

22:30.760 --> 22:34.048
Lily Hinkley moved three years
ago, left no forwarding.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.283
But the landlord knows where she works.
The Overlook Restaurant.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.602
I guess we need to find
her work schedule then.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.042
You know how sometimes
you guys forget

22:42.120 --> 22:44.122
what an invaluable
member of the force I am?

22:44.200 --> 22:45.201
Who is this guy?

22:45.280 --> 22:46.281
I have no idea.

22:46.360 --> 22:49.011
So, maybe then, you don't want to
know what I was able to salvage

22:49.440 --> 22:51.568
from the victim's
somewhat melted camera.

22:51.800 --> 22:52.801
You got something?

22:52.880 --> 22:53.961
I believe I do.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.848
I'm in the room
where it all went down.

23:04.440 --> 23:06.442
The Donovans were
found right here.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.124
The scorch marks
are still there.

23:10.960 --> 23:12.689
I definitely feel a presence.

23:13.320 --> 23:14.606
What the hell is that?

23:14.680 --> 23:15.727
Ahhh!

23:15.800 --> 23:17.882
The camera
melted down here.

23:22.880 --> 23:23.927
Whoa.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.283
Wesen, right?

23:27.440 --> 23:29.363
I mean, we're not
looking at a ghost.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.605
Guys?
I don't know.

23:31.720 --> 23:34.246
Because, and I don't want to
jump to conclusions or anything,

23:34.320 --> 23:36.288
but this looks kind of like
one of the sketches

23:36.360 --> 23:37.850
I saw in the trailer
the other night.

23:39.120 --> 23:40.690
Do you remember what it was?
Yes.

23:40.800 --> 23:41.801
No.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.321
Sort of.

23:43.480 --> 23:46.006
Ah, it was a Meta...

23:47.120 --> 23:49.009
Muto... Mata something.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.524
I'm not even sure
it's the same thing.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.364
I mean, this is
pretty blurry after all.

23:54.440 --> 23:55.521
Fair enough.

23:55.840 --> 23:57.569
Can you print us
a copy of this image?

23:57.640 --> 23:58.721
Yes, I can.

24:00.840 --> 24:01.960
You think
this is our killer?

24:02.240 --> 24:05.961
Given that the shot was taken just
before Raymond was murdered, yes.

24:06.040 --> 24:09.681
But the question is, is this Theo Hinkley?
The meta-mata whatever.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.124
Theo was married to Lily.

24:12.520 --> 24:15.410
If this is Theo,
she knows what he is.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.405
So, when we talk to her
we should be polite.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.207
How's that?

24:22.560 --> 24:23.607
It's fine.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.720
Why don't you come
with us on this one?

24:28.320 --> 24:29.401
I'm in.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.323
It was assumed
that your husband, Theo,

24:53.400 --> 24:55.243
killed Patty and
Stetson Donovan.

24:55.880 --> 24:58.451
Look, I went over
this a lot.

24:58.720 --> 25:01.041
It was years ago.
Why do you care now?

25:01.760 --> 25:04.445
Murder is murder. There is
no statute of limitations.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.170
We have a murder at
the Donovan house.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.564
Two nights ago.
The Donovan house?

25:10.120 --> 25:11.929
You ever hear anything
about it being haunted?

25:12.160 --> 25:13.685
Yeah, sure.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.444
I believe in ghosts,
don't you?

25:16.800 --> 25:18.768
We think Theo may
be back in town.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.171
My husband?

25:21.240 --> 25:22.241
I don't think so.

25:23.720 --> 25:24.767
Show her.

25:27.400 --> 25:30.324
This was taken by the victim
just before he became a victim.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.600
What is this
supposed to prove?

25:35.640 --> 25:36.801
Your husband's Wesen.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.120
Why don't you tell us
what we're dealing with?

25:38.240 --> 25:39.924
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:40.360 --> 25:42.601
Look, I gotta
get back to work.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.888
Lily, I need your help.

25:47.440 --> 25:49.480
I need to know what we're dealing with.
I'm a Grimm.

25:51.520 --> 25:54.364
It's all right,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.686
What's going on?

25:55.760 --> 25:57.046
Wesen.

25:57.680 --> 25:58.727
You sure?

25:58.800 --> 26:00.006
Pretty sure.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.088
When they get all freaked out
and try to get away,

26:02.160 --> 26:03.400
that's usually
what it means.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.527
Gotcha.

26:06.320 --> 26:07.970
You didn't see
anything, did you?

26:08.040 --> 26:09.644
No. Come on.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.928
I need to know what
happened five years ago.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.490
I'll tell you
what happened.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.923
Theo was having
an affair with Patty.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.841
I told Stetson so that
he would get her

26:19.920 --> 26:22.161
to break it off
with Theo and instead

26:23.640 --> 26:25.051
he killed them both,

26:25.520 --> 26:26.521
his own wife,

26:27.000 --> 26:28.001
my husband.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.683
He destroyed my family.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.080
Why didn't you tell the
detectives five years ago?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.287
Do they know what
we're talking about?

26:37.360 --> 26:38.407
We do.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.690
How was I supposed
to explain any of this

26:41.760 --> 26:43.360
without getting thrown
into a psych ward?

26:43.680 --> 26:45.921
That my husband couldn't have
done it because unlike Stetson,

26:46.040 --> 26:48.042
he couldn't
electrocute people?

26:49.680 --> 26:51.205
This is Stetson.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.445
Theo was a Scharfblicke,

26:56.520 --> 26:57.521
like me.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.563
That's how I know
he didn't kill 'em.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.691
He couldn't have.

27:04.360 --> 27:05.930
Not like this.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.123
What kind of Wesen
are we dealing with?

27:09.840 --> 27:12.411
A Matanga Zumbido.

27:13.560 --> 27:16.689
I told you it was
a Mata-something. I was close.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.489
And if I had known
what he was

27:18.560 --> 27:20.449
before I told him
about Theo and Patty,

27:23.640 --> 27:25.244
I never would have told him.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.041
I'm not going
back in that house.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.366
Something killed Raymond.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.408
Yeah, something did!

27:31.600 --> 27:33.170
That's why we're not going
back in that house.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.440
I'm not leaving Portland until
I find out what did this.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.691
We're ghost seekers, It's
what we're supposed to do.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.325
I never thought any of
this was really real.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.164
Well, now we have
proof that it is.

27:42.240 --> 27:43.321
And you want to run away.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.243
Yes, I do.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.091
Well, I'm not running.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.400
I'm gonna prove
this is real.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.686
Hello, Juliette.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.201
Henrietta?

28:25.280 --> 28:27.647
I'm very much looking forward
to meeting you.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.965
The address is 1118,
Old Stable Drive.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.966
Remember it.

28:33.480 --> 28:34.970
I'll see you later tonight.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.644
Wait, what time?

28:37.200 --> 28:38.201
You'll know.

28:48.640 --> 28:49.846
Whose car is that?

28:49.920 --> 28:51.160
Juliette's.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.361
You expecting her?

28:52.800 --> 28:53.801
Nope.

28:53.880 --> 28:55.803
Hope there's not a problem.

28:57.720 --> 28:58.721
You scared me.

29:00.480 --> 29:01.481
Everything okay?

29:02.480 --> 29:04.244
Yeah, you know, now that you're
back, and Trubel's gone,

29:04.320 --> 29:06.561
I just thought I
would do a little more...

29:06.680 --> 29:08.921
So I can help out.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.167
Uh, yeah, okay.

29:12.720 --> 29:13.926
It's quite a trailer, huh?

29:14.080 --> 29:15.650
Hmm. No kidding.

29:15.840 --> 29:16.960
What are you guys
doing here?

29:17.320 --> 29:19.368
We're looking for
a Matanga Zumbido.

29:19.560 --> 29:21.324
Looks something like this.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.921
Well, let's roll up
our sleeves.

29:26.720 --> 29:27.721
Well, you guys know
what you're doing,

29:27.800 --> 29:30.280
you don't need me for this. I
don't want to crowd up the place.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.445
Bye.
Bye.

29:40.400 --> 29:41.401
"Hexenbiests."

29:43.800 --> 29:47.361
Makes sense, after everything
Adalind's done to the both of you.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.529
Yeah. To all of us.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.081
Not to me.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.207
Hmm.

29:52.800 --> 29:53.801
You ate her cookie.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
I did?

29:57.040 --> 29:59.327
Yeah. That's why
you ate your carpet.

30:04.640 --> 30:05.721
Oh.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.369
Well, if you're not
a ghost yet,

30:17.400 --> 30:19.368
you will be when
I'm through with you.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.449
It'll be just like it was.

31:19.480 --> 31:20.481
No! Please!

31:21.960 --> 31:24.008
Who are you?
Please don't shoot!

31:24.640 --> 31:25.641
What are you doing here?

31:25.960 --> 31:28.281
It was Paul's idea to come back!
Don't hurt me!

31:28.480 --> 31:30.562
Get out. Get out.

32:02.640 --> 32:03.640
Stetson!

32:03.680 --> 32:06.160
I'm so glad you came.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.810
It's been a long time.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.604
I've got something
to show you.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.406
They're here.

32:14.480 --> 32:15.527
They're alive.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.125
This is
where I found them.

32:20.520 --> 32:22.284
Theo and my Patty together.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.007
I knew you killed them!

32:24.200 --> 32:26.248
You would've
done the same thing

32:26.320 --> 32:27.765
if you found them
like I did.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.008
I shouldn't have told you.
I never should've told you.

32:36.520 --> 32:37.521
it hurt so much.

32:41.320 --> 32:42.685
They did this to you too.

32:43.320 --> 32:44.481
Do you see them?

32:45.240 --> 32:46.241
Huh?

32:46.960 --> 32:48.405
Do you see them
like I do?

32:48.880 --> 32:50.520
I didn't want to
believe it when I saw it.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.282
But how could I let them
live after what they did?

32:53.840 --> 32:55.569
He was supposed
to be my friend.

32:56.400 --> 32:57.845
And she was my wife.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.244
Uh, I found it.

33:03.800 --> 33:04.926
Matanga Zumbido.

33:08.600 --> 33:09.601
Be my guest.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.369
"Brazil,
Village of Borba, 1921.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.169
"After weeks of
scouring the jungle,

33:18.240 --> 33:20.811
"I finally encountered the
creature deep in the Amazon.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.486
"I've been traveling with the
Batisse, an indigenous tribe.

33:23.560 --> 33:26.131
"Rumors haven't done justice
to this horrifying creature,

33:26.200 --> 33:28.885
"which the tribe members
refer to as Matanga Zumbido.

33:29.160 --> 33:32.403
"The power of this Wesen rivals
the wrath of Zeus himself.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.764
"Unfortunately,
my fellow Grimm

33:34.840 --> 33:37.081
"and compatriot, Jonas,
faced that wrath head-on.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.929
"One touch from
this Woged beast

33:39.000 --> 33:40.684
"burned that
mighty warrior to death,

33:40.760 --> 33:43.047
"scorching his skin
and shattering his skull."

33:43.120 --> 33:44.167
Sounds like our guy.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.760
Does it say how
to deal with it?

33:45.880 --> 33:47.291
Uh, let me see.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.968
"Dysentery took the lives of...
Six days without food...

33:51.520 --> 33:53.170
"Torrential downpours,
flooding..."

33:54.080 --> 33:55.080
Ah, here we go.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.248
"I survived my encounter
with Matanga Zumbido

33:57.320 --> 33:59.721
"thanks only to
an ancient tribal ritual

33:59.800 --> 34:02.770
"they use to hunt and
eat the deadly Temblon,

34:02.880 --> 34:04.723
"their term for
electric eels,

34:04.800 --> 34:06.882
"by using a paste
made from the skin

34:06.960 --> 34:10.726
"of a poison dart frog,
Anura Dendrobatidae."

34:11.360 --> 34:12.360
Think you got
any of that?

34:13.560 --> 34:14.800
I have no idea.

34:16.159 --> 34:17.525
But I'm gonna find out.

34:19.159 --> 34:21.891
So, if Stetson is
the Matanga Zumbido,

34:22.159 --> 34:24.800
Raymond thought he was filming a
ghost, not realizing he was Wesen.

34:25.199 --> 34:26.565
And Stetson toasted him.

34:26.639 --> 34:27.766
To ask the obvious,

34:27.840 --> 34:30.446
if Stetson killed his wife in
that house, why keep going back?

34:30.719 --> 34:32.245
Especially if he
found her cheating on him?

34:32.320 --> 34:33.880
That doesn't mean he
stopped loving her.

34:35.159 --> 34:36.889
Albeit a little
on the sick side.

34:41.239 --> 34:42.241
Found it.

34:43.440 --> 34:44.440
Now what?

34:44.600 --> 34:46.728
Well, this is
kind of interesting.

34:47.040 --> 34:50.931
Apparently, you mix the poison
frog skin powder with water,

34:51.480 --> 34:52.925
stir it into a paste,

34:53.000 --> 34:54.650
then you have
to pierce an ear,

34:55.280 --> 34:57.408
and rub the paste into the pierced...
Whoa...

34:58.120 --> 34:59.610
Go back to the
pierce an ear part.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.327
Okay, you have
to pierce an ear

35:03.400 --> 35:05.607
and rub the paste
into the piercing.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.000
Explains the needle.

35:11.080 --> 35:12.684
I'm not piercing my ear.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.280
Works for Hank.

35:19.960 --> 35:21.644
Yeah?
Detective Burkhardt?

35:21.840 --> 35:23.490
It's Carol.
The ghost seeker?

35:25.040 --> 35:26.040
What's wrong?

35:26.080 --> 35:27.969
I'm at the
Donovan house, Paul's inside,

35:28.040 --> 35:29.929
there's a woman with a gun!

35:30.360 --> 35:32.328
Paul wouldn't leave until he
found out what killed Raymond,

35:32.440 --> 35:33.441
I tried to talk
him out of it.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.840
But then, there was this woman
and she pointed a gun at me!

35:35.880 --> 35:38.929
Carol, stay where you are. Do not
go in the house, we're on our way.

35:39.160 --> 35:40.491
Please hurry.

35:42.760 --> 35:44.569
The woman with the gun
has to be Lily Hinkley.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.210
She must've gone
there to kill Stetson.

35:46.400 --> 35:47.606
If Stetson's there...

35:47.920 --> 35:49.410
Guess I'm piercing my ear.

35:49.640 --> 35:50.766
We'll mix it in the car.

35:53.640 --> 35:54.641
I've got it.

35:55.520 --> 35:56.521
This is it.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.762
It was the last
thing Patty wore.

36:02.200 --> 36:03.690
I want you to put it on.

36:03.760 --> 36:04.807
Why?

36:04.880 --> 36:06.291
Put it on!

36:06.360 --> 36:07.771
Okay. Okay.

36:10.240 --> 36:11.480
Oh, my God!

36:18.760 --> 36:20.120
You have to help Paul,
he's inside.

36:20.160 --> 36:21.446
Wu, stay with Carol.

36:21.520 --> 36:22.760
- Got it!
- Hey, look.

36:26.440 --> 36:27.840
We better do this
before we head in.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.441
Get it over with.

36:29.720 --> 36:30.767
What are you doing?

36:32.120 --> 36:33.485
Uh, piercing his ear.
What?

36:35.080 --> 36:36.730
That hurt.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.803
Wait. I gotta put
the paste in.

36:45.720 --> 36:47.324
What kind of police
are you?

36:49.440 --> 36:50.851
It'll be like it was.

36:56.040 --> 36:57.405
Just like it was.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.011
We were so happy.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.008
I wish we could go on
our honeymoon again.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.328
Do you remember
our honeymoon?

37:16.160 --> 37:19.004
I forgive you for what
you did to me, Patty.

37:19.440 --> 37:20.851
I know you didn't mean to.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.291
You are the love of my life.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.044
We'll go right back
to where we were.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.090
It'll be just like it was.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.526
Oh, God!

38:39.360 --> 38:41.249
What are you doing in my house?
I don't know.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.120
I know what you want.

38:43.400 --> 38:44.561
You want my wife.

38:44.640 --> 38:45.801
Stetson! No!

38:47.440 --> 38:48.441
Stop!

38:49.080 --> 38:50.570
- Let's go.
- My camera!

38:51.240 --> 38:53.846
It was a real ghost!
I saw it, you saw it, too!

38:54.000 --> 38:55.968
You and Raymond saw it!
I know you did!

39:08.400 --> 39:10.801
You're a...
Why aren't you dead?

39:11.600 --> 39:12.601
Frog paste.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.361
You're under arrest
for the murder of...

39:25.200 --> 39:26.201
Oh, my God.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.241
Come on.

39:32.440 --> 39:33.680
Are you okay?

39:37.000 --> 39:38.001
Oh.

39:38.720 --> 39:40.484
I am now.

39:45.240 --> 39:46.480
Okay, thanks.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.888
Warrant just came through, we're
clear to disinter the body

39:48.960 --> 39:50.644
in Stetson Donovan's grave.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.006
Gotta be Theo Hinkley.

39:52.360 --> 39:54.203
What are we charging
Lily Hinkley with?

39:54.720 --> 39:55.721
Nothing.

39:57.440 --> 39:58.521
She shot him.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.045
In self-defense.

40:00.840 --> 40:01.841
Sort of.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.485
She did us a favor.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.881
You can't hold a Matanga
Zumbido behind bars.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.240
Got something you
might wanna see.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.123
This just got posted
two hours ago.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.121
What are you
doing in my house?

40:21.200 --> 40:22.326
I don't know.

40:23.320 --> 40:24.321
No!

40:26.360 --> 40:27.805
We have anything
to worry about?

40:27.880 --> 40:29.211
Don't think so.

40:29.520 --> 40:30.521
Stop!

40:32.280 --> 40:33.850
No one believes in ghosts.

40:45.320 --> 40:46.924
Henrietta?

40:47.000 --> 40:48.525
Hello, Juliette.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.165
Shut the door, won't you?

40:54.320 --> 40:58.609
I believe we have
a great deal to talk about.

41:56.280 --> 41:57.725
What the hell is going on?
