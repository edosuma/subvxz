01:38.965 --> 01:41.453
We now return to Hunch.

01:42.643 --> 01:44.289
There's your murderer.

01:45.634 --> 01:46.863
Are you sure, Hunch?

01:46.937 --> 01:48.051
How do you know?

01:48.339 --> 01:49.457
Something about his hair...

01:49.507 --> 01:50.109
I don't know.

01:50.158 --> 01:51.412
How did we miss that?

01:51.462 --> 01:52.014
Get him!

01:56.346 --> 01:58.106
You did it again, Hunch.

01:58.217 --> 01:59.460
Let's go grab a bite.

01:59.502 --> 02:01.118
You know what I'm in the mood for?

02:01.248 --> 02:03.314
Could it be... turkey?

02:03.518 --> 02:04.798
But how did you...?

02:07.147 --> 02:10.761
It's amazing they've gotten 
512 shows out of this premise.

02:10.806 --> 02:13.321
Remember when we saw Hunch's 
butt in the shower?

02:13.415 --> 02:15.403
That was two seasons ago.

02:15.628 --> 02:18.523
Now you can only see butts on cable.

02:18.816 --> 02:21.903
This is Kent Brockman, with an 
isotope baseball update.

02:22.046 --> 02:26.413
The 'topes are in first place since the 
acquisition of home-run king Buck Mitchell.

02:32.176 --> 02:37.222
Thanks to him, Springfield is once 
again overrun with fair-weather fans.

02:37.537 --> 02:38.903
The isotopes are winning?

02:39.008 --> 02:40.183
To the bandwagon!

02:43.407 --> 02:47.180
Nothing beats a day at the 
ballpark with my family.

02:47.296 --> 02:49.612
Tickets, tickets, who needs tickets?

02:49.625 --> 02:52.140
Homer, we need those tickets to get in.

02:52.288 --> 02:56.871
Don't worry, I'll use the money 
I make to buy tickets from a scalper.

02:56.975 --> 03:00.371
Then I'll sell those tickets, 
and we'll be rich. Rich!

03:00.488 --> 03:01.760
We did it, baby.

03:01.786 --> 03:03.830
We made it through the rain.

03:04.157 --> 03:05.540
Tickets, $30.

03:05.565 --> 03:06.183
Big game.

03:06.197 --> 03:07.581
Everybody wants to see the game.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.711
Cop!

03:08.806 --> 03:10.611
Act like you're in love with me.

03:15.297 --> 03:17.631
Peanuts. $5 peanuts.

03:17.935 --> 03:19.143
You want to know something, Bart?

03:19.176 --> 03:20.601
Nah, I know enough.

03:20.676 --> 03:25.420
I, myself, played in this ballpark, 
back in nineteen forty-deuce.

03:25.466 --> 03:28.060
That was during the war, 
when sushi was called

03:28.078 --> 03:30.712
"liberty logs," and no one 
had ever heard of it.

03:30.838 --> 03:35.210
But grandpa, in 1942, they only 
played women's baseball here.

03:35.455 --> 03:40.122
Let's just say one of the ladies 
had some extra equipment.

03:41.777 --> 03:44.901
I was a center fielder for 
the Springfield floozies.

03:45.637 --> 03:49.970
The pay wasn't much, but it kept 
me out of the war for a year.

03:50.036 --> 03:52.252
Effie Lou is a man!

03:52.365 --> 03:55.220
Get him! He could threaten 
my record for lady triples.

03:55.566 --> 03:58.742
That was a magical summer.

03:59.126 --> 04:00.101
How'd I get here?

04:00.275 --> 04:05.802
Now, to sing our national anthem, 
payola recording artist Tabitha Vixx!

04:05.986 --> 04:07.982
She's married to Buck Mitchell.

04:08.086 --> 04:11.121
I bet that's why she's here 
tonight honoring america.

04:13.227 --> 04:23.140
Oh, say, can you see by 
the dawn'searly light...

04:24.546 --> 04:28.180
and now here's somethingfrom my new album.

04:28.405 --> 04:31.951
I'm trouble-istic stay away, boy,

04:32.008 --> 04:34.013
'causeyou know I'm trouble-istic

04:34.077 --> 04:37.211
think you can control me, 
you ain't being realistic

04:47.546 --> 04:51.992
Hey, Buck, how's it feel knowing your 
wife's turning on a creep like me?

04:52.045 --> 04:53.232
Weird, I bet.

04:54.165 --> 04:57.511
Trouble-istic girlmakes 
your troublations grow

04:57.575 --> 05:00.961
double trouble-isticwhen 
you try to tell me no

05:02.607 --> 05:06.052
trouble, trouble,oh, yeah, trouble...

05:07.106 --> 05:15.341
...and the home of the brave.

05:18.707 --> 05:22.832
she just embarrassed me in front 
of the entire tornado belt league.

05:27.787 --> 05:31.252
So next up for the cosmos, Freddie Alvarado.

05:31.327 --> 05:35.372
Freddie, of course,the older brother 
of the famous wolf boy of Juarez, Mexico.

05:35.406 --> 05:36.591
Here's the pitch...

05:38.998 --> 05:42.210
And Buck Mitchell can't find the handle.

05:42.407 --> 05:44.653
That's an e-3 if you're keeping score at home,

05:44.738 --> 05:48.491
and if you are, your loneliness saddens me.

05:49.256 --> 05:51.390
It's okay, buck. Bad hop, bad hop.

05:53.567 --> 05:54.802
Shake it off, buck.

05:56.896 --> 05:57.820
You suck!

05:57.995 --> 05:59.422
I concur!

05:59.657 --> 06:01.380
Bart, hand me that sack of batteries.

06:02.087 --> 06:04.201
Nine volt! Double a!D! D! D! D!

06:04.255 --> 06:05.422
Cordless drill!

06:05.916 --> 06:10.490
Job himself never had a tougher day 
at the ball park than Buck Mitchell.

06:10.496 --> 06:15.310
He's made six errors, struck 
out twice and swallowed a bee.

06:16.788 --> 06:18.163
My fiancÃ©e!

06:23.068 --> 06:27.343
They're making a mockery out of 
amerisnack. Comtroll doll night.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.113
You know what to do, Duffman.

06:29.227 --> 06:32.991
Oh, yeah! Time for the duff 
triple-malt kiss-cam!

06:33.138 --> 06:33.842
Oh, yeah!

06:33.887 --> 06:35.452
Oh, yeah! Duffman!

06:36.377 --> 06:42.480
But then he kissed me and then he kissed me...

06:42.585 --> 06:43.791
look, it's a thing.

06:43.937 --> 06:48.832
Each time I saw him I couldn't 
wait to see him again...

06:52.567 --> 06:55.590
We both find public displays of affection vulgar.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.391
Come on, doc, she'sa fine-looking woman.

06:57.546 --> 06:58.692
You don't want to work that?

06:58.928 --> 07:04.332
I didn't know just what to do 
so I whispered "I love you..."

07:04.386 --> 07:06.230
Homer... Homer!

07:06.285 --> 07:07.781
Now we have to kiss.

07:07.798 --> 07:09.643
The big tv istelling us to.

07:10.715 --> 07:12.322
Look at that ugly old man.

07:12.367 --> 07:13.412
That's you.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.360
Give me a kiss, Homie.

07:20.435 --> 07:23.380
Really? You'd kiss an ugly old man like me?

07:23.427 --> 07:24.942
Only if he'll kiss me back.

07:25.165 --> 07:27.350
And then he kissed me

07:28.506 --> 07:30.903
and then he kissed me

07:31.885 --> 07:34.140
and then he kissed me.

07:34.826 --> 07:36.080
Yeah, Homer.

07:36.125 --> 07:37.321
Suck that face.

07:38.056 --> 07:40.051
Remember when we used to kiss like that, Carl?

07:40.166 --> 07:41.762
With our respective girlfriends.

07:41.937 --> 07:43.922
Yeah, I wonder where Jill and Kelly are now?

07:44.117 --> 07:45.440
I heard Jill died.

07:45.618 --> 07:47.062
Kelly, I think, is a prostitute.

07:50.508 --> 07:51.540
what a game!

07:51.545 --> 07:56.013
I got on the kiss-cam,I participated in 
"the wave" and I go to pee in a trough.

07:56.298 --> 07:57.511
Marge, can we get a trough?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.833
For the last time, no.

08:00.767 --> 08:01.561
Iced tea!

08:04.426 --> 08:06.591
Hey, that was my ice tea.

08:06.596 --> 08:08.722
I just sweetened itto my liking.

08:12.016 --> 08:12.923
Buck Mitchell!

08:13.566 --> 08:16.052
The baseball-playing man.

08:16.247 --> 08:19.003
I barely recognize you without your costume on.

08:19.097 --> 08:19.852
Evening, ma'am.

08:19.995 --> 08:23.882
I-I couldn't help seeing you two 
exchanging marital kisses tonight.

08:24.117 --> 08:27.490
Yes, yes, the game you played so horribly at.

08:27.556 --> 08:30.490
Well, unfortunately, my 
marriage ain't so good.

08:31.507 --> 08:34.712
I never heard anything about it on the gossip shows

08:34.717 --> 08:38.530
or the blogosphere or in my 
supermarket checkout magazine.

08:41.236 --> 08:44.123
I was wondering if you and the mister
could give us some marriage counseling.

08:44.126 --> 08:47.060
You know? In return, I can give you season tickets.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.240
Season tickets?

08:48.496 --> 08:50.272
I could entertain business clients.

08:50.376 --> 08:52.103
I might even land the Henderson account.

08:52.575 --> 08:55.532
Homer, can I see you in the kitchen?

08:55.717 --> 08:56.410
Sure.

08:56.735 --> 08:58.950
That means she want sto talk in private.

08:59.036 --> 09:00.870
It's probably about you.

09:02.566 --> 09:05.871
Homie, I don't think our marriage is so jim-dandy

09:05.878 --> 09:07.961
that we should be counseling others.

09:08.137 --> 09:10.050
Hey, we've gone through more hardships

09:10.055 --> 09:12.273
than the jews and Charlie Brown put together.

09:12.968 --> 09:19.172
Well, we have managed to squeeze 
a lot of fun out of married life.

09:21.327 --> 09:23.350
That's just how I feel!

09:26.016 --> 09:29.393
See, that's what I want, care free 
intimacy with no edge of resentment.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.390
Buck Mitchell!

09:31.677 --> 09:33.400
Buck, I guess we can help you out.

09:33.522 --> 09:34.778
We'll start tomorrow.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.334
Hey, buck, buck, buck!

09:36.358 --> 09:38.468
It's me, the weird guy from the stadium!

09:39.035 --> 09:41.460
There were a lot of weird 
guys at the stadium tonight.

09:41.636 --> 09:43.023
You know, I remembered you.

09:47.758 --> 09:49.821
Buck, Tabitha, welcome.

09:49.996 --> 09:53.642
We'll start your first marriage counseling 
session as soon as Homer gets here.

09:55.485 --> 09:56.093
Sorry I'm late.

09:56.147 --> 09:58.222
I was just gathering my counseling equipment.

10:11.197 --> 10:13.643
Now, let's remember... no one's right

10:13.705 --> 10:16.951
and no one's wrong... till I say so.

10:17.948 --> 10:21.241
I-I think what Homer means 
is why don't you tell us

10:21.246 --> 10:23.503
what each of you feels is the problem?

10:23.696 --> 10:25.251
Well, I'm an old-fashioned guy, you know,

10:25.258 --> 10:28.100
and when we got hitched, 
I just assumed she'd give up

10:28.107 --> 10:31.831
her international recording career to 
focus on my minor league baseball dreams.

10:32.008 --> 10:35.062
Wow, I think we really hit on something here.

10:35.258 --> 10:37.032
Unfortunately, we're out of time.

10:37.325 --> 10:38.571
How does that make you feel?

10:38.847 --> 10:40.153
Shut up. My 10:00's here.

10:42.775 --> 10:43.802
Homer, please.

10:44.587 --> 10:46.532
Let's see here...

10:47.795 --> 10:50.561
Here's something the book's 
previous owner underlined--

10:50.757 --> 10:53.813
"be honest with your partner 
about what you're feeling."

10:54.175 --> 10:56.830
I don't want to waste any more 
time in a mismatched marriage.

10:58.376 --> 11:02.573
"Try to frame criticisms of 
your spouse in a positive way."

11:02.647 --> 11:06.062
Well, I'm positively sick 
of her shaking her lady parts

11:06.067 --> 11:07.573
for the whole world to eyeball.

11:08.957 --> 11:11.502
Interesting. Interesting.

11:14.465 --> 11:18.302
Buck, you've got a beautiful woman 
with a hot body that any man

11:18.307 --> 11:22.182
would fantasize about even while 
making love to his own Marge.

11:23.285 --> 11:24.533
Thank you, Homer.

11:24.787 --> 11:26.641
Maybe we should stop here.

11:26.688 --> 11:30.503
Good idea, honey. Buck, would you mind 
signing a couple of baseballs for my boy?

11:31.228 --> 11:31.983
Yeah, sure.

11:46.346 --> 11:48.550
Just sign your name above 
president Lincoln's.

11:49.636 --> 11:52.612
Isn't it weird that our parents 
are giving marital advice?

11:52.735 --> 11:53.753
They're always fighting.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.432
If you listen closely, you can 
hear them arguing right now.

11:56.555 --> 12:00.441
And I say a monkey can mow our lawn!

12:04.778 --> 12:07.240
This house is spectacular.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.892
You must have had a great view of the riots.

12:10.218 --> 12:11.800
I stole a rack of fur coats.

12:11.866 --> 12:13.863
I sell one a year to pay for christmas.

12:16.507 --> 12:17.983
You make me laugh, Homer.

12:18.197 --> 12:19.311
Why, 'cause I'm fat?

12:19.755 --> 12:25.160
Okay, tonight we're gonna discuss 
little ways to keep your romance alive:

12:25.317 --> 12:30.732
Make time for each other, an hour, 
an evening, a mini vacation.

12:30.928 --> 12:34.111
Well, I am presenting at the espy awards next week.

12:34.458 --> 12:35.333
And I'm receiving.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.300
We can wait for our limos together.

12:37.456 --> 12:40.341
Or take the same limo.

12:45.248 --> 12:48.842
Like I always say,"compromise is the key."

12:49.165 --> 12:50.470
I always say that.

12:50.707 --> 12:53.642
Let's compromise and say nobody said it.

12:55.798 --> 12:58.660
And here's the pitch to Buck Mitchell.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.812
It's going, going...

13:01.955 --> 13:08.042
and like america's credibility on 
the world stage, that ball is gone.

13:10.027 --> 13:12.950
Buck mitchell is back and sluggier than ever.

13:13.086 --> 13:15.091
With five home runs in two 
nights, he's ended rumors

13:15.097 --> 13:18.423
of early retirement and inspired 
rumors of steroid abuse.

13:18.617 --> 13:20.762
But I've heard this turn around 
is due to the marriage

13:20.767 --> 13:24.502
counseling of Marge and Homer Simpson, 
seen in this file photo.

13:24.735 --> 13:25.832
Homer, I'm proud of you.

13:25.925 --> 13:29.293
You've prolonged a celebrity marriage 
at least through playoff season.

13:29.328 --> 13:31.431
After that, who gives a hobo's crap?

13:31.598 --> 13:32.212
Am I right?

13:40.317 --> 13:48.862
I'm a girl who loves men and we 
live in sexy marriage land

13:50.028 --> 13:52.182
sexy marriage land

13:52.226 --> 13:56.232
ooh, marriage sexy marriage land.

13:59.108 --> 14:01.852
Wow, I've got this sudden urge 
to give her a five-dollar bill.

14:01.976 --> 14:03.733
That's it.We're out of here.

14:10.197 --> 14:11.980
Hey, Tabitha, great show.

14:12.175 --> 14:14.151
I like that part where you 
mentioned Springfield.

14:14.265 --> 14:15.702
Did you know that's where you are?

14:17.686 --> 14:19.122
Why don't you stay and have a bite?

14:20.117 --> 14:21.610
You're so hot.

14:21.766 --> 14:24.392
If only I'd seen you before I met my wife.

14:24.665 --> 14:27.010
Homer, you're sweet, but...

14:28.837 --> 14:29.881
You're talking to the chicken.

14:30.775 --> 14:33.203
Don't tell the hamburger in my car.

14:33.397 --> 14:36.533
Listen, these shows always tense me up.

14:36.687 --> 14:39.951
While your finger sare greasy, 
could you give me a neck rub?

14:40.425 --> 14:41.233
Okay.

14:42.556 --> 14:45.081
So why didn't you marry one 
of your crummy backup dancers?

14:45.276 --> 14:47.111
They're day laborers.

14:47.185 --> 14:49.353
We picked them up inthe home depot parking lot.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.331
Oh, yeah.

14:51.626 --> 14:53.260
Oh, that's it. Right there.

14:53.425 --> 14:56.902
Oh, yes.

14:56.926 --> 14:58.830
Yes, it feels so good.

14:58.895 --> 15:00.920
Oh, yeah.

15:01.698 --> 15:04.830
Oh, yeah, baby.

15:05.037 --> 15:06.830
Thank god I brought protection.

15:07.165 --> 15:09.583
I used to be so embarrassed buying these.

15:10.047 --> 15:10.812
Homer simpson?

15:11.097 --> 15:12.582
You're supposed to be my marriage counselor.

15:12.676 --> 15:14.170
I did work book pages for you.

15:17.505 --> 15:20.251
We're going to have a lot 
to talk about at your 3:00.

15:20.345 --> 15:21.572
There ain't gonna be a 3:00.

15:22.436 --> 15:27.610
cancellations require 24 hours... notice.

15:30.996 --> 15:35.971
And that's why Lou Gehrig was a selfish 
cry baby who deserved to die.

15:36.707 --> 15:38.193
Springfield, let's hear from you.

15:38.546 --> 15:39.751
Yeah, I got a question.

15:40.218 --> 15:42.600
How come Buck Mitchell's game
is in the toilet again?

15:42.936 --> 15:45.040
Well, rumor has it his marriage is failing

15:45.167 --> 15:48.481
due to the inept counseling 
of Homer and Marge simpson.

15:49.047 --> 15:50.100
I knew it, I knew it!

15:50.468 --> 15:53.232
So, do I win a jock squawk t-shirt?

15:53.436 --> 15:54.592
No. Sorry.

15:54.846 --> 15:57.042
It don't need no writing on it. 
It don't even have to be clean.

15:57.326 --> 15:58.151
Is this Moe?

15:58.388 --> 16:00.191
What happened to that bumper 
sticker we gave you?

16:00.485 --> 16:02.052
WIt's holding in my hernia.

16:04.877 --> 16:08.053
Dad, because you and mom screwed 
up Buck Mitchell's marriage,

16:08.238 --> 16:09.793
some kids beat me up at school today.

16:09.947 --> 16:11.602
Yeah, they beat me up at work.

16:11.747 --> 16:14.420
Look at the word they wrote on my skull.

16:15.896 --> 16:16.303
Papa.

16:16.628 --> 16:19.463
I didn't want you to learn 
that word this way.

16:19.908 --> 16:22.210
Marge, we got to get Buck 
and Tabitha back together.

16:22.457 --> 16:24.631
This is the most important 
case of our careers.

16:24.958 --> 16:28.761
Listen, Bub, we are out of the
 marriage counseling business.

16:28.866 --> 16:32.372
And the only one you should be giving 
chicken grease neck rubs to is me.

16:32.647 --> 16:35.042
But not me, 'cause I thinkthey're disgusting.

16:35.208 --> 16:39.222
So now we're judging each 
other based on things we've done.

16:39.457 --> 16:40.293
Real fair.

16:40.506 --> 16:41.352
Class act.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.943
I'm going back to the stadium to 
bring those two kids back together.

16:45.118 --> 16:46.653
And I'll do it with or without you.

16:46.897 --> 16:48.881
Then I guess you'll do it without me.

16:50.758 --> 16:52.442
But i wanted to do it with you.

16:52.536 --> 16:54.420
Crossed arms mean "no."

17:18.605 --> 17:20.771
Tabitha, what a coincidence.

17:20.994 --> 17:23.849
I was just thinking sad thoughts about you.

17:24.056 --> 17:26.242
I came to tell you I'm leaving buck.

17:27.167 --> 17:27.540
What?!

17:27.758 --> 17:29.743
No. No...

17:30.215 --> 17:30.673
what?

17:31.965 --> 17:32.851
No!

17:33.928 --> 17:34.340
W hat?

17:34.718 --> 17:36.761
Buck and I don't belong together.

17:36.975 --> 17:38.350
Don't give up on Buck.

17:38.648 --> 17:42.601
There must be something about him 
that attracted you in the first place.

17:43.185 --> 17:44.623
Well, yeah.

17:44.925 --> 17:48.113
He was the first man who didn't 
just like me for my body.

17:48.386 --> 17:50.732
He always complimented meon my hair.

17:51.936 --> 17:54.300
Your standing lamp is dirty. I'll polish it.

17:59.098 --> 18:00.320
Cancel all my appointments.

18:01.066 --> 18:01.792
Let's go.

18:04.766 --> 18:09.890
So here comes Buck Mitchell in 
a spot every kid dreams of,

18:09.905 --> 18:15.690
where a sacrifice fly could lead his minor 
league team to a wild card spot.

18:19.616 --> 18:21.320
And there's the duff blimp...

18:21.968 --> 18:25.982
with a special message from Tabitha to Buck.

18:26.517 --> 18:29.143
Said zeppelin has a whole lotta love.

18:32.217 --> 18:34.331
It's working. Buck's buying my fake message.

18:34.675 --> 18:36.913
And you said it would never work.

18:37.226 --> 18:39.313
No, I said, "duffmanwill do what you want.

18:39.508 --> 18:41.620
Stop kicking and punching duffman."

18:46.116 --> 18:47.360
I'm whacking this for you, baby.

18:49.718 --> 18:53.972
And he sends one into the slug-o-sphere.

18:54.038 --> 18:56.623
It's going... going...

19:04.475 --> 19:06.313
My sister's friend!

19:12.845 --> 19:14.232
Tabitha! Tabitha!

19:14.735 --> 19:17.101
This is the worst blimp crash ever!

19:17.337 --> 19:18.393
Too soon!

19:18.727 --> 19:19.611
Where are you, sweetie?

19:20.815 --> 19:22.153
She was here a minute ago.

19:22.368 --> 19:23.790
She must be pooping.

19:24.747 --> 19:25.431
Hey, you're lying.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.041
This whole stunt was a lie.

19:27.147 --> 19:28.841
Get him! He ruined mini-bat day.

19:30.997 --> 19:32.360
Leave him alone.

19:32.626 --> 19:35.991
All he did was try to help a 
young couple find their way.

19:36.245 --> 19:39.050
Does he really deserve to 
get strung up for that?

19:42.865 --> 19:43.772
Cut that out.

19:44.058 --> 19:46.270
Duffman gives the people what they want.

19:46.665 --> 19:48.153
Weren't you just tied up in the blimp?

19:48.447 --> 19:50.882
Three duffmen are working the game tonight.

19:51.208 --> 19:54.291
Don't tell the children. It's disillusioning.

19:55.096 --> 19:58.090
Duffman, duffman, duffman, duffman, duffman.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.601
Marriage is hard work.

20:00.937 --> 20:04.900
But it's worth it when you've 
got someone wonderful like I do.

20:07.948 --> 20:10.202
Buck, I love you, too.

20:10.275 --> 20:13.472
And I'll take you back, if you 
can guess tonight's attendance.

20:19.015 --> 20:20.842
Let's see, B.

20:20.846 --> 20:23.270
No, no, no. A. No, no, oh, man, man!

20:23.416 --> 20:24.382
It's C.

20:24.628 --> 20:26.650
As in "keeping together."

20:27.176 --> 20:29.211
Which is what I want to do.

20:29.778 --> 20:32.520
Well, Homer, looks like my marriage 
is going into extra innings.

20:32.868 --> 20:33.670
Great.

20:33.906 --> 20:35.510
But enough of the baseball analogies.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.283
They sicken me. No problem.

20:37.677 --> 20:40.293
No, milady,your carriage awaits.

20:48.368 --> 20:49.953
Ain't love grand, tito?

20:50.368 --> 20:51.263
Hey, man,I don't care!

20:51.638 --> 20:53.200
Bandits just kidnapped my mother.

20:53.678 --> 20:54.330
Just found out.

20:55.078 --> 20:59.332
