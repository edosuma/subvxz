03:51.270 --> 03:54.060
Samidha, I need you to help me
prepare the prasad tonight.

03:55.270 --> 03:56.690
Sure.

04:04.780 --> 04:06.040
Promise.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.790
You can't throw out "kasams"
after everything you say.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.750
The point is hand-made prasad.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.100
You know, my sisters and I

04:24.300 --> 04:27.020
used to get new outfits
every day of the puja.

04:27.220 --> 04:29.430
I used to cook with your Nani.

04:29.850 --> 04:32.350
Your Nani cooked with my Nani.

04:32.980 --> 04:34.190
And--

04:37.900 --> 04:40.990
The prasad needs to be ready
when the guests come.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.610
I'm not asking again.

04:47.780 --> 04:49.200
Here you go.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.180
She failed it again.

05:20.730 --> 05:23.190
This was the third time.

05:26.070 --> 05:28.410
Samidha, don't whistle.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.620
Evil spirits will hear you.

05:37.460 --> 05:39.540
When will this girl learn?

05:42.050 --> 05:43.840
Samidha! Your lunch!

25:31.400 --> 25:33.490
Today, our friend...

25:33.690 --> 25:38.570
Radha is praying for the safe
return of her daughter, Tamira.

25:39.120 --> 25:42.410
Let's all pray for
Tamira together.

25:52.300 --> 25:57.050
Please God, don't let them
end up like the Choudharys.

26:14.900 --> 26:15.990
What is it?

27:24.260 --> 27:26.060
What's going on, meri jaan?

27:40.240 --> 27:41.030
What are you doing here?

27:41.360 --> 27:43.320
You have to be out there,
with the guests.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.240
Samidha, you can't just leave.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.160
This is our puja.

27:50.620 --> 27:52.210
She's trying to leave
in the middle of our puja.

27:57.550 --> 27:58.510
Let her go.

27:59.260 --> 27:59.970
What?

28:06.720 --> 28:08.180
Let's give her space.

28:10.100 --> 28:11.060
Come on.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.020
What happened to Tamira?

40:44.020 --> 40:46.060
What did you do, Samidha?

40:57.370 --> 40:59.700
Do you even know why
we celebrate Durga Puja?

41:01.080 --> 41:04.250
We all prayed for
Tamira together.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.540
And that prasad that you hated
making so much...

41:08.340 --> 41:10.630
...that was our offering.

41:11.050 --> 41:12.340
For her safety.

41:12.550 --> 41:14.050
For her well-being.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.680
Why don't you bring your friends
home anymore?

41:23.100 --> 41:25.150
And you don't speak
our language anymore.

41:25.940 --> 41:27.110
Do you even remember it?

41:28.610 --> 41:30.110
So then, why?

41:30.780 --> 41:32.610
Why do you want to be
one of them?

48:38.790 --> 48:40.790
I don't even know
who she is anymore.

48:40.990 --> 48:43.960
This is our Samidha.
She's a good kid.

48:44.160 --> 48:45.510
What are you even saying?

48:45.710 --> 48:48.340
She won't even tell us
what happened.

50:56.090 --> 50:57.430
Oh, God...

50:58.890 --> 51:00.810
I don't know what we're
even doing here anymore.

51:01.010 --> 51:01.970
What? We're talking--

51:03.060 --> 51:03.970
I mean, here.

51:04.390 --> 51:06.430
We're at home.

51:06.770 --> 51:07.730
Home?

51:09.230 --> 51:11.360
Did you see how
they looked at us?

51:17.400 --> 51:20.030
Where are you going?
Come here.

51:51.100 --> 51:52.270
She won't tell us anything.

51:59.110 --> 52:02.030
You're right.
We don't.

52:12.580 --> 52:13.750
Don't bother, Inesh.

52:14.960 --> 52:16.210
She won't tell us anything.

52:17.340 --> 52:20.800
And why would she?
We're nothing to her.

53:53.560 --> 53:54.850
Shame.

53:58.860 --> 54:00.150
Shame.

54:16.330 --> 54:17.630
Shame.

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:40.420
Then, tell me.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.050
Samidha, I'm trying.

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:04.500
What's the word?

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:38.390
She's been gone
since Thursday, right?

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:09.500
"If you face a Pishach alone,
you won't come out alive."

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:50.250
We don't have meat, but
we'll offer what we can.

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:44.520
Nothing.

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:46.810
I was thinking...

01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:49.520
...maybe this was my fault.

01:14:50.610 --> 01:14:52.030
All of this.

01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:03.620
You know...

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.080
...we tried our best.

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.670
We did as much as we could.

01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:12.000
We sent money.

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.880
Whenever they
needed anything, we--

01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:34.940
So strange seeing
you this way...

01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:39.110
...without your phone.

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.110
Stay behind me.

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.860
What are you doing home
so early?

01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:06.370
What's going on?

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:04.280
Where a death has happened.

01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:11.830
Samidha, not alone!
