WEBVTT

00:38.210 --> 00:40.419
[train clanking]

00:50.843 --> 00:53.570
[train rumbling on tracks]

01:05.341 --> 01:07.929
[lock clicks]

01:07.964 --> 01:10.518
[bell jingles]

01:12.693 --> 01:14.315
To the naked eye,

01:14.350 --> 01:16.973
a suit appears to consist
of two parts:

01:17.007 --> 01:19.631
a jacket and trousers.

01:23.324 --> 01:26.569
But those two
seemingly solid parts

01:26.603 --> 01:29.503
are composed of
four different fabrics.

01:31.815 --> 01:35.716
Cotton, silk, mohair and wool.

01:37.511 --> 01:42.343
And those four fabrics are
cut into 38 separate pieces.

01:43.689 --> 01:48.004
The process of sizing, forming,
conjoining those pieces

01:48.038 --> 01:52.802
requires no fewer than
228 steps.

02:00.844 --> 02:03.088
[teakettle whistling]

02:27.423 --> 02:30.564
So the first step
is measurement.

02:49.272 --> 02:54.415
But "measurement" doesn'’t mean,
uh, just reaching for your tape,

02:54.450 --> 02:57.073
"So many inches here,
so many inches there."

02:57.107 --> 02:58.868
No, no, no.

03:26.413 --> 03:29.105
You cannot make something good

03:30.900 --> 03:34.800
until you understand
who you'’re making it for.

03:37.147 --> 03:39.149
[bell jingles]

03:42.670 --> 03:45.052
All clothing says something.

03:45.086 --> 03:47.641
I'’ve had gentlemen
walk into my shop and boast,

03:47.675 --> 03:50.264
"Oh, I don'’t care about
what I wear."

03:50.299 --> 03:54.958
And assuming that'’s true,
doesn'’t that say something, too?

04:10.457 --> 04:12.252
So, who is your customer?

04:12.286 --> 04:14.184
And what are you trying to say
about him?

04:18.361 --> 04:23.297
A man walks through your door,
what about him can you observe?

04:23.332 --> 04:24.954
-[bell jingles]
-Good morning.

04:24.988 --> 04:26.438
Is he timid,

04:26.473 --> 04:29.648
hunched over
like a midday clock?

04:29.683 --> 04:32.962
Or does he stand
with confidence,

04:32.996 --> 04:35.482
spine at six and twelve?

04:36.828 --> 04:40.625
Is this a man
of springtime pastel,

04:40.659 --> 04:43.317
clamoring to be noticed?

04:43.352 --> 04:47.770
Or is this a man
of gray and brown,

04:47.804 --> 04:52.015
blending into the hurried crowd?

04:52.050 --> 04:55.536
Is this a man comfortable
in his station?

04:56.986 --> 04:58.436
[bell jingles]

04:58.470 --> 05:01.162
Or does he pine
for grander things?

05:04.234 --> 05:07.203
And who would this man
like to be?

05:12.657 --> 05:14.383
And who is he underneath?

05:20.492 --> 05:22.701
[jingles]

05:52.904 --> 05:54.423
Take your measure...

05:57.633 --> 06:01.257
...and when you understand
who he is...

06:01.291 --> 06:03.466
[jingles]

06:06.469 --> 06:08.022
Mr. Boyle.

06:08.057 --> 06:10.300
...then you'’re ready to begin.

06:11.336 --> 06:13.096
Knock, knock.

06:13.131 --> 06:15.236
-Hmm.
-How'’s business, English?

06:15.271 --> 06:16.928
Evening, sirs.

06:24.487 --> 06:27.214
-Oh, wow. It'’s a nice one.
-Mm-hmm.

06:27.248 --> 06:28.698
Yeah, that'’s really nice.

06:28.733 --> 06:30.044
You making that for my pops?

06:30.079 --> 06:31.874
Not this one.

06:31.908 --> 06:34.255
You'’re making those fine threads
for somebody else? Who?

06:34.290 --> 06:38.052
Master Richie, you know
I can'’t talk about my gentlemen.

06:38.087 --> 06:40.917
Huh. Is that what we are?
Your gentlemen.

06:42.816 --> 06:44.783
Whoa, get a load of English.

06:44.818 --> 06:46.371
Keeping his lips shut tight.

06:51.272 --> 06:53.274
-Your father was here.
-Oh, yeah?

06:53.309 --> 06:55.725
Uh... yesterday.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.762
He said your business

06:57.796 --> 06:59.660
is undergoing
some manner of expansion.

06:59.695 --> 07:03.457
He said I should plan on making
you a new suit to celebrate.

07:03.492 --> 07:05.770
Francis, what do you think?
New threads? Long as we'’re here?

07:05.804 --> 07:07.323
-Not tonight.
-Hey, come on. We got time.

07:07.357 --> 07:09.670
Not tonight.

07:09.705 --> 07:11.810
Oh, shit.

07:11.845 --> 07:13.709
Is that from the Outfit?

07:19.818 --> 07:21.958
English, do me a favor.

07:21.993 --> 07:23.995
Why don'’t you, uh, go up front,

07:24.029 --> 07:27.101
check on your secretary
for me, all right?

07:27.136 --> 07:29.794
Will you excuse me, gentlemen.

07:30.898 --> 07:32.313
It'’s the Outfit, man.

07:32.348 --> 07:34.626
It'’s his brass ring right here.

07:34.661 --> 07:37.664
Right, go ahead, open it up.
See what it says.

07:54.543 --> 07:55.716
Any mail?

07:55.751 --> 07:57.477
Do you want to talk about it?

07:58.443 --> 07:59.513
The mail?

07:59.548 --> 08:00.997
That they gave you the boot.

08:02.551 --> 08:04.000
What'’s in the box?

08:05.036 --> 08:06.244
That one'’s mine.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.625
Let'’s have a look.

08:07.659 --> 08:09.385
[laughs softly]
Okay.

08:09.419 --> 08:11.387
No, no, let me guess.

08:11.421 --> 08:14.252
Uh, the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.702
Mm-mm.

08:15.736 --> 08:17.082
I'’ve never understood
the appeal.

08:17.117 --> 08:19.257
All it does is lean.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.259
The Eiffel Tower?

08:21.293 --> 08:22.812
I already have that.

08:22.847 --> 08:25.470
Well, then I give up.

08:29.474 --> 08:30.510
What is that?

08:31.580 --> 08:33.374
I'’ll show you.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.692
Ah-ha.

08:40.727 --> 08:42.073
I feel at home again.

08:42.107 --> 08:43.246
Isn'’t it beautiful?

08:43.281 --> 08:45.007
It'’s a clock.

08:45.041 --> 08:47.285
Unlike some of us,
I'’ve never seen it in person.

08:47.319 --> 08:48.700
In person, it'’s still a clock.

08:48.735 --> 08:50.599
On the banks of the Thames.

08:50.633 --> 08:52.117
-You'’ve seen clocks in Chicago?
-Yes, of course, but...

08:52.152 --> 08:55.051
They look startlingly similar
in London.

08:55.086 --> 08:57.847
[laughs]:
Okay.

08:57.882 --> 09:00.678
I will never understand you.

09:00.712 --> 09:05.165
Well, you will never be
a-a dashing gentleman

09:06.269 --> 09:08.133
of a certain age.

09:08.168 --> 09:10.998
You'’ve been all over the world.

09:13.069 --> 09:15.244
You could have a shop
anywhere you like.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.557
And yet you'’re here.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.317
What'’s wrong with here?

09:22.423 --> 09:25.047
I can think of a few things.

09:25.081 --> 09:27.325
Some things
one finds everywhere, dear.

09:27.359 --> 09:30.604
So it doesn'’t terribly much
matter where I am.

09:30.639 --> 09:31.778
I have me shears.

09:32.951 --> 09:35.091
What else does a man need
besides his shears?

09:35.920 --> 09:37.128
And I have you.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.616
Not forever.

09:43.479 --> 09:46.102
Ah, yes.

09:46.137 --> 09:47.379
Ben awaits.

09:52.281 --> 09:54.766
One way or another...

09:56.285 --> 09:58.459
...I'’m getting out of here.

09:58.494 --> 09:59.702
To London?

10:00.669 --> 10:02.602
To London.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.776
And Madrid. [laughs]

10:04.811 --> 10:06.122
-And Barcelona.
-Mm.

10:06.157 --> 10:08.297
-And Morocco.
-[chuckles]

10:08.331 --> 10:09.505
And to Paris.

10:09.539 --> 10:13.474
[both laugh]

10:13.509 --> 10:15.545
You know what'’d make it
happen a lot sooner?

10:15.580 --> 10:17.962
-A map?
-A raise. Please.

10:17.996 --> 10:20.033
I best go see
if Master Richie needs me.

10:20.067 --> 10:21.621
-[door sliding open]
-Ah.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.519
Speak of the devils.

10:23.553 --> 10:24.658
What'’s that now?

10:24.693 --> 10:26.349
Just an expression, sirs.

10:26.384 --> 10:28.041
-[jingling]
-Excuse me.

10:28.075 --> 10:30.250
I meant no offense.

10:33.253 --> 10:34.668
See you tomorrow.

10:37.878 --> 10:40.467
-[bell jingles]
-[door closes]

10:40.501 --> 10:42.814
-[dog barking in distance]
-[church bells chiming]

11:39.146 --> 11:41.424
The horologist'’s apprentice
popped in yesterday.

11:41.459 --> 11:42.632
He'’s awfully nice.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.600
S... What'’d he... uh, who-who?

11:44.634 --> 11:46.188
From down the street.

11:46.222 --> 11:47.948
He'’s ever so handsome.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.022
Are you... trying to get me
to go on a date

11:53.057 --> 11:55.266
with the guy who works
at the watch shop?

11:55.300 --> 11:58.545
He'’s an apprentice
to the horologist.

11:58.579 --> 12:00.478
The one with
the little mustache?

12:00.512 --> 12:02.204
Yes, like Errol Flynn.

12:02.238 --> 12:05.069
I do not need you telling me
who to date.

12:05.103 --> 12:07.036
I didn'’t mean it like that.

12:07.071 --> 12:10.212
You meant it like, "I saw you
smiling at Richie Boyle earlier

12:10.246 --> 12:11.765
"and now I'’m petrified

12:11.800 --> 12:13.594
that you'’re running
with a bad batch."

12:13.629 --> 12:17.460
Those men may be customers,
but they are not gentlemen.

12:17.495 --> 12:20.498
Could'’ve fooled me in those
nice clothes you make for '’em.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.983
If we only allowed angels
to be customers,

12:23.018 --> 12:25.123
soon we'’d have
no customers at all.

12:25.158 --> 12:27.954
Do we let all of our customers
keep lockboxes in back?

12:27.988 --> 12:30.335
It was you
who was smiling at him.

12:30.370 --> 12:31.785
I'’ve spent my entire life

12:31.820 --> 12:33.683
around animals
like Richie Boyle.

12:33.718 --> 12:36.065
You want to get him to back off,
you look him dead in the eyes

12:36.100 --> 12:37.584
and you pretend
you'’re one of 'em.

12:37.618 --> 12:39.344
You don'’t need me worrying
after you.

12:39.379 --> 12:41.484
-That'’s right.
-You can take care of yourself.

12:41.519 --> 12:42.831
You'’re not my...

12:44.694 --> 12:46.006
-You know.
-I do.

12:46.041 --> 12:47.939
My father was a shit,
so y-y-y...

12:47.974 --> 12:49.354
Take that as a compliment.

12:50.183 --> 12:51.632
I will.

13:06.199 --> 13:07.338
I know...

13:08.511 --> 13:10.341
that you hope that
I'’ll start loving this

13:10.375 --> 13:12.515
-the way that you do.
-No. I don'’t.

13:12.550 --> 13:14.241
-I don'’t.
-That I'’ll train...

13:15.725 --> 13:18.314
learn the craft.

13:18.349 --> 13:20.869
One day maybe even
take over the shop.

13:23.872 --> 13:26.081
But I don'’t want that.
I don'’t want your life.

13:28.911 --> 13:30.464
You'’re entitled to your own.

13:30.499 --> 13:32.363
-I am.
-You'’re a smart young woman

13:32.397 --> 13:33.536
who'’s going to take herself

13:33.571 --> 13:35.331
-far away from here.
-I will.

13:35.366 --> 13:38.783
And when I go, I just don'’t
want you to be all alone.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.200
[chuckles softly]

13:42.235 --> 13:45.514
I don'’t need you
looking after me either.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.691
After all,
you'’re not my, you know.

13:57.457 --> 13:59.390
-Fair enough.
-[chuckles softly]

13:59.424 --> 14:01.702
Now, if you want that raise,

14:01.737 --> 14:07.053
first you have to learn
what a bloody square looks like.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.851
[bell jingles]

14:31.940 --> 14:34.390
[steam hissing]

15:36.107 --> 15:38.316

15:42.217 --> 15:44.460
[flames crackling]

15:44.495 --> 15:46.117

15:46.152 --> 15:49.362
[crackling grows louder]

15:54.850 --> 15:57.025
-[crackling stops]
-[door opens, bell jingles]

15:57.059 --> 15:59.165
MABLE [singsongy]:
We gotta find the keys.

15:59.199 --> 16:00.442
-[Richie speaks indistinctly]
-[door closes]

16:00.476 --> 16:02.892
-Uh...
-[Richie humming]

16:02.927 --> 16:04.446
They were right here.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.344
And... what did I do with them?

16:08.519 --> 16:11.867
[continues singing indistinctly]

16:11.901 --> 16:14.387
Hey. What'’s this book do,
by the way?

16:14.421 --> 16:15.802
I always wondered what this was.

16:15.836 --> 16:17.217
Richie. [chuckles]

16:17.252 --> 16:18.736
[laughing]:
Don'’t touch anything.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.393
Hey.

16:20.427 --> 16:22.222
Mm.

16:22.257 --> 16:24.052
-I just said don'’t touch
anything. -These are gorgeous.

16:24.086 --> 16:25.812
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:25.846 --> 16:28.401
He likes things
the way that he likes them.

16:28.435 --> 16:30.299
Okay.

16:30.334 --> 16:32.370
What a fucking buster, huh?

16:32.405 --> 16:35.477
He cares about what he does,

16:35.511 --> 16:37.134
and that'’s why
he'’s the best at it.

16:37.168 --> 16:38.238
Yeah.

16:38.273 --> 16:41.379
Like... somebody else I know.

16:41.414 --> 16:43.347
-Hmm.
-[Mable chuckles]

16:43.381 --> 16:45.383
What is that?
Are you fucking with me?

16:45.418 --> 16:46.660
What?

16:46.695 --> 16:48.041
I said, are you fucking with me?

16:48.076 --> 16:49.870
-Like, are you making fun? Huh?
-No.

16:49.905 --> 16:51.527
-No, Richie, baby.
-'’Cause I'm no goddamn joke.

16:51.562 --> 16:53.598
I'’m not making fun.
I'’m not making fun.

16:55.290 --> 16:56.946
Come here.

16:58.086 --> 17:00.709
Baby, what'’s wrong?

17:00.743 --> 17:02.262
[sniffs]

17:02.297 --> 17:04.506
-Did he do something?
-Did who do something?

17:04.540 --> 17:06.542
Francis.
Did he do something again?

17:06.577 --> 17:08.337
RICHIE [scoffs]:
Fuck Francis.

17:08.372 --> 17:09.718
-He ain'’t family.
-I know.

17:09.752 --> 17:11.064
Hmm.

17:11.099 --> 17:12.410
-He ain'’t even Irish.
-I know.

17:12.445 --> 17:13.929
[scoffs]

17:13.963 --> 17:16.449
-He thinks we got a rat.
-[lighter clicks]

17:16.483 --> 17:18.416
-Okay.
-Yeah.

17:18.451 --> 17:20.177
Somebody leaking
to the La Fontaines.

17:20.211 --> 17:21.695
Who?

17:21.730 --> 17:23.214
Doesn'’t fucking matter.

17:23.249 --> 17:24.871
-He'’s paranoid. All right?
-All right.

17:24.905 --> 17:26.907
And he'’s been telling my pops
for months.

17:26.942 --> 17:29.220
My pops fucking listens, too.

17:29.255 --> 17:32.913
"Hey, Francis,
you know, he'’s so smart.

17:32.948 --> 17:35.088
You can really learn
a thing or two from that kid."

17:35.123 --> 17:37.470
[whispers]:
Baby, you'’re the number two.

17:37.504 --> 17:40.059
Your pops listens to you.
Don'’t worry about Francis.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.991
Who cares about Francis?

17:42.026 --> 17:46.444
You think I don'’t know what
Francis did for my pops? Hmm?

17:46.479 --> 17:48.412
You think I haven'’t heard
about it

17:48.446 --> 17:50.552
a thousand fucking times?

17:50.586 --> 17:53.279
Six marbles. I fucking get it.

17:53.313 --> 17:55.764
But that'’s only 'cause
I wasn'’t there.

17:55.798 --> 17:57.490
'’Cause if I had been there,

17:57.524 --> 17:58.594
-that would'’ve been me.
-Would'’ve been you.

17:58.629 --> 18:00.113
You know that, right?

18:00.148 --> 18:03.012
Francis thinks he can
make moves with my pops,

18:03.047 --> 18:05.256
my fucking pops,

18:05.291 --> 18:07.051
-without me.
-[clatters]

18:09.329 --> 18:11.331
Fuck was that?

18:11.366 --> 18:13.126
I don'’t...

18:22.170 --> 18:24.724
-[laughs quietly]
-[snorts]

18:26.312 --> 18:27.623
[whispering]:
Shut up.

18:27.658 --> 18:29.280
Okay. Sorry.

18:29.315 --> 18:30.799
Geez.

18:33.008 --> 18:35.735
-[chuckles softly]
-I don'’t want to wake him up.

18:37.702 --> 18:39.497
-Hey.
-[keys jingle]

18:39.532 --> 18:41.706
-Looking for these?
-That'’s where...

18:43.743 --> 18:45.469
You know what I like about you?

18:45.503 --> 18:46.677
What?

18:46.711 --> 18:48.851
You'’re going places.

18:48.886 --> 18:51.060
Goddamn right I'’m going places.

18:51.095 --> 18:53.166
Mm.

18:53.201 --> 18:54.512
-Whoa.
-Out that door.

18:54.547 --> 18:56.997
-Whoa, whoa.
-[Mable laughs]

18:57.032 --> 18:58.792
[departing footsteps]

18:58.827 --> 19:01.070
[door opens, bell jingles]

19:02.210 --> 19:03.866
[door closes]

19:08.423 --> 19:10.494
Step two is drawing.

19:13.945 --> 19:18.916
And for some, this can be
the most purely enjoyable step.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.987
[bell jingles]

19:21.021 --> 19:23.507
[sighs heavily]

19:23.541 --> 19:26.095
You'’re only just exploring.

19:39.592 --> 19:42.836
-[tablet fizzing]
-[groans quietly]

19:42.871 --> 19:45.425
[exhales slowly]

19:48.083 --> 19:51.742
But I will caution you
to heed your patterns.

19:54.641 --> 19:57.230
They'’re there for a reason.

19:58.887 --> 20:00.751
This isn'’t art.

20:00.785 --> 20:02.649
This is a craft.

20:04.272 --> 20:07.654
We can talk about
shocking originality later.

20:13.764 --> 20:15.110
The point now...

20:17.112 --> 20:18.458
...is skill.

20:24.292 --> 20:26.017
[keys jingle]

20:28.261 --> 20:30.159
[lock clicking]

20:46.417 --> 20:49.593
Your patterns,
your proven forms,

20:49.627 --> 20:51.629
they aren'’t your enemies.

20:54.632 --> 20:57.014
They'’re the only friends
you have.

21:26.733 --> 21:28.563
[doorbell rings]

21:29.667 --> 21:31.911
[doorbell ringing]

21:33.878 --> 21:35.535
[urgent knocking]

21:35.570 --> 21:37.296
[doorbell rings]

21:38.883 --> 21:40.609
-Shh!
-[bell jingles]

21:40.644 --> 21:41.679
[Richie grunts]

21:42.680 --> 21:44.820
-Motherfuckers!
-Quiet.

21:44.855 --> 21:46.305
-Fucking dead! -Quiet.
-[sirens approaching]

21:46.339 --> 21:47.478
Yeah, back up, back up.

21:49.031 --> 21:51.482
[sirens passing]

21:55.486 --> 21:57.454
[sirens continue in distance]

21:57.488 --> 21:59.352
[panting]

21:59.387 --> 22:01.285
-What'’s going on?
-Is anybody else here?

22:01.320 --> 22:02.562
Please, sirs,
I don'’t want any trouble.

22:02.597 --> 22:04.564
-[grunts]
-Is anybody else here?

22:04.599 --> 22:05.634
No, no, no, sir.

22:05.669 --> 22:06.739
All right, back room.

22:06.773 --> 22:08.154
Move, move, move. Come on.

22:08.188 --> 22:10.398
-[pained grunting]
-Let'’s go.

22:10.432 --> 22:12.676
-We got ya. Don'’t worry.
-[Richie grunts]

22:12.710 --> 22:14.643
[sirens continue in distance]

22:14.678 --> 22:17.025
Come on, English.

22:17.059 --> 22:18.267
-All right.
-[grunts]

22:20.200 --> 22:21.892
-All right.
-Shit, shit.

22:21.926 --> 22:23.376
-All right, get the coat,
get the coat. Come on. -Shit.

22:23.411 --> 22:25.551
[Richie grunts]

22:25.585 --> 22:27.587
Fuck!

22:28.519 --> 22:29.693
[softly]:
Shit.

22:31.626 --> 22:33.282
Come on, help me lift him.

22:34.525 --> 22:36.044
Come on.

22:36.078 --> 22:37.942
-[groans]
-All right.

22:37.977 --> 22:40.255
[strained]:
Fuck.

22:42.602 --> 22:44.397
Fuck.

22:44.432 --> 22:46.295
Fuck. Shit.

22:46.330 --> 22:49.264
Fuck. [yells]

22:49.298 --> 22:50.714
-Fuck.
-Grab some of that fabric,

22:50.748 --> 22:52.750
hold it, hold it up here
against the wound.

22:52.785 --> 22:54.856
Ah! Fuck! Fucking hurts!

22:54.890 --> 22:57.099
It hurts because there'’s a hole
in your stomach.

22:57.134 --> 22:59.308
Do you remember why
there'’s a hole in your stomach?

22:59.343 --> 23:01.794
There'’s a hole in your stomach
because back there,

23:01.828 --> 23:04.624
when it was time for you
to pull the trigger, you froze.

23:04.659 --> 23:05.867
-Fuck you.
-Yeah, fuck me later.

23:05.901 --> 23:07.316
Right now, shut up.

23:08.456 --> 23:10.768
English, I need you
to listen carefully.

23:10.803 --> 23:12.598
There are a thousand
blue boys out there

23:12.632 --> 23:15.911
hunting for this, and if they
find it, I start shooting.

23:15.946 --> 23:17.741
You follow?
Making matters worse,

23:17.775 --> 23:19.432
there are a thousand
racket boys out there

23:19.467 --> 23:21.054
hunting for it, too,
and if they find it,

23:21.089 --> 23:22.815
they start shooting.
You follow?

23:22.849 --> 23:23.988
-I think he fucking gets it.
-Shut up.

23:24.023 --> 23:25.576
Let me hear it.

23:25.611 --> 23:27.578
Uh, there'’s, there's
a thousand people

23:27.613 --> 23:29.442
looking for that briefcase.

23:29.477 --> 23:32.928
It would be safest all around
if none of '’em get it.

23:32.963 --> 23:34.482
Good man.

23:34.516 --> 23:35.759
Keep the pressure on.

23:36.484 --> 23:37.795
Fuck.

23:38.693 --> 23:41.143
Are you calling my pops?

23:41.178 --> 23:42.317
Hey, prick!

23:42.351 --> 23:45.009
You fucking prick. Fuck.

23:45.044 --> 23:46.977
[pained grunting]

23:48.496 --> 23:51.015
Boss, the La Fontaines
jumped us.

23:51.050 --> 23:52.776
The whole crew was waiting.

23:52.810 --> 23:54.294
-They knew when we were gonna
be there... -[groans]

23:54.329 --> 23:55.261
-Fuck. -...they knew
what we had with us,

23:55.295 --> 23:57.159
they knew where we were.

23:57.194 --> 23:59.610
What have I been saying
about a rat?

23:59.645 --> 24:01.474
I told you.

24:01.509 --> 24:04.788
Yeah, yeah.
No, no, we still have it.

24:06.479 --> 24:10.276
Uh, no, Richie and I ran
to the safest place nearby.

24:10.310 --> 24:11.657
Tailor'’s shop.

24:11.691 --> 24:14.798
And, uh, yeah,
Richie took a marble.

24:14.832 --> 24:16.972
Yeah, well, he, he'’s not
gonna be playing for the Cubs

24:17.007 --> 24:19.665
anytime soon,
but he-he'’ll, he'll be okay.

24:19.699 --> 24:22.840
I... He'’ll be okay.

24:22.875 --> 24:24.911
You want to send the doc anyway?

24:26.913 --> 24:28.328
Well, w-we, we can come.

24:29.398 --> 24:31.021
Now?

24:31.055 --> 24:33.679
All of La Fontaine'’s spots?
That'’s war.

24:35.991 --> 24:38.200
Then I guess it'’s D-Day.

24:39.029 --> 24:40.340
[hangs up receiver]

24:41.721 --> 24:43.205
-Fuck he say?
-Listen to me, pal.

24:44.724 --> 24:46.415
Nobody knows where the doc is.

24:46.450 --> 24:48.245
Pops is gonna come
down here himself,

24:48.279 --> 24:49.626
but it'’s gonna take a while.

24:49.660 --> 24:51.179
What the f... fuck is a while?

24:51.213 --> 24:53.181
-Take me home.
-Pops says wait here.

24:53.215 --> 24:55.839
When you got marbles in your
belly, you can stay, all right?

24:55.873 --> 24:57.357
-I'’m leaving.
-Hey, hey.

24:57.392 --> 24:58.393
I'’ve had marbles in my belly,
remember?

24:58.427 --> 24:59.636
Six shots. Fuck you!

24:59.670 --> 25:01.327
You work for me, and I'’m saying

25:01.361 --> 25:02.535
take me the fuck home!

25:02.570 --> 25:03.847
I work for your father,

25:03.881 --> 25:05.227
and your father says
we stay put.

25:05.262 --> 25:07.333
Motherfuck... [cries out]

25:07.367 --> 25:09.093
Fuck!

25:09.128 --> 25:10.543
He needs a doctor.

25:10.578 --> 25:12.269
-Oh, you think?
-[sirens approaching]

25:12.303 --> 25:14.892
[Richie groaning loudly]

25:14.927 --> 25:16.653
-Fuck! [muffled shout]
-Down here.

25:16.687 --> 25:18.033
-Move, move!
-Shh!

25:18.068 --> 25:20.760
-[muffled grunting]
-[sirens passing]

25:20.795 --> 25:22.348
[sirens fading in distance]

25:22.382 --> 25:24.695
-[Richie breathing rapidly]
-[shushes softly]

25:25.696 --> 25:27.284
You fucking prick.

25:27.318 --> 25:29.079
-He'’s losing too much blood.
-Push harder.

25:29.113 --> 25:30.839
The wound needs to be sealed.

25:30.874 --> 25:32.392
Oh, are you a doctor now, too?

25:32.427 --> 25:34.463
-I was in the war.
-At your age?

25:34.498 --> 25:35.948
The other war.

25:35.982 --> 25:38.398
[shallow breathing]

25:38.433 --> 25:40.297
Let me see.

25:41.091 --> 25:42.920
[Richie grunting]

25:42.955 --> 25:44.681
Yeah, the marble went through.

25:44.715 --> 25:47.580
I'’ve been in a war, too,
just not the overseas kind.

25:47.615 --> 25:49.375
-[Richie grunts, groans]
-Yeah.

25:49.409 --> 25:52.274
We have to stop this bleeding.
He needs a hospital.

25:52.309 --> 25:53.586
Sew him up.

25:53.621 --> 25:55.277
What?

25:55.312 --> 25:57.107
You got a needle and thread
around here someplace.

25:57.141 --> 25:59.419
-Not that kind.
-Sew him up.

25:59.454 --> 26:01.042
I can'’t. I don't know how.

26:01.076 --> 26:03.078
Sewing skin is not the same...

26:04.493 --> 26:05.943
Sew him up.

26:06.979 --> 26:10.120
[coughing weakly]

26:15.332 --> 26:16.989
If he'’s bleeding internally...

26:18.956 --> 26:21.027
[coughing weakly]

26:21.856 --> 26:24.099
[Richie groaning]

26:25.825 --> 26:28.034
[Richie coughing]

26:29.657 --> 26:32.073
[groans loudly]
Fuck.

26:32.107 --> 26:34.316
[coughing]

26:36.042 --> 26:38.320
[Richie grunting]

26:38.355 --> 26:40.529
Shh.

26:41.461 --> 26:43.118
RICHIE [whispers]:
Fuck.

26:43.153 --> 26:45.017
[groaning] Fuck.

26:45.051 --> 26:46.915
What... the fuck is he doing?

26:46.950 --> 26:48.365
He'’s fixing you up. Stay still.

26:48.399 --> 26:49.746
No fucking way, he isn'’t.

26:49.780 --> 26:51.264
No, no, no, no, no, no.

26:51.299 --> 26:53.542
I think we should,
uh, we-we can, um...

26:53.577 --> 26:55.027
Go on, do it quick.

26:55.061 --> 26:56.166
...come up with
a different plan, yeah?

26:56.200 --> 26:57.616
Shh.

26:59.031 --> 27:01.412
Actually, I think I'’m good.

27:05.209 --> 27:06.659
-[yells]
-Hold him.

27:06.694 --> 27:08.661
-Nuh-uh.
-Fuck.

27:08.696 --> 27:10.767
If I run away,
you can run after me,

27:10.801 --> 27:12.838
catch me and murder me then.

27:15.426 --> 27:18.119
-Keep your hands steady.
-Get the fuck...

27:18.153 --> 27:19.499
fuck away from me, both of you.

27:19.534 --> 27:21.053
Right, come on.

27:21.087 --> 27:22.641
[grunting]

27:22.675 --> 27:24.056
Pull him this way.

27:24.090 --> 27:25.333
[grunting]

27:30.062 --> 27:31.235
[groans]

27:32.064 --> 27:33.582
Ow! Fuck!

27:35.550 --> 27:36.585
[groans]

27:40.451 --> 27:42.143
One more.

27:42.177 --> 27:44.559
[grunts] Fuck!

27:46.216 --> 27:48.736
Fuck! [grunts]

27:48.770 --> 27:50.185
Get my, get my tweezers.

27:51.704 --> 27:53.119
[Richie gasping]

27:55.432 --> 27:56.847
[breathing softly]

28:01.127 --> 28:02.922
Scissors.

28:04.372 --> 28:06.201
Cut that.

28:06.236 --> 28:07.755
[Richie grunts softly]

28:08.756 --> 28:10.136
All right.

28:11.551 --> 28:13.415
Turn him over.

28:15.107 --> 28:16.902
Careful, careful.

28:26.463 --> 28:27.809
[muffled]:
Good boy.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.233
Scissors.

28:41.167 --> 28:42.997
[Francis sighs]

28:52.351 --> 28:54.733
He'’ll be okay.

29:09.851 --> 29:12.923
[scissors snipping]

29:22.036 --> 29:23.727
[water gurgling]

29:39.639 --> 29:41.814
Stay here with Richie,
wait for the boss.

29:41.849 --> 29:43.436
You'’re leaving?

29:43.471 --> 29:44.783
I'’ll be back.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.716
Take Master Richie with you.

29:48.683 --> 29:50.443
This is the safest place
right now.

29:50.478 --> 29:53.205
Please, at least take
that-that thing with you.

29:53.239 --> 29:54.516
Too many hard boys out there.

29:54.551 --> 29:56.518
You-You'’ve been loyal customers.

29:56.553 --> 29:58.348
I depend upon you.

29:58.382 --> 30:01.869
Not once, not once have I ever
asked about your business.

30:01.903 --> 30:03.802
I don'’t, I don't judge.

30:03.836 --> 30:07.391
I just don'’t want to be involved
in whatever it is you do.

30:15.434 --> 30:19.852
English, you know exactly
what it is that we do.

30:19.887 --> 30:23.200
No, sir, I-I actually
don'’t know anything.

30:23.235 --> 30:25.133
I don'’t know what that is.

30:25.168 --> 30:28.033
I don'’t know why all these
gentlemen are looking for it.

30:28.067 --> 30:29.897
And if they come here,
I won'’t be able

30:29.931 --> 30:32.106
to placate their suspicions.

30:33.107 --> 30:35.695
I'’m useless to you.
I'’m a liability.

30:35.730 --> 30:39.354
I... I only just want
to be left alone.

30:46.948 --> 30:49.882
But you'’re not alone, English.

30:49.917 --> 30:53.541
Like it or not,
now you'’re part of the family.

30:56.475 --> 30:58.201
This is a tape from a bug.

30:58.235 --> 30:59.616
Oh, please, stop.

30:59.650 --> 31:01.825
Some new gizmo
the Feds came up with.

31:02.930 --> 31:05.898
Records sound, like a Victrola.

31:05.933 --> 31:09.591
But you can hide it, '’cause
it'’s only the size of a...

31:09.626 --> 31:11.386
Oh, you get it.

31:11.421 --> 31:16.426
The Hoover boys planted
their bug in one of our spots.

31:16.460 --> 31:17.910
But what they don'’t know

31:17.945 --> 31:20.016
is that we have friends
in high places.

31:20.050 --> 31:24.883
Friends who could do things like
smuggle us a copy of the tape.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.608
But before I could listen to it,

31:26.643 --> 31:28.438
La Fontaine'’s crew
rolls up on us.

31:28.472 --> 31:30.889
See, we'’re making moves on them,
and if they get the tape,

31:30.923 --> 31:32.476
then they'’ll know
how to hit back.

31:32.511 --> 31:33.753
Everybody wants this thing.

31:33.788 --> 31:36.584
So throw it away.

31:36.618 --> 31:38.897
Somebody'’s been ratting us out
to La Fontaine.

31:38.931 --> 31:41.106
Now, somebody...

31:41.140 --> 31:44.385
helped the Feds get a bug on us.

31:44.419 --> 31:46.145
If we can listen to this thing,

31:46.180 --> 31:48.630
then we'’ll know
where it was planted. Boom.

31:48.665 --> 31:52.220
If I can find a machine
to play this tape tonight,

31:52.255 --> 31:55.085
the rat don'’t wake up tomorrow.

31:56.604 --> 31:59.055
Your friend, Mr. Boyle,
will be here in three hours.

31:59.089 --> 32:01.057
Nobody but me or the big man
touches this.

32:01.091 --> 32:03.128
-What if the police come?
-Get rid of '’em.

32:03.162 --> 32:04.405
What if these
other gentlemen come?

32:04.439 --> 32:05.440
Get rid of '’em!

32:07.166 --> 32:08.788
'’Cause if I get back

32:08.823 --> 32:11.619
and that tape isn'’t
sitting right there...

32:15.002 --> 32:17.038
Welcome to the family.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.250
[door closes]

32:22.285 --> 32:24.528
[door opens, bell jingles]

32:24.563 --> 32:26.392
[door closes]

33:11.265 --> 33:13.681
-[Richie coughing]
-[door sliding open]

33:14.958 --> 33:16.546
[sighs]

33:18.272 --> 33:20.412
[sighs, grunts]

33:20.446 --> 33:22.414
Master Richie.

33:23.242 --> 33:24.657
How are you feeling?

33:24.692 --> 33:26.901
Fuck you.
How you think I'’m feeling?

33:26.935 --> 33:28.592
Unwell.

33:28.627 --> 33:30.008
[Richie scoffs]

33:32.907 --> 33:35.013
Listen, uh...

33:36.980 --> 33:39.431
English, I want to thank you.

33:40.949 --> 33:43.055
You saved my life, so...

33:43.090 --> 33:44.746
I don'’t know that I did, sir.

33:44.781 --> 33:46.610
No, no, no.

33:46.645 --> 33:48.957
Came to you in a bad moment.

33:50.407 --> 33:53.031
You were a stand-up guy.

33:54.411 --> 33:56.034
Water?

33:56.068 --> 33:58.174
Sure.

33:58.208 --> 33:59.623
Yeah.

34:10.427 --> 34:11.670
[exhales painfully]

34:12.671 --> 34:15.432
[sighs] Where'’s Francis?

34:15.467 --> 34:17.779
He, he said he had to find a way

34:17.814 --> 34:19.436
-to play your tape.
-[water running]

34:21.438 --> 34:23.647
What do you mean, he left?

34:23.682 --> 34:27.548
Uh, something about how playing
the tape would tell him, uh,

34:27.582 --> 34:28.963
who the rat is.

34:28.997 --> 34:32.208
That'’s what you call it,
isn'’t it?

34:32.242 --> 34:33.657
-A rat?
-Hmm.

34:33.692 --> 34:36.074
Francis told you that?

34:37.005 --> 34:38.662
Mm.

34:38.697 --> 34:41.907
He'’s just not usually
the type to get blabby.

34:41.941 --> 34:44.116
Well, it sounds like
it'’s been a long night.

34:44.151 --> 34:46.670
-For us all.
-Yeah.

34:49.466 --> 34:51.089
S-Slowly with that.

34:51.123 --> 34:52.538
I got it.

34:53.781 --> 34:56.094
Who would do such a thing
to your family?

34:57.543 --> 35:01.444
After everything your father'’s
done for this neighborhood.

35:02.617 --> 35:05.137
My pops is
this fucking neighborhood.

35:05.172 --> 35:06.690
Indeed.

35:15.872 --> 35:19.255
When I first came to Chicago,

35:19.289 --> 35:22.603
all I had to me name
was a set of shears.

35:22.637 --> 35:25.985
Your father, did you know
he was my very first customer?

35:26.020 --> 35:27.677
Very first.

35:28.643 --> 35:30.058
Yeah, I remember that.

35:30.093 --> 35:32.475
-Do you?
-Yeah.

35:32.509 --> 35:33.821
Pops was excited.

35:33.855 --> 35:36.168
He, uh...
[chuckles softly]

35:36.203 --> 35:38.066
came home one day
saying, you know,

35:38.101 --> 35:39.620
"There'’s a new tailor in town."

35:39.654 --> 35:41.484
-Did he?
-Yeah, "Right from England."

35:41.518 --> 35:43.002
[both chuckle]

35:43.037 --> 35:44.694
It was a very warm welcome,
I tell you.

35:44.728 --> 35:46.005
Yeah.

35:46.040 --> 35:48.007
Much appreciated.
[clears throat]

35:48.042 --> 35:49.975
Pops loves all that
fancy stuff, you know.

35:50.009 --> 35:52.219
-He does. He'’s got good taste.
-Mm-hmm.

35:53.944 --> 35:56.706
You know that he...
he taught me how to tie a tie

35:56.740 --> 35:58.466
for the first time
when I was four.

35:58.501 --> 35:59.743
-No.
-Mm-hmm.

35:59.778 --> 36:00.917
Four?

36:00.951 --> 36:03.540
What was he always saying? Uh...

36:03.575 --> 36:05.197
"A well-tied tie is the, uh,

36:05.232 --> 36:06.681
first serious step
in life, kid."

36:06.716 --> 36:08.304
Some shit like that.

36:08.338 --> 36:11.203
-Wilde.
-Mm, fucking crazy, right?

36:11.238 --> 36:13.171
No, that'’s a quote.

36:13.205 --> 36:15.034
Oscar Wilde.

36:15.069 --> 36:17.105
Yeah, I don'’t know him.
[sniffs]

36:17.140 --> 36:19.384
But see, that'’s probably why
my pops likes you, though.

36:19.418 --> 36:23.111
You know, he'’s into all that
quoting fancy people shit.

36:23.146 --> 36:24.975
[chuckles softly]

36:29.980 --> 36:31.948
So, who do you think it is?

36:31.982 --> 36:33.501
Who do I think is who?

36:33.536 --> 36:35.779
This Judas
who'’s betrayed your family.

36:35.814 --> 36:37.919
I don'’t know.

36:40.715 --> 36:45.272
I'’ll wager
a clever young man like yourself

36:45.306 --> 36:48.102
must have some suspicions.

36:48.136 --> 36:52.934
Someone close to the family,
perhaps, but, but not family.

36:59.631 --> 37:03.255
I have something I need
to tell you, Master Richie.

37:03.290 --> 37:05.084
Okay.

37:06.810 --> 37:08.605
I feel terrible.

37:10.089 --> 37:12.057
I-I never imagined

37:12.091 --> 37:14.784
things would get
so out of control.

37:17.511 --> 37:22.585
That anyone would be harmed,
much less yourself,

37:22.619 --> 37:26.796
or... or, God forbid,
your father.

37:28.176 --> 37:29.557
But...

37:29.592 --> 37:31.835
The fuck are you
talking about, English?

37:33.768 --> 37:37.116
I... I have to tell...

37:38.221 --> 37:39.567
I have to tell you...

37:39.602 --> 37:41.293
Spit it out.

37:48.473 --> 37:50.268
I'’m the rat.

37:53.995 --> 37:57.965
I'’ve been selling information
to your enemies.

38:00.001 --> 38:03.591
And I let the Federal Bureau
of Investigation

38:03.626 --> 38:07.354
plant their bug... here.

38:19.227 --> 38:21.402
[laughing]

38:23.059 --> 38:25.061
Holy shit, you had me.

38:25.095 --> 38:27.201
You fucking had me.

38:27.235 --> 38:29.307
[both laughing]

38:33.897 --> 38:35.347
I almost fucking shot you.

38:35.382 --> 38:37.832
[laughing]:
I felt it.

38:37.867 --> 38:39.524
I made you laugh.

38:39.558 --> 38:41.974
It'’s a hell of a thing
to joke about. [laughing]

38:42.009 --> 38:43.528
Well, it'’s the best medicine,
you know.

38:43.562 --> 38:44.632
It is.

38:44.667 --> 38:47.221
Can you imagine, huh?

38:47.255 --> 38:49.913
You... the rat?

38:49.948 --> 38:51.846
[laughing]

38:51.881 --> 38:53.331
Wait a minute.

38:53.365 --> 38:54.573
What do you mean by that?

38:54.608 --> 38:55.885
[inhales sharply]

38:55.919 --> 38:58.163
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

38:58.197 --> 39:00.096
You couldn'’t be the rat.

39:00.130 --> 39:02.581
I absolutely could be the rat.

39:02.616 --> 39:04.721
-Not a chance.
-Why not?

39:04.756 --> 39:06.861
Why? '’Cause look at you.

39:06.896 --> 39:07.931
What about me?

39:07.966 --> 39:09.588
[laughs]

39:09.623 --> 39:10.934
Nah, uh-uh.

39:10.969 --> 39:13.212
You'’re just a fucking tailor.

39:16.457 --> 39:18.425
[sniffs]
I'’m not a tailor.

39:18.459 --> 39:19.736
I'’m a cutter.

39:19.771 --> 39:21.945
-Sorry.
-A tailor sews on buttons

39:21.980 --> 39:23.947
and hems trousers.

39:23.982 --> 39:28.607
Anyone with a needle and thread
and 15 minutes can be a tailor.

39:28.642 --> 39:31.438
I studied for decades
to be a cutter.

39:31.472 --> 39:34.372
I used to cut on the Row.

39:34.406 --> 39:36.719
-Fuck is "the Row"?
-Savile Row.

39:36.753 --> 39:38.790
Where'’s that, North Addison?

39:38.824 --> 39:40.378
It'’s in London.

39:40.412 --> 39:42.932
A quarter of a mile in which

39:42.966 --> 39:45.900
the greatest craftsmen
in the world

39:45.935 --> 39:47.799
all ply their trade.

39:47.833 --> 39:52.597
I apprenticed there for years
before they allowed me...

39:54.012 --> 39:55.807
...to open my own shop.

39:56.946 --> 40:00.156
-Why'’d you come here, then?
-The war.

40:00.190 --> 40:01.709
What, Krauts bomb your place?

40:01.744 --> 40:04.263
Worse.
They'’re called blue jeans.

40:04.298 --> 40:05.989
[stifled laugh]

40:06.024 --> 40:07.405
-[coughs]
-After the war,

40:07.439 --> 40:09.993
things were quite poor
in England.

40:10.028 --> 40:13.238
Not a lot of men
could afford well-made things,

40:13.272 --> 40:16.966
so these blue jeans
became all the rage.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.451
Well, times change, pal.

40:19.486 --> 40:21.280
Blue jeans are the fashion now.

40:21.315 --> 40:24.491
This James Dean of yours
makes one picture

40:24.525 --> 40:26.009
and blue jeans are the fashion.

40:26.044 --> 40:27.666
Soon he'’ll make another,

40:27.701 --> 40:29.944
something else
will become popular.

40:29.979 --> 40:33.292
These fashionable things,
they don'’t last.

40:33.327 --> 40:35.329
The things I make,

40:35.363 --> 40:37.469
-like that suit of yours...
-Mm.

40:37.504 --> 40:38.815
...it'’s timeless.

40:40.299 --> 40:42.854
So you thought that a bunch
of fancy-pants in England

40:42.888 --> 40:44.511
couldn'’t appreciate
the finer things,

40:44.545 --> 40:47.306
so you came to Chicago?

40:48.825 --> 40:51.897
Wow. You must fucking
love Red Hots.

40:53.036 --> 40:56.523
I came to a place
that isn'’t weighed down...

40:59.733 --> 41:01.182
...with bitter history.

41:02.529 --> 41:03.875
And, yes,

41:03.909 --> 41:06.084
-Red Hots are delicious.
-[chuckles]

41:10.916 --> 41:13.367
[laughs]

41:27.277 --> 41:29.176
I do hope
your cousin'’s all right.

41:29.935 --> 41:31.212
My cousin?

41:32.075 --> 41:34.181
[doorbell ringing]

41:34.215 --> 41:35.872
[bell jingles]

41:35.907 --> 41:38.357
-How is he?
-Awake.

41:38.392 --> 41:40.498
But...

41:40.532 --> 41:42.569
Francis ain'’t my goddamn cousin.

41:42.603 --> 41:44.709
He'’s not?

41:44.743 --> 41:45.917
But what?

41:45.951 --> 41:47.401
What'’s the matter with him?

41:47.435 --> 41:49.541
Come on, spit it out.

41:49.576 --> 41:52.268
My pops can see the
mangiest mutt on the street,

41:52.302 --> 41:54.822
and if he'’s got teeth
sharp enough,

41:54.857 --> 41:57.273
he'’ll be eating with us
at the dinner table.

41:57.307 --> 41:59.551
He'’s lost a lot of blood.

41:59.586 --> 42:02.381
He'’s probably light in the head.

42:04.383 --> 42:06.558
[sighs]

42:11.149 --> 42:13.427
Where did Francis say
he was going exactly?

42:13.461 --> 42:18.121
Oh, no, you can'’t think
he has anything to do with this.

42:18.156 --> 42:20.572
It'’s not my place to speak ill
of Master Richie,

42:20.607 --> 42:24.921
but he keeps going on about
this rat you mentioned.

42:24.956 --> 42:26.613
What about the rat?

42:26.647 --> 42:29.926
He said before, he was the one
looking for the rat.

42:29.961 --> 42:34.724
Why would he place himself
in charge of looking for the rat

42:34.759 --> 42:37.451
if he was the rat himself?

42:37.485 --> 42:39.073
So he told you all that,

42:39.108 --> 42:41.213
but he didn'’t tell you
where he was going?

42:41.248 --> 42:44.078
"I know who the rat is,"
he says.

42:44.113 --> 42:46.391
"Francis thinks
he can pull one over on me."

42:46.425 --> 42:48.393
-Who, me?
-Well.

42:48.427 --> 42:51.569
He keeps fiddling
with your briefcase.

42:53.605 --> 42:55.780
-What did he do to the case?
-Nothing.

42:55.814 --> 42:57.885
He left the case in there.

42:57.920 --> 42:59.162
If I was the rat...

43:00.474 --> 43:03.166
...and try as I might,
I can'’t seem to convince you

43:03.201 --> 43:05.410
that I am...

43:05.444 --> 43:07.412
[chuckles]

43:07.446 --> 43:10.277
...well, I'’d want to burn
that thing straightaway.

43:10.311 --> 43:15.282
So, you see, you'’ve nothing to
fear from your friend Francis.

43:16.766 --> 43:18.803
He'’s family.

43:20.149 --> 43:21.599
Well, almost.

43:23.152 --> 43:24.636
[doorbell rings]

43:24.671 --> 43:26.776
I haven'’t left him.

43:26.811 --> 43:28.122
Till now.

43:28.157 --> 43:30.918
[doorbell ringing]

43:30.953 --> 43:33.783
[quietly]:
English, get the door.

43:38.857 --> 43:41.066
[doorbell ringing]

43:50.351 --> 43:51.629
Richie.

43:52.595 --> 43:53.596
How you feeling?

43:54.666 --> 43:56.668
Oh, I'’m just peachy, yeah.

43:56.703 --> 43:58.187
How you feeling?

43:58.221 --> 43:59.706
I didn'’t get shot
in the stomach earlier,

43:59.740 --> 44:00.948
so, you know, not bad.

44:00.983 --> 44:02.605
Lucky, isn'’t it?

44:02.640 --> 44:04.849
All those bullets flying around,
but the La Fontaines,

44:04.883 --> 44:07.161
they didn'’t land
a single one on you, hmm?

44:07.196 --> 44:09.163
Not luck, Richie. It'’s, um...

44:10.199 --> 44:11.683
...it'’s skill.

44:11.718 --> 44:13.789
I guess I was too slow.

44:13.823 --> 44:15.445
So where you been?

44:16.619 --> 44:18.586
Made some calls.

44:18.621 --> 44:21.037
I checked in with a hi-fi shop,
owes us a favor.

44:21.072 --> 44:22.901
They got a machine
that can play the tape.

44:22.936 --> 44:25.697
I'’m, I'm gonna go over
with it this minute.

44:25.732 --> 44:27.250
So you want to take the tape?

44:27.285 --> 44:29.356
Yeah. Pronto.

44:30.288 --> 44:32.739
-Why don'’t I go with you.
-No, no.

44:32.773 --> 44:35.017
You'’re in no shape
to be out there.

44:35.051 --> 44:37.675
So you want to walk out of here
with this tape alone?

44:37.709 --> 44:40.436
-Is that right?
-That'’s right.

44:40.470 --> 44:41.713
[sucks lip]

44:41.748 --> 44:43.094
I'’ll tell you what.

44:44.302 --> 44:46.062
Just wait for my pops
to get here, you know?

44:46.097 --> 44:48.064
Then we can all listen
to the tape together.

44:48.099 --> 44:50.170
We don'’t have time.

44:50.204 --> 44:52.862
-What'’s the big rush?
-Every second the rat is alive

44:52.897 --> 44:55.520
is another second
that your father is in danger.

44:55.554 --> 44:57.625
Gentlemen.

44:57.660 --> 45:00.111
[clears throat]

45:00.145 --> 45:02.734
If I know your father,
Master Richie,

45:02.769 --> 45:06.704
your father would want you both
to take a deep breath.

45:08.153 --> 45:11.122
Now... glad you said that.

45:11.156 --> 45:12.779
Hmm?

45:12.813 --> 45:14.056
My father.

45:16.783 --> 45:18.646
My father, Francis.

45:20.614 --> 45:23.237
It'’s my father
who'’s in danger, not yours.

45:23.272 --> 45:25.136
I love your father
like he was my own

45:25.170 --> 45:26.758
and I'’m trying to help him.

45:26.793 --> 45:28.933
See, wasn'’t your father

45:30.072 --> 45:32.626
selling fucking tomatoes
down on State Street

45:32.660 --> 45:37.286
before he died from a lifetime
of being nothing to nobody?

45:37.320 --> 45:39.150
Huh?

45:39.184 --> 45:42.256
So maybe me and my pops
don'’t need your fucking help.

45:42.291 --> 45:43.775
You ever think of that?

45:49.643 --> 45:51.679
I'’m gonna need that tape, pal,
right now.

45:51.714 --> 45:53.751
[Richie grunts]

45:54.821 --> 45:57.168
Why don'’t you try and take it?

45:57.202 --> 45:58.686
Not tonight.
Now give me the tape.

45:58.721 --> 46:00.688
Really, Francis,
I mean, what'’s the, uh,

46:00.723 --> 46:02.276
what'’s the rush?

46:02.311 --> 46:05.555
I mean, really, my pops
will be here any minute.

46:06.936 --> 46:10.353
Unless you don'’t want my pops
listening to this tape.

46:10.388 --> 46:12.321
[scoffs]
What are you talking about?

46:13.943 --> 46:15.945
Huh?

46:15.980 --> 46:18.637
Why don'’t you want my pops
listening to this tape, Francis?

46:19.742 --> 46:21.571
I said, give me
the fucking tape.

46:22.676 --> 46:24.022
Ooh.

46:25.196 --> 46:27.715
Now who'’s too fucking slow?

46:30.235 --> 46:32.272
-Richie.
-Mm?

46:32.306 --> 46:36.034
Richie, for your own good,
for the good of your father,

46:36.069 --> 46:40.867
I'’m gonna take that tape now
and I'’m gonna leave.

46:40.901 --> 46:42.869
If you touch me again...

46:45.181 --> 46:47.874
...I'’ll break your fucking arm,
you understand?

46:47.908 --> 46:50.152
[laughing]

46:51.981 --> 46:55.088
You'’re such a fucking prick,
you know that?

46:56.365 --> 46:58.022
Think you'’re so fucking smart.

46:58.056 --> 46:59.644
-Careful.
-Hmm?

46:59.678 --> 47:01.508
-Smarter than everyone.
-Careful, Master Richie.

47:01.542 --> 47:03.234
-Careful.
-Eh?

47:05.236 --> 47:07.238
-You fucking...
-[grunting]

47:19.906 --> 47:22.080
Where'’s the tape, Francis?

47:22.115 --> 47:23.875
You must be out of your mind
to point that gun at me.

47:23.910 --> 47:25.670
Gentlemen.

47:25.704 --> 47:27.706
Stop playing games, Richie.
Where'’d you put the tape?

47:27.741 --> 47:29.916
-What was your plan?
-Did you hide it to try

47:29.950 --> 47:31.227
and trick me
into confessing something?

47:31.262 --> 47:32.711
'’Cause that is somehow

47:32.746 --> 47:34.541
the dumbest thing
you'’ve done all day.

47:34.575 --> 47:36.439
Mm. Always wanted to be
the big man, didn'’t you?

47:36.474 --> 47:39.580
No selling tomatoes for you.
No, no, no.

47:39.615 --> 47:40.927
You don'’t want to work
for my pops.

47:40.961 --> 47:42.204
You want to fucking be him.

47:42.238 --> 47:43.757
I owe everything to that man.

47:43.791 --> 47:45.103
Well, guess what.

47:45.138 --> 47:46.553
As long as me and him
are around,

47:46.587 --> 47:48.003
you ain'’t never gonna be
number one.

47:48.037 --> 47:50.212
There'’s no need
for this fighting.

47:50.246 --> 47:51.765
You slimy fuck,
I had you pegged from day one.

47:51.799 --> 47:53.560
You know that?

47:53.594 --> 47:57.909
From the second I first
laid eyes on you, I said,

47:57.944 --> 48:02.362
"Who the fuck
is this son of a bitch?"

48:02.396 --> 48:04.191
He ain'’t family.

48:04.226 --> 48:06.124
No, I'’m the guy
who took six marbles

48:06.159 --> 48:09.196
to save your father'’s life
because family wasn'’t there.

48:09.231 --> 48:10.784
Yeah, fuck you!

48:10.818 --> 48:13.545
-I run this crew.
-No, your pops runs this crew.

48:13.580 --> 48:16.376
And I spend half of every day
cleaning up your messes.

48:16.410 --> 48:17.929
[gun cocks]

48:17.964 --> 48:19.931
You want to see me make a mess?

48:22.313 --> 48:23.831
[scoffs softly]

48:26.248 --> 48:27.180
[clank]

48:33.117 --> 48:34.877
[gun drops to floor]

48:35.982 --> 48:38.674
[choking]

48:44.818 --> 48:46.682
[choking continues]

48:49.305 --> 48:51.342
Damn it, Richie.
Why'’d you make me do that?

48:51.376 --> 48:53.620
[choking continues]

49:01.628 --> 49:04.079
These are the last words
you'’re gonna hear,

49:04.113 --> 49:06.909
so I hope you remember them
in hell.

49:08.669 --> 49:10.775
You didn'’t die
because you'’re dumb,

49:10.809 --> 49:13.364
because you'’re arrogant
or because you'’re slow.

49:17.333 --> 49:18.990
It was because you'’re weak.

49:25.307 --> 49:27.240
[gunshot echoes]

49:43.049 --> 49:44.671
You killed him.

49:48.261 --> 49:50.401
You really pay attention,
don'’t you?

49:55.682 --> 49:58.961
-Where did Richie put the tape?
-I'’ve no idea.

50:01.067 --> 50:04.242
Maybe you could explain
what happened.

50:04.277 --> 50:06.486
To God Almighty?

50:06.520 --> 50:08.039
No, to Mr. Boyle.

50:08.074 --> 50:09.696
There'’s a difference?

50:10.938 --> 50:12.975
He had to hide it
in here somewhere.

50:16.358 --> 50:18.429
You brought a man
in here injured.

50:18.463 --> 50:21.121
Perhaps he didn'’t survive
his wounds.

50:22.605 --> 50:24.331
He'’s missing
half his goddamned head.

50:24.366 --> 50:26.782
On the phone,
I told his father he'’d be fine.

50:27.955 --> 50:30.234
When a mistake has been made...

50:31.821 --> 50:35.722
...I'’ve always found it best
to simply be up-front about it.

50:35.756 --> 50:38.518
English, I didn'’t cut
the boss'’s pants too short.

50:38.552 --> 50:40.106
I shot his son in the face.

50:40.140 --> 50:42.211
[vehicle approaching]

50:42.246 --> 50:44.731
-Shit.
-[dog barking in distance]

50:44.765 --> 50:46.457
That'’s the man's Caddy.

50:46.491 --> 50:48.217
-Let'’s explain...
-Open the trunk.

50:48.252 --> 50:50.392
-What? -Open the trunk
and-and grab his arms.

50:50.426 --> 50:52.290
-What you gonna do with him?
-[vehicle doors closing]

50:52.325 --> 50:54.810
Grab his goddamned arms
or else I'’m hiding two bodies.

50:54.844 --> 50:57.813
-[doorbell ringing]
-[grunting]

50:59.677 --> 51:01.230
Go. Get the door.

51:01.265 --> 51:02.956
Take your sweet time
bringing him back here.

51:02.990 --> 51:04.785
I need to clean this up.

51:07.961 --> 51:11.137
[doorbell ringing]

51:11.171 --> 51:13.760
I don'’t know anything
about lying.

51:13.794 --> 51:15.210
Subterfuge.

51:15.244 --> 51:16.383
You don'’t know
how to say one thing

51:16.418 --> 51:18.730
when you mean something else?

51:18.765 --> 51:20.249
I thought you were English.

51:20.284 --> 51:22.803
-[doorbell ringing]
-[door sliding open]

51:29.465 --> 51:30.915
[sighs]

51:30.949 --> 51:34.608
[doorbell ringing]

51:38.785 --> 51:41.822
[doorbell ringing]

51:48.553 --> 51:51.177
-[bell jingles]
-[wind whistling]

51:51.211 --> 51:54.283
Well, aren'’t you
a sight for sore eyes.

51:58.080 --> 51:59.840
-You'’re in one piece?
-Mm.

51:59.875 --> 52:01.566
-[door creaks]
-[bell jingles]

52:03.672 --> 52:06.502
I'’m not gonna forget
what you'’re doing for my crew,

52:06.537 --> 52:08.297
my family, tonight.

52:08.332 --> 52:09.988
I'’m at your service, sir.

52:12.853 --> 52:14.131
[chuckles softly]

52:14.165 --> 52:15.477
Where are the boys?

52:15.511 --> 52:17.824
Are we quite
all in one piece, sir?

52:20.067 --> 52:21.414
Oh, it'’s not mine.

52:22.932 --> 52:25.003
We had to make
a few stops on the way.

52:27.178 --> 52:28.697
Where are the boys?

52:39.949 --> 52:41.503
Boss.

52:41.537 --> 52:42.883
You all right?

52:44.402 --> 52:46.680
You must have made it
through some hell.

52:46.715 --> 52:48.717
Hey, nothing I haven'’t
seen before.

52:48.751 --> 52:52.376
First you save my life
and then you save my son'’s.

52:52.410 --> 52:55.517
One of these days, I'’ll have
to find a way to repay you.

52:55.551 --> 52:57.588
Hey, y-you been
to see La Fontaine?

52:57.622 --> 52:58.934
Got a few hard boys
still out there

52:58.968 --> 53:00.418
leaving calling cards.

53:00.453 --> 53:02.213
Ah, the numbers game
at the Green Dragon?

53:02.248 --> 53:04.491
There ain'’t no more numbers game
at the Green Dragon.

53:04.526 --> 53:07.494
Now it'’s a nice warm bonfire.

53:07.529 --> 53:08.875
Couple of Chicago'’s bravest

53:08.909 --> 53:10.670
running around
with squirt pistols.

53:10.704 --> 53:13.742
-Glad you'’re keeping them busy.
-Where'’s Richie?

53:13.776 --> 53:17.021
Oh, I... I thought
he was with you.

53:17.055 --> 53:18.954
-Why would he be with me?
-Well, he...

53:18.988 --> 53:21.059
he-he went out to find you.

53:21.094 --> 53:22.509
Find me? Why?

53:22.544 --> 53:23.614
[chuckles softly]

53:23.648 --> 53:25.547
Hey, you know how Richie is.

53:25.581 --> 53:28.239
You let my son walk out of here
with a marble in his gut?

53:28.274 --> 53:29.758
Let him?

53:29.792 --> 53:31.518
You know, Richie does
what Richie does, right?

53:31.553 --> 53:33.244
That'’s why you're there
to protect him.

53:33.279 --> 53:36.558
Well, he was doing okay.
E-English here patched him up.

53:38.801 --> 53:40.493
Tell the boss what you did.

53:43.081 --> 53:45.360
I did, I did what I could.

53:45.394 --> 53:48.155
And then Richie just
strolled out of here?

53:48.190 --> 53:50.779
Well, you... yeah,
he walked on two feet

53:50.813 --> 53:52.815
and, uh, yeah, he left.

53:52.850 --> 53:55.370
Okay. Grab the tape
and let'’s go find him.

53:55.404 --> 53:56.785
Richie took it with.

53:59.166 --> 54:01.272
I'’m sorry,
I think I misheard you.

54:01.307 --> 54:03.792
Well, he said he was gonna
bring you the tape.

54:03.826 --> 54:05.794
He told me to stay here.

54:05.828 --> 54:08.383
You didn'’t think maybe
you should'’ve gone with him?

54:08.417 --> 54:09.625
It'’s Richie, boss.

54:09.660 --> 54:11.109
He...

54:11.144 --> 54:13.284
Right? The man has
something to prove,

54:13.319 --> 54:16.253
and I figured the best thing
in this situation

54:16.287 --> 54:19.117
was to stay right here
in, uh, in case you turned up.

54:19.152 --> 54:21.292
You figured wrong.

54:21.327 --> 54:23.674
Where exactly did he go?

54:23.708 --> 54:26.884
Well, he didn'’t give me
an itinerary.

54:38.689 --> 54:39.724
Phone?

54:48.802 --> 54:50.977
[phone dialing]

55:03.990 --> 55:06.095
It'’s Roy. Is Richie there?

55:07.269 --> 55:09.685
Well, then go check. Now.

55:16.485 --> 55:18.763
You'’re positive?
He hasn'’t been there all night?

55:21.835 --> 55:24.044
[wood creaks]

55:25.391 --> 55:28.186
Well, check with our
North Side friends. I'’ll wait.

55:32.087 --> 55:33.226
Damn it.

55:36.125 --> 55:38.024
-All right. I'’m at the tailor's.
-[lighter clicking]

55:38.058 --> 55:43.270
I want you to call me back here
every 15 minutes with an update.

55:43.305 --> 55:44.927
You understand?

55:44.962 --> 55:46.343
Every quarter hour.

55:48.621 --> 55:50.795
-[lighter clicks]
-Uh-huh.

55:53.764 --> 55:55.628
Uh-huh.

55:58.216 --> 56:00.357
[wood creaks]

56:07.467 --> 56:08.917
[hangs up receiver]

56:08.951 --> 56:10.608
[footsteps approaching]

56:12.990 --> 56:14.612
Everything good, boss?

56:14.647 --> 56:17.063
Not a single thing is good.

56:17.097 --> 56:19.410
My boy is missing,
the tape is missing,

56:19.445 --> 56:21.447
and there are more blue boys
on those streets

56:21.481 --> 56:24.070
than at
the St. Paddy'’s Day Parade.

56:24.104 --> 56:25.865
[grunts]

56:25.899 --> 56:27.694
-Let'’s go find him,
like you said. -Where?

56:27.729 --> 56:29.696
Everywhere.

56:29.731 --> 56:31.595
Hey, I don'’t like him being
out there any more than you do.

56:31.629 --> 56:34.321
And, uh, English here'’s
done enough.

56:34.356 --> 56:37.808
We should, uh...
we should let him head home.

56:41.950 --> 56:43.020
Yeah, all right.

56:44.331 --> 56:45.678
But just you.

56:46.920 --> 56:48.991
If Richie shows up
at any of our spots,

56:49.026 --> 56:51.615
they'’ll call here,
so I'’m staying here.

56:51.649 --> 56:52.719
[laughs softly]

56:52.754 --> 56:53.962
Boss, if I go alone, um...

56:53.996 --> 56:56.309
You got a problem, Francis?

56:56.343 --> 56:58.276
No. No problem.

56:58.311 --> 57:01.935
You stay here and I'’ll...
I'’ll go find Richie.

57:04.835 --> 57:06.423
Francis.

57:08.770 --> 57:11.013
Bring my boy back to me.

57:17.019 --> 57:20.367
[door opens, bell jingles]

57:20.402 --> 57:21.748
[door closes]

57:21.783 --> 57:24.199
It'’s gonna be a long night.

57:25.511 --> 57:27.858
They usually are, sir.

57:29.791 --> 57:31.482
Some years ago,

57:31.517 --> 57:34.381
a customer comes into my shop
with a suit,

57:34.416 --> 57:36.038
not one of mine.

57:38.040 --> 57:42.148
The customer says,
"The jacket, it'’s too big."

57:42.182 --> 57:43.943
It is.

57:43.977 --> 57:46.532
"The problem," I say,
"is the shoulders."

57:46.566 --> 57:49.983
But the customer says,
no, he likes the shoulders.

57:50.018 --> 57:52.330
The problem is the sleeves.

57:53.677 --> 57:55.644
We go back and forth.

57:55.679 --> 57:57.991
Finally, the customer says,
"It'’s my money,

57:58.026 --> 58:01.063
and I'’m telling you,
cut the sleeves."

58:01.098 --> 58:03.963
So what do I do?

58:03.997 --> 58:08.001
I say, "Yes, sir,"
and then I cut the shoulders.

58:08.036 --> 58:10.901
The customer, he comes back,
tries on his suit.

58:10.935 --> 58:12.523
"It'’s perfect," he says.

58:12.558 --> 58:15.733
"That'’s exactly
what I asked for."

58:25.398 --> 58:28.263
You learn how to do all this
on the Row?

58:29.126 --> 58:30.576
Yes, sir.

58:54.082 --> 58:55.911
You get these on the Row, too?

59:03.781 --> 59:05.300
My apologies.

59:07.095 --> 59:11.617
I trained on these shears.

59:11.651 --> 59:16.104
Every cut I'’ve made,
I made with these shears.

59:17.519 --> 59:21.488
They'’re all I brought with me
when I came to Chicago.

59:23.801 --> 59:25.078
-Please.
-No, no, no, no.

59:25.113 --> 59:27.287
Oh, no, please. Please.

59:30.359 --> 59:32.016
[sighs]

59:39.645 --> 59:42.164
You never told me
why you left England.

59:42.199 --> 59:44.063
It was under attack.

59:44.097 --> 59:45.789
Ah, Nazis?

59:45.823 --> 59:47.342
Worse.

59:47.376 --> 59:49.068
They'’re called blue jeans.

59:49.102 --> 59:51.518
[laughing]

59:55.143 --> 59:56.489
I know what it'’s like

59:56.523 --> 59:59.181
to try to make something
of yourself.

59:59.216 --> 1:00:00.458
Yes.

1:00:00.493 --> 1:00:02.771
Just you and your trusted tools.

1:00:04.014 --> 1:00:05.878
For example...

1:00:08.984 --> 1:00:11.021
[Roy sighs]

1:00:11.055 --> 1:00:13.851
I use this thing here to kill.

1:00:15.301 --> 1:00:17.027
I don'’t even know
how many people.

1:00:17.061 --> 1:00:19.339
All right.

1:00:19.374 --> 1:00:21.479
You got your tools, I got mine.
Here.

1:00:22.688 --> 1:00:24.551
Take a look.

1:00:27.831 --> 1:00:29.867
I read something once

1:00:29.902 --> 1:00:32.663
about how the thing
that separates

1:00:32.698 --> 1:00:34.665
man from monkeys is tools.

1:00:34.700 --> 1:00:36.494
Do you believe all that?

1:00:36.529 --> 1:00:38.220
Evolution?

1:00:39.014 --> 1:00:41.120
I don'’t know.

1:00:41.154 --> 1:00:44.364
But I do know that a man
has a choice in this world

1:00:44.399 --> 1:00:46.159
about how he uses his tools.

1:00:47.229 --> 1:00:49.404
He can destroy or he can build.

1:00:49.438 --> 1:00:50.992
And you think I destroy.

1:00:51.026 --> 1:00:53.960
But, no, with this,
I'’ve built loyalty.

1:00:53.995 --> 1:00:57.239
I have built a crew.
I'’ve built a neighborhood.

1:00:59.448 --> 1:01:01.554
And the men I'’ve had to kill...

1:01:03.590 --> 1:01:06.593
...well, you have to toss away
a few scraps, don'’t you,

1:01:06.628 --> 1:01:08.734
when you'’re cutting
a pair of pants?

1:01:13.842 --> 1:01:15.775
Have you ever heard of
the Outfit?

1:01:17.570 --> 1:01:20.228
Well, I make clothes, so...

1:01:20.262 --> 1:01:22.092
Oh, n-not that kind of outfit.

1:01:22.126 --> 1:01:23.921
It'’s an organization.

1:01:23.956 --> 1:01:26.613
What, like the Rotary Club?

1:01:28.063 --> 1:01:29.720
Maybe you'’ve heard of Al Capone?

1:01:29.755 --> 1:01:30.928
Him I'’ve heard of.

1:01:30.963 --> 1:01:32.447
Yeah. He started it.

1:01:32.481 --> 1:01:34.725
-The Rotary Club?
-The Outfit.

1:01:35.588 --> 1:01:38.073
Al Capone'’s dead, isn't he?

1:01:38.108 --> 1:01:40.179
After he died,

1:01:40.213 --> 1:01:43.769
his organization spread out,
became more of a network.

1:01:45.322 --> 1:01:50.741
Every big-time crew from
Santa Monica to Coney Island,

1:01:50.776 --> 1:01:53.779
Italians in the East,
Jews in the West,

1:01:53.813 --> 1:01:55.608
Poles in St. Louis...

1:01:56.920 --> 1:01:59.992
even a few sons of Killarney
here and there.

1:02:00.958 --> 1:02:03.236
The underworld United Nations.

1:02:03.271 --> 1:02:07.068
Anybody messes with anybody,
the Outfit has your back.

1:02:07.102 --> 1:02:09.070
It'’s like a stamp.

1:02:09.104 --> 1:02:11.589
-"You have arrived."
-And have you arrived?

1:02:11.624 --> 1:02:13.039
Almost.

1:02:13.074 --> 1:02:14.661
They'’ve been
sending us messages,

1:02:14.696 --> 1:02:17.630
saying they like our style.

1:02:17.664 --> 1:02:20.426
They'’re considering us,

1:02:20.460 --> 1:02:21.807
if we can finish
what we started.

1:02:22.808 --> 1:02:24.464
And what have you started?

1:02:24.499 --> 1:02:26.604
Putting every one of
the La Fontaines in the dirt.

1:02:27.605 --> 1:02:29.331
See, the La Fontaines
aren'’t builders.

1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:31.575
That family has been running

1:02:31.609 --> 1:02:33.128
the same numbers racket
for decades.

1:02:34.129 --> 1:02:36.338
Their neighborhood, their rules.

1:02:36.373 --> 1:02:40.170
Nobody ever had the balls
to move in on their operation.

1:02:40.204 --> 1:02:41.792
Until me.

1:02:41.827 --> 1:02:45.106
This tape
everyone'’s looking for,

1:02:45.140 --> 1:02:50.111
Francis said that
some powerful friends

1:02:50.145 --> 1:02:52.147
got you a copy.

1:02:52.182 --> 1:02:53.908
The Outfit, they those friends?

1:02:53.942 --> 1:02:55.668
Yeah, so you understand.

1:02:55.702 --> 1:03:00.190
That tape gets into
the wrong hands,

1:03:00.224 --> 1:03:03.020
then the entire thing
comes crashing down.

1:03:03.055 --> 1:03:05.609
Mr. Boyle, why are you
telling me all this?

1:03:05.643 --> 1:03:07.335
Because that'’s Richie's coat.

1:03:12.512 --> 1:03:13.479
Is it?

1:03:13.513 --> 1:03:15.722
-It is.
-Oh.

1:03:17.828 --> 1:03:21.280
Well, I suppose he must have
left without it.

1:03:21.314 --> 1:03:22.868
In December?

1:03:22.902 --> 1:03:24.662
He was in a bit of a hurry.

1:03:24.697 --> 1:03:27.976
December in Chicago,
and he went out without a coat?

1:03:29.564 --> 1:03:31.738
You'’re hiding something,
my friend.

1:03:33.050 --> 1:03:35.812
And I'’m trying
to help you understand

1:03:35.846 --> 1:03:39.367
that even if I never find out
what it is, the Outfit will.

1:03:39.401 --> 1:03:41.956
So you want
to get clear of this,

1:03:41.990 --> 1:03:44.924
you need to tell me what really
happened in here tonight.

1:03:47.271 --> 1:03:48.755
Now.

1:03:48.790 --> 1:03:52.104
Mr. Boyle,
I'’m telling you the truth.

1:03:57.937 --> 1:03:59.214
Monk!

1:04:02.252 --> 1:04:04.081
Who walks out into the cold,

1:04:04.116 --> 1:04:07.429
in December, in Chicago,
without his coat?

1:04:07.464 --> 1:04:08.706
I ain'’t good at riddles.

1:04:10.225 --> 1:04:12.434
English, where'’s my goddamn son?

1:04:13.573 --> 1:04:16.438
You got five seconds...

1:04:16.473 --> 1:04:18.026
to tell me what happened.

1:04:18.061 --> 1:04:20.511
Five, four...

1:04:20.546 --> 1:04:21.996
[racks loudly]

1:04:22.030 --> 1:04:24.515
-...three... -He made me
promise not to tell.

1:04:24.550 --> 1:04:26.414
Who? Who made you promise?

1:04:26.448 --> 1:04:29.900
He said he'’d kill me
if I told you.

1:04:29.935 --> 1:04:30.936
Who?

1:04:30.970 --> 1:04:32.627
Francis.

1:04:34.905 --> 1:04:39.289
Mr. Boyle,
what really happened to Richie

1:04:39.323 --> 1:04:40.911
is that Francis shot...

1:04:40.946 --> 1:04:42.913
[door opens, bell jingles]

1:04:42.948 --> 1:04:44.535
[door closes]

1:04:44.570 --> 1:04:45.778
Whoa.

1:04:51.749 --> 1:04:52.958
Full house tonight, huh?

1:04:52.992 --> 1:04:54.269
Mable.

1:04:55.615 --> 1:04:58.273
We got some questions
about Richie?

1:04:58.308 --> 1:05:01.069
Realized I know somebody
who might have some answers.

1:05:01.104 --> 1:05:02.968
Francis, English was
just about to tell me

1:05:03.002 --> 1:05:04.935
what really happened to Richie.

1:05:06.109 --> 1:05:08.387
English said you shot somebody.

1:05:08.421 --> 1:05:10.182
Oh, yeah?

1:05:12.011 --> 1:05:13.771
Hey, don'’t look at her,

1:05:13.806 --> 1:05:16.326
don'’t look at him,
you look at me.

1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:17.983
If you tell me the truth,

1:05:18.017 --> 1:05:20.468
there isn'’t a gun in this town
can hurt you.

1:05:20.502 --> 1:05:24.161
You are protected from him,
you'’re protected from him.

1:05:24.196 --> 1:05:25.922
You will be warmed
from the elements.

1:05:27.026 --> 1:05:28.855
But you gotta tell me the truth.

1:05:29.891 --> 1:05:31.789
What did Francis do?

1:05:33.826 --> 1:05:35.103
Francis shot...

1:05:35.138 --> 1:05:36.173
[gun cocks]

1:05:40.522 --> 1:05:41.903
Francis shot...

1:05:43.663 --> 1:05:46.977
...four of La Fontaine'’s men

1:05:47.012 --> 1:05:49.359
earlier this evening.

1:05:50.567 --> 1:05:54.743
But Richie,
he didn'’t shoot a single one.

1:05:55.572 --> 1:05:58.989
He said he was embarrassed.

1:05:59.024 --> 1:06:00.577
Ashamed.

1:06:01.750 --> 1:06:03.511
He said he had to go and...

1:06:05.237 --> 1:06:06.997
go and kill someone.

1:06:07.032 --> 1:06:08.378
Kill who?

1:06:08.412 --> 1:06:09.793
La Fontaine.

1:06:09.827 --> 1:06:14.246
Richie made us promise
not to tell you.

1:06:17.663 --> 1:06:20.528
He knew what he was doing
was dangerous.

1:06:20.562 --> 1:06:24.290
I suppose he didn'’t want you
to stop him.

1:06:24.325 --> 1:06:26.603
You made Richie a promise,
English.

1:06:28.260 --> 1:06:30.158
-We both did.
-Yes, we did.

1:06:30.193 --> 1:06:32.022
I'’m sorry, Mr. Boyle.

1:06:34.197 --> 1:06:35.508
So...

1:06:37.407 --> 1:06:39.892
...where'’s Richie now?

1:06:39.926 --> 1:06:41.825
-You'’re the receptionist?
-Yes.

1:06:41.859 --> 1:06:47.003
After Richie left,
on the way to kill La Fontaine,

1:06:47.037 --> 1:06:48.659
I think he stopped by her place.

1:06:48.694 --> 1:06:50.247
No, he didn'’t.

1:06:50.282 --> 1:06:52.491
Why would he stop by
the receptionist'’s place?

1:06:52.525 --> 1:06:55.494
-Because she'’s Richie's girl.
-I'’m not Richie's girl.

1:06:55.528 --> 1:06:56.909
-The hell you'’re not.
-I'’m not. -You're not?

1:06:56.943 --> 1:06:59.049
-I'’m not.
-Yeah, she is.

1:06:59.877 --> 1:07:01.603
Richie likes to brag.

1:07:02.742 --> 1:07:06.712
Mr. Boyle,
all I know about tonight

1:07:06.746 --> 1:07:08.196
is that, at00 in the morning,

1:07:08.231 --> 1:07:10.267
this ham-handed jerk
knocks on my door,

1:07:10.302 --> 1:07:13.029
tells me I gotta come with him,
and when I demur, he s...

1:07:13.063 --> 1:07:15.100
When I come into her place,

1:07:15.134 --> 1:07:16.791
there'’s a bloodstain
on the carpet.

1:07:16.825 --> 1:07:17.826
What?

1:07:19.104 --> 1:07:21.209
That'’s not true. That's a lie.
[gasps, screams]

1:07:21.244 --> 1:07:22.279
Stop! Stop!

1:07:25.558 --> 1:07:27.629
-Come.
-[Mable sniffles]

1:07:30.632 --> 1:07:32.807
You live close?

1:07:34.671 --> 1:07:36.397
Down the street.

1:07:36.431 --> 1:07:38.261
Lived on this block
my whole life.

1:07:38.295 --> 1:07:40.504
-What'’s your name?
-Mable.

1:07:41.505 --> 1:07:42.851
Sean.

1:07:44.129 --> 1:07:45.130
Shit.

1:07:45.164 --> 1:07:47.270
Your dad was Ryan Sean.

1:07:47.304 --> 1:07:49.927
That'’s what they tell me.

1:07:49.962 --> 1:07:52.206
Did some work for me
once upon a time.

1:07:52.240 --> 1:07:54.725
He'’s a real tough guy, your dad.

1:07:54.760 --> 1:07:57.832
Was he? I wouldn'’t know.
He wasn'’t really around much.

1:07:57.866 --> 1:07:59.178
I was sorry about...

1:08:00.283 --> 1:08:02.492
well, what happened to him.

1:08:02.526 --> 1:08:04.218
Thank you.

1:08:04.252 --> 1:08:06.116
Neighborhood'’s funny that way.

1:08:06.151 --> 1:08:10.327
Bad thing happens to a guy,
everyone is so sorry, but...

1:08:11.949 --> 1:08:13.606
...nobody saw a thing.

1:08:15.367 --> 1:08:17.162
It was a long time ago.

1:08:18.059 --> 1:08:20.096
And this business, well...

1:08:20.958 --> 1:08:22.719
sometimes bad things happen.

1:08:25.894 --> 1:08:28.276
Mable Sean, where'’s my son?

1:08:28.311 --> 1:08:32.729
Like I said,
I don'’t have the foggiest.

1:08:34.386 --> 1:08:36.905
Monk, get the coat.

1:08:41.013 --> 1:08:42.601
Mr. Boyle, may I?

1:08:42.635 --> 1:08:44.499
-- You recognize this coat?
-- Yeah.

1:08:44.534 --> 1:08:45.880
That'’s Richie's coat.

1:08:45.914 --> 1:08:47.675
And if Richie was to take off

1:08:47.709 --> 1:08:50.195
in the middle of December,
with a marble in his belly,

1:08:50.229 --> 1:08:52.611
then Richie, who,
let'’s all be honest,

1:08:52.645 --> 1:08:54.302
is not known for his planning,

1:08:54.337 --> 1:08:57.650
was probably intending
on stopping somewhere close.

1:08:57.685 --> 1:09:01.620
Maybe he was just going
down the street to her place.

1:09:01.654 --> 1:09:04.001
And you said
you ain'’t good at riddles.

1:09:05.244 --> 1:09:07.384
When was the last time
you saw my son?

1:09:07.419 --> 1:09:09.179
Here. Earlier today.

1:09:09.214 --> 1:09:11.871
Boss, some bastard
has been ratting on us,

1:09:11.906 --> 1:09:13.459
-right?
-Right.

1:09:13.494 --> 1:09:15.358
What if that
rat bastard is a girl?

1:09:16.497 --> 1:09:18.188
She could have overheard
information from Richie.

1:09:18.223 --> 1:09:20.156
Pillow talk and the like.

1:09:20.190 --> 1:09:21.881
If he shows up at her place

1:09:21.916 --> 1:09:25.022
carrying the very thing
that puts the finger on her,

1:09:25.057 --> 1:09:26.576
I'’m, I'm just saying.

1:09:26.610 --> 1:09:28.474
We don'’t know
who she'’s been ratting to

1:09:28.509 --> 1:09:31.339
or, uh, if he might have been
there when Richie showed up.

1:09:31.374 --> 1:09:33.099
But you don'’t have to be
Joe Friday

1:09:33.134 --> 1:09:34.411
to put it all together.

1:09:34.446 --> 1:09:36.102
Mr. Boyle.

1:09:36.931 --> 1:09:38.657
I'’ve known Mable...

1:09:38.691 --> 1:09:40.728
I'’ve known Mable for years.

1:09:40.762 --> 1:09:43.903
I'’m willing to bet my life
she has nothing to do with this.

1:09:43.938 --> 1:09:45.767
Oh, I'’ll take that bet.

1:09:52.912 --> 1:09:54.259
Let'’s get the lady talking.

1:09:54.293 --> 1:09:55.329
Fuck.

1:09:55.363 --> 1:09:56.433
-[gasps]
-No, no.

1:09:56.468 --> 1:09:58.055
What is wrong with...?

1:09:58.090 --> 1:10:00.230
-[cries out] -No!
-Where'’s Richie?

1:10:00.265 --> 1:10:01.852
I don'’t know.

1:10:01.887 --> 1:10:03.578
[gasps]

1:10:03.613 --> 1:10:05.235
Richie was right about you.
You'’re not a man at all.

1:10:05.270 --> 1:10:06.892
So you and Richie
did do a little talking.

1:10:06.926 --> 1:10:09.032
-[gasping] -[racks gun]
-Back up, English.

1:10:09.066 --> 1:10:10.447
-This ain'’t your purview.
-[Mable coughing]

1:10:10.482 --> 1:10:12.277
Yeah, all right,
all right, all right.

1:10:12.311 --> 1:10:14.589
[coughing, gasping]

1:10:14.624 --> 1:10:17.696
Francis, take her
to the back room.

1:10:17.730 --> 1:10:19.974
-Go.
-[Mable whimpers]

1:10:20.008 --> 1:10:21.665
Mr. Boyle, please.

1:10:22.839 --> 1:10:24.116
-I'’m sorry.
-Move.

1:10:24.150 --> 1:10:26.360
-I am.
-Sit her down.

1:10:26.394 --> 1:10:28.431
We'’ll clean up after.

1:10:30.605 --> 1:10:32.055
I-I'’m telling you the truth.

1:10:32.089 --> 1:10:34.264
All right, the last time
that I saw Richie,

1:10:34.299 --> 1:10:36.232
I was...
I-I was inside this shop.

1:10:36.266 --> 1:10:37.957
I was closing up for the night.

1:10:37.992 --> 1:10:40.408
-[Mable continues indistinctly]
-[flames crackling]

1:10:43.342 --> 1:10:44.964
[snips loudly]

1:10:45.965 --> 1:10:47.829
[flames whooshing and crackling]

1:10:52.317 --> 1:10:54.146
Hey!

1:10:54.180 --> 1:10:55.423
Where you think you'’re going?

1:10:55.458 --> 1:10:57.149
Uh, uh...

1:10:57.183 --> 1:10:59.393
Nobody'’s going anywhere
until we find my boy.

1:10:59.427 --> 1:11:01.947
Mr. Boyle, sir, I-I...

1:11:01.981 --> 1:11:04.605
I... I can'’t. I'm sorry.

1:11:04.639 --> 1:11:06.917
-I'’ll send you away right now.
-Oh, settle.

1:11:06.952 --> 1:11:09.472
I know you have to do
wh-what you have to do

1:11:09.506 --> 1:11:10.921
to find your son.

1:11:10.956 --> 1:11:12.302
I understand how you feel.

1:11:12.337 --> 1:11:14.856
You understand how I feel?

1:11:16.375 --> 1:11:18.204
I had a daughter.

1:11:22.899 --> 1:11:26.696
I didn'’t, I didn't come
to Chicago

1:11:26.730 --> 1:11:28.284
because of...

1:11:29.388 --> 1:11:31.459
uh, blue jeans.

1:11:35.083 --> 1:11:38.708
There was a fire in my shop.

1:11:38.742 --> 1:11:43.299
I-I didn'’t, I didn't even
notice it at first,

1:11:43.333 --> 1:11:45.370
I was so busy working.

1:11:45.404 --> 1:11:46.992
The fabrics lit up.

1:11:47.026 --> 1:11:48.545
Everything...

1:11:49.581 --> 1:11:52.894
burned so fast.

1:11:55.863 --> 1:11:59.832
My wife and my little girl,
they lived upstairs.

1:12:02.110 --> 1:12:03.698
I heard them.

1:12:09.946 --> 1:12:13.950
The shears,
they was a gift from my wife.

1:12:16.262 --> 1:12:18.230
So, you understand.

1:12:18.264 --> 1:12:20.266
Boss, you don'’t have
to listen to...

1:12:20.301 --> 1:12:21.509
Quiet.

1:12:24.616 --> 1:12:26.203
Mr. Boyle...

1:12:27.412 --> 1:12:31.899
...you can hurt young Mable,
you can hurt me,

1:12:31.933 --> 1:12:37.525
you can kill any one of us
with a snap of your fingers...

1:12:39.700 --> 1:12:41.633
...but it won'’t find
your child...

1:12:43.635 --> 1:12:45.533
...no matter how much
you want it...

1:12:45.568 --> 1:12:48.122
[phone ringing]

1:12:52.885 --> 1:12:54.128
Go get it.

1:12:54.162 --> 1:12:56.717
[ringing continues]

1:13:00.099 --> 1:13:01.549
Hello?

1:13:02.792 --> 1:13:04.759
Oh.

1:13:04.794 --> 1:13:06.312
Really?

1:13:06.347 --> 1:13:08.487
We'’ve all been
tremendously worried.

1:13:10.144 --> 1:13:11.559
20 minutes?

1:13:11.594 --> 1:13:13.319
Fantastic.

1:13:13.354 --> 1:13:16.046
Yes, yes, of course, I will.

1:13:16.081 --> 1:13:17.565
All right.

1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:18.635
Thank you.

1:13:18.670 --> 1:13:20.257
[hangs up receiver]

1:13:20.292 --> 1:13:23.053
[footsteps approaching]

1:13:23.088 --> 1:13:24.123
What was that?

1:13:24.952 --> 1:13:26.160
That was Richie.

1:13:27.472 --> 1:13:30.578
He said he'’s in hiding
from the La Fontaines,

1:13:30.613 --> 1:13:31.959
but he has the tape

1:13:31.993 --> 1:13:33.339
and he wants you to go
pick him up.

1:13:33.374 --> 1:13:36.722
31st and Halsted.

1:13:36.757 --> 1:13:37.999
20 minutes.

1:13:39.173 --> 1:13:42.452
Before I-I could get
any more details...

1:13:42.487 --> 1:13:44.799
[chuckles] he was gone.

1:13:56.155 --> 1:13:57.605
Let'’s go.

1:13:58.641 --> 1:14:00.194
We'’ll swing by the house

1:14:00.228 --> 1:14:02.334
and pick up whoever'’s there
to come with us.

1:14:02.368 --> 1:14:04.370
Hey, may-maybe we should
just take a minute.

1:14:04.405 --> 1:14:05.958
My son is waiting.

1:14:07.201 --> 1:14:10.204
For what are we gonna take
a goddamn minute?

1:14:12.171 --> 1:14:13.897
Let'’s get to it.

1:14:27.532 --> 1:14:28.533
Boss?

1:14:31.432 --> 1:14:34.642
Maybe I should wait back.
Keep an eye on them, huh?

1:14:34.677 --> 1:14:36.713
I need all the firepower I got.

1:14:36.748 --> 1:14:39.682
You really want to
trust Richie'’s life to the hope

1:14:39.716 --> 1:14:43.030
that tonight doesn'’t have
any more twists in store?

1:14:43.064 --> 1:14:45.653
If the devil himself
came crashing through the roof,

1:14:45.688 --> 1:14:47.552
I wouldn'’t be shocked right now.

1:14:50.347 --> 1:14:51.383
All right.

1:14:52.867 --> 1:14:54.524
All right.
Belts and suspenders.

1:14:54.559 --> 1:14:55.732
[Mable sighs]

1:14:55.767 --> 1:14:57.803
Make sure they don'’t go nowhere.

1:14:57.838 --> 1:14:59.322
[door opens, bell jingles]

1:14:59.356 --> 1:15:01.531
[wind howling]

1:15:03.740 --> 1:15:05.017
[sniffs]

1:15:11.092 --> 1:15:13.405
[vehicle doors open, close]

1:15:13.439 --> 1:15:15.269
-[engine starts]
-[Mable sniffles]

1:15:15.303 --> 1:15:17.098
[vehicle driving away]

1:15:17.133 --> 1:15:19.376
[panting softly]

1:15:41.122 --> 1:15:43.193
You want to tell me
who the fuck you just talked to

1:15:43.228 --> 1:15:44.436
on that phone?

1:15:44.470 --> 1:15:46.093
That was one of Mr. Boyle'’s men

1:15:46.127 --> 1:15:49.614
calling to say
he'’d yet to hear from Richie.

1:15:51.754 --> 1:15:53.894
Hmm.

1:15:53.928 --> 1:15:55.620
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:15:55.654 --> 1:15:56.931
Either I kill her now

1:15:56.966 --> 1:15:58.795
and we pin tonight
on her corpse...

1:15:58.830 --> 1:16:02.385
...or I kill both of you
and do it all myself.

1:16:02.419 --> 1:16:03.904
It'’s, it's your choice.

1:16:03.938 --> 1:16:05.733
You need her assistance.

1:16:05.768 --> 1:16:07.701
With what do I need
her assistance?

1:16:07.735 --> 1:16:10.876
Roy Boyle is about to walk
directly into an ambush.

1:16:10.911 --> 1:16:13.120
-Who'’s ambushing him?
-The La Fontaines.

1:16:13.154 --> 1:16:14.777
And how exactly
are the La Fontaines

1:16:14.811 --> 1:16:16.399
gonna know where to ambush him?

1:16:16.433 --> 1:16:17.952
Because Mable'’s
about to tell them.

1:16:17.987 --> 1:16:19.402
-Me?
-Yes, you.

1:16:19.436 --> 1:16:22.094
-Why me?
-Because you'’re the rat.

1:16:27.479 --> 1:16:29.792
You'’ve been sleeping
with Richie Boyle.

1:16:29.826 --> 1:16:31.621
You kept hearing him talk about

1:16:31.656 --> 1:16:34.935
his father'’s escalating war
with the La Fontaines

1:16:34.969 --> 1:16:37.178
and you saw your chance.

1:16:39.664 --> 1:16:41.907
You sold information
to La Fontaine

1:16:41.942 --> 1:16:46.602
so that you could finally
get out of Chicago.

1:16:51.952 --> 1:16:55.438
But Francis...
Francis is paranoid.

1:16:55.472 --> 1:16:59.373
Sooner or later, you thought
he would have found you out.

1:17:00.581 --> 1:17:03.722
So you helped the FBI
to plant a bug.

1:17:05.310 --> 1:17:09.038
If the FBI could take down
the Boyle crew,

1:17:09.072 --> 1:17:10.315
you could get away clean.

1:17:11.834 --> 1:17:13.905
But you didn'’t plan
for one thing:

1:17:17.080 --> 1:17:18.495
The Outfit.

1:17:20.877 --> 1:17:23.397
They told the Boyles
about the bug.

1:17:23.431 --> 1:17:24.709
Richie told you.

1:17:25.537 --> 1:17:27.366
What could you do?

1:17:29.541 --> 1:17:31.716
You told La Fontaine.

1:17:35.996 --> 1:17:39.068
And hoped that they would
all kill each other...

1:17:40.069 --> 1:17:41.933
...before they found you.

1:17:52.909 --> 1:17:55.843
You got your hustle.
I got mine.

1:17:57.293 --> 1:17:58.984
You were, you were
the fucking rat?

1:17:59.019 --> 1:18:00.676
I'’ve spent my entire life

1:18:00.710 --> 1:18:03.230
watching you leeches
suck this neighborhood dry.

1:18:03.264 --> 1:18:05.094
I am gonna love...

1:18:06.095 --> 1:18:09.063
sitting in a café in Paris,

1:18:09.098 --> 1:18:11.859
reading all about your funeral.

1:18:12.757 --> 1:18:13.861
You stole the tape?

1:18:13.896 --> 1:18:16.139
No. That was me.

1:18:34.571 --> 1:18:36.021
You knew what I was doing,

1:18:36.056 --> 1:18:37.402
and instead of stopping me,
you helped.

1:18:37.436 --> 1:18:38.955
-Yes.
-Fuck you.

1:18:38.990 --> 1:18:40.474
I can take care of myself.

1:18:42.062 --> 1:18:45.686
If she doesn'’t call
the La Fontaines in the next...

1:18:47.792 --> 1:18:49.483
...two minutes, I'’d say,

1:18:49.517 --> 1:18:54.143
Roy Boyle will return,
having failed to find his son.

1:18:55.178 --> 1:18:57.456
Eventually,
he'’ll discover Richie,

1:18:58.492 --> 1:19:00.943
and then he'’ll kill all of us.

1:19:00.977 --> 1:19:04.878
Or Mable can tell
the La Fontaines

1:19:04.912 --> 1:19:09.123
where to ambush him
and offer to sell them the tape.

1:19:10.435 --> 1:19:12.264
Now tell me,

1:19:12.299 --> 1:19:17.338
if Roy Boyle and all his
senior lieutenants die tonight,

1:19:17.373 --> 1:19:21.135
who will be in charge
of his organization?

1:19:23.551 --> 1:19:25.761
I took six bullets for that man.

1:19:25.795 --> 1:19:28.039
And how many has he taken
for you?

1:19:29.040 --> 1:19:31.283
He made me everything
that I am today.

1:19:31.318 --> 1:19:36.288
And today is the day
that you don'’t need him anymore.

1:19:37.807 --> 1:19:40.948
You think I'’m just gonna
betray Roy Boyle that easy?

1:19:41.742 --> 1:19:44.158
No, I don'’t think it's easy.

1:19:44.193 --> 1:19:47.403
I think option A is: we all die.

1:19:48.300 --> 1:19:50.233
And option B is:

1:19:51.648 --> 1:19:54.168
you run the Boyle organization.

1:20:14.257 --> 1:20:16.225
Make the goddamn call.

1:20:23.266 --> 1:20:25.406
I'’m not here.

1:20:32.586 --> 1:20:34.795
[phone dialing]

1:20:42.354 --> 1:20:44.840
Bonsoir.[clears throat]

1:20:44.874 --> 1:20:49.258
[Mable speaking French]
...Stetson.

1:20:49.292 --> 1:20:50.707
Stetson.

1:20:50.742 --> 1:20:52.744
Yes, um... [clears throat]

1:20:53.952 --> 1:20:56.058
[continues speaking French]

1:20:56.092 --> 1:20:57.438
...Roy Boyle...

1:20:57.473 --> 1:20:59.785
[continues speaking French]

...Halsted.

1:21:06.723 --> 1:21:09.036
[continues speaking French]

1:21:11.383 --> 1:21:13.178
...La Fontaine...

1:21:13.213 --> 1:21:15.905
[continues speaking French]

1:21:15.940 --> 1:21:17.217
[hangs up receiver]

1:21:19.944 --> 1:21:21.877
La Fontaine wants
to make a deal.

1:21:21.911 --> 1:21:23.809
Tape for cash. One hour.

1:21:23.844 --> 1:21:25.950
I didn'’t know you spoke French.

1:21:25.984 --> 1:21:27.883
Francis,

1:21:27.917 --> 1:21:30.333
the number of things about me
that you don'’t know...

1:21:33.854 --> 1:21:35.752
So what the fuck
really happened to Richie?

1:21:39.929 --> 1:21:41.275
[gasps]

1:21:50.008 --> 1:21:52.252
[lid creaks shut]

1:22:05.817 --> 1:22:08.785
[vehicle approaching]

1:22:11.685 --> 1:22:13.100
That'’s La Fontaine.

1:22:13.135 --> 1:22:14.860
I'’m gonna hide in the back.

1:22:14.895 --> 1:22:16.862
As soon as you peep the green,
you toss me a signal.

1:22:16.897 --> 1:22:18.657
"Count'’s right." And then...

1:22:18.692 --> 1:22:19.796
[imitates gunshot]

1:22:19.831 --> 1:22:21.419
This is a stupid fucking idea.

1:22:21.453 --> 1:22:23.007
You don'’t toss me a signal,

1:22:23.041 --> 1:22:25.078
I'’m gonna come out firing
indiscriminate-like.

1:22:25.112 --> 1:22:28.702
When La Fontaine dies tonight,
I'’m not only leading our crew,

1:22:28.736 --> 1:22:30.669
I'’m leading them
into the Outfit.

1:22:31.670 --> 1:22:33.638
It'’s the least I could do.
For Roy.

1:22:33.672 --> 1:22:37.021
[doorbell ringing]

1:22:39.851 --> 1:22:41.853
[door sliding closed]

1:22:48.929 --> 1:22:50.517
[whispering]:
He'’s gonna kill us, too.

1:22:57.179 --> 1:22:58.525
[bell jingles]

1:22:58.559 --> 1:23:00.216
Bonsoir.

1:23:00.251 --> 1:23:01.390
You'’re open late.

1:23:01.424 --> 1:23:04.358
Mm. We work by appointment.

1:23:04.393 --> 1:23:06.395
This is Mr. Burling.

1:23:08.224 --> 1:23:11.365
I didn'’t know this city
had any tailors so classy.

1:23:12.401 --> 1:23:13.885
-Thank you.
-[door closes]

1:23:13.919 --> 1:23:16.474
You know how to make clothes
for a lady?

1:23:16.508 --> 1:23:18.269
I haven'’t a clue.

1:23:19.235 --> 1:23:20.271
Désolé.

1:23:21.237 --> 1:23:22.928
I might have an inkling.

1:23:28.348 --> 1:23:30.074
Oh.

1:23:30.108 --> 1:23:32.041
[chuckling]

1:23:38.979 --> 1:23:42.362
I'’m guessing it's been
quite an evening for you folks.

1:23:43.363 --> 1:23:45.365
Hazard of the trade, madame.

1:23:49.990 --> 1:23:51.750
Which one of you has my tape?

1:23:51.785 --> 1:23:53.373
Money first.

1:24:03.728 --> 1:24:04.763
Please.

1:24:17.017 --> 1:24:18.191
[La Fontaine clicking tongue]

1:24:18.225 --> 1:24:20.124
[La Fontaine chuckles]

1:24:31.100 --> 1:24:32.101
Looks like...

1:24:32.136 --> 1:24:34.655
Madame La Fontaine,

1:24:34.690 --> 1:24:36.174
are you trying to rob us?

1:24:37.175 --> 1:24:38.314
Where'’s the money?

1:24:46.184 --> 1:24:49.774
We'’re not showing you the tape
until we see the money.

1:24:49.808 --> 1:24:51.569
Tape first.

1:24:51.603 --> 1:24:54.296
How do I know what'’s on it?
I'’ve gotta listen.

1:24:54.330 --> 1:24:55.642
Well, it seems like

1:24:55.676 --> 1:24:57.092
you'’re just gonna
have to trust us.

1:24:57.126 --> 1:24:58.438
Ou, peut-être,

1:24:58.472 --> 1:25:00.612
we may be have
to trust each other.

1:25:02.304 --> 1:25:03.512
[floorboard creaks]

1:25:12.624 --> 1:25:13.832
Okay.

1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:16.628
Let'’s make a deal.

1:25:17.905 --> 1:25:21.668
You give me the green,
I'’ll walk away.

1:25:21.702 --> 1:25:24.671
We all live to kill each other
some other time.

1:25:24.705 --> 1:25:26.535
You know what makes me mad?

1:25:28.192 --> 1:25:32.334
I'’ve been running numbers
in this city my whole life.

1:25:33.231 --> 1:25:35.613
But nobody said a thing.

1:25:35.647 --> 1:25:39.996
Cops, racket boys,
nobody even noticed.

1:25:41.101 --> 1:25:45.140
Until the second
we started making real money.

1:25:45.174 --> 1:25:48.488
Mon Dieu, this fucking city.

1:25:50.904 --> 1:25:55.219
Since day one, people like me,
people like our English friend,

1:25:55.253 --> 1:25:59.395
we come here and we make
something of ourselves.

1:25:59.430 --> 1:26:01.328
And then right as soon
as we get big enough,

1:26:01.363 --> 1:26:03.330
you connardsshow up

1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:07.403
with your hair slicked back,

1:26:07.438 --> 1:26:10.061
shoes all shiny,

1:26:10.095 --> 1:26:12.236
and you snatch it away.

1:26:13.927 --> 1:26:17.102
Like a spoiled child
who'’d rather break his own toys

1:26:17.137 --> 1:26:19.277
than watch somebody else
play with them.

1:26:25.076 --> 1:26:28.942
So I will admit to a...

1:26:29.598 --> 1:26:32.048
satisfaction earlier

1:26:33.464 --> 1:26:35.707
at 31st and Halsted

1:26:37.261 --> 1:26:40.125
when I put a gun
to Roy Boyle'’s head

1:26:41.161 --> 1:26:44.129
and watched him die
as he'’d lived.

1:26:46.753 --> 1:26:49.790
Sorry he ever met me.

1:26:50.446 --> 1:26:52.517
Madame,

1:26:52.552 --> 1:26:55.106
you have nothing to fear
from this man.

1:26:55.140 --> 1:26:57.281
Why is that?

1:26:57.315 --> 1:26:59.800
Because earlier this evening,

1:27:00.836 --> 1:27:03.942
I removed all the bullets
from his gun.

1:27:10.397 --> 1:27:12.296
[Francis groans quietly]

1:27:18.129 --> 1:27:20.614
Any other killers in here
I should know about?

1:27:28.312 --> 1:27:29.830
Only you.

1:27:36.975 --> 1:27:38.598
A tailor.

1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:42.809
Always listening, never talking.

1:27:44.189 --> 1:27:49.367
But nobody stop to think:
"What'’s going on in his head?"

1:28:03.036 --> 1:28:06.315
I'’m not a tailor, ma'am.

1:28:06.350 --> 1:28:07.972
I'’m a cutter.

1:28:12.459 --> 1:28:14.565
Un coupeur.

1:28:19.224 --> 1:28:20.536
Au revoir.

1:28:28.372 --> 1:28:29.890
[exhales slowly]

1:28:36.725 --> 1:28:38.036
Mm.

1:28:41.350 --> 1:28:42.593
They'’ll find us out.

1:28:43.697 --> 1:28:46.044
The Boyles are all dead.

1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:48.530
The Outfit, then.

1:28:48.564 --> 1:28:51.395
Why would the Outfit
come looking for us?

1:28:51.429 --> 1:28:54.674
Because we took the tape
that everyone is loo...

1:29:23.219 --> 1:29:25.774
To the naked eye,

1:29:25.808 --> 1:29:29.191
a suit appears
to consist of two parts...

1:29:29.225 --> 1:29:30.710
The tape.

1:29:30.744 --> 1:29:33.851
...a jacket and trousers.

1:29:33.885 --> 1:29:35.542
It'’s just a fake.

1:29:35.577 --> 1:29:38.959
But these two
seemingly solid parts

1:29:38.994 --> 1:29:42.618
are composed of
four different fabrics.

1:29:42.653 --> 1:29:45.069
The Outfit has never even
heard of Roy Boyle.

1:29:48.486 --> 1:29:51.869
They didn'’t send those messages.

1:29:51.903 --> 1:29:53.457
You did.

1:29:55.113 --> 1:29:57.426
You'’ve been planning this
for months.

1:29:59.255 --> 1:30:01.326
Everything that happened.

1:30:02.949 --> 1:30:04.468
You set it all up.

1:30:08.092 --> 1:30:13.097
This contains everything
that went on here this evening.

1:30:13.131 --> 1:30:15.720
Enough to convict
any remaining Boyles

1:30:15.755 --> 1:30:17.446
of a dozen crimes

1:30:17.481 --> 1:30:20.449
and Madame La Fontaine
of the murder of Roy Boyle.

1:30:20.484 --> 1:30:22.658
You won'’t mind, will you,
popping it in the post

1:30:22.693 --> 1:30:24.626
to your friend at the FBI?

1:30:24.660 --> 1:30:26.317
On your way to...

1:30:26.351 --> 1:30:28.284
[chuckles softly]

1:30:28.319 --> 1:30:29.872
Perhaps it'’s safest if...

1:30:31.322 --> 1:30:33.462
...I don'’t know.

1:30:33.497 --> 1:30:36.431
But make it somewhere grand.

1:30:50.824 --> 1:30:52.792
So what about you?

1:30:52.826 --> 1:30:55.311
Oh, I'’ve started over before.

1:30:55.346 --> 1:30:57.313
It'’ll be easier the second time.

1:30:59.971 --> 1:31:01.421
-Come with me.
-No.

1:31:02.698 --> 1:31:04.942
No, come with me.

1:31:04.976 --> 1:31:07.392
You can show me things
you'’ve already seen.

1:31:07.427 --> 1:31:10.775
You will not spend
your best years

1:31:10.810 --> 1:31:13.709
taking care of my remaining few.

1:31:20.198 --> 1:31:22.373
I was taking care of
myself just fine, you know.

1:31:22.407 --> 1:31:24.479
Oh, yes.

1:31:24.513 --> 1:31:27.516
Knowing you, I'’m quite confident
you'’d have seen to the burials

1:31:27.551 --> 1:31:30.519
of each and every one
of those murderers.

1:31:30.554 --> 1:31:31.831
But then...

1:31:33.004 --> 1:31:36.214
you'’d no longer be pretending
to be one,

1:31:36.939 --> 1:31:38.493
would you?

1:31:58.374 --> 1:31:59.928
I wish I could have met her.

1:32:02.620 --> 1:32:04.449
Your real...

1:32:05.140 --> 1:32:06.417
you know.

1:32:10.973 --> 1:32:12.527
[chuckles softly]

1:32:12.561 --> 1:32:14.529
She would have liked you.

1:32:29.716 --> 1:32:30.959
[Mable sniffles]

1:32:38.311 --> 1:32:40.175
[bell jingles]

1:32:42.246 --> 1:32:43.523
[door closes]

1:32:59.194 --> 1:33:01.748
Finishings, for me,
can be the hardest part.

1:33:05.925 --> 1:33:08.341
Not because there'’s
any great skill involved

1:33:08.375 --> 1:33:11.482
in these final steps...

1:33:14.658 --> 1:33:17.488
...putting on a few buttons,
closing up a few edges,

1:33:17.522 --> 1:33:20.180
but because
if you'’ve done your job,

1:33:21.665 --> 1:33:25.323
all the true craftsmanship
has already occurred.

1:33:26.670 --> 1:33:29.811
The finishings are
mere inevitabilities.

1:33:43.514 --> 1:33:45.378
It'’s at the finishings

1:33:45.412 --> 1:33:48.830
that you must come to terms
with the idea

1:33:48.864 --> 1:33:53.041
that perfection
is a necessary goal...

1:33:55.491 --> 1:33:59.703
...precisely because
it is unattainable.

1:34:06.192 --> 1:34:10.196
If you don'’t aim for perfection,
you cannot make anything great.

1:34:10.230 --> 1:34:14.165
And yet, true perfection
is impossible.

1:34:26.281 --> 1:34:28.386
[flames whooshing]

1:34:57.415 --> 1:34:58.382
[cries out]

1:34:58.416 --> 1:35:00.556
[groaning]

-[gun clicking]
-[gasps]

1:35:13.984 --> 1:35:15.468
Oh.

1:35:23.096 --> 1:35:24.477
Oh, no.

1:35:30.794 --> 1:35:32.105
[grunting]

1:35:34.521 --> 1:35:35.764
[groaning]

1:35:35.799 --> 1:35:37.766
Stop.

1:35:37.801 --> 1:35:40.735
[panting]

1:35:47.983 --> 1:35:50.261
[clatters]

1:35:53.368 --> 1:35:55.473
So at the finish,

1:35:55.508 --> 1:35:57.717
you must reconcile yourself...

1:35:58.822 --> 1:36:00.030
...to failure.

1:36:05.276 --> 1:36:07.589
I was like you once.

1:36:07.623 --> 1:36:09.246
-[grunts]
-I was.

1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:11.144
[chuckles quietly]

1:36:11.179 --> 1:36:13.802
Made my living with a gun.

1:36:14.665 --> 1:36:16.736
A knife.

1:36:19.014 --> 1:36:20.705
Sometimes...

1:36:22.535 --> 1:36:24.295
...just my bare hands.

1:36:29.128 --> 1:36:30.301
I'’d...

1:36:33.684 --> 1:36:36.791
I'’d a gift, they said.

1:36:39.655 --> 1:36:41.830
But it wasn'’t magic.

1:36:42.658 --> 1:36:44.729
It was work.

1:37:00.055 --> 1:37:04.197
One day, they asked me to do
something I couldn'’t do.

1:37:05.889 --> 1:37:07.476
So I ran. I hid.

1:37:07.511 --> 1:37:09.651
I hid on the Row.

1:37:09.685 --> 1:37:13.275
Picked up a trade,
learnt a craft, and met my wife.

1:37:16.934 --> 1:37:18.522
Vera.

1:37:19.695 --> 1:37:21.490
I fell in love.

1:37:21.525 --> 1:37:24.804
We had little Lily.
I fell in love again.

1:37:27.911 --> 1:37:29.844
But they found me.

1:37:32.605 --> 1:37:34.227
They found me.

1:37:35.435 --> 1:37:38.576
Set fire to my shop.

1:37:40.578 --> 1:37:42.408
My home.

1:37:45.273 --> 1:37:46.412
My life.

1:37:47.827 --> 1:37:51.624
I came here to get away
from all that violence.

1:37:52.728 --> 1:37:54.903
Get away from myself.

1:37:54.938 --> 1:37:56.422
[chuckles]

1:37:56.456 --> 1:37:59.943
M-My first day here,
who did I meet?

1:38:01.151 --> 1:38:02.221
Huh.

1:38:04.809 --> 1:38:07.398
I suppose I put, put on
these clothes

1:38:07.433 --> 1:38:12.576
to convince myself
I'’m civilized.

1:38:14.958 --> 1:38:17.926
I want so bad to be good.

1:38:20.101 --> 1:38:21.688
[chuckles]

1:38:22.689 --> 1:38:23.898
[grunting]

1:38:23.932 --> 1:38:25.830
[gasping]

1:38:31.112 --> 1:38:33.321
[gasps]

1:38:34.667 --> 1:38:36.876
[Francis gurgling]

1:38:45.505 --> 1:38:47.714
[gasping]

1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:07.493
[panting softly]

1:39:07.527 --> 1:39:09.805
[flames crackling]

1:39:17.641 --> 1:39:19.643
[whooshing, crackling]

1:39:27.927 --> 1:39:29.998
It'’s not perfect.

1:39:30.033 --> 1:39:32.173
You have to make your peace
with that.

1:39:33.139 --> 1:39:34.175
[bell jingles]

1:39:37.350 --> 1:39:39.042
How?

1:39:43.046 --> 1:39:45.151
Well...

1:39:45.186 --> 1:39:47.326
you sit at your board,

1:39:47.360 --> 1:39:49.880
you lay out your tools...

1:39:51.088 --> 1:39:53.711
...and you start again.

1:45:12.409 --> 1:45:14.653
[music fades]
