WEBVTT

00:47.917 --> 00:49.179
- Surprise, babe.

00:49.223 --> 00:50.746
- Yeah, wow.

00:50.789 --> 00:53.357
This is not a banana.

00:53.401 --> 00:56.186
- I know Valentine's Day
isn't for a couple of days,

00:56.230 --> 00:57.796
but I thought why not?

00:57.840 --> 00:59.102
Let me surprise my hubby

00:59.146 --> 01:02.192
before some crazy
meta-of-the-week strikes.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.672
- Here, wait, I got it.

01:03.715 --> 01:04.716
How's your arm?

01:04.760 --> 01:05.978
- Oh, um,

01:06.022 --> 01:07.893
I mean, it stings,
but it's a bit better.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.417
- Yeah?

01:09.460 --> 01:11.027
- You know, if you really want
a banana,

01:11.071 --> 01:12.333
I could always go
in the kitchen--

01:12.376 --> 01:14.074
- No, no.
No, I don't need a banana.

01:14.117 --> 01:15.336
This all looks awesome.

01:15.379 --> 01:18.991
I mean, the pancakes
are really...

01:19.035 --> 01:20.254
round.

01:20.297 --> 01:23.561
Excited to taste 'em

01:23.605 --> 01:25.607
with my mouth.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.918
Oh, my God.

01:32.962 --> 01:35.399
When did you learn to--

01:35.443 --> 01:37.575
I mean, these are really good.

01:37.619 --> 01:39.360
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:42.276 --> 01:44.408
Is this fresh-squeezed?

01:44.452 --> 01:45.714
- Mm-hmm.

01:45.757 --> 01:47.585
Oh, um...

01:47.629 --> 01:51.807
we may or may not now own
a very expensive juicer.

01:53.548 --> 01:56.072
- Gotta say, you're full
of surprises this morning.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.901
- Well, the day is young.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.207
- Mm-hmm.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.165
Wait, how did you have time

02:02.209 --> 02:03.601
to get a spread like this
together?

02:03.645 --> 02:05.821
I mean, it sounded
like yesterday was insane.

02:05.864 --> 02:07.431
- Yeah, it was,

02:07.475 --> 02:10.347
which is why Team Citizen
is regrouping

02:10.391 --> 02:12.306
before we go after
Carver again.

02:12.349 --> 02:15.222
And as for all this,

02:15.265 --> 02:17.137
thank God for 24-hour
grocery stores.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.573
- Amen.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.357
- This is your reminder.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.446
You have a reservation
at Giovanni's

02:22.490 --> 02:24.709
February 14th at 7:00 p.m.

02:24.753 --> 02:25.928
- You know what?

02:25.971 --> 02:27.538
If we also made a reservation
for tonight,

02:27.582 --> 02:29.149
we could up our chances

02:29.192 --> 02:31.673
of having an emergency-free
Valentine's Day dinner.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.805
- Well, I don't care
when we have dinner,

02:33.849 --> 02:36.156
as long as we're together.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.722
- Alexa, set a reminder

02:37.766 --> 02:39.898
to call Giovanni's
today at noon.

02:39.942 --> 02:41.378
- Okay, I'll remind you.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.598
- Great.
You finish eating.

02:43.641 --> 02:46.035
- I will.
- I'm gonna go take a shower.

02:46.078 --> 02:48.777
- Okay.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.822
You're amazing.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.263
- Son of a motherless goat.

02:56.306 --> 02:59.135
You do not want to test me.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.442
- Ah, thank God it's just you.

03:01.485 --> 03:04.401
- You're out of tape.

03:04.445 --> 03:06.229
- Did you just let yourself in?

03:06.273 --> 03:07.491
- Relax.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.580
I'm not some whack job
meta-killer

03:09.624 --> 03:12.844
with crazy good aim
and ulterior motives.

03:12.888 --> 03:14.324
Anymore.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.674
- Another house call
from Dr. Light would suck,

03:16.718 --> 03:19.329
but I was actually talking
about Nash.

03:19.373 --> 03:23.072
He's a total stage-one clinger.

03:23.115 --> 03:24.465
Didn't you get shot yesterday?

03:24.508 --> 03:25.857
Shouldn't you be soaking

03:25.901 --> 03:28.382
in a tub of frozen peas
or something?

03:28.425 --> 03:31.123
- And miss out on my first
Valentine's Day?

03:31.167 --> 03:32.124
No way!

03:32.168 --> 03:33.517
- I hate Valentine's Day,

03:33.561 --> 03:36.825
and I have a lot of work to do,
so...

03:36.868 --> 03:38.653
- You know,
it's my understanding

03:38.696 --> 03:40.089
that there are two kinds
of people

03:40.132 --> 03:41.873
who hate Valentine's Day.

03:41.917 --> 03:44.441
One, those who think
it's a made-up holiday

03:44.485 --> 03:45.660
by Big Candy,

03:45.703 --> 03:47.009
or two,

03:47.052 --> 03:48.967
those with a broken heart.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.882
I think you're the second one.

03:50.926 --> 03:52.362
- No.
I'm not.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.886
- Really?
I think actually you are.

03:54.930 --> 03:58.281
And I think
Mr. Emerson Fairweather

03:58.325 --> 04:01.284
is the emo dope
who's responsible.

04:03.895 --> 04:06.115
- We met after a gig
his band played.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.247
- Mm-hmm.

04:07.290 --> 04:10.554
- Anyway, it didn't work out.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.948
- "Another Valentine's Day
waiting for love.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.079
"Let the drinking begin.

04:14.123 --> 04:16.995
#CoffeeNotCocktails."

04:17.039 --> 04:18.258
Ugh!

04:18.301 --> 04:19.476
Look, you're perfect
for each other.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.564
You have something in common.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.392
You're both miserable.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.481
Thanks for the reminder.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.918
- You know, maybe you
and Mr. Fall Out Boy

04:26.962 --> 04:29.312
can go off and be mopey
together,

04:29.356 --> 04:31.575
and then you wouldn't hate
Valentine's Day.

04:31.619 --> 04:32.837
- I'm sorry, have we met?

04:32.881 --> 04:34.012
- Look, says here

04:34.056 --> 04:36.276
he's gonna be back
at Jitters tomorrow.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.669
And you know what?
So are we.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.889
'Cause I'm gonna get
the two of you back together

04:40.932 --> 04:42.760
for some V-Day love.

04:42.804 --> 04:44.849
Cupid demands it.

04:47.243 --> 04:48.723
- What?

04:49.985 --> 04:51.813
- I'm glad we decided
to do dinner tonight.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.555
It's awesome celebrating
Valentine's together,

04:54.598 --> 04:56.034
even if it's early.

04:56.078 --> 04:57.384
- Yeah.

04:57.427 --> 05:01.692
No Crisis, no dark future
looming over us.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.128
- Feels nice.

05:03.172 --> 05:04.565
- It really does.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.306
- Buonasera.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.355
- I'm so sorry.
We don't speak Italian.

05:16.446 --> 05:18.753
And can we just get
another minute?

05:18.796 --> 05:20.494
Grazie.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.412
- Uh...

05:25.455 --> 05:26.500
- What?

05:26.543 --> 05:28.850
- What--
do you speak Italian?

05:28.893 --> 05:30.025
- Oh, well--

05:30.068 --> 05:31.548
you know that story
that I was writing

05:31.592 --> 05:34.595
a few months ago
on Little Italy?

05:34.638 --> 05:37.337
Well, I picked up
a phrase or two.

05:37.380 --> 05:40.470
Like porca miseria.

05:40.514 --> 05:41.819
It's a curse word,

05:41.863 --> 05:44.213
but it literally means
"pig misery."

05:44.256 --> 05:45.562
Yeah, weird, right?

05:50.306 --> 05:53.831
- Roses are red,

05:53.875 --> 05:56.399
violets are blue,

05:56.443 --> 06:00.185
step forward, Saul Frankel,

06:00.229 --> 06:04.102
or I'll kill all of you.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.847
Ah.

06:09.891 --> 06:13.155
And they say chivalry is dead.

06:13.198 --> 06:14.678
Hand over the case, Love.

06:14.722 --> 06:17.072
- You know what will happen
if you take this.

06:18.421 --> 06:22.556
- I know what will happen
to you

06:22.599 --> 06:25.689
if I don't.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.054
Darlings!

06:43.098 --> 06:46.231
Long time no see.

06:46.275 --> 06:47.755
Did I interrupt date night?

06:47.798 --> 06:49.496
- CCPD.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.715
Amunet Black,
I'm placing you under arrest

06:51.759 --> 06:53.543
for robbery
and aggravated assault.

06:53.587 --> 06:57.547
- So very official, Mr. Allen.

06:57.591 --> 06:59.462
But aren't you just a CSI?

06:59.506 --> 07:01.899
- I'm still a cop
who can arrest you.

07:01.943 --> 07:02.726
- Oh, okay.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.075
Well, by all means,

07:04.119 --> 07:05.642
let me help you
with the first bit.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.472
I have the right
to remain silent,

07:09.516 --> 07:11.256
which will come in handy

07:11.300 --> 07:14.738
if you don't want me letting
that little secret identity cat

07:14.782 --> 07:19.264
out of its flashy red bag.

07:19.308 --> 07:21.310
So why don't we just
call this a warning.

07:21.353 --> 07:23.443
I'll be on my way.
No harm.

07:23.486 --> 07:24.748
No cowl.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.576
- I'm supposed to just
let you leave?

07:26.620 --> 07:28.535
- Bloody right.

07:28.578 --> 07:30.319
Don't think of coming after me,

07:30.362 --> 07:32.452
'cause if I see you,

07:32.495 --> 07:34.541
or your onesie,

07:34.584 --> 07:37.544
or any one of
your frigid or bendy

07:37.587 --> 07:39.981
superhero friends,

07:40.024 --> 07:42.897
I will hold it against
all of you

07:42.940 --> 07:47.118
and tell the world
your real identities.

07:47.162 --> 07:49.077
Savvy?

07:49.120 --> 07:50.513
Hmm?

07:50.557 --> 07:51.949
That's right.

07:51.993 --> 07:54.561
Because behind every great man
is a woman

07:54.604 --> 07:56.084
rolling her eyes.

07:59.348 --> 08:02.264
Ta-ta, sweethearts!

08:07.182 --> 08:08.618
- So much for date night.

08:08.662 --> 08:10.968
- Pig misery.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.670
- There's no trace of Amunet?

08:16.713 --> 08:18.498
- It's like she vanished.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.151
- Yeah, she does that.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.327
- Were there any rumblings
that she was back in town?

08:22.371 --> 08:25.069
- None, but Captain West
has all officers searching

08:25.113 --> 08:25.896
on high alert.

08:25.940 --> 08:28.551
- All right, thanks, Korber.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.121
- Barry, Amunet has been
off the grid for so long

08:33.164 --> 08:34.165
that if she's back,

08:34.209 --> 08:36.037
it must be for something
big and bad,

08:36.080 --> 08:38.474
and I'm pretty sure it involves
that device that she stole.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.867
- I know.

08:39.910 --> 08:41.521
- Hey, don't worry.
We're gonna find her.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.131
- I just--I can't believe
I just stood there

08:43.174 --> 08:44.045
and let her walk out.

08:44.088 --> 08:45.568
- Barry, it's not your fault.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.614
We knew that her
knowing your identity

08:47.657 --> 08:48.832
would come back to bite us.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.181
- All right, well,
time to fight her

08:50.225 --> 08:51.879
the old-fashioned way.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.445
I'm gonna run some sweeps
of the city.

08:53.489 --> 08:54.882
- Whoa, whoa,
she said no onesies.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.710
- Please don't call it that.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.712
- What I'm trying to say is
we can't risk her

08:58.755 --> 09:00.540
putting Team Flash on blast.

09:00.583 --> 09:03.499
- Okay, but we also
can't do nothing.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.153
- Well, we won't.

09:05.196 --> 09:07.677
If you want to figure out
a criminal's plan,

09:07.721 --> 09:10.550
visit their playground.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.164
- This is a bad idea.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.383
- Challenging an entire
drug cartel to a knife fight,

09:18.427 --> 09:19.994
that's a bad idea.

09:20.037 --> 09:20.777
Fun, though.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.170
This, this is nothing.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.955
Just go over there
and talk to him.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.131
- He really does
look miserable.

09:27.175 --> 09:29.394
- I'm sure he's over there
working on some sad sack song

09:29.438 --> 09:31.005
to perform tomorrow night.

09:31.048 --> 09:34.051
Trust your awesome life coach,
and just get over there.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.053
- Well, what do I even say?
- I don't know.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.707
You said you could be yourself
around him,

09:37.751 --> 09:40.275
so go do that.

09:40.318 --> 09:43.060
- You're right.

09:47.238 --> 09:48.326
- Don't worry.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.502
I'm sure they're just
good friends.

09:54.637 --> 09:57.945
- A really good friend.

09:59.686 --> 10:02.123
- Allegra--
- I knew this was a bad idea.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.821
Next time you want to play
life coach, don't.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.431
- Uh--

10:09.957 --> 10:11.915
- I still think it's better
if I go.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.613
- Babe, this is a known spot

10:13.656 --> 10:15.092
that Amunet used
to recruit her crew.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.920
Besides, a cop can't just
waltz in there.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.661
- Okay, but it's mostly
criminals in there.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.271
It's really dangerous.

10:20.315 --> 10:22.665
- Barry, it's my job to get
information out of people.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.101
Amunet's not gonna be there,

10:24.145 --> 10:26.756
but if someone knows
where she's headed next,

10:26.800 --> 10:29.063
I can get them to talk.
It's what I do.

10:29.106 --> 10:32.109
Besides, if things get dicey,
we have our code word.

10:32.153 --> 10:33.241
- Banana.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.243
- You hear that,
you come fathwooming.

10:35.286 --> 10:36.636
- Mm-hmm.

10:36.679 --> 10:39.595
Okay, fine.
Just be safe, please.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.249
- Scout's honor.

11:05.012 --> 11:07.754
- ♪ Mother your prodigal's
come in ♪

11:07.797 --> 11:11.322
- Whiskey, rocks.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.107
- You look familiar.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.632
- He must read the "Citizen."
Get out.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.983
Get out.
Get out of there, Iris.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.725
- Maybe I have
one of those faces.

11:22.769 --> 11:25.380
I'm looking for Amunet Black.

11:33.127 --> 11:34.694
- You don't seem like her type.

11:41.570 --> 11:44.312
- Got a problem, Lars?

11:47.489 --> 11:48.708
- Banana.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.187
Banana.
Banana!

11:50.231 --> 11:51.841
Banana.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.713
Banana, banana.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.192
Banana, Iris!

11:55.236 --> 11:57.804
- Now do I seem like her type?

11:57.847 --> 11:59.588
- Seems like I need
a new bouncer.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.592
You interested?

12:03.635 --> 12:06.029
- I'll keep it in mind.

12:06.073 --> 12:09.206
Now for the last time,
where is Amunet?

12:09.250 --> 12:11.208
- Last I heard,

12:11.252 --> 12:14.559
she was heisting
some specialized tech

12:14.603 --> 12:15.822
from this spot.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.998
- ♪ 'Cause we like it hard

12:18.041 --> 12:20.478
♪ Oh lord lost and found

12:20.522 --> 12:23.568
♪ Give my soul
and I'll take the crown ♪

12:23.612 --> 12:27.050
♪ Oh lord on my side

12:27.094 --> 12:29.139
- Thanks for the drink.

12:31.011 --> 12:33.056
- Hey, what happened?
I heard glass breaking.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.711
- Nothing. I broke a bottle
over some loser's head.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.582
- You what?
- Barry, don't worry.

12:37.626 --> 12:38.932
Everything's fine.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.890
I was playing a role
to get information.

12:40.934 --> 12:44.415
- Okay, well, that was maybe
crossing a line.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.374
- I'm sure they have
some sort of mob doctor

12:46.417 --> 12:47.462
in there somewhere.

12:47.505 --> 12:48.898
- Okay, but, I mean,
it was reckless,

12:48.942 --> 12:50.421
and it could've backfired.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.728
- But it didn't, because
I knew what I was doing.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.295
And we got this.

12:56.950 --> 12:59.648
- Is this Amunet's next target?

12:59.691 --> 13:00.780
- Let's go get her.

13:05.872 --> 13:09.136
- Ooh, I do love loud noises.

13:09.179 --> 13:10.964
Yeah.

13:15.969 --> 13:18.493
For the lady
who has everything.

13:26.936 --> 13:29.460
- Well, your source
at the bar was right.

13:29.504 --> 13:30.810
She's here.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.812
- Yeah, but what is she doing?

13:32.855 --> 13:34.465
Any idea what that tech is?

13:34.509 --> 13:36.032
- No.

13:36.076 --> 13:38.818
But I'm betting it's connected
to the first device she stole.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.297
We have to figure out
how to stop her,

13:40.341 --> 13:42.386
before things get--

13:52.614 --> 13:53.920
Worse.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.791
- Just what I was looking for.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.793
- Goldface is working
with Amunet?

13:57.837 --> 14:00.100
- Well, they did used to date.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.842
- You're too late, Keith.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.148
- Oh, Leslie.

14:05.192 --> 14:07.150
You know I can't let you leave
with that.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.500
- I don't think
they're working together.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.633
- No.

14:11.676 --> 14:12.895
This is a gang war.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.036
- I suppose you're here

14:23.079 --> 14:26.474
to steal what's mine.

14:26.517 --> 14:27.562
Typical.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.172
- What's yours?

14:29.216 --> 14:32.175
Baby, that device
belongs to me.

14:32.219 --> 14:33.785
- Oh, here we go again

14:33.829 --> 14:36.310
with the possessive man
routine.

14:36.353 --> 14:38.921
The vinyl records were mine,
Keith.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.924
- Since when did you
like Radiohead?

14:41.968 --> 14:44.709
I had "OK Computer"
on 180 gram vinyl

14:44.753 --> 14:46.711
with a triple gatefold sleeve!

14:46.755 --> 14:49.932
Overrated.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.368
- You skipped out

14:51.412 --> 14:53.283
with my "Straight
Outta Compton" soundtrack!

14:53.327 --> 14:55.024
- Oh, please, like you even
knew who N.W.A were

14:55.068 --> 14:56.112
before you met me!

14:56.156 --> 14:59.986
- Security, freeze!

15:00.029 --> 15:03.119
Don't anybody move.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.121
- Took some doing
setting up that deal,

15:05.165 --> 15:08.777
and you just stroll out
of Giovanni's with my score?

15:08.820 --> 15:09.909
- Sorry not sorry.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.562
- Baby.
- I said freeze!

15:11.606 --> 15:14.739
- You know I'm not letting it
go down like that.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.441
- Oh, come on.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.618
- Looks like somebody's lost
their touch.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.925
- I said put your hands
in the air!

15:25.968 --> 15:27.622
- Really?

15:27.665 --> 15:30.581
Looks to me like somebody's
lost their gym membership.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.595
- Barry.
- What?

15:44.639 --> 15:46.249
- It'll be bad if Amunet knows
the Flash is here.

15:46.293 --> 15:47.772
- Yeah, but that guard might
get really hurt.

15:47.816 --> 15:50.775
I have to do something.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.911
- Yeah, well,
no amount of gym time

15:55.955 --> 15:57.913
could help me lift
all your baggage!

16:08.184 --> 16:11.971
Still strong enough
to lift this though.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.711
- You okay?
You okay?

16:13.755 --> 16:16.497
- Bye, Felicia.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.805
- How did you lift that?

16:20.849 --> 16:23.983
- Uh...adrenaline.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.202
Stay here, okay?
You'll be okay.

16:26.246 --> 16:28.509
Probably.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.033
Where are they?

16:31.077 --> 16:32.556
- Gone.
- What?

16:32.600 --> 16:34.732
Well, let's go after them.
We have to get the case.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.299
- Who needs the case

16:36.343 --> 16:38.606
when you've got what's inside?

16:45.352 --> 16:47.136
- Ah.
Oh, my God.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.747
- Hey.
Did you find anything?

16:49.791 --> 16:50.966
- Uh-uh.

16:51.010 --> 16:51.967
- Why are you so tired?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.534
- I don't know, I mean--

16:53.577 --> 16:55.492
I mean, to keep Amunet
and Goldface from seeing me,

16:55.536 --> 16:57.364
I had to run so fast
I was practically invisible,

16:57.407 --> 16:59.453
but it's getting bad out there.

16:59.496 --> 17:02.021
I mean, their gangs
are just trading attacks.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.023
It's like both sides think

17:04.066 --> 17:06.155
that the other
has the second device.

17:06.199 --> 17:07.417
- Yeah.
I called my dad.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.071
He said that Amunet
and Goldface

17:09.115 --> 17:10.464
are sticking
to criminal targets

17:10.507 --> 17:13.684
like each other's
stash houses, but...

17:13.728 --> 17:15.382
I don't know, I think

17:15.425 --> 17:16.905
they're trying to hurt
each other,

17:16.948 --> 17:18.037
not just their businesses.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.386
- Okay.
All right.

17:19.429 --> 17:20.952
Well, until we know
what they're after,

17:20.996 --> 17:23.216
I guess I'll just keep
patrolling at super speed.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.608
I'm just worried
some innocent people

17:24.652 --> 17:26.219
are gonna get caught
in their crossfire

17:26.262 --> 17:28.438
while we wait for this thing
to blow over.

17:28.482 --> 17:31.267
- I don't think it will, Barry.

17:31.311 --> 17:35.010
When Amunet and Goldface
were arguing at Ivo,

17:35.054 --> 17:36.794
they used each other's
real names.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.796
They argued about
an old record collection.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.059
That's personal.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.582
Personal doesn't just
blow over.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.540
- But what's personal
about stealing tech?

17:43.584 --> 17:45.194
- Okay, so I called Ryan Choi.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.066
The first item
that Amunet stole?

17:47.109 --> 17:48.893
A specialized UV projector.

17:48.937 --> 17:52.114
The second item was a biome
simulated storage unit.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.550
If you combine the two,
it can be used

17:53.594 --> 17:55.944
to transport delicate,
plant-based life.

17:55.987 --> 17:58.468
- They're after a plant?
Why?

17:58.512 --> 17:59.556
I don't know.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.341
But if those two are after it,

18:01.384 --> 18:03.517
it's probably dangerous.
- Yeah.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.736
- So a botanist source I used
from an old story

18:05.780 --> 18:06.998
is looking into it,

18:07.042 --> 18:09.131
but I think there's
a faster way

18:09.175 --> 18:12.526
to figure this out.

18:12.569 --> 18:15.224
We give Amunet what she wants.

18:15.268 --> 18:16.878
- What?
- Yeah.

18:16.921 --> 18:19.315
We use the leverage we have,
we get close to Amunet,

18:19.359 --> 18:21.056
and we solve this thing
from the inside.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.231
- No.

18:22.275 --> 18:25.104
I mean,
that's way too dangerous.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.757
I mean, Amunet knows
both of us.

18:26.801 --> 18:27.976
- So?

18:28.019 --> 18:30.935
- So we stay put.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.981
- You mean I stay put

18:33.024 --> 18:34.765
while you patrol.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.158
- Well, I mean--

18:36.202 --> 18:37.942
- You're the Flash.
You know best, right?

18:37.986 --> 18:39.509
- What?
Iris, come on.

18:39.553 --> 18:40.945
I mean, look at the facts--

18:40.989 --> 18:42.033
- Screw facts, Barry.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.252
I trust my intuition.

18:43.296 --> 18:44.471
My intuition, by the way,

18:44.514 --> 18:46.212
that saved my life
from an assassin

18:46.255 --> 18:48.605
while you were on some island.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.520
- What?

18:50.564 --> 18:53.306
What's--okay,
what's going on?

18:53.349 --> 18:54.568
It feels like ever since

18:54.611 --> 18:56.526
you came back home
the other night,

18:56.570 --> 18:58.180
you've been acting
kind of different.

18:58.224 --> 19:01.792
I mean, the pancakes
and the bottle smashing--

19:01.836 --> 19:03.664
- Do you hear yourself
right now, Barry?

19:03.707 --> 19:05.144
Seriously?

19:05.187 --> 19:07.972
My New Year's resolution?
Learn how to make pancakes.

19:08.016 --> 19:11.628
And I told you
that I was playing a role.

19:11.672 --> 19:12.977
Come on, Barry.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.109
You know what?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.545
Actually,

19:15.589 --> 19:19.201
I didn't forget my files
at the office last night.

19:19.245 --> 19:22.509
I was following up on a lead,
so there.

19:22.552 --> 19:25.294
- You were following a lead
in the middle of the night?

19:25.338 --> 19:26.991
I mean, something
could have happened to you.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.689
- That, Barry.
That right there.

19:28.732 --> 19:31.082
That's why I didn't tell you.
I don't need you to save me.

19:31.126 --> 19:32.997
I can handle myself.

19:33.041 --> 19:35.217
I even have my own team now,
Team Citizen.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.740
- I know.
- And you know what?

19:36.784 --> 19:39.352
While you were preoccupied
with Crisis,

19:39.395 --> 19:42.006
I was planning to start a life
without you,

19:42.050 --> 19:44.313
and it was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do,

19:44.357 --> 19:47.316
but I did it
because you asked me to, Barry.

19:48.709 --> 19:51.973
I would do anything for you,
and you know that,

19:52.016 --> 19:55.194
but I can't be your damsel
in distress anymore,

19:55.237 --> 19:57.326
and I cannot be the voice
inside your cowl

19:57.370 --> 19:59.546
cheering you on.

19:59.589 --> 20:02.766
I'm a reporter, Barry,
and I'm a damn good one,

20:02.810 --> 20:05.987
and risky or not,
I deserve to be in that field

20:06.030 --> 20:07.815
just as much as you do.

20:07.858 --> 20:11.210
- I know that.

20:11.253 --> 20:14.038
It just feels like--

20:14.082 --> 20:17.216
I mean--it doesn't feel
like we're connecting lately.

20:17.259 --> 20:20.219
- I've grown, Barry.

20:20.262 --> 20:23.570
And I'm really proud
of the person that I am today.

20:25.267 --> 20:28.444
I just wish that you felt
the same way too.

20:28.488 --> 20:31.230
- Come on, I--
Iris.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.463
- Oh.

20:47.507 --> 20:49.900
It's just you.

20:49.944 --> 20:53.382
Yeah, I thought, you know,
maybe it might be the--

20:53.426 --> 20:55.776
you know, the girl, the--

20:55.819 --> 20:56.951
what's her name?

20:56.994 --> 20:58.257
Abbondanza.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.302
- Allegra?

21:00.346 --> 21:02.043
- Yeah, Allegra.
That's her.

21:02.086 --> 21:03.392
- Why are you looking for her?

21:03.436 --> 21:05.699
- She's--she's--this--

21:05.742 --> 21:08.267
nano-dimensional bucket auger,
it's hers,

21:08.310 --> 21:09.659
and she wanted--
I was bucket augering,

21:09.703 --> 21:11.139
but now she wants
to bucket auger,

21:11.182 --> 21:12.967
so I was like--
anyway, what are you doing?

21:13.010 --> 21:14.447
Sitting here drinking
by yourself?

21:14.490 --> 21:16.579
- Yes, Valentine's Day drinking

21:16.623 --> 21:18.407
to celebrate
what a screw-up I am.

21:18.451 --> 21:19.800
- What is that?

21:19.843 --> 21:21.018
- Naltorian mead,

21:21.062 --> 21:23.238
left to us
by one of the previous Wells.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.415
You know, back when there were
other Wells in the multiverse.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.419
Sorry.

21:30.463 --> 21:32.116
Nash, I didn't--

21:32.160 --> 21:35.032
- It's fine.
It's fine.

21:35.076 --> 21:37.339
- See what I mean?

21:37.383 --> 21:40.560
Everything I touch
turns out sucking.

21:40.603 --> 21:42.736
I mean, how do I explain
to Ralph

21:42.779 --> 21:44.694
that he's wasted
the last five months

21:44.738 --> 21:46.740
trying to teach me
how to be a better person?

21:46.783 --> 21:50.352
'Cause doesn't matter
how much litter I pick up,

21:50.396 --> 21:52.528
how many sick kids I read to,

21:52.572 --> 21:54.617
I still don't get people.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.576
I really thought
I could help Allegra

21:56.619 --> 21:58.099
fall back in love
with her ex,

21:58.142 --> 22:01.494
but instead, I just made
a mess of everything.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.326
- You know, you got lost.

22:07.369 --> 22:10.154
Now you just get back
on the highway,

22:10.198 --> 22:12.243
and find new inroads

22:12.287 --> 22:15.029
with this Allegra.

22:15.072 --> 22:16.813
Easy-peasy.

22:16.857 --> 22:18.554
You know, I don't know her
very well,

22:18.598 --> 22:19.990
but perhaps
she's one of those people

22:20.034 --> 22:21.949
that just sees things
in absolutes, right?

22:21.992 --> 22:22.950
Black and white.

22:22.993 --> 22:25.387
Missions fail or succeed.
Right?

22:25.431 --> 22:27.346
You know what you need to do?

22:27.389 --> 22:28.651
You need to get back in there
with her.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.523
Open her up and show her

22:30.566 --> 22:32.786
that things aren't just black
and white, you know?

22:32.829 --> 22:35.484
Black and white,
that's just for...

22:35.528 --> 22:39.401
death and taxes.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.751
Everything else,

22:41.795 --> 22:44.275
everything else happens
in the grays.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.157
Ehh!

22:58.246 --> 23:00.204
- Wow.

23:00.248 --> 23:01.684
Someone's not a fan.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.516
- Mrs. Flash?

23:07.560 --> 23:11.433
However did you find
your way here?

23:11.477 --> 23:14.393
- Well, there is
a very charming bartender

23:14.436 --> 23:15.655
that is giving out tips

23:15.698 --> 23:17.483
rather than collecting them,
so--

23:17.526 --> 23:20.050
- Lars.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.401
I'll have to kill him.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.880
Hmm.
Ladies first.

23:23.924 --> 23:25.708
- Ah, wait.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.057
I know what you're after.

23:30.539 --> 23:33.194
And I want in.

23:33.237 --> 23:34.891
- Hmm?

23:42.769 --> 23:44.248
- So let me get this straight.

23:44.292 --> 23:45.902
Iris West-Allen,

23:45.946 --> 23:47.774
a skyrocketing
news media force,

23:47.817 --> 23:49.123
daughter of the police captain,

23:49.166 --> 23:51.125
devoted spouse
of the Scarlet Speedster,

23:51.168 --> 23:52.996
all of that,

23:53.040 --> 23:54.781
and I'm supposed to believe
you're willing

23:54.824 --> 23:58.567
to give me an invaluable piece
of stolen tech?

23:58.611 --> 24:02.266
Why, exactly?

24:02.310 --> 24:03.746
- Rappaccini's Daughter.

24:03.790 --> 24:06.445
A rare orchid recently shipped
for study

24:06.488 --> 24:08.098
at CC Arboretum.

24:08.142 --> 24:10.144
- And why on this
great big blue marble

24:10.187 --> 24:13.103
do you think that I would be
interested in that?

24:13.147 --> 24:14.714
- Well, because
what makes it rare

24:14.757 --> 24:18.108
isn't that it blooms
every 25 years.

24:18.152 --> 24:19.980
It's the flower's pollen.

24:20.023 --> 24:22.156
When adequately heated,
it can be synthesized

24:22.199 --> 24:25.159
into a telepathic narcotic.

24:25.202 --> 24:26.769
If you can read minds,

24:26.813 --> 24:29.598
it would be much easier
to gain access to PIN numbers

24:29.642 --> 24:32.471
to big, fat bank accounts.

24:33.994 --> 24:35.865
- Bravo!

24:35.909 --> 24:37.214
Well done!

24:39.956 --> 24:43.438
But you didn't answer
the most important question.

24:46.615 --> 24:50.532
Why the bloody hell
should I believe you?

24:50.576 --> 24:53.535
- Because I want to use
the pollen.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.842
- For what?

24:55.885 --> 24:59.541
- Well, as you know,
I am married to the Flash,

24:59.585 --> 25:01.543
and he's a man who has a lot
on his mind.

25:01.587 --> 25:02.849
- Mm-hmm.

25:02.892 --> 25:05.895
- And lately,
that hasn't been me.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.029
And to tell you the truth,

25:09.072 --> 25:10.900
I'm afraid that
all this superhero-ing

25:10.944 --> 25:13.990
is ruining my marriage.

25:14.034 --> 25:17.472
But if I could use the pollen,

25:17.516 --> 25:20.649
then I could read his mind.

25:20.693 --> 25:23.609
- Oh, why didn't you just
say so?

25:23.652 --> 25:26.350
That I can believe!

25:26.394 --> 25:28.831
Girl, I am no stranger

25:28.875 --> 25:31.573
to roguish means for love.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.314
- You mean you and Goldface.

25:33.357 --> 25:34.837
- Men.

25:34.881 --> 25:36.926
They're all idiots.
Who needs them?

25:40.060 --> 25:44.194
This could be the start
of a beautiful friendship!

25:47.415 --> 25:49.373
Come along.

25:49.417 --> 25:51.027
We're going flower shopping.

25:57.251 --> 25:58.905
- Goldface's gang

25:58.948 --> 26:02.386
is throwing Molotov cocktails

26:02.430 --> 26:04.563
at one of Amunet's warehouses.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.216
They are retaliating

26:06.260 --> 26:08.392
by sinking
their latest delivery boat.

26:08.436 --> 26:11.570
I mean, I know it's criminal
on criminal attacks right now,

26:11.613 --> 26:14.050
but if we don't stop it,
I mean,

26:14.094 --> 26:17.401
it could be
a Valentine's Day massacre

26:17.445 --> 26:18.881
where civilians get hurt.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.622
- Yeah, no,
I'll keep doing sweeps.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.581
I'll help wherever I can.
- Mm.

26:22.624 --> 26:26.715
Well, I might have to roll out
a special meta taskforce.

26:26.759 --> 26:28.848
Can you pull together
Team Flash?

26:28.891 --> 26:31.067
- No, I can't.
I mean, she knows them all.

26:31.111 --> 26:34.288
I have to protect
their identities too.

26:35.506 --> 26:38.684
You know what, Joe,
there's something not right

26:38.727 --> 26:42.035
about this Amunet-Goldface
thing, and...

26:42.078 --> 26:44.298
Iris thinks there's
something personal going on.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.387
- Well, I mean, I do wish
they were still a couple.

26:46.430 --> 26:49.433
I mean, things were a lot
quieter out there and safer.

26:49.477 --> 26:51.392
- Some Valentine's Day, huh?

26:51.435 --> 26:53.612
- Mm-hmm.

26:53.655 --> 26:56.440
Barry.

26:56.484 --> 26:58.791
You've been looking down a lot.

26:58.834 --> 27:01.707
My floor's not that
interesting, so what's up?

27:06.320 --> 27:08.191
It's Iris.

27:08.235 --> 27:10.150
I mean, she--I don't know,
it's just something

27:10.193 --> 27:12.674
that's suddenly off between us,

27:12.718 --> 27:15.677
or at least it feels
sudden to me.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.636
- And what'd she say
about that?

27:17.679 --> 27:19.942
- She's grown,

27:19.986 --> 27:22.858
and I haven't accepted it.

27:22.902 --> 27:24.643
- Mm, I don't know
about that second part,

27:24.686 --> 27:26.253
but that first part?

27:26.296 --> 27:27.689
She has grown.

27:27.733 --> 27:30.692
She took down
a Black Hole assassin.

27:30.736 --> 27:31.867
- And she led the charge

27:31.911 --> 27:33.652
to find Ryan Choi
during Crisis.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.218
- And she was the only one

27:35.262 --> 27:38.308
who knew that Rosso hadn't
completely taken you over.

27:38.352 --> 27:41.703
I mean, what does that
sound like to you?

27:41.747 --> 27:43.662
I know.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.011
I mean, she has grown,

27:45.054 --> 27:47.840
and I guess she was right.

27:47.883 --> 27:49.798
I mean, I didn't notice

27:49.842 --> 27:52.714
because I was consumed
with Crisis.

27:52.758 --> 27:56.239
We're just not clicking
like usual though.

27:58.241 --> 28:02.811
Do you think maybe
she's grown apart?

28:02.855 --> 28:04.987
- Barry, no.
No.

28:05.031 --> 28:06.902
Neither one of you
are ever gonna stop growing.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.469
I mean,
marriage is like a tree.

28:08.512 --> 28:09.600
I mean, bear with me.

28:09.644 --> 28:11.515
Look, the branches,

28:11.559 --> 28:13.517
they grow from the center.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.955
They grow farther and farther
away from the center,

28:15.998 --> 28:18.348
but what you have to remember
is underneath,

28:18.392 --> 28:19.567
the roots?

28:19.610 --> 28:21.090
They're mirroring the branches.

28:21.134 --> 28:22.526
They're growing just as much.

28:22.570 --> 28:24.964
So you're growing
your foundation.

28:25.007 --> 28:26.835
Now of course,
you gotta tend to the soil,

28:26.879 --> 28:28.358
communicate with each other,

28:28.402 --> 28:30.056
take care of each other,

28:30.099 --> 28:33.799
look out for each other, but...

28:33.842 --> 28:37.628
as the branches grow,

28:37.672 --> 28:39.761
so does your foundation.

28:39.805 --> 28:42.198
So you grow together.

28:48.901 --> 28:51.773
- Art therapy.
Been there.

28:51.817 --> 28:54.994
- Look, I'm sorry
about Jitters.

28:55.037 --> 28:56.691
I know you meant well.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.040
- No, I'm sorry.

28:58.084 --> 29:01.696
Look, my life coach
made my life better.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.481
I was just trying
to pay it forward.

29:04.525 --> 29:07.833
I probably should've gotten
the whole story

29:07.876 --> 29:09.573
about your breakup

29:09.617 --> 29:12.228
before trying to intervene.

29:12.272 --> 29:15.144
- I guess I haven't exactly
been an open book.

29:15.188 --> 29:18.060
- Why don't you start
from page one?

29:19.235 --> 29:21.063
- After I got out
of Iron Heights,

29:21.107 --> 29:22.848
I wanted to take a shot

29:22.891 --> 29:25.807
at living a normal,
non-meta life.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.809
That's when I met Emerson.

29:27.853 --> 29:30.203
We became friends.

29:30.246 --> 29:32.727
Then we went on a few dates.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.556
Had some laughs.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.558
But it ran its course,

29:37.601 --> 29:39.734
so I dropped it.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.518
- You ghosted him.

29:41.562 --> 29:42.737
- Kind of.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.521
- Why?

29:52.007 --> 29:55.054
You didn't want him to find out
you're a meta.

29:55.097 --> 29:57.099
- Back then, I could barely
deal with my powers.

29:57.143 --> 30:00.102
How could I expect
someone else to?

30:00.146 --> 30:01.974
Anyway, it was never
gonna work between us.

30:02.017 --> 30:04.106
- You don't know that.

30:04.150 --> 30:05.847
I mean, you never gave him
a chance

30:05.891 --> 30:07.631
to find out who you really are.

30:07.675 --> 30:08.937
- It doesn't matter now.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.809
He probably hates me
for ghosting him.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.375
- Are you sure?

30:12.419 --> 30:14.595
'Cause maybe he's been looking
for you every day since.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.553
Or maybe he forgot you existed.

30:16.597 --> 30:18.077
Whatever it is, you don't know

30:18.120 --> 30:19.861
because you've been
filling in the blanks

30:19.905 --> 30:21.820
without the facts.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.386
Coming clean to Emerson

30:23.430 --> 30:25.867
might actually make you feel
a lot better.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.173
And who knows?

30:27.216 --> 30:29.436
Maybe you'll get a friend
out of it.

30:29.479 --> 30:33.048
But you can't assume
that life happens

30:33.092 --> 30:34.310
in black and white,

30:34.354 --> 30:36.660
because life happens
in the gray,

30:36.704 --> 30:39.620
and you need to get out there
and live in it.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.802
- Keith and I
were like fireworks

30:47.846 --> 30:49.325
when we were together.

30:49.369 --> 30:53.460
We shared the same ambitions,
and it ignited us both.

30:53.503 --> 30:55.897
We inspired each other.

30:55.941 --> 30:59.640
Rappaccini's Daughter was meant
to be our greatest score ever.

30:59.683 --> 31:02.338
- Even though it only blooms
every 25 years?

31:02.382 --> 31:03.731
- What can I say?

31:03.774 --> 31:06.690
We were optimists,
making plans for the future.

31:06.734 --> 31:09.215
We knew that it was set
to bloom this year,

31:09.258 --> 31:11.913
and once we had our hands
on its mindreading powers,

31:11.957 --> 31:14.437
no one would be able
to stop us.

31:14.481 --> 31:17.614
We would run this town
together.

31:19.790 --> 31:23.620
I felt like I could be myself
when I was with him.

31:23.664 --> 31:26.754
He's the only one who ever saw
beyond all this.

31:26.797 --> 31:28.974
He saw me for me.

31:29.017 --> 31:31.672
- So what went wrong?

31:31.715 --> 31:36.459
- Hmm, as business boomed,
our relationship didn't.

31:36.503 --> 31:40.550
Our passion wilted

31:40.594 --> 31:43.684
and died.

31:43.727 --> 31:45.207
- I don't know, Amunet.

31:45.251 --> 31:47.166
The way you two were trying
to kill each other--

31:47.209 --> 31:50.952
- It's a fine line
between love and hate, my dear.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.736
- Thank you.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.956
Why don't you just tell him
how you feel?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.785
Talk to him.

31:57.828 --> 32:00.179
- No.

32:00.222 --> 32:02.572
I'm better off without him.

32:02.616 --> 32:06.707
And when I get my hands
on that flower,

32:06.750 --> 32:08.187
I'll run this town myself.

32:08.230 --> 32:09.971
Come, my lovelies.

32:16.978 --> 32:19.807
Hello, lover.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.504
- That case.

32:21.548 --> 32:25.073
It looks like a larger version
of the tech that you stole.

32:25.117 --> 32:28.207
- This orchid

32:28.250 --> 32:30.035
is a lot like love.

32:30.078 --> 32:31.340
It can only survive

32:31.384 --> 32:33.255
in a carefully tended
environment.

32:33.299 --> 32:35.257
That glass device you gave me

32:35.301 --> 32:38.304
is a miniature biome simulator.

32:38.347 --> 32:42.873
The UV projector
provides a nurturing light.

32:42.917 --> 32:46.355
Together,

32:46.399 --> 32:48.488
l'amour.

32:51.665 --> 32:54.798
- Flowers.

32:54.842 --> 32:56.452
You shouldn't have.

33:07.028 --> 33:09.639
- Seeing that you got the means
to transport the flower,

33:09.683 --> 33:11.815
I figured I'd take them both
from you at once.

33:11.859 --> 33:13.643
Consider it a Valentine's gift.

33:13.687 --> 33:16.777
- And here I thought we weren't
exchanging gifts this year.

33:24.698 --> 33:27.570
Happy Valentine's Day.

33:55.294 --> 33:56.643
- Barry, what are you doing?

33:56.686 --> 33:58.166
Amunet can't see
the Flash here.

33:58.210 --> 33:59.472
- I'm done playing her game,

33:59.515 --> 34:01.691
and I'll risk anything
to save you.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.954
Look, after piecing together
the leads that you dug up,

34:03.998 --> 34:05.217
it wasn't hard to figure out

34:05.260 --> 34:06.957
that they were after
Rappaccini's Daughter.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.350
They're gonna destroy
each other.

34:08.394 --> 34:09.873
- Not if they both accept
that they still

34:09.917 --> 34:11.527
have feelings for each other.

34:11.571 --> 34:13.529
- Joe did say things were
better when they were together.

34:13.573 --> 34:17.055
- My life got better
without you.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.534
You're dead weight.

34:18.578 --> 34:21.755
- You were the biggest mistake
I ever made!

34:23.713 --> 34:27.543
You always had this one
really bad habit.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.197
Breathing!

34:29.241 --> 34:33.158
You are nothing but a cheap,
bald Mr. T.

34:33.201 --> 34:34.724
- I'm gonna stop
their crossfire.

34:37.423 --> 34:41.296
- I'd rather date Norvock
than you.

34:41.340 --> 34:44.778
- That makes two of us!

34:46.127 --> 34:49.217
Your American accent sucks!

34:49.261 --> 34:50.697
- So does yours!

34:51.959 --> 34:54.135
- I'm from Connecticut.
I went to Yale.

34:54.179 --> 34:55.658
- Okay, stop.
Just stop this.

34:55.702 --> 34:57.399
You guys were happy together
once, right?

34:57.443 --> 34:59.314
Why'd you break up?
- I thought I said--

34:59.358 --> 35:00.924
- She stopped listening to me.

35:00.968 --> 35:02.926
I needed her support
when things went bad,

35:02.970 --> 35:04.580
not her cold shoulder.

35:04.624 --> 35:07.757
- I got tired of him always
celebrating with his posse

35:07.801 --> 35:10.369
and only coming to me to whine
about his failures.

35:10.412 --> 35:12.110
It got old!
- Okay, see?

35:12.153 --> 35:13.763
I mean, you guys
are talking now.

35:13.807 --> 35:16.244
This is great, right?

35:16.288 --> 35:17.941
- I said no onesie.

35:17.985 --> 35:20.292
- Okay, why does everybody
keep calling it that?

35:20.335 --> 35:21.728
- Whatever you call it,

35:21.771 --> 35:24.470
there's an awful lot of gold
in there, Flash.

35:24.513 --> 35:25.949
- Whoa.

35:31.694 --> 35:33.609
- Oh, God.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.617
- Now, where were we?

35:41.661 --> 35:43.141
- I was just about to tell you

35:43.184 --> 35:44.620
when I told you
I liked your dog?

35:44.664 --> 35:46.622
I lied!
I'm a cat person.

35:46.666 --> 35:49.190
- The mud mask you use at night
smells rank.

35:49.234 --> 35:52.062
Real mud smells better.

35:52.106 --> 35:54.456
Ow!

35:54.500 --> 35:56.589
Oh, that didn't feel great.

35:56.632 --> 35:59.635
Okay, it's no use.
There's no fixing them.

35:59.679 --> 36:01.811
- I have an idea,

36:01.855 --> 36:02.943
but it might be reckless.

36:02.986 --> 36:05.250
- What's the plan?

36:05.293 --> 36:06.816
- Burn the flower.

36:08.470 --> 36:11.343
- There you go again,
twirling your shiny spaghetti.

36:42.025 --> 36:43.505
- I'd hold you forever,

36:43.549 --> 36:45.942
but it still wouldn't be
enough time together.

36:45.986 --> 36:50.425
- The sight of your eyes
fills my heart with gold.

36:50.469 --> 36:52.775
- Did it work?

36:52.819 --> 36:54.429
- The stars at night
can only dream

36:54.473 --> 36:56.126
they'd ever shine
as bright as you.

36:56.170 --> 36:57.954
- I was always so proud
of the work you did at Yale.

36:57.998 --> 37:00.914
- Your natural mud mask
works wonders.

37:00.957 --> 37:02.524
- You complete me.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.352
- What's happening?

37:04.396 --> 37:06.354
- I missed you.

37:06.398 --> 37:08.922
- I missed you too.

37:08.965 --> 37:12.142
- ♪ Whoa

37:12.186 --> 37:14.928
♪ We are strong

37:15.972 --> 37:19.759
♪ No one can tell us
we're wrong ♪

37:20.977 --> 37:24.894

I should take off my gauntlet.

37:27.332 --> 37:28.942
- Leave it on, girl.

37:28.985 --> 37:30.465
Daddy likes the metal.

37:30.509 --> 37:32.467
- I can't unsee this.

37:32.511 --> 37:33.903
- Well, at least
it's less violent

37:33.947 --> 37:35.209
than a gang war?

37:36.776 --> 37:38.560
Barely. Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:38.604 --> 37:41.259
- More nicks
than I remember.

37:41.302 --> 37:42.999
- Happy Valentine's Day.

37:43.043 --> 37:46.002
- Happy Valentine's Day.

37:48.309 --> 37:50.398
- ♪ Love is a battlefield

37:58.798 --> 38:01.322
- How'd it go?
- Better than I thought.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.803
I said sorry for ghosting him.

38:03.846 --> 38:04.934
Told him why.

38:04.978 --> 38:06.284
He accepted my apology.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.329
- So he's fine with you
being a meta?

38:08.373 --> 38:09.722
- Yeah.

38:09.765 --> 38:13.073
Turns out his new drummer
is bioluminescent.

38:13.116 --> 38:16.119
Emerson and I
are gonna be friends again.

38:16.163 --> 38:17.773
And you know what?

38:17.817 --> 38:21.255
I think that's what I was
really missing this whole time.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.126
Him too,
he actually wants me to go

38:23.170 --> 38:25.955
take a look at his new lyrics
before he goes on stage.

38:25.999 --> 38:29.350
- Look at you.
Back to being a muse.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.961
- Yeah.

38:32.005 --> 38:34.442
So, thanks

38:34.486 --> 38:37.619
for your help
with all the gray life stuff.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.360
It's exactly what I needed
to hear.

38:39.404 --> 38:41.884
- You're welcome.

38:41.928 --> 38:43.799
Although I can't take
all the credit.

38:43.843 --> 38:45.714
A friend of mine did give me
some advice.

38:45.758 --> 38:47.934
- Well, tell them thanks too.

38:47.977 --> 38:50.850
They may not know me,
but they get me.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.988
Frost.
I mean...

38:59.032 --> 39:00.599
you.

39:00.642 --> 39:02.209
Got your message.
What's so important?

39:02.252 --> 39:04.342
- I thought you'd want to know
that Allegra was here

39:04.385 --> 39:06.866
so you could give her
your tool thingy.

39:06.909 --> 39:09.956
- The--are you kidding?
Really?

39:09.999 --> 39:11.392
You bring me to a crappy

39:11.436 --> 39:13.655
Valentine's Day open mic night
for that?

39:13.699 --> 39:14.917
- Well,

39:14.961 --> 39:17.485
also so I could tell you
that I owe you one.

39:17.529 --> 39:20.183
The advice you gave,
it really helped me

39:20.227 --> 39:22.011
get through to Allegra.

39:22.055 --> 39:25.232
It was very insightful.

39:25.275 --> 39:28.409
Almost parental.

39:31.543 --> 39:33.501
- You going somewhere
with that?

39:33.545 --> 39:35.677
- I'm just saying,
if you ever want to talk,

39:35.721 --> 39:39.202
like I said, I owe you one.

39:39.246 --> 39:42.423
And I'm a very good listener.

40:08.928 --> 40:11.017
- Hell of a Valentine's Day,
huh?

40:11.060 --> 40:13.541
- Next year, we lock ourselves
in the Time Vault

40:13.585 --> 40:16.762
and don't come out
till morning.

40:18.938 --> 40:20.722
Listen,

40:20.766 --> 40:24.030
I'm really sorry
that I made you feel

40:24.073 --> 40:27.425
like I wasn't seeing all
your success in a larger way.

40:27.468 --> 40:29.731
- Babe, it's fine.
- No, it's not.

40:29.775 --> 40:32.473
You've made a name
for yourself,

40:32.517 --> 40:35.476
and this city looks to you
and the "Citizen"

40:35.520 --> 40:37.739
for the truth
about what's going on.

40:37.783 --> 40:41.569
And I am so proud
of who you are

40:41.613 --> 40:44.964
and all of your
accomplishments.

40:45.007 --> 40:47.445
I just--

40:47.488 --> 40:51.187
for a moment today,
I felt like...

40:51.231 --> 40:52.754
maybe we were growing apart.

40:52.798 --> 40:54.669
- That will never happen.

40:54.713 --> 40:56.758
- I get that now.

40:56.802 --> 41:00.675
- And babe, just remember
that no matter what changes,

41:00.719 --> 41:04.462
you're always gonna be
my lightning rod too.

41:04.505 --> 41:06.812
- Iris West-Allen?
- Hmm?

41:06.855 --> 41:08.770
- Will you be my Valentine?

41:08.814 --> 41:10.946
- You read my mind.

41:27.180 --> 41:29.835
- Get away from him!

41:29.878 --> 41:31.097
Barry!

41:31.140 --> 41:33.403
That's not me!

41:33.447 --> 41:35.231
She's not me!

41:35.275 --> 41:38.147
Barry!

41:38.191 --> 41:40.672
Barry!

42:03.608 --> 42:05.174
- Greg, move your head.
