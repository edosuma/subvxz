You're getting
so fast, Minimus.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.666
And I haven't even
hit a tree yet.

01:09.369 --> 01:10.936
Who was that?

01:10.938 --> 01:12.538
It's Grandmum.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.906
Grand-who?

01:13.908 --> 01:15.174
My grandmother.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.209
I had no idea
she was visiting today.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.811
Come on.

01:22.282 --> 01:23.949
Come on!

01:23.951 --> 01:25.751
I can't believe
she only sent a messenger

01:25.753 --> 01:27.019
five minutes ahead.

01:27.021 --> 01:28.787
We have no time
to get ready.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.290
It will be
fine, Roland.
Don't worry.

01:31.292 --> 01:34.293
My mother is very prim
and proper, Miranda.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.728
Everything needs
to be perfect.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.297
Roll out
the red carpet!

01:42.102 --> 01:43.402
( giggling )

01:43.404 --> 01:45.204
Sorry, Your Majesty.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.206
Let's go,
let's go.

01:53.413 --> 01:55.481
Wait here.
I'll be right back.

01:56.483 --> 01:58.617
Sofia, Grandmother
is coming.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.053
I know.
I just saw her carriage.

02:01.055 --> 02:03.922
Be alert, everyone.
Mind your manners.

02:03.924 --> 02:06.058
And remember,
your grandmother
is very traditional.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.494
Trumpets!
Don't forget the trumpets!

02:09.796 --> 02:12.831
( playing fanfare )

02:14.901 --> 02:17.302
All hail
the Grand Queen!

02:18.605 --> 02:19.805
Mother.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.406
May I help you?

02:21.408 --> 02:22.841
Thank you, Roland dear.

02:24.577 --> 02:28.680
Children, come give
your grandmother a hug.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.284
What brings you
to the castle, Your Majesty?

02:32.286 --> 02:34.853
Oh, call me Mum.

02:34.855 --> 02:38.090
I've come to see
my wonderful family,

02:38.092 --> 02:43.095
and also, Count Barnstorm's
Flying Starwing Horse Show!

02:43.097 --> 02:45.430
They're coming
to Enchancia!

02:45.432 --> 02:47.599
Flying horse show?
Brilliant.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.468
Brilliant indeed.

02:49.470 --> 02:53.105
I have seen every stop
of their world tour.

02:53.107 --> 02:55.874
I didn't know you liked
traveling horse shows, Mother.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.676
Well, then I guess
there must be

02:57.678 --> 03:00.646
a few things
you don't know about me.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.614
MINIMUS:
Sofia? Sofia!

03:02.616 --> 03:04.783
Um, I'll be
right back.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.451
Minimus,
are you okay?

03:06.453 --> 03:09.321
♪ Starwings are coming,
Starwings are coming ♪

03:09.323 --> 03:10.522
♪ The Starwings
are coming! ♪

03:10.524 --> 03:11.790
You've heard of them?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.692
Yes, I've heard of them.
They're my parents!

03:13.694 --> 03:14.693
What?

03:14.695 --> 03:16.828
My mom and dad
are the stars of the show.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.731
I had no idea
your parents
were stunt horses.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.500
Well, they
weren't always.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.168
After my brother
Mazzimo left home,

03:23.170 --> 03:25.337
Mom and Dad took up
stunt flying as a hobby.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.172
- Really?
- Yep.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.840
They were so good,
our stable master Barnstorm

03:28.842 --> 03:30.375
started a whole show
around them.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.311
You must be so excited
to see them.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.079
I'm excited
to meet them.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.480
I think
you're about to.

03:35.482 --> 03:37.449
Here they come.
Here they come!

03:41.988 --> 03:44.489
( playing fanfare )

03:46.059 --> 03:49.428
Behold, one and all,
Count Barnstorm's

03:49.430 --> 03:51.697
Fantastic Flying
Starwing Horse Show

03:51.699 --> 03:53.265
has arrived!

03:53.267 --> 03:56.335
Oh, look, that's my mom
Gemina right there.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.536
I think I see her.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.538
Yep, and my dad Argus

03:59.540 --> 04:00.706
is the one
in the back there.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.407
Brace yourself,
Enchancia,

04:02.409 --> 04:04.376
because we are
going to put on

04:04.378 --> 04:06.445
the greatest show
you'll ever see!

04:06.447 --> 04:07.746
But that's not all.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.748
After our show,
we're going to hold

04:09.750 --> 04:12.618
our first-ever amateur contest
for would-be stunt flyers.

04:12.620 --> 04:16.188
The winner will get
their very own Starwing pin.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.389
Ooh!

04:17.391 --> 04:19.191
You heard me right.

04:19.193 --> 04:21.560
There will be
two shows in one.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.328
This Sunday!

04:24.897 --> 04:26.398
Come on,
let's go up.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.001
I wanna show my mom
how high and fast I can fly now.

04:32.805 --> 04:35.474
Mom!
Dad! Wait up.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.577
Minikins!

04:38.579 --> 04:41.546
Mom! Hey, hi.
Did you see how fast
I was going?

04:41.548 --> 04:42.914
Yes, I did.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.450
And it almost made me
keel over in midair.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.252
You're going to hurt
yourself flying like that,

04:47.254 --> 04:48.420
my little puppy.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.589
( chuckling )
How's my boy?

04:50.591 --> 04:52.824
Worrying his poor
mother, that's how.

04:52.826 --> 04:56.395
Is this the princess
we've heard so much about?

04:56.397 --> 04:59.398
Mom, Dad,
this is Sofia.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.800
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.402
It's good
to meet you, too.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.671
Thank you for taking
such great care

05:05.673 --> 05:07.439
of my Minikins.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.074
But please, Sofia,

05:09.076 --> 05:11.443
you can't let him
fly so recklessly.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.779
Mini, you're not
built for speed
or heights.

05:13.781 --> 05:17.015
- Tell him, Argus.
- Yes, dear.
What your mother said.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.918
All this hovering
must be difficult
for you, Mini.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.520
Let's
get you down.

05:23.423 --> 05:26.992
Mom, you don't have to make
such a fuss over me anymore.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.594
I've grown up a lot
since I left home.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.596
I'm a Flying
Derby Horse now.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.632
Minimus, you know
you shouldn't talk

05:33.634 --> 05:35.367
and land at
the same time.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.436
He's a great
Derby Horse, Mrs. Gemina.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.371
We won a dozen races
together.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.173
Mom, it's true.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.275
We even won
the Flying Derby championship!

05:43.277 --> 05:45.444
Flying Derby?
I haven't heard of it.

05:45.446 --> 05:48.447
But I hope
it's a nice, safe sport.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.848
( dejected sigh )

05:49.850 --> 05:51.550
( fanfare playing
in distance )

05:51.552 --> 05:53.018
That's our call.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.619
We have to practice
for the big show.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.455
We'll find you
soon, Minikins.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.390
Yes, Mom.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.492
Your father and I
have been looking forward

06:00.494 --> 06:02.794
to seeing you
this whole tour.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.296
Come along, Argus.

06:04.298 --> 06:05.664
Yes, dear.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.566
Bye, Minikins.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.368
Bye, Mom.

06:09.370 --> 06:13.038
I really hoped she'd finally
treat me differently.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.506
I'm a grown horse now!

06:14.508 --> 06:16.375
Nope, she's still
treating me like

06:16.377 --> 06:17.976
a timid little foal.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.911
She does seem
a little... concerned

06:19.913 --> 06:21.546
you might
hurt yourself.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.549
She's more than concerned.
She's convinced.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.917
Why?

06:25.919 --> 06:27.519
It all started back when

tiptoeing,

tiptoeing.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.742
AMBER:
Grandmother?

09:03.744 --> 09:05.677
Oh, hello there,
children.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.045
Just taking a stroll.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.747
Into the stables?

09:08.749 --> 09:10.749
This is the stables?

09:10.751 --> 09:12.817
Really?

09:12.819 --> 09:15.053
I thought it was
the guest house.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.488
( laughs )

09:16.490 --> 09:18.256
Well, I must've
gotten lost.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.492
Lost? You've lived
in this castle.

09:20.494 --> 09:23.428
And you're acting
really strange.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.830
What's going on?
You can tell us.

09:25.832 --> 09:29.668
Well, it would be a relief
to share my little secret.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.904
You're right.
I wasn't lost.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.174
- I was looking for
a flying horse.
- Why?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.577
Because I want to enter

09:38.579 --> 09:41.680
the amateur
Starwing contest.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.115
- You do?
- But you're
our grandmother.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.251
So true, my dear.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.520
But I have also wanted
to be a stunt flyer

09:48.522 --> 09:50.288
since I was your age.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.558
Ever since I saw
my first air show.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.761
And now,
I have the chance.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.130
I think it's
really exciting.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.299
I'm so glad
you told us.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.735
- We'll help you,
right, James?
- Sure.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.904
Oh, wonderful.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.739
Then perhaps first,
you can help me

10:07.741 --> 10:09.741
choose a suitable horse.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.476
Who might you recommend?

10:11.478 --> 10:13.278
Windfall.
He's really fast,

10:13.280 --> 10:15.313
and he'll jump over
anything.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.749
Oh, he will do nicely.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.150
Yes, you will.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.720
Now, children,
there's one more thing.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.956
I need some sort
of disguise.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.491
A disguise? Why?

10:26.493 --> 10:30.228
Well, most people
see me only one way.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.330
Especially
your father.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.899
He likes to think of me
as his proper,

10:34.901 --> 10:37.669
traditional,
boring mother.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.104
But I'm much more
than that.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.139
I like a little fun.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.141
I love a new thrill.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.142
( gasps )

10:44.144 --> 10:45.777
Perhaps, though,

10:45.779 --> 10:48.446
it's best if your father
doesn't see that.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.915
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, I do.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.485
And I can do better
than a disguise, Grandmother.

10:53.487 --> 10:56.955
How about a whole
stunt flying costume?

10:56.957 --> 10:59.824
Oh, sounds divine.

11:10.636 --> 11:13.171
Okay, I think
the Starwings are done
practicing for today,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.306
so we should have
the arena all to ourselves.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.841
Hey, whatcha
doin', bro?

11:16.843 --> 11:18.810
Mazzimo, what are
you doing here?

11:18.812 --> 11:20.612
- Hi, Mazz.
- Hey, Sofia.

11:20.614 --> 11:22.147
Are you here to see
your parents' show?

11:22.149 --> 11:24.849
Yep. It's the only thing
I ever leave the valley for.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.185
Well, you might see me,
too, then.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.954
Sofia and I were just about
to start practicing our routine

11:29.956 --> 11:31.890
for the Starwing
Amateur Contest.

11:31.892 --> 11:35.226
- Maybe you've heard of it.
- Whoa! Go on.
Show me what you got.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.395
All right, well,
any good stunt routine

11:37.397 --> 11:38.797
has to start with
a barrel roll.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.965
Oh, starting with
a tough one.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.133
Here you go.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.270
MINIMUS: Here we go!

11:46.405 --> 11:47.639
Nice takeoff.

11:49.975 --> 11:51.142
SOFIA: Whoo!

11:56.982 --> 11:59.350
Whoa, sweet spin.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.553
Thanks. Hold on
tight, Sofia.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.021
We're gonna do
the hoops.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.756
Okay, Minimus.

12:06.092 --> 12:07.425
SOFIA: Nice!

12:07.427 --> 12:09.661
Whoa, baby bro's
gotten good.

12:12.431 --> 12:15.567
Try some
vertical.

12:15.569 --> 12:16.601
Do a firecracker.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.703
Wow. This is incredible.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.405
I'm a firecracker!

12:20.407 --> 12:22.874
GEMINA:
Minimus!

12:22.876 --> 12:24.909
You were flying so high
I could see you

12:24.911 --> 12:26.678
all the way
from our tent.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.681
Whoa! Mom, what are
you doing?

12:29.683 --> 12:33.151
Bringing you back
down to earth
where it is safe.

12:39.725 --> 12:41.693
Mini, what were
you doing up there?

12:41.695 --> 12:43.428
Mom, go easy
on him.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.963
Mazzimo!

12:44.965 --> 12:46.931
You came to see
our show.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.700
But how could you
just sit there

12:48.702 --> 12:51.269
and let your brother
try a dangerous stunt like that?

12:51.271 --> 12:54.973
Minimus, what in the world
were you doing flying so high?

12:54.975 --> 12:57.375
Sofia and I are practicing...

12:57.377 --> 12:59.077
for the amateur contest.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.279
Mrs. Gemina,
he's really good
at this.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.882
Sweetheart,
you're adorable,

13:03.884 --> 13:05.316
but this is
a family matter.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.085
Did you know about this?

13:07.087 --> 13:09.888
Yes, I did, and I'm
proud of him for trying.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.056
No. It is too dangerous.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.259
I forbid you to enter
that competition.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.661
- Mom!
- Remember what happened

13:16.663 --> 13:18.563
last time you tried
a flying stunt?

13:18.565 --> 13:20.732
Yes, Mother.

13:20.734 --> 13:23.301
I don't want you
to ever get hurt
like that again.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.904
I want what's best
for you, Mini--

13:25.906 --> 13:28.439
the easy life
of a stable horse.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.475
I know.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.310
So you agree you're
done with this foolishness?

13:32.312 --> 13:33.912
Yes, Mother.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.980
That's my baby boy.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.715
So good to your mother.

13:39.919 --> 13:43.021
Oh, boy, you're still
letting her treat you
like a little foal.

13:43.023 --> 13:46.791
Maybe I am better off
just being a stable horse.

13:46.793 --> 13:51.029
Hey, don't let anyone tell you
what you can or cannot be.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.764
If you wanna
fly stunts,

13:52.766 --> 13:54.265
fly stunts.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.867
Mazz is right,
Minimus.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.269
You're a new horse
now, remember?

13:58.271 --> 13:59.838
You know what?

13:59.840 --> 14:01.139
You're right.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.775
Okay, let's get
back to practice.

14:03.777 --> 14:05.310
Yes!

14:05.312 --> 14:07.178
Oh, Grandmum,

14:07.180 --> 14:09.647
you look
fabulous!

14:09.649 --> 14:11.549
Now let's get
to the show.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.084
( laughing )

14:26.832 --> 14:28.833
I can't believe
my mother enjoys

14:28.835 --> 14:30.568
watching this kind
of thing.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.407
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:36.409 --> 14:38.009
it is time.

14:38.011 --> 14:41.212
Count Barnstorm's
Flying Starwing Horse Show

14:41.214 --> 14:42.914
is about to begin.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.186
Sorry we're late.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.420
Is Grandmum
with you?

14:49.422 --> 14:51.823
- Who?
- Your grandmother?

14:51.825 --> 14:53.758
Oh, Grandmother.
Right.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.727
No, no, she's not.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.496
We have absolutely
no idea where she is.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.366
But she was looking
forward to the show
more than anyone.

15:01.368 --> 15:05.069
Hello,
my lovely family.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.573
( whispers )
Your riding gloves.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.209
What were those?

15:11.211 --> 15:13.111
What were what?
I didn't see anything.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.579
Did I miss much?

15:25.057 --> 15:27.225
Boy, they are
really good.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.593
You're really
good, too.

15:59.892 --> 16:03.261
What a show.
What a show!

16:03.263 --> 16:06.564
And now, if anyone out there
is daring enough to fly

16:06.566 --> 16:08.099
in the very same arena

16:08.101 --> 16:10.268
as the fantastic
Flying Starwings,

16:10.270 --> 16:11.769
come, line up.

16:11.771 --> 16:15.273
It's time for
our amateur contest!

16:15.275 --> 16:17.275
Excuse me a moment.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.309
Where are you going?

16:18.311 --> 16:21.112
I'm going to, um,
change.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.381
Change? Into what?

16:28.654 --> 16:31.189
Here we go.
It's now or never, bro.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.591
Minimus, remember.
In every derby race,

16:33.593 --> 16:35.126
and on every adventure
we've been on,

16:35.128 --> 16:37.295
you always end up doing
so much more

16:37.297 --> 16:38.763
than you think you can.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.631
I know, and I know.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.867
Okay, I...
I can do this.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.268
Let's go.

16:50.275 --> 16:52.276
Hi, sweet boys.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.511
Did you see the show?

16:53.513 --> 16:55.046
You were great, Mom,
like always.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.848
And I'm gonna
be great, too.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.117
- What did you say?
- I know you're
against it,

16:59.119 --> 17:02.286
but I really, really
wanna enter the amateur contest.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.055
Did you put him
up to this?

17:04.057 --> 17:05.556
He's his own horse, Mom.

17:05.558 --> 17:08.326
And I'm not
the same horse I used to be.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.995
Please, let me
show you that.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.398
It's that important
to you, Mini?

17:13.400 --> 17:14.565
It is.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.235
Then you have
my support.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.237
On one condition.

17:21.006 --> 17:22.840
This is ridiculous.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.409
I feel like
a balloon animal.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.210
It's only some padding.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.046
You'll be fine.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.547
We know the routine
inside and out.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.416
We can still do this.

17:33.018 --> 17:34.185
I'm not sure
I can do this!

17:34.187 --> 17:36.521
( yelling )

17:36.523 --> 17:39.390
I'm up, I'm up!
Here we go.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.726
- SOFIA: Over here.
- Maybe Mom's right.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.228
I can't see
very much, Sofia.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.364
SOFIA: Don't give up.
Go for the hoops.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.834
Wait a second. Amateurs
aren't allowed to fly
through the rings of fire.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.170
Come on, fellas,
let's put them out.

17:57.209 --> 17:59.010
SOFIA:
I believe in you!

17:59.012 --> 18:01.345
Whoo!
Steady, Minimus.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.514
You've got this.
Just get going.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.250
We're almost there.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.225
This is a disaster.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.793
SOFIA: We've still got
one more move.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.195
The firecracker.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.397
MINIMUS:
Here we go. Whoo!

18:19.399 --> 18:22.200
Padding...
too... heavy.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.635
( both yelling )

18:35.080 --> 18:37.281
I'm so sorry,
Minimus.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.617
( sighs )
It's not your fault.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.286
It wasn't yours, either.
It was the padding.

18:46.291 --> 18:49.427
Mini, are you okay,
my little puppy?

18:49.429 --> 18:51.429
( sighs )
I'm fine, Mom.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.231
I just, um...

18:53.233 --> 18:55.032
I wanna be alone.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.238
As always,
our show delivers

19:00.240 --> 19:02.440
uncommon surprises.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.774
But let's move on.

19:03.776 --> 19:08.146
Next up, we have
a mysterious masked rider.

19:13.352 --> 19:15.319
She's amazing,
isn't she?

19:15.321 --> 19:17.188
Quite amazing.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.757
It's a shame
your grandmother's
missing this.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.761
( sighs ) Wish I could've
flown like that.

19:30.369 --> 19:32.236
- Oh, no.
- ( gasping )

19:41.446 --> 19:44.515
( Grandmother exclaiming )

19:44.517 --> 19:46.484
Here I come!

19:46.486 --> 19:48.419
( screaming )

19:52.324 --> 19:53.958
Gotcha!

19:53.960 --> 19:55.560
Go, Minimus!

19:58.964 --> 20:01.399
Mother?

20:02.501 --> 20:03.467
Minimus.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.403
You saved
my grandmother.

20:08.173 --> 20:09.507
My Minkins!

20:09.509 --> 20:12.310
Oh, you were
so daring.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.978
My boy.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.314
You are one
wild horse.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.916
Mini, I'm sorry...

20:18.918 --> 20:20.518
for the padding.

20:20.520 --> 20:23.321
You're not a little
foal anymore.
I know that.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.089
And I can't make
your choices for you.

20:25.091 --> 20:27.091
So if you want
to fly stunts,

20:27.093 --> 20:29.060
then I'll support you.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.529
In fact,
your mother and I

20:31.531 --> 20:33.898
would like it very much
if you and Sofia

20:33.900 --> 20:36.334
joined us for
the Starwing encore.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.935
You really mean it?

20:37.937 --> 20:40.104
Wait, are there
conditions, Mom?

20:40.106 --> 20:42.039
No conditions.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.507
Then I'd love to.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.376
And how about
you, Mazzi?

20:45.378 --> 20:47.912
So I can have
both my boys together.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.447
Yeah. Why not?

20:49.449 --> 20:51.849
Wait. There's someone else
who should get a chance

20:51.851 --> 20:53.618
to fly again, too.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.685
My grandmother.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.287
Tiptoeing,
tiptoeing.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.723
Tiptoeing,
tiptoeing...

20:58.725 --> 21:00.758
Why didn't you
tell me the truth, Mother?

21:00.760 --> 21:04.362
Oh, I was afraid you couldn't
handle the truth, Roland.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.864
I must admit,
I'm a little shocked.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.599
You fell off your horse.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.368
( giggles )
Yes, it's true.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.536
That was not
my intention, however.

21:12.538 --> 21:16.040
But it was
quite exciting,
don't you agree?

21:16.042 --> 21:18.743
We have yet another
surprise for you, Enchancia.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.711
It has come to
my attention

21:20.713 --> 21:24.048
that the masked rider...
the Grand Queen...

21:24.050 --> 21:26.317
only fell because
a rope tore

21:26.319 --> 21:28.252
during the previous
contestant's routine.

21:28.254 --> 21:31.055
Therefore, she will get
a second chance

21:31.057 --> 21:32.823
to show off
her stunt flying

21:32.825 --> 21:35.593
by joining the Starwings
in their encore!

21:35.595 --> 21:38.129
Oh! How wonderful!

21:50.409 --> 21:52.243
BOTH:
Go, Grandmother!

22:05.424 --> 22:08.426
My mother
the stunt flyer.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.861
Hm. I guess it is
kind of exciting.

22:10.863 --> 22:14.098
Brava, Mother!
Brava!

22:17.969 --> 22:20.638
Minimus,
you're a stunt horse now.

22:20.640 --> 22:24.008
No, I'm not.
I'm not just a stunt horse.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.478
I'm a stunt horse
and a stable horse.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.313
And a Derby champ.

22:29.315 --> 22:30.848
And adventurer.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.250
And a firecracker!
