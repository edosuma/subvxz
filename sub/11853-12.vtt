Good morning, Mr. Grouper!

03:49.462 --> 03:51.664
Well, good morning, everyone!

03:51.731 --> 03:54.000
Mr. Grouper,
we saw an orchestra!

03:54.067 --> 03:55.635
Oh, wow!

03:55.702 --> 03:58.471
Mr. Grouper,
what's an orchestra?

03:58.538 --> 04:01.307
An orchestra is
a big group of musicians

04:01.374 --> 04:03.276
that play music together.

04:03.343 --> 04:04.777
That's right, Nonny.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.713
Orchestras make
beautiful music

04:06.779 --> 04:09.549
with all sorts
of different instruments!

04:09.616 --> 04:11.284
I like the flute!

04:11.351 --> 04:13.486
(Mimicking flute sounds)

04:13.553 --> 04:15.355
I like the violin.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.524
(Mimicking violin sounds)

04:18.591 --> 04:21.361
I like the trumpet
because it's loud!

04:21.427 --> 04:23.463
(Mimicking trumpet sounds)

04:23.529 --> 04:25.565
(All chuckling)

04:25.632 --> 04:28.968
Mr. Grouper, what other
instruments are in an orchestra?

04:29.035 --> 04:31.070
Let's think about it!

04:31.137 --> 04:35.908
A shiny brass instrument that
you blow into is called the...

04:35.975 --> 04:38.845
(Horn sounding)

04:40.179 --> 04:42.181
Trumpet!

04:42.248 --> 04:43.883
That's right!

04:43.950 --> 04:45.618
And the long instrument

04:45.685 --> 04:48.655
with lots of holes along
the side is called the...

04:48.721 --> 04:53.092
(Instrument sounding)

04:54.761 --> 04:56.062
Flute!

04:56.129 --> 04:57.597
Right! The flute!

04:57.664 --> 04:59.265
And there's
a string instrument

04:59.332 --> 05:01.601
that you play
with a bow called the...

05:01.668 --> 05:05.304
(Instrument sounding)

05:06.906 --> 05:08.808
Violin.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.209
That's right!

05:10.276 --> 05:11.911
There's also the piano...

05:11.978 --> 05:14.347
(Piano sounding)

05:14.414 --> 05:15.882
...the French horn...

05:15.948 --> 05:17.817
(Horn sounding)

05:17.884 --> 05:19.752
...and the tympani!

05:19.819 --> 05:21.854
(Drums sounding)

05:21.921 --> 05:24.190
These are just some
of the many instruments

08:31.210 --> 08:32.712
Great choice!

08:32.778 --> 08:36.616
Those percussion instruments
are called the tympani.

it comes on wheels!

I got a veggie sandwich
and apple juice with a straw!

09:16.155 --> 09:18.658
What did you get, Nonny?

09:18.724 --> 09:21.394

09:32.939 --> 09:34.774
(Laughing)

09:34.840 --> 09:36.475
In an orchestra,

09:36.542 --> 09:39.111
people who play similar
instruments sit together.

09:39.178 --> 09:41.080
It's called a "section."

09:41.147 --> 09:42.982
(Strings playing)

09:43.049 --> 09:44.183
Hi, Gil.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.551
Hey, Molly.

09:45.618 --> 09:47.520
Check out my strings section.

09:47.586 --> 09:50.957
We have a violin,
a cello, and a bass.

09:51.023 --> 09:52.391
Listen!

09:52.458 --> 09:53.726
(Strings playing)

09:53.793 --> 09:56.996
Now finish with
"boom, boom!"

09:57.063 --> 09:58.965

09:59.031 --> 10:00.733
Not exactly.

10:05.705 --> 10:09.709
Hmmm... I just can't
make it sound right.

10:09.775 --> 10:13.012
Well, you only have
string instruments, Gilly.

10:13.079 --> 10:17.116
Yeah! Maybe I need
a percussion instrument.

10:17.183 --> 10:18.784
I just want it to go--

10:18.851 --> 10:20.219
