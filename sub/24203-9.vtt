00:40.441 --> 00:42.443
*

01:00.361 --> 01:02.563
CHACE:
It'll ring.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.932
You don't know that.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.368
How could you possibly
know that?

01:07.401 --> 01:10.003
You don't know anything.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.709
-Sorry.
-Eh...

01:19.213 --> 01:21.182
(sighs)

01:21.215 --> 01:23.717
I've got a son.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.888
You've got a son?

01:27.921 --> 01:30.291
Jesus, Chace.

01:30.324 --> 01:33.093
All this time?

01:33.127 --> 01:34.495
How old is he?

01:34.528 --> 01:35.863
About 12.

01:35.896 --> 01:39.500
You've got a 12-year-old son,
and you...

01:39.533 --> 01:41.101
Why didn't you tell me?

01:41.135 --> 01:43.337
This is about your son,
not mine.

01:43.371 --> 01:44.938
Bullshit,

01:44.972 --> 01:46.974
Fletcher, that's bullshit.

01:47.007 --> 01:50.244
All this time,
you've known the pain in here?

01:50.278 --> 01:51.479
And you've said nothing?

01:51.512 --> 01:53.947
I was ashamed.

01:53.981 --> 01:55.048
Of your son?

01:55.082 --> 01:57.117
No.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.153
Of me.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.930
("Oh Nero Nero"
by Cosimo Monteleone playing)

02:09.963 --> 02:11.965
(man singing in Italian)

02:38.826 --> 02:40.027
(grunts)

02:44.031 --> 02:46.033
(engine running)

03:04.385 --> 03:06.387
(heart beating)

03:41.722 --> 03:42.923
(quietly):
Hey.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.158
Yeah.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.599
(horn honking)

04:25.633 --> 04:28.636
(shouting)

04:45.486 --> 04:48.422

*

05:46.246 --> 05:48.215
(gasps)

05:48.248 --> 05:50.718
NEWSCASTER (over radio):
...President Nixon has ordered

05:50.751 --> 05:53.186
the attorney general,
Elliot Richardson,

05:53.220 --> 05:56.690
to fire special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox,

05:56.724 --> 06:00.027
after Cox announced that
he'll continue his court battle

06:00.060 --> 06:03.296
to hear the presidential tapes
in the Watergate case.

06:03.330 --> 06:04.364
President Nixon's attorney...

06:04.398 --> 06:06.767
(doorbell buzzes)

06:06.800 --> 06:08.368
(bowl clatters)

06:08.402 --> 06:10.237
NEWSCASTER: ...arguing
that the Constitution...

06:13.574 --> 06:15.543
Chace?

06:15.576 --> 06:17.044
What?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.311
It's not the worst,

06:18.345 --> 06:20.848
but it's not good.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.251
GIORDANO: We have no proof
this is Paul's ear.

06:24.284 --> 06:28.221
These are Paul's freckles.

06:28.255 --> 06:31.859
Lots of people have freckles.

06:31.892 --> 06:36.163
I washed his hair as a baby,

06:36.196 --> 06:39.166
kissed him
when he went to sleep at night,

06:39.199 --> 06:43.003
kissed him in the morning,

06:43.036 --> 06:48.408
tucked his hair behind his ears
every... when he went to school.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.744
This is my son's.

06:50.778 --> 06:55.215
Then I suggest
you pay the ransom.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.420
Can I keep these?

07:00.454 --> 07:02.289
GIORDANO:
Yes.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.774
PAUL:
Strange decision,

07:20.808 --> 07:22.610
removing an ear.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.613
It's not definitive.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.715
A finger comes with a print.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.783
Better.

07:29.817 --> 07:33.453
Perhaps they'll send
a finger next time.

07:33.487 --> 07:36.790
Maybe it's a metaphor, Paul.

07:36.824 --> 07:41.228
Maybe they're trying
to get someone to listen.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.296
-I don't follow.
-No.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.098
No, you really don't, do you?

07:45.132 --> 07:47.801
-ROBINA: Paul.
-Hmm?

07:47.835 --> 07:49.937
Gail's been waiting
quite some time now.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.405
(groans)
All right.

07:52.439 --> 07:55.142
Very impressive picture, Gail.

07:55.175 --> 07:59.079
I'm more of
a Renaissance era man, myself.

07:59.112 --> 08:02.583
Well, there were certainly
many instances of mutilation

08:02.616 --> 08:07.821
in those pictures,
now that I think about it.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.823
Hello, Paul.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.959
Hello, Gail.

08:13.360 --> 08:17.798
Are you sure that the ear
belongs to Paul?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.267
I couldn't be more certain.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.170
Whatever the rights and wrongs

08:23.203 --> 08:26.006
of his behavior, sir,

08:26.039 --> 08:28.976
he's your grandson.

08:29.009 --> 08:33.614
They're sending him
back in pieces.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.218
I implore you.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.954
Please.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.355
Help him.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.692
I have attempted
to resolve this situation

08:44.725 --> 08:47.861
on a number of instances.

08:47.895 --> 08:52.600
I went to Italy, and put myself
at considerable risk,

08:52.633 --> 08:56.036
so that I could negotiate
a very fair deal

08:56.069 --> 09:00.340
that the boy's father
refused to accept.

09:00.373 --> 09:04.912
There's really nothing else
that I can do.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.583
The key to resolving
this situation

09:09.617 --> 09:11.752
lies with your ex-husband.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.456
And you tell him

09:16.489 --> 09:20.327
that he should
come to his senses.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.620
*

10:15.816 --> 10:17.084
Where's the head gardener?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.786
That's me, mate.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.788
As of today.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.923
The other bloke did
a moonlight flit.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.230
Gail's waiting downstairs.

10:30.263 --> 10:33.633
It-it doesn't even look
like a human ear.

10:33.667 --> 10:37.437
Gail wouldn't know an ear
from a piece of prosciutto.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.339
Honestly, Paul,
that's a vile thing to say.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.408
Well, she wouldn't.

10:46.880 --> 10:51.284
Remember when he dressed up
as Jesus?

10:51.318 --> 10:55.989
One of the photos they took
was a close-up of his face.

10:56.023 --> 10:59.993
We matched the ear to that.

11:00.027 --> 11:04.297
It's not a piece of prosciutto.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.700
VICTORIA:
Well, I'll leave you to it.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.846
He made a beautiful Jesus,
didn't he?

11:18.879 --> 11:20.848
Yeah.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.515
(Gail laughs softly)

11:22.549 --> 11:23.884
Huh.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.219
You look, uh...

11:26.253 --> 11:27.620
(laughs softly)

11:27.654 --> 11:30.357
It's, uh, it's good to see you.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.359
It's good to see you, too.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.693
(exhales)

11:33.727 --> 11:35.362
It's been a long time.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.397
Yeah.

11:46.639 --> 11:49.409
(exhales)

11:53.246 --> 11:55.382
Please, accept
your father's loan.

11:55.415 --> 12:00.387
See, that's-that's the problem
exactly, it's a loan.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.390
Now, he's offering to lend me
my money from the trust

12:03.423 --> 12:04.825
at-at four percent
above the base.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.626
My own money.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.396
He stands to make a profit--
the bastard stands to profit

12:09.429 --> 12:11.164
off the kidnapping of our son.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.400
I know.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.069
But how much more of him
do you want to see hacked off

12:16.103 --> 12:18.071
and put in the post?

12:18.105 --> 12:19.639
(sighs)

12:19.672 --> 12:22.242
Please.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.911
Put your name
on a piece of paper...

12:23.944 --> 12:27.014
No! No, no, no. I can't.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.748
-Sign the damn thing.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:28.782 --> 12:29.749
-Please.
-I can't.

12:29.783 --> 12:30.918
You don't understand.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.253
If I sign, then he has got me.

12:33.286 --> 12:37.024
I mean, don't you remember
the phone calls day and night?

12:37.057 --> 12:39.927
The visits,
the-the repayment schedule,

12:39.960 --> 12:43.964
the bullying that slowly, slowly
sucks the life out of you

12:43.997 --> 12:46.934
until you are in a garage
at a party, stabbing yourself

12:46.967 --> 12:49.269
to death in the chest
with a barbecue fork.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.271
It killed George.
It-It killed him.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.273
And I-I can't do it,
it'll kill me.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.108
It's our son who will
be killed, Paul.

12:55.142 --> 12:58.245
I can't-- I can't do it.

13:27.540 --> 13:31.111
ANNENBERG: Of course any
assistance that I can give,

13:31.144 --> 13:33.280
but I'm sure you've seen
the news.

13:33.313 --> 13:37.150
President Nixon has a lot
on his plate right now.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.818
GAIL:
I can appreciate that.

13:38.852 --> 13:42.122
Do you have children,
Ambassador Annenberg?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.123
ANNENBERG:
A daughter.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.492
Forgive me...

13:45.525 --> 13:48.128
you had a son.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.164
I did. Yes.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.699
He died.

13:54.301 --> 13:58.005
Around the time that
I first met your father.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.507
And is that why you came to me?

14:00.540 --> 14:04.544
Because you thought
you had an angle.

14:04.577 --> 14:05.979
Yes.

14:06.013 --> 14:11.018
I've run out of options, sir.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.986
You know what it's like
to lose a son.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.188
I'm losing mine.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.524
Every day,
he's slipping away from me.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.227
I feel it, sir.
I feel it in my bones.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.799
ANNENBERG:
All right.

14:28.235 --> 14:32.906
Mr. President, as a mother,

14:32.940 --> 14:35.075
I am begging you to--

14:36.910 --> 14:39.579
(shivering, coughs)

14:46.920 --> 14:48.188
GAIL:
I am appealing to you

14:48.221 --> 14:51.891
with all my heart.

14:51.925 --> 14:56.496
My son is in great danger...

14:56.529 --> 14:57.931
(scratching out sentence)

15:06.606 --> 15:08.441
You are my last hope.

15:09.876 --> 15:10.877
Please help me.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.923
GAIL: Please, God,
let these be the right words.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.628
Thank you.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.434
NIXON (on TV):
Because people have got to know

15:34.467 --> 15:36.069
whether or not
their President's a crook.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.604
Well, I'm not a crook.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.606
I've earned everything I've got.

15:39.639 --> 15:40.974
(sighs)

15:42.242 --> 15:44.444
A fax for you, Mr. President.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.779
What are they throwing
at me now?

15:46.813 --> 15:52.252
GAIL: I'm appealing to you as
a citizen of the United States.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.620
NIXON:
When do they not?

15:53.653 --> 15:55.088
GAIL:
I have no more options.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.790
As a citizen,
one is supposed to be able

15:57.824 --> 16:00.127
to appeal to their president.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.961
As a friend of my
father-in-law,

16:01.995 --> 16:03.530
Mr. John Paul Getty,

16:03.563 --> 16:08.968
and as a human being,
please help.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.403
I don't know what else to do.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.920
What's wrong with the man?

16:27.954 --> 16:32.759
I don't know.
Something's very wrong.

16:32.792 --> 16:36.329
And at what point does one say
"That's enough"?

16:36.363 --> 16:38.598
-Patrick, don't.
-Just a question.

16:38.631 --> 16:42.335
If an ear turned up in my post,
I'd bloody well pay up.

16:42.369 --> 16:45.338
I know you would.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.240
Look, I'm no billionaire.

16:47.274 --> 16:48.508
The only things I own
in the world are

16:48.541 --> 16:50.009
a biplane with an oil leak

16:50.043 --> 16:53.180
and a house with dicky plumbing.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.282
I can't even guarantee you
a hot bath.

16:55.315 --> 16:58.351
-Patrick, please don't.
-But I love you.

16:58.385 --> 17:01.121
Only you.
And the dog.

17:01.154 --> 17:05.492
With all my heart, Penelope.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.228
Come and live with me.
Please.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.868
Please.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.904
(door opens)

17:20.507 --> 17:24.544
PAUL:
This had better be good.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.978
I regret I am unable
to say, sir.

17:26.012 --> 17:28.881
I've about had it with
your regrets, Bullimore.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.884
Who the fuck is it?

17:31.918 --> 17:35.422
The President of the United
States of America, sir.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.725
Oh.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.428
Mr. President.

17:41.461 --> 17:42.895
NIXON: I hear you have
a problem in...

17:42.929 --> 17:45.565
-Wyoming.
-Indians.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.067
Of the red variety, sir.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.937
Getting in the way
of my drilling.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.605
NIXON:
Expensive?

17:52.639 --> 17:55.742
(scoffs)
It's costing me millions.

17:55.775 --> 17:59.078
Well, the cavalry just arrived.

17:59.112 --> 18:02.081
Is this an offer of help,
Mr. President?

18:02.115 --> 18:04.251
NIXON:
Maybe.

18:04.284 --> 18:08.521
Let's just talk about this
grandson of yours first.

18:08.555 --> 18:12.559
(Dante whistles)

18:16.363 --> 18:18.398
Ho.

18:25.238 --> 18:28.040
Ho!
(whistles)

18:28.074 --> 18:29.041
Ho.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.978
(shivering)

18:51.063 --> 18:54.567
I believe an apology is
in order.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.936
Well, I don't think that I have
anything to apologize for.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.472
Not from you.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.507
From me.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.512
I was wrong.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.149
You were wrong?

19:10.183 --> 19:12.752
It does happen.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.421
I propose a compromise.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.323
Wha-- A compromise?

19:16.356 --> 19:19.426
Paul! You continue

19:19.459 --> 19:22.529
to repeat everything that I say.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.165
(sighs)

19:26.199 --> 19:30.337
Yes. I will pay

19:30.370 --> 19:32.505
half the ransom personally.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.106
Personally?

19:34.140 --> 19:35.308
I'm sorry.

19:35.342 --> 19:38.945
My own money.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.180
And... the other half?

19:41.214 --> 19:43.149
A loan from the trust.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.518
Oh, well,
we have been here before.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.487
Interest-free.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.396
PAUL JR.:
Well...

19:59.566 --> 20:00.900
(strained chuckle)

20:07.173 --> 20:10.042
(Paul Jr. sighs)

20:10.076 --> 20:12.645
I see.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.448
We have a deal?

20:18.585 --> 20:21.488
Yes, yes, I, uh--
I-I think we do.

20:23.089 --> 20:24.223
Penelope.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.525
(sighs)

20:37.904 --> 20:40.407
Be anything else, or...?

20:40.440 --> 20:41.774
Let Gail know.

20:47.280 --> 20:51.183
How many millions will you make
from your Nixon deal?

20:51.217 --> 20:55.888
Considerably more
than I loaned my son.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.758
Extraordinary.

20:58.791 --> 21:04.030
He made no attempt
to negotiate at all.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.698
The boy has learned nothing.

21:05.732 --> 21:10.403
But I have.
Finally.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.204
I couldn't leave until I knew
Little Paul was

21:12.238 --> 21:13.773
going to be all right.

21:13.806 --> 21:17.477
But now he is.
I can say good-bye.

21:21.714 --> 21:25.084
Good-bye, Paul.
And good luck.

21:47.840 --> 21:52.645
Tell Fifty the money's coming.
It'll be here in two days.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.847
Do you understand?

21:57.984 --> 22:01.320
At least do me the courtesy
of a yes or a no.

22:01.354 --> 22:03.623
Yes.

22:03.656 --> 22:07.026
And tell the mutilating bastard
to leave my son alone.

23:43.790 --> 23:48.194
It's not too late.
You could still get rid.

23:48.227 --> 23:52.098
If I have to choose between
my baby and him,

23:52.131 --> 23:53.432
it's not much of a contest.

23:53.466 --> 23:55.935
But it's not just him,
is it, darling?

23:55.968 --> 23:58.270
It's all this, it's us.

23:58.304 --> 24:01.273
We have fun, don't we?

24:01.307 --> 24:03.309
We did.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.788
Thank you, Bullimore.

24:18.991 --> 24:22.261
BELINDA:
Kensington, please.

24:27.934 --> 24:30.770
PAUL: There goes another one,
Bullimore.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.104
Indeed, sir.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.906
PAUL:
Breach of contract.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.377
You see?

24:38.410 --> 24:40.780
Will there be anything else,
sir?

24:40.813 --> 24:44.551
No, nothing.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.807
FIFTY:
You have to drive a white car.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.513
That's a white car.

28:02.681 --> 28:07.353
No marked bills
and no invisible ink.

Five minutes.
Five minutes is all.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.072
Sure, five minutes.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.741
I just want to see
the sun, that's all.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.912
-Hey
-Yeah?

29:39.946 --> 29:42.581
I'm sorry.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.584
-Your ear.
-What? No need to apologize.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.653
No, no. My son...

29:49.889 --> 29:53.192
-It was a bad thing.
-Francesco?

29:53.225 --> 29:56.228
-He's your son?
-Yes.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.730
(softly):
Oh, shit.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.572
I asked him to do that.

30:06.605 --> 30:09.141
To cut your ear?

30:09.175 --> 30:12.511
Yeah, I begged him, man.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.982
I-I thought it was, you know,

30:16.015 --> 30:19.251
it's-it's the only way
to make my family pay attention.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.789
It's all good, really.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.827
Don't blame him.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.019
They said to keep going
until stones hit the car.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.186
What if they miss us?

30:54.220 --> 30:56.222
Then they miss out
on $5 million,

30:56.255 --> 30:57.689
and that ain't gonna happen,
trust me.

30:57.723 --> 30:59.959
How are we for gas?

30:59.992 --> 31:01.727

Not so good.

Easy, easy, easy. Cut the shit.

-Where's the kid?

Where's the Getty boy?

34:00.839 --> 34:03.375
Let me explain to you
how this is gonna work.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.477
No kid, no money.

he is when we have the money.

We will not release the boy
without the money, understand?

34:26.432 --> 34:29.067
That's not what we agreed!

34:29.101 --> 34:30.736
You know that!

34:30.769 --> 34:32.671
But this is what is happening.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.573
Paul is not here, okay?

34:34.606 --> 34:38.076
How do I know you won't
cut his other ear off?

34:38.110 --> 34:40.078
Or slit his throat?

34:40.112 --> 34:43.081
Or set him on fire?

34:43.115 --> 34:46.452
If I give you the money,
what keeps you from doing that?

35:00.966 --> 35:03.202
This is me. My face.

You don't get the boy alive,
