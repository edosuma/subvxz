00:01.126 --> 00:02.711
PETER: <i>Previously on</i> White Collar...

00:02.794 --> 00:05.923
Pink Panthers, the most dangerous
gang of thieves in the world.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.841
<i>Neal plans to infiltrate the gang.</i>

00:08.091 --> 00:09.593
They promised you freedom before,

00:09.676 --> 00:11.720
<i>what makes you think</i>
<i>this time they'll deliver?</i>

00:12.804 --> 00:14.306
Who says that's all I'm after?

00:14.598 --> 00:16.350
NEAL: How long have you
been working for Interpol?

00:16.433 --> 00:17.684
KELLER: How did you know
I was working for them?

00:18.143 --> 00:21.813
They insert chips under the skin
of their informants, like dogs.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.815
It's hard enough
putting the bad guys in prison

00:23.899 --> 00:26.401
-without the good guys letting them out.
-Luc Renault.

00:26.485 --> 00:29.488
I will do whatever is necessary
to bring down the Panthers.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.824
Aw, look at this. One big happy family.

00:33.283 --> 00:36.912
This can either be
a joint FBI and Interpol case

00:36.995 --> 00:38.705
or just FBI. Your choice.

00:38.997 --> 00:42.084
The Panthers, Neal, they don't stop
looking for rats until they're dead.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.086
Until then, guess who they go after.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.712
People closest to you.

00:45.921 --> 00:48.841
You've told them about
my extensive contributions, haven't you?

00:49.091 --> 00:50.425
You know how much I appreciate it.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.886
Not enough to mention me
to your new friends.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.388
The Panthers aren't my friends.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.848
They're going after cash.

00:55.931 --> 00:57.099
DIANA: And not just any cash.

00:57.182 --> 01:00.435
Each shipment contains
as much as $500 million.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.356
NEAL: Woodford.

01:04.439 --> 01:05.816
There's a small problem.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.945
It seems there's a mole in the operation.

01:11.697 --> 01:12.739
A mole?

01:16.535 --> 01:18.078
That's a serious problem.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.038
It's a catastrophic one.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.583
He could bring down this operation.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.960
Cost me the rest of my life in prison.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.712
Why tell me?

01:29.882 --> 01:32.634
You are the only one I'm sure
isn't the mole.

01:33.552 --> 01:36.096
I discovered a listening device
in one of my hideouts

01:36.180 --> 01:37.556
before you joined us.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.435
It's the reason I've kept
the plan close to my vest.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.689
I came here to ask a favor.

01:46.481 --> 01:47.816
Anything.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.819
Dig up the mole.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.572
Anything but that.

01:53.989 --> 01:56.658
The only thing worse than a mole is a rat.

01:58.410 --> 02:01.788
I've never been one, and I never will be.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.128
That just might be
a better answer than, "Yes."

02:11.673 --> 02:14.676
Now I know there's someone
I can trust completely.

02:15.344 --> 02:16.345
(CLICKS TONGUE)

02:25.187 --> 02:27.272
I'll find the traitor myself.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.943
What if you can't?

02:32.569 --> 02:34.071
I'll put the plan to bed.

02:34.363 --> 02:35.864
Go underground for a while.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.950
What, you'd just walk away?

02:38.033 --> 02:41.578
Nothing's worth spending the rest
of one's life incarcerated.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.623
Not even half a billion in cash.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.167
Half a billion? (LAUGHS)

02:49.419 --> 02:51.964
What are you planning to hit,
the Federal Reserve?

03:07.020 --> 03:08.355
What's all that?

03:08.438 --> 03:09.857
Research.

03:09.940 --> 03:13.110
Background checks,
eyewitness testimonies.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.029
-Mmm, Oh. Looks serious.
-Extremely.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.073
I've narrowed it down to these five.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.284
ELIZABETH: Why are they
all in white coats?

03:20.409 --> 03:21.869
They're obstetricians.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.580
And from what I've uncovered,
the finest in New York.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.373
You should be safe with any of them.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.751
Honey, you do know that
I already have an OBGYN, right?

03:30.294 --> 03:31.587
-You do?
-Mmm-hmm.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.964
-Is he any one of them?
-She's right here.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.009
PETER: I did a background check on her?

03:37.092 --> 03:38.510
-Ten years ago.
-I did?

03:38.594 --> 03:39.636
Yeah.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.098
You need to stop worrying.
My pregnancy is not a case.

03:43.599 --> 03:46.768
What if I gave the baby
a tiny little anklet?

03:46.852 --> 03:48.437
Neal's is very comforting.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.606
-No? Okay.
-No.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.860
-We're gonna get to see a sonogram.
-Yeah.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.070
-We're gonna meet our baby.
-I can't wait.

03:58.322 --> 03:59.781
What if the doctor sees something?

03:59.865 --> 04:01.575
-Then we know it's a boy.
-That's not what I meant.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.118
I know it's not what you meant.

04:03.619 --> 04:06.330
Honey, listen. Our baby is fine.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.790
We've waited so long for this.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.667
Can't you just enjoy it?

04:12.836 --> 04:14.171
I'm loving every minute.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.506
Good.

04:22.054 --> 04:24.097
Yeah, so I've dodged
the mole hunt for now.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.391
That's why the Panthers were laying low.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.519
It had nothing to do with San Francisco.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.271
If Woodford doesn't get his moles,
the operation's finished.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.941
Uh, "Mole," singular. Not a labor.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.234
Half and half?

04:35.317 --> 04:37.194
-I thought you switched to soy.
-I switched back.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.905
JONES: A labor?
DIANA: A group of more than one mole.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.573
Theo likes gardening shows.

04:41.657 --> 04:45.619
Woodford is looking for one,
and he has two. I like my odds.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.371
You give him Keller.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.581
Oh. Yeah,
then hang the snitch suit on him.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.458
Won't Keller talk to save his own neck?

04:51.542 --> 04:53.460
Not if Luc pulls him first.

04:53.544 --> 04:57.172
If I get Keller pulled,
you promote it that Keller ran

04:57.256 --> 04:59.925
-because Woodford was closing in.
-Mmm-hmm.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.885
Then who do you say
Keller was working for?

05:02.052 --> 05:03.387
I'll keep it a mystery.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.222
But Woodford will know
the threat's removed.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.766
Until then, I impress him with
my knowledge of the algorithm.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.060
Tell him what we taught you,
maybe he'll fill in the blanks.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.650
Did that San Francisco flight
reveal anything new?

05:17.568 --> 05:20.028
Not really. Did Woodford say anything?

05:20.404 --> 05:23.073
Got to meet him now.
Better take this to go.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.283
See you.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.742
Great.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.913
Think he knows about the cash?

05:31.206 --> 05:33.500
If he does, why isn't he telling us?

05:33.584 --> 05:36.420
Half a billion's enough to lead
anyone into temptation.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.338
Especially Caffrey.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.257
Especially off anklet.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.304
I ran a Wall Street scam last year,

05:45.929 --> 05:49.850
manipulating algorithms,
so when I printed out the Exodus file...

05:50.184 --> 05:52.394
-You knew what it was.
-And what it does.

05:52.853 --> 05:56.773
It randomly picks airports and airlines,
among other things...

05:56.940 --> 05:58.483
And those other things are?

05:58.567 --> 06:00.444
Well, for one,
after everything's selected,

06:00.527 --> 06:03.238
there's only a 12-hour window
until the money arrives.

06:03.322 --> 06:05.324
No time to travel or prepare,

06:05.407 --> 06:08.535
so you must be waiting for the money
to be playing at an airport near you.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.080
You are everything
that Keller says you are.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.415
Now let's be clear.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.792
Keller and I were competitors,

06:15.876 --> 06:19.129
adversaries for the most part,
and not what you'd call friendly now.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.715
I find friendships within gangs dangerous.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.342
So is hitting an airport.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.719
It's ambitious under any circumstances.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.013
With only hours to plan,
it's next to impossible.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.225
The Panthers have never
shied away from difficulty.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.310
So you have a way in and a way out?

06:35.604 --> 06:37.105
Follow me.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.828
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

07:09.930 --> 07:13.767
Any idea how a bug got into
one of Woodford's hideouts?

07:14.059 --> 07:17.563
Does that matter?
What is important is that it was found.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.899
Come on, Luc, we're working together.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.985
Let's at least try to be
honest with each other.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.571
You planted that bug.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.948
But not for Woodford.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.492
You were spying on your spy.

07:30.576 --> 07:32.286
If that is true, can you blame me?

07:32.369 --> 07:35.873
Yes, I can. When Neal's undercover,
I have to trust him.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.667
His life, and the operation,
depends on it.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.044
And how many times has that
proven to be a mistake?

07:41.837 --> 07:43.755
This time the mistake is yours.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.593
Woodford knows there's a mole,
and right now we have to give him one.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.053
Very nice of you to offer yours.

07:50.179 --> 07:53.182
(LAUGHS) I wasn't offering mine.

07:53.432 --> 07:54.725
No, we need to pull Keller.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.020
But with this I know
where he is at all times.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.855
You can no longer say the same
for Caffrey.

08:00.355 --> 08:03.984
Keller can turn off his RFID chip
any time he wants.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.861
Only if he is being scanned.

08:05.944 --> 08:09.573
And if he stays off for more than
15 minutes, he knows I will move in.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.909
So you know where he is,
but not what he's up to.

08:12.242 --> 08:15.162
I can count on Neal to do the right thing.
You screwed yourself.

08:15.662 --> 08:19.666
Thanks to your bug,
Woodford trusts Neal, and no one else.

08:20.751 --> 08:24.296
Now, the good news is
you still have an inside man.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.673
Neal will work for us.

08:26.798 --> 08:29.384
We're partners in this.
What's mine is yours.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.305
If we take down the Panthers,

08:34.097 --> 08:38.268
Keller will get his deal,
and you will share in the credit.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.313
Perhaps it's time for Keller to go.

08:41.897 --> 08:43.357
Pull Keller today.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.318
Before Woodford gets cold feet
and pulls up stakes.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.362
Let's take down the Panthers, Luc.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.532
You and me, together.

08:58.539 --> 08:59.665
-Peter.
-Yeah.

08:59.748 --> 09:02.167
PETER: Hey, I was just about to tell you,
I took care of the problem.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.627
Luc agreed to pull Keller.

09:03.752 --> 09:06.088
No, Keller is the least of our worries.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.674
They got guns.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.260
I'll go back with bells on.

09:11.343 --> 09:12.970
I'm safe behind bars.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.721
Fleece some guards.

09:14.805 --> 09:18.475
And, oh, man, the beautiful privileges
they smuggle in to pay off their debts.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.602
LUC: Not the reaction I was expecting.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.354
Yeah, what do you want?

09:22.938 --> 09:25.691
Look, you guys take down the Panthers,
I still get my deal, right?

09:26.942 --> 09:28.443
I'm out in what, a week or two?

09:29.111 --> 09:31.989
It's win-win.
Seriously, man, anything I can do to help.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.576
There is one thing.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.494
What?

09:37.578 --> 09:40.998
Technically, I'm still your prisoner
and you're my keeper, right?

09:41.498 --> 09:43.876
And you and I were never partners,

09:44.626 --> 09:47.504
but your success, Luc, is my success.

09:47.838 --> 09:50.424
It goes south for you,
it goes south for me.

09:51.175 --> 09:56.471
Caffrey, he has a way of making everything
go south for everyone but him.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.351
-How much firepower?
-Just shy of nuclear.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.980
(SIGHS) This can't happen at an airport.

10:05.063 --> 10:08.108
We're gonna have to bring down
the Panthers now. No other choice.

10:08.192 --> 10:10.527
For what? Conspiracy?

10:10.861 --> 10:13.989
The entire case would hinge on
the testimony of two criminal informants.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.533
I don't care. We shut it down now,

10:16.617 --> 10:18.744
whether we have enough on
the Panthers or not.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.454
Too many lives are at risk.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.539
What if I could convince Woodford
I have a better way?

10:23.540 --> 10:24.875
Do you?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.211
Guns were never a major
part of their previous jobs.

10:28.879 --> 10:32.382
Find out why and convince
them the old ways were better.

10:33.258 --> 10:37.221
You want the outcome of this case
to rest on Caffrey's slippery shoulders?

10:37.387 --> 10:39.306
Hmm. You're always
manipulating, Matthew.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.807
Yeah, well not this time.

10:40.891 --> 10:44.394
I already told you I want you to succeed.
Your win is my win, man.

10:46.063 --> 10:49.066
Any new plan passes through me
before Woodford hears it.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.527
Why wouldn't it? We're partners.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.820
Yeah, the partner routine
may have worked with Luc,

10:54.154 --> 10:57.783
but you and I, let's just say
good anklets make for good partners.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.409
Okay.

11:00.244 --> 11:02.412
-But I got to say...
-Yeah?

11:03.080 --> 11:06.124
This has been more fun than a prison
sentence has any right to be.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.797
Hey, I don't want any surprises.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.882
I don't want to be left in the dark.

11:13.966 --> 11:15.342
Full illumination.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.135
And if there are any guns involved...

11:17.261 --> 11:19.346
The operation gets shut down. Don't worry.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.849
-I've got this handled.
-You sure?

11:21.932 --> 11:25.102
Your separation anxiety has
spiraled into control anxiety.

11:25.269 --> 11:26.520
Big time.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.021
You'd better get used to it.

11:28.105 --> 11:30.065
-Why?
-You're going to be a father.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.609
Hey, partner.

11:34.486 --> 11:35.946
Be careful out there.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.031
Always.

11:51.837 --> 11:55.716
Come. Admire ingenuity in its
most rudimentary form.

11:57.551 --> 11:58.969
<i>Disco Inferno?</i>

11:59.636 --> 12:03.515
Despite being a mere toddler
during the whole craze,

12:03.599 --> 12:06.685
I regret never wearing
a "Disco sucks" t-shirt.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.812
It had its time and place, Moz.

12:08.896 --> 12:14.526
Well, for the past 35 hours, my time
has been spent consumed by this.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.321
Behold. The randomizer.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.114
For our little algorithm.

12:19.198 --> 12:20.407
Yeah. Watch closely.

12:21.783 --> 12:24.369
The red lights, international airports.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.206
Green ones, international carriers.

12:27.789 --> 12:30.042
And the white, just to give it
the full Christmas effect?

12:30.501 --> 12:32.503
The white lights represent variables

12:32.586 --> 12:35.506
that your genius friends at the FBI
failed to identify.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.218
Variables which I believe,
due to their sheer number,

12:39.384 --> 12:42.054
represent airport warehouses.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.181
Warehouses?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.558
Where they store the cash when it arrives.

12:46.725 --> 12:51.438
Well, not that I'm complaining,
but why warehouses and not vaults?

12:51.688 --> 12:55.859
Vaults come after the Federal Reserve
come to pick up the cash

12:55.943 --> 12:57.194
-from the warehouses.
-Wait a second.

12:57.277 --> 13:02.074
Airports. Cash from overseas.
The Federal Reserve. Moz...

13:02.157 --> 13:06.537
Whispered about whenever thieves
gather to tell lies to each other,

13:06.620 --> 13:08.163
denied by all governments.

13:08.247 --> 13:11.583
The one thing that draws
a blank on Google.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.544
The score of scores.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.087
The exchange.

13:15.546 --> 13:20.050
Unmarked and untraceable
Yankee tourist dollars,

13:20.259 --> 13:24.304
gathered and lovingly swaddled
by central banks all over the world.

13:24.388 --> 13:27.683
Before being flown back to the US
for redistribution.

13:27.808 --> 13:34.773
But the only thing is no one
knows where or when or who

13:35.190 --> 13:38.402
until the algorithm has its way
with the computer.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.072
(TYPING)

13:42.614 --> 13:43.949
(BEEPING)

13:49.288 --> 13:51.123
Chicago O'Hare.

13:52.249 --> 13:53.876
Aviana Airways.

13:54.543 --> 13:55.836
Warehouse nine.

13:56.170 --> 14:00.549
Well, I love the light show, Moz, but we
already knew what the algorithm did,

14:00.757 --> 14:03.343
and why Woodford is waiting until
the money comes down.

14:03.427 --> 14:06.138
Woodford has it, but he can't control it.

14:06.597 --> 14:07.806
We can.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.266
You can bring the mountain
to Mohammed?

14:09.641 --> 14:11.768
MOZZIE: Yes. I've adjusted the algorithm.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.272
Let's route some money
to JFK International,

14:15.439 --> 14:19.776
via Oceanic Airways, flight 1097.

14:21.111 --> 14:24.698
-You are a truly talented man.
-(CHUCKLES)

14:24.781 --> 14:26.950
Talent hits a target no one else can hit.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.953
Genius hits a target no one else can see.

14:30.162 --> 14:32.331
All right, this should convince
Woodford that we have enough time

14:32.456 --> 14:33.707
to come up with a better plan.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.543
Oh, so you need me to explain it to him,
demonstrate how it all works.

14:36.793 --> 14:40.005
Whoa, whoa, whoa, patience.
Look, Woodford is on a mole hunt.

14:40.172 --> 14:41.673
Why risk it now?

14:41.798 --> 14:44.635
For you. So I can watch your back.

14:45.469 --> 14:46.803
Moz...

14:47.012 --> 14:51.600
You know, this hasn't always
been about you protecting me.

14:52.601 --> 14:53.810
I know.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.146
-You need me there.
-You're right.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.815
You're right.
The minute I see an opening...

14:58.941 --> 15:00.692
Until then, I need to tell Peter
what you've done here.

15:00.776 --> 15:02.778
This is amazing.

15:04.696 --> 15:07.324
Thank you.
The minute I see an opening, okay?

15:11.453 --> 15:12.538
(INAUDIBLE)

15:28.720 --> 15:31.181
Our inside man has outside business.

15:35.727 --> 15:36.979
Who is she?

15:37.646 --> 15:39.523
FBI case. Can't discuss.

15:39.815 --> 15:41.650
Cannot discuss, or do not know?

15:41.900 --> 15:44.403
Neal and I are still working
on other investigations.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.989
You won't admit the truth,
because then I would be right.

15:47.155 --> 15:50.158
No, it's not about being right,
it's about bringing down the Panthers.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.369
Do you trust Caffrey?

15:53.328 --> 15:56.415
-I do.
-That will be your undoing, not mine.

15:56.832 --> 15:58.292
I'm sending Keller back in.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.169
You'll destroy this operation.

16:00.294 --> 16:03.714
No, you will destroy it
if you do not pull your CI.

16:03.881 --> 16:05.340
I will not pull Neal.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.886
I no longer see ourselves as
collaborators, Agent Burke.

16:09.261 --> 16:11.513
Do what you have to do,
and I will do the same.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.484
Jones.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.322
Know where this is?

16:29.907 --> 16:31.408
No, but I can find out.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.951
Call me when you do.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.579
I'm feeling the need
for a surprise inspection.

16:39.291 --> 16:42.252
-Where's Neal?
-Oh, he went to talk to you.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.464
I haven't seen him for hours.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.925
-And you were in your office?
-Until I came here.

16:49.218 --> 16:50.719
That's weird.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.358
NEAL: In the purloin world,
the Pink Panthers are royalty.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.652
No one better, before or since.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.570
It's why I risked my life to join.

17:08.654 --> 17:10.322
And almost lost it.

17:10.531 --> 17:12.616
That Diamond Mart heist in Barcelona.

17:12.741 --> 17:16.245
You walked in as rug merchants
and walked out with what, 30 million?

17:17.287 --> 17:19.665
Only 14, I'm afraid, after fencing.

17:19.748 --> 17:22.501
Still, 14 million
without an alarm going off,

17:22.584 --> 17:23.919
without a shot fired.

17:24.378 --> 17:26.088
Why use guns on this job?

17:26.421 --> 17:29.883
Elegant heists take weeks,
sometimes a year to prepare.

17:29.967 --> 17:33.470
Due to the algorithm, we will have,
at best, a couple of hours.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.597
Guns are the only option.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.474
What if I can give you days?

17:38.350 --> 17:41.436
What if I can make the algorithm
do what we want it to do?

17:41.520 --> 17:44.398
-If only that were possible.
-Control the algorithm, control the heist.

17:44.481 --> 17:47.234
I can override the system.
We pick the airports.

17:47.317 --> 17:50.195
We choose the flights.
We tell them where to deliver our cash.

17:50.279 --> 17:52.906
-Can't be done.
-Have I let you down yet?

17:54.408 --> 17:55.826
Quite the opposite.

17:56.785 --> 17:59.204
For years you guys have inspired me.

17:59.371 --> 18:01.415
You made me strive to be a better thief.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.375
Let me prove myself to you.

18:04.001 --> 18:06.962
Allow me to help you come up
with a new plan.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.589
Without guns?

18:08.672 --> 18:11.008
Guns only if it fails, but it won't fail.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.136
-You can really control the algorithm?
-Yeah.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.762
I'll show you.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.432
Well, that would be brilliant.

18:18.515 --> 18:21.810
The means should always justify the end.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.189
All right.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.316
Let's create a work of art.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.276
It'll be the talk of thieves
around the globe.

18:29.359 --> 18:30.652

18:33.530 --> 18:35.282
LUC: Peter is covering for him.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.117
KELLER: I told you.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.037
I want you back in, right away.

18:40.412 --> 18:41.705
I never left.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.707
What about this mole situation?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.834
He wants a mole, give him one.

18:46.251 --> 18:47.503
Consider it done.

18:52.257 --> 18:55.469
You two have been spending
an awful lot of time together.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.221
I fear bonding.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.848
Me and the suit, no. Never.

18:59.932 --> 19:01.141
Ever.

19:01.225 --> 19:02.518
I want answers.

19:02.601 --> 19:04.311
To any particular question?

19:04.603 --> 19:06.438
You're holding something back.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.065
NEAL: You're not?

19:08.148 --> 19:10.943
Mmm... When you ask questions,
you're avoiding answers.

19:11.109 --> 19:12.528
NEAL: Oh, and what did you just do?

19:12.611 --> 19:15.614
Okay, I'll show you mine,
you show me yours.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.242
This is going to require much more liquor.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.622
You first.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.124
I know what Woodford is going after.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.335
-Half...
-A billion in cash.

19:28.961 --> 19:30.629
I guess we're keeping the same secret.

19:30.879 --> 19:33.173
There. Everything out in the open.

19:33.382 --> 19:35.717
We're not done yet.
Where were you this morning?

19:35.843 --> 19:38.262
(SIGHS) You really miss that anklet,
don't you?

19:38.971 --> 19:41.598
You're answering questions
with a question again.

19:42.099 --> 19:44.101
-He was helping me...
-Yes.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.227
...with this.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.354
NEAL: Mozzie has created a randomizer.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.607
More importantly, a way to control it.

19:50.691 --> 19:55.195
And now, thanks to Moz,
we can move the money to wherever

19:55.279 --> 19:56.613
and whenever we want,

19:56.864 --> 20:00.242
which is why Woodford is letting me
return the Panthers to their glory years.

20:00.576 --> 20:02.369
A new plan with no guns?

20:02.744 --> 20:05.205
And in the spirit of full illumination,

20:05.706 --> 20:07.666
we'd like you to help us design it.

20:09.126 --> 20:12.546
We'll make it good for Woodford,
you make it better for the FBI.

20:13.213 --> 20:16.383
You want me to help you plan a new heist?

20:16.758 --> 20:19.469
Our best, and final.

20:20.971 --> 20:22.806
So, you up for it, Suit?

20:25.142 --> 20:26.310
It won't work.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.395
Then think of something better.

20:28.478 --> 20:30.898
I pitched a better idea two hours ago.

20:30.981 --> 20:31.982
Suitcases?

20:32.065 --> 20:34.443
Yeah, all we have to do is get
the money to the baggage claim.

20:34.526 --> 20:37.029
Two problems: getting
the gang on the tarmac,

20:37.112 --> 20:39.156
and getting a truckload of cash off.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.408
Problems, or opportunities?

20:41.491 --> 20:43.160
He'd be a terrible con.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.871
Problems. There are too many
people in baggage claim.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.706
It's not a safe place to do a takedown.

20:47.998 --> 20:50.584
But the entire airport
has the same problem.

20:50.834 --> 20:53.587
We need to get the money off-campus.
Then the takedown.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.422
Not without attracting security.

20:55.506 --> 20:57.591
Cars and trucks will be searched.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.134
(GRUNTS)

20:59.885 --> 21:02.513

21:08.602 --> 21:09.853
Underground.

21:10.896 --> 21:12.773
Not bad. How?

21:13.315 --> 21:14.733
Sewer system.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.944
It's not exactly elegant.

21:17.110 --> 21:20.447
Uh... Abandoned subway tunnels.

21:20.572 --> 21:23.158
Mmm... They don't run as far as JFK.

21:23.242 --> 21:27.120
Yeah, utility channels don't have
enough elbow room for men and money.

21:28.664 --> 21:30.082
Tubes.

21:30.374 --> 21:31.542
Tubes?

21:31.792 --> 21:33.377
Pneumatic tubes.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.212
Remember the old bank drive-through?

21:35.295 --> 21:38.465
Put your check in the canister, it gets
sucked in the tube over to the bank.

21:38.632 --> 21:40.634
Yeah, and then they send a lollipop back.

21:40.801 --> 21:44.513
The New York Postal Service put the
first one into operation in 1897.

21:44.596 --> 21:48.058
By the 1920s there were vast networks
linking post offices around the city.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.102
Yeah, miles of them
still exist underground.

21:50.185 --> 21:52.354
They've been waiting for us
right under JFK.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.898
When it was Idlewild,
all airmail landed there,

21:54.982 --> 21:57.901
hauled to Warehouse 17,
where it was loaded into canisters.

21:57.985 --> 22:00.654
When seconds later, through the tubes,

22:00.737 --> 22:04.741
it landed in a sorting center
right outside the airport.

22:04.825 --> 22:06.910
Please tell me the building still exists.

22:06.994 --> 22:08.579
According to the Internet maps, it does.

22:08.704 --> 22:11.623
That's the perfect way to get the money
out of the airport without being seen.

22:11.707 --> 22:13.917
Peter, you've missed your true calling.

22:14.001 --> 22:15.210
Oh, there's still time.

22:15.294 --> 22:17.004
Now, the building's in an industrial area,

22:17.087 --> 22:19.256
so it'll be easy
for the tac team to isolate.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.341
We can set up a four-block
safety perimeter.

22:21.550 --> 22:24.136
Woodford and his gang collect
the money, we move in.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.138
-Perfect.
-JONES: Except for one thing.

22:26.471 --> 22:28.432
I mean, if the tubes do exist,

22:28.599 --> 22:30.434
they still need the air compressors
that power them.

22:30.934 --> 22:33.353
And what are the odds they still
work after 60 years?

22:34.479 --> 22:36.106
Only one way to find out.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.401
All right, according to the schematics,

22:39.526 --> 22:42.487
the tubes and the air compressor
should be behind the south wall.

22:42.613 --> 22:45.991
Oh, I'm under strict doctor's orders
to avoid all manual labor.

That's when I thought all
the other Panthers would be here.

22:53.332 --> 22:56.210
I'm not bringing the Panthers here
until I know the equipment still exists.

22:56.335 --> 22:59.338
Sledgehammers are abhorrent
to a man of my finesse.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.924

Then Burke is going to have to
convince them to hold back,

36:16.009 --> 36:17.678
for the good of the mission.

36:17.845 --> 36:19.555
Otherwise, Luc, he died for nothing.

36:19.680 --> 36:21.640
Oh, you got this all figured out, huh?

36:22.641 --> 36:25.185
I'm just trying to do the right thing.

36:37.865 --> 36:40.242
Did forensics find anything
on the dumpster or Luc's body?

36:40.325 --> 36:42.286
Nothing. No fingerprints, no signs of DNA.

36:42.369 --> 36:44.079
Nothing to link him to Woodford.

36:44.162 --> 36:46.456
So Luc was killed someplace else
and dumped there.

36:46.540 --> 36:48.166
We don't even have
enough for an arrest warrant.

36:48.333 --> 36:49.877
JONES: Yeah, let alone a conviction.

36:50.210 --> 36:52.796
What about the man he just killed?
There were five eyewitnesses.

36:53.297 --> 36:54.882
Yeah, subpoena us.

36:55.007 --> 36:56.550
Four will swear they didn't see anything,

36:56.633 --> 36:59.428
and I'll be face down in a garbage
barge bound for South Carolina.

36:59.511 --> 37:01.430
Wow, that's where
New York's garbage goes?

37:01.513 --> 37:04.391
One of several places, and I don't
want my body ending up at any of them.

37:05.058 --> 37:07.811
I just got off the phone with
Deputy Director Pillar.

37:07.895 --> 37:11.815
He convinced Interpol that
the only way to get justice for Luc

37:11.899 --> 37:13.442
is to go through with the plan.

37:13.650 --> 37:15.277
Take the Panthers down for the heist?

37:15.402 --> 37:17.154
Guess they want to finger
Woodford for a sweeter deal.

37:17.362 --> 37:19.406
-And Keller?
-He's mine now.

37:20.407 --> 37:21.992
-We've got less than 72 hours.
-(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

37:22.075 --> 37:23.577
Bring up the map.

37:45.682 --> 37:46.808
(HEART BEATING)

37:52.481 --> 37:53.607
(EXHALES)

37:59.154 --> 38:00.948
(DOOR OPENING)

38:04.660 --> 38:06.954
Hi, honey, I'm so sorry. I...

38:07.079 --> 38:08.789
Sit.

38:13.126 --> 38:15.587
(SIGHS) I know someone died today.

38:16.588 --> 38:20.133
I know it was a law enforcement
officer, and it's horrible.

38:20.634 --> 38:23.136
-It is, but...
-But you didn't even call.

38:23.762 --> 38:26.682
You didn't even give me a chance
to reschedule the appointment.

38:27.140 --> 38:29.309
Our child's first sonogram, Peter.

38:29.434 --> 38:32.145
-I just got so wrapped up...
-In the case.

38:32.229 --> 38:34.064
The Peter Burke tunnel vision.

38:35.482 --> 38:37.192
Let me make this clear.

38:37.276 --> 38:41.196
I am not going to raise our child
as a married single mother.

38:41.321 --> 38:42.614
No, never.

38:42.698 --> 38:45.117
And he's going to be
the first priority in this family.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.368
He will... He...

38:46.702 --> 38:48.745
Wait. He?

38:50.414 --> 38:52.207
It's a boy?

38:52.457 --> 38:54.209
And he's perfect.

38:56.378 --> 38:58.380
Oh, God, El.

38:59.882 --> 39:01.466
It's a boy.

39:01.550 --> 39:02.759
Yeah.

39:03.218 --> 39:04.970
I really need to kiss you right now.

39:11.310 --> 39:13.604
So I've already hacked you
into the network.

39:13.687 --> 39:15.230
-Okay.
-Okay?

39:15.856 --> 39:18.483
You type in this code first.
That overrides their system.

39:18.984 --> 39:21.653
Then these numbers.
They manipulate the algorithm.

39:21.737 --> 39:22.905
-These numbers?
-Yup.

39:22.988 --> 39:24.740
-That's all I have to do?
-Yeah.

39:24.823 --> 39:27.659
The arrival time is 3:45 p.m., Thursday,

39:27.743 --> 39:29.995
JFK, Oceanic flight 1097.

39:30.454 --> 39:33.832
Money should be loaded into
Warehouse 17 an hour after that.

39:33.916 --> 39:35.417
You're positive about this?

39:36.460 --> 39:37.794
Neal.

39:38.045 --> 39:39.755
This is a precision instrument.

39:40.422 --> 39:41.965
You're amazing, Moz.

39:42.424 --> 39:44.635
None of this would be
possible without you.

39:46.261 --> 39:48.805
-And?
-And?

39:49.097 --> 39:51.683
And now that the Panthers
are down a mole,

39:51.767 --> 39:53.852
-it's the perfect time...
-No, no.

39:54.019 --> 39:56.855
Woodford just killed his most trusted man.

39:57.648 --> 39:59.441
Keller could have stuck that chip on you.

39:59.650 --> 40:00.901
Or you.

40:00.984 --> 40:03.612
Neal, since we've met, we've always
been watching out for each other,

40:03.695 --> 40:04.821
so why not now?

40:04.905 --> 40:06.198
You have to trust me, Moz.

40:06.281 --> 40:08.200
I always have. But lately...

40:08.283 --> 40:10.118
No, trust doesn't have a time limit.

40:10.369 --> 40:11.912
You've been lying to me.

40:12.246 --> 40:15.415
Holding back information, which is worse.

40:16.291 --> 40:17.459
I have my reasons.

40:20.921 --> 40:22.214
What is this?

40:22.297 --> 40:23.966
Why are you not telling me?

40:24.049 --> 40:27.970
Are you helping the FBI,
or are you taking the money?

40:28.136 --> 40:30.514
Just be patient for a little longer, okay?

40:30.722 --> 40:32.850
This is all going down now.

40:32.933 --> 40:34.685
You said you had a bigger plan.

40:35.477 --> 40:37.229
Where the hell do I fit in?

40:42.776 --> 40:44.403
I'm glad you stopped by.

40:45.028 --> 40:46.655
El's in bed by 7:00 now.

40:46.822 --> 40:48.699
It gets a little quiet around here.

40:50.701 --> 40:51.910
So how angry was she?

40:52.119 --> 40:55.414
(SIGHS) Not as angry as I was at myself.

40:57.124 --> 40:58.709
Never again.

41:08.385 --> 41:09.761
The Panthers are down a man.

41:11.305 --> 41:12.723
Does that affect the plan?

41:12.931 --> 41:14.224
It could.

41:16.268 --> 41:18.478
We need to replace him
with someone we trust.

41:19.104 --> 41:20.355
You have someone in mind?

41:24.902 --> 41:26.653
NEAL: Let's get to work, gentlemen.

41:27.446 --> 41:28.906
First, we have a problem to solve.

41:29.573 --> 41:31.033
Didn't I already solve it?

41:31.366 --> 41:32.910
We already know how
long it's going to take

41:32.993 --> 41:34.703
Braxnet Security to respond to the alarm.

41:34.828 --> 41:37.497
I've calculated how many men we need
to load the money into the tubes

41:37.623 --> 41:38.999
in that amount of time.

41:39.082 --> 41:41.001
-Because now we're a man short.
-Yeah.

41:41.168 --> 41:43.212
On the other hand,
there's one less share to load.

41:43.504 --> 41:45.422
I don't leave money on the table.

41:45.506 --> 41:46.757
I assume you have a solution.

41:47.049 --> 41:48.467
I do.

41:55.015 --> 41:56.683
KELLER: Well, look who we have here.

41:59.061 --> 42:01.522
-You know him?
-Our paths have crossed.

42:02.022 --> 42:03.899
More times than I care to remember.

42:03.982 --> 42:06.068
Consider the stamp job his audition.

42:06.985 --> 42:08.946
And he's the mastermind
who came up with the tubes.

42:11.823 --> 42:14.535
I'll decide who auditions, Mr. Caffrey.

42:23.836 --> 42:25.629
Now, who the hell are you?
