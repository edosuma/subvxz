after I was already
in bed.

19:17.020 --> 19:18.317
It's you.

19:23.460 --> 19:25.655
Uh, what does that mean?

19:26.390 --> 19:28.392
You're not ready

19:28.460 --> 19:30.769
to spearhead something
of this magnitude.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.233
You know,
back in college,

19:36.270 --> 19:37.760
we had this friend
named Hagadorn,

19:37.840 --> 19:40.673
but he's a real jokey
son-of—a bitch.

19:40.740 --> 19:42.605
Loved to get a rise
out of you.

19:42.680 --> 19:46.047
So, anyway,
one day we're in
the mess hall,

19:46.110 --> 19:47.475
and we're eating
tater tots,

19:47.550 --> 19:49.347
stuffing our faces
like wild animals

19:49.420 --> 19:52.912
'cause we didn't
have the cash
for anything else.

19:52.990 --> 19:56.448
And Hagadorn,
moron that he is,

19:56.520 --> 19:59.159
reaches over and grabs
one off my plate.

19:59.230 --> 20:02.825
Now, I know he's tryin'
to get a rise from me,
right?

20:02.900 --> 20:04.458
So I keep my mouth shut.

20:06.130 --> 20:08.337
And then he does it again.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.459
Takes another one
right off my plate.

20:12.310 --> 20:13.709
So I pick up a fork,

20:13.780 --> 20:15.839
and I look him in his eye
and I say, "Hagadorn,

20:15.910 --> 20:18.401
"you son of a bitch,
if you do that
one more time,

20:18.480 --> 20:22.644
"I'm gonna take this fork
and I'm gonna put it right
through your fucking hand."

20:22.720 --> 20:26.542
And Haggy, that stupid
piece of shit, he thinks
I'm joking, right?

20:26.620 --> 20:28.918
He's laughing,
he's spewing food
out of his mouth, right?

20:28.990 --> 20:30.924
He reaches over
and takes another one...

the hand, you know,

21:09.130 --> 21:12.167

son of a bitch can't even
make his fist anymore.

21:12.230 --> 21:13.834
We joke about that.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.333
But the fact
of the matter is,

21:15.400 --> 21:17.334
whenever he looks
In my eyes,

21:19.010 --> 21:21.899
he knows he's lookin'
at somebody who's
gonna go all the way.

21:23.610 --> 21:26.408

stand behind me
than across from me.
