WEBVTT

00:06.047 --> 00:07.632
Don't go in
there, idiot.

00:09.008 --> 00:10.176
I told you.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.553
Why would you
do that?

00:11.553 --> 00:12.846
Si.
>> What?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.222
>> Why are you doing
closed caption?

00:14.222 --> 00:15.515
Why don't you turn
the volume up?

00:15.515 --> 00:17.058
>> Because I'm
reading it.

00:17.058 --> 00:18.476
It's better that way.
Nobody reads any more.

00:18.476 --> 00:19.477
>> What?!

00:19.477 --> 00:21.271
You're not supposed
to read television.

00:21.271 --> 00:24.691
>> But this is
Murder She Wrote.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.111
Get it?

00:28.111 --> 00:28.987
Wrote.

00:28.987 --> 00:29.863
Okay.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.448
You have to read
what is written.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.031
>> How long are
you going

00:32.031 --> 00:32.824
to stay over here?

00:32.824 --> 00:33.867
>> Why?
Am I bothering you?

00:33.867 --> 00:34.868
>> Yes, you're
bothering me.

00:34.868 --> 00:35.827
>> Well hey,

00:35.827 --> 00:37.078
go in your bedroom
or somewhere.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.329
Go in another room.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.247
>> It's my house!

00:39.247 --> 00:40.874
>> What does that
got to do with it?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.834
>> Why don't you watch
this at your own house?

00:42.834 --> 00:44.210
>> I don't get
this channel.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.628
Besides, I hadn't
got that fancy

00:45.628 --> 00:46.838
little black box.

00:47.672 --> 00:48.798
>> Can I just buy
you the box?

00:48.798 --> 00:49.632
>> No.

00:49.632 --> 00:50.633
Because, hey,
if I had all these

00:50.633 --> 00:52.218
channels at
my home,

00:52.218 --> 00:53.386
I'd never leave
the house.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.721
>> That would be
a good thing.

00:54.721 --> 00:55.972
You need to stay
home more.

00:55.972 --> 00:57.223
>> No.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.225
I have to get out every
once in awhile.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.396
>> Somebody's getting
married?

01:03.396 --> 01:04.355
Oh shoot.
Okay, wait.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.064
What is it?

01:05.064 --> 01:05.899
>> Wrong song.

01:06.941 --> 01:08.026
>> Hey, hey!

01:08.026 --> 01:09.110
I'm trying to read
the TV here

01:09.110 --> 01:10.945
and focus
on my show.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.197
>> Don't they
look cute?

01:12.197 --> 01:13.072
>> They do.

01:13.072 --> 01:14.908
>> We graduate tomorrow!

01:14.908 --> 01:16.701
>> Our parents have
this huge party

01:16.701 --> 01:17.535
planned for us,

01:17.535 --> 01:18.870
and we're
super excited.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.413
>> I'm so excited!

01:20.413 --> 01:21.956
>> So when are we
going to ULM, Sadie?

01:21.956 --> 01:23.249
Let me give you
a little tour,

01:23.249 --> 01:25.251
show you around
the business school.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.924
Show you were I use
to hang out...

01:30.924 --> 01:32.759
and learn.

01:34.969 --> 01:36.763
At least go look.

01:36.763 --> 01:37.847
>> It's exciting,

01:37.847 --> 01:39.307
but then again
it's like wow,

01:39.307 --> 01:40.225
this is like real.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.142
And it's kind
of hitting me.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.268
>> I don't wanna
be an adult yet.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.353
>> No.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.687
>> Pay for
things myself.

01:44.687 --> 01:46.272
>> No.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.525
Just hold on as long
as we can, Cole.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.943
Didn't you go to
college for like,

01:49.943 --> 01:51.027
PE education?

01:51.027 --> 01:52.195
>> Yeah.

01:52.195 --> 01:54.614
>> You wasted your money
and got a degree in PE?

01:54.614 --> 01:56.074
>> Si, it's a good degree.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.116
>> What?
Recess?

01:57.116 --> 01:59.202
>> You learn about the
physical body

01:59.202 --> 02:00.370
and how to
stay healthy--

02:00.370 --> 02:01.496
>> I know, you go
outside and play.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.706
Ring the bell!
Lets go have recess!

02:04.707 --> 02:06.125
My plans are kind
of up in the air.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.001
It's so hard to
narrow it down,

02:07.001 --> 02:08.586
because this is
or future.

02:08.586 --> 02:09.921
How are you suppose
to decide that when

02:09.921 --> 02:11.881
ever you're
eighteen and...

02:11.881 --> 02:13.049
stupid,
you know?

02:13.049 --> 02:15.468
Like...

02:15.718 --> 02:16.553
>> All I'm asking,

02:16.553 --> 02:18.179
is one tour with
your dad.

02:18.179 --> 02:19.055
>> Hold it, hold it.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.348
She's fixin' to say
who done it.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.182
>> Si.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.476
We're having
a conversation.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.144
>> Sadie, just do it
for your dad.

02:25.144 --> 02:26.354
Then you can make
your decision.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.439
Then after that,
no pressure.

02:28.439 --> 02:29.440
Right, Willie?

02:29.440 --> 02:30.942
>> It's the doctor!
I knew it!

02:30.942 --> 02:31.985
>> Si!

02:31.985 --> 02:32.986
>> I will go on a tour,

02:32.986 --> 02:35.029
if Si goes on the
tour with us.

02:35.029 --> 02:35.864
>> Sadie.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.073
This wasn't
a negotiation.

02:37.073 --> 02:37.907
>> Here's the deal.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.785
Let me finish reading
this season,

02:40.785 --> 02:44.706
then me, Sadie and you
will go to ULM, okay.

02:44.706 --> 02:45.707
And then you're
going to sign

02:45.707 --> 02:47.083
up for two classes.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.668
One for hospitality.

02:48.668 --> 02:51.004
And the other one for
TV etiquette, okay.

02:51.004 --> 02:54.382
Cause you need work
on both of them, nephew.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.425
Now.

02:56.551 --> 02:57.427
What a deal.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.344
What the...

02:58.344 --> 02:59.262
That's the problem
with kids today,

02:59.262 --> 03:01.097
they don't read
enough television.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.859
The ULM stadium.

03:12.859 --> 03:13.985
Is this awesome
or what?

03:13.985 --> 03:14.861
It's great.

03:14.861 --> 03:15.987
But why are we
on the foorball field?

03:15.987 --> 03:17.614
>> Well, I wanted this
to be big and exciting.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.073
I mean, if you're gonna
go to school,

03:19.073 --> 03:21.159
you need to get the feel
of the field.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.577
Look at this, huh.

03:22.577 --> 03:23.620
Lets just picture it.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.913
Close your eyes,

03:24.913 --> 03:28.499
picture the stadium
full of people screaming.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.003
>> Dad, I've been
to a ULM game.

03:32.003 --> 03:32.962
>> Picture it, Sadie.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.213
Picture yourself
sitting there in the

03:34.213 --> 03:36.841
student sections,
crowd's going crazy-

03:36.841 --> 03:38.593
>> Touch down!
>> Si!

03:38.593 --> 03:40.345
>> What?
It was a great play.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.805
Sixty five yard pass,
touch down.

03:42.805 --> 03:43.973
>> Okay.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.725
Sadie, just picture-
There he is.

03:45.725 --> 03:46.392
Hi.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.018
>> You must be Sadie.

03:47.018 --> 03:47.769
>> Yes.

03:47.769 --> 03:48.728
>> I'm Dr. Joshua Stockley.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.104
>> Sadie, this is
the big dean of

03:50.104 --> 03:51.356
the business school.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.440
>> Actually I'm a
associate professor

03:52.440 --> 03:54.192
of political science.

03:55.902 --> 03:56.861
>> You're not the dean?

03:56.861 --> 03:57.695
>> You know, the dean
got a little busy,

03:57.695 --> 03:59.030
so he sent the
next best thing.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.531
>> I thought the dean
was coming.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.283
>> Awkward.

04:02.283 --> 04:03.910
>> I have arranged
a big tour of ULM

04:03.910 --> 04:06.079
to persuade Sadie
that this is the best

04:06.079 --> 04:08.081
place for her to be
after high school.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.541
So, if you'll turn your
attention to jumbotron,

04:10.541 --> 04:12.585
I've got a
"Welcome to ULM"

04:12.585 --> 04:14.921
video made by-

04:14.921 --> 04:16.422
Actually, I just told
Jep to do it, so.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.716
I'm pulling out all
the stops to convince Sadie,

04:18.716 --> 04:20.176
but there's no doubt
in my mind that

04:20.176 --> 04:21.678
after seeing this video,

04:21.678 --> 04:23.471
she'll be dawning
maroon and gold,

04:23.471 --> 04:25.890
and cheering
on those ULM Warhawks.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.017
>> All right,
here we go.

04:28.851 --> 04:31.020
Ready to go.

04:32.438 --> 04:33.356
Any second.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.399
Any second, boys.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.400
I don't think
this is working.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.567
Come on,
man.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.069
>> Hey Dad, you can just
send it to my phone.

04:38.069 --> 04:38.861
I think that be easier.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.196
>> No, no, no, no.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.698
Unfortunately, the
video is much less

04:41.698 --> 04:44.033
impressive when
it doesn't play.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.788
And every second
that ticks by,

04:48.788 --> 04:52.667
all I can hear is,
"Gap year, gap year."

04:54.460 --> 04:56.129
All right,
here we go.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.006
Sadie, you're gonna
love this.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.424
With famous alumni,

04:59.424 --> 05:02.885
like Willie Robertson
and etc.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.679
ULM Business School,

05:04.679 --> 05:06.723
taking you from
the class room-

05:06.723 --> 05:07.849
Oh no.

05:07.849 --> 05:08.766
Sadie,
there you are.

05:08.766 --> 05:10.059
Oh no.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.019
To the moon!

05:11.019 --> 05:12.770
No, dad.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.689
From ULM to the
White House,

05:14.689 --> 05:15.857
to the moon,
Sadie.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.275
>> Jep did not write
all this stuff.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.359
That was awesome,
huh?

05:18.359 --> 05:20.903
>> Dad, that was...

05:22.030 --> 05:23.322
Pretty good, but...

05:23.322 --> 05:25.074
I don't think business
is really my thing.

05:25.074 --> 05:28.286
Like, it s not really what
I'm thinking long term.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.203
>> I didn't think
I was going

05:29.203 --> 05:30.538
to be in
business either.

05:30.538 --> 05:31.706
That's why I got
a PE degree.

05:31.706 --> 05:32.874
>> What else you
got here?

05:32.874 --> 05:35.001
You got horri-culture,
birdology?

05:35.001 --> 05:36.335
>> Ornithology.

05:36.335 --> 05:37.253
>> What about acting?

05:37.253 --> 05:38.254
>> Acting!

05:38.254 --> 05:40.173
>> We do have theatre
and drama classes.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.424
>> Si, we could
do it together,

05:41.424 --> 05:42.467
and be in
scenes together.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.551
>> There it is.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.886
>> Okay, ya'll are not
going to school together.

05:44.886 --> 05:45.928
>> Hey, I may sign
up for it.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.472
>> Si, we're not out
here for you.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.432
>> Okay, yeah.
All right, I get it.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.266
>> But hey,

05:50.266 --> 05:51.392
if that gets you
out here?

05:51.392 --> 05:52.727
We'll go look at a
couple of theatre classes.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.729
>> Oh my gosh,
yes!

05:54.729 --> 05:55.605
>> All right,
lets go.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.522
>> This is gonna
be so fun.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.356
>> It is.

05:57.356 --> 05:57.940
Hang on,
wait for me.

05:57.940 --> 05:58.816
In acting,

05:58.816 --> 05:59.567
you can be whatever
you wanna be.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.401
Next thing you know,

06:00.401 --> 06:01.569
you're in
Murder She Wrote,

06:01.569 --> 06:02.528
and everybody's
reading it.

06:02.528 --> 06:06.574
Si, this is
not for you.

06:06.574 --> 06:11.120
wangy guitar music]

06:11.996 --> 06:13.039
Miss Kay, it's nice

06:13.039 --> 06:15.249
having you around
after fifty years.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.167
Well, it's nice

06:16.167 --> 06:17.293
having you around.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.045
I thought one day,
you wasn't ever

06:19.045 --> 06:20.004
gonna come home.

06:20.004 --> 06:21.130
>> Now I noticed
you have you got your

06:21.130 --> 06:23.132
pony tail like you had it
when you were sixteen.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.093
Always remember this,
to me,

06:25.093 --> 06:26.135
you're still sixteen.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.011
>> Thank you.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.221
You're still always
gonna be the

06:28.221 --> 06:30.098
eighteen year old
I remember too.

06:30.098 --> 06:30.932
All right,

06:30.932 --> 06:31.891
we brought you
all a surprise.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.184
Surprise.

06:33.184 --> 06:36.187
>> Where'd you come from?!

06:36.187 --> 06:38.439
>> We just got home
from college in Virginia

06:38.439 --> 06:39.357
to surprise Sadie
and Cole for

06:39.357 --> 06:40.399
their graduation
party.

06:40.399 --> 06:42.527
But we realized
there's only one thing

06:42.527 --> 06:46.197
better than a surprise,
two surprises.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.240
>> So when's the
last time you had

06:47.240 --> 06:48.574
a home cooked meal?

06:48.574 --> 06:51.119
>> Maybe the last
time we ere here.

06:52.495 --> 06:53.371
Virginia's great,

06:53.371 --> 06:54.956
but there's nothing
like home.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.791
>> I mean we are so
excited to be home.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.459
>> So excited.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.836
>> We did not
realize how much we

06:59.836 --> 07:01.045
would miss
everyone and-

07:01.045 --> 07:02.880
>> No.
>> Everything down here.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.881
>> We gotta put
a little

07:03.881 --> 07:05.091
meat their bones,
don t we?

07:05.091 --> 07:06.175
>> That boy looks
like he come out of

07:06.175 --> 07:07.176
a prisoner of
war camp there.

07:07.176 --> 07:09.011
>> But he's like
the marines.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.514
He's lean and mean.
But he's really nice.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.723
>> Mmm...

07:12.723 --> 07:14.475
>> But he can be mean
when if he wants to.

07:14.475 --> 07:17.478
>> So when you do eat,
what is it that you eat?

07:17.478 --> 07:20.857
>> Well, I mean we eat
a lot of salad and kale-

07:20.857 --> 07:21.649
>> What?

07:21.649 --> 07:22.859
>> You know,
kale salads.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.277
Kale?
Kale?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.862
>> Lots of kale,
tomatoes--

07:25.862 --> 07:27.905
>> What?

07:27.905 --> 07:28.906
>> Really?

07:28.906 --> 07:31.576
>> Salad with ranch,
kale and smoothies.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.910
Actually, we eat
pretty good.

07:32.910 --> 07:33.870
>> Well, we ccould
tell by looking at

07:33.870 --> 07:35.580
you that you really
been eating well.

07:36.831 --> 07:40.126
>> Well, me and Kate is
gluten-free, so...

07:40.126 --> 07:41.127
>> Gluten what?

07:41.127 --> 07:42.128
>> Gluten-free.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.379
>> Gluten-free?

07:43.379 --> 07:44.255
>> Mmm hmm.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.089
All right,
here's the deal.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.424
We're going
squirrel hunting.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.050
They needed a place
to hide out.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.260
>> Well, we can hide 'em
in the woods

07:49.260 --> 07:50.219
on the squirrel hunt.

07:50.219 --> 07:51.137
Get 'em in the woods.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.180
Who's gonna find us
down in there?

07:52.180 --> 07:53.431
>> Well, I think
they were just

07:53.431 --> 07:54.348
wanting to
hang out.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.349
>> You been doing any
squirrel hunting

07:55.349 --> 07:56.350
up there in
the college?

07:56.350 --> 07:57.226
>> I haven't.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.853
>> I killed more
squirrels, ducks,

07:58.853 --> 08:01.480
caught more fish while
attended college than at-

08:01.480 --> 08:03.691
>> That's why he went
an extra year.

08:03.691 --> 08:06.027
>> So, lets get him some
camouflage clothes on, Jase.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.153
>> All right,
ya'll are in.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.154
>> One thing I know
for sure,

08:08.154 --> 08:11.741
squirrels, trust me,
they are gluten free.

08:11.741 --> 08:12.658
>> Awesome.

08:13.784 --> 08:14.493
All right,
I guess it's

08:14.493 --> 08:15.620
a squirrel
group hunt.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.038
You're going back to
your roots, John Luke.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.581
Okay.

08:19.665 --> 08:20.583
Boom.

08:20.583 --> 08:21.626
Oh yeah.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.835
Boo-yah.

08:23.711 --> 08:26.088
>> Welcome to
acting class.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.006
So everyone,

08:27.006 --> 08:28.507
just spread out
a little bit,

08:28.507 --> 08:30.426
and we're gonna lunge
to your right,

08:30.426 --> 08:31.385
here we go.

08:31.385 --> 08:34.722
And over the hand,
like warrior pose.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.932
Very good.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.850
Lets go the other
side now.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.060
Get a deep lunge.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.353
Hey, gotta give
me some room, son.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.354
>> Doesn't that
feel great?

08:41.354 --> 08:42.688
You can actually
go down a little

08:42.688 --> 08:45.191
bit further here,
like a twist.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.567
Going back
to the Sixties.

08:46.567 --> 08:47.485
>> Please join
us, sir.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.319
>> I stretched
out this-

08:48.319 --> 08:49.362
I'm good, man.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.197
>> No observers allowed,
only participants.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.156
Only participants.

08:52.156 --> 08:53.574
>> If I can't convince
Sadie to study

08:53.574 --> 08:54.909
business at ULM,

08:54.909 --> 08:56.619
I'm willing to try
to convince her

08:56.619 --> 08:58.788
to stay at ULM and
study anything.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.831
If that means sitting in
on an acting class,

09:00.831 --> 09:02.833
well lights, camera,
and lets get this

09:02.833 --> 09:03.834
crap over with.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.836
>> A little shoulder
shrugging here.

09:05.836 --> 09:06.754
>> What is this for?

09:06.754 --> 09:08.589
>> Here we go...

09:08.589 --> 09:09.632
>> What the heck?

09:09.632 --> 09:11.467
>> We're gonna go into
the chair position,

09:11.467 --> 09:12.593
like in yoga.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.095
Like children's class.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.721
>> Come on, sir.
Please join in.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.014
You're liable to
learn something.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.015
>> From doing exercises?

09:18.015 --> 09:18.724
>> Yeah.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.767
>> Sir, please join us.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.102
>> I'm a PE major,
I'm good.

09:21.102 --> 09:21.978
>> Join in.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.062
>> I'm good.
We're fixin' to leave.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.273
Although I wouldn't exactly
call this a class,

09:25.273 --> 09:27.608
it's more like a daycare
for grown ups.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.567
>> So we're gonna say,

09:28.567 --> 09:30.736
"Red leather,
yellow leather."

09:30.736 --> 09:32.280
So one at a time,
please.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.282
Red leather,
yellow leather.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.533
>> Very good,
very good.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.243
Red leather,
yellow leather.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.160
>> All right,
excellent.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.037
>> Red yeller leath-
Red leather-

09:40.037 --> 09:41.539
>> No.
>> Shut up.

09:42.456 --> 09:43.374
I can't believe
they actually give

09:43.374 --> 09:45.167
college credit for
a grown up version

09:45.167 --> 09:46.460
of Simon Says.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.045
I wouldn't be
surprised after all

09:48.045 --> 09:49.964
this warming up,
we spend the rest of

09:49.964 --> 09:51.882
the class playing
in a sand box.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.510
>> Now, in embody an
animal and perform

09:54.510 --> 09:56.387
that for us, okay.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.430
I'm gonna do
a seahorse.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.307
That's my spirit animal.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.474
That's a weird
spirit animal.

10:00.474 --> 10:01.726
>> Yeah.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.436
>> I think I'm gonna
be a butterfly.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.896
>> And...create!

10:05.896 --> 10:07.565
>> Nay. Nay.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.692
>> Become the animal.
Embody the animal.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.361
>> Si, seahorses don't
make noises.

10:12.361 --> 10:13.362
>> We don't need
nothing from the

10:13.362 --> 10:14.739
peanut gallery
down there.

10:14.739 --> 10:15.906
>> I'm just saying,
they're under water,

10:15.906 --> 10:16.866
they don't make noises.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.827
>> Pew! Pew!
Nay. Nay.

10:19.827 --> 10:20.953
>> Seahorse don't
have guns.

10:20.953 --> 10:21.996
>> Hey,
yeah the do,

10:21.996 --> 10:23.539
if he's a
cowboy seahorse.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.333
>> Pew. Pew.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.542
>> Fantastic.
Well done.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.877
>> Nay. Nay.

10:27.877 --> 10:28.669
>> All right guys,

10:28.669 --> 10:29.837
we gotta go
for realsies.

10:29.837 --> 10:30.796
We gotta tour.

10:30.796 --> 10:31.672
>> But we're just
about to do a scene

10:31.672 --> 10:32.965
from Shakespeare.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.259
>> Oh, that would
be awesome.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.761
>> Sadie.
You ready?

10:36.761 --> 10:38.220
>> Lets stay for this,
it'll be fun.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.096
You can do it too.

10:40.264 --> 10:42.433
>> We'll have you do a
scene from King Lear.

10:42.433 --> 10:46.437
I thought we was
gonna do Shakespeare?

10:50.608 --> 10:51.942
John Luke,
don t' ever tell anybody

10:51.942 --> 10:54.153
that I'm the one that
gave you this.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.654
Some where
along the line,

10:55.654 --> 10:59.033
some long legged
chick name Victoria-

10:59.033 --> 10:59.992
It's her secret.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.285
The secret is,

11:01.285 --> 11:04.288
this scares away
blood sucking gnats.

11:04.288 --> 11:07.625
They pawned it under
perfume to attract people,

11:07.625 --> 11:09.460
but it will do you no
good for your love life.

11:11.545 --> 11:12.463
The best way to do it,
put it on the back

11:12.463 --> 11:14.799
of your hand...
and do like that.

11:14.799 --> 11:15.674
That way you
keep it from

11:15.674 --> 11:16.717
spraying in your eyes.

11:16.717 --> 11:17.843
>> Phew!

11:17.843 --> 11:19.011
Man.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.012
That's not
that bad.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.013
>> Don't tell no body
I ever gave you that.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.765
>> All right,
one squirt.

11:22.765 --> 11:23.849
How about that?

11:23.849 --> 11:25.810
>> Under the arm pits is
always a good idea.

11:26.394 --> 11:29.480
I think we got the
mosquitos under control.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.482
You all ready to go?

11:31.482 --> 11:33.192
Lets all head off into
that direction.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.026
>> All right.

11:34.026 --> 11:34.944
>> Jase, you and
an old Jep,

11:34.944 --> 11:36.112
ya'll head up that hill
right there.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.697
>> Don't shoot me.
Shoot that way.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.697
>> All right.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.324
>> Be as quiet as
you can, Mary Kate.

11:40.324 --> 11:41.325
>> Kay.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.326
>> This is actually
Mary Kate's first

11:42.326 --> 11:43.452
time squirrel hunting.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.287
It's kind of a right of
passage for a Robertson.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.622
>> Yeah,
I mean,

11:46.622 --> 11:47.415
I think squirrels
are kind of cute,

11:47.415 --> 11:49.792
so I'm a little
bit nervous.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.585
>> You may get your
first squirrel right here.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.337
He's just sitting there,
right in the fork.

11:53.337 --> 11:54.505
>> Mmm-hmm,
I see him.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.632
>> Now take your
thing and pull it up.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.259
All right, now push
it down.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.552
Now take back
off safety.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.636
>> Okay.

12:00.636 --> 12:01.429
>> Take it off safety.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.471
>> Uhm...

12:02.471 --> 12:03.431
>> Take it off safety.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.557
>> My first time
squirrel hunting,

12:04.557 --> 12:06.684
was right after I saw
that movie Ice Age.

12:06.684 --> 12:07.768
>> I love that movie!

12:07.768 --> 12:09.270
>> With the little
squirrel thing?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.689
>> Yes.
He's my favorite.

12:11.689 --> 12:12.857
>> It was
traumatizing killing

12:12.857 --> 12:14.108
a squirrel after that.

12:14.108 --> 12:14.984
>> I bet.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.360
>> Take your time.

12:25.494 --> 12:26.162
>> Did I get him?

12:26.162 --> 12:27.121
>> You shot over him.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.165
Put another bullet
in your gun.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.251
Aim a little lower.
Shoot him.

12:34.503 --> 12:35.629
>> I got him.

12:35.629 --> 12:36.505
>> Good job, babe.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.757
Well you squirrel
killer you.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.926
Even more,
we got supper.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.679
>> Tea?
Or not to tea?

12:43.679 --> 12:45.222
That is the question.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.851
>> Okay, we're going to
do a scene now,

12:48.851 --> 12:50.269
from King Lear.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.522
Would you please perform
Cordelia for us, Sadie.

12:53.522 --> 12:54.356
>> Yeah.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.316
>> And Si,
you'll be King Lear.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.859
All right, we need
one more actor.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.611
Willie, would you
join us please?

12:58.611 --> 12:59.778
>> We've actually
gotta go.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.113
>> Okay,
if you do this,

13:01.113 --> 13:03.532
then I'll go do whatever
you want me to do.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.159
>> Okay.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.328
Sadie asked me to join
in and perform a scene.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.621
I might not be
an actor,

13:08.621 --> 13:10.498
but after watching
every one warm up...

13:10.498 --> 13:12.917
>> Red leather,
Yellow leather.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.084
>> There can't be
that much to it.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.337
>> This is a key scene
in King Lear,

13:16.337 --> 13:18.339
so please come up
and join the scene.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.341
>> And if performing
a classic play can

13:20.341 --> 13:22.718
convince Sadie that ULM
is the place for her...

13:22.718 --> 13:25.346
Bring me my wig, tights
and stage make-up.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.430
Nothing will come-

13:26.430 --> 13:28.933
My lady,
speaketh to thy king

13:28.933 --> 13:30.351
through thy heart.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.185
Si.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.145
>> My knight,
got south my steed.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.189
I feel like a ride
through my kingdom.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.315
And look,
while you re out,

13:36.315 --> 13:37.566
go ahead and
get me some tea

13:37.566 --> 13:38.692
and something to eat,
I'm hungry.

13:38.692 --> 13:39.818
>> Si, you're not
even reading the line.

13:39.818 --> 13:40.653
That's not even
in here.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.695
>> It's called
improv, son.

13:41.695 --> 13:44.281
>> Si, are you sure
you don't want a script?

13:44.281 --> 13:45.741
>> Nah.
I'd rather improv.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.284
>> Okay.
It's a masterpiece-

13:47.284 --> 13:48.327
>> I know, but hey,

13:48.327 --> 13:50.996
masterpieces can be
improved through improv.

13:50.996 --> 13:56.669
I'm not saying I'm
some expert actor like...

13:56.669 --> 13:59.296
Hey, but I'm holding my
own up there on the stage.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.798
>> I'm happy that I am.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.841
I cannot heave my
heart into my mouth.

14:02.841 --> 14:05.219
>> How, how, Cordelia-

14:05.219 --> 14:08.514
>> My child,
what art thou unhappy?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.057
>> Si,
that's not the line?

14:10.057 --> 14:11.183
>> Sure it is.

14:11.183 --> 14:14.645
If she's unhappy, the king
would be devastated.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.689
Look, I don't need
to follow a script.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.983
Improv is short
for improve.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.193
And look,
everything I say,

14:21.193 --> 14:22.611
I improve the scene.

14:22.611 --> 14:23.654
>> How, how Cord-

14:23.654 --> 14:26.657
>> Hey, shut thou mouth,
thy portly jester.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.992
>> Very good.
Very good.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.326
>> Lets just stick
to the script.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.869
>> If Shakespeare's
so great,

14:30.869 --> 14:32.371
how come nothing he
ever wrote

14:32.371 --> 14:33.831
makes any sense?

14:33.831 --> 14:38.252
Nobody knoweth what
he's trying to sayeth.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.004
>> Let it be so,

14:40.004 --> 14:42.506
thy truth then be
thy dower.

14:42.506 --> 14:43.716
>> And scene.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.425
>> Very nice.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.175
>> Dower?

14:45.175 --> 14:46.093
What in the world
is that?

14:46.093 --> 14:47.094
>> I have now idea
what a dower is?

14:47.094 --> 14:48.846
>> Why would
say it then?

14:48.846 --> 14:50.014
>> It's in the script!

14:50.014 --> 14:51.807
>> Hey, you're double-

14:51.807 --> 14:53.017
You're saying stuff
you don't even know

14:53.017 --> 14:54.143
what you're saying.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.103
>> So, how'd we do?

14:56.103 --> 14:57.980
>> Great, great.
Great job.

14:57.980 --> 14:58.856
>> All right,
thank you so much.

14:58.856 --> 14:59.648
I appreciate it, man.

14:59.648 --> 15:00.524
>> Oh, you're very welcome.

15:00.524 --> 15:01.609
>> You ready to roll?

15:01.609 --> 15:02.818
>> Dad, I'm actually
really interested in this.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.278
I had a lot of fun today.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.280
>> You know what,
stay here, get a degree,

15:06.280 --> 15:07.323
do a little theatre...

15:07.323 --> 15:08.741
She's fixin' to leave
the nest, buddy.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.161
Whether you like
it or not.

15:13.662 --> 15:14.496
If you're going
to eat a rodent,

15:14.496 --> 15:16.040
you need to eat
a squirrel.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.585
Well now, kids,
now we get to fun part.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.670
>> Yeah, this is
the fun part all right.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.339
You can tell a lot
about a man and woman

15:23.339 --> 15:25.716
on how they clean
their game.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.843
This is marriage
building 101.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.345
>> The couple who
skins together,

15:29.345 --> 15:31.430
stays together.
Don't forget that.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.015
Hold those legs there,
John Luke.

15:33.015 --> 15:33.891
>> Got it.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.685
- >> Starting in here...
- Ew.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.062
>> You wanna hold him?
>> No.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.396
>> Okay.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.440
>> This is something
I definitely think we'll

15:41.440 --> 15:43.609
make when we go
back to college.

15:43.609 --> 15:44.526
Right?

15:44.526 --> 15:45.694
>> Nope.

15:45.694 --> 15:46.904
>> No?
>> No.

15:46.904 --> 15:47.655
See right here,

15:47.655 --> 15:48.572
put your foot
right there.

15:48.572 --> 15:49.657
>> Whoa-oh.
>> Uh-oh.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.532
>> What?

15:50.532 --> 15:51.575
You just pulled
him in half.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.493
>> Doesn't this make
you wanna

15:52.493 --> 15:53.661
eat good squirrel?

15:53.661 --> 15:54.328
>> Mmm-Hmm.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.581
>> My squirrel killing
days are done.

15:57.581 --> 15:58.499
>> I'll kill them.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.125
>> I'm not gonna
clean them.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.502
I'm done with
that too.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.170
Mare Kate,
step on his tail.

16:03.170 --> 16:03.962
All right, come on
up with him.

16:03.962 --> 16:04.963
There you are.
Come on.

16:04.963 --> 16:06.131
Get rough with him.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.007
You just about
got him.

16:07.007 --> 16:07.800
>> I'm scared it's
gonna come

16:07.800 --> 16:08.967
up in my face.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.386
>> Ah, you'll gag
a couple times

16:10.386 --> 16:11.595
and then you'll be
all right.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.138
>> This is why
we come home.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.348
For this kind
of food.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.975
>> Hmm.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.394
>> There's your nice
squirrel meat,

16:18.394 --> 16:19.311
ready to go.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.354
Wow.
That's disgusting.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.313
All right,

16:21.313 --> 16:22.231
we gotta get ready
for the party.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.524
We will see you
all there.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.858
You might wanna
take you a shower

16:24.858 --> 16:25.943
before ya'll show up.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.986
Between the perfume
and the squirrel guts...

16:27.986 --> 16:29.488
People
who kill squirrels together,

16:29.488 --> 16:30.489
stay together.

16:30.489 --> 16:31.740
>> Now it just looks
kinda like chicken.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.617
>> You know what
you call what you just did?

16:33.617 --> 16:35.160
>> What do you
call it?

16:35.160 --> 16:35.994
>> You call it supper.

16:35.994 --> 16:36.995
>> Hmm.
Supper.

16:36.995 --> 16:38.664
>> Bring 'em inside,
and we'll have some

16:38.664 --> 16:40.290
good squirrel
and dumplings.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.125
>> Okay.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.334
The yuppies
are learning.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.297
Miss Kay learned this

16:47.297 --> 16:48.215
from her
grandmother.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.174
>> I did.
>> Aww.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.092
>> Fifty years ago.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.136
She's been making
them ever since.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.721
Now she's teaching you.

16:53.721 --> 16:54.888
Now,
I wanna tell you,

16:54.888 --> 16:56.098
it's gonna get messy.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.850
But of course,
a god cook doesn't

16:57.850 --> 16:59.184
care if it's messy.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.102
>> Mmm Hmm.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.395
>> Phil wants me
to let Mary Kate and

17:01.395 --> 17:03.856
John Luke cook these
squirrel dumplings

17:03.856 --> 17:05.524
all by there selves.

17:05.524 --> 17:08.277
But I think that
shipped sail when

17:08.277 --> 17:10.154
they started eating
like rabbits.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.489
I'm kinda making a big ol'
mess but who cares.

17:12.489 --> 17:13.615
>> Now don't do
too much, Kay,

17:13.615 --> 17:14.700
let them do it.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.826
>> This is really fun.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.703
Just scrape those fingers
right through it.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.662
>> Now let them
do it.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.372
>> Take the buttermilk,
shake, shake.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.665
You always shake
the buttermilk.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.416
You have to shake it.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.333
>> Let her do it.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.418
>> Well, let me just
show her one.

17:24.418 --> 17:25.169
>> They're young,

17:25.169 --> 17:26.170
don't crowd 'em
too much.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.838
>> No matter who's
doing the cooking,

17:27.838 --> 17:31.008
I just hope John Luke
eats a bunch of it.

17:31.008 --> 17:34.511
He looks like Tom Hanks
in that movie Castaway.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.472
Sift it into the bowl
the best you can.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.931
It doesn't matter if
it falls out.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.016
>> What she's
saying is,

17:39.016 --> 17:40.184
speed it up a little
bit, honey.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.351
>> I didn't say that.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.686
>> Work the bottom.
Work the bottom.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.687
Work that bottom.

17:43.687 --> 17:44.897
>> Hey.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.190
>> Just throwing a
little advice.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.191
>> Bring in the sifter.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.525
>> Spread it evenly.
Evenly.

17:48.525 --> 17:50.194
>> Phil!

17:50.194 --> 17:51.195
>> There you are.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.362
>> It's too bad they
didn't have squirrel

17:52.362 --> 17:54.323
and dumplings
on that island,

17:54.323 --> 17:56.658
instead of that
stupid volleyball.

17:56.658 --> 17:57.993
I think it's ready.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.495
>> I'll be ya'll
taste tester.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.371
>> I will be
the server.

18:01.371 --> 18:02.331
>> Not too much.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.999
>> Like you're not
going to like my food.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.000
Are you crazy?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.502
>> No, this is Mary Kate's
doing, honey.

18:06.502 --> 18:07.669
>> I think you'll
like it.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.671
I mean, I was supervised
by Memaw Kay.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.632
>> So lets see what
you got here, Mary Kate.

18:17.846 --> 18:18.889
>> Yay!

18:18.889 --> 18:19.765
>> Very good.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.225
>> I put a lot in
here because

18:21.225 --> 18:22.684
you need a lot
to eat.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.228
>> He needs to double
up on that gluten.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.437
Oh Mary Kate,

18:25.437 --> 18:26.605
you can't eat it.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.065
Nope.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.483
In fact,
there's enough gluten

18:29.483 --> 18:32.653
in this to blow the
roof off the joint.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.780
Sadie Robertson.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.323
Cole Robertson.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.908
The class of 2016.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.539
How you doing?

18:43.539 --> 18:44.748
I think I'm
gonna push harder

18:44.748 --> 18:45.666
on this ULM thing.

18:45.666 --> 18:46.750
>> Willie?

18:46.750 --> 18:47.751
>> She's just not
getting it.

18:47.751 --> 18:48.585
>> Okay.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.045
I don't think this
is about ULM.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.338
You just don't want
her to leave home,

18:51.338 --> 18:52.172
do you?

18:52.172 --> 18:53.340
>> It's a great school.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.216
>> And it happens
to be ten minutes

18:54.216 --> 18:55.300
from our house.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.679
>> Well, I'm not a big
planner guy

18:58.679 --> 19:01.056
so I try not to lay
out what someone

19:01.056 --> 19:02.140
else should do.

19:02.140 --> 19:04.726
I feel like they got to
walk that road, so uh-

19:04.726 --> 19:06.019
>> Are you kidding?

19:06.019 --> 19:06.770
You've been pushing
for her to go

19:06.770 --> 19:07.980
to ULM this
whole time.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.731
>> I just want her to
have the option to go.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.316
This wasn't as hard
with John Luke.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.192
>> He's a boy.

19:12.192 --> 19:13.652
It's hard to let your
little girl go.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.653
>> All right,
maybe I'll try

19:14.653 --> 19:16.154
reverse psychology.

19:16.154 --> 19:17.072
I'll say I don't care.

19:17.072 --> 19:18.282
You can do whatever
you wanna do.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.241
>> Okay.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.492
>> Well, there's a
bunch of reasons why

19:20.492 --> 19:21.660
I would like her
to stay here,

19:21.660 --> 19:22.661
because you know,

19:22.661 --> 19:24.246
I could just keep
giving her advice

19:24.246 --> 19:25.539
and keep an
eye on her.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.332
If she's dating,
I can be right there,

19:27.332 --> 19:29.042
no matter who it is-
>> Oh my.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.168
>> And where it is
at all times.

19:30.168 --> 19:31.545
>> Sadie has a good
head on her shoulders.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.046
We are not worried
about her.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.048
Where ever she goes,
she's gonna do great.

19:35.048 --> 19:36.800
>> We have one
little surprise.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.051
Look this way.

19:38.051 --> 19:41.263
The anticipation
is mounting.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.185
>> It be interesting
to see what Sadie

19:47.185 --> 19:48.228
decides to do.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.688
>> I'm not worried.

19:49.688 --> 19:50.647
She'll figure it out.

19:50.647 --> 19:51.857
>>Yup.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.650
We're glad
everyone's here.

19:53.650 --> 19:54.651
It's just
great to have all of

19:54.651 --> 19:57.154
our family and friends
around to celebrate.

19:57.154 --> 20:00.490
I'm so happy and I'm
so proud of Cole

20:00.490 --> 20:01.783
and the man
he's become.

20:01.783 --> 20:04.328
And just the character
that he has.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.704
>> We love you and
we're proud of you.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.750
Sadie teaches
me things,

20:09.750 --> 20:11.877
she takes care of her
friends and her family,

20:11.877 --> 20:13.545
and watches out
for everybody

20:13.545 --> 20:15.339
and she loves God
with all her heart.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.214
Proud of you.

20:16.214 --> 20:17.716
Aw,
thank you, mama.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.384
So Sadie,
you've been a true joy,

20:19.384 --> 20:21.178
and while we will
surely miss you when

20:21.178 --> 20:23.180
move on to
different things,

20:23.180 --> 20:25.974
we can't wait to see
what you're going to do.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.518
So keep doing that.
Love you.

20:28.518 --> 20:30.854
Aw,
I love you too.

20:30.854 --> 20:33.523
Father, I thank you
for these grandkids.

20:33.523 --> 20:36.568
I pray Father you bless
'em in everything they do.

20:36.568 --> 20:39.196
And may they set their
sights high.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.697
In the name of Jesus,
I pray.

20:40.697 --> 20:41.657
Amen.

20:41.657 --> 20:42.783
Amen.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.160
>> All right boys, lets get
in on this crawfish.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.495
Being a
parent is one of the

20:46.495 --> 20:48.205
most challenging,
yet rewarding jobs

20:48.205 --> 20:49.915
a person could have.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.333
The hardest part
is accepting that

20:51.333 --> 20:52.376
fact that one day,

20:52.376 --> 20:53.752
you'll have to let
them go.

20:53.752 --> 20:56.004
While part of our job
is to encourage them

20:56.004 --> 20:58.340
to follow their dreams,
sometimes it's easy

20:58.340 --> 21:00.842
to mistake their
dreams for your own.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.678
I guess the lesson
for parents here is,

21:02.678 --> 21:05.055
rather than focusing
on what you want

21:05.055 --> 21:06.848
your children to do
when they grow up,

21:06.848 --> 21:09.434
focus on the person you
want them to become.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.560
You think Phill let

21:10.560 --> 21:12.437
us keep
the perfume?

21:12.437 --> 21:13.522
I kind of like it.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.357
On me
or on you?
