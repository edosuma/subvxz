02:46.633 --> 02:48.935
- Ew, don't even bring
that dude up okay.

02:48.968 --> 02:51.638
Cory Terence is brody as
fuck so just stop please,

02:51.671 --> 02:53.306
before I throw up.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.307
- I thought you were like

02:54.340 --> 02:55.275
his secret lover.

02:55.308 --> 02:58.478
- Yeah right he wishes
I was his secret lover.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.713
He probably has a shrine of
me or some shit in his room.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.482
- You don't
feel a little bad

03:02.515 --> 03:03.449
for the guy?

03:03.483 --> 03:05.485
- Why should I feel bad?

03:05.518 --> 03:07.587
All I said to the guy
was fuck off and die,

03:07.620 --> 03:09.455
at least now he
might get the point.

03:09.489 --> 03:10.657
- I don't know,

03:10.690 --> 03:12.692
he's probably still
madly in love with you.

03:12.725 --> 03:16.663
Even if you did totally embarrass
the fuck out of him today.

03:16.696 --> 03:20.033
- Whatever, he totally
embarrassed himself.

03:20.066 --> 03:21.234
Anyway, I thought we were
talking about cute guys,

03:21.267 --> 03:24.737
not Cory Terence, you're totally
killing my boner right now.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.673
- Morgan I heard that, get
off the phone right now.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.508
- Do you
ever knock or what?

03:28.541 --> 03:30.944
- Not in my own house
I don't, now get off.

03:30.977 --> 03:32.478
- Daddy it's Gina Rice.

03:32.512 --> 03:36.616
- I don't care if it's
Jesus Christ, hang it up.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.651
- Hey boo, I gotta go, my
dad just rolled in here

03:38.685 --> 03:40.420
like the fucking cavalry.

03:40.453 --> 03:41.354
- OMG.

03:41.387 --> 03:42.322
- Yeah I'll call you later.

03:42.355 --> 03:43.590
- No you won't.

03:43.623 --> 03:44.857
- What is your deal?

03:44.891 --> 03:46.526
- The deal is you're
grounded young lady,

03:46.559 --> 03:48.628
now what is it about that
you don't seem to understand.

03:48.661 --> 03:50.496
- I understand fine
okay, don't treat me

03:50.530 --> 03:51.698
like I'm fucking five.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.534
- Then don't act like it, and
watch your language alright.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.469
At your age if I was
to cuss at my dad,

03:56.502 --> 03:58.338
the way that you do he'd
have beat the shit out of me.

03:58.371 --> 04:00.306
- That's because he was a
manic depressive alcoholic.

04:00.340 --> 04:03.610
- Enough, no more of this
smart ass shit, alright.

04:03.643 --> 04:06.713
- Alright, jeese Louise,
talk about cussing

04:06.746 --> 04:08.681
you should wash your
mouth out with soap.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.851
- Oh Morgan, I don't know
what I'm gonna do with you.

04:11.884 --> 04:14.854
- Well you could start
with ungrounding me.

04:14.887 --> 04:16.822
- Yeah I don't think so.

04:16.856 --> 04:18.358
- This is so not fair.

04:18.391 --> 04:19.959
- No, what's unfair is
what I caught you doing

04:19.993 --> 04:21.661
in my house while I was gone.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.896
And if your mother was alive
she'd say the same thing.

04:25.498 --> 04:27.900
- Well she's not, so don't
rub that one in my face okay.

04:29.902 --> 04:32.572
- Look, I'm running
late enough as it is,

04:32.605 --> 04:33.806
what I need for you to do--

04:33.840 --> 04:34.941
- Where are you going?

04:34.974 --> 04:36.609
- Out, to dinner.

04:36.643 --> 04:37.610
- With who?

04:37.644 --> 04:38.611
- Who do you think?

04:38.645 --> 04:39.646
- Not Brynn.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.014
- Yes of course Brynn.

04:41.047 --> 04:42.682
- Oh gag me.

04:42.715 --> 04:43.383
- I don't understand you Morgan,

04:43.416 --> 04:44.851
what is your problem with her?

04:44.884 --> 04:46.552
- Nothing except for
the fact that she's

04:46.586 --> 04:49.422
a steaming pile of bitch,
she's totally fake.

04:49.455 --> 04:50.657
- Well like it or not honey,

04:50.690 --> 04:51.791
that fake pile of
bitch just might be

04:51.824 --> 04:53.059
your stepmother one day.

04:53.092 --> 04:54.861
- And I will fling
myself off the balcony,

04:54.894 --> 04:56.396
I swear I'll do it.

04:56.429 --> 04:57.563
- I don't have time for
this, I've gotta go.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.532
Did you give Grandma
her pills yet?

05:01.401 --> 05:02.568
- I'm sorry.

05:02.602 --> 05:03.803
- Sweetheart, I've told
you a million times,

05:03.836 --> 05:05.672
it's imperative she
take those pills.

05:05.705 --> 05:06.939
- Where the hell is Derosa?

05:06.973 --> 05:08.141
- I gave her the weekend off,

05:08.174 --> 05:10.576
besides it's not her
job to take care of her.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.111
- Why all of a sudden
is it my responsibility?

05:12.145 --> 05:15.048
Can we not like hire
somebody to take care of her?

05:15.081 --> 05:16.616
- Do you want to pay for it?

05:17.784 --> 05:18.685
I didn't think so.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.788
Now look I'm gonna be
gone til about midnight,

05:21.821 --> 05:24.691
so be sure to take real good
care of Grandma alright.

05:24.724 --> 05:27.093
- Fine, you're gonna
be late for Brynn.

05:32.198 --> 05:35.702
- Oh and no boys
Morgan, I mean it.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.770
I better not catch that
little boy toy of yours

05:37.804 --> 05:39.972
creeping around my
house anymore, we clear.

05:41.207 --> 05:43.409
- Totes daddy, better go now,

05:43.443 --> 05:45.445
don't wanna keep
Miss Brynn waiting.

10:03.869 --> 10:05.871
- David McKenzie's office.

10:09.809 --> 10:10.443
Hello.

10:17.249 --> 10:18.317
Can I help you?

10:30.196 --> 10:31.197
Who is this?

10:49.181 --> 10:50.416
My fucking God.

10:54.153 --> 10:54.954
Shit.

13:09.355 --> 13:12.191
You're gonna catch
a cold Grandma.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.320
Grandma?

13:50.663 --> 13:54.166
I forgot to give you
your pills I know,

13:54.200 --> 13:57.303
but I'm gonna bring
them to you okay.

14:09.615 --> 14:13.285
- I can already feel my
insides failing me now.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.294
- Your pills are gonna make
you feel better Grandma,

14:22.328 --> 14:24.663
but you gotta eat something
before I can give them to you.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.307
- I heard a phone
ringing downstairs.

14:35.341 --> 14:38.477
- I know I'm sorry, I
don't know who it was.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.957
So, did you want something?

14:51.991 --> 14:56.562
- I want some soup,
some cheese dip soup.

14:59.365 --> 15:00.032
- Cheese dip soup?

15:00.065 --> 15:03.435
- Something hot, something wet.

15:07.506 --> 15:11.110
My colon feels like
it's all blocked up.

15:11.143 --> 15:12.578
- I don't know if we
have any such thing

15:12.611 --> 15:15.314
as cheese dip soup Grandma,

15:15.347 --> 15:17.449
even if we did I don't think
it's gonna help your colon any.

15:17.483 --> 15:21.387
- You just make it for me,
and fix me some coffee too

15:21.420 --> 15:23.055
while you're at it.

15:23.088 --> 15:27.226
- Fine, I'll do it but
before you get any sicker

15:27.259 --> 15:28.160
you may want to think about

15:28.193 --> 15:29.428
putting some clothes on Grandma.

15:30.796 --> 15:34.767
- You should think about
putting on more clothes dear.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.001
- Grandma what are you doing?

15:36.035 --> 15:38.304
- You're not still dressing up
like a little harlot are yah?

15:38.337 --> 15:39.405
- Let me go.

15:39.438 --> 15:42.574
- Harlot, she brings nothing
but chaos and disorder,

15:42.608 --> 15:45.444
she carries it like a plague.

15:45.477 --> 15:46.312
- Let go!

15:49.415 --> 15:52.551
I have to go get the soup
and the coffee too remember.

15:56.155 --> 15:58.057
- Make it fast dear.

16:00.359 --> 16:04.163
It gets so lonely up here,
so dreadfully lonely.

16:29.421 --> 16:33.792
You hurry back now dear,
I'll be waiting for you.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.030
I always do.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.539
- Morgan
you've been a bad girl,

16:47.573 --> 16:48.407
bad girl.

17:03.422 --> 17:04.256
Morgan.

19:17.356 --> 19:18.390
- Hello, who is this?

19:23.028 --> 19:25.631
- Oh that's it.

19:28.567 --> 19:29.401
Oh.

19:32.571 --> 19:33.605
- What?

19:34.606 --> 19:38.677
- Ask me
again, I wanna hear you.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.920
- I'm hanging up right now.

19:47.953 --> 19:51.623
- Oh God,
when you talk, I love it.

19:54.693 --> 19:58.897
Gonna be together, you
and me, close together.

20:02.301 --> 20:05.637
- Hey listen to me you have
the wrong fucking number okay.

20:07.773 --> 20:10.342
- Oh
fuck, that's it's Morgan,

20:10.375 --> 20:12.377
that's it baby, tell me.

20:13.612 --> 20:17.649
Oh I want you to feel this,
I know you can feel this.

20:20.519 --> 20:21.887
You're little this.

21:55.113 --> 21:56.782
- Morgan!

22:04.623 --> 22:05.957
- Mother you're dead.

22:08.960 --> 22:13.799
- I'm here
all the time with you,

22:13.832 --> 22:18.570
with daddy, with Grandma
upstairs, everywhere.

22:22.741 --> 22:25.577
Forever and always.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.452
- Please don't do this to me.

22:33.485 --> 22:36.955
- Oh honey, I'm
afraid you do this to yourself.

22:39.157 --> 22:43.495
- Stop it, you've been
dead for over a year now.

22:43.528 --> 22:46.131
- Why do
you keep saying that?

22:46.164 --> 22:48.166
I could never leave you.

22:50.635 --> 22:51.436
Never.

22:52.904 --> 22:55.140
- But you did, you're dead.

22:56.942 --> 22:58.443
Just talk to me.

23:01.513 --> 23:05.517
I want to know what
happened by the pool mother.

23:07.619 --> 23:08.453
Wait.

25:10.909 --> 25:12.878
Grandma where you at?

25:25.257 --> 25:30.262
- I'm here all
the time.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.915
- What are you
frightened of dear?

25:51.049 --> 25:54.953
- Nothing I just, I saw
the window was open,

25:55.887 --> 25:56.755
I don't know.

25:56.788 --> 25:59.925
- Did you think I
jumped out?

26:02.027 --> 26:03.728
- What were you doing Grandma?

26:04.896 --> 26:08.733
- Well I had to go really bad.

26:08.767 --> 26:09.935
- That is disgusting.

26:09.968 --> 26:13.672
- I got tired of ringing the
bell, I had to go, so I went.

26:13.705 --> 26:15.173
- I didn't hear
you ring the bell.

26:15.206 --> 26:18.343
- I rung it for a
long, long time.

26:18.376 --> 26:20.946
- Mother fucking smoke
alarm, I swear to God.

26:20.979 --> 26:25.083
- You really ought to come
quick when I ring the bell hun.

26:25.116 --> 26:27.319
- I told you I
didn't hear a bell.

26:27.352 --> 26:29.154
I was making God
damn cheese dip soup,

26:29.187 --> 26:30.288
whatever the fuck that is,

26:30.322 --> 26:31.957
I fucked it up the first time,

26:31.990 --> 26:35.226
so I had to make it the second
time, and now it's ruined.

26:35.260 --> 26:38.697
- No it isn't dear, it's
not, not yet it's not.

26:38.730 --> 26:42.000
- Yes it is, everything
is so fucked right now.

26:42.033 --> 26:46.204
- Oh no, everything's
fine dear, you'll see.

26:46.237 --> 26:51.142
Look let me just show you
here, it's gonna be okay.

26:52.944 --> 26:53.778
Look.

26:55.981 --> 26:58.316
- Grandma what are
you doing, stop.

27:00.218 --> 27:03.688
- You see, you see
it's good, it's fine.

27:03.722 --> 27:06.691
I'm eating it, nothing's
gonna be ruined.

27:11.062 --> 27:14.733
- Fine, just stay down
there for all I care,

27:15.834 --> 27:17.669
I've gotta get something
to clean this up.

27:18.737 --> 27:20.338
- It aint as bad as it seems.

27:27.312 --> 27:30.348
- Whatever, just promise
me for the love of God,

27:30.382 --> 27:33.785
you're not gonna lap up what's
in the closet over there.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.869
- Eat what's in the
closet, honestly.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.142
- Is everything good
here Mr McKenzie?

28:32.177 --> 28:33.945
- Wonderful
Alexandra, thank you.

28:41.219 --> 28:44.389
- Excuse me, this
sushi tastes like

28:44.422 --> 28:49.327
a bottom feeding cat fish,
get it out of here please.

28:51.529 --> 28:53.198
And bring us another
bottle of wine

28:53.231 --> 28:54.165
whenever you can fit it in.

28:54.199 --> 28:57.469
- Absolutely ma'am, I
am so sorry about that.

28:57.502 --> 28:58.770
- Don't apologize.

29:00.972 --> 29:02.974
- Is there anything else
I can get for you sir?

29:03.007 --> 29:03.842
- We're fine.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.183
As many times as
we've come here,

29:12.217 --> 29:15.120
you would think that they would
not forget the bloody wine.

29:15.153 --> 29:18.189
- I know, I know,
look sweetheart

29:18.223 --> 29:20.525
is everything alright, you
seem a little agitated?

29:22.961 --> 29:27.232
- It's nothing,
sometimes I just wish

29:27.265 --> 29:30.869
my God damn it's husband
would go ahead and croak

29:30.902 --> 29:32.103
the bastard.

29:32.137 --> 29:33.905
- Oh no, what did
he do this time?

29:33.938 --> 29:36.407
- Well the son of a bitch
is trying to hit me up again

29:36.441 --> 29:39.444
for more child support, as if
he hadn't already bled me dry.

29:40.879 --> 29:41.980
Are we allowed to smoke in here?

29:42.013 --> 29:43.248
- Of course not, come on.

29:44.182 --> 29:45.049
- Oh Preston's throne.

29:45.083 --> 29:46.384
- I don't see why you
don't just go ahead

29:46.417 --> 29:47.986
and fight for full custody.

29:49.154 --> 29:51.122
- Have you ever met
my daughter David?

29:52.257 --> 29:54.092
The little heathen
doesn't deserve a mother.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.227
- Oh come on Brynn, every
girl deserves a mother.

29:56.261 --> 29:59.063
Shit, as spoiled
as my daughter is,

29:59.097 --> 30:01.332
she sure could use a
mothers influence right now.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.435
- You don't think
you can handle her?

30:04.469 --> 30:06.271
- No I do, it's just
she doesn't ever want

30:06.304 --> 30:07.872
to listen to me.

30:07.906 --> 30:09.107
- So I've heard.

30:11.342 --> 30:14.012
- You know when Diana was alive,

30:14.045 --> 30:15.847
Morgan used to do
everything I said,

30:17.048 --> 30:18.449
or everything she said at least.

30:20.251 --> 30:23.121
I don't know things were
just different back then.

30:23.154 --> 30:26.024
- She might just need
to face the facts David,

30:26.057 --> 30:29.527
that your wife is dead,
and she's going to have

30:29.561 --> 30:31.863
to start facing the
future very soon.

30:33.298 --> 30:34.332
It can be frightening for
young girls at her age,

30:34.365 --> 30:38.036
but also very necessary.

30:38.069 --> 30:40.638
- Yeah, she just lacks guidance.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.575
- I think it's discipline she
lacks David, not guidance.

30:43.608 --> 30:47.011
I mean let's face it,
she continues to act out

30:47.045 --> 30:49.647
without the slightest bit of
concern for the consequences.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.116
- She's just
confused, that's all.

30:52.150 --> 30:55.320
- Well I realize
she's your daughter,

30:55.353 --> 30:58.556
but I can't help but feel the
reason she's so wayward lately

30:58.590 --> 31:01.125
'cause you're not
seeing each other.

31:01.159 --> 31:03.161
- I think it's a lot
of things actually,

31:03.194 --> 31:05.163
but you know, tonight
I came out and told her

31:05.196 --> 31:08.366
I was taking you out to
dinner, no if, in's or buts.

31:08.399 --> 31:10.501
- And what did she
have to say about that?

31:10.535 --> 31:12.270
- I think she was okay with it.

31:12.303 --> 31:14.472
Actually I think she's starting
to get used to the idea

31:14.505 --> 31:16.174
of you being around a lot more.

31:16.207 --> 31:20.111
- Well good, because I told
the little darling one day

31:20.144 --> 31:24.082
that I was going to be a
very huge part of her life,

31:24.115 --> 31:26.584
whether she liked it or not.

31:26.618 --> 31:29.354
You just have to be firm
with kids these days,

31:29.387 --> 31:30.588
as hard as it may seem.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.557
- You're absolutely
right, I feel like

31:32.590 --> 31:34.192
I've been laying down
the law a lot more

31:34.225 --> 31:35.193
though here lately.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.363
It's just she's so damn
bull headed sometimes.

31:39.597 --> 31:40.999
- She's like her father.

31:43.268 --> 31:45.203
In all seriousness though David,

31:45.236 --> 31:48.039
you've been extremely
lenient on her.

31:48.072 --> 31:50.375
You're much more
tolerant then I am.

31:50.408 --> 31:53.177
If it had been me who'd
caught my daughter

31:53.211 --> 31:55.980
going down on her
boyfriend in my Jacuzzi,

31:57.448 --> 32:00.385
well I probably would have
strangled her to death.

32:00.418 --> 32:03.621
- I know trust me,
I'm trying to get it

32:03.655 --> 32:05.556
all off my mind
right now you know.

32:05.590 --> 32:08.159
- Yes well I can imagine
a sight such as that,

32:08.192 --> 32:09.460
sticking in the
back of your mind.

32:09.494 --> 32:12.330
- Exactly, it's just weird.

32:12.363 --> 32:14.432
I mean every time I look at
her, that's all I see now,

32:14.465 --> 32:16.634
her doing that.

32:18.303 --> 32:23.308
- Hmm, in that case,
I might have an idea.

32:25.576 --> 32:28.980
Perhaps there's
something I could do

32:30.315 --> 32:33.318
to help you get it
out of your mind.

32:48.433 --> 32:49.400
- Shit.

32:55.373 --> 32:57.175
- Still thinking
about your daughter.

32:57.208 --> 32:58.176
- God no.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.312
- Good, because the only
thing in your mind right now

33:01.346 --> 33:04.816
should be me sucking the
life out of your cock.

33:04.849 --> 33:07.318
- I was gonna say
the same thing.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.322
- Relax, no more nasty thoughts

33:11.356 --> 33:14.092
about your dirty
little daughter.

33:15.393 --> 33:17.495
- Are we really doing
this, you're fucking nuts.

33:22.166 --> 33:27.071
- I'm just fucking crazy, but
that's what you love about me,

33:27.105 --> 33:28.239
isn't it?

33:28.272 --> 33:29.207
- Oh yeah.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.576
- Isn't it?
- Oh yeah.

33:31.609 --> 33:34.379
- Say it, I love crazy, say it.

33:39.350 --> 33:40.418
- I love crazy!

34:41.446 --> 34:42.713
- Oh my God!

35:13.744 --> 35:15.680
Robbie, what the fuck?

35:15.713 --> 35:18.316
What do you think you're doing,
creeping on me like that?

35:18.349 --> 35:20.618
- Oh you loved it
girl, don't even lie.

35:21.586 --> 35:23.421
Seeing what you
were doing there,

35:23.454 --> 35:24.922
having fantasies
about me or what?

35:24.956 --> 35:26.591
- Fuck no, get over yourself.

35:28.526 --> 35:29.660
- You look so fucking
hot right now.

35:29.694 --> 35:31.462
- Well you don't, so fuck off.

35:31.496 --> 35:34.899
- Damn you're in a weird
ass mood tonight aren't you.

35:34.932 --> 35:37.502
- You're the weird ass dude,
creeping on me like that.

35:37.535 --> 35:38.803
- I tried to call you like
a hundred fucking times,

35:38.836 --> 35:39.737
you didn't answer.

35:39.770 --> 35:41.506
- I know my dad has my phone.

35:42.740 --> 35:43.941
You better not have sent
me any nasty shit either,

35:43.975 --> 35:46.544
he's probably going
through it right now.

35:46.577 --> 35:48.312
- Got your ass on lock down huh?

35:48.346 --> 35:49.480
- Fuck yeah dude,

35:51.449 --> 35:53.518
while he goes out and
plays with his whore.

35:53.551 --> 35:54.719
- His whore?

35:54.752 --> 35:56.587
- He's got this bitch
girlfriend Brynn.

35:56.621 --> 35:59.624
I can't stand her arse,
and she totally knows it.

35:59.657 --> 36:00.958
She wants like all of his time.

36:01.959 --> 36:03.427
- Does this piss you off?

36:04.562 --> 36:06.564
- I mean not really,
I don't really

36:06.597 --> 36:08.566
give two shits
about what they do.

36:08.599 --> 36:11.502
- Good, you shouldn't,
'cause that gives more time

36:11.536 --> 36:13.504
for me and you.

36:13.538 --> 36:14.839
- You're such a weirdo.

36:14.872 --> 36:17.241
You're so not even supposed
to be here right now.

36:17.275 --> 36:18.509
If my dad knew you were here,

36:18.543 --> 36:20.678
he'd shoot your arse
right in your face.

36:21.913 --> 36:26.851
- Yeah well what daddy don't
know won't phase him, will it?

36:30.388 --> 36:31.656
- What are you doing?

36:31.689 --> 36:32.924
- Can I not get a kiss.

36:32.957 --> 36:35.026
- Seriously, I just
told you I got in

36:35.059 --> 36:36.460
an arse load of trouble for that

36:36.494 --> 36:37.595
and you're seriously
gonna ask me that.

36:37.628 --> 36:39.664
- So, what the fuck.

36:39.697 --> 36:40.998
- It just seems
like when we kiss

36:41.032 --> 36:42.600
it always leads to other stuff.

36:44.936 --> 36:46.904
Let's just smoke a bong.

36:46.938 --> 36:49.807
- Uh, man that's all
you ever want to do.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.542
- No it's not.

36:51.576 --> 36:54.679
- Bullshit, since always when
you're not passing out on me.

36:54.712 --> 36:56.547
- I'll have you know
sir that I only pass out

36:56.581 --> 36:58.316
when I'm drunk,
not when I'm high.

36:58.349 --> 36:59.050
- Oh is that right.

36:59.083 --> 37:00.518
- That's right God damn it.

37:01.519 --> 37:02.720
- Well look here
I aint gonna sit

37:02.753 --> 37:04.488
and argue with you
all night girl.

37:04.522 --> 37:07.525
If you wanna get fucking
high that's fine by me.

37:07.558 --> 37:09.794
You gotta smoke some
of what I brung though.

37:09.827 --> 37:11.395
- What'd you bring me?

37:11.429 --> 37:12.797
- You ever have Salvia.

37:14.432 --> 37:16.534
- Okay so I've never
actually smoked this before,

37:16.567 --> 37:18.703
but I've seen a lot
of videos on it.

37:18.736 --> 37:21.639
- Yeah I know, most of them
are pretty fucked up too.

37:23.007 --> 37:25.476
- I'm not gonna
like freak out am I?

37:26.410 --> 37:28.312
- Nah, you'll be good.

37:28.346 --> 37:29.714
You're just gonna see some
crazy shit for a while,

37:29.747 --> 37:31.716
but it only lasts
like five minutes.

37:32.850 --> 37:34.685
- I'm kinda nervous.

37:34.719 --> 37:36.053
- What, nervous?

37:36.087 --> 37:38.756
- I know, I mean usually I
handle my shit like a pro,

37:38.789 --> 37:42.526
but it's like I'm having a
panic attack for some reason.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.562
You may have to talk
me up a little bit.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.631
- No girl, you got this shit.

37:46.664 --> 37:48.933
Morgan I know aint
scared of nothing.

37:48.966 --> 37:49.867
- Fucking right.

37:49.900 --> 37:52.603
- You're like the drug queen.

37:52.637 --> 37:54.772
- I like your attitude sir.

37:54.805 --> 37:56.040
- So we doing this or what?

37:56.073 --> 37:58.609
- Oh my God, stop
peer pressuring me

37:58.643 --> 37:59.777
or I'm not gonna do it.

38:00.645 --> 38:01.746
Oh fuck.

38:01.779 --> 38:03.714
- What's wrong?
- Fucking brain freeze.

38:06.651 --> 38:09.487
- So you're trying to tell me
that the same bad ass bitch

38:09.520 --> 38:12.456
that punked out Cory Terence
in front of the whole school

38:12.490 --> 38:13.924
is afraid of a
little bit of Salvia.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.060
- Oh my God, speaking
of did I show you

38:16.093 --> 38:18.362
the love letter that pervo
left me the other day?

38:18.396 --> 38:21.799
- Nah, is this before or
after you went off on him.

38:21.832 --> 38:23.868
- After, he stuffed
it in my locker,

38:23.901 --> 38:26.570
that shit was sticky
and everything.

38:26.604 --> 38:27.905
Fucking lurker.

38:27.938 --> 38:30.374
- For real though, did
you read the letter yet?

38:30.408 --> 38:31.742
- Yeah dude.

38:31.776 --> 38:33.878
- And what'd it say?

38:33.911 --> 38:35.713
- I'll just let you
read it if you want,

38:35.746 --> 38:36.881
shit's pretty fucked up.

38:36.914 --> 38:39.517
- Hell yeah I wanna read that
shit, you got it with you?

38:39.550 --> 38:40.651
- Yeah come on.

38:52.730 --> 38:56.067
- No way, this dudes
a fucking Looney Tune.

38:58.703 --> 39:00.838
I like how he wrote
in blood red letters.

39:00.871 --> 39:04.041
- Ew, I don't,
fucking wigs me out.

39:04.075 --> 39:07.478
- My dearest Morgan, I sit
and look at you in Study Hall

39:07.511 --> 39:09.647
and I'm constantly
reminded of how much beauty

39:09.680 --> 39:12.783
there truly is in my
dark, lonely world.

39:12.817 --> 39:13.951
When I see your
silky blonde hair

39:13.984 --> 39:15.820
it brightens up my darkest day.

39:17.188 --> 39:20.157
I always think of a fire
burning in a snowy log cabin.

39:21.225 --> 39:22.126
Really?

39:22.159 --> 39:24.762
- Keep reading, it gets better.

39:24.795 --> 39:26.731
- Sometimes I just want
to hold onto you forever,

39:26.764 --> 39:28.899
and never let you go.

39:28.933 --> 39:30.801
I've thought of ways to
try to tell you this,

39:30.835 --> 39:32.970
but I don't want to come
off as some kind of jerk

39:33.003 --> 39:35.106
who doesn't know
what love really is.

39:36.741 --> 39:39.143
Does this dude want me to
pound his fat arse or what?

39:39.176 --> 39:41.612
- Read what it
says at the bottom.

39:41.645 --> 39:43.114
- I'm tired of always
trying to find ways

39:43.147 --> 39:44.949
to express myself to you.

39:44.982 --> 39:46.784
I feel like the reason
you always avoid me

39:46.817 --> 39:49.520
is because deep down
you're afraid to confront

39:49.553 --> 39:50.921
your true feelings about me.

39:52.256 --> 39:54.492
I'm tired of this dude thinking
he's some kind of poet.

39:54.525 --> 39:56.026
That's what I'm tired of.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.629
- Read what he says at the
end, he's fucking psycho.

40:00.698 --> 40:03.901
- I feel like if you don't
go out with me real soon,

40:03.934 --> 40:06.971
I'm gonna have to explode, you
wouldn't want that would you?

40:08.773 --> 40:10.808
I feel I would
squeeze you so tight

40:10.841 --> 40:12.877
while you looked into my eyes,

40:12.910 --> 40:14.912
squeeze you tight
under the moonlight

40:14.945 --> 40:16.514
until you changed your mind.

40:17.681 --> 40:19.717
Under my control you
would finally find out

40:19.750 --> 40:21.585
what a great guy I truly am.

40:24.188 --> 40:26.557
You would definitely see
me as husband material,

40:26.590 --> 40:28.626
or at least I hope you would.

40:29.827 --> 40:32.997
Anyway, I hope you would
make up your mind real soon,

40:33.030 --> 40:35.633
whether or not you
want to be with me.

40:35.666 --> 40:38.836
After all, I would
seriously hate it

40:38.869 --> 40:43.574
if the only way we could be
together was if we die together.

40:44.842 --> 40:46.143
- Pretty fucked up right.

40:48.312 --> 40:50.748
- Has anyone else read this?

40:50.781 --> 40:51.949
- No, why?

40:55.753 --> 40:58.155
- There's a fucking
death threat girl.

40:58.189 --> 40:59.657
- What?

41:00.858 --> 41:03.561
- This mother fuckers
threatening your life, I know it.

41:03.594 --> 41:04.728
- Shut up.

41:04.762 --> 41:07.898
- Hell no, this shit's serious.

41:07.932 --> 41:09.533
That letter's got death
written all over it.

41:09.567 --> 41:11.902
- Dude, shut the fuck
up, it's not funny.

41:11.936 --> 41:13.103
- I'm not trying to be funny,

41:13.137 --> 41:15.239
that dudes got a serious
problem for real.

41:16.774 --> 41:18.108
Did you even read what he said?

41:20.077 --> 41:21.946
He said he wanted for you
and him to die together.

41:21.979 --> 41:24.715
- I know, I know what
the letter says okay,

41:24.748 --> 41:25.950
and if you're gonna keep
scaring me all night,

41:25.983 --> 41:28.853
you can leave the same
damn way you came in.

41:28.886 --> 41:33.891
- Look I'm just saying,
dudes nutty as fuck man.

41:34.959 --> 41:35.826
I wouldn't put shit past him.

41:35.860 --> 41:37.895
- Alright, okay, I'm over it.

41:37.928 --> 41:39.730
I'm done talking
about Cory Terence.

41:40.898 --> 41:42.066
- Well you can't just ignore
shit like that Morgan.

41:42.099 --> 41:43.901
- I'm not ignoring anything.

41:55.746 --> 41:56.547
Hello.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.149
Hello.

42:00.784 --> 42:04.288
- Perfect
puss, here kitty kitty,

42:04.321 --> 42:06.991
come for me.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.058
- Who is this.

42:09.693 --> 42:11.295
- I wanna be
so close to you right now.

42:11.328 --> 42:14.865
Just right up next to you.

42:14.899 --> 42:16.967
- Okay look here
fucker, you need to quit

42:17.001 --> 42:18.903
fucking around and
harassing me okay.

42:18.936 --> 42:20.137
- Who is that?

42:20.170 --> 42:21.805
- Some fucking loser,
keeps calling me,

42:21.839 --> 42:23.107
won't leave me alone.

42:23.140 --> 42:24.808
- What the fuck's he saying?

42:24.842 --> 42:27.077
Morgan, I wanna see

42:27.111 --> 42:30.080
how wet and juicy
you get for me.

42:31.382 --> 42:32.816
- What you just say chum.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.754
Who the fuck is this?

42:38.689 --> 42:40.291
Oh so now you're
not gonna say shit.

42:42.293 --> 42:43.794
Well if you dial
this number again man

42:43.827 --> 42:45.829
you're gonna get your
arse beat alright.

42:49.199 --> 42:49.800
- What'd he say?

42:51.769 --> 42:54.238
- Nothing, not a damn thing.

42:56.941 --> 42:58.175
Why don't you just take
that shit off the hook?

42:58.208 --> 43:00.077
- It's my dads work line.

43:00.110 --> 43:01.011
- Who gives a shit?

43:01.045 --> 43:03.380
- He does, he'd fucking kill me.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.015
- How many times has
this asshole called?

43:05.049 --> 43:07.117
- I don't know, it doesn't
really matter okay.

43:07.151 --> 43:08.953
It just fucking pisses me off,

43:08.986 --> 43:10.354
he's gotta know who I am too.

43:10.387 --> 43:11.789
- How'd you know that?

43:11.822 --> 43:12.923
- 'cause he knows
my dads work number

43:12.957 --> 43:14.658
and I heard him shouting my name

43:14.692 --> 43:15.926
while he was blowing his wad so.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.027
- No fucking way.

43:19.997 --> 43:21.231
Has any of it
occurred to you at all

43:21.265 --> 43:22.900
that it could possibly
be Cory Terence

43:22.933 --> 43:24.068
making all these calls?

43:24.101 --> 43:26.136
- Of course it has,
and maybe it is,

43:26.170 --> 43:28.038
but maybe I don't want to know.

43:28.072 --> 43:30.040
- What are you gonna do
if he keeps calling back?

43:33.077 --> 43:35.045
- Fuck it, he won't.

43:51.395 --> 43:55.899
- Seriously, I don't think
you're ready for this.

43:55.933 --> 43:57.868
- I don't think your
moms ready for this.

43:57.901 --> 43:59.103
- I'm about to smack
you in the face.

43:59.136 --> 44:00.771
- Good I like it rough.

44:02.172 --> 44:06.076
- You know what I like, I
like these luscious legs.

44:07.945 --> 44:09.113
These adorable little footsies.

44:09.146 --> 44:11.115
- Stop looking at my
feet you little weirdo.

44:11.148 --> 44:12.449
- How does that
make me a weirdo?

44:12.483 --> 44:14.018
- Uh you have a foot fetish.

44:14.051 --> 44:15.853
- I have a Morgan fetish.

44:15.886 --> 44:17.488
- Stop.
- What?

44:17.521 --> 44:20.257
- I already told you
you're not getting any.

44:20.290 --> 44:22.860
- You used to be fun man,
what happened to you?

44:22.893 --> 44:25.462
- I got grounded,
that's what happened.

44:25.496 --> 44:26.830
Give me the lighter.

44:26.864 --> 44:28.032
- You're gonna do it now.

44:28.065 --> 44:30.000
- Might as well, fuck it right.

44:31.168 --> 44:31.969
- I thought you were
gonna bitch out on me.

44:32.002 --> 44:33.404
- Well then you
thought like Ned,

44:33.437 --> 44:35.072
and Ned thought his
arse was his head.

44:44.882 --> 44:47.885
- Whoa nice, hold
it in, hold it in.

44:53.924 --> 44:58.028
Oh nice, that was a fucking
hit and a half right there.

44:58.062 --> 44:59.530
You feeling anything yet.

44:59.563 --> 45:03.067
- Uh uh.

45:03.100 --> 45:04.034
- You good?

45:05.235 --> 45:10.207
- Uh, I think so, I think,
maybe I'm starting to feel it.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.341
- Is it kicking in?

45:13.944 --> 45:14.745
- I think so.

45:25.355 --> 45:26.990
Well, well, well.

45:34.064 --> 45:36.533
- What is it?
- Your face, stop.

45:38.202 --> 45:39.236
- Stop what?

45:40.537 --> 45:42.239
- Whatever it is you're doing.

45:43.273 --> 45:44.541
I can't handle it right now.

45:46.944 --> 45:50.247
Oh my God, this is
like, I can't even say.

45:54.084 --> 45:54.918
- Say what?

45:59.256 --> 46:01.959
- Wait a second, you said.

46:07.097 --> 46:09.333
You're doing anything
straight right, right, right.

46:10.434 --> 46:12.035
- I told you to what?

46:12.069 --> 46:15.239
- Don't do this to
me, you said it.

46:15.272 --> 46:17.508
- I'm not doing
anything, I swear.

46:17.541 --> 46:20.177
You'll be good in five
minutes, trust me.

46:22.412 --> 46:25.182
- My legs are not
moving right now.

46:25.215 --> 46:28.218
- They're not, but they
look perfectly fine to me.

46:29.353 --> 46:31.021
- You don't feel
the way I'm feeling,

46:31.054 --> 46:35.325
it's like some of
this isn't even here.

46:35.359 --> 46:40.364
Just, I'm like seeing
everything in the wrong time.

46:42.966 --> 46:46.236
Oh I feel hot, I feel hot, hot.

46:46.270 --> 46:47.337
- You are hot.

46:50.274 --> 46:51.175
- I don't like this anymore.

46:51.208 --> 46:53.210
- Come on just relax.

46:55.145 --> 46:58.048
That's it, just take it all in.

46:58.081 --> 47:00.450
- It's like being swept up,

47:00.484 --> 47:03.153
like the way it's pulling me.

47:03.187 --> 47:05.255
- Oh yeah, let it take you.

47:07.324 --> 47:10.327
- I'm like turning like
part of this clock.

47:13.330 --> 47:16.099
Hold on, I don't feel it yet.

47:17.334 --> 47:20.304
No, I'm still part of something.

47:20.337 --> 47:23.307
- You're gonna be
fine, just lay back.

47:27.311 --> 47:29.313
- I've been here before.

47:30.681 --> 47:35.886
- Yeah, you have.

47:38.088 --> 47:39.256
Yeah you have.

48:14.491 --> 48:17.261
- Wait, stop it's not over yet.

48:19.429 --> 48:23.367
- Oh that's it baby, I
want you to feel this.

48:57.100 --> 48:59.369
- Do it Morgan, do it,

48:59.403 --> 49:01.471
lose it, explode, explode.

49:05.742 --> 49:08.378
Let it slip, let it all slip,

49:10.747 --> 49:15.752
it's real easy, feel
gone, show how it's done.

49:31.668 --> 49:34.738
- Stop, wait.

49:42.512 --> 49:44.181
Is this the present?

49:48.585 --> 49:49.453
- Morgan.

49:49.486 --> 49:51.288
Stop it's fine.
- Get off.

49:51.321 --> 49:52.556
- Morgan, you're gonna be fine.

49:52.589 --> 49:53.757
- No!

49:53.790 --> 49:57.260
- Just calm down,
you're gonna be okay.

50:26.390 --> 50:27.591
- Get the fuck off me.

50:29.192 --> 50:30.794
You knew exactly what the
fuck you were doing in there.

50:30.827 --> 50:32.362
- I didn't know you were
gonna freak out like that.

50:32.396 --> 50:34.798
- I'm not talking about
the Salvia, fucktard.

50:34.831 --> 50:36.233
I'm talking about you
and how you always

50:36.266 --> 50:37.534
take shit too far.

50:37.567 --> 50:38.769
- Well look you're the
one who wanted to try it,

50:38.802 --> 50:40.170
so don't blame this on me.

50:40.203 --> 50:41.438
- You still don't
understand what the fuck

50:41.471 --> 50:43.206
I'm talking about, do you.

50:43.240 --> 50:44.541
- I guess I don't.

50:44.574 --> 50:46.309
- In a nutshell genius, you
just took advantage of me

50:46.343 --> 50:48.445
and I don't fucking
play like that.

50:48.478 --> 50:51.148
- Come on Morgan, we've
done way worse then that,

50:51.181 --> 50:53.650
and you never said
shit about it before.

50:53.683 --> 50:55.419
- Maybe I'm just tired of
getting my arse chewed out

50:55.452 --> 50:56.453
because of you.

50:56.486 --> 50:57.687
- Because of me?

50:57.721 --> 51:00.757
- Yeah dingus, it's your fault
I'm on house arrest, remember

51:00.791 --> 51:03.693
it's because of you I
can't leave this dungeon.

51:03.727 --> 51:05.495
- You can keep blaming
me all you want,

51:05.529 --> 51:07.497
but I'm tired of
listening to it.

51:07.531 --> 51:09.599
- Of course you are,
couldn't give less of a shit

51:09.633 --> 51:11.468
about how badly my life
is fucked right now.

51:11.501 --> 51:12.702
- Oh how is your life fucked?

51:12.736 --> 51:14.604
- How is my life fucked?

51:14.638 --> 51:16.840
Let's count the ways, my
dad took away my Lexus,

51:16.873 --> 51:18.842
my tablet, my phone, my music,

51:18.875 --> 51:20.911
basically everything
that makes me me.

51:20.944 --> 51:22.879
- Well what the hell do you
want me to do about that?

51:22.913 --> 51:24.648
- I want you to stop
dragging me into shit,

51:24.681 --> 51:25.849
and coming over here thinking

51:25.882 --> 51:27.150
you're gonna get
something out of it.

51:27.184 --> 51:28.785
- I never dragged you into shit.

51:30.454 --> 51:32.722
- What did I say to you when
you first got here tonight?

51:34.458 --> 51:35.759
I told you you
weren't getting any,

51:35.792 --> 51:37.828
and that's exactly
what the fuck I meant.

51:41.431 --> 51:42.632
If you can't just
hang out and be cool,

51:42.666 --> 51:45.535
then maybe we shouldn't
hang out at all.

51:45.569 --> 51:47.604
- Jesus, what did you
have some kind of like

51:47.637 --> 51:50.240
religious experience
or something?

51:50.273 --> 51:54.411
- No, I'm just not gonna be
your fucking whore anymore.

51:56.513 --> 51:58.515
- You know this aint
like you Morgan.

52:00.417 --> 52:02.919
I don't know what it was I
did to piss you off so bad.

52:07.657 --> 52:11.628
But maybe it would be best
for the both of us if I left,

52:11.661 --> 52:13.296
is that really what you want?

52:16.733 --> 52:18.568
- Look, if you're gonna leave,

52:19.736 --> 52:20.937
would you at least
put the ladder back

52:20.971 --> 52:23.473
by the pool house
where you found it.

52:35.919 --> 52:37.354
- Fucking dyke.

52:41.591 --> 52:42.659
Fucking shit.

53:05.448 --> 53:06.616
Robbie.

53:12.489 --> 53:13.723
Robbie.

53:17.027 --> 53:17.861
- Hello.

53:19.930 --> 53:22.432
- Robbie.

53:23.366 --> 53:24.000
- Who's there?

53:25.068 --> 53:26.670
- Robbie come here.

53:29.639 --> 53:31.007
Robbie get in here.

53:34.511 --> 53:36.913
I've got something to show you.

53:38.515 --> 53:41.351
I have so much to
show you Robbie.

53:43.687 --> 53:47.290
That's it, that's it
Robbie, come closer.

53:51.995 --> 53:52.996
Yes, closer.

54:01.972 --> 54:03.773
Yes Robbie, closer.

55:19.849 --> 55:20.717
- Hello.

55:24.621 --> 55:27.090
What are you trying to do to me?

55:30.593 --> 55:31.394
Who is this?

55:33.063 --> 55:35.632
- You, it's
you you little sow.

55:35.665 --> 55:38.568
It's you I want to be
fucked too, not him.

55:38.601 --> 55:39.903
Make fuck to me right now.

55:40.837 --> 55:43.473
Listen to him die slow, loud.

55:48.812 --> 55:49.846
- Stop.

55:51.214 --> 55:53.750
Please stop calling me.

55:54.884 --> 55:55.719
Please.

56:00.924 --> 56:03.593
- I can
almost smell you now.

56:03.626 --> 56:05.762
I'm so close, close to you.

56:26.883 --> 56:28.084
- Hey honey.

56:28.118 --> 56:28.752
- Daddy.

56:31.087 --> 56:32.689
What time are you coming home?

56:33.857 --> 56:35.091
- In a
little while, why?

56:42.899 --> 56:44.868
- Morgan, sweetie what's wrong?

56:48.204 --> 56:51.608
A guy keeps calling and saying
all this horrible stuff.

56:52.942 --> 56:54.744
I don't know if it's
somebody that I know

56:54.778 --> 56:55.979
that's just messing with me.

56:57.147 --> 56:58.681
I just don't even
know what to do,

56:58.715 --> 57:00.016
I'm so fucking scared.

57:01.684 --> 57:02.886
I don't even know
why I'm calling you,

57:02.919 --> 57:04.954
I just feel like
I'm losing my mind.

57:04.988 --> 57:07.524
- Honey it's fine,
just calm down alright.

57:09.793 --> 57:12.862
What kind of stuff is
this guy saying to you?

57:14.564 --> 57:16.900
- He's making all these sounds,

57:16.933 --> 57:19.769
and doing weird
things to himself.

57:19.803 --> 57:22.939
- Sweetheart
listen, if anyone is calling

57:22.972 --> 57:24.641
and harassing you like
that it's mostly likely

57:24.674 --> 57:25.942
that boyfriend of yours.

57:28.745 --> 57:30.847
- Daddy you're not
listening to me.

57:30.880 --> 57:32.215
- Honey, I hear
you loud and clear,

57:32.248 --> 57:33.983
but you need to listen to me.

57:35.585 --> 57:37.787
That Robbie is up to
no good and I wouldn't

57:37.821 --> 57:39.088
put anything past him.

57:40.290 --> 57:41.991
Now I saw some of
the text messages

57:42.025 --> 57:43.626
he sent to your phone
and I couldn't believe

57:43.660 --> 57:45.195
some of the stuff I read.

57:46.963 --> 57:49.098
- You went through my phone?

57:49.132 --> 57:51.835
- That's right and it's
a good thing I did.

57:51.868 --> 57:53.703
I finally found out
what kind of boy

57:53.736 --> 57:55.271
my daughter associates
with so that I can

57:55.305 --> 57:56.573
put a stop to it.

57:57.974 --> 57:59.709
And don't think I didn't
see all those dirty pictures

57:59.742 --> 58:01.611
you two sent to
each other either.

58:01.644 --> 58:03.847
- Daddy you had no
right to do that.

58:03.880 --> 58:05.648
- I had every right
to do that young lady,

58:05.682 --> 58:07.917
I'm the one who pays that
phone bill, remember.

58:11.988 --> 58:13.756
So if some pervert
keeps calling you,

58:13.790 --> 58:16.059
being inappropriate
Morgan it's probably him.

58:17.660 --> 58:21.831
- It's not Robbie daddy, I
know for a fact that it's not.

58:21.865 --> 58:23.867
- Well what the hell
else am I supposed to believe

58:23.900 --> 58:25.735
after what I saw.

58:25.768 --> 58:28.104
Just seeing the two of you
together like that honey,

58:28.137 --> 58:29.973
I'm still in a state of shock.

59:17.086 --> 59:18.121
Shit.

59:29.165 --> 59:31.868
- For God sake
David, what is it?

59:34.203 --> 59:35.038
- It's nothing.

59:37.707 --> 59:39.943
Just don't have a very
good feeling right now.

59:41.010 --> 59:42.078
- About what?

59:42.979 --> 59:44.080
- About Morgan.

59:46.683 --> 59:48.151
- What are you trying to say?

59:49.152 --> 59:52.322
- I'm saying I think
we need to go back.

59:54.057 --> 59:57.894
- Go back, David are
you out of your mind,

59:57.927 --> 59:59.128
what about our tickets?

59:59.162 --> 01:00:01.097
- We can go to the opera
another night alright.

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:04.000
- Listen to what you're saying,

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:05.401
we drove all the way
out here and you just

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:08.338
want to turn around and go back.

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:13.242
David, let's no go
back, let's not.

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:15.044
- I have to check
on Morgan Brynn,

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:16.980
I can't just let go.

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:18.715
God you don't understand.

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:23.786
- I understand that this
infatuation with your daughter

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:28.224
is becoming extremely unhealthy,
that's what I understand.

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:29.459
- Look we're going back

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:30.893
and that's all there
is to it alright.

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:32.295
I don't care what
you have to say.

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:02.725
- Grandma.

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:10.733
I'm coming in.

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:15.204
I have your medicine.

01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:29.919
Grandma did you hear me?

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:34.157
I have your pills.

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:44.033
Grandma?

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:15.398
- Quiet, get in here,
they're gonna come after us.

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:17.400
- Let go of me.

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:19.135
- Shut it you little shit,

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:22.538
they'll find you and they'll
swallow me and you too.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:24.273
- Grandma let go of my leg.

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:27.810
- I'm gonna bite you if you
don't join me in this child,

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:30.246
now get your skinny
arse in here.

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:38.287
The bastard death rats
they come and they go.

01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:41.057
All over the walls
they crawl, inside,

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:45.962
the rotten insides
they always hide.

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:47.230
- What are you talking about?

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:49.999
- You've got to keep
them out and fight,

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:52.034
if you don't you become.

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:55.271
I've seen things chewing on me,

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:58.975
I felt it, and I felt it.

01:02:59.008 --> 01:03:00.910
- Grandma please.

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:02.044
- Where are you going?

01:03:02.078 --> 01:03:03.346
- Your pills are by the door.

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:08.050
- No one leaves
heathen, you can't.

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:13.856
You stay put, don't you join
the fold by shutting your eyes.

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:17.059
You must keep them
open, you must.

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:18.361
- Grandma stop.

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:27.203
- Look at me, just see
what you make me do.

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:34.377
- Grandma stop, stop
doing this to yourself.

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:41.584
- Come to me, you
just come to me.

01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:53.095
You'll come back to me
soon dear, I know you will.

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:58.334
You always do and then
I'm gonna keep you

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:01.537
wrapped up in here with
me in the flesh forever.

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:06.275
I want you to
smell it like I do.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:13.382
Smell what it's like to
rot, you'll find out.

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:18.321
You'll find out.

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:45.441
- Morgan,
Morgan it's Barry.

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:48.678
- Who?

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:49.545
- Barry.

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:52.048
- I don't know a Barry.

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:54.417
- Yes you
do, Barry Cone,

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.352
I'm a close colleague
of your fathers.

01:05:58.354 --> 01:05:59.322
- What do you want?

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:01.590
- Look I know it's late

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.492
but I really need
to talk to your dad,

01:06:03.526 --> 01:06:05.361
it's very important.

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:08.331
- He's busy right now.

01:06:08.364 --> 01:06:10.533
- Yeah I know he's
still at the Opera with Brynn,

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:13.436
I talked to him just
a couple of hours ago.

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:15.137
- So what are you doing here?

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:18.374
- I was told to be
here as soon as he got back.

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:21.243
I guess I'm just early.

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:26.415
- Don't you drive
a black Mercedes?

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:29.352
- Yes, yes that's
right, see you know me.

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:32.588
- I just didn't see
it parked out front.

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:37.560
- That's because
that German piece of shit

01:06:37.593 --> 01:06:39.829
just up and died on me
about two miles up the road.

01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:41.163
I had to walk through this rain.

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:43.499
It just quit.

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:47.269
- So you need a tow
truck or something?

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:48.204
Do you not have a phone?

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:50.339
- No, no, no,
that's taken care of.

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:53.476
I was really just hoping
I could wait here for him.

01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:57.480
- So you decided to hike all
the way up here in this mess?

01:06:58.414 --> 01:06:59.215
Are you crazy?

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:03.719
- Would you believe I
ask myself that a lot lately.

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:09.492
No, if I'd have known that
it was gonna rain like this

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:11.694
I would have stayed
with the car I promise.

01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:15.531
- Yeah, sucks for you.

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:18.534
- Like you have no idea.

01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:23.572
Listen sweetie can I just come
inside for just one second,

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:25.808
I just need to dry off.

01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:28.177
This rain is really cold.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.622
- How did you know the code
to get through the gate?

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:51.500
- I don't know the
gate code, the gate's open.

01:07:56.205 --> 01:07:59.575
Morgan, I can
promise you that gate

01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:01.243
was wide open when I got here.

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:04.413
I don't have any reason
to lie about that.

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:13.556
Look I know it's late, and
I know you don't know me

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:15.724
that well and that
this probably sounds

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.359
like a whole bunch
of crap to you,

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:19.562
and it's good that
you're thinking that way.

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:23.599
- Then you can understand
why I can't let you in here.

01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:28.636
- Yeah.

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:31.540
Yeah,

01:08:31.573 --> 01:08:34.577
yeah I suppose I can understand
why you'd feel that way.

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:49.325
Listen, I'm gonna
go ahead and go,

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:55.698
and I'm sorry I scared
you Morgan okay.

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:58.600
Have a good night.

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:18.621
- Hey.

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:27.328
You're gonna drown out there.

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:41.743
- Thank you.

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:45.648
Oh man I'm getting
the floor all wet.

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:50.252
- It's fine, I was gonna
go get some towels anyway.

01:10:00.429 --> 01:10:03.599
- I'm really sorry about
dropping in on your like this.

01:10:04.633 --> 01:10:06.735
Must have scared the
crap out of you huh?

01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:11.540
- It's fine, been
jumpy all night anyway,

01:10:12.641 --> 01:10:14.410
the storm isn't really helping.

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:19.381
- Well, I mean it's
gotta be scary right,

01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:23.752
big house like this,
all by yourself.

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:29.792
- Yeah, I mean usually I
don't mind thunderstorms.

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:39.001
- Well, that's a hell
of a storm right.

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:43.973
- Yeah.

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:52.948
- Uh,

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:57.519
your dad doesn't still
have some of that

01:10:57.553 --> 01:11:01.490
really good brandy back
there anymore does he?

01:11:01.523 --> 01:11:04.994
- Um, I guess so.

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:09.632
- Well I don't mean to impose,

01:11:09.665 --> 01:11:12.568
but I could really
use a stiff drink

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:13.869
after being out in that shit.

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:22.778
What do you say kid, join
me for a stiff drink?

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:27.416
- I don't know, my
dad always gets on me

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:29.084
when I sneak that
shit from the bar.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.085
He can always tell.

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:41.063
- I won't tell
anybody if you won't.

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:21.070
- David this is Barry,
I'm at the house,

01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:24.506
so I will see you in just
a few minutes, thanks.

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:38.587
He has got to still
be at the opera.

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:47.663
Alright, post time come on.

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:50.999
- You do I'm underage right.

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:55.838
- I know you drink Morgan,

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:57.840
I used to watch you all
the time at your fathers

01:12:57.873 --> 01:13:01.910
cocktail parties when
you were like 15.

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:08.917
- You watched me.

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:12.554
- Yeah you used
to always sneak in

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:16.925
and steal all those wine
coolers that nobody else wanted.

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:19.995
- Guess I wasn't
sneaky about it.

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:27.536
Can I get some ice or
something for this?

01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:30.172
- You gotta be kidding me,
that's no way to drink brandy

01:13:30.205 --> 01:13:31.940
come on now.

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:33.809
- I know how to drink brandy.

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:44.153
- Ladies and gentlemen,
we've got a pro here.

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:51.226
I always thought
it was cute how you

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.761
used to always dip into
our punch bowl too.

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:54.830
- You thought I was cute.

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:55.697
- Yeah.

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:59.034
- You sure used to watch
me an awful lot didn't you.

01:13:59.067 --> 01:14:00.035
- Yeah.

01:14:02.905 --> 01:14:05.574
I mean, never in a weird way.

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:09.478
Just I was just perceptive.

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:13.582
- Yeah, sure.

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:17.586
- You were a cute little
thing back then too.

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:20.155
- Whatever, back then I was
a pudgy little hose bag,

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:22.224
who wore way too much eyeliner.

01:14:22.257 --> 01:14:24.960
- Nuh uh, I don't think that.

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:27.930
I don't think that at all.

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:33.001
Get you another drink
before your dad gets home.

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:37.039
- Do you like get off on
encouraging minors or something?

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:41.610
- Would you believe you're
the third one this week.

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:44.947
- I know one thing,
I'm not gonna be wasted

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:47.583
when my dad gets here,
that's the last thing I need.

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:50.786
- What are you doing?

01:14:52.588 --> 01:14:54.289
- You have another
shirt I can borrow?

01:14:55.924 --> 01:14:58.794
- I mean I'm sure my dad
does, but that's upstairs

01:14:58.827 --> 01:14:59.962
and fuck that shit.

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:03.699
- If any of this is
making you uncomfortable

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:05.767
in any way just let me know.

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:16.111
Come on Morgan,
we're just two people

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:22.117
having a casual conversation
over a harmless little drink.

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:30.025
- It's been a while
since I've had brandy.

01:15:30.058 --> 01:15:31.560
I should probably pace myself.

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:35.330
Nonsense, you're
only young once.

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:38.133
Come on kiddo, toss it back
rookie, you know what to do.

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:43.605
Dip into the punch bowl Morgan.

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:54.316
That a girl.

01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:01.957
- You know, speaking of
dipping into the punch bowl,

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:08.030
wasn't it you that used to
screw around with Brynn?

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:12.668
- What do you mean screw around?

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:16.138
- Seems like I can
remember seeing you two

01:16:16.171 --> 01:16:18.874
at the same type of parties
you guys would see me.

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:21.109
You guys would
always sneak around

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:22.644
and make out and
shit, the same way

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:24.112
I would sneak
those wine coolers.

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:29.084
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:33.021
- Yeah, yeah and my dad
would always be really busy

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:35.057
with clients and I
can remember you two

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:36.224
getting pretty friendly
with each other

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:38.660
now that I think about it.

01:16:41.797 --> 01:16:43.065
- You got some wild
imagination kid,

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:44.132
that's all I can say.

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:51.073
- You know, I don't even know
if my dad knew about that.

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:57.212
I bet you didn't even
know that I knew.

01:17:00.482 --> 01:17:03.819
- Morgan, what you're
saying right now

01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:06.421
has got to be the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:08.256
What in Gods name
makes you think

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:11.193
I've been getting frisky
with your fathers girlfriend?

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:14.162
- Because I watched you two.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.968
Not in like a weird
way or anything,

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:23.405
I was just being perceptive.

01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:32.748
Come on Barry, we're
just two people

01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:34.182
having a casual
conversation over

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:35.917
a harmless little drink right.

01:17:38.286 --> 01:17:41.256
Seriously dude you
can be honest with me,

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:44.226
I don't give a shit,
that's y'alls business.

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:48.397
I do have to admit that's
typical Brynn for you though.

01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:54.169
Tell me everything you know
about that shady bitch.

01:17:56.238 --> 01:18:00.275
I'm just curious, dip
into the punchbowl Barry.

01:18:17.826 --> 01:18:19.227
How's that for a punch bowl?

01:18:20.195 --> 01:18:21.196
Fucking cunt.

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.821
Wake up sweet girl.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.415
- Oh my God, what the fuck.

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:49.050
What the fuck are you doing?

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:54.022
- I'm getting things ready.

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:59.261
- Getting things ready for what?

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:07.435
- When your daddy gets home.

01:20:16.244 --> 01:20:17.445
- It was
you, wasn't it?

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:20.916
- It was me what?

01:20:23.218 --> 01:20:24.953
- You who
kept calling me.

01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:29.224
- I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about Morgan.

01:20:32.527 --> 01:20:33.461
Don't cry baby.

01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:42.003
- I don't know
what this is about,

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:44.406
but I'm sure I can work
something out with you okay.

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:59.955
- Sorry sweetie, see
you're not in any position

01:20:59.988 --> 01:21:01.089
to help me out at all.

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:07.362
Quite frankly, you're
a sitting duck.

01:21:09.264 --> 01:21:10.131
- Just let me go.

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:16.338
I don't know what the
fuck you want from me.

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:19.307
- This aint about
what I want from you.

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:21.443
This is about what
you're gonna do for me.

01:21:26.414 --> 01:21:28.116
- Do you know what
this is Morgan?

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:33.121
This is a little something
I like to call income tax.

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:39.127
- What is that, what does it do?

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.264
- Oh it's just gonna make
you feel really good,

01:21:44.699 --> 01:21:47.369
and by the time it's done
doing what it's supposed too

01:21:48.603 --> 01:21:50.171
you won't know what hit you.

01:21:54.609 --> 01:21:58.380
And I'm gonna be making love
to you the second you die.

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:01.516
And you're last breaths
gonna go into me

01:22:03.251 --> 01:22:04.386
and you'll be mine forever.

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:08.390
- You're not sticking
me with that thing.

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:11.226
- This aint the only thing
I'm sticking you with.

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:12.360
Besides I gotta make
it look for real

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:15.030
when your dad comes walking
through that door, don't I.

01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:18.500
- What the hell are
you talking about?

01:22:20.735 --> 01:22:24.439
- No offense, but given
the number of times

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:27.509
you've been into
and out of rehab

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:29.411
I don't think walking
through that door

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:31.413
and finding you
dead in this chair,

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:33.415
with this sticking
out of your arms

01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:34.616
gonna be too big of a shocker

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:36.718
if you catch what I'm saying.

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:38.219
- Just let me fucking go.

01:22:39.387 --> 01:22:41.389
You're not gonna
get away with this.

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:48.630
- When you let me in that door,
I kind of got away with it.

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:52.701
I've planned this
out to perfection.

01:22:56.671 --> 01:22:59.641
- If this is about money I
know I can talk to my dad

01:22:59.674 --> 01:23:01.609
as soon as he gets home okay.

01:23:07.582 --> 01:23:11.086
- I can't do that, because
I've gotta be done with you

01:23:11.119 --> 01:23:13.788
and out of here before your
dad even leaves that opera.

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:17.726
- Barry listen, I know
you don't want to do this.

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:26.167
- Morgan, I'm getting paid
a lot of money to do this.

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:30.839
But I need you to
understand something,

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:36.077
even if I weren't I really,
really want to do this.

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:44.519
What I want to do right
now is suck on that

01:23:44.552 --> 01:23:45.787
fucking tongue of yours.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:58.566
Have you ever
kissed a man before?

01:24:00.135 --> 01:24:03.505
Have you ever
kissed a man before?

01:24:05.473 --> 01:24:07.575
That's really fucking good
because if you don't do that

01:24:07.609 --> 01:24:08.777
this next time I'm
gonna put this needle

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:10.311
in your God dam eyes.

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.348
You got that?

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:17.285
Is there any part of that
you don't understand?

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:20.188
- No.

01:24:45.346 --> 01:24:47.348
- I've always loved you.

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:54.589
Ever since you
were a little girl.

01:25:01.396 --> 01:25:05.600
It's almost a shame I've
gotta do what I've gotta do.

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:08.503
- You don't have to,
you can just listen.

01:25:08.536 --> 01:25:10.705
We can work something out okay.

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:16.244
- As much as I'd love to
work something out with you,

01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:19.314
I've got business to attend too.

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:22.550
- Look, no we can
talk about this.

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:25.820
- We've wasted enough time.

01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:27.755
- I have to go
pee, if you'll just

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:29.324
let me out of this chair.

01:25:31.559 --> 01:25:33.728
- You can piss yourself
for all I care.

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:38.867
- Look, I'll let you
watch me while I go,

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:42.203
just let me go to
the bathroom please?

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:51.880
- What did you say to me?

01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:57.218
- I said you can watch
me go if you want.

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:02.490
I know you like me,
I know for a fact

01:26:02.524 --> 01:26:03.358
you think I'm pretty.

01:26:07.428 --> 01:26:08.963
- Aren't you a naughty girl.

01:26:11.399 --> 01:26:13.601
- Just let me go to
the bathroom okay.

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:18.373
Just let me go to the
bathroom and I'll pee for you.

01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:32.587
- Let's do this bitch.

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:42.964
Nice.

01:26:47.802 --> 01:26:49.237
Oh fuck.

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:56.010
God you're fucking hot.

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:57.712
- Yeah.

01:26:58.646 --> 01:27:01.316
- You want this don't you.

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:03.351
You want me to give
it to you don't yah?

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:05.787
God damn right you do.

01:27:07.355 --> 01:27:07.989
Call me daddy.

01:27:10.391 --> 01:27:12.794
I said call me
daddy little girl.

01:27:12.827 --> 01:27:13.761
- Yes daddy.

01:27:17.932 --> 01:27:20.602
- Take off your shirt,
let's see what you got.

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:29.377
Fuck, spread your legs.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.449
I said spread your
fucking legs little girl.

01:27:37.952 --> 01:27:42.724
Oh shit, oh fuck.

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:48.830
I'm gonna fuck the
shit out of you.

01:27:55.536 --> 01:27:56.838
Take off your bra.

01:27:58.373 --> 01:27:59.007
- Uh uh

01:28:00.408 --> 01:28:01.809
- I said take off
your fucking bra.

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:04.779
Oh mother fucker.

01:28:47.822 --> 01:28:51.859
- David, are you sure you
want to go inside right away?

01:28:51.893 --> 01:28:52.760
- What do you mean?

01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:55.430
- I can do all of
those things you know,

01:28:55.463 --> 01:28:58.800
all those kinky things you like.

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:00.702
There's plenty of room in here.

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:04.105
- Brynn please I have
a splitting headache,

01:29:04.138 --> 01:29:05.807
I'm not in the mood right now.

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:09.744
- Well at least
just give us a kiss.

01:29:09.777 --> 01:29:10.912
Just one kiss.

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:16.150
Dad.

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:17.051
- What the hell?

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:24.992
- Oh my lord.

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:26.961
- Morgan where are your clothes?

01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:31.866
Hey, I'm talking here
young lady, look at me.

01:29:31.899 --> 01:29:34.168
Why in God's name are
you half naked right now?

01:29:37.805 --> 01:29:40.641
He's here, isn't he, that
fucking Robbie is in there,

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:41.876
and that's what the
hell you've been up to.

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:43.611
- It's not Robbie, it's Barry.

01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:46.647
Barry Cone just
tried to murder me.

01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:49.183
- Barry Cone, Morgan, what
are you talking about?

01:29:49.217 --> 01:29:50.918
- He's in the bathroom,
I can show you.

01:29:50.952 --> 01:29:52.887
- Show me what exactly,
that Barry Cone

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.689
literally just tried
to rape and murder me,

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:57.125
and that this duplicitous
bitch was in on it.

01:29:57.158 --> 01:29:58.893
- Morgan you're
being delusional.

01:29:58.926 --> 01:30:00.895
- Fuck you and everybody
that looks like you Brynn.

01:30:00.928 --> 01:30:02.463
You haven't liked
me from the start.

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:04.165
- That is not true.

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:06.567
- Bull shit you're trying to
get me out of the picture,

01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:08.002
so you can get half
of my dads money.

01:30:08.035 --> 01:30:08.970
I know you.
- Morgan.

01:30:09.003 --> 01:30:10.972
- That is ridiculous.

01:30:12.173 --> 01:30:14.575
- I know what's up you
British piece of shit,

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:15.777
I'm on to you.

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:16.978
- Alright, stop
this now I want you

01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:19.714
to can it with that shit and
apologize to Brynn right now.

01:30:19.747 --> 01:30:21.482
- I'm not apologizing to her.

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:22.884
She's been plotting against me.

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:27.021
- Honestly David, her
behavior is unconscionable.

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:31.592
- Sweetheart, what
are you on right now?

01:30:31.626 --> 01:30:33.528
- I wish the fuck
I was on something,

01:30:34.962 --> 01:30:36.931
just come with me to the
bathroom and I'll show you daddy,

01:30:36.964 --> 01:30:37.932
I'm not crazy.

01:31:08.162 --> 01:31:12.233
- Morgan, Morgan is this
what you wanted to show me.

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:15.903
You've been doing coke
in my house again?

01:31:15.937 --> 01:31:18.773
You haven't learned one God
damn thing yet have you?

01:31:18.806 --> 01:31:19.640
- What?

01:31:22.577 --> 01:31:25.179
- I swear to God, he was
right here on the floor,

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:26.681
so were my clothes.

01:31:26.714 --> 01:31:28.716
- And just what the hell
were your clothes doing

01:31:28.749 --> 01:31:29.917
in the middle of
the bathroom floor

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:31.018
in the first place missy?

01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:32.253
- He made me take them off,

01:31:32.286 --> 01:31:33.821
and he tried to
take his off too,

01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:34.989
and that's when I
cut him and ran.

01:31:35.022 --> 01:31:36.123
- You cut him and ran.

01:31:40.294 --> 01:31:43.664
That's it, that's it,

01:31:43.698 --> 01:31:45.933
you're going back to
rehab and that's final.

01:31:45.967 --> 01:31:48.102
I swear I cannot trust
you to be by yourself

01:31:48.135 --> 01:31:50.037
alone in this house
for five minutes.

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:51.239
- Daddy you're not
listening to me,

01:31:51.272 --> 01:31:52.974
he was here in the
house, he's still here.

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:54.609
- Who's still in
the house, Robbie?

01:31:54.642 --> 01:31:55.843
- No it's not Robbie.

01:31:55.877 --> 01:31:56.777
- Robbie if you can hear me,
God damn it you little asshole

01:31:56.811 --> 01:32:00.047
I want you out of my
house right fucking now.

01:32:00.081 --> 01:32:03.985
- Daddy, it's Barry.

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:05.186
That's what I've been
trying to tell you,

01:32:05.219 --> 01:32:06.621
did he not call you?

01:32:06.654 --> 01:32:09.590
- Sweetheart, nobody
has called me alright.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.028
He probably called her phone,

01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:16.230
seeing as how she and him set
this whole fucking thing up.

01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:18.933
- Okay darling, you're not
making sense of any of this.

01:32:18.966 --> 01:32:20.601
- Don't give me that shit.

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:22.169
You've been fucking Barry
Cone, I know you have.

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:24.906
- I haven't a clue what
you're talking about.

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:28.109
- How much were you
paying him Brynn?

01:32:28.142 --> 01:32:29.176
What was hit cut gonna be?

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:30.378
- His cut?

01:32:30.411 --> 01:32:33.180
- Alright, alright,
quiet, the both of you.

01:32:35.349 --> 01:32:38.152
Cover up for God sake.

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:44.058
- Daddy he's still in
here, I know that he is.

01:32:44.091 --> 01:32:45.026
- That's enough.

01:32:48.296 --> 01:32:51.766
Look I need to have a word
with Brynn in private,

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:54.702
and I want you to
go up to your room

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:57.138
and wait for me, I'll
deal with you in a minute.

01:32:57.171 --> 01:32:58.105
- I'm not going up
there, would you just

01:32:58.139 --> 01:32:59.840
listen to me for once.

01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:02.209
- For once just do what I
told you, go to your room.

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:03.911
- No.

01:33:03.945 --> 01:33:06.247
- Listen girly you're already
in a lot of trouble with me.

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.349
I don't think you want me
to start adding to your list

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:09.350
of problems.

01:33:39.814 --> 01:33:42.416
Alright, what was she
talking about in there?

01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:46.120
- Do you honestly think I
have the slightest clue.

01:33:46.153 --> 01:33:48.122
- Well tell me why
did she just say

01:33:48.155 --> 01:33:49.757
you were fucking Barry Cone.

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:52.293
- Oh come on, surely you
don't believe a word of that.

01:33:52.326 --> 01:33:54.295
- At this point I don't
know what to believe Brynn.

01:33:54.328 --> 01:33:56.864
I don't know what's
real and what isn't.

01:33:58.065 --> 01:34:01.836
- Look David, your daughter
needs serious professional help.

01:34:01.869 --> 01:34:04.271
She's always attempting to
sabotage our relationship.

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:06.073
- We're not talking about
Morgan right now alright.

01:34:06.107 --> 01:34:09.110
We're talking about
you and Barry Cone.

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:11.812
- There's absolutely
nothing to talk about.

01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:14.281
- Is there not, are
you sure about that?

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:16.117
- David I'm positive,
why on Earth

01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:17.985
would I got to bed with Barry?

01:34:18.019 --> 01:34:19.754
- Come on Brynn, I've seen you

01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:21.956
flirt with him plenty of times

01:34:21.989 --> 01:34:23.924
and you have slept
around on me before.

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:27.228
- Yes but not with one of
your colleagues of 15 years,

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:29.730
that's preposterous,
and for your information

01:34:29.764 --> 01:34:32.366
you've slept around on me in
the past just as many times,

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.001
if not more.

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:36.370
- That's not the issue
right now, the issue is you

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:39.040
and Barry Cone and how my
daughter seemed to know

01:34:39.073 --> 01:34:40.775
every nook and cranny about it.

01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:42.076
- I hate to break
it to you David,

01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:43.944
but the only thing
your daughter knows

01:34:43.978 --> 01:34:45.946
is whatever she
believes to be true.

01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:47.782
She's a spoiled little brat,

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:49.784
who lives in her
own feeble mind.

01:34:49.817 --> 01:34:53.054
In her own little
made up fantasy world.

01:34:53.087 --> 01:34:55.456
- Stop changing
the subject Brynn,

01:34:55.489 --> 01:34:58.192
did you or did you
not fuck Barry Cone.

01:34:58.225 --> 01:35:02.363
- Stop grilling me, I do not
want to answer that question.

01:35:02.396 --> 01:35:04.331
- Why, because it's true?

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:06.167
- No because it's absurd

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.936
As many stories as your
daughter's fabricated about me

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:11.338
you actually believe I'm
fooling around on you.

01:35:12.306 --> 01:35:13.974
- I pray to God
you're not Brynn.

01:35:17.311 --> 01:35:19.046
Because if I find out
you've been cheating on me

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:23.317
with him of all people,
you're not gonna like

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:24.251
how I react to it.

01:35:24.285 --> 01:35:26.220
- What is that supposed to mean?

01:35:26.253 --> 01:35:29.190
- Just what I said sweetie,
it better not be true.

01:35:29.223 --> 01:35:30.357
- Or what David?

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:35.129
Suppose you found
out it were true.

01:35:36.497 --> 01:35:37.865
What would you do?

01:35:39.033 --> 01:35:41.802
Would you ground me like
you did your daughter?

01:35:43.337 --> 01:35:46.207
Would you punish me like
a naughty little girl?

01:35:47.341 --> 01:35:50.277
Would you spank me
like you do her David?

01:35:54.281 --> 01:35:55.316
- Is it true?

01:35:58.486 --> 01:36:01.222
- That's it David, do it again

01:36:01.255 --> 01:36:04.125
but much, much harder this time.

01:36:15.336 --> 01:36:18.305
That's what I want,
I love it David.

01:36:18.339 --> 01:36:21.208
- Stop playing games
Brynn, God damn it,

01:36:21.242 --> 01:36:22.943
did you fuck Barry?

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.314
Tell me you didn't.

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:19.526
- God damn it.

01:38:24.465 --> 01:38:27.468
Hit me with a fucking
tennis racket.

01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:48.555
- I'll break your fucking neck.

01:38:54.028 --> 01:38:54.662
Ah fuck!

01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:05.205
You fuck.

01:39:07.474 --> 01:39:08.676
You're gonna keep

01:39:10.511 --> 01:39:11.545
fucking

01:39:12.413 --> 01:39:13.447
quiet.

01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:18.085
How's this for you champ?

01:39:20.054 --> 01:39:22.189
You really fucked
me up you know that?

01:39:22.222 --> 01:39:23.624
Fuck that bitch you quit.

01:39:23.657 --> 01:39:25.392
First I'm gonna
play a little bit.

01:39:25.426 --> 01:39:27.227
How about I get that
same piece of glass

01:39:27.261 --> 01:39:30.397
you stuck in me and fuck
you in the arse with it.

01:39:30.431 --> 01:39:34.101
Maybe a little finger
job to start off with.

01:39:36.236 --> 01:39:40.307
- Get your fingers out of
my you fucking pervert.

01:40:30.557 --> 01:40:31.825
- If any of this
is making you uncomfortable

01:40:31.859 --> 01:40:34.495
in any way just let me know.

01:40:34.528 --> 01:40:36.296
- Right now.

01:40:37.498 --> 01:40:38.665
- Just take it off.

01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:53.347
- Daddy!

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:59.653
- Morgan we
need to get help, fast.

01:41:04.825 --> 01:41:06.794
Well don't just
stand there, help me.

01:41:06.827 --> 01:41:08.429
We need to call the police.

01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:11.765
- Oh God.

01:41:24.711 --> 01:41:26.513
- Why are you
looking at me like that?

01:41:28.715 --> 01:41:29.716
- What did you do?

01:41:32.553 --> 01:41:36.256
- What you
don't think I did this?

01:41:44.331 --> 01:41:46.834
Morgan, you must listen to me.

01:41:48.435 --> 01:41:49.403
Morgan wait!

01:43:10.017 --> 01:43:10.851
Fuck!

01:43:26.466 --> 01:43:28.702
Morgan, Morgan where are you.

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:33.740
Morgan darling tell
me where you are.

01:43:33.774 --> 01:43:38.745
Morgan I can't help you unless
you tell me where you are.

01:43:40.847 --> 01:43:41.682
Morgan!

01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:47.054
Morgan?

01:43:48.689 --> 01:43:50.958
Morgan darling, are you in here?

01:43:56.863 --> 01:43:58.799
Where are you Morgan?

01:44:00.834 --> 01:44:03.770
Morgan, tell me where you are!

01:44:22.823 --> 01:44:23.857
Morgan!

01:45:24.084 --> 01:45:27.688
Make it easy on your
poor old stepmother.

01:45:38.665 --> 01:45:39.499
Bitch!

01:46:00.887 --> 01:46:03.056
- You aint my stepmother bitch.

01:47:23.970 --> 01:47:25.005
Shit.

01:47:43.089 --> 01:47:44.057
- Morgan baby.

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:49.796
I think you hurt my head
real bad, I'm dizzy.

01:47:53.867 --> 01:47:54.701
I need a doctor.

01:48:01.241 --> 01:48:05.712
You little sow, I can
smell you down here.

01:48:13.787 --> 01:48:15.922
You naughty little bitch.

01:48:15.956 --> 01:48:17.991
Open the fucking
door, I'll murder you

01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:19.559
like I did you mother.

01:48:25.298 --> 01:48:26.933
- What are you talking about?

01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:32.606
- I guess the cats
out of the bag now isn't it.

01:48:34.741 --> 01:48:36.076
- What did you do to my mother?

01:48:37.744 --> 01:48:40.580
- Let's just say I managed
to slip a little something

01:48:40.614 --> 01:48:42.115
in her wine glass.

01:48:42.148 --> 01:48:44.184
Your mother was always
so drunk and pathetic,

01:48:44.217 --> 01:48:46.119
making it look like she drowned,

01:48:46.152 --> 01:48:47.287
that was the easy part.

01:48:53.994 --> 01:48:55.896
- You fucking bitch.

01:48:55.929 --> 01:48:59.966
- You're quite right sweetie,
I am a fucking bitch.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.770
When someone stands in my
way I get rid of them fast.

01:49:03.803 --> 01:49:07.874
- Please, why are
you doing this?

01:49:07.908 --> 01:49:11.011
- It's about money
honey, pure and simple.

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:13.213
The kind of money that's kept
you in diamond nipple rings

01:49:13.246 --> 01:49:15.181
and silk panties
your whole life.

01:49:17.117 --> 01:49:20.687
- Fuck you, I fucking hate you.

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:24.057
- Of course you do, you
have from the very start.

01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:25.992
You remind me of my
own rotten daughter,

01:49:26.026 --> 01:49:29.596
she's a spoilt ungrateful
little shit just like you.

01:49:30.697 --> 01:49:32.966
Now open this fucking door.

01:50:18.211 --> 01:50:19.045
Bitch!

01:50:28.822 --> 01:50:30.223
Bloody little brat.

01:50:59.886 --> 01:51:02.055
Morgan, you can't get away,

01:51:06.026 --> 01:51:07.794
I'm right behind you.

01:51:18.038 --> 01:51:18.872
Fuck.

01:51:21.541 --> 01:51:23.910
Oh Morgie, Morgie darling.

01:51:37.057 --> 01:51:40.060
You wouldn't happen to be going
to your grandma's would you?

01:51:46.866 --> 01:51:50.236
You're making this
too easy on me Morgan.

01:51:52.105 --> 01:51:53.339
Fucking foot.

01:52:04.317 --> 01:52:09.255
Morgan, you can't
hide from me forever.

01:52:09.289 --> 01:52:12.192
I know everything
about this house.

01:52:12.225 --> 01:52:14.027
Inside and out.

01:52:15.895 --> 01:52:18.231
You might as well
just come on out.

01:52:32.312 --> 01:52:36.015
What the fuck are you
looking at you cunt.

01:52:48.361 --> 01:52:49.395
- Hey.

01:53:10.049 --> 01:53:15.054
- You're finished whore,
say hello to your mother.

01:53:25.965 --> 01:53:28.268
- Say hello to my grandmother.

01:53:30.170 --> 01:53:32.305
- Get her off me, she's mad.

01:53:37.944 --> 01:53:40.580
Get the hell of
me, I'll kill you.

01:55:06.766 --> 01:55:09.535
- The harlot, the
harlot is gone.

01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:20.413
- Grandma.

01:55:23.716 --> 01:55:25.618
Something's wrong.

01:55:31.324 --> 01:55:32.592
I don't feel right.

01:55:38.498 --> 01:55:39.966
I can't breath.

01:58:53.259 --> 01:58:54.794
- My body feels
like an impostor,

01:58:57.563 --> 01:58:58.631
my head is a void.

01:59:01.634 --> 01:59:03.870
Mother, love me.

02:00:03.796 --> 02:00:04.764
What the fuck is this?

02:00:24.817 --> 02:00:25.851
Grandma?

02:00:29.555 --> 02:00:30.556
You in here?

02:01:03.723 --> 02:01:04.557
Shit.

02:01:53.839 --> 02:01:55.808
- What is going on here?

02:02:19.031 --> 02:02:22.101
Oh my God, what the fuck!

02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:30.643
You can't leave
me stuck in here.

02:02:33.045 --> 02:02:34.880
Please, open the door.

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:56.602
God damn it, let me
the fuck out of here.

02:02:59.805 --> 02:03:01.607
Open the fucking door.

02:04:11.677 --> 02:04:12.511
Please.

02:04:20.986 --> 02:04:23.155
Please, please be forever.
