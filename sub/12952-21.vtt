TO SAVE YOU
FROM CERTAIN EXECUTION.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.316
MY FATHER TOLD ME YOU WERE
WORKING WITH MY MOTHER.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.017
I AM.

15:53.019 --> 15:54.719
WHEN YOUR MOTHER
RETURNED TO RUSSIA,

15:54.721 --> 15:57.021
SHE WAS IMMEDIATELY
APPREHENDED.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.623
HER LOYALTIES
WERE QUESTIONABLE.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.659
AFTER A FEW MONTHS IN JAIL,

16:01.661 --> 16:05.196
SHE GAVE BIRTH
TO A LITTLE GIRL.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.198
THAT GIRL WAS ONE DAY OLD

16:07.200 --> 16:10.468
WHEN SHE WAS TAKEN AWAY
FROM YOUR MOTHER.

16:10.470 --> 16:14.339
THE ONLY REASON I JOINED
THE RUSSIAN SECRET SERVICE

16:14.341 --> 16:17.375
WAS TO HELP IRINA
FIND HER YOUNGER DAUGHTER.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.644
FOR YEARS WE HEARD
NOTHING ABOUT HER.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.679
EVERY LEAD WENT COLD.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.115
BUT THEN RECENTLY
WE FOUND OUT

16:24.117 --> 16:27.151
THAT HER FATHER ARVIN SLOANE
WAS ALSO LOOKING FOR HER.

16:29.355 --> 16:30.722
WHAT IS IT, SYDNEY?

16:32.524 --> 16:34.125
SLOANE HAS HER.

17:00.486 --> 17:03.588
THIS IS UNEXPECTED --

17:03.590 --> 17:05.356
AND UNACCEPTABLE.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.724
NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO,
ARVIN.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.594
WE'VE RECOVERED
THREE CANISTERS

17:09.596 --> 17:11.128
OF RAMBALDI'S FLUID.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.731
THEY'RE YOURS...

17:13.733 --> 17:15.500
IN EXCHANGE
FOR A PARTNERSHIP.

17:17.102 --> 17:20.038

MADE THAT MISTAKE.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.740

17:22.742 --> 17:25.609

FOR ALL OF US TO SHARE.

INDEED HAVE THE GIRL,

17:41.127 --> 17:43.394
THE REST OF THE CANISTERS
WILL BE DELIVERED.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.164
AND OF COURSE WE WILL NEED
TO SEE A DEMONSTRATION FIRST.

17:46.166 --> 17:49.400

THE FLUID ACTUALLY WORKS.

17:50.602 --> 17:52.303

THE FLUID CONTAINS

17:55.508 --> 17:56.808

17:56.810 --> 18:00.211

AND WHEN INJECTED,

18:00.213 --> 18:02.280
THE PROTEIN MOVES INTO
THE CEREBRAL CORTEX.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.482
THEORETICALLY, IT COULD
TRIGGER AN INDIVIDUAL
