00:05.200 --> 00:06.280

00:17.380 --> 00:18.510
It's the perfect holiday.

00:18.560 --> 00:22.210
You get to cook outside,
blow stuff up, wear shorts.

00:22.260 --> 00:24.130
Easter should be
taking notes.

00:24.170 --> 00:28.090
Both: ♪ Keep your eyes

00:28.130 --> 00:29.700
That was longer
than I remember.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.659
Hello?

00:32.700 --> 00:36.180
Joe, you should be thankful
that you live in this country.

00:36.230 --> 00:39.530
I spent half of my childhood
in a Banana Republic.

00:39.580 --> 00:42.190
It was the only store in my village
that had air-conditioner.

00:42.230 --> 00:44.020
Yes, Mr. President.

00:44.060 --> 00:46.190
Yes, sir, I'd be honored to,
sir. Thank you.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.190
Amazing news.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.500
The grand marshal for today's
parade just got #MeToo'd,

00:50.540 --> 00:52.160
and they need me
to fill in.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.900
Oh, Jay,
I'm so happy for you!

00:54.940 --> 00:57.030
So, now the only thing left
on your bucket list

00:57.070 --> 00:59.380
is to bare-knuckle fight
a Russian!

00:59.420 --> 01:00.380
Ay!

01:00.420 --> 01:02.820
Oh, and Manny's
gonna be back home

01:02.860 --> 01:06.130
from his big road trip
just in time for the parade.

01:06.170 --> 01:08.520
He's been gone for so long.
I can't wait to see him.

01:08.560 --> 01:09.780
That's great!

01:09.820 --> 01:11.390
We'll have the whole family
back together with me

01:11.440 --> 01:13.570
to ride
in the convertible LeBaron.

01:13.610 --> 01:14.610
Joe, how's
your parade wave?

01:15.570 --> 01:17.220
We'll work on it.

01:38.460 --> 01:41.420
Yeah. I've got time
to help you.

01:41.470 --> 01:42.940
Oh, look at your cousin
being so sweet

01:42.990 --> 01:44.380
and helping out
a friend.

01:44.420 --> 01:47.990
Ugh! Such a weak little coward.
Are we done yet?

01:48.040 --> 01:50.300
No.
It's a really big bridge.

01:50.340 --> 01:52.430
Or maybe you're just
a really tiny man.

01:53.870 --> 01:55.780
Things were going great
on my cross-country drive

01:55.830 --> 01:57.660
until I fell behind schedule

01:57.700 --> 02:00.010
after I developed a perfectly
rational, fact-based fear

02:00.050 --> 02:02.270
of driving over bridges.

02:02.310 --> 02:04.750
I called Cam for support
since he taught driver's ed,

02:04.790 --> 02:07.100
- but he wasn't around.
- what?

02:07.140 --> 02:08.750
Turns out
a strong verbal lashing

02:08.800 --> 02:11.360
was exactly what I needed
to get me across that bridge

02:11.410 --> 02:14.110
and the many others that cover
this country like a cancer.

02:14.150 --> 02:17.330
Okay, Cal.
Let's say hi to Mommy.

02:17.370 --> 02:18.590
Say, "Hi, Mommy!"Whoa, whoa.

02:18.630 --> 02:20.850
if I'm in that shot, back up
a-and turn the lights down.

02:20.900 --> 02:23.420
We had Chinese food last night.
I look like a blowfish.

02:23.460 --> 02:25.070
Okay, you know what, Mitchell?
It's not about you.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.600
I promised we would send
a video of Cal

02:27.640 --> 02:30.040
to my sister
for her birthday,

02:30.080 --> 02:32.990
and that was a week ago,
so we got to get it done.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.350
We have been watching
my big-for-his-age nephew Cal

02:36.390 --> 02:38.130
while my sister Pameron
is --

02:38.170 --> 02:40.090
is back in Missouri
paying off a little debt.

02:40.130 --> 02:41.440
To society.
She's in prison.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.830
For a tiny
parole violation.

02:42.870 --> 02:44.310
She tried something on
in a store

02:44.350 --> 02:45.220
and accidentally
walked out.

02:45.270 --> 02:46.880
It was
another woman's purse.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.490
The silver lining is,

02:48.530 --> 02:51.620
Cal is benefiting from
our parenting experience.

02:51.670 --> 02:54.230
Mitchell is
molding young Cal's brain

02:54.280 --> 02:56.670
while I handle
the young boy's body.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.150
It's a miracle
we're not in prison.

02:58.190 --> 02:59.410
Yeah.

02:59.460 --> 03:02.290
Okay, let's sing the alphabet
for Mommy.

03:02.330 --> 03:03.500
Come on, you and I
worked on this.

03:05.290 --> 03:06.850
6!

03:06.900 --> 03:08.470
You know, I think I put
so much information in there,

03:08.510 --> 03:10.340
it's getting jumbled up
on the way out.

03:10.380 --> 03:11.600
Well, let's -- let's do
some of your stuff.

03:11.640 --> 03:12.690
Throw him a ball
or something.

03:12.730 --> 03:14.650
Oh, okay, yeah.
That's a great idea.

03:14.690 --> 03:16.650
Okay, on the count
of 3, Cal.

03:16.690 --> 03:18.870
Are you ready?
1, 2, 3!

03:18.910 --> 03:20.390
Oh. Okay.

03:20.430 --> 03:22.090
All right, um...
well, hugs!

03:22.130 --> 03:23.960
Hey,
how about a hug?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.830
Aww.
He is such a good hugger.

03:26.870 --> 03:27.920
Okay,
here's the thing --

03:27.960 --> 03:29.400
football camp started
when Cal came.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.660
Then I was laid up

03:30.700 --> 03:32.490
because of that dinner
at Absolutely Crabulous.

03:32.530 --> 03:35.410
Well, don't worry. I've been
slacking on my end, too.

03:35.450 --> 03:38.060
Yeah, but I've been telling Pam
that Cal is thriving here.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.800
We can't send her a video
of him reciting his AB6s!

03:41.980 --> 03:44.500
- I wonder...
- Go on. I'm in.

03:44.540 --> 03:46.550
Is it possible
to shoot him in a way

03:46.590 --> 03:48.370
that makes him look better
than he is?

03:48.420 --> 03:50.290
Oh, honey, are you kidding?
Vin Diesel's a movie star.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.420
Anything's possible
with editing.

03:54.820 --> 03:56.080
What do you got there?

03:56.120 --> 03:58.300
Oh, just choosing some classes
for college.

03:58.340 --> 04:00.170
This one looks interesting.

04:00.210 --> 04:03.350
"In this intensive" Nope.

04:03.390 --> 04:05.960
Drop that!

04:06.000 --> 04:07.740
Game day, buddy.

04:07.790 --> 04:10.090
For the first time ever,
Luke and I are taking part

04:10.140 --> 04:12.920
in the sport of kings,
the savory science.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.450
We're teamed in a parent/child
hot-dog-eating contest.

04:15.490 --> 04:17.579
We've been training for weeks,
and I'm proud to say that Luke,

04:17.620 --> 04:20.890
like his old man, is blessed
with a dogger's mouth.

04:20.930 --> 04:22.580
I felt
something tear inside.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.240
Push through it.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.370
You'll thank me when you start
to feel the gorger's high.

04:31.420 --> 04:32.940
Aah!
What the hell?!

04:32.980 --> 04:34.590
Oh, is the hot dog
making you angry?

04:34.640 --> 04:37.550
An angry stomach is 12% larger.
Boo!

04:37.600 --> 04:39.250
I think
we've got a real shot

04:39.300 --> 04:41.120
to take down
Rhonda and Thandie Hodak.

04:41.170 --> 04:42.470
But they're undefeated.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.560
I guess that makes us
"under-dogs."

04:44.600 --> 04:46.910
Mm. How long
you been sitting on that one?

04:46.950 --> 04:49.220
Not as long as you've been
sitting on that couch.

04:49.260 --> 04:50.480
-Hm.
-Hey, hey.

04:50.520 --> 04:51.790
Can I get in
on that floor bagel?

04:51.830 --> 04:54.790
Alex decided to take off
some time earlier this summer,

04:54.830 --> 04:56.920
and, like everything else
she does,

04:56.960 --> 04:58.620
she did it a little too well.

04:59.790 --> 05:02.410
Who's there?
Did you bring food?

05:02.450 --> 05:04.410
Uh...tomatoes.

05:04.450 --> 05:06.410
But they won't be ready
for six weeks.

05:06.450 --> 05:07.710
You have a backup?

05:07.760 --> 05:09.460
Well, I fell asleep
on my phone,

05:09.500 --> 05:11.500
and I think my face
ordered another one.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.550
You know,
do you want to join me?

05:14.590 --> 05:16.030
You go back to work
in a few weeks.

05:16.070 --> 05:17.720
You'll regret it
if you don't relax a little.

05:17.770 --> 05:19.600
Uh, okay. Sure.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.080
The-- This can wait
10 minutes

05:22.120 --> 05:25.520
until I get him
into the ground, right?

05:26.990 --> 05:28.870
Can you scratch my nose?
I feel like you're closer.

05:28.910 --> 05:30.650
Okay, up on the table

05:30.690 --> 05:33.520
for a little stomach massage
and heckler prep.

05:33.570 --> 05:35.610
Hey, gals, things haven't
been going that great

05:35.660 --> 05:37.440
between me and Arvin,
and he's stopping by

05:37.480 --> 05:39.490
to say goodbye
before leaving for Switzerland.

05:39.530 --> 05:41.180
Could you
take off the onesies

05:41.230 --> 05:43.270
and make it look like we don't
live in an insane asylum?

05:43.320 --> 05:46.100
- You suck!
- You eat like a moron!

05:46.140 --> 05:48.410
Oh, my God!
It's like you want Arvin

05:48.450 --> 05:50.840
to throw his return ticket
off an Alp!

05:50.890 --> 05:53.060
Mm. No wonder
she's so stressed.

05:53.110 --> 05:54.850
She's wearing, like,
a seven-sie.

05:58.590 --> 06:00.990
Haley.
Fancy meeting you here.

06:01.030 --> 06:03.470
- Wait, why? I-I live here.

06:03.510 --> 06:05.860
No, I-I know. I was --
I was making a joke.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.210
It was stupid.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.300
Oh, no, it -- it wasn't stupid.
It was funny.

06:09.340 --> 06:10.650
Well, you didn't laugh.

06:10.690 --> 06:12.560
Well, do it again.
I'll laugh this time.

06:12.610 --> 06:14.260
I'd rather not.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.440
Sorry. I'm just,
um, a little --

06:16.480 --> 06:19.310
I'm really nervous,
and I feel like this goodbye

06:19.350 --> 06:20.660
has so much pressure
on it.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.920
So let's just relax
and be with each other.

06:24.620 --> 06:25.620
I actually have to go.

06:26.660 --> 06:28.360
No, seriously.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.100
I misread my itinerary,

06:30.140 --> 06:32.020
and I have to
get to the airport.

06:32.060 --> 06:33.930
No! So, uh,
this is it?

06:33.970 --> 06:35.720
This is goodbye?

06:35.760 --> 06:37.540
I'm afraid so.

06:37.590 --> 06:38.370
I'm gonna miss you.

06:38.410 --> 06:39.680
I'll miss you, too.

06:39.720 --> 06:41.460
Aww.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.510
That's my car.
I should probably --

06:43.550 --> 06:45.250
Okay.

06:45.290 --> 06:47.600
Uh, well...
goodbye, Haley.

06:52.730 --> 06:54.340
Love you.

06:55.210 --> 06:56.300
Love you, too.

07:00.130 --> 07:01.180
Is he gone?

07:02.610 --> 07:03.870
-Yeah?
-Oh, good.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.620
No one wants
old fuddy-duddy dad

07:05.660 --> 07:07.140
ruining
the big romantic moment.

07:07.180 --> 07:09.010
I'll be upstairs
hiding in Luke's closet.

07:14.450 --> 07:15.760
All right. There we go, Cal.
Chew the peanut butter.

07:15.800 --> 07:16.840
See? Now, with editing,
we can make it look like

07:16.890 --> 07:18.320
he's saying
anything we want --

07:18.370 --> 07:20.330
numbers, the alphabet,
a joke about Jewish people.

07:20.370 --> 07:21.630
Pam loves those.

07:21.670 --> 07:23.110
Movie tricks
come easy to me --

07:23.150 --> 07:25.720
you know, clowns
being naturals at deception.

07:25.770 --> 07:27.720
It's true --
a couple months into dating,

07:27.770 --> 07:29.550
Cam told me
he was a clown,

07:29.600 --> 07:31.160
did a little performance
for me,

07:31.210 --> 07:32.560
and I --
I did feel deceived.

07:33.990 --> 07:36.340
Okay, now,
when I say "action,"

07:36.380 --> 07:37.690
Cal's gonna
throw me the ball.

07:37.730 --> 07:39.080
You're gonna
walk backwards,

07:39.130 --> 07:40.650
and then in editing,
I'll reverse it

07:40.690 --> 07:42.350
to make it look like
Cal's catching the ball

07:42.390 --> 07:43.520
and you're
walking normally.

07:43.570 --> 07:45.180
Why am I
even in it at all?

07:45.220 --> 07:47.530
Remind me of something,
Mitchell -- is the best art made

07:47.570 --> 07:50.490
by a million voices chiming in
or one man with a single vision?

07:51.790 --> 07:54.930
Okay, and we'll lay in
the piano later.

07:54.970 --> 07:59.230
♪ Twinkle, twinkle,
little star ♪

07:59.280 --> 08:03.370

08:03.410 --> 08:04.590

-He has to pee.

08:04.630 --> 08:06.330
Okay, he has to pee.
Yep.

08:06.370 --> 08:07.590
All right.
Take five!

08:08.770 --> 08:10.160
Lily,
this is our first cut,

08:10.200 --> 08:13.200
so if you see anything wonky,
let us know.

08:16.690 --> 08:17.770
Oh. Hello, Mommy.

08:17.820 --> 08:19.600
Happy birthday.

08:19.650 --> 08:22.690
1 plus 1 is 2.

08:22.740 --> 08:24.430
Simple math.

08:24.480 --> 08:25.830
I can catch a ball.

08:29.830 --> 08:30.610
How'd you miss the cat?

08:30.660 --> 08:32.960
I didn't.
That take was your best walk.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.840
That is gold.

08:47.540 --> 08:48.810
Why the giant bottle
of wine?

08:48.850 --> 08:51.630
It's for perspective,
and nobody's asking that question.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.250
- Didn't I just ask it?
- Cam.

08:54.290 --> 08:56.420
Yeah, I know.
It's certified rotten.

09:02.430 --> 09:04.260
Luke.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.390
He's only getting 1/3 of the dog
on his first bite.

09:06.430 --> 09:08.170
Anything less than half,
and you're playing for second.

09:08.220 --> 09:11.870
Well, the good news is,
the Fourth is weeks away.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.260
Um...

09:13.310 --> 09:15.610
it's -- it's today.

09:15.660 --> 09:18.050
Toda-- June...?

09:18.100 --> 09:19.880
Yeah -- gone.
Oh.

09:21.140 --> 09:23.970
There you are!
It's almost time for our show.

09:24.010 --> 09:26.100
- Wait -- what are you wearing?
- Clothes?

09:26.150 --> 09:27.410
I got to get back
into school mode

09:27.450 --> 09:29.240
before I lose
my edge.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.800
Mom, you might want to think
about rejoining life

09:30.850 --> 09:32.630
before yourbrain
freezes, too.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.630
Yeah,
don't you worry about...

09:34.680 --> 09:35.630
me.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.550
What's that?

09:39.600 --> 09:41.420
Oh. Um...

09:41.470 --> 09:42.340
Listen.

09:43.950 --> 09:46.690
No dad wants to have this talk
with his son, but...

09:46.730 --> 09:48.690
you're just not
eating enough hot dogs.

09:48.730 --> 09:50.430
I'm sorry.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.650
For some reason,
I just -- I can't focus.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.700
I think what Luke
is trying to say is,

09:55.740 --> 09:56.830
he's too old
for this contest

09:56.870 --> 09:58.830
and he doesn't have the heart
to tell you.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.570
That's impossible. I'm an adult.
I'm still super into it.

10:01.620 --> 10:05.140
Yeah. My 20s should be
my prime hot-dog-eating years.

10:05.190 --> 10:06.880
That was just
my first attempt.

10:06.930 --> 10:08.710
I'm gonna figure this out.
Hang on.

10:08.750 --> 10:12.450
Despite what Alex says,
I have not lost my edge.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.590
Something just clicked.

10:14.630 --> 10:16.720
Fine. You're right --
it's college.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.460
It is?
Yeah.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.900
I'm distracted because
I'm feeling some pressure

10:19.940 --> 10:21.850
on which classes to take.

10:21.900 --> 10:23.380
But don't worry.
I'm gonna figure it out.

10:25.860 --> 10:27.600
Wow.
How could you tell?

10:28.910 --> 10:31.780
I'm just a...
perceptive guy.

10:31.820 --> 10:33.820
I wasn't talking about Luke.
The clicking was in my jaw.

10:33.870 --> 10:36.740
My old TMJ injury was back,
thanks to all the training.

10:36.780 --> 10:38.960
I got it in college
when I bet my roommate

10:39.000 --> 10:41.830
I could out-Frisbee-catch
his golden retriever.

10:41.870 --> 10:43.440
And guess who wo-- Aah!

10:45.790 --> 10:46.920
-Ugh.
-Aw.

10:46.970 --> 10:48.970
Arvin and I
had the worst goodbye.

10:49.010 --> 10:50.880
Aww.It's been such a weird
past couple months.

10:50.930 --> 10:52.490
That long?

10:52.540 --> 10:54.150
It feels like it all started
in the hospital,

10:54.190 --> 10:55.540
after I told him
I loved him.

10:55.580 --> 10:56.980
There you go.

10:57.020 --> 10:58.500
That's it.
You pressured him.

10:58.540 --> 11:00.550
Too much, too soon.Maybe.

11:00.590 --> 11:02.550
Something's
not lining up.

11:02.590 --> 11:03.940
Okay, you're right.

11:03.980 --> 11:05.290
Seriously?!

11:05.330 --> 11:07.940
Something happened in the hospital
while Arvin was gone.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.430
Lost again?

11:11.470 --> 11:13.780
No. This time,
I meantto come back.

11:13.820 --> 11:15.870
I have
some pretty big news.

11:15.910 --> 11:17.950
You should probably
be sitting for this.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.300
O...kay.

11:26.050 --> 11:26.880
I lied.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.010
I'm not married anymore.

11:29.050 --> 11:31.010
My wife left me
for her ex-husband.

11:31.050 --> 11:32.270
I'm a divorcé.

11:33.230 --> 11:34.750
Why are you
telling me this?

11:34.800 --> 11:37.320
Because I'm back in town,
I'm going to nursing school,

11:37.360 --> 11:39.540
and we might
run into each other.

11:39.580 --> 11:40.980
I don't want to
spend the rest of my life

11:41.020 --> 11:42.980
pretending my wife
is in the bathroom.

11:43.020 --> 11:46.370
Yeah, I wouldstart to
worry about her after a while.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.420
Well, I'm sorry
it didn't work out.

11:48.460 --> 11:51.160
It's okay. I don't think
we ever really got each other.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.900
Like, you know how when you and I
used to go to concerts,

11:53.950 --> 11:56.210
we used to just look
at each other and know...

11:56.250 --> 11:57.990
It was time for me
to get on your shoulders

11:58.040 --> 11:59.040
and throw my bra
at the drummer.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.210
Yeah.

12:00.260 --> 12:02.260
Like, you probably
have that with Arvin, right?

12:02.300 --> 12:03.700
Definitely.That's awesome.

12:03.740 --> 12:04.910
With my wife,

12:04.960 --> 12:08.660
she's pretty and smart
and a doctor.

12:08.700 --> 12:10.400
But if you're always
telling yourself

12:10.440 --> 12:11.700
how lucky you are,

12:11.750 --> 12:14.010
it's probably because
you're afraid to ask yourself

12:14.050 --> 12:14.840
how happy you are.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.840
Right?

12:16.880 --> 12:19.060
I brought ice chips.

12:19.100 --> 12:22.060
Or are they
ice frieshere?

12:22.980 --> 12:24.720
Ha.

12:26.020 --> 12:28.500
I can't believe
Dylan got into my head.

12:28.550 --> 12:30.290
I can't believe
he got into nursing school.

12:33.730 --> 12:34.810
That's the biggest one
they got?

12:34.860 --> 12:37.420
Yes, and I'm not
going back again.

12:37.470 --> 12:39.300
Have you seen Manny? I've been
looking all over for him.

12:39.340 --> 12:40.650
I don't see him.

12:40.690 --> 12:43.080
I've been here,
busy inspecting the troops.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.300
Young lady, could you
straighten that hat?

12:45.350 --> 12:47.430
Sir, that -- that horn
could use a shine.

12:47.480 --> 12:48.870
Haircut.

12:48.910 --> 12:50.740
Gloria, if this goes well,
in a couple of months,

12:50.790 --> 12:52.400
I'll be lighting
the town Christmas tree.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.750
- Take that, Dad!
- You know what is weird?

12:54.790 --> 12:57.440
After so many years
at CarnivÃ le,

12:57.490 --> 13:00.100
to be at a parade
with people fully dressed.

13:00.140 --> 13:01.320
Gloria, focus.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.970
You've got
a big role in this.

13:03.020 --> 13:05.890
After I cut the ribbon,
it's your job to fire off the cannon.

13:05.930 --> 13:08.280
That's the signal for everybody
to start marching.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.420
But isn't the grand marshal's job
to fire the cannon?

13:11.460 --> 13:12.980
So the ribbon
cuts itself?

13:13.030 --> 13:14.550
Gloria, what you don't know
about parades...

13:14.590 --> 13:15.720
Wait, wait.

13:15.770 --> 13:18.470
Papi! Hello.

13:18.510 --> 13:20.640
Are you coming?
The parade is about to start.

13:20.690 --> 13:22.730
Hey! Jay!

13:22.770 --> 13:24.080
Hey, Tom!
How's it going?

13:24.120 --> 13:27.080
Great, actually.
My wife and I, we're back together.

13:27.130 --> 13:30.130
I-- Well, not exactly.
I mean, we're going on dates.

13:30.170 --> 13:31.260
We're hoping
to recapture --Yeah, yeah.

13:31.300 --> 13:32.570
I want to hear
all about it,

13:32.610 --> 13:34.260
but I think the local paper
needs a photo.

13:34.310 --> 13:36.010
Oh.
O-Of course. Yeah.

13:36.050 --> 13:37.050
Gloria,
get in the shot.

13:38.140 --> 13:39.790
Gloria.

13:39.840 --> 13:42.580
But you promised
that you were going to come.

13:42.620 --> 13:44.140
Just shoot.
No, go ahead -- shoot it.

13:44.190 --> 13:45.930
What? Okay.

13:45.970 --> 13:47.150
No, no, not yet!

13:51.190 --> 13:52.940
Damn it, Gloria!
It's not cutting!

13:52.980 --> 13:53.940
These aren't lefties!

13:56.940 --> 13:59.030
Grand Marshal.
Take that, Grandpa!

13:59.070 --> 14:00.290
You must be
on top of the world.

14:00.330 --> 14:01.900
Well, I'm putting on
a brave face

14:01.940 --> 14:03.340
for the good of the country,
but the truth is,

14:03.380 --> 14:05.120
we did not
get off to a great start.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.170
Gloria is not
on her game today,

14:07.210 --> 14:08.080
and I'm afraid
she's gonna forget

14:08.120 --> 14:10.740
to lead the standing ovation
after my speech.

14:10.780 --> 14:12.740
Hm.
In fact,
I'm tagging you in.

14:12.780 --> 14:14.910
Your cue is
"pursuit of happiness."

14:14.960 --> 14:16.780
And if you could sell it,
a "bravo" would be nice.

14:16.830 --> 14:19.000
Okay. I-I know
what's wrong with Gloria.

14:19.050 --> 14:20.920
This is a big day for you,
and she's feeling left out.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.050
No, that's not it.

14:22.090 --> 14:23.270
Damn it.

14:23.310 --> 14:24.920
You're not getting here
till tomorrow?

14:24.970 --> 14:27.750
How does your name
even have the word "man" in it?

14:27.800 --> 14:28.970
Something just clicked.

14:29.010 --> 14:30.360
Jaw trouble?
No!

14:30.410 --> 14:33.630
She was just on with Manny,
who's not coming.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.930
Don't Gloria and Manny have
some Fourth of July tradition?

14:35.980 --> 14:37.810
Come to think of it,

14:37.850 --> 14:40.030
they share a slice of apple pie
and watch the fireworks.

14:40.070 --> 14:41.940
They've been doing that
every year since he was born!

14:41.980 --> 14:45.810
Until thisyear,
which is why Gloria is upset.

14:45.860 --> 14:47.160
Yes!
You're right!

14:47.210 --> 14:48.730
Mm-hmm.
I let the sash
go to my head.

14:48.770 --> 14:49.950
I never
should have brought it!

14:49.990 --> 14:51.430
Oh, I can help you out,

14:51.470 --> 14:53.340
but you're gonna have to give up
on your little speech thing.

14:53.390 --> 14:55.080
Hey, kid. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where'd you get the fireworks?

14:55.130 --> 14:57.830
- You a cop?
- Oh, co--

14:57.870 --> 14:59.440
There's a stand in
the grocery store parking lot.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.000
But he's closing up.

15:01.050 --> 15:02.870
You get the fireworks
and the apple pie.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.310
I will take care
of Manny.

15:04.350 --> 15:06.230
I am back.
I am really back!

15:06.270 --> 15:07.530
My car's blocked in.

15:07.570 --> 15:08.790
All this traffic,
I'll never make it.

15:08.840 --> 15:09.970
Look at that --
right there.

15:11.060 --> 15:13.190
Check out! I'm a Shriner.

15:13.230 --> 15:15.230
Cool! Listen,
I need to borrow your car.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.410
It's kind of
an emergency.

15:16.450 --> 15:18.460
But my dad's excited
to see me in the parade.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.800
He was
a Tuskegee Airman.

15:19.850 --> 15:21.890
Maybe the minute
you stop trying so hard

15:21.940 --> 15:23.760
is the minute
he'll start loving you.

15:23.810 --> 15:25.330
Now hop out of there
and go clear a path for me

15:25.380 --> 15:26.810
through those lawn chairs.

15:26.850 --> 15:28.290
Come on.
I'll help you out.But...I don't --

15:29.900 --> 15:32.210
Oh, how about
this one, okay?

15:32.250 --> 15:33.990
Maybe we'll get lucky
and he'll be good at this.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.990
Okay, don't you think
this is a little hateful --

15:36.040 --> 15:38.130
waterboarding a clown
for a prize?Oh, come on.

15:38.170 --> 15:39.870
You guys spray each other
with seltzer all the time.

15:39.910 --> 15:41.260
That's between
two consenting clowns.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.610
All right, one second.
Let's get this.

15:43.650 --> 15:46.050
Okay, go ahead.
Okay.

15:46.090 --> 15:48.180
No. No.
Wrong way, wrong way.Oh, okay, all right, all right,
You got to --

15:48.220 --> 15:49.620
-Okay, it's fine.
-You know what?

15:49.660 --> 15:53.840
Maybe it's just time we admit to Pam
we haven't taught him a thing.

15:53.880 --> 15:56.230
You know, I just --
I don't want to let him down.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.670
I-I've come to really enjoy
having him around.

15:58.710 --> 16:00.150
I know, I know.
Me too.

16:00.190 --> 16:02.150
But it's not like
we're bad at parenting.

16:02.190 --> 16:04.850
I mean, Lily turned out to be
a smart, sensitive little girl.

16:04.890 --> 16:07.680
Ugh! You're a disgrace
to this family!

16:07.720 --> 16:10.160
Manny:
I don't think you heard me.
I'm over the bridge.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.030
I know.
Now we're just catching up.

16:12.070 --> 16:14.290
Sorry I didn't win.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.690
Oh, no, no, no. You don't
have to apologize, okay?

16:16.730 --> 16:18.040
No, no,
you did just great.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.040
Oh! We'rethe ones
who need to do better.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.910
And you know what?
You give great hugs.

16:21.950 --> 16:23.870
Hey.
We taught him that.

16:23.910 --> 16:25.960
Well, too bad
it isn't exactly a skill.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.050
Yeah.
Or is it?

16:29.270 --> 16:30.960
Mutton busting?!

16:31.010 --> 16:32.180
Why? What is that?

16:32.220 --> 16:35.100
It's a sheep rodeo
for kids.

16:35.140 --> 16:36.750
It's like you didn't even
have a childhood.

16:36.790 --> 16:38.320
Come on!

16:38.360 --> 16:41.280
Announcer: The hot dog contest
is about to begin.

16:41.320 --> 16:42.930
Sorry I'm not
in worse shape for this.

16:42.970 --> 16:45.280
Don't worry about it, buddy.
You've had a lot on your mind.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.280
Any luck
choosing your courses?

16:47.330 --> 16:48.330
Not yet.

16:48.370 --> 16:50.550
I don't really want
to talk about that right now.

16:50.590 --> 16:52.070
Maybe you're putting
too much pressure on --

16:52.110 --> 16:54.070
It's more than just
picking classes, okay?

16:54.120 --> 16:56.470
Can we just drop it and focus
on what we're doing here?

16:56.510 --> 16:58.340
Yeah. Of course.

17:02.390 --> 17:04.079
Exciting to be
in the competition, huh?

17:04.130 --> 17:06.430
Instead of sitting up
in the bleachers, like
the last three years?

17:06.480 --> 17:08.089
I guess.

17:08.130 --> 17:10.000
Scary, sure,
but it does feel good

17:10.050 --> 17:11.130
putting our butts
on the line.

17:11.180 --> 17:12.869
You lose 100%

17:12.920 --> 17:14.790
of the hot-dog-eating contests
you don't enter.

17:14.829 --> 17:16.700
Dad, I know
what your bumper sticker is,

17:16.750 --> 17:18.530
and I know
what you're trying to do here.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.319
But college is different.

17:20.359 --> 17:22.670
I mean, you screw up
at community college,
you're out of options.

17:22.710 --> 17:24.190
You're not
gonna screw it up.

17:24.230 --> 17:27.020
I've messed up
a lot of things in my life.

17:27.060 --> 17:28.369
I'm scared
I'll do it again.

17:28.410 --> 17:30.150
Good.
What?

17:30.200 --> 17:31.330
Being scared
means you care.

17:31.370 --> 17:34.980
Maybe -- Maybe that's what's
been missing in the past.

17:35.030 --> 17:36.940
It's the biggest thing
I've ever tried to do.

17:36.980 --> 17:39.030
Contestants, ready position.

17:39.070 --> 17:40.770
Just take it
one step at a time.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.510
Don't worry about the 50
to hopefully 75 hot dogs

17:43.560 --> 17:44.690
you're gonna eat.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.170
Just worry about
the dog in front of you.

17:47.730 --> 17:49.390
And wet the buns.

17:49.430 --> 17:50.130
Eat!

17:52.610 --> 17:54.350
Are we sure this is safe?Oh, my gosh, yes.

17:54.390 --> 17:55.260
The kids love it,
the sheep love it.

17:56.790 --> 17:58.180
And I'm pretty sure
it's too late.

17:58.220 --> 18:01.360
Whoa!Hang on, Cal!
Keep hugging!

18:01.400 --> 18:03.050
Oh, my gosh.
Pam is gonna be so excited.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.970
He's already busting
at a first-grade level.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.540
Better get an X-ray.
You got trampled pretty bad.

18:10.580 --> 18:12.540
Looks like
that ankle's broken.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.240
Really, Jerry?

18:16.810 --> 18:19.030
Haley?
What are you doing here?

18:19.070 --> 18:20.290
Well, you tweeted
you were working,

18:20.330 --> 18:22.250
the water tower's in the back
of your Instagram story,

18:22.290 --> 18:23.210
and you just
left a Yelp rating

18:23.250 --> 18:24.420
for that falafel place
around the corner,

18:24.470 --> 18:25.860
so I figured out
where you were.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.640
Could you please stop
being so obsessed with me?

18:27.690 --> 18:29.210
Wait -- what?

18:29.250 --> 18:30.730
That thing that you said
at the hospital?

18:30.780 --> 18:33.080
How if a person felt lucky
to be in a relationship,

18:33.130 --> 18:34.560
that means that
they couldn't really be happy?

18:34.610 --> 18:36.310
Obviously, you did that

18:36.350 --> 18:37.440
to try and ruin
what I have with Arvin,

18:37.480 --> 18:39.440
because
you're not over me.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.220
I seriously don't know
whether to laugh

18:41.270 --> 18:43.310
or check you
for a spider bite.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.440
I'm sorry that you're
questioning your relationship,

18:45.490 --> 18:46.360
but it's not myfault.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.230
Just admit it!

18:48.270 --> 18:50.450
You said that
to try and get back with me.

18:50.490 --> 18:53.240
Look,
in my heart of hearts --

18:53.280 --> 18:55.450
which does not exist,
by the way --

18:55.500 --> 18:58.280
yeah, I still think about us.
We were great.

18:58.330 --> 19:00.420
- Aha!
- Nuh-ha!

19:00.460 --> 19:01.770
You're the one
who drove across town,

19:01.810 --> 19:03.200
paid $12 for parking

19:03.250 --> 19:06.290
and then an additional $2
for the yellow wristband

19:06.340 --> 19:08.690
for beer
and medical tent access.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.690
It sounds like
you'rethe one who's into me.

19:10.730 --> 19:12.210
You're crazy.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.080
There's no crime
in wondering

19:14.130 --> 19:16.260
if we might still
be good together.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.870
I still see us together
in my mind's eye --

19:18.910 --> 19:20.910
which, by the way,
doesn't exist.I can't hear it again.

19:23.310 --> 19:25.090
Diagnosis -- nothing.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.020
How was the parade?

19:36.060 --> 19:37.500
I had something
more important to do.

19:37.540 --> 19:38.890
Apple pie?

19:38.930 --> 19:40.850
I got a few weird looks
at the drive-through,

19:40.890 --> 19:44.810
but it was worth it to
help keep your tradition alive.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.330
You mean Manny and me?

19:46.380 --> 19:47.510
It's not gonna happen,
because --

19:47.550 --> 19:49.030
I've got that covered,
too.

19:51.420 --> 19:52.600
♪ Ta-da!

19:52.640 --> 19:54.730
Hi, Mom!
I miss you!

19:54.770 --> 19:56.250
Oh, Jay!
That's perfect!

19:56.300 --> 19:57.520
Oh, it's not
perfect yet.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.910
Should we really give
the dangerous job

20:01.960 --> 20:04.310
to my only smart one?

20:07.570 --> 20:09.490
Ohh!

20:09.530 --> 20:12.140
Happy Fourth of July,
Papi!

20:12.180 --> 20:14.140
I'll be home soon --
before you know it.

20:14.190 --> 20:15.530
Jay: "Thomas Jefferson,

20:15.580 --> 20:17.540
who was sort of
the grand marshal of his time,

20:17.580 --> 20:20.320
believed this country should be
a place where people are free

20:20.370 --> 20:22.890
to pursue happiness
and a better life,

20:22.930 --> 20:26.720
where we can set our sights
on the stars

20:26.760 --> 20:28.680
and, with hard work
and determination...

20:29.980 --> 20:32.510
...make the impossible
a reality.

20:32.550 --> 20:33.420
No!

20:33.470 --> 20:35.860
Because Americans
don't run from challenges.

20:35.900 --> 20:37.340
We embrace them.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.560
God bless America.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.430
Hold for applause."

20:43.480 --> 20:45.000
That would've killed,
right?

20:45.040 --> 20:46.650
Bravo!

20:46.700 --> 20:49.440
You know, I gave up a lot today.
You could mean it.

20:53.010 --> 20:54.010
Never too early to start
training for next year.

20:54.050 --> 20:55.750
Let's loosen up first
with some exercises.

20:55.790 --> 20:59.450
Llama lick. Dizzy Gillespie.
Jiffy Pop it.

21:00.490 --> 21:01.970
Hold it.
And out.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.410
Jiffy Pop --Dad, I don't think I can

21:03.450 --> 21:05.450
ever eat
another hot dog again.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.020
I thought
we might feel this way.

21:08.070 --> 21:10.590
- Hey. You there?
- What?

21:10.630 --> 21:13.110
We're having some trouble
getting these bad boys down.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.420
I'm not surprised,
you pathetic losers.

21:15.460 --> 21:17.600
You two disgust me more than
what's in those hot dogs!

21:17.640 --> 21:19.210
What's the hold-up?

21:19.250 --> 21:22.510
Are we saving our bodies
for bikini season, ladies?

21:22.560 --> 21:24.560
- She's good.
- She better be. She's expensive.
