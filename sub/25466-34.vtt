01:27.870 --> 01:29.567
We are here for one reason,

01:29.611 --> 01:31.569

01:31.613 --> 01:33.528

is more important

we lose to the H.I.V.E.

01:41.971 --> 01:44.234
this year we'll just have to
worry about the H.I.V.E.

01:44.278 --> 01:46.323

You know, the kind
that gives you the poops.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.598
You weren't supposed
to tell anyone.

02:00.642 --> 02:02.426
How was I gonna keep
poop yogurt secret?

02:02.470 --> 02:05.168
How? It's yogurt
that makes you poop!

It's a poop-making yogurt!

02:15.439 --> 02:17.572
Anyway, since I'm flying solo,

I thought I could join

until you let me.

what it takes to be a Titan.

Of course not.

03:02.399 --> 03:05.228
Then how are you
going to be a Teen Titan?

03:05.272 --> 03:07.274

By cheating?

03:15.630 --> 03:18.198
By giving you another paddler.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.329
That's what I thought.

Now, if you'll excuse us,

[whooping] Yes!

04:15.864 --> 04:18.127
Maybe we should just add
Bumblebee to the team.

04:18.170 --> 04:21.739
Oh, I do very much like
the idea of the sixth Titan.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.828
We do not need a sixth Titan.

What are we,

to keep things interesting?

I mean, let's be real.

can I say "whatever"

04:32.272 --> 04:33.142
and still get a laugh?

04:33.185 --> 04:34.665
It wasn't funny to begin with!

04:34.709 --> 04:36.580
-Whatever.
-[laughs]

04:36.624 --> 04:38.669
Perhaps adding the bee
who bumbles

04:38.713 --> 04:40.236
could give us the new life.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.847
Yeah. Also, six
be better than five, yo.

supposed to be?

08:16.974 --> 08:18.628
This isn't the sea.

08:18.672 --> 08:19.629
We're in the forest.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.805
On the plank with ye!

08:21.849 --> 08:24.329
Enjoy your swim
in the briny deep!

08:24.373 --> 08:25.461
Yah-har-har!

08:25.505 --> 08:26.331
Really?

08:26.375 --> 08:27.550
-[screams]
-[water splashes]

08:27.594 --> 08:29.857
[Teen Titans grunting]

08:32.076 --> 08:34.644
Har-har!
Being a pirate
is the best.

08:34.688 --> 08:36.907
Now nothing can stop us
from winning this race.

08:36.951 --> 08:39.257
-Ha-har-har-har!
-[growling]

08:39.301 --> 08:40.215
Bear!

08:40.258 --> 08:41.608
-[all screaming]
-[bear growling]

08:41.651 --> 08:43.697
Uh, I keep forgetting
we're in the woods.

08:43.740 --> 08:46.308
-[H.I.V.E. laughing
and cheering]
-[Bumblebee buzzing]

08:46.351 --> 08:48.528

-[bees buzzing]

08:49.790 --> 08:50.965
[roaring]

08:52.706 --> 08:54.490
[all laughing]

08:54.534 --> 08:55.578
[Cyborg] It be over.

08:55.622 --> 08:56.840
Yah-har.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.625
Looks like we can't win,

08:58.668 --> 08:59.843
even as pirates.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.193
Guys, you don't need
to be pirates.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.456
Winning this canoe race
is about teamwork,

09:04.500 --> 09:06.894
and the Teen Titans
are the best team here.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.591
You are all so different,

09:08.635 --> 09:10.593
but you understand
each other completely.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.727
When you work together,
nothing is impossible.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.424
[all cheering]

09:22.997 --> 09:24.302
We'll never catch them.

09:24.346 --> 09:26.478
Them H.I.V.E.s
is gonna wins again!

09:26.522 --> 09:28.002
Not this year.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.918
Hey, H.I.V.E., eat this!

09:34.443 --> 09:35.749
Ew, sticky.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.925
Ugh, why'd you
cover us with honey?

09:37.968 --> 09:40.841
[growling]

09:40.884 --> 09:41.885
Not the bears!

09:41.929 --> 09:44.758
[Jinx screaming]

09:44.801 --> 09:46.716
[Gizmo] Not the waterfall!

09:46.760 --> 09:48.500
[all screaming]

09:51.242 --> 09:53.418
[Teen Titans cheering]

09:53.462 --> 09:55.029
Confetti!

09:55.072 --> 09:56.813
[all cheering]

09:56.857 --> 09:59.468
Bumblebee, I didn't think
you had it in you,

09:59.511 --> 10:01.775
but you really
sent the H.I.V.E.
over that waterfall.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.778
We could not have done
the winning without you.

10:04.821 --> 10:07.084
You're not disappointed
in my terrible actions?

10:07.128 --> 10:08.520
No way, mama.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.871
You's a degenerate
just likes us.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.524
Maybe making you
the sixth Titan

10:12.568 --> 10:14.483
won't be a desperate,
chemistry-ruining stunt
after all.

10:14.526 --> 10:16.311
Welcome to the team,
Bumblebee.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.748
What happened
to there being
no good teams of six?

10:18.792 --> 10:19.706
[gasps]

10:19.749 --> 10:22.056
I just remembered one.

10:22.099 --> 10:23.361
Friends!

10:23.405 --> 10:25.625
