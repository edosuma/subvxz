My father was diagnosed
manic depressive in 1967.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.939
He'd been going around Cambridge
in a fake beard

01:04.105 --> 01:06.984
calling himself
Jesus John Harvard.

01:07.151 --> 01:08.694
When he got better,

01:08.861 --> 01:10.571
he started working in
public television in Boston.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.281
He met my mother there.

01:12.448 --> 01:14.408
He walked up
and took her picture.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.369
On their first date,

01:17.536 --> 01:19.663
he took her on a driving tour
of New England

01:19.830 --> 01:22.124
and told her all about
his nervous breakdowns.

01:22.291 --> 01:25.336
She didn't care.
She said it was a crazy time.

01:25.503 --> 01:28.130
Half the people they knew
were going bananas.

01:28.297 --> 01:32.968
So they got married and they
had me... and then my sister.

01:33.135 --> 01:36.847
We were happy.
I know there is more to it than that.

Daddy!
We have to go to school.

01:47.066 --> 01:48.818
Not today.
We're celebrating!

01:48.984 --> 01:50.820
- Celebrating what?
- I got fired!

01:50.986 --> 01:52.947
What do you mean?
You just got that job!

01:53.114 --> 01:55.199
Darlings, look around you!

01:55.366 --> 01:58.494
We walk out of our house
into this beautiful world!

01:58.661 --> 02:00.621
But what happened
with your job?

02:00.788 --> 02:03.833
Typical workplace politics.
Who knows who pushed who first?

02:03.999 --> 02:07.378
Either way, I got into a scuffle
with my boss. Forget that.

02:07.545 --> 02:10.005
Let's find some mushrooms
and make an omelette for Mommy.

02:10.172 --> 02:13.050
Does Mommy know
you got fired?

02:40.786 --> 02:42.997
It's magical.

02:43.164 --> 02:46.375
Mommy's gonna be so happy
I kept you out of school.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.377
Get in the car, girls.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.758
Maggie! Where are you going?
What are you doing?

02:54.925 --> 02:56.725
- What's with the suitcases?
- Get in the car.

02:56.844 --> 03:00.431
Maggie! I'm not manic. I'm fine.

03:00.598 --> 03:02.433
I just pulled out the canoe.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.393
I thought we could
paddle up to Lincoln Park

03:04.560 --> 03:06.312
and forage for a picnic.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.147
Isn't it too cold
for a picnic?

03:08.314 --> 03:09.356
Maggie!

03:09.523 --> 03:11.025
I am a man!

03:11.192 --> 03:14.361
Men like to live free!

03:14.528 --> 03:18.490
That's what we do, Maggie.
To hunt and mate!

03:18.657 --> 03:21.994
That's what we do!
That's why we have balls!

03:22.161 --> 03:24.205
It's OK. It's OK.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.832
Ah!

03:28.417 --> 03:30.336
It's gonna be OK.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.645
I'm sorry.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.570
He's sitting on the ground

03:56.737 --> 03:58.656
and all he's wearing
is a bathing suit.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.659
Your father's very sick right now.
He's not himself.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.287
He looks freezing.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.502
Girls, look at me.

04:11.669 --> 04:13.963
I don't want you
telling your friends

04:14.129 --> 04:16.214
or your teachers
about any of this.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.635
We know Daddy's a good person,

04:19.802 --> 04:22.554
and we know
that he would never hurt us,

04:22.721 --> 04:25.557
but it's hard
for people to understand that.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.434
And it's very sad.

04:34.358 --> 04:37.611
"Dear Daddy, I took a walk through
the woods today and said goodbye."

04:37.778 --> 04:40.990
"Mommy had to sell
the car, but we got to go to Dairy Queen."

04:41.156 --> 04:44.159
"I hate that we have to
move to an apartment in the city."

04:44.326 --> 04:47.079
"I got a vanilla saucer
dipped in chocolate. It was so good."

04:47.246 --> 04:50.166
"Mommy says Bohemia is
over, which I don't understand,

04:50.332 --> 04:52.501
"but I think it has something
to do with making money."

04:52.668 --> 04:56.171
<i>"Lots of love, Faith Feather Stuart."</i>

04:56.338 --> 04:59.132
<i>"Amelia Lavender Stuart. "</i>

05:14.648 --> 05:17.276
Babies!

05:18.944 --> 05:22.072
- Hi.
- Want to go see Daddy?

05:22.239 --> 05:24.366
Go on. Go see Daddy.

05:26.201 --> 05:29.038
Little.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.790
Big Little.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.335
- And I'm feeling much better.
- You are?

05:34.501 --> 05:37.588
- Yeah.
- Your stomach is really big.

05:37.755 --> 05:41.967
Oh... That's the medication
they put me on.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.844
It doesn't hurt. Hit it.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.306
Go on. Pound on it.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.016
Jesus!

05:50.100 --> 05:51.935
You gotta be careful.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.813
You never want to do that when
Harry Houdini's not looking,

05:54.980 --> 05:57.274
'cause that's how
they killed him.

05:58.567 --> 06:02.237
- Hi, handsome.
- I got you flowers.

06:02.404 --> 06:07.576
You're so beautiful.
You look like your mommy.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.453
You need help?

06:16.710 --> 06:18.504
How are you feeling?

06:18.670 --> 06:20.214
Mmm...

06:22.091 --> 06:25.636
- I feel great.
- You looked better last week.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.680
Are they adjusting
the medication?

06:28.847 --> 06:31.683
Yeah, they tried
something new on me. It's...

06:31.850 --> 06:33.852
- I want to sit down.
- OK.

06:35.687 --> 06:38.399
I want to be home
with my family.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.317
You will, Daddy.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.444
I love you.

06:42.611 --> 06:45.531
- We love you.
- I love you too, Daddy.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.908
- Love you too.
- Thank you.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.667
The lights on the roof
come in our window at night

06:56.834 --> 06:58.210
and it's too bright.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.087
I can't sleep.
It's bright as day.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.964
- I'll make a curtain.
- They're huge security lights.

07:02.131 --> 07:04.258
- Like you would see at a prison.
- Amelia!

07:04.425 --> 07:06.635
I also wish we could have stayed
out in the country,

07:06.802 --> 07:08.303
but there are
no good jobs in Sudbury.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.013
Your job here isn't good.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.558
I'm gonna find a better one.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.184
Why can't Daddy
live here with us?

07:14.351 --> 07:15.951
I hate visiting him
at the halfway house.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.604
It's almost as bad
as the hospital.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.148
Daddy's still recovering
from his breakdown.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.774
He's a way better cook
than you.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.701
Faith!

07:30.868 --> 07:32.244
What is that?

07:32.411 --> 07:35.122
It's a flower. It's pretty.

07:53.182 --> 07:57.394
♪ Police officer,
how can it be?

07:57.561 --> 08:01.899
♪ You can arrest everybody
but cruel Stack O'Lee

08:02.065 --> 08:06.570
♪ That bad man
Oh, cruel Stack O'Lee... ♪

08:20.417 --> 08:23.003
My father lives here.

08:26.924 --> 08:28.675
How did you know
how to get here?

08:28.842 --> 08:30.427
Came all the way
from school?

08:30.594 --> 08:34.097
- So, what's your plan?
- What's my plan?

08:35.224 --> 08:37.100
Mmm...

08:37.267 --> 08:40.270
My plan is...

08:40.437 --> 08:42.438
...to get out of
this halfway house.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.942
- That's... that's number one.
- I like it.

08:45.108 --> 08:48.946
Then I'll get a job
and an apartment.

08:49.112 --> 08:53.575
And then you girls can come visit me
and have sleepovers

08:53.742 --> 08:58.330
and I'll make crepes
for breakfast and dinner.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.791
And then...

09:00.958 --> 09:07.589
...I'll move back in with you
and Faithie... and Mommy.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.509
That is, if Mommy will have me.

09:13.679 --> 09:16.181
I feel like Lucy
visiting Mr Tumnus.

09:16.348 --> 09:19.226
Oh! That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.436
Mommy says you have
a drinking problem.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.526
I think if you could stop drinking
and take your lithium,

09:27.693 --> 09:29.236
then Mommy
would let you come home.

09:29.403 --> 09:32.072
Do you actually think
Mommy should be

09:32.239 --> 09:33.657
confiding in you this way?

09:33.824 --> 09:36.326
Yes.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.997
Could we please go back to
being Lucy and Mr Tumnus?

09:45.085 --> 09:46.503
- These too.
- OK.

09:49.172 --> 09:50.966
Keller Brothers.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.678
Hey. It's for you.
No personal calls.

09:54.845 --> 09:56.638
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- This is a job!

09:56.805 --> 09:59.308
OK. OK. I'm sorry about that.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.435
Sorry. Sorry.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.604
- Hello?
- It's me.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.148
Amelia came to see me
at the halfway house today.

10:06.315 --> 10:09.735
Everything's fine.
I'm taking her home to your apartment.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.866
- How did she get there?
- Walked.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.076
All the way from school?

10:20.203 --> 10:22.080
I know - I think
we should try and find

10:22.247 --> 10:24.166
a therapist
for her to talk to.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.840
She's gotten so good.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.676
- That's fantastic!
- That's great, sweetpea.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.139
How's the job?

10:39.306 --> 10:41.224
Oh, the job.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.894
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.900
- Oh.
- Oh!

10:51.318 --> 10:53.362
- Forgot the laundry.
- We'll get it!

10:54.863 --> 10:56.531
Faithie!

11:06.375 --> 11:09.336
And creamy spinach.
I just love spinach.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.922
Creamy little things are good.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.549
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.052
You guys go to Lincoln?

11:17.219 --> 11:18.762
No. We go to Peabody.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.889
Peabody's the best public school
in our city.

11:21.056 --> 11:24.267
We are not
in the Peabody School district.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.434
If you live here,
you're supposed to go to Lincoln,

11:26.561 --> 11:30.190
a school that is totally, 100% terrible.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.360
Unless you like getting
your 'A' kicked by Irish kids.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.612
I don't want to
get my 'A' kicked.

11:35.779 --> 11:38.407
- Honey, nobody does.
- Well, we go to Peabody.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.992
You don't get it.
What you're doing is illegal.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.370
And it's not fair.
It's not at all fair.

11:43.537 --> 11:47.374
- You guys are gonna go to jail.
- 'Bye!

11:47.541 --> 11:50.293
What if somebody asks me
where I live? I don't want to lie.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.546
Amelia, Peabody's the best
public school in the city.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.840
I don't care.
I don't want to lie.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.726
You're not lying, sweetheart.
Mommy's lying.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.720
I don't want to go to Lincoln!
They said we'll get beat up.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.222
Don't worry about that.
I'm gonna teach you how to fight.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.015
What if my teacher finds out
I'm lying?

12:04.182 --> 12:06.643
Miss Hendricks loves you.
You're her best student.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.354
They said we're gonna get
our 'A' kicked by Irish kids!

12:09.521 --> 12:10.897
- You're not gonna get...
- Who said that?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.566
You'll be kicking 'A'!

12:12.733 --> 12:15.193
If you wanted us to go to
the Peabody School so bad,

12:15.360 --> 12:17.696
why didn't we move into
the Peabody School district?

12:17.863 --> 12:19.865
Amelia, because
we cannot afford it.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.075
We are lucky we got
a rent-controlled apartment.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.829
- But Daddy's family is so rich!
- Yes, but we have no money!

12:25.996 --> 12:29.249
I send my résumé out every day
and I get nothing.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.710
I've just spent my last $12.

12:31.877 --> 12:34.755
You girls want to be poor
and have a bad education?

12:36.840 --> 12:39.009
Seconds, anyone?

12:42.846 --> 12:45.223
Thank you, Cam,
for this delicious dinner.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.642
It could be like this
every night.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.395
Yes, that would be nice,
but I need a husband, not a wife.

12:50.562 --> 12:53.523
I would like to be a husband,
but my wife won't let me.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.400
Your wife would let you
be a husband

12:55.567 --> 12:58.028
if you made it possible for her
to just be your wife.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.363
He wants her to be a wife,
but she insists

13:00.530 --> 13:03.033
on being a husband
who makes me be his wife.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.918
What did he say?

13:55.085 --> 13:58.630
He said that we don't live
in the Peabody School district

13:58.797 --> 14:01.591
and that you and Faith
have to go to Lincoln.

14:01.758 --> 14:05.470
- I'm so sorry, Mommy.
- Honey, don't.

14:05.637 --> 14:09.516
Please don't cry, Amelia.
Don't apologise to me.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.185
He asked where we lived
and I didn't know what to say.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.938
I know. I know.
You did the right thing.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.023
I never wanted you to lie.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.693
He said it was illegal
what we were doing.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.696
I know. I just...

14:24.447 --> 14:27.117
I guess I...
I wasn't thinking, honey.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.619
I wanted you and Faith
to go to the best school.

14:29.786 --> 14:33.665
What if Faithie gets beat up
and it's all because of me?

14:33.832 --> 14:36.751
Faith is not gonna get beat up.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.461
She bites.

14:39.713 --> 14:43.633
Sleeping bags, pyjamas,
stuffed animals, books,

14:43.800 --> 14:45.468
changes of clothes -
what am I forgetting?

14:45.635 --> 14:48.555
- Toothbrushes.
- I bought toothbrushes.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.042
They can keep 'em
at my apartment.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.225
And I found
these two cardboard boxes.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.185
I set 'em up like beds.
They're gonna flip.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.021
They're so excited.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.827
- Do you want some tea?
- Yes, please. Oh.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.818
During the day, they can
turn them on their sides

14:59.900 --> 15:01.276
and they become puppet theatres.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.612
You're going to have
so much fun.

15:03.778 --> 15:07.073
- Do you want some toast?
- Please.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.579
Now that I got my own place,
Maggie, I mean,

15:12.746 --> 15:15.665
I'm happy to stop by
and pick up the kids any time,

15:15.832 --> 15:17.459
have 'em stay over.

15:17.626 --> 15:19.753
- Thank you.
- There's room for you too.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.672
Just kidding.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.799
Not until you're ready.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.052
- Oh, it's good tea. Cam?
- Mmm?

15:27.218 --> 15:30.764
Um...
I got into business school.

15:32.223 --> 15:35.101
Maggie Stuart,
you are some punkins!

15:36.853 --> 15:40.273
I wish I had some of that
bourgeois Midwestern can-do.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.195
A scholarship... to Columbia.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.198
Wait. You can't take the girls
to New York.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.241
No, of course not-
I can't even afford

15:50.408 --> 15:52.452
my own studio apartment
in New York.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.038
So, what about the girls?

15:56.915 --> 15:59.459
OK. Here's my proposal.

16:00.627 --> 16:04.047
I can get my degree in 18 months
if I do a summer session.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.341
And Jenny's mom can rent me

16:06.508 --> 16:07.926
a very small room
in her apartment.

16:08.093 --> 16:10.387
So I go to New York.

16:10.553 --> 16:15.183
You move in here with the girls
and you take care of them.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.688
- Me?
- Yes, you.

16:19.854 --> 16:22.649
You miss them.
And they miss you so much, Cam.

16:22.816 --> 16:27.988
I can get my MBA in 18 months,
and then I come back to Boston,

16:28.154 --> 16:31.074
I get a job and I move back in.

16:31.241 --> 16:34.494
But... but... but... I mean, yes.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.496
Yes.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.458
- I know it is a lot.
- No, no, no, no, no.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.544
- But... but...
- Uh... uh... uh...

16:42.711 --> 16:45.046
You know, the doctor even said
that I would be...

16:45.213 --> 16:47.653
I suppose it'd be good for me
to have... to have some purpose.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.010
A routine.
That's what the doctor said.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.721
- That's exactly what you need.
- Yes, yes, a routine.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.889
- Putting food on the table.
- Yes.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.726
Taking them to school
every... morning.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.853
Putting them to bed
every night.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.355
Making sure they brush
their teeth and their hair

17:02.522 --> 17:03.940
twice a day.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.483
The laundry.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.444
My God, that sounds like a lot.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.989
Cam, it is a lot.

17:11.156 --> 17:14.451
But we are sinking
deeper and deeper into a hole.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.911
Cam, I have to do something.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.414
- Do you understand?
- Oh, Maggie, you're right.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.750
I mean,
that new school of theirs

17:21.915 --> 17:23.835
certainly feels like
a bit of a reformatory.

17:24.002 --> 17:27.088
It's grim. And you and I
went to good schools.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.883
- We had piano lessons.
- I never had any lessons.

17:30.050 --> 17:33.136
But you learned to fence
and you learned to ski and play chess...

17:33.303 --> 17:35.584
But I never had lessons.
My family taught me those things.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.183
The point is, Cameron,
you and I,

17:38.349 --> 17:41.811
we had the best education,
and I want that for our children.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.148
I do too, but 18 months,
that's a lot of routine.

17:45.315 --> 17:49.569
You can do it. And I'll come
every weekend to help you.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.072
- Every weekend?
- Every weekend.

17:52.238 --> 17:55.116
- And you'll stay here with us?
- Of course. Yes.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.951
So we'll be
like a family again?

18:00.622 --> 18:02.415
Yes.

18:05.168 --> 18:08.296
I'm afraid we need to intervene
on our son's behalf and say no.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.757
- He's not up to the task.
- I know he can do it.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.343
The doctor says I need
more responsibilities, not less.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.762
You're a man. Even if you could,
why would you want to?

18:15.929 --> 18:18.264
We just don't want you
to tax yourself, darling boy.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.183
We met with Dr Wendell.

18:20.350 --> 18:22.631
He says Cam made an excellent
recovery from his breakdown,

18:22.769 --> 18:24.771
and he thinks
that he can do it.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.440
Is this something to do
with feminism?

18:27.607 --> 18:30.360
We're living
at the poverty level.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.278
The girls are going
to a terrible school.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.925
Our children went
to the best schools.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.406
It didn't add up to much.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.408
Our children are delightful!

18:37.575 --> 18:39.702
Absolutely, but not one of them
is self-supporting.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.038
Well, Murray, lest you forget,
neither are we.

18:42.205 --> 18:43.623
I think it's admirable
what Maggie's doing.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.458
I agree.
Very commendable.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.419
Don't we have some silver
or some crystal we could sell?

18:48.586 --> 18:50.046
That wouldn't even pay
for this meal.

18:50.213 --> 18:53.633
No. No, no, Maggie Stuart.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.636
- You cannot leave your family.
- Pauline, I'm desperate.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.430
We have no money.

18:59.597 --> 19:02.058
Here, like... like...
What... what is this?

19:02.225 --> 19:04.185
We've been doing this
for 45 minutes.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.980
If you put this here, you have
more room for everything else.

19:07.147 --> 19:10.525
Why does he keep rearranging
everything? It was fine before.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.236
We have to go.
We're heading into wretched traffic.

19:13.403 --> 19:15.864
I know we have to leave.
I'm saying goodbye to the girls.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.574
Sorry, Peter.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.539
Me-me. Don't be upset.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.624
Honey.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.501
Who is this wimp?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.795
He's Carol Webber's cousin.

19:30.962 --> 19:33.131
He's moving back to New York
with his mom.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.300
- He's making you drive?
- It's probably better if I do.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.146
Cam, take a picture of us.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.761
- Hey!
- Come on. Cam!

19:40.013 --> 19:42.098
Mommy loves you.

19:42.265 --> 19:45.727
So we have something to remember
your mother by when she's gone.

19:45.894 --> 19:50.315
Faithie, listen to your mother.
Everyone smile.

19:50.481 --> 19:52.358
Hey!

19:52.525 --> 19:55.111
You're saying goodbye
to your daughters.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.906
What kind of a cold-hearted SOB
honks the horn?

20:03.036 --> 20:05.205
I know. Thank you.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.999
- This is big. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:08.166 --> 20:11.211
I just wish I hadn't dressed
like a big green bug.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.254
Go. Seriously.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.590
Before I kick the living shit
out of this guy. Here.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.467
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.177
- Girls.
- I'll miss you.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.221
- I know. I know.
- Say goodbye.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.182
Say goodbye to your mother.
Come on, darling.

20:27.310 --> 20:29.646
That's my wife. We love you.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.522
- I love you.
- We love you.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.233
'Bye.

20:34.317 --> 20:35.860
'Bye!

20:38.404 --> 20:40.324
My brother had sex
in this van last night.

20:40.490 --> 20:41.741
Oh, God!

20:42.784 --> 20:44.661
We'll have to make
a lot of stops.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.871
I have a very small bladder.

20:47.038 --> 20:49.082
Maggie! Maggie!

20:49.249 --> 20:51.251
Take the Wilbur Cross Parkway!

20:51.417 --> 20:53.044
- When we went to Tom and...
- Cam!

20:53.211 --> 20:55.213
- ...Linda's wedding.
- What?

20:55.380 --> 20:57.340
Remember, when we were going
to Torn and Linda's wedding

20:57.507 --> 21:00.385
and we were afraid we were gonna
be late and took the back roads,

21:00.551 --> 21:02.178
we got there
in the nick of time?

21:02.345 --> 21:04.180
- I don't know if I remember.
- The Wilbur Cross Parkway!

21:04.347 --> 21:05.723
At New Haven! Hey!

21:05.890 --> 21:08.935
I'll kill you! At New Haven.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.862
Shoot across the 34 West
to the Wilbur Cross!

21:10.979 --> 21:13.356
That turns into Merritt Parkway!

21:13.523 --> 21:15.108
- OK.
- You can avoid Bridgeport.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.110
- OK!
- The trees are twice as green!

21:17.277 --> 21:19.362
- Fine!
- I love you!

21:19.529 --> 21:21.072
Who was that?

21:31.541 --> 21:33.751
We can go catch a movie.

21:36.004 --> 21:39.841
We could drive out to Plum Island
and look for sea glass.

21:42.093 --> 21:43.845
We could go to
the Museum of Fine Arts

21:44.012 --> 21:46.389
and look at
Great-Grandpapa's portrait.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.559
Why is his portrait
hanging in a museum?

21:49.726 --> 21:51.269
Because a very important artist

21:51.436 --> 21:53.563
named John Singer Sergeant
painted it.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.565
- Why?
- Why?

21:55.732 --> 21:58.526
Don't you know who we are?

22:00.111 --> 22:03.323
That is where your
Great-Grandmother Gaga grew up.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.950
- In that whole house?
- The whole thing.

22:06.117 --> 22:08.161
It's the grandest house
on Beacon Hill.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.371
Designed by Bulfinch,
a very famous architect.

22:10.538 --> 22:12.582
- How did they get so rich?
- Mmm.

22:12.749 --> 22:14.917
Railroads.

22:15.084 --> 22:19.005
Your great-great-grandfather
was once the richest man in Boston.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.465
So how come we're so poor?

22:20.631 --> 22:23.885
Well, all of that money
was put into a trust.

22:24.052 --> 22:27.680
Nobody could touch it,
except for your great-grandmother.

22:27.847 --> 22:32.894
She controls it all, and she decides
when to give who what.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.646
It's hard to explain.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.484
Would you like
to see the inside?

22:39.650 --> 22:41.444
Are we allowed?

22:41.611 --> 22:43.654
We can't just walk up
and knock on people's doors.

22:43.821 --> 22:47.492
Sweetheart. It's Boston.
They're practically expecting us.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.372
Your great-great-grandmother
and grandfather

22:52.538 --> 22:54.874
entertained
the King and Queen of England.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.251
At this table,
the Queen of England

22:57.418 --> 22:59.295
choked on a chicken bone
while she was here.

22:59.462 --> 23:01.422
Uh...

23:01.589 --> 23:04.092
- Mr Fabrini will be right out.
- Thank you.

23:04.258 --> 23:06.844
Now, upstairs here,
there's a ballroom.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.888
And had these
huge fancy-dress...

23:09.055 --> 23:12.767
- Can I help you?
- Hi. Cam Stuart.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.894
My great-grandmother
grew up in this house, and...

23:15.019 --> 23:16.771
I wanted to show it
to my girls.

23:16.938 --> 23:19.690
I'm sorry, Mr Stuart. This is my home.
I don't give tours.

23:21.234 --> 23:24.028
Mr Fabrini,
this house has been in my family

23:24.195 --> 23:25.905
for more than five generations.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.824
My great-great-grandfather
was born in this house

23:27.990 --> 23:29.742
on Boxing Day 1832.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.245
And would your
great-great-grandfather

23:32.412 --> 23:34.122
give tours
to anyone who came along?

23:34.288 --> 23:36.249
Certainly, especially if
they had a personal connection

23:36.416 --> 23:39.127
that went back
over five generations, yes.

23:39.293 --> 23:43.256
- Then he's a better man than me.
- Better man than I.

23:43.423 --> 23:47.009
Obviously, you're not in control
of your emotions today,

23:47.176 --> 23:50.638
so I will return on another day
to show my daughters

23:50.805 --> 23:53.266
what is rightfully
their birthright to see.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.518
- Right.
- Sure, Mr Fabrini.

23:56.644 --> 24:00.022
- That was so embarrassing!
- Don't be embarrassed.

24:00.189 --> 24:01.983
- He should be embarrassed!
- No!

24:02.150 --> 24:03.790
You're the one
that should be embarrassed!

24:03.818 --> 24:05.903
Me? I'm not embarrassed!

24:06.070 --> 24:08.823
- That man is an asshole!
- You are an asshole!

24:25.923 --> 24:27.925
We want you to come home.

24:28.092 --> 24:30.094
I'll be home in 12 days.

24:30.261 --> 24:32.263
We want you
to come home right now.

24:32.430 --> 24:36.267
Honey. I know it is
a big adjustment. I know.

24:36.434 --> 24:38.269
Why aren't you coming home
this Friday?

24:38.436 --> 24:40.521
You said you'd come home
every single weekend.

24:40.688 --> 24:43.191
- That's what you said.
- I know that.

24:43.357 --> 24:45.401
But I have registration
and orientation.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.570
Next weekend
is really not that far away.

24:47.737 --> 24:50.364
- I love you.
- We love you too.

24:50.531 --> 24:52.658
'Bye, girls. 'Bye.

24:56.496 --> 24:58.873
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

24:59.040 --> 25:02.752
Daddy, wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Daddy! Wake up!

25:02.919 --> 25:05.505
We slept too long
and we're gonna be late for school!

25:05.671 --> 25:07.840
Quickly! Amelia,
don't forget your backpack!

25:08.007 --> 25:10.092
We're gonna miss the elevator!

25:10.259 --> 25:11.761
Hold on! Hold on! OK.

25:11.928 --> 25:14.013
Oh. Good morning.
Thank you. Wait.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.556
- You're Maggie's friend.
- Yeah.

25:15.723 --> 25:17.850
- Hi. Cam.
- Hi. Becca. Kyle's mother.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.686
Pleasure. Nice to meet you.
Amelia, let's go!

25:20.853 --> 25:22.605
- I hate being late for school.
- Don't worry, punkins.

25:22.772 --> 25:24.292
You won't be late.
Have some breakfast.

25:24.357 --> 25:26.484
The most important meal
of the day.

25:26.651 --> 25:28.194
Amelia! Let's go!

25:28.361 --> 25:30.112
- You know, I just have to say...
- Yes?

25:30.279 --> 25:32.119
My ex-husband would never do
what you're doing.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.242
- I think it's so evolved.
- You do?

25:34.408 --> 25:37.036
Absolutely - I mean, most men
would be completely emasculated

25:37.203 --> 25:39.455
by having their wife go off
to be the breadwinner.

25:40.790 --> 25:43.834
Oh. Thank you.

25:48.214 --> 25:51.801
OK. Go, go, go!
You're gonna be late!

25:53.177 --> 25:55.930
I love you! Do you want me
to pick you up after school?

25:56.097 --> 25:58.266
- No!
- I'll be here at 3:00!

25:58.432 --> 26:00.309
No!

26:11.487 --> 26:12.863
What...

26:13.030 --> 26:14.657
What the hell...?

26:14.824 --> 26:17.785
- What?
- Where were you?

26:17.952 --> 26:20.079
You said you were gonna
pick us up at 3:00!

26:20.246 --> 26:22.248
The car wouldn't start.

26:22.415 --> 26:26.460
You girls want to learn how to
adjust a 4-jet carburettor?

26:26.627 --> 26:29.046
It takes two screwdrivers.
You could do it together.

26:29.213 --> 26:30.881
- No.
- Not really.

26:35.595 --> 26:37.471
Just don't be helpless.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.265
When I get that engine fixed,

26:39.432 --> 26:41.601
we're driving that thing
to Mexico.

26:43.144 --> 26:45.062
- Who's that?
- Ruth-Ann.

26:45.229 --> 26:46.939
Please don't introduce yourself.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.275
- Why not?
- 'Cause you talk too much and...

26:49.442 --> 26:51.193
I'm just being friendly.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.903
Don't you want to know
your neighbours?

26:53.070 --> 26:54.989
We live in a world
with other people. Hi!

26:55.156 --> 26:56.907
Cam Stuart.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.909
Yes, Maggie told me.

26:59.076 --> 27:00.828
Welcome to Wieland Manor.
Ruth-Ann McKay.

27:00.995 --> 27:02.371
- Hello, girls.
- Hi.

27:02.538 --> 27:04.040
Can we help you
with your bags?

27:04.206 --> 27:05.875
Are you kidding?

27:06.042 --> 27:07.543
- Well, stand aside, Ruth-Ann.
- Oh, thank you.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.211
See, girls?

27:09.378 --> 27:11.339
People appreciate
a little kindness.

27:11.505 --> 27:13.507
That's all I'm talking about.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.218
I got that.

27:19.013 --> 27:20.389
Hi. Cam Stuart.

27:20.556 --> 27:23.351
Hi. Cam Stuart. I'm new here.

27:23.517 --> 27:25.061
Who was that?

27:26.145 --> 27:27.855
Hi. Cam Stuart.
I'm new in the building.

27:28.022 --> 27:30.232
Apartment 32.

27:30.399 --> 27:32.276
Here we are.

27:32.443 --> 27:34.695
Do you need any help
putting them away?

27:34.862 --> 27:37.823
No, this is fine.
We'll just put the bags down.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.368
Are you sure?
We're happy to help.

27:40.534 --> 27:43.454
No. This has been so helpful.
Thank you.

27:43.621 --> 27:46.791
Do you need anything moved?
A desk or something like that?

27:46.957 --> 27:50.878
No, I'm... I'm...
I'm happy with where my desk is.

27:51.045 --> 27:52.845
I find mixing an arrangement
freshens a space.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.257
No, thank you.
I have to start dinner.

27:55.424 --> 27:57.301
- So... if you'll excuse me.
- Sure.

27:57.468 --> 27:59.387
Do you want an onion chopped
or something?

27:59.553 --> 28:01.472
I'm not using onions tonight.

28:03.224 --> 28:04.725
- What's wrong with you?
- Why?

28:04.892 --> 28:06.644
You made her
slam the door in your face.

28:06.811 --> 28:10.147
- She had to cook dinner.
- She had to get rid of you!

28:10.314 --> 28:12.858
What are you talking about?
I was being a good neighbour!

28:13.025 --> 28:14.735
You're an annoying neighbour!

28:14.902 --> 28:17.196
People will see you
and run in the other direction!

28:17.363 --> 28:19.448
No, people are gonna see me
and run towards me!

28:19.615 --> 28:21.992
Because I'm gonna show them
that I am the kind of man

28:22.159 --> 28:24.161
that is willing
to move heavy furniture

28:24.328 --> 28:28.040
or clear out a storage locker
or give them a ride to the airport!

28:28.207 --> 28:30.876
Because I'm a good neighbour!
This is bullshit!

28:32.378 --> 28:34.296
You don't know anything.

28:53.190 --> 28:56.235
I learned how to cook this
on a Norwegian steamer

28:56.402 --> 28:57.987
heading down the Amazon.

28:59.655 --> 29:01.282
When did you do that?

29:01.449 --> 29:04.368
Summer after I got
kicked out of Harvard.

29:04.535 --> 29:07.121
Thought you got
kicked out of Exeter.

29:07.288 --> 29:10.541
I got kicked out of both,
for very different reasons...

29:13.669 --> 29:15.629
So I'm on my way
to my Ec 10 exam,

29:15.796 --> 29:19.300
and I hear this bagpipe music,
so I follow it into the Square,

29:19.467 --> 29:22.803
and there's this street musician
playing Scottish ballads.

29:22.970 --> 29:24.889
He's got his hat out
and people are walking by

29:25.055 --> 29:26.474
and they're
putting money in it,

29:26.640 --> 29:28.225
and I think,
"That's a good idea."

29:28.392 --> 29:30.811
So I sit down next to him,
I put my hat out

29:30.978 --> 29:33.063
and I start singing
in my best Scottish brogue.

29:33.230 --> 29:36.275
And I know all the words.
And he tells me to scram.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.152
Because he didn't ask you
to sing

29:38.319 --> 29:39.945
and he wanted
to make all the money.

29:40.112 --> 29:43.908
Exactly, so we exchange a few words
and the bastard jumps me!

29:44.074 --> 29:45.993
This scrawny little bastard,
he jumps me!

29:46.160 --> 29:47.995
And we get into
this major brawl

29:48.162 --> 29:49.663
right there
on top of his bagpipes,

29:49.830 --> 29:51.874
and I got so excited,
I shit my pants.

29:52.041 --> 29:55.669
Ew!

29:55.836 --> 29:59.465
Well, needless to say,
I didn't make it to my exam.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.634
And they kicked you out
for missing one exam?

30:01.801 --> 30:06.680
No. The semester after that,
I registered for 75 courses.

30:06.847 --> 30:08.390
And that's when they determined

30:08.557 --> 30:10.851
that I wasn't exactly
Harvard material.

30:47.638 --> 30:49.974
Jesus Christ!

31:17.835 --> 31:19.879
Girls? Girls?

31:20.045 --> 31:22.381
I'm gonna head out
for a couple of hours.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.675
You get some good rest.

31:24.842 --> 31:27.303
Should be back before midnight
or after midnight.

31:27.469 --> 31:29.430

really wants to come in,

It stopped you.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.783
I didn't really
want to come in.

33:12.950 --> 33:14.660
Mommy's on the phone.

33:14.827 --> 33:17.454
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

33:17.621 --> 33:19.790
Hello.

Everything's fine, Maggie.
Nobody's hurt.

33:26.922 --> 33:29.925
I told them I was going out,
but they were sleeping.

33:30.092 --> 33:33.178
What am I to do? Wake them
every time I decide to go out?

33:33.345 --> 33:35.222
She's going to know
he's doing a bad job.

33:35.389 --> 33:37.307
He's drunk.

33:37.474 --> 33:39.727
Do you think it's good
for Mommy to know that?

33:39.893 --> 33:43.397
She's coming home a week early.

33:45.357 --> 33:48.360
Yes, Maggie.

34:06.879 --> 34:09.297

34:17.347 --> 34:19.933

34:20.100 --> 34:21.935
Mommy's coming on Friday,

34:22.101 --> 34:24.396
so let's make the apartment
nice and clean.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.148
You have to
unpack the boxes.

34:26.315 --> 34:27.875
I'm just saying,
we should all pitch in.

34:27.983 --> 34:29.359
They're your boxes.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.027
We don't know
what to do with them.

34:31.195 --> 34:33.112
We don't ask you
to clean up our room.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.699
Fine. Fuck it. Forget it.
Have a nice fucking day!

34:38.827 --> 34:41.914

35:32.089 --> 35:34.675
- It's beautiful.
- We love it!

35:36.635 --> 35:38.762
Just don't look in there.

35:44.518 --> 35:46.061

- Yes.

37:33.001 --> 37:37.172
When you knew Daddy
at WGBH, was he the way he is now?

37:37.339 --> 37:40.759
He was funny, compassionate.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.804
He knew everything
about the outdoors.

37:46.723 --> 37:49.059
He had a job,
which was really good for him.

37:49.226 --> 37:52.062
He was a terrific
lighting designer.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.858
But in the end,
it was too much pressure.

37:57.025 --> 37:58.902
And I didn't know...

38:00.404 --> 38:02.906
I didn't know
about manic depression.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.368
Besides, it was the '60s.

nervous breakdowns.

38:08.829 --> 38:12.958

You're probably sorry
you married him.

38:16.336 --> 38:18.672
No.

38:18.839 --> 38:20.841
Never.

- What is wrong with that sponge?
- It smells!

40:16.248 --> 40:18.041
That's because someone left it
soaking in the dishwater.

40:18.208 --> 40:20.568

it needs to be rinsed and squeezed

I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

40:45.569 --> 40:47.446
Why are we yelling
and being so grumpy?

40:59.124 --> 41:01.626
So we... we lost some momentum,
but we'll get it back.

41:06.006 --> 41:07.966
I bought a new sponge.

41:09.217 --> 41:11.636
Faith and I thought of the perfect job
for Daddy.

41:11.803 --> 41:15.015
A crepe cart in Harvard Square.
Just like they have in Paris.

41:15.182 --> 41:17.225
- Mmm.
- You do make the best crepes.

41:17.392 --> 41:19.686
Yes, and I love
standing outside in January

41:19.853 --> 41:21.771
freezing my ass off for pennies.

41:21.938 --> 41:25.025
- I like chocolate and coconut.
- We have that.

41:25.192 --> 41:28.028
That's on our menu!

41:28.195 --> 41:30.614
And the building is packed
with single mothers,

41:30.780 --> 41:32.866
and they're always
checking in on each other

41:33.033 --> 41:34.910
or going out
and getting together for coffee,

41:35.076 --> 41:36.912
but do they ever ask me
how I'm doing?

41:37.078 --> 41:38.955
Do they ever
invite me to coffee?

41:39.122 --> 41:40.562
I'm pretty sure
they all got together

41:40.707 --> 41:42.501
for wine and cheese
two nights ago.

41:45.378 --> 41:46.922
- I'm sorry, honey.
- No.

41:47.088 --> 41:49.341
- I shouldn't laugh at this.
- What? It is. It's...

41:49.508 --> 41:51.843
- No. It's funny.
- It is funny. It's hilarious.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.512
I'm pathetic.
I'm a pathetic whiner.

41:53.678 --> 41:55.305
No, you're not.

41:55.472 --> 41:57.390
Which is probably why
they don't invite me. Literally.

41:57.557 --> 41:59.309
- They run away from me.
- No. Listen to me.

41:59.476 --> 42:00.852
They're leery of men.
That's all.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.604
Especially married men
with children.

42:02.771 --> 42:05.565
Oh. I'm not exactly married.

42:05.732 --> 42:07.651
Am I?

42:08.818 --> 42:10.779
We're a family, aren't we?

42:12.739 --> 42:14.324
- Maggie...
- What?

42:14.491 --> 42:16.451
Is this really
how we're gonna do it?

42:16.618 --> 42:18.411
You're gonna
come home every weekend

42:18.578 --> 42:20.956
and then take up residence
on the sofa?

42:22.499 --> 42:24.251
For now.

42:24.417 --> 42:26.336
- Maggie...
- What?

42:26.503 --> 42:30.131
We haven't slept together
since before my breakdown.

42:30.298 --> 42:32.717
I'm dying!

42:32.884 --> 42:35.720
You're dying too.
You just don't realise it.

42:35.887 --> 42:38.014
- Cam, I just...
- Maggie...

42:38.181 --> 42:42.143
Oh... Can we... Can we please
just get through this phase?

42:42.310 --> 42:44.396
Just let's just get through
this phase,

42:44.563 --> 42:46.439
and then we'll see
how it goes.

42:46.606 --> 42:48.166
- And then what happens?
- I don't know.

42:48.316 --> 42:50.151
What's the end?
You move back in here...

42:50.318 --> 42:52.118
- I don't know.
- And then what happens to us?

42:52.237 --> 42:53.780
- I don't know!
- Where do I go?

42:53.947 --> 42:55.657
No. I don't know.

42:55.824 --> 42:57.659
All I know
is that it's gonna take

42:57.826 --> 43:01.538
steady, sustained effort.

43:01.705 --> 43:04.958
Yes. Sexy, sexy answer.

43:07.419 --> 43:10.171
It's an honest, honest answer.

43:11.965 --> 43:14.259
So, what's this?
Some big test? I mean...

43:14.426 --> 43:17.971
No. Don't look at it that way.
You hate tests.

43:18.138 --> 43:20.932
Not if this is
what's on the test.

43:37.324 --> 43:39.326
Coolant's a little low.

43:46.416 --> 43:48.585
Uneven wear on the tyres.

43:52.339 --> 43:53.882
Lock sticks.

43:56.051 --> 43:59.387
- There's no floor!
- But it's got a great engine.

44:00.764 --> 44:02.204
There's, uh...
there's no floor here.

44:02.349 --> 44:04.267
And... and the roof
is rotted out.

44:04.434 --> 44:07.228
I have two small children.
It's dangerous.

44:07.395 --> 44:10.357
What do you say
we close at 300 cash?

44:11.608 --> 44:13.151
You deal with the wagon.

44:22.744 --> 44:24.496
Daddy, Amelia's crying.

44:24.663 --> 44:27.207
- You always cry.
- Not anymore.

44:27.374 --> 44:30.085
- I vowed never to cry again.
- What's wrong, darling?

44:30.251 --> 44:35.674
What's gonna happen to the wagon?
Nobody's gonna want it.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.842
I thought you were crying
because this car sucks.

44:38.009 --> 44:40.136
That car sucked too.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.360
Remember to speak up, girls.

45:37.527 --> 45:39.571
Your great-grandmother
was born in 1888.

45:42.282 --> 45:46.745
I propose a game of Crazy Eights
after lunch.

45:46.911 --> 45:49.914
- Yeah!
- We don't say 'yeah', dear.

45:50.081 --> 45:52.083
- We say 'yes'.
- Thank you, Gaga.

45:52.250 --> 45:54.461
That's a battle
their mother keeps fighting.

45:54.627 --> 45:57.088
- And how is their mother?
- She's very well.

45:57.255 --> 45:58.895
She comes every weekend,
but this weekend,

45:59.007 --> 46:02.510
she stayed in the city
to study for her exams.

46:02.677 --> 46:05.513
But we're muddling through.
Aren't we, girls? Hm.

46:05.680 --> 46:08.349
A.J., will you please tell Betty
that the roast is divine?

46:08.516 --> 46:10.018
Yes, sir.

46:10.185 --> 46:12.604
Do you girls find it unusual

46:12.771 --> 46:14.731
that your mother
is in New York?

46:14.898 --> 46:16.733
She wants to have
more career opportunities.

46:16.900 --> 46:19.068
Mommy says
women can do anything.

46:19.235 --> 46:21.863
She's quite a striver,
isn't she?

46:22.030 --> 46:24.032
We prefer the word 'fighter'.

46:27.494 --> 46:29.871
I'm going
to go work on the car.

46:30.038 --> 46:32.332
The girls tell me
it has no floor.

46:32.499 --> 46:34.334
It had no floor.

46:34.501 --> 46:36.141
I scavenged these
from your kitchen vault.

46:36.252 --> 46:38.087
Betty said I could have them.

46:38.254 --> 46:40.965
- Cookie sheets?
- You still can't step on them.

46:41.132 --> 46:43.885
But they'll certainly keep out
the cold and detritus.

46:44.052 --> 46:46.721
Cam, I'm so proud of you

46:46.888 --> 46:50.141
for taking care of these
darling girls all by yourself.

46:50.308 --> 46:51.976
Thank you, Gaga.

46:52.143 --> 46:54.938
I'm mostly using the Lincoln
these days.

46:55.104 --> 46:57.649
I want you
to have the Bentley.

46:57.816 --> 47:00.360
- The Bentley?
- Mmm.

47:02.445 --> 47:04.447
There are trays
where we could eat.

47:04.614 --> 47:06.491
Could we eat dinner
in the car?

47:08.243 --> 47:12.038
All the windows work.
There's a floor!

47:12.205 --> 47:15.500
It smells so good.

47:15.667 --> 47:17.544
Gaga, we live in
a rent-controlled apartment.

47:17.710 --> 47:20.255
I know that.
I pay your rent.

47:20.421 --> 47:24.342
- And we're very grateful for it.
- It's dirt-cheap.

47:24.509 --> 47:27.470
But the point is I can't even
afford to maintain the Bentley.

47:27.637 --> 47:29.973
I can't even afford
to fill its gas tank.

47:30.139 --> 47:32.350
If you're asking me
for gas money...

47:32.517 --> 47:35.478
No, Gaga,
I'm not asking for gas money.

47:37.647 --> 47:41.442
The girls are both
phenomenal students.

47:41.609 --> 47:44.863
And they're not being challenged
where they are right now.

47:45.029 --> 47:47.198
And if you really
wanted to help,

47:47.365 --> 47:50.243
they would flourish
in a private school.

47:51.619 --> 47:55.957
I don't think that's teaching
the girls a very good lesson.

47:56.124 --> 47:57.834
Do you?

48:03.172 --> 48:05.008
No, I suppose not.

48:15.852 --> 48:18.229
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't take the Bentley.

48:18.396 --> 48:21.316
It didn't make any sense.
I know you're disappointed.

48:21.482 --> 48:23.860
You should have taken it
and sold it

48:24.027 --> 48:26.696
and then bought a crepe cart
and made lots of money

48:26.863 --> 48:28.573
and then we wouldn't
be so poor.

48:28.740 --> 48:30.617
Sweetheart,
although crepes are delicious,

48:30.783 --> 48:32.744
they're not exactly the goldmine
that you think they are,

48:32.911 --> 48:34.287
especially during a recession.

48:34.454 --> 48:37.624
Well, then, we could have
sold the Bentley

48:37.790 --> 48:39.459
and just had some money.

48:39.626 --> 48:41.377
Gaga would have never let me
sell that car.

48:41.544 --> 48:43.880
- She was giving it to you.
- It doesn't work like that.

48:44.047 --> 48:46.215
It's hard to explain.

48:46.382 --> 48:48.134
It was our one chance
to have something

48:48.301 --> 48:50.178
that other people might want.

48:50.345 --> 48:52.055
Nobody wants what we have.

48:59.020 --> 49:00.730
Daddy did something
so amazing.

49:00.897 --> 49:02.607
He did?

49:02.774 --> 49:04.534
Guess what I paid
for this parking spot.

49:04.692 --> 49:06.986
- Oh, God!
- Absolutely nothing.

49:07.153 --> 49:10.239
Well...
You get what you pay for.

49:10.406 --> 49:12.075
We have a surprise for you.

49:12.241 --> 49:14.577
- OK.
- That's Jock! That's our dog!

49:14.744 --> 49:17.025
- Daddy got him for us!
- Amelia named him!

49:20.708 --> 49:23.086
OK. Why... why
is he acting this way?

49:23.252 --> 49:25.046
He was abused
by his last owner.

49:25.213 --> 49:27.423
So any time Daddy leaves him,
he gets really upset.

49:27.590 --> 49:29.592
Because he loves Daddy.
'Cause Daddy saved him.

49:29.759 --> 49:31.886
We're working on it.

49:33.346 --> 49:34.973
And this is the new car?

49:35.139 --> 49:36.891
It was abused
by its last owner.

49:37.058 --> 49:39.852
But Daddy saved it.

49:40.019 --> 49:41.646
- Who's a good boy?
- Jock!

49:41.813 --> 49:43.439
- Jock, no!
- Wait!

49:43.606 --> 49:45.942
- Wait! Girls!
- Jock! Jock!

49:46.109 --> 49:48.277
- Jock! Come back!
- No!

49:48.444 --> 49:49.988
Don't eat that!

49:56.327 --> 49:59.330
- That's it, Little! Whoa!
- Whoa!

49:59.497 --> 50:01.040
Get up!

50:03.376 --> 50:05.753
Get in there!
Get in there like you mean it!

50:07.880 --> 50:09.424
Ah!

50:09.590 --> 50:11.050
Yes!

50:11.217 --> 50:13.302
Hey.

50:13.469 --> 50:15.429
Don't those two little girls
live in our building?

50:15.555 --> 50:17.390
Yeah, but they're really mean.

50:17.557 --> 50:20.393
Mean? They're wearing
matching pink pompom hats.

50:20.560 --> 50:22.353
How mean can they be?

50:22.520 --> 50:24.480
Hey! Little girls!

50:24.647 --> 50:26.482
Little boy!

50:26.649 --> 50:28.818
Come.
Come play basketball with us.

50:28.985 --> 50:30.862
- Are they mean?
- Mm-hm.

50:48.129 --> 50:49.630
That's it, Amelia.
Put pressure on him.

50:49.797 --> 50:51.674
Get your hands in there!

50:57.305 --> 51:00.183
Hands up, Amelia! Hands up!

51:02.894 --> 51:04.437
Alright, good job.

51:04.604 --> 51:06.397
Oh, yes!

51:09.484 --> 51:12.278
Those kids seem nice.
We should invite them over sometime.

51:12.445 --> 51:14.072
No way!

51:14.238 --> 51:16.365
I'd rather die than have people
into our shithole.

51:17.909 --> 51:19.452
They crush my soul.

Jock, go back. Go back!

- We don't have a babysitter.
- You don't need a babysitter.

52:30.857 --> 52:33.609
But it's night-time.
We get scared. Faithie gets scared.

52:33.776 --> 52:36.362
Then you need to toughen up.
What is there to be scared of?

52:36.529 --> 52:38.531
- Wolves? Vampires?
- Rapists!

52:38.698 --> 52:41.576
Rapists? If a rapist knocks,
don't let him in!

52:41.742 --> 52:44.453
But what if they force their way in?
That's what rapists do!

52:44.620 --> 52:48.416
You kick them in the balls! Oh!
I need to get out of here!

52:48.583 --> 52:51.627
I can't take it anymore!
I need to go be with adults!

52:51.794 --> 52:54.589
Not a bunch
of bratty, bossy brats!

52:54.755 --> 52:56.924
Unhand my foot!

53:13.566 --> 53:15.234
Oh!

53:34.629 --> 53:37.798
Oh. Hi, Cam. Going up?

53:40.051 --> 53:41.594
I guess so.

53:45.723 --> 53:47.767
- You need help folding those?
- You know...

53:47.934 --> 53:50.686
Actually, I forgot something
in the laundry room.

54:16.045 --> 54:18.256
See, girls?
The chain's worthless.

54:18.422 --> 54:21.592
All it does is provide
a false sense of security.

54:21.759 --> 54:25.263
And that's the last thing you girls need.
Sorry I scared you.

54:25.429 --> 54:28.724
We'll be braver, Daddy.
Next time, I promise we'll be braver.

54:33.312 --> 54:35.940
Put yourselves to bed.
I've got a mess to clean up.

54:39.610 --> 54:41.821
That lock was bullshit.

56:24.882 --> 56:27.218
- What happened to the Valiant?
- I didn't I tell you?

56:27.385 --> 56:30.179
- It caught on fire.
- Oh.

56:50.783 --> 56:52.543
- I'm depressed.
- Of course you are.

56:52.618 --> 56:54.995
Your dog ran away,
your family gives you

56:55.162 --> 56:57.498
just barely enough money to live off,
and you annoy people.

56:57.665 --> 56:59.375
You're leaving out
my haemorrhoids.

56:59.542 --> 57:01.210
Where are you going?

57:01.377 --> 57:02.837
I'm meeting
Kim, Ali and Thurgood.

57:03.003 --> 57:04.380
- Can I come?
- I guess.

57:04.547 --> 57:05.548
Can I come?

57:05.714 --> 57:07.091
- No!
- God!

57:07.258 --> 57:08.843
We are hanging out
with our friends!

57:09.009 --> 57:10.689
Why don't you ever
bring your friends here?

57:10.761 --> 57:13.055
- To this shithole?
- Stop saying that!

57:13.222 --> 57:15.102
Daddy, you can't hang out with kids.
It's weird.

57:15.141 --> 57:17.643
We need to have our own life,
and you need to have yours.

57:17.810 --> 57:19.562
How am I supposed to
have my own life

57:19.728 --> 57:21.439
when you won't let me
do anything?

57:34.535 --> 57:37.079
Fine! We're hanging out
at the picnic tables.

57:41.500 --> 57:44.587
- The death card.
- Does that mean I'm gonna die?

57:44.753 --> 57:46.672
Well, we all die sometime.

57:46.839 --> 57:48.382
Let's start over.

57:49.717 --> 57:52.553
Oh. Any of you kids
have a light?

57:54.346 --> 57:56.182
Can we finish this
at your apartment?

57:56.348 --> 57:58.726
Our parents
just got a new sectional.

57:58.893 --> 58:01.061
- Never mind. Here's one.
- How about you?

58:01.228 --> 58:02.813
My brother
is studying for law school.

58:02.980 --> 58:04.982
You're all welcome
to come to our apartment.

58:06.358 --> 58:09.069
Cam, can we speak to you
for a minute?

58:10.571 --> 58:12.114
What? What?

58:14.408 --> 58:16.243
I am about to
lose my shit.

58:16.410 --> 58:18.913
We told you you could
come hang out with us.

58:19.079 --> 58:21.279
We did not say you could
invite people to the apartment.

58:21.415 --> 58:23.042
- But it could be fun.
- Not fun. Humiliating.

58:23.209 --> 58:25.336
- Do we need to spell it out?
- I can make tea.

58:25.503 --> 58:27.713
We can have cinnamon toast.
There's lots of board games.

58:27.880 --> 58:29.673
We don't want people
to see how we live!

58:29.840 --> 58:32.259
Big deal how you live!
It's not your fault!

58:32.426 --> 58:35.971
Tell them - your father's
manic depressive or bipolar!

58:36.138 --> 58:37.932
Or whatever
they're calling it these days!

58:38.098 --> 58:39.808
Don't not have friends
because of me!

58:39.975 --> 58:42.269
Fuck it. Forget it.
Never mind.

58:55.866 --> 58:58.410
I'm warning you.
You've never seen anything like this.

58:58.577 --> 59:01.956
- I've seen messy houses before.
- Not like this.

59:04.500 --> 59:06.335
I'll run and close Daddy's door.

59:13.592 --> 59:15.970
We brought some friends over.

59:18.180 --> 59:19.265
Really?

59:33.529 --> 59:36.031
Why do you have so much stuff?

59:36.198 --> 59:40.995
- Our dad is totally polar bear.
- Bipolar. He's manic depressive.

59:41.161 --> 59:43.747
I have an uncle
with that. He also lives like a pig.

59:43.914 --> 59:45.499
Hey! That's cool.

59:55.217 --> 59:57.428
No more bets.

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:07.479
- Cinnamon toast and tea?
- Yes, please!

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:11.400
Mmm. Mmm, mmm.

01:00:11.567 --> 01:00:14.612
- Mmm.
- 32.

01:00:17.406 --> 01:00:18.782
Would anyone
like to learn

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.868
how to make chocolate truffles
from scratch?

01:00:21.035 --> 01:00:22.953
Me!

01:01:12.086 --> 01:01:13.671
Balls!

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.881
Yah!

01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:32.940
You know, you and Daddy
could go out sometime.

01:01:33.107 --> 01:01:35.275
We don't need a babysitter.
We used to get scared.

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:37.319
But we're not scared anymore.

01:01:37.486 --> 01:01:40.364
You've gotten so old.

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:44.076
I don't think I'm black.

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:48.622
- Of course you're black.
- But I look white.

01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:50.499
You're black, sweetie.

01:01:50.666 --> 01:01:52.459
Faith looks black.
I look like Daddy.

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:54.753
That's because
you're a mix of both of us.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.423
Nobody thinks I'm black
when I tell them.

01:01:57.589 --> 01:02:00.008
Amelia, you're black.

01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:04.596
Your mother is black.
So you're black.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:07.933
If it makes you feel better,
I'll tell people I'm black.

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.686
Even if they think
I'm delusional.

01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:14.273
That's ridiculous.
Of course she's black.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.234
Her mother's black.
She's being feisty.

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:21.739
- The girls seem good, right?
- No kidding.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:24.658
Last week, Amelia kicked
the crap out of the school bully.

01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:27.911
She kicked him so hard in the knee,
she put him on crutches.

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:30.414
- Wow!
- I was quite proud.

01:02:30.581 --> 01:02:31.957
Oh!

01:02:32.124 --> 01:02:33.792
You seem good.

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:36.712
So do you, Maggie.
Well, what do you know?

01:02:36.879 --> 01:02:39.548
I'll be better when I get a job
and I come back here.

01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:43.594
Thank you. Thank you so much
for making this possible.

01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:45.304
Stop sleeping on the sofa

01:02:45.471 --> 01:02:47.264
and spend the night
with me in a bed.

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:50.058
No. I can't
go in your room, Cam.

01:02:50.225 --> 01:02:54.313
- Why not?
- Oh! It's beyond belief. You...

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.982
Cam, you have three bicycles
in there.

01:02:59.735 --> 01:03:02.362
- That's your reason?
- Yes!

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:05.199
You have cans of paint thinner.

01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:08.118
Last time I went in there,
I came out and I had motor oil

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:09.787
all over my pants.

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:11.330
- Cam, it's ridiculous.
- Then I'll clean it!

01:03:11.497 --> 01:03:13.165
That would be really nice.

01:03:13.332 --> 01:03:14.708
It might make it
more inviting.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:16.835
You never said anything
about this to me before.

01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:19.242
I'm done nagging you about your room.
You're a grown man.

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:21.215
And you don't find my room
inviting?

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:23.467
No!

01:03:23.634 --> 01:03:25.719
Not me or anyone else.

01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:28.347
- I'm pretty sure not even you.
- Oh, definitely not me.

01:03:28.514 --> 01:03:30.516
That's it. I'll clean it.
Two days tops.

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:32.518
You'll see.
It'll be a thing of beauty.

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:34.561
- OK. We'll see.
- And till then?

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:36.104
What?

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:37.689
There's
a semi-private stairwell.

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:40.275
What do you say?

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:43.153
Oh. My stairwell days are over.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.240
You had stairwell days?

01:03:49.827 --> 01:03:53.455
Maggie Stuart?

01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:59.878
I'm about to finish my MBA
at Columbia Business School,

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:01.685
so I come to you
with wonderful references

01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:04.007
from Professor Wilson,

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:08.470
and I've been offered a futures job
at E.F. Hutton, in New York,

01:04:08.637 --> 01:04:11.640
but Howard and Company
is where I want to be.

01:04:11.807 --> 01:04:13.559
- E.F. Hutton?
- Yes.

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:15.936
Well, that's terrific.
Why come back to Boston?

01:04:16.103 --> 01:04:17.980
My children are here.

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:21.024
Children. Boys?

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:24.069
- Girls?
- Uh, two girls. Two girls.

01:04:24.236 --> 01:04:27.239
But they're very independent,
which...

01:04:27.406 --> 01:04:30.075
...gives me the ability
to work late

01:04:30.242 --> 01:04:32.244
and arrive very, very early...

01:04:32.411 --> 01:04:34.329
Well, thanks so much.
We'll be in touch.

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:37.374
Ah.

01:04:41.253 --> 01:04:43.171
Yes. Yes.

01:04:43.338 --> 01:04:45.799
Thank you so much
for your time. Thank you.

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:56.977
Daddy, do I add more butter
for each omelette?

01:04:57.144 --> 01:04:59.313
Half a tablespoon
for each omelette.

01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:01.273
Don't be afraid
to let it turn nut-brown.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.774
Got it!

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:05.944
Did you start my costume?

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:07.821
What costume?

01:05:07.988 --> 01:05:09.656
My flamenco dancer costume
for the talent show.

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:12.200
- You're making me a skirt.
- Right.

01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:15.162
- Daddy, it's tomorrow.
- Right, right. I know.

01:05:15.329 --> 01:05:16.914
I knew it!
You're not making it!

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.291
OK, OK! I said I'd make it,
and I will!

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:21.293
I want it to be
all sparkly and ruffly.

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.253
You got it, buggins.

01:05:28.759 --> 01:05:30.552
No big deal.

01:05:30.719 --> 01:05:33.513
I just need to make this skirt
200 times bigger.

01:06:12.803 --> 01:06:14.805
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:06:14.972 --> 01:06:17.391
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no! Goddamnit!

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:19.768
Goddamnit! Ah, shit!

01:06:19.935 --> 01:06:21.395
No! God...

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:22.896
Fuck it! Fuck!

01:06:23.063 --> 01:06:24.898
FUCK you!

Cam. Honey,
it's 5:00 in the morning.

01:07:08.817 --> 01:07:11.528
I just made your daughter
the most incredible skirt.

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:15.657
- Sparkles, ruffles. Beautiful.
- That's terrific.

01:07:15.824 --> 01:07:17.617
But you probably
should get some sleep.

01:07:17.784 --> 01:07:19.453
But I'm not tired, darling.

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:21.747
Cam?

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:24.624
Maggie, name one other father
in America who's up right now

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:27.127
sewing a flamenco skirt
for their daughter.

01:07:27.294 --> 01:07:29.463
Are you taking your lithium?

01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:36.595
Actually, I haven't
taken my lithium since you left.

01:07:36.762 --> 01:07:41.224
I find that if I take small,
steady sips of beer all day,

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.435
I stay on an even keel.

01:07:43.602 --> 01:07:46.438
Ahh!

01:07:46.605 --> 01:07:48.982
Hello?

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:53.111
Well? Well?
What do you think?

01:07:53.278 --> 01:07:56.156
It's the most glorious skirt
I've ever known.

01:07:56.323 --> 01:08:01.161
Ah! There you go. You look like
a... a flamenco mermaid.

01:08:03.914 --> 01:08:06.875
I love you, Daddy.

01:08:14.216 --> 01:08:16.009
Hi.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:31.358
- Listen to me.
- What?

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.777
It's just not healthy.

01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:36.822
You promised you would
take your lithium, Cam.

01:08:36.988 --> 01:08:38.740
Yes, and you promised
that you'd love me forever.

01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:40.742
- Better or for worse.
- Excuse me, sir.

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:44.830
But our dress code requires
that you wear a tie.

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:53.505
I'd like to say one thing about lithium,
if you don't mind.

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:55.173
Nobody even knows
if it works

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.300
or what the long-term effects
are on one's body.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:00.636
The same goes for Haldol,
Thorazine and valproic acid

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:03.265
and all the rest
of their so-called treatments.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:05.725
I am nothing more
than a guinea pig.

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:07.935
And you would have never known
I'd stopped taking it

01:09:08.103 --> 01:09:10.272
if I hadn't...
if I hadn't told you.

01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:13.108
I'm an idiot. A fucking
self-destructive fuckhead.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:14.651
- You're not.
- Thank you.

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:18.529
This is the reason why you have to
take responsibility for your condition.

01:09:18.697 --> 01:09:21.825
The way you've taken responsibility
for your children?

01:09:23.285 --> 01:09:25.078
That is not fair.

01:09:25.245 --> 01:09:27.455
I know. I know. I know.

01:09:28.707 --> 01:09:31.292
I know how hard it is for you
to come home every weekend.

01:09:31.459 --> 01:09:34.796
- I know. I know.
- It's not hard to come.

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:36.381
It's hard to leave.

01:09:36.548 --> 01:09:38.550
It's hard to leave
and have everybody look at me

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:40.716
like I'm the worst mother
in the world just because

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:42.845
I'm looking for a better life
for my children.

01:09:43.013 --> 01:09:45.390
Cam, you come from
a blue-blood family.

01:09:45.557 --> 01:09:47.725
When white people
live in squalor, they're...

01:09:47.893 --> 01:09:50.187
You're eccentric.

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:52.647
When black people live in squalor,
no-one's charmed.

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:54.566
Believe me.

01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:58.695
Well, if it's any consolation,

01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:02.407
no-one seems to be charmed by
my squalor either.

01:10:04.034 --> 01:10:07.787
I haven't made any headway
on my bedroom.

01:10:17.422 --> 01:10:20.550
I've decided I'm gonna take
the E.F. Hutton job.

01:10:22.344 --> 01:10:23.720
In New York.

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:26.556
Maggie, I can't keep doing this
on my own!

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:29.226
- They need you. I need you.
- I'm not asking... I know.

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:32.729
I'm not asking you to.
It's time for me to take the girls.

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:35.523
You're taking the girls
to New York?

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:37.067
- Yes.
- What about you and me?

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:39.110
What about us?

01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:41.112
What? No.

01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:43.490
I knew it! I knew it!

01:10:43.657 --> 01:10:45.784
There's so many things about you
that I still love.

01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:47.577
Can I have a Scotch and soda,
please?

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:49.162
Cameron.

01:10:49.329 --> 01:10:51.122
Listen to me.

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:53.416
I still believe in you.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:56.461
And I don't want to give up.
I don't.

01:10:57.629 --> 01:10:59.005
- But I can't.
- What?

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:01.341
Did you even... did you even...

01:11:01.508 --> 01:11:04.094
I mean, did you even try finding a job
when you were here?

01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:06.179
Or was that all
just part of your plan?

01:11:06.346 --> 01:11:09.683
My plan was I would... I would
come back right after school,

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:14.271
get a job, and maybe we'd stay together
and maybe we wouldn't,

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:18.191
but we would still be a family
and raise the girls together.

01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:21.403
But I can't get a job here.
I can't.

01:11:21.569 --> 01:11:22.988
These Boston firms
don't want me.

01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:26.241
- Why? Why don't they want you?
- It's Boston.

01:11:26.408 --> 01:11:28.868
They want people like you.

01:11:30.537 --> 01:11:33.999
You want a job in Boston?
I'll get you a job in Boston.

01:11:37.377 --> 01:11:40.255
You look well, Cam.
Everything good down your way?

01:11:40.422 --> 01:11:43.425
- No. Not really, Dickie. No.
- Sorry to hear that.

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:45.760
You know that Maggie's
just gotten her MBA?

01:11:45.927 --> 01:11:48.138
I heard. Good for her.

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:50.705
I was just wondering why there
isn't a position here for her.

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:52.767
It is a family firm,
after all.

01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:55.020
Cam, I wish there were
a place here.

01:11:55.186 --> 01:11:57.186
But we just don't have
that position at the moment.

01:11:57.314 --> 01:12:00.692
So you're telling me that when
Dickie Jr and the other one...

01:12:00.859 --> 01:12:02.902
...graduate from college...
- Sumner. That's my other son.

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:05.488
They're not gonna land here?
Goddamnit, Dickie!

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:08.491
I know how this works.
You create the position!

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:10.285
I have to say, Cam,
this is why

01:12:10.452 --> 01:12:12.287
we never invite you
to the Christmas party.

01:12:12.454 --> 01:12:15.123
I don't give a shit
about the Christmas party!

01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:16.791
I want you
to hire my wife!

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:19.002
She works 50,000 times harder
than any of you!

01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:21.338
I'm sorry. I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:23.423
No! Do you have any idea
how hard it is?

01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:25.800
Do you have any idea
the sacrifice she makes?

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:28.595
She needs a job here in Boston!

01:12:28.762 --> 01:12:30.805
- Goddamnit!
- Control yourself!

01:12:30.972 --> 01:12:32.640
Goddamnit!

01:12:33.725 --> 01:12:35.477
Stop it! Snap out of it!

01:12:46.321 --> 01:12:48.031
Cam?

01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:54.287
Cameron?

01:12:54.454 --> 01:12:56.623
Cam?

01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:05.173
Why are you wet?

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:07.008
The girls asleep?

01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:10.887
Yes, they are.

01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:14.057
Did Faith show you her skirt?

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:17.519
She did.

01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:19.521
It's beautiful.

01:13:22.774 --> 01:13:25.485
I couldn't get you a job
in Boston.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.615
It's alright.

01:13:40.208 --> 01:13:42.919
I jumped in the Charles River.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:01.646
I'm just gonna miss them.

01:14:03.815 --> 01:14:05.859
I know.

01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:25.879
New York is really dangerous!
Where are we going to live?

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:28.256
I'll find us
a very safe neighbourhood.

01:14:28.423 --> 01:14:31.176
- Where will we go to school?
- I'm gonna work on that.

01:14:31.342 --> 01:14:33.344
We can't ride bikes
in New York.

01:14:33.511 --> 01:14:36.264
You'll be able to ride your bike
when you come up here and visit.

01:14:36.431 --> 01:14:38.433
What about Daddy?
Who's going to take care of him?

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.280
Honey, your daddy
can take care of himself.

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:43.605
Yeah - I'll go to movies and...

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:45.190
...dinner parties.

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:46.774
I'll have escapades.

01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:48.902
I think escapades
are an extremely bad idea.

01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:50.612
If we're not here,
he'll drink too much

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:52.197
and stop
taking care of himself.

01:14:52.363 --> 01:14:53.865
That's not true.

01:14:54.032 --> 01:14:55.408
He'll be lonely without us.

01:14:55.575 --> 01:14:57.160
- Well, that is true.
- Girls.

01:14:57.327 --> 01:14:58.870
Taking care of you alone

01:14:59.037 --> 01:15:00.622
put a lot of pressure
on your father.

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:03.028
- How? We get to school.
- He drives us anywhere we want.

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:05.418
I have seen more R-rated movies
than any of my friends.

01:15:05.585 --> 01:15:08.505
He got me the original cast soundtrack
of 'Anything Goes'.

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:10.882
He needs a break.
Your father needs a break.

01:15:11.049 --> 01:15:13.843
When I had the flu, he cut up
strawberries and kiwis for me.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:16.221
And he arranged them on a plate
like little flowers.

01:15:16.387 --> 01:15:19.349
I did do that. I did that.

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:24.729
Girls, you'll be able
to come and visit Daddy,

01:15:24.896 --> 01:15:26.648
and Daddy
will come and visit you.

01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:29.400
New York is an incredible city.

01:15:29.567 --> 01:15:31.361
You're gonna like it.

01:15:31.528 --> 01:15:33.488
I promise.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:33.006
Can't visit you in New York.
Too much speed and noise and...

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:35.967
All the people in the streets
all night. Uh...

01:16:36.134 --> 01:16:37.677
Knocks me off track.

01:16:37.844 --> 01:16:39.887
I was thinking about that.

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:46.144
I really do understand why...

01:16:46.311 --> 01:16:48.111
...why you don't want to
live with me anymore.

01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:51.190
I'm a much better father
than I was a husband.

01:16:52.317 --> 01:16:54.694
You know what
Faithie told me last night?

01:16:54.861 --> 01:16:56.237
What?

01:16:56.404 --> 01:16:58.364
"The thing about Daddy

01:16:58.531 --> 01:17:00.867
"is that he's always around.

01:17:01.034 --> 01:17:02.952
"He's always there."

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:05.830
I thought that irritated them.

01:17:10.001 --> 01:17:11.711
I have a plan.

01:17:13.921 --> 01:17:16.341
I take the job
and I earn money.

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:21.387
The girls stay here with you,
and they can ride their bikes

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:24.057
and play with their friends.

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:28.561
But we have to put them
in a good private school,

01:17:28.728 --> 01:17:31.272
where they can be challenged.

01:17:31.439 --> 01:17:33.733
I insist on it.

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:38.738
Are you sure, Maggie?

01:17:54.671 --> 01:17:56.839
Just, if I take them to New York,
they're gonna be

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:59.217
locked up like house pets
in some dark apartment,

01:17:59.384 --> 01:18:02.679
and I won't be home until 8:00 at night,
every night.

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:05.931
And I... I don't want that
for them.

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:14.691
They're my babies.

01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:31.708
I know. Our babies.

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:49.434
Alright, Amelia.
Go to goal. Go to goal.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.936
Nice shot, Amelia!

01:18:52.103 --> 01:18:54.480
OK, go for goal.
OK, now shoot!

01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:58.443
Nice shot, Amelia's friend!

01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:00.987
How come your dad
always comes to practice?

01:19:01.154 --> 01:19:03.531
- He's got nothing else to do.
- Hmm.

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:20.506
Daddy, Annie invited me for a sleepover.
Can I go? Please?

01:19:20.673 --> 01:19:22.884
And Fifi asked me
to go with her to the movies.

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:25.511
But I finally convinced Eliot Perkins
to let us use his boat.

01:19:25.678 --> 01:19:28.055
I thought we could have
a picnic on the river.

01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:29.974
It's too late
to go out on a boat.

01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:32.185
- It's 4:00.
- I really want to go to Annie's.

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:34.312
Maybe Annie wants to
take a ride down the river.

01:19:34.479 --> 01:19:36.397
- Daddy.
- Serious. She lives in Boston.

01:19:36.564 --> 01:19:39.275
How many times has she
gotten a ride home on a boat?

01:19:39.442 --> 01:19:41.152
- She takes the T.
- What about Fifi?

01:19:41.319 --> 01:19:43.738
Think she'd like to have
a nice picnic on a boat?

01:19:43.905 --> 01:19:46.324
Her mom's picking her up in 20 minutes.
Please can I go?

01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:48.534
You'll never find
a more beautiful boat

01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:51.037
on a more perfect day
to be out on the river!

01:19:53.247 --> 01:19:57.043
Well, I guess I'll just tell
the Charles River to go fuck itself.

01:19:57.210 --> 01:19:59.712
Well, I have heard
the Charles River's a real asshole.

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:06.469
- ' Bye, Daddy.
- ' Bye, Daddy.

01:20:06.636 --> 01:20:09.138
- We love you.
- OK.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:11.015
'Bye.

01:20:11.182 --> 01:20:14.477
My darlings,
I'm so proud of you.

01:20:14.644 --> 01:20:16.187
- So is Mommy.
- Why?

01:20:16.354 --> 01:20:18.731
- We just are.
- 'Bye!

01:20:18.898 --> 01:20:20.858
I love you!

01:20:25.196 --> 01:20:27.156
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:29.242
- Watch us walk away.
- I was just watching you walk.

01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:31.285
- Please don't.
- Why?

01:20:31.452 --> 01:20:33.788
- You make us feel bad.
- I don't want you to feel bad.

01:20:33.955 --> 01:20:36.958
Yes, you do! That's why you
stand there looking pathetic!

01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:39.484
I was watching you walk across
the field, for Christ's sake!

01:20:39.585 --> 01:20:41.921
- It's allowed!
- Daddy.

01:20:42.088 --> 01:20:44.507
We are walking away now.

01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:48.427
And we are not turning around.
We are not looking back.

01:20:48.594 --> 01:20:50.805
- I'm not asking you to.
- Love you, Daddy.

01:20:50.972 --> 01:20:52.807
- Goodbye.
- We love you. Goodbye.

01:21:06.654 --> 01:21:10.283
- Don't cry. Don't cry.
- I can't help it.
