WEBVTT

01:04.023 --> 01:05.108
Hey, Jimenez...

01:05.191 --> 01:08.278
Do you think
the Special Forces guys killed him?

01:08.361 --> 01:10.321
If he can even be killed, that is.

01:15.577 --> 01:17.996
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

01:18.663 --> 01:20.290
I don't know.

01:20.373 --> 01:22.834
I heard they shot him 20 times.

01:23.501 --> 01:25.712
They pumped him full of lead.

01:25.795 --> 01:29.132
Then they burned his body
and spread his ashes all over Medellín.

01:30.717 --> 01:35.054
They say that he rose from the ashes,

01:35.138 --> 01:38.266
and he went to the houses
of each of the men who had shot him,

01:38.349 --> 01:40.226
and he killed them as they slept.

01:41.227 --> 01:42.520
Bullshit.

01:42.604 --> 01:44.481
Quiet! Someone's coming.

01:45.774 --> 01:47.942
We're soldiers from the National Army!

01:48.026 --> 01:50.278
Stop and identify yourselves!

01:51.029 --> 01:52.697
We're well armed!

02:09.005 --> 02:10.548
Mr. Escobar.

02:11.382 --> 02:14.344
I'm sorry, but we've been ordered
to not let you through.

02:14.427 --> 02:16.846
We have to take you into custody.

02:27.065 --> 02:28.942
Son, I'm sorry to say...

02:31.069 --> 02:34.197
unfortunately,
I can't allow that to happen.

02:43.122 --> 02:44.541
Excuse me.

02:58.471 --> 03:01.182
You don't speak a word of this to anyone,
understood?

06:33.186 --> 06:34.687
This...

06:35.563 --> 06:37.923
is an enormous embarrassment
for all of Colombia, gentlemen.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.487
So...

06:44.030 --> 06:46.407
- how will we proceed?
- Mr. President...

06:49.410 --> 06:54.791
Mr. President, Escobar will surely attempt
to reestablish himself within the city,

06:54.874 --> 06:58.461
and we can't allow him and his <i>sicarios</i>
to move freely.

06:58.544 --> 07:02.006
So my recommendation, Mr. President,
is that we occupy Medellín.

07:02.090 --> 07:05.760
Flood the streets with officers.
Conduct searches.

07:05.843 --> 07:09.555
Close down the streets.
Establish vehicle checkpoints.

07:09.639 --> 07:11.399
Pressure him until he appears,
Mr. President.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.476
And who would conduct such an operation?

07:13.559 --> 07:15.603
Colonel Pinzón, sir.

07:18.147 --> 07:20.608
- He should begin immediately.
- Of course, Mr. President.

07:24.112 --> 07:27.532
<i>- Are you injured?</i>
- No, I'm not hurt.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.075
<i>You know I couldn't talk to him.</i>

07:30.034 --> 07:31.661
I couldn't negotiate with Escobar.

07:34.038 --> 07:36.582
- I understand.
- Why did you go inside?

07:36.666 --> 07:38.709
<i>I sensed something was off.</i>

07:38.793 --> 07:42.588
Ariza said his orders were
to secure the perimeter, that's all.

07:42.672 --> 07:44.882
<i>Well, he lied. I gave the order myself.</i>

07:45.675 --> 07:48.594
<i>Go home and get some rest,
but come back soon.</i>

07:48.678 --> 07:51.889
You know you're the only person
I can trust.

07:52.974 --> 07:54.100
Yes, sir.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.736
It's all right, Tata. I'll be right back.
Excuse me, Doña Hermilda.

08:08.823 --> 08:09.949
Boss.

08:11.868 --> 08:14.096
- It's good to see you.
- It's great to have you back home.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.705
Very good to see you.

08:15.788 --> 08:17.915
He's here. It's him.

08:17.999 --> 08:21.752
- Praise the Lord. I knew it. I knew it.
- How are you, brother?

08:23.171 --> 08:24.171
Pablo!

08:29.093 --> 08:31.012
Thank God.

08:32.763 --> 08:34.557
- Oh, my son!
- How are you?

08:34.640 --> 08:35.993
- I'm all right.
- You're all right?

08:36.017 --> 08:37.393
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

08:37.476 --> 08:39.061
- You're all right?
- I'm all right.

08:46.527 --> 08:49.405
- I did everything I could, Dad.
- I know.

08:50.156 --> 08:51.741
I know.

08:51.824 --> 08:53.784
I am very proud.

08:55.161 --> 08:56.871
I love you very much.

09:06.923 --> 09:08.132
It's Dad.

09:11.469 --> 09:15.598
...you and your family. May he always
protect you in his holy glory.

09:15.681 --> 09:17.183
Thank you very much.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.310
You're great boys.

09:24.523 --> 09:28.027
- Monitor the police frequencies.
- Yes.

09:28.110 --> 09:31.322
And don't bother me unless it's necessary.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.032
As you wish, boss.

09:33.991 --> 09:35.701
Very good.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.413
Very good, gentlemen.

09:40.206 --> 09:41.666
Very good.

09:53.135 --> 09:55.775
Please take the things out of the car
and organize them over there.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.613
I felt I'd lost you.

10:14.490 --> 10:16.617
You're never going to lose me.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.956
And what now, Pablo?

10:22.039 --> 10:23.833
What will we do now?

10:24.959 --> 10:29.630
I did what I had to do, Tata.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.801
I'll take care of it.

10:35.636 --> 10:40.141
We'll be fine, and content,

10:40.224 --> 10:44.186
and happy, and together, and united.

10:44.270 --> 10:45.479
But--

10:46.564 --> 10:47.898
Always.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.076
Always.

11:00.745 --> 11:03.664
- Tell me you'll never leave me.
- Never.

11:05.583 --> 11:07.001
Promise.

11:10.463 --> 11:12.089
I promise.

11:14.842 --> 11:17.053
I promise, my love.

12:23.285 --> 12:27.039
Yes, I understand you're from the DEA,
but I have to ask Colonel Pinzón first.

12:27.123 --> 12:28.165
Wait one moment.

12:39.593 --> 12:42.346
Gentlemen, wait here for a moment.

12:42.430 --> 12:45.433
We'll let you in once the area is secured,
understood?

12:48.727 --> 12:51.397
We're going to have to move everything.

12:52.231 --> 12:55.526
- What do you mean by "everything"?
- Everything. The labs...

12:56.444 --> 13:02.741
the offices, the hideouts, the deposits...
we're moving everything.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.827
Boss, even the labs?

13:05.661 --> 13:07.788
They're well-guarded. There's no problem.

13:07.872 --> 13:12.042
Come on, don't you know
what's going on at La Catedral?

13:12.126 --> 13:16.714
The cops are going through all of the maps
and documents you idiots left behind.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.924
Now we can't trust anyone, you bastards.

13:19.008 --> 13:20.968
Who are you calling a bastard,
you son of a bitch?

13:21.010 --> 13:24.972
We're... moving... everything.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.434
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.144
Yes, Don Pablo.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.605
We're also going to need more men.

13:33.564 --> 13:36.025
Last night we lost a lot of brothers.

13:37.359 --> 13:40.154
- May they rest in peace.
- Amen.

13:44.450 --> 13:45.743
And one last thing.

13:46.535 --> 13:50.998
I'm going to need a good driver with a
clean record to drive me around the city.

13:51.081 --> 13:56.795
He needs to be smart, fearless, and loyal.

13:57.755 --> 13:59.048
- Done, boss.
- Boss, I'm sorry,

13:59.131 --> 14:03.636
but you can't risk yourself like that.

14:03.719 --> 14:06.180
Yes, Don Pablo, I agree with Velasco.

14:07.181 --> 14:11.727
I want people to know that Pablo Escobar
doesn't hide like a rat.

14:15.064 --> 14:16.815
Because we...

14:17.983 --> 14:22.404
are the Medellín cartel, motherfucker!

14:59.942 --> 15:00.985
Pablo, no!

15:04.405 --> 15:08.200
You believe whatever the fuck you
want to believe, you son of a bitch!

16:15.726 --> 16:20.814
- This again? Stop obsessing. Relax.
- Relax? What do you want me to do?

16:20.898 --> 16:23.942
Should I sit here and wait for Pablo
to walk through that door

16:24.026 --> 16:27.154
and kill me and my daughter?
He's going to come and kill you, too.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.799
- What do you think about that?
- Pablo won't be killing anyone, all right?

16:29.823 --> 16:31.784
Jaime, what country do you live in?

16:32.910 --> 16:35.746
If he hasn't killed anyone yet,
he's planning on it.

16:36.455 --> 16:41.251
Haven't you noticed, Berna?
Judy, haven't you noticed?

16:41.335 --> 16:43.879
Gaviria's got this city
swarming with cops.

16:43.962 --> 16:46.882
There's a cop
on every fucking street corner.

16:47.758 --> 16:49.927
Pablo can't move.

16:50.010 --> 16:53.931
Then we have to find and kill the bastard
before the police find him.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.516
Judy, listen.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.602
Listen to me! Listen!

16:58.686 --> 17:03.107
Pablo, right now, it's like
he's like a caged rat. Understand?

17:03.190 --> 17:04.733
Jaime.

17:05.818 --> 17:09.405
Despite everything, you still don't know
what Pablo's capable of?

17:09.488 --> 17:13.409
- He's someone we can't underestimate.
- You said it, Berna.

17:13.492 --> 17:16.412
They shouldn't underestimate us either.

17:16.495 --> 17:18.664
And Pablo's got very few friends left,
and you know it.

17:18.747 --> 17:21.375
Pablo will always have friends.

17:21.458 --> 17:25.796
Berna, I want everyone to know
what happened to Kiko.

17:27.131 --> 17:32.261
It should be clear
that being loyal to Escobar

17:32.344 --> 17:34.513
will only earn you a bullet in the head.

17:34.596 --> 17:38.809
They'll know what side
they should be on, right?

17:38.892 --> 17:40.185
Judy...

17:42.438 --> 17:44.440
what do we do with the labs?

17:47.401 --> 17:48.861
What do you suggest?

17:51.196 --> 17:54.658
I think we shut down the labs,
at least for a while.

17:56.243 --> 18:00.998
We have to lay low
until Pablo is killed or captured.

18:01.081 --> 18:05.294
That's stupid, Berna.
Tell me how that makes any sense.

18:05.377 --> 18:09.089
A lot of other people also stopped
paying Pablo at the same time as us.

18:09.173 --> 18:11.258
Let's join forces with them.

18:11.341 --> 18:14.553
There's the Priscos, for example.
Last night I met with Ricardo.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.263
I'll talk to him.

18:16.346 --> 18:19.183
Jaime, be very careful with those people.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.106
- Hello?
- Okay?

18:26.190 --> 18:28.108
- That looks nice.
- One moment.

18:28.192 --> 18:29.401
Ricardo?

18:33.530 --> 18:34.740
Don Pablo.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.705
Of course. There was no decision to make.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.833
You know that you can always count on us.

18:56.345 --> 18:57.679
Sweetie!

19:00.265 --> 19:01.683
Hey!

19:01.767 --> 19:02.851
Fag!

19:02.935 --> 19:05.437
What's going on, Limón?

19:05.521 --> 19:08.690
- Son of a bitch.
- How's it going, brother? Good or what?

19:08.774 --> 19:13.695
Quica, my love, come give me
the best 20 minutes of my life.

19:13.779 --> 19:15.781
What are you doing here? Are you going in?

19:15.864 --> 19:17.991
No, brother.
I didn't come to see the whores.

19:18.075 --> 19:21.787
- Then what?
- I came to see you, brother.

19:23.163 --> 19:27.501
And from what I can see,
you're still driving whores everywhere.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.503
You know how it is. I have to pay rent.

19:30.337 --> 19:34.341
Listen, Limón,
don't you want to make good money?

19:35.300 --> 19:36.677
Doing what?

19:37.469 --> 19:40.848
- The same thing, brother.
- Driving who?

19:41.974 --> 19:43.767
Pablo Escobar, brother.

19:43.851 --> 19:48.856
- Eat shit, you son of a bitch.
- Limón, I'm serious, brother.

19:48.939 --> 19:52.985
The boss asked us to find someone...

19:53.527 --> 19:56.405
someone clean, who the police don't know.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.157
He would go in the trunk.

20:01.034 --> 20:05.581
- Where would I have to take him?
- Wherever he wants to go. You don't ask.

20:07.666 --> 20:09.418
What do you think, brother?

20:12.671 --> 20:13.881
There's cops everywhere.

20:13.964 --> 20:16.925
Why don't we put a girl in the back
so no one gets suspicious?

20:19.678 --> 20:22.931
- Which one of the whores do you trust?
- They're whores, brother.

20:23.015 --> 20:25.434
Then who, brother?

20:26.101 --> 20:27.978
- No!
- No?

20:29.396 --> 20:30.647
- Thank you.
- Why not, Maritza?

20:30.731 --> 20:32.983
- No.
- What's wrong with it? Nothing.

20:33.066 --> 20:36.403
- I'm very busy, Jhon.
- That doesn't matter, Maritza.

20:37.195 --> 20:38.280
Yes?

20:39.781 --> 20:41.783
Ask one of the girls
you drive around all day.

20:41.867 --> 20:43.660
- I can't.
- Get out of my way.

20:43.744 --> 20:47.539
Maritza... I need you to do it.

20:47.623 --> 20:50.584
It'll be the easiest money
you'll make in your life.

20:50.667 --> 20:53.462
You can quit your second job, understand?

20:53.545 --> 20:55.305
You'll be able to take care
of your daughter.

20:55.380 --> 20:59.801
Haven't I always done right by you? I've
always helped you and your family, right?

20:59.885 --> 21:03.805
So? Right?

21:06.642 --> 21:08.644
You're a son of a bitch, you know?

21:10.812 --> 21:12.064
So what?

21:32.626 --> 21:35.879
- And who's that?
- He's a friend. He's trustworthy.

21:35.963 --> 21:39.216
What's up, Quica?
This is the girl I told you about.

21:45.514 --> 21:46.807
Let's go.

21:47.516 --> 21:49.810
Take care, skinny!

21:52.229 --> 21:54.106
- All good?
- All good, brother.

21:54.189 --> 21:55.524
I'll follow you, brother.

21:56.274 --> 21:59.194
- Who's that bitch?
- Close your fucking legs, Rosa.

21:59.277 --> 22:01.029
You'll kill all the flowers.

22:01.113 --> 22:04.074
You shit-eating bastard.
This pussy smells great.

22:05.283 --> 22:08.036
Now you're going to the market
to buy your whores, you bastard?

22:08.120 --> 22:09.788
Don't get pissy.

22:09.871 --> 22:12.833
If you're in a better mood
when I come back this afternoon,

22:12.916 --> 22:14.501
you'll get to fuck me.

22:16.128 --> 22:18.296
Fucking Quica.

22:18.380 --> 22:21.383
Shut up! Go inside! Watch yourself!

24:15.288 --> 24:17.666
Ready? Close your eyes.

24:19.084 --> 24:20.084
That's right.

24:21.211 --> 24:24.881
It's a little bunny, my love.
She's very delicate.

24:28.218 --> 24:29.469
Boss?

24:46.820 --> 24:48.405
Look, Don Pablo...

24:49.114 --> 24:52.075
this is the guy
I've been telling you about, Limón.

24:52.159 --> 24:53.451
He's Guarazapo's cousin.

24:55.078 --> 24:59.583
Limón! Come here, brother. Come on!

25:06.047 --> 25:07.716
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

25:08.884 --> 25:11.678
Don't worry, boss.
We've known each other for a long time.

25:11.761 --> 25:14.890
Besides, he's never had any run-ins
with police. He's clean.

25:14.973 --> 25:16.683
And where are you from, son?

25:16.766 --> 25:19.352
I was born in Envigado, sir.

25:19.436 --> 25:21.396
My mother lives in the barrio
you built for us.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.400
I'm very glad.

25:26.443 --> 25:28.320
- What about the girl?
- She...

25:28.403 --> 25:30.155
She's a friend, boss.

25:31.072 --> 25:33.909
We went to school together in Envigado.
I know her very well

25:33.992 --> 25:37.913
and I know where she works,
so she's someone we can trust, boss.

25:40.207 --> 25:41.583
Listen, Limón...

25:45.587 --> 25:47.631
Do you know what it means to work for me?

25:47.714 --> 25:50.133
It's an honor to work for you, Don Pablo.

25:51.301 --> 25:54.054
You've done so much
for the poor in Medellín...

25:56.681 --> 25:58.767
if I have to lose my life for you...

26:00.393 --> 26:01.978
I will, boss.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.400
All right.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.323
Open the trunk.

27:49.753 --> 27:51.796
Don't worry, brother. Everything's good.

28:18.406 --> 28:19.616
All yours.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.089
Where are we?

28:39.219 --> 28:42.305
- What the fuck are we doing here, Jhon?
- Get down and hide.

28:42.389 --> 28:44.557
- Jhon, I don't--
- Shit, Maritza,

28:44.641 --> 28:48.353
I don't have time to give you
explanations. Just do it, all right?

29:20.385 --> 29:21.886
Don Pablo.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.430
- Hello.
- Welcome.

29:23.513 --> 29:26.641
Thank you. No, don't get up. Don't get up.

29:26.724 --> 29:28.768
- How are you?
- Very well.

29:28.852 --> 29:30.395
Great, I'm very glad.

29:32.313 --> 29:35.358
- Rojas.
- Don Pablo.

29:35.442 --> 29:36.818
- Sir.
- How have you been?

29:36.901 --> 29:38.462
Well, sir. How are you?
I wasn't expecting you.

29:38.486 --> 29:40.530
- I'm well. Very well.
- Guys, please.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.115
Yes, sir.

29:42.198 --> 29:44.200
- Don Pablo.
- Do you want anything to drink, sir?

29:44.284 --> 29:45.302
- A coffee?
- No, thank you.

29:45.326 --> 29:48.746
- Can I get you anything?
- Thank you, I'm fine.

29:50.999 --> 29:53.626
- How are you?
- I'm well, sir. Everything is well.

29:53.710 --> 29:56.796
- How is Maribel?
- Maribel is well, sir. Thank you.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.465
Good, brother.

29:58.548 --> 30:00.967
What's going on with the deposits?

30:02.010 --> 30:03.237
They're looking a little light.

30:03.261 --> 30:06.264
Well, after everything
that happened with...

30:07.390 --> 30:13.771
with Mr. Galeano and Mr. Moncada, well...
people are nervous, you understand?

30:13.855 --> 30:18.568
This woman, Judy Moncada,
has been talking to people.

30:19.694 --> 30:21.613
Not everyone wants to pay.

30:26.367 --> 30:29.329
- So that's it?
- That's it, sir. I thought you knew.

30:29.412 --> 30:33.416
- I told them to tell you--
- Calm down. Don't worry about that.

30:34.542 --> 30:37.670
We'll fix that problem soon.

30:37.754 --> 30:38.963
Yes, sir.

30:41.841 --> 30:43.343
In the meantime...

30:44.886 --> 30:47.972
I want you to move
to the offices in Laureles.

30:49.349 --> 30:51.476
It's no longer safe here.

30:51.559 --> 30:54.270
- Done, sir. Whatever you say.
- Good.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.689
And fill this up, please.

31:09.953 --> 31:11.162
Don Pablo!

31:11.663 --> 31:13.164
- Sir, how are--
- Is that you?

31:13.248 --> 31:15.375
- How are you, sir?
- Sweetie! Sweetie!

31:15.458 --> 31:18.836
Sweetie!
Don Pablo is in front of our house.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.296
Don Pablo?

31:20.380 --> 31:22.173
- Don Pablo!
- Hello Ma'am. How are you?

31:22.257 --> 31:23.675
- Fine, and you?
- I'm well.

31:23.758 --> 31:25.969
- It's him, old man.
- Sir, how are you?

31:26.052 --> 31:28.388
- How is your health?
- It's good. Very good!

31:28.471 --> 31:30.932
Good. Good. How are all of you?
Good? Good?

31:31.015 --> 31:32.600
- How are you, Don Pablo?
- Good.

31:32.684 --> 31:34.102
It's him.

31:34.185 --> 31:35.687
In the flesh?

31:35.770 --> 31:39.190
- Good?
- Boss, we should get going.

31:39.274 --> 31:41.985
Let them see me. Let them see me.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.945
I never thought I'd meet you in person.

31:44.028 --> 31:45.780
I'm well, Ma'am, how are you?

31:45.863 --> 31:50.243
- Here, boss, behind you.
- Here. Let's see.

31:50.326 --> 31:53.454
- Generous as always, Don Pablo.
- For you.

31:53.538 --> 31:56.499
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- For the doctor, sir. For the doctor.

31:56.583 --> 31:58.876
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- Take care of yourself.

32:00.753 --> 32:02.171
For you, Ma'am.

32:02.964 --> 32:04.048
For you too, sir.

32:39.375 --> 32:43.129
There's a girl on line three.
She wants to talk to an American.

32:55.725 --> 32:58.311
- What's wrong, brother?
- Suck my dick, please.

33:02.440 --> 33:05.777
- DEA Agent Peña.
<i>- Pay attention.</i>

33:06.444 --> 33:09.781
I know where you can find
one of Escobar's men.

33:10.907 --> 33:12.158
<i>Oh, yeah? Which one?</i>

33:13.242 --> 33:15.244
There's a reward, right?

33:16.037 --> 33:18.039
Yes, there's a reward.

33:18.122 --> 33:21.167
What's your information, miss?
Who are you talking about?

33:24.212 --> 33:25.588
La Quica.

33:28.466 --> 33:29.759
La Quica?

33:30.677 --> 33:32.929
You know La Quica?

33:33.012 --> 33:35.598
He came to the brothel on 23rd street.

33:35.682 --> 33:38.351
He left with a man in a taxi
and said he would return later.

33:39.477 --> 33:41.104
Do you work there?

33:44.691 --> 33:45.733
<i>Yes.</i>

33:46.651 --> 33:47.902
How long ago was this?

33:49.487 --> 33:51.489
A couple of hours ago.

33:51.572 --> 33:54.283
All right, we'll look into it.

34:39.746 --> 34:42.165
It would be worth investigating, Colonel.

34:43.166 --> 34:44.417
We're not asking for a lot.

35:01.476 --> 35:03.019
<i>Did you close the lab?</i>

35:03.102 --> 35:04.896
Jesus Christ.

35:04.979 --> 35:08.316
No, Berna, and I won't
because it's not necessary.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.987
- Listen to me, Jaime--
<i>- No, you listen to me. Enough of this.</i>

35:13.070 --> 35:15.364
I already spoke with
Ricardo Prisco, all right?

35:15.448 --> 35:17.867
He's with us. He supports us.

35:17.950 --> 35:20.470
Everything is firm. Everything is good.
What more could we want?

35:20.536 --> 35:23.790
I told you to be careful
with those people, Jaime.

35:23.873 --> 35:24.999
<i>Pay attention to me.</i>

35:25.082 --> 35:28.711
<i>First, these guys have been with us
since Pablo killed Kiko, right?</i>

35:28.795 --> 35:31.464
Second, Ricardo knows
that being loyal to Pablo

35:31.547 --> 35:33.174
means a bullet in the head, brother.

35:33.257 --> 35:37.595
And third, and to ease your mind,
they're sending us men, for security--

35:37.678 --> 35:38.971
What?

35:39.055 --> 35:42.308
So you gave these people
the address to the lab?

35:42.391 --> 35:45.186
<i>Don't be an idiot.
How else would they get here?</i>

35:46.187 --> 35:48.439
Jaime, listen to me.

35:48.523 --> 35:51.734
Get out of there now.
Get moving and come here right now!

35:51.818 --> 35:54.195
Listen to me, Berna!
Stop with the paranoia, brother!

35:55.822 --> 35:57.824
<i>Jaime! Jaime! Get out now!</i>

35:57.907 --> 35:59.826
- Come here now!
- Come play, motherfuckers!

36:01.702 --> 36:03.663
<i>Jaime! Jaime!</i>

36:03.746 --> 36:04.747
Get out now!

36:08.751 --> 36:11.504
What's going on, Ricardo?

36:13.589 --> 36:15.424
You're fucking up, man.

36:16.384 --> 36:18.594
Ricardo, put the gun down, brother.

36:19.804 --> 36:22.139
Ricardo, put it down.
Pablo is weak right now, brother.

36:22.223 --> 36:24.183
You know this.

36:24.267 --> 36:26.602
The city's filled with cops.

36:27.979 --> 36:29.981
Pablo can't move, brother.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.733
Ricardo, put the gun down.

36:39.532 --> 36:41.284
Hello, Jaime.

36:43.411 --> 36:44.620
Jaime.

36:44.704 --> 36:47.957
<i>- Berna, how have you been?</i>
- Who's this?

36:48.040 --> 36:52.920
This is Pablo speaking. I imagine
you want to talk to Jaime, right?

36:55.965 --> 36:57.508
Berna, help me, man.

36:57.592 --> 37:01.429
Berna, talk to Pablo.
Explain everything, Berna! Help me!

37:01.512 --> 37:02.889
Pablo, no! Wait!

37:10.479 --> 37:12.940
And now, you fat son of a bitch...

37:13.649 --> 37:18.487
we're coming after you
and that bitch you protect.

37:18.571 --> 37:21.824
Pablo, you've just made
the biggest mistake.

37:21.908 --> 37:23.618
<i>Tell the others...</i>

37:24.493 --> 37:25.493
Who is it?

37:26.203 --> 37:30.458
...that Pablo Escobar is to be respected,

37:30.541 --> 37:32.168
you son of a bitch.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.843
<i>That son of a bitch!
His entire family, do you understand?</i>

37:40.927 --> 37:44.013
I want everyone
in his fucking family dead!

37:44.096 --> 37:46.390
That fat fuck!

37:46.474 --> 37:49.352
Son of a bitch!

37:50.311 --> 37:51.812
Listen, Judy...

37:53.981 --> 37:57.485
I'm very sorry about Jaime, and I'm very
sorry about all of these deaths.

37:57.568 --> 38:01.113
We have to accept that we lost this time.

38:02.114 --> 38:05.952
But you know what?
I'll be with you until the end.

38:06.035 --> 38:10.247
And if you want to go ahead on
against Pablo, just say so.

38:10.331 --> 38:16.128
We'll find strong allies. And people.
We'll need a lot of people.

38:18.464 --> 38:19.548
Yes.

38:27.723 --> 38:28.975
You're right.

38:31.852 --> 38:33.062
Yes.

38:36.273 --> 38:39.318
I think we have to see things
for what they are.

38:39.402 --> 38:41.696
The truth of the matter, just as it is.

38:42.989 --> 38:45.199
And this is the truth, Berna:

38:47.368 --> 38:50.037
I know of someone who's very powerful.

38:51.831 --> 38:54.375
Someone who wants to kill Pablo
as much as I do.

39:10.599 --> 39:14.228
- You sure it's not a trap?
- I'm not sure of anything.

40:55.579 --> 40:56.789
Hello, Fernando.

41:00.626 --> 41:03.045
You did very well, sister.

41:04.130 --> 41:06.882
Look... you don't just get two,
you get three.

41:08.008 --> 41:14.431
You have a special talent, and that's why
you get three instead of two green ones.

41:19.937 --> 41:25.025
What are you doing tonight, sweetie?
I know of a nice calm place.

41:25.109 --> 41:27.486
We could have fun.

41:28.404 --> 41:31.907
I can't.
I have to take care of my daughter.

41:36.245 --> 41:39.123
- Bitch. Give me 30 minutes, Limón.
- All right, brother.

41:39.206 --> 41:41.125
I'm going to fuck one of them.

41:45.379 --> 41:46.630
Sweetie...

41:48.841 --> 41:50.217
Thank you, Maritza.

41:58.684 --> 42:00.186
Bastard.

42:27.046 --> 42:29.715
Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!

42:52.238 --> 42:55.950
Right here, to the right.
It's the next right.

42:56.033 --> 42:58.452
Know the area well, don't you, Peña?

42:58.535 --> 43:00.412
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:05.287 --> 45:07.831
Yeah? You like that? Yeah?

45:10.876 --> 45:14.463
There's the taxi. Park on the left. There.

45:22.429 --> 45:24.306
Calm down! Calm down!

45:25.891 --> 45:27.643
Okay, let's go.

45:30.771 --> 45:32.272
All right. Wait for me here.

45:53.794 --> 45:56.213
- Trujillo!
- Go around! Go around!

45:56.296 --> 45:57.965
Move! Move! Move!

45:58.882 --> 46:00.968
Move! Move! Move!

46:04.304 --> 46:05.431
Brother!

46:06.014 --> 46:07.516
God damn it. What?

46:07.599 --> 46:09.726
- Quica! Quica!
- What's the problem, brother?

46:09.810 --> 46:11.645
Let's go, brother. Hurry up!

46:18.277 --> 46:20.320
Brother! Hurry, Quica!

46:46.221 --> 46:48.390
They're cops, brother! Run!

47:39.149 --> 47:42.194
Stop looking.
This is the best place to eat.

47:56.250 --> 47:57.834
<i>The situation is that...</i>

47:58.752 --> 48:03.632
your escape has left us without...
We don't have a lot of options.

48:03.715 --> 48:06.510
If I hadn't escaped,
they would have killed me, Fernando.

48:08.178 --> 48:10.597
Or I'd rot in an American jail.

48:11.723 --> 48:17.563
- You will tell Gaviria--
- Gaviria is being crucified by the media.

48:18.772 --> 48:21.108
I don't think it's a good time.

48:23.318 --> 48:27.072
You will tell Gaviria...

48:32.661 --> 48:36.707
I am willing to go back to La Catedral
to finish my sentence.

48:36.790 --> 48:38.333
As you wish.

48:39.251 --> 48:42.421
- Tomorrow morning, I'll return to Bogotá.
- No, no, no, brother.

48:45.841 --> 48:52.556
We can't... leave for tomorrow
what we can do today.

48:52.639 --> 48:53.639
Right?

49:02.441 --> 49:05.360
Mr. President,
Mr. Fernando Duque is on the line.

49:08.322 --> 49:11.867
- I don't have anything to say to him.
- I'll handle it. You go ahead.

49:14.036 --> 49:16.913
Mr. Duque. Eduardo Sandoval speaking.

49:16.997 --> 49:21.043
Mr. Vice Minister, I have an important
message from Mr. Escobar.

49:22.502 --> 49:28.008
He says he's willing to negotiate the
conditions for his return to La Catedral.

49:30.761 --> 49:32.262
Turn on the television.

49:40.020 --> 49:43.231
- What did he say?
- He told us to turn on the television.

50:05.212 --> 50:07.255
<i>Good evening, compatriots.</i>

50:07.339 --> 50:13.762
<i>In the last year and a half, we've
enjoyed the peace we'd long awaited...</i>

50:13.845 --> 50:15.180
<i>for over a decade.</i>

50:16.848 --> 50:19.184
<i>Now we can go to work,</i>

50:19.267 --> 50:23.939
<i>drop our children off at school,
and enjoy life's small pleasures...</i>

50:25.065 --> 50:29.069
without the threat of violence
looming around every corner.

50:31.071 --> 50:34.157
This peace is now threatened
by virtue of Pablo Escobar's escape.

50:34.241 --> 50:40.372
Escobar has been named the bloodiest
narcoterrorist of all time.

50:42.499 --> 50:45.711
This history... changes today.

50:47.713 --> 50:49.756
<i>But I need your help.</i>

50:50.924 --> 50:54.803
<i>We must come together as a people,
as a country,</i>

50:54.886 --> 50:58.265
<i>so his reign of terror comes to an end
here and now.</i>

51:00.475 --> 51:02.978
<i>This is why I'm before you now...</i>

51:03.937 --> 51:08.734
<i>offering a reward of 1.4 million dollars</i>

51:08.817 --> 51:12.487
<i>for whoever gives information
leading to his capture.</i>

51:15.157 --> 51:18.285
<i>It is my hope that through this reward...</i>

51:19.619 --> 51:23.540
<i>the day will finally come when our country
is free of Pablo's grip...</i>

51:23.623 --> 51:29.337
<i>and will cease to be held hostage
by terror, intimidation...</i>

51:30.756 --> 51:32.299
<i>and murder.</i>

51:32.382 --> 51:34.718
I want to make it very clear...

51:35.761 --> 51:37.804
that under no circumstances...

51:39.181 --> 51:41.641
will I negotiate with Pablo Escobar.
