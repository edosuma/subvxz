00:00.400 --> 00:06.400
( Theme music playing )

00:07.219 --> 00:08.344
All right, I did it.

00:08.722 --> 00:11.100
I bought the costume.
What costume?

00:11.149 --> 00:12.182
The one my wife wanted.

00:12.217 --> 00:15.774
To jump start or reignite some flames?

00:15.774 --> 00:16.713
- Yeah.
- It's not...

00:16.713 --> 00:18.822
Mr. burns and smithers, is it?

00:18.857 --> 00:20.524
[Laughter]

00:20.558 --> 00:23.272
- No.
- Which one is it, then?

00:23.272 --> 00:24.061
I mean, if you
don't want to say...

00:24.095 --> 00:25.863
If it's too, you know,

00:25.897 --> 00:27.297
- personal...
- Uh...

00:27.332 --> 00:28.465
Han Solo and slave Leia.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.134
How does slave Leia costume fit ya?

00:30.168 --> 00:32.668
[Laughter]

00:32.704 --> 00:35.072
I just ordered it. It's not here yet.

00:35.106 --> 00:36.607
What about you guys?

00:36.641 --> 00:38.809
Me? I actually had a little theme going

00:38.843 --> 00:41.345
much like yours, except she was slave Leia,

00:41.379 --> 00:42.679
and I was Jabba.

00:42.714 --> 00:44.982
[Laughter]

00:45.016 --> 00:46.617
Because I'm more realistic
than this guy, right?

00:46.651 --> 00:49.920
Or he could have special-ordered
Uncle Owen and aunt Beru.

00:49.954 --> 00:52.055
[Laughter]

00:58.396 --> 01:01.331

Hello, nd welcome back

01:26.558 --> 01:28.292
<i>to another episode
of comic book men...</i>

01:28.326 --> 01:29.827
The only show that can't wait to see

01:29.861 --> 01:32.095
a Clint Barton, Katniss Everdeen,

01:32.130 --> 01:35.265
and Oliver Queen all-arrow orgy.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.167
I'm your host Kevin Smith.

01:37.202 --> 01:38.836
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:38.870 --> 01:40.592
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming chen.

01:40.592 --> 01:41.826
All right, gentlemen, what is going on

01:41.860 --> 01:43.828
in the world of freaks and geeks?

01:48.600 --> 01:52.603
Hey, man, when did this
picture get added to the wall?

01:52.637 --> 01:54.138
I think Mike put it up there. Wasn't me.

01:54.172 --> 01:55.940
- Do you know who that is?
- No. Who is that?

01:55.974 --> 01:57.308
It's triplicate lass.

01:57.342 --> 01:59.143
She can split herself

01:59.177 --> 02:00.945
into three exact versions of herself.

02:00.979 --> 02:03.948
But my real question is,
could you handle that?

02:03.982 --> 02:05.649
Three at one time?

02:05.684 --> 02:07.251
Yeah. I think I could handle three.

02:07.285 --> 02:09.053
You are so full of yourself, man.

02:09.086 --> 02:12.590
I don't think any of us, at
this stage of our lives...

02:12.624 --> 02:13.891
I think I could handle three,

02:13.925 --> 02:16.894
especially now... I'm
feeling strong now.

02:16.928 --> 02:19.563
- "Especially now."
- Why now?

02:19.598 --> 02:22.066
I don't know... lately I've been
feeling real good about myself.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.968
'Cause he's all charged
up from the last two years

02:24.002 --> 02:26.103
of his one wife giving him none.

02:26.138 --> 02:28.205
[Laughter]

02:28.240 --> 02:30.241
- How you doing?
- Hi. How's it going?

02:30.275 --> 02:32.276
- What can we do for you today?
- Well...

02:32.310 --> 02:35.479
I'm looking for the first
appearance of hobgoblin.

02:35.514 --> 02:37.381
<i>That's amazing Spider-Man 238.</i>

02:43.822 --> 02:45.756
We do happen to have the book.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.425
You want to run up there
and grab it for her?

02:47.459 --> 02:50.879
- No problem.
- So what... you're interested

02:50.879 --> 02:52.885
in picking it up.
Yeah. I'm interested

02:52.885 --> 02:54.368
to start my own comic-book collection,

02:54.556 --> 02:56.938
so I thought, "hey, let's
start with first appearances."

02:57.222 --> 02:58.518
Okay. Why hobgoblin?

02:58.832 --> 02:59.570
He does have a following,

02:59.604 --> 03:01.372
but I never understood what it was.

03:01.406 --> 03:03.674
He's just a second-rate green goblin.

03:03.708 --> 03:05.776
The poor man's green
goblin is what you call it.

03:05.811 --> 03:07.978
[Laughter]

03:08.013 --> 03:09.914
You know, I think he's a
little bit more contemporary

03:09.948 --> 03:10.915
than green goblin.

03:10.949 --> 03:12.917
I grew up with the cartoon,

03:12.951 --> 03:15.586
and he was kind of a mean
feature in the cartoon.

03:15.620 --> 03:18.055
I remember when the
hobgoblin issue came,

03:18.090 --> 03:20.591
'cause it was like, "a brand-new goblin!

03:20.747 --> 03:21.776
He's gonna be...

03:21.776 --> 03:23.294
"He's like the green goblin but metal!"

03:23.328 --> 03:25.262
[Laughter] "He's gonna be amazing!"

03:25.296 --> 03:27.464
I could tell from
that level of excitement,

03:27.482 --> 03:29.600
you didn't consider the hobgoblin

03:29.634 --> 03:31.602
just a second-rate green goblin?

03:31.636 --> 03:33.904
The idea of, like...
Norman osborn had passed on

03:33.939 --> 03:35.506
in this run of the comics.

03:35.540 --> 03:37.224
The idea of bringing back a goblin

03:37.275 --> 03:38.909
and then just
changing it up...

03:38.944 --> 03:41.512
I was like, this book should have

03:41.546 --> 03:43.514
goblins on every page, man!

03:43.548 --> 03:46.584
I want green, hob, knob.

03:46.618 --> 03:49.420
I want lots of goblins in this book, man.

03:49.454 --> 03:51.956
<i>Not only does amazing Spider-Man 238</i>

03:51.990 --> 03:53.958
have the first appearance of the hobgoblin,

03:53.992 --> 03:55.793
but there was a special insert put in there

03:56.504 --> 03:58.672
called "tattooz," with a "z,"

03:58.706 --> 04:00.941
that makes the book, with the tattooz,

04:00.975 --> 04:02.342
really valuable.
That's great.

04:02.377 --> 04:04.211
Without the tattooz,
a little less valuable.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.380
Should I wrap it up?

04:06.414 --> 04:08.115
I mean, it's got everything
you're looking for...

04:08.149 --> 04:10.584
Nice condition, fair price.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.452
All right, um...

04:12.487 --> 04:15.422
Can I take a look at it for a second?

04:15.456 --> 04:18.492
$94 is a little bit steep.

04:18.526 --> 04:19.660
What about $60?

04:19.694 --> 04:22.930
$60 without the
tattooz... maybe.

04:22.964 --> 04:24.598
$60 with the
tattooz... never.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.900
The absolute best I
could do with the tattooz

04:26.935 --> 04:28.869
would be $75.
All right, well...

04:28.903 --> 04:31.772
What if we offered you
something else in exchange

04:31.806 --> 04:33.874
to bring the price down a little bit more?

04:33.908 --> 04:35.309
A little trade? What do you got?

04:35.343 --> 04:36.810
All right.

04:40.148 --> 04:41.215
Ooh, what's this?

04:41.249 --> 04:43.150
We have some sealed Batman boxes.

04:43.184 --> 04:45.219
- Boxes?
- Unopened.

04:45.253 --> 04:46.954
- What's inside them?
- I don't know.

04:46.988 --> 04:49.990
It could be anything.
Where'd you get these?

04:50.024 --> 04:53.427
At a convention on
Chicago in the early 2000s.

04:53.461 --> 04:57.264
They were just giving them
away at, like, a roulette wheel.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.199
These boxes...
They're a mystery.

04:59.234 --> 05:00.367
Could be worth hundreds.

05:00.385 --> 05:02.669
Could be worth a dollar. We don't know.

05:02.704 --> 05:05.305
You were like Brad pitt.
You're like, "what's in the box?

05:05.340 --> 05:07.374
Oh, what's in the box?"

05:07.408 --> 05:08.942
So you want to put these

05:08.977 --> 05:10.811
to get the book down to what, then?

05:10.845 --> 05:12.679
- For the $60.
- Yeah...

05:12.714 --> 05:14.615
That's a gamble on my part, then.

05:14.649 --> 05:17.084
$60 cash and two mystery boxes.

05:17.118 --> 05:18.585
What do you think?

05:18.620 --> 05:21.488
I think it might be worth
the price just to see it.

05:23.458 --> 05:26.526
All right will do 60 for the book.

05:26.561 --> 05:27.895
All right, great.

05:27.929 --> 05:29.897
You guys want to
see what was inside...

05:29.931 --> 05:33.834
What you guys gave up for only 30 buck

05:33.868 --> 05:35.202
oh...

05:35.236 --> 05:37.304
All right, Batman logo...

05:37.338 --> 05:39.039
- Batman logo.
- It's good, it's good.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.409
It's in there tight, man.

05:45.313 --> 05:46.980
Eh...
Who is it?

05:47.015 --> 05:48.682
I don't even
know. It's like, uh...

05:48.716 --> 05:51.218
This must be, like,
a Batman, like, variant?

05:51.252 --> 05:53.020
All right, well...

05:53.054 --> 05:54.955
- This one's got to be better!
- This one's got to be the one.

05:54.989 --> 05:57.224
This one's got to be worth 30 bucks.

05:57.258 --> 05:58.592
- Easy.
- You know what, man?

05:58.626 --> 06:00.661
I'm getting too nervous.
I want you to open it

06:00.695 --> 06:02.696
and just tell me what it is.
All right.

06:05.166 --> 06:07.334
Yeah, you hold one
end... there you go.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.469
No, no... come on, don't rip...

06:09.504 --> 06:11.338
Don't destroy the box!
Forget it, man!

06:11.372 --> 06:13.273
Here we go.

06:13.308 --> 06:16.176
Yeah!

06:16.210 --> 06:18.378
- No?
- Ugh. What?

06:18.413 --> 06:20.280
It's not even Batman!

06:20.315 --> 06:22.683
What is this... Catwoman?
It's Catwoman

06:22.717 --> 06:25.919
with giant mouse ears.
Yeah, that deal's off.

06:25.954 --> 06:28.288
[Laughter]
I'm sorry. Here you go.

06:28.323 --> 06:31.725
All right, guys. Well, I mean...

06:31.759 --> 06:34.695
It looks like at least one
of us made out on the deal.

06:34.729 --> 06:36.163
Yeah. It was us. [Chuckles]

06:36.197 --> 06:39.333
- You think?
- Losing your touch.

06:39.367 --> 06:41.468
Have a great day.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.971
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

06:44.005 --> 06:46.573
This is the first
Nintendo system ever out.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.609
They go from $3,000.
These go for $3,000?

06:55.023 --> 06:56.757
Why is it they can never build a jail

06:56.792 --> 06:58.726
strong enough to hold the supervillains?

06:58.760 --> 07:00.400
It seems like they're always getting out.

07:00.428 --> 07:01.595
Because they got to get out,

07:01.629 --> 07:03.797
or else there'd be no monthly adventures

07:03.831 --> 07:05.165
of your favorite superheroes,

07:05.199 --> 07:06.456
or else they'd just be sitting around

07:06.476 --> 07:07.843
because joker's still in jail.

07:07.877 --> 07:09.511
What a great issue that would be!

07:09.546 --> 07:10.813
I realize that,

07:10.847 --> 07:12.815
but why can't he fortify Arkham, you know,

07:12.849 --> 07:14.450
maybe come up with some kind of technology?

07:14.484 --> 07:16.051
Let's frickin' keep him in there.

07:16.086 --> 07:17.319
I think what you're saying

07:17.354 --> 07:18.654
is, like, they got to
learn from their mistakes.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.122
How many times does the joker get away

07:20.156 --> 07:22.925
before they're like, "oh, we
got to try something different"?

07:22.959 --> 07:24.593
Why don't they just execute him?

07:24.627 --> 07:26.095
'Cause of this, my friends.

07:26.129 --> 07:27.763
This is why your favorite supervillains

07:27.797 --> 07:31.400
consistently break out
of jail month after month.

07:31.434 --> 07:32.901
6 bucks.

07:32.936 --> 07:34.770
[Laughter]

07:34.804 --> 07:36.672
That's all I had.

07:43.747 --> 07:45.581
Excellent choice. Thank you.

07:45.615 --> 07:48.283
- Thanks very much.
- All right.

07:48.318 --> 07:49.551
- Hello.
- How you doing?

07:49.586 --> 07:51.453
Do you guys happen to
buy vintage video games?

07:51.488 --> 07:53.022
Not really, no.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.958
Well, perhaps I'll show you this anyway.

07:55.992 --> 07:59.294
This is the first
Nintendo systems ever out.

07:59.329 --> 08:00.496
This is the game and watch, right?

08:00.530 --> 08:02.464
- You got it.
- Remember these?

08:02.499 --> 08:03.499
Now, these are cool.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.430
You'll see all the foundations

08:11.430 --> 08:14.099
of the first Nintendo entertainment system

08:14.133 --> 08:16.167
and the DS and the Game Boy

08:16.202 --> 08:18.336
in these games.
Is Nintendo still in business?

08:18.822 --> 08:19.621
I think so.

08:19.708 --> 08:20.775
- Are they really?
- Yeah.

08:20.810 --> 08:22.410
You never heard of the Wii, perhaps?

08:22.444 --> 08:24.712
- It's a growing industry, this video
- game thing.

08:24.747 --> 08:26.648
[Laughter]

08:26.682 --> 08:28.583
Mm...

08:28.617 --> 08:29.884
Look at the graphics.

08:29.919 --> 08:31.452
It's barely a graphic.

08:31.487 --> 08:33.321
It's just like a square.

08:33.355 --> 08:34.556
But back then, that's all you had.

08:34.590 --> 08:36.624
So why are you trying to sell 'em today?

08:36.659 --> 08:38.726
I have my first child on its way.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.361
- Congratulations.
- Why, thank you.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.431
I figure some of my toys
would go to pay for his.

08:43.465 --> 08:44.766
Even his crappiest toys

08:44.800 --> 08:46.267
will be more advanced than this stuff.

08:46.302 --> 08:48.770
Yeah, right?

08:48.804 --> 08:50.772
It was almost like a museum piece to me.

08:50.806 --> 08:52.640
And, you know, as an avid gamer myself...

08:52.675 --> 08:54.976
<i>Would you be that excited
to see someone bring in pong?</i>

08:55.010 --> 08:57.178
I actually would have
been excited to see some guy

08:57.213 --> 08:59.948
<i>bring in pong.
It doesn't take much.</i>

08:59.982 --> 09:01.833
It was just a piece of gaming history.

09:01.884 --> 09:03.484
<i>You could play, like, donkey Kong on it.</i>

09:03.502 --> 09:05.153
<i>Donkey Kong introduces Mario.</i>

09:05.187 --> 09:07.989
Mario is still alive and vital today

09:08.023 --> 09:10.625
within the multi-billion dollar
gaming industry.

09:10.659 --> 09:12.110
<i>If you think about it,
remember how the Simpsons</i>

09:12.144 --> 09:13.995
<i>started on the Tracey Ullman Show,</i>

09:14.029 --> 09:15.096
but nobody remembers that part?

09:15.130 --> 09:16.431
<i>Donkey Kong's kind of like</i>

09:16.465 --> 09:18.433
<i>the Tracey Ullman of video games.</i>

09:18.467 --> 09:19.834
[Laughter]

09:19.869 --> 09:22.971
<i>So what are you looking
to get for donkey Kong ii?</i>

09:23.005 --> 09:25.306
- I'm looking for 200 each.
- For an old game?

09:25.341 --> 09:27.075
This is a piece of gaming history, man.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.244
<i>This is like
The Hulk 181 of...</i>

09:29.278 --> 09:31.079
<i>Bullcrap, The Hulk 181!</i>

09:31.113 --> 09:32.380
- It is, right?
- Absolutely.

09:32.414 --> 09:34.315
<i>This is The Hulk 181 of video games,</i>

09:34.350 --> 09:36.284
handheld video games?
Yes.

09:36.318 --> 09:37.619
So, if we could sell it for $200,

09:37.653 --> 09:38.820
what do you think is a fair offer?

09:38.854 --> 09:40.455
I would say 100 bucks.

09:40.489 --> 09:42.090
- No way.
- No? You wouldn't pay $100?

09:42.124 --> 09:43.558
I'm not paying triple figures.

09:43.592 --> 09:45.727
You don't have to worry.
I won't sell it for $100.

09:45.761 --> 09:47.128
- Really?
- Yeah, these things...

09:47.162 --> 09:50.064
They have value, and
they go for a lot of money

09:50.099 --> 09:51.966
on the net.
Why'd you bring them in here?

09:52.001 --> 09:54.369
You can just go right to your precious net.

09:54.403 --> 09:57.405
I thought the secret stash,
you know, was, you know...

09:57.439 --> 09:59.774
Prided itself on rare items.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.175
Yeah, you thought, you know,

10:01.210 --> 10:04.212
maybe the people who worked here
were a little more open-minded.

10:04.246 --> 10:05.546
- It's not about open
- minded.

10:05.581 --> 10:07.348
It's about we don't have enough cash

10:07.383 --> 10:10.385
to buy every piece of merchandise

10:10.419 --> 10:12.353
that comes through the door.
No, I understand that,

10:12.388 --> 10:13.988
but it's also like, "I never heard of this.

10:14.023 --> 10:15.757
I never saw this. This is worthless."

10:15.791 --> 10:17.358
<i>I've heard of donkey
Kong. I know what it's about.</i>

10:17.393 --> 10:19.694
Yeah, but you never
heard of the game and watch?

10:19.728 --> 10:21.429
They go from $3,000.

10:21.463 --> 10:24.165
- These go for $3,000?
- Absolutely.

10:24.199 --> 10:26.367
You can flip this.

10:26.402 --> 10:29.003
You know what?

10:29.038 --> 10:31.839
We're gonna have to decline
on... on the video game.

10:31.874 --> 10:33.875
It's just not something for the stash.

10:33.909 --> 10:35.977
Thanks for bringing it in,
man. I hope we didn't waste

10:36.011 --> 10:37.178
your time.
Not a problem.

10:37.212 --> 10:39.047
But thank you.

10:39.081 --> 10:40.615
I hate this.

10:40.649 --> 10:43.017
There's a walk of shame right here.

10:43.052 --> 10:44.519
- See you guys later.
- See you later.

10:44.553 --> 10:45.954
- Take care, guys.
- All right.

10:45.988 --> 10:46.988
What is with you, man?

10:47.022 --> 10:48.523
What do you mean what's with me?

10:48.557 --> 10:50.391
Those are cool items, man.

10:50.426 --> 10:52.293
You want to be like
a little super Mario?

10:52.328 --> 10:53.995
The toilet's been backed up for days.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.330
Give you a couple gold coins

10:55.364 --> 10:57.932
if you go in there and fix the toilet.

10:57.967 --> 10:59.534
[Laughter]

10:59.568 --> 11:01.769
Go get Mike, otherwise known as Luigi.

11:05.007 --> 11:06.541
It's a me, Mario.

11:10.479 --> 11:12.947
Name Dr. strange's manservant.

11:12.982 --> 11:14.248
It's on the tip of my tongue.

11:14.283 --> 11:16.317
Yeah, along with
this gum ball... suck it.

11:17.648 --> 11:19.599
I wanted an atari 2600,

11:19.634 --> 11:21.468
but my parents wouldn't go for it.

11:21.519 --> 11:23.537
They're too expensive.
Finally, I guess my father

11:23.571 --> 11:25.489
tracked one one in the want ads

11:25.523 --> 11:28.592
with 12 games, and it
was a reasonable price.

11:28.626 --> 11:31.228
So we go to this house to pick it up,

11:31.262 --> 11:34.381
and what it turns out is
the atari and the games

11:34.527 --> 11:38.346
were being sold as
punishment to another kid

11:38.381 --> 11:40.232
who didn't do well in school.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.750
And so the transaction
was in the living room

11:42.768 --> 11:44.386
with the kid looking on

11:44.388 --> 11:46.138
and with another parent saying to the kid,

11:46.138 --> 11:49.039
"see? If you had gotten as,
you would still have that."

11:49.074 --> 11:50.541
And it tainted the whole thing.

11:50.575 --> 11:51.876
Wow.

11:51.910 --> 11:53.244
- Wow.
- I mean, that's crazy.

11:53.278 --> 11:55.946
There's a chance that
that kid, now all grown up,

11:55.964 --> 11:58.249
could be watching this right now

11:58.283 --> 12:00.017
as you recount that tale...

12:00.051 --> 12:01.936
He's like, "your family outing

12:01.987 --> 12:03.287
was my family ending!"

12:03.321 --> 12:05.923
[Laughter]

12:17.823 --> 12:19.001
Kind of slow in here.

12:19.001 --> 12:20.435
Why don't we play a
little comic-book trivia?

12:20.469 --> 12:21.969
We'll sweeten the pot a little

12:22.004 --> 12:24.005
or make it a little bit more interesting

12:24.039 --> 12:25.239
with gum balls.

12:25.274 --> 12:27.308
All right, how? -
I ask you comic-book

12:27.310 --> 12:29.577
trivia questions. Get 'em wrong...

12:29.611 --> 12:31.679
Stuff a gum ball in those jaws.

12:31.713 --> 12:33.047
And you keep chewing gum balls

12:33.082 --> 12:34.282
for every wrong question you get.

12:34.316 --> 12:35.483
And the loser is the guy

12:35.517 --> 12:37.418
who, "a," I can't understand your answer,

12:37.453 --> 12:39.954
or "b," you tap out like wusses.

12:39.988 --> 12:42.190
And keep in mind... these gum
balls have been sitting here

12:42.224 --> 12:43.858
for at least five years,

12:43.892 --> 12:45.393
so they're nice and soft.

12:47.096 --> 12:49.297
All right, fire away with the questions.

12:49.331 --> 12:51.199
First question to Mike z.

12:51.233 --> 12:53.868
Superboy has been a member
of at least three super teams.

12:53.902 --> 12:55.636
Can you name them?

12:55.671 --> 12:57.872
The legion of
superheroes, the teen titans,

12:57.906 --> 13:00.074
and the ravers.
Correct.

13:00.109 --> 13:03.644
Name Dr. strange's manservant.

13:03.679 --> 13:05.046
Ooh...

13:05.080 --> 13:06.581
Come on!

13:06.615 --> 13:08.216
It's on the tip of my tongue.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.718
Yeah, along with
this gum ball... suck it.

13:10.752 --> 13:12.820
[Laughter]

13:16.625 --> 13:18.493
What's the answer?

13:18.527 --> 13:19.861
- Mike?
- It's wong.

13:19.895 --> 13:23.064
What's the magic word
that Billy Batson has to say

13:23.098 --> 13:25.066
to turn into captain marvel?

13:25.100 --> 13:27.101
- "Shazam"?
- Correct.

13:27.136 --> 13:28.603
Look at me with no gum.

13:30.372 --> 13:34.108
First appearance of
lobo was in what issue?

13:34.143 --> 13:36.010
<i>It was Omega Men number 6.</i>

13:36.044 --> 13:38.012
Mikey z, you have to eat a gum ball.

13:38.046 --> 13:39.580
Oh!

13:39.615 --> 13:40.615
It was 3.

13:40.649 --> 13:42.316
Put those dirty balls in your mouth.

13:42.351 --> 13:44.519
[Laughter]

13:44.553 --> 13:47.321
Which teen character

13:47.356 --> 13:49.891
<i>was not a friend
of The Hulk...</i>

13:49.925 --> 13:52.693
Rick Jones, snapper carr,

13:52.728 --> 13:55.196
or Jim Wilson?
Jim Wilson.

13:55.230 --> 13:57.698
- Oh, my God, you're a fool.
- Was it Jim Wilson?

13:57.733 --> 14:00.268
It was snapper car

14:00.302 --> 14:02.003
oh... [laughter]

14:02.037 --> 14:03.738
What's wrong?

14:03.772 --> 14:05.339
[Guys chuckling]

14:05.374 --> 14:06.774
Terrible.

14:06.808 --> 14:08.776
<i>In secret wars 2,</i>

14:08.810 --> 14:10.978
Spider-Man taught the beyonder

14:11.013 --> 14:13.080
to "a," kiss,

14:13.115 --> 14:16.150
"b," bathe,

14:16.185 --> 14:19.020
or "c," to do number 2.

14:19.054 --> 14:21.822
I'm gonna have to go with kiss, then.

14:21.857 --> 14:24.058
- Mike, what was it?
- Taught him how to take a crap.

14:24.092 --> 14:26.327
- Yep.
- Ow!

14:26.361 --> 14:29.764
Mike, name Tarzan's son.

14:29.798 --> 14:31.632
- Boy.
- Ooh.

14:31.667 --> 14:33.134
I was looking for Korak.

14:33.168 --> 14:34.902
Okay. You're looking for the comics.

14:34.937 --> 14:36.437
Have to go to the judges.

14:36.471 --> 14:38.239
- Give him a ball.
- Yeah.

14:38.273 --> 14:40.007
[Laughing]

14:40.042 --> 14:42.276
All right,
ming. Lockjaw...

14:42.311 --> 14:44.212
Which is what you're on
your road to right here...

14:44.246 --> 14:45.479
- Yes.
- Is the member

14:45.514 --> 14:48.216
of what super group?
Fearsome four.

14:48.250 --> 14:49.784
- Oh, my God, you...
- Whoa...

14:49.818 --> 14:52.486
- It's disgusting.
- Crap.

14:52.521 --> 14:54.488
[Laughter]

14:54.523 --> 14:57.358
- Who all was it, Mike?
- The inhumane.

14:57.392 --> 14:59.894
The moon knight has
a symbol on his chest.

14:59.928 --> 15:01.162
What is it?

15:01.196 --> 15:02.463
I'm gonna say it's a Crescent moon.

15:02.497 --> 15:03.931
Booyah.

15:03.966 --> 15:06.601
Ming's in diabetic shock right now.

15:06.635 --> 15:09.670
Mike, the official first appearance

15:09.705 --> 15:12.139
of the new teen titans was in what issue?

15:12.174 --> 15:14.008
<i>DC comics presents...</i>

15:14.042 --> 15:15.977
Number 26.

15:16.011 --> 15:17.612
Correct!

15:17.646 --> 15:19.280
The justice league of America...

15:19.314 --> 15:20.581
Yes.

15:20.616 --> 15:22.116
What was their first headquarters?

15:22.150 --> 15:24.518
What, like a building?
It was a building.

15:24.553 --> 15:26.487
- He wants the gum.
- What was it, Mike?

15:26.521 --> 15:27.755
- It was a cave.
- A cave?

15:27.789 --> 15:29.257
I don't remember the cave.

15:29.291 --> 15:31.158
Has he gotten any questions right?

15:31.193 --> 15:32.760
- No!
- No, not one.

15:32.794 --> 15:34.495
And people are like,
"why do you pick on ming?"

15:34.529 --> 15:35.663
He works in a comic-book store!

15:35.697 --> 15:37.064
[Muffled] I'll get the next one.

15:37.099 --> 15:39.567
Let's move on.
[Laughs]

15:39.601 --> 15:41.636
All right, Bryan, super goof from Disney?

15:41.670 --> 15:43.170
- Mm
- hmm.

15:43.205 --> 15:45.806
What did he eat to turn into super goof?

15:45.841 --> 15:48.342
Was it "a," bananas,

15:48.377 --> 15:50.511
"b," candy,

15:50.545 --> 15:52.413
or "c," peanuts?

15:52.447 --> 15:54.782
Bananas... way too phallic.

15:54.816 --> 15:56.984
[Laughter]

15:57.019 --> 15:59.654
I don't think Disney's gonna
allow him to eat bananas.

15:59.688 --> 16:02.657
Uh, I'm gonna go with peanuts.

16:02.691 --> 16:04.725
It was peanuts.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.661
This could be it, right?

16:06.695 --> 16:09.930
[Ming muttering, laughter]

16:09.965 --> 16:11.565
Your last chance at redemption.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.100
Are you ready?
[Mutters]

16:13.135 --> 16:15.970
The werewolf by night's real identity

16:16.004 --> 16:17.438
is "a," Bruce banner,

16:17.472 --> 16:19.573
"b," Billy Batson,

16:19.608 --> 16:21.909
or "c," Jack Russell?

16:23.578 --> 16:25.179
"B", Billy Batson.

16:25.213 --> 16:27.948
What an asswipe. Even I know that!

16:27.983 --> 16:30.284
Even I know that!
Are you not even trying?

16:30.319 --> 16:31.686
- I'm trying!
- He wants the gum.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.688
Eat the gum.

16:33.722 --> 16:35.923
This is disgusting!

16:35.957 --> 16:37.525
Come on, goat boy.

16:37.559 --> 16:39.026
[Laughter]

16:39.225 --> 16:40.590
_

16:40.629 --> 16:41.996
what?

16:42.170 --> 16:43.530
_

16:43.598 --> 16:45.833
I can still understand you.

16:45.985 --> 16:47.395
_

16:47.436 --> 16:49.804
can somebody get him a spittle cup?

16:51.023 --> 16:52.353
_

16:52.523 --> 16:53.123
_

16:53.275 --> 16:54.575
well, tap out, then,
if you want to quit.

16:54.609 --> 16:56.777
Shameful.

16:56.812 --> 16:58.713
- I got something here.
- Let's take a look.

16:58.747 --> 17:00.381
What is it?

17:00.415 --> 17:02.917
Samaritan...
Hellboy's gun, man.

17:08.981 --> 17:10.781
Oh, hey, how you doing?
How's it going, man?

17:10.816 --> 17:12.217
- What's up?
- I got something here

17:12.251 --> 17:15.053
hopefully you guys'll be
a little bit interested in.

17:15.087 --> 17:16.721
Let's take a look. What is it?

17:18.523 --> 17:20.525
Samaritan...
Hellboy's gun, man.

17:28.067 --> 17:30.168
You a Hellboy fan?
Uh, yeah, I like Hellboy.

17:30.202 --> 17:31.369
I love Hellboy.

17:31.404 --> 17:32.971
I mean, you have to
be a huge Hellboy fan.

17:33.005 --> 17:34.673
You love hell.

17:34.707 --> 17:35.941
[Laughter]
Can I open it up?

17:35.975 --> 17:37.709
- Yeah, absolutely.
- You want to open it up for me?

17:37.743 --> 17:39.711
Mike Mignola is a genius.

17:39.745 --> 17:41.379
Have you guys ever seen the movies?

17:41.414 --> 17:42.547
I love the movies.

17:42.581 --> 17:43.982
Whoa!

17:44.016 --> 17:45.650
If you want to check
it out, here you go.

17:45.685 --> 17:46.918
Yeah.

17:46.953 --> 17:50.588
Is this one of the most
famous guns in film history?

17:50.623 --> 17:51.890
I mean, there's that.

17:51.924 --> 17:53.658
<i>There's the one deckard
uses in blade runner.</i>

17:53.693 --> 17:55.226
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Dirty Harry's gun.

17:55.261 --> 17:57.629
- Dirty Harry.
- I'd say Han Solo's blaster.

17:57.663 --> 17:58.964
That's famous? -
I don't know... is it?

17:58.998 --> 18:00.465
Yeah, it's famous.

18:00.499 --> 18:02.233
It's as famous as Deckard's gun

18:02.268 --> 18:04.469
or Hellboy's samaritan.

18:04.503 --> 18:05.704
Hellboy's samaritan

18:05.738 --> 18:08.440
is the top gun in comic-book history.

18:08.474 --> 18:10.675
I mean, generally comics
don't feature guns that heavily.

18:10.710 --> 18:12.110
Like, now that we're talking about it,

18:12.144 --> 18:14.696
I can't think of many famous guns in comics

18:14.747 --> 18:17.649
except one... the most
famous gun in comics,

18:17.683 --> 18:20.552
the replica
they'll never sell...

18:20.586 --> 18:22.988
Joe chill's gun... the gun
that kills Batman's parents.

18:23.022 --> 18:24.489
- Oh, yeah.
- There's really

18:24.523 --> 18:26.858
no guns in comics for that...
Maybe not just that reason,

18:26.892 --> 18:28.626
but think about it.

18:28.661 --> 18:30.228
Like, Batman the hero is predicated on

18:30.262 --> 18:32.230
use of a gun gone wrong,

18:32.264 --> 18:33.798
killing his parents and stuff.

18:33.833 --> 18:35.400
So he swears it off.

18:35.434 --> 18:37.869
So where'd you get this at?

18:37.903 --> 18:39.504
I actually got it
by way of a flea market

18:39.538 --> 18:40.638
in Norfolk, Virginia...
Doing the rounds,

18:40.673 --> 18:42.340
trying to get, like, old issues of stuff,

18:42.375 --> 18:43.842
and this kind of caught my eye.

18:43.876 --> 18:45.710
- You a big Mignola fan?
- Absolutely.

18:45.745 --> 18:47.178
All the dark horse stuff,

18:47.213 --> 18:49.681
all the B.P.R.D., Hellboy,

18:49.715 --> 18:53.184
all his covers he did for
early do and marvel stuff too.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.120
I'm just gonna say it.

18:55.154 --> 18:56.588
I think he's amazing.

18:56.622 --> 18:58.790
What's your thoughts on
Hellboy, Mike Mignola?

18:58.824 --> 19:01.259
Pretty much a genius, right?
He's a great, great artist.

19:01.293 --> 19:03.928
I dug the character of Hellboy,

19:03.963 --> 19:06.965
but I remember Mignola was a
tough sell for me originally

19:06.999 --> 19:11.136
<i>'cause he did the covers for
Batman: A death in the family,</i>

19:11.170 --> 19:14.139
and he drew what I described as fat Batman,

19:14.173 --> 19:16.758
'cause he was very thick
and very jowly and stuff,

19:16.809 --> 19:19.177
and I was like, "I don't like fat Batman."

19:19.211 --> 19:21.179
And Walt was like, "this guy's a genius!

19:21.213 --> 19:22.881
This guy's an absolute genius!"

19:22.915 --> 19:24.199
<i>And then he brought me to Hellboy</i>

19:24.233 --> 19:25.483
when that first came out.

19:25.517 --> 19:26.718
You were like, "look at this!"

19:26.752 --> 19:29.420
That character I put
up there in the top five

19:29.438 --> 19:32.257
creator-owned characters
in comic-book history.

19:32.291 --> 19:33.992
So why are you looking to sell it today?

19:34.026 --> 19:36.027
Um, it's just a little...

19:36.062 --> 19:37.796
It's a great piece,
but it's a little Awkwar

19:37.830 --> 19:39.030
to be sitting on the coffee table.

19:39.065 --> 19:41.132
It's something that doesn't really

19:41.167 --> 19:43.101
explain itself easily like a superman logo

19:43.135 --> 19:45.036
or a Batman cape or anything like that.

19:45.071 --> 19:47.305
It is a, "hey, you have a
gun on your coffee table."

19:47.339 --> 19:50.708
Okay. What are you
looking to get for it?

19:50.743 --> 19:52.911
In the neighborhood of 500 bucks.

19:52.945 --> 19:54.679
- Ooh.
- That's a park Avenue

19:54.713 --> 19:56.214
neighborhood.

19:56.248 --> 19:58.616
Um...

19:58.651 --> 20:01.052
I think that's a little high for the piece.

20:01.087 --> 20:03.054
Um...

20:03.089 --> 20:04.489
Would you take $200 for it?

20:04.523 --> 20:06.491
There's no way I could take $200 for it.

20:06.525 --> 20:08.726
- No?
- Absolutely not.

20:08.761 --> 20:10.095
Well, throw me another number, then.

20:10.129 --> 20:11.496
Uh, let's see...

20:11.530 --> 20:14.265
Comfortably $450?

20:14.300 --> 20:16.301
Comfortably? For you only.

20:18.370 --> 20:20.205
How about $300?

20:20.239 --> 20:22.173
I can't go $300.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.742
I can meet you at $400 easily.

20:24.777 --> 20:27.212
$350?

20:28.514 --> 20:29.714
$380?

20:32.051 --> 20:33.918
$375?

20:33.953 --> 20:35.153
I can do $375.

20:35.187 --> 20:37.655
- I guess we got a deal, then.
- Yeah.

20:37.690 --> 20:38.890
[Laughter]

20:39.953 --> 20:41.150
All right, man, have a great day.

20:41.185 --> 20:41.850
Thanks man.

20:41.850 --> 20:42.967
All right, thanks.
