He's a murderer.

19:35.392 --> 19:38.162
That's what he is.
He is a fucking murderer.

19:38.195 --> 19:39.996
Okay. Look.

19:40.029 --> 19:44.000
Here's a little bit of, uh,
family folklore for you.

19:44.033 --> 19:46.670
So he had this little kid.

19:46.703 --> 19:50.073
Um, what's-his-name, uh,
my half brother Timmy. Timmy.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.676
And Timmy had a disease,
other than being born a Getty.

19:52.709 --> 19:53.877
(chuckles)

19:53.910 --> 19:55.479
Some, uh,
congenital heart thing.

19:55.512 --> 19:56.646
He's dying, okay?

19:56.680 --> 19:58.248
He's actually dying.

19:58.282 --> 20:00.350
And he writes to the old man,
who's in Europe,

20:00.384 --> 20:02.919
you know, screwing his way
through a succession of women,

20:02.952 --> 20:05.189
making enough money
to fill swimming pools,

20:05.222 --> 20:07.056
"Daddy, I'm dying.

20:07.090 --> 20:08.258
"Please come home.

20:08.292 --> 20:11.094
I want to see you again
before I die."

20:11.127 --> 20:14.097
What do you think
the old man does?

20:14.130 --> 20:16.132
Sends him a letter.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.270
"Sorry, Timmy,
unable to travel.

20:20.304 --> 20:22.606
Your loving father."

20:22.639 --> 20:25.675
I mean, can you believe that?

20:25.709 --> 20:27.911
And he dies.

20:27.944 --> 20:30.947
Timmy dies without actually
seeing his father again.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.350
And does the loving father
attend his own son's funeral?

20:33.383 --> 20:34.584
What do you think, friends?

20:35.819 --> 20:38.322
Unable to fucking travel.

20:39.756 --> 20:41.458
And what about George?

20:41.491 --> 20:45.128
Huh? Drove him into an early
grave, that is for goddamn sure.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.596
But this.

20:46.630 --> 20:48.432
This time he has gone too far.

20:48.465 --> 20:49.833
This is actual murder.

20:52.969 --> 20:54.137
What I am gonna do for him,

20:54.170 --> 20:55.305
I am gonna go up there,

20:55.339 --> 20:57.774
and I am gonna tell him

20:57.807 --> 20:59.309
what we all actually think,

20:59.343 --> 21:02.546
and the truth will destroy him.

21:04.748 --> 21:08.485
It will completely destroy him.

-No, thank you.

34:33.389 --> 34:36.392
I'm afraid I've made
other plans this weekend.

34:36.425 --> 34:38.261
Other plans?

34:38.294 --> 34:40.763

35:39.388 --> 35:42.625
You must put this
behind you. Eat.

35:42.658 --> 35:45.994
I didn't know.
I didn't know.

35:46.028 --> 35:50.266
What did you think
would happen to him, hmm?

35:50.299 --> 35:52.735
We take his pocket money away?

35:56.239 --> 35:57.473
You killed him.

35:57.506 --> 35:59.208
No. No, I didn't.

35:59.242 --> 36:01.610
I-I didn't shoot him.

36:01.644 --> 36:03.212
This is not Rome.

36:03.246 --> 36:04.847
We have nothing here,

36:04.880 --> 36:08.184
and you promised him something.

36:08.217 --> 36:10.519
Whether you held the gun or not,

36:10.553 --> 36:12.020
you killed him

36:12.054 --> 36:14.223
and the old man, too.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.862
Grow up, cazzo.

36:19.895 --> 36:22.698
Take responsibility!

36:28.537 --> 36:31.540
You are lucky to be alive.

36:31.574 --> 36:34.577
So stay alive.
Eat, cazzo!

36:45.254 --> 36:47.390
Okay.

-PAUL JR.: Hey!

36:55.431 --> 36:56.965
-A happy day, madam.
-Open up!

36:56.999 --> 37:00.336
-Yes, it is.
-(pounding on door)

37:02.538 --> 37:04.340
-Good day, sir.
-Fuck off, Bullimore.

37:04.373 --> 37:05.674
Where is the old bastard, huh?

37:05.708 --> 37:07.009
Where is he?

37:07.042 --> 37:10.213
PAUL:
I assume you're referring to me.

37:14.917 --> 37:18.521
You have been drinking.

37:18.554 --> 37:20.523
I have.

37:20.556 --> 37:23.058
And, no doubt,
been taking drugs.

37:23.091 --> 37:25.694
(scoffs)
Correct again.

37:27.463 --> 37:30.599
Well, there's no flies
on the old man, Bullimore.

37:30.633 --> 37:32.568
He can spot a loser
when he sees one.

37:32.601 --> 37:34.303
He's an expert.

37:34.337 --> 37:38.274
It's the spécialité
de la maison.

37:38.307 --> 37:42.278
Is there a purpose
to this visit?

37:42.311 --> 37:45.113
My purpose is to deliver

37:45.147 --> 37:47.816
my congratulations to you

37:47.850 --> 37:50.819
in person, pater-- bravo.

37:50.853 --> 37:53.256
You have moved on

37:53.289 --> 37:56.124
from killing your sons

37:56.158 --> 37:58.160
with your own particular
brand of sadism

37:58.193 --> 38:00.095
to killing your grandsons.

38:00.128 --> 38:01.264
Bravo.

38:03.999 --> 38:06.101
-But I haven't.
-No.

38:06.134 --> 38:09.505
No, no.
No, of course not.

38:09.538 --> 38:12.040
It's nothing to do with you.

38:12.074 --> 38:15.711
It's not your idea
to sit on your hands

38:15.744 --> 38:18.347
doing fuck-all for weeks.

38:18.381 --> 38:21.550
Not your idea
to offer the princely sum

38:21.584 --> 38:26.121
of $600 for the life of Paul,
your grandson!

38:26.154 --> 38:29.358
My beautiful baby boy.

38:29.392 --> 38:32.227
You fuckin' murderer!

38:32.261 --> 38:34.897
You might as well have put
your hands around his throat

38:34.930 --> 38:37.566
and throttled him dead!

38:41.570 --> 38:43.439
Except he isn't.

38:46.442 --> 38:49.878
Dead... I mean.

39:07.095 --> 39:10.065
I-I don't understand.

39:10.098 --> 39:11.567
PAUL:
Evidently.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.402
Well, but...

39:13.436 --> 39:16.071
Alive and well.

39:18.441 --> 39:20.609
Well, I-I thought...

40:13.195 --> 40:14.430
A most extraordinary thing.

40:14.463 --> 40:17.633
Two things.

40:17.666 --> 40:21.269
The boy, Paul?

40:21.303 --> 40:24.306
It wasn't him on the beach.

40:24.339 --> 40:25.774
The boy's alive.

40:25.808 --> 40:28.644
Is he?
Wonderful.

40:28.677 --> 40:31.814
But even more extraordinary,

40:31.847 --> 40:35.183
I... have the day off.

Marvelous.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.801

I was going to meet you.

40:52.835 --> 40:56.371

Actually, I've got
some other news.

41:38.213 --> 41:39.682
I don't know how it happened.

41:39.715 --> 41:41.717
Well, obviously I do.

Paul, I'm...

You're in breach of contract.

42:03.405 --> 42:05.608
I'm aware of that,
but I just thought

42:05.641 --> 42:08.243
we might perhaps...

42:08.276 --> 42:09.745
Maybe we could renegotiate.

42:09.778 --> 42:12.280

been paying attention.

the other was a translator.
