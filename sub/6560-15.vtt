cursed the family...

16:17.018 --> 16:18.937
Wait a minute.

16:20.981 --> 16:25.569
-Jinkies. That's it.
-Thanks for my glasses, Velma.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.530
Right, Jimmy, here they are.

16:30.073 --> 16:32.450
Come on, Jimmy, you can do it.

16:34.494 --> 16:38.290
ANNOUNCER: And Jimmy Pelton
is starting to make an amazing comeback.

16:38.456 --> 16:41.585
-Do you hear that, Scoob?
-Yeah.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.336
[GROWLS]

16:44.045 --> 16:46.381
Like, | heard your stomach growling,
Scooby...

16:46.548 --> 16:49.551
...but did you have to eat
my hot dog too?

16:49.718 --> 16:52.345
Not me, Shaggy.

17:07.611 --> 17:09.695
SHAGGY:
Faster, Scoob.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.244
I'll find you two.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.716
[IN ENGLISH ACCENT]
| say, old chap, like, pardon me.

17:29.883 --> 17:30.926
SCOOBY:
Me too.

17:32.302 --> 17:33.595
[GROWLS]

17:36.056 --> 17:37.098
Uh-oh.

17:38.934 --> 17:40.644
Shaggy, look.

17:40.810 --> 17:44.272
ANNOUNCER: And the championship
doubles match is ready to begin.

17:44.439 --> 17:47.400
SHAGGY:
Like, how's your backhand, Scoob?

17:48.944 --> 17:50.195
SCOOBY:
A little shaky.

17:50.362 --> 17:53.823
ANNOUNCER: Game, set and match point,
Jimmy Pelton.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.493
One more point
and Jimmy's the champion.

17:56.660 --> 18:00.163
-Come on, Jimmy, come on.
-Come on, Jimmy.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.584
ANTHOS:
Jimmy Pelton.

18:06.086 --> 18:10.507
The curse remains, and you must lose.

18:10.966 --> 18:14.678
You must lose.

18:19.516 --> 18:20.850
Keep going, Scooby.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.355
Uh-oh. Ahh!

18:37.242 --> 18:38.410
Help!

18:38.576 --> 18:42.330
-Hold on, Scooby-Doo.
SCOOBY: Help!

18:42.956 --> 18:45.834
ANNOUNCER:
Come on, Pelton, play ball.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.007
A service ace.

18:52.173 --> 18:55.218
Jimmy Pelton is the new champion
of Wimbledon.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.721
[CHEERING]

19:00.056 --> 19:03.059
Oh, no, look.
The warlock's after Scooby.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.107
SCOOBY:
Shaggy!

19:09.899 --> 19:11.067
Oh, no.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.586
Mmm. Good.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.756
It's the warlock and devil hound.

19:35.925 --> 19:36.968
BOTH:
Huh?

19:37.135 --> 19:41.723
DAPHNE: And now to find out
who's behind the Warlock Anthos.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.268
Nick, you're the warlock? But...

19:46.102 --> 19:49.981
Follow me.
There's another warlock on the loose.

19:50.190 --> 19:53.902
Now, if | use the zoom lens,
| should be able to--

19:54.069 --> 19:56.529
That's him, the one with the briefcase.

20:04.162 --> 20:07.290
But, Velma,
he doesn't even look like the warlock.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.795
Oh, no?
Just look through Jimmy's glasses.

20:13.296 --> 20:16.299
Like, zoinks.
He looks like a warlock now.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.762
Nick substituted these glasses for
Jimmy's when they fell off in the woods.

20:20.929 --> 20:24.974
They have lenses that make it possible
to see this normally invisible makeup...

20:25.141 --> 20:27.560
...which transforms
an ordinary-looking man...

20:27.727 --> 20:29.979
...into the warlock.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.481
That's right.

20:31.648 --> 20:35.151
This bill of sale | found
was what clued me onto the trick.

20:35.318 --> 20:39.364
But if the warlock was a fake,
how did his staff keep following me?

20:39.531 --> 20:42.200
Simple.
There was more than one staff.

20:42.367 --> 20:46.871
The two warlocks carved them
in that secret workshop under the ruins.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.832
But who is the other warlock?

20:48.998 --> 20:52.502
-He's John, the gatekeeper.
-But how did you know?

20:52.669 --> 20:57.006
The first clue to his identity was
the red mud on the gatekeeper's boot.

20:57.173 --> 21:00.093
And the red mud
is only found near the ruins...

21:00.260 --> 21:02.262
...which proved he'd been there
recently.

21:02.429 --> 21:05.598
And he wore the special boots
with the fake paws...

21:05.765 --> 21:09.853
...S0 we'd think only the hound
left his cottage.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.354
But why, John?

21:11.521 --> 21:15.108
I'm more than just your gatekeeper.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.235
Nick and | are brothers.

21:17.402 --> 21:19.696
We're descendants
of the Warlock Anthos.

21:19.863 --> 21:22.699
And we wanted Pelton Manor
for our own.

21:22.866 --> 21:27.287
When you lost the match and the estate,
we were going to buy it.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.373
And the revenge of Anthos
would have been complete.

21:30.540 --> 21:34.586
We would have succeeded
if it weren't for you meddling kids.

21:37.589 --> 21:41.050
Like, try these on for size, Scooby.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.598
Yikes!

21:48.224 --> 21:49.809
Like, what's the matter, Scoob?

21:49.976 --> 21:53.480
You look like
you've just seen a devil hound.

21:58.651 --> 22:02.572
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
