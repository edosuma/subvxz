00:11.200 --> 00:14.920
[Ken] Mmm. Dr. Lucy Worsley?

00:15.480 --> 00:18.000
Oh! Interesting.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.040
Go away, David Starkey!

00:20.200 --> 00:23.040
Go away!

00:23.880 --> 00:25.400
You have no place here!

00:25.440 --> 00:26.600
[baby cooing]

00:26.640 --> 00:30.680
[baby crying]

00:31.720 --> 00:33.960
Ah, you're joking!

00:35.800 --> 00:38.200
[baby continues crying]

00:41.520 --> 00:42.360
[sighs]

00:42.880 --> 00:44.560
You jammy cow.

00:45.640 --> 00:49.280
[theme music playing]

00:50.360 --> 00:53.160
Henry Tudor ascended

00:50.360 --> 00:53.160
to the throne,

00:53.200 --> 00:56.760
his Yorkish bride

00:53.200 --> 00:56.760
at his side.

00:56.800 --> 01:01.080
And that is Ken Thompson's

00:56.800 --> 01:01.080
world famous history,

01:01.120 --> 01:02.400
<i>The War of the Roses.</i>

01:02.440 --> 01:04.160
Any comment from you?

01:04.200 --> 01:06.560
-Any insightful analysis?

01:04.200 --> 01:06.560
-[baby screams]

01:06.600 --> 01:09.240
No? Oh, god,

01:06.600 --> 01:09.240
here we go.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.520
[sighs]

01:09.280 --> 01:11.520
Why paternity leave? Why?

01:13.480 --> 01:16.800
Oh, hello.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.760
Yes, I do deserve them.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.760
[roars, chuckles]

01:40.800 --> 01:41.640
Hi, Ben.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.600
Sorry today is going

01:42.680 --> 01:45.600
very slowly.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.800
Ah, still upset about Dale?

01:47.840 --> 01:49.480
You pined

01:47.840 --> 01:49.480
for him for ages

01:49.520 --> 01:52.360
and then he came back

01:49.520 --> 01:52.360
head over heels

01:49.520 --> 01:52.360
in love with someone else.

01:52.400 --> 01:55.280
I wasn't thinking

01:52.400 --> 01:55.280
about that, but thanks

01:52.400 --> 01:55.280
for the reminder.

01:55.320 --> 01:59.360
No problemo,

01:55.320 --> 01:59.360
and prepare for your day

01:55.320 --> 01:59.360
to be turned around,

01:59.400 --> 02:01.600
because someone

01:59.400 --> 02:01.600
is getting a promotion.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.640
-It's you!

02:03.560 --> 02:05.640
-A promotion?

02:05.680 --> 02:07.360
Ben, I never

02:05.680 --> 02:07.360
applied for anything.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.560
Okay, so Cathy's retiring

02:07.400 --> 02:10.560
as office manager.

02:10.600 --> 02:14.600
And Jane wanted

02:10.600 --> 02:14.600
a settled mother hen

02:10.600 --> 02:14.600
type figure for the office.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.840
I looked her

02:14.640 --> 02:17.840
straight in the eyes

02:14.640 --> 02:17.840
and I said, "Rachel.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.160
The mother hen

02:17.880 --> 02:20.160
you want is Rachel."

02:20.200 --> 02:22.040
Okay, Ben, I didn't

02:20.200 --> 02:22.040
ask you to--

02:22.080 --> 02:26.240
Almost 8k more,

02:22.080 --> 02:26.240
and there's a guaranteed

02:22.080 --> 02:26.240
12 months full maternity cover,

02:26.280 --> 02:29.560
should you ever, you know,

02:26.280 --> 02:29.560
wanna settle down with someone.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.600
So, what do you think?

02:31.640 --> 02:33.440
-[Rachel sobbing]

02:31.640 --> 02:33.440
-Rachel, please!

02:33.480 --> 02:35.280
Please stop crying.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.800
It's unfathomable!

02:36.840 --> 02:40.480
[sobbing]

02:36.840 --> 02:40.480
I'm interesting, Ben!

02:36.840 --> 02:40.480
I've seen the world!

02:40.520 --> 02:43.040
I've read Paolo Coelho.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.480
I do not want to be

02:43.080 --> 02:45.480
an office manager!

02:45.520 --> 02:47.840
But you're

02:45.520 --> 02:47.840
an office assistant.

02:47.880 --> 02:49.680
It's the way

02:47.880 --> 02:49.680
the world works.

02:49.720 --> 02:54.720
I'd imagine that Paulo Coelho

02:49.720 --> 02:54.720
was an assistant

02:49.720 --> 02:54.720
inspirational novelist.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.000
[sobbing]

02:56.040 --> 02:59.440
But what if I need

02:56.040 --> 02:59.440
more with my life, Ben!

02:59.480 --> 03:02.240
Are we talking

02:59.480 --> 03:02.240
a sideways move into HR?

03:02.840 --> 03:05.120
No!

03:05.160 --> 03:09.080
No? But don't dismiss it

03:05.160 --> 03:09.080
out of hand, it's got

03:05.160 --> 03:09.080
great career progression.

03:17.120 --> 03:17.920
Dale.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.320
When you were a business man,

03:21.360 --> 03:24.160
what area were you in exactly?

03:24.200 --> 03:27.720
Well, my boss Mr. Xi,

03:24.200 --> 03:27.720
insisted on secrecy

03:24.200 --> 03:27.720
in all his dealings.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.400
Little quirk of his. [laughs]

03:29.440 --> 03:32.240
But, uh, I was across

03:29.440 --> 03:32.240
a few areas.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.560
Client-facing.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.560
Results oriented.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.200
Sorry, if I'm

03:34.600 --> 03:37.200
bamboozling you

03:34.600 --> 03:37.200
with all this jargon.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.760
Well, I must say,

03:37.240 --> 03:39.760
it all sounds

03:37.240 --> 03:39.760
very impressive!

03:39.800 --> 03:42.000
-[Rachel] Hey, guys.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.000
-Oh, Mom, you're home.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.440
-How was your day?

03:42.040 --> 03:44.440
-Yeah, fine.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.000
I hope you're hungry.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.560
It's<i> Di Shui Dong</i> ribs

03:46.040 --> 03:48.560
with braised eggplant.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.000
-Oh, sounds tasty.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.000
-Always Ling's favorite.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.200
Yeah, I'll probably just

03:52.040 --> 03:54.200
have it in my room.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.360
Something's up

03:59.520 --> 04:01.360
with Mom.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.440
I mean, ever since

04:01.400 --> 04:03.440
I got back from China,

04:03.480 --> 04:06.000
she seems to be acting

04:03.480 --> 04:06.000
really cold towards me.

04:06.040 --> 04:10.440
Well, it can be hard,

04:06.040 --> 04:10.440
can't it?

04:10.480 --> 04:14.200
Getting reacquainted

04:10.480 --> 04:14.200
with people you've had

04:10.480 --> 04:14.200
a thing with.

04:14.240 --> 04:17.240
Oh! [chuckles] Well, yes,

04:14.240 --> 04:17.240
but not in this instance.

04:17.280 --> 04:18.680
You see,

04:17.280 --> 04:18.680
before I went away,

04:18.720 --> 04:21.480
Rachel told me it was wrong

04:18.720 --> 04:21.480
that I was in love with her.

04:21.520 --> 04:24.600
So now I've found love

04:21.520 --> 04:24.600
with Ling who is amazing

04:21.520 --> 04:24.600
by the way,

04:24.640 --> 04:27.720
my friendship with Rachel

04:24.640 --> 04:27.720
should be blossoming

04:24.640 --> 04:27.720
as never before.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.120
[Ken] Hello, my family!

04:30.160 --> 04:33.920
Ooh, someone's

04:30.160 --> 04:33.920
had a nice day!

04:30.160 --> 04:33.920
Sid on good form?

04:33.960 --> 04:36.160
Sidney was his

04:33.960 --> 04:36.160
usual truculent self.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.080
But Daddy has found

04:36.200 --> 04:39.080
something to put

04:36.200 --> 04:39.080
a spring in his step.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.560
Really? What's that?

04:41.560 --> 04:44.320
Ooh, tasty!

04:45.840 --> 04:48.200
Ruby red and bright

04:45.840 --> 04:48.200
as a button.

04:48.240 --> 04:51.160
A colorful trouser

04:48.240 --> 04:51.160
for a happy fellow.

04:51.200 --> 04:55.280
Who is this jaunty gentleman

04:51.200 --> 04:55.280
peacocking his way around

04:51.200 --> 04:55.280
the Lichfield scene?

04:55.320 --> 04:56.760
Why, it is I, Kenneth!

04:56.800 --> 04:58.400
You're having

04:56.800 --> 04:58.400
a mid-life crisis.

04:58.440 --> 05:04.320
Oh, shut up.

04:58.440 --> 05:04.320
Feast your eyes on the rich

04:58.440 --> 05:04.320
and velvety material.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.320
Wow! Are those

05:04.360 --> 05:06.320
traditional costume Ken?

05:06.360 --> 05:07.640
Yes, Dale.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.880
As traditionally worn

05:07.680 --> 05:09.880
by Laurence Llewelyn Bowen.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.280
-I'm a shining star

05:09.920 --> 05:12.280
of manhood.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.280
-I'll burn them.

05:12.320 --> 05:15.480
You'll have to burn

05:12.320 --> 05:15.480
my legs then. 'Cause

05:12.320 --> 05:15.480
they're not coming off.

05:15.520 --> 05:19.400
Ha-ha. You did it, Dad,

05:15.520 --> 05:19.400
you brought twat to the

05:15.520 --> 05:19.400
next level. You bell-end!

05:19.440 --> 05:22.000
-Hey can I have a lift?

05:19.440 --> 05:22.000
-No. Where are you going?

05:22.040 --> 05:24.240
Seeing Zoe.

05:22.040 --> 05:24.240
It's a week till

05:22.040 --> 05:24.240
she goes to uni.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.640
-I think I can get

05:24.280 --> 05:27.640
to ten more shags.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.640
-[Ken] Ugh.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.840
But I have to see her

05:27.680 --> 05:29.840
every day. Mum, lift?

05:29.880 --> 05:32.320
All right.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.320
For young love.

05:32.360 --> 05:35.400
Guys! Oh, god,

05:32.360 --> 05:35.400
it's like an omen!

05:35.440 --> 05:38.200
Practically the first job

05:35.440 --> 05:38.200
to come up and it is perfect.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.240
Since when are you

05:38.240 --> 05:40.240
looking for a job?

05:40.280 --> 05:44.080
Since I realized I couldn't

05:40.280 --> 05:44.080
spend another day in that

05:40.280 --> 05:44.080
office full of deadbeats.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.160
That would be

05:44.120 --> 05:46.160
my office then.

05:46.200 --> 05:49.800
Yep. There's a new position

05:46.200 --> 05:49.800
at this ace Human Rights

05:46.200 --> 05:49.800
charity, The Pegasus Alliance.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.240
-Oh, Nina runs that.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.240
-Ooh!

05:51.280 --> 05:54.360
Yes, that's Nina's.

05:51.280 --> 05:54.360
She speaks of it relentlessly.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.800
I'm making a start on

05:54.400 --> 05:56.800
the application now.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.640
-Oh, yes! Food! [giggles]

05:56.840 --> 05:59.640
-Here you go, Mom.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.680
Lovely, thank you,

05:59.680 --> 06:01.680
delicious.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.880
-Oh! Nice trousers. [laughs]

06:01.720 --> 06:03.880
-I thank you.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.440
-Give them me.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.440
-Never!

06:05.480 --> 06:07.960
-No, I'm gonna burn them.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.960
-You're not going to burn them.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.880
-Come, Sidney.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.880
-I cannot see them...

06:09.920 --> 06:13.920
Ignore her!

06:09.920 --> 06:13.920
I am the red pantalooned

06:09.920 --> 06:13.920
pied piper of all women!

06:16.600 --> 06:20.000
Uhh...

06:20.040 --> 06:25.400
Rachel, that is hands down

06:20.040 --> 06:25.400
the most moving job application

06:20.040 --> 06:25.400
I've ever read.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.120
I mean, uh...

06:27.160 --> 06:33.480
Your desolate days after

06:27.160 --> 06:33.480
Cuckoo died, your nights

06:27.160 --> 06:33.480
of sleepless crying. Oh!

06:33.520 --> 06:35.840
I don't know if I'm ever

06:33.520 --> 06:35.840
gonna be happy again.

06:35.880 --> 06:39.800
God! I really

06:35.880 --> 06:39.800
appreciate that, guys.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.720
I mean, I did put my heart

06:39.840 --> 06:42.720
and soul into it.

06:42.760 --> 06:46.360
Oh, Chief Ken,

06:42.760 --> 06:46.360
you have to read

06:42.760 --> 06:46.360
Rachel's job application.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.840
-It'll change your life.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.840
-Oh!

06:48.880 --> 06:51.400
It's the saddest book

06:48.880 --> 06:51.400
I've ever read. [sobs]

06:51.440 --> 06:53.120
And I've read

06:51.440 --> 06:53.120
five books.

06:53.160 --> 06:56.640
Really? That good is it?

06:56.680 --> 07:01.160
Any criticism, however small,

06:56.680 --> 07:01.160
is gratefully received. So...

07:01.200 --> 07:02.880
Okay, let's have a look.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.400
-It's quite full on.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.400
-Yeah.

07:20.920 --> 07:23.640
-How long is it

07:20.920 --> 07:23.640
until the deadline?

07:20.920 --> 07:23.640
-Midnight.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.560
Four hours? That's...

07:25.600 --> 07:28.920
That's not enough time.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.840
[keys clicking]

07:33.880 --> 07:36.480
Okay. Quarter of an hour to go.

07:33.880 --> 07:36.480
Come on, hand it in.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.760
Ken, how can it possibly

07:36.520 --> 07:38.760
need this much work?

07:38.800 --> 07:41.680
Don't blame me!

07:38.800 --> 07:41.680
I'm not the one who wrote

07:38.800 --> 07:41.680
a job application

07:41.720 --> 07:43.320
in the style

07:41.720 --> 07:43.320
of<i> Angela's Ashes.</i>

07:43.360 --> 07:46.480
-It says they're looking

07:43.360 --> 07:46.480
for someone creative.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.480
-Don't be naive.

07:46.520 --> 07:50.440
Creative means someone

07:46.520 --> 07:50.440
who'll take less money if

07:46.520 --> 07:50.440
they're allowed to wear jeans.

07:50.480 --> 07:55.600
There. It's ready.

07:50.480 --> 07:55.600
Your dad has saved the day.

07:55.640 --> 07:59.720
"I have good organization

07:55.640 --> 07:59.720
and experience of Excel."

07:59.760 --> 08:01.400
Ooh, this one's good too!

08:01.440 --> 08:05.600
Budge up, I'm just gonna

08:01.440 --> 08:05.600
upload it onto their server.

08:01.440 --> 08:05.600
And send.

08:06.640 --> 08:07.920
[Rachel sighs in relief]

08:09.560 --> 08:12.160
Okay. Why isn't it

08:09.560 --> 08:12.160
sending? Send.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.640
Dad, why isn't it sending?

08:15.680 --> 08:17.240
Well, hang on.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.640
[clamoring]

08:20.680 --> 08:22.440
What is wrong

08:20.680 --> 08:22.440
with this robot?

08:22.480 --> 08:27.080
-3, 2, 1. Midnight.

08:22.480 --> 08:27.080
-For God's sake. Come on.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.400
[Rachel] Bugger.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.440
[beeps]

08:31.480 --> 08:33.200
Oh, thank God!

08:31.480 --> 08:33.200
[sighs in relief]

08:33.240 --> 08:35.600
-Ah, there we are. Well done.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.600
-Oh! Thanks, Dad.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.160
Nearly gave me

08:35.640 --> 08:37.160
a heart attack.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.920
Well done. Close though.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.920
That was close.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.400
[beeps]

08:43.880 --> 08:46.160
"The deadline passed

08:43.880 --> 08:46.160
at midnight on the 21st.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.400
We are no longer

08:46.200 --> 08:48.400
considering applications."

08:48.440 --> 08:52.320
-Oh, bollocks.

08:48.440 --> 08:52.320
-What? Oh, fuck you!

08:53.920 --> 08:55.200
[sighs]

08:55.240 --> 08:57.880
Oh, well thanks a bunch, Dad.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.880
That really helped.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.320
What?

09:03.400 --> 09:06.240
-No way was that my fault.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.240
-Oh. Jesus, Ken.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.120
[knock at door]

09:14.480 --> 09:15.480
Go away.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.800
Hey, it's just Dale.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.800
You okay?

09:19.840 --> 09:21.480
I don't get it, Dale.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.640
Three years and not one thing

09:21.520 --> 09:24.640
has gone right for me.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.080
Am I cursed

09:24.680 --> 09:27.080
or something? [sighs]

09:27.120 --> 09:29.520
That is quite

09:27.120 --> 09:29.520
the run of bad luck, huh.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.960
First your husband died

09:29.560 --> 09:31.960
in the Himalayas,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.600
then the website froze.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.600
It's a double whammy.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.440
Close the door

09:34.640 --> 09:36.440
on your way out, okay?

09:37.120 --> 09:37.920
Yeah, I will do.

09:39.480 --> 09:42.520
Hey. You know what

09:39.480 --> 09:42.520
Mr. Xi used to say when

09:42.560 --> 09:45.040
a business decision

09:42.560 --> 09:45.040
or something

09:42.560 --> 09:45.040
didn't go his way?

09:45.080 --> 09:46.200
No.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.040
[speaking in Chinese]

09:46.240 --> 09:48.040
<i>Yug zjin yug yon.</i>

09:50.280 --> 09:55.360
Oh, it means the harder

09:50.280 --> 09:55.360
the battle, the more brave

09:50.280 --> 09:55.360
the men become.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.920
Dale, I don't know

09:55.400 --> 09:58.920
who's told you

09:55.400 --> 09:58.920
you're a businessman,

09:58.960 --> 10:02.840
but as far as I can tell

09:58.960 --> 10:02.840
all you seem to do is wear

09:58.960 --> 10:02.840
a suit and sunglasses...

10:02.880 --> 10:03.920
indoors.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.840
No, no, I have skills.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.840
I can help you.

10:06.880 --> 10:11.120
No. Unless you can make

10:06.880 --> 10:11.120
Nina take a late submission

10:06.880 --> 10:11.120
for this job, you can't.

10:11.720 --> 10:12.720
[Rachel sighs]

10:14.480 --> 10:15.880
[Ken sighs]

10:15.920 --> 10:18.280
You try your best

10:15.920 --> 10:18.280
to help and what

10:15.920 --> 10:18.280
thanks do you get?

10:18.320 --> 10:21.440
Sid's the most direct,

10:18.320 --> 10:21.440
he just goes ahead

10:18.320 --> 10:21.440
and defecates on me.

10:21.480 --> 10:25.640
Poor Rach. First Dale

10:21.480 --> 10:25.640
comes back mooning

10:21.480 --> 10:25.640
over some other girl.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.920
Then this job.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.320
She was really

10:26.960 --> 10:29.320
excited about it.

10:29.360 --> 10:33.040
I know. In many ways,

10:29.360 --> 10:33.040
that job was her

10:29.360 --> 10:33.040
red trousers.

10:33.080 --> 10:36.200
And what sort of evil witch

10:33.080 --> 10:36.200
denies a person their

10:33.080 --> 10:36.200
red trousers.

10:36.240 --> 10:37.720
[giggling]

10:37.760 --> 10:39.800
I can turn this around.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.800
I'll go and see

10:37.760 --> 10:39.800
Nina tomorrow.

10:39.840 --> 10:43.280
I'll see if the old

10:39.840 --> 10:43.280
Thompson silver tongue

10:39.840 --> 10:43.280
can persuade her.

10:43.320 --> 10:44.480
You vomited on her.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.480
That was ages ago.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.960
You punched her

10:45.520 --> 10:46.960
in the face.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.320
You completely ruined

10:47.000 --> 10:49.320
her Christmas concert.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.320
Yes, all right.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.320
They were more recent.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.360
But you're forgetting

10:51.360 --> 10:54.360
that in a previous,

10:51.360 --> 10:54.360
more pleasant life,

10:54.400 --> 10:58.400
I was one of Lichfield's

10:54.400 --> 10:58.400
finest lawyers, a professional

10:54.400 --> 10:58.400
in the art of persuasion.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.520
Mmm.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.480
What are you going

10:59.560 --> 11:01.480
to persuade me to do?

11:01.520 --> 11:02.480
Hmm.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.160
Well, I can think

11:03.360 --> 11:06.160
of a few things.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.640
Mmm, good.

11:07.680 --> 11:10.000
Well, tell me about

11:07.680 --> 11:10.000
them in the morning.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.600
Lorna, that's not fair,

11:10.040 --> 11:12.600
you started that!

11:12.640 --> 11:14.640
I know.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.640
Sometimes I'm all talk.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.560
-[knocking at door]

11:16.600 --> 11:18.560
-[Nina] Come in.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.560
Ken!

11:21.600 --> 11:22.880
Nina.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.880
-And baby!

11:22.920 --> 11:24.880
-Yes!

11:24.920 --> 11:28.200
Oh, um... Mmm.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.560
[baby cooing]

11:29.600 --> 11:31.640
Uh... Oh! Golly gosh.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.880
[chuckles] Look at your

11:31.680 --> 11:34.880
trousers! Wow!

11:34.920 --> 11:37.680
-Getting a lot of trouble

11:34.920 --> 11:37.680
from bulls? [laughs]

11:34.920 --> 11:37.680
-[laughs]

11:37.720 --> 11:40.240
I don't know yet.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.240
I've been avoiding

11:37.720 --> 11:40.240
the bull farm.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.960
[laughs] Oh, the bull farm!

11:40.280 --> 11:42.960
Please do sit.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.280
-May I? [laughs]

11:43.000 --> 11:45.280
-Yes, please!

11:46.400 --> 11:49.200
Ah, there we go.

11:49.240 --> 11:52.320
So, I haven't seen you

11:49.240 --> 11:52.320
since you ruined

11:49.240 --> 11:52.320
the Christmas Concert.

11:52.360 --> 11:56.480
Oh, Nina, I am so sorry

11:52.360 --> 11:56.480
about that concert.

11:56.520 --> 12:01.600
And of course,

11:56.520 --> 12:01.600
about the punch

11:56.520 --> 12:01.600
and you know, the vomit.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.920
You're forgiven! I'm not

12:01.640 --> 12:04.920
the sort of person

12:01.640 --> 12:04.920
who carries grudges.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.400
Aww.

12:06.440 --> 12:10.080
So, what do you want?

12:06.440 --> 12:10.080
I imagine I will grant it.

12:10.120 --> 12:15.200
Well, Rachel was making

12:10.120 --> 12:15.200
an application for the job

12:10.120 --> 12:15.200
at your charity.

12:15.240 --> 12:17.760
And... it's a funny

12:15.240 --> 12:17.760
story actually.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.200
[both laughing]

12:20.240 --> 12:21.560
Um...

12:21.600 --> 12:23.680
She tried to send it

12:21.600 --> 12:23.680
last night online

12:23.720 --> 12:27.280
and Gordon Bennett,

12:23.720 --> 12:27.280
your website was frozen,

12:23.720 --> 12:27.280
it wouldn't send.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.960
Oh, shame.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.960
So, she missed the deadline.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.360
Yes.

12:31.400 --> 12:35.040
Well, I thought,

12:31.400 --> 12:35.040
never mind, print off

12:31.400 --> 12:35.040
a hard copy

12:35.080 --> 12:36.680
and just bring it in.

12:36.720 --> 12:40.600
Sometimes the old fashioned

12:36.720 --> 12:40.600
ways are the best.

12:40.640 --> 12:44.280
Ken, no, I'm sorry,

12:40.640 --> 12:44.280
I couldn't accept an

12:40.640 --> 12:44.280
application past the deadline.

12:44.320 --> 12:47.120
Oh? Oh, no, she tried

12:44.320 --> 12:47.120
to make the deadline, so...

12:47.160 --> 12:48.640
No, yes, well.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.240
I couldn't give Rachel

12:48.680 --> 12:51.240
special treatment,

12:48.680 --> 12:51.240
you know.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.360
Everyone knows

12:51.280 --> 12:53.360
how close we are.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.880
-Do they?

12:55.200 --> 12:57.880
-Yes, they do, Ken.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.640
No, I'm sorry.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.640
But it would be immoral

12:57.920 --> 13:00.640
of me to read it.

13:00.680 --> 13:04.560
Nina, who would know?

13:06.400 --> 13:07.920
I would know, Ken.

13:09.360 --> 13:12.640
Okay, okay.

13:12.680 --> 13:16.240
Well, it's there

13:12.680 --> 13:16.240
if you change

13:12.680 --> 13:16.240
your mind.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.360
No, I won't.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.280
Pretty sure you will.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.400
I won't, buh-bye.

13:20.440 --> 13:23.080
-Mmm... You might.

13:20.440 --> 13:23.080
-I won't.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.000
Aww.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.160
Ah!

13:30.720 --> 13:32.440
Dad!

13:32.480 --> 13:34.800
Oh, I like those trousers,

13:32.480 --> 13:34.800
Ken, lord, I do.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.160
Of course you do.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.360
-Mind if I buy a similar pair?

13:36.200 --> 13:39.360
-Yes, I mind. Do not.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.400
So? How'd it go?

13:41.440 --> 13:43.200
Bad news,

13:41.440 --> 13:43.200
I'm afraid, love.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.400
Nina was completely

13:43.240 --> 13:45.400
unreasonable.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.840
Oh, well.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.840
Thank you, universe.

13:49.440 --> 13:53.440
Love. Listen,

13:53.480 --> 13:55.480
I probably just

13:53.480 --> 13:55.480
caught her on a bad day.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.560
It'll be all right,

13:55.520 --> 13:58.560
I'll have another word

13:55.520 --> 13:58.560
with her.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.840
Hey listen, how about

13:58.600 --> 14:01.840
I put Sid down

14:01.880 --> 14:04.640
and I go out and get us

14:01.880 --> 14:04.640
a Magnum out of the freezer.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.920
-Uh-huh?

14:04.680 --> 14:06.920
-Cool.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.640
-Ben, do you want one?

14:06.960 --> 14:09.640
-Plain chocolate, please, Ken.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.160
The almond ones

14:09.680 --> 14:11.160
give me hives.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.600
[whistling]

14:33.280 --> 14:34.200
[Dale] Chief Ken!

14:35.520 --> 14:36.320
Hey.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.920
[laughs]

14:38.960 --> 14:40.840
Little something

14:38.960 --> 14:40.840
I'm doing for Rachel.

14:41.520 --> 14:42.360
It's Nina.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.040
What have you done,

14:43.360 --> 14:46.040
you lunatic?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.240
Ah!

14:47.280 --> 14:49.080
It's gonna be a while

14:47.280 --> 14:49.080
before she wakes up,

14:49.120 --> 14:50.760
but when she does,

14:50.800 --> 14:53.320
I reckon she's gonna

14:50.800 --> 14:53.320
consider Rachel for

14:50.800 --> 14:53.320
that job after all.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.400
Please say this

14:55.840 --> 14:57.400
isn't happening.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.360
Oh, bollocks!

15:01.400 --> 15:03.760
-[laughs]

15:01.400 --> 15:03.760
-Dad, don't promise

15:01.400 --> 15:03.760
ice-cream and not--

15:03.800 --> 15:04.680
Shh!

15:08.240 --> 15:11.000
What? Oh, my god,

15:08.240 --> 15:11.000
what's going on?

15:11.040 --> 15:12.600
It's Dale,

15:11.040 --> 15:12.600
he's kidnapped Nina.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.160
-Dale!

15:12.640 --> 15:14.160
-Yeah.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.760
It's a fail-safe

15:14.200 --> 15:16.760
business technique

15:14.200 --> 15:16.760
I learned in China.

15:16.800 --> 15:21.400
Step one, put your intended

15:16.800 --> 15:21.400
business partner in a room

15:16.800 --> 15:21.400
with a bag over their head.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.000
Step two, they'll

15:21.440 --> 15:24.000
pretty much do

15:21.440 --> 15:24.000
anything you want.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.680
[laughing]

15:24.040 --> 15:26.680
Like give you the job

15:24.040 --> 15:26.680
of your dreams.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.240
You kidnapped

15:26.720 --> 15:28.240
Nina for me?

15:28.280 --> 15:30.200
You're welcome, Mom.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.280
Now, we'll get down to

15:30.240 --> 15:33.280
negotiations just as soon as

15:30.240 --> 15:33.280
the chloroform wears off.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.120
-Chloroform?

15:33.320 --> 15:35.120
-Yeah.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.840
Dale, we could go to prison.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.040
Kidnapping is illegal.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.040
Well, not if it's for

15:38.080 --> 15:40.040
business purposes.

15:40.080 --> 15:42.040
Yes, it's still

15:40.080 --> 15:42.040
exactly as illegal!

15:42.080 --> 15:44.400
Pretty sure you're wrong

15:42.080 --> 15:44.400
about that, Chief Ken.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.760
'Cause Mr. Xi he did

15:44.440 --> 15:46.760
kidnappings all the time.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.640
And if that was illegal,

15:46.800 --> 15:49.640
that would make him

15:46.800 --> 15:49.640
a criminal,

15:49.680 --> 15:51.440
which he always

15:49.680 --> 15:51.440
insisted he wasn't.

15:51.480 --> 15:55.400
Dale, you've done

15:51.480 --> 15:55.400
a very bad thing here,

15:51.480 --> 15:55.400
do you understand?

15:55.440 --> 15:57.080
[shouts]

15:55.440 --> 15:57.080
A very, very bad thing.

15:57.120 --> 16:00.200
[Nina]

15:57.120 --> 16:00.200
Oh, Ken? Is that you?

16:00.240 --> 16:04.320
Yes, it was definitely you.

16:00.240 --> 16:04.320
I'd know your voice anywhere.

16:05.640 --> 16:06.440
Oh.

16:08.000 --> 16:08.800
Yes.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.440
Hi.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.280
[Nina] Oh, God!

16:10.480 --> 16:12.280
Where are we?

16:12.320 --> 16:14.280
Ken, have they

16:12.320 --> 16:14.280
kidnapped you too?

16:15.000 --> 16:15.840
Yes.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.360
I've been kidnapped too.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.000
I don't know

16:18.400 --> 16:21.000
by whom or why

16:21.040 --> 16:24.320
but... Oh...

16:21.040 --> 16:24.320
[grunts]

16:24.360 --> 16:26.520
I'm being dragged

16:24.360 --> 16:26.520
away now, Nina!

16:26.560 --> 16:28.320
I'm being dragged now!

16:28.360 --> 16:30.120
-They're dragging me out now.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.120
-Ken!

16:30.160 --> 16:32.320
-[Nina]<i> Ken!</i>

16:30.160 --> 16:32.320
-You're insane, you're insane.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.400
Chief Ken, I've got it

16:32.360 --> 16:34.400
all covered. Look.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.400
[Nina]<i> If you touch</i>

16:34.440 --> 16:36.400
<i>a hair on his head!</i>

16:36.440 --> 16:39.560
It's vital to track

16:36.440 --> 16:39.560
negotiations at all times.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.040
I improvised with

16:39.600 --> 16:42.040
Sid's baby monitor.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.560
How neat is that?

16:43.600 --> 16:46.200
It is very far

16:43.600 --> 16:46.200
from neat.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.760
What the hell

16:46.240 --> 16:47.760
are we gonna do?

16:47.800 --> 16:50.440
Dale, what sort of business

16:47.800 --> 16:50.440
did Mr. Xi run, exactly?

16:50.480 --> 16:54.680
Oh, all sorts. Clubs,

16:50.480 --> 16:54.680
casinos, security services

16:50.480 --> 16:54.680
to local businesses.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.240
[Ken] Oh, my god.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.560
And he shipped

16:56.280 --> 16:58.560
a hell of a lot

16:56.280 --> 16:58.560
of poppy extracts. [laughs]

16:58.600 --> 17:01.720
Dale, I think Mr. Xi

16:58.600 --> 17:01.720
may have been a gangster.

17:01.760 --> 17:05.560
Right. And I suppose

17:01.760 --> 17:05.560
Chun Pat was a gangster

17:01.760 --> 17:05.560
too, and Sen Yi.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.160
And all my

17:05.600 --> 17:07.160
fun Triad buddies.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.080
-[Rachel gasps]

17:07.200 --> 17:09.080
-You are shitting me.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.200
I'm not shitting you.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.240
Ken. Addendum RE,

17:10.240 --> 17:12.240
the chocolate ices.

17:12.280 --> 17:16.120
Almonds ones are still a no go,

17:12.280 --> 17:16.120
but I'd say a big yes,

17:12.280 --> 17:16.120
to one of the minty ones.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.880
Ben, shut up!

17:17.920 --> 17:20.200
Dale's kidnapped Nina,

17:17.920 --> 17:20.200
she's tied up

17:17.920 --> 17:20.200
and drugged in our garage.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.080
[laughing]

17:22.120 --> 17:23.520
Oh, you got me.

17:23.560 --> 17:28.400
[Nina]<i> Help! Tell my children</i>

17:23.560 --> 17:28.400
<i>I love them!</i> [sobbing]

17:28.440 --> 17:30.000
Oh, my God,

17:28.440 --> 17:30.000
this is a crime!

17:30.680 --> 17:31.840
I'm implicated.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.960
The Law Society

17:31.880 --> 17:33.960
will be furious!

17:34.000 --> 17:35.640
-I need to get

17:34.000 --> 17:35.640
out of here.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.640
-Ben.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.560
-Stay.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.560
-Okay, I'll stay.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.800
We need to come up

17:37.600 --> 17:39.800
with a plan here, people.

17:39.840 --> 17:43.600
Gosh, Chief Ken.

17:39.840 --> 17:43.600
If you're so worried about it,

17:39.840 --> 17:43.600
I can just take Nina back.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.480
Nina thinks I've

17:43.640 --> 17:45.480
been kidnapped too.

17:45.520 --> 17:49.120
If you take her back,

17:45.520 --> 17:49.120
the first person the police

17:45.520 --> 17:49.120
will investigate is me.

17:49.160 --> 17:52.040
For what? It's not like

17:49.160 --> 17:52.040
we're doing anything

17:49.160 --> 17:52.040
illegal, guys.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.360
It is illegal!

17:53.400 --> 17:56.040
-[Dylan] All right, losers.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.040
-[Nina]<i> Help! Help!</i>

17:56.080 --> 17:57.520
Dale kidnapped

17:56.080 --> 17:57.520
Nina for me.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.880
That's extreme. Cool.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.880
Right, well I'll be in my room.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.520
Get back here!

18:03.560 --> 18:06.160
We need to decide

18:03.560 --> 18:06.160
what to do here otherwise

18:03.560 --> 18:06.160
Dale is going to prison,

18:06.200 --> 18:08.400
and Ben and I

18:06.200 --> 18:08.400
are gonna lose

18:06.200 --> 18:08.400
our livelihoods.

18:08.440 --> 18:11.040
Imagine not being a lawyer.

18:08.440 --> 18:11.040
I can't. I really can't.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.120
[doorbell ringing]

18:14.360 --> 18:15.240
[all gasp]

18:18.000 --> 18:19.560
Ah!

18:19.600 --> 18:21.040
It's you.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.040
What do you want?

18:21.080 --> 18:22.920
Just being

18:21.080 --> 18:22.920
a friendly neighbor, Ken.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.200
Uh, we've had

18:22.960 --> 18:25.200
some complaints.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.680
A woman was heard wailing.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.560
Clearly audible from

18:27.720 --> 18:30.560
behind those bushes

18:27.720 --> 18:30.560
over there.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.520
And who was listening

18:30.600 --> 18:32.520
from the bushes?

18:32.560 --> 18:35.720
I can't divulge my sources.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.720
Seriously, Ken,

18:35.760 --> 18:38.560
what's happening?

18:35.760 --> 18:38.560
Is it Lorna?

18:38.600 --> 18:40.320
[Nina]<i> Untie me from</i>

18:38.600 --> 18:40.320
<i>this chair!</i>

18:40.360 --> 18:41.800
-Yes.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.800
-Say no more.

18:41.840 --> 18:44.160
Bit of Fifty Shades

18:41.840 --> 18:44.160
in the garage, huh?

18:44.200 --> 18:48.280
Nothing could be

18:44.200 --> 18:48.280
more natural or beautiful.

18:44.200 --> 18:48.280
Can I--

18:48.320 --> 18:49.800
-No.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.800
-I didn't finish.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.520
-You were going to

18:49.840 --> 18:52.520
ask if you could watch.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.520
-I was. Can I?

18:52.560 --> 18:56.080
[Nina]<i> You won't get away</i>

18:52.560 --> 18:56.080
<i>with this! You mark my words!</i>

18:56.120 --> 18:58.000
<i>You won't</i>

18:56.120 --> 18:58.000
<i>get away with this!</i>

18:58.040 --> 18:59.240
We have to shut her up.

18:59.280 --> 19:02.000
[Nina screaming]

19:02.040 --> 19:03.240
[gasps]

19:04.400 --> 19:06.000
Oh, Ken! Thank God!

19:06.040 --> 19:07.800
Oh, Ken, what did

19:06.040 --> 19:07.800
they do to you?

19:07.840 --> 19:09.680
[Rachel]

19:07.840 --> 19:09.680
Hey! Be quiet there, mate!

19:09.720 --> 19:11.280
You bloody stay there.

19:11.320 --> 19:15.120
Otherwise I'll put you

19:11.320 --> 19:15.120
on the barbie, you cactus.

19:15.160 --> 19:18.400
Okay one of them's Australian,

19:15.160 --> 19:18.400
and the other I just have

19:15.160 --> 19:18.400
no idea!

19:18.440 --> 19:19.280
Hmm.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.920
-Where are we?

19:20.360 --> 19:22.920
-It's impossible to say.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.960
Stop complaining,

19:22.960 --> 19:25.960
you pommy bastard!

19:26.000 --> 19:30.320
Or I'll put you

19:26.000 --> 19:30.320
on the barbie, you cactus.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.320
Okay Ken,

19:30.360 --> 19:33.320
look, just don't

19:30.360 --> 19:33.320
provoke him, okay?

19:33.360 --> 19:36.120
Please, what do you

19:33.360 --> 19:36.120
want from us?

19:38.560 --> 19:39.760
Why are we here?

19:43.120 --> 19:45.440
You must have

19:43.120 --> 19:45.440
taken us hostage

19:43.120 --> 19:45.440
for a reason.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.560
Okay. This is the way

19:49.880 --> 19:51.560
I see it.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.320
Me and my very good friend

19:51.600 --> 19:54.320
Nina here are trapped.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.280
So, why don't you go

19:54.360 --> 19:57.280
and talk among yourselves,

19:57.320 --> 20:00.280
and decide on how

19:57.320 --> 20:00.280
we can resolve this

19:57.320 --> 20:00.280
situation? Yeah?

20:00.320 --> 20:01.880
Oh. Good plan, Ken.

20:01.920 --> 20:05.560
No, I mean bonza!

20:10.720 --> 20:12.480
Jeepers, Ken.

20:12.520 --> 20:15.160
I don't know how you

20:12.520 --> 20:15.160
remain so brave

20:12.520 --> 20:15.160
and masterful?

20:15.200 --> 20:17.640
I mean that was

20:15.200 --> 20:17.640
like you were

20:15.200 --> 20:17.640
giving them orders.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.560
Nina you can't

20:17.680 --> 20:19.560
show them any fear.

20:19.600 --> 20:23.200
That is the first rule

20:19.600 --> 20:23.200
of being kidnapped by

20:19.600 --> 20:23.200
enigmatic terrorist vigilantes.

20:23.240 --> 20:27.320
They've left us alone now

20:23.240 --> 20:27.320
and that was their first

20:23.240 --> 20:27.320
mistake 'cause we can talk.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.840
Right, so, I would say...

20:30.880 --> 20:34.200
I think we're in

20:30.880 --> 20:34.200
the garage

20:30.880 --> 20:34.200
of a suburban house.

20:34.240 --> 20:37.120
Or a lock-up. Or a bunker.

20:34.240 --> 20:37.120
Let's not jump to conclusions.

20:37.160 --> 20:41.080
Umm... unlikely. I mean,

20:37.160 --> 20:41.080
look there's a Ripper

20:37.160 --> 20:41.080
Skateboard there.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.880
My Neil's' got

20:41.120 --> 20:42.880
one of those.

20:42.920 --> 20:47.600
No, my guess

20:42.920 --> 20:47.600
would be we're

20:42.920 --> 20:47.600
in a family home,

20:47.640 --> 20:50.200
where there's a son

20:47.640 --> 20:50.200
about Neil's age.

20:50.240 --> 20:53.760
Stop guessing, Nina.

20:50.240 --> 20:53.760
Okay? It's a trap!

20:53.800 --> 20:57.840
Everything in here is designed

20:53.800 --> 20:57.840
to make us think the things

20:53.800 --> 20:57.840
they want us to think.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.480
Believe nothing.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.480
Trust no one.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.800
[groans]

21:04.960 --> 21:06.040
[sighs]

21:06.080 --> 21:08.040
Okay. So far,

21:06.080 --> 21:08.040
we have three ideas.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.320
Number one,

21:08.080 --> 21:10.320
convince Nina

21:08.080 --> 21:10.320
this is all a dream.

21:10.360 --> 21:14.080
-That one's my favorite.

21:10.360 --> 21:14.080
-Number two,

21:10.360 --> 21:14.080
something about fridges.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.040
Yeah, no, that never

21:14.120 --> 21:16.040
really developed.

21:16.080 --> 21:19.880
Uh, number three,

21:16.080 --> 21:19.880
kill ourselves and frame her

21:16.080 --> 21:19.880
for the murder. Thanks, Dylan.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.720
It's not all mine.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.720
I saw it on<i> CSI.</i>

21:21.760 --> 21:22.920
Oh, sorry. Laters.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.360
Dylan, Where

21:22.960 --> 21:24.360
are you going?

21:24.400 --> 21:26.200
Seeing Zoe.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.200
Got nine shags to go.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.560
So, I have an idea.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.560
But you're not

21:27.800 --> 21:30.560
going to like it.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.720
-Oh, no, go on then!

21:30.600 --> 21:32.720
-What if...

21:32.760 --> 21:36.280
we hand Dale into the police?

21:32.760 --> 21:36.280
And he takes the rap

21:32.760 --> 21:36.280
for everything?

21:37.120 --> 21:38.480
[chuckling]

21:38.520 --> 21:40.640
Wow! That's a great idea!

21:40.680 --> 21:42.840
I knew there was

21:40.680 --> 21:42.840
a way out,

21:40.680 --> 21:42.840
you brainy box.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.800
Good job, buddy.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.800
I'll just go to jail.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.080
How long

21:44.840 --> 21:46.080
will I be there?

21:46.120 --> 21:47.480
Five-ten years.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.240
Pfft! I'll be out before

21:47.520 --> 21:50.240
you can say lickety-split.

21:50.280 --> 21:52.960
Dale, you do not

21:50.280 --> 21:52.960
want to go to jail.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.240
You know what happens

21:53.000 --> 21:56.240
to athletic young men in jail?

21:56.280 --> 21:57.840
Are they made

21:56.280 --> 21:57.840
to do gymnastics?

21:57.880 --> 21:59.320
Because I love gymnastics!

21:59.360 --> 22:00.800
So, it's sorted then, right.

22:00.840 --> 22:02.920
So Dale, when you

22:00.840 --> 22:02.920
give yourself up

22:02.960 --> 22:07.080
make sure that you say

22:02.960 --> 22:07.080
that you take absolutely all

22:02.960 --> 22:07.080
the blame for everything. Okay?

22:07.120 --> 22:09.280
No, stop. Okay.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.280
There has to be

22:07.120 --> 22:09.280
another way.

22:09.320 --> 22:13.680
Dale is fine with it.

22:09.320 --> 22:13.680
Okay, now I'm just going

22:09.320 --> 22:13.680
to make a little call.

22:14.920 --> 22:18.040
Rachel, I know it's hard,

22:18.080 --> 22:21.600
but you'll thank me

22:18.080 --> 22:21.600
when Dale is in jail,

22:21.640 --> 22:23.880
and we're not in jail. Okay.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.440
Quick, stop him!

22:23.920 --> 22:26.440
Quick, Dale!

22:27.120 --> 22:28.680
[muffled voice]

22:28.720 --> 22:31.160
Ben. I know this is tough.

22:28.720 --> 22:31.160
But you do understand,

22:28.720 --> 22:31.160
don't you?

22:31.200 --> 22:32.840
-[muffled voice]

22:31.200 --> 22:32.840
-Yeah.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.240
Sorry, buddy.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.240
Had to do it.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.560
[grunting]

22:39.600 --> 22:41.600
[baby crying]

22:41.640 --> 22:43.360
Why is that

22:41.640 --> 22:43.360
baby crying? [panting]

22:43.400 --> 22:44.720
What are they

22:43.400 --> 22:44.720
doing to it?

22:44.760 --> 22:46.760
[shouts] What are you

22:44.760 --> 22:46.760
doing to the baby?

22:46.800 --> 22:50.720
It's probably nothing.

22:46.800 --> 22:50.720
We just need to be quiet

22:46.800 --> 22:50.720
and maybe...

22:50.760 --> 22:54.120
in our hearts, start

22:50.760 --> 22:54.120
to think about

22:50.760 --> 22:54.120
forgiving our captors.

22:54.160 --> 22:55.960
This could be

22:54.160 --> 22:55.960
the end, Ken.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.400
I'd like to thank you

22:56.000 --> 22:58.400
for being here with me.

22:59.520 --> 23:00.840
I mean I had no choice.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.160
No, no...

23:02.200 --> 23:05.520
[Nina]

23:02.200 --> 23:05.520
<i>You have been wonderful.</i>

23:05.560 --> 23:10.120
<i>In fact. I've got</i>

23:05.560 --> 23:10.120
<i>a confession to make.</i>

23:05.560 --> 23:10.120
<i>It's about Rachel.</i>

23:10.160 --> 23:12.960
I didn't mind that Rachel

23:10.160 --> 23:12.960
got her application in late.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.960
Oh! Well that's,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.960
that's excellent news.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.400
No, no, to be honest,

23:18.440 --> 23:20.720
<i>she just wasn't</i>

23:18.440 --> 23:20.720
<i>really good enough</i>

23:18.440 --> 23:20.720
<i>for the job.</i>

23:20.760 --> 23:23.360
<i>You know, this is a very</i>

23:20.760 --> 23:23.360
<i>prestigious position,</i>

23:23.400 --> 23:25.600
you know, we were

23:23.400 --> 23:25.600
looking for go getters.

23:25.640 --> 23:30.800
And Rachel skipped university

23:25.640 --> 23:30.800
and hasn't really done much

23:25.640 --> 23:30.800
but sit on her arse ever since.

23:30.840 --> 23:34.200
<i>You know, we were</i>

23:30.840 --> 23:34.200
<i>hoping for a certain</i>

23:30.840 --> 23:34.200
<i>standard of applicant</i>

23:34.240 --> 23:36.800
[laughing] and she is

23:34.240 --> 23:36.800
very far off it.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.480
[takes a deep breath] Ah!

23:41.320 --> 23:44.240
Yeah. Yeah, must be nice

23:41.320 --> 23:44.240
to get that out in the open.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.280
Oh, wow.

23:51.600 --> 23:52.960
I'm so sorry, Rach.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.680
No, it's okay.

23:55.720 --> 24:00.080
God, look at us. You thinking

23:55.720 --> 24:00.080
you were a businessman,

24:00.120 --> 24:05.240
and... me thinking I had

24:00.120 --> 24:05.240
any kind of future when

24:00.120 --> 24:05.240
it's already past rescuing.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.360
Couple of idiots.

24:14.520 --> 24:18.720
Oh, look, that must've come out

24:14.520 --> 24:18.720
of the bag the kidnappers

24:14.520 --> 24:18.720
put on my head.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.960
A receipt? Oh,

24:18.760 --> 24:20.960
I wouldn't bother with that.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.160
No! It's fine I can

24:21.000 --> 24:24.160
read it from here.

24:24.200 --> 24:29.680
"One pair of cherry

24:24.200 --> 24:29.680
red trousers,

24:24.200 --> 24:29.680
44 inch waist."

24:29.720 --> 24:32.680
Yeah. Well, that

24:29.720 --> 24:32.680
is quite interesting.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.600
That sounds

24:32.720 --> 24:34.600
like your trousers.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.800
What trousers?

24:35.840 --> 24:37.200
The ones you're wearing.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.120
Well, that's...

24:39.160 --> 24:41.480
Odd that the kidnappers

24:39.160 --> 24:41.480
would use your shopping bag.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.840
Unless we were

24:42.400 --> 24:43.840
in your house.

24:46.480 --> 24:49.600
Ken, I think

24:46.480 --> 24:49.600
this is your garage.

24:49.640 --> 24:52.400
[laughs] Nina.

24:49.640 --> 24:52.400
This is not my garage.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.320
Ken, what is going on?

24:55.360 --> 24:59.680
Nina, this is not my garage.

24:59.720 --> 25:02.840
This is not

24:59.720 --> 25:02.840
my bloody garage, Nina!

25:02.880 --> 25:03.880
I swear.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.160
[garage door opens]

25:17.600 --> 25:19.000
Ken, it's Lorna!

25:19.040 --> 25:21.400
What are you doing

25:19.040 --> 25:21.400
tied up there,

25:19.040 --> 25:21.400
you drongbats?

25:21.440 --> 25:24.200
Ken, this is your garage!

25:21.440 --> 25:24.200
You kidnapped me!

25:25.920 --> 25:29.200
Wrong, Nina.

25:25.920 --> 25:29.200
Really wrong.

25:29.240 --> 25:30.040
Rachel?

25:31.280 --> 25:34.680
Yeah. Nina, maybe

25:31.280 --> 25:34.680
my CV is rubbish.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.600
But you said

25:34.720 --> 25:36.600
I'm not a go-getter.

25:36.640 --> 25:39.640
Well, how go-getting is this?

25:36.640 --> 25:39.640
I kidnapped you.

25:39.680 --> 25:42.080
-What?

25:39.680 --> 25:42.080
-I had to get your

25:39.680 --> 25:42.080
attention somehow.

25:42.120 --> 25:46.360
And if taking you hostage

25:42.120 --> 25:46.360
is what it takes for you

25:42.120 --> 25:46.360
to consider my application,

25:46.400 --> 25:48.280
well, yeah, I don't regret it.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.360
Rachel, kidnapping is a crime.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.840
Yes! Kidnapping is a crime.

25:53.880 --> 25:58.280
It's happening to women

25:53.880 --> 25:58.280
and children in North Korea,

25:58.320 --> 26:02.200
Nepal, uh... Somalia.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.600
-Haiti.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.680
And we should be

26:03.640 --> 26:05.680
fighting it.

26:05.720 --> 26:09.200
Because sometimes

26:05.720 --> 26:09.200
to fight a crime,

26:09.240 --> 26:11.480
you've got to commit

26:09.240 --> 26:11.480
a crime yourself.

26:11.520 --> 26:14.320
[laughs] Yes.

26:11.520 --> 26:14.320
That is a beautiful thought.

26:15.320 --> 26:17.440
Give me that job.

26:15.320 --> 26:17.440
Or bloody hell,

26:17.480 --> 26:20.080
I'll just have to keep

26:17.480 --> 26:20.080
kidnapping you until you do.

26:20.120 --> 26:24.240
Okay, Rachel,

26:20.120 --> 26:24.240
I'm having a hard time

26:20.120 --> 26:24.240
processing your logic.

26:24.280 --> 26:25.480
Yeah, I get that.

26:25.520 --> 26:26.480
But, umm...

26:28.280 --> 26:29.120
I loved it.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.640
[laughs]

26:31.680 --> 26:35.360
I think that is the bravest

26:31.680 --> 26:35.360
job request I've ever had.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.840
You've got the job.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.840
[laughing]

26:38.880 --> 26:40.040
Hell yeah!

26:40.080 --> 26:42.080
[all laughing]

26:42.120 --> 26:45.520
Yes! Wow! Ken, I bet you

26:42.120 --> 26:45.520
were in on this all along,

26:42.120 --> 26:45.520
weren't you?

26:45.560 --> 26:47.440
-Well, I might have been.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.440
-[laughing]

26:47.480 --> 26:49.040
I definitely was. [laughs]

26:49.080 --> 26:51.080
-Untie me now.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.080
-[Nina] Do you know what.

26:51.120 --> 26:54.200
I always thought of you

26:51.120 --> 26:54.200
were more of a comedian

26:51.120 --> 26:54.200
than an actor,

26:54.240 --> 26:57.240
but you're both! Yeah.

26:54.240 --> 26:57.240
Group hug! Group hug!

26:57.280 --> 26:58.560
-Yeah!

26:57.280 --> 26:58.560
-Come on!

26:58.600 --> 26:59.520
[Nina] Aww.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.720
I told you it would

27:00.960 --> 27:02.720
work, Chief Ken.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.440
Wow.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.800
So, I spent six months

27:08.480 --> 27:10.800
furthering the interests

27:10.840 --> 27:13.560
of an international

27:10.840 --> 27:13.560
criminal organization.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.240
Yeah.

27:15.280 --> 27:19.000
God, must make you rethink

27:15.280 --> 27:19.000
your whole China experience, eh.

27:19.040 --> 27:23.480
Everything you did.

27:19.040 --> 27:23.480
Everyone you met.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.480
Yeah. Well,

27:23.520 --> 27:25.480
except for Ling.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.560
I remain as in love

27:25.520 --> 27:27.560
with her as ever.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.520
Hello, you two.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.680
Hey, Chief Ken.

27:30.720 --> 27:33.040
I've been doing

27:30.720 --> 27:33.040
some research.

27:33.080 --> 27:35.480
Turns out you were

27:33.080 --> 27:35.480
right about

27:33.080 --> 27:35.480
that triads thing.

27:35.520 --> 27:36.720
Uh...

27:36.760 --> 27:38.120
I was fairly sure.

27:38.680 --> 27:39.760
Such a shame.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.640
I will miss having

27:39.800 --> 27:41.640
a vocation in life.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.720
Dale.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.920
-Ken and I have had a chat.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.920
-Thing is,

27:46.960 --> 27:49.160
I could do with some

27:46.960 --> 27:49.160
help looking after Sid.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.360
And you can't be

27:49.200 --> 27:51.360
trusted on your own, so...

27:51.400 --> 27:53.880
So we thought how do you

27:51.400 --> 27:53.880
fancy being Sid's nanny?

27:53.920 --> 27:55.240
-Aww.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.240
-A nanny?

27:55.280 --> 27:56.960
-Is that a real job?

27:55.280 --> 27:56.960
-Sure it is.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.760
You'd live with me and Lorn

27:57.000 --> 27:59.760
just like you're doing now.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.920
And you'd help me

27:59.800 --> 28:02.920
take care of my

27:59.800 --> 28:02.920
darling heir and shit-factory.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.400
[laughing] Wow!

28:04.440 --> 28:06.560
That's amazing!

28:04.440 --> 28:06.560
How much would I earn?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.360
Fifty quid a week.

28:09.400 --> 28:10.440
Fifty quids a week?

28:12.000 --> 28:15.680
No way! I'm rich beyond

28:12.000 --> 28:15.680
my wildest dreams!

28:15.720 --> 28:16.840
[baby crying]

28:16.880 --> 28:18.520
There you go,

28:16.880 --> 28:18.520
you can start now.

28:18.560 --> 28:19.800
Roger that, Chief.

28:20.720 --> 28:22.160
Oh, Dale,

28:22.200 --> 28:25.160
you can do the night shift

28:22.200 --> 28:25.160
as well. I'll get some kip.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.440
I'll stay up all night.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.560
This is gonna be

28:27.880 --> 28:29.560
like a sleep-over

28:29.600 --> 28:32.720
except I'm totally alone.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.720
[laughs] Good night, guys.

28:33.440 --> 28:35.920
[laughs]

28:33.440 --> 28:35.920
Dad. Fifty quid?

28:35.960 --> 28:37.960
-Yeah, you are a tight stink.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.960
-Mmm.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.560
Shit! Did anyone

28:39.440 --> 28:41.560
untie Ben?

28:41.600 --> 28:44.040
