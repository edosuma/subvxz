01:17.500 --> 01:18.500
Oh, shit.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.166
Let's go, quick.

01:26.208 --> 01:28.583
This is private property!

01:32.916 --> 01:34.708
Okay, I gotta go.
Okay...

01:34.916 --> 01:35.833
I gotta go.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.333
Ruth!

03:32.875 --> 03:35.041
I'm pumping gas and this guy
pulls in with his truck

03:35.250 --> 03:37.041
and blocks the pumps.
Okay.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.208
He says he's interested
in the boat and trailer.

03:39.416 --> 03:40.916
What did I want for it?

03:41.125 --> 03:42.541
You tell him it's not for sale.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.333
That's what I told him.
Okay.

03:44.541 --> 03:46.500
He starts peeling money
off this roll of bills,

03:46.708 --> 03:48.958
I say, 'C' Mon, man, put
the money back in your pants,

03:49.125 --> 03:50.708
'It's not for sale.'

03:50.916 --> 03:52.583
Then Stu comes out.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.916
'What are you doing,
you're blocking my pump.'

03:56.125 --> 03:58.458
The guy says he's there
doing business with me.

03:58.666 --> 04:00.125
But he's not
doing business with you.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.000
I know.

04:02.083 --> 04:03.291
The guy whose gas
I had been pumping

04:03.500 --> 04:04.625
gets pissed off.

04:04.833 --> 04:07.041
He steps out of his car,
I swear to god,

04:07.250 --> 04:08.916
he shoves a gun
in this guy's balls.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.000
Get the fuck out of here,
what did you do?

04:12.208 --> 04:13.875
The guy took off,
I didn't want to be there.

04:14.083 --> 04:15.500
I went in the shop,
I grabbed a forty,

04:15.708 --> 04:16.916
I popped it out back,

04:17.125 --> 04:18.750
I tried to just cool down,

04:18.958 --> 04:21.666
which would have been fine,
except then Stu comes out,

04:21.875 --> 04:24.916
he starts complaining about me
like it's all my fault.

04:25.125 --> 04:27.041
One thing leads to another.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.500
We get into a fight.

04:28.708 --> 04:30.708
You got into a fight with Stu?

04:30.875 --> 04:31.666
Yeah.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.750
Asshole! You don't get in
a fight with your boss.

04:34.958 --> 04:37.833
Yeah, well,
he's not my boss anymore.

04:38.541 --> 04:39.416
At some point, apparently,

04:40.750 --> 04:42.000
I grabbed his car keys,
and tried to run him over.

04:42.208 --> 04:44.166
Jesus, Jonny, come on.
Yeah.

04:45.041 --> 04:48.041
He's fine, I hit
the coke machine, but...

04:48.541 --> 04:50.333
I gotta find another job.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.875
You know, I might
have something for you.

04:53.083 --> 04:54.166
Yeah, where?

04:55.791 --> 04:57.541
A guy who lives in the building
I work at, he owns a night club.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.500
He asked me if I knew any people
looking for work.

04:59.708 --> 05:02.916
I don't know about the job,
but you gotta be friendly.

05:06.458 --> 05:07.833
I'm friendly.

05:08.291 --> 05:10.291
Yeah, you're a friendly guy.

05:20.208 --> 05:21.666
It's been a long night, ma'am,

05:21.875 --> 05:23.458
A few drinks,
you forgot what you wore.

05:23.666 --> 05:25.958
It happens all the time.
What's that supposed to mean?

05:26.166 --> 05:29.083
This is the coat
that matches your claim check.

05:29.291 --> 05:30.500
It's not the right coat.

05:30.708 --> 05:31.833
It's the only coat
I have for you.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.875
This coat's from Talbot's.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.625
Do I look like I came in
wearing a blazer?

05:36.833 --> 05:38.416
Steph, look at this.
Hey, babe.

05:38.625 --> 05:39.125
Yeah.

05:40.208 --> 05:41.458
Was I wearing a blazer
from Talbot's?

05:41.666 --> 05:42.750
I dunno.

05:44.083 --> 05:45.750
Was I wearing a blazer
in the cab?

05:45.958 --> 05:47.375
I think so.

05:48.375 --> 05:50.083
Just take it.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.000
Thank you.

05:53.291 --> 05:55.500
Look man, I'm sorry,
she can be a little rude.

05:55.666 --> 05:57.125
That's alright,
I'm used to it...

05:57.333 --> 05:59.500
You used to
stealing people's shit?

06:00.583 --> 06:02.208
Leave your number here,
if I find something...

06:02.416 --> 06:03.708
I think it had feathers on it.

06:03.916 --> 06:06.500
Whatever it was,
I'm sure it's very nice.

06:11.416 --> 06:13.416
For all your hard work.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.541
Miss Duffy, did you see
the paper today?

07:44.750 --> 07:45.375
No, why?

07:46.208 --> 07:46.583
Antoinette was interviewed.

07:47.833 --> 07:48.291
Did you know The Times
was doing a piece

07:49.166 --> 07:49.708
on private school admissions?

07:50.750 --> 07:51.208
Not only us,
but we look the worst.

07:51.916 --> 07:52.500
Thanks to Antoinette.

07:53.541 --> 07:54.500
What did she say?
She said...

07:54.708 --> 07:56.375
'Not everyone
can afford to donate

07:56.583 --> 07:58.625
'a helicopter trip to Nantucket.

07:58.791 --> 08:00.583
'But those families who
can't come up with something

08:00.791 --> 08:02.666
persuasive for the Auction

08:02.875 --> 08:05.958
'should not be sending
their daughters to this school.'

08:06.166 --> 08:08.541
That is the Head
of Admissions talking!

08:08.750 --> 08:10.291
Who donated that?

08:10.625 --> 08:11.625
It doesn't matter.

08:11.833 --> 08:14.000
I'm looking for her replacement.

08:25.041 --> 08:26.250
Good morning.

08:27.166 --> 08:28.625
The new brochures are here,

08:28.833 --> 08:30.833
just in time
for the board meeting.

08:31.291 --> 08:33.166
I broke my heel.
Now?

08:33.375 --> 08:35.625
I know.
Don't you have an extra pair?

08:35.832 --> 08:39.332
Oh no, I always keep
spare shoes in the office.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.957
Can I see them?
What size are you?

08:42.166 --> 08:44.583
An 8.
Sorry, mine are 9 1/2.

08:44.791 --> 08:45.541
Can I try them?

08:46.833 --> 08:49.125
I didn't schedule
anything else until 10:45.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.708
That's Volunteer Training
for Parents.

08:52.291 --> 08:53.583
Spend a few minutes with them,
let them ask you some questions.

08:53.791 --> 08:55.416
Then there's a 6-pack at 11.

08:55.625 --> 08:57.916
A translator's booked
for the 4-pack at noon.

08:58.125 --> 09:01.625
The 1:00 tour is a VIP.
It's the father, he's an artist.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.666
I put a book of his work
in your desk.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.541
It's pretty nasty,
you should look.

09:05.750 --> 09:08.375
He doesn't want a private tour,
but he needs to be acknowledged,

09:08.583 --> 09:10.416
without seeming
to be acknowledged.

09:10.625 --> 09:11.875
Apparently we want the kid.

09:13.208 --> 09:14.958
Okay, can we get started?

09:15.166 --> 09:17.291
We have a lot to cover,
and I have a flight to catch.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.625
I move we skip the minutes
from our last meeting in June.

09:20.833 --> 09:21.916
Second that.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.333
So moved.
Great.

09:23.541 --> 09:25.166
Okay, why don't we...?

09:25.666 --> 09:27.500
Why don't we start
with admissions?

09:27.708 --> 09:30.583
Okay, so we have
a lot to report...

09:30.916 --> 09:33.708
Despite the changes in staff,
of which you are well aware,

09:33.916 --> 09:36.458
our numbers are
higher than ever this year.

09:36.666 --> 09:38.333
Do you want to begin
by distributing

09:38.541 --> 09:40.250
the new brochures
to the Trustees?

09:40.458 --> 09:43.166
Once again, we have
vastly more applicants

09:43.375 --> 09:45.000
than we could ever accept.

09:45.208 --> 09:46.833
Ruth has worked
tirelessly this summer

09:47.041 --> 09:48.541
to complete this project.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.666
She's our Interim
Head of Admissions.

09:51.916 --> 09:54.250
Miss Duffy is holding down
the fort while we search

09:54.458 --> 09:56.541
for a replacement
for Antoinette.

09:58.791 --> 10:00.416
Has everybody had a minute
to look at that

10:00.625 --> 10:02.166
because I have a comment.

10:02.375 --> 10:03.833
Excellent work, Miss Duffy,

10:04.000 --> 10:05.791
but what has everybody
noticed about it?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.375
They're all girls!

10:08.958 --> 10:09.875
I give up.

10:10.166 --> 10:12.083
Every face is white.

10:12.541 --> 10:15.375
We have other girls
in this school, Miss Duffy.

10:15.583 --> 10:18.250
Have they been excluded
from the brochure?

10:18.458 --> 10:19.958
What about these two?

10:20.166 --> 10:21.125
They look like they're Spanish.

10:22.666 --> 10:24.708
Claire and Lily Tommasino,
Albert Tommasino's daughters.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.208
He's the head
of the finance committee.

10:26.416 --> 10:28.333
And not Spanish.
Lemme...

10:28.583 --> 10:30.541
Let me remind you
the need-based packages

10:30.750 --> 10:33.208
do not start until
after 9th Grade.

10:33.416 --> 10:36.916
This not who we're targeting.
We're looking at Lower School.

10:37.125 --> 10:40.333
We've had this discussion
before, this is not about race.

10:40.583 --> 10:41.833
It's partly race.

10:42.083 --> 10:43.500
No, it's just dollars and cents.

10:43.708 --> 10:46.083
Guy, why would we want
to market ourselves

10:46.250 --> 10:48.416
to families who need tuition
assistance in kindergarden?

10:48.625 --> 10:49.958
I don't care
what color they are,

10:50.166 --> 10:52.041
it's a big financial
commitment for us.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.166
Miss Duffy, how many applicants
have we had

10:54.375 --> 10:55.458
for kindergarten this year?

10:55.708 --> 10:56.666
Almost 100 already.

10:57.916 --> 10:59.791
And how many of those
are families of color?

11:00.541 --> 11:02.125
I can think of two.

11:02.333 --> 11:03.875
But I'm sure there'll be more.

11:04.083 --> 11:05.750
Alison Bayard-Lowell.

11:05.958 --> 11:08.666
She's turning five in January.
Her parents are both economists.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.166
Her father's William Lowell.

11:10.375 --> 11:11.208
Who else?

11:12.250 --> 11:13.708
Parker Ann Hahman.
She's also four.

11:13.916 --> 11:15.625
Her father's an Egyptian tenor
at the Met,

11:15.833 --> 11:17.333
and her mother went to Dalton.

11:18.625 --> 11:20.000
They both sound good to me.

11:20.208 --> 11:22.250
Let's try to get them.
Is two enough?

11:24.375 --> 11:25.666
Can we help you, Ms. Spradlin?

11:27.250 --> 11:28.250
I'm sorry, Mr. Brinckerhoff.
There was a phone call for Ruth.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.166
Is everything alright?

11:50.041 --> 11:52.125
Hey.
Hey.

11:54.125 --> 11:55.208
We're gonna go say hi.

11:55.416 --> 11:57.375
I'm gonna go get a drink with...

12:00.125 --> 12:00.833
Hi!

12:01.041 --> 12:02.291
Who's that?

12:02.500 --> 12:03.291
Who's that?

12:04.541 --> 12:05.125
I'm gonna get a beer,
do you want something?

12:05.333 --> 12:06.333
I want a white wine.

12:06.541 --> 12:07.916
Meet you outside.

12:08.750 --> 12:09.958
Hey, Jonny...

12:10.791 --> 12:12.666
How you doin'?
Yuch...

12:13.041 --> 12:14.791
I don't know, man.

12:23.583 --> 12:24.375
Come on.

12:25.750 --> 12:26.625
Go say something.
I'll come back in a minute.

12:26.833 --> 12:27.708
Okay.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.625
It's no big deal. Just say
you're sorry for her loss.

12:32.125 --> 12:33.958
Yeah, I will, I will.

12:39.666 --> 12:40.583
Hey.

12:41.833 --> 12:44.208
What happened to Val?
He's still inside.

12:44.541 --> 12:46.416
Hey Bobby!
How you doin'?

12:48.583 --> 12:49.833
Look at you.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.458
What's wrong with it?

12:53.166 --> 12:53.958
It's a little fuckin' sexy for
the occasion, don't you think?

12:54.166 --> 12:55.250
Hey!
What?

12:56.625 --> 12:57.916
Jonny just got it for me.
He doesn't care.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.833
I don't care,
you look like a loopa,

13:00.041 --> 13:01.875
and it's out of
Jonny's price range.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.833
You look gorgeous,
don't listen to him.

13:04.041 --> 13:05.833
You like it right?
Yes, very much.

13:06.041 --> 13:08.291
Hey Jonny, where'd you get
a jacket like that?

13:08.500 --> 13:11.333
Here comes the popo.
Who cares where I got it?

13:11.541 --> 13:12.625
Hey Bobby, you made it.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.333
Of course I made it,
what do you mean?

13:14.541 --> 13:15.958
I thought you had to work.

13:16.166 --> 13:17.208
No, I left early.

13:17.416 --> 13:19.000
How's she doing in there?

13:20.125 --> 13:21.041
Terrible.

13:42.083 --> 13:45.250
I can't hold on,
slow down, slow down!

13:46.458 --> 13:49.583
One step, two steps,
three steps...

13:49.791 --> 13:52.875
You're going to make it.
I'm so scared!

13:53.666 --> 13:56.666
Oh my god, oh my god!
Jesus Christ!

14:00.000 --> 14:02.458
It's freezing outside.
You don't wanna go like this.

14:04.041 --> 14:05.666
Come on, come on, here.

14:05.875 --> 14:07.666
Here, left leg, come on.

14:08.375 --> 14:10.375
He's on his way, alright?
Here we go.

14:12.125 --> 14:14.958
God, it hurts so bad!
Okay, I know.

14:15.125 --> 14:19.583
We really don't wanna have
the baby on the side of the...

14:19.791 --> 14:22.916
okay, Jonny...
Oh, thank god.

14:23.208 --> 14:25.166
I'm gonna get your coat, okay?

14:26.375 --> 14:27.458
You're okay.

14:31.166 --> 14:32.750
Are you okay?

14:33.625 --> 14:34.791
She's okay.

14:52.333 --> 14:54.750
Mitchell, I gotta get
Mary back to school.

14:54.916 --> 14:56.333
How long are you planning
on staying?

14:56.541 --> 14:57.916
I dunno, maybe hang out.

14:58.125 --> 14:59.458
Mary's in school?

14:59.666 --> 15:01.916
Yeah, she started
after Labor Day.

15:02.666 --> 15:04.500
What do you go
to school for, Mary?

15:04.708 --> 15:06.708
You're too little.
It's pre-school.

15:06.916 --> 15:08.166
Where's that pre-school?

15:08.375 --> 15:11.208
One just opened up
on the highway near Bobby D's.

15:11.416 --> 15:12.666
That's a day-care center.

15:14.083 --> 15:16.125
Don't say it in front of Val.
It's a pre-school.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.750
Looks like a recruiting station
with mats on the floor.

15:18.958 --> 15:20.666
John, Mary likes it,

15:20.875 --> 15:23.250
she's four years old,
so shut the fuck up.

15:23.458 --> 15:24.708
I'm sorry.

15:25.583 --> 15:26.958
Alright, baby...

15:27.333 --> 15:28.333
okay.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.666
Bye, guys.
Bye.

15:33.958 --> 15:35.291
Hey, Jonny...

15:36.291 --> 15:37.750
Look who's here.

15:40.916 --> 15:43.250
Get the fuck outa here!

15:49.416 --> 15:51.708
Did you know she was coming?

16:00.916 --> 16:02.500
Ruth.
Hi.

16:04.791 --> 16:06.666
I'm so glad you're here.

16:06.875 --> 16:09.250
My sister said
she would call you.

16:21.833 --> 16:24.041
Who are you guys talking about?

16:24.333 --> 16:26.000
It doesn't matter.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.708
Should I be worried?

16:31.166 --> 16:32.166
Where?

16:33.333 --> 16:35.000
Just outside Staples
right after closing.

16:35.291 --> 16:37.291
He went to get
a new printer for me,

16:37.500 --> 16:39.791
and as he was taking it back
to the parking lot,

16:40.000 --> 16:41.875
a bunch of boys on bikes...

16:42.083 --> 16:43.791
Some of them were 12 years old.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.083
I can't believe that.

16:45.291 --> 16:47.541
They took his wallet,
they took the man,

16:47.750 --> 16:49.750
they dumped it at the beach.

16:49.958 --> 16:52.125
They shot him in the chest.

16:55.583 --> 16:56.958
Why...?

16:57.875 --> 16:59.708
What do we do?

17:01.958 --> 17:05.540
Just put your address
in that fishbowl over there.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.040
I will.

17:07.250 --> 17:10.208
That's my rainy day job
so I can find everyone

17:10.415 --> 17:13.415
after these pills
they gave me wear off.

17:13.625 --> 17:15.165
...absolutely.
You dated a goalie?

17:15.375 --> 17:16.750
I fell in love with a goalie.

17:16.958 --> 17:18.583
Used to write her poems.

17:18.833 --> 17:21.333
Fuck, I never told you
about that!

17:21.540 --> 17:25.083
Jonny, did you tell him that
I wrote the hockey goalie poems?

17:25.290 --> 17:26.958
I felt very deeply about her,

17:27.165 --> 17:28.875
she was a strong woman,
and I like strong women.

17:29.083 --> 17:31.416
You know he cried for 3 days
when she broke up with him.

17:31.625 --> 17:34.458
I did not cry, I had pink eye.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.291
This is a big deal, alright?
Jesus!

17:42.458 --> 17:44.625
Who told you
I broke up with her?

17:44.833 --> 17:46.458
Jonny, you're an asshole,
you know that?

17:46.666 --> 17:50.041
I told you in confidence about
the haikus I sent to Patricia.

17:50.250 --> 17:52.916
And you tell this guy?
All 400 of them.

17:53.125 --> 17:56.666
I didn't write 400 of them!
And like 50 mix tapes too.

17:57.708 --> 17:58.958
I'm going in.

17:59.166 --> 18:00.625
You alright?
Yeah.

18:00.916 --> 18:02.916
Get me another wine.
Yeah, sure.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.708
You vibe with this crowd?

18:05.166 --> 18:06.458
Be right back.

18:32.916 --> 18:35.083
Who sold you that lock?

18:39.208 --> 18:40.541
Answer me.

18:41.583 --> 18:43.250
If you don't want people
breaking in here,

18:43.458 --> 18:45.750
you need a regular fox lock.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.458
And window guards, by the way.

18:48.666 --> 18:50.458
They don't make
fox locks anymore.

18:50.666 --> 18:53.541
Yes, they do, Abby Locksmith.
What are you doing here?

18:53.750 --> 18:55.291
I was kinda meditating.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.708
You have to get out.

18:57.125 --> 18:59.125
I looked for you today
at the service.

18:59.333 --> 19:00.375
I was there.

19:01.666 --> 19:02.666
Did you see me?
Yeah, through the window.

19:03.875 --> 19:04.958
Yeah, I saw you too.
You didn't say hello.

19:05.125 --> 19:07.000
You smell like something.

19:07.916 --> 19:09.375
Probably smell like the subway.

19:09.583 --> 19:10.791
You have a cutting board?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.166
On the counter. Why?
What are you doing?

19:13.416 --> 19:14.666
This thing? Plastic.

19:14.875 --> 19:15.583
Leave it there.

19:20.375 --> 19:21.333
That'll do.

19:22.750 --> 19:24.875
I don't want your help,
so if you could put that back.

19:34.625 --> 19:35.583
Hey!

19:35.958 --> 19:37.833
I've been looking for these.

19:38.291 --> 19:40.500
Didn't have a chance
to return them.

20:20.916 --> 20:22.083
Is that to keep you out?

20:22.291 --> 20:24.083
Right now, it's keeping me in.

20:24.291 --> 20:27.083
How do you know where I live?

20:33.833 --> 20:36.125
You broke into
my apartment, Jonny?

20:36.500 --> 20:38.500
You said my name.
That wasn't for you.

20:38.708 --> 20:39.875
What's this bird?

20:40.250 --> 20:41.458
A lark.

20:42.166 --> 20:44.708
The lady larks.
The lady larks!

20:45.833 --> 20:48.416
Head of Admissions,
that's your job?

20:49.166 --> 20:51.750
What are you trying
to make them admit?

20:53.500 --> 20:55.916
I'm just kidding,
I know what it means.

20:56.125 --> 20:57.750
There's not enough room
for everyone,

20:57.958 --> 20:59.916
so you get to pick the winners.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.500
I'm sure it's very fair.

21:01.708 --> 21:04.208
What are you doing here?
How much do they pay you?

21:04.416 --> 21:05.375
I'm sure it's not enough.

21:05.583 --> 21:07.000
I think it's enough.

21:07.208 --> 21:09.208
Why aren't you coaching track?
I changed jobs.

21:09.375 --> 21:11.625
I switched schools.
What about the kids at Pompei?

21:11.833 --> 21:14.083
I don't know, they got
somebody else to coach the team,

21:14.291 --> 21:15.208
it's not a big deal.

21:16.583 --> 21:18.416
Those kids got national
recognition, thanks to you.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.375
A trip to the White House.

21:20.583 --> 21:21.875
Yeah, you heard about that.

21:22.083 --> 21:24.583
It was in the news,
I know how to read.

21:25.166 --> 21:27.125
So, you have a girlfriend?

21:27.458 --> 21:29.125
Does she know that you're here?

21:29.333 --> 21:31.250
What's her name?
Kandy.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.958
Why did you come here?

21:35.833 --> 21:37.666
I don't have coach
telling me not to anymore.

21:37.875 --> 21:39.958
Jonny...
I'm serious.

21:40.875 --> 21:41.666
If it wasn't for Coach...

21:42.791 --> 21:44.000
I'd still be working
at Dunkin' Donuts.

21:44.250 --> 21:45.958
Like Kandy.
What do you mean?

21:46.166 --> 21:47.333
That's where she works.

21:49.791 --> 21:51.833
Well, I didn't know that.

21:54.083 --> 21:55.583
That's not what I meant.

21:55.791 --> 21:58.083
That's okay, you get paid more,
you work more.

21:58.291 --> 22:00.416
You don't know me anymore.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.125
You don't know
what I do every day.

22:03.333 --> 22:04.833
You don't know
the people I work with.

22:05.041 --> 22:06.500
I could get to know them.

22:06.708 --> 22:08.958
You don't get to know them.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.375
Sticker knows them,
he knows these people.

22:16.583 --> 22:18.541
You're not the only one
who works in this neighborhood.

22:18.750 --> 22:19.125
Sticker?

22:20.125 --> 22:20.833
Sticker has a job
on Park Avenue,

22:21.916 --> 22:22.916
he got married,
they have a nice place.

22:23.125 --> 22:24.250
Sticker got married?
Yeah.

22:24.458 --> 22:24.916
To who?

22:26.166 --> 22:27.458
You don't know her.
Where does he work?

22:27.791 --> 22:29.166
What is he, a doorman?

22:30.958 --> 22:32.125
Might have
some people in common.

22:32.291 --> 22:33.458
We don't have people in common.

22:33.666 --> 22:34.916
You might!

22:36.500 --> 22:37.750
Sticker knows these people,
too bad they don't know him.

22:37.958 --> 22:39.000
They look right through him.

22:40.666 --> 22:41.750
It's not their responsibility
to see that Sticker's a thief?

22:43.291 --> 22:44.000
Don't take anything out of there
or I'll call the cops.

22:45.000 --> 22:45.583
This place is nice.
Get out.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.041
What do you pay?
Get out!

22:48.625 --> 22:50.666
Why do you get upset if I ask
what do you pay for this life?

22:57.583 --> 22:58.291
What're you doing?

22:59.916 --> 23:01.666
Trying to get these nails out
so I can throw it at your head,

23:01.875 --> 23:03.458
and kill you with it.

23:04.291 --> 23:06.166
Why don't you use the hammer?

23:26.750 --> 23:29.291
Hello, Mr. Brinckerhoff.
Hello, ladies.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.000
Duffy, there you are.

23:33.208 --> 23:34.041
You got a minute?

23:35.125 --> 23:35.958
You look worried.
Don't be worried.

23:37.125 --> 23:37.458
Come outside with me,
just for a minute.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.333
Ashley, can you bring
this upstairs for us?

23:42.500 --> 23:44.250
I've been looking for you.
What did I do?

23:44.458 --> 23:47.458
Well, apparently,
you have put together

23:47.666 --> 23:51.041
a very provocative record
of action some years ago.

23:51.250 --> 23:54.916
King's Point. Port Washington,
Sands Point, Baxter Estates.

23:55.083 --> 23:57.083
Coastal communities
in Long Island?

23:57.291 --> 23:59.083
Across the bay
from Locust Point.

23:59.291 --> 24:01.500
Four convictions in one year?

24:01.708 --> 24:04.375
I was a minor.
Yes, you were a minor.

24:04.583 --> 24:06.458
It never went to Criminal Court
for an adult conviction.

24:06.666 --> 24:08.791
But you're way past
being a minor now.

24:09.125 --> 24:11.583
Now you're
an accomplished woman.

24:12.583 --> 24:14.583
Wasn't my record sealed?
Yes.

24:17.458 --> 24:18.666
I am sorry.

24:20.000 --> 24:20.916
Sorry for what you did
or sorry that I found out?

24:21.125 --> 24:22.208
Both.

24:23.208 --> 24:24.500
Breaking and entering.

24:24.708 --> 24:26.708
Assault.
Resisting arrest.

24:26.916 --> 24:29.291
The assault was
part of resisting arrest.

24:29.500 --> 24:30.791
Oh, okay.

24:32.083 --> 24:34.166
Are you telling me to resign?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.833
Now why would I do that?

24:37.250 --> 24:39.666
I just want you to know
what I know.

24:40.583 --> 24:42.583
I was wondering if
I could persuade you

24:42.791 --> 24:45.166
to come to brunch
this weekend at the house.

24:45.375 --> 24:47.666
Check your schedule.
See if you're free.

24:50.375 --> 24:51.500
What else do you know?

24:51.708 --> 24:53.458
That you're good in your job.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.458
I was the last choice.

24:56.583 --> 24:57.875
So what?

24:58.958 --> 25:01.583
I don't think
you're going to let us down.

25:08.208 --> 25:10.541
Allison, why are you laughing?
I'm not kidding about this!

25:10.750 --> 25:14.500
No, he's not here, I'm outside.
I'm talking about real money!

25:14.708 --> 25:17.083
No, it's not the price
of living in New York!

25:17.291 --> 25:19.541
It's called Civil Forfeiture.

25:20.166 --> 25:22.250
I can just ship it to England.
I won't put your name on it.

25:22.458 --> 25:24.333
Just don't tell Mom, okay?

25:25.708 --> 25:27.166
Allison?

25:28.083 --> 25:29.125
Hello?

25:29.958 --> 25:31.375
Did she just hang up on me?

25:31.583 --> 25:33.916
Jesus Christ!
She's as bad as Steven!

25:34.125 --> 25:35.541
Can we get a cab, please?

25:35.750 --> 25:37.875
Yep, absolutely, Mrs. Nobel.
Thanks.

25:38.083 --> 25:39.625
Hi, Dorset!
Hi.

25:39.833 --> 25:43.083
Mommy, are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine, why?

25:43.291 --> 25:45.791
They didn't come for Daddy,
did they?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.416
Dorset, no.

25:47.625 --> 25:49.416
Nobody's coming for Daddy.

25:53.583 --> 25:55.041
Here we go.
Thanks.

25:55.416 --> 25:56.833
Mrs. Noble...

26:00.458 --> 26:01.666
Hey.
Hey.

26:01.875 --> 26:02.958
What's up, buddy?

26:03.166 --> 26:04.166
Who is that?

26:04.375 --> 26:05.750
That's Mrs. Nobel.

26:05.958 --> 26:07.416
What's her first name?

26:07.791 --> 26:09.375
I don't know her first name.

26:09.583 --> 26:12.750
Mr. and Mrs. Noble, 7B...

26:13.750 --> 26:16.500
Hold on one second...

26:17.000 --> 26:18.583
Nan, Nan Noble.

26:18.791 --> 26:19.750
What's the kid's name?

26:20.875 --> 26:22.500
The kid's name you just saw
is Dorset.

26:22.708 --> 26:24.708
They've got another kid
named Murphy.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.541
Dorset Noble?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.625
They make her ride
to school on a pony?

26:28.833 --> 26:31.250
Hey, she's a good kid, alright?

26:31.916 --> 26:33.083
What's the boy's name?

26:33.291 --> 26:34.708
No, it's a girl,
they're both girls.

26:34.916 --> 26:36.958
Murphy, she's the little one.

26:37.208 --> 26:38.625
So they go to the same school?

26:38.833 --> 26:41.791
No, Murphy's too young,
she's applying to kindergarden.

26:42.250 --> 26:43.416
Who are these people?

26:43.625 --> 26:44.666
The guy's in finance...

26:44.875 --> 26:46.916
Get your hand off my papers,

26:47.250 --> 26:48.375
Excuse me.

26:48.958 --> 26:50.666
The guy's in finance, okay?

26:50.875 --> 26:52.208
He used to be at work
all the time,

26:52.416 --> 26:54.416
stopped 3 or 4 weeks ago.

26:54.625 --> 26:55.583
How come?

26:56.916 --> 26:58.375
I don't know, he walks around
in a bathrobe now.

26:58.583 --> 27:00.541
Why?
Is he in some kinda trouble?

27:00.750 --> 27:04.250
Dude, I open the door,
I close the door, okay?

27:04.458 --> 27:06.083
He doesn't talk to me.

27:07.916 --> 27:09.875
He gets a lot of
lattes delivered, and envelopes,

27:10.083 --> 27:11.583
that's all I know.

27:12.166 --> 27:13.125
From who?

27:13.708 --> 27:15.083
From lawyers.

27:15.583 --> 27:18.500
What are talking about here,
Jonny? Breaking in?

27:18.708 --> 27:19.375
Are you crazy?

27:20.583 --> 27:21.416
I can't rob their apartment.
I work here!

27:21.625 --> 27:23.333
I'm not gonna lose this job, okay?

27:23.583 --> 27:24.708
We're not breaking in,

27:24.916 --> 27:27.583
you just told me
he's home all the time.

27:27.791 --> 27:29.958
One thing, though,
that red bird.

27:30.166 --> 27:31.875
Goes to the same school as Ruth.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.375
Jonny...

27:33.750 --> 27:35.375
It's not about Ruth.

27:35.625 --> 27:37.250
Maybe she could be helpful.

27:38.041 --> 27:39.583
Jesus, there we go
with this fuckin' guy.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.416
Can I borrow
one of these shirts?

27:43.125 --> 27:43.958
No!

27:45.083 --> 27:46.458
I'm really sorry,
Mrs. Martin called.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.291
I tried to stop them!

27:48.500 --> 27:51.625
As soon as we hit 8:30,
those women pushed like animals.

27:51.833 --> 27:55.166
You have to start by separating
the adults from the children.

27:56.791 --> 27:57.583
Just give it to me!

27:59.083 --> 28:01.250
I'm not supposed to let
anyone else ever have my phone.

28:01.458 --> 28:02.666
Are you out of your mind?

28:02.875 --> 28:04.041
We lost our phones
or we wouldn't ask.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.916
That's really not my problem.

28:06.083 --> 28:06.791
What's going on in here?

28:07.958 --> 28:09.000
We just got robbed.
We were mugged.

28:09.291 --> 28:10.541
What are you talking about?

28:10.750 --> 28:12.000
Me and Maxine.
We were in the Park.

28:12.208 --> 28:13.291
Which park?

28:13.500 --> 28:14.958
Central Park.
What other park?

28:15.166 --> 28:16.416
Two guys came up behind us.

28:16.625 --> 28:17.708
What did they look like?

28:19.416 --> 28:20.500
The one we saw had his hood up,
he wouldn't let us turn around.

28:20.708 --> 28:21.750
He took our phones
and our wallets.

28:21.958 --> 28:23.041
How old were they?

28:23.250 --> 28:24.750
Your age, I guess.

28:25.583 --> 28:26.291
Did you call the cops?

28:27.166 --> 28:27.375
No, we didn't have our phones!

28:28.375 --> 28:29.375
Mrs. Hazard,
we just got mugged!

28:29.583 --> 28:31.416
Oh my god, are you okay?

28:31.625 --> 28:32.833
They took our wallets
and our phones.

28:33.041 --> 28:34.333
Will somebody find our stuff?

28:34.541 --> 28:36.916
Ingrid, come with me.
Who's 'they'?

28:38.416 --> 28:39.541
The police.

28:40.583 --> 28:42.916
Okay, come with me, girls.

29:46.625 --> 29:48.833
Those windows are an invitation.

29:49.041 --> 29:51.041
I think I told you that.

29:55.041 --> 29:56.500
Jonny.

30:13.583 --> 30:15.750
Do you know a kid
named Dorset Noble?

30:15.958 --> 30:16.958
What are you talking about?

30:17.166 --> 30:18.958
She goes to your school.

30:19.291 --> 30:21.208
I think she's in third grade.

30:22.375 --> 30:23.166
What's the matter?

30:25.333 --> 30:26.333
How do you know her?

30:27.541 --> 30:28.666
I don't know her.
You know her name.

30:30.083 --> 30:30.708
She has a little sister
hoping to get into kindergarten.

30:31.791 --> 30:33.083
I thought you might
know her family.

30:33.458 --> 30:35.083
Isn't that your job?

30:38.333 --> 30:39.125
Ouch!

30:39.750 --> 30:40.375
Ow!

30:41.500 --> 30:43.375
Jesus Christ, god,
you're an animal!

30:44.250 --> 30:45.416
Stop it.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.750
Shit, you have a temper.

31:02.250 --> 31:03.625
What is that?

31:03.958 --> 31:05.250
It's for you.

31:15.458 --> 31:16.833
This isn't funny.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.958
You don't know what happened.

31:19.166 --> 31:21.375
You robbed these kids.
They're 16 years old.

31:21.583 --> 31:24.000
You just feed off anyone
who has something to do with me?

31:24.208 --> 31:25.166
This had nothing to do with you.

31:26.250 --> 31:26.791
These two girls
were in Central Park,

31:27.875 --> 31:28.541
wearing their tank-tops
and flip flops,

31:29.833 --> 31:31.375
sitting there, licking
butter off their fingers.

31:31.583 --> 31:33.708
What did you say to them?
I didn't say a word!

31:33.875 --> 31:35.333
They jumped in the fountain
in their underwear.

31:35.541 --> 31:36.541
Left all this on the bench.

31:37.958 --> 31:39.041
It was too easy.
That's not what they told me.

31:39.250 --> 31:40.166
I'm not surprised.

31:40.375 --> 31:42.333
Could you leave me alone?

31:43.208 --> 31:45.291
I've been trying, Ruth.

31:47.375 --> 31:48.666
I really have.

31:52.458 --> 31:53.750
You know...

31:55.458 --> 31:58.916
You want to live your life
with strangers, go ahead.

31:59.625 --> 32:00.708
It suits you.

32:00.916 --> 32:03.000
You think I forgot about you?

32:03.500 --> 32:05.208
Forgot about Coach?

32:05.791 --> 32:07.375
I know what he did.

32:08.291 --> 32:11.708
He dealt with your dad,
my mom, she was useless.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.375
He was the only one
willing to be there,

32:16.583 --> 32:18.791
willing to sign the papers.

33:02.916 --> 33:04.375
Who's shoulder is that?

33:05.291 --> 33:06.458
I don't know.

33:14.458 --> 33:16.000
Oh...

33:22.416 --> 33:24.125
You giving these to me?

33:24.666 --> 33:25.708
No.

35:03.583 --> 35:05.708
Sit down,
eat your breakfast, Murphy.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.291
So what are you doing today?

35:19.500 --> 35:21.583
Doing the tour, I told you.

35:22.750 --> 35:24.375
In tennis shoes?

35:24.666 --> 35:26.166
They don't care.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.083
Steve Noble.

35:37.291 --> 35:38.625
Yeah, I'll be right down.

35:40.958 --> 35:43.166
Don't have to announce yourself.
He knows who he called.

35:43.333 --> 35:45.083
Yes, but you don't have to tell
me how to talk to a doorman.

35:45.291 --> 35:45.875
It's an envelope.

35:47.333 --> 35:48.916
May I go down for it, Daddy?
No, Dorset, I got it.

35:58.125 --> 36:00.250
I got it.

36:03.500 --> 36:04.791
It says Turvey and Bates.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.958
That's for Daddy.
Let me talk.

36:08.125 --> 36:09.375
Hi, Dan.

36:09.583 --> 36:11.208
Terrible. How are you?

36:11.458 --> 36:12.541
He just went downstairs.

36:12.750 --> 36:14.666
Want him to call you back?

36:14.875 --> 36:16.750
Yeah, sure, what is it?

36:17.333 --> 36:19.500
Yea, of course I'm listening.

36:20.750 --> 36:22.375
You told me that before,

36:22.583 --> 36:25.375
but I don't like
hearing you say it again.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.125
Okay, I'm taking it as a friend,

36:29.333 --> 36:31.875
but what kind of risk
do you mean?

36:35.875 --> 36:37.541
Oh my god...

36:41.083 --> 36:42.458
Oh, my god...

36:44.041 --> 36:44.875
Hmmm...

36:45.083 --> 36:48.583
And when would that happen?

36:51.291 --> 36:52.666
Dan, I can't
talk about this now.

36:52.875 --> 36:54.416
I've got to get
the kids to school.

36:54.625 --> 36:57.416
I'll call you back later,
yeah, okay.

36:57.625 --> 36:58.208
Bye.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.708
Alright, here we are
in the cafeteria, walk right in.

37:11.458 --> 37:14.625
I have idea what I'm doing here.

37:15.208 --> 37:18.166
Couldn't get a waiver?
I've given this tour.

37:18.541 --> 37:20.416
Okay, can everyone hear me?

37:20.708 --> 37:23.583
Miss Duffy,
our Interim Head of Admissions,

37:23.791 --> 37:25.875
is joining
this part of the tour.

37:26.083 --> 37:28.958
Thanks, Ashley. Hi, everyone.
So good to see you.

37:29.166 --> 37:31.333
I just want to say a few words
about our cafeteria.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.708
First of all, as of next month,
we'll be installing

37:33.916 --> 37:35.541
a brand-new, state-of-the-art

37:35.750 --> 37:37.291
raw juice bar,
right along this wall...

37:37.500 --> 37:39.750
...which was my husband's idea.

37:40.291 --> 37:42.583
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

37:42.791 --> 37:43.625
Sorry...

37:44.458 --> 37:47.333
I do have a comment, if I may.

37:48.541 --> 37:52.541
Maybe it's more of a question.
Of course, what is it?

37:52.750 --> 37:56.625
I've heard several rumors
that Luscinia is re-thinking

37:56.833 --> 38:00.083
financial need for applicants
in the lower grades and

38:00.291 --> 38:03.333
I need to know what that means

38:03.541 --> 38:05.666
for those of us
who are already here,

38:05.875 --> 38:09.750
those of us who have been
part of this community

38:09.958 --> 38:11.208
for many many years.

38:11.416 --> 38:13.000
Mrs. Noble...
No, Ashley...

38:13.208 --> 38:16.375
I really feel like
this needs to be said, okay?

38:16.833 --> 38:19.000
When the tide goes out,

38:19.375 --> 38:23.541
you don't leave your best fish
to die on the shore.

38:25.291 --> 38:28.791
Mrs. Noble, I don't think
anyone's going to die.

38:32.708 --> 38:36.375
Well, I hope you're right,
I have to take a call.

38:37.333 --> 38:41.125
I'm sure she'll catch up.
If everyone else can follow me?

38:50.125 --> 38:51.958
Think the pants are too much?

38:52.250 --> 38:53.958
What do you want from me?

38:54.166 --> 38:57.208
I just wanna see where you work.

38:58.500 --> 39:01.000
This isn't a game.
Oh, yes it is.

39:01.375 --> 39:03.416
Big winnings.

39:24.291 --> 39:25.750
Nan?
Yes!

39:26.125 --> 39:28.041
Are you alright?

39:28.791 --> 39:30.166
I'm sorry.

39:31.208 --> 39:32.416
Do we know each other?

39:32.625 --> 39:34.125
You look like
you need some help.

39:34.333 --> 39:36.208
Can I call someone for you?

39:37.083 --> 39:38.333
Like who?

39:38.541 --> 39:41.041
I don't know, your husband?
Oh my god, no!

39:41.250 --> 39:42.750
Are you kidding me?

39:47.416 --> 39:50.708
Thank you...
My god, I know these two!

39:57.291 --> 39:59.666
So were you on the tour?

39:59.875 --> 40:01.583
Looks like we both left early.

40:01.791 --> 40:06.125
No, I just wanted
to stop by Dorset's rehearsal.

40:06.708 --> 40:09.833
My older daughter,
but I didn't stay.

40:10.458 --> 40:12.250
Autumn Assembly.

40:12.500 --> 40:15.416
Native American
song book this year.

40:18.291 --> 40:22.250
Seriously I'd like to know
who chooses the songs they sing.

40:22.458 --> 40:24.833
It used to be so meaningful.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.291
I honestly don't get the Navajo.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.083
At least the Apaches
fought it out.

40:29.291 --> 40:30.708
If you gonna fight, fight.

40:30.916 --> 40:31.708
I can admire that.

40:31.916 --> 40:33.375
But the Navajo, Jesus,

40:33.541 --> 40:36.333
their way to fight
was to steal you blind.

40:36.875 --> 40:39.083
I'm not sure that's true.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.458
Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know.

40:45.625 --> 40:47.666
Look, I have to run, but...

40:47.958 --> 40:49.458
I hope your daughter
gets into the class.

40:49.666 --> 40:50.708
Hope yours does, too.

40:50.916 --> 40:51.875
Oh, she'll be fine.

40:53.583 --> 40:55.875
She's smart, she's not deranged,
so she should be an easy one.

40:56.083 --> 40:59.583
Assuming the Board doesn't vote
to eliminate the normal kids.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.500
My husband says
he'll burn down the Field House

41:01.708 --> 41:05.000
if they give Murphy's spot away
to a little kid from the Bronx.

41:05.208 --> 41:07.708
They could build
another Field House.

41:09.750 --> 41:11.416
He was kidding.

41:11.791 --> 41:13.375
So was I.

41:15.166 --> 41:18.208
I'm Jonny.
Oh, I'm Nan.

41:18.875 --> 41:20.250
Nan Noble.

41:33.916 --> 41:35.791
Duffy, there you are!

41:36.208 --> 41:38.458
You owe me a RSVP, I believe.

41:38.708 --> 41:41.000
Babe needs to know
if you're coming.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.166
We need the number.

41:43.625 --> 41:45.291
Sure, would love to.

41:46.083 --> 41:47.500
Excellent!

41:56.791 --> 41:58.458
Excuse me.
Hi.

41:58.958 --> 42:00.750
I need an application.

42:01.250 --> 42:03.416
Were you just on the tour?

42:04.583 --> 42:05.291
Yes.

42:06.625 --> 42:07.791
You took the tour before
submitting an application.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.458
You can't do that.

42:09.666 --> 42:10.750
Really?

42:13.500 --> 42:16.416
Look, Melanie,
such a pretty name...

42:17.250 --> 42:18.583
Don't you think you could just

42:18.791 --> 42:20.041
give me one now?

42:21.416 --> 42:24.208
Fine, I have one here.

42:27.541 --> 42:28.541
Thank you.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.041
Let me get you an envelope.

42:37.791 --> 42:39.916
'“Please tell us
about your child.'”

42:40.125 --> 42:42.916
Say how smart she is.
I said that.

42:43.333 --> 42:46.541
Say you wish you were her dad.
I'm saying I am her dad.

42:46.750 --> 42:47.500
What do you mean?

42:48.916 --> 42:49.625
'“Please give specific examples
of your child's

42:49.833 --> 42:51.083
'particular strengths.'

42:52.583 --> 42:54.375
'Describe any special needs
or areas needing support.'”

42:54.583 --> 42:57.333
She's four years old.
All she's got are special needs.

42:57.541 --> 42:59.583
Wait, what are you doing?

43:00.583 --> 43:04.166
I'm filling out the questions,
it's an application for Mary.

43:04.375 --> 43:06.083
Why isn't Sticker doing this?

43:06.291 --> 43:08.291
I didn't tell him about it.

43:08.541 --> 43:09.500
'Why...
Are you kidding?

43:09.708 --> 43:11.875
'Are you interested
in our school?'

43:12.083 --> 43:13.625
That's a very good question.

43:13.833 --> 43:16.166
Who wouldn't want
what those kids have got?

43:16.375 --> 43:17.958
It's a gold mine over there.

43:18.166 --> 43:19.791
Yeah, I wouldn't
write that down.

43:19.958 --> 43:22.708
The pen is not great.
I hope it isn't too messy.

43:22.916 --> 43:25.208
It's a mess because
Mary's not your kid.

43:25.416 --> 43:27.000
Bobby, I work in a coat closet.

43:27.208 --> 43:29.291
I'm gonna put
whatever I can into this.

43:29.500 --> 43:31.916
It's messy, it's not messy,
it's an opportunity.

43:32.125 --> 43:33.708
This isn't for Mary.
This is for Ruth.

43:33.916 --> 43:36.166
Yeah, I want Ruth
to read it and like it, okay?

43:36.375 --> 43:38.250
That's what she does.
She reads.

43:44.416 --> 43:45.750
Hey, Sticker...

43:49.375 --> 43:51.000
Oh yeah? When?

43:52.875 --> 43:54.708
Can I have something
to write on?

43:58.416 --> 43:59.416
Alright...

43:59.625 --> 44:00.916
What's the address?

44:01.083 --> 44:02.166
Ah-hah...

44:02.875 --> 44:04.750
What's the apartment number?

44:05.166 --> 44:06.875
Oh, of course it's not.

44:07.333 --> 44:09.500
Oh, so it's like a lunch?

44:10.208 --> 44:11.416
Brunch?

44:19.375 --> 44:21.041
Mrs. Noble, hi!

44:21.250 --> 44:24.000
Hey, this was just
delivered for you.

44:25.416 --> 44:26.833
Thanks, Spencer.

44:27.041 --> 44:28.916
I'm not Spencer.

44:29.625 --> 44:31.833
Oh, yeah, you aren't.

44:32.041 --> 44:35.583
Yeah, I think I may have taken
Spencer's place.

44:35.791 --> 44:37.625
I started back in March.

44:38.041 --> 44:39.500
My name's Mitchell.

44:42.041 --> 44:44.125
Steven couldn't make it.
Figured.

44:44.708 --> 44:48.250
Guy, I need to talk to you.
It's not about Steven.

44:48.458 --> 44:49.625
It's about me.

44:51.125 --> 44:52.791
I'd love to help you, Nan,
but you have your own lawyer.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.250
I know nothing about this.

44:55.750 --> 44:57.625
You don't need me.
Dan is terrific.

44:57.833 --> 44:59.125
Dan's not like you.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.041
Tell me what's going on.

45:04.250 --> 45:05.416
Keep it short.

45:06.166 --> 45:07.250
Okay...

45:08.583 --> 45:12.333
It all started with a lawsuit
from an investor.

45:12.750 --> 45:14.500
He basically accused Steven

45:14.708 --> 45:17.875
of trading with affiliates,
affiliated dealers.

45:18.250 --> 45:19.708
Isn't that ironic that
someone would accuse Steven

45:19.916 --> 45:22.208
of working too closely
with people he knew,

45:22.416 --> 45:25.250
with friends, when Steven
really doesn't have any friends.

45:25.416 --> 45:28.958
The asshole who sued him,
we've known the guy for years,

45:29.166 --> 45:31.458
He's a paranoid
sex addict and honestly,

45:31.666 --> 45:34.125
his problems have nothing to do
with Steven!

45:34.333 --> 45:35.666
The case went to civil court,

45:35.875 --> 45:37.750
Steven should have settled, but

45:37.958 --> 45:39.000
once that happened,

45:40.208 --> 45:41.333
things just started
rolling away from him.

45:42.916 --> 45:45.666
Other accusations cropped up
that he lied about the brokers.

45:45.875 --> 45:50.083
He had audit issues in the past,
and that came up again too.

45:50.291 --> 45:52.125
It should not come
as any surprise,

45:52.333 --> 45:53.625
that Steven can't deal
with audits.

45:53.833 --> 45:55.625
He's never been any good
at listening to people

45:55.833 --> 45:57.541
tell him what to do but...

45:57.750 --> 46:00.333
Along the way,
the US Attorney got involved,

46:00.541 --> 46:04.125
and the civil went
to criminal, and now...

46:04.333 --> 46:06.291
I...
Okay, Nan...

46:06.458 --> 46:08.083
It's too much, you don't need
to tell me this much,

46:08.291 --> 46:09.208
let's get a drink.

46:10.500 --> 46:12.250
But Guy, I do...
Dan will take care of it.

46:12.458 --> 46:13.333
I have to...

46:14.083 --> 46:15.125
I'm...

46:15.875 --> 46:17.875
I'm worried about his seizure.

46:18.125 --> 46:19.791
Oh, I hope I don't know
what you mean by that.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.041
I just need
a couple of drawers or

46:22.250 --> 46:24.125
a corner of your laundry room,

46:24.333 --> 46:26.583
just put a box until
this whole thing blows over.

46:26.791 --> 46:28.208
Nan...
What?

46:29.125 --> 46:31.875
Any disruption of property
during this investigation

46:32.083 --> 46:34.250
will put you at risk of arrest.

46:35.833 --> 46:40.333
Look, I would never do anything
actually inappropriate.

46:40.583 --> 46:41.333
Good.

46:42.833 --> 46:45.500
But I can't fill the coffers
of some idiots in Albany!

46:45.833 --> 46:46.958
Washington.

46:47.125 --> 46:49.500
Yeah I know, of course
that's what I meant.

46:49.791 --> 46:51.083
Guy...

46:52.416 --> 46:53.708
You want some advice?
Yes!

46:53.916 --> 46:55.458
This is my advice...

46:55.916 --> 46:58.083
Even if Steven's case
gets settled,

46:58.291 --> 47:00.791
any steps you take to hide
your own assets

47:01.000 --> 47:01.958
will be discovered.

47:02.166 --> 47:04.125
And you will go to jail.

47:05.375 --> 47:06.833
It's not a joke, Nan.

47:13.708 --> 47:15.375
Ruth Duffy!

47:15.583 --> 47:16.250
Have you met Babe?

47:17.500 --> 47:19.458
Babe, Ruth Duffy,
we've been talking about.

47:21.291 --> 47:24.291
Ah, Nan, don't move
the place cards.

47:24.500 --> 47:26.208
I sat Ruth with you, okay?

47:26.416 --> 47:29.000
Has everyone met Miss Duffy?

47:29.375 --> 47:31.833
Our Interim Head of Admissions.

47:32.041 --> 47:33.708
Guy always likes to invite
an extra person

47:33.916 --> 47:35.125
who none of us really knows.

47:35.333 --> 47:36.625
They give us
something to talk about.

47:36.833 --> 47:38.833
We had a writer the last time...

47:39.833 --> 47:40.791
Where are you from?

47:41.916 --> 47:43.708
Not far from here.
Close to the water.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.083
Malcolm and Amy
have a place on the water also.

47:46.291 --> 47:47.833
They can't really live
without water.

47:48.041 --> 47:49.458
When we're out West,
we don't miss it.

47:49.666 --> 47:51.458
You would if that's all you had.

47:51.666 --> 47:53.666
We were just in Mamaroneck
for a wedding...

47:53.875 --> 47:55.875
Mrs. Nobel.
Yeah, hi.

47:56.416 --> 47:58.333
...for sale
for just about nothing.

47:58.541 --> 48:01.541
I hope that's not an invitation
to talk about the economy, Babe.

48:01.750 --> 48:02.833
I want to talk about money.

48:03.041 --> 48:05.416
You had to tell us that
in advance.

48:13.083 --> 48:15.125
Malcolm, get another drink
and be quiet.

48:15.333 --> 48:17.750
Where's Randall?
He'll put money down.

48:19.125 --> 48:21.375
I think he's hiding if this is
about the school endowment.

48:21.583 --> 48:23.041
My suggestion has always been

48:23.250 --> 48:25.125
no more hot paninis
in the cafeteria.

48:25.333 --> 48:27.666
So you're a do-good machine
all of a sudden.

48:27.875 --> 48:30.041
What's that mean
for our wallets though?

48:31.041 --> 48:32.541
Hi, Guy Brinckerhoff.
Jon Collins.

48:32.750 --> 48:34.000
I don't think
we know each other.

48:34.208 --> 48:35.833
I'm a friend of Ruth's.

48:36.041 --> 48:37.166
Made it.

48:38.625 --> 48:39.708
I just stopped by to say hi.
I'm not staying for lunch.

48:39.916 --> 48:42.125
No, no, come on in.
Want a drink?

48:42.333 --> 48:43.333
Sure!
Barbossa?

48:43.541 --> 48:44.250
Sounds good.

48:45.541 --> 48:47.500
You're between Ruth and Nan.
Are you sure?

48:47.833 --> 48:49.541
Friends, Duffy?

48:50.833 --> 48:53.916
Is he out of town?
No, he's at home.

48:54.083 --> 48:56.291
You don't have to
explain it, Nan.

49:00.833 --> 49:03.416
It's a difficult time,
I think we all know that.

49:03.625 --> 49:04.916
Is he alright?

49:05.125 --> 49:07.250
Steven owns a hedge fund.

49:07.500 --> 49:10.583
Very strong, but it's a
difficult time like Nan says.

49:10.791 --> 49:13.375
Let's be honest.
Steven's a bully.

49:13.875 --> 49:14.875
Babe...

49:16.166 --> 49:18.125
No, it's true,
it's part of his success.

49:18.333 --> 49:20.250
His mother's the same.

49:24.208 --> 49:26.125
Excuse me for a minute.

49:28.166 --> 49:29.666
Is she okay?

49:33.208 --> 49:34.625
Is that yours?

49:35.833 --> 49:39.166
Yes, I'm surprised too...
No, of course not.

49:59.791 --> 50:00.916
Hey...

50:01.375 --> 50:03.416
I'm sorry
I asked about your husband.

50:03.625 --> 50:05.791
I feel like
I put you on the spot.

50:06.708 --> 50:10.416
No, you didn't. You couldn't.
He got himself in trouble.

50:11.333 --> 50:13.833
He's in the middle
of a public indictment.

50:14.041 --> 50:15.666
Haven't they
described it to you?

50:15.875 --> 50:18.458
Not really. No.
He's under investigation.

50:18.666 --> 50:20.166
Would you like one of these?
For headaches.

50:20.375 --> 50:21.875
No, I'm okay, thanks.

50:23.333 --> 50:27.375
I should go back in.
I just wanted a little privacy.

50:27.666 --> 50:30.541
It's hard to find
much privacy at a party.

50:31.833 --> 50:34.125
You have no idea
what the government does

50:34.333 --> 50:35.625
to people like us.

50:35.916 --> 50:38.041
My husband isn't a criminal.

50:38.250 --> 50:39.166
He...

50:40.666 --> 50:42.791
pays his taxes, he votes,
he's out there doing his job,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.375
And all of a sudden,
that's illegal!

50:46.166 --> 50:48.208
Do you know what
his lawyer told me?

50:48.416 --> 50:50.583
If Steven gets convicted,

50:50.833 --> 50:53.916
Federal Agents
will come to our home...

50:55.708 --> 50:58.708
and everything
that we've depended on...

51:01.625 --> 51:02.958
Gone.

51:04.250 --> 51:05.833
He might not be convicted.

51:06.041 --> 51:08.000
A property seizure
might not wait.

51:08.208 --> 51:11.208
They could show up tomorrow.
They might be there now.

51:22.708 --> 51:24.750
My husband had this...

51:25.333 --> 51:26.916
winner-take-all approach,

51:27.125 --> 51:29.708
that hasn't exactly
led to friendships

51:29.916 --> 51:31.541
he can count on.

51:32.875 --> 51:34.416
I know what's that like.

51:36.208 --> 51:38.583
I'm just as bad.

51:39.208 --> 51:43.208
I still have friends,
but they're not really friends.

51:44.083 --> 51:46.291
They're something else,
they're...

51:46.875 --> 51:50.500
People.
I have people, but I'm alone.

51:50.958 --> 51:53.000
You have to protect yourself.

51:53.750 --> 51:55.541
What kind of world
do you think I'm living in?

51:55.750 --> 51:57.666
I have absolutely no say

51:57.875 --> 52:00.541
whatsoever in the choices
my husband is making.

52:00.750 --> 52:02.791
Yeah, but you have
just as much to lose.

52:06.208 --> 52:08.500
Oh my god,
look what I did to my shirt.

52:08.708 --> 52:09.791
It's French,

52:11.041 --> 52:12.625
I'm not drunk,
if that's what you think.

52:13.458 --> 52:14.666
I'm struggling.

52:53.833 --> 52:57.500
Sorry, I paid a lot for this bra,
I had to show it to someone.

52:57.708 --> 52:59.916
It's nice.
You're nice.

53:01.333 --> 53:03.208
And you're practical.

53:04.166 --> 53:05.791
You don't really know me.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
That's one of the things
I like most about you.

53:12.833 --> 53:14.250
Will you help me?

53:17.125 --> 53:18.125
Sure.

53:22.041 --> 53:23.083
Thanks.

53:31.750 --> 53:33.916
What are doing?
I'm leaving.

53:42.791 --> 53:44.500
Did he just leave?

56:04.083 --> 56:05.291
I'll be back.

56:05.500 --> 56:06.500
You're not going shopping,
are you?

56:07.791 --> 56:09.041
I'm just returning something.
What is it?

56:10.500 --> 56:12.166
What do you care? It's just
something I didn't like.

56:12.375 --> 56:14.958
Don't get store credit,
get cash.

56:15.166 --> 56:19.541
Okay, I'm meeting someone
at Monty's.

56:19.833 --> 56:23.458
For a glass of wine afterwards.
This afternoon? I wouldn't.

56:23.666 --> 56:24.833
Why not?

56:25.041 --> 56:26.833
Because Dan is coming over.

56:27.041 --> 56:29.041
He's coming today? Why?

56:29.208 --> 56:30.750
Why do you think?

56:31.208 --> 56:32.666
Do I have to be there?

56:33.041 --> 56:34.041
Yes.

56:39.375 --> 56:42.125
Who still goes
to Monty's anyway?

56:49.166 --> 56:50.833
Jonny Collins!

56:51.041 --> 56:51.958
Hey, man!

56:53.000 --> 56:55.250
What the hell
are you doing here?

56:55.458 --> 56:57.541
It's Wegs!
Wegs?

56:58.916 --> 57:00.291
What're you doing here?
I'm...

57:00.500 --> 57:02.250
I'm getting stood up
is what I'm doing.

57:02.458 --> 57:04.166
Wegs, what's up, man?

57:04.791 --> 57:07.625
Sorry.
It's alright, it's your job.

57:08.625 --> 57:10.791
Never mind, forget it.
Good to see you.

57:10.958 --> 57:13.041
Good to see you, too.
How long you worked here?

57:13.250 --> 57:16.750
Stef's here too. We both
got hired a month ago.

57:16.958 --> 57:18.750
So funny.
Yeah...

57:18.958 --> 57:23.083
Hey, are you here for real,
or you working something?

57:23.416 --> 57:25.833
You don't have to tell me,
I just thought, you know.

57:26.041 --> 57:28.958
No, I actually might be putting
something together.

57:29.166 --> 57:31.916
With Sticker and Bobby D.
Awesome.

57:32.750 --> 57:34.458
Check it out.
Stef, what's up, man?

57:34.666 --> 57:35.916
So good to see you!

57:37.416 --> 57:38.916
How are those guys.
They're good, man, we'll see.

57:39.125 --> 57:43.208
Hey, say no more. You need boots
on the ground, call us up.

57:43.416 --> 57:45.083
Alright, thanks, Wegs.

57:45.375 --> 57:46.875
So you get something?

57:47.083 --> 57:49.708
She's not coming,
so I guess I'm leaving.

57:49.916 --> 57:52.041
Lemme give you something, man,
it's fuckin' good.

57:52.250 --> 57:54.291
Just hang on,
I'll be right back.

57:54.958 --> 57:58.375
I'll give you my new number,
if that's cool with you.

57:58.958 --> 58:00.666
Yeah man, that's good.

58:02.833 --> 58:04.125
You have to read
this application.

58:04.333 --> 58:05.083
It just came in today.

58:06.250 --> 58:07.416
Good or bad.
Oh my god, it's good!

58:08.875 --> 58:10.125
It's messy, just ignore that.
It was written by hand.

58:11.625 --> 58:13.250
Mike found it slipped under
the front door this morning.

58:13.458 --> 58:14.958
It's really special.

58:15.166 --> 58:18.291
It's actually moving.
It kind of turned me on.

58:18.500 --> 58:21.083
Let's bring them in.
Looks good.

58:24.375 --> 58:25.666
Yeah...

58:26.291 --> 58:27.708
Hello.

58:28.541 --> 58:30.041
Ah-hah...

58:32.125 --> 58:35.375
Tomorrow is perfect, thank you.
She'll be there.

58:35.541 --> 58:36.333
Alright.

58:40.916 --> 58:43.000
There they are.
Hello, Jonny!

58:43.208 --> 58:46.250
Hey Mary, how you doin?
Hi...

58:46.458 --> 58:47.208
Good.

58:48.208 --> 58:48.625
I'm excited for the zoo, are
you?

58:49.291 --> 58:50.583
Yes, she's excited!

58:50.791 --> 58:54.000
Hey Mary, check it out,
I brought you something.

58:55.541 --> 58:57.708
A magic ball!
What is it?

58:57.916 --> 59:00.166
I told you, what are you doing,
stop shaking it.

59:00.375 --> 59:02.583
Stop shaking it,
what are you doing?

59:02.791 --> 59:04.000
Is something inside?

59:05.333 --> 59:08.416
No, don't open it, c'mon,
you'll wreck the magic.

59:09.416 --> 59:11.625
Hey, what the hell is that?

59:12.083 --> 59:13.833
It's cream cheese.

59:14.041 --> 59:16.791
Jesus, Jonny, you idiot,
that's from your bagel!

59:16.958 --> 59:17.875
Doesn't mean it's not magic.

59:19.541 --> 59:20.875
I gotta drop Val off at work and
I don't have to be in until 10.

59:21.083 --> 59:23.250
Do you guys need a ride?
No.

59:24.291 --> 59:27.125
Make it educational, Jonny.
Yes, ma'am,

59:28.583 --> 59:29.875
Bye Mom, bye Dad...

59:30.083 --> 59:32.041
Hey, make sure
she wears this, okay?

59:32.250 --> 59:34.083
Bye, baby.
Ready?

59:34.708 --> 59:37.625
We should take the bus
to get to the zoo.

59:37.833 --> 59:39.500
Tell me the truth,
do you like the zoo?

59:39.708 --> 59:41.083
Not really.

59:41.291 --> 59:44.375
Oh, that's so funny!
I don't like the zoo either.

59:44.708 --> 59:47.041
I was thinking
we go someplace else.

59:47.250 --> 59:48.875
And then maybe take the train.

59:49.083 --> 59:50.250
What do you think about that?

59:50.458 --> 59:51.541
Okay.

59:52.875 --> 59:55.083
This place we're going has
crayons and puzzles...

59:56.208 --> 59:58.000
Do you have your Metro Card?

59:58.166 --> 01:00:02.000
You don't have a Metro card?
What kind of New Yorker are you?

01:00:03.708 --> 01:00:06.041
Good morning everybody,
and welcome.

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:08.458
I'm a volunteer in the
Admissions Office this year.

01:00:08.666 --> 01:00:11.250
I hope to answer any questions
you might have,

01:00:11.458 --> 01:00:13.583
and maybe get to know you
a little bit, yeah?

01:00:13.791 --> 01:00:16.125
Don't worry, I'm not a spy!

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:21.041
I'm going to get started
by making sure everybody's here.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:25.333
First one, Mr. Mitchell
Mullen Vega, with Mary.

01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:27.125
Ah, it's you, hi!

01:00:27.416 --> 01:00:29.833
And Mrs. Rufus Martin?

01:00:31.125 --> 01:00:32.291
Are you the nanny?

01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:34.958
Come on.
Where we going?

01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:38.875
Oh, Ashley, hi!
You made it.

01:00:39.125 --> 01:00:40.666
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.

01:00:40.875 --> 01:00:42.583
Hi, Murphy!

01:00:42.791 --> 01:00:45.333
Remember me?
Good to see you!

01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:48.416
You're going to do great.
Mommy!

01:00:48.958 --> 01:00:51.083
They'll be toys.
No!

01:00:51.291 --> 01:00:53.833
You've got to go,
okay, okay, okay?

01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:54.666
Okay.

01:00:55.458 --> 01:00:56.333
Could you tell Mrs. Martin

01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:59.041
we're sorry she couldn't
make it here herself today.

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:02.166
We really require that
the parents be here.

01:01:02.416 --> 01:01:05.583
It's an important part of
our process to meet the parents.

01:01:05.791 --> 01:01:09.375
We call it 'Meet the Parents.'
We need to meet the parents.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:12.375
I'm here. Sorry, guys...
There you are, you alright?

01:01:12.583 --> 01:01:13.875
No, not really.

01:01:14.083 --> 01:01:15.541
It took us forever
to get up here.

01:01:17.125 --> 01:01:17.916
I wanted to get in there before
they started with the kids.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.125
I wanted to tell them
Murphy is tired

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:22.916
and she's been fighting
a cold, but...

01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:26.291
Never mind, they're not
exactly accommodating.

01:01:26.958 --> 01:01:28.166
What are doing here?

01:01:30.791 --> 01:01:31.708
I need to talk to you.

01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:34.500
Nan, just go have a seat
and help me run this session.

01:01:34.708 --> 01:01:36.708
Go out into the hall
for a second?

01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:37.541
Yeah.

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:39.750
Apologies, Lacey, sorry.

01:01:39.958 --> 01:01:42.041
We'll get right back
to you guys.

01:01:45.458 --> 01:01:46.083
Are you okay?

01:01:47.166 --> 01:01:47.791
Did you get my text?
I'm so sorry.

01:01:48.791 --> 01:01:49.958
Our lawyer came in
to talk with us.

01:01:50.166 --> 01:01:51.958
He scared the hell out of me.

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:53.166
Whenever he starts talking,

01:01:54.291 --> 01:01:54.958
I start thinking,
how did I get into this?

01:01:55.791 --> 01:01:56.625
He wants to talk percentage,

01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:58.791
likelihood of Steven
being convicted...

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.291
And confidentiality.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.500
That made me wonder,
did I say too much to you?

01:02:03.666 --> 01:02:05.458
It's been in the paper.

01:02:05.666 --> 01:02:07.500
Yeah, that's true.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.250
Yeah, so look...

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.041
I packed things up, okay?
It's done.

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:16.250
Nan, maybe we shouldn't talk
about this here.

01:02:16.458 --> 01:02:18.666
You're right, can I just say
this one thing?

01:02:18.875 --> 01:02:20.875
There are things at my house...

01:02:21.083 --> 01:02:23.166
that I can't live without.
I know.

01:02:23.375 --> 01:02:27.500
Things that I depend on
to live my life.

01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:31.458
What things, exactly?

01:02:32.291 --> 01:02:35.833
Yes, sure, I've got a list here.

01:02:36.083 --> 01:02:38.583
So have you booked
the storage facility?

01:02:39.125 --> 01:02:40.166
Not yet.

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:42.125
What's wrong?
Is something wrong?

01:02:42.333 --> 01:02:43.250
Nothing's wrong.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:44.958
So, I'll pick it up
at your place tonight?

01:02:45.666 --> 01:02:47.833
Yeah, cool, 11 o'clock.

01:02:48.958 --> 01:02:51.333
We'll have rented the facility
by then, right?

01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:52.333
Yes.

01:02:53.375 --> 01:02:53.958
I'll just bring it there
after work,

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:55.708
I'll have to stop at work.

01:02:55.916 --> 01:02:58.208
Work? At 11 o'clock at night?

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:00.833
Does your husband
know about this?

01:03:01.041 --> 01:03:02.833
My husband's a gambler.

01:03:03.041 --> 01:03:04.500
He could lose that
5 million bucks today

01:03:04.708 --> 01:03:05.916
and win it back on Thursday.

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.541
Then lose it again next week,
that's how he lives his life.

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.500
I'm not like that.

01:03:12.916 --> 01:03:14.708
It's killing me.

01:03:43.875 --> 01:03:45.625
Are you okay?

01:03:51.375 --> 01:03:53.208
What are you doing
with Sticker's kid?

01:03:53.416 --> 01:03:54.916
I took her for the test.

01:03:55.125 --> 01:03:56.541
And you're leaving her up there
by herself?

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.708
No, I'm leaving her with you.

01:03:58.916 --> 01:04:00.416
Just wait for her!
Take her home.

01:04:00.625 --> 01:04:02.000
I just called her mom, okay?

01:04:02.208 --> 01:04:04.208
She's on her way over,
it's fine.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.250
You're lying.

01:04:11.708 --> 01:04:13.208
Yeah, well, so are you.

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:14.958
How am I lying?

01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:16.625
Cause I work here?

01:04:17.666 --> 01:04:20.708
I like my job,
I'm good at it, alright?

01:04:21.041 --> 01:04:23.666
I understand the kids
that come through,

01:04:23.875 --> 01:04:25.125
I see their potential.

01:04:25.333 --> 01:04:27.791
Jesus, Ruth,
they're not your kids.

01:04:37.041 --> 01:04:40.083
You must hate yourself
for saying that.

01:04:57.291 --> 01:04:58.583
Mary?

01:04:59.083 --> 01:05:00.666
What are you making?

01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:02.500
Is that a face?

01:05:02.791 --> 01:05:04.333
Is that a face too?

01:05:04.666 --> 01:05:07.541
This one is her,
and this one is you.

01:05:08.125 --> 01:05:10.750
Is this the Admissions Office?
Mommy!

01:05:11.583 --> 01:05:14.125
Oh my god, Mary, you're here!

01:05:14.416 --> 01:05:17.208
I could not get away
from work right away.

01:05:17.541 --> 01:05:19.041
Get your stuff, let's go.

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:20.291
Sorry about the confusion.
This your sweater?

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.791
We spent a lot of time
with Mary.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.458
We'd like to tell you
how it went.

01:05:23.666 --> 01:05:26.333
How what went?
She's very perceptive.

01:05:26.541 --> 01:05:28.958
Imaginative. She's even
nice to the other kids.

01:05:29.166 --> 01:05:30.708
Okay, thank you!

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.458
Okay, c'mon.

01:05:44.958 --> 01:05:48.041
What the fuck is he doing?

01:05:49.125 --> 01:05:50.750
Yeah, 04,
that sounds about right,

01:05:50.958 --> 01:05:52.750
that's the year
we almost clinched it.

01:05:52.958 --> 01:05:53.416
Right.

01:05:54.416 --> 01:05:55.583
Yeah, but we lost
to that team...

01:05:55.791 --> 01:05:57.083
That team from Queens...

01:05:57.291 --> 01:05:58.041
The Devils.

01:05:58.375 --> 01:06:00.041
Yeah, shit!

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:03.250
Hey Jonny, here comes the popo.

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:20.041
Jonny!

01:06:20.333 --> 01:06:21.291
Hey.

01:06:22.041 --> 01:06:23.333
Where's Mary?
She's asleep.

01:06:23.541 --> 01:06:24.833
She spent the rest of the day
at work with me.

01:06:25.041 --> 01:06:25.791
I took her home.

01:06:26.666 --> 01:06:26.916
How did it go?
How she do?

01:06:28.083 --> 01:06:28.666
I'll kick your ass
for even asking me that.

01:06:29.541 --> 01:06:29.583
Come on, don't talk like that.

01:06:30.833 --> 01:06:32.625
Shut up, Jonny! Everyone knows.
Mary knows.

01:06:32.833 --> 01:06:35.500
You made a mistake. You were
supposed to take her to the zoo?

01:06:35.708 --> 01:06:38.166
He said he's sorry.
Shut up, Bobby!

01:06:38.791 --> 01:06:40.958
What I want to know is what
happens if they call her up

01:06:41.166 --> 01:06:42.625
and say she can go there.

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:44.000
What do you mean?

01:06:44.833 --> 01:06:46.875
I know her day care's hopeless.

01:06:47.083 --> 01:06:48.041
You're right.

01:06:49.208 --> 01:06:50.000
But she's the best kid
they've got.

01:06:50.208 --> 01:06:51.625
And they love here there.

01:06:51.833 --> 01:06:54.041
You put her into a school
like that, guess what.

01:06:55.791 --> 01:06:56.541
What?

01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:59.500
She doesn't get to be
the best anymore.

01:07:00.041 --> 01:07:02.791
What happens if she's lucky
on the day she gets in,

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.666
and then feels like the least
important kid in the room?

01:07:05.875 --> 01:07:08.583
Val, that's ridiculous,
she is fantastic.

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.958
And it's a good thing
they met you.

01:07:11.166 --> 01:07:13.875
It's part of their process.
They meet the mom.

01:07:14.125 --> 01:07:16.833
You don't think
Mary's good enough?

01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:19.041
Of course she's good enough!

01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:21.000
But I don't want her
to waste her whole life

01:07:21.208 --> 01:07:23.000
having to prove it.

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:28.333
Sticker's waiting for me,
I gotta go.

01:07:38.916 --> 01:07:40.416
Come on.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.208
This way?

01:08:14.208 --> 01:08:15.500
There it is.

01:08:15.916 --> 01:08:17.125
All done.

01:08:17.832 --> 01:08:19.750
A little more tape.

01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:28.250
Oh god, did I drop that one?

01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:30.875
Just take it for now.

01:08:33.791 --> 01:08:34.957
You alone?

01:08:36.375 --> 01:08:37.791
Of course I'm alone.
Steven's in the den working.

01:08:41.916 --> 01:08:42.541
What's going on?

01:08:43.582 --> 01:08:45.666
Jonny, this is Steven,
my husband.

01:08:45.875 --> 01:08:47.166
Steven, this is Jonny.

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:49.291
Great to meet you.

01:08:50.166 --> 01:08:52.291
Yeah, what's in the box?

01:08:55.125 --> 01:08:56.457
You didn't tell him?

01:08:58.832 --> 01:09:00.041
Full of candy.

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:03.291
That's a lot of candy.
Yeah...

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.500
We really packed it in there.

01:09:05.832 --> 01:09:07.000
Hmmm...

01:09:09.916 --> 01:09:11.541
What's it for?

01:09:11.916 --> 01:09:14.875
It's your daughter's donation
to the Halloween Fair.

01:09:15.082 --> 01:09:19.125
Thirty pounds of candy in there
to be auctioned off at school.

01:09:22.457 --> 01:09:24.541
We'd better decorate it
for Halloween

01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:26.957
or else no one's gonna bother
to bid on it.

01:09:28.041 --> 01:09:29.250
What do you have in mind?

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.375
I'm running out of ideas,
as my wife probably explained.

01:09:34.582 --> 01:09:36.791
I never said anything to him!
Really?

01:09:37.041 --> 01:09:39.375
Who's idea was it? Dorset's?
Big box of fuckin' candy.

01:09:39.541 --> 01:09:42.000
No, it was supposed to be
a surprise for her.

01:09:42.207 --> 01:09:44.750
And we haven't told
Murphy either.

01:09:45.832 --> 01:09:47.416
Know what, actually,

01:09:47.625 --> 01:09:50.082
I do have an idea
about this fucking box.

01:09:50.291 --> 01:09:51.582
You go get some wire hangers.

01:09:51.791 --> 01:09:53.207
We'll put some
nylon stockings over it.

01:09:53.416 --> 01:09:55.208
It'll look like
a ghost, very scary.

01:09:55.416 --> 01:09:58.666
Paint it black, it'll look
like it's floating, right?

01:10:02.958 --> 01:10:05.333
Are you still working in there,
or are you done for the night?

01:10:08.416 --> 01:10:09.458
No...

01:10:10.291 --> 01:10:11.541
I'm not done for the night.

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:14.041
I just came in to get some ice.

01:10:21.166 --> 01:10:22.291
Yeah.

01:10:24.166 --> 01:10:25.333
Heavy.

01:10:25.625 --> 01:10:27.666
Yeah, I know,
I just kept adding things.

01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:29.458
Here, keep this one too.

01:10:29.666 --> 01:10:32.500
Okay, quick,
out this way, remember?

01:10:45.666 --> 01:10:47.291
How was dinner?

01:11:44.083 --> 01:11:45.875
So, how'd it go?

01:11:46.166 --> 01:11:48.458
Fine, just fine.
Get the duffel bags, hurry up.

01:11:48.666 --> 01:11:50.250
I gotta get the ladder.

01:12:27.916 --> 01:12:29.750
You look like
something went wrong.

01:12:29.958 --> 01:12:31.250
Her husband was there.

01:12:31.458 --> 01:12:32.833
How did you get this stuff out?

01:12:34.333 --> 01:12:36.458
It was already in the box.
I said it was Halloween candy.

01:12:36.833 --> 01:12:38.625
No way he believed that.

01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:41.125
Yeah, I know.

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:43.833
We got a bunch over here,
how many do you want?

01:12:44.041 --> 01:12:46.041
Two should be good.
Okay.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.833
Look who's here.

01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:56.833
Come in.

01:12:58.166 --> 01:13:00.458
Amaad said you guys
would be over here.

01:13:01.625 --> 01:13:02.916
Did he?

01:13:04.666 --> 01:13:06.041
You going somewhere?

01:13:06.791 --> 01:13:08.833
Yeah, I'm going to work.

01:13:10.041 --> 01:13:12.291
What is all this stuff?

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.416
Leave us alone, Ruth.

01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:19.291
I see it's stolen property.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:20.625
None of it's stolen actually..

01:13:20.833 --> 01:13:22.166
Yeah, what are you gonna
do with it?

01:13:23.708 --> 01:13:24.083
Bobby's bringing it to me
at work. I'll keep it safe.

01:13:24.625 --> 01:13:25.375
Don't worry.

01:13:26.416 --> 01:13:28.208
This is how
you do things, Jonny.

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.625
Breaking and entering
people's houses from the back.

01:13:30.833 --> 01:13:32.625
From the water side.

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:35.041
Yeah, well, it always works.

01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:38.041
People don't lock up from that
side of the house, they should.

01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:39.666
I don't like that idea anymore.

01:13:39.875 --> 01:13:41.375
This has nothing to do with you.

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:43.500
I really wish that were true.

01:13:43.958 --> 01:13:45.375
Make it true.

01:13:45.791 --> 01:13:46.791
You're good at that.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.083
Jonny, go, I'll do this.

01:13:49.541 --> 01:13:50.791
C'mon.

01:13:53.791 --> 01:13:56.291
Get to work,
I'll take care of it.

01:14:07.333 --> 01:14:10.666
What are you doing this for?
I said I'd help him.

01:14:10.916 --> 01:14:12.958
You can sign off on this?

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:15.583
And this bullshit of
being involved with Jonny

01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:17.791
and trouble all the time?

01:14:19.458 --> 01:14:21.708
You got a better idea?

01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:24.208
No.

01:14:26.416 --> 01:14:27.833
I don't know.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.375
I know, I know...

01:14:33.583 --> 01:14:34.958
We will find you.

01:14:35.166 --> 01:14:37.166
Yes, 3:45, we won't be late...

01:14:43.416 --> 01:14:45.000
No mistakes.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.666
Hello, coming from the airport?

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:07.291
No, these are the DJ's bags.

01:15:07.583 --> 01:15:10.208
That's good to know,
I'll give you a claim check.

01:15:10.416 --> 01:15:12.375
I don't need a claim check.

01:15:12.916 --> 01:15:14.083
Just take it, huh?

01:15:14.291 --> 01:15:15.083
Fine.

01:15:16.208 --> 01:15:18.083
Have a nice night.
I'm not staying.

01:15:22.208 --> 01:15:23.791
Hi? Hello?

01:15:56.375 --> 01:15:57.791
I know how to party...

01:16:17.333 --> 01:16:18.250
Here you go.

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:34.250
Fill it up, man.

01:16:34.458 --> 01:16:35.583
What the hell
are you guys doing?

01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:36.541
What does it look like we're
doing?

01:16:37.958 --> 01:16:38.916
Fill up the bag with
whatever you got back there!

01:16:40.083 --> 01:16:41.375
Do it now!
Don't fuck with us, Pops!

01:16:41.958 --> 01:16:43.416
What did you call me?
Do it!

01:16:43.625 --> 01:16:46.458
You guys were supposed to wait
till it cleared out at 3:45.

01:16:46.666 --> 01:16:47.958
What time is it?
It's time!

01:16:48.166 --> 01:16:49.916
It's not time.
We were ready!

01:16:50.125 --> 01:16:51.125
And it's...

01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:52.416
Shit!

01:16:52.625 --> 01:16:55.083
No, it's not, it's 2:45.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.500
It's now or never.

01:16:56.708 --> 01:16:58.291
All I got are coats,
boys, sorry.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:01.750
We don't want coats!
We want laptops and backpacks.

01:17:02.041 --> 01:17:03.166
I don't want any trouble.

01:17:03.375 --> 01:17:04.833
Where's my tips, man?

01:17:06.625 --> 01:17:07.875
Here you go.

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:11.416
Alright. What about
those duffle bags back there?

01:17:15.916 --> 01:17:17.083
Get the fuck out of here!

01:17:22.583 --> 01:17:24.625
Hey guys,
they just stole some bags.

01:17:24.916 --> 01:17:26.625
Yeah, I'm alright.

01:17:28.875 --> 01:17:29.666
You alright?

01:17:53.375 --> 01:17:55.166
Hey, what's that?

01:17:55.833 --> 01:17:58.500
Jonny's tips.
Alright, get out of here.

01:18:31.958 --> 01:18:33.291
Hey, it's me.

01:18:35.958 --> 01:18:37.500
Something happened.

01:18:38.666 --> 01:18:39.500
You okay?

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:43.750
Yes, I'm okay, but there was...

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.000
an incident at work.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.041
What?

01:18:49.541 --> 01:18:51.708
I got held up.

01:19:03.458 --> 01:19:07.000
Ahh, the cops are here,
I gotta go.

01:19:15.416 --> 01:19:16.750
Fuck!

01:19:46.041 --> 01:19:46.916
Hey.

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:48.458
What's up, buddy?

01:19:48.666 --> 01:19:49.583
Wanna check it out?
Yeah.

01:19:49.791 --> 01:19:50.750
It's in the trunk.

01:20:05.958 --> 01:20:07.250
What's going on?

01:20:12.166 --> 01:20:14.583
Why is there candy in the bag?

01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:26.333
Jonny?

01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:30.125
Oh, man!

01:20:31.375 --> 01:20:32.791
Can you tell me
what's going on here?

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.208
Why is there candy in the bags?

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:48.875
Hey, what's up?

01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:50.583
Slow down, Jonny.

01:20:51.125 --> 01:20:52.375
No, I'm not.

01:20:53.833 --> 01:20:56.333
Alright, the candy's a gift.
Let's call it even.

01:21:02.916 --> 01:21:05.541
What the fuck just happened?
I don't know.

01:21:24.666 --> 01:21:25.291
Ruth...

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.541
Hi.
Hi.

01:21:29.458 --> 01:21:31.333
What's in the duffle, Duffy?

01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:32.333
Money.

01:21:34.583 --> 01:21:35.791
How much money?

01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:39.208
Two and a half million bucks.

01:21:41.541 --> 01:21:45.208
Why don't you come inside
and we'll sit down for a minute?

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.125
Why are you dressed?

01:22:28.541 --> 01:22:30.333
It's all good, Nan, relax.

01:22:30.708 --> 01:22:33.083
Did you sleep out here?
Jesus, you must be exhausted.

01:22:33.291 --> 01:22:34.500
Wait...

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:36.083
What's all good?

01:22:36.291 --> 01:22:38.375
Dan negotiated a plea.

01:22:38.583 --> 01:22:39.458
It's over.

01:22:39.833 --> 01:22:40.666
No.

01:22:40.875 --> 01:22:41.333
Yes!

01:22:42.125 --> 01:22:42.708
Charges have been dropped.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:44.333
There's going to be penalties,

01:22:45.416 --> 01:22:46.583
but at least
I'm back in the game.

01:22:49.291 --> 01:22:51.083
You don't really seem
all that happy for me,

01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:52.875
so I'm gonna go.

01:22:53.083 --> 01:22:54.458
Is everything alright?

01:22:54.958 --> 01:22:56.250
Hmm...

01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:57.875
Steven...

01:23:00.583 --> 01:23:02.166
We have to talk.

01:23:03.791 --> 01:23:06.666
Okay, Heidi,
good but no, no, no...

01:23:06.875 --> 01:23:09.666
What you're trying
to convey to George,

01:23:09.875 --> 01:23:11.500
meaning Jennifer, is that

01:23:11.708 --> 01:23:13.541
you don't like the changes...

01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:28.291
Excuse me, hi, can I help you?

01:23:30.541 --> 01:23:33.041
I'm sorry,
I got a little turned around.

01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:35.500
I'm getting out of your way.

01:23:38.416 --> 01:23:39.666
You knew I'd come after you.

01:23:39.875 --> 01:23:41.125
I figured
you'd find your way here.

01:23:41.333 --> 01:23:42.416
Know what I'm going to say?

01:23:42.625 --> 01:23:44.416
Probably.
Go ahead and say it.

01:23:44.625 --> 01:23:48.583
If you don't want to help me,
don't help me, but don't rob me.

01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:52.083
Girls, it's all good,
in silence, okay?

01:23:57.375 --> 01:23:59.416
I didn't rob you.
Don't lie to me!

01:23:59.625 --> 01:24:02.125
They can't report this
to anyone.

01:24:02.333 --> 01:24:04.458
And I'm giving half of it
back to you. That's helping you!

01:24:04.666 --> 01:24:07.958
Half? Both halves are mine.
Well, that's my offer.

01:24:08.166 --> 01:24:11.500
You're making an offer?
My final offer.

01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:26.625
473-5394.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.791
You know what that is?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.250
My phone number in high school.

01:24:32.125 --> 01:24:34.500
Now it's the PIN to my ATM.

01:24:37.708 --> 01:24:39.708
That's too many numbers.

01:24:40.583 --> 01:24:42.875
Whenever I go to the bank
to get 20 bucks,

01:24:43.083 --> 01:24:45.750
I think about you
and I call your number.

01:24:46.291 --> 01:24:48.083
What does that tell you?

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:50.541
Now I can clean you out...

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:53.958
Unless you change the PIN.

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.500
I'll never change it.

01:25:23.875 --> 01:25:25.291
Fuckers!

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:28.333
Fucking...!
Shut up, you fuckers!

01:25:30.958 --> 01:25:32.458
Why'd you do that?

01:25:32.666 --> 01:25:34.791
What the fuck, you fuckers...!

01:25:35.375 --> 01:25:37.250
Idiot! You're an idiot!

01:25:38.458 --> 01:25:40.541
Shut up...!

01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:42.000
Fuckers!

01:25:42.375 --> 01:25:44.000
FUCK YOU!

01:25:44.208 --> 01:25:45.666
Fuck you!

01:25:46.291 --> 01:25:48.125
I fucking hate this...

01:26:20.416 --> 01:26:21.833
This is good, thanks.

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:27.583
What the hell is it now?

01:26:27.791 --> 01:26:29.250
First you lose your shirt
in a robbery

01:26:29.458 --> 01:26:30.541
that had nothing to do with us,

01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:32.916
except that
it was set up for us.

01:26:33.291 --> 01:26:35.541
Is this about Murphy or Dorset?

01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:38.291
I don't know.
Steven, I made a mistake.

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:40.583
This could be about the robbery.
There might be a problem.

01:26:40.791 --> 01:26:41.625
Yeah, no shit!

01:26:42.708 --> 01:26:43.541
You removed property
from our vault.

01:26:44.875 --> 01:26:45.291
The only thing worse than
being robbed would be

01:26:46.166 --> 01:26:46.958
intercepted by Federal agents.

01:26:48.416 --> 01:26:49.583
Is that what this is about?
I don't know, maybe.

01:26:49.791 --> 01:26:51.833
I had to talk to someone.

01:26:52.666 --> 01:26:55.291
Stop.
Who did you talk to about this?

01:26:57.083 --> 01:26:59.291
I think it might be a problem,

01:26:59.458 --> 01:27:03.125
the extent to which Guy understands
the implications of what I did.

01:27:03.333 --> 01:27:05.666
Of, for fuck's sake,
Nan, for real?

01:27:05.875 --> 01:27:08.125
I don't want to go to jail.
Okay.

01:27:08.333 --> 01:27:10.583
You're not going
to jail, alright?

01:27:10.791 --> 01:27:14.083
Steven, what did I do?
We're gonna figure this out.

01:27:14.666 --> 01:27:17.208
First of all,
you didn't trust me.

01:27:17.458 --> 01:27:19.666
Not just you I didn't trust.
I didn't trust everybody else.

01:27:19.875 --> 01:27:21.833
You're not that well-liked.

01:27:23.666 --> 01:27:26.875
I hate to tell you this,
neither are you.

01:27:28.458 --> 01:27:29.791
Okay.

01:27:37.958 --> 01:27:39.625
Steven, Nan...

01:27:39.833 --> 01:27:41.291
Thank you, girls, very much.

01:27:41.458 --> 01:27:45.208
What are all these cookies?
Is it about Murphy?

01:27:45.458 --> 01:27:47.041
We actually have news
about Murphy.

01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:49.333
We're not sharing that
until after the holidays.

01:27:49.541 --> 01:27:51.125
She's in.
Guy, come on...

01:27:51.333 --> 01:27:53.500
But I know that's not why
you did this.

01:27:53.708 --> 01:27:55.125
Why we did what?

01:27:55.333 --> 01:27:56.541
The gift.

01:27:58.208 --> 01:27:59.750
We've never received a gift like
this, anonymous or otherwise.

01:27:59.958 --> 01:28:02.916
The number that you came up with
will actually pay

01:28:03.125 --> 01:28:05.583
for five more girls
in Murphy's class.

01:28:05.791 --> 01:28:07.458
What? Excuse me?

01:28:07.833 --> 01:28:10.166
Can we clarify what you just
said, Mr. Brinckerhoff?

01:28:10.375 --> 01:28:13.083
Of course!
Five more girls...

01:28:13.291 --> 01:28:14.833
Through Grade 12,
all the way up.

01:28:15.041 --> 01:28:17.291
Miss Duffy has run the numbers,

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.708
and it looks like we'll
have a little left over

01:28:19.916 --> 01:28:21.875
to use at our discretion.

01:28:22.208 --> 01:28:22.916
Excuse me?

01:28:24.041 --> 01:28:26.541
We called it $35,000
a year per child,

01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:28.041
that's a conservative estimate,

01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:30.041
for 13 years and 5 girls.

01:28:30.250 --> 01:28:30.625
So that's...

01:28:31.166 --> 01:28:33.000
...$2,275,000

01:28:33.208 --> 01:28:34.583
That's what I got also.

01:28:34.833 --> 01:28:37.250
Including activity fees
and lunch.

01:28:39.708 --> 01:28:41.958
I don't know
what is happening right now.

01:28:42.583 --> 01:28:44.208
I'm thanking you.

01:28:44.458 --> 01:28:45.916
Accept my thanks.

01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:56.291
I think what Steven's saying
is that

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.791
we have a lot
to be grateful for.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.583
And a lot to give back.

01:29:00.791 --> 01:29:01.500
To us?

01:29:01.708 --> 01:29:02.458
Yes.

01:29:03.541 --> 01:29:05.750
I don't know
what Guy is thinking,

01:29:05.916 --> 01:29:10.125
but I'm concerned it might not
be as simple as we'd like.

01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:12.625
I mean, it's...

01:29:12.833 --> 01:29:15.166
It's wonderful,
that goes without saying,

01:29:15.375 --> 01:29:17.791
but I don't know what
it means for us, as a school...

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.500
It would mean that 5 more kids,
5 more families,

01:29:21.708 --> 01:29:23.875
would have more control
over their future

01:29:24.083 --> 01:29:26.250
than they otherwise
would have had.

01:29:28.666 --> 01:29:30.083
I don't know we can take it.

01:29:30.291 --> 01:29:32.250
I hope that's not
insulting to you.

01:29:32.458 --> 01:29:34.833
No, you're not
insulting me at all.

01:29:39.333 --> 01:29:41.958
Look, the class
is already filled.

01:29:42.166 --> 01:29:43.666
But this is a new opportunity.

01:29:43.875 --> 01:29:45.958
We have many great opportunities
here. This is one.

01:29:46.125 --> 01:29:48.250
It might not be the right one.

01:29:48.458 --> 01:29:49.958
Guy, what are you thinking?

01:29:50.166 --> 01:29:52.958
Can we give you some time
to calculate the impact?

01:29:53.416 --> 01:29:54.500
What do you say, Duffy?

01:29:54.708 --> 01:29:56.500
About the impact
and the complication

01:29:56.708 --> 01:29:57.916
a gift like this can create?

01:29:58.125 --> 01:29:58.916
It sounds like you've already

01:29:59.916 --> 01:30:01.333
filled the class up
for this year.

01:30:01.708 --> 01:30:02.958
What can we do?

01:30:06.541 --> 01:30:08.791
I could go buy five more chairs.

01:30:09.416 --> 01:30:11.166
That's exactly what
I was thinking.

01:30:11.375 --> 01:30:12.500
We accept.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.458
We'll send those tax deduction
forms to you right away.

01:30:15.666 --> 01:30:18.583
That is not going to be
an insignificant amount.

01:30:18.791 --> 01:30:20.208
But you both know that already

01:30:20.416 --> 01:30:23.083
cause you both
have degrees in finance.

01:30:29.458 --> 01:30:31.375
I appreciate your...

01:30:32.083 --> 01:30:33.791
contribution.

01:30:41.083 --> 01:30:43.208
Where do you want it to go?
The middle.

01:30:43.416 --> 01:30:44.375
You want it to go...?

01:30:44.583 --> 01:30:46.291
Can I talk to
my daughter, please?

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:47.416
You want it to go
right in the middle?

01:30:47.625 --> 01:30:48.541
Yes!

01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:50.250
You want it here?

01:30:51.041 --> 01:30:54.375
Okay, good, is this good?
Yes, but make it smooth.

01:30:55.083 --> 01:30:57.125
No, down a little bit.
Down?

01:30:57.333 --> 01:30:57.916
Yeah, there?

01:30:58.333 --> 01:30:59.333
Yes!

01:31:02.708 --> 01:31:04.791
Smoother...

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.208
That is perfect.

01:31:09.958 --> 01:31:11.458
I mean it's a little...

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:14.125
It could a little lower.

01:31:14.333 --> 01:31:16.333
What is that, a barbie doll?

01:31:20.166 --> 01:31:21.083
Hey...

01:31:21.291 --> 01:31:22.750
My big doll!

01:31:28.666 --> 01:31:30.000
I don't understand
what the problem is.

01:31:30.208 --> 01:31:31.333
Can we sit here?

01:31:32.166 --> 01:31:33.625
Couple of menus, please.

01:31:33.833 --> 01:31:35.708
You say you're taking a chance.

01:31:36.375 --> 01:31:39.750
It's 45 minutes,
it's parked on a side street.

01:31:39.958 --> 01:31:42.000
It's a bad idea.
It's a good idea.

01:31:42.208 --> 01:31:44.875
Who parks a brand new
Audi sport on the street?

01:31:45.083 --> 01:31:47.166
Everybody.
Everybody?

01:31:47.458 --> 01:31:49.666
Hey, don't look at them.

01:31:49.916 --> 01:31:51.333
Look at me.

01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:52.833
I am.

01:31:55.291 --> 01:31:56.666
Congratulations.

01:31:56.875 --> 01:31:58.541
Non-interim.

01:31:59.333 --> 01:32:01.000
I got you something.

01:32:01.291 --> 01:32:03.583
I hope
you didn't spend too much.

01:32:08.583 --> 01:32:10.250
Those are real.

01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:12.916
I love it.
Really.

01:32:13.125 --> 01:32:14.333
No box?

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.458
No box.

01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:18.083
It's perfect.

01:32:18.291 --> 01:32:20.166
It's not perfect,
but it's for you.

01:32:21.208 --> 01:32:23.500
I wouldn't wear it at school.

01:32:26.250 --> 01:32:28.583
I wish I had something for you.

01:32:30.416 --> 01:32:32.166
You're what I want.

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:33.666
Yeah...

01:32:33.916 --> 01:32:35.875
And your fifty-percent share.

01:32:39.208 --> 01:32:41.125
Yeah, I put all that
into Treasury Bills.

01:32:41.333 --> 01:32:42.208
You did?

01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:44.041
Good choice.

01:32:45.125 --> 01:32:47.041
I put them into a trust
for the kid.

01:32:47.250 --> 01:32:48.791
He gets it when he's 21.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.375
I was gonna
give it all to him now,

01:32:50.583 --> 01:32:51.625
but that seemed risky...

01:32:51.833 --> 01:32:53.083
I don't wanna...
You check, sir.

01:32:53.666 --> 01:32:55.500
I don't want him to be
the little

01:32:55.708 --> 01:32:57.625
rich kid in the house,
with his brothers,

01:32:57.833 --> 01:32:59.375
know what I mean?

01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:02.625
That's what you've been doing?

01:33:04.041 --> 01:33:05.666
How did you do that?

01:33:05.875 --> 01:33:07.541
I have my ways.

01:33:08.375 --> 01:33:10.125
I have people.

01:33:24.583 --> 01:33:27.125
I might be broke but he's not.

01:33:30.250 --> 01:33:32.166
Alright, are we ready to order?
Any questions?

01:33:36.958 --> 01:33:38.458
I think we should go.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.083
Okay.

01:33:42.375 --> 01:33:43.541
Now.

01:33:45.166 --> 01:33:47.916
I would like the ginger
vinaigrette on the side.

01:33:48.125 --> 01:33:51.625
And the crispy wantons,
leave those off completely.

01:33:53.125 --> 01:33:54.291
Hey...

01:33:54.916 --> 01:33:56.458
Don't leave me again.

01:33:56.833 --> 01:33:58.250
I won't.

01:34:06.458 --> 01:34:09.166
I put them here.
But you have your keys?

01:34:09.375 --> 01:34:10.958
I thought I put it right here.

01:34:11.166 --> 01:34:11.791
I don't know.

01:34:13.208 --> 01:34:15.125
Stop your yoga hands,
stand up and check your pants!

01:34:15.333 --> 01:34:18.625
I don't have the key.
You never let me have the key.

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:29.916
May I?

01:34:45.458 --> 01:34:47.333
These shades are very nice.

01:34:50.250 --> 01:34:51.458
Like them?
Yeah.

01:34:51.666 --> 01:34:53.125
They're for you.

01:34:53.333 --> 01:34:54.166
Thank you.

01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:55.833
They're perfect.

01:34:56.041 --> 01:34:57.416
They're not perfect.

01:35:07.958 --> 01:35:10.416
Okay, they're perfect.
