WEBVTT

00:13.100 --> 00:15.102
You're early.

00:15.145 --> 00:17.104
I would imagine
you'd approve of that.

00:17.147 --> 00:19.715
I do.

00:19.758 --> 00:22.065
So what does the Entity
want from me this time?

00:22.109 --> 00:23.849
Cyanide pills?

00:23.893 --> 00:27.505
Oh, David,
I never tire of your teasing.

00:31.596 --> 00:32.728
This.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.783
What is it, a time bomb?

00:44.827 --> 00:47.743
Yes, just wind it up.
No, it's a toy.

00:47.786 --> 00:50.615
That's all.
It's just a toy.

00:50.659 --> 00:53.444
We need you to slip it
into a room and leave it.

00:53.488 --> 00:54.967
For surveillance?

00:55.011 --> 00:56.795
Something like that.

00:59.146 --> 01:02.323
- So, do I wait for a call?
- No.

01:02.366 --> 01:06.153
You will be getting an invite
to a dinner.

01:06.196 --> 01:09.199
When you're at that dinner,
we need you to excuse yourself

01:09.243 --> 01:10.896
and go to the restroom.

01:10.940 --> 01:14.422
But instead, you will enter
a room neighboring it,

01:14.465 --> 01:17.903
and you will put that toy
in that room.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.299
One of the other assessors
you work with--

01:22.343 --> 01:25.172
her name is Kristen Bouchard.

01:26.825 --> 01:28.871
She has a daughter
named Lexis.

01:28.914 --> 01:33.093
Kristen will be the one
inviting you to a dinner,

01:33.136 --> 01:36.096
and you will be putting that toy
in Lexis' room.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.934
You said yes
to the Friends of the Vatican.

01:48.978 --> 01:51.154
I didn't agree
to betray a friend.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.156
And betray a friend about
her fucking daughter?!

01:55.811 --> 01:57.813
My goodness, swearing.

01:57.856 --> 02:00.816
You were the one who discovered

02:00.859 --> 02:03.297
the demonic connection
to RSM Fertility.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.907
In fact, you keep
asking me about

02:04.950 --> 02:07.257
my progress in attacking it.

02:07.301 --> 02:11.261
This... is my progress.

02:13.220 --> 02:16.788
Lexis Bouchard is a product
of RSM Fertility.

02:16.832 --> 02:19.835
She is being groomed
by demonic forces

02:19.878 --> 02:21.663
to replace
one of the aging sigils

02:21.706 --> 02:24.144
of the Poveglia Codex.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.450
She needs to be observed,

02:26.494 --> 02:29.279
and eventually stopped.

02:29.323 --> 02:33.327
You're talking about
an 11-year-old.

02:33.370 --> 02:34.719
The daughter of a friend.

02:34.763 --> 02:39.071
Those who are evil
start as children, David.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.464
Hitler was a child.

02:40.508 --> 02:43.206
Mao, Stalin.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.730
They were loved,
they had toys.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.125
And they looked like Lexis.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.956
David...

02:53.999 --> 02:57.438
I will insist on one thing.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.440
Do not say anything
about this conversation

02:59.483 --> 03:01.442
to Kristen or her daughter.

03:15.804 --> 03:19.242
They're all pedophiles,
every single one of them.

03:19.286 --> 03:22.202
You know, they take these kids
and they peel off their skin

03:22.245 --> 03:23.855
so fast it's like
they got zippers.

03:23.899 --> 03:26.641
- Hmm.
- And the thing is

03:26.684 --> 03:28.773
no one cares about this;
it's just me.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.993
Hmm.

03:31.036 --> 03:34.214
That is a really scary thing
to imagine, Larry.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.955
I'm not imagining it.
This is all completely true.

03:36.999 --> 03:40.089
In order
to pull something like this off,

03:40.132 --> 03:42.526
there would have to be
millions of people

03:42.570 --> 03:44.528
- keeping it a secret, right?
- Evil people

03:44.572 --> 03:46.269
- do evil things.
- What are we doing here?

03:46.313 --> 03:47.401
I can't explain how

03:47.444 --> 03:48.750
- they do it all.
- Talking to him.

03:48.793 --> 03:51.448
You're a liar. You're lying.

03:51.492 --> 03:54.277
You're lying to everyone and
you're part of the problem, man.

03:57.802 --> 04:00.022
Okay.
Okay, thank you, thank you.

04:00.065 --> 04:02.416
Most of your conversations
with loved ones

04:02.459 --> 04:04.200
will never escalate like that.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.593
Uh, thank you, Larry.

04:09.988 --> 04:12.774
Deprogramming.

04:12.817 --> 04:15.603
It has gotten harder
in the last half decade,

04:15.646 --> 04:19.650
mostly because religious cults
have been joined by

04:19.694 --> 04:22.479
political ones.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.264
My guess is that
most of you are here today

04:24.307 --> 04:27.528
because a family member
has become absorbed in QAnon.

04:30.182 --> 04:31.575
Take care. Ah.

04:31.619 --> 04:32.881
Father Acosta.

04:32.924 --> 04:34.883
Very interesting talk, Doctor.

04:34.926 --> 04:37.059
- Oh, thanks.
- This is Kristen and Ben.

04:37.102 --> 04:38.060
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.540
Pleasure.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.150
- You needed our help?
- Yeah.

04:41.193 --> 04:42.499
Doesn't seem like
you'd need anything

04:42.543 --> 04:45.154
with 500 successful
interventions.

04:45.197 --> 04:50.028
Yes, business has been
oddly busy lately, but...

04:50.072 --> 04:54.685
I've come across something
that I can't understand.

04:54.729 --> 04:57.775
- What's that?
- A young man,

04:57.819 --> 05:01.257
24 years old,
Owen Venegas...

05:01.301 --> 05:03.172
His parents sent me out
on an intervention

05:03.215 --> 05:04.434
about a month ago.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.783
His girlfriend got him
wrapped up

05:05.827 --> 05:06.958
in a cult upstate.

05:07.002 --> 05:08.786
The Yeshua People?

05:08.830 --> 05:11.920
Um, it's new. It's caught on
with some celebrities

05:11.963 --> 05:13.574
and New Age folks.

05:13.617 --> 05:16.968
They live in the woods,
talk about Jesus on earth.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.405
Living and farming together.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.668
And?

05:20.711 --> 05:22.322
Well, with deprogramming,

05:22.365 --> 05:24.367
you break down
a subject's identity

05:24.411 --> 05:29.067
in order to build it up again,
but with Owen...

05:29.111 --> 05:30.547
something happened.

05:30.591 --> 05:33.985
I don't think
he's brainwashed anymore.

05:34.029 --> 05:37.032
I think he's possessed.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.687
I didn't know you believed
in possession.

05:39.730 --> 05:42.080
I don't.

05:42.124 --> 05:45.780
But I believe
the evidence of my eyes,

05:45.823 --> 05:49.523
and this one scares me.

05:51.568 --> 05:53.309
You want to meet him?

06:41.879 --> 06:43.577
Don't get within two feet.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.535
You'll see a line
we've drawn on the floor.

07:15.173 --> 07:17.611
Hi, Owen.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.351
I'm Father Acosta.

07:23.138 --> 07:25.314
Do you know why
you're here, Owen?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.231
Can you hear me?

07:29.274 --> 07:32.016
We've been asked to examine you.

07:40.372 --> 07:41.461
Kristen.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.387
Did he do all this?

07:55.431 --> 07:58.390
Yes. Once it takes over,
he really loses it.

07:58.434 --> 08:01.045
What takes over?

08:01.089 --> 08:03.657
Um, he-he seems dehydrated.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.615
We give him water
every 20 minutes.

08:05.659 --> 08:08.836
- He's been here a month?
- Yes.

08:08.879 --> 08:11.055
Okay, you need a doctor
in here.

08:11.099 --> 08:13.536
- I am a doctor.
- No, a medical doctor.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.407
I am a medical doctor.
Do you want to see the diploma?

08:15.451 --> 08:18.541
Doctor, he needs to be
in a hospital.

08:18.585 --> 08:19.716
- You tied him to the bed?
- Yes.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.892
- Why?
- So that he doesn't

08:21.936 --> 08:23.503
hurt himself or us.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.287
Don't you do the same thing
with an exorcism?

08:25.330 --> 08:26.897
Well, exorcisms don't last
for a month.

08:26.941 --> 08:28.638
Some do. David?

08:31.075 --> 08:35.384
Okay, you-you cannot just
kidnap somebody and hold them.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.430
These are signatures
from his parents

08:38.474 --> 08:39.823
granting us permission
to hold him.

08:39.867 --> 08:43.218
And this is a court order
granting his parents

08:43.261 --> 08:46.003
guardianship over Owen until
he's returned to his right mind.

08:46.047 --> 08:49.180
The parents are in the hall
if you want to talk to them.

08:49.224 --> 08:52.706
<i>Potesne me audire?</i>

08:52.749 --> 08:55.143
<i>Quis es?</i>

08:56.710 --> 08:59.539
<i>- Egerene es.</i>

08:59.582 --> 09:01.062
<i>Quod nomen tibi est?</i>

09:04.500 --> 09:06.676
You've neglected your lessons,
David.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.940
<i>Altus, alta, altum.</i>

09:09.984 --> 09:12.813
<i>Alti, altae, alta.</i>

09:12.856 --> 09:14.597
What do you want with Owen?

09:14.641 --> 09:16.251
Why are you doing this?

09:16.294 --> 09:18.209
Come closer.

09:18.253 --> 09:20.124
Why?

09:20.168 --> 09:22.910
Because I need
to whisper it to you.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.915
David.

09:27.958 --> 09:31.135
Closer, David. Closer.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.620
Okay.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.579
Now what do you want?

09:50.590 --> 09:53.201
Our golden retriever.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.116
That's what we used to call him.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.813
Just the happiest kid ever.

09:56.857 --> 09:57.988
A real idealist.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.207
Wanted to join the Peace Corps.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.730
That was his plan.

10:00.774 --> 10:02.602
That's why, when he told us
about the farm,

10:02.645 --> 10:05.387
we thought it was just another
one of his volunteer things.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.649
How did he hear about the farm?

10:06.693 --> 10:07.694
From his girlfriend Lilli.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.523
Where is Lilli?

10:11.567 --> 10:13.700
Still with the Yeshua People
on the farm.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.049
Does she know
what's happening here?

10:15.092 --> 10:16.659
No.
She resisted our intervention.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.835
Your intervention being...

10:18.879 --> 10:21.751
Approved by the authorities
in emergency cases like this.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.449
Do you have a photo of Lilli?

10:24.493 --> 10:25.581
Yes, I do.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.236
Has your son ever
studied Latin,

10:28.279 --> 10:30.107
Mr. and Mrs. Venegas?

10:30.151 --> 10:32.066
Uh, no.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.113
I'm gonna suggest
that Father Luke,

10:36.157 --> 10:37.941
one of our exorcists,
come later today

10:37.985 --> 10:41.205
to look at Owen,
if I have your permission.

10:44.295 --> 10:47.603
- Anything?
- Well...

10:47.647 --> 10:49.083
not much of a web presence.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.562
Just some testimonials

10:50.606 --> 10:53.304
- from a soap opera star.
- What is this?

10:53.348 --> 10:56.220
These are new margaritas.

10:56.264 --> 10:59.223
- They're, uh, colorful.
- Mm-hmm.

10:59.267 --> 11:00.660
They got Pop Rocks
around the rim.

11:03.010 --> 11:06.187
Yep, those are Pop Rocks.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.755
Oh, here's something.
So, "The People of Yeshua,

11:08.798 --> 11:10.452
a land with no locks."

11:10.495 --> 11:13.020
They're having sunrise services
tomorrow morning,

11:13.063 --> 11:14.456
and the public is welcome.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.850
That's us, right? The public.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.899
Oh, God! Why?

11:22.943 --> 11:25.249
Okay, what are you guys
doing tonight?

11:25.293 --> 11:28.122
I have a very busy life.
Nothing.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.298
You're both invited to dinner.

11:31.473 --> 11:32.866
- What, now?
- Yeah.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.868
I made salad, we've got tacos,

11:34.911 --> 11:37.131
the kids made some
special dessert; it'll be fun.

11:37.174 --> 11:39.611
Plus, they're saying we don't
have enough people over, so...

11:39.655 --> 11:42.092
- They just want to see Ben.
- No, they want to see you, too.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.485
And they have this special game
they want to play.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.487
Didn't you give up
those girls for adoption?

11:45.530 --> 11:47.184
Oh, yeah,
but they gave 'em right back.

11:47.228 --> 11:50.622
Come on, it'll be fun.
We won't bite.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.455
Dearly departed,
we are gathered here tonight...

11:57.499 --> 11:58.892
Okay, wait, wait, wait,
so what does it mean

11:58.935 --> 12:00.284
if I have the queen of spades?

12:00.328 --> 12:01.329
Mom!

12:01.372 --> 12:03.418
I'm joking, I'm joking.

12:03.461 --> 12:04.506
Whoever got the queen of spades

12:04.549 --> 12:06.247
- is the killer.
- Okay.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.597
And the killer secretly
winks at people to kill them.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.294
- They have to wink?
- Yes.

12:10.338 --> 12:11.643
- Yeah, a wink.
- Yes. But if they wink at you,

12:11.687 --> 12:13.645
don't say you're dead
right away.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.082
Yeah. And if you catch
the person winking,

12:15.125 --> 12:16.083
- then you win,
- Yes.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.562
so look at your cards.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.260
- Okay, okay.
- I'm dead.

12:19.303 --> 12:21.131
- Wait, what?!
- We just started.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.480
Already? Who did that?

12:22.524 --> 12:23.743
Okay, let's concentrate.

12:25.570 --> 12:28.008
- Look around.
- The killer's among us.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.278
What's this game called again?

12:37.321 --> 12:38.453
- Killer.
- <i>The</i> killer.

12:38.496 --> 12:39.846
No, it's not "the."

12:39.889 --> 12:41.238
- It's The Killer.
- It's not The Killer.

12:46.243 --> 12:47.897
I'm dead.

12:47.941 --> 12:50.117
No! Wait, what?!

12:50.160 --> 12:52.336
Who did that?
I didn't see anything.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.555
Mom, don't cover your eyes,
you scaredy cat.

12:53.598 --> 12:54.861
Who came up with this game?

12:54.904 --> 12:56.036
Well,
they taught us at school.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.559
Oh, well, great,
Catholic schools!

12:57.602 --> 12:58.690
Getting ready for
the next crusade.

12:58.734 --> 13:02.172
- I'm dead.
- No! No, really?

13:02.216 --> 13:03.565
- It happened so quickly.
- Who's doing this?

13:03.608 --> 13:05.393
I didn't notice a thing.

13:05.436 --> 13:06.742
That's the whole point, Mom.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.613
Exactly.

13:13.618 --> 13:15.359
I'm dead.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.492
No. Okay, let's just play
a nice game of Candy Land.

13:17.535 --> 13:18.536
- Mom!
- Mom!

13:18.580 --> 13:19.842
Stop it. You're ruining it.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.801
Oh, my God, I'm dead.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.673
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

13:24.716 --> 13:26.240
So now there's just
the two of you left.

13:26.283 --> 13:28.242
- So what happens?
- Yeah, well, David

13:28.285 --> 13:30.026
or Lexis knows who it is,
so they should say something

13:30.070 --> 13:32.028
before they get killed.

13:32.072 --> 13:33.813
Who's it gonna be?

13:33.856 --> 13:35.249
- Wait, wait, wait,

13:35.292 --> 13:36.946
maybe neither one
of them is it.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.469
- It's a spirit.
- It is.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.558
Father Acosta,
I'd say something.

13:40.602 --> 13:41.777
Come on.

13:51.743 --> 13:54.659
- I'm dead.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.052
Why didn't you accuse her?

13:56.096 --> 13:58.489
I didn't want to be rude.

13:58.533 --> 14:01.623
Oh, I am so proud of my daughter
and her killing skills.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.320
I wonder which side
she got it from.

14:03.364 --> 14:06.149
Clearly from my side.

14:10.153 --> 14:12.286
Wait, I thought that
the plumbing was fixed.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.897
Yeah, I thought so, too.
I had plumbers over today.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.507
They brought
the wrong equipment.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.944
- What?
- Yeah.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.249
Took 'em 20 minutes
to figure that out.

14:19.293 --> 14:20.947
They asked us to leave
our room.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.862
Yeah.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.689
- Why?
- I don't know.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.517
I thought they were
gonna steal stuff.

14:28.432 --> 14:30.739
Stop! Why are you always,
like, mean to me?

14:30.782 --> 14:31.871
May I use your restroom, please?

14:31.914 --> 14:33.176
What?

14:33.220 --> 14:35.178
Fifty cents.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.289
- Thank you.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.857
I wanted to thank you

17:12.901 --> 17:14.337
for not saying
what you could've said

17:14.381 --> 17:17.601
at that trial,
or whatever it was.

17:17.645 --> 17:20.300
- Ecclesiastic Review.
- Right.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.519
You could have pointed out
that I saw...

17:22.563 --> 17:25.348
whatever I saw, too,
but you didn't.

17:26.436 --> 17:28.090
I'm not sure why I...

17:28.134 --> 17:30.962
Forget it.

17:31.006 --> 17:34.270
You intimidate me,
so I often don't say

17:34.314 --> 17:35.271
exactly what I mean.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.273
What do you mean?

17:37.317 --> 17:40.059
I had an experience,

17:40.102 --> 17:44.106
and it's thrown my life
off course.

17:44.150 --> 17:47.805
Have you read <i>Portrait of</i>
<i>the Artist as a Young Man?</i>

17:47.849 --> 17:50.286
No?
There's an epiphany in it.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.114
A girl walking on the beach.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.943
And I-I realized...

17:54.986 --> 17:58.860
I've never had
an epiphany in my life.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.122
Until that moment.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.124
- The demon.
- Yes, exactly.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.953
I mean, I know it wasn't
a positive epiphany,

18:04.996 --> 18:07.434
but it woke me up
to what I need to do.

18:07.477 --> 18:10.176
- Get baptized?
- No, write a book.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.352
A book about spirituality,

18:12.395 --> 18:14.397
about an agnostic
who understands

18:14.441 --> 18:16.095
that there's another plane.

18:16.138 --> 18:19.010
Demons. Spirits.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.925
But I need your help, Sister.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.971
I need to understand
what you understand.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.147
Mm-hmm.

18:26.496 --> 18:28.933
- Come with me.
- Thank you, Sister.

18:28.977 --> 18:31.675
I-I feel like I'm nearing
a breakthrough.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.112
I'm one of those people

18:33.155 --> 18:34.200
who doesn't know
what they're thinking

18:34.243 --> 18:36.854
until they write it. Uh...

18:36.898 --> 18:38.987
Sister, I... I can always find

18:39.030 --> 18:41.120
literature like this everywhere.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.382
What-what I need is you.

18:42.425 --> 18:44.732
What I would tell you
is exactly

18:44.775 --> 18:45.820
what is in this literature.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.256
You want to write a book

18:47.300 --> 18:48.692
about a spiritual journey,

18:48.736 --> 18:51.130
read this first.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.181
Good to see you, Kurt.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.531
Dr. Townsend,
what are you doing here?

19:01.575 --> 19:03.533
Oh, packing up my things.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.666
I had a small office
in the church.

19:05.709 --> 19:08.016
But I hear
you're writing a book.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.626
Sounds exciting.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.715
I would like
to offer my services,

19:11.759 --> 19:14.979
if you want,
about the darker side

19:15.023 --> 19:17.982
of the spiritual experience.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.594
Uh...

19:43.791 --> 19:46.315
Yeshua blesses.

19:48.143 --> 19:49.710
Yeshua blesses.

19:51.233 --> 19:54.497
Yeshua blesses.

20:09.512 --> 20:12.428
Well, I don't see Lilli.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.343
How can you tell?
They all look like Lilli.

20:14.387 --> 20:17.085
And I thought
the Catholic Church was white.

20:17.128 --> 20:20.741
And breathe in...

20:23.352 --> 20:24.832
...then out.

20:27.574 --> 20:31.665
Intake the spirit...

20:31.708 --> 20:35.364
...exhale the detritus.

20:36.974 --> 20:40.935
Okay, you stay close to Yeshua.

20:40.978 --> 20:43.546
What? You guys leaving me?

20:43.590 --> 20:45.287
We'll look for Lilli.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.028
You talk to the leader
and find out anything you can

20:47.071 --> 20:48.464
for the exorcism.

20:48.508 --> 20:51.206
Wow, that's vague.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.642
You are loved, Ben.

20:57.299 --> 21:00.389
Yeshua blesses.

21:51.222 --> 21:54.530
Thanks for dinner last night.

21:54.574 --> 21:57.403
You should come more often.
The girls are fun.

21:58.665 --> 22:01.668
- How are the girls?
- They're good.

22:01.711 --> 22:04.061
Fighting over who should get
the new bedroom.

22:04.105 --> 22:07.282
Hmm. Any worries about...

22:07.326 --> 22:08.849
About?

22:08.892 --> 22:10.677
The RSM Fertility issue?

22:12.766 --> 22:14.724
- Are you asking me about Lexis?
- Yeah. I'm just...

22:14.768 --> 22:16.900
checking in.
She seems adorable.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.249
She is adorable.

22:18.293 --> 22:20.251
Kind and considerate.

22:20.295 --> 22:22.515
Guess I never spent
so much time with her.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.995
Look, she's a good girl.

22:25.039 --> 22:28.042
You know better than anyone
our fates aren't predetermined.

22:28.085 --> 22:30.479
I don't care what happened
at RSM Fertility,

22:30.523 --> 22:32.307
she's the product of
a loving family.

22:33.221 --> 22:35.441
You two are the most beautiful
people I've ever seen.

22:35.484 --> 22:37.617
Thank you.

22:37.660 --> 22:40.141
- I'm Carsie.
- Hi, Carsie. I'm--

22:40.184 --> 22:43.013
Oh. Hello. This is, uh, David.

22:43.057 --> 22:44.667
Oh. Hey.

22:44.711 --> 22:46.626
Yeah, we're looking for someone
who lives here.

22:46.669 --> 22:49.672
Uh, maybe you can help us out.
Uh, someone named Lilli.

22:51.674 --> 22:54.982
Oh, Lilli! I love Lilli.

22:55.025 --> 22:58.377
Um, I think she's by the barn.
Let's go.

22:59.595 --> 23:02.381
Come on. You, too.

23:06.907 --> 23:11.302
Om...

23:12.956 --> 23:14.218
Ben.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.746
- Hi. I-I know you, right?
- You do.

23:19.789 --> 23:22.966
Maybe if I wore the goggles.

23:23.010 --> 23:25.404
Oh, my God.

23:25.447 --> 23:26.883
The Secret Science League.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.276
Yeah, I blew up the toaster.

23:28.319 --> 23:30.887
Yeah. You took first place.

23:30.931 --> 23:32.628
That was amazing.

23:32.672 --> 23:33.803
- Rachel.
- Renee.

23:33.847 --> 23:35.588
And you took second place.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.024
Yeah, well, we agreed
on a rematch.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.591
No, you agreed to a rematch.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.984
I told you to get
some more experience first.

23:41.028 --> 23:44.161
Oh. I thought you were flirting.

23:44.205 --> 23:45.902
Oh, my God.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.948
Why is it that when women
point out male inadequacy

23:47.991 --> 23:49.819
men think they're flirting?

23:49.863 --> 23:51.430
Okay.

23:51.473 --> 23:53.301
Hey, I'm about to be rude.

23:53.344 --> 23:54.955
- Oh, thanks for the warning.
- Yeah.

23:54.998 --> 23:57.784
Um, what the fuck
are you doing here?

23:57.827 --> 24:00.961
- I mean, you're not a nut.
- Thank you.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.745
Uh, this is crazy here.

24:02.789 --> 24:05.922
Right? I mean, you gave that
great speech on black holes.

24:05.966 --> 24:07.315
What are you doing here
with this bullshit?

24:07.358 --> 24:09.404
Well, I like bullshit.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.973
I like science and I like this.

24:13.016 --> 24:15.279
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

24:15.323 --> 24:18.239
All right, well,
what does she do?

24:18.282 --> 24:20.023
I heard she channels Jesus.

24:20.067 --> 24:23.679
No. She has a strong faith
and meditates 12 hours a day,

24:23.723 --> 24:25.115
but she doesn't channel Jesus.

24:25.159 --> 24:27.248
- Mm.
- What are you doing here?

24:27.291 --> 24:29.250
Getting close to her.

24:29.293 --> 24:32.122
Someone got very sick
after listening to her.

24:33.384 --> 24:34.560
Who?

24:34.603 --> 24:35.909
Owen Venegas.

24:35.952 --> 24:38.346
Oh, yeah. I know him.

24:38.389 --> 24:40.087
Wait, what-what happened?

24:40.130 --> 24:41.828
Well, there's some disagreement
about that, but, hey,

24:41.871 --> 24:43.090
maybe you can help me.

24:43.133 --> 24:45.396
Can you introduce me to her?

24:45.440 --> 24:46.659
- Sure.

24:46.702 --> 24:50.140
It is now time for Yeshua.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.491
Please.

24:52.534 --> 24:56.320
You just flirted with Jesus.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.542
Good morning.

25:00.586 --> 25:03.327
We all thank God
for another fine day.

25:03.371 --> 25:06.548
Thank you for another fine day.

25:06.592 --> 25:10.117
And we also thank God
for black holes.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.510
Thank you for black holes.

25:13.729 --> 25:17.167
Yeshua wants us to know
that reality

25:17.211 --> 25:19.822
is never just one thing.

25:19.866 --> 25:23.696
It is both love and science.

25:23.739 --> 25:26.568
Hug the person next to you
right now.

25:31.225 --> 25:34.924
So there is a movie
with a criminal

25:34.968 --> 25:37.884
who had "hate" tattooed
on one hand,

25:37.927 --> 25:40.321
and "love" on the other.

25:40.364 --> 25:43.846
And he brought them together,
and they struggled.

25:43.890 --> 25:47.197
Those tattoos today
would say "God" and "science."

25:47.241 --> 25:50.157
They struggle.

25:50.200 --> 25:54.814
They fight, they try
to subdue one another.

25:54.857 --> 25:56.729
But...

25:58.557 --> 26:00.950
I think I can ask
a friend here,

26:00.994 --> 26:03.126
a good friend, Ben--

26:03.170 --> 26:05.476
Yeah, I know,
I'm embarrassing you,

26:05.520 --> 26:06.695
but I think you can help us.

26:13.180 --> 26:16.618
What is quantum entanglement?

26:19.229 --> 26:21.492
- You want an answer?
- Yes, please.

26:21.536 --> 26:24.321
- Enlighten us.
- Okay, uh, well,

26:24.365 --> 26:27.586
quantum entanglement is when
two or more particles link up

26:27.629 --> 26:29.500
so that no matter
how far apart they are,

26:29.544 --> 26:31.677
- their states remain linked.
- Mm-hmm.

26:31.720 --> 26:36.507
So what if I told you that
Yeshua and I are entangled?

26:36.551 --> 26:40.990
Across 2,000 years and
6,000 miles, we are linked,

26:41.034 --> 26:43.036
so that no matter
how far apart we are,

26:43.079 --> 26:46.822
our states remain linked.

26:46.866 --> 26:48.911
I would say that is not

26:48.955 --> 26:52.349
- how that works.

26:55.178 --> 26:57.224
Kneel down beside me.

26:57.267 --> 26:58.878
Uh, I'm not gonna kneel.

26:58.921 --> 27:00.793
Sit down, then.

27:04.710 --> 27:08.365
So, this is a scam, right?

27:08.409 --> 27:11.673
Oh, ye of little faith.

27:11.717 --> 27:14.023
Um, put your hand in mine.

27:15.372 --> 27:17.331
Why?

27:17.374 --> 27:19.246
I want to compare hands.

27:24.251 --> 27:25.861
What, is this a cult thing?

27:25.905 --> 27:28.429
Yeah.

27:28.472 --> 27:30.561
What are you looking for?

27:30.605 --> 27:33.303
Entanglement.

27:41.398 --> 27:43.923
Owen's been asking
about you, Lilli.

27:43.966 --> 27:45.881
Where is Owen?
Is he all right?

27:45.925 --> 27:48.449
Yes. Actually,
that's why we're here.

27:48.492 --> 27:51.321
He needs your help.
We need to take you to him.

27:52.366 --> 27:54.760
Carsie, I've got this.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.109
No problem, I can stay.

27:56.152 --> 27:58.198
No, no, I'll get you later.

28:02.942 --> 28:04.117
Where is he? Where's Owen?

28:04.160 --> 28:06.989
A motel, Highway 85.

28:07.033 --> 28:09.296
We can take you there.
We're going now.

28:11.733 --> 28:15.781
Who sent you, Owen
or the other two?

28:15.824 --> 28:19.045
The other...
Who's that?

28:19.088 --> 28:20.742
Two men in ski masks.

28:20.786 --> 28:23.745
They-they drove up in a van
to the gates,

28:23.789 --> 28:25.181
jumped out and dragged Owen in.

28:25.225 --> 28:28.532
I chased after them,
but they took off.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.143
Are they the ones
who sent you?

28:30.186 --> 28:32.362
Lilli, those men you talk about,
we don't work for them.

28:32.406 --> 28:33.799
We work for the Catholic Church.

28:33.842 --> 28:36.279
They took Owen to be
deprogrammed.

28:36.323 --> 28:38.673
When Owen was deprogrammed,
he became possessed.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.067
Possessed?

28:41.110 --> 28:43.286
What are you talking about?
That sounds nuts.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.680
Lilli, you need help over there?

28:45.724 --> 28:48.552
Lilli, here's my number.

28:48.596 --> 28:50.206
Call me and we'll come get you.

28:50.250 --> 28:53.296
I'll stay with you
the whole time. Owen needs you.

28:57.083 --> 28:58.432
Let me think about it.

29:02.479 --> 29:04.655
I need to get this.

29:04.699 --> 29:06.788
Okay. I'll go collect Ben.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.790
Hello, sir.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.879

<i>Is est a Deo habetur.</i>

29:10.923 --> 29:12.794
Not the best time.

29:12.838 --> 29:15.144
<i>You're 15 minutes out of town.</i>
<i>I need you to return.</i>

29:15.188 --> 29:16.972
<i>I'll see you at your room</i>
<i>in one hour.</i>

29:17.016 --> 29:18.408
How do you know where I am?

29:18.452 --> 29:20.106
<i>David, you're</i>
<i>a Friend of the Vatican.</i>

29:20.149 --> 29:22.064
<i>We always know where you are.</i>

29:22.108 --> 29:23.762
I'm in the middle of something.
I can't leave.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.938
<i>You have five minutes</i>
<i>to get in your car.</i>

29:25.981 --> 29:27.809
- Listen...
<i>- No, David.</i>

29:27.853 --> 29:29.593
<i>If you want to intervene</i>
<i>for your friend's daughter,</i>

29:29.637 --> 29:31.639
<i>you'd better come now.</i>

29:32.683 --> 29:34.685
I'm coming.

29:45.479 --> 29:47.133
You go get him
<i>right now.</i>

29:47.176 --> 29:48.743
<i>- I cannot do that.</i>
- Okay, listen. Lis--

29:48.787 --> 29:50.136
- That is what I am saying.
- We have to go.

29:50.179 --> 29:51.920
- What's wrong?
- I was explaining to your friend

29:51.964 --> 29:54.488
that Renee has asked Ben to stay
for dinner; it's quite an honor.

29:54.531 --> 29:57.056
Yes, and I was telling her
that she can go fuck herself.

29:57.099 --> 30:00.537
- Who's Renee?
- Yeshua's earthly vessel.

30:00.581 --> 30:01.974
She's a friend of Ben's.

30:02.017 --> 30:03.758
Ma'am, sir, please come with us.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.674
Yeshua needs a few hours
with Ben. You are loved.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.981
Oh, my God.
You get him right now,

30:09.024 --> 30:10.939
- or I'm calling the police.
- Ma'am, you are loved.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.985
Hey, what's up?

30:13.028 --> 30:14.900
Hey. Hey, Ben.
Hey, where are you?

30:14.943 --> 30:17.293
<i>I'm with the cult leader,</i>
<i>like we said. Where are you?</i>

30:17.337 --> 30:19.861
- We're being kicked out.
<i>- What? Why?</i>

30:19.905 --> 30:21.820
They want you to have
some private time with her.

30:21.863 --> 30:24.779
- Are you safe?
<i>- Yeah. We're just talking.</i>

30:24.823 --> 30:26.607
Uh, are you kicking
my friends out?

30:26.650 --> 30:27.956
No. Tell them to stay.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.045
We need more heathens
to sacrifice.

30:30.089 --> 30:32.656
- What?
<i>- She-She's joking.</i>

30:32.700 --> 30:35.094
We have to head off.
We'll come back and get you.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.443
Call us if there are
any issues.

30:36.486 --> 30:38.793
Gimme.
Ben, are you really safe?

30:38.837 --> 30:40.839
I'm really okay.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.536
<i>They're not sucking you in?</i>

30:42.579 --> 30:45.060
Uh, hold on, let me ask.

30:45.104 --> 30:46.714
- Are you sucking me in?

30:46.757 --> 30:49.630
That is a straight line
I'm gonna let pass.

30:49.673 --> 30:52.067
Kristen, I am fine.
I will see you tonight.

30:52.111 --> 30:53.808
- Okay.

30:53.852 --> 30:57.333
Oh, you didn't tell them
about the sacrifice tonight,

30:57.377 --> 30:59.161
and how we have
to drain you of your blood?

30:59.205 --> 31:01.860
Oh, I forgot.

31:05.037 --> 31:06.952
Wait, what--
what's going on, David?

31:06.995 --> 31:08.692
What do you mean?

31:08.736 --> 31:10.694
Ben is stuck at a frickin' cult,

31:10.738 --> 31:13.132
and we're rushing to some
unknown meeting at your church.

31:13.175 --> 31:14.785
And it's not the first time
for one of your

31:14.829 --> 31:16.439
mysterious phone calls.

31:16.483 --> 31:19.094
Kristen, I'm a priest.

31:19.138 --> 31:21.314
I don't control my own fate.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.926
- I'll drop you at home.
- No, I'm fine.

31:24.970 --> 31:27.015
We'll be driving by your house.

31:27.059 --> 31:28.451
I can pick you up afterwards.

31:28.495 --> 31:30.453
I'll come with you.

31:36.677 --> 31:38.287
You were talking
about the darker side

31:38.331 --> 31:40.899
of the spiritual experience.
What did you mean?

31:40.942 --> 31:43.249
Do you know how many
English translations there are

31:43.292 --> 31:45.468
of Dante's <i>Inferno?</i>

31:45.512 --> 31:47.296
A hundred and thirty-four.

31:47.340 --> 31:51.039
Do you know how many there are
of the <i>Paradiso?</i> 12.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.954
You want to know why?

31:52.998 --> 31:54.303
I didn't even know
that was true.

31:54.347 --> 31:55.914
Because angelic is boring.

31:55.957 --> 31:59.091
It'd be like watching industrial
films about syphilis.

31:59.134 --> 32:00.919
No wonder you have
writer's block. Here.

32:00.962 --> 32:03.095
I come bearing props.

32:09.188 --> 32:11.930
You light this candle,

32:11.973 --> 32:14.758
somewhere near the typewriter,

32:14.802 --> 32:17.022
and turn out the lights.

32:17.065 --> 32:20.590
Cut your hand with this knife,
but only lightly.

32:20.634 --> 32:23.811
You need 12 drops of blood
to fall on the paper.

32:23.854 --> 32:25.944
Now, do you mean
laser printer paper?

32:25.987 --> 32:27.423
I-I work on a laptop.

32:27.467 --> 32:28.816
On the laptop screen.

32:28.859 --> 32:32.472
Then play this song
and sing to it.

32:32.515 --> 32:35.518
Now, see, I-I don't have
a turntable.

32:35.562 --> 32:38.173
Well, go get one. Who said
writing was gonna be easy?

32:38.217 --> 32:40.567
Now remember, candle,

32:40.610 --> 32:43.613
blood, sing, in that order.

32:45.789 --> 32:48.967
- And what will this do?
- You saw a demon, Kurt.

32:49.010 --> 32:52.231
It scared you, but it made you
hungry for more.

32:52.274 --> 32:54.015
This is the more.

32:54.059 --> 32:57.497
Candle, blood, sing.

32:57.540 --> 32:58.672
Do it.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.655

<i>Come on, children, sing.</i>

34:15.357 --> 34:17.185

<i>I said sing!</i>

34:22.495 --> 34:24.540

<i>Sing louder, please.</i>

34:37.597 --> 34:39.686
Now, children,
<i>it's time to write.</i>

35:16.679 --> 35:19.421
Kristen, do you mind
waiting here?

35:19.465 --> 35:22.903
Sure. Is there someone
in your room?

35:22.946 --> 35:24.774
I'll be right out.

35:32.956 --> 35:35.655
Tell me how to lock this door
so no one can enter.

35:35.698 --> 35:39.180
These three gentlemen are from
the <i>Corpo della Gendarmeria</i>

35:39.224 --> 35:42.705
<i>dello Stato</i>
<i>della Città del Vaticano.</i>

35:42.749 --> 35:45.099
They have the same question
I do.

35:46.056 --> 35:47.667
You took something
from the bedroom

35:47.710 --> 35:49.234
of a child of our concern.

35:49.277 --> 35:50.496
- You planted something?
- Yes.

35:50.539 --> 35:52.541
We found another way to fulfill

35:52.585 --> 35:53.629
the service you would not.

35:53.673 --> 35:55.718
Every child is a potentiality.

35:55.762 --> 35:57.503
Nature versus nurture.

35:57.546 --> 36:00.070
- This child has a good mother.
- This mother

36:00.114 --> 36:01.594
turned her back on the Church.

36:01.637 --> 36:03.073
She has committed evil acts.

36:03.117 --> 36:05.902
Stop. The Entity has committed
evil acts.

36:05.946 --> 36:07.600
We are not the Entity,
we are Friends of the Vatican.

36:07.643 --> 36:09.776
David.

36:12.387 --> 36:13.823
Kristen, give me a minute.

36:13.867 --> 36:15.521
- You brought her here?
- You called me

36:15.564 --> 36:16.870
in the middle of an assessment.

36:16.913 --> 36:18.393
What did you think
I was gonna do?

36:18.437 --> 36:19.960
David, I have to ask
you something.

36:20.003 --> 36:21.918
Give me five minutes.

36:21.962 --> 36:24.312
Unfortunately,
I have to ask you right now.

36:30.362 --> 36:33.147
- What's up?
- David, what's going on?

36:35.541 --> 36:36.672
I need a minute.

36:36.716 --> 36:39.153
Who are you in there with?

36:40.198 --> 36:42.330
Excuse me.

36:42.374 --> 36:46.552
Kristen Bouchard, hello.
Remember me?

36:46.595 --> 36:48.336
Victor Leconte.

36:48.380 --> 36:51.513
Yes. The Entity.

36:51.557 --> 36:54.995
No, just a Vatican functionary.
Come in.

36:58.477 --> 37:00.348
This looks serious in here.

37:01.349 --> 37:04.439
We were just talking
about RSM Fertility

37:04.483 --> 37:07.790
and the sigil map.

37:07.834 --> 37:09.052
- Really?
- Yes.

37:09.096 --> 37:12.926
You and David and...

37:12.969 --> 37:14.449
- Ben?
- Right.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.799
You have pushed us
to dig deeper into it.

37:16.843 --> 37:18.714
We're just trying to figure out
what to do.

37:21.369 --> 37:22.631
Any thoughts?

37:22.675 --> 37:24.111
Well, the only thing
we can think

37:24.154 --> 37:26.635
is to keep track of
these RSM children.

37:26.679 --> 37:28.028
Did you have a thought?

37:28.071 --> 37:29.508
Are you sure you want me
to have a thought?

37:29.551 --> 37:31.945
- Tell me what you mean.
- I'm a woman.

37:31.988 --> 37:34.426
I'm a mother.
I had an embryo implanted in me

37:34.469 --> 37:36.689
from RSM Fertility, and I'm
pretty sure you know that

37:36.732 --> 37:38.212
and you think I'm biased
in some way.

37:40.693 --> 37:42.521
Kristen, your daughter
is a child of God.

37:42.564 --> 37:44.000
Is that what David's been
telling you?

37:44.044 --> 37:46.742
No. David has insisted on
not helping us because

37:46.786 --> 37:48.266
that would mean betraying you.

37:54.707 --> 37:57.362
And yet you opened
the door for me.

37:57.405 --> 37:58.798
So what are you about?

38:00.669 --> 38:03.585
I want to enlist
the help of the mother.

38:03.629 --> 38:06.632
Your daughter, Lexis,
is being groomed.

38:08.677 --> 38:09.939
Excuse me?

38:09.983 --> 38:11.463
She's being influenced
by others

38:11.506 --> 38:14.509
to carry on
a demonic tradition.

38:21.603 --> 38:23.736
This is a map you'll recognize.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.999
This sigil here,
that is the one

38:26.042 --> 38:28.131
your daughter is being
groomed for.

38:28.175 --> 38:29.698
It is a key sigil.

38:29.742 --> 38:32.005
Many rely on it
as a leader.

38:32.048 --> 38:34.181
It matters more to us
than 20 of the others.

38:34.224 --> 38:37.097
- H-How is she being groomed?
- You know how.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.794
You stopped Leland Townsend

38:38.838 --> 38:40.709
from having direct contact
with her.

38:42.102 --> 38:43.408
So this isn't
about my daughter.

38:43.451 --> 38:45.061
This is about Leland.

38:45.105 --> 38:46.672
I would agree.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.674
Then why aren't you
doing something about him?

38:48.717 --> 38:51.241
Why was he working
as a doctor for the Church?

38:51.285 --> 38:54.201
We needed to keep him close.

38:54.244 --> 38:57.465
Now we want you
to work with us.

38:58.466 --> 38:59.946
David has great faith in you.

38:59.989 --> 39:02.514
Well, I don't believe
in the supernatural.

39:02.557 --> 39:06.082
Neither do I. Maybe that
surprises you, but I think

39:06.126 --> 39:08.824
that God forces us to move
on the earthly plane

39:08.868 --> 39:11.131
to bring in His kingdom.

39:11.174 --> 39:13.263
We want you to work
with David and us

39:13.307 --> 39:15.048
to stop Leland.

39:15.091 --> 39:18.443
He is intent on putting your
daughter on a demonic throne

39:18.486 --> 39:20.053
above the destroyed world.

39:20.096 --> 39:21.794
I'm sorry, <i>what?</i>

39:21.837 --> 39:24.797
You must have wondered why
Leland was targeting you.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.059
Why did he go after you
at court

39:26.102 --> 39:27.626
<i>from the very beginning?</i>

39:27.669 --> 39:29.758
<i>Why Orson LeRoux?</i>
<i>Why Dwight Ferrell?</i>

39:29.802 --> 39:32.544
<i>Why your delusions?</i>
<i>Why your night terrors?</i>

39:33.545 --> 39:35.111
Yes, we know everything.

39:35.155 --> 39:38.419
None of this is mysterious.
It is human.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.726
This is not about you,
this is about your daughter.

39:40.769 --> 39:41.814
What are you doing?

39:41.857 --> 39:44.033
I'm calling an Uber.

39:44.077 --> 39:45.557
- I'm going home.
- Why?

39:45.600 --> 39:46.862
Because I have to hug
my daughter.

39:46.906 --> 39:48.124
Wait. Stay.

39:48.168 --> 39:50.997
- Do you have kids?
- No.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.999
Then shut the fuck up.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.436
I'm going to hug my daughter.

39:56.872 --> 39:58.700
Keep her in line.

39:59.701 --> 40:02.182
She's a mother.

40:02.225 --> 40:03.923
You need to stay in line.

40:03.966 --> 40:05.968
No, I'll be right there.

40:06.012 --> 40:09.276
Just do what they say.
We're coming right now.

40:09.319 --> 40:10.886
- Ben?
- No, Lilli.

40:10.930 --> 40:12.235
She went to the motel.

40:12.279 --> 40:13.541
- Damn it.
- Yeah.

40:28.077 --> 40:30.515
Om...

40:36.999 --> 40:40.525
I'm feeling like
this is, like, dorm life

40:40.568 --> 40:43.223
- circa 2004, you know?
- Mm.

40:43.266 --> 40:47.445
I mean, all you need on the tape
deck is "Hey Ya."

40:47.488 --> 40:49.055
Oh. Boop.

40:56.497 --> 40:59.065
- What's going on?
- Um...

40:59.108 --> 41:00.283
Don't freak out, okay?

41:00.327 --> 41:03.635
- Um, okay. Uh...

41:03.678 --> 41:05.419
Okay, so what, are we in
<i>Midsommar</i> territory now?

41:05.463 --> 41:07.639
You gonna push me off a cliff
or something?

41:07.682 --> 41:11.469
Not quite, but seriously,
don't freak out.

41:11.512 --> 41:13.166
There will be some blood.

41:13.209 --> 41:15.211
My blood?

41:17.866 --> 41:19.215
Are-are you joking?

41:19.259 --> 41:21.261
No, I just worry that you'll--

41:22.305 --> 41:24.264
Renee?

41:28.747 --> 41:30.618
- Are-are you okay?

41:43.936 --> 41:46.547
- Yeshua.

41:46.591 --> 41:48.549
- Yeshua.

41:48.593 --> 41:50.812
- Are you all right?
- Uh... okay, all right.

41:53.119 --> 41:54.947
Yeshua.

41:54.990 --> 41:56.122
Yeshua.

41:56.165 --> 41:57.515
Are you all right?

41:57.558 --> 41:59.038
- Yeshua!

42:01.040 --> 42:04.173
- Okay, she said something...
- It's time for the sacrifice!

42:04.217 --> 42:06.393
Okay, uh, Renee,
I'll call you later, okay?

42:06.436 --> 42:09.483
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Okay, okay. Excuse me.

42:09.527 --> 42:12.355
Okay, okay, calm down.

42:15.533 --> 42:18.144
Bless Yeshua.

42:18.187 --> 42:20.233
Bless Yeshua.

42:20.276 --> 42:23.410
- Bless Yeshua.
- Okay. Hey, hey, hey!

42:36.858 --> 42:38.730
Where are you?

42:44.257 --> 42:45.388
Help me, muse.

42:47.434 --> 42:49.044
Where the hell are you?

42:52.221 --> 42:55.137
Come on. I need you.

42:57.618 --> 42:59.620
- Why are you bitching?
- Oh.

42:59.664 --> 43:01.840
I'm not bitching.
Oh, I-I was writing great stuff.

43:01.883 --> 43:04.625
Oh, it-it just flowed. I...
I've never

43:04.669 --> 43:06.671
- had that feeling before.
- Mm.

43:06.714 --> 43:08.847
Like someone was
writing through you?

43:08.890 --> 43:12.546
It was. Like-like I was
sharing half my brain.

43:12.590 --> 43:15.331
I wrote ten pages
like it was nothing.

43:15.375 --> 43:16.419
Then what?

43:18.944 --> 43:21.381
It stopped.

43:21.424 --> 43:23.688
I didn't do anything. I...

43:23.731 --> 43:27.213
It just... Boom.

43:27.256 --> 43:30.303
Your muse fled.

43:30.346 --> 43:32.435
How do I get it back?

43:32.479 --> 43:35.438
Do you really want to know?

43:35.482 --> 43:37.136
Yes.

43:37.179 --> 43:38.703
That's why I'm asking.

43:38.746 --> 43:41.053
Hemingway asked.

43:41.096 --> 43:42.707
Fitzgerald.

43:42.750 --> 43:44.622
Joyce.

43:44.665 --> 43:46.232
Mailer.

43:46.275 --> 43:48.190
Pound.

43:48.234 --> 43:51.106
But you have to be prepared
to do what they did.

43:52.673 --> 43:53.935
What did they do?

44:00.028 --> 44:01.639
Use these.

44:02.944 --> 44:04.772
- How?
- Sister Andrea.

44:04.816 --> 44:06.818
Cut her hair.

44:06.861 --> 44:08.863
Cut it all off,

44:08.907 --> 44:11.039
and your muse will return.

44:14.129 --> 44:15.217
You're joking.

44:15.261 --> 44:17.176
No, I'm not.

44:28.143 --> 44:30.102
- Where is she?
- Shh.

44:30.145 --> 44:31.538
Where's Lilli?

44:31.581 --> 44:33.279
...master of all deceit.

44:33.322 --> 44:35.150
Begone, Satan,

44:35.194 --> 44:37.979
enemy of man's salvation.
Give place to Christ.

44:40.547 --> 44:42.984
- Begone, Satan.
- Where's Lilli?

44:43.028 --> 44:44.856
She tried to break him free.

44:46.422 --> 44:48.686
Give place to Christ
in Whom you have

44:48.729 --> 44:49.861
- found none of your works.

44:49.904 --> 44:51.689
Begone, Satan,

44:51.732 --> 44:52.820
the inventor and master
of deceit.

44:53.908 --> 44:55.301
Begone, Satan,

44:55.344 --> 44:57.825
- enemy of man's salvation.
- Oh, my God.

44:57.869 --> 45:00.219
Stop them. They're killing him.

45:00.262 --> 45:02.047
Wait. Lilli. They're not.
They're trying to save him.

45:02.090 --> 45:05.180
- What are you talking about?
- Give place to Christ...

45:05.224 --> 45:06.660
- Owen!
- in Whom you have found

45:06.704 --> 45:08.618
- none of your works.
- I love you!

45:08.662 --> 45:10.882
I'm here. I'm here for you!

45:10.925 --> 45:11.970
Lilli?

45:12.013 --> 45:13.928
Owen, fight it.

45:13.972 --> 45:15.843
Fight it!

45:15.887 --> 45:18.063
I'm here, Owen. Owen,

45:18.106 --> 45:19.804
I love you.

45:19.847 --> 45:22.023
Owen, fight it! Fight it!

45:22.067 --> 45:23.329
Lilli!

45:23.372 --> 45:24.722
No!

45:24.765 --> 45:27.594
- No.
- No, no. It's okay. It's okay.

45:27.637 --> 45:29.030
- I'm here, Owen.
- I'm so sorry.

45:29.074 --> 45:30.815
I didn't know where you were.
I didn't.

45:30.858 --> 45:33.034
- Lilli, I'm so sorry.
- I'm here, Owen.

45:33.078 --> 45:35.994
- I love you.

45:43.392 --> 45:45.307
Hey, Ben, what's up?
How's it going?

45:49.224 --> 45:51.226
Ben?

45:51.270 --> 45:52.619
Hello?

46:05.414 --> 46:07.677
- I am guilty!

46:07.721 --> 46:09.679
Yeshua,

46:09.723 --> 46:11.333
take my guilt!

46:11.377 --> 46:13.509
Yeshua...

46:13.553 --> 46:15.642
Yeshua blesses.

46:15.685 --> 46:17.862
Yeshua blesses.

46:17.905 --> 46:19.777
Master,

46:19.820 --> 46:22.388
I have been found guilty.

46:22.431 --> 46:24.825
I am guilty!

46:27.480 --> 46:30.483
I killed my mother!

46:30.526 --> 46:32.354
Murderer.

46:32.398 --> 46:34.661
When she gave birth to me,

46:34.704 --> 46:36.837
she was bloody.

46:36.881 --> 46:38.447
I made her bloody.

46:38.491 --> 46:40.928
Murderer!

46:40.972 --> 46:43.888
- Murderer!

46:46.586 --> 46:48.849
Praise Yeshua.

46:48.893 --> 46:50.764
Praise her.

46:50.808 --> 46:52.984
Release me from my shame.

46:53.027 --> 46:54.463
Release yourself.

47:14.919 --> 47:17.965
It's just his voice mail.

47:18.009 --> 47:19.880
We shouldn't have
left him there.

47:35.113 --> 47:36.157
Ben?

47:38.464 --> 47:39.639
No, I'm good.

47:39.682 --> 47:41.859
You're not good.

47:41.902 --> 47:43.077
You're guilty.

47:43.121 --> 47:44.557
No, I'm not.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.211
Look, I don't believe
in all this.

47:46.254 --> 47:47.777
Okay? Sorry, I...

47:47.821 --> 47:50.171
I don't believe that
you're channeling Jesus.

47:50.215 --> 47:53.435
I don't-- Hey.
I'll rephrase that.

47:53.479 --> 47:55.133
Your mother.

47:56.656 --> 47:58.092
Excuse me?

47:58.136 --> 48:01.835
You blame yourself
for your mother's death.

48:01.879 --> 48:03.402
No, I don't.

48:03.445 --> 48:04.925
Where-where-where you
getting all that?

48:04.969 --> 48:06.927
Your sister.

48:06.971 --> 48:08.886
At the Science League,
she told me.

48:08.929 --> 48:11.323
You broke your mother's heart.

48:11.366 --> 48:13.891
That's why you think
you killed her.

48:17.329 --> 48:19.331
You're guilty.

48:20.941 --> 48:23.552
- Guilt.

48:23.596 --> 48:24.945
Guilt.

48:24.989 --> 48:27.165
Guilt.

48:27.208 --> 48:28.993
- Guilt!
- Okay, all right.

48:29.036 --> 48:30.429
- Okay, everybody... Shh!
- Guilt!

48:30.472 --> 48:32.257
Hey, guys, guys, shh.

48:32.300 --> 48:34.563
Everybody,
that's-that's not helping.

48:34.607 --> 48:37.131
I mean, even if
I was feeling guilty,

48:37.175 --> 48:39.307
okay, I wouldn't crawl
around on the floor

48:39.351 --> 48:42.397
like some kind of nut,
hitting myself.

48:42.441 --> 48:44.965
Right?
That-that doesn't do anything.

48:45.009 --> 48:47.011
- Guilty!
- Okay, okay, stop.

48:51.929 --> 48:54.975
Stop, stop. I am

48:55.019 --> 48:56.934
facing up to it.

48:56.977 --> 48:59.327
Okay? That's what
you have to do.

48:59.371 --> 49:01.851
Look, you didn't
kill your mother.

49:01.895 --> 49:04.463
It happens.
Childbirth mortality

49:04.506 --> 49:06.465
is always a danger.

49:06.508 --> 49:09.511
- Hey, hey!

49:09.555 --> 49:11.774
- No!

49:16.083 --> 49:17.955
Okay, hey, Renee.

49:17.998 --> 49:19.913
Jesus.

49:19.957 --> 49:22.872
Hey, remember science?

49:22.916 --> 49:25.223
This is not science.

49:25.266 --> 49:28.791
Okay? This is some
crazy cult shit.

49:28.835 --> 49:30.663
Come on.

49:47.985 --> 49:50.074
Through here.

50:01.607 --> 50:02.869
Ben!

50:05.089 --> 50:07.830
- Ben?

50:10.094 --> 50:11.051
Oh, my God.

50:11.095 --> 50:12.705
There.

50:14.359 --> 50:15.360
Ben!

50:20.104 --> 50:21.714
Ben?

50:26.371 --> 50:29.069
- Hey, guys.

50:29.113 --> 50:30.201
How's it going?

50:30.244 --> 50:32.290
What the hell?

50:32.333 --> 50:33.726
What did they do to you?

50:33.769 --> 50:35.510
Oh, this? Eh, it's not mine.

50:37.121 --> 50:38.948
What happened?

50:38.992 --> 50:42.039
Uh, they killed a goat, and
they poured his blood over me.

50:44.215 --> 50:45.433
Why?

50:45.477 --> 50:47.348
Religion.

51:36.571 --> 51:39.183
- Mom?
- Yeah?

51:45.102 --> 51:47.234
You smell like blood.
