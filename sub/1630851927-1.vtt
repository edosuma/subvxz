02:21.727 --> 02:23.212
- I'm an hour from the hospital.

02:23.281 --> 02:24.799

- Yeah? How's Ethan?

12:01.444 --> 12:04.275

Teeter took him to the vet.

12:04.344 --> 12:05.897
- Where are the bodies at?

12:05.966 --> 12:07.485
- In my truck.

12:07.554 --> 12:09.659
- Well, get fuckin'
rid of 'em, Lloyd.

12:10.453 --> 12:12.455

12:22.396 --> 12:25.089
- Sorry, Rip, I just...

12:25.158 --> 12:27.056
Didn't have the heart
to tell ya.

12:44.591 --> 12:45.765
- Let's go.

14:45.022 --> 14:46.644
- Indians.

14:46.713 --> 14:47.887
- Yeah.

14:47.956 --> 14:48.818
- Why aren't they on
the reservation?

14:48.888 --> 14:50.130
- I don't know.

14:51.373 --> 14:53.306
- Do you know the way home?

14:56.757 --> 14:58.759
- All right.
Stay here.

15:03.730 --> 15:05.352
- What do we do?

15:05.421 --> 15:07.907
- We do what he said.
We stay here.

15:34.623 --> 15:35.935
What do they want?

15:36.004 --> 15:37.660
- I don't know.

15:37.729 --> 15:40.801
But they got a man at their camp
who speaks English.

15:40.870 --> 15:42.424
- Do you trust them?

15:42.493 --> 15:45.599
- Son, I don't trust anyone.

15:45.668 --> 15:46.704
Till they've earned it.

15:48.016 --> 15:49.362
Y'all stay close to me.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.240
- This your land now?

16:06.241 --> 16:08.346
- It is.

16:08.415 --> 16:09.934
- Used to be ours.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.558
- I'm not the one
that took it from you.

16:13.627 --> 16:15.491
- Doesn't matter.
Still got took.

16:20.117 --> 16:21.532
- You here to try
to take it back?

16:24.569 --> 16:25.812
- Here to ask a favor.

16:28.159 --> 16:29.264
- Ask.

16:31.059 --> 16:32.612
- My father was born here.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.306
This is where he'd like to rest.

16:39.619 --> 16:41.345
- So you want to bury him here?

16:43.140 --> 16:45.280
- I want to put him in that tree

16:46.591 --> 16:47.834
where the wolves
won't dig him up

16:47.903 --> 16:50.906
and he won't
spend the spring in the mud.

16:50.975 --> 16:52.218
Where relatives can come visit.

16:54.565 --> 16:59.328
He could find peace
in that tree a long time ago.

17:02.952 --> 17:06.163
Now there is no peace.

17:06.232 --> 17:09.062
Maybe you sell this land
or lose it to a bank.

17:10.857 --> 17:15.068
Then someone finds this tree
and scatters his bones.

17:15.137 --> 17:16.242
Steals his sacreds.

17:19.072 --> 17:22.041
Then he has no peace forever.

17:27.046 --> 17:31.567
So, I will bury him here
if you'll let me.

17:34.812 --> 17:37.056
- I'll let you.

17:37.125 --> 17:39.265
Where do you want to bury him?

17:39.334 --> 17:43.027
- Someplace no one finds him.
You included.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.446
- It's a long ride
from the reservation.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.552
- Mm.

17:50.621 --> 17:51.622
Eight sleeps.

17:53.486 --> 17:55.039
- These horses look hungry.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.490
- They are.

17:58.663 --> 17:59.699
- You look hungry too.

18:01.356 --> 18:02.840
- I'm used to being hungry.

18:06.292 --> 18:07.500
- Yeah.

18:08.639 --> 18:10.572
It's been a hard winter.

18:10.641 --> 18:12.056
- All winters are hard.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.644
This one...

18:13.713 --> 18:15.439
This one is punishment.

18:16.716 --> 18:18.200
- Your horses can graze here

18:18.269 --> 18:21.859
while you choose a spot
for your father.

18:21.928 --> 18:23.619
I'll leave you a beef.

18:23.688 --> 18:25.380
Your family can graze, too.

18:25.449 --> 18:27.002
- Thank you.

18:28.969 --> 18:32.041
- Boys, let's push these cattle
out of here.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.491
Cut out a steer for 'em,
all right?

18:35.666 --> 18:37.254
- I'm sorry for you
being punished.

18:38.772 --> 18:39.911
- We are, too.

18:41.327 --> 18:42.742
- Come on.

18:48.023 --> 18:51.647
- Ya!

18:55.824 --> 18:56.894
Ya.

19:00.622 --> 19:01.830
Let's go, boys.

19:18.295 --> 19:19.434
Let's go, boys.

19:28.443 --> 19:30.790
- That's a disconnect code.

19:30.859 --> 19:32.481
- Dietician's in there?

19:32.550 --> 19:33.517
- No one's in there.

19:35.829 --> 19:36.830
- Oh my God.

19:36.899 --> 19:39.212
Oh my God, no.

19:43.251 --> 19:45.770
- What is today?

19:46.840 --> 19:48.739
- Thursday.

19:48.808 --> 19:50.154
- The month.

19:50.223 --> 19:51.673
- August.

19:51.742 --> 19:53.295
- You need to lay down.

19:53.364 --> 19:54.538
- Been laying down long enough.

19:54.607 --> 19:55.987
- <i>We have a code three.
422 I.C.U.</i>

19:56.056 --> 19:57.644
- What's a code three?
- You are.

19:57.713 --> 19:59.198
- I'm not asking.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.512
- Daddy.

20:09.346 --> 20:10.795
- What happened to you?

20:13.073 --> 20:14.627
- Same thing that
happened to you.

20:18.009 --> 20:19.597
- Who else did it happen to?

20:20.771 --> 20:22.290
- Happened to all of us.

20:22.359 --> 20:23.291
- Mr. Dutton, we need to get
you back to bed.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.706
- Who did we lose?

20:26.017 --> 20:27.536
- Define lose, Daddy.
- Who did we lose?

20:27.605 --> 20:28.813
- Get me some Persantine.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.888
- All right, Mr. Dutton,
we're going to sit you down.

20:34.957 --> 20:37.408
Can I see your right hand?

20:37.477 --> 20:39.272
Got to put this
back in, okay?

20:45.174 --> 20:47.418
Mr. Dutton, count back from
a hundred for me, okay?

20:47.487 --> 20:48.592
- What?
- 99.

20:48.661 --> 20:50.525
- What are you doing?
No, Dad. No!

20:50.594 --> 20:51.560
What are you doing?

20:51.629 --> 20:53.493
You tell me he'll never wake up

20:53.562 --> 20:55.426
and when he does you put
him back to fucking sleep?

20:55.495 --> 20:56.600
- If he has a blood clot,
and I can promise you he does,

20:56.669 --> 20:58.049
- Get your fucking hands off me!

20:58.118 --> 20:59.810
- Movement can dislodge
it and send it into his heart

20:59.879 --> 21:01.432
and then he woke up for nothing.
Let me do my--

21:01.501 --> 21:03.883
- Daddy!
- Let me do my job.

21:03.952 --> 21:06.195
Keep her out here
until I say otherwise.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.326
- What happened to your face?

21:35.397 --> 21:37.641
- What happened to yours,
you insensitive little fuck?

21:38.987 --> 21:40.609
- Nothing happened to mine.

21:40.678 --> 21:42.784
- Yeah?
You should go find a mirror.

21:46.788 --> 21:47.823
- My dad's dying.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.757
- So is mine.

21:52.552 --> 21:55.106
- What's killing yours?

21:55.175 --> 21:56.176
- Heroin.

21:57.937 --> 21:58.972
What's killing yours?

22:00.388 --> 22:02.321
- The Twenty-first century.

22:04.909 --> 22:06.152
- You mean like... time?

22:09.362 --> 22:11.985
- Yeah, something like that.

22:12.779 --> 22:13.918
- How does time kill?

22:16.921 --> 22:22.202
- With my family it sort of
takes the kitchen sink approach.

22:23.928 --> 22:25.723
- Don't know what that means.

22:25.792 --> 22:27.138
- You need to study harder
in school, kid.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.383
- I dropped out of school.

22:32.178 --> 22:33.628
- Why'd you do that?

22:34.663 --> 22:36.562
- Cause... Fuck it.

22:38.736 --> 22:40.359
- That's a winning attitude.

22:42.084 --> 22:43.327
Well,

22:43.396 --> 22:45.191
the world needs
ditch diggers, too.

22:47.987 --> 22:49.333
- You got another one of those?

23:12.218 --> 23:13.322
You're pretty cool.

23:15.083 --> 23:17.775
- Let's be honest, you're
probably going to be in jail

23:17.844 --> 23:20.744
in a few years.
What's a cigarette gonna hurt?

23:20.813 --> 23:22.262
- Why do you say that?

23:22.331 --> 23:23.402
- Because your
life is a mess

23:23.471 --> 23:25.024
and you're perfectly
fine with it

23:25.093 --> 23:28.130
because you've had
no one to admire.

23:28.199 --> 23:30.305
No one to set an example.

23:30.374 --> 23:34.482
Now you're a lazy piece
of shit, right?

23:34.551 --> 23:37.346
But you're handsomish
and charming

23:37.416 --> 23:39.314
and smart enough
to bullshit your way

23:39.383 --> 23:41.178
out of any trouble
you get into.

23:41.247 --> 23:43.594
But one day you are gonna find
yourself some trouble

23:43.663 --> 23:45.665
that you can't bullshit
your way out of.

23:47.943 --> 23:49.393
- You a therapist?

23:53.259 --> 23:56.227
- I am the rock therapists
break themselves against.

23:57.781 --> 23:59.058
- You're pretty good at it.

24:00.646 --> 24:03.027
- Well, you're pretty
easy to analyze.

24:03.096 --> 24:05.513
I used to love guys like
you in high school.

24:05.582 --> 24:07.894
Give me a troubled loser
with blue eyes

24:07.963 --> 24:10.518
and I'd dry hump a hole
in his jeans.

24:10.587 --> 24:11.933
- What's dry hump?

24:14.522 --> 24:16.765
- How old are you?

24:16.834 --> 24:17.904
- 14.

24:17.973 --> 24:19.906
- Give me that
fucking cigarette.

24:20.942 --> 24:22.115
- The fuck?

24:24.877 --> 24:27.673
- Jesus, I thought you were 17.

24:27.742 --> 24:30.227
- You need to come inside.

24:30.296 --> 24:31.780
- Am I in trouble?

24:31.849 --> 24:33.748
- No, you're not in trouble.

24:35.577 --> 24:36.820
Are you a friend of the family?

24:41.514 --> 24:42.826
- I guess I am now.

24:44.172 --> 24:45.725
- You should come, too.

24:50.454 --> 24:52.352
- Shit.

24:52.421 --> 24:53.699
- Yeah.

25:15.962 --> 25:19.552
- So when these lines
move vertically,

25:19.621 --> 25:23.418
it's reading the electrical
impulses of the brain.

25:23.487 --> 25:26.766
And when they level
in this manner here,

25:26.835 --> 25:28.147
it is displaying a--

25:28.216 --> 25:29.597
- Just tell him, dude.

25:33.117 --> 25:35.119
- Well, there's no
brain activity.

25:35.188 --> 25:37.812
The only thing keeping your
father alive is the machine.

25:40.228 --> 25:41.401
- What does that mean?

25:43.265 --> 25:44.957
- Well, the lack of brain
activity would suggest--

25:45.026 --> 25:47.442
- It means he's gone, honey.

25:50.790 --> 25:52.723
Can he have some time
to say goodbye?

25:52.792 --> 25:54.069
- There's a protocol
we should discuss--

25:54.138 --> 25:55.174
- Yeah, no.
Not today there isn't.

25:55.243 --> 25:56.520
Get the fuck out.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.798
Get the fuck out
so he can say goodbye.

26:20.855 --> 26:21.994
Don't know what to say.

26:24.962 --> 26:27.033
- Say whatever you feel.

26:28.069 --> 26:29.518
That's what you say.

26:36.525 --> 26:37.734
Fuck you.

26:39.459 --> 26:43.084
Fuck you for leaving
me in this place

26:43.153 --> 26:45.742
with nothing and nobody.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.850
If there's a hell,
you're in it

26:52.990 --> 26:55.061
And I'll see you
when I get there.

26:59.410 --> 27:00.791
Son of a bitch.

27:11.837 --> 27:13.217
- That was a good speech.

27:16.186 --> 27:17.359
I like your style.

27:18.360 --> 27:19.776
- I don't have a style.

27:22.157 --> 27:23.331
- Yeah, you do.

27:55.052 --> 27:56.019
- Hit me.

27:56.088 --> 27:57.054
Come on now.

27:59.229 --> 28:01.818
Come on, come on now, baby.
Woo hoo!

28:01.887 --> 28:03.026
- Blackjack.

28:04.579 --> 28:06.063
- Come to papa.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.722
Mm! There you go.

28:09.791 --> 28:12.173
- Big spender.

28:12.242 --> 28:13.795
- You're welcome.

28:16.073 --> 28:17.040
Hey.

28:18.351 --> 28:21.147
Hey.

28:21.216 --> 28:24.461
I tip you every time I win
and all I been doing is winning.

28:24.530 --> 28:27.119
The least you can say
is thank you.

28:27.188 --> 28:28.707
- Thank you.

28:28.776 --> 28:30.225
- You're welcome.

28:34.402 --> 28:37.439
Ungrateful motherfuckers, man.

28:37.508 --> 28:40.166
We give you casinos,
free college,

28:40.235 --> 28:42.755
free fucking medical care.

28:42.824 --> 28:44.412
Don't know what
else you people want.

28:44.481 --> 28:47.864
- Gee, I don't know...
Maybe our land back?

28:47.933 --> 28:51.799
Think you can MacGyver
that up for us, Wasichu?

28:51.868 --> 28:53.076
- What's that mean?

28:53.145 --> 28:54.318
- Ain't a compliment.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.357
- You fucking people.

28:58.426 --> 29:00.669
Take, take, take, take,
take, take, take.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.085
Hey.

29:02.154 --> 29:03.293
I've done more to
get your land back

29:03.362 --> 29:04.881
than anybody in
the past century.

29:04.950 --> 29:06.986
- We don't have our land back.
John Dutton has our land.

29:07.055 --> 29:08.470
- Yeah, and where's he at?

29:08.539 --> 29:11.232
Rotting in a fucking bed,
waiting to die.

29:11.301 --> 29:13.786
So, you know.
You're welcome.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.377
- Are you saying
you shot John Dutton?

29:18.446 --> 29:19.827
- I'm just a
party planner, baby.

29:19.896 --> 29:21.311
I just put people together.

29:21.380 --> 29:23.831
What they do
is what they do...

29:23.900 --> 29:26.730
And what they did
was clear your land.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.283
You want it back?

29:28.352 --> 29:32.046
Stop your bitching, deal me
cards or go fucking get it.

29:47.889 --> 29:49.373
Woo!

29:52.652 --> 29:53.861
Meter maid?

29:54.931 --> 29:56.277
- Excuse me, sir.

29:56.346 --> 29:57.899
Could we speak to
you for a moment?

30:03.422 --> 30:04.561
- Speak.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.876
You gonna speak, fucking spea--

30:16.021 --> 30:17.401
- Sorry for the intrusion.

30:25.685 --> 30:26.963
- So who is he?

30:27.032 --> 30:28.447
- His name is Chester Spears.

30:28.516 --> 30:30.242
Dishonorable discharge
from the Army

30:30.311 --> 30:33.176
in 2006 for conduct unbecoming.

30:33.245 --> 30:35.419
Did three years in
Rock Springs for robbery.

30:35.488 --> 30:39.113
Another five years in Red Lodge
for aggravated assault.

30:39.182 --> 30:41.184
Has arrests for check fraud,

30:41.253 --> 30:44.532
wire fraud,
two DUI convictions.

30:44.601 --> 30:46.603
- TheGreat White Hopeless.

30:46.672 --> 30:49.295
Why am I looking at him?

30:49.364 --> 30:50.987
- He said he knows
who hit the Duttons.

30:51.056 --> 30:52.678
Bragged about
putting it together.

30:55.577 --> 30:58.753
- Putting it together?

30:58.822 --> 31:01.480
Ask him if he knows
who killed Kennedy.

31:01.549 --> 31:03.102
Probably tell you
he planned that, too.

31:05.346 --> 31:07.831
He's a drug dealer, Mo.
At best.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.213
- Drug dealers don't
gamble wads like this.

31:10.282 --> 31:11.697
Can't afford to lose it.

31:12.698 --> 31:14.527
- He didn't win that?

31:14.596 --> 31:17.116
- These are his winnings.

31:23.364 --> 31:26.574
- See if you can help him
separate fantasy from reality.

31:28.403 --> 31:31.717
- How much pressure
before we let him cry uncle?

31:31.786 --> 31:33.443
- What they did
to John Dutton

31:33.512 --> 31:37.033
hasn't been done since
they did it to us.

31:37.102 --> 31:40.174
We need to know who's
trying to take his land

31:40.243 --> 31:42.176
because they're coming
after ours next.

31:44.350 --> 31:45.662
No uncles for that one.

31:46.766 --> 31:47.906
- Okay.

31:50.115 --> 31:53.739
- But tradition,
I won't abandon.

31:55.085 --> 31:57.777
Do it the way we used to do it.

31:57.846 --> 32:00.470
Do it the way our grandfathers
did it.

32:09.444 --> 32:11.515
- Motherfucker!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

32:11.584 --> 32:12.896
I know your face!

32:12.965 --> 32:14.208
I know your fucking face!

32:14.277 --> 32:15.416
You can't fucking do this!

32:15.485 --> 32:16.831
- Why not?

32:16.900 --> 32:18.902
You've been doing it to us
for five hundred years.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.559
- Then kill me, motherfucker!

32:20.628 --> 32:22.285
Go on and kill me, then!

32:22.354 --> 32:24.735
Spend the rest of your
fucking life in a prison cell

32:24.804 --> 32:27.600
until they shoot bleach
in your veins

32:27.669 --> 32:30.431
and you piss yourself on
your way to fucking hell!

32:34.883 --> 32:37.714
- My mother was killed
by two white men

32:37.783 --> 32:41.166
who offered her a ride
when her car ran out of gas.

32:41.235 --> 32:43.651
I sat strapped
in a car seat for three days

32:43.720 --> 32:45.791
before someone found me.

32:45.860 --> 32:48.173
Hell is all I've ever known.

32:52.901 --> 32:54.386
- What are you doing?

32:54.455 --> 32:55.697
What are you fucking doing?

32:55.766 --> 32:56.940
We can talk about it.

33:18.513 --> 33:19.859
- So, you're the party planner.

33:21.482 --> 33:23.656
Tell me about this party
you planned for John Dutton.

33:25.900 --> 33:29.179
- I'm hurt here, man.
You really hurt--

33:29.248 --> 33:30.767
- Now you're hurt.

33:32.631 --> 33:34.633
Tell me about this party.

33:34.702 --> 33:37.567
Who wanted you to plan it?

33:37.636 --> 33:39.500
- If I tell you I'm a dead man.

33:39.569 --> 33:41.053
- You're already a dead man.

33:41.122 --> 33:43.193
Only question is how.

33:47.301 --> 33:49.130
- I don't wanna
fucking die, man.

33:49.199 --> 33:50.649
I don't wanna fucking die.

33:50.718 --> 33:51.960
- You a father?

33:53.548 --> 33:54.825
Love them?

33:59.899 --> 34:02.178
We're at war, you and me.

34:02.247 --> 34:05.767
When you die, I take the war
to your family.

34:05.836 --> 34:08.908
Stop thinking about yourself.

34:08.977 --> 34:10.945
Think about your family,

34:11.014 --> 34:13.051
and tell me something
that will save them.

34:35.003 --> 34:36.729
- Lloyd!

34:45.048 --> 34:47.292
Take Jake and Ethan
and head out to pasture nine.

34:47.361 --> 34:49.742
Start moving them heifers.

34:49.811 --> 34:52.366
- Three guys and
you're going to take seven

34:52.435 --> 34:53.643
to doctor these few cows.

34:53.712 --> 34:55.127
- Lloyd, the boss
is coming home today,

34:55.196 --> 34:56.301
and I want people around.

34:56.370 --> 34:58.682
You keep that between you and I.
Go on.

34:58.751 --> 35:01.444
- Jake, Ethan, you're with me.
Come on.

35:06.138 --> 35:07.174
- All right, come on.

35:07.243 --> 35:09.176
Colby, Teeter, Walker, let's go.

35:15.527 --> 35:16.666
Back

35:18.392 --> 35:19.496
There you go.

35:22.499 --> 35:25.468
I can do--
I can do this myself.

35:28.540 --> 35:31.439
Didn't think I was going
to make it, did you?

35:31.508 --> 35:33.579
- Never doubted it for a second.

35:33.648 --> 35:35.857
- Yeah. Liar.

35:35.926 --> 35:37.480
- Everyone else doubted.

35:37.549 --> 35:39.413
Not me. Not once.

35:41.863 --> 35:43.934
- I can...

35:44.003 --> 35:46.074
- We need you to lay down.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.179
- I know the drill.

36:05.680 --> 36:06.681
Yeah.

36:17.451 --> 36:20.764
How's the ranch?

36:20.833 --> 36:23.388
- We'll talk about the ranch
when we get there.

36:27.115 --> 36:30.015
- Good. Okay, let's try
the other side.

36:34.157 --> 36:35.193
- Stop.

36:37.229 --> 36:38.817
Back up.

36:45.617 --> 36:46.894
- Great.

36:47.929 --> 36:49.483
Oh, it's almost massage time.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.555
Then a bath.

36:53.935 --> 36:55.282
- What happened to him?

36:55.351 --> 36:57.732
<i>Dr. Plunkett,
Dr. Plunkett.</i>

36:57.801 --> 37:01.184
- It's on the list of things
we need to discuss.

37:01.253 --> 37:02.289
- A list of things.

37:02.358 --> 37:04.808
- A long list, Daddy.

37:04.877 --> 37:06.258
Come on.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.479
- All this for us?

37:20.548 --> 37:22.343
- I'll see you at the house.

37:22.412 --> 37:23.379
- All right, you don't
want to ride

37:23.448 --> 37:24.621
in this piece of shit anyway.

37:24.690 --> 37:26.830
Can we turn these
flashing lights off?

37:26.899 --> 37:28.832
Hey.

37:28.901 --> 37:29.902
Hey...

37:31.145 --> 37:33.043
All right, come here.

37:53.512 --> 37:55.514
- He's coming in!

38:48.395 --> 38:50.914
- One, two, three.

39:04.790 --> 39:07.241
- All right, I can walk
from here.

39:07.310 --> 39:09.139
Ow, God damn it.

39:09.208 --> 39:11.245
- Put him down.

39:11.314 --> 39:13.765
- I didn't get shot in my damn
legs, for hell's sake...

39:15.353 --> 39:16.423
Okay.

39:16.492 --> 39:18.148
Now what you going
to do, smarty?

39:18.217 --> 39:19.460
- Two, three.

39:22.221 --> 39:24.569
This is more fucking
dangerous than walking.

39:30.816 --> 39:32.715
No.
No, no.

39:32.784 --> 39:34.441
- Dad, you wanted to come home,

39:34.510 --> 39:36.546
this is what they
required to release you.

39:36.615 --> 39:38.306
- I'm released now, all right?

39:38.376 --> 39:39.860
Their requirements,
they don't matter.

39:39.929 --> 39:41.689
Get all this shit out of here.

39:41.758 --> 39:42.725
- Sir, we're required
to provide you

39:42.794 --> 39:43.829
with the same standard of care

39:43.898 --> 39:46.004
that you received
in the hospital.

39:46.073 --> 39:48.386
- Beth, get all this
shit out of here.

39:48.455 --> 39:49.801
I...

39:58.465 --> 40:00.777
Oh, God, no.
Let me do it.

40:04.850 --> 40:06.162
- He's got it.

40:06.231 --> 40:07.197
- There. You comfortable?

40:07.266 --> 40:09.717
- No.

40:09.786 --> 40:12.720
- Okay, he is all yours.
Have fun.

40:14.964 --> 40:17.622
- I'm Maggie.
I'm here to take care of you.

40:19.727 --> 40:22.350
You need anything,
just give that a little press.

40:23.628 --> 40:25.319
Okay, we'll have lunch
in a couple hours

40:25.388 --> 40:27.321
and then we'll get you bathed,
how does that sound?

40:33.603 --> 40:35.225
- Just get some rest.
- Mm-hmm.

40:37.089 --> 40:38.090
- Please.

41:17.820 --> 41:20.339
Oh, Mister Dutton!
No, no, no.

41:20.408 --> 41:21.824
No, go back to your room.

41:24.620 --> 41:25.897
Maggie...

41:27.830 --> 41:28.831
You're fired.

41:43.362 --> 41:44.571
- I think you should
stay in the lodge

41:44.640 --> 41:46.504
until I figure this thing out.

41:50.231 --> 41:54.995
- We've, uh... moved
into the Foreman's house.

41:55.064 --> 41:58.343
- Good. Good.
Cabin's too remote.

42:05.557 --> 42:06.731
- Cabin's gone, Daddy.

42:09.147 --> 42:10.873
They decided to kill that, too.

42:14.566 --> 42:16.085
- What...

42:17.155 --> 42:18.708
What else...

42:20.572 --> 42:22.712
What else did
they decide to kill?

42:25.059 --> 42:26.095
- You're home.

42:27.924 --> 42:31.134
I'd like to end
this day on a victory.

42:31.203 --> 42:33.171
We'll talk defeat tomorrow.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.590
- What are you hunting?

43:15.420 --> 43:16.766
- Whatever's hunting us.

43:20.528 --> 43:22.461
- No one will talk to me.

43:24.187 --> 43:25.879
Nobody will tell me
what happened.

43:27.639 --> 43:28.985
- I don't have the heart.

43:35.820 --> 43:37.407
They came after all of us.

43:39.547 --> 43:40.583
But we beat them.

43:42.309 --> 43:43.310
- All of them?

43:45.484 --> 43:46.589
- Every one they sent.

43:50.144 --> 43:53.423
- Well, you haven't got anything
until you get the sender, son.

43:53.492 --> 43:55.667
- Yeah.
Don't know the sender.

43:57.462 --> 43:59.084
- That's what
we figure out next.

43:59.153 --> 44:00.465
- Yeah.

44:15.998 --> 44:17.585
Goddamn, why does it feel like
the whole

44:17.655 --> 44:19.001
fucking ranch is on fire?

44:20.761 --> 44:22.314
- Burning brush piles.

44:22.383 --> 44:24.144
- Why are we
burning brush piles?

44:27.492 --> 44:28.666
- We ain't burning them, Dad.

44:51.240 --> 44:52.586
- Smart bird.

44:58.488 --> 45:00.836
- It's not an annexation issue,
it's a formation issue,

45:00.905 --> 45:04.494
and it's really a county
issue at this point, so...

45:04.563 --> 45:06.600
I would wait until
the development is built.

45:06.669 --> 45:09.120
Why incur the
added regulations?

45:09.189 --> 45:10.328
Uh-huh.

45:12.813 --> 45:14.608
Roarke, I'll have
to call you back.

45:17.438 --> 45:18.543
Let her in.

45:37.389 --> 45:40.047
- Could I have a moment alone
with my brother, please?

45:47.227 --> 45:51.990
So, we, uh... we had to clear
out your room.

45:52.059 --> 45:55.131
You know, for Daddy's
hospice bed, and I found...

45:55.200 --> 45:56.443
It's so cute.

45:56.512 --> 46:01.517
It reminded me of when
you were just a wee lad.

46:01.586 --> 46:02.587
- Son of a bitch...

46:02.656 --> 46:04.382
- No, that wasn't it.

46:04.451 --> 46:06.764
It was this...

46:10.043 --> 46:11.458
Look me in the fucking eyes.

46:11.527 --> 46:13.563
- You're fucking crazy
and I will have you arrested.

46:13.632 --> 46:16.049
- I've waited two months
for this moment, Jamie.

46:16.118 --> 46:19.880
Two months of praying
and bartering with God

46:19.949 --> 46:21.330
for his survival.

46:21.399 --> 46:22.780
And guess what?

46:24.540 --> 46:27.163
He did survive.

46:27.232 --> 46:28.820
I thought you'd like
to know that seeing as

46:28.889 --> 46:30.339
you never visited once.

46:30.408 --> 46:32.513
You never called once.

46:32.582 --> 46:35.413
- I called every day.
I just didn't call you.

46:40.349 --> 46:41.695
- It was you, wasn't it?

46:44.663 --> 46:46.596
- It was me what?

46:53.086 --> 46:54.363
- I want to tell you something.

46:56.675 --> 46:59.161
And it's for me,
it's not for you...

46:59.230 --> 47:02.095
See I want you to know it now,
so you can think about it...

47:05.029 --> 47:08.964
and not sleep
and worry and dread.

47:14.176 --> 47:15.384
I'm going to kill you.

47:17.317 --> 47:21.321
But when I do it, I'm not
going to farm it out like you,

47:21.390 --> 47:22.770
you fucking coward.

47:24.496 --> 47:26.498
I'm going to do it myself.

47:26.567 --> 47:28.086
- You think that I would--

47:28.155 --> 47:29.950
- I'm going to kill you, Jamie.

47:30.019 --> 47:33.402
I'm going to fucking kill you
for what you did to my family.

47:33.471 --> 47:34.748
- Think very hard about
what you're saying,

47:34.817 --> 47:36.129
you are threatening
a state official.

47:36.198 --> 47:38.476
- I am threatening
the whole fucking state.

48:29.044 --> 48:30.424
- No picnic working here, huh?

48:36.085 --> 48:37.638
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

48:37.707 --> 48:42.747
And I'm here to say thank you.

48:42.816 --> 48:44.991
I'm sorry people came
after you to get to me.

48:47.821 --> 48:49.236
That's not what you
signed up for.

48:49.305 --> 48:50.479
I'm sorry you...

48:52.067 --> 48:53.033
I'm sorry you went
through that.

48:55.380 --> 48:56.795
Now to thank you.

48:56.864 --> 48:59.902
And I mean it from

49:02.663 --> 49:04.182
thank you for fighting back.

49:07.185 --> 49:09.912
Thank you for
protecting this place,

49:09.981 --> 49:11.431
and protecting my family.

49:14.123 --> 49:15.193
I'll never forget it.

49:18.403 --> 49:21.303
Now you, uh...

49:21.372 --> 49:22.960
you stop worrying
about fighting.

49:25.341 --> 49:27.136
Worry about cowboying.
You leave the...

49:29.518 --> 49:30.968
You leave the fighting to me.

49:34.661 --> 49:38.492
Good Lord, looks like you boys
could use some beer, huh?

49:38.561 --> 49:40.598
Hmm.

49:40.667 --> 49:42.186
Oh my goodness.

49:49.227 --> 49:50.746
- You all right to drink, boss?

49:52.679 --> 49:55.716
- Lloyd, I've come to the
conclusion that the only thing

49:55.785 --> 49:59.134
on this earth that
can kill me is me.

50:00.411 --> 50:01.757
Any of you dipshits
feel like

50:01.826 --> 50:04.104
losing a weeks' wages
to the boss?

50:14.908 --> 50:18.601
Can someone explain to me how
this whole deal is working out?

50:18.670 --> 50:21.121
- Oh, that.

50:21.190 --> 50:24.262
Well, that's what you'd call
a constant state of evolution.

50:24.331 --> 50:28.542
- Well, look at the big
words from Jake.

50:28.611 --> 50:30.096
- Are we playing Hold 'Em?

50:30.165 --> 50:32.926
- We can play anything you
want to lose your money to.

50:32.995 --> 50:36.585
- Just to let you know,
when we play cards we like to...

50:36.654 --> 50:37.827
talk a lot of trash,

50:37.896 --> 50:39.208
so don't get your feelings
hurt, all right?

50:39.277 --> 50:40.658
- If one of you boys think
you can insult me,

50:40.727 --> 50:42.142
give it your best shot.

50:42.211 --> 50:43.661
- Don't mind if I do.

50:46.181 --> 50:48.528
- Alright.
The game's Hold 'Em.

50:51.496 --> 50:52.808
Three, six, king.

50:56.122 --> 50:57.606
- Got it.

51:14.174 --> 51:16.452
- Could you point me
to the restroom?

51:16.521 --> 51:18.592
- Yeah, it's just down
the hallway and to the right.

51:18.661 --> 51:21.181
- I'm going to go first.
Get me a beer.

51:30.087 --> 51:31.295
- Women.

51:33.159 --> 51:34.539
- Excuse me?

51:35.920 --> 51:37.542
- I said "women."

51:40.856 --> 51:42.029
- What about us?

51:44.066 --> 51:46.413
- Life is perspective
and you don't have any.

51:48.519 --> 51:50.003
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

51:50.072 --> 51:52.454
- I'm talking about your husband
leaving you here at the bar

51:52.523 --> 51:55.491
to buy him a drink
and do Kiegel exercises

51:55.560 --> 51:58.908
while he goes and
powders his nose...

51:58.977 --> 52:00.772
when it should be
the other way around.

52:04.190 --> 52:07.503
- Why...should it be
the other way around?

52:10.299 --> 52:13.095
- Because you have all the pussy
and half the money.

52:14.821 --> 52:15.856
That's why.

52:21.759 --> 52:22.725
- I never thought
of it like that.

52:22.794 --> 52:23.899
- Mm-hmm...

52:25.521 --> 52:26.936
It's perspective.

52:31.596 --> 52:32.735
- Where's your man?

52:34.806 --> 52:37.361
- He's on our porch
waiting for me to get home.

52:38.879 --> 52:41.330
- Why aren't you?

52:41.399 --> 52:42.607
- Because I'm in a bad mood.

52:44.644 --> 52:46.163
I don't like to take those home.

52:48.924 --> 52:49.925
- Where's my beer?

52:51.375 --> 52:53.963
- Order your own fucking beer.

52:54.032 --> 52:56.414
And get me a
skinny margarita with Tito's.

53:04.250 --> 53:06.252
- Oh, that cheered me up.

53:32.347 --> 53:33.934
Mmm...

53:39.354 --> 53:41.252
Oh...

53:42.288 --> 53:43.772
- Can't you just sleep in?

53:45.291 --> 53:46.602
- Not today, sweetie.

53:50.848 --> 53:52.505
- Are you telling me no?

53:54.507 --> 53:56.440
- Got something I need
to take care of.

54:04.862 --> 54:06.139
- Damn right, you do.

54:10.730 --> 54:12.628
You know, it's faster
just to fuck me

54:12.697 --> 54:15.735
than argue about fucking me
then still fucking me.

54:17.737 --> 54:20.015
Sweetheart, you don't know
what I have to do.

54:23.087 --> 54:24.226
- Something bad?

54:26.504 --> 54:29.473
- Yeah. Something bad.

54:31.992 --> 54:33.304
- More reason, then.

55:01.505 --> 55:02.471
- Excuse me.

55:04.370 --> 55:05.371
This yours?

55:05.440 --> 55:06.544
- What?

55:06.613 --> 55:08.857
- Found it up here on the bank.

55:08.926 --> 55:11.411
- It's not mine, man.

55:11.480 --> 55:12.964
- Not yours, huh?

55:13.033 --> 55:14.172
You sure?

55:15.864 --> 55:17.072
- I said it's not mine.

55:17.141 --> 55:18.176
What the hell
are you doing?

55:18.245 --> 55:20.765
- You sure it's not yours?
Huh?

55:20.834 --> 55:21.835
A little present
from the Yellowstone.

55:21.904 --> 55:23.389
- What? No!

55:23.458 --> 55:24.459
Ah!

56:03.912 --> 56:05.741
- Shouldn't be long now.

56:15.993 --> 56:17.477
Good riddance.
