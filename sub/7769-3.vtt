WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:02.940
I think we will lose this battle,
and a great many men will die.

00:04.945 --> 00:08.264
My God, Bolkonsky, what a shambles!

00:09.679 --> 00:11.295
How do you really feel about Sonya?

00:11.296 --> 00:13.303
I do love her, Tasha.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.104
I haven't been a very
affectionate husband...

00:17.105 --> 00:19.034
but it's no use saying that now.

00:21.269 --> 00:22.066
Here he is!

00:23.037 --> 00:25.904
Your wife is even more beautiful
than I remember, Bezukhov.

00:25.905 --> 00:28.824
To the health of beautiful women, Petrushka

00:28.825 --> 00:30.104
and their lovers.

00:30.105 --> 00:32.025
I challenge you!

01:24.065 --> 01:25.385
Count Bezukhov?

01:28.665 --> 01:30.305
If I might...

01:32.065 --> 01:36.624
Look here, you don't want to be
fighting a duel with this fellow.

01:36.625 --> 01:39.064
Apologise, say you lost your temper.

01:39.065 --> 01:41.145
No one will think any the worse of you.

01:42.430 --> 01:44.461
No. No, we're here now. Just
show me where I have to go.

01:45.086 --> 01:48.145
- Captain Dolokhov?
- Let's get on with it, shall we?

02:00.105 --> 02:02.104
If you could just remind me how, um...

02:03.025 --> 02:04.705
You point it, and... ?

02:05.905 --> 02:07.184
Oh, Lord.

02:07.185 --> 02:10.223
Hold out your arm straight in
front of you, as steady as you can.

02:10.225 --> 02:12.704
And squeeze the trigger, don't pull it.

02:12.705 --> 02:17.224
Turn sideways on  show him
your shoulder, not your chest.

02:17.225 --> 02:19.264
Don't give him an easy target.

02:19.265 --> 02:21.984
Thank you, I'd forgotten.
It's very kind of you.

02:21.985 --> 02:24.944
- There's still time to call it off.
- No.

02:24.945 --> 02:28.785
No, I know it's stupid, but I
think I must go through with it.

02:34.545 --> 02:35.985
Good luck, then.

02:42.097 --> 02:46.105
As the adversaries have refused a
reconciliation, we shall proceed.

02:47.860 --> 02:50.945
At the count of three, you
may advance towards each other.

02:51.259 --> 02:53.785
You may not go further than
the swords marking the barrier.

02:54.867 --> 02:58.593
After the count of three,
you may fire at any time.

03:10.890 --> 03:11.905
One.

03:14.015 --> 03:15.225
Two.

03:17.554 --> 03:18.265
Three.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.738
- Fedya!
- Get back!

03:52.801 --> 03:53.988
Dolokhov!

03:54.020 --> 03:57.984
No! Get back behind the barrier, damn you!

03:57.985 --> 04:00.305
It's not over yet.

04:21.777 --> 04:23.025
Turn! Cover yourself!

04:31.878 --> 04:32.774
Missed!

04:37.800 --> 04:41.704
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

04:41.705 --> 04:44.265
Death, lies!

04:48.508 --> 04:49.625
How bad is it?

04:51.105 --> 04:54.946
- If she sees me dying, it'll kill her.
- Who?

04:54.947 --> 04:57.784
My mother. My angel.

04:57.785 --> 05:00.704
She and my poor sister,
they're the only good things

05:00.705 --> 05:02.384
in my life, Rostov.

05:03.865 --> 05:05.225
The only ones I care for.

05:08.594 --> 05:10.624
I have to live, for them. You understand?

05:10.625 --> 05:12.024
Yes, I understand.

05:12.025 --> 05:13.465
Move, man!

05:28.465 --> 05:32.505
Stop it. You're not getting anything.

05:35.977 --> 05:36.860
Ah.

05:37.797 --> 05:39.105
Pierre.

05:43.865 --> 05:46.316
Well... I'll just...

05:53.652 --> 05:54.985
What have you done now?

05:57.605 --> 05:58.585
What have I done?

06:00.105 --> 06:03.825
You've made an exhibition
of yourself, and of me.

06:05.102 --> 06:08.184
Someone told you that Dolokhov was
my lover, and you believed them.

06:08.185 --> 06:10.744
Now you've made us the talk of all Moscow.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.384
Are you asking me to
believe that you're innocent?

06:13.385 --> 06:15.344
Of course I am innocent!

06:15.345 --> 06:18.655
Though no one would blame
me if I had taken a lover.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.874
It's not much fun being married to
a drunken oaf like you, you know.

06:22.655 --> 06:24.139
Most people think you're
half out of your wits.

06:24.164 --> 06:27.065
- Don't speak to me like that!
- Why shouldn't I speak?

06:27.948 --> 06:29.785
I am the injured party
here, after all, not you.

06:32.597 --> 06:34.409
How am I to go into society after all this?

06:36.113 --> 06:37.905
I never interfered with your pleasures.

06:41.552 --> 06:42.825
It's better that we part.

06:44.904 --> 06:45.802
What did you say?

06:45.857 --> 06:49.145
I said it's better that we part!
I'm leaving for Petersburg tomorrow.

06:52.541 --> 06:53.361
All right.

06:55.150 --> 06:56.305
If that's what you really want.

06:59.835 --> 07:01.882
You'll only expose
yourself to more ridicule.

07:02.507 --> 07:04.304
You know you'll have to
give me a fortune, don't you?

07:04.305 --> 07:05.704
I'll kill you!

07:07.425 --> 07:10.425
Out! Get out!

08:00.012 --> 08:01.664
A thousand apologies, Your Excellency,

08:01.665 --> 08:04.984
there will be a little
wait for fresh horses.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.784
It's nice and warm in the parlour,

08:06.785 --> 08:09.304
if you don't mind sharing
it with another gentleman.

08:09.305 --> 08:11.705
No, no I don't suppose
I have any choice, do I?

08:20.941 --> 08:22.145
Good evening.

08:22.519 --> 08:23.785
Evening.

08:45.465 --> 08:46.945
What?

08:50.121 --> 08:53.675
I believe I have the pleasure
of speaking with Count Bezukhov?

08:56.488 --> 08:58.624
I have heard about the misfortune
that has befallen you, sir,

08:58.625 --> 09:00.065
and I am very sorry for it.

09:01.145 --> 09:04.384
I should like to help you, if I can.

09:04.385 --> 09:06.417
But if for any reason

09:06.418 --> 09:09.385
you find conversation with
me unpleasant, please say so.

09:12.027 --> 09:12.865
No.

09:12.866 --> 09:15.184
No, I'm glad to make your acquaintance.

09:15.185 --> 09:17.745
Then let me offer you
a brotherly handshake.

09:22.607 --> 09:23.945
You're a Mason?

09:24.344 --> 09:28.266
Yes, I belong to the
brotherhood of Freemasons.

09:29.344 --> 09:32.544
I'm afraid my way of thinking
is very different from yours.

09:34.144 --> 09:35.703
I don't believe in God.

09:35.704 --> 09:37.343
Of course you don't.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.183
You don't believe in God
because you don't know him.

09:40.184 --> 09:42.463
And that's why you're so unhappy.

09:42.464 --> 09:46.943
I am unhappy  I should
think anyone could see that

09:46.944 --> 09:48.943
but what am I to do about it?

09:48.944 --> 09:51.823
How can I know God,

09:51.824 --> 09:55.983
if all my powers of reasoning
tell me he cannot exist?

09:55.984 --> 09:59.823
God is not apprehended by reason, my son,

09:59.824 --> 10:00.984
but by life.

10:02.744 --> 10:04.423
I don't understand you, sir.

10:04.424 --> 10:05.624
Well...

10:07.744 --> 10:12.823
... you are young, you are
rich, you are educated.

10:12.824 --> 10:15.583
What have you done with
all these good things

10:15.584 --> 10:17.584
that have been given you?

10:18.864 --> 10:20.264
Very little, so far.

10:21.384 --> 10:25.624
You need to purify yourself,
listen to your conscience.

10:26.664 --> 10:30.010
Look at yourself. Ask yourself,

10:30.565 --> 10:34.424
are you content with
yourself? With your life?

10:36.864 --> 10:39.503
No, I hate my life.

10:39.504 --> 10:41.903
I hate myself.

10:41.904 --> 10:44.063
Good.

10:44.064 --> 10:46.304
You have taken the first step.

11:26.984 --> 11:29.383
Your wound still troubles you?

11:29.384 --> 11:31.383
Yes, a little.

11:31.384 --> 11:34.263
- You still keep up a good pace, Father.
- Why would I not?

11:34.264 --> 11:36.263
I never vary!

11:36.264 --> 11:39.944
Work, exercise, a good night's
sleep that's all a man needs.

11:41.224 --> 11:44.743
What next for you? Back to the army?

11:44.744 --> 11:48.983
No. I've had enough for
now of dreams of glory.

11:48.984 --> 11:51.943
And Napoleon's wars seem
like nothing to do with us.

11:51.944 --> 11:55.294
- I'd like to make myself useful here.
- Good! Glad to hear it.

11:55.763 --> 11:57.341
Plenty here to keep you occupied.

11:57.824 --> 12:00.400
Build yourself a house
on the Bogucharovo estate.

12:01.447 --> 12:03.223
A man needs his own place.

12:03.224 --> 12:04.369
What do you say to that?

12:05.018 --> 12:07.344
- I think it's an excellent idea.
- Good!

12:16.784 --> 12:18.303
I've drawn up a list of economies

12:18.304 --> 12:19.854
I strongly recommend to Your Excellency.

12:19.855 --> 12:22.623
Yes, yes, but one doesn't
care to penny inch.

12:22.624 --> 12:24.863
One has to entertain the
odd guest now and then.

12:24.864 --> 12:28.343
- The position is really quite serious...
- All right, all right,

12:28.344 --> 12:31.143
austerity shall be our
watchword from now on, thank you.

12:31.144 --> 12:33.784
Thank you for your meticulous accounting.

12:35.144 --> 12:38.383
- I'll be good, I promise.
- Your Excellency.

12:41.144 --> 12:44.623
Well, what is it, my dear
boy, as if I couldn't guess?

12:44.624 --> 12:48.063
I'm sorry to have to ask, Father,
but I do find myself a little short.

12:48.064 --> 12:50.783
I've been helping Dolokhov with
his medical expenses, you see.

12:50.784 --> 12:53.246
- Ah, yes, how is the poor fellow?
- Oh, he's very much better.

12:53.684 --> 12:56.623
But he and his mother and sister,
they live in such a poor way,

12:56.624 --> 12:58.732
they can barely afford to heat their rooms.

12:58.810 --> 13:00.810
And you've been helping them.

13:00.984 --> 13:02.903
You're a generous hearted boy.

13:02.904 --> 13:06.303
Now, I can't spare you very
much just at the moment.

13:06.304 --> 13:08.783
Bakshin was very strict with me just now.

13:08.784 --> 13:11.183
Will 2,000 roubles be
sufficient for your needs?

13:11.184 --> 13:13.463
That will be ample,
Father you're very good.

13:13.464 --> 13:15.783
See if you can make it last till Spring.

13:15.784 --> 13:17.783
I give you my word that it will.

13:17.784 --> 13:20.663
And, Father, I should
like to invite Dolokhov

13:20.664 --> 13:23.423
to come and stay here for a
little while. May I do that?

13:23.424 --> 13:26.542
My dear boy, any friend
of yours is welcome here!

13:26.644 --> 13:27.597
Thank you.

13:34.704 --> 13:37.023
To the health and happiness of all,

13:37.024 --> 13:39.463
and the splendid recovery
of our young friend here!

13:39.464 --> 13:41.383
I can't thank you enough, Count Rostov,

13:41.384 --> 13:43.503
and you, Countess, for your kindness to me.

13:43.504 --> 13:44.983
Nonsense  it's our pleasure.

13:44.984 --> 13:47.023
You're one of the heroes of Austerlitz.

13:47.024 --> 13:49.823
Nothing to be proud of, sir I'm
just a man who loves to fight.

13:49.824 --> 13:51.463
It's all I know, to my shame.

13:51.464 --> 13:55.103
Don't disparage yourself, Fedya
none of us will believe it anyway.

13:55.104 --> 13:58.264
Then I'd better say
nothing about myself at all.

14:01.158 --> 14:03.864
How is your mazurka coming along, Natasha?

14:05.384 --> 14:07.663
Well, we thought we were doing very well,

14:07.664 --> 14:11.103
until Denisov told us we
were doing it all wrong.

14:12.944 --> 14:16.143
- You did.
- What do you know about it, Denisov?

14:16.144 --> 14:18.223
Oh, I was dancing the mazurka in Poland

14:18.224 --> 14:20.154
when you were still in petticoats, my boy!

14:20.232 --> 14:21.119
Really?

14:21.348 --> 14:24.623
The way they used to teach us in Poland...

14:24.624 --> 14:27.143
Have you always lived
with the family, Sonya?

14:27.144 --> 14:29.412
Yes, since I was a little girl.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.864
Nikolai speaks so warmly of
you, and now I can see why.

14:35.504 --> 14:37.046
I should like to know you better, Sonya.

14:37.445 --> 14:38.749
... It was the footman!

14:40.953 --> 14:43.664
Dolokhov watches you all the time.

14:44.398 --> 14:46.530
Doesn't it make you feel uncomfortable?

14:47.085 --> 14:50.704
Yes. But there's no harm in it.

14:51.812 --> 14:54.623
He can look all he likes.
It won't change anything.

14:54.624 --> 14:57.464
You're so sure of yourself.

14:58.435 --> 15:00.693
Mama says that girls are like mayflies.

15:01.724 --> 15:04.423
That they have their day in
the sun, and then it's over.

15:04.424 --> 15:06.184
It's more than a day.

15:06.551 --> 15:09.463
But how long? A year or two?

15:09.464 --> 15:11.663
To choose or be chosen.

15:11.664 --> 15:16.971
And then, that's our
lives settled... for ever.

15:17.885 --> 15:19.263
It's frightening.

15:19.264 --> 15:21.550
You just have to choose right, that's all.

15:22.526 --> 15:24.463
But how will I know?

15:24.464 --> 15:25.694
You will.

15:26.577 --> 15:27.984
But will I?

15:31.104 --> 15:33.575
I'm sorry, Nikki, I just don't like him.

15:33.576 --> 15:35.623
Why on Earth not? Everyone else does.

15:35.624 --> 15:39.247
- There's something cruel about him.
- Now you're just being ridiculous.

15:39.248 --> 15:42.103
- No, I'm not!
- He's the kindest, gentlest...

15:42.104 --> 15:44.703
If you could see him at home
with his mother and sister...

15:44.704 --> 15:48.263
Well, I don't know about that.
All I know is what I feel.

15:48.264 --> 15:53.023
And I'm sure Pierre was in the
right when he challenged him.

15:53.024 --> 15:54.983
Oh, Pierre! He's an idiot.

15:54.984 --> 15:57.095
No, he's not. I'd trust him with my life.

15:57.884 --> 15:59.184
Whereas, that one...

16:00.797 --> 16:02.781
... can't you see he's trying
to take Sonya from you?

16:03.476 --> 16:06.623
He's just being nice to
her. He likes you, too.

16:06.624 --> 16:08.183
No, he doesn't.

16:08.184 --> 16:12.532
And I'm not sure he likes
you, either  not really.

16:32.704 --> 16:34.504
You sure you're up to this, Fedya?

16:35.744 --> 16:37.144
Come again.

16:47.370 --> 16:49.104
Whoa!

16:51.944 --> 16:54.144
You'll have to show me how to do that one!

16:55.304 --> 16:56.864
Trade secret, my boy.

17:00.744 --> 17:03.463
Your cousin is a lovely girl, Rostov.

17:03.464 --> 17:05.743
And your sister, of course.

17:06.824 --> 17:08.784
I thought you were the man
that despised all women,

17:09.440 --> 17:13.223
- except his own mother and sister.
- I changed my mind, very recently.

17:13.223 --> 17:15.664
Innocence and purity are very rare.

17:17.223 --> 17:19.143
You've known these girls all your life,

17:19.144 --> 17:20.742
you take their qualities for granted.

17:21.844 --> 17:24.144
I suppose you're right. I've
never really thought about it.

17:25.664 --> 17:28.064
You see and feel very
deeply, don't you, Dolokhov?

17:28.578 --> 17:30.064
Some things.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.224
Some things.

17:36.148 --> 17:38.823
Aha! A mazurka!

17:38.824 --> 17:42.943
Aha! I knew we had one
somewhere! Come on, Denisov.

17:42.944 --> 17:45.943
We've heard you boasting, now
you can show us what you can do!

17:45.944 --> 17:47.943
- No, no, no.
- Yes! Make him, Father!

17:47.944 --> 17:50.023
No excuse, Denisov, you
might as well submit.

17:50.024 --> 17:52.703
Best idea all night. Oh, no!

18:56.984 --> 19:01.254
Denisov, you're a wonderful
dancer! I had no idea.

19:01.402 --> 19:03.983
For you  all for you.

19:03.984 --> 19:05.543
Oh, thank you.

19:05.544 --> 19:07.143
Now this, you absolutely deserve!

19:07.144 --> 19:10.344
Yes! Thank you. Shall we sit down?

19:22.304 --> 19:23.784
Countess.

19:25.424 --> 19:27.143
Natasha.

19:27.144 --> 19:29.704
If I don't speak now,
I'm afraid I never will.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.144
I adore you.

19:34.624 --> 19:37.103
I have never felt this way
about any woman or girl.

19:37.104 --> 19:40.303
I think about you all day
and dream of you at night.

19:40.304 --> 19:40.992
Oh, dear.

19:41.017 --> 19:44.983
I know I have no hope, but I must ask you.

19:44.984 --> 19:47.143
Will you make me the happiest man on earth

19:47.144 --> 19:48.704
and consent to be my wife?

19:50.064 --> 19:52.904
Oh... er...

19:54.304 --> 19:56.464
I wish you hadn't said that.

19:57.824 --> 19:58.944
I beg your pardon.

20:00.039 --> 20:02.132
- I couldn't help it.
- Dear Denisov.

20:02.664 --> 20:06.823
I'm so fond of you, but...

20:06.824 --> 20:09.624
I can't say it.

20:10.984 --> 20:12.198
Please.

20:13.143 --> 20:14.623
Forget about it.

20:14.624 --> 20:16.224
A moment of madness.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.304
All over now.

20:24.261 --> 20:25.824
Now, if you will excuse me...

20:58.550 --> 21:00.144
Now you must be blindfolded.

21:03.136 --> 21:03.917
Why is that?

21:05.277 --> 21:06.863
If you wish to join our brotherhood,

21:06.864 --> 21:09.784
you must be willing to submit
to our rituals without question.

21:11.384 --> 21:12.904
Are you willing?

21:15.641 --> 21:16.784
Yes.

21:18.184 --> 21:19.504
Yes.

21:28.624 --> 21:29.864
I will leave you now.

21:31.024 --> 21:33.263
When you hear knocking,

21:33.264 --> 21:35.544
you may remove the blindfold.

21:58.824 --> 22:00.973
Why have you come here?

22:01.544 --> 22:02.983
For wisdom?

22:02.984 --> 22:04.863
For virtue?

22:04.864 --> 22:06.624
For enlightenment?

22:08.104 --> 22:09.624
For renewal.

22:10.784 --> 22:12.024
I want renewal.

22:13.298 --> 22:17.063
Sic transit gloria mundi!

22:17.064 --> 22:19.703
Always aid your brother man.

22:19.704 --> 22:22.063
Raise up the fallen.

22:22.064 --> 22:24.423
Forgive your enemy.

22:24.424 --> 22:28.663
Take no revenge upon him,
unless it be but to do him good.

22:28.664 --> 22:32.063
Go out into the world now.

22:32.064 --> 22:37.384
Live not for yourself, but for others.

22:39.264 --> 22:44.303
You must be so happy that he has
decided to turn his back on society.

22:44.304 --> 22:47.463
Well, I won't say a word against
my husband, Anna Pavlovna,

22:47.464 --> 22:50.543
but truly it has been a bit
of a trial the last few months.

22:50.544 --> 22:53.103
I'm very glad to be back in Petersburg.

22:53.104 --> 22:57.663
And the Emperor himself has taken
an interest in your affairs, I hear.

22:57.664 --> 23:01.303
- Yes, he's been kind.
- More than kind, really.

23:01.304 --> 23:02.383
Vraiment?

23:02.384 --> 23:05.263
All the old crowd here, I see.

23:05.264 --> 23:09.703
Bilibin! Enchanting as ever, Comtesse.

23:09.704 --> 23:13.983
Well, I should hope so. But tell
me, who is that young man over there?

23:13.984 --> 23:16.263
Ah. Boris Drubestkoy.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.303
A very promising young man.

23:18.304 --> 23:21.343
Since Austerlitz, he's been
attached to the Prussian staff.

23:21.344 --> 23:23.023
Our oldest allies.

23:23.024 --> 23:26.463
They've only betrayed us four
times in the last three years,

23:26.464 --> 23:29.183
but now they're supposed to be
the solution to the eternal...

23:29.184 --> 23:32.383
Stop talking politics to
me, Bilibin, I can't bear it.

23:32.384 --> 23:34.903
Just introduce me to your little friend

23:34.904 --> 23:36.703
and make yourself scarce, hmm?

23:36.704 --> 23:38.183
Drubetskoy?

23:38.184 --> 23:39.464
Over here.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.823
Countess Bezukhova, may I
present Boris Drubetskoy,

23:43.824 --> 23:46.109
one of our most promising young diplomats?

23:46.867 --> 23:47.860
Enchante.

23:47.885 --> 23:49.823
And you're with the Prussian High Command?

23:49.824 --> 23:52.543
How exciting, to be so close
to all the decision makers.

23:52.544 --> 23:54.103
Do tell me about it.

23:54.104 --> 23:57.063
Are you interested in
politics, Countess Bezukhova?

23:57.064 --> 23:58.664
I adore politics.

24:00.384 --> 24:02.344
It's all so fascinating!

24:03.864 --> 24:06.221
Ah, Dolokhov, you'll never
guess who I just ran into!

24:06.784 --> 24:08.143
Dolokhov?

24:08.144 --> 24:10.263
What's the matter? What's going on?

24:10.264 --> 24:12.740
Did he tell you? No, he told me
nothing. What's this all about?

24:12.741 --> 24:14.423
There's been a bit of a scene.

24:14.424 --> 24:16.423
He's proposed to Sonya and she refused him.

24:16.424 --> 24:18.146
She told him she was in
love with someone else.

24:18.147 --> 24:20.423
You, of course, though she didn't say so.

24:20.424 --> 24:23.063
- He actually proposed to her?
- Yes! Couldn't you see it coming?

24:23.064 --> 24:25.743
Sometimes I don't think you see anything.

24:25.744 --> 24:27.823
Mamma's not pleased.

24:27.824 --> 24:29.943
She told Sonya that
Dolokhov's a very good match

24:29.944 --> 24:32.743
for a girl with no prospects.
But I'm glad she refused him.

24:32.744 --> 24:35.103
- Aren't you?
- Yes, yes, of course I am.

24:35.104 --> 24:37.023
But I should talk to her about it.

24:37.024 --> 24:38.424
Yes, I'll get her to come down.

24:54.744 --> 24:56.583
So, he really proposed to you?

24:56.584 --> 25:00.063
Yes. I didn't want him to.

25:00.064 --> 25:03.583
You know, as Mamma said, it
would be a good match for you.

25:03.584 --> 25:06.543
He's such a good fellow and a dear friend.

25:06.544 --> 25:09.263
I'd hate for you to feel as
though you'd missed an opportunity.

25:09.264 --> 25:13.463
I've already refused him. Nothing
could make me change my mind.

25:13.464 --> 25:15.823
He's been very kind to me,
but I could never love him,

25:15.824 --> 25:18.463
and I told him so. Sonya, if
you've refused him for my sake,

25:18.464 --> 25:19.668
- then I'm afraid...
- No, don't say that to me!

25:19.693 --> 25:21.716
No, but I must tell you
the whole truth. Look.

25:22.388 --> 25:25.943
I love you, I think, more
than anyone I've ever known.

25:25.944 --> 25:27.143
Well, that's enough for me.

25:27.144 --> 25:30.583
Yes, but I've fallen in love before
and I expect that I will again.

25:30.584 --> 25:32.344
I can't help it, it's the way I am.

25:33.824 --> 25:37.303
And then when Mamma
refuses to give her consent,

25:37.304 --> 25:40.863
you see, I'm not in a position
to promise you anything.

25:40.864 --> 25:43.943
- I don't ask you to, I never have.
- Yes, but I think you should consider

25:43.944 --> 25:45.584
Dolokhov's proposal.

25:48.064 --> 25:50.104
I'd rather not marry at all than marry him.

25:52.104 --> 25:54.943
I love you and I always will.

25:54.944 --> 26:01.504
But I don't ask anything of you.
I don't expect anything more.

26:03.784 --> 26:05.304
I don't deserve you.

26:07.824 --> 26:09.264
You're an angel.

26:23.544 --> 26:26.504
Good day, good day, I've come to
see how you're all getting along.

26:29.738 --> 26:31.783
These cottages look very bad, Grigori.

26:31.784 --> 26:34.143
They need new roofs, at the very least.

26:34.144 --> 26:36.743
Yes, indeed, your Excellency.
See you make a note of that.

26:36.744 --> 26:39.503
And here would be a
good place for a school.

26:39.504 --> 26:40.743
A school, your Excellency?

26:40.744 --> 26:43.223
Yes, indeed. Every boy should
have the chance to learn

26:43.224 --> 26:45.783
to read and write. And the girls, too.

26:45.784 --> 26:48.267
But where will the teacher
come from, your Excellency?

26:48.784 --> 26:50.744
Oh, there are teachers everywhere.

26:51.235 --> 26:53.823
Just build the school and
the teachers will come!

26:53.824 --> 26:56.024
Now! Grain stores.

26:59.144 --> 27:00.424
Hello.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.224
Grain stores.

27:16.246 --> 27:17.304
Oh, it's you.

27:19.664 --> 27:25.224
I'm so sorry, but did I
mistake the day? Or the time?

27:26.424 --> 27:28.184
No, I don't think so.

27:28.740 --> 27:32.184
It's just... where is everybody?

27:33.784 --> 27:35.943
Don't you think there are enough of us?

27:35.944 --> 27:39.506
Well, yes, of course.

27:40.967 --> 27:43.100
What did you think all this was about?

27:45.530 --> 27:46.944
Well...

27:48.904 --> 27:50.304
Are you hungry?

27:51.344 --> 27:55.144
Um... not particularly.

27:58.495 --> 27:59.464
Come on, then.

28:41.024 --> 28:43.383
All right, gentlemen, who's in?

28:43.384 --> 28:46.023
Ah, Rostov! The very man!

28:46.024 --> 28:49.063
Thank you for inviting me, Dolokhov.
You've been a stranger lately.

28:49.064 --> 28:50.354
I've been busy.

28:51.393 --> 28:54.788
But you're still my... I mean,
everything's all right between us?

28:54.789 --> 28:57.703
Why wouldn't it be? Why don't
you join us at the table?

28:57.704 --> 28:59.583
Or are you afraid of playing with me?

28:59.584 --> 29:02.463
I haven't any money with me.

29:02.464 --> 29:04.383
That's all right, I trust you.

29:04.384 --> 29:05.983
Play or not, it's all the same to me.

29:05.984 --> 29:07.873
But I tell you, if you
play with me, you'll lose.

29:07.898 --> 29:09.503
Ooh!

29:09.504 --> 29:11.063
Well, you don't know that.

29:11.064 --> 29:12.823
You know what they say about me?

29:12.824 --> 29:14.664
Dolokhov makes his own luck.

29:18.024 --> 29:20.904
- I'll play.
- Good man! Make some room for him.

29:22.544 --> 29:24.384
Stake your bets, gentlemen.

29:27.104 --> 29:28.744
Five roubles on the five.

29:30.224 --> 29:31.943
Three of hearts the soda.

29:31.944 --> 29:33.344
Ten wins.

29:34.664 --> 29:36.103
And five loses.

29:36.104 --> 29:39.143
All right, Rostov, I'm keeping tally.

29:39.144 --> 29:40.824
Stake your bets, gentlemen.

29:42.784 --> 29:44.264
Ten on the ace.

29:47.304 --> 29:49.024
Any more?

29:50.464 --> 29:52.063
All right.

29:52.064 --> 29:53.223
Seven...

29:53.224 --> 29:54.624
King...

29:55.904 --> 29:57.148
... and ace loses.

29:57.624 --> 29:59.143
Bad luck, Rostov.

29:59.144 --> 30:02.544
- Maybe it's not your night.
- Stake your bets, gentlemen.

30:04.104 --> 30:05.264
20 on the seven.

30:17.655 --> 30:19.464
That's how it goes sometimes.

30:20.864 --> 30:22.944
Perhaps you'd like to quit, Rostov?

30:29.264 --> 30:30.704
40 on the King.

30:33.064 --> 30:34.824
Place your bets.

30:36.144 --> 30:38.944
- 1,000 on the ace.
- Any more?

30:40.304 --> 30:42.303
Jack of diamonds.

30:42.304 --> 30:44.103
Three of spades.

30:44.104 --> 30:45.624
Ace of diamonds.

30:49.184 --> 30:51.304
So, how much do I owe you now?

32:19.944 --> 32:24.304
You have a lovely voice, Nikki we
should sing together more often!

32:25.424 --> 32:27.184
I have to go and speak to Father.

32:32.143 --> 32:34.703
Ah, the night bird!

32:34.704 --> 32:38.263
Home at last! Well, did
you have a good time?

32:38.264 --> 32:40.223
Not especially.

32:40.224 --> 32:42.459
Father, I'm afraid I'm going
to need some more money.

32:42.553 --> 32:43.701
Already?

32:43.984 --> 32:45.823
I had a feeling it wouldn't last you,

32:45.824 --> 32:46.956
but I didn't think it would be so soon!

32:47.706 --> 32:52.063
Well, you're only young once.
How much do you need, my boy?

32:52.064 --> 32:53.863
Well, it's rather a lot.

32:53.864 --> 32:56.904
Um, I lost a bit at cards, you see...

32:58.224 --> 33:00.303
That is, a good deal, a
very great deal actually.

33:00.304 --> 33:02.184
- How much?
- 43,000.

33:03.322 --> 33:04.090
What?

33:06.304 --> 33:07.340
To whom?

33:08.224 --> 33:10.623
43,000?! Are you joking?

33:10.624 --> 33:12.584
And I promised to pay tomorrow.

33:17.024 --> 33:18.464
Tomorrow.

33:19.687 --> 33:21.484
I suppose it happens to
everyone, at some point.

33:22.765 --> 33:23.744
Yes.

33:25.424 --> 33:27.504
Yes, I suppose these things do happen.

33:29.024 --> 33:30.344
It's a little difficult.

33:32.064 --> 33:35.544
We shall have to close up the
Moscow house and go to Otradnoe.

33:36.017 --> 33:36.784
Well...

33:38.814 --> 33:40.939
Well, it can't be helped.

33:41.963 --> 33:43.144
Can't be helped.

33:44.624 --> 33:47.743
Oh, Papa! Please forgive me  I'm so sorry!

33:47.744 --> 33:50.343
Forgive me, I'm sorry... I didn't mean..

33:50.344 --> 33:52.143
There, there.

33:52.144 --> 33:53.784
There, there.

33:59.744 --> 34:01.464
Well, here we are.

34:02.864 --> 34:06.263
We didn't exactly enhance our
reputations on leave, did we?

34:06.264 --> 34:07.919
I certainly didn't.

34:08.724 --> 34:11.105
When the leave's too long,
the soldier goes wrong.

34:12.824 --> 34:16.063
At least we know what we have
to do now  kill Frenchmen.

34:16.063 --> 34:17.583
We can do that.

34:19.784 --> 34:22.703
By the order of the Emperor Alexander,

34:22.704 --> 34:24.663
and by the grace of God,

34:24.664 --> 34:27.543
it is announced that a peace treaty

34:27.543 --> 34:31.303
has been ratified with
the Emperor of France,

34:31.304 --> 34:35.143
who will now be our gallant ally.

34:36.944 --> 34:41.422
The Emperor Napoleon has been
awarded the Order of St Andrew,

34:41.424 --> 34:47.422
as a mark of our nations' amity and accord.

34:47.424 --> 34:48.984
Thank you.

34:51.424 --> 34:53.382
Oh, excellent.

34:53.384 --> 34:54.902
What was that all about?

34:54.904 --> 34:58.063
The usual thing. We've changed sides.

34:58.064 --> 34:59.703
Our enemies are our friends now.

34:59.704 --> 35:02.983
- So we're friends with the French?
- I know, I know.

35:02.984 --> 35:06.344
It's a mad world. No
use trying to understand.

36:21.264 --> 36:24.143
Is Prince Andrei at
home? I'm an old friend.

36:24.144 --> 36:26.503
Yes, your Excellency. Shall
I tell him you're here?

36:26.504 --> 36:28.424
No, no, let me surprise him.

36:42.624 --> 36:43.672
Pierre!

36:44.922 --> 36:46.624
How unexpected!

36:48.064 --> 36:51.343
I'm delighted to see you!
What brings you to these parts?

36:51.344 --> 36:53.383
I've been making a tour of my estates,

36:53.384 --> 36:55.743
trying to make conditions
better for my serfs

36:55.744 --> 36:58.824
and my tenant farmers, make my
farms more efficient, and so on.

36:59.984 --> 37:03.143
Really, I've no idea what I'm doing.

37:03.144 --> 37:06.463
How are you? I've been
thinking about you so much,

37:06.464 --> 37:07.984
wondering what you've been up to!

37:09.424 --> 37:10.979
Not very much, is the short answer.

37:12.097 --> 37:14.824
Come, let's have
something to eat and drink.

37:16.584 --> 37:19.543
Yes, this is the life  bread and cheese,

37:19.544 --> 37:21.583
and wine, in moderation.

37:21.584 --> 37:23.424
To hell with high society!

37:25.144 --> 37:28.624
You know, you're exactly the
same. You haven't changed a bit!

37:29.944 --> 37:31.623
Do you think so?

37:31.624 --> 37:35.904
In myself, I believe I've changed
a great deal  and for the better.

37:37.984 --> 37:40.024
I heard about your marriage.

37:41.064 --> 37:42.668
And how it ended?

37:43.605 --> 37:44.926
You heard about the duel?

37:45.691 --> 37:47.512
Yes, you had to go through that, too.

37:48.403 --> 37:51.783
The one thing I thank God for
is that I didn't kill that man.

37:51.784 --> 37:54.263
Why so? If a dog is vicious,
he's better off dead.

37:54.264 --> 37:57.383
But to take a man's life,
that must always be wrong.

37:57.384 --> 38:00.583
Why must it always be
wrong? For you, perhaps.

38:00.584 --> 38:03.968
For me, there are only two evils

38:05.093 --> 38:07.624
sickness and remorse.

38:09.680 --> 38:13.144
Since Lise died, I have
been wracked with remorse.

38:16.784 --> 38:19.184
I treated her unkindly and now she's gone.

38:20.824 --> 38:22.144
Disappeared into nowhere.

38:24.064 --> 38:25.904
No way for me to make amends.

38:31.264 --> 38:34.824
I've been staring into the abyss, Pierre.

38:38.384 --> 38:41.566
So now, my sole aim is to live for myself.

38:42.550 --> 38:43.663
To do as little harm as possible

38:43.664 --> 38:46.223
and to have as little to do
with other people as I can.

38:46.224 --> 38:48.527
No, I can't agree. That wouldn't be enough.

38:49.379 --> 38:52.423
I used to live for myself
and I ruined my life.

38:52.424 --> 38:56.543
Now, I try to think of others,
actively try to help them,

38:56.544 --> 38:58.180
and I'm much happier for it.

38:58.930 --> 39:01.383
Anyway, you don't live just for yourself!

39:01.384 --> 39:04.503
What about your sister,
your father, your little son?

39:04.504 --> 39:05.968
They are a part of myself.

39:07.249 --> 39:09.783
All right, I concede, one
can't avoid the world entirely,

39:09.784 --> 39:11.103
but I do my best.

39:11.104 --> 39:13.904
I look after my estate, I take
care of my sister and my son,

39:14.464 --> 39:16.583
I serve in the local
militia with my father.

39:16.584 --> 39:19.263
- And that is enough for me.
- You won't go back to the army?

39:19.264 --> 39:21.623
After Austerlitz? No, thanks.

39:21.624 --> 39:24.904
The pursuit of military
glory disgusts me now.

39:26.384 --> 39:28.503
And besides, Kutuzov was our last good man,

39:28.504 --> 39:29.863
and now the Tsar's demoted him.

39:29.864 --> 39:31.743
And what about yourself?

39:31.744 --> 39:35.183
You have so much to give.
Marry again, why not?

39:35.184 --> 39:36.863
And make some other poor girl unhappy?

39:37.941 --> 39:40.744
I'm surprised to hear you
recommend marriage, Pierre.

39:42.464 --> 39:45.704
We neither of us distinguished
ourselves there, did we?

39:53.409 --> 39:55.983
Look, I must say this to you.
We've had all these conversations

39:55.984 --> 39:58.303
and you've been talking
as if your life is over,

39:58.304 --> 39:59.771
but you're a young man still.

40:00.420 --> 40:02.743
You know, so many good
things can happen for you.

40:02.744 --> 40:05.543
Since I became a Mason and
started to live a good life,

40:05.544 --> 40:07.035
I feel capable of anything!

40:07.839 --> 40:09.363
We must live.

40:10.269 --> 40:11.746
You know, we must love.

40:12.863 --> 40:15.223
And we must believe

40:15.224 --> 40:18.383
that there's more to it all than
our lives on this scrap of earth.

40:18.384 --> 40:21.024
There's something else out
there it is true, Andrei.

40:22.744 --> 40:24.304
You must believe it.

40:32.064 --> 40:34.184
Yes, if only it were so.

40:40.744 --> 40:44.903
Pierre, I'd like you to meet my son.

40:44.904 --> 40:49.224
And it must be years since my
father and my sister set eyes on you.

40:50.304 --> 40:52.103
Can you spare the time?

40:52.104 --> 40:54.464
For you, I've all the time in the world.

41:07.224 --> 41:09.304
He's a funny fish.

41:11.944 --> 41:13.983
He makes a funny face!

41:15.744 --> 41:18.144
How do you find Andrei?

41:19.184 --> 41:21.343
He worries me so much.

41:21.344 --> 41:23.583
Today, he's merry and lively,

41:23.584 --> 41:25.520
but that's just your effect on him.

41:26.137 --> 41:27.426
He is unhappy.

41:29.424 --> 41:32.103
But it's not as though he's
doing nothing, Princess.

41:32.104 --> 41:33.184
I know.

41:34.464 --> 41:36.344
He does everything well.

41:38.264 --> 41:41.064
But it's as if the soul
has gone out of him.

41:45.264 --> 41:46.823
My father's home.

41:46.824 --> 41:49.744
Oh! Do you want to go and
say hello to your grandfather?

42:02.957 --> 42:04.663
'No more war?'

42:04.664 --> 42:07.103
This peace treaty with France
won't last. Mark my words,

42:07.104 --> 42:09.863
we'll be fighting Napoleon
again before you're much older!

42:09.864 --> 42:13.703
No, sir! We must believe the
man is capable of evolving.

42:13.704 --> 42:14.820
Evolving?

42:15.156 --> 42:16.823
Men don't change!

42:16.824 --> 42:19.623
If you could drain the blood
from their veins and put in water,

42:19.624 --> 42:20.859
there might be no war!

42:21.464 --> 42:23.983
You're talking old women's nonsense, sir,

42:23.984 --> 42:27.944
but I'm happy to see that there are
still a few idealists left on Earth.

42:29.864 --> 42:31.743
I want you to go to Otradnoe.

42:31.744 --> 42:33.863
The marshal there, Count Rostov,

42:33.864 --> 42:36.448
has failed to produce half
the men required of him.

42:37.042 --> 42:38.783
The army still needs to be maintained,

42:38.784 --> 42:41.103
even in this time of so called peace.

42:41.104 --> 42:43.504
Rostov needs someone
to ginger him up a bit.

42:44.069 --> 42:45.064
Do you know the man, at all?

42:45.065 --> 42:46.983
- No, I don't.
- I do.

42:46.984 --> 42:50.863
He's a very good man.
Not practical, I suppose,

42:50.864 --> 42:53.183
but who am I to talk of such things?

42:53.184 --> 42:56.303
I'm very fond of him. The
whole family are delightful.

42:56.304 --> 42:59.184
Well, there you are. You can
mix business with pleasure!

43:26.853 --> 43:29.263
Do tell your father that
I shall do my very best to

43:29.264 --> 43:32.623
make my contribution to the
militia. I've been very lax.

43:32.624 --> 43:35.903
Do you know, I moved the family
to the country to save money,

43:35.904 --> 43:38.143
but somehow, I've been
doing more entertaining here

43:38.144 --> 43:41.143
than I ever did in Moscow  hunts,
theatricals, dinners, musicians,

43:41.144 --> 43:42.583
endless guests coming to stay...

43:42.584 --> 43:44.543
Well, I shan't be any
further burden to you...

43:44.544 --> 43:46.943
Oh, no, no, no, my dear
fellow, I didn't mean you.

43:46.944 --> 43:47.833
Of course, you must stay the night.

43:48.704 --> 43:51.144
And as long as you wish!

43:52.384 --> 43:54.743
And you needn't be talking
to boring old men like me,

43:54.744 --> 43:56.619
I've seen you looking
at those lovely girls.

43:57.504 --> 44:01.064
Natasha! Stop that, my
darling, and come over here.

44:06.024 --> 44:08.063
My daughter, Natalia.

44:08.064 --> 44:10.504
Natasha, this is Prince Andrei Bolkonsky,

44:11.117 --> 44:13.024
one of the great heroes of Austerlitz.

44:13.625 --> 44:15.544
I'm happy to make your acquaintance, sir.

44:20.024 --> 44:22.234
I think I saw you before, didn't I?

44:23.016 --> 44:24.144
Yes.

44:25.196 --> 44:27.159
Yes, you looked at me so severely!

44:27.774 --> 44:28.863
No, not at all.

44:28.864 --> 44:31.384
Not severely. At least, I hope not.

44:32.704 --> 44:36.423
Go and take him away and talk to
him, Natasha. He's had enough of me.

44:45.184 --> 44:48.343
Are you the Prince Andrei that
Pierre Bezukhov talks about?

44:48.344 --> 44:49.864
He is my greatest friend.

44:51.424 --> 44:54.824
He loves you very dearly.
I think you're his hero.

44:56.264 --> 44:57.863
Have you seen him lately?

44:57.864 --> 45:01.583
He's had so much trouble, I
think, and none of it his fault.

45:01.584 --> 45:03.234
I saw him just before I came here.

45:04.226 --> 45:06.943
I believe he's put his
sorrows behind him now

45:06.944 --> 45:11.944
he's full of great plans
and love for his fellow man.

45:12.370 --> 45:15.425
Yes. Yes, that's just like him.

45:16.057 --> 45:18.144
I so want him to be happy.

45:19.544 --> 45:20.815
Like you.

45:21.584 --> 45:25.384
You seem to have the gift of happiness.

45:27.584 --> 45:28.799
Don't we all have it?

45:29.940 --> 45:31.624
Somewhere within us?

45:45.784 --> 45:49.063
Come on, please? One more time!

45:49.064 --> 45:52.224
Yes, all right, but then
I'm blowing the candles out.

46:39.784 --> 46:41.823
That's it  I'm going to sleep now.

46:41.824 --> 46:43.863
Oh, Sonya, how can you sleep?

46:43.864 --> 46:46.424
I feel as if I'm going
to stay awake till dawn.

46:48.064 --> 46:49.863
Look at that lovely moon.

46:49.864 --> 46:53.323
I don't think it's the moon
that's keeping you awake.

46:54.018 --> 46:55.184
What, then?

46:57.550 --> 46:58.737
Do you like him very much?

46:59.597 --> 47:00.565
More than Boris?

47:01.151 --> 47:02.904
Yes, much more.

47:04.104 --> 47:06.543
There's something so sad about him,

47:06.544 --> 47:08.079
and that frightens me a little.

47:08.892 --> 47:11.383
But he's going away, and
we're leaving for Petersburg

47:11.384 --> 47:12.647
I don't suppose I'll ever see him again.

47:14.624 --> 47:17.023
Oh, Sonya, I wish I could fly away.

47:17.024 --> 47:20.023
Shall I try? Would the air carry me?

47:20.024 --> 47:21.783
Don't be a fool!

47:21.784 --> 47:26.184
- Come to bed now.
- Oh, if you insist.

48:15.146 --> 48:19.263
I understand you have made a
great effort to change your life.

48:19.264 --> 48:20.758
That's very commendable.

48:21.547 --> 48:23.109
How do you feel about yourself?

48:23.984 --> 48:26.555
Well, I can look at
myself without disgust now.

48:27.224 --> 48:30.704
But... still not happy.

48:32.224 --> 48:33.665
Not at all.

48:34.564 --> 48:37.384
I sleep badly, I wake
with fearful thoughts.

48:39.224 --> 48:41.104
What's the matter with me?

48:43.904 --> 48:48.583
Perhaps you are changing your world,

48:48.584 --> 48:50.664
and forgetting to change yourself.

48:52.704 --> 48:56.784
Do you try to forgive
those who have wounded you?

48:59.984 --> 49:04.143
"My dear Helene, I believe we
should resume married life together,"

49:04.144 --> 49:05.944
"if that is agreeable to you."

49:08.304 --> 49:11.503
"I ask you to forgive me
for hurting your feelings,"

49:11.504 --> 49:13.543
"and for any damage to your reputation"

49:13.544 --> 49:15.263
"that my conduct may have caused."

49:15.264 --> 49:17.343
Thank you, dear Pierre.

49:17.344 --> 49:21.903
"I am a better person now, I hope,
than I was when we last spoke."

49:21.904 --> 49:24.944
I can't believe you're back with Bezukhov.

49:27.784 --> 49:32.063
No need to sound so shocked.
It makes perfect sense.

49:32.064 --> 49:35.303
We're not sharing a bed, it's
just for appearance's sake.

49:35.304 --> 49:36.943
So, nothing needs to change.

49:36.944 --> 49:38.543
Come back to bed.

49:38.544 --> 49:40.303
No, I've got too much on this morning.

49:40.304 --> 49:42.183
Did you know the Rostovs are back in town?

49:42.184 --> 49:44.023
I had heard, yes.

49:44.024 --> 49:46.241
Aren't you supposed to be
engaged to the daughter?

49:47.077 --> 49:48.863
That was just a childish thing.

49:48.864 --> 49:50.303
Does she know that?

49:50.304 --> 49:52.183
I should make it clear if I were you

49:52.184 --> 49:54.783
you can't afford to be engaged
to a girl with no money.

49:54.784 --> 49:56.863
You're not jealous, by any chance, are you?

49:56.864 --> 49:57.746
Me? Jealous?

49:58.567 --> 50:00.223
Of the little Rostov girl?

50:00.224 --> 50:01.645
You're very sweet.

50:02.661 --> 50:03.944
You can see yourself out.

50:04.457 --> 50:05.270
Wait!

50:06.200 --> 50:08.119
I'll see you at the Tsar's ball?

50:08.144 --> 50:10.703
Well, you shall see me, but
you're not to talk to me,

50:10.704 --> 50:12.503
much less touch me.

50:12.504 --> 50:15.423
I shall be otherwise engaged,
and you need to find yourself

50:15.424 --> 50:17.903
a pretty little heiress to
charm out of her petticoat.

50:17.904 --> 50:19.842
- Think you can do that?
- I don't want to do that.

50:20.646 --> 50:21.529
I want you.

50:21.864 --> 50:23.264
Sweet boy.

50:43.304 --> 50:44.490
I'm so nervous!

50:45.504 --> 50:48.823
I've been awake for hours, thinking
about the Tsar's ball tonight.

50:48.824 --> 50:52.106
Oh, but you've got nothing
to be nervous about.

50:52.904 --> 50:57.503
It is important, my darling,
for you and for Sonya

50:57.504 --> 51:00.681
the first time you'll be
seen in Petersburg society.

51:01.361 --> 51:03.322
Everyone's eyes will be on you.

51:05.264 --> 51:07.103
So, keep a clear head,

51:07.104 --> 51:10.224
and don't fall for the first
boy who asks you to dance.

51:11.584 --> 51:13.498
- Do you think he might be there?
- Who?

51:14.733 --> 51:17.143
You know, Mamma!

51:17.144 --> 51:19.703
Prince Andrei Bolkonsky.

51:19.704 --> 51:23.384
If God wills it, he'll be there,

51:24.032 --> 51:25.344
and you'll dance with him.

51:26.784 --> 51:29.424
Now, close your eyes.

52:20.864 --> 52:23.623
- Look at those two.
- Ah!

52:23.624 --> 52:25.344
Charmantes!

52:26.944 --> 52:29.143
There's so many French here.

52:29.144 --> 52:32.503
- As if nothing ever changed.
- It won't last.

52:32.504 --> 52:35.263
Napoleon won't be able to resist
the temptation to invade Russia

52:35.264 --> 52:38.743
- for much longer.
- Oh! Bilibin, don't say that.

52:38.744 --> 52:41.743
Well, it's his nature. He's like
the scorpion  he has to sting,

52:41.744 --> 52:43.183
he can't help it.

52:43.184 --> 52:46.064
Ah! The Queen of Petersburg!

52:47.664 --> 52:50.104
His Imperial Majesty, The Tsar.

53:31.864 --> 53:33.663
Old friend! Pierre!

53:33.664 --> 53:35.343
How are you?

53:35.344 --> 53:37.063
I'm very well.

53:37.064 --> 53:40.503
Yes  I see something's changed in you.

53:40.504 --> 53:43.423
I keep hearing reports you're
making waves in the court circles,

53:43.424 --> 53:45.063
reforming the army.

53:45.064 --> 53:47.544
The old spark's burning
bright again, isn't it?

53:48.864 --> 53:50.783
You could put it like that.

53:50.784 --> 53:52.624
And what about you?

53:54.104 --> 53:57.623
Oh, you don't want to hear about me.

53:57.624 --> 54:00.584
I'm very happy to see you again.

54:15.344 --> 54:16.904
May I have this dance?

54:28.104 --> 54:30.664
- May I take your hand for this dance?
- Of course.

54:47.704 --> 54:49.504
Countess Rostova.

54:50.664 --> 54:54.703
May I request the pleasure of a
dance with your daughter, Natalia?

54:54.704 --> 54:57.504
Of course! She'll be delighted.

56:51.184 --> 56:53.184
It's him!

57:39.104 --> 57:43.543
I had no idea, Pierre. I've never
experienced anything like it before.

57:43.544 --> 57:45.183
Like what, exactly?

57:45.184 --> 57:47.023
I'm in love, my friend!

57:47.024 --> 57:49.863
Yes. With Natasha Rostova, yes?

57:49.864 --> 57:54.663
Yes, who else? I feel like I've
never been properly alive before.

57:54.664 --> 57:57.233
I feel I can't live without her, Pierre!

57:57.904 --> 58:00.663
But could she love me?
Might she think I'm too old.

58:00.664 --> 58:02.704
I am too old! What do you think?

58:04.544 --> 58:06.024
Why don't you speak?

58:07.984 --> 58:10.064
The girl is a treasure, Andrei.

58:11.104 --> 58:13.624
She's one of a kind. She's a treasure.

58:15.744 --> 58:19.103
Look, if you truly love
her, don't hesitate,

58:19.104 --> 58:21.863
don't think about it.
Follow your heart, marry her.

58:21.864 --> 58:23.983
Marry her tomorrow you'll never regret it!

58:23.984 --> 58:26.542
- But could she love me, Pierre?
- She loves you all right.

58:26.543 --> 58:29.024
She hardly knows me... She
loves you! I know it! All right?

58:30.104 --> 58:32.784
I could see it in her face
when she was dancing with you.

58:33.378 --> 58:35.103
I've never seen her look like that before,

58:35.104 --> 58:37.384
and I've known her since she was a child.

58:38.384 --> 58:39.998
She loves you, Andrei.

58:41.131 --> 58:42.904
And you're the luckiest man on Earth.

58:44.864 --> 58:46.943
So, what are you doing talking to me?

58:46.944 --> 58:48.344
Go to her!

58:49.904 --> 58:52.423
Go to her, don't let her get away.

58:52.424 --> 58:54.064
Propose to her.

58:57.928 --> 58:59.504
I will.
