20:09.842 --> 20:11.142
I don't suppose we're here

20:11.211 --> 20:12.843
for milk and cookies,
right?

20:12.912 --> 20:13.844
(Bernard)
We're here for...

20:13.913 --> 20:15.079
Come on.

20:15.148 --> 20:16.414
(Bernard)
... 'cause
we're on the brink

20:16.482 --> 20:19.217
of an unprecedented moment
for the relatives.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.585
The relatives
have never been

20:20.653 --> 20:22.420
without an effective
leader.

20:22.488 --> 20:23.854
(Diane)
Erik is our leader.

20:23.923 --> 20:24.855
Interim leader.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.626
And chances are,
this time tomorrow,

20:28.695 --> 20:29.627
he'll be in prison.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.329
He's innocent.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.730
He'll be back.

20:32.799 --> 20:33.931
(Bernard)
We all care about Erik.

20:35.668 --> 20:36.901
We all hope he's
found innocent.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.405
The past few
weeks have shown us

20:41.474 --> 20:42.573
how vulnerable
we are.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.110
We all care about Erik.

20:46.179 --> 20:49.847
But his actions lately
have been... dubious,

20:49.916 --> 20:52.683
and his children
have been quite a nuisance.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.655
Always trespassing,
breaking the rules.

21:00.193 --> 21:02.293
(Diane)
So, who would you
propose to be the next

21:02.362 --> 21:04.629
leader of the relatives?

21:04.697 --> 21:06.297
Martin...

21:06.366 --> 21:09.367
Rinus... me?

21:09.435 --> 21:10.935
(Bernard)
That is an
excellent question.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.272
I think we'd all be
excellent candidates.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.675
I think it's coming
from there.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.043
(Bernard)
Rinus is the oldest.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.146
He's seen the most.

21:22.215 --> 21:23.281
Martin...

21:25.451 --> 21:26.384
... possibly the smartest.

21:28.021 --> 21:29.387
And you, Diane,

21:29.455 --> 21:31.722
always fare and sharp
in your judgment.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.527
To-- to be honest...

21:36.596 --> 21:39.063
I think I'd be
a great leader myself.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.903
After all, I've been doing
most of the tasks

21:45.972 --> 21:47.538
for the past
couple of months.

21:48.741 --> 21:51.075
So, this is why you
called us here.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.943
Well, I don't think
it's useful for us

21:53.012 --> 21:53.978
to wait any longer.

21:54.047 --> 21:54.979
Okay.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.351
Stop!
