00:01.169 --> 00:03.215
<i>Previously on</i>
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.298 --> 00:04.885
<i>This morning,</i>
a plane left Gilead

00:04.927 --> 00:06.262
<i>and landed at Pearson.</i>

00:06.304 --> 00:08.266
<i>There were nine Marthas onboard.</i>

00:08.350 --> 00:10.187
There were also 86 children.

00:10.187 --> 00:11.022
<i>Offred.</i>

00:11.690 --> 00:13.026
This will start a war.

00:13.109 --> 00:14.947
<i>You got</i>
those children out, dear.

00:15.030 --> 00:16.534
He sent me dreams of you.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.286
We were killing people together.

00:18.411 --> 00:21.877
You have to save yourself.
I'll be fine.

00:21.877 --> 00:22.921
What have you done?

00:23.004 --> 00:24.257
I want to be with my daughter.

00:24.340 --> 00:26.469
I have
some information to report.

00:26.595 --> 00:29.267
Serious crimes
committed by my wife.

00:29.350 --> 00:30.812
I'm placing you under arrest.

00:30.895 --> 00:33.358
You forced your driver
to impregnate Ms. Osborn

00:33.358 --> 00:35.279
so you could claim
the resulting child.

00:35.362 --> 00:36.907
I want to hurt them so badly.

00:37.701 --> 00:39.997
Gilead, the men.

00:40.665 --> 00:41.792
<i>What did he do to you?</i>

00:42.418 --> 00:44.965
He would bring in other men.

00:46.927 --> 00:50.225
You know, Guardians. Eyes.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.939
<i>Even some Commanders.</i>

00:53.106 --> 00:54.985
‐Is he one of them?
‐

00:57.031 --> 00:59.368
‐Do we know his name?
‐Guardian Pogue.

00:59.452 --> 01:00.580
<i>Put him in the barn.</i>

01:00.663 --> 01:02.333
‐
‐<i>We're Mayday.</i>

01:03.711 --> 01:06.382
We don't hide. We fight.

01:07.009 --> 01:08.638
Make me proud.

01:09.806 --> 01:10.892
I will.

01:10.975 --> 01:12.353
She's out there planning

01:12.436 --> 01:14.733
who knows
what kind of atrocities

01:14.816 --> 01:18.239
to visit upon
our righteous nation.

01:18.824 --> 01:21.538
<i>Find her and bring her to me.</i>

01:21.622 --> 01:24.335
‐

01:48.383 --> 01:49.719
Okay, go.

01:58.486 --> 01:59.698
They're here for us.

01:59.781 --> 02:01.409
Nope. Not with just one car.

02:01.743 --> 02:03.413
Just stay calm and keep working.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.002
Janine, come here.

02:06.837 --> 02:08.131
‐Come with me.
‐Okay.

02:08.757 --> 02:10.343
I need you not to run, okay?

02:10.427 --> 02:11.680
‐Okay.
‐Okay.

02:13.016 --> 02:14.101
Come here.

02:19.946 --> 02:20.865
Blessed day, ma'am.

02:29.298 --> 02:31.804
Look at me.
It's gonna be all right.

02:31.929 --> 02:33.056
‐Uh‐huh.
‐All right?

02:33.599 --> 02:34.810
‐Good girl.
‐Okay.

02:35.812 --> 02:37.690
‐Now go find Alma.
‐Okay.

02:39.778 --> 02:42.324
Wait, where are you going?

02:44.078 --> 02:45.121
Shit.

02:46.415 --> 02:47.376
Oh, that's all right.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.171
I'm sure
he'll turn up somewhere.

02:54.265 --> 02:55.768
Would you like some lemonade?

02:55.852 --> 02:58.231
Thank you, no.
We'll just be a minute.

02:59.066 --> 03:00.068
I'm embarrassed to say that

03:00.068 --> 03:02.030
this has happened before
with Guardian Pogue.

03:02.114 --> 03:03.868
He's been written up twice
in the last month.

03:03.993 --> 03:04.911
Really?

03:04.995 --> 03:06.790
Passed out
in someone's stable once.

03:08.334 --> 03:09.629
We haven't seen him.

03:10.380 --> 03:11.508
‐

03:21.319 --> 03:22.487
Drink this, dear.

03:22.864 --> 03:24.199
‐Is he okay?
‐He's fine.

03:25.076 --> 03:26.872
‐
‐It helps him with his pain.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.921
Could we speak
with your Marthas?

03:32.132 --> 03:34.094
They're in
the middle of bottling cider.

03:34.178 --> 03:35.640
I could go and get them.

03:36.057 --> 03:37.476
They can finish their work.

03:37.602 --> 03:39.689
‐
‐We'll come back.

03:39.981 --> 03:41.067
Of course.

03:41.652 --> 03:42.820
Blessed day.

03:43.279 --> 03:45.660
Blessed day, ma'am.
I'll show myself out.

04:18.642 --> 04:20.521
‐How did I do?
‐

04:22.650 --> 04:23.861
Great.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.533
You did great.

04:29.664 --> 04:30.750
I can wash that for you.

04:33.714 --> 04:34.924
What does it mean...

04:36.052 --> 04:37.304
that they came here?

04:40.519 --> 04:41.897
It means I have to leave.

04:48.911 --> 04:51.082
We always knew
we'd have to leave sometime.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.629
The plan's the same.
Mayday will help us.

04:53.670 --> 04:55.633
They'll get us to a cell
on the western border.

04:55.716 --> 04:58.096
No, thanks. I want out
of this fucking place.

04:58.179 --> 05:00.058
I hear the Republic of Texas
is letting people in.

05:00.141 --> 05:02.145
You cannot go all that way
on a rumor.

05:02.229 --> 05:03.690
Are we any safer with Mayday?

05:03.816 --> 05:05.903
‐They've gotten us this far.
‐Exactly.

05:07.114 --> 05:08.366
I don't want to fight.

05:11.790 --> 05:13.502
None of us wanted to, at first.

05:18.846 --> 05:20.014
June.

05:21.267 --> 05:22.562
Did you hear from Mayday?

05:22.645 --> 05:24.398
The contact
will only talk to you.

05:25.066 --> 05:25.943
Let's go.

05:27.237 --> 05:28.574
Well, why can't they
come here?

05:29.074 --> 05:31.078
Well, you can leave.
She can't.

05:33.457 --> 05:34.627
June.

05:36.590 --> 05:37.884
Okay.

05:39.136 --> 05:40.931
‐Okay.
‐Be careful.

05:48.572 --> 05:50.200
Some of you know my wife.

05:52.162 --> 05:56.420
She's a beautiful person,
capable of great things.

05:56.504 --> 05:57.506
Hey, it's good to see you.

06:04.353 --> 06:07.777
It took some very brave people
to make Angels' Flight happen.

06:08.110 --> 06:09.488
June was one of them.

06:10.156 --> 06:11.785
Would you like to meet another?

06:15.291 --> 06:18.172
Rita Blue,
she was a Martha, and...

06:18.256 --> 06:20.719
‐And she was on that plane.
‐

06:20.803 --> 06:21.972
Come on up.

06:31.115 --> 06:32.535
Thank you for coming.

06:33.119 --> 06:35.456
‐You were great.
‐When I first met June,

06:35.749 --> 06:38.588
I didn't think that she could do
something like this...

06:40.216 --> 06:41.970
Save all of these children...

06:43.431 --> 06:44.559
Save me.

06:46.312 --> 06:47.857
Angels' Flight
is because of her.

06:49.819 --> 06:51.071
She got us out.

06:52.157 --> 06:53.827
And she stayed behind

06:54.369 --> 06:57.877
to keep fighting, even knowing
what that could mean.

07:02.343 --> 07:05.726
Gilead has a way of bringing out
the worst in people.

07:09.191 --> 07:11.278
But in June
it brought out the best.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.203
And...
And...

07:17.165 --> 07:18.668
I'm sorry, uh...

07:19.294 --> 07:20.379
You're doing great,
you're doing great.

07:20.463 --> 07:24.012
Look, as far as we know,
June is still alive.

07:24.096 --> 07:26.559
And that hope
is what keeps us going,

07:26.643 --> 07:28.145
and what keeps
the mission going.

07:28.563 --> 07:30.734
‐So thank you.
‐Thank you, yes!

07:30.818 --> 07:32.028
‐

07:33.239 --> 07:35.284
You did great. You did great.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.963
This is the, uh, point
where I'm supposed to

07:41.046 --> 07:42.675
subtly shift
the subject to money.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.179
‐
‐Hi. You did so great.

07:45.263 --> 07:46.558
‐

07:46.641 --> 07:47.935
‐...why we're here, right?
‐Yeah.

07:48.477 --> 07:49.354
Okay.

07:49.396 --> 07:51.066
And some of our ace fundraisers,
they're gonna be

07:51.108 --> 07:52.318
‐coming around...
‐

07:52.360 --> 07:53.655
Come on up, guys, and...

07:53.697 --> 07:55.032
‐Hi.
‐Hello.

07:55.032 --> 07:56.410
And what you give today
helps the staff

07:56.493 --> 07:57.872
and the volunteers...

07:57.997 --> 07:59.709
Volunteers, raise your hand!

07:59.792 --> 08:02.130
Yeah, these fine folks,

08:02.255 --> 08:04.510
it helps them continue
what June started,

08:04.510 --> 08:06.471
and that's reuniting families,

08:06.723 --> 08:08.309
‐it's making homes, and...
‐Thank you.

08:08.392 --> 08:09.269
Thank you.

08:09.352 --> 08:11.315
And that means
clothes and books.

08:11.481 --> 08:13.110
You can help these kids
start their new lives

08:13.194 --> 08:14.362
outside of Gilead.

08:15.908 --> 08:17.828
‐

08:22.212 --> 08:23.673
‐Hey.
‐Hi.

08:23.798 --> 08:24.926
You did great.

08:26.011 --> 08:27.430
I don't know.

08:28.349 --> 08:29.476
Luke's so good at this.

08:29.769 --> 08:32.566
Oh, yeah, he...
He surprised me.

08:33.526 --> 08:37.408
Um, but thank you...
for speaking.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.498
Well, Luke asked me,
so I couldn't say no.

08:40.791 --> 08:41.960
Sure you could.

08:43.170 --> 08:45.216
"Free" means
you're free to say no.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.387
Well, being here is a gift.

08:48.723 --> 08:50.686
I thank God for it every day.

08:50.811 --> 08:51.896
And for June.

08:52.565 --> 08:56.154
Well, June's still there
and raisin' hell.

08:58.743 --> 09:00.371
I keep her in my prayers.

09:06.300 --> 09:07.678
Pray for Gilead.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.032
Get back.

09:26.841 --> 09:28.302
Pickup for Commander Keyes.

09:28.511 --> 09:30.139
‐All right.
‐

09:51.766 --> 09:52.810
Stay here.

09:54.187 --> 09:55.147
Blessed day.

09:55.231 --> 09:56.567
Blessed day to you.

09:57.736 --> 09:58.947
‐
‐Commander Keyes sent me.

09:59.030 --> 10:00.366
He's got a shipment to pick up.

10:03.372 --> 10:04.834
I don't know about anything,

10:04.917 --> 10:06.504
‐but let me check.
‐Okay.

10:07.046 --> 10:08.340
‐Let's wait inside.
‐

10:08.340 --> 10:09.802
‐How are you doing?
‐Blessed day.

10:09.885 --> 10:11.681
Commander. It's been a while.

10:44.037 --> 10:45.289
Follow me.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.880
<i>Places like this have</i>
always been about fantasies.

11:11.509 --> 11:14.389
<i>They were built so men</i>
could act like country lords.

11:15.182 --> 11:17.186
<i>Pretend you're rich</i>
for a weekend.

11:18.857 --> 11:21.236
<i>Now they're for fantasies</i>
of a different kind.

11:25.787 --> 11:27.624
I mean,
you have short, simple...

12:26.826 --> 12:28.370
I thought you'd be taller.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.715
The Handmaid that killed
Commander Winslow.

12:37.054 --> 12:38.390
Where'd you get the knife?

12:40.352 --> 12:41.772
It was a pen.

12:45.362 --> 12:46.532
You've been busy.

12:47.659 --> 12:49.705
First, Winslow
and then your Air Canada thing.

12:51.291 --> 12:52.669
What have you heard?

12:53.462 --> 12:55.508
They're keeping a lid on it,
officially.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.679
But word's gotten out.

12:59.182 --> 13:00.309
People are doing stuff.

13:00.392 --> 13:02.564
Slashing tires,
cutting power lines.

13:07.991 --> 13:09.661
Someone blew up a checkpoint.

13:13.085 --> 13:16.592
All of those kids... free.

13:19.932 --> 13:21.392
I can't believe you did that.

13:21.519 --> 13:22.813
They took my daughter.

13:26.695 --> 13:28.406
Do you have a safe house for us?

13:29.701 --> 13:32.039
Yeah. The Murrows.

13:32.958 --> 13:35.254
It's a yellow farmhouse
about 13 miles west of you

13:35.337 --> 13:37.968
down Highway 44,
in a stand of poplars.

13:38.093 --> 13:39.220
Stick to the woods.

13:39.555 --> 13:41.600
A quilt hanging on the line
means it's safe.

13:45.274 --> 13:46.735
Can you leave tomorrow night?

13:47.319 --> 13:48.906
No. Guardians came
to the house today.

13:48.990 --> 13:50.033
I need to leave tonight.

13:50.367 --> 13:52.413
I can't send the word
until tomorrow.

13:55.294 --> 13:56.254
If they're not expecting you,

13:56.296 --> 13:57.757
you'll get a face
full of buckshot.

13:59.218 --> 14:00.763
How did you know
about Winslow?

14:07.192 --> 14:09.030
I was in Boston before this.

14:11.326 --> 14:13.581
And after he went missing,
they cleaned house.

14:15.292 --> 14:16.879
I was one of the lucky ones.

14:22.181 --> 14:24.895
I saw some military Commanders
on the way in.

14:31.825 --> 14:33.579
Yeah, they're here
for a couple more days.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.877
One last party before Chicago.

14:37.169 --> 14:38.506
Why are they going there?

14:38.881 --> 14:40.718
To lead some new offensive,
I think.

14:42.054 --> 14:43.724
Just fucking sitting ducks.

14:45.435 --> 14:46.689
Mayday should do something.

14:47.272 --> 14:48.526
You really think

14:48.609 --> 14:50.445
that Mayday
would liberate this place?

14:52.784 --> 14:55.205
I fucking gave up on that
a long time ago.

14:55.581 --> 14:58.420
Hey, it isn't an army.

14:59.338 --> 15:00.758
We are Mayday.

15:02.595 --> 15:04.098
They're people just like us.

15:11.070 --> 15:12.281
Did he do that?

15:13.826 --> 15:15.120
Not directly.

15:15.538 --> 15:18.544
It was an appropriate punishment
under Gilead law.

15:19.713 --> 15:20.965
Over there.

15:34.618 --> 15:36.622
Did your husband
ever sexually assault you?

15:39.795 --> 15:40.963
No.

15:41.089 --> 15:42.132
Turn.

15:42.299 --> 15:43.928
Did he ever have
unprotected sex

15:44.011 --> 15:47.560
with anyone besides yourself
or your Handmaids?

15:49.898 --> 15:51.317
‐Yes.
‐Turn.

15:51.652 --> 15:53.656
‐How many partners?
‐I don't know.

15:55.743 --> 15:58.081
‐He frequented a brothel.
‐

15:58.582 --> 16:00.001
We'll want
to check for STDs.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.047
We'll draw some blood
and get a genital swab.

16:04.051 --> 16:06.180
I know this is difficult,
Mrs. Waterford.

16:07.349 --> 16:09.270
‐
‐Over here.

16:15.031 --> 16:17.829
Were there any other instances
of physical abuse?

16:18.747 --> 16:19.958
No.

16:24.509 --> 16:25.720
Yes.

16:27.222 --> 16:28.851
He struck me here.

16:30.563 --> 16:31.899
Another appropriate
punishment?

16:33.652 --> 16:35.113
It's not that simple.

16:35.656 --> 16:38.328
I'm sure. May I?

16:39.163 --> 16:40.666
‐Mm.
‐

16:46.970 --> 16:48.724
Looks like it didn't
leave a permanent mark.

16:53.191 --> 16:55.487
Look, I understand
what you're saying, and...

16:56.573 --> 16:59.453
And I'm trying, but I just
don't feel comfortable

16:59.537 --> 17:00.706
with this approach.

17:00.790 --> 17:01.833
Except that
it is your best chance

17:01.917 --> 17:03.044
to get this charge dismissed.

17:04.296 --> 17:05.131
‐
‐Okay?

17:05.215 --> 17:06.593
Then we can restore
your immunity deal.

17:06.677 --> 17:08.179
and get Nichole
back in your life.

17:08.263 --> 17:09.766
By playing the victim.

17:09.849 --> 17:11.520
By establishing
a pattern of abuse.

17:12.312 --> 17:13.649
‐
‐That will help the judge

17:13.732 --> 17:14.693
see that
you've acted out of fear

17:14.776 --> 17:16.613
‐for your own safety.
‐But it wasn't abuse.

17:19.326 --> 17:21.455
Not exactly.

17:21.915 --> 17:22.959
Okay, I, uh...

17:23.042 --> 17:24.420
I'm gonna step out
and make a few calls.

17:24.504 --> 17:25.923
I'll be back in a bit.

17:27.802 --> 17:29.430
‐

17:33.146 --> 17:34.691
Ms. Mathis just wants you
to consider

17:34.774 --> 17:36.152
what's in your best interest.

17:38.489 --> 17:39.993
Well, you might have
thought about that

17:40.076 --> 17:41.538
when you served the warrant.

17:42.289 --> 17:43.499
You arrested me.

17:44.043 --> 17:46.005
Now you've got
an accused sex offender

17:46.088 --> 17:48.092
as your key witness
against Fred.

17:52.935 --> 17:54.438
None of this is easy.

17:56.025 --> 17:57.069
I know.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.955
He acted out of anger.

18:06.963 --> 18:08.424
He probably regrets it.

18:11.556 --> 18:13.059
I... I don't

18:14.311 --> 18:15.815
understand why

18:16.775 --> 18:18.821
you're giving him
the benefit of the doubt.

18:18.904 --> 18:21.200
After all he's done. Just...

18:26.085 --> 18:28.423
Because I knew him
before Gilead.

18:37.775 --> 18:40.906
Could I see him? Alone?

18:42.577 --> 18:44.998
I'm going to get Fred
to drop the claim.

18:49.883 --> 18:51.343
I'll see what I can do.

18:54.684 --> 18:56.646
Okay. Thank you.

19:05.371 --> 19:07.334
‐

19:21.613 --> 19:22.657
Aw, shit.

19:23.951 --> 19:25.579
The Spencers fell through.

19:26.372 --> 19:28.000
They were for Alyssa.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.548
Said it'd be "too confusing"
for their own kid.

19:31.716 --> 19:33.512
Okay. Well, back to the list.

19:34.471 --> 19:35.850
That's it for family.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.687
We have survivors
from her church.

19:37.770 --> 19:39.566
‐
‐We'll find her a good home.

19:39.816 --> 19:41.360
So many people want to adopt.

19:41.443 --> 19:43.907
Yeah, and they all
need to be vetted.

19:44.157 --> 19:46.036
At least they're here.

19:47.247 --> 19:48.416
Better than there.

19:52.717 --> 19:55.346
Uh, did you ask the Reids
for Asher's SIN form?

19:55.764 --> 19:57.100
Mm. They didn't come in today.

19:57.475 --> 19:58.979
Should I leave them
another message?

20:02.110 --> 20:03.780
‐Hey.
‐How was it?

20:04.114 --> 20:05.325
It was good.

20:06.703 --> 20:07.747
But now I have to stay here

20:07.830 --> 20:08.999
and do all the things
I didn't do

20:09.082 --> 20:10.168
because I was there.

20:10.251 --> 20:11.504
Oh, so no dinner.

20:11.588 --> 20:13.049
‐I'm sorry.
‐It's all right.

20:13.257 --> 20:16.138
I leave for the resupply
to Thunder Bay tomorrow night.

20:16.221 --> 20:17.223
I know.

20:17.307 --> 20:18.644
Can I come over later?

20:20.313 --> 20:22.359
Can you sleep over later?

20:22.860 --> 20:23.946
Yeah.

20:24.697 --> 20:26.325
She looks cute in her
mouthguard too, you know.

20:28.412 --> 20:30.041
‐

20:30.208 --> 20:32.462
It's true! Text me.

20:35.844 --> 20:36.680
Bye!

20:43.025 --> 20:44.904
You should go, have dinner.

20:45.238 --> 20:46.908
Don't waste that outfit on me.

20:49.204 --> 20:51.291
Nah, I'm gonna stay here
and help out

20:51.375 --> 20:52.586
till you're ready to go home.

20:56.051 --> 20:59.851
Okay, um, I'll go
visit the Reids tomorrow.

21:02.982 --> 21:04.736
She's seen you
in your mouthguard?

21:07.449 --> 21:08.952
Go fuck yourself.

21:11.457 --> 21:12.877
Oh, my God.

21:13.169 --> 21:14.964
June, this is a terrible idea.

21:15.549 --> 21:17.385
I can handle it. No one's
asking you to do anything.

21:17.469 --> 21:19.389
No one's asking you.
You could just leave.

21:19.473 --> 21:20.976
We could all just leave.

21:21.393 --> 21:23.022
I won't have a chance
after tomorrow.

21:23.105 --> 21:24.483
Still waiting to hear why.

21:24.567 --> 21:26.529
'Cause I think these women
deserve to be free.

21:27.030 --> 21:27.907
Is that it?

21:28.742 --> 21:30.746
Or do you just want to kill
a bunch of Commanders?

21:31.539 --> 21:32.541
Both.

21:34.044 --> 21:36.006
And help the people in Chicago.

21:38.094 --> 21:39.806
I can't not do this, Alma.

21:42.561 --> 21:44.982
So, you're just gonna
Rambo in there

21:45.108 --> 21:47.655
and shoot the place up?
Get yourself killed or caught?

21:48.030 --> 21:49.951
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

21:50.243 --> 21:53.917
I... I think that we need
a, um, like, a time bomb.

21:55.461 --> 21:56.798
You know?
Do you know how to make one?

21:56.881 --> 21:58.384
‐No.
‐No?

21:58.467 --> 21:59.386
No, I don't.

22:01.181 --> 22:02.560
So, what then?

22:04.020 --> 22:05.607
I don't know yet, okay?

22:19.259 --> 22:21.138
You stopped talking
when I came in.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.352
I don't like that.

22:26.983 --> 22:28.068
Sorry.

22:28.612 --> 22:31.074
We weren't talking about you.
Did you need something?

22:33.120 --> 22:34.665
Those Guardians
are gonna come back.

22:35.834 --> 22:37.337
They'll keep asking questions.

22:38.548 --> 22:40.426
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.769
There's a lot of farms
for them to check.

23:07.272 --> 23:08.942
It's nothing for you
to worry about.

23:09.944 --> 23:11.488
I can worry if I want to.

23:22.803 --> 23:25.224
So, we're gonna leave
tomorrow night.

23:31.779 --> 23:33.073
Take me with you.

23:33.783 --> 23:35.662
It's not safe
where we're going.

23:35.871 --> 23:37.958
It's not safe anywhere!

23:39.419 --> 23:43.595
I know that you think
you can't trust me,

23:45.974 --> 23:47.352
but you can.

23:50.441 --> 23:52.236
Don't leave me
here alone.

23:55.451 --> 23:56.746
Please.

23:58.958 --> 24:00.336
Please.

24:08.770 --> 24:09.730
All right.

24:19.290 --> 24:20.418
Okay.

24:27.558 --> 24:29.562
We're gonna have to do something
about the Commander.

24:51.229 --> 24:52.482
Have...

24:54.277 --> 24:56.114
Have you been poisoning him?

25:00.247 --> 25:02.001
You learn things on a farm.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.622
Can you teach me
how to make more?

25:30.349 --> 25:31.811
We're going to need a lot.

25:33.188 --> 25:35.527
In September,
there's fresh berries.

25:35.569 --> 25:36.862
They're sweet.

25:37.238 --> 25:38.783
You can bake them
into a cobbler.

25:39.702 --> 25:41.246
When did you
start doing this?

25:42.290 --> 25:43.543
Not soon enough.

25:44.127 --> 25:47.509
I only give him a little,
to keep him from being a bother.

25:48.218 --> 25:49.513
My Martha showed me how.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.103
He's not a good man.

25:57.821 --> 25:59.742
Maybe there are no good men
in Gilead.

26:05.461 --> 26:07.674
I think
there are good men everywhere.

26:09.385 --> 26:10.639
Even here.

26:11.222 --> 26:13.018
It's just complicated, you know?

26:16.817 --> 26:19.113
Gilead makes it really hard
to be good.

26:57.273 --> 26:59.778
I hear
you're still not sleeping well.

27:02.617 --> 27:03.828
You asked?

27:07.042 --> 27:08.336
You're still my wife.

27:15.142 --> 27:18.231
Reminds me
of those airport chapels.

27:21.196 --> 27:22.699
Do you remember the one
in Dallas?

27:22.741 --> 27:24.076
Like on the book tour?

27:25.037 --> 27:28.418
An island of grace
in all that chaos.

27:28.460 --> 27:30.339
A very small island.

27:33.554 --> 27:36.142
That's how they think of God
in this place.

27:37.353 --> 27:39.106
They've made Him small.

27:41.194 --> 27:43.574
My attorney told me
what to expect

27:43.616 --> 27:45.912
at the motion‐to‐dismiss
hearing.

27:52.466 --> 27:54.428
It's just a legal strategy.

27:57.184 --> 28:02.571
You're willing to expose
every... detail of our lives,

28:02.612 --> 28:06.369
our faith,
to complete strangers.

28:06.411 --> 28:08.248
No, I don't want to.

28:11.922 --> 28:13.968
It doesn't have to be like this.

28:20.773 --> 28:22.986
Oh, you've gotten rusty.

28:24.238 --> 28:27.202
You used to be so good at
getting me to do what you want.

28:29.332 --> 28:31.587
But my eyes are open now.

28:34.258 --> 28:37.641
Fred, please.
I just want my daughter back.

28:41.690 --> 28:46.032
Nichole... is not your daughter.

28:46.449 --> 28:48.996
Any more than she is mine.

28:50.040 --> 28:53.673
And if you think
I'm gonna let you have her

28:53.714 --> 28:57.137
and walk free,
go start some new life,

28:59.810 --> 29:01.479
you are delusional.

29:05.947 --> 29:09.453
You know, I thought that
once you were out of Gilead,

29:09.913 --> 29:11.457
once you were
out of that uniform,

29:11.499 --> 29:13.587
that you would come back
to yourself.

29:14.171 --> 29:16.593
I am as you made me.

29:17.679 --> 29:19.223
As you made us.

29:19.265 --> 29:21.394
As I have made us?

29:22.522 --> 29:26.989
Fred, you never once
stood up for me. Not once!

29:27.489 --> 29:29.786
Not once you got
a taste of power!

29:31.832 --> 29:33.794
I thought that was my fault!

29:33.836 --> 29:36.925
I thought that I deserved
everything that you did to me!

29:39.973 --> 29:41.350
You know, I...

29:42.729 --> 29:45.150
I think I gave you
too much freedom.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.376
So you're right.

29:55.212 --> 29:57.550
It doesn't have to be like this.

30:05.315 --> 30:06.527
Guard.

30:30.700 --> 30:32.620
I'm sorry.
I've got it somewhere.

30:33.204 --> 30:35.041
‐Hands full, you know.
‐

30:37.254 --> 30:38.381
I do know.

30:40.135 --> 30:41.597
Instant parenthood's
not somethin'

30:41.638 --> 30:43.182
you can really prepare for.

30:59.298 --> 31:01.970
You remember me, Asher? Moira?

31:02.722 --> 31:04.016
Yeah.

31:04.768 --> 31:07.732
‐How are you, buddy?
‐Hungry.

31:08.232 --> 31:10.696
Well, I made
three different lunches,

31:10.738 --> 31:12.700
and he wouldn't eat any of it.

31:12.742 --> 31:14.579
Chicken fingers.
Buttered noodles. Pizza.

31:14.621 --> 31:15.455
Three?

31:16.040 --> 31:17.250
What kid
doesn't like pizza?

31:17.250 --> 31:18.127
Mmm.

31:18.921 --> 31:20.465
Mmm.

31:24.599 --> 31:26.895
Mm. Your aunt's a good cook.

31:37.917 --> 31:39.294
It's different here, huh?

31:40.589 --> 31:41.675
I hate it.

31:42.552 --> 31:43.887
He keeps saying that.

31:44.304 --> 31:47.185
I miss my Martha. And my room.

31:47.895 --> 31:50.358
‐And my mom and dad.
‐Yeah.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.947
Those people are not
your mom and dad, sweetie.

31:53.657 --> 31:56.287
Please tell him.
He won't listen to me.

31:56.328 --> 31:58.124
It's better
if you don't correct him.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.045
He needs to feel
what he's feeling.

32:07.267 --> 32:08.771
It's okay if you miss them.

32:10.608 --> 32:12.194
Am I gonna see them again?

32:14.114 --> 32:15.283
No.

32:17.370 --> 32:18.916
And I'm sorry.

32:20.001 --> 32:21.922
It is okay
if you are sad about that‐‐

32:21.963 --> 32:23.424
I wanna go home.

32:23.466 --> 32:24.761
No, get back here!

32:24.803 --> 32:26.932
Get back here
and apologize right now!

32:28.142 --> 32:29.478
It's all right.

32:31.566 --> 32:34.071
It's natural for Asher
to be angry.

32:34.113 --> 32:35.741
His name is James.

32:36.701 --> 32:38.037
Same as my brother.

32:39.707 --> 32:41.377
His actual father.

32:42.672 --> 32:43.882
Excuse me.

32:51.313 --> 32:52.692
I got the form.

32:53.944 --> 32:55.071
What happened?

32:55.113 --> 32:57.702
The kid's fucked up.
He misses Gilead.

32:57.910 --> 33:00.123
Like you said, better that
they're here than there.

33:00.165 --> 33:01.417
Eventually.

33:01.458 --> 33:03.505
I mean, right now
it sucks for a lot of them.

33:03.714 --> 33:05.049
The ones that got ripped

33:05.091 --> 33:06.636
from the only families
they remember.

33:06.678 --> 33:08.181
I guess June didn't think
that part through.

33:08.222 --> 33:09.433
'Cause that's what she does.

33:09.517 --> 33:11.813
Takes the big swing,
and fuck the consequences.

33:11.897 --> 33:13.441
Look, God knows
I can be a messy bitch,

33:13.525 --> 33:15.278
but that one, she...

33:16.531 --> 33:20.706
I love her, right?
And I miss her,

33:21.498 --> 33:23.127
and I am worried about her.

33:24.881 --> 33:25.883
And?

33:26.217 --> 33:28.221
I love Nichole
but I never wanted to be a mom.

33:29.641 --> 33:31.561
Why do you feel you have to
clean up June's messes?

33:32.145 --> 33:33.314
Fuck if I know.

33:36.655 --> 33:40.161
Making up for when I got out
and she didn't, I guess.

33:43.417 --> 33:45.255
But I'm tired of feeling guilty.

33:49.096 --> 33:52.561
I get it. She gave me her baby
and stayed behind.

33:53.145 --> 33:54.565
Who does that?

33:58.447 --> 33:59.575
Ah!

34:01.913 --> 34:03.416
Are we terrible people?

34:07.675 --> 34:09.011
Maybe.

34:10.221 --> 34:11.516
But I don't think so.

34:13.019 --> 34:14.814
I just hope she's okay.

34:20.743 --> 34:24.041
June, are you sure you don't
want someone to come with you?

34:24.124 --> 34:26.378
That... That place
sounds kinda scary.

34:28.967 --> 34:30.219
I'll be all right.

34:30.721 --> 34:32.683
I need you to stay here
and take care of everyone, okay?

34:32.767 --> 34:34.186
‐Get them ready for tonight.
‐Okay.

34:34.227 --> 34:36.065
Make sure she has good shoes.

34:36.148 --> 34:37.275
Okay? It's a long walk.

34:37.359 --> 34:38.444
I will.

34:41.534 --> 34:43.245
Red Leader standing by.

34:44.247 --> 34:46.628
Thank you.
I'll be back soon, I promise.

34:47.170 --> 34:48.632
Get them ready for tonight.

34:58.192 --> 34:59.319
Asher?

35:00.321 --> 35:03.327
This is Rita. She's a friend.

35:05.498 --> 35:07.001
Blessed evening.

35:09.757 --> 35:11.051
Blessed evening.

35:12.178 --> 35:13.640
You were on the plane.

35:14.266 --> 35:15.476
I was.

35:16.061 --> 35:17.982
That was a really scary night,
wasn't it?

35:20.153 --> 35:21.656
I thought so too.

35:22.240 --> 35:25.121
Asher, so Rita's gonna
stay the night and cook dinner

35:25.204 --> 35:27.877
while your Aunt Jean
catches up on a few things.

35:27.918 --> 35:29.589
Some of my favorite dishes.

35:30.549 --> 35:31.843
From home?

35:33.220 --> 35:35.934
Yes. And I could use some help.

35:42.238 --> 35:44.034
Could you take this
off my hands?

35:48.000 --> 35:49.127
Where's the kitchen?

35:49.211 --> 35:50.463
‐Over there.
‐All right.

35:55.306 --> 35:56.601
Want to grab this?

35:59.231 --> 36:01.528
All right. Thanks.

36:01.611 --> 36:02.988
Are you sure you won't stay?

36:03.740 --> 36:06.955
Yeah. I, um... I've got plans.

36:24.489 --> 36:26.243
You should've texted.

36:26.326 --> 36:28.707
Oh, what, and ruin
my big romantic gesture?

36:30.042 --> 36:32.380
We can have a special dinner
next week when I'm back.

36:32.463 --> 36:35.428
My Lyft is, like...
Hm, 8 minutes away.

36:35.804 --> 36:37.516
Then we have 8 minutes
of Pad Thai.

36:41.481 --> 36:43.235
I want to have dinner
with you tonight.

36:46.659 --> 36:47.870
‐
‐Oona!

36:47.953 --> 36:49.707
‐I'm sorry‐‐
‐But seriously‐‐

36:49.790 --> 36:51.669
Other people's
always taste better!

36:51.753 --> 36:53.506
I got you that 'cause you said
it was your favorite!

36:53.590 --> 36:54.592
I'm sorry!

37:01.480 --> 37:02.566
Hmm.

37:03.568 --> 37:05.446
You know...

37:07.283 --> 37:10.373
you could always come with me.

37:20.811 --> 37:22.815
‐

37:22.940 --> 37:24.192
Listen to the drivers, too,

37:24.234 --> 37:27.616
and grab whatever you can,
car keys, radios, everything.

37:27.741 --> 37:29.787
‐I don't think I can do this.
‐I do.

37:31.123 --> 37:32.835
We're the ones
we've been waiting for.

37:34.337 --> 37:35.841
It's what my mom used to say.

37:35.966 --> 37:38.220
Daisy! What are you doing
back there?

37:38.930 --> 37:39.974
Give it to me.

37:40.809 --> 37:41.978
I, uh...

37:44.357 --> 37:46.821
She was just tryin' to get
something to eat, ma'am.

37:46.904 --> 37:49.451
I told her to wait until dinner
but you know how they get.

37:49.535 --> 37:50.787
Well, make it quick.

37:50.871 --> 37:53.000
Commander Lowe
is looking for you.

37:53.375 --> 37:55.212
Nothing too fattening,
little piggy.

37:56.214 --> 37:58.720
‐Yes, Aunt Wendy.
‐And I'll take some tea.

38:16.004 --> 38:17.131
It's up to you.

38:18.802 --> 38:20.639
I can just dump this out
if you want.

38:29.447 --> 38:31.953
Better to die on your feet
than to live on your knees.

38:32.663 --> 38:33.665
Right?

38:34.750 --> 38:35.961
Yeah.

38:45.146 --> 38:47.651
Sure you don't want to
stick around for the fireworks?

39:11.239 --> 39:12.826
Where's Dawn?

39:13.828 --> 39:15.707
Look, I don't know
what the legal requirements are,

39:15.749 --> 39:17.251
but I need to separate
my interests from Fred.

39:17.335 --> 39:19.422
‐I am done with him.
‐We can talk about that later.

39:19.506 --> 39:20.634
No, we can talk about it
right now.

39:20.717 --> 39:23.305
You're pregnant, Serena.

39:25.810 --> 39:27.856
The results from your blood test
came back.

39:31.948 --> 39:33.283
Congratulations.
