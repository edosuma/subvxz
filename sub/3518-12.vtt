01:32.429 --> 01:35.266
With just one week to go
before the Iowa caucuses,

01:35.348 --> 01:40.395
the latest Gallup poll has Dunbar
ahead by six points, 45 to 39,

01:40.479 --> 01:43.232
with 16 percent still undecided.

01:43.315 --> 01:46.693
That's a lot of undecideds
so close to election day.

01:46.777 --> 01:49.905
Dunbar has incredibly high
favorability numbers here,

01:49.989 --> 01:53.826
much higher than President Underwood's,
but I have spoken with many Iowans

01:53.909 --> 01:56.162
who have doubts
about her lack of experience

01:56.245 --> 01:59.456
and whether she'll be able
to stand up to a Republican candidate

01:59.539 --> 02:00.958
with a substantial record.

02:01.041 --> 02:03.836
Even so, the fact that she's
still the frontrunner,

02:03.919 --> 02:06.713
- having never run for office.
- It's extraordinary.

02:06.797 --> 02:08.966
Jackie Sharp's endorsement was a big coup.

02:09.049 --> 02:11.302
It really helped her numbers with women.

02:11.384 --> 02:14.221
[Vaughn] We want you to have a much more
active role during the events.

02:14.305 --> 02:15.931
You'll go first, introduce the president,

02:16.015 --> 02:18.433
stay with him the entire time,
and then participate in the Q and A.

02:18.517 --> 02:21.187
I really shouldn't be answering questions.
Francis is the candidate.

02:21.270 --> 02:24.064
Well, the truth is, your favorables
are double what mine are,

02:24.148 --> 02:27.359
so let's give the people what they want.

02:27.442 --> 02:29.820
- Well, if you think it will help.
- I know it will.

02:29.903 --> 02:31.989
Do you have a speech prepared?
Do you have issue papers?

02:32.072 --> 02:35.034
- Everything is in the conference room.
- Let's get started, then.

02:39.663 --> 02:42.041
Have you had a chance
to go over the list...

02:42.124 --> 02:43.416
of replacements for Remy?

02:43.500 --> 02:46.670
Oh, I can't focus on that right now.
I need to get through Iowa first.

02:46.753 --> 02:48.922
Well, I have a suggestion,
sir, that's not on the list.

02:49.006 --> 02:51.342
- Who?
- Me.

02:53.219 --> 02:55.762
Seth, you're invaluable
as a comm director.

02:55.846 --> 02:59.016
Well, that's just it, sir.
You need a media expert at the helm.

02:59.099 --> 03:00.267
We're in an election cycle.

03:00.351 --> 03:01.977
- Everything's about perception.
- Seth--

03:02.061 --> 03:03.937
I want to integrate the policy
and the press teams.

03:04.021 --> 03:05.939
I want to work with cabinet members
and agency heads

03:06.023 --> 03:08.984
on gearing every public statement
towards our platform.

03:09.068 --> 03:11.195
Mobilize our AmWorks allies in Congress.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.155
A commitment list
for futures legislations,

03:13.239 --> 03:15.199
not just simple endorsements.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.785
This outlines in detail what I would
like to do as your Chief of Staff.

03:19.870 --> 03:22.122
All I ask is that you consider it.

03:22.206 --> 03:24.291
Well, of course I will.
Thank you, Seth.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.418
I appreciate you putting
so much time into this.

03:26.501 --> 03:28.170
Thank you, sir.

03:32.966 --> 03:34.385
Thank you.

03:34.467 --> 03:36.636
Robert. [laughs]

03:36.720 --> 03:38.597
Sorry I'm running late.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.473
We hit some weather
on the way back from Iowa.

03:40.557 --> 03:42.268
I appreciate your coming here in person.

03:42.351 --> 03:46.063
- Especially during the... final rush.
- [laughs]

03:46.146 --> 03:48.148
- Anything for you, Robert.
- Have a seat.

03:48.232 --> 03:49.566
Oh, thank you.

03:49.649 --> 03:52.861
And, you know, it's good.
I get a few hours with the kids.

03:54.196 --> 03:56.531
So how does it feel to be back here?

03:56.615 --> 03:57.908
Oh...

03:59.118 --> 04:01.328
I have to admit, I miss it a little.

04:01.412 --> 04:04.915
Your dissent on Godfrey v. Kent
was brilliant, by the way.

04:07.584 --> 04:10.503
My clerks. They wrote it.

04:10.587 --> 04:12.423
Every word.

04:14.466 --> 04:16.135
So it's time.

04:16.218 --> 04:19.805
Ruth says it is,
but I knew before she said anything.

04:19.887 --> 04:23.267
- When are you going to announce?
- Soon.

04:23.350 --> 04:27.520
But I'd like you... to say yes first.

04:27.604 --> 04:29.940
- To what?
- Replacing me.

04:32.525 --> 04:35.904
This isn't the disease speaking.

04:35.988 --> 04:38.449
I haven't forgotten
you're running for president.

04:38.531 --> 04:44.330
But Underwood...
I'm sure he'd nominate you in a heartbeat.

04:44.413 --> 04:47.374
I am the frontrunner, Robert.
Why would I drop out?

04:47.458 --> 04:50.252
- Because this position's for life.
- Underwood is going to lose.

04:50.336 --> 04:53.046
You think he'll go down easily?

04:53.130 --> 04:57.050
And even if you get the nomination,
the Republicans...

04:57.134 --> 05:00.304
They'll... rip you apart.

05:01.180 --> 05:04.599
I'm the swing vote. My seat is important.

05:04.683 --> 05:07.727
You can make a lasting difference here.

05:08.979 --> 05:10.730
That is exactly what he said.

05:10.814 --> 05:16.611
His motivations were atrocious, yes,
but his logic was sound.

05:17.946 --> 05:21.074
Your mind seems sharp as ever, Robert.

05:21.158 --> 05:22.409
Except...

05:24.036 --> 05:28.957
Except for the fact that I can't
remember your name right now.

05:30.209 --> 05:31.251
Heather.

05:33.212 --> 05:34.713
Heather.

05:37.716 --> 05:41.220
Will you continue
to do the work I've done, Heather?

05:41.303 --> 05:43.096
I can't.

05:43.180 --> 05:46.725
If I'm honest with myself,
it's that I want this too much.

05:46.808 --> 05:48.810
I didn't realize it
before I started running.

05:48.894 --> 05:52.981
It is not that I've changed, Robert,
that ambition has clouded anything.

05:53.065 --> 05:57.110
It is that I was blind to this until now,
what I am meant to be.

05:57.194 --> 06:00.364
And I am meant to be
President of the United States.

06:02.157 --> 06:04.159
[crowd cheering]

06:29.518 --> 06:32.020
Wouldn't you all like
to hear from Claire first?

06:32.104 --> 06:34.398
[crowd cheering]

06:41.821 --> 06:43.574
Thank you!

06:43.656 --> 06:46.076
Francis and I so appreciate
you all coming out here

06:46.159 --> 06:49.246
on such a cold day and
welcoming us with such warmth!

06:49.329 --> 06:51.748
It's so good to be back in Iowa!

06:51.831 --> 06:53.500
[cheering]

06:56.669 --> 06:59.881
And I can feel it,
with your support and enthusiasm,

06:59.965 --> 07:02.842
there is no doubt that we
are gonna take this state!

07:02.926 --> 07:03.927
[cheering]

07:09.141 --> 07:10.350
- Hello.
- Good evening.

07:10.434 --> 07:11.560
Hi.

07:11.643 --> 07:14.396
So pleased to have you
staying with us again, Mr. President.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.440
We always love coming here.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.567
It's our favorite house in all of Iowa.

07:18.650 --> 07:21.153
- If you need anything...
- Thank you very much.

07:21.236 --> 07:23.029
- Good night.
- Have a good evening.

07:33.873 --> 07:36.502
You were wonderful today.

07:36.585 --> 07:38.587
They just adore you.

07:40.046 --> 07:41.632
Good night.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.218
Good night.

08:55.830 --> 08:58.166
Yes, connect me with Tom Yates, please.

08:59.209 --> 09:01.545
No, I'll hold.

09:01.628 --> 09:02.962
Mr. President?

09:03.046 --> 09:05.090
Where's the rest of it?

09:05.173 --> 09:06.841
- Have you read it?
- No, not yet.

09:06.925 --> 09:08.427
Just this first chapter arrived.

09:08.510 --> 09:11.346
Will you please read it first, sir?
And then let's talk.

09:11.430 --> 09:13.306
Are you sick?
You sound hoarse.

09:13.390 --> 09:15.183
Well, no, I'm not sick.

09:15.267 --> 09:16.184
I haven't slept much.

09:16.268 --> 09:18.228
All right, I'll call you tomorrow.

09:21.106 --> 09:22.566
[man] Sir?

09:22.649 --> 09:24.401
Excuse me. Sir?

09:25.736 --> 09:27.529
I forgot why I came in here.

09:27.613 --> 09:29.030
The orange juice.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.411
That'll be two twenty-five.

09:35.828 --> 09:37.205
Yeah.

09:52.304 --> 09:56.141
[Tom] "The Fourth of July
means nothing anymore.

09:57.225 --> 10:02.147
Overcooked hot dogs and fireworks
that always leave you disappointed.

10:02.230 --> 10:04.733
Bite-size American flags made in China,

10:04.816 --> 10:09.446
halfheartedly waved by five-year-olds
who'd rather be playing Minecraft.

10:09.529 --> 10:14.743
But the third of September,
that's a date which matters.

10:14.826 --> 10:17.746
It's the day, three decades past,

10:17.829 --> 10:22.083
that a redneck from Gaffney
married a debutante from Dallas.

10:22.167 --> 10:25.253
And the Earth's axis tilted that day,

10:25.337 --> 10:29.132
though neither they, nor we,
knew it at the time.

10:29.966 --> 10:36.640
Here's a woman who describes her vows as
a suicide flirting with a bridge's edge.

10:36.723 --> 10:40.477
And a man who wears his wedding ring
as a badge of shame,

10:40.560 --> 10:43.146
for the debutante deserved more.

10:43.229 --> 10:47.734
But truly, what more could she desire?

10:47.818 --> 10:51.988
Together, they rule
an empire without heirs.

10:52.071 --> 10:55.492
Legacy is their only child."

11:02.332 --> 11:04.083
- [knock on door]
- Come in.

11:06.877 --> 11:08.630
He sent you a copy, too?

11:10.549 --> 11:14.302
I thought this was
supposed to be about you, not us.

11:14.386 --> 11:16.262
The whole thing was a mistake.

11:16.346 --> 11:18.097
We revealed too much, Francis.

11:18.181 --> 11:19.890
I should've never put you
in that position.

11:19.974 --> 11:21.351
I'll put an end to it.

11:22.853 --> 11:25.689
- Do you think he was right?
- About what?

11:28.400 --> 11:33.988
"A cold fusion of two universal elements,
identical in weight, equal in force.

11:34.072 --> 11:38.117
United they stand.
A union like none other.

11:38.201 --> 11:41.580
The unsplittable atom
of American politics."

11:42.455 --> 11:44.499
Well, he was right about some things.

11:45.834 --> 11:48.919
I should go speak to him
face to face, soften the blow.

11:53.633 --> 11:55.468
[Cynthia] She did an event
in Oelwein yesterday

11:55.552 --> 11:58.012
and our people say you could
barely hear her with all the cheering.

11:58.096 --> 11:59.264
How badly can she hurt us?

11:59.347 --> 12:01.641
They only need a point or two
and he's in the margin of error.

12:01.725 --> 12:02.975
So we need to attack her.

12:03.059 --> 12:06.521
The UN stuff slid right off.
We need something new.

12:09.649 --> 12:11.150
Let's talk to Jackie.

12:20.702 --> 12:22.287
[knock on door]

12:26.458 --> 12:29.085
Thank you for coming.
How was your trip?

12:29.168 --> 12:31.630
Good for me.
A little rough for my mom, though.

12:31.713 --> 12:34.340
She's not used to seeing me
more than two days in a row.

12:34.424 --> 12:36.008
She actually ran out of questions.

12:36.092 --> 12:40.388
I'm jealous. Have a seat.
It's been nonstop here for me.

12:41.556 --> 12:43.391
Full-time job here.

12:43.475 --> 12:46.561
Doing surrogate appearances
for Heather in California.

12:47.896 --> 12:49.815
We could really use you, Remy.

12:49.898 --> 12:53.109
Ah... A recruiting session?

12:53.192 --> 12:54.486
You can't be surprised.

12:54.569 --> 12:56.696
I was hoping you just
wanted to see my face.

13:00.408 --> 13:02.661
We can't offer you
as much as you made at Glendon Hill,

13:02.744 --> 13:05.497
but we can offer you a lot more
than you made at the White House.

13:07.165 --> 13:08.207
I'm not interested.

13:09.876 --> 13:13.129
That was fast. Even for you.

13:13.212 --> 13:16.006
- Where'd you land?
- Nowhere.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.927
I'm out, Jackie. No more politics.

13:19.009 --> 13:20.762
You know you don't mean that.
It's who you are.

13:20.846 --> 13:22.722
That's what I thought, too,
for a long time.

13:22.806 --> 13:25.308
I don't even know if I'll stay in DC.

13:29.228 --> 13:30.730
What are you gonna do?

13:32.106 --> 13:34.985
That's the best part.
I have no idea.

13:44.577 --> 13:46.913
I'll save you the trouble
of trying to convince me.

13:49.499 --> 13:51.250
Claire Underwood.

13:53.085 --> 13:54.921
We need to hit her hard.

13:55.964 --> 13:58.717
You want dirt. I don't have any.

14:00.092 --> 14:01.177
You must.

14:05.015 --> 14:06.850
If I did, I don't know
if I'd shovel it your way.

14:07.976 --> 14:11.229
But I don't.
They never let me in the inner circle.

14:17.652 --> 14:19.529
[Cynthia] She pressed him, but nothing.

14:19.612 --> 14:22.657
I find it hard to believe that we don't
have a single thing we can use.

14:22.741 --> 14:24.534
Our oppo team has looked at every article,

14:24.617 --> 14:26.953
every piece of footage
going back 25 years.

14:27.037 --> 14:30.206
Researched acquaintances,
family, the works.

14:30.289 --> 14:34.210
- If it's out there, we would've found it.
- Wait. There is one thing.

14:34.293 --> 14:35.503
What?

14:39.591 --> 14:41.593
[cell phone rings]

14:51.853 --> 14:53.396
Hello?

14:53.479 --> 14:55.023
[Dunbar] Doug. It's been a while.

14:55.106 --> 14:57.609
- What do you want?
- The journal.

14:57.692 --> 15:00.319
What would it take?

15:00.403 --> 15:02.906
You said you would never
do that to another woman.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.033
- How much?
- You're offering money?

15:05.116 --> 15:06.701
If that's what you want.

15:09.328 --> 15:11.122
Betrayal doesn't come cheap.

15:11.205 --> 15:12.582
Name a figure.

15:19.881 --> 15:21.091
What do you like to read?

15:24.970 --> 15:26.137
Do you read?

15:27.973 --> 15:29.682
Yes, I read.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.107
Oh, thank you, Meechum.

15:42.194 --> 15:44.447
- You hate it.
- I didn't say that.

15:45.323 --> 15:48.118
You wouldn't fly back from Iowa
just to say, "Good job."

15:48.200 --> 15:50.996
Well, look, you've only
turned in 21 pages,

15:51.079 --> 15:53.999
and the book was
supposed to be finished by now.

15:54.082 --> 15:56.918
It took me this long to figure out
what the book is really about.

15:57.002 --> 15:59.963
And what it's about, is the two of you.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.881
We have to start over.

16:01.965 --> 16:04.509
Start over? [chuckles]

16:04.592 --> 16:07.512
The book was supposed to be
about America Works.

16:07.595 --> 16:10.222
Now, you said you wanted
to try a different approach.

16:10.306 --> 16:13.184
I was skeptical, but then
I went along with it and now,

16:13.267 --> 16:17.271
you've handed over to me
the beginning of a book...

16:17.355 --> 16:18.397
about my marriage?

16:18.481 --> 16:21.109
Well, do you want it fast,
or do you want it right?

16:21.192 --> 16:23.361
I told you I've never written anything
in less than a year.

16:23.444 --> 16:26.364
Yeah, and in a month's time, you're gonna
say you've come up with some new idea.

16:26.447 --> 16:28.950
No, this is it.
You and Claire. The marriage.

16:29.034 --> 16:32.328
That's the key
that unlocks everything else.

16:32.411 --> 16:35.331
If I had wanted an exposé
about my personal life,

16:35.414 --> 16:38.710
I would've hired a staff writer
from Us Weekly.

16:43.882 --> 16:48.594
Well... hold on a minute.
This is not tabloid bullshit.

16:48.678 --> 16:51.347
You said, in this room,
you wanted an original voice.

16:51.430 --> 16:53.141
I am giving it to you.

16:53.224 --> 16:54.976
You're not narrow-minded, Mr. President.

16:55.060 --> 16:56.895
I know you can appreciate
what I'm trying to do.

16:56.978 --> 16:58.813
Right, but see,
that's the problem right there.

16:58.897 --> 17:00.815
This is about what you're trying to do.

17:00.899 --> 17:04.152
What your needs and...
what did you call it?

17:04.234 --> 17:05.862
- Your addiction.
- That's not true.

17:05.944 --> 17:09.741
No, it is true. I hired you to do a job,
which was to get me votes.

17:09.824 --> 17:11.951
Yesterday, not six months from now.

17:12.035 --> 17:14.746
Now, look, it's no big deal.
It didn't work out.

17:14.829 --> 17:16.497
But I promise you,
you will be paid in full.

17:16.580 --> 17:17.623
Thank you, Tom.

17:17.707 --> 17:20.251
This deserves to be finished,
and it deserves to be read.

17:20.334 --> 17:22.670
Well, I just happen to disagree with you.

17:24.714 --> 17:27.092
Are you afraid of what I wrote?

17:27.175 --> 17:29.301
Afraid? No.

17:29.385 --> 17:31.012
It's just no one's business.

17:32.931 --> 17:35.558
Well, you can't bury it.

17:37.227 --> 17:39.062
I won't allow that.

17:51.741 --> 17:56.328
You're in an intimate relationship
with Kate Baldwin, isn't that correct?

17:56.412 --> 17:59.498
I've never said anything because
I presume that you can separate

17:59.582 --> 18:02.210
your personal life
from our professional arrangement.

18:03.335 --> 18:05.964
But before you start getting
any reckless ideas,

18:06.047 --> 18:09.592
why don't you just remember one thing:
I own this material.

18:09.675 --> 18:14.430
And if you attempt to share it with
anybody, and I mean one single word,

18:14.513 --> 18:17.767
litigation will be
the least of your worries.

18:17.850 --> 18:21.312
I mean, after all,
I don't think either of us

18:21.395 --> 18:26.317
wants any controversy about
the authorship of your first book.

18:28.111 --> 18:29.612
Do we?

18:37.620 --> 18:41.457
Meechum, will you please
escort Mr. Yates out?

18:41.540 --> 18:43.042
And good luck to you, Tom.

18:47.546 --> 18:49.299
Too bad about the book.

18:49.381 --> 18:52.384
- You don't really mean that.
- No, I don't.

19:00.935 --> 19:02.937
[man] Mr. Grayson is on the line, sir.

19:03.021 --> 19:04.772
What was that?

19:04.856 --> 19:07.608
Mr. Grayson is on the line, sir.
He says it's urgent.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.703
He's on line one, sir.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.044
Seth?

19:29.088 --> 19:31.757
All right. I better stay in Washington.

19:31.841 --> 19:33.592
Let Vaughn know.

19:36.346 --> 19:38.056
Get me Claire.

19:38.139 --> 19:40.141
You think the timing is strategic?

19:40.225 --> 19:42.768
Well, he and Dunbar are close.

19:42.852 --> 19:44.687
Do you have any idea
who you're going to nominate?

19:44.770 --> 19:46.564
We'll go through our master list
in the morning,

19:46.647 --> 19:48.274
but this'll take me
off the campaign trail.

19:48.358 --> 19:50.818
I won't be in Iowa for a day or two.
You're okay to cover me?

19:50.902 --> 19:54.030
Yes, of course.
I'll keep waving my pom-poms.

19:54.113 --> 19:56.782
Well, you're a saint to do it without me,
but it's probably best.

19:56.866 --> 19:58.993
They like you even better.

20:00.953 --> 20:02.538
Did you speak with Tom?

20:02.621 --> 20:06.042
I did. He didn't take it well,
but I made it very clear.

20:07.459 --> 20:10.421
I read it again. The chapter.

20:10.504 --> 20:12.506
Let it go. We're done with him.

20:14.133 --> 20:15.385
Claire?

20:17.136 --> 20:19.430
Sorry. Uh, the last event went quite long.

20:19.513 --> 20:21.349
I'm fading.

20:21.432 --> 20:23.268
Well, you get some sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow.

20:23.351 --> 20:25.895
Okay. Good night, Francis.

20:25.978 --> 20:27.855
Good night.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.369
Oh. This is a nice surprise.

20:41.452 --> 20:43.288
Now a bad time?

20:43.371 --> 20:45.748
Not at all.
How did you get in the building?

20:45.831 --> 20:47.959
- Nobody called me.
- The receptionist.

20:48.042 --> 20:51.587
- Scorpio is her favorite book.
- [laughs] Of course, it is.

20:51.670 --> 20:53.256
What are you working on?

20:53.339 --> 20:55.967
Covert operation in the Jordan Valley.

20:56.050 --> 21:00.179
Your boy Underwood has refused to confirm
or deny, but take a look at that.

21:03.433 --> 21:06.811
That's a letter
to the family of Justin Nix.

21:06.894 --> 21:09.814
Navy SEAL who died the same day
as the covert operation.

21:09.897 --> 21:11.774
Signed by the president.

21:11.857 --> 21:13.651
Says it was a training exercise.

21:13.734 --> 21:16.195
I just got off the phone
with a source in the DOD

21:16.279 --> 21:18.990
and they said there were no
SEAL training exercises that day.

21:19.073 --> 21:23.077
His death is the only military KIA
reported on October eighteenth.

21:24.745 --> 21:27.123
Am I shattering your illusions
about the guy?

21:28.166 --> 21:29.750
He fired me.

21:29.834 --> 21:31.877
What? Why?

21:33.504 --> 21:35.465
I didn't want to e-mail it to you.

21:35.547 --> 21:38.759
- This is it?
- The first chapter.

21:40.428 --> 21:44.598
Justice Jacobs served our nation
with duty and distinction.

21:44.682 --> 21:46.434
And when the Court was strongly divided,

21:46.517 --> 21:49.103
as it was many times
during his 23 years on the bench,

21:49.187 --> 21:54.066
it was his swing vote that created legal
precedents that will last for centuries.

21:54.150 --> 21:57.820
Now, it will not be an easy seat to fill,
but fill it I must.

21:58.612 --> 22:00.365
[Seth] Sir.

22:00.448 --> 22:02.074
Dunbar's people just reached out to me.

22:02.158 --> 22:04.785
She's back in Washington
and she wants to meet with you.

22:04.869 --> 22:05.995
What for?

22:06.078 --> 22:09.790
- She wants to talk about the nomination.
- She wants to propose someone.

22:09.874 --> 22:12.460
Yes. Herself.

22:14.712 --> 22:17.507
Find a time.
And find somewhere discreet.

22:17.589 --> 22:19.591
I don't want anyone on staff seeing her.

22:39.778 --> 22:41.739
Good morning. I'm Claire Underwood.

22:41.822 --> 22:45.826
Uh, I just changed her diaper.
I haven't had a chance to wash my hands.

22:45.910 --> 22:49.539
Oh. [laughs]
What is her name? She's beautiful.

22:49.621 --> 22:52.375
- Kayla.
- Kayla. And what's your name?

22:52.458 --> 22:53.792
- Suzie.
- Hi, Suzie.

22:53.876 --> 22:56.670
Well, I just wanted to thank you
so much for your support.

22:56.754 --> 22:58.714
It means so much to my husband and me.

22:58.797 --> 23:03.302
- I don't support him.
- I saw the signs out front.

23:04.303 --> 23:07.265
Those are my husband's.
I support Heather Dunbar.

23:07.348 --> 23:09.850
When we vetted the house,
the husband was here.

23:11.185 --> 23:13.896
Um, would you ever consider
changing your mind?

23:15.106 --> 23:16.399
I'm sorry, Mrs. Underwood,

23:16.482 --> 23:19.402
I don't really want to be
on TV or in the papers.

23:19.485 --> 23:20.778
Oh. My apologies about that.

23:20.861 --> 23:22.488
Would you mind if I just came inside?

23:22.572 --> 23:23.781
No cameras, just me?

23:25.824 --> 23:27.243
I guess so.

23:27.326 --> 23:29.370
We need to do a sweep
of the house first, ma'am.

23:29.454 --> 23:31.038
No. And they stay out here.

23:50.141 --> 23:51.641
Hello, Heather.

23:52.977 --> 23:54.853
How's Robert?

23:54.937 --> 23:56.688
He's sad.

23:56.772 --> 23:59.733
But at least he's making his exit
with grace.

23:59.817 --> 24:03.237
Those were some very nice things you said
about him during your press conference.

24:03.321 --> 24:06.532
Well, what was it you said to me...

24:06.616 --> 24:09.827
about, uh, making things palatable?

24:09.910 --> 24:12.121
- The obscene.
- Ah, yes. The obscene.

24:12.204 --> 24:17.667
Well, it is obscene,
a mind like his losing its sharpness.

24:17.751 --> 24:20.921
I didn't expect the Oval,
but this is interesting.

24:21.005 --> 24:25.801
[chuckles] This is where Petrov and I
smoked cigars during the summit.

24:25.884 --> 24:28.429
That's where he put his out on the wall.

24:28.513 --> 24:33.017
So, Seth tells me you want the nomination.

24:33.100 --> 24:35.727
No. I just said that to get in the door.

24:36.812 --> 24:38.648
Robert thought you'd say
yes in a heartbeat

24:38.730 --> 24:41.233
if it meant me dropping out of the race.

24:41.317 --> 24:44.612
But the decision you have to make
is whether you'll drop out or not.

24:44.694 --> 24:47.072
[laughs] And why would I do that?

24:47.156 --> 24:51.910
I know Claire lied about the abortion,
and I have the journal to prove it.

24:51.994 --> 24:56.040
I'm giving you an opportunity
to bow out gracefully, just like Robert.

24:56.123 --> 24:58.250
But you have to do it before the caucus.

24:58.334 --> 25:00.586
I'll give you three days.

25:01.587 --> 25:04.923
I have no idea what you're talking about.

25:06.050 --> 25:07.759
The one you asked Doug to destroy.

25:08.844 --> 25:11.430
I wouldn't be so certain that he did it.

25:13.015 --> 25:14.392
So...

25:16.477 --> 25:18.604
you're finally one of us.

25:18.688 --> 25:20.439
One of who?

25:20.523 --> 25:25.110
The men. In their smoky back rooms.

25:27.697 --> 25:30.908
And even if there was a journal...

25:30.991 --> 25:33.994
you don't have it in you.

25:34.078 --> 25:36.788
Make whatever assumption you want.

25:40.668 --> 25:43.879
Well, Robert was right.
I would offer you the nomination.

25:43.962 --> 25:46.424
You should take the advice of a smart man.

25:49.552 --> 25:51.845
Three days, Mr. President.

25:51.929 --> 25:53.431
Think about Claire.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.058
Show me out, please.

25:58.686 --> 26:01.647
She can go after me all she wants,
but she goes after Claire,

26:01.731 --> 26:04.024
I'll slit her fucking throat
in broad daylight.

26:05.150 --> 26:09.071
[Suzie] Like when he pardoned Walker,
and that other guy, the rich one.

26:09.154 --> 26:10.864
- Raymond Tusk.
- Yeah, him.

26:10.948 --> 26:13.367
I mean, those were bad people,
and he let them off the hook.

26:13.451 --> 26:15.494
And then he says he's not running
and he does.

26:15.578 --> 26:18.788
Well, it's a little more complicated
than the way you're putting it.

26:18.872 --> 26:21.791
There's a lot of variables that go
into making decisions like that, and...

26:21.875 --> 26:26.046
I can tell you I was right beside him
and he was agonizing.

26:26.130 --> 26:27.797
I'm sorry. She's hungry.

26:27.881 --> 26:30.676
I still breastfeed my girl.

26:34.179 --> 26:36.766
- Go outside, please.
- Ma'am?

26:38.808 --> 26:40.269
Just go outside.

26:43.105 --> 26:45.524
- I can go out too, if you like.
- No, it's okay.

26:45.608 --> 26:47.401
As long as you don't mind
seeing some boob.

26:51.405 --> 26:53.282
Does she have any brothers or sisters?

26:53.365 --> 26:55.200
No, this is the only one.

26:55.284 --> 26:58.120
James and I have been trying for a while.

26:58.203 --> 26:59.330
Had some trouble getting pregnant.

26:59.413 --> 27:02.249
- James is your husband?
- Yeah. He goes by Jim.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.710
But I like James better.

27:05.753 --> 27:08.213
Well, he must trust my husband.
He's supporting him.

27:08.297 --> 27:10.758
[laughs] James doesn't know
what that word means.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.594
- Trust?
- Yeah. The whole town knows it.

27:13.678 --> 27:16.263
He runs after anything in a skirt.

27:16.347 --> 27:18.098
Which I don't mind so much, to be honest.

27:18.182 --> 27:20.267
I mean, I've had a fling or two myself.

27:20.351 --> 27:22.478
What I don't like is how he lies about it.

27:22.561 --> 27:27.065
And then, when he asks me if I've been
with someone and I say yes, he flips out.

27:27.149 --> 27:28.776
Like there's some kind of double standard.

27:28.858 --> 27:31.779
I mean, he wants to dog Christy Mulligan
in the back of her brand new Escalade?

27:31.861 --> 27:35.199
Fine. Why shouldn't I be able
to give Kyle Beckenbauer some head

27:35.282 --> 27:38.703
for building Kayla's crib? [laughs]

27:38.786 --> 27:40.078
I'm sorry.

27:40.162 --> 27:43.415
This is what happens
when you don't sleep for three months.

27:43.499 --> 27:45.917
You two fight?
You and your husband?

27:46.001 --> 27:48.379
Every married couple fights.

27:48.462 --> 27:51.089
I mean, really fight.
Like, the cops get called.

27:51.173 --> 27:53.634
Or they would, if he wasn't the president.

27:54.552 --> 27:58.472
'Cause I mean, the sheriff is practically
a family member at this point.

27:58.556 --> 28:00.683
Now we're fighting
about the damn election.

28:00.766 --> 28:03.352
Like those stupid yard signs.

28:03.435 --> 28:05.855
Sometimes, I wish I could just
pull up stakes and leave him.

28:05.937 --> 28:08.273
But I can't. Why not?

28:08.357 --> 28:10.234
Because of this little one.

28:10.317 --> 28:15.364
Last in vitro we did, I said to myself,
if this one doesn't work, I'm outta here.

28:15.447 --> 28:18.784
We had to double mortgage
the house to pay for it.

28:18.868 --> 28:22.329
But it worked.
And... here I am.

28:25.583 --> 28:28.252
If I was like you...
didn't have a kid...

28:30.962 --> 28:32.715
Can I tell you a secret?

28:32.798 --> 28:36.134
No mother will admit this,
but sometimes I fantasize,

28:36.218 --> 28:38.470
like, like this pillow here...

28:38.554 --> 28:40.681
I mean, and when Kayla was in her crib.

28:40.765 --> 28:43.851
Two minutes.
That's all it would take, and I could go.

28:43.934 --> 28:46.395
And I wouldn't be stuck
to a man I want to leave,

28:46.478 --> 28:49.022
rubbing lotion on my nipples,
they're so raw.

28:49.857 --> 28:51.108
I could start over.

28:56.113 --> 28:58.783
Of course, I don't mean it.
I mean, I'd never to do that.

28:58.866 --> 29:00.284
But... you have thoughts.

29:01.702 --> 29:04.079
You know what, Suzie, I think
I've taken up too much of your time.

29:05.706 --> 29:08.208
You know I'm not serious, right?

29:10.669 --> 29:11.712
Of course.

29:11.796 --> 29:14.381
I'm sorry. I'm just...

29:14.465 --> 29:17.593
[voice breaking] I'm so tired.

29:17.676 --> 29:19.887
You're a really good listener.

29:19.970 --> 29:22.389
I wish you were running for president.

29:23.682 --> 29:25.810
Hey, you can tell them I'm
for your husband if you want.

29:25.893 --> 29:27.185
I probably won't even caucus.

29:29.313 --> 29:30.481
Good luck to you, Suzie.

29:36.487 --> 29:38.489
Mrs. Underwood, did she change her mind?

29:38.572 --> 29:39.990
No, she stuck to her guns.

29:40.073 --> 29:42.493
But you can't blame a woman
for having conviction.

29:44.411 --> 29:47.372
- The president just called for you.
- I'll call him back from the car.

29:48.248 --> 29:51.084
[Frank] Listen to me. What I'm about
to say, I don't want you to panic.

29:52.252 --> 29:53.587
[Claire] What is it?

29:55.965 --> 29:59.885
The journal.
Dunbar claims she has it.

30:01.595 --> 30:03.597
- But how?
- I don't know.

30:03.681 --> 30:05.265
It looks like it might have been Doug.

30:05.349 --> 30:08.310
- He was supposed to--
- I know. It's hard for me to believe.

30:08.393 --> 30:10.312
No, Francis. This can't happen.

30:10.395 --> 30:13.231
Meechum is tracking him down now.

30:13.315 --> 30:15.150
Sweetheart, listen to me.

30:15.233 --> 30:16.694
No, the whole thing, it--
The whole thing--

30:16.777 --> 30:19.488
All she did was make the threat.
That doesn't mean she actually has it.

30:19.571 --> 30:21.740
Whatever you have to do.
Just fix it, Francis.

30:21.824 --> 30:23.158
I will, I promise you that.

30:23.241 --> 30:25.410
But in the meantime,
you have to come back here.

30:25.494 --> 30:27.746
I need you to get to the plane.
You have to come back.

30:27.830 --> 30:30.791
I don't want you there,
out on the road, if we get blindsided.

30:30.875 --> 30:34.044
Claire? Claire.

30:38.131 --> 30:39.675
I'll come home.

30:39.758 --> 30:42.803
You go straight to the plane.
We'll say you weren't feeling well.

30:44.013 --> 30:45.430
Okay.

30:45.514 --> 30:50.019
[all] God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

30:50.101 --> 30:52.437
the courage to change the things I can,

30:52.521 --> 30:55.232
and the wisdom to know the difference.

30:55.315 --> 30:58.569
Keep coming back.
It works if you work it.

31:19.673 --> 31:21.383
So?

31:21.466 --> 31:24.469
You honestly believed he'd go for this?

31:26.055 --> 31:27.347
Yeah.

31:27.431 --> 31:30.267
The writing is good. And it's honest.

31:31.936 --> 31:35.105
But what candidate in their right mind
would want something like this out there?

31:35.188 --> 31:39.150
I need you to write about it.
That he's trying to suppress this.

31:39.234 --> 31:41.653
- What you need is sleep.
- Do this for me, Kate.

31:41.737 --> 31:43.739
- I can't. It's a conflict of interest.
- Come on.

31:43.822 --> 31:46.450
The moment we slept together,
we crossed the line.

31:46.533 --> 31:47.952
Fuck the line!

31:48.035 --> 31:50.287
I'm not risking my reputation
because your book is dead.

31:50.370 --> 31:53.206
Oh, no. Not dead.

31:53.290 --> 31:54.833
I'm gonna finish it.

31:54.917 --> 31:56.794
I'll change the names if I have to,
call it fiction.

31:56.877 --> 31:59.046
He's the President of the United States.

31:59.129 --> 32:01.757
- So what?
- He crushes people.

32:01.840 --> 32:05.052
Let this go.
Just start something new.

32:06.887 --> 32:08.430
"Start something new."

32:10.390 --> 32:14.311
Jesus... Christ, you don't get it.

32:14.394 --> 32:16.313
I do it all the time.

32:16.396 --> 32:18.690
My editor passes on a story,
I move on to the next one.

32:18.774 --> 32:21.819
I'm so fucking disappointed
in you right now.

32:21.902 --> 32:23.112
Me?

32:23.194 --> 32:25.948
I'm the one trying to save you
from your own delusions.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.449
That's exactly what he said.

32:27.532 --> 32:29.118
Maybe he's right.

32:36.249 --> 32:39.419
I almost felt something for you.

32:42.172 --> 32:43.674
[door slams]

33:01.650 --> 33:03.068
Come in.

33:09.366 --> 33:10.742
Let me take your coat.

33:17.791 --> 33:19.417
Can I get you anything?
Something to drink?

33:19.501 --> 33:22.004
No. No, I'm good.
Thanks.

33:30.554 --> 33:33.640
I appreciate the home visit,
but I'm not gonna change my mind.

33:33.724 --> 33:35.809
No, no. I didn't think you would.

33:38.145 --> 33:39.646
Something wrong?

33:42.733 --> 33:44.401
I don't know what to do.

33:44.484 --> 33:46.737
I figured...

33:46.820 --> 33:50.281
When I asked you to join the campaign,
I just assumed you would say yes.

33:50.365 --> 33:52.576
That the two of us,
we would be working together.

33:52.659 --> 33:54.036
And...

33:58.832 --> 34:00.542
I... I...

34:00.625 --> 34:02.586
I can't stop thinking about you.

34:04.838 --> 34:06.173
You're married, Jackie.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.344
For the wrong reasons.

34:12.721 --> 34:14.056
I thought you loved each other.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.933
Not like this.

34:18.226 --> 34:20.395
I'm not the person I want to be.

34:20.478 --> 34:24.065
You're who you need to be.
Look at what you've achieved.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.943
But you did it.
You gave it all up.

34:26.025 --> 34:28.277
In a heartbeat.

34:32.949 --> 34:34.201
We're different people.

34:38.205 --> 34:39.915
You should go.

34:42.751 --> 34:44.210
Put this behind you.

35:02.854 --> 35:06.108
I guess it was naive to think
that we could remain close.

35:12.614 --> 35:14.241
So this is it?

35:15.867 --> 35:17.869
Yeah. It is.

35:23.500 --> 35:24.918
Jackie?

35:29.298 --> 35:30.715
Jackie...

36:15.927 --> 36:18.013
She says she has it.

36:18.096 --> 36:19.681
She doesn't.

36:21.432 --> 36:23.268
How do I know there aren't other copies?

36:25.645 --> 36:29.691
- Where do you keep your cigarettes?
- In the bowl up there.

37:22.535 --> 37:25.414
Why didn't you destroy it
when I first asked you to?

37:25.496 --> 37:27.498
I don't know.

37:27.582 --> 37:31.336
Something stopped me.
Maybe I would need it one day.

37:31.420 --> 37:34.631
For you. To prove my loyalty.

37:34.714 --> 37:37.675
You told her.
I'd hardly call that loyalty.

37:37.759 --> 37:41.596
I had to show her I was serious.
The journal was a way to do that.

37:41.679 --> 37:43.974
I never came close
to putting it in her possession.

37:46.476 --> 37:48.312
Anything else I should know?

37:48.395 --> 37:51.106
I'm sober. It's been 87 days.

37:51.189 --> 37:52.941
I meant in regards to Dunbar.

37:53.024 --> 37:56.278
It is related. This is a tight race.

37:57.904 --> 37:59.364
Make me your Chief of Staff.

38:01.866 --> 38:03.368
You promised.

38:03.452 --> 38:05.703
You promised there'd be a place
for me here when I was ready.

38:05.787 --> 38:09.291
That was before you fell off the wagon
and walked in here with that journal.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.667
I've made mistakes.

38:10.750 --> 38:14.921
I've fallen down more than once, and
you've always been there to pick me up.

38:15.005 --> 38:17.757
But you've been falling down
for the past year, too,

38:17.841 --> 38:19.884
and you need someone
to pick you up this time.

38:21.219 --> 38:23.680
It's not Remy. It's not Seth.

38:23.763 --> 38:25.474
It's me, Frank.

38:31.146 --> 38:33.982
And how can I know
I can ever trust you again?

38:36.026 --> 38:38.320
Because I just lit
two million dollars on fire.

38:41.198 --> 38:44.742
We expect higher than usual turnout,
anywhere from 180 to 220.

38:44.826 --> 38:48.121
The higher the turnout, the better.
We're stronger with women and students.

38:48.205 --> 38:50.374
- We've got a GOTV--
- Excuse me, I have to take this.

38:51.582 --> 38:54.085
- Doug?
- I have an update regarding the journal.

38:54.169 --> 38:56.921
- What is it?
- A message from the president.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.394
I have only one thing to say.

39:11.895 --> 39:14.022
Go fuck yourself.

39:18.818 --> 39:21.112
Christ, that felt good.

39:23.114 --> 39:27.369
Start putting together a shortlist
of potential nominees for the court.

39:30.455 --> 39:34.209
- You already...?
- I'm on it, sir.

39:43.343 --> 39:45.220
[exhales deeply]

39:47.889 --> 39:49.099
[Frank] Claire.

39:51.684 --> 39:54.479
Want me to have them make you something
from the downstairs kitchen?

39:54.563 --> 39:57.941
No, I ate on the plane.
Just feeling a little warm.

39:58.024 --> 39:59.443
It'll pass.

40:03.780 --> 40:05.240
What did Doug say?

40:07.700 --> 40:09.869
It's destroyed.

40:09.953 --> 40:12.372
I watched him burn the page myself.

40:12.456 --> 40:14.999
- What about copies?
- He says there aren't any.

40:15.083 --> 40:16.543
And you trust him?

40:16.626 --> 40:20.213
He had ample opportunity
to do us real damage and he didn't.

40:20.297 --> 40:23.258
- But he held onto it for so long--
- I believe him, Claire.

40:23.341 --> 40:25.552
I believe him.

40:27.929 --> 40:30.181
And I'm gonna make him my Chief of Staff.

40:32.016 --> 40:33.560
Are you out of your mind?

40:33.643 --> 40:35.895
We need him, Claire.
We need him now more than ever.

40:35.979 --> 40:38.982
He betrayed us, Francis!
He told Dunbar about me.

40:39.065 --> 40:41.610
To gain her trust, not betray ours.

40:41.692 --> 40:45.238
Look, Doug is the only person
we've ever been able to trust,

40:45.322 --> 40:48.575
and he played this very smart.
He never put us in any real danger.

40:48.658 --> 40:50.910
The journal is gone.
She can't do anything.

40:50.994 --> 40:52.954
Why didn't you ask me
before you brought him back?

40:53.037 --> 40:56.207
- Bec-- We're discussing it now.
- After you hired him!

40:56.291 --> 40:58.251
I know this must have been
harrowing for you,

40:58.335 --> 40:59.919
- but listen, it is ov--
- No. I don't--

41:00.003 --> 41:02.797
I'm starting to question
all of it, Francis.

41:04.132 --> 41:07.885
What any of it is worth.
What... what are we doing this for?

41:07.969 --> 41:10.347
For this house.

41:10.430 --> 41:12.432
For the presidency.

41:14.225 --> 41:16.811
Now, look, if you need to take
a few days off, that's fine.

41:16.894 --> 41:18.980
You do not have to come
with me to Iowa tomorrow.

41:21.983 --> 41:24.569
No. Of course, I'll be there.

41:34.162 --> 41:35.455
[knock on door]

41:35.539 --> 41:39.167
Welcome back, Doug.
Congratulations.

41:39.250 --> 41:41.461
- Thank you.
- I just wanted to get a heads up

41:41.545 --> 41:43.547
on when you'd like to make
the formal announcement.

41:43.630 --> 41:44.755
Let's do it after the caucus.

41:44.839 --> 41:47.217
I don't want to draw any attention
away from the campaign.

41:47.300 --> 41:49.927
You probably shouldn't attend
the press briefing today.

41:50.011 --> 41:51.721
No. I'll take off before then.

41:51.804 --> 41:53.348
Here, you should see this.

41:55.058 --> 41:57.394
This just came out ten minutes ago.

42:00.313 --> 42:01.481
Have you shown the president?

42:01.565 --> 42:04.734
I drafted up some talking points.
I figured you'd want to brief him.

42:04.817 --> 42:05.902
I'll be in my office.

42:07.362 --> 42:08.988
Seth.

42:10.448 --> 42:12.950
The president told me
you asked for the job.

42:14.952 --> 42:17.372
Yeah, I didn't realize
that you were in contention.

42:17.455 --> 42:19.416
I don't want you to resent me.

42:20.250 --> 42:21.543
Hey, I'm a professional.

42:22.835 --> 42:25.880
Let me know if you want any changes made
to the talking points.

42:25.963 --> 42:28.091
I'm sure they're good.

42:28.174 --> 42:29.593
You can share 'em with the president.

42:31.302 --> 42:32.762
You don't want to look 'em over first?

42:32.845 --> 42:35.973
No. I trust your judgment.

42:48.027 --> 42:50.238
I can tell you
that the shortlist is coming along,

42:50.321 --> 42:54.701
and it is my intention to nominate someone
within the next two or three weeks.

42:54.784 --> 42:57.078
It's very important
that we do this quickly,

42:57.161 --> 43:00.248
so that the Senate has time
for their hearings.

43:00.331 --> 43:03.167
And we shouldn't leave that seat
empty too long anyway,

43:03.251 --> 43:04.877
while the Court is still in session.

43:04.961 --> 43:06.588
- Mr. President?
- Sara.

43:06.671 --> 43:09.674
Mr. President, would you comment
on Ms. Baldwin's article

43:09.758 --> 43:11.426
about the Jordan Valley operation?

43:11.509 --> 43:14.429
I think Ms. Baldwin's article is
really nothing more than speculation.

43:14.512 --> 43:16.431
- But the evidence...
- I'm sorry?

43:16.514 --> 43:18.725
But the evidence she presents
is convincing.

43:18.808 --> 43:21.770
Evidence? A letter?

43:21.852 --> 43:25.898
Unfortunately, I have to write letters
like that more often than I would like.

43:25.982 --> 43:28.401
And I don't think it's proof
of anything more than

43:28.485 --> 43:30.820
I reached out to the family of a young man

43:30.903 --> 43:35.533
who sacrificed his life for our country
and for which I am eternally grateful.

43:35.617 --> 43:36.993
Mr. President?

43:37.076 --> 43:39.454
Well, Ms. Baldwin,
it is your article we're discussing.

43:39.537 --> 43:42.624
I suppose I'd get hammered
if I didn't allow you to ask a question.

43:42.707 --> 43:45.460
Thank you, Mr. President.
My question is very straightforward.

43:45.543 --> 43:47.337
You mentioned in the letter
that Lieutenant Nix

43:47.420 --> 43:48.879
died in a training exercise.

43:48.963 --> 43:50.799
You signed this letter with your own hand.

43:50.881 --> 43:53.843
Can you tell us in all honesty
that this is how he died?

43:53.926 --> 43:57.013
I can tell you that this is exactly
what the Pentagon reported to me.

43:57.096 --> 44:00.308
And beyond that, it's not the policy
of this administration

44:00.391 --> 44:03.144
or the Department of Defense
to discuss any specifics

44:03.227 --> 44:04.729
about any Special Forces deaths.

44:04.813 --> 44:05.814
May I ask one more, please?

44:05.896 --> 44:07.982
I believe we're finished
with that subject now.

44:08.065 --> 44:09.150
It's about Iowa.

44:10.234 --> 44:11.569
Yes, all right. Go ahead.

44:11.653 --> 44:13.154
Your wife has been doing a lot of events.

44:13.237 --> 44:15.906
Did she resign her post
at the United Nations because you think

44:15.990 --> 44:18.702
she's more valuable as a campaign
asset than an ambassador?

44:18.785 --> 44:21.871
Claire has been doing a lot of events,
that is true,

44:21.954 --> 44:24.290
as she has in every campaign
that I have ever run.

44:24.374 --> 44:27.918
I'm hoping, I suppose my strategy is that
if the American people

44:28.002 --> 44:31.214
can see that I was smart enough to
marry an extraordinary woman like Claire,

44:31.297 --> 44:34.217
well, they might think I'm smart enough
to be President of the United States.

44:34.300 --> 44:38.179
As for the ambassadorship, that was
entirely her decision, not mine.

44:38.262 --> 44:41.224
She enjoys campaigning,
and I'm looking forward to getting back

44:41.307 --> 44:43.017
to Iowa with her a little later today.

44:43.100 --> 44:45.061
- [clamoring]
- Thank you all very much.

44:49.232 --> 44:50.941
[Green] We know he's
somewhere near Caracas.

44:51.025 --> 44:52.485
[Doug] I need him back.

44:52.569 --> 44:54.278
[Green] The Venezuelans
haven't been cooperating.

44:54.362 --> 44:56.072
We have extradition.

44:56.155 --> 44:57.948
Doesn't mean they'll enforce.

45:00.909 --> 45:02.620
Then get me a precise location.

45:02.704 --> 45:05.039
- Why?
- It doesn't concern you.

45:05.122 --> 45:07.250
It does concern me.
There are a lot of people at the agency

45:07.333 --> 45:10.420
who are embarrassed that he crossed
the border without us knowing.

45:10.503 --> 45:11.920
That's not my problem.

45:12.004 --> 45:15.675
Was it you? Passport lock?

45:15.759 --> 45:19.011
The only other agency
that could've lifted it is Homeland.

45:19.095 --> 45:22.682
- I know you have friends there.
- I have friends everywhere.

45:22.766 --> 45:24.893
I'm not gonna help you
clean up your mess, Doug.

45:24.975 --> 45:27.520
Not if you helped him escape.

45:27.604 --> 45:29.938
This isn't a request.

45:30.022 --> 45:32.400
I'm Chief of Staff to the president now.

45:32.483 --> 45:35.278
- He hasn't announced anyone.
- He will.

45:36.028 --> 45:40.366
And if you want my first official task
to be finding your replacement, so be it.

45:40.450 --> 45:42.993
If not, you tell me where Gavin is.

45:51.085 --> 45:53.630
I watched the press conference
this morning.

45:53.713 --> 45:55.924
I think the Baldwin article
will blow over.

45:56.006 --> 45:58.301
A non-story. No legs.

45:58.384 --> 46:01.304
You said it was my decision to resign.

46:01.387 --> 46:02.680
Well, it was, wasn't it?

46:02.764 --> 46:05.391
I mean, at least that's how
we presented it.

46:09.395 --> 46:12.189
I spoke with a woman yesterday
in Iowa, who...

46:13.441 --> 46:16.402
said she couldn't support us...

46:16.486 --> 46:18.488
because she doesn't trust you.

46:18.571 --> 46:21.282
Well, I'm not the first politician
that some people don't trust.

46:21.365 --> 46:24.034
We've been lying for a long time, Francis.

46:24.118 --> 46:26.120
Of course we have.
Imagine what the voters would think

46:26.203 --> 46:28.164
if we started telling the truth.

46:28.247 --> 46:30.124
Not to them.

46:31.542 --> 46:33.294
To each other.

46:36.004 --> 46:38.549
[sighs deeply]
