00:06.687 --> 00:09.155
<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:09.222 --> 00:11.417
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:11.491 --> 00:14.324
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:14.394 --> 00:16.088
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:21.268 --> 00:25.102
We're short how much? Well,
throw in the red Bentley.

00:25.872 --> 00:28.466
That's right, baby,
out with the old.

00:29.343 --> 00:32.436
"Out with the old"? Is that
the theme of Friday's auction?

00:32.512 --> 00:35.481
Pam, we're celebrating
a life of privilege.

00:35.549 --> 00:37.881
With the magazine's circulation
declining, Mr. Merritt,

00:37.951 --> 00:40.385
some people say this
auction is about money.

00:40.454 --> 00:43.287
No, it's just my way
of sharing

00:43.357 --> 00:46.087
<i>40 years of good times
with the readers.</i>

00:47.494 --> 00:49.985
Jim, we're moving the breakfast
with the Teachers Union to next week.

00:50.063 --> 00:55.626
<i>Putting it all out there, baby.
The good, the bad, and the very bad.</i>

00:57.003 --> 00:59.563
<i>You, too, can own a piece of
George Merritt's good times,</i>

00:59.639 --> 01:01.607
<i>when 40 years of
Men's Privilege memorabilia</i>

01:01.675 --> 01:03.870
<i>goes up for auction
at Bartleby's.</i>

01:05.779 --> 01:08.270
All right, folks.
Let's get back to work.

01:08.348 --> 01:12.614
<i>My years as a Privilege Honey were
some of the happiest of my life.</i>

01:12.686 --> 01:16.850
I worked on the jet, you know.
That's where I met my husband Johnny.

01:17.090 --> 01:20.321
Is that what brought you all the
way from Houston, the memories?

01:20.394 --> 01:22.794
I owe Georgie Merritt so much.

01:22.863 --> 01:25.855
And if buying some of the wonderful
things he's putting up for sale

01:25.932 --> 01:27.991
helps him just
a teeny bit...

01:28.068 --> 01:29.194
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:29.269 --> 01:30.293
That's all right.

01:30.370 --> 01:33.362
Are you Lila Brown,
the January, 1972 Honey?

01:33.974 --> 01:34.963
Yes, I am.

01:35.041 --> 01:37.509
This is...
I can't tell you.

01:37.577 --> 01:42.674
You had the most beautiful
hobbies. Would you sign this?

01:42.749 --> 01:44.512
Sure.

01:44.584 --> 01:47.018
You still got it, sugar.

01:48.221 --> 01:51.657
Lot 82. They actually
let me look through it.

01:51.725 --> 01:56.321
The estimate's eight grand.
Best money you'll ever spend.

01:58.098 --> 02:01.397
And we have $45,000 from
the lovely lady on the left.

02:01.468 --> 02:02.833
$45,000. Do I have
any advance on...

02:02.903 --> 02:03.927
50.

02:04.004 --> 02:07.633
Oh, $50,000 from Helen
on the telephone. $50,000.

02:07.707 --> 02:10.699
We have 50. $55,000
from the lady on the left.

02:10.776 --> 02:12.802
$55,000
60.

02:12.879 --> 02:15.109
$60,000 from Helen
on the telephone.

02:15.182 --> 02:17.980
$65,000 from the lovely lady
on my left. 65...

02:18.051 --> 02:19.075
70.

02:19.152 --> 02:22.121
$70,000 from Helen on the
phone. $75,000 from the lady...

02:22.189 --> 02:23.986
I'm sorry, sir, but the
bidder still has her paddle up.

02:24.057 --> 02:25.752
Helen, any advance?
No? $75,000...

02:25.826 --> 02:26.884
That's not possible, sir.

02:26.960 --> 02:27.949
Do you want to bid?

02:28.028 --> 02:30.019
Going, going, gone!

02:30.096 --> 02:31.290
I'm sorry, sir,
the bidding's over.

02:31.364 --> 02:32.888
Congratulations.

02:34.134 --> 02:36.125
And now we're gonna move
right along... Sir, I'm sorry.

02:36.203 --> 02:38.933
...to Lot Number 83.
Originally shoes...

02:39.005 --> 02:41.667
Sir, I have to hang up now.

02:42.676 --> 02:46.009
Sometimes it seems as if
it was all just yesterday.

02:46.079 --> 02:49.014
How about I take you all
downstairs for some hot chocolate?

02:49.082 --> 02:51.107
Now go, get your brother.

02:52.886 --> 02:55.514
Grandpa's taking us
for hot chocolate!

02:56.223 --> 02:59.681
The Hot Chocolate Express
is leaving the station!

03:06.900 --> 03:11.360
Johnny? What did you forget? Come
see what's become of your Honey.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074

04:03.356 --> 04:04.846
Family found her
when they came back.

04:04.925 --> 04:07.120
Maid on the floor below
reported a pass key missing,

04:07.193 --> 04:08.785
that's how the perp
gained entry.

04:08.862 --> 04:10.523
Took the rings off
Mrs. Parsons's fingers,

04:10.597 --> 04:12.724
but the big-money jewelry's
still in the safe.

04:12.799 --> 04:14.323
Any other
rooms burglarized?

04:14.401 --> 04:16.426
None reported,
but we're canvassing.

04:16.503 --> 04:19.700
A blast from the past.
A Honey suit.

04:20.874 --> 04:22.603
Any idea how this got here?

04:22.676 --> 04:25.907
The Parsons were at a
memorabilia auction this morning.

04:25.979 --> 04:28.072
The items that they bought,
any of them missing?

04:28.148 --> 04:29.911
We're still getting
an inventory.

04:29.983 --> 04:31.245
This is odd.

04:31.885 --> 04:35.685
Just before the murder, somebody
made nearly 20 calls from the room.

04:35.755 --> 04:40.954
All within 15 minutes, all local numbers.
No call was more than a minute long.

04:44.197 --> 04:47.758
Odder still, look at the
exchanges on these numbers here.

04:51.004 --> 04:53.529
I don't recognize
any of these.

04:53.607 --> 04:56.041
The exchange on some
of those numbers

04:56.109 --> 05:00.478
haven't been active since the area
code was split a few years ago.

05:00.547 --> 05:02.014
These calls were around 3:00,

05:02.082 --> 05:05.347
just before we took the kids
out for hot chocolate.

05:05.685 --> 05:08.279
I know Lila wasn't
using the phone.

05:08.855 --> 05:12.154
Your grandkids, where were
they before you went out?

05:12.626 --> 05:16.687
Holly was watching TV and
Kenny was in his parents' room.

05:16.763 --> 05:18.162
Alone?
Yes.

05:19.733 --> 05:20.927
I didn't call anybody.

05:21.001 --> 05:23.196
Kenny, what did I tell
you about lying?

05:23.269 --> 05:26.136
Let's call the numbers.
Ask who called.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.838
Okay, I called them.
Big deal.

05:30.477 --> 05:34.675
You're right, it's a big deal.
So where'd you find the numbers?

05:35.181 --> 05:37.081
In this book my grandma
bought this morning.

05:37.150 --> 05:38.481
What kind of book?

05:38.551 --> 05:41.611
Belonged to that guy
who owns a porno magazine.

05:42.188 --> 05:44.713
I just wanted to hear
what the girls sounded like.

05:44.791 --> 05:48.693
Like, if they're in this guy's
book, they have to be hot.

05:49.529 --> 05:51.258
What did you do
with the book?

05:53.967 --> 05:54.956
Anyone look under here?

05:55.035 --> 05:57.902
No, sir, we haven't gotten
around to this room yet.

05:57.971 --> 06:01.737
"Also included is George Merritt's
very own little black book

06:01.808 --> 06:05.209
"covering the years
1988 to 1991,

06:05.278 --> 06:07.075
"containing the addresses
and phone numbers of

06:07.147 --> 06:09.843
"the famous, the infamous
and the anonymous. "

06:09.916 --> 06:11.406
And now it's gone.

06:11.484 --> 06:13.577
An aging swinger's
little black book.

06:13.653 --> 06:16.349
Somebody must be
desperate for a love life.

06:19.225 --> 06:23.059
My archivist told me it was
either move or have a fire sale.

06:24.297 --> 06:26.629
Well, the catalog said that

06:27.300 --> 06:30.633
the entries in your
address book were annotated.

06:33.073 --> 06:34.631
What kind of notations
did you make?

06:34.708 --> 06:38.576
Little things to help me remember
people, where we met, what we were doing.

06:38.645 --> 06:39.907
A crib sheet.

06:39.979 --> 06:43.779
Yeah, you meet as many people
as I do, you need a little edge.

06:43.850 --> 06:48.787
Oh, here she is. January,
'72. Lila was a lovely girl.

06:49.656 --> 06:52.625
She was a Stinger Honey.
The jet, you know?

06:53.560 --> 06:57.963
Well, maybe someone wishes that they
weren't in your little black book.

06:58.031 --> 07:02.434
Only fun people got in my book, baby.
And fun people don't have regrets.

07:03.369 --> 07:07.863
Eve, they're asking about the
address book. Eve's my archivist.

07:08.174 --> 07:10.608
We were wondering
if you have a copy of it.

07:10.677 --> 07:13.237
In '91, we switched to an
electronic organizer.

07:13.313 --> 07:15.338
I made one copy then.

07:15.415 --> 07:18.111
I had no idea how valuable
that book would be.

07:18.184 --> 07:19.617
The bidding was fierce?

07:19.686 --> 07:23.349
Came down to two bidders, Lila
in the room and one on the phone.

07:23.423 --> 07:24.981
But Lila kept her paddle up.

07:25.058 --> 07:27.253
Whatever Lila wanted,
Lila got.

07:28.361 --> 07:29.692
That girl was implacable.

07:29.763 --> 07:32.254
Maybe not as much
as the runner-up.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.960
The other bidder
was a Timothy Holtzman.

08:03.029 --> 08:04.792
First-time client
of the auction house.

08:04.864 --> 08:08.960
His application listed an address in
Delaware and a corporate credit card account.

08:09.035 --> 08:12.562
Credit card company's sending
us the activity on the card.

08:12.639 --> 08:15.233
Here's what a sore
loser sounds like.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.699
The auction house records
all its phone bids.

08:17.777 --> 08:19.802
<i>I'm sorry, sir, but the bidder
still has her paddle up.</i>

08:19.879 --> 08:21.073
<i>Well,
she can't do that.</i>

08:21.147 --> 08:22.614
<i>Yes, sir, it's allowed.
Do you want...</i>

08:22.682 --> 08:25.173
<i>It's unfair competition.
I want the bidding suspended.</i>

08:25.251 --> 08:27.082
<i>That's not possible, sir.
Do you want to bid?</i>

08:27.153 --> 08:28.620
<i>Okay, now go 80.</i>

08:28.688 --> 08:29.712
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

08:29.789 --> 08:32.815
<i>What? No, no, no. I put in a bid.
You asked me if I wanted to bid.</i>

08:32.892 --> 08:34.291
<i>Sir, I'm sorry.
Sorry?</i>

08:34.360 --> 08:36.885
<i>This is a rigged auction!
I'm suing Bartleby's...</i>

08:36.962 --> 08:38.089
<i>Sir...
... for tortious interference.</i>

08:38.164 --> 08:39.153
<i>I have to hang up now.</i>

08:39.232 --> 08:40.392
<i>...and I'm suing you
for fraud.</i>

08:40.466 --> 08:42.092
<i>I have your name.</i>

08:42.635 --> 08:45.433
"Tortious interference. "
A lawyer?

08:45.505 --> 08:47.405
Worse. A Texas lawyer.

08:47.473 --> 08:51.273
He's not familiar with auctions,
probably not a serious collector.

08:51.344 --> 08:52.902
Maybe fronting for someone.

08:52.979 --> 08:55.470
Last purchase on the
credit card was a month ago.

08:55.548 --> 09:00.485
Ten grand in office supplies in
Brooklyn. And pizza, lots of pizza.

09:00.553 --> 09:04.045
Three to four hundred bucks a
night, every night for a month.

09:04.123 --> 09:06.148
Office supplies and pizza.

09:06.459 --> 09:09.451
Sounds like somebody's
running a boiler room.

09:09.529 --> 09:13.966
Sure, I remember the orders. Mr.
Tim, he had offices over on Atlantic.

09:14.033 --> 09:16.593
He hasn't ordered since last
month, though. I guess he moved.

09:16.669 --> 09:17.829
You know what kind
of business it was?

09:17.904 --> 09:18.928
No.

09:19.005 --> 09:21.200
But Mr. Tim sent me over a
framed picture of his boss.

09:21.274 --> 09:23.242
He said he was famous or
something, but I never heard of him.

09:23.309 --> 09:25.300
You still have it?
Yeah.

09:27.780 --> 09:29.304
Looks familiar.

09:32.719 --> 09:35.051
There's something
underneath it.

09:37.257 --> 09:38.986
Do you mind
if I open this up?

09:39.058 --> 09:40.992
I ain't putting it back up.

09:48.668 --> 09:53.662
Radcliff. The candidate in the primaries.
Holtzman must be working on his campaign.

09:54.674 --> 09:57.199
Putting out fires
before they start.

10:02.282 --> 10:04.682
<i>This is a rigged auction!
I'm suing Bartleby's...</i>

10:04.751 --> 10:06.013
<i>Sir...
... for tortious interference</i>

10:06.085 --> 10:08.076
<i>I have to hang up now.
... and I'm suing you...</i>

10:09.155 --> 10:14.183
That's me, all right. I'm a
collector of contemporary memorabilia.

10:15.228 --> 10:17.287
<i>Privilege magazine
is an American icon.</i>

10:17.363 --> 10:23.359
The only lot that you bid on was Lot
82. The one with the little black book.

10:23.436 --> 10:25.301
Then there's the way
you muddied your tracks.

10:25.371 --> 10:28.340
The Delaware address,
the Arizona credit card.

10:28.408 --> 10:33.869
Just a sorry but legal attempt
to outrun a youthful indiscretion.

10:34.914 --> 10:40.147
<i>In 1988, I was in New York City and
I met a delightful Privilege Honey</i>

10:40.954 --> 10:44.913
who introduced me to George Merritt,
and I distinctly remember him

10:44.991 --> 10:48.427
putting my name next to hers
in his little black book.

10:48.695 --> 10:50.993
In 1988,
you were in law school?

10:51.064 --> 10:53.999
I was a summer intern
at a New York law firm.

10:54.867 --> 10:58.325
A newly-married intern with
a wife back home in Austin.

10:58.738 --> 11:01.935
I don't need this book
turning up on some website.

11:02.475 --> 11:05.308
I just hope whoever
got it will be discreet.

11:05.378 --> 11:09.280
Well, keep hoping. The lady who
outbid you was murdered two days ago.

11:09.349 --> 11:11.943
The book is missing.

11:12.018 --> 11:13.007
No reaction.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.420
Very politic.

11:18.558 --> 11:21.527
Where was your candidate
in the late '80s?

11:21.594 --> 11:25.223
Jim Radcliff was juggling a young
family and a career in real estate.

11:25.298 --> 11:28.495
You sure he's not the one who got his
name in Merritt's little black book?

11:28.568 --> 11:29.694
You think I'm lying to you?

11:29.769 --> 11:32.761
What we think is, you're doing what
any good campaign manager would do

11:32.839 --> 11:36.297
and that is fall on his sword
to protect his candidate.

11:36.642 --> 11:37.904
Prove it.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.672
Been a pleasure.

11:45.051 --> 11:49.420
Jim Radcliff did a lousy job of
juggling. He got divorced in 1990.

11:50.256 --> 11:52.884
So, Merritt sent over their
only copy of the address book.

11:52.959 --> 11:54.119
There's no Tim Holtzman in it.

11:54.193 --> 11:56.388
Then it's got to be
about Radcliff.

11:56.462 --> 11:58.726
Well, Merritt listed people
by their first names.

11:58.798 --> 12:02.962
All the Jims, Jimmies, Jameses
are all under the letter "J."

12:05.004 --> 12:09.270
There are two entries here
for a Jim, last initial "R."

12:09.542 --> 12:13.205
Well, I checked the phone numbers in
the reverse directories from '89 to '92.

12:13.279 --> 12:16.271
The first one was registered
to a Jim Roberts.

12:16.616 --> 12:18.481
The other one was a
residential hotel, the Morgan,

12:18.551 --> 12:19.882
that closed down
eight years ago.

12:19.952 --> 12:22.386
Radcliff could've lived
there before his divorce.

12:22.455 --> 12:26.323
These initials next
to the name, "BV."

12:26.392 --> 12:27.916
Maybe where Merritt met him?

12:27.994 --> 12:30.895
Well, let's see what
Merritt has under "B."

12:32.031 --> 12:35.296
BV. Bacchus & Venus,
East 48th Street.

12:35.368 --> 12:37.427
I know the place.
Private sex club.

12:37.503 --> 12:40.233
Used to get complaints
about it all the time.

12:40.606 --> 12:42.369
If that's where
Merritt met Radcliff...

12:42.442 --> 12:44.876
A mattress full
of naked swingers.

12:45.344 --> 12:48.780
Not the kind of platform
people want from a candidate.

12:50.616 --> 12:52.584
Bacchus & Venus,
that was a swinging place.

12:52.652 --> 12:54.552
I remember the girls,
but the men?

12:54.620 --> 12:56.588
You're saying
you never met Jim Radcliff?

12:56.656 --> 12:58.590
No. We met at
a benefit last year.

12:58.658 --> 13:02.594
And, yes, he had all his clothes on.
I can't say he's my kind of politician.

13:02.662 --> 13:05.392
So you're saying that Jim
with the last initial "R,"

13:05.465 --> 13:08.229
you're positive that
that's not Radcliff?

13:08.301 --> 13:10.292
I'm not positive
about anything.

13:10.369 --> 13:13.270
The '80s are all
a fantastic blur to me.

13:13.339 --> 13:15.864
I was at Bacchus & Venus
a couple of times a week.

13:15.942 --> 13:20.402
They loved me there. A guy would have
to bring a girl to get in, I'd bring six!

13:20.480 --> 13:25.577
Come on, Honeys, come on. P. Diddy
can't start this party without us.

13:27.887 --> 13:31.152
Talking to that guy's like
walking into a fog bank.

13:31.824 --> 13:35.783
He did say a guy would have to
have a date to get into the club.

13:35.862 --> 13:38.330
Radcliff would've had
to bring a girlfriend.

13:38.397 --> 13:39.591
He was going
through a divorce.

13:39.665 --> 13:42.657
His ex-wife might've been
keeping tabs on him.

13:46.072 --> 13:48.563
Jim and I made it
a condition of our settlement

13:48.641 --> 13:51.701
that we wouldn't discuss
anything related to our divorce,

13:51.777 --> 13:53.472
for our daughter's sake.

13:53.546 --> 13:57.505
Can we ask you where you
lived when you got the divorce?

13:58.050 --> 14:00.450
We had a brownstone
on West 73rd.

14:01.921 --> 14:04.754
It was being renovated
when we separated.

14:04.824 --> 14:08.260
During the renovation, were
you living somewhere else?

14:08.327 --> 14:10.693
Maybe a
residential hotel or...

14:10.763 --> 14:11.787
The Morgan.

14:12.298 --> 14:13.890
I don't know why any
of this is relevant?

14:13.966 --> 14:17.402
We think your ex-husband's
name was in an address book

14:17.470 --> 14:21.566
once owned by George Merritt,
the magazine publisher.

14:21.841 --> 14:25.277
My husband was in real estate.
He met many different people.

14:25.344 --> 14:28.370
It's a matter of
where he met Mr. Merritt.

14:28.447 --> 14:32.884
There was a notation in the book
which indicated it was at a sex club.

14:38.424 --> 14:39.721
This is embarrassing for you.

14:39.792 --> 14:42.556
Jim would never step foot
in a club like that.

14:42.628 --> 14:45.722
Well, if he had, he
couldn't have done it alone.

14:46.832 --> 14:48.299
Maybe you know
who he was seeing...

14:48.367 --> 14:50.232
Look, I told you
this was off-limits.

14:50.303 --> 14:51.827
Jim and I have worked
very hard to get along

14:51.904 --> 14:55.635
for our daughter's sake, and I
will not put that in jeopardy.

14:56.609 --> 14:58.201
Please understand.

14:58.277 --> 15:01.838
We understand that your husband
caused you a lot of hurt.

15:06.552 --> 15:10.613
Hello? Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Those bags came in yesterday.

15:11.057 --> 15:14.458
I'm gonna be at the store in about
a half an hour. Wait. Hold on.

15:14.527 --> 15:16.722
Could you let yourselves out?

15:18.664 --> 15:20.632
Yeah, they're beautiful.

15:21.400 --> 15:26.303
Class act. We gave her a chance to
slam Radcliff and she didn't take it.

15:27.807 --> 15:30.901
But when you mentioned
the sex club, she blushed.

15:30.977 --> 15:33.571
A shame response.
She knew the place.

15:37.049 --> 15:41.179
So far, it's all your
typical divorce tit-for-tat.

15:41.254 --> 15:43.222
This isn't typical, here.

15:43.656 --> 15:46.716
Her deposition in
the custody hearing.

15:49.829 --> 15:51.922
"Jim said he had
a romantic evening planned.

15:51.998 --> 15:55.263
"He took me to a club,
Bacchus & Venus. I was shocked.

15:55.334 --> 15:57.825
"The room was full
of people having sex.

15:57.903 --> 16:00.201
"I wanted to leave,
but Jim told me to humor him.

16:00.273 --> 16:02.207
"Men were looking at me.
I felt dirty.

16:02.275 --> 16:05.438
"Jim told me to perform oral
sex on him while they watched.

16:05.511 --> 16:07.342
"I refused and left. "

16:07.413 --> 16:09.540
And then three months later.

16:09.615 --> 16:12.379
"He insisted we do what he wanted.
But this time, once we were inside

16:12.451 --> 16:16.615
"the sex club, I became physically
ill. I cried. Jim got angry,

16:16.689 --> 16:18.486
"he said I was
spoiling everything,

16:18.557 --> 16:21.025
"that it wasn't sexy
for me to cry. "

16:21.594 --> 16:25.655
A sex fiend and a bully. Politics
is the perfect place for him.

16:26.332 --> 16:29.233
<i>This file hadn't been
looked at since 1994.</i>

16:29.869 --> 16:33.066
And then Monday,
it was signed out.

16:33.139 --> 16:35.369
Two days after
Lila Parsons was murdered.

16:36.375 --> 16:38.468
Signed out by Radcliff's
divorce lawyer.

16:38.544 --> 16:41.274
Well, he knows what's in here,
why would he need to look at it?

16:41.347 --> 16:43.110
Maybe this is what
he was checking.

16:43.182 --> 16:46.413
To see if anyone else
had looked at the file.

16:47.853 --> 16:51.220
A shakedown artist, maybe
that's who stole the book.

16:51.824 --> 16:53.883
My client is not
being blackmailed.

16:53.959 --> 16:56.223
We looked at that file to
clarify a child-support issue,

16:56.295 --> 16:58.058
now that Jim's daughter
is going to college.

16:58.130 --> 17:02.567
Besides which, what Kay said in those
depositions is a total fabrication.

17:03.235 --> 17:05.226
You didn't drag her
to a sex club?

17:05.304 --> 17:09.137
No. We went there once, as a
married couple, out of curiosity.

17:09.842 --> 17:12.503
We were both disturbed by
what we saw and we left.

17:12.578 --> 17:13.567
Hmm.

17:14.313 --> 17:18.249
Hardly seems enough time to meet
George Merritt and give him your number.

17:18.317 --> 17:19.840
That's because I didn't
meet George Merritt.

17:19.919 --> 17:22.819
No, see, you're in his
phone book under "J."

17:23.789 --> 17:26.622
Jim R. And there's your
number at the Morgan Hotel.

17:26.692 --> 17:30.492
Jim sold high-end real estate. No
doubt he's in a lot of address books.

17:30.563 --> 17:34.556
Except the letters
after his name, "BV."

17:35.201 --> 17:41.003
That's Merritt's little, you know, code,
to remind himself of where he met you.

17:43.876 --> 17:47.937
Bacchus & Venus, the sex
club where you took your wife.

17:51.951 --> 17:53.680
Is that
enough proof for you?

17:53.753 --> 17:55.311
You're looking
at it real good.

17:55.388 --> 17:56.719
That's because
we've never seen it.

17:56.789 --> 17:58.780
So the first page, the...

17:59.325 --> 18:02.590
The one that you hardly looked at,
that's the one you've seen before.

18:02.661 --> 18:06.825
Now, did the person that's
blackmailing you send that to you?

18:07.400 --> 18:11.461
Mr. Radcliff has always been a
friend of law enforcement officers.

18:12.204 --> 18:14.399
Even when they make mistakes.

18:21.647 --> 18:25.014
This is why I became a cop,
you make so many friends.

18:25.451 --> 18:27.351
Radcliff's blackmailer,

18:27.920 --> 18:30.013
before he stole the book
from Lila Parsons,

18:30.089 --> 18:32.319
he might've tried
to buy it legitimately.

18:32.391 --> 18:34.382
One of the other bidders.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.121
Well, somebody told
them to check that file!

18:37.196 --> 18:38.857
They didn't come up with
that bright idea on their own!

18:38.931 --> 18:40.626
I didn't tell them anything.
I swear to God, Kay.

18:40.699 --> 18:44.533
You talk to the press, you
confirm one iota of that crap, I...

18:46.272 --> 18:49.241
Regan, there you are.
You're late.

18:50.242 --> 18:51.436
And you're a jerk.

18:51.510 --> 18:52.636
Regan, don't.

18:54.914 --> 18:56.279
Get your stuff, let's go.

18:56.348 --> 18:57.406
No.

18:57.817 --> 19:00.445
You apologize to Mom
or I'm not going.

19:03.722 --> 19:05.622
You deserve each other.

19:08.227 --> 19:10.422
You shouldn't push
your father away, honey.

19:10.496 --> 19:15.024
He just wants people to see him skiing
with his daughter. He's such a phony.

19:18.504 --> 19:22.736
My brave little girl. Never
afraid to look at the truth.

19:25.010 --> 19:26.443
Mr. McKenna?

19:28.013 --> 19:29.981
Please, wait here.
Oh.

19:31.417 --> 19:34.750
Mr. McKenna told the auction house
he worked for Unicorn Crystals.

19:34.820 --> 19:38.347
Mr. McKenna has a lot of
businesses. Only one office.

19:40.626 --> 19:43.527
He was scanning something
onto his computer.

19:45.564 --> 19:48.089
He might've e-mailed it
to somebody.

19:48.801 --> 19:54.068
It's from the address book,
Radcliff's entry. "Now do you believe?"

19:54.507 --> 19:57.237
Must be Part 2 of
a shakedown letter.

19:58.677 --> 20:01.669
The e-mail address,
Texas Hold 'em.

20:01.747 --> 20:02.839
Tim Holtzman.

20:13.259 --> 20:14.453
Decomp.

20:19.331 --> 20:20.355
What's in here?

20:20.432 --> 20:21.421
Storeroom.

20:29.975 --> 20:33.103
Our shakedown artist.
Somebody shook back.

20:39.652 --> 20:43.486
McKenna's phone was last used
at 5:50 Saturday night,

20:43.556 --> 20:47.549
a call to the local deli, just
an hour before he sent the e-mail.

20:48.193 --> 20:52.095
He got six e-mails back from Texas Hold'em.
The first one was Saturday afternoon.

20:53.399 --> 20:55.526
And the next one was
received late Saturday night,

20:55.601 --> 20:57.933
after McKenna sent the proof.

20:58.003 --> 20:59.493
They were
ready to pay up.

20:59.572 --> 21:03.474
They sent four more messages,
asking for McKenna for an answer.

21:04.276 --> 21:07.507
They could've sent them to cover
up the fact they had McKenna killed.

21:07.580 --> 21:09.480
Two small-caliber
entry wounds in the back.

21:09.548 --> 21:11.482
We found blood on
the tops of his shoes.

21:11.550 --> 21:15.714
On the tops? Well, that
wouldn't be his blood.

21:15.788 --> 21:17.551
Might be Lila Parsons's.

21:17.623 --> 21:19.488
And this came back
on his prints.

21:20.926 --> 21:25.192
McKenna has drug beefs, '89
and '90, possession with intent.

21:25.998 --> 21:28.228
Coke and poppers.
Party drugs.

21:30.736 --> 21:32.465
Check out the location
of the arrests.

21:32.538 --> 21:33.527
East 48th...

21:33.606 --> 21:36.006
Party central,
Bacchus & Venus.

21:37.810 --> 21:42.042
The e-mails were traced to an account
owned by your campaign manager.

21:42.348 --> 21:44.179
The implication is clear.

21:44.249 --> 21:46.114
Maybe to you. If you think
you can make a case...

21:46.185 --> 21:47.550
I don't like liars.

21:47.620 --> 21:48.917
Either he tells
us what he knows,

21:48.988 --> 21:52.822
or I'll drag him before the
grand jury and put him under oath.

21:56.729 --> 22:00.961
We received a demand for $1 million
in exchange for the address book.

22:01.900 --> 22:04.528
Against my better judgment,
we agreed.

22:04.970 --> 22:07.700
But we never heard back
from the other party.

22:07.773 --> 22:10.435
This is the other party.
You know him?

22:12.945 --> 22:13.934
I've never seen him.

22:14.013 --> 22:15.241
You sure?

22:15.581 --> 22:17.981
Rob McKenna.

22:18.050 --> 22:21.076
This is what he looked like when
he was a bouncer at Bacchus & Venus.

22:21.520 --> 22:25.718
I don't remember him. I only went to the
club five times, then I lost interest.

22:25.791 --> 22:28.988
You don't know McKenna, but
he knew you were in the book.

22:29.061 --> 22:30.050
I can't explain it.

22:30.129 --> 22:33.724
McKenna had a partner. Someone
you told you were in the book.

22:33.799 --> 22:35.096
No, I never told anyone.

22:35.167 --> 22:39.729
You didn't brag to your buddy boys
about meeting George Merritt at an orgy?

22:40.072 --> 22:43.667
It's not as sexy as making your
wife cry in front of a room...

22:43.742 --> 22:46.802
Mr. Carver, my client does not
need to be subjected to this...

22:46.879 --> 22:49.677
Your client needs to
answer the question.

22:55.087 --> 22:58.147
The first I heard of this auction
is when George Merritt called

22:58.223 --> 23:01.056
and warned me that
the book was up for sale.

23:01.126 --> 23:03.856
He reminded me
my name was in it

23:03.929 --> 23:06.898
and that I might wanna keep
it out of the wrong hands.

23:07.599 --> 23:10.124
I told Holtzman
to take care of it.

23:12.304 --> 23:14.363
I was performing
a public service.

23:14.440 --> 23:17.807
You told us Radcliff wasn't
your kind of politician.

23:17.876 --> 23:21.778
That was before you said you
weren't positive he was in your book.

23:21.847 --> 23:23.781
If you're going to pay
attention to what I say.

23:23.849 --> 23:26.249
What do you think,
for the July Honey, huh?

23:26.318 --> 23:29.082
Yeah, the reason that
you called Radcliff

23:29.154 --> 23:31.918
was because you were priming
the pump for the auction.

23:31.990 --> 23:35.983
Oh, enlightened self-interest is
the best kind of public service.

23:39.198 --> 23:43.396
Oh, was that me? I'm sorry.

23:45.070 --> 23:46.628
Did you call anyone else?

23:46.705 --> 23:47.899
I might have.

23:48.273 --> 23:49.706
Throw me some names.

23:49.775 --> 23:50.867
Rob McKenna.

23:51.744 --> 23:54.304
He supplied party favors
at Bacchus & Venus.

23:54.379 --> 23:57.075
Yeah, I know who he is.
I didn't call him.

23:57.149 --> 24:01.210
He called me to place a
pre-emptive bid on the book.

24:02.354 --> 24:04.584
Said he was being a gentleman
on behalf of a friend

24:04.656 --> 24:06.055
who thought they
might be in the book.

24:06.125 --> 24:09.117
I told him to get on line
like everybody else.

24:09.194 --> 24:10.183
Georgie?

24:10.262 --> 24:11.286
Hmm.

24:11.363 --> 24:12.523
The game's stuck.

24:12.598 --> 24:14.896
I'll be right there.
Excuse me.

24:16.068 --> 24:18.127
What is it, sweetie?
The game won't go.

24:18.203 --> 24:23.072
A gentleman. That's a word that men use
sometimes when they're helping a lady.

24:23.142 --> 24:27.306
Maybe McKenna's friend was a lady
who knew Radcliff was in the book.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.474
And I can think of one.
Kay Connolly.

24:34.586 --> 24:37.612
Who would blackmail Jim?
Did he tell you this?

24:37.689 --> 24:41.853
He got an extortion demand about
his activities at the sex club.

24:42.461 --> 24:45.123
That doesn't make any sense.
I told you that was all lies.

24:45.197 --> 24:48.564
We read your deposition. We know
what your husband put you through,

24:48.634 --> 24:50.033
taking you to that club.

24:50.102 --> 24:52.536
My husband said
I was too uptight.

24:54.306 --> 24:55.705
Too conventional.

24:55.774 --> 24:57.366
He wanted you to experiment.

25:03.348 --> 25:06.749
I'II... I'll just... Do you mind
if I shut this? We need to...

25:06.819 --> 25:07.808
It's okay, honey.

25:07.886 --> 25:10.252
...talk to your
Mom in private.

25:11.456 --> 25:12.445
Uh-huh.

25:19.965 --> 25:22.729
I told him if he let
the genie out of the bottle,

25:22.801 --> 25:24.530
then he would
destroy our marriage,

25:24.603 --> 25:26.662
and that's what he did.

25:26.738 --> 25:29.605
Well, we found the man
who was blackmailing him.

25:29.675 --> 25:33.111
His name's Rob McKenna.
He was a bouncer at that club.

25:33.679 --> 25:34.668
No.

25:34.746 --> 25:36.338
This guy's
a jack-of-all-trades.

25:36.415 --> 25:39.077
This year, he was
selling beachwear.

25:39.151 --> 25:43.554
Last year he was selling
women's leather belts.

25:43.956 --> 25:46.948
In fact, he had a booth
at the Women's Accessory Show.

25:47.025 --> 25:49.960
The show's organizers
said you were there, too.

25:50.028 --> 25:52.462
Yeah, well,
he even gave us a map.

25:53.866 --> 25:57.233
This is where his booth was here,
and right across the aisle was yours.

25:57.302 --> 26:00.703
Oh, right.
Now I do remember. Rob.

26:00.772 --> 26:02.637
Right, Rob.
Good old Rob.

26:02.941 --> 26:06.035
So what did he do?
He was just chatting you up?

26:06.111 --> 26:08.443
He remembered me
from the club.

26:08.947 --> 26:12.644
The time that I freaked out
and Jim got angry with me.

26:13.852 --> 26:15.649
I guess I made an impression.

26:15.721 --> 26:20.954
I'll say, him remembering you
just from that one time in 1989.

26:21.026 --> 26:24.154
Just so we know that we're
talking about the same guy here,

26:24.229 --> 26:28.188
can you describe what he
looked like back then in 1989?

26:29.735 --> 26:34.638
He had hair that was combed
forward, like a Caesar cut.

26:34.706 --> 26:38.574
And he had a small,
little beard.

26:38.644 --> 26:40.271
Oh, a soul patch.

26:44.883 --> 26:47.351
Yes, that's how
I remembered him.

26:52.257 --> 26:55.954
So this is what he looked like
in '89, when he was arrested.

26:56.528 --> 26:59.964
And this is what he looked like
in '91. This is when Kay met him.

27:00.032 --> 27:04.093
Two years after she was at the
club with Radcliff. She lied to us.

27:04.603 --> 27:07.333
She was a divorced
woman in '91. Single.

27:08.674 --> 27:11.734
The genie out of the bottle?
Maybe it was hers.

27:12.611 --> 27:14.670
You turned off your cell.

27:14.746 --> 27:15.770
Let go!

27:15.847 --> 27:17.178
Let me see.
Let me see!

27:17.249 --> 27:18.682
Stop it!
Let me see your arm!

27:18.750 --> 27:20.615
Stop it!
I didn't do anything.

27:20.686 --> 27:21.744
Let me see!

27:21.820 --> 27:26.257
Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't
you tell me what he did to you?

27:26.959 --> 27:29.393
I didn't think
you'd understand, honey.

27:29.461 --> 27:32.191
You promised
to tell me everything!

27:34.866 --> 27:38.427
I know. I'm sorry,
sweetheart, I'm so sorry.

27:39.571 --> 27:44.133
How could he take you to a
place like that? I hate him.

27:50.382 --> 27:54.079
Found her. "Monique. "

27:56.054 --> 27:57.681
And the phone number
was registered

27:57.756 --> 28:01.852
to Kay under her married name
from '90 to '92.

28:03.161 --> 28:09.259
Monique. "Choochoo"? As in the
little engine that pulled the train?

28:11.103 --> 28:12.764
Multiple partners.

28:13.939 --> 28:17.033
Must be what she became
known for at the club.

28:17.109 --> 28:20.476
Well, I've heard of
post-divorce follies, but this...

28:21.880 --> 28:25.043
She didn't want the book
to blackmail Radcliff.

28:26.318 --> 28:29.185
She needed it to
bury her own past.

28:33.558 --> 28:37.460
Monique... Monique... No,
I'm sorry. I guess I...

28:38.130 --> 28:39.757
I don't remember
the girls after all.

28:39.831 --> 28:40.957
And Choochoo?

28:41.033 --> 28:43.331
Oh, exactly what
the name implied.

28:44.503 --> 28:48.064
Whoever that girl was, she saw more traffic
in one night than the Holland Tunnel.

28:51.109 --> 28:53.805
Oh, come on. It was
harmless fun, you know.

28:53.879 --> 28:54.868
Thank you, Mr. Merritt.

28:54.946 --> 28:56.004
Oh.

29:07.659 --> 29:10.594
Honeys! Here we go.

29:11.296 --> 29:12.354
Nice to
meet you. Bye.

29:12.431 --> 29:13.420
Bye.

29:17.569 --> 29:19.969
Maybe Ms. Connolly
isn't Monique.

29:21.106 --> 29:23.574
Maybe Merritt wrote down
the wrong number.

29:23.642 --> 29:24.802
Hell of a coincidence.

29:24.876 --> 29:27.606
Maybe the blackmail scheme
was just a lure.

29:27.679 --> 29:30.170
It's how Kay got McKenna to
front for her at the auction.

29:30.248 --> 29:33.615
When he was outbid, he saw
his meal ticket slip away,

29:33.685 --> 29:37.018
so he killed Lila Parsons
to get the book back.

29:37.789 --> 29:40.223
Before Kay knew
what he was up to,

29:40.659 --> 29:43.287
McKenna tried to sell
the book to Radcliff,

29:43.361 --> 29:45.352
that's the last place Kay
would want it to wind up.

29:45.430 --> 29:47.557
So, she put a stop
to it with two slugs.

29:47.632 --> 29:50.100
If in fact Kay Connolly
is Monique.

29:51.002 --> 29:52.526
Find a witness.

29:53.238 --> 29:55.968
Her daughter Regan would've
been three or four at the time.

29:56.041 --> 30:00.102
A nanny or a babysitter. If Kay
paid by check, we can find her.

30:04.316 --> 30:08.184
Regan was such a lively girl.
She is all right, isn't she?

30:08.253 --> 30:12.155
As far as we can tell. You were
her nanny for a year and a half.

30:12.224 --> 30:15.990
A record. Her other
nannies lasted six months.

30:18.063 --> 30:21.555
Ms. Connolly had a very
active social life.

30:23.635 --> 30:27.435
And you were stuck baby-sitting
till her mother rolled home.

30:27.906 --> 30:30.431
Once she was gone
for three days.

30:31.109 --> 30:33.304
She came back looking like...

30:34.045 --> 30:37.208
She smelled of drink and sex.

30:38.150 --> 30:40.380
She was a lonely,
unhappy woman.

30:40.452 --> 30:41.942
Any idea where she'd been?

30:43.021 --> 30:45.683
I heard men leaving messages
on her machine,

30:45.757 --> 30:48.783
saying they'd met her at
this club. It had two names.

30:48.860 --> 30:50.157
Bacchus & Venus.

30:50.228 --> 30:51.286
That's it.

30:51.363 --> 30:53.661
Was Regan aware that
there was something wrong?

30:53.732 --> 30:56.394
Ms. Connolly would tell her
she'd be home to tuck her in,

30:56.468 --> 30:57.935
but she'd never make it back.

30:58.003 --> 31:00.369
Just one broken promise
after another.

31:00.438 --> 31:03.601
Regan would line up her dolls
neatly on the bed,

31:04.342 --> 31:09.302
she'd sit up, forcing herself to stay
awake until Ms. Connolly came home.

31:09.614 --> 31:12.481
When you asked if
Regan was all right,

31:12.918 --> 31:16.319
did you have anything special
to be concerned about?

31:18.156 --> 31:22.024
I'm not even sure. But five
years ago, I got a call.

31:22.994 --> 31:25.224
It was a young girl,
11 or 12.

31:26.498 --> 31:27.624
She sounded drunk.

31:27.699 --> 31:29.098
What did she say?

31:30.235 --> 31:32.669
She said she was
going to kill me.

31:33.405 --> 31:37.364
I heard giggling in the background,
but the girl was very angry.

31:38.009 --> 31:40.443
She said she'd found a gun
in her mother's store

31:40.512 --> 31:42.605
and she knew how to use it.

31:43.014 --> 31:45.915
The store. That's how
you knew it was Regan.

31:47.819 --> 31:51.721
When are you going
to be home? Okay.

31:55.493 --> 31:58.826
My mom said she can't come home
yet, there's police at the store.

31:58.897 --> 32:01.798
Do you have any idea
what we're looking for?

32:02.400 --> 32:05.699
You know, we talked to your
old nanny, Mrs. Brendan.

32:07.806 --> 32:11.173
She said that you called
her five years ago.

32:13.945 --> 32:15.913
What?
We dug up an old phone record.

32:15.981 --> 32:17.710
You want to see it?

32:18.617 --> 32:21.609
Do you remember
what you said?

32:21.686 --> 32:22.675
I was goofing.

32:23.555 --> 32:26.922
You told her that you found
something in your mom's store and that

32:26.992 --> 32:29.358
you'd kill Mrs. Brendan
with it.

32:29.427 --> 32:30.416
I didn't mean it.

32:30.695 --> 32:33.357
Mrs. Brendan said
you sounded drunk.

32:33.431 --> 32:34.728
I used to get drunk a lot.

32:35.700 --> 32:37.463
But now you're okay.

32:42.540 --> 32:45.839
"Hamilton Heights Literacy
Program. " Is this yours?

32:46.945 --> 32:48.003
Yeah. I volunteer.

32:48.079 --> 32:50.673
That's great.
You should hold on to it.

32:51.283 --> 32:55.379
Was there anything else?
Besides the drinking?

32:55.954 --> 33:00.653
At the store, I noticed that
you pulled down your sleeves.

33:08.066 --> 33:09.556
You're hiding scars?

33:09.634 --> 33:10.760
I'm not a junkie.

33:11.436 --> 33:13.097
You were a cutter?

33:17.208 --> 33:19.438
Who were you mad at?
Your mom?

33:22.414 --> 33:25.315
Mom and I are tight now.
We're best friends.

33:25.650 --> 33:28.847
You worked on it? You went
to counseling together?

33:31.156 --> 33:32.214
Yes.

33:34.959 --> 33:37.450
Mrs. Brendan told us that
after your parents got divorced,

33:37.529 --> 33:40.430
that your mother spent a
lot of time away from home.

33:40.498 --> 33:42.796
Did that come up
in counseling?

33:44.669 --> 33:45.727
Yes.

33:46.071 --> 33:49.598
You thought that it was your
fault that she stayed away.

33:50.041 --> 33:54.944
You thought that if you kept your room
clean and neat, and lined up all your dolls,

33:55.013 --> 34:01.179
that she'd see that you were a good
girl and she'd love you more, stay home?

34:01.853 --> 34:05.084
It was my dad's fault.
He dumped us.

34:06.257 --> 34:10.387
And Mom had to work all the time, that's
why she couldn't be at home with me.

34:10.462 --> 34:14.364
Did she tell you that in counseling?
That she was working late?

34:14.998 --> 34:18.867
Yes. She worked really hard.

34:21.139 --> 34:25.098
While Dad...
I know what he did to her.

34:28.513 --> 34:32.779
Her self-destructive behavior is a
symptom of her attachment disorder.

34:33.952 --> 34:35.681
She felt abandoned
by everyone,

34:35.754 --> 34:38.154
by her mother,
especially by her mother.

34:38.223 --> 34:41.659
They went to therapy to
rebuild the bond between them,

34:41.726 --> 34:44.126
rebuild it on a foundation
of trust and truth.

34:44.195 --> 34:45.492
And what did Kay do?
She lied.

34:45.563 --> 34:47.087
Tough to tell your kid
you neglected them

34:47.165 --> 34:49.496
because you were too busy
romancing the 7th Fleet.

34:49.567 --> 34:51.728
Well, the girl might
forgive her for her conduct,

34:51.803 --> 34:53.065
but not for lying about it.

34:53.138 --> 34:56.630
Kay had to be worried about what
would happen if Regan found out.

34:56.708 --> 35:00.269
Find out how? It's an anonymous
entry in an address book.

35:01.146 --> 35:05.310
With a phone number that Radcliff would
recognize if it ended up in his hands.

35:05.383 --> 35:06.850
That's who might tell Regan.

35:06.918 --> 35:09.614
Well, nice theory, but after
serving two search warrants,

35:09.687 --> 35:12.417
there's still no gun
or an address book.

35:12.490 --> 35:15.653
Well, we still have a copy
of the address book.

35:16.928 --> 35:20.295
She didn't want the truth
falling in the wrong hands.

35:21.733 --> 35:24.930
Why don't we give her
something to worry about?

35:25.003 --> 35:27.403
No, I don't know
anyone named Monique.

35:27.472 --> 35:32.239
No, see, next to her name, Mr.
Merritt wrote down your phone number

35:32.310 --> 35:34.505
at your old brownstone
on 73rd.

35:34.579 --> 35:35.568
It's a mistake.

35:35.647 --> 35:37.114
No, no, the number's right.

35:37.182 --> 35:40.948
It's a hot little number, too,
going by the notes that Merritt made.

35:41.019 --> 35:42.145
Let me see it.

35:42.220 --> 35:45.986
Sorry, Mr. Radcliff, you're not
entitled to examine grand jury evidence.

35:46.057 --> 35:47.752
Grand jury? What are
you talking about?

35:47.826 --> 35:51.819
We believe Monique knew your
client's blackmailer, Mr. McKenna.

35:52.130 --> 35:55.657
And she obviously knew Mr. Radcliff,
since she was living at his place.

35:55.733 --> 35:59.191
Turns out you and McKenna had
a very close mutual friend,

35:59.270 --> 36:02.762
which makes us wonder why you
lied to us about not knowing him.

36:02.841 --> 36:06.971
I'll be seeking Mr. Radcliff's
indictment for Mr. McKenna's murder.

36:07.045 --> 36:11.505
That is ridiculous! I'm telling
you, I did not know these people.

36:11.950 --> 36:14.384
Mr. Carver, I'm serving notice
that I'm putting my client

36:14.452 --> 36:17.751
in front of your grand jury and I want
access to all of your grand jury evidence,

36:17.822 --> 36:19.551
including the contents
of the address book.

36:19.624 --> 36:22.525
Not without a judge's order.

36:22.594 --> 36:23.618
Fine with me.

36:25.129 --> 36:27.256
Antonia, please come in.

36:29.868 --> 36:32.166
That's the address
for Ms. Kay Connolly.

36:32.237 --> 36:34.899
As soon as we get a court date
for Mr. Talbot's motion,

36:34.973 --> 36:36.964
please send her a notice.

36:40.945 --> 36:44.813
Under CPL Section 190.50, my
client has an absolute right

36:44.883 --> 36:47.477
to testify on his own behalf
before the grand jury.

36:47.552 --> 36:50.885
And to prepare his testimony, he
must be allowed to review the evidence

36:50.955 --> 36:52.820
Mr. Carver intends to
present against him.

36:52.891 --> 36:55.860
Your Honor, Mr. Talbot is alluding
to a copy of an address book,

36:55.927 --> 36:58.725
specifically to an entry
under the name "Monique. "

36:58.796 --> 37:02.095
Since I have no intention of
asking Mr. Radcliff any questions

37:02.166 --> 37:05.863
about that document, I see no
basis to turn it over to him.

37:06.437 --> 37:09.429
That is the lamest argument
I've heard in a month.

37:09.507 --> 37:12.408
If it's evidence, he has
a right to examine it.

37:12.477 --> 37:14.001
I'm granting his motion.

37:14.078 --> 37:16.478
You have till the end of business
day to turn over the address book.

37:22.420 --> 37:25.685
Mr. Carver, Bonnie Wells.
I represent Kay Connolly.

37:25.757 --> 37:27.622
Can I have a word
with you in private?

37:27.692 --> 37:29.057
Of course.

37:31.729 --> 37:34.823
You're suggesting I appeal
the judge's order?

37:36.901 --> 37:37.925
What's your interest here?

37:38.002 --> 37:41.460
My client wants to limit access to
the book, since it brings to light

37:41.539 --> 37:44.303
her husband's behavior
during their marriage.

37:44.375 --> 37:47.003
She wants to shield her
daughter from that information.

37:47.078 --> 37:50.878
She already knows her father
dragged her mother to sex clubs.

37:52.350 --> 37:56.081
It's not his behavior that's
the problem. It's yours.

37:58.690 --> 38:03.525
You know, the evidence of it. That's what
you want to keep away from Jim, right?

38:04.295 --> 38:08.595
I didn't do anything. It
was Jim who humiliated me.

38:08.666 --> 38:12.796
He did. He bullied you, he made
you feel worthless and undesirable.

38:13.871 --> 38:17.602
Was it to prove him wrong
that you became Monique?

38:21.512 --> 38:25.573
To make yourself feel more
powerful by being desired?

38:29.621 --> 38:32.681
I don't know what...
What you're talking about.

38:33.224 --> 38:35.522
I'm talking
about this, Monique.

38:37.028 --> 38:39.758
This phone number
and this notation

38:39.831 --> 38:42.891
and this description of you.

38:42.967 --> 38:46.130
Come on, you know what it
means now, don't you?

38:46.738 --> 38:48.729
We talked
to Regan's nanny.

38:48.806 --> 38:51.900
She heard the messages
men left on your machine.

38:52.610 --> 38:56.876
She knows what you were doing when
you came home late or not at all.

39:00.051 --> 39:02.713
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

39:03.254 --> 39:07.748
You haven't explained yourself at all,
to anyone, much less your daughter.

39:09.027 --> 39:12.292
You know that once he figures this
out, he will use it to vilify you.

39:12.363 --> 39:14.854
He will cast you
as a bad mother,

39:14.932 --> 39:17.696
who has abandoned
their child to...

39:19.470 --> 39:21.961
To satisfy her
pathological lust.

39:22.707 --> 39:25.733
He will drive a wedge
between you and Regan.

39:25.810 --> 39:28.108
Regan, who thinks that
you were absent in her life

39:28.179 --> 39:31.740
because you were working
so hard to provide for her.

39:31.816 --> 39:34.080
Please, put yourself
in my place.

39:34.152 --> 39:36.211
How could I ever tell her
what I was doing?

39:36.287 --> 39:39.654
No, you cannot tell her,
but now your ex-husband will.

39:40.324 --> 39:42.224
And she will believe that
this bond between you,

39:42.293 --> 39:45.319
the one that you worked
so hard to salvage,

39:45.396 --> 39:48.854
was based on nothing
but lies and mistrust.

39:50.435 --> 39:52.835
And then she'll
be lost to you.

39:54.806 --> 39:58.435
No, you can't let this happen.
You can't let Jim see it.

39:58.509 --> 40:00.170
You can't, please.

40:00.511 --> 40:04.504
I'm sorry, but as long as Mr.
Radcliff remains our suspect, he...

40:05.183 --> 40:07.651
He has a right
to this evidence.

40:07.719 --> 40:10.984
I beg you, please, for my daughter's
sake, what it would do to her.

40:11.055 --> 40:13.785
She's hurt herself
so much. Please.

40:16.327 --> 40:18.761
As long as he
remains a suspect,

40:18.830 --> 40:20.161
that's what you said,
Mr. Carver?

40:20.231 --> 40:21.255
Hmm-hmm.

40:21.332 --> 40:25.894
But if he stops being a suspect, then
he's not entitled to see this, right?

40:26.170 --> 40:28.968
Yes, but it would take a lot
to convince me of his innocence.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.439
Kay, we've done
all we could here.

40:30.508 --> 40:34.604
Hang on. What would it take
to convince you, Mr. Carver?

40:36.280 --> 40:39.181
Someone else confessing
to McKenna's murder?

40:40.518 --> 40:42.383
Yes. That would do it.

40:45.389 --> 40:46.378
Kay, come on.

40:46.457 --> 40:49.392
No, but isn't it true
that if she confessed,

40:51.262 --> 40:54.390
<i>then your behavior at
that club 14 years ago,</i>

40:55.299 --> 40:57.631
it would not have
to be exposed.

41:01.139 --> 41:03.573
If she confessed and
agreed to a plea bargain,

41:03.641 --> 41:07.133
she would not have to reveal
the motives of her acts.

41:07.211 --> 41:10.510
And this address book,
the only existing copy of it?

41:10.982 --> 41:14.884
If she waived the right to appeal,
the copy would be destroyed.

41:15.219 --> 41:18.313
And then the past would
be in the past, you see?

41:18.723 --> 41:22.090
And nobody could use it
against you or to hurt Regan.

41:22.894 --> 41:27.593
You could tell her you killed McKenna
to stop him from blackmailing her father.

41:27.665 --> 41:29.394
You'll be her hero.

41:33.337 --> 41:35.737
And then she'll stand by you,

41:35.807 --> 41:38.708
and if sometime you have the
strength to tell her the truth,

41:38.776 --> 41:40.903
then you tell her the truth.

41:43.915 --> 41:46.850
But until then, this is
what you have to do.

41:50.254 --> 41:51.653
Yes.
Kay.

41:52.924 --> 41:56.917
No, I can't... I can't lose
her. I can't lose her again.

42:02.066 --> 42:04.660
I thought my name might be
in the book, and then

42:04.735 --> 42:08.694
I saw at the preview that it
wasn't just my name, but Jim's.

42:08.773 --> 42:11.367
You knew he would try to buy it,
to protect his political future.

42:11.442 --> 42:12.500
Yes.

42:13.644 --> 42:15.236
And I was so relieved
when that woman got it.

42:15.313 --> 42:18.942
But then Rob killed her and
tried to sell the book to Jim.

42:20.318 --> 42:21.615
And he...

42:24.222 --> 42:27.988
He would turn her against me.
He would.

42:30.094 --> 42:32.119
I couldn't run that risk.

42:35.266 --> 42:36.756
She loves me.

42:38.669 --> 42:40.466
And she's all I have.

42:52.683 --> 42:54.878
Did you catch Jim Radcliff's
press conference this morning?

42:54.952 --> 42:58.149
We were too busy sugaring our coffees
at a crime scene. What did we miss?

42:58.222 --> 43:00.747
Since his ex-wife will be
spending 20-to-life in prison,

43:00.825 --> 43:03.817
Mr. Radcliff is withdrawing
from the primaries

43:03.895 --> 43:06.523
to devote more time
to their daughter.

43:07.231 --> 43:09.028
Who wants to do
the honors?

43:09.100 --> 43:10.761
It's all yours, Counselor.

43:11.235 --> 43:12.702
Harmless fun.
