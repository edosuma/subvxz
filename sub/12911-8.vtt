00:53.750 --> 00:55.251
Well?

00:55.451 --> 00:57.453
What's going on out there?

00:58.421 --> 01:01.591
You were right, they've gone nuts.

01:01.791 --> 01:03.893
They all suspect one another,

01:04.393 --> 01:06.395
the alley kids only move in groups,

01:06.596 --> 01:09.398
and Scianel's guys are asking around
to show she's not connected.

01:09.632 --> 01:10.533
Mulatto?

01:10.733 --> 01:12.735
He says Prince and him
were like brothers

01:12.968 --> 01:14.770
and now he wants Dwarf's head.

01:23.145 --> 01:24.947
What does Ciro say?

01:25.180 --> 01:27.149
He's called a meeting.

01:27.349 --> 01:29.151
Sure, that's his priority,

01:29.351 --> 01:32.354
that scum
still believes in democracy.

01:34.789 --> 01:38.059
Democracy can't work,
dogs devour each other

01:38.326 --> 01:40.495
if there's no whip.

01:51.039 --> 01:54.041
Malamore wants to know what to do.

01:54.242 --> 01:57.245
We wait till the poison
gets into their hearts.

02:23.937 --> 02:25.839
We all know who did it.

02:26.039 --> 02:28.308
We can't let someone

02:28.508 --> 02:31.311
kill one of us and not make a move.

02:31.511 --> 02:33.379
Prince forgave him for everything,

02:33.646 --> 02:35.648
but it wasn't enough
for Dwarf.

02:35.882 --> 02:37.884
He's your friend,
but he's gotta pay.

02:38.084 --> 02:39.852
First we see who really did it.

02:40.019 --> 02:42.321
We all know it was Dwarf!

02:42.522 --> 02:43.589
I don't know a fucking thing!

02:43.790 --> 02:47.393
I know Pietro Savastano
vanished, I want to know

02:47.627 --> 02:51.230
if he's sticking to our deal
or siding up with someone.

02:51.430 --> 02:54.633
Ciro, say what you have to!

02:54.834 --> 02:56.302
That's why we're here.

02:56.535 --> 02:59.672
We all know
your Raffaele's getting out,

03:00.706 --> 03:04.209
he's hungry and you want
him to find the table set.

03:04.476 --> 03:07.546
We want to make you both happy,
and you too.

03:07.746 --> 03:10.449
You lost a good friend,
you want justice.

03:10.615 --> 03:12.851
But we have to understand,

03:13.085 --> 03:16.154
we gotta be sure
there's no sly guy behind this.

03:17.422 --> 03:19.224
I take full responsibility.

03:19.424 --> 03:22.427
It's me guaranteeing your appetites,

03:22.627 --> 03:25.830
but this hunger can't put us
at each other's throats.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.869
Dwarf's my business.

03:32.070 --> 03:34.472
If he killed Prince,
I'll make him pay,

03:34.672 --> 03:38.276
but touch him without permission
and I'll make you eat your own hands,

03:38.476 --> 03:39.877
one finger at a time.

03:56.159 --> 03:57.961
Gimme the lighter.

04:24.987 --> 04:27.390
- Why are you going?
- He wants to see me.

04:27.590 --> 04:29.592
- Aren't you scared?
- Of what?

04:29.792 --> 04:31.594
We're brothers.

04:33.295 --> 04:37.199
Your brother let you
be humiliated in front of everyone.

04:37.399 --> 04:39.068
He couldn't do a thing, Teresa.

04:39.268 --> 04:41.470
That's what you want to believe.

04:41.670 --> 04:43.872
You don't know
what you're talking about.

04:44.573 --> 04:46.808
I know what I hear on the streets.

04:46.975 --> 04:48.777
From who?

04:48.977 --> 04:50.412
Everybody.

04:50.579 --> 04:52.981
They all say the same thing,

04:53.181 --> 04:55.183
that it was you.

04:55.550 --> 04:58.453
- Did you kill Prince?
- I didn't do it.

04:58.620 --> 05:00.622
And Ciro knows that.

05:02.223 --> 05:05.226
Scianel held a meeting
with everyone today.

05:06.427 --> 05:09.831
A friend who knows
her daughter-in-law, told me.

05:10.631 --> 05:13.234
It's just women's gossip.

05:13.434 --> 05:16.437
They're plotting
to split your dealing spot.

05:17.238 --> 05:19.040
Your brother's digging your grave.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.642
A grave? My brother?

05:23.344 --> 05:27.348
If I had to choose between him and
you, I'd always choose him.

05:27.982 --> 05:32.786
You're my life, but you can drop dead
if what I say's not true.

06:16.462 --> 06:19.665
They found him outside a warehouse
in Casavatore.

06:19.865 --> 06:23.268
- Why was Gabriele there?
- His animal was there.

06:25.737 --> 06:27.439
He usually went alone?

06:27.639 --> 06:30.642
With Angelino Sepino,
he used to take care of the animal.

06:31.076 --> 06:32.844
I don't know who did it,

06:33.078 --> 06:36.882
but Prince couldn't see evil,
he had no idea.

06:47.659 --> 06:50.261
We find Angelo Sepino, I want him.

06:50.461 --> 06:52.263
That shit knows everything.

06:52.463 --> 06:55.066
Go to his house, find him.

06:55.266 --> 06:57.868
Anyone who stands in the way
ends badly.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.394
Remember when we met?

07:59.461 --> 08:01.463
At Saint Anthony's Day,

08:01.997 --> 08:03.799
20 years ago,

08:04.600 --> 08:06.401
we were kids.

08:07.836 --> 08:10.238
Our gang was super cool!

08:11.540 --> 08:13.742
All our friends are here.

08:13.942 --> 08:15.343
Nicola...

08:17.946 --> 08:20.348
they killed him in 2006.

08:23.251 --> 08:24.853
Doughnut...

08:25.753 --> 08:27.555
what a character!

08:31.459 --> 08:33.861
He fell in love with the wrong woman.

08:35.530 --> 08:37.530
It's just me and you left.

08:45.806 --> 08:47.207
Know what I think?

08:48.642 --> 08:51.645
You killed him because
you were jealous of him and me.

08:54.047 --> 08:56.049
I didn't do it.

08:57.050 --> 09:00.053
You said to trust you and I did.

09:00.887 --> 09:01.955
Rosario,

09:03.457 --> 09:05.859
I don't want
to come visit you in here.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.069
Leave with your daughter and Teresa.

09:16.269 --> 09:18.471
Look me in the face, it's me!

09:18.905 --> 09:23.476
Our allies kiss on the mouth and
shoot one another in the head.

09:23.676 --> 09:27.780
We're the guys from Secondigliano.
Let's break this Alliance.

09:27.947 --> 09:31.250
I won't, not for you or anyone.

09:32.685 --> 09:36.088
- You don't believe I didn't do it?
- You didn't?

09:38.691 --> 09:40.693
Then I have to prove it.

09:41.260 --> 09:45.230
This thing's gone too far,
everyone's poisoned, even me.

09:47.466 --> 09:49.534
If I'm to save your life, leave.

10:16.315 --> 10:18.183
We have to leave.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.585
Okay, we'll go, so what?

10:20.786 --> 10:22.788
We'll go, you and me.

10:47.945 --> 10:49.547
Put this in the car.

10:49.747 --> 10:51.348
What's the matter?

10:51.549 --> 10:53.951
Nothing, I have to go for a few days.

10:54.151 --> 10:55.953
No problem.

10:56.153 --> 10:58.756
But nothing changes here,
it's still all my stuff.

10:59.556 --> 11:03.627
If anyone in the Alliance
fucks around, shoot his eyeballs.

11:03.827 --> 11:05.662
Don't worry.

11:05.862 --> 11:08.265
Put more lookouts around the spot,

11:08.465 --> 11:10.534
they'd better not dare, we rule here.

11:10.767 --> 11:14.938
This is your stuff and ours too,
we'll defend it like our own home.

11:15.138 --> 11:16.339
Good.

11:16.539 --> 11:19.542
I'll call soon to tell you
where to bring the money.

11:20.977 --> 11:23.980
If anything happens to me,
the money's for them.

11:24.581 --> 11:26.282
Look at me, I gotta be sure.

11:26.482 --> 11:28.451
I swear on my life.

11:31.187 --> 11:32.789
Bye.

11:39.795 --> 11:41.597
Take care.

12:26.908 --> 12:31.112
Lazio Coast

13:00.707 --> 13:02.909
See how pretty it is here?

13:06.279 --> 13:08.581
Mommy, when are we going home?

13:08.781 --> 13:10.983
Soon, real soon.

13:12.985 --> 13:14.854
Know what we'll do?

13:15.054 --> 13:18.858
We'll go swimming,
while your classmates study.

13:23.562 --> 13:25.564
Won't the water be cold?

13:25.798 --> 13:27.266
Nah,

13:27.466 --> 13:29.068
let's go!

13:29.368 --> 13:30.769
Come on!

13:47.218 --> 13:49.020
I'm sorry,

13:50.288 --> 13:52.891
I didn't mean those things I said.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.662
People say lots of things
when they argue.

14:01.199 --> 14:03.067
I knew it.

14:03.267 --> 14:04.869
What?

14:06.237 --> 14:07.705
He did it.

14:09.707 --> 14:11.509
He did what?

14:13.210 --> 14:15.212
He killed Debora.

14:18.415 --> 14:20.818
He killed his daughter's mother.

14:23.654 --> 14:27.858
How could I think
he'd hesitate to betray a brother?

14:31.962 --> 14:33.663
Ciro killed Debora?

14:36.633 --> 14:38.401
You knew it?

14:45.208 --> 14:47.010
You helped him?

15:38.393 --> 15:41.629
I'll go shower, then we'll play.

15:42.597 --> 15:44.599
I like being with you.

15:47.201 --> 15:49.403
I like being with you too.

15:49.603 --> 15:51.605
But you don't stay very long.

15:52.072 --> 15:53.874
Dad's got lots to do, you know,

15:54.108 --> 15:55.876
I give you everything you want.

16:09.923 --> 16:11.925
All I have is you, Dad.

16:17.197 --> 16:19.199
I'm always with you,

16:20.600 --> 16:23.603
but it's not true I'm all you have,
you've got lots of friends.

16:24.771 --> 16:27.173
It's me who has just you.

16:31.277 --> 16:33.980
You're right,
we have to be together more.

16:34.180 --> 16:36.349
Go play, I'll be right there.

17:11.049 --> 17:12.450
Pretty.

17:27.798 --> 17:29.600
Want to play a little?

17:29.800 --> 17:31.402
Go ahead!

17:33.571 --> 17:35.573
I'll watch you from here.

17:42.412 --> 17:44.414
Don't get your shoes wet.

18:18.247 --> 18:19.648
Daddy!

18:38.066 --> 18:39.434
Rosario!

19:06.193 --> 19:08.195
- Ciro...
- Come in.

19:12.266 --> 19:14.235
What's wrong?

19:14.435 --> 19:16.537
Rosario's been killed.

19:16.737 --> 19:19.406
- What the fuck? When?
- Two hours ago.

19:19.606 --> 19:21.408
Who did it?

19:21.642 --> 19:23.844
- Who the fuck did it?
- I don't know.

19:24.044 --> 19:26.046
What's wrong, Dad?

19:32.853 --> 19:35.055
Uncle Rosario's been killed.

19:36.256 --> 19:38.258
Turn the neighborhood inside out

19:38.458 --> 19:41.461
and bring me the name
of my brother's killer, go!

20:26.409 --> 20:28.210
So, it's true?

20:29.078 --> 20:32.381
Yeah, he got shot right in front
of his daughter. Ciro's gone berserk.

20:32.581 --> 20:33.782
And now what?

20:33.983 --> 20:36.986
He won't rest
until he finds who did it.

20:37.186 --> 20:40.589
- If it was an Alliance guy?
- The Alliance is broken.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.560
So now they'll all be grabbing
the free dealing spots.

20:44.793 --> 20:47.763
Maybe this means it's our moment.

20:48.597 --> 20:50.999
- For what?
- For war.

21:30.170 --> 21:32.773
Tell Ciro we're collaborating,

21:32.973 --> 21:35.776
he can see for himself.

21:35.976 --> 21:38.178
The one not doing a fuck is Mulatto,

21:38.378 --> 21:41.982
he's the only one of us
with bigger reasons to shoot Dwarf

21:42.149 --> 21:45.151
and avenge his friend. Clear?

21:45.418 --> 21:49.222
Time's come to ask him
a few questions.

21:51.758 --> 21:53.159
Go!

21:53.660 --> 21:56.262
- Good evening.
- Goodbye.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.761
- Mulatto!
- What?

22:33.198 --> 22:35.200
Dwarf's dead.

22:47.412 --> 22:49.981
- Ciro wants to see you.
- I'm right here.

22:50.214 --> 22:52.817
Scianel gave your name.

22:52.984 --> 22:56.287
Tell Ciro the one pointing
is always the one shooting.

22:56.487 --> 22:59.690
Go get the champagne,
we'll have a toast.

22:59.890 --> 23:02.493
My brother Prince has been avenged.

23:12.603 --> 23:15.806
None of our men shot him.

23:16.206 --> 23:17.808
No one from around here,

23:18.008 --> 23:20.210
they acted on orders.

23:27.484 --> 23:30.086
And no one knows who gave the order.

23:31.154 --> 23:32.555
No one,

23:32.756 --> 23:35.158
Scianel and Mulatto
are slinging shit at each other.

23:45.601 --> 23:48.070
It could have been any of us.

23:53.409 --> 23:55.211
Teresa and Simonetta?

23:55.411 --> 23:57.413
They're back,

23:57.613 --> 24:00.015
they're at home with the family.

24:00.549 --> 24:01.950
Go!

24:11.993 --> 24:14.196
I like this color here.

24:14.596 --> 24:16.598
Will you use it?

25:36.542 --> 25:38.143
Let him come in.

26:04.836 --> 26:07.438
I didn't have time
to make peace with him.

26:08.840 --> 26:11.642
I can't forgive myself.

26:11.742 --> 26:14.078
I'll find him...

26:15.279 --> 26:17.081
I know what you did.

26:18.082 --> 26:19.950
I know everything.

26:20.151 --> 26:24.054
You don't know the price
for all of this.

26:25.022 --> 26:28.025
Rosario was the only one
who loved you for what you are.

26:28.759 --> 26:32.763
Now you're left alone
with your conscience.

26:35.232 --> 26:37.634
You and your little girl
have to leave.

26:38.669 --> 26:41.805
You're not safe until I find
whoever killed Rosario.

26:43.840 --> 26:46.243
Leave and keep your mouth shut,

26:46.643 --> 26:48.445
it's best for everyone.

26:54.651 --> 26:56.619
Maria Rita, let's go.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.556
Don't worry.

28:46.459 --> 28:48.861
I was choosing a photo for Rosario.

29:04.343 --> 29:06.144
Do you miss her?

29:07.045 --> 29:08.447
So much,

29:08.647 --> 29:10.849
just as you do.

29:17.322 --> 29:20.992
The lady says Mom can see everything,

29:21.226 --> 29:23.394
what is, what was and what will be.

29:23.628 --> 29:25.196
Is that true?

29:27.465 --> 29:30.234
I think the only thing
she wants to see is you.

29:38.843 --> 29:40.845
I chose this one.

30:02.599 --> 30:04.034
- Good evening, Don Ciro.
- Evening.

30:04.201 --> 30:07.003
- What's the matter?
- I need your services.

30:07.203 --> 30:09.005
At your disposal!

30:10.874 --> 30:12.642
I need a grave for a brother.

30:12.842 --> 30:14.444
No problem.

30:14.711 --> 30:16.079
Right away.

30:25.454 --> 30:26.856
Peppe!

30:33.195 --> 30:34.396
Don Amaturo!

30:36.665 --> 30:38.467
How come at this hour?

30:38.634 --> 30:41.470
A good friend died, I need a grave.

31:08.930 --> 31:11.733
- This one here.
- It's already occupied.

31:12.467 --> 31:14.635
Now and then
they come to pay respects.

31:15.169 --> 31:18.172
There's a restful place down there...

31:18.372 --> 31:21.976
No arguments,
this is my brother's grave.

31:22.643 --> 31:23.844
Get moving.

31:24.044 --> 31:26.447
No problem, Don Ciro.

31:32.719 --> 31:34.521
This one's beautiful.

33:34.704 --> 33:36.706
Do you still need us?

33:36.906 --> 33:38.908
Leave the gate open.

33:39.609 --> 33:42.011
- I want no one around.
- Okay.

33:57.927 --> 33:59.328
Yeah?

34:01.330 --> 34:03.132
I'll be right there.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.735
Wait for me, I have to be there.

34:10.893 --> 34:12.496
C'mon!

34:22.272 --> 34:23.773
Get her off me!

34:57.172 --> 34:58.774
He saved your life

34:58.974 --> 35:01.777
and you got him shot like a dog,
you piece of shit.

35:02.911 --> 35:05.113
Ciro, we have to get out of here.

35:11.653 --> 35:14.255
Call everyone
and take him to the cemetery.

35:47.721 --> 35:49.289
Outta my way.

35:58.098 --> 36:00.500
Please, have pity.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.902
- Shut up.
- Have pity!

36:03.102 --> 36:06.105
They made me do it,
then they wanted to kill me anyway.

36:07.106 --> 36:09.509
They're looking for me.

36:10.610 --> 36:12.979
Your enemies are my enemies.

36:20.119 --> 36:23.389
You took him to see his animal
because they ordered you, huh?

36:24.323 --> 36:27.293
They threatened to kill Susy.

36:28.294 --> 36:30.696
She's expecting a baby.

36:32.898 --> 36:33.999
And my brother?

36:35.867 --> 36:38.136
I don't know anything about Dwarf.

36:40.272 --> 36:43.875
First I'll fuck Susy
then bury her next to you,

36:44.075 --> 36:46.878
so you'll always be together,
you, her and your bastard kid.

36:49.114 --> 36:50.782
I don't know anything.

36:52.117 --> 36:54.385
Who ordered you to betray Prince?

37:03.694 --> 37:05.296
- Please...
- Who?

37:05.496 --> 37:07.898
Please, please...

37:09.500 --> 37:11.302
I'll tell you everything.

38:05.120 --> 38:07.890
Did you know that Prince
was buying stuff from Gennaro,

38:08.090 --> 38:09.892
outside our deal?

38:10.859 --> 38:13.462
That's where all his money came from.

38:15.097 --> 38:16.898
Rosario was right,

38:17.499 --> 38:19.401
he realized and didn't trust him.

38:21.069 --> 38:24.940
Gennaro wanted him to grow and then
turn the tables at the right time.

38:25.140 --> 38:27.742
And Dwarf didn't kill Prince,

38:28.710 --> 38:30.712
Pietro Savastano did,

38:31.045 --> 38:34.249
even knowing
he was in cahoots with his son.

38:34.482 --> 38:37.652
And Pietro Savastano's
behind Dwarf's death too.

38:37.885 --> 38:40.288
Why against his son?

38:40.488 --> 38:42.523
Because he wants to rule alone,

38:43.124 --> 38:45.092
no one else around him,
not even his son.

38:47.895 --> 38:50.297
I see just two roads now...

38:52.233 --> 38:54.235
one where we're all united

38:54.435 --> 38:57.438
and we play this game
against father and son.

39:00.474 --> 39:03.744
The other leads us
to a grave like this, all of us.

39:06.713 --> 39:08.715
We just have to decide.

39:44.884 --> 39:45.918
Get outta there.

40:35.733 --> 40:37.735
I never want to see you again.

40:38.602 --> 40:42.005
If I do,
I'll kill you and your whole family.

40:53.617 --> 40:56.419
- Thank you, Don Ciro.
- Get lost, before I change my mind.

42:25.806 --> 42:27.207
Dad...

42:30.343 --> 42:32.546
Why did you bring me here?

42:37.617 --> 42:40.020
Your mother died here.

42:44.924 --> 42:46.626
I wanted you to know.

42:47.305 --> 42:53.378
