00:19.753 --> 00:23.655
The ceremony will be carried
on all viewing screens, sir.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.657
Good.

00:25.759 --> 00:28.694
There's a call for you
from the bridge.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.166
Kirk here.

00:35.268 --> 00:37.168
[Spock]
Still no answer

00:37.270 --> 00:39.170
from Earth outpost
number 2.

00:39.272 --> 00:42.173
Now number 3
has gone silent.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.679
Maintain course
to outpost 4.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.180
Keep me informed.

00:49.282 --> 00:50.681
Kirk out.

01:21.548 --> 01:24.073
Since the days
of wooden vessels,

01:24.184 --> 01:26.584
shipmasters have had
one happy privilege--

01:26.686 --> 01:28.586
that of uniting two people

01:28.688 --> 01:30.747
in the bonds of matrimony.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.757
We are gathered here today

01:32.859 --> 01:35.589
with Angela Martine
and Robert Tomlinson

01:35.695 --> 01:38.095
in the sight of your fellows

01:38.198 --> 01:40.029
in accordance with our laws

01:40.133 --> 01:42.101
and our many beliefs--

01:42.202 --> 01:43.499
[Ship's Whistle]

01:43.603 --> 01:44.501
Alert!

01:44.604 --> 01:46.265
All decks--alert!

01:46.372 --> 01:49.102
Alert! Alert!
Captain to the bridge.

01:49.209 --> 01:50.676
Kirk here.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.610
[Spock] Earth outpost 4
reports they're under attack--

01:53.713 --> 01:55.613
a space vessel,
identity unknown.

01:55.715 --> 01:58.115
Full ahead. All decks--
condition red.

02:03.156 --> 02:05.056
All decks--condition red.

02:05.158 --> 02:08.059
All decks--condition red.

02:16.169 --> 02:17.568
Space...

02:17.670 --> 02:19.570
the final frontier.

02:19.672 --> 02:23.574
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:23.676 --> 02:25.667
Its five-year mission--

02:25.778 --> 02:29.373
to explore strange
new worlds,

02:29.482 --> 02:32.417
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

02:32.519 --> 02:36.285
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

03:09.656 --> 03:12.056
Captain's Log, stardate 1709.2.

03:12.158 --> 03:14.558
Patrolling outposts
guarding the neutral zone

03:14.661 --> 03:16.561
between planets Romulus and Remus

03:16.663 --> 03:19.461
and the rest of the galaxy,

03:19.566 --> 03:21.898
received emergency call
from outpost 4.

03:22.001 --> 03:24.765
The U.S.S. Enterprise
is moving to investigate

03:24.871 --> 03:26.338
and assist.

03:26.439 --> 03:28.839
Outpost 4 reported
under attack, sir.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.842
Then message terminates.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.844
Verified, Captain.

03:34.247 --> 03:36.647
Our speed is now maximum, sir.

03:40.853 --> 03:43.754
Position-- 8 minutes from outpost 4
at this velocity, sir.

03:46.459 --> 03:47.357
Scotty...

03:47.460 --> 03:49.860
I've talked to my engine room.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.864
We'll get more speed out of her.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.869
Did outpost 4 give anything

03:57.971 --> 03:59.871
on the attacking vessel, Lieutenant?

03:59.973 --> 04:01.463
No identification, sir.

04:01.574 --> 04:04.805
There can't be much doubt
who's attacking, sir.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.813
Mr. Spock,

04:09.916 --> 04:12.976
put this star sector
on our screen.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.259
Now show our position.

04:34.307 --> 04:36.832
Signal this to all decks,
Lieutenant.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.344
All decks standing by, sir.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.346
This is the captain speaking.

04:42.448 --> 04:43.847
In our next action,

04:43.950 --> 04:46.817
we can risk neither
miscalculation nor error

04:46.919 --> 04:48.853
by any man aboard.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.480
Listen carefully.
Science Officer.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.889
Referring to the map
on your screens,

04:53.993 --> 04:56.757
you will note beyond our vessel

04:56.863 --> 04:59.127
a line of Earth outpost stations.

04:59.232 --> 05:04.295
Constructed on asteroids, they monitor
the Neutral Zone established by treaty

05:04.404 --> 05:07.737
after the Earth-Romulan conflict
a century ago.

05:07.840 --> 05:11.401
As you may recall,
this conflict was fought,

05:11.511 --> 05:12.808
by standards today,

05:12.912 --> 05:14.812
with primitive atomic weapons

05:14.914 --> 05:16.905
and in primitive space vessels

05:17.016 --> 05:18.813
which allowed no quarter,

05:18.918 --> 05:20.317
no captives,

05:20.420 --> 05:24.083
nor was there even
ship-to-ship visual communication.

05:24.190 --> 05:28.320
Therefore, no human, Romulan, or ally

05:28.428 --> 05:30.362
has ever seen the other.

05:30.463 --> 05:33.830
Earth believes
the Romulans to be warlike,

05:33.933 --> 05:35.833
cruel, treacherous,

05:35.935 --> 05:37.835
and only the Romulans know

05:37.937 --> 05:40.064
what they think of Earth.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.233
The treaty, set by sub-space radio,

05:43.343 --> 05:45.834
established this Neutral Zone,

05:45.945 --> 05:48.345
entry into which by either side

05:48.448 --> 05:51.542
would constitute an act of war.

05:51.651 --> 05:54.848
The treaty has been
unbroken since that time.

05:54.954 --> 05:56.251
Captain.

05:57.457 --> 06:00.858
What you do not know
and must be told

06:00.960 --> 06:04.555
is that my command orders
are precise and inviolable.

06:04.664 --> 06:07.360
No provocation
will be considered

06:07.467 --> 06:09.799
sufficient reason
to violate the zone.

06:09.902 --> 06:11.631
We may defend ourselves,

06:11.738 --> 06:13.797
but, if necessary

06:13.906 --> 06:16.033
to avoid interspace war,

06:16.142 --> 06:19.111
both these outposts
and this vessel

06:19.212 --> 06:21.146
will be considered expendable.

06:21.247 --> 06:23.306
Captain out.

06:23.416 --> 06:26.317
We know outpost 4
has been attacked, sir.

06:26.419 --> 06:28.319
If we intercept Romulans now--

06:28.421 --> 06:31.822
After a century,
what will a Romulan ship look like?

06:31.924 --> 06:33.824
I doubt they'll
identify themselves.

06:33.926 --> 06:36.724
They're painted
like a giant bird of prey.

06:36.829 --> 06:39.059
Is history your specialty?

06:39.165 --> 06:40.564
Family history.

06:40.666 --> 06:43.567
A Captain Stiles
was in the space service,

06:43.669 --> 06:45.068
and several officers--

06:45.171 --> 06:47.639
all lost in that war, sir.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.640
Their war, Mr. Stiles.

06:51.944 --> 06:53.639
Not yours.

06:54.947 --> 06:56.346
Don't forget it.

06:57.450 --> 06:58.712
Yes, sir.

06:58.818 --> 07:01.810
Outpost 2 coming
into sensor range, Captain.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.754
Outpost 2
was the first to go silent?

07:04.857 --> 07:06.256
Yes, Captain.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.759
Then outpost 3 an hour later.

07:08.861 --> 07:11.261
Sweeping the area of outpost 2.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.763
Sensor reading indefinite.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.060
Double-checking outpost 3.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.932
I read dust and debris.

07:18.037 --> 07:20.562
Both Earth outposts gone,

07:20.673 --> 07:23.767
and the asteroids
they were constructed on...

07:25.378 --> 07:26.675
pulverized.

07:37.857 --> 07:40.792
Open a channel
to our nearest command base.

07:40.893 --> 07:43.794
Quarter-hour reports
on our position and status.

07:43.896 --> 07:45.090
Yes, sir.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.659
Call battle stations,
Mr. Sulu.

07:51.070 --> 07:52.628
Battle stations.

07:52.738 --> 07:54.638
All hands
to battle stations.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.139
Battle stations.

07:56.242 --> 07:59.040
Battle stations.
All decks acknowledge.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.976
All decks acknowledge, sir.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.911
All stations show green.

08:03.015 --> 08:04.414
Energize main phasers.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.485
All weapons to full power.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.486
All weapons to full power.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.283
Phaser control room.

08:10.389 --> 08:12.914
Energize. Acknowledge.

08:13.025 --> 08:14.925
Phaser control acknowledging.

08:15.027 --> 08:17.427
All weapons energizing to full.

08:19.532 --> 08:22.126
Happy wedding day... almost.

08:22.235 --> 08:25.432
You won't get off my hook
this easily.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.938
I'm going to marry you, mister,

08:28.040 --> 08:31.032
battle or phaser weapons
notwithstanding.

08:31.143 --> 08:33.236
Well, meanwhile,
temporarily at least,

08:33.346 --> 08:35.746
I am still your superior officer.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.941
So get with it, mister.

08:39.118 --> 08:40.448
Helm weapons ready.

08:40.553 --> 08:42.145
Starboard weapons ready.

08:42.255 --> 08:45.918
Acknowledged.
All weapons batteries ready.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.220
Outpost 4 now 5 minutes away.

08:48.327 --> 08:50.090
And showing on my sensors.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.959
At least it's still there.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.464
Sir, regaining contact
with outpost 4.

08:54.567 --> 08:55.966
Switching to speakers.

08:56.068 --> 08:57.467
Outpost 4...

08:57.570 --> 08:59.970
Do you read me, Enterprise?

09:00.072 --> 09:01.972
This is Commander Hansen.

09:02.074 --> 09:04.406
Kirk here.
We're minutes away, Hansen.

09:04.510 --> 09:05.909
What's your status?

09:06.012 --> 09:08.913
Outposts 2, 3, and 8 are gone.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.483
Unknown weapon.
Completely destroyed,

09:11.584 --> 09:14.382
even though we were alerted.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.887
Had our deflector shield on maximum.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.923
Hit by enormous power.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.425
First attack blew our deflector shield.

09:21.527 --> 09:23.427
If they hit us again

09:23.529 --> 09:25.429
with our deflector shield gone...

09:25.531 --> 09:27.431
Do you read me, Enterprise?

09:27.533 --> 09:29.433
Confirm what hit you, Hansen.

09:29.535 --> 09:30.934
What vessel? ldentity?

09:31.037 --> 09:34.438
Space vessel, only glimpse of.

09:34.540 --> 09:37.441
Can you locate
the intruder for us?

09:37.543 --> 09:38.567
Negative.

09:38.678 --> 09:41.203
It seems to have
disappeared somehow.

09:41.314 --> 09:45.250
I have you on my screen now.
Switching to visual.

09:45.351 --> 09:46.943
Tie us in.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.953
Tied in, sir.

10:05.371 --> 10:08.465
Enterprise, can you see it?

10:08.574 --> 10:11.975
My command post here.

10:12.078 --> 10:15.013
We're a mile deep on an asteroid.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.672
Almost solid iron.

10:16.782 --> 10:21.082
And even through our deflectors,
it did this. Can you see?

10:21.187 --> 10:22.119
Affirmative.

10:22.221 --> 10:24.314
What about the intruder?

10:24.423 --> 10:25.981
No identification.

10:26.092 --> 10:27.992
No answer to our challenge.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.119
Only a glimpse of it.

10:30.229 --> 10:32.424
Then they fired something at us--

10:32.531 --> 10:35.989
some form of high-energy plasma.

10:36.102 --> 10:38.002
Fantastic power.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.504
And then the whole vessel disappeared,

10:40.606 --> 10:42.506
but it's out there somewhere.

10:42.608 --> 10:44.838
Our sensors show that much.

10:44.944 --> 10:49.040
Enterprise, something
coming on our viewing screen.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.708
Lock us onto your screen.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.944
Switching.

10:54.053 --> 10:56.021
Can you see it, Enterprise?

10:56.122 --> 10:58.022
Can you see her?

10:58.124 --> 10:59.523
It's becoming visible

10:59.625 --> 11:01.889
in the center of my screen.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.121
Do you have phaser capacity?

11:04.230 --> 11:05.629
Negative.
Phasers gone.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.562
Weapons crew dead.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.067
Make challenge.
Warn that ship off.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.364
I'm trying, sir.
They don't acknowledge.

11:46.105 --> 11:48.505
Outpost 4...

11:50.109 --> 11:52.009
disintegrated, Captain.

11:55.114 --> 11:57.480
Position of the intruder,
Mr. Spock.

11:57.583 --> 11:58.572
Disappeared.

11:58.684 --> 12:01.016
Interesting how
they became visible briefly.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.452
When they opened fire.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.684
Perhaps necessary
when they use the weapons.

12:06.792 --> 12:10.421
A blip on the sensor.
Could be the intruder.

12:10.529 --> 12:11.962
Full magnification.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.793
Screen is on full mag.

12:16.869 --> 12:19.463
I don't see anything.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.974
Can't understand it.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.476
Invisibility is theoretically possible,
Captain--

12:26.579 --> 12:27.978
selectively bending light.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.980
But the power cost is enormous.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.982
They may have solved that.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.484
Continuing to challenge.
Still no response.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.485
Discontinue.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.987
Contact remaining outposts.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.886
Have them signal us

12:38.991 --> 12:41.789
any sightings or sensor readings
in their area.

12:41.894 --> 12:43.657
Blip has changed its heading.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.562
And in a leisurely maneuver.

12:47.666 --> 12:50.567
They may not be aware of us.

12:50.669 --> 12:53.570
Their invisibility screen
may work both ways.

12:53.672 --> 12:56.004
With that kind
of power consumption,

12:56.108 --> 12:58.906
they may not be able to see us.

12:59.011 --> 13:02.071
His heading is now 111...

13:02.181 --> 13:04.479
mark 14--

13:04.583 --> 13:06.847
The heading a Romulan would take

13:06.952 --> 13:09.443
toward the Neutral Zone...

13:09.555 --> 13:10.852
and home.

13:19.565 --> 13:20.964
Parallel course.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.795
Don't you mean
interception course?

13:22.902 --> 13:27.669
Negative. You and Mr. Sulu will
match its course and speed exactly,

13:27.773 --> 13:29.365
move for move.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.466
If he has sensors,

13:31.577 --> 13:33.977
he should think
we're a reflection,

13:34.079 --> 13:35.944
an echo.

13:36.048 --> 13:39.677
Do not enter the Neutral Zone
without direct orders.

13:39.785 --> 13:41.150
Acknowledged, sir.

13:41.253 --> 13:42.652
Cancel battle stations.

13:42.755 --> 13:44.154
All decks--
standby alert.

13:44.256 --> 13:45.655
Cancel battle stations.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.988
May I respectfully
remind the captain

13:48.093 --> 13:49.526
what has happened?

13:49.628 --> 13:52.620
Romulans have attacked our outposts,
killed our men.

13:52.731 --> 13:54.130
Mr. Stiles--

13:54.233 --> 13:56.030
It was a sneak attack.

13:56.135 --> 13:57.966
Are you questioning my orders?

13:58.070 --> 13:59.503
Negative, sir.

13:59.605 --> 14:02.301
We could have Romulan spies
aboard this ship.

14:07.112 --> 14:08.807
I agree, sir.

14:08.914 --> 14:10.939
Respectfully recommend

14:11.050 --> 14:13.450
all decks maintain
security alert.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.319
Very well.

14:16.422 --> 14:18.322
All decks--
security alert.

14:18.424 --> 14:19.891
Security alert, sir.

14:22.428 --> 14:23.918
Picking up communications.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.756
It's from their ship.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.061
Pipe it in.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.062
Sounds like code, sir.

14:34.173 --> 14:37.472
I have a fix on it, Captain.

14:37.576 --> 14:39.476
I can lock on it,

14:39.578 --> 14:41.978
get a picture of their bridge.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.072
Put it on the screen.

15:59.091 --> 15:59.989
Decoding?

16:00.092 --> 16:02.492
Cryptography
is working on it, sir.

16:02.594 --> 16:04.494
Give it to Spock.

16:04.596 --> 16:07.429
I didn't quite get that, Mr. Stiles.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.057
Repeat it.

16:09.168 --> 16:11.568
I was suggesting that Mr. Spock

16:11.670 --> 16:14.571
could probably
translate it for you, sir.

16:14.673 --> 16:17.369
I assume you're complimenting
Spock's abilities.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.376
I'm not sure, sir.

16:20.946 --> 16:23.847
Here's one thing
you can be sure of--

16:23.949 --> 16:26.349
Ieave any bigotry in your quarters.

16:26.452 --> 16:29.353
There's no room for it on the bridge.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.355
Do I make myself clear?

16:31.457 --> 16:33.357
You do, sir.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.360
Transmission has been cut off.

16:42.468 --> 16:45.869
I made a tape of it, sir.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.370
Very well.

16:52.978 --> 16:54.468
[Transmission Playing]

17:01.053 --> 17:03.385
Something visual ahead, Captain,

17:03.489 --> 17:05.047
at extreme range.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.319
He's changing course, sir.

17:11.430 --> 17:13.329
Stay with him, helm.

17:13.432 --> 17:14.830
Turning, sir.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.947
We grow visible.
Attend the cloaking system.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.949
It consumes much power, Commander.
With no enemy to concern--

17:32.051 --> 17:36.351
That Earth outpost
called to an Earth vessel.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.855
Which neither retreats
nor grows near.

17:38.957 --> 17:42.358
It is our judgment
we run from a reflection.

17:42.461 --> 17:45.362
Perhaps so, but my judgment prevails.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.374
Cloaking system on, sir.

18:02.481 --> 18:05.314
It is good we approach
the Neutral Zone.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.317
Not too soon for me

18:07.419 --> 18:10.320
to see the stars of home.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.324
I know they are following.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.326
If an Earth ship,

18:16.428 --> 18:18.828
why does he not attack?

18:21.934 --> 18:23.834
First study the enemy,

18:23.936 --> 18:25.335
seek weakness.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.337
If I were their commander,

18:27.439 --> 18:29.839
that is what I would do.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.744
My commander sent for Decius.

18:38.417 --> 18:42.012
A message was dispatched.
You've broken the rule of silence.

18:42.121 --> 18:46.217
Only to inform our praetor
of the glorious mission.

18:46.325 --> 18:51.160
Your carelessness might have ended
this glorious mission.

18:51.263 --> 18:53.823
You're reduced two steps in rank.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.874
Take care, Commander.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.173
He has friends,

19:07.279 --> 19:10.009
and friends of his kind
mean power,

19:10.115 --> 19:11.912
and power is danger.

19:12.017 --> 19:14.577
Danger and I are old companions.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.586
We've seen 100 campaigns together.

19:16.688 --> 19:18.952
Still I do not understand you.

19:20.526 --> 19:22.118
I think you do.

19:22.227 --> 19:25.822
You know what happens when we reach home
with proof of the Earthmen's weakness,

19:25.931 --> 19:27.831
and we will have proof.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.833
The Earth commander will follow.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.733
When he attacks, we will destroy him.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.636
Our gift to the homeland--
another war.

19:35.741 --> 19:39.438
If we are strong,
isn't this the signal for war?

19:39.545 --> 19:41.445
Must it always be so?

19:41.547 --> 19:43.947
How many comrades
have we lost?

19:44.049 --> 19:45.846
Our portion, Commander...

19:47.753 --> 19:49.152
is obedience.

19:49.254 --> 19:50.846
Obedience...

19:50.956 --> 19:52.355
duty.

19:52.457 --> 19:54.357
Death and more death.

19:54.459 --> 19:57.860
Soon even enough
for the praetor's taste.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.365
Centurion...

20:03.468 --> 20:05.868
I find myself
wishing for destruction

20:05.971 --> 20:07.871
before we can return.

20:13.478 --> 20:14.877
Worry not.

20:14.980 --> 20:18.882
Like you, I am
too well-trained in my duty

20:18.984 --> 20:20.383
to permit it.

20:20.485 --> 20:22.885
Continue evasive maneuvers.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.889
Now back to the first course.

20:34.499 --> 20:35.898
They're turning, sir.

20:36.001 --> 20:37.764
We're staying with them.

20:37.869 --> 20:40.394
Steady on 111, mark 14.

20:40.505 --> 20:42.905
Back on their original course, Captain,

20:43.008 --> 20:44.737
toward the Neutral Zone.

20:53.518 --> 20:55.418
What's our position, navigator?

20:57.022 --> 21:00.924
We'll enter the Neutral Zone
in less than an hour,

21:01.026 --> 21:04.860
assuming, of course,
that we don't turn back.

21:04.963 --> 21:09.366
[Scott] We now have aboard
debris from outpost 4, Captain.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.868
Bring it to the briefing room.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.370
Are you ready, gentlemen?

21:24.316 --> 21:27.376
From the outpost
protective shield--

21:27.486 --> 21:28.885
cast rodinium.

21:28.987 --> 21:30.887
This is the hardest substance

21:30.989 --> 21:33.389
known to our science.

21:37.362 --> 21:40.388
Lab theorizes
an enveloping energy plasma

21:40.499 --> 21:42.899
forcing an implosion.

21:43.001 --> 21:44.400
Comments?

21:46.271 --> 21:49.172
Obviously, their weaponry
is superior to ours,

21:49.274 --> 21:52.368
and they have a practical
invisibility screen.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.910
You're discussing tactics.

21:54.012 --> 21:56.913
Do you realize what this comes down to?

21:57.015 --> 21:59.848
Millions of lives hanging on what we do.

21:59.951 --> 22:02.442
Or on what we fail to do.

22:02.554 --> 22:03.919
The question remains.

22:04.022 --> 22:07.423
Can we engage them with
a reasonable possibility of victory?

22:07.526 --> 22:10.586
No question.
Their power is simple impulse.

22:10.696 --> 22:11.788
We can outrun them?

22:11.897 --> 22:15.264
To be used in chasing them
or retreating...sir?

22:15.367 --> 22:17.961
Go ahead.
I'm looking for opinions.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.630
- We have to attack immediately.
- Explain.

22:20.739 --> 22:22.866
They're still on our side
of the Neutral Zone.

22:22.974 --> 22:24.874
It's clear they broke the treaty.

22:24.976 --> 22:27.069
Attack without a visible target?

22:27.179 --> 22:29.477
How do we aim our phasers?

22:29.581 --> 22:31.481
Aim with sensors.
Not accurate, but--

22:31.583 --> 22:34.381
Enough for a lucky shot
before they target us?

22:34.486 --> 22:35.885
If we don't,

22:35.987 --> 22:38.888
they'll report we saw
their weapons and ran.

22:38.990 --> 22:41.982
And if they could report
they destroyed us?

22:42.094 --> 22:45.928
You run away from Romulans,
and you guarantee war.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.396
They'll be back

22:47.499 --> 22:50.059
with everything they've got.

22:50.168 --> 22:52.432
You know that, Mr. Science Officer.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.131
You've always left out that point.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.037
I'm very interested in why.

22:59.111 --> 23:00.806
Sit down, mister.

23:08.854 --> 23:10.344
I agree.

23:10.455 --> 23:11.547
Attack.

23:13.925 --> 23:17.326
Are you suggesting
we fight to prevent a fight?

23:17.429 --> 23:18.862
Based on what?

23:18.964 --> 23:20.864
Memories of an old war?

23:20.966 --> 23:24.493
On theories about a people
we've never even met?

23:24.603 --> 23:27.003
We know what they look like.

23:27.105 --> 23:28.504
Indeed we do.

23:28.607 --> 23:30.438
If Romulans are an offshoot

23:30.542 --> 23:32.373
of my Vulcan blood,

23:32.477 --> 23:35.173
then attack becomes
even more imperative.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.180
War is never imperative.

23:37.282 --> 23:39.182
It is for them, Doctor.

23:39.284 --> 23:40.683
Vulcan, like Earth,

23:40.786 --> 23:42.651
had its aggressive
colonizing period,

23:42.754 --> 23:45.279
savage even by Earth standards.

23:45.390 --> 23:48.018
If Romulans retain
this martial philosophy,

23:48.126 --> 23:50.617
then we dare not show weakness.

23:50.729 --> 23:53.095
Do you want a galactic war?

23:56.768 --> 23:58.895
Captain to bridge.

23:59.004 --> 24:00.403
This is Uhura.

24:00.505 --> 24:01.995
What's our position?

24:02.107 --> 24:04.837
Course unchanged. Estimating
treaty boundary in 21 minutes.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.843
Are you broadcasting
tactical reports?

24:06.945 --> 24:07.843
Affirmative.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.345
At this distance?

24:09.448 --> 24:11.348
Approximately three hours
before receiving

24:11.450 --> 24:13.850
a reply to our first message.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.853
Check our course ahead,
Mr. Spock.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.855
A comet, magnitude 7,

24:18.957 --> 24:20.356
dead ahead,

24:20.459 --> 24:23.860
and the intruder
changing course toward it.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.362
Comet lchyrus-4.
Composition?

24:26.465 --> 24:27.864
Quite ordinary.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.867
An ionized mass, a trail
of frozen vapor particles.

24:30.969 --> 24:34.769
And when an invisible object
passes through it...

24:34.873 --> 24:36.534
It leaves a visible trail.

24:36.641 --> 24:37.835
Ah!

24:37.943 --> 24:39.376
Our chance, gentlemen.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.879
Prepare to attack.
All hands--battle stations.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.386
I hope we won't
need your services, Bones.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.887
Amen to that.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.389
You're taking a big gamble, Jim.

25:23.822 --> 25:25.221
Battle status?

25:25.323 --> 25:27.223
All stations manned, Captain.

25:27.325 --> 25:29.225
Phaser weapons energized.

25:29.327 --> 25:31.852
Set for proximity blast.

25:31.963 --> 25:34.454
Intruder bearing directly
for comet's tail.

25:34.566 --> 25:37.000
Plot his point of entry, Stiles.

25:37.102 --> 25:39.696
Computed.
On the board, sir.

25:39.804 --> 25:42.898
When he enters the comet's tail,
he's visible.

25:43.008 --> 25:44.373
End run, gentlemen.

25:44.476 --> 25:47.468
We'll swing around
the other side

25:47.579 --> 25:49.672
and catch him at that moment.

25:49.781 --> 25:51.146
Acknowledged, Captain.

25:51.249 --> 25:53.046
He's maintaining
that bearing, Captain.

25:53.151 --> 25:55.312
Let's get him, Mr. Sulu.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.327
How pleasing to the eye it is.

26:03.428 --> 26:05.828
Behold a marvel in the darkness.

26:05.931 --> 26:08.764
You spoke of entrapment.

26:08.867 --> 26:10.767
Its many particles will obscure

26:10.869 --> 26:13.770
their sensing device, centurion.

26:13.872 --> 26:15.772
We enter it, Commander.

26:22.380 --> 26:23.779
Once fully obscured,

26:23.882 --> 26:27.511
we will turn suddenly back
upon our adversary.

26:27.619 --> 26:29.211
The screen is clear.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.221
Clear?

26:31.323 --> 26:33.154
Our reflection no
longer follows us.

26:34.893 --> 26:36.793
Escape maneuver one!
Quickly!

26:51.910 --> 26:53.810
We're losing sensor contact,
Captain.

26:53.912 --> 26:55.812
Steady as she goes.

26:55.914 --> 26:57.313
Phaser crews ready?

26:57.415 --> 26:59.315
Phaser crews signal ready, sir.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.885
He'll only be visible
for a moment.

27:03.421 --> 27:04.820
Stand by.

27:17.002 --> 27:18.560
Sir...

27:18.670 --> 27:20.262
he must have--

27:20.372 --> 27:22.067
Guessed our move.

27:22.173 --> 27:23.765
Hard to starboard, helm!

27:23.875 --> 27:25.274
Hard to starboard!

27:27.879 --> 27:30.780
He did exactly
what I would have done.

27:30.882 --> 27:33.783
I won't underestimate him again.

27:33.885 --> 27:36.786
Now, fire blind.
Lay down a pattern.

27:36.888 --> 27:38.788
Traverse pattern!
All phasers fire!

27:38.890 --> 27:40.289
Phaser one, fire!

27:40.392 --> 27:42.292
Phaser one, fire!

27:55.640 --> 27:57.301
Phaser two, fire!

27:57.409 --> 27:58.740
Phaser two, fire.

28:21.366 --> 28:24.267
Divert all power to weapons.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.777
Phaser overload.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.369
Control circuit burnout.

28:45.890 --> 28:48.154
It'll take time
to correct, sir.

28:48.259 --> 28:50.284
Captain,
are they surrendering?

28:57.402 --> 28:59.131
Full astern!

28:59.237 --> 29:00.636
Emergency warp speed!

29:07.045 --> 29:10.481
- Do we have emergency warp?
- Full power. It's still overtaking us.

29:19.357 --> 29:22.258
If we can get
one phaser working, sir,

29:22.360 --> 29:24.260
one shot would detonate it.

29:24.362 --> 29:25.590
Navigation?

29:25.697 --> 29:28.598
Estimate it will overtake us
in two minutes.

29:32.837 --> 29:34.395
Phasers, Mr. Spock?

29:34.506 --> 29:35.871
Impossible, Captain.

29:40.879 --> 29:43.780
Feed this to the space recorder
and jettison immediately.

29:45.884 --> 29:48.284
Captain, should I
continue log entry--

29:48.386 --> 29:49.284
Yeoman.

29:53.892 --> 29:55.951
Affirmative, continue log entries.

29:56.060 --> 29:57.618
Yes, sir.

29:57.729 --> 29:59.629
10 seconds to impact.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.535
Captain...

30:05.637 --> 30:07.298
It's dissipating, sir.

30:07.405 --> 30:10.135
It must have a range limit.

30:14.279 --> 30:16.179
5...

30:16.281 --> 30:17.805
4...

30:17.916 --> 30:19.850
3...

30:19.951 --> 30:20.975
2...

30:21.085 --> 30:21.983
1...

30:22.086 --> 30:22.984
impact!

30:29.928 --> 30:31.828
Limited range.

30:43.441 --> 30:44.840
Phasers operational, Captain.

30:48.947 --> 30:52.542
Intruder bearing 111, mark 14.

30:52.650 --> 30:54.709
Back to his old course.

30:54.819 --> 30:56.980
He may think we're destroyed.

30:57.088 --> 30:59.352
I wouldn't make that assumption.

30:59.457 --> 31:02.483
I don't think
their captain will, either.

31:02.594 --> 31:07.088
Intruder holding steady,
course 111, mark 14.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.430
Same as before, Mr. Sulu.

31:19.911 --> 31:21.970
Stay with him.

31:33.691 --> 31:35.659
Commander, the reflection returns.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.318
Activate our cloak.

31:37.428 --> 31:38.827
Our fuel's low!

31:38.930 --> 31:39.954
Quickly!

31:44.636 --> 31:46.831
The Earth vessel? lmpossible.

31:46.938 --> 31:48.735
It moves as we move.

31:50.942 --> 31:54.434
Its commander is not one
to repeat a mistake.

32:05.456 --> 32:08.983
We'll enter the Neutral Zone
in one minute, captain.

32:09.093 --> 32:11.288
Do we violate the treaty, Captain?

32:11.396 --> 32:12.795
They did, Doctor.

32:12.897 --> 32:17.129
Once inside, they can claim we did.
They want war, we provoke it.

32:17.235 --> 32:20.796
We're still on our side, Captain.

32:20.905 --> 32:23.806
Let's get them
before we enter the Neutral Zone.

32:23.908 --> 32:26.968
Full ahead, Mr. Sulu.
Maximum warp.

32:27.078 --> 32:29.376
Ahead, sir.
Maximum.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.572
Phasers, stand by.

32:30.682 --> 32:31.979
At this distance?

32:34.585 --> 32:37.645
We know their achilles heel,
Mr. Stiles.

32:37.755 --> 32:40.883
Their weapon takes all their energy.
They must become visible to launch it.

32:40.992 --> 32:44.189
A phaser hit at this distance
would be wild luck.

32:44.295 --> 32:47.321
I'm aware of that.
Are phasers ready?

32:47.432 --> 32:48.694
Phasers show ready.

32:51.102 --> 32:52.330
Commander!

32:52.437 --> 32:54.337
Evasive action.

32:54.439 --> 32:56.407
The Earth ship again.

33:15.293 --> 33:17.761
20 seconds to Neutral Zone, sir.

33:17.862 --> 33:19.295
Lieutenant Uhura,

33:19.397 --> 33:21.297
inform command base...

33:23.401 --> 33:25.801
In my opinion, no option.

33:27.905 --> 33:30.305
On my responsibility,

33:30.408 --> 33:33.809
we are proceeding
into the Neutral Zone.

33:38.082 --> 33:41.051
Steady as we go, Mr. Sulu.
Continue firing.

33:49.427 --> 33:51.827
Commander,
they stay within range!

33:54.432 --> 33:56.832
I will tend to the centurion.

33:56.934 --> 33:58.333
No need.

33:58.436 --> 33:59.835
Centurion is dead.

33:59.937 --> 34:02.337
Why don't we fire, Commander?

34:05.943 --> 34:07.274
No.

34:08.713 --> 34:12.774
No, he's shrewd,
this starship commander.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.784
He tries to make us waste energy.

34:15.887 --> 34:19.288
He has estimated
we have only enough...

34:26.898 --> 34:28.297
It is time.

34:28.399 --> 34:30.799
All debris into disposal tubes.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.301
Yes, Commander.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.806
The body of the centurion, too.

34:43.414 --> 34:45.813
Forgive me, my old friend,

34:45.917 --> 34:49.318
but I must use all my experience now

34:49.420 --> 34:51.320
to get home.

34:58.796 --> 35:00.696
Motion sensor signal stopped.

35:00.798 --> 35:01.992
Cease fire.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.533
Debris scatter ahead, sir.

35:03.634 --> 35:05.465
We've hit it.

35:05.570 --> 35:08.505
Vessel wreckage--
metal molds, conduit,

35:08.606 --> 35:11.268
plastaforms, and a body, Captain.

35:11.375 --> 35:12.364
However...

35:14.879 --> 35:15.971
However?

35:16.080 --> 35:17.513
Insufficient mass, sir.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.048
What?

35:19.150 --> 35:20.777
Simple debris.

35:20.885 --> 35:22.284
Not a vessel,

35:22.386 --> 35:23.683
a trick.

35:23.788 --> 35:24.914
Go to sensor probes.

35:25.022 --> 35:26.284
Nothing, sir.

35:26.390 --> 35:28.790
No motion out there at all.

35:30.394 --> 35:31.861
We've lost them, Captain.

35:44.709 --> 35:50.670
Captain's Log, Stardate 1709.6.
We are at the Neutral Zone.

35:50.781 --> 35:54.012
Have lost contact
with the intruder.

35:54.118 --> 35:56.348
No reaction
on our motion sensors,

35:56.454 --> 35:59.355
but believe the Romulan vessel
is close by

35:59.457 --> 36:02.358
with all engines and systems
shut down.

36:02.426 --> 36:06.328
The Enterprise also waits in silence
in hope of regaining contact.

36:06.430 --> 36:10.696
Captain, I must make further repairs
on the transfer coil.

36:10.801 --> 36:13.269
It's giving out again.

36:13.371 --> 36:14.770
Work quietly.

36:24.382 --> 36:26.782
Now 20 full cycles, Commander.

36:26.884 --> 36:29.284
Still no sign.

36:31.889 --> 36:33.789
I say he's been fooled.

36:33.891 --> 36:35.791
He must have gone on.

36:35.893 --> 36:38.293
Shh... he is there somewhere.

36:38.396 --> 36:40.557
I feel it.

36:40.665 --> 36:43.293
Captain's Log, supplemental.

36:43.401 --> 36:46.632
Now motionless
for 9 hours, 47 minutes.

36:56.614 --> 36:58.741
Can I get you something, sir?

37:00.785 --> 37:02.309
Coffee, at least?

37:03.421 --> 37:04.820
Thank you, Yeoman.

37:04.922 --> 37:09.256
Bring it to the bridge.
I'll be there in a moment.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.759
Yes, sir.

37:20.037 --> 37:24.269
I wish I were on
a long sea voyage somewhere.

37:24.375 --> 37:27.936
Not too much deck tennis.
No frantic dancing.

37:28.045 --> 37:30.275
No responsibility.

37:30.381 --> 37:32.781
Why me?

37:35.386 --> 37:37.286
I look around that bridge,

37:37.388 --> 37:42.291
and I see the men waiting
for me to make the next move.

37:42.393 --> 37:43.724
And, Bones...

37:46.163 --> 37:47.960
what if I'm wrong?

37:52.036 --> 37:52.968
Captain--

37:53.070 --> 37:55.766
No, I don't really
expect an answer.

37:55.873 --> 37:57.807
But I've got one.

37:57.908 --> 37:59.808
Something I seldom say

37:59.910 --> 38:03.311
to a customer, Jim.

38:05.416 --> 38:09.250
In this galaxy,
there's a mathematical probability

38:09.353 --> 38:12.254
of 3 million Earth-type planets.

38:13.858 --> 38:16.258
And in all of the universe,

38:16.360 --> 38:19.761
3 million million galaxies like this.

38:21.866 --> 38:23.766
And in all of that,

38:23.868 --> 38:26.268
and perhaps more,

38:26.370 --> 38:29.271
only one of each of us.

38:32.877 --> 38:35.277
Don't destroy the one named Kirk.

39:11.048 --> 39:13.243
[Alarm Sounds]

39:13.351 --> 39:14.613
It's all right.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.119
It's all right.

39:20.224 --> 39:22.021
A signal, Commander.

39:26.564 --> 39:28.088
We have him.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.757
Move toward him.

39:35.439 --> 39:36.770
Power on.

39:40.344 --> 39:42.278
Reverse course.
He'll try to slip under us.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.143
Lateral power.

39:44.248 --> 39:45.408
Coming around.

39:45.516 --> 39:47.643
Phasers, fire.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.786
Phasers, fire.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.802
Commander, how?

40:06.904 --> 40:08.804
He's a sorcerer, that one.

40:08.906 --> 40:11.807
He reads the thoughts in my brain.

40:13.911 --> 40:15.811
Our fuel supply all but gone,

40:15.913 --> 40:18.313
and he stays out of reach.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.815
We are beaten.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.817
Can it be true?

40:21.919 --> 40:24.820
The praetor's finest
and proudest flagship beaten!

40:27.925 --> 40:29.825
Perhaps we can yet save

40:29.927 --> 40:31.827
your praetor's pride for him.

40:31.929 --> 40:34.329
More debris into the tubes!

40:34.432 --> 40:38.334
Decius, do we have the old-style
nuclear warheads aboard?

40:38.436 --> 40:40.836
Yes, but only for self-destruction.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.838
Place one with the debris.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.339
Proximity fuse.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.342
Yes, Commander, at once.

40:50.581 --> 40:52.344
More wreckage across our path.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.610
Cease fire.

40:53.717 --> 40:55.150
Debris on our scanners.

40:55.252 --> 40:56.412
Analysis, quickly.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.044
Same as before.

40:58.155 --> 41:00.089
Except...

41:00.191 --> 41:02.625
one metal-cased object!

41:02.726 --> 41:06.389
Helm, hard over!
Phasers, fire point-blank!

41:06.497 --> 41:07.725
Phasers, fire!

41:19.210 --> 41:20.802
Glorious.

41:20.911 --> 41:22.310
Glorious.

41:25.416 --> 41:27.316
Now we go home.

41:30.421 --> 41:32.321
They're at our mercy.

41:33.924 --> 41:34.822
Commander...

41:36.427 --> 41:38.827
I remind you of your duty.

41:45.569 --> 41:47.628
- Captain to sick bay.
- McCoy here.

41:47.738 --> 41:50.366
- Casualties?
- 22 so far.

41:50.474 --> 41:54.342
Mainly radiation burns
from the ship's outer areas.

41:54.445 --> 41:56.845
Could have been much worse, Captain.

41:56.947 --> 41:58.346
Thank you, Doctor.

42:02.453 --> 42:04.216
Report, Mr. Spock?

42:04.321 --> 42:06.346
Nuclear device of some kind, sir.

42:06.457 --> 42:10.587
Our phasers detonated it
less than 100 meters away.

42:10.694 --> 42:14.027
- Ship damage?
- Mainly overloads and circuit burnouts.

42:14.131 --> 42:17.066
- Weapons status?
- We've only the forward phaser room.

42:17.167 --> 42:19.067
- Fully operable, Scotty?
- Yes, sir.

42:19.169 --> 42:22.297
But Tomlinson is manning it alone.
No standby crew available.

42:22.406 --> 42:25.307
Sir, my first assignment
was in weapons control.

42:25.409 --> 42:26.341
Go.

42:26.443 --> 42:28.809
Lieutenant Uhura,
take over navigation.

42:28.913 --> 42:30.312
Yes, Captain.

42:44.228 --> 42:48.324
We have engine power now, Captain, if
you'd like to move off and make repairs.

42:48.432 --> 42:51.333
No. Maybe we can pull them back

42:51.435 --> 42:54.336
to our side of the Neutral Zone.

42:54.438 --> 42:57.339
Hold our position.
Play dead.

43:04.448 --> 43:06.848
Still no sign of movement,
Commander.

43:06.951 --> 43:08.282
We're damaged ourselves.

43:08.385 --> 43:11.286
Our fuel reserve is gone.

43:13.390 --> 43:15.290
And it is our duty

43:15.392 --> 43:17.792
to crush the praetor's enemies.

43:18.896 --> 43:20.796
I do not trust their captain.

43:20.898 --> 43:23.298
We are in the Neutral Zone!

43:23.400 --> 43:25.300
They will not enter.

43:28.405 --> 43:29.804
If you refuse,

43:29.907 --> 43:33.308
permit me the glory
of the kill, Commander.

43:38.749 --> 43:41.309
We will attack...

43:41.418 --> 43:43.318
but on my order.

43:56.433 --> 43:58.731
Damage reports, Mr. Stiles?

43:58.836 --> 44:00.098
Negative.

44:00.204 --> 44:01.831
Will you require assistance?

44:05.976 --> 44:09.070
This time, we'll handle things
without your help, Vulcan.

44:21.091 --> 44:22.786
Tomlinson!

44:33.337 --> 44:35.396
Enemy vessel becoming visible, sir.

44:35.506 --> 44:38.669
Forward phasers, stand by.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.313
Fire!

44:45.749 --> 44:46.807
Fire!

44:48.919 --> 44:51.319
Stiles, can you hear me? Fire!

44:51.422 --> 44:52.821
Fire!

44:52.923 --> 44:55.824
Stiles, can you hear me? Fire!

44:56.927 --> 44:58.155
Fire!

44:58.262 --> 45:01.322
Stiles, can you hear me? Fire!

45:02.933 --> 45:04.332
Stiles!

45:21.385 --> 45:22.784
Weapons!

45:34.131 --> 45:38.295
Mr. Sulu, prepare to move in
on the Romulan vessel.

45:38.402 --> 45:40.302
Ship-to-ship, Uhura.

45:40.404 --> 45:42.133
Put this on the screen.

45:42.239 --> 45:43.604
Hailing frequencies open.

46:05.496 --> 46:10.263
Captain, standing by to beam
your survivors aboard our ship.

46:10.367 --> 46:12.767
Prepare to abandon your vessel.

46:14.371 --> 46:15.770
No.

46:16.874 --> 46:19.274
No, that is not our way.

46:20.878 --> 46:26.282
I regret that we meet in this way.

46:26.383 --> 46:29.784
You and I are of a kind.

46:29.887 --> 46:32.287
In a different reality,

46:32.389 --> 46:35.290
I could have called you friend.

46:35.392 --> 46:37.792
What purpose will it serve to die?

46:37.895 --> 46:41.797
We are creatures of duty, Captain.

46:42.900 --> 46:45.801
I have lived my life by it.

46:47.404 --> 46:52.569
Just one more duty to perform.

47:20.170 --> 47:22.502
- You all right, Mr. Spock?
- Yes, very well, Captain.

47:22.606 --> 47:24.574
- And you, Stiles?
- I'm alive, sir.

47:24.675 --> 47:26.768
But I wouldn't be.

47:26.877 --> 47:29.778
Mr. Spock pulled me out
of the phaser room.

47:29.880 --> 47:31.780
He saved my life.

47:31.882 --> 47:34.282
He risked his life after l--

47:34.384 --> 47:37.080
I saved a trained navigator
so he could return to duty.

47:37.187 --> 47:39.621
I am capable of no other feelings
in such matters.

47:41.892 --> 47:44.326
How many men did we lose?

47:44.428 --> 47:47.329
Only one-- Tomlinson.

47:47.431 --> 47:50.332
The boy who was getting married
this morning.

47:50.434 --> 47:52.459
His fiancee's at the chapel.

47:57.875 --> 48:01.276
We finally received
an answer from command base, sir.

48:01.378 --> 48:04.779
They'll support
