08:21.588 --> 08:24.460
ADIC Hawkins is an old friend.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.524
Great.
So, uh, the killer

08:44.567 --> 08:46.221
did not leave

08:46.264 --> 08:47.875

the ME's report.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.224
The knife wounds found
on Maria's body

08:49.267 --> 08:51.487
are similar to those found
on Merritt and Burman,

08:51.531 --> 08:53.271

08:53.315 --> 08:54.577

We're still digging

No clear nexus.

09:00.148 --> 09:02.237

a diabetes bracelet

09:12.943 --> 09:16.599

09:16.643 --> 09:18.166
No, there's nothing
about missing jewelry

09:18.209 --> 09:19.428

09:19.471 --> 09:20.821
It's not unusual

09:22.257 --> 09:24.172
Yeah, Kelly, you want

09:24.215 --> 09:25.956

- Got it.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.176
Listen, did we ever alibi out
the ex-husband?

09:28.219 --> 09:29.525
Uh, yeah.
He was in Philly overnight

09:29.569 --> 09:32.006
on a job interview.
- And we confirmed it?

09:32.049 --> 09:33.485
A theater there confirmed
he had an interview

09:33.529 --> 09:34.922
to be their technical director,

09:34.965 --> 09:37.446
and I talked to the host
at the Airbnb he stayed at.

09:37.489 --> 09:38.839
She said Owen
checked in yesterday,

09:38.882 --> 09:39.970
left early this morning.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.363
Not to mention
that he is a far cry

09:41.406 --> 09:43.147
from the daughter's
description.

09:43.191 --> 09:44.932
Okay, speaking of which,
we get an ID

09:44.975 --> 09:46.281

09:46.324 --> 09:48.500
Yes, got a list
from the Blakes' contractor.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.546
Showed the photos to Brooke
and she ID'd

09:50.590 --> 09:53.593
a man named Jeremiah Carver.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.856
All right, eyes up.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.466
What do we know about him?
- Not much.

09:57.509 --> 10:00.251
Carpenter, 32 years old,
lives in Queens.

10:00.295 --> 10:02.079
All right.
Let's bring him in.

10:02.123 --> 10:03.864
Have Tiffany and Scola
get over there.

10:03.907 --> 10:05.343
Look, I don't want
to overstep here,

10:05.387 --> 10:07.128
but your killer's been careful
every step of the way.

10:07.171 --> 10:08.390
It doesn't make
sense for him to attack

10:08.433 --> 10:09.478
someone he's been working for.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.872
We just had
a witness ID him.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.264
Yes, but cross-racial
identifications

10:13.308 --> 10:14.614
are less reliable,
and the witness is

10:14.657 --> 10:15.876
a ten-year-old who saw him

10:15.919 --> 10:17.312
from across the room
in the dark.

10:17.355 --> 10:20.620
I understand, but right now,
it's all we have.

10:24.406 --> 10:27.496
I'm not seeing him anywhere.
We sure he's still here?

10:27.539 --> 10:29.890
Carver charged his card here
less than ten minutes ago,

10:29.933 --> 10:31.021
and his crew says
he hasn't been

10:31.065 --> 10:32.544

10:34.938 --> 10:36.636
Heads up.

10:36.679 --> 10:39.334

Accused me of dealing weed
out of the house.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.332
Based on the stash we found,
I'm assuming

12:04.375 --> 12:06.334

Weed's legal in New York.

Mm.

Has anyone recovered that?
- No, not yet.

14:13.678 --> 14:15.376
Huh.
He must have took it with him

14:33.916 --> 14:35.178
Well, a security camera
caught the killer

14:35.222 --> 14:36.658
breaking
into the victim's house,

14:36.701 --> 14:38.660
but he managed to avoid
the street cams in the area,

14:38.703 --> 14:40.575
so that means
he did his homework.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.142
He scoped the area out.

14:42.185 --> 14:43.621
So we're checking for video
earlier in the day,

14:43.665 --> 14:46.146

Anything that connects
Zoffer to the others?

14:47.712 --> 14:49.192
I mean, there's--
there's some overlap

14:49.236 --> 14:50.541
with Merritt and Burman,

14:50.585 --> 14:52.152
but most of that
can be chalked up

14:52.195 --> 14:53.327
to living
in the same neighborhood.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.198
The nexus may be
the women's success.

14:55.242 --> 14:57.157
Killer's resentful,
attacks powerful women

14:57.200 --> 14:59.159

14:59.202 --> 15:00.421
Right, all right,
so let's chase that.

15:00.464 --> 15:01.857
That would mean the killer is

15:01.901 --> 15:04.338
underemployed or unemployed,
someone on the fringe.

15:04.381 --> 15:05.426
Yeah, sounds right.

15:05.469 --> 15:06.862
Someone bitter, disenfranchised.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.169
Statistically, it's probably
a blue-collar worker.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.344
Right, well, that--
that tracks

15:10.387 --> 15:11.823
with the print
we found at the scene,

15:11.867 --> 15:14.174
size 11 Starks--
common work boot.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.479
- Jubal.
- Yeah?

15:15.523 --> 15:16.741
- We got something.
- Lab ID'd the fragments

15:16.785 --> 15:18.700
in the boot--
it's stained glass.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.267
Any stained glass found
at Zoffer's house?

15:20.310 --> 15:22.443
No, we think that the killer
must have tracked it in.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.706
- Probably from a church.
- Right, good.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.316
So let's get
boots on the ground.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.188

any and all churches

15:28.231 --> 15:29.276

15:29.319 --> 15:30.712
And schedule
a press conference.

15:30.755 --> 15:31.887
I want to get
this guy's face out there.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.236
Somebody knows who he is

15:33.280 --> 15:34.629
or has seen him loiter
in the neighborhood.

15:34.672 --> 15:35.673
Yes, ma'am.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.373
Isobel, wait.

15:39.416 --> 15:41.288
I don't think
this is a good idea.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.290
- Excuse me?
- Holding a press conference,

15:43.333 --> 15:44.813
blasting his face
out to the community--

15:44.856 --> 15:46.641
I'm not sure
the person we see on camera

15:46.684 --> 15:48.556
is the killer.
Something isn't adding up.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.601
We have video
of him breaking in.

15:50.645 --> 15:51.820
I know, I saw it.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.213
But from
a statistical standpoint,

15:53.256 --> 15:54.997
there are very few
Black serial killers,

15:55.041 --> 15:56.738
and the ones we do know about
typically target

15:56.781 --> 15:59.567
disenfranchised,
low-income victims.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.743
We have video of him
at various crime scenes.

16:01.786 --> 16:02.918
We can see his face.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.746
He's Black.
- I know.

16:04.789 --> 16:05.877
Doesn't make sense
to me either.

16:05.921 --> 16:07.270
But I think it's prudent
to hold off

16:07.314 --> 16:08.924
on releasing a photo.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.405
This guy kills
in order to feel powerful.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.015
You give him
more media attention,

16:13.059 --> 16:14.451
you're giving him more power.

16:14.495 --> 16:15.844
You could trigger him
to strike again.

16:15.887 --> 16:17.454
He has killed
two nights in a row.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.413
He's gonna strike again regardless.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.589

What is the alternative then?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.826
We wait for him
to kill another woman,

16:41.870 --> 16:45.613
hope he makes a mistake
that we can capitalize on?

If there is any chance
someone can identify

20:58.344 --> 20:59.910
Kelly, how we coming?

20:59.954 --> 21:01.912
NYPD's five minutes away,

21:01.956 --> 21:03.610
OA and Nina
another ten behind them.

21:03.653 --> 21:05.742
Okay, I'm heading over there.
Elise?

21:05.786 --> 21:07.266
Keep trying her.

21:24.761 --> 21:26.197
Jubal?

21:26.241 --> 21:28.112
Isobel, thank God.

21:28.156 --> 21:29.592
Hey, just saw
I missed your calls.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.290
What's going on?
- Listen to me.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.595
The perp has your address.

21:32.639 --> 21:34.118
You might be the next target.

21:34.162 --> 21:35.859
What?
That doesn't make any sense.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.600
He'd have to be--
- No, you--you fit the profile.

21:37.644 --> 21:40.647
He saw your press conference
or read about it.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.257
Now, listen to me,
agents and cops are on the way,

21:42.301 --> 21:45.956
but you need to get
out of the house right now.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.658
Jubal, hang on.
I hear something.

21:51.701 --> 21:58.708
<i>♪</i>

22:01.232 --> 22:03.844
Jubal, I have to go. He's here.

22:03.887 --> 22:06.934
All right,
keep me on the phone.

22:09.153 --> 22:12.069
Isobel? Isobel?

22:12.113 --> 22:19.033
<i>♪</i>

24:00.787 --> 24:03.267
I lost him.

24:03.311 --> 24:05.835
Hey, have your units
seal off this block.

24:05.879 --> 24:08.272
I don't want anybody in or out.

24:08.316 --> 24:11.101
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

24:11.145 --> 24:12.320
Good.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.758
What do you mean
his face was a mask?

24:15.802 --> 24:19.849
It--it was silicone.
It--it was hyper-realistic.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.764
Even in the same room,
I couldn't tell it was fake

24:21.808 --> 24:23.462
until I actually felt it.

24:23.505 --> 24:25.115
So those photos
that we have--

24:25.159 --> 24:26.943
They don't tell
the whole story.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.902
Did you get a look
at the guy's real face?

24:28.945 --> 24:32.427
No, but I saw his skin.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.038
He was white.

24:35.082 --> 24:37.780
I should--I should have
never released those photos.

24:37.824 --> 24:40.522
I just told the public
to be on alert for a Black man

24:40.566 --> 24:43.307
who is actually white.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.005
We all saw that video, Isobel.

24:45.048 --> 24:46.963
No, I moved too quickly.

24:47.007 --> 24:49.226
Marshall warned us
that something was off,

24:49.270 --> 24:50.793
and--and this--
this guy set us up

24:50.837 --> 24:53.535
to look for a Black killer,
and I took that bait.

24:53.579 --> 24:57.452
Hey, don't do that.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.802
We'll--we'll put out
a press release.

24:59.846 --> 25:01.325
We'll correct
the killer's description.

25:01.369 --> 25:03.937
But that press conference--
that led us to the church,

25:03.980 --> 25:05.286
which gave us evidence.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.291
You should take a few days.

25:10.334 --> 25:11.988
You rest up. We'll handle this.

25:12.032 --> 25:14.295
- No, I'm good.
- Isobel.

25:14.338 --> 25:16.297
You were attacked
in your own home.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.559
I am fine.

25:17.603 --> 25:18.865
Let's get back to the JOC,

25:18.908 --> 25:21.998
and let's catch
this son of a bitch.

25:25.088 --> 25:26.873
Yeah, and that's
gotta give us something.

25:26.916 --> 25:29.919
Kelly, any leads
on the, uh--the mask?

25:29.963 --> 25:31.051
Not yet.

25:31.094 --> 25:32.226
There are six companies
in New York

25:32.269 --> 25:34.054
that carry
these hyper-realistic masks,

25:34.097 --> 25:35.403
another 30 or so nationwide.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.100
I've sent our perp's photo
around to all of them,

25:37.144 --> 25:38.928
but so far--
- Okay, keep digging.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.408
You know, the fact
that he was wearing

25:40.451 --> 25:43.019
a Black mask might give us
some insight to who he is.

25:43.063 --> 25:44.847
We think this is
racially motivated?

25:44.891 --> 25:46.849
Unlikely.
He seems to be choosing targets

25:46.893 --> 25:48.459
based on gender and career.

25:48.503 --> 25:51.027
Or maybe the mask
is just meant to be

25:51.071 --> 25:52.507
a good disguise.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.336
Gets caught on camera,
hard to identify the suspect.

25:55.379 --> 25:56.859
And the cherry on top
is that he can use

25:56.903 --> 25:58.600
the old "the Black guy did it"
to get away with murder.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.123
Right.
Hey, Elise,

26:00.167 --> 26:01.211
we getting anywhere
with that journal?

26:01.255 --> 26:02.604
Well, he's thorough.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.388
He cased the buildings,
took notes on the layouts,

26:04.432 --> 26:05.520
victims' schedules.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.391
Any idea
how he got my address?

26:07.435 --> 26:10.046
Yeah, he has
your train route in here.

26:10.090 --> 26:11.526
Looks like he followed you
from the office

26:11.570 --> 26:13.397
to get the address,
circled back after dark.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.878
I mean, this much stalking
means a lot of exposure.

26:15.922 --> 26:18.881
Kelly, uh, let's make sure
we track Isobel's movements

26:18.925 --> 26:20.187
after leaving work.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.102
We need to find
this guy on camera

26:22.145 --> 26:24.060
without a mask on.
- Copy that.

26:24.104 --> 26:25.322
Can I see that one?

26:30.458 --> 26:32.895
- You got something?
- He's classifying them.

26:32.939 --> 26:35.419
"Chetna Burman, PX,"
"Jamie Merritt, PPX."

26:35.463 --> 26:37.247
That's restaurant code for VIP.

26:37.291 --> 26:41.077
PX means important,
PPX means very important.

26:41.121 --> 26:42.426
Dated a waitress in college.

26:42.470 --> 26:43.645
So if that's
how he's labelling them,

26:43.689 --> 26:45.212
he has to work at a restaurant,

26:45.255 --> 26:46.517
or have worked at a restaurant,

26:46.561 --> 26:47.910
where all three of them
have been.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.477
Uh, Kelly,
you're charting overlap

26:49.520 --> 26:51.044
between the victims, right?
- Uh, yes, but there wasn't

26:51.087 --> 26:53.002
anything that applied
to all six of them.

26:53.046 --> 26:54.264
Uh-huh.

26:54.308 --> 26:55.439
Well, maybe it's not
that straightforward.

26:55.483 --> 26:58.051
We know Isobel was off-pattern.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.313
And maybe the Blakes
were too.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.228
There's no PX
next to their names in here.

27:01.271 --> 27:02.533
Oh, okay, so let's focus

27:02.577 --> 27:04.535
on just the Upper West Side
victims for now,

27:04.579 --> 27:06.233
Merritt, Burman, Zoffer.

27:06.276 --> 27:09.671
Anywhere all three of them
have been?

27:09.715 --> 27:11.194
Yeah, a few places.

27:11.238 --> 27:14.284
Uh, an organic market
on 87th Street, Dave's Coffee.

27:14.328 --> 27:15.329
No, you're looking

27:15.372 --> 27:16.591
for a high-end restaurant, Kelly.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.158
Place that's hard to get into.

27:18.201 --> 27:20.551
Okay.

27:20.595 --> 27:22.945
Antonia's? West 72nd Street.

27:27.123 --> 27:28.559
These are
the only four staff members

27:28.603 --> 27:30.997
who worked all three nights
that the women were here.

27:31.040 --> 27:34.391
Uh, our hostess, Anne,
our bartender, Lena,

27:34.435 --> 27:36.306
and two
of our waitstaff members,

27:36.350 --> 27:37.699
Kaitlin and Deshawn.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.048
I need you to think.
Are you sure

27:39.092 --> 27:40.354
these are the only people
who could be aware

27:40.397 --> 27:42.095
of their VIP status?

27:42.138 --> 27:44.140
Um, our reservationists,
I guess.

27:44.184 --> 27:48.101
Um, Tracy and--
- David Owen.

27:48.144 --> 27:49.537
That's Olivia Blake's
ex-husband.

27:52.627 --> 27:54.498
Let's go.

28:01.027 --> 28:02.028
All right, people,

28:02.071 --> 28:03.072
what do we know
about David Owen?

28:03.116 --> 28:04.334
Let's turn over some stones.

28:04.378 --> 28:06.162
If he cheated
on a test in middle school,

28:06.206 --> 28:07.686
I want to know about it.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.513
I thought we confirmed
that Owen was in Philadelphia

28:09.557 --> 28:10.558
the night of the Blake attack?

28:10.601 --> 28:11.690
Well, we confirmed the trip,

28:11.733 --> 28:13.300
but Philly's
less than two hours away.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.128
He could have driven back
in the middle of the night.

28:15.171 --> 28:16.520
And he had us looking
for a Black suspect

28:16.564 --> 28:17.521
with the mask.

28:17.565 --> 28:18.871
He couldn't wait
for his daughter

28:18.914 --> 28:21.003
to tell us she'd seen
the construction worker,

28:21.047 --> 28:22.613
Carver.
- So where's his daughter now?

28:22.657 --> 28:23.658
With her maternal grandparents.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.703
We already called.
They started her

28:24.746 --> 28:26.661
back at school this morning.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.532
Yeah, uh,
looks like Owen worked

28:28.576 --> 28:30.317
as a technical director
at an off-Broadway theater

28:30.360 --> 28:31.622
for several years.

28:31.666 --> 28:33.494
That explains how he had
access to the masks.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.539
But he lost his job
during the shutdown,

28:35.583 --> 28:37.541
started working at Antonia's.

28:37.585 --> 28:40.327
Then Olivia divorced him,
started dating Maria.

28:40.370 --> 28:44.374
They got married on March 20th.

28:44.418 --> 28:46.289
That's the night
Chetna Burman was killed.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.378
The marriage set him off.

28:48.422 --> 28:50.598
To David, these women
tore his family apart.

28:50.641 --> 28:52.774
He starts going after targets
with similar profiles.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.558
And there's no shortage
of powerful women

28:54.602 --> 28:56.778
coming through
the hottest restaurant in town.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.214
All right, where is he now?

28:58.258 --> 28:59.520
Uh, not sure.

28:59.563 --> 29:00.826
Manager said he didn't come
into work today.

29:00.869 --> 29:04.177
But they have
an address on file.

29:04.220 --> 29:07.267
Washington Heights.
400 West 171st Street.

29:07.310 --> 29:09.704
Get Tiffany and Scola
over there now.

We're all clear.

was trying

29:30.899 --> 29:32.727
to get out of here in a hurry.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.338
I'll take the kitchen.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.854
Think I found
our Black suspect.

30:12.898 --> 30:17.728
Also, it seems
our trophy theory was correct.

30:17.772 --> 30:19.861
- Nice.
- What's that?

30:19.905 --> 30:22.603
Uh, MetroCard receipt.
Found it in the trash.

30:22.646 --> 30:24.779
Bought with cash last week.

30:29.871 --> 30:31.438
Okay, looks like
Owen got on the subway

30:31.481 --> 30:32.831
at the Bedford/Nostrand stop.

30:32.874 --> 30:35.442
- Any idea where he got off?
- Uh, not yet.

30:35.485 --> 30:36.878
But there's good
camera coverage down there.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.314
I got him.

30:38.358 --> 30:39.707
This is 20 minutes ago
near the 7th Avenue stop

30:39.750 --> 30:41.013
in Park Slope.

30:41.056 --> 30:43.406
Okay, can we track
where he went from there?

30:43.450 --> 30:44.494
No, he hits
a dead zone outside

30:44.538 --> 30:45.495
and we lose him again.

30:45.539 --> 30:46.975
Okay, so what's
in that area?

30:47.019 --> 30:48.585
Well, the Blakes' house is
a block away from there.

30:48.629 --> 30:49.717
Yeah, but why would he go
back to the house

30:49.760 --> 30:52.241
if his ex is still
in the hospital?

30:52.285 --> 30:53.939
Where does his daughter
go to school?

30:53.982 --> 30:57.246
Middleton Elementary,
which is...

30:57.290 --> 30:58.900
two blocks from there.

30:58.944 --> 31:01.424
He clearly cares about her.
Spared her in the attack.

31:01.468 --> 31:02.861
If he got spooked

31:02.904 --> 31:04.601
by what happened at your house
and he's running...

31:04.645 --> 31:07.735
Maybe he's taking her
with him.

31:07.778 --> 31:09.258
I didn't know what to do.

31:09.302 --> 31:11.391
It's not your fault.
Everything's gonna be okay.

31:11.434 --> 31:13.784
Agents Zidan and Chase, FBI.
What's going on?

31:13.828 --> 31:14.916
Possible abduction.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.439
One of the parents came in

31:16.483 --> 31:17.963
and pulled the kid
out of class.

31:18.006 --> 31:20.008
- Was the student Brooke Owen?
- Yes.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.880
Okay, we can take it
from here.

31:24.621 --> 31:26.928
- I--I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

31:26.972 --> 31:29.757
It's okay. Breathe, okay?
Tell us what happened.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.629
I was in the middle
of a lesson,

31:32.673 --> 31:35.719
and Brooke's father barged in,
told her to get her stuff.

31:35.763 --> 31:38.635
He--he looked really off,
almost deranged.

31:38.679 --> 31:40.289
Did he say
where he was taking her?

31:40.333 --> 31:41.421
No.

31:41.464 --> 31:42.813
Just that it was
a family emergency.

31:42.857 --> 31:43.902
I tried to tell him

31:43.945 --> 31:45.425
that he couldn't
just take Brooke

31:45.468 --> 31:47.949
out of class like that,
but, uh, he flashed a knife.

31:47.993 --> 31:51.474
And I--I had
20 other kids in the class.

31:51.518 --> 31:53.563
I--I just let him take her.

31:53.607 --> 31:55.957
- Okay, when was this?
- About ten minutes ago.

31:56.001 --> 31:57.916
- Which way did they go?
- I don't know.

31:57.959 --> 31:59.613
I--I'm sorry.
It all happened so fast.

31:59.656 --> 32:00.831
I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

32:00.875 --> 32:01.876
It's all right.
We're gonna need to see

32:01.920 --> 32:03.008
the school's
security footage ASAP.

32:03.051 --> 32:04.879
- Okay.
- I'm so sorry.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.054
You did the right thing.

32:09.579 --> 32:11.059
All right, so David Owen
kidnapped his daughter

Can we get a license plate?

32:17.718 --> 32:19.981
Not from this angle.
Hang on.

32:27.989 --> 32:29.469
It's the hospital.

It's registered
to Owen's ex-wife,

32:30.861 --> 32:32.863

- Does it have GPS?

32:32.907 --> 32:34.430
No, it's an older model.

32:34.474 --> 32:36.606

the last time you spoke

33:01.849 --> 33:03.372

33:03.416 --> 33:04.765
Just a few days ago.

33:04.808 --> 33:06.549
Okay, did he mention
anything unusual?

33:06.593 --> 33:08.116
Anything that might indicate
what he was planning?

33:08.160 --> 33:11.728
No--no, he--

33:11.772 --> 33:14.601
I mean, he was upset.

33:17.038 --> 33:19.040
He had an interview
in Philadelphia.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.650
He wanted Brooke to move there.

33:20.694 --> 33:22.783
I told him
that was never gonna happen.

33:22.826 --> 33:24.567
But he didn't argue.

33:24.611 --> 33:26.047
He just said,

33:26.091 --> 33:27.440
"I'm sorry you feel that way,"

33:27.483 --> 33:31.096
and hung up.
I thought he'd accepted it.

33:31.139 --> 33:33.750
