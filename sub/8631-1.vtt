You're kneeling on
my air tube, asshole.

10:19.542 --> 10:21.208
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

10:21.291 --> 10:23.125
I got it.
I... I'm so sorry.

10:23.208 --> 10:24.542
I got it now.
I got...

10:24.625 --> 10:26.083
(AIR HISSING)

10:27.000 --> 10:28.834
I got it.
This thing's slippery.

10:28.917 --> 10:30.333
(CHUCKLES)

10:30.417 --> 10:32.375
(EXCLAIMING)

10:34.417 --> 10:35.750
(GROANING)

10:36.750 --> 10:38.417
Come on, Pops,
this is ridiculous.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.583
Look at him.

10:39.667 --> 10:41.250
He should be
wearing a helmet.

10:41.333 --> 10:42.458
POPS: Corky...

10:42.542 --> 10:43.583
Come here.

10:47.375 --> 10:50.041
I'm not going to lie
to you anymore.

10:51.542 --> 10:53.917
I'm not a landscaper.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.750
I don't know what
you're talking about.

10:55.834 --> 10:58.291
Get your head out of
the sand, shit for brains.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.625
How many landscapers
you know

10:59.709 --> 11:02.291
get paid in briefcases
full of cash, huh?

11:02.375 --> 11:05.291
Oh, you... You do do some
landscaping though, right?

11:05.375 --> 11:07.792
I dabble in money
laundering, gambling,

11:07.875 --> 11:09.875
and the occasional
landscaping.

11:11.917 --> 11:13.166
Now, look, Son,

11:13.250 --> 11:14.500
I know you're not
comfortable

11:14.583 --> 11:15.792
with the family
business,

11:15.875 --> 11:17.333
but we don't have
much time.

11:17.417 --> 11:19.458
I want you
to go undercover

11:19.542 --> 11:21.875
as an FBI agent

11:21.959 --> 11:25.041
and destroy the evidence
against me.

11:25.959 --> 11:28.542
(LAUGHS)

11:28.625 --> 11:31.375
But I have animals
that depend on me.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.375
We'll send someone
to fill in for you.

11:36.625 --> 11:38.834
Do you really think
I'm the most qualified?
I mean...

11:38.917 --> 11:40.500
The consensus is

11:40.583 --> 11:42.834
that you're
the least qualified,

11:42.917 --> 11:44.417
but you're family.

11:45.542 --> 11:47.166
Could I, uh...

11:47.250 --> 11:49.834
Could I... Could I...
Could I think about this?

11:49.917 --> 11:51.542
What's to
think about, Corky?

11:51.625 --> 11:53.166
Can't you see Pops
swallowed his pride

11:53.250 --> 11:54.375
just asking you
to do this?

11:54.458 --> 11:55.834
When's the last time
you lifted a finger

11:55.917 --> 11:57.000
for this family?

11:57.083 --> 11:58.417
It's just all...
You know...

11:58.500 --> 12:01.709
It's all happening
so fast.

12:01.792 --> 12:02.959
Wait, wait.

12:03.917 --> 12:05.125
Let me talk to him.

12:09.291 --> 12:10.709
Look, kid,

12:10.792 --> 12:13.875
think of this as
your chance to make amends.

12:13.959 --> 12:15.208
You know you broke
your pop's heart

12:15.291 --> 12:16.375
when you turned
your back

12:16.458 --> 12:17.875
on the family business.

12:17.959 --> 12:19.333
I didn't turn my back.

12:19.417 --> 12:20.917
They kicked me out
after Mom died.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.083
Irregardless,
what matters now

12:23.166 --> 12:24.500
is your family
needs you.

12:24.583 --> 12:25.625
What do you say, kid?

12:34.667 --> 12:36.750
Paulie, you get another
DUI you need fixed?

12:36.834 --> 12:39.375
No, I need you to send
something to the FBI.
Can you handle that?

12:39.458 --> 12:40.709
DEXTER: Peter,
look who you're talking to.

12:40.792 --> 12:42.917
I got
a 120-gig hard drive

12:43.000 --> 12:45.583
and a digital connection
NASA would envy.

12:45.667 --> 12:46.709
Whoa!

12:46.792 --> 12:47.875
Is that one
of those Epsons

12:47.959 --> 12:49.375
you can print
greeting cards on?

12:49.458 --> 12:50.583
Shut up, Corky.

12:50.667 --> 12:53.792
Okay, tell me exactly
what you need.

12:53.875 --> 12:56.583
I need you to plant
Corky here with the FBI
station in Park Realm.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.917
Need you to set him up
with a fake background,
fake name and a resume.

12:59.000 --> 12:59.959
And it better be
a good one,

13:00.041 --> 13:01.291
because if they don't
accept his transfer,

13:01.375 --> 13:02.583
I'm personally
going to download

13:02.667 --> 13:04.583
500 megabytes
of my fist up your ass.

13:04.667 --> 13:05.750
CORKY: Uh...

13:05.834 --> 13:07.750
Technically,
you'd be uploading that.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.583
But, you know, not
that I'm a computer whiz

13:09.667 --> 13:11.291
or anything,
because I'm not.
I'm not...

13:11.375 --> 13:12.542
Just do the right thing,
Dexter.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.125
I don't want
to have to kill you.

13:14.208 --> 13:15.250
CORKY: Come on.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.500
Let's settle down, huh?

13:17.583 --> 13:19.917
All right. All right.
What should his name be?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.792
I really don't care
what you call him, Pissant.

13:21.875 --> 13:23.041
Come on, guys.

13:26.375 --> 13:27.375
CORKY:
For my resume,

13:28.417 --> 13:29.834
I'm very good
with animals.

13:30.417 --> 13:32.500
Thanks.

13:32.583 --> 13:33.959
If you're going to keep
hanging out with us,

13:34.041 --> 13:35.792
could you at least
try and carry yourself

13:35.875 --> 13:37.291
a little bit
more like us, please?

13:37.375 --> 13:39.125
Oh, you mean
with unmitigated rage

13:39.208 --> 13:40.250
and violence?

13:40.333 --> 13:42.250
Look, stop trying to talk
like Mom, all right?

13:42.333 --> 13:43.583
You're too soft.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.333
You complimented that guy
on his equipment,

13:45.417 --> 13:46.959
and then you thanked him
for his time.

13:47.041 --> 13:48.417
I mean, Christ, Corky,
you might as well give him

13:48.500 --> 13:50.291
a glass of wine
and a handshake.

13:50.375 --> 13:51.625
Are you guys familiar
with the expression

13:51.709 --> 13:53.750
"You catch more bees
with honey than vinegar"?

13:53.834 --> 13:55.125
You know that one.

13:55.208 --> 13:57.041
Ow! Ow! Ouch!

13:57.125 --> 13:58.709
What is your problem?

13:58.792 --> 14:00.375
Paulie, where the hell
is this place?

14:00.458 --> 14:01.500
I don't know.
CORKY: What place?

14:01.583 --> 14:02.625
The motel.

14:02.709 --> 14:03.709
But I thought I was staying
in the house

14:03.792 --> 14:04.875
in my old room.

14:04.959 --> 14:06.208
You can't stay
in the house.

14:06.291 --> 14:07.333
CORKY: Why not?

14:07.417 --> 14:08.709
Well, a couple
of reasons.

14:08.792 --> 14:10.834
Number one, the house
is under surveillance.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.834
Number two, we turned
your old room into a gym

14:12.917 --> 14:14.083
and threw out
all your shit.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.000
I thought I was going to...

14:17.083 --> 14:18.166
God, what is...

14:18.250 --> 14:20.542
Why did...
Why did you do that?

14:20.625 --> 14:22.291
Shut up.
Listen to your brother.

14:38.166 --> 14:39.625
All right,
pull down your pants.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.208
No.

14:41.291 --> 14:42.709
Corky, I'm not going
to give you a wedgie.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.542
I'm going to put
a wire on you.

14:44.625 --> 14:45.583
It's Uncle Leo's idea,

14:45.667 --> 14:46.458
in case you get in
over your head in there.

14:46.542 --> 14:48.250
Let's go.
Pull down your pants.

14:49.291 --> 14:50.333
Let's go.

14:57.750 --> 14:58.792
(LAUGHS)

14:59.500 --> 15:01.000
Hey.
Come on! Come on!

15:01.083 --> 15:02.667
(LAUGHS)
Stop that.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.166
Knock it off!

15:04.250 --> 15:05.583
Okay. I'm sorry.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.166
Move your hands.

15:14.792 --> 15:16.041
(ZIPS UP PANTS)
Ow! Ow! Ow!

15:16.125 --> 15:17.458
All right, give me
a sound check.

because I didn't want to go,

15:52.375 --> 15:54.041
but at the end
of the summer,

17:28.500 --> 17:30.542
You can go now, Agent.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.417
(WHISPERS) I will go now.
Thank you.

17:35.583 --> 17:36.834
Excuse me.

17:36.917 --> 17:39.417
I had a small confrontation
at the checkpoint,

came through

Night Vulture?

18:14.875 --> 18:16.542
SHUSTER: Number six

18:16.625 --> 18:18.625
The biggest heroin supplier
on the east coast,

18:18.709 --> 18:20.750
not to mention
the most sadistic.

The last four guys
that pissed him off

18:25.667 --> 18:27.041
I asked the coroner
about the weapon.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.417
He says there was none.

That's just one down.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.125
By the time I'm finished,

18:58.208 --> 18:59.750
the whole family
will be in jail.

for bravery,

19:06.375 --> 19:08.333

for sharpshooting

19:08.417 --> 19:10.083

Thank you.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.500
It should give

19:29.583 --> 19:31.083

five different languages.

19:59.917 --> 20:01.000
I'm an expert sharpshooter.

went a little crazy.

20:07.250 --> 20:09.166
Ah, none of this shit
matters.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.333
Just go in there
and get the evidence.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.375
Then you can go back
to giving hamsters enemas

20:12.458 --> 20:13.542

you do.

20:35.625 --> 20:36.667
Come here...

20:39.291 --> 20:41.208
All right, forget about it,
Paulie. This is pointless.

20:41.291 --> 20:42.500
You know what?
We're going to have to have

20:42.583 --> 20:44.208
an ambulance standing by

20:44.291 --> 20:46.333
for when we break
the news to Papa.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.333
Okay. I'll do it.

20:53.625 --> 20:55.125

54:29.667 --> 54:30.917
I sponsor
one of the girls,

54:31.000 --> 54:32.375

I realized no one's
gonna just hand me

54:39.333 --> 54:40.917

so I made Shuster

54:41.000 --> 54:43.208
send me in here
to collect more evidence.

54:43.291 --> 54:46.083
What about you?
I'm... Undercover, too.

54:47.792 --> 54:49.125
That is so typical!

54:49.208 --> 54:51.917
Shuster gave me his word
that he wouldn't
send a man to cover me.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.750
No, I... I was
just here first.
That's why I'm here now.

54:54.834 --> 54:56.083
How come Shuster
didn't say anything?

54:56.166 --> 54:57.458
He doesn't know.

54:57.542 --> 54:59.792
You're undercover without
clearance or backup?
That's insane!

It's crazy, isn't it?

55:01.750 --> 55:04.750

to be different.

of my left lapel,

01:04:07.625 --> 01:04:09.500
just to see
if you'd notice.

01:04:09.583 --> 01:04:13.834
Did you notice?
No. I got nothin'.

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:16.000
I'm sorry. Maybe I was
a little bit busy.

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:18.500
Yeah! Talkin' about
how great Pissant is!

01:04:18.583 --> 01:04:20.000
(DOOR OPENS)

01:04:20.083 --> 01:04:21.458
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

01:04:21.542 --> 01:04:23.667
Hey, Howard.
You wanted
to see us?

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.125
Howard?

01:04:25.208 --> 01:04:26.792
What happened to "sir"?

01:04:26.875 --> 01:04:28.625
It's "Mr. Shuster."

01:04:28.709 --> 01:04:32.000
And what is with
those ridiculous ties?

01:04:32.083 --> 01:04:34.709
It's this jiggling little
fruitcake, isn't it?

01:04:34.792 --> 01:04:36.375
Christ! Relax, Brick.

01:04:36.458 --> 01:04:37.834
It's Agent Davis.

01:04:37.917 --> 01:04:38.875
SHUSTER: He's right.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.291
Relax, Brick.

01:04:44.166 --> 01:04:45.625
You're right.

01:04:47.458 --> 01:04:48.917
I'm sorry, Howard.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.542
That's Agent Shuster!

01:04:50.625 --> 01:04:52.709
Oh, what?
I can't call you
by your first name

01:04:52.792 --> 01:04:55.333
'cause I'm not
a member of the
groovy tie squad?

01:04:55.417 --> 01:04:57.208
No, it's because
you're an asshole.

01:04:57.291 --> 01:04:58.458
I am not.

01:04:59.458 --> 01:05:00.750
Yeah, you are.

01:05:00.834 --> 01:05:02.000
Everyone thinks
you are.

01:05:02.083 --> 01:05:03.375
Including your wife.

01:05:03.458 --> 01:05:04.583
Why do you think
she left you?

01:05:06.917 --> 01:05:10.041
Well, her job
relocated her to Paris.

01:05:10.125 --> 01:05:12.417
Bullshit.
Right now she's up
in Kennebunkport

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.458
gettin' poked
by some lobster
fisherman.

01:05:16.792 --> 01:05:18.333
DAVIS: Aah!

01:05:18.417 --> 01:05:20.333
Wait a minute there.
Come on, easy!

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:21.417
DAVIS: You're dead!

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.583
SHUSTER: At ease!

01:05:22.667 --> 01:05:24.000
(YELLING)

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.500
DAVIS: I'm gonna kill you!

01:05:27.208 --> 01:05:28.208
Let go!

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:31.250
(GASPS)

01:05:31.333 --> 01:05:32.750
Jesus! Corky,
you scared me.

01:05:32.834 --> 01:05:34.208
Why are you
still here?

01:05:35.333 --> 01:05:36.542
I'm not leaving
until I get

01:05:36.625 --> 01:05:38.542
the old man on tape
talking about murder.

01:05:38.875 --> 01:05:40.542
Murder?

01:05:40.625 --> 01:05:41.583
I thought we were
trying to get him

01:05:41.667 --> 01:05:44.417
for gambling or tax evasion,
things like that.

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.709
No, that's nothing.

01:05:45.792 --> 01:05:47.166
We wanna put him away
for life.

01:05:51.834 --> 01:05:53.917
Look... (SIGHS)

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.583
This assignment
is over, okay?

01:05:55.667 --> 01:05:56.917
You've gotta
get out of here.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.458
No, I'm not done.

01:05:58.542 --> 01:05:59.917
It's straight
from Shuster.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.208
You're through.

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:42.959
Well, I did it.
I got your evidence.

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:44.125
You did?

01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:45.792
Yeah, only
you know what?

01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:47.166
I'm thinking about
giving it back.

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:48.709
What?
Kidnapping?

01:06:48.792 --> 01:06:51.500
And... And... And...
And murder?

01:06:51.583 --> 01:06:53.709
What did you...
What did you...
What did you think,

01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:55.792
that I just wasn't
gonna figure it out?

01:06:55.875 --> 01:06:58.667
Corky, I've been involved
in my share of scams,

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:00.542
but I never done
none of those things.

01:07:00.625 --> 01:07:02.000
That's bullshit.

01:07:02.083 --> 01:07:03.208
You gotta believe me.

01:07:03.291 --> 01:07:05.333
Why? Why would I
believe you?

01:07:05.417 --> 01:07:07.375
I swear on
your mother's eyes,

01:07:07.458 --> 01:07:08.959
I never done
those things.

01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:10.333
Where did you get this?

01:07:10.417 --> 01:07:13.125
It's right...
It's here in...

01:07:13.208 --> 01:07:14.792
I don't know
specifically where,

01:07:14.875 --> 01:07:16.709
but it's here
in the sworn testimony.

01:07:16.792 --> 01:07:19.208
Pops, check out
the caldones
on this broad.

01:07:19.583 --> 01:07:20.917
Testimony.

01:07:22.291 --> 01:07:25.375
Testimony by who?

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:28.083
Testimony?
You got the evidence?

01:07:28.166 --> 01:07:30.500
Hey, Petey,
he got the evidence!

01:07:44.458 --> 01:07:45.583
Good job, kid.

01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:49.041
Yeah, I knew you had
the grapes for it.

01:07:49.125 --> 01:07:50.917
Tell you what,
I'll get rid of this.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.542
Wait a minute.

01:07:52.625 --> 01:07:54.166
Not until I get
some answers here,

01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:56.834
'cause there are some
serious accusations
in this file.

01:07:56.917 --> 01:07:58.333
Please, Corky,
since when do you
give a damn

01:07:58.417 --> 01:08:00.250
about anything
having to do
with this family?

01:08:00.333 --> 01:08:02.875
Corky, let
the adults talk.
Come here.

01:08:02.959 --> 01:08:05.000
Now, you done
a good job,

01:08:05.083 --> 01:08:06.709
you got the evidence,

01:08:06.792 --> 01:08:07.917
but you don't
belong here.

01:08:09.125 --> 01:08:10.166
So go home.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.250
PAULIE: Oh, yeah! We are
back in business, fellas.

01:08:27.332 --> 01:08:28.457
Pops is back.

01:08:28.542 --> 01:08:29.542
PETER: I'll drink to that!

01:08:37.457 --> 01:08:39.125
(MEN LAUGHING)

01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:47.582
PETER: Let's talk about...

01:08:47.667 --> 01:08:49.082
What are you
still doin' here?

01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:50.792
Don't you got some
puppies to breastfeed

01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:52.291
or some shit
like that?

01:08:52.375 --> 01:08:54.582
I'm not going anywhere
until I'm damn well ready,

01:08:54.667 --> 01:08:56.792
'cause I am sick
of being your lapdog.

01:08:56.875 --> 01:08:59.875
Ooh, the other sister's
standing up for herself.

01:09:01.207 --> 01:09:04.792
Ooh! Hey! Ow! Oh!

01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:07.959
I'm as much a part
of this family as
either one of you.

01:09:08.041 --> 01:09:09.417
I put my life
on the line.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.291
I kept pops
out of jail.

01:09:11.375 --> 01:09:12.750
I paid my dues.

01:09:12.834 --> 01:09:14.457
Now you start
showing me

01:09:14.542 --> 01:09:15.959
a little goddamn respect!

01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:17.457
PAULIE: All right!

01:09:17.542 --> 01:09:20.041
You're a part of this family.
Now get off of me.

01:09:22.332 --> 01:09:23.917
You wanna try that with me,
you little pussy?

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.959
Don't you touch him!

01:09:28.041 --> 01:09:29.792
Pops, you're gonna
get excited.

01:09:29.875 --> 01:09:31.875
Shut up.
I'm already excited.

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:33.834
Now leave
your brother alone.

01:09:33.917 --> 01:09:35.332
Oh, sure, Pops.
Take his side.

01:09:35.417 --> 01:09:36.959
You always do
take his side.

01:09:37.041 --> 01:09:38.625
What are you
talkin' about?

01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:40.000
PAULIE: You sent
him to college.

01:09:40.082 --> 01:09:41.291
You never sent me
to college.

01:09:41.375 --> 01:09:44.500
You showed that
nurse more respect
than you showed me!

01:09:44.582 --> 01:09:46.625
I saw you teachin'
her how to read!

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.125
You never taught me
how to read!

01:09:50.207 --> 01:09:53.375
Which is why
I still don't know
how to read!

01:09:53.457 --> 01:09:54.667
POPS: Don't be ridiculous.

01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:56.000
Of course
you know how to read.

01:09:56.083 --> 01:09:58.667
I see you with magazines
all the time.

01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:01.625
Penthouse, Swank, Hustler.

01:10:05.583 --> 01:10:08.625
Oh, shit.

01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:09.959
PAULIE:
You remember that...
That time

01:10:10.041 --> 01:10:12.208
I got arrested
at Tony Roma's

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:15.041
for exposing myself
in the ladies' room?

01:10:15.125 --> 01:10:17.417
I thought it was
the men's room!

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:20.166
And what about
the time that Uncle Leo
sent me to the store

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:21.375
for a carton
of Marlboros

01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:22.709
and I come back
with a...

01:10:22.792 --> 01:10:24.834
With a carton of tampons?

01:10:25.583 --> 01:10:27.709
Feminine products!

01:10:27.792 --> 01:10:29.291
You thought
it was funny, right?

01:10:30.458 --> 01:10:32.834
I was upstairs
in my room crying.

01:10:35.083 --> 01:10:36.834
Don't stare at me like
I'm some kind of a freak

01:10:36.917 --> 01:10:38.542
because I'll tell you
all something else.

01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:39.625
He's a homo.

01:10:46.959 --> 01:10:48.709
No, I'm not, Pops.

01:10:48.792 --> 01:10:50.709
Huh. I'm not...
I love boobies.

01:10:50.792 --> 01:10:51.917
Oh, bullshit.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.875
You got a collection
of mesh tank tops.

01:10:53.959 --> 01:10:56.792
You got a poster
of Matthew Perry
up in your bedroom.

01:10:56.875 --> 01:10:59.458
You got
Divas Live  on DVD,
for Christ's sakes.

01:10:59.542 --> 01:11:01.542
You are one big faggot.

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:04.083
Well, at least
I can read the labels,
you illiterate mook!

01:11:04.166 --> 01:11:05.709
Take it back,
you fruit loop.

01:11:05.792 --> 01:11:07.583
You want me to learn you
how to spell "dead man"?

01:11:07.667 --> 01:11:09.250
How 'bout some
of this, then? Huh?

01:11:09.333 --> 01:11:10.709
How 'bout this, eh?

01:11:11.333 --> 01:11:12.375
Stop it!

01:11:12.458 --> 01:11:14.417
Just stop it.

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.125
Ooh, help me, I'm gay.

01:11:16.792 --> 01:11:18.458
Ooh, I can't read.

01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:19.959
I don't care
how gay you are,

01:11:20.041 --> 01:11:21.959
and I don't care
how stupid you are.

01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:25.333
Get over it! Okay?

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:27.750
Get over it.
Okay.

01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:30.166
Huh?

01:11:33.125 --> 01:11:35.208
(BOTH SOBBING)

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:36.792
I can't read.

01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:38.291
I'm a fag.

01:11:38.375 --> 01:11:40.041
All right. Shh.

01:11:42.208 --> 01:11:43.750
All right.

01:11:43.834 --> 01:11:46.083
(SIGHS) All right,
everybody out of the room.

01:11:46.166 --> 01:11:47.709
I need to speak
to my father...

01:11:49.333 --> 01:11:50.500
Alone.

01:11:50.583 --> 01:11:52.625
Really, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.

01:11:55.542 --> 01:11:57.583
Corky! Look at you!

01:11:58.709 --> 01:12:00.583
Takin' control
of the family.

01:12:00.667 --> 01:12:03.458
I never thought
I'd see the day.

01:12:03.542 --> 01:12:05.625
I never thought
I would, either.

01:12:05.709 --> 01:12:07.709
You know what you
looked like just now?

01:12:08.542 --> 01:12:10.458
Your mother.

01:12:10.542 --> 01:12:12.125
Your mother
was the glue

01:12:12.208 --> 01:12:14.083
that held this
family together.

01:12:14.166 --> 01:12:16.000
You got
the same instincts.

01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:18.792
I see a lot
of her in you.

01:12:25.583 --> 01:12:27.000
Is that why you sent me away?

01:12:27.083 --> 01:12:28.208
POPS: You know what?

01:12:28.291 --> 01:12:32.000
I sent you away
because I love you.

01:12:32.083 --> 01:12:34.250
You're not cut out
for this business.

01:12:35.458 --> 01:12:38.166
You're cut out
for something better.

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:40.542
And you proved that.

01:12:40.625 --> 01:12:42.166
I just wanted to be
part of the family,

01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:43.667
just on my own terms.

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:45.583
You are part
of the family.

01:12:47.041 --> 01:12:48.542
You're my son.

01:13:05.417 --> 01:13:07.709
For what it's worth,
I believe you didn't
do those things.

01:13:07.792 --> 01:13:09.750
And I think I know why
they think you did.

01:13:10.583 --> 01:13:12.083

Dad's having
a heart attack!

He's gone, Leo.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.250
His last words, Leo,

01:13:48.333 --> 01:13:49.792
he was calling out
for you.

01:13:52.333 --> 01:13:53.959
Now's your chance
to make your peace.

01:14:01.458 --> 01:14:03.291
Why would Pissant
steal the evidence?

01:14:03.375 --> 01:14:05.417
DAVIS: He's been in bed
with 'em since day one.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.458
Just hope he hasn't
killed Russo yet.

01:14:07.542 --> 01:14:10.041
God, I haven't been
on a raid in 10 years.

01:14:11.792 --> 01:14:13.917
All right, ladies.
Are we ready to rock and roll?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.166
(GUNS COCKING)

01:14:23.875 --> 01:14:25.041
Look, Pop...

01:14:27.583 --> 01:14:30.250
I may be a liar,
and I may be a coward,

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:31.917
but all I ever wanted

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
was a shot at
running the business.

01:14:36.166 --> 01:14:38.834
I'm sorry I gave you
a heart attack, you old jerk.

01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:42.417
I just wanted you
out of the way.

01:14:43.166 --> 01:14:45.417
Oh!

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:49.333
But I swear to god, Pop,
if you were alive right now,

01:14:49.417 --> 01:14:52.208
I'd tell the feds that none
of this shit I said was true.

01:14:53.375 --> 01:14:55.417
LEO: I swear
on my father's name.

01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:57.709
That rat bastard.

01:15:00.333 --> 01:15:01.750
Old jerk, huh?

01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:05.542
(COCKS GUN)
Sorry, Leo.

01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:07.333
Just lookin' out
for the family.

01:15:07.417 --> 01:15:09.917
Corky! You set this up?

01:15:11.041 --> 01:15:12.875
And now you're
going to arrest me?

01:15:12.959 --> 01:15:15.291
Ha! That's a laugh.

01:15:15.375 --> 01:15:18.000
You're the biggest pussy
in the world.

01:15:18.083 --> 01:15:20.959
Don't you ever
call my son a pussy.

01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:23.375
You know, I can't believe
we trusted you, Leo.

01:15:23.458 --> 01:15:24.875
(GUN COCKS)

01:15:24.959 --> 01:15:27.125
So now you're giving out
lectures on ethics?

01:15:29.041 --> 01:15:30.917
(CHUCKLES) Yeah,
I know that one.

01:15:32.083 --> 01:15:35.208
So what are you?
A fed or one of them?

01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:36.792
CORKY: I'm one of them.

01:15:36.875 --> 01:15:38.125
I was pretending
to be a fed.

01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:40.792
Because?

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:43.500
Because I didn't
think my father

01:15:43.583 --> 01:15:45.500
deserved to die
in jail.

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:47.834
So where did I fit
into your little plan?

01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:50.083
(GUN COCKS)

01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:52.709
I may be illiterate,
but I'm not stupid.

01:15:52.792 --> 01:15:54.166
(GUN COCKS)

01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:55.667

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:57.875
(GUN COCKS)

01:15:57.959 --> 01:15:59.208
Who the hell
are you?

01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:00.333
Brick Davis.

01:16:00.417 --> 01:16:02.000
Oh. Freeze, Brick.

01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:04.458
(GUNS COCKING)

01:16:07.792 --> 01:16:09.250
(ALL CLAMORING)

01:16:09.333 --> 01:16:10.792
Freeze! Drop
your weapons! Now!

01:16:12.625 --> 01:16:13.959
Put 'em on the ground!

01:16:19.125 --> 01:16:20.834
Drop your weapons!
Drop it!

01:16:20.917 --> 01:16:22.667
You put
the gun down!

01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:24.083
Put your
weapons down!

01:16:54.542 --> 01:16:55.583
SHUSTER: Russo,
you wanna tell me

01:16:55.667 --> 01:16:56.917
what the hell's
going on here?

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.208
Sir, these...

01:16:58.291 --> 01:16:59.917
What's going on?
The guy that did it

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.417
just run out of the room,

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:04.041
and you're standing here
in your orange tie

01:17:04.125 --> 01:17:05.750
wondering what's going on.

01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:08.083
Sir, Corky went after
the real criminal.

01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:09.750
I knew it.

01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:11.083
Corky's one of us!

01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:19.542
(GRUNTING)

01:17:22.208 --> 01:17:23.250
Okay.

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:35.917
(GRUNTING)

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:53.291
(GROANS)

01:17:56.458 --> 01:17:58.000
Better face facts,
little man.

01:17:58.083 --> 01:17:59.500
Your luck just ran out.

01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:00.917
Wanna tell me
what time it is,

01:18:01.458 --> 01:18:03.333
Mr. Night Vulture?

01:18:03.417 --> 01:18:05.792
Good one.
I'll take that.

01:18:05.875 --> 01:18:08.000
You know,
I never thought
I'd live to see the day

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:11.375
that an FBI agent would
be peddling smack.

01:18:11.458 --> 01:18:12.834
Don't act so surprised.

01:18:12.917 --> 01:18:14.667
J. Edgar Hoover
used to wear a dress.

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:15.834
Just tell me why, Brick.

01:18:15.917 --> 01:18:18.333
I don't know.
I suppose it made him
feel sexy.

01:18:18.417 --> 01:18:19.875
Not Hoover, you!

01:18:19.959 --> 01:18:21.542
I think it's time
to get on with the meeting.

01:18:21.625 --> 01:18:23.166
What meeting?

01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:24.917
The meeting
between your genitals

01:18:26.375 --> 01:18:27.417
and this knife.

01:18:28.542 --> 01:18:30.000
What's going on?

01:18:30.083 --> 01:18:31.208
He's the Night Vulture.

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:32.834
What?

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:34.125
Corky, watch out.

01:18:37.792 --> 01:18:39.458
CORKY AND RUSSO:
Nim-ha!

01:18:40.583 --> 01:18:41.959
(GROANING)

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.125
Move in!
Let's go!

01:18:47.625 --> 01:18:48.834
What the hell
are you doing?

01:18:48.917 --> 01:18:50.667
Brick is
the Night Vulture.

01:18:53.291 --> 01:18:54.500
RUSSO: It's true, sir.

01:18:54.583 --> 01:18:56.750
Oh, God, Howard.

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:03.709
Take me away. Oh!

01:19:03.792 --> 01:19:06.375
My God, Corky. That's two
you've given us today.

01:19:06.458 --> 01:19:10.000
No, sir, that's two
we've given you.

01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:12.125
(CHUCKLES) Well.

01:19:13.959 --> 01:19:16.625
Looks like we have more
to look forward to, huh?

01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:19.834
I'm afraid not, Howard.
I got other plans.

01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:23.333
(LAUGHS)

01:19:24.542 --> 01:19:26.375
Hmm. (LAUGHS)

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:28.625
Let's go.

01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:31.375
Let's hit the gym.

01:19:34.792 --> 01:19:36.333
(BELLS RINGING)

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.375
Yay, Corky!

01:19:50.542 --> 01:19:51.709
Bravo!

01:19:53.333 --> 01:19:54.500
Russo!

01:20:05.583 --> 01:20:09.125
Corky, you made me
so proud of you.

01:20:09.208 --> 01:20:10.625
I love you.

01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:12.083
I love you, too,
Daddy.

01:20:14.375 --> 01:20:16.500
I got an announcement
to make.

01:20:17.542 --> 01:20:19.583
My son here,
this big lug,

01:20:20.208 --> 01:20:21.917
he's a fruit,

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.917
and I don't care
who knows it.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.500
Come here, you gay bastard.
I love you.

01:20:27.041 --> 01:20:28.250
I love you, too.

01:20:30.041 --> 01:20:33.625
The other one,
he can't read
a stop sign.

01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:36.166
And I wouldn't have it
any other way.

01:20:36.250 --> 01:20:38.917
Come here,
you freakin' retard.

01:20:39.041 --> 01:20:40.083
I love you.

01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:49.125
Corky, get out of here

01:20:49.208 --> 01:20:50.709
before I punch you
in the mouth.

01:20:50.792 --> 01:20:51.917
Okay, Dad.

01:20:53.375 --> 01:20:54.709
(CHEERING)

01:21:02.083 --> 01:21:04.375
Hey, Corky, good luck
with the vet business.

01:21:04.458 --> 01:21:05.500
Oh!

01:21:05.583 --> 01:21:07.166
I know you're
gonna do just fine.

01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:09.125
Dr. Kipper, I will
never forget you.

01:21:09.208 --> 01:21:10.625
Congratulations.
