WEBVTT

00:05.806 --> 00:06.972
What are you doing?

00:06.974 --> 00:09.641
Oh, soaking up rays, babe.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.777
Except your sun lamps
not working.

00:11.779 --> 00:14.947
I've been sitting here
for five hours.

00:14.949 --> 00:16.548
Nada.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.317
Five hours?

00:18.319 --> 00:20.285
ALF, you're lucky
you didn't get a sunburn.

00:20.287 --> 00:21.887
[screaming ]

00:21.889 --> 00:23.455
Sorry.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.992
Oh! Oh, it hurts.
It hurts.

00:26.994 --> 00:30.662
Well, would you, would you
like some cold cream?

00:30.664 --> 00:33.132
Yeah. Uh, but just one scoop.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.566
I'm on a diet.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.336
It's for your nose.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.638
That's where I'm trying
to lose the weight.

00:40.841 --> 00:44.209
ALF, I'm talking
about cold cream.

00:44.211 --> 00:47.713
Huh, not ice cream,
cold cream.

00:47.715 --> 00:48.881
You understand?

00:48.883 --> 00:51.417
You're talking like
they're two different things.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.987
They are!
Haven't you been listening?

00:54.989 --> 00:57.723
What is this,
healing through hollering?

01:00.194 --> 01:01.860
Brian..

01:01.862 --> 01:03.328
...what happened?

01:03.330 --> 01:05.764
Yeah, you look terrible.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.933
- I was in a fight.
- Oh.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.601
Looking like that?

01:09.603 --> 01:10.736
Yeesh!

01:12.173 --> 01:13.972
[theme music]

01:42.236 --> 01:44.036
[music continues]

02:14.335 --> 02:15.567
[instrumental music]

02:17.271 --> 02:18.670
Ow!

02:18.672 --> 02:20.572
Nobody does this
to my little pal

02:20.574 --> 02:22.641
and gets away with it.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.843
Unless they're over
three feet tall.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.613
Brian, what happened?

02:27.615 --> 02:29.815
I was in a fight
with Bobby Duncan.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.317
Who is Bobby Duncan?

02:32.319 --> 02:33.952
Isn't he that smart-mouth
little punk

02:33.954 --> 02:35.320
who lives down the street?

02:35.322 --> 02:36.455
Yeah.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.357
We have to retaliate.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.092
You beat up his mother

02:40.094 --> 02:41.460
you beat up his sister

02:41.462 --> 02:43.695
and I'll eat up his cat.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.466
We're not rumbling
with the Duncan's.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.134
Brian, what started the fight?

02:49.136 --> 02:51.703
Yeah, was it over some woman?

02:51.705 --> 02:53.438
Kind of. Yeah.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.607
Alright, Brian!

02:55.609 --> 02:57.309
Look, it doesn't matter
what started it

02:57.311 --> 02:59.344
I don't want you fighting.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.548
But Bobby said you were
old, ugly, and dumb.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.619
Well...even so..

03:07.621 --> 03:10.489
...next time just ignore him.

03:10.491 --> 03:11.924
The little brat.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.459
Don't let it bother you, mom

03:14.461 --> 03:16.228
all kids think adults are old.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.163
And ugly and dumb?

03:18.165 --> 03:20.065
He's entitled to his opinion.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.203
So anyway, I hit him.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.905
Except, he hit me back harder.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.974
Over...and over.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.478
Well, I know that you think
you were standing up for me

03:33.480 --> 03:35.147
but you shouldn't fight.

03:36.183 --> 03:38.317
Has he ever actually seen me?

03:38.319 --> 03:39.618
Yeah.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.355
I think I should give
Bobby's mother a call.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.690
No!

03:44.692 --> 03:46.525
But he might
beat you up again.

03:46.527 --> 03:50.028
I'd rather get beat up,
than be called a snitch.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.664
Yeah, that's the worst.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.901
On Melmac, some guy
called me a snitch.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.837
Just because I turned him
in to the secret police.

04:02.042 --> 04:05.644
Listen, when Bobby saw me,
was I in curlers at the time?

04:07.014 --> 04:08.180
Let it go, Kate.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.617
[instrumental music]

04:15.256 --> 04:16.955
Alright, after this lesson

04:16.957 --> 04:19.424
you'll never get
beat up at school again.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.693
I'm not going to
school anymore.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.295
Don't say that.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.097
School's very important.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.766
If you dropout
you wont get anywhere in life.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.269
You'll just hang around
the house all day

04:30.271 --> 04:32.304
eating and watching TV.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.139
But I wanna be like you.

04:36.143 --> 04:38.610
I don't know whether
to laugh or cry.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.780
Let's get back
to Fist-to-Cuff school.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.382
What do you know
about fighting?

04:43.384 --> 04:44.816
Are you kidding?

04:44.818 --> 04:47.953
They used to call me
Sugar Ray Shumway.

04:47.955 --> 04:52.257
I could have been a contender
if it weren't for my glass nose.

04:52.259 --> 04:53.292
Really?

04:53.294 --> 04:55.227
[screaming]
My sunburn.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.428
Sorry.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.929
No problem.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.499
Now, first
you must learn to focus

05:00.501 --> 05:03.568
all your energy on one thing.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.173
What are you focusing on?

05:08.175 --> 05:10.742
Your candy bar.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.278
Brian, if I am gonna
teach you how to fight

05:13.280 --> 05:17.683
I'll need the energy
of a 1,000 empty calories.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.018
Uh, alright here.

05:21.255 --> 05:22.921
You learn fast, Grasshopper.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.059
You eat fast, Sugar Ray.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.163
Alright, now, the trick here

05:31.165 --> 05:34.333
is to concentrate
all your energy

05:34.335 --> 05:36.034
and let it explode

05:36.036 --> 05:38.970
in a blinding flash
of destruction.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.038
Watch.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.675
Hee-yah!

05:44.545 --> 05:46.445
Alright!

05:46.447 --> 05:48.613
Well, that never worked before.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.182
Do it again.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.249
Okay.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.553
Hee-yah!

05:56.190 --> 05:58.390
I guess there's only pain

05:58.392 --> 06:00.292
when you don't break the board.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.562
Unbelievable pain.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.499
Hey, Brian.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.668
You-your mother
told me what happened.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.002
Are you okay?

06:11.004 --> 06:13.872
Yeah, ALF's teaching
me the martial arts.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.208
I don't want you teaching
my son to fight, ALF.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.578
Call an ambulance.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.347
I'm serious, ALF.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.982
Oh, and I'm not?

06:23.984 --> 06:25.517
I broke my hand.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.085
Wha.. Let me see if that..

06:27.654 --> 06:29.488
It looks fine.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.323
Thank you, Professor X-ray.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.025
It's fine, ALF.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.394
It's fine.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.862
Oh. Hey, that feels good.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.597
Could you do my shoulders?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.933
You know, ALF,
if you really wanna help

06:41.935 --> 06:43.835
you'd teach him not to fight.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.670
Well, he already knows
how to do that.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.706
Look at his face.

06:47.708 --> 06:51.176
Excuse me, ALF,
I know whereof I speak.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.878
You see, when I
was about Brian's age

06:52.880 --> 06:54.546
there was a bully
who lived on our block

06:54.548 --> 06:57.048
who was always picking on me.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.250
Whereof?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.186
Sorry.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.187
I'm still fascinated

07:02.189 --> 07:04.956
by the oddities
of the English language.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.093
Anyway..

07:08.095 --> 07:10.562
...this bully,
his name was Clarence--

07:10.564 --> 07:12.731
Oh-ha! Tough neighborhood.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.065
[laughing]

07:14.067 --> 07:15.801
[screaming]

07:19.206 --> 07:21.907
Every day I'd try
to stand up to him

07:21.909 --> 07:24.409
and every day he'd beat me up.

07:24.411 --> 07:26.745
Until finally my father told me

07:26.747 --> 07:29.247
to just turn the other cheek.

07:29.249 --> 07:32.818
Is this the same grandfather
that talked to corn chips?

07:34.822 --> 07:37.055
He was a wise man.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.324
And, see, you know
what happened?

07:40.327 --> 07:41.927
When I refused to fight

07:41.929 --> 07:43.995
Clarence stopped bothering me.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.832
You see, it's no fun
to pick on someone

07:46.834 --> 07:48.834
who won't fight back.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.769
So tomorrow,
Bobby comes up to you

07:50.771 --> 07:52.838
if he starts teasing you..

07:52.840 --> 07:55.474
...I want you
to just walk away, okay?

07:55.476 --> 07:56.975
Okay.

07:56.977 --> 08:00.345
Willie, my hand still hurts.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.746
Kiss it?

08:09.623 --> 08:12.190
Whoa. How continental.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.327
[instrumental music]

08:18.799 --> 08:20.432
I love you too, mom.

08:20.434 --> 08:21.766
Buh-bye.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.805
Why...are...those boards

08:26.807 --> 08:28.473
in the fireplace?

08:28.475 --> 08:31.042
ALF said, "If you
can't break 'em, burn 'em."

08:32.212 --> 08:33.245
ALF!

08:33.680 --> 08:35.080
Boing!

08:36.984 --> 08:38.116
ALF..

08:38.118 --> 08:39.618
...we are not
going to let you burn

08:39.620 --> 08:41.453
perfectly good lumber.

08:41.455 --> 08:43.221
Oh, right, one of these days

08:43.223 --> 08:45.724
Willie's gonna build
that gazebo.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.628
Brian, what's wrong.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.829
Nothing. See you tomorrow.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.999
Oh, no, not again.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.568
- Brian.
- Hi, dad.

08:56.570 --> 08:59.170
Bobby beat me up again.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.839
Oh, no.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.174
I tried to walk away,
like you said..

09:03.176 --> 09:05.911
...but he was sitting
on me at the time.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.179
Lynn, you get the first-aid kit.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.081
Come on, Bri,
let me clean you up.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.885
Alright! That's it!

09:13.887 --> 09:16.922
I say we fight violence
with violence.

09:16.924 --> 09:19.190
That's how we solved
things back home.

09:19.192 --> 09:23.094
But, ALF, don't you remember
what happened to your planet?

09:23.096 --> 09:25.997
Well, it blew up
in a nuclear holocaust. Why?

09:27.034 --> 09:29.267
Don't you see the connection?

09:31.405 --> 09:32.771
What connection?

09:33.607 --> 09:35.206
I give up.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.374
Me, too.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.877
I'm gonna lie down,
my head is spinning.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.979
Maybe a cold cream sundae.

09:42.516 --> 09:45.784
Lynn, when did ALF started
eating cold cream?

09:45.786 --> 09:47.919
Hmm, about a month ago.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.294
You should have heard
what Bobby said.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.630
Did he insult me again?

09:58.632 --> 10:00.899
No. Dad.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.601
What did he say about me?

10:02.603 --> 10:04.069
He said you must
have been desperate

10:04.071 --> 10:06.371
to marry someone like mom.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.843
I'm glad to see
he's off my case.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.779
Did he say
anything about me?

10:14.781 --> 10:17.349
Yeah. He said you were cute.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.986
Does he know
I'm mom's daughter?

10:24.324 --> 10:26.291
This isn't funny.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.561
I'm sorry, Bri,
but I'm afraid

10:29.563 --> 10:31.463
I'm gonna have to call
Bobby's mother.

10:31.465 --> 10:34.766
Save your dialing finger, Kate,
she's not home.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.735
She went down
to the liquor store.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.470
Who told you that?

10:38.472 --> 10:40.005
Bobby's father.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.973
Oh, by the way,
he's coming over here

10:41.975 --> 10:44.342
to beat the stuffing
out of Willie.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.778
What? Why?

10:46.780 --> 10:50.315
Well, he didn't like the way
you talked to him on the phone.

10:51.985 --> 10:55.286
ALF...I thought we agreed
that you'd stop

10:55.288 --> 10:58.356
impersonating me on the phone.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.525
We agreed I would stop
impersonating

11:00.527 --> 11:02.394
the cast of "Green Acres."

11:03.463 --> 11:05.497
Although, Mr. Haney

11:05.499 --> 11:07.098
could have sold Brian..

11:07.100 --> 11:09.668
...some revivifying potion..

11:09.670 --> 11:12.070
...out of the back of his truck.

11:13.974 --> 11:18.309
ALF, what did I say,
to Bobby's father?

11:18.311 --> 11:20.545
You were a bit rough actually.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.247
It was so unlike you.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.117
What did he say to me?

11:27.387 --> 11:29.020
He said that..

11:29.022 --> 11:31.556
...he was gonna turn your face
into silly putty.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.061
Hey, look at the bright side

11:36.063 --> 11:39.831
you'll be able
to reproduce the Sunday comics.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.166
[doorbell ringing]

11:41.168 --> 11:43.501
That might be Bobby's dad.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.669
I'm outta here.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.071
Hey, and don't worry, Willie

11:46.073 --> 11:49.074
we won't let them
keep you alive artificially.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.550
[breathing heavily]

12:00.387 --> 12:02.420
He-hello, you-you
must be Mr. Duncan.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.521
Yeah.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.590
So you're gonna
rip my face off, huh?

12:07.027 --> 12:08.560
You know, I never
meant to say that.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.095
I-I was upset about Brian

12:10.097 --> 12:13.865
uh, please, please
accept my apology.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.000
You beat up Bruce Lee?

12:17.704 --> 12:19.471
Not the Bruce Lee.

12:20.907 --> 12:25.343
Uh, I mean, not
the, uh, karate Bruce Lee.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.446
In fact his name wasn't
actually Bruce, it was Herman.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.450
Won't you come in?

12:35.222 --> 12:39.090
Ah, ha ha.
I get the picture.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.626
You're one of those weasels
who talks tough on the phone

12:41.628 --> 12:43.862
but can't back it up.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.363
Basically, yeah.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.766
Oh, this must be Mrs. Weasel.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.135
So pleased to meet you.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.903
I donno
why I bother comin' over?

12:51.905 --> 12:53.404
I could have just sent Bobby.

12:53.406 --> 12:56.207
Say, look here,
I've said I was sorry.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.575
Now, if you're not
big enough to accept--

12:57.577 --> 12:59.477
Hey, hey, hey, is that
a crack about my height?

12:59.479 --> 13:01.212
Because I have
beat up bigger guys

13:01.214 --> 13:03.615
than you just to get
to a fight, Four Eyes.

13:03.617 --> 13:06.618
Ha. Ha. Four Eyes.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.520
Very original. Hmm.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.590
What's happening out there?

13:12.592 --> 13:15.260
Mr. Duncan called
dad "Four Eyes."

13:15.262 --> 13:17.295
Four Eyes! Ha ha.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.398
Oh, that Duncan.
What a yo-yo.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.466
Shh!

13:23.236 --> 13:24.903
Look, we're not
looking for any trouble

13:24.905 --> 13:27.572
we just want your son
to stop picking on Brian.

13:27.574 --> 13:31.509
Hey, hey, Bobby told me
your son threw the first punch.

13:31.511 --> 13:35.113
Well, that's because your son
called me old and ugly and dumb.

13:35.115 --> 13:39.017
Ugly? Better get that
kid some glasses, huh?

13:40.287 --> 13:42.253
No, uh..
Better make that contacts.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.455
Right, Four Eyes?

13:44.457 --> 13:47.025
You know,
that joke gets less funny

13:47.027 --> 13:50.595
every time I hear it...shorty.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.769
Mom, dad, is it time
for church yet?

13:57.771 --> 14:01.739
Aww, are you trying to get
your daddy out of a fight?

14:02.943 --> 14:05.810
Guess whose idea that was?

14:05.812 --> 14:08.513
I don't need my daughter
to keep me from fighting.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.816
No, um, you can run away
from fights on your own.

14:11.818 --> 14:13.418
That's it.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.154
I'd like you to leave now.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.489
Oh, I'm scared, I'm scared.

14:18.491 --> 14:21.159
I've heard quite enough
from you, more than enough.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.661
- Too much!
- Is that so, sissy boy?

14:23.663 --> 14:24.996
Yes, it is.

14:24.998 --> 14:28.633
You obnoxious little man!

14:29.369 --> 14:31.102
[thud]

14:33.340 --> 14:35.840
Way to go, Four Eyes! Yeah!

14:39.246 --> 14:41.145
What have I done?

14:45.252 --> 14:46.651
[instrumental music]

14:49.689 --> 14:51.022
Doughnut, Willie?

14:51.024 --> 14:53.558
Hey, no sweets
for Boom-Boom Tanner.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.260
He's in training.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.061
I'm not in training.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.429
Yes, you are.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.399
I got you a fight with
Mr. Hurlbut down the street.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.036
Mr. Hurlbut is my friend!

15:05.038 --> 15:07.872
Not after the way
you talked to him.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.707
Stop calling people!

15:09.709 --> 15:11.609
Hey, don't hit, don't hit!

15:13.246 --> 15:15.046
It was wrong, what I did.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.081
I feel very bad about it.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.050
Oh, honey, don't
torture yourself.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.852
Yeah, the bum deserved it.

15:20.854 --> 15:24.289
He was a short,
beady-eyed loudmouth.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.758
Unlike anyone we know.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.794
I'm not beady-eyed.

15:29.796 --> 15:32.030
[doorbell dings]

15:32.032 --> 15:33.264
Wonder who that could be?

15:33.266 --> 15:36.234
Well, hard to say.
I called so many people.

15:36.236 --> 15:39.604
Everyone wants to take
a poke at the champ.

15:39.606 --> 15:43.308
I'm just glad Mike Tyson
lives in New York.

15:43.310 --> 15:46.444
Actually, he's thinking
about moving out here.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.717
Hey, that's what his
girlfriend told me.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.558
Hi, Tanner.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.994
Whatever I said on
the phone, I'm sorry.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.562
What are talking about?

16:04.564 --> 16:08.232
I just came over here
to congratulate you, Killer.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.101
It's Boom-Boom.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.436
Everyone is talking about

16:11.438 --> 16:13.438
what Willie did
to that awful Mr. Duncan.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.440
Well, how did they find out?

16:15.442 --> 16:17.442
From me, of course.

16:17.444 --> 16:20.912
Yeah, there's three ways
news can travel..

16:20.914 --> 16:24.649
Telephone, telegraph,
and tell Raquel.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.285
So what happened, Killer?
Give us a blow-by-blow. Come on.

16:27.287 --> 16:30.121
No, no, no,
I never meant to hurt him.

16:30.123 --> 16:33.658
Actually I was trying
to teach Brian not to fight.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.694
Well, you really pounded
that lesson home.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.496
I'm afraid so.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.799
Oh, don't feel bad, Willie.
Mr. Duncan deserved it.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.835
Do you know,
he had the nerve to complain

16:43.837 --> 16:46.938
about Trevor burning
tires in our yard.

16:46.940 --> 16:49.540
Like I can control the wind.

16:50.443 --> 16:53.478
How rude of Mr. Duncan.

16:53.480 --> 16:58.149
Well, in all fairness he wasn't
as rude as the fire marshal.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.484
Well, let's go, Raquel.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.486
If we overstay I reckon
Willie'll throw us out

17:01.488 --> 17:03.054
like yesterday's garbage.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.455
[chuckles]

17:06.626 --> 17:07.725
Bye, Killer.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.998
Willie is a hero.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.466
Just like Racky.

17:16.302 --> 17:19.003
Nothing like Rocky.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.506
Not Rocky. Racky.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.208
He was our hero back on Melmac.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.177
He was a tiny little raccoon.

17:26.179 --> 17:30.248
Who taught us all to wash
our food before we ate it.

17:32.318 --> 17:36.187
We've got to keep in mind
at all times

17:36.189 --> 17:38.623
he's not from this planet.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.761
Willie, if it'll make you
feel any better.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.931
Maybe you should try talking
to Mr. Duncan again.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.199
Hmm.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.668
Yeah, worked like a charm
the first time.

17:52.672 --> 17:53.838
You know, you are right, Kate.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.575
But this time
I am not going to fight.

17:57.577 --> 18:01.012
But I've already made you
some boxing trunks.

18:02.048 --> 18:05.283
I just rented that tuxedo.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.853
Sorry, I thought you owned it.

18:16.229 --> 18:21.065
Okay, if Willie can beat
Trevor and Mr. Litwak

18:21.067 --> 18:24.802
then we can get a bigger purse
when he fights Mrs. Byrd.

18:26.906 --> 18:31.075
We'll only take the purse
if they throw in matching shoes.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.143
Everything's settled?

18:32.145 --> 18:33.744
Oh, well,
Duncan's on his way over

18:33.746 --> 18:36.747
he wanted
to talk to me in person.

18:36.749 --> 18:37.882
Where's Brian?

18:37.884 --> 18:40.485
Is he gonna sing
the national anthem?

18:40.487 --> 18:43.221
No, I, I want him to be here.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.589
So that he can see

18:44.591 --> 18:47.458
that I can solve these
things without fighting.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.759
He's in his bedroom.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.128
[doorbell dings]

18:50.130 --> 18:51.496
Good luck, dad.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.465
Yeah. Hey, remember,
Willie, it's<i> your</i> title.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.968
He has to take
it away from<i> you.</i>

19:01.941 --> 19:03.374
Brian?

19:07.580 --> 19:09.347
Alright, Tanner. I'm back.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.782
Mr. Duncan, please come in.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.351
What is it?

19:13.353 --> 19:15.453
I wanted you to
meet Mr. Duncan.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.523
This is my son,
this is Brian.

19:18.525 --> 19:21.025
This is the kid that gave
my kid the black eye?

19:21.027 --> 19:22.260
[scoffs]

19:22.262 --> 19:24.028
You really gave
Bobby a black eye?

19:24.030 --> 19:25.630
Kate.

19:25.632 --> 19:28.299
I mean I hope he's okay.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.368
Can I get you anything?

19:30.370 --> 19:31.769
How about a beer?

19:31.771 --> 19:34.939
Of course.
It is almost noon.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.777
- Nice walk.
- Oh..

19:39.779 --> 19:41.512
That's my wife.

19:45.151 --> 19:46.384
[sighs]

19:47.654 --> 19:50.154
What's going on out there?

19:50.156 --> 19:52.523
Mr. Duncan likes
the way I walk.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.693
Me too! Especially when
you're carrying dinner.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.529
I hope dad gets this over with.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.665
That man gives me the creeps.

20:00.667 --> 20:04.569
Lynn, how could you say that?
Willie's your father!

20:06.673 --> 20:08.973
I was talking about Mr. Duncan.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.474
Oh, right.

20:13.179 --> 20:16.681
All I'm trying to do is to get
our kids to stop fighting.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.482
Why would you wanna do that?

20:18.484 --> 20:20.785
Fighting's good for kids.
It's exercise.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.788
Not for the guy on the ground.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.958
Oh, thanks, babe.

20:28.494 --> 20:31.062
You're welcome, bub.

20:31.064 --> 20:35.266
Anyway, where I grew up, we were
always fighting at-at home

20:35.268 --> 20:37.335
at school, at the pet store.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.703
At the pet store?

20:38.705 --> 20:40.338
Hey, I like fightin'.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.941
It's how I survived.
It made me what I am today.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.944
I'm in the scrap metal business
and it's a tough racket.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.579
Scrap metal?

20:49.215 --> 20:50.948
Keep the can.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.186
Hey, lady, is that a put-down?

20:55.188 --> 20:58.122
I'm a scrap metal dealer,
not a garbage man.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.857
There's a big difference.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.895
Oh, I think you're being
overly sensitive here.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.364
Oh, yeah?

21:06.366 --> 21:08.366
How would you like it if
I said you were the goofiest

21:08.368 --> 21:10.034
looking doofus I've ever met.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.738
- Wouldn't bother me.
- Dad?

21:13.740 --> 21:15.906
It's alright, Brian.
Those are just words.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.809
[imitating Willie]
It's alright Brian.
Those are just words.

21:19.746 --> 21:22.046
Alright, Duncan.
I've had my say.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.448
- Now, I'd like you to leave.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.317
Now that you know
what I do for a living

21:26.319 --> 21:28.419
I'm not good enough
to be in your house.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.454
Would you just leave?

21:30.456 --> 21:33.090
Why don't you<i> make</i> me?

21:33.092 --> 21:34.992
I would,
but I'm too civilized.

21:34.994 --> 21:38.729
Civilized? More like
sissified, hey, doofus?

21:39.632 --> 21:41.766
Oh, you are out of here!

21:41.768 --> 21:43.100
[grunts]

21:43.102 --> 21:44.902
[thud]

21:46.105 --> 21:47.905
Yay, mom!

21:47.907 --> 21:50.741
Let's hear it for
Kate Boom-Boom Tanner.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.511
Of course, you realize
what you did was wrong.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.979
Yeah, I know.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.916
It's true, Brian.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.752
In spite of what you've seen and
heard here in the last two days

22:01.754 --> 22:04.355
fighting is wrong.

22:04.357 --> 22:08.759
And don't argue with them,
or you'll wind up in the trash.

22:08.761 --> 22:12.163
Hey, Kate, when are you free
to mud wrestle Raquel?

22:14.300 --> 22:16.600
[instrumental music]

22:22.475 --> 22:24.542
In this corner

22:24.544 --> 22:28.279
weighing in at 14 ounces

22:28.281 --> 22:30.715
Mummy-Hamed Ali.

22:31.651 --> 22:34.518
And in this corner
weighing in at

22:34.520 --> 22:37.054
none of your business..

22:38.825 --> 22:42.193
...Gordon Sugar Ray Shumway.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.228
[imitating crowd cheering]

22:45.131 --> 22:46.330
Round one..

22:46.332 --> 22:47.798
Ding.

22:51.337 --> 22:53.337
Ow, low blow, low blow!

22:53.339 --> 22:56.674
Oh, what do you mean low blow?
He hit you in the nose.

22:56.676 --> 23:00.211
Anything below
my hairline is a low blow.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.014
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

23:04.016 --> 23:07.418
Oh, guess what? Bobby's not
picking on Brian anymore.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.819
In fact he's scared of him.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.688
Well, that's what happens
when your parents

23:10.690 --> 23:13.224
are He-Man and She-Ra

23:13.226 --> 23:15.326
masters of the neighborhood.

23:17.196 --> 23:18.929
Weren't you in
the middle of a bout?

23:18.931 --> 23:21.932
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna wrap
this one up, mummy.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.534
[laughing]

23:23.536 --> 23:25.603
Alright. Take that!

23:27.006 --> 23:29.707
Yeah, bet you didn't know
I could do that.
