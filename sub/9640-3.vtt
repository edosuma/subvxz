WEBVTT

00:07.440 --> 00:10.542
With my brave knight and
my hello pony blankie,

00:10.557 --> 00:13.463
The faster we go, the safer I feel.

00:20.437 --> 00:24.276
Oh, sweet, shining alex,
thou art the bomb.

00:25.111 --> 00:27.243
Right back at thou.

00:28.611 --> 00:30.177
Oops.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.319
You dropped your blankie, milady.

00:36.354 --> 00:38.823
Take it. It shall keep thee cozy.

00:38.857 --> 00:42.861
hey, justin. Why don't we invent an
edible flaming sandwich for kids?

00:42.896 --> 00:46.096
because I think most kids
like having their eyebrows.

00:46.130 --> 00:48.496
- Oh.
- Halt! Who goes there?

00:48.531 --> 00:49.664
I shall never let
danger touch milady.

00:49.698 --> 00:51.665
Not danger. Dorks.

00:53.435 --> 00:57.271
No one must know that I crush on thee.
I'm sorry, knight,

00:57.305 --> 01:00.273
But I must bid thee... Later.

01:01.908 --> 01:03.642
Literarium terrarium.

01:08.477 --> 01:10.345
I'm telling you,
there has got to be a way

01:10.646 --> 01:14.014
To put something on fire in
my mouth without it hurting.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.416
What are you doing in here?

01:18.619 --> 01:20.952
What does it look like
I'm doing in here?

01:20.986 --> 01:25.255
Uh... Trying to come up with an
answer to the question I just asked.

01:26.924 --> 01:29.426
Ok, you got me.
You win. Nice going.

01:29.460 --> 01:31.661
Heh-heh. We won.
I feel pretty good about that.

01:31.695 --> 01:35.264
- She's up to something.
- Yeah, we never win.

01:35.298 --> 01:38.260
* well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

01:38.294 --> 01:40.192
* that the end will no
doubt justify the means *

01:40.760 --> 01:42.493
* you can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

01:42.528 --> 01:44.227
* yes, please *

01:44.261 --> 01:46.062
* well, you might find out
it'll go to your head *

01:46.797 --> 01:48.031
* when you write a report
on a book you never read *

01:48.633 --> 01:50.500
* with a snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

01:50.535 --> 01:52.234
* that's what I said *

01:52.269 --> 01:55.204
* everything is not what it seems *

01:55.238 --> 01:58.973
* when you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

01:59.007 --> 02:02.808
* you might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

02:02.843 --> 02:07.043
* because everything
is not what it seems *

02:07.078 --> 02:10.513
* everything is not what it seems *

02:10.548 --> 02:14.415
* when you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

02:14.450 --> 02:18.152
* be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

02:18.186 --> 02:21.120
* because everything is not *

02:22.422 --> 02:24.089
* what it seems *

02:24.090 --> 02:27.490

02:27.943 --> 02:30.578
Alex, look! There's dean,
that guy you like.

02:32.414 --> 02:35.615
Should I get you a bullhorn so you
can announce it to the whole school?

02:35.749 --> 02:39.151
I don't want anyone to know. - Sorry,
but I just don't know what you see in dean.

02:39.185 --> 02:43.020
He's dangerous. He gives temporary
tattoos in the boys' bathroom!

02:46.425 --> 02:49.260
- Hey, dean.
- What's up?

02:49.294 --> 02:52.696
So, I hear your temporary tattoo
business has really taken off.

02:52.731 --> 02:54.765
Hey, joey, show her my portfolio.

02:57.167 --> 02:58.367
Bam!

02:58.402 --> 03:01.170
Hm. So, do you ever give
those to cute girls?

03:01.204 --> 03:03.805
What cute girl are
you thinking about?

03:03.839 --> 03:05.273
Harper.

03:08.742 --> 03:11.644
Uh, she's totally into it.
We'll get back to you on that, ok?

03:13.846 --> 03:17.882
I don't care how much you have a crush on
him. I'm not getting a temporary tattoo
from dean!

03:17.917 --> 03:20.083
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
I just panicked.

03:20.117 --> 03:25.187
What do you see in him,
anyway? He had a mustache all summer!

03:25.221 --> 03:28.523
Alex, red alert. Gigi and the
wannabes are heading this way.

03:30.759 --> 03:36.463
I can't believe it. It's after second
period and I haven't humiliated anyone
today.

03:36.497 --> 03:42.067
Look. Hey, everyone. Laura moloney is
moving into andy hollenbeck's locker.

03:42.101 --> 03:43.902
They're totally going out.

03:43.936 --> 03:45.603
We're just lab partners.

03:45.637 --> 03:47.404
We're just lab partners?

03:47.439 --> 03:49.472
You are embarrassed to
be going out with me.

03:49.507 --> 03:51.040
That's it. We're done.

03:54.744 --> 03:59.079
It's sick. It's like gigi gets a thrill out
of humiliating people just 'cause they like
someone.

03:59.114 --> 04:02.115
See? This is why no one can
know I have a crush on dean.

04:02.149 --> 04:04.650
He doesn't have a bedtime!

04:04.684 --> 04:07.418
I'm sorry. You just say his
name and these things pop up.

04:09.387 --> 04:12.288
Guess what, alex? We're having
a sleepover at cindy's tonight.

04:12.323 --> 04:14.223
And like always,
you're not invited.

04:14.491 --> 04:16.992
Gigi, how many times are you
gonna not invite me to something

04:17.027 --> 04:18.726
Before you realize I don't care?

04:19.327 --> 04:21.795
Well, if you don't care so much,
why did you crank call us last time?

04:23.864 --> 04:25.598
You can't prove that was me.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.234
Hey, justin, look what
I found in the lair.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.769
Alex has a book with hundreds
of drawings she made.

04:31.804 --> 04:35.205
That's lame. - Yeah.
Almost as lame as that book you have

04:35.240 --> 04:39.674
With the pictures of that
weather lady from channel nine.

04:39.708 --> 04:43.310
Her name is wendy leonard,
and her forecasts are extremely accurate.

04:45.980 --> 04:47.347
You know what?

04:47.381 --> 04:50.750
Dude, this isn't a book.
This is a magic journal.

04:50.784 --> 04:54.019
Alex has drawn herself an entire
fairy tale world that she lives in!

04:54.053 --> 04:57.155
Dude, she uses the literarium
terrarium spell to go inside of it!

04:57.189 --> 05:00.591
Wow. Look at all this
embarrassing princess-y stuff.

05:00.626 --> 05:03.194
Who knew alex was such a girl?

05:04.463 --> 05:06.297
It is pretty shocking.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.868
Oh, my gosh. There's gigi.

05:11.902 --> 05:13.402
Oh, brother.

05:13.436 --> 05:17.973
I usually don't notice girls
with soft, shiny hair,

05:18.007 --> 05:19.974
But it's like a field
of gold up there.

05:20.076 --> 05:22.977
Ok, dude, whatever you do,
don't show this to gigi.

05:23.011 --> 05:26.280
If alex didn't want us to see it,
there's no way she wants gigi to see it.

05:26.314 --> 05:29.149
Justin. Hi, max.
What you got there?

05:29.183 --> 05:32.886
It's alex's secret journal and pictures.
She's created drawings. Look.

05:35.122 --> 05:37.224
Like I said, don't show it to gigi!

05:37.259 --> 05:39.662
But justin, we hate alex
and gigi hates alex,

05:39.696 --> 05:41.464
So don't we want
to give it to gigi?

05:41.732 --> 05:44.101
There's a difference between
family hate and people hate.

05:44.135 --> 05:47.069
If someone in your family hates someone,
you're supposed to, too.

05:47.103 --> 05:50.237
Oh, I get it. Then I hate pumpkin
pie so you hate pumpkin pie.

05:50.271 --> 05:52.105
You know I love pumpkin pie!

05:53.307 --> 05:56.109
Max, could you carry
my books for me?

05:56.144 --> 05:57.811
Yes!

05:57.845 --> 06:00.146
Can I brush your hair, too?

06:01.382 --> 06:03.516
Is that weird?

06:04.752 --> 06:06.119
Yeah.

06:06.154 --> 06:08.654
It is, actually. That's ok.
I'll take my books back.

06:08.689 --> 06:12.391
Max, she just took alex's journal.
Oh, did I?

06:12.426 --> 06:14.694
I see it right there,
so I'm just gonna take it back.

06:14.929 --> 06:17.030
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Just hand it to me.

06:17.398 --> 06:19.665
- I'm popular so I can keep the book.
- Voice is being raised.

06:19.699 --> 06:22.869
- I get everything I want.
- Oh, whoa, max!

06:22.903 --> 06:25.270
I don't have my gym clothes on.
Go get her!

06:26.673 --> 06:29.039
Literarium terrarium!

06:34.377 --> 06:38.480
I got the book back. - Now how are
we gonna get her out of the book?

06:38.514 --> 06:42.349
Hey, I got the book back. Now you've
got to start pulling some weight.

06:44.518 --> 06:45.952
Hello?

06:45.986 --> 06:47.353
Hello!

06:47.388 --> 06:48.788
Is anybody here?

06:50.000 --> 06:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:59.732 --> 07:01.366
"alex's blankie?"

07:01.400 --> 07:03.668
Where am I?

07:06.373 --> 07:08.941
You're in alex's journal.

07:08.976 --> 07:10.977
I'm in alex's journal?

07:11.011 --> 07:14.314
Ok, I thought I was just reading
alex's journal. - Right.

07:14.348 --> 07:16.816
You're reading alex's journal.

07:18.118 --> 07:19.686
I'm alex's teddy bear.

07:21.522 --> 07:26.693
Stay on the pathways, and if you see any
stuffing that looks like this, it's mine.

07:26.727 --> 07:29.129
I'm so glad alex erased that dog.

07:31.399 --> 07:33.700
Ok, she has a teddy
bear and a blankie?

07:33.734 --> 07:36.068
She's not as tough as she
wants everyone to think.

07:36.102 --> 07:37.970
What else does she have in here?

07:38.005 --> 07:39.639
All her secrets.

07:39.673 --> 07:42.408
Oh, I'm so gonna keep reading.

07:42.442 --> 07:44.944
The school's gonna love
hearing stories about alex

07:44.978 --> 07:46.679
That I don't have to make up.

07:46.713 --> 07:49.215
You know what I'd love?
Some fiberfill.

07:49.249 --> 07:51.918
If you see alex,
tell her to draw me some.

07:51.952 --> 07:53.453
And maybe a hot tub.

07:53.487 --> 07:56.089
Wouldn't you just get
all wet and soggy?

07:56.124 --> 07:57.824
Hey, that's my problem.

07:57.859 --> 07:59.493
Just mention it to her.

08:09.003 --> 08:10.837
Hey, check out the wannabes.

08:10.871 --> 08:13.338
They're totally lost without gigi.

08:14.674 --> 08:16.374
Here's our chance
to mess with them.

08:17.710 --> 08:19.544
Hey, guys, where's gigi?

08:19.579 --> 08:21.746
We don't know where gigi is.

08:21.781 --> 08:25.983
Oh. Well, she's probably off getting
a jump on the new fashion trend...

08:26.017 --> 08:29.152
...Wearing shoes on your hands.

08:29.186 --> 08:32.254
And, uh, you guys should probably
do it too, or she'll get mad.

08:32.288 --> 08:34.789
Oh, thanks, alex.

08:36.292 --> 08:38.693
For an enemy, you are a lifesaver.

08:38.727 --> 08:42.097
Just because we're enemies
doesn't mean we don't care.

08:44.267 --> 08:46.201
Yeah, thanks.

08:47.437 --> 08:49.638
Gigi's also off getting
her head shaved.

08:49.672 --> 08:51.306
Do with that what you will.

08:59.646 --> 09:02.280
Yeah, right. How do we get
gigi out of the magic journal

09:02.315 --> 09:05.484
Without letting her know that
there is a magic journal?

09:05.518 --> 09:08.287
Well, I've given this
a lot of thought.

09:08.321 --> 09:10.189
Perfect. What do you got?

09:11.391 --> 09:12.658
That's it.

09:15.394 --> 09:18.129
- We gotta buy ourselves some time.
- Yes, yes, um...

09:18.163 --> 09:20.898
Where's a good hiding spot
for the journal? - I got it.

09:21.332 --> 09:24.701
You know how dad can always stare into the
fridge and never find the mustard bottle?

09:24.735 --> 09:26.769
He's, "we're out.
I can't make a sandwich!"

09:27.103 --> 09:29.939
And then mom's like, "
it's right in front of your eyes, jer."

09:29.973 --> 09:31.606
Oh, yeah, yes!

09:31.841 --> 09:36.010
So we'll use magic to turn alex's
book into dad's squeezable mustard!

09:37.446 --> 09:39.480
No.

09:39.515 --> 09:41.615
We gotta hide the
journal in plain sight.

09:41.649 --> 09:45.418
Aw, man, I was hoping we
could use a spell like...

09:45.452 --> 09:48.054
...Like bookus mustardo.

09:51.626 --> 09:53.626
Alex always steers
clear of a bookshelf,

09:53.660 --> 09:56.696
Plus, boom, it'll blend right in.
She'll never know.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.598
I think that's alex.
Act natural, act natural.

10:04.336 --> 10:07.037
Hey, guys. Did you notice that
gigi left school early today?

10:07.072 --> 10:10.073
I kind of missed her. Especially in pe.
We started dodgeball.

10:10.108 --> 10:13.009
And why is my journal on
the bookshelf by the door?

10:13.043 --> 10:16.745
- How did you see that?
- I knew it wouldn't work.

10:16.779 --> 10:19.714
Bookus mustardo! Bookus mustardo!
Bookus mustardo!

10:19.748 --> 10:22.083
You guys are toast.

10:22.117 --> 10:24.419
My journal is for my eyes only.
What do you know?

10:24.453 --> 10:27.722
That you have a crush on
dean "the tattoo" moriarty.

10:28.458 --> 10:29.692
I do not!

10:29.793 --> 10:32.260
And that we accidentally
trapped gigi in there.

10:32.295 --> 10:33.595
What?

10:33.629 --> 10:35.396
Gigi's in my journal?

10:35.430 --> 10:38.165
This is unbelievable.
This is my worst nightmare.

10:38.266 --> 10:41.702
All of my secrets are there and now gigi's
gonna know that I have a crush on dean.

10:41.736 --> 10:43.036
Knew it!

10:49.840 --> 10:53.577
Gigi hasn't talked to the knight who looks
like dean so she doesn't know about my
crush.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.480
I'm gonna go get her out before
she meets him. - No, you can't.

10:57.516 --> 10:59.917
She'll tell everyone she
was in a magical journal.

11:00.418 --> 11:03.319
They'll know we're wizards. - What do you
want me to do, leave her there forever?

11:03.520 --> 11:07.588
No! No, just give me some time to figure
out how to explain this to her when she
gets out.

11:08.791 --> 11:10.592
Fine. I'll give you one day.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.860
In the meantime,
nobody opens this book.

11:13.062 --> 11:16.230
As long as this book stays closed,
everything in my fantasy world freezes.

11:16.265 --> 11:18.966
I won't let her find out
any of my other secrets.

11:19.001 --> 11:20.701
- Like...
- Max, stop it!

11:30.076 --> 11:33.178
Listen... Nobody's crying!

11:33.213 --> 11:35.814
Gigi must not be in school again!

11:35.848 --> 11:40.150
Well, something tells me her
schedule must have been booked.

11:40.185 --> 11:42.486
That she's in a real binding.

11:42.520 --> 11:45.088
That she may be starting a
new chapter in her life.

11:46.123 --> 11:47.857
Why are you talking like that?

11:47.891 --> 11:50.291
Oh, it's really clever if you knew.

11:52.860 --> 11:53.893
Hey!

11:58.063 --> 12:00.431
I mean... That's good...

12:00.465 --> 12:03.734
...That you did what
gigi wanted you to do.

12:03.768 --> 12:05.635
I didn't think they'd do it.

12:05.669 --> 12:10.005
Gigi also told me she wants
you guys to wear yarn wigs.

12:10.040 --> 12:11.473
Yarn wigs?

12:11.508 --> 12:14.509
They exist. I can show
you how to make them.

12:14.543 --> 12:17.044
Now, that one you're
just making up.

12:17.078 --> 12:19.612
That's ridiculous.
Gigi would never say that.

12:19.647 --> 12:21.314
She hates yarn.

12:21.348 --> 12:23.080
How can you hate yarn?

12:23.115 --> 12:26.183
I wear a lot of yarn.
Then again, gigi hates me.

12:26.217 --> 12:28.651
It all makes sense now!

12:34.255 --> 12:38.257
Hey, justin, so I was looking at alex's
journal... - Where did yofind that?

12:38.292 --> 12:41.159
- She hid it in my hamper.
- Genius.

12:41.193 --> 12:46.496
You never open that thing. - I know. I
tripped over some clothes and I fell on it.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.864
Oh, quick. Alex is coming.
Hide it in plain sight.

12:53.769 --> 12:55.570
Hey, guys, what's up?

12:55.604 --> 12:57.504
it's working.

12:59.106 --> 13:02.841
No, it's not working.
What are you doing with my journal?

13:03.676 --> 13:04.809
I peeked.

13:04.843 --> 13:06.510
You opened it?

13:06.544 --> 13:08.645
That's what "peeked" means.

13:08.679 --> 13:13.216
Oh, no. Gigi's riding with
my knight on his motorcycle.

13:13.251 --> 13:16.051
He has his helmet on.
She doesn't know he looks like dean.

13:16.085 --> 13:19.387
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go in there and
get her out before she finds out.

13:19.422 --> 13:21.488
- Literarium...
- No, alex, you can't.

13:21.656 --> 13:23.822
I haven't figured out how to
keep her from exposing us.

13:24.357 --> 13:27.391
Yeah, well, gigi finding out about dean
is worse than finding out about magic.

13:27.426 --> 13:30.726
- Really?
- No, but it's important to me.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.160
Literarium terrarium.

13:35.594 --> 13:38.861
Ok, we gotta get going.
We gotta keep her from exposing magic.

13:40.730 --> 13:43.031
Literarium terrarium.

13:47.568 --> 13:50.937
- No, alex, stop. What are you trying to do?
- I'm trying to stop gigi.

13:50.971 --> 13:54.073
Here. Hold my veil. I don't want
it to get caught in the catapult.

14:00.947 --> 14:03.581
- That was close.
- It wasn't that close enough!

14:03.615 --> 14:06.584
Alex, as much as that was like,
totally awesome...

14:06.618 --> 14:10.122
Did you see that! It was like,
swoosh...!

14:14.296 --> 14:16.831
It's not the right way to
deal with the situation.

14:17.232 --> 14:20.602
Well, I've got to stop her before she finds
out I drew the knight to look like dean.

14:20.636 --> 14:23.038
Hey, I could joust her for him.

14:23.072 --> 14:27.308
Then, when I win, we could ride off
in the sunset and she'll never know.

14:27.342 --> 14:31.245
Joust? - Yeah. I've got jousting
stuff in the jousting shed.

14:31.279 --> 14:33.982
Oh. Your fantasy world
involves a lot of sharp metal.

14:34.016 --> 14:35.817
- Oh, thank you.
- Welcome.

14:39.020 --> 14:40.355
Ok.

14:45.396 --> 14:47.698
Let's take our mount and
chase down that evil gigi

14:47.732 --> 14:50.167
Before she unveils the
knight's true identity.

14:52.536 --> 14:55.871
- Hold on.
- Onward, my loyal bros.

14:55.905 --> 14:59.574
What are you doing? - This is how I
talk when I'm in my fantasy world.

14:59.608 --> 15:03.277
Oh, how awesome are thou and thee.

15:03.311 --> 15:05.613
See, this is why I
never draw you here.

15:11.585 --> 15:13.786
- Oh, there she is!
- drive faster!

15:13.821 --> 15:16.655
- I don't know the speed limit.
- Well, it's faster than this.

15:16.690 --> 15:18.323
My teddy bear's about to pass us.

15:19.558 --> 15:22.994
Stop! Stop! My stuffing's
caught in your chain.

15:31.169 --> 15:35.372
Pull over! Pull over, my unfair maiden,
and hand me back my blankie!

15:39.711 --> 15:42.078
Oh, alex, your journal
is so beautiful.

15:42.113 --> 15:44.080
- Thank you.
- And revealing.

15:44.115 --> 15:48.017
I've seen your hello pony blanket,
I've seen your teddy bear.

15:48.052 --> 15:51.990
I can't wait to see who the knight you're
crushing on is. - No, you're not gonna see
him.

15:52.024 --> 15:54.259
Because I challenge thou to a duel.

15:54.293 --> 15:58.930
A joust of sorts.
Well, actually, it is a joust.

15:58.965 --> 16:02.300
Whoever knocks the other off her iron
steed rides away with the knight,

16:02.335 --> 16:04.669
Sir lord of cuteness.

16:04.703 --> 16:07.037
Fine. Give me a lance
and I'll joust you.

16:07.072 --> 16:08.906
I've got one for you.

16:11.176 --> 16:14.678
- And a helmet for safety.
- Ow!

16:14.713 --> 16:17.682
Should have given you
the shin guards first.

16:39.907 --> 16:42.008
We should move or we're
gonna be shish-kabob.

16:42.142 --> 16:45.144
Are those the sticks with beef
or the sticks with chicken?

16:45.179 --> 16:48.114
It's meat with a stick through it.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.251
- Oh.
- Come on.

17:02.028 --> 17:03.996
Whoo!

17:04.797 --> 17:06.598
Yes! Whoo!

17:06.633 --> 17:08.099
It was great!

17:10.303 --> 17:13.003
Knight, knight! Let us
ride off into the sunset.

17:14.205 --> 17:16.807
- Not before a kiss.
- It's dean!

17:16.840 --> 17:19.611
It's dean!
Alex has a crush on dean!

17:19.645 --> 17:21.946
What? That is not dean!

17:21.981 --> 17:24.415
Dean is a lot taller than that.

17:24.451 --> 17:26.386
And his eyes aren't
even that color.

17:26.621 --> 17:28.956
Not just because I ran out
of that color pencil, either.

17:28.991 --> 17:31.727
Dean's eyes are blue or blue-green,
depending on the light.

17:31.761 --> 17:33.664
A beautiful blue-green.

17:34.866 --> 17:37.002
Ow! Something bit my toe.

17:37.036 --> 17:40.439
- Oh, those would be toe leeches.
- Toe leeches?

17:40.473 --> 17:44.410
It's my book. They started out as smudges,
but then I made them into something.

17:44.444 --> 17:46.345
Get me out of here!

17:46.379 --> 17:48.080
Oh, anything for you, my love.

17:48.114 --> 17:50.014
Literarium terrarium.

17:50.049 --> 17:52.082
What did you just do?

17:52.117 --> 17:55.151
- She wanted to get out.
- Of the pond!

17:55.186 --> 17:57.387
She's gonna tell everyone
that we're wizards.

17:57.421 --> 17:59.655
Forget about that.
What about my crush on dean?

17:59.823 --> 18:02.725
You gotta get over this kid.
He doesn't even have a library card!

18:02.759 --> 18:05.627
- Well, neither do I.
- Yes, you do.

18:05.661 --> 18:07.595
I signed you up for on

18:13.100 --> 18:15.766
Oh, hey, gigi. The wannabes
have been looking for you.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.534
Ah! Here it is. Alex's journal.

18:18.568 --> 18:21.670
That's alex's journal?
You better not look in there.

18:23.639 --> 18:25.907
Welli already did,
and I've seen everything.

18:25.941 --> 18:28.275
It's amazingly vivid.

18:30.344 --> 18:33.311
Gigi! Last thing you remembered,

18:33.345 --> 18:35.445
We were chasing after you
to get alex's journal,

18:35.480 --> 18:37.814
When you fell and
bumped your head. Boop!

18:39.349 --> 18:41.783
You were completely passed out,
talking all kinds of nonsense

18:41.817 --> 18:43.917
About being trapped
in a medieval world.

18:43.952 --> 18:47.718
But really you just had
a horrible concussion.

18:47.753 --> 18:51.520
And you, you were there.
And he was there.

18:51.555 --> 18:54.923
D I... Was there.

18:54.958 --> 18:57.224
What? I thought I was just
reading alex's journal

18:57.259 --> 18:58.992
And everything was totally vivid.

19:00.261 --> 19:02.795
That's exactly what
I'm trying to say.

19:02.830 --> 19:07.065
- Gigi, give me back my journal.
- No. Alex, you are so burned.

19:08.034 --> 19:11.102
Listen up, everyone.

19:11.136 --> 19:13.671
I found out at miss
"too cool to care" alex

19:13.705 --> 19:16.206
Has a journal full of
embarrassing secrets.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.708
- She's making this up.
- No, she's telling the truth.

19:19.743 --> 19:22.277
What are you doing? - I'm not
gonna give her the satisfaction.

19:24.979 --> 19:27.780
Ok, so gigi saw my journal.

19:27.814 --> 19:32.483
Where I draw pictures of
myself living like a princess

19:32.517 --> 19:37.454
In a castle with my hello
pony blankie, my teddy bear

19:37.488 --> 19:40.389
And a handsome knight who sure
looks a little bit like dean.

19:40.423 --> 19:42.391
But it could have en anybody.

19:42.425 --> 19:44.125
Oh, no, it could not have.

19:46.428 --> 19:48.962
See? Alex has a crush
on dean moriarty!

19:50.198 --> 19:52.532
Hey, I have a journal
with secrets in it.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.868
I'll admit it. I like
prending I'm a princess.

19:55.902 --> 19:59.137
But I'm also the kind of girl who
wouldn't be caught dead at prom,

19:59.171 --> 20:01.972
Unless it was a zombie prom and
we all dressed up like zombies.

20:02.007 --> 20:05.508
Oh, my gosh. I would so be
on the committee for that.

20:06.944 --> 20:10.478
Bottom line, I'm hard to
figure out. Deal with it.

20:10.512 --> 20:14.714
Yeah, and I have acrapbook with pictures
of the weather lady from channel nine.

20:14.749 --> 20:17.150
Deal with that!

20:19.386 --> 20:22.585
Seriously, you should keep that to yourself,
but thanks for trying.

20:25.355 --> 20:30.757
Ok, so from this point on, everybody in
this school is done being humiliated by
gigi.

20:30.792 --> 20:32.959
- Who's with me? Come on!
- I am!

20:40.115 --> 20:42.416
This is still my school.
Clear the halls.

20:50.357 --> 20:53.526
- Hi.
- Sorry if I embarrassed you.

20:53.561 --> 20:55.728
Nope. I liked it.

20:55.762 --> 20:58.062
The way you drew me,
I look pretty ripped.

20:58.096 --> 21:01.164
That's because you are ripped,
dean, yeah! - Oh, yeah!

21:01.199 --> 21:04.734
Thanks, guys.

21:04.769 --> 21:08.402
Gigi thought it looked like you,
but I'm not that great of an artist.

21:08.436 --> 21:12.136
I think you're pretty good,
russo. - At drawing?

21:12.170 --> 21:14.570
If that's what you want
to be talking about.

21:14.605 --> 21:16.371
Then, sure.

21:21.342 --> 21:23.075
Nicely done, alex.

21:23.110 --> 21:25.176
It always pays to be
proud of who you are.

21:25.211 --> 21:28.811
I mean, that's what I do and
everyone respects me for it.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.046
I respect you.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.879
I justamily hate you.

21:32.914 --> 21:34.881
I can live with that.

21:34.915 --> 21:36.782
You kinda have to.

21:36.816 --> 21:39.149
I know.

21:44.946 --> 21:47.915
I'm ready for my temporary
tattoo. Just do it!

21:47.949 --> 21:51.085
Harper, I told you, you didn't have
to do this if you didn't want to.

21:51.119 --> 21:53.186
No, I have to prove
something to myself.

21:53.221 --> 21:56.389
I have to conquer my fear.
Do it, dean, just do it.

21:56.423 --> 21:58.757
He plays video games
with parental warnings!

21:59.859 --> 22:02.427
Oh, it's so cold.
Get it off, get it off!

22:02.461 --> 22:06.196
No, come on, come on.
Two more seconds, two more seconds.

22:06.230 --> 22:08.798
And we're done.

22:08.833 --> 22:11.500
Does it make me look too tough?

22:11.535 --> 22:14.536
I don't know. It's the
first unicorn I've done.

22:16.238 --> 22:18.072
Nah, I think it looks good.

22:18.107 --> 22:21.409
Dean, you said I could
have the unicorn!
