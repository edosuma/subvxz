03:47.840 --> 03:50.142
Her mother is dead.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.559
and ensure that she is in receipt

03:57.560 --> 03:59.479
of all that is due to
her as a child of mine.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.239
That is simply impossible.

04:01.240 --> 04:05.465
What is right... can
never be impossible.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.759
She is black.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.319
She is my blood.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.879
But she is black.

04:09.880 --> 04:13.309
A detail you chose not
to share with us.

04:13.680 --> 04:17.759

to the Indies on a longitude experiment.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.279
After that, who knows?

04:20.279 --> 04:23.359
It is not in my gift to question
the King and his Royal Navy.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.679

04:26.680 --> 04:29.879
- Sir.
- I am the Lord Chief Justice.

What has she been named?

04:44.520 --> 04:48.188
She is Belle. After her mother.

04:49.200 --> 04:53.505
Dido Elizabeth Belle Lindsay.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.239
She takes your name?

04:56.240 --> 04:58.349
I am not ashamed.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.742
We will call her Dido.

05:04.560 --> 05:07.079

You should not always insist on

08:19.600 --> 08:24.542
So... now we have 2 nieces

08:25.000 --> 08:29.066
Well, Elizabeth was in

We shall say that, in accordance

08:36.520 --> 08:39.426
she is entitled to live
beneath this roof.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.741
That is the nature of order.

And where in that order
should her color be placed?

Above or below her
Murray bloodline?

08:56.120 --> 08:58.582
- Marriage?
- Impossible.

08:59.120 --> 09:02.839
Any match her 'other origins'
would attract would...

to leave me not a thing...

11:04.440 --> 11:06.742
and he obliges her.

11:11.120 --> 11:15.106
I think he might have loved
me more if mama had not died.

11:16.440 --> 11:22.065

- I will do your hair, Bette.

rank to dine with the servants...

12:23.320 --> 12:26.624
and too low to dine with my family?

12:27.680 --> 12:31.985
Dinner with guests is a
formal proceeding, Dido.

12:32.600 --> 12:37.239
We simply can't impose upon visitors
our disregard of those formalities.

12:37.240 --> 12:40.225
But... am I not wealthy now?

12:40.840 --> 12:44.399

that changes matters.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.479
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

20:30.480 --> 20:32.782
(TAPPING)

20:44.320 --> 20:46.439
ELIZABETH:
A portrait? Are you sure?

20:46.440 --> 20:48.919
Yes. Aunt Mary has confirmed it.

20:48.920 --> 20:51.399
Good Lord, how truly wonderful.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.399
- But...
- But what?

20:53.400 --> 20:57.466
Papa, should he not have wished
to see me before deciding?

20:58.680 --> 21:01.301
Sorry, I did not know you...

21:01.360 --> 21:03.839
LORD MANSFIELD: Mr. Davinier, I believe
you've already had the pleasure.

21:03.840 --> 21:07.508
In some way, yes. Miss Lindsay.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.799
Decide what?

21:11.800 --> 21:15.999
If he should... should
want to paint me.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.759
The man is to be paid a fortune.
What is there to decide?

21:18.760 --> 21:23.668
You are simply to sit still, Dido.
Not a very challenging task.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.319
Next to Elizabeth?

21:25.320 --> 21:28.464
As you always are,
right beside each other.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.879
Should not any lady be flattered
to be such a subject?

21:31.880 --> 21:33.519
How should any male
know the ways of a lady

21:33.520 --> 21:35.879
when he has not even mastered
the ways of a gentleman?

21:35.880 --> 21:39.559
Quite. Though one should be
forgiven for thinking...

21:39.560 --> 21:41.159
he is in the presence of a lady

21:41.160 --> 21:42.799
when she is, in fact,
still a juvenile.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.879
- Papa! May we do this in private?
- No, not now.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.865
You may take the books
back to the library.

21:53.040 --> 21:56.399
LORD MANSFIELD: Upon the death of
her husband, a widow may receive...

21:56.400 --> 21:59.359
her marriage portion and
her inheritance at once.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.159
She has 40 days to leave
her husband's home.

22:02.160 --> 22:05.159
Mr. Davinier, what is the purpose
of the law, in your eyes?

22:05.160 --> 22:08.079
To provide certainty where
there otherwise might be none.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.381
Example?

22:10.160 --> 22:12.906
The <i>Zong</i> ship and those drowned.

22:16.680 --> 22:20.839
The law is one of the few trades
acceptable to a gentleman.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.759
JOHN: I have little...

22:22.760 --> 22:24.399
but where my father
relies on the Bible,

22:24.400 --> 22:25.919
I wish to rely on the law courts.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.919
And you aspire to the judiciary?

22:27.920 --> 22:29.079
One day, yes, my Lord.

22:29.080 --> 22:34.420
I wish to make the laws, for that is
how I may truly change this world.

22:35.240 --> 22:38.191
That is I... I mean to say...

22:39.440 --> 22:41.868
make it a better place.

22:42.040 --> 22:45.423
LORD MANSFIELD:
You have grand ambitions.

22:46.600 --> 22:51.588
A country lawyer you may make if you
pay attention to what you are taught.

22:52.440 --> 22:57.279
But you have neither the rank
nor the finances for any more.

22:57.280 --> 23:00.265
Well if I may, my Lord,
neither did you.

23:00.280 --> 23:02.582
I beg your pardon?

23:03.120 --> 23:04.421
Well...

23:04.960 --> 23:07.103
as a fourth son...

23:07.400 --> 23:09.719
you had rank but not the income

23:09.720 --> 23:12.079
to pay for your
qualification to the Inns.

23:12.080 --> 23:14.559
Without the sponsorship of Lord
Foley and William Hamilton...

23:14.560 --> 23:17.599
the English courts might not have
benefited from your brilliance...

23:17.600 --> 23:22.542
and the title Lord Chief Justice
could not be yours today... my Lord.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.639
And you think you are worthy
of such considerations?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.519
Of that I do not know, my Lord,

23:29.520 --> 23:32.439
but I do know that a country
life does not suit me.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.741
LORD MANSFIELD: Dido...

23:34.440 --> 23:39.109
the Reverend Davinier has asked me
to take his son under my tutelage.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.590
What do you think?

24:00.200 --> 24:02.628
Thank you for your
gracious support.

24:03.760 --> 24:07.199
I neither spoke for or against
you since neither is my place.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.946
Silence speaks volumes.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.039
ELIZABETH: Papa's new student.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.879
Mr. Davinier...
my cousin, Elizabeth.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.199
A pleasure.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.679
Papa has never taken a
pupil, you realize?

24:18.680 --> 24:22.279
Someone to keep you company while
you take papa's dictation, Dido.

24:22.280 --> 24:27.347
Truth is, there have been more men here
this week than I've seen in my entire life.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.021
Hopefully we have not disappointed.

24:30.040 --> 24:32.024
On the contrary.

24:41.320 --> 24:44.146
Mr. Davinier, what...

24:44.720 --> 24:47.519
what is the importance of the <i>Zong?</i>

24:47.520 --> 24:52.382
Why is the case before papa's
court, the Supreme Court?

24:52.400 --> 24:53.701
Well...

24:54.080 --> 24:56.064
it is a ship.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.703
I am aware of that.

25:00.240 --> 25:04.226
It is... a human cargo ship.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.261
Oh.

25:06.680 --> 25:11.986
It... it lost most of its slaves
before arriving at its destination.

25:13.920 --> 25:17.906
Drowned by the crew,
on the captain's orders.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.589
But... why?

25:21.440 --> 25:24.559
Miss, your supper is served
now in the ladies' parlor.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.225
Thank you.

25:28.280 --> 25:31.584
Will you be joining us for
dinner, Mr. Davinier?

25:35.040 --> 25:37.879
Uh... Thank you, madam,
but I am promised to

25:37.880 --> 25:40.639
the company of my
aunt this evening.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.022
Very well, as you wish.

25:47.360 --> 25:49.708
Permit me to ask, but...

25:51.640 --> 25:54.479
why do you not dine
with your family ever?

25:54.480 --> 25:56.319
That is not correct.

25:56.320 --> 26:00.919
Forgive me but twice now I have seen
you separated from the gathering.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.479
I am confounded.

26:02.480 --> 26:03.599
And well you might be...

26:03.600 --> 26:07.950
when the son of clergy is permitted to
the table before a lady of the house.

26:08.640 --> 26:11.359
Is that a reminder of my place?

26:11.360 --> 26:14.311
No. It is a statement of mine.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.065
(EXHALES)

26:56.880 --> 26:58.944
(SOBBING)

27:30.480 --> 27:32.305
(NEIGHING)

27:35.080 --> 27:38.839
<i>JOHN: 132 drowned en route from
Africa to the West Indies.</i>

27:38.840 --> 27:42.079
Your ruling could bring the
slave trade to its knees...

27:42.080 --> 27:45.399
entirely destroying an economic
foundation of this land.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.239
Is that pressure not
maddening, my Lord?

27:48.240 --> 27:51.749
<i>"Justitia fiat, ruat
coelum</i>, " Mr Davinier.

27:52.080 --> 27:55.827
"Let justice be done, though
the heavens may fall."

27:56.240 --> 27:58.279
The insurance claim states

27:58.280 --> 28:01.399
the slaves were thrown overboard
for the safety of the ship.

28:01.400 --> 28:05.559
That there wasn't sufficient water
to survive the rest of the voyage.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.919
- It does.
- Then, if I'm correct, the case hangs on...

28:07.920 --> 28:10.199
it hangs on 'absolute necessity'.

28:10.200 --> 28:14.039
If the killing of the negroes
was truly necessary...

28:14.040 --> 28:17.359
to save the ship, as
the captain contends.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.959
But is that where it hinges?

28:19.960 --> 28:22.740
No man happily
disposes of his cargo.

28:23.440 --> 28:27.119
Let me ask you: were
you to enter a port...

28:27.120 --> 28:32.108
with barely one piece of merchandise
left to trade, what would you do?

28:32.400 --> 28:37.103
Swallow financial ruin or seek
recompense from your insurer?

28:40.080 --> 28:42.064
With due respect...

28:42.800 --> 28:47.424
I should question whether human life
should be insurable as cargo at all.

28:51.640 --> 28:56.423
A gentleman rather like him
once showed me great interest.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.999
Mr. Davinier?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.479
Really, Mary?

28:59.480 --> 29:01.942
Well, don't look at me like that.

29:02.840 --> 29:05.461
It was my mama who intervened.

29:06.120 --> 29:09.469
I thought he had a very
great sense of duty.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.119
A little over-kind at times but...

29:12.120 --> 29:13.990
LADY MANSFIELD:
He is engaged, you know?

29:14.800 --> 29:16.639
- ELIZABETH: Is he?
- Engaged.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.519
LADY MANSFIELD:
Mr. Beresford's daughter.

29:18.520 --> 29:22.825
The carriage-maker? He might have
set his sights a little higher.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.759
ELIZABETH: I do love roses.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.427
LADY MANSFIELD: Everything's
a little late this year.

29:49.320 --> 29:52.359
For it is the power of
God unto salvation...

29:52.360 --> 29:55.664
so sayeth Christ the Lord. Amen.

29:56.880 --> 29:59.421
Hymn number 76.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.870
Mr. Davinier.

30:48.440 --> 30:49.741
Wait.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.429
I was curious.

30:58.720 --> 31:02.581
Quite a task... to sit
for so many hours.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.711
Of course.

31:07.280 --> 31:11.062
I appear the only one to have
just learned of the <i>Zong</i> case.

31:11.640 --> 31:14.399
Perhaps yours is a life less
concerned with such matters.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.270
Why do you judge me so?

31:17.120 --> 31:22.790
It is a fact that I have contemplated
on the matter for many hours and I...

31:24.280 --> 31:26.439
I do not think the
slaves could have been

31:26.440 --> 31:27.479
drowned in the way that you say.

31:27.480 --> 31:28.759
(SCOFFS)

31:28.760 --> 31:31.631
Are you at utter disconnect
from everything?

31:32.720 --> 31:34.624
Mr. Davinier, please.

31:34.840 --> 31:36.141
(SIGHS)

31:37.640 --> 31:40.068
Tell me what you know.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.871
Tell me.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.941
Do not render me your amusement.

31:52.760 --> 31:55.239
I can only tell you what I believe.

31:55.240 --> 31:59.147
And what... what is that?

32:06.680 --> 32:09.665
The slaves were thrown
into the waters...

32:10.280 --> 32:13.231
chained together as one.

32:14.680 --> 32:16.823
They were diseased...

32:17.360 --> 32:22.985
worth more as dead insured merchandise,
than as alive spoiled goods.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.266
Miss Lindsay...

32:27.520 --> 32:30.199
But the insurers are appealing?

32:30.200 --> 32:33.663
They are refusing to pay
for murdered slaves.

32:40.880 --> 32:42.670
Thank you.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.639
You told her they were
wantonly drowned?

32:56.640 --> 33:00.879
They were diseased, but it was essential
that they die on the journey...

33:00.880 --> 33:03.559
or they would not come under
the insurance consideration.

33:03.560 --> 33:07.639
Neither, too, if they had expired of their
diseases. That is why they were killed.

33:07.640 --> 33:11.079
You have taken advantage of
confidential matters afforded you.

33:11.080 --> 33:15.829
These 'matters' have been for
public consumption for months.

33:16.040 --> 33:19.159
Miss Lindsay is
no child... no fool.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.199
Her precious care is in my hands...

33:21.200 --> 33:24.039
and I will decide when she is
ready for such realities...

33:24.040 --> 33:26.468
not the son of a vicar!

33:30.440 --> 33:31.839
I will gather my belongings.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.380
Do so.

33:43.360 --> 33:45.742
Your Lordship, a question.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.227
Well?

33:47.720 --> 33:49.959
As the mere son of a vicar...

33:49.960 --> 33:55.221
I wonder whether the value you extend
to your very precious mulatto niece...

33:55.520 --> 33:59.119
amounts to the Â£30 insurance

33:59.120 --> 34:02.344
the traders are asking for
each life they murdered?

34:03.640 --> 34:05.479
Good day, my Lord.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.020
Mr. Davinier...

34:08.199 --> 34:11.239
find yourself in her
vicinity again...

34:11.239 --> 34:16.262
and I will make you rue the
day you ever set eyes on me.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.505
(DOOR CLOSES)

34:23.120 --> 34:26.105
ELIZABETH: John Davinier is
leaving very early today.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.518
(DOOR OPENING)

34:31.520 --> 34:33.060
(DOOR CLOSING)

34:58.000 --> 35:00.999
There you are. We are requested.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.799
You: drawing room. I relegated
to the ladies' parlor.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.479
We are to attend
London for the season.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.959
(GASPS)

35:08.960 --> 35:11.831
We are to finally 'come out'?

35:12.080 --> 35:14.303
Elizabeth is to come out.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.744
Dido is not.

35:17.160 --> 35:18.519
But... why?

35:18.520 --> 35:22.039
LORD MANSFIELD: You understand the
ways of the world for a female, Dido.

35:22.040 --> 35:23.719
Elizabeth has no income.

35:23.720 --> 35:27.599
You are to meet as many gentlemen as
possible before we make the match.

35:27.600 --> 35:31.799
When all this has gone to her father,
there'll be nothing left for her.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.399
And... me?

35:33.400 --> 35:35.399
LADY MANSFIELD:
Any gentleman of good breeding...

35:35.400 --> 35:39.279
would be unlikely to form a
serious attachment to Dido.

35:39.280 --> 35:43.187
And a man without would lower
her position in society.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.759
ELIZABETH:
She's not merely my cousin, Mama.

35:47.760 --> 35:49.999
- Papa, please.
- She is my sister.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.999
These are the keys of the house.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.039
I cannot attend London without her.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.342
They have hung at your
aunt's waist for 30 years.

35:56.360 --> 35:59.999
I am not Lady Mary.
I am not an unwanted maid.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.639
Lady Mary is too old to continue
in charge of the house.

36:03.640 --> 36:06.679
You may take up your
duties on your return.

36:06.680 --> 36:10.109
Lord knows I'll need the two of you
to keep each other out of trouble.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.143
Are you punishing me?

36:18.040 --> 36:20.024
LORD MANSFIELD: Punishing you?

36:21.480 --> 36:23.703
You are most cherished.

36:24.720 --> 36:26.704
Most loved.

36:48.760 --> 36:51.381
I'm so very sorry.

36:59.880 --> 37:03.104
ELIZABETH: Do you think I
may see Mr. James in town?

37:03.360 --> 37:04.821
Perhaps.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.304
I could fall in love
with such a man, Dido.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.027
Love?

37:11.480 --> 37:13.225
Hmm.

37:14.960 --> 37:18.159
Bette, you shall feel
no such sentiment...

37:18.160 --> 37:21.782
for you shall either end
poor or broken-hearted.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.624
(PEOPLE CHATTING INDISTINCTLY)

37:35.840 --> 37:37.959
ELIZABETH:
Aren't you quietly relieved...

37:37.960 --> 37:39.559
that you shan't be at the caprice

37:39.560 --> 37:41.828
of some silly Sir and his fortune?

37:49.240 --> 37:51.781
The rest of us haven't the choice.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.959
Not a chance of inheritance
if we have brothers...

37:55.960 --> 38:00.424

it is said all of the ship's

59:32.880 --> 59:34.479
I found these in papa's library.

59:34.480 --> 59:36.305
What are they?

59:39.360 --> 59:42.140
Papa's notes on the ship's log.

59:42.320 --> 59:45.199
It seems the first mate
has come forward with it

59:45.200 --> 59:47.946
one Mr. Stubbs.

59:48.840 --> 59:50.639
I could not find the log itself

59:53.040 --> 59:55.159
See the map positions.

the ship past no less than 8 ports...

- Good Lord.
- And they did not.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.942
They either ignored the possibilities
or they were never in need.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.504
This is remarkable.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.119
Perhaps if you could

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.359
make these facts
known, Mr. Davinier.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.439

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.759
by ignoring it, it
somehow escapes me.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.540

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.185
not by blood.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.542

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.222

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.039
I feel ashamed.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.342
Do not feel ashamed.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.903
Elizabeth said something
when we arrived in London.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.279
"We women are but the
property of gentlemen."

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.839
But it came into my
head that I have been

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.586
blessed with freedom twice over.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.940
As a negro and as a woman.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.279
I suppose you have.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.866
Or have I?

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:46.110
Must not a lady marry even
if she is financially secure?

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.959
For who is she without a
husband of consequence?

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.199
It seems silly... like a free negro

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.839
who begs for a master.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.141
Well...

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.265
unless... she marries her equal.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.262
Her true equal.
A man who respects her.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.940
I remember my father's eyes.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.465
They were kind, gentle.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.502
- A little like yours.
- Mine?

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.267
I mean... in color.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:26.905
He showed me much love though
I only knew him a few hours.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.630
What of your own mother?

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.359
I know very little of her

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.519
other than the color

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.981
she has given me.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.945
Well then, at least you
know she was beautiful.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.502
I am to marry... shortly.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.101
Oh.

He is amiable and of good family.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.866
Is it... what you want?

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.199
The alternative is
to replace Lady Mary

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.999
in her responsibilities at Kenwood.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.159
But she's a spinster.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.079
Papa did not trust I
could achieve a match

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.986
that would raise my
rank or even equal it.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.906
You are above reducing
yourself for the sake of rank.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.268
I pray he would marry you
without a penny to your name...

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.270
for that is a man who
would truly treasure you.

And wealthy?

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.919
What if he is suitable but you
do not feel 'yourself' with him?

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:09.020
Oh, Dido. He understood me.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:14.799
And whenever he looked at me I
somehow felt better in this world.

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.759
I am convinced his
affections are growing

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.759
and I feel certain of my own love.

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.639
Oh, stop it! It is not love.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.749
You stop it.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:27.547

than I myself, do you?

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.749
Do you, Dido?

Oh, most certainly.

you have ensnared my brother.

Tell me, are you to share his

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.959
Oh, Mr. James, your manners are as
poor as your brother's finances.

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.959
And you are foolish enough to
marry him. I, on the other hand...

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:47.264
have no further use for
your impoverished cousin.

I'm not certain he is ready
to go against the traders.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.599
They are some of the most
powerful in these isles...

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.439
and theirs are the finances that
hold up England, after all.

is destroyed, we shall blame you.

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:30.399
religion not being the only
guardian of our morality.

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.799
Of course not. There is
self-responsibility.

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:36.119
And failing that, does
the law not have a duty?

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:41.399
Does the Bench and Parliament not have
a duty to uphold and create the laws...

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.639
that progress our
morality not retard it?

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:48.959
If not to protect us from others
then to protect us from ourselves.

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:54.079
Laws that allow us to diminish the
humanity of anybody are not laws.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:56.279
They are frameworks for crime.

01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:01.119
I do not care if you, as an individual,
are without character or conscience.

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:04.359

find for the traders...

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:04.199
you will be formalizing in law the

No. Never again.

Then allow me to take the reins.

LORD MANSFIELD:
Now let me be clear...

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:18.346
the loss of water on a ship constitutes
a singularly dangerous affair.

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:24.279
Insurrection of thirsty
and hostile slaves...

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.719
<i>at its extreme, and
an impossible task...</i>

<i>to share diminished water reserve
amongst all those living, at best.</i>

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:40.079

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.425
these were not the
circumstances of the <i>Zong</i>.

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:18.589
Slaves were not jettisoned
because water supplies ran low.

01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:25.150
Indeed, evidence shows the
ship sailed past 8 ports...

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:29.359

My finding is that the slaves...

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:40.319
were jettisoned, killed, because
the <i>Zong</i> ship's owners...

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:45.262
chose a tight packing fashion
to transport their slaves.

01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:49.599
They knew the risk since this
fashion of transportation...

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:54.588
