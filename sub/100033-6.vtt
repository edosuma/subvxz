WEBVTT

00:13.709 --> 00:15.450
Whoa.

00:15.493 --> 00:18.844
I don't think I've seen
the ED this quiet since...

00:18.888 --> 00:21.064
I don't think I've ever seen
the ED this quiet.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.370
- Could be the new moon.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.763
- Or because NYU's
on spring break.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.591
- I'd say I hope it stays
like this for you,

00:26.635 --> 00:28.158
but I know you're a masochist.

00:28.202 --> 00:31.074
- Uh, no, not anymore.
I've changed.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.120
- Mm.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.356
- Incoming!

01:37.575 --> 01:40.578
32-year-old woman,
restrained passenger in MVA.

01:40.622 --> 01:41.927
A van hit an embankment.

01:41.971 --> 01:44.147
02 sats in the 80s
and dropping.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.235
- Okay, she may need
to be tubed.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.280
I'll get an airway box.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.238
Casey,
draw up etomidate and sux.

01:48.282 --> 01:51.285
- We got this.
One, two, three.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.420
- Okay,
let's bag her with 100% O-2.

01:56.464 --> 01:57.682
- Looks like
a class two airway.

01:57.726 --> 01:58.814
- Incoming!

01:58.857 --> 02:00.859
- Okay,
use a rapid sequence technique.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.209
Casey, when you finish,

02:02.252 --> 02:03.862
get a 12 lead EKG
and a stat portable chest.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.473
- You got it.

02:05.516 --> 02:07.388
- Restrained passenger in MVA.
- Man, I was good and asleep

02:07.431 --> 02:09.607
and then all of a sudden, boom!

02:09.651 --> 02:12.915
Glass was flying everywhere
and whatnot.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.351
- Let's get her to bay 27.
- God bless...

02:14.395 --> 02:17.180
just trying to get
an early start

02:17.224 --> 02:18.529
back home to Alabama.

02:18.573 --> 02:19.617
- Okay, ma'am.

02:19.661 --> 02:20.792
- We were at this
church convention.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.925
- Ma'am.
- Oh, no, excuse me.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.274
- Ma'am.
- I am not a ma'am.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.842
I am a Miss.
Miss Verdene.

02:26.885 --> 02:28.670
- Miss Verdene, well,
I am Dr. Bloom,

02:28.713 --> 02:29.975
and this here is
Nurse Brunstetter.

02:30.019 --> 02:31.803
And they're gonna take care
of your lacerations.

02:31.847 --> 02:32.804
- Okay, thank you.

02:32.848 --> 02:34.458
- Okay, let's expose the skin,

02:34.502 --> 02:36.373
irrigate the wounds,
and set up a suture tray.

02:36.417 --> 02:37.853
- Yeah.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.594
- This is Kaye Henry,
restrained driver of the van.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.335
Airbag deployed resulting
in chemical burns

02:41.378 --> 02:42.771
and a bleeding nose.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.947
- We're from Holy Gethsemane
Christian Fellowship.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.862
Everybody from our group
has insurance.

02:46.905 --> 02:48.559
- That's okay.
- No, we can pay.

02:48.603 --> 02:50.822
- Well, today, I am fixing
broken noses for free.

02:50.866 --> 02:52.084
Bay 24.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.261
- 40-year-old woman
in respiratory arrest.

02:54.304 --> 02:55.784
- Seriously?
Let me guess.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.394
Restrained passenger in MVA.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.527
- Please, somebody help her!

02:59.570 --> 03:01.833
Can someone please help
with her leg?

03:01.877 --> 03:04.227
Please, please, someone.

03:04.271 --> 03:05.533
Please, please,
don't let her die.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.752
Mariana?
Mariana, bay 26.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.624
Pneumothorax,
let's place a chest tube.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.496
- Someone, please, please,
help her.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.455
Please don't let her die.
Lottie's got babies at home.

03:14.498 --> 03:15.891
- All right.
All right.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.240
- Why's it so hard?
- Okay, ladies, I need for you

03:17.284 --> 03:18.850
both to breathe for me, okay?

03:20.896 --> 03:23.507
- Turan, compartment syndrome.

03:23.551 --> 03:26.858
Measure lower right extremity
for anterior pressure.

03:26.902 --> 03:29.034
- I'm not getting a good seal.

03:29.078 --> 03:31.036
- Mariana,
angle the tube posteriorly

03:31.080 --> 03:32.429
for better blood evacuation.

03:32.473 --> 03:33.604
- Yes.

03:33.648 --> 03:34.866
- Okay, Nurse Jackson.
- I'm right here.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.259
- Nurse Jackson,
let's get this going.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.391
Where's my cane?

03:37.434 --> 03:38.914
All right, how you feeling,
Kaye?

03:38.957 --> 03:39.958
- Okay.
- Good?

03:40.002 --> 03:40.959
- Yeah.

03:41.003 --> 03:41.960
- Okay,
keep that--that's right.

03:42.004 --> 03:43.005
That's right.

03:43.048 --> 03:44.398
- Chest pressure's equalizing.

03:44.441 --> 03:46.574
- Great.
- Bloom, leg pressure's 40.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.793
- Okay, do a fasciotomy
using the two incision

03:48.837 --> 03:49.881
four compartment technique.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.622
I need my cane.
- Ow, it hurts.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.015
- All right, Kaye.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.799
First time you've broken
a bone?

03:54.843 --> 03:56.366
- Yeah.
- All right.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.716
- This is gonna hurt,
hopefully not too much.

03:58.760 --> 03:59.717
- Okay.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.980
- Auntie Kaye.
- Chante!

04:02.024 --> 04:03.373
That's my niece.
- Kaye.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.374
You need to relax.
- I need to get to her.

04:04.418 --> 04:05.723
- Auntie Kaye, where are you?

04:05.767 --> 04:06.942
- Restrained passenger
in the MVA.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.900
She has chest bruising
from the seatbelt.

04:08.944 --> 04:10.685
- My chest really hurts.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.034
- Okay, we're gonna take a look
at that.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.905
Let's move Chante to a side bay

04:13.949 --> 04:16.038
and get chest x-rays,
both PA and lateral.

04:16.081 --> 04:17.300
- Okay.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.432
- She's been sick
the last few days.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.303
Nausea, vomiting.
- Kaye, I got her.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.739
I promise.

04:21.783 --> 04:22.784
The best way for you
to take care of her right now

04:22.827 --> 04:24.046
is to take care of yourself.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.917
All right?
You need to rest.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.311
- Alfreeda Watson,
54-year-old...

04:28.355 --> 04:29.617
both: Restrained passenger
in MVA.

04:29.660 --> 04:30.879
- Got it.
- Her leg was trapped

04:30.922 --> 04:32.228
under the seat in front of her.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.535
- Okay, Ms. Watson,
does your--does your leg hurt?

04:34.578 --> 04:35.797
- Well, it ain't childbirth,

04:35.840 --> 04:37.929
but I 'spose it does
ache a touch.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.366
Now, I'm not one to complain,

04:39.409 --> 04:41.498
but I think that New York is
tired of all us ladies

04:41.542 --> 04:42.630
here from Alabama.

04:42.673 --> 04:43.805
- Uh, bay 28.

04:43.848 --> 04:46.721
Let's get some x-rays
and page Kapoor.

04:46.764 --> 04:47.939
Looks like nerve damage.
- Dr. Bloom?

04:47.983 --> 04:49.027
Dr. Bloom.
- Yes?

04:49.071 --> 04:50.246
Yes?

04:50.290 --> 04:54.468
- Your nurse cut
my blouse--brand new blouse

04:54.511 --> 04:55.599
clean off of me.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.035
- And I've apologized
several times.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.994
- Okay, Miss Verdene--
- It was a final call sale.

04:59.037 --> 05:01.605
Now, what are they gonna do
about that?

05:01.649 --> 05:02.911
They're stitching up my face.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.042
They're gonna stitch up
my shirt.

05:04.086 --> 05:05.348
- Uh, Brunstetter,
what have you got?

05:05.392 --> 05:07.132
- Sister Mary Joseph node.

05:07.176 --> 05:08.786
- Good find.
Okay, let's page Sharpe.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.353
- Bloom,
pressure's bottoming out!

05:10.397 --> 05:11.485
- I'm gonna be right back.
- What?

05:11.528 --> 05:13.400
- Someone, I need my cane.

05:13.443 --> 05:15.402
- Restrained passenger,
hit her head during an MVA.

05:15.445 --> 05:16.968
- And this fool done put
an ice pack on it.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.970
- You're in pain.
- But the damn thing leaked.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.885
It's full of all kinds
of fake-ass chemicals.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.191
- Okay,
we're gonna irrigate your head,

05:22.234 --> 05:23.540
make sure all the chemicals
are washed away.

05:23.584 --> 05:24.889
- Irrigate?
Oh, no, ma'am.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.543
This is not wet and wild hair.
- Brunstetter!

05:26.587 --> 05:27.805
- Okay, this is
Nurse Brunstetter,

05:27.849 --> 05:28.850
and they're gonna take
great care of you.

05:28.893 --> 05:29.851
- Bloom.
-  Ooh.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.113
I can't wait
to get back home.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.375
- Take a look at this.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.812
She's hemodynamically unstable.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.814
- SVT.
We need to cardiovert her.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.381
Come on.

05:38.425 --> 05:41.123
- She's in defib.
Charged.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.646
- Clear.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.866
- Go again,
increase to 150 joules.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.128
- Charged.
- Clear.

05:47.695 --> 05:50.480
- We have sinus rhythm.
- Back to normal rhythm.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.830
- Blood pressure's rising.

05:52.874 --> 05:55.006
- All right,
vitals are stabilizing.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.487
- Casey, pull up the portable
chest X-ray that you did.

06:00.534 --> 06:01.970
- What are you thinking?

06:02.013 --> 06:04.755
- EKG is showing low voltage
in the lateral leads.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.193
Cardiac tamponade,
probably from that right there

06:08.237 --> 06:09.194
on the chest X-ray.

06:09.238 --> 06:10.805
- What?
- There's a shadow.

06:10.848 --> 06:11.936
- Contusion?

06:11.980 --> 06:13.503
- It's more like a mass.

06:13.547 --> 06:14.983
Let's put Zoll Padz
on her chest

06:15.026 --> 06:16.637
to shock her heart
back to a regular rhythm

06:16.680 --> 06:18.856
next time it goes off
and page Reynolds.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.906
- If one were more
conspiratorially minded,

07:08.950 --> 07:11.474
one might think that you were
actually trying to avoid me.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.389
-  Uh-uh.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.478
- Rough night?
- You could say that again.

07:15.522 --> 07:18.307
- Well, surely not because
of this adorable munchkin.

07:18.350 --> 07:21.310
- Yeah, well, to her credit,
it does take commitment

07:21.353 --> 07:23.747
to sustain six straight hours
of screaming.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.357
- Well, like her father,

07:25.401 --> 07:26.489
it would appear that
she's only content

07:26.533 --> 07:27.534
inside a hospital.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.361
- Yeah, cruel, cruel irony.

07:29.405 --> 07:30.362
- Let me help.

07:30.406 --> 07:31.494
I mean, after work,

07:31.538 --> 07:32.669
I could take her
for a couple of hours,

07:32.713 --> 07:34.062
give you some me time.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.498
- That's very kind,
but I couldn't ask that of you.

07:35.542 --> 07:36.847
- What if I insisted?

07:36.891 --> 07:38.240
- Yeah, thanks anyways,

07:38.283 --> 07:39.676
but we kind of got
a whole system going.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.592
So we're good...
for the most part.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.425
- You're right,
looks like a mass.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.471
Well, based on the size,
she's had it for a while.

07:51.514 --> 07:52.907
Any of these women know
her health history?

07:52.950 --> 07:54.865
- Not that I can figure out.
- Where'd you want me?

07:54.909 --> 07:56.563
- Sister Mary Joseph node
in bay 29.

07:56.606 --> 07:57.738
- Let's take her up.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.609
- Dr. Bloom, point me.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.959
- Uh, bay 28, nerve damage.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.703
- Okay, Ms. Watson,
I'm Dr. Kapoor.

08:06.747 --> 08:09.445
I realize it might not
look this way now,

08:09.489 --> 08:12.753
but you ladies really were
lucky,

08:12.796 --> 08:15.407
considering that there were
so many of you in the van.

08:15.451 --> 08:16.887
- So because I'm a black woman,
I must be

08:16.931 --> 08:19.368
with all the other black women
you got up in here?

08:20.543 --> 08:22.676
- No, that--not--that's not
what I...

08:22.719 --> 08:23.894
what I meant was--

08:23.938 --> 08:26.418
- Relax, I'm with them.

08:26.462 --> 08:28.420
But you should see your face.

08:28.464 --> 08:29.813
It's like you caught
a spirit or something.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.685
- Is that a bad thing?

08:31.728 --> 08:33.600
- Depends on what you say
about my foot.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.039
- Well,
your foot is not broken,

08:38.082 --> 08:40.302
but the swelling is troubling.

08:40.345 --> 08:41.738
- Yeah, well,
that's nothing new.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.088
As long as I can walk
my fields, I'm fine enough.

08:44.132 --> 08:45.394
- You're a farmer?

08:45.437 --> 08:47.352
- Fourth generation, soybeans,

08:47.396 --> 08:49.093
when the foot isn't giving me
the blues.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.661
- Have you seen a doctor
about this?

08:51.705 --> 08:53.097
- You doctors want
so much out of pocket,

08:53.141 --> 08:54.795
and I make too much
for Medicaid.

08:54.838 --> 08:58.712
So I figure I just ride it out
until I qualify for Medicare.

08:58.755 --> 09:01.062
- Unfortunately, riding it out
is not an option.

09:01.105 --> 09:03.804
I need to ask a colleague
to evaluate it further.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.632
Have a good day.

09:11.463 --> 09:13.465
- I know you.
What's your name?

09:13.509 --> 09:14.466
- Dr. Sharpe.

09:14.510 --> 09:16.773
- No, no, that isn't it.

09:16.817 --> 09:17.992
Dr. Helen.

09:18.035 --> 09:20.516
You come on
after my stories sometimes.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.952
Don't play.
- Okay, yes.

09:21.996 --> 09:24.781
I knew it, Dr. Helen.

09:24.825 --> 09:26.087
Fancy cancer doctor.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.393
Oh, wait.

09:28.437 --> 09:30.352
Are you here
because I got cancer?

09:30.395 --> 09:31.745
- Verdene,
you don't have cancer.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.094
- Miss Verdene.

09:33.137 --> 09:35.139
- Miss Verdene,
you don't have cancer.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.967
- You gonna swear
on them chunky earrings

09:37.011 --> 09:38.360
you love wearing?

09:38.403 --> 09:40.405
- No, they're not that big,
are they?

09:42.712 --> 09:44.801
Miss Verdene, may I?

09:44.845 --> 09:47.412
This reddish lump...
- Mm-hmm.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.501
- Next to your belly button
is rather concerning.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.547
It indicates an infection
in your lymph nodes.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.855
- So what's that mean?
Antibiotics, a cream?

09:54.898 --> 09:56.334
- I'm afraid it's not
that simple.

09:56.378 --> 09:57.988
The infection's being
complicated by your diabetes.

09:58.032 --> 10:01.818
- I got diabetes too?
Talk about buzzard luck.

10:01.862 --> 10:04.386
My father lost a foot to sugar.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.518
- When was your last checkup?

10:06.562 --> 10:09.652
- Well, they closed
the nearest hospital to me.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.480
Take me at least an hour
to get to one.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.656
Now, who got time to drive
to two hours

10:13.700 --> 10:17.051
round trip on top
of an appointment?

10:17.094 --> 10:19.444
- Hmm.

10:23.187 --> 10:25.668
Miss Verdene.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.583
I'm gonna go get my colleague
to come and see you.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.889
- Why?

10:28.932 --> 10:30.455
- I think you just had
a seizure.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.069
Vijay.
- Oh, good.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.898
I have a black female,
54, farmer, dry sense of humor,

10:37.941 --> 10:40.552
presenting asymptomatic
lower extremity edema.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.554
- Black female, 52,
restaurant worker,

10:42.598 --> 10:43.686
cutting fashion sense,

10:43.730 --> 10:45.079
presenting
with petit mal seizures

10:45.122 --> 10:46.515
and untreated diabetes.

10:46.558 --> 10:49.126
- Okay.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.998
- All right, I'm gonna need
a sternotomy tray,

10:51.041 --> 10:52.869
a sternal saw,
and hand me the echo.

10:52.913 --> 10:56.960
- ♪ Feel discouraged

10:57.004 --> 10:58.832
- What is that?

10:58.875 --> 11:00.529
- No idea what she's singing.

11:00.572 --> 11:01.878
- ♪ Should the shadows

- Oh,
she was almost to the bridge.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.078
- You're interested in learning
to become a surgeon today,

11:28.122 --> 11:29.471
Dr. Duke?

11:29.514 --> 11:32.082
- She was singing--
- Get your head in the game.

11:32.126 --> 11:34.171
Ten blade, please.
Thank you.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.608
- We are ecstatic
to be considered

11:36.652 --> 11:37.697

11:37.740 --> 11:39.220
Believe me.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.570
It's just that to come
in--for us to in come tomorrow,

I don't know my--um,

11:43.267 --> 11:45.052
I don't know
my husband's schedule, really,

and I don't wanna spring
anything on him--

11:46.793 --> 11:48.272
on his schedule, I mean.

11:51.014 --> 11:53.234
Oh, I see.

11:53.277 --> 11:54.844
I see.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.237
No.
No, no, no, no.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.934
No, if tomorrow at 4:00 is
the only time you have,

11:57.978 --> 12:00.110
then we will make it work
on our end.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.591
Right.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.201
Yes, thank you.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.160
No, we look forward
to meeting you.

12:06.203 --> 12:07.770
Okay.

12:12.035 --> 12:14.298
Well done, Iggy.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.692
Hi, Chante,
I'm Doctor Frome.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.780
I work here at the hospital.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.651
- Is it finally my X-ray time?

12:19.695 --> 12:23.264
- No, it is not
finally your X-ray time,

12:23.307 --> 12:26.093
because I have one
or two questions

12:26.136 --> 12:28.225
that I'd like to ask you first,
if that's okay with you.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.227
- Where's your white coat?

12:30.271 --> 12:32.708
- The white coat, um,
I don't know.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.275
You know, I haven't worn
that thing in a long time,

12:34.318 --> 12:36.190
because I find that it makes
people feel more comfortable

12:36.233 --> 12:37.931
when I don't wear it.

12:37.974 --> 12:41.804
Plus, if I'm being honest,
I'm a super messy eater.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.327
- So lame.

12:43.371 --> 12:44.764
- You're crazy.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.287
- You're definitely not
the first person

12:46.330 --> 12:47.288
to tell me that.

12:47.331 --> 12:48.768
- So when's the X-ray?

12:48.811 --> 12:50.160
- Well, Chante,

12:50.204 --> 12:53.642
um, we can't give you an X-ray,

12:53.685 --> 12:55.775
because you are pregnant.

12:57.037 --> 12:59.082
We give a blood test to women
who don't know

12:59.126 --> 13:01.781
if they're pregnant
before we give them an X-ray.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.828
Because an X-ray can harm
the fetus.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.310
Do you understand what it means
to be pregnant?

13:09.353 --> 13:12.008
- I have a baby in me?

13:12.052 --> 13:13.793
Am I in trouble?

13:13.836 --> 13:15.229
- No, you're not in trouble.

13:15.272 --> 13:16.839
No,
you're not in trouble at all.

13:16.883 --> 13:20.190
Um, did you know
that you were pregnant?

13:20.234 --> 13:23.106
- Maybe.
- Did you plan this?

13:25.239 --> 13:29.156
Um, was the sex consensual?
Did you want to have sex?

13:29.199 --> 13:31.593
- Who doesn't wanna have sex?

13:31.636 --> 13:34.291
I like sex.
Do you like sex?

13:34.335 --> 13:37.686
- Do I like sex?
Um, sure.

13:37.729 --> 13:40.776
- Sex is great.
Wow.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.865
- Yeah, okay.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.736
- Okay, yeah.
That's healthy.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.390
There's nothing wrong
with liking sex.

13:46.434 --> 13:49.741
I just need to make sure
that nobody did anything to you

13:49.785 --> 13:51.265
that you didn't want.

13:51.308 --> 13:52.657
- I wanted to,

13:52.701 --> 13:54.224
and my boyfriend was
a scaredy-cat.

13:54.268 --> 13:55.747
He forgot the condom.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.272
- Yeah,
condom's pretty important.

13:58.315 --> 13:59.795
Let me ask you this.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.929
Do you have a plan
with your pregnancy?

14:04.365 --> 14:06.062
- I want an abortion.

14:09.109 --> 14:11.633
- Do you understand
what that means?

14:11.676 --> 14:14.854
- I don't wanna--I don't wanna
have a baby.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.337
- Sorry
for the impromptu music.

14:20.381 --> 14:22.078
My mom used to sing
"His Eye is on the Sparrow",

14:22.122 --> 14:23.601
like, every Sunday.

14:23.645 --> 14:26.996
Yeah, after church, it was
laundry, singing, and folding.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.432
- Angle that light for me.

14:28.476 --> 14:31.131
- She was choir section leader
before she got sick.

14:31.174 --> 14:34.090
The altos, music, church,
it meant a lot to her.

14:34.134 --> 14:36.049
- Dr. Duke, I am fully aware
of the relationship

14:36.092 --> 14:37.920
between black women and church.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.661
They're everywhere
but the pulpit.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.358
My mom doesn't let me
miss a Sunday,

14:41.402 --> 14:42.925
but that's on Sunday.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.274
- Can I have
the cardioplegic solution

14:44.318 --> 14:45.972
sent down?

14:49.062 --> 14:51.368
- Ah, damn it.
- What's wrong?

14:51.412 --> 14:53.153
- The mass causing
the tamponade has grown

14:53.196 --> 14:54.284
through the chamber wall.

14:54.328 --> 14:55.720
Where is the echo I asked for?

14:55.764 --> 14:57.026
- On its way
from Hastings' surgery.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.375
- Get it here now.

14:58.419 --> 14:59.942
- Can you do a resection
to remove it?

14:59.986 --> 15:01.074
- The way it's positioned
posteriorly,

15:01.117 --> 15:02.814
I have to remove the heart
entirely

15:02.858 --> 15:03.946
and then resect the mass.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.817
- And then put the heart
back in?

15:05.861 --> 15:08.472
- Prep the SCS bath
on the back table.

15:15.175 --> 15:17.307
Ms. Henry, I'm Dr. Goodwin.

15:17.351 --> 15:20.180
I just wanted you to know
that everyone in your group

15:20.223 --> 15:23.313
has stabilized except
for Tamala Robeson.

15:23.357 --> 15:25.750
- Her family's so worried.
How is--

15:25.794 --> 15:26.969
- Whoop, you okay?
- I'm fine.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.144
- Why don't we take a seat?
- I'm fine.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.624
- Why don't we have a seat?

15:29.667 --> 15:30.973
- No, I'm fine, really.
- Why don't we have a seat?

15:31.017 --> 15:32.148
- Tell me about Tamala.

15:32.192 --> 15:33.976
- There was a complication.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.456
During surgery,
we found a tumor,

15:35.499 --> 15:37.066
and it was there
long before the crash,

15:37.110 --> 15:40.374
but it has penetrated
her heart.

15:40.417 --> 15:41.375
So there's a number of things
we can do,

15:41.418 --> 15:42.811
but I need you to understand

15:42.854 --> 15:47.033
that your friend is facing
a very high-risk operation.

15:47.076 --> 15:50.819
- Well, it's covered.
Anything she needs is covered.

15:50.862 --> 15:53.953
I organized our trip.
It's all right here.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.128
Look.

15:55.171 --> 15:56.999
When we rented the van,

15:57.043 --> 15:59.306
we paid for the personal injury
insurance.

15:59.349 --> 16:01.003
I've read the policy,
there's no limit.

16:01.047 --> 16:05.094
So she's entitled to
the best care you can offer.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.053
- Hmm.
- The very best.

16:07.096 --> 16:10.360
And I made everyone pay
the extra $7.50

16:10.404 --> 16:11.361
for the insurance.

16:11.405 --> 16:12.928
They carried on a while, but--

16:12.972 --> 16:14.321
- Well, I'm sure
they're thanking you now.

16:17.063 --> 16:21.763
- Dr. Goodwin, would you be
open to praying with me?

16:23.112 --> 16:26.942
- Um, I'm not really the most

16:26.986 --> 16:29.162
prayerful of guys.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.820
Sure.

16:40.564 --> 16:44.438
- Heavenly father
from whom all blessings flow.

16:44.481 --> 16:48.094
It was your will to work
through this accident.

16:48.137 --> 16:50.009
Bless the hands
of these surgeons

16:50.052 --> 16:51.923
as they do your work.

16:51.967 --> 16:55.536
We are your instruments, Lord,
prayerful or not.

16:55.579 --> 16:58.365
Bless us and show us the way.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.806
Lucky the accident happened
so close to us.

17:04.849 --> 17:05.937
- Mm.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.852
Some are calling it
an act of God.

17:07.896 --> 17:08.940
- What do you think?

17:08.984 --> 17:10.855
- Well, I know is that

17:10.899 --> 17:12.161
half these women came in
with a host

17:12.205 --> 17:13.858
of preexisting conditions,

17:13.902 --> 17:16.383
diabetes, cervical cancer,
hypertension.

17:16.426 --> 17:18.559
And then they crash
right when they need care most.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.300
I don't know.
I'm a cynic.

17:20.343 --> 17:23.564
I mean, maybe it was
divine intervention.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.522
- Yeah.

17:25.566 --> 17:28.221
Maybe there was
an intervention.

17:28.264 --> 17:30.266
I just don't know
if it was divine.

17:51.418 --> 17:52.723
- Is there an update?

17:52.767 --> 17:54.464
- Uh, no update.

17:54.508 --> 17:58.599
I just, uh...do you mind
if I sit?

18:01.906 --> 18:06.607
Um...I met this woman once,

18:06.650 --> 18:09.914
and the amazing thing
about her was that

18:09.958 --> 18:14.397
she loved her friends...
more than anything.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.488
And her friends were
in trouble,

18:18.532 --> 18:19.707
through no fault of their own.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.752
They couldn't get the care
that they needed.

18:21.796 --> 18:26.496
So she decided that she was
gonna help her friends...

18:27.932 --> 18:29.717
No matter what.

18:32.154 --> 18:35.723
So she did something dangerous.

18:35.766 --> 18:38.465
And I would never tell you
her name,

18:38.508 --> 18:42.425
because I don't wanna
get her in trouble.

18:44.558 --> 18:47.735
Because I respect her.

18:47.778 --> 18:50.564
- I expect
she appreciates that.

18:53.567 --> 18:57.440
- But I do have a question
for her.

19:00.008 --> 19:03.316
How did things get so bad

19:03.359 --> 19:05.056
that the only way she saw
to save her friends

19:05.100 --> 19:07.755
was to crash their van?

19:14.153 --> 19:18.418
- Perhaps it's what
this woman saw.

19:18.461 --> 19:22.857
She had a friend who used to
love going for walks.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.730
Now she can't breathe.

19:26.774 --> 19:29.690
One's in and out
of a wheelchair,

19:29.733 --> 19:31.822
another died too early.

19:34.085 --> 19:37.828
This woman sees it all,
sees her friends at church,

19:37.872 --> 19:41.571
praying for the hospitals
to return,

19:41.615 --> 19:44.618
for money to buy medicine,

19:44.661 --> 19:48.709
for deliverance slow to come.

19:48.752 --> 19:52.191
So maybe she prays
for something different,

19:52.234 --> 19:56.673
for the strength to act,

19:56.717 --> 19:59.633
for a sign,

19:59.676 --> 20:01.504
and she gets nothing.

20:04.072 --> 20:08.729
Until a nice young man
at a van rental office

20:08.772 --> 20:13.603
offers to sell her supplemental
injury insurance.

20:15.997 --> 20:20.828
You spend your life wondering
what salvation will cost,

20:20.871 --> 20:25.659
and the answer turns out to be
$7.50.

20:27.095 --> 20:32.970
All I had to do was
one scary thing...

20:33.014 --> 20:36.235
And all our prayers were
answered.

20:36.278 --> 20:40.064
"So do not fear,
for I am with you.

20:40.108 --> 20:44.765
"Do not be dismayed,
for I am your God.

20:44.808 --> 20:48.986
"I will strengthen
and help you.

20:49.030 --> 20:53.904
I will uphold you
with my righteous right hand."

20:55.819 --> 20:58.169
- Meaning God will see you
through?

20:58.213 --> 21:00.215
- Meaning sometimes

21:00.259 --> 21:03.436
you wait for the right hand
of God,

21:03.479 --> 21:07.004
but sometimes the hand is you.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.751
- So me losing my concentration
is me having a seizure?

21:14.795 --> 21:15.970
- In some cases.

21:16.013 --> 21:18.494
Petit mal seizures present
in different ways.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.496
- And this is
from the diabetes too?

21:20.540 --> 21:22.846
- Uncontrolled diabetes
puts you at a high risk

21:22.890 --> 21:24.631
for strokes and other diseases.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.981
You should not drive until
you get this under control.

21:27.024 --> 21:28.765
- Well, if I can't drive,
how am I supposed to get

21:28.809 --> 21:29.897
to a doctor for help?

21:29.940 --> 21:30.941
- A church member
can't drive you?

21:30.985 --> 21:32.508
- An hour each way?

21:32.552 --> 21:33.901
- Perhaps family?

21:33.944 --> 21:37.296
- No one I can rely on.
I'm always bailing them out.

21:39.776 --> 21:41.038
- So what am I dying of?

21:42.997 --> 21:44.564
- Miss Alfreeda,
you're not dying.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.174
- Tell that to your face.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.004
- The swelling in your leg,

21:50.047 --> 21:52.789
we thought that it might be
cancer or a blood disorder,

21:52.833 --> 21:53.834
but it's neither.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.879
It's your kidneys.
They're failing.

21:55.923 --> 21:57.272
- So I am dying.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.580
- Well, your GFR is 16,

22:00.623 --> 22:02.930
which means that the creatinine
isn't clearing

22:02.973 --> 22:04.018
from your kidney,

22:04.061 --> 22:05.802
which means you need
a new kidney.

22:05.846 --> 22:07.717
- Well, it's a good thing
I brought a spare.

22:09.284 --> 22:12.722
- Well, you did bring a vanload
of potential donors.

22:12.766 --> 22:15.116
- You want me to take a kidney
from one of my church members?

22:15.159 --> 22:17.727
- A blood relative
would be better, though.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.120
Do you have any family?

22:20.730 --> 22:23.690
- No, I don't have any family
here.

22:23.733 --> 22:26.693
- Stop telling tales.
I'm her much younger sister.

22:26.736 --> 22:29.609
- Right.
I forgot about her.

22:29.652 --> 22:31.001
- See--you see how she is?

22:31.045 --> 22:32.307
I was gonna do
the Christian thing

22:32.351 --> 22:34.004
and offer up one of my kidneys,

22:34.048 --> 22:36.050
but I ain't doing it now
unless she asks

22:36.093 --> 22:37.138
for once in her life.
- Nobody is asking you

22:37.181 --> 22:38.269
for anything.

22:38.313 --> 22:39.662
- Like, when I helped you keep

22:39.706 --> 22:41.142
Mom and Daddy's farm last year.

22:41.185 --> 22:42.665
Go ahead, tell the truth.
Shame the devil.

22:42.709 --> 22:44.275
- You know what?
That's right, baby sister.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.930
Go on, keep Christ
in your heart and your kidney,

22:46.974 --> 22:48.715
because I don't want nothing
from you.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.851
- We'll have only two hours
for this.

22:54.895 --> 22:56.549
Why is that, Dr. Duke?

22:56.592 --> 22:58.638
- Because we're harvesting
the patient's own heart.

22:58.681 --> 23:00.335
After two hours,
the organ will degrade

23:00.379 --> 23:01.684
beyond viability.

23:01.728 --> 23:03.033
- And the mass?

23:03.077 --> 23:06.210
- Is presenting posterior
as a left atrial mass.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.821
- And I can resect it
with clean margins

23:07.864 --> 23:10.345
in about 45 minutes,
maybe another 45

23:10.389 --> 23:11.868
to restructure
the heart muscle.

23:11.912 --> 23:13.043
- That leaves you
with 30 minutes

23:13.087 --> 23:15.219
to sew it back in
and warm the trunk.

23:15.263 --> 23:16.873
Is there enough time for that?

23:16.917 --> 23:18.788
- Sitting about
4 degrees Celsius.

23:18.832 --> 23:21.008
- Okay.

23:21.051 --> 23:22.270
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

23:22.313 --> 23:24.054
listen up.

23:24.098 --> 23:28.189
Now this may be
an atypical surgery for us,

23:28.232 --> 23:31.235
but what is typical is
our efficiency

23:31.279 --> 23:33.324
and our precision.

23:33.368 --> 23:35.892
So use them today,

23:35.936 --> 23:37.981
and we may have a chance
to save a life.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.722
Okay?

23:39.766 --> 23:41.071
Let's get after it.

23:41.115 --> 23:42.812
- You're fully on bypass.

23:42.856 --> 23:44.901
- SVC partial dissection
complete.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.079
- Transecting
the ascending aorta.

23:52.343 --> 23:54.607
- Pulmonary artery clamped
and dissected.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.609
- Aortic cross-clamp off.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.219
- Removing the heart.

23:58.262 --> 24:00.221
- Resection tray
right behind you.

24:00.264 --> 24:01.657
- Heart is on the move.

24:08.359 --> 24:10.144
Start the clock.

24:19.458 --> 24:23.070
- Pregnant?
Chante, you pregnant?

24:23.113 --> 24:24.811
- Yes, ma'am.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.640
- Is it Mario?

24:27.683 --> 24:28.945
What'd I tell you
about messing around

24:28.989 --> 24:30.773
with that fast-ass boy?

24:30.817 --> 24:32.253
The baby.

24:32.296 --> 24:35.299
Is the baby okay?
What with the accident...

24:35.343 --> 24:39.086
- The fetus is totally unharmed
as far as we can tell.

24:39.129 --> 24:42.219
Thank you, Jesus.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.830
Okay.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.442
Okay.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.792
We're gonna figure this out.

24:49.836 --> 24:52.491
- I don't wanna be a mommy.

24:52.534 --> 24:55.058
- Oh, baby.

24:55.102 --> 24:57.408
I know it may seem scary
right now,

24:57.452 --> 25:00.063
but Auntie Kaye will be
right here.

25:00.107 --> 25:01.848
I took care of you, didn't I?

25:01.891 --> 25:03.153
We'll get through this.

25:03.197 --> 25:05.460
- Ms. Henry.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.723
Chante has expressed
more than not wanting

25:07.767 --> 25:08.898
to be a mother.

25:08.942 --> 25:10.421
- Meaning?

25:10.465 --> 25:12.162
- Well, why don't we let Chante
take this opportunity

25:12.206 --> 25:14.338
to share her feelings?

25:16.732 --> 25:18.517
- I want an abortion.

25:23.391 --> 25:25.741
- Did you put her up to this?

25:25.785 --> 25:27.830
- No, but she is
clearly articulating

25:27.874 --> 25:30.267
her choice to end
this pregnancy.

25:30.311 --> 25:32.182
- Then she should have
clearly articulated

25:32.226 --> 25:33.967
that I am her legal guardian,

25:34.010 --> 25:36.012
and I am in charge
of her decisions,

25:36.056 --> 25:37.536
including her medical ones.

25:37.579 --> 25:38.928
- Okay.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.495
I--you need to know
that I'm just here

25:40.539 --> 25:42.802
in support of Chante
and what she wants.

25:42.845 --> 25:45.021
And it seems like
this pregnancy

25:45.065 --> 25:46.501
would be a burden.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.459
- Because you think we couldn't
care for this baby?

25:48.503 --> 25:49.939
- That's not what I'm saying--

25:49.983 --> 25:52.376
- We are more than capable
of taking care of our own.

25:52.420 --> 25:55.205
Every child born
into this family is loved

25:55.249 --> 25:57.730
and extremely well
taken care of.

25:57.773 --> 26:00.167
Chante's child will be
no different.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.256
- But is that what's best
for Chante?

26:02.299 --> 26:04.867
- Based on what,
your 45 minutes of knowing her?

26:04.911 --> 26:06.129
- No.

26:06.173 --> 26:07.827
- Folks always want you
to make a choice,

26:07.870 --> 26:09.350
then look at you funny
when you don't make the choice

26:09.393 --> 26:10.830
they wanted you to make.

26:10.873 --> 26:14.137
One side shakes their heads,
saying you're oppressed,

26:14.181 --> 26:16.096
the other filled
with so called "Christians"

26:16.139 --> 26:17.358
who don't give a damn
as soon as the baby

26:17.401 --> 26:19.186
gets pushed out.

26:19.229 --> 26:21.231
But let's be clear.

26:21.275 --> 26:23.494
This black family right here

26:23.538 --> 26:26.846
ain't being co-opted
for anyone's crusade.

26:28.935 --> 26:31.154
- Oh, Max!

26:32.286 --> 26:34.767
What about if I got you
a food service?

26:34.810 --> 26:36.029
- Don't need it.

26:36.072 --> 26:37.160
- It would take the pressure
off of cooking.

26:37.204 --> 26:38.988
- Luna's still bottle feeding,
so...

26:39.032 --> 26:40.337
- Not for the baby, for you.

26:40.381 --> 26:41.817
- Oh.
- Be my treat.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.166
- Yeah, I'm good.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.472
I eat most of my meals
at the hospital anyway.

26:44.515 --> 26:45.429
Have you tried
the pretzel and hummus combo?

26:45.473 --> 26:47.431
It's very--
- Max.

26:47.475 --> 26:48.955
- I'm good.

26:48.998 --> 26:50.521
- Why won't you let me
help you?

26:50.565 --> 26:51.827
- You know what?
How 'bout this?

26:51.871 --> 26:53.786
When I need your help,
I'll ask for it.

26:53.829 --> 26:56.832
- Speech therapist
to distro four.

26:56.876 --> 26:59.487
Speech therapist
to distro four.

27:02.316 --> 27:04.274
- How's our group?

27:04.318 --> 27:07.495
- Most are recovering,
and we've got aftercare plans

27:07.538 --> 27:09.236
for the noncritical ladies--

27:09.279 --> 27:10.977
- Are you the medical director?

27:12.152 --> 27:14.545
- Is this about
my unpaid parking tickets?

27:14.589 --> 27:17.113
- We're following up
on the accident on the FDR.

27:17.157 --> 27:19.333
I'm Detective Grove.
This is Detective Vasquez.

27:19.376 --> 27:22.466
- Oh, why don't we discuss
this outside?

27:22.510 --> 27:23.990
- We'd like to have
a conversation with the driver,

27:24.033 --> 27:25.295
Kaye Henry.

27:25.339 --> 27:26.819
- Well, she's recovering.

27:26.862 --> 27:28.821
- If she's awake and conscious,
we wanna talk to her.

27:28.864 --> 27:30.431
- And if she isn't, we'll wait.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.100
- Kaye, the police are here
to speak to you.

27:48.971 --> 27:51.278
You understand there will be
repercussions

27:51.321 --> 27:54.107
if they find out the crash
was intentional.

27:54.150 --> 27:56.109
- And the only option is
to tell the truth.

27:56.152 --> 27:58.459
So what are you saying?

27:58.502 --> 28:01.027
- That I don't want you
to go to jail

28:01.070 --> 28:03.986
or your friends to lose
their insurance.

28:06.902 --> 28:09.035
- But they didn't do
anything wrong.

28:09.078 --> 28:10.863
They don't even know
what I did.

28:10.906 --> 28:13.169
- It doesn't matter.

28:13.213 --> 28:16.129
Deliberate actions negate
the policy you purchased.

28:22.222 --> 28:24.050
- For a while there,

28:24.093 --> 28:26.530
I really thought I was doing
God's will.

28:28.184 --> 28:32.319
But this and Chante...

28:33.537 --> 28:36.671
I was all wrong.

28:39.500 --> 28:43.025
Now it's time to do right,
Dr. Goodwin.

28:43.069 --> 28:46.507
This isn't in my hands,
never was.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.683
- Kaye, what are you gonna
tell the police?

29:09.225 --> 29:12.925
- I continue to be thrilled
that I am an only child.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.188
- What do you mean?

29:15.231 --> 29:17.016
- Verdene and Alfreeda letting
decades old personal drama

29:17.059 --> 29:18.365
get in the way of their health.

29:18.408 --> 29:20.584
- Will it kill Alfreeda to ask?
It's a kidney.

29:27.287 --> 29:28.941
- But why offer someone
something

29:28.984 --> 29:30.420
and then make them ask for it?

29:30.464 --> 29:31.987
- Asking isn't such a big deal.

29:32.031 --> 29:33.989
- So it makes perfect sense
that Alfreeda could die

29:34.033 --> 29:35.425
while Verdene keeps
her kidney hostage,

29:35.469 --> 29:36.992
waiting for her to ask for it?

29:37.036 --> 29:37.993
- It's about respect.

29:38.037 --> 29:39.125
Verdene has sacrificed

29:39.168 --> 29:40.387
her own health,
swooping in to help

29:40.430 --> 29:41.954
her entire family,
never getting

29:41.997 --> 29:43.216
a word of praise.

29:43.259 --> 29:44.652
- I'm sure no one ask her
to be their savior.

29:44.695 --> 29:45.914
She's doing it
for the attention.

29:45.958 --> 29:47.220
- That's not true.
- Of course it is.

29:47.263 --> 29:48.351
She's gotta be the bride
at every wedding

29:48.395 --> 29:49.483
and the corpse
at every funeral.

29:49.526 --> 29:51.528
- Come on,
show her some R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

29:51.572 --> 29:52.573
Respect.

29:52.616 --> 29:55.402
- Respect is earned,
not demanded.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.779
- Hi, Chante.
- Hi.

30:24.823 --> 30:28.435
- So Chante, I brought
Dr. Bloom here with me,

30:28.478 --> 30:31.220
because I thought
you might feel more comfortable

30:31.264 --> 30:33.092
speaking with a female doctor.

30:33.135 --> 30:36.095
I also wanted to tell you that
we went around the hospital

30:36.138 --> 30:37.487
and we spoke to some lawyers
here.

30:37.531 --> 30:40.490
- And if you want to have
an abortion, then you can.

30:40.534 --> 30:42.753
- Yeah.
- But Kaye said no.

30:42.797 --> 30:46.018
- Yes, I know,
but as your guardian,

30:46.061 --> 30:48.107
she is there to support you
whenever you can't

30:48.150 --> 30:49.325
make a decision on your own.

30:49.369 --> 30:50.500
But in this case,

30:50.544 --> 30:52.241
I think it's very clear
that you can.

30:52.285 --> 30:53.547
- And as you're
only nine weeks,

30:53.590 --> 30:55.810
it is still legally
your choice to make.

30:55.854 --> 30:59.683
- I don't want Kaye mad at me.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.513
- Chante, you know,
I had to make a choice too

31:03.557 --> 31:05.776
when I was your age.

31:05.820 --> 31:10.129
Doing what was right for me,
it helped me make that choice.

31:10.172 --> 31:14.002
Didn't make it any easier,
but it did make it clearer.

31:14.046 --> 31:16.309
Do you wanna have an abortion?

31:16.352 --> 31:18.224
- Yeah.

31:18.267 --> 31:20.530
- Okay.

31:23.446 --> 31:25.274
Now, look, since you're
under guardianship,

31:25.318 --> 31:27.407
we just need to ask you
a few more questions.

31:27.450 --> 31:28.669
- More questions?

31:28.712 --> 31:29.670
- Just to make sure
that you have

31:29.713 --> 31:31.150
thought everything through.

31:31.193 --> 31:33.804
Like, after the abortion,
what's your plan?

31:33.848 --> 31:35.719
- My plan?

31:35.763 --> 31:39.332
- Your relationship with Kaye,
um...

31:39.375 --> 31:40.681
it may change.

31:48.297 --> 31:50.517
- Like, if she's mad

31:50.560 --> 31:53.128
and doesn't want me
to live with her no more?

31:53.172 --> 31:57.698
- Not living with Kaye is
a possibility.

31:57.741 --> 31:59.352
Something that you have
to think about.

31:59.395 --> 32:01.702
- And I can't lose Kaye.

32:01.745 --> 32:04.574
I can't lose Kaye.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.750
- Which is why we need a plan.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.622
- I don't need a plan.

32:08.665 --> 32:11.364
I don't need a plan.

32:11.407 --> 32:14.541
I need just Kaye.

32:22.244 --> 32:24.855
- Uh, excuse me, Detective,
where you taking her?

32:24.899 --> 32:26.901
- The precinct.
It's none of your concern.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.729
- Uh, you're taking a patient
out of my hospital.

32:28.772 --> 32:30.861
I'm very concerned.
Kaye, what did you say?

32:30.905 --> 32:32.863
- Nothing,
just that she lost her way.

32:32.907 --> 32:34.735
So now we go to the precinct.

32:41.437 --> 32:43.744
- I'm attaching the aorta.
- You have 45 seconds.

32:43.787 --> 32:45.876
- Still have to do
the pulmonary vein.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.182
Duke, I need those hands.

32:47.226 --> 32:48.531
- Target core temp
is 37 Celsius.

32:48.575 --> 32:50.229
- Sir?
- That's the pulmonary vein.

32:50.272 --> 32:52.405
Right there.
Use your 6-0 Prolene stitch.

32:52.448 --> 32:53.754
Don't back wall the vein, stat.

32:53.797 --> 32:55.234
- Give me a 6-0 Prolene
on a stick tie.

32:55.277 --> 32:57.758
- Idle breathing looks good.

32:59.194 --> 33:00.456
- She's normalizing.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.502
- You have five seconds,
but they're flicking by.

33:04.634 --> 33:06.767
- Vitals are stable.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.464
- Ah, the boot should be wider

33:08.508 --> 33:09.683
- Time.

33:09.726 --> 33:10.858
Time, Dr. Reynolds.
- I hear you.

33:10.901 --> 33:13.774
Almost there.
- Full shocks, holding.

33:13.817 --> 33:16.124
Detractor number two.
- Clamps.

33:16.995 --> 33:20.520
Duke.
- Done.

33:20.563 --> 33:22.130
- Charging.

33:22.174 --> 33:23.697
Clear.

33:30.443 --> 33:33.576
Got a heartbeat.
- I got a pulse.

33:37.493 --> 33:38.581
Dr. Reynolds.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.933
- The brainwaves aren't
picking up.

33:47.677 --> 33:49.853
Brain's warming too slowly.

33:51.420 --> 33:53.553
- Does that mean
she has brain damage?

33:53.596 --> 33:56.469
- We won't know
until she wakes up.

34:01.604 --> 34:02.823
- A little help here.

34:02.866 --> 34:03.780
- Get her to bay 24.

34:03.824 --> 34:05.260
What happened?

34:05.304 --> 34:06.609
- We were driving away
and she just started seizing.

34:06.653 --> 34:07.915
- Casey, do a finger stick.
- What's going on?

34:07.958 --> 34:09.656
- We need ten units of insulin.

34:11.310 --> 34:12.441
- Blood glucose at 550.

34:13.964 --> 34:16.402
- I need ten units of insulin,
subq.

34:23.452 --> 34:24.671
- Is she okay?

34:24.714 --> 34:26.412
- Kaye's a brittle diabetic.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.544
- Brittle?
- It's a form of diabetes.

34:28.588 --> 34:31.634
It manifests with dramatic
spiking of blood sugar levels.

34:31.678 --> 34:34.289
- Could that have caused
the accident?

34:38.902 --> 34:41.253
- Very well could have.

34:53.526 --> 34:55.484
- How are you feeling,
Miss Verdene?

34:55.528 --> 34:57.834
- Well, it ain't childbirth.

34:57.878 --> 34:59.706
How long till you know
if I'm a match?

34:59.749 --> 35:01.664
- Could be as soon as tomorrow.

35:02.970 --> 35:05.842
- You can say thank you now.

35:05.886 --> 35:07.714
- I could.

35:10.412 --> 35:12.675
Fine.

35:12.719 --> 35:14.329
Thank you.

35:14.373 --> 35:16.897
- Now, was that so hard?

35:20.814 --> 35:22.207
- Well done, Vijay.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.209
Acting out their ridiculous
feud in front of them.

35:24.252 --> 35:26.689
- Who was acting?

35:26.733 --> 35:29.039
- You weren't really upset,
were you?

35:29.083 --> 35:30.998
- Talk to my hand.

35:38.571 --> 35:40.790
- Um, hi.

35:40.834 --> 35:41.922
- Hi.

35:41.965 --> 35:44.272
- I should learn to accept
a blessing

35:44.316 --> 35:45.882
when it's offered to me, right?

35:45.926 --> 35:49.495
And to be, you know,
less of a jerk.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.414
- Well, it's about time.

36:02.551 --> 36:05.293
Oh, and some other ideas
I've been noodling:

36:05.337 --> 36:06.555
a diaper service.

36:06.599 --> 36:08.078
Or what about a CSA?

36:08.122 --> 36:09.863
Or how would you feel about
your very own car service?

36:09.906 --> 36:13.736
- It all sounds great.
Surprise me.

36:13.780 --> 36:16.652
- Okay.

36:16.696 --> 36:19.394
- Auntie Kaye!

36:19.438 --> 36:21.744
- Chante.

36:22.919 --> 36:24.617
You're about to squeeze me
in half.

36:24.660 --> 36:26.401
- I don't wanna lose you.

36:26.445 --> 36:28.490
- I'm not going anywhere.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.275
- Don't go, don't go.
- I'm right here.

36:32.799 --> 36:35.367
- The court is restoring
Chante's right

36:35.410 --> 36:36.846
to make this medical choice.

36:36.890 --> 36:41.024
And, um...she hasn't made
a decision yet,

36:41.068 --> 36:43.026
because she's a little bit
scared of how

36:43.070 --> 36:44.550
it might affect
your relationship.

36:44.593 --> 36:47.814
- Auntie Kaye,
will you still love me?

36:49.990 --> 36:52.384
- Always.

36:52.427 --> 36:53.994
But you're blocking a blessing,
Chante.

36:54.037 --> 36:56.301
- No, I'm not.
God's with me.

36:56.344 --> 36:57.606
- God is with you?

36:57.650 --> 36:59.956
- I prayed no baby.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.958
God crashed the van here.

37:02.002 --> 37:05.048
The doctor said "no baby," see?

37:07.747 --> 37:09.401
- I crashed the van.

37:10.402 --> 37:13.622
It was me.
God had nothing to do with it.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.711
- God's in you.

37:18.888 --> 37:21.978
- Is God in me?

37:22.022 --> 37:25.330
No.
No, that's not--

37:30.030 --> 37:33.120
I don't know.

37:33.163 --> 37:34.774
I don't know.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.604
I hope so.

37:38.647 --> 37:40.649
- Auntie Kaye.

37:43.086 --> 37:45.132
Auntie Kaye.

37:53.749 --> 37:55.882
- Still no change?

37:58.624 --> 37:59.842
- No.

38:01.061 --> 38:03.585
Tamala kind of reminds me
of my mom too.

38:05.587 --> 38:09.852
It's just we, uh--we haven't
talk much lately.

38:09.896 --> 38:14.379
Family stuff.

38:14.422 --> 38:19.558
- Well, if this was your mom,
what would she want right now?

38:21.734 --> 38:23.953
Couldn't hurt.

38:31.004 --> 38:35.922
