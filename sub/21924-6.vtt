AMY: Previously on "Heartland."

00:04.421 --> 00:05.338
 I thought once the
new Maggie's was open,

00:05.463 --> 00:06.923
you'd be home for good.

00:07.048 --> 00:08.800
 Georgie, you have to
understand, it's a franchise.

00:08.925 --> 00:10.844
 Yeah, it's a franchise,
so you'll open up

00:10.969 --> 00:11.845
another one and another.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.514
 I am broke.

00:14.639 --> 00:17.642
I'm having a very hard time
keeping my business afloat.

00:17.767 --> 00:19.185
 I think you could
be a really good fit

00:19.310 --> 00:21.604
for the management position.

00:21.730 --> 00:22.939
 I would love that.

00:23.064 --> 00:23.898
[laughter]

00:24.024 --> 00:25.442
 I decided not to go.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.736
I'll miss home
and everyone here.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.237
 Anyone in particular?

00:52.677 --> 00:54.596
I know your dad does a
much better job than I do,

00:54.721 --> 00:56.973
but he's busy saving
the wolves right now.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.433
He'll be back home
soon, though, OK?

[phone ringing]

01:01.895 --> 01:03.646
Hello?

01:03.772 --> 01:05.690
Hi, Lisa.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.025
Right now?

01:07.150 --> 01:08.151
No, I can't.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.945
I'm-- OK.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.530
I will meet you there.

01:12.655 --> 01:13.448
Bye.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.625
[clearing throat]

01:24.959 --> 01:27.462
 Hi, Amy, Mitch and I
were just catching up.

01:27.587 --> 01:30.423
 I can see that.

01:30.548 --> 01:31.591
 I'm going to get back at it.

01:31.716 --> 01:32.634
 OK.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.722
 There is my little baby.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.057
Hi, sweetie.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.350
Where are you guys off to?

01:40.475 --> 01:42.018
 Oh, I'm meeting
Lisa t the racetrack.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.103
Sounds like she's
having a problem

01:43.228 --> 01:44.729
with one of her racehorses.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.564
I was going to drop Lindy
off with Grandpa for a bit.

01:46.690 --> 01:47.732
 I can take her in for you.

01:47.857 --> 01:48.650
 You sure?

01:48.775 --> 01:49.567
 Yeah.

01:49.693 --> 01:54.322
And uh, listen, about Mitch.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.241
 Are you guys back on?

01:56.366 --> 01:57.701
 I don't know.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.953
We haven't really had a
chance to talk about it.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.414
 Well, yeah, probably because
of all that catching up you've

02:02.539 --> 02:03.415
had to do.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.877
 So Lou's bringing your
mom to Maggie's today.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.588
How does she feel about it?

02:10.714 --> 02:12.257
 I'm really excited
about this job, actually.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.926
 I think she'll do great.

02:15.051 --> 02:17.512
 So you glad to be sticking
around for the summer?

02:17.637 --> 02:19.055
 Yeah.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.932
I mean, I'm going to miss
Lou and Katie, of course,

02:21.057 --> 02:23.685
but I'll get to compete on
Flame and hang out with you.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.270
There's going to be
lots of fun stuff to do.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.063
There's these cool
outdoor movies,

02:27.188 --> 02:29.274
and summer fests
will be a blast.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.776
 Sounds awesome, but--

02:31.901 --> 02:32.694
 What?

02:32.819 --> 02:34.279
What's up?

02:34.404 --> 02:36.573
 I kind of flunked
my math final.

02:36.698 --> 02:37.574
 Oh.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.160
 Yes, so I have
to make that up.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.578
I can either do
a retest or I can

02:41.703 --> 02:44.289
go to Calgary for
summer school, so I'm

02:44.414 --> 02:45.790
going to do summer school.

02:45.915 --> 02:48.418
 You're not even going
to try to pass the retest?

02:48.543 --> 02:50.003
 No.

02:50.128 --> 02:53.506
I've been studying, but algebra,
you know, it's killing me.

02:53.631 --> 02:54.341
 Yeah.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.885
Word problems are the worst.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.345
 Yeah.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.847
But so we'll just
hang out when we can.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.807
[music playing]

03:07.145 --> 03:09.898
 There she is.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.150
 You're going to
have your hands full.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.569
Thank you for offering to
watch Katie and Brick, too.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.321
Jen's in a pinch for childcare.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.572
 It's no trouble.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.866
They're good company
for each other.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.701
 Katie cannot stop
talking about Brick ever

03:21.826 --> 03:22.911
since that [inaudible] clinic.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.329
[laughs]

03:24.454 --> 03:26.498
Oh, I remember when
she was this age.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.958
Now it seems like Katie's
growing up so fast.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.920
 So what's your plan
for her this summer,

03:32.045 --> 03:35.382
now that Georgie's staying put?

03:35.507 --> 03:37.258
 Katie's still coming
to New York with me.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.094
 You're going to be
awful busy, aren't you?

03:39.219 --> 03:40.637
 Don't remind me.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.263
The soft launch is
only a month away

03:42.389 --> 03:44.808
and I still have a ton
of organizing to do.

03:44.933 --> 03:48.311
 Doesn't sound like you'll
have much time for Katie.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.438
 Well, I'm hiring
a full-time nanny.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.357
 I hope you know
that Lisa and I are

03:52.482 --> 03:54.818
more than happy to pitch in.

03:54.943 --> 03:59.864
Georgie's here, and maybe you'd
consider Katie being here, too.

 Hey, there, this
is Fairfield Flier.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.543
 Wow, he's beautiful.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.128
 He is.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.214
I was all ready to sell, and
now he is just performing poorly

04:16.339 --> 04:17.464
and the sale has fallen through.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.300
 I'm sorry to hear that.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.593
So what can I do?

04:20.719 --> 04:22.095
 I just don't know
what is going on.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.431
I mean, he's just not
living up to his potential,

04:24.556 --> 04:26.141

you to please ride

04:26.266 --> 04:27.142

04:40.780 --> 04:41.448
 Come on.

04:41.573 --> 04:42.991
Hey, hey.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.034
Get up.

Come on.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.000
 I'll take it.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.419
 Thanks.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.129
 I see what you mean.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.007
I'm having a hard time getting
him to focus and respond.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.925
It's almost like he's
tired or something.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.677
Is that possible?

05:02.802 --> 05:05.305
 No, I mean, he's had the same
training regime for months.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.431
I've had two vets come out.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.641
He's got no physical issues.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.811
I need you to figure
out what the problem is.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.313
 I don't know, Lisa.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.815
I mean, I would love to help
you, but Ty being gone and--

05:15.940 --> 05:17.525
 What would it take
for you to say yes?

05:20.195 --> 05:21.696
 I would need to work
with him at Heartland,

05:21.821 --> 05:22.864
where I can be close to Lindy.

05:22.989 --> 05:23.823
 I can do that.

05:23.948 --> 05:24.991
Fine.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.409
And then you'll make
him a priority, yes?

05:26.534 --> 05:28.161
 I'll do my best,
but these things,

05:28.286 --> 05:29.204
they take as long as they take.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.622
 I understand.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.665
I have just spent so
much money on Flier,

05:32.791 --> 05:35.919
and it's having an
impact on my business.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.004
So I just need you to
get to the bottom of it

05:38.129 --> 05:39.839
as soon as possible.

05:39.964 --> 05:40.840
OK.

05:40.965 --> 05:41.800
 OK.

 See you.

06:45.321 --> 06:46.489
 See you.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.907
 What was that all about?

06:48.033 --> 06:50.118
 Oh, Wyatt failed
his math final,

06:50.243 --> 06:51.703
so I asked Adam to tutor him.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.747
Now all I have to do
is convince Wyatt.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.915
 OK, that's a terrible idea.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.250
 Why?

06:57.375 --> 06:59.961
 Well, for starters, they
have nothing in common.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.421
and you know, it
can be pretty messy

parts of your life

parts of your love life.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.806
Wyatt and I are just friends,
and so are Adam and I now.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.768
 OK, don't say I
didn't warn you.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.603
 So we just got
in a new shipment

07:16.728 --> 07:18.229
so we're pretty good
for stock right now,

07:18.355 --> 07:20.106
but the inventory is
tracked through the register

07:20.231 --> 07:22.817
so you'll know when
you need to reorder.

looking forward to diving in.

have been working here a while,

07:32.285 --> 07:35.288
so I'm really counting on your
help to get me up to speed.

 Well, I have a
lot of great ideas

 OK, great, because last year,
I pitched this open mic night.

It was awesome.
Everybody loved it.

And of course, Tim reneged on
his promise to do more of them.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.593
 You know, this is really more
of a show and tell day for Jen.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.844
Why don't we just
let her settle?

07:52.722 --> 07:54.307
 So sister location, huh?

07:54.432 --> 07:55.308

07:55.433 --> 07:56.267
Wow.

07:56.393 --> 07:57.727
 Yeah, wow.

07:57.852 --> 08:01.064
It's all feeling pretty
crazy right about now.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.190
 That's a big deal.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.109
Are you doing
anything to celebrate?

08:04.234 --> 08:05.110
 Oh, I don't know.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.569
I hadn't thought about it.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.864
It's a nice idea, but I'm
pretty swamped as it is, so.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.908
 Well, thank you for the tour.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.827
I should get going
and pick up Rick.

It was really nice of Jack
to offer to watch him.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.330
 He's happy to do it.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.749
 Katie, wow, what a lifesaver.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.793
You know, Rick took his
dad's death pretty hard,

08:21.918 --> 08:23.461
and he even stopped
speaking for a while.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.338
So it is so nice to see
him come out of his shell

08:25.463 --> 08:27.924

08:28.049 --> 08:31.386
Makes me think moving here
wasn't a bad decision.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.304
That was too much information.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.639
 Not at all.
And you know what?

08:34.764 --> 08:35.932
Katie loves Brick.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.183
She hasn't stopped
talking about him.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.684
 That's great.

08:38.809 --> 08:39.644
I'm a little worried
what's going to happen when

but this guy is beyond nervous.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.206
I'm trying to get them to
calm down a little bit.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.624
 What are you going to do?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.084
 I think I'm going to
put them in the barn

09:44.209 --> 09:45.877
with the other horses, see
if that mellows him out.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.295
Then I'm going to
call Lisa's trainer.

09:53.802 --> 09:54.594
 Hey, kiddo.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.597
 Hey, Mommy.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.141
 Do you mind if I join you?

10:00.266 --> 10:02.352
 Mm-mm.

10:02.477 --> 10:03.311
 How was your day?

10:03.436 --> 10:04.979
 Good.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.231
We helped Gigi babysit Lindy,
and tomorrow we're going

10:06.356 --> 10:07.607
to help him fix the fence.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.735
 That sounds awesome.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.154
Hey, listen, sweetheart.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.948
I was talking to Daddy.

10:15.073 --> 10:18.451
What do you think about
spending the summer here?

10:18.576 --> 10:19.744
 Like Georgie?

10:19.869 --> 10:21.830
 Yeah, exactly like Georgie.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.249
You could be with everybody
here, ride your pony,

10:24.374 --> 10:26.251
hang out with Brick
whenever you want.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.544
 Oh, thank you.

10:27.669 --> 10:28.420
Thank you.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.715
Thank you.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.718
Will you be here?

10:34.843 --> 10:37.679
 I have to go back
to New York, but I

10:37.804 --> 10:41.349
am going to come and visit you
and Georgie as much as I can,

10:41.474 --> 10:44.686
and your dad is going
to be here a lot, too.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.313
 I'm going to miss you, Mommy.

10:47.439 --> 10:48.314
 I'm going to miss you, too.

10:52.277 --> 10:53.570
 I'm going to get my
trainer to call you.

10:53.695 --> 10:54.487
- OK.
- OK.

10:54.612 --> 10:55.864
 Thanks for dinner.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.033
 You give us a shout
if you need anything.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.993
 Will do.

11:00.118 --> 11:03.163
 So I just talked to
Katie about the summer,

11:03.288 --> 11:06.041
and it turns out she would
really like to stay here, too.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.834
It was nice of you two to offer.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.044
Of course, Peter
and I, we're going

11:09.169 --> 11:10.503
to be here as much as we can.

11:10.628 --> 11:11.463
[phone ringing]

11:11.588 --> 11:12.797
Sorry, it's Nicole.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.299
I just got to take this.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.216
Nicole, hi.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.385
What's up?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.012
 I was going to tell you.

11:19.137 --> 11:22.515
 How could you not
run that by me first?

11:22.640 --> 11:24.517
 Well, I didn't think I had to.

11:24.642 --> 11:25.852
 Jack.

11:25.977 --> 11:29.272
 Lis, this is a good thing.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.901
Katie will be with family
and not with some nanny

11:33.026 --> 11:33.943
in New York City.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.780
 I know, but it's so much--

11:36.905 --> 11:37.989
yes, you're right.
Of course.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.032
I'm sorry.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.201
It's just I have
a lot on my plate.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.745
 Now, we've talked about this.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.872
What's going on?

11:45.997 --> 11:47.916
 OK.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.211
This is just between
you and me, though, OK?

11:51.336 --> 11:53.213
 All right.

11:53.338 --> 11:56.841
 I couldn't find a tenant
for my house in France.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.718
I stand to lose Fairfield.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.553
It's been with my
family forever, and I

12:00.679 --> 12:03.223
cannot be the one to lose it.

12:03.348 --> 12:06.601
I'm seeing them back in
the morning to refinance.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.854
I need money to cover costs
until everything is finalized

12:09.979 --> 12:12.816
and so I'm forced to sell Flier.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.402
I felt OK about it
because Nathan Stockwell,

12:15.527 --> 12:16.611
I like his operation.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.196
I like how he
treats his animals.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.573
But he's backed out because
of how Flier is behaving.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.200
If Amy doesn't figure
out what's wrong with him

12:22.325 --> 12:24.035
and I can't convince
him to reconsider,

12:24.160 --> 12:27.789
then I'm going to
have to auction him.

12:27.914 --> 12:31.793
 Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.045
[music playing]

12:41.261 --> 12:43.304
 Nothing else you can tell me?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.139
I appreciate it.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.098
Thanks.

12:45.223 --> 12:46.307
Bye.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.308
[sighs]

12:50.186 --> 12:51.229
 You OK?

12:51.354 --> 12:53.565
 Yeah, it was just
a really long night.

12:53.690 --> 12:54.607
 Lindy?

12:54.733 --> 12:56.276
 No, Flier.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.527
He was so restless.

12:57.652 --> 13:00.739
He just kept pacing in
his stall, calling out.

13:00.864 --> 13:01.990
 Was that Lisa's trainer?

13:02.115 --> 13:03.533
 Yeah.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.285
He said that Flier hasn't
been performing very well

13:05.410 --> 13:08.121
over the past couple of months,
but nothing in his routine

13:08.246 --> 13:09.622
has changed.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.334
He still has the same
trainers, the same workout

13:12.459 --> 13:16.546
routine, the same food,
same people around him.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.923
 It looks like he lives
a pretty pampered life.

13:19.049 --> 13:20.759
AMY: Most racehorses do.

13:20.884 --> 13:25.555
You know, they train hard, so
they need to be well-rested.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.849
If he's not settled at night,
that might be the reason

13:27.974 --> 13:30.101
why he's not performing.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.104
 Yeah, I guess I
could make sense.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.773
But here's what I don't get.

13:34.898 --> 13:38.693
It says here that he won a
bunch of races eight years ago.

13:38.818 --> 13:39.861
 Flier's a three-year-old.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.696
That can't be the same horse.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.783
GEORGIE: How can this be wrong?

13:44.908 --> 13:46.034
 I don't know.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.411
[inaudible] will find out.

13:48.536 --> 13:53.500
 Says here "a trailer carrying
goats slid into the ditch

13:53.625 --> 13:57.337
on Highway 10 and several
of the goats escaped."

13:57.462 --> 13:58.296
[laughs]

13:58.421 --> 13:59.172
 Hi.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.715
Did you talk to my trainer?

14:00.840 --> 14:04.010
 I did, and I didn't really
find out anything new.

14:04.135 --> 14:06.971
But Georgie found an
article on your website.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.223
Flier's a three-year-old.

14:08.348 --> 14:12.185
How did he win races
eight years ago?

14:12.310 --> 14:15.647
 Uh, he didn't, technically.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.816
 What do you mean?

14:17.941 --> 14:19.067
 The horse that
you're working with

14:19.192 --> 14:21.653
is not the original
Fairfield Flier.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.488
The one that won the race is.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.406
This one is a clone.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.748
 A clone?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.250
Why didn't you tell
me this before?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.168
 Maybe I anticipated
this response,

14:37.293 --> 14:39.587
but I don't really
see why it matters.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.048
 First of all, I have a lot
of concern for the health

14:42.173 --> 14:44.009
and welfare of cloned horses.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.301
 Amy, you know my
horses get the best

14:45.427 --> 14:47.053
of everything, which is
why I don't understand

14:47.178 --> 14:48.471
what's happening with Flier.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.348
He should be performing
like his genetic twin.

14:50.473 --> 14:53.309
 That doesn't guarantee that
he's going to be a winner.

14:53.435 --> 14:56.021
Lisa, who even buys
a cloned racehorse?

14:56.146 --> 14:58.231
 Lots of people do, Amy.

14:58.356 --> 14:59.941
In fact, my purchaser
was prepared

15:00.066 --> 15:01.401
to pay a premium for him.

15:01.526 --> 15:02.944
 I thought the Racing
Association didn't

15:03.069 --> 15:04.571
allow cloned horses to compete.

15:04.696 --> 15:07.824
 Clones are accepted
in polo and the Olympics

15:07.949 --> 15:11.745
and other equestrian events, and
before long, the racing world

15:11.870 --> 15:13.246
will be on board, too.

15:13.371 --> 15:15.248
What is the big deal for
you about a cloned horse?

15:15.373 --> 15:17.417
 For starters,
cloning can result

15:17.542 --> 15:19.919
in malformed organs,
respiratory issues,

15:20.045 --> 15:21.588
compromised immune systems.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.381
 OK.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.674
Amy, if you don't want to work
with the horse, that's fine.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.051
I'll find someone who does.

15:26.176 --> 15:27.302
 Yeah, well, maybe you should.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.595
 Fine.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.389
 OK, I think we could
all just take a breath.

15:31.514 --> 15:32.640
 I don't really have
time for a breath.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.309
I have a meeting in town.
Excuse me.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.355
 Did you know about this?

15:38.480 --> 15:39.314
 No.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.857
No, I didn't.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.942
She could have been a little
bit more up front about it,

15:43.068 --> 15:43.902
I guess.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.653
 Yeah, she could have.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.155
Cloning?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.115
How long has she been
doing this, anyway?

15:49.240 --> 15:51.326
What was she thinking,
that the first Flier made

15:51.451 --> 15:52.660
a whole bunch of
money, so let's just

15:52.786 --> 15:54.371
clone them and make some more?

15:54.496 --> 15:56.331
Since when has Lisa been
just about the money?

15:56.456 --> 15:58.667
 It's never been
just about the money

15:58.792 --> 16:01.795
for Lisa, that's part of what
got her into this position.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.297
 What position?

16:04.422 --> 16:07.759
 Being forced to sell a horse
she doesn't want to sell.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.469
 Hold on.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.429
If she doesn't want to sell
the horse, then why is she?

16:15.809 --> 16:17.185
 Maybe if you had
a tutor you'd have

16:17.310 --> 16:19.521
a chance at passing the retest.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.523
 Yeah, maybe.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.817
But who?

16:23.942 --> 16:25.735
 Adam.

16:25.860 --> 16:26.861
 Are you serious?
No.

16:26.986 --> 16:27.904
No way.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.489
I don't even know the guy.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.241
 He agreed to help.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.201
 You talked to him
about it already?

16:33.326 --> 16:36.496
 Actually, he'll
be here any second.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.331
 Seriously?

16:38.456 --> 16:41.126
 Come on, I'm just
trying to help you out.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.837
So will you do it, please?

16:43.962 --> 16:47.007
He can be a little hard to get
to know at first and he might

16:47.132 --> 16:48.717
seem a little bit odd, but--

16:54.180 --> 16:55.223
 We should get started.

17:02.772 --> 17:03.565
 So that went well.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.194
 I had no idea.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.323
 Amy, I don't want
you to do anything that

17:12.449 --> 17:14.409
makes you feel uncomfortable.

17:17.162 --> 17:21.415
 I don't agree
with it, Grandpa,

17:21.540 --> 17:23.752
but I will see what
I can do to help.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.339
 It'll mean a lot
to Lisa, and to me.

17:27.464 --> 17:28.381
Thank you.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.261
 What a beautiful spot.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.805
 Well, it's a mess right now.

17:35.930 --> 17:38.099
And it's normally full of
guests this time of year,

17:38.224 --> 17:39.768
but with me away
in New York, things

17:39.893 --> 17:41.603
have fallen through the cracks.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.480
 Now you got me.

17:43.605 --> 17:44.647
Don't worry, I'll
get it all cleaned up

17:44.773 --> 17:46.483
and get your bookings
back on track.

17:46.608 --> 17:49.027
 I'm so happy to hear you
say that, you have no idea.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.780
And by the way, if you have any
suggestions about this place

17:51.905 --> 17:53.490
or Maggie's, just let me know.

17:53.615 --> 17:56.409
I'm all about empowering
the people I work with.

17:56.534 --> 18:00.455
 Oh, actually then, I
do have one suggestion.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.040
 Oh, already.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.750
Fire away.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.335
 Last night I was thinking
about the launch in New York.

18:05.460 --> 18:08.588
What if we did something
at the diner to celebrate?

18:08.713 --> 18:10.840
Hold an event before
you leave, something

18:10.965 --> 18:12.384
little, maybe with music.

18:12.509 --> 18:13.677
 You know, that
open mic night Jade

18:13.802 --> 18:15.762
talked about really
wasn't as successful

18:15.887 --> 18:17.430
as she made it sound.

18:17.555 --> 18:19.808
 Maybe, but it's really about
celebrating your success.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.768
Plus, it would give me a
chance to meet my customers.

18:21.893 --> 18:23.228
 Oh, sorry.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.776
Um, OK.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.194
Sure.
- Great.

18:31.319 --> 18:32.570
Then I will head
to Maggie's now.

18:32.696 --> 18:33.279
 Great.

18:33.405 --> 18:33.780
I'll meet you there.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.164
 Oh, this is good timing.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.833
I just finished
picking up supplies.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.459
I was heading back to Heartland.

18:46.584 --> 18:49.087
 Well, good.

18:49.212 --> 18:50.672
Look at us having a coffee date.

18:56.136 --> 19:03.601
 Lou, what are we doing here?

19:03.727 --> 19:04.477
 OK.

19:04.602 --> 19:05.812
OK.

19:05.937 --> 19:08.273
I guess we have to talk
about this eventually.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.859
I know you didn't
come back here for me,

19:10.984 --> 19:15.572
but here you are, and here I am.

19:15.697 --> 19:20.452
Maybe we could just forget
about last year, start fresh.

19:20.577 --> 19:24.330
Look, things are still crazy
busy for me in New York,

19:24.456 --> 19:26.416
and they're only
going to get more

19:28.960 --> 19:31.546
Honestly, I can't wait
for it to be over.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.798
But Katie and Georgie are here.

19:33.923 --> 19:37.969
I'm going to be back
a lot more, and maybe

19:38.094 --> 19:40.388
we could just see what happens.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.226
 I don't want to
see what happens.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.230
The fact is, Lou, I--

19:52.442 --> 19:53.401
I'm in love with you.

19:56.488 --> 19:59.741
And I'm in this, if you are.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.034
 Yes.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.786
Yes, I'm in.

20:02.911 --> 20:03.745
I'm so in.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.753
 Yeah?

Hey, did you get the tickets?

20:31.898 --> 20:32.691
Awesome.

20:32.816 --> 20:33.858
OK.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.151
I can't talk.

20:35.276 --> 20:36.528
I'll call you later.

20:36.653 --> 20:39.280
Bye.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.573
Sorry, my girlfriend.

 Yeah, I'm a big fan.

 I have never met anyone
who's even heard of them.

 I mess around a little
bit on the ukulele.

 Cool.

 Hi.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.518
Look, I'm sorry.

Of course I should have
told you that he's a clone.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.648
 It's OK.

might help calm him down.

22:05.617 --> 22:07.702
 I'm surprised, after
our conversation,

22:07.827 --> 22:10.205
that you're working
on him at all.

22:10.330 --> 22:13.958
 Don't think this means that
I'm suddenly OK with cloning,

22:14.084 --> 22:16.169
because I'm not.

about your financial problems,

22:43.321 --> 22:44.698
- Outside?
- Yeah.

22:49.494 --> 22:51.371
I remember my dad grumbling
about some town bylaws.

22:51.496 --> 22:53.665
 Oh, yeah, I already cleared
it with municipal services.

22:53.790 --> 22:54.708
- You did?
- Yeah.

That's the kind of person I am.

and figure it out as I go.

23:00.088 --> 23:01.423
But I know you're
really busy, so I

23:01.548 --> 23:02.799
will take care of everything.

23:02.924 --> 23:03.550
 OK.

23:03.675 --> 23:04.592
 Oh, I've got to go.

23:04.718 --> 23:05.885
Sorry.

Hey.

23:10.015 --> 23:12.392
 Mitch, look, we found a goat.

23:12.517 --> 23:13.518
I named him Fluffy.

23:13.643 --> 23:15.186
Isn't he adorable?

23:15.311 --> 23:17.689
 I found it up there
on the north fence line.

23:17.814 --> 23:20.191
Come back here now.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.569
I'm guessing it came
from that accident.

23:22.694 --> 23:23.653
 Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.030
I heard about that.

23:25.155 --> 23:26.865
 I didn't think it
would be a good idea

23:26.990 --> 23:29.659
to leave it out there on its
own so I brought it home.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.828
 Oh, it'll probably
be an easy target.

23:31.953 --> 23:37.250
 Well, if you find a place to
put it I'll call the newspaper.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.960
 Sure.

Great.

OK, kids, let's get
this goat settled in.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.173
 OK, come on.

23:43.298 --> 23:44.132
 Come on, Floppy.

23:47.302 --> 23:48.928
 Lis, you'll never guess.

23:52.182 --> 23:53.683
What's this?

23:53.808 --> 23:56.144
 This isn't working.

23:56.269 --> 23:59.773
You clearly do not
respect the severity

23:59.898 --> 24:02.650
of my situation or my time.

24:02.776 --> 24:06.321
 I think that's
overstating things a little.

24:06.446 --> 24:07.697
 Is it?

24:07.822 --> 24:09.282
You agreed to have
Katie come and stay

24:09.407 --> 24:13.161
with us for the entire summer
without checking with me.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.246
And--

24:15.372 --> 24:16.748
 And what?

24:16.873 --> 24:18.708
 You ask me to share
things with you,

24:18.833 --> 24:20.627
and then you break
your promise by telling

24:20.752 --> 24:23.463
Amy about my personal finances.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.215
Do you realize that
if it gets out,

24:25.340 --> 24:27.092
it can jeopardize my
business dealings?

24:27.217 --> 24:30.178
 Amy is not about
to tell anyone.

24:30.303 --> 24:33.014
 You don't know that.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.891
We're clearly not on the
same page about this.

24:35.016 --> 24:37.018
I just-- I'm going
back to Fairfield.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.104
 For how long?

24:39.229 --> 24:41.064
 I don't know.

24:41.189 --> 24:43.983
This isn't working
for me right now.

24:51.950 --> 24:55.036
 There you go, Fluffy.

24:55.161 --> 24:58.415
 He's adorable.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.500
 So I hear you're sticking
around for the summer.

25:00.625 --> 25:01.918
 Yeah.

25:02.043 --> 25:03.169
I didn't want to pass
up the opportunity

25:03.294 --> 25:04.295
to compete on Flame.

25:04.421 --> 25:06.089
 Yeah, makes sense.

to be around a lot more,

25:07.841 --> 25:10.343
too, once they open
up that new location.

25:10.468 --> 25:12.053
 I doubt it.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.055
Her and Nicole are talking
about opening another one.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.473
I know she wants
to be home more,

25:15.598 --> 25:17.726
but I don't know how
realistic that is.

25:20.603 --> 25:22.063
 Huh.

[music playing]

25:36.202 --> 25:38.413

There we go.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.552
Amy's working with Lisa's horse.

25:52.677 --> 25:54.220
 Oh, my plans fell through.

25:54.346 --> 25:55.555
I can see if I can go help.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.057
 I think Amy would like that.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.020
Where is Lisa, anyway?

26:02.145 --> 26:03.897
 Oh, she's over at Fairfield.

26:04.022 --> 26:05.398
 Oh?

26:05.523 --> 26:06.816
Can I expect her for dinner?

26:06.941 --> 26:09.277
 I doubt she'll
make it tonight.

26:09.402 --> 26:10.236
 Why?

26:10.362 --> 26:11.112
Is something wrong?

26:11.237 --> 26:12.364
Were they OK?

26:12.489 --> 26:13.782
 Not exactly sure.

26:16.326 --> 26:20.163
 Look, I know that Lisa and
I don't always see eye to eye,

26:20.288 --> 26:23.124
but Amy might have accidentally
let it slip that Lisa's

26:23.249 --> 26:25.293
having money problems.

26:25.418 --> 26:26.961
 So now you know, too?

26:27.087 --> 26:30.006
See this, I shouldn't
have said anything.

26:30.131 --> 26:32.467
Lou, it's really none
of your business.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.135
 I know, it's not.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.554
But I also know how stressful
money problems can be.

26:36.680 --> 26:40.392
I mean, it's been my life
for the past year, Grandpa.

26:40.517 --> 26:42.727
It just sounds like she's
going through a lot.

26:42.852 --> 26:44.688
 She was pretty upset
when she left here.

26:44.813 --> 26:47.565
I didn't get much
chance to apologize.

26:47.691 --> 26:48.817
 What's stopping you now?

26:54.114 --> 26:55.740
 You ever worked
with a clone before?

26:55.865 --> 26:57.492
 Not that I know of.

26:57.617 --> 27:00.161
 I don't think it matters how
he made it into this world.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.706
I think he just needs to be
treated like any other horse.

27:02.831 --> 27:05.333
I get that he's supposed to
be this big shot racehorse,

27:05.458 --> 27:07.794
but maybe he doesn't want to be.

27:07.919 --> 27:09.254
He supposedly had
this great life,

27:09.379 --> 27:11.840
but it seems kind of
boring and loneluy to me.

27:16.261 --> 27:17.012
 She's right.

You too want to meet?

27:30.775 --> 27:33.236
OK, Georgie, let him go.

27:33.361 --> 27:34.612
 OK, Fluffy.

27:34.738 --> 27:35.780
 Come on, Fluffy.

27:39.117 --> 27:40.535
I've heard that
some racehorses can

27:40.660 --> 27:43.455
become really attached to
things like goats or pigs.

27:43.580 --> 27:44.706
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.082
I know it seems like
a weird pairing,

27:46.207 --> 27:48.668
but I guess sometimes
it just works.

27:48.793 --> 27:50.920
 So what do we do now?

27:51.046 --> 27:53.006
 Well, we'll let these
guys hang out, get

27:53.131 --> 27:56.092
to know each other, and
then maybe Fairfield Flier

27:56.217 --> 27:57.469
will be a little
bit more relaxed

27:57.594 --> 27:58.803
and focused on the track.

27:58.928 --> 28:00.889
 It's just like Wyatt and Adam.

28:01.014 --> 28:02.015
 What?

28:02.140 --> 28:03.016
 Wyatt's struggling
with math so I

28:03.141 --> 28:04.517
asked Adam to help tutor him.

28:04.642 --> 28:05.852
 OK.

28:05.977 --> 28:07.228
 Wyatt and I were
going to hang out,

28:07.354 --> 28:09.314
but then he decided to
tutor with Adam instead.

28:09.439 --> 28:10.982
Then we were going
to hang out tonight

28:11.107 --> 28:12.400
and he bailed on me again.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.986
He says he's studying,
but I think he just

28:15.111 --> 28:16.529
wants to hang out with Adam.

28:16.654 --> 28:17.906
We're supposed to be friends
so I don't know why he

28:18.031 --> 28:19.366
can't just be honest with me.

28:19.491 --> 28:21.785
 Are you sure that's
what's bothering you?

28:21.910 --> 28:23.578
 What do you mean?

28:23.703 --> 28:25.038
 Maybe you're
interested in Wyatt

28:25.163 --> 28:27.916
as more than just a friend.

28:34.214 --> 28:35.340
[goat bleating]

28:35.465 --> 28:37.634
 Well, I figured I'd
come see this for myself.

28:37.759 --> 28:42.263
 [chuckles] It's like he's
a totally different horse.

28:42.389 --> 28:45.475
 Well, you should know
that if he improves enough,

28:45.600 --> 28:48.269
Lisa's hoping the buyer
will take another look.

28:48.395 --> 28:49.854
 And who's the buyer?

28:49.979 --> 28:51.398
 Nathan Stockwell.

28:51.523 --> 28:52.691
 I know him.

28:52.816 --> 28:55.110
His daughter was
a client of mine.

28:55.235 --> 28:58.029
Do you think maybe it would
help if I talked to him?

28:58.154 --> 28:59.572
 Well, it couldn't hurt.

28:59.698 --> 29:01.157
But here's the thing.

29:01.282 --> 29:05.120
Lisa doesn't want word of
her situation getting out.

29:05.245 --> 29:05.954

29:09.457 --> 29:12.627
 The goat's owner
called me back.

29:12.752 --> 29:13.795
He's coming to get it.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.381
 Well, that can't happen.

29:16.506 --> 29:18.091
 Well, it's his goat.

29:18.216 --> 29:21.052
Prize goat, apparently.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.138
I don't think I've ever said
those two words together.

29:23.263 --> 29:24.681
 Grandpa, I'm not kidding.

29:24.806 --> 29:27.642
We can't separate these two.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.227
Look at them.

29:29.352 --> 29:31.688
This is the answer
to Flier's problems.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.940
You've got to figure something
out, for Flier's sake

29:34.065 --> 29:35.108
and for Lisa's.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.323
 Wow, Flier does seem calmer.

29:42.449 --> 29:43.491
 Yeah.

29:43.616 --> 29:44.784
I guess he needed
a security blanket.

29:44.909 --> 29:46.161
[laughs]

29:46.286 --> 29:47.245
 So what now?

29:47.370 --> 29:49.914
 Well, let's see if it helped.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.125
[music playing]

29:59.924 --> 30:01.009
 Lindy, see.

30:01.134 --> 30:02.010
Wave.

30:23.907 --> 30:24.991
Looking good.

30:25.116 --> 30:27.035
 Yeah, he's really
coming along.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.536
 Well, we should head out.

30:28.661 --> 30:29.954
Don't want to be late.

30:30.080 --> 30:33.583
 OK, well, Amy, you
need to get ready.

30:33.708 --> 30:34.709
I'll untie Flier.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.252
 Oh, thanks, Grandpa.

30:36.378 --> 30:37.879
 Hey, are you sure
you don't want to come?

30:38.004 --> 30:39.297
You know, Jen
hasn't had much time

30:39.422 --> 30:40.674
to put this together
so there probably

30:40.799 --> 30:42.050
won't be many people there.

30:42.175 --> 30:44.594
 Then one less body
won't make a difference.

30:44.719 --> 30:47.889
Plus I've got a few things
that I need to take care.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.058
[country music playing]

30:53.269 --> 30:54.854
 Wow, this looks amazing.

30:54.979 --> 30:57.482
 Yeah.

30:57.607 --> 30:59.150
Hey, Jade.

30:59.275 --> 31:01.277
 Maggie's resident
mixologist at your service.

31:01.403 --> 31:03.571
 Wow, Maggie's
has a mixologist.

31:03.697 --> 31:04.781
 What are these?

31:04.906 --> 31:06.074
 Mojitos.

31:06.199 --> 31:07.742
 Mm, they're
actually pretty good.

31:07.867 --> 31:09.536
 Mm, yeah.

31:09.661 --> 31:11.162
 And if you guys like these,
you should try the real ones.

31:11.287 --> 31:12.580
[chuckles]

31:12.706 --> 31:13.581
 Hey.

31:13.707 --> 31:14.749
 Hey.

31:14.874 --> 31:17.627
 I didn't know you were coming.

31:17.752 --> 31:20.922
 To congratulate the
woman of the hour.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.216
 Hey, I'll catch up
with you guys in a bit.

31:23.341 --> 31:24.384
There's someone I need to meet.

31:24.509 --> 31:25.427
 OK.

31:28.304 --> 31:30.098
 Lou, guest of honor.

31:30.223 --> 31:33.101
 Oh my gosh, this is amazing.

31:33.226 --> 31:34.728
Honestly, I didn't
think you could pull

31:34.853 --> 31:36.896
it off on such short notice.

31:37.022 --> 31:39.607
 Neither did I. [laughs]

31:39.733 --> 31:40.567
 Oh, I'm sorry.

31:40.692 --> 31:42.152
This is Jen.

31:42.277 --> 31:44.362
 Oh, yeah, you're the
new manager around here.

31:44.487 --> 31:45.613
 And [inaudible].

31:45.739 --> 31:47.615
And this is Mitch, my--

31:47.741 --> 31:51.202
 I work at Heartland
with Jen and Jack.

31:51.327 --> 31:53.413
 So nice to finally meet you.

31:53.538 --> 31:55.373
OK, well, I'm going to get
back to it, meet my customers.

31:55.498 --> 31:56.416
Have fun.

31:56.541 --> 31:57.917
 OK.

31:58.043 --> 32:00.628
Listen, this time
around, I really

32:00.754 --> 32:04.424
think that we should be upfront
with people about our status.

32:07.093 --> 32:10.138
 Yeah, about that.

32:10.263 --> 32:12.557
 What?

32:12.682 --> 32:14.893
 You know, this isn't
really the time or place.

32:15.018 --> 32:16.561
 That doesn't sound good.

32:16.686 --> 32:17.645
Now you have to tell me.

32:21.107 --> 32:24.986
 I'm really happy for you, for
all your success with New York.

32:25.111 --> 32:29.449
I mean, you deserve it.

32:29.574 --> 32:30.992
 But?

32:31.117 --> 32:34.704
 But this is only the beginning
of your American expansion.

32:34.829 --> 32:37.791
You guys are planning on opening
up other locations, right?

32:37.916 --> 32:40.460
 Yeah, we have discussed it.

32:40.585 --> 32:42.629
Why?

32:42.754 --> 32:48.593
 Listen, having you back
in my life has been amazing.

32:51.179 --> 32:53.556
And I got caught up.

32:53.682 --> 32:56.976
I did, but I have to
be realistic here.

32:57.102 --> 32:59.104
 Where is this coming from?

32:59.229 --> 33:01.189
Mitch, you said--

33:01.314 --> 33:02.315
 I know.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.609
I know what I said,
and I meant it.

33:04.734 --> 33:05.485
I do, every word.

33:05.610 --> 33:07.696
 So then what is the problem?

33:07.821 --> 33:09.781
 I can't do this, Lou.

33:09.906 --> 33:12.867
I-- I thought I could, but I--

33:12.992 --> 33:13.910
 Mitch.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.286
 I can't.

33:15.412 --> 33:18.498
No misread signs, no
misunderstandings,

33:18.623 --> 33:19.708
although that has
been our go-to.

33:23.920 --> 33:27.966
Bottom line is that you're
not going to be around here,

33:28.091 --> 33:29.300
and I'd never be happy there.

33:32.095 --> 33:33.054
So the ball's in your court.

33:35.557 --> 33:37.392
You have to decide
what's important to you.

33:51.531 --> 33:52.907
 Thank you for meeting with me.

33:53.033 --> 33:54.451
 The least I could do.

33:54.576 --> 33:55.994
Emma still talks about
how you helped her out.

33:56.119 --> 33:56.870
 How is she doing?

33:56.995 --> 33:58.121
How's Thunder doing?

33:58.246 --> 33:59.372
 They're both
doing really well.

33:59.497 --> 34:00.540
Emma's getting
married this fall.

34:00.665 --> 34:01.875
 Tell her
congratulations from me.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.335
 I will.

34:03.460 --> 34:05.462
Yeah, it's pretty crazy
how the time flies.

34:05.587 --> 34:09.591
If you don't know that
already, you're about to learn.

34:09.716 --> 34:13.053
So Lisa tells me you're
working with Flier.

34:13.178 --> 34:15.764
 I am, and I think
he's worth another look.

34:15.889 --> 34:18.558
 Well, I have to admit,
I did have high hopes,

34:18.683 --> 34:21.811
but I wasn't all that
impressed with his performance.

34:21.936 --> 34:25.565
 Well, we've found some issues
with his training routine,

34:25.690 --> 34:28.443
so we've changed them and
it's made a huge impact.

34:28.568 --> 34:30.152
I really think it's
worth your time.

34:30.277 --> 34:35.074
 I'll tell you what, I've got
a young racehorse in my stable.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.159
He's been on a winning streak.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.871
What do you say we put them
head to head on the track,

34:39.996 --> 34:40.996
see what happens?

34:41.121 --> 34:42.206
 Sounds like a plan.

34:45.085 --> 34:46.293
[music playing]

34:49.922 --> 34:50.799
[laughs]

34:52.509 --> 34:54.636
 I just took his crazy
tough practice test today.

34:54.761 --> 34:55.553
 Oh, yeah?

34:55.679 --> 34:57.180
 Yeah.

34:57.305 --> 35:01.893
 The good news is I passed, so
I'm going to take the retest.

35:02.018 --> 35:04.104
 He's totally ready.

35:04.229 --> 35:05.438
 That's cool.

35:05.563 --> 35:06.564
It's great.

35:06.690 --> 35:09.150
I need to get back
to the kitchen, so.

35:09.275 --> 35:15.240
 Hey, Georgie, you OK?

35:15.365 --> 35:17.033
 Yeah, of course.

35:17.158 --> 35:19.327
 Yeah, because I don't know.

35:19.452 --> 35:22.163
You seem kind of off.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.873
What's wrong?

35:23.998 --> 35:25.625
 It's you and Adam.

35:25.750 --> 35:28.753
Just didn't expect you guys
to become such great friends

35:28.878 --> 35:29.671
all of the sudden.

35:29.796 --> 35:31.381
 Look, he's a great guy.

35:31.506 --> 35:34.509
And I might actually have
an outside shot of passing

35:34.634 --> 35:37.262
this retest now,
and that wasn't even

35:37.387 --> 35:41.057
remotely a possibility last
week, and that's thanks to you.

35:41.182 --> 35:43.435
And if I do pass
the retest, then

35:43.560 --> 35:45.854
me and you can hang out more.

35:48.773 --> 35:52.152
 So you'd like that?

35:52.277 --> 35:53.611
 Duh.

35:53.737 --> 35:55.363
That's why I've been
studying so hard.

35:58.575 --> 36:00.618
OK, I'll prove it to you.

36:00.744 --> 36:02.370
Stay here, OK?

36:02.495 --> 36:03.288
Just don't leave.

36:03.413 --> 36:04.330
 What are you doing here?

36:04.456 --> 36:05.498
EMPLOYEE: Thank you.

36:05.623 --> 36:06.791
 Hi, can I just
quickly use this?

36:06.916 --> 36:07.667
 Oh, sure.

36:07.792 --> 36:08.710
 OK, thanks.

36:16.676 --> 36:17.719
Testing.

36:17.844 --> 36:20.764
Hi, I'm Wyatt.

36:20.889 --> 36:25.643
And I've never done this before,
but this is for someone special

36:25.769 --> 36:28.563
out there.

36:28.688 --> 36:30.648
[guitar playing]

36:34.611 --> 36:38.281
(SINGING) There's no
need to complicate it,

36:38.406 --> 36:40.909
dress it up or overstate it.

36:41.034 --> 36:46.831
Without too much hesitation,
here's the way I feel.

36:46.956 --> 36:48.249
I like you.

36:48.375 --> 36:52.754
I like you, even
when I don't try to.

36:52.879 --> 36:54.172
Yes, I do.

36:54.297 --> 36:55.840
That's the truth.

36:55.965 --> 36:56.758
I like you.

37:00.261 --> 37:02.097
 Holy moly.

37:02.222 --> 37:05.934
 It's good to see you.

37:06.059 --> 37:09.688
 What is going on here?

37:09.813 --> 37:13.441
 Lis, I'm sorry.

37:13.566 --> 37:15.694
I know you're under
a lot of stress

37:15.819 --> 37:19.280
and I should never
have added to that.

37:19.406 --> 37:22.409
I know I said too
much to Amy, but I'm

37:22.534 --> 37:25.245
hoping you'll understand
I was only trying to help.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.372
If I could do more,
I would, but you

37:27.497 --> 37:29.916
got to know I'm in your corner.

37:30.041 --> 37:32.127
 I know.

37:32.252 --> 37:33.378
And I'm sorry.

37:33.503 --> 37:36.089
I overreacted.

37:36.214 --> 37:37.215
You know it's so not like me.

37:37.340 --> 37:38.800
[laughter]

37:41.302 --> 37:43.888
I'm wondering if
I can come home.

37:44.014 --> 37:45.640
 You are.

37:45.765 --> 37:47.642
[guitar playing]

37:55.942 --> 38:00.572
[inaudible] I bought
you something.

38:00.697 --> 38:01.990
 You bought me something.

38:02.115 --> 38:03.658
 (SINGING) I like you.

38:03.783 --> 38:08.246
I like you, even
when I don't try to.

38:08.371 --> 38:09.748
Yes, I do.

38:09.873 --> 38:11.291
That's the truth.

38:11.416 --> 38:12.500
I like you.

[applause]

38:24.304 --> 38:26.765
 Wow, that was adorable.

38:26.890 --> 38:28.808
 So cute.

38:28.933 --> 38:30.185
 Where's Mitch?

38:30.310 --> 38:31.436
 [sigh]

38:32.812 --> 38:34.230
[laughs]

38:34.356 --> 38:36.983
 Thank you all so much for
coming out to this event.

38:37.108 --> 38:40.195
I'm Jen, Maggie's new
manager, and I'm so

38:40.320 --> 38:42.781
thrilled to be working here
and to meet each and every one

38:42.906 --> 38:44.157
of you personally.

38:44.282 --> 38:47.327
We are all here because of
one very special person,

38:47.452 --> 38:49.037
so give it up for Lou Fleming.

38:49.162 --> 38:50.497
[applause]

38:51.331 --> 38:52.707
[baby crying]

38:53.792 --> 38:55.210
 I should probably
get her home.

38:55.335 --> 38:56.252
 OK, I'll come with you.

38:56.378 --> 38:59.297
 No, Lou, this is your day.

38:59.422 --> 39:00.674
Stay and enjoy it.

39:00.799 --> 39:01.716
 OK.

39:10.308 --> 39:13.186
 Huh, a goat.

39:13.311 --> 39:15.855
 Sure seems to
settle Flier down.

39:15.980 --> 39:18.733
 Well, you sure know
how to sweep a girl

39:18.858 --> 39:20.568
right off her feet, don't you?

39:20.694 --> 39:21.528
[laughs]

39:21.653 --> 39:22.737
 What do you think?

39:22.862 --> 39:23.863
 Uh, I--

39:23.988 --> 39:26.908
I cannot believe
how relaxed he is.

39:27.033 --> 39:28.868
 He's going to take on a
young racehorse at the track

39:28.993 --> 39:29.911
tomorrow.
- He is?

39:30.036 --> 39:30.870
Really?

39:30.995 --> 39:32.122
Is he ready?

39:32.247 --> 39:33.832
 I'm counting on it.

39:33.957 --> 39:36.918
I convinced Nathan Stockwell
to give him another chance.

39:37.043 --> 39:37.836
 You did?

39:37.961 --> 39:39.129
Oh my.

39:39.254 --> 39:40.088
Thank you so much.

39:40.213 --> 39:41.089
Thank you both.

39:41.214 --> 39:42.674
[goat bleating]

39:50.140 --> 39:51.891
 Oh, you look tired.

39:52.017 --> 39:53.018
How are you?

39:53.143 --> 39:54.477
 I'm all right.

39:54.602 --> 39:56.062
How's my little girl doing?

39:56.187 --> 39:57.564
 She's doing great.

39:57.689 --> 39:59.274
I think she misses her
daddy, though, don't you?

39:59.399 --> 40:00.275
Can you wave to daddy?

40:00.400 --> 40:02.235
Say hi.

40:02.360 --> 40:04.362
 Daddy misses you, too, baby.

40:04.487 --> 40:05.613
And my other girl.

40:05.739 --> 40:07.032
That race is today, right?

40:07.157 --> 40:08.408
 Yeah.

40:08.533 --> 40:10.493
I'm a little bit
nervous about it.

40:10.618 --> 40:11.536
 Don't be.

40:11.661 --> 40:13.913
You're going to do great.

40:14.039 --> 40:15.707
 Thanks.

40:15.832 --> 40:17.125
Love you.

40:17.250 --> 40:19.919
 I love you, too, both of you.

40:20.045 --> 40:21.087
 Bye, Daddy.

 Hey, you made it.

40:29.804 --> 40:31.348
 Yeah, of course.

40:31.473 --> 40:32.974
It's not every day you get
to see a private horse race.

40:35.810 --> 40:37.937
Notice anything different?

40:38.063 --> 40:39.105
 No, should I?

40:39.230 --> 40:40.231
 Maybe.

40:40.357 --> 40:41.816
You're talking to a free man.

40:44.444 --> 40:45.320
 I don't get it.

40:45.445 --> 40:47.447
 Yeah.

40:47.572 --> 40:50.283
I took the retest and I passed.

40:50.408 --> 40:51.201
 No way.

40:51.326 --> 40:52.118
Congrats.

40:52.243 --> 40:53.495
 Thank you.

40:53.620 --> 40:55.080
So I guess you'll be
seeing a lot of me

40:55.205 --> 40:56.915
this summer, if you want.

41:11.388 --> 41:13.515
[music playing]

41:19.729 --> 41:21.815
 You can do this.

41:21.940 --> 41:22.816
Come on.

41:22.941 --> 41:23.858
Come on.

41:30.949 --> 41:31.866
Come on.

Yes, come on.

41:47.298 --> 41:48.174
Come on.

41:48.299 --> 41:49.217

 Oh, oh.

42:13.950 --> 42:14.909
 Come on.

42:19.330 --> 42:20.123
 Yes.

42:20.248 --> 42:21.583
[cheering]

42:23.877 --> 42:25.211
 Yes.

42:25.337 --> 42:26.921
[music playing]

42:27.047 --> 42:30.592
(SINGING) You get to dreaming
underneath a thousand stars.

42:30.717 --> 42:31.843
 That was incredible.

42:31.968 --> 42:33.011
 Yeah, that was awesome.

42:33.136 --> 42:34.262
 She did it.

42:34.387 --> 42:36.556
[laughs] You two were
terrific out there.

42:36.681 --> 42:39.351
 Nice job, baby.

42:39.476 --> 42:41.353
 It was all down to this guy.

42:41.478 --> 42:42.437
You're amazing.

42:42.562 --> 42:43.730
 Yeah, that was really great.

42:43.855 --> 42:46.608
 Well, Lisa, I can
admit when I'm wrong.

42:46.733 --> 42:47.776
He clocked a fast time.

42:47.901 --> 42:49.235
You got yourself a deal.

42:49.361 --> 42:52.781
 Well, Nathan, it's
actually a package deal now.

42:52.906 --> 42:53.740
 What does that mean?

42:53.865 --> 42:55.533
 The goat goes, too.

42:55.658 --> 42:56.659
I made a promise.

42:56.785 --> 42:58.328
It's all or nothing.

42:58.453 --> 43:00.330
 The goat helps him focus.

43:00.455 --> 43:01.289
 The goat?

43:04.417 --> 43:05.543
You're serious about this?

43:05.669 --> 43:06.628
 Well, you saw it
with your own eyes.

43:06.753 --> 43:08.129
I mean, you want
a winner or not?

43:12.842 --> 43:14.469
 Who can argue with that?

43:14.594 --> 43:15.929
Deal.

43:16.054 --> 43:16.805
 Thank you.

43:16.930 --> 43:17.806
[laughs]

43:19.516 --> 43:20.975
 Hey Chuck, I bought a goat.

43:21.101 --> 43:22.227
[laughs]

43:25.063 --> 43:27.399
 That's the best
present you ever gave me.

43:27.524 --> 43:28.983
[laughter]

43:35.365 --> 43:36.700
[music playing]

43:36.825 --> 43:38.785
(SINGING) There must be
something in the air.

43:43.164 --> 43:45.250
There must be
something in the air.

43:50.130 --> 43:53.091
There must be
something in the air.

43:56.344 --> 44:01.016
There must be
something in the air.
