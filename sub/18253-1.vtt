27:39.491 --> 27:42.595
Yes, my husband had
an affair with her.

27:44.872 --> 27:48.317
And she left your husband's
employment in June of 2001?

27:49.751 --> 27:52.400
I told him to let her go.

27:52.796 --> 27:53.897
Ah.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.867
And as far as you know, that was
the end of the relationship?

27:58.468 --> 28:00.991
Yes, as far as I know.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.932
Your husband's phone
records indicate they were

28:04.933 --> 28:07.707
in regular contact
beyond that date.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.477
Is that all?

28:33.795 --> 28:36.865
Sure. That's it for now. Thank you.

28:45.098 --> 28:49.624
My children don't know about this.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell them.

28:50.312 --> 28:52.210
I understand.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.586
ARNOLD: Ham or tuna?

29:41.321 --> 29:42.968
Ham.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.224
We'll split it.

30:01.758 --> 30:03.531
Thank you.

30:07.723 --> 30:11.726
You know, Arnold, I think
you may have the wrong man.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.436
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:13.437 --> 30:16.461
You want my neighbor,
Mr. Shipley. He's loaded.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.508
You think I made a mistake?

30:19.401 --> 30:21.902
Happens all the time.
Perfectly intelligent people,

30:21.903 --> 30:24.989
pick up a wrong bag
at the airport...

30:24.990 --> 30:26.657
I know all about you.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.978
"The man Hertz and
Avis are afraid of."

30:30.579 --> 30:31.680
Oh.

30:31.997 --> 30:34.248
- I see...
- You grew up in Altoona.

30:34.249 --> 30:35.833
You married your high
school sweetheart.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.357
You won a scholarship
to Penn State.

30:39.546 --> 30:42.923
You had a good job, but you quit
to start a car-rental business.

30:42.924 --> 30:46.619
Didn't make sense at the time,
but you made it work.

30:47.179 --> 30:52.160
In those days the greatest challenge
was keeping your marriage together.

30:53.435 --> 30:56.562
- They wrote that. I didn't.
- You like to watch the Pirates.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.065
You have a house on
a lake in the woods.

30:59.066 --> 31:03.527
A boat in which you like to float on
summer afternoons to clear your mind.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.696
And two children,
a son and daughter,

31:05.697 --> 31:08.220
all grown up now.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.510
That about sums it up.

31:11.453 --> 31:15.649
So when did you lose your job?

31:17.709 --> 31:20.107
I guess it's obvious, huh?

31:20.712 --> 31:22.380
Eight years ago, November.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.298
And what did you do?

31:24.299 --> 31:27.343
I was a manager of sorts.

31:27.344 --> 31:32.723
And you thought if you were hardworking
and loyal you'd be safe, right?

31:32.724 --> 31:36.795
I worked there 17 years.
Out of their hands, they said.

31:36.937 --> 31:39.647
- Well, it probably was.
- That's what they said.

31:39.648 --> 31:42.233
Changing economy.
Gotta keep things profitable.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.735
- I've heard it all.
- Nothing personal.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.363
- Yeah, right.
- It's a terrible thing.

31:47.364 --> 31:48.781
A lot of good people
lost their jobs.

31:48.782 --> 31:53.262
I'd say 30 percent of our work force
at one point was from Hadley.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.436
You could have come work for us.

32:04.548 --> 32:07.242
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
condescend me, Wayne.

32:08.510 --> 32:11.864
I know how the world works.
That's why I'm out here with you.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.578
So, what does your wife
think about this plan?

32:18.979 --> 32:21.958
- My wife?
- Yeah. Those are her cigarettes.

32:24.526 --> 32:26.378
You can keep things from your wife.

32:27.362 --> 32:30.364
- I don't know.
- What?

32:30.365 --> 32:32.342
You've never deceived your wife?

32:33.201 --> 32:37.226
Well, there are levels of deception,
Arnold. I mean, this is a whopper.

32:37.622 --> 32:38.723
Oh.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.844
Well, how about you?

32:51.845 --> 32:54.013
- Me?
- You know everything about me.

32:54.014 --> 32:55.957
Tell me about yourself.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.168
All right. Um...

33:03.982 --> 33:06.734
I have a wife and two daughters.

33:06.735 --> 33:11.572
One of my daughters supposedly lives
with us. She's got some boyfriend.

33:11.573 --> 33:16.410
I think he's a mute. Can't tell
you the last time I saw her.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.829
My wife

33:18.830 --> 33:22.500
is trying to kill herself
with cigarettes.

33:22.501 --> 33:26.545
We live with her father.
He sleeps in the den.

33:26.546 --> 33:29.798
He has his own TV,
but he's hard of hearing,

33:29.799 --> 33:32.426
and he doesn't like to wear
his hearing aids at night

33:32.427 --> 33:35.804
so he lies in bed and plays it so loud,
we can hear it in our room.

33:35.805 --> 33:39.830
Sometimes he leaves it on all night.
But what can I say? It's his house.

33:43.480 --> 33:46.709
I don't say anything
much at all, Wayne.

33:47.817 --> 33:50.819
It's a household of...

33:50.820 --> 33:52.888
...disappointed people.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.717
But...

33:56.368 --> 33:59.221
We have our health,
and we have each other, so...

34:00.288 --> 34:01.413
Ah.

34:01.414 --> 34:03.687
Everybody suffers,
isn't that right?

34:05.252 --> 34:07.480
Yeah, everybody suffers.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.568
Did you always have that moustache?

34:18.306 --> 34:20.329
So long as I could grow one.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.926
<i>WAYNE (ON TAPE): This is Wayne.</i>

34:30.235 --> 34:33.429
<i>Eileen, I'm fine.</i>

34:47.252 --> 34:51.505
Our profilers believe the letters are
probably being written by one person.

34:51.505 --> 34:55.156
Male, some college education,
white, over 30.

34:55.467 --> 34:57.469
But we do believe we're
dealing with a group.

34:57.470 --> 35:01.416
To keep a hostage for a prolonged
period requires multiple participants.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.685
Why haven't they
asked for anything?

35:04.686 --> 35:06.880
They're showing you
who's in control.

35:07.731 --> 35:09.879
I'd like to suggest a
different approach.

35:10.191 --> 35:13.360
They haven't acknowledged our
request to communicate by phone,

35:13.361 --> 35:15.529
so we should place a personal ad

35:15.530 --> 35:18.365
confirming you received
the recording,

35:18.366 --> 35:21.140
but we also claim you
got a ransom demand.

35:21.411 --> 35:24.515
You're willing to pay. You just
want to pay the right people.

35:25.081 --> 35:28.208
If they think you'll give
their money to someone else,

35:28.209 --> 35:30.357
they usually call within 24 hours.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.077
Okay, so we're agreed.
We do what Fuller says.

35:44.726 --> 35:47.811
Well, I'm not gonna make
this decision alone.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.540
You're not alone, sweetheart.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.845
Where are you going?

36:04.371 --> 36:06.439
I'm going to get
something for Oscar.

36:06.623 --> 36:07.895
You're going shopping?

36:09.751 --> 36:13.651
It's his first birthday.
It's important we celebrate it.

36:15.548 --> 36:17.241
Are you coming?

36:20.845 --> 36:26.558
<i>ALL: (SINGING)
Happy birthday dear Oscar</i>

36:26.559 --> 36:31.881
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

36:40.448 --> 36:43.158
- Is he asleep?
- Finally.

36:43.159 --> 36:45.369
He woke up the minute
I put him down.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.768
Wayne will be sorry
to have missed it.

36:47.789 --> 36:50.062
Yeah, he loves birthdays.

36:53.002 --> 36:57.256
You know, Lane, for my first birthday
after Wayne and I were married,

36:57.257 --> 37:01.218
he wanted to surprise me, so we
drove to a hotel in the mountains.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.888
We could not afford it,
but he insisted, as usual.

37:04.889 --> 37:07.307
Anyway, when we got there,
they'd never heard of us.

37:07.308 --> 37:10.958
I don't know, he messed up the
reservations or something.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.855
Anyway, he was devastated,

37:12.856 --> 37:16.442
so he pleaded and then he
tried to sound important.

37:16.443 --> 37:18.671
- But they took no pity on us.
- Poor Dad.

37:19.112 --> 37:23.157
We finished up at an all-night diner,
because there were no hotel rooms.

37:23.158 --> 37:25.868
But he made them put candles
on everything we ate.

37:25.869 --> 37:29.348
In the rice pudding,
in the hamburgers...

37:30.331 --> 37:34.732
And they all sang "Happy
Birthday." it was great.

37:37.672 --> 37:41.633
I remember once he convinced me
it was a special birthday treat

37:41.634 --> 37:44.052
to go to work with him
and help clean cars.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.746
I fell for that too.

37:46.723 --> 37:48.791
You loved it. Both of you.

37:49.851 --> 37:53.626
He really made you feel like you
were the center of the world.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.754
I hope Oscar gets to feel that.

38:00.195 --> 38:01.797
He will.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.733
- Hold it.
- (PANTING)

38:15.919 --> 38:18.045
This is where we meet the others?

38:18.046 --> 38:19.880
- No.
- What then?

38:19.881 --> 38:21.824
Just a break.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.736
You can sit over there.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.998
May I see the pictures of my wife?

38:38.691 --> 38:40.168
What for?

38:40.693 --> 38:42.841
May I see them?

39:10.265 --> 39:12.663
She'd hate the idea
of being watched.

39:14.143 --> 39:17.998
She's self-conscious. Even with me.

39:26.823 --> 39:28.891
She's beautiful.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.795
You know what I think?

39:41.796 --> 39:43.398
What?

39:44.048 --> 39:46.776
I don't think there's
anybody watching my wife.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.404
And do you know what that means?

39:50.221 --> 39:51.538
No.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.209
It means I'm gonna have
to give you the slip.

39:56.477 --> 39:59.813
You wouldn't want to do that.
You'd get me into a world of trouble.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.815
- I'd be sorry about that.
- Anyway,

40:01.816 --> 40:03.942
your wife'll pay and
then you can go home.

40:03.943 --> 40:05.819
If she wants you back.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.696
Have you done anything terrible?

40:07.697 --> 40:09.845
I've never pointed a gun at anyone.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.933
Does your wife know about
the company you keep?

40:16.831 --> 40:18.524
That woman?

40:19.584 --> 40:21.982
I told you I know all about you.

40:22.712 --> 40:25.547
I followed you there once.
I sat outside.

40:25.548 --> 40:28.527
- You followed me?
- They asked me to.

40:29.510 --> 40:33.615
I'd say that's a whopper, Wayne.
Isn't that a whopper?

40:38.353 --> 40:41.521
- We should get going.
- This is a beautiful spot, Arnold.

40:41.522 --> 40:42.999
You picked a great day for it.

40:43.524 --> 40:46.443
I didn't pick it. Let's go, Wayne.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.888
I love my wife, Arnold.

40:49.489 --> 40:52.157
We have two beautiful kids.

40:52.158 --> 40:54.534
And I'm just getting to know them.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.808
For most of their lives
I've been working.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.665
I missed a lot.

40:59.666 --> 41:02.459
I'm not suggesting you
didn't love them.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.937
Come on. Let's go.

41:06.255 --> 41:08.153
No.

41:09.050 --> 41:11.301
- Come on.
- No, this'll do just fine.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.095
- Tell me where we're going.
- Let's go.

41:13.096 --> 41:15.055
Look at yourself.

41:15.056 --> 41:17.432
You've lost your job,
you put people in trunks...

41:17.433 --> 41:19.226
- Get up.
- What if everybody did that?

41:19.227 --> 41:20.829
You goddamn lunatic.

41:24.232 --> 41:26.676
How many times have you
fired that gun, Arnold?

41:41.582 --> 41:44.918
There's a hunting
cabin near the top.

41:44.919 --> 41:47.113
I'm gonna drop you off,
then I go. That's it.

41:47.797 --> 41:50.025
There's some guys waiting for you.

41:50.091 --> 41:54.116
I work for them. They're okay.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.430
<i>MAN (ON TV): I wish I'd paid better
attention, you know,</i>

41:56.431 --> 41:58.765
<i>but I was mowing the lawn.</i>

41:58.766 --> 42:01.810
<i>All I remember is,
he wasn't a gardener.</i>

42:01.811 --> 42:07.589
<i>He was white, middle-aged, I guess.
He was wearing a suit, I think.</i>

42:07.942 --> 42:11.653
<i>And he was standing at the side of
the car, talking to Mr. Hayes.</i>

42:11.654 --> 42:16.616
A driver from one of the local bus routes
remembers a man of similar description.

42:16.617 --> 42:21.393
We've come up with a composite sketch
based on those descriptions. Here you go.

42:28.087 --> 42:29.188
(BABY CRYING)

42:30.590 --> 42:33.569
Does that resemble
anyone you might know?

42:34.761 --> 42:37.535
Yeah, it resembles a million
people I might know.

42:37.972 --> 42:40.291
What about the personal ad?

42:40.308 --> 42:41.725
There's still no response.

42:41.726 --> 42:46.063
As they have so far refused
to make phone contact,

42:46.064 --> 42:49.691
I'd like to demand an assurance
of Mr. Hayes' safety.

42:49.692 --> 42:52.736
I think this organization
would expect such a demand.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.863
Wait a minute. Mr. Fuller,

42:54.864 --> 42:58.992
at your suggestion we threatened to
give their money to someone else.

42:58.993 --> 43:03.038
Since then, they haven't contacted us.
They've made no demand.

43:03.039 --> 43:05.665
We're further from resolving this
than we were to begin with.

43:05.666 --> 43:08.794
What difference does it
make who was on the bus?

43:08.795 --> 43:13.742
I think you don't have the faintest
fucking idea who those people are!

43:20.098 --> 43:25.420
So, what would you
consider an assurance?

43:26.270 --> 43:28.418
A phone conversation.

43:29.190 --> 43:31.608
If they won't confirm
your husband's safety,

43:31.609 --> 43:33.962
we should consider the
negotiation over.

43:40.034 --> 43:41.135
Come here.

43:42.453 --> 43:45.978
Mrs. Hayes, if they can
make you desperate,

43:46.499 --> 43:49.728
they know you'll give
them anything they want.

44:22.994 --> 44:25.517
I want to apologize for my son.

44:27.373 --> 44:29.942
FULLER: Well, that's not necessary.

44:31.961 --> 44:34.129
- Please, sit down.
- You know, it's strange.

44:34.130 --> 44:37.799
You've never met my husband,
but you know all about him.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.926
Yeah, I'm used to it.

44:39.927 --> 44:43.076
You'd like him.
He inspires confidence.

44:43.848 --> 44:45.871
It's his great talent.

44:47.185 --> 44:50.255
A man like that needs
to be appreciated.

44:51.105 --> 44:55.317
It gets worse as they get older.
They feel themselves being forgotten.

44:55.318 --> 44:57.027
You don't have to
explain anything...

44:57.028 --> 44:59.927
I'm trying to explain
my husband, Mr. Fuller.

45:05.036 --> 45:07.889
Did you tell my son
about that woman?

45:08.956 --> 45:10.874
I asked him to look over
some phone records.

45:10.875 --> 45:13.627
- I don't know...
- You said you wouldn't.

45:13.628 --> 45:17.403
- I said that I understood.
- What if I looked into your marriage?

45:18.716 --> 45:21.160
It wouldn't look very
good at the moment.

45:45.159 --> 45:47.261
What are you doing?

45:47.828 --> 45:51.478
I was thinking about Dad.

45:53.834 --> 45:56.608
I'm afraid I'm never
gonna see him again.

45:59.215 --> 46:02.114
What would you say
to him if you could?

46:03.094 --> 46:04.912
That I love him.

46:07.223 --> 46:09.683
You know,

46:09.684 --> 46:13.270
when I told him that I
was pregnant with you

46:13.271 --> 46:17.467
that's the only time
I've ever seen him cry.

46:20.861 --> 46:22.713
He knows you love him.

46:38.254 --> 46:43.049
These guys waiting for us,
have I done something to them?

46:43.050 --> 46:44.384
No.

46:44.385 --> 46:47.095
And you. You seem to
know a lot about me.

46:47.096 --> 46:49.306
Have I done something to you?

46:49.307 --> 46:51.660
No, you haven't done
anything to me.

46:52.893 --> 46:55.103
You're good with names.

46:55.104 --> 46:57.439
You're famous for it, you know?

46:57.440 --> 47:03.111
I read somebody can meet you once
and you see them again 10 years later,

47:03.112 --> 47:07.574
and you greet them as if you
saw them every day of your life.

47:07.575 --> 47:12.245
That way you manage to make each
and every person feel important.

47:12.246 --> 47:13.814
Fortune magazine.

47:14.540 --> 47:18.611
To be honest, I'm not surprised
you don't remember me.

47:19.712 --> 47:21.359
Give me a minute.

47:23.007 --> 47:25.860
I started at Hadley a few
months before you left.

47:28.095 --> 47:30.597
One day we crossed
paths in the hallway.

47:30.598 --> 47:34.623
The man I was with pointed you out
and said, "That's the guy to watch."

47:35.353 --> 47:38.377
We met in the cafeteria
a few days later.

47:38.647 --> 47:40.398
I introduced myself.

47:40.399 --> 47:42.817
We talked for a while, actually.

47:42.818 --> 47:45.467
I wanted to see what
the hotshot was like.

47:46.489 --> 47:48.656
That was a stressful
period in my life.

47:48.657 --> 47:52.952
- Can't blame me for not remembering.
- You were very gracious, don't worry.

47:52.953 --> 47:56.148
You bought me a cup of
coffee, and we talked.

47:57.416 --> 48:00.861
I think actually we saw eye to
eye on quite a few things.

48:01.253 --> 48:05.131
I think you might have enjoyed talking
to someone of like mind for once.

48:05.132 --> 48:07.781
And you kept up with me?
In the papers?

48:08.511 --> 48:11.410
Like the man said, I watched you.

48:12.890 --> 48:14.516
Like the man said.

48:14.517 --> 48:16.184
And that's it?

48:16.185 --> 48:18.128
That's why it's me?

48:19.355 --> 48:22.148
- Let's go, Wayne.
- I worked hard my whole life.

48:22.149 --> 48:25.318
Everything I've got, I've earned.
Nobody handed it to me.

48:25.319 --> 48:26.591
I don't deserve this.

48:29.156 --> 48:31.008
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

48:33.327 --> 48:34.770
What...

49:26.213 --> 49:27.986
You all right?

49:29.175 --> 49:31.494
I think that was my wife.

49:34.346 --> 49:36.164
I have something for that.

49:48.903 --> 49:52.303
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to hurt you.

49:55.201 --> 49:58.145
So, what's the plan
when you're done here?

49:59.455 --> 50:01.182
I'm going away.

50:03.459 --> 50:06.563
- Someplace hot?
- That's right.

50:07.087 --> 50:09.861
I'm taking my wife away from here.

50:10.466 --> 50:12.842
Get back to the way you were.

50:12.843 --> 50:14.844
That's right.

50:14.845 --> 50:16.663
I see.

50:18.098 --> 50:21.543
- So she'll go with you?
- Of course she will.

50:22.770 --> 50:24.747
And give up everything for you?

50:25.689 --> 50:28.167
Leave her father behind,
and the kids?

50:29.860 --> 50:31.132
They'll be all right.

50:34.448 --> 50:36.642
She'll miss them.

50:38.911 --> 50:40.979
You can't go back, Arnold.

50:42.998 --> 50:46.398
My wife doesn't look at me the
way she did 30 years ago.

50:48.420 --> 50:50.238
Nothing you can do about that.

51:31.005 --> 51:32.778
Is there...

51:33.757 --> 51:35.780
...any news about Wayne?

51:37.344 --> 51:38.787
No.

51:39.680 --> 51:44.058
You know, the FBI came to, um...
To speak to me.

51:44.059 --> 51:48.130
- How can anyone be so cruel?
- When did you see him last?

51:48.439 --> 51:50.212
It was a while ago.

51:52.735 --> 51:57.841
I didn't... I didn't know he'd
started seeing you again.

51:58.365 --> 52:00.092
I'm sorry.

52:04.246 --> 52:06.644
I mean, what was it like
when he was here?

52:08.208 --> 52:09.709
I want to know.

52:09.710 --> 52:13.314
Did he bring you things?
Were you in bed?

52:16.258 --> 52:18.861
Sometimes he'd bring me things.

52:19.303 --> 52:20.529
What things?

52:21.889 --> 52:23.491
He brought me that book.

52:27.645 --> 52:29.292
He hates New York.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.125
Um... I've never been.

52:35.986 --> 52:38.214
You know, when I left the company,

52:40.324 --> 52:42.017
he helped me with this place.

52:44.078 --> 52:47.914
And then he just started

52:47.915 --> 52:51.315
coming around now and then,
you know, to see how I was.

52:53.295 --> 52:55.397
We were here for each other.

52:56.757 --> 52:59.861
I think I'd prefer if you'd
been fucking in hotels.

53:02.429 --> 53:04.702
You know, Eileen...

53:06.642 --> 53:09.621
I don't know what I would
have done without him.

53:11.730 --> 53:13.832
He's a great man.

53:40.801 --> 53:42.593
I went to see her.

53:42.594 --> 53:44.162
I know.

53:48.892 --> 53:52.311
You know, I never talked to him
about it. I never asked him why.

53:52.312 --> 53:56.816
I just told him to get rid of her,
and we got on with our life.

53:56.817 --> 53:58.919
I didn't want to know.

54:02.114 --> 54:04.967
I love him, and she admires him.

54:10.456 --> 54:13.184
They may allow your husband
to watch the news.

54:15.669 --> 54:17.271
(CHATTERING)

54:19.423 --> 54:20.945
REPORTER: Hey!

55:13.560 --> 55:15.412
What are you doing?

55:23.195 --> 55:25.343
I'm tired, Arnold.

55:29.743 --> 55:32.411
There's a stream up ahead.

55:32.412 --> 55:35.231
You can soak your feet in
the water. It'll feel good.

55:46.468 --> 55:49.011
How long you been married?

55:49.012 --> 55:51.080
24 years.

55:52.933 --> 55:54.285
She stood by you.

55:56.103 --> 55:57.671
Yes.

55:58.188 --> 55:59.790
You're a lucky man.

56:07.114 --> 56:08.761
Would you do something for me?

56:12.202 --> 56:15.932
Would you mail a letter for me?
To my wife?

56:17.624 --> 56:19.584
You could mail it when you go home.

56:19.585 --> 56:23.315
I might not get along too well
with the guys at the cabin

56:23.797 --> 56:25.945
and I'd like to tell her something.

56:28.802 --> 56:30.745
You can do that for me.

56:42.357 --> 56:45.192
Shit. Would you...

56:45.193 --> 56:47.716
Please, could you cut me free?

56:58.999 --> 57:01.022
You can read what I write.

57:02.002 --> 57:06.357
I won't say anything about
you or where we are.

57:37.746 --> 57:41.817
Be careful where you mail it,
so they can't trace the postmark.

57:48.882 --> 57:52.077
After we were married and
she was pregnant with Tim,

57:53.637 --> 57:56.847
she sometimes had this feeling
when I'd walk out of a room,

57:56.848 --> 57:59.417
like maybe I wasn't coming back.

58:01.895 --> 58:04.965
I traveled a lot with
the businesses then

58:06.900 --> 58:11.631
and I think she got over it.
I don't think she suffered much.

58:17.327 --> 58:20.037
When I asked her to marry me,

58:20.038 --> 58:21.956
I wasn't completely sure.

58:21.957 --> 58:23.900
I had my doubts.

58:26.211 --> 58:28.671
But I...

58:28.672 --> 58:31.742
I couldn't imagine
my life without her.

58:34.344 --> 58:36.321
And that's never changed.

58:43.353 --> 58:46.731
I think that's the same

58:46.732 --> 58:48.425
as being sure.

58:49.484 --> 58:51.052
You think?

58:52.279 --> 58:53.881
I don't know.

58:55.615 --> 58:57.388
I think it is.

59:01.455 --> 59:02.852
We can go now.

59:13.383 --> 59:15.030
We have a demand.

59:17.345 --> 59:19.163
Do you recognize these?

59:29.399 --> 59:32.503
The demand comes to
approximately $10 million.

59:33.653 --> 59:36.822
They've requested that you,
Eileen, deliver the ransom.

59:36.823 --> 59:40.493
It's 9.5 in diamonds,
2 karat, round D flawless.

59:40.494 --> 59:43.329
The most common stones on
the market, easy to move.

59:43.330 --> 59:46.624
And half a million in
non-sequential 100-dollar bills.

59:46.625 --> 59:48.918
Why do they want my mother to go?

59:48.919 --> 59:50.920
We can't send an
agent in her place.

59:50.921 --> 59:52.755
They know what she looks like.

59:52.756 --> 59:56.175
They've requested that we put the
ransom in Wayne's sports bag.

59:56.176 --> 01:00:00.429
The lining's too thin for us to put
in a tracking device of any range.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.765
I advise you not to pay the ransom

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:05.415
without confirmation that
your husband's all right.

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:13.192
Eileen, they've given us three
days to get the stones together.

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:15.861
Tell them you need more time.
Tell them you need proof

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:18.135
that your husband is alive.

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:31.001
Do you know how you do something

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:34.447
completely beyond the realm
of your normal behavior?

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:37.029
How?

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:43.055
You imagine it. Every piece of it.
Until it feels real.

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:44.999
Like something you do all the time.

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:47.560
I wasn't nervous this morning.

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:49.728
It was like driving to work.

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:51.063
The sky, the weather,

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:55.044
I knew what it was gonna be,
even before I opened my eyes.

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:04.660
They offered me money.
Real money.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:07.310
And all I have to do
is bring you to them.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:11.768
Tell me, Wayne,

01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:15.568
if you were in my shoes,
wouldn't you do it?

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:18.362
No, I wouldn't.

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:21.594
Do you know what it's like
to see your wife go to work

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:23.789
every day instead of
float in her pool?

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.183
- No, I don't.
- Well, it stinks.

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:29.476
It stinks seeing your
life fall apart.

01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:32.229
Everything you planned for,
everything you counted on.

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:35.566
To see it happen and not
be able to do anything,

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:38.341
as if you'd become invisible.

01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:44.783
You don't know what I'm
talking about, do you?

01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:46.136
Do you?

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.727
My mother was sick
when I was growing up.

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:57.739
My father worked in a mill
just like everybody else.

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:02.468
He should have done something
else with his life

01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:05.618
but he accepted his
place in the world.

01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:10.893
People would try to get him
to settle their arguments,

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:12.871
whatever the argument.

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:14.919
He was above it.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:23.697
- He knew everything.
- It's a nice story...

01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:25.366
Hey, goddamn it, listen to me!

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:26.844
I listened to you.

01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:32.331
And when he got sick,

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:35.459
they'd come around the house,
stand by the bed

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.483
and try to brighten his mood.

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:41.240
And after he died,

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.121
they raised a glass to him, came by
the house to see if they could help.

01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:51.034
And even though he was dead,

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:55.042
felt like he hung around.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:01.424
Now, all of a sudden,
he really was dead.

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:06.387
He might not have lived for anybody
except my sick mother and me.

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:08.055
Just the two of us.

01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:12.939
But we missed him.

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:15.775
Really missed him.

01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:23.320
I don't know that
I've even got that.

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:34.744
So all you have to do
is just take me to them.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.734
You think they'll let me go,
once they know I've seen your face?

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:44.528
What about you?
Think they're gonna let you go?

01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:45.972
It'll be all right, Wayne.

01:03:46.448 --> 01:03:48.095
No, it won't.

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:51.519
No, it won't.

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:02.898
(GUN COCKS)

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:10.534
You don't understand, Wayne.

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:15.893
I understand.

01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:18.562
Look at you. You don't
even have any shoes on.

01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:21.106
I understand there's
plenty of people like you.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:23.359
You think this is for your wife?

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.612
You think if you steal my money,
go to some beach someplace,

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:28.614
your life won't be such a waste?

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:30.199
This is for you, Arnold.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.451
This is what you amount to.

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:34.578
Because the truth is,
you can't make it yourself.

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:36.914
And my family is gonna
suffer because of you?
