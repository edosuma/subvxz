00:11.916 --> 00:12.916
<i>A Neoprimitive.</i>

00:12.916 --> 00:14.791
<i>Someone who believes</i>

00:14.791 --> 00:16.083
<i>that we've ruined the world
by trying to save it.</i>

00:18.083 --> 00:19.583
<i>Your family,</i>

00:19.583 --> 00:20.916
they were killed brutally.

00:20.916 --> 00:22.916
This is all quite distressing.

00:22.916 --> 00:25.125
You want to kill him, don't you?

00:25.125 --> 00:26.416
Oh, very much so.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.833
<i>You can be
my ally or my enemy.</i>

00:29.833 --> 00:31.791
<i>I assure you,</i>

00:31.791 --> 00:33.291
it's not easy being my enemy.

00:37.083 --> 00:38.416
<i>Anything going on in your life,</i>

00:38.416 --> 00:40.708
new or out of the ordinary?

01:05.000 --> 01:05.958
Whoa.

01:05.958 --> 01:07.583
Jesus.

01:07.583 --> 01:08.666
I missed you, too.

01:08.666 --> 01:09.583
What are you doing?

01:09.583 --> 01:10.958
Just saying hello.

01:12.208 --> 01:13.291
Shall I review?

01:13.291 --> 01:14.958
I prefer to live face forward.

01:14.958 --> 01:18.083
Ass to the past. Let bygones
be bygones, and all that.

01:18.083 --> 01:19.583
I tried to greet you
on my first day here,

01:19.583 --> 01:20.833
and you cut me dead.

01:20.833 --> 01:22.791
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, and then there was

01:22.791 --> 01:24.958
that charming letter
on my desk the next morning.

01:24.958 --> 01:26.291
I still have it somewhere,

01:26.291 --> 01:27.875
if you'd like me
to quote verbatim.

01:27.875 --> 01:29.125
Off the top of my head,

01:29.125 --> 01:31.041
without immediate
recourse to the text:

01:31.041 --> 01:33.083
"If you ever fucking
speak to me again,

01:33.083 --> 01:36.083
I will scratch your eyes out,
you selfish, conniving bitch."

01:36.083 --> 01:38.958
It was "cunt," I believe.

01:38.958 --> 01:40.833
Bitch. I'm quite certain.

01:40.833 --> 01:42.541
Well, it seems
like I would've gone

01:42.541 --> 01:44.291
with the alliteration
of "conniving cunt."

01:45.333 --> 01:47.125
Another missed opportunity.

01:47.125 --> 01:50.041
Yeah, like this one,
if you walk away.

01:50.041 --> 01:52.791
Chance to have a drink,
old times' sake?

01:54.166 --> 01:57.791
- I'm married.
- Well, belated congratulations.

01:57.791 --> 01:59.166
What's she like?

01:59.166 --> 02:00.458
He.

02:00.458 --> 02:02.416
Oh, Grace.

02:02.416 --> 02:04.250
Say it is not so.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.708
I have two children.

02:05.708 --> 02:07.875
Fuck.

02:07.875 --> 02:11.583
You poor thing.
Was it a stipulation?

02:20.916 --> 02:23.833
You broke my fucking heart.

02:26.958 --> 02:32.541
<i>I'm a fool to want you ♪</i>

02:35.708 --> 02:38.875
<i>♪ I'm a fool to want you...</i>

02:38.875 --> 02:40.083
One drink,
and then I'm off.

02:40.083 --> 02:41.291
So whatever you want to say,

02:41.291 --> 02:43.625
I suggest you get
straight to it.

02:43.625 --> 02:45.916
I just thought it was time
for an after-action review.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.583
Which makes it sound
like a firefight.

02:47.583 --> 02:49.708
It wasn't?

02:49.708 --> 02:51.083
<i>True ♪</i>

02:51.083 --> 02:54.750
<i>A love that's there ♪</i>

02:54.750 --> 02:57.791
<i>For others, too ♪</i>

02:57.791 --> 03:01.625
<i>♪ I'm a fool to hold you...</i>

03:01.625 --> 03:03.708
I saw an AI therapist for a bit.

03:03.708 --> 03:05.250
After things fell apart with us.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.250
And is that
how you presented the matter?

03:07.250 --> 03:08.708
That things just "fell apart"?

03:08.708 --> 03:11.291
It said the allure--
and the fatal flaw--

03:11.291 --> 03:12.291
of our relationship

03:12.291 --> 03:13.833
was that you were
a bad good-girl,

03:13.833 --> 03:16.166
and I was a good bad-girl.

03:17.416 --> 03:19.541
On the surface, you make
a show of being rather bad,

03:19.541 --> 03:21.708
but deep down, you're almost
frighteningly good.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.125
- And I'm the opposite.
- And did you pay

03:25.125 --> 03:27.125
for that drivel
with actual money?

03:27.125 --> 03:30.083
It helped me.
Quite a bit.

03:30.083 --> 03:32.416
Do you still muck about
with those doll's houses?

03:34.458 --> 03:35.916
Not for years.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.750
The AIT had a theory.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.500
It said it was all about
order and control.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.541
That you came from a place
where you had neither,

03:41.541 --> 03:44.000
and the doll's houses were
a way to compensate.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.875
Miniature worlds in which
you could feel safe.

03:46.875 --> 03:48.958
That sounds like a steaming
pile of horseshit.

03:48.958 --> 03:51.416
You have
a better explanation?

03:53.500 --> 03:56.208
You have to admit
it's an eccentric hobby.

03:56.208 --> 03:59.541
Do you ever find it difficult
to understand people?

03:59.541 --> 04:01.791
You know, what they're thinking,
what they're feeling?

04:02.791 --> 04:04.583
Empathy, you mean?

04:08.083 --> 04:10.166
There's something about

04:10.166 --> 04:12.791
taking a tiny figure
and shifting it about.

04:13.875 --> 04:16.041
Arranging how it's sitting.

04:16.041 --> 04:18.416
What it's looking at.

04:18.416 --> 04:21.375
And it made me feel
like I had access

04:21.375 --> 04:24.791
into another being's inner...

04:24.791 --> 04:26.291
inner life.

04:28.666 --> 04:31.291
And that can feel
rather priceless.

04:31.291 --> 04:34.625
<i>To want you ♪</i>

04:38.250 --> 04:40.958
- <i>♪ Pity me, I need you...</i>
- You gonna kiss me?

04:40.958 --> 04:43.166
Is that what you want?

04:45.916 --> 04:48.833
<i>♪ I know it's wrong...</i>

04:48.833 --> 04:51.666
I have fucking
missed you, Aelita.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.208
You have no idea how much.

04:56.375 --> 04:59.375
Mm. You should've
treated me better.

05:00.708 --> 05:03.750
You-you want an apology?
Is-is that it?

05:03.750 --> 05:05.208
No.

05:05.208 --> 05:09.500
Water under the bridge.
Swept out to sea long ago.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.958
What, then?

05:12.208 --> 05:14.125
Tell me about your job.

05:14.125 --> 05:16.208
- My job?
- Yeah.

05:16.208 --> 05:18.416
What mysteries do you oversee,

05:18.416 --> 05:22.208
down there in your secret burrow
with the big steel door?

05:22.208 --> 05:24.500
- You don't want to hear
about that.
- No, I do.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.541
I do.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.416
<i>...like a giant
petri dish, really.</i>

05:34.416 --> 05:35.833
We can do anything we want here.

05:35.833 --> 05:37.625
Well, we are doing
anything we want.

05:37.625 --> 05:39.666
And it's real?
You're certain of that?

05:39.666 --> 05:41.083
Boggles the mind, doesn't it?

05:41.083 --> 05:42.583
See, we're told
it's like a simulation.

05:42.583 --> 05:43.833
An elaborate...

05:43.833 --> 05:45.500
That's how we're instructed
to explain it.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.500
The data we send down
to you lower-echelon types.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.250
Lower-echelon types?

05:50.250 --> 05:51.500
All right.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.500
And, uh, how many
people have access?

05:53.500 --> 05:54.875
Just my team.

05:54.875 --> 05:57.083
And Dr. Nuland, of course.

05:57.083 --> 05:59.333
As well as the upper tier
security personnel.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.041
So maybe two dozen?

06:02.500 --> 06:04.000
You ready?

06:27.083 --> 06:29.291
We call it the God font.

06:34.875 --> 06:37.666
I can access anything here.

06:37.666 --> 06:39.875
And not just
from the stub, either,

06:39.875 --> 06:42.708
but from the R.I.
in its entirety.

06:42.708 --> 06:44.375
But our data culls--

06:44.375 --> 06:47.250
that's just a grain of sand
on a larger beach.

06:47.250 --> 06:49.791
We're actively altering
conditions in the stub.

06:49.791 --> 06:51.916
We have over
8,000 studies running.

06:51.916 --> 06:53.500
Researching what?

06:53.500 --> 06:55.958
It would be difficult to name
a field without a foothold.

06:55.958 --> 06:59.791
Botany, meteorology,
zoology, genetics,

06:59.791 --> 07:03.250
oceanography,
robotics, forestry...

07:03.250 --> 07:05.041
But the truly exciting stuff,

07:05.041 --> 07:07.291
the hush-hush,
saving-the-world shit?

07:07.291 --> 07:10.250
That comes from our
Behavioral Mod Department.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.083
They set up a shell
company in the stub

07:12.083 --> 07:14.375
which bid on a contract
with the American military

07:14.375 --> 07:16.833
to install haptic implants
in personnel.

07:16.833 --> 07:18.750
Our tech, more or less,

07:18.750 --> 07:21.208
but on an appropriately
primitive level.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.833
To what end?

07:22.833 --> 07:25.916
Watch. This one's fun.

07:25.916 --> 07:28.208
Let's say we have
a group of elite Marines

07:28.208 --> 07:29.750
at a remote outpost.

07:29.750 --> 07:30.958
They've been told

07:30.958 --> 07:33.583
enemy forces are planning
to use injured animals

07:33.583 --> 07:34.958
to draw them into the open.

07:34.958 --> 07:37.666
So, what would these
highly trained young men do

07:37.666 --> 07:40.583
if a wounded dog were to appear
in front of their position?

07:40.583 --> 07:42.666
Shoot it.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.041
But...

07:46.041 --> 07:50.625
if our implants subtly goosed
the subjects' neural chemistry,

07:50.625 --> 07:55.333
increasing electrical activity
in the anterior insular cortex?

07:57.083 --> 07:59.708
Oh. The, uh, compassion center.

08:02.375 --> 08:04.000
Okay.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.916
Which one?

08:08.916 --> 08:11.000
All of them.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.375
Now, that's where it gets
really interesting.

08:13.375 --> 08:15.750
You see, they all
react differently,

08:15.750 --> 08:17.416
based on their...
their personal histories,

08:17.416 --> 08:18.583
their life experiences.

08:18.583 --> 08:19.833
The mystery of character.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.041
- Is he...
- Wait for it.

08:25.875 --> 08:27.125
Stop him.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.208
- Stop him.
- It's already happened, luv.

08:31.208 --> 08:32.916
Long ago.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.583
I mean, you can imagine
the implications.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.250
Implementing
a similar modification

08:39.250 --> 08:40.625
on a societal level.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.500
I mean, say goodbye
to mob violence.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.500
- Say goodbye to...
- You can't do that.

08:46.250 --> 08:49.541
I mean, they're people.
They're real people.

08:49.541 --> 08:50.958
You see?

08:50.958 --> 08:53.833
So frighteningly good.

09:03.916 --> 09:07.208
Is she planning on implementing
something like that here?

09:07.208 --> 09:09.000
Would you believe me
if I said no?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.291
- Has she already?
- Again,

09:11.291 --> 09:13.333
would you believe me
if I said no?

09:19.208 --> 09:20.375
Good evening.

09:25.208 --> 09:26.833
Wait.

09:35.083 --> 09:38.083
You're from Grains and Legumes?

09:38.083 --> 09:39.583
Yeah, that's right.

09:39.583 --> 09:40.833
Would you mind explaining

09:40.833 --> 09:42.083
your presence here,

09:42.083 --> 09:44.500
where you assuredly have
no fucking right to be?

09:45.583 --> 09:46.875
I'm sorry?

09:46.875 --> 09:48.791
You lack clearance
for this floor.

09:48.791 --> 09:51.250
- Oh, um, I was just...
- You know who I am?

09:52.833 --> 09:54.708
Of course, Dr. Hogart.

09:54.708 --> 09:56.583
Well, then,
perhaps you can explain why

09:56.583 --> 09:58.666
you're addressing an old and
rather dear friend of mine

09:58.666 --> 10:00.791
in such an unacceptably
rude manner?

10:00.791 --> 10:03.041
I am simply doing my job, ma'am.

10:03.041 --> 10:05.666
Her presence on this floor
would seem to require an...

10:05.666 --> 10:08.208
We met upstairs.
But I forgot my jacket.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.791
So I brought her
back down with me.

10:09.791 --> 10:11.958
Under my supervision

10:11.958 --> 10:13.500
and as my guest.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.750
You may file a report
on the matter, if you wish.

10:15.750 --> 10:18.833
But please take care
to sign your name.

10:18.833 --> 10:21.833
So I'll know who to address
my grievance against.

10:22.875 --> 10:25.125
I don't think that will be
necessary, Doctor.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.083
But I will ask that
you not do this again.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.875
Excuse me.

10:37.458 --> 10:39.333
I-I just want to say you have

10:39.333 --> 10:42.375
the most extraordinary eyes.

10:43.875 --> 10:45.083
Seriously.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.333
I...

10:46.333 --> 10:48.000
I'd kill for eyes like that.

14:28.583 --> 14:29.583
what you're talking about.

14:29.583 --> 14:30.666
<i>I'm talking about</i>

14:30.666 --> 14:32.458
Bob the Butcher O'Connell.

14:32.458 --> 14:35.458
- I don't know who that is.
- <i>Dublin lad.</i>

14:35.458 --> 14:38.250
<i>Made his name
killing three UDA fighters</i>

14:38.250 --> 14:40.291
<i>on the eve of his 18th birthday.</i>

14:40.291 --> 14:42.416
<i>Racked up quite
an impressive body count</i>

14:42.416 --> 14:44.083
<i>before fleeing the country.</i>

14:44.083 --> 14:46.375
<i>Do you ever count them up
in the night, Bob?</i>

14:46.375 --> 14:48.375
<i>All those poor souls</i>

14:48.375 --> 14:51.041
<i>you've cut free
from their fleshly prisons?</i>

14:51.041 --> 14:52.541
Who the fuck is this?

14:52.541 --> 14:53.875
<i>Your new employer.</i>

14:53.875 --> 14:56.166
<i>I tried a hammer,
and it didn't work.</i>

14:56.166 --> 14:58.750
So I'm looking for
a better tool.

14:58.750 --> 15:00.875
A scalpel, if you will.

15:00.875 --> 15:03.083
<i>You've been both in your time,
haven't you, Bob?</i>

15:03.083 --> 15:05.416
Seriously, buddy.
You got the wrong number.

15:05.416 --> 15:06.791
<i>Well, I guess I must have</i>

15:06.791 --> 15:08.625
<i>Tommy Giorno's number wrong,
too, then.</i>

15:08.625 --> 15:11.750
<i>Which is a shame, because I was
planning on calling him next.</i>

15:11.750 --> 15:14.458
Maybe tell him
about your daughter.

15:14.458 --> 15:17.000
<i>In that
little bungalow of hers.</i>

15:17.000 --> 15:19.875
<i>Baton Rouge, isn't it?</i>

15:19.875 --> 15:22.958
<i>Do I have
your attention now, Bob?</i>

15:26.625 --> 15:28.416
Who do
you want dead?

15:49.833 --> 15:52.291
All right, Flynne.
You ready?

15:52.291 --> 15:53.583
Yeah.

16:00.750 --> 16:03.166
- Yeah!
- Oh, baby!

16:03.166 --> 16:06.791
Frank's back in the house.

16:09.291 --> 16:10.625
Okay, who's up?

16:10.625 --> 16:12.291
- I think it's Tony.
- Let's go.

16:12.291 --> 16:14.083
- Bring 'em home, Tony.
- I didn't get up there.

16:14.083 --> 16:16.083
All right, buddy,
you got this.

16:18.541 --> 16:21.791
- You got it. All right.
- Back in a sec.

16:21.791 --> 16:23.375
Okay.

16:26.916 --> 16:27.833
Beer, Janet.

16:27.833 --> 16:29.500
And one for my friend.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.500
There you are.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.166
Looking pretty fit
for an old man.

16:37.166 --> 16:38.250
Takes more effort

16:38.250 --> 16:39.791
than it used to,
that's for sure.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.583
Like everything else.

16:42.583 --> 16:44.875
You surprised to see me?

16:46.250 --> 16:49.000
Figured you might pop up.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.625
Not here, though.

16:50.625 --> 16:53.166
This is a bad play, Bobby.

16:53.166 --> 16:54.875
You know how I am.

16:54.875 --> 16:57.166
Always a sucker
for the long odds.

17:01.208 --> 17:02.416
My boys.

17:07.208 --> 17:09.500
Looks like they're all grown up.

17:10.541 --> 17:13.083
The years rush by, don't they?

17:13.083 --> 17:16.541
My daughter,
she's all grown up, too.

17:18.291 --> 17:20.291
I might've let it slide,
Frank, you know,

17:20.291 --> 17:21.875
for old time's sake,

17:21.875 --> 17:24.291
if you'd left her out of it.

17:28.083 --> 17:30.250
The way the guy laid it out...

17:30.250 --> 17:32.541
- Who?
- I don't know.
Voice on the phone.

17:32.541 --> 17:34.083
Some Brit.

17:34.083 --> 17:36.750
- He said it was you or me.
- Girls, go freshen up.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.500
I ain't proud
of myself, Bobby.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.625
I'm fucking ashamed
is what I am.

17:44.541 --> 17:45.666
Mr. O'Connell?

17:45.666 --> 17:49.666
Holy shit.
Yeah, we thought it was you.

17:49.666 --> 17:51.791
- That's enough, folks.
- Give us
a minute, boys.

17:51.791 --> 17:54.208
- We've got some things
to talk about.
- No.

17:54.208 --> 17:57.041
I think we'll walk
Mr. O'Connell to his car.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.000
What do you say, Bob?

18:04.208 --> 18:06.416
I loved you
like a brother, Frank.

18:12.416 --> 18:13.416
Gun, gun, gun!

18:15.333 --> 18:17.958
<i>'Cause I know we can ♪</i>

18:19.833 --> 18:24.125
<i>♪ Let's make it something
to shout about ♪</i>

18:24.125 --> 18:25.958
<i>Come on and take my hand ♪</i>

19:04.000 --> 19:05.500

19:05.500 --> 19:06.625
I know the what.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.625
The why doesn't matter.

19:08.625 --> 19:11.000
The how is what
you're paying me for.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.208
I need a where
and a when to get it done.

19:13.208 --> 19:14.791
<i>Your targets will be here
tomorrow morning</i>

19:14.791 --> 19:16.208
<i>for a medical procedure</i>

19:16.208 --> 19:18.791
<i>that should take
no longer than an hour.</i>

19:18.791 --> 19:22.208
- What type of procedure?
- <i>A spinal tap.</i>

19:22.208 --> 19:24.166
<i>After which, they'll return
to their residence,</i>

19:24.166 --> 19:25.416
<i>here.</i>

19:25.416 --> 19:28.000
<i>The rest I leave to you, Bob.</i>

19:42.208 --> 19:44.791
For fuck's sake.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.916
Oh, no.

20:09.916 --> 20:12.708
Could've just stayed
inside, son, you know?

20:12.708 --> 20:14.375
Pretended to be dead.

20:14.375 --> 20:16.791
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

20:16.791 --> 20:18.416
I'm gonna get in this car here.

20:18.416 --> 20:20.916
And if I can get it to start
after your little fusillade,

20:20.916 --> 20:22.333
then I'll be gone.

20:22.333 --> 20:25.083
Now, if you can manage
to crawl free before that,

20:25.083 --> 20:27.250
I'll consider us even.

20:27.250 --> 20:30.041
For your father's sake.

20:30.041 --> 20:32.708
How does that sound?

20:33.875 --> 20:37.333
I can't move my legs.

20:40.458 --> 20:42.666
That arm doesn't look
too great, either.

20:45.625 --> 20:47.125
Good luck.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.125
Oh, please.

21:06.791 --> 21:08.833
Fuck.

21:10.666 --> 21:12.125
Fuck! Don't!

22:23.375 --> 22:25.250
- What did you do, Jasper?
- What?

22:25.250 --> 22:26.708
Did I or did I not

22:26.708 --> 22:29.208
explicitly tell you
not to take any of that money?

22:29.208 --> 22:31.375
I didn't.

22:31.375 --> 22:33.291
So, this-this just
magically fucking showed up

22:33.291 --> 22:34.708
in your jacket pocket?

22:34.708 --> 22:37.208
Whoa, babe.
My uncle gave it to me.

22:38.541 --> 22:39.750
For what?

22:40.750 --> 22:41.958
Huh?

22:41.958 --> 22:44.333
Did you ask him
what he wanted in exchange?

22:47.958 --> 22:49.625
Of-of course.

22:49.625 --> 22:51.666
I'm not a fucking idiot.

22:51.666 --> 22:52.875
And?

22:55.166 --> 22:56.583
He doesn't want nothing for it.

22:56.583 --> 22:59.333
It was just...
a gesture of gratitude

22:59.333 --> 23:01.541
for all my years of hard work.

23:01.541 --> 23:03.583
Seriously, babe.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.541
No strings attached.

23:05.541 --> 23:06.875
That's it.

23:06.875 --> 23:08.458
Nothing's for free, Jasper.

23:11.541 --> 23:14.125
Well, I can give it back,
you want.

23:25.916 --> 23:27.375
No, no.

23:27.375 --> 23:29.083
I guess we can use it.

23:35.541 --> 23:37.541
- Could've told me
last night, though.
- I know.

23:37.541 --> 23:40.541
- Saved me a panic attack
this morning.
- I'm sorry.

23:41.833 --> 23:43.583
There's some coffee
left in the pot,

23:43.583 --> 23:45.375
- if you want it.
- Thanks.

23:47.041 --> 23:48.500
Have a good day.

24:04.333 --> 24:06.958
You're 100% sure about this?

24:06.958 --> 24:09.458
Absolutely.
It's bacterial.

24:09.458 --> 24:11.708
The oddest thing
I've ever encountered.

24:11.708 --> 24:13.458
Little bit like meningitis,

24:13.458 --> 24:16.916
just extremely localized.
In her occipital lobe.

24:16.916 --> 24:19.333
- Which is what again?
- It's basically

24:19.333 --> 24:21.916
the part of the brain
involved in seeing.

24:21.916 --> 24:24.375
A lumbar puncture will
at least give us some idea

24:24.375 --> 24:27.958
of what kind of bacteria you got
throwing a party in there.

24:29.916 --> 24:31.875
It looks scarier than it is.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.500
All right, you might feel
some pressure here.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.125
- Mm-hmm.
- It shouldn't hurt at all,

24:39.125 --> 24:41.375
but by all means, feel free
to hold your brother's hand.

24:41.375 --> 24:42.916
I won't judge.

24:54.458 --> 24:56.000
There.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.125
- Wasn't so bad, was it?
- Just peachy.

25:40.416 --> 25:42.083
- Hello?
-  <i>Ms. Andrews?</i>

25:42.083 --> 25:46.333
<i>This is Derek Thompson of the
Appleview Insurance Company.</i>

25:46.333 --> 25:47.708
I'm sorry to bother you,

25:47.708 --> 25:49.750
but I'm afraid we've had
to cancel your policy.

25:51.833 --> 25:53.375
When is this change effective?

25:53.375 --> 25:54.750
<i>Immediately, I'm afraid.</i>

25:54.750 --> 25:57.541
I'd make other arrangements
as soon as possible.

25:57.541 --> 25:59.041
And with great care.

25:59.041 --> 26:00.541
<i>My husband and I</i>

26:00.541 --> 26:04.208
had hoped to continue our
relationship with Appleview.

26:04.208 --> 26:06.291
I-If we can?

26:06.291 --> 26:08.875
<i>I'm afraid that might
not be possible, ma'am.</i>

26:08.875 --> 26:11.833
There's a chance Appleview
may be closing its doors soon.

26:11.833 --> 26:13.333
For good.

26:13.333 --> 26:14.708
Jesus, Dad.

26:14.708 --> 26:16.458
<i>But I want to say
that we have valued</i>

26:16.458 --> 26:18.791
<i>our relationship with you.</i>

26:18.791 --> 26:21.125
More than you can
possibly know. I...

26:22.583 --> 26:24.666
<i>And we wish you and your husband</i>

26:24.666 --> 26:27.583
- <i>health and happiness
in all things.</i>
- I'm pregnant.

26:30.333 --> 26:34.541
Well... [exhales] Well,
that's wonderful news, ma'am.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.166
<i>Goodbye.</i>

26:38.166 --> 26:39.875
And good luck.

27:51.791 --> 27:53.166
You all right, sir?

27:53.166 --> 27:54.416
Just a bit of car trouble.

27:54.416 --> 27:55.708
I'll be fine, thanks.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.000
You want me to take a look?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.041
Well, that's awfully kind
of you, young lady.

27:59.041 --> 28:01.583
But, uh,
I've already called it in.

28:01.583 --> 28:03.875
Mechanic should be
along here any minute now.

28:03.875 --> 28:05.541
Who they sending?
Charlie Burr?

28:05.541 --> 28:07.250
I don't believe
they gave me a name.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.666
Yeah, I'll bet it's Charlie.

28:09.666 --> 28:12.333
I could maybe save you whatever
ransom he'll end up charging.

28:12.333 --> 28:15.125
I appreciate it.
But, uh...

28:15.125 --> 28:16.916
- I'll take my chances.
- This wouldn't be

28:16.916 --> 28:18.083
one of those situations

28:18.083 --> 28:19.458
where you're looking at me
and thinking

28:19.458 --> 28:21.166
I can't fix a car
'cause I'm a woman, would it?

28:21.166 --> 28:23.208
No, ma'am.

28:23.208 --> 28:24.583
I can take one look at you

28:24.583 --> 28:26.333
and guess you'd know
your way around an engine.

28:26.333 --> 28:28.333
I honestly can't tell

28:28.333 --> 28:29.791
if that's a compliment
or an insult.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.916
Oh,
I'd never waste an insult

28:31.916 --> 28:33.750
on a stranger, young lady.

28:33.750 --> 28:36.125
I save them up
for friends and family.

28:39.291 --> 28:41.333
Okay. Well,
good luck to you, sir.

28:41.333 --> 28:43.083
Take care, now.

29:05.625 --> 29:09.416
Let-let me just take
a quick look on the off chance

29:09.416 --> 29:10.458
I can one-up Charlie.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.958
I-I got some history with him,

29:11.958 --> 29:13.500
which I won't bore you sharing,

29:13.500 --> 29:15.625
but sending a little grief
his way would make my morning.

29:15.625 --> 29:17.166
You don't mind, do you?

29:17.166 --> 29:18.333
I'd, uh, actually

29:18.333 --> 29:19.916
just as soon wait.

29:21.625 --> 29:24.500
- What happened?
- Gravel truck overturned.

29:24.500 --> 29:27.250
Almost like getting hit
by buckshot.

29:27.250 --> 29:28.625
Not a pleasant experience,

29:28.625 --> 29:30.083
- I can assure you.
- Whoo-whee.

29:30.083 --> 29:31.416
You're having quite a day.

29:31.416 --> 29:33.583
You're telling me.

29:35.541 --> 29:38.250
And just getting started, too.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.500
Okay, I'm gonna give you
a friendly warning here, mister.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.666
If you let Burton Fisher
touch this engine

29:42.666 --> 29:44.166
when you wouldn't let me,

29:44.166 --> 29:46.250
I might have to just go
and shoot you both.

29:46.250 --> 29:48.583
Tell me
you didn't run

29:48.583 --> 29:50.750
into this man with that
tired-looking truck of yours,

29:50.750 --> 29:53.791
- Billy Ann.
- Just trying to be
a Good Samaritan here, Burton.

29:53.791 --> 29:55.208
But some folks
can't seem to believe

29:55.208 --> 29:57.458
a woman might know
how to fix a car.

29:57.458 --> 30:00.125
I think the young lady
simply misunderstood me.

30:00.125 --> 30:03.541
I, uh, I apologize
for all the fuss.

30:03.541 --> 30:05.083
I-I didn't mean to

30:05.083 --> 30:07.583
offend anybody or I was, um...

30:07.583 --> 30:10.875
I guess a bit flustered,
to be honest.

30:10.875 --> 30:12.416
Shoot him.

30:13.666 --> 30:15.166
Shoot him now.

30:15.166 --> 30:16.708
Get down!

30:34.916 --> 30:36.625
Shit.

30:36.625 --> 30:38.583
You okay?

30:38.583 --> 30:40.666
Burton, Burton! Shit.

30:42.833 --> 30:45.000
Fuck. I'm stuck. Fuck.

31:08.791 --> 31:11.125
You all right? Knife.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.750
Fuck. Burton!

31:18.625 --> 31:20.166
Pretty good with a shotgun, too.

31:20.166 --> 31:21.250
Want to see?

31:42.708 --> 31:44.500
Next one's in the head, old man.

32:15.625 --> 32:17.208
Flynne?

32:23.250 --> 32:26.125
This what you do
to suspects, ain't it?

32:26.125 --> 32:28.291
Break 'em up?

32:28.291 --> 32:30.458
Talk to 'em one-on-one,
get the story straight?

32:30.458 --> 32:31.583
Witnesses, too, Flynne.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.916
Now, what about victims, Tommy?

32:36.625 --> 32:40.708
You, uh, you got any idea
what this is?

32:40.708 --> 32:43.333
I don't know. Hell, I mean,
it looks like it's almost

32:43.333 --> 32:45.083
something from the...

32:45.083 --> 32:47.083
future, you know?

32:47.083 --> 32:50.291
Yeah,
it does, don't it?

32:53.166 --> 32:56.291
Well, he hasn't said a peep.

32:56.291 --> 33:00.583
No ID, no registration, nothing.

33:01.625 --> 33:02.958
But he is wearing a vest.

33:02.958 --> 33:04.458
And?

33:06.500 --> 33:09.666
Makes it feel like he was
expecting a fight, don't it?

33:09.666 --> 33:12.250
Sort of like Burton seems to be.

33:12.250 --> 33:16.166
Driving around, all geared up
like he's still off in Texas.

33:16.166 --> 33:18.708
Weapons, drones,
all ready to go?

33:21.833 --> 33:24.458
If he wanted him dead, Tommy,
you know he would have done it.

33:25.916 --> 33:29.166
But he didn't.
We called you instead.

33:30.666 --> 33:31.833
I know that.

33:33.083 --> 33:35.541
But I can't help thinking...

33:35.541 --> 33:37.750
you know, a dead body
on this bridge?

33:37.750 --> 33:39.583
Y'all got Homeland
Security showing up.

33:39.583 --> 33:44.000
Whereas just some bullets
flying, without a corpse?

33:45.041 --> 33:47.375
Well, that remains
a local matter, now, don't it?

33:51.583 --> 33:53.708
We're not doing
anything wrong, okay?

33:57.000 --> 33:58.208
Promise you.

34:13.916 --> 34:16.458
You know what my first
memory of you is, Flynne?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.500
My very first?

34:21.250 --> 34:24.375
I was in the third grade.

34:24.375 --> 34:26.416
So you must've been in first.

34:28.291 --> 34:32.250
And they had you down at the
principal's office in a rage.

34:32.250 --> 34:33.875
Remember?

34:33.875 --> 34:37.041
'Cause somehow,
you managed to take

34:37.041 --> 34:39.833
all the earthworms
from the science room

34:39.833 --> 34:41.791
and dumped them in the woods.

34:43.375 --> 34:46.916
Couldn't bear to have the fifth
graders dissecting them.

34:51.125 --> 34:54.333
Made quite the impression,
I'll tell you what.

34:58.333 --> 35:01.166
My uncle had a saying,

35:01.166 --> 35:05.333
how people are
a lot like onions.

35:05.333 --> 35:08.791
One skin grows
over another, year by year.

35:11.583 --> 35:14.791
Which would mean
that little girl,

35:14.791 --> 35:16.833
who freed all them worms...

35:19.166 --> 35:20.958
...she's still inside you.

35:22.500 --> 35:26.291
And I can't help but feeling
I ought to protect her if I can.

35:28.666 --> 35:30.583
But I need your help.

35:41.333 --> 35:42.875
I'm sorry, Tommy.

35:49.375 --> 35:51.333
Guess you better, uh...

35:51.333 --> 35:52.916
head on home.

36:31.250 --> 36:32.625
Flynne?

36:33.833 --> 36:36.083
Talk to me, sweet pea.

36:40.166 --> 36:41.375
I don't know.

36:42.875 --> 36:44.833
Thousand ways it could have
gone wrong back there.

36:44.833 --> 36:46.125
Can't dwell
on the past, Flynne.

36:46.125 --> 36:48.250
Got to focus on
what's in front of us.

36:48.250 --> 36:49.916
How, Burton?

36:49.916 --> 36:51.958
When they're always
about ten steps ahead of us?

36:51.958 --> 36:54.458
He was posted up
on that bridge waiting for us.

36:54.458 --> 36:57.041
- He knew that we'd come by.
- Let's just get you home.

36:57.041 --> 36:59.083
Safe and sound.
Then we can talk about it.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.041
No need to censor
yourself around me, Burton.

37:05.041 --> 37:06.541
I know more than you think.

37:07.541 --> 37:10.083
Trips to the future.

37:10.083 --> 37:11.791
Men coming in the night
to attack you.

37:13.625 --> 37:15.833
And you sending Corbell Pickett
a bag full of cash.

37:15.833 --> 37:17.916
Then I guess you can see
how maybe there's a conflict

37:17.916 --> 37:19.708
- of interest at play here,
Billy Ann?
- I think we can agree

37:19.708 --> 37:21.500
we're both interested
in Flynne's well-being.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.625
It's not you
I'm concerned about.

37:26.250 --> 37:28.791
If you're insulting Jasper,
you're insulting me.

37:28.791 --> 37:30.875
And I'd say what just
unfolded ought to buy me

37:30.875 --> 37:33.791
a little trust
and a whole lot of respect.

37:35.416 --> 37:37.875
Jasper would never harm a soul.

37:37.875 --> 37:39.583
Let alone Flynne. Never.

38:02.416 --> 38:03.625
I'm a phone call away.

38:05.541 --> 38:06.958
Thank you.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.458
I didn't say nothing
that wasn't true, Flynne.

38:15.458 --> 38:18.125
Burton, she's a friend
of mine, okay?

38:18.125 --> 38:20.708
And I'd like to think that
she's a friend of yours, too.

38:22.958 --> 38:24.875
Like it or not,

38:24.875 --> 38:28.500
she's involved
in this now, okay?

38:44.291 --> 38:46.791
It's getting real hard
to keep this under wraps.

38:46.791 --> 38:48.333
Billy Ann ain't the problem.

38:48.333 --> 38:50.500
Tommy and his sheriff
badge ain't the solution.

38:50.500 --> 38:52.291
We should have closed
that loop on the bridge.

38:52.291 --> 38:53.583
Yeah, well, you didn't.

38:58.083 --> 38:59.333
Where's Mama?

39:01.083 --> 39:03.791
Mama? Leon?

39:16.875 --> 39:20.000
Oh, no, Burton. The bodies.

39:21.583 --> 39:23.083
Shit.

39:29.791 --> 39:33.125
I'm just struggling
to wrap my head around this.

39:34.875 --> 39:37.000
Medicine sent from the future.

39:38.458 --> 39:40.333
Just the formula for it.

39:40.333 --> 39:42.291
They sent it
to Pharma Jon to print.

39:43.583 --> 39:44.708
Sent how?

39:44.708 --> 39:46.750
Does it matter, Mama?

39:46.750 --> 39:47.958
It worked.

39:51.166 --> 39:54.000
Do you know why
your cousins grew up in Ohio?

39:54.000 --> 39:57.166
'Cause Uncle Charles
lost their farm to the bank.

39:57.166 --> 39:59.333
My daddy told me
that story enough times

39:59.333 --> 40:01.875
for me to grow impatient, too.
But I also took it to heart.

40:01.875 --> 40:03.875
The idea that the worst thing

40:03.875 --> 40:06.750
a person can do is grow
dependent on some outsider.

40:06.750 --> 40:10.875
All they care about is taking
something from your pocket

40:10.875 --> 40:12.791
and putting it in theirs,
and on a regular basis, too.

40:12.791 --> 40:14.708
But we aren't
paying them anything.

40:14.708 --> 40:16.291
They're the ones paying us.

40:16.291 --> 40:18.166
That's what my Uncle
Charles must've thought,

40:18.166 --> 40:19.708
when that loan money came in.

40:21.291 --> 40:23.166
They're giving me these drugs.

40:24.583 --> 40:26.416
What happens
if I stop taking them?

40:30.041 --> 40:31.541
I don't know.

40:31.541 --> 40:33.458
What happens if you stop
paying Corbell Pickett?

40:35.458 --> 40:37.708
Now I-I'm putting aside

40:37.708 --> 40:39.500
all the traveling
to the future part

40:39.500 --> 40:41.500
'cause I suppose I'll need
to think on that for a while

40:41.500 --> 40:43.333
before I find
a way to accept it.

40:43.333 --> 40:45.666
But the dependency seems
simple enough.

40:45.666 --> 40:47.833
And it makes me
worry for all of us.

40:47.833 --> 40:49.750
Because I-I'm just getting
caught up here,

40:49.750 --> 40:51.708
on all the complicated
ins and outs

40:51.708 --> 40:53.166
of what you got going on.

40:53.166 --> 40:54.833
But if it looks to me
like you don't have

40:54.833 --> 40:57.375
that much power
in your current arrangement,

40:57.375 --> 40:59.875
think how it must look to them.

41:13.208 --> 41:14.666
We need
to talk this through.

41:14.666 --> 41:16.083
Burton, I'm done being

41:16.083 --> 41:17.291
- a sitting duck.
- We don't even know

41:17.291 --> 41:18.375
if that headset is safe.

41:18.375 --> 41:20.000
And how safe is it here?

41:20.000 --> 41:21.916
Sitting around, just waiting
for someone to come and get us?

41:50.083 --> 41:52.125
Yes?

41:52.125 --> 41:54.666
<i>The polts have hacked
into the Peripheral.</i>

41:54.666 --> 41:57.208
- <i>Do you want us
to cut the connection?</i>
- No.

42:02.333 --> 42:03.458
This is a pleasant surprise.

42:03.458 --> 42:04.833
No, Wilf.

42:04.833 --> 42:06.583
A surprise is when someone
tries to kill you

42:06.583 --> 42:08.500
out of the blue, which is
what just happened to me.

42:08.500 --> 42:09.708
A whole new person.

42:09.708 --> 42:10.958
And he had one of those

42:10.958 --> 42:12.541
sonic punch things,
like the guy

42:12.541 --> 42:14.166
- from the Research
Institute had.
- I didn't...

42:14.166 --> 42:16.458
You were supposed to
let us know if somebody else

42:16.458 --> 42:17.833
was coming to kill us.

42:17.833 --> 42:19.291
Except you can't only
not do that,

42:19.291 --> 42:21.791
but you didn't even know
it happened after the fact.

42:21.791 --> 42:23.541
So much for your
living-in-the-future wisdom

42:23.541 --> 42:24.541
bullshit, huh?

42:24.541 --> 42:25.875
Flynne. What happened?

42:30.125 --> 42:31.916
It's a fucking mess now.

42:31.916 --> 42:35.208
The Sheriff's
Department's involved.

42:35.208 --> 42:36.916
There's gonna be a lot
of complications, Wilf.

42:40.250 --> 42:41.791
Is everyone okay?

42:46.958 --> 42:48.750
I need to ask you something.

42:50.791 --> 42:52.625
The other day
when we went walking

42:52.625 --> 42:54.250
and you linked up with me...

42:56.000 --> 42:57.750
...did you have another motive?

42:59.333 --> 43:03.166
- I'm not sure I'm following.
- Were you trying to confuse me?

43:04.625 --> 43:06.541
Or...

43:06.541 --> 43:10.333
my emotions, I guess,
with the haptic drift stuff?

43:10.333 --> 43:12.541
Haptic drift?

43:12.541 --> 43:14.958
I-I don't know what that means.

43:14.958 --> 43:16.416
Wilf...

43:18.291 --> 43:20.750
Did you merge with me
so I would start to...

43:23.041 --> 43:25.791
...I don't know,
have feelings for you

43:25.791 --> 43:28.208
that you hadn't
necessarily earned yet?

43:28.208 --> 43:29.875
I'm sorry, Ms. Fisher.

43:29.875 --> 43:33.083
I honestly...

43:33.083 --> 43:34.708
Wilf...

43:38.208 --> 43:39.833
I'm starting to trust you.

43:44.125 --> 43:45.500
Is that a mistake?

43:47.791 --> 43:49.208
No.

43:51.250 --> 43:52.625
No.

44:16.208 --> 44:18.208
How old are you, son?

44:19.916 --> 44:22.750
I'm guessing 28 or so?

44:24.666 --> 44:29.000
I don't read you as ex-military,
for some reason.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
You've probably
never left this town.

44:33.916 --> 44:37.750
Lived a nice, quiet life here,
I imagine.

44:37.750 --> 44:40.875
Well, that's over now.

44:42.125 --> 44:44.000
The quiet part, I mean.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.750
Though maybe
the living part, too,

44:45.750 --> 44:48.041
depending on how this plays out.

44:50.583 --> 44:53.083
You believe there are
moments when fate

44:53.083 --> 44:55.166
can go one way or another?

44:55.166 --> 44:57.166
Like a fork in the road?

44:58.250 --> 44:59.625
'Cause you're at one.

44:59.625 --> 45:01.458
Whether you know it or not.

45:03.250 --> 45:04.750
Now, you can take me
back the station.

45:04.750 --> 45:06.166
You can book me,

45:06.166 --> 45:09.500
you can put my prints
in the system, swab my DNA,

45:09.500 --> 45:11.750
and you set a clock ticking.

45:11.750 --> 45:13.541
On me, for certain.

45:15.291 --> 45:16.708
But on you, too.

45:18.583 --> 45:21.208
Because the people
who'll be coming for me, well,

45:21.208 --> 45:24.333
they're not the sort
to leave loose ends untied.

45:25.375 --> 45:28.416
And me talking to you
like this, well...

45:28.416 --> 45:31.083
I'm afraid that
makes you a loose end.

45:33.333 --> 45:35.666
Goddamn it.

45:35.666 --> 45:37.583
Look at your face.

45:37.583 --> 45:39.500
Don't you ever play poker.

45:39.500 --> 45:41.083
You're too transparent.

45:41.083 --> 45:44.666
I can see the curiosity
building up inside you.

45:44.666 --> 45:46.791
"Who the fuck is this guy?

45:46.791 --> 45:48.500
What's he doing,
coming round here

45:48.500 --> 45:49.750
trying to kill these folks?"

45:51.375 --> 45:53.083
Well, I'll tell you.

45:54.208 --> 45:57.333
Someone said they would
kill my daughter if I didn't.

45:58.583 --> 46:02.083
They also paid me $2.5 million.

46:02.083 --> 46:05.500
First installment
of an eventual ten,

46:05.500 --> 46:07.166
if the job got done right.

46:07.166 --> 46:09.375
Which...

46:09.375 --> 46:12.166
...it didn't, obviously.

46:12.166 --> 46:14.083
Who?

46:14.083 --> 46:16.625
A voice on the phone.
Doesn't matter who.

46:18.583 --> 46:22.375
What matters is
the $2.5 million.

46:22.375 --> 46:23.666
Which is yours...

46:25.583 --> 46:27.083
...if you want it.

46:37.833 --> 46:40.291
What do you say, Deputy, huh?

46:44.083 --> 46:45.333
I say...

47:47.416 --> 47:48.750
Fuck.

48:14.250 --> 48:15.458
<i>I fear
I've made a mistake,</i>

48:15.458 --> 48:16.958
<i>agreeing to bring you here.</i>

48:16.958 --> 48:18.833
I'm questioning

48:18.833 --> 48:20.333
what you might hope
to achieve by going in there.

48:20.333 --> 48:23.291
I want Cherise to know
what it feels like.

48:23.291 --> 48:24.625
To be hunted.

48:26.125 --> 48:27.958
What? You don't think
I can handle her?

48:27.958 --> 48:29.833
Oh, I have no doubt
you can handle her.

48:29.833 --> 48:31.916
It's the afterward
that concerns me.

48:31.916 --> 48:33.458
This isn't fending off
an attacker.

48:33.458 --> 48:35.291
It's being
the assailant yourself.

48:35.291 --> 48:37.208
Which carries
a far heavier weight.

48:37.208 --> 48:39.250
How would you even know?

48:39.250 --> 48:42.958
You're always off in some corner
watching, aren't you?

48:42.958 --> 48:45.458
Did I tell you
how I first met Lev?

48:47.833 --> 48:49.250
When I was 12 years old,

48:49.250 --> 48:50.833
my parents sent me
to boarding school.

48:50.833 --> 48:54.500
We were still crawling out
of the Jackpot at that point.

48:54.500 --> 48:56.666
And there were
some people who didn't like

48:56.666 --> 48:58.875
the way power in
the new world was coalescing.

48:58.875 --> 49:00.583
They saw it as corrupt.

49:00.583 --> 49:02.041
What? Neoprims, you mean?

49:02.041 --> 49:04.166
They attacked the school.

49:05.416 --> 49:08.916
- Why? You were just kids.
- To send our parents a message.

49:08.916 --> 49:12.583
The Neoprims had me serve them
their food at the refectory.

49:14.375 --> 49:15.750
And they failed to notice

49:15.750 --> 49:18.041
when I grabbed a steak knife
off one of their trays.

49:21.416 --> 49:22.958
I slashed their leader's throat.

49:24.416 --> 49:26.541
Then shot
his four companions dead.

49:31.625 --> 49:33.291
It was self-defense, Wilf.

49:33.291 --> 49:35.458
Even self-defense
can be cold-blooded.

49:37.041 --> 49:39.458
I didn't think of the weight...

49:40.708 --> 49:42.166
...because I never
could have imagined it.

49:46.958 --> 49:48.375
Don't go over there.

49:49.625 --> 49:51.541
Unless you realize
what you might have to do.

49:52.791 --> 49:54.125
And you're at peace with it.

50:06.291 --> 50:07.500
How may I be of assistance?

50:09.041 --> 50:11.041
- Has my face been scanned?
- Of course.

50:11.041 --> 50:13.458
That's all the assistance
I'm gonna need.

50:13.458 --> 50:16.458
Ma'am, if you don't
have an appointment...

50:19.833 --> 50:22.708
...I'm afraid I'll need
to call security.

50:22.708 --> 50:24.791
I think I can handle it
from here. Thank you.

50:28.250 --> 50:30.041
Hmm.

50:30.041 --> 50:33.083
I just assumed you'd be taller.

50:34.125 --> 50:35.666
I can only spare a minute, alas.

50:35.666 --> 50:37.750
So perhaps we ought to get
straight down to business.

50:37.750 --> 50:39.916
How can I be of help?

50:39.916 --> 50:42.625
You mean, besides not
killing me and my family?

50:42.625 --> 50:45.666
Well, exactly, because
that's rather nonnegotiable.

50:45.666 --> 50:48.041
The fuck did I ever do to you?

50:48.041 --> 50:49.708
Sticky fingers, dear.

50:49.708 --> 50:53.666
You absconded with
some rather vital data.

50:57.083 --> 50:59.375
Just return it,
and all shall be forgiven.

50:59.375 --> 51:01.708
I didn't take shit from you.

51:01.708 --> 51:05.708
I played my game and died.
Got sent home. End game.

51:05.708 --> 51:08.625
So Aelita West still has it?

51:08.625 --> 51:10.541
I don't know
who the fuck has it.

51:10.541 --> 51:13.750
And quite frankly,
I don't give a shit.

51:13.750 --> 51:17.125
I just need you to leave me
and my family alone.

51:17.125 --> 51:21.666
You're either lying, or
expendable in your ignorance.

51:21.666 --> 51:24.958
Either way, your death
continues to be

51:24.958 --> 51:26.750
my only viable goal.

51:26.750 --> 51:29.583
Now, what makes you
so certain I won't kill you?

51:29.583 --> 51:30.916
Right here?

51:30.916 --> 51:33.833
I mean,
I'm not that careless, dear.

51:33.833 --> 51:36.333
Now, I'm in
a Peripheral of my own.

51:36.333 --> 51:39.000
Ah, that doesn't mean I can't
deal you an awful lot of pain.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.708
Though I do imagine

51:40.708 --> 51:41.791
you'd pop right out
of that thing

51:41.791 --> 51:43.000
at the first sign of trouble.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.583
And why would you say that?

51:45.583 --> 51:48.250
Now, you see, we got people
like you where I'm from.

51:49.375 --> 51:51.500
Folks with power, money,

51:51.500 --> 51:54.791
love to walk all over
the rest of us.

51:54.791 --> 51:57.958
Not the kind to suffer through
anything close to a real fight.

52:00.875 --> 52:02.458
I've lived through
more extremity

52:02.458 --> 52:04.916
than you could possibly imagine.

52:04.916 --> 52:07.416
It would crush
your tiny little mind.

52:07.416 --> 52:11.458
So please, don't care
to lecture me about pain.

52:11.458 --> 52:13.958
Oh, I don't want to lecture you.

52:13.958 --> 52:15.875
I just want to snap
your fucking neck.

52:19.583 --> 52:20.583
Do you feel it?

52:21.791 --> 52:23.541
The darkness closing in?

52:23.541 --> 52:28.166
Let it be preparation
for when I kill you,

52:28.166 --> 52:29.875
and it's real.

52:43.333 --> 52:44.833
Ah!

52:44.833 --> 52:47.000
I got a foothold
in your world now.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
So next time, I'll be
coming for you instead.

53:38.125 --> 53:39.666
<i>There's been a murder</i>

53:39.666 --> 53:40.666
involving a Peripheral.

53:40.666 --> 53:42.125
Well, I suppose
we best get busy.

53:43.041 --> 53:44.625
How come people here
stay so distant to us?

53:44.625 --> 53:45.750
Do this.

53:48.541 --> 53:49.458
<i>You're telling me</i>

53:49.458 --> 53:51.583
your invisible car's missing?

53:51.583 --> 53:53.666
<i>How hard did you hit
that pretty head of yours?</i>

53:54.791 --> 53:57.416
You almost got killed.

53:57.416 --> 53:58.916
Is there something else
you're not telling me?

53:58.916 --> 54:01.708
Whatever you do,
don't lie to her.

54:01.708 --> 54:04.416
It wasn't an accident,
it was more like an ambush.

54:04.416 --> 54:05.708
No, no, no, no, no.
