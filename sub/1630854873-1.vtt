01:29.800 --> 01:31.207
Hey, little Lady.

01:36.135 --> 01:39.336
Hell's coming for breakfast.

01:39.879 --> 01:41.384
Hey, little lady.

01:46.791 --> 01:48.808
Hell's coming for breakfast.

01:57.672 --> 02:02.376
Hey, little lady,
hell is coming for breakfast.

02:21.031 --> 02:22.665
Hey, little lady.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.079
Hell is coming for breakfast.

02:38.312 --> 02:39.528
Hey, little lady.

02:39.625 --> 02:42.343
Hell is coming for breakfast.
I got it.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.159
You've been saying that
for the last forever, Joe.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.305
Am I supposed
to pretend I can't hear?

02:51.783 --> 02:52.936
It's Clint.

02:53.032 --> 02:55.305
I'm sleeping.

03:02.889 --> 03:06.279
So, is it the actual location
that's coming for breakfast

03:06.376 --> 03:08.585
or is hell actually
coming for breakfast?

03:08.681 --> 03:11.912
Like, is it like,
"Get ready, little lady,

03:12.008 --> 03:13.928
Friars Club
is coming for breakfast."

03:14.024 --> 03:15.752
Or is it,
"Hey, little lady,

03:15.848 --> 03:17.768
Walmart is coming
for breakfast,

03:17.864 --> 03:20.328
because I need to know how
many places to set."

03:20.425 --> 03:21.800
You think you're funny,
don't you?

03:22.185 --> 03:25.448
- What is that?
- Oh, you mean this?

03:26.281 --> 03:28.137
Well, who's coming
for breakfast?

03:28.232 --> 03:29.769
Satan? Hitler?

03:30.152 --> 03:31.208
You love it.

03:31.304 --> 03:32.777
No, please go back

03:32.873 --> 03:34.056
to the bathroom,
shave it off.

03:34.152 --> 03:35.465
Not shaving it off.
It's authentic.

03:35.976 --> 03:37.641
- It's my hunting look.
- Oh.

03:37.737 --> 03:39.081
Yeah.

03:43.401 --> 03:44.457
- Hey, baby.
- Hmm?

03:44.905 --> 03:47.624
Authentic is how you walked
into this town.

03:48.073 --> 03:49.834
It looks good on me.

03:51.242 --> 03:52.585
It does look good.

03:53.384 --> 03:55.017
- That's right.
- It does.

03:55.112 --> 03:56.681
Now, hold on, hold on,
hold on.

03:57.801 --> 03:59.626
-Oh, wow.
-Hold on, hold on.

04:04.297 --> 04:06.057
Honey, why don't you
hop back into bed?

04:06.473 --> 04:09.097
Come on.
I'll do this authentic guy.

04:09.737 --> 04:12.073
Come on. Come on.
I mean it.

04:13.001 --> 04:14.186
Honey, come on, don't be--

04:14.282 --> 04:15.657
Making fun of me. It's fine.

04:15.754 --> 04:16.969
I mean so...

04:27.626 --> 04:29.161
All right,
let's have it.

04:30.824 --> 04:34.568
-This is irresponsible.
-You said that last night.

04:37.770 --> 04:40.329
That's just stupid,
what you're doing.

04:40.424 --> 04:42.793
-You said that too.
-Well, you're being an asshole.

04:43.561 --> 04:45.642
Tess, why are you blowing
this out of proportion?

04:46.314 --> 04:48.297
Tons of guys around here
hunt for their livelihood.

04:48.394 --> 04:50.953
Your dad does it,
Doug does it.

04:51.050 --> 04:53.865
Uh, you're not
from here, Joe.

04:54.474 --> 04:57.418
You sell insurance for a living
and you're really good at it.

04:57.513 --> 05:00.424
Okay, well,
I live here now, so what?

05:01.194 --> 05:04.458
And you're understanding of
here thus far is that mustache?

05:11.370 --> 05:13.450
You haven't hunted
enough with Doug

05:13.546 --> 05:14.920
to go out on your own.

05:15.018 --> 05:16.777
I keep telling you I have
a funny feeling about this

05:16.873 --> 05:18.409
and you just
keep ignoring that.

05:26.186 --> 05:27.626
That was mean.

05:29.802 --> 05:31.145
Yeah, it was.

05:32.842 --> 05:34.153
I'm sorry.

05:38.186 --> 05:42.442
We moved out here to provide
our boys with a safe,

05:42.538 --> 05:45.290
familiar place to grow up
and not to become some...

05:46.250 --> 05:48.363
end of the world
Fox News people.

05:48.457 --> 05:50.345
That's not
what's happening.

05:50.441 --> 05:52.042
It's not
what's happening, Tess.

05:52.138 --> 05:53.130
You have nothing to prove.

05:53.225 --> 05:54.538
I love you...

05:55.306 --> 05:56.714
without the mustache.

05:59.210 --> 06:00.426
But there are
a couple of girls

06:00.522 --> 06:02.155
I can whore you out to
if you want it.

06:02.889 --> 06:04.490
If things get worse,

06:04.587 --> 06:07.338
we need to know
how to do this stuff.

06:08.553 --> 06:09.770
Not that argument
again.

06:09.866 --> 06:11.178
No, why can't--
why can't I say that?

06:11.274 --> 06:13.194
-Why can't I say that?
-Because--

06:13.290 --> 06:14.795
Because I heard it
my whole life.

06:15.691 --> 06:16.811
Okay?

06:17.515 --> 06:19.498
I grew up with these
mountains and my--

06:19.595 --> 06:21.738
my dad prepping
for the end of days.

06:21.834 --> 06:23.723
-That's why I left.
-This is stupid.

06:23.819 --> 06:25.707
-I can't win this argument.
-Oh, you can't? You know why?

06:25.803 --> 06:27.082
Because
it's not about providing,

06:27.178 --> 06:28.363
it's about your ego,
it's about you wanting to

06:28.458 --> 06:29.899
go out with the boys
hunting.

06:30.795 --> 06:33.290
So what? So what?

06:33.387 --> 06:34.602
There's nothing
wrong with that

06:34.699 --> 06:36.043
except for experience
you don't have.

06:36.139 --> 06:38.762
-That's why I'm going out.
-With someone else, Joe.

06:38.858 --> 06:41.099
That's how you learn.
You don't learn alone.

06:41.194 --> 06:43.595
No, you learn by going
out there and doing it.

06:43.691 --> 06:45.162
Right, you just go sit
in the deer stand,

06:45.259 --> 06:46.795
you wait for a deer,
and you shoot it.

06:46.890 --> 06:48.075
Twelve-year-old boys do it.

06:48.171 --> 06:49.834
Why can't I go
out there and try it?

06:53.995 --> 06:55.978
We agreed that we would
learn together as a family.

06:56.075 --> 06:58.411
We would grow
a garden in the spring

06:58.538 --> 07:00.682
and can in the winter.

07:01.418 --> 07:03.691
Go with Doug next week.
That is all I'm asking.

07:03.787 --> 07:04.939
It's not much.

07:05.739 --> 07:09.066
I packed lunch
for the entire day.

07:09.547 --> 07:13.931
And I'm going to go out there
and I'm gonna stay all day.

07:14.027 --> 07:15.754
And I will not be home
until tonight.

07:15.851 --> 07:17.674
Okay.
And if you kill something,

07:17.771 --> 07:19.499
you know
how to disembowel it, right?

07:19.594 --> 07:22.219
Babe, I can't-- I can't.
I'm not doing this.

07:25.035 --> 07:27.243
-I love you.
-I love you.

07:27.659 --> 07:29.131
You better say
goodbye to the boys.

07:29.226 --> 07:31.499
No doubt they heard us.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.626
Love you, buddy.

07:43.723 --> 07:46.411
Hey, little lady,
hell's for breakfast.

07:49.099 --> 07:50.219
You like that?

07:50.314 --> 07:51.852
Mm-hmm.
Will you say it for me?

07:53.323 --> 07:54.571
That's why I'm coming in.

07:55.180 --> 07:57.260
To tell you I love you
and I'll see you tonight.

07:58.731 --> 07:59.980
Okay.

08:01.419 --> 08:02.794
You and Mom fighting?

08:03.372 --> 08:04.428
No, not at all.

08:05.132 --> 08:07.116
You're doing
that whisper thing again.

08:09.707 --> 08:11.596
Well,

08:11.691 --> 08:14.380
sometimes when Mom

08:14.476 --> 08:17.323
and Dads need to have
a conversation,

08:17.420 --> 08:19.596
it's better that
it happens in whispers.

08:22.924 --> 08:25.163
-You like it?
-Mm-hm.

08:27.212 --> 08:28.395
It looks funny.

08:31.116 --> 08:32.203
I love you.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.883
- I'll see you tonight.
- Me too.

08:43.147 --> 08:44.363
Hey.

08:46.987 --> 08:48.396
Last offer.

08:50.379 --> 08:51.531
Don't do this.

08:53.772 --> 08:55.212
Don't do that. Don't.

08:57.708 --> 08:59.340
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

08:59.436 --> 09:01.228
What are you doing?

09:01.325 --> 09:02.988
Okay, then.
Have fun out there.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.908
You know
what I'll be doing.

09:12.172 --> 09:14.380
What's wrong with you, Joe?

09:14.476 --> 09:18.316
Get a gun, go out,
kill a deer just to go...

10:31.692 --> 10:33.261
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

10:34.413 --> 10:35.724
Hey.

10:37.326 --> 10:38.829
Can I borrow your--
your rifle?

10:39.597 --> 10:40.909
You ain't get one yet?

10:42.605 --> 10:43.950
Tess, she, uh--

10:44.046 --> 10:45.357
she doesn't want to get
one right now.

10:45.453 --> 10:48.333
It-- it doesn't matter.
Can I just borrow yours?

11:01.388 --> 11:02.700
Ah.

11:07.597 --> 11:09.772
- Do you need ammo?
- No, I bought some.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.814
-Tess let you get ammo?
-She doesn't know I bought it.

11:12.909 --> 11:14.253
- Mmm.
- Sorry, sorry.

11:15.437 --> 11:17.965
- Got your tags?
- Got them in the bag.

11:18.061 --> 11:19.981
- You double check 'em?
- Yes, Mom.

11:20.077 --> 11:21.229
I ain't your mom.

11:21.709 --> 11:22.925
All right, I know.

11:23.469 --> 11:24.878
Won't be a problem
on the property.

11:24.973 --> 11:26.413
No one can be on it.

11:26.509 --> 11:28.397
But if an officer asks
for your tags on the way back

11:28.493 --> 11:30.638
and you don't have them,
that's trouble.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.205
I got it. Got it.

11:32.302 --> 11:33.838
You remember
how to get to the property?

11:33.934 --> 11:35.629
- I believe so.
- What else?

11:36.398 --> 11:38.414
I-- I can't think
of anything else.

11:40.973 --> 11:42.989
If you just wait
'til next week, I can go.

11:43.085 --> 11:46.061
Thank you. But I've got
two conferences next week.

11:46.157 --> 11:48.461
-Plus, Tess--
-No, I ain't in your marriage.

11:48.557 --> 11:50.509
Unless you into
some freaky stuff.

11:51.629 --> 11:53.389
Keep it to yourself, then.

11:53.998 --> 11:56.365
Look,
keys are in the car

11:56.461 --> 11:58.381
if you need to borrow it
for any reason, have at it.

11:58.478 --> 12:01.133
I ain't driving
that jerk mobile.

12:01.774 --> 12:02.734
That's nice.

12:07.118 --> 12:08.749
- Thanks again.
- Mm-hm.

12:08.845 --> 12:11.278
Hey, I'll be sure to bring
that ten point by here

12:11.374 --> 12:12.781
so you can get
that photo op.

12:12.878 --> 12:14.638
Godspeed.

12:26.989 --> 12:28.334
That's your music, right?

12:29.070 --> 12:30.669
You know,
you've got neighbors.

12:34.830 --> 12:37.358
All right, mustache.
Have fun.

26:19.830 --> 26:21.015
Strike one.

26:23.157 --> 26:24.917
One and one is the count.

26:26.166 --> 26:28.470
Joseph Chambers steps
to the mound.

26:30.773 --> 26:33.078
Bottom of the ninth.
Two outs.

26:34.455 --> 26:37.141
1991 World Series.

26:40.215 --> 26:41.526
Strike two.

26:58.070 --> 26:59.415
Too high. Too high.

27:03.350 --> 27:04.694
Ladies and gentlemen.

27:05.494 --> 27:07.318
Can Joe do it tonight?

27:08.662 --> 27:09.782
And he may.

27:11.062 --> 27:13.558
Minnesota.
The talk of the sports world.

27:21.334 --> 27:22.486
Outside.

27:39.862 --> 27:42.646
Strike three!

27:42.742 --> 27:44.566
Joseph Chambers has won

27:44.662 --> 27:47.320
the 1991 World Series.

27:47.416 --> 27:50.006
The Minnesota Twins
are victorious.

27:51.318 --> 27:54.103
Joseph Chambers is an MVP.

27:54.198 --> 27:56.214
He has just beaten
,

27:56.311 --> 27:57.880
ladies and gentlemen.

27:57.976 --> 28:00.918
There was never,
ever any doubt.

28:02.103 --> 28:04.727
We knew
he could pull it off.

28:06.552 --> 28:07.702
And tonight...

28:07.798 --> 28:11.320
We have sat here
and witnessed history.

29:13.303 --> 29:15.127
<i>♪ I'm the moustache man ♪</i>

29:15.223 --> 29:17.335
<i>♪ King of the mountain,</i>
<i>here I stand ♪</i>

29:30.648 --> 29:32.439
<i>♪ I'm the moustache man ♪</i>

29:32.535 --> 29:34.681
<i>♪ King of the mountain,</i>
<i>here I stand ♪</i>

29:44.472 --> 29:46.201

29:46.297 --> 29:48.632
<i>♪ King of the woods,</i>
<i>yeah, here I stand ♪</i>

29:48.728 --> 29:50.423
<i>♪ I'm the moustache man ♪</i>

29:50.519 --> 29:53.081
<i>♪ I'll catch it,</i>
<i>I'll kill it any way I can ♪</i>

34:47.547 --> 34:51.130
No, no, no.

36:51.548 --> 36:53.564
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36:53.660 --> 36:55.771
Oh, no, please no.

36:56.988 --> 37:00.764
Oh, please just wake up.

37:08.123 --> 37:11.164
Oh, please tell me
this isn't happening.

37:14.811 --> 37:18.236
Oh, oh, oh.

37:28.251 --> 37:31.227
I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

37:33.500 --> 37:34.748
Oh, please, God.

37:34.845 --> 37:37.883
Please, please, please,
please, please, oh, please.

37:37.979 --> 37:39.548
Please, I'm so sorry.

39:32.381 --> 39:35.998
Stupid fucking vest.

42:47.455 --> 42:48.959
He's trespassing.

42:50.911 --> 42:52.479
And I'm just standing
my ground, right?

42:53.119 --> 42:54.528
I'm supposed to be
on this property.

42:54.624 --> 42:56.031
He's not supposed to be
on this property.

42:59.135 --> 43:00.479
So...

43:01.216 --> 43:02.495
I did a good thing.

43:02.591 --> 43:04.607
Maybe some little kid
had been on here, right?

43:04.703 --> 43:06.049
What if this guy
was dangerous?

43:06.559 --> 43:08.127
They should thank me
for getting his ass

43:08.223 --> 43:09.920
off of this property
because he was trespassing.

43:10.015 --> 43:12.639
He could be a convict,
he could be dangerous.

43:13.120 --> 43:14.623
He's breaking the law,

43:14.720 --> 43:15.935
and no, it's not my job

43:16.031 --> 43:17.759
to enforce the law
by any means.

43:17.855 --> 43:19.167
I'm not saying that.

43:19.263 --> 43:20.959
What I am saying, though,
is that he is the danger.

43:21.056 --> 43:23.487
And I will just have to
stand my ground.

43:26.656 --> 43:29.567
All right.
Exactly what I'm doing.

43:33.025 --> 43:34.336
Make this go away.

43:53.503 --> 43:55.136
It was an accident.

43:56.127 --> 43:57.728
Of course it's an accident,
you idiot.

43:58.240 --> 43:59.905
You didn't do this
on purpose.

44:00.319 --> 44:04.159
Come on, Joe.
These things happen, okay?

44:05.792 --> 44:07.199
He was on private property.

44:08.064 --> 44:09.888
Private land means
trespassing,

44:09.984 --> 44:12.032
and trespassing means
stand your ground.

44:14.719 --> 44:17.216
You're doing
what's right, okay?

44:17.312 --> 44:18.528
You did
the right thing, Joe.

44:20.448 --> 44:23.200
Okay, okay.

44:24.160 --> 44:26.625
Okay, it's the right thing.

44:27.264 --> 44:31.168
You gotta dig a hole.
You gotta put him in it.

44:32.608 --> 44:33.600
Dig a hole.

44:34.112 --> 44:36.512
And you gotta put him in it,
do you hear me, Joe?

44:37.121 --> 44:38.368
Go and dig a hole.

44:38.463 --> 44:41.280
You put him in it.
You gonna dig a hole.

44:47.072 --> 44:48.288
I'm so sorry.

45:10.528 --> 45:13.601
Go and dig a hole.
You put him in it.

45:14.112 --> 45:16.961
Dig a hole.
You gotta put him in it.

45:17.505 --> 45:18.881
Go dig a hole.

45:20.417 --> 45:22.848
Dig a hole
and put him in it.

45:22.944 --> 45:25.153
Dig a hole
and put him in it.

45:25.250 --> 45:27.521
Dig a hole,
put him in it.

45:27.617 --> 45:29.986
Dig a hole,
put him in it.

45:30.401 --> 45:32.096
Dig a hole,
put him in it.

45:32.192 --> 45:33.793
Dig a hole.

45:33.890 --> 45:36.224
Dig a hole.

45:45.410 --> 45:47.457
Dig a hole
and put him in it.

45:47.552 --> 45:50.497
Dig a hole,
put him in it.

45:51.553 --> 45:55.168
Just dig a hole
and put him in it.

46:48.514 --> 46:49.857
No, no, wait.

46:50.273 --> 46:52.289
Wait. Wait, please.
Please don't run away.

46:52.386 --> 46:53.889
- Help.
- Please don't run away.

46:53.985 --> 46:55.905
- Help! Someone!
- Hey! Sir! Sir.

46:56.001 --> 46:57.506
No. No, no.
Please wait. Come back.

46:57.601 --> 46:58.753
- Somebody help.
- No, no.

46:58.849 --> 47:00.354
I'm not gonna hurt you,
I promise.

47:00.481 --> 47:01.505
- Help! Help!
- No, no, Wait. Wait.

47:01.602 --> 47:03.010
- Hold on.
- Help!

47:03.106 --> 47:04.449
- Please stop running!
- Somebody! Help!

47:04.545 --> 47:06.625
No, no, no.
Please stop running.

47:06.721 --> 47:09.185
- Sir, hold on. Hold on.
- Help! Help!

47:09.282 --> 47:10.722
No, no, no,
please, please, please.

47:10.818 --> 47:12.162
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Help!

47:12.258 --> 47:13.506
No, no,
I'm not gonna hurt you, please.

47:13.602 --> 47:15.362
- Help!
- Hey! Hey!

47:15.458 --> 47:16.769
Stop, please, please!

47:19.491 --> 47:21.282
No! No, no, ow!

47:23.745 --> 47:24.898
Please stop!

47:24.995 --> 47:27.553
Please stop, please stop.
Stop it, please.

47:27.649 --> 47:29.282
I wanna help you, okay? Ow!

47:29.378 --> 47:31.938
Please! Let me talk.

47:32.034 --> 47:33.891
No, no. Ow!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

47:33.987 --> 47:35.651
No! Hold on.
Just let me explain. Ow!

47:36.225 --> 47:37.571
Stop and let me explain.

47:37.667 --> 47:39.491
Ah! No! Stop it!

47:40.098 --> 47:41.603
God, please. Please stop!

47:41.697 --> 47:43.074
- Help!
- Please stop!

47:43.170 --> 47:44.994
- Listen. Listen. Listen.
- Help! Help!

47:45.443 --> 47:47.585
- Help! Help!
- I'm not gonna hurt you!

47:47.682 --> 47:48.770
I promise
I'm not gonna hurt you.

47:48.865 --> 47:50.147
I promise
I'm not gonna hurt you.

47:50.243 --> 47:51.329
I promise
I'm not gonna hurt you.

47:51.425 --> 47:52.705
I promise
I'm not gonna hurt you.

47:52.802 --> 47:55.298
- Please. Please. Please.
- Help!

47:55.394 --> 47:58.114
- Please, please, ow!
- Somebody!

47:58.209 --> 48:00.898
Please stop! Please stop!

48:00.994 --> 48:04.451
Please stop. Please stop.
Please, please, please.

48:04.929 --> 48:07.106
Okay. Okay. Okay.

48:17.282 --> 48:19.971
Help, please, someone.

48:20.067 --> 48:22.082
Help me.

48:25.218 --> 48:27.523
Somebody!

48:28.898 --> 48:30.690
Help.

48:47.330 --> 48:49.731
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

48:49.827 --> 48:51.491
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

48:51.587 --> 48:53.794
No, I'm not gonna--
Hold on. Let me help you.

48:53.890 --> 48:55.010
I'm just gonna
help you sit up.

48:55.107 --> 48:57.347
Okay? Come on.

48:57.443 --> 48:58.594
Come on. I'm sorry.

48:58.690 --> 49:01.506
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

49:01.603 --> 49:05.539
I'm sorry. Stop.
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

49:05.987 --> 49:07.620
Okay?
I'm just trying to help.

49:07.716 --> 49:09.122
You shot me.

49:11.330 --> 49:12.898
You're on private property.

49:13.828 --> 49:14.850
You were trespassing.

49:19.236 --> 49:20.866
Private property...

49:50.212 --> 49:51.426
How old are you?

49:59.619 --> 50:00.644
Do you live out here?

50:05.540 --> 50:07.043
I was trying to.

50:15.108 --> 50:16.323
Are you out here alone?

50:19.748 --> 50:21.059
What the fuck?

50:21.892 --> 50:23.363
What the fuck
were you thinking?

50:24.291 --> 50:26.468
Firing off
in the woods like that.

50:28.324 --> 50:29.380
I was chasing a deer.

50:30.564 --> 50:31.907
I didn't mean
to shoot you.

50:34.499 --> 50:36.868
It's my buddy's property.

50:38.563 --> 50:40.004
He lets me
come out here and hunt.

50:40.483 --> 50:41.828
I was following this deer.

50:44.131 --> 50:45.315
Trying to learn
how to be self-reliant

50:45.412 --> 50:46.979
in case things get worse,
you know?

50:56.324 --> 50:57.892
Ah, you're an idiot.

51:02.276 --> 51:04.004
You don't belong out here.

51:10.147 --> 51:11.909
Your type will be
the first to go

51:12.004 --> 51:13.316
when it goes down.

51:17.924 --> 51:19.684
I'm trying, okay?

51:19.780 --> 51:21.316
That's why
I was trying to kill a deer,

51:21.413 --> 51:22.691
so I could clean it.

51:22.787 --> 51:24.997
And I could keep it
in my freezer,

51:25.093 --> 51:26.531
and I can feed my family.

51:27.940 --> 51:28.964
So, I'm trying.

51:32.517 --> 51:34.724
What kind of working freezer
are you gonna put it in

51:34.820 --> 51:36.067
when there's no power?

51:39.780 --> 51:40.996
What?

51:43.141 --> 51:46.948
Does your freezer
magically work in your fantasy?

51:52.708 --> 51:53.733
I guess so.

51:57.541 --> 51:59.171
Small animals...

52:02.533 --> 52:03.844
how you survive.

52:10.053 --> 52:11.077
And wheat.

52:16.229 --> 52:19.267
Edible plants...

52:20.132 --> 52:22.309
You just waste resources
with deer.

52:31.525 --> 52:32.740
I didn't know that.

52:34.469 --> 52:36.037
My buddy, Doug,
has been teaching me how--

52:41.093 --> 52:42.565
Come on.
We got to do something.

52:42.661 --> 52:44.325
- No. Don't.
- Yeah, let me just--

52:44.421 --> 52:45.701
-let's just try, let's just--
-Don't.

52:46.629 --> 52:48.357
Don't--

52:48.453 --> 52:49.765
don't try.

52:49.860 --> 52:51.654
I'm at least gonna try
to stop the bleeding.

52:51.749 --> 52:53.796
You're a fucking idiot.

52:54.629 --> 52:56.069
No, stop. Don't touch me.

52:56.676 --> 52:58.596
Don't come--
don't touch me.

52:58.692 --> 53:01.606
Stop!
Goddammit, stop it!

53:01.701 --> 53:04.645
Just let me help.
Here. Here. Here.

53:04.742 --> 53:06.212
It's not gonna make any--

53:06.308 --> 53:07.366
Stop.
I'll just put this back here.

53:07.462 --> 53:08.934
Don't-- don't try-- Stop.

53:09.030 --> 53:10.469
Stop it.

53:10.565 --> 53:12.100
Just lean up. Lean up.

53:12.197 --> 53:13.637
Oh, God!

53:14.948 --> 53:16.325
Goddammit, stop.

53:19.173 --> 53:21.285
- I'm so sorry.
- Stop saying that.

53:21.381 --> 53:22.596
I'm so sorry.

53:23.045 --> 53:24.933
God damn you're pathetic...

53:52.166 --> 53:53.317
I need to get you
to the hospital.

53:53.413 --> 53:54.886
No, you don't.

53:54.981 --> 53:56.101
Look,
I was only digging the hole

53:56.197 --> 53:57.734
'cause I thought
you was dead, okay?

53:57.830 --> 53:59.494
Now that-- if I'd known that
you were alive, I would've--

53:59.590 --> 54:02.149
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

54:06.918 --> 54:08.357
I can't just
leave you out here.

54:08.454 --> 54:10.150
We got to try to get you down
to the truck, come on.

54:10.246 --> 54:12.326
-Man, come on, just--
-If you keep touching me

54:12.421 --> 54:15.685
I'm gonna kill you.

54:20.006 --> 54:21.222
I'm so sorry.

54:22.950 --> 54:24.454
Stop saying that.

54:24.933 --> 54:26.470
Stop saying that.

54:29.733 --> 54:32.006
God, it's pathetic.

54:32.742 --> 54:34.150
You're not gonna
fix anything.

55:12.967 --> 55:14.343
How long
you been living out here?

55:18.661 --> 55:19.878
Doesn't matter.

55:21.638 --> 55:23.654
Seems like you've been
out here for a long time.

55:24.391 --> 55:25.830
Is there somebody
I can call for you?

56:05.702 --> 56:06.919
Yeah.

56:09.959 --> 56:13.095
You pick out them fancy
catalogue clothes yourself?

56:14.151 --> 56:15.623
Or your mommy do it for you?

56:20.391 --> 56:21.479
Oh, God.

56:22.599 --> 56:25.447
Oh, the irony.

56:29.639 --> 56:30.919
Killed by a phony.

56:38.151 --> 56:39.367
Yup.

56:41.127 --> 56:42.343
I'm a big phony.

56:43.399 --> 56:44.615
But I'm at least trying.

56:46.055 --> 56:47.335
That was the whole
point of this.

56:56.135 --> 56:59.143
Oh, God.

57:13.224 --> 57:15.879
I can't just sit here
while you're dying,

57:15.975 --> 57:17.320
so no,
we need to do something.

57:17.416 --> 57:18.951
Just shut up.

57:53.736 --> 57:55.783
My wife didn't want me
to come out here today.

58:00.136 --> 58:02.280
She tried everything
to keep me to stay at home.

58:03.080 --> 58:04.392
I'm just saying,
it seems like

58:04.488 --> 58:06.087
the whole world
is falling apart and it's--

58:28.328 --> 58:29.736
There is no...

58:32.232 --> 58:33.832
...point to surviving.

58:36.424 --> 58:37.672
Just to survive.

58:42.665 --> 58:43.848
There's no point.

59:08.360 --> 59:09.576
Well...

59:15.625 --> 59:16.969
the whole point
of this was...

59:17.736 --> 59:19.112
so I could take care of
my family.

59:22.921 --> 59:24.361
If things got really bad,
I don't--

59:25.225 --> 59:27.369
I don't know how to do anything
but sell insurance.

59:29.864 --> 59:30.888
I just want to--

59:32.840 --> 59:35.241
I just want to be able
to take care of them, you know?

59:41.161 --> 59:43.177
I'm so sorry.
I did not mean--

01:00:27.497 --> 01:00:28.745
I'm so sorry.

01:00:29.865 --> 01:00:31.145
I'm so sorry.

01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:37.705
Okay.

01:00:38.857 --> 01:00:39.913
Okay.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:45.711
Joe. Joe.

01:09:48.879 --> 01:09:50.126
Hey, sexy.

01:10:04.559 --> 01:10:06.094
Hey, sweetheart.

01:10:07.951 --> 01:10:09.423
Is this your new hunting look,

01:10:09.519 --> 01:10:10.799
or you're just trying
to make me regret

01:10:10.895 --> 01:10:13.486
being so mean to you
this morning?

01:10:17.487 --> 01:10:21.807
I, uh, fell in the river
and decided to strip down

01:10:21.903 --> 01:10:23.375
and ride home with the heat on.

01:10:24.815 --> 01:10:27.312
I'm sorry,
I'll take you any way I can.

01:10:30.863 --> 01:10:32.335
Did you see anything?

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:34.510
No.

01:10:36.143 --> 01:10:39.406
-Did you have fun, at least?
-Yeah. It was okay.

01:10:41.871 --> 01:10:42.927
Hey, what's wrong?

01:10:45.615 --> 01:10:46.671
Nothing.

01:10:47.151 --> 01:10:50.959
Just tired and sore
from walking around all day.

01:10:51.695 --> 01:10:53.135
Yeah, that can happen.

01:11:30.991 --> 01:11:32.368
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:11:33.167 --> 01:11:35.022
<i>The irony...</i>

01:11:40.335 --> 01:11:41.680
<i>Killed by a phony...</i>

01:11:42.544 --> 01:11:45.744
Does Doug know you're
keeping the truck overnight?

01:11:47.184 --> 01:11:48.719
No, he, uh...

01:11:49.904 --> 01:11:51.280
I figured I'd come home,
eat dinner,

01:11:51.376 --> 01:11:52.720
maybe drop it by later.

01:11:52.816 --> 01:11:54.544
Just didn't want
to show up in my underwear.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.488
-Never live that down.
-That's true.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:01.871
-Watch out.
-Sorry.

01:12:10.352 --> 01:12:12.208
<i>Hey, sexy.</i>

01:12:14.736 --> 01:12:15.856
Hey...

01:12:17.936 --> 01:12:19.152
You okay?

01:12:19.984 --> 01:12:21.488
Sure. I'm fine.

01:12:21.968 --> 01:12:23.440
Just need some food in me.

01:12:25.488 --> 01:12:27.568
Thank you, Father,
thank you, Father,

01:12:27.665 --> 01:12:29.040
for this wonderful food.

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:30.800
Thank you, Father, for Dad
being able to go hunting

01:12:30.896 --> 01:12:32.784
and come back safely,

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.544
in Jesus' name, amen.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:36.528
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.832
Well, we didn't get a deer,

01:12:42.928 --> 01:12:47.088
but we did get Daddy's
favorite meat as back up.

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:48.720
Ribs.

01:12:49.648 --> 01:12:52.688
I was actually,
talking to Frank about venison,

01:12:52.784 --> 01:12:53.968
about the different ways

01:12:54.064 --> 01:12:55.632
you can cut it
and cook it,

01:12:55.728 --> 01:12:58.512
and he said that if
you happen to catch a deer,

01:12:58.608 --> 01:13:00.624
you should have him
do it this time...

01:13:11.313 --> 01:13:13.040
<i>No, help me!</i>

01:13:13.137 --> 01:13:14.832
<i>Please!</i>

01:13:20.784 --> 01:13:22.033
<i>Joe.</i>

01:15:03.122 --> 01:15:05.617
Okay, okay, okay.

01:21:18.261 --> 01:21:20.310
He says,
"Pat, well, that's exactly

01:21:20.406 --> 01:21:21.781
what I said, and Pat--"

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:24.277
He just kind of
walks up and says,

01:21:24.373 --> 01:21:28.597
"No, ma'am,
you said armadillo."

01:21:32.822 --> 01:21:34.293
Hey, Joey.

01:21:38.613 --> 01:21:40.917
Joe? Hey, are you all right?

01:21:43.317 --> 01:21:45.206
Hey, Bonnie, I'm gonna have to
call you back.

01:21:53.237 --> 01:21:54.774
Hey, buddy, what's going on?

01:21:58.197 --> 01:22:00.053
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

01:22:01.044 --> 01:22:02.326
Can you talk to me?

01:22:05.686 --> 01:22:07.829
Joe, I'm just gonna have
a quick look at you.

01:22:15.126 --> 01:22:16.629
I'm gonna grab you a blanket.

01:22:17.269 --> 01:22:18.934
Just wait-- wait right here.

01:22:40.214 --> 01:22:41.750
Tessie and the kids?

01:22:44.373 --> 01:22:47.285
Joe. Are they hurt?

01:22:49.366 --> 01:22:51.797
Okay, all right,
look, I'm just gonna

01:22:51.893 --> 01:22:53.813
put this blanket on,
I'll get you--

01:22:54.454 --> 01:22:56.055
get youreal-- what?

01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:02.966
Okay, all right,
you stay right here.

01:23:03.542 --> 01:23:04.855
I'll be right back.

01:23:29.782 --> 01:23:30.807
Oh!

01:23:32.054 --> 01:23:33.270
Dammit.

01:23:42.327 --> 01:23:46.582
We have a situation,
1089, white pickup truck

01:23:46.678 --> 01:23:48.598
at the police station
parked right in front.

01:23:48.694 --> 01:23:49.975
You can't miss it.

01:23:51.799 --> 01:23:53.783
I'm going to need
one of you to come back here.

01:23:57.015 --> 01:23:58.198
All right, do me a favor,

01:23:58.294 --> 01:24:00.022
set up a perimeter
when you arrive

01:24:00.118 --> 01:24:02.519
I'll be inside
questioning the suspect.

01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:06.870
God damn it.

01:24:21.206 --> 01:24:22.967
I have to cuff you, Joe.

01:24:25.591 --> 01:24:28.087
Just 'till we figure out
what's going on, all right?

01:24:30.327 --> 01:24:31.798
All right,
we're gonna go in the back,

01:24:31.895 --> 01:24:33.271
and have a little chat.

01:24:35.704 --> 01:24:37.815
Just step against the wall
to the right.

01:24:48.311 --> 01:24:50.360
All right we're gonna go
right to the right here.

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.750
All right, I'm gonna
have you sit...

01:25:00.119 --> 01:25:01.463
Just sit right here.

01:25:06.294 --> 01:25:08.376
Oh, the motion sensors
are on the fritz.

01:25:08.471 --> 01:25:12.023
So, I'm gonna wave my arm
around like a jackass.

01:25:19.670 --> 01:25:20.920
All right, Joe...

01:25:22.679 --> 01:25:24.503
do you think
you can tell me what happened?

01:25:37.943 --> 01:25:40.248
Joe, there's a body
in the back of Doug's truck.

01:25:47.479 --> 01:25:48.792
Joe.

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:54.326
Can you-- can you tell me
how it got there?

01:26:12.152 --> 01:26:16.279
Listen Joe,
I am here for you, all right?

01:26:16.375 --> 01:26:19.064
But you have to tell me
what happened.

01:26:38.488 --> 01:26:39.768
Come on, Joe.

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:47.577
I just want to see Tess.

01:26:48.984 --> 01:26:50.201
yeah.

01:26:51.096 --> 01:26:52.888
We can work that out.

01:26:54.008 --> 01:26:55.032
Say it.

01:26:55.801 --> 01:26:58.008
- I just want to see the boys.
- Okay.

01:26:59.224 --> 01:27:00.313
I can help you.

01:27:00.953 --> 01:27:04.441
But you-- you still have to
tell me what's going on.

01:27:07.608 --> 01:27:09.528
I need you to tell me
what happened.

01:27:13.911 --> 01:27:16.985
Take your time,
there's no rush.

01:27:19.001 --> 01:27:20.600
There's no rush, Joe.

01:27:21.496 --> 01:27:22.712
There's no rush, huh?

01:27:22.808 --> 01:27:26.136
I am here,
so whenever you're ready...
