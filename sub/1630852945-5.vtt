He wasn't here today.

13:57.621 --> 14:00.388

14:00.490 --> 14:02.190
Sick? Ah.

14:02.292 --> 14:03.791
<i> Qué cagado.</i>

14:03.894 --> 14:05.059
You sure?

14:05.161 --> 14:06.327
Look, man, let's just
find this phone.

14:06.429 --> 14:07.862
All right?

14:07.964 --> 14:11.633
Cissy:
I appreciate y'all taking
the time to talk with us.

14:11.735 --> 14:15.270
Veronique:
Franklin, he felt badly
about how things went.

14:15.372 --> 14:17.438
He had to meet with teddy,
otherwise he would've been here.

14:17.541 --> 14:19.340
I don't need you
to apologize for him.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.175
And I also don't need
to be out here,

14:21.278 --> 14:23.645

twice, sweating my edges out.

14:23.747 --> 14:26.214
It's not the same conversation,
louie.

14:26.316 --> 14:30.184

you to work with franklin.

in this drug game.

15:22.305 --> 15:24.038
Y'all know that.

15:25.008 --> 15:28.743
Real estate isn't just
a path to legitimacy.

15:29.779 --> 15:31.212
It's a path to a life
where you don't have to...

15:31.314 --> 15:32.614
-(pager beeping)
-...Live in fear,

15:32.716 --> 15:34.515
wondering when
the ground is gonna drop

15:34.618 --> 15:36.184
from beneath your feet.

15:37.887 --> 15:42.190
I don't need you to invest
with franklin.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.461
I'm just asking you
to think of an end.

15:46.563 --> 15:48.162
Make some plans.

15:48.264 --> 15:50.598
(pager beeping)

15:50.700 --> 15:52.567

Hey. I'll be right back.

16:11.254 --> 16:13.287

was totally into it.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.922
Yeah, she had her tits hyped up
and everything.

16:15.025 --> 16:17.125
How much longer
are you gonna need?

16:17.227 --> 16:19.427
Oh, it's a guaranteed
blockbuster.

16:19.529 --> 16:21.062
Nigga, that old piece of paper

16:32.842 --> 16:35.309
Y'all niggas need to put
your minds right.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.679
Find ways to use white laws
against white people

16:37.781 --> 16:39.681
whenever it's strategically
advantageous.

16:39.783 --> 16:41.516
-Strategically advantageous,

-Yeah.

16:41.618 --> 16:43.184
