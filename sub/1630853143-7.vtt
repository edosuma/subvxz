00:22.063 --> 00:24.065
[uptempo classical tune playing]

00:34.659 --> 00:35.535
[gunshot]

00:49.507 --> 00:50.884
[uptempo tune continues]

00:54.012 --> 00:55.305
Pull!

01:27.045 --> 01:28.421
[tempo slows]

01:33.718 --> 01:35.095
[pigeon coos]

01:36.429 --> 01:37.639
[tempo increases]

01:42.560 --> 01:44.312
[piano music intensifies]

01:52.028 --> 01:53.113
[neck cracks]

01:55.532 --> 01:56.991
[crows cawing]

01:57.784 --> 01:58.993
[breathes heavily]

02:00.995 --> 02:02.330
[chews loudly]

02:08.545 --> 02:09.379
[inhales sharply]

02:09.462 --> 02:11.089
Would you please ask Miss Nolan

02:11.172 --> 02:13.508
if my personal effects
have yet been removed

02:13.591 --> 02:16.970
from the duke's bedchamber
and placed in the duchess's rooms?

02:17.053 --> 02:20.974
Would you please inform Her Grace
that I will allow no such thing?

02:23.226 --> 02:25.770
Should I really deliver the message,
Your Grace?

02:25.854 --> 02:29.065
You cannot believe
I shall welcome you back into my bed

02:29.149 --> 02:30.692
after your lies and deception?

02:30.775 --> 02:31.734
[Simon] Rest assured,

02:31.818 --> 02:33.903
marital relations
are the least of my concern

02:33.987 --> 02:35.238
after your recent efforts.

02:35.321 --> 02:38.074
Then for what other purpose
could you possibly wish to detain me?

02:38.158 --> 02:39.784
[slams chalice] Because you are my wife.

02:40.869 --> 02:41.870
[Daphne slams chalice]

02:43.872 --> 02:46.541
It is customary for a wife
to reside in her own bedchamber

02:46.624 --> 02:47.876
once the honeymoon is over…

02:49.335 --> 02:51.921
a time that has well and truly passed,
would you not agree?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.882
I will be kept informed

02:54.716 --> 02:57.760
as to the success
of your conjugal endeavors.

02:57.844 --> 03:01.472
I would never dream of concealing
the truth of such important matters.

03:01.556 --> 03:04.809
-[door opens]
-Your Grace, Whistledown has just arrived.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.229
-Well, you should…
-Is something wrong?

03:08.813 --> 03:11.316
-We must pack straightaway.
-Yes, Your Grace.

03:11.816 --> 03:12.901
What has happened?

03:14.110 --> 03:16.779
My brother seems
to have been embroiled in scandal.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.364
I must return to my family immediately.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.408
-They will need me.
-I will accompany you.

03:20.491 --> 03:21.951
This is a family matter.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.288
Separate bedrooms may be tolerated.
Separate households will not be suffered.

03:26.247 --> 03:29.417
I'll not let you out of my sight
until we know whether you are with child.

03:29.918 --> 03:30.960
[scoffing chuckle]

03:32.253 --> 03:35.673
Please request that His Grace
prepare his largest carriage.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.343
I shall require my space.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.347
[door closes]

03:44.599 --> 03:46.601
[intense music playing]

03:52.357 --> 03:54.317
[overlapping chatter]

03:54.400 --> 03:57.570
[Lady Whistledown] Miss Marina Thompson's
recent fall from grace

03:57.654 --> 04:01.824
continues to echo
through every drawing room in town,

04:01.908 --> 04:04.327
days after it was revealed

04:04.410 --> 04:09.040
her engagement to Colin Bridgerton
was nothing more than a sham.

04:16.172 --> 04:20.802
Of course, a lady's disgrace
does not merely tarnish her own name.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.471
Like the tars of the Thames,

04:23.554 --> 04:27.892
it also leaves a horrid smear
on anyone nearby.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.144
Hold still, ma chérie.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.692
This scandal could very well
tarnish my debut, Mama.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.236
Perhaps we should delay my coming out
altogether a few years.

04:38.319 --> 04:41.072
Hush, child, all will be well.
Just keep smiling.

04:41.155 --> 04:43.491
[Eloise] Can a smile be enough
to save the Featheringtons?

04:43.574 --> 04:44.993
Penelope and her sisters
did nothing wrong,

04:45.076 --> 04:46.577
but their reputation's destroyed.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.414
You should be worrying about
your own family's fortunes at present.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.708
We are in just as perilous position.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.127
Lovely day, is it not, Lady Richmond?

04:57.088 --> 04:58.214
It's this Whistledown.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.550
I certainly never want to cross the woman.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.552
Her word as good as gospel.

05:02.635 --> 05:03.469
Yes.

05:04.595 --> 05:07.140
Though, perhaps
if she can destroy a reputation…

05:08.808 --> 05:10.226
she can restore one too.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.981
[gasps theatrically]
Très élégante, Miss Bridgerton.

05:15.064 --> 05:17.191
What a debutante you will be!

05:17.275 --> 05:18.109
[chuckles]

05:18.192 --> 05:20.653
[Lady Whistledown]
While there is no parasol in the world

05:20.737 --> 05:23.614
strong enough to shelter a ruined woman,

05:23.698 --> 05:27.160
the fallen Miss Thompson can only hope
she shall find a refuge…

05:27.994 --> 05:29.120
somewhere.

05:29.203 --> 05:32.707
-I am sorry, my lady, but we are full.
-This is an emergency.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.376
The young lady's child
will have nowhere else to go.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.795
You must make exceptions on occasion?

05:37.879 --> 05:39.630
I should be able to procure a room

05:39.714 --> 05:41.716
if one were to make a sizable donation.

05:41.799 --> 05:44.886
[Featherington] But this is supposed to be
a charitable organization.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.554
[nurse] Even charity requires funds,

05:46.637 --> 05:49.682
of which you must have
considerable amounts, I presume?

05:49.766 --> 05:51.851
I… [sighs]

06:02.904 --> 06:05.406
-[horse neighs]
-[driver] Whoa there, boy. Whoa there!

06:09.202 --> 06:10.244
We have arrived.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.086
There is no need to act the jailer.

06:18.169 --> 06:21.964
I shall not discover I am with child
within the next hour, shall I?

06:25.385 --> 06:28.388
Miss Thompson must be in agonies
over these lies. Why can I not visit her?

06:28.471 --> 06:30.014
-Colin--
-[Anthony] Listen to me.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.517
That the ton devours
every bit of Whistledown's on-dit

06:32.600 --> 06:34.477
is the only thing
keeping this family from shame.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.895
Because of her, no one believes

06:35.978 --> 06:37.939
you are the father
of Miss Thompson's child.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.440
But if you were to go near her,

06:39.524 --> 06:41.359
they'll presume you responsible
for her ruin,

06:41.442 --> 06:43.528
and your sisters
will pay the price for your notoriety.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.571
-Is this what you desire?
-Of course not, but--

06:46.656 --> 06:47.949
-Evening, everyone.
-Dearest!

06:48.032 --> 06:50.201
What are you doing here?
Should you not be frolicking

06:50.284 --> 06:51.244
in newlywed bliss?

06:51.327 --> 06:53.996
I came as swiftly as our carriage
would allow when I heard the news.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.373
In the middle of your honeymoon?

06:55.456 --> 06:58.084
Hastings must surely be cursing
the Bridgerton name for this.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.460
Where is he, anyhow?

06:59.544 --> 07:01.295
He went to set up Hastings House.

07:01.379 --> 07:05.049
We have all things in order, Sister.
We do not require your assistance.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.926
That is simply not true, and you know it.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.178
Daphne may be
the answer to all of our problems.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.056
Once the ton see that we still have
the favor of the duke and duchess,

07:12.140 --> 07:14.475
then the whispers may very well cease,

07:14.559 --> 07:17.854
and we shall go about our daily lives
as if nothing has happened,

07:17.937 --> 07:18.938
as if nothing is awry.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.398
And no one will be the wiser.

07:22.191 --> 07:25.236
Pretending that nothing is amiss
is the perfect way

07:25.319 --> 07:27.196
to lure the ignorant into submission.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.157
Is it not, Mama?

07:32.452 --> 07:35.997
Now, what grand event
will the ton be descending upon this week?

07:36.080 --> 07:37.582
Surely there is something?

07:38.082 --> 07:39.292
[clears throat] The, um…

07:40.168 --> 07:41.794
The queen is hosting a luncheon.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.464
I am certain
the duke and I can secure an invitation.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.506
If we are lucky,

07:45.590 --> 07:49.260
our return to London will give everyone
so much to talk about,

07:49.343 --> 07:51.846
they simply have no breath left
to discuss other matters.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.140
I'm so very glad
this has all been settled on my behalf.

07:56.392 --> 07:57.435
[door slams]

07:58.728 --> 08:00.271
-[knocking on door]
-[door opens]

08:07.904 --> 08:10.323
[Daphne] You really wanted to marry her?

08:10.406 --> 08:11.324
I did.

08:11.407 --> 08:14.577
Well, then,
perhaps we should count you lucky

08:15.077 --> 08:16.621
to not have married a stranger.

08:16.704 --> 08:19.624
-She was not a stranger.
-She was, Brother.

08:19.707 --> 08:22.793
-Whistledown knew her better than you.
-Whistledown knows everyone's secrets.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.837
You're lucky
to have learned Miss Thompson's now,

08:24.921 --> 08:26.297
instead of after your wedding day.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.513
I know you must think me a fool…

08:35.181 --> 08:37.475
but my heart pays no heed to mere logic.

08:38.059 --> 08:38.976
When I think of her,

08:39.060 --> 08:41.896
I only want to be near her,
to be with her…

08:42.647 --> 08:44.440
despite all reason otherwise.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.069
I know that madness well…

08:49.987 --> 08:51.405
but you cannot visit her.

08:57.453 --> 09:01.832
Leander swam Abydos to Sestos
every single night in complete darkness

09:01.916 --> 09:03.125
just to see his love.

09:03.209 --> 09:06.087
Leander also lost his way and drowned.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.424
So the story goes.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.470
Did something happen, Sister,

09:14.554 --> 09:15.596
back at Clyvedon?

09:19.016 --> 09:20.142
[inhales sharply]

09:20.226 --> 09:22.478
If you really must speak
with Miss Thompson,

09:22.562 --> 09:24.230
perhaps I can arrange a rendezvous.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.857
Chaperoned, obviously.

09:26.941 --> 09:30.528
I would appreciate that.
You will see my passions are not in vain.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.784
[both grunting, groaning]

09:40.413 --> 09:42.415
Always were a fast learner, friend.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.459
But I should probably conserve my energies
for my exhibitions,

09:45.543 --> 09:47.420
instead of spending them on your troubles.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.213
Are you about to cede to me?

09:49.297 --> 09:51.591
Surely that will not help
with your exhibitions?

09:52.717 --> 09:54.135
I've not seen you this incensed

09:54.218 --> 09:56.596
since you were handed the keys
to your dukedom.

09:57.096 --> 10:00.266
-I will not speak of my dukedom.
-[chuckles] Fair enough.

10:00.349 --> 10:03.185
I presume you won't speak of what happened
on your honeymoon, either.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.605
Nothing happened on my honeymoon.

10:06.647 --> 10:09.525
I cannot imagine your wife feeling
particularly excited about that.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.945
I suggest you do not try to imagine
anything to do with my wife's feelings…

10:13.029 --> 10:14.864
or actions, for that matter. [grunts]

10:15.364 --> 10:16.782
[both panting]

10:17.617 --> 10:20.119
It follows no reason or sense, does it?

10:20.202 --> 10:21.495
-What?
-Marriage.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.832
And there is not a bloody thing
you can do about it.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.543
-I took a vow.
-Ah.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.420
See what I mean?

10:30.046 --> 10:31.964
Fast learner, indeed.

10:33.507 --> 10:34.467
[sighs sharply]

10:38.971 --> 10:41.140
[sighs]

10:44.435 --> 10:45.728
[sighs deeply]

10:45.811 --> 10:47.396
[footsteps approaching]

10:48.064 --> 10:49.065
[gasps sharply]

11:01.118 --> 11:02.578
[Simon] You are still awake?

11:05.414 --> 11:06.916
I have already seen you.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.173
The queen is holding a luncheon this week.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.260
We will need to attend with my brother
to signal our support.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.306
Where have you been all night?

11:22.390 --> 11:25.059
I did not think you concerned
about my whereabouts.

11:25.142 --> 11:28.354
Is this truly
what our marriage will be for the future?

11:29.313 --> 11:32.149
You out all night, doing God knows what
with God knows whom?

11:32.233 --> 11:33.150
"With whom?"

11:33.776 --> 11:34.735
You wound me.

11:35.236 --> 11:38.406
Not three weeks since we were wed,
yet already you imagine me disloyal.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.658
Is it such a wild imagining?

11:41.450 --> 11:43.577
We both know your reputation, Your Grace.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.205
It is clear that you find
there is nothing left in our marriage.

11:46.288 --> 11:47.581
Nothing left?

11:48.290 --> 11:49.375
It is what I said.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.087
Is it what you believe?

12:05.141 --> 12:06.183
[Daphne moans]

12:13.983 --> 12:15.526
[Daphne gasps]

12:15.609 --> 12:17.153
-Simon.
-Daphne.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.029
-I want you--
-Shh.

12:24.952 --> 12:25.953
[Daphne moans]

12:35.212 --> 12:36.839
[Daphne gasping]

12:40.551 --> 12:41.552
[Daphne] Oh!

12:43.262 --> 12:45.556
[Daphne grunting, panting]

12:52.646 --> 12:53.689
[Daphne] Oh!

12:54.565 --> 12:55.983
[Daphne gasping]

13:00.321 --> 13:02.156
Should we go into the bedroom…

13:03.365 --> 13:05.201
and finish what we started?

13:09.914 --> 13:10.748
No.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.091
What is to become of us? Simon?

13:21.175 --> 13:24.386
If you are with child, then I shall stay
and do my duty to support you both.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.513
And if I am not?

13:25.596 --> 13:28.182
Then we shall remain married
in name only.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.099
[Daphne gasps]

13:29.183 --> 13:32.561
You will be provided for, of course,
in a manner befitting the duchess.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.980
But I shall not
darken your doorstep again.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.067
Our lives will be entirely separate.

13:38.150 --> 13:38.984
This…

13:39.652 --> 13:40.653
This cannot happen.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.739
This will not happen.
Do you understand me?

13:44.323 --> 13:45.741
That we no longer trust each other?

13:47.117 --> 13:47.993
Yes, Your Grace.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.287
I understand that quite well.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.334
[door slams]

14:15.896 --> 14:16.981
[door opens]

14:17.606 --> 14:18.774
[Daphne clears throat]

14:19.608 --> 14:20.568
Miss Thompson.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.904
Thank you for joining us.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.489
I did not realize I had a choice.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.116
My brother wished for an audience.

14:27.950 --> 14:32.037
And I wish to avoid any further scandal
attached to my family's name.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.332
I will remain here as a chaperone.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.672
Marina… you must tell me
that this Whistledown woman is mistaken.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.924
What she wrote, it cannot be true.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.259
But it is.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.471
You are with child?

14:50.764 --> 14:51.849
I do not understand.

14:51.932 --> 14:55.269
We were to be wed.
You… You said you loved me.

14:55.352 --> 14:58.856
-Colin, I hold you in the greatest esteem.
-"Esteem"?

14:58.939 --> 15:03.235
You are a cruel woman indeed to stand here
and talk of friendly affection,

15:03.319 --> 15:05.863
as if you have not just committed
a grave sin against me.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.656
Speak not of sin, Mr. Bridgerton.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.703
I did not come here
to be shamed by you, nor anyone else.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.420
I did not know better.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.548
You may think me a villain,
but I did what I thought I must.

15:26.592 --> 15:30.179
No one ever truly helped me,
or guided me in a different direction.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.097
I had no choice.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.309
I needed to wed.
And you, you were the only man

15:35.392 --> 15:37.561
who offered me
even a glimpse of happiness.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.563
So I should feel flattered, then?

15:40.439 --> 15:42.942
Consider myself lucky that you chose me,

15:43.025 --> 15:45.903
lied to me, tried to trick me
into a fraud of a marriage?

15:53.869 --> 15:56.246
I shall take my leave of you
for the last time, Miss Thompson.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.138
You wish to know
the cruelest part of your deception?

16:14.848 --> 16:17.935
If you had simply come to me
and told me of your situation…

16:18.769 --> 16:20.646
I'd have married you
without a second thought.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.942
That is how in love
I believed myself to be.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.863
But I see now that was all a lie.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.078
[door slams]

16:38.872 --> 16:39.790
[inhales]

16:40.874 --> 16:43.377
I believe I would like to return home now.

16:44.753 --> 16:48.132
After all, we don't want another scandal
attached to your family name.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.301
[door opens]

16:54.638 --> 16:57.975
The carriage is waiting, ma'am.
We must prepare for the queen's luncheon.

16:58.058 --> 16:58.892
Of course.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.814
[violin quintet playing]

17:03.897 --> 17:05.899
[guests chattering]

17:20.998 --> 17:22.833
Oh, is this not lovely?

17:22.916 --> 17:24.918
All of us together again.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.755
Lovely, indeed.
We should tempt scandal more often.

17:31.717 --> 17:35.387
-Duchess, may I say how well you look?
-Oh, you are too kind.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.306
Is it not marvelous to be wed?

17:37.389 --> 17:39.933
It is both a joy and a wonder indeed.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.602
[Queen Charlotte] Make way!

17:41.685 --> 17:44.354
Must you all act
like sheep flocking to the trough?

17:45.981 --> 17:47.524
I have 100 guineas wagered

17:47.608 --> 17:49.943
on there being a Hastings heir
within the year.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.320
Are you yet with child?

17:51.403 --> 17:53.489
We have certainly been
devoting our energies

17:53.572 --> 17:55.199
to the endeavor, Your Majesty.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.367
We should hope
to see our queen soon satisfied.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.661
See to it that you do.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.335
Your duplicity comes so naturally.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.462
I seem to have learned from the best.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.175
I've missed you at the studio of late.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.344
You must join me
for another drawing lesson.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.097
As I said,
improvement is all a matter of practice.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.182
At least, that is the excuse he gives

18:20.265 --> 18:23.602
for coming home with paint
in all kinds of peculiar places.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.395
-[giggles]
-[Henry chuckles]

18:27.815 --> 18:28.649
[Henry] Ah!

18:28.732 --> 18:31.485
Were you able to meet
my friend Wetherby at my party?

18:31.568 --> 18:34.822
-Come, I shall introduce you.
-No, thank you.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.616
I-- I see my mother requires my presence.
Good day!

18:42.704 --> 18:44.665
Her Majesty requires an audience.

18:44.748 --> 18:45.999
With-- With me? Now?

18:48.085 --> 18:49.628
Ah. Here.

18:49.711 --> 18:50.712
[dog barking]

18:51.839 --> 18:52.881
Shoo.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.015
Who is she?

19:02.808 --> 19:03.684
Your Majesty?

19:03.767 --> 19:04.810
-Whistledown!
-Oh.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.146
I tasked you
with unmasking the scandalmonger.

19:07.229 --> 19:10.858
Believe me, I am intent on locating her
and am angry at myself

19:10.941 --> 19:13.777
for having not yet uncovered her identity.
But I was thinking--

19:13.861 --> 19:15.154
Clearly not fast enough.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.905
My patience has limits.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.991
-Mm.
-Get me an answer.

19:19.658 --> 19:20.993
Your queen commands it.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.035
Of course.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.913
Your Majesty. [clears throat]

19:27.124 --> 19:29.793
So, you have returned.

19:30.627 --> 19:31.587
Excellent timing,

19:31.670 --> 19:33.964
what with all the tittle-tattle
concerning your brother.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.718
Oh, a mere coincidence,
Lady Danbury, I am sure.

19:37.801 --> 19:40.220
Mm. Your plan is working.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.972
I have heard nary a peep

19:42.055 --> 19:44.474
about Mr. Bridgerton's
unfortunate entanglement

19:44.558 --> 19:45.684
with the Thompson girl.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.394
Oh, I almost forgot.

19:47.477 --> 19:50.856
I am hosting a party
I would very much like you to attend.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.691
We love a good party.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.653
I am not sure
when we will be accepting invitations.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.447
It is an invitation for one.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.366
Only you, Your Grace.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.870
A special soiree
with the married ladies of the ton,

20:04.953 --> 20:07.414
of which you are the newest member.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.007
[inaudible murmuring]

20:26.099 --> 20:27.935
The audacity.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.772
After they tried
to entrap poor Mr. Bridgerton

20:31.855 --> 20:33.774
into marriage with a woman with child.

20:33.857 --> 20:34.942
[Lady Cowper scoffs]

20:38.195 --> 20:39.154
Pen…

20:42.532 --> 20:45.077
How are you faring?
Has it been terrible at the house?

20:45.661 --> 20:49.206
We've not had a caller in three days.
My mother swears we are ruined.

20:49.873 --> 20:53.752
But what of Colin?
Is he in pieces from the news?

20:53.835 --> 20:55.963
His pride is wounded,
but he will be quite well.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.465
The gentlemen always are
in these matters, but…

20:58.548 --> 21:00.550
Pen, you have not heard
what people are saying.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.844
Lady Whistledown
has gone too far this time.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.429
And I thought you her greatest admirer.

21:04.513 --> 21:07.307
Not when she has smeared
the name of my greatest friend.

21:07.849 --> 21:09.393
When we uncover Whistledown's identity,

21:09.476 --> 21:11.311
we will convince her
to publish a retraction

21:11.395 --> 21:13.272
and restore your family's reputation.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.565
All will be well again, I promise you.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.360
My dear Lady Bridgerton…

21:19.111 --> 21:22.572
is this not a dreadful circumstance,
for us both to have been so duped

21:22.656 --> 21:24.241
by that scheming hussy?

21:25.492 --> 21:28.704
To think that Miss Thompson
would take advantage of my kindness

21:28.787 --> 21:30.622
after I opened my home to her.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.249
You must believe,

21:32.332 --> 21:34.835
I had no idea of--

21:40.716 --> 21:42.926
Lady Featherington,
I must ask you to leave.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.305
-But I have an invitation.
-Not anymore.

21:46.388 --> 21:49.099
I am sure you wish to avoid
any further unpleasantness.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.117
-That should teach them.
-[Lady Cowper snickers]

22:07.200 --> 22:09.494
Teach them what, Miss Cowper?

22:09.578 --> 22:13.123
Judging not, lest we too be judged?

22:23.884 --> 22:25.260
[Daphne sighs]

22:34.853 --> 22:35.896
Something troubles you.

22:39.524 --> 22:42.235
I know you are a grown woman now,
but I am still your mother,

22:42.319 --> 22:44.613
and you can come to me
when you need advice.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.115
Marriage has its joys,

22:47.199 --> 22:50.077
but it also brings with it
its special trials.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.412
In that, you are correct.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.540
My marriage is far from perfect.

22:55.624 --> 22:59.378
Well, then, share your thoughts.
Perhaps I can offer my wisdom.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.171
Or perhaps you will send me off

23:01.254 --> 23:03.382
with more vague metaphors

23:03.465 --> 23:04.841
and trite remarks.

23:05.509 --> 23:06.343
Darling, I--

23:06.426 --> 23:08.720
I am… merely trying to be of help.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.098
Do you know
what might have truly helped matters?

23:11.973 --> 23:16.436
If your motherly advice
had actually prepared me to wed.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.773
-Whatever do you mean?
-I mean you sent me out into the world

23:19.856 --> 23:21.149
no better than a fool.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.028
You taught me how to play pretend,

23:25.112 --> 23:28.532
but nothing
of the realities of married life,

23:29.449 --> 23:32.577
of marital relations.

23:34.287 --> 23:37.624
If you had informed me about the things
that were truly important,

23:37.707 --> 23:40.335
if I'd have known the truth,
then perhaps I--

23:45.382 --> 23:46.550
Daphne!

23:52.264 --> 23:53.098
It is the heat.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.060
The duchess is quite overcome.

24:05.318 --> 24:09.030
We were ridiculed by all today,
treated as though we were worthless,

24:09.114 --> 24:10.240
and it's all your fault.

24:10.323 --> 24:11.908
How could I have been at fault?

24:12.492 --> 24:13.827
I was not even there.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.162
If it were not for your habit,

24:15.745 --> 24:17.747
we'd have been able
to rid ourselves of Miss Thompson

24:17.831 --> 24:19.833
the moment we learned of her condition.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.918
[shakily] None of this
would have happened.

24:22.502 --> 24:23.670
My lady.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.881
The Duchess of Hastings…

24:25.964 --> 24:26.923
She is here.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.270
I am so glad
you thought to visit us, Your Grace.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.898
I fear your mother was rather heated
at the luncheon.

24:42.981 --> 24:46.610
But of course,
if you have come to offer an explanation…

24:47.777 --> 24:49.196
I require a word with Miss Thompson.

24:50.572 --> 24:51.490
Alone.

24:53.617 --> 24:54.451
Well…

24:57.078 --> 24:59.206
For what it is worth, I am sorry.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.999
Your brother is a sweet boy.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.292
You do not need to--

25:02.876 --> 25:05.420
[inhales sharply]
I came here to apologize to you.

25:06.087 --> 25:06.922
To me?

25:07.005 --> 25:11.510
I misjudged you, and I wanted to tell you
that what you felt you had to do…

25:12.594 --> 25:13.678
I understand.

25:14.387 --> 25:16.515
I wish it had not happened this way.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.433
You are certainly not the only one.

25:21.269 --> 25:22.521
George was a soldier…

25:24.481 --> 25:26.399
but he was also gentle and kind.

25:27.692 --> 25:28.818
He was perfect.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.740
I fancied myself in love.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.828
The next thing I knew, my courses stopped,

25:38.912 --> 25:41.331
and I found myself with child, and…

25:46.127 --> 25:46.962
and alone.

25:48.880 --> 25:49.756
[inhales sharply]

25:49.839 --> 25:51.550
What is Sir George's surname?

25:53.134 --> 25:55.720
Or do you know
where he is stationed, his regiment?

25:55.804 --> 25:57.931
Whatever for, Your Grace?

25:58.014 --> 26:00.392
I hear General Langham
and his wife are in London.

26:01.268 --> 26:04.688
Perhaps I could speak to him or her
and have…

26:04.771 --> 26:06.022
have Sir George found.

26:07.232 --> 26:08.525
What use would that be?

26:08.608 --> 26:10.902
George does not want to be with me.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.821
But do you really want to be alone?

26:13.488 --> 26:15.323
No rank, no protection,

26:15.907 --> 26:17.701
no support for you or your child.

26:18.201 --> 26:20.287
Surely anything is better than that.

26:20.370 --> 26:23.790
Why should he be the one
to choose your future

26:23.873 --> 26:26.042
when he clearly cares not for the outcome?

26:26.543 --> 26:28.044
He is at fault here.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.257
Perhaps I can make him come back…

26:32.924 --> 26:35.760
and take responsibility
for you and his child.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.641
Why should you be left all alone
to bear the punishment for his crime?

26:43.893 --> 26:45.895
You truly think you can do this?

26:46.479 --> 26:48.189
I assure you, Miss Thompson…

26:49.149 --> 26:51.359
I am quite capable
of doing more than you think.

27:10.920 --> 27:14.424
I have defeated the best, and
I'm confident I shall continue to do so.

27:14.507 --> 27:15.383
Mm.

27:15.467 --> 27:20.347
There is an appetite for my exhibitions,
but they are expensive, which is why--

27:20.430 --> 27:21.556
I am not here to invest.

27:22.223 --> 27:25.101
I have a more lucrative proposition
in mind.

27:25.185 --> 27:27.896
Say, for you and I
to come to some arrangement…

27:28.730 --> 27:30.440
as to the outcome of your next fight?

27:32.901 --> 27:35.737
I'm sorry
to have taken your time, my lord,

27:35.820 --> 27:38.073
but I think you would be wise to leave.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.282
And you'd be wise to listen.

27:40.617 --> 27:43.828
Would you rather stake your fortunes
on the outcome of a business scheme,

27:43.912 --> 27:46.665
which may very well fail,
or back the sure thing?

27:47.582 --> 27:49.417
You agree to throw your next match…

27:50.377 --> 27:52.504
and I will make such a wager
on your opponent

27:52.587 --> 27:56.424
that even half my winnings
will set you and your family up for life.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.885
My honor is not for sale.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.223
[tense music plays]

28:13.775 --> 28:16.736
There is a reason
your backers are dwindling, Mr. Mondrich.

28:17.987 --> 28:20.407
You're a performer, a mere entertainment.

28:21.199 --> 28:24.369
We are happy to trade wages
on the outcome of your fists,

28:24.452 --> 28:29.457
but no gentleman will ever see you
as a respectable man of business.

28:30.166 --> 28:32.794
I know you have a fighting spirit…

28:33.962 --> 28:36.214
passed down by your father, no doubt.

28:37.006 --> 28:38.508
He was a soldier, yeah?

28:39.008 --> 28:42.303
Managed to flee the colonies
after serving in Dunmore's regiment.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.141
Do you think he sought his freedom

28:46.683 --> 28:49.769
all for his future son
to become some exhausted fighter,

28:49.853 --> 28:53.565
stumbling into the ring
to put food on the table for his family?

28:55.191 --> 28:57.235
Do not dare speak of my family.

28:57.318 --> 28:58.319
[breathing heavily]

28:58.403 --> 28:59.571
Of course.

28:59.654 --> 29:01.531
I… I apologize.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.616
[breathes heavily]

29:04.784 --> 29:06.119
I only mean to say, I…

29:06.202 --> 29:07.912
I'm doing this for my family too.

29:08.705 --> 29:11.541
Look, one simple arrangement,

29:11.624 --> 29:13.501
and both our problems will be solved.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.674
I merely ask that you have a think on it…

29:20.759 --> 29:21.885
at the very least.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.362
[Rose] The ton has been desperate
for you since you returned.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.281
We've been drowning in calling cards.

29:43.364 --> 29:46.451
Lady Danbury requires your attendance
at her party on Thursday.

29:46.534 --> 29:49.037
Mm. A collection of married ladies.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.539
I can only imagine
the questions they will have for me.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.459
I shall inform her footman that
you are not feeling well from the travel.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.419
-Your Grace.
-Your Grace.

29:59.589 --> 30:03.885
Do you suppose the general's wife will be
in attendance at Lady Danbury's soiree?

30:03.968 --> 30:04.803
Mrs. Langham?

30:05.804 --> 30:07.347
I heard she enjoys society.

30:07.430 --> 30:08.848
Then send word back.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.183
I would love to attend.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.875
[boisterous chatter and laughter]

30:45.718 --> 30:46.803
Your Grace.

30:48.638 --> 30:51.558
Welcome to my den of iniquity.

31:01.776 --> 31:04.195
I believe you already know
Lady Trowbridge, Your Grace,

31:04.279 --> 31:06.573
but have you met Lucy Granville?

31:07.115 --> 31:09.033
And this is Kitty Langham.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.536
The general's wife, yes.

31:12.787 --> 31:14.372
Well, lovely to meet you all.

31:15.498 --> 31:17.458
Well, do not just stare.

31:17.542 --> 31:18.918
Deal the duchess in.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.796
We shall teach you the rules.

31:21.880 --> 31:26.134
First, a woman takes her wedding vows,
then we gamblers take her virtue.

31:26.885 --> 31:30.471
-If her husband has left any to be taken.
-[women laughing]

31:30.555 --> 31:32.348
[Lady Danbury] Have no fear.

31:32.432 --> 31:34.183
Each turn, all you have to do

31:34.267 --> 31:36.811
is set your token on the card

31:36.895 --> 31:39.230
you believe the dealer will turn over.

31:39.314 --> 31:42.233
Now, ladies, place your bets.

31:43.818 --> 31:46.529
Takes away the sting of losing,
I rather think.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.074
[Lady Danbury]
The duchess is a quick study.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.785
I'm sure she will have
the measure of things in no time.

31:53.369 --> 31:57.415
All it takes is
a little practice and perseverance.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.796
[Lady Trowbridge groans]

32:03.880 --> 32:04.881
Oh!

32:11.471 --> 32:12.680
Evening, Your Grace.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.892
It's funny meeting you here.

32:15.975 --> 32:17.727
I am utterly comical.

32:17.810 --> 32:20.688
-You've been avoiding me.
-Now you are being the jester.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.983
If you're not avoiding my company,
you won't mind if I join you for a drink?

32:24.817 --> 32:25.985
[door opens]

32:26.069 --> 32:28.071
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

32:58.393 --> 33:00.770
-I shall need a large glass.
-[waiter] Yes, sir.

33:02.397 --> 33:03.731
[excited chatter]

33:07.276 --> 33:08.569
[Lady Trowbridge groans]

33:08.653 --> 33:11.698
The earl would have my head
if he knew how much money I have lost.

33:11.781 --> 33:13.449
The earl is but two years old.

33:13.533 --> 33:16.869
Hmm. Well, then, I'm in luck, am I not?

33:16.953 --> 33:19.038
[women laughing]

33:24.002 --> 33:26.796
Seems I have been blessed
with some beginner's luck.

33:26.879 --> 33:29.173
The game is not over yet, Your Grace.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.425
[Daphne chuckles]

33:30.508 --> 33:32.552
I wonder, Mrs. Langham--

33:32.635 --> 33:34.095
"Kitty," please.

33:34.178 --> 33:36.973
You have won so much of my money,
it is only right.

33:37.056 --> 33:38.641
[chuckles] Kitty, then.

33:39.517 --> 33:42.770
There is a soldier in service
I am hoping to find for a friend.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.314
Do you think your husband
might be able to assist me?

33:45.398 --> 33:47.775
You will have to ask that of him yourself.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.027
He is so rarely at home.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.028
I am so sorry.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.863
[chuckles] Whatever for?

33:51.946 --> 33:55.450
It is quite the ideal situation
to live a separate life to one's husband.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.452
I am afforded all the freedoms of marriage

33:57.535 --> 34:00.329
while bearing none of the burden
of his company.

34:01.080 --> 34:04.417
Well, what of your children?
Do they not miss their father?

34:04.500 --> 34:07.003
It's difficult to miss
someone you've never known.

34:07.086 --> 34:12.258
You forget the duchess is still
in the first bloom of marriage.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.262
Yes, the famous love match.

34:16.345 --> 34:19.098
-[chuckles]
-Pay me no heed.

34:19.182 --> 34:23.019
The duke's company, I am sure,
is anything but a burden to you.

34:23.978 --> 34:26.647
I can tell you where to write. My husband.

34:26.731 --> 34:29.358
Perhaps the general
will grant you a response.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.277
It is not as if you are his wife.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.945
[both chuckle]

34:34.197 --> 34:35.990
Duchess, you win again!

34:36.074 --> 34:37.617
[Daphne laughs]

34:37.700 --> 34:39.410
Seeing how you entertain yourself,

34:39.494 --> 34:41.871
I rather think
you the victor, Lady Danbury.

34:41.954 --> 34:44.082
-[Kitty laughs]
-I rather think so too.

34:44.582 --> 34:45.416
Again.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.542
[chuckles]

34:48.169 --> 34:49.170
It's a fine color.

34:50.379 --> 34:51.297
And the bubbles…

34:53.800 --> 34:54.717
[satisfied exhale]

34:54.801 --> 34:55.635
Just right.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.221
Don't get me wrong. I love a good brandy.

34:58.971 --> 35:02.892
-But sometimes, nothing'll do but a beer.
-Would you just get to the point?

35:02.975 --> 35:05.937
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Yes, you do.

35:06.604 --> 35:07.438
You're correct. I do.

35:08.064 --> 35:11.109
Just like I know that you've obviously
made a considerable error with my sister.

35:11.192 --> 35:14.278
How, may I ask, could you infer
that I was the one to make the error?

35:14.362 --> 35:16.364
Well, I know my sister quite well.

35:16.948 --> 35:20.118
And while she is
an unusually capable woman,

35:20.201 --> 35:22.745
she is not capable
of fucking up this severely.

35:24.580 --> 35:27.166
Do you not ever get tired
of pretending to be so perfect?

35:27.250 --> 35:29.502
-[Anthony chuckles]
-It's exhausting just watching you.

35:29.585 --> 35:31.879
We may not be perfect,
but at least we keep our promises.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.674
You know nothing of my commitments.
I'm trying to be a man of my word.

35:34.757 --> 35:35.800
I am trying to keep--

35:37.009 --> 35:38.094
[Simon sighs]

35:38.719 --> 35:41.180
-I wouldn't expect you to understand.
-What do you mean by that?

35:41.264 --> 35:43.599
I mean that you leave
a litany of broken promises

35:43.683 --> 35:45.101
behind you everywhere you go.

35:45.184 --> 35:47.353
Your duty to protect Daphne
from Nigel Berbrooke?

35:47.436 --> 35:48.896
What about your own reckless affairs,

35:48.980 --> 35:51.107
seeing that opera singer
you believe no one knows about?

35:51.190 --> 35:52.024
You judge me,

35:52.108 --> 35:54.735
yet you can't understand
the responsibility of heading a family,

35:54.819 --> 35:56.112
because you've never had one.

35:56.195 --> 35:58.698
But Daphne is my family now,
and there is no changing that.

35:58.781 --> 36:01.742
Though it is most unfortunate
that I shall never quite reach

36:01.826 --> 36:03.661
the lofty ideal you have demonstrated.

36:03.744 --> 36:07.123
What is most unfortunate is the fact
that your father was so absent,

36:07.206 --> 36:09.876
he never gave you a proper example
of how to lead a household.

36:20.678 --> 36:23.222
Well,
you certainly make it look difficult.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.852
-I beg your pardon?
-With your constant struggles.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.562
-You cannot manage it, can you?
-Hastings--

36:29.645 --> 36:31.022
Your responsibility.

36:31.105 --> 36:32.690
You, fulfilling the promise

36:32.773 --> 36:35.985
that every firstborn son makes
to his father before he dies.

36:36.068 --> 36:37.320
[Anthony exhales deeply]

36:37.987 --> 36:41.073
Do you think
he is looking down on you now, ashamed?

36:42.074 --> 36:43.993
Mortified at what you have done?

36:44.076 --> 36:47.038
I wonder,
what would the former viscount say?

36:49.582 --> 36:50.708
[Anthony roars]

36:51.292 --> 36:52.835
[both grunting]

36:54.503 --> 36:55.630
[Anthony roars]

36:58.883 --> 37:00.509
[man 1] Calm down! Get off him!

37:02.094 --> 37:04.639
-[indistinct yelling]
-[man 2] Calm down!

37:04.722 --> 37:06.057
[man 1] Get off!

37:07.266 --> 37:08.935
-[Anthony grunting]
-[Simon panting]

37:28.412 --> 37:29.747
[Simon sighs softly]

37:40.341 --> 37:43.094
It seems I became a little too rough
training with Will.

37:53.145 --> 37:55.189
-Shall I call for Jeffries?
-No.

38:01.696 --> 38:02.613
Let me.

38:03.572 --> 38:04.615
With four brothers,

38:04.699 --> 38:08.577
you cannot imagine the nasty cuts
I have tended to over the years. [laughs]

38:21.674 --> 38:22.925
[inhales sharply, grunts]

38:25.511 --> 38:27.388
[soft music playing]

39:03.049 --> 39:05.676
Why will you not unfold yourself to me?

39:05.760 --> 39:06.635
Daphne…

39:10.681 --> 39:12.725
A child would be a blessing.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.486
Tell me why you are so adamant.

39:23.569 --> 39:26.405
Because I swore a long time ago
that I would never sire a child.

39:27.656 --> 39:28.908
I do not understand.

39:30.659 --> 39:31.869
My father…

39:33.788 --> 39:37.875
cared more about the continuation
of the Hastings line…

39:39.126 --> 39:40.336
than anything in the world.

39:43.339 --> 39:44.548
More than my mother.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.301
More than me.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.221
And so I made a vow

39:50.304 --> 39:52.890
that his efforts would be in vain…

39:54.892 --> 39:58.437
that the line would die with me.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.569
So this is all…

40:07.321 --> 40:08.656
because of a vow?

40:11.826 --> 40:15.663
You made a vow to me too. Or…
Or has our wedding day slipped your mind?

40:15.746 --> 40:16.580
I told you--

40:16.664 --> 40:20.042
You told me
that you could not have children.

40:21.085 --> 40:24.713
You did not tell me it was some--
some token of revenge

40:24.797 --> 40:27.007
against a man
who no longer walks this earth.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.218
I swore to him on his deathbed.

40:29.301 --> 40:32.721
And you betrayed me in our marriage bed.

40:40.062 --> 40:41.939
Let me be certain I understand.

40:42.940 --> 40:47.736
You will neither have children,
nor the happiness we could have together,

40:47.820 --> 40:50.364
because you promised
your father you would not?

40:50.906 --> 40:51.782
I…

40:52.825 --> 40:53.701
[Daphne] Say it.

40:55.327 --> 40:56.245
Say it.

40:56.328 --> 40:58.247
It cannot be undone.

41:02.042 --> 41:04.837
Then I thank you
for your elucidation, Your Grace.

41:06.088 --> 41:07.715
If your hatred for your father outweighs

41:07.798 --> 41:11.218
any affection
that you might bear towards me…

41:12.636 --> 41:13.804
then you are right.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.265
It cannot be undone.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.895
My courses are due
within the next few days.

41:21.604 --> 41:23.856
You will know then
which vow you have broken,

41:23.939 --> 41:26.400
and how we are to spend
the rest of our lives,

41:26.484 --> 41:27.943
miserable together…

41:29.236 --> 41:30.905
or perfectly happy apart.

41:38.621 --> 41:41.415
[Lady Whistledown]
Dearest reader, a question.

41:41.499 --> 41:46.253
Is anything more exhilarating
than taking a gamble?

41:46.337 --> 41:50.549
For it is often the highest risk
that carries the greatest reward.

41:57.806 --> 42:00.684
Yet, wager wrongly,

42:00.768 --> 42:04.063
and you might find yourself left
with nothing but regret.

42:06.982 --> 42:09.944
-Ensure it is delivered to this address.
-Yes, Your Grace.

42:10.444 --> 42:13.405
[Lady Whistledown]
Of course, one can never know for sure

42:13.489 --> 42:17.034
whether a wager
will make a fortune or ruin it,

42:17.117 --> 42:20.454
unless one chooses a more secure pursuit.

42:23.791 --> 42:26.293
But as the season continues,

42:26.377 --> 42:30.673
the biggest gamblers
have yet to truly show their hand…

42:31.757 --> 42:35.094
which leaves gossip
in short supply in recent days.

42:35.719 --> 42:40.641
In fact, this author can think
of no other event that merits a mention.

42:41.433 --> 42:42.726
"No other event."

42:43.811 --> 42:44.812
But my luncheon.

42:45.771 --> 42:48.190
At least she did not say anything odious.

42:49.191 --> 42:50.359
It is far worse.

42:51.443 --> 42:53.320
She wrote nothing.

43:01.495 --> 43:04.748
[Lady Whistledown]
It is worthy of note, however,

43:04.832 --> 43:07.042
that the Duke and Duchess of Hastings

43:07.126 --> 43:09.920
have yet to entertain callers together.

43:14.717 --> 43:17.595
Our newlyweds are no doubt still secluded

43:17.678 --> 43:20.222
in nuptial bliss.

43:23.475 --> 43:24.893
Who could fault them?

43:24.977 --> 43:26.478
And who could be surprised

43:26.562 --> 43:29.732
if their diligent efforts are rewarded

43:29.815 --> 43:33.444
with a new arrival within the year?

43:45.581 --> 43:47.875
In the past, every Whistledown revelation

43:47.958 --> 43:50.085
appeared to be plucked
from a public event,

43:50.169 --> 43:51.920
where any of our ton
could have borne witness.

43:52.004 --> 43:53.964
But the column
that singled out Marina was different.

43:54.048 --> 43:54.923
It was personal.

43:55.007 --> 43:57.635
Your mama did not just help Marina
hide her condition all on her own.

43:57.718 --> 43:59.762
Of course not.
Every servant in our household knew.

43:59.845 --> 44:01.722
A servant is unlikely.

44:03.849 --> 44:05.559
Though, perhaps a tradesperson.

44:05.643 --> 44:08.020
Someone who visited
your household regularly

44:08.103 --> 44:09.897
might have seen or overheard something.

44:09.980 --> 44:10.898
It is a possibility.

44:10.981 --> 44:13.734
In that case, we must reconsider
our methods of inquiry to this end.

44:14.360 --> 44:17.571
This is wonderful, Pen.
I must tell the queen of our new theory.

44:18.405 --> 44:20.282
Then tell her at tonight's concert.

44:22.618 --> 44:23.869
I know you are not yet out,

44:23.952 --> 44:26.372
but I am sure your mama
would still allow you to attend.

44:26.455 --> 44:28.082
Once we unmask Whistledown--

44:28.165 --> 44:30.751
Yes, yes,
the Featherington honor will be restored.

44:31.293 --> 44:32.836
I must return home.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.130
I shall take the back stairs
so no one will see me.

44:35.756 --> 44:36.924
And, El?

44:37.966 --> 44:38.842
Thank you.

44:44.098 --> 44:45.474
I wrote to General Langham,

44:46.141 --> 44:48.352
and I have told him all about Sir George.

44:48.435 --> 44:49.478
If he is a man of honor--

44:49.561 --> 44:52.106
-You wrote to the general?
-Yes.

44:52.189 --> 44:55.651
And did the duke
sign his name as well on this letter?

44:57.319 --> 44:58.195
Well…

44:59.113 --> 44:59.947
no.

45:00.739 --> 45:01.615
But--

45:03.742 --> 45:04.952
Marina, what is it?

45:05.828 --> 45:08.706
The general will not concern himself
to write back to you, Your Grace.

45:10.082 --> 45:11.500
You do not know that.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.962
He will pay attention
to the words of a duchess.

45:15.045 --> 45:16.130
He must.

45:16.213 --> 45:17.339
Are you so unworldly?

45:18.090 --> 45:19.925
I… I'm sorry.

45:20.008 --> 45:24.304
I… Your help is greatly appreciated,
but there is nothing more you can do.

45:24.388 --> 45:26.098
-Marina--
-It is over.

45:26.849 --> 45:28.726
I have already accepted the fact.

45:30.018 --> 45:31.437
Thank you for your efforts.

45:38.902 --> 45:39.945
[Daphne sighs]

45:42.197 --> 45:44.032
-Missing the concert?
-Indeed.

45:45.117 --> 45:47.870
Not exactly in the mood
for music and finery this evening.

45:52.499 --> 45:53.709
I want to apologize.

45:57.463 --> 46:00.174
Are there locusts in the streets?
Blood in the Thames?

46:00.257 --> 46:01.800
Are the end of days upon us already?

46:01.884 --> 46:03.719
I may have been a trifle harsh with you.

46:05.304 --> 46:06.555
And I'm sorry.

46:07.556 --> 46:09.767
You merely wished to protect me
from my more…

46:10.392 --> 46:11.477
foolish impulses.

46:11.560 --> 46:13.479
So you admit it now?
You were acting a fool?

46:13.562 --> 46:16.106
-As apologies go, this is certainly novel.
-Hush, you.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.441
[Colin chuckles]

46:19.610 --> 46:21.653
You may hurt now, but the pain will pass.

46:22.237 --> 46:24.615
You have the love of all your family

46:24.698 --> 46:26.950
and the honor of your actions.

46:27.743 --> 46:30.579
Soon you will forget Miss Thompson's name,
and it will-- [sighs]

46:32.664 --> 46:34.875
It will be
as if you never loved her at all.

46:35.959 --> 46:37.961
And how have these precepts served you?

46:38.712 --> 46:41.590
Aside from being
the most dismal, troubling ones

46:41.673 --> 46:43.050
I've heard in quite some time.

46:43.133 --> 46:45.177
It's a work in progress, to be sure.

46:45.260 --> 46:46.303
[both chuckle]

46:48.305 --> 46:51.225
I suppose I was surprised to hear
you wished to join us this evening.

46:51.308 --> 46:52.601
And I suppose I must be grateful

46:52.684 --> 46:54.686
for your restraint
in not using any feathers.

46:54.770 --> 46:55.771
[Violet laughs]

46:55.854 --> 46:57.397
-You look lovely.
-Mm.

46:59.358 --> 47:00.859
Eloise… [sighs]

47:03.403 --> 47:08.325
Taking your place in society should be
an exciting time in a young woman's life.

47:09.451 --> 47:13.163
If you are not truly ready,
I shall not ask you to play pretend.

47:14.456 --> 47:16.375
Perhaps I have been rushing you.

47:17.459 --> 47:20.462
We need not hasten your coming out
before you feel prepared.

47:27.219 --> 47:30.347
The queen will be in attendance
at tonight's concert, will she not?

47:30.430 --> 47:31.598
I believe she will.

47:32.850 --> 47:34.518
Then I am looking forward to it.

47:34.601 --> 47:36.520
An exciting time indeed, Mama.

47:58.876 --> 47:59.835
Are you ready?

48:00.836 --> 48:01.753
I am.

48:06.633 --> 48:07.801
[guests chattering]

48:07.885 --> 48:09.177
[violin quintet playing]

48:21.899 --> 48:24.276
[indistinct chatter]

48:28.530 --> 48:29.364
Excuse me.

48:35.495 --> 48:36.580
Sir Granville.

48:37.831 --> 48:38.665
Bridgerton.

48:39.541 --> 48:40.417
Sorry.

48:41.084 --> 48:42.169
Excuse us.

48:44.546 --> 48:46.924
I would simply like to understand your…

48:49.176 --> 48:50.344
situation.

48:50.427 --> 48:51.678
[Henry sighs]

48:51.762 --> 48:54.306
-I would just like to understand.
-It is simple.

48:55.265 --> 48:57.017
I am in love with Lord Wetherby.

48:57.100 --> 48:58.393
You're married.

48:58.477 --> 49:01.647
And our marriage affords my wife
her freedoms and protections.

49:01.730 --> 49:02.814
It is a happier union

49:02.898 --> 49:05.734
than most of the people in this room have,
I assure you.

49:06.485 --> 49:09.279
What is the advantage for the young ladies
Lord Wetherby is courting?

49:09.363 --> 49:11.531
-Do they also share this understanding?
-[chuckles]

49:11.615 --> 49:13.450
What about honor? Romance?

49:14.034 --> 49:15.786
What would you know of either?

49:16.787 --> 49:18.705
We live under constant threat of danger.

49:18.789 --> 49:22.000
I risk my life every day for love.

49:24.795 --> 49:26.505
You have no idea what it is like

49:26.588 --> 49:28.966
to be in a room
with someone you cannot live without…

49:30.092 --> 49:33.053
and yet still feel
as though you are oceans apart.

49:33.720 --> 49:35.847
Stealing your glances,
disguising your touches.

49:35.931 --> 49:38.642
We cannot so much as smile at each other…

49:39.935 --> 49:42.396
without first ensuring
no one else is watching.

49:44.356 --> 49:46.608
It takes courage…

49:48.068 --> 49:51.405
to live outside
the traditional expectations of society.

49:52.614 --> 49:54.408
You talk of doing the same…

49:55.867 --> 49:57.369
but perhaps it is merely just that…

50:00.080 --> 50:00.914
all talk.

50:12.884 --> 50:15.303
And so you see,
Your Majesty, it is clear as day.

50:15.387 --> 50:18.473
Lady Whistledown works closely
with the members of the ton,

50:18.557 --> 50:20.183
yet she is not a member herself.

50:20.267 --> 50:22.644
She is a tradesperson.

50:23.729 --> 50:24.563
Is that all?

50:26.189 --> 50:27.149
I beg your pardon?

50:27.232 --> 50:29.359
I am no longer in need of your services.

50:30.318 --> 50:32.529
But, uh… my theory…

50:32.612 --> 50:33.822
It is not necessary.

50:33.905 --> 50:38.326
I have hired a team of Bow Street Runners
to do a proper investigation.

50:38.410 --> 50:39.995
They will unmask Whistledown,

50:40.078 --> 50:42.247
and she shall be made to pay
for her impertinence.

50:43.665 --> 50:45.167
That noxious gossip rag…

50:46.418 --> 50:48.378
will finally cease to exist.

50:48.462 --> 50:50.255
You want to silence her?

50:51.965 --> 50:54.843
-But there is still good she must do.
-[scoffs]

50:55.427 --> 50:56.887
Child, go.

51:04.478 --> 51:06.313
-How long is this concert?
-Three hours?

51:06.396 --> 51:07.439
-[groans]
-Four?

51:07.939 --> 51:10.609
Though, uh,
I certainly have already heard enough.

51:12.069 --> 51:15.030
You are my most favorite brother.
Do you know that?

51:40.972 --> 51:42.557
[horses neigh]

51:48.688 --> 51:49.648
[clears throat]

51:50.607 --> 51:53.026
I would like to make a stop
and pick up a friend.

51:53.110 --> 51:54.194
A friend?

51:55.821 --> 51:57.155
Should I not have a friend?

51:57.239 --> 51:58.573
[Eloise chuckles]

51:58.657 --> 52:00.784
I'm not bound by the rules of society.

52:02.536 --> 52:04.788
-Please do not tell Mother.
-[scoffs]

52:14.047 --> 52:15.674
Why are we at the modiste?

52:17.300 --> 52:18.343
[shop door closes]

52:22.806 --> 52:24.349
Mademoiselle Bridgerton!

52:25.851 --> 52:28.478
This is my sister, Eloise,
and we will be dropping her at home.

52:40.866 --> 52:42.284
[Benedict] Mm.

52:42.367 --> 52:43.410
[Genevieve] Hmm.

52:48.498 --> 52:50.667
How… How was your night, ma chérie?

52:50.750 --> 52:51.585
It was…

52:52.335 --> 52:53.587
everything I expected.

52:54.129 --> 52:56.131
Horrible and terribly boring.

52:56.214 --> 52:57.465
[chuckles]

52:58.258 --> 53:01.344
So this is why you do not wish
to lower your hems? [laughs]

53:03.013 --> 53:04.055
The entire ton were there,

53:04.139 --> 53:06.641
and I did not have
a single worthwhile exchange.

53:06.725 --> 53:07.767
The entire ton?

53:07.851 --> 53:10.687
You mean,
everyone except for the Featheringtons?

53:10.770 --> 53:13.064
-[Genevieve laughs]
-Yes, everyone except…

53:14.733 --> 53:15.650
them.

53:17.736 --> 53:20.280
Your mama did not just help Marina
hide her condition on her own.

53:20.363 --> 53:22.490
Of course not.
Every servant in our household knew.

53:22.574 --> 53:24.117
Though, perhaps a tradesperson?

53:24.201 --> 53:26.369
I certainly never want to cross the woman.

53:26.453 --> 53:28.580
Her word as good as gospel.

53:35.170 --> 53:38.924
Is everything well, Eloise?

53:39.716 --> 53:40.592
Hmm?

53:40.675 --> 53:41.509
Yeah.

53:50.727 --> 53:52.729
["The Four Seasons" by Vivaldi playing]

54:46.366 --> 54:48.201
[teapot whistling]

55:23.778 --> 55:25.655
[Vivaldi's "Four Seasons" continues]

55:36.750 --> 55:38.752
[Daphne gasping lightly]

55:42.339 --> 55:43.548
[gasps sharply]

55:55.643 --> 55:56.686
Marina?

55:57.437 --> 55:58.480
Can we talk?

56:02.192 --> 56:03.026
Marina?

56:04.235 --> 56:05.403
Are you still awake?

56:12.911 --> 56:13.745
[shouts] Marina!

56:14.537 --> 56:16.081
Marina! Marina!

56:16.664 --> 56:17.832
Mama!

56:18.583 --> 56:19.918
Mama, make haste!

56:20.001 --> 56:23.088
Marina? Marina, I'm here. It's okay.

56:23.171 --> 56:24.589
[Penelope gasping]

56:29.511 --> 56:30.637
[grunting]

56:43.525 --> 56:46.111
[gasping, sobbing]

56:51.032 --> 56:52.242
[Daphne gasping]

56:58.873 --> 57:00.041
[crying]

57:00.125 --> 57:01.459
[music ends]

57:02.001 --> 57:03.670
[Daphne continues crying]

57:13.596 --> 57:15.390
[sobbing]

57:18.601 --> 57:19.936
[crying continues]

57:32.740 --> 57:34.742
[instrumental music playing]
