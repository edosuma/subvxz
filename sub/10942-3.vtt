WEBVTT

00:01.807 --> 00:03.007
I've been lonely,

00:03.075 --> 00:05.309
But I didn't even know
how lonely...

00:05.377 --> 00:07.245
Until I came home.

00:07.312 --> 00:09.680
You know, you obviously
don't need me.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.348
<i>You're just fine
on your own,</i>

00:11.416 --> 00:13.217
Living your life
the way you choose.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.754
Chase powers
was on the tour, too.

00:16.821 --> 00:18.688
<i>Yes, he was.</i>

00:18.756 --> 00:19.856
You remember this?

00:22.326 --> 00:23.593
You and Blair,

00:23.661 --> 00:25.028
Was there anything at all,
between you guys,

00:25.096 --> 00:26.129
<i>When you were travelling?</i>

00:26.197 --> 00:28.331
Like...
Just be honest with me.

00:34.104 --> 00:35.637
<i>Ty;
This is me coming home,</i>

00:35.705 --> 00:37.306
Alone,

00:37.373 --> 00:38.507
<i>To you.</i>

01:08.469 --> 01:09.536
Hey.

01:11.706 --> 01:12.772
<i>Good boy.</i>

01:16.177 --> 01:17.777
<i>Good boy.</i>

01:17.846 --> 01:19.146
<i>So what I'm doing, folks,</i>

01:19.214 --> 01:21.447
Is advancing and retreating.

01:21.514 --> 01:24.317
So now,
I'm just gonna walk away.

01:37.330 --> 01:38.796
And now he's with me.

01:53.044 --> 01:55.246
<i>Well, we now know
domino's sensitive side -</i>

01:55.313 --> 01:56.680
The left.

01:57.349 --> 01:59.516
So I'm gonna give him a bit
of a break from this side

01:59.584 --> 02:00.550
Before I work with it again

02:00.618 --> 02:02.452
Because, remember, for a horse,

02:02.520 --> 02:04.154
Relief equals reward.

02:06.024 --> 02:07.424
Hey, you're doing great.

02:07.492 --> 02:09.092
Where's Ty?

02:09.158 --> 02:12.228
He said he was gonna be here
by now.

02:13.864 --> 02:16.099
Yes, I've been to your website.

02:16.166 --> 02:19.903
No, I need to speak
to the registrar in person.

02:20.837 --> 02:22.405
Yeah, about the fees.

02:23.340 --> 02:25.073
Okay, fine.
Uh, thank you.

02:26.009 --> 02:28.043
Yeah, thank you.
Bye.

02:44.893 --> 02:46.227
Sugarfoot, whoa!

02:47.162 --> 02:48.195
Whoa, boy!

02:48.263 --> 02:49.630
Oh my goodness...

03:15.788 --> 03:17.489
Mrs. Bell!

03:17.557 --> 03:19.291
Mrs. Bell!

03:19.359 --> 03:20.292
Mrs. Bell,
are you all right?

03:21.894 --> 03:23.329
Don't move, you might have
something broken, okay?

03:23.396 --> 03:27.166
Oh, I'd like to break
that driver's neck!

03:27.233 --> 03:30.768
Stupid blinking trucks!

03:30.836 --> 03:32.736
They think they own
the bloody road.

03:32.804 --> 03:35.239
I'm fine...

03:35.307 --> 03:36.374
I'm fine.

03:38.477 --> 03:39.543
Sugarfoot...

03:41.246 --> 03:43.247
Where's sugarfoot?

03:43.315 --> 03:45.449
What?
Where's sugarfoot?

03:45.516 --> 03:47.117
Where's sugar...

03:48.953 --> 03:50.553
<i>He's hurt.</i>

03:50.621 --> 03:52.022
He's hurt.
Okay.

03:59.930 --> 04:01.297
Here you go, boy.

04:02.232 --> 04:03.632
<i>There you go.</i>

04:07.904 --> 04:08.971
Hey.

04:11.574 --> 04:13.409
Well, this guy sure has
a mind of his own.

04:16.113 --> 04:17.411
How's it going?

All right, domino.
It's time to get back to work.

05:09.128 --> 05:11.363
I know you'd love to hang out
with those guys.

05:11.431 --> 05:13.198
<i>I'm with you, domino.</i>

05:13.266 --> 05:14.232
Go, domino!

05:23.475 --> 05:25.576
Need some help there, Amy?

05:28.880 --> 05:30.381
I could rope him for you.

05:30.449 --> 05:31.982
Might be the only way
to get him to stand,

05:32.050 --> 05:33.417
By the looks of it.

05:33.485 --> 05:36.019
Would you like to do
this clinic, Mr. Powers?

05:36.088 --> 05:37.287
Did you bring your chainsaw?

05:37.354 --> 05:38.821
'cause that would really
calm him down.

05:38.889 --> 05:39.822
Right, folks?

05:41.725 --> 05:42.559
<i>You know, better yet,
do you have fireworks?</i>

05:42.626 --> 05:43.326
'cause that would be great!

05:43.394 --> 05:45.462
You want fireworks?

05:45.529 --> 05:47.730
Now, you and me
in the same ring,

05:47.798 --> 05:49.799
That's fireworks.

05:56.772 --> 05:59.674
Hey, boy.
I'm Chase.

05:59.742 --> 06:01.276
How're you doing?

06:08.151 --> 06:09.550
Carry on.

06:12.287 --> 06:14.388
What's this, boy?

06:14.456 --> 06:15.523
Good boy.

06:19.428 --> 06:21.295
Good boy.

06:21.363 --> 06:23.564
So he's good with that
from the right...

06:23.632 --> 06:25.565
Let's see the left.

06:26.501 --> 06:28.868
And I thought I had blue eyes.

06:28.936 --> 06:30.637
Hey, if he can handle
this weight,

06:30.704 --> 06:33.006
I bet he can take a saddle.

06:33.073 --> 06:34.307
Chase,

06:34.375 --> 06:36.109
I don't think he's ready
for that yet.

06:36.177 --> 06:37.544
Did you ask him?

06:39.046 --> 06:40.980
You okay with this, boy?

06:41.048 --> 06:42.481
He said yes.

06:52.892 --> 06:56.562
No applause, please.
This is all her.

06:58.030 --> 06:59.497
<i>Up you get.</i>

07:10.276 --> 07:12.277
<i>Good boy.</i>

07:12.344 --> 07:13.910
Okay, you're okay.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.547
Good boy.

07:20.351 --> 07:21.751
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

07:21.819 --> 07:23.987
I give you Amy Fleming -
the miracle girl!

07:31.027 --> 07:32.261
That was pretty good, right?

07:32.329 --> 07:33.729
Real crowd pleaser.

07:33.797 --> 07:35.431
How dare you show up here
and just take over?

07:35.499 --> 07:37.200
Take over?
I was here to help you.

07:37.267 --> 07:39.335
Yeah, well, I don't need help.

07:39.403 --> 07:40.503
Listen, I got a proposition
for you.

07:40.571 --> 07:41.804
No, I'm not listening.

07:41.871 --> 07:45.140
Well, I got a show,
on Saturday, in Hudson.

07:45.208 --> 07:46.374
We should do it together.

07:46.442 --> 07:48.776
I got a big following.
You got...

07:48.844 --> 07:49.944
A following.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.346
We can sell a whack
of show tickets.

07:51.414 --> 07:53.047
Yeah, well, what I do
is not a show, okay?

07:53.115 --> 07:54.683
It's a clinic.

07:54.750 --> 07:57.352
Whatever.
Just think about it.

07:57.420 --> 07:58.653
We're pretty damn good
together.

07:58.721 --> 08:00.622
Can't deny that.

08:10.131 --> 08:12.199
Ty, where are you?

08:13.335 --> 08:15.703
Yeah, of course.
I'll be right there.

08:15.770 --> 08:18.938
Grandpa, can you hook up
the horse trailer, please?

08:35.554 --> 08:36.722
Oh my gosh!

08:36.789 --> 08:38.490
Look how beautiful it is
out here!

08:38.558 --> 08:41.525
Yeah, even at this
horrible state.

08:42.462 --> 08:45.363
I don't know where to begin.

08:45.430 --> 08:46.530
What?

08:46.598 --> 08:47.798
I'm a little worried about you.

08:47.866 --> 08:49.199
Are you okay?

08:49.268 --> 08:50.334
Yes.

08:51.737 --> 08:53.638
You talk to Peter?
Is he all right?

08:53.705 --> 08:55.406
He's great.

08:55.474 --> 08:57.941
Good.
That's good to hear.

08:58.877 --> 09:01.077
Well, put me to work.
I'm here to help.

09:02.246 --> 09:03.647
<i>Here you go.</i>

09:03.714 --> 09:05.181
You're all right.

09:07.418 --> 09:10.119
Crazy truck drivers.

09:10.187 --> 09:12.155
You'd think the road
was just for them!

09:12.222 --> 09:14.957
- Here you go...
- Well...

09:15.025 --> 09:18.260
I was driving along,
minding my own business,

09:18.328 --> 09:21.697
When - whoosh! -
This guy came tearing along.

09:21.765 --> 09:23.565
I just...

09:23.633 --> 09:25.033
He coulda killed us.

09:25.101 --> 09:27.002
He came this close!

09:27.069 --> 09:30.739
You know, there should be laws
about it.

09:31.674 --> 09:34.642
So, Saturday's
my mom's birthday.

09:34.710 --> 09:36.544
Yippee.

09:36.612 --> 09:39.213
I know you're a
little put off with her.

09:39.281 --> 09:41.148
Yeah, I don't know
how you can you say that.

09:41.216 --> 09:43.651
But I think that we should...

09:43.719 --> 09:44.919
Should what?

09:44.986 --> 09:46.821
Well, invite her over
for dinner.

09:46.888 --> 09:48.988
Dinner, here, at my trailer?

09:49.056 --> 09:50.624
Our trailer.

09:50.692 --> 09:52.926
I don't know, Ash.
Why not?

09:52.993 --> 09:55.128
I could bake us a cake.

09:55.196 --> 09:56.430
Look, I just...

09:56.497 --> 09:58.064
I don't think it's a good idea.

09:58.132 --> 09:59.333
In fact,

09:59.400 --> 10:01.868
I think it's a really,
really bad idea.

10:01.936 --> 10:03.002
Caleb!

10:06.306 --> 10:07.440
<i>Almost done.</i>

10:08.375 --> 10:10.175
Here we go.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.711
Easy, easy.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.914
All right, that's better.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.383
Well, the cut's not too deep.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.584
No tendons were affected
and nothing's broken.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.119
Hey, what's in that?

10:22.187 --> 10:23.822
Oh, it's my mom's recipe.

10:23.889 --> 10:25.690
It's just a bunch of
healing grasses and herbs.

10:25.758 --> 10:26.825
It'll help take away the sting

10:26.892 --> 10:28.326
And the cut will heal better.

10:28.394 --> 10:29.728
You put some yarrow in it?

10:29.795 --> 10:31.596
I did.
Good girl.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.598
Well, I'm gonna keep
sugarfoot here tonight.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.566
No, no.
He won't like that.

10:35.633 --> 10:37.401
He has to. I gotta keep
an eye on that cut

10:37.469 --> 10:38.502
And make sure it doesn't
get infected.

10:38.570 --> 10:39.936
Well, I can do that.

10:40.004 --> 10:42.038
No. That's not happening.
I'll give you a ride home,

10:42.106 --> 10:44.107
You can come back tomorrow,
anytime you like, and visit.

10:44.175 --> 10:45.942
Just give me a call
and I'll come pick you up.

10:46.010 --> 10:47.711
Oh... You're a bully.

10:51.382 --> 10:53.215
You and Amy are a good match.

10:53.283 --> 10:54.917
Don't let it get away from you.

10:54.985 --> 10:55.985
Absolutely.

10:56.052 --> 10:58.421
Oh, you think it's easy,
do you?

10:58.489 --> 10:59.822
I'll tell you what's easy.

10:59.890 --> 11:02.558
It's easy to take things
for granted in this life.

11:02.626 --> 11:05.461
You never know what's going
to come around the corner.

11:05.529 --> 11:08.663
Look at today -
some idiot driving too fast.

11:08.731 --> 11:11.299
You're here today
and then - poof!...

11:11.367 --> 11:13.268
You could be gone tomorrow.

11:13.335 --> 11:16.938
I guess... Oh, I just hope I
don't go before sugarfoot.

11:17.006 --> 11:18.072
Poor thing.

11:18.140 --> 11:19.374
What would he do without me?

11:19.442 --> 11:21.543
You'll check on him tonight,
won't you?

11:21.611 --> 11:23.344
He's not used to a stall

11:23.412 --> 11:25.613
And he'll raise the dead
with his fussing.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.115
Don't you worry, okay?
I'll look after him.

11:28.182 --> 11:31.018
Okay. When he gets like that,
I usually sing to him.

11:31.085 --> 11:32.887
- You in?
- In!

11:32.954 --> 11:35.355
<i>Now, he's never
been a fan of Elvis.</i>

11:38.894 --> 11:40.560
Well, the clinic went
pretty good this afternoon,

11:40.628 --> 11:41.661
Don't you think?

11:41.729 --> 11:42.862
Oh, yeah.
Sorry I couldn't make it.

11:42.930 --> 11:43.897
How'd it go?

11:43.964 --> 11:45.031
Okay.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.233
That Chase powers fellow,

11:47.301 --> 11:50.136
He gave quite the impromptu
performance.

11:50.203 --> 11:51.504
What was he doing here?

11:51.572 --> 11:53.105
Guess he heard
I was doing a clinic

11:53.173 --> 11:54.373
And he showed up
to give me a hard time.

11:54.442 --> 11:56.708
Well, she handled him
pretty good.

11:56.776 --> 11:58.510
Threw his crap
right back at him.

11:58.578 --> 11:59.645
You'd have been proud.

12:01.247 --> 12:02.514
Lou, sugarfoot's out
in the barn.

12:02.582 --> 12:03.549
You should go say hi
to your old buddy.

12:05.384 --> 12:06.952
What?

12:07.019 --> 12:08.921
<i>Sugarfoot.
He's out in the barn.</i>

12:08.988 --> 12:11.289
Oh yeah, yeah.
Grandpa said.

12:11.357 --> 12:15.493
I'll, uh... I'll go see him
in the morning.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.501
Well, you say you're fine,

12:23.569 --> 12:24.702
But I know you.

12:24.770 --> 12:25.870
You're not your old Lou self.

12:25.938 --> 12:27.471
You're not eating.
You're not talking.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.106
You are a worry wart.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.442
Hello?

12:32.510 --> 12:33.810
Peter!
How are ya?

12:34.579 --> 12:37.614
Ha! Geez, you sound like
you're in the next room,

12:37.682 --> 12:39.883
<i>Not halfway around
the world.</i>

12:39.951 --> 12:41.651
<i>Yeah, yeah.
Hang on, I'll...</i>

12:41.719 --> 12:43.219
<i>I'll get her.</i>

12:43.287 --> 12:44.987
Tell him,
tell him I've gone to bed.

12:45.054 --> 12:46.956
Or no, that I'm...
That I'm out.

12:48.758 --> 12:49.892
Ah, Peter.

12:49.960 --> 12:53.028
I forgot.
She's out for the evening.

12:54.564 --> 12:55.798
Yeah.

12:55.866 --> 12:57.132
Yeah, I'll let her know
you called.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.834
Sure.

12:58.902 --> 12:59.968
Okay, see you.

13:01.269 --> 13:03.270
Well, that seems
a little weird.

13:05.508 --> 13:07.241
So, what's the deal with Chase?

13:07.309 --> 13:08.476
Why do you think he showed up?

13:08.544 --> 13:09.811
Any reason?

13:09.879 --> 13:12.480
You know with Chase
there's always a reason.

13:12.548 --> 13:14.281
He wants me to do a clinic
with him in Hudson.

13:14.349 --> 13:15.883
This Saturday.

13:15.950 --> 13:18.685
Like I'd do that?

13:21.556 --> 13:25.325
<i>So, you and Chase
working together.</i>

13:25.393 --> 13:27.728
Chase n' Amy.
Cute.

13:27.795 --> 13:28.862
I don't believe it!

13:28.930 --> 13:30.764
I gave him
a definite "no."

13:30.832 --> 13:31.864
I'm gonna kill him.

13:31.932 --> 13:33.065
<i>That's...</i>

13:33.133 --> 13:35.801
A pretty serious threat,
miracle girl.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.707
Excuse me.
Mm-HM.

13:43.944 --> 13:45.578
I don't know what
you're so upset about.

13:45.646 --> 13:47.513
<i>I thought I found a pretty
photogenic picture of you.</i>

13:47.580 --> 13:48.713
Had to touch it up a bit,
of course.

13:48.781 --> 13:49.915
Make you look good.

13:49.982 --> 13:51.282
Chase, who do you
think you are?

13:51.350 --> 13:52.884
Just because you stuck up
a little poster at Maggie's

13:52.952 --> 13:55.286
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen.

14:03.895 --> 14:04.895
I'm not doing it.

14:04.963 --> 14:07.998
This is where you can reach me.

14:08.934 --> 14:11.068
Keep the date open!

14:14.579 --> 14:15.879
<i>I want my mom
here, on Saturday,</i>

14:15.947 --> 14:17.313
<i>For her birthday,
for dinner.</i>

14:17.381 --> 14:19.616
I'm gonna cook,
and I think we should show her...

14:19.684 --> 14:21.017
Show her what?

14:21.953 --> 14:23.186
I just don't understand

14:23.253 --> 14:23.887
What you have to prove
to your mother?

14:23.955 --> 14:25.287
Nothing.

14:25.355 --> 14:28.390
I just think we should be
the better people.

14:28.458 --> 14:31.026
We are the better people.

14:31.094 --> 14:32.995
Come on, cowboy.

14:36.733 --> 14:38.567
It means a lot to me.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.235
Pretty please?

14:58.786 --> 14:59.853
Mrs. Bell...

15:01.155 --> 15:03.056
Yeah, he's doing fine.

15:04.325 --> 15:05.392
Pick you up?

15:07.361 --> 15:08.728
Oh, um...

15:09.663 --> 15:11.064
Yeah, sure.
Uh...

15:11.999 --> 15:13.799
I can do that.
Yeah. Um...

15:14.735 --> 15:16.636
I'll be right there.

15:16.703 --> 15:18.538
Okay. Bye.

15:20.173 --> 15:22.141
<i>So, I made the
mistake of telling my niece</i>

15:22.208 --> 15:23.509
<i>About my little adventure</i>

15:23.576 --> 15:26.245
And now she wants me to stop
using the pony cart.

15:26.312 --> 15:27.646
Well, maybe that's not
such a bad idea.

15:27.713 --> 15:30.549
Well, how else am I supposed
to get around?

15:30.616 --> 15:31.750
That cart's my freedom.

15:31.817 --> 15:33.485
I don't drive a car,
for heaven's sakes!

15:33.553 --> 15:35.187
It's too dangerous.
I know, but...

15:35.255 --> 15:36.421
And sugarfoot?

15:36.488 --> 15:38.256
Well, he'd miss it terribly.

15:38.323 --> 15:39.890
He practically runs in circles

15:39.958 --> 15:41.459
When I mention going out.

15:41.527 --> 15:43.094
<i>Did I ever tell you
about the time</i>

15:43.162 --> 15:45.163
<i>He found his own harness?</i>

15:45.230 --> 15:48.066
<i>I'd misplaced it,
and wouldn't you know</i>

15:48.133 --> 15:50.234
<i>The little devil
sniffed it out.</i>

15:54.105 --> 15:56.373
Well, how's it all going?

15:56.441 --> 15:59.977
Well, I'm basically rebuilding
this place from scratch

16:00.045 --> 16:03.447
And dad decides to kick back
in Vancouver for the week.

16:03.514 --> 16:05.583
So, it's pretty awesome.

16:06.517 --> 16:07.585
<i>Dammit!</i>

16:07.652 --> 16:08.751
Dammit!

16:08.819 --> 16:10.954
Are you all right?

16:11.021 --> 16:12.755
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

16:12.823 --> 16:14.323
Gee, I don't know, Lou.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.926
Maybe because you're here
in Hudson,

16:16.994 --> 16:18.127
Your husband's in Dubai

16:18.195 --> 16:19.462
And you're not taking
his calls.

16:19.529 --> 16:21.030
Could be a cause for concern.

16:21.098 --> 16:22.966
Peter and I are fine.

16:23.033 --> 16:24.200
We're fine.

16:24.267 --> 16:25.333
<i>I come home</i>

16:25.401 --> 16:26.501
And everything
I worked so hard at

16:26.569 --> 16:29.104
Has just been left to ruin.

16:29.171 --> 16:32.540
How can I leave
without fixing it, you know?

16:32.609 --> 16:34.375
Getting it back up
and running...?

16:34.443 --> 16:35.611
Why?

16:35.678 --> 16:37.012
Why? Why?

16:37.080 --> 16:39.347
Because it's wrong
to let something so good

16:39.415 --> 16:41.582
Just go to seed and die.

16:42.517 --> 16:43.818
Are you talking
about this place

16:43.885 --> 16:45.886
Or your marriage?

16:47.388 --> 16:48.923
I'm just asking.

16:49.858 --> 16:51.892
Lou?
No, you know what?

16:51.960 --> 16:54.161
Uh, Lou- no, if you're
not here to help,

16:54.229 --> 16:57.396
Why don't you just back off?

16:57.464 --> 16:59.198
Agh. My hoody!

17:02.603 --> 17:03.970
<i>Ty!</i>

17:04.839 --> 17:06.772
You are not gonna believe
what this guy did!

17:06.840 --> 17:08.473
What guy?
Chase.

17:08.541 --> 17:10.542
<i>Ty?</i>

17:10.611 --> 17:13.612
Is this a new cut
we didn't see yesterday?

17:13.680 --> 17:15.748
I'll get it.

17:18.451 --> 17:19.518
Hello?

17:21.788 --> 17:25.124
I'm sorry, from what paper?
About what?

17:26.626 --> 17:28.359
Yes.
Um, you know what?

17:28.426 --> 17:30.828
I'm gonna have to call you back
about that.

17:30.896 --> 17:32.596
Okay. Bye.

17:42.808 --> 17:44.208
Chase!

17:44.276 --> 17:45.542
If you thought I'd fall
for the reporter gag,

17:45.609 --> 17:47.277
You must think
I'm pretty stupid.

17:47.344 --> 17:48.645
No, you're not stupid.

17:48.713 --> 17:51.548
Intimidated? Maybe.
Stupid? No.

17:51.615 --> 17:52.549
Intimidated?

17:52.616 --> 17:54.184
By you?
That's funny.

17:54.251 --> 17:55.485
You're scared
you won't measure up.

17:55.553 --> 17:56.953
I get it.
It's fine.

17:58.489 --> 18:01.157
Okay, who won the ring of fire
contest here?

18:01.224 --> 18:02.792
Yeah, I'm not intimidated,
all right?

18:02.859 --> 18:03.926
I'm not scared.

18:05.195 --> 18:06.562
Whatever.

18:07.497 --> 18:09.699
I'm so gonna show you up!

18:11.134 --> 18:13.102
So, you're doing it?

18:15.806 --> 18:18.472
It's just one clinic.

18:18.540 --> 18:19.774
Amy, no!

18:21.443 --> 18:22.510
Listen to me.

18:22.578 --> 18:24.278
This guy is a complete jerk!

18:24.346 --> 18:26.147
Just call him back.

18:26.215 --> 18:27.315
Tell him you got
better things to do

18:27.382 --> 18:29.417
Than waste your time with him.

18:29.484 --> 18:32.620
Better yet,
tell him to his face.

18:36.357 --> 18:38.258
Hey!
There's the miracle girl now.

18:38.326 --> 18:39.727
Amy, I want you to meet
Barnie els.

18:39.794 --> 18:41.128
He owns this place.

18:41.196 --> 18:42.596
He's been selling
a whole lot of tickets,

18:42.663 --> 18:44.464
And he's one happy promoter
right now.

18:44.532 --> 18:45.799
Heard a lot about you,
young lady.

18:45.867 --> 18:47.034
Good to have you on board.

18:47.102 --> 18:48.401
Thank you.

18:48.469 --> 18:50.369
Chase, can I talk to you
for a second?

18:50.437 --> 18:51.771
Privately.

18:51.839 --> 18:52.905
Sure.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.011
I'm not doing it.

18:59.947 --> 19:01.480
You know, uh...

19:01.548 --> 19:02.982
I kinda saw that comin'.

19:03.050 --> 19:04.350
You did, did you?

19:04.417 --> 19:05.350
Predictable girl crap.

19:05.417 --> 19:06.918
Excuse me?

19:06.986 --> 19:08.620
You're afraid I'll show you up.

19:08.687 --> 19:09.821
No, I'm not.

19:09.889 --> 19:11.089
I just have better things to do

19:11.157 --> 19:12.323
Than watch you Chase
a horse around a ring

19:12.391 --> 19:14.092
Throwing beach balls at it.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.560
Come on, admit it.

19:15.628 --> 19:18.463
You got a little case
of the nerves.

19:18.530 --> 19:20.298
Chase, you're the one
with the big nerve here.

19:20.366 --> 19:22.299
Okay.

19:23.235 --> 19:25.002
You know what?
Fine. I'll do it.

19:25.070 --> 19:26.971
Just to wipe that smile
off your face.

19:29.407 --> 19:30.975
Your choice.

19:43.053 --> 19:45.354
Ty, are you even talking to me?

19:45.422 --> 19:46.956
Why wouldn't I be talking
to you?

19:47.024 --> 19:49.458
'cause you were awfully
quiet in the truck.

19:49.526 --> 19:50.994
I've just got a lot on my mind.

19:51.061 --> 19:54.296
Ty, I'll do this one clinic
and that will be that, okay?

19:54.363 --> 19:57.399
Come on. You look so stern
and serious.

19:58.334 --> 19:59.868
The guy is such an ass, Amy.

19:59.936 --> 20:00.969
Yeah, he is.

20:01.037 --> 20:02.171
You let him bully you
into this.

20:02.238 --> 20:03.538
I didn't let him bully me,
okay?

20:03.606 --> 20:05.908
He just made me feel
like I was afraid.

20:05.975 --> 20:07.176
You're not afraid.

20:07.243 --> 20:08.277
You let him push your buttons.

20:08.344 --> 20:11.679
Okay, I did.
I'm an idiot.

20:11.746 --> 20:13.614
Let's not talk
about this, okay?

20:13.682 --> 20:15.382
Ty, what's on your mind?

20:16.451 --> 20:17.852
<i>So the fee increased
by how much?</i>

20:20.289 --> 20:21.923
Even working two jobs,
I barely have enough saved

20:21.990 --> 20:24.091
For tuition and books.

20:24.159 --> 20:25.926
And look at the cost
of second, third,

20:25.993 --> 20:28.061
And fourth year.

20:29.030 --> 20:30.530
And then I got this
crazy schedule.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.232
<i>I don't see how I can work</i>

20:32.300 --> 20:33.499
<i>And go to school
at the same time.</i>

20:33.567 --> 20:34.968
<i>And if I can't,</i>

20:35.036 --> 20:36.303
<i>There's no way I'm gonna
have money for tuition.</i>

20:36.370 --> 20:37.737
Yeah, well, just go one step
at a time. Right?

20:37.805 --> 20:39.306
Yeah, well, just go one step
at a time. Right?

20:39.373 --> 20:41.340
You've got enough for this year.
Barely.

20:41.407 --> 20:44.509
And, who knows,
maybe I can help you out.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.079
I mean,
if these clinics take off...

20:47.147 --> 20:48.914
My clinics, I mean.

20:48.982 --> 20:50.950
Amy, I would never
ask you to do that.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.651
Why not?
We're together.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.119
We're a couple, right?

20:54.187 --> 20:56.021
Come on.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.822
<i>Hmm?</i>

20:59.925 --> 21:01.326
Sorry to interrupt.

21:01.393 --> 21:03.794
I think sugarfoot needs
a new bandage.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.064
Little devil ate the old one.

21:08.633 --> 21:09.700
Okay.

21:16.274 --> 21:17.341
Ashley.

21:18.843 --> 21:19.943
Hi.

21:20.011 --> 21:22.212
I got your text.
What's up?

21:22.280 --> 21:24.781
Well, I wanted to ask you
to have dinner

21:24.849 --> 21:27.050
With Caleb and I
on Saturday night.

21:27.118 --> 21:28.252
Saturday.

21:28.319 --> 21:30.253
Yeah.
It's your birthday.

21:34.224 --> 21:37.894
I've already made plans
with friends.

21:39.062 --> 21:41.530
I mean, I could cancel,
I guess.

21:41.598 --> 21:43.199
No. No.
I mean...

21:43.267 --> 21:44.867
We can just do it
some other time.

21:44.934 --> 21:47.769
Obviously friends
are important and, uh...

21:47.836 --> 21:49.771
You already have plans, so...

21:49.838 --> 21:51.873
Later. No problem.

21:51.941 --> 21:55.610
Hi. I'll be with you
in just a minute.

21:55.677 --> 21:58.846
Okay... Well,
thank you for the invite.

21:58.915 --> 22:01.115
And we'll do a rain check,
right?

22:08.790 --> 22:10.190
Get this,

22:10.258 --> 22:11.591
Get this,

22:11.659 --> 22:14.261
My niece ratted me out
to my sister in Florida.

22:14.329 --> 22:16.130
Really?

22:16.197 --> 22:17.397
So my sister called me up

22:17.464 --> 22:19.065
Saying that I should
move down there

22:19.133 --> 22:20.266
To live with her.

22:20.334 --> 22:21.734
She says she's lonely,

22:21.802 --> 22:23.269
But I know she really
just thinks

22:23.337 --> 22:24.870
I can't take care of myself.

22:24.939 --> 22:27.240
I have no intention
of moving to Florida.

22:27.308 --> 22:28.574
I've got enough tucked away

22:28.642 --> 22:31.744
That I am perfectly fine
living on my own.

22:31.812 --> 22:33.645
I got money tucked away
for him, too.

22:34.580 --> 22:35.780
Him?

22:35.848 --> 22:37.049
Him.

22:37.116 --> 22:39.084
Yeah.
If I kick the bucket,

22:39.152 --> 22:42.120
There's enough money
to keep sugarfoot in comfort

22:42.188 --> 22:44.756
The rest of his days.

22:44.824 --> 22:46.691
Here, can you hold him for a second?
Okay.

22:46.759 --> 22:48.693
<i>I know you got all that
schooling ahead of you.</i>

22:48.761 --> 22:51.362
<i>It's not an easy road,
but you stick to it.</i>

22:51.430 --> 22:54.098
You're gonna make a good vet.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.799
Thanks.

22:55.867 --> 22:56.968
I actually really needed
to hear that

22:57.035 --> 22:58.502
Right about now.

22:58.570 --> 23:00.004
Why?

23:00.072 --> 23:02.473
Ah... Well, I'm struggling
a bit to get there.

23:02.540 --> 23:04.141
You know, money...

23:04.209 --> 23:05.475
The old story.

23:05.542 --> 23:06.843
Hm.
Isn't it always?

23:07.778 --> 23:09.946
You got family to help?

23:10.014 --> 23:12.315
<i>Oh, course you don't.</i>

23:12.383 --> 23:14.851
I heard that sordid tale
from Lou.

23:15.786 --> 23:18.488
Did you ever know
your grandparents?

23:18.555 --> 23:20.457
Uh... No.
I never did.

23:22.459 --> 23:24.159
Oh, I never had kids.

23:24.227 --> 23:26.895
Maybe I could be
your honorary grandma?

23:28.865 --> 23:30.632
Sounds good to me.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.502
Okay, boy.

23:33.569 --> 23:36.105
Come on in here.
Let's go.

23:40.732 --> 23:43.634
<i>Well, Jack, I mean sometimes
I can be such an idiot.</i>

23:43.702 --> 23:46.002
I mean, Ashley took
a big step today.

23:46.070 --> 23:47.503
Asked me to come
for a birthday dinner

23:47.571 --> 23:48.938
And instead of saying,
"how nice,

23:49.005 --> 23:50.272
I'd love to come,"

23:50.341 --> 23:52.141
I told her
I'd already made plans.

23:52.209 --> 23:55.812
Well, I know,
I have with you and Lisa.

23:55.879 --> 23:57.413
Look, val,

23:57.481 --> 24:00.182
Lisa and I are just fine
with you cancelling our drink

24:00.250 --> 24:01.183
At the polo club.

24:01.251 --> 24:02.518
I knew you would be.

24:02.586 --> 24:05.654
No, it's just that
it's late notice.

24:05.722 --> 24:06.855
So, anyway,
if you wouldn't mind,

24:06.922 --> 24:08.289
Maybe we could do it
another time, huh?

24:08.358 --> 24:10.892
Well, we don't mind.
Not a bit.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.494
Good.

24:12.562 --> 24:13.762
Look at it this way, Jack.

24:13.830 --> 24:15.430
You won't have to put on
your good suit.

24:15.498 --> 24:17.399
Yeah.

24:18.768 --> 24:21.535
And Lisa won't have
to put on her good face.

24:21.603 --> 24:23.704
Uh...
Just phone your daughter

24:23.772 --> 24:26.374
And let her know
you've changed your plans.

24:26.441 --> 24:28.008
Happy Birthday, val.

24:30.445 --> 24:32.279
So she can't come.
Big deal.

24:32.347 --> 24:33.581
We'll do it again
another night.

24:33.648 --> 24:35.182
Another night
isn't her birthday.

24:35.250 --> 24:37.049
It's just another night.

24:37.117 --> 24:39.185
I guess I don't see
what the big deal is.

24:39.253 --> 24:40.820
The big deal is that
she made plans with friends

24:40.888 --> 24:42.489
Without even considering
that her daughter

24:42.556 --> 24:43.690
Might wanna do something
with her.

24:43.758 --> 24:45.324
Yeah, well?

24:45.393 --> 24:47.226
You didn't ask her until today,
did ya?

24:47.294 --> 24:49.796
She's shut me out again.

24:49.864 --> 24:52.163
Come on, Ash.
Don't do this.

24:52.231 --> 24:53.365
I just want things

24:53.433 --> 24:55.100
To go back
to the way they were.

25:05.011 --> 25:06.077
Hi, mom!

25:08.146 --> 25:09.414
Really?

25:10.348 --> 25:12.016
That's fantastic.

25:12.951 --> 25:14.184
I'll see you tomorrow.

25:14.252 --> 25:16.186
Okay. Bye.

25:16.254 --> 25:18.255
She's coming!

25:18.323 --> 25:19.724
Oh, I'm gonna make
all her favourite things.

25:19.792 --> 25:21.191
And we need to clean up
the porch,

25:21.259 --> 25:23.394
And you need to get rid
of that horrible couch.

25:23.461 --> 25:24.861
Oh, this is gonna be good.
We're gonna eat outside.

25:24.929 --> 25:26.329
Oh, I can't wait!

25:28.466 --> 25:29.933
So in the end,
we're off the hook?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.200
She's having
her birthday dinner

25:31.268 --> 25:32.402
With her daughter?

25:32.470 --> 25:33.804
You owe me big.

25:34.739 --> 25:36.440
Well, maybe I do.

25:36.507 --> 25:40.342
<i>How about an evening
on our own instead?</i>

25:40.410 --> 25:41.710
You know, isn't that funny
about val.

25:41.778 --> 25:43.913
She's just pushing away
the very person

25:43.980 --> 25:46.449
<i>That she needs to communicate
with the most.</i>

25:46.516 --> 25:48.283
Human nature's funny, isn't it?

25:48.351 --> 25:49.685
I gotta wash my hair.

25:52.021 --> 25:53.456
<i>Hello?</i>

25:53.523 --> 25:54.890
<i>Peter!
Yeah...</i>

25:55.825 --> 25:57.625
<i>Yeah, hold on.</i>

25:57.693 --> 26:00.495
<i>Uh... Uh, no...</i>

26:00.563 --> 26:01.963
No, she's out.

26:02.898 --> 26:03.965
<i>Again.</i>

26:05.067 --> 26:06.133
Yeah.

26:06.201 --> 26:08.369
Okay, I'll tell her you called.

26:08.437 --> 26:09.370
<i>See ya.</i>

26:13.407 --> 26:14.475
Hey.

26:16.277 --> 26:17.444
You all right?

26:17.512 --> 26:18.979
If another person asks me that,

26:19.046 --> 26:20.447
I am going to scream.

26:20.515 --> 26:23.149
Lou, you just blew off
another call from Peter.

26:23.217 --> 26:25.385
What was that about?
Nothing.

26:25.453 --> 26:26.987
<i>Why didn't you talk to him?
What's going on?</i>

26:27.054 --> 26:28.754
Look, if I knew
what was going on,

26:28.822 --> 26:30.756
I would tell him.

26:30.824 --> 26:32.959
Lou, you do know
what's going on.

26:33.026 --> 26:34.126
You don't wanna go back
to Dubai

26:34.194 --> 26:36.496
'cause you don't like it there.

26:36.563 --> 26:39.098
It's not just that.
I...

26:39.165 --> 26:40.733
It's complicated.

26:40.801 --> 26:42.869
You're impossible.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.707
I just think we need
to give Lou

26:48.774 --> 26:50.274
A little bit of guidance.

26:50.342 --> 26:53.011
And I'm not sure
that's our place.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.514
Well, you know what it is?

26:55.581 --> 26:56.748
It's the dude ranch.

26:56.816 --> 26:57.983
That's why she's not
taking Peter's calls.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.050
Because she's afraid
to tell him

26:59.118 --> 27:00.751
That she has to stay longer

27:00.819 --> 27:02.219
To fix them up
and get them running.

27:02.286 --> 27:04.054
They'll work it out.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.355
You know what?
She's gonna ruin her marriage,

27:05.423 --> 27:07.157
If she doesn't watch it.

27:07.225 --> 27:08.659
And Tim... Ugh!

27:08.727 --> 27:10.060
He's just...
He's useless.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.963
All he can think about
is his little 90 pound bundle

27:13.031 --> 27:14.097
Of true grit.

27:14.165 --> 27:17.767
Oh, Janice?
No, let's not go there.

27:21.739 --> 27:23.673
I think I know how I can help.

27:30.915 --> 27:33.081
<i>Get up.
Come on, get up.</i>

27:37.286 --> 27:39.021
Jet's owners brought him
here today

27:39.088 --> 27:40.622
'cause he's been
a little bit edgy

27:40.690 --> 27:42.357
And unpredictable.

27:42.425 --> 27:43.391
Sometimes even aggressive.

27:45.494 --> 27:46.562
Come on!

27:55.303 --> 27:57.071
<i>Look at that, folks?
Licking and chewing.</i>

27:57.138 --> 27:58.338
Either this horse
wants to join up,

27:58.406 --> 27:59.640
Or he's been eating
peanut butter.

28:07.414 --> 28:08.481
Good...

28:10.517 --> 28:12.418
<i>There you have it, the
famous Amy Fleming join up.</i>

28:16.958 --> 28:19.525
Got him eating out of her hand.

28:23.529 --> 28:25.130
Okay.

28:25.198 --> 28:27.032
Now the real work begins.

28:30.536 --> 28:32.071
<i>Now, Amy and I may be partners,</i>

28:32.138 --> 28:34.073
But that doesn't mean
she agrees with all my methods.

28:34.140 --> 28:35.840
Actually, I don't agree
with any of his methods.

28:37.509 --> 28:38.977
Nice.

28:39.044 --> 28:42.013
But a trustworthy horse
is a desensitized horse.

28:42.081 --> 28:43.815
<i>You can't have an animal
that spooks at everything.</i>

28:43.882 --> 28:45.583
He's gotta know who's boss.

28:45.651 --> 28:46.951
Okay, well, I don't get that

28:47.019 --> 28:48.786
'cause I don't want
a boss/servant relationship

28:48.854 --> 28:50.054
With a horse.

28:50.122 --> 28:52.188
I want a partnership
that's based on trust.

28:52.256 --> 28:53.724
He trusts me.

28:53.791 --> 28:56.259
If he didn't,
he wouldn't let me do this.

29:03.467 --> 29:05.068
Nice hair.

29:17.213 --> 29:18.681
You see that?

29:18.749 --> 29:19.915
<i>He was trying to show me,</i>

29:19.983 --> 29:22.551
<i>But I showed him instead.</i>

29:22.619 --> 29:24.986
Any behaviour like that,
you gotta nip it in the bud.

29:25.054 --> 29:26.921
'cause if you don't,
it's only gonna get worse.

29:26.989 --> 29:28.623
If you have a thousand pound
poodle running at you,

29:28.691 --> 29:29.824
<i>You've got a problem.</i>

29:34.664 --> 29:35.730
Chase?

29:36.966 --> 29:38.099
Look, he only did that

29:38.167 --> 29:39.767
Because of the damn
leaf blower, okay?

29:39.834 --> 29:41.234
So, I'm not gonna be
involved in this

29:41.302 --> 29:43.871
If you're doing
some sideshow here.

29:43.938 --> 29:45.739
It's not a sideshow.

29:45.807 --> 29:48.909
I believe in what I do,
just like you.

29:52.047 --> 29:53.714
Hey.

29:53.782 --> 29:55.649
Thought we were going
to Amy's clinic?

29:55.716 --> 29:56.816
Hey!

29:56.884 --> 29:57.850
I'm baking a cake.

29:57.918 --> 29:59.552
You've tried like three times.

29:59.619 --> 30:01.120
Why don't I just go into town
and buy a damn cake.

30:01.188 --> 30:03.022
Because this one
is gonna work, okay?!

30:03.090 --> 30:04.523
Relax.
You know, it's just a cake.

30:04.591 --> 30:05.958
It's important to me.

30:06.026 --> 30:07.526
Why?

30:07.594 --> 30:08.861
Okay.

30:08.929 --> 30:10.830
Don't laugh.
But...

30:10.898 --> 30:13.431
When I was little,
I had a playhouse,

30:13.499 --> 30:14.966
And there was a kitchen
with a real sink

30:15.034 --> 30:16.367
And a fridge and an oven...

30:16.435 --> 30:18.236
An easy bake oven.

30:19.172 --> 30:21.406
And then one year,
for my mom's birthday,

30:21.473 --> 30:23.374
I baked her a cake...

30:23.442 --> 30:27.212
And my mom and my dad sat
at this miniature table

30:27.279 --> 30:28.813
With these crazy little chairs

30:28.880 --> 30:30.081
And ate it.

30:30.148 --> 30:32.116
I'm sure it tasted horrible,

30:32.184 --> 30:34.518
But she said it was the...

30:34.586 --> 30:38.288
Best thing she'd ever eaten.

30:38.356 --> 30:41.525
I've never seen her
more happy and...

30:41.593 --> 30:43.160
You know, proud.

30:44.095 --> 30:46.262
In your miniature playhouse?

30:49.200 --> 30:50.867
<i>Awww!</i>

31:02.278 --> 31:03.879
<i>He's still testing me.</i>

31:03.947 --> 31:07.015
But if he's gonna do that,
I'm gonna keep up the pressure.

31:08.851 --> 31:11.085
<i>Soon as he settles down,
I'll release the pressure.</i>

31:17.059 --> 31:19.127
It's advance and retreat.

31:19.194 --> 31:20.762
<i>The secret to gentling a horse</i>

31:20.829 --> 31:21.996
Is to make
the good behaviours easy

31:22.064 --> 31:24.430
And the bad behaviours
difficult.

31:24.498 --> 31:27.400
Well, I hate to admit it,
but I do agree with that.

31:27.468 --> 31:28.434
<i>You're kidding!</i>

31:28.502 --> 31:29.502
Well, that's a first.

31:31.005 --> 31:33.106
<i>You're my witness, folks.</i>

31:58.430 --> 32:00.331
Come on, jet.
Come on.

32:35.933 --> 32:38.868
That was totally awesome!

32:38.936 --> 32:40.303
Just amazing!

32:40.370 --> 32:41.637
You were really good.

32:41.705 --> 32:42.905
This horse is incredible!
I love him.

32:42.973 --> 32:44.206
He was just totally different,
by the end.

32:44.273 --> 32:45.506
You see?
Aren't you glad you did it?

32:45.574 --> 32:46.507
Yes!

32:46.575 --> 32:47.809
Yes, I am.
That was a...

32:47.877 --> 32:49.311
You have to admit,
we're really good together.

32:49.378 --> 32:51.279
Yes! Yes, we are.

32:57.220 --> 32:59.287
Chase...

33:09.143 --> 33:11.746
How do you like your steak?

33:11.813 --> 33:13.180
It's good.

33:13.248 --> 33:16.182
Well done,
just the way I like it.

33:16.250 --> 33:18.618
Caleb is great
with the barbecue.

33:18.686 --> 33:19.919
You know, actually,

33:19.987 --> 33:21.954
I don't eat that much meat
anymore.

33:22.022 --> 33:23.956
Oh. Are you done?

33:24.024 --> 33:25.458
Thank you.

33:25.526 --> 33:26.826
It was lovely.

33:26.894 --> 33:28.395
You know, when
the weather is nice,

33:28.462 --> 33:31.430
Um, this porch is kinda like
a second living room.

33:31.498 --> 33:32.531
It's so cramped in there.

33:32.599 --> 33:33.632
We're like on top of each other

33:33.700 --> 33:34.767
All the time.

33:35.968 --> 33:38.604
Uh, Ms. Stanton...
Uh... Val,

33:39.539 --> 33:41.106
<i>I'd just like to take
this opportunity</i>

33:41.173 --> 33:45.343
To tell you how much
I do love your daughter.

33:45.412 --> 33:47.845
And I hope I haven't done
anything to damage

33:47.913 --> 33:50.347
The great relationship
you have with her.

33:53.452 --> 33:54.652
Oh, Caleb,

33:55.487 --> 33:57.388
You couldn't possibly
do anything

33:57.456 --> 33:59.924
To damage my relationship
with my daughter.

33:59.991 --> 34:01.258
Nothing at all.

34:01.326 --> 34:02.893
Except maybe give her a ring

34:02.960 --> 34:04.961
That probably came out
of a crackerjack box.

34:05.029 --> 34:06.296
Has it turned green yet?

34:12.202 --> 34:13.870
Mom, um...

34:13.938 --> 34:15.839
Close your eyes.

34:22.712 --> 34:23.679
Happy Birthday!

34:23.746 --> 34:25.547
Happy Birthday.

34:27.484 --> 34:29.618
Well, look at that.

34:31.020 --> 34:33.388
Ashley, did you make this?

34:33.456 --> 34:35.022
Make a wish.

34:36.725 --> 34:38.525
Don't tempt me.

34:46.936 --> 34:48.302
<i>So...</i>

34:48.370 --> 34:52.172
Ashley was telling me
about her playhouse.

34:52.239 --> 34:54.407
Do you remember it?

34:54.476 --> 34:56.342
'course I remember it.

34:56.409 --> 34:59.613
You wanted to live in it.

34:59.681 --> 35:03.149
And you had that...
That little easy bake oven.

35:03.217 --> 35:05.151
Do you remember that?

35:05.219 --> 35:06.353
Yeah.

35:12.593 --> 35:14.594
Hey.
Do you have a minute?

35:14.661 --> 35:15.728
Yeah.

35:18.732 --> 35:19.932
Okay.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.066
Do you want to know why

35:21.134 --> 35:23.234
I haven't been
taking Peter's calls?

35:23.302 --> 35:25.737
Because I just tried
to phone him right now

35:25.805 --> 35:27.171
And I couldn't.

35:27.239 --> 35:28.673
Because I realized that...

35:28.741 --> 35:31.743
I mean, he's not gonna believe
that I don't wanna go back

35:31.811 --> 35:33.177
Because I hate Dubai.

35:33.245 --> 35:35.446
He's gonna think that
I don't love him anymore.

35:35.515 --> 35:36.748
And that is completely
my fault.

35:36.816 --> 35:40.217
'cause I knew
what I was signing up for.

35:40.284 --> 35:41.485
And you're not even
listening to me.

35:41.553 --> 35:44.588
Amy, I'm spilling my guts here!

35:44.656 --> 35:46.456
Hey, what is the matter?

35:46.525 --> 35:47.691
Everything.

35:48.627 --> 35:49.927
Everything?

35:49.995 --> 35:51.194
Now who's impossible?

35:54.098 --> 35:55.164
Chase.

35:55.232 --> 35:56.432
What did he do?

35:56.500 --> 35:58.467
He kissed me.

35:58.536 --> 35:59.836
He kissed you?

35:59.904 --> 36:02.204
He really kissed you?

36:02.272 --> 36:04.541
He knows you're with Ty.
What a complete...

36:04.608 --> 36:07.010
I kissed him too, Lou.

36:08.012 --> 36:09.812
It just happened.
I don't why.

36:09.880 --> 36:11.747
I don't wanna be with Chase.

36:11.814 --> 36:13.015
Of course you don't.

36:13.082 --> 36:15.350
I love Ty.
Of course you do.

36:15.418 --> 36:17.986
I don't know what to do.

36:20.456 --> 36:21.690
Lou, should I tell Ty?

36:21.758 --> 36:23.358
No. Don't.

36:23.426 --> 36:25.293
That will just cause problems.

36:25.361 --> 36:27.261
Untold problems.

36:28.363 --> 36:29.530
Are you sure?

36:29.598 --> 36:32.667
Look, what Ty doesn't know
won't hurt him.

36:32.734 --> 36:35.670
And you just have
to let this go.

36:35.737 --> 36:38.338
I don't think I can do that.

36:38.406 --> 36:39.974
Okay.
Well, sleep on it.

36:40.042 --> 36:41.341
Okay, Amy?

36:41.409 --> 36:42.876
Promise me.

36:47.514 --> 36:48.582
So, I found a course

36:48.649 --> 36:51.017
That's based in
more practical work.

36:51.085 --> 36:53.053
Ty...
So, it even counts as a credit,

36:53.120 --> 36:54.253
I'll definitely have
more time...

36:54.321 --> 36:55.589
There's something
I gotta tell you...

36:55.656 --> 36:58.224
And I can work with Scott-
Ty, Chase kissed me.

36:59.158 --> 37:00.225
What?

37:01.995 --> 37:03.896
Chase kissed me.

37:06.833 --> 37:09.201
Why?
It just sorta happened.

37:10.136 --> 37:13.138
Nothing just happens, Amy.

37:13.206 --> 37:14.206
I'm gonna kill that guy.

37:14.273 --> 37:16.240
No. It was me too,
okay?

37:17.175 --> 37:19.077
I kissed him back.

37:19.144 --> 37:21.345
I'm so sorry.
It doesn't change anything.

37:21.413 --> 37:24.681
I still love you.
It doesn't change anything?

37:24.749 --> 37:26.316
Are you kidding me?

37:27.284 --> 37:28.318
Ty...

37:29.487 --> 37:30.988
I just...

37:31.055 --> 37:33.123
I had to tell you.

37:34.626 --> 37:36.693
I know you'd tell me
if anything ever happened

37:36.761 --> 37:39.528
With you and another girl.

37:39.596 --> 37:40.630
I just...

37:44.001 --> 37:46.736
Ty, you would tell me, right?

37:46.803 --> 37:48.638
I'd wanna know.

37:50.306 --> 37:52.642
I'm glad you told me,

37:54.677 --> 37:55.810
But I'm still gonna kill him.

37:55.878 --> 37:57.846
Ty, don't do anything, okay?

37:57.913 --> 38:00.314
This is just as much my fault
as it is his.

38:00.382 --> 38:02.183
This is just as much my fault
as it is his.

38:02.251 --> 38:05.219
Don't be mad at him,
be mad at me.

38:06.155 --> 38:07.321
We were just...

38:07.389 --> 38:08.489
We were up on this kind of high

38:08.557 --> 38:10.323
After the show and...

38:10.391 --> 38:14.628
It didn't mean anything.
I love you so much.

38:16.297 --> 38:18.766
I'm so sorry.
Please...

38:21.569 --> 38:23.236
I'm so sorry.

38:26.439 --> 38:27.506
Please...

38:29.977 --> 38:32.945
There!
It's starting to look better already.

38:33.013 --> 38:34.513
Yeah.

38:34.581 --> 38:36.082
I can certainly see
why you're reluctant

38:36.150 --> 38:38.617
To walk away from this place.

38:40.087 --> 38:42.487
I ever tell you
about my marriage?

38:42.555 --> 38:43.889
No. Uh, but...

38:43.956 --> 38:45.323
Dan.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.625
Dan and I got married
in a total whirlwind,

38:47.694 --> 38:49.194
Just like you two.

38:49.261 --> 38:51.362
Left Fairfield,
went down to the States.

38:51.430 --> 38:54.532
Midwest.
Oh my God, I missed home.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.768
Anyway, at one point,
my dad got ill

38:56.836 --> 38:58.836
And I had to come back.

38:58.904 --> 39:00.337
And then, sadly, he died

39:00.405 --> 39:03.074
<i>And, um, I had to make
a decision.</i>

39:03.141 --> 39:05.509
To sell Fairfield
and go back to the States,

39:05.577 --> 39:07.878
<i>To my marriage,
or...</i>

39:07.946 --> 39:09.513
<i>Not.</i>

39:09.581 --> 39:11.782
And I remember I was sitting,
drinking my morning coffee,

39:11.850 --> 39:13.217
And I had this realization

39:13.284 --> 39:16.052
That I had really been
missing Fairfield

39:16.120 --> 39:18.421
More than I was missing Dan.

39:19.556 --> 39:21.390
<i>It felt horrible.
You know, I mean...</i>

39:21.458 --> 39:24.828
It just suddenly hit me,
I don't miss him.

39:24.895 --> 39:26.295
<i>But, you see with you,
Lou,</i>

39:26.363 --> 39:27.764
<i>It's totally different.</i>

39:27.832 --> 39:29.565
<i>I mean, you really do
miss Peter.</i>

39:29.633 --> 39:31.399
<i>Terribly.</i>

39:31.467 --> 39:32.534
I do.

39:32.602 --> 39:34.536
I miss him so much,
all the time.

39:34.604 --> 39:35.604
Well then, honey,

39:35.671 --> 39:37.505
Why are you not
taking his calls?

39:37.573 --> 39:39.908
Because-
I'm gonna tell you why.

39:39.976 --> 39:41.844
It's because of this damn
dude ranch...

39:41.911 --> 39:43.812
That's what's keeping
you here, right?

39:43.880 --> 39:45.013
You can't stop worrying
about it

39:45.081 --> 39:46.413
Until it's fixed,

39:46.481 --> 39:49.416
And then you can go back
to Dubai where you belong.

39:49.484 --> 39:51.853
I think I have a bit solution.

39:57.726 --> 39:59.493
Ugh. What kind of muffins
did you want?

39:59.561 --> 40:00.862
Oatmeal banana.

40:00.929 --> 40:02.462
They're his favourite treat.

40:02.529 --> 40:05.465
Now, make it a dozen,
and day old is fine.

40:05.532 --> 40:06.532
Oatmeal banana.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.001
What will he do without me?

40:08.069 --> 40:10.871
What's he gonna do
without his oatmeal muffins?

40:10.938 --> 40:13.039
Mrs. Bell,
if anything happens to you,

40:13.107 --> 40:15.976
I promise I'll look after
sugarfoot.

40:16.043 --> 40:17.177
That's him.

40:17.245 --> 40:19.078
<i>That's the truck.</i>

40:19.146 --> 40:21.046
That's the truck
that spooked sugarfoot.

40:30.757 --> 40:33.192
Well, hey, friend,
how can I help you?

40:33.260 --> 40:34.793
That's for running Mrs. Bell
off the road.

40:34.860 --> 40:36.227
Are you crazy?
What're you talking about?

40:39.598 --> 40:41.766
And that's for going after
my girlfriend!

40:41.834 --> 40:43.067
Yes!

40:43.135 --> 40:45.469
I'll get you those muffins.

40:51.877 --> 40:53.344
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

40:54.280 --> 40:55.280
Hi!

40:55.347 --> 40:56.647
Hi.

40:56.715 --> 40:58.082
So...

40:58.150 --> 41:01.151
Lou and I have a little bit
of a plan.

41:01.219 --> 41:05.088
<i>Lisa has offered to
buy the dude ranch...</i>

41:05.156 --> 41:06.523
And I accepted.

41:06.590 --> 41:07.825
<i>It may seem a little shocking,</i>

41:07.892 --> 41:10.294
<i>But, um...
I think it's a good idea.</i>

41:10.361 --> 41:11.929
Yeah... It is.

41:11.996 --> 41:13.230
<i>I mean, we'll check with Tim</i>

41:13.298 --> 41:14.664
<i>When he comes back
from Vancouver,</i>

41:14.732 --> 41:16.433
But I can't see any reason
why he wouldn't agree.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.434
It's the best way to go.

41:18.501 --> 41:20.369
Then that frees Lou up
to go back to Dubai,

41:20.437 --> 41:22.138
Back to Peter.

41:22.206 --> 41:24.040
It's kind of win-win.

41:24.107 --> 41:26.809
Well, that is some news.

41:26.877 --> 41:28.144
It's good.
Right, grampa?

41:36.986 --> 41:39.654
There you go, boy.
You all ready to go?

41:39.722 --> 41:41.223
Oh, he's ready all right.

41:41.290 --> 41:44.826
He told me he couldn't wait
to get outta here.

41:44.894 --> 41:46.194
Now, before we go,

41:46.262 --> 41:49.629
You and I have
some unfinished business.

41:49.697 --> 41:51.665
You can call me nosy,

41:51.733 --> 41:54.668
But I've been watching
and listening,

41:54.736 --> 41:57.537
And I know you have school
money problems;

41:57.605 --> 41:59.240
I want to help you solve them.

41:59.307 --> 42:00.674
Mrs. Bell, I don't want you
to think that I'm...

42:00.742 --> 42:03.244
No, you are a wonderful
young man

42:03.311 --> 42:05.945
With a promising future.

42:06.013 --> 42:08.414
I like people
who talk straight,

42:08.482 --> 42:09.916
But aren't afraid
to use their fists

42:09.984 --> 42:13.319
When the straight talking
doesn't quite do the trick.

42:13.387 --> 42:15.654
As your honorary grandma,

42:16.590 --> 42:19.292
I would be proud to pay
for your education.

42:19.360 --> 42:21.860
There's no point
socking it all away.

42:21.928 --> 42:24.263
Mrs. Bell, I can't-
yes. Oh yes, you can.

42:24.330 --> 42:25.463
Now don't worry.

42:25.531 --> 42:28.967
There'll be plenty left
for sugarfoot.

42:29.035 --> 42:32.737
And speaking of which,
there is a catch.

42:32.805 --> 42:34.907
I'll hold up my end
of the bargain

42:34.974 --> 42:38.042
If you promise to visit
every week

42:38.110 --> 42:40.144
And bring us those muffins.

42:41.914 --> 42:43.114
Of course!

42:43.181 --> 42:45.082
Okay.

42:48.220 --> 42:49.853
<i>You should have put
ice on this right away.</i>

42:49.922 --> 42:51.655
Like right after
that horse kicked you.

42:51.723 --> 42:53.156
Naw, it's just a small bruise.

42:53.224 --> 42:55.292
It's all part of the job.

42:55.359 --> 42:57.127
Clinic sounds so dangerous.

42:57.194 --> 43:00.063
I can't believe Amy decided
to be part of it.

43:00.131 --> 43:02.032
Amy was awesome.

43:03.534 --> 43:06.436
I'm not sure we'll be working
together again though.

43:06.503 --> 43:09.604
We've got pretty
different styles.

43:09.672 --> 43:12.474
Hmm, that's feeling
awfully good.

43:13.843 --> 43:14.910
Much better.

43:16.512 --> 43:18.280
I might have to come back later
for some more ice,

43:18.348 --> 43:19.848
If that's okay with you?

43:19.916 --> 43:21.550
Yeah.

43:21.617 --> 43:25.219
♪ let's try to work things out ♪

43:25.287 --> 43:28.722
♪ before we let it fall ♪

43:30.426 --> 43:33.161
♪ I just get so scared ♪

43:34.096 --> 43:38.699
♪ I'm going to lose it all... ♪

43:38.767 --> 43:40.001
Sugarfoot back at home
with his mom

43:40.069 --> 43:41.734
Where he belongs?

43:41.802 --> 43:43.437
Yeah, he is.

43:46.941 --> 43:48.708
I'm right where I belong too,
right?

43:50.310 --> 43:51.377
Absolutely.

43:52.546 --> 43:53.613
You sure?

43:56.216 --> 43:59.652
It's gonna take some time,
uh... You know, I....

43:59.720 --> 44:01.320
I know, Ty.
Please...

44:01.388 --> 44:02.889
Just say we're okay.

44:04.624 --> 44:05.891
We're okay.

44:06.993 --> 44:08.059
All right.

44:10.563 --> 44:12.297
You know, we should...

44:12.365 --> 44:13.799
Probably take a look
at those courses

44:13.867 --> 44:15.100
And figure something out.

44:15.969 --> 44:17.369
I've got some news, actually.

44:17.436 --> 44:19.037
- Yeah?
- It's kind've amazing.

44:19.105 --> 44:20.405
What?

44:20.473 --> 44:22.239
Well, it's like Mrs. Bell
always says,

44:22.307 --> 44:23.741
"you never know what's around
the corner."

44:23.809 --> 44:24.742
Well, tell me.

44:24.810 --> 44:25.977
I will.

44:26.044 --> 44:28.613
Now! Ty, tell me now!

44:28.680 --> 44:30.681
<i>What happened
to your knuckles?</i>
