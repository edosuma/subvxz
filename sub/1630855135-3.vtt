24:52.408 --> 24:57.871
<i>♪ I just want to start a flame ♪</i>

24:57.871 --> 25:00.874
JAN: I need to speak to you.
MAN: Who is he?

25:00.874 --> 25:03.377
WILLEM: Can, can we
have a minute, please?

25:03.377 --> 25:05.212
Just.

25:05.212 --> 25:11.760
<i>♪ In my heart,
I have but one desire ♪</i>

25:13.345 --> 25:14.638
WILLEM: I heard you got it.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.016
JAN: Papers!
A packet of papers!

25:17.016 --> 25:18.851
Why the hell
didn't you tell me?

25:18.851 --> 25:21.103
WILLEM: You might have
hesitated, we didn't have time.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.355
JAN: Hesitated?
You damn right I hesitated.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.606
What if I'd panicked?

25:24.606 --> 25:26.900
What if, what if
I'd left it there?

25:26.900 --> 25:28.902
WILLEM: Then you'd
be a monster.

25:28.902 --> 25:32.740
And I'd be bad at reading
people, which I am not.

25:32.740 --> 25:36.410
JAN: That's great.
That, that's fantastic.

25:37.995 --> 25:40.748
Oh my God.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.000
Sorry.

25:47.046 --> 25:50.549
So who was the
girl in the park?

25:50.549 --> 25:52.217
WILLEM: Does it matter?

25:52.217 --> 25:55.012
They're people.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.807
Really grateful people.

26:00.058 --> 26:02.978
I'm grateful, too.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.651
On here is the address
of a student at the

26:09.651 --> 26:12.362
University of Amsterdam.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.448
He's got a group that's hiding
Jewish children with families

26:14.448 --> 26:16.909
in the countryside.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.205
JAN: Thank you.
Thank you.

26:36.303 --> 26:39.598
Miep. Miep.

26:46.313 --> 26:50.442
MIEP: They asked.
I was too tired to say no.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.487
You're home late.

26:53.487 --> 26:55.114
Work?

26:55.114 --> 26:57.449
JAN: Yeah.

26:58.742 --> 27:01.495
MIEP: You're up early,
you're out late.

27:01.495 --> 27:04.623
JAN: It's a busy time.

27:09.253 --> 27:13.257
MIEP: I have to
tell you something.

27:17.052 --> 27:20.055
I know we said that we weren't
gonna try to hide the kids.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.432
But I couldn't help it, and I
went to my parents' house to

27:22.432 --> 27:24.685
see if they would take them
in like they did with me.

27:24.685 --> 27:26.270
JAN: What did they say?

27:26.270 --> 27:27.771
MIEP: Well, I couldn't bring
myself to do it because it

27:27.771 --> 27:31.316
would put my parents
in so much danger.

27:31.316 --> 27:34.069
And Cas already has
a target on his back.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.154
And it would make it
more dangerous for him,

27:36.154 --> 27:37.823
and more dangerous for us.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.075
And I really don't
wanna lose my brother.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.327
But, look at them, like,

27:42.327 --> 27:45.372
they're just little kids
and who am I to decide.

27:45.372 --> 27:48.667
JAN: Shh. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.879
MIEP: Why are you smiling?

27:52.421 --> 27:55.507
JAN: I found a place for them.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.969
MIEP: Really?
JAN: Yeah.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.057
(chuckling)

28:04.057 --> 28:05.851
(shushing)

28:08.312 --> 28:11.732
MRS. STOPPELMAN: They're
college students and are
they taking my grandbabies?

28:11.732 --> 28:13.025
JAN: No, no, no.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.735
They just relocate them.

28:14.735 --> 28:17.654
They'll take them to a nice
family in the countryside.

28:17.654 --> 28:20.616
But they said they
have to go tonight.

28:20.616 --> 28:23.160
So Miep and I will take them.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.578
MRS. STOPPELMAN: Why
are you taking them?

28:24.578 --> 28:25.913
MAX: Because you're
a mess, mother,

28:25.913 --> 28:27.873
and it has to happen
quickly and quietly.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.249
MRS. STOPPELMAN: No. No.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.251
JAN: You, you can say
your goodbyes here.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.587
And we'll make sure they
get there safe and sound.

28:33.587 --> 28:36.465
If you'll agree to it.

28:36.465 --> 28:39.134
MRS. STOPPELMAN: It's too quick,
it's too sudden.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.887
MAX: Mother, Jan and Miep
have it all arranged.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.932
We have to trust them.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.271
JAN: Okay, good.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.273
I'll make the arrangements.

28:53.273 --> 28:56.568
MIEP: Mrs. Stoppelman,
do you have any peroxide?

28:57.277 --> 28:58.862
MRS. STOPPELMAN: Why?

28:58.862 --> 29:01.031
MIEP: We have to dye
the children's hair.

29:01.031 --> 29:01.867
MRS. STOPPELMAN: Oh.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.086
MIEP: You all right?
ANNE: No.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.713
MIEP: What is it?
ANNE: Her.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.382
MIEP: You're still angry
that she took that book?

29:18.382 --> 29:20.509
ANNE: I'm angry that I have a
mother who is mean, and wants

29:20.509 --> 29:23.261
me to know as little
about the world as she does.

29:23.261 --> 29:24.888
MIEP: Anne, you have to
stop fighting with her,

29:24.888 --> 29:26.556
the whole neighborhood
can hear you.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.392
And move, the office is
opening in half an hour.

29:28.392 --> 29:29.518
I have to get these upstairs.

29:29.518 --> 29:32.270
ANNE: No, I'll help.
I'll take them.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.855
MIEP: There you go.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.316
Hey, if you wanna be helpful,
stop fighting with your mother.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.527
ANNE: Tell her that.

29:45.033 --> 29:49.121
JOHANNES: Miep, this man is
from the Dutch Nazi Party.

29:50.038 --> 29:53.625
TONNY: You, hello again.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.796
Your friends here are
telling me the same story

29:57.796 --> 30:00.215
you did yesterday.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.676
Tell me where I
can find Otto Frank.

30:02.676 --> 30:04.094
It's urgent I reach him.

30:04.094 --> 30:06.388
We have a business partnership,
and he has abandoned it.

30:06.388 --> 30:08.473
MIEP: What
business partnership?

30:08.473 --> 30:10.350
And what monthly meeting?

30:10.350 --> 30:12.686
I've worked here for years,
and I've never heard of you.

30:12.686 --> 30:14.271
Have you?

30:14.271 --> 30:16.523
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to
understand, so, so I can help.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.567
TONNY: Well, someone
must know where he is.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.485
MIEP: Like I said yesterday,
I have absolutely no idea

30:20.485 --> 30:22.279
where he's gone.

30:22.279 --> 30:24.948
Sorry.

30:24.948 --> 30:27.993
TONNY: One of you.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.957
All right.
Give me your names.

30:33.957 --> 30:36.918
MIEP: Is that necessary?

30:36.918 --> 30:39.796
TONNY: Starting with you.

30:41.048 --> 30:42.632
MIEP: He took
down all our names.

30:42.632 --> 30:44.468
OTTO: He's just
trying to scare you.

30:44.468 --> 30:47.054
MIEP: We don't know
what he plans to do.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.723
He's NSB, he's a Dutch Nazi,

30:49.723 --> 30:52.809
so you have a
partnership with a Nazi.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.857
Sir.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.901
Mr. Frank, we can't
have secrets,

31:00.901 --> 31:03.320
especially not about
things like this.

31:03.320 --> 31:06.615
And if I'm the one downstairs,
I have to be...

31:09.076 --> 31:12.788
that's a pretty good secret.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.210
Oh, no.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.837
OTTO: It's all right.
MIEP: No, thank you. Okay.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.430
OTTO: Edith doesn't know
what I'm going to tell you,

31:30.430 --> 31:33.558
certainly not the girls.

31:34.101 --> 31:35.936
About a year ago,
I was talking to a supplier

31:35.936 --> 31:38.730
at a trade show.

31:38.730 --> 31:43.026
I should have known better but
I was talking about the war.

31:43.860 --> 31:46.196
I told him it will end soon.

31:46.196 --> 31:49.282
And when it does, it won't
end well for the Nazis.

31:49.282 --> 31:51.618
MIEP: Oh.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.831
OTTO: Of course this man
who was a collaborator,

31:55.831 --> 31:58.792
and a good one, he wrote a
letter to the Nazi party

31:58.792 --> 32:00.752
telling them what I said.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.712
And I would have been arrested,

32:02.712 --> 32:07.008
if it weren't for an
enterprising NSB messenger.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.635
MIEP: Tonny Ahlers.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.428
OTTO: Ahlers intercepted the
letter and told me that if

32:10.428 --> 32:14.683
I didn't pay him, he
would give it to the Nazis.

32:14.683 --> 32:16.685
MIEP: So this
"business partnership?"

32:16.685 --> 32:19.563
OTTO: Blackmail.
Pure and simple.

32:19.563 --> 32:21.690
Which would have fine,
before, but now.

32:21.690 --> 32:24.025
MIEP: He thinks
you're in Switzerland.

32:24.025 --> 32:27.195
OTTO: He heard
I'm in Switzerland.

32:28.321 --> 32:31.616
He's ignorant and venal,
Miep, but he's not stupid.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.077
He knows people are hiding.

32:34.077 --> 32:38.331
He's like a dog sniffing
around for a bone.

32:38.331 --> 32:41.209
He won't stop.

32:44.921 --> 32:48.800
And now they're
murdering us by the thousands.

32:49.801 --> 32:53.096
Making piles of us.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.728
I thought we were safe.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.938
I planned so carefully.

33:01.938 --> 33:05.150
Furniture, supplies and
food, piece by piece.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.277
Bit by bit.

33:07.277 --> 33:10.739
I made a paper trail all
the way to Switzerland.

33:11.740 --> 33:14.784
They were safe,
Edith and the girls,

33:14.784 --> 33:18.622
I had them in a safe place.

33:18.622 --> 33:22.667
One sentence and then,
I don't even remember saying

33:22.667 --> 33:24.127
and I failed them.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.337
MIEP: Okay. No. Stop.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.505
Sorry, I can't listen to this.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.425
So you couldn't keep
your mouth shut once?

33:30.425 --> 33:33.720
I'm the Crown Princess
of not being able to
keep her mouth shut.

33:34.971 --> 33:37.766
This is not your fault.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.851
OTTO: It's different.
MIEP: No.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.229
When your family were in
trouble, you moved heaven and

33:42.229 --> 33:44.689
earth for them, you
moved them across Europe.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.650
You built them a fortress.

33:46.650 --> 33:50.362
No one in the world has kept his
children safer than you have.

33:51.780 --> 33:56.409
Mr. Frank, you are the
finest father I've ever met.

33:58.703 --> 34:01.581
And don't worry
about Tonny Ahlers.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.749
He's nothing.

34:02.749 --> 34:05.543
We'll scrape him off our shoe.

34:06.044 --> 34:10.674
(muffled fighting)

34:11.216 --> 34:12.801
OTTO: These two.

34:12.801 --> 34:15.095
MIEP: Oh, she is 13.

34:15.095 --> 34:16.846
OTTO: Yeah, It's true.

34:16.846 --> 34:19.474
It's natural.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.476
She's growing apart
from her mother,

34:21.476 --> 34:24.729
which makes Edith hold her
more tightly and Anne...

34:24.729 --> 34:26.147
MIEP: Fights her harder.

34:26.147 --> 34:28.441
OTTO: Tooth and nail.

34:30.568 --> 34:33.405
Most families, they
would just make little
space for each other.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.449
But for us it's impossible.

34:37.409 --> 34:41.496
Another problem
I didn't foresee.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.834
You'll understand when
you have a daughter.

34:47.627 --> 34:51.881
(train whistle)

34:54.718 --> 34:59.139
(train announcements).

35:14.321 --> 35:16.573
YOUNG MIEP: Mama, please!

35:22.537 --> 35:25.540
ALFRED: I look silly!
Jan, look at my hair.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.626
MIEP: All right. Come.
LIDDY: No, I don't want it!

35:27.626 --> 35:29.210
MIEP: Oh, come on.
LIDDY: I don't want it.

35:29.210 --> 35:30.462
MIEP: Alfred did it.
LIDDY: You can't make me.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.713
MIEP: And he's a baby.
LIDDY: I won't.

35:31.713 --> 35:32.881
MIEP: And he's a boy.
LIDDY: No. Please no.

35:32.881 --> 35:34.299
MIEP: Don't worry,
it will grow back.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.801
LIDDY: No.
Where are we going?

35:36.801 --> 35:39.638
Why can't we stay with you?

35:39.888 --> 35:42.140
MIEP: All right.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.143
I'm going to
tell you something.

35:45.810 --> 35:49.022
When I was a little girl,
I went on a train,

35:49.022 --> 35:52.484
all by myself and I had
no idea where I was going.

35:52.484 --> 35:56.571
And I was, I was really, really
scared just like you are.

35:56.571 --> 35:59.824
LIDDY: Why did
they send you away?

35:59.824 --> 36:03.495
MIEP: Because my
mother had no choice.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.915
I wasn't very well
and I was in trouble,

36:06.915 --> 36:09.918
and I needed help or
I was going to die.

36:10.543 --> 36:14.381
LIDDY: Are we in trouble?

36:15.090 --> 36:18.259
MIEP: Yes.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.973
LIDDY: Where did you go?

36:23.973 --> 36:28.103
MIEP: Oh, well, I went to a
family who could take care of me

36:28.103 --> 36:29.604
and give the help I needed.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.356
And they did.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.316
LIDDY: And then you went home?

36:33.316 --> 36:34.984
MIEP: No, actually.

36:34.984 --> 36:39.489
I loved it so much that I stayed
and it became my new home.

36:40.657 --> 36:42.450
LIDDY: You loved it?

36:42.450 --> 36:46.246
MIEP: I loved it.
It was really fun.

36:46.246 --> 36:51.167
And you know when I did
that I was all on my own,

36:51.167 --> 36:54.129
but you have Alfred.

36:54.796 --> 36:57.590
You have your brother and as
long as you have your brother,

36:57.590 --> 36:59.551
you'll be okay.

36:59.551 --> 37:02.303
You'll be safe.

37:02.929 --> 37:05.014
All right? Okay.

37:05.014 --> 37:07.350
In you go.
Brave girl.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.936
All right.
Let's do it.

37:11.938 --> 37:15.233
You okay?

37:20.613 --> 37:24.784

You are my

might be asked to do things

you must never do.

But the most important
commandment in Judaism

38:12.957 --> 38:15.710

You have to live and you
