00:08.967 --> 00:10.635
No.

00:10.635 --> 00:13.346
Oh, no.
No, no ring.

00:13.346 --> 00:15.390
No phone ring.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.225
- Hello.

00:17.225 --> 00:18.935
Oh, good morning, honey.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.895
It's Mom.
- Nope.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.401
- Oh, no.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.112
No, no.
No ring.

00:29.112 --> 00:32.365
No ring, no ring, no ring.
-

00:32.365 --> 00:33.825
- Please, please.
No ring!

00:33.825 --> 00:35.368
Please, no ring!

00:35.368 --> 00:36.536
Please no ring!
- Okay, okay, I got it!

00:36.536 --> 00:38.371
What?
What?

00:38.371 --> 00:40.707
- Just wanna see how
you're doing, honey.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.876
- How do you think I'm doing?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.794
You locked me in a nuthouse
against my will

00:44.794 --> 00:47.088
when my future wife
is about to get married.

00:47.088 --> 00:49.799
- They don't call them
nuthouses anymore, sweetie.

00:49.799 --> 00:52.969
The lunatics don't like it.
It's a psychiatric hospital.

00:52.969 --> 00:56.681
Look, I know today is
gonna be tough for you,

00:56.681 --> 00:58.975
but I am doing this
for your own good.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.560
- Bullshit.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.979
You're doing this to get my name
off the family trust

01:02.979 --> 01:04.898
so you can have full control
over the company

01:04.898 --> 01:06.733
and do whatever the fuck
you want with it.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.444
- Well, of course I am,
but that is for your own good,

01:09.444 --> 01:11.196
and some day you're
gonna thank me for this.

01:11.196 --> 01:15.742
- Oh, my God, get me out of here
right now, Mom, please!

01:15.742 --> 01:19.412
- You know I can't do that
until the deal is closed.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.664
And you've been acting
irrationally, sweetie.

01:21.664 --> 01:24.709
Giving raises and five-year
deals, I mean, what is that?

01:24.709 --> 01:27.837
- I've never been more rational
in my life.

01:27.837 --> 01:29.964
I was actually thinking about
other people for a change,

01:29.964 --> 01:31.216
not just me.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.009
- That's why I have
to think of you.

01:34.719 --> 01:38.932
- You know what? I've always
tried to protect you, Ma,

01:38.932 --> 01:42.435
more than you'll ever know,
but I'm done.

01:42.435 --> 01:47.440
Have you ever wonder why--why
your husband and your son chose
to die?

01:47.440 --> 01:51.069
- That's not fair.
It was lots of reasons.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.321
Plus, they both had
the suicide gene.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.031
That's a thing, you know.

01:55.031 --> 01:57.951
- Yeah, maybe--maybe they did.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.828
Or maybe it's less
complicated than that.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.512
- Mom, I'm sorry.
I didn't--I didn't mean that.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.098
- It ain't your mom,
it's your limo driver.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.267
Hal?
- Oh, yeah.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.227
Come on, McMurphy.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.603
I'm parked outside the gates.
Let's get you out of here.

02:41.077 --> 02:42.620
Hey, you!
Little man!

02:42.620 --> 02:44.289
Come here!

02:44.289 --> 02:45.832
Don't run, Eddy!
- Stop running, Eddy!

02:45.832 --> 02:47.167
Eddy, stop!

02:49.043 --> 02:51.337
Eddy, what the hell
were you thinking?

02:51.337 --> 02:55.758
♪ Now, now,
now, now, now ♪

02:58.136 --> 03:00.180
Come on, Ed, you gotta
get your head in the game.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.932
All right?
You're like a prisoner here.

03:02.932 --> 03:06.144
Don't you know the warden
be listening to all the phone
calls?

03:06.144 --> 03:09.272
Anyway, I know
it's a single mothers' cliché,

03:09.272 --> 03:11.399
but my life has been all
about raising my daughter,

03:11.399 --> 03:14.319
and I was thrilled
when she moved out.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.654
I mean, I raised
her for this moment.

03:16.654 --> 03:19.240
To be independent,
to chase her dreams.

03:19.240 --> 03:23.453
I mean, it's not like she can be
a marine biologist in the Quad
Cities,

03:23.453 --> 03:26.080
but when she moved out,

03:26.080 --> 03:27.957
I couldn't
get out of bed for 17 days.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.294
- Hey.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.796
- Hi.
How are you?

03:33.796 --> 03:36.424
- I'm insane.

03:36.424 --> 03:39.636
And I guess I realized
for the first time,

03:39.636 --> 03:41.262
that I--
- Okay!

03:41.262 --> 03:43.014
What the hell is that?
What the hell is that?

03:43.014 --> 03:45.308
- Jerry, we talked about these
outbursts. It's not your turn--

03:45.308 --> 03:47.185
- Uh, yes, yes, yes.
But him.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.979
Him--why is he here with us?

03:49.979 --> 03:51.814
I mean, look at him.
He looks dangerous.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.191
I mean, is it even safe to be in
the same room with him right
now?

03:53.191 --> 03:55.193
- He's fine!

03:55.193 --> 03:56.319
I had no life
other than my daughter...

03:56.319 --> 03:57.362
Sarah?

03:57.362 --> 03:59.739
Sarah!
Sarah!

03:59.739 --> 04:01.824
- No yelling allowed, sir!
- Sarah!

04:01.824 --> 04:04.035
Jerry! Jerry!
It's not your turn!

04:04.035 --> 04:05.203
- Ed?
Stop yelling!

04:05.203 --> 04:06.829
- Hey.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.957
I thought that was you.
Why are you in here?

04:08.957 --> 04:11.042
- Manslaughter.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.127
- Wait, really?
- No.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.921
I'm kidding.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.798
I work here.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.259
- Wait, what about the tow yard?

04:19.259 --> 04:22.387
- Well, that's my real job.
I volunteer here.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.139
- Wow, that's--that's
really nice.

04:25.139 --> 04:28.643
- What about you, Ed?
What's going on with you?

04:28.643 --> 04:30.436
- Uh, not much.
All good.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.106
Yeah.
- Really?

04:33.106 --> 04:35.400
- Oh, this? No, that's just
'cause I tried to escape.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.026
No, I'm fine.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.945
Yeah, once this 72-hour
hold is up, I'm gone.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.488
- Okay.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.240
- Hey, where can we get
some food around here?

04:42.240 --> 04:44.158
You might have to feed me,
but I'm fucking starving.

04:57.547 --> 05:01.050
Uh, didn't you forget
to put something in your yogurt?

05:01.050 --> 05:02.969
- What?

05:02.969 --> 05:04.762
- The yogurt.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.432
- Oh, yeah, uh,

05:07.432 --> 05:11.060
no, my--my therapist, he turned
me on to this thing, bottomings.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.229
It's, like, uh, you put
the toppings on the bottom,

05:13.229 --> 05:15.982
and then you do the yogurt,

05:15.982 --> 05:19.277
and then you put
more toppings on top.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.863
- Wow.
He sounds good.

05:21.863 --> 05:25.074
- No, he's a fucking asshole,
but, uh,

05:25.074 --> 05:27.076
at least I'm not depressed
when I eat frozen yogurt now

05:27.076 --> 05:29.537
'cause I got something to
look forward to at the end.

05:29.537 --> 05:33.207
- No, I'm not so worried about
me, I'm worried about him.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.043
- You don't need to
worry about him, okay?

05:35.043 --> 05:37.503
His band is fucking great.

05:37.503 --> 05:41.632
I--trust me, I, like, genuinely,
I felt something at that show,

05:41.632 --> 05:45.011
and if they became, like, a
massive, massive thing, I would
not be surprised.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.304
- Really?
You know music?

05:46.304 --> 05:47.472
- No, I do not.

05:50.516 --> 05:54.937
- So do you think it's such a
good idea for you to be leaving
this place so soon?

05:54.937 --> 05:56.981
- Wh--what do you mean?

05:56.981 --> 05:59.359
- Well, I'm just saying
that you've been through a lot

05:59.359 --> 06:01.027
with your brother
and everything.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.987
You know, maybe you should
stick around a little longer.

06:02.987 --> 06:05.990
- Well, I--I can't.

06:05.990 --> 06:09.702
My girlfriend, she's about to
get married to another guy.

06:09.702 --> 06:13.247
- And yet, you're still
calling her your girlfriend.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.211
I mean, it sucks.
It's not ideal.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.214
Anyway, besides that,
I'm doing--I'm doing this thing.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.884
It's called "living in the now,"
and I can't do that here.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.886
- Wait, why not?

06:26.886 --> 06:29.263
- Well, because
there's no now here.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.474
- Well, of course there is.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.811
Wherever you are,
there's the now.

06:34.811 --> 06:38.689
- I guess, but it's, uh-- it's
not the now I'm looking for.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.901
- You don't have to look for it,
it's just always there.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.986
- No, I get that.
I do, I do.

06:43.986 --> 06:47.907
But it's like, I'm looking for
a different--a different now.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.576
- You told me this exact same
thing the first time we met.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.995
- When did I say that?

06:52.995 --> 06:55.873
- Um, you said that you worked
at a tractor company,

06:55.873 --> 06:57.542
but you didn't
really do anything

06:57.542 --> 06:59.877
because you were waiting
for the next thing.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.713
That tractor company
was your now,

07:02.713 --> 07:04.882
so do you ever live in the now?

07:07.927 --> 07:09.846
- Okay.
You're pretty good at this.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.142
You know, you should listen
to this guy, Eckhart.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.435
He's got these
audio books and...

07:15.435 --> 07:17.395
- Eckhart Tolle.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.522
- Yes, yeah.
Wait--you know him?

07:19.522 --> 07:22.400
- Yeah, I was the one that
left the CDs in your car.

07:26.028 --> 07:28.823
Wait, so you--you put the--

07:28.823 --> 07:31.492
- Yeah, when I went and towed
your brother's car from the
bridge,

07:31.492 --> 07:33.244
I left it in the front seat.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.746
For you.
Well, not specifically for you,

07:35.746 --> 07:39.917
because I didn't know you,
obviously, but for whoever
picked up the car.

07:39.917 --> 07:43.004
When it's a suicide, I do that.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.215
- Why?
I don't know.

07:46.215 --> 07:49.093
I think because I'm always
trying to improve myself,

07:49.093 --> 07:52.305
and those CDs help me,
like, so much,

07:52.305 --> 07:56.267
and if I had lost a loved one
to suicide,

07:56.267 --> 07:59.228
I think I would be
always living in the past,

07:59.228 --> 08:02.231
and wondering if there was
something I could have done to
help them.

08:03.983 --> 08:07.236
And Eckhart said that the answer
isn't in the past.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.363
It's in the now.

08:11.949 --> 08:15.328
-
- So did the CDs help you?

08:17.788 --> 08:20.208
- I mean, I'm, uh,

08:20.208 --> 08:23.002
strapped to a wheelchair
eating frozen yogurt

08:23.002 --> 08:25.379
with you in a nuthouse,

08:25.379 --> 08:28.257
so yes, I, uh, I think it did.
Very much so.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.800
- Mm-hmm.

08:31.802 --> 08:32.929
Thank you.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.267
- What the hell was Ed thinking?
Across the board raises?

08:38.267 --> 08:40.811
- It doesn't mean anything.

08:40.811 --> 08:44.690
- Roger, she's right.
It doesn't mean anything.

08:44.690 --> 08:48.152
No contract was signed with the
employees, so we don't have to
honor it.

08:48.152 --> 08:50.404
- But he was an officer of the
company when he made the
statement.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.823
They could argue
that it was a verbal contract.

08:52.823 --> 08:56.577
- Yeah, which is why when Maxine
had Ed committed for being a
whackadoo,

08:56.577 --> 08:59.080
it was a brilliant move.
- My son is not a whackadoo.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.833
He's just been through a lot.

09:02.833 --> 09:06.712
- Oh, don't kid yourself, Maxie.
Ed's a fucking wingnut.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.507
- We will argue in court that
Ed was mentally incapacitated

09:09.507 --> 09:12.093
when he made the commitment.

09:12.093 --> 09:15.263
Now he's unable to fulfill his
duties as an officer of the
company.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.681
- Yeah, okay.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.474
That should suffice.
Yeah.

09:18.474 --> 09:21.561
- No, I won't have that
said about Ed in court.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.562
- What?

09:23.646 --> 09:25.940
- That he's nuts.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.484
- Look, I don't give
a shit what you want.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.695
It's what you have to do if you
want us to buy your company.
