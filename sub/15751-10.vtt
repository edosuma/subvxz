It's not in the Bible.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.590
It's a-- it's a tradition.

11:49.590 --> 11:52.260
It's about being
free from vanity,

11:52.260 --> 11:55.420
about being free from that
extra layer of being seen,

11:55.420 --> 11:57.440
just letting us be.

11:57.440 --> 11:58.880
-Mm.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.090
There's another one in here.

12:00.090 --> 12:00.790
-Great.

12:00.790 --> 12:02.400
Thank you.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.200
-That's nice.

12:03.200 --> 12:03.980
Ugh.

12:03.980 --> 12:08.290
I know so little about
Judaism it's sad.

12:08.290 --> 12:10.070
-You have a horrible
bat mitzvah.

12:10.070 --> 12:12.210
-I didn't have a bat mitzvah.

12:12.210 --> 12:13.740
My parents let me cancel it.

12:16.070 --> 12:16.770
-Wow.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.390
That was--

12:18.390 --> 12:19.280
-Awful?

12:19.280 --> 12:21.340
-Well, I was going to say--

12:21.340 --> 12:22.630
-Horrible parenting?

12:22.630 --> 12:26.640
-People make mistakes
and then grow.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.930
From an outsider
perspective, I think

12:28.930 --> 12:31.440
your-- your family
is incredible.

12:31.440 --> 12:36.230
And your-- your brother
is just, uh, amazing.

12:36.230 --> 12:38.130
I could not be happier.

12:38.130 --> 12:38.830
-Wow.

12:38.830 --> 12:40.250
-I know that that's a lot.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.280
I hope that's OK.

12:41.280 --> 12:42.010
I-- I-- we-- we--

12:42.010 --> 12:42.710
-Yeah.

12:42.710 --> 12:43.410
No.

12:43.410 --> 12:46.270
I mean-- wow.

12:46.270 --> 12:46.970
-Uh-oh.

12:49.630 --> 12:50.330
-Oh.

12:52.900 --> 12:53.600
-Oh, no.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.790
I feel like maybe
you're-- there's something

12:54.790 --> 12:55.880
that you're not telling me.

12:55.880 --> 12:56.640
If there-- please.

12:59.480 --> 13:00.470
Please tell me.

13:03.510 --> 13:04.210
-OK.

13:04.210 --> 13:07.360
Well, I think Josh
has a kind of fucked

13:07.360 --> 13:09.760
up relationship with women.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.290
And there's been a lot of women.

13:11.290 --> 13:11.990
-Oh.

13:11.990 --> 13:12.920
Yeah.

13:12.920 --> 13:13.840
I-- yes.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.990
-I mean, I'm not saying
he's, like, a sex addict

13:16.990 --> 13:22.070
or love addict
or-- I don't know.

13:22.070 --> 13:23.570
Maybe he's a love addict.

13:27.910 --> 13:30.320
-I should hang this probably.

13:33.210 --> 13:34.820
-I'm-- I'm sorry.

13:41.240 --> 13:42.540
-I've got that.

13:42.540 --> 13:43.230
OK.

13:46.730 --> 13:47.730
It's OK.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.200
-Oh, my god.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.510
It always looks so nice.

14:02.510 --> 14:04.490
I remember when I got this.

14:04.490 --> 14:07.940
I got this at that little
place in the East Village

14:07.940 --> 14:09.150
when we were in New York.

14:09.150 --> 14:09.850
Do you remember?

14:09.850 --> 14:10.550
-Yeah.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.830
-Looks really nice.

14:11.830 --> 14:13.320
Are you doing OK?

14:13.320 --> 14:14.710
That was so weird.

14:14.710 --> 14:17.070
I'm so glad you're here, though.

14:17.070 --> 14:17.770
Thank you for coming.

14:17.770 --> 14:21.380
-Kind of weird being replaced.

14:25.180 --> 14:26.650
-You're not replaced.

14:30.580 --> 14:32.000
-Do you miss anything?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.480
-Yes.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.350
-You miss my cock?

14:37.350 --> 14:38.850
-Sometimes I miss your cock.

14:38.850 --> 14:41.050
-Sometimes you miss my cock.

14:41.050 --> 14:44.200
Because what-- what, like,
toy is-- that's just plastic.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.640
-They're really not that bad.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.560
-Oh, they've made
significant advancements

14:47.560 --> 14:49.400
in the field of dildo-ology.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.370
-Yes, they have.

14:50.370 --> 14:51.200
-Or whatever it is.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.220
-They're very good.

14:52.220 --> 14:54.260
There's different
shapes and sizes.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.370
-It's not the same.

14:55.370 --> 14:58.840
It's not like a warm,
hot, throbbing cock.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.320
You're so good at
sucking my fucking cock.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.320
-Oh, god.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.090
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:07.090 --> 15:07.780
-What?

15:10.770 --> 15:12.260
-I love you.

15:16.730 --> 15:17.720
-Wait, wait, wait.

15:17.720 --> 15:19.220
-What?

15:19.220 --> 15:22.200
-I don't want to be
a fucking secret.

15:22.200 --> 15:25.480
Just because you're
from this family

15:25.480 --> 15:27.300
doesn't mean you have
to be like this family.

15:38.690 --> 15:40.320
-Uncle Ed loved to golf.

15:40.320 --> 15:44.280
I remember this one time he hit
this, like, nasty chip shot.

15:44.280 --> 15:48.080
It was, like, the best one
I've ever seen in person.

15:48.080 --> 15:48.870
He'll be missed.

15:48.870 --> 15:49.270
-Hey.

15:49.270 --> 15:50.010
Where's Raquel?

15:50.010 --> 15:52.080
-I don't know.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.740
TAMMY: I know the desserts
are being put out up there.

15:54.740 --> 15:56.080
-She's leaving.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.820
TAMMY: Kids, they
love the mochi.

15:57.820 --> 16:00.070
And I got the mochi
in the freezer.

16:00.070 --> 16:00.810
-Where you going?

16:00.810 --> 16:03.100
-Uh, got another
funeral I got to go to.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.360
I double-booked.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.940
-What are you talking about?

16:07.940 --> 16:09.790
What are you talking--
stop running.

16:09.790 --> 16:10.750
Hey.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.890
Why are you lying to me?

16:12.890 --> 16:13.650
What happened?

16:13.650 --> 16:14.760
-I'm not lying.

16:14.760 --> 16:15.510
That's--

16:15.510 --> 16:17.110
-Hey.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.680
I love you.

16:18.680 --> 16:19.380
-Wow.

16:19.380 --> 16:20.910
-I want to have babies with you.

16:20.910 --> 16:22.600
I want to-- I want to
do everything with you.

16:22.600 --> 16:23.640
I should have said it earlier.

16:23.640 --> 16:24.730
I love you.

16:24.730 --> 16:25.750
Do you understand?

16:25.750 --> 16:27.830
I've, like, never
loved anybody before.

16:27.830 --> 16:29.470
OK?

16:29.470 --> 16:31.050
Please.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.940
-Fuck you.

16:32.940 --> 16:33.710
-What?

16:33.710 --> 16:35.140
Hey, fuck.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.440
What happened?

16:39.440 --> 16:40.210
-Uh.

16:40.210 --> 16:41.300
-What happened?
Something happened.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.030
-Let me go.

16:42.030 --> 16:42.730
-No.

16:42.730 --> 16:44.870
Somebody told you something?

16:44.870 --> 16:46.750
Was it Syd?

16:46.750 --> 16:48.890
Did she say something to you?

16:48.890 --> 16:52.810
-Why would Syd say
anything to me?

16:52.810 --> 16:54.370
-Rita.

16:54.370 --> 16:55.410
Rita said something to you?

16:55.410 --> 16:56.160
-Wow, Josh.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.380
How many are there?

16:57.380 --> 16:58.770
How many are there?

16:58.770 --> 17:00.390
-Well, who the fuck did
you talk to in there?

17:00.390 --> 17:01.090
-Rita, Syd.

17:01.090 --> 17:02.120
Are there-- where am I on the--

17:02.120 --> 17:02.820
-Who cares?

17:02.820 --> 17:03.720
I fucking love you.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.210
-Are you promising
babies to all of them?

17:05.210 --> 17:05.660
-No!

17:05.660 --> 17:06.100
-Shut up!

17:06.100 --> 17:06.800
-I'm not!

17:10.590 --> 17:11.290
Fuck!

17:21.360 --> 17:23.020
You say something to Raquel?

17:23.020 --> 17:23.930
-Who's Raquel?

17:23.930 --> 17:24.630
-The rabbi.

17:24.630 --> 17:25.690
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:25.690 --> 17:28.190
I told her what a
great service it was.

17:28.190 --> 17:28.890
-Yeah?

17:28.890 --> 17:29.320
That's it?

17:29.320 --> 17:30.420
Because it--it
kind of feels like

17:30.420 --> 17:31.540
you're lying to me right now.

17:31.540 --> 17:34.400
-That's really
what I was saying.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.800
By your tone, I'm
assuming she's something

17:37.800 --> 17:39.420
more than a rabbi maybe.

17:39.420 --> 17:40.580
Latest conquest?

17:40.580 --> 17:41.740
-She's not a conquest.

17:41.740 --> 17:42.740
OK?

17:42.740 --> 17:44.310
She's an incredible person.

17:44.310 --> 17:46.770
She's, like, the best
person I've ever met.

17:46.770 --> 17:47.530
-Nice, Josh.

17:47.530 --> 17:48.230
OK.

17:52.080 --> 17:52.780
Here.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.230
Uh.

17:54.230 --> 17:54.930
-Hi.

17:54.930 --> 17:55.710
-This is Colton.

17:55.710 --> 17:56.410
-Colton.

17:56.410 --> 17:57.110
-Yeah.

17:57.110 --> 17:57.850
Josh.

17:57.850 --> 17:58.890
Enjoying the shiva?

17:58.890 --> 17:59.580
-Yeah.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.700
Uh, it's my first-- first one.

18:01.700 --> 18:02.400
-Great.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.030
Hope you're having a good time.

18:04.030 --> 18:04.730
Yeah.

18:04.730 --> 18:06.140
We got some Reese's
Pieces out there.

18:06.140 --> 18:07.070
You can check them out.

18:07.070 --> 18:08.290
-Maybe.

18:08.290 --> 18:09.510
Do you want me to--

18:09.510 --> 18:10.320
-Oh.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.020
-I can--

18:11.020 --> 18:12.440
-Do what?

18:12.440 --> 18:15.160
-I don't-- I don't really
know how to-- how to say this.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.170
I'll just-- I'll just say it.

18:16.170 --> 18:21.140
Um, Rita's my birth mum.

18:21.140 --> 18:28.260
And so, I guess, um-- I
guess that makes you my dad.

18:28.260 --> 18:28.960
-Yeah.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.970
He's our son.

18:30.970 --> 18:31.670
I--

18:38.520 --> 18:39.740
TAMMY: Hey, babe.

18:39.740 --> 18:41.130
-One second, babe.

18:41.130 --> 18:42.160
TAMMY: Babe, come on.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.290
Memory circle's
coming to a close.

18:43.290 --> 18:43.990
Where are you?

18:43.990 --> 18:44.720
-Oh, hey.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.060
-Hey.

18:45.060 --> 18:45.760
-Sorry.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.840
I spilled some wine,
and I just had to--

18:47.840 --> 18:48.580
-Oh.

18:48.580 --> 18:49.340
-Clean it up.

18:49.340 --> 18:50.040
-You OK?
-Yeah, yeah.

18:50.040 --> 18:50.740
It's all good.

18:50.740 --> 18:51.480
-OK, good.
-I'm good.

18:51.480 --> 18:52.680
-So you think people
like the house?

18:52.680 --> 18:53.690
-Oh, my god.

18:53.690 --> 18:54.630
I think they're really--

18:54.630 --> 18:55.400
-I know.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.600
-Really, it's so
perfect for this.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.780
-It really opened up
great for an event.

18:58.780 --> 19:01.630
-Thanks for-- that was
really good, the circle,

19:01.630 --> 19:02.460
and-- I'm sorry.

19:02.460 --> 19:03.360
-Oh, yeah No, yeah.

19:03.360 --> 19:03.800
No.

19:03.800 --> 19:04.500
It's OK.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.460
You OK, hon?

19:05.460 --> 19:06.160
-Yeah.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.080
I'm fine.

19:07.080 --> 19:07.880
What?

19:07.880 --> 19:11.220
-You just kind of have a
funny look on your face.

19:11.220 --> 19:12.240
I think we should get married.

19:18.930 --> 19:21.690
-I mean beyond thanking you
all for attending, I just,

19:21.690 --> 19:25.680
uh-- I wanted to say
how grateful I am,

19:25.680 --> 19:28.740
how wonderful
you've been with me

19:28.740 --> 19:31.990
during my recent
life transition.

19:31.990 --> 19:36.470
At West Lake Elementary
School, there was Mrs. Painter.

19:36.470 --> 19:40.500
And I was standing in the
girls' line, and it felt right.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.460
We've talked about this.

19:41.460 --> 19:42.310
-Mm-hm.

19:42.310 --> 19:45.140
-And, uh, she made me
get out of that line

19:45.140 --> 19:47.030
and stand in the boys' line.

19:47.030 --> 19:48.810
-I have to pish.

19:48.810 --> 19:51.010
-That's when I knew
something was different.

19:51.010 --> 19:53.260
-Well, well, I'm--I'm from
Overland Park, Kansas.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.440
Um.

19:54.440 --> 19:55.140
It's a nice area.

19:55.140 --> 19:56.480
Um, you know, I, uh--

19:56.480 --> 19:57.180
-Kansas?

19:57.180 --> 19:57.710
-Yeah.

19:57.710 --> 19:58.410
Yeah.

19:58.410 --> 19:59.820
I'm-- I'm going to be
a senior this year.

20:02.650 --> 20:04.970
I really like sushi.

20:04.970 --> 20:05.820
-Yeah?

20:05.820 --> 20:06.520
-Yeah.

20:06.520 --> 20:10.410
And nobody else, uh, really
likes sushi by me over there.

cancelled my bat mitzvah so you

to cancel bat mitzvahs.

your bat mitzvah.

22:13.140 --> 22:14.730
