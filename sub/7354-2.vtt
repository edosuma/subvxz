00:01.835 --> 00:03.569
<i>Previously on</i> legends...

00:05.005 --> 00:06.872
(grunting)

00:06.874 --> 00:08.841
Gates:
<i>Martin is</i>
<i>the most naturally gifted</i>

00:08.843 --> 00:10.476
Deep cover operative
that we've got.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.710
Three out of four shrinks
on the committee

00:11.712 --> 00:13.345
Found him unfit for duty.

00:15.048 --> 00:16.382
There is no martin odum.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.017
Everything about
him is fake.

00:18.019 --> 00:19.184
Need a favor, bobby.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.719
I'm hoping
you can clean this up enough

00:20.721 --> 00:22.554
To make an id.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.823
<i>My friend died trying</i>
<i>to find out who you are.</i>

00:24.825 --> 00:26.025
Meet me at union station.

00:26.027 --> 00:27.026
I need to give you something.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.260
(grunts)

00:30.163 --> 00:31.697
Hey!

00:31.699 --> 00:33.499
Who am I?!

00:33.501 --> 00:34.933
There's a book, left pocket.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.874
(radio playing)

00:41.876 --> 00:43.475
Man:
<i>I can't,</i>
<i>not when the mother's claiming</i>

00:43.477 --> 00:44.576
<i>That I have it out for him.</i>

00:44.578 --> 00:46.045
Woman (chuckles):
<i>Do you?</i>

00:46.047 --> 00:48.547
(chuckles)
he's hardly showed
up for class.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.249
What kind of grade does she
think I'm gonna give him?

00:50.251 --> 00:52.051
Come on.
Okay, you're right.

00:52.053 --> 00:56.055
(siren wailing)

00:56.057 --> 00:58.724
Is that...?
Oh, man, was I speeding?

00:58.726 --> 01:00.092
Girl:
No, dad, they only

01:00.094 --> 01:01.593
Pull you over
if you're not speeding.

01:01.595 --> 01:02.861
Thank you, jane,
I appreciate that.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.229
Woman:
Quiet, jane.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.668
(indistinct radio transmission)

01:14.741 --> 01:16.909
I hope he's a nice one.

01:19.446 --> 01:20.913
License

01:20.915 --> 01:21.880
And registration.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.248
Here we go.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.089
Your license
is expired, sir.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.591
Please step out of the
vehicle. Out of the car, sir.
What? I just renewed that

01:32.593 --> 01:33.759
Last year.
Now.

01:33.761 --> 01:34.793
Can't you just do what he says?

01:34.795 --> 01:35.994
(sighs)

01:42.235 --> 01:43.435
Please have
a seat.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.172
Why are they putting him
in the car?

01:48.908 --> 01:50.476
(camera clicks)
I'd like to know
what I did.

01:54.481 --> 01:56.515
(speaking russian)

01:58.485 --> 02:00.018
Who the hell are you?

02:02.155 --> 02:04.690
(siren whooping)

02:13.800 --> 02:14.633
Why are they getting
out of the car?

02:14.635 --> 02:15.634
Fellas need a hand?

02:15.636 --> 02:18.470
Man:
Hey! Help! Help!

02:18.472 --> 02:20.472
They're not real police!
Help!

02:21.975 --> 02:22.674
(gasps)

02:22.676 --> 02:23.809
(speaks russian)

02:25.812 --> 02:27.446
(whimpers)

02:27.448 --> 02:28.514
(starts engine)
who the hell are you?

02:28.516 --> 02:30.616
Where, where are you taking me?

02:30.618 --> 02:32.551
<i>Where are you taking my</i>
<i>family?</i>

02:54.340 --> 02:56.675
How are you sleeping?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.343
Fine.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.145
Mmm. How many
hours a night?

03:00.147 --> 03:02.848
Um, four or five.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.516
Sexual function. Normal?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.685
Exceptional.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.588
So I'm told.

03:12.659 --> 03:14.359
Describe your
mood today.

03:14.361 --> 03:17.329
I'm walking
on sunshine. Look,

03:17.331 --> 03:18.530
I'm just trying to settle in.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.033
You know, readjust
to normal life and whatnot.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.635
Why don't you just fill in
the rest? I'm fine.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.538
Martin, your covert status
requires this evaluation.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.673
Mm-hmm.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.408
It's a condition
of your employment.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.776
Sure.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.713
Um, could I get a coffee,
please?

03:34.715 --> 03:35.781
Halstrom:
Yeah.

03:37.016 --> 03:39.017
He's dodging the questions,

03:39.019 --> 03:40.686
And you know how he gets away

03:40.688 --> 03:42.087
With it.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.589
(sighs)

03:43.591 --> 03:45.557
We don't know
if that accent's even real.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.259
What does the man have to do
to prove himself to you?

03:47.261 --> 03:50.028
Convince me
he's mentally fit for duty.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.363
He saved your life.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.532
The word that springs to mind
is "hero."

03:53.534 --> 03:56.034
Halstrom:
I know in your line of work
you've killed people.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.035
Okay.

03:57.037 --> 03:57.769
Flawed hero.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.239
Criminals. It happens.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.174
Halstrom: Why did you and sonya
decide to separate?

04:02.176 --> 04:04.876
Martin: None of your business.
Sir, if I can't control
my operative, I can't do my job.

04:04.878 --> 04:05.877
Then request a transfer.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.246
I'm happy
to make a call.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.114
Halstrom: There are reasons
for asking these things, martin.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.382
Excuse me. I
have a debrief

04:10.384 --> 04:12.284
With the u.S. Attorney
to prep for.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.052
Relationships can affect
an undercover's state of mind.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.887
Agent mcguire,

04:15.889 --> 04:18.056
I put you and martin together
because you're both the best

04:18.058 --> 04:19.091
At what you do.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.425
Martin:
Jeopardizing the case.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.460
That's your concern, isn't it?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.128
You can make major cases here.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.430
The dco can be your ticket
to deputy ranks.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.565
Washington.

04:26.567 --> 04:27.432
Don't take
the shot

04:27.434 --> 04:28.734
For granted.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.068
Yes, sir.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.237
Halstrom:
My concern is
your mental health.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.106
After you
two separated,

04:34.108 --> 04:35.641
You went back under
with the militia.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.643
<i>Then you disappeared</i>
<i>for six months,</i>

04:37.645 --> 04:39.645
<i>Not one communication</i>
<i>with your handler.</i>

04:39.647 --> 04:41.480
Did you contact sonya at
all during that time?

04:41.482 --> 04:44.650
Or your son?
Why is that relevant?

04:44.652 --> 04:46.285
No, I didn't.

04:46.287 --> 04:47.653
You've seen them
since you came back?

04:47.655 --> 04:49.921
Sonya:
<i>You disappear for weeks on</i>
<i>end.</i>

04:49.923 --> 04:52.958
No calls, nothing. And then
you show up and you don't even
know who you are half the time.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.626
Martin:
<i>Well, you're not giving me</i>
<i>a chance here.</i>

04:54.628 --> 04:55.961
<i>I'm out there.</i>

04:55.963 --> 04:58.130
I'm doing it. I'm doing this
for you and aiden.

04:58.132 --> 04:59.765
And you're not giving me
a chance!

04:59.767 --> 05:01.166
(clatter)

05:01.168 --> 05:03.302
Dad?

05:04.470 --> 05:06.138
Why are you breaking stuff?

05:06.140 --> 05:09.174
Sonya and I will work it out.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.342
How's aiden handling the split?

05:10.344 --> 05:11.376
He's fine.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.313
You don't like talking
about them.

05:14.315 --> 05:18.016
Do you find that feelings
in your undercover work

05:18.018 --> 05:19.785
Affect your real life?

05:19.787 --> 05:22.921
I keep my family away
from what I do.

05:22.923 --> 05:26.358
And I keep the kind of people
I deal with away from them.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.993
Does forgetting them make
the legend feel more real?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.329
Insofar as you can shut off
martin odum, you can...

05:30.331 --> 05:32.831
You asked me the same questions
the last time we met.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.633
Is it difficult to
leave a legend behind

05:34.635 --> 05:35.834
When you're done?
As I said

05:35.836 --> 05:37.369
Last time, no.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.172
Security says you signed
in downstairs this morning

05:40.174 --> 05:41.340
As lincoln dittmann.

05:41.342 --> 05:44.142
Did you
know that?
It was a joke.

05:44.144 --> 05:47.379
When the founding father
was arrested...

05:48.848 --> 05:50.515
...The lincoln dittmann
legend was exposed.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.018
<i>Did you have difficulty</i>
<i>saying good-bye?</i>

05:54.554 --> 05:57.489
Martin:
<i>A legend is an elaborate lie.</i>

05:57.491 --> 05:58.724
<i>That's all.</i>

05:59.692 --> 06:01.860
<i>Easy to walk away from.</i>

06:11.504 --> 06:13.171
Halstrom:
<i>Since you came back,</i>

06:13.173 --> 06:14.906
Have you had any thoughts
of suicide?

06:14.908 --> 06:16.842
Not my own, no.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.044
Paranoia? Feeling like

06:19.046 --> 06:21.046
Someone's out
to get you?
Someone often is.

06:21.048 --> 06:21.913
Any memory loss?

06:21.915 --> 06:24.049
Forgetting
basic things?

06:24.051 --> 06:25.117
No.

06:26.085 --> 06:28.553
Halstrom:
<i>Confusion of identity?</i>

06:28.555 --> 06:30.422
<i>Not being able</i>
<i>to tell your legends</i>

06:30.424 --> 06:33.592
<i>From your real life?</i>

06:33.594 --> 06:36.561
I know who I am.

06:45.371 --> 06:46.538
How'd the psych eval go?

06:46.540 --> 06:47.439
Feeling much better now.

06:47.441 --> 06:50.108
(both laugh)

06:50.110 --> 06:51.610
We missed you
at bobby's funeral.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.413
Yeah. I, uh... I had a thing.
With aiden.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.114
Well, you haven't seen him much.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.616
No.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.284
Bobby's folks,
they appreciated the flowers.

06:59.286 --> 07:02.220
Oh, good.

07:02.222 --> 07:05.123
Did you get a chance
to follow up on his autopsy,

07:05.125 --> 07:06.291
Like I said?

07:06.293 --> 07:07.626
I did.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.528
No poisons, toxins,

07:09.530 --> 07:11.296
Nothing foreign in the blood.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.598
M.E. Is standing firm
on the cause of death.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.000
It was not a homicide.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.771
(sighs)
32 years old.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.274
With a heart defect
from birth.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.075
M.E. Says
it was just a matter of time.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.945
Now, I'd like to know
why you're asking.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.447
Just seemed unusual to me.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.782
I got a briefing
in a couple of minutes.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.983
You want to talk after?

07:31.985 --> 07:34.052
No, don't worry about it.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.791
(grunting)

07:41.761 --> 07:44.162
(man speaking russian)

07:44.164 --> 07:45.497
(grunts)

07:46.098 --> 07:48.166
(grunts, moaning)

07:51.804 --> 07:52.971
You're looking at a kidnapping
that occurred

07:52.973 --> 07:54.639
In bakersfield last night.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.808
The victims' car and
the suspects' police vehicle

07:56.810 --> 08:00.178
Were found torched
outside of town.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.746
No sign

08:01.748 --> 08:02.981
Of the family.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.483
Richard hubbard is

08:04.485 --> 08:06.985
A high school chemistry teacher,
susan's a paralegal.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.321
Uh, jane, his daughter,
is an honor roll student.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.690
They're your typical
middle-class faces in the crowd.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.125
Pro kidnapping,
low-level target?

08:14.127 --> 08:15.861
Someone's got a secret.

08:15.863 --> 08:19.030
I got a call from langley
this morning.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.033
He's russian?

08:22.035 --> 08:23.201
Richard hubbard's
real name

08:23.203 --> 08:25.337
Is dr. Alexander
nevelsky.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.005
He is a chemist.
Back then,

08:27.007 --> 08:28.106
He was actively involved

08:28.108 --> 08:30.141
In russia's chemical weapons
program.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.677
Until the mafia moved in.
And when nevelsky discovered

08:32.679 --> 08:35.180
They were selling vx nerve gas
on the black market,

08:35.182 --> 08:37.182
He tried to blow the whistle.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.985
They went after him,
and he came to us for asylum.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.721
Fortunately, the intel
he provided allowed us
to interdict most

08:42.723 --> 08:44.389
Of the vx.

08:44.391 --> 08:47.192
Most but
not all.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.494
How did he get to bakersfield?

08:49.496 --> 08:50.362
Langley relocated him.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.197
Gave him a new identity.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.899
We think his old russian friends
have found him.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.535
(man speaking russian)

08:56.537 --> 08:57.702
That's a chechen dialect.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.205
We're talking about
the obshina-- chechen mafia.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.375
And that's why I'm here.
I understand dco

09:03.377 --> 09:05.377
May have a legend placed
inside the chechen mob.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.912
Gates:
We won't confirm
or deny

09:06.914 --> 09:10.515
Dco's active legends, but we may
have an asset in play.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.884
What do you need?
Well, I have teams
running down leads,

09:12.886 --> 09:14.519
Talking
to the local russian community,

09:14.521 --> 09:16.588
But we're not getting
much traction.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.523
And time is running out for this
family. Whatever information

09:18.525 --> 09:22.027
That you can get
from your sources...

09:22.029 --> 09:24.029
Okay.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.797
Thank you, agent kitson.
Thank you.

09:29.168 --> 09:31.269
There's only two motives here.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.871
They're gonna
make vx to sell,

09:32.873 --> 09:34.072
They're gonna make vx to use.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.440
I don't like either of 'em.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.942
Well, why would they make
the weapon here

09:36.944 --> 09:38.276
If they weren't gonna use it
here?

09:38.278 --> 09:39.744
Gates:
Reach out
to the nsa,

09:39.746 --> 09:41.680
See if they've heard any chatter
from the usual suspects--

09:41.682 --> 09:43.415
Al-qaeda, domestic militias...

09:43.417 --> 09:45.050
Okay. Got it.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.217
I'm the new girl,

09:46.219 --> 09:47.252
So...

09:47.254 --> 09:48.620
Who is the asset?

09:48.622 --> 09:50.121
Troy runs a ci

09:50.123 --> 09:51.923
Who's pretty dialed in
to the russian mob.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.391
Operates an underground
club downtown.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.726
A lot of the clientele
are chechen.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.394
A lot of them
are with the obshina.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.897
They use the club to launder
cash for drugs and prostitution.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.099
I show up at the club a
few times a month as a...

10:01.101 --> 10:02.734
Genius money guy
named spencer holt.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.569
My ci introduces
me around.

10:04.571 --> 10:05.804
It's been
an intelligence gold mine.

10:05.806 --> 10:06.972
What's spencer's story?

10:06.974 --> 10:08.139
Disgraced
tax attorney.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.641
Ten months out of the pen
for wire fraud.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.443
He lost
his law license,

10:11.445 --> 10:14.679
Now he's using his skills
to launder criminal cash.

10:15.748 --> 10:18.216
Sweat your ci, work
the chechen angle.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.618
See what pops
on the kidnapping.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.786
Take martin as backup.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.121
(door opens)

10:23.123 --> 10:24.789
(gasps)

10:24.791 --> 10:26.257
Dad, dad.
Richard.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.492
(gasps)
oh, my god.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.461
Oh, my god, are you okay?
Did they hurt you?

10:29.463 --> 10:31.229
I was so worried.
(man speaking russian)

10:34.634 --> 10:37.602
Who are these people?
What do they want with us?

10:37.604 --> 10:38.603
I don't know.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.105
Jane:
I'm scared, dad.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.407
No, shh, shh, shh, shh, w-we're
gonna be okay, sweetheart,

10:42.409 --> 10:43.475
We're gonna be okay.

10:44.777 --> 10:47.846
Yes, we know who you are.
I don't know

10:47.848 --> 10:49.814
What you're talking about.
My name is richard hubbard.

11:01.694 --> 11:04.863
Richard?
Who is that?

11:06.499 --> 11:09.167
(man cackles)

11:09.169 --> 11:11.469
Of course
he speaks russian. Huh?

11:11.471 --> 11:12.570
You didn't know?

11:18.844 --> 11:20.845
(door clicks shut)
who are you?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.180
Susan...

11:22.182 --> 11:25.083
Please let me explain.
Who are you?

11:32.458 --> 11:34.125
Excuse me.
Special agent rice?

11:34.127 --> 11:35.560
He's over there.
Donnie,
I'm telling you,

11:35.562 --> 11:36.728
I don't care, man.
I'm talking about

11:36.730 --> 11:38.063
What the man's
achieved, all right?

11:38.065 --> 11:40.365
Yeah. Yeah, I'm still
holding, unfortunately.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.133
Best cornerback in the league--
can say whatever the hell

11:42.135 --> 11:45.036
He wants to say,
period. To anybody.
Agent rice.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.538
Martin odum.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.573
I, uh, I work
upstairs in dco.

11:48.575 --> 11:52.577
You cover the city's
subways and trains, yeah?

11:52.579 --> 11:54.713
Yeah, planes, trains,
and automobiles.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.015
What can I do
for you?

11:57.017 --> 11:59.551
I, um...

11:59.553 --> 12:01.386
There was a murder two days ago.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.756
Homeless guy stabbed on the
subway platform at civic center.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.358
Wondered if, uh, lapd
had looped you in?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.861
Yeah. Any major crime
on the subway,

12:09.863 --> 12:12.297
They copy us on the report.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.834
Yup, here it is. It's, uh,

12:15.836 --> 12:17.268
Male, black.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.838
Single stab wound
to the mid-abdominal region.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.407
He died on the scene.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.609
Anything else you can tell me?

12:26.345 --> 12:28.513
Uh, well, it's a...
Homeless guy got shivved.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.082
Nobody saw anything. Looks like
the surveillance camera

12:31.084 --> 12:33.118
Aimed at where he died...

12:33.120 --> 12:34.686
Had been disabled.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.455
Uh, how about an
id on the victim?

12:37.457 --> 12:38.957
Is there anything
like that?

12:38.959 --> 12:40.525
You know what,
you're gonna have to see

12:40.527 --> 12:42.527
The boss
on that one.

12:42.529 --> 12:46.131
I was hoping we could do this
in a more unofficial capacity.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.198
So, kind of, like, out of the...

12:47.200 --> 12:48.800
The goodness of my heart
capacity?

12:48.802 --> 12:51.136
Oh, come on, we're all
on the same team here.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.504
(short chuckle)

12:55.274 --> 12:56.307
All right.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.110
He had some prints on file.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.579
Robert mccombs, age 45,

13:01.581 --> 13:04.149
Former marine,
had some mental health issues.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.151
Spent most of his time
in a hospital,

13:06.153 --> 13:07.285
The rest on the street.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.554
He was crazy?

13:09.556 --> 13:10.989
Yeah, yeah, he was crazy.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.892
Kind of like syd barrett, mate.

13:16.562 --> 13:18.329
So why do you want to know?

13:18.331 --> 13:21.900
Um, I'm not authorized to say.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.344
(phone rings)

13:35.815 --> 13:38.149
Aiden, hi.
Hey, dad.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.251
How are you?
Mom said I could
call you if I wanted.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.419
Well, I'm glad you did.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.354
(chuckles)

13:43.356 --> 13:45.523
Listen, I-I'm sorry
about the other night.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.926
I was out of line
and I know it's no excuse,

13:47.928 --> 13:50.195
But I'm sorry,

13:50.197 --> 13:52.363
Anyway.
You should get mom
some new dishes.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.531
Yeah, I think you're right.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.099
(laughs)

13:55.101 --> 13:57.468
Listen, um,

13:57.470 --> 13:59.370
How about, uh,

13:59.372 --> 14:01.639
How about we go shopping,
then, huh?

14:01.641 --> 14:03.541
I'll take you out for dinner.
F-Friday?

14:03.543 --> 14:05.844
I got to check my schedule.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.478
Should probably ask mom, too.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.214
But I'll make her say yes.
Okay.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.549
I-I'll see you then.
See you.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.252
Love you, son.
Love you, too.

14:26.232 --> 14:27.866
Oh, god, no.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.335
(grunting)

14:30.337 --> 14:33.037
(grunts)

14:33.039 --> 14:35.874
No.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.075
Aah!

14:37.077 --> 14:38.443
Now you make the vx.

14:40.079 --> 14:41.880
(groans)

14:41.882 --> 14:43.414
No.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.049
No, I won't do it.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.818
I won't do it, do you hear me?

14:46.820 --> 14:48.419
Do you hear me?

14:48.421 --> 14:50.922
I won't make your weapon.
I won't.

14:50.924 --> 14:54.259
Oh, but I think
you will, alexander.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.661
Alexander nevelsky.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.730
Colonel?

15:00.933 --> 15:02.033
Yuri.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.768
You're a smart man

15:03.770 --> 15:08.006
Who knows he shouldn't
waste his true talent.

15:09.341 --> 15:12.343
You said you
wouldn't hurt them.

15:22.788 --> 15:25.523
Your chemicals
are on the way, doctor.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.825
Yuri.

15:36.969 --> 15:39.304
Troy:
My guy's name is nic.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.806
He can get kind of jumpy,
so let me deal with him.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.275
Jumpy?
Cocaine's a hell of a drug.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.710
Ah. Might've mentioned
that earlier.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.912
He's troy's ci.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.480
Just let him handle it.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.819
â™ª

16:06.832 --> 16:09.233
(laughs)

16:09.235 --> 16:11.836
There he is, huh?
The money man.

16:11.838 --> 16:15.073
Oh.
(growling laugh)

16:15.075 --> 16:17.008
Crystal scott.
Grand royal bank.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.242
Mmm.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.244
She handles
all my accounts in the caymans.

16:20.246 --> 16:23.014
(laughs)
I bet you do
handle things.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.350
Huh?
(chuckles)

16:25.352 --> 16:27.018
Who's he?
Crystal: That's martin.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.420
He's with me.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.756
Okay.
Let's, uh, let's
talk in your office.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.257
Yeah, of course.

16:39.865 --> 16:41.366
The hell
you doing

16:41.368 --> 16:42.700
Bringing two cops in here?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.602
You're gonna get me killed.
Nic, shut up.

16:44.604 --> 16:48.539
Respect some basic rules, man.
We want information.
There was a kidnapping in

16:48.541 --> 16:50.341
Bakersfield.
We think chechen mafia

16:50.343 --> 16:52.043
Pulled the job.
How am I supposed to know
anything about that?

16:52.045 --> 16:54.045
You're tuned into those guys.
Tuned in?

16:54.047 --> 16:56.347
Maybe I hear some things
now and then. Heard zero about

16:56.349 --> 16:57.782
The kidnapping
the obshina pulled.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.618
Sorry you wasted a trip. Try
calling next time. Now get out.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.120
Cut the shit, nic.
What do you want from me?

17:02.122 --> 17:04.222
Those guys scare me
a lot more than you do. So

17:04.224 --> 17:05.556
I have nothing to say.

17:05.558 --> 17:06.624
Anything
comes back to me,

17:06.626 --> 17:07.892
You'll be talking
to a dead man.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.794
Well, let's try that.
(grunts)

17:15.367 --> 17:17.301
One bullet.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.471
Talk to a dead man.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.806
Piss off.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.908
What are you doing?
You russians.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.911
Something about the
way you play roulette,

17:26.913 --> 17:29.414
It's... It's just not sporting.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.749
Game's over
too fast.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.151
You only get to play once.

17:34.086 --> 17:35.553
(whimpers)
what the hell, man?

17:35.555 --> 17:37.422
Martin.
This way...

17:37.424 --> 17:39.824
We can play twice.

17:40.492 --> 17:42.660
Oh, god.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.997
Oh!

17:45.999 --> 17:48.499
Troy:
Martin, cool it.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.102
Future progeny on the line.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.770
I like that.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.773
Dimitri.
Yeah, dimitri.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.775
Dimitri who?
I don't know his last name.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.610
He came in last night,
he dropped a lot of cash.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.345
H-he mentioned
bakersfield.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.414
I said I'd seen it
on the news, and he nodded.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.283
That's it. I swear.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.851
Well...

18:06.853 --> 18:08.453
We don't have all day.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.822
Let's go
find dimitri.

18:17.963 --> 18:19.964
This guy's
taking forever.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.800
Hope dimitri's not smart
enough to bust him.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.269
No more of that
cowboy shit.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.971
Like the roulette routine.

18:26.973 --> 18:29.941
The gun
wasn't loaded.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.076
I just made you believe it was.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.411
Loaded or not--

18:33.413 --> 18:35.379
If it happens again
I'm going to gates.

18:35.381 --> 18:38.583
You think the rules apply
to men like dimitri?

18:38.585 --> 18:40.084
Huh? Or the founding father?

18:40.086 --> 18:43.054
It's not the point.
No, it's exactly the point.

18:43.056 --> 18:45.323
If we have a loose
chemical weapon in l.A.,

18:45.325 --> 18:47.091
It doesn't matter
what rules we follow.

18:47.093 --> 18:49.427
Cameras are live.
You're all set.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.462
(engine starts)
maggie,

18:51.464 --> 18:53.064
Cameras are live.

18:53.066 --> 18:54.098
Maggie:
Thanks, crystal.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.766
A/v signal online.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.269
We are... Eyes up.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.138
Dimitri groshkov.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.606
Chechen mob
enforcer, suspected

19:01.608 --> 19:02.940
In two murders.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.109
Wonder why he's still single.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.811
It's him.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.246
Who?

19:08.248 --> 19:09.614
The officer from
the dash cam video.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.115
One of the
kidnappers.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.017
Maggie, pull up
the footage of...
Already on it, sir.

19:15.254 --> 19:16.687
Not the shooter, the other one.

19:24.296 --> 19:27.298
72%-- I can work
with those odds. People.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.200
That's our suspect.

19:30.802 --> 19:32.503
Crystal:
<i>Should we bring dimitri in?</i>

19:32.505 --> 19:34.438
No, dimitri would just lawyer up

19:34.440 --> 19:36.974
And we wouldn't be any closer
to finding the family.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.509
Anything from the
records sweep?

19:38.511 --> 19:40.845
Maggie data-mined
his e-mail and phone records,

19:40.847 --> 19:42.313
But there was no mention
of the hubbards.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.949
We could try to, uh,
provoke dimitri,

19:44.951 --> 19:47.351
Have him reach out to his
handlers about the kidnapping.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.786
Provoke him how?

19:48.788 --> 19:50.121
Use troy's ci.

19:50.123 --> 19:52.623
Have him invite dimitri
to the club tonight.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.225
This guy is mob muscle.

19:54.227 --> 19:57.161
He yearns for status, respect.

19:57.163 --> 20:00.331
Have spencer holt

20:00.333 --> 20:02.633
Offer his services.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.168
It could spook him.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.003
Then we'll offer him
an incentive to show up.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.672
An incentive?
I hear

20:07.674 --> 20:10.374
Spencer's banker is in town.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.343
You up for it?

20:12.345 --> 20:13.811
That sounds good.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.179
I think it's our best option.

20:15.181 --> 20:16.681
Gates:
Considering the
level of threat

20:16.683 --> 20:18.983
And a victimized,
innocent family, I agree.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.352
Get an operational plan
on my desk in one hour.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.653
Martin?

20:22.655 --> 20:24.722
Give me a minute.

20:26.024 --> 20:27.592
What's up?

20:27.594 --> 20:30.328
When we cleaned up
bobby mehta's computer,

20:30.330 --> 20:34.198
We found some off-book files
for your eyes only.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.267
Who is he?

20:38.704 --> 20:40.705
Mccombs:
<i>You really think</i>

20:40.707 --> 20:41.872
You're martin odum?

20:41.874 --> 20:43.007
There is no martin odum.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.008
Who am I?

20:44.010 --> 20:45.743
(shouting):
Who am I?!

20:46.712 --> 20:49.046
You've known me
almost eight years.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.681
You can't trust me?

20:54.019 --> 20:56.020
His name's...

20:56.022 --> 20:58.522
Robert mccombs.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.258
He's homeless,
mentally ill.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.726
He'd been
following me.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.728
I asked bobby to id him.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.796
Right after bobby died,

21:05.798 --> 21:08.032
Mccombs was murdered.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.967
And you think bobby's death
was somehow connected?

21:09.969 --> 21:11.235
He told me

21:11.237 --> 21:13.571
I'm not who I think I am.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.440
That I'm somebody else.

21:16.442 --> 21:19.110
That martin odum
is just a legend.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.112
You believed him?

21:21.114 --> 21:23.080
I know he
was crazy.

21:23.082 --> 21:26.817
He just seemed, uh...

21:26.819 --> 21:30.087
Convincing.

21:30.089 --> 21:32.089
What mccombs said--

21:32.091 --> 21:36.093
Don't mention that
to anyone else in the office.

21:36.095 --> 21:38.629
Yeah.

21:42.167 --> 21:46.337
Martin... You wouldn't be
the first undercover agent

21:46.339 --> 21:48.406
To struggle
coming out of a case.

21:48.408 --> 21:52.777
I need you on active duty right
now, but when this is over,

21:52.779 --> 21:55.246
I want you
to take some personal time,

21:55.248 --> 21:57.315
Get your head together.

21:59.618 --> 22:02.119
Yeah.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.255
Here.

22:04.257 --> 22:06.757
There you go. Excuse me.

22:10.762 --> 22:13.164
(sniffing)

22:15.133 --> 22:18.336
Taco?
No, thanks.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.338
What do you want,
agent rice?

22:20.340 --> 22:21.806
You know,
I have some more information

22:21.808 --> 22:23.607
About that murder victim
you were asking me about.

22:23.609 --> 22:25.309
Robert mccombs?

22:25.311 --> 22:26.977
Yeah?

22:26.979 --> 22:28.779
Yeah. Yeah, you know, the lapd--

22:28.781 --> 22:30.481
They found
a couple more witnesses.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.616
They were actually
on that platform

22:32.618 --> 22:34.452
The night mccombs got stabbed.

22:34.454 --> 22:35.820
A matter of fact,

22:35.822 --> 22:38.956
One of them even had some video.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.998
Why didn't you tell me
you were there?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.501
Um, uh...
And what was that
you took from him? Was that a...

22:50.503 --> 22:51.702
Was that a book?
What was that?

22:51.704 --> 22:54.171
I can't talk
about an ongoing investigation.

22:54.173 --> 22:56.006
You know, uh...
Now, see, that hurts me, martin.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.975
Yeah, 'cause you said

22:57.977 --> 23:00.177
That we were both
on the same team, remember?

23:00.179 --> 23:01.379
What you were doing there?

23:01.381 --> 23:03.948
Were you working undercover
on a case? What?

23:05.350 --> 23:07.351
I didn't kill him.

23:07.353 --> 23:09.387
Who did?
I don't know.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.589
You don't know this
about me yet,

23:11.591 --> 23:13.924
But I don't drop the ball.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.993
I do not fumble.

23:18.196 --> 23:19.563
Oh, god.

23:19.565 --> 23:20.731
Oh, richard.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.199
(richard groans)
oh, jane, help me.

23:22.201 --> 23:23.367
Get him onto the couch.

23:23.369 --> 23:24.668
(door rumbles shut)

23:24.670 --> 23:26.036
I'll get a washcloth.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.371
(richard groaning)

23:27.373 --> 23:29.573
(water running)

23:29.575 --> 23:31.041
Why are they doing this to us?

23:31.043 --> 23:33.711
What do they want?
They want me.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.679
Oh, want you for what?

23:35.681 --> 23:37.782
Who are you?

23:37.784 --> 23:40.284
I used to be a chemist
for the russian military.

23:42.053 --> 23:43.687
I used to make weapons.

23:43.689 --> 23:44.855
Terrible,

23:44.857 --> 23:45.923
Destructive things.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.928
You told me
you taught at a university.

23:50.930 --> 23:54.365
I wanted to leave
alexander nevelsky in the past.

23:54.367 --> 23:55.900
It was an
immoral life.

23:55.902 --> 23:57.234
That's why I fled.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.769
I knew when
I met you

23:58.771 --> 24:00.404
That my life would be saved.

24:00.406 --> 24:03.741
And you did.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.276
You saved my life.

24:07.412 --> 24:08.746
(gasps)

24:08.748 --> 24:11.315
I'm gonna get us out
of here, I promise.

24:20.325 --> 24:21.792
Maggie, can you hear me?

24:21.794 --> 24:24.161
I hear ya.

24:24.163 --> 24:27.331
Be advised, troy says he will
meet you at the front door.

24:27.333 --> 24:30.000
Stay together.
Backup will be 30 seconds out.

24:30.002 --> 24:33.137
Remember, there's a lot
of innocent people at the club.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.805
Make our moves tactical
and precise.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.174
We know who our target is.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.243
I hope this works.

24:40.512 --> 24:42.413
Damn it.
This keeps popping open.

24:44.349 --> 24:47.551
(sighs)

24:48.487 --> 24:51.188
Let me help you.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.924
Your pulse is racing.

24:53.926 --> 24:56.427
Two shots of tequila
when you get in.

24:56.429 --> 24:58.195
Calm your nerves.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.097
Just fix the clasp.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.198
There you go.

25:02.267 --> 25:04.502
This isn't lap dances
and lingerie.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.203
This is the obshina.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.606
They make you,
they kill me and troy, too.

25:08.608 --> 25:11.041
No.
I need to know
you're up for this.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.376
Don't patronize me, martin.

25:12.378 --> 25:14.178
I'm not the
liability here.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.379
You're the guy
with the issues, not me.

25:15.381 --> 25:17.181
Ah.
At least the chechens
are predictable.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.516
You sure as hell aren't.

25:18.518 --> 25:20.584
Certainly hope not.

25:29.060 --> 25:31.061
Bourbon.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.630
Hmm?

25:32.632 --> 25:33.797
I don't like tequila.

25:34.799 --> 25:37.034
Shot of bourbon then.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.136
Might have one myself.

25:46.411 --> 25:48.779
(loud crowd chatter,
dance music playing)

26:02.160 --> 26:04.228
Hey, out, out.

26:05.430 --> 26:07.831
Up.

26:10.769 --> 26:12.670
Martin:
Here's our guy.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.042
Come.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.777
Have a seat.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.412
(mutters indistinctly)

26:21.414 --> 26:23.113
Target's inside.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.181
They're making their approach.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.283
Oh, here they are.
Hey, hey.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.752
Dimitri, meet
my special friend, spencer.

26:28.754 --> 26:29.787
Spencer holt.

26:29.789 --> 26:30.788
And his lovely associate

26:30.790 --> 26:31.789
Crystal.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.591
A pleasure.

26:33.593 --> 26:34.592
Welcome.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.260
Martin:
Troy's guy set a table.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.295
Target's engaged.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.097
Dimitri's got some muscle there.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.131
Three men,

26:41.133 --> 26:42.466
All armed.

26:43.702 --> 26:44.802
Oh.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.470
(sighs)

26:46.472 --> 26:49.440
(two beeps)

26:49.442 --> 26:50.774
Maggie:
We're tapped into the signal.

26:50.776 --> 26:51.642
Thanks, martin.

26:51.644 --> 26:52.643
Follow team?

26:52.645 --> 26:54.111
Man:
In position, standing by.

26:54.113 --> 26:54.945
Satellite's online, sir.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.747
Video's up.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.382
To life.
To life.
(laughter)

27:02.420 --> 27:04.421
I'm telling you, dima,

27:04.423 --> 27:05.756
Spence is like gandalf

27:05.758 --> 27:06.824
With money, okay?

27:06.826 --> 27:08.659
What, the shorty
with the hairy feet?

27:08.661 --> 27:09.793
(laughter)

27:09.795 --> 27:10.828
No, the...

27:10.830 --> 27:11.829
Uh, the wizard, man.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.163
You know, you
should come down

27:13.165 --> 27:14.331
To the caymans some time.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.499
I'll show you around.

27:15.501 --> 27:16.667
I'd like to.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.169
(laughs)

27:19.171 --> 27:21.672
Damn, I can't hear
myself think

27:21.674 --> 27:23.674
Over this music.
(laughter)

27:23.676 --> 27:27.177
Let's go
to nic's office, huh?

27:27.179 --> 27:28.846
Okay, let's go.
Let's go upstairs.

27:29.681 --> 27:32.016
(speaking russian)

27:32.018 --> 27:33.150
Martin:
They're moving into the back.

27:35.453 --> 27:36.854
I can't follow them.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.355
Maggie:
We're going to lose visual.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.923
We do not have eyes
in that back office.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.693
Dimitri:
No, man, I
think they could

27:42.695 --> 27:45.195
Help with our thing.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.331
Our operation.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.532
They move cash.

27:48.534 --> 27:50.701
Yeah. Offshore.

27:50.703 --> 27:53.303
I think you should get
the boss down here tonight.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.806
Good. I'll let them know.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.374
(speaking russian)

27:57.376 --> 27:59.843
Automated female voice:
No, it hasn't come up,

27:59.845 --> 28:02.479
But I'm telling you,

28:02.481 --> 28:06.050
They could help
with the bakersfield thing.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.484
(speaking russian)

28:07.486 --> 28:09.386
When that money drops
from the colonel...

28:09.388 --> 28:11.889
The colonel. Run
that through langley.

28:11.891 --> 28:14.525
Cross-reference with russian
military and organized crime

28:14.527 --> 28:16.560
Databases.
Maggie: I'm trying
to trace the call, sir,

28:16.562 --> 28:19.830
But it's going through
multiple exchanges. Tokyo.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.331
Shanghai,

28:21.333 --> 28:22.633
Istanbul, kiev?

28:22.635 --> 28:24.668
Pretty sophisticated tech
for the chechen mob.

28:24.670 --> 28:26.503
Who is this guy talking to?!

28:26.505 --> 28:27.671
I'm locking in, sir.

28:27.673 --> 28:28.572
Whoa.

28:28.574 --> 28:29.673
The signal's right here

28:29.675 --> 28:30.841
In the city.
Where?

28:30.843 --> 28:33.243
(trilling)
we didn't get it, sir.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.746
Crystal,

28:35.748 --> 28:37.214
We didn't get the trace.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.149
But we do know dimitri's boss,
the colonel,

28:39.151 --> 28:41.351
Is on the way
to the club right now.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.487
And, crystal, watch yourself.

28:46.257 --> 28:47.991
(whooping,
inhales through teeth)

28:50.428 --> 28:52.196
(laughing)
(laughs)

28:52.198 --> 28:54.531
You're drunk, girl.
(laughs)

28:54.533 --> 28:57.601
I'll only sleep with you if
you're for real, dimitri.

28:57.603 --> 28:59.703
It's bank policy.

28:59.705 --> 29:00.838
Dimitri:
Oh, I'm for real.
Crystal: Yeah?

29:00.840 --> 29:02.272
Dimitri:
Trust me.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.540
I just called my boss.

29:03.542 --> 29:05.342
He's gonna be here
any minute now.

29:05.344 --> 29:06.543
Crystal:
Mm.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.378
Well, I can't
wait to meet him.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.948
Oh, he can't wait
to meet you, too.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.083
We're gonna do
some business together.

29:13.085 --> 29:16.286
Oh. Will you excuse me
while I powder my nose?

29:16.288 --> 29:18.422
Mm.
(laughs)

29:42.814 --> 29:45.849
(chirping)

29:48.887 --> 29:50.621
Maggie, we've got visitors.

29:50.623 --> 29:51.822
Where's crystal

29:51.824 --> 29:52.990
And troy?
Maggie:
Troy is

29:52.992 --> 29:54.224
Still with the target,
and I've lost

29:54.226 --> 29:56.126
Crystal's signal.
I told you

29:56.128 --> 29:57.661
That we do not have eyes
in that back office.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.663
Oh, these guys aren't right.

29:59.665 --> 30:01.398
That's definitely not
dimitri's boss.

30:03.168 --> 30:04.535
I'm going up there.

30:09.007 --> 30:11.475
(gunfire)

30:11.477 --> 30:12.843
Oh, my god.
Follow team,

30:12.845 --> 30:13.811
Move in!

30:13.813 --> 30:15.679
(gunfire continues)

30:26.691 --> 30:27.925
(gunshot)
(grunts)

30:30.161 --> 30:32.396
(gunshots)

30:38.536 --> 30:39.536
Crystal?

30:39.538 --> 30:42.039
Crystal! Crystal!

30:46.177 --> 30:47.778
(panting)

30:52.116 --> 30:54.218
Troy. Troy.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.286
Crystal, come on!

30:59.224 --> 31:02.292
(gunshots)

31:05.797 --> 31:07.130
Come on!

31:07.132 --> 31:08.665
(siren wailing)
keep moving!

31:08.667 --> 31:09.967
Move!

31:19.911 --> 31:21.812
(tires screech)

31:23.882 --> 31:24.982
(tires screech)

31:39.264 --> 31:40.998
(tires screech)

31:41.000 --> 31:43.667
(indistinct chatter)

31:43.669 --> 31:45.402
(distant siren wailing)

31:51.276 --> 31:52.943
What's the count?
Seven dead.

31:52.945 --> 31:54.278
Our people?

31:54.280 --> 31:55.579
I can't find martin
and crystal.

31:55.581 --> 31:57.114
Maybe they got out.

31:57.116 --> 31:59.383
Sir...

31:59.385 --> 32:01.952
Troy's dead.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.691
Get this place
locked down.

32:07.693 --> 32:08.759
Nobody leaves.

32:08.761 --> 32:10.694
Yes, sir.
Everybody, I'm gonna need you

32:10.696 --> 32:12.462
To come inside the building
with me, please.

32:17.969 --> 32:20.037
What a goddamn mess.

32:22.707 --> 32:24.374
Yes, sir.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.009
He's ours.

32:27.245 --> 32:29.313
(phone rings)

32:31.916 --> 32:34.318
Martin, where are you?

32:34.320 --> 32:35.786
We're at my place.

32:35.788 --> 32:37.454
They got troy.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.991
I know.

32:40.993 --> 32:42.492
I'm sorry.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.461
How's crystal?

32:44.463 --> 32:46.129
She's okay.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.332
We got too close, so they had
to cut out the loose ends.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.067
Yeah, they sent
pros to do it, too.

32:50.069 --> 32:51.902
No way this is
just chechen mob.

32:51.904 --> 32:54.071
Someone else
is behind this thing, nelson.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.906
They're organized.

32:55.908 --> 32:58.008
They're financed.

32:58.010 --> 33:01.078
We're gonna get these guys,
martin.

33:21.165 --> 33:22.766
I'm gonna find out
who killed him

33:22.768 --> 33:25.268
And put a bullet in their head.

33:31.876 --> 33:34.878
Rice, you put in

33:34.880 --> 33:36.446
For surveillance
on an active fbi agent?

33:36.448 --> 33:37.681
Okay, hold on.
Before you get upset...

33:37.683 --> 33:39.549
Whatever excuse you got,
it does not supersede

33:39.551 --> 33:41.218
What I'm gonna catch
for this, tony.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.886
This guy comes to me asking me
about the murder,

33:42.888 --> 33:46.123
Okay? Completely just
misrepresenting his involvement.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.391
Oh, maybe he was working
undercover.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.226
Maybe it's none
of your business.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.694
Do me a favor,

33:50.696 --> 33:52.896
Don't mess with dco operations.

33:52.898 --> 33:54.965
I've got eyewitness video
of agent odum

33:54.967 --> 33:56.900
Standing over the victim
and then fleeing the scene.

33:56.902 --> 33:58.035
What am I gonna do with that?

33:58.037 --> 34:00.037
Stick it in a box,
send it upstairs to opr.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.572
You let them handle this.
Oh, no. Screw opr. This is
my case. I got this case.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.641
Your surveillance request
is denied.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.710
Turn what you have
over to opr.

34:14.352 --> 34:16.953
(dialing)

34:18.423 --> 34:21.258
Hey. Yeah, what's up? This is
tony over at transpo security.

34:21.260 --> 34:24.594
Yes, the boss signed off on it,
just like I told you she would.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.696
Of course.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.698
No, no. Don't wait, okay?

34:28.700 --> 34:31.068
She wants eyes
on this guy 24/7 right now.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.335
Yeah.

34:32.337 --> 34:34.337
Suspect's name?

34:34.339 --> 34:36.473
Martin odum.

34:55.259 --> 34:56.259
Hey.

34:56.261 --> 34:57.928
(clears throat)

34:57.930 --> 34:59.262
Oh, I'm sorry to bother you.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.964
No,
it's okay.

35:00.966 --> 35:03.200
What's the status?

35:03.202 --> 35:06.136
We pulled the data off
of dimitri's phones. Most of

35:06.138 --> 35:08.271
The numbers that he called were
dumped right after the shooting,

35:08.273 --> 35:11.274
So we didn't get anything.
W-what about the two gunmen
that came in the building?

35:11.276 --> 35:13.477
Russian mob. We turned it over
to organized crime.

35:13.479 --> 35:14.644
See if that gets us

35:14.646 --> 35:16.480
Up the ladder any.
Yeah.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.482
Thanks, maggie.
Mm-hmm.

35:18.484 --> 35:21.618
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.055
I... Didn't know
troy very well,

35:25.057 --> 35:27.124
But...

35:27.126 --> 35:29.025
Thank you.

35:37.335 --> 35:38.668
(exhales)

35:38.670 --> 35:40.237
Gates:
<i>This is a difficult time,</i>
<i>I know.</i>

35:40.239 --> 35:43.073
<i>But I need you to stay</i>
<i>focused.</i>

35:43.075 --> 35:45.575
We can grieve
when this is over.

35:46.511 --> 35:48.512
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt,

35:48.514 --> 35:51.748
But I just saw this
on the regional threat matrix.

35:51.750 --> 35:54.084
The burglary

35:54.086 --> 35:56.753
Happened last night
at a warehouse in san pedro.

35:56.755 --> 35:58.321
Those canisters contain

35:58.323 --> 35:59.956
Phosphorous trichloride.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.526
Those are the chemicals used
to produce vx gas.

36:24.649 --> 36:25.782
Dad.

36:29.153 --> 36:30.754
Jane: <i>Dad!</i>
<i>Susan:</i> <i>Richard!</i>

36:35.626 --> 36:36.726
Gates:
<i>We estimate a 72-hour window</i>
<i>before we have</i>

36:36.728 --> 36:40.197
An unsanctioned
vx chemical weapon on u.S. Soil.

36:40.199 --> 36:43.300
I need to go back under, nelson.

36:43.302 --> 36:45.135
It's too soon.

36:45.137 --> 36:46.870
The bureau's gonna put
a lot of agents on this,

36:46.872 --> 36:48.805
But you know they're not
gonna find this guy in time.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.476
Hubbard and his family are
dead if we don't move now.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.214
Who's the legend?

36:57.216 --> 37:01.084
Dante can pick up the trail of
a loose wmd faster than anyone.

37:01.086 --> 37:03.019
Dante auerbach.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.088
Lord of war.

37:05.090 --> 37:08.258
Okay,
martin.

37:08.260 --> 37:10.327
Let's do it.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.599
(doorbell rings)

37:17.335 --> 37:18.735
There you are.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.337
How was the park?
Awesome.

37:20.339 --> 37:21.671
And we have
a surprise for you.

37:21.673 --> 37:24.007
Yeah. A new set
of dishes.

37:24.009 --> 37:25.775
And an apology.

37:25.777 --> 37:28.278
Thanks.
You should
come with us

37:28.280 --> 37:29.679
Next time, mom. Dad,

37:29.681 --> 37:31.147
Okay with you
if mom joins us?

37:33.584 --> 37:35.452
Listen, aiden,

37:35.454 --> 37:38.355
Uh, I think we'd better
play next week by ear.

37:38.357 --> 37:39.856
There's a chance
I'll be out of town.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.524
Yeah, okay.

37:41.526 --> 37:42.959
Maybe some other time.

37:42.961 --> 37:45.128
Sure.
Aiden, honey, it's getting late.

37:45.130 --> 37:46.796
Come inside
and brush your teeth.

37:46.798 --> 37:47.964
Good night,
dad.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.699
Yeah, good night, son.

37:55.806 --> 37:57.374
Are you going under again?

37:58.376 --> 38:00.543
This is gonna kill you.

38:04.048 --> 38:06.116
(door creaks closed)

38:06.118 --> 38:07.851
(sighs)

38:10.988 --> 38:13.490
All right,
that tracker's working.

38:13.492 --> 38:15.225
I'll follow him tonight.

38:18.162 --> 38:20.897
Got it?

38:39.750 --> 38:41.818
(tires screeching)
(horn honks)

38:45.022 --> 38:46.523
Where'd he go?

38:46.525 --> 38:48.291
Come on. Talk to me.

38:48.293 --> 38:50.593
Looks like he did a u-turn.
What?

38:51.762 --> 38:55.532
I got him increasing speed
on victory.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.375
Where the hell did he go?

39:05.377 --> 39:07.544
We've got a weapons-grade
nerve agent out there,

39:07.546 --> 39:10.547
Which is why the op has been
escalated to level one priority.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.949
Half the city is
in the kill zone. My god.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.050
We're facing
the possibility

39:14.052 --> 39:16.386
Of mass casualties
on a domestic target.

39:16.388 --> 39:19.856
Quantico expects dco
to prevent an attack

39:19.858 --> 39:23.193
Like that here. And right now
we've got no solid leads,

39:23.195 --> 39:25.562
And we have to pull out
all the stops.

39:25.564 --> 39:28.465
This is probably
martin's most productive legend.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.734
Dante auerbach.

39:30.736 --> 39:34.804
<i>British arms dealer, playboy,</i>
<i>death merchant</i>

39:34.806 --> 39:35.805
And lord of war.

39:35.807 --> 39:36.806
<i>Raised in council housing</i>

39:36.808 --> 39:38.074
<i>In liverpool.</i>

39:38.076 --> 39:39.743
<i>Oxford on scholarship,</i>

39:39.745 --> 39:42.912
<i>Dropped out at 19</i>
<i>to volunteer for afghanistan.</i>

39:42.914 --> 39:45.648
(gunshots)

39:45.650 --> 39:47.384
<i>Booted from her majesty's</i>
<i>for bootlegging whiskey</i>

39:47.386 --> 39:48.918
At bagram.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.086
That's charming.

39:50.088 --> 39:51.588
Later maintained an entire fleet
of cargo planes,

39:51.590 --> 39:52.922
<i>Supplying arms,</i>

39:52.924 --> 39:54.991
Antibiotics and ammunition
to both sides

39:54.993 --> 39:56.426
Of the bosnia-serbian war.

39:56.428 --> 39:58.395
The role plays to his strengths.

39:58.397 --> 40:01.598
<i>Dante is a talker,</i>
<i>a convincer, a gambler.</i>

40:01.600 --> 40:03.266
<i>Dante has an associate</i>

40:03.268 --> 40:05.769
He swears has a strong lead
on the vx sale.

40:05.771 --> 40:09.339
Thinks his guy can get us the
supplier and nevelsky's captors.

40:09.341 --> 40:10.440
Sit back and watch.

40:10.442 --> 40:13.410
It's his show now.

40:17.948 --> 40:21.184
Nice to have you with
us again, mr. Auerbach.
