WEBVTT

00:02.375 --> 00:03.250
-NARRATOR: Tonight...
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

00:03.375 --> 00:04.875
...on <i>Beyond Oak Island...</i>

00:05.000 --> 00:06.375
BILL:
There's oral traditions that

00:06.500 --> 00:07.833
have been passed down
of an oak-bottom pond

00:07.958 --> 00:09.167
on Oderin Island.

00:09.292 --> 00:10.750
He got a hit.
Yeah, he's got timber.

00:10.875 --> 00:12.833
-Whoa.
-This might be a hidden location

00:13.000 --> 00:15.250
where Peter Easton
stashed a treasure.

00:15.375 --> 00:16.875
BILL:
We might have some information

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
on an authentic
Peter Easton shipwreck.

00:18.125 --> 00:19.667
-Wow.
-This sounds fabulous.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.500
-MATTY: Eyes and fins.
-MARTY: Find us a ship, Tony.

00:23.708 --> 00:25.833
We're after a legend
and we're after a treasure.

00:25.958 --> 00:27.500
Right next to that pond.

00:31.833 --> 00:33.250
(cheering)

00:35.167 --> 00:36.708
All the while
we were growing up,

00:36.833 --> 00:40.250
my brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.292
RICK:
Pirate treasure,

00:42.417 --> 00:43.875
cursed treasure.

00:44.042 --> 00:45.625
Civil War gold.

00:45.750 --> 00:48.500
-(laughter)
-Since then,
our work on Oak Island

00:48.583 --> 00:50.917
has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:51.042 --> 00:53.708
-Whoa.
-...waiting to be explored.

00:53.833 --> 00:56.792
RICK:
So, we like to reach out
to other treasure hunters.

00:56.917 --> 00:59.125
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:59.208 --> 01:01.333
-MARTY: We want to hear
their stories...
-That's right.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.875
-...and share our insights.
-"Ill-gotten gains."

01:04.000 --> 01:05.250
-RICK: And who knows...
-GARY: I got it.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.042
...maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:07.208 --> 01:08.792
MARTY:
Not only in America.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.458
Wow. That is gold.

01:10.583 --> 01:12.333
-RICK: But all over the world.
-Yeah!

01:12.417 --> 01:14.292
MARTY:
<i>Beyond Oak Island.</i>

01:24.292 --> 01:25.583
MARTY:
Matty Blake,

01:25.708 --> 01:27.708
we are in a pretty
country right now, sir.

01:27.875 --> 01:31.667
Man, this is some of the most
beautiful area I've ever seen

01:31.833 --> 01:33.958
in the world. I thought it
last year when your brother

01:34.083 --> 01:35.667
-and I came to Newfoundland.
-Yeah.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.125
Oh, Rick gushed about it.

01:37.208 --> 01:38.500
He just... he just
loved Newfoundland.

01:38.625 --> 01:40.500
I'm just seeing it now,
but I-I agree.

01:40.625 --> 01:43.167
NARRATOR:
In Placentia Bay, Newfoundland,

01:43.333 --> 01:45.500
Marty Lagina and Matty Blake

01:45.625 --> 01:47.417
are on their way
to meet with Bill Smith,

01:47.542 --> 01:50.917
a researcher who believes
he has found the location

01:51.042 --> 01:53.333
of buried treasure
connected to the infamous

01:53.458 --> 01:56.792
17th century pirate
Peter Easton.

01:56.875 --> 02:00.417
We are once again hot
on the trail of Peter Easton,

02:00.542 --> 02:01.875
your... one of your
favorite characters.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.042
I'm very excited
about this, Matty,

02:03.208 --> 02:05.167
because this guy, he was

02:05.292 --> 02:08.500
probably the most
successful pirate ever.

02:08.583 --> 02:11.333
Took on the English Navy,
for goodness' sake.

02:11.458 --> 02:13.250
Called him the Pirate Admiral.

02:13.375 --> 02:16.083
Plundered several
Spanish galleons.

02:16.208 --> 02:17.917
But then he knew when to quit.

02:18.042 --> 02:19.208
Yes.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.583
NARRATOR:
Born in England, Peter Easton

02:23.708 --> 02:26.000
was an esteemed admiral
in the English Navy

02:26.125 --> 02:27.875
who became one of the Crown's

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
most valuable assets
in North America

02:30.083 --> 02:32.792
during the early 17th century.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.292
DUMOND:
In 1602, Queen Elizabeth

02:36.375 --> 02:39.667
commissioned Peter Easton
to be a privateer

02:39.833 --> 02:41.000
in the Royal Navy,

02:41.125 --> 02:42.833
and sent him to Newfoundland

02:42.958 --> 02:44.458
to protect the fishing fleets.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.167
NARRATOR:
As a privateer, meaning
he was a naval officer

02:48.292 --> 02:50.000
with the authority
to plunder ships

02:50.125 --> 02:52.167
belonging to rival nations,

02:52.333 --> 02:55.125
Peter Easton amassed
a sizeable fortune

02:55.208 --> 02:57.125
and earned the loyalty
of thousands of men

02:57.250 --> 02:58.250
under his command.

02:58.375 --> 03:01.375
However, after just two years,

03:01.500 --> 03:04.708
the British Crown
outlawed privateering.

03:04.875 --> 03:07.708
DUMOND:
In 1604, when
King James essentially

03:07.833 --> 03:10.583
made privateering illegal,
Easton had a choice to make.

03:10.708 --> 03:13.125
He could go home,

03:13.208 --> 03:16.000
forfeit everything
that he has acquired,

03:16.083 --> 03:18.333
or he could continue
doing what he was doing,

03:18.458 --> 03:20.667
cut the Crown out,
and keep everything

03:20.750 --> 03:21.917
for himself and his crew.

03:22.042 --> 03:23.208
He made the choice
that he was going to

03:23.375 --> 03:25.042
continue doing
what he was doing:

03:25.208 --> 03:27.083
ravage the seas worldwide,

03:27.208 --> 03:29.000
taking as many
ships as he could.

03:30.333 --> 03:33.292
NARRATOR:
With an established base
of operations in Newfoundland

03:33.375 --> 03:34.875
and with a loyal crew

03:35.042 --> 03:37.833
of more than
5,000 men and 40 ships,

03:38.000 --> 03:39.750
Peter Easton became

03:39.875 --> 03:42.583
one of the most successful
pirates in history.

03:42.708 --> 03:46.542
SIMON:
In terms for other pirates,
Peter Easton kind of set a bar

03:46.708 --> 03:50.292
in that he really showed how
a pirate could be successful,

03:50.417 --> 03:54.000
especially by attacking
other very powerful nations.

03:54.083 --> 03:56.167
A pirate could
command his own fleet

03:56.292 --> 03:58.208
and could retire wealthy

03:58.333 --> 04:00.333
and powerful in his own way.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.875
NARRATOR:
In 1612, Easton
made an agreement

04:04.042 --> 04:05.333
with the Duke of Savoy

04:05.458 --> 04:07.667
to end his lawless plunder

04:07.792 --> 04:09.208
on the high seas.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.083
In exchange for a full pardon

04:11.208 --> 04:13.875
and yearly payments of Â£4,000,

04:14.042 --> 04:15.167
he dismissed his crew,

04:15.250 --> 04:17.125
married a wealthy heiress,

04:17.250 --> 04:19.750
and retired
as an esteemed nobleman.

04:21.208 --> 04:24.000
SIMON:
What did he do with all these
goods and all these cash?

04:24.125 --> 04:26.750
It's possible he may have
also offloaded some of the cash

04:26.875 --> 04:29.833
in Newfoundland,
but it's never been found,

04:29.958 --> 04:31.875
and this is one of the things
that has made Peter Easton

04:32.000 --> 04:35.125
such a fascinating figure,
because not only has he set

04:35.250 --> 04:37.000
a massive gold
standard for piracy

04:37.125 --> 04:39.542
but he amassed
a massive fortune,

04:39.708 --> 04:42.958
and a lot of it is a mystery
as to where it went.

04:44.625 --> 04:46.542
MATTY:
To see, last year,
with your brother Rick,

04:46.708 --> 04:50.042
the geography, uh,
of Harbour Grace...

04:50.208 --> 04:52.000
-Mm-hmm.
-...and how Easton

04:52.167 --> 04:54.542
used that geography
to his advantage.

04:54.667 --> 04:56.042
There are all
these little shoals

04:56.208 --> 04:57.500
and places where
you can hide a ship.

04:57.625 --> 04:58.750
You could go around
the backside and hide,

04:58.875 --> 05:00.417
and so it all made sense.

05:00.542 --> 05:02.125
MATTY:
Permission
to come aboard, Captain?

05:02.250 --> 05:03.500
Hey, come aboard.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.375
NARRATOR:
In 2021, Matty,

05:05.542 --> 05:07.083
along with Rick Lagina,

05:07.208 --> 05:09.458
traveled to Harbour Grace,
Newfoundland.

05:09.583 --> 05:12.000
There, they joined
diver Tony Sampson...

05:12.125 --> 05:13.292
Hey, good to see you, brother.

05:13.375 --> 05:15.000
...his friend Bill Smith,

05:15.167 --> 05:16.708
and their team,
to search for a ship

05:16.875 --> 05:19.000
believed to have been
from Peter Easton's fleet,

05:19.125 --> 05:21.333
which sank in early 1612

05:21.458 --> 05:23.833
during a battle with
Basque Spanish pirates.

05:27.458 --> 05:28.333
We have a cannon,
we have a cannon.

05:28.417 --> 05:29.417
That's what he just said.

05:29.542 --> 05:31.458
NARRATOR:
Although the team

05:31.583 --> 05:34.625
investigated two cannons, which
archaeologist Scarlett Janusas

05:34.750 --> 05:37.042
believed could have
possibly been connected

05:37.208 --> 05:38.792
-to Peter Easton...
-Well done, guys!

05:38.875 --> 05:41.250
-MATTY: Wow.
-...no valuables were found.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.375
This is going to be

05:43.542 --> 05:44.625
-an awesome adventure.
-Yes, sir.

05:44.708 --> 05:46.625
NARRATOR:
Now, Marty and Matty

05:46.708 --> 05:49.500
have returned to rejoin
Bill and Tony for a search

05:49.625 --> 05:51.667
at a new location,
where Bill believes

05:51.792 --> 05:54.000
much of Peter Easton's
missing riches

05:54.125 --> 05:55.333
remain hidden today.

05:55.458 --> 05:57.333
Last year we were
in Harbour Grace.

05:57.417 --> 06:00.417
We're now kind of around
the bay, as they say,

06:00.542 --> 06:02.500
we're in a totally different
part of Newfoundland.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.500
Peter Easton again,
but a new part of the story.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.875
You know, we could be
talking that this guy

06:08.000 --> 06:09.750
had several billion dollars

06:09.875 --> 06:11.167
-in today's...
-Billion with a "B."

06:11.250 --> 06:12.292
-With a "B."
-Yeah, not... Yeah.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.667
That's incredible.

06:13.792 --> 06:15.083
Which means it would
have been nothing

06:15.208 --> 06:17.500
-to leave 500 million behind.
-Right.

06:17.625 --> 06:19.250
Well, I think
we're almost there.

06:19.375 --> 06:21.083
I can't wait
to see Bill and Tony.

06:21.208 --> 06:22.417
Yeah.

06:22.542 --> 06:23.917
I think it would be hard

06:24.042 --> 06:25.375
to overestimate the magnitude

06:25.500 --> 06:28.625
of Peter Easton's
potential treasure

06:28.708 --> 06:31.375
because he's rumored,
or maybe more than rumored,

06:31.500 --> 06:33.458
to have taken
all kinds of ships,

06:33.583 --> 06:35.333
including at least
three Spanish galleons.

06:35.458 --> 06:37.000
I think I see 'em down there.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.292
MARTY:
Some of the known
sunken Spanish galleons

06:39.417 --> 06:42.250
are reported to be worth
several billion each.

06:42.375 --> 06:44.292
So, I think his fortune

06:44.375 --> 06:46.208
was enormous
by today's standards.

06:46.333 --> 06:49.375
-Aw, geez, look who's here.
-Scallywags.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.000
Hey, brother, how are you doing?

06:51.083 --> 06:52.833
Good to see you.
Good to see you. Welcome back.

06:52.958 --> 06:55.000
My name is Bill Smith.

06:55.083 --> 06:56.833
I'm a chiropractor in practice

06:56.958 --> 06:59.333
for about 25 years
in Nova Scotia,

06:59.500 --> 07:02.000
and I'm a pirate researcher.

07:02.167 --> 07:05.500
My fascination with Peter Easton
started about 25 years ago.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.875
I was living in Toronto,

07:08.042 --> 07:09.333
and I was going to school,

07:09.458 --> 07:10.083
and I couldn't afford
to go home for Christmas,

07:10.208 --> 07:11.500
and I was given a book

07:11.667 --> 07:13.000
called <i>As Near to Heaven by Sea</i>

07:13.083 --> 07:15.333
by a fellow named Kevin Major.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.583
And there's a story
about Peter Easton,

07:17.708 --> 07:20.083
and I started reading
and I haven't stopped since.

07:20.208 --> 07:21.792
Well, guys, welcome back

07:21.875 --> 07:23.667
to-to Newfoundland,
and Marty for the first time.

07:23.792 --> 07:25.208
-First time, yeah.
-Yeah.

07:25.375 --> 07:26.750
I should call it,
uh, "Eastonland."

07:26.875 --> 07:28.750
-MARTY: "Eastonland."
-...what we're going to now.

07:28.875 --> 07:30.417
So, guys, we're in a different
part of the province this time.

07:30.542 --> 07:31.875
We were in Harbour Grace
last time.

07:32.042 --> 07:33.625
This time we're in a place
called Placentia Bay,

07:33.750 --> 07:36.708
and we're going to go
to, uh, Oderin Island,

07:36.875 --> 07:39.500
-which is a
Peter Easton hideout.
-Mm-hmm.

07:39.667 --> 07:43.542
NARRATOR:
Located some 100 miles
east of Harbour Grace,

07:43.708 --> 07:47.708
Oderin Island is a remote,
1,200-acre land mass

07:47.833 --> 07:50.333
known by historians
to have been a location

07:50.417 --> 07:52.625
where Peter Easton established

07:52.708 --> 07:56.542
one of his strongholds
during the early 17th century.

07:56.708 --> 07:59.833
Although it was once home
to several hundred residents,

07:59.917 --> 08:03.333
today it is
virtually uninhabited.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.833
BILL:
The target is
a mysterious pond

08:05.917 --> 08:07.667
on the north end
of Oderin Island.

08:07.833 --> 08:11.125
It's about 114 feet long,
65 feet wide,

08:11.208 --> 08:14.333
and some accounts say that
it goes down as much as 18 feet

08:14.458 --> 08:15.958
to these oak-bottom planks.

08:16.083 --> 08:18.792
And there's historical accounts,
there's written accounts,

08:18.875 --> 08:21.083
and there's oral traditions
that have been passed down

08:21.208 --> 08:22.500
through hundreds of years

08:22.583 --> 08:24.792
of an oak-bottom pond
on Oderin Island.

08:24.917 --> 08:28.083
There's no oak that's
indigenous to this area,

08:28.208 --> 08:29.542
and an oak-bottom pond,

08:29.708 --> 08:32.833
it could be related
to a buried treasure.

08:32.917 --> 08:34.875
The other thing they talk
about are flood tunnels

08:35.042 --> 08:37.417
which never allow
this pond to drain.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.750
So it's being protected
for some reason.

08:39.875 --> 08:41.958
Uh, Captain John Murphy here

08:42.042 --> 08:44.458
is from Oderin Island.

08:44.542 --> 08:45.708
Was there pirate lore

08:45.875 --> 08:47.083
about the island
that you heard as a kid?

08:57.667 --> 08:59.292
-Okay, what are we waiting for?
-Let's go.

08:59.375 --> 09:00.250
Let's get up to that island.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.833
Let's go get it.

09:02.958 --> 09:05.500
I think it's almost
always the case

09:05.583 --> 09:07.208
on treasure hunts that
you're chasing a legend.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.833
So, the legend is,
there's a pond,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.167
it's really hard to drain,
it supposedly

09:12.250 --> 09:13.667
has oak planks.

09:13.833 --> 09:16.000
We're going to find out
all about that, that's...

09:16.167 --> 09:17.583
that's one of the reasons
Tony Sampson is joining us.

09:17.708 --> 09:19.917
We're going to see if
any of that stuff is true.

09:20.042 --> 09:21.750
Show us the way.

09:21.875 --> 09:23.917
NARRATOR:
Arriving on Oderin Island,
the team heads

09:24.042 --> 09:27.000
to a fishing hut at the home
of Captain John Murphy.

09:27.083 --> 09:28.750
Boy, this
is the real deal, Bill.

09:28.875 --> 09:30.583
BILL:
Yeah. Oh, guys,
the guys are here.

09:30.708 --> 09:32.917
-PRIESTLEY: Hey, how's it going?
-BILL: Come on in, guys.

09:33.042 --> 09:35.542
NARRATOR:
There, they are meeting
with lidar scanning experts

09:35.708 --> 09:37.333
Steve Priestley
and Jordan Bannister,

09:37.458 --> 09:38.833
who have recently conducted

09:38.958 --> 09:41.250
a survey of the mysterious pond

09:41.375 --> 09:43.292
in preparation
for Tony Sampson's

09:43.417 --> 09:45.167
investigative dive.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.750
BILL:
There's 400 years

09:46.875 --> 09:48.833
of oral tradition
and history that says that

09:48.917 --> 09:51.167
there's an oak-bottom
floor in this pond,

09:51.250 --> 09:52.583
and there's drainage tunnels,

09:52.708 --> 09:54.417
similar to what has been
reported on Oak Island.

09:54.542 --> 09:56.542
-Wow.
-So, we've invited
these guys in,

09:56.667 --> 09:58.333
uh, to see if we could find

09:58.458 --> 09:59.875
any anomalous structures.
And, Steve?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.833
So, yeah, we've been
out here the last little while

10:02.917 --> 10:04.167
with drone-based technologies

10:04.292 --> 10:05.792
using lidar scanning.

10:05.917 --> 10:09.750
NARRATOR:
Lidar, or laser imaging,
detection and ranging,

10:09.875 --> 10:12.167
works by emitting
rapid laser pulses

10:12.292 --> 10:14.333
that reflect off the ground.

10:14.417 --> 10:16.625
The collected data
is then processed

10:16.708 --> 10:19.375
to create a 3D model
of the target area,

10:19.542 --> 10:22.542
revealing natural,
as well as potentially

10:22.667 --> 10:24.500
man-made, features
near the surface

10:24.625 --> 10:27.042
that are not visible
to the naked eye.

10:27.208 --> 10:30.875
So, what we found originally
doing our lidar scan

10:31.000 --> 10:33.708
was, there's two
parallel lines that run

10:33.875 --> 10:37.167
from the mountain range
right up to the pond there.

10:37.333 --> 10:39.000
Those two parallel lines,

10:39.083 --> 10:40.833
they run in unison
with one another,

10:40.958 --> 10:44.667
and those are impressions
from the lidar survey alone.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.625
What we think that it might be
is, we think they might be

10:46.708 --> 10:48.083
some type of fill tubes

10:48.208 --> 10:49.917
from maybe a natural
spring or something

10:50.042 --> 10:52.583
-to keep that pond full
all the time.
-Hmm.

10:52.708 --> 10:55.667
We-we love the idea
because it fits the lore

10:55.833 --> 10:57.417
of these things
designed to keep this full.

10:57.542 --> 10:59.625
But rather from the sea, this
is coming from upland, right?

10:59.750 --> 11:01.833
-Absolutely.
-The idea would be

11:01.958 --> 11:03.917
that if somebody tried
to drain this little water

11:04.042 --> 11:05.833
to get to the bottom
of it, they couldn't do it

11:06.000 --> 11:07.375
because it would
keep filling from this.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.958
PRIESTLEY:
It would keep full,

11:09.083 --> 11:10.417
and the way those lines
are running parallel,

11:10.542 --> 11:12.125
-it's not normal.
They're man-made.
-No.

11:12.250 --> 11:14.125
It wouldn't be noticeable,
really, to the naked eye,

11:14.250 --> 11:16.000
and we've actually
scanned the entire island,

11:16.083 --> 11:17.500
and this is
the one major anomaly

11:17.667 --> 11:19.792
-that we found.
-Now I'm getting excited.

11:19.917 --> 11:21.917
-Yeah. Me, too.
-MATTY: We were hoping
to hear that.

11:22.042 --> 11:23.583
-MARTY: We really were.
-TONY: Shall we go
and get wet, then?

11:23.708 --> 11:26.000
-Yes, I think so.
-Targets. We have targets.

11:26.167 --> 11:29.167
MARTY:
All right, let's get after it.

11:33.750 --> 11:36.167
BILL: Okay, boys,
we're on the northeast side

11:36.250 --> 11:37.958
of Oderin Island.

11:38.042 --> 11:39.500
I know it's been
a bit of a walk,

11:39.625 --> 11:40.667
but we're gonna
head up this way now.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.458
We're coming up on

11:42.542 --> 11:45.750
the place that I've been
really excited to show you guys.

11:46.833 --> 11:49.167
NARRATOR:
On Oderin Island, some ten miles

11:49.292 --> 11:51.583
off the southern coast
of Newfoundland, Canada,

11:51.708 --> 11:53.500
researcher Bill Smith

11:53.667 --> 11:55.250
has led Marty Lagina,

11:55.375 --> 11:59.000
Matty Blake, and diver
Tony Sampson to a location

11:59.167 --> 12:02.042
rumored to contain
millions in looted treasure

12:02.208 --> 12:06.083
connected to the 17th century
English pirate Peter Easton.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.542
Oh, wow. This is it?

12:07.667 --> 12:08.292
-MARTY: This is it?
-BILL: This is it.

12:08.375 --> 12:09.708
MATTY:
Wow.

12:09.833 --> 12:11.333
BILL:
I believe that this is the pond

12:11.500 --> 12:14.375
that hides Peter Easton's
treasure from 400 years ago.

12:16.042 --> 12:17.625
MARTY:
Is there any doubt amongst,

12:17.708 --> 12:19.208
let's say,
conventional historians

12:19.333 --> 12:21.167
that Peter Easton
was here on this island,

12:21.250 --> 12:25.000
that he had this
as part of his dominion?

12:25.083 --> 12:27.000
There's a consensus
amongst all...

12:27.125 --> 12:28.833
all parties
that have been involved.

12:28.958 --> 12:30.125
The historical accounts
have been handed down.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.917
-Here?
-Verbal and oral traditions,

12:32.042 --> 12:33.792
plus the written accounts.

12:33.875 --> 12:37.833
And then, with some of
the finds in the local area,

12:37.958 --> 12:39.333
I'd say I'm 99% certain.

12:39.458 --> 12:40.958
-That's certainty?
-Yeah.

12:41.083 --> 12:42.750
-Conjecture is
what's in that pond.
-Yup.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.708
Mr. Conjecture,

12:44.833 --> 12:46.250
get suited up.

12:46.375 --> 12:47.667
Looks like I got
another pond, doesn't it?

12:47.792 --> 12:49.292
-MARTY: Yeah.
-MATTY: Yeah.

12:49.375 --> 12:52.375
MARTY:
The pond is exactly
as I pictured it,

12:52.542 --> 12:55.625
except that the island itself
is way more rugged and barren.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.667
If this pond is actually
lined with oak planks,

12:58.792 --> 13:00.500
well, for one thing,
look around.

13:00.625 --> 13:01.917
There are no oak trees here.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.083
That would mean
they were brought there

13:04.208 --> 13:05.833
specifically for some reason.

13:05.917 --> 13:08.583
I think if that
particular legend is true,

13:08.708 --> 13:10.375
that this pond
is lined with oak planks,

13:10.542 --> 13:11.667
I think we're on to something.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.333
NARRATOR:
While Tony investigates

13:13.500 --> 13:14.625
the muddy, shallow pond

13:14.750 --> 13:16.542
for signs of valuables,

13:16.667 --> 13:18.250
he will not only
attempt to confirm

13:18.375 --> 13:20.667
that the feature's bottom
is lined with oak planks,

13:20.792 --> 13:23.125
but he'll also look for evidence

13:23.208 --> 13:25.375
of possibly man-made
flood tunnels

13:25.500 --> 13:29.667
that Bill believes are connected
to a nearby natural spring.

13:29.792 --> 13:31.667
So, that anomaly
will be coming down

13:31.750 --> 13:33.708
here somewhere, feeding in.

13:33.833 --> 13:36.583
-Way over there.
-It stops abruptly
at the bottom of the hill.

13:36.708 --> 13:38.750
-MATTY: Got it.
-BILL: Just, it starts
and stops at the same spot,

13:38.875 --> 13:39.792
-which is really peculiar.
-MATTY: Wow.

13:39.875 --> 13:42.000
-Interesting.
-Yeah.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.667
There's no way something
should be there.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.292
MARTY:
There are so many legends about

13:45.417 --> 13:48.000
hiding things underwater,
and it-it appears to work.

13:48.125 --> 13:49.667
Let's do what we came here for.

13:49.833 --> 13:51.125
-MATTY: Let's go.
-TONY: Let's go.

13:51.208 --> 13:52.458
I'm impatient.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.167
-Mud diver.
-(Bill laughs)

13:54.292 --> 13:56.583
TONY:
I've heard so much
about this pond from Bill.

13:56.708 --> 13:58.750
I'm so excited
to get in this pond,

13:58.875 --> 14:00.500
and actually prove or disprove

14:00.625 --> 14:02.292
that this might be
a hidden location

14:02.417 --> 14:05.125
where Peter Easton might
have stashed a treasure.

14:05.250 --> 14:07.167
MATTY:
Another day in the muck.

14:07.250 --> 14:10.708
MARTY:
When diving in, basically, mud,

14:10.833 --> 14:13.708
it's the usual
challenge for Tony.

14:13.875 --> 14:15.375
You know, you've got
water on top of

14:15.500 --> 14:17.500
a lot of muddy, silty nastiness,

14:17.625 --> 14:20.375
so, you know, it's difficult.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.667
Tony's up for it, though, and
if anybody can figure it out,

14:22.792 --> 14:24.292
I think he can.

14:24.375 --> 14:26.375
Go get 'em, buddy.

14:39.042 --> 14:40.417
TONY:
Once entering the pond,

14:40.542 --> 14:44.292
I realized this is
going to be a braille dive.

14:44.375 --> 14:46.000
There's zero visibility,

14:46.083 --> 14:48.542
and I have my metal detector
going from side to side,

14:48.667 --> 14:51.375
and I'm slowly moving forward.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.375
MATTY:
Tony's probably
touching bottom right now.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.583
TONY:
What I'm feeling on the bottom

15:00.708 --> 15:01.708
is silt.

15:01.875 --> 15:03.500
I can penetrate through

15:03.625 --> 15:06.208
up to my shoulder in this silt,

15:06.375 --> 15:08.250
and I'm still not touching
a hard bottom.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.417
MATTY:
Is that a piece of wood?

15:20.625 --> 15:22.167
-That looks like
a piece of wood to me.
-BILL: Yeah.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.375
MATTY:
Another piece of wood.
That was definitely wood.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.708
TONY:
So, I'm feeling my way
through the silt.

15:31.833 --> 15:33.833
I can feel timber planks,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.667
almost like they've
been part of a box system.

15:36.833 --> 15:39.375
So maybe some
sort of drainage system.

15:39.542 --> 15:42.000
So, I don't know what
these artifacts are,

15:42.167 --> 15:45.000
so I can't wait to get
something up to the surface

15:45.083 --> 15:46.583
and let the guys
have a look at it.

15:47.792 --> 15:49.292
-He's found something.
-BILL: Yeah.

15:50.625 --> 15:51.917
-MATTY: Look at that.
-MARTY: Oh, look at that.

15:52.042 --> 15:53.167
-Yeah, he's got timber.
-Whoa.

15:54.458 --> 15:56.500
MATTY:
Whoa. Wow.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.000
MARTY:
What on earth is that?

15:58.125 --> 15:59.708
-I don't know.
-That's quite a collection.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.125
-Yeah, some...
-That's quite,
that's quite a bit, eh?

16:01.208 --> 16:02.375
Looks like planking to me.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.958
MATTY:
It stinks like the swamp, Marty,

16:04.083 --> 16:05.375
back on Oak Island.

16:05.542 --> 16:07.167
MARTY:
Oh, good.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.917
Huh, that is
definitely planking.

16:09.042 --> 16:11.917
-MATTY: Look at that.
-BILL: Look at that.

16:14.167 --> 16:16.333
MATTY:
Good job, mate.
I'm shutting off the air.

16:18.875 --> 16:20.833
There was timber on the bottom.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.500
-Wow.
-So, I don't know if it's oak,

16:23.583 --> 16:26.125
but, um, and then this,
you can see, has been worked.

16:26.250 --> 16:28.333
Look at that.
Yeah, that definitely has.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.083
You see, she's cut on
the end there, as well.

16:30.208 --> 16:32.083
-MARTY: Both ends, yeah.
-MATTY: It's beautiful.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.417
Notice, they're notched out.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.167
They almost fit
together like a puzzle.

16:36.292 --> 16:38.042
TONY:
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, whether...

16:38.167 --> 16:39.208
MATTY:
Piece of crate.
Looks like a crate box.

16:39.333 --> 16:40.667
That could be
an old crate. Yeah.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.250
TONY:
Or it felt like it was

16:42.375 --> 16:45.500
in the mud, so maybe
it was boxing something in.

16:45.625 --> 16:48.833
MATTY:
Ah. The question is, do those
grooves there on the end

16:49.000 --> 16:50.167
look fabricated or hand-done?

16:50.292 --> 16:52.375
TONY:
I mean, what they used to do

16:52.500 --> 16:54.375
with the old fret
and coping saws, eh?

16:54.500 --> 16:55.542
Look at the beautiful
French furniture

16:55.708 --> 16:57.500
that was done by hand.

16:57.625 --> 17:00.083
-Who knows, buddy?
-Yeah.

17:01.708 --> 17:04.500
NARRATOR:
Although varying
styles of joinery

17:04.625 --> 17:07.125
have existed in woodworking
for thousands of years,

17:07.250 --> 17:08.958
the dovetail style,

17:09.042 --> 17:11.167
which Tony has just
found an example of,

17:11.250 --> 17:13.333
was widely commonplace
in Western Europe

17:13.458 --> 17:16.542
during the 16th
and 17th centuries.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.000
Is it possible

17:18.083 --> 17:20.333
that the team has
just recovered evidence

17:20.458 --> 17:23.167
of a legendary treasure
that many believe

17:23.250 --> 17:25.000
Peter Easton buried in this area

17:25.125 --> 17:27.417
sometime around 1612?

17:28.583 --> 17:30.625
TONY:
I mean, you wanted
an oak-lined pond.

17:30.708 --> 17:33.167
I don't know if it's oak, but
it's definitely lined in that.

17:33.250 --> 17:34.875
How much of it is down there?

17:35.042 --> 17:36.708
TONY:
Uh, there's still heaps.

17:36.833 --> 17:38.750
-BILL: It's a start.
-MATTY: Yeah.

17:38.875 --> 17:40.167
BILL:
So, I'm not an expert in wood,

17:40.333 --> 17:41.958
but when we look at the wood,

17:42.042 --> 17:43.708
there's patterns of cutting,
there's dovetailing.

17:43.833 --> 17:46.833
There's so many questions
that need to be answered.

17:46.958 --> 17:49.042
Plan B is, we'll do some more

17:49.208 --> 17:50.917
magnetometer work
with the drone,

17:51.042 --> 17:52.875
so we're still optimistic.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.792
-Good job, mate.
-BILL: Good job, Tony.

17:54.917 --> 17:57.292
Matty to lidar team,

17:57.375 --> 17:59.583
we've called the dive
in the pond for now,

17:59.708 --> 18:02.500
so if you want to run
a full scan on the pond,

18:02.625 --> 18:05.167
that would be a great
time right now. Over.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.250
NARRATOR:
Due to the lack
of visibility

18:07.375 --> 18:10.542
and thick muck on
the bottom of the pond,

18:10.708 --> 18:13.125
drone expert Jordan Bannister
will now scan it

18:13.208 --> 18:16.667
with a magnetometer in order
to look for signs of metal

18:16.792 --> 18:18.833
beneath the wood planking.

18:18.958 --> 18:20.333
Once the scan is completed,

18:20.417 --> 18:21.958
it will then take several days

18:22.083 --> 18:24.083
to process the collected data.

18:24.208 --> 18:25.333
MATTY:
If Peter Easton

18:25.500 --> 18:27.375
left any significant part
of his treasure

18:27.542 --> 18:29.292
under that pond,
under those planks,

18:29.375 --> 18:31.167
they could find it
with this technology,

18:31.250 --> 18:34.458
give us a clear picture
and a real GPS-located

18:34.542 --> 18:37.458
spot to dive on,
which would be really cool.

18:38.458 --> 18:39.583
<i>MATTY:
Great job, guys.</i>

18:39.708 --> 18:41.458
Talk soon.

18:45.042 --> 18:47.042
-Ah!
-MARTY: Oh, baby.

18:47.208 --> 18:49.208
BILL:
Perfect.

18:53.167 --> 18:54.542
TONY: Looks like
we've got a perfect day

18:54.708 --> 18:56.000
-for this again, mate.
-Everything seems perfect.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.875
The air seems perfect.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.042
NARRATOR:
In Placentia Bay, Newfoundland,

19:00.208 --> 19:01.458
Marty Lagina,

19:01.542 --> 19:04.333
Matty Blake,
and diver Tony Sampson

19:04.458 --> 19:06.333
prepare to journey once again

19:06.417 --> 19:08.000
to nearby Oderin Island

19:08.167 --> 19:09.542
with researcher Bill Smith...

19:09.708 --> 19:10.833
MARTY:
Look at the grin on this guy.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.458
...and continue searching

19:12.542 --> 19:14.417
for a legendary
treasure connected

19:14.542 --> 19:17.792
to the 17th century
pirate Peter Easton.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.375
BILL:
We have something
that has potential

19:20.500 --> 19:21.917
to be a little bit exciting.

19:22.042 --> 19:23.167
-MARTY: Okay.
-Um,

19:23.292 --> 19:25.292
I got a tip from,
uh, Captain John,

19:25.375 --> 19:27.875
and, uh, we might
have some information

19:28.042 --> 19:29.292
on an authentic
Peter Easton shipwreck

19:29.417 --> 19:32.500
just offshore from the pond.

19:32.583 --> 19:34.375
I think we should change gears
and go have a look for it.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.917
-Wow.
-That sounds fabulous.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.792
See, I love when we get

19:38.875 --> 19:40.500
local knowledge like this.

19:40.667 --> 19:42.500
-Let me go get him for you.
-Please do. Please do. Yeah.

19:42.583 --> 19:46.667
NARRATOR:
In 1612, while still
operating a stronghold

19:46.792 --> 19:49.625
for the looting
of ships in this area,

19:49.750 --> 19:52.458
Peter Easton is known
to have commandeered

19:52.583 --> 19:54.375
numerous treasure
galleons belonging to

19:54.500 --> 19:56.333
rival Spanish Basque pirates,

19:56.458 --> 19:59.333
only to have some of them
sunk during ensuing battles.

19:59.458 --> 20:01.708
This is, uh, Wayne Rogers.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.333
MARTY:
Hello, Wayne.

20:03.458 --> 20:05.167
I'm Marty Lagina.
How are you, Wayne? Pleasure.

20:05.250 --> 20:06.917
-Matty Blake.
-Hi, Matty.

20:07.042 --> 20:07.792
-Nice to meet you.
-Thank you.

20:07.875 --> 20:09.000
And Tony Sampson.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.208
-Tony.
-Nice to meet you, Wayne.

20:10.333 --> 20:12.667
What you got for us?

20:12.792 --> 20:15.167
It's a little rude, I know,
but we're dying to hear.

20:17.042 --> 20:18.333
Well, that's pretty good.

20:18.458 --> 20:20.458
I can put you
dead on it, really.

20:20.583 --> 20:22.083
-MARTY: Really?
-Yep.

20:22.208 --> 20:23.583
In terms of where we were
yesterday, are we close,

20:23.708 --> 20:25.417
-were we close to the site?
-WAYNE: Yeah.

20:25.542 --> 20:26.917
Right behind
the pond is a cliff.

20:27.042 --> 20:28.833
-Yeah.
-Right from the rock,

20:28.917 --> 20:30.208
as you go off,

20:30.375 --> 20:32.167
the ship's out farther
in deeper water,

20:32.333 --> 20:34.167
maybe 40, 50 feet.

20:34.292 --> 20:36.000
I've dove it... multiple times.

20:36.167 --> 20:37.500
Mm-hmm.

20:37.583 --> 20:39.375
Uh, took some stuff off it.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.042
And what, uh, vintage
of the ship, do they...

20:42.208 --> 20:43.375
do you think?

20:43.500 --> 20:46.458
(sighs) I took
what I brought over

20:46.583 --> 20:50.083
to the head archaeologist
for the island at that time.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.500
I took out

20:51.667 --> 20:53.667
what I knew was
an Iberian olive jar.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.500
And they're big.

20:55.667 --> 20:57.292
They originally came, I suppose,

20:57.375 --> 20:58.917
with olives in them,
or olive oil.

20:59.042 --> 21:01.375
-Uh-huh.
-First thing he told me,

21:01.500 --> 21:03.208
the interesting thing about

21:03.333 --> 21:05.208
the Iberian olive jar
that I have...

21:09.708 --> 21:12.750
This is fascinating news, mate.
Like, really.

21:12.875 --> 21:14.625
MATTY:
Would this have been a ship
that Easton would have taken,

21:14.708 --> 21:16.667
a Basque ship that he
would have taken, possibly?

21:16.792 --> 21:17.875
Yup, who says someone
didn't come

21:18.000 --> 21:19.333
-to surprise him?
-Yes.

21:19.458 --> 21:21.375
So, that's all
I can tell you right now.

21:21.500 --> 21:22.750
I want to get in the water.

21:22.875 --> 21:23.833
I was just about to say,

21:23.958 --> 21:25.000
let's... let's go have a look.

21:25.167 --> 21:26.792
What are we waiting for?
Let's go.

21:26.917 --> 21:28.250
Yeah, exactly.

21:29.292 --> 21:31.625
BILL:
This information
is a game-changer

21:31.708 --> 21:33.375
because now we can shift gears.

21:33.500 --> 21:37.333
Right now we have
a huge opportunity

21:37.417 --> 21:40.000
to verify that Peter Easton
was on this island

21:40.083 --> 21:43.250
if we can identify this ship.

21:45.083 --> 21:46.583
Right through here, this way.

21:46.708 --> 21:49.583
I feel a tremendous amount

21:49.708 --> 21:51.667
of confidence that we're
gonna find something here.

21:53.750 --> 21:56.333
It would be lovely to
put a name to this girl.

21:56.417 --> 21:57.583
That's what I was gonna say.
He could be the one to

21:57.708 --> 21:59.542
identify it with your help,

21:59.708 --> 22:02.250
identifying this
part of the Easton story.

22:02.375 --> 22:04.167
What are we waiting for?

22:04.333 --> 22:05.333
Okay, let's get this show
on the road.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.417
Okay. Eyes and fins.

22:11.250 --> 22:13.583
MARTY:
Look at the two components here:

22:13.708 --> 22:15.417
we're after a legend
and we're after a treasure.

22:16.292 --> 22:17.500
Sealed.

22:17.583 --> 22:19.083
MARTY:
Let's take the legend component.

22:19.208 --> 22:22.250
If we get this tip
and we find this ship,

22:22.375 --> 22:24.458
and the ship can be identified

22:24.542 --> 22:27.333
as Peter Easton's,
then we know for sure

22:27.458 --> 22:29.333
that one of Peter Easton's ships

22:29.458 --> 22:30.875
was at Oderin Island

22:31.000 --> 22:32.708
and was right next to that pond.

22:34.042 --> 22:37.083
So, if we can identify
that ship, it would be huge.

22:39.208 --> 22:42.375
NARRATOR:
While Marty and Tony prepare
for the underwater investigation

22:42.500 --> 22:43.917
from the dive boat,

22:44.042 --> 22:45.458
Matty, Bill and Wayne

22:45.542 --> 22:47.375
will monitor the dive

22:47.500 --> 22:49.417
from another vessel
50 yards away.

22:51.042 --> 22:54.042
All right, Bill, this is
our underwater comms system

22:54.208 --> 22:56.167
that, hopefully,

22:56.292 --> 22:58.875
will allow us to talk
to our good friend.

23:00.958 --> 23:03.333
TONY:
Wayne's put us on what
he thinks is the spot,

23:03.458 --> 23:04.958
and that's very hard to do.

23:05.083 --> 23:07.667
In the days that he dove this,
he didn't have GPS.

23:07.833 --> 23:11.417
So, it's a triangulation system,
and it can be off.

23:11.542 --> 23:14.917
So the first dive is
an exploratory dive.

23:15.042 --> 23:16.583
We're gonna head down

23:16.708 --> 23:18.833
and see what we find,
and being ever optimistic,

23:18.917 --> 23:21.042
I hope we land on it
first time out.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.125
BILL:
Tony's in.

23:26.333 --> 23:28.583
We're going into
this first dive,

23:28.708 --> 23:30.375
we've got
a wealth of experience,

23:30.500 --> 23:33.000
world class divers,
we've got a ton of technology,

23:33.125 --> 23:35.458
and we've got an expert now
who we've recruited

23:35.542 --> 23:37.417
who's been on the bottom there.

23:37.542 --> 23:39.042
We're gonna find something.

23:39.208 --> 23:40.500
Find us a ship, Tony.

23:46.667 --> 23:48.917
TONY:
Descending down,
I'm really excited

23:49.042 --> 23:52.333
because the water visibility
here is actually good.

23:52.458 --> 23:54.333
I've got to about ten, 15 feet,

23:54.458 --> 23:56.333
maybe even around
20 feet in places.

23:56.417 --> 23:59.458
So that's making me
extremely happy.

23:59.583 --> 24:01.250
Water temperature
is not too bad at all.

24:01.375 --> 24:02.792
But I'm quite excited

24:02.875 --> 24:04.583
that this is going to
be a productive dive.

24:04.708 --> 24:07.542
Tony, Tony.
Matty, surface. Do you copy?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.667
-Ah!
-All right.

24:11.792 --> 24:14.500
<i>Tony, I hear
you loud and clear, mate.</i>

24:19.042 --> 24:20.167
Happy hunting, buddy.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.958
Here if you need me. Over.

24:23.375 --> 24:26.500
TONY:
I get to the bottom,
and what interests me here

24:26.625 --> 24:29.000
is, it's a gravelly,
shingly bottom,

24:29.083 --> 24:31.708
so that means any artifacts
are not gonna be buried

24:31.833 --> 24:33.583
under feet and feet of silt.

24:33.708 --> 24:36.417
They're gonna be sitting
on top of the gravel there.

24:36.542 --> 24:40.042
And it's just going to be
a systematic search

24:40.167 --> 24:43.167
across the bottom here
to try and find an old artifact

24:43.250 --> 24:45.708
that would give
credibility to these stories.

24:45.833 --> 24:47.458
How's the visibility? Over.

24:51.042 --> 24:52.000
Nice.

24:52.125 --> 24:53.333
Whew.

24:53.458 --> 24:55.167
Great, let's go find a ship.

24:55.333 --> 24:56.417
I'm going to let you work

24:56.542 --> 24:58.000
<i>for a little bit, okay, buddy?</i>

24:58.125 --> 24:59.542
<i>You let me know if
you need me. Over and out.</i>

25:02.958 --> 25:05.042
Does he realize how hard
this is on us right now?

25:05.167 --> 25:06.792
-Yes, he does, he does.
-Yeah? He does?

25:06.917 --> 25:08.500
That's the only reason
he's answering me.

25:08.625 --> 25:10.292
(both laugh)

25:10.417 --> 25:12.167
It's not about comforting him,
it's about comforting me.

25:12.292 --> 25:13.625
-Yeah.
-He just wants to get to work,
and I know that

25:13.708 --> 25:15.208
so I'm gonna let him work.

25:15.333 --> 25:16.750
This is the hard part.

25:22.292 --> 25:23.625
Ooh. Oh, Oh.

25:28.375 --> 25:31.667
Copy. 24 feet.
No viz on the wreck.

25:31.792 --> 25:33.750
<i>Confirmed. Roger that. Over.</i>

25:38.083 --> 25:40.333
Wayne, how, uh,
based on your eye,

25:40.458 --> 25:42.333
-do you think he's
in the right spot?
-Right there? No, no.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.833
-Okay.
-They're not in the right spot.

25:44.958 --> 25:46.375
MATTY:
So, which direction
would you like him to head?

25:46.500 --> 25:48.083
-Towards us.
-Towards us.

25:48.208 --> 25:49.708
Tony, it's Matty topside.

25:49.875 --> 25:52.458
<i>If you could orientate
yourself westbound,</i>

25:52.542 --> 25:54.750
<i>towards us, topside of the boat.</i>

25:54.875 --> 25:56.500
<i>Wayne says
that's the way to head.</i>

26:00.750 --> 26:04.167
Hey, Matty, it's a little quiet.
What's going on there?

26:04.292 --> 26:05.333
Wayne thinks he might be

26:05.458 --> 26:06.458
a little outside
the target zone,

26:06.583 --> 26:07.667
so we're having him head back

26:07.833 --> 26:09.417
towards our boat again.

26:09.542 --> 26:11.625
Roger that. Over.

26:22.625 --> 26:25.542
Go for Matty, topside. Over.

26:28.208 --> 26:29.375
-Ooh.
-Oh!

26:29.500 --> 26:30.750
BILL:
I can feel it, Matty.

26:30.875 --> 26:32.958
There's something
big right here.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.125
NARRATOR:
In Placentia Bay, Newfoundland,

26:39.250 --> 26:40.750
diver Tony Sampson

26:40.875 --> 26:43.333
has just made a potentially
important discovery

26:43.417 --> 26:46.000
while searching for evidence

26:46.125 --> 26:48.000
of a 17th century
shipwreck connected

26:48.167 --> 26:49.958
to the legendary
English pirate Peter Easton.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.958
-Pottery?
-Confirmed. Pottery. Great find.

26:56.042 --> 26:58.583
Does it look
period to you? Over.

27:01.875 --> 27:03.458
MATTY:
He's searching around,

27:03.583 --> 27:05.167
and boom. I hear "pottery."

27:05.292 --> 27:07.667
And Bill and I just
immediately high-five

27:07.833 --> 27:09.500
'cause we're like, okay,

27:09.583 --> 27:11.917
that could be evidence
of a wreck. No doubt.

27:13.333 --> 27:16.167
NARRATOR:
Due to the maritime
laws of Newfoundland,

27:16.292 --> 27:17.833
Tony is able to touch objects

27:17.958 --> 27:21.042
and artifacts that he finds
on the ocean bottom,

27:21.167 --> 27:23.792
but unfortunately
he is not permitted

27:23.917 --> 27:25.917
to bring them to the surface.

27:26.833 --> 27:28.542
Hey, I heard you guys kind of

27:28.708 --> 27:30.333
<i>cheer over there
a little bit. Fill me in.</i>

27:30.500 --> 27:31.833
I'm dying out here.
What's going on?

27:31.958 --> 27:35.208
He's found a piece
of pottery. Over.

27:35.375 --> 27:36.292
Piece of pottery.

27:36.375 --> 27:37.875
That's a good start. Over.

27:39.875 --> 27:41.750
That's great. Good start.

27:43.792 --> 27:46.875
Even though this was a good
dive as far as visibility,

27:47.000 --> 27:48.292
I'm getting low on air.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.000
He's covering a lot of ground.

27:50.125 --> 27:51.625
TONY:
So it's time to go
back to the surface

27:51.750 --> 27:53.625
and plan for the second dive.

27:56.042 --> 27:57.292
MATTY:
Oh.

27:57.417 --> 27:59.958
Copy that.
Diver leaving bottom.

28:00.083 --> 28:01.167
We're looking
for you to come up.

28:01.292 --> 28:03.292
Over. Out.

28:04.958 --> 28:06.542
NARRATOR:
Having found what
he believes to be

28:06.708 --> 28:08.000
evidence of
a possible shipwreck...

28:08.125 --> 28:09.667
MARTY:
I'll take the metal detector.

28:09.750 --> 28:12.167
...Tony returns to the surface

28:12.250 --> 28:14.458
to debrief the team
on what he observed

28:14.583 --> 28:16.292
on the ocean floor.

28:16.417 --> 28:18.042
-MARTY: Back to the mothership?
-TONY: To the mothership.

28:18.167 --> 28:20.667
NARRATOR:
After a brief rest,

28:20.750 --> 28:22.708
he will then conduct
another dive to search

28:22.875 --> 28:24.917
for more clues that could
validate the legend

28:25.042 --> 28:27.000
that Peter Easton hid treasure

28:27.083 --> 28:29.375
in a mysterious
oak-bottomed pond

28:29.500 --> 28:33.750
located just yards away
on the shore of Oderin Island.

28:36.333 --> 28:37.292
MATTY:
Gentlemen.

28:37.417 --> 28:38.667
How you doing, bud?

28:38.792 --> 28:40.542
MATTY:
That was quite a dive, Tony.

28:40.667 --> 28:42.875
I mean, since
we've been doing this,

28:43.042 --> 28:45.917
that's one of the largest areas
you've ever covered

28:46.042 --> 28:47.417
on a dive.

28:47.542 --> 28:48.667
I mean, you covered
a football field,

28:48.833 --> 28:50.000
-it looked like.
-BILL: Yeah.

28:50.125 --> 28:52.250
TONY:
Yup. No, we were
trying to find it

28:52.375 --> 28:53.958
somewhere in here.

28:54.083 --> 28:55.792
Um, the only interesting piece

28:55.917 --> 28:58.167
was that piece
of pottery over here.

28:58.292 --> 29:00.167
I still think
what we're looking for,

29:00.333 --> 29:04.542
as far as wreckage, was...
is pretty much

29:04.667 --> 29:07.167
-over the side, here.
-MATTY: So, if you

29:07.292 --> 29:09.000
stretch out a little further
that could be the breadcrumb

29:09.125 --> 29:10.500
-that you follow.
-Exactly.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.000
BILL:
Right now we're really excited

29:12.125 --> 29:15.833
because Tony has
found some pottery,

29:15.958 --> 29:18.542
and now we've got a huge
opportunity for a shipwreck.

29:18.667 --> 29:20.375
This shipwreck could
lead us to something

29:20.542 --> 29:21.875
that's even more substantial.

29:22.042 --> 29:24.167
There may be a link here
with Peter Easton.

29:24.292 --> 29:26.833
Okay, so we got
a drop line here now,

29:27.000 --> 29:28.667
we'll cut a pattern this way...

29:28.750 --> 29:31.708
-Great.
-...and let's see what we find.

29:31.875 --> 29:33.875
-Great diving. All right.
-Thanks, mate.

29:34.042 --> 29:35.292
-Nice going, Tony.
-See you soon, guys.

29:35.417 --> 29:36.833
Good luck, buddy.

29:36.958 --> 29:39.000
-Buddy, good luck.
-No pressure, buddy, but...

29:39.167 --> 29:41.625
-Last one.
-...find it. (chuckles)

29:41.750 --> 29:42.667
TONY:
Heading down to the bottom

29:42.750 --> 29:44.125
this time, optimism is high.

29:44.208 --> 29:46.958
Enthusiasm in my heart
is hopeful

29:47.042 --> 29:49.833
of finding a shipwreck
or parts of.

29:56.500 --> 29:59.167
BILL:
We're just hoping
that he's gonna find something.

29:59.292 --> 30:01.042
Down about ten feet.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.875
Any treasure hunter's hoping

30:03.042 --> 30:04.625
to find gold doubloons,

30:04.750 --> 30:06.833
pieces of eight, silver bars.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.167
I would be happy with

30:09.333 --> 30:11.500
completing another piece

30:11.625 --> 30:13.083
of the Easton picture.

30:16.417 --> 30:18.292
Diver on the bottom. Copy.

30:18.375 --> 30:20.542
Happy hunting, my friend.

30:20.708 --> 30:23.667
I reach the bottom and, again,
I've got the same structure.

30:23.792 --> 30:25.833
I've got a gravelly,
shingly bottom,

30:26.000 --> 30:28.792
and I'm really excited
about the visibility.

30:30.458 --> 30:32.792
-BILL: They're going
the right direction.
-MATTY: Yup. All right.

30:37.167 --> 30:38.500
MATTY:
Your bubbles look great,
keep heading

30:38.625 --> 30:41.042
in that setting. Over.

31:02.375 --> 31:03.250
Confirmed. Roger that.

31:03.375 --> 31:04.833
Thank you, Tony. Over.

31:11.833 --> 31:12.750
Come on, Tony.

31:12.875 --> 31:14.083
Be good to us.

31:21.792 --> 31:24.458
BILL:
Come on, Easton, it's time
to give us a little sign.

31:28.333 --> 31:30.417
Tony, Tony, it looks
like you're on a target.

31:30.542 --> 31:32.000
What do you see? Over.

31:36.875 --> 31:39.375
MATTY:
Come on, baby.

31:45.042 --> 31:47.083
<i>Topside, this is Tony.</i>

31:49.375 --> 31:52.250
(cheering)

31:55.625 --> 31:58.125
NARRATOR:
While searching for
a 17th century shipwreck

31:58.208 --> 32:00.500
connected to the English
pirate Peter Easton,

32:00.625 --> 32:04.542
diver Tony Sampson has just
made an exciting discovery.

32:05.750 --> 32:07.708
TONY:
Coming over a group of rocks,

32:07.833 --> 32:10.042
I now look down to
the bottom in the gravel,

32:10.167 --> 32:13.708
and there on the bottom,
covered in weed,

32:13.875 --> 32:15.750
is part of an olive jar.

32:15.875 --> 32:18.333
My heart just almost
jumps out of my chest.

32:18.458 --> 32:20.417
It's just like
what Wayne told us.

32:23.417 --> 32:25.667
Matty, go get your
wet suit on, will you?

32:25.792 --> 32:27.167
I'm so... I'm so about to.

32:28.375 --> 32:29.750
TONY:
It's the nicest one
I've ever found.

32:29.875 --> 32:31.667
Both of the handles are intact,

32:31.792 --> 32:34.500
and the lip is perfectly
intact as well.

32:34.583 --> 32:37.000
Without archaeological input,
it looks to me

32:37.167 --> 32:40.667
something from the mid-1500s
through to the end of the 1600s.

32:43.250 --> 32:44.875
NARRATOR:
Typically made of quartz,

32:45.042 --> 32:47.542
and originally used
for storing olive oil,

32:47.708 --> 32:49.708
olive jars were widely present

32:49.833 --> 32:52.833
on 16th and 17th century
treasure galleons,

32:52.917 --> 32:54.875
used for the transport
of different types

32:55.042 --> 32:57.083
of wet and dry goods.

32:58.250 --> 33:00.417
Although Tony may not have
found a piece of treasure,

33:00.542 --> 33:02.667
he has likely found
more evidence

33:02.833 --> 33:04.292
of a possible shipwreck.

33:04.417 --> 33:07.167
But unfortunately,
until the team

33:07.292 --> 33:09.500
can obtain permission
from the authorities,

33:09.625 --> 33:11.000
Tony must leave the artifact

33:11.083 --> 33:13.250
where he discovered it
on the ocean floor.

33:31.042 --> 33:33.208
-I'm feeling
really good about this.
-Mm-hmm.

33:35.583 --> 33:37.833
TONY:
With excitement
in my heart, I move.

33:37.917 --> 33:41.292
I'm now looking at
clay sailors' pipe stems.

33:42.208 --> 33:44.792
And there, just out of view,

33:44.917 --> 33:46.583
and it's coming into my view,

33:46.708 --> 33:48.292
is this weed.

33:50.500 --> 33:53.167
And I find another
couple of bits of pottery.

33:55.625 --> 33:58.333
I'm excited to see
this stuff on the bottom

33:58.458 --> 34:01.292
because that would give
credibility to these stories.

34:02.542 --> 34:03.833
-He's been there a while.
-WAYNE: He's found
something there.

34:03.958 --> 34:05.583
MATTY:
Yeah, he's been there a while.

34:07.375 --> 34:09.000
TONY:
I'm running low on bottom time,

34:09.125 --> 34:10.958
so it's time to
go back to the surface

34:11.042 --> 34:12.542
and give my report to the team.

34:15.125 --> 34:16.542
He's coming back towards
the boat now again, huh?

34:18.417 --> 34:19.167
Oh.

34:19.292 --> 34:21.333
-Oh.
-Diver's up.

34:23.042 --> 34:25.500
MARTY:
All right.

34:25.667 --> 34:27.167
All will be revealed
in a few moments.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.333
All will be revealed.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.958
BILL:
Come on, Tony Sampson,

34:30.083 --> 34:31.583
what do you have to tell us?

34:31.708 --> 34:33.833
So, right now we're
really excited because

34:34.000 --> 34:37.167
Tony has found something
off Oderin Island,

34:37.333 --> 34:39.208
but we don't know what it is.

34:40.208 --> 34:41.333
-MARTY: Tony.
-Yup.

34:41.500 --> 34:42.792
MARTY:
I don't want to rush you,

34:42.917 --> 34:44.208
but give it to me
in two sentences.

34:44.375 --> 34:46.708
-What did you...
-Okay. Possible shipwreck.

34:46.875 --> 34:49.000
-Possible? Pretty likely?
-Yup.

34:49.125 --> 34:50.042
-MATTY: Old?
-MARTY: Old?

34:50.167 --> 34:51.708
I think she's old.

34:51.833 --> 34:53.667
MARTY:
Eh, that's not bad.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.667
Nice.

34:55.792 --> 34:58.125
-MARTY: Let's find out why.
-MATTY: Hot dog.

34:58.208 --> 35:00.917
TONY:
So, coming back to the surface,

35:01.042 --> 35:02.875
the excitement on deck
is-is large.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.542
And the reason being is, now

35:05.667 --> 35:08.542
we're on the trail of
what I believe to be a ship.

35:10.708 --> 35:13.625
-Well, what do you think, mate?
-(laughter)

35:17.125 --> 35:18.500
TONY:
Well...

35:18.625 --> 35:21.750
we go down to
about 50 feet there,

35:21.875 --> 35:23.958
and we're going back
and forth in and out of there.

35:24.042 --> 35:28.125
-A lot of modern debris.
-MARTY: Yeah.

35:28.208 --> 35:29.542
Um, but then
the interesting thing is

35:29.667 --> 35:33.250
that I started to find
a lot of clay pipe stems.

35:33.375 --> 35:34.833
Okay. That's not modern.

35:34.917 --> 35:36.542
-No.
-No, so that's not modern.

35:36.708 --> 35:40.042
It was all in this sort of area
exactly like Wayne said.

35:40.208 --> 35:42.875
From here towards
the rock over there.

35:43.042 --> 35:45.167
BILL:
Tony has found old clay pipes,

35:45.333 --> 35:48.792
and you don't see
a lot of clay pipes

35:48.875 --> 35:50.208
right out in the ocean.

35:50.333 --> 35:51.500
You usually see them
near the shoreline,

35:51.625 --> 35:53.333
so it tells me that
there might be

35:53.458 --> 35:55.250
a ship there, and these clay
pipes were thrown overboard.

35:55.375 --> 35:57.875
I'm thinking, "We're on it.
We've got it."

35:58.000 --> 36:00.292
I didn't find any cannon
on that dive,

36:00.417 --> 36:02.667
but the interesting thing

36:02.750 --> 36:04.250
-was old pottery.
-Hmm.

36:04.375 --> 36:06.958
So, like the tops
of old olive jars

36:07.083 --> 36:10.667
and there was actually,
uh, almost like a beautiful

36:10.792 --> 36:12.167
pottery bowl down there.

36:12.333 --> 36:13.500
-MARTY: Mmm.
-BILL: Oh, wow.

36:13.625 --> 36:15.292
So, you saw
the bottom stem of it,

36:15.417 --> 36:17.000
and then she came up
into a beautiful bowl as well.

36:17.125 --> 36:19.292
-MARTY: No kidding.
-TONY: Yeah.

36:19.417 --> 36:21.792
I definitely think this
is the site of an old wreck.

36:23.458 --> 36:25.292
MARTY:
I agree with Tony.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.667
We observed period pieces
that are consistent

36:27.792 --> 36:31.375
with a ship, uh,
from Peter Easton's time,

36:31.500 --> 36:32.917
right on the island
where-where we think

36:33.042 --> 36:34.333
he may have left some treasure.

36:34.458 --> 36:37.667
This-this could be one
of Peter Easton's ships.

36:37.792 --> 36:40.250
I mean, we're quite sure

36:40.375 --> 36:42.375
-he had a hideout here.
-BILL: Yeah.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.042
MARTY:
We're quite sure
he controlled this area,

36:44.167 --> 36:45.208
and we're quite sure we have

36:45.333 --> 36:47.000
a very old wreck here.

36:47.125 --> 36:49.417
-Well, come on.
-I'm pretty...
I'm pretty excited.

36:49.542 --> 36:50.958
Those are really nice pieces.
Those are nice pieces.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.667
-I'm pretty excited.
-All right, that's good stuff.

36:52.792 --> 36:54.958
TONY:
Everything we've
come across so far--

36:55.042 --> 36:57.250
the artifacts on the bottom
of the ocean, the pond--

36:57.375 --> 36:59.000
all leads me to believe

36:59.167 --> 37:00.458
that this needs
further investigation

37:00.542 --> 37:02.333
in the Peter Easton story.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.000
And let's not forget,

37:04.167 --> 37:06.375
we have some imagery
to look at...

37:06.500 --> 37:07.833
-Yeah.
-...also...

37:07.917 --> 37:09.625
-MARTY: Yes.
-...that is being processed

37:09.708 --> 37:11.375
that could really, really
drive this point home

37:11.500 --> 37:12.708
that there is something here.

37:12.875 --> 37:14.167
Yeah, for sure.

37:14.292 --> 37:16.542
BILL:
You know, for me,
like, history...

37:16.708 --> 37:18.708
You always want to
see a gold doubloon

37:18.833 --> 37:21.167
or a gold bar
or a piece of eight,

37:21.292 --> 37:23.375
but, you know,
history is olive jars.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.333
-History is...
-Of course.

37:25.500 --> 37:26.542
...finding something in
a different part of the world

37:26.708 --> 37:28.875
that it's not supposed
to be in, right?

37:29.042 --> 37:30.667
Uh, you know, clay pipes.

37:30.792 --> 37:33.000
I mean, clay pipes
out in the middle of a bay,

37:33.083 --> 37:34.542
not near a wharf.
There's a reason.

37:34.708 --> 37:36.542
There's a ship out there, so...

37:36.708 --> 37:38.708
Uh, it's just another
piece, you know,

37:38.875 --> 37:41.792
and it's, uh... Thanks for
making me a part of it, guys.

37:41.917 --> 37:44.125
-Yeah.
-Well, I'm-I'm pretty
happy, buddy.

37:44.208 --> 37:46.167
I mean, I would love
to come back here again.

37:46.292 --> 37:47.333
There's probably a cold beer

37:47.500 --> 37:49.083
sitting on a bar
for us somewhere.

37:49.208 --> 37:50.750
-MARTY: To our next adventure.
-TONY: Well done, team.

37:59.625 --> 38:01.792
MATTY: Well, Rick,
your brother and I,

38:01.875 --> 38:03.625
along with Tony,
had quite an adventure.

38:03.708 --> 38:05.917
as you... as you know,
with Bill here.

38:06.042 --> 38:07.208
And, man, what a time.

38:07.375 --> 38:08.958
-What a time we had.
-MARTY: For sure.

38:09.083 --> 38:11.042
MATTY:
There's also evidence
that we found

38:11.167 --> 38:13.542
as to your trail

38:13.667 --> 38:16.208
on Peter Easton,
and it started in that pond.

38:16.375 --> 38:19.333
And that pond
was really cool to see.

38:19.500 --> 38:20.917
It vaguely reminded me, Rick,

38:21.042 --> 38:23.208
of a smaller version
of the swamp, in a way.

38:23.333 --> 38:24.875
You know, 'cause
you have the beach,

38:25.042 --> 38:27.583
you have a small land divide,
and then you have this

38:27.708 --> 38:30.500
little bit of
an anomalous water feature

38:30.625 --> 38:33.167
that does seem odd in some ways.

38:33.292 --> 38:35.417
The guys who did
the drone lidar with us,

38:35.542 --> 38:38.083
their magnetometer actually
has data that there is actually

38:38.208 --> 38:40.000
an anomaly in the pond.

38:40.083 --> 38:42.917
And since we've been there,

38:43.042 --> 38:44.667
there has been some new findings

38:44.792 --> 38:46.333
that I would...
I brought with me,

38:46.417 --> 38:48.083
I'd like to show
you guys today. Sound good?

38:48.208 --> 38:49.042
-Yeah.
-MARTY: Of course.

38:49.167 --> 38:51.333
Can't wait to hear.

38:56.667 --> 38:59.000
BILL: There has been
some new findings

38:59.083 --> 39:00.458
that I brought with me,

39:00.542 --> 39:02.000
I'd like to show
you guys today. Sound good?

39:02.083 --> 39:04.167
-Yeah.
-MARTY: Of course.

39:04.292 --> 39:05.958
The guys who did
the drone lidar with us,

39:06.083 --> 39:08.083
their magnetometer,
what they did extract,

39:08.208 --> 39:09.625
there is actually

39:09.708 --> 39:11.625
an anomaly in the pond.

39:12.708 --> 39:16.375
Okay, so we all know
that this is, uh, the pond.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.000
So, Tony spent

39:18.167 --> 39:19.750
a considerable amount of time

39:19.875 --> 39:21.667
over in the central portion
of the pond,

39:21.792 --> 39:25.292
and right where
we see the lines right here,

39:25.417 --> 39:26.833
where they come into the pond,

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
which could potentially
be drainage tunnels

39:29.125 --> 39:30.750
coming from the hill,

39:30.875 --> 39:33.167
there is a magnetic
anomaly found about

39:33.250 --> 39:36.250
three feet below
the sediment layer,

39:36.375 --> 39:38.833
and it's a significant
magnetic anomaly,

39:38.917 --> 39:40.542
we've been told
by the lidar guys.

39:40.708 --> 39:42.500
-I'm sorry. Metallic?
-Metallic, yeah.

39:42.667 --> 39:44.708
MARTY:
This has been a legend
that his treasure

39:44.833 --> 39:46.792
is in this pond for
a long time, right?

39:46.875 --> 39:48.083
BILL:
Yeah.

39:48.208 --> 39:49.000
MARTY:
Which means I'd like to

39:49.125 --> 39:50.667
get that magnetometer data

39:50.792 --> 39:53.667
fully processed and have
them do us a written report.

39:53.833 --> 39:55.500
I mean, I'm just suggesting

39:55.625 --> 39:57.542
-'cause it's worth
following up on.
-Yeah.

39:58.833 --> 40:01.125
Here, we don't really know
for sure there's a treasure.

40:01.250 --> 40:03.417
It makes sense,

40:03.542 --> 40:05.542
and he and I go through
role reversal all the time,

40:05.667 --> 40:09.042
but for me this one
is more about the story,

40:09.167 --> 40:11.000
uh, which is not normal for me.

40:11.125 --> 40:13.000
-What?
-Yeah, you heard me.

40:13.125 --> 40:14.167
(laughter)

40:14.292 --> 40:15.417
It is. I just find this guy

40:15.542 --> 40:16.958
incredibly interesting.

40:17.042 --> 40:19.625
These stories are
being lost by the day.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.542
That's the other thing
we've learned about

40:21.667 --> 40:23.333
all these treasure hunts
we've been on.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.500
These stories are being lost,

40:25.625 --> 40:27.292
to the detriment of humanity.

40:27.375 --> 40:28.917
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Right?

40:29.042 --> 40:30.375
Stories that are unique.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.917
So, I-I'd like us
to somehow get together...

40:33.042 --> 40:35.667
MARTY:
Well, I think... I think
the province of Newfoundland

40:35.750 --> 40:38.458
would be quite excited
if you were successful,

40:38.583 --> 40:39.583
one way or another.

40:39.708 --> 40:41.792
I mean, it would be a big deal,

40:41.917 --> 40:43.500
and they're... you know,
'cause it's-it's-it's...

40:43.625 --> 40:45.083
it's their history.

40:45.208 --> 40:47.333
BILL:
On many levels,

40:47.458 --> 40:49.000
this treasure hunt was a success

40:49.125 --> 40:52.333
because we have new data
that we didn't have before.

40:52.458 --> 40:54.042
We now have another link

40:54.208 --> 40:57.458
that says traditional,
oral traditions, folklore,

40:57.583 --> 40:59.333
that these are based in reality.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.000
So that means some
of the other traditions

41:01.167 --> 41:03.750
that we have in this area
will also be based in reality,

41:03.875 --> 41:05.500
and we're gonna find more.

41:05.667 --> 41:07.083
MATTY:
I think this is
one of those cases

41:07.208 --> 41:10.083
where the sum of the parts,
the disparate parts,

41:10.208 --> 41:13.417
start to add up to,
"We've got something here."

41:13.542 --> 41:15.625
When you look at
the anomaly of those tunnels

41:15.708 --> 41:18.792
and now this
new anomaly in the pond,

41:18.917 --> 41:20.292
potentially,
looks like one to me.

41:20.375 --> 41:22.000
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

41:22.167 --> 41:26.083
And then you have what he saw
on the bottom of the ocean.

41:26.208 --> 41:28.542
I think we have something here,

41:28.667 --> 41:30.708
and I think you have
a lot to pursue,

41:30.833 --> 41:33.000
and you should. It's worthy.

41:33.125 --> 41:34.250
It's a great story.

41:34.375 --> 41:36.125
-Yeah.
-MARTY: I can't say it

41:36.208 --> 41:37.333
any better than that.

41:37.417 --> 41:38.458
That was a good
summation, Matty.

41:38.542 --> 41:39.500
-Thanks, buddy.
-You're welcome.

41:39.667 --> 41:40.875
I've learned from the best.

41:41.042 --> 41:42.375
Thanks for... thanks for
coming to Newfoundland.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.667
-It was quite an adventure.
-Yes.

41:43.750 --> 41:45.417
Thanks for helping my brother

41:45.542 --> 41:47.583
to advance his appreciation
of the story.

41:47.708 --> 41:49.167
-Yes.
-Yes.

41:49.292 --> 41:50.667
All right.

41:50.750 --> 41:51.875
We got our own treasure
here to go after.

41:52.000 --> 41:52.750
Yeah, you do.

41:52.875 --> 41:53.833
MATTY:
Let's go find

41:53.958 --> 41:55.375
that Oak Island treasure, boys.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.292
