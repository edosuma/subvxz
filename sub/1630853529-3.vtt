WEBVTT

01:18.120 --> 01:19.705
Ooh!

01:21.749 --> 01:23.083
Take it in, Dale.

01:23.167 --> 01:25.377
The Fairfax Flea Market.

01:25.461 --> 01:27.004
- I know I always say
nature sucks,

01:27.087 --> 01:29.590
but this is an ecosystem
I can get behind.

01:33.469 --> 01:35.513
- Wow.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.348
I-I always thought fleas were
where you got furniture made out

01:37.431 --> 01:40.351
of license plates, but this is
like a hypebeast Disneyland.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.437
Yeah.
Minus the racist log ride.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.272
Oh, and the racist
Jungle Cruise.

01:45.356 --> 01:46.732
Oh, and the racist
little people world.

01:46.816 --> 01:48.400
Wait. Uh-uh.

01:48.484 --> 01:50.069
This place is famous, Dale.

01:50.152 --> 01:52.863
All the legends found their look
at the Fairfax Flea.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.323
Yeah, it's where
Billie Eilish found

01:54.406 --> 01:55.741
her double-XL Gucci shorts.

01:55.825 --> 01:57.576
And where Tupac found
his bandana!

01:57.660 --> 01:59.954
And where Melody gets
her sense of entitlement!

02:00.037 --> 02:01.872
- Ooh. Savage.

02:01.956 --> 02:04.208
Super savage.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.377
- No.
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.421
Damn, D, Melody still got you
all up in your feelings?

02:09.505 --> 02:11.006
She's messing with my head,
bruh.

02:11.090 --> 02:13.926
That's why it's time
for a little retail therapy.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.554
I'm gonna find a jacket
that tells that two-faced biotch

02:16.637 --> 02:18.472
I'm not interested.

02:18.556 --> 02:20.683
Unless she changes her mind.
Wish me luck.

02:20.766 --> 02:22.768
A'ight, Dale, you ready to flea?

02:22.852 --> 02:24.144
Oh, yeah.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.813
And I got
a little something something

02:25.896 --> 02:28.107
I've been saving
for a special occasion.

02:29.608 --> 02:33.904
The 1969
GT California Radio Flyer.

02:33.988 --> 02:36.198
Less than a hundred were made.

02:36.282 --> 02:38.033
I spent three years
restoring this wagon.

02:38.117 --> 02:40.369
It is my life. It is my love...

02:40.452 --> 02:42.454
It is only gonna slow us down.

02:42.538 --> 02:43.664
This shit is lame as hell.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.332
What? No way.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.793
Think of all the Latrine gear
we can fill this puppy with.

02:47.877 --> 02:49.003
Touché, Dale.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.880
Now you're thinking
like a real dealer.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.047
Yo, Tru, you coming with?

02:52.131 --> 02:54.216
My boy Rico
just got in a hot new batch

02:54.300 --> 02:55.634
of vintage Latrine gear.

02:55.718 --> 02:57.887
Not today, boys.
I got a shopping list longer

02:57.970 --> 02:59.263
than a CVS receipt.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.932
Yah.
I got to up my production game.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.351
'Cause there are full-blown
seven-year-old auteurs

03:04.435 --> 03:07.855
making Chrissy Nolan movies
on TikTok right now, man.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.064
Suit yourself, Tru.

03:09.148 --> 03:10.566
Let's roll, Dale.

03:10.649 --> 03:11.984
Don't forget to hydrate, boys.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.153
It's a scorcher today.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.740
Ooh! Hey, Ms. Rubin,
what's with this boomer vape?

03:17.823 --> 03:19.825
Is this how y'all got lifted
during the Great Depression?

03:19.909 --> 03:23.454
No, baby,
that's my talk box.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.456
It's like, uh, Auto-Tune's dad.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.000
Go ahead. Say something into it.

03:31.295 --> 03:34.423
Whoa, this is sick.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.303
Hmm, where is it? Where is it?

03:41.847 --> 03:43.265
What the...?

03:43.349 --> 03:44.516
Ugh.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.518
Hey. Out of my way,
Sergeant Thick.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.228
Sherman.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.064
Hmm.

03:51.273 --> 03:54.360
Weird. We should have hit my boy
Rico three Gucci booths ago.

03:54.443 --> 03:56.779
All this Off-Brian shit's
messing with my head.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.280
Ooh, maybe he's this way.

04:00.950 --> 04:02.618
- Hmm.
- Dale, no!

04:02.701 --> 04:04.161
That's the Shady Side.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.704
We don't go that way.

04:05.788 --> 04:07.247
We stay in the sun,
where the good good is.

04:07.331 --> 04:10.292
But how can one side be good
and another be bad?

04:10.376 --> 04:12.962
I don't make the rules, cuh.
The culture does!

04:13.045 --> 04:15.339
And that's where the old brands
go to die.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.716
But it's so hot out.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.635
A little shade
sounds kind of nice.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.720
Okay, just this once.

04:21.804 --> 04:22.846
But stay close.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.807
It's mad shady
on the Shady Side.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.144
Hmm.

04:29.228 --> 04:31.105
Mmm!

04:32.815 --> 04:35.526
- Looking for something special?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.236
We got Daisy Dukes
that solve your BFF beef,

04:37.319 --> 04:39.363
band tees to deal
with your daddy issues

04:39.446 --> 04:40.698
or how 'bout
some vintage Nudie jeans

04:40.781 --> 04:42.449
that are guaranteed
to make your ex cry?

04:42.533 --> 04:44.702
Yeah, I'm actually thinking
more along the lines

04:44.785 --> 04:47.746
of a "reinvent myself
post-rejection jacket."

04:47.830 --> 04:49.081
The section
behind the stack of hangers

04:49.164 --> 04:51.500
should have
what you're looking for, girl.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.335
Uh...

04:53.419 --> 04:54.920
Yo!

04:55.004 --> 04:57.089
Holy shit.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.845
That one screams "new you."

05:02.928 --> 05:05.347
Ooh, yeah!

05:05.431 --> 05:08.392
Elle Fanning white,
fresh-ass fringe.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.436
- I'll take it.
- You sure you don't want a bag?

05:10.519 --> 05:12.146
- It's really hot.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.897
I know, right?
I'm never taking it off.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.983
It's who I am now.
Bury me in it.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.658
Oh, that was inspired, Tru.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.160
You sound like Peter Frampton.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.328
But sad, like Frank Ocean.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.164
Took me back
to my Percocet days.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.582
Just kidding!

05:31.665 --> 05:33.500
No, I'm not. Mmm.

05:33.584 --> 05:36.587
Truman, these are my girls,

05:36.670 --> 05:37.880
Jan, Barb

05:37.963 --> 05:39.381
- and Other Barb.
- Hold up, Trini.

05:39.465 --> 05:41.633
- Are you in a mom band?

05:41.717 --> 05:44.636
No, no, no. We just jam together
on weekends.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.055
You want to come jam with us?

05:46.138 --> 05:47.556
You're a pretty good improvisor.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.224
Uh, you know, that sounds fun,

05:49.308 --> 05:51.727
but I-I just got a lot
on my plate right now.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.063
- Jesus.
- What?

05:54.146 --> 05:55.814
Being a writer/director's
a full-time job.

05:55.898 --> 05:58.901
Truman, no one has more to do
than a freaking mom.

05:58.984 --> 06:01.195
- Am I right, ladies?
- That's right.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.322
Come on! Come play with us!

06:03.405 --> 06:05.240
Screw it.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.536
You guys,
I'm half-empty.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.378
Benny, look!

06:18.462 --> 06:20.005
Prehistoric porn!

06:20.089 --> 06:21.715
Don't touch that, Dale.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.717
- That's how you get HPV.
- Yo, yo,

06:23.801 --> 06:26.929
I got a pair of drop crotches
with your name on it.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.722
Shoo! Get away!

06:28.806 --> 06:30.599
- Hyah! Hyah-hyah!

06:30.682 --> 06:33.102
These are vile creatures. Don't
make eye contact with them.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.270
Scuse me. Hi there. Dale Rubin.

06:35.354 --> 06:37.064
Love your fanny collection.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.024
- Would you be so kind
as to point me

06:39.108 --> 06:41.151
in the direction
of the Latrine booth?

06:41.235 --> 06:42.653
Latrine, you say?

06:42.736 --> 06:44.154
Okay, let me ask someone.

06:44.238 --> 06:47.449
- Hey, Doris! Tandy! Jeremiah!
- What have you done?

06:47.533 --> 06:48.784
We got
a little somebody over here

06:48.867 --> 06:50.035
- looking for a La-Trine?
- Move, move, move!

06:50.119 --> 06:52.371
Go!

06:52.454 --> 06:53.413
Gah!

06:53.497 --> 06:54.915
My wagon!

06:54.998 --> 06:57.126
Damn you, shoddy terrain!

06:57.209 --> 06:59.753
Fuck, Dale. I told you
that shit would slow us down!

06:59.837 --> 07:01.755
Hey! Fuck off, flea people!

07:01.839 --> 07:04.925
I got an EpiPen
and I'm not afraid to use it!

07:06.176 --> 07:07.344
- Aah!
- Oh, yeah.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.974
Looks like you got
a busted wheel, my man.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.267
Name's Lorelai.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.394
I got a few hover spares
back at base camp

07:15.477 --> 07:16.603
that might do the trick.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.730
Whoa, what happened
to your legs, mister?

07:18.814 --> 07:21.191
Christmas, 2018. Faulty battery.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.777
Boom! Blew my legs clean off!

07:23.861 --> 07:25.112
And you're still riding them?

07:25.195 --> 07:26.446
Oh, hell yes.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.282
Boarding is my life, man.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.450
I'd sooner die
than stop hoverin'.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.537
Yep, I've repaired
over 300 boards in my day, man.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.205
And I can sure as hell

07:35.289 --> 07:37.541
help you out on that
Oregon Trail wagon of yours.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.835
Oh, that would be amazing.
Thank you so much.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.004
Hey, these people
are fucking shady, Dale.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.256
I'm just gonna say it...
they seem pretty cool to me.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.842
Ugh, fine.
But as soon as it's fixed,

07:46.925 --> 07:48.260
we hit the road back
to the Sunny Side

07:48.343 --> 07:49.928
before all that good shit
is gone.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.180
All right, gentlemen,

07:51.263 --> 07:53.015
right this way.

07:54.725 --> 07:57.019
Welcome to base camp.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.354
Whoa.

07:59.438 --> 08:00.522
Oh...

08:08.322 --> 08:09.281
Wow.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.782
This place rules.

08:10.866 --> 08:11.783
Yeah.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.202
Pretty sweet, right?

08:13.285 --> 08:14.786
Are you insane?

08:14.870 --> 08:16.371
Don't compliment
these street urchins.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.373
Benny, look!

08:23.712 --> 08:25.088
Latrine?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.798
On the Shady Side?

08:26.882 --> 08:28.926
- Hu...

08:29.009 --> 08:31.094
No, no, no, no...!

08:31.178 --> 08:33.513
- [

08:47.486 --> 08:49.905
- <i>Mwah!</i>

08:49.988 --> 08:51.448
<i>and justice...</i>

08:51.531 --> 08:53.575
That girl looks like
she's never been rejected.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.452
What if I haven't?

08:57.412 --> 08:59.456
I'm from <i>Tween Vogue Japan.</i>

08:59.539 --> 09:01.041
Can I snap this outfit?

09:01.124 --> 09:03.335
You'll make lots of girls jelly.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.262
Huh?

09:13.345 --> 09:14.304
Hmm.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.560
- Yeah.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.647
This doesn't make any sense.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.149
Yep. Sorry to say, my man,

09:26.233 --> 09:27.943
but the writing's on the wall.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.529
The circle of hype is running
its natural course.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.197
Off-Brian's taking over,

09:32.281 --> 09:35.075
and Latrine is all but cooked.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.493
But it ain't all bad.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.995
Take Tiff, for instance.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.329
She's waited patiently,

09:39.413 --> 09:41.832
and now she's finally moving on.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.084
Wh-What do you mean,
"moving on"?

09:44.167 --> 09:46.628
She's headed back
to the Sunny Side, baby.

09:46.712 --> 09:49.548
Off-Brian did a collab
with Abercrombie.

09:49.631 --> 09:52.384
Next thing you know,
Crombie's cool again.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.763
You see, Benny?

09:56.847 --> 09:58.307
Latrine might be cool again.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.601
In, like, 20 years.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.395
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.439
- Okay, okay,
you're gonna be all right.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.858
Here, sip on one
of these bad boys.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.444
- Help you take the edge off.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.487
This is bullshit.

10:12.571 --> 10:13.530
What can I say, man?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.490
Fashion's a fickle mistress.

10:15.574 --> 10:19.661
But now you got to do
as the circle of hype dictates.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.204
And...

10:21.288 --> 10:23.999
- die?
- Don't think of it
like death.

10:24.082 --> 10:26.501
Think of it as freedom, man.

10:26.585 --> 10:31.340
Now go! Bask in the shade
of your fellow ride-or-die'ers!

10:31.423 --> 10:32.466
Oh...

10:32.549 --> 10:34.051
Huh?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.887
- Oh, wow.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.514
Oh.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.309
Whoa.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.227
- Huh?
- Uh-uh-uh.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.855
You got to let him hover solo
on this one.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.608
Besides, we got a wagon to fix.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.579
Oh! How do you feel?

11:02.662 --> 11:05.123
I feel like Bruno Mars,
but taller, cooler...

11:08.627 --> 11:10.128
- All right!
- Boom!

11:10.212 --> 11:11.588
Yeah. Killed it!

11:11.671 --> 11:14.674
Hey, hey. Yes, Truman!

11:16.927 --> 11:18.595
Oh, shoot.
We're on in an hour!

11:18.678 --> 11:20.931
- Wait. When you say,
"On in an hour..."
- Yeah.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.433
We're performing behind
the food truck at 4:00 p.m.

11:23.517 --> 11:24.935
Pretty sweet, right?

11:25.977 --> 11:28.063
But I thought
we was just jamming!

11:28.146 --> 11:31.400
This is
the pre-jam before the jam.

11:31.483 --> 11:32.859
It's all good, Tru.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.444
Performing is
a different game, Trini.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.405
I got to be honest.
We're not ready.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.572
Not even close!

11:37.656 --> 11:38.990
Seriously, it's super chill.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.700
We're on
after a damn ventriloquist.

11:40.784 --> 11:43.495
Okay, okay, we need costumes,
makeup, lighting for sure. Wait.

11:43.578 --> 11:46.164
- We don't even have a name.
- Yeah, we do.

11:46.248 --> 11:47.874
Trini & the C-Sections.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.965
Hey, girls.

11:55.048 --> 11:59.636
Super hot, right?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.847
Whew. Yo.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.599
I need water.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.561
Yikes, Der Bear.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.563
You're scaring away
the customers.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.398
I'm just kidding. I-I don't
have any customers yet,

12:11.481 --> 12:13.817
but are you okay?

12:13.900 --> 12:16.778
Don't be jelly, Grant Bear.

12:16.862 --> 12:21.616
I just need
an ice-cold lemonade.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.953
Hey.

12:27.706 --> 12:30.709
"Big Love"]

13:05.994 --> 13:08.497
<i>'nother spin gone round...</i>

13:08.580 --> 13:10.415
- Ouch! Ouch!

13:10.499 --> 13:12.417
Barb, if we want to shine,
we're gonna have to do something

13:12.501 --> 13:14.002
to distract
from that frizzy-ass bob.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.462
Ladies, I don't
hear you playing.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.632
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.009
If this was a film set,
I'd shut us down

13:21.092 --> 13:22.928
because we are not ready!

13:23.011 --> 13:26.973
Other Barb, do you want
to take this seriously or not?

13:27.057 --> 13:30.101
How many times
do we have to tell you? Not!

13:32.354 --> 13:35.440
Listen, Tru,
I brought you into the mom band

13:35.524 --> 13:37.234
because I thought
it'd be fun for you,

13:37.317 --> 13:38.944
but you're harshing the vibes.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.947
Even Other Barb's bugging,
and she can't be shook.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.491
She was in labor for 46 hours.

13:44.574 --> 13:45.992
No epidural.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.410
Uh, I hear you, Trini,

13:47.494 --> 13:49.746
but performances
aren't supposed to be chill.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.790
They're choreographed, they're
focused, they're coordinated.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.291
That is how greatness
is achieved.

13:53.375 --> 13:56.586
No offense, but I'm not trying
to be a backup singer.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.505
- Go on.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.006
I mean, that might have
been fine for you,

14:00.090 --> 14:01.841
but I'm trying to be Prince.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.426
If we're not trying
to be God level,

14:03.510 --> 14:05.011
then why are we even here?

14:05.095 --> 14:07.681
I don't know why
I wasted my time with y'all.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.433
You know what? I quit.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.186
Ugh!

14:14.729 --> 14:17.148
Do the honors,
my mini boarder.

14:20.694 --> 14:23.655
Wow! It is bitchin', Lorelai.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.323
I can't wait to show Benny.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.617
Hey, speaking of which,
has anyone seen Benny?

14:27.701 --> 14:29.661
- Over here, brah.
- There you are.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.747
Look, uh, today was a great
cultural exchange,

14:32.831 --> 14:34.541
but my mom's performing soon,

14:34.624 --> 14:37.127
and if you want to cop some
good stuff, we got to go now.

14:37.210 --> 14:41.464
- Uh, I'm not going
anywhere, Dale.
- What?

14:41.548 --> 14:44.509
Don't you see?
This is the good stuff.

14:44.593 --> 14:48.305
I'm a man of the shade now.
These are my people.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.682
I no longer have my finger
on the cultural pulse,

14:50.765 --> 14:52.934
- and I've never
felt more alive.

14:53.018 --> 14:55.604
But you are Mr. Sunny Side.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.188
Can't fight nature, brah.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.691
I've taken a wife.
I've made a home.

14:59.774 --> 15:02.277
We already have a baby
that's actually a cake.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.990
Mmm. Mmm!
Fuck, that's delicious.

15:07.073 --> 15:10.410
- Just promise
you'll never forget me, Dale.
- But...

15:10.493 --> 15:11.995
- No buts. Go on.
- Ah.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.413
- Get! Get out of here!

15:13.496 --> 15:15.540
Just text me
when you guys are leaving.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.588
Where am I?

15:21.671 --> 15:26.051
You came to the flea market
for some retail therapy.

15:26.134 --> 15:29.804
Tell me, Derica,
what's going on?

15:29.888 --> 15:32.057
Oh, where do I begin,
Dr. Jacket?

15:32.140 --> 15:34.309
You do have a PhD, right?

15:34.392 --> 15:36.019
Girl, please.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.898
Well, things have been confusing

15:39.981 --> 15:41.816
with this girl
I'm crushing on.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.777
You mean Melody?

15:43.860 --> 15:45.278
How'd you know?

15:45.362 --> 15:48.031
I'm a figment
of your imagination.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.450
Oh, right.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.997
Well, she opened up to me,
then totally shut me out,

15:56.081 --> 15:57.290
and I don't know anymore.

15:57.374 --> 16:00.001
- Mm-hmm.
- I just feel like an idiot.

16:00.085 --> 16:03.380
You zipped up your emotions
for too long,

16:03.463 --> 16:05.715
turning your collar
to the world

16:05.799 --> 16:07.467
while you play it cool.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.553
I know. It feels good
to stay buttoned up,

16:10.637 --> 16:13.431
but if you don't open up
every once in a while,

16:13.515 --> 16:15.558
you'll never feel...

16:15.642 --> 16:18.269
the breeze.

16:18.353 --> 16:22.232
Damn.
That's a deep pocket, Dr. J.

16:22.315 --> 16:26.236
And look, if Melody isn't
the right fit, forget her.

16:26.319 --> 16:29.823
There are plenty
of other jackets on the rack.

16:34.452 --> 16:37.831
Gosh dang it, come on! Ugh!

16:44.129 --> 16:46.631
"Brake." "The."

16:46.715 --> 16:48.508
Yup, yup, I got it.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.135
Break the circle of hype.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.011
Okay, let's do it.

16:52.095 --> 16:55.014
So great doing business
with you, ma'am, and by the way,

16:55.098 --> 16:57.600
my flea colleague
Susan over there has some

16:57.684 --> 16:59.686
beautifully rhinestoned jeans
if you'd like to peruse further.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.938
- Okay. That's it.
- Oh.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.442
- Hey, Dale.
- It's time for some serious
fanny talk, mister.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.194
Just because you found some
Latrine shirts on the Shady Side

17:08.278 --> 17:10.613
doesn't mean there isn't a place
for it in the sun.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.866
Face it, Dale.
Latrine isn't the shit anymore,

17:12.949 --> 17:14.200
and neither am I.

17:14.284 --> 17:15.618
You're gonna have
to find a new sherpa.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.245
- Bullshit!

17:18.288 --> 17:20.790
That's right.
Dale Rubin said "Bullshit."

17:20.874 --> 17:23.084
It's hot,
and I haven't napped today.

17:23.168 --> 17:24.544
You want to cozy up
in one of Pierre's Snuggies?

17:24.627 --> 17:26.045
<i>- Oui? Oui?</i>
- No!

17:26.129 --> 17:28.590
They're just backward robes,
and everyone knows it!

17:28.673 --> 17:29.924
<i>Oui. Oui.</i>

17:30.008 --> 17:32.177
I'm sorry.
Again, have not napped.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.888
Okay, look,
the Benny I know would never

17:34.971 --> 17:37.557
just lay down and die like
my dad's vape coozy business

17:37.640 --> 17:39.142
probably eventually will.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.561
The Benny I know
would freaking fight!

17:41.644 --> 17:43.354
You're the tightest kid
I know, man,

17:43.438 --> 17:45.690
and Latrine can still
be tight, too.

17:45.774 --> 17:50.195
It's only trash
if you let it be trash.

17:50.278 --> 17:53.406
Dale, you're devaluing
some of my favorite words,

17:53.490 --> 17:56.034
but damn it, you're right.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.703
For once in your sweet,
sheltered, Boy Scout life,

17:58.787 --> 18:01.414
you're right.
We got to do something.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.669
How you doing, Mr. Artist?

18:06.753 --> 18:09.589
Not good. Now I got
to add tape to my list.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.549
I just don't know why

18:11.633 --> 18:13.301
the C-Sections can't
take this more seriously.

18:13.384 --> 18:16.596
'Cause it's okay to fuck around
every once in a while.

18:16.679 --> 18:19.182
Look, Tru, you think
Prince was born Prince?

18:19.265 --> 18:21.559
Prince wasn't shit
when he started out.

18:21.643 --> 18:24.312
Actually, Trini, Prince signed
a record deal at 19,

18:24.395 --> 18:25.980
and played all 27 instruments

18:26.064 --> 18:27.982
on his 1978 debut album,
<i>For You,</i>

18:28.066 --> 18:31.069
and he negotiated owning
his own masters, so...

18:31.152 --> 18:32.445
Doggone Wikipedia.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.739
The truth is,
being shitty at something

18:34.823 --> 18:36.574
is the only way
you get good at it.

18:36.658 --> 18:37.992
Aren't you embarrassed
to be performing

18:38.076 --> 18:39.536
with a bunch of winos?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.079
Like, for real,
Other Barb has a problem.

18:41.162 --> 18:44.207
I do it 'cause it's fun,
not 'cause it's good.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.125
There's value in that, too.

18:46.209 --> 18:49.170
Damn! How did you get
so wise, Trini?

18:49.254 --> 18:51.673
Did you pick that up
from Prince?

18:51.756 --> 18:53.675
Nope. It's a mom thing,

18:53.758 --> 18:55.885
but he did teach me how
to make a French omelet.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.972
Hold up. Did you and Prince,
uh, smash?

18:59.055 --> 19:00.515
Boy, if you don't
get the hell out of here.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.475
You think I'm talking
to you about my sex life?

19:02.559 --> 19:05.687
Ugh. Okay. Listen,
if you want to have some fun,

19:05.770 --> 19:07.355
we'll be waiting for you.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.065
If you want to take care
of your little movie list,

19:09.148 --> 19:10.608
that's cool, too.

19:13.236 --> 19:14.779
I don't know, Dr. J.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.781
I mean, what if
it's a sample sale,

19:16.865 --> 19:18.241
and all of the good jackets
are taken?

19:18.324 --> 19:20.159
Here's the thing, Derica.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.537
Jacket DesJacket said
that jackets are generally

19:22.620 --> 19:23.955
- jacket by jacket.
- What?!

19:24.038 --> 19:26.666
Yo! Come on.
This is fucked up!

19:31.379 --> 19:34.007
Aah! My arms!

19:37.552 --> 19:41.222
Hey, you okay? You passed out
from heat stroke. Here.

19:41.306 --> 19:44.267
Hi. Thanks.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.810
We had to cut your jacket off.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.729
Oh, no! Stop!
Don't look at me!

19:47.812 --> 19:49.355
I'm nothing
without my jacket.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.024
I don't know.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.650
I think it looks pretty sweet
as a vest.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.194
Ah.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.071
Thanks.
I'm Jacket.

19:57.155 --> 19:58.698
I mean, I'm Derica.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.116
Harmony.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.414
Flea people,

20:06.497 --> 20:09.125
friends of the shade,
Slim Shadys,

20:09.208 --> 20:13.671
played-out, <i>Lion King</i> DVD
peddlers, lend me your ears!

20:13.755 --> 20:17.216
We've been told our time
in the sun would come!

20:17.300 --> 20:20.553
We've waited patiently.
And for what?

20:20.637 --> 20:24.933
For Selena Gomez to show up
at the VMAs wearing our shit?!

20:26.601 --> 20:28.227
We don't need Selena
to tell us what's dope!

20:28.311 --> 20:30.772
- We know what's dope!

20:30.855 --> 20:32.815
Tell 'em, little bruh.
Tell 'em!

20:32.899 --> 20:34.817
Fuck the circle of hype.

20:34.901 --> 20:38.071
- It's time we take action.

20:38.154 --> 20:42.951
Today, we reclaim the sun!
Now who's with me?!

20:43.034 --> 20:44.953
- Yeah!

20:45.036 --> 20:46.621
Let's show the world

20:46.704 --> 20:49.248
that our brands won't go down
without a fight!

20:49.332 --> 20:51.417
- Fuckin' kill em!
- Yeah!

20:51.501 --> 20:54.295
And I'm taking
these <i>Playboys</i> with me.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.806
Okay, guys,
let's fuck some shit up!

21:07.517 --> 21:10.269
How we doing, flea market?

21:10.353 --> 21:12.563
We're Trini
and the C-Sections!

21:14.565 --> 21:18.945
And proudly,
on backup Talk Box, me, Truman!

21:19.028 --> 21:20.571
Ey, sorry I'm late, y'all.

21:20.655 --> 21:21.990
I couldn't get
through the entrance

21:22.073 --> 21:24.450
with that big-ass chip
on my shoulder, but we good now.

21:25.702 --> 21:28.621
- You ready to rock
with me, Fairfax?!

21:28.705 --> 21:31.958
Here's a buttery chard
for all the mamas out there.

21:41.676 --> 21:43.177
- Huh?

21:43.261 --> 21:45.430
What the hell?!

21:48.599 --> 21:49.600
Oh, my God!

21:49.684 --> 21:51.978
Die, Sunny Siders!

21:52.061 --> 21:56.149
- Charge!

21:56.232 --> 21:59.068
Yeah!

22:01.946 --> 22:04.699
Oppa Gangnam Style!

22:06.909 --> 22:09.037
Aah! Please don't kill me!

22:09.120 --> 22:12.665
Dale, look. With the hot swag
being sold next to old shit,

22:12.749 --> 22:14.834
all of the booths
have lost their value!

22:14.917 --> 22:19.088
I have no idea
what anything's worth anymore!

22:19.172 --> 22:21.174
Aha! We did it!

22:21.257 --> 22:22.800
Nothing can stop us!

22:25.470 --> 22:29.682
Shit! Rain!
Cover your wares!

22:32.977 --> 22:34.312
Dale, this way!

22:37.106 --> 22:39.317
Don't be a stranger, guys.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.152
Goodbye, Lorelai!

22:41.235 --> 22:43.279
See you on the Sunny Side.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.906
Thanks for saving me, Dale.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.574
No sweat.

22:46.657 --> 22:48.409
Guess who just made $20?

22:48.493 --> 22:51.871
Who wants to rock out to some
tunes and get absolutely soaked?

23:01.631 --> 23:05.134
- Rock out!

23:05.218 --> 23:06.803
<i>¡Que rico!</i>

23:56.894 --> 23:58.855
Chirp.
