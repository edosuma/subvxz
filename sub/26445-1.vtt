WEBVTT

00:08.133 --> 00:10.135
[all giggling]

00:10.510 --> 00:11.344
Oh, oh...

00:11.428 --> 00:15.598
Remember that time I tried to wash you,
and you were just like wet for three days?

00:15.682 --> 00:18.351
-So wet.
-Sopping wet.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.020
Yeah, and like so moldy?

00:20.103 --> 00:21.604
-Um, jealous much, bitch?
-What?

00:21.688 --> 00:25.775
God, I'm crushing on you so hard, Jay.
I never should've left.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.235
-Huge mistake.
-[tires screeching]

00:27.318 --> 00:29.863
All right, y'all.
This is as far north as I'm headin'.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.197
Jay, let's go.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.408
Jay, wait. The truck driver...

00:33.491 --> 00:35.535
-He uses me...
-Oh, God! For sex?

00:35.618 --> 00:36.995
-For lumbar support.
-Huh?

00:37.078 --> 00:40.665
And he has truck driver farts.
And all he eats is Arby's and Ritalin.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.834
Please, Jay, don't leave me.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.045
Oh, shit. Everybody wants me.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.963
God, this is a real Sofa's Choice.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.882
-Sophie's Choice.
-What? No, it's a sofa's--

00:48.965 --> 00:52.135
Okay, this is insane. I am a real person.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.428
That is a pillow.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.096
-Uh, you're right. You're right.
-Yeah.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.265
Pam, I'm so sorry,

00:57.348 --> 00:59.976
-but I... I really like Jessi...
-I see.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.187
And I need to see where this goes.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.105
Well... good luck, Jay.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.900
I guess we'll always have that time
in your mud room

01:06.983 --> 01:10.070
when your pit bull featuring Ludacris
licked your toes

01:10.153 --> 01:12.447
-right as we climaxed together.
-That was intense.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.115
What the fuck am I doing?

01:14.199 --> 01:15.533
-Goodbye, Pam.
-Bye, Jay.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.952
Scorpion,
you take care of your mom out there.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.120
[engine revs]

01:21.122 --> 01:22.457
Hey, just to be clear,

01:22.540 --> 01:24.626
that time in the mud room,
that was before we kissed.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.753
-Don't worry.
-Since then, I've only been with you

01:26.836 --> 01:28.046
-and my bath mat.
-Oh, God!

01:28.129 --> 01:29.756
-You don't need to tell me.
-You know what?

01:29.839 --> 01:31.674
I should read to you
from my jerk-off journal.

01:31.758 --> 01:32.842
-No!
-January 8th--

01:32.926 --> 01:34.636
-Jay!
-I woke up with a boner

01:34.719 --> 01:36.304
that could cut glass.

01:36.387 --> 01:37.305
[Jessi] Argh!

02:10.839 --> 02:12.882
Neither one of them is answering texts,

02:12.966 --> 02:16.052
and my mom says Jessi's parents
are full-on freaking out.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.762
It is weird that they're both missing.

02:17.846 --> 02:21.057
-You don't think they're together, do you?
-Jessi hates Jay.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.184
You never heard of a little thing
called hate fucking?

02:23.268 --> 02:24.644
-What?
-Like that show Moonlighting.

02:24.727 --> 02:27.147
Cybill Shepherd,
my college roommate, Bruce Willis.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.439
Bruce Willis went to college?

02:28.523 --> 02:30.900
Bar-tending college.
It's a three-week program.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.360
-So it's not college.
-It's called college.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.487
Looks like your uniform's getting
a little tight there, bud.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.698
Huh. It must've shrunk
in the dryer a little.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.325
Oh, you've blossomed,
and your meat has become girthy.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.537
And my uniform seems
to have gotten bigger somehow?

02:42.620 --> 02:44.873
-Is that even possible?
-You could wear it as a nightshirt.

02:44.956 --> 02:48.084
[whistling] All right. Here we go, team.
Big game today.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.546
You guys are gonna hear
a lot of trash talk out there.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.256
Moron, shitbag.

02:53.339 --> 02:56.301
You, Coach Steve, we're talking to you,
not the kids,

02:56.384 --> 02:58.303
-you moron shitbag.
-What?

02:58.386 --> 03:01.806
Okay, that's the pep talk.
Let's go do basketball.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.976
Andrew, I need you to gobble up
those sports, big man,

03:05.059 --> 03:08.688
because boy, oh boy,
you are a big man, you boy.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.231
Am I really that big?

03:10.315 --> 03:12.525
Perhaps this will tell of your girth.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.696
Ooh, tough one.

03:16.779 --> 03:19.616
Well, it's a deeply humiliating
start to the season

03:19.699 --> 03:23.286
as Bridgeton Middle is getting trounced
by a team with two black kids.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.872
-Ooh! No offense, Missy.
-Some taken, yeah.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.708
-[grunts]
-Damn it!

03:28.791 --> 03:30.210
When did everyone get so tall?

03:30.293 --> 03:32.503
When their glands released
androgens and hormones,

03:32.587 --> 03:34.881
triggering puberty-related growth spurts.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.841
Or maybe they drank a ton of milk.

03:36.925 --> 03:40.386
That's what I did, even though
I'm violently lactose intolerant.

03:40.470 --> 03:43.181
If I just smell milk, I puke diarrhea.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.726
-Argh!
-You're the man, Nick.

03:46.809 --> 03:48.394
You're doing awesome.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.314
-Are you blind?
-Yeah. I mostly just see shapes.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.941
Andrew! Get in the paint!

03:53.024 --> 03:54.901
They're all sweaty
and slimy to the touch.

03:54.984 --> 03:58.279
Use your freakishly large body
for some good!

03:58.363 --> 04:00.406
He's like Andre the Giant
with none of the charisma.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.743
-Yeah, throw some elbows, big man.
-Stop calling me big man!

04:03.826 --> 04:07.038
If you have a pair of binoculars,
you may notice Nick Birch,

04:07.121 --> 04:10.208
a squirrel of a boy dribbling the ball
across half-court.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.918
-[grunts]
-[buzzing]

04:12.001 --> 04:13.127
Son-of-a-bitch!

04:13.211 --> 04:15.088
Hey, Nick, don't be so hard on yourself.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.965
You know, we may have lost by 26,

04:17.048 --> 04:18.716
but nobody called me a name.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.094
Hey! Coach Steve! You're a shitbag!

04:21.177 --> 04:24.097
[chuckles]
Okay, I jinxed it. That one's on me.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.431
[retching]

04:25.515 --> 04:27.475
Did somebody bring a Go-Gurt in here?

04:27.558 --> 04:28.685
[giggling]

04:28.768 --> 04:31.229
[man] And the Go-Gurt burglar
strikes again.

04:31.729 --> 04:33.147
So she emptied her piggy-bank,

04:33.231 --> 04:35.233
took some clothes,
and didn't come home last night?

04:35.316 --> 04:37.652
Sounds like a classic runaway there, ma.

04:37.735 --> 04:40.196
Any problems in the home life
there here now, ma'am?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.572
Well, we are separating.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.491
Because she cheated on me
with a woman.

04:43.574 --> 04:45.326
A woman who listens to me

04:45.410 --> 04:47.829
and doesn't have to put on
PornHub to have sex.

04:47.912 --> 04:50.081
Father uses PornHub...

04:50.164 --> 04:52.667
-not Brazzers.
-Brazzers's got two Z's.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.253
-Don't write that down.
-What's that have to do with our daughter?

04:55.336 --> 04:56.921
A lot of daughters end up on Brazzers.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.339
-Jesus Christ.
-Oh, Jesus! [sobs]

04:58.423 --> 05:00.383
No tears. It's a paid site.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.845
Jesus Christ, Dumont,
you gotta work on your bedside manner.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.847
Folks, we're gonna find
your dead daughter.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.432
-[sobbing]
-Question.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.393
You got a pair of her panties
for the cadaver dogs?

05:10.476 --> 05:12.061
Where is our girl?

05:12.145 --> 05:13.855
These pooches take a wiff of genitals,

05:13.938 --> 05:16.107
they'll find her faster
than when it's Milk-Bone day.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.777
-Ugh, I sucked today.
-You did great, man.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.904
I couldn't get a shot off. I'm too small.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.281
You smell great.

05:23.364 --> 05:26.951
I said, I'm small. I'm not growing.
Is there something wrong with me?

05:27.035 --> 05:29.329
No, man, you need to relax.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.456
Maybe you should, you know...

05:31.539 --> 05:32.874
-What?
-You know...

05:32.957 --> 05:35.543
What is that? Grind fresh peppers?

05:35.668 --> 05:37.503
No! Masturbate!

05:37.587 --> 05:39.547
-But I like your instinct.
-Oh!

05:39.630 --> 05:41.716
I've never really done that before.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.801
Go for it, Nick. It'll be a hoot!

05:43.885 --> 05:45.803
You're so positive, man.
I respect that about you.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.638
Okay, let's see.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.724
[pubic hair 1]
Ow! Nick, that doesn't feel right.

05:49.807 --> 05:51.267
[hair 2] You trying to give
your dick an Indian burn?

05:51.351 --> 05:52.352
It's not working.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.937
-This doesn't feel good.
-Oh, you're doing great!

05:55.021 --> 05:58.399
Twist harder and faster,
and flick your balls.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.735
-Don't listen to him!
-You're gonna break your dick, Nick!

06:00.818 --> 06:04.906
Now, pull your hands apart real fast,
like you're opening a telescope.

06:04.989 --> 06:07.033
-[pubic hair 1] Don't you dare!
-Everybody shut up!

06:07.116 --> 06:09.077
-[hair 2] You're gonna cum blood!
-Shut up!

06:09.160 --> 06:11.704
Whatever is supposed
to be happening isn't happening.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.456
That was legendary, Nick.

06:13.539 --> 06:16.042
And always remember,
if it's numb,

06:16.125 --> 06:17.502
use your thumb.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.420
Put my thumb in my urethra?

06:19.504 --> 06:20.963
[chuckles]
What are you gonna do?

06:21.672 --> 06:24.133
Andrew, you've hardly touched
your salami and eggs.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.928
What's wrong?
Are you worried about Jay and Jessi?

06:27.011 --> 06:29.055
Oh, please. It's been 48 hours!

06:29.138 --> 06:31.057
We need to move on as a community.

06:31.140 --> 06:35.186
What this one should be worried about
is his ineffectiveness as a big man.

06:35.311 --> 06:38.189
-What a waste of length.
-Enough of the big man stuff, okay?

06:38.272 --> 06:41.442
Well, you are big! I mean, look at you.
You're the size of an uncle.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.861
I'm just trying to blend in and be normal.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.447
Normal?
You're a 12-year-old with a mustache.

06:46.531 --> 06:47.949
-Marty!
-Argh! Look at that thing!

06:48.032 --> 06:49.200
I can't eat.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.285
Is nobody gonna eat their salami and eggs?

06:51.369 --> 06:54.622
-Barbara, we've gotta fix him.
-Fix me?

06:54.705 --> 06:57.959
-I don't know about this, Marty.
-He's too young to have a mustache.

06:58.042 --> 06:59.585
[Barbara] It just seems cruel.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.547
-Whoa! What the hell are they doing?
-They're waxing my lip.

07:02.630 --> 07:03.506
-Jesus!
-Help, Maury.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.425
I'm gonna call a friend
to take care of this.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.635
I'll hold his head, you rip the thing off.

07:07.718 --> 07:10.179
-Bruce Willis, please.
-Mom, you don't have to do this.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.889
He's in asshole jail?

07:11.973 --> 07:13.558
I'm sorry, Andrew...

07:13.641 --> 07:16.102
Then how was he in
the last Expendables movie?

07:16.185 --> 07:18.438
Oh, they shot the whole movie in the jail?

07:18.521 --> 07:21.065
Right, 'cause they're all assholes.
Yeah, that makes sense.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.316
-Do it!
-[screams]

07:22.400 --> 07:24.402
No!

07:25.194 --> 07:28.197
My boy. Look how they massacred my boy.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.907
Mom, why would you do that?

07:29.991 --> 07:31.993
[sobbing]
Oh, my poor baby.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.329
For some reason, now I'm starving.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.000
-[man 1] I'll kill you.
-[man 2] Not if I kill you first.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.043
[man 1] Oh, you'll kill me?
I'll kill you so hard.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.587
Jay, this place is scary.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.548
I can't believe
I've been dealing Oxycotin with a liar.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.049
Hey! Knock it off!

07:47.133 --> 07:49.343
You're freaking out
my very serious girlfriend!

07:49.427 --> 07:51.429
-[man 1] Sorry about that, sir.
-[man 2] Sorry, sir.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.806
Sorry I called you my girlfriend.
I don't know what it is.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.100
I just... I want to protect
the shit out of you.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.768
No, it was okay.

07:57.852 --> 08:01.147
I weirdly kind of don't mind
the idea of being your girlfriend.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.982
If that's still what you want.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.151
-Yeah. A real life girlfriend?
-Yeah, I'm alive.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.944
-Who's not a pillow?
-I'm not a pillow.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.571
-Or a bath mat?
-Neither of those things.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.073
-That's a good thing, right?
-It should be.

08:12.700 --> 08:13.534
Hmm.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.286
Oh, yeah, I'm 40.

08:15.369 --> 08:16.871
Wait, what? You're 13.

08:16.954 --> 08:20.875
No, no, no. You know, in my brain,
for this, I'm 40.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.169
-Okay, see, the thing is, like--
-I'm a grown man.

08:23.252 --> 08:27.089
I'm 13, and so your fantasy about being 40
kind of makes this...

08:27.173 --> 08:28.925
-No!
-Like, super illegal and gross.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.551
-No!
-And I'm not interested in that.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.261
I understand that, but you're consenting.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.014
No, I could never give my consent
to a 40-year-old man.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.266
-That's the point.
-You're making a big deal out of this.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.143
This is just like
a Roman Polanski situation.

08:39.227 --> 08:42.146
-Yeah, he's a rapist. He raped a child.
-No, but I didn't give you a lewd.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.023
If you're 40, that makes you a pedophile.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.192
What? No! I'm not a--
Goddamnit, Jessi!

08:46.275 --> 08:48.444
Why won't you let me
be a 40-year-old magician

08:48.528 --> 08:49.820
with a white gold Rolex?

08:49.904 --> 08:51.364
Because you're not, you psycho!

08:51.447 --> 08:52.740
-I am not a psycho!
-[door closes]

08:52.823 --> 08:55.117
-[man 2] You sound like a psycho.
-I took that test,

08:55.201 --> 08:56.619
and it was negative!

08:57.328 --> 09:00.331
It's so smooth, like a dried dolphin.

09:00.414 --> 09:02.166
Don't touch it, okay? I'm hideous.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.584
I'm a big, hairy beast.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.712
Well, at least you can grow hair.
I'm like a Tic Tac with shoes.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.965
[sighs deeply]
Are we just a couple of freaks?

09:09.048 --> 09:10.675
No! You're the man!

09:11.384 --> 09:12.426
-Nick?
-Yeah?

09:12.510 --> 09:14.637
Do you remember when that fish stick
fell behind the fridge,

09:14.720 --> 09:16.556
and it was covered in hair and fungus,

09:16.639 --> 09:18.558
-and then we put a googly eye on it?
-I do.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.601
I'm quite certain
that fish stick is behind you.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.186
-You're the man.
-What the hell is that?

09:22.270 --> 09:24.772
And you're also the man, too, as well.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.316
-That's my hormone monster.
-That's your guy?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.485
Oh, no, Nick.
Maybe there is something wrong with you.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.696
That's what I've been saying! I need help.

09:31.779 --> 09:35.157
What about your guy? Maury?
Maybe I can switch or something.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.450
No, you don't want Maury.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.661
-He's the worst.
-Oh, what's that now?

09:38.744 --> 09:40.162
I thought we had fun together.

09:40.246 --> 09:44.208
Fun? My father waxed my lip
because you made me so grotesque.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.710
-I hate you.
-[Rick] Ouch!

09:45.793 --> 09:47.837
Thanks, Rick.
I thought it was pretty harsh, too.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.922
No, my horn unraveled.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.008
[mumbling]

09:52.717 --> 09:53.676
[crash]

09:53.759 --> 09:54.927
What are you gonna do?

09:55.011 --> 09:57.430
Ha-ha! Guy makes me laugh.
He's like Tracy Morgan.

09:57.513 --> 10:00.266
I don't know if he knows he's being funny,
but he's fucking funny.

10:00.349 --> 10:01.851
[sobbing]

10:01.934 --> 10:02.852
[crying]

10:02.935 --> 10:04.020
What happened?

10:04.103 --> 10:05.980
We started kissing and he freaked out.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.399
-The kid's a little weirdo.
-Yeah, he's nuts.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.818
And you like him!
Why you like a little weirdo?

10:10.901 --> 10:12.069
I don't know!

10:12.153 --> 10:13.988
Ugh, what is wrong with me?

10:14.071 --> 10:17.575
[gasps] You're gonna be one of those
weak women who goes for bad guys

10:17.658 --> 10:20.453
with stupid brains and garbage dicks!

10:20.536 --> 10:21.996
Oh, my God!

10:22.079 --> 10:24.540
I'm going to end up living
in Tampa, Florida.

10:24.624 --> 10:29.045
And you're gonna have dirty-ass kids
with juice stains around their mouths.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.546
I think maybe we should go home.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.132
What?! And let your mom win? Never!

10:33.215 --> 10:37.261
Let's just relax and take ourselves
a nice, hot bubble bath.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.764
I can't.
There's a doll hand stuck in the drain.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.349
-No!
-Oh, God!

10:41.474 --> 10:44.685
Let's get Chick-fil-A
and not tell anybody.

10:44.769 --> 10:45.603
[hammering on door]

10:45.686 --> 10:47.396
Jessi! I'm sorry I freaked out!

10:47.521 --> 10:49.523
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I'm a mess!

10:49.607 --> 10:51.359
[woman] There's nothing
wrong with you, sweetheart.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.610
Huh? Who said that?

10:52.693 --> 10:55.446
-I did, daddy.
-Why are you calling me daddy?

10:55.529 --> 10:57.281
'Cause I'm dying to fuck you, silly.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.908
We're all dying to fuck you.

10:58.991 --> 11:02.036
We're motel pillows, sugar.
We're down for anything.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.120
But I'm with Jessi.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.373
But why? She's so difficult.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.959
And she doesn't understand that you're 40
and a celebrated magician...

11:09.043 --> 11:10.795
Who lives on the other end.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.088
Where is he?

11:12.171 --> 11:14.715
And we're also way into group sex.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.384
Oh, I'm really not--

11:16.467 --> 11:17.551
I could just watch.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.596
-Still, I don't think--
-Come on, fuck my wife.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.223
-Oh, boy.
-Yeah, fuck me.

11:22.306 --> 11:25.101
I'll just sit in the corner
like a sad cuck

11:25.184 --> 11:26.644
and play with my little tag.

11:26.727 --> 11:27.687
Look, man...

11:28.646 --> 11:29.522
Maybe.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.273
[Diane] Oh, sweetheart.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.609
You don't need a doctor.
You're just a late bloomer.

11:33.693 --> 11:38.197
Mom, I'm telling you, there's this, like,
disgusting thing inside of me.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.825
Like an old poop
that won't come out of your tushy?

11:40.908 --> 11:44.620
And I can't tell you about it
because you'll think I'm crazy,

11:44.704 --> 11:46.497
but, Mom, something is not right.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.916
Whatever you do,
don't use a grapefruit spoon

11:48.999 --> 11:50.543
to scoop that poop out

11:50.626 --> 11:53.170
'cause you're cruising
for a tushy bruising, baby.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.422
[bell ringing]

11:55.548 --> 11:57.466
-Hey, Andrew.
-Oh, hi, Missy.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.469
Holy smokes! What happened to your
sweet, little mustache you used to have?

12:00.553 --> 12:03.431
-My parents waxed it off.
-What? That's awful!

12:03.514 --> 12:05.725
I'm probably the last person
you wanna hear this from,

12:05.808 --> 12:07.560
but we need to love ourselves
for who we are.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.645
-Uh-huh.
-I'm in an online community

12:09.729 --> 12:12.690
called "Girls are Perfect and There's
Not a Thing Wrong with Any One of Them,

12:12.773 --> 12:15.526
and Anyone Who Would Tell You Otherwise
is Just Afraid of Your Power!"

12:15.609 --> 12:17.403
-All one name?
-It's great. We're all great.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.197
Hey, is there something like that,
but for pubescent boys?

12:20.281 --> 12:22.742
[chuckles]
Yeah, it's called society,

12:22.825 --> 12:25.453
you privileged white cis hetero male.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.830
-All right, bye.
-But I'm not white.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.666
I'm Jewish, which is worse to some people.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.044
-It's cold in here. Is anyone else cold?
-Jesus. What happened to you?

12:34.128 --> 12:36.046
I shaved in solidarity, brother.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.715
Like cancer day or Movember.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.884
You grow a mustache for Movember.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.218
I got mine waxed off.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.554
-Is there anything called Shave-uary?
-No.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.639
-What about Daylight Shavings Time?
-What?

12:45.723 --> 12:47.099
You gotta shave an hour earlier,

12:47.183 --> 12:49.185
but you get an extra hour
of shaving at night.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.102
[groans]

12:50.186 --> 12:53.397
All right, let's see. You are
in the fourth percentile for height.

12:53.481 --> 12:56.317
Oh, but, look at this,
the 80th percentile for head size.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.111
Oh, head's too big
and the body's too small.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.572
-Doctor Engle.
-All right, let's take a look downstairs.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.365
-Downstairs?
-Your testicles and penis.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.534
-Pretty please, drop your pants.
-Oh! Um...

13:05.618 --> 13:06.952
Oh, fine, I'll turn around.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.872
It's not like I haven't been washing
your penis for years.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.875
Okay. I see a few pubic hairs. Mazel tov.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.336
Nick, tell him about
when you tried to masturbate.

13:15.419 --> 13:18.005
It felt like you were molesting yourself,
you tiny little pervert.

13:18.088 --> 13:21.842
Dr. Engle, I read something online
about hormone therapy.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.427
Oh, you read about it online.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.387
Oh, wow. That's great.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.640
Hey, you know what?
Maybe you should be the doctor.

13:27.723 --> 13:28.557
Take my stethoscope.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.810
-Why would-- No, I don't want--
-No, please. I insist.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.269
-You are the doctor.
-I'm not--

13:32.353 --> 13:34.730
You can Google things
on WebMD or whatever.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.983
No, I'm just trying to understand
what's going on with my body.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.027
How about my diploma?
Do you wanna move in with my wife?

13:40.110 --> 13:41.445
Easy there, Dr. Engle.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.615
Look, maybe if you were 16,
I'd consider medical intervention,

13:44.698 --> 13:46.325
but you'll likely catch up in a few years.

13:46.408 --> 13:47.368
A few years?

13:47.451 --> 13:49.328
Are you in a big hurry
to sleep with my wife now?

13:49.411 --> 13:50.454
Is that what you're saying?

13:50.538 --> 13:52.289
-No.
-Go ahead! Enjoy my wife!

13:52.373 --> 13:55.584
I hope you like somebody who spends
literally thousands of dollars on flowers.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.044
I don't know
where she gets these flowers.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.672
-Can I pull my pants up, please?
-I don't know, Wendy. Can you?

13:59.755 --> 14:02.633
-I think his wife's name is Wendy.
-No, that's my first name.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.134
-Dr. Wendy Engle.
-What?

14:04.218 --> 14:06.220
You, you're Wendy.
You're Dr. Wendy Engle?

14:07.346 --> 14:08.430
What am I gonna do?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.140
-Oh, hey, Nick!
-Coach Steve?

14:10.266 --> 14:12.518
How about an awkward reaching fist bump,
my dude?

14:12.601 --> 14:15.437
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, I still go to the pediatrician.

14:15.521 --> 14:19.233
I'm what's known in the medical community
as a man baby.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.527
You're the man baby, Steve.

14:21.610 --> 14:24.822
Wait. You're coach Steve's hormone
monster, too? But he's a grown up.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.366
No bragsies but, you know, I'm special.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.993
You're special, too, Nick.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.828
-Very special.
-Oh, God.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.163
You need to relax,
if you know what I mean.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.124
Put a little pepper on that salt, baby.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.667
Oh, my God. This is a nightmare.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.919
Yeah, but be careful.
Don't twist too hard,

14:39.003 --> 14:40.713
or salsa will come out.

14:40.796 --> 14:44.258
Spoiler alert: It's extra spicy, so...

14:49.096 --> 14:50.806
-Stop it!
-What the hell?

14:50.890 --> 14:54.351
We don't have enough money for the check.
Why'd you order Hungarian meatballs?

14:54.435 --> 14:55.853
-It sounded funny.
-Argh!

14:55.936 --> 14:58.063
Hold on.
I might have some change in my bag.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.773
-Hey, daddy.
-What is that?

14:59.857 --> 15:02.151
-Nothing.
-Is that a pillow from the motel?

15:02.234 --> 15:04.778
She's just a friend, Jessi. Okay?

15:04.862 --> 15:07.197
-Really?
-Suzette was in a really bad situation.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.742
This sleazy couple
was using her good looks

15:09.825 --> 15:12.912
to lure in top magicians
to have orgies with them.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.497
You are out of your fucking mind.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.333
I can't believe I ran away with you.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.084
I can't believe I ran away with you.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.128
-You're always judging me.
-Excuse me?

15:21.211 --> 15:22.838
Making me feel bad about myself.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.215
-You are such a bitch!
-What?

15:25.299 --> 15:26.300
[truck honking]

15:26.383 --> 15:28.761
Come on, baby.
Let's get the hell out here.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.722
[exhales]
Jay, it's time to go home.

15:31.805 --> 15:35.517
Yeah... okay.
My folks are probably freaking out anyway.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.519
Jay! Dinner!

15:37.603 --> 15:39.104
[barking]

15:39.188 --> 15:41.315
Fat.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.067
Fat.

15:44.026 --> 15:44.944
[Nick] I'm doomed.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.987
I'm gonna end up a baby man,
like Coach Steve.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.197
Dude's a half-wit.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.367
He said the scale at the pediatrician's
was the best video game he ever played.

15:51.450 --> 15:54.745
-That was a good game.
-[grunts] I gotta take a leak.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.708
No!

16:00.292 --> 16:01.460
No!

16:01.543 --> 16:03.003
My pube!

16:04.964 --> 16:06.882
-Ah, he fell out!
-Nick...

16:06.966 --> 16:09.093
-Are you okay?
-Don't leave me here.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.094
Not like this, please.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.720
-Oh, my God.
-Is he dying?

16:11.804 --> 16:14.264
-Blow me into the toilet.
-Craig, don't talk like that.

16:14.348 --> 16:18.727
I don't want someone to come in here
and be like, "Ew, loose pube."

16:18.811 --> 16:19.895
[crying]

16:20.354 --> 16:21.480
I don't want to lose you.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.399
Do it for me.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.319
Goodbye!

16:27.945 --> 16:29.154
I'm never gonna forget--

16:29.238 --> 16:31.156
[toilet flushes]

16:31.240 --> 16:34.368
Nick, you're supposed to be growing
more pubic hair,

16:34.451 --> 16:36.036
not losing the ones you have!

16:36.120 --> 16:38.455
-What the hell is wrong with me?
-You're going backwards,

16:38.539 --> 16:41.417
and your hormone monster
is in complete denial.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.503
-I don't know what to do.
-We've gotta get rid of him,

16:44.586 --> 16:47.172
and we've gotta do it now
before it's too damn late.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.674
[door creaks]

16:49.216 --> 16:52.386
[snoring]

16:52.803 --> 16:54.638
Look at him. He's wretched.

16:54.722 --> 16:55.639
I know.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.975
Hey, you know what you should do?

16:58.058 --> 17:01.311
Take your pillow
and smother him until he's dead!

17:01.395 --> 17:04.189
What? I can't kill my own hormone monster.
He's all I have.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.315
[laughing]

17:05.399 --> 17:08.193
We'll get you a new one, buddy.
A better one!

17:08.277 --> 17:10.863
And you'll have a great big bushels
of pubic hair,

17:10.946 --> 17:12.448
and you'll be coming all day long.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.034
That does sound nice, in theory, but...

17:15.117 --> 17:16.702
-No, I can't.
-So, what?

17:16.785 --> 17:18.620
You're just gonna have
a little toddler crotch?

17:18.704 --> 17:20.581
Is that what you want,
you little crotch toddler?

17:20.664 --> 17:22.249
-No!
-So then do it.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.295

17:26.378 --> 17:28.297
I'm sorry. I have to.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.382
Please, stop!

17:31.050 --> 17:32.134
He's leaking.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.428
[pubic hair]
Shut the fuck up, Nick! Kill him.

17:34.511 --> 17:35.596
Please!

17:35.721 --> 17:38.474
-Think of everything he's done to you.
-I know, but--

17:38.557 --> 17:39.558
Silence him forever!

17:39.641 --> 17:42.061
Argh! I can't. I can't do it.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.312

17:43.395 --> 17:45.272
Oh, God. What am I gonna do?

17:45.355 --> 17:47.983
Fuck you, man.
Fuck with me, I fuck with you.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.651
Nah, man, I love you, brother.

17:49.735 --> 17:53.072
You're crazy, but I love you, you know?
I'm not going anywhere.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.115
You know, ride and die, baby, woo!

17:55.699 --> 17:58.994
Marty, I'm feeling guilty
about waxing Andrew's lip.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.622
What? It's crazy. That already happened.

18:01.705 --> 18:03.290
We should've just let him be.

18:03.373 --> 18:06.543
He's too developed for his age.
The kid's a freak!

18:06.627 --> 18:09.671
What kind of a man would say that
about his own son?

18:09.755 --> 18:12.549
Maybe he's just not ready
for his little boy to grow up.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.843
Either that or he's a complete bunghole.

18:14.927 --> 18:15.803
Can we go inside?

18:15.886 --> 18:18.388
I know that people can't see me,
but I feel kind of exposed.

[doorbell ringing]

18:20.599 --> 18:22.101
-Jessi!
-Hey, guys.

18:22.184 --> 18:25.395
-Oh, thank God. Where were you?
-We were so scared.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.439
I know. I'm really sorry.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.566
-We're sorry.
-We need to do better.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.360
We love you so much.
[kisses]

18:31.443 --> 18:33.779
-We promise we're going to work this out.
-Yes.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.405
-You're gonna get back together?
-Well...

18:35.489 --> 18:37.908
Oh, honey. No, no, no, no.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.118
One "no" is fine, Shannon.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.162
I meant we'll find our way through this.
All of us.

18:42.246 --> 18:45.541
-You and me and your dad--
-Cantor Dina. Don't forget about her.

18:45.624 --> 18:48.836
-And your father's pot dealer, Edgar.
-I never took a bath with Edgar.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.671
No, you just buy dime bags from him.

18:50.754 --> 18:53.382
Grams, Shannon.
You sound so old right now.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.634
And Edgar's main business
is window tinting, by the way.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.052
Our point, Jessi...

18:57.136 --> 18:58.428
-Jessi?
-Where'd she go?

18:58.804 --> 19:02.307
Oh! Look at her.
I'm so glad she's home.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.893
I know. I thought for sure
we were going to get a finger

19:04.977 --> 19:06.770
or a little shoe in the mail or something.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.272
-Jesus, Greg!
-What?

19:08.355 --> 19:10.107
I'm saying, like, I'm psyched.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.776
Not psyched, but like, you know, relieved.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.695
No, you know, what?
I'm fucking psyched.

You can stop your crying. Jay's back.

Well, then,
who's been using the elliptical?

19:21.201 --> 19:23.662

20:53.669 --> 20:55.879
we'll perform oral sex
