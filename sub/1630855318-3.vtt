00:00.217 --> 00:03.133
Previously, on
"The Real Housewives
of Atlanta"...

00:03.133 --> 00:05.396
You ready?
Hit the ball.

00:05.396 --> 00:07.268
Yay!
- Good job, Brookie!

00:07.268 --> 00:09.444
Hey.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.185
Yeah, that's fire.
Who did the tracks?

00:11.185 --> 00:12.664
I recently released
my new single.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.101
It's called
"You Already Know."

00:14.101 --> 00:15.624
I'm working on my EP.

00:15.624 --> 00:16.712
But, why now?

00:16.712 --> 00:18.018
Everything
I've been through,

00:18.018 --> 00:19.323
just I have so much
to talk about,

00:19.323 --> 00:21.325
so much to pour
my heart out about.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.501
Courtney says you
brought your hood out.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.810
Kandi shared a story
about it.

00:27.810 --> 00:31.466
The crowd...
ghetto!

00:31.466 --> 00:32.510
What did you say?

00:34.338 --> 00:35.252
- I wasn't disrespectful.
- He delete--

00:38.647 --> 00:40.170
What would you need
to get past this?

00:40.170 --> 00:41.693
We're gon' have to
agree to disagree.

00:42.825 --> 00:44.783
Recently, the boys and I
have been seeing a life coach.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.133
Aww.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.657
See? That's the love,
right there.

00:48.657 --> 00:51.181
She's showing me
a different way how to parent.

00:52.095 --> 00:54.793
Mmm.

00:54.793 --> 00:56.491
We can't.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.147
We don't know when we go
to Old Lady Gang

01:00.147 --> 01:02.149
if we're going to get
biscuits or bullets.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.719
My roots
are in Atlanta,

01:07.719 --> 01:09.417
but my branches
are worldwide.

01:11.723 --> 01:14.465
Forget the gaslight,
I'm taking the spotlight.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.469
My past may be checkered,

01:18.469 --> 01:21.516
but my future
is solid gold.

01:21.516 --> 01:24.127
I just don't do it
for the culture.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.303
Honey, I am the culture.

01:26.303 --> 01:28.175
She by Sheree,
more like,

01:28.175 --> 01:31.091
"She broke the internet."

01:31.091 --> 01:32.875
If you can't keep
the pace,

01:32.875 --> 01:35.443
stay out of my race.

01:39.142 --> 01:41.579
♪ I'm the king
of the world ♪

01:41.579 --> 01:45.148
♪ give me my flowers
while I'm here right now ♪

01:45.148 --> 01:48.804
♪ ain't ever here to back down
to the odds ♪

01:48.804 --> 01:52.721
♪ I lost at times
but never lost my crown ♪

01:52.721 --> 01:54.723
Oh,
I see it's coming together.

01:56.333 --> 01:59.162
I have a few girlfriends
I'm having over for brunch.

01:59.162 --> 02:00.729
So, we got some fruit.
We got the salmon.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.252
We got lobster tail.

02:02.252 --> 02:04.254
You also have some
French toast,

02:04.254 --> 02:05.560
and I have
some scrambled eggs.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.257
I might need to get
some more bottles

02:07.257 --> 02:09.216
because Marlo can drink
two of these by herself.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.782
Oh, yeah, she gonna finish
that by herself.

02:18.442 --> 02:21.793
- Yes! How are you?
- Hello. I am good.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.230
- Wait, you have food.
- Oh, yeah.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.710
Yeah, I can't just
let you guys come over

02:25.710 --> 02:27.190
and not have anything
for lunch.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.365
Oh, well, thank you.
This is awesome.

02:28.365 --> 02:29.888
Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.847
So, I'm doing, like,
a little brunch for you guys.

02:31.847 --> 02:33.849
- Have you recovered?
- No, I have not.

02:33.849 --> 02:36.417
Girl, I feel like
I needed a week off

02:36.417 --> 02:38.767
after BravoCon.
- Girl.

02:38.767 --> 02:39.985
Obviously, for me,

02:39.985 --> 02:41.465
it was fun to feel
the love from everybody,

02:41.465 --> 02:43.424
but them people
was chasing y'all down.

02:43.424 --> 02:45.208
- Girl.
- It was epic.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.601
Like, I-I loved it.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.699
Oh.

02:57.699 --> 03:00.745
Oh, Miss Marlo Hampton.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.530
Miss my boo-boo.
Ain't seen--

03:02.530 --> 03:03.705
Hey, baby girl,
looking good.

03:03.705 --> 03:06.273
- Hey, superstar!
- Looking good, girl.

03:06.273 --> 03:07.709
I got you some champagne

03:07.709 --> 03:09.232
'cause I know you love
to drink, chile.

03:09.232 --> 03:10.929
You know, I really am
trying to stop.

03:10.929 --> 03:14.368
Sani! Sani in the house!
- Yes! Hey, Marlo, baby.

03:14.368 --> 03:15.630
Yes, you look good, baby.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.632
- Cheers.
- Yay, cheers!

03:17.632 --> 03:19.460
I needed this.
I love you.

03:19.460 --> 03:20.983
Love you, too, girl.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.941
So, I just wanna
vent today.

03:22.941 --> 03:25.248
First of all, I didn't even
land until 3 in the morning.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.250
I'm in the airport
literally doing this,

03:27.250 --> 03:30.253
uh, project with William
on FaceTime.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.646
It's an argumentative paragraph,

03:31.646 --> 03:33.213
and we're arguing.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.867
I feel Miss Sharon has
helped a lot with the boys.

03:35.867 --> 03:39.784
The old Marlo would have
flipped out on William, okay?

03:39.784 --> 03:41.090
But the new Marlo,

03:41.090 --> 03:43.353
it's all about taking it in
before I react.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.007
But I love my baby.
He's one of a kind.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.138
But I was saying
how the fans

03:46.138 --> 03:48.489
were just going crazy
over you guys.

03:48.489 --> 03:49.794
Everybody was so positive.

03:49.794 --> 03:52.406
- Yes.
- Y'all saw Mama Joyce.

03:52.406 --> 03:55.626
Mama Joyce, say three
nice things about Todd.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.585
He's still short.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.674
Wait.

03:59.674 --> 04:02.416
At this point,
I'm shocked that Mama Joyce

04:02.416 --> 04:05.419
is still saying
negative things about Todd.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.638
So, all right, Kandi need
to stop talking about me.

04:07.638 --> 04:10.467
She needs to start fixing
what's going on under her roof

04:10.467 --> 04:12.643
because the streets
are talking,

04:12.643 --> 04:17.518
and the streets...
are your mama.

04:17.518 --> 04:20.347
What is up with her?
That's crazy.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.870
Wait, wait, wait.
So, when we're on the panel,

04:21.870 --> 04:23.437
what happened?
- So, wait, yes.

04:23.437 --> 04:24.829
So, here's what happened
with Drew.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.962
We go on stage and,
"Did I give you a hard time,

04:26.962 --> 04:28.659
"or did you come looking
for a hard time?"

04:28.659 --> 04:30.313
Did I give you
a hard time,

04:30.313 --> 04:34.622
or did you try
to pull a hard time for me?

04:34.622 --> 04:35.971
When I left the reunion,

04:35.971 --> 04:39.322
there was a lot unresolved
with Drew and I.

04:39.322 --> 04:41.324
She's flipping her hair
in my face, Andy.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.934
A couple weeks ago,
she sent me a text message

04:42.934 --> 04:44.893
saying she wanted to extend
an olive branch.

04:44.893 --> 04:47.069
But then to go on stage
and flip the script,

04:47.069 --> 04:48.549
she need to
cut the sh-- out with me

04:48.549 --> 04:49.854
because I'm over it.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.595
No, she was more
Michael Jackson with it--

04:51.595 --> 04:52.640
the one arm.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.032
She had the one hand
glove on.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.730
Did I say it, or did I--

04:55.730 --> 04:57.732
I'm like, girl,
where is your other damn glove?

05:00.691 --> 05:01.910
Girl, this food is good, chile.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.912
They got curry in it.

05:03.912 --> 05:05.609
So, I had to do somethin'
in my fulfillment center,

05:05.609 --> 05:07.524
and Kenya stopped by.

05:07.524 --> 05:10.397
We, of course, had to talk
about the Martell stuff,

05:10.397 --> 05:13.356
and, you know, she felt like
I was taking up for him.

05:13.356 --> 05:14.749
No, I'm taking up
for what's right.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.838
- Yeah.
- Like, he felt ambushed.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.580
I think it's important
that my friends respect Martell.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.059
This man is kind.

05:21.059 --> 05:25.586
He's funny, none of
the arrogance or cockiness

05:25.586 --> 05:28.676
that I see on his show
at all

05:28.676 --> 05:31.896
because I wouldn't be
attracted to that person.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.507
So, we agreed to disagree.

05:33.507 --> 05:35.073
I will say, sis,

05:35.073 --> 05:37.772
at first, I was not
so excited about Martell.

05:37.772 --> 05:40.078
I wasn't-- But it's like,
he's showing up.

05:40.078 --> 05:41.384
He's doing everything
people thought he wouldn't do.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.603
He picked me up
from the airport last night.

05:42.603 --> 05:43.821
I had a car service.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.432
Girl, that's when it is
good, good, good.

05:45.432 --> 05:46.781
Good, good.

05:46.781 --> 05:48.522
Ask, uh, Martell
to hook me up with someone.

05:48.522 --> 05:49.697
I gotta start dating.

06:06.104 --> 06:07.497
How you doin'?

06:07.497 --> 06:08.585
Have y'all ever been here
before?

06:08.585 --> 06:10.544
- No.
- So, day passes?

06:10.544 --> 06:11.762
- Yes.
- Awesome.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.155
Are these
gym shoes okay?

06:13.155 --> 06:14.765
'Cause these are so cute.
You know what I'm sayin'?

06:14.765 --> 06:16.550
Like, this is a date.

06:16.550 --> 06:17.986
- Appreciate the outfit.
- I love it.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.466
But rentals might do you
a little bit better

06:19.466 --> 06:21.032
on the wall.
- Rent, okay.

06:21.032 --> 06:22.077
- I don't want you to fall.
- No, I'm trying to be safe.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.165
I'm definitely
trying to be safe.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.428
Like, that would be
a bad look.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.560
Yeah, baby.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.605
The last year,
things got a little rocky

06:28.605 --> 06:30.085
between Ralph and I,

06:30.085 --> 06:32.522
and we started seeing Dr. Ken
for marriage counseling.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.524
This is, like,
a dating opportunity.

06:34.524 --> 06:37.440
I am committing
to your process.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.182
Even though Ralph and I
have gotten to a great place,

06:40.182 --> 06:41.488
we wanna keep it
that way,

06:41.488 --> 06:44.099
and since we love
a good challenge,

06:44.099 --> 06:46.449
what better date than to do
something we both love

06:46.449 --> 06:48.451
and add a little
competition in it?

06:48.451 --> 06:50.540
Okay, this is a good one
to start off on, okay?

06:50.540 --> 06:51.759
You're gonna clip into
that blue loop.

06:51.759 --> 06:52.803
So, this is
the easiest here.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.196
- Yes, yeah.
- Okay.

06:54.196 --> 06:56.764
Ready, one,
two, three, go. Go.

06:56.764 --> 07:00.420
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
- Okay, don't fall.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.639
Come on, baby.
You got this.

07:02.639 --> 07:05.076
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God-- No, my nail.

07:05.076 --> 07:07.557
Ahh! Oh, my God.
- Kick your legs out.

07:07.557 --> 07:08.863
Kick your legs so you don't
run into the wall.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.908
Jesus, Drew!

07:10.908 --> 07:12.040
That was so hard.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.520
Nobody prepared me
for how hard--

07:13.520 --> 07:14.259
Yeah, let's switch it.

07:16.479 --> 07:17.915
- Let's go.
- Right foot, go.

07:17.915 --> 07:20.701
Yeah.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.485
Look at me.

07:22.485 --> 07:23.486
You're going
faster than me.

07:23.486 --> 07:27.577
Oh! Ahh.

07:27.577 --> 07:31.059
Ahh! Yes!

07:31.059 --> 07:32.887
You made it to the top.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.062
Now, how do I go down,
so I don't hurt myself?

07:34.062 --> 07:36.151
Just jump.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.674
Oh! Whoa, whoa.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.110
Jesus.
Oh, my God, Drew!

07:39.110 --> 07:40.503
Drew, you're supposed
to stay straight.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.810
Oh, oh, my God.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.072
It was definitely fun.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.856
This was amazing.

07:45.856 --> 07:48.076
I gotta bring the kids back.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.078
Jo-Jo, he could definitely
be doing this.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.514
Yeah.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.734
Now that I'm adding
music on my plate,

07:53.734 --> 07:58.521
how do you feel about me going
from being with the kids 100%,

07:58.521 --> 08:01.916
being a true housewife,
back to my career?

08:01.916 --> 08:03.526
That was always the plan
from the beginning.

08:03.526 --> 08:06.007
It'll be like
Ike and Tina.

08:06.007 --> 08:07.922
No, no, no, not crazy Ike,
like regular.

08:07.922 --> 08:08.966
Why would you say--
last time I checked,

08:08.966 --> 08:11.142
Ike was on Tina.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.580
Ralph definitely hit his head
on one of those rocks

08:13.580 --> 08:15.538
coming down because
I thought we were

08:15.538 --> 08:18.933
Beyonce and Jay Z,
but he's saying Ike and Tina.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.543
I'm not eating the cake,
Anna Mae.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.592
So, I checked
the numbers.

08:25.592 --> 08:28.203
The song is at 30,000
streams, right now.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.729
Yeah, it's bad.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.078
That's bad?
No, it's not.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.645
I thought that was
pretty good.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.560
It's excellent
for how we did it,

08:37.560 --> 08:38.953
but there really wasn't
no marketing

08:38.953 --> 08:40.345
and a strategy behind it,
you know.

08:40.345 --> 08:41.608
But that-- and so,
I'm glad you brought that up

08:41.608 --> 08:44.132
because I feel like
you put the song out,

08:44.132 --> 08:47.004
and then you just kinda
went back to work.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.921
We need to, like,
push the song.

08:50.921 --> 08:53.054
I want it to be a hit.
I already see it.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.534
I wanna take it as far
as it can go.

08:56.144 --> 08:58.625
I mean, look, my hands
is in a lot of places.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.583
I've taken the record
to a certain point.

09:00.583 --> 09:01.802
We worked great
as a team.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.064
That was amazing.
- Was-was amazing.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.153
And so, I also need
to focus on the things

09:05.153 --> 09:06.676
I need to go and do.

09:08.243 --> 09:09.984
Music has been
really a testament

09:09.984 --> 09:11.638
to how we fell in love.

09:11.638 --> 09:18.819
♪ Lord give me you

09:18.819 --> 09:20.560
Working on music together

09:20.560 --> 09:22.300
has kinda brought us back to
the genesis of our relationship,

09:22.300 --> 09:24.738
but now Ralph is
kind of pulling his self

09:24.738 --> 09:26.870
out of this journey that
we were on together,

09:26.870 --> 09:28.568
and I don't really know
where it's coming from.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.179
I hope it doesn't put
a wedge between us.

09:31.179 --> 09:33.573
It's kinda sad,
but I didn't see it coming.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.575
Now, people are watching to see,
okay, is it gonna fail?

09:35.575 --> 09:37.141
Is it gonna succeed?

09:37.141 --> 09:39.970
You know, I wanna be performing
at Bravo Con next year.

09:39.970 --> 09:41.581
I wanna be on the stage.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.018
Like, Bravo Con
was so lit.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.672
Somebody came up to me,
and they was like,

09:45.672 --> 09:47.935
"Ralph, gaslight me.
Gaslight me."

09:47.935 --> 09:49.937
Ralph, gaslight me!

09:56.073 --> 09:57.945
Coming up...

09:57.945 --> 10:00.208
My blood nephew is dead,

10:00.208 --> 10:01.775
and you're talking about acting.
- Feel-- but feel--

10:01.775 --> 10:03.037
but if-- but feel--
- No, you're acting, though.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.125
you!

10:04.125 --> 10:05.909
My nephew is dead, bitch!

10:16.441 --> 10:18.313
Did you upload
the right file?

10:18.313 --> 10:19.488
What is the issue?

10:23.884 --> 10:25.450
No, he should
have resized it.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.191
Call him, please.

10:27.191 --> 10:29.716
It's always a hassle.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.848
It's still not
the right size.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.154
Oh, come on.

10:33.154 --> 10:35.156
I just put it at
the same size the agent sent.

10:35.156 --> 10:38.028
No, no, no.
I needed you to size it

10:38.028 --> 10:40.378
in the exact dimensions
that she sent you,

10:40.378 --> 10:43.120
and I need it
in three minutes, please.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.556
I know I'm a boss,

10:44.556 --> 10:47.255
but when it comes to
these people that work for me,

10:47.255 --> 10:51.041
I feel like I often
am a mentor.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.173
I don't understand.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.565
Why didn't you do it
the first time?

10:53.565 --> 10:55.829
I have a lot of patience,

10:55.829 --> 10:59.049
and I have a soft spot
for young people.

10:59.049 --> 11:02.357
And it's also
low----ing resolution.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.054
I just do.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.449
Hey, girl.
- Hi.

11:09.103 --> 11:11.192
I'm in my brand color
because I just had

11:11.192 --> 11:13.455
a meeting with my team.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.065
So, I'm gonna miss you
because I know

11:15.065 --> 11:16.458
you're going to--

11:20.897 --> 11:22.116
Oh.

11:22.116 --> 11:24.422
I'm doing
this surprise performance

11:24.422 --> 11:27.295
focused on HBCUs.

11:27.295 --> 11:30.080
I would love for you
to choreograph it for me.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.438
The Magic City Classic
is a huge

11:40.438 --> 11:41.962
annual football game.

11:41.962 --> 11:43.790
They have asked me
to perform.

11:43.790 --> 11:46.357
So, I had this brilliant idea
to do a collaboration

11:46.357 --> 11:49.143
with their band
for Kenya Moore Haircare.

11:49.143 --> 11:52.363
And since Monyetta is
a very good choreographer,

11:52.363 --> 11:56.324
I need her to bring
Keyonce up to speed

11:56.324 --> 11:58.500
and be in full effect, honey.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.458
We want hair.
We want movement.

12:00.458 --> 12:01.808
Girl, we want all of that.

12:03.679 --> 12:06.595
Oh, my God,
I'm so excited. Yes!

12:20.391 --> 12:22.959
Oh, what's up, DonJuan?

12:22.959 --> 12:24.308
Wow, this outfit.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.180
My husband is
back in town,

12:26.180 --> 12:28.051
so we're going to the game.
- This what the social media
content--

12:28.051 --> 12:29.487
You're gonna sit
courtside with that?

12:29.487 --> 12:30.967
You want them to win,
don't you?

12:30.967 --> 12:33.361
Anyway...

12:33.361 --> 12:35.102
Come on, let's go
to the office

12:35.102 --> 12:36.625
'cause I really wanna
list out

12:36.625 --> 12:39.149
the stuff that we need
to be getting prepared for,

12:39.149 --> 12:40.890
and I just feel like
we just be

12:40.890 --> 12:42.849
running by the seat of
our pants sometimes.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.112
Well, so, we
map out the musts.

12:45.112 --> 12:46.635
Let's do that.
- All right.

12:46.635 --> 12:47.984
We know, every week,

12:47.984 --> 12:50.291
you already have to go
live for Amazon.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.641
- Podcast.
- Return of Kandi Coated
Nights podcast.

12:52.641 --> 12:54.425
- The Soul Train awards.
- Soul Train awards.

12:54.425 --> 12:56.253
Ebony Power 100.

12:56.253 --> 12:58.125
- Our Kandi Cares events.
- Blaze's birthday.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.518
- Celebrity Game Face.
- Oh, Porsha's wedding
is that week.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.129
Oh, don't y'all
have a restaurant

13:02.129 --> 13:03.347
that you're building?

13:03.347 --> 13:05.697
This must list is
getting pretty long.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.134
That's my point.

13:07.134 --> 13:09.963
Then I'm trying
to do this movie

13:09.963 --> 13:11.051
with Todd.
- With Todd.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.489
Todd and I discussed
I'm not gonna be the lead

13:14.489 --> 13:15.969
in his movie.
- Okay.

13:15.969 --> 13:17.884
Todd's movie, "The Pass,"

13:17.884 --> 13:19.276
is something that
he's been wanting to do

13:19.276 --> 13:21.017
for some years now.

13:21.017 --> 13:24.020
I wanna participate as
an executive producer,

13:24.020 --> 13:26.196
and I don't want
to be the lead

13:26.196 --> 13:28.155
because people feel like,
oh, yeah, they're just gonna

13:28.155 --> 13:29.678
produce it so she
can be the lead.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.375
I will say this.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.638
If you're saying you're
going to be a part,

13:33.638 --> 13:36.990
then having just as much
of an active role

13:36.990 --> 13:39.470
as you push him to have on
the projects that you want,

13:39.470 --> 13:41.037
is gonna be very important.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.343
No, I-I feel
what you're sayin'.

13:42.343 --> 13:43.561
I'm-I'm--

13:43.561 --> 13:45.302
- Knock-knock-knock.
- Hey, how are you?

13:45.302 --> 13:47.000
Hey, Miss Broadway.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.218
Ooh, yes.
- Look at you.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.481
How you doin'?
- You look lovely.

13:50.481 --> 13:53.180
Listen, right here,
for you.

13:53.180 --> 13:57.010
Our red carpet at
"The Piano Lesson" was lit.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.099
When I tell you, it was
a dream come true,

13:59.099 --> 14:01.144
dream come true.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.407
I was devastated when "Thoughts
of a Colored Man" closed,

14:03.407 --> 14:05.366
but I knew that
I wanted to produce

14:05.366 --> 14:07.063
another Broadway show.

14:07.063 --> 14:08.543
And so, now

14:08.543 --> 14:11.154
Todd and I both are producers
on "The Piano Lesson."

14:11.154 --> 14:14.418
Todd has a background
in film and television,

14:14.418 --> 14:17.987
so he's helping me to make
my way to the EGOT.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.597
I'm so happy
for you, Kandi.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.251
You deserve
all of this and some.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.557
Thank you.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.080
The Bravo Con, like,
how did everything go?

14:24.080 --> 14:25.386
Okay, I gotta
hear everything.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.083
Bravo Con, I thought
that it was a weekend

14:27.083 --> 14:28.563
of, like, celebrating.
- Yeah.

14:28.563 --> 14:32.436
But it seemed like
every time we got on stage,

14:32.436 --> 14:34.047
the bullsh-- happened.
- Something happened.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.483
- The bullsh--.
- Yeah.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.746
So, my mom and I were on
the Dynamic Duos panel.

14:37.746 --> 14:39.443
Okay.

14:39.443 --> 14:42.055
Kandi, who would you trust
more to control your money,

14:42.055 --> 14:44.971
Mama Joyce or DonJuan?

14:44.971 --> 14:48.017
I don't think my mom would be
very nice to my husband,

14:48.017 --> 14:51.281
so I'd have
to say DonJuan.

14:51.281 --> 14:53.240
So, the next day,
Mama Joyce and them

14:53.240 --> 14:54.458
have to do their own panel,

14:54.458 --> 14:56.591
and they ask her
what type of man

14:56.591 --> 14:59.159
she would want
for her daughter.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.291
I-I probably would've
picked anyone

15:01.291 --> 15:05.426
that have a decent job.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.558
What?
He has a job.

15:07.558 --> 15:08.820
Oh.
- So, I left.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.213
I have not
called her since.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.259
Oh, how was Todd?

15:12.259 --> 15:15.001
What did bother him
was that

15:15.001 --> 15:16.828
Kaela was the one
who told him

15:16.828 --> 15:19.309
about what my mama said.

15:19.309 --> 15:20.267
Man...

15:23.270 --> 15:24.706
Yeah, Riley called me
about that, too.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.191
Have you ever said,

15:31.191 --> 15:33.323
"Mom, this is how
it makes me feel

15:33.323 --> 15:34.498
when you say those things?"

15:34.498 --> 15:35.935
Chile.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.545
You should just tell her
how you feel, for sure.

15:37.545 --> 15:40.461
It's upsetting that
she doesn't understand

15:40.461 --> 15:43.203
that one day
Ace may see it.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.074
Blaze may see it.

15:45.074 --> 15:48.077
They're gonna feel a way.
It's like come on, mama.

15:48.077 --> 15:49.209
Don't come with
that bullsh-- with me.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.688
I'm tired of it.

15:50.688 --> 15:53.561
I do not care
what you think

15:53.561 --> 15:55.084
about my husband,
at this point.

15:55.084 --> 15:57.695
Simple as that.

15:57.695 --> 16:00.524
I just need her to
respect my marriage.

16:00.524 --> 16:01.699
Please.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.745
This is too much.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.442
Coming up next...

16:07.444 --> 16:09.446
Yes, I'm so proud.

16:09.446 --> 16:12.710
Are you serious?

16:20.805 --> 16:23.721
Okay, so, cousin Courtney
is coming over.

16:23.721 --> 16:25.419
Are you excited?
- Of course.

16:25.419 --> 16:26.681
I talked to her earlier.

16:26.681 --> 16:27.812
We got the wine.
You know what I'm saying?

16:27.812 --> 16:28.683
She told me she loves
white wine.

16:28.683 --> 16:29.771
Uh-huh.

16:29.771 --> 16:32.600
This is
savo-savon blanc.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.123
- Sauvignon blanc.
- Sauvignon blanc--

16:34.123 --> 16:35.211
I knew that. I knew that.
I knew that.

16:35.211 --> 16:36.604
Good job, baby.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.171
Oh, my God, I just have
to make a good impression

16:38.171 --> 16:40.173
on cousin Courtney.
You know, it's family.

16:40.173 --> 16:41.739
And Ralph has been
talking to her a lot

16:41.739 --> 16:43.872
after they met
at Ross's party.

16:43.872 --> 16:46.135
Sheree, this is my cousin.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.442
- Shut up.
- Yeah, we just found out

16:48.442 --> 16:49.965
this, right now.
- It's so-- no.

16:49.965 --> 16:51.314
I wanna make sure
everything goes well,

16:51.314 --> 16:53.882
want Ralph bringing her
into the family fold.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.754
Hi, my baby!

16:56.754 --> 16:58.495
You look so pretty.
Did you do a twirl for daddy?

17:00.193 --> 17:01.542
- Hello!
- What is up?

17:01.542 --> 17:03.326
You look so pretty.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.504
Girl, we're about to have
a little family dinner.

17:08.897 --> 17:10.725
Candiace, what's good?
How you doin'?

17:11.900 --> 17:15.208
Candiace and Chris
we met in 2019.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.471
Both have a passion
in music and acting,

17:17.471 --> 17:20.517
and we actually spent
our seventh wedding anniversary

17:20.517 --> 17:21.823
with Chris and Candiace.

17:21.823 --> 17:23.999
So, she has really
become someone I consider

17:23.999 --> 17:25.479
a true friend.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.742
So, I'm actually
in your city, Drew.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.528
Girl, what you doing?

17:34.357 --> 17:35.706
- Yes, I'm so proud.
- Yes.

17:40.581 --> 17:43.584
♪ I sing

17:43.584 --> 17:48.328
♪ because I'm happy

17:48.328 --> 17:49.894
Ooh.

17:55.291 --> 17:58.338
Are you serious?

17:58.338 --> 17:59.513
Wait, wait, wait.
Did I just hear her say

17:59.513 --> 18:00.992
you're gonna-gonna
sing a song?

18:00.992 --> 18:02.646
- Hold on. I'm taking it in.
- You just got invited?

18:02.646 --> 18:04.822
My heart is beating so fast.
I just got so hot, right now.

18:04.822 --> 18:05.954
It's massive pressure.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.869
Like, I haven't been
in no rehearsals.

18:07.869 --> 18:11.438
I haven't even sang in a mic
in God knows how long.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.048
Most importantly,
I wanna show up for Candiace

18:13.048 --> 18:14.528
and really make her proud

18:14.528 --> 18:15.877
because she believes
in me so much,

18:15.877 --> 18:17.400
and this is
my big comeback moment.

18:18.923 --> 18:19.576
Okay.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.492
I'll send a text
to everybody, too,

18:22.492 --> 18:24.233
to let them know,
but it's gonna be lit, girl.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.539
Everybody gonna be
in the building.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.410
I need to do my
vocal exercises.

18:29.543 --> 18:32.720
Yeah, okay.
Okay, bye, babe.

18:34.417 --> 18:37.072
Ahh! Oh, my God!

18:37.072 --> 18:38.552
This is the moment,
right here.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.388
- Hey!
- Hi!

18:48.388 --> 18:50.781
- What's going on?
- What's up?

18:50.781 --> 18:53.393
- You look so good.
- So nice to meet you.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.830
How are you?
- I am so good.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.528
Good to see you.
This is Bryce.

18:58.528 --> 18:59.703
Bryce-- Drew.
- Oh, my God.

18:59.703 --> 19:00.922
What?

19:00.922 --> 19:04.012
Hey, cousin.
- Hey, cousin! What's good?

19:04.012 --> 19:06.841
- Oh, my God.
- You know him?

19:06.841 --> 19:08.669
- Shut up.
- We did a movie together.

19:08.669 --> 19:11.019
- Shut up.
- How many years ago?

19:11.019 --> 19:13.761
- Yeah, maybe ten.
- Y'all are dating?

19:16.503 --> 19:18.461
Shut your mouth,
right now.

19:18.461 --> 19:21.421
- Yes, my 24-year-old.
- Girl!

19:21.421 --> 19:22.900
Wait a minute.
You got a 24-year-old?

19:22.900 --> 19:24.380
I do.
I didn't tell you that?

19:24.380 --> 19:25.381
No.

19:25.381 --> 19:26.730
When Bryce and I met,

19:26.730 --> 19:28.776
he was one of the hottest
Black men in America.

19:28.776 --> 19:31.822
He was in the R group
Groove Theory.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.564
Bryce and I dated on
and off for 20 years,

19:34.564 --> 19:37.132
but now we are
strictly co-parents

19:37.132 --> 19:39.395
and amazing friends.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.528
- Welcome to our home.
- It's beautiful. Absolute--

19:41.528 --> 19:42.572
- Thank you.
- Yeah, this is-- this is--

19:42.572 --> 19:43.617
we call this
Pittman Palace here.

19:43.617 --> 19:45.096
First, we meet
cousin Courtney,

19:45.096 --> 19:47.882
and then we found out
that her baby's daddy

19:47.882 --> 19:50.406
is my long lost co-star,
Bryce Wilson.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.843
So, it is definitely
a divine connection,

19:52.843 --> 19:54.105
at this point.

19:54.105 --> 19:55.498
I got you white wine, 'cause--
- Thank you!

19:55.498 --> 19:57.065
Wait, we gotta start
with a shot first

19:57.065 --> 19:58.458
just to get the night going,
and then we can transition.

19:58.458 --> 19:59.763
- See? You gotta watch Ralph.
- Okay, all right.

19:59.763 --> 20:00.895
- We're gonna do tequila shots.
- All right.

20:00.895 --> 20:03.463
'Cause I just got
this freaking amazing cll

20:03.463 --> 20:05.116
from my friend, Candiace.
- Okay.

20:05.116 --> 20:08.468
She has an album out.
She is touring the City Winery.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.078
- Nice.
- And she invited me

20:10.078 --> 20:10.992
to come on stage with her
to perform with her.

20:10.992 --> 20:12.863
Whoo!

20:12.863 --> 20:13.647
And I'm like we need
another shot for that.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.605
Okay.

20:15.605 --> 20:18.565
Let's take a shot, real quick.
Hey, to family, baby.

20:18.565 --> 20:22.656
- Family, whoo!
- To family, I love it.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.701
- That's good.
- Damn, family.

20:24.701 --> 20:25.876
This is so wild, guys.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.184
Okay, let me
take you over here.

20:29.184 --> 20:31.447
Hold on. Let me
FaceTime Kandi, real quick.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.057
I'm about to
headbutt this bitch!

20:33.057 --> 20:35.495
To invite her to
our performance.

20:35.495 --> 20:36.887
Mm-hmm. All right.

20:36.887 --> 20:39.020
I'm gonna go talk to the boys
while you do that.

20:39.020 --> 20:39.890
I wanna make sure--
yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.065
Okay.

20:41.065 --> 20:42.893
- Hi, girl.
- Hello, curls.

20:43.851 --> 20:45.156
Hi. I'm good.

20:45.156 --> 20:46.593
How are you?

20:47.724 --> 20:49.726
Okay, first, we're
celebrating family.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.075
Say hi, Courtney.

20:51.075 --> 20:52.555
Hey!

20:52.555 --> 20:55.558
Courtney is
actually Ralph's cousin.

20:58.648 --> 21:01.172
What? I don't ever
wanna be messy.

21:01.172 --> 21:03.523
I'm not trying to
bringing drama with Drew.

21:03.523 --> 21:06.090
I am very taken aback
from Kandi's reaction

21:06.090 --> 21:07.570
towards cousin Courtney,

21:07.570 --> 21:09.485
'cause I'm like,
what did I miss?

21:09.485 --> 21:12.401
This had to be a really big deal
to have this energy still.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.055
So, I don't wanna be
in the middle.

21:14.055 --> 21:15.622
Girl, you know
I don't like this lady.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.406
Like, why are you on
my phone with this?

21:17.406 --> 21:19.190
I wasn't there,
and I don't know

21:19.190 --> 21:20.757
what actually happened.

21:20.757 --> 21:24.935
So, Candiace, she asked me
to perform with her on stage.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.637
Kandi,
this is divine.

21:32.552 --> 21:33.466
Okay.

21:34.858 --> 21:36.512
Bye.

21:36.512 --> 21:37.948
Drew, we got
so much to tell you.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.907
- Girl, apparently.
- You have missed it.

21:39.907 --> 21:42.779
I know what Ralph told me
about y'all having

21:42.779 --> 21:44.825
a little situation,
but I'm like--

21:44.825 --> 21:46.217
Yeah, it was-- it was
a little situation,

21:46.217 --> 21:47.436
but I'm over it.

21:47.436 --> 21:48.698
Like, I haven't
thought about it since.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.700
Nothing is going on.
I promise you.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.136
What?
Okay, let's sit down.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.140
So, can you come on Monday
for the performance?

21:56.140 --> 21:59.100
Yeah, of course,
but not if it's going

21:59.100 --> 22:01.145
to make anyone else
feel insecure.

22:01.145 --> 22:02.973
- No, no, no.
- Honestly, Drew, that night,

22:02.973 --> 22:04.671
so we're having
a conversation,

22:04.671 --> 22:06.586
and Sanya is right there,
and I'm like,

22:06.586 --> 22:09.153
"Even you said at Sheree's house
that I should confront her."

22:09.153 --> 22:11.112
She's like,
"I didn't say that."

22:11.112 --> 22:13.897
I'm gonna say this.
Sanya can be a little tricky.

22:13.897 --> 22:15.377
- Learning.
- Yeah,

22:15.377 --> 22:16.944
learn it through and through
because this girl and I

22:16.944 --> 22:19.512
were building a really
genuine friendship.

22:19.512 --> 22:21.209
- Yeah.
- And all of a sudden,

22:21.209 --> 22:23.211
out of nowhere,
she confronted me

22:23.211 --> 22:24.473
with all of these issues
she had in front of the group.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.170
Oh.

22:26.170 --> 22:28.956
Things with Sanya and I were
moving in a better direction,

22:28.956 --> 22:31.001
and then, all of a sudden,
outta nowhere,

22:31.001 --> 22:33.700
I noticed she unfollowed me,
and I'm like,

22:33.700 --> 22:34.962
well, wait a minute.
That is a big deal.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.006
When you unfollow somebody,

22:36.006 --> 22:37.791
that is making
a major statement.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.227
She'll say
she's my friend,

22:39.227 --> 22:41.751
and then when the rest
of the group gets together,

22:41.751 --> 22:45.015
it changes.
- Interesting.

22:45.015 --> 22:46.234
What, Bryce?

22:46.234 --> 22:47.757
You know how
us women are, right?

22:47.757 --> 22:49.150
Right.

22:49.150 --> 22:50.760
We're gonna do a toast
to this thing, right here.

22:50.760 --> 22:54.024
- To family, friendships.
- To family, to the journey.

22:54.024 --> 22:55.112
Cheers.

22:55.112 --> 22:56.200
Yo, y'all wanna do
some more shots?

22:58.159 --> 22:59.769
Coming up...

22:59.769 --> 23:01.249
You don't talk
behind people back.

23:01.249 --> 23:02.424
Listen, and you say,

23:02.424 --> 23:04.121
"Marlo, long as you're
respectful to me,

23:04.121 --> 23:06.167
"that's all that matters."
- And you were not.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.704
Don't text
and drive, auntie.

23:21.704 --> 23:22.966
Yeah, you're right.
I shouldn't text and drive.

23:22.966 --> 23:25.055
All right, Michael.
Text, um, Mr. Anthony.

23:25.055 --> 23:27.057
Tell him I just want
all three pair of shoes,

23:27.057 --> 23:28.972
and I'm gonna pick up
my Cartier love bracelet,

23:28.972 --> 23:30.060
but I'm not going there

23:30.060 --> 23:31.888
'cause it's pouring
down raining.

23:31.888 --> 23:34.151
- I love the mall.
- I know you love the mall.

23:34.151 --> 23:35.631
Not me.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.111
William, you--

23:40.027 --> 23:42.856
Oh! You better have
straight As.

23:42.856 --> 23:45.859
I had straight As.
Now, I have As and Bs.

23:45.859 --> 23:46.990
Ooh, wait a minute.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.818
Now, straight As
get $1,000 shoes.

23:48.818 --> 23:50.820
Can we lift it back up?
Pick it up.

23:50.820 --> 23:52.605
Now that Michael and William
are here to stay,

23:52.605 --> 23:54.650
I gotta make sure
these boys together,

23:54.650 --> 23:56.391
especially when
it comes to grades.

23:56.391 --> 24:00.743
I'm really protective over them
because this world is so cruel.

24:00.743 --> 24:03.703
A few years ago, I lost
my older nephew, Quentin,

24:03.703 --> 24:05.095
due to gun violence.

24:05.095 --> 24:08.795
That's why I'm so hard on
the boys about school,

24:08.795 --> 24:11.275
manners, knowing how
to handle yourself

24:11.275 --> 24:12.886
because I just
want them to be safe.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.409
Lord knows I do.

24:17.325 --> 24:19.109
Is Miss Sharon
still coming Saturday?

24:19.109 --> 24:21.372
Oh, yeah, she's coming.
Do you like the life coach?

24:23.113 --> 24:24.375
Mm-hmm.

24:24.375 --> 24:25.855
Have you seen
a difference in me?

24:28.162 --> 24:29.206
Yes.

24:29.206 --> 24:32.166
I could see
you're trying.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.647
You are the best.
Let me let the trunk open.

24:34.647 --> 24:36.039
There you go.
I know it's wet.

24:36.039 --> 24:37.476
Thank you, baby.
- Love you.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.128
- I'll see you when I get back.
- We'll talk soon.

24:38.128 --> 24:39.695
All right. Bye.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.305
I think you
should let me drive.

24:41.305 --> 24:42.219

- How are you?

25:35.011 --> 25:37.405
I am nervous,
I am here.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.015
I love the song, Candiace.

25:39.015 --> 25:42.802
- Did you-- yes.
- I-I was almost in tears.

25:42.802 --> 25:45.065
Candiace's song
resonated with me

25:45.065 --> 25:46.893
because it's about
believing in yourself,

25:46.893 --> 25:48.851
and that's just exactly
where I am.

25:48.851 --> 25:50.940
People haven't always been
the most supportive of my music

25:50.940 --> 25:52.986
because they only
see me as an actress,

25:52.986 --> 25:56.337
but nothing is going to stop me
from achieving my dreams.

25:56.337 --> 25:59.209
Okay, so, Candiace
will introduce Drew.

25:59.209 --> 26:01.124
- Mm-hmm.
- She'll bring Drew
out on stage.

26:01.124 --> 26:02.386
How are you feeling?

26:02.386 --> 26:04.214
- Nervous as hell.
- Oh my god, whatever!

26:37.900 --> 26:39.989
- What's up?
- How you doin'?

26:39.989 --> 26:42.775
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you. Muah.

26:45.255 --> 26:48.258
- Hi. Oh, you look so pretty.
- Thank you.

26:48.258 --> 26:52.393
- This is so cute.
- Girl, thank you.

26:52.393 --> 26:54.090
- Hi.
- Hello, hello.

26:54.090 --> 26:56.440
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.964
It is really frustrating

26:57.964 --> 26:59.922
trying to build
a friendship with Drew,

26:59.922 --> 27:02.577
but I really wanna move on
and start over,

27:02.577 --> 27:04.535
so I genuinely
wanna be here tonight,

27:04.535 --> 27:06.581
and I'm hoping that
there will be good energy

27:06.581 --> 27:07.800
and good vibes.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.237
All right, concert vibes.

27:11.499 --> 27:12.979
Thank you so much, Atlanta.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.163
I feel Kandi still
hasn't forgiven me

27:23.163 --> 27:25.992
since the reunion,
and I'm okay with that

27:25.992 --> 27:28.081
because I know, with Kandi,
it takes times.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.604
I mean, if I was a man,
it probably wouldn't take

27:29.604 --> 27:32.433
as much time,
or if I was a chicken wing,

27:32.433 --> 27:34.609
it wouldn't
take as much time, either.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.089
I'm gonna run to the restroom,
real quick.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.047
Okay.
So, wait a minute.

27:38.047 --> 27:40.006
Where-- so, where are we at
with Marlo?

27:40.006 --> 27:41.137
Ain't nobody
speaking to Marlo?

27:41.137 --> 27:43.879
I know you--
- I did this kinda smile.

27:43.879 --> 27:46.142
I'm just keeping
my distance, chile.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.622
What was--
what was the issue?

27:47.622 --> 27:50.538
- When we were in Jamaica--
- She tried to play me.

27:50.538 --> 27:53.193
Monyetta came,
with Kandi's permission, okay.

27:53.193 --> 27:55.195
It's nice out here.

27:55.195 --> 27:57.545
I can't talk sh-- about somebody
and then smile in their face.

27:57.545 --> 27:59.373
Like, I'm not
a fake bitch like that.

27:59.373 --> 28:02.289
- Okay, understood.
- Hey!

28:02.289 --> 28:03.507
Hey, I'm gonna claim you.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.118
I'm trying to figure out
who claimed you.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.859
I'm gonna claim you.
- Yes.

28:06.859 --> 28:08.643
How are you?
Hi, ladies.

28:08.643 --> 28:11.907
- Hello. How are you?
- I'm good.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.430
Courtney and I don't need to
talk about anything.

28:13.430 --> 28:14.997
I'm not looking
for new friends.

28:14.997 --> 28:16.477
She can keep it pushin'.

28:16.477 --> 28:17.913
I'm so glad
when I saw you.

28:17.913 --> 28:19.349
I'm like, where the hell
is Sheree and Courtney?

28:19.349 --> 28:20.655
Oh, my God, yes.
Where is Sheree? Yes.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.309
So, wait.
What's the verdict on Sheree?

28:22.309 --> 28:24.703
- Yeah, she's not feeling well.
- Oh.

28:27.531 --> 28:30.012
I'm sorry to miss
an opportunity to see our girl

28:30.012 --> 28:33.015
flop it like Drew,
but I'm under the weather.

28:36.192 --> 28:37.541
- What's up, Ralph?
- How you doin'?

28:37.541 --> 28:39.369
Are you ready for D-Drew
to do her thing?

28:39.369 --> 28:40.283
Of course.

28:40.283 --> 28:42.198
Let's kill it.
Let's do it.

28:42.198 --> 28:44.331
Amen.

29:38.994 --> 29:42.128
It has been so long
since I've been on stage

29:42.128 --> 29:45.174
because I have been focusing on
being a mother of three,

to make music my career,

29:48.221 --> 29:50.397

Yes.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.618
More! More!

31:21.618 --> 31:24.099
Thank you, love.

31:24.099 --> 31:26.145
This moment
is giving me life.

31:26.145 --> 31:27.624
Like, I could sing all night.

31:27.624 --> 31:31.367
I am ready for a tour.
Sign me up.

31:31.367 --> 31:34.588
What's going on here?
This is not a performance.

31:34.588 --> 31:37.199
I would have not invited
all these people here

31:37.199 --> 31:38.418
to come see me

31:38.418 --> 31:40.768
and that be the only thing
I'm doing.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.944
I wanted more than
a whoo, whoo, whoo.

31:42.944 --> 31:45.729
Whoo, whoo.
Whoo, whoo.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.383
I'm not quite sure
what that was,

31:47.383 --> 31:48.863
but what I do know is,

31:48.863 --> 31:51.779
I ran longer to clinch
my 400-meter gold medal

31:51.779 --> 31:53.607
than Drew
was just on stage.

31:56.697 --> 31:57.916
Yes.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.439
Give it up for
Miss Drew Sidora, y'all.

32:01.615 --> 32:04.487
Kandi, Kandi, she's gonna
sing some more...

32:04.487 --> 32:05.619
What's next?

32:05.619 --> 32:07.882
No.

32:07.882 --> 32:12.843
♪ I'm not used to
dealing with a bitch ♪

32:12.843 --> 32:14.454
I'm coming down
from a high, baby.

32:14.454 --> 32:16.282
Let's go.

32:16.282 --> 32:19.241
I wanted to give you
your flowers.

32:19.241 --> 32:22.810
- You are so sweet.
- You're so amazing, baby.

32:22.810 --> 32:25.160
But how did it feel?
- It felt so good.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.683
I feel like I can do it.

32:26.683 --> 32:28.294
Now, you can have
your own moment.

32:28.294 --> 32:29.817
I'm ready.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.123
I'm just happy to just be able
to support it and see it.

32:31.123 --> 32:32.211
You know what I'm saying?
- Yo, I know, right?

32:32.211 --> 32:33.647
Like, this is different.
- That's it.

32:33.647 --> 32:36.432
It means everything to me
to have Ralph's support.

32:36.432 --> 32:38.869
And after today,
I'm ready.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.393
Kandi is not gonna be
the only one

32:40.393 --> 32:43.352
with a Grammy much longer.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.659
All right, let's go.
- Drew Sidora is back, baby.

32:45.659 --> 32:48.009
Let's go.

32:48.009 --> 32:51.273
What's up?
You did so good!

32:51.273 --> 32:52.448
- Did I?
- Yes, you did.

32:52.448 --> 32:54.276
Girl, I was so nervous.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.191
You did--
you sang so good, baby.

32:56.191 --> 32:58.454
Thank you for coming.

32:58.454 --> 33:01.849
Girl, I needed you
to perform your song.

33:01.849 --> 33:05.418
♪ I think you're insecure

33:13.339 --> 33:16.690
Thank you so much
for coming out.

33:21.390 --> 33:22.391
Thank you.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.350
We love y'all.

33:25.655 --> 33:26.961
Give her her roses.

33:26.961 --> 33:28.571
We'll be back here
in the room.

33:34.403 --> 33:36.014
Hi.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.538
- This whole space is ours?
- This is us, honey.

33:38.538 --> 33:40.409
- Yes.
- Turn up. Turn up.

33:40.409 --> 33:43.369
Oh, my God, it's over.
Thank you, God.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.806
I thought you was
coming out naked.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.590
Not naked, honey.

33:47.590 --> 33:50.898
So, explain why you just had,
like, a small

33:50.898 --> 33:52.378
whoo, whoo, whoo moment.

33:52.378 --> 33:53.901
'Cause it's her set,
so it was like

33:53.901 --> 33:55.946
I came to support my friend.

33:55.946 --> 33:56.860
We're proud of you, Drew.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.558
We wanna see more,
for sure.

33:58.558 --> 34:00.864
Sanya was giving you
a-a standing ovation.

34:00.864 --> 34:02.257
Shut up.

34:02.257 --> 34:03.737
I thought
the performance was incredible.

34:03.737 --> 34:05.086
I thought you did
a great job.

34:05.086 --> 34:06.392
Like the rest of them,
I thought she was gonna

34:06.392 --> 34:07.654
sing a little longer.

34:07.654 --> 34:09.438
But, Drew,
I just need to understand this,

34:09.438 --> 34:11.919
what happened on the stage
at Bravo Con

34:11.919 --> 34:14.269
because I genuinely thought
we were trying to move forward.

34:14.269 --> 34:15.792
You had sent me a text.

34:15.792 --> 34:17.751
You wanted me to come to
your mom's birthday.

34:17.751 --> 34:19.753
You wanted to extend
an olive branch,

34:19.753 --> 34:21.450
and then I feel like
you get into, like,

34:21.450 --> 34:23.409
Drew the actress mode,
and you just have to, like,

34:23.409 --> 34:24.758
turn up in that moment
and, like,

34:24.758 --> 34:27.674
make it an issue, again.
- I will say this.

34:27.674 --> 34:31.025
I thought we were on a path
of moving forward.

34:31.025 --> 34:32.592
I guess
when I dropped the merch,

34:32.592 --> 34:34.898
which I thought was funny,
you unfollowed me.

34:34.898 --> 34:36.944
It really wasn't
any smoke.

34:36.944 --> 34:38.424
That was because of
the hair flip.

34:38.424 --> 34:40.948
No, baby,
it was the hair flip.

34:40.948 --> 34:42.776
Drew, do not do that.

34:42.776 --> 34:44.430
She's flipping her hair
in my face, Andy.

34:44.430 --> 34:45.648
I don't wanna go down
my timeline

34:45.648 --> 34:46.997
and see stuff that
I feel is disrespectful.

34:46.997 --> 34:48.651
I honestly didn't see the merch
until way after.

34:48.651 --> 34:50.000
Somebody sent it to me.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.393
We're gonna stop
the flip flopping

34:51.393 --> 34:52.742
'cause I don't flip flop.

34:52.742 --> 34:53.482
But I will say this
because I don't want to

34:53.482 --> 34:55.005
go back into the past.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.137
Like, I really, really don't.
- Right. Yeah, me either.

34:56.137 --> 34:56.920
You coming here
was an olive branch.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.401
- Yeah.
- That means so much.

34:59.401 --> 35:02.926
Squash that beef!
Squash that beef!

35:02.926 --> 35:04.972
Did we squash it?

35:04.972 --> 35:07.931
Maybe we can do, like,
a lunch or something,

35:07.931 --> 35:10.934
and we're gonna get this train
back on the track.

35:10.934 --> 35:13.023
Get this train
back on the track.

35:13.023 --> 35:15.330
I'm gonna stand up for that.

35:15.330 --> 35:16.984
This is classy.
We gotta keep it classy.

35:16.984 --> 35:18.028
I love that.

35:18.028 --> 35:19.421
One-on-one.
Drew and Sanya,

35:19.421 --> 35:21.641
they have, like,
this love-hate relationship,

35:21.641 --> 35:24.470
but, hopefully,
they can mend their differences.

35:24.470 --> 35:26.689
It's really draining
watching those two.

35:26.689 --> 35:29.649
Y'all take that mess
and go somewhere with it

35:29.649 --> 35:31.477
and never come back
with it, okay?

35:31.477 --> 35:32.913
I'm glad this is
a place of healing.

35:32.913 --> 35:33.870
Yes.

35:33.870 --> 35:35.655
Talk your
problems through.

35:35.655 --> 35:36.873
So, everybody is good.
What did I miss?

35:36.873 --> 35:39.572
What's been going on?

35:39.572 --> 35:41.487
Well, you know,
I heard that Courtney,

35:41.487 --> 35:45.360
apparently, you had some things
to say about me to Sanya.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.493
You said that she went to
some event,

35:47.493 --> 35:50.017
and she brought the ghetto out
or the hood out.

35:50.017 --> 35:53.455
The crowd, ghetto.

35:53.455 --> 35:54.891
Courtney said it was
an exclusive spot,

35:54.891 --> 35:56.371
and you posted it,

35:56.371 --> 35:57.633
and you brought
the ratchet people,

35:57.633 --> 35:59.374
and you brought the hood out.

35:59.374 --> 36:00.680
- Yeah.
- What?

36:00.680 --> 36:01.376
First off,
I was born in the hood.

36:02.551 --> 36:03.900
So, then why would
you say that then?

36:03.900 --> 36:05.424
That's not what I said.

36:05.424 --> 36:06.947
I said ghetto people
started to come,

36:06.947 --> 36:08.253
which was true,

36:08.253 --> 36:11.647
and I also doubled down
that I like ghetto,

36:11.647 --> 36:12.735
and I love it.

36:12.735 --> 36:14.868
My family is hood.
I can show you.

36:14.868 --> 36:16.130
Can I just say
something?

36:16.130 --> 36:18.001
It just comes across aggressive.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.047
Well, I'm just saying
I said it.

36:20.047 --> 36:22.484
It's just like, it's just
lighting a match again.

36:22.484 --> 36:25.487
That's what I feel like,
the way that you're rah-rahing.

36:25.487 --> 36:27.185
First of all,
let's be clear.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.057
If people started to come,
whoever's event it was

36:30.057 --> 36:31.406
should have been glad--
- Oh, really?

36:31.406 --> 36:32.842
To have people
that support them.

36:32.842 --> 36:34.540
I have a long range
of friends,

36:34.540 --> 36:36.629
long range.
- And, uh, great. Great.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.021
That's not the point.
- You should never say things

36:38.021 --> 36:39.980
that look down on the places
where you come from.

36:39.980 --> 36:41.155
- You are really triggered.
- That--

36:41.155 --> 36:43.679
You are
really triggered.

36:43.679 --> 36:46.769
The thing that triggers me
is that you don't know me,

36:46.769 --> 36:48.728
and that you're saying--
- I-- and I definite--

36:48.728 --> 36:50.643
- "Oh, she bring the hood out."
- and I promise

36:50.643 --> 36:51.513
I'm okay not knowing you!
- Bottom line,

36:51.513 --> 36:52.819
I bring everybody out!

37:00.130 --> 37:01.871
You're saying,
"Oh, she bring the hood out."

37:01.871 --> 37:03.786
I promise I'm okay
not knowing you!

37:03.786 --> 37:04.918
Bottom line,
I bring everybody out!

37:04.918 --> 37:06.659
- Great!
- Not "I bring the hood out."

37:06.659 --> 37:08.617
Well, you are the ghetto.
- Really?

37:08.617 --> 37:09.879
You just told us.

37:09.879 --> 37:11.620
Yeah, I don't think the hood
or the ghetto

37:11.620 --> 37:13.274
appreciate
what you had to say.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.449
- Bro, bro, bro.
- What's up?

37:14.449 --> 37:15.972
Do you have, like,
an area on the bus

37:15.972 --> 37:17.147
that y'all can go
and, like, get it in

37:17.147 --> 37:18.148
or somethin' like that?

37:18.148 --> 37:18.975
Like, you pull
a curtain back?

37:18.975 --> 37:20.499
You gotta
bless the bus,

37:20.499 --> 37:22.196
the 1,000-mile.
- The 1,000-mile club.

37:22.196 --> 37:24.807
It's kinda tough

37:24.807 --> 37:26.287
with ten mother----ers
on the bus.

37:26.287 --> 37:27.636
I'll be honest.

37:27.636 --> 37:28.811
So, wait.
In the spirit

37:28.811 --> 37:30.683
of talking out stuff, Monyetta,

37:30.683 --> 37:32.032
I had asked you at the table--
- Yes.

37:32.032 --> 37:33.773
What was the issue you had
with Marlo, right?

37:33.773 --> 37:35.253
- Yes.
- And you said that

37:35.253 --> 37:36.645
you felt like last year
she was trying to play you.

37:36.645 --> 37:37.994
She definitely
tried to play me.

37:37.994 --> 37:39.866
"Oh, I guess Kandi
let her come talk."

37:39.866 --> 37:40.910
And I was really trying
to see what was going on.

37:40.910 --> 37:42.521
When did I say that?

37:42.521 --> 37:43.870
- You said that in Jamaica.
- Thank you.

37:43.870 --> 37:45.263
You don't talk
behind people's back.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.699
Listen, you said
I have nothing to do

37:46.699 --> 37:48.178
with you
and Kandi's issues.

37:48.178 --> 37:49.441
- I don't have anything.
- I like you, and I love--

37:49.441 --> 37:50.964
- I speak for myself.
- My sister, Kandi.

37:50.964 --> 37:52.008
- Exactly. Thank you.
- You definitely--

37:52.008 --> 37:53.488
- Let's be clear--
- And you said--

37:53.488 --> 37:54.707
- I have no problem with that.
- "Marlo, long as you're

37:54.707 --> 37:56.099
respectful to me,
that's all that matters."

37:56.099 --> 37:58.145
Exactly, and you were not.
It's about kindness.

37:58.145 --> 38:00.800
So, is hat all you had
to say to me, beautiful?

38:00.800 --> 38:02.845
- Girl, bye.
- Oh!

38:02.845 --> 38:05.326
Okay, um, Kandi,
what's going on with Blaze,

38:05.326 --> 38:08.808
because we were at Blaze
two days before...

38:08.808 --> 38:11.245
Before what happened?

38:11.245 --> 38:13.291
Um, there was,
like, an incident.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.379
- What incident?
- It was, like,

38:14.379 --> 38:15.771
all over the news.
- They're fine.

38:15.771 --> 38:16.903
You're talking about
the shooting

38:16.903 --> 38:17.860
that happened at Blaze?

38:17.860 --> 38:19.862
It was
a private matter.

38:22.212 --> 38:24.040
Okay, I'm ready
to go home, you guys.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.477
- No.
- 'Cause, as I say,

38:25.477 --> 38:27.348
Kandi Burruss never can
talk about what she wants.

38:27.348 --> 38:28.958
- Oh, really? Okay, well--
- So, I'll stop talking myself.

38:28.958 --> 38:30.569
Let's talk about when you
cut the girl in the face then.

38:30.569 --> 38:33.049
Okay, let's talk about that.
Sh-- was over 23 years ago.

38:33.049 --> 38:36.836
Everyone loves to bring up
things with my past,

38:36.836 --> 38:40.100
my mugshots, allegedly
me dating old White men,

38:40.100 --> 38:42.232
my mom, the boys,

38:42.232 --> 38:45.105
but when it comes to Kandi,
they get that broom,

38:45.105 --> 38:46.846
the little Swiffer,
and they just sweep it

38:46.846 --> 38:49.239
right up
underneath the rug.

38:49.239 --> 38:51.938
I gave you a lot of attention,
uh, enough.

38:51.938 --> 38:54.636
This is a night of music,
a night of love.

38:54.636 --> 38:56.595
Drew, you were
amazing tonight!

38:56.595 --> 38:58.901
- Let's go downstairs.
- Oh, my god, good job, girl!

38:58.901 --> 39:01.643
- Hey, who's that?
- Hey, girl empowerment!

39:05.386 --> 39:07.693
This has been
a night, honey.

39:07.693 --> 39:09.303
Love y'all.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.830
I reached out to Kandi.

39:14.830 --> 39:17.093
I was there two days
before the shooting.

39:17.093 --> 39:18.921
So, I was
concerned, truly,

39:18.921 --> 39:20.270
because I had
30 of my family--

39:20.270 --> 39:21.924
But why didn't you say,
"shooting," though?

39:21.924 --> 39:24.144
- Time out. I was there.
- No. Time in.

39:24.144 --> 39:26.407
Why didn't you say,
"shooting?"

39:26.407 --> 39:27.626
- Everybody knows.
- 'Cause Sanya didn't know.

39:27.626 --> 39:29.192
- It was on the news.
- We are a family.

39:29.192 --> 39:30.411
It was on the news.

39:30.411 --> 39:31.760
I'm gonna ask you
a question, though.

39:31.760 --> 39:32.979
I need you
to understand this.

39:32.979 --> 39:33.980
I'll let you talk.

39:33.980 --> 39:35.373
I don't need
to say somethin',

39:35.373 --> 39:36.504
if you're gonna say it.
- Courtney, you're here

39:36.504 --> 39:37.636
to witness this.
- I'm not you, bitch.

39:37.636 --> 39:38.854
- She's talking. I'm quie.
- I am an individual.

39:38.854 --> 39:40.378
And Drew and, uh, Ralph,
you listen, too.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.380
Listen while I'm quiet.
Now, talk.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.555
Somebody
getting shot at--

39:43.555 --> 39:45.339
no disrespect
to any of your family--

39:45.339 --> 39:47.210
I've had--
I've lost a lot of family.

39:47.210 --> 39:48.734
I am from Chicago.

39:48.734 --> 39:50.866
And you, out of all people,
if you experienced it,

39:50.866 --> 39:52.651
why would I make
a moment about that?

39:54.304 --> 39:56.698
Drew is trying to act like
she lost people to gun violence,

39:56.698 --> 39:58.134
and she can't say
the word, "shooting."

39:58.134 --> 40:00.136
Um, there was,
like, an incident.

40:00.136 --> 40:01.834
It was, like, all over the news.
- What incident?

40:01.834 --> 40:04.837
But I lost someone who was
close to me, as well,

40:04.837 --> 40:08.057
and it's triggering
for me.

40:08.057 --> 40:10.146
The silence isn't real?

40:10.146 --> 40:11.409
So, I'm gonna get my roses
and I'm gonna--

40:14.499 --> 40:15.717
I said what I needed to say.

40:15.717 --> 40:17.415
Okay, so now can you
respect me enough to

40:17.415 --> 40:18.285
see what I have to say?
- What do you possibly
have to say?

40:29.862 --> 40:31.864
When Drew brought up
the shooting,

40:31.864 --> 40:33.735
I just thought of Quentin
in his chef outfit,

40:33.735 --> 40:36.346
lookin' so proud,
because two years ago,

40:36.346 --> 40:38.261
when I text Kandi
to tell her

40:38.261 --> 40:40.002
that my nephew,
who worked for you,

40:40.002 --> 40:42.440
he got shot at home
by his roommate,

40:42.440 --> 40:43.876
I just felt she didn't care.

40:43.876 --> 40:46.487
Then when I see her
the next day,

40:46.487 --> 40:48.794
she pretended like
she had no idea

40:48.794 --> 40:50.143
what I was talking about.

40:50.143 --> 40:52.275
When we left, um,
the other night

40:52.275 --> 40:54.190
- Uh-huh.
- From [indistinct] party--

40:54.190 --> 40:55.191
- Mm-hmm.
- My phone was

40:55.191 --> 40:56.932
blowing up, Kandi.
- For what?

40:56.932 --> 40:59.195
Like, my sister.
She's like, "Call me.

40:59.195 --> 41:01.067
They just killed my baby,
your nephew."

41:01.067 --> 41:04.026
I'm like-- my nephew was 30,
and he lived here in Atlanta,

41:04.026 --> 41:06.333
and just him and a guy,
a roommate,

41:06.333 --> 41:09.118
got into it,
and he murdered him.

41:09.118 --> 41:11.730
- Damn.
- Isn't that sad?

41:11.730 --> 41:13.514
Nobody can make Kandi
talk about anything

41:13.514 --> 41:14.776
she don't want to, chile,

41:14.776 --> 41:17.170
and people allowed her
to get away with it.

41:17.170 --> 41:19.868
But guess what.
I'm calling you out.

41:19.868 --> 41:25.308
Because--

41:25.308 --> 41:27.223
We're not doing that.

41:27.223 --> 41:29.051
- My nephew is dead.
- I'm not acting, but I--

41:29.051 --> 41:30.792
- My blood nephew is dead.
- And I said to you

41:30.792 --> 41:33.142
when I left-- feel--
- My blood nephew is dead,

41:33.142 --> 41:34.100
- But feel-- but if--
- And you're talking

41:34.100 --> 41:35.362
- But feel--
- About acting.

41:35.362 --> 41:36.537
No, you're acting, though.
- But feel my--

41:36.537 --> 41:39.148
you!
My nephew is dead, bitch!

41:39.148 --> 41:40.976
Girl-- you know what?

41:40.976 --> 41:45.546
I'm telling you my nephew
is dead, are you serious!?!

41:45.546 --> 41:48.244
you bitch!
Know when to cut off the acting.

41:51.117 --> 41:52.466
This bitch is acting.

41:56.078 --> 41:58.559
Next time, on
"The Real Housewives
of Atlanta"...

41:58.559 --> 42:00.909
Ooh, Lord.

42:00.909 --> 42:02.171
What?

42:02.171 --> 42:03.825
You been trying?

42:03.825 --> 42:06.175
Trying for what?

42:06.175 --> 42:08.874
Ross, he's ready for us
to just be us, again.

42:08.874 --> 42:09.788
Good for y'all.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.839
I will be performing
in the halftime show

42:17.839 --> 42:20.842
at the Magic City Classic
Football Game.

42:20.842 --> 42:22.844
Do I wanna bring these
heifers down there?

42:22.844 --> 42:25.934
We are going to
a dance class.

42:25.934 --> 42:29.372
And then we'll get ready to go
to the little Charity function.

42:33.072 --> 42:35.074
We're going to
a nice charity event.

42:35.074 --> 42:36.249
We're not going
to a strip club.

42:36.249 --> 42:38.207
Wherever you wanna sit.

42:42.298 --> 42:44.474
Wow. We can't stay.
We gotta go.

42:44.474 --> 42:45.606
It just feels like
something is happening,

42:45.606 --> 42:47.260
and we're being left out.

42:47.260 --> 42:50.002
Summer is over, bitch.
Winter is coming.

42:50.002 --> 42:51.569
Summer!

42:51.569 --> 42:52.831
Who the
is banging

42:52.831 --> 42:54.833
on my goddamn door?
- Summer!

42:54.833 --> 42:56.486
What the
is wrong with you?

42:56.486 --> 42:58.227
- Summer! Summer!
- My child is here!
