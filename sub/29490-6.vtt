01:38.446 --> 01:41.057
Daryl: Hi.

01:42.276 --> 01:43.625
Hey.

01:43.668 --> 01:45.627
Feelin' better?

01:45.670 --> 01:47.237
Yeah. Thanks.

01:47.281 --> 01:48.369
Where you goin'?

01:48.412 --> 01:50.675
Mm, gonna do another sweep
for Negan.

01:50.719 --> 01:52.677
Cool.
You want company?

02:00.250 --> 02:03.123
Think Negan
crossed the border?

02:03.166 --> 02:06.213
He'd know we couldn't
follow him over there.

02:06.256 --> 02:09.129
I can't see him
puttin' on a mask.

02:09.172 --> 02:11.696
Or staying quiet
for long.

02:11.740 --> 02:14.351
Still, stranger things
have happened.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.270
We takin' a break?

02:20.314 --> 02:21.793
Nope.

02:21.837 --> 02:24.318
This is
our spot today.

02:24.361 --> 02:27.059
Gonna stay here...

02:27.103 --> 02:30.062
see what we see.

02:30.106 --> 02:31.325
He ain't
gonna wander around,

02:31.368 --> 02:33.327
waitin' to get spotted.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.633
He ain't that dumb.

02:35.677 --> 02:37.635
Neither are you.

02:37.679 --> 02:40.421
Gee, thanks.

02:44.686 --> 02:48.124
You wanna tell me
what we're doin' out here?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.647
Lookin' for Negan.

02:49.691 --> 02:51.649
Right.

02:51.693 --> 02:54.391
You gonna tell me
what we're really lookin' for?

03:00.049 --> 03:03.444
Alpha's horde.

03:05.228 --> 03:08.100
We're gonna find it,
and we're gonna destroy it.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.063
Come on.
Admit it.

03:58.107 --> 04:00.979
There's a tiny part of you
that's thrilled to be sick.

04:03.025 --> 04:05.419
Just so you
can spend more time with me.

04:05.462 --> 04:06.942
You think I'm pukin'

04:06.985 --> 04:08.857
because I got
a little crush?

04:08.900 --> 04:11.947
Textbook case
of butterflies in the stomach.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.036
I want
a second opinion.

04:14.079 --> 04:17.648
Oh, it's simple science,
darlin'.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.433
Bodies
manifest emotion

04:19.476 --> 04:22.610
in all sorts
of different ways.

04:22.653 --> 04:26.570
The heart wants
what it wants.

04:26.614 --> 04:29.443
Right?
Inhale for me.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.488
Good.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.664
And exhale.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.623
Alright.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.799
Seriously, though,

04:37.842 --> 04:41.585
don't you think we'd make
a bitchin' couple?

04:41.629 --> 04:44.545
Son, I would break you
like a twig.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.286
Siddiq: How's he doin',
Cheryl?

04:46.329 --> 04:48.026
Jury's still out.

04:48.070 --> 04:50.072
Ouch.

04:50.115 --> 04:52.727
I thought we were havin'
a moment here, Cheryl.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.773
Is she okay?
Everything alright?

04:55.817 --> 04:56.905
Yeah.

04:56.948 --> 04:59.342
Couple more cases
of that stomach bug.

05:00.778 --> 05:04.216
So that
makes it seven.
Yeah.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.218
You know,
maybe I should just

05:06.262 --> 05:07.524
put Coco down
for a minute --

05:07.568 --> 05:08.220
Don't worry about it,
man.

05:08.264 --> 05:09.570
I got it.
Sure?

05:09.613 --> 05:11.659
Yeah.
How's Rosita?

05:11.702 --> 05:14.792
Ah, same as everybody else,
it seems.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.925
The most we can do
is keep 'em hydrated

05:16.968 --> 05:18.709
and wait it out.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.102
Mm-hmm.

05:20.145 --> 05:23.714
Hey, lap up the daddy/daughter
shit while you can,

05:23.758 --> 05:26.500
because they grow
so damn fast.

05:29.154 --> 05:33.637
Okay, a-alright, easy.
Dude, easy.

05:33.681 --> 05:36.292
Have some boundaries.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.641
Okay.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.077
My bad.

05:39.121 --> 05:41.297
You two should go out,
have some fun.

05:42.907 --> 05:44.300
Alright, thanks.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.084
And if you need me
to peek at Rosita later,

05:46.128 --> 05:47.695
just say the word.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.392
Happy to,
you know,

05:49.436 --> 05:51.742
make sure
she's on the mend.

05:55.224 --> 05:58.358
That's one of
those boundaries again.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.185
Yep.

06:00.229 --> 06:01.665
Yeah.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.101
Noted.

06:03.145 --> 06:04.799
Carol: Alpha's been sending
waves of walkers

06:04.842 --> 06:06.409
to screw with us,
right?

06:06.453 --> 06:10.152
Well, I've been tracking walker
movement along the border.

06:10.195 --> 06:11.458
Small groups.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.111
Some of them might have
Whisperers in them.

06:13.155 --> 06:16.724
But they all connect right back
to this general area,

06:16.767 --> 06:19.291
so I figure
we stake out this spot.

06:19.335 --> 06:21.337
See where
the Whisperers go.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.121
Might lead us
back to the horde.

06:23.165 --> 06:24.209
That's smart.

06:24.253 --> 06:26.342
I thought so.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.692
She's gonna need a place,
though,

06:28.736 --> 06:31.478
like the canyon
they used to be in.

06:31.521 --> 06:34.611
Only spots I know are on
Whisperer territory, though.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.874
Not gonna be able
to sneak in there

06:36.918 --> 06:38.876
without startin' up
some kind of shit.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.488
We only need to figure out
where they are,

06:41.531 --> 06:43.664
and then we'll tell the council.
I swear.

06:45.753 --> 06:49.147
Why weren't you
straight with me before?

06:49.452 --> 06:52.150
After what happened
at the border and with Alpha,

06:52.194 --> 06:54.718
I didn't want you
to worry.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.328
Sorry.

06:57.373 --> 06:58.330
I get it.

06:58.374 --> 07:01.159
Just wanna
keep us safe.

07:03.292 --> 07:04.815
So,
you gonna stick around?

07:04.859 --> 07:06.469
Well, if you
spot somethin',

07:06.513 --> 07:09.733
you're gonna need me
to track it, right?

07:09.777 --> 07:11.126
I dunno.

07:11.169 --> 07:14.521
Picked up a few things
over the years.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.481
Yeah,
we'll see.

07:19.308 --> 07:23.138
Honestly,
fellas -- or ladies.

07:23.181 --> 07:25.967
Kinda hard to tell
underneath the outfits.

07:26.010 --> 07:27.664
I wanna join,
alright?

07:27.708 --> 07:28.970
I am a joiner.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.233
Get me
a damn application already.

07:31.276 --> 07:33.888
I mean,
look at you guys, right?

07:33.931 --> 07:35.193
Cool-ass outfits,

07:35.237 --> 07:37.152
the whole
back-to-nature paleo vibe?

07:37.195 --> 07:39.328
You are
a survivalist's wet dream.

07:39.371 --> 07:42.331
Not to mention
the number-one selling point --

07:42.374 --> 07:44.942
no more
bein' eaten by the dead.

07:44.986 --> 07:48.206
But just, out of curiosity,
'cause it's killin' me,

07:48.250 --> 07:49.991
what do you got
goin' on down low?

07:50.034 --> 07:51.514
Are you flyin' around
commando-style,

07:51.558 --> 07:52.646
or do you got, like,

07:52.689 --> 07:55.692
walker long johns
with the la-- flap?

07:55.736 --> 07:58.608
Whoa.

07:58.652 --> 08:01.219
Cool your tits there,
Jolly Green Giant.

08:01.263 --> 08:03.047
Noise.

08:03.091 --> 08:05.354
Constant noise.

08:05.397 --> 08:08.879
I should just
slit your throat,

08:08.923 --> 08:10.620
be done with it.

08:10.664 --> 08:13.014
Okay.
You know what?

08:13.057 --> 08:15.538
You're right, big man.
I am sorry.

08:15.582 --> 08:19.586
I never
properly introduced myself.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.762
Hey, I'm Negan.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.201
For the last
eight years,

08:26.244 --> 08:30.335
I have been locked up
by your enemy.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.120
So you take me
to your leader,

08:32.163 --> 08:36.864
and I will spill
every Goddamn secret I know.

09:04.413 --> 09:06.023
Eugene?

09:06.067 --> 09:07.590
I got
the supplies ya asked for.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.374
Well, feel free
to deposit those

09:09.418 --> 09:12.334
in any location
of your choosin'.

09:16.599 --> 09:19.428
Gotta say, your assist
on the radio relaunch

09:19.471 --> 09:21.299
has been a boon,
and I thank you mightily.

09:21.343 --> 09:24.520
Well, I'm happy to be a part
of the Hilltop AV club.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.436
Care to take the new setup
for a spin?

09:27.479 --> 09:30.004
Some primo
choice upgrades.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.658
Transmitter's been
properly souped up

09:31.701 --> 09:36.271
with Soviet satellite guts,
and...

09:36.314 --> 09:37.359
You don't
parlez-vousRussian,

09:37.402 --> 09:38.665
by any chance?

09:38.708 --> 09:39.927
Nyet.

09:39.970 --> 09:41.624
Well,
that's all I got.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.147
Hmm. Solid.

09:43.191 --> 09:45.672
Well,
just checkin'.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.238
Relocatin' the antenna
to the apex

09:47.282 --> 09:50.285
provides unobstructed L-O-S
to the secondary repeater,

09:50.328 --> 09:52.809
exponentially expanding
our range.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.289
You haven't lived

09:54.332 --> 09:57.335
till you've bounced a
transmission off the ionosphere.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.642
Gives me gooseflesh
each and every time.

09:59.686 --> 10:02.427
Well, this sounds really cool,
Eugene,

10:02.471 --> 10:04.952
but I gotta get back
to the kids.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.997
Oh, yeah.
Understandable.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.651
Bambinos,
they take precedent.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.219
No expiration
on that invite, though.

10:11.262 --> 10:13.221
Cool. Thanks.

10:13.264 --> 10:16.224
Have fun.

10:25.059 --> 10:27.452
Solo trip it is.

10:27.496 --> 10:30.281
Let's see how far you can fly,
little lady.

10:37.288 --> 10:39.247
Rosita:
Calling for Hilltop.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.901
Come in, Hilltop.

10:43.164 --> 10:45.470
Hilltop.
Calling Hilltop.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.951
Copy that,
Alexandria.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.474
This is Hilltop.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.128
Eugene?

10:51.172 --> 10:52.608
Um, yes.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.045
Were you lookin' for someone
in particular?

10:55.089 --> 10:56.699
No, dumbass.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.135
I'm looking for you.

10:58.179 --> 10:59.833
Oh.

10:59.876 --> 11:02.662
Okeydokey.

11:04.185 --> 11:06.361
Just wanted to see
what you were up to.

11:06.404 --> 11:07.710
I figured I'd call.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.321
But I'm also running
a 102-degree fever,

11:10.365 --> 11:12.367
so I could
just be delirious.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.325
What sort of ailments
are we wrestlin' with?

11:14.369 --> 11:16.937
Just a bug.
I'll be fine.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.460
And Coco's okay.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.984
What about you?
What are you up to?

11:22.856 --> 11:25.467
Oh, just some garden-variety
engineerin' advice,

11:25.510 --> 11:27.512
structural
stability checks,

11:27.556 --> 11:30.341
a total revamp
of their radio setup.

11:30.385 --> 11:33.083
Um, everyone wants
a slice of Eugene.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.309
Are you coming back
anytime soon?

11:41.352 --> 11:42.571
To be honest,

11:42.614 --> 11:44.486
I haven't given much thought
to a timetable,

11:44.529 --> 11:49.317
but it is mighty good
to hear your voice.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.232
You, too.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.019
Hold on.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.195
We got
a malfunction.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.719
Mother of pearl.

11:59.762 --> 12:02.852
Everything okay?

12:02.896 --> 12:03.897
Bad solder.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.768
It was a gaffe
on my part.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.596
I'm gonna have to
fix this pronto

12:07.639 --> 12:09.990
before the whole thing
goes FUBAR.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.774
I should
get back into bed anyway.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.515
Do you want me to call you
this afternoon?

12:13.558 --> 12:16.039
Are radio waves sinusoidal?

12:17.649 --> 12:20.435
Um,  yes?

12:20.478 --> 12:23.743
Yes.
Yes, they are.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.615
Ugh.

12:26.658 --> 12:29.270
So close.

12:31.228 --> 12:33.753
Ew.

12:35.450 --> 12:36.668
Ugh.

12:36.712 --> 12:39.497
Mr. Crossbow,
I thought aiming was your thing.

12:41.325 --> 12:44.241
It's definitely
not your thing.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.810
Mnh-mnh.
Sorry, it doesn't count.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.246
'Course that counts.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.421
No, you gotta
knock the can over.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.423
You can't just
kiss it.
Oh, my God.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.425
You're such
a sore loser.

12:54.469 --> 12:57.298
I'd have to lose
in order to be a sore loser,

12:57.341 --> 12:58.690
so since
that didn't count,

12:58.734 --> 13:00.214
I'm gonna
take my turn.

13:00.257 --> 13:04.522
Oh,
it's a double-capper.

13:04.566 --> 13:07.090
They're good luck.

13:07.134 --> 13:10.050
Maybe it'll help
your aim.

13:10.093 --> 13:11.138
Very funny.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.487
But I'll keep it.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.706
You should watch
your own throws, though.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.405
Boom.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.409
How was Hilltop?

13:21.452 --> 13:22.671
It was fine.

13:22.714 --> 13:25.935
King sends his best.

13:25.979 --> 13:29.373
Connie fine, too?

13:31.985 --> 13:33.595
What?

13:33.638 --> 13:36.772
I see things.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.295
It's not like that.

13:38.339 --> 13:39.688
No?

13:39.731 --> 13:42.169
Not at all.

13:42.212 --> 13:45.781
Why not?

13:47.565 --> 13:50.394
Aren't that many people left
to find out there these days,

13:50.438 --> 13:53.397
much less
good ones like her.

13:53.441 --> 13:54.877
Yeah, I know.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.966
Well, then why not?

13:57.010 --> 13:58.968
What's it matter?

13:59.012 --> 14:01.666
'Cause it does.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.408
You don't
have to be alone.

14:04.452 --> 14:07.411
Years pass,
Daryl.

14:07.455 --> 14:10.240
You can't hide out
with your dog forever.

14:15.158 --> 14:16.377
Oh, see?

14:16.420 --> 14:19.554
Your aim's
better already.

14:19.597 --> 14:22.035
I'm hungry.
You got food?

14:22.078 --> 14:24.907
Yeah,
I'll get it.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.574
Thanks.

14:39.617 --> 14:40.923
Mm-hmm.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.712
Mmm.

14:47.756 --> 14:50.324
Hey,
you see that?

15:04.947 --> 15:07.732
It's a Whisperer.

15:20.658 --> 15:24.140
He cannot be trusted.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.186
Dispose of him.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.889
Test him.

15:33.933 --> 15:39.677
If he is worthy,
I will hear him.

15:39.721 --> 15:43.290
If not,
then I kill him.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.293
You have other thoughts?

15:46.336 --> 15:50.253
It is a mistake
showing him our ways.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.780
Your questionin'
of my judgment

15:55.824 --> 15:57.608
has become
a regular occurrence.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.133
He is a threat.

16:01.699 --> 16:05.355
To Alpha or to Beta?

16:08.315 --> 16:11.579
I think
only of our people.

16:16.932 --> 16:19.456
Is it finally time

16:19.500 --> 16:23.025
for the Beta
to become the Alpha?

16:37.083 --> 16:39.520
Never.

16:48.181 --> 16:50.400
How long you and the boss lady
been together?

16:50.444 --> 16:53.403
Is this, like, a
Beta-with-benefits situation?

16:53.447 --> 16:55.188
Do you slide her a little omega
on the side?

16:55.231 --> 16:57.320
You'll respect
the Alpha,

16:57.364 --> 17:00.019
or I end you
where you stand.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.585
I didn't mean
to offend you.

17:01.629 --> 17:05.111
I mean, hell,
you keep things professional.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.590
I respect that.

17:06.634 --> 17:09.071
Think I was just thrown off
by the whole kneelin' thing.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.030
Not that
there's anything wrong

17:11.073 --> 17:12.988
with the whole
kneelin' thing.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.859
I mean,
that has tickled the dicks

17:14.903 --> 17:17.384
of many a fine man
over the years.

17:17.427 --> 17:20.996
Me, myself, I used to
have people kneelin' for me

17:21.040 --> 17:22.215
all the livelong day,

17:22.258 --> 17:24.086
so I do understand
the benefits

17:24.130 --> 17:25.653
that sort of shit
provides.

17:25.696 --> 17:29.091
Just actually
never done the deed myself.

17:30.919 --> 17:32.964
And I admire
your self-restraint,

17:33.008 --> 17:35.706
and I'm sayin' this
totally respectfully,

17:35.750 --> 17:38.492
but there is somethin' about
that whole bald-head thing

17:38.535 --> 17:40.276
that just

17:40.320 --> 17:42.365
tightens my britches.

17:44.019 --> 17:46.065
Rosita? Gabriel?

17:46.108 --> 17:49.546
Just wanted to swing by to grab
a change of clothes for Coco.

17:52.332 --> 17:53.550
Hey, you.

17:53.594 --> 17:56.075
I think I need
a house call, Doc.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.250
Hm.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.165
I thought we were
supposed to be in bed.

17:59.208 --> 18:02.124
I was,
and then I was feeling better,

18:02.168 --> 18:03.473
so I came downstairs.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.127
And then
I was feeling even worse,

18:05.171 --> 18:06.476
so now I'm stuck.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.131
Well, you shoulda called Gabe
to come get me.

18:09.175 --> 18:12.308
Ah, the Good Shepherd
is out on patrol.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.701
Overnighter.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.746
Okay.

18:15.790 --> 18:18.749
Well, field trip
to the infirmary.

18:18.793 --> 18:20.882
No, come on, Siddiq.
I have so much to do.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.927
I know,
like going to the infirmary.

18:22.971 --> 18:24.190
No, no, no, no.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.757
If you just help me
get to the garage so...

18:26.801 --> 18:29.151
Yeah.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.022
Shit.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.546
No. Okay.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.722
Look,
it's a crazy idea,

18:34.765 --> 18:38.639
but how about we all go
to the infirmary?

18:38.682 --> 18:41.555
Mm? Yeah?
Coco says yeah.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.165
Let's go.

18:43.209 --> 18:46.212
Easy.

18:57.353 --> 19:00.182
This is Hilltop callin' over
to Alexandria.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.576
Do you copy?

19:06.841 --> 19:10.453
Alexandria, let us know
if you are receivin'.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.459
Alexandria proper,
please respond.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.779
Greetings.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.825
This is Tater Bug,
callin' live over open channels.

19:34.869 --> 19:37.088
Anyone out there,
give us a copy.

19:46.446 --> 19:48.012
Carol:
It's getting bigger.

19:48.056 --> 19:51.451
Yeah, looks like they're
gatherin' up all the strays.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.192
Well,
once the sun goes down,

19:53.235 --> 19:54.976
it's gonna be tough
to see where they go

19:55.019 --> 19:56.978
unless
we can get closer.

19:57.021 --> 20:00.068
What makes you think
they're goin' anywhere?

20:00.111 --> 20:02.592
If you and me
were Whisperers,

20:02.636 --> 20:04.420
that's when
we'd move 'em.

20:04.464 --> 20:07.162
You know I'm right.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.687
You wanna cross the border,
don't ya?

20:10.731 --> 20:13.560
I wanna find the horde.
If that's what it takes...

20:15.126 --> 20:16.302
Sure this isn't you

20:16.345 --> 20:17.781
just tryin'
to take another shot at Alpha?

20:17.825 --> 20:19.740
The horde is our shot.

20:19.783 --> 20:21.785
You changin' your mind?

20:21.829 --> 20:25.267
Nope.
I didn't say that.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.662
Then what's the problem?

20:31.099 --> 20:33.754
Alright, we do this,
we gotta be smart about it.

20:33.797 --> 20:36.409
None of this "runnin' off
in the middle of the night,

20:36.452 --> 20:39.107
no backup, just us"
stuff, alright?

20:40.456 --> 20:43.242
Since when
are we not enough?

20:46.593 --> 20:47.724
You know,
we mess this up,

20:47.768 --> 20:52.512
everyone else
is gonna pay for it, right?

20:52.555 --> 20:53.121
We've already paid.

20:53.164 --> 20:54.557
We keep paying

20:54.601 --> 20:57.604
no matter what
side of the line we're on.

21:06.395 --> 21:09.224
I gotta pee.

21:39.385 --> 21:41.865
Did you find
what you were lookin' for?

21:44.607 --> 21:47.306
You bring the gun?

21:47.349 --> 21:48.916
No.

21:48.959 --> 21:51.701
Used up all the ammunition,
remember?

21:51.745 --> 21:54.791
There was still some ammo left
in the storage room.

21:54.835 --> 21:58.752
I didn't
bring the gun, Daryl.

21:58.795 --> 22:00.797
Wanna frisk me?

22:00.841 --> 22:02.799
Go ahead.

22:02.843 --> 22:05.367
Okay.

22:09.980 --> 22:13.680
Either we're enough,
or we're not.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.816
Alright,
let's do it.

22:19.860 --> 22:23.080
A plan this stupid,
might as well be us.

22:43.187 --> 22:45.625
So,
do I get bathed

22:45.668 --> 22:48.845
and reborn
in her Whisper-y image,

22:48.889 --> 22:52.632
or is this more like
a ball-trippin',

22:52.675 --> 22:55.765
skin-themed vision quest?

22:56.549 --> 22:58.202
Dig.

22:59.726 --> 23:01.641
That's it?

23:01.684 --> 23:04.252
I can do that.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.868
Anything in particular
we're goin' for here?

23:11.912 --> 23:13.479
Size, depth, width?

23:13.522 --> 23:16.264
Just dig.

23:19.136 --> 23:22.444
Alright.

All these people
do the twist.

25:47.110 --> 25:48.634
Siddiq:
Watch your step.

25:48.677 --> 25:51.071
Here we go.

25:51.114 --> 25:53.290
Yeah. Okay.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.641
Looks like
I'm not the only one.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.294
Yeah.

25:57.338 --> 26:00.297
Let's get you
a seat.

26:00.341 --> 26:02.299
Dante?

26:02.343 --> 26:04.258
Dante: Go ahead
and grab a seat wherever.

26:04.301 --> 26:07.435
I'll be with you
in a sec.

26:07.478 --> 26:10.351
Dante, what the hell
is goin' on?

26:10.394 --> 26:11.482
Hey, guys.

26:11.526 --> 26:13.920
I-I-I think the illness
is spreading

26:13.963 --> 26:15.095
faster than
we thought.

26:15.138 --> 26:16.618
I-I didn't want
to bother you.

26:16.662 --> 26:19.273
That is not a decision
you get to make.

26:19.316 --> 26:22.232
Damn it, man, this is why I said
I shouldn't leave.

26:22.276 --> 26:23.886
Hey, Siddiq, he's --
What?

26:23.930 --> 26:26.236
He's tryin' to help.

26:27.716 --> 26:30.371
Start crushing herbs --

26:30.414 --> 26:32.199
ginger and mint
for the nausea

26:32.242 --> 26:34.331
and oil of oregano
and yarrow for the fever.

26:34.375 --> 26:35.811
Alright.

26:35.855 --> 26:39.249
This is only gonna get worse
if we're not ahead of it.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.688
You good
with these rules?

26:42.731 --> 26:45.125
Yeah.
Don't be seen.

26:45.168 --> 26:48.215
No tracks,
no killin' walkers neither.

26:48.258 --> 26:49.869
Find a bunch of bodies
with holes in their heads,

26:49.912 --> 26:52.698
we might as well leave a note
saying we were here.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.789
Watch, learn, leave.

26:56.832 --> 27:01.315
Yeah, if things go sideways,
we head back.

27:01.358 --> 27:02.316
We get split up,

27:02.359 --> 27:04.057
you meet me
right here, alright?

27:04.100 --> 27:05.406
Yeah.

27:05.449 --> 27:08.235
And be safe.

27:08.278 --> 27:11.630
We got luck on our side,
alright?

27:11.673 --> 27:15.546
Come on.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.636
Negan:
My porky here,

27:17.679 --> 27:19.638
he was a bastard
to take down.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.640
But I gotta say, this is exactly
the kind of badass shit

27:21.683 --> 27:23.511
I will do
for my new family.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.295
Beta: Only those
who have earned

27:25.339 --> 27:28.342
the right
to walk among us may eat.

27:29.865 --> 27:31.388
Earned?

27:31.432 --> 27:32.825
Big man,

27:32.868 --> 27:37.177
I helped kill
and cook the damn pig.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.353
Come on, man, alright?

27:39.396 --> 27:40.441
At the very least,

27:40.484 --> 27:43.574
I deserve
a piece of bacon.

28:03.551 --> 28:06.293
Whatever you say,
boss.

28:31.361 --> 28:33.537
This is Tater Bug over open air,

28:33.581 --> 28:36.584
surfin' on
these proverbial radio waves.

28:36.627 --> 28:39.152
Any interested earholes,
come on back.

28:46.202 --> 28:47.943
Anyone anywhere?

28:47.987 --> 28:51.512
This is Tater Bug.

28:58.649 --> 29:00.173
Woman: Hello?

29:00.216 --> 29:02.175
Hello, Tater Bug?

29:03.654 --> 29:05.395
I receive you
loud and clear.

29:05.439 --> 29:07.746
I-I can't believe this.

29:07.789 --> 29:11.401
Are you --
Are you really out there?

30:16.292 --> 30:18.120
Man:
Not here.

30:20.731 --> 30:25.345
Woman:
Keep looking.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.876
Well, had I considered
the prospect of first contact,

30:34.920 --> 30:36.704
I would've prepared
proper remarks

30:36.747 --> 30:38.488
toward the establishin'
of relations.

30:38.532 --> 30:40.055
Over.

30:40.099 --> 30:41.752
Woman: I don't quite know
what to say, either.

30:41.796 --> 30:43.276
I'd gotten
to the point

30:43.319 --> 30:44.886
where I figured
this was a waste of time.

30:44.930 --> 30:47.106
Over.

30:47.149 --> 30:50.065
Well, perhaps an exchange
of Q&As might grease the wheels.

30:50.109 --> 30:52.111
A few
right off the top of my dome --

30:52.154 --> 30:54.765
where are you located,
how long have you been there,

30:54.809 --> 30:56.071
how many people
do you have,

30:56.115 --> 30:58.857
and should we continue
saying "over"?

30:58.900 --> 31:00.380
Over.

31:00.423 --> 31:03.252
We can probably make do
without the "overs."

31:03.296 --> 31:05.689
As for
the other stuff,

31:05.733 --> 31:10.259
I don't think I'm comfortable
sharing that just yet.

31:10.303 --> 31:11.957
Understandable.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.177
Any alts more within
your zone of comfort?

31:15.221 --> 31:18.877
Maybe talk about our lives
before all this?

31:18.920 --> 31:22.489
My personal origin entails
a long and storied history.

31:22.532 --> 31:23.882
Were you thinkin' prologue,

31:23.925 --> 31:25.840
or should I skip ahead
a few chapters?

31:25.884 --> 31:28.669
I guess, uh,
start with where you're from.

31:28.712 --> 31:29.844
Certainly.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.890
A Lone Star child
at heart,

31:31.933 --> 31:33.804
I was born
in the shadows of Big D.

31:33.848 --> 31:36.807
That's a well-worn nickname
for Dallas, Texas.

31:36.851 --> 31:38.592
Yeah,
I picked up on that.

31:38.635 --> 31:40.159
I grew up
in Pennsylvania,

31:40.202 --> 31:42.465
a small town
called Strasburg.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.903
Uh,
dubious as it may seem,

31:44.946 --> 31:46.992
I know
Strasburg, Pennsylvania, well.

31:47.035 --> 31:49.908
Sure you do.True as Coventry blue.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.126
Durin' adolescence,

31:51.170 --> 31:53.694
I went through
a significant foamer phase.

31:53.737 --> 31:55.391
Locomotives were my jam.

31:55.435 --> 31:56.740
As such,
my parents purchased

31:56.784 --> 31:59.352
a pair of tickets
to the 1995 Trainfan Expo

31:59.395 --> 32:02.268
at the Railroad Museum
in, well, you guessed it.

32:02.311 --> 32:04.531
Strasburg, Pennsylvania.

32:04.574 --> 32:05.836
Whoa.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.970
I have the most vivid memory
of an ice-cream shop

32:09.014 --> 32:13.105
with the most marvelous batch
of black raspberry ice cream.

32:13.148 --> 32:14.193
The Inside Scoop.

32:14.236 --> 32:15.977
Went there all the time.

32:16.021 --> 32:19.763
Hell, you and I might've
been there on the same day.

32:21.287 --> 32:22.505
Well,
knowin' this,

32:22.549 --> 32:24.855
there's a critical question
needs answerin'.

32:24.899 --> 32:26.161
What's that?

32:27.423 --> 32:29.208
Cake cone or waffle?

33:48.635 --> 33:51.594
Been decades
since I got this much attention

33:51.638 --> 33:53.596
from younger men.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.120
Well,
you're my patient,

33:55.163 --> 33:59.124
so it's kinda my job
to keep an eye on you.

33:59.167 --> 34:01.952
Then what's with the look
of gloom and doom?

34:01.996 --> 34:06.174
I feel like I'm nappin'
next to the grim reaper.

34:09.438 --> 34:10.961
Sorry.

34:11.005 --> 34:12.963
Sorry.

34:13.007 --> 34:17.620
I'm just,
um, a little concerned.

34:17.664 --> 34:23.148
Oh, hon, in this world,
most don't get the luxury

34:23.191 --> 34:26.803
of driftin' off
in a nice, comfy bed.

34:26.847 --> 34:30.285
I should be
so lucky.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.989
Get some rest.

34:39.251 --> 34:41.949
Hey, hey,
I'll get it for you.

34:41.992 --> 34:43.385
Oh, thanks, man.

34:44.691 --> 34:49.565
About what I said earlier,
I, um...

34:50.349 --> 34:52.133
No worries.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.656
I get it.

34:53.700 --> 34:56.616
We're stuck with
pre-industrial-age meds,

34:56.659 --> 35:00.881
and simple shit can suddenly
become a big deal.

35:00.924 --> 35:02.796
We'll figure it out.

35:02.839 --> 35:05.799
Thanks, Dante.

35:05.842 --> 35:09.411
I-I appreciate
your help.

35:11.283 --> 35:14.068
You should.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.332
I'm kind of amazing.

35:20.683 --> 35:22.250
Get some rest,
boss.

35:22.294 --> 35:24.905
Alright, come on.

35:28.865 --> 35:31.085
Mm.

35:37.526 --> 35:39.746
Hey, Coco.

35:39.789 --> 35:41.095
Hey.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.097
It's okay.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.273
It's okay.
Shh.

35:45.317 --> 35:47.101
Aww, it's okay.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.711
Uh, Daddy gotcha.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.539
Oh, it's alright.

35:50.583 --> 35:53.716
Hey.
Hey, it's okay.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.109
Hey.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.459
No, no, no, no.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.809
Oh, it's okay.

36:03.726 --> 36:05.859
There you go.

36:42.939 --> 36:46.769
Alpha:
Open your eyes.

36:50.599 --> 36:53.341
Open your eyes.

36:57.258 --> 37:00.043
Open your eyes.

37:30.683 --> 37:32.641
Clearly,
we are not jivin'.

37:32.685 --> 37:34.861
And, you know,
to be honest with you,

37:34.904 --> 37:36.428
I totally understand
the position you're in.

37:36.471 --> 37:37.820
You gotta be, like,

37:37.864 --> 37:39.648
the tough guy
and keep everybody in line.

37:39.692 --> 37:40.954
I mean,
hell, you know,

37:40.997 --> 37:44.653
I had guys just like you
to keep my shit tight.

37:44.697 --> 37:47.395
Alright,
maybe not just like you.

37:47.439 --> 37:49.832
Uh, hell, if I had some monster
your size,

37:49.876 --> 37:52.008
things would've
turned out different.

37:52.052 --> 37:54.489
Look,
whether you like me or not,

37:54.533 --> 37:56.230
I will be joinin'
this team,

37:56.274 --> 37:58.885
so maybe we should find a way
to get along, you know,

37:58.928 --> 38:00.930
and stop pissin'
on each other's boots.

38:00.974 --> 38:05.108
You will never
be one of us.

38:05.152 --> 38:08.024
You're too loud,

38:08.068 --> 38:13.813
too weak,
too full of ego.

38:13.856 --> 38:16.032
I mean,
it ain't ego

38:16.076 --> 38:18.383
if I really am
that awesome.

38:18.426 --> 38:21.908
You are a waste,

38:21.951 --> 38:25.346
and Alpha
will see it.

38:25.390 --> 38:28.480
So cards on the table,
then?

38:28.523 --> 38:30.569
Cool.
I dig that.

38:30.612 --> 38:33.354
See,
I'm not here for you.

38:33.398 --> 38:35.356
I am here for Alpha.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.618
So you go ahead,

38:36.662 --> 38:38.577
and you throw
your little tests at me

38:38.620 --> 38:40.274
and you scowl

38:40.318 --> 38:42.711
and throw me on the ground like
a five-and-dime Frankenstein.

38:42.755 --> 38:45.540
I don't give a shit.

38:45.584 --> 38:48.848
See, big man,

38:48.891 --> 38:51.416
I ain't goin' anywhere.

38:53.896 --> 38:56.116
Finally,

38:56.159 --> 39:00.120
something we can
both agree on.

39:00.163 --> 39:04.124
You won't be
going anywhere.

39:08.520 --> 39:09.825
Wait a minute.

39:09.869 --> 39:13.481
Did you just make
a Goddamn joke?

39:13.525 --> 39:15.657
I would be impressed

39:15.701 --> 39:19.487
if I wasn't
so pissed off right now.

39:21.881 --> 39:25.188
You have got
to be shittin' me.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.820
What the hell
is this?

39:47.863 --> 39:48.995
He saw me.

39:49.038 --> 39:51.519
We can take him back,
see what he knows.

39:51.563 --> 39:52.520
Maybe it's a good thing.

39:52.564 --> 39:55.567
Did you plan this?

39:55.610 --> 39:57.482
No.

40:01.050 --> 40:02.922
What's this?

40:04.227 --> 40:07.100
It wasn't
in your bag.

40:07.143 --> 40:09.232
Guess you missed it.

40:09.276 --> 40:11.583
Come on.
We don't have time to argue.

40:11.626 --> 40:13.193
It's done.

40:23.290 --> 40:26.859
Roller rinks never made much
dollars-and-centavos sense

40:26.902 --> 40:28.904
to me, purely on
a risk/reward analysis.

40:28.948 --> 40:32.212
Too afraid of falling?

40:32.908 --> 40:35.171
Injury combined
with humiliation.

40:35.215 --> 40:38.261
Not my favorite pastime.

40:44.790 --> 40:46.487
This deet exchange
on our formatives

40:46.531 --> 40:50.926
has been
very enjoyable, and...

40:50.970 --> 40:54.495
at the risk
of said humiliation,

40:54.539 --> 40:58.456
I wonder if we could dip
our toes into some real talk.

41:01.415 --> 41:04.374
I...

41:04.418 --> 41:08.683
It's been great,
honestly.

41:08.727 --> 41:11.991
But I don't
really know you.

41:12.034 --> 41:14.167
You might be a threat.

41:16.430 --> 41:17.866
Maybe it's better

41:17.910 --> 41:22.349
if we let this be,
you know, what it is.

41:27.397 --> 41:31.184
What if I were
to share specifics?

41:31.227 --> 41:35.188
Who's to say
I'm not a threat to you?

41:35.231 --> 41:39.584
People are dangerous.

41:39.627 --> 41:42.369
I'm well aware.

41:42.412 --> 41:46.416
And yet,
I have a twinge in my belly

41:46.460 --> 41:48.418
that says
you lean toward

41:48.462 --> 41:51.421
the "good" column
of the alignment chart.

41:51.465 --> 41:53.728
I do know you.

41:57.602 --> 42:01.388
My given name
is Eugene Hermann Porter,

42:01.431 --> 42:05.218
and I propose we continue
these convos on the reg,

42:05.261 --> 42:07.437
with the hopes
of buildin' more.

42:07.481 --> 42:10.223
Should that meet
with your approval

42:10.266 --> 42:13.531
and/or interest,
of course.

42:30.504 --> 42:35.683
Hello,
Eugene Hermann Porter.

42:35.727 --> 42:37.946
I'd like that.

42:37.990 --> 42:40.862
I'd like that
very much indeed.

42:40.906 --> 42:45.606
So we're in agreement,
then.

42:45.650 --> 42:47.956
We are.

42:48.000 --> 42:54.136
But -- But let's just keep this
between us for now.

42:54.180 --> 42:56.878
I wanna trust you,

42:56.922 --> 43:00.665
but if I hear anyone else,
I'll know I can't.

43:02.536 --> 43:05.365
And you'll never
hear from me again.

43:07.585 --> 43:11.023
Okay,
just you and me.

43:11.066 --> 43:12.720
Copy that.

43:12.764 --> 43:15.288
Over.

43:33.785 --> 43:37.179
He was weak.

43:39.225 --> 43:40.487
I expected more.

43:40.530 --> 43:43.098
He will serve us better
as one of the dead.

43:43.142 --> 43:45.579
Negan: I'm ready
for my Goddamn skin suit.

43:45.623 --> 43:49.148
You best bring
that extra-long tape measure

43:49.191 --> 43:54.196
on account
of my humongous balls.

43:57.243 --> 44:00.638
Hi.
I'm Negan.

44:00.681 --> 44:03.597
We haven't
formally met,

44:03.641 --> 44:06.818
but I sure as hell
know who you are.

44:09.081 --> 44:14.608
And whether my reputation
precedes me or not...

44:20.788 --> 44:23.356
...I'm all in.

44:23.399 --> 44:28.013
Whatever you want,
whatever I got,

44:28.056 --> 44:30.406
it's yours.

44:53.516 --> 44:55.997
Shh.
