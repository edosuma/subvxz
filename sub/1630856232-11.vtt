[ Bebe Rexha & David Guetta's
"One in a Million" plays ]

00:08.591 --> 00:10.260
Wow!

00:10.301 --> 00:11.845
John: You two were electric.

00:11.886 --> 00:15.098
[ Whoosh ]
Daly: That's the sound
of a steal!

00:16.266 --> 00:18.018
* Is this heaven now? *

00:18.059 --> 00:19.769
* Am I dreaming out? *

00:19.811 --> 00:21.187
* Am I dreaming? *

00:21.229 --> 00:22.981
John: It's so fun.
I love watching the battles.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.774
Yeah, the battles are good
because you get this, like,

00:24.816 --> 00:26.985
"Oh, I remember that audition.
I remember that audition."

00:27.027 --> 00:29.446
Yes.
You're like, "Oh, everyone
is actually really good."

00:29.487 --> 00:31.573
Both Niall and I tried
to steal someone,

00:31.614 --> 00:35.702
and then...Gwen unceremoniously
rejected us

00:35.744 --> 00:37.704
and destroyed our hopes
and dreams.

00:37.746 --> 00:38.872
You nailed it.

00:38.913 --> 00:40.874
Both: Gwen.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.250
I don't have
any more steals.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.918
Oh, your two were great
that you did steal.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.755
I love my newbies.
Yeah. I love mine.
Thank you.

00:46.796 --> 00:49.841
I'm a very hard worker,
I'm a very hard singer,

00:49.883 --> 00:51.885
so somebody hit that button.

00:51.926 --> 00:55.055
Daly: We got a steal!
You knew it was gonna be me.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.389
A lot of times,
you steal someone

00:56.431 --> 00:57.724
that you tried to get
in the blinds.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.267
I tried to get Mac
in the blinds,

00:59.309 --> 01:01.019
and he was available.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.312
[ Whoosh ]

01:02.354 --> 01:04.397
That's the sound
of a steal!

01:04.439 --> 01:05.607
I was like, "Come on."

01:05.648 --> 01:07.233
Come on home, bro.
Mac: Come on.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.735
I know what
I'm looking for.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.695
Okay. You got a plan?
Oh, really?

01:10.737 --> 01:12.864
I do.
I've got my eyes on someone,
but I'll probably lose to Gwen.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.241
You won't lose the Gwen.
It's impossible.
There's no competition.

01:15.283 --> 01:16.576
It's actually impossible
to lose to you now.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.286
Let's go.
I got to steal to make.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.205
I'm waiting for you guys
to make bad decisions for me.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.247
What are you gonna do?

01:21.289 --> 01:22.374
I'm gonna go
watch a concert.

Let's do it.

Audrey: Okay, so, Reba,
what is your strategy?

01:29.172 --> 01:31.424
I thought Ruby and Al
would go great together.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.927
Yeah, great.
You know,
two country people.

01:33.968 --> 01:36.262
You're gonna be
giving them great advice.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.847
Thanks, thanks.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.141
Al and Ruby -- both country,

01:40.183 --> 01:42.268
a little bluegrass,
country in there.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.647
And I have them singing
Dolly Parton's "Jolene."

01:45.689 --> 01:48.358
"Jolene" is a little bit more
in the traditional vein

01:48.400 --> 01:52.570
of country music, and I thought
that would be very cool.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.447
Ruby: I'm, like,
super excited.

01:54.489 --> 01:57.075
I mean, hello, it's Reba.
I know.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.326
Right?
We're fixing to be

01:58.368 --> 02:00.870
in the presence
of a one-name superstar.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.123
I hope I can sing
when I'm in front of her.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.874
Come on in.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.460
Hey, hey!
Hi. How are you?

02:07.502 --> 02:09.796
[ Laughing ]
I love your T-shirt.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.549
Oh, my gosh. Love it.
Oh, this old thing here?

02:12.590 --> 02:14.926
It was a tough decision
to try to figure out

02:14.968 --> 02:16.845
if I wanted to wear
the black Reba shirt

02:16.886 --> 02:18.430
or the white Reba shirt.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.182
Went with the white. I feel like
it's a little more casual.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.809
The black one's
a little dressier.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.937
I'll probably save that one
for church Sunday. [ Laughs ]

02:25.979 --> 02:27.814
Reba: Gosh, I've been
looking forward to this

02:27.856 --> 02:30.191
since the first day
I heard you guys sing.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.484
So excited.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.486
Ruby: It was so hard
to look at her.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.571
Wow.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.364
This is Reba.
I'm like...

02:36.406 --> 02:37.782
I didn't want to be creepy

02:37.824 --> 02:39.701
where I was just, like,
staring at her.

02:39.743 --> 02:42.996
So I was like,
maybe don't look at her so much.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.415
[ Chuckles ] I was like --
It was insane.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.625
So, how y'all feel
about doing "Jolene"?

02:47.667 --> 02:49.502
It's one of my favorite songs
of all time.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.254
Good.
Yeah.
It's a great song.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.089
Well,
I'm a huge fan of Dolly.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.799
I got to meet her
on the first time

02:54.841 --> 02:57.886
that I ever got to be
on the Grand Ole Opry in 1977.

02:57.927 --> 03:01.389
Wow.
They told me that I wasn't
gonna get to do my two songs.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.141
I'm just gonna be able
to do one song.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.684
And I said, "Why?"
And they said,

03:04.726 --> 03:06.811
"Because Dolly Parton
just pulled in the parking lot

03:06.853 --> 03:08.563
and she's gonna take
one of your songs."

03:08.605 --> 03:11.274
And I said, "Well, shoot,
she can take both of them.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.984
Can I meet her?"
[ Laughter ]

03:13.026 --> 03:16.196
Well, I can't wait to hear y'all
sing, so let's get after it.

03:16.237 --> 03:20.617
* Jolene, Jolene,
Jolene, Jolene *

03:20.658 --> 03:22.535
Al: This song
is going to be perfect

03:22.577 --> 03:25.663
because it gets thrown around
at the house all the time.

03:25.705 --> 03:29.042
* Jolene, Jolene*

03:29.084 --> 03:32.837
The kids want to listen
to "Jolene" every afternoon.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.381
I love my kids.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.549
Being a dad is the coolest
thing I've ever done.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.886
They were so sad that Dad
didn't make it last season.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.721
I really felt
kind of out of place.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.598
I felt like I was
just, like, so close,

03:43.640 --> 03:46.518
but I just needed
to take a few more steps.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.228
So, this go-around...

03:48.269 --> 03:52.482
* Just somethin' women like
about a pickup man *

03:52.524 --> 03:55.902
...when that stage lit up,
it was just like,

03:55.944 --> 03:58.655
"Yeah, man, you were right.
You can do this."
Ow!

03:58.697 --> 04:01.116
What style of country
would you call that, Reba?

04:01.157 --> 04:02.826
With a capital "C" --
Country.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.370
[ Laughter ]
Yes, that's what
I grew up with.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.706
Big part of my upbringing was
listening to you on the radio.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.332
I'm a big fan
already.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.584
And now I'm so proud to be able

04:11.626 --> 04:13.795
to walk this journey
with my family.

04:13.837 --> 04:17.841
Gonna be able to show them
that one "no" is not the end.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.677
Like Reba,
Dolly Parton is someone

04:20.719 --> 04:22.762
that I've looked up to
for a long time.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.764
I actually won
a Dolly Parton competition,

04:24.806 --> 04:27.267
and I won a signed guitar
from her.

04:27.308 --> 04:30.395
Dolly -- she's been singing
for pretty much her whole life.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.688
I really connect with that

04:31.730 --> 04:33.023
because I started
when I was nine,

04:33.064 --> 04:36.818
but now I usually do about
200 shows a year.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.320
You know, and being able
to travel is awesome,

04:39.362 --> 04:41.239
especially coming
from such a small town.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.616
68 people.
It is not big at all.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.286
We don't even know our
neighbors, which is hilarious.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.663
[ Yodeling ]

04:48.705 --> 04:51.124
It was so amazing
to get four people

04:51.166 --> 04:53.835
that I absolutely look up to,
to turn around.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.462
Just insane.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.630
You can win "The Voice,"
honestly.
Yeah.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.341
It would be
a great idea

04:59.382 --> 05:01.760
if we got
the audience's opinion.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.179
Alright, audience.
What do you think?

05:04.220 --> 05:05.930
What?!
[ Laughs ]

05:05.972 --> 05:09.642
What is this nonsense?
We're being sabotaged.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.644
You're cheating!
I feel so sorry for us.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.104
Reba.
Whoo!

05:13.146 --> 05:16.107
Having Reba as my coach
is super exciting.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.942
We're both from small towns.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.986
You know, in my heart,
I just knew I had to pick Reba.

05:20.028 --> 05:23.156
She's so versatile.
She can do anything.

05:23.198 --> 05:26.659
I'm excited
being on her first-ever team.

05:26.701 --> 05:31.998

Look at me. Come on.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.090
* Jolene, Jolene *

05:40.131 --> 05:42.801
Al is real low, big voice.

05:42.842 --> 05:47.222
And Ruby, she has a higher
alto-soprano range.

05:47.263 --> 05:51.351
And the different textures
complemented each other.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.269
Your vocals are great.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.021
I don't feel it, though.
Okay.

05:55.063 --> 05:58.692
When you're singing a song,
it's this right here.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.735
It's got to come out
in your face.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.822
You've got the cutest
dimples in the world.
Thank you.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.699
We need to see
more of those.

06:05.740 --> 06:09.536
And be a little mischievous,
but also be heartbroken

06:09.577 --> 06:11.996
because you're pleading
with this woman

06:12.038 --> 06:13.873
to back off, get out.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.793
You're talking to her,
but you're talking to the women

06:16.835 --> 06:18.712
and the people
in the audience.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.464
So, if you kind of run
like a typewriter

06:21.506 --> 06:23.008
and just look at people,

06:23.049 --> 06:25.844
you'll make their experience
a billion times better.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.014
Ruby: I'm 16 and I've never
been in a relationship,

06:29.055 --> 06:30.890
so I don't really know how
to portray that.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.434
Reba: Play like
I'm the other woman

06:32.475 --> 06:33.727
that's trying
to take your partner.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.104
But I do understand
that it's painful,

06:36.146 --> 06:38.273
so I can relate to her
with that...

06:38.314 --> 06:40.233
* Please don't
take my man *

06:40.275 --> 06:42.318
...because I feel
a huge connection

06:42.360 --> 06:44.779
to her struggles
with separation anxiety.

06:44.821 --> 06:49.492
When I was just a little kid,
I was in a tornado.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.202
It ripped through Missouri.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.997
We were actually in my parents'
business at the time.

06:54.039 --> 06:57.459
It ripped the roof off and blew
the sides of the walls down,

06:57.500 --> 07:00.587
and then out of nowhere, you
just saw power lines snapping,

07:00.628 --> 07:02.297
just everything exploding.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.673
We got out.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.176
We made it to our car
and we made it home.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.552
After being in the tornado,

07:07.594 --> 07:09.471
it gave me really bad
separation anxiety.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.139
I couldn't be away
from my parents.

07:11.181 --> 07:14.642
Being able to play has really
been a release for me,

07:14.684 --> 07:17.270
and now I'm like 100% better.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.938
I credit music for that.

07:18.980 --> 07:22.233
When you're doing
the "Joleeene," just...

07:22.275 --> 07:24.569
* Jolene *

07:24.611 --> 07:26.613
Soften it up.
Soft landing. Got it.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.490
Al, it was great
on the eye contact.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.866
I'm on another planet
right now.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.202
I just made eye contact
with Reba McEntire

07:32.243 --> 07:36.081
and sang one of the most
iconic songs of all time.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.957
Reba: I was the only one
that turned for Al.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.210
I was just surprised.
He was selling it.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.796
* Your voice is soft
like summer rain *

07:42.837 --> 07:45.715
Ruby being 16,
she's got great range,

07:45.757 --> 07:47.634
but it's also flexible.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.135
You have to have that
to yodel.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.429
Ruby, I loved the way
your voice broke.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.057
That just gave it another
dimension. It was really good.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.810
Al, you got to map out
your breathing,

07:56.851 --> 07:58.645
because if you don't have
the breath,

07:58.687 --> 07:59.979
it ain't coming out
the mouth.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.940
Like, how do you keep
your voice in shape?

08:01.981 --> 08:04.651
So, I try to sing
every day.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.486
Stay hydrated.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.154
I had lunch
with Bette Midler.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.907
I'm going to pick that name up
here, that name dropper there.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.826
Oh, wow.
And these lozenges,

08:12.867 --> 08:16.329
she puts them kind of like Skoal
between her cheek and gum.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.873
Tom Jones --
I'll pick that one up, too --

08:18.915 --> 08:22.168
told her about it,
so they really help.
Alright.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.045
Ruby: It was awesome
to see Reba.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.506
Just the names she's dropped --
Like, this doesn't feel real.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.216
I'm like, there's no way.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.636
And the notes that she gave me
also helps me out tremendously.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.096
Now I know what
to really focus on.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.765
I'm gonna be a lot
more confident thanks to her.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.517
Y'all are great.

I made the right choice.

Well, Rudi, I'm Gwen.

Oh, I know who you are, girl.
I know who you are!

Gwen Stefani's been
my girl crush

19:04.519 --> 19:06.187

well, for forever.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.652
Her outfits,
her tone in her voice.

19:12.694 --> 19:14.320
She knows
how to put on a show.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.865
I have been obsessed
with her for years.

19:17.699 --> 19:21.619
* I'm so tired
of being here *

19:21.661 --> 19:23.621
Gwen: I feel like this
is kind of the perfect song

19:23.663 --> 19:26.708
because they both seem like
really good storytellers.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.878
* These wounds
won't seem to heal *

19:29.919 --> 19:32.505
* This pain is
just too real *

19:32.547 --> 19:34.674
Joslynn: My family does
foster care, and this song

19:34.716 --> 19:37.677
is just about
giving your all to somebody.

19:37.719 --> 19:41.431
And the last line of the chorus,
which really hits, is,

19:41.473 --> 19:43.475
"You still have all of me."

19:43.516 --> 19:47.354
* You still have *

19:47.395 --> 19:50.357
It's when you give them
yourself,

19:50.398 --> 19:52.442
no matter what
the end turnout is.

19:52.484 --> 19:56.613
And that's really
what foster care is.

19:56.654 --> 19:57.864
Yeah!

19:57.906 --> 20:01.368
I definitely get
a lot of time with my siblings

20:01.409 --> 20:03.787
and foster siblings
because I'm homeschooled.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.747
It's really a blessing
that I'm able to do that,

20:05.789 --> 20:10.877
and music can be focused on
a lot with being homeschooled.

20:10.919 --> 20:15.507
Currently with music, I am
leading worship at our church.

20:15.548 --> 20:21.721
I also do musicals
and little local talent shows,

20:21.763 --> 20:25.725

than the "Voice" stage.

The way that you sing
is so emotional.

20:56.464 --> 20:57.799
She's so fun.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.342
She is so warm

20:59.384 --> 21:01.219
and just really wants
to encourage you

21:01.261 --> 21:02.846
and wants you
to show your uniqueness.

21:20.822 --> 21:24.325
And, Joslynn, with you,
start to really think

21:24.367 --> 21:26.453
about opening your eyes up
a little bit more

21:26.494 --> 21:28.788
and stop focusing
on the vocal, right?

21:28.830 --> 21:30.999
'Cause your vocal is --
pfft! -- it's so good.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.918
But when you're singing,
I want your facial expressions

21:33.960 --> 21:37.380
to be with the lyric as opposed
to what you're singing.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.132
Even though you guys
are battling each other,

21:39.174 --> 21:42.677
you still need to show everybody
your, like, body language

21:42.719 --> 21:44.054
and how do you interact together

21:44.095 --> 21:45.889
so that you let go
of the competition

21:45.930 --> 21:48.141
and you just make
the greatest duet.

21:48.183 --> 21:52.312
* I held your hand
through all of these years *

21:52.354 --> 21:54.898
Rudi: I can connect to the song.
It's really about a loss.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.067
So I think just pulling
from those experiences

21:57.108 --> 21:59.027
and singing it
and taking myself back

21:59.069 --> 22:01.654
to that time where,
you know, I was hurting.

22:01.696 --> 22:05.575
For me, I think about my grandma
that I lost a few years ago.

22:05.617 --> 22:07.994
My grandparents were the ones
that loved music.

22:08.036 --> 22:10.914
My grandpa actually passed away
the year I was born,

22:10.955 --> 22:12.665
and I think that's why
me and my grandma

22:12.707 --> 22:14.793
had such an incredible bond.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.672
My grandma was my best friend,
my number-one supporter.

22:18.713 --> 22:20.674
She was everything to me.

22:20.715 --> 22:24.135
Even to this day,
I miss her every single day.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.598
She would just tell me
to have fun

22:28.640 --> 22:31.851
and go do what I know
how to do best.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.770
She would say,
"Shake your hips, mija."

22:33.812 --> 22:35.897
"Shake your hips."
[ Laughs ]

22:35.939 --> 22:38.191
That's exactly
what she would say.

22:38.233 --> 22:41.486
You know what's so cool
is to hear your style of voice

22:41.528 --> 22:42.779
on that song.

22:42.821 --> 22:45.407
I felt like that was
super understated,

22:45.448 --> 22:47.158
but just enough
that you're like,

22:47.200 --> 22:49.369
"Ooh, I forgot she can do that."

22:49.411 --> 22:51.955
Joslynn, you need to be
off the mic stand.
Exactly, yeah.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.290

that body language

that you're in it

what music does, right?

vessel to connect all of us.

she's so composed

Billie Eilish kind of dynamic

23:27.032 --> 23:30.618
to her voice,
and it's very stylized.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.913
she can do anything
with her voice,

but she was able to be
so tasteful with this song

23:36.833 --> 23:38.793
being that it's not
really her genre.

to compete in this show.

29:30.979 --> 29:32.981
The winner of this battle

29:33.023 --> 29:34.441
is gonna be Rudi.

29:34.482 --> 29:35.817
Rudi, congratulations!

29:35.859 --> 29:37.318
You're moving on
to the knockouts!

29:37.360 --> 29:39.487
Gwen: Rudi and Joslynn --
that was a tough one.

29:39.529 --> 29:43.283
Rudi knows when to do
a little trick and when not to.

29:43.324 --> 29:47.120
She is very tasteful
with the way she uses her voice.

29:47.162 --> 29:49.497
Stunning.
You're so amazing.

29:49.539 --> 29:51.583
I had to go with Rudi
because I just think she's ready

29:51.624 --> 29:53.752
for what's to come
in the competition.

29:53.793 --> 29:55.211
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.
I'll see ya.

29:55.253 --> 29:56.046
Thank you!

29:56.087 --> 29:57.464
I am so grateful to Gwen.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.382
I feel like
we're friends already.

29:59.424 --> 30:01.134
I don't know if that's
just me in my head,

30:01.176 --> 30:02.844
but she's just, like --
she's so personable,

30:02.886 --> 30:06.139
and I'm just very lucky to have
her by my side in this journey.

30:06.181 --> 30:08.308
I'm going to
the three-way knockouts.

30:08.350 --> 30:09.851
Ooh!

30:09.893 --> 30:11.728
Let me remind you, Coaches,
Joslynn is available to steal.

30:11.770 --> 30:13.480
Joslynn, anything you want
to say to your coach?

30:13.521 --> 30:15.982
You've been such
an encouragement to me.

30:16.024 --> 30:17.817
I'm just so thankful
for this opportunity

30:17.859 --> 30:19.486
that I even got to be here.

30:19.527 --> 30:22.280
Give it up one more time
for Joslynn Rose!

30:22.322 --> 30:24.240
Gwen: The fact that
Joslynn is so young

30:24.282 --> 30:26.951
and she can sing the way
she does, so emotionally

30:26.993 --> 30:28.161
and with a lot of dynamic...

30:28.203 --> 30:30.413
Good job, honey.
You did so good.

30:30.455 --> 30:32.749
...she's got a really
bright future.

30:32.791 --> 30:35.669
I think she just wasn't
ready in this moment.

30:35.710 --> 30:36.711
[ Sobs ]

30:36.753 --> 30:38.171
I hate this show.

30:38.213 --> 30:39.923
That sucks.
That stuff is the worst.

30:39.964 --> 30:41.174
Gwen: That's the worst.
Whew!

30:41.216 --> 30:43.176
This year, it's teams of 14,

30:43.218 --> 30:45.387
so there's a lot of competition
for these artists.

30:45.428 --> 30:48.139
But I want the best team
going into the knockouts.

30:48.181 --> 30:51.559
And I think I have my eye
on somebody down the line.

30:51.601 --> 30:54.020
I'm waiting for 'em
to come back out on the stage.

30:54.062 --> 30:55.939
That's who I want to steal.

31:02.696 --> 31:03.863
* This is "The Voice" *

31:03.905 --> 31:06.074
Daly:
Welcome back to "The Voice."

31:06.116 --> 31:08.201
Niall: Reid,
how's it going, buddy?
I'm good.
How are you doing?

31:08.243 --> 31:10.036
How are you, man?
Nice to see you.
It's so nice to see you.

31:10.078 --> 31:12.789
Noah and Reid --
I paired these two guys together

31:12.831 --> 31:16.126
because they both lean down
that folk side of things.

31:16.167 --> 31:18.837
Noah's a smidge more country
than Reid is.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.463
Reid's a bit more folkier,
poppier.

31:20.505 --> 31:22.048
But this felt like
a really good match.

31:22.090 --> 31:23.466
How's things been
since the audition, huh?

31:23.508 --> 31:25.885
Pretty good.
It was nice to go back home,

31:25.927 --> 31:27.220
hang out with the family
for a while.

31:27.262 --> 31:28.722
Played a few gigs,
played some golf.

31:28.763 --> 31:30.223
Did you? Me too.
Oh, yeah.

31:30.265 --> 31:32.225
Yeah, we played
while we were here, too.

31:32.267 --> 31:34.644
At first, I was a little bit
shocked that Noah and I

31:34.686 --> 31:37.063
were paired together,
but it clicked from the start.

31:37.105 --> 31:39.274
We have very similar
personalities

31:39.315 --> 31:41.026
and interests in life.

31:41.067 --> 31:43.278
It's made this whole process
really fun.

31:44.821 --> 31:46.239
Reid's the man.
He's the best.

31:46.281 --> 31:47.907
We kind of just mutually agreed

31:47.949 --> 31:49.492
that we're, like,
best friends now.

31:49.534 --> 31:51.494
And not only that, I mean, I
feel like I'm learning from him.

31:51.536 --> 31:53.288
He's done things
with his music

31:53.329 --> 31:55.915
that I want to do
in the future with mine.

31:55.957 --> 31:58.126
Aah!
Whoa!

31:58.168 --> 32:00.170
Dude. What was that?

32:00.211 --> 32:02.255
[ Inhales sharply ] I was just
working on my vocal warm-ups.

32:02.297 --> 32:05.133
Let's go get you a towel.
Alright.
Yeah, let's do that.

32:06.301 --> 32:07.761
Right, "Lego House."
Yeah.

32:07.802 --> 32:09.387
How do we feel?

32:09.429 --> 32:11.097
I love it.
Noah: When I was first
really learning

32:11.139 --> 32:13.266
how to play guitar,
Ed Sheeran was like, yeah, huge.

32:13.308 --> 32:14.976
Some of the first songs
I learned how to play

32:15.018 --> 32:16.895
on the guitar
were Ed Sheeran songs.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.271
I remember playing
a lot of them

32:18.313 --> 32:20.273
in school talent shows
and stuff as a kid.

32:20.315 --> 32:22.275
I know that 12-year-old me
would be over the moon

32:22.317 --> 32:24.235
to be singing
an Ed Sheeran song on TV.

32:24.277 --> 32:27.447
* I'm gonna pick up
the pieces *

32:27.489 --> 32:29.657
* And build
a Lego house *

32:29.699 --> 32:32.869
I love the rasp that
Noah's got in his voice,

32:32.911 --> 32:35.080
and someone that's got
so much character, too.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.123
He knows where to put
certain notes.

32:37.165 --> 32:40.293
* Don't hold me down *

32:40.335 --> 32:41.836
The way he navigates
his way through a song

32:41.878 --> 32:44.255
is unlike many in
the competition, to be honest.

32:44.297 --> 32:46.841
* More than I can take *

32:46.883 --> 32:48.343
Reid: This song,
it's about life.

32:48.385 --> 32:49.719
You're gonna have
ups and downs.

32:49.761 --> 32:51.805
It seems anything that
I go through in my life,

32:51.846 --> 32:54.057
my wife really supports me.

32:54.099 --> 32:57.018
I met my wife in math class.

32:57.060 --> 32:58.812
We got married
when we were young.

32:58.853 --> 33:01.439
I was 21 years old.

33:01.481 --> 33:05.193
My wife and I moved to Alabama
two years ago

33:05.235 --> 33:07.529
for my wife to go
to physical therapy school,

33:07.570 --> 33:10.323
so it's been a grind
just making music work

33:10.365 --> 33:12.992
because I'm actually
traveling to Nashville

33:13.034 --> 33:14.494
multiple times a week.

33:14.536 --> 33:16.663
But to see her doing well
is really inspiring.

33:16.705 --> 33:18.498
And I'm able to chase
my dream now,

33:18.540 --> 33:22.127
and it's really exciting 'cause
I ended up at "The Voice."

33:22.168 --> 33:25.672
* Get on the road *

33:25.714 --> 33:27.757
* Find someone that loves you
better than I do *
Whoo!

33:27.799 --> 33:30.885
Reid: The blinds,
it was an incredible experience.

33:30.927 --> 33:32.303
I absolutely blacked out.

33:32.345 --> 33:34.347
Your voice is
just so captivating.

33:34.389 --> 33:36.182
You can hear
the storyteller in you.

33:36.224 --> 33:38.685
What excites me the most
about working with Niall

33:38.727 --> 33:40.270
is his songwriting.

33:40.311 --> 33:42.939
Just listening through his new
record really gets me excited,

33:42.981 --> 33:46.568
because a lot of his influences
are important to me as well.

33:46.609 --> 33:49.738
* I'm out of touch,
I'm out of luck *

33:49.779 --> 33:53.074
I love Reid's voice.
It's just so individual.

33:53.116 --> 33:55.160
And I just love
how nice of a guy he is.

33:55.201 --> 33:56.494
I could tell before
I even pressed the button

33:56.536 --> 33:58.371
that this was gonna be
a nice guy.

33:58.413 --> 34:01.207
I really want Reid to lean
into his singer-songwriter side.

34:01.249 --> 34:02.709
It feels like
the right thing to do.

34:02.751 --> 34:09.466
* I think
I love you better now *

34:09.507 --> 34:11.885
Whoo!
Really good.

34:11.926 --> 34:14.387
Reid, you could just sit back
in the groove just a little bit.

34:14.429 --> 34:17.265
Yeah.
I have a few songs where
it's rhythmically like

34:17.307 --> 34:19.851
[vocalizing] and it's very easy
to race ahead.

34:19.893 --> 34:21.644
You've got way more time
than you think you do.

34:21.686 --> 34:23.063
Yes, sir.
Like the way Ed does it,

34:23.104 --> 34:24.522
where he kind of sits back

34:24.564 --> 34:26.232
and it's nearly like
a rap to him.
Yeah.

34:26.274 --> 34:28.318
Niall is pushing me
out of my comfort zone

34:28.360 --> 34:30.528
with this being more
of a heavy pop song,

34:30.570 --> 34:32.697
but it's a great thing to do
as an artist.

34:32.739 --> 34:34.824
Noah, I like hearing
your twang in there.

34:34.866 --> 34:36.910
I think the more of that twang
we can hear, the better.

34:36.951 --> 34:38.328
Yeah, cool.

34:38.370 --> 34:39.788
It is pretty wild
being out here in California.

34:39.829 --> 34:41.873
My hometown
is Richlands, Virginia,

34:41.915 --> 34:43.208
in the Appalachian area.

34:43.249 --> 34:45.293
It's a small town
of about 5,000 people.

34:45.335 --> 34:47.545
I've tried to hide
my Appalachian accent

34:47.587 --> 34:50.006
being here in L.A.,
but people notice when I sing.

34:50.048 --> 34:52.217
The music that I would hear
on the radio as a kid

34:52.258 --> 34:53.593
riding around
with my grandfather

34:53.635 --> 34:55.345
has been
a huge inspiration to me.

34:55.387 --> 34:57.430
The storytelling aspects
of country music,

34:57.472 --> 34:59.099
that falls right in line
with what I'm trying to do.

34:59.140 --> 35:04.270
* I'm damned if I do
and I'm damned if I don't *

35:04.312 --> 35:06.606
Honestly, one of my
favorite types of voices

35:06.648 --> 35:08.108
that you could find
in the Earth.

35:08.149 --> 35:09.734
I love a gravelly growl
like that.

35:09.776 --> 35:11.778
Noah: Niall -- I just think
he has a whole lot to offer me

35:11.820 --> 35:14.197
in terms of vocal technique,
emotion, performance,

35:14.239 --> 35:17.117
stage presence, just everything
that I want to be better at.

35:17.158 --> 35:18.576
Niall: Relax into it.

35:18.618 --> 35:20.537
I feel like you get better
as the song goes on.

35:20.578 --> 35:21.913
Just tell the story
from the start,

35:21.955 --> 35:23.540
and it'll take
some of the shake out of it.

35:23.581 --> 35:24.958
* I'm out of touch *
Who's singing that?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.835
* I'm out of love,
I'll pick you... *

35:26.876 --> 35:29.587
Just kind of make it
just a touch more...

35:29.629 --> 35:31.798
chest up, chest --
you know, back and forth.
Right. Yeah.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.925
You'll have
a touch more control.

35:33.967 --> 35:36.803
* Raging on *

35:36.845 --> 35:39.556
* I'm out of touch,
I'm out of love *

35:39.597 --> 35:41.307
Niall: What this battle
comes down to

35:41.349 --> 35:43.852
is who can relax
into the song the most?

35:43.893 --> 35:45.353
Because it's quite a rappy,

35:45.395 --> 35:47.313
get-ahead-of-yourself type song
if you let it.

35:47.355 --> 35:49.816
So whoever sits back into
the pocket the most

35:49.858 --> 35:52.277
and delivers this perfectly
will win this battle.

35:52.318 --> 35:53.570
Gents,
it's been a pleasure.

35:53.611 --> 35:55.155
Reid: It's been awesome.
Yeah.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.198
Lovely to see you again.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.950
Keep in touch.
You know where I am.

35:58.992 --> 36:01.202
I got you. We're in it
for the long run, boys.

36:01.244 --> 36:02.454
Sounds good.

36:02.495 --> 36:04.748
[ Cheers and applause ]

36:04.789 --> 36:08.168
Two determined singers
enter now from Team Niall.

36:08.209 --> 36:12.005
It's the 20-year-old
from Virginia, Noah Spencer.

36:12.047 --> 36:13.673
[ Cheers and applause ]

36:13.715 --> 36:15.425
Noah: I am nervous
to go against Reid.

36:15.467 --> 36:17.510
I mean, he puts emotion
into every one of the words

36:17.552 --> 36:18.720
that he says,
and you can feel it.

36:18.762 --> 36:20.472
But I really
don't want to lose,

36:20.513 --> 36:22.015
just because I want
to continue to work with Niall.

36:22.057 --> 36:24.142
My plan for winning
this battle is to just

36:24.184 --> 36:26.061
leave it all out there
and do the best that I can.

36:26.102 --> 36:31.524
Daly: And the 27-year-old
from Tennessee, Reid Zingale.

36:31.566 --> 36:34.861
Reid: I do love Noah so much.
I think the world of him.

36:34.903 --> 36:37.530
He's the kind of singer
that completely captivates you

36:37.572 --> 36:39.240
from the start
to the finish of a song,

36:39.282 --> 36:40.658
and that's intimidating.

36:40.700 --> 36:42.535
But I'm here to prove
that this is something

36:42.577 --> 36:44.412
that I can do
for a long time

36:44.454 --> 36:46.289
and I can make
a career out of it.

36:46.331 --> 36:48.458

36:55.548 --> 36:56.883
* This is "The Voice" *

of the battles.

talented coach.

I don't even know
what's happening.
Thank you.

40:13.496 --> 40:15.957
Both of you have strengths
that you showed during

40:15.999 --> 40:18.209
this performance that were
really compelling.

40:18.251 --> 40:20.462
Reid, your voice
is very different

40:20.503 --> 40:23.006
and kind of unexpected
in a lot of ways.

40:23.048 --> 40:25.342
Noah, your voice
is just so super cool.

40:25.383 --> 40:28.053
It just sounds
so interesting,

40:28.094 --> 40:30.096
and the rasp in your voice,
and like,

40:30.138 --> 40:33.099
there's like this softness to it
at the same time.

40:33.141 --> 40:34.851
I think
I would lean toward Noah.

40:34.893 --> 40:35.977
Okay.

Thank you, thank you.

40:37.395 --> 40:39.189
Reid, your voice is just
absolutely beautiful.

40:39.230 --> 40:41.524
Thank you you so much.
I love the quality,
the purity of it.

40:41.566 --> 40:43.401
Noah, yours --
I love the grit.

40:43.443 --> 40:45.945
I love that little growl
you had in there.
Thank you.

40:45.987 --> 40:47.655
You're both great.

40:47.697 --> 40:51.117
Thank you, Coaches.
Alright, Niall.

40:51.159 --> 40:53.578
Tough decision here.
Give us some thoughts.

40:53.620 --> 40:55.246
Reid, your tone
is just so beautiful.

40:55.288 --> 40:56.748
I remember hearing
your first audition

40:56.790 --> 40:58.792
and just wanting to turn.
If you had your eyes closed,

40:58.833 --> 41:01.211
you'd want to open them to see
who this voice is coming out of.

41:01.252 --> 41:04.172
And, Noah, there's something
really intriguing about you.
Thank you.

41:04.214 --> 41:07.550
And I think it's because
you're a touch closed off

41:07.592 --> 41:09.511
and you don't
give it all away.

41:09.552 --> 41:11.179
Like, my favorite
singer-songwriter of all time

41:11.221 --> 41:12.681
is a guy called
Damien Rice.

41:12.722 --> 41:14.641
He's the reason that I basically
picked up a guitar,

41:14.683 --> 41:16.559
and he's probably one of
the most closed-off humans

41:16.601 --> 41:19.479
that there ever was,
but he bleeds emotion.

41:19.521 --> 41:21.648
To be honest, I think
the both of you did a great job.

41:21.690 --> 41:23.233
Niall, the time has come.

41:23.274 --> 41:24.984

what I was gonna do.

Thanks, dude.
Appreciate you.
Niall: So good.

41:44.004 --> 41:46.715
Noah showed me today
that he can sing

41:46.756 --> 41:48.091
pretty much anything.

41:48.133 --> 41:49.634
He would call himself
a country guy.

41:49.676 --> 41:52.012
He stood up today and sang
basically a pop folk song.

Reid, anything you want
to say to Niall?

42:01.563 --> 42:03.356
Thank you so much
for this opportunity.

I've learned so much
over the past few weeks,

and he's got that really clear,
wispy tone.

42:17.871 --> 42:22.334

so much.

I listened to since I was a kid.

said that he loved my voice

What were you up to during
the last couple weeks?

and seeing how everything works.

45:01.868 --> 45:04.454
Coming to blinds,
it just didn't feel real.

45:04.496 --> 45:06.539
But after it all soaked in,

45:06.581 --> 45:09.125
it really just validated
all of my dreams.

When he gave me that hug,
I was just kind of like, "Wow."

it's really happening.

"Do It" by Chloe x Halle.

45:19.260 --> 45:20.470
I think this song is perfect

45:20.512 --> 45:22.222
because they're both
soulful singers,

45:22.263 --> 45:24.891
but I wanted them to have
something a little more playful

45:24.933 --> 45:26.768
than what they did
in the blinds.

45:26.810 --> 45:30.522
* No drama, no baby mamas,
keepin' it cute *

45:30.563 --> 45:33.233
Chloe and Halle,
obviously they're sisters.

45:33.274 --> 45:34.776
They've been singing
together forever,

45:34.818 --> 45:36.569
and they've got
this natural chemistry.

45:36.611 --> 45:38.947
And we don't do a lot of songs
like this on "The Voice."

45:49.708 --> 45:52.544
Two years ago,
I saw John Legend in concert

45:52.585 --> 45:54.671

after that concert,

45:54.713 --> 45:56.423
"I don't know how
it's gonna happen,

45:56.464 --> 45:59.050
but one day I'm going to work
with John Legend."

45:59.092 --> 46:01.428
And here we are,
two years later.

46:01.469 --> 46:04.973
I'm working with him,
and it's unreal.

46:05.015 --> 46:06.766

My boyfriend, Austin, and I have
been together for eight years.

46:14.566 --> 46:16.151
We were
high school sweethearts,

46:16.192 --> 46:18.319
and my boyfriend
is very musical.

46:18.361 --> 46:20.697
He plays the drums, the piano.

46:20.739 --> 46:22.782
He wants to one day move here,

46:22.824 --> 46:25.910
and that's also my dream
to one day end up here in L.A.

46:25.952 --> 46:28.288
permanently,
working as an artist.

46:28.329 --> 46:29.789
Yes, I loved it.

46:29.831 --> 46:31.791
That's the right kind of sauce
to put on it, too.

46:31.833 --> 46:35.879
And I like how you did quite
a few, like, melodic changes

46:35.920 --> 46:38.715
that really fit musically
still, you know.
Thank you.

46:38.757 --> 46:43.303
And, Taylor, be a little more
playful and, like, seductive.

46:43.345 --> 46:44.596
You know what I'm saying?

46:44.637 --> 46:46.639
* I'm on the way *
Right?

46:46.681 --> 46:48.808
You're playing it a little
straight to me right now,

46:48.850 --> 46:50.977
and I want you to, like,
give it more of a vibe

46:51.019 --> 46:53.063
and a seductiveness to it,
okay?
Okay.

46:53.104 --> 46:55.607
* Let you know
when I'm 'bout a mile away *

46:55.648 --> 46:58.151
Azán:
I mean, I honestly feel like
I can't even put it in words

46:58.193 --> 47:02.155
how I'm feeling, because this is
an opportunity of a lifetime.

47:02.197 --> 47:05.158
So, before I started
recording my own music,

47:05.200 --> 47:06.576
I was dancing a lot more,

47:06.618 --> 47:08.620
I was opening up
for different artists.

47:08.661 --> 47:10.205
In high school,
I was a high stepper.

47:10.246 --> 47:12.332
So, a lot of people are
kind of like, "What is that?"

47:12.374 --> 47:15.669
But they're like the girls
that do the halftime shows

47:15.710 --> 47:19.089
that dance,
and we do hip-hop, jazz, modern.

47:19.130 --> 47:20.674
I'm definitely implementing

47:20.715 --> 47:22.926
the dance moves
into my performance.

47:22.967 --> 47:26.012
* That's just
what I do, do, do *
Hey! Hey!

47:26.054 --> 47:29.057
John: Azán is so cool.
She's got great charisma.

47:29.099 --> 47:30.600
I love how she sells a song

47:30.642 --> 47:32.018
and she gets into
the performance.

47:32.060 --> 47:33.978
* I do *

47:34.020 --> 47:36.356
* And that's just
how we do it *

47:36.398 --> 47:39.067
Taylor's voice
is so soulful.

47:39.109 --> 47:42.404
She makes really
beautiful melodic choices.

47:42.445 --> 47:44.197
I really love
her musicianship.

47:44.239 --> 47:47.742
* Oooooh *

47:47.784 --> 47:50.537
Yes! I loved it.
That's a good arrangement.

47:50.578 --> 47:52.956
Y'all did a great job.
It's really working.
Thank you.

47:52.997 --> 47:55.375
And I think once you got into
the groove of the group

47:55.417 --> 47:57.752
you opened up, too.
It was like you had the plan.

47:57.794 --> 48:00.130
Taylor: The notes that he did
give me, I really took to heart.

48:00.171 --> 48:02.590
This is a song where
I've got to really show

48:02.632 --> 48:04.843
a lot of personality
and attitude.

48:04.884 --> 48:07.095
That's something that
I can definitely

48:07.137 --> 48:09.014
build more and grow from.

48:09.055 --> 48:11.433
I want him to see the effort
that I'm putting in

48:11.474 --> 48:14.811
to show him that I'm the one
that he needs to stay.

48:14.853 --> 48:16.896
And y'all really do look
like y'all belong together.

48:16.938 --> 48:19.983
It's the passion twist.
[ Laughter ]

48:20.025 --> 48:21.776
I love that they worked out
their dance moves.

48:21.818 --> 48:23.278
They worked out
a great arrangement.

48:23.319 --> 48:26.072
I'm so excited.
Oh! So excited.
I love it.

48:26.114 --> 48:28.116
I think the winner
of this battle

48:28.158 --> 48:29.451
is gonna be all about style.

48:29.492 --> 48:31.286
It's not just about
hitting the notes.

48:31.327 --> 48:34.748
It's about having the charisma
to sell the story of the song.

48:34.789 --> 48:37.500
So that's what I'm gonna be
looking for in this battle.

48:43.256 --> 48:44.424

That was fantastic!

You were just performing
like you're on tour.

51:30.590 --> 51:33.093
Both: Thank you!
That was incredible,
with the choreography.

51:33.134 --> 51:35.553
Your vocals were
so good together.

51:35.595 --> 51:36.846
Wow!
Whoo!

51:36.888 --> 51:38.932
Good luck, John.
Yeah.

51:38.973 --> 51:41.851
I was just very entertained,
flabbergasted.

51:41.893 --> 51:44.437
Y'all's talent
is off the charts.

You're not gonna
help me decide, Reba?
No way.

51:51.111 --> 51:52.946
I don't know how much more help
I'm gonna be, either.

51:52.987 --> 51:54.864
This is --
This is a hell of a battle.

51:54.906 --> 51:56.991
Taylor, I thought you were
absolutely brilliant.

51:57.033 --> 51:58.743
To be honest,
I didn't hear anything wrong

51:58.785 --> 52:00.829
between the two of you.
I thought it was phenomenal.
Mnh-mnh.

52:00.870 --> 52:03.623
Azán, the stage presence
you've got is spectacular.

52:03.665 --> 52:05.125
You grabbed that song today.

52:05.166 --> 52:07.877
Like, made it your own
and commanded the crowd.

52:07.919 --> 52:10.088
It felt like the real,
real, real deal.

52:10.130 --> 52:13.675
I would personally lean
a little bit more towards Azán,

52:13.717 --> 52:16.845
but Taylor is a super prospect
for this competition also.

52:16.886 --> 52:18.972
I don't know if that helped,
but yeah, Azán for me.

52:19.014 --> 52:21.933
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

52:21.975 --> 52:25.061
Gwen: Azán, you have
a little more stage presence.

52:25.103 --> 52:27.981
You're commanding
a little bit more attention.

52:28.023 --> 52:30.358
You guys are both
so unbelievable.

52:30.400 --> 52:33.903
Taylor's 23, and I'm thinking,
like, when you're singing,

52:33.945 --> 52:35.488
you become this woman.

52:35.530 --> 52:36.948
So I think with that,

52:36.990 --> 52:38.867
I would say that
I'm more impressed with Taylor,

52:38.908 --> 52:40.702
but they're both
equally gifted.

52:40.744 --> 52:42.495
I enjoyed every minute.

52:42.537 --> 52:44.039
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

Thank you, Coaches.

52:46.166 --> 52:48.001
Alright, John,
you got the final decision.

52:48.043 --> 52:49.627
Give us some thoughts
on the battle first.

52:49.669 --> 52:51.796
I had so much fun
watching this.

52:51.838 --> 52:54.841
And I loved that
they worked out steps together,

52:54.883 --> 52:57.385
just really performed together
like they were a group.

52:57.427 --> 53:01.014
It just felt so natural
seeing you all embrace the song.

53:01.056 --> 53:03.767
It's about going out with your
girls and having a good time.

53:03.808 --> 53:06.728
It's interesting because
everyone picked up on Azán

53:06.770 --> 53:10.273
just being such a really
charismatic performer,

53:10.315 --> 53:12.317
'cause I turned for you
pretty quickly in the blinds.

53:12.359 --> 53:16.237
I just remember how magnetic
and energetic you are onstage.

53:16.279 --> 53:18.281
It carries through
every time you perform.

53:18.323 --> 53:21.076
It just feels
like you belong up there.
Wow.

53:21.117 --> 53:24.245
But, Taylor, I feel like
you really came through.

53:24.287 --> 53:26.247
You came out there
and looked confident.

53:26.289 --> 53:28.333
You didn't look like you
were intimidated by this.

53:28.375 --> 53:30.085
You were like,
"I'm supposed to be here,"

53:30.126 --> 53:31.836
and your singing
is just gorgeous.

53:31.878 --> 53:33.463
So both of you
made me so proud.

53:33.505 --> 53:36.466
I was just smiling
the whole time, just so happy.

53:36.508 --> 53:39.886
John, who is the winner
of this battle?

53:39.928 --> 53:42.305
The winner
of this battle...

53:42.347 --> 53:43.431
is Taylor.

53:45.183 --> 53:47.602
Taylor moving on to the
knockouts. Congratulations!

53:47.644 --> 53:49.938
John: Oh, I loved Taylor
and Azán's performance.

53:49.979 --> 53:52.190
They had the moves.
They had the look.

53:52.232 --> 53:53.692
Just everything was right.

53:53.733 --> 53:55.276
So good.
So proud of you.

53:55.318 --> 53:59.072
But Taylor as a vocalist
is just stunning.

53:59.114 --> 54:02.033
I feel so blessed,
and just thank you, God,

54:02.075 --> 54:03.910
for allowing
this opportunity to happen.

54:10.792 --> 54:12.293
Anything you want
to say to John?

54:12.335 --> 54:14.671
Yes. Thank you so much, John,
for all that you have done.

big boy pants on.

on your team?

54:58.173 --> 54:59.507
that that was gonna be
a tough one for John.

to be honest.

58:00.397 --> 58:02.732
* I had a dream *

58:02.774 --> 58:05.193
Alexa and LVNDR --
I paired these two together

58:05.235 --> 58:07.821
because I felt like these
were my two storytellers.

58:07.862 --> 58:09.364
* Not what you'd think *

58:09.406 --> 58:12.534
And Billie Eilish is one
of the best storytellers

58:12.575 --> 58:14.077
of my generation.

58:14.119 --> 58:16.371
* I had a dream *

58:16.413 --> 58:19.499

I wanted *

58:19.541 --> 58:21.376
When you've got
two very different artists...

58:21.418 --> 58:25.046
Yeah.
...genre wise,
it's more about the song.

58:25.088 --> 58:26.673
The emotion is so big.

58:26.715 --> 58:28.717
And that's what both of you
can do very well.
Yeah.

58:28.758 --> 58:30.885
Both of you are
clearly good songwriters.

58:30.927 --> 58:32.679
You can tell
by the way you sing.
Thank you.

58:32.721 --> 58:35.056
It probably actually leans
a little bit more toward you,

58:35.098 --> 58:36.558
like, as a genre.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:36.599 --> 58:39.853
But what Billie is first
is she's a songwriter.

58:39.894 --> 58:42.897
Yeah.
Like, Billie could have been
an artist in the '70s.

58:42.939 --> 58:44.065
This is gonna be
a lot of fun.

58:44.107 --> 58:46.151
* As long as I'm here *

58:46.192 --> 58:47.569
What I loved
about LVNDR today

58:47.610 --> 58:49.738
was she sat right
behind the beat.

58:49.779 --> 58:51.531
She never felt like
she was rushing to anything.

58:51.573 --> 58:54.159
She was doing it her way,
LVNDR style,

58:54.200 --> 58:55.910
and that's what we love
about her.

58:55.952 --> 58:59.414
* Don't wanna lie here *

58:59.456 --> 59:02.000
Alexa, she really wears
her heart on her sleeve.

59:02.042 --> 59:03.543
She could sing anything

59:03.585 --> 59:07.172
and really make it her own
and portray the emotion.

59:07.213 --> 59:10.592
* You wouldn't
wonder why here *

59:10.633 --> 59:14.346
To me, the song
is about insecurities,

59:14.387 --> 59:16.431
and I can relate to that.

59:16.473 --> 59:20.101
* I know when that
hotline bling *

59:20.143 --> 59:21.603
My blind audition,

59:21.644 --> 59:24.647
I would have been happy
with one chair.

59:24.689 --> 59:30.028
For me to actually get
two chair turns was so cool.

59:30.070 --> 59:31.821
For a long time of my life,

59:31.863 --> 59:35.408
I struggled with just not
feeling like I deserved

59:35.450 --> 59:39.204
to be in certain places
with my music.

59:39.245 --> 59:41.289
When I was a kid,
I was very sheltered,

59:41.331 --> 59:43.875
so I didn't get the normal
social situations

59:43.917 --> 59:46.711
that most kids go through
when they grow up.

59:46.753 --> 59:50.799
And even to this day, sometimes
I have a hard time fitting in.

59:50.840 --> 59:52.676
So, to get advice

59:52.717 --> 59:55.762
from one of the best artists
in the industry right now

59:55.804 --> 59:58.139
kind of, like,
freaks me out a little bit.

59:58.181 --> 01:00:03.311
But, you know, at the same time,
it's like I'm meant to be here.

01:00:03.353 --> 01:00:07.107
* They don't deserve you *

01:00:07.148 --> 01:00:09.526
Niall: Ohh!
I like that.

01:00:09.567 --> 01:00:12.070
I think I would connect with
each other earlier in the song.

01:00:12.112 --> 01:00:14.447
Both: Okay.
Just because if you're not
looking at someone,

01:00:14.489 --> 01:00:16.157
you can't see where
you're going timing wise.

01:00:16.199 --> 01:00:18.368
Okay.
And I think what's gonna make
this really special

01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:20.620
is how small you sing
the harmonies.

01:00:20.662 --> 01:00:22.872
Yeah, and don't be afraid
to show off

01:00:22.914 --> 01:00:24.791
more of your personality
individually...

01:00:24.833 --> 01:00:26.209
Okay.
...in your verse parts, too.

01:00:26.251 --> 01:00:27.460
So, this is
the first time

01:00:27.502 --> 01:00:28.837
I've ever played
without an instrument.

01:00:28.878 --> 01:00:30.839

like, doing with myself?

when she's singing.

doing it myself,

01:00:34.134 --> 01:00:36.678
like playing without my guitar,
I'm just kind of like...

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.096
I know, right?
What do I do
with my hands?

01:00:38.138 --> 01:00:39.347
You just
have to just...

01:00:39.389 --> 01:00:41.141
forget that you even
ever played the guitar.

01:00:41.182 --> 01:00:42.642
Alright.
Just forget it.

01:00:42.684 --> 01:00:44.519
You just have to do it, and then
it becomes second nature.

01:00:44.561 --> 01:00:46.563
How do you stay
in the heart of a song

01:00:46.604 --> 01:00:49.024
while there's all these,
like, new things?

01:00:49.065 --> 01:00:52.027
I always try and, like,
create a bubble around myself...

01:00:52.068 --> 01:00:53.695
Okay, yeah.

01:00:53.737 --> 01:00:56.197

people and cameras everywhere.

01:00:56.239 --> 01:00:57.657
Yeah.
Try and not overthink.

01:00:57.699 --> 01:00:59.951
I want nothing more than
to see myself

01:00:59.993 --> 01:01:02.746

were seeing me.

01:01:02.787 --> 01:01:08.585

To have four chairs was like --
It was hard to believe.

01:01:11.713 --> 01:01:15.508
I am at a point in my life
where I'm discovering myself.

01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:21.139
And "The Voice" is helping me
to see that I'm worthy.

01:01:21.181 --> 01:01:23.141
As a songwriter
and as an artist,

01:01:23.183 --> 01:01:27.479
I feel there's deep connection
to the way that Billie writes

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.606
and the way
that I aspire to write.

01:01:29.647 --> 01:01:31.816
It draws back from
that inspiration of the '60s

01:01:31.858 --> 01:01:35.487
and '70s where songwriting
and folk music was alive.

01:01:35.528 --> 01:01:37.322

and it's like,

01:01:37.364 --> 01:01:39.407
oh, now I get to reach
an audience

01:01:39.449 --> 01:01:41.618

to reach before.

it's absolutely perfect.

heard it, I started to cry...

where it's like...

that you see yourself"...

01:06:06.883 --> 01:06:10.637
Wow, you guys, that was,
like, so, so, so pretty.

01:06:10.679 --> 01:06:12.806
I loved every second of that.

01:06:12.847 --> 01:06:15.850
And it's crazy because
you're so, so different.

01:06:15.892 --> 01:06:17.769
It's unbelievable.
I mean, LVNDR,

01:06:17.811 --> 01:06:19.854
you're so stylized,
you know, in your singing.

01:06:19.896 --> 01:06:22.857
You have such a signature sound.
It makes you stand out.

01:06:22.899 --> 01:06:25.819
Alexa, you're from
another era, planet

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:28.947
because I haven't heard
a voice like that

01:06:28.988 --> 01:06:31.533
since I was in,
you know, 1970s,

01:06:31.574 --> 01:06:33.034
like in the back
of the station wagon,

01:06:33.076 --> 01:06:34.577
like, listening
to the radio.

01:06:34.619 --> 01:06:36.037
Wow. Thank you.
Because it's just something

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:38.289
really old-fashioned
about it, in the best way.

01:06:38.331 --> 01:06:40.875
Like classic,
but then so powerful.

01:06:40.917 --> 01:06:43.753
But I mean, LVNDR,
you are stunning.

01:06:43.795 --> 01:06:46.548
That was so beautiful.

01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:49.217
LVNDR, obviously,
I felt like you were

01:06:49.259 --> 01:06:52.512
a bit influenced by Billie
in the way that you sing.

01:06:52.554 --> 01:06:57.142
I just really felt like you
understood what that song is

01:06:57.183 --> 01:06:59.894
and how to sing it
in a really beautiful way.

01:06:59.936 --> 01:07:02.230
Alexa, though,
there was something arresting

01:07:02.272 --> 01:07:06.067
about the way your voice entered
when you took over the verse.

01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:08.445
It felt like your presence
was being announced,

01:07:08.486 --> 01:07:10.155
and that's
what swayed me.

01:07:10.196 --> 01:07:12.657
If I were Niall,
I would pick Alexa.

01:07:12.699 --> 01:07:14.617
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:07:14.659 --> 01:07:16.244
Thank you, Johnny.

01:07:16.286 --> 01:07:17.746
Reba: Great job.

01:07:17.787 --> 01:07:19.456
Thank you.
Absolutely
stunning performance.

01:07:19.497 --> 01:07:24.252
LVNDR, you've got that airy,
real soft, tender voice.

01:07:24.294 --> 01:07:26.755
I was really
drawn to that.
Thank you.

01:07:26.796 --> 01:07:29.799
And then, Alexa,
I like the way you looked at us

01:07:29.841 --> 01:07:31.343
and you looked
at the audience

01:07:31.384 --> 01:07:35.096
and you conveyed that emotion
that you were feeling.

01:07:35.138 --> 01:07:38.433
If I had to make a choice,
I would go with Alexa.

01:07:38.475 --> 01:07:40.310
Daly:
Thank you, Coaches.

01:07:40.352 --> 01:07:42.354
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:07:42.395 --> 01:07:44.898
Alright, Niall, you got
a tough decision here coming up.

01:07:44.939 --> 01:07:46.441
Give us some thoughts
on the battle first.

01:07:46.483 --> 01:07:48.151
Again, another one
of my battle pairings

01:07:48.193 --> 01:07:50.945
where I regret
sticking you together.

01:07:50.987 --> 01:07:54.282
I think both of you
executed it so well.

01:07:54.324 --> 01:07:56.034
There's no doubt about it.
[ Exhales deeply ]

01:07:56.076 --> 01:07:57.786
Neither of you deserve
to go home,

01:07:57.827 --> 01:07:59.788
and this is the one
that got me last night.

01:07:59.829 --> 01:08:01.081
When I'm sat there
watching TV,

01:08:01.122 --> 01:08:02.874
I'm, like,
constantly thinking of this.

01:08:02.916 --> 01:08:04.209
I couldn't even tell you
what I watched.

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:06.670
[ Laughter ]
Going off gut feeling,

01:08:06.711 --> 01:08:08.046
which is what happens
in these battles,

01:08:08.088 --> 01:08:10.590
because if you go in
with preconceptions,

01:08:10.632 --> 01:08:12.133
they always get
canceled out

01:08:12.175 --> 01:08:15.136
and I just sit here mumbling
like I'm doing right now,

01:08:15.178 --> 01:08:16.388
and then waiting
for Carson to go,

01:08:16.429 --> 01:08:18.181
"Niall, who wins the battle?"
[ Laughs ]

01:08:18.223 --> 01:08:20.558
Well, Niall, tough decision
for you here, buddy.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.977
[ Laughter ]

01:08:23.019 --> 01:08:25.647
Unfortunately,
the time has come.

01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:27.357
You've babbled enough.

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:28.775
[ Laughter ]

01:08:28.817 --> 01:08:30.735
Who is the winner
of this battle?

01:08:30.777 --> 01:08:35.240
Gut instinct and feeling.

01:08:35.281 --> 01:08:37.450
The winner of this battle
is Alexa.

01:08:37.492 --> 01:08:39.577
Alexa, congratulations!

01:08:39.619 --> 01:08:41.579
You're moving on
to the knockouts!

01:08:41.621 --> 01:08:44.708
I'm feeling so elated.

01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:45.959
Beautiful.
Thank you.

01:08:46.001 --> 01:08:47.544
You did exactly what
I asked you to do.

01:08:47.585 --> 01:08:48.837
Thank you.
It was so lovely.

01:08:48.878 --> 01:08:50.547
I'm just ready
to keep showing

01:08:50.588 --> 01:08:52.090
more of who I am
to the world.

01:08:52.132 --> 01:08:54.676
Coaches, let me remind you that
LVNDR is available to steal.

01:08:54.718 --> 01:08:56.344
Anything you want
to say to your coach?

01:08:56.386 --> 01:08:59.264
Just meeting all of you guys
has been so cool.

01:08:59.305 --> 01:09:01.933
And just...
thank you so much.

01:09:01.975 --> 01:09:03.643
Thank you.
You're an amazing talent.

01:09:03.685 --> 01:09:06.354
Yes, you are.
Give it up one more time,
everybody, for LVNDR.

01:09:06.396 --> 01:09:08.815
Niall: LVNDR is
an incredible artist,

01:09:08.857 --> 01:09:10.692
but Alexa has
something different.

01:09:10.734 --> 01:09:12.777
She can portray emotion
in a song

01:09:12.819 --> 01:09:14.404
like nobody else
in the competition.

01:09:14.446 --> 01:09:16.865
She literally had tears in her
eyes performing that song today.

01:09:16.906 --> 01:09:18.825
I've got a good feeling
that we're gonna see

01:09:18.867 --> 01:09:20.952
a magical moment from Alexa
in the knockouts.

01:09:20.994 --> 01:09:22.704
Great job. Fantastic.
Thank you so much.

01:09:22.746 --> 01:09:24.330
John: LVNDR...

01:09:24.372 --> 01:09:26.249
I was thinking about stealing
her because she's very good,

01:09:26.291 --> 01:09:28.168
but I just thought
the performance

01:09:28.209 --> 01:09:31.046
didn't have enough of its own
character to it to make me say,

01:09:31.087 --> 01:09:32.714
"Oh, I need this artist
on my team."

01:09:32.756 --> 01:09:34.632
Oh, my God,
Alexa's insane.

01:09:34.674 --> 01:09:37.093
Oh, Alexa, man.
It was so cool.

01:09:37.135 --> 01:09:38.928
Her voice is so pretty.

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:40.889
Yeah, yeah.
Yes.

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:42.640
The more I think about it,
the better she gets.

01:09:42.682 --> 01:09:44.309
Gwen: I think
that Niall has

01:09:44.351 --> 01:09:46.061
some really good people
on his team,

01:09:46.102 --> 01:09:49.981
but my team is
shaping up so well.

01:09:50.023 --> 01:09:52.233
Team Gwen is
one to watch for.

01:09:52.275 --> 01:09:56.237
* I can buy myself
flowers *

01:09:56.279 --> 01:10:00.200
* Write my name
in the sand *

01:10:00.241 --> 01:10:04.120
* Talk to myself
for hours, whoa, oh *

01:10:04.162 --> 01:10:08.249
* Say things
you don't understand *

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:10.543
Gwen: Jenna, I think
you did a great job.

01:10:10.585 --> 01:10:12.295
So animated, so stylized.

01:10:12.337 --> 01:10:15.423
You're only 19, and the fact
that you're already there

01:10:15.465 --> 01:10:16.800
is just so incredible.

01:10:16.841 --> 01:10:18.927
The winner of the battle
is gonna be Jenna.

01:10:18.968 --> 01:10:20.428
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:22.097
Jenna, congratulations!

01:10:22.138 --> 01:10:24.099
Gwen: I had to go with Jenna
because she just has

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:26.226
so much saturated self-identity.

01:10:26.267 --> 01:10:28.269
You did so good.
So good.
Thank you so much.

01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:29.688
I appreciate you so much.
You look gorgeous.

01:10:29.729 --> 01:10:31.189
Thank you!
Oh, my gosh.

01:10:31.231 --> 01:10:32.941
I cannot wait to work
with Jenna in the knockouts.

01:10:32.982 --> 01:10:34.859
I think she has
a lot of potential.

01:10:41.658 --> 01:10:42.659
* This is "The Voice" *

01:10:42.701 --> 01:10:44.160
Daly: Welcome back.

01:10:46.121 --> 01:10:49.332
John: Let's see, who else
do I want to put together?

01:10:49.374 --> 01:10:53.837
Kaylee and Elizabeth are both,
like, super-duper high sopranos.

01:10:53.878 --> 01:10:56.631
Uh-huh.
Kaylee's singing
like Ariana Grande.

01:10:56.673 --> 01:10:59.551
And then Elizabeth was singing
like Hayley from Paramore.

01:10:59.592 --> 01:11:01.469
I feel like they could do,
like, a pop rock,

01:11:01.511 --> 01:11:04.264
maybe like Olivia Rodrigo
or something like that.

01:11:04.305 --> 01:11:05.432
Oh, fun.

01:11:05.473 --> 01:11:07.392
We're gonna be
tapping into our madness.

01:11:07.434 --> 01:11:09.477
And I'm singing this to
the boy that broke my heart.

01:11:09.519 --> 01:11:10.854
Who are you
singing this to?

01:11:10.895 --> 01:11:12.355
Same. All of them.
All of them.

01:11:12.397 --> 01:11:14.065
Every single last one of them.
All of them.

01:11:14.107 --> 01:11:15.358
We're gonna get angry.
We're gonna get angry.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.235
We're gonna get in touch
with these lyrics.

01:11:17.277 --> 01:11:19.529
Um, yes. Yes.
Go on, boxer Kaylee.

01:11:19.571 --> 01:11:21.031
[ Laughing ] Stop!

01:11:21.072 --> 01:11:24.701
I'm paired up with Kaylee,
and she is fantastic.

01:11:24.743 --> 01:11:28.204
She is 17 years old, but she
sings like she's been doing it

01:11:28.246 --> 01:11:30.331
for like 50 years.
She's nuts.

01:11:30.373 --> 01:11:32.959
Elizabeth, how have you been?
What have you been up to?

01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:34.461
I've been doing so well.

01:11:34.502 --> 01:11:37.047
I've been hanging out
with my new bestie, Kaylee.

01:11:37.088 --> 01:11:38.381
Yes!
Thanks for pairing us up.

01:11:38.423 --> 01:11:39.674
John:
Isn't that so cool?

01:11:39.716 --> 01:11:41.384
Some great friendships
start this way.

01:11:41.426 --> 01:11:43.470
Yes.
And you sang Paramore
when you came.

01:11:43.511 --> 01:11:45.722
Yes.
Are they big
influences of yours?

01:11:45.764 --> 01:11:47.182
Massive influence.

01:11:47.223 --> 01:11:51.478
* All I wanted was you *

01:11:51.519 --> 01:11:54.314
The blinds were
incredibly overwhelming,

01:11:54.356 --> 01:11:57.567
but easily was like
the best moment of my life.

01:11:57.609 --> 01:12:00.195
You've got
such a powerful voice.

01:12:00.236 --> 01:12:02.614
I turned for you because
I would love to be your coach.

01:12:02.655 --> 01:12:04.616
When you did that scoop
and then went into the big note,

01:12:04.657 --> 01:12:07.535
I was like, "Okay,
I want Elizabeth on my team."

01:12:07.577 --> 01:12:10.288
This is such
a hard decision.
Come on, Elizabeth.

01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:12.248
I was genuinely, really,
really torn in the moment.

01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:13.875
John.
Yeah!

01:12:13.917 --> 01:12:15.418
But John really made me feel

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.712
like he would really understand
where I'm coming from

01:12:17.754 --> 01:12:20.382
and help me to step
into the artist identity.

01:12:20.423 --> 01:12:21.841
John: What about you, Kaylee?
What kind of stuff

01:12:21.883 --> 01:12:23.510
do you do for fun
back in Hawaii?

01:12:23.551 --> 01:12:26.262
Been going out to the beach,
family time, hiking,

01:12:26.304 --> 01:12:28.014
getting back
into boxing.

01:12:28.056 --> 01:12:29.432
Oh, you box?
Yeah, I box.

01:12:29.474 --> 01:12:31.810
Are you good?
I mean, I gue-- Yeah.

01:12:31.851 --> 01:12:34.729
You're so tiny, I can't see you
boxing anybody.

01:12:34.771 --> 01:12:38.108
**

01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:39.609
Kaylee: Boxing I started
three years ago

01:12:39.651 --> 01:12:42.320
'cause I felt like I needed
to learn self-defense,

01:12:42.362 --> 01:12:46.282
especially being a girl
in this world.

01:12:46.324 --> 01:12:48.785
I practice
two to three times a week

01:12:48.827 --> 01:12:51.621
and I'm not afraid to get hit.
[ Bell dinging ]

01:12:51.663 --> 01:12:54.416
And I feel like I can kind of
relate the boxing to this

01:12:54.457 --> 01:12:56.126
because, like,
the adrenaline rush.

01:12:56.167 --> 01:12:58.128
And I love just, like,
working with other people.

01:12:58.169 --> 01:13:00.005
You're perfectly prepared
for "The Voice."

01:13:00.046 --> 01:13:01.840
Yes, yes, I am.
Yes, I am.

01:13:01.881 --> 01:13:06.136
* Brown guilty eyes
and little white lies *

Singing "traitor"
by Olivia Rodrigo.

01:13:09.347 --> 01:13:11.474
With the emotion
that's in this song,

01:13:11.516 --> 01:13:14.436
I feel like I could kind of
incorporate boxing

01:13:14.477 --> 01:13:17.147
when I'm, like, trying
to release the anger.

01:13:17.188 --> 01:13:19.149
'Cause I've been through
some, like, breakups.

01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:21.276
I've been hurt.
It's not a good feeling.

01:13:21.317 --> 01:13:25.905
* Yeah, you talked to her
when we were together *

01:13:25.947 --> 01:13:29.951
Olivia Rodrigo is definitely one
of my big influences right now.

01:13:29.993 --> 01:13:31.536
She's doing
what I want to do.

01:13:31.578 --> 01:13:34.164
Yes!
She's songwriting,
making a way for herself

01:13:34.205 --> 01:13:36.499
in this, like, pop/punk rock
sort of scene.

01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:39.085
My goal as an artist
is just to be genreless.

01:13:39.127 --> 01:13:42.505
I grew up on
so many different things.

01:13:42.547 --> 01:13:45.759
This is my brother Jason.
Say hi, Jason.
Howdy.

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.469
We're really close.

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:50.013
We grew up and we went through
a lot together, you know,

01:13:50.055 --> 01:13:53.641
dealing with divorced parents
and tough family situations.

01:13:53.683 --> 01:13:56.394
My brother has always been
supportive of my music.

01:13:56.436 --> 01:13:58.646
He loves all of my songs
that I write now.

01:13:58.688 --> 01:14:01.191
If I didn't have him,
this would be a lot more

01:14:01.232 --> 01:14:04.277
of a nerve-racking time
in my life right now.

01:14:04.319 --> 01:14:07.405
* You *

01:14:07.447 --> 01:14:09.282
Hey!

01:14:09.324 --> 01:14:11.117
That's a really cool part
at the end.

01:14:11.159 --> 01:14:12.702
That was dope.
[ Both laugh ]

01:14:12.744 --> 01:14:15.830
Elizabeth, I liked a lot of
the grace notes you were taking.

01:14:15.872 --> 01:14:17.916
Thank you.
And you were playing
with your tone a little bit

01:14:17.957 --> 01:14:20.210
in a way that was
really cool and artsy.
Thank you.

01:14:20.251 --> 01:14:21.586
And then when you got
to the chorus,

01:14:21.628 --> 01:14:23.588
you might have been
too full the whole time,

01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:26.341
and still could have added
a little more art to that,

01:14:26.383 --> 01:14:27.550
too, and a little
more finesse to that.

01:14:27.592 --> 01:14:29.052
No, I love that.
I'm taking a note.

01:14:29.094 --> 01:14:31.346
Kaylee, on that early part
of the song,

01:14:31.388 --> 01:14:33.765
I wouldn't do any runs.
Mm-hmm, okay.

01:14:33.807 --> 01:14:36.393
Because it almost makes the song
sound too fun...

01:14:36.434 --> 01:14:38.103
Right.
...when she's like...

01:14:38.144 --> 01:14:41.147
She's sad.
She's hurting.
Yeah, she's sad
and she's hurt.

01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:43.566
Think about, "How do I convey
this emotion

01:14:43.608 --> 01:14:46.361
to this person
that's hurt me?"
Right.

01:14:46.403 --> 01:14:48.113
I feel very blessed to be able

01:14:48.154 --> 01:14:49.989
to get coached by John Legend.

01:14:50.031 --> 01:14:53.910
* Once there was a way *

01:14:53.952 --> 01:14:59.666
* To get back home *

01:14:59.708 --> 01:15:01.209
Oh, my God!

01:15:01.251 --> 01:15:04.421
Getting a four-chair turn
is unbelievable to me.

01:15:04.462 --> 01:15:07.257
Now I got more to prove to them,
but I'm, like, ready.

01:15:07.298 --> 01:15:08.758
I love a challenge.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.927
I just graduated

01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:13.388
and I didn't know
what I wanted to do for sure.

01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:16.391
I knew I wanted
to take a musical path,

01:15:16.433 --> 01:15:18.435
and I feel like getting
to the knockout rounds

01:15:18.476 --> 01:15:20.437
will just show that
I made the right decision.

01:15:20.478 --> 01:15:23.857
* Yeah, you're still
a traitor *

01:15:23.898 --> 01:15:27.777
Yeah, I would do
* You're still a traitor *

01:15:27.819 --> 01:15:29.904
* You're still a traitor *
With no "yeah."

01:15:29.946 --> 01:15:32.198
And make the "your"
kind of the emphasis.

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.868
* You're still a traitor *

01:15:34.909 --> 01:15:36.286
Something like that.

01:15:36.327 --> 01:15:38.079
* Yeah *

01:15:38.121 --> 01:15:41.541
* You're still
a traitor *

01:15:41.583 --> 01:15:44.627
Kaylee's voice is ridiculous.
Her range is crazy.

01:15:44.669 --> 01:15:47.922
She does whistle notes.
She can sing like Ariana Grande.

01:15:47.964 --> 01:15:50.175
She can do pretty much
anything she wants.

01:15:50.216 --> 01:15:51.885
So the key with her
is just making sure

01:15:51.926 --> 01:15:53.803
she's a great storyteller
at the same time.

01:15:53.845 --> 01:15:56.389
* You said
you were friends *

01:15:56.431 --> 01:15:59.309
Elizabeth, she's kind of like
a little bit rock,

01:15:59.351 --> 01:16:01.019
a little bit punk,
but still pop.

01:16:01.061 --> 01:16:02.979
I love that she has that power
in her voice,

01:16:03.021 --> 01:16:04.522
but also the quirks.

01:16:04.564 --> 01:16:07.108
The quirks are a lot of fun.

01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:10.195
These girls are making it really
difficult. They're both so good.

01:16:10.236 --> 01:16:11.738
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:13.698
I could see a steal coming out
of this battle, for sure.

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:15.742
That was so fun.
Thank you so much.

01:16:15.784 --> 01:16:19.162
I'm truly excited about this.
This might be my favorite one.

01:16:19.204 --> 01:16:20.330
Aww!
We'll see.

01:16:20.372 --> 01:16:22.415
Don't say that.
We'll see.

01:16:29.005 --> 01:16:30.423
* This is "The Voice" *

01:16:30.465 --> 01:16:32.842
Daly: Welcome back to night four
of the battles.

01:16:34.719 --> 01:16:36.346
Man: 90 seconds.
90 seconds out.

01:16:36.388 --> 01:16:37.847
Kaylee:
Elizabeth is a belter.

01:16:37.889 --> 01:16:40.642
Going up against her
will be nerve-racking.

01:16:40.684 --> 01:16:42.686
I've been singing
ever since I was seven

01:16:42.727 --> 01:16:45.730
and I've been working so hard
to get to this moment,

01:16:45.772 --> 01:16:49.859
so having this opportunity
is a blessing.

01:16:49.901 --> 01:16:52.445
Elizabeth: It means everything
for me to be here right now.

01:16:52.487 --> 01:16:54.781
I used to watch this show
with my mom a lot growing up,

01:16:54.823 --> 01:16:58.076
so, like, even just making it
to blinds was awesome.

01:16:58.118 --> 01:16:59.703
But now I want to keep going.

01:16:59.744 --> 01:17:02.247
Kaylee's top trait
is just the way

01:17:02.288 --> 01:17:05.667
that she has no break in her
upper register whatsoever.

01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:08.461
Yes!
It intimidates me
that she was a four-chair turn.

01:17:08.503 --> 01:17:10.505
So I have to be ready.

01:17:10.547 --> 01:17:12.215
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:17:12.257 --> 01:17:13.967
Let the battle begin.

01:17:14.009 --> 01:17:16.219
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:17:16.261 --> 01:17:22.058
**

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:26.563
* Brown guilty eyes
and little white lies *

01:17:26.604 --> 01:17:31.735
* Yeah, I played dumb,
but I always knew *

01:17:31.776 --> 01:17:35.989
* That you talked to her,
maybe did even worse *

01:17:36.031 --> 01:17:40.660
* I kept quiet
so I could keep you *

01:17:40.702 --> 01:17:43.580
* And ain't it funny *

01:17:43.621 --> 01:17:45.832
* How you ran to her *

01:17:45.874 --> 01:17:50.170
* The second that
we called it quits *

01:17:50.211 --> 01:17:52.756
* And ain't it funny *

01:17:52.797 --> 01:17:55.675
* How you said
you were friends *

01:17:55.717 --> 01:18:00.013
* Now it sure as hell
don't look like it *

01:18:00.055 --> 01:18:02.599
* You betrayed me *

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:07.562
* And I know that
you'll never feel sorry *

01:18:07.604 --> 01:18:10.357
* For the way I hurt,
yeah *

01:18:10.398 --> 01:18:12.442
* You talked to her *

01:18:12.484 --> 01:18:14.778
* When we were together *

01:18:14.819 --> 01:18:17.405
* Loved you at your worst *

01:18:17.447 --> 01:18:19.699
* But that didn't matter *

01:18:19.741 --> 01:18:22.118
* It took you two weeks *

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.371
* To go off and date her *

01:18:24.412 --> 01:18:26.706
* Guess you didn't cheat *

01:18:26.748 --> 01:18:30.752
* But you're still
a traitor *

01:18:30.794 --> 01:18:34.214
* Oooh *

01:18:34.255 --> 01:18:36.633
* God, I wish that you had
thought this through *

01:18:36.675 --> 01:18:40.804
* Before I went
and fell in love with you *

01:18:40.845 --> 01:18:43.348
* Ooh *

01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:45.767
* When she's sleeping
in the bed we made *

01:18:45.809 --> 01:18:48.353
* Don't you dare forget
about the way *

01:18:48.395 --> 01:18:51.106
* You betrayed me *

01:18:51.147 --> 01:18:55.610
* And I know that
you'll never feel sorry *

01:18:55.652 --> 01:18:58.405
* For the way I hurt,
yeah *

01:18:58.446 --> 01:19:00.490
* You talked to her *

01:19:00.532 --> 01:19:02.701
* When we were together *

01:19:02.742 --> 01:19:05.328
* You gave me your word *

01:19:05.370 --> 01:19:07.622
* But that didn't matter *

01:19:07.664 --> 01:19:09.833
* It took you two weeks *

01:19:09.874 --> 01:19:12.585

01:19:14.754 --> 01:19:16.464
* But you're still *

01:19:16.506 --> 01:19:21.136
* You're still a traitor *

01:19:21.177 --> 01:19:24.014
* You're *

01:19:24.055 --> 01:19:27.851
* Yeah, you're still
a traitor *

01:19:27.892 --> 01:19:28.935
Wow.

01:19:28.977 --> 01:19:31.688
* Oooooh *

01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:34.482
* God, I wish that you had
thought this through *

* You *

Yeah! So good!

**

01:19:50.999 --> 01:19:52.459
Wow.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:53.960
Yes!
Oh, my God.

01:19:54.002 --> 01:19:57.505
Elizabeth and Kaylee,
that was fantastic.

01:19:57.547 --> 01:20:00.717
Unbelievable
vocal range and power.

01:20:00.759 --> 01:20:04.429
Elizabeth, when you opened your
mouth and hit that big note,

01:20:04.471 --> 01:20:05.722
I-I was just in awe.

01:20:05.764 --> 01:20:06.973
Thank you so much.
Wow.

01:20:07.015 --> 01:20:09.893
And, Kaylee,
your range is incredible.

01:20:09.934 --> 01:20:12.937
Thank you!
Y'all just really did
complement each other.

01:20:12.979 --> 01:20:15.732
Loved the harmonies.
For this performance,

01:20:15.774 --> 01:20:17.400
I think I would
pick Elizabeth.

01:20:17.442 --> 01:20:18.902
Okay.

01:20:18.943 --> 01:20:21.404
Thank you so much.
That was unbelievable.

01:20:21.446 --> 01:20:24.074
That's the best version
of that song I've heard, 100%.

01:20:24.115 --> 01:20:25.742
Kaylee -- 17.

01:20:25.784 --> 01:20:27.285
Yeah.
Please.

01:20:27.327 --> 01:20:28.745
I know. That's crazy.
Insane.

01:20:28.787 --> 01:20:30.580
Niall: That's a ridiculous
talent to have.

01:20:30.622 --> 01:20:32.999
The control
that you have over your runs

01:20:33.041 --> 01:20:35.085
and -- and the range you've got
is just phenomenal.

01:20:35.126 --> 01:20:36.628
And we've seen again

01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:39.005
why that was a four-chair turn
in the first place.

01:20:39.047 --> 01:20:41.758
Elizabeth,
that was a different beast.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.760
Thank you.
Your identity as an artist

01:20:43.802 --> 01:20:47.013
is something
that we don't have a lot of,

01:20:47.055 --> 01:20:49.099
and you stand out
in this competition, for me.

01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:51.768
Wow.
Personally, I would lean
towards Elizabeth myself.

01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:54.270
Mm-hmm.
Thank you so much.

01:20:54.312 --> 01:20:55.939
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:59.067
Elizabeth, it's hard because
you're battling against Kaylee,

01:20:59.109 --> 01:21:01.778
who has one of the most
incredible voices

01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:03.905
I've ever heard.
The control she has

01:21:03.947 --> 01:21:06.908
and the little tricks
that she can do, it's masterful.

01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:10.161
But that shouldn't
at all discount your lane,

01:21:10.203 --> 01:21:12.622
because there's not
a lot of girls that have power

01:21:12.664 --> 01:21:14.582
and that thing
that you have onstage.

01:21:14.624 --> 01:21:18.461
You're very original and rare,
so I don't know how you choose.

01:21:18.503 --> 01:21:20.296
You're both just so gifted.

01:21:20.338 --> 01:21:21.506
Thank you so much.

01:21:21.548 --> 01:21:23.091
Thank you, Coaches.

01:21:23.133 --> 01:21:24.801
Alright, John,
you've got the final say,

01:21:24.843 --> 01:21:26.553
of course, before you
tell us who won.

01:21:26.594 --> 01:21:28.179
Give us some comments
on that.

01:21:28.221 --> 01:21:29.556
John:
It was stunning.

01:21:29.597 --> 01:21:32.976
Both of you were so, like,
interesting and cool.

01:21:33.018 --> 01:21:35.770
Elizabeth, you'll do
interesting note choices

01:21:35.812 --> 01:21:37.856
that I just would have
never thought of.

01:21:37.897 --> 01:21:39.899
You're able to be both
a little quirky,

01:21:39.941 --> 01:21:42.193
but also you can
just flat-out sing, too.

01:21:42.235 --> 01:21:45.488
And it's very exciting
and interesting to watch.

01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:47.574
And then Kaylee,
as a vocalist,

01:21:47.615 --> 01:21:49.492
there's just very few people
on the planet

01:21:49.534 --> 01:21:51.661
that can sing
with the level of ability

01:21:51.703 --> 01:21:53.663
and the level of gift
that you have.

01:21:53.705 --> 01:21:55.832
You're just so polished
at such a young age,

01:21:55.874 --> 01:21:57.709
it's actually stunning
to watch.

01:21:57.751 --> 01:21:59.961
Thank you.
Both of you
are ridiculous.

01:22:00.003 --> 01:22:02.005
I can't believe
I have to make this decision.

01:22:02.047 --> 01:22:04.174

John: Kaylee and Elizabeth --

01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:23.902
one of the best battles
we've seen.

01:22:23.943 --> 01:22:28.239
Kaylee, she's 17, but my God,
she can do anything.

01:22:28.281 --> 01:22:29.824
Crazy range.

01:22:29.866 --> 01:22:31.910
I feel like Kaylee
could win "The Voice."

01:22:31.951 --> 01:22:34.704
Like, she's that good,
and I couldn't send her home.

right now. I'm feeling so happy.

This is tears of joy as well.
Can't believe it.

Elizabeth is available to steal.

01:22:45.298 --> 01:22:47.342
Elizabeth, anything
you want to say to John?

01:22:47.384 --> 01:22:48.593

Daly:
Queen Reba steals Elizabeth!

01:23:21.334 --> 01:23:25.005
Elizabeth was incredible.
I had to use my steal for her.

01:23:25.046 --> 01:23:27.716
This is my dream come true
right here, girl.

01:23:27.757 --> 01:23:29.592
I remembered her
from the blinds,

01:23:29.634 --> 01:23:31.511
and I really wanted her bad.

01:23:31.553 --> 01:23:33.221
She was supposed
to be on my team.

01:23:33.263 --> 01:23:36.975
I loved her range, her tone,
and I think it's very important

01:23:37.017 --> 01:23:38.685
to have someone
who really stands out.

01:23:38.727 --> 01:23:40.228

this whole thing.

she just stole me.

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:45.650
It means everything that I get
to continue this journey,

01:23:45.692 --> 01:23:47.068
especially with Reba.

01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:48.528

got to stay together.

around here with us.

I saw you leaning
over that button.

I saw her hand
right here.
I was right there.

something dramatic, isn't she?
