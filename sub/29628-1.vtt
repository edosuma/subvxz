00:08.175 --> 00:09.800
<i>I just want to be able to go out</i>

00:09.801 --> 00:11.469
<i>and have a nice night for once.
Is that too much to ask?</i>

00:11.470 --> 00:13.137
<i>One thing I fuck up
in the last nine years.</i>

00:13.138 --> 00:14.722
<i>- One thing?
- Eight years in a row...</i>

00:14.723 --> 00:16.224
<i>It's literally the most important things</i>

00:16.225 --> 00:17.725
<i>you have to remember in a relationship.</i>

00:17.726 --> 00:18.727
<i>That's not the right way
to use "literally".</i>

00:18.728 --> 00:20.186
<i>Uh, I know the difference</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:22.104
<i>between literal and figurative
language, Dave!</i>

00:22.105 --> 00:23.690
<i>You get something on me
and never let it go.</i>

00:23.691 --> 00:25.107
<i>Come on!
I knew it was your birthday!</i>

00:25.108 --> 00:27.068
<i>'Cause you saw it on Facebook!</i>

00:27.069 --> 00:28.653
<i>That's how most people
remember birthdays!</i>

00:28.654 --> 00:30.112
<i>I just want
a little bit of respect, Dave.</i>

00:30.113 --> 00:32.113
<i>Why does everything
have to be an argument?</i>

00:32.115 --> 00:34.117
<i>- Why do you think?!
- You're the one raising your voice!</i>

00:34.118 --> 00:36.077
<i>'Cause it's the only way I can be heard!</i>

00:36.078 --> 00:37.746
<i>- You're like a child!
- I'm like a child?</i>

00:37.747 --> 00:38.913
<i>Yeah, you're like a child!</i>

00:38.914 --> 00:41.667
<i>You're the one shouting at me!
You started shouting first!</i>

00:41.668 --> 00:43.751
‐ I knew this was coming.
‐ Not one present!

00:43.752 --> 00:45.671
‐ There's a version of this‐‐
there's a version of this

00:45.672 --> 00:46.922
where we've had
a really lovely time together.

00:46.923 --> 00:48.756
‐ Just buy me a fucking present.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.384
Maybe that would be a nice thing to do.

01:02.354 --> 01:04.188
- ‐ Just because Stevie cooks one meal...
- Yeah?

01:04.188 --> 01:06.358
...doesn't mean suddenly we all
have to know how to wash rice!

01:06.359 --> 01:08.005
‐ What are you fucking
talking about, Dave?!

01:08.006 --> 01:09.652
I'm talking about it's a different thing!

01:09.653 --> 01:12.322
‐ Oh, my God! It's about
being a fucking grown‐up!

01:12.323 --> 01:14.157
‐ I am being a grown‐up!
Have a look!

01:20.122 --> 01:22.081
Just get what I asked you!

01:22.082 --> 01:24.125
‐...and pumpkin activated...
‐ Just get what I asked you!

01:24.126 --> 01:26.128
‐...fucking quinoa‐stuffed...
‐ Not that one! I need this one!

01:26.129 --> 01:27.128
It's pumpkin and red lentil!

01:27.129 --> 01:31.049
I just want to take you home with me.
Yes, I do.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.729
Listen! Dave!

01:43.730 --> 01:45.564
Fucking listen to me!

01:45.565 --> 01:47.420
No! I said no. No!

01:47.421 --> 01:49.275
‐ No! Listen.

01:49.276 --> 01:52.196
Calm down! Calm down! Listen!

01:55.449 --> 01:56.783
‐ Mate, move on. Move on.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.473
Mate, you've got to move on.
Come on. Get a move on.

01:59.474 --> 02:01.162
‐ Pack it up, get out of here.
‐ What are you doing?

02:01.163 --> 02:02.789
‐ I make an effort every day!
‐ Dave... You don't even...

02:02.790 --> 02:04.875
‐ I'm making an effort
right now being here!

02:07.753 --> 02:09.795
I'll get you something next week!

02:09.797 --> 02:11.839
‐ You don't!
You fucking don't, Dave!

02:11.840 --> 02:13.800
‐ Get yourself a present,
wrap it up from me! See if I care!

02:13.801 --> 02:15.760
‐ Oh, my God!

02:49.753 --> 02:51.797
<i>Well, gosh, gee, golly‐o!</i>

02:51.798 --> 02:54.006
<i>I do love a good song, Frogsie!</i>

02:54.007 --> 02:55.759
<i>I love singing so much, Teddy!</i>

02:55.760 --> 02:58.136
<i>And I love singing with you, Frogsie!</i>

02:59.721 --> 03:01.723
‐ Mommy says you're staying with us.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.767
How long will you be here?

03:04.768 --> 03:07.604
‐
Go to school, Felix.

03:07.605 --> 03:09.690
‐ I've been to school.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.358
‐ What time is it?

03:12.359 --> 03:14.110
‐ It's Teddy McGiggle time.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.738
‐ Mc... What?! Where's your mom?

03:16.739 --> 03:17.780
‐ At the shops.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.033
If you're staying,
does that mean we can hang out lots?

03:20.034 --> 03:22.702
‐ No. Make me a coffee.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.225
‐ I can't make coffee.
I'm five.

03:25.226 --> 03:27.749
Do you want to play with my toy tractor?

03:27.750 --> 03:28.791
‐ No.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.837
Look, Uncle David hit Mommy's
booze cabinet pretty hard.

03:31.838 --> 03:33.671
Ohh, fuck!

03:33.672 --> 03:35.694
‐ That's a bad word, Uncle David.

03:35.695 --> 03:37.477
<i>The McGiggle dance!</i>

03:37.478 --> 03:39.261
<i>A‐one, two, three, go!</i>

03:42.764 --> 03:45.309
<i>We're coming down under, kiddlywinks!</i>

03:45.310 --> 03:47.019
‐ What's this, Uncle David?

03:50.355 --> 03:51.815
Pew, pew! Pew! Pew!

03:51.816 --> 03:54.776
‐ Pew! Pew! Pew!

03:54.777 --> 03:57.738
Pew, pew! Pew, pew!
Pew! Pew! Pew!

03:57.739 --> 03:59.739
Pew, pew, pew, pew! Pew, pew!

03:59.740 --> 04:01.095
‐ What do you think you're doing?

04:01.096 --> 04:02.451
Relax. He's really good at it.

04:02.452 --> 04:03.743
Whoa! What are you doing?!

04:03.744 --> 04:04.828
You're not meant to turn it off like that!

04:04.829 --> 04:05.786
You'll damage the hardware!

04:05.787 --> 04:07.455
‐ Don't expose him
to that sort of violence.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.124
‐ It's not real!
‐ That's not the point.

04:09.125 --> 04:11.542
He's five.
What's wrong with you?

04:11.543 --> 04:13.212
Come and help me unpack
the shopping, fluffy duck.

04:13.213 --> 04:14.253
We're having pizza for dinner.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.507
‐ Pizza? Thank fuck! I'm starving!

04:17.089 --> 04:18.466
Oh, fuck off!

04:19.426 --> 04:21.553
Could someone tell me what
the fuck that is meant to be?

04:21.553 --> 04:23.388
Dave!
‐ Mommy, he did it again.

04:23.389 --> 04:24.764
‐ I will kick you out.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.725
I don't care what you're going through.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.895
‐ What is that?
‐ Tofu.

04:29.896 --> 04:30.770
‐ And this?

04:30.771 --> 04:32.773
‐ It's broccoli.
It's a kind of vegetable.

04:32.774 --> 04:33.814
‐ You like eating this?

04:33.815 --> 04:35.776
‐ Yes. And so does my tractor.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.487
‐ Where's the cheese?
‐ I can't have cheese.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.365
‐ You know he can't have dairy.
He's anaphylactic.

04:41.366 --> 04:43.742
‐ I'm allergic to fish, dairy, eggs,

04:43.743 --> 04:45.159
sesame, nuts, and gluten.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.328
‐ No one's allergic to gluten.
It's a fad.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.331
‐ Don't joke, Dave.
It's a life‐threatening condition.

04:49.332 --> 04:51.979
‐ So is what I'm going through.

04:51.980 --> 04:54.627
‐
Oh, Boo‐Boo!

04:54.628 --> 04:56.546
‐ Why did you call him Boo‐Boo?

04:56.547 --> 04:58.423
‐ It's what I used to call your uncle
when he was your age.

04:58.424 --> 04:59.799
‐
Boo‐Boo!

04:59.800 --> 05:01.717
‐ No, see, you don't get to call me that.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.220
You call me Uncle David,
Uncle Dave, D‐Man, or Big D.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.723
I had too much stuff going on
with the band, all right?

05:06.724 --> 05:07.765
I couldn't get tied down.

05:07.766 --> 05:12.061
‐ Miss Caroline plays the ukulele
and we all sing Taylor Swift songs.

05:12.062 --> 05:15.190
Well, you be sure to tell Miss Caroline
that she can go and suck a bag of dicks.

05:15.191 --> 05:16.190
Dave!

05:16.817 --> 05:19.736
‐ Teddy McGiggle says
to sing the bad word song

05:19.737 --> 05:21.780
when you hear a grown‐up say a bad word.

05:21.781 --> 05:24.198
Do you want to hear it?
‐ No.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.785
‐ ♪ Bad word, bad word!
'Cause you said a bad thing ♪

05:26.786 --> 05:28.703
♪ Now we all have to sing ♪

05:28.704 --> 05:30.225
♪ Tra‐la‐la‐la‐la‐la‐la ♪

05:30.226 --> 05:31.747
♪ Tra‐la‐la‐la‐la‐la‐la... ♪

05:31.748 --> 05:34.793
‐ All Sara would ever go on about
was having kids, okay?

05:34.794 --> 05:36.419
That's why we fought all the time.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.547
‐ Dave, there are plenty of things
to be scared of in this world,

05:38.548 --> 05:39.798
but having a kid isn't one of them.

05:39.799 --> 05:41.299
‐ I came out of a test tube.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.800
‐ Yeah, I know you did, Felix.

05:42.801 --> 05:46.763
‐ Dave, there is nothing that says
you have to end up like Dad.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.768
‐ Felix, could you please tell your mom
that I'm now gonna go down to Domino's

05:51.769 --> 05:53.770
and get myself a proper
cheese‐covered pizza,

05:53.771 --> 05:55.146
with a side of gluten?

05:55.147 --> 05:56.731
‐ Mommy, Uncle David‐‐

05:56.732 --> 05:58.065
‐ You don't have to say it, Felix.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.735
Your uncle isn't making
good choices right now.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.279
‐ You know, when you get yourself
a pair of big‐boy pants,

06:02.280 --> 06:04.239
you realize there's more to life
than tractors!

06:04.240 --> 06:06.616
- Fuckin' tractors!
- ‐

06:06.617 --> 06:09.745
‐ Uncle David is so serious,
isn't he, Mommy?

06:09.746 --> 06:11.705
‐ Yes, my little fluffy duck.
He is.

06:11.706 --> 06:13.790
‐ Quack.
‐

06:16.752 --> 06:18.774
So, do you remember where we're up to?

06:18.775 --> 06:20.307
‐ Where they got away from the witches.

06:20.308 --> 06:22.033
‐ That's right.
They're in Norway,

06:22.034 --> 06:23.759
and they're safe at Grandma's house.

06:25.219 --> 06:26.802
"She was wearing a lace dress

06:26.803 --> 06:29.534
"and the lace kept tickling my nose.

06:29.535 --> 06:32.266
"I had to rest my head on my front paws.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.770
"'Have you ever heard my heart
humming away, Grandmama?'

06:34.771 --> 06:36.729
"I asked her.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.772
"'Often, ' she said.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.317
"'I hear it when you're lying
very close to me

06:40.318 --> 06:42.693
"'on the pillow at night.'

06:42.694 --> 06:44.738
"The two of us remained silent
in front of the fire

06:44.739 --> 06:46.739
"for a long time after that,

06:46.740 --> 06:48.742
"thinking about
these wonderful things.

06:49.743 --> 06:53.372
"'My darling, ' she said at last,
are you sure you don't mind

06:53.373 --> 06:55.707
"'being a mouse
for the rest of your life?'

06:55.708 --> 06:58.751
"'I don't mind at all, ' I said.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.796
"'It doesn't matter who you are
or what you look like,

07:00.797 --> 07:02.756
'as long as somebody
loves you.'"

07:17.229 --> 07:19.731
- ‐ Felix, get up! Felix!
- ‐

07:19.732 --> 07:21.275
‐ Get up! I need your help.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.738
So, when you see her,
you breathe as Darth Vader

07:26.739 --> 07:27.780
and then you say...

07:27.781 --> 07:29.073
"Hello, Aunty Sara.

07:29.074 --> 07:31.493
I am Darth Vader.
May the Force be with us."

07:31.494 --> 07:32.535
‐ Do it properly, Felix.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.079
When the mask is on,
you remain in character.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.746
"Hello, Aunty Sara.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.541
I am Darth Vader.
May the Force be with us."

07:38.542 --> 07:41.753
‐ Yeah! Daniel Day‐Lewis just
came everywhere in his pants!

07:41.754 --> 07:44.255
Okay. Now, can you hold up the sign?

07:44.256 --> 07:46.758
I'll come in and take care of the rest.

07:46.759 --> 07:47.758
‐ Yes, Uncle David.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.762
I mean...
...yes, Uncle David.

07:50.763 --> 07:51.763
‐ All right.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.933
Do it, Darth.

07:57.770 --> 07:59.646
What...?

07:59.647 --> 08:01.523
Aunty Sara.

08:01.524 --> 08:02.648
‐ Felix?!

08:02.649 --> 08:04.734
‐ I am Darth Vader.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.486
‐ Felix, what are you doing here?

08:06.487 --> 08:08.362
‐ What? No!

08:08.363 --> 08:10.741
What the fuck are you doing?!
‐ I live here!

08:10.742 --> 08:12.743
‐ Yeah, well...
who the fuck is that?!

08:12.744 --> 08:14.744
‐ Rory.
‐ That's Rory from work.

08:14.745 --> 08:17.247
‐ Well, do me a favor and get Rory
from work out of your vagina!

08:17.248 --> 08:19.124
‐ Don't go anywhere, Rory.
‐ Is this Dave?

08:19.125 --> 08:20.791
‐ Yeah, hi, Rory. I'm Dave.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.877
I'm Sara's boyfriend
of nine fucking years.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.546
‐ Can you watch your language
around the kid, please?

08:24.547 --> 08:26.798
I am not a kid.
I am Darth Vader.

08:26.799 --> 08:28.717
May the Force be with us.

08:30.219 --> 08:31.220
Oh, yeah.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.639
Yeah, you fucked up, didn't you, Sara?

08:33.640 --> 08:34.931
Because I was gonna marry you.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.767
I was possibly gonna give you a baby.

08:36.768 --> 08:38.726
I even made this engagement ring

08:38.727 --> 08:40.479
out of a pipe‐cleaner
I found under Felix's bed.

08:40.480 --> 08:41.770
‐ No, you do this.

08:41.772 --> 08:44.733
You say one thing.
You never come through.

08:44.734 --> 08:46.776
‐ Hello? I was just about to!

08:46.777 --> 08:49.738
‐ I don't mean marriage and a baby, Dave!

08:49.739 --> 08:51.280
I needed you to love me.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.533
And you're incapable of loving
anyone but yourself.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.911
‐ At least I'm not stuffing
real estate agent dick in me

08:55.912 --> 08:56.744
the first chance I get!

08:56.745 --> 08:58.413
That's enough.
‐ Oh, what are you gonna do?!

08:58.414 --> 09:00.915
‐ You need to watch your language!

09:00.916 --> 09:02.793
‐ You need to stop having sex
in front of kids!

09:02.794 --> 09:03.835
‐ Don't talk to Rory like that.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.796
Rory is more in touch
with his emotional self

09:05.797 --> 09:06.921
than you'll ever be.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.758
‐ The only thing Rory is in touch
with is your slutty vagina!

09:09.759 --> 09:11.217
‐ Not cool.
‐ Yeah?

09:11.218 --> 09:12.761
"Not cool" this, motherfuck...

09:12.762 --> 09:13.929
Arggh! Jesus!

09:13.930 --> 09:15.096
Arggh! Arggh!

09:15.097 --> 09:16.640
- Oh, God! Fuck!
- That's it.

09:16.641 --> 09:17.765
- Calm down!
- Yuck!

09:17.766 --> 09:18.808
Your dick's on my arm!
Your sweaty dick!

09:18.809 --> 09:20.768
- It's disrespectful!
- Shit! No, shit! Okay!

09:20.769 --> 09:22.770
- Come on, easy, buddy!
- Are you gonna behave yourself?

09:22.771 --> 09:24.773
- There's a kid here, man! Ohh!
- Are we good now?

09:24.774 --> 09:26.733
- Yes?
- Arggh! Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.778
I'm sorry I had to resort to violence.

09:29.779 --> 09:30.820
Fucking Rory!

09:30.821 --> 09:32.780
‐ Violence is never the answer.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.784
If you only knew
the power of the Dark Side.

09:35.785 --> 09:36.784
Fucking...

09:36.785 --> 09:39.705
I gave you the best years of my life!

09:40.706 --> 09:42.749
You saw how much bush was thrown
at me when I was in a band.

09:42.750 --> 09:43.791
‐ That was 10 years ago!

09:43.792 --> 09:46.294
Stop going on about the band.
It's pathetic.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.797
‐ Yeah, well, I never screwed anyone else.

09:48.798 --> 09:50.757
I chose to be with you.

09:51.717 --> 09:54.720
‐ There is a big difference
between being with someone

09:54.721 --> 09:56.722
and being there <i>for</i> someone, Dave.

09:56.723 --> 09:57.722
Mmm.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.766
‐ I hope you grow up enough
one day to realize that.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.768
‐ I don't need to do that! You do!

10:02.644 --> 10:04.730
Fucking idiots!

10:11.028 --> 10:13.071
Don't ever expect to see me
back here again!

10:18.702 --> 10:21.747
- Felix?
- I am not Felix. I am Darth Vader.

10:21.748 --> 10:23.269
Darth Vader, now!

10:28.545 --> 10:29.838
Oh, I don't know.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.466
Mommy!
‐

10:33.467 --> 10:35.761
I've been trying to call you.
Where the hell have you been?

10:35.762 --> 10:38.721
Uncle David took me
to see Aunty Sara.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.766
‐ Yeah, and guess what Aunty Sara
was doing when we got there?

10:40.767 --> 10:42.893
Having sex with a real estate agent.

10:42.894 --> 10:45.019
‐ Hang on. What?
‐ Yeah, I know!

10:45.020 --> 10:47.648
‐ You woke my son up so he could
go see two people having sex?

10:47.649 --> 10:49.315
‐ No, not specifically.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.777
‐ The naked man punched
Uncle Dave on the nose

10:51.778 --> 10:54.696
'cause Aunty Sara has a slutty vagina.

10:54.697 --> 10:55.780
‐ I don't believe this.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.740
‐ I know. It's unbelievable!

10:57.741 --> 10:59.033
I mean, how could she do this to me?

10:59.034 --> 11:02.746
‐ If you can't understand
how incredibly inappropriate it is

11:02.747 --> 11:04.373
to take your nephew out
in the middle of the night,

11:04.374 --> 11:05.623
then you can find
somewhere else to stay.

11:05.624 --> 11:08.377
‐ What are you talking about?
He had a great time!

11:08.378 --> 11:09.836
Look, he's Darth Vader!

11:09.837 --> 11:11.192
‐ I am your father, Mommy.

11:11.193 --> 11:12.547
‐ See? He's really good at it.

11:12.548 --> 11:15.759
‐ It's late.
I have a double shift tomorrow.

11:16.635 --> 11:18.470
Get out of my house.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.393
‐ What, are you crying now?

11:26.520 --> 11:28.480
‐ Mommy, you said it's good to cry.

11:31.942 --> 11:35.612
‐ Why can't Uncle David
stay on the couch?

11:39.366 --> 11:41.994
‐ Look, if you're gonna stay here,
then you have to start contributing.

11:41.995 --> 11:42.994
‐ Yeah.

11:42.995 --> 11:44.954
‐ Just... put him to bed now.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.956
And you can take him
to school tomorrow.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.042
‐ Can we play the shooty game,
Uncle David?

11:50.419 --> 11:52.212
‐ I don't want us
to get in trouble, Felix.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.007
We'll have to play it with the sound off.

11:56.008 --> 11:59.136
I need to get to class
early for Miss Caroline.

11:59.137 --> 12:00.825
It's my turn to feed Neville.

12:00.826 --> 12:02.670
‐ Is Neville special‐needs?

12:02.671 --> 12:04.515
‐ Neville's the class guinea pig.

12:04.516 --> 12:07.352
‐ Hey, Felix!
What's for lunch today?

12:07.353 --> 12:09.312
‐ That's Max and Ashton.

12:09.313 --> 12:13.317
They think I'm not strong
because of what Mommy packs me for food.

12:13.318 --> 12:14.984
‐ What fucking douchebags!

12:14.985 --> 12:17.863
Max looks like he could use
a few more tofu pizzas.

12:17.864 --> 12:19.156
Max was the fat one, yeah?

12:19.157 --> 12:20.448
‐ What's a douchebag?

12:20.449 --> 12:23.911
‐ It's a small bag chicks use
to irrigate their vaginas.

12:23.912 --> 12:27.538
‐ I hope you've got yummy
broccoli today, Felix!

12:27.539 --> 12:30.584
‐ Was that retarded kid using
irony to make fun of you?

12:30.585 --> 12:32.376
‐ Mickey has spina bifida.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.046
You love broccoli!
You love broccoli!

12:34.047 --> 12:35.379
‐ Hi, Felix!

12:35.380 --> 12:37.132
‐ Come on, this way!
‐ Okay!

12:37.133 --> 12:38.341
‐ Felix!

12:38.342 --> 12:40.636
Look at you slaying puss
in the playground, huh?

12:40.637 --> 12:42.678
‐ Beth is my girlfriend.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.347
- ‐ Yeah, dog!
- ‐

12:44.348 --> 12:46.224
Treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen.

12:46.225 --> 12:48.100
Good morning, Vivienne.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.395
Fuck me! Who is that?

12:51.271 --> 12:52.564
‐ Yes!

12:54.316 --> 12:57.360
And... yes! Nice!

12:57.361 --> 12:59.071
‐ That's Miss Caroline.

12:59.072 --> 13:01.322
‐ Jesus!

13:01.323 --> 13:03.282
‐ Felix. Lucky last.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.328
‐ Sorry, Miss Caroline.
I can still feed Neville.

13:06.329 --> 13:08.330
- ‐ Max has already fed him.
- Aww!

13:08.331 --> 13:09.622
Ooh! Jeez.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.183
Neville will be lucky to have
anything left with that kid around.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.003
‐ Uh... quickly,
put your bags on your hook

13:15.004 --> 13:16.504
and unpack crunch‐and‐sip.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.674
Come on, mate.
I'll give you a hand with that. Come on.

13:18.675 --> 13:20.008
‐ Hey, hey.

13:20.009 --> 13:21.342
Thank you.

13:21.343 --> 13:22.845
‐ I'm Dave. I'm Felix's uncle.

13:22.846 --> 13:24.096
‐ Oh. Audrey.

13:24.097 --> 13:26.305
Oh! Oh.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.307
‐ Oh, Miss Caroline, jeez.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.497
You are just a beacon of positivity
in my little nephew's life.

13:30.498 --> 13:32.688
‐
‐ He talks about you all the time.

13:32.689 --> 13:36.316
Apparently you slay Tay‐Tay
on the ukulay‐lay?

13:36.317 --> 13:37.692
‐
Oh! I don't know about that.

13:37.693 --> 13:40.904
‐ His mom's going through a weird
breakdowny thing at the moment.

13:40.905 --> 13:42.635
‐ Oh, no. Really?

13:42.636 --> 13:44.365
‐ Yeah. It's bad.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.618
‐ I had no idea.
‐ Yeah.

13:46.619 --> 13:47.910
‐ I hope Tess is okay.

13:47.911 --> 13:51.373
‐ Well, thankfully for everyone,
Uncle David is here to help.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.083
‐ Oh, dear. He's asleep.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.377
Yeah, I mean,
what's going on with his mom

13:55.378 --> 13:56.795
might be affecting his rhythms.

13:56.796 --> 13:58.379
‐ Don't worry.

13:58.380 --> 14:01.175
I'll give him some
special attention today.

14:01.176 --> 14:02.383
‐ Lucky boy.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.343
Felix doesn't even have a dad!
What a loser!

14:04.344 --> 14:06.388
‐ You know, I don't really
think of him as a nephew.

14:06.389 --> 14:08.390
I think of him as a friend.

14:08.391 --> 14:10.391
My best friend. I love kids.

14:10.392 --> 14:13.312
‐
‐ Ooh! What's wrong?

14:13.313 --> 14:14.395
‐ What happened?

14:14.396 --> 14:16.356
‐ Someone hit me with the door!

14:16.357 --> 14:18.337
‐ Let me see. Let me see.

14:18.338 --> 14:20.318
‐ Oh, no!
‐ You are fine.

14:20.319 --> 14:22.341
Okay, quickly, sit back down,
so we can get started.

14:22.342 --> 14:24.364
‐
‐ Brave little man, isn't he?

14:24.365 --> 14:26.073
‐ Nice to meet you, David.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.805
‐ It is.
It's so nice to meet you, yeah.

14:28.806 --> 14:31.538
Guess I'll see you later.
‐ Yeah. Mm‐hm.

14:31.539 --> 14:32.852
‐ See you, Felix.
Love you, mate.

14:32.853 --> 14:34.166
- Felix!
- ‐

14:34.167 --> 14:36.335
‐ Love you, matey. See you.

14:36.336 --> 14:37.793
Bye. Have fun.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.921
‐ One, two, three! Eyes on me!

14:39.922 --> 14:42.049
One, two! Eyes on you!

14:42.050 --> 14:44.342
‐ Okay. It's time to...

14:48.848 --> 14:53.351

15:05.365 --> 15:07.281
‐ Oh.

15:07.282 --> 15:08.825
‐ Hello, David.
‐ Hey.

15:08.826 --> 15:10.368
‐ Y‐you can call me Audrey.

15:10.369 --> 15:12.329
‐ Didn't think I was gonna
make it in time for pick‐up.

15:12.330 --> 15:14.372
I had this crazy rehearsal.

15:14.373 --> 15:17.251
‐ I'm afraid he had
a really rough day today.

15:17.252 --> 15:20.044
‐ Who did?
‐ Felix.

15:20.045 --> 15:23.340
‐ Well, it's a good thing my band's
finished rehearsing for the day.

15:23.341 --> 15:24.340
That's my band.

15:24.341 --> 15:27.302
‐ "God's Sledgehammer"?
‐ That's right.

15:27.303 --> 15:28.386
‐ Is that a Christian band?

15:28.387 --> 15:31.974
‐ No. It's more of a stadium
rock‐slash‐death metal band.

15:31.975 --> 15:35.142
‐ Oh. 'Cause I'm a Christian, so...

15:35.143 --> 15:37.980
‐ It is a Christian band.
I'm a Christian myself, actually.

15:37.981 --> 15:40.314
Audrey?
‐ Oh, hey, Charlotte!

15:40.315 --> 15:42.359
‐ Um, Beth's older brother is really sick.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.318
‐ Oh, no!
‐ It's gastro.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.363
But I'm afraid I won't be able
to chaperone the excursion tomorrow.

15:46.364 --> 15:48.322
‐ Oh. Of course.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.951
A lot of my class is off sick
with gastro as well.

15:50.952 --> 15:52.285
‐ I hope I'm not leaving you in the lurch.

15:52.286 --> 15:53.620
Do you think you'll be able
to find someone else?

15:53.621 --> 15:56.164
‐ Hey! That's me!
I'm someone else!

15:57.291 --> 15:58.651
Where are we going, Miss Caroline?

16:02.087 --> 16:03.921
‐ Oh, the Force isn't working!

16:03.922 --> 16:05.924
‐ Okay, so, we take it out of this...

16:05.925 --> 16:07.008
‐ Mm‐hmm.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.969
‐...then you take
the blue safety cap off

16:08.970 --> 16:10.344
and you push the other end in here.

16:10.345 --> 16:13.724
So, it's "blue in the sky,
orange in the thigh."

16:13.725 --> 16:15.308
‐ Orange in the thigh!

16:15.309 --> 16:17.351
‐ Yeah, I'm serious.
"Blue in the sky" ‐‐

16:17.352 --> 16:21.315
‐ "Orange in the thigh."
I've got it. Don't worry. He'll be fine.

16:21.316 --> 16:23.317
Actually looking forward
to spending some quality time

16:23.318 --> 16:24.650
with my little Lord Vader.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.903
‐ Can I bring this tomorrow, Uncle David?

16:26.904 --> 16:29.323
‐ And that's the only reason why you
want to go on this excursion tomorrow?

16:29.324 --> 16:30.845
‐ Yeah. What other reason would there be?

16:30.846 --> 16:32.367
‐ The one that teaches his kindy class.

16:32.368 --> 16:33.826
‐ Miss Caroline? Come on.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.246
‐ Every dad has tried
to make a pass at her.

16:36.247 --> 16:37.330
‐ Well, she's a Christian.

16:37.331 --> 16:39.541
I'm in a stadium rock‐
slash‐death metal band.

16:39.542 --> 16:40.208
How's that gonna work?

16:40.209 --> 16:42.335
‐ Mommy, I nearly had it!

16:42.336 --> 16:43.377
‐ I'm just trying to understand

16:43.378 --> 16:45.380
why you would so readily
volunteer for something

16:45.381 --> 16:46.756
that sounds like your worst nightmare.

16:46.757 --> 16:49.259
‐ Maybe it's because
I'm actually a good person.

16:49.260 --> 16:51.470
God, is that such a crazy idea?

16:56.016 --> 16:58.352

17:53.283 --> 17:56.284
Good job, guys!

17:56.285 --> 17:58.120
‐ Hey, how long till we get going again?

17:58.121 --> 17:59.370
‐ I'm still working on it!

17:59.371 --> 18:02.374
- ‐ Sing "Shake It Off" again!
- Yay!

18:02.375 --> 18:04.834
‐ No! Sing something else!

18:04.835 --> 18:08.755
‐ I think we've all had enough
of Taylor Swift right now, guys.

18:08.756 --> 18:11.383
‐ Can you sing another song,
Miss Caroline?

18:11.384 --> 18:13.342
‐ Well, actually,

18:13.343 --> 18:17.306
there is somebody on this bus
who is a professional singer.

18:17.307 --> 18:20.350
Who knows what the word
'professional' means?

18:20.351 --> 18:21.350
Beth?

18:21.351 --> 18:24.354
‐ It means it's your proper job
and you get paid money.

18:24.355 --> 18:26.314
Very good, Beth!

18:26.315 --> 18:29.443
You become a professional when
you're so good at something

18:29.444 --> 18:31.319
that you get paid to do it.

18:31.320 --> 18:34.364
I am a professional kindergarten teacher.

18:34.365 --> 18:37.617
And David is a professional singer.

18:37.618 --> 18:40.328
Isn't that right, David?
‐ Uh... that's correct.

18:40.329 --> 18:43.415
Yes, I am a professional
singer, songwriter, guitarist.

18:43.416 --> 18:46.667
‐ Maybe if we all nicely ask David,

18:46.668 --> 18:49.171
he'll come to the front
of the bus and sing us all a song.

18:49.172 --> 18:51.131
What do you think, guys? Yes!

18:51.132 --> 18:52.862
Please? Please?

18:52.863 --> 18:54.592
Louder! Louder!

18:54.593 --> 18:57.095
No, no, no. I'm not prepared.
‐ Come on!

18:57.096 --> 18:58.701
‐ Okay, then. All right.

18:58.702 --> 19:00.307
‐
‐ One song.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.894
‐ Now, sit down and be quiet
so he can play.

19:06.104 --> 19:10.275
‐
Um, hi, guys. Um...

19:10.276 --> 19:12.985
My name's David.
Uh, I'm Felix's uncle.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.322
And I'm also the lead
singer‐slash‐frontman

19:15.323 --> 19:17.865
of my band, God's Sledgehammer.

19:17.866 --> 19:21.578
Oh, and let's not forget
what Leviticus teaches us.

19:21.579 --> 19:24.289
If anyone curses their mother
or their father,

19:24.290 --> 19:25.998
they must be put to death.

19:25.999 --> 19:29.294
That's in the Bible.
That's actually there. God wrote that.

19:29.295 --> 19:32.339
Um, this is one of my slower ditties.

19:32.340 --> 19:35.299
Um... a ballad, if you will.

for everyone, you know?

20:29.189 --> 20:30.439
‐ Yeah, mmm.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.526
- ‐ Bus is fixed.
- Oh!

20:34.527 --> 20:36.319
‐ Next stop, Pleasant Valley!

20:36.320 --> 20:38.363
- ‐ Oh! Thank God! Yay!
- ‐

20:39.281 --> 20:40.824
‐ Clap for David!

20:53.504 --> 20:55.546
- Section 19 clear.
<i>- Section 19.</i>

20:55.547 --> 20:57.924
What's the point
in flying 17 hours on a plane

20:57.925 --> 21:00.302
to work in a country
you're not even allowed to see?

21:00.303 --> 21:02.054
- ‐ Section 12 clear.
<i>- Section 12.</i>

21:02.055 --> 21:03.304
‐ This country's insane.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.015
Do you realize how many animals
they have here

21:05.016 --> 21:06.162
that can kill you?

21:06.163 --> 21:07.308
Listen to this.

21:07.309 --> 21:10.354
"The funnel‐web spider is
the world's nastiest arachnid.

21:10.355 --> 21:12.981
"The venom from this hairy
spider's massive fangs

21:12.982 --> 21:15.608
"attacks a person's nervous
system, leading to death.

21:15.609 --> 21:18.320
The red‐bellied black snake
can grow up to seven feet long."

21:18.321 --> 21:19.362
Section 15 clear.

21:19.363 --> 21:22.115
‐ "The venom from its bite
can cause skin cells to decay,

21:22.116 --> 21:24.200
"along with kidney failure,
leading to death.

21:24.201 --> 21:27.078
"There is no known anti‐venom
for the box jellyfish,

21:27.079 --> 21:29.957
"which is present throughout
coastal waters of Australia.

21:29.958 --> 21:31.958
"The sting instantly leads to necrosis

21:31.959 --> 21:34.585
and random muscle spasms,
and finally, cardiac arrest."

21:34.586 --> 21:38.340
Still, if I get flown back home
without seeing a koala bear,

21:38.341 --> 21:39.716
I'm gonna be pretty upset.

21:47.432 --> 21:49.393
Jesus. One of them's free.

21:51.812 --> 21:55.315
‐ Back away from the body

What the fuck?! What the fuck?!

22:38.984 --> 22:41.653
Get off! Get off!

22:41.654 --> 22:44.323

22:51.414 --> 22:53.832
‐ Minigolf. Minigolf.

22:53.833 --> 22:55.291
‐ This is not the petting zoo.

22:55.292 --> 22:57.836
This is a US military facility.
Do you understand me?

22:57.837 --> 23:01.339
‐ P.
- <i>Full code red.</i>

23:01.340 --> 23:04.301
<i>I repeat, this is a full code red alert.</i>

23:04.302 --> 23:05.676
‐ Shit!

23:05.677 --> 23:09.306
Jerry! Open the gate!
Open the gate!

23:09.307 --> 23:11.182
Open the goddamn gate!

23:11.183 --> 23:13.894
Close the gate! Close the gate!

23:47.511 --> 23:50.305
And our first rule is be safe.

23:50.306 --> 23:51.347
Which means remember the dangers

23:51.348 --> 23:53.392
of touching and tasting things
we don't recognize.

23:53.393 --> 23:55.309
Our rhyme...

23:55.310 --> 23:58.939
We can see, we can smell,
we can hear...

23:58.940 --> 24:00.606
Oh, my gosh! Uncle Dave!

24:00.607 --> 24:03.610
It's Teddy McGiggle!
It's Teddy McGiggle!

24:03.611 --> 24:06.321
‐ What? Oh, my God!

24:11.326 --> 24:14.287
‐ Hi‐ho, kiddlywinks!

24:14.288 --> 24:16.664
Hi‐ho, Teddy!

24:16.665 --> 24:18.917
‐ Hi‐ho, Teddy!

24:18.918 --> 24:21.169
‐ Hi‐ho, Frogsie!

24:21.170 --> 24:26.008
Well, aren't we having a super fun time
on our trip down under?!

24:26.009 --> 24:29.657
We swam with the fish
in the Great Barrier Reef!

24:29.658 --> 24:33.307
We've climbed to the top
of the Harbour Bridge!

24:33.308 --> 24:34.515
And today‐‐

24:34.516 --> 24:38.019
today, we are visiting
the Pleasant Valley Farm

24:38.020 --> 24:41.690
to meet and learn about all
the cute Australian animals!

24:41.691 --> 24:44.193
‐ I want a cuddle from a koala!

24:44.194 --> 24:46.527
‐ I bet you do, Frogsie!

24:46.528 --> 24:48.154
Wow‐ee!

24:48.155 --> 24:52.034
Look at the big crowd
that's come out here to say hello to us.

24:52.035 --> 24:53.993
And hello to you!

24:53.994 --> 24:57.456
What's your name,
you big bundle of sunshine?

24:57.457 --> 24:59.165
Come on over here.

24:59.166 --> 25:03.670
Why don't you guys let the beautiful
yellow lady come on through?

25:03.671 --> 25:05.338
What's your name, little lady?

25:05.339 --> 25:07.841
‐ Miss Caroline.
Oh, but my friends call me Audrey.

25:07.842 --> 25:10.051
My kids call Miss Caroline.

25:10.052 --> 25:13.346
Not my <i>kids</i> kids, my students.
They call me Miss Caroline.

25:13.347 --> 25:17.351
‐ Well, that is a beautiful origin story
if I've ever heard one.

25:17.352 --> 25:20.979
All I know is, your kiddlywinks
sure are lucky

25:20.980 --> 25:24.441
to have a teacher as pretty
as you, Miss Caroline!

25:24.442 --> 25:27.903
I want to give Miss Caroline a cuddle!

25:29.321 --> 25:31.614
‐ I bet you do, Frogsie!

25:31.615 --> 25:33.534
What do you guys say
we do the McGiggle dance?

25:33.535 --> 25:34.951
Yeah!

25:34.952 --> 25:37.538
‐ What do you say we do
the McGiggle dance

25:37.539 --> 25:40.374
to get this party started?!

25:44.211 --> 25:46.525
Excellent job, everybody.

25:48.841 --> 25:51.092
Settle down there, kiddlywinks!

25:51.093 --> 25:54.179
There's more than enough Teddy
to go around!

28:16.447 --> 28:19.031
She's going to take us on a special ride.

28:19.032 --> 28:22.744
And then when we get back to the farm,
there'll be a surprise waiting for us!

28:22.745 --> 28:25.706
‐ Is it putt‐putt golf!
Are we gonna play putt‐putt golf?!

28:25.707 --> 28:27.457
I said it was a surprise.

28:27.458 --> 28:29.208
I'm going to count backwards from 10.

‐ David, just call me Audrey‐‐ eight!

28:36.593 --> 28:38.552
Yeah, I feel like
I haven't been helping enough.

28:38.553 --> 28:40.762
- Seven!
- Can I get more involved?

28:40.763 --> 28:42.973
‐ Six! Yeah, you can help Kim
with the rubbish.

28:42.974 --> 28:44.641
Five!
‐ The rubbish?

28:44.642 --> 28:46.310
Wait‐‐ are you married?

28:46.311 --> 28:47.351
‐ No. Four!

28:47.352 --> 28:49.313
Oh, not yet.
That's my engagement ring.

28:49.314 --> 28:51.315
Three!
‐ You're with a guy?

28:52.316 --> 28:54.359

28:54.360 --> 28:55.986
Two!

28:56.820 --> 28:59.322

28:59.323 --> 29:01.324
Very good. Okay, let's go.

29:01.325 --> 29:04.661
Okay, who's excited about the surprise?

29:04.662 --> 29:06.621
Bye‐bye, rubbish!

29:06.622 --> 29:07.663
<i>Welcome, everyone,</i>

29:07.664 --> 29:10.145
<i>to the Pleasant Valley Farm experience.</i>

29:10.146 --> 29:12.628
<i>Who wants to see some sheep?</i>

29:13.670 --> 29:16.214
<i>That's lucky,
because you're about to meet</i>

29:16.215 --> 29:19.405
<i>Pleasant Valley's
flock of resident mammals.</i>

29:19.406 --> 29:22.595
‐ Isn't the tractor amazing, Uncle David?

29:22.596 --> 29:24.681
<i>Even though sheep
aren't native to Australia,</i>

29:24.682 --> 29:25.640
<i>we certainly do have...</i>

29:25.641 --> 29:27.600
Miss Caroline, where are the sheep?

29:27.601 --> 29:30.521
<i>Um... They're usually around here.</i>

29:31.605 --> 29:32.648
<i>They must be hiding.</i>

29:44.660 --> 29:47.245
‐ I've just gotta check
on something ahead.

29:47.246 --> 29:49.623
<i>Sorry we haven't seen
any sheep yet, kiddies.</i>

29:49.624 --> 29:50.623
‐ What is it, Miss Caroline?

29:50.624 --> 29:53.043
‐ I don't know, Kim.
There must be something in the way.

29:53.044 --> 29:55.066
‐ Maybe it's your dad, Felix!

29:55.067 --> 29:57.088
‐ No, it isn't.
‐ Yeah, Max!

29:57.089 --> 29:58.923
For all we know,
you don't have a dad either.

29:58.924 --> 30:01.510
Never seen any evidence of him
when I'm visiting your mom.

30:01.511 --> 30:03.177
‐ Do you know my mom?
‐ Uh‐huh.

30:03.178 --> 30:06.515
‐ Okay. David?
May I have a word with you, please?

30:08.141 --> 30:09.685
David's in trouble!

30:12.375 --> 30:14.105
Hey.

30:14.106 --> 30:15.940
What are you doing to our sheep, mate?

30:15.941 --> 30:18.318
‐ Look, I don't know what's
going on with you right now,

30:18.319 --> 30:20.466
but that kind of behavior
is unacceptable.

30:20.467 --> 30:22.613
‐ Max started it!
‐ Max is five years old!

30:22.614 --> 30:25.617
And if you can't use appropriate language
with a five‐year‐old,

30:25.618 --> 30:27.619
I'm going to have to ask you
to disembark the tractor train

30:27.620 --> 30:28.661
and wait for us back at the bus.

30:28.662 --> 30:30.288

David! Start the tractor!

30:58.567 --> 31:01.653

the tractor, Uncle David?

31:05.157 --> 31:07.533
Miss Caroline! I'm coming!

31:07.534 --> 31:10.286
‐ Push the clutch pedal down.
‐ Where?

31:10.287 --> 31:13.332
‐ The clutch pedal is on the left,
the brake is on the other side.

31:13.333 --> 31:14.437

31:15.542 --> 31:17.084

31:17.085 --> 31:19.630

brake off, Uncle David?

31:19.631 --> 31:20.713

31:20.714 --> 31:22.465
‐ The parking brake is that side too.

31:22.466 --> 31:24.218
‐ Why do you know so much about tractors?

31:24.219 --> 31:25.969
‐ I love tractors.

31:29.682 --> 31:31.850

40:44.612 --> 40:46.613
Well, if you make noise, they hear you.

40:46.614 --> 40:48.636

40:48.637 --> 40:50.658
And the only way you can stop them

is by shooting them in the face
with your shooty gun

42:29.716 --> 42:32.552

42:37.683 --> 42:40.561
these children believe they are
in the middle of a game.

42:40.562 --> 42:43.271

Cough it up.

43:35.616 --> 43:38.744

It's anaphylaxis.

43:38.745 --> 43:40.454
No. No, they're just chips.

43:40.455 --> 43:42.163

44:06.438 --> 44:08.669
‐ What?!
‐ No, no. It's fine. Here.

44:08.670 --> 44:10.901
‐ No, you can't reinsert it!
‐ No.

44:10.902 --> 44:12.652
No! Um...

44:12.653 --> 44:14.612
There's a spare!
Tess packed a spare!

44:14.613 --> 44:17.074
‐ Where is it?
‐ It's, it's‐‐ in his backpack!

44:19.117 --> 44:20.639
I'll go get it. I'll go get it.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.162
Don't leave.

44:24.519 --> 44:26.874
‐ I'm here.

44:26.875 --> 44:29.168
- Okay, kids.
- ‐

44:29.169 --> 44:32.338
‐ No, no. I'm right here, bud.
I'm right here.

44:32.339 --> 44:35.634
‐ Listen very carefully.
I need you to stay here with David.

44:35.635 --> 44:38.679
Hold hands and don't let go
until I get back.

44:38.680 --> 44:40.137
Okay?

44:40.138 --> 44:42.682
Breathe. You'll be all right.

44:42.683 --> 44:45.184
‐ Get them to stop the game,
Miss Caroline!

44:45.185 --> 44:47.729
‐ Don't worry about it.
I'll just pop right up and let them know.

44:47.730 --> 44:49.814
‐ Breathe. You're all right.

44:49.815 --> 44:52.693
You'll be all right.
There we go. Breathing.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.504
‐ Just try to breathe, mate, please.
Keep breathing.

46:09.770 --> 46:10.812
‐ Argh!

46:17.819 --> 46:19.613
‐ We get through this,
you can dress up as Darth Vader

46:19.614 --> 46:20.989
and play the shooty game
as much as you want.

46:20.990 --> 46:22.269
I don't care what your mom says.

46:41.635 --> 46:42.635
‐ You!

46:57.818 --> 46:59.610
‐ Guys, what do we do when we're scared?

46:59.611 --> 47:02.114
What's a song we can sing?
What's his favorite song?

47:02.115 --> 47:04.031
‐ "Shake It Off."
‐ "Shake It Off"?

47:04.032 --> 47:06.410
How does it start?
Beth, can you sing it for him?

47:07.244 --> 47:09.037

48:11.266 --> 48:13.894
Oh, here we go. Here we go.
‐ Okay. Hold still.

48:15.437 --> 48:16.563
Yes.

48:20.275 --> 48:21.359
Did it work?

48:21.360 --> 48:22.861
‐
‐ Well?

48:31.828 --> 48:34.164
Oh! Oh, God!

48:36.291 --> 48:37.376
Thank you, Miss Caroline.

48:37.377 --> 48:39.086
‐ It's my job.

48:39.878 --> 48:41.839
And you've got to call me Audrey.

48:41.840 --> 48:43.173
‐ Yeah.

48:45.884 --> 48:47.468
Eugh!

48:47.469 --> 48:49.053
‐ Oh... I...

48:49.054 --> 48:51.682
...g‐got caught in the middle
of a jam fight!

48:52.975 --> 48:55.227
‐ I am covered in strawberry jam!

48:55.228 --> 48:57.813
Eugh. Don't taste it, okay?

48:57.814 --> 49:00.399
What jam?
‐ Felix will be fine.

49:17.666 --> 49:19.459
Stop screaming, please!

49:19.460 --> 49:20.960
Just shut up!

49:20.961 --> 49:22.545
What is that noise?

49:22.546 --> 49:25.716
It's a helicopter!
They've come to get me!

49:26.842 --> 49:28.176
Get out of my way!

49:28.177 --> 49:29.761
What the...?!

49:29.762 --> 49:32.764
‐ I'm coming! They found me!

49:34.183 --> 49:37.144
Hey! Hey! Hey!

49:38.520 --> 49:40.814
It's me! I'm a celebr‐‐

49:40.815 --> 49:43.775
Oh! Arggh! Oh, fuck!

49:49.781 --> 49:50.866
Whoa!

49:51.867 --> 49:52.951
Fuck!

49:53.619 --> 49:56.287
Open up! Hey!
Can you open the door?

49:56.288 --> 49:58.790
I'm sorry about what happened
before, but you‐‐

49:58.791 --> 50:00.375
Get the fuck over here!

50:00.376 --> 50:02.376
Please?!

50:02.377 --> 50:05.254
I'm just scared. Open the door.

50:05.255 --> 50:09.218
You're being a bad teacher!
Fuck your teaching method!

50:09.219 --> 50:11.762
This is a terrible example you're setting!

50:11.763 --> 50:13.763
Argh! Argh!

50:19.770 --> 50:20.770
‐ Teddy!

50:21.230 --> 50:22.272
Get up!

50:22.606 --> 50:25.359
Come on! Give me your hand!

50:45.796 --> 50:48.548
Oh, this is all my fault.

50:48.549 --> 50:51.592
God is punishing me.
‐ Wait, what do you mean?

50:51.593 --> 50:55.556
‐ I've been bad, man.
I've been really fucking bad.

50:55.557 --> 50:57.474
‐ I'm sure we've all done
things we regret.

50:57.475 --> 51:00.393
‐ I fucked a shit‐ton of moms.

51:00.394 --> 51:03.584
We're talking thousands.
Thousands.

51:03.585 --> 51:06.774
I was doing my first public appearance,

51:06.775 --> 51:11.780
and this sweet little single mom
came up to me after the autograph signing.

51:11.781 --> 51:14.115
And she was so fucking beautiful.

51:14.116 --> 51:18.161
And I went down on her pussy
in a South Coast Plaza disabled toilet.

51:18.162 --> 51:19.996
And then it was on.

51:19.997 --> 51:22.665
I just...
I took whoever I could get.

51:22.666 --> 51:25.919
Single moms, married moms, pregnant moms,

51:25.920 --> 51:29.173
white moms, black moms, dyke moms, Jews.

51:30.549 --> 51:34.761
‐ My nephew almost died. I'm‐‐
‐ I studied at the Actors Studio.

51:34.762 --> 51:37.764
I learnt Meisner from Pacino.

51:37.765 --> 51:39.016
Al.

51:40.976 --> 51:43.395
You think I wanted to be
in a polka dot suit

51:43.396 --> 51:45.105
for the rest of my life?

51:45.939 --> 51:48.150
I fucking hate
those little kiddlywinks.

51:49.526 --> 51:52.738
Fucking the shit out of their moms
was the only thing that made it better.

51:52.739 --> 51:54.572
Until it didn't.

51:54.573 --> 51:56.575
You realize that you're only doing it‐‐

51:56.576 --> 51:58.075
Look at me.

51:58.076 --> 52:02.623
You realize that you're only doing it
because you're dead inside.

52:03.916 --> 52:07.794
And it's the only thing that's keeping you
from killing yourself.

52:10.631 --> 52:12.049
‐ I'm Dave.

52:13.509 --> 52:15.928
‐ Teddy McGiggle isn't even my real name.

52:16.637 --> 52:18.429
It's Nathan.

52:18.430 --> 52:19.597
‐ Nathan McGiggle.

52:19.598 --> 52:21.391
‐ Nathan Schneider.
‐ Oh.

52:25.229 --> 52:27.397
‐ What is that awful smell?

52:31.109 --> 52:33.110
It's me, man. I was lying.

52:33.111 --> 52:36.532
I was gonna blame you, but I can't.
I shit my pants.

52:37.908 --> 52:40.786
Ohh, God!

52:40.787 --> 52:42.746
I did it.

52:47.084 --> 52:49.586
Ohh, no!

53:16.822 --> 53:19.240
‐ Sir? This could be helpful.

53:19.241 --> 53:24.371
Aerial reconnaissance confirms
all of the infected are congregated here.

53:24.372 --> 53:27.708

55:29.454 --> 55:30.496
Yes, Mickey?

55:30.497 --> 55:33.478
‐ Miss Caroline,
is there anything to eat?

55:33.479 --> 55:36.242
‐ I'm afraid you ate
the last of the chips.

55:36.243 --> 55:39.006
‐ I have tofu snacks
if you want them, Mickey.

55:39.007 --> 55:40.215
‐ Yuck.

55:40.841 --> 55:44.553
‐ When are we gonna play
putt‐putt golf, Miss Caroline?

55:44.554 --> 55:47.973
‐ Certainly not now.
Go to sleep.

55:54.688 --> 55:55.813
‐ This is ridiculous.

55:55.814 --> 55:57.816
‐ What's the US military
even doing here?

55:57.817 --> 55:59.150
‐ Excuse me!

55:59.151 --> 56:02.779
My son is inside.
Why won't you let us through?

56:04.364 --> 56:06.282
I'm gonna try him again.

56:06.283 --> 56:12.206
‐ Got kangaroo, platypus,
echidna, wombat. Dingo?

56:12.207 --> 56:14.540
‐ Lieutenant, sir.
Why are we here?

56:14.541 --> 56:17.294
‐ Zombies again.
‐ Well, fast ones or slow ones, sir?

56:17.295 --> 56:19.796
‐ Slow.
We need to contain the infection,

56:19.797 --> 56:21.798
so shoot anything that moves.

56:22.799 --> 56:24.718
‐ Thank God they're slow.

56:24.719 --> 56:25.969
‐ Mm‐hmm.

56:27.763 --> 56:30.766
<i>Hey, it's Dave.
Just leave a message.</i>

56:30.767 --> 56:33.726
‐ Dave, I'm here. I'm nearby.

56:33.727 --> 56:36.813
They won't let me past to where you are,
and they won't tell us anything.

56:40.317 --> 56:41.442
If you get this message,

56:41.443 --> 56:43.820
could you please tell Felix
that Mommy loves him?

56:46.323 --> 56:48.283
Dave, please look after him.

56:52.829 --> 56:55.540
‐ Hey. Are you okay, mate?

56:55.541 --> 56:58.794
‐ Yes, but Beth is a bit frightened.

56:58.795 --> 57:01.588
‐ My mom puts me to bed.

57:01.589 --> 57:03.548
‐ Oh.

57:03.549 --> 57:05.217
Well, we're gonna see your mom tomorrow.

57:05.218 --> 57:06.676
‐ I'm scared.

57:06.677 --> 57:10.514
‐ My mommy made up a special rhyme
to help me go to sleep.

57:10.515 --> 57:12.307
Do you want to hear it?

57:13.517 --> 57:17.228
"Now the day is over
and I'm in bed, rugged up tight,

57:17.229 --> 57:21.024
"I hope those little monsters
won't get me in the night.

57:21.025 --> 57:24.820
"If I say this little rhyme,
they'll try to put up a fight,

57:24.821 --> 57:26.028
"But they won't come get me,

57:26.029 --> 57:28.781
"No, they won't give me a fright.

57:28.782 --> 57:31.576
Little monsters, you go away!
Little monsters‐‐"

57:31.577 --> 57:34.788
‐ Oh, I think we need Beth
to help with this bit, yeah?

57:34.789 --> 57:37.791
Beth, when I point at you,
can you say, "Go away"?

57:37.792 --> 57:39.793
‐ Go away?
‐ Yeah, exactly like that.

57:39.794 --> 57:41.294
Yeah. Okay, let's start again.

57:41.295 --> 57:44.339
"Little monsters, you can't stay!

57:44.340 --> 57:47.050
"I don't want to see your little claws!

57:47.051 --> 57:49.761
"I don't want to hear your little roars!

57:49.762 --> 57:51.013
Little monsters‐‐"

57:51.014 --> 57:52.138
‐ "Go away!"

57:52.139 --> 57:54.725
‐ "Come back and see me in the day.

57:54.726 --> 57:57.269
"We can have a little party

57:57.270 --> 57:59.812
"And eat cake and tea and play.

57:59.813 --> 58:02.232
"But we all must get a proper sleep,

58:02.233 --> 58:04.818
So, little monsters, please..."

58:04.819 --> 58:06.027
‐ "Go away!"

58:06.028 --> 58:09.323
‐ That's it.
That's exactly it.

58:09.324 --> 58:11.012
You reckon you can sleep now?

58:11.013 --> 58:12.701
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Yeah? Okay.

58:15.037 --> 58:17.789
‐ How did you know the rhyme, Uncle David?

58:18.874 --> 58:22.794
‐ Well, your mom used to sing it
to me before I went to sleep.

58:22.795 --> 58:24.795
Back when I was Boo‐Boo.

58:24.796 --> 58:26.798
- ‐ Boo‐Boo?
- ‐ Boo‐Boo, yeah.

58:26.799 --> 58:28.078
You want to get some rest, mate?

58:33.722 --> 58:35.766
‐ Goodnight, Uncle David.
‐ 'Night, mate.

58:47.653 --> 58:50.739
‐
‐ Oh, God.

59:25.941 --> 59:28.360
‐ Sorry I've been swearing
so much, Audrey.

59:29.319 --> 59:30.779
‐ That's fine, David.

59:32.239 --> 59:34.366
I'm fucking terrified too.

59:36.118 --> 59:39.162
I just need them to feel like
the adults are in control, you know?

59:42.457 --> 59:46.170
- How do you do it?
- Do what?

59:47.045 --> 59:48.380
‐ Be a superhero.

59:49.381 --> 59:50.924
‐ Not quite.

59:53.343 --> 59:54.969
Do you want kids?

59:54.970 --> 59:57.680
‐ Oh... my girlfriend and I just split.

59:57.681 --> 01:00:00.392
Yeah, I caught her with someone else.

01:00:00.393 --> 01:00:01.392
‐ Oh.

01:00:02.227 --> 01:00:03.478
That's... awful.

01:00:06.648 --> 01:00:07.900
‐ See, it wasn't her fault.

01:00:08.942 --> 01:00:10.402
I left first.

01:00:11.403 --> 01:00:13.405
She wanted a baby. I didn't.

01:00:14.865 --> 01:00:16.158
‐ How come?

01:00:17.409 --> 01:00:19.745
‐ I told her I didn't want it
to get in the way of my band.

01:00:19.746 --> 01:00:22.372
‐ Was that not the reason?

01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:27.669
‐ Felix's mom reckons I might be
frightened of being a father.

01:00:30.339 --> 01:00:33.862
See, our dad left
when I was about Felix's age.

01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:37.626
Started another family,
left Tess and I with mom.

01:00:37.627 --> 01:00:41.391
Mom fell apart.
Like, <i>really</i> fell apart.

01:00:43.852 --> 01:00:46.146
We spent our holidays in psych wards.

01:00:46.813 --> 01:00:49.775
‐ I'm so sorry.
‐ Yeah.

01:00:50.859 --> 01:00:52.319
Tess looked after me.

01:00:55.364 --> 01:00:58.367
I couldn't see that at the time, though.
I was too angry at everyone.

01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:01.912
I never thanked her.

01:01:02.871 --> 01:01:05.916
‐ I'm sure you won't end up
like your father, David.

01:01:09.378 --> 01:01:13.402
"The man in between
waits between the two,

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:17.396
"Not hearing the lie,
not seeing the true,

01:01:17.397 --> 01:01:20.832
"Unknowing what is
and denying what seems,

01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:24.268
And there he will sleep,
the man in between."

01:01:25.602 --> 01:01:28.145
‐ Wow. Is that Gandhi?

01:01:28.146 --> 01:01:30.399
‐
No. Neil Diamond.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.088
‐ You like Neil Diamond?

01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:33.777
‐ I love Neil Diamond.

01:01:35.362 --> 01:01:36.404
‐ Oh.

01:01:36.405 --> 01:01:40.366
‐ You may think I'm a superhero, but...

01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:44.538
When I was 18,
I was heading down a really bad path.

01:01:45.414 --> 01:01:48.624
I started following this band around.

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:52.379
I used the money my parents
had put away for my education,

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.006
and I followed them here.

01:01:54.007 --> 01:01:54.881
‐ Whoa.

01:01:54.882 --> 01:01:57.175
‐ I chased them all around Australia,

01:01:57.176 --> 01:02:00.136
and I break into one of
their hotel rooms in Perth.

01:02:00.137 --> 01:02:03.140
Well, I was just so determined
to meet one of them in person.

01:02:04.141 --> 01:02:05.976
I would have let them
do anything to me.

01:02:08.395 --> 01:02:10.229
‐ What... what happened?

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:16.069
‐ Oh, Taylor walked into the room
and called security right away.

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:18.030
‐ Hang on. Wait. Swift?

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:20.406
‐ No!

01:02:20.407 --> 01:02:23.410
Taylor Hanson. Sorry.
I thought I said who they were.

01:02:23.411 --> 01:02:25.453
‐ Taylor Hanson?

01:02:25.454 --> 01:02:28.415
‐ Yeah. Taylor Hanson.
From Hanson.

01:02:28.416 --> 01:02:30.167
‐ Hanson the band?

01:02:30.959 --> 01:02:32.335
‐ Yes.

01:02:32.336 --> 01:02:34.671
‐ "Mmmbop"?
‐ "Mmmbop."

01:02:35.756 --> 01:02:37.673
‐ Mmm. Okay.

01:02:37.674 --> 01:02:42.304
‐ I begged him not to call security,
but he didn't even hesitate.

01:02:42.305 --> 01:02:44.681
I didn't know what to do,
so I jumped out the window.

01:02:44.682 --> 01:02:45.723
‐ Shit.

01:02:45.724 --> 01:02:50.354
‐ But thank God, an awning broke my fall
and all I broke was my collarbone.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.398
So, there I was.

01:02:54.399 --> 01:02:58.487
In a foreign country, in a sling.
No parents, no money.

01:02:58.488 --> 01:03:01.406
And then a wonderful thing happened.

01:03:02.282 --> 01:03:04.659
I got a job helping out at the school

01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:07.663
to help pay my medical bills
and get back home.

01:03:07.664 --> 01:03:09.373
And working with kids...

01:03:11.458 --> 01:03:13.897
...standing in front of them,

01:03:13.898 --> 01:03:16.337
looking at me with no judgment...

01:03:16.338 --> 01:03:19.424
They trusted me even when I didn't
particularly trust myself.

01:03:20.467 --> 01:03:24.388
I started to believe in myself again,
you know?

01:03:24.389 --> 01:03:25.806
Learned to step up.

01:03:26.515 --> 01:03:29.351
And now I can't imagine
doing anything else.

01:03:31.353 --> 01:03:34.398
‐ Are you and... Ian gonna have kids?

01:03:36.108 --> 01:03:40.153
‐ I'm afraid Ian and I have not
been together for a long time.

01:03:40.696 --> 01:03:43.407
He was cheating on me.
With someone from his work.

01:03:45.325 --> 01:03:47.034
‐ But why do you still wear the ring?

01:03:47.035 --> 01:03:50.289
‐ It stops fathers from hitting
on me in the playground.

01:03:50.873 --> 01:03:52.164
I know it's bad to lie,

01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:54.751
but you'd be surprised
how crude men can be.

01:04:00.966 --> 01:04:02.926
‐ My band broke up six years ago.

01:04:04.386 --> 01:04:06.972
God's Sledgehammer fell apart
when my bandmates quit.

01:04:10.058 --> 01:04:11.768
And I'm not really Christian.

01:04:14.396 --> 01:04:16.106
‐ Anything else you've lied about?

01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:20.360
‐
No, I think that pretty much covers it.

01:04:20.361 --> 01:04:21.402
‐ Okay. Good.

01:04:21.403 --> 01:04:24.531
Otherwise I'd have to put you
in the naughty corner.

01:04:25.782 --> 01:04:28.994
‐ Uh‐oh.
‐

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.747
Why don't I stay up on watch?

01:04:32.706 --> 01:04:35.000
‐ No, no. You need sleep more than anyone.

01:04:36.126 --> 01:04:37.377
Um... I'll step up.

01:04:38.378 --> 01:04:39.421
‐ Okay.

01:04:45.385 --> 01:04:46.470
‐ 'Night.

01:05:00.734 --> 01:05:03.403
<i>All‐unit command, all‐unit command.</i>

01:05:04.738 --> 01:05:07.199
<i>All‐unit command, all‐unit command.</i>

01:05:09.409 --> 01:05:12.161
‐ In order to ensure total
annihilation of the infected,

01:05:12.162 --> 01:05:16.917
we will proceed with Operation Hailstorm
in T‐minus one hour.

01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:27.427
‐
‐ Oh!

01:05:29.888 --> 01:05:32.766
I've got an idea to get us out of here.

01:05:32.767 --> 01:05:35.394
‐ No. No, no, no!

01:05:35.395 --> 01:05:37.396
No, no, no.

01:05:37.397 --> 01:05:39.355
No.

01:05:39.356 --> 01:05:42.400
I'm not going anywhere.
Want to know why?

01:05:42.401 --> 01:05:46.113
Because I'm the Nickelodeon Kid's Choice
Favorite Global Television Presenter

01:05:46.114 --> 01:05:47.447
five years running, that's why.

01:05:47.448 --> 01:05:48.781
You want to know what that means?

01:05:48.782 --> 01:05:52.369
That means to the layman
I'm a huge fucking deal.

01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:54.517
Someone will notice that I'm missing,

01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:56.529
sound the alarm,
and come and get me.

01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:58.541
‐ We can't stay here indefinitely.

01:05:58.542 --> 01:06:00.419
‐ We're good as dead if we stay here.
There's no food.

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.546
‐
We'll eat one of the kids.

01:06:03.505 --> 01:06:05.299
‐ I hope you're joking.

01:06:06.758 --> 01:06:09.553
‐ Look, Teddy, all we need
for you to do is make a distraction

01:06:09.554 --> 01:06:11.388
while I make a run for the tractor train.

01:06:11.389 --> 01:06:12.638
I drive it to the front door,

01:06:12.639 --> 01:06:14.266
we load everyone up,
and we drive out of here.

01:06:14.267 --> 01:06:16.018
‐ Oh, you're fucked in the head, fatso.

01:06:16.019 --> 01:06:17.393
Why can't you go?

01:06:17.394 --> 01:06:19.354
‐ I'm not leaving the children
alone with you.

01:06:19.355 --> 01:06:20.104
‐ Pfft!

01:06:20.105 --> 01:06:23.754
If your big idea
is to drive in a tractor

01:06:23.755 --> 01:06:26.580
designed to pull fuckmonkeys
around a farm,

01:06:26.581 --> 01:06:29.405
then you're bigger idiots than I thought.

01:06:29.406 --> 01:06:32.159
And I thought you were both
the stupidest people I've ever met.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.204
‐ What would you suggest?
‐ The McGigglemobile.

01:06:36.413 --> 01:06:37.413
‐ What?

01:06:37.414 --> 01:06:39.123
‐ What, are you fucking deaf?

01:06:39.124 --> 01:06:42.461
I said in a loud whisper,
"The McGigglemobile."

01:06:42.462 --> 01:06:43.920
‐ What's the McGigglemobile?

01:06:43.921 --> 01:06:47.361
‐ It's my bright red car,
you fucking cunt.

01:06:47.362 --> 01:06:50.801
I travel around the world in it
making memories

01:06:50.802 --> 01:06:55.390
and sharing those memories
with children all over the country.

01:06:55.391 --> 01:06:56.725
Many countries.

01:06:57.601 --> 01:06:59.268
‐ Why is that better?

01:06:59.269 --> 01:07:03.774
‐ The McGigglemobile has a flap
in the roof. The Frogsie flap.

01:07:03.775 --> 01:07:04.482
We drive the car around,

01:07:04.483 --> 01:07:07.069
the kiddlywinks jump
into the McGigglemobile

01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:08.194
through the Frogsie flap,

01:07:08.195 --> 01:07:11.573
and we drive the fuck out of here.

01:07:11.574 --> 01:07:12.699
‐ Who's got the keys?

01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:16.578
That actually could work.

01:07:18.205 --> 01:07:19.206
‐ Great idea, Teddy.

01:07:20.165 --> 01:07:21.458
‐ Great enough for a blow job?

01:07:24.378 --> 01:07:27.256
Um... I'm a sex addict.

01:07:36.598 --> 01:07:38.600
Hey. Listen.

01:07:39.351 --> 01:07:41.227
Be careful when you‐‐

01:07:41.228 --> 01:07:43.105
‐ Aarrghh! Goddammit!

01:07:44.398 --> 01:07:45.815
‐ Are you okay, Teddy?

01:07:45.816 --> 01:07:48.443
‐ Does it look like I'm okay,
you shithead?!

01:07:49.486 --> 01:07:53.030
Miss Caroline! Miss Caroline!

01:07:53.031 --> 01:07:55.617
‐
‐ Miss Caroline, I'm hungry.

01:07:55.618 --> 01:07:57.034
‐ I know.
‐ Miss Caroline?

01:07:57.035 --> 01:07:59.955
- I don't want to play this game anymore.
- Uh‐huh.

01:07:59.956 --> 01:08:02.456
‐ It makes no sense,
and the zombies look fake.

01:08:02.457 --> 01:08:06.628
‐ Miss Caroline, when are
we gonna play putt‐putt golf?!

01:08:06.629 --> 01:08:09.923
‐ Yo! Douchebag!
Are we gonna do this thing or what?

01:08:09.924 --> 01:08:11.716
‐ What's a douchebag?

01:08:11.717 --> 01:08:15.429
‐ It's a small bag that ladies
use to irrigate their vaginas.

01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:17.096
‐ One, two, three, eyes on me.

01:08:17.098 --> 01:08:18.765

01:10:07.958 --> 01:10:10.878
Just... wasn't ready
to admit it until now.

01:10:14.047 --> 01:10:17.300
Uncle David?
‐ Hey, buddy.

01:10:17.301 --> 01:10:19.469
I'm just ducking out for a bit,
okay, mate?

01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:20.762
‐ Where are you going?

01:10:21.889 --> 01:10:23.265
‐ I'm gonna get us out of here.

01:10:23.724 --> 01:10:26.351
‐ Is this still all part of the game?

01:10:26.352 --> 01:10:27.935
‐ Yeah!

01:10:27.936 --> 01:10:30.772
Yeah, of course it is.
Miss Caroline's gonna keep you safe.

01:10:31.481 --> 01:10:33.587
You do whatever
she tells you to, okay?

01:10:33.588 --> 01:10:35.694
‐ She's my teacher.
I have to do that.

01:10:36.778 --> 01:10:38.404
‐ You're an amazing boy.

01:10:38.405 --> 01:10:40.865
Don't let anyone ever tell you
you're not strong.

01:10:40.866 --> 01:10:43.327
You're the strongest,
bravest person I've ever met.

01:10:44.119 --> 01:10:45.871
‐ Why are you telling me this?

01:10:46.788 --> 01:10:48.207
‐ 'Cause you're awesome.

01:10:48.957 --> 01:10:50.083
Give me a cuddle.

01:10:55.797 --> 01:10:56.798
Okay.

01:10:58.133 --> 01:11:00.427
Hey, kids, who wants a ride
in the McGigglemobile?

01:11:00.428 --> 01:11:02.679
Yeah!
‐ Yeah!

01:11:03.639 --> 01:11:07.518
‐ See you soon, kiddlywinks!

01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:28.664
‐ I see the McGigglemobile.

01:11:29.331 --> 01:11:32.417
I can't do this.
I'm a celebrity.

01:11:35.796 --> 01:11:37.631
‐ Want to make up for all
the bad things you've done?

01:11:37.632 --> 01:11:39.341
All those mums you fucked?

01:11:40.926 --> 01:11:43.303
If Pacino were here,
what would he say?

01:11:43.304 --> 01:11:44.387
‐ He'd encourage me

01:11:44.388 --> 01:11:48.141
to magnify and intensify
my connection to the material

01:11:48.142 --> 01:11:51.895
by understanding my character's
emotional experience.

01:11:51.896 --> 01:11:54.397
- ‐ Well... do that.
- ‐

01:11:54.398 --> 01:11:57.359
‐ Do it for Pacino.
I'll distract them.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.862
I'll see you
at the McGigglemobile.

01:11:59.863 --> 01:12:02.865
‐
‐ Hey!

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.120
Hey! Yeah!

01:12:09.121 --> 01:12:11.123
‐
‐ Yes! Yes!

01:12:11.999 --> 01:12:13.457
Fuck!

01:12:13.458 --> 01:12:14.877
