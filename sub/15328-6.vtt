00:01.835 --> 00:02.544
- It's not my book.

00:02.627 --> 00:05.130
- Listen to this garbage.

00:05.213 --> 00:06.423
"In Marius' arms,

00:06.506 --> 00:12.262
Millicent melted like a candle
on a birthday cake."

00:12.345 --> 00:15.557
- Suddenly, I want cake.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.600
- I keep telling you,
it's not my book.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.602
It was in the bag
I borrowed from Grandma Maggie.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.979
- Uh, don't tell me.

00:21.062 --> 00:22.605
Is that
one of those romance novels?

00:22.689 --> 00:23.565
When I was in high school,

00:23.648 --> 00:26.109
she had stacks
of those cheesy things.

00:26.192 --> 00:29.237
- Now, I want cheese.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.906
- I can't believe she still
reads that sentimental trash.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.283
- I'll give it
back to her tomorrow.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.827
But I'm keeping the bag,
it makes me look older.

00:35.910 --> 00:39.414
- Yeah, like Grandma Maggie.

00:39.497 --> 00:40.957
- Bag's going back.

00:43.209 --> 00:47.297
- "Love's Binding Release"
by Sherry Chardonnay.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.257
What's it about anyway?

00:49.340 --> 00:53.803
- It looks like it's about
some dude with lady hair.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.347
- Mostly it seems to be about
overwritten descriptions.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.600
Let's see.

00:58.683 --> 01:01.311
"His passion made her
feel like a sandcastle,

01:01.394 --> 01:05.190
surrendering to the warm embrace
of a tropical surf."

01:05.272 --> 01:08.067

to take this seriously.

02:17.887 --> 02:18.721
- Okay.

02:18.805 --> 02:19.848
- I really want to impress
Ms. Galula.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.475
- He has a little bit
of a crush on his teacher.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.895
- Nah-ah,
I am straight up in love.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.190
So, tell me about
your first day on Earth.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.234
- Skip ahead, Romeo.

02:31.317 --> 02:35.864
I've got a situation
coming in at 3:15 from Syracuse.

02:35.947 --> 02:36.948
- Mom, why don't you
tell him about

02:37.031 --> 02:38.700
when you were a classy lady?

02:38.783 --> 02:39.993
- She still is a classy lady.

02:40.076 --> 02:44.414
Look how
she's rocking that jumpsuit.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.375
- Oh, thank you, baby.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.752
But she's talking about
Classy Lady Cosmetics.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.297
I used to sell them
door to door.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.756
Ding dong!

02:53.840 --> 02:56.259
Classy Lady!

02:56.342 --> 02:56.759
- How long did you sell makeup?

02:56.843 --> 02:58.720
- Twenty years.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.430
She retired
when I was in college.

03:00.513 --> 03:01.639
- Do you want to be young

03:01.723 --> 03:03.391
or do you
want to be interviewed?

03:06.477 --> 03:09.272
- Young.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.024
- After I stopped ding-donging,

03:11.107 --> 03:14.736
I started living off the money
I made in the market.

03:14.819 --> 03:15.278
- Mm.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.863
What are we talking?

03:16.946 --> 03:19.449
Stock market, black market,
farmer's market?

03:19.532 --> 03:21.242
- What?

03:21.326 --> 03:22.118
Stuff goes down there.

03:22.201 --> 03:25.747
- I'm talking about
my investments.

of this goose?

03:41.012 --> 03:43.431

03:43.514 --> 03:46.267
I bought low, now I live high.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.938

Can we spice you up

04:08.748 --> 04:11.668
Let's see what
you get up to in chapter three.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.712
- Oh, good, you found the book.

04:14.796 --> 04:15.505
- Yes.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.839
I found it, indeed.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.676
- I left it by the front door
so I'd remember to bring it

04:19.759 --> 04:20.677
to Grandma Maggie's,
and it just vanished.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.762
Where was it?

04:22.845 --> 04:26.307
- Oh, under the thing...
by the other things.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.519
There were things involved.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.814
- Dad...were you reading
this romance book?

04:32.897 --> 04:36.442
- [laughs] Okay, first,
I picked it up for a laugh,

04:36.526 --> 04:38.194
then I got hooked.

04:38.277 --> 04:40.196
There's this ski instructor,
the Lady Millicent Griswold,

04:40.279 --> 04:43.032
who falls in love
with the Duke of Meryl,

04:43.116 --> 04:44.701
who was switched at birth
with the Earl of Meryl.

04:44.784 --> 04:48.162
No relation.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.872
- The Earl of Meryl?

04:49.956 --> 04:51.040
Seriously?

04:51.124 --> 04:53.543
- Fine, take the book.

04:53.626 --> 04:54.043
No, I want the book.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.337
No, take the book.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.380
Uh...

04:57.463 --> 05:00.174
I am a grown doctor.

05:00.258 --> 05:01.175
But I gotta finish.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.468
It's a matter of life and death.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.554
- No, it isn't,
but your job is.

05:04.637 --> 05:05.805
Don't you have surgery?

05:08.016 --> 05:09.559
- So I have to wait
to find out what happens

05:09.642 --> 05:16.399
because stupid Mr. Rabinowitz
can't lay off the mayonnaise.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.942
Maybe I didn't hear my beeper.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.280
- Dad.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.240
- Fine.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.877

folded five years ago.

golden goose is dead.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.218

fancy facts

Leave your grandma alone.

What are you studying in school

09:29.568 --> 09:32.697
So I might have borrowed
her driver's license,

09:32.780 --> 09:36.534
social security card,
and mother's maiden name.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.914
- You stole her identity?

09:41.998 --> 09:44.166
- Oh, like you ain't
never borrowed an ID.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.668
- [laughs]

09:45.751 --> 09:49.297
To be 21, not another person.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.465
- So you must know
a lot about Grandma Maggie.

09:51.549 --> 09:57.847
- In 36 states,
I am Grandma Maggie.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.934
And I know there's something
shady about her money.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.811
I think she owns a vineyard.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.855
- Why would she
keep that a secret?

10:05.938 --> 10:08.733
- Because she's stingy.

10:08.816 --> 10:11.694
She knew I'd be all up
and through that wine.

10:11.777 --> 10:15.323
Look, all I know is that
she used to get a lot of income

10:15.406 --> 10:17.867
from Chardonnay and Sherry.

10:17.950 --> 10:22.872
That's what all the check stubs
said, "Chardonnay and Sherry."

10:22.955 --> 10:24.832
- Why does that sound familiar?

10:24.915 --> 10:26.125
Is that from schools?

10:26.208 --> 10:27.293
The news?

10:27.376 --> 10:29.712
Something boring.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.839
Right, a book.

10:31.922 --> 10:33.174
This book.

10:33.257 --> 10:36.218
Grandma Maggie
is Sherry Chardonnay.

10:36.302 --> 10:41.891
- She's a jockey,
wine-making book writer!

10:41.974 --> 10:44.185
Someone book the chapel,

10:44.268 --> 10:47.229
because Mrs. Galula's
gonna love me.

10:47.313 --> 10:52.193
- It says Sherry Chardonnay is
the author of 25 romance novels.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.236
And she lives in Philadelphia!

10:54.320 --> 10:57.073
- Ah, James, lots of people live
in Philadelphia.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.407
We live in Philadelphia.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.910
- And we know
it's not any of us,

11:00.993 --> 11:02.912
so it must be Grandma Maggie.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.914
- Delois!

11:04.997 --> 11:09.335
I knew you were up to something
when you went to the snack bar

11:09.418 --> 11:14.840
and didn't ask for money!

11:14.924 --> 11:19.345
- [laughs]
Well, I'm so sorry about that...

11:19.428 --> 11:23.015
Sherry Chardonnay.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.229

11:28.312 --> 11:29.438
Thank you.

you're a romance novelist.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.454
It's cool.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.164
We're all family here.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.667
- Delois,
you are not my family.

11:49.750 --> 11:53.879
- She's a lot closer to you
than you think she is.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.507
- James, my mom
is not a romance novelist.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.843
There's no way she's been
writing these junky books

11:58.926 --> 11:59.677
for ten years!

11:59.760 --> 12:00.845
- How do you know?

12:00.928 --> 12:03.139
- Because she's always
been honest with me.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.807
- That's right, baby.

12:04.890 --> 12:05.975
That shirt is hideous.

12:06.058 --> 12:10.312
And those pants
make your butt look big.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.649
- I didn't wanna say nothing.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.943
- A little too honest,
but you made my point.

12:16.026 --> 12:21.991
Now, let's put this to rest,
so I can change my pants.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.453
Mom, are you the romance
novelist Sherry Chardonnay?

12:25.536 --> 12:27.538
- No, I am not.

12:27.621 --> 12:30.040
- Okay, subject closed.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.251
Aaron, if you're gonna do
a project on Grandma Maggie,

12:32.334 --> 12:34.170
you're going to tell
the real story.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.006
- James, you're gonna stop
investigating your grandma

12:37.089 --> 12:39.383
and making up
all sorts of craziness.

12:39.467 --> 12:43.846
And, Delois,
keep your hands off our mail!

12:43.929 --> 12:47.725

12:57.443 --> 12:59.778
Look what I got.

12:59.862 --> 13:00.738

13:00.821 --> 13:01.780

13:01.864 --> 13:03.699
Forty-eight dollars
with overnight delivery,

13:03.782 --> 13:05.367

- [laughing]
Oh, and careful, careful.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.583

"like new," so it could be

13:12.666 --> 13:14.668
dust held together
with spit and chewing gum.

But I turn the pages.

Which is missing?

13:46.700 --> 13:46.951
- What?

Oh, some seller is getting
a very strongly worded review.

Because it's definitely
my man Timothy.

14:01.465 --> 14:04.802
Even when he was blind, he could
see the love in her eyes.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.929

the Olympic two-man luge.

He's gonna lose her, too.

Please, more like

16:38.288 --> 16:40.582

here comes the good part.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.423

best friend Delois.

16:47.506 --> 16:51.176
- Sherry Chardonnay,
that's my nom de plume,

16:51.260 --> 16:54.972
which is French
for name of the plume.

16:55.055 --> 16:55.764
Mm, mm, mm.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.474
I've written over 20 books.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.935
- Delois, you liar!

17:00.018 --> 17:03.814
The only time you've been
near a book

17:03.897 --> 17:10.820
is that weekend you spent
in the ladies room at Borders.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.449
- I love romance novels.

17:13.531 --> 17:14.450
You know, I think I even read
one or two of yours.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.410

Well, I'll sign one for you.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.829

spell Mrs. Dabuley?

17:22.540 --> 17:24.792

- Well, is that Dabuley Galula
or Galula Dabuley?

17:30.549 --> 17:33.427

that Sherry Chardonnay

17:33.510 --> 17:36.680
is the coolest person
in this room

17:36.764 --> 17:40.392

She hugged me.

18:11.924 --> 18:16.512

18:18.430 --> 18:20.599
It's like my entire life

18:20.682 --> 18:23.852

Okay, maybe everything
that happened

18:25.270 --> 18:27.773
after you went to college.

18:27.856 --> 18:28.398

Do you know Sherry Chardonnay?

Nobody cares that I have no idea
who my mother is?

of course we care.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.966
Who does Millicent end up with?

18:54.049 --> 18:54.591
- Please, we need to know.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.468
- Who's Millicent?

18:56.552 --> 18:58.053
- From "Love's Binding Release."

18:58.136 --> 18:59.388
- Is that the one in the prison?

18:59.471 --> 19:03.100
- No, ski resort and a castle
and an Earl and an amulet.

19:03.183 --> 19:04.935
- Sounds vaguely familiar.

19:05.018 --> 19:08.230
Ugh, it's probably
the stable boy.

19:08.313 --> 19:11.733
They all end up
with the stable boy.

19:11.817 --> 19:12.985
- It can't be the stable boy.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.112
- Yeah, no, he died
in that freak yodeling accident

19:15.195 --> 19:18.156
in chapter seven.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.325
- Then I don't know.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.410
Why don't you all
just read the book?

19:21.493 --> 19:24.204
- We can't find a copy
with the final chapter.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.748
- Oh, I've got stacks of them
in my condo storage room.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.084
- [gasps]
To the condo storage room!

19:35.007 --> 19:37.092
- Can you at least explain why
you couldn't tell me the truth?

19:37.175 --> 19:40.762
- Because when you were
a teenager,

19:40.846 --> 19:44.766
you were always calling
romance novels stupid.

19:44.850 --> 19:45.684
And I just couldn't stand
the idea of you

19:45.767 --> 19:48.437
losing respect for me.

19:48.520 --> 19:52.149
- Ugh, but, mom, I'm an adult.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.400
Why couldn't you tell me now?

19:53.483 --> 19:56.278
- Because you're still
calling them stupid.

19:56.361 --> 20:01.199
And I just didn't want you
ripping on my writing.

20:01.283 --> 20:06.371
- Well...Charlie, and Gabby,
and Ms. Galula sure like it.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.333
Mom, I am so proud of you.

20:09.416 --> 20:13.295
In fact, I'm gonna read
a Sherry Chardonnay.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.089
And I'm gonna love it.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.342
- Oooh.

20:18.425 --> 20:21.386
Just don't read the one
about the heart surgeon

20:21.470 --> 20:26.433
and his much younger wife.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.769
I was working
through some things.

20:33.982 --> 20:37.986
