00:00.667 --> 00:02.211
<i>Previously on</i>
Party of Five...

00:02.211 --> 00:04.254
You're afraid.

00:04.254 --> 00:06.089
And guess what, Luce?
Me, too.

00:06.089 --> 00:08.050
I don't know how
to raise a baby.

00:08.050 --> 00:10.177
Or be a parent
to a 12‐year‐old.

00:11.678 --> 00:15.807
You could have any girl.
You pretty much have had
every girl.

00:15.807 --> 00:18.018
In the end, none of them
means anything to you.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.394
This one's not
gonna be different.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.271
I'm gonna go check in
with <i>Mami</i> and <i>Papi.</i>

00:21.271 --> 00:23.065
Hey, it's us.
Trying you again.

00:23.065 --> 00:24.858
I've already talked to <i>Mami.</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:27.194
Is it okay if she keeps me
company today?

00:27.194 --> 00:28.278
She said she wanted to.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.781
Vanessa:
It's not you she needs
less of, Beto.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.574
So what?

00:32.574 --> 00:34.618
Supposed to tell her
she can't call them so much?

00:34.618 --> 00:36.745
Maybe you don't
put it on Val.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.747
Val's beside herself, <i>Mami.</i>

00:38.747 --> 00:41.250
<i>I need you to find a way</i>
<i>to make her need you less.</i>

00:41.250 --> 00:42.751
Gloria (over phone):
<i>Valentina?</i>

00:43.627 --> 00:46.255
Can you help me so I'm not just
living to hear you and see you?

00:46.255 --> 00:48.465
Are we not gonna
talk anymore?

00:53.011 --> 00:55.264
("Love You Give Away"
by Xenia playing)

00:55.264 --> 00:56.640
He go back to sleep?

00:58.225 --> 01:00.227
He spent 20 minutes
grabbing my ears.

01:00.227 --> 01:03.313
Then he finally conked out.
Probably from boredom.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.983
Ah, he's still in the
sensorimotor stage
of his development.

01:05.983 --> 01:08.443
Sensorimotor. That's what?
Learning through touching?

01:08.443 --> 01:11.738
‐Mmm. Have you been reading
Piaget to impress me?
‐Mm‐mm.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.284

Mm. If we're gonna rely
on that alone,

‐Uh, right. Why?

03:54.025 --> 03:55.277
Uh, well, I was
just on the phone

03:55.277 --> 03:56.319
with some lady who was asking.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.446
She's hosting a party

03:57.446 --> 03:59.197
and her caterer dropped out

04:04.077 --> 04:06.538
For Mexican food. Seriously?

04:06.538 --> 04:08.623
Yeah. I, I got her information,
just in case.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.545
I'm telling you.
Stick with this guy, Vanessa.
He's going places.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.213
Well, I'm not going to Hamburg.

04:15.213 --> 04:19.050
Yeah, but...
maybe Beverly Hills?

04:21.511 --> 04:23.054
(dryer door slams)

04:23.054 --> 04:25.390
Did you dry everything

04:25.390 --> 04:26.933
I'm not an idiot.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.269

Do you have a girlfriend, Bey?

04:29.269 --> 04:31.146

04:31.146 --> 04:33.732

04:33.732 --> 04:34.775
Oh, that? That's mine.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.153
Since when do you
wear a bra?

04:38.153 --> 04:40.614
Since Tuesday.
Beto got it for me.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.618
What? She said
<i>Mami's</i> getting ready
to buy her one.

04:44.618 --> 04:48.246
It's a training bra, Lucía.
You had one, too.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.334
You can't let her
talk you into
stuff like that.

04:52.334 --> 04:55.128
What was I supposed to do?
She wanted to get <i>Mami</i>
on the phone to okay it,

04:55.128 --> 04:57.172
and we agreed that those
check‐ins do more harm
than good.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.049
‐Why didn't you ask me?
‐'Cause you haven't been around.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.802
‐Hanging with that kid Matthew.
‐We're not hanging!

05:01.802 --> 05:04.262
I'm helping him find a job.
Open a checking account.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.682
All right. Okay. Can you...
maybe help out with Val
sometimes?

05:07.682 --> 05:09.267
Like, at least the girly stuff?

05:09.893 --> 05:11.144
I'm like, clueless.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.231
Fine. I'll try.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.608
What's a training bra train,
anyway?

05:16.608 --> 05:18.276
Don't they kinda, like,
know what to do
on their own?

05:21.988 --> 05:23.156
Stupid question?

05:23.156 --> 05:26.409
Patty:
This is what
I'm imagining.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.246
Authentic... Mexico.

05:29.246 --> 05:32.999
You see that little lady
making homemade tortillas
in the corner?

05:32.999 --> 05:35.919
Well, it's a lot to put together
in just a few days.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.004
Vanessa: Yeah, you know,
our rentals may be a bit pricey

05:38.004 --> 05:40.382
‐because of the short notice.
‐And there'll be some overtime.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.800
You know,
lots of hidden costs...

05:41.800 --> 05:43.635
Well. There's no need
to worry about that.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.220
You know,
as I said to your wife,

05:45.220 --> 05:48.974
this could lead to a lot more
event work for you. Mm?

05:49.516 --> 05:51.226
We're not, uh...

05:51.226 --> 05:54.145
Patty: You know,
my second husband and I

05:54.145 --> 05:57.065
went to Cozumel for
our third anniversary,

05:57.065 --> 06:00.443
and there was a cafe
outside the hotel
just like this.

06:00.443 --> 06:03.321
‐It's very charming.
‐Mm. It was a perfect...

06:04.948 --> 06:06.575
perfect vacation for us.

06:06.575 --> 06:10.287
He was a diver,
and I was a drinker.
(laughs)

06:10.287 --> 06:13.623
Well, we didn't make it
to year four, but as my son
always says...

06:13.623 --> 06:15.709
(clears throat)
This isn't about me.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.337
Vanessa:
So for after dinner,

06:19.337 --> 06:22.090
‐were you thinking of something
like a wedding cake?
‐No.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.634
Not necessary. No, their...

06:24.634 --> 06:27.721
Their, um, wedding was
a few days ago in Baja.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.514
It all happened very quickly.

06:29.514 --> 06:34.477
Too quickly, if you ask me.
And some things were said.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.605
Anyway...
(chuckles)

06:36.605 --> 06:39.608
This surprise party is my way
of showing my son

06:39.608 --> 06:42.235
and that chippy of his that
I have had a change of heart.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.155
And I now approve.
Mm.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.950
When can you come see the space?

06:48.950 --> 06:49.993
I vote no.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.328
Well, you don't get a vote, Val.

06:52.662 --> 06:53.913
So how are we gonna
cater a party

06:53.913 --> 06:56.124
and keep the restaurant open?
We don't have enough staff.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.251
Well, I was thinking
I could swing it
if we had Oscar.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.837
But I gave him the weekend
to move his mom into
assisted living.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.130
So, we'll just have to
close for the night.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.591
Don't we have
a lot of reservations
on Saturday?

07:04.591 --> 07:06.384
Yeah. Isn't it
our busiest night?

07:06.384 --> 07:08.053
Look, all right.
You guys need to look

07:08.053 --> 07:09.971
at this as an investment
in the future.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.389
All right? I mean,
down the line,
the plan'll be

07:11.389 --> 07:13.850
to keep the restaurant open
and expand our business

07:13.850 --> 07:14.934
by catering events.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.686
Cancelling reservations
doesn't seem like

07:16.686 --> 07:19.064
a good way to
expand a client base.
I vote no.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.733
‐Well, you don't get a vote.
‐I think we should call
<i>Mami</i> and <i>Papi</i>

07:21.733 --> 07:23.443
‐and see what they say.
‐We're not calling 'em, Val.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.321
For the record, I vote no, too.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.531
No one here gets a vote,
all right?

07:29.157 --> 07:30.241
It's my decision to make.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.035
I've made it.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.457
I know what you
must be thinking.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.377
The water bill must be obscene.
(laughs)

07:40.377 --> 07:42.504
But better for the surprise

07:42.504 --> 07:45.048
to have the party at
the tennis court than here,
don't you think?

07:45.048 --> 07:47.550
Although we'll miss out
on the view,
which is spectacular.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.843
‐Isn't it‐‐
‐Amazing.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.095
‐Ah, it's amazing.
‐Lot of smog, but‐‐

07:52.305 --> 07:54.182
We were thinking a salsa bar.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.850
Uh, and passed appetizers.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.519
‐Maybe even a seated dinner?
‐And a seated dinner.

07:57.519 --> 08:00.230
Oh, aren't you two cute?
Just perfect sync.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.440
Well, there'll be 60 guests.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.110
Uh, no way will we
have enough servers.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.821
Well, we'll just have to
call in a full staff, then.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.198
People will be grateful
for the extra work.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.076
Okay.
Show you the tennis court.

08:13.076 --> 08:13.868
Vanessa: Okay.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.832
Hey, knock it off, man.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.417
What, you want me to not
tell you if there's a problem

08:20.417 --> 08:21.751
even if there is a problem?

08:21.751 --> 08:23.169
<i>Mami</i> has that
Christmas card list.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.130
Everyone who's ever
worked for <i>Papi,</i>
just go through it.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.841
I'm sure some old employees
would be happy to come work.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.510
Especially if you sell it
as a fun gig.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.886
I mean, check it out.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.807
When did <i>Papi</i> ever have a shot
at something like this? Huh?

08:35.807 --> 08:38.268
I mean, closest he came to
was the front door,

08:38.268 --> 08:40.228
holding a delivery bag.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.438
We're inside.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.273
Yeah. To work.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.067
Vanessa:
Hey, hubby, you coming?

08:50.697 --> 08:51.865
(exhales)

09:00.749 --> 09:02.542
Who are you and
what are you doing
in my yard?

09:03.960 --> 09:05.920
Uh, we're catering the party.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.214
Huh. Grandma found
another caterer.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.968
Wow. You guys must be
super desperate for work.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.929
Well, she's paying us a ton.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.223
Mm. She's making up
for trying to get Wendy
to sign a prenup

09:17.223 --> 09:18.933
without my dad's permission.

09:18.933 --> 09:22.479
So we'll hear all about
how much it cost later.

09:22.479 --> 09:26.107
Because money equals love.

09:26.107 --> 09:29.277
Well, if that's true,
my parents don't love me at all.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.990
You know,
I have to go to this thing.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.868
But other innocent people
shouldn't suffer.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.119
You should skip.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.790
What if I can help
make it better?

09:41.790 --> 09:43.958
How? You gonna sabotage it?

09:43.958 --> 09:47.087
(chuckles)
I could give everyone
food poisoning.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.047
‐Laxatives in the guac?
‐Yeah.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.090
Okay.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.549
What would it be worth to you?

09:51.549 --> 09:53.009
A lot.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.305
Do you have your phone?
Can I give you my number?

09:57.305 --> 09:59.432
Yeah, sure.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.477
Great. I can't find mine,
and I'm pretty sure
I left the ringer on.

10:14.739 --> 10:18.326
(phone jingling)

10:22.288 --> 10:23.248
Oh.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.626
‐Success.
‐Yeah.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.920
Well, if you weren't
such a creeper,

10:28.920 --> 10:30.672
I wouldn't have gotten
my phone back.

10:30.672 --> 10:33.967
So... thanks, I guess.

10:34.884 --> 10:35.927
Yeah.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.681
And don't really
poison everyone.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.684
Too late.
The plan's already in motion.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.102
(laughs)

10:50.108 --> 10:52.110
Lucía:
<i>You changed your mind?</i>

10:52.110 --> 10:54.154
<i>What do you mean</i>
<i>you changed your mind?</i>

10:54.154 --> 10:56.865
Well, you didn't see what I saw.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.158
A house?

10:59.159 --> 11:00.785
The future.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.371
I really think this can be
the start of something.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.081
For all of us.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.250
You're probably saying that
because you didn't spend

11:07.250 --> 11:09.627
all afternoon
cancelling reservations.

11:09.627 --> 11:13.214
Did you know the Martinez's
<i>abue's</i> 90th birthday
is this Saturday?

11:13.214 --> 11:16.176
I just spent two hours
trying to find them a table
for 12 someplace else.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.052
Well, then,
we'll cater her 91st.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.679
I'm telling you, Luce. It's‐‐

11:19.679 --> 11:21.222
Do you have a fever?

11:21.222 --> 11:23.933
Your, your eyes look weird.
Do you feel okay?

11:23.933 --> 11:26.060
I feel...

11:26.060 --> 11:28.855
ah, I feel...
(sighs)

11:29.814 --> 11:31.065
It's been a while.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.402
Optimistic.

11:37.572 --> 11:40.366
(soft instrumental
music playing)

11:40.867 --> 11:43.203
(indistinct chatter)

11:44.370 --> 11:46.915
Emilio: All right, all right.
Apps are working.
Mains are prepped.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.709
And the flowers just arrived.
Is Lupita here to make
the tortillas?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.628
Uh, not yet,
but there's an hour
of cocktails

11:51.628 --> 11:54.339
after the newlyweds arrive
before dinner service, so...

11:55.506 --> 11:57.842
You think everyone
invited tonight has
a backyard like this?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.054
We brought the business cards,
right?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.639
Yes, yes. I slipped them
in your coat pocket.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.933
‐All right.
‐Don't worry. Everything's
gonna be great.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.691
(clattering)

12:13.691 --> 12:15.735
Could you make any more noise?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.988
I thought you went to
help out with that party.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.991
You're kidding, right?
I am so not on board for that.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.702
You wanna help me?
I was gonna do some cooking.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.996
Lucía:
Nah. I'm researching new places
for Mathew to live.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.122
There's a group home
in Echo Park.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.666
I'm waiting to hear
if they take minors.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.459
I was gonna
make <i>Mami's</i> menudo.

12:31.459 --> 12:34.045
That <i>tripe</i> soup?
Ooh. It's disgusting.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.839
(sighs)
Do you know where
<i>Mami's</i> recipe is?

12:36.839 --> 12:38.967
In her brain.
She never wrote anything down.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.052
Okay.
Then I'll just give her a call.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.972
Uh, you're not calling her, Val.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.849
‐Look it up on the internet.
‐It won't be the same.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.061
Didn't she teach you
how to make it?

12:51.771 --> 12:54.691
Couldn't we, like,
play Monopoly instead?

12:57.944 --> 13:00.113
‐Uh! Uh!
‐Mm?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.073
It's just a dream.

13:02.073 --> 13:05.326
Love the paper streamer things.
It's...

13:05.326 --> 13:09.163
(exhales, then chuckles)
You and your wife don't
have children, do you?

13:09.163 --> 13:12.250
‐Oh. No.
‐No. Well...

13:12.250 --> 13:14.752
No matter how many times
they get married,

13:14.752 --> 13:17.422
you wanna be sure
and be there
for every wedding.

13:17.422 --> 13:21.509
Just in case that's
the one that sticks.
Huh? (chuckles)

13:21.509 --> 13:24.804
Oh, uh, when do the
mariachis get here?

13:24.804 --> 13:27.098
‐Uh, mariachis?
‐Mm.

13:27.890 --> 13:31.811
You did see in the magazine
that there were mariachis,
didn't you?

13:31.811 --> 13:34.147
I thought those were
reference pictures.

13:36.399 --> 13:39.444
I don't know how I could have
been more clear. (chuckles)

13:40.153 --> 13:41.154
I‐‐

13:42.321 --> 13:45.575
Look, I know this is
just a job for you,

13:45.575 --> 13:49.037
but I cannot have this party
look like it was done
on the cheap.

13:49.037 --> 13:53.166
‐You understand?
‐Right, right. Um...
Uh, you know what?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.375
I can handle this.

13:55.418 --> 13:56.794
(sighs)

13:57.420 --> 13:59.088
Lucía:
Make sure you don't
rub your eyes.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.799
You gotta rinse your hands
and then scrub them
with vegetable oil.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.259
<i>Mami</i> taught you that?

14:03.259 --> 14:05.219
I guess.
How else would I know it?

14:05.219 --> 14:08.848
‐Maybe you're a natural.
‐(scoffs) Please.
I hate cooking.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.266
Sorry.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.396
No, I mean...

14:15.396 --> 14:16.606
this is fun.

14:18.149 --> 14:21.903
But cooking all the time
like <i>Mami</i> did? (scoffs)
Not interested.

14:21.903 --> 14:24.030
Even though she insisted on
teaching me.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.241
Bey and I'd be watching TV
in the other room.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.869
Usually one of those car shows
we were so into.

14:29.869 --> 14:33.247
And <i>Mami'd</i> call me in to
show me some dish she'd made.

14:34.082 --> 14:37.627
Bey, she let be her taster.
But me, she wanted to teach.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.088
Maybe she just wanted
to spend time with you.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.716
Nah. It's because I'm the girl.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.096
I'm the girl.
And I wanna learn.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.056
Who's gonna teach me?

14:52.809 --> 14:54.227
Go turn the kettle on.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.395
We need to soak these
in boiling hot water.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.730
(chuckles)

15:02.193 --> 15:05.238
‐(hits)
‐A shot of your
cheapest tequila, please.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.867
Um, I'm, I'm not
supposed to
serve drinks.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.411
Come on. My grandma's
making me give a toast,

15:12.411 --> 15:14.831
and I am not nearly
liquored up enough

15:14.831 --> 15:16.457
to wish the happy couple well.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.167
Are they really that bad?

15:18.167 --> 15:20.169
They texted me on Wednesday,

15:20.169 --> 15:22.130
not to tell me that they were
officially man and wife,

15:22.130 --> 15:25.341
but to make sure I wasn't
letting the newspapers pile up
on the driveway.

15:25.341 --> 15:28.594
‐Because that's just
an invitation for burglars.
‐Ah.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.180
Nice. I mean,
at least they were
thinking about you, right?

15:32.098 --> 15:34.976
Just one? Please, Beto?

15:36.978 --> 15:38.479
How do you know my name?

15:38.479 --> 15:39.981
I asked someone.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.944
Okay. How about this?

15:44.944 --> 15:48.281
You tell me yours,
and I'll give you a shot.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.992
I'm Ella.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.221
(coughs, then chuckles)

16:25.276 --> 16:26.861
‐(blows)
‐(swiping)

16:29.071 --> 16:30.656
Emilio?

16:32.116 --> 16:33.034
(chuckles)

16:34.076 --> 16:36.037
What are you doing here?

16:36.037 --> 16:38.039
Beto dug up my number.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.500
Look at you.
You look so...

16:41.500 --> 16:43.753
So, uh...

16:43.753 --> 16:45.046
Good?

16:45.046 --> 16:48.341
I was gonna say legal.
(chuckles)

16:50.134 --> 16:52.178
Let's be honest.
You always looked good.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.763
Even at 17.

16:54.639 --> 16:57.391
Oh, God. I had some
pathetic moves back then.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.645
And a girlfriend,
if I recall.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.271
Yeah.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.482
Believe me,
I was tempted, but...

17:04.482 --> 17:07.568
you were jail bait,
and the boss' son.

17:09.779 --> 17:13.532
Emilio Acosta.
You're all grown up.

17:15.368 --> 17:19.038
So, you want me
on general service?

17:21.582 --> 17:23.876
That would be great.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.879
Lauren De Sica.
Did you have to call
Lauren De Sica?

17:26.879 --> 17:28.256
What's wrong with Laur‐‐?

17:29.298 --> 17:32.927
‐Man, you two did it.
‐No. No.

17:32.927 --> 17:36.097
I mean, I tried.
Made a fool of myself trying.

17:36.097 --> 17:37.848
Well, how was I
supposed to know that?

17:37.848 --> 17:40.226
If I had limited myself to women
that you hadn't slept with

17:40.226 --> 17:43.145
or tried to sleep with,
I would've had no one to call.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.566
‐Want me to send her home?
‐No. No, we need the help.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.943
‐All right, get back to work.
‐Fine.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.988
Wh‐‐ hey,
do I have to put this on?

17:53.823 --> 17:55.533
What are these?

17:55.533 --> 17:58.077
Ms. McDonald wanted me
to pass 'em out for
dinner service.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.621
All right.
What's the problem?
Put it on.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.373
Isn't it kind of racist?

18:02.373 --> 18:04.834
What's racist about it?
It's a uniform.

18:04.834 --> 18:08.671
What, you don't think it's weird
that white people are asking us
to dress up in Mexican costumes?

18:08.671 --> 18:10.131
Well, now I'm
asking you to do it.

18:11.215 --> 18:15.261
Lots of restaurants
have their staff wear
stuff just like this.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.015
See? Looks fine.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.975
(chuckles)
You look like a tablecloth.

18:20.975 --> 18:23.561
Emilio! Emilio, it's Lupita.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.938
‐Oh, great. Okay, the tortilla
station needs to be set up‐‐
‐No, no, no.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.066
Her husband dropped off the van
with all the tortilla stuff,
but Lupita's in labor.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.568
They Ubered to the hospital.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.987
Okay.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.157
(exhales)

18:45.124 --> 18:47.084
It needs something.

18:47.084 --> 18:50.254
‐Oregano?
‐I can't tell.
It's different.

18:51.422 --> 18:55.051
‐It's different than <i>Mami's.</i>
‐It's not gonna be
exactly the same.

18:55.051 --> 18:58.179
I think it's better, Luce.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.099
It's not better.
How is it better?

19:02.099 --> 19:05.311
‐It's not an insult.
‐Well, I did it exactly
as she taught me.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.438
It's the same, or not as good.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.440
Valentina:
Why are you getting all mad?

19:15.196 --> 19:17.448
I'm not a cook, okay?

19:17.448 --> 19:20.910
What did I say?
I don't understand.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.579
(phone vibrating)

19:25.081 --> 19:27.166
Hey, Emilio.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.252
‐What? When?
‐What is it?

19:30.252 --> 19:32.296
He needs you to
fill in for Lupita.

19:32.296 --> 19:35.758
‐Right now?
‐You okay putting Rafa down?

19:35.758 --> 19:38.260
‐I guess.
‐Get the address.

19:44.725 --> 19:49.271
(mariachi music playing)

19:50.439 --> 19:51.607
(guitar tuning)

19:52.358 --> 19:56.153
Patty:
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Everybody! Everybody!

19:56.153 --> 20:00.199
The driver just texted me.
They are just turning
onto the street.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.326
I'm going to get them.
Lights out!

20:09.959 --> 20:11.961
‐Ooh! Sorry.
‐That's okay.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.839
Uh, we haven't met yet.
I'm Lauren.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.258
‐Vanessa.
‐You're Vanessa?

20:17.258 --> 20:18.843
Emilio's Vanessa?

20:20.177 --> 20:22.888
Well, yes.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.808
‐I cannot believe it.
‐Really? Why's‐‐ why's that?

20:25.808 --> 20:28.102
Well, back when I knew him,

20:28.102 --> 20:30.896
he just seemed so destined
to be, like, a player.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.149
Obviously, I read him wrong
if seven years later

20:33.149 --> 20:35.109
he's still with his
high school sweetheart.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.485
Oh, no. I'm‐‐

20:36.485 --> 20:38.070
I think you're thinking of
someone else.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.197
‐A different Vanessa?
‐Oh, shit.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.782
I'm sorry. I‐‐

20:41.782 --> 20:43.784
When I said "player,"
I was‐‐

20:43.784 --> 20:46.370
Oh, he was. Yes.
By all accounts,
he was, but...

20:46.370 --> 20:48.956
I'm, you know, I'm not even
his second Vanessa.
I'm his...

20:48.956 --> 20:50.708
‐third.
‐(Lauren chuckles)

21:04.930 --> 21:07.433
Patty: I don't know.
Pipe must have burst.
The...

21:07.433 --> 21:10.770
whole tennis court
is completely under water!

21:10.770 --> 21:13.022
‐(yells)
‐All: Surprise!

21:13.022 --> 21:16.609
(all cheering and clapping)

21:25.201 --> 21:26.660
Look at that.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.412
Now... (grunts)

21:28.412 --> 21:31.165
play.
(chuckles)

22:27.513 --> 22:30.724
Excuse me? This is not fine.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.394
‐That hat is not fine.
‐It's, it's a little gross,
okay?

22:33.394 --> 22:34.812
I can't exactly make a stink.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.480
Why would you
have to make a stink?

22:36.480 --> 22:39.149
Couldn't you simply just say,
"Um, excuse me, ma'am.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.485
I feel uncomfortable dressing up
like a Mexican bobble head."

22:41.485 --> 22:43.946
I don't need you to go all
social justice warrior on me,
okay, Lucía?

22:43.946 --> 22:45.865
‐I can't have a point of view?
‐Yes, you can have
a point of view.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.533
Just keep it to yourself.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.910
Look, if I mouth off
to that woman,

22:49.910 --> 22:53.122
I'm gonna blow the tip,
and no way will this lead
to anything bigger.

22:53.122 --> 22:56.125
These are rich people.
Connected people.

22:56.125 --> 22:59.086
We make a good impression
on them, and this could
lead to‐‐

22:59.086 --> 23:02.006
I, I don't even know what, okay?
Something better.

23:02.006 --> 23:04.216
Something bigger for all of us.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.927
And four of them have already
asked for my card.

23:06.927 --> 23:10.139
So more people want you to
go to their homes and play
"La Cucaracha"?

23:11.891 --> 23:13.767
Lupita's van is down the street.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.103
Can you move it to the driveway
and get the stuff out?

23:16.103 --> 23:18.147
We're already behind
on the tortillas.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.780
(dish clatters)

23:28.073 --> 23:30.034
You guys got coffee?

23:30.034 --> 23:32.620
I overdid it a touch
with the loosening up.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.164
Um, yeah. Give me a sec.

23:35.164 --> 23:38.167
I decided to talk about
how I found out
they were engaged.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.210
Via Wendy's Instagram story.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.504
It's funny,
'cause it was so bad.

23:42.504 --> 23:47.718
Just one blurry, dark photo
of a giant blood diamond.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.553
(chuckles)
Well, that'll probably kill.

23:49.553 --> 23:52.932
They didn't even invite me
to the wedding in Mexico.
Not that I wanted to go.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.268
Well, my parents are in Mexico
without me, too.

23:58.062 --> 23:59.313
(whispers):
Oh.

24:01.023 --> 24:04.151
Um, is there something
that you could say?

24:04.151 --> 24:06.445
About what they love
about each other?

24:06.445 --> 24:09.114
Money. Boobs.

24:09.114 --> 24:12.159
‐It's a tale as old as time.
‐Yeah.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.120
Do your parents love each other?

24:19.124 --> 24:20.042
How can you tell?

24:21.377 --> 24:24.964
Well, it's corny,
but they have this way
of holding hands.

24:25.673 --> 24:27.716
It's not like...

24:27.716 --> 24:29.134
It's like...

24:34.223 --> 24:36.058
I don't know.
They're always doing it.

24:36.058 --> 24:38.477
Reaching for each other's hands,

24:38.477 --> 24:42.898
whether they're happy
or sad or stressed.

24:44.108 --> 24:46.068
It's like they're
phone chargers.

24:46.068 --> 24:49.071
Have to be plugged
into each other
a few hours every day.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.950
You have an unsuspected depth

24:52.950 --> 24:55.536
for a man in a
ridiculous poncho.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.122
Thank you.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.006
(door opens)

25:10.884 --> 25:12.302
(door slams)

25:17.141 --> 25:18.306
‐(soft crash)
‐(car alarm wailing)

25:20.102 --> 25:21.645
(tapping on glass)

25:23.063 --> 25:25.232
Hey, sorry to interrupt,

25:25.232 --> 25:27.401
but let's give it up
for my Grandma Patty,

25:27.401 --> 25:28.986
who put all this together.

25:28.986 --> 25:32.114
(all clapping)

25:32.114 --> 25:37.077
So, I was thinking about
what to say about my dad
and Wendy.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.663
And...

25:39.663 --> 25:43.333
I remember the first time
I knew that they would
wind up together.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.961
Just by the way
they were holding hands.

25:47.171 --> 25:50.591
They didn't know
that I saw them.
But I did.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.803
And there's just something
so magical about holding hands.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.891
It's, you know, so intimate...

25:58.891 --> 26:01.018
Uh, the last dozen
are coming out right now.

26:01.018 --> 26:04.271
You're driving that big,
ugly van, right?

26:04.271 --> 26:06.732
‐Hmm?
‐The van.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.650
Out front.

26:08.650 --> 26:11.445
I watched you drive it
into the driveway.

26:11.445 --> 26:14.114
‐Oh, yeah.
‐We have a problem.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.996
‐Dan: Look at this!
‐No. No.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.041
How did this happen?

26:24.041 --> 26:26.251
You probably forgot to set
the parking brake.

26:26.251 --> 26:29.046
I need your license
and insurance.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.883
I'm gonna level with you.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.760
I don't have a license.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.346
I don't have insurance.
Uh, this isn't even my van.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.807
I'm just helping out because
the couple it belongs to

26:39.807 --> 26:41.600
is at the hospital right now
having a baby.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.894
Oh, that is very unfortunate.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.897
Actually, they've been
trying for a while,

26:46.897 --> 26:49.233
and we're very excited for them.

26:49.233 --> 26:53.487
But they can't be bothered now,
so we're gonna have to
work this out.

26:53.487 --> 26:56.240
I'll give you my number,
and when you figure out
what it's gonna cost

26:56.240 --> 26:58.367
‐to fix the bumper, you can‐‐
‐Yeah, I know what
it's gonna cost.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.620
It's $5,000.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.413
Here's the thing.

27:03.413 --> 27:06.125
There's no way
that's gonna cost $5,000.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.752
Really. Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you have, like, a‐‐

27:08.752 --> 27:12.005
an auto body
side job that you do?
Do you, honey?

27:12.005 --> 27:16.093
Because let me explain something
to you about the repair costs
on a classic Rover.

27:16.093 --> 27:18.512
You're thinking
I'm a girl, right?

27:18.512 --> 27:20.305
‐Aren't you?
‐No.

27:20.305 --> 27:23.267
I mean, you're thinking
because I'm a girl,
I don't know car stuff.

27:23.267 --> 27:26.478
‐Well, we know you can't drive.
‐That is not a classic
Range Rover.

27:26.478 --> 27:29.773
It's gotta be 15 years or older
to be a classic.

27:29.773 --> 27:32.150
And the actual
classic designation

27:32.150 --> 27:35.195
requires a low production run,
unique lines,

27:35.195 --> 27:37.030
and a well‐known body designer.

27:38.407 --> 27:41.743
Don't underestimate me because
I know how to make tortillas.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.579
If you can wait
till the end of the night,

27:43.579 --> 27:46.164
I'll get you $1,000 cash.

27:46.164 --> 27:49.167
A thousand dollars.
You know what?

27:49.167 --> 27:52.170
Why don't we just call the cops
and see what they say?

27:53.797 --> 27:56.133
And I could go back in there
and tell your friends

27:56.133 --> 27:58.802
that you called the police
on the caterer's kid sister

27:58.802 --> 28:01.430
because she refused
to let you gouge her.

28:05.642 --> 28:07.227
$1,500.

28:09.229 --> 28:12.441
$1,250. And you're still
gonna come out ahead.

28:17.446 --> 28:20.282
(phone ringing)

28:20.282 --> 28:22.451
<i>Mami,</i> check out what we made.

28:22.451 --> 28:23.744
Girl (over phone):
<i>Hello?</i>

28:23.744 --> 28:26.038
‐(lid clatters)
‐Who are you?

28:26.038 --> 28:29.499
<i>‐Who are you?</i>
‐I'm trying to call my mom.

28:29.499 --> 28:31.084
<i>You mean Glo?</i>

28:31.084 --> 28:33.837
<i>Oh, yeah. She's downstairs</i>
<i>making my dinner.</i>

28:33.837 --> 28:36.173
<i>Do you want me to</i>
<i>give her a message?</i>

28:37.090 --> 28:38.759
Why do you have her phone?

28:38.759 --> 28:40.594
Girl (over phone):
<i>Well, she was helping</i>
<i>with my math,</i>

28:40.594 --> 28:42.804
<i>and she left it on the charger</i>
<i>in my room.</i>

28:44.056 --> 28:46.183
She helps you
with your homework?

28:46.183 --> 28:48.644
<i>I mean, just math.</i>

28:48.644 --> 28:51.605
(laughs softly)
<i>Well, and Spanish,</i>
<i>obviously.</i>

28:51.605 --> 28:53.982
‐But why?
‐Girl (over phone):
<i>What do you mean, why?</i>

28:55.233 --> 28:57.819
<i>Okay. I'll just tell her</i>
<i>to call you.</i>

29:05.035 --> 29:07.329
Where is he? Point him out.
Maybe I can appeal to him‐‐

29:07.329 --> 29:10.374
I told you, I worked it out.
It could have been
so much worse.

29:10.374 --> 29:14.086
‐That's our tip.
‐Why do you think I
couldn't handle this, huh?

29:14.086 --> 29:16.880
I know how to argue with people.
It's one of my many skills.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.049
I mean, frankly, you should be
thanking me for not just saying,

29:19.049 --> 29:21.051
"Oh, yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

29:21.051 --> 29:23.929
‐How can I supplicate so as
not to upset you more?"
‐That's‐‐

29:25.180 --> 29:27.140
I wouldn't have
handled it that way, okay?

29:27.140 --> 29:30.727
Really? So you've gotten tired
of eating shit, have you?

29:45.117 --> 29:47.369
‐Hey.
‐Hi.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.330
That was a nice story.

29:50.330 --> 29:52.624
You catching them holding hands.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.544
Could have thought of that
without me.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.088
I saw them do it
under the table

29:58.088 --> 29:59.923
with my mom sitting
across from them.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.551
(exhales)

30:02.551 --> 30:06.763
Yeah, my mom actually
hired Wendy to redo
my dad's office.

30:06.763 --> 30:08.974
She was too busy
self‐medicating to realize

30:08.974 --> 30:11.810
Wendy's plan was to get rid
of more than just his sectional.

30:13.103 --> 30:16.481
‐Yeah, not a lot of people
to like in that story, huh?
‐(scoffs) No.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.276
My oblivious mom,
man‐opausal dad,

30:19.276 --> 30:21.987
gold‐digging stepmom, and...

30:21.987 --> 30:23.530
me.

30:24.531 --> 30:25.699
The...

30:27.200 --> 30:28.618
The what?

30:32.330 --> 30:35.125
‐What are you?
‐Honestly?

30:39.629 --> 30:41.048
I'm a mess.

30:46.720 --> 30:52.267
I just keep imagining
my mom right now,
in her shitty condo.

30:52.267 --> 30:55.103
Popping pills and
watching infomercials,

30:55.103 --> 30:57.481
so she doesn't have
to think about what's
going on over here.

30:58.565 --> 31:01.109
Is it wrong that I wanted them
to stay together

31:01.109 --> 31:02.986
even though
they hated each other?

31:04.154 --> 31:05.655
No.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.074
No, of course not.

31:08.909 --> 31:10.035
You know what would help?

31:11.286 --> 31:14.122
Would you... maybe...

31:16.416 --> 31:17.793
kiss me?

31:29.471 --> 31:33.600
‐Um, I should get back to work.
‐I'm still thinking about
my miserable family.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.233
‐Now?
‐Mm, slightly less.

31:45.237 --> 31:46.822
‐(thuds)
‐(gasping)

31:48.406 --> 31:49.908
Ella?

31:50.659 --> 31:52.244
What are you doing?

31:52.744 --> 31:55.205
‐Dad, I‐‐
‐Who is this kid?

31:55.205 --> 31:58.083
‐Uh, I'm sorry, sir.
My name is‐‐
‐I don't care what your name is.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.585
Now you're making out
with the help?

32:00.585 --> 32:02.295
(Ella sighs)

32:02.295 --> 32:05.465
‐I'm sorry, sir.
I shouldn't have‐‐
‐No, no. Don't apologize to him.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.678
Hey, what kind of business
are you running here?

32:09.678 --> 32:11.263
You condone this kind of thing
from your workers?

32:11.263 --> 32:14.099
Sir, I'm so sorry, okay?
This is completely
inappropriate,

32:14.099 --> 32:15.892
and Beto knows better.

32:15.892 --> 32:18.186
You're out of line.
Walk away.

32:20.147 --> 32:23.024
That's it?
You're not gonna fire him?

32:27.529 --> 32:30.198
Honey, let it go.
We have guests.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.118
‐Sir, he understands
that he overstepped.
‐Yes. I'm so sorry, sir.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.537
It'll never happen again,
so if you could just move
past this,

32:35.537 --> 32:38.707
‐I would greatly appreciate it.
‐I wanna see you fire him.

32:38.707 --> 32:41.334
Honey, please. Leave it alone.
Come back to the table.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.336
He's just a kid.

32:43.336 --> 32:46.089
‐He made a mistake.
‐Jim: I want to know you're
not just yessing me, here.

32:46.089 --> 32:49.176
That you're gonna make sure
he learns his lesson

32:49.176 --> 32:52.220
before you drop him back
on whatever street corner
you found him.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.346
(Wendy groans)

32:57.184 --> 32:58.310
All right.

32:59.561 --> 33:01.188
Pack it up. Party's over.

33:01.188 --> 33:03.273
Wait. What, what do you mean,
it's over? No.

33:03.273 --> 33:05.442
‐The invitation said eleven.
‐It's okay, Emilio.

33:05.442 --> 33:07.194
‐It is not okay.
‐Tell everyone in the kitchen,

33:07.194 --> 33:09.154
all equipment, all rentals,
we pack up in the driveway.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.615
Well, they certainly
can't expect a tip.

33:11.615 --> 33:13.408
Jim:
You really wanna
ruin this night?

33:13.408 --> 33:15.118
Walk away?

33:15.118 --> 33:16.995
That's the kind of professional
that you are?

33:18.079 --> 33:19.456
That's my brother.

33:22.584 --> 33:25.587
And as long as I'm around,
no one...

33:25.587 --> 33:27.714
no one...

33:27.714 --> 33:29.633
is gonna ever
talk to him like that.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.139
‐(clattering)
‐(bags rustling)

33:36.139 --> 33:38.725
(indistinct chatter)

33:41.603 --> 33:44.022
‐$1,250.
‐Thank you.

33:45.232 --> 33:47.150
Dan:
You drive a hard bargain.

33:48.235 --> 33:49.361
(taps)

33:49.361 --> 33:51.238
I'm a few minutes behind you.

33:51.238 --> 33:53.573
I gotta pack up Lupita's van.

33:53.573 --> 33:56.159
Gotta make sure it runs first,
but, uh...

33:56.159 --> 33:58.203
I'll see you at home.

33:58.203 --> 33:59.412
Emilio.

34:02.082 --> 34:05.710
‐It's okay, Bey.
‐Uh, sorry, I just, I‐‐

34:05.710 --> 34:08.046
I don't know what
I was thinking. I just‐‐
I really liked her.

34:08.046 --> 34:11.091
She seemed to like me,
and that my brain just
short‐circuited,

34:11.091 --> 34:12.050
and I'm sorry.

34:18.932 --> 34:21.935
Look, they paid what they owed.

34:21.935 --> 34:25.397
Okay? That includes the,
uh, staff, food, rentals...

34:25.397 --> 34:27.399
If we would have gotten than tip
we would have come out ahead,

34:27.399 --> 34:31.361
but the thing with the van,
and... (exhales)

34:31.361 --> 34:33.154
Truth is...

34:34.155 --> 34:35.365
we would have done better
at the restaurant,

34:35.365 --> 34:36.992
any night of the week.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.374
See you at home.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.342
He asked if I was
gonna be a lawyer,

34:54.342 --> 34:55.260
so that's something, huh?

34:55.260 --> 34:57.304
(scoffs)

35:03.977 --> 35:05.562
(clattering)

35:05.562 --> 35:08.273
Woo‐wee, are those people...

35:08.273 --> 35:10.108
assholes.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.573
Thanks for coming tonight.

35:16.573 --> 35:19.618
‐I'm sorry I couldn't offer you
more than just your hourly.
‐It's okay.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.580
It was entertaining.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.290
There's never a dull moment
around you.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.625
I forgot about that.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.628
You're always up for a fight.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.922
‐I was not.
‐With your dad.

35:32.922 --> 35:35.008
With your band mates.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.011
You and I fought, remember?

35:39.179 --> 35:41.306
‐Yeah.
‐I called you a skeeve

35:41.306 --> 35:42.724
for trying to cheat
on your girlfriend

35:42.724 --> 35:45.435
without a moment's hesitation.

35:45.435 --> 35:47.354
That I remember.

35:47.354 --> 35:48.563
Shit.

35:50.023 --> 35:53.151
You didn't care who or what
stood in your way. You just‐‐

35:55.487 --> 35:57.238
I don't think anyone
has ever wanted me

35:57.238 --> 35:59.449
as much as that
17‐year‐old boy did.

36:01.284 --> 36:06.581
I wish I could say my scruples
haven't changed in the last
seven years, but...

36:08.041 --> 36:11.461
A bad marriage will
make you feel like it's
every woman for herself.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.091
Is that terrible?

36:16.591 --> 36:18.051
It's flattering.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.012
But I can't.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.724
If you're offering.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.477
No.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.062
Not offering.

36:29.062 --> 36:31.690
It's just a test.
You passed.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.483
Congratulations.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.363
Guess the third
Vanessa's the charm, huh?

36:43.076 --> 36:45.537
‐(keys clank)
‐Val, we're home.

36:45.537 --> 36:48.790
‐What's that smell?
Smells like Christmas.
‐(laughs)

36:48.790 --> 36:51.126
Val and I were making menudo
when Emilio called.

36:53.086 --> 36:55.296
What is it? Is Rafa okay?

36:56.089 --> 36:59.134
I called <i>Mami</i> to show her
what we made.

36:59.134 --> 37:00.885
A girl answered.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.140
The girl she takes care of.

37:06.141 --> 37:08.351
Right. Well, that's her job.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.478
Valentina:
She's my age.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.188
And it's just her.

37:12.856 --> 37:15.525
She has <i>Mami</i> all to herself.

37:15.525 --> 37:18.027
I'm sorry. That's probably not
the best way to find out‐‐

37:18.027 --> 37:21.364
That girl has two mothers.
Two. And I don't even have one!

37:21.364 --> 37:24.659
‐You still have a mother.
‐Why did you leave me alone?

37:24.659 --> 37:27.579
I wouldn't have called her
if you'd been here.

37:27.579 --> 37:30.582
‐E‐Emilio needed me.
‐I needed you.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.793
We were having a good time,
and then the second
the phone rang,

37:33.793 --> 37:36.004
it's like you couldn't wait
to get out of here.

37:36.004 --> 37:38.339
It's hard to explain.

37:39.507 --> 37:42.010
It's not about not wanting
to spend time with you.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.137
It's about not wanting to be...

37:46.014 --> 37:47.515
<i>Mami.</i>

37:50.810 --> 37:53.188
I don't wanna be good
at the things that
she's good at,

37:53.188 --> 37:55.607
‐because what if that's
all I'm good at, and‐‐
‐(shushes)

37:55.607 --> 37:59.569
‐Hey. Come here.
(grunts) Shh.
‐(Valentina sobbing)

37:59.569 --> 38:01.321
(whispers):
It's okay.

38:01.321 --> 38:03.448
I know. It sucks. I know.

38:04.824 --> 38:05.742
(mouths)

38:06.910 --> 38:11.122
‐Come on. Come on, let's go.
‐(running footsteps)

38:17.045 --> 38:19.047
Don't beat yourself up.

38:19.047 --> 38:21.049
It seemed like
a good opportunity.

38:21.049 --> 38:23.426
You didn't know
it would turn out
the way it did.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.637
Funny thing is,

38:27.096 --> 38:29.516
my dad never served a meal
outside his restaurant.

38:29.516 --> 38:31.476
And I thought that
made him small‐time.

38:35.271 --> 38:38.233
Truth is, he didn't need
to walk out those doors

38:38.233 --> 38:40.735
to feel like some big shot.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.654
People came to him.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.572
On his terms.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.658
Not the other way around.

38:47.367 --> 38:49.536
Maybe that's the lesson.

38:49.536 --> 38:52.664
Make them come to you.
I mean, if it's a good business,

38:52.664 --> 38:55.500
‐it doesn't need to be more
than what it is right now.
‐That's just it.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.003
I do.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.800
I can't be just this.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.260
What, a restaurateur?

39:08.263 --> 39:10.098
Do you wanna rejoin your band?

39:13.685 --> 39:16.271
I wanna go back a week,

39:16.271 --> 39:19.774
to when I made you a promise
that I don't really think
I can keep.

39:24.279 --> 39:27.532
I don't wanna break up.
Okay? And‐‐

39:27.532 --> 39:29.576
I don't wanna see anyone else.

39:30.326 --> 39:33.204
Then what's the problem?

39:36.624 --> 39:38.710
One day I will.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.672
One day, I'm gonna want
to be with someone else.

39:45.091 --> 39:47.093
Wow.

39:47.093 --> 39:47.969
How do you know?

39:49.137 --> 39:52.056
Because I don't want everything
I have in this moment...

39:52.932 --> 39:54.601
to be everything
I'm ever gonna have.

39:57.186 --> 40:00.982
And I'm the only thing
that's optional.

40:03.192 --> 40:04.319
(scoffs)

40:07.530 --> 40:10.033
Can we just go back?

40:10.033 --> 40:11.826
To the way things were?

40:13.453 --> 40:17.081
Yeah, I‐I don't think
I'd like myself very much
if I agreed to that.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.962
So what are you thinking?

40:27.800 --> 40:29.552
I'm really gonna miss
your family.
