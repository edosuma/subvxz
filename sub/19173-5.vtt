00:16.149 --> 00:18.519
It's lost. For the moment,
Nassau town is lost.

00:18.619 --> 00:22.190
That much is painfully clear.
It is our duty now to secure
ourselves here.

00:22.290 --> 00:26.160
I think we're all properly
angry about what he did on
the Underhill estate,

00:26.260 --> 00:29.797
but Billy has influence
that is best not ignored.

00:29.897 --> 00:34.001
Billy told me I should worry
that you will be Madi's end.

00:34.102 --> 00:36.036
After you fled,
reprisals were visited

00:36.137 --> 00:38.672
upon our loved ones
upon the Edwards estate.

00:38.772 --> 00:41.109
I wonder, ma'am,
if he might want you to leave

00:41.209 --> 00:43.977
when he learns
of your current
state of being.

00:44.078 --> 00:46.780
She's flying
the governor's banner.
It's him!

00:46.880 --> 00:49.393
Ready the men.
We'll make our landing
under cover of the fort's guns,

00:49.417 --> 00:51.319
reinforce them,
and move to retake Nassau.

00:51.419 --> 00:54.588
I am prepared
to surrender the governor's
remaining forces to you,

00:54.688 --> 00:56.590
control of the fort, all of it,

00:56.690 --> 00:58.226
in exchange for the cache.

00:58.326 --> 01:00.328
No.
Trust me.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.274
Give me a hand with this chest.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.736
Where have you been?

03:55.836 --> 03:57.905
And where's Flint?

03:59.373 --> 04:01.409
In a moment,
a woman I don't know

04:01.509 --> 04:03.611
is going to walk
out of that fort.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.413
She's going to move
towards a longboat

04:05.513 --> 04:06.947
in which we'll have
placed two men

04:07.047 --> 04:09.383
to row her to
Governor Rogers' ship.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.028
We have ensured that
she'll arrive unharmed

04:12.052 --> 04:14.087
to deliver a message
to the governor.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.624
We ensured?

04:16.724 --> 04:18.692
I'm sorry.

04:18.791 --> 04:21.394
When and why
did we decide
to do that?

04:21.495 --> 04:23.431
Because Captain Flint
has offered himself

04:23.531 --> 04:27.335
as collateral
to Eleanor Guthrie
inside the fort.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.837
If we breach
our pledge,
he dies.

04:31.905 --> 04:34.375
Collateral?

04:34.475 --> 04:36.176
What the fuck
are you talking about?

04:36.344 --> 04:38.979
To guarantee our compliance...

04:40.548 --> 04:42.483
as part of a bargain
in which the British

04:42.583 --> 04:45.453
will be surrendering
their position in Nassau.

04:45.553 --> 04:48.789
Every man on the beach
will need to be told.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.860
Pass the word.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.628
Now.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.569
I would appreciate it
if you'd double check...

05:03.537 --> 05:05.038
...the transport.
Yes, ma'am.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.542
There are some supplies
that I would like to be
transported over, too.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.710
Thank you.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.514
Go and find
Mrs. Hannah.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.015
She'll know what to do.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.755
No one will harm you out there.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.524
How can you be so sure?

05:23.624 --> 05:27.595
Because they know if anything
happens to you, Flint dies.

05:27.695 --> 05:30.631
No one is going to test me
to see if I'm serious
about that.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.304
When you get to the ship,
when you get to him,

05:37.405 --> 05:39.006
you know what to say to him.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.841
Yes, ma'am.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.445
And you know
what not to say to him.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.548
If he balks about leaving,

05:47.648 --> 05:49.550
which he is
almost certain to do...

05:50.751 --> 05:52.019
it might help if he knew

05:52.119 --> 05:55.122
it wasn't just your welfare
that was in question.

05:55.222 --> 05:58.426
I won't have him
learning about it like this.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.794
I just won't.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.499
I understand.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.872
You should be going.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.930
Eleanor Guthrie...

07:10.030 --> 07:13.834
Eleanor Guthrie told you
she'd surrender the fort

07:13.934 --> 07:15.536
and all of Nassau with it

07:15.636 --> 07:19.172
if Flint agreed
to act as her hostage
to guarantee the deal?

07:22.510 --> 07:24.512
Are you really
gonna make me ask?

07:26.647 --> 07:28.749
It wasn't all she got.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.620
What else did she get?

07:32.720 --> 07:35.188
It was agreed

07:35.288 --> 07:37.357
that in addition to guaranteeing

07:37.525 --> 07:38.859
the safe departure
from the island

07:38.959 --> 07:40.861
of her and all her people...

07:42.162 --> 07:44.397
that we would retrieve
and surrender to her

07:44.532 --> 07:47.601
the cache of gems
remaining from the Urca gold.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.639
It guarantees a quick victory

07:51.739 --> 07:55.275
to a fight
we'd otherwise be far
from guaranteed to win.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.978
Guaranteed?

07:58.078 --> 08:00.548
When is anything ever...?

08:00.614 --> 08:03.116
And you agreed to this?
I didn't agree
to anything.

08:03.216 --> 08:06.654
The offer was
put to Captain Flint.
He had little time to decide.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.692
I trust his judgment.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.645
They're right in our path.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.217
What do you want to do?

08:43.289 --> 08:45.058
I have this.

08:45.158 --> 08:48.061
What the hell is this?

08:49.897 --> 08:53.634
Mrs. Rogers has asked me
to relay a message that is
of the utmost importance.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.803
I should certainly hope it is.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.606
She intends to
surrender her position.
What?

08:58.639 --> 09:00.974
She has negotiated
an arrangement with
Captain Flint

09:01.074 --> 09:04.912
in which he will
pay for this surrender
with the stolen cache of gems

09:05.012 --> 09:07.247
to secure your future together.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.449
She asks that you withdraw

09:09.617 --> 09:11.785
to allow for
this transaction to proceed,

09:11.885 --> 09:14.087
retire to Port Royal
for a fortnight

09:14.187 --> 09:15.623
and await her arrival.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.689
If she has not arrived...
Someone clear
that launch.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.268
Mr. Molin, get us underway.
We proceed.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.194
Prepare to make
our landing.
My lord.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.430
Prepare for landing!

09:27.935 --> 09:29.469
Is the governor
still approaching?

09:29.670 --> 09:31.204
He is, ma'am.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.651
If I wanted to fire
a warning shot,

09:43.684 --> 09:45.786
how close would I have to aim
for it to be effective?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.756
How close?

09:48.856 --> 09:51.258
I'm not interested
in holing his ship,

09:51.358 --> 09:53.794
but need him to understand
that I am committed to this.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.265
What's the distance to his ship?

09:58.365 --> 10:00.668
What's the distance
to the governor's ship?

10:00.768 --> 10:02.169
1,200 yards, approximately.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.937
Closing.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.642
I'd lead her
by two ship lengths.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.692
Continue our approach.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.934
Again, please.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.170
Ma'am.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.072
Again, please.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.276
Reload.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.280
I beg your pardon, my lord,

10:47.380 --> 10:50.150
but she demanded
that I relay what follows...

10:50.250 --> 10:52.352
her words precisely...

10:52.452 --> 10:54.922
in spite of any protest
you offered.

10:57.190 --> 11:00.794
She says she knows
that you will be angry

11:00.894 --> 11:04.297
and that this will be hard
for you to understand...

11:04.397 --> 11:06.299
...but she said...

11:17.244 --> 11:20.748
She said you should trust
that her commitment to you

11:20.848 --> 11:22.750
remains inviolable...

11:24.051 --> 11:26.286
and that this is no betrayal...

11:27.921 --> 11:30.057
but an act of love.

11:32.826 --> 11:36.263
And an act she is determined
to see through to its end.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.880
Mr. Molin.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.451
Come hard to starboard
and make your course
north-northwest.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.488
Sir?
Stand down
the gun crews.

12:06.026 --> 12:10.130
- Hard to starboard.
- Set course north-northwest.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.165
Stand down the gun crews.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.301
Set course
for north-northwest.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.882
Thank you.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.117
Are you all right?

13:05.185 --> 13:06.887
I am.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.992
What happened?

13:12.092 --> 13:14.461
I heard the governor
took Captain Teach's ship

13:14.561 --> 13:16.229
and threatened an invasion.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.399
Why now does he sail away?

13:20.667 --> 13:23.871
Flint just agreed
to trade the cache

13:23.937 --> 13:25.605
in exchange for
a complete surrender.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.675
To trade it?

13:28.876 --> 13:30.210
All of it?
All of it.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.112
The money that was
to be our treasury

13:32.212 --> 13:35.883
upon which the viability
of this entire enterprise
was premised.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.519
If this bargain consummates,
it will be gone.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.265
So much to give up.

13:59.406 --> 14:02.809
But I think he made
the right decision.

14:02.910 --> 14:06.213
Controlling Nassau
without the cache will
be a challenge,

14:06.313 --> 14:08.982
but one I don't think
can be avoided.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.419
You're kidding me!

14:13.520 --> 14:15.322
No.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.590
Are you kidding me?

14:23.663 --> 14:27.534
You did not see what I saw
at the Underhill estate.

14:27.634 --> 14:32.039
There has been immeasurable,
unspeakable suffering
on this island

14:32.139 --> 14:34.441
as a result of Billy's actions.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.109
Whatever trust may have been

14:36.209 --> 14:39.012
between the slaves here
and our alliance is gone.

14:39.112 --> 14:42.215
This enterprise is
on the verge of collapse

14:42.315 --> 14:45.385
and it cannot
withstand a fight against
the governor's men right now.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.588
What price
can be too high
to prevent it?

14:50.190 --> 14:52.960
Drastic measures
will need to be taken

14:53.026 --> 14:55.963
of which, I'm afraid,
this will only be the first.

14:55.996 --> 14:59.099
What is that supposed to mean?

14:59.199 --> 15:02.970
The damage done
to this alliance
was caused by Billy.

15:03.003 --> 15:06.806
It may be that the only way
to repair this damage

15:06.974 --> 15:09.576
is to remove
that which caused it.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.579
Remove him?

15:12.679 --> 15:14.982
It will be the only way
to regain the trust

15:15.048 --> 15:18.618
of those slave communities
uncertain about what this
alliance stands for.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.822
And you know as well as I

15:22.990 --> 15:25.858
Billy cannot exist alongside
Captain Flint for long.

15:25.993 --> 15:28.295
Sooner or later,
one or the other must go.

15:28.395 --> 15:31.064
If we win Nassau
even through surrender,

15:31.164 --> 15:33.233
we are still
going to have to control it.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.868
Without the resources
afforded by the cache

15:36.003 --> 15:38.005
or the force supplied
by Billy and his men,

15:38.071 --> 15:40.073
how the fuck do you imagine
we're going to do that?

15:40.173 --> 15:41.874
We will struggle through it,

15:42.009 --> 15:45.045
train men,
gain strength
through numbers,

15:45.145 --> 15:46.679
hunt for that which we need.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.916
It will be difficult.

15:50.017 --> 15:53.653
But since when did we expect
this would be anything else?

15:57.690 --> 15:59.559
What?

16:01.028 --> 16:02.695
Jesus.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.666
You sound exactly like him.

16:08.701 --> 16:11.271
Why is this a problem?

16:17.377 --> 16:19.879
Where are you going?

16:20.047 --> 16:23.450
I have a siege to manage,
for which I'm going to need
Billy's help.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.584
Wait!

16:28.688 --> 16:30.690
Billy was your friend.

16:32.125 --> 16:35.062
This is not easy for me,

16:35.162 --> 16:37.064
but I know it is harder for you.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.067
Please.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.269
Don't forget that I know that.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.510
I haven't.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.420
If this goes away,

17:00.520 --> 17:02.922
Flint's war,

17:03.090 --> 17:05.791
if it all ended
and we had to walk
away from it...

17:08.728 --> 17:10.663
Walk away?

17:13.333 --> 17:15.468
...would I be
enough for you?

17:21.141 --> 17:23.576
You know what?
You don't have
to answer that.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.547
We'll send Kofi
to retrieve the cache.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.582
Your mother will trust him.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.636
No news from outside the walls?

18:25.672 --> 18:29.209
A ketch was seen departing
the day before last.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.178
We were told it was sent
to retrieve the cache,

18:31.244 --> 18:32.512
but since then, nothing.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.456
He's dead, isn't he?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.459
Mr. Scott.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.800
Were you with him?

18:53.900 --> 18:57.404
I've heard about his role
amongst your maroon allies.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.209
Were you with him
before he died?

19:02.309 --> 19:05.111
I was.

19:05.212 --> 19:09.849
I've been told
that he departed the island
before all of this started.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.852
That he killed two soldiers
in the process.

19:12.952 --> 19:16.223
Everyone assumed he'd turned,

19:16.289 --> 19:18.325
that somehow one of you
had turned him,

19:18.425 --> 19:20.660
but that isn't
what happened, is it?

19:23.663 --> 19:26.599
No, it isn't.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.473
For how long had he been
secretly aiding them?

19:36.443 --> 19:39.779
He began, he said,
after the Spanish raid.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.651
Did he say why he did it?

19:44.751 --> 19:48.788
He told me that he feared
for the safety of his wife
and his daughter,

19:48.888 --> 19:52.925
so he had them transported
to a place they'd be safe.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.329
They weren't killed in the raid?

19:59.799 --> 20:01.401
Are they still alive?

20:03.202 --> 20:04.837
Yes, they are.

20:20.487 --> 20:23.690
For so long,
I thought I knew
what I was.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.296
A daughter
who usurped her father.

20:30.763 --> 20:34.267
A woman who
had taken control
of a wild place.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.308
Scott was proof of that.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.810
The one who saw me
that way, too,

20:43.910 --> 20:45.645
who substantiated it.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.983
And all that time,
all he saw was a girl
so ambitious...

20:52.552 --> 20:54.954
she would never doubt his story.

20:59.292 --> 21:02.529
So, she would continue
to play the part.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.334
Draw everyone's attention
away from himself.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.439
You did do all those things.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.441
I know I did.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.445
But always with a man behind me

21:18.545 --> 21:21.180
doing his damnedest
to bend it all to
his benefit.

21:22.682 --> 21:26.553
My father, Scott, Charles, you.

21:30.757 --> 21:33.526
So many goddamn men here.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.463
Too many goddamn men here.

21:36.563 --> 21:38.431
Woodes Rogers.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.669
He's really so different
from the rest of us?

22:18.405 --> 22:22.542
There's very little
I wouldn't do to
protect my wife.

22:26.413 --> 22:29.248
Of course, my lord.

22:29.416 --> 22:32.919
I had concerns when
we first arrived in Nassau,

22:33.019 --> 22:34.921
and I told her as much...

22:36.789 --> 22:41.794
that the instincts
that had allowed her
to survive for so long there,

22:41.894 --> 22:43.796
to thrive there,

22:43.896 --> 22:45.732
would eventually return.

22:47.500 --> 22:51.037
And that when they did,
it would cause conflict
between us.

22:52.972 --> 22:56.609
I don't believe that's
what's happened, my lord.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.449
You don't?

23:02.549 --> 23:05.452
She's done this
out of devotion to you.

23:06.619 --> 23:09.355
There's no doubt
in my mind about that.

23:09.456 --> 23:11.758
No, I don't doubt it either.

23:13.660 --> 23:16.295
I know she has no love for Flint

23:16.463 --> 23:18.631
nor any sympathy for his cause.

23:18.731 --> 23:22.802
I fear the instincts
that have awoken in her

23:22.902 --> 23:25.705
are more insidious than that.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.576
She has begun to believe again

23:29.676 --> 23:32.779
that disorder in Nassau
is inevitable,

23:32.879 --> 23:35.482
that civilization is powerless,

23:35.548 --> 23:37.717
either through lack of will

23:37.817 --> 23:40.520
or capacity
to do anything about it.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.996
Civilization

23:50.096 --> 23:52.965
has a number of faces.

23:54.734 --> 23:57.069
To think them all powerless

23:57.169 --> 23:59.205
to alter Nassau's future...

24:01.508 --> 24:03.510
is a terrible mistake.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.748
Yes?

24:10.583 --> 24:12.318
Harbor patrol is deploying.

24:12.519 --> 24:13.553
We've arrived.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.391
Harbor patrol?

24:19.526 --> 24:21.227
My lord, where are we?

24:27.834 --> 24:32.038
There is very little
I wouldn't do to
protect my wife.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.192
What the hell have you done?

24:56.896 --> 25:00.933
If the British Empire
will not aid us in fighting
our present enemy,

25:01.033 --> 25:03.135
perhaps a different empire will.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.438
Strike our colors.

25:06.573 --> 25:09.842
Raise the white flag
and make a course to
enter the harbor.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.578
Strike our colors!

25:11.678 --> 25:13.580
Raise the white flag!

25:13.646 --> 25:16.849
- Strike our colors!
- Raise the white flag!

25:59.626 --> 26:00.993
If they fire on us...

26:02.328 --> 26:04.964
we'll be sunk before
we get our gunports open.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.934
They won't fire on us.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.803
I beg your pardon, sir,

26:10.903 --> 26:12.705
but we're at war.

26:12.805 --> 26:15.742
Why wouldn't they?

26:15.842 --> 26:18.177
The most recognizable
British governor
in the New World

26:18.277 --> 26:20.146
is attempting to sail
a man-of-war

26:20.246 --> 26:22.915
requesting parley
into the port of Havana.

26:24.651 --> 26:27.119
If you were them,

26:27.219 --> 26:29.021
wouldn't you want to know why?

26:40.099 --> 26:42.234
Your contact?

26:42.334 --> 26:44.236
Juan Antonio Grandal.

26:44.336 --> 26:47.039
Colonial Intelligence.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.030
That's the Walrus.

28:20.066 --> 28:23.035
Everything we've put
that ship through...

28:24.236 --> 28:27.106
and she just refuses to die.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.779
It's fucking unnatural.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.189
They'll all follow you.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.358
You know that, don't you?

28:47.794 --> 28:49.154
Flint thinks
these people would run

28:49.195 --> 28:51.263
when confronted
by the governor's men.

28:52.799 --> 28:55.234
He's so convinced they won't
stand behind you and fight,

28:55.334 --> 28:58.004
he's ready
to hand over the cache
to avoid the outcome.

28:59.205 --> 29:01.073
And he's wrong.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.445
You're exactly
what I hoped you'd be.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.382
A rational man to lead Nassau.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.953
That's the first
in recent memory.

29:15.454 --> 29:18.157
And one that they'd
allow to lead them
into a rational future...

29:18.257 --> 29:21.460
This doesn't
have anything to do
with reason, and you know it.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.129
You want them following me

29:23.229 --> 29:27.233
only to the extent that
I, in turn, will follow you.

29:27.333 --> 29:32.038
I'm a convenience
designed to aid you
in ruling over Nassau

29:32.138 --> 29:35.107
with the same
uncompromising grip
you'd vilify from Flint.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.178
If I choose to side with him,

29:39.278 --> 29:41.280
trade the cache
for the fort and his life,

29:41.380 --> 29:43.850
are you
honestly suggesting
you'd let it happen?

29:43.916 --> 29:45.384
That you wouldn't use your men

29:45.484 --> 29:48.855
to force a scenario
by which he ends up dead?

29:50.857 --> 29:52.892
I'm not gonna stand by and watch

29:52.992 --> 29:54.660
while all our futures
are destroyed.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.395
No.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.900
But perhaps
it's worth focusing
on how hard I'm working

30:01.000 --> 30:04.003
to persuade you
not to make that decision.

30:04.103 --> 30:08.340
I would far, far
rather do this with you
than against you.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.810
And I have faith you can see
what is abundantly clear here.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.814
We have Nassau.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.985
We have a ship with which
to hunt and acquire more.

30:19.085 --> 30:21.765
And when that cache arrives,
we will have the money
to govern it all.

30:21.888 --> 30:24.123
We made a deal, Billy.

30:24.223 --> 30:28.027
We gave our word to MADI,
her mother, their people

30:28.127 --> 30:29.828
that we were all
committed to the same war.

30:29.929 --> 30:32.364
That's Flint's deal, not mine.

30:32.464 --> 30:35.001
And not yours.

30:35.101 --> 30:37.003
Their people need
a place to call home?

30:37.103 --> 30:38.270
Here it is.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.106
And we are contemplating
throwing it away

30:40.206 --> 30:44.977
to continue a war
that, sooner or later,
is guaranteed to end in defeat.

30:46.478 --> 30:49.215
You know I'm right.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.517
You know I'm right.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.362
Slow them down.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.564
The sooner that ship's afloat,

31:05.664 --> 31:07.066
the sooner
they'll all want to hunt,

31:07.166 --> 31:08.935
and we need them on the beach.

31:10.269 --> 31:11.603
Consider it done.

32:03.522 --> 32:05.992
I would like to be alone.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.197
All right.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.434
You'd like to be a part of this?

32:16.668 --> 32:18.670
What would you do?

32:31.183 --> 32:34.520
Sooner or later, that cache
is going to arrive,

32:34.620 --> 32:36.722
and there'll be
no more delaying.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.360
I'm committed to Flint.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.295
I'm committed to MADI.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.065
Yet the road
they intend to travel

32:46.165 --> 32:48.734
is one I'm losing
the ability to understand.

32:48.834 --> 32:52.671
I know what Billy's done...
what should be unforgivable...

32:52.771 --> 32:54.873
and yet till so very recently,

32:55.041 --> 32:58.410
there's no one in the world
I called a closer friend.

33:02.048 --> 33:05.251
The more he talks,
the more I remember why.

33:11.590 --> 33:14.526
To turn on him now,

33:14.626 --> 33:19.065
to have him killed...
which is what it would take
to side with Flint...

33:22.734 --> 33:25.071
seems like something

33:25.104 --> 33:27.373
I don't know
I have it in me to do.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.677
You don't know, hmm?

33:33.445 --> 33:34.445
You don't know?

33:36.182 --> 33:38.617
Why should I follow you
if you don't know?

33:38.717 --> 33:41.453
Why would anyone?

33:41.553 --> 33:44.723
I don't give a shit
what goes on in there.

33:44.823 --> 33:47.193
Fuck Flint.
Don't fuck Flint.

33:47.293 --> 33:49.395
Fuck Billy.
Don't fuck Billy.

33:49.495 --> 33:50.962
I don't give a shit
what you choose,

33:51.163 --> 33:52.998
but fucking choose!

33:53.099 --> 33:55.334
And don't make me
suffer the thinking.

33:57.503 --> 33:59.538
Worry ain't a good look
for a king,

33:59.638 --> 34:02.408
not in a kingdom like this

34:02.508 --> 34:06.112
where loyalty
is in short supply.

35:29.428 --> 35:32.531
Did you counsel him
to come here?
No.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.601
But the urgency
of his situation
demanded it.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.908
It was a mistake.

36:13.739 --> 36:15.541
Inglés?

36:23.282 --> 36:26.252
I think you know who I am.

36:26.318 --> 36:29.255
I think you know what I am.

36:31.923 --> 36:35.527
You and I are enemies
as our kings are at war
with one another.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.297
But their war...

36:40.332 --> 36:42.968
right now their war
is meaningless to me.

36:45.337 --> 36:49.107
I came to Nassau
before it began to
foster commerce,

36:49.275 --> 36:52.478
and toward that end,
to combat piracy,
to defeat it.

36:52.578 --> 36:55.381
That was my war.

36:55.481 --> 36:58.484
And I had that victory
within my reach.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.620
I had it.

37:03.689 --> 37:06.592
But my enemy has
remade itself since then,

37:06.692 --> 37:09.795
made allies with
an army of maroons,

37:09.895 --> 37:13.932
and has now dedicated itself to
disorder of the grandest scale.

37:14.032 --> 37:17.168
Inciting others...
slaves, sailors,

37:17.303 --> 37:19.137
wage laborers alike...

37:19.305 --> 37:21.307
to join their fight
and give their lives

37:21.407 --> 37:24.443
to destroy the civilized world.

37:25.511 --> 37:28.314
Labor fuels commerce

37:28.414 --> 37:30.949
and commerce fuels security.

37:31.049 --> 37:35.186
If these people
are successful in
compromising the first,

37:35.321 --> 37:38.890
there is
no end to the damage
they can cause the rest.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.328
In this war...

37:43.562 --> 37:46.164
you and I have far more
that unites our interests

37:46.332 --> 37:47.933
than separates them.

37:49.335 --> 37:52.170
For if Nassau falls,

37:52.338 --> 37:53.939
if it becomes a dark symbol

37:54.039 --> 37:57.409
of what mayhem
these men can unleash,

37:57.509 --> 38:00.812
a rallying cry
that might be heard
throughout the New World...

38:02.914 --> 38:06.217
how long
before these same men
turn their eyes to Cuba?

38:06.352 --> 38:09.355
To your plantations
and your ships?

38:09.421 --> 38:13.592
How long before
Spanish slaves are
emboldened by it

38:13.692 --> 38:17.228
and set their eyes on you?

38:17.363 --> 38:20.666
When you are forced
to write to King Philip,

38:20.766 --> 38:22.601
begging his assistance

38:22.701 --> 38:26.705
in staving off the army
of slaves and pirates
on your doorstep...

38:28.139 --> 38:31.410
would you not wish
in that moment

38:31.510 --> 38:34.480
that you had this one back

38:34.580 --> 38:38.384
when it was possible
to kill this monster
in its cradle...

38:40.051 --> 38:44.390
cheap and quick and quiet?

38:53.399 --> 38:56.468
I had a younger brother once.

38:56.568 --> 38:58.404
Simón.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.240
He was a midshipman

39:02.408 --> 39:04.743
aboard Nuestra Señora
de la Encarnación.

39:06.612 --> 39:11.116
Beneath a flag of surrender,
he was butchered.

39:11.417 --> 39:12.684
And I'm told

39:12.784 --> 39:17.255
you likely wielded the sword

39:17.489 --> 39:18.890
personally.

39:20.426 --> 39:22.461
Am I misinformed?

39:23.895 --> 39:25.497
No.

39:29.435 --> 39:31.537
You are not my enemy

39:31.637 --> 39:34.105
because my king tells me so.

39:36.475 --> 39:41.447
Don't insult me
by suggesting otherwise.

39:47.519 --> 39:51.823
If the situation in Nassau
is as you say it is,

39:51.923 --> 39:54.793
why are you here?

39:54.893 --> 39:58.864
Why are you not
in Williamsburg or Kingston

39:58.964 --> 40:00.732
seeking help from your own?

40:00.832 --> 40:02.000
I've tried.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.102
They won't listen.

40:05.837 --> 40:10.075
Maybe because they care more
about the war against Spain
than I do.

40:11.543 --> 40:13.912
Maybe because this just
isn't as personal to them

40:14.012 --> 40:15.847
as it is for me or for you.

40:15.947 --> 40:18.484
This is personal to me?

40:18.584 --> 40:19.985
Of course it is.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.788
The pirates offered me
a cache of stolen gems

40:22.888 --> 40:25.857
to persuade me to surrender.

40:25.957 --> 40:28.827
The cache of gems
representing the last
remaining share

40:28.927 --> 40:31.129
of the Urca plunder.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.435
They're paying
for their war with
your money.

40:48.446 --> 40:51.650
What is it you think
will come from this?

40:51.750 --> 40:55.153
You think I'll commit men
and sail with you?

40:55.253 --> 40:58.890
To fight an insurgency
on your territory,

40:58.990 --> 41:03.194
force my men to decipher
friend from enemy

41:03.294 --> 41:05.931
amongst that sort of confusion?

41:08.199 --> 41:11.670
My friends
are all besieged
within Fort Nassau.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.140
My wife is there.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.709
I'd beg you to spare them,

41:17.809 --> 41:19.611
avoid the fort entirely.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.212
And in exchange,

41:21.312 --> 41:23.982
the fort will offer
no resistance to
your landing.

41:24.082 --> 41:26.017
Once you land,

41:26.117 --> 41:28.987
once you are past the fort...

41:30.221 --> 41:32.858
I envision no confusion.

41:34.292 --> 41:36.728
You needn't decipher anything.

41:38.864 --> 41:42.568
I'd simply ask
that you burn it all
to the ground.

41:59.217 --> 42:01.086
The ship was spotted
on the horizon,

42:01.186 --> 42:03.421
approaching
the rendezvous beach
from the south

42:03.622 --> 42:04.990
and flying no colors.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.058
Kofi and his men are returning.

42:07.158 --> 42:09.160
The wind is dying out.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.630
The cache will be on the sand
in a few hours, at most.

42:16.234 --> 42:17.903
Who knows they've arrived?

42:18.003 --> 42:19.705
So far?

42:19.805 --> 42:23.609
Him, you, and I.
That's it.

42:23.675 --> 42:26.645
Sooner or later,
people are going to know.

42:26.745 --> 42:27.922
And we're gonna have to
give them instructions

42:27.946 --> 42:30.649
about what happens
to that cache once it lands.

42:31.817 --> 42:34.085
There's no more
putting off a decision.

42:36.121 --> 42:39.224
Giving up that money
is an impossibility.

42:41.159 --> 42:43.962
Flint will just keep pushing
for these things,

42:44.062 --> 42:47.265
costly things that we pay for
with our own suffering,

42:47.365 --> 42:48.700
with our own lives.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.636
You know this.

42:51.703 --> 42:53.672
You've always known this.

42:55.707 --> 42:58.109
Sooner or later, it has to end.

43:00.946 --> 43:03.982
You send word to the fort
and tell them it's here.

43:04.082 --> 43:07.085
Arrange for them to come out.
I'll have men waiting there.

43:08.186 --> 43:09.921
I'll end it quickly.

43:12.658 --> 43:16.995
All you have to do
is look the other way.

43:23.034 --> 43:26.071
I don't want it happening
in full view of that beach.

43:35.013 --> 43:36.381
Yeah.

43:53.932 --> 43:55.701
What was that?

44:40.278 --> 44:42.013
It's arrived.

44:42.113 --> 44:43.882
The cache?

44:46.484 --> 44:48.754
What else does it say?

44:51.757 --> 44:53.992
It's across the island.

44:54.092 --> 44:57.162
Mr. Silver insists
that we exit through
the northwest tunnel

44:57.262 --> 45:00.866
where we'll
be escorted over land
to the southern coast.

45:00.966 --> 45:02.968
The transport
will meet us there.

45:09.140 --> 45:11.843
This wasn't part of the deal.

45:14.445 --> 45:18.049
Sailing a fortune in jewels
into that harbor

45:18.149 --> 45:21.419
in full view
of a beach filled
with enraged pirates,

45:21.519 --> 45:23.388
you can understand
his reluctance.

45:24.790 --> 45:27.158
This way, there will be
far less risk

45:27.258 --> 45:29.995
of anyone disturbing
the exchange.

45:30.095 --> 45:33.431
I saw his face
when you accepted this deal,
and I imagine you did, too.

45:33.531 --> 45:35.166
If there is anyone on that beach

45:35.266 --> 45:37.635
with a desire to disrupt
this exchange,

45:37.803 --> 45:40.238
I'm concerned Mr. Silver
may be first among them.

45:41.807 --> 45:44.009
I'm not concerned.

45:49.547 --> 45:51.316
Lieutenant Utley.

45:51.416 --> 45:53.819
Select six of your men
to escort us.

45:53.919 --> 45:56.287
Mr. SOAMES is in charge
until I return.

46:54.479 --> 46:56.147
The men are all in position?

46:57.883 --> 46:59.250
They are.

47:00.685 --> 47:03.889
About a dozen of them
beyond that tree line.

47:06.091 --> 47:08.759
Once Silver gives the signal,

47:08.960 --> 47:11.429
they'll close in.

47:24.142 --> 47:25.911
They'll have soldiers with them.

47:26.011 --> 47:28.914
Tell Silver it's important
we wait until they've all
cleared the tunnel

47:28.947 --> 47:30.916
before we make any kind of move.

47:31.917 --> 47:32.918
When the time comes,

47:32.951 --> 47:34.920
I don't want anyone else
touching Flint.

47:36.121 --> 47:37.555
I'll handle it.

47:56.041 --> 47:57.442
This isn't right.

48:01.046 --> 48:04.315
All those men out there
that you and I have
fought alongside.

48:06.051 --> 48:09.554
I can't believe
I'm the only one
who knows this isn't right.

48:54.699 --> 48:57.202
You built all of this.

48:59.404 --> 49:01.206
The resistance.

49:02.473 --> 49:04.475
It wouldn't have worked
without you.

49:07.312 --> 49:11.082
But part of what you built,
it worked too well.

49:15.753 --> 49:18.056
Long John Silver.

49:20.025 --> 49:23.328
All he had to do
was open his mouth,

49:23.428 --> 49:25.530
say your name,

49:25.630 --> 49:27.732
and everyone listened.

49:31.669 --> 49:34.139
What was it
that he said about me?

49:36.374 --> 49:37.934
He said the reason Flint's fleet

49:38.043 --> 49:40.078
never got warning
of the barricade
in the harbor

49:40.178 --> 49:42.547
wasn't because
Mr. Featherstone
didn't relay it...

49:45.383 --> 49:47.752
wasn't because Max
intercepted it.

49:50.488 --> 49:54.292
He said it was
because you never
sent it in the first place.

49:55.726 --> 49:57.528
And they all believed him.

50:00.331 --> 50:03.968
I don't think anyone
actually believed it.

50:04.069 --> 50:07.538
You weren't indicted
based on the facts,

50:07.638 --> 50:10.007
or our suspicions
of your motives.

50:11.209 --> 50:13.411
He just said it.

50:14.845 --> 50:17.348
Only, no one had
the balls to defy him.

50:19.484 --> 50:21.152
I told them

50:21.252 --> 50:23.388
I should be the one to do it.

50:24.622 --> 50:26.557
If it was gonna happen,

50:26.657 --> 50:28.726
I thought it should be a friend.

50:35.600 --> 50:37.335
But fuck it.

50:38.403 --> 50:40.738
I won't do it.

50:50.215 --> 50:52.317
You've all forgotten your oaths.

50:56.121 --> 50:58.022
They were given to this man

50:58.123 --> 51:00.458
when that man
was just a fiction.

51:02.460 --> 51:05.263
To hell with all of you
who can't tell the difference!

51:07.498 --> 51:09.200
To hell with all of you!

51:41.299 --> 51:43.168
Stop!

51:58.649 --> 52:01.186
Take him
to the Underhill estate.

52:05.223 --> 52:07.192
Do it.

52:31.816 --> 52:34.319
Captain?

52:38.489 --> 52:41.058
Is the cache on the sand yet?

52:41.259 --> 52:42.727
The cache isn't here.

52:42.827 --> 52:45.230
What the fuck is this?

52:47.432 --> 52:49.234
I don't know.

52:53.538 --> 52:55.706
Stand down.
Just wait!

53:19.530 --> 53:20.765
What are you doing here?

53:22.032 --> 53:24.101
We escaped the governor's men.

53:24.269 --> 53:26.737
Came back to rejoin the fight,

53:26.837 --> 53:30.275
but didn't know
if the harbor was
safe to enter.

53:30.375 --> 53:32.277
What are you doing here?

53:50.928 --> 53:52.963
You want to trade it?

53:53.063 --> 53:56.667
You want to trade
the cache, my cache?

53:56.767 --> 54:01.672
It was the only way
we could avoid a fight we were
more than likely to lose.

54:01.772 --> 54:05.009
And it guarantees us
control of the island
today and for certain.

54:05.109 --> 54:07.412
All it guarantees
is we no longer
have the cache

54:07.512 --> 54:09.947
that we all agreed was critical.

54:10.047 --> 54:11.181
And who decided this?

54:11.382 --> 54:13.918
You and Mr. Silver?

54:20.325 --> 54:21.692
Ah.

54:22.927 --> 54:24.495
It won't work.
It's done.

54:24.595 --> 54:26.096
It's already agreed to.

54:26.331 --> 54:28.333
She agreed to it.

54:29.867 --> 54:31.101
Her people agreed.

54:31.336 --> 54:32.770
You've agreed.

54:32.870 --> 54:34.339
But it's all meaningless

54:34.439 --> 54:38.576
unless and until he agrees.

54:38.676 --> 54:39.744
Woodes Rogers.

54:39.844 --> 54:43.648
He left the island
for Port Royal
as she asked

54:43.748 --> 54:45.350
to await her arrival
with the money.

54:45.450 --> 54:46.817
He's already agreed to it.

54:46.917 --> 54:49.354
No, he hasn't.

54:52.490 --> 54:54.191
What is it?

54:54.359 --> 54:55.893
What do you see out there?

55:07.037 --> 55:11.376
I watched him
defeat Edward Teach
in battle...

55:12.377 --> 55:14.379
outnumbered

55:14.479 --> 55:16.847
and through sheer force of will.

55:16.947 --> 55:20.385
I saw his bloodlust
with my own eyes.

55:20.485 --> 55:25.390
That man will never
surrender his position here.

55:25.490 --> 55:28.426
He will never allow himself
to be defeated by you or I.

55:28.526 --> 55:29.827
Not because we bribed him,

55:29.927 --> 55:32.497
not because
Eleanor Guthrie
told him so.

55:32.597 --> 55:36.467
He simply will not
allow it to happen.

55:40.471 --> 55:42.507
I don't know where that man went

55:42.607 --> 55:45.009
or what designs drew him there,

55:45.109 --> 55:46.544
but this I know...

55:46.644 --> 55:48.413
Woodes Rogers
will be returning...

55:51.916 --> 55:54.184
and this fight
isn't nearly over.
