00:15.787 --> 00:18.476
Previously on Powers...

00:18.567 --> 00:20.566
You took back your powers from me.

00:21.339 --> 00:23.339
Didn't it feel good?

00:23.717 --> 00:25.238
Don't you wanna feel like that again?

00:25.246 --> 00:28.390
It's branding. You know, the connections
between the words "Kaotic Chic"

00:28.413 --> 00:29.995
and the fucked-up shit Powers do.

00:31.745 --> 00:34.370
We're supposed to be talking
about the launch of my foundation.

00:34.495 --> 00:36.784
Whose mission is to transform
young girls into leaders.

00:36.785 --> 00:39.828
Why not bring Zora on as the
foundation's first mentor?

00:39.953 --> 00:41.245
You were right.

00:41.370 --> 00:42.784
This is our movement.

00:42.785 --> 00:45.245
We should do whatever
we can to help it grow.

00:45.412 --> 00:46.784
I'm really glad you said that.

00:46.785 --> 00:48.784
Because, actually, I'm here already.

00:48.785 --> 00:54.784
I feel a vast reservoir of power.

00:54.785 --> 00:57.161
Sway. What a wonderful name.

00:57.287 --> 01:03.203
And he shall have sway and
dominion over all the world.

01:03.328 --> 01:05.785
Allow me to introduce you
to the effects of Sway.

01:05.786 --> 01:09.784
The reward for anyone without
powers is instant death.

01:09.785 --> 01:11.784
What the fuck have you done, man?

01:11.785 --> 01:13.784
Don't you fucking run away from this again!

01:13.785 --> 01:15.785
I wouldn't dream of it.

01:19.527 --> 01:20.899
All right.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.899
Now, I know it's a little small,

01:22.900 --> 01:25.900
but it was the only available
penthouse in the city.

01:27.900 --> 01:28.900
So?

01:33.900 --> 01:35.340
I had a decorator pick that shit out.

01:35.900 --> 01:36.899
Pretty nice, right?

01:36.900 --> 01:38.899
Yeah, real nice,

01:38.900 --> 01:41.900
if you're into bullshit
bourgeois knickknacks.

01:43.193 --> 01:44.899
Look...

01:44.900 --> 01:46.899
Look, man, I'm just curious.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.900
How long are you planning
on staying pissed at me?

01:50.900 --> 01:51.900
Who says I'm pissed?

01:52.900 --> 01:54.899
I mean, I like that.

01:54.900 --> 01:57.899
Hey, you want it? It's yours.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.899
I mean, shit, I can probably
get them to send me a new one.

01:59.900 --> 02:01.899
Probably even bigger.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.693
Thanks. No.

02:05.900 --> 02:06.900
All right, man.

02:07.900 --> 02:08.900
Come on.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.899
Check this out.

02:11.900 --> 02:15.900
Come on, even Johnny Royalle
has got to approve of this view.

02:19.900 --> 02:20.900
- Not bad.
- Right?

02:23.485 --> 02:24.900
Dude. You should move in here.

02:26.777 --> 02:27.899
The fuck are you talking about?

02:27.900 --> 02:28.899
It's perfect.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.899
It'll be like when we
roomed together at the squat.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.899
Only now, we've got all this shit.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.899
Dude, think about it. The
parties will be insane.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.899
Only the coolest people will be there.

02:38.900 --> 02:42.900
Movie stars, Powers and fucking rock bands.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.318
Nah, I can't.

02:45.443 --> 02:48.899
Come on, Johnny. Why
not? This will be perfect.

02:48.900 --> 02:49.899
Look, if it's money you're worried about,

02:49.900 --> 02:52.900
- I got you covered, all right?
- I'm not your charity case.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.899
What the hell is wrong with you, huh?

02:55.900 --> 02:57.899
This is everything we've ever wanted, man!

02:57.900 --> 03:01.900
It's not mine! Okay? It's yours. Your life.

03:04.819 --> 03:05.984
I don't...

03:06.110 --> 03:08.900
I don't know if I even want this anymore.

03:14.901 --> 03:17.899
It's a long fucking
way down to that street.

03:17.900 --> 03:20.899
160, 180 feet, easy.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.485
Then it's a good thing you can fly.

03:22.610 --> 03:23.900
And what if I don't?

03:24.610 --> 03:25.899
Fly.

03:25.900 --> 03:29.899
I'm gonna fall, and you're
gonna teleport me over there.

03:29.900 --> 03:33.777
That's crazy. I mean, I can
barely teleport two people,

03:33.900 --> 03:35.899
let alone two people falling in midair.

03:35.900 --> 03:39.899
Johnny, "Only in extremity
do you find your true limits."

03:39.900 --> 03:41.900
This isn't extremity, this is a show.

03:41.984 --> 03:44.151
It's all a fucking show, Johnny.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.900
Maybe it is, but that's
not how I want to do it.

03:48.901 --> 03:50.900
Fine, don't save me.

03:53.900 --> 03:54.899
Hey, Johnny.

03:54.900 --> 03:55.901
What?

03:56.068 --> 03:58.610
I know I can count on you, pal.

03:59.900 --> 04:01.360
Shit!

04:03.900 --> 04:04.900
Shit...

04:11.900 --> 04:14.899
You stupid, fucking
idiot. Why didn't you fly?

04:14.900 --> 04:16.899
You could have died.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.899
Shit, we both could have died.

04:19.899 --> 04:20.899
You fucking did it, man.

04:20.899 --> 04:24.900
Johnny fucking Royalle,
you did it, pal. I knew it.

04:25.193 --> 04:26.899
I knew you could do it, man.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.900
Come here.

04:30.900 --> 04:31.900
Shit.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.899
You okay?

04:37.900 --> 04:39.940
It's been a while since
you've taken a ride with me.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.899
Nice place.

04:44.900 --> 04:47.276
You decorate it yourself?

04:47.402 --> 04:51.899
I lost my taste for
extravagances a long time ago.

04:51.900 --> 04:55.151
Strip away the external
to discover the eternal.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.899
For someone who hates Wolfe so much,

04:58.900 --> 05:02.485
you're a regular compendium of his words.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.140
What did he say to you, Johnny?

05:06.900 --> 05:08.485
God damn it.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.777
Hey.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.900
What did he say to you?

05:16.402 --> 05:17.900
Jesus, Christian.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.402
Try to think for a minute,

05:20.527 --> 05:23.899
you can't just charge through
a wall to get to the next room.

05:23.900 --> 05:24.900
Yeah, okay.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.568
Okay, man, I...

05:27.693 --> 05:28.900
I just...

05:55.568 --> 05:59.899
Whenever I come here, I
teleport with me a volume of air.

05:59.900 --> 06:03.899
I don't usually remove
it when I go, but I can.

06:03.900 --> 06:05.860
Fuck you.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.900
Fuck you and your sick tricks.

06:09.900 --> 06:12.900
No tricks this time, old friend.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.900
I need your help.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.900
I need your help to kill Wolfe.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.900
Allow me to explain.

"Only in extremity can
you find your true limits."

07:54.900 --> 07:56.900
You made this shit from Wolfe's blood?

07:57.900 --> 08:00.110
I made it from components of his DNA

08:00.235 --> 08:02.900
that I teleported from his blood.

08:03.900 --> 08:04.984
Oh, God.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.899
You fall for his bullshit, again and again.

08:07.900 --> 08:09.900
I didn't do this for him.

08:11.900 --> 08:12.900
I did it for the Kidz.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.899
The ones like our friends

08:15.900 --> 08:17.899
who couldn't save themselves from him.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.899
Really, the Kidz? The
Kidz you want to save?

08:20.900 --> 08:21.899
They're dying.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.899
They're turning up dead with your drug,

08:24.900 --> 08:27.899
Wolfe's blood, still in them.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.652
It's not the Sway that's killing them.

08:32.652 --> 08:33.899
They're trying to do things

08:33.900 --> 08:34.899
they don't have the discipline to achieve.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.899
Oh, fuck. Now you sound like him.

08:36.900 --> 08:41.900
"Powers Complete requires
discipline that equals potential."

08:43.402 --> 08:44.900
You don't want to kill Wolfe.

08:46.900 --> 08:48.735
You want to replace him.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.899
You want to be Wolfe so bad,

08:51.900 --> 08:54.610
you stuck a fucking needle into his brain

08:54.735 --> 08:56.900
and turned his blood into a drug.

09:00.900 --> 09:01.900
And you took that drug

09:02.900 --> 09:04.900
to try and get your powers back.

09:07.900 --> 09:08.899
I was there.

09:08.900 --> 09:11.900
I saw you with your eyes all lit up.

09:36.900 --> 09:38.235
The hell are you doing?

09:39.900 --> 09:40.900
I know for sure now.

09:41.900 --> 09:42.899
I have powers.

09:42.900 --> 09:47.527
And, by way of powers,
what exactly do you have?

09:47.693 --> 09:48.899
I know you won't shoot me if I run.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.899
I know I'll chase the shit out of you.

09:50.900 --> 09:51.899
Maybe I have super speed.

09:51.900 --> 09:53.693
Maybe I'll shoot you in the leg.

09:53.860 --> 09:54.899
Maybe I'm bulletproof.

09:54.900 --> 09:56.899
Your dad bulletproof?

09:56.900 --> 09:58.899
How do you know about my dad?

09:58.900 --> 10:00.899
Court family records.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.899
Have a lot to say about how your
dad treated you and your mom.

10:03.900 --> 10:04.900
Don't talk about my mom.

10:05.900 --> 10:06.900
Uh, Calista.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.899
- You should be afraid of me.
- Yeah?

10:10.900 --> 10:12.899
Mmm. Why is that?

10:12.900 --> 10:14.527
I took Sway,

10:14.900 --> 10:16.899
and it didn't kill me.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.899
I'm a Power. For real.

10:18.900 --> 10:19.899
You push me far enough,

10:19.900 --> 10:22.900
that may be just what
it takes to switch me on.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.900
Not again.

10:41.900 --> 10:42.900
Not again.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.900
Oh, not again, not again, not again.

10:46.900 --> 10:47.900
Oh, shit.

10:48.900 --> 10:49.900
Oh, shit.

10:51.900 --> 10:52.900
Not again.

10:53.900 --> 10:55.899
Did you see before?

10:55.900 --> 10:57.900
Did you see what happened?

10:59.900 --> 11:01.899
It worked, Johnny.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.900
I got my powers back from him.

11:04.900 --> 11:05.900
They weren't yours.

11:05.901 --> 11:07.899
No, they were.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.900
I confirmed it with him and they were.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.360
That's what he said, did
he, when you visited him?

11:13.485 --> 11:14.900
Yeah. Yeah.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.899
Christ, Christian.

11:17.900 --> 11:21.110
You fall for his bullshit,
again and again and again.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.984
Just like me.

11:24.110 --> 11:27.899
No. No, dude. I flew.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.568
I threw him through the floor.

11:29.693 --> 11:32.899
Janice couldn't do it. Zora
couldn't do it. I stopped him.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.899
They weren't your powers, Christian.

11:35.900 --> 11:40.193
Wolfe burned through all your powers
like all the powers he absorbs.

11:40.318 --> 11:41.443
No...

11:41.610 --> 11:44.485
What you felt was his power.

11:44.610 --> 11:46.899
That's what you're angry for,
even if you don't know it.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.900
You're trying to steal Wolfe's powers.

11:50.900 --> 11:53.900
And I'm the one who wants to be like him?

12:10.260 --> 12:11.940
- Got you.
- What are you doing?

12:12.900 --> 12:15.899
- What are you doing?
- Me? What are you doing?

12:15.900 --> 12:18.899
- Let go of me!
- Do not even think about it.

12:18.900 --> 12:19.899
- I'm a Power!
- Hey!

12:19.900 --> 12:21.899
Leave me the fuck alone, or I'll kill you!

12:21.900 --> 12:23.899
Well, I am Powers Division,

12:23.900 --> 12:26.899
and you just threatened a police
officer with the use of powers.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.819
Welcome to the big time.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.900
He got us when we were young, Christian.

12:33.984 --> 12:35.899
When we wanted so much.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.899
We needed answers.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.899
And he had them.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.900
No, it was all lies, Johnny.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.899
Him. The Kidz. Us.

12:44.900 --> 12:48.899
We were all just grabbing
for whatever we could get.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.068
You know better than that.

12:51.193 --> 12:53.900
It went wrong, but we were a family.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.899
And you were my best friend.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.900
My brother.

13:00.900 --> 13:04.110
Yeah, well, if I was a
brother, I was a shitty brother.

13:05.900 --> 13:06.900
No.

13:07.900 --> 13:09.899
You helped me.

13:09.900 --> 13:13.860
Even after everything
changed, I could count on you.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.899
The benefit concert is the perfect venue.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.899
So, these are the candidates.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.735
Pick a winner and set it up.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.899
We want a classic hero-villain battle.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.899
Will Janice go for this?

13:27.900 --> 13:29.899
She will if she has any
sense. I mean, come on.

13:29.900 --> 13:32.899
Something like this will turn the
Retro Girl Mentorship Foundation

13:32.900 --> 13:34.899
into a phenomenon before it even launches.

13:34.900 --> 13:35.900
So, she's in?

13:35.984 --> 13:38.899
Oh, hell, no. She hates this shit.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.899
Look, just leave Janice to me.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.900
Candace, this is it.

13:42.984 --> 13:45.899
After this, Zora is at the top,

13:45.900 --> 13:47.860
and you're right there with her.

13:47.900 --> 13:48.900
Done and done.

13:50.026 --> 13:52.899
All right. I'll get it set up,
and I'll make sure Zora's prepped.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.899
Yeah. I'm not so sure about that.

13:55.900 --> 13:56.900
I mean...

13:58.485 --> 14:00.899
Zora's... She's already
really high-strung.

14:00.900 --> 14:02.900
She is. She's a little stiff.

14:04.068 --> 14:06.899
You're saying don't tell Zora?

14:06.900 --> 14:09.110
We need strong video to cement her rep.

14:09.235 --> 14:12.276
If this ends up looking
like community theater,

14:12.402 --> 14:15.899
she will never be an A-list
star. No, it's gotta be real.

14:15.900 --> 14:18.402
Craig, she has a right to know.

14:18.568 --> 14:21.860
And we're supposed to be looking
out for her best interests.

14:21.900 --> 14:22.900
We are.

14:24.026 --> 14:25.900
Come on.

14:27.193 --> 14:31.899
You fucked up your whole
life trying to save Wolfe.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.485
Hundreds of people are dead,

14:33.610 --> 14:34.900
and now you want to kill him?

14:37.235 --> 14:38.899
He told me...

14:38.900 --> 14:41.777
I don't want to hear his
lies come out of your mouth.

14:41.900 --> 14:42.899
If you want to kill him,

14:42.900 --> 14:46.819
fucking teleport into his
cell with a fucking gun,

14:46.900 --> 14:48.220
and shoot him in the fucking head.

14:49.276 --> 14:51.900
I can't teleport out of the Drainer.

14:53.900 --> 14:57.899
I don't want to sacrifice my
freedom if I don't have to.

14:57.900 --> 14:58.899
You don't have to.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.900
They're going to drain
him permanently anyway.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.899
And what if it doesn't work?

15:06.900 --> 15:10.900
What if the Drainer fails?
You know that can happen.

15:11.900 --> 15:12.899
Then he's still locked up.

15:12.900 --> 15:16.900
And you get a chance to steal his powers.

15:17.900 --> 15:18.900
Right, Christian?

15:22.693 --> 15:25.860
You know what? I'm... Get me out of here.

15:25.900 --> 15:28.901
Suffocate me, do whatever you want
to do, because I'm done listening.

15:29.026 --> 15:31.900
- Nothing I can say?
- There's nothing you can say.

15:32.900 --> 15:33.900
All right, then.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.899
Jesus Christ, Johnny.

15:38.900 --> 15:39.900
No!

15:45.900 --> 15:46.900
Shit.

15:50.900 --> 15:54.527
Fuck, man. It's not fucking
funny. It's not funny.

15:54.693 --> 15:56.900
It's pretty fucking funny.

16:03.151 --> 16:04.151
Fuck.

16:05.900 --> 16:07.860
Oh, I'm too old for this shit.

16:13.900 --> 16:17.899
I made Sway out of Wolfe, Christian.

16:17.900 --> 16:19.899
And now he's connected to
everyone who's ever taken it.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.900
And he can suck their
powers out from anywhere.

16:22.984 --> 16:25.899
Jesus, Johnny. Fuck!

16:25.900 --> 16:30.900
The Drainer fails, he can
absorb hundreds of powers.

16:30.984 --> 16:34.900
He will be unstoppable,
and they will all die.

16:36.900 --> 16:39.900
Including you and Calista.

16:45.900 --> 16:48.900
I'm going to kill him with or without you.

16:50.900 --> 16:52.899
If you want powers,

16:52.900 --> 16:55.900
your only chance is to go in there with me.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.819
You've got 12 hours to decide if you're in.

17:01.900 --> 17:05.276
If not, then I'm going to do as you say.

17:05.443 --> 17:07.898
I'm going to teleport in there with a gun

17:07.900 --> 17:09.900
and shoot him in the fucking head.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.900
You can count on it.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.200
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:43.900 --> 17:47.900
So, tell me, how does this work?

17:50.900 --> 17:52.899
Well,

17:52.900 --> 17:54.899
it suppresses the release

17:54.900 --> 17:57.777
of excitatory and
inhibitory neurotransmitters,

17:57.900 --> 18:00.899
while also increasing dopamine
in the ventral striatum.

18:00.900 --> 18:04.900
In other words, if it doesn't feel
good, you're not doing it right.

18:06.900 --> 18:09.899
Okay, now tell me how all of this works.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.151
Not so different, actually.

18:11.276 --> 18:14.899
It disrupts receptors, throws
up roadblocks in the brain,

18:14.900 --> 18:17.735
confuses the body on a molecular level.

18:17.860 --> 18:18.900
It can't really be that simple.

18:18.901 --> 18:22.899
The most effective science is
usually the most streamlined.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.943
How does this affect moving forward?

18:26.068 --> 18:27.899
If this technology is
going to make a difference,

18:27.900 --> 18:29.899
it has to be able to go everywhere.

18:29.900 --> 18:33.899
So, the new Drainer pod that's portable,

18:33.900 --> 18:37.900
and a single-use Drainer
pulse weapon, for now.

18:39.527 --> 18:40.900
What are you afraid of, Harley?

18:42.900 --> 18:44.151
Black Swan.

18:46.900 --> 18:51.899
It's a predictive model of the
destruction caused by Powers.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.899
All the Powers in the world.

18:53.900 --> 18:58.900
The inevitable chaos that comes
with unsustainable complexity.

19:00.900 --> 19:04.899
The whole world is governed
by unsustainable complexity.

19:04.900 --> 19:07.899
The most we can hope for
is to be safe in the moment.

19:07.900 --> 19:09.899
Until the next hurricane or earthquake

19:09.900 --> 19:11.899
or the next Wolfe comes along

19:11.900 --> 19:15.899
and reminds us that we're not
and we never have been in control.

19:15.900 --> 19:18.693
I need to know this is going to work.

19:18.819 --> 19:20.059
You're thinking about quitting.

19:20.900 --> 19:21.901
I'm tired, Harley.

19:22.900 --> 19:23.900
It's time.

19:25.900 --> 19:28.860
That would be a bad idea.

19:34.943 --> 19:36.900
Calista.

19:55.901 --> 19:58.860
No, that's not going to work.

19:58.900 --> 20:02.899
Whoever it is, he has to look
like a credible threat to Zora.

20:02.900 --> 20:05.899
Be able to take some serious blows.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.900
And he needs to be able to be booked today.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.693
Hey.

20:53.819 --> 20:55.899
Hey, what are you doing?

20:55.900 --> 20:57.899
Getting ready for work.

20:57.900 --> 21:00.899
Boss called me. Another Power went down.

21:00.900 --> 21:03.443
What is going on out there?
Is it somebody I know?

21:03.568 --> 21:06.899
Jump Striker? She's... was kind of new.

21:06.900 --> 21:09.899
Used to hang around at the Division.

21:09.900 --> 21:12.610
Wow. Hell of a way to start the day, huh?

21:12.777 --> 21:14.899
Well, it's the job, you know, so...

21:14.900 --> 21:15.943
What about you?

21:16.900 --> 21:17.899
Oh.

21:17.900 --> 21:19.777
Just getting ready for the big show.

21:19.900 --> 21:22.235
- The benefit? That's tonight?
- Yeah.

21:22.900 --> 21:23.900
Hey...

21:27.900 --> 21:29.900
Do you ever wish you were somebody else?

21:30.900 --> 21:32.899
You mean like Zora?

21:32.900 --> 21:34.900
I'd rather die than be that young again.

21:36.900 --> 21:37.900
No, just...

21:39.900 --> 21:42.899
Someone who could get up right now,

21:42.900 --> 21:45.899
walk out that door and not come back.

21:45.900 --> 21:51.485
Well, if you did that, at
least you'd be free tonight.

21:51.652 --> 21:54.527
Is that an invitation?

21:54.652 --> 21:55.900
Yeah.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.819
Yeah, if you want it to be, yes.

21:59.900 --> 22:02.900
Yes, I do. I'd like that.

22:03.900 --> 22:05.899
Just not tonight.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.693
Because you're still you?

22:07.860 --> 22:09.318
Well, somebody's got to be.

22:10.318 --> 22:11.900
For now.

22:12.900 --> 22:13.900
For now?

22:14.900 --> 22:15.899
What if I did, Christian?

22:15.900 --> 22:17.899
What if I walked up onto that stage tonight

22:17.900 --> 22:21.900
and said, "You want a hero?
Here's your hero. Zora."

22:22.900 --> 22:24.899
I'd be shocked.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.899
You couldn't. You wouldn't.

22:26.900 --> 22:29.527
We can't keep wanting the
same things, Christian.

22:31.900 --> 22:33.899
And it's okay to want change.

22:33.900 --> 22:34.899
Right?

22:34.900 --> 22:36.899
Yeah, sure.

22:36.900 --> 22:40.900
Sure, we can't always stay the same.

22:43.900 --> 22:44.900
Friday?

22:45.443 --> 22:46.860
What?

22:46.900 --> 22:50.899
- Friday night. Dinner, your place.
- Great. Yeah.

22:50.900 --> 22:51.899
Um...

22:51.900 --> 22:52.900
Yeah, I'll see you then!

22:53.900 --> 22:55.900
Okay.

23:05.900 --> 23:06.984
Jesus!

23:07.110 --> 23:09.899
I didn't know if you didn't hear
me or if you were just ignoring me.

23:09.900 --> 23:10.900
I was on the phone.

23:13.568 --> 23:16.899
Okay. I might be late tonight.

23:16.900 --> 23:19.899
Really late, if this thing that
I have been trying to make happen

23:19.900 --> 23:24.318
actually, um, you know, happens.

23:26.900 --> 23:27.900
Okay.

23:30.900 --> 23:33.110
Whatever you think about my job,

23:33.235 --> 23:37.652
it is the only thing that is keeping
a roof over our heads right now.

23:37.819 --> 23:40.900
And when Zora does well, hun, we do well.

23:42.693 --> 23:44.402
I am doing this for us.

23:45.900 --> 23:46.900
Don't.

23:47.900 --> 23:48.899
Okay, you know what?

23:48.900 --> 23:50.899
There's some chicken tikka
leftover in the fridge.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.318
I'll see you tonight.

23:54.901 --> 23:59.899
Olympia, Bug, Johnny Mace, Levitation Boy,

23:59.900 --> 24:02.193
five other Powerz Kidz, and Jump Striker.

24:04.068 --> 24:06.527
Wolfe killed Mace in the Shaft, though.

24:06.652 --> 24:09.900
When was the last time 10
Powers dropped in a couple weeks?

24:11.900 --> 24:15.899
- What do you think, Walker?
- About what?

24:15.900 --> 24:20.443
He thinks Royalle is killing off
Powers, trying to take over the city.

24:20.568 --> 24:22.568
That's cartoon bullshit, Adlard.

24:24.900 --> 24:25.901
What are we waiting on?

24:27.735 --> 24:28.900
Probable cause.

24:32.900 --> 24:33.900
Nobody moved her?

24:34.900 --> 24:36.900
Waiting on Dr. Death to give the okay.

24:38.777 --> 24:41.360
The tags are obviously fresh.

24:41.527 --> 24:44.899
You want I should put out an APB on Banksy?

24:44.900 --> 24:48.900
No, I want you should remember what
those punks tagged on our station.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.819
We will pay your bail

24:51.900 --> 24:54.060
and our lawyers can make the
charges go away in the end.

24:54.900 --> 24:55.901
Thank you.

24:56.900 --> 24:58.735
But I'll be honest,

24:58.901 --> 25:01.899
you'll probably do some time.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.899
No, I'm not going back to the Shaft
for some bogus publicity stunt.

25:04.900 --> 25:08.900
Think of it as the first phase
in the Red Hawk brand re-launch.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.899
Now, how much money we talking?

25:11.900 --> 25:14.652
Enough to tie up your
financial loose ends for now.

25:19.693 --> 25:21.900
You'd stage a rescue for me when I get out?

25:22.900 --> 25:23.899
Maybe save some kids or something?

25:23.900 --> 25:27.899
People love a redemption story, Danny.

25:27.900 --> 25:29.026
After a lifetime of being the villain,

25:29.151 --> 25:31.899
you'd finally get to be the hero.

25:31.900 --> 25:33.735
Can I think about this?

25:34.900 --> 25:35.899
Maybe you're not up to it.

25:35.900 --> 25:36.899
No, it's not that.

25:36.900 --> 25:40.899
Danny, I need somebody who
can step up and really deliver.

25:40.900 --> 25:42.899
This girl is good.

25:42.900 --> 25:45.360
So you have to be ready to bring it.

25:45.485 --> 25:47.900
So look me in the eye and
tell me that you can do that.

25:48.900 --> 25:49.900
I can do it.

25:50.819 --> 25:51.900
Good.

26:22.900 --> 26:23.899
Hey!

26:23.900 --> 26:24.900
You little shits.

26:29.568 --> 26:32.899
Stay tuned. There's more
where that came from.

26:32.900 --> 26:34.020
How do you spell "bludgeon"?

26:35.900 --> 26:37.899
- What?
- "Bludgeon."

26:37.900 --> 26:40.900
I don't know. It's got
a "D" in there somewhere.

26:42.900 --> 26:44.900
Zabriski, how do you make it rewind?

26:52.900 --> 26:54.900
It's supposed to be a
facial recognition mask.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.527
Keeps the camera from making an ID,

26:57.652 --> 26:59.900
looks like a real face from a distance.

27:00.900 --> 27:02.527
Just kids fucking around.

27:04.151 --> 27:06.899
Can this shit be fixed so I can see him?

27:06.900 --> 27:09.900
Cancilarra would know. He's good with tech.

27:14.735 --> 27:16.899
All right, what do you
guys want to see next?

27:16.900 --> 27:17.899
A pony?

27:17.900 --> 27:19.900
Yeah!

27:19.943 --> 27:21.485
Here we go.

27:22.610 --> 27:23.900
She's a superstar.

27:24.900 --> 27:26.235
She's just a kid herself.

27:26.900 --> 27:28.899
Speaking of which...

27:28.900 --> 27:30.899
Everything is set.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.899
- Wow.
- Good.

27:32.900 --> 27:35.984
- So, what does she know?
- Yeah, you like that?

27:36.151 --> 27:37.819
- Nothing.
- I'll sign these for you guys.

27:37.900 --> 27:38.900
All right.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.151
Is that a nose?

28:11.151 --> 28:12.900
It's going to be a nose, okay?

28:14.443 --> 28:17.900
Data recovery is more my
thing, imagery is hard.

28:18.735 --> 28:19.899
You look like shit.

28:19.900 --> 28:20.900
- Good morning.
- Mmm.

28:21.900 --> 28:22.899
Where have you been?

28:22.900 --> 28:25.899
I need every deleted item off this phone.

28:25.900 --> 28:27.020
How long is that gonna take?

28:27.068 --> 28:30.899
Yeah, sure, let me just
wave my magic wand over here.

28:30.900 --> 28:33.943
As long as we're talking about
one's whereabouts all damn day...

28:34.110 --> 28:36.899
I was in an alley with Jump Striker,

28:36.900 --> 28:39.527
or what's left of her colorful remains.

28:39.693 --> 28:40.899
- Shit.
- Yeah.

28:40.900 --> 28:43.899
We got 10 bodies, all connected to Sway.

28:43.900 --> 28:45.899
I know. Adlard's starting a pool.

28:45.900 --> 28:47.899
20-buck buy in? $50.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.899
And they're all connected to Royalle.

28:49.900 --> 28:51.899
Sure, circumstantially.

28:51.900 --> 28:53.735
That's a big word.

28:53.860 --> 28:54.901
Did you learn that in your
personal morning today?

28:55.026 --> 28:57.899
I'm just saying there's...
We don't have evidence.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.899
Since when do you need evidence

28:59.900 --> 29:01.943
to lay at the feet of Johnny
Royalle's every felonious act?

29:02.068 --> 29:05.899
We need evidence that
the court will accept.

29:05.900 --> 29:09.899
Not to mention require,
beyond my personal opinion.

29:09.900 --> 29:13.899
Well, then, today you might want
to buy into more than Adlard's pool,

29:13.900 --> 29:15.900
it being one of your luckier ones.

29:16.984 --> 29:18.899
What? Who's the one witness

29:18.900 --> 29:20.900
we have never been able to question?

29:22.900 --> 29:25.900
The one whose every road leads
to Johnny fucking Royalle.

29:30.900 --> 29:34.777
It's not often we get to
meet our heroes in real life,

29:34.900 --> 29:38.899
but these young women you see
here, they are all with us tonight

29:38.900 --> 29:42.777
to share their story and to
meet the woman who inspired them.

29:42.900 --> 29:44.899
And whose foundation
has reached out to them,

29:44.900 --> 29:47.899
to show them that we can all be heroes.

29:47.900 --> 29:50.899
So please, put your hands together

29:50.900 --> 29:54.899
and help me welcome the founder
of the Retro Girl Foundation,

29:54.900 --> 29:57.900
the one and only Retro Girl.

30:06.900 --> 30:09.485
Thank you all so much for coming.

30:09.900 --> 30:12.899
We live in a world of heroes.

30:12.900 --> 30:14.899
And those girls you just saw,

30:14.900 --> 30:16.899
they will be the heroes of tomorrow,

30:16.900 --> 30:18.899
whether they have powers or not,

30:18.900 --> 30:22.900
and that is the mission of
the Retro Girl Foundation.

30:32.900 --> 30:34.318
I'm not going to say anything,

30:34.443 --> 30:35.963
so you might as well take me to a cell.

30:36.900 --> 30:39.899
You are so fucked, Calista.

30:39.900 --> 30:43.899
I recently learned something
really, really interesting about you.

30:43.900 --> 30:46.900
You are 18 years of age.

30:47.943 --> 30:51.899
Yeah, welcome to the wonderful world

30:51.900 --> 30:53.899
of the adult criminal justice system.

30:53.900 --> 30:56.899
We are no longer two cops looking
out for your best interests.

30:56.900 --> 30:59.860
We're two cops looking to fucking bust you.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.610
Royalle's not coming.

31:10.735 --> 31:14.777
I promise you, you are the furthest
thing from his mind right now.

31:14.900 --> 31:16.899
Just talk to us.

31:16.900 --> 31:19.652
I didn't do anything wrong.

31:19.777 --> 31:22.900
Just supposing the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree...

31:23.900 --> 31:26.899
Uh, Todd Davis Secor.

31:26.900 --> 31:29.899
Assault, assault, assault with
intent to cause bodily harm,

31:29.900 --> 31:32.899
assault, assault, assault
with intent to kill.

31:32.900 --> 31:35.900
And the winner, voluntary manslaughter.

31:37.026 --> 31:39.900
You can't hold me for shit my dad did.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.899
Listen.

31:43.900 --> 31:47.899
- We can help you.
- We can keep you safe.

31:47.900 --> 31:50.900
Could I, uh, have a word with you?

31:54.527 --> 31:55.900
One sec.

31:58.900 --> 32:02.899
Tonight, you're going to meet
some of those incredible girls.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.568
Hey.

32:04.693 --> 32:06.899
Excuse me, ladies, could you
just give us a moment, please?

32:06.900 --> 32:08.899
- Thank you.
- ... An amazing young woman

32:08.900 --> 32:11.900
that I'm very proud to say is
our foundation's first mentor.

32:12.443 --> 32:13.610
Zora.

32:18.900 --> 32:21.899
I think there's something
that you need to know.

32:21.900 --> 32:23.652
She's going to introduce
you after the third song.

32:23.777 --> 32:24.899
Once you're up on stage...

32:24.900 --> 32:27.899
I know, I know. You already
told me. You told me.

32:27.900 --> 32:30.402
Bright acts of valor might
garner all the attention,

32:30.527 --> 32:33.899
but it's the unseen daily acts
of courage that change the world.

32:33.900 --> 32:36.693
Okay, I'm going to wait backstage.

32:36.819 --> 32:37.899
Okay.

32:37.900 --> 32:39.151
- I'll see you out there.
- Okay.

32:39.276 --> 32:40.899
That you will both reach
your greatest potential.

32:40.900 --> 32:43.900
You're also gonna hear
some pretty kickass music.

32:49.900 --> 32:50.899
- Okay.
- What?

32:50.900 --> 32:53.068
Just tell me that was a tactic.

32:53.193 --> 32:55.068
- What?
- To soften her up.

32:55.193 --> 32:56.899
Get her to believe you're on her side.

32:56.900 --> 32:58.899
Because you're not. All right?

32:58.900 --> 33:00.899
- You're not actually on her side.
- Of course not. No.

33:00.900 --> 33:02.900
So what was that white-knight
daddy shit in there?

33:04.900 --> 33:08.693
What? It's not daddy shit... I just...

33:08.819 --> 33:10.899
You know, she's not her father, okay?

33:10.900 --> 33:13.899
- Mmm-hmm.
- And I just thought maybe she could use some...

33:13.900 --> 33:15.901
- Can I interrupt?
- Please, I'm begging you.

33:16.026 --> 33:17.899
Oh, nice.

33:17.900 --> 33:20.900
Hello, Calista. I am so happy right now.

33:20.901 --> 33:22.899
Fuck me.

33:22.900 --> 33:24.899
Walker, you're not happy?
I could dance a jig.

33:24.900 --> 33:25.943
Oh, God.

33:26.068 --> 33:27.777
What?

33:27.900 --> 33:31.360
The kid with her, he's...

33:31.485 --> 33:34.899
Krispin. It's my old partner's kid.

33:34.900 --> 33:36.527
Oh, man.

33:36.652 --> 33:39.899
We ran the GPS on his phone.
He's at the Temple Theater.

33:39.900 --> 33:40.899
We should go.

33:40.900 --> 33:42.899
Yeah. What do we do with her?

33:42.900 --> 33:44.276
I've got an idea.

33:49.901 --> 33:54.900
So, put your hands together and give
a very, very loud welcome to Alchemy!

34:00.900 --> 34:02.900
How are you guys feeling out there?

34:11.900 --> 34:14.899
- No answer from Krispin's mom.
- What do we think?

34:14.900 --> 34:16.900
Retro Girl's benefit is at the Temple.

34:17.900 --> 34:19.899
Lots of press, lots of Powers.

You want your foundation
to be successful, right?

35:31.900 --> 35:33.443
This will help.

35:33.610 --> 35:35.899
He's not here for you, he's here for Zora.

35:35.900 --> 35:37.899
Are you kidding me?

35:37.900 --> 35:39.899
You are unbelievable.

35:39.900 --> 35:43.899
I will stand aside, and I
will let her have her moment,

35:43.900 --> 35:45.899
but you are fired.

35:45.900 --> 35:47.110
Oh, come on.

35:47.235 --> 35:48.899
You still need me.

35:48.900 --> 35:50.899
Not if I don't play the game.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.900
What, are you just gonna walk away?

35:53.900 --> 35:54.900

in the world of Powers,

36:13.900 --> 36:15.899
there's no limit to their hypocrisy.

36:15.900 --> 36:18.652
- What the hell's going on?
- This isn't a fundraiser, it's a scam.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.899
- Powers don't care about you or me.
- Where's Retro Girl?

36:20.900 --> 36:22.899
- They only care about their image.
- What the fuck is this?

36:22.900 --> 36:23.899
And how to sell it!

36:23.900 --> 36:26.899
There's no real heroes.

36:26.900 --> 36:28.899
Okay? There's no villains.

36:28.900 --> 36:31.819
There's only the fucking show!

36:31.900 --> 36:34.899
This, this is the Powers' world.

36:34.900 --> 36:38.900
Packaged, rehearsed, and 100% fake.

36:39.900 --> 36:43.900
I am Red Hawk.

36:44.900 --> 36:45.900
Zora!

36:51.900 --> 36:52.900
Krisp!

36:54.900 --> 36:55.943
Zora!

36:57.527 --> 36:58.900
I'm here for you.

36:59.900 --> 37:01.900
You can't hide.

37:31.900 --> 37:33.899
Gotta give 'em what they want.

37:33.900 --> 37:35.527
Huh?

38:02.900 --> 38:03.900
What the fuck?

38:11.900 --> 38:13.899
- Mom?
- No, no!

38:13.900 --> 38:15.900
That wasn't supposed to happen.

38:21.193 --> 38:22.900
Can somebody help?

38:23.900 --> 38:26.900
I didn't... I didn't mean to.

38:28.193 --> 38:29.360
Why didn't you stop me?

38:49.900 --> 38:50.899
This is Walker.

38:50.900 --> 38:53.900
We're at the Temple
Theater. We need backup now.

39:00.900 --> 39:02.899
Enough.

39:02.900 --> 39:03.899
But he... he...

39:03.900 --> 39:05.899
Show's over, Zora. Come on.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.900
Come on, move out of the way. Come on, man.

40:35.318 --> 40:36.900
Like old times.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.900
Like old times.

40:40.998 --> 40:42.242
You can count on it.
