WEBVTT

00:00.431 --> 00:01.502
(creak)

00:01.502 --> 00:03.003
(gasps)

00:09.540 --> 00:12.043
(loud creak)

00:12.043 --> 00:13.514
(panting)

00:13.514 --> 00:15.346
(utensils clatter)

00:15.346 --> 00:17.688
OKAY. OKAY, BAD GUY!

00:17.688 --> 00:20.051
I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE,

00:20.051 --> 00:22.323
BUT YOU PICKED
THE WRONG HOUSE, BUDDY.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.495
THE WRONG HOUSE!

00:24.495 --> 00:25.796
I MAY BE SCARED,

00:25.796 --> 00:29.100
BUT I AM NOT GOING DOWN
LIKE THIS!

00:29.100 --> 00:31.762
NOW THAT TRAV'S AT COLLEGE,
WHAT'S IT LIKE

00:31.762 --> 00:34.135
LIVING ALL ALONE
IN THIS BIG, EMPTY HOUSE?

00:34.135 --> 00:36.667
I WOULDN'T SAY
I'M GETTING A LOT OF SLEEP.

00:36.667 --> 00:40.641
WHY A SPOON? YOU CAN'T HURT
ANYBODY WITH A SPOON.
(Laurie laughs)

00:40.641 --> 00:43.144
OW!
OH, PLEASE. I BARELY HIT YOU.

00:43.144 --> 00:47.278
(high-pitched voice) OHH.
(sighs) I CAN'T BELIEVE
TRAVIS IS GONE. I JUST--

00:47.278 --> 00:50.281
I MISS HIM SO MUCH. EXCEPT FOR
WHEN I LIVED IN PARIS,

00:50.281 --> 00:53.684
I'VE NEVER LIVED ALONE BEFORE.
YOU'VE ALSO NEVER LIVED
IN PARIS.

00:53.684 --> 00:55.686
IF YOU VISIT A PLACE
FOR OVER A WEEK,

00:55.686 --> 00:58.689
THEN YOU GET TO SAY
YOU LIVED THERE.
WELL, THEN I'M A BADASS,

00:58.689 --> 01:02.093
BECAUSE I LIVED
IN A WOMEN'S PRISON ONCE.
CRACKER ALERT.

01:02.093 --> 01:04.395
(door opens, bells jingle)
OH. I PUT BELLS
ON THE FRONT DOOR.

01:04.395 --> 01:06.667
THAT WAY I KNOW WHEN SOMEONE'S
COMING IN TO KILL ME.
(door closes)

01:06.667 --> 01:08.139
(both) OH.

01:08.139 --> 01:10.070
I LIKE THE BELLS.
IT'S A LITTLE CHRISTMASSY.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.444
OHH. WITH TRAVIS GONE,
HOW AM I EVER GONNA FEEL SAFE?

01:13.444 --> 01:15.446
JULES, I'M HERE SLEEPING
WITH YOU MOST NIGHTS.

01:15.446 --> 01:17.108
(singsongy) HOLLER.

01:17.108 --> 01:19.410
(normal voice)
PLUS, IT'S A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.852
YOU'RE RIGHT. OH, BOY.

01:21.852 --> 01:24.215
WHAT, I-IS THERE A MARK?
NO.

01:24.215 --> 01:26.217
REALLY? BECAUSE IT FEELS
HOT AND RAISED.

01:26.217 --> 01:29.620
WELL, IT'S NOT. (chuckles)
I MEAN, COME ON. GUYS?
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.293
NO, I DON'T SEE--YEESH.
NOPE. I DON'T SEE NOTHIN'.

01:32.293 --> 01:35.296
WITHIN MY FINGER CIRCLE THAT
I'M MAKING--NOTHING RIGHT THERE?
(Jules) NOPE.

01:35.296 --> 01:38.199
(sighs)
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT, KEVIN?

01:38.199 --> 01:41.872
THIS... IS... COLLEGE.

01:41.872 --> 01:44.435
YOU KNOW, IN HIGH SCHOOL,
WASN'T THAT POPULAR.

01:44.435 --> 01:46.437
WASN'T A DORK.
HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

01:46.437 --> 01:48.609
HAD INTERCOURSE WITH HER.
YOU KNOW... HOW I... DO.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.612
BUT, UH, STILL MOST PEOPLE
JUST KNEW ME AS THE GUY

01:51.612 --> 01:54.615
WITH THE HAIRCUT WHO MADE
HIS HEAD LOOK PERFECTLY SQUARE.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.886
BUT NOT HERE. (chuckles)

01:55.886 --> 01:58.589
NO. HERE I'M GONNA BE
A QUIET BADASS,

01:58.589 --> 02:00.451
LIKE HARRY POTTER.

02:00.451 --> 02:03.454
NOT EARLY POTTER, BUT IN
THE LAST BOOK, WHEN HE--

02:03.454 --> 02:06.126
WHAT AM I DOING? (chuckles)
YOU PROBABLY READ IT.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.160
THE POINT IS, THAT'S
THE GREAT THING ABOUT COLLEGE.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.702
YOU DECIDE
WHO YOU'RE GOING TO BE.

02:11.702 --> 02:14.134
I'M GONNA CALL YOU
"SQUARE HEAD."

02:14.134 --> 02:15.706
FANTASTIC.
(claps hands)

02:15.706 --> 02:18.309
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH MYSELF, YOU KNOW?

02:18.309 --> 02:21.342
WHEN TRAVIS WAS HERE, I ALWAYS
HAD SOMETHING TO OBSESS OVER.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.774
HE WAS LIKE MY OWN LITTLE
PALE SCIENCE PROJECT.

02:23.774 --> 02:26.417
GO SEE HIM. DORK UNIVERSITY
IS ONLY, LIKE, 20 MINUTES AWAY.

02:26.417 --> 02:29.420
I PROMISED
I'D STOP BEING SO CLINGY.
(doorbell rings)

02:29.420 --> 02:32.923
WE'RE ONLY GONNA TALK
ONCE A WEEK.

02:32.923 --> 02:34.755
(door closes, bells jingle)

02:34.755 --> 02:36.827
WHAT, YOU'RE FINALLY NOTICING
MY NEW HAIRCUT?

02:36.827 --> 02:39.830
I THINK IT'S AWESOME, TOO.
THAT CONSTANT ATTENTION
JULES TORTURED TRAV WITH...

02:39.830 --> 02:41.832
(clicks tongue) WELL,
THAT CRAP BOMB'S GOTTA LAND

02:41.832 --> 02:45.196
ON SOMEONE ELSE, BUDDY.
GUESS WHO SHE'S GONNA PICK?

02:45.196 --> 02:48.168
SINCE YOUR SON LEFT,
I WANTED TO CHEER YOU UP.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.202
IT'S MY FAMILY'S LABEL.
UH, WE'RE ALL WINEMAKERS.

02:51.202 --> 02:52.703
THANKS, TOM.

02:52.703 --> 02:55.776
NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU JUST
GOT WAY MORE INTERESTING.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.509
I RECENTLY EARNED
MY ORANGE BELT IN JUJITSU.

02:58.509 --> 03:00.881
AND NOW YOU'RE RUNNING
BACK THE OTHER WAY.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.883
(bells jingle, door closes)
LOOK, I DON'T LIKE ATTENTION,

03:02.883 --> 03:05.856
SO IF JULES TRIES
TO SMOTHER ME WITH IT,

03:05.856 --> 03:07.388
I WILL JUST SAY NO.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.820
(all laughing)

03:09.820 --> 03:13.224
WHAT ARE WE LAUGHING AT?
OH, MY GOD. THOSE JEANS SUCK.

03:13.224 --> 03:16.667
IT'S LIKE YOU FORGOT TO PUT
YOUR ASS ON THIS MORNING.

03:16.667 --> 03:20.200
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR LOOK. (chuckles)

03:22.202 --> 03:23.974
FINALLY SEE YOUR HEAD?

03:23.974 --> 03:26.407
MM-HMM.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.908
MAN, THAT STINKS.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.941
I USED TO ROCK THE JEAN SHORTS
AND HALF-SHIRT,

03:30.941 --> 03:33.914
BUT THEN THE GIRLS WENT
AND STOLE MY WHOLE LOOK.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.516
REMEMBER HOW STUDLY
BURT REYNOLDS LOOKED

03:35.516 --> 03:37.217
IN THAT GETUP?
(chuckles)

03:37.217 --> 03:39.890
"HEY, LOOK AT ME.
I'M A HAIRY ADONIS." (laughs)
(cell phone rings)

03:39.890 --> 03:42.453
YEAH, THE HALF-AND-HALF
WAS REGAL.

03:42.453 --> 03:43.954
HEY, ROSA. YEAH, SURE.

03:43.954 --> 03:47.898
IF, UH, STAN IS HAVING FUN
IN THE PARK, STAY THERE.

03:47.898 --> 03:50.000
ALL RIGHT. MAN,
OUR NEW NANNY IS AWESOME.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.263
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE OLD ONE?

03:52.263 --> 03:54.265
WHEN STAN GOES TO SLEEP,

03:54.265 --> 03:56.907
JUST SHAKE A LITTLE CEREAL
IN HIS CRIB.

03:56.907 --> 03:58.909
THAT WAY, IN THE MORNING,

03:58.909 --> 04:00.971
HE WON'T WAKE US UP
WHEN HE'S HUNGRY.

04:00.971 --> 04:04.014
HE'LL JUST EAT THE ONES STUCK
TO HIS TINY ARMS.
(chomps)

04:04.014 --> 04:07.017
SHE MAY HAVE CALLED
CHILD SERVICES.

04:07.017 --> 04:08.649
OKAY, GUYS.

04:08.649 --> 04:11.852
AAH. THESE ARE TOO TIGHT.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.654
OH, NUT UP, CRYBABY.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.826
YOU THINK WOMEN ENJOY
WEARING TIGHT JEANS?

04:15.826 --> 04:18.489
DO YOU THINK I'M LYING LIKE THIS
TO LOOK SEXY?

04:18.489 --> 04:20.861
MONGO, FLIP ME.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.434
(grunts)

04:23.434 --> 04:25.596
IN ORDER TO GET
THESE JEANS FASTENED,

04:25.596 --> 04:28.599
I HAVE TO LIE FLAT
ON THE GROUND, AND EITHER SMITH

04:28.599 --> 04:30.841
OR, IF HE'S NOT THERE,
MY BUILDING MANAGER

04:30.841 --> 04:32.843
HAS TO YANK
THE SIDES TOGETHER

04:32.843 --> 04:34.805
WHILE I SUCK IN
AND DO A QUICK ZIP,

04:34.805 --> 04:37.908
AND THEN THE NEXT DAY,
I AM BRUISED FROM HERE...

04:37.908 --> 04:39.650
TO HERE.

04:39.650 --> 04:41.612
THESE ARE MY STANDING JEANS.

04:41.612 --> 04:44.585
I LITERALLY CANNOT SIT DOWN
IN THEM. WATCH.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.588
I'M GONNA RELAX MY WHOLE BODY
AND JUST CRUMBLE TO THE GROUND.
(crunch)

04:47.588 --> 04:48.889
OH, NO, I'M NOT.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.891
YOU SEE, BECAUSE MY JEANS
ARE HOLDING ME UP.
YEAH.

04:50.891 --> 04:53.794
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
I DECIDED?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.866
DOESN'T HE LOOK BETTER
IN GLASSES?

04:55.866 --> 04:57.998
HELLO, JEFF GOLDBLUM.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.931
(Grayson)
в™Є I'M IN HELL, I'M IN HELL в™Є

05:00.931 --> 05:03.534
в™Є SHE TELL ME GET MY COMB,
SHE DON'T LIKE MY HAIR в™Є

05:03.534 --> 05:06.036
в™Є SHE TELL ME MOVE MY BOOTS,
SHE DON'T WANT 'EM THERE в™Є

05:06.036 --> 05:08.038
в™Є SHE SAYS THAT AGAIN,
I TELL YA WHAT I'M GONNA SAY в™Є

05:08.038 --> 05:09.540
в™Є I'M GONNA SAY в™Є

05:09.540 --> 05:11.512
BACK UP OFF ME, BABY, OKAY?

05:11.512 --> 05:14.014
I'M A GROWN MAN.
I'LL MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.687
в™Є JUST NOT TO HER FACE,
I'M IN HE-- в™Є

05:16.687 --> 05:19.520
HEY. IS THAT A NEW SONG?

05:19.520 --> 05:21.852
YEAH. IT--I'M NOT REALLY
READY TO SHARE IT YET.

05:21.852 --> 05:24.695
WELL, WHEN YOU'RE READY.

05:24.695 --> 05:26.727
OH, YEAH.

05:26.727 --> 05:30.601
HEY, HOT FLASH.
DID YOU DO THIS?

05:30.601 --> 05:33.604
I DID. SEE, THE REASON
I BUY EXPENSIVE THINGS

05:33.604 --> 05:35.906
IS TO BELITTLE PEOPLE
WHO CAN'T AFFORD THEM.

05:35.906 --> 05:39.870
(chuckles) OOH, GIRL, YOU JUST
GOT SERVED. OR IS IT "OWNED"?

05:39.870 --> 05:41.872
"OWNED" IS
WHEN YOU DOMINATE SOMEONE

05:41.872 --> 05:44.875
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
"SERVED" IS A SWIFT TAKEDOWN,

05:44.875 --> 05:46.517
OFTEN MARKED
BY A DANCE CELEBRATION.

05:46.517 --> 05:49.049
OH, AND, UH,
WHAT'S A SNOOKI?

05:49.049 --> 05:51.982
PAYBACK IS COMING, ELLIE.

05:51.982 --> 05:55.926
OOH, SCARY. HONEY,
YOU'RE SO OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE,

05:55.926 --> 05:58.429
IT'S LIKE PLAYING CHESS
WITH A MONKEY.

05:58.429 --> 06:01.592
(gasps)
STAN'S DOWN,
SO I'LL DO HIS LAUNDRY.

06:01.592 --> 06:04.795
THAT'S FINE, NANNY.
DON'T NEED THE PLAY-BY-PLAY.
YES, MA'AM.

06:04.795 --> 06:07.768
ARE YOU CALLING HER "NANNY"?
I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ROSA.

06:07.768 --> 06:11.402
SHE'S AMAZING. I JUST DON'T
WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH HER,

06:11.402 --> 06:13.474
SO I'M KEEPING IT PROFESSIONAL.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.776
I HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE
WHO THINK THEY'RE MY FRIENDS

06:15.776 --> 06:18.679
WANDERING AROUND MY HOUSE
STEALING TIME FROM ME.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.581
YOU MEAN HER,
NOT ME, RIGHT?

06:20.581 --> 06:22.953
OHH.

06:22.953 --> 06:24.955
(Bobby) DURING MY GLORIOUS
NINE WEEKS IN COLLEGE,

06:24.955 --> 06:27.658
I ROCKED THE HALF-AND-HALF,
AND MAYBE YOU CAN HELP

06:27.658 --> 06:29.790
BRING THAT LOOK BACK
ON YOUR CAMPUS.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.993
WHAT DO YOU SAY, TRAV? YOU WANT
TO BE THE TIP OF THAT SPEAR?
PASS.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.767
AND THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE WEARING.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

06:36.767 --> 06:38.799
SO, DAD,
YOU KNOW HOW EXCITED I AM

06:38.799 --> 06:40.631
TO REDEFINE MYSELF
AT COLLEGE?

06:40.631 --> 06:42.773
QUIET BADASS,
LIKE HARRY POTTER.

06:42.773 --> 06:44.905
I'M JUST NOT QUITE SURE
HOW TO DO IT.

06:44.905 --> 06:48.008
SOUNDS LIKE THIS TALK
NEEDS TO BE FACE-TO-FACE.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.080
DON'T COME HERE. DON'T COME
HERE. DON'T COME HERE! DON'T--

06:52.983 --> 06:55.415
HEY, BUDDY.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.488
(humming)

06:57.488 --> 07:00.891
HEY, DID I TELL YOU I PLAYED
THE DRUMS WHEN I WAS A KID?

07:00.891 --> 07:03.894
(continues humming)
NO, YOU DON'T NEED
TO HEAR IT FROM ME.

07:03.894 --> 07:05.956
LET MY HANDS DO THE TALKIN'.

07:05.956 --> 07:09.159
WE SHOULD JAM TOGETHER.

07:09.159 --> 07:11.862
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, I HAVE
ALWAYS WANTED A JAM ROOM.

07:11.862 --> 07:13.864
WE SHOULD EVERYONE OVER
AND JUST JAM OUT.

07:13.864 --> 07:16.507
I MEAN, TALKIN'--JUST JAM.
I CAN'T STOP SAYING "JAM."

07:16.507 --> 07:19.009
MY MUSIC IS KIND OF...
PERSONAL.

07:19.009 --> 07:21.141
I MEAN, YOU UNDERSTAND
PERSONAL SPACE...

07:21.141 --> 07:23.674
THINK. (chuckles)
THANKS FOR LISTENING.

07:23.674 --> 07:25.676
(door opens, bells jingle)
OH. I LOVE
MY SECURITY SYSTEM.

07:25.676 --> 07:28.018
(door closes)
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE I LIVE
IN AN ANTIQUE STORE.

07:28.018 --> 07:30.020
(chuckles) MAY I HELP YOU?

07:30.020 --> 07:32.953
ABOUT THAT, UM, WELL,
I'M FEELING KIND OF GUILTY,

07:32.953 --> 07:35.726
BECAUSE THIS MORNING, YOU WERE
FREAKING OUT ABOUT SAFETY,

07:35.726 --> 07:38.158
AND I JUST KINDA BLEW PAST IT,
BUT, UM...

07:38.158 --> 07:40.160
OH, FORGET IT. I, UH...

07:40.160 --> 07:42.833
(chuckles)
I DON'T WANT TO SCARE YOU.
TELL ME.

07:42.833 --> 07:44.835
WELL, I WENT BY MY PLACE,

07:44.835 --> 07:46.937
AND... WELL,
SOME DVDs ARE MISSING.

07:46.937 --> 07:49.540
AND I'LL JUST SAY IT.
OKAY. SEVERAL.

07:49.540 --> 07:52.543
AND I KNOW IT'S NOT SOMEONE
GETTING DRAGGED INTO THE WOODS

07:52.543 --> 07:56.006
AND CHOPPED UP, BUT, UH,
STILL PRETTY SCARY, YOU KNOW?
GET EVERYBODY OVER HERE.

07:56.006 --> 07:59.950
WELCOME TO THE FIRST
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH MEETING.

07:59.950 --> 08:02.953
(whispers) YOU SON OF A BITCH.
YOU TOOK US ALL DOWN WITH YOU!

08:02.953 --> 08:04.985
SHH. SHE'S TALKING.

08:04.985 --> 08:08.058
THIS IS OUR CUL-DE-SAC, DAMN IT,
AND WE'VE GOTTA PROTECT IT.

08:08.058 --> 08:11.061
TONIGHT WE TAKE BACK THE SAC!

08:11.061 --> 08:15.065
FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS--
WE NEED A NEW SLOGAN.
(pen clicks)

08:15.065 --> 08:18.068
в™Єв™Єв™Є

08:26.006 --> 08:27.938
FOUND SOME BATTERIES
FOR MY FLASHLIGHT.

08:27.938 --> 08:30.240
I HAD TO TAKE IT OUT
OF MY, UM... SOMETHING.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.913
ANYWAY, BACK TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD
WATCH ASSOCIATION.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.115
THE MAIN GOAL
OF THE N.W.A. IS SAFETY.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.147
I THOUGHT IT WAS
TO REPRESENT COMPTON. WHAT?

08:37.147 --> 08:39.119
(deep voice)
MM! YEAH-Y, YEAH-Y!

08:39.119 --> 08:41.622
OKAY. I-I DON'T GET THAT.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.924
YESTERDAY,
GRAYSON'S DVDs WERE STOLEN.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.657
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'LL
BE SIGNING FOR SOME PACKAGE

08:46.657 --> 08:48.659
THAT CONTAINS--GUESS WHAT?
MY HEAD.

08:48.659 --> 08:50.661
IF WE'RE SNEAKING AROUND
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AT NIGHT,

08:50.661 --> 08:52.903
SHOULD MY HUSBAND BE DRESSED
AS A CAT BURGLAR?

08:52.903 --> 08:55.035
YOU LADIES NEED
A LITTLE MUSCLE OUT THERE.

08:55.035 --> 09:00.711
(strained voice)
CUBAN... MISSILE... CRISIS.

09:00.711 --> 09:02.312
HEY, NICE RIDE.

09:02.312 --> 09:05.576
WHAT ARE YOU TOPPIN' OUT AT?
12, MAYBE 13 M.P.H.?

09:05.576 --> 09:07.948
WHY'D HE GIVE ME
THE STINK EYE?

09:07.948 --> 09:10.681
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT
YOU ALSO DRIVE A GOLF CART.

09:10.681 --> 09:12.683
HE JUST THINKS
YOU'RE BEING A DOUCHE.

09:12.683 --> 09:15.285
YOU SEE, YOU'RE A THINKER,
TRAV. THIS IS COLLEGE.

09:15.285 --> 09:18.058
YOU GOTTA SHUT THAT BRAIN OFF.
YO!

09:18.058 --> 09:20.731
SQUARE HEAD,
WANNA PLAY ULTIMATE FRISBEE?

09:20.731 --> 09:22.993
YEAH, SQUARE HEAD
AND ME ARE IN!
ALL RIGHT.

09:22.993 --> 09:25.896
REALLY? YOU'RE JUST RUNNING
WITH THAT NICKNAME,

09:25.896 --> 09:29.870
NO QUESTIONS ASKED, HUH?
TIME TO JUMP IN. JUST DON'T MAKE
THAT GIRLIE NOISE YOU MAKE

09:29.870 --> 09:31.642
WHEN YOU THROW STUFF.

09:31.642 --> 09:33.844
WHAT NOISE? I MAKE A NOISE?

09:33.844 --> 09:35.145
MMM.

09:35.145 --> 09:37.848
THE GOOD THING ABOUT BURGERS
IS THAT YOU CAN--

09:37.848 --> 09:41.351
ANDY, I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE
ONE OF OUR QUIET DINNERS.

09:41.351 --> 09:44.214
SWEETIE, IT'S JUST,
I NEED SOME DOWNTIME

09:44.214 --> 09:48.058
BEFORE WE FAKE PROTECT
THE NEIGHBORHOOD. MMM.

09:48.058 --> 09:52.092
(sighs) SO, ELLIE,
WE HARDLY KNOW EACH OTHER!

09:52.092 --> 09:54.324
WHERE'D YOU GROW UP?
WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

09:54.324 --> 09:57.067
TALK TO ME, GIRLFRIEND.

09:57.067 --> 09:58.829
I WAS SO STUNNED.

09:58.829 --> 10:02.633
DO I GIVE OFF A VIBE THAT I WANT
TO BE FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE?

10:02.633 --> 10:05.035
(laughs) YEAH.
YEAH, THAT'S YOUR VIBE.

10:05.035 --> 10:06.807
(lowered voice) OKAY.
KILL THE SIDE CHATTER.

10:06.807 --> 10:10.110
TAKE A GLOW STICK. OKAY?
THESE ARE FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.982
(snaps)

10:11.982 --> 10:13.213
(normal voice) REALLY?

10:13.213 --> 10:15.045
(laughs)
BUT THEY'RE SO GLOWY.

10:15.045 --> 10:17.217
I BROKE MINE. (chuckles)

10:17.217 --> 10:19.990
LOOKS LIKE THE PREDATOR
BLED ALL OVER ME.

10:19.990 --> 10:22.352
(growls and laughs)
(cell phone alert chimes)

10:22.352 --> 10:25.996
OH, IT'S TRAV.
OH! IT'S NOT MY DAY TO TALK,
BUT I-I GOTTA GET A FIX.

10:25.996 --> 10:28.398
I'M GONNA WRITE BACK AS YOU.
(singsongy) "HEY, HOT DOG."

10:28.398 --> 10:30.400
(cell phone alert chimes)
HE KNOWS IT'S NOT YOU.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.663
WAIT.
BOBBY'S AT HIS COLLEGE?

10:32.663 --> 10:35.005
YOU DON'T SAY?

10:35.005 --> 10:36.967
(men shout indistinctly)

10:36.967 --> 10:39.009
ANDY, RIGHT HERE!
I'M OPEN!
WHOO-HOO!

10:39.009 --> 10:41.041
DAD, GO LONG!
(high-pitched voice) AAH!

10:41.041 --> 10:43.944
OHH!

10:43.944 --> 10:46.046
(normal voice) YEAH!
AGAIN!

10:46.046 --> 10:47.718
OH-HO-HO!
(Bobby) WELL DONE, SON!

10:47.718 --> 10:50.020
WAY TO GO, S.H.

10:50.020 --> 10:52.052
(deep voice) THANKS, KEV.
(high-pitched voice) AAH!

10:53.754 --> 10:56.286
I'M SICK
OF NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.
(Ellie) I'M BORED.

10:56.286 --> 10:59.189
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M BORED, TOO.
LET'S GO HOME.
YEAH.

10:59.189 --> 11:01.361
I-I WANT TO CUT OFF
SOME OF MY HAIR

11:01.361 --> 11:04.094
AND SEE WHAT YOU'D LOOK LIKE
WITH A GOATEE.
(laughs)

11:04.094 --> 11:06.066
YEAH.
N-NO. NO, NO, NO. NO GOATEE.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.800
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH. I KNOW
WHAT'LL MAKE THIS MORE FUN.

11:09.800 --> 11:13.103
THIS DOES MAKE IT MORE FUN.
(chuckles)

11:13.103 --> 11:14.945
YEAH.
GOD, I LIKE TOM WINE.

11:14.945 --> 11:16.947
YOU KNOW, I THINK
HIS FAMILY HAS A VINEYARD.

11:16.947 --> 11:18.949
(Laurie) HEY, YOU GUYS!

11:18.949 --> 11:21.451
TOM'S FAMILY DOESN'T HAVE
THE VINEYARD.

11:21.451 --> 11:23.854
HE IS THE VINEYARD!

11:23.854 --> 11:25.916
(squishing and pounding)

11:25.916 --> 11:29.219
(Laurie)
WE'RE DRINKING HIS FEET!

11:29.219 --> 11:31.792
UGH. LET'S POUR IT OUT.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.894
IT IS PRETTY GOOD, THOUGH.

11:33.894 --> 11:37.097
AND ALCOHOL IS STERILE.
TO SWEATY FOOT WINE.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.099
CIN-CIN!
I'M WITH YA.

11:39.099 --> 11:42.032
MMM.
I WONDER
WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON.

11:42.032 --> 11:43.734
CHECK THIS OUT.

11:43.734 --> 11:46.406
I THOUGHT RICK AND STEVE
WERE BROTHERS!

11:46.406 --> 11:48.408
CHAD SHULTZ JUST OPENED
A BEER

11:48.408 --> 11:50.981
DURING HIS INTERVENTION!

11:50.981 --> 11:52.813
(lowered voice)
WOW, THE GOLDSTEINS' FIGHT

11:52.813 --> 11:55.816
GOT SEXUAL IN A HURRY.
(lowered voice)
I KNOW. IT'S LIKE,

11:55.816 --> 11:59.089
"YOU'RE WORTHLESS. I HATE YOU.
PUT A BABY INSIDE OF ME!"

11:59.089 --> 12:00.851
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH SUCKED,

12:00.851 --> 12:03.924
BUT WINE AND SPY ROCKS!
(chuckles) WE'VE BEEN MADE.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.026
(normal voice)
SCATTER! SCATTER!

12:07.027 --> 12:08.328
(dogs barking)

12:08.328 --> 12:10.761
AAH!
AAH!

12:10.761 --> 12:13.163
(telephone rings)
(laughter)

12:13.163 --> 12:15.735
(ring, beep)

12:15.735 --> 12:17.107
(Jules) HELLO? OH, HI, CAROL.

12:17.107 --> 12:19.109
WHAT, YOU SAW
SOME TEENAGERS OUTSIDE?

12:19.109 --> 12:21.942
(lowered voice) SHE THOUGHT
WE WERE TEENAGERS!
(whispers) ALL RIGHT!

12:21.942 --> 12:24.945
(normal voice) OKAY, WHAT?
I'VE GOTTA GO TELL MY NANNY
I DON'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.947
UGH. NOT SMART.
WHAT?

12:26.947 --> 12:29.449
IT'S JUST,
YOU SAID YOU LOVE ROSA,

12:29.449 --> 12:31.481
AND SHE'S SO GREAT
WITH STAN.

12:31.481 --> 12:33.884
I SAW THEM PLAYING PEEKABOO
DURING WINE AND SPY.

12:33.884 --> 12:36.827
SHE'S SO PATIENT. YOU SNAP
BEFORE THE FIRST "BOO."

12:36.827 --> 12:38.829
IT'S A DUMB GAME.
(scoffs)

12:38.829 --> 12:41.892
"OH, WHERE DID I GO?"
"I'M BEHIND THE MAGAZINE AGAIN."

12:41.892 --> 12:43.894
SNORE.
WHATEVER.
IF YOU SHUT ROSA OUT,

12:43.894 --> 12:47.037
YOU THINK SHE'LL STILL BE
SO AMAZING WITH STAN?
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

12:47.037 --> 12:50.140
YOU LOVE YOUR BOY.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

12:50.140 --> 12:52.072
OH, CRAP.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.946
YOU UP FOR SOME TEA
AND SCRABBLE?

12:58.448 --> 13:01.051
YEAH.

13:01.051 --> 13:03.053
THE REASON WHY A HALF-SHIRT'S
SO EXCITING, KEV,

13:03.053 --> 13:05.956
IS BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A CURTAIN
COMING UP FOR THE SHOW.

13:05.956 --> 13:09.059
I'M GLAD MY DAD SHOWED UP.

13:09.059 --> 13:10.961
AND ME, TOO, RIGHT?

13:10.961 --> 13:13.463
MY DAD REALLY GOT ME
OUT THERE TODAY.

13:13.463 --> 13:17.367
PRETTY SOON, PEOPLE ARE
GONNA KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT.

13:17.367 --> 13:19.799
THEY ALREADY KNOW.
YOU'RE BOBBY COBB'S SON.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.102
HE DOES ALL THE DIRTY WORK
OF BEING AWESOME,

13:22.102 --> 13:25.075
AND WE JUST HANG ON
TO THE SWEET, MUSKY CHARISMA

13:25.075 --> 13:27.007
AND ENJOY THE RIDE.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.439
I'M NOT RIDING
MY DAD'S MUSK.

13:29.439 --> 13:31.511
YO, I'M NOT GONNA CALL YOU
SQUARE HEAD ANYMORE.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.443
OKAY.

13:33.443 --> 13:35.986
YOUR NEW NAME IS
"NOT BOBBY." (laughs)
(laughs)

13:35.986 --> 13:39.189
HEY, UH, NOT BOBBY,
HAS THE RED SPOT GONE AWAY YET?

13:39.189 --> 13:41.521
YEP.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.023
MMM.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.524
MMM. QUICK PAUSE.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.057
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THOSE EYEBROWS.

13:47.057 --> 13:49.559
YOU'RE STARTING TO LOOK
A LITTLE GREEK. (chuckles)

13:49.559 --> 13:51.561
SEE, I USED TO LIVE
IN ATHENS--

13:51.561 --> 13:53.103
COME ON. YOU'VE GOT

13:53.103 --> 13:56.036
YOUR KOOKY NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH
TO THINK ABOUT.

13:56.036 --> 13:59.039
NO NEED TO FOCUS ON ME.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "KOOKY"?

13:59.039 --> 14:01.141
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LIKE.

14:01.141 --> 14:04.444
NO. WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT I'M LIKE?

14:04.444 --> 14:07.978
WELL, YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE
EMPTY NEST THING GOING ON,

14:07.978 --> 14:10.981
SO YOU'VE BEEN DUMPING
ALL YOUR ATTENTION ON ME,

14:10.981 --> 14:13.023
AND... I HATE IT,

14:13.023 --> 14:16.186
SO... I GAVE YOU
THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH

14:16.186 --> 14:17.888
AS A GIFT.

14:17.888 --> 14:20.891
LIKE A LITTLE BASKET TO PUT
ALL YOUR CRAZY IN. (chuckles)

14:20.891 --> 14:22.893
SO MY ATTENTION
IS SO HORRIBLE

14:22.893 --> 14:24.895
THAT YOU THOUGHT
YOU'D DISTRACT ME

14:24.895 --> 14:26.967
BY TREATING ME
LIKE SOME BABY?

14:26.967 --> 14:29.439
WERE YOUR DVDs EVEN STOLEN?

14:29.439 --> 14:31.441
I AM MISSING
"TERMINATOR SALVATION,"

14:31.441 --> 14:33.143
ALTHOUGH TO BE HONEST,

14:33.143 --> 14:35.345
I MIGHT HAVE THROWN IT AWAY
OR--OR BURNT IT.

14:35.345 --> 14:36.977
GO HOME, GRAYSON.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.212
OKAY, WAIT.

14:42.212 --> 14:43.413
COME HERE.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.559
NOW GO.

15:01.531 --> 15:04.374
ARE THOSE THE JEANS
I PICKED OUT?

15:04.374 --> 15:06.506
YEP. IT'S, UH, PART
OF MY APOLOGY.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.039
I SHOULD'VE JUST TOLD YOU

15:09.039 --> 15:11.111
THAT I DIDN'T LIKE
ALL THAT ATTENTION.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.183
MY SON JUST LEFT HOME.

15:13.183 --> 15:15.685
THIS IS SO SCARY,
AND IT'S CONFUSING,

15:15.685 --> 15:18.618
AND IT'S SAD ALL AT ONCE.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.151
IN MY DEFENSE, YOU WERE
REALLY ANNOYING. (chuckles)

15:21.151 --> 15:23.153
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, IT'S--

15:23.153 --> 15:25.155
IT'S NOT FAIR FOR ME
TO SMOTHER YOU

15:25.155 --> 15:27.057
JUST BECAUSE I'M GOING
THROUGH SOMETHING.

15:27.057 --> 15:29.059
CAN I GO CHANGE MY JEANS?

15:29.059 --> 15:31.631
UH, EVENTUALLY I WANT
TO HAVE KIDS.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.604
I MEAN, WE'VE ONLY BEEN DATING
FOR A FEW MONTHS... (chuckles)

15:34.604 --> 15:37.607
SO IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE
TO TAKE CARE OF ME BECAUSE

15:37.607 --> 15:39.609
YOU'RE AN EMOTIONALLY CRIPPLED
HALF-MAN...

15:39.609 --> 15:43.043
(whispers)
I'M NOT GONNA JUDGE.
(whispers) THANKS.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.045
(normal voice) BESIDES,
I'M STRONG ENOUGH AS A WOMAN

15:45.045 --> 15:47.347
TO BE ABLE TO, YOU KNOW,
TAKE CARE OF MYSELF

15:47.347 --> 15:50.120
AND NOT DESPERATELY CLING
TO SOMEONE. (chuckles)
(cell phone rings)

15:50.120 --> 15:52.382
(gasps) IT'S MY BABY!
MY BABY IS CALLING ME!
(ring)

15:52.382 --> 15:55.055
HI. WHAT'S WRONG? THIS ISN'T
OUR ONCE-A-WEEK PHONE CALL.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.027
WHAT'S GOING ON?
HI, MOM.

15:57.027 --> 15:59.029
DO YOU WANT TO QUIT COLLEGE
AND COME HOME?

15:59.029 --> 16:01.191
BECAUSE I WILL TELL
EVERYONE YOU HAVE MONO.

16:01.191 --> 16:03.693
I'M FINE, BUT, UH,
DAD AND ANDY SLEPT HERE,

16:03.693 --> 16:06.036
AND THEY WON'T LEAVE.

16:06.036 --> 16:08.038
ISN'T HE CUTE
WHEN HE SLEEPS?

16:08.038 --> 16:11.171
YOU ONLY CALL
WHEN YOU NEED SOMETHING?
YOU'RE MY MOM.
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

16:11.171 --> 16:14.104
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
NO, NO, NO. DON'T COME HERE.

16:14.104 --> 16:17.247
Don't come here. Don't come
here. Don't come here!
(beep)

16:17.247 --> 16:19.249
TRAVIS WANTS ME
TO COME THERE. (giggles)

16:21.011 --> 16:23.353
IF I CAN GET STAN TO NAP
IN HIS STROLLER,

16:23.353 --> 16:27.587
WE COULD GO GET COFFEE.
OH, I'M SORRY. I'M GONNA BE BUSY
ALL DAY COMMITTING SUICIDE.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.089
(door opens)
ELLIE!

16:29.089 --> 16:30.590
ROSA!
(door closes)

16:30.590 --> 16:32.522
(laughs) OH, BOY.

16:32.522 --> 16:34.464
I CAME TO CHECK ON YOU.

16:34.464 --> 16:36.466
DON'T EVER CHECK ON ME.

16:36.466 --> 16:39.199
IF YOU LOOK IN AND YOU SEE
THAT I'M ON FIRE,

16:39.199 --> 16:41.201
KNOW I WOULD RATHER
ROLL MYSELF OUT.
GOT IT.

16:41.201 --> 16:44.074
I WONDER IF JULES HAS
ANY MORE FOOT WINE.

16:44.074 --> 16:45.605
(door closes, bells jingle)

16:45.605 --> 16:47.107
WHERE'S JULES?

16:47.107 --> 16:49.509
BOO-YAH!
OOH, NICE.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.511
YOU KNOW, GROWING UP
I HAD A COUSIN RUSS

16:51.511 --> 16:54.184
WHO USED TO ROCK
THE HALF-SHIRT.

16:54.184 --> 16:57.347
HONEST TO GOD, HIS ABS WERE LIKE
WAVES IN THE OCEAN. (chuckles)

16:57.347 --> 16:59.349
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

16:59.349 --> 17:02.422
I ONLY KISSED HIM ONCE,
AND IT WAS ON A DARE.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.154
I DARED HIM.

17:04.154 --> 17:06.156
YOUR MOM...

17:06.156 --> 17:08.658
IS HOT.

17:08.658 --> 17:10.660
WAIT. WHY WOULD YOU LET
JULES GO THERE?

17:10.660 --> 17:12.662
DON'T YOU REMEMBER,
SHE TOLD US ALL

17:12.662 --> 17:14.804
SHE'S TRYING TO GIVE TRAVIS
SOME SPACE?

17:14.804 --> 17:18.138
OH, HE KNOWS. HE JUST
DOESN'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED

17:18.138 --> 17:20.370
BECAUSE HE FEELS SMOTHERED.
THAT DOES SOUND LIKE HIM.

17:20.370 --> 17:23.373
JULES NEEDS YOUR HELP. GOSH,
IF YOU WERE HAVING A HARD TIME,

17:23.373 --> 17:26.116
SHE WOULD FORCE HER WAY IN
WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER.

17:26.116 --> 17:28.718
THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED ONCE.
I LOCKED MYSELF IN A BATHROOM,

17:28.718 --> 17:31.050
AND SHE BUSTED IN
ALL D.E.A.-STYLE,

17:31.050 --> 17:34.124
AND SHE WAS LIKE,
"LATER, FRIEND."
MAYBE WE TELL
THAT STORY LATER.

17:34.124 --> 17:37.557
YES, MAYBE WE WILL.
UH, YEAH. CHUCKLES, YOU'VE GOTTA
DECIDE IF YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE

17:37.557 --> 17:40.530
SOMEONE WHO JULES SLEEPS WITH
FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEN DUMPS,

17:40.530 --> 17:43.693
AND WE ALL OSTRACIZE YOU UNTIL
YOU MOVE... (inhales deeply)

17:43.693 --> 17:46.696
OR IF YOU'RE GONNA BE SOMEONE
WHO CAN BE REALLY THERE FOR HER.

17:46.696 --> 17:49.199
AND THAT MEANS BEING PART
OF THE CRAZY--

17:49.199 --> 17:51.101
ALL OF IT.

17:52.442 --> 17:54.804
YEAH, CHUCKLES.

17:56.606 --> 17:58.108
OKAY, YOU WATCH.

17:58.108 --> 18:01.181
WE'RE GONNA FIND YOU A CUTE GIRL
IN THIS FRESHMAN FACEBOOK.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.283
GOOD, BECAUSE WHENEVER
I SEE A GIRL,

18:03.283 --> 18:07.457
I'M ALWAYS LIKE, "WHAT WOULD
MOM, DAD, AND ANDY THINK?"
OOH! I LIKE SUE KANER.
OH, SHE'S BRINGIN' IT.

18:07.457 --> 18:09.489
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.
SHE'S FROM TAMPA.

18:09.489 --> 18:12.362
YOU CAN NEVER TRUST A GIRL
FROM TAMPA.
SHE'S RIGHT, TRAV.

18:12.362 --> 18:14.364
YOU SEE THIS SCAR
ON MY NECK? TAMPA CHICK.
(door opens)

18:14.364 --> 18:17.127
OH, GOOD.
MY MOM'S BOYFRIEND'S HERE.

18:17.127 --> 18:20.630
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
JULES, I WANT TO BE MORE THAN
JUST A GUY WHO SLEEPS WITH YOU.

18:20.630 --> 18:24.434
DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN HERE?
SO LET'S SORT
A FEW THINGS OUT, OKAY?

18:24.434 --> 18:26.736
TRAVIS, YOUR MOTHER'S
HAVING A HARD TIME, OKAY?

18:26.736 --> 18:29.339
CALL HER
MORE THAN ONCE A WEEK.

18:29.339 --> 18:32.582
BOBBY, TRAVIS HERE IS
GOING TO COLLEGE, NOT YOU.

18:32.582 --> 18:35.145
ANDY, SERIOUSLY? (chuckles)
DUDE.

18:35.145 --> 18:36.446
AND, JULES?
WHAT?

18:36.446 --> 18:38.288
COME WITH ME.

18:40.250 --> 18:43.153
HEY, I WOKE UP ONE MORNING,
AND MY WIFE WAS GONE.

18:43.153 --> 18:45.155
I KNOW
A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT...
(bells jingle)

18:45.155 --> 18:48.158
BEING LEFT ALONE
IN AN EMPTY HOUSE.
YEAH, WELL,
AT LEAST YOU WERE LEFT

18:48.158 --> 18:50.160
BY SOMEONE
WHO DIDN'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.302
THAT'S SWEET. HEY, LOOK,
I KNOW IT'S SCARY,

18:52.302 --> 18:54.864
BUT IT'S ALSO A NEW CHAPTER.
EMBRACE IT.

18:54.864 --> 18:57.867
I CAN'T. I MEAN, EVERY TIME
I GO UP THERE TO TRAVIS' ROOM,

18:57.867 --> 18:59.369
I AM MISERABLE.

18:59.369 --> 19:01.871
THERE'S NOTHING
THAT CAN CHANGE THAT.

19:01.871 --> 19:03.513
A JAM ROOM!

19:03.513 --> 19:05.475
IT'S AMAZING!

19:05.475 --> 19:08.248
(gasps) OHH. BUT WAIT. WHAT IF
TRAVIS WANTS TO MOVE BACK HOME?

19:08.248 --> 19:11.751
HE'S NEVER MOVING BACK,
JULES.
IT'S TRAVIS.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.224
FINE. BUT UNTIL THEN,
YOU CAN LEAN ON ME.

19:14.224 --> 19:16.856
OHH. MWAH.

19:16.856 --> 19:20.560
AHH. DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING YOURSELF INTO?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.562
NOPE.

19:22.562 --> 19:26.766
(playing "Slow Ride" rhythm)

19:26.766 --> 19:28.768
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.870
WHAT AM I DOING?
IT'S EARLY.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.373
LET'S DOUBLE DOWN
ON THE GIRL TIME.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.875
NO. WHEN YOU LEAVE,
YOU HAVE TO STAY LEFT.

19:35.875 --> 19:39.509
(Andy singing "Slow Ride")
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
I DON'T WANNA BE YOUR FRIEND.

19:39.509 --> 19:42.252
I DON'T WANNA DRINK TEA
WITH YOU

19:42.252 --> 19:44.214
OR HEAR ABOUT
YOUR STUPID DIABETIC MOTHER

19:44.214 --> 19:46.216
AND THE FLUID IN HER LEGS.
DON'T WANT IT!

19:46.216 --> 19:49.219
AND, ROSA, DO NOT PARK
YOUR CAR IN OUR DRIVEWAY.

19:49.219 --> 19:51.521
THIS ISN'T TAMPA!

19:51.521 --> 19:53.693
AND IF YOU
TAKE THIS OUT ON STAN,

19:53.693 --> 19:55.865
YOU WILL GO
TO A SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL

19:55.865 --> 19:57.867
RESERVED FOR MURDERERS
AND PAGEANT MOMS.

19:57.867 --> 20:00.870
YOUR BEST FRIEND TOLD ME
TO BE FRIENDS WITH YOU.

20:00.870 --> 20:02.872
SHE SAID YOU FIRED
YOUR LAST NANNY

20:02.872 --> 20:06.676
BECAUSE SHE KEPT IT
TOO PROFESSIONAL.
WHAT BEST FRIEND?

20:06.676 --> 20:08.978
("Slow Ride" playing)

20:08.978 --> 20:11.681
CHESS WITH A MONKEY, BITCH.

20:11.681 --> 20:15.715
YOU JUST GOT OWNED
AND SERVED. HA!

20:15.715 --> 20:18.348
SORRY I CAME HERE
AND STOLE YOUR THUNDER.

20:18.348 --> 20:20.450
EVERY MAN NEEDS TO CREATE
HIS OWN THUNDER.

20:20.450 --> 20:24.223
MAN, IT'D BE COOL
IF I COULD FART RIGHT NOW.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.426
IT REALLY WOULD.
ALL RIGHT.

20:26.426 --> 20:30.330
NOW GET OUT THERE AND MAKE
A NAME FOR YOURSELF.
WAIT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

20:30.330 --> 20:33.833
IT'S NOT MY CART.
GO, GO, GO! GO! WHOO!

20:33.833 --> 20:35.705
(tires screech)
в™Є SLOW RIDE в™Є

20:35.705 --> 20:38.838
WHAT UP, KEV?
в™Є TAKE IT EASY в™Є

20:38.838 --> 20:41.911
SQUARE HEAD IS
KIND OF A QUIET BADASS.

20:41.911 --> 20:44.013
в™Є SLOW RIDE в™Є

20:45.475 --> 20:48.518
в™Є TAKE IT EASY в™Є

20:49.849 --> 20:52.021
в™Є SLOW RIDE в™Є

20:53.853 --> 20:55.725
в™Є SLEAZY в™Є

20:55.725 --> 20:57.887
WHOO!

20:57.887 --> 21:00.730
SARASOTA, GOOD NIGHT!

21:08.898 --> 21:12.302
(high-pitched voice)
AH! AH! AH! AH!

21:12.302 --> 21:15.475
AH! AH! AH!

21:15.475 --> 21:17.647
AH! AH!

21:17.647 --> 21:20.650
AH! AH! AH!

21:20.650 --> 21:22.812
AH! AH! AH!

21:22.812 --> 21:25.315
(normal voice) HIGH SCORE!
(buzzer, beeping)

21:25.315 --> 21:27.317
DID I MAKE THE NOISE?

21:27.317 --> 21:29.689
NOPE. PLAY AGAIN.
I WANT TO VIDEO THIS.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.691
(electronic whir)

21:31.691 --> 21:35.465
(high-pitched voice)
AH! AH! AH!

21:35.465 --> 21:38.027
AH! AH!
