{\an8}Freddie, you know
this school has a strict rule

00:17.717 --> 00:20.720
{\an8}against turning your locker
into a time machine.

00:20.787 --> 00:23.189
{\an8}-It's a surveillance system.
-For?

00:23.256 --> 00:24.924
{\an8}Someone snuck
into my locker yesterday

00:24.991 --> 00:27.727
{\an8}and stole
my fruit-scented markers.

00:27.794 --> 00:29.429
So the next time
someone breaks in,

00:29.496 --> 00:31.398
it'll trigger this mechanism

00:31.464 --> 00:33.666
which causes this camera
to snap a picture of the thief,

00:33.733 --> 00:36.569
so I'll know that
you took my markers.

00:36.636 --> 00:38.405

Hmm.

00:51.284 --> 00:53.319

the markers for?

00:53.386 --> 00:54.888

in the teacher's lounge

08:25.071 --> 08:27.340
Absolutely not.

while I recover.

would be so impossible.

for that fire alarm.

an oral report

to read the book?

10:25.624 --> 10:27.460
I was too lazy
to see the movie.

10:29.195 --> 10:30.663

that's gonna be there.

Why is it so hard
to get detention?

-Me.
-Detention!

-Tonight!

-Yay!
-Yay?

Darn.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.684

Yeah, but we still
need our tech producer

and school's over
in three minutes.

in three minutes?

11:03.095 --> 11:05.231
I don't mind stopping
by Crusty Creme.

11:05.297 --> 11:06.665
I--

11:08.334 --> 11:10.169
[laughs]

11:10.236 --> 11:12.938
You heard I got
the new pear phone.

11:13.672 --> 11:16.208
Yep, these babies
are indestructible.

11:18.477 --> 11:19.779
Hello, honey. I'm back.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.280
Yes, I will pick up the donuts.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.681
Mm-hmm.

11:26.285 --> 11:27.820
[bell rings]

11:27.887 --> 11:30.289
Aw, man, school's over.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.857
And you didn't get detention.

11:31.924 --> 11:34.493
Which means no "iCarly"
50th web show spectacular.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.795
It couldn't be worse.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.064
-Yes, it could.
-How?

11:38.130 --> 11:39.765
We could be Gibby.

11:41.133 --> 11:43.969
They gave me
another Texas wedgie.

11:55.481 --> 11:58.884
[indistinct chatter]

12:04.623 --> 12:06.158
Man,

12:06.225 --> 12:07.626
when Spencer said
he was building

12:07.693 --> 12:10.963
a gigantic cup of coffee,
he wasn't kidding around.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.765
Where is Spencer?

12:12.832 --> 12:14.233
Hey, Spencer!

12:14.300 --> 12:15.968
[gasping]

12:16.035 --> 12:18.003
I'm here.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.306
Is that thing filled
with coffee?

12:20.372 --> 12:23.909
Just about 500 gallons.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.444
Spencer, that's crazy.

12:25.511 --> 12:28.314
It's okay. It's decaf.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.683
Okay, but why are you in there?

12:30.749 --> 12:32.184
'Cause after I filled it
with coffee,

12:32.251 --> 12:34.086
I dropped my cell phone
in here.

12:34.153 --> 12:36.789
Been trying to find it
for the past two hours.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.157
Wish me luck.

12:38.224 --> 12:40.126
[water splashes]

12:40.192 --> 12:41.994
[knocking at door]

12:42.061 --> 12:45.531
Hey, I figured out a way for us
to do "iCarly" tonight.

12:47.399 --> 12:49.602
Is that a 10 foot tall
coffee cup?

12:51.036 --> 12:52.805
10'2".

12:54.907 --> 12:56.575
I'm not gonna ask.

12:56.642 --> 12:58.644
Just tell us how we're gonna do
the show tonight.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.346
All right. Is there a closet
in the classroom?

13:00.412 --> 13:01.947
-Yeah.
-Good.

13:02.014 --> 13:03.549
And you guys can hide
my tech equipment in there

13:03.616 --> 13:05.084
so Mr. Howard won't see it.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.619
Yeah, but what about you?

13:06.685 --> 13:07.987
You can't be in there
unless you have detention.

13:08.053 --> 13:09.588
You said he's almost never
in the room

13:09.655 --> 13:11.157
'cause he's watching
the geometry channel

13:11.223 --> 13:12.291
in the teacher's lounge, right?

13:12.358 --> 13:13.692
Yeah.

13:13.759 --> 13:15.628
So as soon as he checks roll
and leaves,

13:15.694 --> 13:17.963
you guys give me a signal
and I'll sneak in the window.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.132
But the classroom's
on the second floor.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.670
You can borrow my ladder.

13:25.371 --> 13:26.639
Awesome.

13:26.705 --> 13:28.274
Did I hear you say
you got detention?

13:28.340 --> 13:29.642
-Yeah.
-Should I be concerned?

13:29.708 --> 13:31.777
-Not really.
-Later.

13:36.715 --> 13:38.584
Now, you are all here

13:38.651 --> 13:41.720
because you are the worst
this school has to offer.

13:41.787 --> 13:46.358
I am here because I believe
in punishment and discipline

13:46.425 --> 13:48.360
and I hate you all.

13:48.427 --> 13:49.895
All right.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.697
I will be down the hall
in the teacher's lounge

13:51.764 --> 13:54.466
watching the geometry channel.

13:54.533 --> 13:57.836
While I am gone,
there is to be no talking.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.139
I hope
you have a terrible time.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.009
We're good now
for at least 10 minutes.

14:04.076 --> 14:05.578
Let's go.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.113
Okay, everybody.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.949
We're about to start
the 50th webcast of "iCarly."

14:10.015 --> 14:11.150
You guys into it?

14:11.217 --> 14:12.885
-Yeah.
-Totally.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.720
Okay, wants to be the lookout
in case Mr. Howard came back?

14:14.787 --> 14:15.955
-I'll do it.
-Hey.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.057
-Go signal Freddie.
-Right.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.661
Ca-caw, ca-caw!

14:22.728 --> 14:24.964
-Ca-caw.
-Do it like a bird.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.966
Ca-caw!

14:27.900 --> 14:30.436
Carly, what's the signal
for Mr. Howard's coming?

14:30.502 --> 14:31.737
Dippity-doo.

14:31.804 --> 14:34.139
-Dippity-doo.
-Everybody sit down.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.608
Pull me in!

14:37.276 --> 14:39.545
-Too late.
-Don't--aww.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.581
[leaves rustle]
[groans]

14:44.984 --> 14:46.118
I heard noise.

14:46.185 --> 14:47.920
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

14:47.987 --> 14:50.456
We're just sitting here
having a terrible time.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.891
[both sigh]

14:52.958 --> 14:54.193
Oh, good.

14:54.260 --> 14:58.063
Just sit here and don't move.

15:00.766 --> 15:02.134
I'll get the stuff
out of the closet.

15:02.201 --> 15:03.802
I'll get Freddie.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.208
Ca-caw.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.043
[weakly]
Ca-caw.

15:12.378 --> 15:14.380
Here. You wear the cap-cam.

15:14.446 --> 15:15.981
-Why?
-There's a camera in it.

15:16.048 --> 15:17.650
If jerk-face comes back,
Freddie hides in the closet

15:17.716 --> 15:18.917
and we switch out "iCarly"

15:18.984 --> 15:20.185
to the hidden camera
in your hat.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.687
Cool.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.024
I fell on a shrub.

15:30.829 --> 15:32.464
-Coast clear?
-All clear.

15:32.531 --> 15:34.366
Then we are live on the web

15:34.433 --> 15:37.936
in 5, 4, 3, 2...

15:38.003 --> 15:42.074
[both scream]

15:42.141 --> 15:44.009
-Why did we scream?
-Because...

15:44.076 --> 15:48.647
{\an8}<i>It's "iCarly"'s 50th web show</i>
<i>spectacular.</i>

15:48.714 --> 15:49.915
It's true.

15:49.982 --> 15:52.151
This is the 50th webcast
of "iCarly."

15:52.217 --> 15:54.453
And it is spectacular.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.655
{\an8}<i>Spectacular.</i>

15:56.722 --> 15:58.290
-I'm Carly...
-And I'm Sam...

15:58.357 --> 15:59.625
And maybe you've noticed...

15:59.692 --> 16:01.493
This isn't our usual
"iCarly" studio.

16:01.560 --> 16:02.861
And if you haven't noticed...

16:02.928 --> 16:05.631
Scrape that crud
out of your eyes.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.833
We're webcasting to you
live from our school.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.035
-Room 29...
-Because we got...

16:10.102 --> 16:12.338
{\an8}<i>Detention.</i>

16:12.404 --> 16:13.839
Tell 'em why we got detention.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.808
'Cause we're naughty.

16:15.874 --> 16:18.177
-Dippity-doo!
-Okay.

16:18.243 --> 16:19.978
You just heard our friend
Claire yell dippity-doo.

16:20.045 --> 16:21.413
Which means that
our horrible teacher

16:21.480 --> 16:22.414
Mr. Howard is coming.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.716
I gotta hide.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.017
Freddie's gonna hide
in the closet.

16:25.084 --> 16:26.251
And we're switching
to the cap-cam

16:26.318 --> 16:27.286
in our friend Billy's hat.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.021
Switching to the cap-cam.

16:33.325 --> 16:36.061
I have ears like a hawk.

16:36.995 --> 16:38.230
I distinctly heard laughter

16:38.297 --> 16:39.832
and I hate laughter.

16:39.898 --> 16:41.367
I thought you hated your wife.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.835
Her, too.

16:43.535 --> 16:46.672
Now keep your mouths shut.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.276
Isn't he charming?

16:52.044 --> 16:53.779
Freddie, let's go.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.848
Switching back to the main cam.

16:55.914 --> 16:57.916
Okay. We were talking
about the things

16:57.983 --> 16:59.251
kids do that get 'em detention.

16:59.318 --> 17:00.352
Why, look.

17:00.419 --> 17:01.653
Here's a gold member

17:01.720 --> 17:02.888
of the detention club
right here.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.690
{\an8}It's ninth grader
Rip Off Rodney.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.925
{\an8}Please, call me Rip Off.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.727
So how'd you get detention?

17:08.794 --> 17:10.295
Selling fake hall passes.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.630
Nice.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.198
<i>[screaming, cheering]</i>

17:13.265 --> 17:14.700
And how'd you get caught?

17:14.767 --> 17:17.669
I, uh...I misspelled "hall."

17:18.436 --> 17:20.372
-Two Ls.
-Yeah.

17:21.073 --> 17:22.641
Okay, so you got anything else

17:22.708 --> 17:24.175
to say to the "iCarly" fans
of the world?

17:24.242 --> 17:26.845
Yeah. I got a special
this week on burritos.

17:26.912 --> 17:28.914
Two for six bucks.

17:29.648 --> 17:31.717
And do they contain
quality meat?

17:31.784 --> 17:33.752
No, they do not.

17:33.819 --> 17:37.456
[excited chatter]

17:37.523 --> 17:40.159
And now continuing
with our game of hangman...

17:40.225 --> 17:43.729
JD, it's your turn to guess
a letter or solve the puzzle.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.131
All right, is it...

17:46.198 --> 17:48.434
Mr. Howard eats pants?
<i>[bell dings]</i>

17:48.500 --> 17:50.903
-Correct!
-He certainly does.

17:52.504 --> 17:56.175
Okay. H-o-t--

17:56.241 --> 17:57.342
Dippity-doo!

Uh-huh.

18:09.421 --> 18:13.325
Everybody's so innocent.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.728
Do I smell burritos?

18:18.864 --> 18:21.266
I have a feeling...

18:22.734 --> 18:24.670
Who wrote this?

18:25.771 --> 18:27.873
Who wrote this lie?

18:29.107 --> 18:30.609
Never in my entire life

18:30.676 --> 18:33.145
have I eaten one pair of pants.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.148
Somebody gonna confess,

18:36.215 --> 18:38.951
or do you all wanna do
200 push-ups?

18:39.017 --> 18:40.419
Principal Franklin says

18:40.486 --> 18:42.721
you can't give physical
punishment in detention.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.790
Principal Franklin.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.291
If you ask me,

18:46.358 --> 18:49.461
he's not even fit
to be in charge of this school.

18:49.528 --> 18:52.231
He's weak. Spineless.

18:52.297 --> 18:56.835
Well, I think
I'm just gonna sit here

18:56.902 --> 19:00.305
and stare
at you gutter children

19:00.372 --> 19:02.541
until detention is over.

19:03.375 --> 19:07.012
And I think
I'll add an extra two hours.

19:09.248 --> 19:10.482
Just hang on.

19:10.549 --> 19:12.150
Freddie has a way to get rid
of Mr. Howard.

I heard Mr. Howard

21:46.238 --> 21:49.041
call me a weak, spineless fool.

21:49.107 --> 21:52.411
No, no, no! I said...

21:52.477 --> 21:55.447
Uh, sweet. Stylish.

21:55.514 --> 21:57.015
Cool.

21:57.082 --> 21:58.116
In my office.

21:58.183 --> 22:00.318
-But I--
-Now.

22:00.385 --> 22:03.221
Why does everything
always happen to me?

22:04.990 --> 22:06.725
So now what?

22:06.792 --> 22:09.361
Well, I suppose Mr. Howard
has tortured you all enough.

22:10.595 --> 22:11.897
Go home.

22:11.963 --> 22:15.267
[excited chatter]

22:15.333 --> 22:17.002
Okay, we're just about done.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.804
-I'm Sam...
-I'm Carly...

22:18.870 --> 22:20.405
And I'm Ted.

22:21.773 --> 22:23.075
And thanks for watching

22:23.141 --> 22:25.711
the "iCarly" 50th web show
spectacular.

22:25.777 --> 22:27.079
May I?

22:27.145 --> 22:28.814
Second button from the bottom.

22:29.581 --> 22:34.219
{\an8}<i>It's "iCarly"'s 50th web show</i>
<i>spectacular.</i>

22:34.286 --> 22:37.956
Bye! Keep clicking
iCarly.com. Don't forget it.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.691
And we're clear.

22:39.758 --> 22:41.493
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

22:45.430 --> 22:47.999
[laughter]

22:48.066 --> 22:49.568
How fun is this?

22:49.634 --> 22:52.437
It's like a java-cuzzi.

22:52.504 --> 22:54.239
Hey!
Who wants more coffee?

22:54.306 --> 22:56.541
{\an8}-I do!
-Whoo!

22:58.710 --> 23:01.646
{\an8}Yeah!

23:01.713 --> 23:03.949
{\an8}This isn't weird at all.

23:10.388 --> 23:12.891
Hi, Carly. Hi, Sam.
Watch what I can do.

23:17.662 --> 23:21.199
[strumming chords]

23:27.038 --> 23:29.274
"iCarly" rocks.
