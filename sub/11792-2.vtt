>> WELL, TELL US ABOUT YOUR

04:23.560 --> 04:24.879
SCARIFICATION.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.357
>> SKIN WAS PROFESSIONALLY

04:26.360 --> 04:28.385
REMOVED BY A SCALPEL.

04:28.390 --> 04:29.493
LASERS WONT FIX THESE.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.467
>> WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO REMOVE

04:30.470 --> 04:32.495
THEM WITH SKIN GRAFI'S OR

05:02.530 --> 05:04.464
DONE, MEANING ALL THE INK IS AT

05:04.470 --> 05:05.823
THE SAME LEVEL.

05:05.830 --> 05:07.388
IT MAKES LASER REMOVAL MUCH

05:07.400 --> 05:08.389
EASIER.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.503
>> IT SHOULD TAKE ABOUT 6 TO 8

05:09.510 --> 05:10.738
TREATMENTS, AND AFTER THAT, WITH

05:10.740 --> 05:11.775
THE HAIR REGROWING, IT SHOULD BE

05:11.780 --> 05:12.804
UN NOTICEABLE.

>> OH.

05:15.510 --> 05:16.670

05:16.680 --> 05:17.806
PROCEDURES?

05:17.810 --> 05:19.539

05:19.550 --> 05:20.710
THE WAY I LOOK IS THE WAY I FEEL

05:20.720 --> 05:25.419
INSIDE.

05:25.420 --> 05:27.581
I DONT WANT TO CHANGE A THING.

05:27.590 --> 05:29.399
>> WELL, IM SORRY, MR. AND MRS.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.424
MCCLOUD, BUT IF YOUR SON DOESNT

05:30.430 --> 05:31.556
WANT THESE REMOVED, YOU CANT

05:31.560 --> 05:32.959
FORCE HIM TO, EVEN THOUGH HE IS

05:32.960 --> 05:34.029
A MINOR.

05:34.030 --> 05:35.019
>> WERE FULLY AWARE OF THAT,

ONE-SIDED, SON.

05:49.580 --> 05:50.774
WE AGREED TO LET YOU LISTEN TO

05:50.780 --> 05:52.645
THE MUSIC THAT YOU LIKE.

05:52.650 --> 05:53.947
I SAID THAT I WOULD CALL YOU

05:53.950 --> 05:57.044
ENIGMA UNTIL YOUR 18th BIRTHDAY.

05:57.050 --> 05:57.971

WHILE, BUT CARVING THE SIGN OF

06:15.000 --> 06:16.968
THE DEVIL INTO YOUR FOREHEAD IS

06:16.970 --> 06:19.541
GOING TOO FAR.

06:19.550 --> 06:21.575
HIS DARKNESS IS DESTROYING OUR

06:21.580 --> 06:23.468
FAMILY.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.795
>> ONE SET CRYSTAL TUMBLERS WITH

06:54.040 --> 06:56.929
SO YOU BOARD HER ILLEGALLY.

06:56.940 --> 06:58.635
>> NOT ILLEGALLY, BY COURT

06:58.640 --> 06:59.618
