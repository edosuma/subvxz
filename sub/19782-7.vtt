WEBVTT

00:02.476 --> 00:04.234
I'd have to fake a log book.

00:04.237 --> 00:05.301
It's not fraud.

00:05.304 --> 00:06.642
If we get this money,

00:06.644 --> 00:09.779
we can open up a long-term housing unit.

00:09.781 --> 00:11.147
Raelyn's clean.

00:11.149 --> 00:13.416
They give her random
drug tests at her work.

00:13.418 --> 00:15.485
That just means she
hasn't been caught again.

00:15.487 --> 00:16.652
What did you just say?

00:16.654 --> 00:18.254
Move!

00:21.192 --> 00:22.492
There's nothing you can do

00:22.494 --> 00:25.061
except get everybody
in this house screwed.

00:25.130 --> 00:28.631
We've got to cut departments,
we've got to cut entire shifts.

00:28.633 --> 00:30.078
You couldn't get me pregnant!

00:30.081 --> 00:32.067
The one thing a man is
supposed to be able to do,

00:32.070 --> 00:33.136
you couldn't do it.

00:39.144 --> 00:40.543
You need to watch yourself.

00:40.545 --> 00:42.044
- I want to.
- No, no.

00:42.046 --> 00:44.013
You're doing this to yourself.

02:23.648 --> 02:27.416
We just haven't been
where we want to be.

02:27.418 --> 02:30.086
Our fundraising has been...

02:30.088 --> 02:31.687
It's been off.

02:31.689 --> 02:33.356
Some of our biggest cuts are coming

02:33.358 --> 02:35.191
from our corporate donors.

02:35.193 --> 02:39.061
So, more cuts.

02:39.063 --> 02:42.198
Are we talking... staff?

02:42.200 --> 02:43.432
Are there gonna be any layoffs?

02:43.434 --> 02:44.834
Not for you.

02:44.836 --> 02:46.869
Not for me what? Not for me personally?

02:46.871 --> 02:48.638
- Not for me...
- Look, I need you more than ever.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.873
Not for me what?

02:50.875 --> 02:54.110
You are going to have
to let some people go.

02:55.713 --> 02:57.947
Well, before we do that, let
me... let me get out there

02:57.949 --> 03:00.209
and shake some hands, let
me squeeze some checkbooks.

03:00.212 --> 03:02.451
I am open to anything,
but the reality is...

03:02.453 --> 03:04.720
we cut staff or we cut services.

03:04.722 --> 03:07.056
- And we're not...
- If we don't have the staff to cut.

03:07.058 --> 03:09.392
- We're not cutting services.
- It's the same.

03:09.394 --> 03:10.893
- It is not.
- It's the same thing.

03:10.895 --> 03:12.895
If we don't have the
people to do the job...

03:12.897 --> 03:15.464
M-Money comes, and money
goes. You know that.

03:15.466 --> 03:17.833
It comes after bad things happen.

03:17.835 --> 03:20.469
When people feel guilty,
but it's too late to help.

03:20.471 --> 03:22.571
You want me to argue?

03:22.573 --> 03:26.275
If people actually did
things, I wouldn't be here.

03:26.277 --> 03:28.077
You wouldn't be here.

03:28.079 --> 03:31.847
But you and me need to be here.

03:31.849 --> 03:33.616
Okay?

03:33.618 --> 03:35.551
Yeah.

03:41.025 --> 03:43.459
I'm going to do the deal.

03:43.461 --> 03:45.494
Do what deal?

03:45.496 --> 03:47.697
I've got an agreement in principle

03:47.699 --> 03:49.932
to sell a 51% stake in the company

03:49.934 --> 03:52.435
to the manufacturers.

03:52.437 --> 03:55.137
Have you listened to
anything I've told you?

03:55.139 --> 03:56.605
I listened to every word.

03:56.607 --> 03:57.745
- Bull...
- I...

03:57.748 --> 04:00.509
- I made the best decision for the company.
- This isn't what we talked about.

04:00.511 --> 04:01.844
What we talked about,

04:01.846 --> 04:03.612
you said I would have the opportunity

04:03.614 --> 04:06.615
- to explore other options.
- I'm, um...

04:06.617 --> 04:08.250
I'm letting you go.

04:10.054 --> 04:11.932
Let me...

04:11.935 --> 04:14.323
- Let me at least look at the deal you want to...
- You said I had to make cutbacks.

04:14.325 --> 04:16.692
- You were right. Now...
- Damn it, Nick.

04:16.694 --> 04:19.661
You've been around the
company for a lot of years.

04:19.664 --> 04:22.631
- "Been around"?
- So, I'm willing to work out something.

04:22.633 --> 04:24.372
Keep you on the payroll
another six months.

04:24.375 --> 04:26.168
I've been way more than "around."

04:26.170 --> 04:28.170
I've been your partner.

04:28.172 --> 04:30.906
I'm the one who had to watch
it fall apart after Clair left.

04:30.908 --> 04:32.808
Clair...

04:32.810 --> 04:34.810
Clair did not run this company.

04:34.812 --> 04:36.879
Well, she didn't just
run it into the ground.

04:36.881 --> 04:38.647
Forget six months, you take a walk now,

04:38.649 --> 04:40.091
see how the streets treat you.

04:40.094 --> 04:42.184
Now, I'm trying to save
what's left of my business.

04:42.186 --> 04:43.966
I brought you this deal 'cause I had to!

04:44.856 --> 04:46.789
I told you not to touch
it, and like a child,

04:46.791 --> 04:48.457
- you couldn't help yourself.
- Well, you know, you wouldn't understand.

04:48.459 --> 04:49.959
Yeah, yeah, you wouldn't
understand because

04:49.961 --> 04:52.194
you never made a damn
thing in your whole life.

04:52.196 --> 04:53.863
Your entire life, you
never made anything.

04:53.865 --> 04:55.631
You're just another guy
working for a living.

04:55.633 --> 04:57.313
You know, you're just a...

05:54.192 --> 05:57.760
Hey.

05:57.762 --> 05:59.161
Girls go down all right?

05:59.163 --> 06:00.896
Yep. They were fine.

06:00.898 --> 06:03.699
They missed you before bed again.

06:03.701 --> 06:06.268
Everything all right at work?

06:06.270 --> 06:09.939
It's just, you seem to
have been getting home

06:09.941 --> 06:12.308
- later and later the last couple...
- So, what's going on in here?

06:12.310 --> 06:14.310
Well, I was teaching
the girls how to cook.

06:14.312 --> 06:17.012
Might've been nice if you
taught them how to clean up, too.

06:17.014 --> 06:18.714
- Well, I'm s-sorry.
- Well, you're sorry,

06:18.716 --> 06:20.149
- but I still have to do all...
- I would've straightened up,

06:20.151 --> 06:21.150
but Amber couldn't sleep.

06:21.152 --> 06:23.285
And I laid down with them, and I just...

06:23.287 --> 06:25.688
I-I-I drifted.

06:25.690 --> 06:27.857
Yeah.

06:27.859 --> 06:29.525
Long day?

06:31.996 --> 06:34.230
Is something wrong?

06:34.232 --> 06:37.032
I just want to go to
bed like everybody else.

06:37.034 --> 06:38.949
I haven't just been sitting around.

06:38.952 --> 06:41.437
- I didn't say you've been sitting around.
- I've been filling out applications

06:41.439 --> 06:43.139
and taking assessments.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.808
I've been looking for
work practically all day.

06:45.810 --> 06:48.177
And I've been actually
working, Jeanette.

06:48.179 --> 06:50.112
All night.

07:28.019 --> 07:29.818
Guy Eckels called me.

07:29.820 --> 07:31.720
He said you fired him?

07:31.722 --> 07:32.922
That all he tell you?

07:32.924 --> 07:34.223
That all I need to know?

07:34.225 --> 07:37.126
- It's about the company.
- What about it?

07:37.128 --> 07:38.627
You want to know about the company,

07:38.629 --> 07:40.462
- you never should've left.
- What about it?

07:40.464 --> 07:43.566
You know, we saw
the future differently.

07:43.568 --> 07:45.534
Now he's... upset.

07:45.536 --> 07:46.835
He's upset 'cause you fired him.

07:46.837 --> 07:49.138
Well, he told me to sell the company.

07:49.140 --> 07:50.906
Okay.

07:50.908 --> 07:54.443
What do you mean "okay?"

07:54.445 --> 07:56.812
Well, if it's not doing well,
if you can't turn it around...

07:56.814 --> 07:58.881
Well, I'm not selling.
Wh-Why would I sell?

07:58.883 --> 08:00.849
Why would you take a minority position

08:00.851 --> 08:02.318
- in the company...
- He's... he's telling you my business?

08:02.320 --> 08:04.920
No. It's our business!

08:04.922 --> 08:06.655
If you told me, if you'd come to me,

08:06.657 --> 08:07.957
I could've done something about it.

08:07.959 --> 08:09.458
You could've walked away with something.

08:09.460 --> 08:11.794
Well... Well, I'm not...
I'm not trying to walk away.

08:11.796 --> 08:13.562
You didn't fix anything.

08:13.564 --> 08:15.598
I mean... you took a bad deal,

08:15.600 --> 08:18.367
- and you think that's genius.
- Yeah, and what... and what did you do?

08:18.369 --> 08:20.402
What'd you do besides
leave the business,

08:20.404 --> 08:22.371
leave me?

08:22.373 --> 08:24.139
All I wanted was something else.

08:24.141 --> 08:25.474
I wanted a family.

08:25.476 --> 08:27.276
What do you call what we had?

08:27.278 --> 08:30.613
An obsession... Everything
was about furniture,

08:30.615 --> 08:32.748
not about friends or family.

08:32.750 --> 08:35.818
If it was cloth or wood, that mattered.

08:35.820 --> 08:38.787
- No, to have something, to make something.
- Right, that mattered.

08:38.789 --> 08:41.256
That's what this is about,
which one of us can...

08:41.259 --> 08:42.591
make something.

08:42.592 --> 08:44.426
Furniture?

08:44.428 --> 08:46.495
I made life.

08:46.497 --> 08:49.365
You make furniture. You
f... And you know what?

08:49.367 --> 08:51.867
I say it, and it sounds bizarre to me.

08:51.869 --> 08:53.969
- Why are you still in this house?
- I d... I don't even...

08:53.971 --> 08:56.138
- It doesn't even make sense to me!
- Why... Why are you still talking?

08:56.140 --> 08:58.107
You push me away, you
push your child away!

08:58.109 --> 08:59.575
- What don't you have?
- You push your family away!

08:59.577 --> 09:01.410
- All so you can hold on to furniture!
- No. No!

09:01.412 --> 09:02.911
I'm holding onto our life, Clair!

09:02.913 --> 09:04.580
And what you can't
take... That was our life.

09:04.582 --> 09:06.749
- What you can't take...
- No, I don't care!

09:06.751 --> 09:08.584
What you can't take...
That you don't matter.

09:08.586 --> 09:09.952
Hey, you walked away,

09:09.954 --> 09:11.520
and everything that
you think is bizarre,

09:11.522 --> 09:13.822
well, guess what, it
didn't die without you.

09:13.824 --> 09:16.525
Now, I'm... I'm putting together a deal,

09:16.527 --> 09:18.160
- and I got a partner.
- No, you don't.

09:18.162 --> 09:20.729
And I'm gonna see my way out of this.

09:20.731 --> 09:22.431
They're not your partner.

09:22.433 --> 09:24.500
They own the business.

09:24.502 --> 09:27.208
A-And when they want, they
will buy you out cheap.

09:27.211 --> 09:28.904
I mean, the least you could've done

09:28.906 --> 09:30.539
was hold onto your name.

09:30.541 --> 09:31.974
The one thing that matters to you,

09:31.976 --> 09:33.575
for people to speak your name.

09:33.577 --> 09:34.910
You don't even own it anymore.

09:34.912 --> 09:37.313
You don't get to... with me.

09:37.315 --> 09:40.416
Telling you the truth ain't... with you.

09:40.418 --> 09:43.118
You don't get to... with me, Clair.

10:56.767 --> 10:59.405
This message from the Guilford
County Corrections Office

10:59.407 --> 11:01.908
is for... Raelyn Boone.

11:01.910 --> 11:03.977
Please contact us or visit our facility

11:03.979 --> 11:06.779
regarding a nonscheduled
drug and narcotic screening.

11:06.781 --> 11:08.648
Testing is required within 24 hours

11:08.650 --> 11:10.316
of receipt of this message.

11:10.318 --> 11:11.818
Failure to submit to a screening

11:11.820 --> 11:13.486
could result in the automatic issuance

11:13.488 --> 11:15.270
of a bench warrant for your person.

11:15.273 --> 11:17.256
If there are any questions,
please reply directly

11:17.258 --> 11:19.125
to the Guilford County
Corrections Office.

12:15.450 --> 12:17.950
These are all my notes from last year.

12:17.952 --> 12:19.218
They're all there.

12:21.623 --> 12:23.423
These are all of them?

12:23.425 --> 12:25.458
All of them.

12:25.460 --> 12:26.993
Um...

12:26.995 --> 12:29.495
- You have that document that I...
- Yeah.

12:34.035 --> 12:35.968
Okay.

12:35.970 --> 12:39.539
That'll do it.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.908
You're not gonna take it with you?

12:41.910 --> 12:44.043
No, I just needed this signed.

12:44.045 --> 12:46.679
But I appreciate you
digging your book out.

12:46.681 --> 12:48.981
I mean, honestly, half
the people we support,

12:48.983 --> 12:51.250
if I can get them to
show me purchase orders

12:51.252 --> 12:53.119
two months running, it's a miracle.

12:53.121 --> 12:54.887
It's actually nice...

12:54.889 --> 12:56.289
to have people who care,

12:56.291 --> 12:58.891
people like you, Abby.

13:00.995 --> 13:02.695
You two are good, right?

13:02.697 --> 13:05.098
Yeah, w-we're good. We're good.

13:05.100 --> 13:05.932
We're good.

13:05.934 --> 13:07.266
I hope so.

13:07.268 --> 13:09.435
I'm taking a position at Abby's shelter.

13:09.437 --> 13:11.738
You're... You're gonna work for her?

13:11.740 --> 13:13.072
Well, for her non-profit.

13:13.074 --> 13:14.674
Um, her funding comes through,

13:14.676 --> 13:18.144
she's gonna be able to
do some great things.

13:18.146 --> 13:19.812
He didn't even go through my notes.

13:19.814 --> 13:21.147
He knew they were fake.

13:21.149 --> 13:22.515
You think he knew.

13:22.517 --> 13:24.784
He's going to work for Abby's non-profit.

13:24.786 --> 13:26.552
What, that makes him dirty?

13:26.554 --> 13:29.188
People don't cash out by
going to work at a non-profit.

13:29.190 --> 13:30.623
Are you serious?

13:30.625 --> 13:32.391
People are getting
busted every other day

13:32.393 --> 13:34.360
- for skimming charities.
- So then, tomorrow,

13:34.362 --> 13:36.028
he'll go up on the Observer website

13:36.030 --> 13:37.930
with a big-ass headline
over his mugshot.

13:39.134 --> 13:40.733
Is this comical to you?

13:40.735 --> 13:42.769
I'm just surprised you got
such a hard time dealing with...

13:42.771 --> 13:44.971
- Not a hard time.
- People whose compasses are off.

13:44.973 --> 13:47.640
Look, the days of being
appropriate are over.

13:47.642 --> 13:49.208
I get it. I do.

13:49.210 --> 13:51.444
That's where America is right now.

13:51.446 --> 13:53.813
You got no morals, you get rewarded.

13:55.283 --> 13:59.185
But I'm not trying to
win a race to the bottom.

13:59.187 --> 14:01.187
I actually liked it
when the guy in charge

14:01.189 --> 14:03.289
loved his daughters,
was faithful to his wife,

14:03.291 --> 14:06.459
and paid his taxes.

14:09.697 --> 14:12.832
You know, I-I need to take some time off.

14:12.834 --> 14:14.066
Vacation?

14:14.068 --> 14:17.036
I'm gonna start with a vacation.

14:17.038 --> 14:18.871
Go to Vietnam or something like that.

14:18.873 --> 14:20.773
I hear it's really, really pretty there.

14:20.775 --> 14:22.108
Yeah, I've never been.

14:22.110 --> 14:24.877
Well, people say it's pretty.

14:24.879 --> 14:27.914
And then, I'm gonna
take some real time off.

14:29.083 --> 14:30.283
Then what?

14:30.285 --> 14:33.252
Find something more one-to-one,

14:33.254 --> 14:36.656
where I get out of it
the same I put into it.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.291
That's what you want?

14:39.794 --> 14:42.228
What I want is to help kids in need,

14:42.230 --> 14:44.063
or maybe have one of my own.

14:44.065 --> 14:46.599
But since I can't seem to do either...

14:46.601 --> 14:47.995
Now you're giving in.

14:47.998 --> 14:49.535
No. No.

14:49.537 --> 14:53.439
I'm being real. I'm being very real.

14:53.441 --> 14:56.275
Well, for what it's worth...

14:56.277 --> 14:59.378
I think your only problem is...

14:59.380 --> 15:00.813
you care too much.

15:02.350 --> 15:07.620
Well, that seems to be a big problem.

15:09.237 --> 15:12.258
Everett won't let me online,
he won't let me have my phone.

15:12.260 --> 15:14.827
All the doors are
locked, the alarm's on.

15:14.829 --> 15:18.497
He keeps saying he's gonna let
me start camming again but...

15:18.499 --> 15:22.034
I mean, we're screwed, man.

15:22.036 --> 15:25.905
There's a reason that Everett...

15:25.907 --> 15:28.207
You go online, you're
not thinking straight,

15:28.209 --> 15:29.475
you say something stupid...

15:29.477 --> 15:30.776
I wouldn't do that.

15:30.778 --> 15:34.647
This... just... It's crazy right now.

15:34.649 --> 15:36.349
That girl getting snuffed.

15:36.351 --> 15:38.985
I mean, you brought her in,
and now we got to deal with it.

15:38.987 --> 15:40.820
And you know Everett's not
gonna let himself do time

15:40.822 --> 15:42.221
over some stray.

15:42.223 --> 15:43.923
He's gonna do what he's gonna do

15:43.925 --> 15:46.125
to make sure nobody in
here won't say nothing.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.841
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:01.843 --> 16:04.010
I made sandwiches.

16:04.012 --> 16:06.279
Appreciate it.

16:06.281 --> 16:10.483
There's a message for you.

16:10.485 --> 16:12.184
Everything okay?

16:12.186 --> 16:14.620
Just the county calling.

16:14.622 --> 16:17.390
- Did you talk to someone?
- It's on my cell.

16:17.392 --> 16:19.158
What'd they say?

16:19.160 --> 16:21.227
You heard the message.

16:21.229 --> 16:24.463
I have to go down to
court and take a piss test.

16:24.465 --> 16:29.302
Is that... Is that okay to do that?

16:29.304 --> 16:31.604
"Okay to do it"?

16:31.606 --> 16:33.005
I'm on parole.

16:33.007 --> 16:35.908
They can make me do whatever they want.

16:35.910 --> 16:37.476
- You nervous?
- If you want to know

16:37.478 --> 16:39.512
if I've been out at
night getting high...

16:39.514 --> 16:40.846
ask.

16:40.848 --> 16:42.315
Were you?

16:44.919 --> 16:46.919
I love my girls.

16:46.921 --> 16:48.988
Were you getting high?

16:48.990 --> 16:51.824
Those two, they get everything I have.

16:51.826 --> 16:55.094
I'm working two jobs,
16-hour days, for them.

16:55.096 --> 16:56.495
For them.

16:56.497 --> 16:58.197
You think I'm gonna go and mess that up?

16:58.199 --> 16:59.865
- You did mess it up.
- Before.

16:59.867 --> 17:02.034
But... you did mess things up.

17:02.036 --> 17:04.170
I get tested at both of my jobs.

17:04.172 --> 17:06.638
Child services tests
me, and I have county.

17:06.641 --> 17:08.207
That's four tests, four chances they get

17:08.209 --> 17:09.742
to take my girls away.

17:09.743 --> 17:11.777
They don't get to do
anything if you're sober.

17:11.779 --> 17:13.476
'Cause they never
mess up the paperwork

17:13.479 --> 17:14.547
or get a test wrong?

17:14.549 --> 17:16.015
They never get it wrong?

17:18.086 --> 17:19.885
I know a little bit
more about how this works

17:19.887 --> 17:21.787
than you do.

17:26.861 --> 17:30.663
We should... We should get away.

17:30.665 --> 17:34.300
You, me and the girls, just...

17:34.302 --> 17:35.868
Just take a little break.

17:35.870 --> 17:38.504
We could all use one.

17:38.506 --> 17:41.207
There someplace we could take the girls?

17:42.443 --> 17:43.809
You don't have to do that.

17:43.811 --> 17:45.378
I'm not doing anything.

17:45.380 --> 17:48.647
I just want everybody
to be able to relax some.

17:48.649 --> 17:52.418
You don't have to try
and get me out of this.

17:52.421 --> 17:54.676
I never skipped a test.

18:05.132 --> 18:08.405
- Only for a couple hours, okay?
- Why can't we go?

18:08.408 --> 18:10.746
Your auntie's taking
me to a grown-up place,

18:10.748 --> 18:12.181
and you'd get really bored.

18:12.183 --> 18:13.449
I wouldn't.

18:13.451 --> 18:15.184
Now, you don't want Amber to be alone.

18:15.186 --> 18:17.808
You don't want to leave your
sister all by herself, do you?

18:17.811 --> 18:19.488
Mom?

18:19.490 --> 18:20.923
Yeah, honey?

18:20.925 --> 18:22.091
You okay?

18:24.653 --> 18:27.420
- We'll be back in a bit.
- They'll be fine.

18:27.423 --> 18:28.789
Go on in.

19:19.051 --> 19:21.618
Are you all right?

19:21.620 --> 19:24.188
You keep asking isn't
gonna make it all right.

19:28.694 --> 19:32.296
How's it with you? How's it been?

19:32.298 --> 19:35.214
I saw that thing you were taking,

19:35.217 --> 19:40.070
that job assessment
thing... Looked hard.

19:40.072 --> 19:42.139
The hard thing is...

19:42.141 --> 19:47.511
being this age and figuring out
how to take care of yourself.

19:47.513 --> 19:49.479
Think you're gonna be
able to find something?

19:49.481 --> 19:51.448
Something.

19:57.089 --> 19:59.223
Amber'd want to stay with you.

20:03.362 --> 20:05.295
I'm just telling you.

20:06.632 --> 20:09.499
She'd want to be with you.

20:13.272 --> 20:15.639
Jeez... Raelyn.

20:15.641 --> 20:19.943
Ms. Boone.

20:19.945 --> 20:22.613
They do make mistakes...

20:25.774 --> 20:27.140
sometimes.

20:27.143 --> 20:34.258
Okay, follow me, please.

22:45.023 --> 22:46.757
Nicky, lévé!

22:46.759 --> 22:48.158
Ann alé.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.726
Fèt vit lévé.

22:49.728 --> 22:51.561
Présé!

22:51.563 --> 22:52.896
Where are we going?

22:52.898 --> 22:55.298
Yon koté byen lwen isit la.

23:47.686 --> 23:50.821
Gabrielle, I'm hungry.

23:50.823 --> 23:52.022
Quoi?

23:52.024 --> 23:53.590
J'ai faim.

23:58.831 --> 24:01.431
Welcome to the Country Kitchen.

24:01.433 --> 24:03.233
What would you like?

24:15.214 --> 24:19.282
Okay, one chicken and French fry.

24:19.284 --> 24:21.985
And...

24:21.987 --> 24:25.555
Will that be all?

24:29.027 --> 24:30.494
Okay.

24:51.368 --> 24:53.049
When are we going home?

24:58.701 --> 25:01.301
Thank y'all so much for coming in.

25:01.304 --> 25:04.105
And there's no rush at all.

25:37.930 --> 25:39.262
Hey, Ma'am!

25:39.264 --> 25:41.097
- Excuse me! Ma'am!
- Man, I'm starving.

25:41.099 --> 25:42.766
Ma'am, this doesn't cover your check.

25:42.768 --> 25:44.334
Excuse me?!

25:44.336 --> 25:46.369
- Hey, Ma'am!
- Miss, she's trying to talk to you.

25:46.371 --> 25:48.939
Hey, she's trying to ask you something.

25:48.941 --> 25:50.907
Miss, hold on!

25:50.909 --> 25:53.977
Hey, I'm talking to you!

25:53.979 --> 25:55.612
Stop!

26:29.481 --> 26:31.414
Honey.

26:31.416 --> 26:33.450
Raelyn.

26:33.452 --> 26:35.685
Where are you taking
her? I'm her sister.

26:35.687 --> 26:38.521
I want... Could...

26:44.088 --> 26:46.127
In the back of the car is a suspect.

26:46.130 --> 26:48.369
I want you to tell me if
that's the last person you saw

26:48.372 --> 26:50.039
with your child.

26:54.715 --> 26:56.448
Yeah, it's her.

27:04.124 --> 27:06.958
Mon passeport est dans la maison.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.694
Ils le cachent pour
m'empêcher de le prendre.

27:09.696 --> 27:12.864
Dites à Clair de me
laisser rentrer chez moi.

27:12.866 --> 27:14.577
Je dirai rien.

27:14.580 --> 27:16.110
You need to settle down, all right?

27:16.112 --> 27:18.503
- Je dirai rien!
- Don't cause yourself any more trouble!

27:18.505 --> 27:21.773
Settle down! Settle down!

27:25.913 --> 27:27.679
Do you know the suspect's name?

27:27.681 --> 27:29.681
Gabrielle.

27:29.683 --> 27:32.083
Her full name.

27:32.085 --> 27:33.618
Um...

27:33.620 --> 27:35.687
Durand, Gabrielle Durand.

27:35.689 --> 27:37.555
And she was employed here?

27:37.557 --> 27:40.959
She's our nanny. We hired
her a few months ago.

27:40.961 --> 27:42.627
Do you know why she was trying to flee?

27:42.629 --> 27:45.063
Why did she want to do harm to your son?

27:45.065 --> 27:46.431
She... She was stealing.

27:46.433 --> 27:48.066
Now, she tried to break into our safe.

27:48.068 --> 27:50.335
No. We don't know.

27:50.337 --> 27:51.670
She had issues.

27:51.672 --> 27:53.605
"Issues".

27:53.607 --> 27:56.074
I didn't see them at first.

27:56.076 --> 27:58.109
When you meet Gabrielle, I...

27:58.111 --> 28:00.011
I mean, I know how this is gonna sound,

28:00.013 --> 28:02.681
but... when I saw her at the airport,

28:02.683 --> 28:04.349
she was like a light.

28:04.351 --> 28:07.285
You'd never know she was
hiding all these dark things.

28:07.287 --> 28:11.890
Has Ms. Durand ever been
physical with the child?

28:11.892 --> 28:15.927
There was one time when
she shouted at Nicky,

28:15.929 --> 28:17.729
she twisted his arm a little bit.

28:17.731 --> 28:19.331
She had just gotten into the country.

28:19.333 --> 28:23.268
I thought, she
didn't know any better.

28:23.270 --> 28:26.004
And then, I started to see these...

28:26.006 --> 28:27.939
cuts on her,

28:27.941 --> 28:29.474
these marks on her.

28:29.476 --> 28:33.712
And I think she would hurt herself.

28:33.714 --> 28:35.513
She... Gabrielle's from Haiti.

28:35.515 --> 28:38.616
She's... separated from her son.

28:38.618 --> 28:40.260
She didn't... Doesn't have a family.

28:40.263 --> 28:42.420
And I think, you know,

28:42.422 --> 28:45.957
I think that's why
she was... distressed.

28:49.730 --> 28:51.629
What's going to happen to her?

28:51.631 --> 28:53.565
We'll be taking her to
St. Catherine's Hospital

28:53.567 --> 28:54.866
for evaluation.

28:54.868 --> 28:56.103
Is she in trouble?

28:56.106 --> 28:59.671
Depends on her state of mind
when she took your child.

28:59.673 --> 29:01.072
Here.

29:01.074 --> 29:04.242
My direct number.

29:04.244 --> 29:07.579
If you need to contact
me for any reason,

29:07.581 --> 29:08.880
please don't hesitate.

29:08.882 --> 29:10.315
Thank you.

29:13.787 --> 29:15.587
Okay.

29:15.589 --> 29:18.023
I'll see you out.

29:22.062 --> 29:23.862
I need your help.

29:23.864 --> 29:25.663
Raelyn's in jail.

29:25.665 --> 29:27.232
What happened?

29:27.234 --> 29:29.634
Raelyn being Raelyn.

29:29.636 --> 29:32.771
Need to give me a little more than that.

29:32.773 --> 29:34.372
She failed a drug test.

29:34.374 --> 29:37.409
She's probably gonna
lose her kids this time.

29:37.411 --> 29:38.843
You don't know that.

29:38.845 --> 29:42.213
She violated her parole.
She's gonna need a lawyer.

29:42.215 --> 29:45.884
I know that.

29:45.886 --> 29:48.253
I can't help you.

29:48.255 --> 29:50.922
There's no one else.

29:50.924 --> 29:52.223
Carson.

29:52.225 --> 29:53.691
No.

29:53.693 --> 29:54.993
Carson is a good man.

29:54.995 --> 29:57.529
Carson will do what
Laurie Ann tells him.

29:57.531 --> 29:59.097
Laurie Ann won't do anything.

29:59.099 --> 30:02.667
It's you, or it's nobody.

30:02.669 --> 30:05.370
I can't help you, not right now.

30:05.372 --> 30:06.838
I...

30:06.840 --> 30:09.040
I'm taking responsibility
for what happened

30:09.042 --> 30:12.068
to those workers.

30:12.071 --> 30:14.345
What do you mean, you're
"taking responsibility"?

30:14.347 --> 30:17.816
I'm gonna do some jail time.

30:17.818 --> 30:20.752
But you didn't have
anything to do with the fire.

30:20.754 --> 30:23.088
Well, I was the one who
dealt with the housing.

30:23.090 --> 30:24.689
I'm responsible.

30:27.694 --> 30:31.262
Laurie Ann talked you
into taking the blame.

30:31.264 --> 30:34.132
I want to do what's right.

30:34.134 --> 30:35.500
Flail around in public

30:35.502 --> 30:37.302
so people can see what
a "good man" you are?

30:37.304 --> 30:39.938
I'm making up for my mistakes.
You don't respect that...

30:39.940 --> 30:42.073
Whipsawing from being
a drunk to a saint?

30:42.075 --> 30:44.509
Everything you've done
in the last couple months

30:44.511 --> 30:46.444
has been about putting
yourself on display.

30:46.446 --> 30:48.246
You need to think on your own situation.

30:48.248 --> 30:50.115
I'm thinking about my sister's family!

30:50.117 --> 30:51.850
She's in jail. She's got two kids.

30:51.852 --> 30:52.837
She is in jail,

30:52.840 --> 30:54.919
and you're doing some
little morality play?

30:54.921 --> 30:56.387
It's not a play!

30:56.389 --> 30:58.022
It's gonna be real time,

30:58.024 --> 31:00.158
and there are gonna
be real consequences.

31:00.160 --> 31:03.061
I understand that, and I accept it.

31:03.063 --> 31:05.697
You've been trying to
figure out your life?

31:05.699 --> 31:07.132
You got a good life.

31:08.181 --> 31:09.513
Only thing wrong,

31:09.516 --> 31:11.369
you don't want to pay
what little it costs

31:11.371 --> 31:13.471
to live it.

31:20.547 --> 31:23.381
I can't help you.

31:25.047 --> 31:27.781
Way things are going,
you wouldn't want me to.

31:53.349 --> 31:54.948
I don't know anything.

31:54.950 --> 31:56.016
They just took her away.

31:56.018 --> 31:59.119
They didn't say anything to me.

31:59.154 --> 32:01.822
Call the jail, and
they'll tell you her bond.

32:06.262 --> 32:07.294
The girls okay?

32:07.296 --> 32:09.162
They're fine.

32:09.164 --> 32:10.664
- It's sad they have to...
- Yeah.

32:10.666 --> 32:13.133
Yeah. It is.

32:13.135 --> 32:15.235
I can keep them overnight if you need.

32:15.237 --> 32:16.770
That's okay.

32:16.772 --> 32:18.472
It's not a bother.

32:18.474 --> 32:21.408
Before you moved in with Raelyn,
they'd been staying over a lot.

32:22.511 --> 32:23.977
A whole lot.

32:35.824 --> 32:37.057
Dustin.

32:37.059 --> 32:38.492
Let's go.

32:38.494 --> 32:39.893
Go where?

32:39.895 --> 32:42.429
The store, help out.

32:44.033 --> 32:45.599
'Kay.

32:45.601 --> 32:47.401
Come on, Jeremy.

32:47.403 --> 32:48.702
It's cool, right?

32:53.234 --> 32:55.144
Let's go.

33:44.326 --> 33:47.427
You brought that into this house.

33:47.429 --> 33:49.930
You brought that crazy
woman into this house.

33:49.932 --> 33:53.066
- I didn't know.
- How could you not know? How... What...

33:53.068 --> 33:55.235
You couldn't see what
she's doing to herself?

33:55.237 --> 33:57.637
- Never saw that... or didn't care?
- Mnh-mnh.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.700
God, you talked about how
you saw her at the airport,

34:01.710 --> 34:03.310
it was like looking at a bright light?

34:03.312 --> 34:05.716
Well, I've been trying to bring
some kind of light into this house.

34:05.718 --> 34:07.647
You're just so damn
miserable all the time.

34:07.649 --> 34:09.149
You got to bring that woman in here,

34:09.150 --> 34:10.417
you had to have that kid.

34:10.418 --> 34:12.152
He's our son.

34:15.791 --> 34:18.891
If something happened to Nicky...

34:18.893 --> 34:20.393
would you even have cared?

34:27.335 --> 34:29.402
But your business...

34:29.405 --> 34:31.371
That you weep over.

34:38.045 --> 34:42.047
We're... done, yeah?

34:45.286 --> 34:48.789
I need a family.

34:48.791 --> 34:51.224
We can't keep playing this as a way...

34:51.226 --> 34:53.760
I've been trying...
I mean, m-my mother...

34:53.762 --> 34:56.096
Five years ago... You
need to get over it.

35:00.436 --> 35:02.769
We get what we want.

35:02.771 --> 35:06.406
And we get what we deserve.

35:06.408 --> 35:09.543
I'll get what's left of the company.

35:09.545 --> 35:11.311
And you get the kid.

35:11.879 --> 35:13.212
So cold.

35:13.215 --> 35:17.050
Well, what do you want me to say?

35:17.052 --> 35:18.685
Say his name.

35:18.687 --> 35:20.887
Say your son's name.

36:00.930 --> 36:02.897
Stock up... We gonna be a while.

36:02.899 --> 36:03.865
Let's go.

36:03.867 --> 36:05.133
Hold on.

36:05.135 --> 36:06.701
What?

36:06.703 --> 36:09.570
Dustin's got it.

36:09.572 --> 36:13.441
Tell him what you want.

36:13.443 --> 36:15.410
Whatever.

36:15.412 --> 36:18.780
So, get "whatever."

36:18.782 --> 36:21.783
Jeremy's gonna be
here when you get back.

36:21.785 --> 36:25.353
You understand?

36:25.355 --> 36:28.689
Yeah.

36:28.691 --> 36:30.224
Better not keep him waiting.

37:00.356 --> 37:02.156
Hey, I need some help.

37:02.158 --> 37:05.293
- My friend's in the car, and I need some...
- No entiendo.

37:05.295 --> 37:07.328
- Please.
- No te voy a dar dinero!

37:07.330 --> 37:09.597
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, n...

37:26.382 --> 37:28.182
That gonna be all for you?

37:28.918 --> 37:30.785
Yeah.

37:47.837 --> 37:49.337
Do you have a restroom?

37:52.642 --> 37:54.041
Back corner.

39:01.144 --> 39:02.476
I quit.

39:02.478 --> 39:04.378
Kimara, I have a runaway.

39:04.380 --> 39:06.614
I don't work for Project
Open Road anymore.

39:06.616 --> 39:09.217
This kid... I'm pretty sure
he was being trafficked.

39:09.219 --> 39:11.752
You can call somebody
else. You know that, right?

39:11.754 --> 39:13.688
I tried.

39:13.690 --> 39:14.989
I need help.

39:14.991 --> 39:17.325
I remember you telling me

39:17.327 --> 39:20.294
that exploited kids
were old news to the D.A.

39:20.296 --> 39:22.296
This isn't about the D.A.

39:22.298 --> 39:23.931
This is about an under-aged kid

39:23.933 --> 39:25.533
who needs to get into a shelter.

39:25.535 --> 39:29.437
Kimara, help me help him.

39:29.439 --> 39:31.239
Then you can be done.

39:39.349 --> 39:40.962
How old are you?

39:43.820 --> 39:47.021
Are you over 18?

39:47.023 --> 39:50.458
17?

39:50.460 --> 39:52.693
Are you younger than 17?

39:57.800 --> 39:59.634
Do you want to talk to the police?

39:59.636 --> 40:02.770
I don't want to talk to them.

40:02.772 --> 40:05.606
Do you have a place to stay?

40:08.678 --> 40:11.979
Is there anyone you'd
like us to contact?

40:13.689 --> 40:15.849
Do you have any friends?

40:49.018 --> 40:53.254
Écoutez-moi, je vous en prie.
Je ne devrais pas être ici.

40:53.256 --> 40:56.390
Faites venir quelqu'un
qui me comprenne!

40:56.392 --> 40:59.593
Laissez-moi parler à quelqu'un!

40:59.595 --> 41:04.098
Je m'appelle Gabrielle Durand.

41:04.100 --> 41:05.866
Laissez-moi parler à quelqu'un!

41:05.868 --> 41:07.401
Je m'appelle Gabrielle Durand.

41:07.403 --> 41:09.437
Faites venir quelqu'un
qui me comprenne!

41:09.439 --> 41:11.972
Faites venir quelqu'un
qui me comprenne!
