00:06.527 --> 00:09.368
These old Southern homes...

00:09.369 --> 00:12.909
There's so much more to
them than just a house.

00:12.910 --> 00:17.890
There was a tension, like
somebody was watching.

00:18.084 --> 00:22.164
I knew this house contained secrets.

00:22.408 --> 00:26.428
What Pandora did they just unleash?

00:27.759 --> 00:31.529
There was something in this house,
and it was trying to kill me.

00:31.530 --> 00:34.132
[Suspenseful music swelling]

00:34.133 --> 00:36.173

00:38.788 --> 00:41.473
Y'all be careful in this house.

00:41.474 --> 00:42.941

00:42.942 --> 00:45.942
It's full of death.

[Reflective instrumental music]

01:02.600 --> 01:04.280
_.

01:06.229 --> 01:10.365
1991 had been a tough
year for our family.

01:10.366 --> 01:14.736
My stepfather was in insurance
sales, but work had dried up.

01:14.737 --> 01:18.070
And it dried up very quickly.

01:18.071 --> 01:23.374
I felt that I needed to look
beyond what I'd been doing.

01:23.375 --> 01:28.821
I decided to study to be a
preacher and to go to Seminary.

01:28.822 --> 01:34.722
I was very supportive of his decision,
but I knew it wouldn't be easy.

01:35.499 --> 01:40.654
We'd have to take a cut in
pay, and we needed to relocate.

01:40.655 --> 01:42.756
I didn't really want to move.

01:42.757 --> 01:45.309
I was gonna have to go to a new school.

01:45.310 --> 01:51.010
Being uprooted as a teenager
is a painful thing sometimes.

01:53.765 --> 01:57.425
We pulled into the driveway...

01:57.491 --> 02:03.011
And it was really gorgeous,
an old Southern farmhouse...

02:03.014 --> 02:04.772
From, like, the 1750s...

02:04.773 --> 02:05.802
Hi.

02:05.803 --> 02:10.842
With the wraparound porch
and the rocking chairs.

02:10.877 --> 02:14.952
It had been let go down by
the family that owned it.

02:14.953 --> 02:19.254
So it was in our budget
to rent; It was cheap.

02:19.255 --> 02:20.817
Welcome to paradise.

02:20.818 --> 02:23.185
The realtor met us
there when we pulled up.

02:23.186 --> 02:25.452
Come on. Come on, everybody.

02:25.453 --> 02:27.373
Yeah.

02:29.291 --> 02:34.751
To our surprise, the previous
tenants were still there.

02:35.481 --> 02:38.930
They were in the process of moving
out, but they weren't finished.

02:38.931 --> 02:40.564
Come, come, come. Come on.

02:40.565 --> 02:43.633
Come on, come on. Come right in.

02:43.634 --> 02:49.534
Couldn't get it out of my mind that there
was a reason for this house to be cheap.

02:53.959 --> 02:57.300
There was a padlocked door.

02:57.301 --> 03:03.201
Didn't make any sense to have a
padlocked door inside the house.

03:06.206 --> 03:10.839
The realtor was taking me around
the house and letting me know...

03:10.840 --> 03:14.545
What the rules were, so she said...

03:14.546 --> 03:18.247
Please, this rug here in this room, the
owners would like you to leave it there.

03:18.248 --> 03:19.715
It's really old and fragile.

03:19.716 --> 03:25.085
It was a rose-colored large rug
that filled the room pretty well.

03:25.086 --> 03:27.086
No problem.

03:27.087 --> 03:30.627
It's kind of a lovely rug.

03:31.957 --> 03:34.291
The lady was coming
out, and I asked her...

03:34.292 --> 03:37.060
Excuse me. What's behind this door?

03:37.061 --> 03:40.224
She had kind of a
shocked look on her face.

03:40.225 --> 03:43.297
She said, that was my Uncle's room.

03:43.298 --> 03:45.332
He committed suicide in there.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.800
Oh.

03:46.801 --> 03:51.721
Out of respect for him,
please keep it locked.

03:56.093 --> 03:58.733
This is creepy.

04:00.509 --> 04:02.076
A man died in this room.

something about that roof.

[Eerie voices whispering]

04:22.298 --> 04:23.855
Hey!

04:23.856 --> 04:27.291
She said, do not for any reason...

04:27.292 --> 04:29.467
Remove that rock from the door.

04:29.468 --> 04:31.947
Do not let the children play in there.

04:31.948 --> 04:35.252
I really didn't know
what the reason was,

04:35.253 --> 04:38.131
but I was like, okay,
this is a great place.

04:38.132 --> 04:40.485
It's got lots of land
for the kids to play on.

04:40.486 --> 04:43.334
Why would they need to be in there?

04:43.335 --> 04:45.856
Anyway, I... I just noticed the roof.

04:45.857 --> 04:51.757
To speed things up, I decided to give the
old tenants a hand, help them move out.

04:52.274 --> 04:56.714
- Thank you for your help.
- No worries.

04:56.977 --> 04:59.108
As she was walking away, she paused and

04:59.109 --> 05:01.848
turned back and looked
at me, and she said...

05:01.849 --> 05:05.689
Y'all be careful in this house.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.720
It's full of death.

05:11.257 --> 05:15.960
And she jumped in her
truck, and they were gone.

05:15.961 --> 05:18.128
[Echoing] Full of death...

05:18.129 --> 05:21.597
How do you react to something like
that? That's a bomb dropped on you.

05:21.598 --> 05:24.178
[Ominous music]

05:29.170 --> 05:31.405
I couldn't sleep that night.

she said when she was leaving.

[Metal squeaking]

05:48.620 --> 05:52.520
I could see the doorknob turning.

This was very late at
night. Everybody was asleep.

06:10.305 --> 06:12.945
But it stopped.

06:17.054 --> 06:20.114
This was not natural.

06:22.124 --> 06:25.417
So I'm sitting there in my bed thinking
something's about to come around the door.

06:25.418 --> 06:30.218
Something's about to
come around that corner.

06:32.589 --> 06:35.289
And nothing did.

06:37.794 --> 06:40.554
[Unsettling music]

06:43.366 --> 06:46.846
So I got up out of bed...

06:49.205 --> 06:51.006
And I was terrified.

06:51.007 --> 06:54.427
I was absolutely terrified.

be around that corner.

It's behind me now.

[Suspenseful musical flourish]

What was going on in this house?

08:01.643 --> 08:05.183

08:06.382 --> 08:09.951
They're gonna think I'm crazy.

08:09.952 --> 08:15.532
So at that point, I just
decided to keep it to myself.

a lot of dishes to wash.

in the house. That was me.

09:00.168 --> 09:02.268

09:04.739 --> 09:07.274
I would go outside and
play with my brother.

there was a lot of space outside.

09:19.587 --> 09:24.507
I saw the ball go in
a hole in the outhouse.

It seemed the thing to do was to
go in the outhouse and get the ball.

told me not to move that rock.

There was a man hanging in the

I must be seeing things.

12:16.119 --> 12:18.999
I open the door...

And it was gone.

What have I just seen?

What was that?

I was really beginning
to worry about the place.

And I didn't want to
tell anybody about it.

It just really upset me.

became second priority to his life.

Matt was rather trying.

on you, and you realize that,

the man of the house.

different little critter pieces.

standing in the window.

sister, so I waved back.

16:53.648 --> 16:56.719
I have this very close
friend named James,

time to get in that room.

James and I were the
only ones in the house.

17:07.194 --> 17:10.797

completely exposed.

I took my multi-tool and removed the
screws that held the latch on the door.

We don't know what's on
the other side of this door.

your mind is, a man died in here.

- Yeah, I got it.

37:37.691 --> 37:41.568
I could have been its next victim.

37:41.569 --> 37:43.570
[Ominous music]

37:43.571 --> 37:47.108
It's physically attacking the children.

37:47.109 --> 37:48.949
I'm like...

37:48.950 --> 37:52.310
How much more can we do?

37:55.877 --> 37:58.294
I knew it was time to go.

37:58.295 --> 38:01.155
We had to... had to leave there.

38:01.156 --> 38:04.216
It just wasn't safe.

38:05.660 --> 38:09.533
We took the kids, we
packed up our things...

38:09.534 --> 38:12.954
And we were out of there.

38:12.967 --> 38:18.007
She vowed never to return
to that house again...

38:19.870 --> 38:25.770
But she wanted Ken and I to go and clean
it up and make sure it was presentable...

38:25.961 --> 38:29.758
When we gave it back to the owners.

38:29.759 --> 38:33.839
And that made me feel very nervous.

38:37.497 --> 38:40.130
I was in the room that had
the great big rug in it.

38:40.131 --> 38:42.591
[Eerie music]

38:51.706 --> 38:54.290
I pulled the corner of the rug back,

38:54.291 --> 39:00.191
and I see some strange markings
and some writing underneath the rug.

39:04.851 --> 39:07.971
[Eerie voices swelling]

39:09.889 --> 39:13.058
You could see markings and symbols.

39:13.059 --> 39:16.295
Wait. Can you help me over there?

39:16.296 --> 39:19.536
[Eerie voices whispering]

39:23.293 --> 39:25.333
[Music]

39:27.228 --> 39:28.416
_.

39:28.417 --> 39:32.377
Wait. Can you help me over there?

39:38.132 --> 39:42.036
We revealed this humongous Pentagram.

39:42.037 --> 39:44.503
[Eerie voice whispering]

39:44.504 --> 39:48.824
We knew this was a sign of witchcraft.

39:52.713 --> 39:55.716
We didn't even finish
cleaning that room.

39:55.717 --> 39:58.731
We just got out of there.

39:58.732 --> 40:04.632
A few minutes later, a shiny silver
Cadillac pulls up into the driveway.

40:06.294 --> 40:08.629
We had not yet met the landlord.

40:08.630 --> 40:10.932
I was expecting some old...

40:10.933 --> 40:16.833
You know, grumpy old man to
come showing up to get the keys.

40:20.042 --> 40:22.922
The door opens up.

40:28.008 --> 40:31.986
She was so beautiful,
it just seemed unnatural.

40:31.987 --> 40:35.167
[Eerie voice whispering]

40:35.791 --> 40:40.951
And she walked past me
and hardly acknowledges us.

40:44.619 --> 40:50.139
I look back, and two other
women got out of this car.

40:54.735 --> 40:59.314
The blonde lady comes back
through the screen door.

40:59.315 --> 41:02.315
She was just fuming.

41:02.334 --> 41:03.660
She demanded...

41:03.661 --> 41:07.689
What have you all done with this
house? There's nothing here anymore.

41:07.690 --> 41:10.992
She said, there are no spirits here.

41:10.993 --> 41:12.527
They've all left.

41:12.528 --> 41:15.264
There's no spirits here. They've
all left. They've all gone.

41:15.265 --> 41:20.936
She said to the other two, we'll have
to have a seance to bring them all back.

41:20.937 --> 41:22.437
What's going on here?

41:22.438 --> 41:25.798
[Unsettling music swelling]

41:28.113 --> 41:29.878
This is weird.

41:29.879 --> 41:32.021
It seemed like she had aged.

41:32.022 --> 41:35.817
I was mind-boggled. I
didn't know what to think.

41:35.818 --> 41:39.658
Y'all be careful in this house.

41:39.756 --> 41:43.776
Was I looking at the last tenants?

41:46.164 --> 41:47.729
Hey!

41:47.730 --> 41:50.999
Was I looking at the realtor?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.836
This was clarification for me.

41:53.837 --> 41:57.436
These women had been
practicing witchcraft.

41:57.437 --> 42:03.337
Perhaps these are the people
who have always owned the house.

42:06.349 --> 42:10.524
Had they created accidents
and unfortunate suicides...

42:10.525 --> 42:14.245
Filling the house with spirits?

42:15.423 --> 42:17.542
[Engine revving]

42:17.543 --> 42:21.743
I realized I'd never see them again.

42:26.169 --> 42:27.503
You're driving.

42:27.504 --> 42:31.104
[Reflective instrumental music]

42:32.090 --> 42:37.653
The experiences that you go through as
a teenager, traumatic or terrifying...

42:37.654 --> 42:42.600
Are what changes you and
molds you as an adult.

42:42.601 --> 42:48.501
Those four months in that long,
hot summer made me the person I am.

42:48.540 --> 42:52.874
It set me up for everything
that life could throw at me.

42:52.875 --> 42:54.555
