I'd say it was good to see you,

04:07.373 --> 04:10.207
but my truth circuits would overload.

04:10.307 --> 04:14.008
Uh, this is no time for pleasantries, Maximal. No.

04:14.108 --> 04:18.342
I have a matter of some urgency to discuss.

04:18.442 --> 04:19.976
So? Discuss.

04:20.076 --> 04:21.742
But not like this.

04:21.842 --> 04:24.877
In person, I think. Yes.

Neutral territory. Both of us. Alone.

04:28.710 --> 04:31.511
Heh-heh. What makes you think I'd agree to that?

04:31.611 --> 04:36.779
Because what I wish to discuss is a truce.

04:36.879 --> 04:38.879
( dramatic theme playing )

04:56.415 --> 04:59.782
All right, Megatron. You called the meeting.

04:59.882 --> 05:02.282
What's this slag about a truce?

05:02.382 --> 05:06.016
Absolutely true. I assure you. Yes.

05:06.116 --> 05:08.084
Hm. When Predacons talk truce,

05:08.183 --> 05:11.151
it just means they need time to reload their weapons.

05:11.251 --> 05:15.384
Under normal circumstances, yes. But not now.

05:15.484 --> 05:17.685
Things have arisen.

05:17.785 --> 05:21.286
Things which require my undivided attention.

05:21.385 --> 05:23.919
To be blunt, Optimus Primal,

05:24.019 --> 05:27.620
I have no time to waste on Maximals.

05:27.720 --> 05:31.888
Thus, I wish a truce. And you will agree.

05:31.988 --> 05:34.687
Do you take me for a fool?

05:34.788 --> 05:39.522
Heh, no. I take you for a Maximal.

05:46.424 --> 05:50.957
A truce? Oh, for bootin' up coal!

05:51.057 --> 05:54.258
I cannot believe you agreed to this.

05:54.358 --> 05:56.525
What could I do? He was right.

05:56.625 --> 06:00.925
I'm a Maximal. I have to give peace a chance.

06:01.025 --> 06:04.060
No matter how unlikely it seems.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.827
Hm. Do you think this has something to do with

06:06.926 --> 06:08.927
that alien energy anomaly?

06:09.027 --> 06:12.127
It's got to. Megatron's found out something.

06:12.227 --> 06:13.761
Something that's got him so worried

06:13.861 --> 06:16.328
he doesn't even wanna think about us.

06:16.429 --> 06:18.729
Hey, I'm insulted.

06:18.829 --> 06:21.529
Well, in that case, we'd better find out what it is.

06:23.695 --> 06:25.163
Heh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:25.263 --> 06:29.130
You mean I gotta infiltrate that Pred base again?

06:29.230 --> 06:32.064
That might be a truce violation.

06:32.164 --> 06:33.697
Not if he's unarmed.

06:33.798 --> 06:36.998
Oh, thanks a slaggin' skip blade full, pussycat.

06:37.098 --> 06:39.331
The vermin is right.

06:39.432 --> 06:43.166

WASPINATOR: Why is spiderbot taking trans-warp cell?

07:28.573 --> 07:31.407

( beeping )

07:42.810 --> 07:43.910
Huh?

07:44.010 --> 07:45.776
The answer is simple.

07:45.876 --> 07:47.510
( grunting )

07:48.577 --> 07:50.477
I'm leaving.

07:53.578 --> 07:56.511

08:03.146 --> 08:07.346
Heh-heh. That spider has hacked his way into my data tracks.

08:07.447 --> 08:09.547
And obviously, he has his own plans

08:09.647 --> 08:11.247
for dealing with the situation.

08:11.347 --> 08:13.114
Yes.

08:13.214 --> 08:16.215
Normally, I would punish such treachery.

08:16.315 --> 08:17.915
But in this case,

08:18.015 --> 08:21.649
it may be advantageous to let him play out the hand.

08:21.749 --> 08:23.949
But not alone. No.

08:24.049 --> 08:26.917
Blackarachnia, there appears to have been a disturbance

08:27.017 --> 08:28.817
on the trans-warp level.

08:28.917 --> 08:32.451
Would you check it out? Please.

08:32.551 --> 08:35.751
Heh-heh-heh. And now, Optimus Primal,

08:35.851 --> 08:40.652
I believe the next move is yours.

08:42.686 --> 08:45.219
( screaming )

08:45.319 --> 08:48.687
Oh, man, ain't the rule that us hero types

08:48.786 --> 08:51.921
gotta get more dignified transportation?

08:52.021 --> 08:54.021
If you could shed a few kilos,

08:54.121 --> 08:56.154

09:17.358 --> 09:20.659

09:49.230 --> 09:51.797
Megatron. This is Airazor.

09:51.897 --> 09:54.565
Is this the Predacon meaning of a truce?

09:54.665 --> 09:58.431
My dear Airazor, my humblest apologies.

09:58.531 --> 10:02.632
Uh, no doubt you are simply flying a routine patrol, yes.

10:02.732 --> 10:05.766
I shall have the defenses shut down immediately.

10:08.133 --> 10:10.967
COMPUTER: Perimeter defenses deactivated.

10:17.469 --> 10:19.268
That's better.

10:19.368 --> 10:22.302
Yes. Again, my apologies.

10:22.402 --> 10:25.503
But you are in Predacon airspace.

10:25.603 --> 10:28.037
In the interest of continued peace,

10:28.137 --> 10:30.404
I must request that you leave.

10:30.504 --> 10:35.071
Oh, very well.

10:35.171 --> 10:36.904
( caws )

10:38.638 --> 10:41.638
Yeah, heh-heh. We did it.

11:03.108 --> 11:04.409
Heh. I'm tellin' you,

11:04.509 --> 11:06.876
I'd hate to sell encyclopedias in that neighborhood.

11:06.976 --> 11:10.410
Megatron just politely shut down the defenses

11:10.510 --> 11:12.110
and tossed us out.

11:12.211 --> 11:13.944
So you failed.

11:14.044 --> 11:15.611
Absolutely.

11:15.711 --> 11:17.178

12:10.787 --> 12:15.955
Ah, excellent. And now, while Tarantulas is distracted...

12:16.055 --> 12:19.322
Computer, access the trans-warp cell.

12:19.422 --> 12:22.755
Megatron voice code ATT override.

12:22.856 --> 12:24.056
( chuckling )

12:24.156 --> 12:27.590
I have some special programming of my own to add.

12:27.690 --> 12:29.057

12:29.157 --> 12:31.890
( cackling )

12:31.990 --> 12:33.924
( Megatron continues cackling )

12:43.792 --> 12:49.193
Hm. Black ship. Bad place for this white cat.

12:49.293 --> 12:51.127
I have to make it quick.

12:58.062 --> 13:01.462
Do you think Tigatron will be able to get the info, big bot?

13:01.562 --> 13:03.729
All we can do is hope.

13:03.829 --> 13:05.762
We know this planet has mysteries.

13:05.863 --> 13:07.963
The energon, the artifacts.

13:08.063 --> 13:09.997
They're all signs of alien presence.

13:10.097 --> 13:13.464
But now Megatron has discovered something else.

13:13.564 --> 13:15.297
Something big.

13:15.397 --> 13:17.831
We have to know what.

13:32.167 --> 13:34.068
( beeping )

14:03.806 --> 14:05.539
( dramatic theme playing )

14:05.639 --> 14:06.906

14:07.006 --> 14:09.273
By the Matrix.

14:12.074 --> 14:19.108
Well, well, looks like curiosity just claimed another cat.

14:23.308 --> 14:25.443
MEGATRON: There is a storm approaching.

14:25.543 --> 14:28.643
Storm of such magnitude,

14:28.743 --> 14:32.144
of such power, it is beyond imagination.

14:32.244 --> 14:34.143
And to think,

14:34.244 --> 14:37.911
I would once have been satisfied with mere energon.

14:38.011 --> 14:42.079
Hm. To think that my ambitions lofted no higher

14:42.179 --> 14:44.746
than the conquest of Cybertron.

14:44.846 --> 14:47.180
( laughing )

14:50.514 --> 14:53.881
( coughing )

14:53.981 --> 14:56.781
Well, no longer.

14:56.881 --> 14:59.915
For I have been given a glimpse of power,

15:00.015 --> 15:02.449
real power.

15:02.549 --> 15:05.516
And that power shall be mine.

15:05.616 --> 15:07.049
(alarm sounds ) Huh?

15:07.149 --> 15:11.250
TERRORSAUR: Don't even twitch your whiskers, pussycat.

15:11.350 --> 15:14.117
Or I'll fragment your hard drive!

15:14.217 --> 15:17.784
You cannot shoot. We have a truce, remember?

15:17.885 --> 15:20.985
Oh, I remember. But you know my trigger finger.

15:21.085 --> 15:22.485
It just might forget.

15:22.585 --> 15:25.986
Then permit me to jar its memory.

15:26.086 --> 15:28.686

( clattering )

16:04.659 --> 16:06.393

16:17.794 --> 16:19.895
There's the signal.

16:19.995 --> 16:23.462
Tigatron the barbarian is doin' a bailout.

16:25.363 --> 16:26.929

16:45.199 --> 16:49.033
The cat is being overtaken. I will engage.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.467
Maximize!

16:51.567 --> 16:52.734
MEGATRON: Negative, Dinobot.

16:52.834 --> 16:56.834
No weapons. We Maximals will maintain the truce.

16:56.934 --> 16:59.535
But we must stop them.

16:59.635 --> 17:02.502
I know. But we must do it.

17:02.602 --> 17:04.168
Peacefully.

17:05.869 --> 17:07.869
( growling )

17:10.603 --> 17:13.703
Hm.

17:13.803 --> 17:15.804
( dramatic rock theme playing )

17:25.039 --> 17:26.640
How are we gonna handle this?

17:26.739 --> 17:28.540
Improvise with what we've got.

17:31.007 --> 17:32.474
( screams )

17:33.474 --> 17:35.807
( screams )

17:41.942 --> 17:42.942
Huh?

17:43.042 --> 17:45.042
( screams )

17:47.876 --> 17:51.610
( engine sputters )

17:51.710 --> 17:54.144
( screams )

18:02.245 --> 18:03.245
( gasps )

18:14.347 --> 18:15.447
( gasps )

18:15.548 --> 18:18.481
( growling )

18:33.551 --> 18:34.784
( groaning )

18:36.218 --> 18:38.218
( laughing )

18:42.119 --> 18:43.785
( grunting )

18:45.853 --> 18:46.886
( spits )

18:46.986 --> 18:48.120
( Rattrap whistles )

18:51.986 --> 18:53.554
( growls )

18:57.021 --> 18:58.354
( screams )

18:58.454 --> 19:01.454
( grunting )

19:03.022 --> 19:05.155
Peaceful.

19:05.255 --> 19:07.722
Very peaceful.

19:10.557 --> 19:12.557
( Terrorsaur clanking )

19:16.191 --> 19:18.225
Darn! He got away!

19:18.324 --> 19:20.292
It was close, though.

19:20.392 --> 19:21.759
Yes.

19:21.858 --> 19:23.892
And when one is serving bait,

19:23.992 --> 19:27.326
presentation is everything.

19:27.426 --> 19:30.293
( cackling )

19:31.860 --> 19:33.794
( thunder rumbling )

19:35.160 --> 19:38.595
Whoa. Sounds like we got back just in time.

19:38.694 --> 19:42.895
So Tigatron, now that the fun's over, how about filling us in?

19:42.995 --> 19:46.696
Megatron has found a strange Golden Disk

19:46.796 --> 19:48.563
of alien manufacture.

19:48.663 --> 19:50.230
It was activated recently.

19:50.330 --> 19:53.063
That was the energy anomaly I noticed.

19:53.163 --> 19:54.931
Another Golden Disk?

19:55.031 --> 19:57.731
Coincidence? Maybe.

19:57.830 --> 20:02.399
It has moving symbols on it. Megatron has translated them.

20:02.499 --> 20:04.499
Cool! What's it say?

20:04.599 --> 20:07.300
It was designed to be a beacon.

20:07.399 --> 20:11.867
The aliens-- The ones who seeded this planet with energon.

20:11.967 --> 20:15.900
The ones who created that flying island that almost destroyed us.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.401
Yes, what are you saying? What have you discovered?

20:18.501 --> 20:20.468
They're coming.

20:20.569 --> 20:21.569
( gasps )

20:21.669 --> 20:22.569
( gasps )

20:22.669 --> 20:23.635
( growls )

20:23.735 --> 20:26.602
They're on their way here.

20:26.702 --> 20:30.170
And I don't think they're very happy.

20:30.269 --> 20:32.504
Hm.

20:32.603 --> 20:36.938
Well, that's just prime.

20:37.038 --> 20:39.038
( dramatic theme playing )

20:49.340 --> 20:51.373
( dramatic theme playing )
