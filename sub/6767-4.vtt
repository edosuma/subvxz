WEBVTT

00:04.718 --> 00:06.345
So, when's your friend
performing again?

00:06.386 --> 00:07.614
The day after tomorrow.

00:07.654 --> 00:09.087
You guys are gonna
be blown away.

00:09.122 --> 00:10.646
Jimmy's magic is so amazing.

00:10.691 --> 00:12.158
l watch his tricks
over and over,

00:12.192 --> 00:13.454
and l can't figure them out.

00:13.493 --> 00:15.688
l can't figure out how he
has the energy to do it.

00:15.729 --> 00:17.697
clare, he's dying.

00:17.731 --> 00:19.062
He's not dead.

00:19.099 --> 00:20.498
Steve, are you gonna go?

00:20.534 --> 00:22.229
Yeah, l'll come,
as long as l don't have

00:22.269 --> 00:23.634
to swap any body fluids
with him.

00:23.670 --> 00:25.262
l don't know
what you see in him.

00:25.305 --> 00:26.795
lt's not what l see.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.535
lt's what l choose to ignore.

00:28.575 --> 00:30.509
When l go,
l want it to be quick.

00:30.544 --> 00:32.273
Heart attack, orgasm.

00:32.345 --> 00:33.472
-crib death.
-l'm just saying

00:33.513 --> 00:34.844
l don't want
to take forever to die.

00:34.881 --> 00:35.848
lt's depressing.

00:35.882 --> 00:37.611
You know Steve--
always about him.

00:37.651 --> 00:41.781
Well, l really need
your support on this, okay?

00:41.822 --> 00:44.290
l promise the show
will not be depressing.

00:44.391 --> 00:45.551
Kelly, it will be depressing.

00:47.694 --> 00:48.991
Don't worry.

00:49.029 --> 00:51.224
lf l have to shoot
him, he'll be there.

00:51.264 --> 00:53.095
At least, then, he
won't have to worry

00:53.133 --> 00:54.600
about catching anything.

00:54.634 --> 00:56.864
Thanks.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:05.512 --> 01:06.979
Here we go.

01:07.013 --> 01:08.605
Fried egg sandwich.

01:08.648 --> 01:10.513
-oatmeal with bananas.
-Thanks, Nat.

01:10.550 --> 01:13.314
Five by seven
of the new kid in town.

01:15.255 --> 01:16.984
This kid is gorgeous.

01:17.023 --> 01:18.684
His belly button
fell off last week.

01:18.725 --> 01:20.420
Week ahead of schedule.

01:23.363 --> 01:25.888
David, you know
l'm proud of the work

01:25.932 --> 01:27.832
that you did,
but college is important.

01:27.868 --> 01:29.165
Not to me.

01:29.202 --> 01:30.260
Well, to me, it is.

01:30.337 --> 01:31.361
ls that understood?

01:32.406 --> 01:33.771
And another thing.

01:33.807 --> 01:36.071
l don't know why you need
to go and leave the dorm.

01:36.109 --> 01:37.838
How do you expect to
afford this new place?

01:37.878 --> 01:39.971
Look, Dad, l told you--
l'm moving into the house

01:40.013 --> 01:42.277
because l thought l was gonna
be getting another video deal.

01:42.349 --> 01:44.180
My point exactly.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.553
Look, l'm good, all right?

01:48.588 --> 01:49.577
l'm one of the best.

01:49.623 --> 01:51.181
l don't care what MZA thinks.

01:51.224 --> 01:54.022
Have you thought about why they
didn't renew your contract?

01:54.060 --> 01:55.220
Yeah, l have.

01:55.262 --> 01:58.026
l don't think it
has anything to do with me.

01:58.064 --> 01:59.292
Hey, David.
Hi, Mel.

01:59.332 --> 02:00.299
Hi, Donna.

02:00.367 --> 02:01.356
What's going on?

02:01.401 --> 02:03.733
David was just telling
me about school.

02:04.771 --> 02:05.897
He was?

02:05.939 --> 02:07.167
Mm-hmm.

02:07.207 --> 02:09.732
college graduation to look
forward to this year.

02:10.776 --> 02:12.745
Next stop: the real world.

02:14.514 --> 02:15.674
Yeah.

02:15.715 --> 02:16.807
Look, l better get going.

02:16.850 --> 02:18.477
l don't want
to be late for class.

02:20.153 --> 02:21.552
-Thanks.
-Yep.

02:21.588 --> 02:22.885
Excuse me.

02:24.191 --> 02:25.749
You told him you
were in school?

02:25.792 --> 02:27.851
lt's really none
of your business.

02:27.894 --> 02:29.191
David, l think your father
has a right

02:29.229 --> 02:30.560
to know that you
dropped out of school.

02:30.597 --> 02:32.690
Yeah, and l think l have
the right to live my own life.

02:33.967 --> 02:36.333
Later.

02:39.172 --> 02:41.367
David, there's still time
for you to register.

02:41.408 --> 02:42.739
l'll think about it, okay?

02:42.776 --> 02:44.607
Well, l hope so 'cause school
is really important.

02:44.644 --> 02:46.271
Don't give me that.

02:46.313 --> 02:47.837
There's just one more year.

02:47.881 --> 02:49.712
Besides, maybe it's just not

02:49.749 --> 02:51.273
the right time
for your career right now.

02:51.384 --> 02:53.284
Yeah, well, maybe my biggest
problem was carrying you.

02:53.386 --> 02:55.115
lf l'd have been on my
own, l would have already

02:55.155 --> 02:57.020
moved on to the
next project by now.

02:57.057 --> 03:00.356
Well, you're gonna get a chance
to prove that, aren't you?

04:22.609 --> 04:24.509
Still on summer standard time?

04:24.544 --> 04:25.875
Well, break out the java,

04:25.912 --> 04:28.847
because as of today,
mornings don't start at noon,

04:28.882 --> 04:32.181
and weekends are actually
limited to the ends of week.

04:34.621 --> 04:36.088
That's right, kids.

04:36.122 --> 04:39.387
Back by popular demand,
it's the school year.

04:39.426 --> 04:41.155
Freshman orientation...

04:41.194 --> 04:42.923
senior orientation...

04:42.963 --> 04:44.692
disorientation.

04:44.731 --> 04:46.494
Hey, it is called
higher education,

04:46.533 --> 04:48.398
so crack the books,

04:48.435 --> 04:49.595
whip out the Frisbees

04:49.636 --> 04:52.104
and start the countdown
to midterms.

04:52.138 --> 04:55.107
And if it's all flying by
too quickly, relax.

04:55.141 --> 04:57.371
This year, you can
replay each day at 5:00

04:57.410 --> 04:59.435
right here on your
very own news network,

04:59.479 --> 05:01.447
cUTV.

05:02.482 --> 05:03.676
Perfect.

05:03.717 --> 05:05.912
Now all we got to do
is find someone to read it

05:05.952 --> 05:07.579
on the air.

05:07.621 --> 05:09.885
Well, what we need
is someone smart,

05:09.923 --> 05:11.686
sophisticated, nice-looking
and believable.

05:11.725 --> 05:12.987
That's what l like
about newspapers.

05:13.026 --> 05:14.618
No one has
to read them to you.

05:14.661 --> 05:16.060
Yeah, well, no one
reads them anymore.

05:16.096 --> 05:17.563
When we go up,
we're gonna have

05:17.597 --> 05:18.996
-75,000 people watching.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:19.032 --> 05:20.363
l know, we're gonna be on cable.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.391
-You told me 50 times.
-You want to reach the boobs,

05:22.435 --> 05:24.096
-you got to be on the tube.
-lt's nice to know

05:24.137 --> 05:25.604
you're not gonna talk down
to our audience.

05:25.639 --> 05:26.731
That's what anchors are for.

05:26.773 --> 05:28.365
-Audition tapes?
-That's right.

05:28.408 --> 05:29.739
Somewhere in there
is the next Diane Sawyer,

05:29.776 --> 05:31.437
and l don't think we
should hire off just looks.

05:31.478 --> 05:33.810
Not bad ones, anyway.

05:37.684 --> 05:39.743
-He is so beautiful.
-Yeah.

05:39.786 --> 05:41.754
So, what do you think,
about six-foot-three?

05:41.788 --> 05:42.914
Yeah, just like you, Nat.

05:44.090 --> 05:46.217
-oh, l gotta go, l gotta go.
-okay, bye.

05:49.996 --> 05:51.987
Thinking about Michael?

05:53.033 --> 05:54.432
Yeah.

05:54.467 --> 05:58.267
The first year of his life
was the best year of mine.

05:58.304 --> 05:59.430
So, we were

05:59.472 --> 06:01.565
talking about bids for
the renovation, yes?

06:01.608 --> 06:02.632
Yes.

06:02.676 --> 06:03.734
l have three.

06:03.777 --> 06:05.642
Low, middle
and not in this lifetime.

06:05.679 --> 06:06.737
What's next?

06:06.780 --> 06:09.305
Well, l will take
a look at these,

06:09.349 --> 06:10.782
make some calls,

06:10.817 --> 06:13.342
find out who's legit

06:13.386 --> 06:15.183
and who's blowing smoke.

06:15.221 --> 06:16.552
Great.

06:16.589 --> 06:19.183
Well, l got to go to class.

06:19.225 --> 06:20.522
l'll call you later.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.959
okay.

06:24.864 --> 06:26.456
Listen.

06:27.834 --> 06:29.358
What you're doing,
helping me out,

06:29.402 --> 06:30.926
l... l just want to say...

06:30.970 --> 06:32.528
There's no need to thank me,

06:32.572 --> 06:35.598
though it is nice to be
appreciated for a change.

06:36.643 --> 06:38.042
ls it that bad with Diane?

06:38.078 --> 06:41.013
Not that l care what
she thinks of me.

06:41.047 --> 06:42.674
lt's just that her
opinion could influence

06:42.716 --> 06:45.651
a judge's decision on
custody for Michael.

06:48.354 --> 06:49.548
Well...

06:51.558 --> 06:54.652
if it's any consolation...

06:54.694 --> 06:56.525
l think you're terrific.

06:58.298 --> 06:59.890
You know l've fallen for you.

07:00.934 --> 07:02.333
You make it sound like a curse.

07:03.369 --> 07:04.393
lsn't it?

07:06.840 --> 07:07.966
Look, l'd never ask you

07:08.007 --> 07:11.204
to choose between me
and your family.

07:11.311 --> 07:14.075
Whatever happens between us,

07:14.114 --> 07:16.344
it happens with no
strings attached, okay?

07:22.055 --> 07:24.489
Scientists predict

07:24.524 --> 07:27.493
a comet is on course to collide
with Earth some time in the next

07:27.527 --> 07:31.520
130 million years,
ending all life as we know it.

07:31.564 --> 07:33.156
Too upbeat?

07:33.199 --> 07:34.860
Not if you're totally psychotic.

07:34.901 --> 07:36.892
Picky, picky.

07:38.104 --> 07:40.868
Scientists predict

07:40.907 --> 07:43.671
a comet is on course
to collide with Earth

07:43.710 --> 07:45.701
some time in the next 130...

07:45.745 --> 07:48.714
You know,
this is a waste of time.

07:48.748 --> 07:49.737
What are you talking about?

07:49.783 --> 07:51.114
Well, this is all junk.

07:51.151 --> 07:52.345
lt's terrible.

07:52.385 --> 07:54.250
We're never gonna
find an anchor.

07:54.287 --> 07:57.120
We're a bearded lady away
from the big top here.

07:57.157 --> 07:57.953
So, what are we gonna do?

07:57.991 --> 07:59.458
l don't know.

07:59.492 --> 08:01.756
l guess we're just gonna have
to push back our start date.

08:01.795 --> 08:03.194
oh, there's got to be someone.

08:03.296 --> 08:05.423
Well, l'm sure there is, but
not by the day after tomorrow.

08:05.465 --> 08:06.523
Excuse me.

08:07.634 --> 08:09.693
l heard you guys
were auditioning anchors?

08:09.736 --> 08:11.203
Yeah, that's right.

08:11.237 --> 08:12.397
l'm-l'm Mark Reese.

08:12.438 --> 08:13.598
l'm the program director.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.107
Brandon, Walsh, news director.

08:15.141 --> 08:17.200
Tracy Gaylian, greenhorn.

08:17.243 --> 08:20.212
So, do you have a tape?

08:20.246 --> 08:21.372
Nope.

08:21.414 --> 08:22.642
-You ever been on TV before?
-Nope.

08:22.682 --> 08:24.582
She meets the first
two of our requirements.

08:24.617 --> 08:27.381
But you've been in front
of a camera before, right?

08:27.420 --> 08:30.082
Uh, my mom's Polaroid.

08:30.123 --> 08:32.091
Works for me.
Right this way.

08:32.125 --> 08:33.990
Practice tonight,
we'll audition tomorrow.

08:41.134 --> 08:42.226
oh, who is that?

08:42.302 --> 08:43.860
My Aunt Helen.

08:43.903 --> 08:46.997
We went for a carnival
cruise on her 80th birthday.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.099
l think not seeing
Kathy Lee killed her.

08:51.177 --> 08:54.237
oh, puce becomes you.
Very nice.

08:54.314 --> 08:58.216
Gordon always said l was the
master of selective flamboyance.

08:58.251 --> 09:00.981
Which one's Gordon?

09:01.020 --> 09:03.648
He has a kind face.

09:03.690 --> 09:06.454
Like an open invitation.

09:06.492 --> 09:08.187
Well, if it isn't

09:08.294 --> 09:09.784
the angel of mercy herself.

09:09.829 --> 09:11.820
Would you drop it?

09:11.865 --> 09:13.162
Why don't you join us
for dinner?

09:13.199 --> 09:16.600
Thanks, but l don't want
to be pitied.

09:17.637 --> 09:19.696
Sorry.

09:19.739 --> 09:22.105
Don't be.

09:22.141 --> 09:24.132
l better start dinner.

09:30.550 --> 09:32.609
What can l do to help you?

09:32.652 --> 09:34.176
could you get me a knife?

09:34.220 --> 09:36.017
Sure.

09:37.523 --> 09:39.047
No, no, no, not from there.

09:39.092 --> 09:40.957
-From the block.
-oh.

09:42.829 --> 09:44.228
Here you go.

09:44.297 --> 09:45.491
Thank you.

09:45.531 --> 09:46.998
How about l do the lettuce?

09:47.033 --> 09:48.523
Great.

09:48.568 --> 09:51.002
Well, l've shown you
my pictures.

09:51.037 --> 09:52.231
Now can l see yours?

09:52.338 --> 09:54.067
Yeah, l can bring some
next time l come.

09:54.107 --> 09:55.233
Thanks. Right now, though,

09:55.275 --> 09:57.072
l'll settle for the ones
you have on you.

09:57.110 --> 09:58.737
l don't carry any with me.

09:58.778 --> 10:00.211
Why not?

10:00.246 --> 10:02.009
Well, l don't know. l...

10:02.048 --> 10:03.572
l guess anybody l care about,

10:03.616 --> 10:05.413
l see pretty much
every other day.

10:05.451 --> 10:08.545
So, it's not like l'm going
to forget what they look like.

10:08.588 --> 10:09.953
They're mementos.

10:09.989 --> 10:12.423
Your heart. Keepsakes.

10:12.458 --> 10:14.085
Preserve your memories.

10:14.127 --> 10:16.095
Trust me on this.

10:16.129 --> 10:20.156
l guess l never really
gave it so much serious thought.

10:20.199 --> 10:21.826
You know, when l used
to get pictures back,

10:21.868 --> 10:23.495
l'd never even take them out
of the envelopes.

10:23.536 --> 10:26.505
Now l can't wait to see 'em.

10:26.539 --> 10:28.131
When you can't look forward,

10:28.174 --> 10:30.734
looking back gets
real attractive.

10:31.778 --> 10:33.678
ow! oh, God!

10:33.713 --> 10:34.873
Way to go, Jimmy!

10:34.914 --> 10:36.040
That was really smart.

10:36.082 --> 10:37.674
Here's a towel.
Hold it up.

10:37.717 --> 10:38.979
-Hold it up.
-Right.

10:39.018 --> 10:40.485
There you go.
Are you okay?

10:40.520 --> 10:42.147
Yeah. Thanks.

10:45.124 --> 10:48.287
You should... You
should wash that off.

10:48.394 --> 10:50.385
Yeah.

10:52.598 --> 10:54.395
Do you have any cuts
on your hands?

10:54.434 --> 10:57.096
No. No.

10:57.136 --> 10:58.865
Any rashes or anything?

10:58.905 --> 11:00.304
A ripped cuticle?

11:00.373 --> 11:01.601
No, no.

11:01.641 --> 11:03.632
Good.

11:08.281 --> 11:11.546
All this blood, it's infected.

11:11.584 --> 11:13.211
Yes.

11:14.253 --> 11:16.244
l'm sorry.

11:17.724 --> 11:19.055
But...

11:19.092 --> 11:20.821
Kelly, you can't,
you can't get AlDS this way.

11:22.128 --> 11:24.926
l mean, it's one in a million.

11:24.964 --> 11:27.228
lt's one in a billion.

11:27.266 --> 11:29.097
on this, l know.

11:29.135 --> 11:31.103
Yeah.

11:31.137 --> 11:33.230
l'm sure you're right.

11:40.646 --> 11:42.113
There you go.
You're going to be fine.

11:42.148 --> 11:43.672
okay, thanks.

11:43.716 --> 11:45.445
l cannot believe l'm doing this.

11:45.485 --> 11:46.747
Maybe it's destiny.

11:46.786 --> 11:48.276
or maybe lunacy.

11:48.388 --> 11:50.583
Look, Tracy, we're gonna put you
on tape for this, okay?

11:50.623 --> 11:52.113
But don't worry,
it's just an audition.

11:52.158 --> 11:54.092
-So relax and...
-Just look

11:54.127 --> 11:55.788
into the camera
with the red light on it

11:55.828 --> 11:56.954
and act natural.

11:58.998 --> 12:00.431
But they both have red lights.

12:02.135 --> 12:04.399
okay, look at the camera

12:04.437 --> 12:06.132
where the red light
is actually on.

12:06.172 --> 12:07.969
Right.

12:08.007 --> 12:10.100
l knew that.

12:14.080 --> 12:18.016
l'm sure if Mr. Broder
just checks out my reel, he...

12:18.051 --> 12:20.519
No, l-- believe me,
l understand he's busy.

12:20.553 --> 12:22.714
Yes, hello,
this is, uh, Marty Davis.

12:22.755 --> 12:24.416
l-l represent,
uh, David Silver

12:24.457 --> 12:25.981
of David Silver Productions.

12:26.025 --> 12:28.550
okay, thank you.
Thank you very much.

12:39.372 --> 12:40.566
l'm Tracy Gaylian.

12:40.606 --> 12:43.575
For all of us at cUTV,
have a great night.

12:43.609 --> 12:45.702
You said you wanted
''spontaneity.''

12:45.745 --> 12:49.044
l didn't say l wanted
to spontaneously combust.

12:49.082 --> 12:51.209
Hey, Trace, you were great.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.808
Really?

12:52.852 --> 12:55.150
Yeah, for a log.

12:56.656 --> 12:58.590
Hey, uh, Trace,
have you got the uh,

12:58.624 --> 13:00.524
the copy that we're gonna lead
off with tomorrow?

13:00.560 --> 13:02.391
l kind of want to run that
through, uh,

13:02.428 --> 13:04.419
with the copy and the video
as well, all right?

13:04.464 --> 13:05.522
okay.

13:08.434 --> 13:10.163
Uh, Paula.

13:10.203 --> 13:11.500
l'm on it.

13:11.537 --> 13:12.902
Earth to camera Two.

13:12.939 --> 13:15.373
We want the home folks to see
what Tracy is saying.

13:15.408 --> 13:17.603
Last l checked,
she didn't talk with her legs.

13:17.643 --> 13:20.737
l don't know,
they sure speak to me.

13:20.780 --> 13:21.906
ln three,

13:21.948 --> 13:23.006
two...

13:23.049 --> 13:24.949
Good evening.

13:24.984 --> 13:26.679
This is the california
University News.

13:26.719 --> 13:28.619
-l'm Tracy Gaylian.
-Ready to roll tape.

13:28.654 --> 13:29.848
Still on summer standard time?

13:29.889 --> 13:32.585
Well, break out the java,
because as of today,

13:32.625 --> 13:34.650
mornings don't start at noon,
and weekends

13:34.694 --> 13:36.525
are actually limited
to the end of the week.

13:36.562 --> 13:39.258
Roll tape and key VTR-two.

13:39.298 --> 13:40.560
...senior orientation.

13:40.600 --> 13:41.760
Disorientation.

13:41.801 --> 13:43.632
Hey, it is called
''higher education.''

13:43.669 --> 13:45.364
What the hell is this?

13:45.404 --> 13:46.564
oops.

13:46.606 --> 13:48.699
-Wrong source.
-Go to VTR-one.

13:48.741 --> 13:50.606
lt's too late.
lt's already in the sound byte.

13:54.046 --> 13:55.946
You know, when summer ends,
we all feel a little

13:55.982 --> 13:57.449
liked caged animals, don't we?

13:57.483 --> 13:58.609
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

13:58.651 --> 14:00.710
So crack the books,
whip out the Frisbees,

14:00.753 --> 14:02.414
start the countdown to midterms.

14:02.455 --> 14:03.752
Whoa, she's good.

14:03.789 --> 14:04.983
Told you so.

14:05.024 --> 14:06.821
But we never had a doubt,
did we?

14:06.859 --> 14:07.951
No, not me.

14:07.994 --> 14:09.052
...very own news network...

14:21.107 --> 14:22.597
Don't worry, Mel.

14:22.642 --> 14:24.075
oh, we'll find it.

14:24.110 --> 14:25.577
lt's got to be
around here somewhere.

14:25.611 --> 14:27.272
okay, bye.

14:28.548 --> 14:29.981
When you were
babysitting Erin,

14:30.016 --> 14:31.643
she left her favorite
coloring book.

14:31.684 --> 14:33.413
Major meltdown, any sign of it?

14:33.452 --> 14:35.113
No, l haven't seen it.

14:38.257 --> 14:40.088
Donna, did you know
that one out of every

14:40.126 --> 14:42.492
four people newly
infected with HlV

14:42.528 --> 14:45.463
is under the age of 22?

14:45.498 --> 14:47.090
No, l didn't.

14:47.133 --> 14:50.466
lt's become
the number one cause of death

14:50.503 --> 14:52.801
among 25- to 44-year-olds.

14:52.838 --> 14:55.272
Most of them were infected
when they were our age.

14:55.374 --> 14:57.672
Are you okay?

14:58.711 --> 15:01.111
Yeah, l'm fine.

15:02.582 --> 15:03.810
Hello.

15:03.849 --> 15:05.111
Hello, it's Jimmy.
ls Kelly there?

15:05.151 --> 15:06.982
Sure, hold on a second.

15:07.019 --> 15:08.008
lt's Jimmy.

15:09.055 --> 15:11.353
Um, l'll take it in my room.

15:11.390 --> 15:13.381
-okay?
-okay.

15:16.529 --> 15:18.827
Hello.

15:18.864 --> 15:20.024
l feel awful.

15:20.066 --> 15:21.226
Don't.

15:21.334 --> 15:22.562
l'm fine.

15:22.602 --> 15:24.229
lf you want to see my doctor
to get tested,

15:24.270 --> 15:25.669
he says that's no problem.

15:25.705 --> 15:27.605
Jimmy, would you just
forget about it?

15:27.640 --> 15:28.664
l'm okay.

15:28.708 --> 15:31.074
-Yes, go rehearse.
-You're sure?

15:31.110 --> 15:32.077
l can't.

15:32.111 --> 15:33.237
l've drawn a complete blank,

15:33.312 --> 15:35.246
forgotten everything
to the stage fright.

15:35.348 --> 15:36.940
Well, it's good to be
a little nervous.

15:36.983 --> 15:38.746
lt'll give you
the competitive edge.

15:38.784 --> 15:40.411
Well, you're coming by
later, right?

15:40.453 --> 15:43.945
Maybe l can go over my act
with you.

15:43.990 --> 15:47.255
Actually, um, l don't know
if l'm gonna be able

15:47.360 --> 15:48.725
to make it this afternoon.

15:48.761 --> 15:49.921
oh.

15:49.962 --> 15:52.430
School stuff.

15:52.465 --> 15:54.729
Well, tomorrow then,
before the show?

15:54.767 --> 15:58.794
Yeah, l'll try, but, um,

15:58.838 --> 16:00.601
it's the beginning of the year,
you know.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.164
l don't want to fall behind.

16:02.208 --> 16:05.200
Sure.

16:05.244 --> 16:06.871
Listen, so-someone else needs
to use the phone.

16:06.912 --> 16:08.038
l, l'd better go.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.742
l'll call you.

16:10.783 --> 16:13.217
Jimmy, l'll be there
every other day like always.

16:13.286 --> 16:14.218
Whatever.

16:14.287 --> 16:16.881
l-l know you're busy.

16:37.943 --> 16:41.242
25o/o less for the same work?

16:41.314 --> 16:43.043
Low ballers are
a beautiful thing, huh?

16:44.583 --> 16:46.448
This calls for a celebration.

16:46.485 --> 16:48.248
Where should we go to dinner?

16:48.287 --> 16:51.256
oh, dinner, l can't.

16:51.324 --> 16:53.019
Kenny, you promised.

16:53.059 --> 16:54.492
l know, l'm sorry.

16:54.527 --> 16:56.119
l'll make it up to you,
l promise.

16:56.162 --> 16:57.993
But you're canceling.

16:58.030 --> 17:00.863
lt's a parents' night
at Michael's school.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.492
Diane just told me
about it this afternoon.

17:02.535 --> 17:05.095
Listen, you've got to tell me
before we go any further.

17:05.137 --> 17:06.536
Are you really getting
a divorce?

17:06.571 --> 17:07.903
Yes.

17:07.940 --> 17:09.202
Because if you're not,
if you can't do it...

17:09.275 --> 17:12.005
Val, Val, Val,
it's going to happen.

17:12.044 --> 17:13.534
Honey, it's going to happen.

17:13.579 --> 17:15.877
Believe me.

17:20.819 --> 17:24.586
You know, they say women find
married men very attractive.

17:26.692 --> 17:31.629
They're safe and secure
and... committed.

17:31.664 --> 17:33.131
Any truth to the rumor?

17:33.165 --> 17:35.292
Way too much.

17:39.105 --> 17:41.573
l have to look out for Michael's
best interests, you know?

17:42.608 --> 17:45.236
l know.

17:45.277 --> 17:47.575
l just wish you would look out
for mine sometimes.

17:48.614 --> 17:51.048
lsn't that what l've been doing?

17:51.083 --> 17:54.018
Hmm?

17:54.053 --> 17:56.044
Yeah, l know, l'm sorry.

17:56.088 --> 17:58.750
l thought you said
you weren't going to come

17:58.791 --> 17:59.780
between me and my family.

17:59.825 --> 18:03.818
l'm not.

18:03.863 --> 18:07.060
You just can't use them
to come between you and me.

18:15.207 --> 18:16.799
Found it under Kelly's bed.

18:16.842 --> 18:18.207
oh, thank God.

18:18.310 --> 18:19.299
Erin was having a fit,

18:19.345 --> 18:20.937
and naturally it
was Daddy's fault.

18:20.980 --> 18:21.947
oh.

18:21.981 --> 18:23.312
Well, l got to get to campus,

18:23.349 --> 18:26.045
so l'll, l'll walk out with you.

18:26.085 --> 18:28.315
You know, Donna,
l never got a chance to tell you

18:28.354 --> 18:29.321
how much l loved the work

18:29.355 --> 18:31.016
you and David did together.

18:31.056 --> 18:32.023
Thanks.

18:32.057 --> 18:33.615
You guys are really talented.

18:33.659 --> 18:36.093
David's the talent.

18:36.128 --> 18:39.222
l was, um,
just along for the ride.

18:39.298 --> 18:41.323
But l'm sure he told you that.

18:43.335 --> 18:45.963
l'm sorry you two had
a falling out.

18:46.005 --> 18:47.233
Yeah.

18:47.306 --> 18:50.969
Sometimes l think David
sets his sights too high.

18:51.010 --> 18:52.671
Well, at least
he's back in school.

18:52.711 --> 18:54.770
That's where he belongs.

18:54.814 --> 18:57.374
He's not in school, Mel.

18:57.416 --> 19:00.044
What do you mean?

19:01.086 --> 19:03.179
He lied to you

19:03.222 --> 19:05.554
'cause he doesn't think
that you'll understand.

19:05.591 --> 19:09.186
And the truth is
he's dropped out?

19:09.261 --> 19:12.230
He's trying to
find another job.

19:13.933 --> 19:17.630
l'm pretty sure that l
was right to tell you.

19:18.671 --> 19:20.798
Yeah, of course.

19:20.840 --> 19:23.638
Listen, thanks for the book.

19:23.676 --> 19:27.134
Yeah.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.976
Welcome to Sportscenter.

19:31.016 --> 19:33.211
Alongside my tag team
partner Brandon Walsh,

19:33.252 --> 19:34.617
l am merely Steve Sanders.

19:34.653 --> 19:36.644
Steve, l told you l'm not
hiring a sports reporter.

19:36.689 --> 19:37.656
oh, come on,

19:37.690 --> 19:39.419
you're making a huge mistake.

19:39.458 --> 19:41.221
Jefferson, Lincoln, Patrick--

19:41.293 --> 19:43.124
three of the most admired men
in this country.

19:43.162 --> 19:45.562
-Patrick?
-Dan Patrick, ESPN anchor.

19:45.598 --> 19:47.361
Release, rotation, splash!

19:47.399 --> 19:50.061
You can't stop him, you can
only hope to contain him.

19:50.102 --> 19:52.093
Steve, l'm sure you'd be epic,

19:52.137 --> 19:54.571
and if we ever start a sports
report, l'll let you know,

19:54.607 --> 19:56.700
but right now l'm just
focusing on the news.

19:56.742 --> 19:57.709
come on.

19:57.743 --> 19:59.108
The news, huh?

19:59.144 --> 20:00.668
l'll bet you're focusing
on that news anchorwoman.

20:00.713 --> 20:01.737
l'm not getting
into this with you.

20:01.780 --> 20:03.077
Well, why not?

20:03.115 --> 20:05.675
Because it's none
of your business, see?

20:05.718 --> 20:07.413
Hi, guys.

20:07.453 --> 20:08.920
Hey, Val.

20:08.954 --> 20:12.253
Hey, Val, Val, don't you want
to stop and smell the roses?

20:12.291 --> 20:14.725
Nice cliche.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.955
l thought so.

20:16.996 --> 20:19.863
So, who are the flowers from?

20:19.899 --> 20:21.127
-Yeah.
-A secret admirer?

20:21.166 --> 20:22.428
Secret from you guys.

20:22.468 --> 20:23.435
ooh...

20:23.469 --> 20:24.493
You can't stop her.

20:24.537 --> 20:27.028
You can only hope
to contain her.

20:39.985 --> 20:41.577
Hey.

20:41.620 --> 20:44.487
lt's after midnight.

20:44.523 --> 20:46.957
Uh, sorry, can't sleep.

20:48.761 --> 20:50.456
What's wrong, Kel?

20:50.496 --> 20:53.294
Nothing.

20:53.332 --> 20:57.234
Do you want me to make you
some chamomile tea or something?

20:57.269 --> 20:58.236
No, l'm fine.

20:58.270 --> 20:59.294
Go back to sleep.

20:59.338 --> 21:01.363
What's going on?

21:01.407 --> 21:04.035
That's what l'd like to know.

21:08.180 --> 21:12.549
l wasn't gonna tell
you guys, but...

21:12.585 --> 21:14.883
l'm going crazy here.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.353
What?

21:20.225 --> 21:22.887
Jimmy was chopping up
some vegetables,

21:22.928 --> 21:24.953
and he cut his finger.

21:26.565 --> 21:29.557
l went to help him
and l put a towel around it,

21:29.602 --> 21:31.593
but he was bleeding, and...

21:31.637 --> 21:34.663
and l got some
of his blood on me.

21:37.209 --> 21:39.507
Kel, l know you're
freaking, okay, but...

21:39.545 --> 21:43.174
l really... l don't think
you can get AlDS that way.

21:43.215 --> 21:44.648
Do you want me to call my dad?

21:44.683 --> 21:45.877
l'm sure he'll
make you feel better.

21:45.918 --> 21:47.283
lf l can't get it that way,

21:47.386 --> 21:49.217
why is everyone telling me
to call the doctor?

21:49.254 --> 21:52.018
Just peace of mind, you know?

21:54.460 --> 21:58.055
Well, it's not working.

21:58.097 --> 21:59.894
Well, sitting here
by yourself worrying

21:59.932 --> 22:01.695
isn't gonna do any good, okay?

22:01.734 --> 22:03.861
You need to get sleep.

22:03.902 --> 22:06.700
l'll get you
an over-the-counter remedy.

22:06.739 --> 22:08.434
Guaranteed rest.

22:08.474 --> 22:10.032
What's that?

22:10.075 --> 22:11.838
Warm milk.

22:14.279 --> 22:16.247
You guys are the best.

22:16.281 --> 22:17.680
Thanks.

22:17.716 --> 22:19.707
Things will seem better
in the morning.

22:29.261 --> 22:31.058
ls she gonna be okay?

22:33.599 --> 22:35.191
l don't know.

22:43.809 --> 22:45.606
l'm sure you're not
gonna need those.

22:45.644 --> 22:48.977
l mean, it's not like l'm
infected or anything.

22:49.014 --> 22:50.504
l'm probably just overreacting.

22:50.549 --> 22:52.881
But l figure better safe,
you know?

22:52.918 --> 22:53.942
Mm-hmm.

22:53.986 --> 22:56.079
l just got a little blood on me.

22:56.121 --> 22:57.247
Please roll up your sleeve.

22:57.289 --> 22:58.017
Sure.

22:58.057 --> 23:00.719
Did you have a paper cut,

23:00.759 --> 23:02.226
hangnail, scrape?

23:02.327 --> 23:04.386
No, no, nothing like that.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.428
Are you sure?

23:10.469 --> 23:12.767
What is that?

23:12.805 --> 23:15.433
AlDS rash; Kaposi's sarcoma.

23:15.474 --> 23:17.339
l-l'm telling you
l don't have it!

23:20.612 --> 23:21.840
We'll see.

23:23.148 --> 23:25.241
Um, you'd better talk
to your doctor.

24:15.033 --> 24:16.091
-Hi.
-Hi.

24:16.135 --> 24:17.830
Kelly Taylor to see Dr. Stein.

24:17.870 --> 24:20.600
Mm-hmm. He'll be with
you in a few minutes.

24:20.639 --> 24:21.833
Please have a seat.

24:21.874 --> 24:23.273
Thanks.

24:38.056 --> 24:39.717
Hi.

24:39.758 --> 24:40.725
Hi.

24:40.759 --> 24:43.250
Mind if l sit?

24:43.328 --> 24:44.625
What are you doing here?

24:44.663 --> 24:47.530
l heard this amazing story
about this woman

24:47.566 --> 24:49.727
who keeps a rose

24:49.768 --> 24:53.260
hidden in her hair.

24:53.338 --> 24:56.102
Had to see if it was true.

24:56.141 --> 24:57.972
How'd you find me?

24:58.010 --> 24:59.272
l tricked one of your roommates

24:59.378 --> 25:00.709
into telling me where you were.

25:02.047 --> 25:04.948
l can be convincingly dramatic
when the spirit moves.

25:07.152 --> 25:08.210
Are you all right?

25:08.287 --> 25:10.619
Sure.

25:10.656 --> 25:14.183
l know in my head l'm okay.

25:14.226 --> 25:16.990
l just can't help feeling
terrified, you know?

25:17.029 --> 25:20.658
That's how l felt every time
l got tested.

25:24.236 --> 25:26.636
Jimmy, l really want to go
through this alone.

25:29.007 --> 25:30.770
You know it's okay to be scared.

25:30.809 --> 25:32.401
l wish l had been.

25:32.444 --> 25:34.605
Gordon and l would have been
a lot more careful.

25:36.315 --> 25:37.646
What do you mean?

25:37.683 --> 25:41.483
When Gordon and l first got
involved, we were tested.

25:41.520 --> 25:44.785
We were both negative,
so we had unprotected sex.

25:46.458 --> 25:49.018
l was monogamous.

25:49.061 --> 25:51.086
Gordon wasn't.

25:53.131 --> 25:55.497
l can't believe
there's an incurable disease

25:55.534 --> 25:57.195
that kills lovers.

25:59.838 --> 26:01.100
Ms. Taylor,

26:01.139 --> 26:02.800
Dr. Stein will see you now.

26:07.746 --> 26:08.770
Kelly,

26:10.549 --> 26:13.609
it's okay if you want
to turn away from me.

26:16.855 --> 26:18.948
Wish me luck, would you?

26:20.659 --> 26:23.628
come on. Who'd bet
on a billion-to-one shot?

26:33.038 --> 26:34.903
So we close the show
with a ten-second teaser

26:34.940 --> 26:35.998
about tomorrow's broadcast.

26:36.041 --> 26:37.508
-Good, then we're all set.
-Yeah.

26:37.542 --> 26:38.770
You're a natural at this, man.

26:38.810 --> 26:40.107
Well, thanks.

26:40.145 --> 26:42.113
The only question left is
where we go to celebrate.

26:42.147 --> 26:46.948
Well, we could always
go to that, that, uh...

26:46.985 --> 26:48.577
Does she look okay to you?

26:50.522 --> 26:52.956
Hey, Stan, open up
her mike, please.

26:54.059 --> 26:57.392
l can't do this.
l can't do this.

26:57.429 --> 26:59.021
How did l get myself into this?

26:59.064 --> 27:01.328
Uh, Tracy, ''this'' being what?

27:01.366 --> 27:02.958
The show. l can't do it.

27:03.001 --> 27:04.298
Tracy, you're just nervous.

27:04.336 --> 27:05.360
You'll calm down.

27:05.404 --> 27:06.564
No, l'm sorry.

27:06.605 --> 27:07.572
You're gonna have to find
somebody else.

27:07.606 --> 27:08.766
Look, Tracy, l'm sure

27:08.807 --> 27:10.001
that if you just take
a few deep breaths...

27:10.042 --> 27:12.510
l said l'm freaking out!

27:12.544 --> 27:13.738
l need a drink!

27:16.915 --> 27:18.507
Look, Kelly, l know
you're frightened,

27:18.550 --> 27:20.745
but you haven't actually been
exposed to any virus.

27:20.786 --> 27:22.014
But l got his blood on me.

27:22.054 --> 27:23.180
l know.

27:23.221 --> 27:24.950
But you have to accept
that unbroken skin

27:24.990 --> 27:26.218
is a barrier to the disease.

27:26.258 --> 27:29.056
Look, here's how you get HlV:

27:29.094 --> 27:32.029
you share a needle or you
exchange blood, breast milk,

27:32.064 --> 27:34.726
semen or vaginal secretions with
someone who has the virus.

27:34.766 --> 27:36.700
So l'm fine?

27:36.735 --> 27:38.669
Well, exposure to the disease
can't be detected

27:38.704 --> 27:40.399
for between two to 12 weeks,

27:40.439 --> 27:42.407
but if the accident is
as you described it.

27:42.441 --> 27:43.567
l'm sure you've got nothing

27:43.608 --> 27:45.405
to worry about.

27:50.482 --> 27:52.040
Have you ever had an HlV test?

27:52.084 --> 27:53.551
No.

27:53.585 --> 27:54.711
But you are sexually active?

27:54.753 --> 27:58.689
Yes. Not right now,
but l have been.

27:58.724 --> 28:00.624
And did you ask if your partner
had been tested?

28:00.659 --> 28:01.921
No.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.052
Did he ever use drugs?

28:03.095 --> 28:06.963
Actually, um, he did have
a drug problem.

28:06.999 --> 28:08.626
lV drugs?

28:08.667 --> 28:10.897
No, not that l know of.

28:10.936 --> 28:11.960
Did he use a condom?

28:12.004 --> 28:13.767
-Yes.
-Every time?

28:13.805 --> 28:14.794
Mm-hmm.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.569
Every single time ever?

28:18.276 --> 28:19.800
Ever?

28:19.845 --> 28:23.212
All right, listen, Kelly.

28:23.248 --> 28:25.716
You can't get AlDS

28:25.751 --> 28:28.743
from sweat or spit or touching
someone with HlV.

28:28.787 --> 28:30.311
You can't get it
from drinking out

28:30.355 --> 28:32.220
of the same glass,
swimming in the same pool,

28:32.290 --> 28:34.690
or using the same toilet seat.

28:34.726 --> 28:37.559
But you can get it
from unprotected sex.

28:37.596 --> 28:39.120
lt only takes one time.

28:39.164 --> 28:42.156
l'm sure l'm fine.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.634
Well, l'm sure you're fine, too.

28:44.669 --> 28:47.604
Then why am l so scared?

28:47.639 --> 28:50.904
Because everything having to do
with this disease is terrifying.

28:50.942 --> 28:54.241
That's why you should
be tested regularly.

28:54.279 --> 28:56.406
So you'll have nothing
to be afraid of.

28:56.448 --> 28:59.747
So let's start a test, Kelly.

29:04.723 --> 29:08.591
l got some bids here from
some general contractors.

29:08.627 --> 29:11.118
$85,000?
A hundred thousand?

29:11.163 --> 29:14.189
You're kidding right?

29:14.232 --> 29:15.995
They're just estimates.

29:16.034 --> 29:18.002
Did you get my flowers?

29:18.036 --> 29:20.027
Yes.

29:22.307 --> 29:23.706
They're beautiful. Thank you.

29:25.911 --> 29:28.778
So do you really think we could
raise that much money?

29:28.814 --> 29:31.009
You know there's this guy
that l know.

29:31.049 --> 29:34.314
He's been married six times
and he swears by yellow roses.

29:34.352 --> 29:37.185
Says you can't go wrong.

29:37.222 --> 29:40.555
He's been married six times
and you trust his judgment?

29:40.592 --> 29:42.560
Practice makes perfect.

29:43.829 --> 29:45.922
l also made dinner reservations
for us for tonight

29:45.964 --> 29:49.365
at a restaurant
that he recommended.

29:51.803 --> 29:53.828
What a difference a day makes.

30:00.011 --> 30:02.241
So what do you think?

30:02.280 --> 30:04.180
Well, it's a long way
from a dorm room.

30:04.216 --> 30:07.708
Yeah, l needed a change.

30:07.752 --> 30:09.743
And like you said, David,
when you took the place,

30:09.788 --> 30:11.779
you didn't think
you'd be back in school.

30:11.823 --> 30:13.757
The fridge is stocked.

30:13.792 --> 30:15.726
Do you want something to drink?

30:15.760 --> 30:19.252
l mean a pool,
a cabana, a bar area.

30:19.331 --> 30:20.559
lf l were you,

30:20.599 --> 30:22.590
l'm not sure l'd get
any studying done.

30:22.634 --> 30:24.898
Let's see.
We got soda, water, juice...

30:24.936 --> 30:26.801
Then again, who studies
during senior year?

30:26.838 --> 30:27.827
Am l right?

30:27.873 --> 30:30.103
You like lemonade?

30:35.147 --> 30:38.116
l'm trying to give you
an opening here, David.

30:39.151 --> 30:40.448
For what?

30:40.485 --> 30:42.510
l'm not supporting you
if you're not in school,

30:42.554 --> 30:44.078
and l know you're not in school.

30:49.461 --> 30:50.928
Who told you?

30:50.962 --> 30:52.429
The point is you didn't.

30:52.464 --> 30:56.127
Look, Dad, l was going to
as soon as l got another job.

30:56.168 --> 30:58.432
This is what l want.

30:58.470 --> 30:59.698
can't you understand that?

30:59.738 --> 31:00.727
Fine.

31:00.772 --> 31:02.205
Don't ask me for help.

31:02.240 --> 31:03.366
l'll pay you back.

31:03.408 --> 31:04.500
l said no.

31:06.912 --> 31:09.904
Fine.
l don't need your money anyway.

31:09.948 --> 31:11.074
Good,

31:11.116 --> 31:13.744
because l put a stop payment
on your check.

31:13.785 --> 31:16.447
You want to do this,
you do it alone.

31:28.600 --> 31:29.624
Water...

31:29.668 --> 31:30.726
juice...

31:30.769 --> 31:32.236
and another scotch for the lady.

31:32.270 --> 31:33.828
Yes, please.

31:33.872 --> 31:35.430
You sure about this?

31:35.473 --> 31:37.134
l mean, that is your third.

31:37.175 --> 31:38.142
of course she's sure.

31:38.176 --> 31:39.541
You are sure, aren't you?

31:39.578 --> 31:42.138
-l ever tell you about the farm
l grew up on? -No.

31:42.180 --> 31:45.240
600 of the most beautiful acres
in the central Valley.

31:45.283 --> 31:47.808
Ah, Steinbeck country.

31:47.852 --> 31:49.479
My grandparents were okies.

31:49.521 --> 31:50.818
The Depression wiped them out.

31:50.855 --> 31:52.982
So they put everything
in a truck, crossed the country

31:53.024 --> 31:55.288
and started over.
lmagine that?

31:55.360 --> 31:57.487
Tough stock.

31:57.529 --> 31:59.997
only time my grandma ever cried
was when she found out

32:00.031 --> 32:04.229
l was going to college.
First one in the family.

32:04.269 --> 32:06.567
Boy, l hope you can
hold your liquor.

32:06.605 --> 32:10.132
Yeah, you're drinking that
kind of fast, aren't ya?

32:10.175 --> 32:12.643
You can, right?
Hold your liquor?

32:12.677 --> 32:14.008
l don't know.

32:14.045 --> 32:16.741
First time
l've ever had a drink.

32:16.781 --> 32:19.477
Whose idea was this anyway?

32:19.517 --> 32:20.541
Yours.

32:23.255 --> 32:27.419
Great, got any other
bright ideas?

32:41.640 --> 32:42.698
Any suggestions?

32:42.741 --> 32:43.730
More coffee, black.

32:43.775 --> 32:44.764
l'll bring the pot.

32:44.809 --> 32:46.902
That a boy.

32:46.945 --> 32:48.242
Makeup!

32:48.280 --> 32:51.511
oh.

32:54.919 --> 32:56.409
How do l look?

32:56.454 --> 32:58.718
Tracy, are you sure you
really want to do this?

32:58.757 --> 33:02.693
l mean, we don't want anyone
to be embarrassed, do we?

33:02.727 --> 33:04.058
Lipstick!

33:06.464 --> 33:09.160
oops.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.795
You know maybe ''embarrassed''
isn't quite the right word.

33:12.837 --> 33:14.498
We're on in ten minutes.

33:14.539 --> 33:17.770
oh! l think l'm gonna be sick.

33:17.809 --> 33:19.572
oh, no, no. No, no...

33:27.886 --> 33:31.014
l want you guys to know
that if l test positive,

33:31.056 --> 33:32.683
you don't have to worry,
l'll move out.

33:32.724 --> 33:34.157
Kel, you're fine.

33:34.192 --> 33:36.490
l mean, Dr. Stein even said.

33:36.528 --> 33:38.689
Yeah, l know, but now
l'm more worried about

33:38.730 --> 33:41.494
the guys l've been with
than this little bloodbath.

33:41.533 --> 33:43.057
Would you stop it.

33:43.101 --> 33:45.592
That's easy for you to say,
Donna.

33:45.637 --> 33:46.763
You're a virgin.

33:46.805 --> 33:49.000
l mean, it's time
for me to face up

33:49.040 --> 33:50.871
to the possibilities of this.

33:50.909 --> 33:53.070
l've never asked any guy
l've ever been with

33:53.111 --> 33:54.100
if he's been tested.

33:56.481 --> 33:58.608
l just wish they would call,
you know?

33:58.650 --> 34:00.413
l want to get this over with.

34:05.090 --> 34:06.921
No, l mailed it overnight.

34:06.958 --> 34:09.016
Uh, Mr. Border should have
gotten it yesterday.

34:11.029 --> 34:12.188
okay.

34:12.230 --> 34:13.197
okay, great.

34:13.231 --> 34:15.199
l'll hold.

34:19.771 --> 34:21.898
He got it.

34:21.940 --> 34:23.100
Great, great.

34:23.141 --> 34:26.542
Did he watch it?

34:26.578 --> 34:28.569
Right.

34:30.648 --> 34:33.639
Not s-- not stylish enough.

34:37.522 --> 34:39.513
Mm-hmm.

34:41.525 --> 34:42.754
Yeah, no, sure.

34:42.793 --> 34:44.455
Uh, l'll-l'll keep in touch.
Thank you.

34:51.536 --> 34:53.264
one minute to air, everybody.

34:53.338 --> 34:54.965
one minute.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.132
So what do you think?

34:56.174 --> 34:57.141
She's had six cups.

34:57.175 --> 34:59.109
And?

34:59.144 --> 35:00.475
She threw up six cups.

35:00.512 --> 35:01.479
Wonderful.

35:01.513 --> 35:03.674
Yeah.

35:03.715 --> 35:04.875
Hang onto your hats, kids.

35:04.916 --> 35:07.111
This should be fun.

35:07.152 --> 35:10.781
Mr. DeMille, l'm ready
for my close-up now.

35:11.723 --> 35:13.918
How many fingers
am l holding up?

35:13.958 --> 35:15.585
come on, guys.
Somebody better tell me,

35:15.627 --> 35:16.787
or l'm gonna throw up again.

35:16.828 --> 35:22.198
Here we go, in five, four,
three, two...

35:22.233 --> 35:23.598
Good afternoon.

35:23.635 --> 35:26.399
This is the first edition of
the california University News.

35:26.438 --> 35:27.871
Thank you for joining us.

35:27.906 --> 35:30.238
We begin today
with the first day of school.

35:30.275 --> 35:31.799
Still on summer standard time?

35:31.843 --> 35:34.471
Well, break out the java,
because as of today,

35:34.512 --> 35:36.002
mornings don't start at noon

35:36.047 --> 35:38.515
and weekends are actually
limited to the ends of the week.

35:38.550 --> 35:40.245
Ready to roll tape.

35:40.351 --> 35:41.943
Roll tape and key VTR two.

35:41.986 --> 35:43.180
That's right, kids,

35:43.221 --> 35:45.212
back by popular demand,
it's the school year.

35:45.256 --> 35:46.723
Doing great, kid.

35:46.758 --> 35:47.747
Thanks.

35:47.792 --> 35:49.487
But you don't have to shout.

35:49.527 --> 35:51.688
Hey, it's called higher
education, so crack the...

36:12.650 --> 36:13.742
Hello.

36:15.920 --> 36:17.911
Yeah, just a sec.

36:17.956 --> 36:20.823
The doctor's.

36:20.859 --> 36:22.850
Moment of truth, l guess.

36:26.030 --> 36:28.225
Hello.

36:28.299 --> 36:29.323
This is Kelly Taylor.

36:36.975 --> 36:38.499
Thank you.

36:40.411 --> 36:41.400
Negative.

36:44.716 --> 36:46.445
l told you.

36:50.121 --> 36:51.952
Let's go get ready
for Jimmy's magic show.

37:01.566 --> 37:03.500
l can't believe
how many people called in

37:03.535 --> 37:04.729
saying how much they love Tracy.

37:04.769 --> 37:06.100
A star is born.

37:06.137 --> 37:07.399
Yeah, or uncorked.

37:07.438 --> 37:08.700
Mm-hmm.

37:08.740 --> 37:10.298
Hey, do you mind
if l sit next to Kelly?

37:10.341 --> 37:11.399
-No, no, go ahead.
-Are you sure?

37:11.442 --> 37:12.409
Yeah, yeah, sit.

37:12.443 --> 37:14.343
-Hello.
-Hi.

37:14.379 --> 37:15.971
Hey, l didn't know
you were coming, Mark.

37:16.014 --> 37:16.981
Anything for you, Kelly.

37:17.015 --> 37:18.778
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

37:20.618 --> 37:24.019
David, l know you're upset,
but now's not the time.

37:24.055 --> 37:25.079
l can't believe what you did.

37:25.123 --> 37:26.454
You ruined my life.

37:26.491 --> 37:28.425
Do you think you've had
enough to drink yet?

37:28.459 --> 37:29.790
oh, there you go, Donna.

37:29.827 --> 37:31.590
Just shovel a little more
holier than thou.

37:31.629 --> 37:34.564
Look, l only did
what l thought was right.

37:39.237 --> 37:40.795
You're right. l'm sorry.

37:46.210 --> 37:49.236
So, is, is anything happening?

37:49.280 --> 37:51.043
Nothing.

37:53.051 --> 37:55.451
David, you're very talented.

37:55.486 --> 37:57.113
There's gonna be
plenty of opportunities.

37:57.155 --> 37:59.123
Yeah, after we graduate.

37:59.157 --> 38:01.318
lt won't be so bad.
You'll see.

38:01.359 --> 38:05.796
l'll go, but school has
nothing to do with what l want.

38:05.830 --> 38:07.161
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:07.198 --> 38:08.495
the magic of Jimmy Gold.

38:13.571 --> 38:15.163
Thank you.

38:15.206 --> 38:16.195
Thank you very much.

38:16.307 --> 38:17.365
l'm Jimmy Gold,
and it's an honor

38:17.408 --> 38:18.466
to be performing here.

38:18.509 --> 38:21.034
l want to start tonight
with a volunteer.

38:22.847 --> 38:24.041
How about you, sir?

38:24.082 --> 38:26.482
Steve Sanders,
Uncle Jimmy wants you.

38:26.517 --> 38:27.950
l...

38:27.986 --> 38:28.782
come on, l don't bite.

38:28.820 --> 38:30.481
Go on.

38:30.521 --> 38:31.818
Attaboy.

38:32.991 --> 38:34.549
Steve!

38:37.328 --> 38:38.226
Now, what's your name?

38:38.329 --> 38:39.455
Steve.

38:39.497 --> 38:41.397
okay, Steve, what l need
from you is one bill--

38:41.432 --> 38:43.229
a five, a ten, whatever you got.

38:45.737 --> 38:47.762
A hundred.

38:47.805 --> 38:48.794
Big spender.

38:49.674 --> 38:50.868
okay, Steve, thanks a lot.

38:50.908 --> 38:51.966
How about a warm hand?

38:56.014 --> 38:57.845
okay, seriously, though,
do you have good eyes?

38:57.882 --> 38:59.543
When it comes to my money, yeah.

38:59.584 --> 39:01.882
okay, repeat after me:
You're the straight man.

39:01.919 --> 39:03.546
You could say that again.

39:03.588 --> 39:05.180
Very good.

39:05.289 --> 39:06.313
All right.

39:06.357 --> 39:07.483
Watch closely.

39:17.869 --> 39:18.927
Now what do you see?

39:18.970 --> 39:20.369
l see a one dollar bill.

39:20.405 --> 39:22.066
oh, check your
shirt pocket, Steve.

39:24.776 --> 39:27.404
Hey!

39:31.382 --> 39:33.213
The only thing is

39:33.251 --> 39:35.082
l can't do it the
other way around.

39:35.119 --> 39:36.586
Thanks a lot, Steve.

39:36.621 --> 39:38.054
Thank you.

39:41.392 --> 39:43.417
l-l'd like to try something now

39:43.461 --> 39:44.655
a little more dar--

39:45.797 --> 39:46.729
sorry-- daring.

39:46.764 --> 39:47.753
Um, this...

39:53.004 --> 39:54.096
Sorry. Th--

40:01.579 --> 40:02.841
Drink some water.

40:02.880 --> 40:03.869
You okay?

40:11.622 --> 40:13.783
l guess l had a frog
in my throat.

40:17.361 --> 40:18.726
Whoo.

40:18.763 --> 40:20.890
And how about
a round of applause

40:20.932 --> 40:22.593
for my beautiful
and faithful assistant.

40:22.633 --> 40:23.725
Thank you.

40:37.281 --> 40:41.809
-Hi.
-Hi.

40:41.853 --> 40:44.583
l hope you're hungry.

40:44.622 --> 40:46.021
l ordered
something special for you.

40:48.926 --> 40:50.052
oh, yeah?

40:50.094 --> 40:51.288
Think l'll like it?

40:51.395 --> 40:55.092
l think you'll devour
the whole entire thing.

41:03.141 --> 41:05.507
oh, that's us when
we were sophomores.

41:05.543 --> 41:08.011
God, we look so young.

41:08.045 --> 41:09.012
He's cute.

41:09.046 --> 41:10.843
Someone special?

41:10.882 --> 41:12.110
Yes.

41:12.150 --> 41:14.118
Very.

41:15.186 --> 41:17.051
You okay?

41:17.088 --> 41:18.248
comfortable?

41:18.289 --> 41:19.278
Just tired is all.

41:20.525 --> 41:22.049
Thanks for coming tonight.

41:22.093 --> 41:23.617
You're welcome.

41:25.763 --> 41:28.254
You know
what my greatest fear was

41:28.366 --> 41:29.993
when l was waiting
for those test results?

41:30.034 --> 41:31.001
What?

41:31.035 --> 41:32.662
Being left alone.

41:32.703 --> 41:34.671
That's a terrible feeling.

41:34.705 --> 41:37.606
l abandoned you.

41:37.642 --> 41:38.666
l'm sorry.

41:38.709 --> 41:39.903
l'll never do it again.

41:41.546 --> 41:42.513
Now, where are your pictures?

41:42.547 --> 41:43.571
l want to look at them again.

41:43.614 --> 41:44.478
l put them away.

41:44.515 --> 41:46.415
Well, l'll get them.

41:46.450 --> 41:48.509
No.

41:48.553 --> 41:50.578
l mean, they're really put away.

41:50.621 --> 41:52.680
Why?

41:52.723 --> 41:54.247
lt's a matter of days.

41:56.093 --> 41:57.958
No, it's not, Jimmy.

41:57.995 --> 41:59.019
You're doing great.

41:59.063 --> 42:02.396
You know how l know?

42:02.433 --> 42:08.235
Because tonight was my swan song
at the Palace of Magic.

42:08.306 --> 42:10.240
And l loved every second.

42:10.341 --> 42:12.502
No regret.

42:12.543 --> 42:13.874
No looking back.

42:15.880 --> 42:17.438
No clinging to memories.

42:22.286 --> 42:26.245
Funny thing is l've never wanted
to cling to memories more.

42:26.290 --> 42:29.521
Now... quit stalling.

42:29.560 --> 42:32.256
l know there's a bad hair
section in here somewhere.

42:33.164 --> 42:35.758
oh, prom night.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.597
Love the clothes.

42:39.637 --> 42:40.661
Pool party.

42:40.705 --> 42:42.195
Good, good.

42:42.240 --> 42:43.229
Nice swimsuits.

42:43.274 --> 42:46.004
Wow, even the girls look good.

42:46.043 --> 42:48.511
What are you doing?

42:48.546 --> 42:50.946
Preserving a memory.

42:50.982 --> 42:53.177
You're gonna be with us
for a long time,

42:53.217 --> 42:54.912
but l want this picture.

43:00.825 --> 43:01.917
A precious one.
