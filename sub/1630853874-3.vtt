00:11.803 --> 00:13.888
<i> For as long</i>
<i>as Devi could remember,</i>

00:13.972 --> 00:17.851
<i>Valentine's Day had been nothing</i>
<i>but a humbling annual reminder</i>

00:17.934 --> 00:20.061
<i>that she was a stone-cold loser.</i>

00:20.145 --> 00:22.522
You will always be my Valentine, <i>kanna.</i>

00:26.484 --> 00:28.486
<i>As far as she was concerned,</i>

00:28.570 --> 00:30.488
<i>this holiday sucked a fat one.</i>

00:35.952 --> 00:39.205
Whoops, sorry, little boy.
I'm supposed to be next door.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.376
<i>But today, Devi had a boyfriend,</i>

00:43.460 --> 00:46.296
<i>and Valentine's Day</i>
<i>was gonna frickin' rule.</i>

00:46.379 --> 00:47.756
-Happy Valentine's Day.
-Hey.

00:47.839 --> 00:50.008
I've got a really romantic date
planned for us tonight.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.093
-Ooh.
-I Febrezed my futon and everything.

00:53.094 --> 00:56.765
<i>Put that in your vape pen</i>
<i>and vape it, loser single girls.</i>

00:57.265 --> 01:00.518
All right. Well, I gotta grab some things
before class, but I'll see you later.

01:00.602 --> 01:01.436
Okay.

01:03.813 --> 01:06.357
-<i>Nothing was gonna ruin today.</i>

01:06.441 --> 01:08.234
-Hey, what's up?
-Yo, what up, dude?

01:08.318 --> 01:12.030
<i>Not even the fear that Devi</i>
<i>may have inadvertently rekindled something</i>

01:12.113 --> 01:14.991
<i>between Paxton and his smoking hot ex.</i>

01:15.075 --> 01:16.910
-Oh, Paxton, wait. Guess what?
-Yep.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.912
You're my perfect match.

01:19.454 --> 01:22.499
What are you talking about?
What is that? Oh!

01:22.582 --> 01:23.458
Happy Valentine's.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.293
Here's your results
from the student council's

01:25.376 --> 01:27.462
compatibility quiz
you took yesterday at lunch.

01:32.759 --> 01:33.676
<i>Oh God.</i>

01:33.760 --> 01:36.721
<i>Maybe there's another Eric Perkins</i>
<i>at this school.</i>

01:40.767 --> 01:42.393
-No way, man.
-Walk much?

01:42.477 --> 01:43.770
What?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.861
Valentine's Day sucks!

01:51.945 --> 01:55.406
I just don't get how I, a person
who's dating the hottest boy in school,

01:55.490 --> 01:57.367
is most compatible with Eric.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.536
Are you more mad that you got Eric,

01:59.619 --> 02:01.371
or that Haley got Paxton?

02:02.455 --> 02:04.332
I'm happy that they're friends again.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.626
I just wish
they weren't such good friends.

02:06.709 --> 02:10.713
You don't have to worry about Haley.
Paxton is super into you.

02:10.797 --> 02:14.509
I know, but he and Haley
have known each other forever,

02:14.592 --> 02:15.718
and they have had sex.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.720
And now I'm picturing them having sex and…

02:17.804 --> 02:20.932
Oh my God, I realized why the computer
said they were a perfect match.

02:21.015 --> 02:22.767
Don't read into it that much.

02:22.851 --> 02:26.479
It's just a dumb quiz made
by dumb teenagers in a dumb school.

02:26.563 --> 02:27.397
Hey, guys.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.108
Hi, Aneesa.

02:31.109 --> 02:34.571
<i> This awkward hello is courtesy</i>
<i>of the following interaction</i>

02:34.654 --> 02:36.114
<i>that has yet to be discussed.</i>

02:40.493 --> 02:43.079
Um, did you just call this quiz dumb?

02:43.163 --> 02:46.249
It was actually developed
by Nobel prize-winning scientists at MIT.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.334
Its accuracy is undisputed.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.211
So, educate yourselves.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.463
Sorry, Jonah.

02:56.342 --> 03:00.180
I can't believe I got Gears Brosnan.
I didn't even know he filled out a quiz.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.390
-Who'd you guys get?
-I got Trent.

03:02.473 --> 03:03.600
Yeah, I got Ben.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.352
Oh wow, Ben. That's so cool

03:06.436 --> 03:09.063
since he's your boyfriend and all.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.150
Hey, Fab, do you feel weird today?

03:12.233 --> 03:14.903
Why? Do I seem weird? Does it seem
like something weird happened?

03:14.986 --> 03:17.906
No, I was just wondering
'cause, you know, it's Valentine's Day,

03:17.989 --> 03:19.157
and you must miss Eve.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.451
Oh. Um…

03:21.534 --> 03:24.537
Yeah, yeah, that's-- I do. I miss her.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.998
Speaking of relationships,

03:27.081 --> 03:30.710
I don't think all the couples here
are gonna make it through Valentine's.

03:30.793 --> 03:31.878
-What?
-Why do you say that?

03:31.961 --> 03:34.005
Because I need to dump Trent.

03:34.088 --> 03:36.090
Wait, I thought things were going well.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.884
I mean, it's been fun.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.385
He's just not very deep.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.970
Like, I'm a second away

03:41.054 --> 03:45.016
from bursting into either song or tears
at every moment of the day.

03:45.099 --> 03:49.270
Shouldn't I be with another artist
or at least another Sagittarius?

03:50.313 --> 03:51.314
Got you, babe.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.440
Oh, hey.

03:52.523 --> 03:53.691
Yeah, I got you too.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.444
Wow,
those MIT guys are good.

03:57.779 --> 03:58.613
I guess.

03:58.696 --> 04:03.201
But doesn't this quiz feel kind of creepy?
Like, real <i>1984 </i>vibes.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.786
The Taylor Swift album?

04:04.869 --> 04:06.663
No, Aneesa.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.289
The book by George Orwell.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.542
God, I've gotta get you
a little library card, huh?

04:13.044 --> 04:15.755
I'd argue that <i>1989</i>
has more literary relevance

04:15.838 --> 04:17.632
than anything George Orwell ever wrote.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.805
Is that true? I only listen to podcasts.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.434
Dr. Vishwakumar,
your next patient is here.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.273
Hi. Rhyah, what brings you in today?

04:33.356 --> 04:35.650
Oh, I just wanted to say hi.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.777
Also, I have this tiny burning rash
going up my arm,

04:37.860 --> 04:39.737
but I mostly just wanted to say hi.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.114
Okay, let me take a look.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.032
-Okay.
-How are things with you?

04:43.116 --> 04:45.535
-I'm good. How are you doing?
-Good. Good, good.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.203
-Itchy?
-Yeah.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.080
-Kind of flaky?
-Little bit.

04:49.163 --> 04:50.665
Mmm. Looks like tinea corporis.

04:50.748 --> 04:53.167
-Oh, what's that?
-It's basically athlete's foot.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.503
Or in this case,
we can call it athlete's forearm.

04:55.586 --> 04:59.215
See, I knew my yoga studio
wasn't washing their mats properly.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.342
I stayed late one time
and watched them flip 'em over.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.511
Don't worry about it.
It's actually fairly common.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.972
I'm just gonna write you a prescription
for anti-fungal cream.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.515
It should clear up in a few weeks.

05:07.598 --> 05:10.435
Fungal infection on Valentine's Day.
Very sexy.

05:10.518 --> 05:11.936
Do you have any plans tonight?

05:12.020 --> 05:15.565
<i>Nalini had completely forgotten</i>
<i>about Valentine's Day.</i>

05:15.648 --> 05:18.318
<i>She had always considered it</i>
<i>a stupid holiday.</i>

05:18.401 --> 05:21.112
<i>But now with Mohan gone,</i>
<i>it felt different.</i>

05:21.195 --> 05:22.071
No.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.199
Mohan, no.

05:26.242 --> 05:29.245
We agreed last year
no Valentine's Day gifts.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.664
This is different. You'll like it.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.001
I spent hardly any money.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.929
You got me a bobblehead of you?

05:47.013 --> 05:48.139
Yeah.

05:48.222 --> 05:51.225
Now you can knock me around
when I'm being hardheaded.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.937
Did you give yourself a stronger jaw?

05:55.688 --> 05:56.689
Well…

05:56.773 --> 05:57.732
Maybe.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.909
Nope.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.453
No Valentine's Day plans

06:10.536 --> 06:13.373
other than tending to the many
demanding people in my household

06:13.456 --> 06:15.249
who drain me of my money and energy.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.418
Well, you should still celebrate.

06:18.169 --> 06:22.340
Hey, you need to carve out
some fun time for you.

06:22.423 --> 06:23.341
Every day.

06:24.425 --> 06:27.470
I already do that for six hours
every night when I'm asleep.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.056
That's not what I mean.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.434
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Let's have a gals hang.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.603
Oh. Uh…

06:36.437 --> 06:37.814
I don't think I can.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.023
Just really busy.

06:39.107 --> 06:39.941
Sorry.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.943
Okay, no worries.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.779
But I'm gonna leave you my number
just in case you change your mind.

06:44.862 --> 06:46.614
-Dr. Vishwakumar.
-Mm-hmm.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.408
Your mother-in-law's on the phone.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.202
She's accidentally locked herself
in the garage again.

06:51.285 --> 06:54.330
She said it's no rush,
but the stove is on.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.460
Good morning, students.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.212
Who knows what this is?

07:01.295 --> 07:03.798
That's a 34C, front clasp, demi-cup.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.802
No, Trent. This is oppression.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.271
Uh, they used to be made
of more flammable materials.

07:18.354 --> 07:19.188
The point is,

07:19.272 --> 07:21.858
we are starting our unit
on the women's rights movement,

07:21.941 --> 07:24.610
and it will take us all the way
till the end of the year.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.905
We're studying the women's rights movement
for the next four months?

07:27.989 --> 07:29.073
What about Watergate?

07:29.157 --> 07:31.492
What about Iran-Contra? What about 9/11?

07:31.576 --> 07:34.287
Uh, would you like to tell
the women in this classroom

07:34.370 --> 07:36.581
that those events mean more to you
than their rights?

07:36.664 --> 07:38.374
We need to know other things
for the AP test.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.709
Reclaiming my time.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.004
The first assignment.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.256
I need all of you to break up into groups

07:45.339 --> 07:48.217
and rewrite the Bill of Rights
as if it were written,

07:48.301 --> 07:49.844
not by Founding Fathers

07:50.720 --> 07:53.139
but instead by Founding Mothers.

07:55.057 --> 07:58.019
Can you believe this?
This is why we need real textbooks.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.812
Well, according to you,
I don't read books.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.314
So I guess I'm cool with it.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.946
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

08:09.030 --> 08:12.283
Yeah, actually.
My superhot boyfriend. Mm-hmm.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.993
And he's a real psycho, so…

08:14.076 --> 08:16.412
-Damn. The cute ones are always taken.
-Mm-hmm.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.540
How's your Valentine's Day going?

08:19.624 --> 08:21.167
It was good at the start,

08:21.250 --> 08:23.711
and then I got Eric
on the compatibility quiz.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.046
Mm. He's not so bad.

08:25.129 --> 08:27.298
He's always the first to notice
when I get a new haircut.

08:27.381 --> 08:28.216
I guess.

08:28.299 --> 08:31.219
I just kind of wanted
to get my smokeshow boyfriend,

08:31.302 --> 08:34.347
but apparently the computer feels
like he's out of my league.

08:34.430 --> 08:37.183
Okay. First of all,
you're my smokeshow girlfriend.

08:37.266 --> 08:39.268
And secondly,

08:39.352 --> 08:42.146
the computer thinks
you're exactly in my league.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.356
<i>Hallelujah.</i>

08:43.856 --> 08:46.484
<i>Who cares if Devi's perfect match was Eric</i>

08:46.567 --> 08:49.320
<i>as long as Paxton's perfect match was her?</i>

08:49.403 --> 08:51.447
<i>According to Nobel scientists</i>,

08:51.531 --> 08:54.575
<i>she was basically the only one</i>
<i>in the whole world for him.</i>

08:54.659 --> 08:56.285
<i>So suck on that, Haley.</i>

08:58.079 --> 09:00.957
Oh, it seems as if it is still flammable.
Everyone out!

09:01.040 --> 09:02.917
Men and teachers last.

09:10.883 --> 09:14.053
Yo, babe.
I have an amazing Valentine's plan.

09:14.762 --> 09:16.931
Picture this, candlelight dinner.

09:17.014 --> 09:19.183
You, me, my Uncle Joe.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.560
Wear something sexy.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.313
Yeah. Um, Trent, I think we should talk.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.565
Oh wow.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.150
Anytime someone says that to me,

09:29.235 --> 09:30.611
it always means great news.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.529
Uh-huh. Yeah.

09:31.612 --> 09:35.074
Well, I don't think I can come
to Valentine's with your Uncle Joe.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.785
Why? Is it because
he hogs the crescent rolls?

09:37.868 --> 09:41.622
Or are you worried he's gonna try
to put you in one of his TV commercials?

09:43.457 --> 09:44.917
One of his, 'scuse me, whats?

09:45.001 --> 09:47.587
His commercials.
He owns a chain of blinds stores.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.006
Chances are you've seen them
while pumping gas.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.676
Wait. Is your Uncle Joe Captain Joe,

09:53.759 --> 09:55.970
the pirate who makes high prices
walk the plank?

09:56.053 --> 09:58.806
That's him. Yeah,
whenever we have dinner together,

09:58.889 --> 10:01.642
he always ropes everyone at the table
into being in his next commercial.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.728
Oh, wow.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.314
But we could always
just go out to a restaurant.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.481
No, I'll be there.

10:08.190 --> 10:12.069
Valentine's Day is about family.
Thanks for reminding me of that.

10:16.532 --> 10:17.366
Hey.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.870
Something wrong?
You kinda bit my head off back there.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.956
Yeah. Well, I didn't love
the way you talked to me earlier.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.459
That little library card remark
was messed up.

10:26.542 --> 10:29.337
Aneesa, I was just teasing.
It was just a joke.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.757
Was it a joke?
You seem genuinely embarrassed by me.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.800
Of course, I'm not embarrassed of you.

10:34.884 --> 10:38.471
You're amazing,
and pretty, and cool, and fun.

10:38.554 --> 10:41.098
So what if you don't know
who some dumb author is.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.267
I don't expect you
to know everything that I know.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.935
There it is. Right there.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.437
You're so condescending.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.772
You know what?

10:47.855 --> 10:50.358
Hmm. Think I'm gonna take
a rain check on Valentine's dinner.

10:50.441 --> 10:51.901
What? Aneesa, wait.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.986
Oh, come on. I didn't mean it like that.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.706
Here we are again
in the old bathroom.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.043
Yeah. Um, Fabiola, about that.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.505
I'm really sorry I kissed you.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.925
Can we just forget about it?

11:16.008 --> 11:17.885
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.388
I'm… I'm still getting over Eve, so…

11:20.888 --> 11:22.431
consider it forgotten.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.517
Thank you.

11:28.896 --> 11:29.730
Good talk.

11:38.906 --> 11:42.326
Whoa! Is that homemade rigatones with…
…mozzarella?

11:42.410 --> 11:45.454
Yep, as long as you count
microwaving a Stouffer's as homemade.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.457
I did cut that sprig of parsley
and put it on there.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.668
Uh, I think that's mint.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.087
Nice, refreshing.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.046
Hmm.

11:56.757 --> 12:00.469
Look at us. You know, at first glance,
we probably seem like a real odd couple.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.431
Because, you know,
you're Paxton Hall-Yoshida.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.100
And I'm just, ugh,
nerdy little me with no abs.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.686
What? Don't talk about yourself like that.

12:08.769 --> 12:11.564
Come on, you're awesome.
You're beautiful. You're smart.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.023
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just saying,

12:13.107 --> 12:16.235
despite that, those MIT scientists
know what they're talking about.

12:16.318 --> 12:20.406
-We're really good together.
-Totes. Just like marinara and mint.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.869
Sure, or things that more classically
go together.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.996
But anyway, we're a good team.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.623
-Yeah, we are a good team.
-Mm-hmm.

12:29.707 --> 12:30.708
Hey, speaking of teams,

12:30.791 --> 12:33.377
I'm gonna play paintball tomorrow
with a bunch of dudes. Wanna come?

12:33.461 --> 12:35.129
I absolutely do not.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.548
But yet again,
I love that we like different things,

12:37.631 --> 12:39.842
because per the computer,
opposites attract.

12:39.925 --> 12:40.968
They sure do.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.721
Happy Valentine's Day, Devi.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.017
Oh, shit.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.644
I totally forgot.
I bought fancy Parm for this.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.230
Not even the green can.
It's like a little brick I have to grate.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.232
So, BRB.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.027
<i>Devi was finally at peace</i>
<i>in her relationship.</i>

12:58.110 --> 12:59.820
<i>And though the bar was low,</i>

12:59.904 --> 13:02.573
<i>she was having</i>
<i>the most romantic meal of her life.</i>

13:02.656 --> 13:05.034
<i>All she had to do now was lean back</i>

13:05.117 --> 13:07.703
<i>and wait for her chiseled,</i>
<i>doting boyfriend</i>

13:07.787 --> 13:10.331
<i>to bring her freshly grated cheese and…</i>

13:11.415 --> 13:13.834
<i>lie to her frickin' face.</i>

13:13.918 --> 13:16.003
<i>-What the hell?</i>

13:16.086 --> 13:20.090
Cheers to my most romantic
Valentine's Day dinner yet.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.885
-Eye contact.
-Mmm. Sure.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.596
Eye contact. Eleanor, eye contact.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.014
Yep.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.645
So, Captain Joe.

13:32.728 --> 13:34.230
You know, I'm a big fan.

13:34.313 --> 13:38.609
I love the commercial
where you slash prices and some blinds

13:38.692 --> 13:40.027
with your hook hand.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.404
Thanks. Actually, I didn't mean
to rip those blinds in half,

13:42.488 --> 13:44.406
but we forgot to roll sound
on the other take, so…

13:44.490 --> 13:46.742
The performances are phenomenal.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.536
Where do you find the actors?

13:48.619 --> 13:50.955
Mmm… Mostly family dinners.

13:51.038 --> 13:53.666
Oh, hey, you know, Eleanor is an actor.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.417
-A really good one.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.712
Well, if you want,
you can play a salty sea wench.

13:59.547 --> 14:00.840
In your next commercial?

14:01.549 --> 14:02.424
Yeah, sure.

14:04.885 --> 14:05.886
Oh my God.

14:07.429 --> 14:08.681
I'm a working actor.

14:09.306 --> 14:12.226
I'm a working actor. Thank you so much.

14:12.309 --> 14:15.187
Yeah, anything for someone
who makes my nephew here so happy.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.315
Oh, not even weed makes me this happy.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.032
Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart.

14:37.042 --> 14:40.087
Oh, Devi. Hi. Hey, do you want
to have a little bit of dinner with me?

14:40.170 --> 14:42.756
Your grandmother's having Galentine's
with one of her cliques,

14:42.840 --> 14:45.843
and believe I saw your cousin sneak
into your teacher's crappy little Honda.

14:45.926 --> 14:48.512
Uh, no, thanks. I already ate.
I'm just gonna go up to my room.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.348
Uh, I have a big test tomorrow.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.310
<i> As Nalini envisioned her night</i>

14:54.393 --> 14:57.897
<i>watching a Hallmark movie</i>
<i>with an inanimate object,</i>

14:57.980 --> 15:00.482
<i>she started to entertain the possibility</i>

15:00.566 --> 15:03.611
<i>that she might need</i>
<i>to broaden her social horizons.</i>

15:04.612 --> 15:06.614
<i>Hi, Rhyah! Still free tomorrow?</i>

15:07.197 --> 15:08.908
<i>This is Nalini Vishwakumar.</i>

15:08.991 --> 15:11.660
<i>Devi hadn't mentioned the card</i>
<i>to Paxton,</i>

15:11.744 --> 15:15.080
<i>instead she had spent</i>
<i>the rest of dinner pretending to be happy,</i>

15:15.164 --> 15:18.334
<i>like I did when I got runner-up</i>
<i>at Wimbledon in 1980.</i>

15:18.417 --> 15:20.711
<i>Not doing a great job there, bud.</i>

15:20.794 --> 15:23.589
Wow, you really weren't lying

15:23.672 --> 15:24.882
about the Parmesan.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.425
-It's delicious.
-I know, right?

15:26.508 --> 15:27.718
Yeah. Uh-huh.

15:28.385 --> 15:31.805
I sure can trust you
when it comes to cheese.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.065
<i>But obviously</i>
<i>Devi was spiraling.</i>

15:41.565 --> 15:43.484
<i>Why did Paxton lie to her?</i>

15:43.567 --> 15:44.735
<i>And, more importantly,</i>

15:44.818 --> 15:47.571
<i>was his perfect match</i>
<i>who she thought it was?</i>

15:53.869 --> 15:57.081
Eric, we need to talk about
the compatibility quiz. I know you got me.

15:57.164 --> 16:01.460
Shh! Keep it down.
You trying to ruin my rep, dork?

16:01.543 --> 16:03.045
Excuse me, nerd?

16:04.129 --> 16:08.050
I've spent the last two years
trying to date someone who's hot

16:08.133 --> 16:09.426
and become popular,

16:09.510 --> 16:12.805
so that I'm not just the kid
who lost his dad…

16:12.888 --> 16:15.474
<i> Damn. Maybe they were alike.</i>

16:15.557 --> 16:16.600
…at Disneyland.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.727
I had to wait for him
near the security desk.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.853
Oh my God.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.814
<i>Ugh. This kid.</i>

16:21.897 --> 16:25.567
Well, I know Paxton made you trade cards
with him. So tell me who he got.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.446
-Hmm. Interesting. What's it worth to ya?
-Just give me the card, Eric.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.782
Oh, you mean this card?

16:32.449 --> 16:36.286
Well, it is gonna cost you big time.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.247
Haley.

16:38.789 --> 16:39.623
Damn it.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.668
No, I don't. No! I never said that.

16:42.751 --> 16:45.421
-Is she laughing? That's five bucks then.
-I'm not laughing.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.260
How'd the rest of your Valentine's go?
Did you break up with--

16:51.343 --> 16:53.137
Ah! My boyfriend.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.808
I'm gonna take that as a no.

16:58.392 --> 17:02.938
No, I didn't break up with him.
Instead, I used him to get to his uncle.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.149
I'm gonna need you to elaborate on that.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.443
His uncle's Captain Joe.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.694
The blinds guy?

17:08.777 --> 17:11.780
Yep, and I weaseled my way
into one of his commercials.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.700
Oh my God, Eleanor,
you're gonna be in a commercial?

17:14.783 --> 17:16.910
Yeah, but I feel really gross about it.

17:17.661 --> 17:18.704
So what are you gonna do?

17:18.787 --> 17:22.207
I think I have
to let both Trent and the commercial go.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.545
Maybe one of these days
I'll meet someone who's right for me,

17:26.628 --> 17:28.756
whose uncle also makes commercials.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.970
And so Eric shows me Paxton's card,
and it's frigging Haley.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.599
Are you worried that something
is going on between them?

17:39.183 --> 17:40.309
I don't know.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.518
I don't think so.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.104
It's just… Why else would he lie?

17:45.105 --> 17:48.025
Well, it was wrong for Paxton
to be dishonest.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.069
But why do you care so much
about this test?

17:50.152 --> 17:50.986
It's just…

17:53.030 --> 17:56.366
when I see him talking to Haley,
I feel really jealous.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.994
They look so good together.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.414
Like, no one would bat an eye
if you said that they were a couple.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.667
And you think you and Paxton
are getting tons of eye bats?

18:05.751 --> 18:08.504
I can't help but worry
that this is some weird phase for him

18:08.587 --> 18:10.964
where he dates a quirky, smart girl.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.008
And at any moment, he's gonna be like,

18:13.092 --> 18:15.177
"Yo, you know what I miss?"

18:15.260 --> 18:19.556
"Superhot models with six-pack abs
and, like, symmetrical boobs."

18:20.933 --> 18:24.394
First of all, girl,
nobody has symmetrical boobs.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.647
Everybody's got a Biggie and a Smalls.

18:26.730 --> 18:30.526
And secondly, that way of thinking
is selling you both short.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.653
-Like, look at this girl.
-Do I have to?

18:32.736 --> 18:34.571
Yes. Look at her stories.

18:35.155 --> 18:38.200
Here she is doing
a cool dance, ironically.

18:38.283 --> 18:41.370
And here she is doing Pilates.
Probably without even queefing.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.832
-And here she is playing paintball.

18:45.791 --> 18:49.211
Wait, she's playing paintball?
Doc, I gotta go.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.380
Devi, don't. Let's work through this.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.132
Devi, don't go--

18:54.967 --> 18:55.884
Shit.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.804
Mmm, an açaí bowl.
I never had one of these before.

18:58.887 --> 18:59.930
-Really?
-Mm-mm.

19:00.013 --> 19:01.598
Oh, açaí bowls are great.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.893
They're loaded with antioxidants, fiber.
They boost brain function.

19:05.519 --> 19:08.772
But really, they're just a way to eat tons
of sugar and pretend it's healthy for you.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.110
You sound like my husband.
He had a huge sweet tooth.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.778
One time he had three Pizookies.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.613
That's a cookie the size of a pie.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.407
Got very sick to the stomach.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.661
But even in severe abdominal pain,
he was still able to make me laugh.

19:23.954 --> 19:26.498
I'm sorry, Nalini.
Must be really difficult without him.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.210
Yesterday was harder
than I expected, you know.

19:31.044 --> 19:34.047
I always thought Valentine's Day
was stupid, but last night…

19:35.090 --> 19:37.426
…I would've given anything for him
to walk through the door

19:37.509 --> 19:39.469
with a $5 teddy bear from the gas station.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.305
I wish you could've had that too.

19:43.056 --> 19:46.476
Saw a picture of him in your office.
Good for you, girl.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.190
-He was nice to look at, wasn't he?
-Mmm.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.775
But that's not what I miss most about him.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.862
I truly just miss having
my best friend around.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.490
Well, it sounds like a new friend
is just what's needed.

20:03.410 --> 20:06.205
Let's do something fun.
Have you ever had a blowout?

20:06.288 --> 20:08.540
I fear this açaí bowl may lead to one.

20:10.876 --> 20:14.630
No. No, no. I meant your hair.
There's a blow-dry bar over there.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.757
-No, please.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.551
-I'm so embarrassed.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.594
Sounds like fun.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.475
What up? Let's get our P-ball on.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.852
Hey, I didn't think you wanted to play.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.103
I changed my mind.

20:30.729 --> 20:31.730
As I always say,

20:31.813 --> 20:33.982
a couple that shoots guns together
has funs together--

20:34.066 --> 20:35.067
-Ah!

20:35.150 --> 20:37.736
Wow, that is a sensitive trigger.

20:37.819 --> 20:38.654
Dope.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.823
Well, we already picked teams,
but Trent's team is down a person.

20:43.325 --> 20:46.495
Oh. Yeah. Sure. I'll be on Trent's team.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.455
All right, cool. Let's go!

20:50.374 --> 20:52.709
Welcome to the squad, Crazy Devi.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.921
Okay, I've given it some thought,
and here's our strategy.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.507
If you see someone on the other team,
shoot paintballs at them,

20:58.590 --> 21:00.467
and then the second part
of that strategy is

21:00.550 --> 21:03.470
don't let them shoot paintballs
that hit you.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.348
Oh, and be careful
'cause Haley's a sick shot.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.308
How good could she be?

21:11.561 --> 21:14.273
-Jesus.
-Yeah, she and Paxton are gonna smoke us.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.775
Oh, which reminds me.
I'm gonna get high before we do this.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.652
<i>As Devi looked over</i>

21:18.735 --> 21:21.989
<i>at the so-called perfect match</i>
<i>of Haley and Paxton,</i>

21:22.072 --> 21:26.535
<i>she realized she had let this dumb</i>
<i>compatibility test mess with her head,</i>

21:26.618 --> 21:30.247
<i>and the only way to go forward</i>
<i>was to let the test go.</i>

21:30.330 --> 21:34.084
<i>But also, she decided the only way</i>
<i>she could let the test go</i>

21:34.167 --> 21:36.795
<i>is if she kicked Haley's ass at paintball</i>

21:36.878 --> 21:39.840
<i>proving that she was</i>
<i>Paxton's true perfect match.</i>

21:40.340 --> 21:43.343
<i>What? You thought</i>
<i>she was gonna be mature about this?</i>

21:53.478 --> 21:56.648
Wow. Am I amazing at this?

22:01.153 --> 22:02.529
-Ow.

22:11.705 --> 22:14.624
Oh, I bruise so easily.

22:36.855 --> 22:40.108
-On your knees.
-What?

22:42.444 --> 22:44.029
Bet you thought you could beat me, huh?

22:44.613 --> 22:47.240
I might not be as cute as you
or as limber as you,

22:47.324 --> 22:49.451
and my hair might not be
as shiny as yours,

22:49.534 --> 22:52.412
but I do have determination and grit

22:52.496 --> 22:54.456
like the noble cockroach.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.208
I don't know what's happening.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.877
But could you shoot me so I can be out
of the game and get a soda?

22:58.960 --> 23:01.797
Okay, I'm gonna shoot you
when I'm good and ready to--

23:03.965 --> 23:07.135
-Yes! Blue team wins. Let's go!
-Whoo!

23:07.219 --> 23:09.429
-Whoo!

23:09.513 --> 23:10.347
Yeah!

23:14.601 --> 23:16.937
Aneesa. Neese, wait.
You have to talk to me.

23:17.020 --> 23:21.024
I know that I messed up,
and I was a dick. I'm really sorry.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.819
Yeah, I don't think this is working out.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.239
What? No. Why?

23:27.322 --> 23:29.157
I don't think you respect me.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.701
And you make me feel stupid,

23:31.785 --> 23:33.245
and I'm not stupid.

23:34.204 --> 23:37.207
I deserve someone who's excited
to be with me just as I am

23:38.834 --> 23:40.794
and who doesn't wish I was someone else.

23:49.594 --> 23:52.264
Shit. Why are you in every room I enter?

23:52.973 --> 23:56.143
I don't know the answer to that.
Um, I can go, though.

23:59.479 --> 24:01.940
-Wait. Are you okay?

24:07.237 --> 24:08.488
Ben and I just broke up.

24:09.156 --> 24:09.990
Oh.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.118
I-- I'm really sorry, Aneesa.

24:13.201 --> 24:17.205
It was for the best.
He wasn't really right for me.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.875
So I guess the test was wrong for you.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.210
No. No.
I lied about getting Ben.

24:24.171 --> 24:27.257
-I actually got a random freshman.

24:29.259 --> 24:33.555
Listen, I am sure
you will find another great guy soon.

24:36.725 --> 24:41.688
Or, you know, a great girl
if kissing me wasn't a fluke.

24:42.856 --> 24:46.151
I'm sure the right person is out there.

24:47.152 --> 24:50.113
<i>Even though the conversation</i>
<i>had some mixed signals,</i>

24:50.197 --> 24:52.741
<i>Fabiola felt good about it.</i>
<i>It was a start.</i>

24:52.824 --> 24:56.328
Well, in the meantime,
I'm here if you want to talk.

24:57.787 --> 24:58.747
Thanks, Fabiola.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.042
You're a good friend.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.176
Watch it, dude.

25:19.309 --> 25:20.352
Nice job, Haley.

25:20.435 --> 25:21.770
I can't believe you shot me.

25:21.853 --> 25:24.814
You saw Haley and I sitting there,
and you shot me, and I'm your girlfriend.

25:24.898 --> 25:25.982
She was on my team.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.442
And I thought we were a team.

25:28.109 --> 25:30.654
-What is going on with you?
-I know you lied.

25:30.737 --> 25:33.615
I know you got Haley on the test,
and you lied to me. Why?

25:34.533 --> 25:35.575
I don't know. Maybe because

25:35.659 --> 25:37.869
I thought you might take it badly
if you knew I got Haley.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.371
Why would you think that?

25:39.454 --> 25:41.957
Well, because of how you're acting
right now.

25:42.040 --> 25:46.044
And also you've been really weird
since Haley and I became friends again,

25:46.127 --> 25:48.380
even though you're the one
who made me apologize.

25:48.463 --> 25:51.466
Sorry, but she's so beautiful
and good with guns,

25:51.550 --> 25:55.220
and could be Lara Croft for Halloween.
How am I supposed to compete with that?

25:55.303 --> 25:56.388
You don't.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.848
Haley and I are just friends.
I'm with you.

25:58.932 --> 26:02.686
I know, but I don't understand why.

26:02.769 --> 26:03.645
Why what?

26:04.145 --> 26:06.940
Why I'm with you? Because I like you.

26:07.023 --> 26:11.486
Yeah, but why?
No one else thinks we make any sense.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.573
No, <i>you </i>don't think we make any sense.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.950
Because when we walk
down the halls,

26:17.033 --> 26:18.743
I know what everyone's thinking.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.413
"Oh, why is he with her?
He's too good for her."

26:21.496 --> 26:23.999
Who cares what people think?

26:24.082 --> 26:26.084
I think you're good enough for me.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.587
But I can't keep trying
to convince you of that.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.339
What does that mean?

26:31.840 --> 26:34.426
Look, Devi, I-I really like you, but…

26:36.261 --> 26:38.638
I-I don't think
we can have a real relationship

26:38.722 --> 26:40.223
until you like yourself.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.185
I'm sorry.

26:59.367 --> 27:00.368
Whoa, Eleanor!

27:01.786 --> 27:03.830
Are you here to play paintball too?

27:03.913 --> 27:06.291
Weird. I wouldn't have pegged that
as one of your interests.

27:06.374 --> 27:08.918
It's not, Trent. I wanted to talk to you.

27:09.002 --> 27:11.796
-Well, then it's good I was here also.
-Uh-huh.

27:11.880 --> 27:15.175
Let me just dive in. There's something
I have to confess to you.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.637
I used you
to get into your uncle's commercial.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.473
I was gonna break up with you,
and then you told me about it,

27:21.556 --> 27:25.769
and I deployed my incredible acting skills
to manipulate you.

27:26.269 --> 27:30.190
But I won't take the commercial,
and you'll never have to see me again.

27:30.273 --> 27:31.900
We have a lot of classes together.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.320
Okay, well, yeah, you'll see me in those.

27:35.403 --> 27:37.405
But I can wear my veil if that would help.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.282
Eleanor, I knew you were gonna dump me.

27:39.866 --> 27:41.117
I'm not a great boyfriend.

27:41.201 --> 27:44.329
I've been told by many guidance counselors
that I'm clinically immature.

27:45.747 --> 27:48.750
-I actually manipulated you.
-What?

27:48.833 --> 27:50.502
I dangled Uncle Joe in front of you

27:50.585 --> 27:53.755
like a carrot in front of a person
who really likes carrots.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.466
I knew his Hollywood connections
would make you stay with me.

27:56.549 --> 28:00.679
Wait, so we deceived each other
to get what we wanted?

28:02.055 --> 28:04.516
Oh my God.
We're like a real celebrity couple.

28:07.977 --> 28:09.646
I really like you, Eleanor.

28:10.313 --> 28:13.775
I know it seems like I'm knee-deep
in tang twenty-four-sevskies, but…

28:14.984 --> 28:18.446
you're actually my first girlfriend,
and I'm a little insecure about that.

28:27.747 --> 28:29.249
Devi. Guess what?

28:29.332 --> 28:31.292
I did a gal pal hang today.

28:31.376 --> 28:34.713
Please check out my blowout.
I look like a newswoman.

28:36.005 --> 28:37.257
Yeah. That… That's great, Mom.

28:37.340 --> 28:38.550
Is everything okay?

28:38.633 --> 28:42.846
Y-Yeah. Um, I just didn't do well
on that test I told you about earlier.

28:46.850 --> 28:47.684
Devi.

28:49.185 --> 28:50.729
What actually happened?

28:50.812 --> 28:52.480
Is this about a boy?

28:52.564 --> 28:55.483
Even though I won't let you date,
I do care if you're heartbroken.

28:57.193 --> 28:59.821
Yeah. It's about a boy.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.449
And I really, really liked him.

29:06.828 --> 29:07.829
Come here.
