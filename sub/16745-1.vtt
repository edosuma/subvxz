01:17.644 --> 01:20.647
<i>We're all in Milan,</i>
<i>just waiting for you, Editor!</i>

01:20.780 --> 01:22.482
Okay, I know.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.766
<i>One, two, three.</i>

01:40.099 --> 01:42.235
Cheese!

01:43.536 --> 01:44.604
Merry Christmas!

01:44.737 --> 01:46.606
Thank you for the Christmas dinner.

01:49.142 --> 01:50.643
"Merry Christmas!

01:50.777 --> 01:55.181
Let's have dinner when you're free."

01:55.548 --> 01:57.517
Who's this from?

01:57.817 --> 02:00.220
You should ask me
before you look at my phone.

02:00.420 --> 02:03.156
<i>We're best friends.</i>
<i>There are no secrets between us.</i>

02:22.342 --> 02:25.512
As a young reporter
covering soccer for five years...

02:25.645 --> 02:29.149
...I finally watched
the Lega Serie A yesterday.

02:29.282 --> 02:31.551
I'd rather try my luck
while I'm still young...

02:31.684 --> 02:35.155
...instead of having a job
with no prospects.

02:35.288 --> 02:37.223
Maybe I will succeed.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.592
I never thought that you
would have such ambition.

02:40.226 --> 02:42.395
Why are you so mean?

02:42.829 --> 02:45.198
It's harmless goading.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.568
You know I take it to heart.

02:49.335 --> 02:52.272
Here, I vow to God:

02:52.772 --> 02:57.377
One day, I will become
a world-famous reporter!

02:57.777 --> 02:58.778
<i>How do you feel right now?</i>

02:59.679 --> 03:02.715
<i>What can I say? It's unbelievable.</i>

03:03.249 --> 03:04.684
<i>An unbelievable night. Thank you</i>

03:25.305 --> 03:29.409
I am going to chase after my dreams,
just like you do! --Lin Ran

03:40.320 --> 03:41.387
What is it now?

03:41.521 --> 03:44.357
<i>Editor, have you arrived</i>
<i>at the airport?</i>

03:44.490 --> 03:45.625
On my way.

03:45.758 --> 03:49.395
<i>Still on your way?</i>
<i>You'll miss your flight!</i>

03:49.529 --> 03:52.432
Ma Li, this is not
my first Fashion Week.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.268
<i>But this is your first time there</i>
<i>as editor-in-chief.</i>

03:55.401 --> 03:57.370
<i>Do you know how busy</i>
<i>your schedule is?</i>

03:57.503 --> 03:59.505
<i>I've been prepping in Italy</i>
<i>for so many days.</i>

03:59.639 --> 04:00.974
<i>Please don't miss--</i>

04:45.518 --> 04:47.954
Editor, we have
a fully packed schedule this week.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.656
Time is tight.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.891
Today you've got 13 events.

04:52.025 --> 04:55.728
In addition to the fashion shows,
you also have other meetings.

04:55.862 --> 04:58.064
You can do it!

05:02.635 --> 05:05.338
-Send me the schedule through WeChat.
-Okay.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.850
Editor, what's on your mind?

05:18.651 --> 05:20.586
I missed a call.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.854
Whose call?

05:21.988 --> 05:23.089
Don't know.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.358
Telemarketer, maybe.

05:26.559 --> 05:29.996
A U.K. number, possibly Lin Ran.

05:30.530 --> 05:31.898
Lin Ran?

05:32.565 --> 05:34.600
Oh, the quasi-boyfriend!

05:34.901 --> 05:36.836
Quasi-what?

05:36.969 --> 05:39.405
An unexpected phone call.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.841
Maybe it's a confession of love?

05:42.542 --> 05:47.480
Double-check the venue details.

05:48.414 --> 05:51.984
Editor, what about making him
your official boyfriend?

05:52.118 --> 05:53.953
Men and women are different.

05:54.087 --> 05:57.690
Women have fewer options
as they get older.

06:02.495 --> 06:06.599
<i>Editor, you've been to Milan</i>
<i>with Lin Ran, right?</i>

06:31.858 --> 06:35.928
Wow, we're finally here
at the Lega Serie A!

06:42.401 --> 06:46.606
I told you we wouldn't get in
without a ticket.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.442
At least we were close to getting in.

06:51.177 --> 06:53.412
You always say that.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.469
Good morning!

07:16.736 --> 07:18.571
It's a pleasure to see you again.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.050
Hello, welcome to the Bulgari Hotel.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.518
Hello.

07:39.826 --> 07:43.463
These are the photos
of the event venue.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.465
Villa Litta, again.

07:45.898 --> 07:47.099
Okay.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.203
Should we add some more decoration?

07:50.536 --> 07:52.939
Maybe some flowers?

07:53.072 --> 07:56.709
My head is killing me.
I can't think about these things now.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.780
Hey, champagne!

08:01.247 --> 08:03.249
Let's have a drink.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.952
Editor, we don't have time.

08:06.085 --> 08:09.522
We need to get going
or we'll be late.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.693
Well, I should have time
to get changed.

08:49.629 --> 08:50.863
Calm down.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.835
Editor, a call.

08:57.770 --> 08:58.838
Hello?

08:59.305 --> 09:01.908
<i>Editor-in-Chief,</i>
<i>is your phone working at all?</i>

09:02.108 --> 09:03.643
Lin Ran!

09:04.710 --> 09:07.547
Wow, it's been a long time.
Where have you been?

09:07.680 --> 09:10.249
<i>Editor-in-Chief,</i>
<i>I saw in the news you arrived in Milan.</i>

09:10.583 --> 09:12.718
<i>I have something important to tell you.</i>
<i>It's important.</i>

09:12.852 --> 09:16.889
Don't tell me you want to leave
your job at the BBC...

09:17.023 --> 09:19.959
...to travel the world again.

09:20.092 --> 09:22.328
<i>I'm getting married!</i>

09:24.797 --> 09:25.898
What did you say?

09:26.032 --> 09:27.633
<i>I'm getting married!</i>

09:27.767 --> 09:29.735
<i>Yes, the wedding is this weekend.</i>

09:29.869 --> 09:32.038
<i>If you have time,</i>
<i>you should come to London.</i>

09:32.171 --> 09:33.639
Getting married....

09:33.773 --> 09:36.108
<i>She's innocent and wonderful.</i>

09:36.242 --> 09:37.276
<i>Her name is Meng Yixuan.</i>

09:37.810 --> 09:40.112
<i>I understand that you're busy,</i>
<i>but we grew up together.</i>

09:40.246 --> 09:42.114
<i>I'm sorry I left last time</i>
<i>without saying goodbye.</i>

09:42.582 --> 09:43.583
<i>Here's the plan:</i>

09:43.716 --> 09:45.685
<i>I will take care of your flight and hotel.</i>

09:45.818 --> 09:46.886
<i>You have to come!</i>

09:50.590 --> 09:51.857
Editor.

09:51.991 --> 09:55.027
Editor, your boarding pass.

09:56.696 --> 09:59.599
Editor, are you really leaving?

09:59.732 --> 10:01.601
What am I supposed to do without you?

10:01.734 --> 10:05.071
I can't handle it alone, Editor.

10:56.722 --> 10:58.124
So what now?

10:59.925 --> 11:04.163
You suddenly call and tell me
that you're getting married?

11:04.296 --> 11:07.667
So growing up together
means nothing to you?

11:09.101 --> 11:12.405
Is this how you treat
your best friend?

11:12.972 --> 11:14.340
Just notifying me like that?

11:14.673 --> 11:16.342
Did you ever ask if I approve?

12:28.414 --> 12:29.482
Hey.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.887
Try reading
if you feel so restless.

12:35.955 --> 12:38.057
-You speak Chinese?
-Yep.

12:38.190 --> 12:40.126
Your English is not bad.

12:43.529 --> 12:47.900
Tell me if I have done
anything wrong.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.770
Why would he marry another girl?

12:53.372 --> 12:57.143
Try this.
It may ease your nerves.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.344
Here. Try it.

13:19.265 --> 13:20.933
That was fast!

13:21.433 --> 13:23.536
Now can you answer
my question?

13:23.969 --> 13:27.139
People say that women with high IQs
are usually left on the shelf.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.509
How could you say that to me?!

13:38.117 --> 13:40.986
I really didn't mean it.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.223
I just can't control my emotions.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.224
My gosh.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.139
-Tu Tu!
-Lin Ran!

14:34.273 --> 14:35.374
Come on!

14:39.545 --> 14:41.313
It's been forever.
I miss you so much.

14:41.447 --> 14:42.648
-Miss me?
-Yep.

14:42.982 --> 14:43.983
Awesome.

14:50.923 --> 14:52.925
Let me introduce you.
Come on.

14:54.994 --> 14:58.564
Here. This is my fiancée,
Xuan Xuan.

14:59.131 --> 15:01.433
This is my best friend,
Gu Tu Tu.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.668
Stop calling me that.

15:03.302 --> 15:06.538
I know I should call you Ms. Gu.
Delighted to meet you.

15:06.672 --> 15:08.274
You can just call me Gu Jia.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.408
Okay, totally.

15:09.642 --> 15:10.910
Gu Jia.

15:11.543 --> 15:14.079
Hey, where is your luggage?

15:14.346 --> 15:16.015
I came in such a hurry,
I forgot to bring it.

15:16.515 --> 15:19.385
-You are such a good friend.
-No wonder.

15:19.518 --> 15:22.254
Don't worry. You can try on
some of my outfits tomorrow.

15:22.388 --> 15:24.924
As long as you don't mind
looking kind of girly.

15:25.524 --> 15:28.694
She's an editor-in-chief
in the fashion industry.

15:29.028 --> 15:31.196
She won't have a problem
getting pretty dresses.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.999
Right. I can get any outfit
with just a phone call.

15:35.167 --> 15:39.438
How about we go to my house first,
then drive you to the hotel tonight?

15:39.571 --> 15:40.572
Shall we?

15:40.706 --> 15:42.274
Can I say no?

15:42.708 --> 15:43.709
Of course...

15:44.043 --> 15:45.077
...not.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.247
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

15:50.649 --> 15:52.618
What do you think of my fiancée?

15:53.152 --> 15:57.456
She's, like, totally young,
totally pretty and, like, totally cute.

15:57.690 --> 16:01.126
That's how all Post-'90s talk.
Totally this, totally that.

16:01.260 --> 16:04.430
-Why are you talking like that?
-Who says it's only for the Post-'90s?

16:04.563 --> 16:05.965
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

16:06.098 --> 16:07.366
I am totally pretty.

16:07.499 --> 16:09.268
-What's wrong?
-Xuan Xuan, we're coming.

16:10.402 --> 16:13.372
Let's open the convertible roof
for Gu Jia.

16:13.505 --> 16:14.606
Yeah, sure.

16:15.274 --> 16:16.608
We'll go to the car first.

16:19.011 --> 16:21.647
Look at you.
Driving a convertible.

16:23.615 --> 16:24.650
Sit tight.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.285
Is this car yours?

16:28.053 --> 16:29.521
Of course!

16:30.055 --> 16:32.491
A fancy car for an editor-in-chief.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.479
Gu Jia, how do you like the car?

16:53.612 --> 16:57.182
Lin Ran bought it
after he got promoted at the BBC.

16:57.383 --> 16:58.650
Awesome.

17:00.285 --> 17:02.154
Isn't my friend pretty?

17:02.454 --> 17:04.423
Of course.
She's gorgeous.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.026
Thanks.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.595
You think just because
you look so fancy now...

17:09.728 --> 17:12.631
...I've forgotten how cheap
you were back then.

17:13.132 --> 17:15.367
I might have been poor,
but I was never cheap.

17:15.501 --> 17:18.504
Did I ever blink an eye
when I bought you three hamburgers?

17:18.637 --> 17:22.374
Yeah, but on our trip, who made us
share a hotel room to save money?

17:22.508 --> 17:23.675
Oh, count your blessings.

17:23.809 --> 17:26.745
You slept in the bed,
and I slept on the floor.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.782
Had our trip lasted longer,
I would've had to pawn all my belongings.

17:30.783 --> 17:31.784
You know...

17:32.117 --> 17:36.055
...Gu Jia believes that I should always
be the one who takes care of the bills.

17:36.188 --> 17:37.756
That's not true.

17:38.090 --> 17:41.693
You know, the BBC is promoting him
to be a producer in America.

17:42.261 --> 17:45.197
Lin Ran is really outstanding.
There's nothing he can't do.

17:45.330 --> 17:48.067
That's enough.
She knows how great I am.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.536
Stop bragging,
or I will have no room to improve.

17:50.669 --> 17:51.837
But you are great

17:55.707 --> 17:58.243
Enough. I feel like throwing up.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.146
I'll get even better in the future.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.248
Great.

18:03.615 --> 18:05.451
Do you believe me?

18:27.239 --> 18:29.374
-Your house?
-Yeah.

18:30.309 --> 18:31.610
Finally.

18:32.144 --> 18:33.645
Help me out of the car.

18:34.179 --> 18:36.148
You are always in a hurry.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.684
-I want to see your new house!
-Lame reason.

18:40.352 --> 18:42.754
Small door for such a big house.

18:46.758 --> 18:48.427
So classy.

18:49.161 --> 18:52.264
I thought your home would be
splendid and magnificent.

18:52.397 --> 18:56.368
Turns out, it is quite elegant.

18:57.302 --> 19:00.706
Gu Jia, come with me.

19:05.177 --> 19:06.245
Hey, hold on.

19:06.378 --> 19:09.481
This is the ladies' fitting room.
Get out of here.

19:09.615 --> 19:11.216
Xuan Xuan.

19:14.453 --> 19:15.654
Gu Jia...

19:16.421 --> 19:20.893
...you look even prettier in person
than in the photos he showed me.

19:21.226 --> 19:22.794
You are so young and talented.

19:22.928 --> 19:26.498
I would have fallen in love with you
if I were him.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.567
I think so, too.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.437
But he is right.
You're too good for him.

19:32.638 --> 19:33.839
Did he say that?

19:35.607 --> 19:37.309
Look.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.878
What do you think of this?
Is it nice?

19:40.212 --> 19:42.514
It's nice. Is it for the groom?

19:42.948 --> 19:45.484
No, it's for the best man.

19:45.617 --> 19:47.519
It's made for you.

19:47.653 --> 19:50.355
Me? Best man?

19:50.556 --> 19:53.926
You'd better get a guy
to be the best man. Why me?

19:54.660 --> 19:56.495
Gu Jia.

19:57.896 --> 20:02.501
Lin Ran always said
that you were like his sibling...

20:02.634 --> 20:07.539
...his only family
after his parents were gone.

20:07.839 --> 20:10.776
I want to surprise him.

20:10.909 --> 20:13.212
Can you please be his best man?

20:13.345 --> 20:14.413
No way.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.816
-I know you will change your mind.
-No.

20:17.950 --> 20:21.954
Please. I'm begging you, Gu Jia.
You're so nice and charming.

20:22.287 --> 20:24.456
I'm begging you.
Please try it on.

20:24.590 --> 20:25.691
I'll be back.

20:25.824 --> 20:28.794
Try it on. Try it on!

20:30.829 --> 20:32.397
Best man?

20:32.798 --> 20:35.300
I came here to be the bride!

20:38.337 --> 20:40.606
This should be my dress.

21:17.643 --> 21:21.013
Are you ready?
Can I come in?

21:26.652 --> 21:28.353
Why are you wearing the veil?

21:31.423 --> 21:33.692
Thanks, Gu Jia,
for trying on the veil.

21:35.661 --> 21:37.396
It's very nice and beautiful.

21:37.529 --> 21:38.764
Is there something wrong
with the veil?

21:39.364 --> 21:42.000
No, I just wanted to see
how I should put it on.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.003
That's right.

21:45.337 --> 21:48.040
Hello, I'm Gu Jia.
Lin Ran's friend.

21:48.373 --> 21:50.509
-Welcome!
-So you're Gu Jia. Welcome!

21:50.642 --> 21:51.710
Let me show you around.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.512
Please make yourself at home.

21:56.515 --> 21:59.518
So Lin Ran invited
his very best friend.

21:59.651 --> 22:02.654
Who knew that Lin Ran's friend
was so pretty.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.556
Xuan Xuan,
you'd better be careful.

22:04.690 --> 22:08.493
Dad, Gu Jia is pretty,
but what about me?

22:08.627 --> 22:10.796
You are my daughter.
Of course you are pretty!

22:10.929 --> 22:11.930
Did you give birth to her?

22:12.397 --> 22:15.367
You would've never had such
a beautiful daughter if it weren't for me.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.637
Can you give birth to a baby?
Then show us.

22:36.888 --> 22:39.991
Hey, beautiful. Drink with me.

22:43.128 --> 22:44.730
These are all your friends?

22:45.497 --> 22:47.532
My only friend is on my left.

22:50.769 --> 22:52.571
They're all her dad's friends.

22:52.971 --> 22:54.439
I'll introduce them.

22:54.573 --> 22:57.409
He's one of the top students
at Cambridge.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.945
Has three Ph.D.s and two Masters.

23:00.512 --> 23:02.047
No wonder he's so sophisticated.

23:02.581 --> 23:05.050
Don't be so mean.

23:06.785 --> 23:11.056
That one, not good-looking,
but he's rich.

23:11.389 --> 23:14.392
He's got an annual salary
of £3 million! Impressive.

23:16.762 --> 23:19.531
It's not possible for everyone
to be as handsome as I am.

23:20.398 --> 23:22.067
He's a psychiatrist.

23:22.534 --> 23:25.403
Enough! Am I on a dating show?

23:30.876 --> 23:33.779
Are you seeing someone?

23:37.549 --> 23:38.583
Okay.

23:39.151 --> 23:40.152
Impossible.

23:40.485 --> 23:43.789
For a strong woman like you,
finding a partner is difficult.

23:43.922 --> 23:47.025
You should hurry up
while you are still young.

23:47.192 --> 23:49.928
Find someone reliable.

23:53.732 --> 23:56.101
I'm sincerely thankful
for your concern.

24:05.644 --> 24:07.445
Getting old?

24:08.146 --> 24:10.148
I think I'm still in good shape.

24:31.536 --> 24:34.673
We've been so busy
preparing for the wedding...

24:34.806 --> 24:37.008
...arguing over who to invite...

24:37.142 --> 24:38.977
...that we almost called it off.

24:41.213 --> 24:42.514
Tu Tu...

24:44.115 --> 24:45.617
...thank you for being here.

24:47.185 --> 24:50.055
We're good friends.
Of course I have to be here.

24:50.188 --> 24:52.123
Let me know if you need anything
in London.

24:52.257 --> 24:54.593
-Okay.
-I gotta go.

24:55.827 --> 24:56.828
Hey, Lin Ran.

24:59.865 --> 25:02.901
Let's go for a drink.

25:03.535 --> 25:06.705
Another day.
Xuan Xuan is waiting for me.

25:06.938 --> 25:08.506
You know how busy we are.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.575
See you at the cake shop tomorrow.

26:00.158 --> 26:03.762
I thought that you would quit school
and start working...

26:03.895 --> 26:06.197
...after your parents passed away.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.634
But you stayed...

26:10.235 --> 26:12.037
...and now you're graduating.

26:12.304 --> 26:15.607
I have finally fulfilled
my parents' last wish.

26:15.974 --> 26:19.611
When I get a real job
and save some money...

26:19.778 --> 26:22.080
...I will go travel the world.

26:29.020 --> 26:30.155
To our friendship!

26:52.243 --> 26:53.378
Beautiful.

26:57.649 --> 26:59.250
It's so beautiful here.

27:11.629 --> 27:13.031
Stop! Stop!

27:23.808 --> 27:26.745
Hey, we're almost 30 years old.

27:27.145 --> 27:30.148
There is an old saying:
Start your family before your career.

27:30.281 --> 27:32.083
What do you think?

27:32.684 --> 27:34.185
Sounds good.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.761
Are you seeing someone?

28:11.222 --> 28:15.260
We are best friends.
We grew up together.

28:15.393 --> 28:18.063
It would be downright incestuous.

29:21.993 --> 29:22.994
Hey! Lin Ran.

29:23.128 --> 29:26.064
Gu Jia,
my head is going to explode.

29:26.197 --> 29:27.966
Do you have a minute?
I need to talk with you.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.400
Here, come help me.

29:34.506 --> 29:35.507
Try this.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.309
Give me one minute,
and I'll give you the world.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.544
Go away.

29:44.382 --> 29:45.850
You are here, Ms. Gu.

29:45.984 --> 29:47.485
Drop the "Ms."

29:48.219 --> 29:49.788
Gu Jia.

29:52.390 --> 29:55.560
Look at the way he eats.
It's so adorkable.

29:57.028 --> 29:58.096
Dorky and adorable.

30:00.899 --> 30:03.334
Lin Ran always says
what he likes most is my silliness.

30:03.468 --> 30:06.070
<i>He loves me so much</i>
<i>and always takes care of me.</i>

30:06.404 --> 30:08.173
<i>I can't live without him.</i>

30:11.442 --> 30:14.212
<i>This cupcake isn't bad.</i>
<i>Give it a try.</i>

30:19.551 --> 30:21.052
Xuan Xuan.

30:23.555 --> 30:24.556
What's wrong?

30:25.857 --> 30:26.858
Xuan Xuan.

30:28.326 --> 30:29.360
Stop.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.129
Too much information.

30:31.563 --> 30:34.365
-I'm going to the restroom.
-Okay.

30:52.617 --> 30:54.052
Forget it.

31:01.125 --> 31:05.096
Xuan Xuan's choosing the wine.
Shouldn't you be with her?

31:06.197 --> 31:09.067
She can take care of it.
I'm tired.

31:16.407 --> 31:19.277
So, Associate Producer
at the BBC...

31:19.644 --> 31:22.213
...your dream finally came true.

31:22.347 --> 31:23.948
Yes.

31:24.082 --> 31:26.050
So you're going to live
in London?

31:26.184 --> 31:27.886
Sure.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.656
No wonder
you look so hot right now.

31:32.924 --> 31:36.227
Really?
You never approve of my choices.

31:36.661 --> 31:37.896
Handsome!

31:41.199 --> 31:43.268
Extremely handsome?

31:44.002 --> 31:45.336
Don't be ridiculous.

31:47.205 --> 31:52.176
I'm just worried.
You changed yourself for someone else.

31:54.379 --> 31:57.382
When you are really in love...

31:57.515 --> 32:00.051
...nothing else really matters.

32:05.256 --> 32:08.192
I've been adrift for so long.

32:08.559 --> 32:11.296
Now I finally have somewhere
to settle down.

32:11.462 --> 32:14.165
Aren't you happy for me?

32:20.972 --> 32:22.173
I'm happy for you.

32:23.474 --> 32:24.475
Thanks!

32:25.610 --> 32:28.579
Have you ever been
on a double-decker bus?

32:28.713 --> 32:30.281
-Do you want to have a try?
-No.

32:30.415 --> 32:33.351
I haven't been on one for years.
Let's do it. Come on.

32:33.484 --> 32:35.553
I'm wearing high heels!

32:44.295 --> 32:45.997
Hey, look!

32:50.168 --> 32:52.603
Do you remember
that summer in Milan?

32:52.737 --> 32:55.440
You said we would travel
all around Italy on Vespa.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.476
Circling the Milan Cathedral.

32:58.609 --> 33:01.546
It's so easy to make you happy.

33:04.749 --> 33:08.453
It’s been so long
since we’ve spent time together.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.722
I've been in London for days.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.691
Is this how you take care
of your guests?

33:14.025 --> 33:15.360
My apologies.

33:17.762 --> 33:19.630
Today, I'm all yours.

33:19.764 --> 33:22.266
I'll take you wherever you want.

33:22.734 --> 33:23.735
Okay?

33:26.270 --> 33:28.673
Let's go.

33:34.779 --> 33:36.447
Wait for me.

33:38.483 --> 33:40.018
Come on, lady.

33:40.718 --> 33:41.753
Let's go.

33:42.086 --> 33:45.223
-Good weather today.
-Where are we going?

33:45.356 --> 33:47.058
Xuan Xuan

33:53.131 --> 33:54.565
Isn't that enough?

33:59.370 --> 34:01.639
Lin Ran ♥ Xuan Xuan

34:35.206 --> 34:37.175
<i>Editor, we need you back now!</i>

34:37.308 --> 34:40.411
<i>Lots of things are pending</i>
<i>your confirmation.</i>

34:40.578 --> 34:44.382
I'm still working on something
more important than Fashion Week.

34:44.515 --> 34:48.186
Send me my luggage
as soon as possible.

34:48.319 --> 34:49.854
<i>What about here in Milan?</i>

34:50.188 --> 34:51.556
Oh, right.
I forgot to tell you:

34:51.689 --> 34:53.257
You are now promoted
to editor-in-chief.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.293
<i>-Wait, what did you say?</i>
-Good luck!

34:55.426 --> 34:56.627
-Bye-bye.
<i>-I can't do it--</i>

35:56.354 --> 35:57.688
I'm the editor-in-chief.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.567
Let me search on Vipshop.

36:12.537 --> 36:14.772
It's almost 10:00 in Beijing.

36:15.339 --> 36:17.508
Let me see what's new.

36:26.951 --> 36:29.620
So, what did you ask me out for?

36:31.522 --> 36:34.792
I asked you out
to go shopping with me.

36:34.926 --> 36:38.429
Come on. Just spit it out.

36:41.599 --> 36:44.969
Yesterday, my mom asked...

36:45.937 --> 36:48.606
...if I was sure
I wanted to marry Lin Ran.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.342
Then my dad said...

36:51.475 --> 36:56.247
...if I do marry him,
maybe he should resign from the BBC...

36:56.380 --> 36:58.316
...and take over my father's company.

36:58.449 --> 36:59.684
Resign?

37:03.321 --> 37:04.455
I didn't say anything.

37:04.589 --> 37:07.491
But when I turned around,
Lin Ran was standing right behind me.

37:07.625 --> 37:09.293
Then he stormed out in a rage.

37:09.427 --> 37:11.596
I didn't even have a chance to explain.

37:11.929 --> 37:13.264
So?

37:15.499 --> 37:20.571
Gu Jia, what should I do
so he will forgive me?

37:22.673 --> 37:25.543
You didn't do anything wrong.
Why should you be forgiven?

37:25.876 --> 37:29.714
I have never seen him
so angry before...

37:30.548 --> 37:32.917
...like he would leave me
at any moment.

37:36.754 --> 37:39.657
Honestly, I think
you are still quite young.

37:40.591 --> 37:43.561
Are you sure
you want to get married this early?

37:44.695 --> 37:45.696
Of course.

37:45.830 --> 37:47.498
I love him.
I have to marry him!

37:47.632 --> 37:50.668
I will, and I must!

37:50.868 --> 37:53.638
Gu Jia, he's been mad
for two days...

37:53.838 --> 37:56.440
...over what my parents said.

37:56.841 --> 37:59.944
What's worse,
my ex-boyfriend texted me...

38:00.311 --> 38:01.979
...and he saw it.

38:02.413 --> 38:04.582
What if he refuses to marry me?

38:04.715 --> 38:06.584
Let me think about it.

38:10.521 --> 38:12.723
You should just tell him:

38:12.957 --> 38:15.026
"If you're going to get mad
when others try to be nice to you...

38:15.359 --> 38:17.695
...why should we stay together?"

38:22.466 --> 38:26.404
Wouldn't he get even angrier if I say that?

38:28.472 --> 38:29.473
Don't worry.

38:29.674 --> 38:30.875
Just listen to me...

38:31.008 --> 38:33.044
...and tell him what I said.

38:37.982 --> 38:40.017
I'll listen to you, Gu Jia.

38:41.886 --> 38:44.488
-Those shoes look amazing on you.
-Really?

39:11.349 --> 39:14.518
<i>I've heard that Karl's cats</i>
<i>make several million euros.</i>

39:14.685 --> 39:17.121
Shut up. Listen to me.

39:18.489 --> 39:19.590
<i>What?</i>

39:19.724 --> 39:20.725
Angelica.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.460
<i>-Angelica Cheung?</i>
-Yes, of <i>Vogue China.</i>

39:22.593 --> 39:24.462
<i>-She's good friends with the big boss.</i>
-I know!

39:24.595 --> 39:28.899
<i>If she sees you, then everyone</i>
<i>will know you aren't in Milan.</i>

39:32.737 --> 39:35.072
Send me my luggage right away.

39:42.747 --> 39:44.482
Come out.

40:09.707 --> 40:10.841
Gu Jia.

40:11.642 --> 40:14.412
What's wrong?
Where's Lin Ran?

40:14.979 --> 40:16.881
I did what you said.

40:21.819 --> 40:24.722
My parents just want what's best for us.

40:24.855 --> 40:26.690
What do you mean?

40:28.092 --> 40:31.695
You know, if you're going to get mad
when others try to be nice to you...

40:31.829 --> 40:34.799
...why should we stay together?

40:39.804 --> 40:42.573
-Then let's cancel the wedding.
-Lin Ran!

40:42.706 --> 40:44.809
<i>But Lin Ran just got even angrier.</i>

40:45.109 --> 40:46.977
Now he wants to cancel the wedding!

40:47.111 --> 40:49.580
Cancel the wedding!
Cancel the wedding!

40:49.713 --> 40:54.018
What should I do?
What should I do?

40:54.151 --> 40:56.086
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down!

40:59.190 --> 41:01.692
Let me talk to him.

41:11.902 --> 41:14.138
I've been looking for you.

41:18.576 --> 41:19.577
Why?

41:21.779 --> 41:23.113
You know why.

41:24.048 --> 41:25.649
You were right.

41:25.783 --> 41:27.918
The rich think about nothing but money.

41:28.052 --> 41:29.954
But that's not their fault.

41:30.087 --> 41:32.156
You are from different backgrounds.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.959
It's natural that you have different values.

41:41.632 --> 41:42.900
Is that what she said to you?

41:46.570 --> 41:47.838
Yep.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.611
Do me a favor and tell her...

41:53.777 --> 41:55.045
...she needs to understand:

41:55.212 --> 41:57.114
I am who I am.

41:57.248 --> 42:00.217
I am marrying her, not her family.

42:20.838 --> 42:22.106
Really?

42:24.041 --> 42:25.910
So, what should I do now?

42:28.279 --> 42:29.713
What to do....

42:31.048 --> 42:33.884
You should know by now
how he handles things.

42:34.051 --> 42:36.287
Maybe just leave him alone for a while.

42:36.620 --> 42:38.188
Leave him alone?

42:39.189 --> 42:44.628
Can you ask him
to not be left alone too long?

42:47.231 --> 42:49.266
Okay, I will talk to him again.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.336
That's great!
Gu Jia, that's really great!

42:58.142 --> 42:59.977
What is it?

43:00.778 --> 43:01.779
She said:

43:01.912 --> 43:04.982
"The ceremony is soon,
friends and family are all coming.

43:05.115 --> 43:06.884
Don't make your own life difficult--"

43:09.153 --> 43:10.921
Cancel the wedding!

43:14.625 --> 43:16.627
"Cancel the wedding"?

43:21.098 --> 43:22.099
Hey.

43:24.702 --> 43:25.703
Lin Ran!

43:28.906 --> 43:30.641
-Lin Ran.
-Stop following me.

43:32.876 --> 43:33.877
Calm down.

43:35.279 --> 43:37.681
-Stop being so mad.
-Leave me alone.

43:37.881 --> 43:39.683
Hey, I'm in heels!

43:40.184 --> 43:42.720
-Are you my best friend?
-Of course I am.

43:42.853 --> 43:44.154
So you understand me best?

43:49.793 --> 43:52.296
Actually, the first time I saw you two...

43:52.630 --> 43:54.832
...I felt like you were from different worlds.

43:54.965 --> 43:56.934
She lives in a luxurious house...

43:57.067 --> 43:59.803
...and grew up like a princess.

44:01.739 --> 44:03.007
Don't be silly.

44:03.140 --> 44:06.143
You don't think that becoming
an Associate Producer at the BBC...

44:06.276 --> 44:08.746
...and driving a convertible
can give her security.

44:09.179 --> 44:11.115
Do you know what she wants?

44:12.049 --> 44:14.251
An heir to the family.

44:14.852 --> 44:16.720
Wait, what did you just say?

44:18.055 --> 44:19.123
An heir.

44:19.256 --> 44:20.791
Not that.

44:22.192 --> 44:24.228
-Don't be silly.
-No.

44:27.131 --> 44:28.666
Security!

44:33.003 --> 44:34.438
I'm such a jerk.

44:37.374 --> 44:38.742
Lin Ran!

44:52.122 --> 44:53.257
Gu Jia.

44:55.993 --> 44:57.127
Gu Jia.

44:58.228 --> 45:01.465
Now I can't help loving you
more than ever.

45:05.702 --> 45:08.338
Lin Ran is very lucky
to have such a great friend.

45:09.039 --> 45:10.074
That's good.

45:12.443 --> 45:16.146
You know, we've already talked it over.

45:16.280 --> 45:18.849
We will speak to my parents together.

45:18.982 --> 45:21.385
He is not good at doing business.

45:22.286 --> 45:24.254
I won't force him to do anything.

45:24.888 --> 45:26.356
As long as he is by my side...

45:26.490 --> 45:27.958
...I have security.

45:28.092 --> 45:30.194
That's all I need.

45:32.229 --> 45:33.464
Security....

45:35.332 --> 45:36.967
It's good you made up.

45:37.267 --> 45:39.002
It's good that you figured it out.

45:39.136 --> 45:41.405
Otherwise,
he might have started traveling again...

45:41.738 --> 45:43.841
...and left you alone.

45:43.974 --> 45:45.909
Wouldn't that suck?

45:51.014 --> 45:52.349
Excuse me.

45:56.353 --> 45:58.922
-Xuan Xuan.
-Never be angry like that again.

46:08.499 --> 46:12.870
"Gu Jia, I can't help loving you
more than ever."

47:47.397 --> 47:49.199
What's happening?
Still can't reach her?

47:49.333 --> 47:51.034
She's not answering her phone.

47:53.937 --> 47:57.307
Don't worry. She's an adult.

47:57.874 --> 47:59.543
I shouldn't worry
just because she's an adult?

47:59.876 --> 48:02.546
She is new in town.

48:04.348 --> 48:08.085
You haven't heard from the hotel?
Where would she go?

48:08.318 --> 48:10.387
What worries me is that she took my car.

48:10.520 --> 48:13.156
She can barely drive.

48:13.290 --> 48:15.959
This is the U.K. She doesn't
even know which side to drive on.

48:16.093 --> 48:19.029
What if she's in an accident
and someone gets hurt?

49:16.286 --> 49:17.454
Hello?

49:18.322 --> 49:19.656
Who is this?

49:19.990 --> 49:21.391
Why do you have Gu Jia's phone?

49:22.059 --> 49:24.561
Don't worry, Gu Jia's fine.
She drank a bit much.

49:24.695 --> 49:26.563
<i>Where is Gu Jia?</i>
<i>I'll come pick her up now!</i>

49:26.697 --> 49:29.966
I'll tell her to call you back
when she wakes up. Bye.

49:30.133 --> 49:31.368
Hey. Hey!

49:38.241 --> 49:39.509
<i>Tu Tu!</i>

49:41.244 --> 49:42.512
Tu Tu!

49:47.284 --> 49:48.719
Tu Tu.

49:50.287 --> 49:51.722
Lin Ran.

49:52.055 --> 49:54.024
What's wrong with you?

49:54.157 --> 49:55.692
He doesn't want me.

49:56.026 --> 49:58.662
It's his loss.
Why did you drink so much?

49:58.995 --> 50:01.398
I'm not a bad-looking girl.

50:01.531 --> 50:02.999
Okay, get up.

50:03.133 --> 50:07.104
Why doesn't he want me?

50:08.538 --> 50:10.440
Lin Ran.

50:11.341 --> 50:15.112
No one loves me.

50:22.753 --> 50:24.020
Why are you here?

50:30.160 --> 50:33.530
Your Lin Ran just called.

50:33.697 --> 50:35.198
Lin Ran?

50:38.435 --> 50:40.570
How do you know him?

50:41.772 --> 50:45.375
I know everything about you guys
since you were 3.

50:52.349 --> 50:53.717
You know...

50:55.051 --> 50:57.421
...when he was on the phone just now...

50:58.488 --> 51:00.290
...he sounded....

51:02.459 --> 51:05.095
What?
Worried about me?

51:08.465 --> 51:09.599
Anxious.

51:17.340 --> 51:19.176
Let me reintroduce myself.

51:20.110 --> 51:21.344
Gu Jia.

51:23.380 --> 51:25.081
I'm Nick.

51:49.239 --> 51:51.208
What happened?
Where were you last night?

51:51.341 --> 51:53.577
I was looking for you all night!

51:53.710 --> 51:54.878
-You were worried?
-Of course!

51:55.212 --> 51:56.847
If something happened to you,
how could I get married?

51:57.180 --> 52:00.484
I'm just a bridesmaid, not the bride!
Why are you so mad?

52:09.326 --> 52:11.261
-Gu Jia!
-Be careful.

52:11.394 --> 52:13.263
You're finally here.

52:13.396 --> 52:15.298
You don't know how worried
he was last night.

52:15.432 --> 52:16.533
He almost called the police.

52:16.666 --> 52:17.801
-Really?
-Yeah.

52:18.134 --> 52:19.402
She was at my place.

52:19.536 --> 52:20.770
It was you?

52:20.904 --> 52:22.239
Nick, my boyfriend.

52:22.372 --> 52:23.640
-Hi.
-Hi.

52:23.773 --> 52:25.775
Congratulations to you.

52:27.544 --> 52:28.612
Congrats to you two.

52:28.745 --> 52:30.180
Thanks.

52:30.747 --> 52:32.816
Okay, why don't we go inside.

52:33.149 --> 52:34.150
Let's go.

52:34.284 --> 52:35.719
It's rather windy.

52:42.225 --> 52:43.793
Where'd this boyfriend come from?

52:43.927 --> 52:45.195
Are you really dating?

52:45.328 --> 52:47.430
You didn't tell me
you were getting married either.

52:47.564 --> 52:48.798
This is so sudden.

52:48.932 --> 52:50.934
Why can't I have a boyfriend?

52:51.268 --> 52:52.903
You got drunk
and didn't come back last night.

52:53.236 --> 52:54.237
What's wrong with you?

52:54.371 --> 52:56.473
This is your first time in London.
Do you think that's appropriate?

52:56.606 --> 52:58.475
Now all of a sudden
you have a boyfriend?

52:58.608 --> 53:00.944
Hey, that's not
a big deal nowadays, right?

53:01.278 --> 53:02.279
Right?

53:02.412 --> 53:04.381
-What's the matter?
-Right!

53:05.382 --> 53:06.383
These are my parents.

53:06.616 --> 53:07.884
How are you, auntie?

53:09.953 --> 53:11.821
-Congratulations.
-He's Gu Jia's friend.

53:12.455 --> 53:13.456
Her boyfriend.

53:13.590 --> 53:15.525
-Thank you.
-A fine young man he is.

53:15.792 --> 53:18.929
Hey, Lin Ran is going
to go play soccer with the guys.

53:19.262 --> 53:21.531
You should invite Nick to join them.

53:21.665 --> 53:22.666
Can you play?

53:25.468 --> 53:26.937
Lin Ran, come on!

53:30.240 --> 53:31.575
Come on!

54:07.711 --> 54:08.845
Lin Ran, come on!

54:22.258 --> 54:23.560
Come on!

54:35.772 --> 54:37.340
You're a good player.

54:37.474 --> 54:39.042
So are you.

54:42.278 --> 54:44.948
When did you meet Gu Jia?

54:46.416 --> 54:50.987
We met a few days ago
on the flight to London.

54:51.321 --> 54:53.490
What? A few days ago?

54:53.623 --> 54:56.026
She caught my eye immediately.

54:56.359 --> 54:58.395
Love at first sight probably.

54:58.995 --> 55:00.330
Ridiculous!

55:36.800 --> 55:40.737
-I think our game is working.
-Really?

55:40.870 --> 55:42.806
You see the way he's looking at you?

55:46.943 --> 55:48.545
Hold me tighter.

55:52.482 --> 55:54.851
Do you want to take it
to another level?

55:55.418 --> 55:57.120
Sure. How?

55:57.921 --> 55:59.589
Take a seat.

56:11.067 --> 56:13.737
The love between
Lin Ran and Xuan Xuan...

56:14.003 --> 56:16.639
...has touched me deeply.

56:17.107 --> 56:19.776
So please allow me
to make a toast...

56:19.909 --> 56:22.612
...and dedicate a song
to the goddess of my heart:

56:23.046 --> 56:24.114
Gu Jia.

58:02.645 --> 58:06.950
Gu Jia, I've always dreamed
of having my wedding in a cathedral.

58:07.083 --> 58:09.953
Just like a prince and princess.

58:10.086 --> 58:12.956
Baby, no matter
where the wedding is...

58:13.089 --> 58:15.625
...you are always my princess.

58:16.259 --> 58:18.495
You're my prince, too.

58:19.863 --> 58:20.964
Wow, it's so cold.

58:22.499 --> 58:24.801
By the way, Gu Jia,
I can book this place...

58:24.934 --> 58:27.804
-...for your and Nick's wedding, too.
-Sure.

58:27.937 --> 58:30.707
Baby, I don't think they're
getting married anytime soon.

58:31.241 --> 58:32.909
That's not necessarily true.

58:34.077 --> 58:36.279
We both like to keep things simple.

58:36.613 --> 58:40.283
But for the wedding,
it has to be a romantic location.

58:40.617 --> 58:42.685
-What about Santorini?
-Santorini!

58:42.819 --> 58:44.954
That sounds amazing.

58:45.088 --> 58:46.589
Gu Jia, we need to talk.

58:47.624 --> 58:48.958
Baby, I'll be right back.

58:49.092 --> 58:50.660
Baby, I'll be right back.

58:54.998 --> 58:56.633
Now what?

58:59.736 --> 59:02.972
You're already talking marriage
after knowing him a few days?

59:03.106 --> 59:05.208
You've never been like this.

59:05.675 --> 59:07.544
Aren't you getting
a little carried away?

59:07.677 --> 59:08.678
Not really.

59:09.212 --> 59:10.813
-He's handsome.
-So what?

59:10.947 --> 59:12.582
Can "handsome" pay the bills?

59:14.918 --> 59:17.820
-And you want to marry him?
-Why are you getting mad?

59:22.592 --> 59:23.993
Are you jealous?

59:28.865 --> 59:30.166
Jealous?

59:30.300 --> 59:32.035
I'm just worried about you!

59:34.337 --> 59:36.072
I'm getting married soon.

59:36.973 --> 59:39.742
I won't be around to comfort you
if he breaks your heart.

59:40.276 --> 59:42.612
So don't get married.

59:43.813 --> 59:45.014
Is everything okay?

59:46.182 --> 59:47.684
We're just talking.

59:48.217 --> 59:50.687
Why don't you just take her
away from me.

59:51.888 --> 59:54.357
What do you mean?
We're not allowed to talk?

59:55.358 --> 59:56.926
She's my girlfriend now.

59:57.060 --> 59:58.194
Stop it.

59:58.328 --> 1:00:00.229
You've known each other
for a few days.

1:00:00.363 --> 1:00:03.132
Do you know how long
I've known her? Do you?

1:00:06.769 --> 1:00:07.770
What?

1:00:14.944 --> 1:00:16.913
Let's stop making fun of him.

1:00:18.648 --> 1:00:21.250
Actually, she's not my cup of tea.
You are.

1:00:25.054 --> 1:00:26.389
What's going on here?

1:00:28.992 --> 1:00:32.095
Gu Jia told me how you worry
that she doesn't have a boyfriend.

1:00:32.228 --> 1:00:34.731
-Right!
-So we pretended to be dating.

1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:39.869
So he is...?

1:00:44.073 --> 1:00:46.342
You two have gone too far.

1:00:46.676 --> 1:00:49.212
Pretending to be together.
Do you know how worried I was?

1:00:49.345 --> 1:00:50.346
-I'm just afraid that--

1:00:52.115 --> 1:00:54.917
What? So you don't like
people like me?

1:01:21.277 --> 1:01:23.046
I hope it wasn't too much.

1:01:27.884 --> 1:01:28.985
Let's go.

1:01:29.986 --> 1:01:32.255
You're wasting too much time on this.

1:01:32.388 --> 1:01:33.923
It's fun.

1:01:35.024 --> 1:01:37.694
I told you he still loves you.

1:01:37.827 --> 1:01:40.730
What you need to do
is find an opportunity...

1:01:41.197 --> 1:01:43.466
...to tell him that you love him.

1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:44.801
What?

1:01:44.934 --> 1:01:46.469
You know what I'm saying.

1:01:48.071 --> 1:01:51.340
No way!
They're about to get married!

1:01:51.474 --> 1:01:54.077
I'd be crazy to tell him
that I love him now!

1:01:54.210 --> 1:01:57.213
What do I do if he says no?
What do I do if he says yes?

1:01:57.346 --> 1:01:59.415
How do you know if you don't try?

1:02:02.952 --> 1:02:04.187
I'm going.

1:02:09.726 --> 1:02:10.927
You can do it.

1:02:29.812 --> 1:02:32.749
Lin Ran, time flies.

1:02:32.882 --> 1:02:35.084
I wish we could go back
to the old days.

1:02:35.218 --> 1:02:37.854
Do you remember I told you...

1:02:37.987 --> 1:02:40.223
...that I wanted to travel
around the world?

1:02:41.023 --> 1:02:42.091
Of course.

1:02:42.225 --> 1:02:45.261
And you wanted me to go with you.

1:02:45.394 --> 1:02:47.230
You're lucky
that you didn't follow me.

1:02:47.363 --> 1:02:49.232
I lost interest in everything
by the end.

1:02:49.365 --> 1:02:50.967
I even thought about jumping
in the river.

1:02:51.868 --> 1:02:53.536
The way you talk is still so dramatic.

1:02:53.870 --> 1:02:58.141
I think of myself as a firefly.

1:02:58.274 --> 1:03:00.810
At least I still have
that little light on my butt.

1:03:00.943 --> 1:03:04.080
You wanted to light up
the whole world.

1:03:08.017 --> 1:03:11.220
But I lost that last bit of light
later on.

1:03:11.354 --> 1:03:15.124
And I became no better than a fly.

1:03:16.359 --> 1:03:18.461
That's not true.
You're doing great.

1:03:19.862 --> 1:03:23.499
I'm not like you. You work like
you have a motor inside you.

1:03:23.833 --> 1:03:26.569
Of course.
I try my best and I go for it!

1:03:28.171 --> 1:03:30.439
I've found my motor now.

1:03:31.274 --> 1:03:32.975
It's Xuan Xuan.

1:03:37.980 --> 1:03:40.283
She's different from other girls.

1:03:41.284 --> 1:03:44.153
She supports me,
no matter what I do.

1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:48.224
I want to be a better man
and protect her.

1:03:51.027 --> 1:03:53.129
I need to be protected, too.

1:03:55.298 --> 1:03:57.200
I should have given you
more support.

1:04:01.103 --> 1:04:02.905
Ever since my parents passed away...

1:04:03.039 --> 1:04:05.074
...you've always been by my side...

1:04:05.208 --> 1:04:06.876
...all the time.

1:04:10.446 --> 1:04:15.618
This may be the last time
we get to spend time alone.

1:04:18.988 --> 1:04:21.023
Not even for a cup of coffee?

1:04:24.360 --> 1:04:26.562
Marriage is wonderful.

1:04:27.597 --> 1:04:29.632
It's like a contract.

1:04:29.966 --> 1:04:34.003
Once you sign,
responsibilities follow.

1:04:35.271 --> 1:04:38.174
Everything changes.

1:04:41.310 --> 1:04:43.379
You can choose not to sign.

1:04:43.512 --> 1:04:44.947
Why wouldn't I?

1:04:45.081 --> 1:04:46.115
I love Xuan Xuan.

1:04:46.249 --> 1:04:47.450
I love her and only her.

1:04:48.117 --> 1:04:51.020
She always says,
if you love someone...

1:04:51.153 --> 1:04:54.557
...you need to shout it out loud, or--

1:04:57.627 --> 1:04:59.395
You might lose your chance.

1:05:19.115 --> 1:05:20.449
You lost your chance again.

1:05:21.083 --> 1:05:23.920
You still haven't spoken your heart?

1:05:25.154 --> 1:05:26.989
Speak my heart?

1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:32.628
Tell him I love him?

1:05:35.564 --> 1:05:37.633
It's too late.

1:05:41.003 --> 1:05:43.506
Just find a way
to postpone the wedding.

1:05:51.414 --> 1:05:53.015
How's that possible?

1:06:01.457 --> 1:06:03.960
It's now or never.

1:06:25.548 --> 1:06:28.651
I must get the special discount.

1:06:33.689 --> 1:06:35.725
Hi, Gu Jia speaking.

1:06:36.058 --> 1:06:37.393
<i>Is this Ma Li?</i>

1:06:39.261 --> 1:06:40.329
Editor?

1:06:43.265 --> 1:06:46.335
Can you help me postpone...

1:06:48.237 --> 1:06:50.373
...Lin Ran's wedding
at the cathedral tomorrow?

1:06:51.173 --> 1:06:52.541
Postpone it?

1:06:53.476 --> 1:06:56.779
Editor, are you finally pursuing
your own happiness?

1:06:57.113 --> 1:06:58.748
Editor,
we don't need to confirm the event.

1:06:59.081 --> 1:07:01.183
-It's canceled.
-Canceled?

1:07:03.285 --> 1:07:04.620
Okay, I'll do it now.

1:07:08.290 --> 1:07:09.558
Thank you.

1:07:12.661 --> 1:07:14.130
I'm so bad.

1:07:25.508 --> 1:07:28.744
No matter what happens....

1:07:36.218 --> 1:07:37.286
Tu Tu!

1:07:37.820 --> 1:07:39.121
Tu Tu!

1:07:39.755 --> 1:07:40.756
Gu Jia!

1:07:41.257 --> 1:07:42.258
What's going on?

1:07:44.760 --> 1:07:46.529
The cathedral canceled the wedding!

1:07:48.831 --> 1:07:50.433
"Canceled"?

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:52.735
Wasn't it postponed?

1:07:53.469 --> 1:07:54.503
"Postponed"?

1:07:55.638 --> 1:07:57.173
I mean....

1:07:57.573 --> 1:07:58.707
Can they postpone it?

1:08:12.221 --> 1:08:15.624
Hey, can you stop pacing
back and forth like that?

1:08:18.461 --> 1:08:19.695
What can I do?

1:08:22.731 --> 1:08:25.701
Let nature take its course.

1:08:30.306 --> 1:08:31.674
Tu Tu, answer me.

1:08:32.241 --> 1:08:36.278
Every girl has a dream wedding
in mind, right?

1:08:36.412 --> 1:08:37.413
Yes.

1:08:40.116 --> 1:08:42.318
I must give her the best.

1:08:45.354 --> 1:08:48.524
My girl has to be
the happiest in the world.

1:08:53.362 --> 1:08:55.764
Stay away from the platform edge.

1:08:55.898 --> 1:08:57.366
I must think of a solution.

1:08:57.500 --> 1:08:58.634
Come closer.

1:08:58.767 --> 1:09:00.769
She's always dreamt
of a wedding in a cathedral.

1:09:00.903 --> 1:09:03.339
I can't even make that happen.

1:09:03.472 --> 1:09:05.341
You always give her
whatever she wants!

1:09:05.474 --> 1:09:08.644
If she truly wants to marry you,
does the location really matter?!

1:09:12.615 --> 1:09:13.616
Come closer.

1:09:14.917 --> 1:09:16.452
It's dangerous.

1:09:49.852 --> 1:09:52.254
Aren't you coming in with me?

1:09:53.489 --> 1:09:56.792
I'll be there in a minute.

1:09:56.926 --> 1:09:58.260
Okay.

1:10:21.884 --> 1:10:25.654
Ma Li, I told you
to postpone the wedding.

1:10:25.788 --> 1:10:27.356
Why did you cancel it?

1:10:27.489 --> 1:10:29.692
<i>What? What was canceled?</i>

1:10:30.893 --> 1:10:32.328
The wedding!

1:10:32.461 --> 1:10:36.365
<i>Editor, I forgot to tell you</i>
<i>that I couldn't reach them.</i>

1:10:36.498 --> 1:10:37.866
Couldn't reach them?

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.436
<i>Yeah. It was canceled?</i>

1:10:40.970 --> 1:10:43.839
<i>Editor, it's probably meant to be.</i>

1:10:43.973 --> 1:10:45.541
Really?

1:10:45.674 --> 1:10:48.677
<i>Editor, you must take this chance.</i>

1:10:55.918 --> 1:10:57.920
As long as you are happy,
I can do anything.

1:10:58.254 --> 1:10:59.622
Do you like this place?

1:11:00.723 --> 1:11:01.724
Great!

1:11:03.993 --> 1:11:07.529
I will listen to you regarding
all family matters.

1:11:07.663 --> 1:11:08.864
Okay, baby?

1:11:08.998 --> 1:11:09.999
Okay.

1:11:11.834 --> 1:11:14.670
Tu Tu, come here.

1:11:18.641 --> 1:11:20.009
You were right.

1:11:20.409 --> 1:11:23.579
I told Xuan Xuan
about the cancellation.

1:11:24.013 --> 1:11:25.881
I guess I got worried over nothing.

1:11:26.015 --> 1:11:29.451
She said that the location
isn't important.

1:11:29.585 --> 1:11:33.555
What's important is
that we're together.

1:11:41.463 --> 1:11:42.531
Take the call.

1:11:43.499 --> 1:11:44.566
Baby!

1:11:46.902 --> 1:11:48.737
-Are you choosing the bouquet?
-Yeah, look at this.

1:11:48.871 --> 1:11:50.039
Editor, you can do it!

1:11:50.372 --> 1:11:51.373
This one is good.

1:11:51.507 --> 1:11:53.542
-Yeah, this one is pretty.
-Yes.

1:11:55.544 --> 1:11:57.513
<i>It's so easy to make you happy.</i>

1:11:57.646 --> 1:11:59.048
<i>I came here to be the bride!</i>

1:12:09.625 --> 1:12:11.360
How do you know if you don't try?

1:12:12.528 --> 1:12:15.030
There should be more roses
at the wedding venue.

1:12:22.438 --> 1:12:23.906
So beautiful.

1:12:24.406 --> 1:12:25.641
What is this place?

1:12:26.108 --> 1:12:27.409
Right, baby?

1:12:27.543 --> 1:12:28.744
Hey, Lin Ran.

1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:33.649
I think I found a place
for the wedding.

1:12:34.983 --> 1:12:35.984
Really?

1:12:38.354 --> 1:12:39.421
Awesome!

1:13:57.866 --> 1:13:59.168
You look great.

1:13:59.968 --> 1:14:01.703
Why aren't you ready yet?

1:14:03.539 --> 1:14:07.176
I've just finished an event.
I'll get changed.

1:14:09.144 --> 1:14:10.479
How's Xuan Xuan?

1:14:10.612 --> 1:14:14.082
Relax, I got her the best hairdresser
and makeup artist. She's in good hands.

1:14:15.751 --> 1:14:19.788
By the way, you aren't allowed
to see the bride before the ceremony.

1:14:21.890 --> 1:14:22.991
Thank you.

1:14:26.228 --> 1:14:28.964
If you really want to thank me...

1:14:30.566 --> 1:14:31.767
...take a walk with me.

1:14:59.595 --> 1:15:01.163
Do you remember this place?

1:15:05.667 --> 1:15:07.035
Stop! Stop!

1:15:19.047 --> 1:15:20.782
Lin Ran, I need to tell you--

1:15:21.083 --> 1:15:22.184
Tu Tu.

1:15:22.851 --> 1:15:26.021
Before you say anything,
I'd like to ask you something.

1:15:30.158 --> 1:15:31.193
Okay.

1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:34.563
Did you ask Nick to cancel
the wedding at the cathedral?

1:15:42.771 --> 1:15:45.073
I've been investigating.

1:15:47.009 --> 1:15:49.244
I heard back from the cathedral.

1:15:50.779 --> 1:15:54.216
They said someone named Nick
canceled it.

1:15:55.117 --> 1:15:57.119
I didn't ask him to do anything!

1:15:57.252 --> 1:15:59.221
Why did he do that?

1:16:02.024 --> 1:16:03.225
Tu Tu...

1:16:03.859 --> 1:16:04.927
...why?!

1:16:06.595 --> 1:16:08.764
Why did you ask him
to cancel my wedding?

1:16:10.832 --> 1:16:12.634
You're my best friend...

1:16:12.768 --> 1:16:14.970
...the most important person
in the world to me.

1:16:15.103 --> 1:16:18.206
I invited you to my wedding,
hoping to share my happiness.

1:16:18.340 --> 1:16:22.110
I remember it was exactly here...

1:16:23.245 --> 1:16:25.047
...where you asked me...

1:16:25.180 --> 1:16:28.784
...if I could give you a chance
and be with you.

1:16:31.320 --> 1:16:34.923
I want to say yes now.

1:16:36.825 --> 1:16:39.194
If the wedding must go on...

1:16:40.228 --> 1:16:43.732
...I wish I could be the bride.

1:16:46.802 --> 1:16:49.271
If you also want to be with me...

1:16:51.873 --> 1:16:53.742
...I can be the bad guy...

1:16:53.875 --> 1:16:56.011
...and explain everything
to the guests.

1:16:58.847 --> 1:17:00.115
Lin Ran...

1:17:00.749 --> 1:17:02.184
...choose me.

1:17:03.385 --> 1:17:05.153
I will bring you happiness.

1:17:27.943 --> 1:17:29.077
Tu Tu...

1:17:30.979 --> 1:17:32.214
...stop it.

1:17:32.681 --> 1:17:34.016
It's in the past.

1:17:35.717 --> 1:17:38.987
I need to protect someone else now.

1:17:41.156 --> 1:17:42.724
Don't be like that.

1:17:46.962 --> 1:17:48.363
I understand.

1:18:12.721 --> 1:18:15.323
Xuan Xuan! Xuan Xuan!

1:18:23.432 --> 1:18:24.433
Xuan Xuan!

1:18:28.070 --> 1:18:29.271
Xuan Xuan!

1:18:47.355 --> 1:18:50.358
Stop, Xuan Xuan!
It's not what you think!

1:18:56.932 --> 1:18:58.100
Xuan Xuan!

1:19:09.044 --> 1:19:10.312
Stop chasing me!

1:19:10.445 --> 1:19:11.446
Stop!

1:19:28.864 --> 1:19:29.898
Stop.

1:19:30.031 --> 1:19:31.032
Xuan Xuan!

1:19:37.105 --> 1:19:38.273
Xuan Xuan.

1:19:48.550 --> 1:19:50.018
Xuan Xuan!

1:19:51.153 --> 1:19:52.154
Xuan Xuan!

1:19:59.127 --> 1:20:00.162
Xuan Xuan!

1:20:10.806 --> 1:20:12.040
Xuan Xuan!

1:20:17.546 --> 1:20:21.183
Don't come any closer,
or I'll throw myself against the wall!

1:20:22.017 --> 1:20:23.151
Go ahead.

1:20:24.286 --> 1:20:26.154
I can be the bride if you're dead.

1:20:27.022 --> 1:20:28.456
I knew I was right.

1:20:30.025 --> 1:20:32.360
You are in love with Lin Ran!

1:20:32.828 --> 1:20:33.962
Right!

1:20:34.095 --> 1:20:37.098
The whole world knows,
except you.

1:20:43.305 --> 1:20:44.940
You finally admit it.

1:20:47.209 --> 1:20:50.111
You tricked us into coming here
to try to win him back.

1:20:50.946 --> 1:20:53.215
I'm telling you
that is not gonna happen!

1:20:57.519 --> 1:20:58.553
Yes...

1:20:59.187 --> 1:21:01.323
...I have been trying
to get him back

1:21:02.991 --> 1:21:06.094
Because I never thought
he would leave me one day.

1:21:14.135 --> 1:21:15.470
You know...

1:21:16.071 --> 1:21:18.940
...I really disliked you
the first day we met.

1:21:21.009 --> 1:21:24.179
You were so cute and innocent.

1:21:25.313 --> 1:21:27.182
It made me sick.

1:21:30.652 --> 1:21:32.621
But in Lin Ran's eyes...

1:21:32.954 --> 1:21:34.222
...you are precious.

1:21:35.190 --> 1:21:37.525
He would do anything
to protect you.

1:21:43.498 --> 1:21:44.633
And me?

1:21:44.966 --> 1:21:49.237
To him, I will always be
his best friend.

1:21:50.906 --> 1:21:54.276
You will regret it, as I do,
if you don't go back now.

1:21:56.111 --> 1:21:57.279
Xuan Xuan!

1:21:59.648 --> 1:22:02.450
Xuan Xuan! Xuan Xuan.

1:22:05.153 --> 1:22:06.388
Xuan Xuan.

1:22:23.004 --> 1:22:24.005
Marry me.

1:24:16.718 --> 1:24:18.787
Tu Tu, trust me.

1:24:19.421 --> 1:24:21.289
You will find your own happiness.

1:25:10.138 --> 1:25:11.206
Hey...

1:25:11.706 --> 1:25:13.141
...I'm here.
