NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:07.808 --> 00:11.312
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.447
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:13.481 --> 00:15.449
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:15.483 --> 00:17.318
are members of an elite squad

00:17.351 --> 00:19.320
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.021
These are their stories.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.459
It looks like a good six inches
of standing water.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.595
It's perfect
breeding conditions.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.630
Center for
Disease Control.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.632
Terrorists poisoned the water?

00:31.665 --> 00:33.167
No, ma'am, we're
just screening

00:33.201 --> 00:34.402
for mosquito
infestation.

00:34.435 --> 00:35.403
That bug spray?

00:35.436 --> 00:37.305
No, it's an aspirator.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.306
It collects specimens,

00:38.339 --> 00:40.208
which are then sent back
to Atlanta for testing.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.209
For what?

00:41.242 --> 00:42.210
West Nile virus.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.677
We have that
on this block?

00:43.711 --> 00:45.479
No, this is just
random testing.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.515
Nothing to worry about.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.284
Could be something
in the bag, maybe.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.519
Let's check it out.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.692
Oh, my God.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.694
Please.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.630
Tell me that's a baby doll.

01:07.568 --> 01:11.605
Captioning sponsored by
UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

01:11.639 --> 01:14.542
and NBC

01:54.682 --> 01:55.916
Newborn. Caucasian female.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.218
Five, six pounds tops.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.219
Tossed down the sewer.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.287
If the water'd
been any higher,

01:59.320 --> 02:01.889
little tike'd been washed
out to the East River.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.627
Umbilical cord's
still attached.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.696
Tied off with
dental floss.

02:08.729 --> 02:09.697
We got a home birth.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.399
Newborns are
ten times more likely

02:11.432 --> 02:13.767
to be killed their first day
of life than any other time.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.170
So, odds are we're looking
at a mom who freaked out?

02:16.204 --> 02:19.607
There's no obvious trauma.
ME here yet?

02:19.640 --> 02:20.841
En route,

02:20.874 --> 02:22.743
but the guy that
found it is a doctor.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.478
Knows a thing or two.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.679
Endocrinologist.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.715
Actually, I'm
an entomologist.

02:27.748 --> 02:30.718
I was studying larval activity
and I found blowfly

02:30.751 --> 02:31.719
on the body.

02:31.752 --> 02:32.586
Maggots.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.555
Freshly laid-- which
tells me she had not

02:34.588 --> 02:35.789
been down there more
than three hours.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.425
Well, if it was the mom,

02:37.458 --> 02:39.927
she couldn't have traveled far
this soon after delivery.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.262
If she lives nearby,

02:41.295 --> 02:42.330
it shouldn't be too hard

02:42.363 --> 02:43.831
to find a new mom
missing a baby.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.604
Yeah, we got a tenant
about to pop.

02:50.638 --> 02:51.405
Name's Brianna Morris.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.741
Moved into 2-H
three months ago.

02:53.774 --> 02:54.942
Who with?

02:54.975 --> 02:56.710
Nobody. So she said.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.946
Didn't mention
she was pregnant.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.514
It's a hard thing to hide.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.915
Well, she wore bulky clothes.

03:01.949 --> 03:04.318
When it became obvious,
I made a passing inquiry.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.319
She denied it.

03:05.353 --> 03:06.787
How old a girl
are we talking?

03:06.820 --> 03:07.988
Uh... early twenties.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.357
Boyfriends?

03:09.390 --> 03:12.293
No, not that I
was introduced to.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.495
Miss Morris!

03:14.528 --> 03:18.632
I got a leak down in 1-H,
gotta check your pipes.

03:18.666 --> 03:19.800
You there?!

03:22.503 --> 03:23.637
Miss Morris!

03:23.671 --> 03:24.805
I got some people with me.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.711
Yo.

03:30.744 --> 03:31.812
I don't think Mom

03:31.845 --> 03:32.946
got rid of the baby.

03:32.980 --> 03:36.350
I don't think she made it
out of the delivery room.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.618
Dead.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.688
Then who dumped that baby?

03:42.956 --> 03:46.560
I can't imagine who would do
something that horrible.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.829
Brianna have any
family or friends?

03:48.862 --> 03:50.798
Not that she
ever mentioned.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.334
You two were friendly.

03:53.367 --> 03:56.537
She helped me
with my groceries...

03:56.570 --> 03:57.738
and she picked up

03:57.771 --> 04:00.874
some birdseed once
when I ran out.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.377
This was at my
birthday in August.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.713
Hardly the life
of the party, huh?

04:05.746 --> 04:06.880
She was a sad girl,

04:06.914 --> 04:09.049
but my birds just loved her,

04:09.082 --> 04:11.819
so she must have
been a good person.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.621
Was there a daddy
in the picture?

04:13.654 --> 04:14.888
No.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.490
Any prospective
step-daddies?

04:16.524 --> 04:18.859
Not since she
moved here.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.363
Poor thing... was always alone.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.064
We know she had
a visitor last night

04:24.097 --> 04:25.333
or early this morning.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.400
Did you see anyone?

04:26.434 --> 04:27.535
No.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.737
Hear anything?

04:29.770 --> 04:30.938
I'm sorry.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.907
I'm stone deaf without this.

04:33.941 --> 04:37.545
The little buggers make so
much noise in the morning,

04:37.578 --> 04:39.613
I just put it in an hour ago.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.617
I heard someone knocking
over there about 6:00 a.m.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.386
Must have been
banging pretty loud.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.854
No, just regular.
I work from home.

04:46.887 --> 04:47.755
My desk is right
by the door.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.857
What'd you hear
after that?
Not a peep.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.025
A woman had a friggin'
baby across the hall

04:52.059 --> 04:53.060
and you don't hear that?

04:53.093 --> 04:54.862
I don't know.
She was a quiet girl.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.665
No woman's quiet
during childbirth.

04:57.698 --> 04:58.699
Sorry.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.869
Nobody saw or heard anything.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.737
Or bothered
to get to know her.

05:03.771 --> 05:04.905
Okay, a girl that age

05:04.938 --> 05:06.507
carrying that
kind of baggage

05:06.540 --> 05:07.908
had to reach
out to somebody.

05:07.941 --> 05:08.709
Mm-hmm.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.711
Someone helped
deliver this baby.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.912
Even cleaned up the afterbirth.

05:11.945 --> 05:12.980
So how did
he kill her?

05:13.013 --> 05:14.748
I can't rule yet
that anyone did.

05:14.782 --> 05:15.783
Like mother like daughter.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.885
I've got no obvious cause
of death on either.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.087
Are you saying they might've
died in childbirth?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.623
You rarely see it nowadays,
but Mom could've had

05:22.656 --> 05:24.892
a blood or amniotic fluid
clot, even a stroke.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.760
I'll let you know
after the autopsies.

05:26.794 --> 05:27.761
Phone line works.

05:27.795 --> 05:28.729
She should have
called for help.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.898
Well, killers don't usually
encourage that.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.366
Killers usually
cut the phone lines

05:32.400 --> 05:33.734
and don't wait
around for labor.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.102
There's no evidence
of foul play yet.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.670
What about a baby
down the sewer?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.138
Somebody who thought
they were helping?

05:38.171 --> 05:39.172
With friends like that...

05:39.206 --> 05:40.974
Maybe it was somebody
who found her too late.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.443
They pick up where
she left off

05:42.476 --> 05:43.744
hiding her dirty
little secret.

05:43.777 --> 05:44.978
Well, who are they
trying to kid?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.380
It's obvious
she gave birth.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.115
Well, it tracks
with having it at home.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.116
Hospitals
document newborns.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.684
She didn't want
anyone to know.

05:50.718 --> 05:51.819
Someone did.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.822
Prenatals, prescribed
by a Dr. Curtis.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.023
Brianna wasn't due

05:56.056 --> 05:56.890
for another three weeks.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.659
When was the last
time you saw her?

05:58.692 --> 06:00.160
Last Tuesday.
There was no indication

06:00.193 --> 06:01.529
she was ready to deliver.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.130
Years ago I was
involved in a shootout.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.065
My wife saw it
on the news, gave birth

06:05.098 --> 06:06.934
to our second kid
right there a month early.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.937
Extreme trauma, emotional or
physical, can trigger labor.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.839
Anybody causing
Brianna anxiety?

06:11.872 --> 06:12.940
Maybe the baby's father?

06:12.973 --> 06:14.408
She never
mentioned one.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.743
Not once
in eight months?

06:15.776 --> 06:17.945
Well, I only saw her
for the last three.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.947
Before that she went
to Manhattan Free Clinic.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.982
BENSON:
That's a big price
jump to this place.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.917
Well, you get
what you pay for.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.753
She took every
test available

06:25.786 --> 06:26.954
and spared
no expense.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.155
Any problems?

06:28.188 --> 06:29.690
Medically, no, but...

06:29.723 --> 06:30.991
I had my concerns.

06:31.024 --> 06:31.959
About?

06:31.992 --> 06:33.994
She was very detached
from the pregnancy.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.729
She didn't want
to know the sex,

06:35.763 --> 06:37.164
didn't want
to see the ultrasound,

06:37.197 --> 06:39.099
didn't even want
to hear the heartbeat.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.901
Unusual for an
expectant mother.

06:40.934 --> 06:41.735
( beeping )

06:41.769 --> 06:43.604
Oh, I've got
to take this. Excuse me.

06:43.637 --> 06:44.738
My secretary
can help you

06:44.772 --> 06:46.039
with anything
that you need.

06:46.073 --> 06:46.974
Thanks.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.510
Did not sound like
Brianna wanted this baby.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.579
Then why spend all
that money on its care?

06:51.612 --> 06:53.847
I've had four kids.
Insurance does pay

06:53.881 --> 06:55.849
for any of those
extra tests, I'll tell you.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.851
Excuse me. Brianna Morris's
payment history.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.086
Can I get a copy of that?

06:59.119 --> 07:00.788
It's in my "problem" file.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.523
Last week's payment
was declined.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.861
The credit card
is in the name

07:07.895 --> 07:09.497
of a Ron Wolcott.
Who's that?

07:09.530 --> 07:10.864
I don't know.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.900
He's never been in.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.135
Not a bad place for a guy
with credit problems.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.204
Well, maybe he gave
too much to charity

07:17.237 --> 07:19.072
helping out young,
unwed mothers.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.608
May I help you?

07:20.641 --> 07:23.076
Police. Does a Ron
Wolcott live here?

07:23.110 --> 07:26.013
Yes, that's my husband.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.014
What's this about?

07:27.047 --> 07:28.849
We think he may
be the victim

07:28.882 --> 07:29.783
of identity theft.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.085
Someone's been using
one of his credit cards.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.021
Oh, no. How much
have they charged?

07:34.054 --> 07:36.624
$20,000, to a Dr. Curtis.

07:36.657 --> 07:40.093
But... that's Brianna's OB-GYN.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.562
You know Brianna?

07:41.595 --> 07:42.763
Of course.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.198
She's carrying our baby.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.770
Why would somebody
kill our baby?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.972
STABLER:
Brianna was a surrogate?

07:52.005 --> 07:54.074
No, the baby was hers.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.075
We were adopting it.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.944
Emily Rose.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.613
We've had that name picked out
for ten years now.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.582
That's how long
we've been trying.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.216
We just couldn't
get pregnant.

08:03.250 --> 08:06.253
We tried in vitro
three times.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.955
And then you found Brianna.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.557
She was living
in a hellhole.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.793
We got her a place in
a safer neighborhood.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.227
We paid her expenses.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.263
She was doing
manual labor.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.698
It wasn't safe
for the baby.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.066
Why'd you cut off
the credit card?

08:19.099 --> 08:21.669
We didn't.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.070
One of our cards
is maxed out.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.237
I took care of it.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.009
Um, which adoption agency
did you go through?

08:29.042 --> 08:30.110
We didn't.
It was set up

08:30.143 --> 08:31.612
through a mutual friend.

08:31.645 --> 08:32.613
Who's that?

08:32.646 --> 08:34.615
Marcy Cochran.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.250
She's the wife of one
of Ron's coworkers in R&D.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.652
Where?

08:38.686 --> 08:41.121
The Flavor Institute
in Bergen.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.190
And how does this
Marcy Cochran know Brianna?

08:43.223 --> 08:44.191
Marcy does a lot

08:44.224 --> 08:45.593
of volunteer work.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.728
Brianna called
her hotline.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.300
WOMAN:
Metro Help Line.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.235
Are you having those
thoughts right now?

08:55.268 --> 08:56.637
Brianna tried
to commit suicide?

08:56.670 --> 08:59.106
No, but she was
thinking about it.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.307
Why?

09:00.340 --> 09:02.175
She'd just found out
she was pregnant.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.143
She was overwhelmed.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.278
She said she couldn't
handle her own life,

09:05.312 --> 09:07.314
let alone
the responsibility of a baby.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.215
She have any family?

09:08.248 --> 09:10.183
Father jumped ship
before she was born.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.986
Mother was abusive, dumped her
in foster care at five.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.221
She didn't want the cycle

09:14.254 --> 09:14.988
repeating itself.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.990
She ever mention
the baby's father?

09:17.024 --> 09:18.626
Yeah. She met
him in the park.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.327
He was the man
of her dreams...

09:20.360 --> 09:21.028
till the next morning.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.096
The number he gave her was fake.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.665
She never heard from him again.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.934
You get this involved
with all of your calls?

09:26.967 --> 09:29.136
We're not supposed to.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.671
This girl broke my heart.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.072
I gave her my home number.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.306
We talked every night.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.307
Convincing her

09:34.341 --> 09:35.809
to give up the baby.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.110
It was a win-win.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.646
Ron and Kelly were desperate

09:38.679 --> 09:41.281
and Brianna could not
have found better parents.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.883
When was
the last time you talked?

09:42.916 --> 09:43.884
Four days ago.

09:43.917 --> 09:44.885
And what was
going on?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.854
Whatever you are thinking,

09:46.887 --> 09:50.057
the Wolcotts would never
have hurt Brianna.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.324
Why would we think that?

09:53.727 --> 09:58.031
This is gonna sound horrible
for someone in my position.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.067
Brianna and I had a fight.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.068
About what?

10:01.101 --> 10:02.069
My idiot husband.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.071
I told him something
in confidence,

10:04.104 --> 10:06.173
and he went and
told Ron Wolcott.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.274
What'd he tell him?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.843
That Brianna
was keeping the baby.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.246
Why would the Wolcotts lie?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.848
To cover the grand
poo-bah of motives.

10:14.882 --> 10:15.849
They were ripped off.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.184
They were desperate
for this baby.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.051
She was the only light

10:18.085 --> 10:19.687
at the end
of a ten-year-long tunnel.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.321
And it just wasn't
the emotional investment.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.355
I pulled
their financials.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.924
They were stretched
pretty tight.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.392
They'd already dropped
a chunk of change

10:25.425 --> 10:26.393
trying to
get pregnant.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.261
Now they've got doctor's bills,

10:28.295 --> 10:30.297
maternity clothes, rent, food...

10:30.330 --> 10:31.932
This baby was
bought and paid for.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.133
And they're left
with squat.

10:33.166 --> 10:33.967
No baby, no refund.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.169
And no recourse.
The biological mother

10:36.203 --> 10:37.905
can change her mind at any time.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.840
BENSON:
The Wolcotts must
have been furious.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.274
They go to Brianna's apartment.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.375
They try to reason with her.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.745
Things get ugly,
maybe a shoving match.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.279
Brianna falls,
goes into labor.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.281
And, what? They deliver
the baby themselves?

10:48.315 --> 10:50.017
They give it
the old college try,

10:50.050 --> 10:50.818
but things go south.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.786
First the mother dies,
then the baby.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.788
Which goes down the sewer,
along with their dreams.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.090
That's pretty out there.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.960
Let's run this by Warner,
see if any of it floats.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.394
WARNER:
The baby exsanguinated.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.395
Bled to death?

11:02.429 --> 11:03.864
How? There
were no wounds.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.398
Through the
umbilical cord.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.234
But we saw it--
it was tied off.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.002
Not until after
the baby had lost

11:09.036 --> 11:10.237
more than half her blood.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.839
Maybe this was
an accident.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.707
The Wolcotts wanted
that baby alive.

11:13.741 --> 11:16.109
Well, someone definitely
wanted the mom dead.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.779
Perp knew how to kill her
without leaving a mark.

11:18.812 --> 11:19.947
She bled out, too?

11:19.980 --> 11:21.381
That would have
taken much longer

11:21.414 --> 11:22.415
for a full-grown adult.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.450
This woman was Burked.

11:23.483 --> 11:24.417
What the
hell is that?

11:24.451 --> 11:25.518
An arcane method

11:25.552 --> 11:28.789
of suffocation, dating back
to 19th century Scotland.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.924
Thought up by two men
selling cadavers

11:30.958 --> 11:33.393
to medical schools
who ran out of dead bodies.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.895
So they created their own?

11:34.928 --> 11:37.097
Quickest way was to sit
on the victim's chest

11:37.130 --> 11:38.498
while holding
the nose and mouth.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.333
You found petechial
hemorrhaging.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.103
Which I originally attributed
to pushing during labor,

11:43.136 --> 11:44.071
but then I found this.

11:44.104 --> 11:47.407
Compression indentation here
on the sternum.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.777
Matches the button
on her maternity dress.

11:49.810 --> 11:50.778
Perp sat on her.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.012
Any defensive wounds?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.313
Fingernail scrapings?

11:53.346 --> 11:55.482
She couldn't fight back.
She was injected

11:55.515 --> 11:58.051
with Versed, a powerful
sedative that paralyzes.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.352
But doesn't
knock you out.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.021
Brianna would have felt
everything going on

12:01.054 --> 12:02.389
but couldn't lift
a finger to resist.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.490
Wait a minute.
How can you

12:03.523 --> 12:05.292
go into labor
if you're paralyzed?

12:05.325 --> 12:07.427
Pitocin causes
the cervix to dilate.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.097
Which pregnant women
produce naturally.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.399
But I found evidence
of a synthetic form

12:12.432 --> 12:13.500
in the anal cavity.

12:13.533 --> 12:17.104
I'd say your perp incapacitated
her with the Versed

12:17.137 --> 12:20.307
and then gave her a Pitocin
suppository to induce labor.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.742
And ripped the baby
right out of her.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.185
You know, when you said
Flavor Institute,

12:32.219 --> 12:34.054
we thought you worked
in a candy store.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.188
What are you
doing here?

12:35.222 --> 12:36.924
What are you?
"CH3C

12:36.957 --> 12:38.358
OO5H11."

12:38.391 --> 12:39.359
He's a chemist.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.094
What are you cooking?

12:41.128 --> 12:43.096
Not that it's any
of your business,

12:43.130 --> 12:44.431
but isoatyl acetate.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.565
Whoa! That sounds
pretty hardcore.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.835
It's the dominant
component in
banana flavoring.

12:47.868 --> 12:48.969
What the hell
is this about?

12:49.002 --> 12:50.170
Your degree
in chemistry,

12:50.203 --> 12:51.805
and the fact
that Brianna

12:51.839 --> 12:53.340
was drugged
before her death.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.341
You can't possibly think

12:54.374 --> 12:55.876
I had anything
to do with that.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.210
You and your wife
both knew Brianna

12:57.244 --> 12:59.379
had changed her mind.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.882
Why did you lie to us?

13:01.915 --> 13:03.050
I knew, but she didn't.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.517
That's why I didn't want

13:04.551 --> 13:06.486
to say anything
in front of her.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.955
You expect us
to believe

13:07.988 --> 13:09.456
that you didn't
tell your wife

13:09.489 --> 13:11.158
that she wasn't
getting a baby?

13:11.191 --> 13:12.893
I thought I could
convince Brianna

13:12.926 --> 13:14.061
to do the right thing.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.395
By killing her?

13:15.428 --> 13:16.563
By cutting off
my credit card

13:16.596 --> 13:19.833
to show her she
couldn't possibly
support a child.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.870
STABLER:
Brianna put quite a dent
in your bank account.

13:22.903 --> 13:23.904
She owed you.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.105
You were just taking

13:25.138 --> 13:26.506
what was
rightfully yours.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.575
You really botched
it up, though.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.915
This was my daughter.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.149
I didn't do this.

13:36.183 --> 13:39.019
Brianna was having
last-minute doubts,

13:39.052 --> 13:41.054
but I knew
she'd come around.

13:41.088 --> 13:44.057
STABLER:
Not according
to your phone records.

13:44.091 --> 13:46.426
You were hounding her right up
until the day she died.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.460
Not in person.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.462
I might have
called her too much,

13:49.496 --> 13:52.065
but I certainly
didn't kill her by phone.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.971
There's
a bathroom upstairs.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.307
Luminol anywhere
he might have washed up.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.942
Why are you doing this to us?

14:01.975 --> 14:04.044
Because your husband
has a penchant
for lying.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.045
You never noticed?

14:05.078 --> 14:06.213
No. Ron is honest to a fault.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.547
Mrs. Wolcott,

14:07.580 --> 14:08.982
he swore that
you had no idea

14:09.016 --> 14:10.317
that Brianna
was keeping the baby.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.952
Now, if you did know,
he lied to us.

14:11.985 --> 14:12.953
If you didn't,

14:12.986 --> 14:14.454
he lied to you.

14:14.487 --> 14:17.891
You have no idea what
I've been through.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.492
He lied to protect me.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.994
Uh-huh.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.129
Did your husband

14:22.162 --> 14:24.031
ever bring his work home
with him?

14:24.064 --> 14:25.899
No.
No? Then what are these?

14:25.933 --> 14:27.434
I don't know.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.069
Look like pharmaceuticals to me.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.170
It's in the warrant. Bag it.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.905
Who the hell are you?

14:31.939 --> 14:33.040
That's our
new ADA.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.541
Casey Novak, Olivia Benson.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.143
Olivia, this is Casey Novak.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.644
Do I
know you?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.479
Yeah. Shortstop.
Cop's team.
Come here.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.547
Oh, right.
I didn-/////!t recognize you

14:40.580 --> 14:41.982
when you weren't
covered in my dust.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.083
That's very good.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.952
It's my case.
What are
you doing here?

14:44.985 --> 14:46.954
It's not your job.
We're the detectives.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.088
And I'm very hands-on.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.290
I like to see my cases through
from beginning to end.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.259
Well, things are being
handled just fine here.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.293
Great. Tell you what.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.327
Let me take a quick sweep,

14:54.361 --> 14:56.296
and then we can go
to the crime scene together.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.565
It's already
been processed.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.267
Not by me.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.138
STABLER:
So what microscopic
piece of evidence

15:05.172 --> 15:07.274
do you expect to find
in Brianna's apartment

15:07.307 --> 15:09.176
that the crime techs
didn't turn up?

15:09.209 --> 15:10.510
You never know.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.045
Death doesn't stop the mailman.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.981
Anyone check her box
since she died?

15:14.014 --> 15:15.282
Had it rerouted
to the station.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.617
Brianna hit the gravy train
with this couple.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.751
Why would she cut them off?

15:18.785 --> 15:21.588
Because her
maternal instincts
finally kicked in.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.123
Or she found a higher bidder.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.625
Let's look for a paper trail
to another couple.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.028
We could, but it would
be a waste of time.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.297
Why? Because I suggested it?

15:30.330 --> 15:31.431
No. Because she just checked out

15:31.464 --> 15:32.432
all these books
on child-rearing.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.466
She was keeping the baby.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.468
How do you know
when she got them?

15:35.502 --> 15:38.205
'Cause they were
checked out from the library.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.573
And I'd say,
judging from the due date,

15:40.607 --> 15:42.575
a couple of days
before her death.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.577
Skin Diseases
of the Elderly?

15:44.611 --> 15:47.480
Why would a 22-year-old
pregnant woman need this?

15:47.514 --> 15:50.183
Beats me. But
we'll be sure
to let you know

15:50.217 --> 15:51.451
as soon as we find out.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.558
FIN:
Recognize this girl?

15:58.591 --> 16:01.161
WOMAN:
Oh, of course. She'd just sit

16:01.194 --> 16:03.563
and read the periodicals
all day.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.398
So what else can
you tell us about her?

16:05.432 --> 16:07.434
She was determined
to better herself.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.436
Always checked out
self-help books.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.405
Like what? Cashing In
On Your Inner Child?

16:12.439 --> 16:14.741
Seems like you got
to know Brianna.

16:14.774 --> 16:15.975
Just from her reading list.

16:16.009 --> 16:20.147
I tried to talk about the baby,
but it was a touchy subject.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.116
Until last week.
She cleared off the baby shelf.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.417
It was the oddest thing.

16:24.451 --> 16:27.154
First, she came to the counter,
very anxious.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.322
Asked how she could
find information

16:29.356 --> 16:31.091
about someone
in her magazine.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.126
Who?
I don't know.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.462
I sent her to Josephine
in computers.

16:37.564 --> 16:38.798
JOSEPHINE:
Yeah, I remember her.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.235
The article was from a new
magazine called Good Looks.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.237
Who was it about?
A celebrity? Athlete?

16:44.271 --> 16:46.606
Dermatologist. I looked up
his bio for her.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.108
Wrote a book called...

16:48.141 --> 16:49.642
Skin Diseases
of the Elderly?

16:49.676 --> 16:51.144
That's it.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.180
Dermatologists
are MDs.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.282
Easy access to drugs
like Versed and Pitocin.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.150
And everybody goes
to medical school

16:57.184 --> 16:58.351
learns how
to deliver a baby.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.053
Dr. Archibald Newlands.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.389
She said why she
wanted information
on this guy?

17:02.422 --> 17:03.756
She didn't have to.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.558
The next thing she asked

17:05.592 --> 17:07.594
was how to file
a paternity suit.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.632
DR. NEWLANDS:
How could I be the father
of her baby?

17:12.665 --> 17:14.467
I never met her
till last week.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.802
Let me refresh
your memory.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.304
Eight months ago?

17:17.337 --> 17:18.805
No.
Maybe a quickie.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.307
She just came to you
out of the blue.

17:20.340 --> 17:21.641
No. Magazine article.

17:21.674 --> 17:22.609
Apparently, I bore

17:22.642 --> 17:25.445
a striking resemblance
to an ex-boyfriend.

17:25.478 --> 17:28.181
You two work through
this at your apartment?

17:28.215 --> 17:29.516
No. My office.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.718
I tried to tell her
she was mistaken,

17:31.751 --> 17:33.320
but she caused a scene.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.521
I had to call security.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.789
What time did you
get into work on Monday?

17:36.823 --> 17:39.492
Traffic was heavy
coming in from
my beach house.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.261
I didn't get in
till about 9:30.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.230
Yeah. Morning commute
is a bitch.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.165
Around 7:00.
What time did you leave?

17:45.198 --> 17:46.633
Can anyone vouch for that?

17:46.666 --> 17:48.168
My wife.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.336
She's also my partner--

17:49.369 --> 17:50.837
doing sclerotherapy
down the hall.

17:50.870 --> 17:51.938
You guys
commute in together?

17:51.971 --> 17:54.674
Usually. But, that day,
my wife had grand rounds.

17:54.707 --> 17:57.610
Grand rounds.
That's a nice-looking family.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.514
I can't comprehend
why someone would

18:01.548 --> 18:03.216
try to hurt them
like this.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.218
Well, it's easy enough
to clear up.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.320
Just take a paternity test.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.722
I was just about
to suggest that.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.359
So who's our daddy?

18:12.392 --> 18:14.261
Results aren't back yet.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.896
You were supposed to call
as soon as you found anything.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.366
What's this I hear?
You're onto a new suspect?

18:19.399 --> 18:21.868
We found the guy
that Brianna believed
was the father.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.370
He's not copping
to it, though.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.238
That's why you have
to come to me.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.207
I can get an order
for a paternity test.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.241
He offered it up voluntarily.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.144
It's usually a bad sign
when we get it so easily.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.312
What about the chemist?

18:32.345 --> 18:33.613
His alibi is solid.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.315
Everybody's after the flavor
of the month,

18:35.348 --> 18:37.284
so the place he works in
has hidden cameras everywhere.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.818
He got in at 6:00,
and stayed there all morning.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.254
And what about
the pharmaceuticals

18:41.288 --> 18:42.889
we found at his house?

18:42.922 --> 18:44.924
That was a sample case
a sales rep sent him.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.328
Our tech said no combination
could make Pitocin or Versed.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.862
So he really was
shielding his wife.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.198
Last call for bets

18:51.231 --> 18:52.565
on Dr. Newlands' paternity test.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.401
Just give us
the results, John.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.268
What do you want--

18:55.302 --> 18:57.337
the good news or
the bad news first?

18:57.370 --> 18:58.571
John.
He's not the father.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.473
So what's the good news?

19:00.507 --> 19:03.343
We cleared a cold case.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.215
You can't come in here.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.383
There's no need to get
a worry wrinkle, ma'am.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.651
I'm sure Dr. Newlands' wife

19:11.684 --> 19:13.253
will be happy
to finish your Botox.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.254
Why?

19:14.287 --> 19:15.255
You need to
come with us.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.323
I never touched that woman.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.590
We know. You like
them much younger.

19:17.624 --> 19:18.425
What are you talking about?

19:18.458 --> 19:20.293
We ran the sample
that you volunteered

19:20.327 --> 19:21.294
through our system.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.429
We got a hit.

19:22.462 --> 19:23.763
To what?

19:23.796 --> 19:25.765
DNA you left
in a six-year-old girl

19:25.798 --> 19:27.800
that you raped in '98.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.942
There must
be some mistake.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.310
DNA doesn't lie.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.245
Well, then you
have to know

19:38.278 --> 19:39.979
I'm not the father
of that dead girl's baby.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.281
Doesn't mean you
didn't kill her.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.249
Why on earth would I?

19:42.282 --> 19:43.950
Brianna making all
those wild accusations.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.318
That could have
ruined your practice.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.319
Broken up your family.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.354
I see what
you're doing.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.421
You can't
get me on murder,

19:48.455 --> 19:49.956
so you frame me
for this other thing.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.392
Hey, you, this other thing
is an innocent girl

19:52.425 --> 19:53.526
whose childhood you stole.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.561
I didn't.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.996
You know what her biggest
fear was before you?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.231
Starting
the first grade.

19:58.265 --> 20:00.867
She told her mom that she was
ready for big-girl clothes,

20:00.900 --> 20:02.969
so they drove out to the mall
in Paramus.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.837
Where you were
lurking in the
children's department.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.239
I've never even been to Paramus.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.407
You lured her into
that dressing room.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.375
This doesn't
make any sense.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.942
You want to know what
doesn't make any sense?

20:09.976 --> 20:11.811
That you could stop at just one.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.646
You see, it's not in
a pedophile's nature.

20:13.680 --> 20:14.647
I'm not a pedophile.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.349
Yeah, you are. You're
just a well-read one.

20:16.383 --> 20:17.884
DNA convictions start
hitting the news,

20:17.917 --> 20:19.319
you start
covering your tracks.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.653
And your johnson.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.655
But we're going
to find your
other victims.

20:22.689 --> 20:25.425
And all of
your cellmates
are going to know

20:25.458 --> 20:26.893
exactly how many
you raped.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.362
Detectives, a minute?

20:37.370 --> 20:38.705
Where's Cragen?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.373
I don't know.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.408
Then you don't interrupt me.

20:41.441 --> 20:42.942
When I'm in there with a perp,

20:42.975 --> 20:44.577
you stand here,
you watch through

20:44.611 --> 20:46.045
the one-way,
you see where we are.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.414
Where we are is
three months past

20:47.447 --> 20:48.981
the five-year
statute of limitations.

20:49.015 --> 20:49.982
We can't touch him.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.017
We know that.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.852
He's technically
not under arrest.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.521
Then why is he in there?
He's a person
of special

20:54.554 --> 20:55.822
interest in a string
of other cases.

20:55.855 --> 20:56.756
Yeah, which ones?

20:56.789 --> 20:58.491
That's what we were
trying to find out.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.792
By the book?

21:02.429 --> 21:05.332
Trust me, that guy in there
has a lot of other victims

21:05.365 --> 21:06.466
whose time hasn't run out.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.401
And we still like him
for Brianna.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.374
ADA Novak, Trevor Langan.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.843
I assume you're here
to protect your pedophile.

21:16.876 --> 21:17.844
Alleged pedophile.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.446
And Casey and I go way back.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.447
To Wall Street.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.414
Most of his clients

21:21.448 --> 21:22.749
just screw employees
out of pension plans.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.352
Well, this one
didn't screw anyone.

21:25.385 --> 21:28.455
If he's not charged,
I'll be collecting him.

21:29.989 --> 21:34.060
Detective Benson, my client has
nothing more to say to you.

21:34.093 --> 21:36.696
Not going to be
talking to him again.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.433
Did you get anything?

21:40.467 --> 21:42.068
No, thanks to you.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.473
There's got to be
other victims.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.907
We ran the M.O.
There's nothing at malls.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.542
They've got security
cameras everywhere.

21:49.576 --> 21:50.543
He knew to change it up.

21:50.577 --> 21:52.345
Smart ones change M.O.s,

21:52.379 --> 21:54.080
but no one changes signature.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.619
Look, we've both been
through Molly's file.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.921
If he had some
kind of telltale quirk...

22:01.954 --> 22:03.623
they didn't get
it out of her.

22:03.656 --> 22:04.457
She's older now.

22:04.491 --> 22:07.360
Maybe there's something
she remembers.

22:13.533 --> 22:16.969
I don't know, I was a kid then.
It was a long time ago.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.439
Molly, we found
the man that did it.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.574
Good. I hope
they kill him in jail.

22:21.608 --> 22:24.043
Actually, he's not
in jail yet.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.044
Why not?

22:25.077 --> 22:29.582
The law lets us pursue
someone for only so long.

22:29.616 --> 22:32.985
We caught this guy
a little too late.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.021
You guys suck.

22:35.054 --> 22:37.056
I hate to do this to her.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.525
It's for her.

22:38.558 --> 22:41.528
Molly, I know it seems like
everyone let you down,

22:41.561 --> 22:43.563
but we want
to make it right.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.598
Well, you can't.

22:45.632 --> 22:48.067
We think that he's hurting
other little girls.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.135
So go bother them.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.169
We need your help

22:50.202 --> 22:52.071
to figure out who they are.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.473
How would I know?

22:53.506 --> 22:54.974
Maybe there
was something...

22:56.976 --> 23:00.547
that he did with you that could
link him to the others.

23:00.580 --> 23:04.584
Then we could
put him away.

23:04.617 --> 23:05.818
Like what?

23:05.852 --> 23:07.520
You know, it
could be anything.

23:07.554 --> 23:10.723
Something small that at the time
you didn't even realize

23:10.757 --> 23:12.659
meant anything.

23:12.692 --> 23:13.426
A smell...

23:13.460 --> 23:17.530
a phrase that
he kept repeating...

23:17.564 --> 23:19.566
Molly...

23:20.933 --> 23:24.671
or maybe something
too embarrassing to tell, huh?

23:37.850 --> 23:41.488
( sobbing )

23:43.556 --> 23:45.592
It's okay, honey.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.960
( sobbing continues )

23:47.994 --> 23:49.462
It's okay.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.168
He tells her they're
giving away free candy.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.538
She follows him into
a back dressing room.

23:58.571 --> 23:59.639
Where was Mom?

23:59.672 --> 24:00.439
Ten feet away,

24:00.473 --> 24:01.841
digging through
the sales rack.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.643
He locks the door,
exposes himself,

24:03.676 --> 24:05.578
squirts honey on it,
tells her to lick it.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.046
He carries a bottle
of honey around?

24:07.079 --> 24:08.047
Packets.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.649
Probably got it at
the food court.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.183
He tells her that
she's going to like it,

24:11.217 --> 24:12.885
that it's sweet,
tastes like a lollipop.

24:12.919 --> 24:13.820
She doesn't want to,

24:13.853 --> 24:15.722
but he won't open the door
till she does it.

24:15.755 --> 24:16.723
She's six and scared.

24:16.756 --> 24:17.857
One lick flips
his switch.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.125
He rapes her.

24:19.158 --> 24:22.629
We've been going through
the tri-state 61s,
looking for a match.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.631
I got one. Alicia Hahn,
eight years old.

24:24.664 --> 24:25.632
Happened at the Bronx Zoo.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.834
Lured into a bathroom.
Same packet of honey.

24:27.867 --> 24:28.835
CRAGEN:
When?

24:28.868 --> 24:29.836
Two months ago.

24:29.869 --> 24:32.071
Bring Newlands in
for a lineup.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.072
You can't do that.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.073
Why?

24:34.106 --> 24:35.174
The victim is
eight years old.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.275
And she deserves justice.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.944
STABLER:
And if she picks
the wrong guy,

24:37.977 --> 24:39.612
you've just given him
exculpatory evidence.

24:39.646 --> 24:40.913
Which is admissible at trial.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.281
I'm willing to take that chance.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.215
CRAGEN:
Lineup is a bad idea.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.685
Adults have enough
trouble making an I.D.

24:45.718 --> 24:46.919
It's way too risky
with a kid.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.555
It happened two months ago.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.189
How could she possibly
forget him?

25:00.299 --> 25:01.634
I don't know.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.803
LANGAN:
Good enough for me.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.905
Take your time, Alicia.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.974
This is very important.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.842
Yeah, she knows that.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.011
Do you need
to stop now?

25:12.044 --> 25:13.746
Please, just one more look.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.615
And this time really
concentrate.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.650
I was.

25:18.951 --> 25:21.821
LANGAN:
She can't see what's not there.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.661
NOVAK:
Do you see him?

25:37.103 --> 25:38.871
Is it number...

25:38.905 --> 25:41.240
is it number...

25:43.275 --> 25:44.744
two?

25:46.946 --> 25:50.082
Excuse me,
I have a motion to file.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.083
Was I wrong?

25:51.117 --> 25:53.185
You did just great, Alicia.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.655
I'm going to take you
home now, okay, honey?

25:55.688 --> 25:57.089
Come on. It's okay.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.557
I'm sorry.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.843
Could you have been
any tougher on
that little girl?

26:16.876 --> 26:19.145
Like she hasn't already
been traumatized enough.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.782
I'm sorry.

26:28.387 --> 26:31.157
Nobody thinks that they
can do this at first.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.192
I wanted straight homicides.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.362
You know, all the glory,
no living victims.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.865
Lesson number one,

26:38.898 --> 26:42.869
nobody can handle the children.

26:42.902 --> 26:44.103
How do you?

26:44.136 --> 26:46.706
Well, I'm not going
to lie to you.

26:46.739 --> 26:48.074
It doesn't get easier.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.810
All this sickness
and perversion.

26:50.843 --> 26:53.813
I mean, what do you say
to your boyfriend

26:53.846 --> 26:55.915
when you go home at night?

26:55.948 --> 26:57.984
I don't actually have one.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.686
Because of the job?

26:59.719 --> 27:00.653
Well, I try to date.

27:00.687 --> 27:03.756
Things go great until
they ask what I do.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.224
It's not exactly

27:05.257 --> 27:07.126
dinner conversation, huh?

27:07.159 --> 27:08.861
The ones that don't
pull away immediately

27:08.895 --> 27:10.797
lean in, way too interested,

27:10.830 --> 27:13.265
wanting to hear all the
sick, twisted details.

27:13.299 --> 27:19.271
And, um, either way,
it's always the last date.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.274
It must be easier
for the male detectives.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.743
Well, let's see...

27:23.776 --> 27:26.879
Fin never talks about
his love life at work,

27:26.913 --> 27:30.116
and Elliot doesn't talk
about work at home, and...

27:30.149 --> 27:32.785
and Munch has just given up.

27:32.819 --> 27:37.089
Then why do you guys do it?

27:37.123 --> 27:39.158
Because somebody has to.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.740
Did you ever taken your girls
to the Bronx Zoo, Mrs. Newlands?

27:53.773 --> 27:54.506
A few times.

27:54.540 --> 27:56.108
Lynnette is obsessed
with giraffes.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.945
NOVAK:
A lot of kids are.

27:58.978 --> 28:02.915
Your husband must have
really enjoyed himself.

28:02.949 --> 28:06.118
That's not funny.

28:06.152 --> 28:09.088
He told me all about these
ridiculous new allegations.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.190
They're not allegations,
they're fact.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.391
We've been married
15 years.

28:12.424 --> 28:15.461
I think I would have picked up
on something like that by now.

28:15.494 --> 28:17.329
If you haven't,
you're in serious denial,

28:17.363 --> 28:19.799
which is frightening,
given your daughter's ages.

28:19.832 --> 28:20.699
That is sick.

28:20.733 --> 28:24.336
He has never been
inappropriate with them.

28:24.370 --> 28:27.940
What about with
their friends?

28:27.974 --> 28:29.308
I think you should go now.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.243
Listen to me,
there's no question

28:31.277 --> 28:33.212
that your husband
is a pedophile.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.380
He stood in a lineup.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.849
What more do we have to do
to convince you?

28:36.883 --> 28:39.085
DNA evidence is irrefutable,
Doctor.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.420
We have his in
one of the victims.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.391
He never told me that.

28:45.424 --> 28:46.959
Who are you?

28:46.993 --> 28:49.128
Casey Novak, assistant
district attorney.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.930
What the hell
are you doing here?

28:52.999 --> 28:55.434
Please... if you've been
covering up for him,

28:55.467 --> 28:56.769
tell me now.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.270
Get out.

29:00.172 --> 29:03.409
Think of your little girls.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.077
I'm calling my attorney.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.353
She has nothing linking
my client to this crime.

29:14.386 --> 29:16.022
I have a particularly
vile and unique M.O.

29:16.055 --> 29:17.156
She has no DNA,
no witnesses,

29:17.189 --> 29:18.490
and the victim looked
right at him,

29:18.524 --> 29:20.226
but picked a different man
from the lineup.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.829
This was a scared little girl
who blocked out her assailants.

29:22.862 --> 29:23.930
Remember, she'd been brutalized.

29:23.963 --> 29:26.098
According to her, by suspect
number two, not my client.

29:26.132 --> 29:27.199
That's such bull.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.935
Maybe, but you
haven't established

29:28.968 --> 29:29.936
a prima facie case,
Counselor.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.338
If you've got something,
time to show your cards.

29:32.371 --> 29:33.339
I have a prior victim.

29:33.372 --> 29:35.975
Same approximate age,
same packet of honey,

29:36.008 --> 29:37.576
and I do have his DNA
in this one.

29:37.609 --> 29:38.577
Which is inadmissible.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.379
The clock ran out on that case
three months ago.

29:40.412 --> 29:41.747
Molineaux.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.283
Her testimony would be
introduced solely
to establish pattern.

29:44.316 --> 29:45.985
Your Honor, if you let that in,
it's all over.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.420
The jury will convict based
on the prior bad act alone.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.288
I'll have to agree.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.157
The physical evidence is
too dispositive.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.224
Your Honor...

29:52.258 --> 29:53.192
Let's split
the difference.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.928
DNA is out,
but I'll allow you to argue M.O.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.037
...you have him
call me.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.175
Thank you.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.844
Right.
I got to go.

30:11.878 --> 30:14.881
Your Honor,
the People are ready.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.316
Where's your client, Mr. Langan?

30:17.349 --> 30:19.986
I just put in a call
to his wife,

30:20.019 --> 30:23.255
and my assistant is checking
local hospitals.

30:23.289 --> 30:24.323
Oh, please.

30:24.356 --> 30:25.958
He hasn't been in an accident.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.059
He's obviously fled.

30:27.093 --> 30:28.394
If you have any
knowledge

30:28.427 --> 30:31.063
of your client's
whereabouts,
Counselor...

30:31.097 --> 30:31.998
I don't.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.400
But if I could just have
a short recess...

30:34.433 --> 30:35.367
Bail is forfeited.

30:35.401 --> 30:38.004
I'm ordering a bench warrant
for his arrest.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.540
( clearing throat )

30:41.573 --> 30:43.976
Let's hope he didn't
flee the country.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.312
I'll get started
on freezing his accounts.

30:47.646 --> 30:51.117
Check out Langan.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.953
He just got
a phone call.

30:53.986 --> 30:56.055
I'd rather check
his caller I.D.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.092
Anyone we know?

31:04.330 --> 31:06.332
Where?

31:08.100 --> 31:10.002
Where can I meet you?

31:15.307 --> 31:17.609
You know, it wouldn't
take much to swank
this place up.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.678
You ever think of investing
in a restaurant-bar?

31:19.711 --> 31:20.679
With your track record? No way.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.049
I heard about that dive
of yours in Baltimore.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.184
I'd stay away from the food
and beverage industry,

31:25.217 --> 31:27.219
but if you're looking for
a good tax shelter...

31:27.253 --> 31:30.022
Could you make it
any more obvious that
you're talking to us?

31:31.690 --> 31:34.093
He was supposed to be here
20 minutes ago.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.361
I don't have all day.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.263
Maybe you tipped him off
already.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.231
Why would I do that?

31:39.265 --> 31:41.067
Eyes forward, bottom feeder.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.434
I don't need this.

31:42.468 --> 31:45.471
So help me,
if you're playing us...

31:47.206 --> 31:48.507
STABLER:
So, what are we thinking?

31:48.540 --> 31:49.575
Newlands must have made us.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.143
How? He's never
seen you or Munch.

31:51.177 --> 31:52.178
( phone ringing )

31:52.211 --> 31:53.079
Langan's scum.

31:53.112 --> 31:55.081
Could've signaled him
over the phone.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.248
Stabler.

31:56.282 --> 31:59.685
Where is he?

31:59.718 --> 32:01.687
Saved the taxpayers
a pile of money.

32:01.720 --> 32:02.955
Suicide?

32:02.989 --> 32:04.056
I doubt it.

32:04.090 --> 32:05.224
No sign of the gun.

32:12.231 --> 32:15.034
Kind of hard to shoot yourself
in the back of the head.

32:15.067 --> 32:17.703
Executed.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.571
A little ahead of schedule.

32:26.112 --> 32:27.413
Where were Newlands'
wife and kids?

32:27.446 --> 32:28.614
They moved out
the day that Novak

32:28.647 --> 32:29.548
made her little
house call.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.417
Well, that must have
been a tense situation.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.651
Wasn't his wife also his partner

32:32.684 --> 32:34.186
in the dermatology
practice?

32:34.220 --> 32:35.421
Yup-- he destroys
her home life,

32:35.454 --> 32:36.755
jeopardizes her livelihood.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.723
Double motive.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.491
She was at the office at
the time of his death.

32:39.525 --> 32:40.492
Could have
hired someone.

32:40.526 --> 32:41.493
Easier lead
to follow

32:41.527 --> 32:43.062
than the painfully obvious one.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.096
BENSON:
Family member

32:44.130 --> 32:45.097
of one of his victims.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.365
Well, I don't
want to make

32:46.398 --> 32:49.335
these people relive what that
sick bastard did to their kids.

32:49.368 --> 32:51.070
( phone ringing )

32:51.103 --> 32:52.404
Cragen.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.973
They're standing right here.

32:58.544 --> 33:01.147
That's impossible.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.282
They're on their way.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.385
MUNCH:
Six-year-old girl
went missing

33:06.418 --> 33:07.386
around 9:00
this morning.

33:07.419 --> 33:08.387
Courtney Jones.

33:08.420 --> 33:09.188
Her mother
had to be sedated.

33:09.221 --> 33:10.522
Newlands got killed
around 9:00.

33:10.556 --> 33:11.490
Couldn't
have been him.

33:11.523 --> 33:12.691
Newlands lives a couple
blocks from here.

33:12.724 --> 33:14.060
Could've grabbed her
just before.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.627
Snatching girls wasn't
part of his M.O.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.096
FIN:
That's definitely
his signature.

33:17.129 --> 33:18.164
What's that?

33:18.197 --> 33:20.099
A stirrer that dispenses honey.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.367
You find them
in your upper-end cafes.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.102
Yeah, well, I found it
in the trash,

33:23.135 --> 33:24.136
over here by this bench.

33:24.170 --> 33:25.804
BENSON:
Could've been anybody
sipping tea.

33:25.837 --> 33:26.905
FIN:
We interviewed
all the mothers

33:26.938 --> 33:29.241
and a couple of them put
a man sitting right here.

33:29.275 --> 33:30.609
Caucasian, late thirties...

33:30.642 --> 33:31.610
No tea.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.145
Well, he didn't
attack her here,

33:33.179 --> 33:34.146
there's no privacy.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.147
And what's with the honey?

33:35.181 --> 33:36.115
Excitement.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.316
That straw
was sucked dry.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.750
The taste alone was
enough to trigger

33:38.784 --> 33:40.119
his sense-memory
of past assaults.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.353
Let's send this thing
to the lab,

33:41.387 --> 33:43.122
see if the saliva
matches Newlands' DNA.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.124
Well, is there any chance
the girl's still alive?

33:45.157 --> 33:46.625
BENSON:
Well, we've been
through his apartment,

33:46.658 --> 33:48.160
he didn't take her there.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.195
HUANG:
He wouldn't have.

33:49.228 --> 33:49.995
It's too risky.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.630
He was facing a long
prison sentence.

33:51.663 --> 33:52.464
This was his last hurrah.

33:52.498 --> 33:54.200
BENSON:
Maybe something
on him

33:54.233 --> 33:55.534
will tell us where he took her.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.636
Warner should be starting
the autopsy now.

34:00.206 --> 34:01.340
What are you doing?

34:01.373 --> 34:02.808
Digging...

34:02.841 --> 34:05.311
for treasure.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.151
What's that?

34:12.184 --> 34:13.352
Some kind of tube.

34:13.385 --> 34:14.853
What for?

34:14.886 --> 34:16.155
I have no idea.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.190
There's blood in it.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.628
Well, how'd it get in there?

34:24.296 --> 34:26.232
He's a doctor,
maybe he did it himself.

34:26.265 --> 34:27.399
How?

34:27.433 --> 34:29.401
He could have given
himself a local,

34:29.435 --> 34:32.238
inserted the tube and
stitched himself back up.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.740
Why would you do that?

34:34.773 --> 34:37.176
To beat a paternity test.

34:37.209 --> 34:39.511
BENSON:
Son of
a bitch.

34:39.545 --> 34:41.347
Newlands was the father
of Brianna's baby.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.215
He put somebody else's blood
in that tube.

34:43.249 --> 34:44.049
STABLER:
Hold on a minute.

34:44.082 --> 34:45.651
Hold on.
You have professional people

34:45.684 --> 34:48.254
taking blood out of his arm,
wouldn't they notice that?

34:48.287 --> 34:50.356
You only have to roll
your sleeve up to the elbow.

34:50.389 --> 34:52.324
Scar would've
been hidden.

34:52.358 --> 34:53.525
I thought I'd seen everything.

34:53.559 --> 34:54.426
BENSON:
This puts him

34:54.460 --> 34:55.761
back on killing
Brianna and that baby.

34:55.794 --> 34:57.196
STABLER:
If that's
not his blood,

34:57.229 --> 34:58.497
he didn't rape Molly Stratton.

34:58.530 --> 34:59.498
HUANG:
No.

34:59.531 --> 35:00.766
Who's ever blood he stole did.

35:00.799 --> 35:01.733
BENSON:
And that's the guy

35:01.767 --> 35:04.102
who's still out there,
with Courtney Jones.

35:06.372 --> 35:08.374
So in order to beat
a murder rap,

35:08.407 --> 35:10.209
Newlands used
someone else's blood.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.144
Just happens to be
our pedophile's.

35:12.178 --> 35:14.780
The Honey Rapist reads about
the trial, whacks him.

35:14.813 --> 35:17.249
Newlands must have known
the rapist's real identity.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.351
He could have turned
him in at any time.

35:19.385 --> 35:20.186
Why didn't he?

35:20.219 --> 35:22.188
If Newlands
turns in his own blood

35:22.221 --> 35:23.889
to clear himself
of child molestation,

35:23.922 --> 35:25.357
we get him on double homicide.

35:25.391 --> 35:26.225
Either way,
he was screwed.

35:26.258 --> 35:27.693
He knew he didn't
rape those girls,

35:27.726 --> 35:29.395
he just couldn't figure
out a way to prove it.

35:29.428 --> 35:30.796
Okay, the first day
of the trial,

35:30.829 --> 35:32.264
he panics,
he doesn't show.

35:32.298 --> 35:34.166
He calls his lawyer
to tell him the truth.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.434
Unfortunately,
dead men don't talk.

35:35.467 --> 35:38.270
So how are we going
to find the Honey Rapist?

35:38.304 --> 35:40.406
Well, one thing
we know for sure,

35:40.439 --> 35:42.308
Newlands
had access to his blood.

35:42.341 --> 35:43.742
It's one of his patients.

35:43.775 --> 35:45.377
HUANG:
Who's experiencing

35:45.411 --> 35:46.478
a new-found sense of freedom

35:46.512 --> 35:48.280
now that everyone
thinks he's dead,

35:48.314 --> 35:49.381
and he grabs another girl.

35:49.415 --> 35:51.383
But he can't lay off the honey.

35:51.417 --> 35:52.484
It's
a compulsion.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.320
He didn't use it
in his usual way.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.422
He never dreamed
we'd make the connection.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.823
He doesn't know we have.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.425
If he's going to keep up
this charade,

35:59.458 --> 36:01.193
he's going
to have to kill this girl.

36:01.227 --> 36:03.795
We've got to subpoena
Newlands' patient list.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.864
Let's see if the widow
can save us some time.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.234
I don't know where to start.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.501
25% of our patients are male.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.937
But how many have
blood work done?

36:11.970 --> 36:13.539
Not the
dermabrasions,

36:13.572 --> 36:16.442
acne treatments...
resurfacing...

36:16.475 --> 36:18.244
None of these.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.414
I lied for him.

36:22.448 --> 36:24.283
The day he killed her,

36:24.316 --> 36:26.718
he was already gone
when I woke up.

36:26.752 --> 36:28.354
Ma'am, it's got to be
one of his patients,

36:28.387 --> 36:29.721
and we really need
that name.

36:29.755 --> 36:31.490
He probably
took the blood sample

36:31.523 --> 36:33.459
the same day he put
the tube in.

36:33.492 --> 36:36.462
He told me he cut himself.

36:36.495 --> 36:39.731
I remember exactly
when that happened.

36:39.765 --> 36:44.236
It was our daughter's birthday--
the 18th.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.804
STABLER:
That's right after
Brianna

36:45.837 --> 36:48.006
first contacted him.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.375
Nothing.

36:49.408 --> 36:50.342
I know that was the day.

36:50.376 --> 36:51.477
What about your patients?

36:51.510 --> 36:53.279
Did you take any blood that day?

37:01.353 --> 37:03.355
Just when I thought that bastard
had screwed me over

37:03.389 --> 37:04.756
every way
possible...

37:04.790 --> 37:05.824
Who is he?

37:05.857 --> 37:07.526
Peter Nestler.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.495
Botox and collagen.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.497
He's in his 30's, but panics
whenever he sees a wrinkle.

37:11.530 --> 37:12.498
STABLER:
Okay,

37:12.531 --> 37:13.665
why do you think it's him?

37:13.699 --> 37:14.700
He had a small
melanoma

37:14.733 --> 37:15.734
on his back.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.404
I did a workup to make sure
it hadn't spread.

37:18.437 --> 37:21.340
He's the only one
I took blood from that week.

37:21.373 --> 37:22.908
STABLER:
Police!

37:22.941 --> 37:24.510
BENSON:
Nestler?!

37:26.345 --> 37:27.546
OFFICER:
Bathroom's
clear.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.516
OFFICER 2:
Clear over here.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.485
Kitchen's clear!

37:33.519 --> 37:34.820
BENSON:
Here, too.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.388
He's definitely our guy.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.390
Sick freak.

37:38.424 --> 37:41.427
NOVAK:
Any sign of
Courtney Jones?

37:41.460 --> 37:42.428
What are you
doing here?

37:42.461 --> 37:43.862
Search warrant.
No, really.

37:43.895 --> 37:44.730
You here to supervise us?

37:44.763 --> 37:46.632
I'm not here to make
sure you can do it,

37:46.665 --> 37:48.800
I'm here to see if I can.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.736
BENSON:
Kiddie porn.

37:50.769 --> 37:51.603
Closet's full...

37:51.637 --> 37:53.739
NOVAK:
That doesn't tell us
where he is.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.608
What is she
doing here?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.911
He's a fisherman.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.613
Plugs, poppers...

38:01.647 --> 38:04.450
reel's loaded
with 50-pound test.

38:04.483 --> 38:05.784
That's rust.

38:05.817 --> 38:07.353
He fishes saltwater.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.321
He's got a boat-- Honey Do.

38:09.355 --> 38:11.523
"Peter Nestler, on his
boat the Honey Do,

38:11.557 --> 38:13.325
caught a 40-pound striper."

38:13.359 --> 38:14.326
STABLER:
Where?

38:14.360 --> 38:15.394
City Island.

38:15.427 --> 38:16.662
Looks like he's got
a slip there.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.807
There's his boat.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.642
You stay here.

38:33.512 --> 38:34.580
Elliot...

38:34.613 --> 38:35.814
half way down.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.349
Got him.

38:41.620 --> 38:42.688
Yo, Nestler.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.122
Don't move.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.557
Police!

38:54.633 --> 38:55.967
I'll take the boat.

39:02.608 --> 39:03.909
Where is she?

39:03.942 --> 39:05.544
The girl,
where is she?!

39:05.577 --> 39:07.746
( stammering )

39:07.779 --> 39:10.582
Next time you go down
you're not coming back up.

39:10.616 --> 39:13.885
Help me!
Somebody, help!

39:20.626 --> 39:21.660
Courtney.

39:23.495 --> 39:24.630
Elliot!

39:27.499 --> 39:28.900
Elliot,
Casey's got her.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.368
She was in the cooler.
Come on.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.907
She okay?

39:35.941 --> 39:37.375
She's alive.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.749
Okay.

39:56.695 --> 39:58.163
( knocking )

39:58.196 --> 39:59.865
Got a minute?

39:59.898 --> 40:02.601
When you rescue
a little girl, you get two.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.536
Have a seat.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.505
I can't do it.

40:06.538 --> 40:07.506
Sure you can.

40:07.539 --> 40:08.540
Just bend your knees,

40:08.574 --> 40:10.542
and let gravity take over.

40:13.545 --> 40:16.047
That's not
what I'm talking about.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.649
I know.

40:17.683 --> 40:20.018
I want out.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.687
Why...

40:21.720 --> 40:24.523
when you've got a slam dunk
in your very first case?

40:27.993 --> 40:33.599
I can't let go of what
that little girl went through.

40:36.134 --> 40:39.605
I was watching you for this job
when you were in white collar.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.507
Knew you were tough,

40:41.540 --> 40:43.208
but weren't sure you were
the right person.

40:43.241 --> 40:45.611
I'm not.

40:45.644 --> 40:48.213
The fact that it
affects you like this

40:48.246 --> 40:50.048
tells me my first instincts
were right.

40:50.081 --> 40:52.050
What are you
talking about?

40:52.083 --> 40:56.588
This case was the ultimate test.

40:56.622 --> 40:59.825
And you passed
with flying colors.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.793
But I don't want it.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.596
You will.
