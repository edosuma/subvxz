And a doctor!
Talk about a catch!

19:23.530 --> 19:24.997
Look at this.
This is so ridiculous.

I know. I hate it.

Ha! I knew you would
come back eventually.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.142
To my own home?

19:36.175 --> 19:37.344
You caught me.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.011
Do you know how
dangerous it is

19:39.045 --> 19:41.013
to stop sitting
the month early?

19:41.047 --> 19:42.682
You won't heal properly.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.651
Now we need to start
all over again.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.653
We do, actually.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.854
Only this time,

19:47.887 --> 19:51.491
how about you take a seat
and I make the tea, okay?

19:54.627 --> 19:57.597
So, I talked to Jenny.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.667
I think I know why
you're doing this.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.503
Because you're broken
and I'm helping you heal.

20:03.536 --> 20:07.173
No.
Because you need to heal.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.954
But when you do,
I'm here.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.872
This is sangria.

We're just trying to find
our optimal workout hair.

Although, now that
we look so good,

21:13.640 --> 21:16.976
it seems like kind of a waste to
ruin this hair by working out.
