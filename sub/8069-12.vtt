00:54.155 --> 00:56.957
You don't own the
world, butt face.

00:56.990 --> 00:57.858
It's my room, too.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.160
Just wait till Mom gets home.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.594
BECKY: I'm trembling, Darlene!

01:00.628 --> 01:02.496
Hey!

01:02.530 --> 01:04.998
Well, if you're going to
kick me out of my own room,

01:05.032 --> 01:06.800
at least give me my
sweatshirt and sneaker.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.102
Here!

01:08.136 --> 01:09.603
And my basketball.

01:09.637 --> 01:10.604
Here!

01:10.638 --> 01:11.605
Quit yelling.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.575
I'm watching Geraldo.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.076
You shut up.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.578
Ow!

01:17.611 --> 01:19.913
You're such a baby.

01:19.947 --> 01:22.750
Dad, you're home!

01:22.783 --> 01:27.521
Yeah, so are you!

01:27.555 --> 01:29.990
Dad, Darlene threw
a sneaker at me.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.625
Darlene, what's
the matter with you?

01:31.659 --> 01:33.127
I know.
I missed him.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.495
I shouldn't have
rushed the throw.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.901
And look at this mess.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.304
You better get that picked
up before mom gets home.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.638
Where am I going to put it?

01:44.672 --> 01:45.706
I can't get in my room.

01:45.739 --> 01:46.774
Why not?

01:46.807 --> 01:48.809
The queen of the
universe locked me out.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.011
Becky, open that door.

01:51.044 --> 01:54.748
And before she locked me out,
she pushed me out of the room.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.318
I mean, if I wasn't so
athletically gifted,

01:57.351 --> 01:59.687
I might have fallen
down the stairs.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.854
Hi, Dad.
Bye, Dad.

02:00.888 --> 02:01.989
- Where you going?
- Out.

02:02.022 --> 02:04.592
Hey, you be home
in time for supper.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.460
I thought she was grounded.

02:09.263 --> 02:12.099
Darlene, now you
got your room back.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.467
Now clean this stuff up.

02:13.501 --> 02:14.368
Hi, babe.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.269
How was your day?

02:15.303 --> 02:16.537
Great.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.139
Some kid called me sir.

02:19.173 --> 02:22.410
I told my boss, I'm not
wearing that hat again.

02:22.443 --> 02:25.012
Darlene, will you help
me set the table, please?

02:25.045 --> 02:26.247
It's not my night.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.115
It's Becky's night.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.617
Shall I call her?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.519
Yeah, get her down here.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.453
Becky!

02:36.457 --> 02:38.259
Oh, that's right.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.893
She's out.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.362
What do you mean she's out?

02:41.395 --> 02:43.130
As in not home?

02:43.163 --> 02:47.000
Derived from the English
words "at the mall."

02:47.034 --> 02:48.769
I told her to
be home by supper.

02:48.802 --> 02:49.903
You let her go?

02:49.937 --> 02:50.871
She's grounded, Dan.

02:50.904 --> 02:51.839
She is?

02:51.872 --> 02:52.773
Yeah.

02:52.806 --> 02:55.409
Well, I guess
I've been naughty.

03:00.113 --> 03:02.015
It's not funny.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.584
No kidding.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.885
She locked me out of my room.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.187
Well, she is only human.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.490
And practically threw
me down the stairs.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.993
See, that's why she's grounded
'cause she's acting awful,

03:13.026 --> 03:14.962
and her attitude stinks.

03:14.995 --> 03:18.432
Plus she's not even
here to set the table,

03:18.466 --> 03:22.135
and it is her night
But I'd be happy to do

03:22.169 --> 03:25.339
it because hey, whatever's good
for my family is good for me.

03:25.373 --> 03:28.242
Set the table, Darlene.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.243
Suck up.

03:29.277 --> 03:32.646
[music playing]

03:32.680 --> 03:35.215
It's 20 to 7:00, Dan.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.216
Uh-huh.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.752
Say, is there any
of that um, bread?

03:38.786 --> 03:39.987
Yes, there is.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.755
Is that your subtle
way of asking

03:41.789 --> 03:42.923
me to bring you the bread?

03:42.956 --> 03:43.824
Sorry, babe.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.959
Didn't mean to be subtle.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.228
Mom, you have any milk?

03:48.262 --> 03:50.664
Not anymore, but there's
some in the fridge.

03:50.698 --> 03:53.634
Nice, Elsie.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.970
Why, if it isn't
Beckie Conner,

03:57.004 --> 03:59.239
long lost daughter of
Dan Roseanne Conner.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.140
Uh-huh.

04:00.173 --> 04:03.544
So kind of you to join us.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.479
Is this supposed to be dinner?

04:05.513 --> 04:07.915
No, this is the cocktail
hour before dinner.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.851
These beans are
totally lifeless, Mother.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.853
If you'd steam them
instead of boiling them,

04:12.886 --> 04:14.455
they might be edible.
- Is there a problem?

04:14.488 --> 04:15.456
No.

04:15.489 --> 04:16.690
Where were you, Beckie?

04:16.724 --> 04:18.426
Hanging out.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.360
Chicken.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.728
Coming at you.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.096
Well, you weren't
hanging out here,

04:23.130 --> 04:24.298
which is where
you're supposed to be

04:24.332 --> 04:26.700
hanging out 'cause you're
grounded, remember?

04:26.734 --> 04:28.268
Let's see what she'll
come up with now.

04:28.302 --> 04:31.472
Ha ha ha.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.906
I forgot, OK?

04:32.940 --> 04:33.974
I'm sorry.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.577
Hey, how about losing
the attitude, huh?

04:36.610 --> 04:39.747
Now I asked you where you
were, and I want an answer.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.948
Mom's waiting, Rebecca.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.887
Butt out, Darlene.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.055
Any answer.

04:48.088 --> 04:48.956
Come on.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.858
Lie to me.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.793
Do you have to know where I
am every moment of my life?

04:52.826 --> 04:53.627
Yes.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.501
I was at the mall, OK?

05:00.534 --> 05:03.203
I got off the bus, walked
directly into Rodbell's, where

05:03.236 --> 05:04.938
I met Diane and Sammy.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.741
We three stood near the
entrance to the theaters, goofed

05:07.775 --> 05:11.311
on some mall cop named
Ronaldo, split some fries,

05:11.345 --> 05:13.481
and came home.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.848
Is that specific enough?

05:18.819 --> 05:20.087
Who paid for the fries?

05:23.891 --> 05:26.293
Now watch me be specific.

05:26.326 --> 05:30.030
Thanks to that nasty,
snotty attitude of yours,

05:30.063 --> 05:32.666
you get to spend
another seven fun-filled

05:32.700 --> 05:37.237
days and nights on the second
floor of 714 Delaware Street.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.472
Yes.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.608
You are not going to
ground me for another week.

05:40.641 --> 05:41.642
You want to push it for two?

05:41.675 --> 05:42.843
You're so weak.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.478
Hey, I don't know what's
gotten into you lately,

05:44.512 --> 05:45.579
you lady.
- Hey, I don't want to hear it.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.247
Hey!
You apologize to your mother.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.916
You're being
totally unfair, too,

05:48.949 --> 05:50.518
because I don't want to
eat your stinking beans!

05:50.551 --> 05:51.719
Beans
- Wrong.

05:51.752 --> 05:54.722
I am being totally unfair
because that is my job.

05:54.755 --> 05:57.024
Now you stil down and have a
nice dinner with your family.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.560
I hate you.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.029
I say disown her.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.965
[music playing]

06:09.369 --> 06:12.039
Hey, geeky why are
you in such a mood?

06:12.072 --> 06:13.874
You wouldn't understand.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.109
Yeah, well, it's getting old.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.310
Darlene, who asked you?

06:17.344 --> 06:18.746
No one asked me.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.814
I'm telling you.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.884
You're really hurting
Mom's feelings, Becky.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.185
Next time you sound
off on her, I'm

06:25.218 --> 06:26.987
going to punch your face in.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.422
Whatever.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.190
Come on, Pudge.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.726
I'll hit you three times
before you even touch me.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.627
Go to bed.

06:33.661 --> 06:36.396
I don't want to go to bed.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.098
Darlene, give
me back my covers.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.166
What covers?

06:39.199 --> 06:40.200
Ow.
Ow.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.034
Ow.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.706
You really think Mom's upset?

06:45.739 --> 06:47.174
You know she is.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.075
Good.

06:48.108 --> 06:48.976
She deserves it.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.979
For what, butt nose?

06:52.012 --> 06:55.048
For treating me all the
time like a little kid.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.550
I mean, she treats
me like I'm your age.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.752
Yeah, but at least
she lets me go out.

06:58.786 --> 07:02.355
Yeah, but you always have
to tell her where you're going

07:02.389 --> 07:03.423
and what time you'll be back.

07:03.457 --> 07:04.658
I mean, don't you
ever get sick of that?

07:04.692 --> 07:07.194
That's why you're
being so mean?

07:07.227 --> 07:10.531
I'm just tired of her
running my life for me.

07:10.564 --> 07:13.834
[music playing]

07:17.805 --> 07:20.908
Darlene, I'm packing
a turkey with no mayo

07:20.941 --> 07:24.878
exactly as requested, and
I expect you to eat it.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.580
Beckie, we got bacon here.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.516
I always eat my lunch.

07:28.549 --> 07:31.451
I do everything my mommy says.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.420
I need snack money.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.356
Oh yeah, I need money
for a new bus card.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.425
How about you, Becky?

07:38.458 --> 07:39.660
I'm giving up cash here.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.361
You need some?

07:41.394 --> 07:42.462
Money, money, money.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.698
All you got to do is ask.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.199
Oh, somebody's still mad at me.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.100
Not me.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.569
No.

07:48.602 --> 07:51.171
So Becky, guess
you won't be going

07:51.204 --> 07:52.139
out with Jimmy this weekend.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.073
Shut up, Darlene.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.207
Ow.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.176
Hey, Darlene, knock it
off, and go to school.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.244
It's OK.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.546
I'm sure there are
plenty of others girls

07:58.579 --> 08:01.248
who will be happy
to go out with him,

08:01.281 --> 08:06.386
maybe even a hot-looking
senior with low self-esteem.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.387
Is there coffee?

08:07.420 --> 08:08.221
Yeah.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.694
Becky, would you
like more juice?

08:13.727 --> 08:15.262
Hey, princess.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.297
Oh, she's not talking, Dan.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.465
Is that right?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.299
Good morning, Dad.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.204
Oh, I stand corrected.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.906
She's not talking to me.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.340
Looks like.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.176
She's mad at me.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.143
Looks like.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.781
Can I have my allowance?

08:33.814 --> 08:37.184
It's an honor to have
you on the payroll.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.687
Thanks.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.055
Becky, you know what the
silent treatment does to me,

08:42.089 --> 08:43.123
don't you?

08:43.156 --> 08:45.325
It just makes me
want to talk more.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.728
In fact, it makes me want to
talk to constantly until you

08:47.761 --> 08:50.964
have no choice but to--

08:50.998 --> 08:51.965
she's coming around.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.434
Looks like.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.737
I want to thank you,
Dan, for letting her

08:56.770 --> 08:58.706
go out after I grounded her.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.508
That way, I'm the bad guy, and
you get to be the hero again.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.976
Aw, come on, Roseanne.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.411
She's just trying to
get a rise out of you.

09:04.444 --> 09:05.512
Ignore it.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.014
She's been trying to
get a rise out of me

09:07.047 --> 09:07.948
for the past month.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.182
What are you talking about?

09:09.216 --> 09:11.251
Dan, where've you been?

09:11.284 --> 09:12.986
She's hardly ever
home, and when she is,

09:13.020 --> 09:14.655
she's locked up in her room.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.324
She only comes down to yak on
the phone or to give me grief.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.859
Great Caesar's ghost.

09:18.892 --> 09:22.763
She's acting like a 14-year-old.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.698
She's obviously going
through something,

09:24.732 --> 09:26.533
and then she's not
even talking about it.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.869
Why don't you just try
backing off a little bit?

09:28.902 --> 09:31.972
Well, maybe I can pump
Darlene for some information

09:32.005 --> 09:33.641
when she comes home
from school today.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.175
Oh, my god.

09:35.208 --> 09:38.111
My worst fears have
finally come true.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.247
She's turned into her mother.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.682
I have not.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.284
And don't you ever
say that to me again.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.819
OK, Bev.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.688
Hey, hey, I mean it.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.623
Kind of touchy, aren't you?

09:49.657 --> 09:51.825
Say, your mom's pretty much
the same way, isn't she?

09:51.859 --> 09:53.326
You're give me a heartburn.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.997
I'm sorry, honey.

09:57.030 --> 10:01.969
Say, doesn't your
mom get heartburn?

10:02.002 --> 10:05.806
Becky, I want to talk to you.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.808
Becky, open this door.

10:07.841 --> 10:08.709
[rock music]

10:08.742 --> 10:13.113
Becky, open the door.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.247
Turn that down, Becky.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.484
I want to talk to you.

10:17.517 --> 10:22.355
Becky, open the door!

10:22.389 --> 10:23.590
Becky, I'm going
to count to five.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.925
And if you don't
open the door, I'm

10:24.958 --> 10:28.696
going to get the screwdriver
and take it off the hinges.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.197
I'm counting now.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.633
1, 2, 3.

10:33.667 --> 10:34.634
I'm counting, Becky.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.136
You hear me counting?

10:36.169 --> 10:43.543
4, 4 and 1/2, 5.

10:43.576 --> 10:44.544
All right.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.379
All right, that's it.

10:46.413 --> 10:47.214
Fine.

10:54.121 --> 10:54.988
I'm serious, Dan.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.223
Where's that screwdriver?

10:56.256 --> 10:57.958
Roseanne, you're not taking
the door off the hinges.

10:57.991 --> 10:58.859
It's ridiculous.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.894
Hey, I counted to five.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.530
Well, six actually 'cause
I did four and 1/2.

11:03.563 --> 11:06.533
Would you listen to yourself?

11:06.566 --> 11:08.268
I'm more worried about
you than I am about Becky.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.803
Well, I'm worried
about me, too.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.504
She drives me crazy.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.672
I tried joking with her.

11:12.706 --> 11:13.741
I tried yelling at her.

11:13.774 --> 11:14.908
I even tried being reasonable.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.944
But she still won't
say one word to me.

11:16.977 --> 11:17.978
Real battle for power.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.847
Yeah, and I'm losing.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.950
Hey, you're not
taking that door off.

11:22.983 --> 11:23.851
All right, then.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.352
You go up, and you talk to her.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.254
This is between you and Becky.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.621
Bringing me into
it is just going

11:28.655 --> 11:31.324
to make it seem like I'm on
your side, which-- which I am.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.193
No, you're not.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.028
You're neutral as usual.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.732
You just don't want to get
involved because she still

11:38.766 --> 11:40.700
thinks you're Mr. Perfect.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.435
Did she tell you that?

11:42.469 --> 11:45.038
(WHISPERING) Sorry.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.474
You're making way too
big a deal out of this.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.843
You watch too much Oprah.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.787
There is obviously
something wrong.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.221
Now where is that
damn screwdriver?

12:01.254 --> 12:02.622
In the garage.

12:02.655 --> 12:03.824
Fine.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.092
You going to help me take
that door off or not?

12:05.125 --> 12:06.693
- Not.
- Good.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.695
Then I'll just do it myself.
- Good.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.631
And if you can do anything
to help me with your damn kids,

thing left to say to you.

Father, will you pass the
toast to Mother, please?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.853
Tell Mother I
received her request,

12:32.886 --> 12:35.088
and I'm shipping the
toast out on the next arm.

Why, there's one leaving now.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.661
What's going on?

12:41.694 --> 12:43.096
Got me.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.631
Mom, what's going on?

12:44.664 --> 12:45.899
We're playing a game.

12:45.933 --> 12:46.967
Can I play?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.735
No, you're too mature
to play this game.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.808
Dad, can I go meet
Diane after breakfast?

12:54.842 --> 12:55.876
Did you do your chores?

13:03.817 --> 13:05.118
Gee, Darlene.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.887
I guess you'll be doing
the dishes for Becky

13:06.920 --> 13:09.089
again, since she's going out.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.091
No way.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.927
Becky, you're not sticking
me with the dishes again.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.528
So I'll do them
when I get home.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.365
Well, why don't you do
them before you leave.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.267
'Cause I can do
them when I get home.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.635
What's the difference?

13:22.669 --> 13:24.571
Because I said so.

13:24.604 --> 13:28.375
You're only making me do them
because she stuck her nose in.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.944
And you just always
do whatever she says.

13:30.978 --> 13:34.081
Becky, I believe you're
mistaken about that.

13:34.114 --> 13:37.117
Uh, I can see that room
becoming more and more mine.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.389
You always back into her.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.590
Everybody does.

13:43.623 --> 13:44.524
And I'm not going to let her.

13:44.557 --> 13:45.825
She can't control me.

13:45.859 --> 13:48.095
Oh, yes, I can.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.097
I am your mother,
and I will control

13:50.130 --> 13:51.631

- I wasn't talking to you.
- Oh, yes, you were.

Just then, she was talking
to me, wasn't she, Dan?

13:56.436 --> 13:57.337

slammed if we still have it.

Steve thought
that having Julia

14:17.457 --> 14:19.859
around would make it easier on
Joanne because Joanne worries

14:19.893 --> 14:21.995
so much about him being a cop.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.830
But then when he was
seeing that Swedish chick,

14:23.863 --> 14:25.365
she never worried at
all 'cause you know

14:25.398 --> 14:28.168

guys do all day,

discuss your personal problems?

was touched because clearly

cleaning her diary?

15:26.659 --> 15:28.295
remember when Mom
did that to you?

15:35.602 --> 15:38.238
I thought I had a
handle on my kids,

15:38.271 --> 15:41.274
but Becky's turned
into a total stranger.

15:41.308 --> 15:42.842

for clues, you know?

15:42.875 --> 15:44.844
So she's not talking to you.

15:44.877 --> 15:45.912
Big deal.

I didn't talk to
Mom for a month.

Yeah, and she went
stark raving mad.

You're the one that
told me to do it.

So see, Becky's no
different than we were.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.458
Yes, she is, and
the times we're living

15:58.491 --> 16:00.460
in are completely different.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.728

you know about it?

16:01.761 --> 16:03.163
You're not even a mom.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.232
When are you going to
quit throwing that up to me?

When your water breaks.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.142
Will you help me flip this one?

16:20.713 --> 16:24.184
Aha.

16:24.217 --> 16:28.555
Now this-- this
is Becky's diary.

You think that's, like,
the X-rated version?

fun at all, it is.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.929
Oh, thank you.

16:36.963 --> 16:38.631
What do you think she's
got written there?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.167
Stuff she doesn't
want you to see.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.101
Stuff about you.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.136
Stuff about sex.

Same stuff you used to
write in your diary.

How do you know what I
used to write in my diary?

Because I read it.

16:49.109 --> 16:49.976
You did not.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.444
I did, too.

16:51.478 --> 16:56.616
And I, quote, dear Lord, help
me stop doing you know what.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.224

No, you didn't.
- Oh, I did so.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.559
Oh, yeah?

17:06.593 --> 17:07.927
Oh, so where did I keep it?
- It doesn't matter.

17:08.828 --> 17:09.662
You don't know
where I kept it.

17:09.696 --> 17:10.597
And I didn't just read it.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.998
Mom read it, too.

She used to come in there and
read it right out loud and go,

is this true?

was ever secret.

Will you go set
the table for me?

here and talk to yourself.

Go.

some cleaning today,

19:22.195 --> 19:25.632

across your diary.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.499
Well, diaries.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.540
I didn't read it, though.

19:33.573 --> 19:37.244
I almost did, but
then I thought,

19:37.277 --> 19:39.412
I don't want to violate
my kids' privacy the way

19:39.446 --> 19:40.880
my mom violated mine.

19:40.913 --> 19:45.585
So I put it back
under the mattress.

19:45.618 --> 19:49.489
So what do you want, a prize?

19:49.522 --> 19:50.423
Thanks.

19:50.457 --> 19:51.258
You just gave me one.

19:56.496 --> 19:59.098

guess I hope that me

better relationship

understand everything

you understand everything

door 'cause that's the way

whenever you want to.

open it up, and let me in.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.927
Not anymore.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.395
Mom let me off the hook.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.996
No way.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.498
I got our door back, didn't I?

21:05.532 --> 21:07.266
And we're going to the mall.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.002
The old silent
treatment really worked.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.338
To perfection.

21:11.371 --> 21:14.240
Aunt Jackie is so brilliant.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.976
Mom is never going to pry
her way into my life again.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.277
She promised.

21:18.311 --> 21:21.348
Well, yeah, but now that
she's done haunting you,

21:21.381 --> 21:24.083
I mean, who do you think
she's going to go after?

21:24.116 --> 21:25.518
What about my life?

21:25.552 --> 21:27.354
Too bad.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.988
But it's going to be
a lot easier for you

21:29.021 --> 21:30.890
now that I've broken through.

21:30.923 --> 21:34.627
I mean, I have got Mom
exactly where I want her.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.271
Hi, I was just cleaning.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.306

21:53.079 --> 21:56.115
