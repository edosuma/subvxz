WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:04.405
( chatter )

00:04.438 --> 00:06.640
"Get Some" playing
in background

00:41.609 --> 00:43.811
Widow:
So this is how
my former regent

00:43.844 --> 00:47.248
spends the profits
he skimmed from
my oil fields.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.500
Relax.

01:06.534 --> 01:09.337
If I came here to kill you,
we wouldn't be talking.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.839
You're wasting
your time, Minerva.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.275
That person
doesn't exist
anymore.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.777
Right.
You're the Widow now.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.746
I didn't come here
to dwell on the past.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.548
I want to discuss
the future.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.583
You don't have a future.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.852
I told you when I left
it was only a matter of time

01:24.885 --> 01:26.854
before the other barons
moved on you.

01:26.887 --> 01:29.523
Oh, you think they're
gonna jeopardize
the oil supply?

01:29.557 --> 01:31.592
They recognized me,
Teague.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.629
All except Quinn.

01:35.663 --> 01:38.499
He's the most powerful baron
with the biggest Clipper force.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.900
The others might hate him,

01:39.933 --> 01:41.602
but they ain't gonna
go against him.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.404
That's why we need
to take him down.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.274
Once he's gone,
the other barons
will follow.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.309
Come back
and let's start over.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.534
( music fades )

02:20.641 --> 02:22.476
( people screaming )

02:39.860 --> 02:41.295
( groans )

02:47.335 --> 02:48.702
( groaning )

03:12.993 --> 03:14.262
Ah!

03:30.444 --> 03:31.845
( body thuds )

03:38.519 --> 03:40.921
- ( chokes )
- Who hired you?

03:42.055 --> 03:45.759
Quinn's son, Ryder.

03:45.793 --> 03:49.430
I didn't think
he had the imagination.

03:49.463 --> 03:53.000
Your honesty
is much appreciated.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.735
( gasps )

04:37.511 --> 04:37.811
( panting )

04:52.526 --> 04:54.928
( coughing )

05:07.508 --> 05:09.443
( gasps )

05:25.559 --> 05:26.627
( yelps )

05:33.901 --> 05:35.736
You make it a habit
of spying on people?

05:35.769 --> 05:36.870
I'm sorry.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.410
- I don't see a brand.
- My parents are free farmers.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.011
Nomads attacked.
I got away.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.117
How long have you
been out here?

05:50.150 --> 05:52.085
All night.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.490
I'm Tilda.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.630
M.K. Thanks.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.900
You're pretty good
with those things.

06:06.934 --> 06:10.638
I practice... a lot.

06:10.671 --> 06:14.374
Mother says natural ability
is no substitute for hard work.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.412
I've never seen one shaped
like butterflies before.

06:22.182 --> 06:25.519
( dogs barking )

06:25.553 --> 06:27.655
I gotta get
outta here.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.623
Man:
Let's go!

06:29.657 --> 06:31.492
M.K.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.593
Come with me.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.870
- ( barking )
- Man: Go!

06:47.841 --> 06:49.610
- ( horse neighs )
- Stop.

06:49.643 --> 06:52.045
- We hit the Widow's border.
- Who gives a damn?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.914
Someone helped him
escape

06:53.947 --> 06:55.916
and the boy is gonna
tell us who it is.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.118
We can't go
into the Widow's land
with the Clipper force.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.822
Baron's orders.
It's an act of war.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.557
You don't like it,
take it up with your father.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.493
Back to the fort.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.561
Man:
All right, let's go.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.597
- Man #2: Move it.
- Man #3: Go.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.114
( chuckles )

07:27.147 --> 07:28.749
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.850
Come on.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.796
( exhaling )

07:48.068 --> 07:50.003
- That's your mother?
- Yes.

07:50.037 --> 07:53.607
She's the baron,
but everyone calls her
"the Widow."

08:00.280 --> 08:02.149
Wait here.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.952
Mother doesn't
like to be disturbed
when she's training.

08:20.768 --> 08:24.838
The best we can tell,
the boy crossed into
the Widow's territory.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.206
We stopped our search
at her border.

08:26.239 --> 08:29.276
What did that boy
risk his life to steal?

08:29.309 --> 08:30.811
Here.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.852
You ever seen one
like this before, Sunny?

08:40.153 --> 08:41.622
No, Baron.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.791
He told me it belonged
to his mother.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.598
That boy didn't
get out alone.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.669
We have a traitor
inside the fort.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.705
I'll root out
this turncoat myself,
Father.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.674
I appreciate that.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.944
Last night the Widow
and her former regent

09:03.977 --> 09:06.614
were attacked by nomads.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.882
I need assurance
that this was not

09:08.916 --> 09:11.952
an unsanctioned action
on our part.

09:14.154 --> 09:17.591
You are the baron,
and I would never
go against you.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.796
I know that, son.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.999
And I value your loyalty.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.753
Use it.
You stink.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.154
Okay.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.322
Thanks.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.298
Mother said I couldn't
let you out of my sight.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.143
( water splashes )

10:26.694 --> 10:29.663
There's nothing
more soothing than
a warm bath.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.934
I didn't mean
to startle you.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.437
My son Percival
used to stay in that tub

10:37.470 --> 10:39.239
until his fingers
shriveled like peach pits.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.712
I didn't see any boys
in the house.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.958
Tilda told me what happened.
I'm sorry for your parents.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.795
I promise I won't be
staying long.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.231
You said they were farmers?

11:05.398 --> 11:08.235
Yeah.
They grew tobacco.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.706
It's harvest time.

11:12.740 --> 11:15.308
Your hands should be stained
with tobacco juice, but...

11:15.342 --> 11:17.444
yours are virgin white.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.884
I know you're
lying to me, M.K.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.352
You came
from the fort,
didn't you?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.260
There's no need
to be scared.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.296
I'm not like Quinn.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.331
I promise that
you're safe here.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.901
Thank you.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.737
I've been searching
for a boy your age.

11:43.771 --> 11:46.506
Last I heard,
he was in the fort.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.375
He wore a pendant.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.778
Looked like this.

11:53.881 --> 11:54.982
Never seen it before.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.054
Why do you
want this boy?

12:01.088 --> 12:02.923
Because he's very special.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.898
Well, there's
nothing special
about me.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.141
( car horn honks )

12:38.258 --> 12:39.827
( door opens )

12:48.035 --> 12:50.370
( birds chirping )

12:55.042 --> 12:56.209
( horse neighs )

12:56.243 --> 12:57.544
I'm going outside
the wall.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.312
Ride with me.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.048
I'll put together
an escort.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.083
No need.
We're going alone.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.390
( chatter )

13:20.167 --> 13:21.234
Another headache, Baron?

13:26.306 --> 13:28.909
Quinn:
My father was a cog
in these fields.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.378
He was beaten to death
by a spotter,

13:31.411 --> 13:34.614
right by that
miserable old pecan tree.

13:34.647 --> 13:38.251
Accused of taking
an extra cob of corn.

13:38.285 --> 13:41.855
He never raised a hand
in his defense...

13:41.889 --> 13:43.356
not once.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.492
Just...

13:45.525 --> 13:48.228
lay there while
they punched the life
out of him.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.399
That night
I went to my baron
and I said,

13:52.432 --> 13:55.468
"Baron, I want
to be a Clipper."

13:56.603 --> 13:58.205
( chuckling )

13:58.238 --> 14:01.208
Yeah, I was nothing
but a stunted runt, but...

14:01.241 --> 14:03.243
he put me in the pit

14:03.276 --> 14:06.947
with the biggest Colt
he had,

14:06.980 --> 14:10.951
and I snapped
that boy's neck
in 10 seconds flat.

14:13.586 --> 14:17.057
That was the first time
I ever felt alive.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.428
Hyah!

14:27.167 --> 14:30.070
Here's the thing--
I need your men.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.106
I look at you,

14:33.140 --> 14:35.408
well-dressed,
well-spoken,

14:35.442 --> 14:38.278
and I don't see
a nomad thug.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.147
I see a future baron.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.649
If you help me
topple Quinn,

14:42.682 --> 14:45.919
I'm offering you
a territory.

14:45.953 --> 14:49.389
I like what you're
preaching, lady,
I really do,

14:49.422 --> 14:53.360
but if we side with you,
we're setting ourselves up
to be slaughtered.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.028
You won't be alone.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.964
You and a bunch of girls

14:56.997 --> 14:58.698
are gonna help us
take down Quinn?

14:58.731 --> 15:00.467
( laughing )

15:00.500 --> 15:01.601
We're done here.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.203
Wait.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.939
The appearance of weakness
is the greatest advantage.

15:09.342 --> 15:12.712
If Tilda can take
one of you down,

15:12.745 --> 15:14.481
you'll accept
the terms of my deal.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.587
And if she can't...

15:20.620 --> 15:22.355
we get to keep her.

15:23.523 --> 15:24.958
It's a deal.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.948
( groans, gasps )

15:51.351 --> 15:52.519
( shouts )

15:55.222 --> 15:56.356
( groans )

16:01.694 --> 16:02.662
( snaps )

16:23.616 --> 16:24.684
To new alliances.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.390
( glasses clink )

16:35.228 --> 16:37.130
( horses approach )

16:39.199 --> 16:41.101
( horse neighs )

16:44.404 --> 16:45.705
Baron.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.208
Sorry for
the intrusion,
Hannah.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.809
Is the doc
around?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.278
( footsteps approaching )

16:52.445 --> 16:54.281
This is a surprise.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.116
I could've come
to the fort.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.285
I was just passing by.

17:19.572 --> 17:22.342
Veil was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

17:27.280 --> 17:31.251
Vernon and I,
we couldn't have
any ourselves.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.186
Veil was a gift
from the baron

17:33.220 --> 17:36.089
for saving his wife's life
when she had Ryder.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.291
We raised her
since she was
an infant.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.530
She told me
about the baby.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.813
If you love her,

18:00.847 --> 18:02.615
then tell her
how dangerous this is.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.817
The code is very clear--
I cannot have a family.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.787
I tried.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.390
There's no changing
her mind.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.359
She loves you, Sunny.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.361
I am trying
to save her life.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.330
She doesn't want a life
without you and that baby.

18:26.739 --> 18:30.843
Dr. Brooks:
It's a tumor, a growth.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.579
There's nothing
I can do.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.518
How long?

18:38.551 --> 18:40.787
Well, you'll see
the winter solstice.

18:42.822 --> 18:43.856
Maybe.

18:46.193 --> 18:49.362
Well, let's not tell Lydia.
You know how she fusses.

18:51.198 --> 18:53.666
You're going to start
to get weaker.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.369
I promise
to be discreet.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.271
Well, I appreciate
that, Doc.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.347
You're a good man.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.291
Everything okay, Baron?

19:18.325 --> 19:19.759
Never better,
thank you.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.884
I want you to do
something for me.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.219
Yes, Baron?

19:48.888 --> 19:51.591
I want you to go inside

19:51.624 --> 19:53.192
and clip those two.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.730
I don't understand.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.799
Sounded clear
coming out of my mouth.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.770
We only clip
our enemies.

20:03.803 --> 20:07.006
And how do you
define "enemy,"
Sunny?

20:07.039 --> 20:10.977
Someone who raises
a sword or a fist
to kill us?

20:11.010 --> 20:13.480
What if I told you
those two had a weapon

20:13.513 --> 20:15.682
that could destroy
everything I've built

20:15.715 --> 20:18.751
and bring me
to my knees?

20:18.785 --> 20:21.788
Baron, the doctor
delivered your son.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.490
They've been nothing
but loyal to you.

20:23.523 --> 20:26.025
An enemy
is anyone I name!

20:26.058 --> 20:27.594
Get in there!

20:30.497 --> 20:31.998
I can't.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.433
You what?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.539
You can't what?

21:11.338 --> 21:12.772
- Hannah: Baron?
- Dr. Brooks: Baron!

21:12.805 --> 21:16.443
Hannah:
No! Please, no!
Don't do this!

21:16.476 --> 21:19.812
- No! Oh, don't!
- Dr. Brooks: Baron, please!

21:19.846 --> 21:23.015
- Hannah: No!
Please, don't! Don't!
- Dr. Brooks: No! Don't!

21:23.049 --> 21:26.453
- Hannah: No!
Please, no, don't!
- ( slicing )

21:26.486 --> 21:27.854
- ( body thuds )
- Dr. Brooks: Hannah!

21:27.887 --> 21:29.856
Dr. Brooks:
What-- stop!

21:29.889 --> 21:31.458
- ( slices )
- ( Quinn shouts )

21:31.491 --> 21:33.360
- ( body thuds )
- ( clattering )

21:36.863 --> 21:38.765
( panting )

21:48.641 --> 21:52.379
I've never given anyone
a second chance.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.914
- As far as I'm concerned...
- ( sword thuds )

21:54.947 --> 21:56.449
...you killed them.

22:37.924 --> 22:38.458
( insects chirping )

23:21.868 --> 23:24.571
All right, let's have
a look at that wing.

23:24.604 --> 23:26.706
( coos )

23:26.739 --> 23:28.808
( tsking )

23:28.841 --> 23:31.544
It's okay, brother.
Yeah, yeah.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.049
( taps )

23:38.885 --> 23:40.887
I sure hope
that's the good stuff

23:40.920 --> 23:44.657
and not that dog-piss swill
they peddle down at Tick-Tock.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.225
( clicking tongue )

23:46.258 --> 23:47.960
Only the best
for you, Waldo.

23:49.228 --> 23:50.997
What happened to that one?

23:51.030 --> 23:54.601
Oh, please don't pretend
to give a shit about my birds.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.909
Something's eating
at you, Sunny.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.445
What is it?

24:10.082 --> 24:11.684
Have you ever thought
about getting out?

24:17.023 --> 24:18.157
What's out there?

24:18.190 --> 24:19.892
Freedom.

24:19.926 --> 24:22.629
Ah, overrated.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.531
People don't really
want to be free.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.666
Besides,
it's an illusion.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.601
I mean,
you take my birds--

24:28.635 --> 24:30.202
oh, they just love
flying free,

24:30.236 --> 24:34.674
but every night
they fly on home
to their cages

24:34.707 --> 24:36.843
where it's safe
and warm.

24:36.876 --> 24:40.613
Sunny, you know
what's out there
beyond our borders?

24:40.647 --> 24:42.715
A big sack
full of stories.

24:42.749 --> 24:45.217
It's a wasteland.
No, no, it's a paradise.

24:45.251 --> 24:47.954
It's a... whatever.

24:47.987 --> 24:51.724
Nobody knows what is
and ain't true.

24:51.758 --> 24:54.026
And, besides...

24:54.060 --> 24:56.596
Quinn will never
let you go.

24:56.629 --> 24:59.298
You walk out on him,
he'll hunt you down,

24:59.331 --> 25:00.900
track you to the edge
of this world,

25:00.933 --> 25:04.537
and then, sure as shit,
he will slit your throat.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.311
( sighs )

25:12.344 --> 25:14.847
No, Sunshine...

25:14.881 --> 25:18.517
you can't ever
outrun who you are.

25:27.226 --> 25:28.260
Freedom.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.999
And cages.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.914
M.K. is lying.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.281
I suspect
he's the one.

25:50.983 --> 25:54.020
You said that boy
is powerful.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.956
M.K. is the opposite.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.658
At least
he seems so to me.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.160
That's because
his power is sleeping.

26:01.193 --> 26:03.630
It only wakes
when his emotions
are stirred

26:03.663 --> 26:05.031
and his skin is cut.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.736
Would you be
willing to provoke him
and draw his blood?

26:12.271 --> 26:13.973
If you aren't
up to the task, Tilda,

26:14.006 --> 26:16.976
I'm sure one of your sisters
would gladly volunteer.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.778
No, no, I found him.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.347
It's my duty.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.390
When you cut him,
he'll change.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.793
He'll become
incredibly dangerous.

26:36.162 --> 26:37.664
I understand.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.412
M.K.,

26:53.445 --> 26:56.382
everyone in our family
must learn how to fight.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.185
I've asked Tilda
to begin your training.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.921
I'm not interested.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.394
It's not a request.

27:18.070 --> 27:21.140
Look, Tilda--

27:21.173 --> 27:22.809
What were you really
doing in the woods?

27:22.842 --> 27:25.211
- Running for my life.
- Liar!

27:30.482 --> 27:33.452
Ah! Tilda, stop!
Tilda, stop, please!

27:33.485 --> 27:35.354
Please, please.
I have a mother, too.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.423
I have a mother, too.
I was in those woods

27:37.456 --> 27:41.060
because I was trying
to find her and get home.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.863
Trust me.
I'm telling you
the truth.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.383
- Now scream.
- Aaah!

28:30.442 --> 28:31.077
( footsteps approaching )

28:38.550 --> 28:44.156
My parents were kind
and decent people.

28:50.229 --> 28:53.132
So, tell me, Sunny...

28:53.165 --> 28:54.767
why are they dead?

28:58.004 --> 29:00.239
Which one of your men
did Quinn send?

29:04.176 --> 29:06.312
He did it himself.

29:09.215 --> 29:11.150
I think Quinn is dying...

29:12.584 --> 29:14.921
and he's scared
of anyone finding out.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.362
He took my family.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.076
I'm your family now.

29:40.079 --> 29:42.014
And I'm going
to protect you.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.251
Both of you.

29:48.487 --> 29:52.324
I don't know
how or when...

29:52.358 --> 29:54.393
but we're getting out
of the Badlands.

30:06.939 --> 30:09.842
( music playing
in background )

30:21.053 --> 30:23.890
( gasping )

30:32.464 --> 30:34.366
You want a hit?

30:34.400 --> 30:35.534
Yeah.

30:58.324 --> 31:02.361
You must have
some special skills
I don't know about.

31:02.394 --> 31:06.465
'Cause how else
could you buy a brick
of my father's opium?

31:06.498 --> 31:07.633
It was a gift.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.501
( chuckles )

31:09.535 --> 31:11.270
( gasps )

31:11.303 --> 31:13.339
Don't bullshit me, bitch.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.142
( gasps )

31:16.175 --> 31:18.144
Nomads.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.212
They've got
an old turbine station
full of stuff.

31:24.350 --> 31:27.153
( chattering )

31:46.005 --> 31:47.239
( door opens )

31:52.678 --> 31:54.513
Tilda.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.150
Tilda.

31:59.718 --> 32:02.921
Tilda, you have
to help me escape.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.327
Supposedly,
the last baron
built a passage

32:08.360 --> 32:10.096
that goes from
this room to the woods.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.739
So, why did your mother
want to cut me?

32:20.772 --> 32:23.175
She's looking
for a boy.

32:23.209 --> 32:24.576
Says he has
some dark power.

32:26.212 --> 32:27.579
She wants to train him

32:27.613 --> 32:29.948
and then
use him to overthrow
the other barons.

32:39.358 --> 32:41.527
- ( door opens )
- ( gasps )

32:41.560 --> 32:44.596
- ( distant chatter )
- My mother's coming.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.498
( footsteps approaching )

32:46.532 --> 32:48.267
Hud:
Full recognition.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.968
Widow:
I'm a woman of my word.

32:53.605 --> 32:56.375
This is a beautiful place
you've got here.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.580
Tilda.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.256
You are no longer
welcome here.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.661
I'll take the boy.

33:15.694 --> 33:18.497
We're always looking
to build our ranks.

33:18.530 --> 33:19.765
( footsteps approach )

33:19.798 --> 33:23.102
Mother, Quinn's son
took the bait.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.370
Good.

33:29.775 --> 33:31.477
What's with the kid?
( laughs )

33:33.179 --> 33:36.182
He's been keeping secrets.

33:36.215 --> 33:37.683
That's one hefty bounty.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.285
Sure as hell
pissed off somebody.

33:47.359 --> 33:47.859
( birds chirping )

33:58.737 --> 34:02.074
Here he is.

34:02.108 --> 34:04.810
Apparently,
Ryder has uncovered
a conspiracy.

34:09.515 --> 34:12.151
Nomads are skimming
our opium shipments,

34:12.184 --> 34:15.354
selling them out of
an old turbine station
near Compton Ridge.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.755
Where did you hear that?

34:16.788 --> 34:19.525
Sex isn't the only thing
you buy in a doll house.

34:19.558 --> 34:22.528
See, this is what happens
when we don't retaliate.

34:22.561 --> 34:25.397
People think you're weak
and take advantage.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.233
We need to send a message.

34:32.638 --> 34:35.241
What do you think, Sunny?

34:35.274 --> 34:36.642
I think Ryder and I
should scout it out.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.246
Good work, son.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.787
( chatter )

35:08.640 --> 35:10.376
( grunting )

35:40.272 --> 35:42.408
There's
no opium here,
Sunny.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.711
Just us.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.586
( man laughs )

35:55.687 --> 35:57.456
The Widow
sends her regards.

36:00.459 --> 36:01.760
Man:
Come on, let's get 'em!

36:03.895 --> 36:06.432
Man:
Now!

36:06.465 --> 36:08.500
( man laughing )

36:08.534 --> 36:11.603
( choking, coughing )

36:11.637 --> 36:13.472
She wants him
to die slow.

36:13.505 --> 36:16.575
If you kill him, the baron
will hunt you down.

36:16.608 --> 36:17.743
He won't
get the chance.

36:17.776 --> 36:19.478
Once you two are dead,

36:19.511 --> 36:22.981
she's taking the fort
and gutting Quinn herself.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.316
( metal clangs )

36:34.793 --> 36:36.495
( clanging stops )

36:39.598 --> 36:42.701
- Let's do this.
- ( laughs )

36:42.734 --> 36:45.571
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Get him! Come on!

37:09.328 --> 37:10.596
Go! Come on!

37:34.620 --> 37:35.921
( gurgles )

37:37.088 --> 37:38.990
( men murmuring )

37:39.024 --> 37:40.392
Let's get him.
Come on.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.864
- Man: Kill him!
It's one guy!
- Man #2: Come on!

38:02.381 --> 38:03.782
( screams )

38:15.994 --> 38:17.596
Man:
Come on, come on!

38:20.866 --> 38:22.434
Man #2:
Get up there!

38:22.468 --> 38:24.370
Man:
Go! Go, get him!

38:25.471 --> 38:28.507
( men shouting )

39:02.741 --> 39:04.476
Hud:
Sunny.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.645
( choking )

39:16.988 --> 39:18.857
( coughing )

39:26.865 --> 39:28.534
How'd you get here?

39:31.069 --> 39:32.604
It doesn't matter.

39:34.673 --> 39:35.941
You better get going.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.095
I lied.

39:57.128 --> 40:00.165
I know the way
out of the Badlands,

40:00.198 --> 40:02.568
but I can't get out
by myself.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.643
I can't go with you.

40:11.677 --> 40:13.745
Quinn would hunt me down.

40:16.582 --> 40:17.783
There might be
another way.

40:20.486 --> 40:22.888
I could train you.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.190
- I don't understand.
- There's a woman.

40:25.223 --> 40:27.793
You'd have
to take her with you
and protect her.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.463
Sunny, I can't do that.

40:31.497 --> 40:35.033
That's a bad idea.
You've seen what I can do.

40:35.066 --> 40:37.603
There must be a way
to control it.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.643
I'm getting home.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.619
Lydia:
Ryder!

40:53.652 --> 40:55.754
Get him in the house!

40:55.787 --> 40:58.023
- He's alive.
- Get the doctor.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.628
What happened?

41:02.661 --> 41:04.095
It was an ambush.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.964
The Widow
is planning on
taking the fort.

41:11.903 --> 41:13.238
Who was it
that helped you escape?

41:13.271 --> 41:15.574
M.K.:
I didn't see.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.576
I woke up
and the lock was cut.

41:17.609 --> 41:20.145
This boy is the only reason
Ryder and I are still alive.

41:20.178 --> 41:22.080
Is that so?

41:22.113 --> 41:23.615
I would like to
take him as my Colt.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.957
You've never taken
a Colt before.

41:35.193 --> 41:36.728
You must be special.

41:36.762 --> 41:38.964
( grunting )

41:38.997 --> 41:42.167
- You pledge your
loyalty to me?
- Yes, Baron.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.703
Would you kill
in my name?

41:44.736 --> 41:46.037
Yes, Baron.

41:47.639 --> 41:49.775
I'll be watching you.

41:49.808 --> 41:51.643
Saddle up.

42:13.131 --> 42:15.634
( music playing )
