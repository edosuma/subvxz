WEBVTT

01:22.282 --> 01:24.376
I'm sorry, Tyson, I'm lost.

01:24.484 --> 01:26.282
And how do I teach you something.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.914
I don't even understand myself?

01:33.860 --> 01:37.262
Well, maybe I can learn,
and then you can learn from me.

01:44.504 --> 01:47.997
How about we take a break
and have some lemonade?

01:48.108 --> 01:51.043
Yes, a break and some lemonade.

01:51.144 --> 01:53.579
- I'd like some lemonade.
- Great.

02:25.245 --> 02:27.907
May I remind you, football players,

02:28.014 --> 02:30.881
that the State Championship
is three months away,

02:31.184 --> 02:35.746
and you are not gonna win it by
runnin' like a bunch of bench warmers!

02:36.422 --> 02:39.016
Now, line it up! We're goin' again!

02:40.193 --> 02:42.355
Hey, Mr. Kidman,

02:42.495 --> 02:44.930
whoever crosses that goal line last,

02:45.532 --> 02:47.557
is off the team!

02:48.067 --> 02:51.002
Now, you're their leader,
you gonna lead 'em!

02:51.237 --> 02:54.867
Yes, sir, Coach, I got you.
All right, let's go, folks.

03:28.875 --> 03:32.743
<i>It's about trust,
hard work, dedication.</i>

03:32.845 --> 03:36.247
<i>If we can incorporate those principles
into our practices every day</i>

03:37.483 --> 03:38.848
<i>and out there on the field,</i>

03:38.952 --> 03:42.217
<i>I fully expect we'll be the last team
standing at the end of this season.</i>

03:42.322 --> 03:44.654
<i>With a record seven undefeated seasons</i>

03:44.791 --> 03:47.123
<i>and five state championship
titles in a row,</i>

03:47.227 --> 03:48.319
<i>Coach Bobby Hollerman</i>

03:48.428 --> 03:51.989
<i>is the winningest high school
football coach in state history.</i>

03:52.098 --> 03:55.432
<i>In other sports-related news,
it's official, Stand bridge City</i>

03:55.535 --> 03:57.196
<i>is getting a sanctioned marathon.</i>

03:57.303 --> 03:59.863
<i>Here's what our mayor had to say
about the announcement.</i>

03:59.973 --> 04:02.203
<i>Mayor, why a marathon?</i>

04:02.308 --> 04:05.710
There are those who surmise
this is simply an election stunt

04:05.812 --> 04:07.678
at the taxpayers' expense.

04:07.780 --> 04:11.683
So, I ask you, is this pure,
political spectacle,

04:11.784 --> 04:14.583
or a genuine sporting spectacular?

04:18.691 --> 04:21.820
<i>Hosting an AIMS-sanctioned
international invitational marathon</i>

04:21.928 --> 04:24.920
<i>will help put our great city on
the map and make it even greater.</i>

04:26.299 --> 04:29.325
<i>Here we are, Atlanta.
Movin' through our Thursday,</i>

04:29.435 --> 04:32.166
<i>nothing but sunshine in store
for the forecast.</i>

04:32.272 --> 04:34.172
<i>We have a few clouds
early this morning,</i>

04:34.274 --> 04:36.333
<i>however, those will burn off
by the afternoon,</i>

04:36.442 --> 04:40.242
<i>and we are left with sunny skies
and a high of 73 degrees.</i>

04:40.346 --> 04:41.346
<i>Friday through Sunday...</i>

04:41.414 --> 04:42.609
Hey, Tyson.

04:42.749 --> 04:46.151
<i>warming trend, with highs,
something up to 81 degrees,</i>

04:46.252 --> 04:48.346
<i>and then Monday, sunshine all day.</i>

04:48.454 --> 04:50.616
- Tyson.
- Yes, Mom?

04:50.890 --> 04:53.689
Your father's home.
He said "hello" to you.

04:53.793 --> 04:54.817
Hello, Father.

04:56.195 --> 04:57.253
Hi, honey.

04:58.731 --> 05:00.324
Hi.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.834
<i>Follow us on social media...</i>

05:03.202 --> 05:04.465
How was practice?

05:06.906 --> 05:08.874
It was fine.

05:08.975 --> 05:12.639
Dinner will be ready by the time
you finish your shower.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.270
Okay.

05:18.217 --> 05:19.275
Sweetie,

05:20.720 --> 05:23.212
dinner as soon as your father's
done with his shower.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.924
- Tyson?
- Yes, Mom.

05:30.029 --> 05:33.021
Dinner as soon as my father
is done with his shower.

05:50.216 --> 05:53.743
Thank you for this food
we are about to receive. Amen.

06:16.809 --> 06:19.335
Tyson, why don't you ask your father
how his day was?

06:21.547 --> 06:23.140
Okay, Mom.

06:24.784 --> 06:27.276
How was your day today, Father?
Was it fine?

06:27.387 --> 06:29.947
My day was fine, except for algebra.

06:32.091 --> 06:34.116
Do they have algebra
at your school, Father?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.524
Yes, Tyson.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.828
Then maybe,
I can start going to your school,

06:40.933 --> 06:42.833
if they have algebra.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.341
Your mother home schools you, Tyson.

06:52.311 --> 06:54.837
Yes, my mother home schools me,

06:55.114 --> 06:57.515
but she can't teach me
what she doesn't understand.

06:57.617 --> 07:01.645
And she doesn't understand algebra.
It confused her.

07:02.221 --> 07:06.715
So, I studied it on my own today,
and one of my answers was incorrect.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.662
If I go to your school,
I can learn algebra,

07:09.762 --> 07:11.127
and then teach my mother,

07:11.230 --> 07:13.892
and I could see you at your school,
teaching football.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.697
Coaching. I coach football.

07:19.906 --> 07:22.637
Yes, that's right, you coach football.

07:23.109 --> 07:27.171
"Coach," a noun,
an instructor or trainer in sport.

07:28.014 --> 07:31.609
"Coach," a verb,
to teach or supervise someone.

07:31.984 --> 07:34.453
To act as a trainer as in sports.

07:34.554 --> 07:37.148
To coach an athlete
or an athletic team.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.256
I could learn algebra at your school

07:40.359 --> 07:43.056
and I could see you at your school
coaching football.

07:50.503 --> 07:51.937
<i>Didn't it ever occur to you</i>

07:52.038 --> 07:54.006
<i>that maybe
it has nothing to do with algebra?</i>

07:54.474 --> 07:58.934
That maybe, just maybe,
he wants to go to your school

07:59.045 --> 08:01.571
to be near you,
to be part of your world?

08:03.816 --> 08:05.682
Tyson's in his own world.

08:07.954 --> 08:12.016
I think we can both agree
that he's just not gonna fit.

08:12.124 --> 08:13.853
Fit in what?

08:13.960 --> 08:15.189
Your image?

08:17.630 --> 08:19.325
Tyson is not...

08:20.099 --> 08:22.431
Say it, Bobby. Normal?

08:25.771 --> 08:27.671
He's not ready.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.405
That is such a bad excuse.

08:32.478 --> 08:36.415
I can't believe you are
that ashamed of him, Bobby.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.912
Look, these other kids...

08:40.019 --> 08:42.181
They're not yours!

08:42.288 --> 08:44.848
They are not yours!

08:49.195 --> 08:50.195
Okay.

08:51.497 --> 08:55.024
You don't think I'm afraid of
what Tyson will face if he were to go?

08:56.068 --> 08:58.366
If the other kids will be nice to him?

08:58.471 --> 09:01.873
Coach Hollerman,
you make them be nice to him.

09:01.974 --> 09:04.466
You make them be nice to your son!

09:23.596 --> 09:24.722
Ellie?

09:30.202 --> 09:31.397
You okay?

09:37.476 --> 09:38.534
Eloise?

09:42.615 --> 09:45.516
Dinner must not have agreed
with my stomach, that's all.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.017
You have a great day, Tyson.

10:19.752 --> 10:23.245
You have a great day, too, Mom,
not homeschooling me.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.951
Come on, let's go!

10:27.960 --> 10:31.089
- Okay, bye.
- Goodbye.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.525
Bye again, Mom.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.275
Seat belt.

10:52.518 --> 10:54.543
Buckle up for safety.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.325
Take this.

11:40.433 --> 11:44.336
My number's programmed in there,
in case you run into any problems.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.667
Did you program
Mom's number in it, too?

11:46.772 --> 11:49.503
Yes, your mother's number
is programmed in there.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.837
I will try
not to run into any problems.

11:56.682 --> 11:58.207
Okay, you ready?

12:03.189 --> 12:05.157
Okay, the liver.

12:11.063 --> 12:14.328
Hello, my name is Tyson Hollerman.

12:14.433 --> 12:17.266
I am 15 years old, and until today,

12:17.369 --> 12:19.531
I have been homeschooled by my mom.

12:19.638 --> 12:20.901
Tard alert.

12:21.006 --> 12:23.134
Forrest Chump in the house!

12:23.242 --> 12:25.643
All right, all right,
calm down, all right.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.440
One more crack like that,
Bradley Burton,

12:27.546 --> 12:29.605
you're gonna find yourself
out in the hall.

12:29.715 --> 12:32.116
Good morning, Tyson.
We've been expecting you.

12:32.218 --> 12:33.708
Please, take the open seat.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.421
Thank you. I will take the open seat.

12:39.625 --> 12:40.717
Guys.

12:44.730 --> 12:45.788
Hey, hey!

12:46.132 --> 12:48.294
Focus, guys, focus.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.424
The liver.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.873
You are definitely pregnant.

13:02.681 --> 13:04.445
Seven weeks, give or take.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.521
Hmm.

13:11.724 --> 13:15.558
And is this baby
more than likely to be like my first?

13:16.495 --> 13:20.056
The likelihood of this child
having the same genetic disorder

13:20.166 --> 13:22.294
as your first is increased,

13:22.401 --> 13:25.268
but I would hesitate
to characterize the chances

13:25.371 --> 13:27.430
as more than likely.

13:28.741 --> 13:29.741
So, pick a number.

13:29.809 --> 13:34.076
I mean, are we talkin' 60/40, 50/50?

13:34.280 --> 13:36.510
'Cause I'm gonna be 42 next month.

13:36.615 --> 13:40.142
And, I mean,
no matter what the odds are,

13:40.252 --> 13:43.017
this baby I'm carryin'
is gonna be startin' out

13:43.122 --> 13:45.284
with two big strikes against it.

13:46.091 --> 13:48.788
Things have a way
of working out for the best.

13:51.297 --> 13:52.492
There's still time.

13:53.732 --> 13:56.326
Yeah, too much, and then not enough.

14:02.808 --> 14:04.173
All right,

14:04.443 --> 14:06.104
this is the stomach.

14:06.579 --> 14:07.579
All right?

14:08.013 --> 14:10.812
And behind it, is this organ.

14:10.916 --> 14:14.318
Who can tell me what this organ is?

14:17.756 --> 14:18.756
Bradley.

14:20.559 --> 14:21.651
A penis?

14:23.796 --> 14:26.822
Now, Mr. Burton, you know very well,
that is not a penis.

14:29.435 --> 14:30.527
A vagina?

14:31.904 --> 14:32.962
All right, that's enough.

14:33.072 --> 14:34.631
You just started out
your freshman year

14:34.740 --> 14:36.970
with an F in anatomy, Mr. Burton.

14:37.076 --> 14:40.239
Now, anyone else care
to venture a guess?

14:43.816 --> 14:45.147
Mr. Hollerman.

14:45.684 --> 14:46.684
Pancreas.

14:46.752 --> 14:49.119
Pancreas. Very good, Mr. Hollerman.

14:49.889 --> 14:50.981
Pancreas.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.724
A gland organ in the endocrine
and digestive system.

14:56.028 --> 14:59.396
It is both an endocrine gland
producing several important hormones,

14:59.498 --> 15:02.365
including Insulin, glucagon,
and somatostatin,

15:02.902 --> 15:05.496
and a digestive organ,
secreting pancreatic juice

15:05.604 --> 15:07.038
that contains digestive enzymes

15:07.139 --> 15:09.403
that act to facilitate
the absorption of nutrients

15:09.541 --> 15:11.839
and assist in the breaking down
of carbohydrates,

15:11.944 --> 15:13.935
proteins, and lipids in the chyme.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.583
Thank you, Mr. Hollerman.

15:19.151 --> 15:20.346
That was a very, uh,

15:21.220 --> 15:23.951
detailed explanation.

15:24.056 --> 15:27.822
Now, can anyone tell me what this is?

15:31.730 --> 15:32.730
Come on.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.573
<i>Here's the staff.</i>

15:45.678 --> 15:48.010
<i>Hollerman goes back,
lookin' for a man down field.</i>

15:48.147 --> 15:50.411
<i>He's got time, but
here comes that little White Dodger.</i>

15:50.516 --> 15:52.143
<i>And he's got him!</i>

15:52.251 --> 15:55.448
<i>He's got him!
He goes down with a boom!</i>

16:04.563 --> 16:05.563
Hi, Ellie.

16:05.998 --> 16:09.298
Hi. How's Tyson?
Have you checked on him?

16:09.635 --> 16:12.627
I did check on him and he seemed fine.

16:13.172 --> 16:15.038
Well, go check on him again.

16:17.176 --> 16:19.144
Every 30 minutes, really.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.876
So, her old man says
she can't see me anymore,

16:23.983 --> 16:26.680
until I straighten up
and act more my age.

16:26.785 --> 16:29.447
I mean, seriously? I'm frickin' 15!

16:29.888 --> 16:31.151
So, did you dump her?

16:31.790 --> 16:33.781
Like a load of dirt.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.660
Hey, check it out.

16:43.402 --> 16:45.666
Weird Boy Wonder rockin' the spot.

16:47.072 --> 16:50.508
Better chill on crackin' on him.
He's Coach's kid.

16:50.976 --> 16:53.445
Whatever! I don't play football.

16:54.713 --> 16:55.805
Hey, yo, Tyson!

16:56.715 --> 16:57.715
Over here!

16:58.083 --> 16:59.107
Come sit with us!

17:15.567 --> 17:17.661
Don't be rude to our guest, Jonesy.

17:17.903 --> 17:19.962
Get your big butt up
and give him your seat.

17:24.009 --> 17:26.376
There you go, Tyson. Cop a squat.

17:28.147 --> 17:29.308
Sit down.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.308
Okay. Thank you.

17:49.601 --> 17:51.000
You guys!

17:55.107 --> 17:56.506
You are such a jerk!

18:00.345 --> 18:01.345
You okay?

18:06.118 --> 18:07.745
You can come sit with us.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.353
Thank you for the fun.

18:19.832 --> 18:23.632
Dude, you shouldn't have done that.

18:23.735 --> 18:24.930
Why not?

18:25.037 --> 18:27.699
The retard had no problem
showing me up in anatomy class

18:27.806 --> 18:30.275
with his seven billion Einstein IQ.

18:34.746 --> 18:37.215
And I'm gonna put Mark um at center.

18:37.516 --> 18:41.316
Mark um? The big kid who decorated
the end zone with his lunch?

18:41.954 --> 18:44.753
Just because a boy needs
a little extra attention,

18:44.857 --> 18:46.723
doesn't mean
he can't be a winner, right?

18:46.825 --> 18:48.657
All right, your team.

18:49.728 --> 18:50.957
Hello, Father.

18:51.897 --> 18:52.921
Hi, Tyson.

18:55.267 --> 18:58.498
I've completed my first day
at your school,

18:58.604 --> 18:59.935
but I didn't learn algebra today,

19:00.038 --> 19:03.474
because algebra class
is on Thursdays, after History.

19:06.845 --> 19:08.370
Hey, Tyson, how are you, buddy?

19:09.748 --> 19:12.080
I'm fine, Assistant Coach Sweeney.

19:12.184 --> 19:14.585
How are you? Are you fine, too?

19:14.920 --> 19:16.684
Yeah, I'm fine, too.

19:19.424 --> 19:20.585
Tyson, come in.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.723
What happened to your shirt?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.827
Shannon says I was punked.

19:29.868 --> 19:31.802
I don't really understand
what that means,

19:31.904 --> 19:33.963
but Shannon is very nice.

19:36.742 --> 19:40.303
Not as nice as Mom,
but basically, very nice.

19:44.316 --> 19:46.580
Did you acquire all
of these awards and accolades

19:46.685 --> 19:48.175
from all your victories?

19:48.720 --> 19:51.712
The teams that I coached did.

19:51.823 --> 19:54.815
Who punked you
and who is this Shannon?

19:58.297 --> 19:59.355
Tyson.

19:59.464 --> 20:00.556
Yes, Father?

20:00.666 --> 20:02.259
I asked you

20:02.367 --> 20:05.428
what happened to your shirt
and who Shannon was.

20:07.472 --> 20:08.496
Answer me.

20:09.441 --> 20:11.910
Bradley and his friend punked me.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.741
Shannon is very nice and pretty girl

20:14.913 --> 20:17.439
who thinks Bradley is a total jerk.

20:17.549 --> 20:21.281
But I think
Bradley is just silly and immature.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.720
He thinks a pancreas
is a reproductive organ.

20:27.859 --> 20:28.859
Gentlemen,

20:29.728 --> 20:31.560
contact means hitting.

20:32.664 --> 20:35.190
It means hitting hard.

20:35.534 --> 20:36.534
If you wanna win,

20:36.702 --> 20:39.501
you have to hit your opponent
twice as hard!

20:40.939 --> 20:43.533
Now, our march to an undefeated season

20:43.642 --> 20:47.636
and a state championship title
begins today.

20:48.513 --> 20:49.605
So, let's get after it.

20:49.715 --> 20:51.012
You heard what he said!

20:51.116 --> 20:53.050
Let's line up and spread out!

20:54.419 --> 20:55.580
Let's go!

21:02.761 --> 21:05.958
Perhaps, I can become a gentleman
on your football team, Father.

21:06.965 --> 21:09.593
In order to help you win
the state championship title?

21:10.769 --> 21:12.430
Well, I'll tell you what.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.735
All that stuff over there
could use good straightening up.

21:20.879 --> 21:22.574
Okay, Father.

21:22.681 --> 21:25.343
I will help you and your team
by giving all that stuff over there

21:25.450 --> 21:26.918
a really good straightening up.

21:27.319 --> 21:28.319
Thank you.

21:30.689 --> 21:32.589
You're welcome, Father.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.158
All right,
we play like we practice!

21:36.161 --> 21:37.959
We play like we practice!

21:38.363 --> 21:41.333
Let's go, let's go!
Let's see some speed off the line!

21:41.433 --> 21:42.433
Go!

21:43.702 --> 21:44.702
Faster!

21:46.705 --> 21:47.705
Let's go!

21:48.740 --> 21:51.209
Come on,
watch the ball on the right side!

21:51.310 --> 21:54.610
Speed! Let's go,
let's do it again! Execute.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.817
Let's go, let's go. Hey, man!
Call it when you see it!

22:07.793 --> 22:09.261
Find a hole!

22:12.364 --> 22:14.594
Come back.
Get on the line. Do it again!

22:21.273 --> 22:24.140
What is happening here?
What is happening here?

22:24.242 --> 22:26.404
Get back on the line,
and let's do it again!

22:26.511 --> 22:28.570
We're gonna do it
till we get it right!

22:29.281 --> 22:31.579
My grandma plays better than you guys,
let's do this.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.080
Let's go again, what are we doing?

23:15.927 --> 23:16.927
What's your name?

23:18.730 --> 23:20.391
My... My name is Tyson.

23:20.499 --> 23:21.864
Stand up straight, Tyson.

23:22.834 --> 23:23.834
Good.

23:23.969 --> 23:26.028
Now, put your hands behind your head

23:26.138 --> 23:28.766
and breathe in a smooth rhythm
like this.

23:36.515 --> 23:37.914
I am Aklilu.

23:40.952 --> 23:43.011
Perhaps, we can run together
again sometime.

23:44.055 --> 23:45.055
Yes.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.692
Perhaps, we can run together
again sometime.

23:48.326 --> 23:49.816
Goodbye, my young friend.

23:50.328 --> 23:51.386
Goodbye, Aklilu!

23:54.800 --> 23:56.359
Who was that?

23:56.468 --> 23:59.233
Aklilu. And I'm his young friend.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.935
I'd like to hear more
about your first day at school,

24:04.042 --> 24:06.204
besides the food stains and football.

24:07.679 --> 24:09.078
Well, some of the boys in my grade

24:09.181 --> 24:11.582
are going to drive their own cars
to school next year.

24:13.018 --> 24:14.110
I have a question.

24:14.553 --> 24:16.578
Can I drive my own car
to school next year, too?

24:19.791 --> 24:23.785
Having your own car, Tyson, is a...
It's big responsibility.

24:26.031 --> 24:28.432
Well, perhaps,
I can drive your car, Father,

24:28.533 --> 24:31.059
until I am responsible enough
to have my own car.

24:31.570 --> 24:33.197
Shannon says your car is lit.

24:33.672 --> 24:34.672
Who's Shannon?

24:35.841 --> 24:39.072
Shannon is a girl
and she was nice to me.

24:39.177 --> 24:42.670
Not as nice as you are to me, Mom,
but she was basically very nice to me.

24:43.281 --> 24:45.477
I'm glad
you made a friend, sweetheart.

24:47.352 --> 24:50.322
Because Shannon was nice to me,
does that mean she is my friend,

24:50.989 --> 24:52.582
or because she's a girl
and nice to me,

24:52.691 --> 24:54.591
does that mean she's my girlfriend?

24:54.860 --> 24:57.727
And if she is my girlfriend, then
does that mean I have to kiss her,

24:57.896 --> 24:59.523
like you used to kiss
my mother, Father?

25:05.270 --> 25:06.829
Eat your food, Tyson.

25:08.106 --> 25:10.268
I am eating my food, Father.

25:10.375 --> 25:12.537
But is Shannon my girlfriend
or just my friend?

25:15.947 --> 25:17.574
That's what I'd like to know.

25:23.722 --> 25:26.589
I'll ask Shannon if she is
my friend or just my girlfriend,

25:26.691 --> 25:28.523
if she is nice to me again.

25:35.901 --> 25:38.199
Oh, please,
tell me that's not Shannon.

25:40.005 --> 25:42.667
- No, that is not Shannon.
- Thank God.

25:43.942 --> 25:45.774
That girl is sexy.

25:45.877 --> 25:47.470
Shannon is more like you, Mom.

25:48.880 --> 25:49.904
Oh.

25:51.316 --> 25:52.511
Well, goodbye, Mom.

25:53.952 --> 25:56.444
Tyson,
your father will be in his office

25:56.621 --> 25:58.385
if you have a problems
with those boys again

25:58.490 --> 26:00.458
or if you need help
with anything, okay?

26:01.593 --> 26:04.062
I will try not have a problem
with those boys again,

26:04.262 --> 26:06.731
and I will try not to need
my father's help with anything.

26:07.899 --> 26:08.899
Tyson,

26:10.235 --> 26:11.634
have a good day, okay?

26:13.104 --> 26:15.163
I will have a good day, Mom.

26:20.378 --> 26:23.279
<i>Therefore,
doctors must rely on patient history</i>

26:23.381 --> 26:27.978
<i>and a clinical exam to diagnose
mild traumatic brain injury.</i>

26:31.256 --> 26:34.749
<i>Know the signals. My head's not only
in the game and inside my helmet,</i>

26:36.795 --> 26:38.524
<i>it's in your hands.</i>

26:46.271 --> 26:48.797
- Yeah, Hollerman.
- Saw you on television.

26:50.809 --> 26:52.038
Oh, yeah?

26:52.177 --> 26:53.177
Mmm.

26:53.411 --> 26:56.312
Considering the first kick-off
of the season ain't even happened yet,

26:56.414 --> 26:58.439
sounds like some pretty big talk.

26:59.217 --> 27:01.185
Well, it must've been the camera.

27:01.286 --> 27:05.587
You know, they say that it makes
things bigger than they really are.

27:05.824 --> 27:08.486
Speaking of bigger,
got me a new running back.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.390
<i>Jerome Walker, up from Katy.</i>

27:11.496 --> 27:14.363
<i>"Junior, 5'11", 210.</i>

27:15.033 --> 27:16.592
Son-of-a-gun cuts like
a quarter horse,

27:16.701 --> 27:18.362
hits like a daggone freight train.

27:18.570 --> 27:19.570
Is that so?

27:20.005 --> 27:23.236
That's right.
With Walker in my backfield,

27:23.341 --> 27:26.311
we're for sure gonna give you
and your boys a run for your money,

27:26.444 --> 27:29.106
to see who represents our conference
at state this season.

27:30.115 --> 27:31.810
So, is it gonna be you
and this Walker kid,

27:31.916 --> 27:34.351
or you get to play
the rest of your squad?

27:35.654 --> 27:38.954
You'll see what I got in store for you
at the season opener, Hollerman.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.927
Well, I look forward to it, Ben.
You have yourself a nice day.

27:43.028 --> 27:44.154
<i>You, too, Bobby.</i>

28:15.894 --> 28:17.225
Oh, my God!

28:18.163 --> 28:19.163
Oh, my God!

28:22.067 --> 28:24.968
From what I see,
what you're experiencing

28:25.070 --> 28:27.698
isn't a miscarriage,
but what is referred to as

28:27.872 --> 28:30.671
a "threatened miscarriage."
It happens.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.936
The good news is that
your cervix is still closed

28:34.045 --> 28:36.241
and the fetus is still viable.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.141
Okay, so, now what?

28:39.150 --> 28:43.178
Until we get past this
first trimester, plenty of bed rest,

28:43.288 --> 28:46.849
plenty of water, stay off your feet
as much as possible,

28:46.958 --> 28:50.360
and no strenuous physical activity.

28:50.528 --> 28:51.552
Anything else?

28:53.331 --> 28:56.631
Avoid picking up
anything over ten pounds,

28:56.735 --> 29:00.171
keep your feet elevated
as much as possible.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.372
But other than that,
you just let nature take its course.

29:10.315 --> 29:13.012
- Why wouldn't you say anything?
- Say what?

29:14.219 --> 29:15.219
It's our decision.

29:15.987 --> 29:18.957
No, you made your decision
the day that Tyson was diagnosed.

29:20.358 --> 29:22.053
I'm not gonna debate this
in a parking lot.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.252
I'm gonna follow you home.

29:23.394 --> 29:26.364
Just go back to school, Bobby.
I'm fine.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.098
Ellie, we need to talk about this!

29:32.771 --> 29:34.569
No, we don't!

29:35.807 --> 29:39.175
I'd appreciate it if you did not
make me out to be a liar.

29:39.277 --> 29:42.713
Okay? So, please. Just go.
Tyson just might need you.

29:58.163 --> 29:59.892
Repeat after me.

29:59.998 --> 30:01.989
I was homeschooled until yesterday.

30:03.067 --> 30:07.197
My mother didn't teach me Spanish,
because she doesn't speak Spanish.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.672
I came to regular school
to learn algebra,

30:09.841 --> 30:12.776
but algebra class is on Thursday,
after History.

30:19.384 --> 30:22.649
Being able to speak a second language
is a good thing.

30:24.355 --> 30:27.950
And Spanish is the second most
widely spoken language in the world.

30:28.393 --> 30:30.225
But Chinese is the first.

30:31.462 --> 30:33.089
Can you teach Chinese?

30:36.534 --> 30:39.299
No. I can't teach Chinese.

30:45.376 --> 30:46.707
Let's go with you, Shannon.

31:43.968 --> 31:46.562
<i>It was Bradley
who was looking under your skirt.</i>

31:46.771 --> 31:49.900
He had a mirror hidden under his foot,
which he slid between your feet.

32:08.860 --> 32:12.421
Ms. Fernandez! Oh, my gosh!

32:13.464 --> 32:14.727
Ms. Fernandez?

32:15.934 --> 32:17.766
I need to speak to you about your son.

32:20.738 --> 32:21.738
Okay.

32:30.748 --> 32:34.275
Husky feet run in my family.

32:34.385 --> 32:37.844
I figure I shouldn't let that stop me
from taking on the challenge.

32:38.923 --> 32:42.655
Imagine me running a marathon.

32:43.061 --> 32:46.087
A challenge is nothing more
than an opportunity to believe.

32:48.099 --> 32:49.726
I like that.

32:50.368 --> 32:53.668
And I like these. I'll take 'em.

32:57.408 --> 32:58.876
You trying to get yourself killed?

32:59.811 --> 33:02.007
What in the world?

33:07.051 --> 33:08.541
Get out of the street!

33:10.221 --> 33:11.484
Hey, give the kid a break!

33:19.964 --> 33:22.296
- Hello, again, my friend.
- Hello, Aklilu.

33:22.533 --> 33:23.533
Take my hand.

33:25.703 --> 33:26.703
Why were you running?

33:26.771 --> 33:27.863
I was running to get away.

33:28.239 --> 33:29.707
Away from whom or what?

33:30.308 --> 33:31.400
From Spanish class.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.771
I often ran away from English class.

33:34.879 --> 33:37.007
That is why
my English is the way it is.

33:37.115 --> 33:39.277
Have that conversation
on the sidewalk!

33:39.384 --> 33:42.376
Please, come inside my store
for some water and some rest.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.820
I like the way you say things.

33:53.798 --> 33:56.961
Count your lucky stars
you didn't get yourself killed,

33:57.068 --> 33:58.627
running through the streets like that!

34:01.005 --> 34:02.097
The water is there.

34:06.477 --> 34:07.774
I apologize for the wait.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.905
Please, step over to the counter,
and I'll ring up your purchase.

34:11.015 --> 34:12.744
All right.

34:26.464 --> 34:27.625
Thank you so much!

34:41.479 --> 34:43.948
Were you the best runner in the world?

34:44.782 --> 34:47.979
There were certain days
when I ran well enough

34:48.086 --> 34:50.350
to finish ahead of some of
the best runners in the world.

34:55.326 --> 34:57.590
Can you teach me to run

34:57.695 --> 35:00.790
and finish ahead of some
of the best runners in the world

35:00.898 --> 35:02.127
on a certain day?

35:03.201 --> 35:05.727
I can help you to know how to run.

35:05.837 --> 35:08.499
But it is up to you
where and how you finish.

35:11.175 --> 35:12.175
Up to me.

35:14.045 --> 35:15.774
<i>Tyson Hollerman,</i>

35:15.880 --> 35:17.609
<i>running in his very first marathon,</i>

35:18.082 --> 35:20.949
is at this very moment
running some of the fastest

35:21.052 --> 35:24.750
per-minute-mile times ever recorded
in modern marathon history.

35:25.623 --> 35:28.058
Tyson is pushing some
of the best professional

35:28.159 --> 35:30.787
<i>marathon runners in the world
to their breaking point.</i>

35:33.965 --> 35:36.457
I think we should call your father
and get you home.

35:37.568 --> 35:40.265
I think we should call my mother
and get me home.

35:40.371 --> 35:42.806
My father put her number
in my cell phone, too.

35:53.084 --> 35:54.142
Tyson?

35:56.320 --> 35:58.015
Tyson, honey?

35:58.122 --> 35:59.886
- Hello, Mom.
- What are you doin' here?

35:59.991 --> 36:02.426
I am earning my new pair
of athletic footwear

36:02.527 --> 36:04.552
by helping Aklilu
organize his display,

36:04.662 --> 36:06.687
to make it more
atheistically-pleasing.

36:07.732 --> 36:09.700
Hello, Mrs. Hollerman. I'm Aklilu.

36:09.800 --> 36:13.236
Hi, nice to me you, Mr. Aklilu?

36:13.337 --> 36:16.170
- "Aklilu."
- Mr. Aklilu.

36:16.374 --> 36:18.035
- Just Aklilu.
- Okay.

36:19.977 --> 36:22.605
I'm so sorry for any trouble
my son may have caused you.

36:22.780 --> 36:24.407
Your son is no trouble at all.

36:24.515 --> 36:28.748
As a matter of fact, he's a very
fine boy and a good worker.

36:28.853 --> 36:32.084
The shoes have never been displayed
in such a neat and organized manner

36:32.190 --> 36:34.249
since the day I opened the store.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.793
He does have a way
of putting things together.

36:36.894 --> 36:38.384
Indeed, he does.

36:38.529 --> 36:40.930
We better be going, but please,
let me pay you for his shoes.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.431
That's not necessary.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.935
- Are you sure?
- I am sure, Ms. Hollerman.

36:46.237 --> 36:47.500
Well, thank you, if you insist.

36:47.605 --> 36:48.697
I do.

36:48.806 --> 36:50.797
All right, we better get goin'.

36:50.908 --> 36:52.467
Come on, Tyson, ready?

36:52.577 --> 36:55.569
- Okay, Mom.
- Okay, say "thank you" and "goodbye."

36:55.680 --> 36:57.341
Thank you and goodbye, Aklilu.

36:57.448 --> 36:58.938
Is it okay if I ask my mother

36:59.050 --> 37:01.041
if I can help you
keep your store organized

37:01.152 --> 37:04.144
and you can help me practice
to run in my new athletic shoes?

37:05.256 --> 37:06.314
No harm in askin'.

37:07.725 --> 37:11.889
Mom, is it okay with you
if I help Aklilu, and Aklilu helps me?

37:11.996 --> 37:13.293
He gave me his card.

37:14.765 --> 37:15.765
Oh. Well,

37:16.100 --> 37:19.730
we'll talk things over
with your father and see, Tyson.

37:19.837 --> 37:22.602
We will talk things over
with my father and see.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.505
So, goodbye again, Aklilu,
until I tell you, okay?

37:25.610 --> 37:27.305
Goodbye to you, my friend.

37:27.445 --> 37:28.935
So, is it okay with you, Father,

37:29.046 --> 37:32.448
if I learn how to finish ahead
of some of best runners in the world

37:32.550 --> 37:36.111
and become a champion like the boys
on your football team?

37:39.991 --> 37:43.017
Or do I still have to straighten up
all their stuff?

37:54.905 --> 37:56.805
Are you just gonna stare
at the storm all night,

37:56.907 --> 37:59.035
or are we gonna talk about this?

38:00.011 --> 38:02.378
I really don't know
what to talk about, Ellie.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.608
I mean, it seems like
all the decisions around here

38:04.715 --> 38:07.548
are gettin' made just fine
without my participation.

38:08.619 --> 38:12.078
Well, you "participate" in a sport,
Bobby, not in our family.

38:14.692 --> 38:15.716
That's not fair.

38:16.260 --> 38:19.252
Tyson wants to leave school
because of the way he's treated

38:19.363 --> 38:22.128
by the kids and the teacher.
I mean, that's what's not fair.

38:22.633 --> 38:25.068
That was a simple misunderstanding.

38:25.469 --> 38:27.267
No, he could have got hurt, Bobby.

38:27.371 --> 38:28.964
Well, what do you expect?

38:29.073 --> 38:33.670
I expect you to run interference
until Tyson finds his footing!

38:39.984 --> 38:42.476
Look, if Tyson's gonna
go out in the real world,

38:42.586 --> 38:44.816
which is what you wanted,

38:44.922 --> 38:47.584
he's gonna have to figure out
some stuff for himself.

38:47.758 --> 38:51.456
You go way above
the call of coaching duties

38:51.562 --> 38:54.031
to protect the boys who play for you.

38:54.131 --> 38:56.998
The boys who can't make the grade
or get a girl in trouble.

38:58.369 --> 39:00.428
That's different.

39:00.638 --> 39:04.006
The difference is that those boys
can win you another championship.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.808
How many trophies
is it gonna take, Bobby?

39:18.622 --> 39:21.683
I'm sorry I didn't give you
the son you wanted.

39:25.496 --> 39:26.691
Come on, Ellie.

39:30.668 --> 39:32.636
- Come on.
- Don't.

39:52.523 --> 39:54.013
Tyson!

39:55.192 --> 39:56.819
Tyson!

40:00.498 --> 40:03.092
- Tyson!
- Tyson!

40:04.769 --> 40:07.067
Bobby, he can't handle the storm!

40:15.312 --> 40:17.644
"He's 5'8" feet.
He has blue eyes.

40:17.748 --> 40:20.376
Got Sandy brown hair,
weights about 140 pounds.

40:20.484 --> 40:23.181
- Bobby, you gotta find him.
- <i>Yes, Miss.</i>

40:23.320 --> 40:25.550
- You tell him whose son he is.
- Okay.

40:25.790 --> 40:28.782
Tyson is Bobby Hollerman's son.

40:28.893 --> 40:31.726
- <i>Coach Hollerman? All right.</i>
- That's right. Coach Bobby Hollerman.

40:31.829 --> 40:33.695
<i>We have a lot of rain</i>

40:33.798 --> 40:35.425
<i>moving through
the Tri-County area now,</i>

40:35.533 --> 40:37.331
<i>all part of that tropical depression</i>

40:37.435 --> 40:39.733
<i>that is making its way up
and out of the Gulf,</i>

40:39.870 --> 40:41.133
<i>into central Georgia.</i>

40:41.305 --> 40:43.034
<i>We do have a flash flood warning...</i>

40:43.207 --> 40:44.641
Okay.

40:44.775 --> 40:47.472
Here, this was taken two years ago.

40:47.578 --> 40:49.706
He doesn't really like
having his picture taken.

40:50.581 --> 40:53.016
Do you know what he was wearing
when he left the house?

40:53.117 --> 40:54.778
As far as I can tell,
he had pajamas on

40:54.885 --> 40:56.512
and brand-new pair of running shoes.

40:56.654 --> 40:57.678
Orange.

40:58.556 --> 40:59.751
Has he ever run away before?

41:00.624 --> 41:03.059
From school yesterday,
but that was because of some teasing

41:03.160 --> 41:05.857
and a misunderstanding with
the teacher, but never from home.

41:06.030 --> 41:08.397
Is he on any specific medication

41:08.499 --> 41:10.968
or being treated for anxiety,
depression, anything like that?

41:11.068 --> 41:13.628
No. No, nothing like that.

41:13.737 --> 41:16.104
But Tyson is on the spectrum.

41:16.907 --> 41:19.069
- Spectrum?
- Autism spectrum.

41:19.810 --> 41:20.902
Oh.

41:21.545 --> 41:23.013
That's too bad.

41:23.113 --> 41:25.172
He's high-functioning,
he's got a really high IQ.

41:25.282 --> 41:27.512
It's just sometimes,
he's awkward socially.

41:28.552 --> 41:29.552
I see.

41:33.090 --> 41:34.580
Ma'am, can Tyson swim?

41:35.493 --> 41:38.986
He's not a good swimmer by any means,
but he is water-safe. We saw to that.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.159
The sooner I get this picture in play,

41:42.299 --> 41:44.597
the sooner we find your son,
and bring him back home safe.

41:44.702 --> 41:46.761
- Okay, thank you.
- Ms. Hollerman.

42:22.973 --> 42:26.034
Coach Hollerman,
my name's Sergeant Speena.

42:26.143 --> 42:27.235
Sergeant.

42:27.344 --> 42:29.779
A 911 call just came into dispatch

42:29.914 --> 42:32.815
from a woman riding around in this
looking for her cat.

42:32.917 --> 42:35.750
Said she saw a kid,
running down the middle of the road,

42:35.853 --> 42:38.254
wearing pajamas
and shiny running shoes.

42:38.355 --> 42:40.881
- Okay, where?
- Blackwater Gorge,

42:40.991 --> 42:44.325
which has gotta be more than 15 miles
from your house.

42:44.428 --> 42:46.692
Could your son have run
that far that fast?

42:46.931 --> 42:49.423
I'm not sure, Sergeant,
but I'd like to find him.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.262
Understood, sir! Follow me!

43:08.519 --> 43:11.386
<i>Looks like
he might be near Blackwater.</i>

43:11.755 --> 43:14.417
How would he have gotten
all the way out there?

43:14.658 --> 43:16.183
I don't know,
I'm with the State Police

43:16.327 --> 43:17.624
and we're on our way there.

43:18.796 --> 43:21.197
You call me the minute
you lay eyes on him, okay, Bobby?

43:21.465 --> 43:22.626
<i>Yeah, the second I spot him,</i>

43:22.800 --> 43:24.097
I promise.

43:57.568 --> 43:59.127
<i>1557, need additional units</i>

43:59.236 --> 44:00.704
<i>over at the Blackwater Gorge.</i>

44:00.804 --> 44:01.999
Tyson!

44:02.272 --> 44:03.296
Tyson!

44:03.407 --> 44:04.932
Yeah, copy that, this is...

44:05.075 --> 44:06.372
Tyson!

44:07.978 --> 44:09.070
Tyson!

44:32.636 --> 44:33.899
Tyson!

44:34.004 --> 44:35.438
Tyson!

44:37.474 --> 44:38.635
Tyson!

44:47.885 --> 44:49.353
Tyson!

44:50.587 --> 44:51.645
Tyson!

44:53.023 --> 44:55.458
Tyson!

45:23.987 --> 45:26.615
- What happened?
- A rattler got me.

45:27.891 --> 45:29.791
Hang in there.
We'll get you out of here.

45:29.993 --> 45:30.993
Over here!

45:32.029 --> 45:35.090
- What was it?
- He's snake-bit!

45:35.199 --> 45:36.724
Come on, let's carry him out of here.

45:36.834 --> 45:38.768
- Get him to the hospital.
- We got you, buddy.

45:38.869 --> 45:40.701
Come on, come on. Get up.

45:40.871 --> 45:42.430
Put your arm around me.

45:42.539 --> 45:44.633
Let's get him out. Come on.

45:44.842 --> 45:47.277
Call ahead and make sure
we got some anti-venom!

45:47.377 --> 45:49.243
What happened?

45:49.780 --> 45:51.839
A rattlesnake got one of my guys!

45:53.083 --> 45:56.519
With all this rain, these woods
are gonna be crawling with them.

45:59.923 --> 46:01.823
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to call it, Coach.

46:01.925 --> 46:03.324
Till daylight, anyway.

46:03.427 --> 46:05.191
It's just too dangerous out here
for my men.

46:05.295 --> 46:06.785
Your men? What about my boy?

46:06.897 --> 46:09.366
Look, we just don't know
that he's in here.

46:10.067 --> 46:11.466
The lady said that she saw.

46:11.568 --> 46:15.436
A kid on the road
near the entrance to the park.

46:16.073 --> 46:18.940
We have no idea,
he could've run the other way.

46:19.109 --> 46:20.599
Look, Coach, I'm sorry.

46:20.711 --> 46:23.237
Tonight was a courtesy
'cause of who you are.

46:23.380 --> 46:25.542
If your son doesn't show up
by first light,

46:25.749 --> 46:29.151
we'll organize a proper search
with as many volunteers as we can get.

46:29.753 --> 46:31.414
And I suspect there'll be a lot.

46:31.622 --> 46:34.990
But right now,
I gotta see about my man.

46:35.092 --> 46:36.582
I'm sorry, Coach.

47:04.188 --> 47:05.280
Ellie!

47:05.422 --> 47:06.856
Please tell me you found him.

47:07.057 --> 47:08.081
Not yet.

47:12.996 --> 47:15.795
Don't you dare come home
without him, Bobby.

47:17.100 --> 47:19.364
I'll call you when we find him.

47:19.469 --> 47:20.868
- Okay?
- <i>Okay.</i>

47:52.736 --> 47:54.568
- Hello.
- <i>Aklilu,</i>

47:55.105 --> 47:57.073
it's Tyson's mother.

47:58.542 --> 47:59.668
Yes, Ms. Hollerman.

47:59.977 --> 48:02.071
I apologize
for calling you at this hour,

48:02.179 --> 48:05.513
but have you, by any chance,
seen Tyson tonight?

48:05.782 --> 48:09.616
No, I haven't seen him.
Did he run away again?

48:10.354 --> 48:11.515
Yes.

48:12.422 --> 48:15.187
And I'm afraid that he's not...

48:15.592 --> 48:17.526
<i>Don't be afraid, Ms. Hollerman.</i>

48:17.828 --> 48:19.489
Tyson is a very strong boy.

48:19.596 --> 48:21.826
<i>He will find his way
until he is found.</i>

48:24.635 --> 48:26.364
What can I do to help?

48:45.355 --> 48:46.618
Tyson!

48:56.199 --> 48:57.530
Tyson!

49:04.308 --> 49:05.537
Tyson!

49:08.712 --> 49:09.838
Father.

49:09.947 --> 49:11.847
Keep calling out, son!

49:12.516 --> 49:13.642
Father.

49:14.484 --> 49:15.849
Keep calling out!

49:16.453 --> 49:20.583
Father. I am here, Father.

49:20.991 --> 49:23.187
Keep calling out!

49:23.293 --> 49:24.658
Father!

49:29.666 --> 49:31.191
Oh, my God, Tyson!

49:39.343 --> 49:40.868
Hello, Father.

49:40.978 --> 49:43.640
- Thank you for finding me.
- It's gonna be okay.

49:43.780 --> 49:45.270
I'm gonna get you out of here.

49:47.684 --> 49:49.482
But my leg is stuck.

49:49.586 --> 49:54.922
I tried very hard many times,
but I could not get it unstuck.

49:58.762 --> 50:00.821
I'm gonna need you
to hold your breath for me.

50:00.931 --> 50:02.330
Can you do that, Tyson?

50:02.566 --> 50:05.365
Yes, I can do that, Father.

50:05.669 --> 50:08.229
On the count of three, okay?

50:08.338 --> 50:10.204
You're gonna hold your breath for me,
okay?

50:10.307 --> 50:11.638
- I understand.
- Okay.

50:11.808 --> 50:13.799
Hold my breath on the count of three.

50:13.910 --> 50:17.141
One, two, three.

50:40.704 --> 50:42.695
You okay, Tyson?

50:42.906 --> 50:44.374
I'm okay, Father,

50:46.376 --> 50:48.777
but I'm very cold.

50:52.916 --> 50:57.353
Hey, I don't want you to let go of me
anymore, okay?

50:59.689 --> 51:01.350
Okay, no more letting go.

51:19.142 --> 51:20.837
Damn it!

51:23.680 --> 51:25.011
You said a bad word.

51:26.750 --> 51:27.911
I'm sorry.

51:31.188 --> 51:32.713
I'm sorry, son.

51:36.126 --> 51:37.389
Help!

51:42.099 --> 51:43.396
Somebody, help!

51:52.175 --> 51:53.233
No!

52:14.998 --> 52:16.295
Aklilu.

52:16.833 --> 52:19.029
Hello, Aklilu.

52:19.936 --> 52:23.429
His leg is pinned.
My shoulder's no good.

52:56.740 --> 52:58.799
Hi. Tyson Hollerman?

53:03.747 --> 53:06.239
- Room 264.
- 264, thanks.

53:11.922 --> 53:14.016
Hey, how is he?

53:14.124 --> 53:15.250
He's gonna be just fine.

53:15.358 --> 53:17.952
Oh, God, I don't how to thank you.

53:18.061 --> 53:20.052
You thanked me by asking for my help.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.469
Oh, my God.

53:31.274 --> 53:32.503
He's sleeping.

53:32.976 --> 53:36.037
Ellie, they gave him something,
so he could sleep.

53:37.380 --> 53:39.474
Your son is gonna be fine,
Mrs. Hollerman.

53:39.583 --> 53:41.449
- I'm Dr. Windfield.
- Hi.

53:46.189 --> 53:47.657
What happened, Bobby?

53:48.291 --> 53:51.488
A lot. But he's safe now.

53:52.262 --> 53:53.423
He's a lucky boy.

53:55.398 --> 53:57.457
If he's so lucky, why all this?

53:57.567 --> 53:59.057
He was hypothermic when he came in.

53:59.169 --> 54:02.400
We are trying to get his core
temperature back to where it belongs.

54:03.506 --> 54:06.134
- And that?
- This is precautionary.

54:06.243 --> 54:09.611
Barring any complications, he should
be ready to go home tomorrow.

54:11.381 --> 54:13.509
In the meantime, Coach,

54:14.317 --> 54:16.376
what do you say,
we get that shoulder looked at?

54:16.486 --> 54:18.045
I'll set you up with an orthopedic doc

54:18.154 --> 54:19.986
- down at ER, okay?
- Thank you.

54:26.563 --> 54:28.053
Does it hurt?

54:28.765 --> 54:30.130
It's got my attention.

54:32.335 --> 54:34.667
Gave out on me right when I needed it.

54:37.407 --> 54:39.171
Aklilu, if it wasn't for him...

54:40.076 --> 54:41.271
Tyson wouldn't be alive?

54:42.712 --> 54:44.680
I wasn't let gonna let go of him.

54:47.917 --> 54:49.612
You better go get that put right.

54:50.687 --> 54:51.848
Yeah.

54:57.961 --> 54:59.292
I'm so sorry.

55:04.801 --> 55:05.801
My baby.

55:06.903 --> 55:08.029
My baby.

55:22.152 --> 55:24.644
There's a saying among my people,

55:26.456 --> 55:30.017
"A mother's heart is held
in her hands,"

55:32.162 --> 55:35.894
a father's, deep within his chest,

55:38.068 --> 55:40.264
"swollen with pride."

55:45.241 --> 55:46.299
I don't know how.

55:48.278 --> 55:49.473
I can ever repay you.

55:52.649 --> 55:54.674
To know that a father's son is safe,

55:55.952 --> 55:57.613
is payment enough.

56:04.794 --> 56:05.989
Good night.

56:08.131 --> 56:09.131
Good night.

56:38.128 --> 56:40.825
You are doing great, Tyson.

56:41.398 --> 56:42.991
Did you hear what my nurse said?

56:43.333 --> 56:45.199
She said I am doing great.

56:45.301 --> 56:46.996
Yes, we heard, sweetheart.

56:48.438 --> 56:51.772
Well, as soon as the doctor
signs your discharge paperwork,

56:51.941 --> 56:54.569
then you all can take him home.
Won't be but a couple of minutes.

56:55.078 --> 56:56.705
We appreciate you. Thank you.

56:57.914 --> 57:00.110
The pleasure is all ours.

57:00.216 --> 57:03.948
And we're all rooting for you to take
the title again this year, Coach.

57:04.087 --> 57:05.555
Thank you, ma'am.

57:05.922 --> 57:07.822
- Bye, Tyson.
- Goodbye.

57:09.125 --> 57:10.786
- Take care.
- Thank you.

57:11.828 --> 57:14.229
We thank you for this food
we are about to receive

57:14.431 --> 57:15.728
and for seeing us through.

57:17.267 --> 57:21.966
And allowing us to bring home our son
safe and sound.

57:22.071 --> 57:23.071
- Amen.
- Amen.

57:23.139 --> 57:24.163
Amen.

57:34.184 --> 57:36.551
Even though I didn't do such
a good job running in the rain,

57:36.653 --> 57:38.280
I still want to learn how to run

57:38.421 --> 57:42.415
and finish ahead of some of the best
runners in the world on a certain day.

57:42.525 --> 57:43.890
And I know what day that is.

57:44.961 --> 57:45.985
You do?

57:46.362 --> 57:49.525
The day of the first
Stand bridge annual marathon.

57:49.632 --> 57:52.158
Mayor Coleman says it's going to help
put our city on the map

57:52.368 --> 57:54.063
and make it greater than ever.

57:54.737 --> 57:57.707
If I earn new athletic shoes
and practice with Aklilu,

57:57.807 --> 58:00.139
I can beat some of the best
runners in the world

58:00.276 --> 58:03.871
during the marathon
and help put our city on the map.

58:03.980 --> 58:07.473
And I could be a champion
like the boys on your team, Father.

58:08.985 --> 58:11.750
A marathon is a very, very long race.

58:13.857 --> 58:16.224
Twenty-six miles, 385 yards.

58:18.461 --> 58:22.295
It takes a special kind of runner
with a lot of training,

58:23.566 --> 58:26.763
to even compete
in a very long race like that.

58:27.403 --> 58:29.030
You understand?

58:31.007 --> 58:33.339
Well, I could be a special
kind of runner, Father.

58:34.777 --> 58:36.211
And when I am a champion,

58:36.312 --> 58:38.337
maybe I can even
become the son you wanted,

58:38.548 --> 58:41.279
and then you and my mother
wouldn't argue about me anymore.

58:41.885 --> 58:43.944
Tyson, sweetheart.

58:45.021 --> 58:46.580
I'm so sorry

58:47.624 --> 58:51.117
if you heard anything
that hurt your feelings.

58:51.227 --> 58:52.490
We didn't mean it.

58:52.795 --> 58:55.355
Sometimes, people say things
that they don't mean.

58:58.468 --> 59:00.163
People make mistakes, son.

59:03.072 --> 59:06.007
But you're not just people,
you're my parents.

59:10.580 --> 59:12.639
So, can Aklilu help me
to win the marathon?

59:14.384 --> 59:15.584
Or do I still have to help you

59:15.685 --> 59:18.711
straighten up
all your players' stuff, Father?

59:22.625 --> 59:24.559
We'll call Aklilu tomorrow, okay?

59:25.695 --> 59:26.695
Okay.

59:42.545 --> 59:46.106
Why didn't you just tell him
to build a spaceship in the backyard,

59:46.215 --> 59:48.081
and make it fly to the Moon?

59:48.818 --> 59:52.277
You know what? I'd rather tell him
he can than he can't.

59:53.389 --> 59:55.414
Look, Ellie,
I don't want to argue with you.

59:55.525 --> 59:58.392
He has unrealistic goals of greatness.

1:00:01.631 --> 1:00:05.499
The reality is,
every dream is not for every boy.

1:00:06.302 --> 1:00:08.361
What do you think, Bobby,
he's like Pinocchio,

1:00:08.471 --> 1:00:10.838
that one day,
he's gonna magically wake up and be

1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:12.408
more real than he already is?

1:00:15.845 --> 1:00:18.007
I'm raising him by myself here.

1:00:23.353 --> 1:00:25.515
Things have got to change.

1:00:31.327 --> 1:00:33.091
I'm keepin' this child.

1:00:44.741 --> 1:00:46.300
Let's make a deal.

1:00:47.910 --> 1:00:53.110
You fight and your daddy
will always fight for you.

1:01:03.092 --> 1:01:05.288
<i>I'm keepin' this child.</i>

1:01:06.829 --> 1:01:09.196
Hey, Coach,
team's on the field and ready for you.

1:01:15.571 --> 1:01:16.663
Coach?

1:01:22.111 --> 1:01:23.943
Hey, Daryl. Come in.

1:01:27.950 --> 1:01:29.679
Yeah, what's up, Coach?

1:01:30.853 --> 1:01:32.082
Well...

1:01:36.592 --> 1:01:38.492
I want you to take over the team.

1:01:39.395 --> 1:01:42.524
I figured you needed a couple of days
after what happened, so...

1:01:43.466 --> 1:01:44.627
For the entire season.

1:01:46.636 --> 1:01:49.503
I don't understand, Coach.
What about state?

1:01:49.772 --> 1:01:50.898
The team needs you.

1:01:51.974 --> 1:01:53.339
My family needs me.

1:01:54.877 --> 1:01:57.869
And I need my family,
so, what do you say?

1:01:59.415 --> 1:02:02.578
Yeah. Sure, Coach. I'm in.

1:02:03.319 --> 1:02:04.377
Good.

1:02:18.434 --> 1:02:21.426
You wouldn't happen
to have a pair of 10.5

1:02:21.537 --> 1:02:22.868
in orange, would you?

1:02:56.973 --> 1:02:59.067
So, Jesus said to them,

1:02:59.976 --> 1:03:02.604
"Truly, truly, I say to you,"

1:03:04.914 --> 1:03:07.508
the Son can do nothin'
of his own accord,

1:03:09.752 --> 1:03:11.982
but only what
he sees his Father doing.

1:03:14.791 --> 1:03:19.058
"For whatever the Father does,
that the Son does likewise."

1:03:20.463 --> 1:03:21.726
John 5:19.

1:03:22.298 --> 1:03:24.960
Simply put, like father like son.

1:03:28.171 --> 1:03:32.301
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but what kinda name is Aklilu?

1:03:32.775 --> 1:03:34.675
Aklilu is a Ethiopian name.

1:03:34.811 --> 1:03:36.301
I'm a Somali-Ethiopian.

1:03:36.512 --> 1:03:38.207
How long have you been in the US?

1:03:38.314 --> 1:03:40.783
- Almost ten years.
- Do you miss home?

1:03:41.083 --> 1:03:42.778
I find I could do more for my family

1:03:42.885 --> 1:03:46.185
and my village by bein' here,
than bein' there.

1:03:46.389 --> 1:03:47.413
So, I am here.

1:03:47.557 --> 1:03:49.616
Do boys kiss girls in Africa, Aklilu?

1:03:50.793 --> 1:03:54.024
And if boys kiss girls in Africa,
did you ever kiss a girl?

1:03:54.130 --> 1:03:56.326
And if you ever kissed a girl,
did you like it?

1:03:56.933 --> 1:03:59.766
Tyson, let's let Aklilu
enjoy his meal.

1:04:00.069 --> 1:04:01.798
I will let Aklilu enjoy his meal.

1:04:02.738 --> 1:04:04.729
But when he is done enjoying his meal,

1:04:04.841 --> 1:04:07.833
I have a lot of questions
to ask him about kissing girls.

1:04:12.915 --> 1:04:15.247
Remember stay to the right,
okay, honey?

1:04:15.351 --> 1:04:17.786
I will remember to stay
all the way to the right.

1:04:17.887 --> 1:04:19.912
- Ellie, Ellie.
- Hmm?

1:04:20.056 --> 1:04:22.650
- He's gonna be fine.
- Okay, okay.

1:04:24.293 --> 1:04:27.593
Tyson, stay to the right.

1:04:28.397 --> 1:04:31.025
I'm going to remember
to stay to the right.

1:04:33.402 --> 1:04:36.838
This will help you stay on pace.

1:04:37.874 --> 1:04:39.273
It's splendiferous.

1:04:40.209 --> 1:04:41.267
Thank you, Aklilu.

1:04:42.178 --> 1:04:43.270
You're welcome.

1:04:43.713 --> 1:04:46.705
Stay relaxed,
and remember your breathing.

1:04:47.617 --> 1:04:50.314
Now, let's see how far
you can go in two hours.

1:04:50.419 --> 1:04:52.285
Let's see how far I can go.

1:04:52.388 --> 1:04:53.388
Start running.

1:04:53.522 --> 1:04:55.684
- Now?
- Now.

1:05:08.905 --> 1:05:12.136
- Don't lose him, Bobby.
- He's fine, Ellie.

1:05:13.476 --> 1:05:16.707
I don't know
if this is such a good idea.

1:05:16.812 --> 1:05:18.337
He's fine, Ms. Hollerman.

1:05:29.558 --> 1:05:32.289
Are you sure
he's not going too fast?

1:05:33.362 --> 1:05:35.694
Tyson does not
place limits on himself,

1:05:35.798 --> 1:05:38.631
so, no limits should be placed
upon him.

1:06:13.469 --> 1:06:16.734
- It's time for his water.
- Okay.

1:06:29.218 --> 1:06:30.515
Hello, Aklilu.

1:06:30.619 --> 1:06:32.109
- Don't speak.
- How are you?

1:06:32.254 --> 1:06:33.779
Just drink.

1:06:36.125 --> 1:06:39.186
Drink slowly and not too much.

1:06:40.629 --> 1:06:43.326
Even though you told me not to speak,

1:06:45.067 --> 1:06:47.035
is it okay if I say "thank you?"

1:06:47.236 --> 1:06:48.294
No.

1:06:49.538 --> 1:06:52.701
Okay, I will not say "thank you."

1:07:06.322 --> 1:07:07.414
What?

1:07:16.065 --> 1:07:17.065
Anyone?

1:07:18.334 --> 1:07:19.392
Tyson.

1:07:19.602 --> 1:07:21.900
One language is not enough nowadays.

1:07:36.118 --> 1:07:37.916
Thank you, everybody. Have a good day.

1:07:39.989 --> 1:07:41.855
So, I was thinking that maybe we could

1:07:41.991 --> 1:07:44.119
sit next to each other in
all the classes together,

1:07:44.226 --> 1:07:46.888
if you're cool with that,
especially in algebra.

1:07:46.996 --> 1:07:49.795
I could totally use whatever extra
brain cells you can spare.

1:07:52.234 --> 1:07:53.895
That doesn't make any sense.

1:07:54.070 --> 1:07:55.196
I know, right?

1:07:56.072 --> 1:07:59.098
I have a question.
Are you my girlfriend now?

1:08:00.443 --> 1:08:01.569
Not yet.

1:08:01.677 --> 1:08:04.203
Not curving you. But not yet.

1:08:10.486 --> 1:08:12.887
Why don't you say
grace tonight, Tyson?

1:08:14.290 --> 1:08:16.554
Okay, Father, I will say the grace.

1:08:19.295 --> 1:08:21.764
Thank you for this food
we are about to receive,

1:08:21.931 --> 1:08:23.899
and for Aklilu, and for the marathon

1:08:23.999 --> 1:08:25.524
that's going to make me
into a champion

1:08:25.634 --> 1:08:27.159
and put our city on the map.

1:08:27.269 --> 1:08:29.294
And for my mother and father
letting me do.

1:08:29.872 --> 1:08:30.872
Amen.

1:08:30.940 --> 1:08:32.669
- Amen.
- Amen.

1:08:33.742 --> 1:08:35.369
That was nice, Tyson.

1:09:44.914 --> 1:09:47.975
The nuchal translucency looks good.

1:09:48.350 --> 1:09:52.344
We'll have to have a CMA done
to determine the degree of risk

1:09:52.588 --> 1:09:53.953
for autism.

1:09:54.790 --> 1:09:55.882
CMA?

1:09:56.625 --> 1:10:00.289
Chromosomal micro array analysis.

1:10:01.263 --> 1:10:05.063
It's non-invasive,
so, it's not as scary as it sounds,

1:10:05.167 --> 1:10:07.192
but it wouldn't indicate

1:10:07.303 --> 1:10:10.295
where on the spectrum
the child might fall,

1:10:10.472 --> 1:10:13.567
if there are signs of autism.

1:10:15.644 --> 1:10:17.009
We don't need the test.

1:10:21.150 --> 1:10:24.017
Well, then so far, so good.

1:10:27.389 --> 1:10:29.153
Do you wanna know what you're having?

1:10:29.825 --> 1:10:32.658
Well, I think we already know.

1:10:32.761 --> 1:10:34.889
Another beautiful child.

1:10:41.070 --> 1:10:42.435
I want to see power here.

1:10:42.571 --> 1:10:44.903
Three, two, one, shoot.

1:10:46.575 --> 1:10:49.010
Get up, come on, we're not dancin'.
We're not dancin'.

1:10:49.111 --> 1:10:51.671
You wanna dance,
you ask somebody to prom, let's go.

1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:53.974
Coach, our readers want to know.

1:10:54.283 --> 1:10:57.014
With an unprecedented,
record-breaking season on the line,

1:10:57.152 --> 1:10:59.348
why did you make the decide
to step down as head coach

1:10:59.488 --> 1:11:01.752
of arguably the best
high school football team

1:11:01.857 --> 1:11:04.189
in the state
and one of the best in the nation?

1:11:04.293 --> 1:11:05.783
It's simple. Priorities.

1:11:06.495 --> 1:11:09.396
So, is it fair to say that you're
putting family ahead of football?

1:11:09.531 --> 1:11:12.125
Fair to say,
I put my family first, yeah.

1:11:12.401 --> 1:11:14.495
"Family first."
I may quote you on that, Coach.

1:11:14.603 --> 1:11:17.368
- Thank you for your time.
- You got it.

1:11:30.986 --> 1:11:33.148
Watch it, guys, watch it goin' inside!

1:11:38.127 --> 1:11:39.561
Goin! Goin!

1:11:40.095 --> 1:11:41.585
Go in!

1:11:42.164 --> 1:11:43.188
He's goin' in!

1:11:43.332 --> 1:11:44.332
Goin' in!

1:11:44.433 --> 1:11:45.594
Come on, come on! Yes!

1:11:47.269 --> 1:11:48.293
Yeah!

1:11:48.404 --> 1:11:51.169
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
that is your ball game.</i>

1:11:51.273 --> 1:11:54.538
<i>Final score,
Greyhounds 16, Trojans 14.</i>

1:12:32.681 --> 1:12:33.978
I hope it's a girl.

1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:40.487
I hope it's a girl
and she's just like her mother.

1:12:42.491 --> 1:12:43.515
Me, too.

1:12:49.231 --> 1:12:50.699
You really want a girl?

1:12:52.634 --> 1:12:54.602
I already got my son.

1:13:15.324 --> 1:13:16.416
Come in.

1:13:17.092 --> 1:13:19.151
Sir? Mr. Hollerman.

1:13:20.062 --> 1:13:21.461
Hey, good morning.

1:13:21.730 --> 1:13:23.494
Morning, Mr. Mayor.

1:13:23.599 --> 1:13:25.931
Appreciate you coming, Coach.
Have a seat.

1:13:28.871 --> 1:13:32.239
- May I call you Bobby?
- I've been called worse.

1:13:34.076 --> 1:13:35.737
Haven't we all?

1:13:40.015 --> 1:13:42.882
All right, I gotta say,
like everybody else in this town,

1:13:42.985 --> 1:13:45.477
I was shocked to learn that
you wouldn't be leading our team

1:13:45.587 --> 1:13:46.884
to another state championship.

1:13:46.989 --> 1:13:50.050
I'm sure there's more important issues
comin' across your desk

1:13:50.159 --> 1:13:53.026
than who is coaching
the high school football team.

1:13:53.862 --> 1:13:55.296
So, what can I do for you?

1:13:55.464 --> 1:13:56.795
Your son.

1:13:57.266 --> 1:13:58.290
My son?

1:13:58.934 --> 1:14:01.631
Yeah, I heard about that business
over at Blackwater Gorge.

1:14:02.704 --> 1:14:03.704
That's a real shame.

1:14:04.907 --> 1:14:06.841
My son might have some challenges,

1:14:06.942 --> 1:14:08.876
but it's nothing
that we are ashamed of.

1:14:09.778 --> 1:14:11.371
I meant no offense.

1:14:12.414 --> 1:14:13.540
Yeah.

1:14:13.715 --> 1:14:16.616
It's hard to keep up nowadays,
with what's politically correct

1:14:16.718 --> 1:14:19.779
when referring
to those among us who are...

1:14:20.756 --> 1:14:21.848
different.

1:14:23.692 --> 1:14:27.526
A good place to start might be
not calling them "different."

1:14:28.330 --> 1:14:29.957
Point well taken.

1:14:31.500 --> 1:14:33.298
So you wanna tell me
what I'm doin' here?

1:14:33.402 --> 1:14:34.699
Yeah, let me cut to the chase.

1:14:37.339 --> 1:14:40.331
I think it would be best if your son
did not run in my marathon.

1:14:41.143 --> 1:14:43.510
Nothing personal, but
the focus should be on the race itself

1:14:43.612 --> 1:14:45.239
and not on Coach Hollerman's kid.

1:14:45.747 --> 1:14:47.078
I can't afford to have this thing

1:14:47.182 --> 1:14:49.844
turned into some
social cause or crusade

1:14:49.985 --> 1:14:52.784
for the mentally-handicapped.
You catch my drift?

1:14:54.256 --> 1:14:56.623
I mean, they have special events
for kids just like yours.

1:14:56.825 --> 1:14:59.487
Heck, they even have
their own Olympics.

1:14:59.595 --> 1:15:01.290
So, why don't you
just do right by your kid

1:15:01.396 --> 1:15:04.525
and have him earn a ribbon

1:15:04.633 --> 1:15:07.000
or get an atta-boy badge
doin' something like that?

1:15:07.703 --> 1:15:12.368
My son is gonna run in your race
whether you like it or not.

1:15:13.208 --> 1:15:15.643
But it's not just my race,
it's my city. You...

1:15:16.778 --> 1:15:20.009
Not for much longer if you try
to stop my boy from running.

1:15:21.717 --> 1:15:24.209
Okay, well, that sounds
an awful lot like a threat.

1:15:24.419 --> 1:15:28.117
Well, if I announce my candidacy
for the fall election,

1:15:28.357 --> 1:15:32.260
and that's threatening to you,
then yeah, maybe it is a threat.

1:15:32.861 --> 1:15:36.764
I am pretty popular
around these parts.

1:15:39.701 --> 1:15:41.066
All right.

1:15:41.803 --> 1:15:43.532
If you wanna have your son run a race

1:15:43.639 --> 1:15:45.334
that he's not even
gonna be able to finish,

1:15:45.440 --> 1:15:48.102
let alone win, you knock yourself out.

1:15:49.177 --> 1:15:51.373
But you keep him and that drug-takin',

1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:54.450
blood-dopin', sneaker salesman
that you got trainin' him,

1:15:54.816 --> 1:15:58.309
yeah, away from my cameras
and the real runners.

1:15:59.454 --> 1:16:01.980
Like I said, Coach, it's my city.

1:16:02.925 --> 1:16:04.484
I think we're done here.

1:16:14.336 --> 1:16:15.462
Hi, Tyson.

1:16:16.204 --> 1:16:17.204
Hi, Shannon.

1:16:17.539 --> 1:16:21.134
Heard they wrote about you
in the newspaper. That's lit.

1:16:23.278 --> 1:16:24.541
Good luck in the race.

1:16:24.646 --> 1:16:26.740
Yeah, sorry for the way
we treated you.

1:16:32.054 --> 1:16:33.920
Hey, Forrest Chump!

1:16:40.295 --> 1:16:42.593
I don't care
who your father used to be,

1:16:43.665 --> 1:16:45.064
you're goin' down.

1:16:45.167 --> 1:16:47.158
I care who his father is.

1:16:47.269 --> 1:16:48.566
If I were you, butt-for-faces,

1:16:48.670 --> 1:16:51.037
I'd go sit back down
before you got knocked down.

1:16:56.511 --> 1:16:59.572
Hey, good luck in the marathon, Tyson.
Whole team's rootin' for you.

1:16:59.982 --> 1:17:02.076
Well, thank you and the whole team.

1:17:03.051 --> 1:17:07.454
And good luck winning the championship
without my father being your coach.

1:17:07.823 --> 1:17:09.791
- He means that...
- No, I know, I know.

1:17:42.290 --> 1:17:43.587
Hello, Father.

1:17:44.993 --> 1:17:47.223
Aklilu and I ran a half-marathon,

1:17:47.329 --> 1:17:51.357
which is 13 miles, 192.5 yards,

1:17:51.466 --> 1:17:54.197
and Aklilu said I ran extremely well.

1:17:54.336 --> 1:17:55.929
You go in the house, Tyson.

1:18:00.275 --> 1:18:01.743
Go on, do as you're told.

1:18:01.843 --> 1:18:03.902
Come inside
and take your shower, Tyson.

1:18:11.653 --> 1:18:12.848
Come on.

1:18:14.623 --> 1:18:16.682
I appreciate everything
you've done for Tyson,

1:18:17.592 --> 1:18:19.924
but I think it's best
if I take it from here.

1:18:28.070 --> 1:18:29.333
May I ask why?

1:18:30.739 --> 1:18:33.037
I don't want you spendin'
any more time with my son.

1:18:34.810 --> 1:18:36.904
Let's just leave it at that.

1:19:08.677 --> 1:19:10.008
Tyson?

1:19:11.980 --> 1:19:13.072
Tyson!

1:19:24.059 --> 1:19:25.059
Tyson!

1:19:26.795 --> 1:19:27.887
Tyson!

1:19:32.501 --> 1:19:34.970
Well, he's gettin' faster,
I'll give him that.

1:20:00.862 --> 1:20:02.887
It'll be dark soon.

1:20:02.998 --> 1:20:04.591
We'll find him.

1:20:20.448 --> 1:20:22.007
Hello, Aklilu.

1:20:24.319 --> 1:20:27.186
Running, and running away

1:20:27.289 --> 1:20:30.088
are two very different things,
my friend.

1:20:33.695 --> 1:20:35.663
Why didn't you stay for dinner?

1:20:36.598 --> 1:20:38.760
Did my father say something rude,

1:20:38.867 --> 1:20:42.030
hurtful or distasteful
when he was speaking to you?

1:20:42.137 --> 1:20:45.869
Is that why you didn't stay for dinner
and left without saying goodbye?

1:20:45.974 --> 1:20:49.877
Your father was not rude,
he was honest.

1:20:50.679 --> 1:20:52.306
Honest about what?

1:20:53.648 --> 1:20:55.639
Honest about how he feels.

1:21:00.155 --> 1:21:02.852
I don't understand, Aklilu.

1:21:02.991 --> 1:21:05.187
How my father feels about what?

1:21:08.897 --> 1:21:11.867
How he feels about his son.

1:21:15.804 --> 1:21:16.896
Tyson.

1:21:19.007 --> 1:21:21.635
Tyson, are you okay?

1:21:21.743 --> 1:21:23.211
I'm okay.

1:21:25.413 --> 1:21:28.110
Father, what feelings
were you honest about

1:21:28.216 --> 1:21:30.048
with Aklilu that made him leave

1:21:30.151 --> 1:21:32.643
and not stay for dinner
or say goodbye?

1:21:32.754 --> 1:21:34.916
We'll talk about it at home. Let's go.

1:21:36.057 --> 1:21:37.057
No!

1:21:37.192 --> 1:21:38.250
Tyson.

1:21:38.560 --> 1:21:40.927
I want to know what
my father's honest feelings are,

1:21:41.029 --> 1:21:42.929
and why they made Aklilu
not have dinner with us

1:21:43.031 --> 1:21:44.226
or say goodbye to me.

1:21:47.035 --> 1:21:50.938
Perhaps, it would be best
if you talk about it here.

1:21:51.039 --> 1:21:52.734
I'll make tea.

1:22:01.249 --> 1:22:04.014
The New York Marathon
was my last race.

1:22:06.121 --> 1:22:07.680
Why, Aklilu?

1:22:07.789 --> 1:22:09.814
Because he didn't
play by the rules, Tyson.

1:22:12.527 --> 1:22:15.428
Does that mean you cheated, Aklilu?

1:22:17.966 --> 1:22:21.163
The day of the race,
I woke up with a cold.

1:22:21.269 --> 1:22:23.897
I considered pullin' out of the race,

1:22:24.606 --> 1:22:27.439
but there was big prize money
for the winner.

1:22:28.243 --> 1:22:30.769
So, you cheated to get money?

1:22:31.379 --> 1:22:35.577
I sent half of all my winnings
to my family and my village.

1:22:36.885 --> 1:22:40.685
But cheating is
like not telling the truth.

1:22:40.789 --> 1:22:43.224
It's always wrong,
no matter the reason.

1:22:46.494 --> 1:22:51.261
I took a cold medicine before the race
for my congestion.

1:22:53.168 --> 1:22:57.230
After I had won the marathon,
I was drug-tested.

1:22:57.806 --> 1:23:01.174
A banned substance
in the cold medicine

1:23:01.276 --> 1:23:04.871
was detected in my blood
and I was disqualified.

1:23:06.114 --> 1:23:10.483
But that's not fair.
You just made a mistake.

1:23:10.585 --> 1:23:12.713
People make mistakes.

1:23:12.821 --> 1:23:14.880
Tyson, if you don't play by the rules,

1:23:15.123 --> 1:23:18.218
it's not fair to the honest athletes.

1:23:18.326 --> 1:23:19.326
Bobby.

1:23:20.495 --> 1:23:23.795
It's okay, Ms. Hollerman.
Your father is right, Tyson.

1:23:23.898 --> 1:23:27.198
It was my responsibility to know
what was in the medicine.

1:23:28.470 --> 1:23:29.938
I couldn't understand the label.

1:23:30.305 --> 1:23:33.331
That's because you ran away
from English class,

1:23:33.441 --> 1:23:35.466
like how I ran away
from Spanish class.

1:23:35.710 --> 1:23:37.678
Why didn't you explain this earlier?

1:23:37.779 --> 1:23:39.838
You did not want an explanation.

1:23:42.350 --> 1:23:45.012
Well, we owe you an apology, Aklilu.

1:23:45.253 --> 1:23:49.451
I am owed nothing.
Your son is owed something.

1:23:51.526 --> 1:23:53.688
What am I owed, Aklilu?

1:23:55.296 --> 1:23:56.730
A chance.

1:24:00.735 --> 1:24:02.464
Do you think Aklilu will come?

1:24:02.570 --> 1:24:03.799
He might, Tyson.

1:24:03.905 --> 1:24:07.034
I guess Shannon won't be here,
because she is not my girlfriend yet.

1:24:07.142 --> 1:24:09.736
Oh, I wouldn't be surprised
if she was here somewhere.

1:24:09.844 --> 1:24:11.141
I think everybody in this town

1:24:11.246 --> 1:24:14.238
who isn't runnin' in the race
is watching the race, sweetheart.

1:24:15.650 --> 1:24:18.779
Well, I don't want you
and my father to watch me race.

1:24:19.054 --> 1:24:21.523
Why, Tyson? Why would you say that?

1:24:22.223 --> 1:24:24.590
I want you to go wait
at the finish line,

1:24:24.692 --> 1:24:26.990
so you can watch me win.

1:24:27.529 --> 1:24:29.088
Tyson, I just want you to concentrate

1:24:29.197 --> 1:24:31.359
on running your own race
at your own pace,

1:24:31.466 --> 1:24:33.264
don't worry
about your mother and me,

1:24:33.368 --> 1:24:36.736
we'll be at the finish line
no matter when you cross, okay?

1:24:36.838 --> 1:24:38.135
Okay, Father.

1:24:38.239 --> 1:24:41.038
I will concentrate on running
my own race at my own pace.

1:24:43.011 --> 1:24:44.103
Okay, how do we...

1:24:44.212 --> 1:24:46.078
I really wish Aklilu was here.

1:24:50.852 --> 1:24:51.944
Yeah, we should go.

1:24:54.556 --> 1:24:57.184
<i>Ladies and Gentleman,
I wanna welcome you</i>

1:24:57.292 --> 1:25:01.559
<i>to the first annual
Stand bridge City Marathon!</i>

1:25:06.601 --> 1:25:08.126
<i>All right, all right.</i>

1:25:08.236 --> 1:25:12.195
<i>Elite runners,
take your Mark, get set...</i>

1:25:22.450 --> 1:25:24.942
<i>All right, let's get it goin'.</i>

1:25:32.293 --> 1:25:33.351
Come on, go, dude!

1:25:33.461 --> 1:25:35.293
- Come on.
- Hey, watch out, man.

1:25:35.396 --> 1:25:37.194
- Get out of the way.
- Out of the way!

1:25:37.465 --> 1:25:39.729
I knew he's gonna
turn this thing into a circus.

1:25:39.834 --> 1:25:40.834
<i>All right!</i>

1:25:41.302 --> 1:25:42.861
Where is he?

1:25:43.605 --> 1:25:45.767
I don't know, I don't see him.

1:25:51.112 --> 1:25:52.511
<i>Can you teach me to run</i>

1:25:52.614 --> 1:25:55.379
<i>and finish ahead of some
of the best runners in the world</i>

1:25:55.483 --> 1:25:57.383
<i>on a certain day?</i>

1:25:59.454 --> 1:26:02.754
<i>I can help you
to know how to run,</i>

1:26:03.525 --> 1:26:07.325
<i>but it's up to you
where and how you finish.</i>

1:26:07.562 --> 1:26:09.462
Run!

1:26:11.132 --> 1:26:13.032
<i>Up to me.</i>

1:26:33.288 --> 1:26:35.484
<i>Give it up for 'em,
give it up for 'em now!</i>

1:26:38.226 --> 1:26:40.820
Come on, let's go,
we might have missed him.

1:27:02.050 --> 1:27:03.882
You're a generous pourer, Clara.

1:27:03.985 --> 1:27:05.384
You're very welcome.

1:27:07.755 --> 1:27:09.245
<i>Here we are</i>

1:27:09.390 --> 1:27:13.293
<i>and the elite runners have
Just passed the five-mile Mark.</i>

1:27:13.394 --> 1:27:14.394
<i>How are they doin'?</i>

1:27:14.529 --> 1:27:16.129
Well, it's early in the race
yet to tell,

1:27:16.231 --> 1:27:18.290
but considering
the unexpected warm temperatures,

1:27:18.399 --> 1:27:20.834
and humidity index,
they are doing really quite well.

1:27:20.935 --> 1:27:24.394
They finished the first five miles
in 23 minutes and 11 seconds,

1:27:24.505 --> 1:27:26.132
which is sub five-minute miles.

1:27:26.241 --> 1:27:27.800
Can the runners keep up that pace?

1:27:27.909 --> 1:27:30.139
One of them will have to
or even pick up that pace

1:27:30.245 --> 1:27:32.111
if they wanna cross
the line ahead of the rest.

1:27:32.213 --> 1:27:33.840
Well, we still have a long way to go,

1:27:33.948 --> 1:27:37.316
but this could be a very
exciting finish. And I know you...

1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:54.095
Tyson!

1:27:54.435 --> 1:27:56.028
Don't stop, idiot!

1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:01.169
How far do you think he is?

1:28:01.276 --> 1:28:03.244
If he's running
at his practice pace,

1:28:03.344 --> 1:28:05.312
he should've been at mile nine.

1:28:28.903 --> 1:28:30.997
<i>Tyson,
I just want you to concentrate</i>

1:28:31.105 --> 1:28:34.370
<i>on running your own race
at your own pace.</i>

1:28:34.475 --> 1:28:37.069
<i>I will concentrate
on running my own race</i>

1:28:37.178 --> 1:28:38.873
<i>at my own pace.</i>

1:28:53.328 --> 1:28:56.320
Where once there were ten,
now at the halfway point,

1:28:56.431 --> 1:28:58.763
there are three. Explain.

1:28:59.033 --> 1:29:00.033
It's simple, really.

1:29:00.134 --> 1:29:02.330
Right now,
we're seeing the best of the best.

1:29:02.437 --> 1:29:05.429
Unless something unforeseen happens,
we're likely looking at our champion,

1:29:05.540 --> 1:29:07.838
but only time will tell
which one of the three it will be.

1:29:21.189 --> 1:29:25.888
<i>Stay relaxed
and remember your breathing.</i>

1:29:33.568 --> 1:29:36.401
Excuse us, excuse us.
Sorry, we're lookin' for our son.

1:29:36.504 --> 1:29:39.132
- Everybody's got somebody in the race.
- Okay, sorry.

1:29:43.578 --> 1:29:44.636
There he is!

1:29:47.648 --> 1:29:49.241
He's bleeding, Bobby, he's hurt.

1:29:49.350 --> 1:29:50.977
Look at his knee!

1:29:55.223 --> 1:29:57.317
- Tyson!
- Let him do.

1:29:57.425 --> 1:29:58.449
Aklilu!

1:29:58.593 --> 1:30:02.621
Every runner has one perfect run.
This is Tyson's run.

1:30:03.064 --> 1:30:04.293
El, let's go, come on.

1:30:04.399 --> 1:30:07.027
- Where are we goin'?
- We're gonna go to the finish line.

1:30:18.780 --> 1:30:22.148
<i>All right,
we play like we practice!</i>

1:30:22.250 --> 1:30:24.878
<i>We play like we practice!</i>

1:30:27.355 --> 1:30:28.447
Six miles left.

1:30:28.556 --> 1:30:30.923
What should we be looking for
from this point on?

1:30:31.025 --> 1:30:32.493
How they handle the wall.

1:30:32.894 --> 1:30:35.761
The wall? Can you elaborate
on that term for our viewers

1:30:35.863 --> 1:30:37.297
who may not be familiar?

1:30:37.398 --> 1:30:39.093
The wall is the point in a marathon

1:30:39.200 --> 1:30:41.430
where the runners
have depleted their glycogen,

1:30:41.536 --> 1:30:44.096
and that's the sugar
that your muscles use for energy,

1:30:44.205 --> 1:30:46.936
and once it is depleted,
the body has to turn to burning fat.

1:30:47.041 --> 1:30:50.204
But that transition takes time
and the tank is empty

1:30:50.311 --> 1:30:51.676
until that transition is made.

1:30:51.979 --> 1:30:54.505
This stops many runners
at about the 20-mile Mark.

1:30:54.615 --> 1:30:55.615
I see.

1:31:05.092 --> 1:31:06.092
Tyson!

1:31:08.863 --> 1:31:10.194
Here, drink.

1:31:15.102 --> 1:31:16.831
Are you my girlfriend yet?

1:31:44.031 --> 1:31:45.624
Yep.

1:31:48.269 --> 1:31:49.269
Keep goin'.

1:31:50.304 --> 1:31:51.703
Don't quit.

1:31:57.011 --> 1:31:58.308
I'm getting word,

1:31:58.412 --> 1:32:01.712
that there is a development about
a mile behind the elite runners

1:32:01.816 --> 1:32:05.116
that's worth noting,
so, let's go there live.

1:32:19.367 --> 1:32:21.927
<i>And this young man
you're looking at now, is the son</i>

1:32:22.036 --> 1:32:24.801
<i>of renowned high school
football coach Bobby Hollerman,</i>

1:32:24.906 --> 1:32:26.271
Tyson Hollerman.

1:32:26.374 --> 1:32:28.365
He's only 15 years old.

1:32:28.476 --> 1:32:32.435
He's running
in his very first marathon.

1:32:32.547 --> 1:32:34.413
That can't be right.

1:32:37.151 --> 1:32:40.246
All right. The official time
for young Tyson

1:32:40.354 --> 1:32:44.120
for the last two miles,
nine minutes flat.

1:32:44.258 --> 1:32:47.353
If that's true,
that is an extraordinary time.

1:32:47.495 --> 1:32:49.156
It'd be almost world-record pace.

1:32:49.263 --> 1:32:53.029
Yeah, absolutely.
Even at my best, I couldn't do that.

1:33:13.287 --> 1:33:17.485
<i>A marathon
is a very, very long race.</i>

1:33:21.262 --> 1:33:23.822
<i>It takes a very special kind of runner</i>

1:33:23.931 --> 1:33:27.196
<i>with a lot of training to even compete</i>

1:33:27.301 --> 1:33:29.668
<i>in a very long race like that.</i>

1:33:29.770 --> 1:33:31.033
<i>You understand?</i>

1:33:33.941 --> 1:33:37.536
<i>Well, I could be
a special kind of runner, Father.</i>

1:33:42.783 --> 1:33:47.380
Only two and a half miles to go,
can he do it?

1:33:47.488 --> 1:33:50.981
Can mighty Tyson Hollerman
pull off a miracle,

1:33:51.092 --> 1:33:53.459
make his Mark in marathon history?

1:33:53.561 --> 1:33:57.930
A history that dates back
over 2,500 years.

1:34:00.101 --> 1:34:02.331
Uh, frankly, I just don't see how.

1:34:02.436 --> 1:34:03.995
If the leaders
maintain their pace,

1:34:04.105 --> 1:34:07.666
he would have to run the last
two miles sub four minutes.

1:34:08.609 --> 1:34:11.135
I mean, in my opinion,
that's just not possible.

1:34:11.345 --> 1:34:13.211
We've been watching him
do the impossible

1:34:13.314 --> 1:34:15.009
for the last ten miles.

1:34:15.116 --> 1:34:16.116
Who knows?

1:34:16.217 --> 1:34:18.709
Maybe this little kid with a big heart

1:34:18.819 --> 1:34:24.383
is destined to show the world
the impossible is possible.

1:35:27.354 --> 1:35:28.354
Come on, kid!

1:35:28.689 --> 1:35:30.521
Quiet! You'll make him nervous.

1:35:42.903 --> 1:35:44.632
- Tyson, come on!
- Come on, Tyson.

1:35:44.739 --> 1:35:46.229
You got it, Tyson!

1:35:47.575 --> 1:35:49.043
Hey, come on, come on.

1:35:52.346 --> 1:35:55.680
<i>Why don't you say it?
He's what? He's not normal?</i>

1:35:55.783 --> 1:35:57.581
<i>He's not ready.</i>

1:36:32.787 --> 1:36:33.982
Yeah!

1:36:34.221 --> 1:36:35.221
Hey!

1:36:42.963 --> 1:36:43.987
You did it!

1:36:44.098 --> 1:36:46.294
You did it, Tyson.

1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:48.027
Did you see me, Mom?

1:36:48.135 --> 1:36:50.035
Yes, honey, we saw you.

1:36:50.137 --> 1:36:52.299
And did you see me, Dad?

1:36:52.439 --> 1:36:55.841
Did you see me finish ahead
of some of the best runners

1:36:55.943 --> 1:36:58.640
in the world on a certain day?

1:36:58.746 --> 1:37:00.976
Daddy saw you.

1:37:01.081 --> 1:37:03.743
Come here. We are so proud.

1:37:10.858 --> 1:37:12.917
Good job, baby.

1:37:49.530 --> 1:37:53.467
I'm not entirely sure
how it all works,

1:37:54.635 --> 1:37:57.570
but maybe I was first,

1:37:57.671 --> 1:38:01.938
so I could learn,
and you could learn from me.

1:42:05.419 --> 1:42:07.217
If you know so much about football,

1:42:07.321 --> 1:42:08.982
how come you don't play?

1:42:09.089 --> 1:42:12.616
'Cause I'd have to play with a bunch
of big idiots worse than you.

1:42:13.994 --> 1:42:16.691
Whatever, dude.

1:42:16.797 --> 1:42:19.459
If it ain't Forrest Chump
comin' to take a dump.

1:42:22.803 --> 1:42:25.829
Hey, Out-of-your-mind-Stein,
you run like a girl.

1:42:25.939 --> 1:42:27.600
Bet you pee like one, too.

1:42:29.409 --> 1:42:32.936
We better make sure he doesn't
flush his skinny butt down the toilet.
