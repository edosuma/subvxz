was his faith.

we connected

before therapy,

I was not someone that talked
about my feelings at all.

Oh, I've come to
the conclusion if I want to

18:38.451 --> 18:42.539
be a functioning
person of society,

19:06.813 --> 19:12.318
I got expelled in seventh
grade for drugs and a weapon.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.947
But realistically, I used to
carry a box cutter on me

to open up my blunts.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.285
Um, that's who I was.
So, I got sent to rehab.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.370
I was in rehab for six months.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.872
I got sent to a group home.

19:28.710 --> 19:32.171
and heartbreak at
a really young age.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.882
I dealt with being mentally,

19:33.923 --> 19:36.050
emotionally
and physically abused,

19:36.092 --> 19:38.887
which led me
to being very defiant

19:38.928 --> 19:41.848
and lost as a teenager.

19:41.890 --> 19:45.351
So I got sent
from place to place

19:45.393 --> 19:49.355
for five years
of my teenage life.

I got all my bad habits out

19:59.741 --> 20:01.326

20:01.367 --> 20:03.703
I did. That's what
I say. I totally did.

20:03.745 --> 20:05.622
I cheated on all
my girlfriends.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.540
I lied to my
girlfriends.

20:07.582 --> 20:11.294
I would date three people at
one time and not care at all.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.963
And now it's like,
I go to date someone

20:14.005 --> 20:16.966
and I let them in immediately
and I get screwed over.

20:17.008 --> 20:20.553

point where I'm not even sure if
I want to date anybody.

feel shitty anymore.

- Right. No.
- I really don't think I can.

- I finally was like,
fuck this. Relationship wise,

20:31.898 --> 20:34.233
I've had some
really shitty luck.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.693
I've been doing a lot
of healing so I've been

20:35.735 --> 20:37.487
trying to get
through some shit.

20:37.528 --> 20:40.114
Then after that Cassidy
stuff happened to me recently

20:40.156 --> 20:42.241
I was like, I'm going to go back
to being a fuck boy, because...

20:42.283 --> 20:44.577
So I honestly have no
idea what happened with that.

20:44.619 --> 20:47.038
We were on the low,
I guess,

20:47.080 --> 20:49.332
dating for like months
and then she started eating

20:49.374 --> 20:51.918
somebody else
and I stopped talking to her.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.545

dropped out of nowhere

trying to process that.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.507

Would me and Cuppie
be true lesbians

an ex in common?

getting to know Cuppie.

21:07.308 --> 21:10.687

how many similarities,

21:10.728 --> 21:12.313
even besides
our mental health issues,

21:12.355 --> 21:14.190
that we have in common.

21:14.232 --> 21:16.567
You and I weren't friends and
I feel like that kind of

21:16.609 --> 21:18.736
stemmed from, like,
me dating Cassidy.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.655
- I absolutely think so.
- I didn't even give you

21:20.697 --> 21:23.825
the time of day because of
everything she had to say.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.535
Just sucks. Actually
I was talking

21:25.576 --> 21:27.245
to Summer and Marissa
about that.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.247
And Marissa was straight up like

21:29.288 --> 21:30.623
"What if I told Summer

21:30.665 --> 21:32.125
all the things
that you did to me?

were years ago

you a certain way?"

Fucking right.

36:59.593 --> 37:01.219
When I first met Brianna,

37:01.261 --> 37:02.596
I was still
dealing with depression,

37:02.638 --> 37:04.306
but she helped
pull me out of that.

37:04.348 --> 37:06.934
But I always feel like
I'm not enough and

37:06.975 --> 37:11.021
that's something that
I felt a lot from my family.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.648
And...
I really hate that.

37:12.689 --> 37:14.316
I wish that's something
I could overcome.

37:14.358 --> 37:16.109
I'm working on it.

37:16.151 --> 37:18.946
I love you. Obviously,
I want to be with you.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.739
But I don't know if
I want a kid right now.

37:20.781 --> 37:23.033
Last year was supposed
to be my year of travel.

37:24.034 --> 37:26.370
- And, you know...

37:26.411 --> 37:28.455
I want possibly some
other things first.

37:28.497 --> 37:29.873
Yeah, like what?

37:29.915 --> 37:31.625
You know what.

37:31.667 --> 37:35.629
I eventually want
to make things more official.

37:35.671 --> 37:36.755
- Don't say that.

[phone ringing]

37:48.225 --> 37:49.559
[Kaleigh]: Hey.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.436
- Hey. Sorry,
it's windy as hell.

37:51.478 --> 37:53.063
I'm on a river walk,

37:53.105 --> 37:54.731
but I'm just
away from Summer

37:54.773 --> 37:57.192
so I figured this is
a good time to call you.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.570
So the engagement,

38:00.612 --> 38:03.407
they are currently designing
the ring and everything.

38:03.448 --> 38:06.076
I know her parents are coming
this weekend,

38:06.118 --> 38:09.204
but obviously,
Summer planned that

38:09.246 --> 38:11.289
and I didn't know she was
going to have them come

38:11.331 --> 38:13.542
the weekend I planned
to ask her to marry me.

38:13.583 --> 38:17.546
[Kaleigh]: You know how much
she is a family person?

38:17.587 --> 38:19.923
I know. I'm going
to definitely ask her dad

38:19.965 --> 38:21.758
this coming weekend
when they get here.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.468
I'm going to ask
for her hand in marriage.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.637
Hopefully, he says yes.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.765
I've never been as
excited about a relationship

38:28.807 --> 38:30.892
as I have been
obviously with Summer.

38:30.934 --> 38:33.478
I've always wanted to
be married to this girl.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.813
I knew from the moment

38:34.855 --> 38:36.231
I met her that that was
going to be

38:36.273 --> 38:39.401
the one so this
is a huge deal for me.

38:39.443 --> 38:41.236
Oh, and the other thing
I really fucking need

38:41.278 --> 38:42.696
your help with, honestly,

38:42.738 --> 38:45.407
is I don't know
what to say besides like,

38:45.449 --> 38:49.077
"Hey, will you marry me.
Okay, bye."

38:49.119 --> 38:51.163
That's the most
nerve-wracking part to me,

38:51.204 --> 38:54.541
is like forgetting
what I've planned to say.

38:54.583 --> 38:56.168
[Kaleigh]: We'll put something
together because,

38:56.209 --> 38:57.711
Summer, you know her.

38:57.753 --> 38:59.046
- She is very sentimental...
- I know.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.547
- ...with things.

39:00.589 --> 39:03.383
She would like
something personalized to her.

39:03.425 --> 39:08.346
- This is like very stressful.

39:08.388 --> 39:12.142
I feel like we've already
been together like six years.

39:12.184 --> 39:13.769
It's quite a long time.

39:13.810 --> 39:16.730
Putting a time frame on me?

39:16.772 --> 39:19.357
I actually never even
wanted to have kids growing up,

39:19.399 --> 39:21.485
but being with Brianna has
actually changed my mindset

39:21.526 --> 39:24.780
on that and it's something
that I won't budge on.

39:24.821 --> 39:27.324
Obviously, my parents went
through a really shitty divorce

39:27.365 --> 39:30.368
so that's my only
apprehension on that subject.

39:31.703 --> 39:35.373
Brianna might have like
a fear of moving things

39:35.415 --> 39:38.543
along in our future
just because

39:38.585 --> 39:40.295
of her parents' divorce.

39:40.337 --> 39:42.005
I wish that she would
realize that

39:42.047 --> 39:44.424
not every relationship
is going to end up that way.

39:44.466 --> 39:46.051
But I think she just
needs to know that I have

39:46.093 --> 39:48.178
no intention of
ever not being with her.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.554
She's my entire world.

39:49.596 --> 39:52.390
But I mean,
if you won't propose,

39:52.432 --> 39:56.895
I could just ask you like I did
ask you to be my girlfriend.

39:56.937 --> 39:59.356
You're going to propose to me?

39:59.397 --> 40:00.857
- Maybe if it doesn't
come soon enough.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.192
Oh, wow.

40:03.944 --> 40:06.571
Could you imagine
me get down on one knee?

40:06.613 --> 40:08.365
- No, that's
the last thing we want.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.075
- Oh my God.

40:11.284 --> 40:12.536
You're so annoying.
