WEBVTT

00:14.431 --> 00:16.432
So you want me to explain
how you just lost?

00:16.975 --> 00:20.978
Or do you want to stare at the board
your full three minutes,

00:21.522 --> 00:22.897
cling to hope?

00:28.195 --> 00:30.697
Come on. It's called speed chess.

00:56.432 --> 01:01.436
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye

01:21.165 --> 01:22.582
Good game.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.336
I said good game.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.019
Hey! Hey!

01:44.563 --> 01:47.064
Wait! Stop it! Listen...

01:49.026 --> 01:51.027
Back away. Back away.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.993
Call 911. Get an ambulance!

01:59.119 --> 02:00.536
Tell them to send two!

02:02.080 --> 02:03.790
My head's going to explode!

02:40.994 --> 02:42.203
Your head still hurt?

02:42.621 --> 02:43.663
You a moron?

02:43.789 --> 02:44.622
Nate!

02:45.707 --> 02:49.043
I'm clutching my head in pain
and he asks if it hurts?

02:49.795 --> 02:51.921
What are you, some kind of med
student?

02:52.047 --> 02:54.090
You look like you still have
theme birthday parties.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.174
Sorry.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.803
Any problems
concentrating in school lately?

02:58.929 --> 03:00.263
What, besides the dreams
of running my tongue

03:00.389 --> 03:02.098
along my French teacher's
breasts?

03:02.516 --> 03:04.267
No, I'm doing quite great.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.186
The rage and pain could be caused
by a parasite.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.938
- Does he eat a lot of sushi?
- No.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.649
He was a vegetarian
until just a few months ago.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.359
Any changes in behavior
since the new diet?

03:13.902 --> 03:14.944
No.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.947
He's been this way
since he became a teenager.

03:18.073 --> 03:21.242
It doesn't matter how much I yell or
punish, he's still gonna say what...

03:21.368 --> 03:24.912
Yeah. Let's all shed a tear
for poor little Nate's mother.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.709
- Any more stupid questions?
- Nate!

03:31.295 --> 03:33.212
I hate this kid.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.256
I like this kid.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.591
You haven't met him.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.468
I know you hate him.
What more do I need to know?

03:39.845 --> 03:43.014
Kid's not a clichÃ©. Anybody can get
into a fight after losing.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.683
It takes real creativity
to beat up someone you just beat.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.310
The pain's not limited to his head.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.353
The rest of his bumps and bruises
are accounted for

03:49.563 --> 03:51.647
by the 17 fights he's been in this
semester.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.400
- Concussion?
- MRI was clean, no frontal lobe tumor,

03:54.610 --> 03:56.694
and the tox screen showed no trace
of coke or amphetamines.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.571
Nate went medieval on the other kid.

03:58.697 --> 03:59.780
- Could be...
- Hold on.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.533
I'm having a moment.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.120
This could be Foreman's last time

04:06.246 --> 04:08.372
mistakenly suggesting
adrenal gland tumor.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.626
Which could create excess adrenaline,
causes the head pain and rage.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.336
But not the personality disorder.

04:13.462 --> 04:16.505
There is no personality disorder.
He's a teenager.

04:16.632 --> 04:19.550
Being a teenager excuses the odd
inappropriate comment.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.344
This kid say anything appropriate?

04:21.845 --> 04:23.262
He's having cluster headaches.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.265
Probably been having them for years.
Question is, what's causing them?

04:26.391 --> 04:29.352
If it were just a cluster headache,
he'd have swelling around the eyes.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.646
ER gave him ibuprofen for the pain.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.106
Useless for this pain, but it could've
knocked down the swelling.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.650
Best bet is a vascular problem.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.904
Normal treatment for cluster headaches
is steroids, which the ER also gave him.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.322
He's still in pain, which means...

04:41.448 --> 04:43.658
Normal treatment is called
"normal treatment"

04:43.784 --> 04:45.785
because sometimes
you have to use abnormal treatment.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.370
Start him on blood thinners,

04:47.496 --> 04:49.789
and give his noggin
transcranial magnetic stimulation.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.668
And don't you dare
touch that acerbic wit.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.922
Fifty bucks to whichever of you steps up
and treats this brat.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.799
Not the kid's fault. He's sick.

04:59.925 --> 05:00.967
Fine. You do it.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.344
No way. He's your brat.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.846
I'll do it.
But I've got a job interview after work.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.557
Anything comes up later,
you guys handle it.

05:08.684 --> 05:09.850
Need a peer recommendation?

05:09.977 --> 05:11.060
Thanks.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.564
Cameron should suffice.

05:23.907 --> 05:26.033
This isn't going to turn me into some,
like, drooling vegetable

05:26.159 --> 05:27.284
who wets his pants, is it?

05:27.411 --> 05:28.869
It's safe.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.788
The magnetic pulses
activate nerve cells,

05:30.914 --> 05:32.873
which will hopefully squelch the head
pain.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.042
Is there anything you can do
about the other pain?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.168
From the fights?

05:36.294 --> 05:39.797
Yeah, I mean, my face,
my shoulder, my stomach.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.966
I mean, I can barely bend my fingers.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.343
You're already on pain meds.
Nothing more I can do.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.803
Sure you can, man.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.055
Tell your homies to quit stomping on me.

05:49.433 --> 05:52.435
I'll get the word out
that you're a great guy.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.189
So do people watch what they say
around you?

05:57.315 --> 05:58.566
Because I'm black?

05:59.484 --> 06:01.152
No, because you're gay.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.162
Cluster headaches can persist for years,

06:11.288 --> 06:14.373
cause irritability or even hostility
towards others.

06:15.459 --> 06:18.836
You mean the illness
is affecting his personality?

06:19.296 --> 06:21.088
If these treatments work, it could...

06:21.214 --> 06:23.132
- Change him?
- Yeah.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.134
Oh, thank God!

06:30.348 --> 06:32.308
You must think I'm awful.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.019
Here my son's lying in a hospital bed...

06:35.645 --> 06:36.979
I'm pretty sure I get it.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.151
I thought I was a bad mother.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.113
And I hated myself

06:47.365 --> 06:49.116
because I hated him.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.000
What do you got for me this fine
morning?

06:58.126 --> 07:01.879
Blood thinners and TMS had no effect.
It's not cluster headaches.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.547
You accusing the symptoms of lying?

07:03.673 --> 07:05.091
Could be hemochromatosis.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.093
Wouldn't account
for the personality disorder.

07:07.219 --> 07:08.260
What about hypothyroidism?

07:08.386 --> 07:09.887
He's not getting aggressive and
lethargic.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.098
He's getting aggressive and aggressiver.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.975
What about ruptured dermoid cyst?

07:15.477 --> 07:19.271
Sorry. I just got dizzy there.
I was expecting to turn right.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.148
It's Foreman's turn to be shot down.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.400
The thing that Cameron said.

07:23.819 --> 07:25.778
Way to think outside the box.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.280
But no fat in the ventricles.
It's cluster headaches.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.534
Normal treatment didn't work.
Abnormal treatment didn't work.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.827
Good point, Foreman.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.122
But treatments don't always work.
Symptoms never lie.

07:36.248 --> 07:39.208
The only approved treatment left
for cluster headaches is brain surgery,

07:39.334 --> 07:41.168
and that's not even a guarantee.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.045
Back off, Foreman!

07:44.047 --> 07:47.299
If the approved treatment doesn't work,
we go with an unapproved treatment.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.805
Hey!

07:54.015 --> 07:55.266
Something on your mind?

07:56.893 --> 07:58.102
Because you totally can't tell.

07:58.228 --> 08:01.063
I had a job interview lined up
at New York Mercy yesterday.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.107
Hospital for Manhattan's glitterati.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.192
Big coup.
Your homies would be kvelling.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.903
Didn't happen, because
apparently I called to cancel.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.655
I don't remember making that call.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.782
- You think I have a neurological issue?
- Yes.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.117
Why are you jerking me around?

08:13.243 --> 08:14.076
It wasn't me.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.327
Yeah.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.497
It was one of the other petty,
socially repressed asses I work for.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.042
Maybe it was Ashton Kutcher.

08:29.634 --> 08:32.011
If you want me to stay,
tell me you want me to stay.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.179
Would it matter?

08:33.305 --> 08:35.389
No, but it'd be the adult way
to handle it.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.558
If the adult way doesn't work,
why bother with it?

08:37.684 --> 08:39.059
I've been totally professional!

08:39.519 --> 08:42.229
Gave two weeks' notice,
continued to work cases,

08:42.355 --> 08:44.398
scheduled my interviews
on my own time.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.818
You have no right to screw
with my future.

08:49.738 --> 08:54.033
You're gonna be all whiny during
the differential diagnoses, aren't you?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.577
It wasn't me.

08:57.996 --> 09:01.165
I only sabotage people
I consider worth it.

09:11.718 --> 09:15.137
You are one evil, cunning woman.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.556
It's a massive turn-on.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.267
You girls can gossip later.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.269
What are you talking about?

09:22.395 --> 09:26.357
You called New York Mercy
to have Foreman's job interview killed.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.317
When I said,
"You girls can gossip later,"

09:28.443 --> 09:31.987
I was throwing you out,
but in a polite way.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.075
Well, I take it
you're off your anti-depressants.

09:36.618 --> 09:39.036
You're deflecting.
Only I'm allowed to do that.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.537
Does Foreman actually think I did that?

09:40.664 --> 09:42.248
No. Just me.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.583
But I know something he doesn't:
I didn't do it.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.834
Why would I do it?

09:45.961 --> 09:47.211
- Do you want him to leave?
- No.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.046
Are you planning on doing something?

09:49.172 --> 09:50.422
I'm waiting for board approval.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.466
But if he takes the job,
there's nothing to be done.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.884
You had to stop him.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.679
It wasn't me.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.232
What are you doing?

10:08.650 --> 10:12.152
Looking for a tell.
Rapid eye blink, twitch of the lips.

10:12.946 --> 10:16.115
Send in Nurse Unger
when you pass her on your way out.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.785
Oh, almost forgot.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.870
I need to give a 16-year-old
magic mushrooms

10:21.997 --> 10:23.205
to treat a cluster headache.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.540
Is that cool?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.292
Yeah, no problem.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.215
I was being sarcastic.

10:33.508 --> 10:36.719
It wouldn't look that way
in the court transcript.

10:37.012 --> 10:40.139
Mushrooms have psilocybins
that work on cluster headaches.

10:40.265 --> 10:43.100
It's either that or cutting into his
brain and going on a fishing expedition.

10:43.226 --> 10:46.103
I assume you've considered
he could have a psychogenic experience,

10:46.229 --> 10:48.939
possibly suffer a fit
of severe paranoia.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.941
Well, I have now.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.819
Yeah, it's definitely better
that the Dean of Medicine prescribes it

10:53.945 --> 10:57.072
instead of an unhinged doctor
with a history of drug use.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.574
Takes the stink off
if the patient decides

10:58.700 --> 11:01.285
to put on a cape and fly off the roof.

11:02.203 --> 11:06.248
Low dose. No more than 10 milligrams,
tightly controlled setting.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.168
And make sure the mother
signs off on it.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.586
Party on, Garth.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.881
And don't stand in Foreman's way.
It's just wrong.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.720
New research shows that a chemical
component in the mushrooms can...

11:19.846 --> 11:23.974
Yeah, lots of technical medical stuff.
So when do I get them?

11:24.309 --> 11:26.769
I went to college.
I know about mushrooms.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.687
Friend of a friend shot himself
in the foot.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.148
They're not giving me a gun, Enid!

11:31.441 --> 11:32.691
Sign the consent form.

11:32.984 --> 11:36.695
We'll be monitoring him,
but cardiac arrest is possible.

11:36.821 --> 11:37.863
Big "E,"

11:38.531 --> 11:40.282
small "N"...

11:40.408 --> 11:42.701
And if the mushrooms don't work?

11:43.495 --> 11:46.580
The next step would be
a type of brain surgery.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.166
- Oh, God.
- Pain's getting worse!

11:49.292 --> 11:51.627
Need shrooms now!

12:15.902 --> 12:17.611
Oh, yeah.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.530
Nate, how's the pain?

12:21.908 --> 12:26.745
Hey, hey! It's Skippy, the bush
kangaroo!

12:27.330 --> 12:29.873
Your head, Nate.
We need to know how the pain is.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.000
What I got here

12:33.253 --> 12:35.003
is the opposite of pain.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.588
That means you're suffering
from cluster headaches,

12:36.714 --> 12:38.632
which means hopefully...

12:39.843 --> 12:41.844
Man, you're hot.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.138
She's making me horny.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.264
Deal with it.

12:45.390 --> 12:49.226
Hey, hey, hey, you can't get me stoned,
then not close the deal.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.395
- Shut up.
- Take it easy.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.856
You'll regret saying no!

12:54.357 --> 12:55.899
Check it out.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.485
Oh, for God's sake.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.237
Hold it.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.572
What are you doing?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.579
He has undersized testes.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.082
His other secondary sexual
characteristics are normal.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.585
If you want to
curry favor with me,

13:14.711 --> 13:16.837
avoid discussions of other men's
testicles.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.006
Thanks.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.632
Focus on phrases like,

13:20.758 --> 13:21.925
"You were right
about the cluster headaches."

13:22.051 --> 13:23.719
You're wrong about what caused them.

13:23.845 --> 13:27.014
Vascular problem in a major artery
wouldn't cause hypogonadism.

13:27.140 --> 13:31.643
Okay, what causes rage, headaches,
personality disorder and hypogonadism?

13:31.936 --> 13:33.228
Where's Foreman?

13:33.354 --> 13:34.605
He's mad at me.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.690
- Why?
- No reason.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.983
Yeah. That makes sense.

13:38.109 --> 13:41.862
The male genitals are controlled
by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.989
We're not talking
about Foreman anymore.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.240
Kid's being pummeled at school.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.826
A couple blows to the head
can cause hypothalamic lesions.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.120
We ever going to talk about
what happens when Foreman's gone?

13:50.246 --> 13:53.999
If this were an employee-owned airline
in Scandinavia, yes.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.959
It's not lesions. His temperature
would be all over the map.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.003
Symptoms don't lie.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.507
He's gone in less than a week,
and you haven't even read a rÃ©sumÃ©.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.759
Doesn't even need to.
The two of us can handle it.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.345
Craniopharyngioma fits the symptoms.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.972
Biopsy the brat's pituitary.

14:10.016 --> 14:13.227
And let the record show
I was right about the cluster headaches.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.730
- Forget it!
- It's a straightforward procedure.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.607
We thread an endoscopic tube
up through the nostril...

14:18.816 --> 14:21.193
And cut something out of my brain?
No way.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.320
If it's a tumor, it could kill you.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.906
Just give me more shrooms, okay?
I'll be fine.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.282
You only need my consent, right?

14:27.408 --> 14:30.369
- Yeah, but it'll be a lot easier if...
- Do whatever you have to do.

14:30.745 --> 14:35.040
You don't touch me, all right?
You can touch me, just not my brain.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.334
Nate, you got to do this.
I can't take it anymore...

14:37.460 --> 14:40.754
My God, Mom! Save me
the melodramatic hand-wringing, okay?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.173
Loosen up! Get yourself coited.

14:44.342 --> 14:45.968
I'm going to give him a sedative.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.512
You're decent-looking, Dr. Skippy.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.267
Why don't you take her for a ride?

14:54.310 --> 14:55.435
Nate?

14:56.271 --> 14:57.896
Are you in pain?

15:04.195 --> 15:05.362
Nate?

15:05.989 --> 15:08.240
His heart rate's normal.
Respiration's even.

15:08.366 --> 15:11.326
What's happening?
What's the matter with him?

15:11.995 --> 15:14.746
He's jaundiced.
His liver's shutting down.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.088
We've started him
on sodium polystyrene sulfonate.

15:23.214 --> 15:24.881
His liver's operating at about 20%

15:25.008 --> 15:26.633
and deteriorating fast.

15:27.468 --> 15:31.888
Which means he'll be dead long before
Foreman turns in his parking pass.

15:32.015 --> 15:36.351
So what causes personality disorder,
head pain, blah, blah, blah,

15:36.477 --> 15:37.769
and liver failure?

15:37.895 --> 15:40.772
Liver failure can cause
hypogonadism, head pain.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.609
Altered mental status leads to
the personality disorder and rage.

15:43.735 --> 15:45.694
All we need to do is figure out
what caused the liver failure.

15:46.112 --> 15:49.323
Yes. Also, we need to figure out
how symptoms yesterday

15:49.449 --> 15:51.241
can be caused by liver failure today.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.327
If his liver's failing now,
it wasn't great yesterday.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.537
If it wasn't operating at capacity,
it could have caused...

15:57.123 --> 15:59.499
Don't sneak up on a person like that!

15:59.876 --> 16:02.628
- I'm listening.
- Well, listening doesn't help me.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.007
Okay. Let's go with the liver
and a time-machine theory.

16:07.550 --> 16:11.428
- Foreman, what causes liver problems?
- Wilson's Disease.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.305
No. Ceruloplasmin is normal.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.766
No enlargement and no palpable mass,
so no cancer.

16:16.267 --> 16:19.770
Could be a narrowing of the bile ducts.
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.

16:19.896 --> 16:23.065
Most liver damage begins with
what we put in our bodies. Foreman?

16:23.441 --> 16:26.610
- Angry teen... Alcohol.
- No. Blood tests were negative.

16:26.736 --> 16:29.863
No signs of drug use or acetaminophen
poisoning in his tox screen.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.573
Maybe the water was contaminated.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.450
His mother would also be sick.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.786
Cuddy?

16:38.039 --> 16:39.956
Sounded like someone would back.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.458
Go.

16:42.502 --> 16:46.004
We'll try and muddle through
without your blank stare to guide us.

16:46.130 --> 16:49.800
So if it's not the bad things he's
putting in, what about the good things?

16:49.926 --> 16:51.343
He was raised a vegetarian.

16:51.469 --> 16:52.719
"Was raised."

16:52.970 --> 16:56.932
Means he's all grown up,
or he's not a vegetarian anymore.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.892
He started eating red meat
a few months ago.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.560
Unless he's been buying
cuts of mad cow,

17:00.687 --> 17:02.312
his body would have no problem
metabolizing it.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.439
What if he had an OTC deficiency?

17:04.899 --> 17:08.068
Body can't metabolize nitrogen,
damages the liver.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.945
Run a hamburger test.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.030
It's exactly what it sounds like.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.075
Stuff him full of meat,
wait for his ammonia levels to spike.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.085
I'll double your salary.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.006
Chase and Cameron would mutiny
if they found out.

17:30.133 --> 17:33.218
Chase and Cameron wouldn't be
heading up their own diagnostic group.

17:34.095 --> 17:37.180
You'd work in parallel with House.
It'll be your practice.

17:37.765 --> 17:41.268
Separate staff, separate cases,
complete autonomy.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.687
I've only been doing this
for three years.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.021
Three years under House.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.231
No better training.

17:46.357 --> 17:49.025
And when that case comes along
that I can't figure out,

17:49.152 --> 17:51.236
you know who I'd have to go to.

17:51.863 --> 17:55.240
Or you can just let that patient die.
That's completely up to you.

18:01.956 --> 18:02.998
No.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.375
Why?

18:06.794 --> 18:08.044
He's evil.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.839
He didn't sabotage your interview.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.090
How do you know?

18:12.216 --> 18:13.300
Because I did.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.347
I didn't!

18:21.017 --> 18:23.393
You believed me.
Means you're not sure House did it.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.270
Well, somebody did it.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.397
Somebody here did it.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.734
I can't work here.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.418
This isn't a medical procedure.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.087
This is just about Doogie
making me eat garbage.

18:51.422 --> 18:54.257
We need to see
how your liver processes the proteins.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.843
Then get me a steak. Some roast beef.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.095
What if I brought him
something from home?

18:59.222 --> 19:01.890
It has to be prepared here so we know
there's no chemicals or preservatives

19:02.016 --> 19:03.558
that could affect the test results.

19:03.684 --> 19:04.935
I'm not eating anything prepared

19:05.061 --> 19:08.313
by five-dollar-an-hour immigrant
hospital cooks in hairnets.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.815
Shut up!

19:10.024 --> 19:13.610
Either you start eating
or I'm going to strap you to this bed

19:13.736 --> 19:17.614
and shove these down your throat
one by one. Got it?

19:20.326 --> 19:21.952
Can't get mad at me!

19:22.411 --> 19:23.620
I'm sick!

19:25.122 --> 19:27.249
Supposed to feel bad for me.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.960
Nurse, full set of body restraints.

19:30.086 --> 19:31.253
Yes, Doctor.

19:31.546 --> 19:35.090
Trust me. It'll be a lot less messy
if you do it yourself.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.027
You killed Foreman's job interview.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.573
- Why would I...
- Somebody did.

19:59.699 --> 20:00.657
Wasn't me, and it wasn't House,

20:00.783 --> 20:02.951
which means it has to be somebody
who thought he was protecting House,

20:03.077 --> 20:05.078
which means it has to be somebody
who actually likes House,

20:05.371 --> 20:06.830
which means it's either you

20:06.956 --> 20:09.666
or the weird night janitor
who wears his pants backwards.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.794
I want Foreman to leave.

20:14.088 --> 20:17.132
House has to realize he needs
someone who stands up to him.

20:17.258 --> 20:19.801
Cameron's in love with him,
Chase is afraid of him and I enable him.

20:20.303 --> 20:21.761
- House needs limits.
- I give him...

20:21.888 --> 20:24.014
You authorize magic mushrooms.

20:24.140 --> 20:27.726
House is a six-year-old who thinks he's
better off without parents.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.061
A few tummy aches
after dinners of ice cream and ketchup

20:30.187 --> 20:31.730
might do him some good.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.191
You're lying.

20:36.152 --> 20:39.696
An enabler doesn't conspire against.
An enabler enables.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.991
- What?
- You're paranoid.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.744
You made that call.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.621
And because of that call,

20:47.830 --> 20:50.248
you basically guaranteed
Foreman's out of here.

20:58.299 --> 21:01.593
I thought it'd be fun
to work on my boat with him.

21:01.719 --> 21:05.388
And you went shirtless,
because skin cancer looks cool.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.808
Well, I realize I got burnt.
I'm not too worried about that.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.894
It's these white marks. You know.

21:11.145 --> 21:12.312
Lie down.

21:13.981 --> 21:19.444
I mean, that boat has all sorts of lead
paint, and there's chemicals everywhere.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.404
When Daddy works on his boat,

21:21.781 --> 21:26.242
does he have a cooler with lots of
brown bottles with long necks?

21:26.911 --> 21:30.914
And does Daddy like to lie down
on his boat and go nap-nap in the sun?

21:35.586 --> 21:37.545
Oh! What the hell?

21:40.424 --> 21:46.054
I will give you this
for the $1.41 in your pocket.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.515
Wait. How could you know...

21:49.100 --> 21:51.226
A psychic once told me that I'm psychic.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.777
Hey! One of these quarters is Canadian.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.280
Give me back my syringe.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.747
Hamburger stress test showed no
change in his ammonia levels.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.291
Liver's properly converting
the ammonia into urea.

22:15.418 --> 22:17.168
He doesn't have OTC deficiency.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.169
Welcome back.

22:18.295 --> 22:21.339
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been taking
my problems out on the patient.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.049
Or on me.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.592
Apology accepted.

22:25.469 --> 22:26.803
Starve him.

22:27.096 --> 22:28.221
And what are we looking for?

22:28.347 --> 22:32.100
Diabetic steatosis
would screw up his liver.

22:32.226 --> 22:34.185
Starve him overnight
and see if his blood sugar pops.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.563
We mess with his blood sugar,
we could set off another rage.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.274
Not a problem. You can take him.

22:42.653 --> 22:44.029
I want something to eat!

22:44.155 --> 22:45.905
- Honey, please don't.
- What happened?

22:46.032 --> 22:48.283
I was just trying to get a urine sample
and he went crazy.

22:48.409 --> 22:52.037
I need to eat!
You're not sticking anything else in me!

22:52.163 --> 22:53.413
It's just a few more hours.

22:53.539 --> 22:54.664
You're going to hurt yourself.

22:54.790 --> 22:55.832
I'm going to hurt you!

22:55.958 --> 22:58.168
As soon as we get a urine sample,
we can leave you alone.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.336
You want your sample?
Here's your damn sample!

23:00.463 --> 23:01.463
Nate, don't!

23:10.723 --> 23:12.057
Oh, my God!

23:13.934 --> 23:16.770
Nate, you need to get back into bed.
Right now.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.530
Chem panel and urinalysis confirms

23:27.656 --> 23:30.158
the bloody urine
was caused by kidney failure.

23:30.701 --> 23:33.161
He's on dialysis. He's going to need it
for the rest of his life.

23:33.496 --> 23:35.497
Which is shortening as we speak.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.665
We are looking at a Chinese menu.

23:37.792 --> 23:40.043
We've got symptoms
from too many columns.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.795
They are going to overcharge us.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.798
Multiple organ failure
could mean primary HIV infection.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.092
That'd mean someone agreed
to sleep with him.

23:47.218 --> 23:48.426
Plus, his serology is negative.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.220
His uric acid's slightly elevated.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.347
Ten percent of males
in this country have elevated...

23:52.473 --> 23:55.517
So we're only going to pay attention
to abnormal abnormalities?

23:55.643 --> 23:57.602
We've been stuffing him with meat
and his kidneys are shot.

23:57.728 --> 24:01.272
- Of course his uric acid level's...
- Could be hepatic fibrosis, or McAb.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.066
Brat's got a genetic disorder.

24:03.192 --> 24:06.903
Get the sequencing primers. See if
it's one of the ones we can treat.

24:07.238 --> 24:08.822
I can draw some blood,
but then I got to run.

24:09.615 --> 24:10.990
Job interview?

24:12.159 --> 24:14.452
You going to stop me if it is?

24:15.746 --> 24:18.164
You do the nurse stuff.
They'll do the doctor stuff.

24:28.217 --> 24:31.052
Is this a blood test
for our marriage license?

24:31.804 --> 24:35.807
Planning on kidnapping me
to Massachusetts? Can't...

24:38.310 --> 24:39.811
What did you give him?

24:40.312 --> 24:42.105
Are you treating him for something?

24:42.231 --> 24:43.398
A sedative.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.526
- Did he need a sedative?
- I did.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.237
Just shutting him up so I can draw
some of his blood in peace.

24:49.363 --> 24:51.281
You walked in with that.
You didn't even give him a chance.

24:51.407 --> 24:52.615
People are what they are.

24:52.741 --> 24:53.950
He's sick.

24:54.076 --> 24:56.369
The rudeness isn't his fault.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.122
If he had tuberculosis,
it wouldn't be his fault either.

24:59.248 --> 25:01.666
But I still wouldn't
let him cough on me.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.842
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:16.682 --> 25:17.724
Where are you going?

25:17.850 --> 25:20.518
The lab. We're testing our patient's
blood for a hereditary...

25:20.644 --> 25:23.479
Cuddy thinks I sabotaged
Foreman's interview.

25:23.606 --> 25:25.273
She's going to fire me.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.401
I don't believe it.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.486
She said it was unprofessional and...

25:30.613 --> 25:33.239
No, I mean, I literally
don't believe it.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.034
Cuddy wouldn't fire you
for something like that.

25:36.577 --> 25:41.623
Which means either she lied to you
or you're lying to me.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.295
You so would have fallen for that
three years ago.

25:47.421 --> 25:48.630
You were looking for a reaction.

25:48.756 --> 25:51.549
You were looking for me to
feel bad for you, save your skin.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.135
But how am I going to save you?

25:54.386 --> 25:58.514
Unless you think I'm the one
who really did it.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.809
Cuddy's logic was,

26:01.936 --> 26:04.562
Foreman's valuable to House,
I care about House,

26:04.688 --> 26:06.898
ergo, I would do anything to save him.

26:07.024 --> 26:11.152
And your logic was, I care about House
as much as you do, ergo...

26:12.738 --> 26:14.072
It wasn't me.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.324
I don't care about House.

26:16.450 --> 26:17.617
I don't believe you.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.702
No one does.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.955
House is nothing more than my boss.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.207
Foreman's nothing more
than a colleague.

26:25.668 --> 26:26.876
You're lying.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.003
Everyone does.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.130
But it wasn't me.

26:44.645 --> 26:47.105
No markers for hepatic fibrosis.

26:47.398 --> 26:49.107
And nothing for McAb.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.442
Foreman's interview in New York
got screwed up.

26:51.694 --> 26:52.986
I heard.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.280
Foreman thought it was House.
House thought it was Cuddy.

26:55.406 --> 26:58.157
Cuddy thought it was Wilson.
Wilson thought it was me.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.328
And you think it was me?

27:04.248 --> 27:07.542
God... You think I sabotaged Foreman?

27:07.668 --> 27:08.918
I don't even want him here.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.253
I know.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.587
Then why would I do...

27:11.714 --> 27:14.924
I think you sabotaged Foreman
just to sabotage Foreman.

27:18.304 --> 27:21.764
So everyone's a suspect
because everyone wants to help House,

27:21.890 --> 27:26.144
except for me, I'm a suspect
because I'm a petty, vindictive jerk?

27:30.691 --> 27:33.818
You actually think
I would do something like that?

27:34.028 --> 27:35.028
It was someone.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.112
It wasn't me.

27:40.451 --> 27:42.660
Negative for Von Gierke disease.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.204
And it's Tuesday.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.664
I know.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.417
I like you.

27:49.710 --> 27:50.793
I know.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.212
See you next Tuesday.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.801
Found something.

28:01.096 --> 28:04.223
He's got a partial HPRT enzyme
deficiency.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.642
Means he could have
Kelley-Seegmiller Syndrome.

28:06.977 --> 28:11.314
But it's a partial deficiency,
so it may not be Kelley-Seegmiller.

28:12.316 --> 28:15.109
Yes, those are the two options. It is,

28:15.235 --> 28:16.235
or it isn't.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.321
Kelley-Seegmiller explains
the aggressive personality.

28:18.447 --> 28:20.948
If he had Kelley-Seegmiller,
he wouldn't just be aggressive.

28:21.075 --> 28:23.701
He'd be self-mutilating.
Chewing his lips, banging his head.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.328
Lovely disease.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.830
Degenerative, fatal, incurable.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.416
I wonder if that's why Cameron's
on the "not" side?

28:30.542 --> 28:32.877
That and the fact that
symptoms don't lie.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.838
Kelley-Seegmiller carriers
self-mutilate when they're stressed.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.674
He's in ICU with a failing liver
and no kidneys.

28:38.801 --> 28:40.551
Yeah, his life is sweet.

28:41.220 --> 28:44.013
His vegetarian diet could have limited
the purines in his system,

28:44.264 --> 28:46.224
slowing the disease's progress.

28:47.810 --> 28:48.768
So let's speed it up.

28:48.894 --> 28:49.894
Why?

28:50.854 --> 28:52.980
So you two kids will stop fighting.

28:53.107 --> 28:55.400
Also, I don't feel like waiting
for respiratory failure.

28:55.526 --> 28:58.653
Chase, find some way
for the mother to get lost for a while.

28:58.779 --> 29:02.198
I'm going to stress this kid
till he bites off a finger.

29:10.499 --> 29:12.291
You move me to geriatrics?

29:12.668 --> 29:14.043
Who are you?

29:14.169 --> 29:15.253
Dr. McCaney.

29:16.004 --> 29:18.423
The man who's going to kick your ass
all over this chess board.

29:18.549 --> 29:19.590
Well, I'm too weak to...

29:19.716 --> 29:21.259
To bite yourself. Yeah.

29:21.385 --> 29:23.136
You need some liquid energy.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.514
Now, if you consent, I'm gonna give you
this shot of adrenaline.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.518
I don't want to play.

29:30.644 --> 29:33.438
Aside from being indicative
of pituitary issues

29:33.564 --> 29:37.775
and certain kinds of genetic disorders,
small testicles also indicate

29:39.987 --> 29:41.487
that you're a big chicken.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.574
Please don't make me do the sound
effect.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.118
You're not going to
goad me into playing.

29:47.244 --> 29:48.911
Didn't think I'd have to.

29:49.037 --> 29:52.290
Thought you'd just jump at the chance
of humiliating someone.

29:58.005 --> 30:00.548
Age before cripple. I'm white.

30:05.262 --> 30:08.014
It is on.

30:17.191 --> 30:21.152
Bird's Opening. Passive approach.
Sign of a coward.

30:21.695 --> 30:24.405
Sicilian Defense. Sign of an idiot.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.866
Arrogance has to be earned.

30:28.035 --> 30:30.244
Tell me what you've done to earn yours.

30:30.787 --> 30:32.288
I can walk.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.290
I don't bleed out of my penis.

30:49.306 --> 30:50.306
Check.

30:54.436 --> 30:59.398
You know, it's a real thin line
between tortured genius

30:59.525 --> 31:03.194
and awkward kid who can't get girls
because he's creepy.

31:09.409 --> 31:10.785
Why are you doing this?

31:11.453 --> 31:12.745
To stress you out.

31:14.248 --> 31:15.289
Check.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.291
Yeah, but why?

31:17.793 --> 31:18.960
Well, I'd tell you,

31:19.086 --> 31:21.587
but I figure it's more stressful
if you don't know why.

31:23.799 --> 31:26.300
Yeah, well, I'm not
feeling too stressed.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.136
You know that no one likes you, right?

31:29.263 --> 31:30.846
Yeah. Well, anybody like you?

31:30.973 --> 31:32.223
You're dying.

31:39.398 --> 31:40.690
Check.

31:46.572 --> 31:47.738
Your move.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.858
Care to lay down your king?

32:26.069 --> 32:27.361
You can't win.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.572
You can pin my queen.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.116
My knight to E7.

32:32.492 --> 32:33.868
Your king to H8.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.953
Sacrifice rook takes pawn.

32:36.079 --> 32:37.288
Bishop blocks.

32:37.414 --> 32:38.414
Queen to H5.

32:38.832 --> 32:39.957
Checkmate.

32:41.168 --> 32:43.294
Save what's left of your dignity.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.504
Lay down your king.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.102
Crap.

33:02.272 --> 33:04.023
He's having a seizure.

33:04.232 --> 33:06.108
Four milligrams I.V. lorazepam.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.193
Right away.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.881
I hate this kid.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.384
I like this kid.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.970
Did you get the job?

33:35.097 --> 33:36.097
They're going to let me know.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.432
Kelley-Seegmiller
didn't cause this seizure.

33:38.558 --> 33:42.561
So we've got one more symptom,
one less diagnosis.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.939
I assume they're going to call for
references.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.399
Did you give them my name?

33:46.525 --> 33:47.525
No.

33:47.651 --> 33:49.360
Amyloidosis can cause seizures,

33:49.486 --> 33:51.487
and the protein buildup
could cause organ failure.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.155
Wouldn't alter his personality.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.907
Whose name did you give?

33:55.867 --> 33:57.118
My last boss.

33:57.244 --> 33:58.077
Ouch.

33:58.537 --> 33:59.578
That can't look good.

34:00.914 --> 34:02.581
I hate this kid.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.376
What if we're not dealing
with one condition?

34:05.502 --> 34:07.253
What if it's multiple conditions?

34:07.379 --> 34:09.004
It's got to be one. It's always one.

34:09.131 --> 34:11.340
But nothing explains
this constellation of symptoms.

34:11.466 --> 34:12.842
We've got to be missing something.

34:12.968 --> 34:14.593
Maybe the kid lied
about some medication.

34:14.720 --> 34:15.761
Maybe he's hiding something...

34:15.887 --> 34:19.140
- Why would he be hiding something?
- Well, I don't know, because he's evil?

34:21.059 --> 34:22.727
What if he is?

34:24.187 --> 34:26.021
What if the symptoms lied?

34:29.860 --> 34:31.152
There.

34:31.278 --> 34:35.364
Now all we're looking at is a simple
evil jerk with amyloidosis.

34:35.490 --> 34:36.741
You're not being objective.

34:36.867 --> 34:38.117
Amyloidosis was your idea.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.910
You were right.
It doesn't fit the symptoms.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.871
Yeah, it does. Look.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.999
You crossed it off
because you want to hate the kid,

34:45.125 --> 34:46.417
and you can't hate him
if he's a victim...

34:46.543 --> 34:47.710
You want him to be a victim

34:47.836 --> 34:49.462
because you want to believe
that people are good.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.922
And if they're not,
it's got to be a chemical problem.

34:52.048 --> 34:53.883
Except they're not, and it's not.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.470
Flush him with immunosuppressants.

34:57.804 --> 35:00.723
Get a biopsy to confirm,
and find him a marrow donor.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.191
What'll happen to him?

35:10.859 --> 35:12.902
Substances called amyloid proteins

35:13.028 --> 35:15.946
build up in the body's organs,
shutting them down.

35:17.157 --> 35:21.869
It's a fairly rare disease,
and I'm afraid it can be fatal.

35:24.080 --> 35:28.876
So, do you operate or something
to take them out?

35:29.002 --> 35:31.837
He needs a bone marrow transplant.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.549
Dr. Cameron is searching
the donor bank.

35:35.842 --> 35:37.843
We should test you as well.

35:42.265 --> 35:47.019
When you first
told me he was sick, I was

35:47.813 --> 35:48.813
happy.

35:51.525 --> 35:52.858
Relieved.

35:56.613 --> 35:57.947
Now...

36:02.327 --> 36:05.913
Nate, I'm going to take
a small piece of nerve from your ankle.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.332
Let me know if you feel any pain.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.917
I'm burning up.

36:10.961 --> 36:13.128
Why can't you just knock me out
like you did last time?

36:13.255 --> 36:14.547
Wish I could.

36:14.673 --> 36:17.967
But your body has to be clear
so it's ready for a marrow transplant.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.343
Hey, Dr. X.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.973
I know you've busted ass
trying to save me.

36:24.766 --> 36:25.641
It's all right.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.894
I wasn't going to thank you.

36:29.813 --> 36:31.355
I was going to tell you

36:31.857 --> 36:33.190
you really suck at this.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.442
We're doing our best.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.862
That's sort of my point.

36:39.990 --> 36:41.282
Your best really sucks.

36:49.332 --> 36:52.877
Nerve biopsy was clean.
No evidence of amyloidosis.

36:53.169 --> 36:56.130
It was your idea.
Don't give up on it so fast.

36:56.256 --> 36:57.339
He's running a fever.

36:57.465 --> 37:00.134
If it's two conditions,
one of them's got to be an infection.

37:00.260 --> 37:02.887
We should start him on antibiotics,
see what clears up, what doesn't.

37:03.013 --> 37:04.346
Is he having trouble breathing?

37:04.472 --> 37:07.266
Yeah, he has mucus in his chest
from an infection.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.435
Could also be from an amyloid buildup.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.937
Keep him on immunosuppressants
and biopsy somewhere else.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.105
His sinuses.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.149
Look, you got two choices:

37:15.275 --> 37:17.192
engage me in a futile argument
then do what I asked,

37:17.319 --> 37:18.652
or just do what I asked.

37:21.865 --> 37:23.073
You're not ready.

37:26.036 --> 37:27.536
There was a third choice.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.496
"Don't do what I asked."

37:29.998 --> 37:32.291
You could have defied me,
stuck the kid on antibiotics,

37:32.417 --> 37:33.834
but you didn't.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.212
Because you still trust my judgment
more than your own.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.823
You sabotaged Foreman's job interview,
didn't you?

38:07.577 --> 38:09.662
Foreman's already been over this.

38:10.205 --> 38:11.163
It wasn't me.

38:13.166 --> 38:15.459
Everybody's chasing ghosts over this,

38:15.585 --> 38:17.044
which means either nobody did it

38:17.170 --> 38:19.755
or somebody wants everybody
chasing ghosts.

38:20.173 --> 38:21.715
Now, who does that sound like?

38:23.176 --> 38:24.259
And why would I do that?

38:24.552 --> 38:26.512
Because as long as Foreman
thought you were guilty,

38:26.638 --> 38:29.056
he was going to be useless around here.

38:32.978 --> 38:36.313
You know, sometimes I forget
why I hired you.

38:36.898 --> 38:40.067
You cost him a good opportunity
and gained nothing.

38:40.193 --> 38:42.194
I cost him a crappy opportunity.

38:42.988 --> 38:47.658
New York Mercy is where you go to treat
boils and cysts and build a 401-K.

38:47.784 --> 38:50.077
If you want him to stay, tell him.

38:50.203 --> 38:51.912
I don't, and there'd be no point.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.080
You do.

38:53.707 --> 38:56.333
And the point would be
to make him feel like he's wanted.

38:56.459 --> 38:57.584
He doesn't need that.

38:57.961 --> 39:01.213
All right, then, it'd make him feel
like maybe you weren't evil.

39:02.924 --> 39:04.216
He needs that.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.433
Talk to Foreman.

39:18.148 --> 39:20.024
We dumped one symptom,

39:21.901 --> 39:23.527
but forgot to add one.

39:31.161 --> 39:32.703
Revenge time, Nate.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.747
- Are you...
- Yes, I am.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.416
Black or white?

39:38.877 --> 39:40.252
Just limp away.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.212
He doesn't want to play.
Leave him alone.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.673
Pick one, or this comes out.

39:45.759 --> 39:48.052
And for all you know,
this is really important.

39:56.102 --> 39:57.061
Stop it!

39:57.187 --> 39:58.270
That hurts, right?

39:58.563 --> 40:01.398
Which is odd,
because I'm really enjoying this.

40:02.192 --> 40:05.235
You hold the pieces that way
because you can't bend your thumb,

40:05.904 --> 40:08.113
because your bones
have formed abnormally,

40:08.615 --> 40:11.492
thanks to all the crap that's been
pushing its way in between them.

40:11.618 --> 40:13.994
Actually, this stuff
isn't important at all.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.413
Your doctors said
he needs immunosuppressants.

40:16.539 --> 40:19.374
They're idiots. It's not amyloidosis.

40:19.501 --> 40:21.001
It's iron.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.336
He's got hemochromatosis.

40:23.963 --> 40:28.050
The body absorbs iron from food but
can't process it, can't get rid of it.

40:28.301 --> 40:30.844
Idle iron is the devil's playground.

40:30.970 --> 40:34.973
Builds up in the organs and joints,
whacking them in the process.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.517
Causes all the symptoms.

40:37.393 --> 40:39.895
Including something
that wasn't a symptom.

40:40.021 --> 40:43.023
Those body aches?
They were not from the fighting.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.858
His personality issues?

40:45.568 --> 40:46.652
Sorry.

40:46.903 --> 40:49.279
The iron's innocent on that count.

40:49.823 --> 40:51.156
Your kid's a jerk.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.534
Yeah, it's probably your fault.

40:53.660 --> 40:56.161
Although, if you'd stayed off the meat
like your mom said,

40:56.287 --> 40:59.456
you'd have half as much iron
and be twice less

40:59.582 --> 41:00.666
almost dead.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.211
Oh, nurse!

41:10.051 --> 41:12.427
This patient is bleeding, for some
reason.

41:13.096 --> 41:14.555
Is he going to be okay?

41:14.681 --> 41:16.098
He'll need dialysis,

41:16.224 --> 41:17.224
gonna have to get his blood drained

41:17.350 --> 41:19.601
every few months
for the rest of his life.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.061
My condolences.

41:21.521 --> 41:24.523
It's going to be
a long and annoying life.

41:30.071 --> 41:31.530
And I wouldn't have taken your bishop.

41:31.906 --> 41:34.324
I'd have moved my queen to D6,
defusing the threat,

41:34.450 --> 41:36.994
then rook to E8, attacking the king's
pawn.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.538
I'd have lost the exchange
but won the game.

41:41.583 --> 41:43.000
I know.

41:45.420 --> 41:46.503
I was bluffing.

41:48.590 --> 41:50.048
And that's why

41:51.634 --> 41:52.634
you lost.

41:56.431 --> 41:57.556
Jerk.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.035
You just here to watch
or you got something to say?

42:25.168 --> 42:28.212
Still running the new biopsy
for amyloidosis?

42:29.047 --> 42:31.215
Yeah. Still nothing.

42:37.388 --> 42:40.265
Run the test again.
Recheck your results.

42:41.726 --> 42:44.019
Looks like you're in for an all-nighter.
