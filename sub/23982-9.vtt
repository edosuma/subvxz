01:08.152 --> 01:10.196
I don't know her name,
but she's English.

01:10.863 --> 01:14.200
She helped Pete run a con on Lance
to get back some money he stole.

01:14.826 --> 01:15.702
What?

01:16.077 --> 01:17.495
It's too long and complicated.

01:17.829 --> 01:20.873
Anyway, I heard her say she has a bookstore
on Bleecker in the Village.

01:21.332 --> 01:25.503
Gonna find her, gonna make her tell us
what Maggie and Pete are really up to.

01:27.338 --> 01:28.715
Grandpa and Sam lied to me.

01:29.716 --> 01:30.758
Lied about what?

01:31.009 --> 01:33.136
What happened to Mum and Dad,
the accident.

01:34.304 --> 01:36.180
They told me that they
were hit by some drunk

01:36.222 --> 01:39.058
but Taylor said that the police report
didn't mention the guy was drunk.

01:39.726 --> 01:41.519
And then they said,
"Well, maybe the cop made a mistake."

01:41.561 --> 01:42.687
but I could tell they were lying.

01:42.812 --> 01:45.565
Well, my guess is that your grandpa
and Sam were drunk themselves.

01:46.399 --> 01:50.320
The man who killed Lila and Danny
may or may not have been drunk

01:50.403 --> 01:51.487
but he was a drunk.

01:52.196 --> 01:53.406
Jacques Reynard.

01:54.824 --> 01:57.994
His family came down from Quebec
a few generations back.

01:58.661 --> 02:00.121
Strong Catholics, good people.

02:00.788 --> 02:01.914
Until Jacques.

02:03.207 --> 02:05.543
Pardon my French,
but he was a mean motherfucker.

02:23.645 --> 02:24.646
There you go.

02:26.230 --> 02:27.523
She didn't call or text?

02:28.816 --> 02:30.360
I think she picked up my tail.

02:31.277 --> 02:34.489
She slowed down when she came by here,
but then kept going.

02:36.407 --> 02:37.283
There you go.

02:42.622 --> 02:43.748
What do you want, Sean?

02:46.793 --> 02:47.919
I never thanked you.

02:48.628 --> 02:49.712
Thanked me for what?

02:49.962 --> 02:51.631
The firecrackers in my locker

02:53.091 --> 02:54.967
the roaches in my gym clothes

02:55.885 --> 02:58.930
the name calling, the threats

03:00.473 --> 03:02.350
the fucking crayfish.

03:02.767 --> 03:03.810
We were kids.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.354
Did you know crayfish feel pain?

03:08.147 --> 03:09.190
- No.
- Oh.

03:09.565 --> 03:10.441
True fact.

03:12.235 --> 03:14.946
But their shells get tougher because of it.

03:15.780 --> 03:16.989
You see where I'm going with this?

03:18.700 --> 03:19.867
You're the fucking crayfish.

03:20.076 --> 03:21.285
- Exactly.
- Mm.

03:21.411 --> 03:25.873
And all of the "practical jokes"
you and your fucking cousin played on me

03:27.083 --> 03:28.292
just made me stronger.

03:31.754 --> 03:34.841
I thought maybe you came here
to talk about Shannon.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.260
In a minute.

03:38.428 --> 03:41.264
I just wanna savour this,
cos almost 20 years later

03:41.347 --> 03:44.183
one of us is the CEO
of a successful business

03:44.267 --> 03:45.977
pulling out a half mil a year

03:47.353 --> 03:49.230
and one of us is a fucking cop.

03:51.816 --> 03:52.942
You're banging her, right?

03:57.572 --> 03:58.781
Simple question.

04:00.450 --> 04:02.493
Are you banging my wife?

04:05.079 --> 04:05.955
Yeah.

04:18.176 --> 04:19.594
Better you than me at this point.

04:21.220 --> 04:25.683
I was into her once,
but you eat filet mignon every night

04:25.767 --> 04:28.186
you kinda lose your taste for it, you know?

04:29.729 --> 04:31.564
She should've left you a long time ago.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.107
Was that the plan?

04:34.317 --> 04:37.487
Wait for the Hartford deal to go through,
and then split, take half?

04:38.404 --> 04:39.447
Yeah, I figured.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.659
You should tell her to take a look
at the paperwork

04:43.701 --> 04:45.745
I signed when I took over from Daddy.

04:48.247 --> 04:50.082
Since you didn't go to
college, I'll explain.

04:50.875 --> 04:53.419
ANB is now a separate entity

04:54.045 --> 04:55.963
what we call a holding company

04:56.714 --> 05:01.177
and as such is not subject
to community property statutes.

05:02.970 --> 05:06.557
I can't really see Shannon living off
a cop's salary, can you?

05:09.936 --> 05:11.270
It's not just about the money.

05:12.188 --> 05:15.107
What, you know what they say
about love and money, don't you?

05:15.858 --> 05:19.320
When you say you want both,
you really just want the money.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.409
AJ, how far can you snake the tube?

05:25.660 --> 05:28.079
According to the blueprint,
I only have to go 20 yards.

05:30.581 --> 05:33.793
Are you gonna keep doing this Henry
the Five checking-on-his-troops routine

05:33.876 --> 05:35.127
or are you gonna lend a hand?

05:35.294 --> 05:36.879
"We few, we happy few."

05:36.963 --> 05:37.839
I'm not happy.

05:39.924 --> 05:41.467
Is this gonna be ready by noon tomorrow?

05:42.552 --> 05:46.013
Not having an actual slot to test it on,
your guess is as good as mine.

05:46.681 --> 05:47.598
That's not true.

05:47.974 --> 05:49.058
My guess isn't a guess.

05:50.101 --> 05:51.394
How loud is it gonna be?

05:52.270 --> 05:53.938
You mean as measured on a decibel scale?

05:54.313 --> 05:58.401
Let's see, uh, lawnmower's 90 decibels,
jet engine is 120

05:58.568 --> 06:01.779
hearing damage can occur at 85 decibels,
gunshots are 140.

06:02.363 --> 06:03.698
This'll be about...

06:08.286 --> 06:09.161
That work?

06:09.453 --> 06:12.248
- What is his problem?
- Lack of friends.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.126
I thought you were headed to the casino.

06:15.835 --> 06:16.711
Soon.

06:17.086 --> 06:18.045
What name do you want?

06:18.087 --> 06:20.006
Something that you forget
a second after you hear it.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.759
Eleven million is a lot of money.

06:25.011 --> 06:26.470
You sure you know what you're in for?

06:26.888 --> 06:28.806
I'm in for $11 million. What about you?

06:30.016 --> 06:31.100
I'm doing it for her.

06:34.729 --> 06:35.688
What, Maggie?

06:37.356 --> 06:38.608
I had my shot at big money.

06:39.692 --> 06:41.360
My tribe was gonna build a casino.

06:41.986 --> 06:43.321
I saw nothing but trouble.

06:43.905 --> 06:46.532
My son saw only dollars.

06:48.534 --> 06:49.785
What happened to the casino?

06:50.328 --> 06:51.370
Council voted for it.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.539
Then members of the tribe started
getting kicked out.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.500
Fewer members meant more money
for those who remain.

06:58.753 --> 06:59.879
It never got built.

07:01.005 --> 07:02.965
And now I work for another tribe's casino.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.176
Gotta get to work.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.013
You guys best friends now?

07:10.264 --> 07:12.308
Kwahu was your cut-out, wasn't he?

07:13.476 --> 07:16.354
He's how you and Pete communicated
when you were on the run.

07:16.896 --> 07:19.482
I've known Kwahu since I was 14 years old.

07:20.149 --> 07:22.818
Dad used to take me with him
if he had a client on the reserve.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.404
Let me guess, he...
he understood your gifts.

07:26.781 --> 07:28.574
No, he had the best weed.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.125
Julia, hi.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.628
No, Sam and I have been to Luis' place.

07:40.795 --> 07:43.130
<i>He wasn't there.
So much for taking the hit off Valerie.</i>

07:43.756 --> 07:45.758
I know. He's with Dockery.

07:46.258 --> 07:49.178
I'm out of leverage,
and now Ayawamat is hunting for me.

07:49.553 --> 07:50.888
Sam and I will come and get ya.

07:51.097 --> 07:53.891
No, no, no, I'm fine, but can you pick up
Ellen and Jacob

07:53.933 --> 07:56.435
and take them to someone
completely unconnected to the family?

07:56.644 --> 07:58.813
<i>Well, yeah, sure,
but I'm worried about you.</i>

07:59.146 --> 08:01.899
Luis and Ayawamat, they're not gonna
stop looking for you.

08:02.108 --> 08:03.609
I got a place to lie low.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.486
Pretty sure no one'll think
to look for me here.

08:07.613 --> 08:08.489
Yeah.

09:51.592 --> 09:52.927
Hannah, baby.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.012
Come on, wake up.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.223
- I got your coffee.
- Just 30 minutes.

09:57.306 --> 09:59.558
No, no, not today.
You got make-up duty.

10:00.059 --> 10:01.560
What the hell are you talking about?

10:01.602 --> 10:03.354
Those two old fucks,
the ones you let into the house

10:03.395 --> 10:06.190
to steal the Proclamation?
You gotta make right.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.317
I need you to watch Valerie's house.

10:08.359 --> 10:10.528
Can't I just give you a handy or something?

10:11.237 --> 10:12.238
That's tempting, but no.

10:12.530 --> 10:14.281
- Come on.
- Can I have a gun?

10:15.324 --> 10:16.826
- You want my gun?
- Yeah.

10:16.951 --> 10:18.035
Mm, yeah.

10:18.077 --> 10:19.078
- Yeah?
- Mmm...

10:19.120 --> 10:21.914
- I wanna carry your gun.
- Oh, you wanna carry my gun?

10:22.039 --> 10:23.958
- I like your...
- Mmm.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.644
You know,
I'll be leaving for work soon.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.271
Do you need a ride?

10:49.150 --> 10:51.110
I'm not leaving until it's dark.

11:02.580 --> 11:03.914
Seriously?

11:09.712 --> 11:10.880
Fuck.

11:24.685 --> 11:25.561
Huh.

12:06.894 --> 12:07.811
Arnold.

12:13.108 --> 12:14.735
What was Suzanne so excited about?

12:14.902 --> 12:15.903
She got some great news.

12:18.072 --> 12:19.406
That's not great news.

12:21.158 --> 12:24.453
Um, uh... I don't know.
Yeah, I'll call you back.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.249
- Who was that?
- That was Kwahu.

12:28.707 --> 12:33.712
Uh, Suzanne, the casino manager,
she's having the buffalo authenticated

12:33.921 --> 12:35.130
by the Smithsonian.

12:35.339 --> 12:37.758
- When?
- Tomorrow at noon.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.265
So, this is what we have.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.892
Uh, they find out
that it's a regular buffalo

12:46.934 --> 12:50.229
they put it back in the museum,
we have to scrap everything and start over.

12:50.854 --> 12:53.190
That's the best-case scenario.

12:53.315 --> 12:56.777
The worst-case scenario
is that they find the $11 million

12:57.236 --> 12:59.530
and it's the biggest jackpot
the casino's ever had.

13:00.072 --> 13:01.407
There has to be another option.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.037
We go tonight.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.083
- Tonight?
- We go in

13:11.458 --> 13:14.003
with half a build and no rehearsal.

13:14.128 --> 13:15.796
We have to convince them, but I don't...

13:16.505 --> 13:21.260
Look, you're a professional,
and you've been doing this all your life

13:22.094 --> 13:24.430
and, uh, so has every member of your team.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.890
Right, so, but even if we were
gonna go in with half a build

13:26.932 --> 13:28.517
Suzanne's working tonight, right?

13:28.600 --> 13:31.520
And if she doesn't recognise me,
she's gonna recognise you and Gina.

13:31.562 --> 13:32.855
Then get her out of the picture.

13:33.397 --> 13:34.648
What's with all the confidence?

13:35.232 --> 13:39.778
Look, two days ago, you were in a car
on your way to die in a tub of acid

13:40.904 --> 13:41.905
and now, you're here.

13:42.614 --> 13:43.490
Hm?

13:56.712 --> 13:58.380
<i>- Katie?</i>
- I'm sorry

13:58.464 --> 14:01.717
but the number you've reached
no longer takes calls from con men

14:01.800 --> 14:03.218
looking to get out of trouble.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.846
$5,000, three hours, including travel.

14:05.888 --> 14:06.930
No guns, no nudity.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.933
- Tell me you don't need the money.
- Ugh...

14:09.975 --> 14:12.644
- What is it?
<i>- It's a 24-hour Montezuma.</i>

14:16.106 --> 14:17.566
Who, what, where, when?

14:17.608 --> 14:18.609
<i>It's the Mohegan Sun.</i>

14:18.650 --> 14:20.944
It's a casino manager,
you're a Hartford reporter

14:22.237 --> 14:23.655
and it has to be this afternoon.

14:24.448 --> 14:25.991
You provide the cocktail.

14:39.088 --> 14:41.548
Alright, change of plans.

14:43.384 --> 14:45.552
- We gotta go in tonight.
- Very funny.

14:46.261 --> 14:48.555
No, I'm serious.
We turn into a pumpkin tomorrow at noon.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.849
- The machines aren't ready.
- I know.

14:51.225 --> 14:52.559
I know, we gotta work faster.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.019
That, that's not possible.

14:54.186 --> 14:56.188
It's physically impossible, Marius.

14:56.271 --> 14:57.815
Finish the crate and wrap it.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.026
- And what's inside?
- Nothing.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.113
We move tonight...

15:06.156 --> 15:08.200
You have the casino manager to deal with.

15:08.784 --> 15:11.245
- You gonna put her in the crate?
- Katie's taking care of that.

15:11.370 --> 15:12.663
I thought she was out.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.665
She's doing a surprise guest performance.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.208
How's the water gag coming along?

15:16.250 --> 15:18.585
You want it done right
or do you want it done fast?

15:18.627 --> 15:20.838
- I want it done both.
- It's like telling Monet

15:20.921 --> 15:22.548
to hurry up with the water lilies.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.259
The bigger the pay-out,
the bigger the mistakes.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.970
You're letting all this money
just fuck up your head, son.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.721
Look, I know that I'm no con

15:30.013 --> 15:33.225
- but I also know that rushing is a mistake.
- Alright.

15:42.818 --> 15:43.694
Porter.

15:45.863 --> 15:49.491
Do you remember that wildcatter
we took down in East Texas?

15:49.867 --> 15:54.830
It was you, me, and the mark standing
in the middle of an empty oil field.

15:55.664 --> 16:00.210
We had 30 minutes of prep
and an oil can filled with ink

16:00.836 --> 16:02.796
and that was it.

16:03.255 --> 16:06.967
AJ, what about that safe we cracked
on Rodeo Drive?

16:07.551 --> 16:09.511
In the middle of the day
during operating hours.

16:10.596 --> 16:14.558
We we had no preparation,
but we took advantage of the opportunity.

16:16.310 --> 16:19.313
Pete, Gina, not-Bob...

16:20.564 --> 16:24.109
this is the job that I'll be referencing
the next time you guys have doubts.

16:24.443 --> 16:25.360
This is it.

16:28.489 --> 16:29.364
He's right.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.160
Let's make a crate.

16:33.911 --> 16:34.953
Wrap that shit.

16:35.037 --> 16:35.913
Let's go.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.625
You gotta pass this by Luka.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.126
He doesn't like surprises.

16:41.210 --> 16:43.754
- I'll explain it to him. He'll understand.
- Yeah.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.258
Abso-fucking-lutely not.

16:48.717 --> 16:49.801
Find other way.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.097
There is no other way.

16:54.389 --> 16:56.808
It's this or lose your $11 million.

17:00.354 --> 17:02.564
You think I forget?

17:03.607 --> 17:04.608
Forget what?

17:05.400 --> 17:06.443
You're a con man.

17:09.154 --> 17:10.030
Hm?

17:10.781 --> 17:11.657
This is a set-up.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.534
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Huh?

17:14.117 --> 17:16.620
You think you going to steal

17:16.662 --> 17:18.288
- my fucking money?
- No, I swear to God.

17:18.330 --> 17:20.165
- I swear to God, Luka.
- Luka!

17:20.624 --> 17:22.084
I was there when the call came in.

17:23.043 --> 17:26.046
This is not bullshit.
It's a real fucking problem.

17:30.884 --> 17:34.304
And how you know he is not playing you?

17:35.305 --> 17:36.807
Cos his team was caught off-guard.

17:38.100 --> 17:41.436
They're pissed off, fighting with him.
They don't wanna do it.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.398
They don't wanna do it?

17:45.941 --> 17:47.693
So how you gonna pull this off?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.488
Your team doesn't want to do it.

17:52.948 --> 17:54.783
- You.
- Me? What?

17:55.617 --> 17:57.953
They all know you, your reputation.

17:58.704 --> 17:59.788
They respect you.

18:00.289 --> 18:04.042
If you say go tonight,
they will go tonight.

18:13.302 --> 18:16.388
According to the sign, the bookworm
should've been open two hours ago.

18:18.015 --> 18:19.141
Maybe Pete warned her.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.560
You know, in case you came looking.

18:23.228 --> 18:24.354
You might be right.

18:28.692 --> 18:29.901
Taylor says I'm smart

18:30.736 --> 18:32.070
that I can do anything I want.

18:33.071 --> 18:35.699
I wanna do this,
what we're doing now.

18:35.907 --> 18:38.702
I wanna learn the bail bond business
and take down bad guys.

18:39.661 --> 18:43.624
- Carly...
- Mum did it, and she was good.

18:44.249 --> 18:45.250
Grandpa told me.

18:45.917 --> 18:46.918
I can be good too.

18:47.252 --> 18:49.963
That might be the only thing
that she passed down to me

18:50.047 --> 18:52.841
other than the vague facial resemblance
that I just don't see.

18:55.927 --> 18:58.138
Carly, it's not about
bringing down bad guys.

19:00.515 --> 19:02.267
Most of our clients are good people.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.771
They just made a mistake
and need some help.

19:06.271 --> 19:09.650
But sometimes, we get a chance
to ruin a bad guy's day.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.697
Ah... come on.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.035
Excuse me?

19:20.410 --> 19:21.870
I saw you delivering the mail.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.956
- You know the owner?
- I most certainly do.

19:25.082 --> 19:27.042
For whatever reason, I always get her mail.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.669
Oh, well, maybe you can help me.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.296
Um, my brother's a preacher

19:31.421 --> 19:33.840
has a little church near our home
in Stony Brook.

19:34.257 --> 19:35.509
Collects rare books.

19:35.801 --> 19:37.719
He's quite passionate
about it, right, Carly?

19:37.886 --> 19:39.304
Yeah, yeah, you should see his house.

19:39.388 --> 19:41.014
- Books everywhere.
- Yeah.

19:41.682 --> 19:45.352
I heard this store has
a rare Ben-Hur, 1860.

19:45.686 --> 19:49.231
Normally, they sell first editions,
but this is a third edition

19:49.314 --> 19:51.525
with the erratum on page 116.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.151
- Erratum?
- Oh...

19:53.902 --> 19:55.028
It's a printing error.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.030
I learned the term from my brother.

19:57.489 --> 19:59.908
And Carly wants to give it to him
as a birthday present.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.243
I've been saving up.

20:02.077 --> 20:04.413
Is there any chance
you might have her cellphone number?

20:05.080 --> 20:07.749
It's a long drive from Stony Brook
and I need to get her home

20:07.874 --> 20:10.836
- for cheerleading try-outs.
- No, Grandma, this is way more important.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.170
There's always next year. I...

20:12.379 --> 20:15.257
No, sure, but I can tell you where she is.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.676
Uh, today's her scavenge day.

20:17.759 --> 20:20.387
She goes to this indoor flea market
in Brooklyn

20:21.012 --> 20:23.140
on the corner of Hawthorne and Albany.

20:23.432 --> 20:25.684
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Sure.

20:28.562 --> 20:31.022
- Where did all that come from?
- Movie.

20:32.524 --> 20:35.152
- Wow, Grandma's good at this too.
- Mm-hmm.

20:38.196 --> 20:42.200
Tim, didn't we have an HVAC maintenance
inspection last year?

20:42.367 --> 20:44.619
- We did.
- Our company was bought out.

20:45.454 --> 20:48.081
The new boss is having us do these
once a year now.

20:48.749 --> 20:50.709
He's all about preventative maintenance.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.628
Get me Business Affairs.
We're not paying for a second maintenance.

20:53.670 --> 20:57.090
Oh, you don't have to.
It's included in the current contract.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.052
Get Security.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.681
Have them escort him to the access room.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.726
We wouldn't wanna pass up free service.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.564
- Ah...
- Great.

21:12.647 --> 21:13.523
Ah!

21:15.901 --> 21:17.611
Looks like the float from <i>Animal House.</i>

21:18.779 --> 21:20.280
Everybody's a critic.

21:20.530 --> 21:21.740
Where the fuck is Katie?

21:24.409 --> 21:25.660
That's her calling right now.

21:26.745 --> 21:28.330
Speak of the devil. Where are you?

21:28.455 --> 21:30.332
<i>Heading back to White Plains.</i>

21:30.499 --> 21:34.002
- What?
- I just, I got a call from Amanda's school.

21:34.044 --> 21:36.505
She's sprained her ankle in gym.

21:36.546 --> 21:37.839
I don't know, I have to pick her up.

21:37.923 --> 21:40.258
Well, why... why can't...
why can't Brendon do that?

21:40.342 --> 21:41.468
I'm closer.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.805
OK, look, it's just a sprain.
She's gonna be fine.

21:45.013 --> 21:47.182
$5,000 is gonna help
with the medical expenses.

21:47.307 --> 21:50.602
I hope you never have kids.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.188
Wait, hell...?

21:55.190 --> 21:56.525
Oh, fuck.

22:02.823 --> 22:03.824
Katie bailed.

22:05.575 --> 22:08.119
Marius, without her
getting the casino manager

22:08.245 --> 22:10.664
out of the picture,
you don't get on the floor

22:11.164 --> 22:13.792
- and if you don't get onto the floor--
- Porter, Porter, I know.

22:21.508 --> 22:22.425
Marjorie?

22:22.926 --> 22:24.594
She doesn't wanna have anything
to do with us.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.346
Karolina?

22:27.055 --> 22:28.098
She's in Vegas.

22:33.353 --> 22:34.354
We have Pete.

22:35.105 --> 22:36.189
What?

22:37.315 --> 22:38.817
You want him to be a reporter?

22:39.150 --> 22:41.319
Do you remember him
at dinner with the family?

22:41.820 --> 22:43.780
He has a hard time sticking to the plot.

22:44.114 --> 22:46.741
If anybody has any other ideas,
I'm open to suggestions.

22:48.451 --> 22:51.121
- Anyone?
- Ah, shit.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.167
No.

22:56.334 --> 22:59.212
No, I'm not gonna do well.
I'll fuck it up, just like I did last time.

22:59.254 --> 23:01.339
- I'm not gonna let you down again, Mum.
- Honey, you won't.

23:01.423 --> 23:03.633
You're gonna have an earpiece.

23:03.717 --> 23:05.176
- Yeah, he's gonna coach you...
- I'm gonna coach you

23:05.218 --> 23:06.595
through the whole thing.

23:06.636 --> 23:08.638
But, Mum, I've never run a con before, I...

23:08.763 --> 23:09.723
OK, listen.

23:09.973 --> 23:12.142
The trick is, you use the truth

23:13.351 --> 23:14.644
when you wanna tell a lie.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.438
- What?
- Alright, you're...

23:16.563 --> 23:18.315
you're going in there as Pete Murphy.

23:19.274 --> 23:20.859
But if you need to make something up

23:21.234 --> 23:23.153
you talk about something you know already.

23:24.154 --> 23:25.697
- Mm-hmm.
- Like prison.

23:29.159 --> 23:31.578
It's kinda like prison,
but you put a twist on it.

23:31.661 --> 23:33.038
- Mm-hm.
- You know what I mean?

23:33.496 --> 23:34.372
Right.

23:37.751 --> 23:38.960
OK, how about this?

23:39.669 --> 23:42.505
Like, you know, in prison,
we're... we're behind bars, right?

23:42.881 --> 23:45.926
So... so I say, I say
that I'm a pet store owner

23:46.051 --> 23:47.677
- because animals are in cages.
- No.

23:47.719 --> 23:49.387
- Which is like... the animal are in cages.
- No, stop.

23:49.429 --> 23:50.722
- That's just like a prison.
- Stop, no.

23:50.764 --> 23:51.640
- No, no, no.
- Why?

23:51.681 --> 23:52.849
You don't work at a pet store.

23:52.891 --> 23:54.559
- Well, what do I do?
- I told you.

23:55.101 --> 23:58.188
You're a reporter,
and you're going there to interview Suzanne

23:58.271 --> 23:59.940
- about the Roosevelt buffalo.
- Right.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.524
OK? That's it.

24:01.775 --> 24:04.027
- OK.
- So, when she turns her head

24:04.319 --> 24:06.154
you spike her water with this.

24:06.863 --> 24:09.157
- What is that?
- It's just a concentrated laxative.

24:09.866 --> 24:12.160
What?

24:12.661 --> 24:13.912
- Yeah.
- I give her the shits?

24:13.954 --> 24:15.997
Yeah, she goes home,
she has a rough couple of hours

24:16.039 --> 24:16.915
and then she's fine.

24:16.998 --> 24:18.041
- Marius.
- Yeah?

24:18.291 --> 24:19.250
- What?
- Yes.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.294
- Oh, it's gonna be great.
- It's gonna be great.

24:21.336 --> 24:22.587
Alright, wire him up.

24:36.559 --> 24:37.560
Can I help you?

24:42.065 --> 24:44.275
What are you gonna do with your skip?

24:44.776 --> 24:47.779
I'm gonna get her from the storage
and bring her to jail.

24:48.780 --> 24:51.992
- You'd have to return the fee.
- Better than seeing her killed.

24:54.869 --> 24:57.330
Your Trish isn't big on house-cleaning,
is she?

24:58.415 --> 24:59.290
No.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.459
Don't.

25:01.835 --> 25:02.711
What?

25:02.836 --> 25:05.964
Try to ingratiate yourself
by agreeing with me.

25:06.047 --> 25:08.967
I don't think that's what I was doing.
She's just not big on cleaning.

25:09.926 --> 25:11.177
You're here all day.

25:11.219 --> 25:13.722
What's to prevent you from picking up
a dust rag and pitching in?

25:14.806 --> 25:16.307
Where is this coming from?

25:17.517 --> 25:21.938
Did you tell Taylor that you were with me
because you wanted to rescue me?

25:25.984 --> 25:27.569
No, Taylor said that.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.572
- Was he right?
- Fuck.

25:34.159 --> 25:35.452
I don't know, Julia.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.162
It's all part of the package, right?

25:37.245 --> 25:39.706
I also said you were beautiful,
smart and funny.

25:41.541 --> 25:42.709
Did Taylor mention that?

25:44.169 --> 25:45.086
No.

25:46.755 --> 25:47.797
But he wouldn't.

25:50.258 --> 25:52.135
Why does anybody fall in love with anybody?

25:56.890 --> 26:00.560
Wasn't part of my appeal the fact
that I was a successful lawyer?

26:02.103 --> 26:03.605
And sometimes you made me laugh.

26:07.358 --> 26:08.359
You want a drink?

26:10.612 --> 26:11.488
No.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.075
It's dark enough. I'm gonna go.

26:40.308 --> 26:41.476
It's been fun.

26:47.857 --> 26:48.858
Not really.

26:56.991 --> 26:58.409
You know, I never asked.

27:00.537 --> 27:01.621
Running away...

27:02.413 --> 27:04.207
where were you gonna go?

27:05.542 --> 27:06.668
I'm not sure.

27:11.881 --> 27:13.633
But after that night, I, um...

27:18.388 --> 27:20.890
just wanted some place
to hide away for a while.

27:35.947 --> 27:36.865
Mm.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.449
What's with the earpiece?

27:38.616 --> 27:39.701
<i>Now say...</i>

27:40.326 --> 27:42.245
"I'm waiting on a call from my editor."

27:42.745 --> 27:45.582
Uh, I'm waiting on a call from my editor.

27:45.748 --> 27:46.666
OK.

27:47.292 --> 27:48.585
Um, should we start?

27:49.127 --> 27:51.171
Now, just read her the questions
on your notepad.

27:51.588 --> 27:53.590
- Just read her the questions--
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

27:53.715 --> 27:54.632
I'm sorry?

27:54.841 --> 27:56.384
<i>No, just look at the questions</i>

27:56.426 --> 27:58.011
on your notepad and read them to her.

28:00.138 --> 28:02.307
I'm just gonna read you
the questions on my notepad.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.683
Oh. OK.

28:05.185 --> 28:06.603
Is it true you found out

28:06.644 --> 28:11.274
it was a Teddy Roosevelt buffalo
by accident?

28:12.317 --> 28:14.944
Well, um, around here,
we call accidents "luck."

28:15.570 --> 28:18.907
Good, now ask her the next question,
and then ask for a a cup of water.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.451
Do you think that it will help attract...

28:23.036 --> 28:24.370
more casino guests?

28:25.038 --> 28:27.081
- That's our hope--
- Could I have a glass of water?

28:28.208 --> 28:29.876
Oh, uh, yeah.

28:30.251 --> 28:32.754
Um, let me get you one.

28:37.342 --> 28:38.635
She just walked out.

28:38.676 --> 28:40.303
Good, OK, do it. Do it. Put it in there.

28:41.012 --> 28:42.388
Go, go, go, go, go.

28:43.723 --> 28:44.599
OK.

28:45.683 --> 28:46.559
Oh!

28:47.227 --> 28:48.186
Shit.

28:48.645 --> 28:50.647
Marius, I fucked it.

28:50.980 --> 28:52.690
I knocked over her water.
Ow!

28:52.732 --> 28:53.942
Just like I knew I would.

28:54.025 --> 28:55.151
No, you didn't fuck it up.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.945
You didn't fuck it up. It's OK, Pete.

28:56.986 --> 28:58.238
- It's OK.
- Oh, my God

28:58.279 --> 28:59.739
this is just like the gun range.

29:07.830 --> 29:08.748
Oh, no.

29:11.334 --> 29:12.293
Marius?

29:13.586 --> 29:15.880
- Oh, Marius.
- Who's Marius?

29:18.424 --> 29:20.927
M... Mar... Marius, he's, he's my, um...

29:22.053 --> 29:22.971
Your editor?

29:25.431 --> 29:26.516
Yeah, yeah.

29:26.557 --> 29:27.850
Marius is my editor.

29:30.645 --> 29:31.938
I think he broke his earpiece.

29:32.355 --> 29:34.274
- He what?
- I don't, um... I don't...

29:35.733 --> 29:37.402
I don't know what to say.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.531
What were you doing
with my water bottle?

29:42.949 --> 29:43.908
Oh, um...

29:47.870 --> 29:48.997
Electrolytes.

29:49.580 --> 29:50.456
Yeah.

29:51.165 --> 29:54.085
- If I don't drink enough water, um...
- Oh.

29:54.294 --> 29:57.463
I... I get really dehydrated,
and, and, and, and...

29:57.505 --> 30:00.758
deplete my muscles of electrolytes,
and then, and then I cramp up.

30:01.301 --> 30:02.510
Oh, you were getting a cramp?

30:03.136 --> 30:04.053
Yeah, real bad.

30:06.180 --> 30:07.056
Right here.

30:08.433 --> 30:10.435
It's better now.

30:11.853 --> 30:12.895
I work out a lot.

30:13.896 --> 30:15.231
Spend a lot of time at the yard.

30:16.024 --> 30:17.108
Uh, what yard?

30:18.568 --> 30:20.486
- That's what I call the gym.
- Oh.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.488
Yeah. You definitely work out.

30:22.822 --> 30:24.115
- You're really fit.
- I am?

30:24.198 --> 30:25.533
- Yeah.
- Oh, well, thanks.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.660
Uh, which... what...
what's your programme?

30:28.161 --> 30:30.663
Um... I do CrossFit.

30:31.664 --> 30:33.458
- Lot of leg days.
- Of course.

30:33.916 --> 30:36.002
No, that's, that's obvious.
Your quads are...

30:37.170 --> 30:38.212
they're really defined.

30:38.379 --> 30:39.922
- Oh.
- I'm jealous. Like, mine are OK

30:39.964 --> 30:41.883
- but my calves...
- Oh!

30:41.966 --> 30:44.302
They could definitely use a little work,
you know?

30:44.719 --> 30:45.845
Oh, uh...

30:47.638 --> 30:49.390
I think we should pull
the ripcord on this one.

30:49.432 --> 30:50.725
No. No.

30:50.933 --> 30:52.352
We're not gonna pull the ripcord.

30:52.602 --> 30:55.271
- If she sees us...
- Then I'll think of something, alright?

30:55.355 --> 30:58.941
You have to go, you have to go,
you're on deck, and then it's us. Let's go.

31:08.284 --> 31:09.160
It's me.

31:09.535 --> 31:10.536
Get away from the door.

31:22.423 --> 31:24.217
Valerie, do not fuck with me.

31:24.258 --> 31:26.677
You come charging out,
I will fucking shoot you.

31:34.477 --> 31:37.688
Oh, motherfuck!

31:39.857 --> 31:41.025
Goddamn it!

31:43.361 --> 31:45.321
Good, good, around the corner.
Good, straighten up.

31:48.241 --> 31:49.909
Good. Straight back.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.787
Watch it, watch, watch, watch!

31:53.413 --> 31:54.288
Stop!

31:54.914 --> 31:55.998
Back towards you.

31:56.707 --> 31:58.584
Hey! Hey!

31:59.836 --> 32:00.753
What the hell's going on?

32:02.505 --> 32:03.423
Look at...!

32:04.590 --> 32:07.635
- What's in that thing?
- Oh, it's part of a video installation.

32:07.718 --> 32:08.970
For the Bishop wedding.

32:09.011 --> 32:13.516
See, we're gonna show the couple as babies,
then everyone watches them grow up.

32:13.808 --> 32:16.269
I don't care.
We have service hallways for this.

32:16.727 --> 32:18.271
Get it out of here, now.

32:30.283 --> 32:31.993
- It's Wendy.
<i>- Hey, hon.</i>

32:32.160 --> 32:33.703
- Val?
- I need a ride.

32:33.911 --> 32:36.205
I'm at, uh, Hall Street Storage
in Mount Vernon.

32:36.372 --> 32:37.248
What? Wha...

32:37.582 --> 32:38.666
Hold on one second.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.585
Hey, security guard man,
can you hear me?

32:43.880 --> 32:46.924
Look, the bail bond lady jammed me
in a fucking storage unit.

32:47.508 --> 32:50.136
<i>I need you to go to my house,
bring me some clothes</i>

32:50.636 --> 32:53.055
and bring the bag
with the money and the passport.

32:53.556 --> 32:57.018
<i>- How did you get out?</i>
- I went full fucking ninja is what I did.

32:57.768 --> 32:58.728
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

33:16.704 --> 33:19.624
- Do you have a work order?
- Oh, I do.

33:28.090 --> 33:29.133
I just put this in.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.552
Well, I'm out of New London,
and I was awake.

33:31.594 --> 33:33.304
They wanted it done right away, so...

33:34.305 --> 33:36.557
- How long?
- I'll be out of here in no time.

33:43.814 --> 33:45.942
Yeah, uh, see, it's,
it's the hammer curl

33:46.275 --> 33:49.028
but with the dumbbells, not the barbells.

33:49.278 --> 33:50.571
- Oh!
- That's the trick.

33:50.655 --> 33:51.781
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

33:52.365 --> 33:53.824
C'mere, let me see yours.

33:54.116 --> 33:54.992
No.

33:55.701 --> 33:56.911
Come on, let me see your arm.

34:00.081 --> 34:00.998
Flex.

34:04.085 --> 34:05.294
Oh, my God.

34:06.587 --> 34:07.797
Whoa.

34:09.382 --> 34:10.716
Girl, you're yolked.

34:12.260 --> 34:13.135
Thank you.

34:16.264 --> 34:17.306
Would you like a drink?

34:19.100 --> 34:20.309
That would be awesome.

34:20.393 --> 34:21.269
OK.

34:25.273 --> 34:26.148
OK.

34:32.029 --> 34:33.864
This was a gift from someone.

34:40.079 --> 34:41.539
OK...

34:45.501 --> 34:46.877
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

34:49.297 --> 34:50.172
Mm.

34:51.299 --> 34:53.593
Oh, that is not good.

34:53.634 --> 34:55.761
- It's pretty damn good to me.
- No, no, no. Trust me.

34:56.596 --> 35:00.016
I went to college in the South
and that is not good bourbon.

35:03.811 --> 35:05.521
- I'll be right back.
- I'll be right here.

35:06.272 --> 35:07.148
OK.

35:14.614 --> 35:16.157
Oh, what the fuck?

35:21.787 --> 35:22.663
Shit.

35:27.084 --> 35:27.960
Oh, no.

35:32.131 --> 35:33.257
Oh...

35:35.134 --> 35:36.636
Hey, Grandpa, it's me.

35:36.719 --> 35:40.556
So, uh, little problem, Valerie is missing

35:40.640 --> 35:44.644
and the only place I can think that she might
have gone is her backyard neighbour's house.

35:45.019 --> 35:47.980
Her name is Wendy something.

35:53.110 --> 35:54.153
- No guns.
- What?

35:54.195 --> 35:55.071
Not tonight.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.574
Because Wendy's going to tell me
where to find Valerie.

35:58.949 --> 35:59.867
Aren't you, Wendy?

36:03.412 --> 36:05.831
Wow, it's bigger than I expected.

36:05.998 --> 36:07.375
That's what she said.

36:07.416 --> 36:08.918
That's funny.

36:09.460 --> 36:10.878
I get it. That's funny.

36:13.339 --> 36:17.093
So, hey, are you gonna be driving
all the way back to Hartford tonight?

36:17.301 --> 36:20.346
Oh, um... you know, I don't... I guess so.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.056
Oh.

36:23.015 --> 36:24.183
We could comp you a room.

36:26.936 --> 36:29.897
Tim, why don't you see about
comping Mr Murphy a room?

36:30.147 --> 36:32.441
Uh, I thought that was reserved
for our Gold Circle.

36:32.775 --> 36:34.151
Don't be such a stick in the mud.

36:38.739 --> 36:39.657
He's so...

36:43.244 --> 36:44.120
Are you OK?

36:46.831 --> 36:47.915
Excuse me.

36:57.091 --> 36:58.551
I hope she's OK.

36:59.093 --> 37:00.344
Uh, we can reschedule?

37:01.095 --> 37:02.179
You know, I, uh...

37:02.847 --> 37:04.932
I got everything I needed.

37:06.225 --> 37:07.101
I gotta go.

37:07.518 --> 37:08.394
Marius.

37:08.436 --> 37:10.896
Don't look for us,
and don't look at your mother.

37:14.316 --> 37:15.568
Pete, you know what you are?

37:16.318 --> 37:17.695
Oh, uh, I'm a...

37:18.529 --> 37:19.780
You're a fucking hero.

37:20.489 --> 37:21.615
<i>Now get out of here.</i>

37:27.538 --> 37:28.414
Go.

37:29.123 --> 37:30.624
I'm a little busy.

37:30.666 --> 37:33.252
That big Indian guy
who works for Dockery is looking for you.

37:34.378 --> 37:36.380
- What?
- He asked Trish where you were.

37:36.797 --> 37:38.048
<i>How did he know to ask Trish?</i>

37:38.382 --> 37:40.092
That's really not important right now.

37:40.217 --> 37:44.972
Oh, so, Dockery saw you two together
back when you were representing him

37:46.432 --> 37:49.894
- and I guess Trish told him where I am?
<i>- Yeah, look.</i>

37:49.977 --> 37:52.188
He scared the shit out of her
half an hour ago.

37:52.271 --> 37:53.898
He could've followed
you when you left here.

38:13.542 --> 38:15.503
- Uh, can I help you?
- Yeah, hey.

38:16.754 --> 38:18.422
Uh, I hope so.
It depends on who you are.

38:18.589 --> 38:21.342
- I'm the deputy assistant casino manager.
- Oh, so they called you.

38:21.884 --> 38:22.760
Who called me?

38:23.260 --> 38:25.137
They didn't call you.
I told you they didn't call him.

38:25.179 --> 38:28.599
Uh, yeah, well, facilities got a...
an emergency phone call from Corporate.

38:28.641 --> 38:30.810
They wanted a bank of slot machines
behind the buffalo.

38:31.477 --> 38:34.522
I guess, in case, you know
it's not all it's all cracked up to be

38:34.605 --> 38:36.941
they wanna have foot traffic with the money
and the whole, you know...

38:37.024 --> 38:38.859
- OK, Suzanne, my boss.
- Yeah.

38:38.901 --> 38:40.444
She's the one who approves
this type of order.

38:41.487 --> 38:42.947
- Can you get her?
- She's...

38:43.113 --> 38:44.949
she's unavailable right now.

38:47.660 --> 38:49.495
So you know the security
behind these things, right?

38:49.537 --> 38:51.789
We either gotta plant it
or we gotta bring it all the way back.

38:52.039 --> 38:56.126
It's, like, a mile back to the...
You know what I'm thinking, uh, Tim?

38:56.293 --> 38:57.461
I'm thinking maybe...

38:57.503 --> 39:00.047
it's time for you to step up
and make a decision on your own, right?

39:00.130 --> 39:03.759
OK, but I don't...
I don't make decisions on my own.

39:05.511 --> 39:07.054
You don't make decisions on your own?

39:07.680 --> 39:08.931
If we have to take these back

39:08.973 --> 39:10.766
- you're calling him.
- I'm not calling. You're calling.

39:10.808 --> 39:12.601
- Sorry, who you calling?
- Our boss.

39:12.726 --> 39:14.395
If we don't, we get our asses chewed.

39:14.603 --> 39:16.438
If we do call him, we get our asses chewed.

39:16.564 --> 39:20.109
Alright, fine, just, uh... leave it here
for right now, but don't go anywhere

39:21.026 --> 39:22.194
- OK?
- OK.

39:31.996 --> 39:33.873
- Yeah?
<i>- Julia's skip is missing</i>

39:33.998 --> 39:36.458
<i>from her storage locker
so Sammy and I are gonna go.</i>

39:37.084 --> 39:39.879
We're gonna go check on
her neighbour, Wendy.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.088
<i>What are you up to?</i>

39:41.171 --> 39:43.173
Uh, we've been looking
for that English woman.

39:43.299 --> 39:45.134
- Yeah?
<i>- Yeah, Carly's been helping.</i>

39:45.301 --> 39:46.927
She's on a scout, as we speak.

39:47.887 --> 39:49.263
You got Carly working this?

39:49.430 --> 39:50.723
Otto, she's doing a scout

39:51.056 --> 39:53.475
and how old was I
when you started putting me to work?

39:53.559 --> 39:54.643
<i>No, no, no.</i>

39:54.894 --> 39:57.146
That was different. You're you.

39:57.730 --> 39:59.148
And Carly's not a kid anymore.

39:59.690 --> 40:01.358
<i>I know, I... I just worry.</i>

40:01.609 --> 40:07.114
Look, I... I know this woman's a Brit,
but she's also a con artist, right?

40:07.740 --> 40:08.782
It's dangerous.

40:09.408 --> 40:11.493
I just wanted you to have backup.

40:12.036 --> 40:13.162
Otto, what have you done?

40:13.913 --> 40:15.915
Reach under the driver's seat.

40:23.964 --> 40:24.924
What?

40:25.507 --> 40:29.261
Only in this family could something
like this count as a romantic gesture.

40:40.814 --> 40:41.899
Can I help you?

40:42.483 --> 40:43.359
Um...

40:43.984 --> 40:45.986
Do you, uh, have any Hardy Boys?

40:46.362 --> 40:48.238
My dad... he collects them.

40:48.405 --> 40:51.033
I love the Hardy Boys.
If we do, they're over there.

40:51.492 --> 40:52.368
Thanks.

41:00.751 --> 41:04.672
Hey, Dad.
Yeah, I'm at this... I'm at the flea market

41:04.797 --> 41:08.133
and, um, I'm looking for those, uh...

41:08.300 --> 41:12.012
blue spines, and I'm just, um,
not seeing them.

41:13.055 --> 41:14.098
Yeah, no, I'll, um...

41:14.139 --> 41:17.434
just do a little more digging.

41:20.312 --> 41:21.188
Bye.

41:23.148 --> 41:24.024
Thank you.

41:36.453 --> 41:38.414
Oh! Goddamn it!

41:38.497 --> 41:41.166
Get the... give me my chips.
Give me my chips.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.377
All my life savings right there.

41:43.585 --> 41:46.505
Kid, you better give me my chips,
before I take this wheelchair

41:46.588 --> 41:49.216
and wrap it around your ass!
Come on, give me my chips!

42:23.125 --> 42:24.043
Shit.

42:24.334 --> 42:26.587
Hey, buddy, you got a leak.

42:32.968 --> 42:34.261
Aw, fuck me.

42:41.518 --> 42:42.394
Ahem.

42:42.895 --> 42:44.229
Check it out, Cheetos are back.

42:45.022 --> 42:46.774
You want one? It's on me.

42:47.483 --> 42:49.485
- We need to talk.
- OK.

42:49.902 --> 42:50.778
What's up?

42:51.987 --> 42:54.531
The results came back on the blood
we found from Winslow's car.

42:54.573 --> 42:57.284
Belongs to a post-menopausal
Caucasian woman.

42:59.578 --> 43:00.454
OK.

43:02.039 --> 43:04.583
I'm gonna need a cheek swab
from your grandmother to test for DNA.

43:05.084 --> 43:07.252
- Oh, my God...
- I want her to do it voluntarily

43:07.294 --> 43:09.671
but if she refuses,
I'll compel her with a court order.

43:10.589 --> 43:12.466
- OK.
- Just wanted to give you a heads up.

43:37.616 --> 43:40.702
- How'd you know I'd come out the back?
- Skip tracer 101.

43:41.703 --> 43:43.914
- So the girl's out front?
- Granddaughter.

43:44.623 --> 43:45.791
It's family business.

43:47.876 --> 43:49.336
What if I had a gun, Audrey?

43:50.170 --> 43:52.422
I saw the pictures she took
of that stupid purse.

43:53.382 --> 43:55.634
Unless you have a derringer,
I wasn't worried.

43:57.136 --> 43:59.054
My bag, however...

44:07.187 --> 44:09.273
Are you sure this
is the right Wendy?

44:09.773 --> 44:12.109
That's what my guy
over at Records says.

44:12.234 --> 44:13.318
Oh, dearie me...

44:15.904 --> 44:17.281
Otto!

44:17.406 --> 44:18.365
Jesus!
