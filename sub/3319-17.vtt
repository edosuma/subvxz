00:02.001 --> 00:03.046
Previously onMom...

00:03.133 --> 00:04.003
So, Regina,
tell us about you.

00:04.091 --> 00:06.658
I'm a money manager.

00:06.745 --> 00:07.920
People trust me
with millions of dollars.

00:08.007 --> 00:10.445
So, yeah,

00:10.532 --> 00:13.796
maybe I like to take the edge
off at the end of the day

00:13.883 --> 00:16.451
with a couple bottles of wine.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.931
Few shots of tequila.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.759
Fistful of muscle relaxers.

00:22.283 --> 00:25.373
I'm dating this sweet, smart,

00:25.460 --> 00:29.725
smokin' hot guy
who's just a train wreck.

00:31.509 --> 00:32.075
Can I ask you something?

00:32.162 --> 00:34.338
Sure.

00:34.425 --> 00:36.775
Are sober people
allowed to do coke?

00:38.995 --> 00:41.432
You know how I told you people
trust me with their money?

00:41.519 --> 00:42.477
Yeah.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.044
They shouldn't.

00:45.219 --> 00:46.872
I embezzled from my clients.

00:46.959 --> 00:49.658
Why?

00:49.745 --> 00:51.399
What kind of
question is that?

00:51.486 --> 00:52.617
What's a better question?

00:52.704 --> 00:54.880
How?

00:54.967 --> 00:56.708
Anyway...

00:56.795 --> 01:00.582
The real reason I came here
tonight was...

01:00.669 --> 01:03.846
I think the police might be
waiting for me at my house.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.198
I can't believe
they found you guilty.

01:08.285 --> 01:10.070
I can. I stole $3 million.

01:12.376 --> 01:14.596
Kind of gives you faith
in the legal system.

01:14.683 --> 01:15.249
[laughs]

01:15.336 --> 01:17.860
Shut up.

01:17.947 --> 01:20.645
So what
happens next?

01:20.732 --> 01:22.169
There's a sentencing hearing.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.084
I'm hoping the judge
will go easy on me

01:24.171 --> 01:25.781
'cause I've been
turning my life around.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.174
Have you?Don't push me, Chopstick.

01:30.438 --> 01:31.613
Maybe they'll send you
to one of those

01:31.700 --> 01:33.093
swanky
country club jails.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.791
Get real. I'm a black woman

01:35.878 --> 01:37.575
who embezzled money
from white people.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.925
I'm going to jailjail.

01:40.012 --> 01:41.971
Someone's gonna buy my ass
for a Kit Kat bar.

01:42.058 --> 01:44.495
Well, it's only fair.

01:44.582 --> 01:47.846
Kit Kat bars helped
build that thing.

01:47.933 --> 01:51.023
My lawyer said it might help if
I had some character witnesses.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.287
Oh, so you need people
who can testify to how you've

01:53.374 --> 01:55.463
turned into a productive
member of society.

01:55.550 --> 01:58.422
Yeah.Yikes.

01:58.509 --> 02:02.339
Well, it wouldn't be the first
time I've lied under oath.

02:02.426 --> 02:04.167
Thanks, but I was kind of hoping
for someone a little less...

02:04.254 --> 02:06.561
sketchy.

02:06.648 --> 02:10.042
That's funny.
Sketchy was my street name.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.696
What about you, Christy?

02:11.783 --> 02:14.569
Oh, I'm not
squeaky clean, either.

02:14.656 --> 02:16.179
Especially not in Nevada.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.790
And parts of Utah.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.183
I'm not allowed
to travel abroad.

02:20.270 --> 02:23.621
It's not
a competition, Mom.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.623
You'll
be great.

02:25.710 --> 02:28.235
Just look at the judge like one
of those big-eyed kid paintings.

02:28.322 --> 02:29.410
He'll eat it up.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.151
You think?Oh. Show me.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.547
Open your mouth a little, so you
look like you're about to cry.

02:39.115 --> 02:42.423
Tell me that doesn't look
like house arrest to you.

02:43.641 --> 02:46.166
Come on, I can do that.

02:50.300 --> 02:54.435
You look like someone
who just huffed some paint.

02:54.522 --> 02:55.784
Okay, for that,
you're buying.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.177
Mom. She's
going to prison.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.656
Where she will eat for free.

02:58.743 --> 03:01.050
Come on, we're gonna
be late for the meeting.

03:01.137 --> 03:04.096
Oh, actually,
I can't make it.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.620
I've got to help
a friend move.

03:05.707 --> 03:06.621
Who's the friend?

03:06.708 --> 03:07.752
Do you know Denise?

03:07.839 --> 03:08.840
No.

03:08.927 --> 03:11.582
It's Denise.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.062
Catch you later.

03:15.586 --> 03:16.935
Your daughter's
an amazing woman.

03:17.022 --> 03:19.286
She's a lying whore.

03:19.373 --> 03:21.505
What?There's no Denise.
She's going to see

03:21.592 --> 03:22.071
her pothead boyfriend.

03:22.158 --> 03:24.552
Wow.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.336
All I saw was the big eyes.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.164
She's gonna be great
on the stand.

03:28.251 --> 03:30.297
You ready to go?

03:30.384 --> 03:33.256
Let me just use
the ladies' room.

03:33.343 --> 03:34.692
Why don't you just take a leak

03:34.779 --> 03:35.345
right here
in front of everybody?

03:35.432 --> 03:37.913
What?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.175
You're going to prison, you
might as well get used to it.

You asleep?

04:01.632 --> 04:03.068
No.

04:03.155 --> 04:06.550
Just enjoying the moment.

04:06.637 --> 04:08.987
Me, too.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.293
If I tell you something,

04:10.380 --> 04:11.729
you promise you
won't freak out?

04:11.816 --> 04:15.646
I'll try. Am I gonna
need antibiotics?

04:17.344 --> 04:19.433
No.

04:19.519 --> 04:23.828
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

04:23.915 --> 04:26.440
Oh.

04:26.527 --> 04:29.530
You freaked out?

04:29.617 --> 04:30.922
That depends.

04:31.009 --> 04:33.142
How high are you right now?

04:33.229 --> 04:36.188
On a scale of Woody Harrelson
to Willie Nelson.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.322
Snoop Dogg.

04:39.409 --> 04:41.411
So you might not
remember this.

04:41.498 --> 04:44.022
I'll remember.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.113
Traditionally,
this is where you say

04:48.200 --> 04:50.159
you're falling
in love with me.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.380
Oh, God.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.338
I might be.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.297
Good.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.821
[soft laugh]

05:01.997 --> 05:03.215
Mmm.Mmm.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.695
You ready for round two?

05:04.782 --> 05:06.131
Mm. I am.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.655
But I have to go to work.

05:07.742 --> 05:10.310
No, don't go, stay.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.617
I'll make us waffles, I'll
read you some of my poetry.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.445
Seriously?

05:15.532 --> 05:17.926
I've got a fireman
who writes poetry?

05:18.013 --> 05:21.364
I prefer to think of myself
as a poet who puts out fires.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.410
Damn you.

05:23.497 --> 05:25.325
What are you doing?

05:25.412 --> 05:27.370
Calling in sick.

05:30.504 --> 05:31.548
[husky voice]:
Gabriel.

05:31.635 --> 05:34.116
It's Christy.

05:34.203 --> 05:36.423
I-I think I got that thing
that's going around.

05:36.510 --> 05:39.991
So I won't be in today,
maybe tomorrow. Bye.

05:41.036 --> 05:42.820
[laughs, sighs]

05:42.907 --> 05:45.214
All right, I'm all yours.

05:45.301 --> 05:48.086
Do that sick voice again.
I think it's kind of sexy.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.219
[husky]: Kiss me.Nope, I was wrong.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.063
Hey.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.108
Hey, where you been?

06:10.195 --> 06:12.023
What do you mean,
where have I been?

06:12.110 --> 06:13.721
Work.

06:13.808 --> 06:16.071
[sighs]
What are you doing?

06:16.158 --> 06:17.333
Frosting cupcakes.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.117
What's the occasion?

06:19.204 --> 06:21.990
It's You Signed Up
to be Snack Mom and Forgot Day.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.471
Oh.

06:24.558 --> 06:27.604
Nope, forgetful mothers
do not get snacks.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.825
You know...

06:30.912 --> 06:32.653
cupcakes aren't a
very healthy choice.

06:32.740 --> 06:35.482
Neither is criticizing me
for doing your freakin' job.

06:37.179 --> 06:39.790
Why don't I just finish
that up for you?

06:39.877 --> 06:41.836
Fine.

06:45.013 --> 06:45.622
So, a long night, huh?

06:45.709 --> 06:48.538
Ugh, brutal.

06:48.625 --> 06:51.106
I'm really thinking
about going back to school.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.282
I cannot wait tables
my entire life.

06:53.369 --> 06:54.892
Good for you.Yeah,

06:54.979 --> 06:58.069
I'm tired of spending
ten hours a day on my feet.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.420
You sure you don't
mean on your back?

07:03.205 --> 07:04.902
What?

07:04.989 --> 07:07.252
Gabriel called to say
he's sorry you missed work

07:07.339 --> 07:09.341
and hopes you're feeling better.

07:14.782 --> 07:18.046
So what are you thinking
about studying in school?

07:20.004 --> 07:20.744
[sighs]

07:20.831 --> 07:22.920
All right, fine.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.009
I blew off work
and spent the night with David.

07:25.096 --> 07:26.533
But why lie about it?

07:26.620 --> 07:29.057
'Cause I'm kind of a liar.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.062
Is that where you were
when you missed

07:34.149 --> 07:35.672
your daughter's Lamaze
class yesterday?

07:35.759 --> 07:38.980
Oh, no, was that yesterday?Don't worry,

07:39.067 --> 07:40.460
I covered for you.

07:40.547 --> 07:41.504
20 women going...
[quick, short breaths]

07:41.591 --> 07:43.941
...for a freakin' hour.

07:44.028 --> 07:46.640
It sounded like Japanese porn.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.297
You are the best grandmother.

07:52.384 --> 07:56.519
Yeah, only because
you're the worst mother.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.739
Look, I am not gonna tell you
how to live your life,

07:58.826 --> 08:00.741
but you're screwing up.
You are in over your head

08:00.828 --> 08:02.873
with this guy,
you need to snap out of it.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.659
I thought you weren't gonna
tell me how to live my life?

08:05.746 --> 08:08.052
You're not the only liar
in this room.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.839
It just so happens that

08:11.926 --> 08:14.015
that guy told me
he loves me tonight.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.583
Oh, well, love.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.543
That changes everything.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.720
You deserve a cupcake.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.989
[exhales]

08:37.038 --> 08:39.039
Not bad.

08:42.913 --> 08:45.612
Oh, I can't
promise anything,

08:45.699 --> 08:47.875
but I'll try.

08:47.962 --> 08:52.314
Yeah, I miss you, too.

08:52.401 --> 08:52.749
Hey, you sound
a lot better.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.014
[husky]:
It comes and goes.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.234
Well, I'm glad you're back.

08:59.321 --> 09:00.496
Please wash your hands.

09:00.583 --> 09:01.802
A lot.

09:04.631 --> 09:08.809
Hey, Paul, is Rudy still
selling weed on the side?

09:08.896 --> 09:10.811
RUDY:
Oh, uh, yes.

09:10.898 --> 09:14.162
Oh, hey, didn't see you there.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.642
Step into my office.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.078
You do it in the freezer?

09:17.165 --> 09:19.123
Cold people don't haggle.

09:21.648 --> 09:25.173
So, would you like
to hear the specials?

09:25.260 --> 09:27.349
Okay.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.960
Tonight we have
a locally produced Sonoma Kush

09:30.047 --> 09:33.660
which pairs very well
with a lovely 1978 Quaalude.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.881
No, just the Kush.

09:37.968 --> 09:40.667
Good choice. So what are we
thinking, half a kilo?

09:40.754 --> 09:44.279
No, just a couple of joints.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.716
Are you kidding me?

09:46.803 --> 09:50.546
I'm freezing my balls off
for a couple of joints? Look,

09:50.633 --> 09:53.549
Paul handles the
nickel-and-dime crap.W-Wait, wait, uh,

09:53.636 --> 09:56.030
this stays just between
you and me, right?

09:56.117 --> 09:58.380
Absolutely. I will
protect your reputation.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.556
Oh, what are
you looking at?

10:00.643 --> 10:02.602
Yes, I'm banging
the little blonde.

10:06.431 --> 10:07.868
[sighs]

10:07.955 --> 10:08.651
What the hell am I doing?

10:08.738 --> 10:10.653
Christy.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.873
Yeah?! Hi! Who?!

10:12.960 --> 10:14.526
Oh, Regina.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.790
You scared the crap out of me.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.748
I need a favor and I
didn't want to bother
you in the restaurant.

10:18.835 --> 10:21.795
Oh, so you decided to give me a
heart attack in the parking lot?

10:21.882 --> 10:24.275
Here, take this.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.538
While I'm in prison, I want
you to hold it for me.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.410
What's in it?

10:28.497 --> 10:32.022
I don't think that concerns you.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.850
Oh, my God, is this some
of the money you stole?

10:33.937 --> 10:35.547
No, that's money I earned.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.680
But the Feds will take it
if they know I have it.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.073
How'd you earn it?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.901
Selling Mary Kay cosmetics.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.685
Now... are you still good
for being my character witness

10:42.772 --> 10:44.948
in court tomorrow?

10:45.035 --> 10:47.995
Yeah, yeah, sure.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.474
Should I bring the box

10:49.561 --> 10:51.085
of stolen money with me?

10:51.172 --> 10:53.870
No. You can leave it
and the sarcasm at home.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.480
Just...

10:55.567 --> 10:57.004
tell the judge how
I've turned my life around

10:57.091 --> 10:58.745
and that I'm a fine,
upstanding citizen.

10:58.832 --> 11:01.182
Got it.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.226
