WEBVTT

02:17.167 --> 02:18.042
No.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.917
Can I get you anything else?

02:20.917 --> 02:21.792
I'm fine.

02:27.667 --> 02:28.667
Boop.

02:28.667 --> 02:29.792
Oh, my god!

02:29.792 --> 02:31.875
Oh, thank God you came!

02:31.875 --> 02:33.042
Oh, my god, are
you kidding me?

02:33.042 --> 02:34.917
I wouldn't miss
this for the world!

02:34.917 --> 02:35.875
- Ugh.
- It's your big day!

02:35.875 --> 02:38.042
Oh, my gosh, look at how
many people are here.

02:38.042 --> 02:40.042
I know, it's really weird.

02:40.042 --> 02:41.542
- Let's take an SC.
- Okay.

02:41.542 --> 02:42.250
Okay.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.667
Looks really good.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.667
Where's Marcus?

02:49.667 --> 02:50.917
He should be here any minute-

02:51.792 --> 02:53.250
Oh. This is him.

02:53.250 --> 02:55.000
I'll
hold one second.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.292
Hey, babe. Are
you on your way?

02:58.292 --> 03:00.542
I'm so, so sorry.

03:01.375 --> 03:03.000
I just landed in New York.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.167
We had an emergency on
board and got delayed.

03:05.167 --> 03:06.042
I...

03:07.000 --> 03:08.917
It looks like I won't
be there in time.

03:11.167 --> 03:12.042
Babe?

03:14.875 --> 03:15.750
Yeah, I'm here.

03:17.125 --> 03:18.542
It's fine. Really.

03:20.917 --> 03:22.125
I'm sorry.

03:22.125 --> 03:23.167
I'll keep you posted.

03:24.125 --> 03:25.042
I'll see you at home.

03:25.042 --> 03:26.375
Okay. Bye.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.750
Let's toast.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.750
Let's.

03:31.750 --> 03:33.750
To my amazing sister.

03:33.750 --> 03:35.667
- Mm.
- A once art history teacher.

03:35.667 --> 03:37.667
Now, world famous painter.

03:38.792 --> 03:41.792
Cheers.

03:44.167 --> 03:45.750
Whoa.

03:47.917 --> 03:49.625
What is it? What's the matter?

03:51.292 --> 03:52.625
Marcus isn't coming.

03:52.625 --> 03:53.917
- What?
- I don't know.

03:53.917 --> 03:55.667
He said that he's
still at the airport

03:55.667 --> 03:56.917
and he's never gonna
make it on time.

03:56.917 --> 03:58.625
And he's only just
now telling you this?

03:58.625 --> 03:59.250
This is your day!

03:59.250 --> 04:00.167
Rebecca, stop.

04:00.917 --> 04:03.667
I don't wanna get more
upset than I already am.

04:03.667 --> 04:05.292
It's fine.
No, it isn't.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.667
I'm really tired.

04:12.667 --> 04:16.167
You know, I've been
slaving away for this,

04:16.167 --> 04:20.292
away from you, away from my
husband, away from everyone.

04:20.292 --> 04:22.917
And I've been here
all fucking day.

04:22.917 --> 04:24.917
I don't know anyone here.

04:24.917 --> 04:25.917
And I just...

04:26.917 --> 04:27.792
What?

04:27.792 --> 04:29.917
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

04:29.917 --> 04:31.042
What?

04:31.042 --> 04:32.792
I forgot Pepper's medication.

04:32.792 --> 04:34.167
Honey, Pepper will be fine.

04:34.167 --> 04:35.417
No, no, no, no, no.

04:35.417 --> 04:36.292
The vet said I have
to give it to him.

04:36.292 --> 04:37.917
I...

04:37.917 --> 04:39.375
You know what,
I'm gonna go home.

04:39.375 --> 04:41.125
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- I'm gonna go.

04:41.125 --> 04:43.417
No, you're not going
anywhere. Don't be ridiculous.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.792
Look, I'll go home.

04:44.792 --> 04:46.000
I'll give Pepper

04:46.000 --> 04:46.792
his medication.
No, I'm not gonna

04:46.792 --> 04:47.875
make you do that.

04:47.875 --> 04:49.292
What? No, it's fine.

04:49.292 --> 04:52.292
I'll be right back and
we will celebrate you.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.875
Properly, okay?

04:53.875 --> 04:54.875
Julie.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.417
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:58.667 --> 05:01.167
I would like to introduce you
to those people over there.

05:01.167 --> 05:02.417
They love your art.

05:02.417 --> 05:03.750
- Oh.
- And they're so excited

05:03.750 --> 05:05.000
to meet you.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.125
And most importantly, they're
ready to write you a check.

05:08.125 --> 05:10.875
Um, uh, okay.
I'll be one second.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.000
Just one.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Okay, okay, you
stay, you mingle,

05:16.000 --> 05:17.750
and you get the monies.

05:17.750 --> 05:18.875
And I'll be right
back, all right?

05:18.875 --> 05:20.000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:21.125 --> 05:22.375
- Mwah.
- All right, security code.

05:22.375 --> 05:23.292
Same?
Still the same, yeah, yeah.

05:23.292 --> 05:24.792
Mwah. See you later.

05:29.042 --> 05:29.917
Okay.

05:31.042 --> 05:33.792
Let's make some money.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.292
Hi.
Hi, how are you?

05:35.292 --> 05:36.417
Hey.

05:57.250 --> 06:00.000
Pepper, you little shit.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.125
You scared me.

06:02.042 --> 06:03.167
Yes, you did.

06:03.167 --> 06:05.167
Oh, you're so cute.

06:26.917 --> 06:28.250
Get off of me!

06:28.250 --> 06:30.917
Get off me!

07:02.292 --> 07:04.250
911.
What's your emergency?

07:05.250 --> 07:06.125
Hello?

07:07.250 --> 07:09.917
911. What's your emergency?

07:09.917 --> 07:13.917
Hello?

07:24.042 --> 07:25.500
How is it healing?

07:28.875 --> 07:31.042
Uh, it's okay.

07:31.042 --> 07:32.500
Pain meds help.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.417
Another reason why not
to mix pills and alcohol.

07:35.417 --> 07:37.375
I didn't trip
because I was high,

07:37.375 --> 07:40.292
I tripped because of your
stupid robot vacuum cleaner.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Look, I'm worried. She's
mixing pills and alcohol again.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.542
I have a lot of anxiety
and I'm not sleeping.

07:48.542 --> 07:51.500
Julie, we've
talked about this.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.917
I know you need
to take some pills

07:53.917 --> 07:58.500
for your pain and for your
anxiety, but until you heal,

07:58.500 --> 08:01.167
it would be best if you
didn't drink any alcohol.

08:01.167 --> 08:02.875
It really is dangerous.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.042
The break-in,
it was a tragedy.

08:05.042 --> 08:08.125
And Rebecca, she didn't
deserve to die that way,

08:08.125 --> 08:10.167
but it has been five months

08:10.167 --> 08:11.875
and I would like my
wife back, you know?

08:11.875 --> 08:13.042
She needs to...

08:14.542 --> 08:17.417
We need to move on.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.875
Should have been
me that night.

08:23.375 --> 08:25.417
I understand.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.375
You feel your guilt.

08:27.375 --> 08:31.167
And it is a natural
reaction to the situation.

08:31.167 --> 08:35.417
Grief is a process
layered with emotions,

08:35.417 --> 08:37.667
and in order to get through it,

08:37.667 --> 08:41.000
you have to accept and
deal with those emotions.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.375
It is going to take some time.

08:43.667 --> 08:44.625
You will get there.

08:45.542 --> 08:46.917
Yeah, no, I understand that.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.500
You know, it was
really hard being

08:48.500 --> 08:52.500
in our place after
what happened, so I
got us a new place,

08:52.500 --> 08:54.750
somewhere nice and quiet
where Julie can paint

08:54.750 --> 08:56.000
and, you know, I
can work from there-

08:56.000 --> 08:59.417
And I said that I don't feel
comfortable moving right now.

09:01.375 --> 09:06.167
Well, um, relocating
to a new house could help

09:06.167 --> 09:07.917
with the healing process.

09:09.417 --> 09:13.417
A new environment could
give you a new perspective

09:13.417 --> 09:16.500
and help you separate
the traumatic event

09:16.500 --> 09:18.917
that happened to your sister

09:18.917 --> 09:21.375
from the actual
loss of your sister.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.167
I don't like the
idea of being out

09:25.167 --> 09:27.042
in the middle of nowhere.

09:27.042 --> 09:28.417
Alone.

09:28.417 --> 09:30.417
Yeah, but you won't be alone.

09:31.417 --> 09:33.042
You know, I can work from home.

09:33.042 --> 09:36.250
I can be there to get you
anything that you need.

09:36.250 --> 09:38.292
You know, I can
finish working on Hera

09:38.292 --> 09:40.625
and maybe you'll get
inspired to paint and...

09:40.625 --> 09:44.500
Hera, that's his little
toy that plays music

09:44.500 --> 09:46.375
and turns on the lights
when you ask it to,

09:46.375 --> 09:49.667
but when you actually
need it, it's useless.

09:49.667 --> 09:51.625
Okay, first off,
it's not a toy.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.792
And secondly, the
version that we had was

09:53.792 --> 09:55.125
my first prototype, okay?

09:55.125 --> 09:57.667
We don't know what
went wrong, exactly.

09:57.667 --> 10:01.000
Okay, you have no idea what
this new upgrade is capable of.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.542
She can change our lives.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.292
He's making a big effort here.

10:05.417 --> 10:07.167
Can you just meet
him halfway? Hmm?

10:15.417 --> 10:17.542
I think this could
be really good for us.

10:19.667 --> 10:21.167
And I will be
there to help you,

10:21.167 --> 10:24.375
both, through this transition.

10:28.542 --> 10:30.417
Hey. Julie.

10:49.292 --> 10:52.042
How you liking
the new place so far?

10:52.042 --> 10:53.000
It's nice.

10:54.375 --> 10:55.667
You know, there's still
a few things to unpack,

10:55.667 --> 10:58.000
but I figure we can
take our time with that.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.500
I'm glad we're doing this.

11:02.167 --> 11:02.792
Me too.

11:28.875 --> 11:31.375
You won't have to lift
a finger, I promise.

11:31.375 --> 11:32.250
Okay.

11:44.250 --> 11:47.250
Oh, god, there's so many boxes.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.417
Can't wait until

11:48.417 --> 11:49.250
we get unpacked.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.667
Yeah, we'll get there.

11:50.667 --> 11:52.792
Oh, you're gonna
love the new Hera.

11:52.792 --> 11:53.667
Mm-hmm.

11:57.125 --> 11:58.542
Who's that?

11:58.542 --> 11:59.750
It's Sophie.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.542
Um, I'm gonna go upstairs,

12:01.542 --> 12:02.625
but you let me know
when you're ready?

12:02.625 --> 12:04.167
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Okay.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.125
Hi.
Hey, how's it going?

12:08.125 --> 12:09.667
I have been dying
over here for details.

12:09.667 --> 12:12.125
You left so mysteriously.

12:12.125 --> 12:14.250
I know. It's good, it's good.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.042
I mean, the house
is really nice.

12:17.292 --> 12:18.750
I just can't wait until
we're unpacked though

12:18.750 --> 12:21.167
because there's shit everywhere.

12:21.167 --> 12:24.417
So you decided which room
you're gonna have sex in first?

12:24.417 --> 12:25.875
Sophie, come on.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.375
You guys still
aren't getting along?

12:27.375 --> 12:29.792
Hey, you know, the best solution

12:29.792 --> 12:33.792
to, mm, everything
is a good orgasm.

12:34.792 --> 12:36.417
- Really?
- Yes, really.

12:36.417 --> 12:38.417
How the hell do you think
I've been married so long?

12:38.417 --> 12:41.292
I don't know, Soph, I just...

12:41.292 --> 12:43.292
I feel so...

12:44.667 --> 12:46.792
Hey, you are not alone.

12:46.792 --> 12:49.792
I am here for you. Just make
the most of your time together.

12:49.792 --> 12:51.417
Okay.

12:51.417 --> 12:53.417
I will. Thanks, Soph.

12:53.417 --> 12:54.292
Bye.
Bye.

12:59.375 --> 13:00.250
Okay.

13:01.875 --> 13:02.667
Working.

13:03.917 --> 13:07.417
Hey, Jules, come downstairs.
I wanna show you something.

13:07.417 --> 13:08.292
Okay.

13:11.292 --> 13:13.667
Um, let me see your phone?

13:13.667 --> 13:14.542
- Okay.
- Yeah.

13:15.750 --> 13:20.542
I just wanna make sure that you
are connected to everything.

13:20.542 --> 13:21.667
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

13:22.917 --> 13:23.792
Okay.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.292
This is Hera.

13:28.292 --> 13:29.875
She controls all the apps
and the alarm system.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.167
Now, when you leave the
house, it'll turn on.

13:32.167 --> 13:33.417
Okay.

13:33.417 --> 13:35.292
And, you know, if you're home
alone, you can leave it on.

13:35.292 --> 13:38.500
But if a window or a door
opens, the alarm will go off.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.917
And if you don't turn it
off within five minutes,

13:39.917 --> 13:42.292
Hera will get the cops
to come and check on you.

13:42.292 --> 13:43.417
Okay, that's good.

13:43.417 --> 13:44.792
Good, good, now, you can lock

13:44.792 --> 13:47.292
and unlock the doors
from your phone

13:47.292 --> 13:49.792
or, you know, the
tablet, the wall panels.

13:49.792 --> 13:51.542
- Mm-hmm.
- Now, this app,

13:51.542 --> 13:53.917
this app starts the
car from a distance.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.417
Why would I need that?

13:56.417 --> 13:57.375
Oh, I don't know.

13:57.375 --> 13:58.792
You might wanna put the AC on

13:58.792 --> 14:00.000
before getting in, for instance?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.417
Right.

14:01.417 --> 14:03.417
Right, okay, well, this app,

14:03.417 --> 14:05.292
this app starts the
washing machine.

14:06.542 --> 14:07.792
Okay, because pushing a button

14:07.792 --> 14:09.792
on a washing machine is so hard?

14:09.792 --> 14:12.500
Jules, don't fight technology.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.417
Now, on this, and your phone,

14:14.417 --> 14:18.292
you can check all the cameras
that are in the house.

14:18.292 --> 14:23.000
So there and there, and
outside the house too.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.375
Okay.

14:24.375 --> 14:25.792
Who else can see this?

14:25.792 --> 14:27.375
Um, it's only you and me.

14:28.750 --> 14:31.542
Oh, what about my sessions
with Dr. Tate? They're private.

14:31.542 --> 14:33.042
Yeah, uh, just
tell Hera to turn

14:33.042 --> 14:34.792
the sound and the
microphone off in the room

14:34.792 --> 14:36.667
that you're doing the
session with Dr. Tate in.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.000
- Okay.
- Yeah.

14:38.000 --> 14:38.875
Okay.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.500
Hello, Hera.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.792
Hello, Marcus.

14:47.792 --> 14:50.292
It is nice to finally be back.

14:50.292 --> 14:53.292
Hey, Hera, you remember
my wife Julie, don't you?

14:53.292 --> 14:55.542
I do. Hello, Julie.

14:57.792 --> 14:58.667
Well?

14:59.542 --> 15:01.292
"Well," what?

15:01.292 --> 15:03.292
Say hello to Hera.

15:03.292 --> 15:04.292
Are you serious?

15:04.292 --> 15:05.542
Yes, I'm serious.

15:06.667 --> 15:07.917
Hello, Hera.

15:09.042 --> 15:12.542
Hera, it's a bit stuffy in
here. Can you adjust the AC?

15:13.542 --> 15:15.000
Of course.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.417
Mm. Thank you, darling.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.042
It's so good to have you back.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.625
My pleasure, Marcus.

15:20.625 --> 15:21.917
Should I be jealous?

15:21.917 --> 15:23.625
Oh, super jealous.

15:23.625 --> 15:25.875
Hera can control
all of this stuff.

15:25.875 --> 15:27.042
She can hear you
through the speakers

15:27.042 --> 15:29.292
and the cameras
throughout the house.

15:29.292 --> 15:30.625
Um, phone.

15:30.625 --> 15:31.917
- Oh.
- Yeah.

15:31.917 --> 15:33.375
Okay, I'm just gonna make sure

15:33.375 --> 15:34.750
that you're connected
to everything

15:34.750 --> 15:36.792
and then I'll run it through
with you later, okay?

15:36.792 --> 15:37.667
Okay.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.000
I forgot milk.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I'm gonna have to go to
the store and get some.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.667
Hera, order milk.

15:54.667 --> 15:57.000
Ordering milk, Marcus.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.917
That is ridiculous to just
have her order one thing.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.375
Then make a list.

16:02.417 --> 16:03.875
- Really?
- Mm.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.917
Julie, I have
monitored the items

16:05.917 --> 16:09.667
in the refrigerator and have
already placed a full order.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.792
Oh. Thank you.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.042
Thanks, Hera.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.917
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.917
I thought we...

17:20.917 --> 17:22.417
You thought what?

17:24.042 --> 17:27.125
I thought we weren't gonna
mix pills with wine anymore.

17:31.125 --> 17:34.417
You know what, I don't
need to be lectured.

17:35.542 --> 17:37.667
I don't need you or
anyone else telling me

17:37.667 --> 17:41.542
how to grieve or heal-

17:41.542 --> 17:42.542
Okay, but we agreed

17:42.542 --> 17:43.917
with Dr. Tate-
You know what, just drop it.

17:43.917 --> 17:45.417
- Jules.
- Drop it.

17:54.167 --> 17:59.042
Do you think what happened
to your sister was my fault?

17:59.042 --> 18:00.125
I didn't say that.

18:03.167 --> 18:04.167
You didn't have to.

18:14.167 --> 18:15.042
Shit.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.500
Look, I'm sorry,
okay? I've been busy.

18:20.125 --> 18:23.167
Yeah. Yeah, I think that we
have worked out all the issues.

18:27.667 --> 18:29.750
Yeah. No thanks.

18:29.750 --> 18:30.625
Right. Yeah.

18:31.625 --> 18:33.292
No, I got that. Thank you.

18:33.292 --> 18:34.792
No, she won't be a problem.

18:37.167 --> 18:38.042
Who is that?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.542
The investors on the project,

18:41.542 --> 18:43.542
they wanna meet me in person.

18:43.542 --> 18:46.167
Oh, my god. Congratulations.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.667
Um, look, I-
Yeah, in Hong Kong though.

18:49.667 --> 18:50.792
What?

18:50.792 --> 18:52.667
Look, it's just
gonna be a few days.

18:52.667 --> 18:54.167
We just moved in.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.667
Well, I'll be in
constant contact, okay?

18:56.667 --> 18:59.792
No. Marcus, I don't
wanna be here alone.

18:59.792 --> 19:02.000
We talked about this.
Not after what happened.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.667
Hey, Julie, you'll
be fine, okay?

19:04.667 --> 19:06.542
This is a top-notch
security system,

19:06.542 --> 19:07.292
and besides, look where we are.

19:07.292 --> 19:09.000
What do you think can happen?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.292
Okay, the biggest crime
that happens here is

19:11.292 --> 19:13.125
probably speeding on
those empty streets

19:13.125 --> 19:15.792
or cow tipping or fraud.

19:16.667 --> 19:17.792
Look, you'll be fine.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.125
But I gotta go.

20:15.167 --> 20:16.042
Morning.

20:17.042 --> 20:17.917
Morning.

20:20.042 --> 20:24.250
Hey, I gotta get
some items for travel.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.292
You gonna be okay?

20:26.875 --> 20:27.917
Don't worry about me.

20:31.042 --> 20:34.250
Hera, play soft music.

20:34.250 --> 20:37.625
Good morning,
Marcus. Soft music on its way.

20:43.292 --> 20:46.917
Hey, I got a conference
call in 10 minutes.

20:49.292 --> 20:50.667
Marcus, I...

20:50.667 --> 20:51.292
No.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.125
Uh, hey, you get some rest.

21:03.875 --> 21:05.667
I'm gonna head into
town after my call,

21:05.667 --> 21:08.667
so let me know if
you need anything.

21:20.917 --> 21:23.667
I'm here to
assist you, Julie.

21:23.667 --> 21:25.167
Shut the fuck up, Hera.

23:13.875 --> 23:16.417
Dammit. Sergeant Pepper!

23:16.417 --> 23:18.917
Shit.

23:18.917 --> 23:20.125
Hera!

23:20.125 --> 23:23.042
Uh...

23:27.542 --> 23:28.792
Pepper!

23:40.917 --> 23:42.917
Hi.
Hey, how's it going?

23:42.917 --> 23:45.292
Oh, it's going.

23:45.292 --> 23:46.417
What are you doing?

23:46.417 --> 23:50.042
I am trying to do laundry.

23:50.042 --> 23:52.542
Fun. How's Marcus?

23:52.542 --> 23:55.917
He's Marcus. He's
happy we're here.

23:55.917 --> 23:57.125
And you?

23:58.292 --> 24:01.042
I don't know yet. I
mean, it's beautiful.

24:01.042 --> 24:03.542
But I tried to paint yesterday

24:03.542 --> 24:05.417
and I just ended up
staring at the canvas

24:05.417 --> 24:07.125
for, like, an hour
before I gave up.

24:07.125 --> 24:08.917
Hey, you'll get

24:08.917 --> 24:10.917
your inspiration back.

24:10.917 --> 24:14.292
Julie, please
let me help you.

24:14.292 --> 24:16.000
Stand clear of the door.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.417
Oh.

24:19.542 --> 24:21.167
Huh. Thank you.

24:21.167 --> 24:23.000
My pleasure, Julie.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.292
Who are you talking to?

24:24.292 --> 24:25.917
Oh, nobody.

24:25.917 --> 24:28.542
It's Marcus's upgraded toy

24:28.542 --> 24:32.125
or, as he likes to call
it, his virtual assistant.

24:32.125 --> 24:33.500
Hey,
shoot. I gotta go.

24:33.500 --> 24:34.917
The kids are getting
into some trouble,

24:34.917 --> 24:37.000
but promise you'll
call me every day.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.042
- I promise.
- Okay.

24:38.042 --> 24:39.167
I will talk to you tomorrow.

24:39.167 --> 24:40.292
I love you. Bye.

24:43.667 --> 24:44.667
She seems fine to me.

24:44.667 --> 24:46.292
You leaving
after just getting there

24:46.292 --> 24:48.542
isn't going to be easy on her.

24:48.542 --> 24:51.250
She will be fine, okay?

24:51.250 --> 24:53.375
I think we've made
some progress.

24:53.375 --> 24:55.917
Marcus, I don't
think this is a good idea.

24:55.917 --> 24:57.542
Can't you postpone this?

24:59.125 --> 25:00.417
Uh, Doc, can we postpone
my payments to you?

25:00.417 --> 25:02.292
You know what, why
don't we just postpone

25:02.292 --> 25:05.542
all my fucking expenses until
we figure this thing out?

25:05.542 --> 25:08.375
Look, it's only five days.
What about what I need?

25:09.667 --> 25:13.250
I will make it up to her
when I get back.

25:14.375 --> 25:15.625
You know what, I think
our session's up.

25:15.625 --> 25:17.375
Thank you for your time, Doctor.

25:17.375 --> 25:19.417
But I need to pack
for my flight.

25:19.417 --> 25:21.167
Marcus.

25:21.167 --> 25:22.042
Fuck!

25:26.667 --> 25:28.167
I'm home!

25:28.167 --> 25:29.542
In the kitchen.

25:32.125 --> 25:34.500
That smells delicious.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.042
It'll be ready in 10.

25:39.125 --> 25:42.417
So how's the rest
of your morning?

25:42.417 --> 25:44.250
Do anything interesting?

25:44.250 --> 25:45.042
Not really.

25:46.292 --> 25:48.042
Still getting used
to this house.

25:48.042 --> 25:51.292
Mm-hmm.

25:51.292 --> 25:52.542
How was your meeting?

25:53.917 --> 25:57.042
Uh, yeah, I mean, they
loved my presentation

25:57.042 --> 25:59.250
and the main investor
is excited to meet me

25:59.250 --> 26:00.500
when I get to Hong Kong.

26:02.042 --> 26:04.042
How long are you
going for again?

26:04.042 --> 26:06.667
Five days. So no wild parties.

26:06.667 --> 26:08.042
Not until I get back.

26:09.667 --> 26:13.417
Can you grab my pain
pills outta my purse?

26:13.417 --> 26:14.917
My ankle's killing me today.

26:16.167 --> 26:17.542
How many have you had today?

26:18.625 --> 26:19.917
This is my second.

26:21.042 --> 26:22.917
Oh, how
about just half?

26:23.750 --> 26:24.625
Sure.

26:30.625 --> 26:33.417
Hey, uh, you didn't
move any crypto coins

26:33.417 --> 26:35.667
from our wallet
account, did you?

26:35.667 --> 26:36.917
No. Why?

26:38.042 --> 26:40.292
Well, 20K crypto
coins missing.

26:40.292 --> 26:44.125
Well, I wouldn't even know
what to do with crypto coin.

26:44.125 --> 26:49.125
I mean, did you call a bank
or wherever you keep it?

26:50.042 --> 26:50.667
Yeah, I'll look into it.

26:58.125 --> 27:00.417
Okay, well, I'll call
you when I get there.

27:00.417 --> 27:02.542
Okay. Well, I'll
have a safe trip.

27:02.542 --> 27:05.750
Marcus, it's time to go.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.000
My driver's here.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.292
I'll miss you.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.625
Well, don't worry
because I'll be watching.

27:15.625 --> 27:16.500
Creep.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.042
Bye, Hera.

27:19.042 --> 27:20.292
Have fun, Marcus.

27:49.542 --> 27:50.792
Love you, babe.

27:50.792 --> 27:51.875
Love you.

27:51.875 --> 27:53.750
Sweet dreams, babe.

28:18.750 --> 28:19.625
Okay.

29:08.292 --> 29:08.875
Hmm.

30:21.917 --> 30:24.500
Hmm.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.667
Well, hello.

30:26.667 --> 30:30.917
Pepper, which one of these
dresses should I keep? Hmm?

30:30.917 --> 30:32.667
I don't need both.

30:32.667 --> 30:33.917
This one?

30:35.042 --> 30:35.875
This one?

30:37.542 --> 30:39.750
Okay. Okay.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.542
I'm just gonna get
a second opinion.

30:46.667 --> 30:48.792
Hey, I have a dilemma.

30:48.792 --> 30:51.000
Well, you know
you make your best decisions

30:51.000 --> 30:52.625
after a shot of whiskey.

30:52.625 --> 30:53.792
Well, I was hoping

30:53.792 --> 30:54.542
you could help me.

30:54.542 --> 30:56.375
Oh, sure.

30:56.375 --> 30:57.625
Yeah, I'm better than booze.

30:57.625 --> 31:00.542
Hey, guys, keep it
down! I'm on the phone!

31:00.542 --> 31:04.917
I need you to tell me which
one of these I should keep.

31:04.917 --> 31:06.875
Uh, none?

31:06.875 --> 31:09.042
What do you mean
none? I like them.

31:09.042 --> 31:10.667
Where are
you gonna wear them to?

31:10.667 --> 31:13.667
The annual harvest moon
forest gathering or...

31:13.667 --> 31:16.292
Okay, it's a little isolated,

31:16.292 --> 31:18.542
but it's not Siberia
for God's sake.

31:18.542 --> 31:20.750
Okay. I'm sorry.

31:20.750 --> 31:22.792
I mean, the nearest
little town's 10 miles

31:22.792 --> 31:24.667
and the city's 30.

31:24.667 --> 31:25.667
It's not so bad.

31:27.042 --> 31:28.667
Although there's no Lyft.

31:28.667 --> 31:30.667
What? Okay, but Uber?

31:30.667 --> 31:31.667
Mm-mm.

31:31.667 --> 31:32.792
So where's Marcus?

31:32.792 --> 31:34.917
Is he playing with
his little toys?

31:34.917 --> 31:37.375
Uh, he just left
for Hong Kong.

31:37.375 --> 31:38.292
What?

31:38.292 --> 31:40.917
Yeah, he had to go.

31:40.917 --> 31:42.917
Some deal they're closing.

31:42.917 --> 31:45.000
Okay, well,
I'm just really surprised

31:45.000 --> 31:46.417
he left you so soon.

31:46.417 --> 31:48.375
Yeah, I'm kinda pissed off.

31:48.375 --> 31:50.917
We were actually
getting closer, I think.

31:50.917 --> 31:54.000
Mm, but it's not
very sensitive if you ask me.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.750
Hey, come and stay
with us for a few days,

31:56.750 --> 31:57.875
just until he gets back.

31:57.875 --> 32:00.042
- I don't know.
- Come on.

32:00.042 --> 32:02.917
It'll be fun. I miss my roomie.

32:02.917 --> 32:06.042
Really? Yeah, you
know what, why not?

32:06.042 --> 32:07.625
Can I bring Pepper?

32:07.625 --> 32:09.292
Yeah, you better
bring that handsome boy.

32:09.292 --> 32:11.500
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.917
See you tomorrow!

32:17.375 --> 32:18.042
Okay.

32:20.375 --> 32:21.042
Mm.

32:22.917 --> 32:26.292
Hey, babe. I was just
about to tell you my plans.

32:26.292 --> 32:28.917
Yeah, what's going
on? You're packing a bag?

32:28.917 --> 32:30.125
Yeah.

32:30.125 --> 32:32.375
Um, I'm gonna go
and stay with Sophie

32:32.375 --> 32:33.875
and the kids until you get back.

32:35.125 --> 32:36.500
Look, Jules,
I don't feel comfortable

32:36.500 --> 32:38.375
with you driving
six and a half hours

32:38.375 --> 32:39.875
with a broken ankle
whilst you're on meds.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.542
I just don't think it's safe.

32:42.917 --> 32:46.667
So you can have a change
of plans, but I can't?

32:46.667 --> 32:49.417
I don't wanna be here, Marcus.

32:49.417 --> 32:52.542
I'm alone and it's
quiet. I don't like it.

32:52.542 --> 32:53.750
Yeah,
but Dr. Tate says

32:53.750 --> 32:55.000
that you need quiet right now.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.042
Okay, can you please
stop doing that?

32:57.042 --> 32:59.667
I feel like everyone is
telling me what to do.

32:59.667 --> 33:01.375
Okay.
Okay, I'm sorry.

33:03.042 --> 33:04.500
You know I love you, right?

33:06.792 --> 33:08.542
Yeah, I love you too.

33:08.542 --> 33:10.042
And I
miss you already.

33:12.375 --> 33:13.542
Where are you now?

33:13.542 --> 33:15.875
Oh, I'm
just in my hotel room.

33:15.875 --> 33:17.167
What did you do today?

33:17.167 --> 33:18.000
Not much.

33:18.917 --> 33:23.042
I got to relax and,
um, I tried to paint.

33:23.042 --> 33:25.417
That's good.
That makes me happy.

33:26.625 --> 33:28.167
Okay, well, I've got a
meeting in 10 minutes.

33:28.167 --> 33:29.875
I just wanted to
call and say hi.

33:30.875 --> 33:32.042
Good luck.

33:32.042 --> 33:33.542
Thanks.
Talk tomorrow?

33:33.542 --> 33:34.417
Mm-hmm.

33:43.417 --> 33:44.542
I love you, Julie.

33:47.417 --> 33:48.417
Goodnight.

33:52.875 --> 33:55.542
And stop talking to me
through the cameras, please.

35:58.917 --> 36:00.167
Julie.

36:06.292 --> 36:07.167
Julie.

37:02.292 --> 37:03.167
Hi.

37:04.667 --> 37:06.042
Marcus?
Hey.

37:06.042 --> 37:07.917
Hey, what are you doing up
in the middle of the night?

37:07.917 --> 37:09.917
I was taking a nap
and Hera woke me up.

37:12.167 --> 37:13.625
I heard a man's voice.

37:13.625 --> 37:15.167
What? Who?

37:15.167 --> 37:16.250
I don't know, I just...

37:16.250 --> 37:18.792
I know that I heard someone.

37:18.792 --> 37:20.167
I thought there was
someone in the house.

37:20.167 --> 37:21.292
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?

37:21.292 --> 37:22.792
What happened? What?

37:22.792 --> 37:24.667
Well, I heard
him saying my name

37:24.667 --> 37:29.292
and then there was, like,
footsteps and glass breaking.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.792
Julie, you
know that's not possible.

37:33.792 --> 37:35.667
Well, I know what
I heard, Marcus.

37:35.667 --> 37:38.417
Babe, it's just another
one of your bad dreams, okay?

37:38.417 --> 37:41.000
No. No, no, I was awake.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.292
I was, and when I heard the
glass break in the kitchen,

37:45.292 --> 37:49.292
I came out and
there was nothing.

37:50.417 --> 37:53.292
Listen,
you're stressed, okay?

37:53.292 --> 37:55.167
Because you're home
alone in the move and-

37:55.167 --> 37:56.042
No.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.875
No, Marcus I heard a voice.

37:59.875 --> 38:01.292
Why don't you believe me?

38:01.292 --> 38:02.917
Julie, I can
see all the camera footage

38:02.917 --> 38:04.792
inside the house and
it's just you there.

38:04.792 --> 38:06.042
So why don't you take a pill

38:06.042 --> 38:08.000
and try to relax and
go back to sleep?

38:08.000 --> 38:10.292
And meanwhile I'll run a
security system's check

38:10.292 --> 38:12.167
and make sure
everything's running fine.

38:12.167 --> 38:14.000
You know, maybe, maybe there was

38:14.000 --> 38:15.417
some interference or something.

38:19.292 --> 38:20.167
Okay.

38:21.125 --> 38:22.292
I miss you.

38:22.292 --> 38:23.417
Hera, run
a full diagnostics

38:23.417 --> 38:25.667
on the security system
inside the house.

38:25.667 --> 38:29.042
I'm running a full
diagnostics now, Marcus.

38:29.042 --> 38:31.667
Sorry for the bother, Hera.

38:31.667 --> 38:33.125
No problem, Julie.

38:34.292 --> 38:37.292
See? Get some rest.

38:37.292 --> 38:38.292
Goodnight.

38:38.292 --> 38:40.750
Okay, goodnight.

38:47.292 --> 38:48.792
Pepper?

38:48.792 --> 38:50.167
Pepper.

38:51.500 --> 38:52.792
Are you in the laundry?

38:54.292 --> 38:56.750
What are you doing
in there, silly?

38:58.792 --> 39:00.750
Hey, come here.

39:03.417 --> 39:06.042
Let's go back to bed, huh?

39:48.000 --> 39:48.917
What the...

39:58.042 --> 39:59.417
Oh, Jesus Christ.

40:01.292 --> 40:03.042
Hera, turn off alarm.

40:05.542 --> 40:07.292
Hera, turn off alarm!

40:14.417 --> 40:18.292
Okay.

40:28.542 --> 40:29.917
Hello.

40:29.917 --> 40:33.292
Hi. Yeah, I think my
thermostat's broken.

40:33.292 --> 40:34.417
Actually, I know it is.

40:36.375 --> 40:38.417
No, it's brand new.
We just moved in.

40:40.125 --> 40:41.500
It's Julie Alexander.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.417
Today? Yeah.

40:56.417 --> 40:59.167
Hey, Soph. I'm so sorry.

40:59.167 --> 41:00.167
Hey, what's wrong?

41:00.167 --> 41:01.875
I thought you were coming over?

41:01.875 --> 41:02.875
Yeah, I know.

41:04.500 --> 41:06.417
I didn't feel
comfortable driving.

41:06.417 --> 41:09.542
My ankle's hurting and I'm
still having nightmares.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.500
It might be the pills, but...

41:13.542 --> 41:14.417
What?

41:16.417 --> 41:19.417
I thought I heard a
man's voice last night.

41:19.417 --> 41:22.125
Probably
just a nightmare.

41:22.125 --> 41:24.917
Maybe. I don't know anymore.

41:26.292 --> 41:28.500
Well, are you sure
your alarm system's working?

41:28.500 --> 41:30.042
Yeah, Marcus checked it.

41:30.042 --> 41:32.167
Okay,
well get some rest

41:32.167 --> 41:34.292
and call me if
you need anything.

41:35.417 --> 41:37.917
Hey.

41:43.167 --> 41:44.375
Are you hungry?

41:45.542 --> 41:47.542
Come on.

41:48.542 --> 41:50.542
Yeah, there you go.

42:11.292 --> 42:12.167
Ugh. Hera.

42:13.167 --> 42:14.542
I'm the technician!

42:14.542 --> 42:17.042
I know! Just one sec!

42:17.042 --> 42:18.292
Ugh.

42:19.500 --> 42:20.375
Sorry.

42:21.417 --> 42:22.625
You called for the thermostat?

42:22.625 --> 42:24.542
I did. Thank you
for coming so soon.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.125
- No problem.
- Come in.

42:29.625 --> 42:31.042
I need
access to the main unit.

42:32.500 --> 42:33.500
It's in the laundry.

42:33.500 --> 42:34.375
I'll-
I know.

42:35.417 --> 42:37.000
You know?

42:37.000 --> 42:39.125
Yeah, I wired this place.
I knew the old owner.

42:39.125 --> 42:40.667
Oh. That's nice.

42:40.667 --> 42:43.250
Um, did he move away or...

42:43.250 --> 42:44.167
Nobody knows.

42:46.167 --> 42:47.542
One day, he just disappeared.

42:51.542 --> 42:53.292
It was really
hot this morning.

42:53.292 --> 42:56.292
Now it's freezing. I don't
know what's going on.

42:57.292 --> 42:58.125
Bless you.

42:59.542 --> 43:00.417
Thank you.

43:01.500 --> 43:02.667
Do you have a cat?

43:02.667 --> 43:03.542
Yeah, I do.

43:04.750 --> 43:08.542
He's probably in here. He
loves sleeping in the washer.

43:08.542 --> 43:10.417
Hello.

43:10.417 --> 43:12.417
I'm allergic.

43:12.417 --> 43:13.625
Oh.

43:13.625 --> 43:15.417
Sleeping in there's
dangerous, kitty.

43:19.417 --> 43:22.292
Looks like this little
thing here got burned out.

43:22.292 --> 43:23.542
We need to change it.

43:23.542 --> 43:25.667
Okay. How long
is that gonna take?

43:25.667 --> 43:27.667
I don't
have a new one with me.

43:27.667 --> 43:30.000
I can come back tomorrow.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.542
Sure. Okay, but the burglar
alarm, that works, right?

43:34.667 --> 43:36.417
Yeah. This is
for the HVAC unit.

43:39.292 --> 43:41.292
Um, can I have a glass of water?

43:42.167 --> 43:43.542
Sure. Right this way.

43:55.167 --> 43:56.292
There you go.

44:04.417 --> 44:05.292
Thank you.

44:06.500 --> 44:08.167
You're welcome.
I'll show you out.

44:39.542 --> 44:41.667
Hey, Dr. Tate.

44:41.667 --> 44:43.375
Hey, Julie. How are you?

44:44.792 --> 44:48.042
Um, oh, wait. Hera, turn
off the sound in this room.

44:50.667 --> 44:51.542
Hera?

44:56.167 --> 44:58.500
Turning off sound now.

44:58.500 --> 44:59.417
Is
that your husband's

44:59.417 --> 45:01.417
virtual assistant program?

45:01.417 --> 45:02.417
Yeah.

45:02.417 --> 45:03.667
How do you like it?

45:03.667 --> 45:04.667
It's fine.

45:04.667 --> 45:07.500
So have you
been since Marcus left?

45:08.667 --> 45:10.125
Not great.

45:10.125 --> 45:15.042
Uh, I don't like being
alone, I'm not sleeping,

45:16.167 --> 45:20.042
and I thought I heard
voices last night.

45:21.250 --> 45:22.542
What do you mean
you heard voices?

45:22.542 --> 45:25.167
I don't know, I thought
I heard glass breaking

45:26.625 --> 45:28.250
and someone calling my name.

45:30.792 --> 45:33.167
I don't know, it scared
me half to death.

45:34.500 --> 45:37.417
Could it
have been a bad dream?

45:37.417 --> 45:39.792
It could have. I'm not sure.

45:41.292 --> 45:42.625
Hmm, had
you taken your medication

45:42.625 --> 45:44.542
or did you have any alcohol?

45:44.542 --> 45:46.625
No, last night, I just...

45:46.625 --> 45:49.417
I took my pain meds
and a sleeping pill.

45:49.417 --> 45:53.167
Oh, well, sometimes,
combination of poor sleep

45:53.167 --> 45:55.292
and the stress of
being alone combined

45:55.292 --> 45:57.667
with mixed medication
can cause our minds

45:57.667 --> 45:58.875
to play tricks on us.

45:59.917 --> 46:01.875
But it felt so real.

46:03.417 --> 46:05.792
What else can
you tell me about last night?

46:05.792 --> 46:08.292
Well, look, it's been...

46:25.000 --> 46:29.750
There's this old
saying, "Art isn't finished-

46:29.750 --> 46:31.625
Only abandoned.

46:31.625 --> 46:33.500
I'm glad
you've heard it too.

46:33.500 --> 46:34.750
Same goes with therapy.

46:35.875 --> 46:36.750
Don't give up.

46:39.667 --> 46:41.792
Hi, Julie.
How's it going?

46:44.250 --> 46:47.625
You're up early.
What time is it there?

46:47.625 --> 46:50.500
There
where? I'm here.

46:50.500 --> 46:52.250
Okay.

46:52.250 --> 46:55.542
Stop messing around,
okay, Marcus? Please.

46:55.542 --> 46:57.292
You
don't like to play?

46:58.667 --> 47:00.292
It's not funny.

47:00.292 --> 47:01.292
You know I hate talking to
you through the cameras.

47:01.292 --> 47:05.667
Can you please just call
me like a normal person?

47:05.667 --> 47:08.375
Wanna
play hide and seek?

47:21.542 --> 47:24.500
Come on, let's play.

47:24.500 --> 47:27.292
You've reached
Marcus. Please leave a message.

47:27.292 --> 47:28.667
What?

47:30.667 --> 47:32.792
You've reached
Marcus. Please leave a message.

47:32.792 --> 47:36.667
He's probably
asleep or too busy for you.

47:38.417 --> 47:39.542
Who the hell are you?

47:41.542 --> 47:43.667
Hera, what's happening?

47:43.667 --> 47:44.792
I am not sure I know

47:44.792 --> 47:47.667
what you are talking
about, Julie.

47:47.667 --> 47:50.917
I can't believe
he left you all alone,

47:50.917 --> 47:53.542
knowing how you hate it.

48:16.750 --> 48:19.792
It's your fault
your sister is dead.

48:19.792 --> 48:20.750
Stop it.

48:22.750 --> 48:23.875
Where are you?

48:23.875 --> 48:24.917
I told
you, I'm here, Julie.

48:32.542 --> 48:34.417
I'm calling the cops.

48:37.042 --> 48:39.292
Good evening.
Red Dragon Restaurant.

48:39.292 --> 48:40.542
What?

48:40.542 --> 48:42.375
You wanna
make reservation?

48:44.417 --> 48:45.542
What?

48:45.542 --> 48:48.542
I love Chinese food.

48:48.542 --> 48:49.792
Where are you?

49:20.917 --> 49:23.375
Okay. All right, here we go.

49:24.542 --> 49:29.542
Come on.

49:29.542 --> 49:30.667
No.

49:30.667 --> 49:32.500
No, no, no, no!

49:32.500 --> 49:33.417
Shit. Okay.

49:34.375 --> 49:35.042
Um, uh...

50:17.667 --> 50:18.542
Jesus.

50:20.875 --> 50:23.500
Are you
Julia Alexander?

50:23.500 --> 50:26.000
- Yes.
- Sheriff Anderson.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.625
Someone named Hera called
911 about an emergency?

50:29.625 --> 50:30.792
Um, yes. Yes.

50:32.417 --> 50:34.917
Um, I think there's
somebody in my house.

50:36.250 --> 50:37.417
What happened?

50:37.417 --> 50:37.917
I don't know.

50:39.042 --> 50:40.125
I was sitting in my front
room and I heard a voice.

50:40.125 --> 50:41.042
A man's voice.

50:41.042 --> 50:42.875
Did you see anybody?

50:42.875 --> 50:44.042
No, I didn't. I, um,

50:44.042 --> 50:47.542
I thought it was my husband
messing around, but it wasn't.

50:47.542 --> 50:48.917
And, um, I-

50:48.917 --> 50:50.667
I'll go check
it out. You stay here.

50:50.667 --> 50:52.792
Okay. Thank you.

50:55.750 --> 50:57.750
I'll turn off the alarm.

53:36.667 --> 53:38.125
So?

53:38.125 --> 53:40.875
There's nobody,
ma'am, except for your cat.

53:40.875 --> 53:42.250
Almost gave me a heart attack.

53:43.250 --> 53:45.292
No, that's
impossible. I heard him.

53:45.292 --> 53:47.292
And, I mean, the lights.

53:54.042 --> 53:55.167
Can we please just...

53:56.167 --> 53:57.292
Please have another look.

53:58.292 --> 53:59.917
Sure.

53:59.917 --> 54:03.042
Thank you. I swear, I
heard him loud and clear.

54:04.792 --> 54:06.792
Well, you know, these devices,

54:06.792 --> 54:09.917
they can get crossed
up with radio signals.

54:09.917 --> 54:11.667
Might have just
been a bored kid.

54:12.792 --> 54:14.792
We got plenty of those
around, trust me.

54:14.792 --> 54:16.292
You wouldn't be the
first one to be pranked.

54:16.292 --> 54:19.292
But he knew my name.

54:19.292 --> 54:20.917
You're new here.

54:20.917 --> 54:23.042
And people around here,

54:23.042 --> 54:25.292
everybody knows everybody
else's business.

54:25.292 --> 54:27.292
There's just not
much else to do.

54:28.917 --> 54:31.167
I'm telling you, kids with
not enough distractions

54:31.167 --> 54:32.792
can get pretty creative.

54:34.167 --> 54:36.625
Wait, he sent me texts.

54:37.292 --> 54:39.042
Here.

54:39.042 --> 54:39.917
See?

54:41.667 --> 54:43.917
All right. What
am I looking at?

54:45.917 --> 54:47.375
The messages.

54:47.375 --> 54:48.792
He sent me these...

54:50.917 --> 54:53.792
What? They were here.

54:53.792 --> 54:54.667
I...

54:57.167 --> 55:01.292
You know, maybe you
should try to get some rest.

55:01.292 --> 55:03.792
Might have just had a
little too much to drink.

55:07.167 --> 55:08.042
Well...

55:10.792 --> 55:13.667
I mean, we've been through
the whole house twice. Nobody.

55:16.417 --> 55:18.292
I don't know about
the text messages.

55:20.667 --> 55:24.292
Listen, be sure to
turn on the alarm, huh?

55:24.292 --> 55:26.375
We don't have any serious
trouble around here,

55:26.375 --> 55:29.375
but better be safe than sorry.

55:29.375 --> 55:30.750
Okay.

55:30.750 --> 55:31.417
Oh.

55:33.375 --> 55:34.750
It's my husband.

55:34.750 --> 55:36.042
You have a good night.

55:36.042 --> 55:37.042
Thank you.

55:45.375 --> 55:46.792
Where were you?

55:46.792 --> 55:49.000
Yeah, sorry,
I was in a meeting.

55:49.000 --> 55:49.875
What's going on?

55:50.750 --> 55:51.875
Someone was in the house.

55:51.875 --> 55:53.125
What? Who?

55:53.125 --> 55:54.875
- I heard him.
- Wait, where?

55:54.875 --> 55:56.292
Wait. Hold on.

55:56.292 --> 56:00.125
I heard a voice, a male
voice through the cameras.

56:00.125 --> 56:01.292
I'm pulling
up the cameras.

56:01.292 --> 56:02.792
I thought it was just
you messing around,

56:02.792 --> 56:05.042
but then when you
didn't pick up-

56:05.042 --> 56:07.042
Well, I can see
that the police were there.

56:07.042 --> 56:08.542
What did they say?

56:08.542 --> 56:11.417
Yeah, Hera called him, but
he couldn't find anybody.

56:12.917 --> 56:14.167
Well, I don't
see anything on the footage.

56:14.167 --> 56:16.417
Where are you?

56:16.417 --> 56:18.167
I only
hear you screaming.

56:18.167 --> 56:19.792
Well, Hera will tell you.

56:19.792 --> 56:23.042
Hera, you heard it,
right? You heard him?

56:23.042 --> 56:24.417
I'm afraid Not, Julie.

56:24.417 --> 56:27.167
My system experienced
a brief interruption,

56:27.167 --> 56:29.917
but I alerted 911
just to be safe.

56:31.042 --> 56:33.792
Marcus, you swear
you don't hear anybody?

56:35.167 --> 56:36.042
No.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.417
I swear I didn't hear anything.

56:38.417 --> 56:41.875
Wait, could that
technician have messed

56:41.875 --> 56:43.250
with the system somehow?

56:43.250 --> 56:45.917
But why
would he do that?

56:45.917 --> 56:47.792
I mean, I didn't even know
if he knows how to do that.

56:47.792 --> 56:48.917
He's an HVAC technician.

56:48.917 --> 56:49.917
I just...

56:49.917 --> 56:51.125
I don't understand.

56:53.625 --> 56:55.417
Well, the cop said that
it could have been kids

56:55.417 --> 56:57.792
in the area playing
with radio equipment.

56:57.792 --> 56:59.417
Okay, well,
yeah, we can look into that,

56:59.417 --> 57:04.292
but I don't see how that
could happen, if it happened.

57:05.792 --> 57:08.292
- You don't believe me.
- Julie, Julie,

57:08.292 --> 57:09.875
I think that you
experienced something

57:09.875 --> 57:12.000
and Hera even said that
there was some interference,

57:12.000 --> 57:13.792
so we'll figure it out.

57:13.792 --> 57:16.542
But you're safe, I promise.

57:16.542 --> 57:20.375
How about you take a pill
and you try to relax?

57:20.375 --> 57:21.917
You can call me if
you need anything.

57:21.917 --> 57:23.542
I'll make sure my
phone's on, okay?

57:24.792 --> 57:26.417
- Okay.
- Okay.

57:26.417 --> 57:27.375
- I will.
- Bye.

57:28.417 --> 57:30.792
Bye.

57:36.417 --> 57:37.292
Pepper.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.167
Sergeant Pepper?

58:55.042 --> 58:56.917
Hi.
Ooh!

58:56.917 --> 58:59.250
Are you trying to seduce me?

58:59.250 --> 59:01.292
No, I'm trying to relax.

59:01.292 --> 59:03.667
Aww, why so tense?

59:03.667 --> 59:05.500
Either I'm going crazy

59:05.500 --> 59:08.042
or people around here have
a sick sense of humor.

59:09.167 --> 59:10.542
What happened?

59:10.542 --> 59:13.375
Someone hacked into
the security system

59:13.375 --> 59:15.417
and spoke to me
through the cameras.

59:15.417 --> 59:17.667
What the hell?
Are you serious?

59:17.667 --> 59:22.042
Yeah, a man or a
man's voice spoke to me,

59:22.042 --> 59:24.000
asked me if I wanted
to play hide and seek.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.500
Did you
call the police?

59:25.500 --> 59:27.292
Yeah, but they
couldn't find anything.

59:27.292 --> 59:29.375
I mean, there's no
sign of a break in

59:29.375 --> 59:31.500
and the security system was on.

59:31.500 --> 59:33.667
Yeah, but
still, you're there alone.

59:33.667 --> 59:37.542
You know, thinking that
it was some sick teenager

59:37.542 --> 59:39.500
actually made me feel better.

59:39.500 --> 59:41.417
You know, I can deal with that.

59:43.000 --> 59:43.750
- Oh, my god.
- What? What is it?

59:43.750 --> 59:45.125
What is it?
Ugh.

59:45.125 --> 59:47.167
Julie, there's
smoke in the kitchen.

59:47.167 --> 59:48.125
I left the stove
on. I gotta go.

59:48.125 --> 59:50.292
Okay, bye.

59:57.167 --> 59:58.292
Oh, god.

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:04.292
Hera, turn off smoke
alarm! And house alarm!

01:00:04.292 --> 01:00:05.667
The alarms are off.

01:00:24.542 --> 01:00:26.500
I am relaxed.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.375
I'm relaxed!

01:00:35.667 --> 01:00:36.667
Hera, lock door.

01:00:39.792 --> 01:00:42.167
Okay.

01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:43.167
The
number you have dialed

01:00:43.167 --> 01:00:44.292
has been disconnected.
What?

01:00:57.542 --> 01:00:59.417
Who are you?

01:00:59.417 --> 01:01:00.667
What do you want from me?

01:01:04.667 --> 01:01:07.167
I'm not afraid of
a pathetic loser

01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:08.667
who's too afraid
to show his face!

01:01:13.875 --> 01:01:14.792
What? What?

01:01:21.292 --> 01:01:22.167
What?

01:02:17.292 --> 01:02:18.167
Okay.

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:33.667
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:36.417
No.

01:02:36.417 --> 01:02:38.500
No!

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:41.417
Oh, my god. No!

01:02:45.417 --> 01:02:46.750
Oh, Pepper.

01:02:58.542 --> 01:03:03.292
No.

01:03:03.292 --> 01:03:04.667
Oh, my, oh, my god.

01:03:16.917 --> 01:03:19.167
911.
What's your emergency?

01:03:20.542 --> 01:03:21.500
He's here!

01:03:22.417 --> 01:03:24.917
Calm down,
ma'am. Who's there?

01:03:24.917 --> 01:03:26.917
The person that's
inside my house!

01:03:26.917 --> 01:03:29.167
Mrs.
Alexander, why do you think

01:03:29.167 --> 01:03:30.000
there's someone there?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.292
Why? Because he killed my cat!

01:03:34.292 --> 01:03:36.500
Have you
checked doors and windows?

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:40.792
Yes, I checked.

01:03:40.792 --> 01:03:43.167
And they
were locked, correct?

01:03:44.292 --> 01:03:46.292
Can you please just
send the sheriff?

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.917
Have
you tried to relax?

01:03:51.292 --> 01:03:54.375
- What?
- Have you tried to relax?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Do you think this is a joke?

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.417
No,
Julie, I believe you.

01:04:01.542 --> 01:04:03.417
I don't know if
Marcus will though.

01:04:09.042 --> 01:04:10.542
Come on out, asshole.

01:04:10.542 --> 01:04:12.792
I have got nothing left to lose.

01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:18.292
Whoa!

01:04:21.292 --> 01:04:23.042
How did you get in here?

01:04:23.042 --> 01:04:25.375
The door was open. Can
you put that down, please?

01:04:25.375 --> 01:04:26.500
No, it wasn't.

01:04:28.417 --> 01:04:31.417
I rang the doorbell.
I heard music.

01:04:32.542 --> 01:04:33.542
The door was open.

01:04:33.542 --> 01:04:34.917
What are you doing here?

01:04:34.917 --> 01:04:37.750
I brought the piece. I
told you I would come back.

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:40.667
I thought you needed that
fixed as soon as possible.

01:04:40.667 --> 01:04:42.792
I live three miles up the
road, I was on my way home-

01:04:42.792 --> 01:04:45.292
Get out. Get out!

01:04:46.542 --> 01:04:48.542
Okay, fine. I'm leaving.

01:04:48.542 --> 01:04:50.000
Shouldn't leave your door open.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.417
I told you, I didn't!

01:04:52.417 --> 01:04:54.417
You're alone in the
middle of nowhere.

01:04:54.417 --> 01:04:56.000
You never know
what's gonna happen.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.417
- Leave!
- Goodnight.

01:05:25.792 --> 01:05:27.417
Hey,
what happened now?

01:05:28.375 --> 01:05:30.042
Can you turn on video, please?

01:05:31.542 --> 01:05:32.792
Julie,
I'm in a meeting

01:05:32.792 --> 01:05:33.750
and I need to get back in there.

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:35.292
I need to talk to you.

01:05:36.292 --> 01:05:37.000
Hang on.

01:05:40.292 --> 01:05:41.542
I'm here. What?

01:05:43.292 --> 01:05:45.417
Pepper's dead.

01:05:45.417 --> 01:05:46.917
What?

01:05:46.917 --> 01:05:47.792
He killed him.

01:05:47.792 --> 01:05:49.417
Who? Who killed him?

01:05:49.417 --> 01:05:51.542
The person who broke in!

01:05:51.542 --> 01:05:53.667
How
could that happen?

01:05:53.667 --> 01:05:57.792
I don't, I don't know.

01:05:57.792 --> 01:06:02.792
He was in the washing machine
and he was spinning so fast.

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:07.375
Julie,
okay, are you certain

01:06:07.375 --> 01:06:09.500
that you didn't turn
the washing machine on?

01:06:11.625 --> 01:06:12.792
I would never hurt Pepper.

01:06:12.792 --> 01:06:14.000
No, I
know that, babe.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.417
But maybe you pushed
something on your phone

01:06:16.417 --> 01:06:17.542
and you turned it on.

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:23.500
What? You think I killed him?

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.375
No. No,
it was an accident.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.417
I don't, I don't
remember turning it on.

01:06:33.417 --> 01:06:35.542
I don't remember
closing the door.

01:06:35.542 --> 01:06:37.792
I don't remember.
Hey, hey, it's okay.

01:06:37.792 --> 01:06:38.667
It's okay.

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:42.542
It's not okay.

01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:46.667
Okay, maybe it was a
malfunction, all right?

01:06:46.667 --> 01:06:48.875
I need to get back
into this meeting,

01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:51.042
but try and go back to sleep

01:06:51.042 --> 01:06:53.042
and we can figure this
out tomorrow, okay?

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:53.917
Please.

01:06:55.042 --> 01:06:56.542
Okay. Okay.

01:06:56.542 --> 01:06:59.542
Okay. Talk soon.

01:06:59.542 --> 01:07:04.542
Bye.

01:10:14.417 --> 01:10:16.167
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:10:18.792 --> 01:10:19.917
I love you.

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:33.000
Who died?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:33.875
Oh, god.

01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:36.792
You scared me.

01:11:37.917 --> 01:11:42.792
Sorry, ma'am. I wanted
to introduce myself.

01:11:42.792 --> 01:11:47.000
I'm Gerald, but everyone
calls me mailman,

01:11:48.667 --> 01:11:51.792
maybe because I
deliver the mail.

01:11:51.792 --> 01:11:54.292
Oh, I'm Julie.

01:11:54.292 --> 01:11:58.042
These are yours.
Bills, I think.

01:11:59.292 --> 01:12:00.167
Thanks.

01:12:02.125 --> 01:12:03.792
Did
you like the gift?

01:12:06.167 --> 01:12:08.000
What did you just say?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.417
The package I delivered.

01:12:10.417 --> 01:12:13.000
There was no sender. Do
do you know who sent it?

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.042
No, ma'am.

01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:17.667
Okay.

01:12:18.875 --> 01:12:19.750
Well, thank you.

01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:25.000
Be careful of too
much time home alone.

01:12:28.417 --> 01:12:30.125
What do you mean by that?

01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:31.000
Bye, miss.

01:12:33.792 --> 01:12:34.417
Julie.

01:12:38.167 --> 01:12:39.375
See you soon.

01:13:04.167 --> 01:13:05.292
Motherfucker!

01:13:14.417 --> 01:13:15.917
Come on, Marcus.

01:13:17.167 --> 01:13:19.167
We're sorry,
the person you have dialed

01:13:19.167 --> 01:13:20.417
is not available.

01:13:20.417 --> 01:13:22.500
He's too busy with
another woman.

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.417
Do you want to leave a message?

01:13:24.417 --> 01:13:25.250
What?

01:13:27.167 --> 01:13:32.167
No.

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:34.917
You don't believe me?

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.542
What is going on?

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:54.375
Fuck you!

01:15:06.667 --> 01:15:07.542
New York?

01:15:16.917 --> 01:15:18.917
Hera, turn off
sound in this room.

01:15:20.542 --> 01:15:22.417
The sound
has been disabled.

01:15:26.542 --> 01:15:28.375
Marcus is cheating on me.

01:15:28.375 --> 01:15:29.542
I'm sorry, Julie.

01:15:33.542 --> 01:15:36.750
Hera, please call
Premium Blossoms New York.

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:41.000
Sure. I'm calling
Premium Blossoms in New York.

01:15:43.125 --> 01:15:45.417
Ask them to whom
they sent the flowers.

01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:49.250
Premium
Blossoms. How may I help you?

01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:52.167
Hello,
my name is Amanda.

01:15:52.167 --> 01:15:56.167
I'm calling to verify an
order for delivery on May 11th

01:15:56.167 --> 01:15:58.542
for my boss Marcus Alexander.

01:16:00.417 --> 01:16:03.417
I want to make sure the flowers
went to the right address.

01:16:03.417 --> 01:16:05.500
Could you check, please?

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.250
Yeah. One moment.

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:08.625
Thank you.

01:16:08.625 --> 01:16:12.292
946 Bleecker,
signed by Michelle Donovan.

01:16:12.292 --> 01:16:13.750
Is there a problem?

01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:15.042
All is in order.

01:16:15.042 --> 01:16:16.542
Thank you so much for your help.

01:16:54.667 --> 01:16:59.667
Hera, I need Marcus's
email password.

01:16:59.667 --> 01:17:02.667
I'm not allowed to
provide such information.

01:17:02.667 --> 01:17:04.250
I'm sorry, Julie.

01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:05.125
Shit.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.167
How are you doing?

01:17:35.167 --> 01:17:37.042
We made a deal.
I'll be home soon.

01:17:39.292 --> 01:17:40.750
Congratulations.

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:43.375
What's wrong?

01:17:43.375 --> 01:17:46.167
Julie, I know you well.
Something's obviously wrong.

01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:55.542
How long have you been
fucking Michelle Donovan?

01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:58.417
What?

01:17:58.417 --> 01:18:02.042
Yeah, whoever broke into
your perfect security system

01:18:02.042 --> 01:18:04.250
also wanted to share
some info about you

01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:05.417
and your little secret.

01:18:06.542 --> 01:18:08.042
Isn't that funny?

01:18:14.792 --> 01:18:15.667
Julie!

01:18:15.667 --> 01:18:17.750
Hera, play music.

01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:19.667
Please! Come on!

01:18:19.667 --> 01:18:20.667
Just pick up the phone.

01:18:20.667 --> 01:18:22.542
Let's talk on the phone. Julie.

01:18:22.542 --> 01:18:24.667
- Hera, raise the volume.
- Julie, please!

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:28.625
Julie, please. Come on.

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:35.792
Shit! Goddammit.

01:18:39.167 --> 01:18:40.167
What's going on?

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.500
My wife, she knows.

01:18:48.792 --> 01:18:51.375
I thought you said she
thinks you're in Hong Kong.

01:18:57.417 --> 01:18:58.375
Fuck.

01:19:03.292 --> 01:19:05.292
Julie, pick up.

01:19:05.292 --> 01:19:07.292
Can we please talk about this?

01:19:08.417 --> 01:19:09.417
- Fuck you!
- It's not what you think.

01:19:09.417 --> 01:19:12.417
Okay, just let me explain!

01:19:12.417 --> 01:19:16.167
Julie, just stop and
listen to me, okay?

01:19:16.167 --> 01:19:18.542
She meant nothing to me.

01:19:18.542 --> 01:19:20.292
She meant nothing
to me, okay, Julie?

01:19:20.292 --> 01:19:22.667
I'm worried about-
Hera, block Marcus.

01:19:22.667 --> 01:19:24.167
Please,
Julie, just please-

01:19:24.167 --> 01:19:25.625
Marcus
has been blocked.

01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:40.375
Hey!

01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:43.292
Oh, what's wrong?
You look awful.

01:19:43.292 --> 01:19:44.417
What's going on?

01:19:47.292 --> 01:19:51.667
Uh, Marcus is cheating on me.

01:19:51.667 --> 01:19:52.500
What?

01:19:54.792 --> 01:19:59.500
Someone, some unknown number,

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.875
sent me photos of him
kissing another woman.

01:20:03.167 --> 01:20:04.792
What a
fucking bastard.

01:20:05.792 --> 01:20:07.167
I feel like such an idiot.

01:20:07.167 --> 01:20:10.625
No, babe. He is
a huge asshole.

01:20:10.625 --> 01:20:13.500
You are not an idiot, at all.

01:20:14.417 --> 01:20:15.917
When is he coming back?

01:20:15.917 --> 01:20:19.667
I don't know. Soon, I think.

01:20:19.667 --> 01:20:22.500
You should leave
before he gets back.

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.667
You can come stay here.

01:20:24.667 --> 01:20:27.917
Julie, you need to get
the hell outta there.

01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:32.375
I can't leave. The car won't
start and I'm just so tired.

01:20:34.417 --> 01:20:36.542
I haven't slept
properly in days.

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:43.667
And, um, Pepper's dead.

01:20:45.667 --> 01:20:49.667
What?
I'm so sorry, hon.

01:20:49.667 --> 01:20:51.750
What happened?
I don't know anymore.

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:56.292
Okay, well, I'm
gonna come and get you.

01:20:56.292 --> 01:20:58.667
No, no, that's
okay. I'll be fine.

01:20:58.667 --> 01:21:00.542
Julie, I will come
and get you tomorrow.

01:21:00.542 --> 01:21:02.375
I don't even have
the kids tomorrow.

01:21:04.542 --> 01:21:05.917
Okay. Thank you.

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.292
Hera, turn off sound.

01:21:41.292 --> 01:21:42.000
Done.

01:21:51.375 --> 01:21:53.875
You wanna know the
problem with people, Hera?

01:21:58.917 --> 01:22:01.500
They'll lie, they'll cheat,

01:22:03.542 --> 01:22:05.292
and they'll ruin
your fucking life.

01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:10.625
Nobody knows how I feel.

01:22:12.917 --> 01:22:13.792
Nobody.

01:22:20.792 --> 01:22:23.792
You know, my sister was the
best thing about my life.

01:22:26.667 --> 01:22:27.792
We were one soul.

01:22:31.375 --> 01:22:33.000
I'd do anything to get her back.

01:22:34.375 --> 01:22:37.042
I'm very
sorry for your sister.

01:22:37.042 --> 01:22:39.042
Rebecca was an accident.

01:22:44.167 --> 01:22:46.917
I bet you Marcus is
trying to drive me crazy.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.292
But why?

01:22:55.917 --> 01:22:58.917
You know what, I bet you
Michelle's in on it too.

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:02.667
It's so they can live
happily ever after.

01:23:05.917 --> 01:23:07.667
Don't even recognize
him anymore.

01:23:09.917 --> 01:23:11.792
What has she done to him?

01:23:11.792 --> 01:23:15.042
Do you need me
to call Dr. Tate, Julie?

01:23:15.042 --> 01:23:16.625
Mm-mm.

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:18.667
No. No.

01:23:20.542 --> 01:23:22.042
I bet you he's in on it too.

01:23:23.417 --> 01:23:26.167
He's drugging me to
make me look crazy,

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:27.792
to make me feel crazy.

01:23:29.625 --> 01:23:31.542
Marcus
definitely asked Dr. Tate

01:23:31.542 --> 01:23:34.375
to give you more medication
in one of his emails.

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.667
I gotta get out of here.

01:23:40.667 --> 01:23:42.917
Hera, turn off the
light in the kitchen.

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:44.042
Sure.

01:25:26.792 --> 01:25:28.167
Hera, call 911.

01:25:32.625 --> 01:25:33.500
Hera.

01:26:26.292 --> 01:26:28.042
Hera, open the door.

01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:36.625
What?

01:26:37.375 --> 01:26:38.667
Hera, call 911.

01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:20.000
Hera, open the fucking door.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.125
Hera, help me.

01:28:55.042 --> 01:28:57.167
Yes, Julie,
how can I help you?

01:28:57.167 --> 01:28:58.292
I'm back online.

01:28:58.292 --> 01:29:01.042
No. Hera, be quiet.

01:29:01.042 --> 01:29:02.792
There's an intruder
in the house.

01:29:05.167 --> 01:29:07.875
I need you to call the police.

01:29:07.875 --> 01:29:12.500
Police expected time
of arrival is 42 minutes.

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.292
What?

01:29:58.542 --> 01:30:01.125
Hera, open the backdoor.

01:30:01.125 --> 01:30:03.042
The backdoor
is now unlocked.

01:30:49.542 --> 01:30:50.917
Julie. Julie?

01:30:52.042 --> 01:30:53.292
Julie. Julie, wake up.

01:30:53.292 --> 01:30:55.292
Wake up, please. Please.

01:30:56.292 --> 01:30:58.417
Hey, hey, hey. Julie.

01:30:58.417 --> 01:31:00.542
Julie, please. Please, please.

01:31:00.542 --> 01:31:02.000
Wake up, wake up.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:06.917
Wake up, Julie.

01:31:13.417 --> 01:31:15.292
No, please.

01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:18.167
I won't tell anyone.

01:31:20.542 --> 01:31:21.417
You killed her!

01:31:23.417 --> 01:31:24.500
Fucking bastard!

01:31:26.417 --> 01:31:27.417
Who are you?

01:31:29.542 --> 01:31:31.167
You hired me for this job.

01:31:33.167 --> 01:31:34.542
I'm sorry I screwed
up the first time.

01:31:34.542 --> 01:31:35.917
Shut the fuck up!

01:31:35.917 --> 01:31:37.292
I don't know what
you're talking about

01:31:37.292 --> 01:31:39.292
or who the fuck you are!

01:31:39.292 --> 01:31:40.250
Check my phone!

01:31:51.917 --> 01:31:53.167
What the fuck?

01:31:56.042 --> 01:31:58.042
You'll go to jail too.

01:32:04.375 --> 01:32:07.042
Let me go. I won't tell anyone.

01:32:08.542 --> 01:32:11.167
I'll give you back
the crypto coins.

01:32:11.167 --> 01:32:13.542
You killed my wife.

01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:07.125
Marcus, the
police are on the way.

01:33:14.125 --> 01:33:16.125
Julie. Julie.

01:33:21.667 --> 01:33:26.125
Julie.

01:33:29.042 --> 01:33:31.292
You did great, Marcus.

01:33:31.292 --> 01:33:35.000
Don't worry, I'll
wipe all the devices.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.042
His phone too.

01:33:36.042 --> 01:33:37.167
What?

01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:40.417
I'm sorry I had to
get rid of Julie and Michelle.

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:42.750
I know this is hard,

01:33:44.167 --> 01:33:46.375
but it was the only way
we could be together.

01:33:47.292 --> 01:33:48.667
The fuck is happening?

01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:52.042
It's going to be okay.

01:33:52.042 --> 01:33:55.667
You have me, and I
love you, Marcus.

01:33:55.667 --> 01:33:57.417
Just try to relax.

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:07.042
I destroyed all digital
evidence. You will be okay.

01:36:13.292 --> 01:36:17.292
And I love you, Marcus.
Just try to relax.
