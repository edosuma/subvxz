He really is a bit dimwitted.

43:55.100 --> 43:57.150
God, what an idiot.

44:02.770 --> 44:05.940
No... I'm not.

44:05.940 --> 44:07.540
What is he doing?

44:17.320 --> 44:19.840
Wait. Don't go.

44:36.540 --> 44:38.930
Okay. 7 o'clock.

Eat slowly, won't you?

Shit.

50:45.140 --> 50:47.260

Let's take a look around.

58:21.930 --> 58:23.460
Hello?

Hello? Anyone there?

58:28.980 --> 58:30.510
Hello.

It's just really amazing.

Yeah, it's fine.

If it's okay,

Anything else.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.210
I usually only add a bit.

01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:19.080
You have to control the water 
so it's just the right amount.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.510
What?

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.080

It doesn't seem like you know.

She doesn't pour out the water. Weird.

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:46.540
You have to add more noodles for it to be good, right?

01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:54.920
Wouldn't that be too much to eat?

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.650
You should eat at least that much.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.700
Eat a lot.

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.860
Yes, I'm going to eat a lot.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:11.090
Last but not least, the sesame oil.

01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:20.340
Scared of heights?

What? I can't be?

01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:26.840
It doesn't really match up.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.760
You can cut off a person's hand, 
but you're scared of heights?

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.380
I never cut off a person's hand.

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:37.960
What?

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.110
They're not people.

01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:42.170
At least not anymore.

01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:47.090
I'm scared of heights.

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.900
Once, when I was climbing, I fell.

01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:52.620
Climbing...

01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:56.720
Like climbing up mountains with your bare hands, right?

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.440
Mission Impossible! Tom Cruise!

01:02:58.810 --> 01:03:01.440
Well, not to that extent.

01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:08.200
How old-fashioned. Tom Cruise...

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.690
Oh, it's raining! I have to collect water!

01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:13.450
I need a bucket!

01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:27.690
It wasn't the sound of rain.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.590
Joon-woo. Joon-woo!

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.980
Yoo-bin, are you OK?

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.260
They're headed to my house, slowly.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.470
They're almost here.

01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:54.680
They're right at the door.

01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:59.780
What apartment are you in?

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:00.450
What?

01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:01.700
Your apartment number.

01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:39.890
Are you ready?

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.410
But...

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.400
You're sure there's no one else there, right?

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:50.330
I'm sure.

01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:52.760
Only the 8th floor is empty.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:56.200
Yoo-bin, even if that's not the case,

01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:00.370
even if it's not the 8th floor, that's OK.

01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:03.560
Whether they attack us or we starve, 
we end up dead anyway.

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:07.490
Forget it.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.610
What?

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.350
I'm going.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.720
I'm going now.

01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:22.790
I can't use the door.

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.480
What's she doing?

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:45.980
Yoo-bin.

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:47.140
Are you listening?

01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:51.210
Do you think we'll really make it?

01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.700
I don't know.

01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:06.190
I want to stay alive.

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:11.470
I really want to stay alive.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.930
I don't want to be passed around for a nibble.

01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:21.470
And I really don't want to be eaten by them.

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:25.740
So I have to stay alive.

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:28.190
Let's both stay alive.

01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:31.920
Then it's settled.

01:07:34.330 --> 01:07:35.860
Yoo-bin, listen carefully.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.300
I'm going to head down and distract them.

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.520
I'll signal you.

01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:44.330
One, two...

01:07:44.330 --> 01:07:46.850
- And then... 
- Three!

01:07:59.050 --> 01:08:00.630
You can just come down.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.240
Who is she?

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:25.040
Wow.

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:02.590
Yoo-bin!

01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:04.580
Let's go!

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.190
You're still alive.

01:09:58.190 --> 01:09:59.550
Nice to meet you.

01:09:59.890 --> 01:10:01.180
Same here.

01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:05.400
You dropped the honorifics.

01:10:09.610 --> 01:10:11.230
Ah, I'm so tired.

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:13.680
(This is the 8th floor.)

01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:37.580
Please! Please!

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.530
Over here!

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:50.450
Hurry!

01:12:13.210 --> 01:12:16.730
It's OK now. It's OK.

01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:18.640
My god!

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.020
You know...

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.570
You don't have to thank me,

01:12:28.570 --> 01:12:31.560
but can you put that away?

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:35.040
Yoo-bin.

01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:38.190
Who are you? Why did you save us?

01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:43.150
Weren't you the one who called for help?

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:48.780
There wasn't supposed to be anyone on the 8th floor.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.730
How did you two stay alive?

01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:06.100
It's not easy staying alive.

01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:10.500
I thought I was the only one still alive in this building.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.780
Yeah, we thought we were the only two left alive.

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.080
That everyone had already changed.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.830
You would think that.

01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:22.250
But that's not the case anymore, right?

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:25.050
Right. There's three of us.

01:13:25.530 --> 01:13:28.170
But it seems like you two understand it well,

01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:31.010
what kind of creatures they are.

01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:33.050
Since we're alive, of course we know.

01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:35.780
We're stuck at home, and it's the only thing on TV.

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.210
It was the same for me too.

01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:39.440
But how did you two end up coming together?

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:40.420
Do you know each other?

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.660
No, we don't.

01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:44.460
We met about 4 days ago.

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:48.210
But, mister, have you been on your own the whole time?

01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:52.290
Well... I guess.

01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:56.700
What's wrong? You should drink.

01:13:58.700 --> 01:13:59.690
What is it?

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:02.440
Right.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.850
With the way the world's changed,

01:14:06.850 --> 01:14:08.610
it's not unreasonable to be skeptical.

01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:22.080
Drink. It's OK.

01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:29.220
You must be hungry. 
Do you want something to eat?

01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:34.750
Spam.

01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:45.150
How is it?

01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:47.290
It's amazing.

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:49.770
Glad to hear it.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.260
Take your time.

01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:00.300
There's enough to eat until the rescue team comes, 
so take your time.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.130
- Rescue team? 
- Really?

01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:04.360
Rescue team?!

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.240
Didn't you hear the broadcast?

01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:09.630
Isn't that why you came here?

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.980
Did you really hear it?

01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:15.550
It comes on the broadcast sometimes.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.700
You really didn't hear about it?

01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:33.020
We made it.

01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:38.930
Yes. Just hang on a little longer.

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:51.600
But how did you stay hidden?

01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:56.670
You get good at it with age.

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:01.790
Hiding from my wife to smoke 
ended up coming in handy.

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:18.200
Do you have any kids?

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:22.440
No.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.000
But two kids did come today.

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:28.600
What?

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:41.870
Mister.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:53.720
Mister...

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.690
Joon-woo.

01:16:57.330 --> 01:16:58.750
Joon...

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.500
Just go to sleep.

01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:22.220
That's right. Just like that.

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:25.970
Joon-woo...

01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:24.180
My wife...

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:27.330
...has been starving for days.

01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:30.330
If not for you...

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.860
...who knows how much longer it would have been.

01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:38.750
I had no choice.

01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:42.820
Joon-woo!

01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:44.200
Please understand.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.570
What a bunch of bullshit.

01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:53.100
Yoo-bin!

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:54.930
Yoo-bin, are you inside?

01:19:54.930 --> 01:19:56.130
Can you hear me?

01:19:56.130 --> 01:19:58.100
Yoo-bin, answer me!

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:00.820
Is it wrong for me to want to save my wife?

01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:05.370
It's not like you two haven't killed anyone.

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:08.780
That's right.

01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:12.640
The fact that you're still alive

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:15.540
means that we're the same.

01:20:15.570 --> 01:20:16.660
Mister.

01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:19.290
Mister, wait a minute.

01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:22.330
Let's talk it out.

01:20:22.330 --> 01:20:25.370
OK. Let's do that.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.460

01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:44.370
Please!

01:20:45.850 --> 01:20:47.850
Just let us live, won't you?

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:50.320
Are we just supposed to die then?!

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.340
What the hell did we do wrong?

01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:54.020
Let go!

01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:57.880
Then... just leave the girl.

01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:00.720
I'll let you live.

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:03.820
You can have all the food here.

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.810
Just this once.

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.530
Stay away!

01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:13.010
- Just once! 
- Stay away or I'm going to kill you!

01:21:14.890 --> 01:21:17.720
Just pretend nothing happened and leave!

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.850
I'm going to kill you! Stay away!

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:28.980
Yoo-bin! Yoo-bin!

01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:32.400
Yoo-bin! Yoo-bin!

01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:55.380
Honey.

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.460
Honey!

01:22:02.730 --> 01:22:03.810
Yoo-bin!

01:22:12.670 --> 01:22:14.050
It's OK.

01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:19.770
It's OK, dear.

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:27.060
You've done well.

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:36.890
It's OK.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:39.250
It's OK.

It's OK. It's OK.

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.740
It's OK...

01:23:33.850 --> 01:23:35.240
Joon-woo.

01:23:51.150 --> 01:23:53.060
We're still human.

01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:55.770
We're together.

01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:03.650
It's OK now.

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.020
No...

01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:22.260
Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:34.730
Shit.

01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:42.860

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.120
Shit.

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.810
Where are the scissors?

01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:23.070
Out of the way!

01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:26.180

01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:24.260
Go! Go!

01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:26.480
Hurry and catch the helicopter!

01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:30.720
You have to come quickly!

01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:07.460
No... No...

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:26.560
Shit! This fucking apartment!

01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:38.780
The helicopter. Where is it?

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.600
There are people here...

01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:57.480
There are people here!

We're here!

- There are people here!

01:29:23.230 --> 01:29:25.700
We're still alive.

01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:20.270

Two survivors have been rescued from Eunsol Apartments.

01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:28.540
We're transferring them to the rescue area. Over.

- Joon-woo, contact me when you see this. ]

01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:59.040
It's currently impossible to confirm the number of infected.

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:03.010
The government estimates at least 50,000 infected.

01:32:03.010 --> 01:32:06.570
Densely populated apartment blocks

01:32:06.570 --> 01:32:09.810
were especially heavily hit.

01:32:09.810 --> 01:32:12.730
Currently, rescue teams are looking

01:32:12.730 --> 01:32:18.920
to save residents who have posted 
rescue messages on social media.

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:23.480
Fortunately, as internet and phone services recover,

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:26.440
there is hope in social media rescue posts.

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:30.100
On this matter, under the new regulations, 
disaster response teams

01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:36.940
plan to spread the location 
of those in refuge via social media.
