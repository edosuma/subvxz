00:45.041 --> 00:47.958
<i>By the time</i>
<i>Master Geppetto made Pinocchio,</i>

00:48.041 --> 00:49.916
<i>he had already lost a son.</i>

00:52.833 --> 00:55.333
<i>Now this was quite a few years</i>
<i>before my time,</i>

00:55.916 --> 00:57.416
<i>but I learnt the story.</i>

00:57.916 --> 00:59.458
<i>And then it became my story.</i>

01:03.708 --> 01:06.791
<i>Geppetto lost Carlo during the Great War.</i>

01:07.375 --> 01:09.583
<i>They'd been together only ten years.</i>

01:11.166 --> 01:15.416
<i>But it was as if Carlo had taken</i>
<i>the old man's life with him.</i>

01:28.833 --> 01:30.166
Whoa.

01:33.625 --> 01:34.833
Whoa!

01:44.833 --> 01:46.416
-Papa! Papa!
-Yes?

01:46.500 --> 01:48.416
-Guess what I saw?
-What?

01:48.500 --> 01:50.541
-Guess!
-I've no idea.

01:50.625 --> 01:54.333
-I saw some planes!
-Oh, did you? Good.

01:55.291 --> 01:58.291
-What is it you're making this time, Papa?
-Guess!

01:58.375 --> 02:00.833
-A soldier? A magician? A witch?
-No.

02:00.916 --> 02:04.416
No! No, no, no, no, no,
you have to wait and see, Carlo!

02:04.500 --> 02:07.916
-All good things require patience.

02:08.416 --> 02:09.291
Huh.

02:12.250 --> 02:13.625
<i>They wanted for nothing.</i>

02:13.708 --> 02:17.250
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

02:17.333 --> 02:19.833
<i>All they needed</i>
<i>was each other's company.</i>

02:19.916 --> 02:23.833
And the old witch
warned the little hedgehog,

02:23.916 --> 02:30.583
"Do not tell lies,
or your nose will grow and grow

02:30.666 --> 02:31.791
up to here!"

02:34.416 --> 02:36.083
His nose would grow?

02:36.708 --> 02:41.041
Lies, my dear boy,
are found out immediately

02:41.125 --> 02:43.416
because they are like long noses,

02:43.500 --> 02:47.583
visible to all but the teller of the lie.

02:47.666 --> 02:52.208
And the more you lie, the more it grows!

02:59.083 --> 03:02.583
Sing me Mama's song so I can sleep.
Please, Papa?

03:02.666 --> 03:04.791
All right.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.458
-Higher, Papa! Higher!

03:44.708 --> 03:45.708
Try it.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.208
-Thank you, ladies.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.541
-For you.

04:03.625 --> 04:05.666
-For me?

04:28.125 --> 04:30.666
Pull, Carlo! Pull!

04:30.750 --> 04:34.083
-Magnificent job, Geppetto.

04:34.166 --> 04:35.666
-Thank you.

04:42.541 --> 04:43.791
Watch out, Carlo!

04:50.125 --> 04:53.166
When one life is lost,
another must grow.

04:54.416 --> 04:55.750
How about this one?

04:57.291 --> 04:59.208
No, no, no, no, Carlo.

04:59.291 --> 05:01.375
It has to be perfect. Complete!

05:01.458 --> 05:02.458
See?

05:03.541 --> 05:06.333
This one's missing some of its scales.

05:36.833 --> 05:38.166
Good night, Papa.

05:40.208 --> 05:41.708
Good night, my son.

05:44.208 --> 05:46.125
I love my new shoes, Papa!

05:46.916 --> 05:48.625
I am very glad, Carlo.

05:49.291 --> 05:52.333
-We're going to church first, right?
-Oh, yes. Yes.

05:54.916 --> 05:56.208
Hello there, little dog!

05:59.791 --> 06:01.791
<i>Buongiorno, Geppetto.</i>

06:03.000 --> 06:04.916
-Morning!
-Morning.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.750
Master Geppetto,
you gonna finish the crucifix today?

06:08.833 --> 06:10.333
We're gonna do our best.

06:11.416 --> 06:14.333
-Ladies.
-Aw, such a perfectionist.

06:18.208 --> 06:20.333
A model Italian citizen.

06:20.416 --> 06:21.916
And such a good father.

06:25.208 --> 06:27.708
Carlo, nice shoes. Catch!

06:28.208 --> 06:29.208
Thank you, sir!

06:29.291 --> 06:30.750
-Good morning.
-Hi!

06:33.041 --> 06:36.541
-<i>Buongiorno.</i>
-<i>Buongiorno, Dottore!</i>

06:40.083 --> 06:41.625
Ah, Carlo.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.583
Geppetto.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.333
Yes…

06:57.416 --> 06:59.041
-It looks great, Papa.
-Oh.

06:59.625 --> 07:01.666
Is it almost time to go home?

07:02.250 --> 07:03.208
Almost!

07:03.291 --> 07:06.250
-Send up a little more red for me, Carlo.

07:16.541 --> 07:18.875
Oh! I forgot to show you what I found.

07:18.958 --> 07:20.166
What is it, my boy?

07:21.541 --> 07:22.541
You'll see.

07:28.708 --> 07:31.083
-Ta-da!

07:31.625 --> 07:33.958
The perfect pine cone.

07:34.458 --> 07:36.000
It still has all its scales!

07:36.083 --> 07:39.375
I thought I could plant it myself
and watch the tree grow.

07:39.958 --> 07:43.416
And then carve toys for myself.
Like you do.

07:43.500 --> 07:48.875
I think that's as good an idea
as any boy ever had, Carlo.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.500
Isn't it?

07:58.208 --> 08:00.833
What's that sound, Papa? Is it a plane?

08:03.500 --> 08:04.541
Gather the tools.

08:05.041 --> 08:05.958
Quickly.

08:06.875 --> 08:11.916
We'll go home to a warm fire and hot soup.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.541
-Could we have some hot chocolate too?
-Sure. Sure.

08:14.625 --> 08:17.583
It seems like a hot chocolate sort of day,
doesn't it?

08:17.666 --> 08:19.583
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Fine.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.833
Papa! What is it?

08:21.916 --> 08:24.500
Nothing. I'm sure it's nothing but…

08:25.083 --> 08:26.583
Oh, wait. My pine cone!

08:34.666 --> 08:38.666
<i>It was later said Geppetto's</i>
<i>little town was not even a target.</i>

08:41.000 --> 08:43.083
<i>That these planes</i>
<i>were heading back to base</i>

08:44.125 --> 08:47.416
<i>and simply let go of their bombs</i>
<i>to make their ballasts lighter.</i>

08:56.458 --> 08:57.291
Carlo!

09:04.166 --> 09:05.083
Ah!

09:15.625 --> 09:18.458
Huh?

09:21.958 --> 09:23.666
Huh?

09:25.208 --> 09:26.208
No…

09:32.958 --> 09:34.041
Carlo.

10:16.625 --> 10:21.041
<i>Geppetto never left his side.</i>
<i>And that was that.</i>

10:21.875 --> 10:25.375
<i>He worked very little. He ate even less.</i>

10:26.458 --> 10:29.625
<i>And the church's crucifix</i>
<i>remained unfinished.</i>

10:34.625 --> 10:36.958
-<i>The years passed.</i>

10:40.666 --> 10:42.083
<i>The world moved on…</i>

10:45.666 --> 10:47.083
<i>but Geppetto did not.</i>

11:02.083 --> 11:04.208
<i>And this is where I come in.</i>

11:08.666 --> 11:10.333
<i>You see, I was a writer.</i>

11:10.416 --> 11:12.958
<i>And for years, I'd been looking</i>
<i>for the ideal conditions to set</i>

11:13.041 --> 11:16.541
<i>my illustrious,</i>
<i>fascinating life story to paper.</i>

11:24.458 --> 11:25.750
<i>Until, at long last,</i>

11:27.083 --> 11:28.250
<i>I found it.</i>

11:31.250 --> 11:32.958
<i>My sanctuary.</i>

11:33.666 --> 11:34.500
<i>Home.</i>

11:34.583 --> 11:35.666
Ah.

11:35.750 --> 11:40.125
<i>Here I could write my memoirs.</i>
<i>And what a tale it would be.</i>

11:41.541 --> 11:44.333
<i>I had lived</i>
<i>in a barrister's fireplace in Sardinia,</i>

11:44.416 --> 11:46.708
<i>sailed on the Adriatic in a fishing boat,</i>

11:46.791 --> 11:50.916
<i>nested one Perugian winter</i>
<i>with an acclaimed sculptor.</i>

11:53.125 --> 11:55.625
Stridulations of My Youth

11:56.250 --> 11:58.708
<i>by Sebastian J. Cricket.</i>

12:01.541 --> 12:04.000
I dreamed of you, Carlo.

12:07.125 --> 12:11.833
I dreamed you were
right back here with me.

12:14.208 --> 12:15.208
My son.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.083
Oh dear.

12:21.750 --> 12:24.750
If only I could have you back.

12:24.833 --> 12:26.416
I am so sorry.

12:28.625 --> 12:32.041
<i>I watched the old man weep.</i>
<i>And it moved me.</i>

12:33.000 --> 12:35.833
<i>And it turns out</i>
<i>that I wasn't the only one watching him.</i>

12:38.791 --> 12:41.166
<i>In my many wanderings on this earth,</i>

12:41.250 --> 12:46.083
<i>I've learned that there are old spirits</i>
<i>living in the mountains, in the forests,</i>

12:46.166 --> 12:49.083
<i>who rarely involve themselves</i>
<i>in the human world.</i>

12:49.166 --> 12:51.500
<i>But on occasion, they do.</i>

12:53.208 --> 12:55.208
I want you back, Carlo.

12:56.916 --> 12:59.291
Right here!

13:00.416 --> 13:01.541
With me!

13:02.833 --> 13:06.208
-Why won't you listen to my prayers?

13:06.291 --> 13:08.000
Why?

13:12.916 --> 13:14.208
Where were we?

13:14.958 --> 13:16.750
Ah yes. Perug--

13:16.833 --> 13:18.416
-Whoa!

13:18.500 --> 13:19.875
What in my antennae?

13:23.041 --> 13:25.875
I will have him back.

13:25.958 --> 13:30.166
I'll make Carlo again…

13:30.250 --> 13:31.750
Wha-- Hey!

13:31.833 --> 13:35.041
…out of this accursed pine!

13:37.083 --> 13:39.458
Whoa! Ah!

14:00.750 --> 14:02.583
-What on earth?!

14:03.625 --> 14:04.791
No!

14:10.833 --> 14:12.875
-Ah! Ooh! Yah!

14:12.958 --> 14:15.291
It's a house of horrors!

14:26.833 --> 14:28.000
Ah!

14:29.875 --> 14:30.875
Ah!

14:31.583 --> 14:32.916
Ah!

15:22.916 --> 15:24.666
Huh?

15:29.916 --> 15:34.375
I… I will finish you tomorrow.

15:35.041 --> 15:37.166
Yes, tomorrow.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.750
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

15:44.833 --> 15:46.666
Hey! Get away from there. Go away!

15:48.500 --> 15:49.708
Bugger off.

15:50.666 --> 15:53.208
No, no, no, no, no, no. This is my home!

15:53.291 --> 15:54.875
No trespassing. Go! Go! Go! Go!

15:54.958 --> 15:57.583
Get away from here. Go away! Go away!

15:57.666 --> 15:58.750
Yes, that's right.

16:25.583 --> 16:27.458
Little wooden boy,

16:27.541 --> 16:32.000
may you rise with the sun
and walk the earth.

16:32.083 --> 16:35.833
Excuse me. Can I help you?
This is my home we're talking about.

16:37.458 --> 16:40.416
May I ask, who on earth are you?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.500
On earth?

16:42.583 --> 16:43.750
A guardian.

16:43.833 --> 16:46.333
-I care for the little things…

16:46.416 --> 16:47.875
…the forgotten things,

16:47.958 --> 16:49.250
the lost ones.

16:49.333 --> 16:52.750
Well, I am
Sebastian J. Cricket, homeowner.

16:52.833 --> 16:56.500
And I have every right to be consulted
about your schemes and machinations

16:56.583 --> 16:58.333
regarding my property.

16:58.416 --> 17:03.166
Well, since you already live
in the heart of the wooden boy,

17:03.250 --> 17:04.625
perhaps you can help me.

17:05.208 --> 17:06.166
Help you what?

17:06.750 --> 17:08.125
To watch over him.

17:08.625 --> 17:10.708
Guide him to be good.

17:10.791 --> 17:12.625
I'm not a governess, madam.

17:12.708 --> 17:15.250
I'm a novelist, a raconteur,

17:15.333 --> 17:18.041
currently immersed in writing my memoirs.

17:18.125 --> 17:22.541
Well, in this world,
you get what you give.

17:23.041 --> 17:27.875
Take on this responsibility,
and I will grant you one wish.

17:27.958 --> 17:30.291
And that could be anything?

17:30.375 --> 17:31.625
Anything at all?

17:31.708 --> 17:33.458
The publication of my book?

17:33.541 --> 17:34.875
Fame? Fortune?

17:34.958 --> 17:36.291
Anything.

17:36.375 --> 17:37.208
Oh.

17:37.291 --> 17:41.375
Maybe I can help. I'll try my best,
and that's the best anyone can do.

17:41.958 --> 17:43.625
That's rather clever, isn't it?

17:44.583 --> 17:47.250
Little wooden boy made of pine,

17:48.416 --> 17:51.875
we shall call you Pinocchio.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.250
May you rise with the sun

17:55.583 --> 17:57.375
and wander the earth…

17:58.250 --> 17:59.541
Ah!

18:03.250 --> 18:08.166
…and bring joy and company
to that poor heartbroken man.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.250
Be his son.

18:11.083 --> 18:16.625
Fill his days with light
so he'll never be alone.

18:36.041 --> 18:36.958
Ah.

18:50.750 --> 18:51.625
Huh.

19:21.916 --> 19:23.375
Who goes there?

19:27.208 --> 19:29.458
I'm… I'm warning you!

19:32.750 --> 19:34.416
I… I have a weapon!

19:42.958 --> 19:44.375
-Wha--

19:51.500 --> 19:53.875
Good morning, Papa!

19:55.250 --> 19:58.000
What is this? What kind of sorcery?

19:58.083 --> 20:01.666
You wanted me to live.
You asked for me to live.

20:01.750 --> 20:03.083
Who… Who are you?

20:05.375 --> 20:07.625
My name is Pinocchio!

20:07.708 --> 20:09.083
I'm your son!

20:09.666 --> 20:12.500
You are not my son! Don't come near me!

20:12.583 --> 20:14.458
The boy's telling the truth,
Master Geppetto!

20:14.541 --> 20:16.875
It's full of cockroaches!

20:17.375 --> 20:18.583
Ah!

20:21.333 --> 20:22.833
Ugh.

20:23.625 --> 20:24.583
Ah!

20:42.416 --> 20:43.791
Wow!

20:43.875 --> 20:45.291
Ah! Huh?

20:46.375 --> 20:48.291
What is this?

20:54.250 --> 20:56.708
Huh? No, no, get away from me!

21:00.333 --> 21:02.916
You… You stand back! Don't come near me!

21:09.666 --> 21:12.000
It's a clock. Don't touch it.

21:13.875 --> 21:16.083
It sings at six o'clock.

21:19.416 --> 21:21.416
No! Ah!

21:27.833 --> 21:29.041
That's a hammer.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.750
You tap. You smash. You shatter.

21:33.833 --> 21:36.208
-Ugh!

22:06.000 --> 22:09.833
-Uh, a ch… chamber pot.

22:10.416 --> 22:14.041
-Um, uh, I… Oh.

22:17.583 --> 22:18.791
-Ah!

22:29.208 --> 22:31.333
-Don't…

22:34.833 --> 22:35.958
You must stop!

22:38.500 --> 22:41.416
That was so much fun, Papa!

22:41.500 --> 22:43.625
You're not my son!

22:48.416 --> 22:50.250
What is wrong with you?

22:51.625 --> 22:52.541
Papa?

22:54.291 --> 22:55.416
I'm sorry.

23:14.625 --> 23:16.083
I, uh…

23:19.541 --> 23:22.500
Just stay here. Don't come out.

23:24.166 --> 23:25.666
Time for church.

23:25.750 --> 23:28.375
-Church? I wanna go to church.
Stay there.

23:28.458 --> 23:30.333
-Church! Church!
-Do you understand?

23:30.416 --> 23:32.291
Church! Church! Church! Church!

23:33.625 --> 23:34.500
Church!

23:34.583 --> 23:36.666
No, no, he told you to stay.

23:36.750 --> 23:41.458
-I'm going to church! I'm going to church!
-No, no, no! Please, stop!

23:41.541 --> 23:42.708
You must obey your papa.

23:43.708 --> 23:44.541
Obey?

23:44.625 --> 23:46.500
To do as you're told!

23:46.583 --> 23:48.583
But I don't want to obey!

23:48.666 --> 23:50.708
Well…

23:50.791 --> 23:54.708
…you must try your best,
and that's the best anybody can do.

23:58.333 --> 24:00.750
-I'm going to church!

24:00.833 --> 24:03.416
I'm going to church!

24:09.041 --> 24:10.125
Whoa!

24:16.000 --> 24:17.708
-Hi!

24:18.958 --> 24:20.125
Okay, bye!

24:22.083 --> 24:22.958
Hmm.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.791
Oops.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.666
Uh, uh, ah!

25:04.416 --> 25:07.583
-Look, Father, over there!

25:07.666 --> 25:09.041
What is that?

25:11.416 --> 25:12.250
Papa!

25:12.333 --> 25:14.541
-It speaks!

25:16.375 --> 25:18.791
Papa! Papa! Over here!

25:18.875 --> 25:20.166
Pinocchio.

25:20.250 --> 25:21.583
It's me!

25:21.666 --> 25:23.750
I came to church.

25:23.833 --> 25:26.458
-It's a demon!
-Witchcraft!

25:26.541 --> 25:27.458
<i>Malocchio!</i>

25:27.541 --> 25:28.666
Pinocchio.

25:28.750 --> 25:30.625
No! No, please!

25:30.708 --> 25:33.625
It's… It's a puppet
to… to entertain!

25:33.708 --> 25:36.083
If he's a puppet, where are his strings?

25:36.166 --> 25:39.166
That's true. Who controls you, wooden boy?

25:39.250 --> 25:41.250
Of course, I control him--

25:41.333 --> 25:42.708
Who controls you?

25:45.833 --> 25:49.666
No one talks to the Podesta like that.

25:49.750 --> 25:52.041
He… He's a puppet. Just a puppet!

25:52.125 --> 25:56.041
No, I'm not. I'm made
of flesh and bone and meaty bits!

25:56.125 --> 25:58.708
-I'm a real boy!

25:58.791 --> 26:00.958
-A monster!
-Demon!

26:01.041 --> 26:04.083
-It's an abomination.

26:04.166 --> 26:07.458
-This is the work of the devil!
-Enough!

26:07.958 --> 26:11.583
This is a house of God.

26:11.666 --> 26:13.041
You drunken fool!

26:13.125 --> 26:14.791
You carving this… this thing

26:14.875 --> 26:18.166
while our blessed Christ
hangs unfinished all these years?

26:18.250 --> 26:21.750
Take that unholy thing away.
Take it away! Now!

26:23.500 --> 26:24.708
Yes. Yes, Padre.

26:24.791 --> 26:26.833
-Shame on you, Geppetto!
-Burn him!

26:26.916 --> 26:28.208
-So sorry.
-Chop him up!

26:28.291 --> 26:29.625
-Oh <i>Dio mio.</i>
-Sorry, sorry.

26:29.708 --> 26:31.208
-He'll be fine.

26:31.291 --> 26:34.541
-Curse you, Geppetto!
- The Lord will punish him!

26:34.625 --> 26:36.708
-Get out!

26:42.625 --> 26:45.166
-Stop fidgeting, please.
-Hello!

26:51.208 --> 26:53.791
Carlo never acted like this.

26:53.875 --> 26:56.958
Papa, why did my nose grow today?

26:58.458 --> 27:00.250
You lied, Pinocchio,

27:00.333 --> 27:05.250
and a lie is plain to see
as your nose and--

27:05.333 --> 27:08.375
And the more you lie, the more it grows.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.083
-Is that it?
-That…

27:11.166 --> 27:13.666
-Yes, that's it.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.166
-There you go.
-Chocolate.

27:28.250 --> 27:30.000
-Thank you, Geppetto.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.333
We appreciate your hospitality.

27:32.416 --> 27:34.750
Candlewick, go sit by the fire.

27:35.333 --> 27:40.000
We are here to talk about
the incident at the church today.

27:40.958 --> 27:44.250
The community was startled
by your creation.

27:44.333 --> 27:45.666
As Podesta,

27:45.750 --> 27:50.458
I must ensure that this puppet of yours
poses no threat to our community.

27:50.541 --> 27:52.583
Oh, no, no, nothing like that.

27:52.666 --> 27:54.625
Oh! Is that

27:55.625 --> 27:56.958
hot chocolate?

27:57.625 --> 28:00.416
You're a puppet!
You've never eaten anything in your life!

28:00.500 --> 28:04.375
Oh! Oh, that must be why I'm so hungry!

28:05.000 --> 28:08.333
Oh, I'm starving, Papa.
I'm starving to death!

28:08.416 --> 28:09.458
You are not!

28:09.541 --> 28:13.291
Now go sit by the fire
and let me talk to our guests.

28:13.375 --> 28:16.000
But I don't want to! I want hot chocolate!

28:16.083 --> 28:19.083
-Please, Papa. Please! Please! Please!
-There, there now.

28:19.166 --> 28:20.208
Here you go.

28:20.291 --> 28:23.541
Oh boy! Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

28:23.625 --> 28:27.833
Yes. Yes, Pinocchio.
Go… Go warm your feet by the fire.

28:27.916 --> 28:29.375
Obey your papa.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.916
Oh yes, I will obey if I get chocolate.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.041
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

28:35.791 --> 28:38.791
He really is a charming boy.

28:38.875 --> 28:43.333
Podesta watches over the town's
moral well-being, you understand?

28:43.833 --> 28:46.208
His authority cannot be questioned--

28:46.291 --> 28:48.625
That's right!
And I won't be mocked!

28:48.708 --> 28:52.000
I will do just as you wish.
You have my word.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.916
-So, what about this wooden boy?
-Ah.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.458
Will you let him run wild
through town all day?

28:58.541 --> 29:02.250
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll keep him locked up!

29:02.333 --> 29:03.458
Right here in the house.

29:03.541 --> 29:05.166
I won't be locked up.

29:05.250 --> 29:07.666
I'll smash the windows out, I will.

29:07.750 --> 29:10.458
This abnormal boy lacks discipline.

29:11.041 --> 29:16.166
But he seems strong, sturdy,
made of good Italian pine.

29:16.250 --> 29:18.625
-Oh, very good pine, yes.

29:18.708 --> 29:22.125
Not perfect, you see,
but, uh, he means well.

29:22.666 --> 29:26.583
Hey. Try to get closer to the fire
to get warm.

29:26.666 --> 29:27.958
Son, come here.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.250
Look at my boy, Candlewick.

29:36.333 --> 29:37.250
Yes. Yes.

29:37.333 --> 29:38.666
A model fascist youth.

29:39.166 --> 29:40.583
Proud and brave.

29:41.083 --> 29:43.166
Virile, like his father.

29:43.250 --> 29:47.333
And his teeth, perfect teeth.
And no sign of jaundice.

29:47.416 --> 29:49.041
Papa? Papa!

29:49.125 --> 29:51.750
My feet feel hot, like chocolate.

29:51.833 --> 29:52.750
Look!

29:53.833 --> 29:55.250
Ah! What?!

29:55.875 --> 29:58.208
Fire! My house is on fire!

29:58.291 --> 30:01.750
-Yes! Look at me!

30:01.833 --> 30:06.166
Look! I'm on fire! Yay!

30:08.291 --> 30:12.916
Aw. Look what you did, Papa.
You've ruined the nice light on my feet.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.708
This is what you get
with an undisciplined mind.

30:15.791 --> 30:17.875
You must send this child to school.

30:18.375 --> 30:21.041
To school? Pinocchio?

30:21.125 --> 30:23.250
Yes. Tomorrow.

30:26.333 --> 30:28.291
School.

30:34.708 --> 30:37.208
Oh, what a day. What a day.

30:37.291 --> 30:39.958
Oh, what a day. What a day.

30:41.500 --> 30:42.833
Time for bed.

30:48.041 --> 30:53.375
You know, Papa, I like my old legs.
And I like them on fire.

30:53.458 --> 30:55.541
Pinocchio, if you go to sleep,

30:55.625 --> 30:58.583
I'll make you a new pair of legs
in the morning.

30:58.666 --> 31:00.375
Just like the old ones?

31:00.458 --> 31:03.166
Better than the old ones.

31:03.250 --> 31:07.208
Better? Can I have cricket legs, Papa?
Can you make me four of them?

31:07.291 --> 31:10.041
No, no, no, no. No, just two.

31:10.666 --> 31:12.333
Two will do.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.250
Good night, Papa.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.791
Good night, my…

31:19.708 --> 31:22.750
Good night, Pinocchio.

31:27.083 --> 31:28.333
Sebastian?

31:33.375 --> 31:34.625
Yes, Pinocchio?

31:36.916 --> 31:38.041
Who's Carlo?

31:40.541 --> 31:41.916
Carlo was a boy.

31:42.875 --> 31:45.041
Geppetto lost him many years ago.

31:45.625 --> 31:50.500
Where did he put him?
How can you lose a whole person?

31:50.583 --> 31:53.916
I mean, he… he died, Pinocchio.

31:54.583 --> 31:55.916
He's no longer alive.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.375
Is that a bad thing?

31:58.875 --> 32:03.041
Yes. It's a great burden
for a father to lose a child so young.

32:05.041 --> 32:06.458
What's a burden?

32:08.416 --> 32:12.041
It's something painful you must carry

32:13.375 --> 32:15.791
even though it hurts you very much.

32:25.666 --> 32:27.583
<i>I wrote a lot that night.</i>

32:27.666 --> 32:29.583
<i>I had so much to say.</i>

32:29.666 --> 32:32.041
<i>Not about my own life, for a change,</i>

32:32.791 --> 32:36.041
<i>but about imperfect fathers</i>
<i>and imperfect sons.</i>

32:36.125 --> 32:38.541
<i>And about loss and love.</i>

32:38.625 --> 32:39.666
Hmm.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.791
<i>And for that one evening,</i>
<i>at least,</i>

32:41.875 --> 32:46.083
<i>we were, all of us, blissfully oblivious.</i>

32:46.791 --> 32:48.375
You were right, Papa!

32:48.458 --> 32:52.125
These legs are much, much, much,
<i>much</i> better than the old ones!

32:53.708 --> 32:58.083
Ha! Look at me! I can walk backwards. Hup!

32:58.166 --> 32:59.916
And… And jump forwards!

33:00.000 --> 33:00.833
Hup!

33:00.916 --> 33:03.625
-I couldn't do it before!
-Huh?

33:05.750 --> 33:10.958
Ooh, Papa! Can you see this?
He looks just like me.

33:15.250 --> 33:16.708
What is that?

33:20.041 --> 33:22.500
Pinocchio! Come on.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

33:23.750 --> 33:27.291
Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
I love these new legs, Papa.

33:28.166 --> 33:30.250
-Can we go to the carnival?
-Hmm.

33:30.333 --> 33:32.583
Perhaps, Pinocchio. Perhaps.

33:33.458 --> 33:35.833
Right now we have work to do.

33:35.916 --> 33:38.708
-Work? I love work!
-Hmm.

33:38.791 --> 33:40.750
Papa, what is work?

33:40.833 --> 33:45.000
Oh, Pinocchio, please.
No more questions.

33:45.083 --> 33:46.083
Huh.

34:00.291 --> 34:02.375
-Stupid monkey!

34:03.875 --> 34:05.125
-Whoa!

34:23.458 --> 34:24.791
I'm coming!

34:26.791 --> 34:29.791
What is it? What are you doing here?

34:29.875 --> 34:31.416
Ah!

34:31.500 --> 34:34.125
I told you to put up posters
and draw big crowds.

34:34.208 --> 34:36.750
This carnival is going to pot! And you?!

34:36.833 --> 34:40.458
Can you not see
how desperate the situation is?

34:45.083 --> 34:45.916
A what?

34:48.541 --> 34:52.208
A living puppet? Are you absolutely sure?

34:56.083 --> 34:58.333
This could get us to the top again!

34:59.250 --> 35:02.583
This could make us kings again!

35:36.375 --> 35:39.958
-Hey!

36:15.125 --> 36:17.625
-Now let it down.

36:19.291 --> 36:21.833
More. That's it. That's it.

36:21.916 --> 36:24.291
Just a little more. Stop.

36:26.833 --> 36:27.916
There we go.

36:31.875 --> 36:34.666
Very good, child. Very good.

36:35.208 --> 36:38.458
Papa, there's something
I don't understand.

36:38.541 --> 36:40.125
What is it, Pinocchio?

36:40.916 --> 36:42.500
Everybody likes <i>him</i>.

36:43.125 --> 36:44.125
Who?

36:44.208 --> 36:45.041
Him.

36:45.666 --> 36:47.666
-Huh?
-They were all singing to him.

36:48.666 --> 36:50.375
He's made of wood too.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.708
Why do they like <i>him</i> and not me?

36:55.416 --> 36:57.166
Come here, Pinocchio.

37:01.083 --> 37:05.458
People are sometimes
afraid of things they don't know,

37:05.541 --> 37:12.125
but they'll get to know you
and like you, and for that, uh…

37:13.875 --> 37:15.291
Are you ready for school?

37:17.458 --> 37:20.291
Then I have something
I'd like to give you.

37:21.250 --> 37:22.458
Ta-da!

37:24.541 --> 37:26.041
I love it, Papa!

37:26.791 --> 37:28.541
I love it! I love it! I love it!

37:32.125 --> 37:33.041
What is it?

37:35.375 --> 37:36.708
It is a schoolbook.

37:37.458 --> 37:40.375
A very special schoolbook.

37:40.875 --> 37:44.458
One which belonged to a very special boy.

37:45.083 --> 37:48.291
Carlo, the boy you lost?

37:48.375 --> 37:49.333
Uh-huh.

37:49.833 --> 37:51.625
Was he a very good boy, Papa?

37:52.125 --> 37:53.166
Yes, he was.

37:56.250 --> 37:58.083
And you loved him very much?

37:58.750 --> 37:59.666
I did.

38:00.500 --> 38:02.416
I… I do.

38:04.916 --> 38:07.250
Then I will be just like Carlo!

38:07.333 --> 38:11.416
I will obey and go to school,
and I'll be the very, very best

38:11.500 --> 38:13.458
at… whatever they do there.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.500
I'll make you proud!

38:23.000 --> 38:24.833
Hup! Hup!

38:24.916 --> 38:26.208
Hup! Hup!

38:28.541 --> 38:29.833
He exists!

38:29.916 --> 38:34.000
Oh, this dream, this wonder exists!

38:34.083 --> 38:38.250
-You beautiful, brilliant baboon!

38:39.166 --> 38:40.125
I must have him.

38:40.875 --> 38:43.083
-Whoa!

38:46.458 --> 38:47.333
Hup!

38:47.416 --> 38:50.250
School! Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

38:50.916 --> 38:54.875
-What do you learn in school, Mr. Cricket?
-You'll learn reading and writing.

38:54.958 --> 38:57.458
You learn the multiplication tables!

38:57.541 --> 39:00.333
What's the <i>mulplitication</i> tables?

39:00.416 --> 39:04.708
Well, say you have four carts,
each with, uh, 27 apples.

39:04.791 --> 39:09.000
I don't care what the table says.
I have no apples, and I refuse to lie!

39:09.083 --> 39:10.541
Oh, no. It's just math!

39:10.625 --> 39:14.583
So you multiply the four and the seven…
four past seven? And you get--

39:14.666 --> 39:16.166
I get confused.

39:16.250 --> 39:19.041
I don't think
I like school anymore, Sebastian.

39:19.125 --> 39:21.458
Ah! We have found him!

39:21.541 --> 39:24.291
Look, Spazzatura! Our miracle!

39:24.375 --> 39:26.375
-Our sensation!
-Hey, watch it!

39:26.458 --> 39:28.125
Our star!

39:28.708 --> 39:29.708
Who? Me?

39:29.791 --> 39:31.291
Yes, <i>mon étoile</i>!

39:31.375 --> 39:34.625
I am Count Volpe! You have been chosen!

39:34.708 --> 39:38.458
Come partake in
the fun, fanciful, carefree carnival life

39:38.541 --> 39:42.291
as the star of my puppet show!

39:42.375 --> 39:44.000
Don't listen to him, Pinocchio!

39:44.083 --> 39:46.791
You promised your papa
you would go to school!

39:46.875 --> 39:50.333
Oh, yeah.
I promised my papa I'd go to school.

39:50.416 --> 39:53.250
See? He gave me Carlo's book.

39:54.041 --> 39:56.791
Carlo's book? Yes! Yes!

39:56.875 --> 39:59.208
A classical, canonical work.

39:59.291 --> 40:01.666
I can see
you're intrinsically an intellectual!

40:01.750 --> 40:06.166
But then now, book learning cannot compare
to witnessing the wide world

40:06.250 --> 40:11.041
with one's own eyes
from atop the glorious stage.

40:11.125 --> 40:13.000
-Wow.

40:13.666 --> 40:17.583
You shall see all
of the nations of the earth for yourself

40:17.666 --> 40:20.333
as they bow at your feet.

40:20.416 --> 40:22.416
My brand-new feet!

40:23.041 --> 40:24.958
No! No, wait!

40:25.041 --> 40:26.833
You have to go to school!

40:26.916 --> 40:29.916
Oh, can we do it tomorrow?

40:30.000 --> 40:32.375
Regretfully, no.

40:32.458 --> 40:34.125
For today's the only day

40:34.208 --> 40:37.625
that our cacophonous carnival
will visit your vicinity,

40:37.708 --> 40:41.125
but if you must go to school,
then you must go to school.

40:41.208 --> 40:43.250
Come, Spazzatura.

40:43.333 --> 40:44.916
We must find someone else

40:45.000 --> 40:48.541
to eat all our ice cream
and popcorn and hot chocolate.

40:48.625 --> 40:51.000
-Hot chocolate?
-Oh no.

40:51.083 --> 40:52.000
Yes, of course!

40:52.083 --> 40:55.541
All the hot chocolate you can drink
and all the games you can play.

40:55.625 --> 40:57.416
Oh boy, oh boy!

40:57.500 --> 41:01.625
Maybe it'll be okay
if I'm a little bit late for school?

41:01.708 --> 41:04.916
Yeah, perfectly fine.
No one will even notice.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.250
Don't listen to him, Pinocchio!

41:07.333 --> 41:10.500
Ah, we have
one last detail to take care of.

41:11.208 --> 41:12.166
Whoa!

41:12.250 --> 41:15.375
Sign here, here, and here. Need a pen?

41:16.125 --> 41:18.958
-No, Pinocchio! Don't!

41:22.916 --> 41:24.041
Like this?

41:26.291 --> 41:30.583
Perfect! I will now make you
burn bright like a star!

41:30.666 --> 41:32.583
Follow me, my boy!

41:39.458 --> 41:40.750
Oh, the pain.

41:40.833 --> 41:43.291
Life is such hideous pain.

41:47.291 --> 41:50.666
Master Geppetto,
would you mind coming down?

41:59.458 --> 42:02.000
Oh, at last!

42:02.083 --> 42:05.208
Our savior is restored.

42:18.208 --> 42:20.791
Oh, I'm… I'm so sorry.

42:23.833 --> 42:26.875
Your boy didn't show up at school today.

42:28.125 --> 42:31.333
But he left this morning.
I… I sent him there.

42:31.416 --> 42:34.291
Obviously, the puppet
is quite a dissident.

42:34.375 --> 42:36.875
An independent thinker, I'd say.

42:36.958 --> 42:40.000
-Uh, uh, uh, yes.
-You better look for him.

42:40.083 --> 42:44.625
I trust we will see
the wooden boy tomorrow at school.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.083
Tomorrow?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

42:51.541 --> 42:52.833
Ah!

42:53.750 --> 42:56.208
Boy, the carnival sure is grand.

42:56.291 --> 42:59.208
How about some more popcorn?

42:59.833 --> 43:03.250
Oh, I couldn't eat
another bite, Mr. Diavolo.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.458
I better get going to school, I guess.

43:08.541 --> 43:11.708
-Stay a while, Pinocchio.

43:11.791 --> 43:15.333
I am sorry to keep you waiting,
my little puppet.

43:15.916 --> 43:19.083
I don't like being called a puppet.

43:19.166 --> 43:22.958
My boy. Puppets are <i>le meilleur qui soit!</i>

43:23.041 --> 43:25.333
The tops! Lift your arm.

43:25.416 --> 43:28.375
Puppets are well respected
in every station of life.

43:28.458 --> 43:30.875
But I thought it was best
to be a normal boy.

43:30.958 --> 43:34.625
Oh, no, no, no. People love puppets.

43:34.708 --> 43:37.833
Like Il Diavolo, Columbina, Punchinello.

43:37.916 --> 43:41.708
Of course, there's but one puppet
who is king of them all!

43:41.791 --> 43:44.125
Oh boy, I'd like to meet that guy.

43:44.208 --> 43:48.041
Pinocchio!

43:48.125 --> 43:49.916
Wait. That's me!

43:50.458 --> 43:53.625
That's right. You are a wonder! A miracle.

43:53.708 --> 43:55.166
They'll love you!

43:55.250 --> 43:56.083
Who?

43:56.166 --> 43:57.333
<i>Les Idiots!</i>

43:57.416 --> 43:59.583
The wonderful children of the world!

43:59.666 --> 44:03.125
Lift your leg. Everyone shall love you
and call your name.

44:03.208 --> 44:07.916
-Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

44:08.000 --> 44:11.583
Pinocchio, the living puppet!

44:19.000 --> 44:21.750
Oh.

44:24.333 --> 44:25.833
A one and a two and…

44:32.875 --> 44:36.791
<i>
-Yeah!</i>

44:47.041 --> 44:50.500
-Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

44:55.958 --> 44:57.541
Pinocchio!

45:00.166 --> 45:01.041
No.

45:01.916 --> 45:03.583
Carlo's book.

45:06.375 --> 45:07.208
What?

45:08.541 --> 45:10.208
Over there.

45:14.916 --> 45:19.375
That song. How could he know that song?

45:23.166 --> 45:25.916
One nightmare after another.

45:39.208 --> 45:41.250
Yay! Pinocchio!

45:41.333 --> 45:42.250
Thank you!

45:42.333 --> 45:45.333
And all those treats are
for sale at the carnival.

45:45.416 --> 45:46.250
Thank you!

45:46.333 --> 45:49.083
Pinocchio? What's all this?

45:50.208 --> 45:51.291
What are you doing?

45:51.375 --> 45:52.541
Papa!

45:52.625 --> 45:55.791
I'm a star, Papa! A star!

45:55.875 --> 45:58.125
-They love me! They accept me!
-Oh, what are you--

45:58.208 --> 46:02.333
Enough of this nonsense.
You were supposed to be at school.

46:03.500 --> 46:06.250
And how do you know that song anyway?

46:07.791 --> 46:09.916
You simian simpleton!

46:11.583 --> 46:12.833
-My star!

46:12.916 --> 46:15.583
Where is my star?

46:16.291 --> 46:18.500
-Thank you. Thank you.

46:18.583 --> 46:19.958
Oh, you're very kind.

46:20.041 --> 46:25.916
You ruined Carlo's book,
and you didn't go to school! Why?

46:26.000 --> 46:29.458
You promised me
you would behave like… like… like--

46:29.541 --> 46:30.541
Carlo.

46:32.833 --> 46:33.916
Yes.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.250
I was going to, Papa, but… but…

46:36.958 --> 46:38.875
Yes, Pinocchio. What?

46:39.583 --> 46:42.000
Ten bandits came out
of the bushes and took--

46:43.541 --> 46:46.875
…out of the bushes,
and they took the book.

46:46.958 --> 46:48.750
Oh, I… I see.

46:48.833 --> 46:51.125
And then what happened?

46:51.208 --> 46:54.000
They had an axe,
and they wanted chocolate.

46:54.083 --> 46:55.250
Hot chocolate!

46:55.333 --> 46:58.708
Pinocchio, you shouldn't lie to me.

46:58.791 --> 47:00.166
I am your papa!

47:00.250 --> 47:02.708
-But I'm telling the truth!

47:03.208 --> 47:05.458
Then why is your nose growing?

47:05.541 --> 47:07.666
-It's not!

47:07.750 --> 47:10.791
Lies, lies, and more lies!

47:10.875 --> 47:13.458
I am not lying!

47:15.500 --> 47:17.125
Will you look at you?

47:22.583 --> 47:23.625
Go away!

47:23.708 --> 47:25.583
This is not a spectacle!

47:26.625 --> 47:28.166
But it is!

47:28.250 --> 47:30.750
Unhand my <i>carissimo</i>, you carousing…

47:32.625 --> 47:34.083
kleptomaniac!

47:34.166 --> 47:35.791
Do not touch him!

47:36.833 --> 47:38.041
I made him!

47:38.125 --> 47:39.750
And I discovered him!

47:39.833 --> 47:43.500
-He's not your puppet. He's mine!
-Oh!

47:43.583 --> 47:44.958
Perhaps we should--

47:45.041 --> 47:46.500
Oh, he is neither!

47:46.583 --> 47:50.583
-He's an actor. My actor.

47:51.291 --> 47:52.333
Give him to me!

47:52.416 --> 47:54.208
Never!

47:56.041 --> 47:57.916
-Oh dear.

48:00.208 --> 48:02.916
That was so much fun, Papa!

48:03.000 --> 48:04.125
-No!

48:11.041 --> 48:13.000
No…

48:17.333 --> 48:18.333
Pinocchio.

48:18.416 --> 48:20.250
He came out of nowhere!

48:20.333 --> 48:22.625
That's what happens
when you let your children run wild!

48:22.708 --> 48:24.125
<i>Pinocchio was dead.</i>

48:24.208 --> 48:27.208
<i>That much was apparent</i>
<i>to any astute observer.</i>

48:28.416 --> 48:32.083
<i>But little did I know</i>
<i>that death was not the end.</i>

48:44.958 --> 48:46.916
-Did you hear that?
-Who's there?

48:47.000 --> 48:50.958
-I thought he was dead.
-He is dead. I saw the paperwork myself.

48:51.041 --> 48:53.416
-Hello?

49:03.250 --> 49:05.416
All right. So, where were we?

49:05.500 --> 49:06.375
Whose deal?

49:06.458 --> 49:07.291
Mine, right?

49:07.791 --> 49:09.541
All right, boys, ante up.

49:09.625 --> 49:12.666
-What's the limit again?
-Twenty's the limit, ya mook.

49:12.750 --> 49:14.583
You got something under there, don't ya?

49:14.666 --> 49:17.458
Probably has a <i>leibedik</i> six.

49:17.541 --> 49:20.291
-Very funny.
-Are you playing a game?

49:21.083 --> 49:25.833
-Flush!
-I wanna play! Please, please, can I play?

49:25.916 --> 49:28.708
What part of dead
don't you understand, <i>schmendrick</i>?

49:28.791 --> 49:32.291
-It's boring in there. I hate being dead.

49:32.375 --> 49:34.291
Uh-oh, now you did it.

49:34.375 --> 49:35.250
What's that?

49:35.333 --> 49:36.750
Processing.

49:36.833 --> 49:38.958
Go see the boss, kid.

49:39.541 --> 49:40.916
Through there.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.083
-You'll see her.

49:43.583 --> 49:48.125
-Give me a freakin' ace, please.

50:02.416 --> 50:05.416
Hello? Hello?

50:08.958 --> 50:10.291
Who are you?

50:11.166 --> 50:14.083
I feel as though you've been here before.

50:14.166 --> 50:16.791
I am Pinocchio. I'm a boy.

50:16.875 --> 50:19.833
And I think I'm… dead.

50:19.916 --> 50:22.875
Ah, yes. I see.

50:24.333 --> 50:28.708
The wooden boy with the borrowed soul.

50:29.458 --> 50:31.291
My sister's folly.

50:31.375 --> 50:33.750
The sentimental fool.

50:34.541 --> 50:39.875
She gave you life, Pinocchio,
when you were not supposed to have it.

50:39.958 --> 50:43.375
No more than a chair or a table should.

50:44.166 --> 50:48.916
As a result, you cannot truly, truly die.

50:49.750 --> 50:51.125
Oh boy, oh boy!

50:51.208 --> 50:52.958
And… And that's good, right?

50:53.041 --> 50:55.166
Well, it means that you are not,

50:55.250 --> 50:59.625
nor will you ever be,
a real boy like Carlo.

51:01.375 --> 51:05.333
The one thing that makes human life
precious and meaningful, you see,

51:06.208 --> 51:07.875
is how brief it is.

51:08.833 --> 51:09.666
Oh.

51:10.958 --> 51:14.458
Don't get me wrong, you will die

51:14.541 --> 51:17.166
many, many times.

51:17.250 --> 51:19.125
This being one of them.

51:21.500 --> 51:23.666
But they are not real deaths.

51:24.666 --> 51:27.000
Just waiting periods.

51:28.291 --> 51:30.166
There are rules, you see.

51:31.916 --> 51:35.166
Despite my sister's disregard for them.

51:36.625 --> 51:40.125
We will both have to wait
for the sand to run out.

51:41.333 --> 51:46.750
You will stay here with me
a little longer each time you cross

51:46.833 --> 51:49.041
until the end of time.

51:51.416 --> 51:54.125
And then, after that sand runs out?

51:54.833 --> 51:58.041
I will simply send you back
every time.

51:58.625 --> 51:59.916
I see.

52:00.416 --> 52:04.416
Well, in that case,
I'd like to ask you one thing.

52:07.541 --> 52:09.083
See you next time.

52:15.375 --> 52:16.208
No.

52:19.458 --> 52:20.291
No.

52:20.875 --> 52:22.625
Ah, Pinocchio.

52:24.333 --> 52:27.875
<i>Niente</i>. There's not much we can do.

52:27.958 --> 52:30.583
I'm afraid the body is rigid.

52:30.666 --> 52:33.833
Well, he's always been rigid.
He's made of wood.

52:33.916 --> 52:36.708
Even if he's dead, I could still book him.

52:36.791 --> 52:39.041
How dare you, sir!

52:39.125 --> 52:40.708
Show some respect.

52:41.291 --> 52:45.208
You show respect to me
and my projected quarterly earnings!

52:45.291 --> 52:46.666
Gentlemen, please.

52:46.750 --> 52:49.291
This is no time for your petty grievances.

52:52.083 --> 52:54.250
How do you intend
to dispose of the dead body?

52:54.333 --> 52:56.041
-A dead body? Where?

52:57.291 --> 52:59.583
Pinocchio! You're alive!

52:59.666 --> 53:00.791
He is immortal!

53:00.875 --> 53:02.791
Long live the arts!

53:02.875 --> 53:05.041
It's a miracle.

53:07.458 --> 53:09.291
Take it easy, my child.

53:10.083 --> 53:11.166
Lean on me.

53:11.250 --> 53:13.041
We're going home.

53:13.125 --> 53:15.958
-Uh, uh, uh. Wait a moment.

53:16.041 --> 53:17.833
I have a legally binding contract.

53:18.500 --> 53:22.208
Signed by both artist and management.

53:23.166 --> 53:28.333
He either performs,
or you owe me ten million lire!

53:28.958 --> 53:30.333
Well, that's ridiculous.

53:30.416 --> 53:32.208
It's just a smiling sun.

53:32.291 --> 53:34.666
It's still his signature, is it not?

53:35.291 --> 53:36.375
I drew that.

53:36.458 --> 53:37.333
Ha ha!

53:37.833 --> 53:40.458
I demand full restitution before the law,

53:40.541 --> 53:44.250
including transportation,
transmutation, all the future represe--

53:44.333 --> 53:46.416
Our country comes first.

53:46.500 --> 53:48.208
This boy cannot be killed.

53:48.708 --> 53:50.291
-He's the ideal soldier.
-Hmm?

53:50.375 --> 53:53.333
He must be drafted
into the youth camps by law.

53:54.125 --> 53:55.875
You will learn to fight,

53:55.958 --> 53:59.083
and fire a weapon,
and be a real Italian boy.

53:59.166 --> 54:01.500
Now we… we must go.

54:01.583 --> 54:03.541
We truly must go.

54:03.625 --> 54:07.250
We will all speak later, I am sure.

54:07.333 --> 54:10.666
Not to me, sir. Speak to my lawyers!

54:11.958 --> 54:16.166
What… What a day. What a day!

54:16.250 --> 54:17.375
A fun day!

54:17.875 --> 54:19.458
What will we do?

54:19.541 --> 54:20.875
Oh, don't worry, Papa.

54:20.958 --> 54:23.333
I'll go to war. It sounds quite fun.

54:23.416 --> 54:27.166
I can learn to fight
and fire a weapon and march like the--

54:27.250 --> 54:28.750
No, Pinocchio.

54:28.833 --> 54:31.708
War is not fun!

54:31.791 --> 54:34.083
War is not good. War…

54:35.500 --> 54:38.750
War took Carlo away from me.

54:39.416 --> 54:40.708
Then I simply won't go.

54:40.791 --> 54:43.583
But you have to go now. It's the law.

54:43.666 --> 54:45.458
Even when it's something bad?

54:45.541 --> 54:50.541
Yes, we all have to obey the law
whether we like it or not.

54:51.041 --> 54:51.875
Why?

54:52.750 --> 54:57.416
I don't have time or patience enough
to explain that to you. I… I…

54:58.208 --> 55:00.791
I owe that man a fortune.

55:00.875 --> 55:07.208
And you… you will be taken far away
and recruited into military youth camp.

55:07.291 --> 55:10.958
And now… now look
what you've turned me into.

55:11.916 --> 55:14.833
I made you to be like Carlo.

55:14.916 --> 55:17.416
Why can't you be more like Carlo?

55:17.500 --> 55:19.250
Because I'm not Carlo.

55:19.333 --> 55:21.291
I don't wanna be like Carlo.

55:21.375 --> 55:22.833
-Carlo is--
-Enough!

55:24.875 --> 55:28.166
You are such a burden.

55:35.083 --> 55:35.958
Oh.

55:53.250 --> 55:55.125
His nose didn't grow.

55:56.375 --> 55:57.666
What's that?

55:57.750 --> 56:01.333
When he called me a burden,
his nose didn't grow.

56:02.791 --> 56:04.416
That's how he really feels.

56:06.291 --> 56:08.000
I don't want to be a burden.

56:08.833 --> 56:12.333
I don't want to hurt Papa
and make him want to yell at me like that.

56:13.541 --> 56:14.625
Oh, Pinocchio.

56:15.875 --> 56:19.750
Sometimes fathers feel despair
like everybody else.

56:20.333 --> 56:21.666
And they say things,

56:22.333 --> 56:25.166
things they only think they mean
in the moment.

56:25.833 --> 56:27.875
But with time, they learn that…

56:29.333 --> 56:31.625
well, that they
never really meant it at all.

56:33.166 --> 56:34.250
Do you understand?

56:39.666 --> 56:42.791
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

56:42.875 --> 56:44.541
I've got a plan.

56:44.625 --> 56:48.208
-Pinocchio, wha… what are you doing?
-You'll see!

56:48.291 --> 56:49.958
I'm going to the carnival.

56:50.791 --> 56:54.166
That way, I can help Papa,
and I won't go to war.

56:54.791 --> 56:57.250
I'll leave him a note
explaining everything.

56:59.166 --> 57:01.125
No, Pinocchio, don't do this.

57:02.916 --> 57:04.208
Oh, that's--

57:05.208 --> 57:06.708
No! No!

57:06.791 --> 57:07.708
Hmm.

57:08.583 --> 57:10.375
No! No, don't do this!

57:11.083 --> 57:13.625
You tell him that I will send him money.

57:14.541 --> 57:16.083
And tell him I love him.

57:16.875 --> 57:18.958
And I won't be a burden anymore.

57:23.625 --> 57:25.666
No!

57:51.041 --> 57:53.208
-Huh?

57:53.916 --> 57:55.416
-What is it?

57:55.500 --> 57:57.250
What do you want in the middle of the…

57:57.333 --> 57:59.958
My beloved star!

58:01.250 --> 58:03.583
How can I be of assistance?

58:04.250 --> 58:08.041
If I work for you, will you forget
the money you want from my papa?

58:08.625 --> 58:10.041
Huh?

58:10.750 --> 58:13.541
Oh, absolutely, my dear boy.

58:14.125 --> 58:17.291
And will you send him
my share of the profits?

58:17.375 --> 58:19.916
Clear accounting all the way.

58:20.666 --> 58:23.041
Fifty-fifty, right down the middle.

58:29.250 --> 58:31.791
-Oh.

58:31.875 --> 58:34.750
-Everybody up!

58:37.125 --> 58:38.833
We're leaving!

59:07.833 --> 59:08.708
Oh.

59:10.416 --> 59:11.791
The pain.

59:16.583 --> 59:18.958
Pinocchio. Son.

59:19.958 --> 59:22.125
I just wanted to say…

59:26.250 --> 59:27.208
Pinocchio!

59:35.166 --> 59:36.208
Oh!

59:37.291 --> 59:38.541
Little cricket.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.333
He's gone! To the carnival!

59:52.250 --> 59:53.375
Pinocchio!

59:55.750 --> 59:56.958
Pinocchio!

59:58.583 --> 59:59.708
Pinocchio!

1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:14.083
Get! Get!

1:00:16.375 --> 1:00:17.291
Oh.

1:00:19.500 --> 1:00:21.125
How will I ever find him?

1:00:21.833 --> 1:00:24.375
Oh, now you want to find him?

1:00:25.333 --> 1:00:28.833
After all the things you said.
After you called him a burden!

1:00:28.916 --> 1:00:30.166
A burden?!

1:00:30.875 --> 1:00:32.291
Why are you so blind?

1:00:32.375 --> 1:00:34.500
So absolutely blind!

1:00:34.583 --> 1:00:35.916
The boy loves you.

1:00:37.291 --> 1:00:41.125
He has much to learn,
but he loves you for who you are.

1:00:41.208 --> 1:00:43.708
Would it kill you to do as much for him?

1:00:43.791 --> 1:00:47.000
You should start acting like a father.
A real father!

1:00:47.083 --> 1:00:51.416
Not an old stubborn goat who's so busy
moaning and crying about his losses…

1:00:51.500 --> 1:00:54.041
"Me, me, me, poor me!"

1:00:54.125 --> 1:00:57.291
…that he cannot see
the love he actually has!

1:00:57.375 --> 1:00:59.625
I may be a bug, sir,

1:00:59.708 --> 1:01:01.958
but I have a thing or two
to teach you about…

1:01:02.041 --> 1:01:04.291
Hey! Where are you going?

1:01:04.375 --> 1:01:06.208
After my son!

1:01:06.291 --> 1:01:09.416
Excuse… If I may,
per… perhaps we should… Wait!

1:01:14.041 --> 1:01:16.125
-Wait! Wait! Wait!

1:03:01.666 --> 1:03:02.791
Ah!

1:04:38.041 --> 1:04:41.208
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

1:04:43.083 --> 1:04:46.250
<i>Viva Benito Mussolini, nostro duce!</i>

1:04:47.250 --> 1:04:50.875
<i>Viva! Viva! Viva!</i>

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.625
Just one last stop.

1:05:10.708 --> 1:05:14.375
Don't forget to send
my share of the money back home to Papa.

1:05:14.458 --> 1:05:16.750
Oh, I wouldn't dream of forgetting.

1:05:16.833 --> 1:05:19.125
See? Fifty-fifty…

1:05:20.625 --> 1:05:24.333
minus expenses,
transportation, and promotion.

1:05:25.125 --> 1:05:26.416
Huh?

1:05:26.500 --> 1:05:31.375
Tomorrow we go
to a small town by the sea. Catania.

1:05:32.958 --> 1:05:38.416
And there we will perform
for his excellency, <i>Il Duce.</i>

1:05:38.500 --> 1:05:40.083
<i>Il Dolce?</i>

1:05:40.166 --> 1:05:41.750
No, my brightest star.

1:05:41.833 --> 1:05:47.458
Our fearless leader,
<i>Il Duce</i>, Benito Mussolini!

1:05:48.083 --> 1:05:52.541
He heard of our act
and is coming to see us! Oh!

1:05:54.666 --> 1:05:56.875
He and I are very close.

1:05:58.291 --> 1:06:00.291
Here we are in Roma.

1:06:01.416 --> 1:06:02.875
That's him, back there.

1:06:03.916 --> 1:06:08.541
You will make me and your papa so proud.

1:06:08.625 --> 1:06:09.666
Proud.

1:06:13.875 --> 1:06:15.125
Excuse me, sir.

1:06:15.958 --> 1:06:19.333
Catania. Do you go there?

1:06:19.416 --> 1:06:21.375
Can… Can you take me there?

1:06:21.458 --> 1:06:22.625
Please?

1:06:22.708 --> 1:06:24.875
It's just across the strait.

1:06:26.208 --> 1:06:28.125
That's not the sea out there.

1:06:34.625 --> 1:06:36.750
-It's a graveyard!

1:06:36.833 --> 1:06:38.250
Oh dear… Oh…

1:06:38.333 --> 1:06:42.333
The dogfish, risen from the icy depths

1:06:42.416 --> 1:06:45.666
to take its tribute in blood and steel.

1:06:46.166 --> 1:06:50.166
A monster the size o' 20 ships,

1:06:50.250 --> 1:06:54.166
full of hunger and rage.

1:06:54.250 --> 1:06:57.791
Oh please. That's just children's stories.

1:06:57.875 --> 1:06:58.833
Captain,

1:07:00.041 --> 1:07:03.958
my son is on the other side of the gulf.

1:07:04.875 --> 1:07:07.750
He is performing tomorrow.

1:07:10.791 --> 1:07:13.000
This is all I have in the world.

1:07:13.083 --> 1:07:14.583
Take it. It's yours.

1:07:14.666 --> 1:07:17.083
I just want to see him again.

1:07:21.666 --> 1:07:25.041
-Step and turn. And step and turn.

1:07:25.125 --> 1:07:27.208
And look alive and step.

1:07:27.291 --> 1:07:30.166
-Step. Step.
-Can I take a moment to rest?

1:07:30.250 --> 1:07:33.041
No. Your tempo
is getting sloppier and sloppier.

1:07:33.125 --> 1:07:34.958
-No rest whatsoever.

1:07:39.041 --> 1:07:40.750
Five minutes, please.

1:07:42.958 --> 1:07:44.166
Three minutes.

1:07:45.375 --> 1:07:47.000
-Ooh.

1:07:53.583 --> 1:07:56.291
Are you feeling okay, Pinocchio?

1:07:56.375 --> 1:07:57.375
We're concerned.

1:07:57.458 --> 1:07:59.708
You look so tired and worn out.

1:07:59.791 --> 1:08:01.625
You need a good long rest.

1:08:01.708 --> 1:08:06.208
And some trousers and another ear
wouldn't hurt either if you ask me.

1:08:06.291 --> 1:08:08.708
Why not go home
and visit your papa for a while?

1:08:08.791 --> 1:08:10.500
This is no place for you.

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.041
I can't.

1:08:13.125 --> 1:08:16.958
I have to keep working
and working and sending money.

1:08:17.041 --> 1:08:17.875
Yeah…

1:08:17.958 --> 1:08:19.125
The truth is

1:08:19.625 --> 1:08:21.958
Count Volpe is using you.

1:08:23.375 --> 1:08:26.708
He hasn't sent a penny to your father.

1:08:26.791 --> 1:08:28.125
What?

1:08:28.208 --> 1:08:31.541
He keeps all the money for himself.

1:08:31.625 --> 1:08:33.125
He doesn't care about you.

1:08:33.208 --> 1:08:34.541
You're not his favorite.

1:08:34.625 --> 1:08:36.666
Spazzatura is his favorite.

1:08:36.750 --> 1:08:39.541
He's always been. He's a genius.

1:08:39.625 --> 1:08:42.250
No! Count Volpe wouldn't lie to me.

1:08:42.333 --> 1:08:43.875
I'm… I'm his star!

1:08:44.916 --> 1:08:46.750
You're… You're all just jealous!

1:08:50.625 --> 1:08:52.666
Ugh.

1:09:08.291 --> 1:09:11.083
You think we will find him, Sebastian?

1:09:11.916 --> 1:09:13.458
My Pinocchio?

1:09:14.333 --> 1:09:16.750
I do. You see…

1:09:29.708 --> 1:09:31.041
Arrivederci!

1:09:47.708 --> 1:09:49.541
Ha ha! It's me!

1:09:49.625 --> 1:09:51.458
-Look, here he comes!
It's him! It's him!

1:09:51.541 --> 1:09:55.375
-It's Pinocchio! Let me talk to him.
-Thank you. Oh, you're very kind.

1:09:55.458 --> 1:09:57.083
Not right now, I'm sorry.

1:09:59.333 --> 1:10:01.416
-You worthless…

1:10:01.500 --> 1:10:05.541
…mangy, deranged ape!

1:10:05.625 --> 1:10:06.625
Hmm?

1:10:08.166 --> 1:10:10.125
What have you been saying to him, huh?

1:10:10.208 --> 1:10:14.375
On the night before the big performance,
you could cost me everything!

1:10:14.916 --> 1:10:19.166
-You know who's coming? You have any idea?

1:10:19.250 --> 1:10:23.458
I found you
at the bottom of that cage in the rain.

1:10:23.541 --> 1:10:25.500
You were left there to die.

1:10:25.583 --> 1:10:28.416
Nobody wanted you, and I saved you.

1:10:28.500 --> 1:10:29.541
Rescued you!

1:10:30.041 --> 1:10:31.916
I should've let you die!

1:10:32.750 --> 1:10:34.666
Hey! Stop that!

1:10:34.750 --> 1:10:36.125
Don't hurt him anymore!

1:10:36.625 --> 1:10:41.208
This does not concern you, Pinocchio.
You're a star. Go rehearse your steps.

1:10:41.291 --> 1:10:42.916
I demand that you stop!

1:10:43.500 --> 1:10:45.916
You said it! I am the star of this show,

1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.541
and I won't have
my costar treated this way.

1:10:48.625 --> 1:10:52.083
And what's this I hear about
my papa not getting any money?

1:10:52.166 --> 1:10:54.833
I might just go home
right now and ask him.

1:10:54.916 --> 1:10:56.208
What do you think about that?

1:10:56.291 --> 1:10:59.208
You can perform for <i>Il Dolce</i> yourself.

1:11:01.750 --> 1:11:06.375
I think you misunderstand
our relationship, my little fire hazard.

1:11:07.083 --> 1:11:08.625
I am the puppeteer.

1:11:09.833 --> 1:11:11.625
-Uh!
-You are the puppet.

1:11:12.291 --> 1:11:14.416
I am the master.

1:11:14.500 --> 1:11:15.958
You are the slave!

1:11:16.041 --> 1:11:18.791
-And you will do as I command

1:11:18.875 --> 1:11:21.291
until your wooden body rots,

1:11:21.375 --> 1:11:23.750
and I use you to warm my furnace!

1:11:23.833 --> 1:11:25.416
-Oh.

1:11:25.500 --> 1:11:28.166
You may have no strings,

1:11:28.250 --> 1:11:30.375
but I control you.

1:11:30.458 --> 1:11:32.833
You obey me.

1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:36.583
Capisce?

1:11:37.750 --> 1:11:39.125
Spazzatura.

1:11:56.125 --> 1:11:59.291
A son knows when his father is alive.

1:11:59.916 --> 1:12:02.083
He will look for us, you'll see.

1:12:02.166 --> 1:12:04.500
-You have nothing to worry about.

1:12:04.583 --> 1:12:06.125
Easy for you to say.

1:12:09.333 --> 1:12:11.666
We are having dinner tonight.

1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:15.875
We're so lucky!

1:12:46.708 --> 1:12:49.583
Oh, Your Excellency!

1:12:49.666 --> 1:12:53.208
I wrote this number just for you.

1:12:54.166 --> 1:12:55.416
I like puppets.

1:12:58.750 --> 1:13:00.333
-Hey, Spazzatura.
-Hmm?

1:13:00.833 --> 1:13:04.375
You know, I think we ought to make
this big showstopper extra special

1:13:04.458 --> 1:13:07.208
for the all-important <i>Dolce</i> tonight.

1:13:07.291 --> 1:13:10.333
-Huh?
-I got some real good ideas.

1:13:11.125 --> 1:13:13.125
I think
that will definitely work.

1:13:16.166 --> 1:13:19.166
<i>In bocca al lupo, </i>my puppet.

1:13:19.250 --> 1:13:23.583
Delight the <i>Duce,</i>
and I will shower you with glory.

1:13:23.666 --> 1:13:27.625
Oh, we'll give him
a show he will never forget.

1:13:46.208 --> 1:13:48.708
-Poop?

1:13:48.791 --> 1:13:50.416
Yes. Poop, Your Excellency.

1:13:58.250 --> 1:14:01.958
-Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop!
-Ah!

1:14:20.916 --> 1:14:22.833
These puppets, I do not like.

1:14:23.666 --> 1:14:24.583
Shoot him!

1:14:26.541 --> 1:14:28.083
And burn it all down.

1:14:33.333 --> 1:14:35.000
Oh, hi! It's me!

1:14:35.083 --> 1:14:37.000
Ugh, it's him again.

1:14:37.083 --> 1:14:38.250
I cannot die!

1:14:38.333 --> 1:14:39.750
We know.

1:14:39.833 --> 1:14:42.000
-I can't die.

1:14:42.583 --> 1:14:44.083
I can't die!

1:14:44.875 --> 1:14:46.958
Through the door.

1:14:48.916 --> 1:14:50.291
Can you believe it?

1:14:50.375 --> 1:14:53.541
I've escaped war, bullets, fire…

1:14:53.625 --> 1:14:54.833
I was run over!

1:14:54.916 --> 1:14:57.541
I could get killed a lot!

1:14:57.625 --> 1:15:00.125
I'm the luckiest boy in the world.

1:15:00.208 --> 1:15:04.333
As I see it,
you were charged with a terrible burden.

1:15:04.416 --> 1:15:06.208
Huh? A burden?

1:15:06.916 --> 1:15:08.291
No, I'm not.

1:15:09.375 --> 1:15:12.083
That's a horrible thing to say to a boy.

1:15:12.958 --> 1:15:15.666
Life can bring great suffering.

1:15:16.416 --> 1:15:20.125
And eternal life
can bring eternal suffering.

1:15:21.500 --> 1:15:23.833
Aw, it's not so bad as all that.

1:15:23.916 --> 1:15:26.500
Yeah, I get a little beat up every time,

1:15:26.583 --> 1:15:29.333
but as soon as I get back,
I'm going home to my papa.

1:15:29.416 --> 1:15:35.583
Ah, but, Pinocchio,
what if you don't see your father again?

1:15:36.208 --> 1:15:37.291
Of course I will.

1:15:38.166 --> 1:15:39.666
Why wouldn't I?

1:15:39.750 --> 1:15:42.541
While you may have eternal life,

1:15:43.041 --> 1:15:47.500
your friends,
your loved ones, they do not.

1:15:48.083 --> 1:15:51.916
Every moment shared with them
may be the very last.

1:15:52.833 --> 1:15:57.333
You never know how long
you have with someone until they're gone.

1:15:57.416 --> 1:16:00.125
Huh? I… I don't understand.

1:16:00.833 --> 1:16:03.000
Can… Can you tell me more?

1:16:03.916 --> 1:16:07.875
Please? No! No! No!

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:15.041
Aha!

1:16:16.291 --> 1:16:19.166
I knew it! You came back to life.

1:16:21.500 --> 1:16:22.625
Hi, Candlewick.

1:16:23.208 --> 1:16:27.458
Most of us, we have but one life
to give for our fatherland, but you…

1:16:28.125 --> 1:16:30.125
you have no limit!

1:16:31.750 --> 1:16:33.333
-Me?
-Yes!

1:16:33.416 --> 1:16:34.333
You!

1:16:35.166 --> 1:16:40.125
Follow my orders, learn to obey,
and you will be the perfect soldier.

1:16:40.958 --> 1:16:42.750
But, my papa…

1:16:42.833 --> 1:16:44.666
You'll return home a hero.

1:16:44.750 --> 1:16:47.000
Any father would be proud of such a son.

1:16:49.125 --> 1:16:51.125
-We're here.

1:17:28.500 --> 1:17:29.875
Wow!

1:17:29.958 --> 1:17:31.416
What's all this?

1:17:31.500 --> 1:17:34.833
The Elite Military Project
for Special Patriotic Youth.

1:17:34.916 --> 1:17:36.958
-What's an elite?
-We are.

1:17:37.041 --> 1:17:39.875
We're gonna learn to be elite soldiers!

1:17:39.958 --> 1:17:41.750
Learn? Like school?

1:17:41.833 --> 1:17:46.541
To… To read and write
and do the <i>mulplitication</i> thingies?

1:17:47.666 --> 1:17:49.500
You're funny.

1:17:56.875 --> 1:17:57.875
Listen up.

1:17:58.416 --> 1:18:01.500
They're reporting
hostile planes in the area.

1:18:01.583 --> 1:18:06.291
But <i>we</i> will carry on
with the exercises tomorrow.

1:18:07.875 --> 1:18:09.958
Anyone here afraid of the enemy?

1:18:10.625 --> 1:18:12.583
-Uh-huh!
-No, sir!

1:18:14.250 --> 1:18:15.291
Mm-mm.

1:18:15.375 --> 1:18:16.625
Good.

1:18:16.708 --> 1:18:20.208
You may be boys,
but you have the hearts of men.

1:18:23.500 --> 1:18:26.958
Tomorrow, you train
for the glory of Italy!

1:18:27.041 --> 1:18:30.750
Tomorrow, you will
make your fatherland proud.

1:18:35.291 --> 1:18:37.166
Pinocchio. Pinocchio.

1:18:37.666 --> 1:18:38.583
Yeah?

1:18:39.166 --> 1:18:41.500
What do you think
my father meant about those planes?

1:18:41.583 --> 1:18:43.041
I don't know.

1:18:43.833 --> 1:18:47.000
I still don't really understand
what we're even doing here.

1:18:48.291 --> 1:18:51.500
We're preparing to be soldiers. For war.

1:18:51.583 --> 1:18:54.416
But my papa said war is bad.

1:18:54.500 --> 1:18:56.250
That's 'cause he's a coward.

1:18:56.333 --> 1:18:59.000
A coward? My papa?

1:18:59.083 --> 1:19:01.083
Well, he's afraid of war, isn't he?

1:19:01.166 --> 1:19:04.583
My father says if you're afraid to die
for your country, you're weak.

1:19:04.666 --> 1:19:05.708
You're a coward.

1:19:05.791 --> 1:19:07.208
Are you afraid?

1:19:07.291 --> 1:19:08.375
I'm not afraid at all.

1:19:08.458 --> 1:19:11.333
Well, neither am I. Or my papa.

1:19:11.416 --> 1:19:13.375
-I love war.
-I love it more!

1:19:13.458 --> 1:19:16.916
I love it twenty-four seven,
every day and anytime!

1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:20.458
-So do I!
-Well, we'll see about that, won't we?

1:19:25.041 --> 1:19:26.583
I'll show him I'm no coward.

1:19:27.083 --> 1:19:28.333
I'll make him like me.

1:19:30.500 --> 1:19:34.833
You know,
all fathers love their sons, but…

1:19:36.291 --> 1:19:41.625
sometimes fathers feel despair,
like everyone else.

1:19:41.708 --> 1:19:45.208
And they say things
they only think they mean in the moment.

1:19:46.916 --> 1:19:51.500
But with time, they learn
they never really meant it at all.

1:19:52.625 --> 1:19:58.791
And they may even call you ugly things
like a burden or a coward,

1:19:59.375 --> 1:20:00.583
but inside…

1:20:02.458 --> 1:20:03.708
they love you.

1:20:08.083 --> 1:20:09.166
Are you scared?

1:20:10.458 --> 1:20:11.500
Of dying?

1:20:12.333 --> 1:20:14.666
Me? Nah.

1:20:14.750 --> 1:20:16.250
I died a couple times.

1:20:16.333 --> 1:20:17.333
It was all right.

1:20:17.833 --> 1:20:22.666
There's rabbits and card games
and a lot of sand.

1:20:23.291 --> 1:20:24.708
Blue sand.

1:20:26.083 --> 1:20:27.333
You're so weird.

1:20:27.416 --> 1:20:29.708
No weirder than you, pal!

1:20:38.041 --> 1:20:40.166
I'm… I'm glad you're here.

1:20:43.583 --> 1:20:44.583
Me too.

1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.125
And as with all great empires,

1:20:51.625 --> 1:20:54.625
the destiny of Italy will be forged

1:20:54.708 --> 1:20:56.666
in the strength of its youth.

1:20:57.791 --> 1:21:02.083
Today, you'll get your first taste of war.

1:21:03.166 --> 1:21:04.791
You'll form two teams.

1:21:05.791 --> 1:21:08.958
In the center of the battlefield
is a tower.

1:21:09.666 --> 1:21:16.000
The first team to place their flag
at the top of the tower wins.

1:21:16.500 --> 1:21:17.791
And remember,

1:21:18.541 --> 1:21:21.083
no matter who is on the other team,

1:21:21.166 --> 1:21:23.250
they are your enemy.

1:21:25.333 --> 1:21:26.708
May the best man win

1:21:26.791 --> 1:21:31.208
and bring glory to his team
and honor to us all.

1:21:34.750 --> 1:21:36.750
Rifles are loaded with paint.

1:21:37.708 --> 1:21:39.791
And the grenades, confetti.

1:21:39.875 --> 1:21:41.875
-Mark your kill, boys.

1:21:42.541 --> 1:21:44.041
-For Italia!

1:21:44.125 --> 1:21:45.750
-Hey!

1:21:45.833 --> 1:21:47.958
-Watch it!

1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:50.250
W-- Wait!

1:22:16.208 --> 1:22:18.458
Come on, boys! Let's go!

1:22:24.125 --> 1:22:26.000
-Go! Go!
-Charge!

1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:30.208
-Watch out!
-Oh!

1:22:36.541 --> 1:22:38.333
Faster! Follow me!

1:22:56.208 --> 1:22:57.166
Take this.

1:24:00.916 --> 1:24:03.000
You're both here. Why?

1:24:03.916 --> 1:24:06.250
We both won, Father!

1:24:06.875 --> 1:24:09.250
Oh. Is that so?

1:24:10.250 --> 1:24:13.583
And how did you come
to that conclusion, may I ask?

1:24:13.666 --> 1:24:15.166
It was a tie.

1:24:16.375 --> 1:24:18.166
We both climbed up fast.

1:24:19.625 --> 1:24:20.791
Very good, then.

1:24:22.541 --> 1:24:23.583
Candlewick…

1:24:26.541 --> 1:24:27.583
…shoot the puppet.

1:24:35.416 --> 1:24:36.916
But, Father…

1:24:41.083 --> 1:24:43.375
this is a real gun.

1:24:45.166 --> 1:24:46.916
Take your glory, son!

1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:48.583
Shoot the puppet!

1:24:50.250 --> 1:24:53.000
<i>Take your positions on the parapets.</i>

1:24:54.333 --> 1:24:55.791
<i>Defend the center.</i>

1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:58.791
<i>For Italy!</i>

1:25:01.500 --> 1:25:03.125
We are under attack!

1:25:03.208 --> 1:25:05.833
I told you to shoot the puppet!

1:25:05.916 --> 1:25:08.458
No! I will not let you do this!

1:25:12.458 --> 1:25:15.166
All my life, Father,
just trying to please you.

1:25:16.625 --> 1:25:17.833
But I never will!

1:25:18.541 --> 1:25:19.375
You were right.

1:25:19.458 --> 1:25:23.791
I'm thin and weak and flimsy,
just like the wick of a candle.

1:25:23.875 --> 1:25:24.875
Always afraid.

1:25:25.375 --> 1:25:29.208
But even then, with all the fear I feel,
I can say no to you.

1:25:29.750 --> 1:25:31.250
-I can do that.

1:25:31.750 --> 1:25:34.750
I'm not afraid to say no. Are you?

1:25:35.541 --> 1:25:37.125
You filthy coward!

1:25:39.208 --> 1:25:41.041
Yes, you are weak!

1:25:41.916 --> 1:25:44.541
You are no son of mine!

1:25:46.125 --> 1:25:47.250
Candlewick!

1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:49.875
Puppet!

1:25:51.166 --> 1:25:52.458
On your feet.

1:25:57.708 --> 1:25:59.458
Time for the final lesson.

1:26:06.083 --> 1:26:07.000
Now,

1:26:07.583 --> 1:26:10.958
you will know what it is
to truly serve the fatherland!

1:26:11.791 --> 1:26:13.041
Ah!

1:26:38.625 --> 1:26:42.041
Ah! Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

1:26:55.708 --> 1:26:57.791
Hello, my little rebel.

1:26:58.875 --> 1:27:01.083
I've found you at last.

1:27:01.875 --> 1:27:03.541
I lost everything.

1:27:04.458 --> 1:27:05.916
And now you will too.

1:27:13.166 --> 1:27:15.583
-Huh?

1:27:15.666 --> 1:27:17.125
Candlewick!

1:27:17.208 --> 1:27:19.583
<i>Bonjour, mon étoile.</i>

1:27:19.666 --> 1:27:22.291
No! Where's Candlewick?

1:27:22.833 --> 1:27:26.125
Spazzatura! Please! Help me!

1:27:27.916 --> 1:27:30.708
I'm all he has in this world,
the poor thing.

1:27:30.791 --> 1:27:32.708
I have forgiven him.

1:27:32.791 --> 1:27:36.416
-But you! You squandered everything!

1:27:41.583 --> 1:27:43.583
Give me that torch, Spazzatura!

1:27:44.958 --> 1:27:46.166
Spazzatura!

1:27:47.333 --> 1:27:50.666
-Ah! Give me that, you mangy ape!

1:27:50.750 --> 1:27:51.958
Let me go!

1:27:53.291 --> 1:27:55.875
Is our contract worth nothing?

1:27:56.416 --> 1:27:58.208
I'll do my part,

1:27:58.291 --> 1:28:00.541
and you, you will burn.

1:28:01.083 --> 1:28:02.166
Burn bright!

1:28:02.666 --> 1:28:04.125
Like a star!

1:28:06.416 --> 1:28:07.958
Hey, that's hot!

1:28:08.041 --> 1:28:09.291
Worse than chocolate!

1:28:09.375 --> 1:28:11.333
-Ow! Ow!

1:28:11.416 --> 1:28:12.416
Help!

1:28:13.875 --> 1:28:15.083
Please! Help!

1:28:15.166 --> 1:28:17.625
-Help! Ow!

1:28:17.708 --> 1:28:18.625
Help!

1:28:19.708 --> 1:28:20.916
-Ah!

1:28:26.875 --> 1:28:28.208
Whoa!

1:28:29.208 --> 1:28:32.208
How could you do this to me?

1:28:32.291 --> 1:28:33.750
And for a puppet?

1:28:33.833 --> 1:28:37.291
You loathsome <i>lusus naturae</i>!

1:28:40.166 --> 1:28:43.625
You will betray me no more!

1:29:16.333 --> 1:29:18.208
Spazzatura!

1:29:40.416 --> 1:29:41.708
Spazzatura.

1:29:42.958 --> 1:29:45.041
Will I ever see my papa again?

1:29:45.125 --> 1:29:47.416
-Huh?

1:29:51.041 --> 1:29:51.875
Huh?

1:29:59.791 --> 1:30:02.791
Look! An island!

1:30:18.458 --> 1:30:22.250
-Swim!

1:30:27.958 --> 1:30:28.875
Whoa!

1:30:46.750 --> 1:30:47.708
Huh?

1:30:54.291 --> 1:30:55.125
Huh?

1:30:59.083 --> 1:31:00.041
Ugh.

1:31:18.666 --> 1:31:21.458
Papa? Papa!

1:31:33.166 --> 1:31:34.125
Papa!

1:31:35.125 --> 1:31:37.041
-You're alive!

1:31:40.250 --> 1:31:41.583
Pinocchio!

1:31:42.916 --> 1:31:44.708
Oh.

1:31:44.791 --> 1:31:46.833
-My Pinocchio.

1:31:51.041 --> 1:31:52.083
Love hurts.

1:32:01.791 --> 1:32:03.708
You'll be okay, Papa.

1:32:03.791 --> 1:32:07.791
After you're feeling better,
we'll go right home. Okay?

1:32:08.666 --> 1:32:10.291
No, Pinocchio, no.

1:32:11.375 --> 1:32:14.125
There's no escape from this dreaded beast.

1:32:15.083 --> 1:32:20.375
He comes seeking the warmth of the sun
every decade or so.

1:32:21.750 --> 1:32:24.916
It will soon sink back to the depths

1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:29.125
of the darkest, coldest ocean
where it dwells,

1:32:29.208 --> 1:32:32.875
and it will drag us with him.

1:32:33.500 --> 1:32:35.958
Oh my God! This is it!

1:32:36.875 --> 1:32:39.291
-Follow me!

1:32:40.041 --> 1:32:41.083
Follow you? Where?

1:32:41.166 --> 1:32:44.166
Up to the lighthouse and freedom!

1:32:58.000 --> 1:33:01.583
The blow holes!
We can climb out through them!

1:33:01.666 --> 1:33:04.833
But we… we'll never reach it.
It's… It's too far!

1:33:05.583 --> 1:33:06.916
Pinocchio can help!

1:33:08.541 --> 1:33:09.625
Pinocchio, look.

1:33:09.708 --> 1:33:11.875
Listen. Listen.
Okay, we have to climb…

1:33:13.458 --> 1:33:15.291
What is it, Pinocchio?

1:33:17.208 --> 1:33:19.166
Oh, Papa, I hate you!

1:33:19.250 --> 1:33:21.083
What? Well, what do you--

1:33:21.166 --> 1:33:25.750
And I hate you too, Spazzatura.
And you, Sebastian J. Cricket!

1:33:27.583 --> 1:33:32.666
Yes, I see!
Just this once, lie, m'boy!

1:33:32.750 --> 1:33:34.166
Yes, that's it! Lie!

1:33:34.250 --> 1:33:36.166
My name is Panucchio!

1:33:36.250 --> 1:33:37.500
More, Pinocchio!

1:33:37.583 --> 1:33:39.583
I love the smell of onions!

1:33:39.666 --> 1:33:41.333
I love… I love war!

1:33:43.083 --> 1:33:46.083
I wanna be trapped here
forever and ever and ever!

1:33:46.583 --> 1:33:48.166
That's it!

1:33:49.791 --> 1:33:51.916
Climb now! Everybody, climb!

1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:53.916
Hurry! Come on!

1:33:56.625 --> 1:33:58.291
-What are you--

1:33:58.375 --> 1:33:59.208
Oh.

1:33:59.875 --> 1:34:02.416
Oh. Now steady on… Whoa!

1:34:11.875 --> 1:34:14.708
Oh. Oh. Oh my word. Oh dear.

1:34:18.416 --> 1:34:20.500
Whoa. Hold it. Whoa.

1:34:29.416 --> 1:34:30.250
That's it!

1:34:32.583 --> 1:34:35.375
Don't look down, Pinocchio!

1:34:37.250 --> 1:34:38.291
Look at me!

1:34:39.208 --> 1:34:40.791
-Look at your papa!

1:34:40.875 --> 1:34:42.250
Ah!

1:34:46.625 --> 1:34:48.208
He's going to sneeze! Hurry!

1:35:00.833 --> 1:35:01.875
Ah!

1:35:01.958 --> 1:35:03.750
No! No! Ah!

1:35:03.833 --> 1:35:05.166
I've got you, son.

1:35:07.958 --> 1:35:09.791
-Hold on, my boy!

1:35:09.875 --> 1:35:12.208
-Ah!
-Help! Help!

1:35:53.958 --> 1:35:55.208
Ah.

1:36:07.166 --> 1:36:08.500
Uh-oh.

1:36:08.583 --> 1:36:09.458
Whoa!

1:36:18.125 --> 1:36:21.166
-Oh no! Pinocchio!

1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:37.083
Papa!

1:36:38.041 --> 1:36:39.708
Papa!

1:36:46.875 --> 1:36:48.833
It's coming for us! Quick!

1:37:01.958 --> 1:37:04.541
Come on, Spazzatura. You can do it!

1:37:26.083 --> 1:37:27.125
Ah!

1:37:27.208 --> 1:37:29.541
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1:37:31.291 --> 1:37:33.250
Yes, faster, Spazzatura!

1:37:33.833 --> 1:37:35.166
Hold on!

1:37:42.458 --> 1:37:43.291
Ah!

1:38:15.416 --> 1:38:17.875
No, not now!

1:38:21.541 --> 1:38:24.208
Send me back now! Please!

1:38:25.291 --> 1:38:27.916
I need to go back to save my papa.

1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:29.958
You know the rules, Pinocchio.

1:38:30.791 --> 1:38:34.541
All the sand must fall
before you can return.

1:38:35.250 --> 1:38:37.875
There's no time! He's dying!

1:38:37.958 --> 1:38:40.000
Rules are rules,

1:38:40.083 --> 1:38:41.666
and if we break them,

1:38:43.166 --> 1:38:45.583
there are dire consequences.

1:38:46.166 --> 1:38:49.416
If you were to go back now, so soon,

1:38:49.500 --> 1:38:51.208
you would become mortal.

1:38:53.958 --> 1:38:55.500
You might save Geppetto,

1:38:56.625 --> 1:38:58.791
but you will die, Pinocchio,

1:38:59.666 --> 1:39:02.250
and it will be your last life.

1:39:04.541 --> 1:39:06.208
I don't care!

1:39:06.291 --> 1:39:07.458
Send me back!

1:39:09.875 --> 1:39:10.791
Do it!

1:39:11.333 --> 1:39:13.291
Not me, wooden boy.

1:39:14.333 --> 1:39:17.250
Break the rules. Break them.

1:39:18.291 --> 1:39:19.750
If you're sure.

1:39:34.291 --> 1:39:37.083
Now, go to your father, child.

1:39:39.458 --> 1:39:41.250
And make the most of it.

1:40:26.041 --> 1:40:27.750
Ah!

1:41:02.291 --> 1:41:04.500
We made it!

1:41:05.708 --> 1:41:07.000
I can't believe it!

1:41:07.916 --> 1:41:10.583
Ah.

1:41:28.208 --> 1:41:29.375
Pinocchio.

1:41:33.541 --> 1:41:36.000
My boy. My boy.

1:41:39.333 --> 1:41:41.125
Wake up, Pinocchio.

1:41:43.166 --> 1:41:44.375
Like last time!

1:41:45.625 --> 1:41:46.458
Get up!

1:41:48.208 --> 1:41:49.708
You're fine. You… You…

1:41:57.416 --> 1:41:58.541
You are here.

1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:01.041
My dear son.

1:42:02.208 --> 1:42:03.291
Can't you see me?

1:42:04.958 --> 1:42:06.541
You're… You're alive.

1:42:07.625 --> 1:42:09.291
You're so free. I…

1:42:11.166 --> 1:42:12.541
I need you.

1:42:14.125 --> 1:42:16.416
Son.

1:42:45.041 --> 1:42:46.375
Master Geppetto.

1:42:50.625 --> 1:42:53.541
I only wished to bring you joy.

1:42:55.416 --> 1:42:56.458
And you did.

1:42:57.958 --> 1:42:59.541
You did bring me joy.

1:43:00.333 --> 1:43:04.541
Such terrible, terrible joy.

1:43:07.166 --> 1:43:10.291
Please, bring him back to me.

1:43:11.750 --> 1:43:14.875
To save you,
he became a real boy.

1:43:16.166 --> 1:43:19.416
And real boys don't come back.

1:43:21.625 --> 1:43:22.750
I know that.

1:43:24.583 --> 1:43:26.375
I know! But…

1:43:28.958 --> 1:43:30.291
It's not fair!

1:43:33.125 --> 1:43:35.833
In this world,
you get what you give, remember?

1:43:35.916 --> 1:43:37.250
And this boy gave…

1:43:37.958 --> 1:43:40.125
Well, he gave everything he could!

1:43:42.458 --> 1:43:47.041
You said if I should perform my duties
and make Pinocchio a good boy,

1:43:47.125 --> 1:43:50.625
guide him into doing what is right,
you would concede me one wish.

1:43:52.166 --> 1:43:53.083
I did.

1:43:53.958 --> 1:43:56.375
And did you accomplish this task?

1:43:56.458 --> 1:43:59.625
Okay! Fine. So maybe I didn't do so great.

1:43:59.708 --> 1:44:01.958
Maybe I messed up a little or… a lot,

1:44:02.041 --> 1:44:06.916
but, well, I tried my best,
and that's the best anyone can do.

1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:08.458
Pinocchio taught me that.

1:44:09.125 --> 1:44:12.333
I mean, I taught it to him,
and then he taught it straight back at me.

1:44:12.416 --> 1:44:13.833
And you know why? Because…

1:44:15.375 --> 1:44:16.833
Because he was good.

1:44:25.583 --> 1:44:28.208
Well, then, noble cricket,

1:44:29.166 --> 1:44:30.750
choose wisely.

1:44:32.166 --> 1:44:33.916
Well, gosh darn it!

1:44:34.708 --> 1:44:36.333
I wish him back to life!

1:44:38.291 --> 1:44:39.666
Very well, then.

1:44:45.916 --> 1:44:48.625
Little wooden boy made of pine,

1:44:49.500 --> 1:44:51.416
may you rise with the sun

1:44:53.291 --> 1:44:55.166
and wander the earth.

1:44:56.166 --> 1:44:57.375
Be his son.

1:44:58.375 --> 1:45:00.708
Fill his days with light…

1:45:09.625 --> 1:45:12.166
…so he'll never be alone.

1:45:17.541 --> 1:45:18.750
Pinocchio.

1:45:20.250 --> 1:45:21.916
My child.

1:45:23.958 --> 1:45:27.500
I was trying
to make you someone you were not.

1:45:28.458 --> 1:45:33.708
So don't be Carlo or anyone else.

1:45:33.791 --> 1:45:36.375
Be exactly who you are.

1:45:38.500 --> 1:45:39.333
I…

1:45:40.791 --> 1:45:41.833
I love you

1:45:43.125 --> 1:45:44.833
exactly as you are.

1:45:52.416 --> 1:45:54.583
Then I will be Pinocchio.

1:45:55.833 --> 1:45:57.666
And you will be my papa.

1:45:58.250 --> 1:45:59.583
Will that do?

1:46:01.083 --> 1:46:03.125
That will do.

1:46:34.083 --> 1:46:35.250
Aw.

1:46:35.333 --> 1:46:36.166
Oh.

1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:39.166
Life is such a wonderful gift.

1:46:55.125 --> 1:46:58.125
<i>And so it was</i>
<i>that we lived our lives.</i>

1:47:02.375 --> 1:47:03.666
-Checkmate!

1:47:05.625 --> 1:47:07.875
<i>We never saw</i>
<i>the wood sprite again.</i>

1:47:12.458 --> 1:47:13.833
<i>Geppetto aged.</i>

1:47:14.958 --> 1:47:16.291
<i>Pinocchio didn't.</i>

1:47:19.083 --> 1:47:22.416
<i>And in time, Geppetto left.</i>

1:47:30.500 --> 1:47:33.916
<i>One winter morning,</i>
<i>Pinocchio found me by the window.</i>

1:47:34.958 --> 1:47:36.458
<i>I wasn't moving anymore.</i>

1:47:37.041 --> 1:47:42.250
<i>So he put me in a matchbox,</i>
<i>and he carries me still with him.</i>

1:47:45.166 --> 1:47:46.416
<i>Right in his heart.</i>

1:48:15.875 --> 1:48:17.791
<i>He ventured into the world.</i>

1:48:17.875 --> 1:48:21.416
<i>And the world,</i>
<i>I believe, embraced him back.</i>

1:48:23.458 --> 1:48:25.500
<i>I've not heard of him in quite a while.</i>

1:48:26.916 --> 1:48:28.375
<i>Will he eventually die?</i>

1:48:29.666 --> 1:48:30.666
<i>I think so.</i>

1:48:31.541 --> 1:48:33.625
<i>And maybe that makes him a real boy.</i>

1:48:34.791 --> 1:48:37.208
<i>What happens, happens.</i>

1:48:38.125 --> 1:48:41.000
<i>And then, we are gone.</i>

1:49:03.125 --> 1:49:05.833
Are you gonna keep yappin',
or are you gonna play?

1:49:05.916 --> 1:49:07.291
Do you mind?

1:49:07.791 --> 1:49:09.708
I was recounting my life!

1:49:09.791 --> 1:49:11.291
It was a good life!

1:49:11.375 --> 1:49:13.083
Ah, good enough.

1:49:15.625 --> 1:49:17.083
Hit it, boys!
