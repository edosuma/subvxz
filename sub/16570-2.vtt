00:08.090 --> 00:12.289
The video was taken last night
by our surveillance cameras at LAX.

00:13.963 --> 00:17.865
And the star of our little film
is this man here...

00:18.034 --> 00:20.594
...former real-estate mogul
Allan Summers.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.767
Now, Mr. Summers
has a lot of problems.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.311
For example,
he's being investigated by the FBI...

00:31.481 --> 00:33.779
...for fraud and embezzlement.

00:34.484 --> 00:36.509
Selling houses he didn't build...

00:36.686 --> 00:40.554
...and building houses he couldn't connect
to power or water supplies.

00:40.724 --> 00:42.385
Since this scheme was uncovered...

00:42.559 --> 00:45.289
...it's had a fairly negative effect
on Summers' finances.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.397
In addition to spending a fortune
keeping himself out of jail...

00:48.565 --> 00:52.365
...he was forced to abandon his latest
residential real-estate development.

00:53.103 --> 00:55.469
And since his company went belly-up...

00:55.638 --> 00:58.129
...his partners are taking him to court...

00:58.308 --> 01:01.835
...and his employees are suing him
for their lost pensions.

01:08.251 --> 01:11.243
Now, just when it seemed like
things could not get worse...

01:11.421 --> 01:14.913
...Mr. Summers flew into LAX
from Sacramento last night...

01:15.091 --> 01:18.720
...was met at Arrivals
by a driver from his usual car service.

01:21.564 --> 01:25.227
And somewhere
between the airport and his home...

01:25.401 --> 01:29.064
...both Mr. Summers and the chauffeur
completely disappeared.

01:31.474 --> 01:34.705
Stop, Buzz.
Can you zoom in on that card, please?

01:41.918 --> 01:47.550
So Allan Summers and his driver
have only been gone for 12 hours...

01:47.724 --> 01:50.625
...not even long enough
to generate a missing-persons report.

01:50.794 --> 01:51.818
So why are we here?

01:51.995 --> 01:54.964
At 8:00 this morning,
Summers' wife and son went to the bank...

01:55.131 --> 01:58.294
...and told the manager
that he was being held for ransom.

01:58.468 --> 02:05.465
$1,190,476.19, to be exact.

02:05.642 --> 02:07.439
Right. Which no one could give them.

02:07.610 --> 02:09.874
Summers' assets
have been frozen by the FBI.

02:10.045 --> 02:11.536
The son then told the manager...

02:11.714 --> 02:15.616
...the kidnapper had promised to kill
Summers if the police were notified, so...

02:15.785 --> 02:18.049
The bank manager called
our Fraud section.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.384
And fraud called in
Detective Mikki Mendoza here...

02:21.558 --> 02:25.824
...to put together this airport footage
in an attempt to verify Mrs. Summers' story.

02:25.995 --> 02:30.762
So Allan Summers
is the target of both an FBI investigation...

02:30.934 --> 02:34.199
...and a multimillion-dollar lawsuit,
and suddenly he goes missing?

02:34.370 --> 02:36.338
Isn't it more likely
he just skipped town?

02:36.506 --> 02:39.373
But you haven't even finished
watching the video, ma'am.

02:39.542 --> 02:41.703
Excuse me. One second.

02:41.878 --> 02:45.507
Uh, have we spoken
to the Summers' family yet?

02:46.883 --> 02:48.680
Look, Chief Johnson,
if Mrs. Summers' story is true...

02:48.852 --> 02:50.820
...then her husband could be
in imminent danger.

02:50.987 --> 02:54.184
And let's not forget about the driver, and...
Is that your cat?

02:54.624 --> 02:56.319
Yes. Sorry. Um...

02:56.492 --> 02:58.756
She either has to be with me
or at the vet.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.919
- What's her name?
- Kitty.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.156
She's sick today.
I need to give her a shot.

03:04.534 --> 03:05.967
So, uh, there's more video?

03:06.502 --> 03:09.027
- Buzz.
- Hold on.

03:09.205 --> 03:14.199
Yes, I have some footage from
the exit of the short-term parking lot.

03:15.044 --> 03:18.536
One second. Okay, that's it.

03:23.353 --> 03:27.949
You see, that's the vehicle registered
to the car service Summers hired.

03:31.461 --> 03:35.557
Allan Summers was met by a chauffeur,
but he drove himself away from the airport.

03:35.732 --> 03:37.199
That's hardly ever a good thing.

03:37.367 --> 03:39.358
It doesn't prove
that Summers was kidnapped.

03:39.535 --> 03:41.662
The whole thing could have been staged.

03:41.838 --> 03:43.601
And where's the driver?

03:44.140 --> 03:45.903
Speaking of whom, Detective Sanchez?

03:46.075 --> 03:48.373
Mario Gomez.
DMV says he's 50 years old.

03:48.544 --> 03:50.739
No criminal record.

03:52.115 --> 03:53.241
Thank you.

03:55.218 --> 03:59.518
Oh, yeah, uh, Detective Mikki Mendoza,
this is Detective Sanchez.

04:00.757 --> 04:02.918
And this is Lieutenant Tao.

04:03.259 --> 04:04.920
And you've already met Kitty.

04:06.229 --> 04:09.926
And thank you, lieutenant.
Sergeant David Gabriel. Hi.

04:10.366 --> 04:12.926
Uh, Chief,
according to the driver's boss...

04:13.102 --> 04:16.161
...Gomez has been working
for the car service for about six months.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.399
This was the first time he was assigned
to pick Mr. Summers up.

04:19.575 --> 04:22.567
He didn't return his car
and he's not answering his cell phone.

04:22.745 --> 04:25.236
So both Mr. Summers and his driver
are still missing.

04:25.415 --> 04:27.076
If this is a genuine kidnapping...

04:27.250 --> 04:29.775
...then Mr. Gomez, the driver,
must be involved.

04:30.420 --> 04:32.945
But is he the suspect or the victim?

04:33.723 --> 04:35.884
Good morning, everyone. Heh, heh.

04:36.059 --> 04:39.290
- Morning?
- Lieutenant Provenza, it's 12:30 p.m.

04:39.462 --> 04:43.865
Well, my apologies.
I assure you it couldn't be helped. Ha, ha.

04:44.033 --> 04:47.696
Hey, hello, Mikki.
You staying out of trouble, sweetie pie?

04:47.870 --> 04:49.963
- Better than you are, sir.
- Attagirl.

04:50.373 --> 04:54.036
Okay, kiddos, what'd I miss?

04:54.210 --> 04:55.609
Lieutenant.

04:55.778 --> 04:57.837
Yeah. Uh, okay.

04:58.014 --> 05:01.472
This crooked real-estate guy,
Allan Summers...

05:01.651 --> 05:04.950
...was picked up at LAX last night
in a town car...

05:05.121 --> 05:07.419
...and no one has seen him since.

05:07.590 --> 05:10.218
Summers is being investigated
for fraud by the FBI...

05:10.393 --> 05:12.156
...so he could have just run away.

05:12.328 --> 05:14.922
But, uh, his family seems to think
that he was kidnapped.

05:15.098 --> 05:17.259
They want access
to his frozen bank accounts...

05:17.433 --> 05:19.663
...so they can pay this weird ransom.

05:19.836 --> 05:22.771
On the other hand,
they could be faking the whole thing.

05:22.939 --> 05:23.963
It's very confusing.

05:24.607 --> 05:27.132
Huh. So where's the chauffeur?

05:27.310 --> 05:31.406
At the moment,
we can't find Mr. Gomez or his car.

05:31.581 --> 05:35.813
Uh, chief, I got, uh, Gomez's home address
from his boss.

05:35.985 --> 05:39.819
Also, the name of one of his regular fares,
a Katherine Ortega.

05:39.989 --> 05:42.014
He's been picking her up for five months.

05:42.191 --> 05:44.682
She was the one who phoned
when he didn't show today.

05:44.861 --> 05:46.328
Thank you, sergeant.

05:46.496 --> 05:50.523
And, Detective Mendoza, I'm assuming
y'all put out this missing car's plates?

05:51.334 --> 05:53.268
We did. No one's seen it yet.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.837
The kidnapper would have gotten rid
of the car pretty quickly.

05:57.006 --> 05:59.702
Probably somewhere near the airport.

06:00.510 --> 06:02.637
Lieutenant Provenza,
I really need that car...

06:02.812 --> 06:05.542
...and you seem
to be awfully frisky this afternoon.

06:05.715 --> 06:07.012
Well, yes, I am.

06:07.183 --> 06:11.552
And, chief, this is perfect weather
to organize a grid search for a town car.

06:11.721 --> 06:15.885
And I could really go for a nice long walk
around LAX. It'd be good for me.

06:16.559 --> 06:18.493
Okay, do we have
a Breathalyzer up here?

06:18.661 --> 06:21.596
Uh, thank you.
A grid search would be very helpful.

06:21.764 --> 06:22.856
You got it.

06:23.032 --> 06:26.229
Uh, Lieutenant Tao, I assume
we have the driver's cell number.

06:26.402 --> 06:29.064
Hmm, I'll try pinging it.
Maybe I can triangulate his position.

06:29.238 --> 06:32.867
Thank you. Chief Pope, I think
now is a good time to bring the family in...

06:33.042 --> 06:36.478
No. No way. You are to stay
arm's length from the family.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.547
If this turns out to be another
one of Allan Summers' frauds...

06:39.715 --> 06:41.546
...his wife and son could be involved.

06:41.717 --> 06:44.413
And if it's not, you could wind up
getting Summers killed.

06:44.854 --> 06:48.551
Look for the driver, but we have to assume
this is a legitimate kidnapping.

06:48.724 --> 06:51.454
If I can't interview potential suspects...

06:51.627 --> 06:54.687
...and given that this kidnapping
is partially a financial crime...

06:54.864 --> 06:57.492
...can we agree
that I need a forensic accountant...

06:57.667 --> 07:01.068
...to go over the Summers' finances?
- Chief.

07:01.237 --> 07:04.206
I think I could follow
the Summers' money trail...

07:04.373 --> 07:07.308
...if the FBI
would just share their files with me.

07:10.446 --> 07:12.505
All right, sergeant. Do the best you can.

07:12.949 --> 07:15.941
And, Detective Mendoza,
since y'all are so thorough...

07:16.119 --> 07:19.782
...some of your people can keep an eye
on missing chauffeur's residence...

07:19.956 --> 07:21.218
...in case he shows up.

07:21.390 --> 07:23.858
We'd be more than happy
to help in any way we can.

07:24.026 --> 07:27.120
Come on, Tao. I'll drive.

07:27.296 --> 07:28.456
- Chief.
- Yes?

07:29.065 --> 07:32.796
Provenza is wearing a brand-new tie.
It's brand-new.

07:33.369 --> 07:34.927
Something to investigate later.

07:35.104 --> 07:37.664
In the meantime,
if you and Detective Sanchez here...

07:37.840 --> 07:39.740
...could help Detective Mendoza?

07:39.909 --> 07:44.903
And, sergeant, have you located
our missing chauffeur's regular fare yet?

07:45.982 --> 07:49.042
You just told me to have the FBI
help with the money trail.

07:49.218 --> 07:53.052
What would you prefer,
me to contact Katherine Ortega or the FBI?

07:53.222 --> 07:55.918
What's the matter?
You can't do two things at once?

08:00.696 --> 08:02.630
Two things at once.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:12.375 --> 08:15.242
Hi, Ms. Ortega.
Sergeant Gabriel from the L.A.P.D.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.504
I was calling regarding Mr. Gomez.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.238
<i>So Mario's still missing?</i>

08:19.415 --> 08:21.383
Well, here's the good news,
Ms. Ortega:

08:21.551 --> 08:24.520
You know Mario,
so you can help us in our search.

08:25.888 --> 08:27.879
Mario was driving you to work
every night...

08:28.057 --> 08:30.457
...and picking you up in the morning,
is that right?

08:30.626 --> 08:32.957
Goodness. What kind of job
keeps you out all night?

08:33.129 --> 08:37.361
Oh, data entry at a law firm.
It's not very exciting.

08:37.533 --> 08:39.125
Data entry, huh?

08:40.369 --> 08:44.703
- So y'all didn't talk too much about work?
- No, ha, ha. No.

08:44.874 --> 08:50.176
Did Mario mention any family members,
a wife or a girlfriend, maybe?

08:51.414 --> 08:52.881
No.

08:53.249 --> 08:57.515
He was married,
but, uh, his wife died last year.

08:57.687 --> 08:59.052
Of cancer, I think.

09:00.556 --> 09:06.358
Um, I think that's why he's a driver now.
He needed to quit his job, um, be her nurse.

09:06.529 --> 09:09.794
She needed 24-hour care.
They didn't have insurance.

09:10.233 --> 09:13.794
And after his wife passed away,
he couldn't get his old job back...

09:13.970 --> 09:16.598
...so that's why he came to L.A.

09:16.772 --> 09:20.401
So you said that Mario came to L.A.
From where?

09:22.345 --> 09:23.403
Um...

09:23.946 --> 09:26.881
Look, you're my only link
to Mario Gomez.

09:27.049 --> 09:29.574
If you're not straight with me,
and I mean right now...

09:30.586 --> 09:32.178
...I might never find him.

09:32.355 --> 09:34.653
Every second you delay
could be risking his life.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.655
Okay.

09:37.360 --> 09:40.761
He was an illegal.
I hate that word, but he was an illegal.

09:41.197 --> 09:44.325
He thought someone had been following
him home to his apartment every night.

09:45.701 --> 09:47.259
I begged him to call the police.

09:48.104 --> 09:51.301
He said he didn't wanna go back
to Mexico.

09:52.341 --> 09:55.777
Look, I should have called you myself.

09:56.479 --> 09:58.276
Mario begged me not to.

10:02.385 --> 10:06.412
Mario Gomez's social security number
belongs to a guy who died two years ago.

10:06.589 --> 10:09.649
- The girl's right, he's probably an illegal.
- A lot of police here.

10:09.825 --> 10:12.658
Judge might wonder why we need
this many for a welfare check.

10:12.828 --> 10:16.161
I'll say it's because I'm concerned
about Mario's welfare. And I am.

10:16.332 --> 10:18.061
Detective.

10:21.637 --> 10:24.071
- Never mind. I'll just pick the lock.
- Step aside.

10:24.507 --> 10:26.634
No! Oh!

10:26.809 --> 10:29.471
Detective Mendoza,
you are jumping the gun.

10:29.645 --> 10:31.306
Front's clear. Checking the back.

10:31.714 --> 10:32.942
I only needed a second.

10:38.287 --> 10:42.451
There's no pictures of his wife.
There's nothing personal here at all.

10:42.625 --> 10:46.288
When you sneak across the border,
you don't get to bring a moving van, chief.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.797
Looks like he was planning
on being home after his airport run.

10:49.965 --> 10:53.230
Chief. Bedroom's clear.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.927
Found some fresh blood
on this towel from the bathroom.

10:56.105 --> 10:57.470
Maybe he cut himself shaving?

10:57.640 --> 10:59.335
Well, that was kind of him.

10:59.508 --> 11:01.908
Let's have SID check it
for DNA and blood type.

11:03.279 --> 11:05.907
I wonder if Gomez knew
who was after him.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.411
Yes, Lieutenant Provenza?

11:32.475 --> 11:33.999
Found it 90 minutes in.

11:35.811 --> 11:38.644
The driver's cell phone
was thrown under the car.

11:39.515 --> 11:41.312
This isn't pretty, chief.

11:48.357 --> 11:50.621
How did this happen?

11:51.460 --> 11:52.950
No casings anywhere.

11:53.896 --> 11:55.887
This close, it was probably a knife.

11:59.735 --> 12:01.066
Or a hatchet.

12:01.237 --> 12:04.502
No one loses this much blood and lives.
No one.

12:04.673 --> 12:07.540
Where's the body? Or bodies?

12:11.180 --> 12:14.843
How did they disappear
without leaving a trail?

12:18.387 --> 12:20.321
Who died?

12:22.691 --> 12:25.660
Lieutenant Tao,
I need you to examine this blood spatter.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.490
Let's find out exactly
what happened here.

12:30.232 --> 12:33.861
Well, one thing's for sure,
it's not just a kidnapping anymore.

12:35.070 --> 12:36.662
No.

12:37.573 --> 12:39.564
Now it's a murder.

12:43.779 --> 12:47.408
There, there, Kitty.
I'll just put you right here.

12:47.583 --> 12:51.110
Okay, Kitty. Please don't move.

12:51.287 --> 12:55.485
I'll try not to hurt you this time.
I promise. Okay?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.166
Uh, oops!

13:04.967 --> 13:06.366
- I'll come back.
- Oh, no.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.560
Will, come in. Come in. You can help me.

13:08.737 --> 13:10.432
Uh...

13:11.640 --> 13:13.232
Okay.

13:13.409 --> 13:14.876
Thanks. Um...

13:16.679 --> 13:19.239
He doesn't like it,
but he won't scratch.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.073
Good.

13:22.952 --> 13:25.750
- You do all this every day?
- Twice.

13:25.921 --> 13:31.416
Um, Kitty's kidneys haven't been
doing too well, so, uh...

13:31.594 --> 13:36.031
...the, uh, vet has her on fluids
and this experimental-drug therapy.

13:36.198 --> 13:39.395
So Kitty has to get shots twice a day.
He can't be left alone.

13:39.568 --> 13:40.592
Um...

13:40.769 --> 13:45.934
Ahem, on the, uh, Summers case,
we seem to have blood but no body...

13:46.108 --> 13:49.737
...a car but no driver,
and a ransom but no money to pay it.

13:49.912 --> 13:53.780
Is there any chance you've figured out
who murdered whom?

13:53.949 --> 13:58.886
Well, uh, according to Mario's regular fare,
Mario was afraid for his life.

14:00.222 --> 14:05.023
And we typed the blood in the town car
to the blood on the towel in his apartment.

14:05.194 --> 14:07.958
- Both O-negative.
- Universal victim.

14:08.464 --> 14:09.761
But, uh, so...

14:12.635 --> 14:14.432
So the blood could also belong...

14:16.171 --> 14:18.036
...to Allan Summers.

14:18.774 --> 14:23.108
And in order to, um,
check it against his medical records...

14:23.279 --> 14:24.974
...I need to contact the family.

14:25.614 --> 14:28.105
- We cannot directly contact the family.
- Oh.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.411
Look, this kidnapper, whoever he is...

14:30.586 --> 14:33.384
...has made it clear
that he has no problem killing people.

14:33.556 --> 14:36.150
So I'm tending
to take his threats seriously.

14:36.325 --> 14:39.852
But in order to rule the family out
completely as suspects...

14:40.029 --> 14:43.157
You may not bring the Summers in.
You may not go to them.

14:43.332 --> 14:45.732
No contact by phone or e-mail.

14:45.901 --> 14:49.337
Now, unless you can find some other way
to talk to them, that is off the table.

14:50.940 --> 14:53.773
There, there, Kitty. There, there.

14:54.510 --> 14:56.478
I need to understand
the Summers' finances.

14:56.645 --> 15:00.103
The amount of the ransom is so ridiculous
that it must mean something.

15:00.516 --> 15:05.954
I just don't think that Sergeant Gabriel
is up to the task of figuring that out.

15:06.121 --> 15:09.022
But as far as the forensic accounting
you're looking for...

15:09.191 --> 15:11.659
...the FBI must already have that.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.661
Do you think Fritz could get a copy
of those files to Sergeant Gabriel?

15:15.831 --> 15:17.093
Fritz and I have decided...

15:17.266 --> 15:20.394
...we're keeping our personal
and professional life separate.

15:20.569 --> 15:23.697
Because the FBI hates me so much.

15:24.640 --> 15:28.872
Well, there's still one or two people at the
Bureau that'll still return my calls, so...

15:29.044 --> 15:33.344
I'll just... I'll take care of that.
I'll see if I can finesse that for us.

15:35.651 --> 15:36.675
Thank you, Will.

15:39.521 --> 15:41.819
Oh, hey.

15:41.991 --> 15:44.050
- Hey, Fritz. How are things?
- Good.

15:44.226 --> 15:48.458
- You?
- Uh, good, good. I'm just helping with Kitty.

15:49.098 --> 15:52.556
- Well, thanks for that.
- Sure.

15:52.735 --> 15:55.033
Uh, all right. Good to see you.

15:55.204 --> 15:58.901
And I'll get back to you.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.337
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:03.512 --> 16:05.275
How's the patient?

16:05.447 --> 16:08.575
Kitty looks good today.
A little more energy.

16:08.751 --> 16:10.742
You think?

16:11.186 --> 16:14.246
I'm gonna get her on home.
You're gonna be here a while, I take it.

16:14.423 --> 16:18.257
Yes. I need to contact the family
without contacting them...

16:18.427 --> 16:21.453
...and interview them
without interviewing them.

16:21.630 --> 16:23.564
That kind of thing.

16:23.732 --> 16:26.166
I can tell you the FBI is feeling
stupid right now.

16:26.335 --> 16:30.669
We have taps on all of Summers' phones
and we were monitoring his credit cards.

16:30.839 --> 16:36.778
And to have him kidnapped like this
is bad, awful, horrible, and crappy for us.

16:36.945 --> 16:39.277
We're thrilled
not to be officially involved...

16:39.448 --> 16:42.906
...but if we can help you
behind the scenes...

16:43.085 --> 16:46.577
No. I don't want you talking with the FBI
on my behalf.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.347
- We decided.
- All right.

16:49.358 --> 16:51.121
All right.

16:53.028 --> 16:56.486
Bye, Kitty. Bye-bye. Bye.

16:57.666 --> 17:03.298
I mean, what would they say, anyway,
behind the scenes?

17:05.107 --> 17:09.806
Hmm... Well, they would probably say...

17:09.978 --> 17:11.969
...give the family
the money for the ransom.

17:13.182 --> 17:15.912
In fact, if you could get
proof of life on Summers...

17:16.085 --> 17:18.986
...the FBI would unfreeze his accounts.

17:20.055 --> 17:24.252
Then you could put tracer bills in the cash
that the Summers withdraw...

17:24.425 --> 17:27.589
...follow the transmitters,
let the ransom lead you to kidnappers...

17:27.762 --> 17:30.698
...or to Summers himself,
if this is another one of his frauds.

17:30.866 --> 17:33.835
Best thing about all of that,
since you'd be running the case...

17:34.002 --> 17:36.232
...is you keep total control
over the money.

17:38.340 --> 17:41.673
So I'd be like a bank.

17:45.347 --> 17:47.281
Remember to eat.

17:48.283 --> 17:51.514
Bye. Bye, Kitty. Bye-bye.

18:03.499 --> 18:08.732
<i>Chief, Mrs. Summers
and her son are coming into the bank.</i>

18:27.790 --> 18:30.725
Excuse me. I'm Mary Summers
and this is my son, Adam.

18:30.893 --> 18:34.920
Mr. Elkins called to say that you were
the person to see about our problem.

18:35.097 --> 18:38.328
Yes, ma'am. Have a seat, Mrs. Summers.

18:38.500 --> 18:42.698
We just need to clarify a few issues
before we execute the transaction.

18:42.871 --> 18:44.634
Anything.

18:44.807 --> 18:48.709
Um, this is the man who picked your
husband up from the airport.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.209
His name is Mario Gomez,
works for a car service.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.405
- You ever seen him before?
- What?

18:53.582 --> 18:55.914
- Why would we know the chauffeurs?
- Oh, God.

18:56.084 --> 18:57.415
Don't "Oh, God" me, Adam.

18:57.586 --> 19:00.077
We're grateful for your help,
but we have a deadline.

19:00.255 --> 19:02.519
Why does the bank care
about who was driving?

19:02.691 --> 19:06.491
Well, unfortunately, Mrs. Summers,
your assets have been frozen by the FBI.

19:06.662 --> 19:09.426
They just won't release them
because we ask them to.

19:09.598 --> 19:12.931
Listen to me.
There's over $5 million in that account.

19:13.101 --> 19:15.729
That's all the money Allan and I have
left in the world.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.099
There's no place else
to go for this ransom.

19:18.273 --> 19:22.573
You have to release the funds.
You just said you would. Please.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.672
Here's the problem, Mrs. Summers.

19:25.848 --> 19:29.409
Your husband has been involved
in some dodgy business ventures of late.

19:29.585 --> 19:33.612
He might be faking this kidnapping
in order to get money from the bank.

19:33.789 --> 19:38.123
What? Who are you
to make these accusations?

19:38.894 --> 19:40.953
Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson
of L.A.P.D.

19:41.129 --> 19:42.687
This is Sergeant David Gabriel.

19:42.865 --> 19:46.460
Now wait a minute, wait a minute.
We were told "no police."

19:46.635 --> 19:48.728
- That's no longer possible.
- They'll kill him.

19:48.904 --> 19:50.769
Which is why,
before we pay the ransom...

19:50.939 --> 19:53.772
...we have to make sure
that your husband is still alive.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.137
And we need your help with that.

19:58.881 --> 20:01.475
How? What can we do?

20:01.650 --> 20:03.777
Oh, for starters,
what's your father's blood type?

20:04.386 --> 20:06.047
It's A-positive, same as me.

20:06.989 --> 20:10.823
That's good for your father.
That's not so good for Mr. Gomez.

20:10.993 --> 20:13.621
- Who?
- The driver. The guy who picked up Dad.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.992
The death of a chauffeur may be
beneath your notice, Mrs. Summers...

20:17.165 --> 20:18.564
...but it's not beneath mine.

20:22.437 --> 20:25.929
Apparently, Mr. Gomez was murdered
during the abduction of your husband.

20:26.108 --> 20:29.805
And a criminal who kills once
will most likely do it again.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.343
You mentioned a deadline?

20:32.047 --> 20:34.572
The kidnapper's calling us back
at 8:00 tonight.

20:34.750 --> 20:38.345
Once he knows we can get the money,
he'll give us more instructions.

20:38.854 --> 20:39.980
Mrs. Summers...

20:40.155 --> 20:43.124
...your husband has been
under a lot of pressure lately...

20:43.292 --> 20:46.227
...with investigations and lawsuits.

20:46.395 --> 20:48.454
Is it possible he just ran away?

20:49.364 --> 20:53.300
I can't believe he would leave us
like that.

20:53.468 --> 20:56.062
We couldn't believe it
when he sold homes to people...

20:56.238 --> 20:58.297
...without securing water rights.
- Stop it.

20:58.473 --> 21:01.670
Lost everything his partners gave him,
the employee pension fund...

21:01.843 --> 21:03.140
...our whole company.

21:03.312 --> 21:06.110
That sounds like he'd have
a lot of people to run away from.

21:06.281 --> 21:08.044
A million dollars would give him...

21:08.216 --> 21:11.982
Wouldn't begin to cover what my father
would want to start a new life.

21:12.154 --> 21:15.146
In fact, it's the relatively small amount
of the ransom...

21:15.324 --> 21:19.055
...that makes me believe that my father
is in a life-threatening situation.

21:19.661 --> 21:23.495
So we're back to the original question.
What do you need from us?

21:23.999 --> 21:25.762
When the kidnapper calls tonight...

21:25.934 --> 21:28.732
...I want you to ask him
to put your father on the phone.

21:29.137 --> 21:31.503
And with your permission,
we'll be listening in.

21:31.673 --> 21:34.608
Once we have proof of life,
the FBI will unfreeze your money.

21:34.776 --> 21:36.676
You can pick it up here in the morning.

21:36.845 --> 21:38.437
And then what?

21:39.715 --> 21:42.912
I'll try to make sure your husband
doesn't end up like Mario Gomez.

21:44.853 --> 21:48.084
Ms. Johnson, I suppose we have no choice
but to do what you ask...

21:48.256 --> 21:53.421
...even though you have done nothing
but frighten us and insult us.

21:54.296 --> 21:58.096
- If anything happens to my husband...
- Thank you so much for your cooperation.

21:58.266 --> 22:00.393
And you can go to hell.

22:15.283 --> 22:18.150
Okay, Sanchez is posted with
Mendoza and SIS.

22:18.320 --> 22:20.117
They're sitting on the Summers house.

22:20.288 --> 22:23.587
We're also linked into the tap
of their home phones over here.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.659
- Sergeant Gabriel, are you ready?
- I am.

22:25.827 --> 22:27.988
The FBI,
who I have on hold right now...

22:28.163 --> 22:31.098
...gave me a direct line
into Summers' account and his password.

22:31.266 --> 22:34.258
The moment we have proof of life,
they'll unfreeze the account.

22:34.436 --> 22:35.926
There's over $5 million here.

22:36.104 --> 22:38.595
And the kidnappers only want
a little over 1 million.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.675
If Summers was behind this,
don't you think he'd take it all?

22:41.843 --> 22:44.539
Maybe he wanted
to leave something behind, for his wife.

22:44.713 --> 22:46.271
You haven't met her.

22:46.815 --> 22:48.282
You haven't met her.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.714
- Watch every penny, sergeant.
- I am.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.951
Check it out, chief.

22:53.121 --> 22:57.114
Electronic tracers buried inside.
They look real, huh?

22:57.559 --> 23:00.995
Throw these in a stack of bills,
they'll lead us right to the bad guy.

23:01.163 --> 23:04.155
So the Summers withdraw the cash
tomorrow from the bank...

23:04.332 --> 23:06.960
...and then we follow the money
until we find our victim.

23:07.135 --> 23:08.397
The Summers' phone is ringing.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.740
Eight o'clock on the dot.

23:16.445 --> 23:18.310
<i>- Hello?
- Do you have the money?</i>

23:18.480 --> 23:20.880
<i>I need to speak to my husband.</i>

23:21.049 --> 23:24.212
<i>Do you have the money?
Did you get access to the account?</i>

23:24.386 --> 23:28.117
<i>- I have to know Allan's okay first.
- Hold on.</i>

23:29.591 --> 23:31.286
<i>Mary? Mary, are you there?</i>

23:31.460 --> 23:34.156
<i>Oh, Allan. Oh, God. Are you all right?</i>

23:34.329 --> 23:36.229
<i>- Darling, I'm fine.
- Oh, Allan.</i>

23:36.998 --> 23:38.522
<i>Mary, everything's gonna be okay.</i>

23:38.700 --> 23:40.930
<i>We worked out a very good way
of handling this.</i>

23:41.103 --> 23:44.038
<i>Follow this man's instructions
and I'll be home tomorrow night.</i>

23:44.206 --> 23:48.336
<i>I love you. I love Adam.
I love you both so much.</i>

23:48.510 --> 23:50.569
<i>- Wait, Allan.
- All right, proof of life.</i>

23:50.745 --> 23:52.474
Yes, sir. Thank you.

23:52.647 --> 23:57.175
Okay, I am unfreezing the account.

23:59.988 --> 24:02.616
<i>I want the money
in two heavy-duty garbage bags...</i>

24:02.791 --> 24:03.883
<i>...noon tomorrow.</i>

24:04.059 --> 24:07.324
<i>Drop the bags in the trash can
on the corner of 5th and Grand.</i>

24:07.496 --> 24:09.862
<i>Come alone. No cops.</i>

24:10.031 --> 24:12.625
<i>- Do not bring your cell phone. Understand?
- Yes.</i>

24:12.801 --> 24:14.996
<i>If you fail to follow these instructions...</i>

24:15.170 --> 24:18.628
<i>...your husband ends up like the guy
who picked him up from the airport.</i>

24:21.042 --> 24:23.875
<i>Ugh. The call's untraceable, chief.</i>

24:24.045 --> 24:28.072
Okay, um, we need to notify
Mario Gomez's next of kin.

24:28.250 --> 24:30.582
Probably in Mexico somewhere.

24:30.752 --> 24:34.188
We don't even know if that's his real name.
Could you get on that, please?

24:34.356 --> 24:36.824
- Chief, Mrs. Summers is on the phone.
- Uh, one second.

24:36.992 --> 24:40.860
Commander, uh, let's have SIS
continue watching the Summers...

24:41.029 --> 24:43.361
...and put some extra units
on tomorrow's drop.

24:43.532 --> 24:47.992
- Call Detective Sanchez...
- Oh, no, no... Come on.

24:48.170 --> 24:50.866
- What is it, sergeant?
- The Summers' money, it's gone.

24:51.039 --> 24:52.904
- What do you mean?
- Just this second.

24:53.074 --> 24:56.043
I turned back to listen to you.
When I looked back down...

24:56.211 --> 24:58.577
...the balance had gone down by...
- How much?

24:58.747 --> 25:00.044
Hold on. Checking.

25:04.452 --> 25:10.413
- $1,190,476.
- And 19 cents.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.423
Chief, I am so sorry.

25:16.498 --> 25:18.398
<i>Well, it's not as bad as it looks.</i>

25:18.567 --> 25:20.432
What are you talking about?
The driver is dead.

25:20.602 --> 25:23.230
The kidnapper tricked us
into giving him the ransom.

25:23.405 --> 25:25.930
Or worse yet,
Summers planned this whole thing...

25:26.107 --> 25:28.234
...and we helped him
steal over $1 million.

25:28.410 --> 25:31.811
The FBI's gonna be upset when I ask them
to find where this money went.

25:31.980 --> 25:34.073
That's if they ever
actually answer the phone.

25:34.249 --> 25:37.776
It's the FBI's fault. They were supposed
to be keeping tabs on Summers.

25:38.486 --> 25:40.351
They gave us permission
to unfreeze the account.

25:41.723 --> 25:43.156
Come in.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.616
- Ah.
- Yes, what is it, sergeant?

25:46.494 --> 25:52.524
I, uh, ahem, I traced the bank transfer and I
found out where Summers' money is going.

25:52.701 --> 25:55.727
- Did you get a name?
- Of a country.

25:55.904 --> 25:58.464
- The ransom's off to the Cayman Islands.
- Oh!

25:58.640 --> 26:01.803
From there, it can be sent anywhere
without being traced. Great.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.308
But the good news here...

26:03.478 --> 26:07.642
...is that the money won't be credited
to the Cayman Islands' account until 7 a.m.

26:07.816 --> 26:10.444
So we still have a few hours
to figure this thing out.

26:10.852 --> 26:13.753
Did FBI give you a copy
of the Summers fraud investigation yet?

26:13.922 --> 26:16.447
- No.
- Well, they need to hurry those files along.

26:16.625 --> 26:18.923
I wanna understand
the amount of ransom.

26:19.094 --> 26:22.860
It can't be random.
It must mean something.

26:23.331 --> 26:25.697
Sergeant. Here.

26:25.867 --> 26:29.303
Congratulations.
You're now officially on hold with the FBI.

26:29.471 --> 26:31.666
Good luck getting them to hurry.

26:32.674 --> 26:37.634
Look, I just wanna say that I'm, uh, really
sorry about losing the money.

26:37.812 --> 26:42.681
Maybe Detective Daniels
could have done a better job.

26:43.184 --> 26:44.412
I don't know about that.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.488
It was a protected account.

26:47.656 --> 26:49.851
Allan Summers
was the only other person...

26:50.025 --> 26:53.586
...besides the bank and the FBI
to even have that password.

26:53.762 --> 26:55.821
Summers knows a great deal about finance.

26:55.997 --> 26:58.932
Maybe, but he doesn't know
the first thing about blood spatter.

26:59.100 --> 27:02.035
- Lieutenant Tao?
- Behind the murder board, chief.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.270
I figured out
what happened in Gomez's town car.

27:07.442 --> 27:09.672
Is this my desk?

27:09.844 --> 27:14.474
The driver's throat was slashed here,
spurting arterial blood.

27:14.649 --> 27:18.983
Then the victim leapt over these two rows
to here.

27:19.154 --> 27:23.318
He then flew over the headrest...

27:23.491 --> 27:26.051
...and shot himself in the head
with a vanishing bullet.

27:26.227 --> 27:28.388
You're saying
the crime scene was staged?

27:28.563 --> 27:31.464
The blood couldn't have come
from any series of wounds.

27:31.933 --> 27:35.869
And there are no smear marks
anywhere inside the car.

27:36.037 --> 27:40.030
And the body wasn't dragged out of it.
No blood outside the car, not one drop.

27:41.209 --> 27:42.699
So, what do you think happened?

27:43.411 --> 27:47.472
My opinion, the blood
was brought to the car in a container...

27:47.882 --> 27:49.747
...and splashed inside.

27:50.318 --> 27:53.481
Though where anybody got
this much of it at once is beyond me.

27:55.990 --> 27:57.582
Mario's regular fare said...

27:57.759 --> 28:00.489
...that when Mario's wife got sick,
he became her nurse.

28:00.662 --> 28:02.857
And nurses know how to draw blood.

28:03.665 --> 28:07.658
But this would have taken
a lot of elaborate planning, chief.

28:07.836 --> 28:09.565
Mario Gomez would have to know...

28:09.738 --> 28:13.572
...he needed this much blood
weeks before the kidnapping.

28:14.075 --> 28:18.978
And he also would had to have known
Allan Summers.

28:23.785 --> 28:26.049
Okay, stop, Buzz.

28:26.221 --> 28:28.553
Play it back
from when we first see Allan Summers.

28:28.723 --> 28:30.953
- And slow it down this time.
- Oh, sure.

28:40.068 --> 28:43.037
Okay, freeze it. You see that, lieutenant?

28:43.204 --> 28:45.331
The other drivers
are holding up name cards...

28:45.507 --> 28:47.099
...before the passengers come out.

28:47.275 --> 28:50.711
But Mario doesn't lift his
until he sees Allan Summers.

28:50.879 --> 28:53.939
But according to his boss,
Mario never drove Allan Summers before.

28:54.115 --> 28:57.209
Summers didn't know Mario,
but Mario certainly knew him.

28:57.385 --> 28:59.910
- So it's not a murder anymore.
- No.

29:00.088 --> 29:03.455
Now it's a kidnapping, again.

29:08.396 --> 29:11.422
So this illegal immigrant
took a job as a driver...

29:11.599 --> 29:14.830
...then kidnapped Allan Summers
first chance he got...

29:15.270 --> 29:16.669
...then staged his own death?

29:16.838 --> 29:20.934
After which, he executed an international
money-laundering scheme.

29:21.109 --> 29:24.636
It's the amount of the ransom
that makes no sense. If I understood that...

29:24.813 --> 29:28.146
Chief, I got the FBI's case file
on Allan Summers.

29:28.316 --> 29:32.480
- Oh, finally.
- Finally. And I've been doing a little math.

29:33.087 --> 29:38.389
Now, Summers' employees
were suing him for $300 million.

29:38.560 --> 29:42.792
Subtract $100 million that they agreed
to pay their attorneys if they won.

29:42.964 --> 29:47.799
- Lawyers.
- And that leaves us with $200 million.

29:47.969 --> 29:51.166
Now, there were 168 litigants.

29:51.339 --> 29:56.834
If they won their case, each employee
would have received a payoff of...

29:57.011 --> 30:02.972
...$1,190,476.19.

30:03.151 --> 30:05.346
Maybe somebody
didn't trust the courts.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.712
Excellent work, sergeant.

30:09.257 --> 30:11.817
Do you have the names and addresses
of these employees?

30:11.993 --> 30:14.484
Everyone who's worked
for Summers' properties.

30:14.662 --> 30:16.493
We only have hours to find the victim.

30:16.664 --> 30:18.996
Look through your file.
Find me a Latino man...

30:19.167 --> 30:21.829
...who knows about money,
might have lost his wife...

30:22.003 --> 30:24.198
...and who looks like this.

30:42.924 --> 30:47.861
Mario Gomez is actually Mario Vargas,
born and raised in Los Angeles.

30:48.296 --> 30:52.164
Spent the last 20 years as a risk analyst
for Allan Summers' company.

30:52.333 --> 30:56.895
He lost everything in the collapse.
His house here is being repossessed.

30:57.071 --> 30:59.733
If this is Vargas' real house,
what about the apartment?

30:59.908 --> 31:02.672
All part of the fake identity
he established.

31:02.844 --> 31:06.974
The driver's license he bought, the extra
cell phone he dumped at the town car.

31:07.148 --> 31:09.878
Like pretending to be an illegal
afraid for his life...

31:10.051 --> 31:12.747
...with the girl
he drove back and forth to work.

31:12.921 --> 31:17.790
Vargas does all that so he can get a job
as a driver and kidnap Summers?

31:18.293 --> 31:21.592
His wife apparently
died of cancer recently.

31:22.430 --> 31:24.557
Maybe he was looking
for someone to blame.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.327
Nice tie you got there.

31:29.170 --> 31:30.694
Really?

31:30.939 --> 31:32.304
Well, ha, ha...

31:33.074 --> 31:34.701
...thanks.

31:35.376 --> 31:38.470
Yeah, thanks.
Uh, what are you looking for?

31:40.548 --> 31:44.143
Vargas has 15 photographs
of this house in his kitchen.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.684
Yeah?

31:46.254 --> 31:49.690
Hmm. Looks, uh, looks new.

31:49.857 --> 31:52.655
- No address?
- No.

31:52.827 --> 31:55.387
Trying to find something
that might tell us where it is.

31:55.563 --> 31:57.360
Well, good.

31:59.367 --> 32:00.561
What's with you?

32:00.735 --> 32:04.034
Uh, haven't slept in two days.

32:04.205 --> 32:07.663
Back is sore. My neck is stiff.

32:09.077 --> 32:11.045
I hurt in places I forgot I had.

32:12.614 --> 32:14.514
- You're seeing someone.
- What?

32:14.682 --> 32:17.446
- Admit it. You're dating.
- Mind your own business, huh.

32:17.619 --> 32:20.144
Why don't you go find out
where this house is...

32:20.321 --> 32:22.619
...while I catch my second wind?

32:27.762 --> 32:29.457
And stop staring at my tie.

32:31.032 --> 32:34.365
So we mobilize the entire L.A.P.D.
to find Summers...

32:34.535 --> 32:37.595
...pick up this Vargas guy,
and neither one of them is here.

32:37.772 --> 32:39.535
Vargas is coming back.

32:39.707 --> 32:43.108
Mendoza has eight SIS vehicles
on the lookout for his car.

32:43.778 --> 32:46.076
How do we know
for sure he's coming back?

32:46.347 --> 32:49.976
The Cayman Islands' account
probably posted the ransom an hour ago.

32:50.151 --> 32:53.609
- Where's he headed?
- Mexico City.

32:53.788 --> 32:57.781
And then someplace
without an extradition treaty, I imagine.

33:20.748 --> 33:22.113
Chief.

33:27.822 --> 33:29.483
In taking care of his wife...

33:29.657 --> 33:35.391
...Mr. Vargas probably became
quite proficient with a hypodermic.

33:41.636 --> 33:44.070
You do get better as you go along.

33:45.073 --> 33:47.633
He could have been drawing
his own blood for months.

33:49.310 --> 33:52.006
Saving up enough
to throw around inside that car.

33:52.814 --> 33:56.306
<i>Subject vehicle is coming
around the exit point now.</i>

33:56.751 --> 34:00.448
Chief, I found a current cell-phone bill
for Mario Vargas.

34:00.621 --> 34:01.781
I have Mikki on the line.

34:01.956 --> 34:04.686
SIS made Vargas' car.
It's coming this way.

34:04.859 --> 34:06.224
No passenger onboard.

34:07.628 --> 34:10.927
If Vargas drives up now
and sees us here, he's not gonna stop.

34:11.099 --> 34:14.226
- Tell Mikki we're going with Plan B.
- Plan B? Yes.

34:14.402 --> 34:18.202
Mikki, go with Plan B.
I repeat, go with Plan B.

34:24.746 --> 34:25.770
Hello?

34:25.947 --> 34:28.074
- Mario Vargas?
- Yeah. Who's this?

34:28.248 --> 34:31.411
This is deputy chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson of the L.A.P.D.

34:31.585 --> 34:34.248
We were hoping you could
come to Parker Center today...

34:34.422 --> 34:35.911
...our headquarters downtown...

34:36.090 --> 34:38.422
...and help us with a little problem
we're having.

34:38.860 --> 34:40.760
And what problem is that?

34:40.928 --> 34:43.362
I understand
you used to work for Allan Summers.

34:43.531 --> 34:46.989
Yeah, a year ago.
His company went bankrupt.

34:47.168 --> 34:51.103
We may have found where Mr. Summers
was storing a whole bunch of extra cash.

34:51.272 --> 34:53.831
We were hoping
that you and his other employees...

34:54.007 --> 34:55.270
...could help us find it.

34:56.610 --> 34:58.442
I wouldn't be much use in that regard.

34:58.613 --> 35:02.105
I only analyzed the data as Mr. Summers
sent it down to our department.

35:02.283 --> 35:05.309
And it was all lies.
I really had no idea what he was doing.

35:05.486 --> 35:09.252
If it's more convenient, I could stop by
your place, save you the trip.

35:09.423 --> 35:12.859
Or, if you have a minute now,
we could chat on the phone.

35:13.027 --> 35:16.724
Now is not a good time for me,
I'm driving.

35:16.898 --> 35:18.957
There's really nothing I can do for you.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.368
All right, then, sir.
Sorry to bother you.

35:21.536 --> 35:25.063
I just have one more teeny-tiny question
before I let you go.

35:25.239 --> 35:26.797
Okay.

35:27.475 --> 35:28.806
What's the question?

35:39.420 --> 35:43.049
Sir, are you wearing a seat belt?

35:43.224 --> 35:44.486
What?

36:02.844 --> 36:06.245
- Wow!
- Get out of the car. Now. Now.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.507
Hands where I can see them.

36:14.355 --> 36:15.788
Nice work, Detective Mendoza.

36:17.024 --> 36:20.790
Mario Vargas, I'm deputy chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson of the L.A.P.D.

36:20.962 --> 36:24.329
And at the risk of stating the obvious, sir,
you are under arrest.

36:29.003 --> 36:30.197
I'll take it from here.

36:39.413 --> 36:42.905
<i>Suspect in custody,
Code 4. Nice work, everyone.</i>

36:43.084 --> 36:44.676
<i>Returning to base.</i>

36:50.524 --> 36:52.253
You have the right to remain silent.

36:52.426 --> 36:55.554
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

36:55.730 --> 36:59.291
You have the right to an attorney
and to have one present during questioning.

36:59.467 --> 37:03.301
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided to you by the state.

37:03.471 --> 37:05.371
Have you heard and understood
your rights?

37:05.539 --> 37:07.131
Yes.

37:08.976 --> 37:10.102
Do you want a lawyer?

37:12.680 --> 37:13.704
For what?

37:14.582 --> 37:16.550
All right,
well, I'm in a terrible hurry.

37:16.717 --> 37:20.653
All you have left to do is tell me
where to find Allan Summers.

37:20.821 --> 37:22.288
Why? Is he missing?

37:23.824 --> 37:27.817
Sir, we are way beyond the "I don't know
what you're talking about" phase.

37:27.995 --> 37:30.657
I know exactly what you did
and exactly how you did it.

37:30.831 --> 37:34.232
We will eventually find the computer
used to transfer the money...

37:34.402 --> 37:37.132
...which will connect you
to the bank in the Caymans.

37:39.540 --> 37:42.373
You don't know much
about the Cayman Islands, do you, son?

37:44.478 --> 37:47.572
Sir, the name of the game here
is "leniency"...

37:47.748 --> 37:51.980
...which I will do my very best to arrange
if you tell me right now...

37:52.653 --> 37:54.382
...where to find Allan Summers.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.991
Okay, I'll tell you about Allan Summers.

37:58.225 --> 38:01.490
He took a lot of money
that belonged to other people...

38:01.662 --> 38:03.721
...and what he didn't spend, he lost.

38:03.898 --> 38:09.359
He destroyed thousands of lives
and then just walked away.

38:09.870 --> 38:12.202
Mr. Vargas, you were
your company's risk analyst.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.238
What are you saying, you didn't know
what Summers was up to?

38:15.977 --> 38:20.573
That sounds a lot like my last job interview
and the one before that.

38:21.682 --> 38:24.674
Summers was a swindler
pretending to be a businessman.

38:24.852 --> 38:29.448
He stole $600 million
from people who trusted him.

38:31.359 --> 38:36.262
And what did you do about that?
- Nothing.

38:36.597 --> 38:40.294
You never do anything
about people like Allan Summers.

38:40.468 --> 38:42.902
You mean people
who commit crimes for money?

38:43.337 --> 38:46.135
Sounds a lot like you,
because from where I'm sitting...

38:46.307 --> 38:50.403
...you're nothing but a methodical
bank robber pretending to be a chauffeur.

38:50.578 --> 38:52.978
- You're worse than Allan Summers.
- Worse than...?

38:53.147 --> 38:56.082
- Well, you're the violent one.
- I'm violent? He killed my wife.

38:56.250 --> 38:57.308
Oh, come on.

38:57.485 --> 39:00.545
Allan Summers didn't even know you,
much less your wife.

39:00.721 --> 39:01.915
How did he kill her?

39:03.290 --> 39:06.191
When we lost our jobs,
we lost our healthcare.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.260
My wife got pancreatic cancer.

39:08.429 --> 39:10.693
So your insurance company
killed your wife.

39:10.865 --> 39:12.662
I wouldn't have lost my insurance...

39:12.833 --> 39:15.563
...if Allan Summers
were a decent human being.

39:17.471 --> 39:20.907
Even if he had been
a more decent businessman.

39:21.075 --> 39:26.172
I watched as my wife
lay suffering and blamed herself.

39:26.347 --> 39:27.837
You wanna know what she did?

39:28.015 --> 39:31.883
To save me our last $5000,
she killed herself, okay?

39:32.053 --> 39:33.884
She shot herself in the head...

39:34.055 --> 39:38.116
...because she was too expensive
to take care of anymore.

39:41.162 --> 39:43.528
She died
while she still had a chance to recover.

39:43.697 --> 39:48.566
But what did she have to live for?
He took everything. Everything.

39:53.007 --> 39:54.235
So you arrest me...

39:54.408 --> 39:57.502
...and Allan Summers you want to rescue.
How's that fair?

39:58.379 --> 40:00.870
I don't work for the fairness system, sir.

40:01.215 --> 40:04.013
Allan Summers has done terrible things.

40:04.185 --> 40:06.710
If you tell me where he is...

40:06.887 --> 40:10.721
...I promise to do my best
to get justice for what he took from you.

40:13.094 --> 40:15.790
And how's my wife gonna get that?

40:16.797 --> 40:18.389
Justice?

40:19.500 --> 40:23.027
How do you suppose Allan Summers
could settle accounts with her?

40:23.204 --> 40:26.264
And is this what your wife
would have wanted you to do?

40:26.440 --> 40:28.670
Take the man
who caused all her suffering...

40:29.110 --> 40:31.908
...and yours
and the suffering of thousands of others...

40:32.079 --> 40:35.537
...and transform him
from a criminal into a victim?

40:36.684 --> 40:39.380
Because the longer
it takes for us to find Allan Summers...

40:39.553 --> 40:41.180
...the more sympathetic he becomes.

40:43.624 --> 40:45.387
Is that what you want?

40:48.462 --> 40:51.920
Okay. You wanna know
where Allan Summers is? Fine, I'll tell you.

40:55.769 --> 40:58.431
He's in a hell of his own making.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.800
Right.

41:05.679 --> 41:07.237
Thank you.

41:07.414 --> 41:09.041
Sergeant Gabriel.

41:33.607 --> 41:37.976
- This has to be the place.
- For once, I'm happy to be renting.

41:38.145 --> 41:39.305
"Hell of his own making."

41:40.648 --> 41:42.878
Get us inside, please.

42:00.768 --> 42:02.998
Bathroom clear.

42:11.512 --> 42:13.070
Found him.

42:15.849 --> 42:19.285
Okay, Mr. Vargas. Okay.

42:24.091 --> 42:26.651
Now it's a murder.

42:27.305 --> 42:33.632
