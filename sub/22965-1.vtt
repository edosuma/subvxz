- [Ophthalmologist] Eyesight is perfect.
Corneas are perfect.

02:19.644 --> 02:23.977
- I want Corneal implants.
- There's nothing wrong with your eyes.

02:25.949 --> 02:26.916
There is.

02:27.585 --> 02:29.840
You just probably can't
see with your equipment.

02:34.352 --> 02:35.352
(eerie music)

03:07.687 --> 03:10.109
(dramatic music)

03:12.442 --> 03:14.124
-[Walter]-What are you
doing here, Theodore?

03:15.078 --> 03:16.666
-Is that who I think it is?

03:16.690 --> 03:18.696
-She's no longer your patient.

03:18.721 --> 03:20.311
-Is she yours now?

03:21.549 --> 03:22.682
-Why are you here?

03:25.151 --> 03:27.789
Things would have been very
different if it weren't for her.

03:38.124 --> 03:39.124
Thank you.

03:40.641 --> 03:42.690
- [Theodore]-So...
- [Helen]- So...

03:42.714 --> 03:44.714
- Good news.
- Okay.

03:44.738 --> 03:48.268
Your eggs have been successfully
fertilized with your late husband's sperm.

03:49.110 --> 03:52.377
You requested twins.
We have even better news.

03:52.698 --> 03:54.098
Identical twin girls.

03:55.276 --> 03:58.503
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Oh, don't thank me.

03:58.527 --> 04:02.201
Identical twins are still God's creation
and we're not quite there yet, but

04:02.484 --> 04:04.284
It's only a matter of time.

04:04.391 --> 04:06.991
Michael would - he would be so pleased.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.376
I just want to prepare
you for this, but

04:14.086 --> 04:17.675
It seems your girls have inherited your
husband's gene for cardiac hypertrophy.

04:17.699 --> 04:20.664
- He died at 35.
- I realize that.

04:21.147 --> 04:23.103
Our company has a
solution for this.

04:23.491 --> 04:26.192
Have you heard of the
Universal Genome Program?

04:26.327 --> 04:28.660
A few samples of blood,
skin and saliva...

04:28.685 --> 04:30.366
Yeah, I know what this is.

04:30.592 --> 04:33.881
By matching their genetic profiles
with the millions on our database,

04:34.162 --> 04:36.162
we can predict their medical destiny,

04:36.615 --> 04:40.148
and soon technology will allow
us to repair their future.

04:44.669 --> 04:45.669
Doctor?

Shall I take over?

05:17.579 --> 05:18.712
How are we doing?

05:23.093 --> 05:24.018
-How is she?

05:24.043 --> 05:26.126
-Not looking good.

05:27.054 --> 05:30.587
Her doctor loses it in the
middle of her examination.

05:30.611 --> 05:34.633
- It's not what you think.
- Let me run your junk through the program.

05:35.079 --> 05:39.868
With my code. I could easily
find you similar genetic profiles-

05:39.892 --> 05:41.055
Walter!

05:42.642 --> 05:43.642
Enough.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.414
You won't find me in the program.

05:52.178 --> 05:53.686
- What do you mean?

05:53.711 --> 05:57.679
Every employee submits their
genome to the program.

05:59.296 --> 06:00.629
-I'm not an employee.

06:35.334 --> 06:36.334
(gentle music)

06:38.020 --> 06:39.754
Something's bothering you.

06:46.012 --> 06:47.012
-It's a patient.

06:48.592 --> 06:49.858
-It's bad news, huh?

06:52.240 --> 06:53.440
Have you told her?

06:56.118 --> 06:58.125
-No, it's fine.

07:18.007 --> 07:19.007
- Hello?

07:20.864 --> 07:21.864
Yeah.

07:30.739 --> 07:33.206
Hey, hold on, I got to get a pen.

07:39.006 --> 07:40.006
Okay.

07:44.092 --> 07:45.892
Uh-huh, I know where it is.

07:47.674 --> 07:48.674
What time?

07:50.901 --> 07:51.901
Okay.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.120
Helen,

07:56.393 --> 07:58.326
Don't forget what I said yesterday.

08:14.545 --> 08:16.255
-Hi, good morning.

08:17.162 --> 08:18.162
Hey.

08:21.537 --> 08:24.153
- What are you doing?
- Who was that?

08:25.069 --> 08:27.880
- It was Walter.
- It's Walter? It's Saturday.

08:27.904 --> 08:30.470
- He's a workaholic. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm...

08:30.495 --> 08:31.758
What are you doing
in my robe, huh?

08:31.783 --> 08:34.770
You haven't asked me to move in yet.
I have no clothes.

08:45.488 --> 08:47.449

from London tonight.</i>

08:47.474 --> 08:49.058

is going to happen.</i>

[Voice-over] 911,
what's your emergency?

09:15.517 --> 09:17.242
-[Theodore] -I'd like to report a shooting.

09:17.494 --> 09:20.160
-[Voice-over] Is it happening now?
- [Theodore] No, but it will.

09:20.698 --> 09:22.964
An hour from now.
Parker Pharmacy.

09:22.988 --> 09:24.533
Hertel and Saranac.

09:24.558 --> 09:26.019
-[Voice-over] What's your name, sir?

09:27.188 --> 09:28.588
Has anyone been hurt?

09:38.673 --> 09:39.952
-That's okay, sir.

09:40.502 --> 09:41.782
I'll take care of that.

[elevator dings]

09:52.569 --> 09:54.771
What is your firm's most valuable asset?

09:55.116 --> 09:58.396
Equities? Fixed incomes? Commodities?

09:59.522 --> 10:00.982
Human capital.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.101
Employ the absolute brightest,

10:04.995 --> 10:06.048
the most responsible.

10:06.578 --> 10:07.839
Make them stay.

10:08.643 --> 10:11.044
-They say if you want loyalty, get a dog.

10:13.773 --> 10:16.078
Supposedly no such thing in this business.

10:18.414 --> 10:20.147
Karl's quite the exception.

10:20.898 --> 10:22.157
Stellar performer.

10:22.182 --> 10:24.000
Been with us five years.

10:24.821 --> 10:26.059
Do you want to know why?

10:27.278 --> 10:28.703
We don't discriminate.

10:29.891 --> 10:31.602
-Soon you might have
to, Miss Freeman.

10:32.322 --> 10:36.118
Hiring practices have grown increasingly
sophisticated over the years.

10:36.430 --> 10:39.188
And with all due respect,
what your company does

10:39.213 --> 10:41.967
is quite...it's outdated.

10:43.272 --> 10:45.597
We've done an analysis
on a genetic profile

10:45.622 --> 10:47.048
of someone who works here.

10:49.936 --> 10:51.003
-Yes, of course.

11:03.535 --> 11:04.683
-I get it.

11:05.949 --> 11:07.194
Who are we talking about?

11:23.351 --> 11:24.351
How dare you?

11:26.429 --> 11:27.696
Is this even legal?

11:28.742 --> 11:30.475
- [Theodore] Well, it's...
- [Walter] We merely

11:30.476 --> 11:31.743
interpret the data.

11:31.767 --> 11:35.380
 We interpret it for you.
- What I meant was

11:36.162 --> 11:38.958
is it legal for you? Doctors.

11:41.567 --> 11:44.303
(door opens, closes)

11:46.873 --> 11:48.340
- What does she not get?

11:48.771 --> 11:51.044
We're already screening
embryos and cells.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.287
You okay?

11:55.312 --> 11:57.024
What's up with you in there?

11:58.567 --> 12:00.660
- We blew it, alright?
It's no big deal.

12:00.684 --> 12:02.684
- Yeah. It is when you
have child support.

12:02.708 --> 12:05.699
Right. All in the name of Lydia.

12:07.332 --> 12:08.366
-Screw you!

12:09.086 --> 12:11.490
What is it you think you
know about being a father?

(phone rings)

12:14.359 --> 12:15.359
(clears throat)

12:16.178 --> 12:18.378
- Walter speaking.
-[Ms. Freeman] Dr. Hamilton,

12:19.108 --> 12:22.662
We're interviewing next week. Why
don't you and your partner drop by?

12:22.686 --> 12:23.868
-Stop the car.

12:23.892 --> 12:25.892
[Ms. Freeman] Are you
still there, Doctor?

12:26.274 --> 12:27.607

15:15.628 --> 15:17.895
-I just knew I would
find you here.

15:20.208 --> 15:23.942
We used to come here to
pray when you saw things.

-764 days.

15:31.435 --> 15:32.968
-Is it really that long?

15:34.974 --> 15:37.507
-Why did we stop coming
here, Aunt Kay?

-You grew up, you...

15:42.197 --> 15:43.264
became a doctor,

became obsessed with
finding the cure.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.878
- Half of all genetic
disorders are inherited.

15:57.795 --> 15:59.318
What were they like, my parents?

16:01.805 --> 16:06.839
Can't you acknowledge that there are
still some things in God's hands?

16:07.914 --> 16:08.914
- I know.

16:11.830 --> 16:14.524
The cause may be genetic, but the
solution doesn't have to be.

16:15.314 --> 16:17.567
I can just remove what's
causing the problem.

with your eyes.

16:35.415 --> 16:36.415
- I get visions.

16:39.251 --> 16:41.251
Visions of the imminent future.

16:42.905 --> 16:44.314
- (laughs) Excuse me?

16:45.634 --> 16:47.234
If we were to lock eyes,

16:48.326 --> 16:50.686
and you were going to die
in the next 24 hours,

16:53.138 --> 16:54.938
I'd see your final moments.

16:56.630 --> 16:58.030
- Go someplace else.

Hungry? I'll take you to lunch.

17:29.963 --> 17:32.947
No, thanks. I've already eaten.

17:34.107 --> 17:35.507
You can watch me eat.

- Why weren't you at the funeral?

17:46.963 --> 17:48.358
I thought you were
going to buy me lunch.

17:57.990 --> 17:58.990
Here.

18:00.318 --> 18:01.694
Very generous of you.

18:01.719 --> 18:04.076
I was just starting
to get hungry.

18:05.545 --> 18:07.590
What happened the other
night at the pharmacy?

18:12.472 --> 18:13.472
- It's over.

18:16.050 --> 18:17.584
They found the shooter.

18:18.769 --> 18:20.369
- I searched your computer.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.523
I found a ton of research
on genetic para-normality.

18:27.183 --> 18:28.916
Whatever it is you're
trying to find,

18:29.108 --> 18:32.391
whatever it is you're
trying to hide,

18:33.284 --> 18:34.987
It's got something to do with Helen,

18:35.378 --> 18:37.838
the shooting. and Anna.

18:42.534 --> 18:43.963
- [Walter] Who else
knows about this?

18:44.634 --> 18:45.613
-[Theodore] My Aunt Kay.

18:47.097 --> 18:48.097
- Not even Anna?

18:50.429 --> 18:52.228
You don't trust her, do you?

18:52.253 --> 18:53.962
-It's not about trust.

18:53.986 --> 18:55.346
Then why'd you keep it from her?

18:55.371 --> 18:56.687
-Why'd I keep it from her?

18:57.241 --> 18:58.468
Why did I keep it from you?

18:58.493 --> 19:00.038
Why did I keep it from everyone?

19:03.815 --> 19:06.904
- Have you tried neuroleptics?
- For God's sake, Walter.

19:07.526 --> 19:09.393
These aren't hallucinations.

19:10.206 --> 19:11.810
- You have no idea
what it feels like

19:11.835 --> 19:13.705
to be running from
this your entire life.

19:14.692 --> 19:17.364
To know what's like, to
look inside someone's eyes

19:17.755 --> 19:20.206
and know they are going to die and there
is nothing you can do to stop it.

19:20.966 --> 19:22.863
You stopped Helen from dying.

19:22.888 --> 19:24.523
You altered her future.

19:25.015 --> 19:27.256
Theodore, you played God.

19:28.421 --> 19:31.086
You're capable of
either a lot of good,

19:32.573 --> 19:33.992
or a hell of a lot of bad.

19:39.789 --> 19:40.789
-[Theodore] The Panopticon.

19:41.969 --> 19:44.769
- 18th century prison.
- [Walter] Never heard of it.

19:46.069 --> 19:47.567
England's answer to controlling

19:47.592 --> 19:50.427
hundreds of inmates through
the eyes of a single watchman

19:50.452 --> 19:51.820
from a tower in the center.

19:52.288 --> 19:54.834
He sees everything, knows everything,

19:56.645 --> 19:57.645
but he's alone.

19:59.481 --> 20:00.757
Didn't take him too
long to figure out

20:00.782 --> 20:01.976
who the true prisoner is.

20:02.653 --> 20:04.070
- Why did you become a doctor?

20:05.000 --> 20:06.877
Because you enjoy
self-medication?

20:07.361 --> 20:08.827
Change of perspective.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.009
Better to bring life
into this world

20:13.034 --> 20:14.181
than to watch it go away.

20:14.823 --> 20:15.957
-Join the program.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.190
I'm sure you'll find other
freaks just like you.

20:20.777 --> 20:24.243
-Board-certified geneticist
claims to see the future.

20:26.231 --> 20:27.831
That sound right to you?

20:29.911 --> 20:32.244
- What's the worst that could happen?

20:33.777 --> 20:35.044
-They blacklist me.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.360
Revoke my license.

20:40.590 --> 20:43.323
Might as well give up on
finding the prescient gene.

20:50.493 --> 20:52.260
(gentle dramatic music)

20:52.284 --> 20:54.284
(gentle dramatic music)

21:21.572 --> 21:22.572
(gentle music)

21:24.931 --> 21:25.931
(gentle  music)

21:27.525 --> 21:29.925
- Here. enroll me in the program.

21:29.949 --> 21:32.885
(gentle  music)

21:40.701 --> 21:42.660
-[Theodore] I came here
to give you this.

21:42.685 --> 21:43.629
-You're quitting?

21:43.991 --> 21:45.225
- You can keep my share.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.978
You probably need
it more than me.

21:48.721 --> 21:49.826
- Read the papers?

21:50.590 --> 21:52.543
- I don't read too
well these days.

22:02.338 --> 22:04.864
(eerie music)

22:08.190 --> 22:09.190
(gentle music)

22:10.237 --> 22:11.237
(gentle music)

22:12.737 --> 22:13.737
(gentle music)

22:16.089 --> 22:17.089
(gentle music)

22:19.274 --> 22:20.274
(gentle music)

22:21.946 --> 22:22.946
(gentle music)

22:24.453 --> 22:25.453
(gentle music)

23:14.230 --> 23:15.230
(panting)

23:25.812 --> 23:26.812
(gentle music)

23:29.699 --> 23:30.699
(gentle music)

23:46.694 --> 23:48.373
(eerie music)

23:48.780 --> 23:49.780
(eerie music)

24:06.192 --> 24:07.192
-[Theodore] Anna?

24:14.737 --> 24:15.937
- She was my sister.

24:19.245 --> 24:20.245
- Emma.

24:23.790 --> 24:24.790
Of course.

24:31.899 --> 24:32.899
How are you?

24:35.376 --> 24:36.509
-I'm alright.

24:38.869 --> 24:39.869
(sighs)

24:48.830 --> 24:51.582
You knew there was going to be a
shooting that night, didn't you?

24:57.391 --> 24:59.125
-I didn't know she'd show up.

25:02.294 --> 25:03.294
(gentle music)

25:09.485 --> 25:10.485
(gentle music)

25:22.168 --> 25:23.168
Emma.

25:27.652 --> 25:29.252
- It was nice meeting you.

25:29.397 --> 25:31.790
(heartbeat)

25:33.718 --> 25:34.718
- Whoa.

25:36.374 --> 25:37.374
Are you okay?

25:39.054 --> 25:40.054
What's wrong?

25:42.608 --> 25:46.141
- If it wasn't for you, my
sister would still be alive.

25:49.608 --> 25:51.941
-[Theodore] Seeing her felt
like Anna survived.

25:53.733 --> 25:55.266
- But she didn't survive.

25:57.436 --> 25:59.436
Where are you going with this?

26:01.749 --> 26:02.904
What did she want?

26:03.517 --> 26:05.239
- [Theodore] She didn't say. She just left.

26:08.007 --> 26:09.789
-[Aunt Kay] Something
is not right.

26:10.470 --> 26:11.499
- What do you mean?

26:13.113 --> 26:15.430
- [Aunt Kay] You never
even met her sister,

26:15.455 --> 26:17.147
and suddenly she appears?

26:17.171 --> 26:19.171
-[Theodore] That's why I followed her.

26:22.091 --> 26:23.802
-[Helen]- Hey.
- [Emma]-Hey.

26:23.826 --> 26:26.302
- Sorry I'm horribly late.
I'm sorry.

26:28.474 --> 26:30.007
- [Aunt Kay] Why are you doing this?

26:33.156 --> 26:34.422
It's not your fault

26:35.867 --> 26:39.673
that your girlfriend
was in the wrong place

26:39.698 --> 26:41.341
at the wrong time.

26:43.664 --> 26:45.226
- [Theodore]- She thought
I was cheating on her.

26:49.827 --> 26:51.160
- You don't know that.

26:51.977 --> 26:53.843
When your parents passed on

26:54.757 --> 26:59.686
I wanted you to find
love, have a family.

27:00.913 --> 27:03.780
But the girl you fell
in love with is gone.

27:04.688 --> 27:10.051
You can't just replace her
with her sister.

27:11.547 --> 27:12.547
- [Theodore]- Anna?

27:15.822 --> 27:17.155
- Go to bed, Aunt Kay.

27:19.908 --> 27:23.174
Everything is going to be
alright in the morning.

27:45.167 --> 27:46.167
(gentle music)

27:47.472 --> 27:48.472
(gentle music)

28:09.562 --> 28:10.562
(gentle music)

28:13.258 --> 28:14.258
(gentle music)

28:28.642 --> 28:30.308
- So, what brings you here?

28:33.976 --> 28:35.710
- Tell me what you know about Emma.

28:38.929 --> 28:40.329
(Helen clears throat)

28:44.101 --> 28:45.967
A year after Michael passed,

28:47.362 --> 28:49.151
I joined a support group.

28:51.089 --> 28:53.057
We have a new member
with us here today.

28:53.572 --> 28:55.776
She has also lost someone
very dear to her.

28:57.784 --> 28:58.784
Tell us, Emma.

28:59.447 --> 29:00.447
What happened?

29:04.962 --> 29:05.962
- Hi.

29:07.540 --> 29:11.407
My sister was killed in the
pharmacy shooting a month ago.

29:11.727 --> 29:12.727
(eerie music)

29:13.072 --> 29:16.865
And the police called me
to tell me she's dead.

29:16.890 --> 29:18.904
I didn't understand. I mean...

29:18.929 --> 29:21.332
- [Helen]- I couldn't believe she
was sitting in my support group.

29:21.356 --> 29:22.934
What is it?

29:25.634 --> 29:28.368
- I wish it was me who
got shot that night.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.392
Should have been.

29:31.321 --> 29:32.416
-[Theodor] -What did she mean by that?

29:34.508 --> 29:36.108
[Helen] Survivor's guilt, maybe.

29:38.745 --> 29:42.135
- Is that why you befriended her?
- You know the answer to that.

29:46.661 --> 29:50.802
- Did you tell her you were the one-
 - Of course not.

29:53.086 --> 29:55.916
How do you tell someone
that you are alive

29:55.941 --> 29:58.244
because someone
they love is dead?

29:59.792 --> 30:04.482
That your... your destiny
was... substituted?

30:07.997 --> 30:09.767
Somehow I had assumed
you'd stopped it.

30:24.250 --> 30:25.953
You have to find a
way to move on.

30:26.664 --> 30:29.331
You... you can't keep
living in the past.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.320
- Look, Helen...

30:33.637 --> 30:35.269
There's something
you need to know.

30:36.106 --> 30:38.379
The woman who took your place
was someone I was seeing.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.866
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

30:47.168 --> 30:49.048
- You still haven't told
me why she was here.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.035
- [Helen] It's about her husband.

30:53.827 --> 30:54.827
[eerie music]

30:56.300 --> 30:58.300
[Voice-over] -Hey, it's
Emma, leave a message

30:59.800 --> 31:00.866
Listen, it's me.

31:01.753 --> 31:02.219
We need to talk...

31:02.244 --> 31:03.488
[voice-over] -The mailbox
is full and cannot

31:03.512 --> 31:05.877
accept any messages at this time. Goodbye.

31:10.436 --> 31:11.436
[eerie music]

31:13.578 --> 31:14.578
[eerie music]

31:26.442 --> 31:27.442
[water running]

31:27.895 --> 31:28.962
[doorbell rings]

31:35.074 --> 31:37.261
[thunder and wind]

31:45.435 --> 31:46.578
- [Nurse] Dr.Meridian called

31:46.603 --> 31:47.622
to say he'll be in late.

31:50.489 --> 31:51.589
- Did he say why?

31:51.614 --> 31:53.785
-[Nurse]-Just asked if you would
cover his appointments.

32:04.837 --> 32:05.837
[eerie music]

32:08.297 --> 32:09.297
[door closes]

32:19.359 --> 32:21.492
-[Emma] -Sorry. I had nowhere else to go.

32:21.516 --> 32:23.516
-What happened?

32:27.149 --> 32:28.887
My husband thinks that 9laughs0

32:29.367 --> 32:31.367
my lover is here
to fuck me 'cause

32:32.265 --> 32:35.351
some guy rang the doorbell
and just vanished.

32:35.585 --> 32:37.585
[screaming]

32:37.609 --> 32:40.044
[screaming]

32:42.422 --> 32:45.804
It's been, what? A month?

32:55.527 --> 32:57.394
I really miss her, you know.

33:00.027 --> 33:04.987
When my sister died, I
felt it right here.

33:06.483 --> 33:08.532
It's like my artery
tore the moment

33:08.557 --> 33:11.061
the bullet ripped
through her heart.

33:14.938 --> 33:17.500
I still feel it sometimes.

33:25.173 --> 33:27.985
How did you know there was going
to be a shooting that night?

33:32.314 --> 33:35.300
-I know you're still trying to
come to terms with what happened.

33:36.771 --> 33:38.685
Believe me, I'm trying to do the same.

33:44.451 --> 33:46.184
The night before she died,

33:48.891 --> 33:54.219
I saw her eyes, they
were calm, peaceful.

33:56.242 --> 33:58.383
I know this is going
to sound crazy, but...

34:02.037 --> 34:04.737
I knew someone was going to die
the day before, and I knew there

34:04.762 --> 34:07.162
was absolutely no way she was
going to die the next day.

34:13.454 --> 34:14.987
-I think I need a drink.

34:22.524 --> 34:23.524
[pouring]

34:34.972 --> 34:35.972
Thank you.

34:37.543 --> 34:38.543
[gentle music]

35:05.116 --> 35:06.116
- I'm sorry.

35:09.092 --> 35:10.626
You look just like her.

35:12.577 --> 35:13.577
[sighs]

35:16.784 --> 35:21.118
- On the morning of the shooting I
was on the phone with my sister.

35:27.233 --> 35:28.920
She said that

35:30.514 --> 35:33.914
her husband was coming back
from London that night.

35:40.062 --> 35:43.662
They'd gotten into this huge
fight before he left, and

35:44.882 --> 35:49.807
she was really worried that he
was going to hit her again.

35:51.429 --> 35:52.429
[eerie music]

35:55.419 --> 35:57.313
I didn't know how bad it was.

35:57.338 --> 35:58.643
She never told me.

36:02.864 --> 36:04.731
But I wanted to protect her.

36:07.607 --> 36:10.274
-(Anna) Hey, remember this
game we used to play?

36:12.350 --> 36:14.150
Listen, I'll do it for you.

36:15.331 --> 36:17.975
[dramatic music]

36:18.331 --> 36:19.331
[dramatic music]

36:20.659 --> 36:21.726
[dramatic music]

36:26.452 --> 36:28.568
- [Emma] So I told my sister

36:29.741 --> 36:31.741
maybe I should take her place.

36:49.464 --> 36:51.323
Wait, wait.

36:58.602 --> 36:59.935
What are you saying?

37:01.781 --> 37:04.532
- I'm so sorry.
- Who died in my arms?

37:04.556 --> 37:07.642
I'm so sorry, I was the one that
sent my sister to the pharmacy.

37:08.041 --> 37:09.559
I should have been the one dead.

37:10.859 --> 37:11.859
- Anna?

37:16.383 --> 37:18.629
I thought you were
dead for a long-

37:18.668 --> 37:19.990
- I'm sorry, Theo, I'm sorry.
- What were you thinking?

37:20.015 --> 37:24.114
I wasn't thinking, I wasn't
thinking, I just wasn't thinking.

37:24.637 --> 37:27.056
-Your family! Your family
thinks- look at me.

37:27.080 --> 37:30.446
Look at me, look at me. Your
family thinks you're dead.

37:30.470 --> 37:32.470
- I know. I know.
- You had a goddamn funeral.

37:32.494 --> 37:34.494
- I know. I know. I know.
- You had a funeral.

37:36.708 --> 37:38.708
-You weren't at my funeral, Theo.

37:42.755 --> 37:45.224
-Why, Why, why are you
trying to be your sister?

37:46.341 --> 37:51.365
I thought it would make the pain go
away because it was... it was just...

37:51.629 --> 37:53.496
It was just hurting so much.

37:53.576 --> 37:55.832
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't do it anymore.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.175
-Why didn't, Shh!
- I couldn't do it anymore.I couldn't.

37:57.200 --> 37:57.995
-Why didn't you tell me?

37:58.019 --> 37:59.379
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't tell you.

37:59.403 --> 38:01.301
If I told you, you wouldn't
let me go through with this.

38:01.325 --> 38:03.325
I couldn't tell you.

38:03.676 --> 38:07.613
- You're with Karl! You're with Karl!
You're with--

38:08.055 --> 38:10.470
That's fucked up! That's fucked up!

38:12.289 --> 38:15.160
-Theo, listen to me, I'm sorry.

38:15.786 --> 38:16.786
I'm sorry.

38:17.263 --> 38:19.078
But Karl is a really sick man.

38:19.103 --> 38:24.401
He did some really horrible
things to my sister,

38:24.426 --> 38:26.612
and I really need
to do this for her.

38:26.637 --> 38:29.900
I didn't help her when she was
alive but I can help her now.

38:31.032 --> 38:32.853
I need to make him pay for this.

38:35.243 --> 38:37.805
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:37.961 --> 38:39.961
I'm sorry. (crying) I'm sorry.

38:40.488 --> 38:43.220
I'm sorry. (crying) I'm sorry.

38:43.394 --> 38:46.843
-It's crazy. How can
anybody live like that?

38:47.382 --> 38:49.022
Do you trust her?

38:49.398 --> 38:53.866
-I... I'm not sure.

39:05.510 --> 39:06.510
[eerie music]

39:10.213 --> 39:11.479
-What's the problem?

39:12.713 --> 39:16.783
-Like I said, I don't read
too well these days.

39:17.416 --> 39:20.682
- It says "Freak accident in
Wescott building", asshole.

39:22.734 --> 39:24.934
What the hell
happened yesterday?

39:25.765 --> 39:29.032
- You killed a man.
- That's not how I would put it.

39:29.844 --> 39:31.244
-How would you put it?

39:33.010 --> 39:35.210
And could you look
me in the eye?

39:46.624 --> 39:49.957
- Please finish that.
- I'm really not that hungry.

39:51.280 --> 39:54.112
- If you don't finish that, I
won't take you to the museum.

39:57.988 --> 39:59.815
- [Lydia] Uncle Theo!
- Hey.

40:00.769 --> 40:02.036
Are you joining us?

40:03.121 --> 40:04.121
Why not?

40:05.832 --> 40:07.583
We're going to chat
for a few minutes,

40:07.608 --> 40:08.613
Uncle Theo and I.

40:09.564 --> 40:11.950
I expect that to be done
by the time we get back.

40:12.603 --> 40:13.603
See? Mmm...

40:13.994 --> 40:17.039
Mmm... yummy. Finish that, please.

40:17.330 --> 40:18.330
-See ya, kiddo.

40:23.459 --> 40:24.726
Brilliant parenting.

40:24.751 --> 40:26.728
-Tell me that when you
have kids of your own.

40:26.752 --> 40:29.904
- Seeing how you treat yours
makes me not want to have any.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.841
- (laughs) This morning,

40:32.866 --> 40:35.708
very responsible of you to
walk out on your patients.

40:36.390 --> 40:40.363
Listen, I was going through the
profiles of Freeman Capital

40:40.733 --> 40:42.247
Why don't we have
current employees?

40:42.686 --> 40:45.865
- We only screen the new batch of hires.
- You should scan current employees.

40:45.889 --> 40:47.581
It's the future of the business.

40:47.605 --> 40:50.710
Well, is your idea of the future
rampant layoffs and broken families.

40:50.945 --> 40:55.061
- We're not the firing squad.
- You're always going on about money.

40:55.666 --> 40:56.947
This could be a cash cow.

41:00.072 --> 41:02.058
-You got something against
one of their employees?

41:03.675 --> 41:04.934
(screaming)

41:07.812 --> 41:11.413
- Why would you say that?
- Is this another one of your predictions?

41:13.827 --> 41:14.842
What if you're wrong?

41:16.194 --> 41:17.261
-I'm never wrong.

41:17.648 --> 41:20.196
-Did you see Anna's death
the night before she died?

41:27.006 --> 41:29.000
[dramatic music]

41:29.655 --> 41:31.491
- I've out-performed
every other trader.

41:31.515 --> 41:33.515
- I'm not hearing a
question, Karl.

41:34.819 --> 41:37.002
-I've made a ton of money for this firm.

41:37.443 --> 41:38.799
for you.

41:39.467 --> 41:41.961
- All I'm asking is that...
- No.

41:42.535 --> 41:44.250
We've been through this before.

41:44.274 --> 41:46.274
[gentle music]

41:54.378 --> 41:55.378
[elevator bell dings]

42:00.387 --> 42:01.387
[gentle music]

42:05.331 --> 42:06.331
[gentle music]

42:31.664 --> 42:33.931
- [Walter] Whatchya working on?
- [Theodore] A patient.

42:42.760 --> 42:44.560
-Someone like... Emma Palmer?

42:46.807 --> 42:50.539
- What makes you think that?
- Well, I saw the Palmers at the funeral.

42:51.518 --> 42:54.614
Whatever is going on with Mrs.
Palmer I suggest you end it.

42:55.792 --> 42:57.232
You don't know what
he's done to her.

42:58.572 --> 42:59.772
I know what she's done to you.

43:00.148 --> 43:02.195
-She's a victim of
domestic violence.

43:02.572 --> 43:03.551
-So?

43:04.039 --> 43:07.131
You think by helping her you
could make it up to her sister.

43:08.970 --> 43:12.170
But Anna's dead, and there
is nothing you can...

43:15.504 --> 43:17.520
For someone who claims
to see the future,

43:17.545 --> 43:20.328
you're spending an awful lot
of time living in your past.

43:27.449 --> 43:29.214
[water dripping]

43:32.722 --> 43:35.748

44:21.379 --> 44:22.379
[gentle music]

44:25.198 --> 44:26.249
- [Nurse] Dr.Meridian?

44:26.274 --> 44:27.920
Your new patient is
here to see you.

44:28.615 --> 44:30.552
-Have her wait in my office. Thank you.

44:53.262 --> 44:56.051
- [Anna] What happens to your instincts
when you needed them the most?

44:58.528 --> 45:00.535
- Can't hurt to have a little objectivity.

45:01.356 --> 45:03.742
- [Anna] Or be completely blinded by it.

45:06.575 --> 45:08.575
What are you doing here, Anna?

45:10.157 --> 45:12.930
I've got a present for you.

45:29.915 --> 45:31.049
Who's the father?

45:37.141 --> 45:38.141
[gentle music]

45:41.956 --> 45:42.956
[gentle music]

45:47.240 --> 45:48.240
-[Walter]- Okay.

45:55.248 --> 45:56.248
Just a little pinch.

46:01.334 --> 46:02.334
Ready?

46:06.997 --> 46:09.022
Band-aid.

46:09.046 --> 46:11.046
Okay, put it right on there.

46:22.460 --> 46:24.991
[dramatic music]

[rain falling]

46:36.044 --> 46:38.044
[rain falling]

46:45.556 --> 46:47.108
- [Ms. Freeman] What do
you have for me, doctor?

46:47.548 --> 46:51.146
45% OCD, 72% kleptomania,

46:51.250 --> 46:52.742
88% violence.

46:53.024 --> 46:56.773
An overwhelmingly high number of
indicators suggest psychopathic behaviors

46:56.797 --> 47:00.138
This man does not belong
inside any investment firm.

47:00.373 --> 47:01.506
[phone vibrating]

47:03.225 --> 47:04.225
- [Ms. Freeman] Yes, Karl.

47:05.530 --> 47:06.530
Okay.

47:08.311 --> 47:09.311
So...

47:10.304 --> 47:12.037
who are we talking about?

47:13.733 --> 47:14.733
Him.

47:15.306 --> 47:16.732
-He's one of our best.

47:17.422 --> 47:18.571
What does your boss think?

47:18.821 --> 47:20.352
-Well, the data doesn't lie.

47:20.468 --> 47:21.796
With a genetic profile like his,

47:21.821 --> 47:23.695
there is a very high possibility
he will commit fraud,

47:23.720 --> 47:25.021
if he hasn't already.

47:26.797 --> 47:30.315
-How certain are you?
-We're all prisoners of our genes.

47:32.127 --> 47:34.860
-You said he was one of your best.
-Makes a killing.

47:34.884 --> 47:37.752
Every time a stock tanks.

47:37.892 --> 47:41.559
-Or the whole market crashes.
-That's unbelievable.

47:43.166 --> 47:45.694
Are you...saying you can
see the future, or...

47:52.094 --> 47:53.228
[Dramatic music]

47:54.885 --> 47:58.097
-Still searching for a match?
-What were you trying to find?

47:58.121 --> 48:00.980
Forget it. I found my man.

48:01.218 --> 48:03.907
Just like me, he sees the future.

48:04.446 --> 48:08.237
Karl Palmer. I bet you he
has a prescient gene, too.

48:10.161 --> 48:14.027
You can stop the search.
-Well, you had it on overnight.

48:14.051 --> 48:15.691
Saw your parameters.

48:16.241 --> 48:18.010
What were you looking for?

48:18.669 --> 48:20.996
- Anyone with a similar
genetic profile of mine.

48:22.810 --> 48:23.810
Why?

48:26.428 --> 48:27.428
Why?

48:30.971 --> 48:32.038
[dramatic music]

48:33.791 --> 48:34.791
(dramatic music)

48:41.565 --> 48:42.565
(Water flowing)

48:44.027 --> 48:45.775
- [Theodore] Who's
Cooper McCaffrey?

48:48.974 --> 48:50.379
- Where is this coming from?

48:50.708 --> 48:53.801
- You told me my parents died in
a car accident when I was one.

48:54.786 --> 48:56.098
So, who's Cooper McCaffrey?

48:58.341 --> 48:59.808
He didn't die, did he?

49:02.295 --> 49:03.961
-He didn't care about you.

49:04.131 --> 49:05.105
He didn't love you.

49:05.130 --> 49:06.514
-How could you lie to me?

49:06.990 --> 49:09.081
That's why you never wanted me
to join the program, wasn't it?

49:09.967 --> 49:11.425
Who the hell's Meridian?

49:12.524 --> 49:14.354
- I wanted to protect you.

49:15.020 --> 49:17.962
Meridian is something I
made up 30 years ago.

49:20.048 --> 49:21.966
You think that was gonna
stop me finding him?

49:22.806 --> 49:25.206
-It was to stop him from finding you.

49:27.306 --> 49:28.706
You're not my mother.

49:30.564 --> 49:31.852
What gave you the right?

49:33.111 --> 49:35.449
[eerie music]

49:58.777 --> 49:59.777
[knocking]

50:09.261 --> 50:10.261
- Sir?

50:11.183 --> 50:12.183
It's you!

50:13.529 --> 50:14.595
[dramatic music]

50:17.292 --> 50:18.426
What do you want?

50:19.025 --> 50:20.291
Are you Cooper McCaffrey?

50:21.993 --> 50:23.861
Are you from that genome Program?

50:29.830 --> 50:30.659
[Cooper] Beer?

50:30.684 --> 50:31.548
- No thanks.

50:31.572 --> 50:34.575
-Come on, I already opened it.
-No, really

50:35.356 --> 50:36.452
-Well...

50:38.895 --> 50:40.892
Are you still here
with good news

50:41.379 --> 50:42.379
about my son?

50:45.211 --> 50:46.345
Did you find him?

50:48.524 --> 50:50.457
-We've narrowed it down to three.

50:51.727 --> 50:55.038
At this point, what's left is
just to cross-check some data.

51:00.147 --> 51:03.124
Could you describe the circumstances
under which you lost your son?

51:07.725 --> 51:09.525
- It's been such a long time.

51:10.666 --> 51:12.866
-So long that you've forgotten him?

51:27.335 --> 51:29.269
This was the last time I saw him.

51:31.038 --> 51:32.972
He was a pretty ordinary kid,

51:33.953 --> 51:35.242
other than one weird...

51:38.005 --> 51:39.605
His mother said he saw things.

51:42.825 --> 51:44.726
Things that you and I can't see.

51:47.239 --> 51:48.306
Terrible things.

51:52.660 --> 51:53.660
What did he see?

51:56.652 --> 51:59.347
I guess he was about a year
old when it happened.

52:01.215 --> 52:03.148
Took a road-trip winter '77.

52:06.173 --> 52:08.970
You cried the whole way, the
moment we put him in the car.

52:13.033 --> 52:14.615
I guess that was his
way of telling us,

52:17.201 --> 52:18.201
Bur how would we know?

52:20.349 --> 52:23.952
Next thing I know, bam, we're skidding
off the road down to a ravine.

52:29.149 --> 52:30.586
His momma, my Jane,

52:32.352 --> 52:33.886
went into a coma.

52:38.541 --> 52:39.875
I loved her so much.

52:42.737 --> 52:44.203
She never woke up.

52:49.428 --> 52:52.115
I can--I can still hear his
crying in my head.

52:55.373 --> 52:56.373
So, uh...

53:00.583 --> 53:01.583
[crying]

53:03.172 --> 53:04.172
I left him.

53:15.046 --> 53:16.579
I regretted it even since.

53:25.022 --> 53:26.022
He looks happy.

53:28.467 --> 53:29.534
Used to be.

53:33.428 --> 53:35.561
Why after all these years did-

53:38.949 --> 53:39.949
[eerie music]

53:41.116 --> 53:42.982

54:19.045 --> 54:20.112
The kid's yours.

54:20.694 --> 54:22.857
A daughter, congratulations.

54:23.710 --> 54:25.043
Welcome to my world.

54:27.155 --> 54:28.155
Are you okay?

54:32.312 --> 54:36.115
Check for unauthorized
trades, fake accounts,

54:36.875 --> 54:39.836
unusual transactions, anything,

54:40.070 --> 54:42.762
that warrants a second look
for fraudulent activity.

54:44.098 --> 54:46.396
- [Karl's assistant] -They're
going through everything.

54:46.421 --> 54:49.866
- [Karl] -Just do as I say and
everything's gonna be fine.

54:51.028 --> 54:53.361
[Karl's assistant] -I'm not
doing time for fraud, Karl.

55:04.573 --> 55:06.951
- [Anna]- Karl's gonna
bolt, Switzerland.

55:06.976 --> 55:08.730
And he thinks the baby is his.

55:09.698 --> 55:12.113
[Theodore] -Oh good. It worked.

55:12.596 --> 55:14.367
Either he leaves or he's doing time.

55:15.914 --> 55:17.447
- [Anna]- That's not good enough.

55:22.187 --> 55:24.656
Do you remember what it was
like before any of this?

55:25.703 --> 55:27.570
When it was just you and me?

55:27.595 --> 55:30.082
Theo, we can't go back to the
past, how can you possibly

55:30.107 --> 55:32.200
think that? Isn't it
enough that he just died?

55:32.960 --> 55:35.225
-If you wanted him dead, you
would have done it already.

55:37.995 --> 55:39.862
Killing isn't in your genes.

55:41.058 --> 55:43.000
There's a right time for everything.

55:44.464 --> 55:47.159
- And a right person. Me.

55:48.308 --> 55:51.542
So you don't get your
hands dirty, is that it?

56:04.850 --> 56:06.436
[gentle music]

56:07.786 --> 56:10.676
It's late, what are you doing here?

56:13.107 --> 56:16.010
During the last month, all I ever
thought about were two things.

56:18.122 --> 56:22.256
What I'd do to get things back
to how they were with Anna and all.

56:25.055 --> 56:28.579
And what I'd do to isolate and destroy
the gene responsible for this mess.

56:34.032 --> 56:35.565
I see your predicament.

56:37.245 --> 56:39.368
If Carl indeed has the prescient gene,

56:41.268 --> 56:46.557
without him, you may never find
a cure for your condition.

56:48.142 --> 56:50.643
-Does she know that?
-She doesn't care.

56:51.915 --> 56:56.182
-All she wants to do is kill him.
-(laughs) -Yeah, well, not a good idea.

56:59.367 --> 57:00.900
What's the alternative?

57:03.460 --> 57:04.460
-I kill him.

57:14.796 --> 57:15.796
- Hey, baby!

57:20.913 --> 57:21.913

59:23.317 --> 59:25.520
We have a warrant for the
arrest of Karl Palmer.

59:25.653 --> 59:27.751
He's accused of committing
fraud, embezzlement,

59:27.776 --> 59:29.739
and security violations
at Freeman capital.

59:29.763 --> 59:31.763

[eerie music]

59:57.402 --> 59:59.002
We're closed, Mr. Palmer.

01:00:01.653 --> 01:00:03.053
-[Karl] -My wife,

01:00:03.961 --> 01:00:05.630
why did she come and see you?

01:00:07.294 --> 01:00:09.561
-There's been some kind of mistake.

01:00:12.124 --> 01:00:13.522
-I know she was here.

01:00:14.765 --> 01:00:16.498
And I know she's pregnant.

01:00:18.936 --> 01:00:21.470
I have a right to
know about my child.

01:00:23.689 --> 01:00:24.689
I'm sorry.

01:00:26.009 --> 01:00:28.076
We have client confidentiality.

01:00:29.366 --> 01:00:30.366
(Karl laughs)

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:51.063
I've seen your file.

01:00:52.589 --> 01:00:54.302
You're manic, violent.

01:00:55.082 --> 01:00:56.282
Prone to neurosis.

01:00:57.527 --> 01:00:58.860
It's not your fault.

01:01:00.129 --> 01:01:01.714
You're a victim of your genes.

01:01:03.995 --> 01:01:05.443
You blame it on my genes?

01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:07.190
[laughing]

01:01:10.893 --> 01:01:12.893
I asked you a simple question.

01:01:14.912 --> 01:01:17.628
- I know how you timed your
trades and beat the market.

01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.106
But how is it you can predict the future?

01:01:23.755 --> 01:01:25.555
Who the hell told you that?

01:01:26.017 --> 01:01:30.962
We're alike. I see
it with my eyes.

01:01:32.705 --> 01:01:34.972
Are you seeing
anything right now?

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:39.729
(groaning)

01:01:42.033 --> 01:01:44.736
Analysis was right.
You're obsessively vain.

01:01:45.831 --> 01:01:48.706
-Alright asshole, I'm
asking you one last time.

01:01:49.603 --> 01:01:51.603
Why did she come to see you?!!

01:01:54.129 --> 01:01:55.463
- (groans) It ain't your child.

got his wish, didn't he?

01:02:19.618 --> 01:02:22.442
-What wish?
-Corneal implants.

01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:32.039
- He's going to be able
to see again, right?

01:02:32.321 --> 01:02:33.268
Depends.

01:02:33.293 --> 01:02:36.134
Get him home. Let him rest.

01:02:36.602 --> 01:02:38.869
Keep the bandages on for 24 hours.

01:02:41.734 --> 01:02:42.801

[gentle music]

01:03:38.354 --> 01:03:40.511
So you're no longer prescient?

01:03:41.971 --> 01:03:43.104
- I don't think so.

01:03:46.057 --> 01:03:48.011
I bet you'd love to
know how I did it.

01:03:50.205 --> 01:03:51.271
- Why'd you do it?

01:03:52.322 --> 01:03:53.813
Because of what he did to you?

01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:57.493
Or what he did to her?
-Neither.

01:03:58.631 --> 01:04:01.165
But I know you would've
done the same.

01:04:12.395 --> 01:04:13.462
[dramatic music]

01:04:16.415 --> 01:04:17.415
- [Anna] Theo?

01:04:20.915 --> 01:04:22.581
Theo, what are you doing?

01:04:22.605 --> 01:04:24.852
You can't take them off.
-I've got to go.

01:04:24.876 --> 01:04:26.876
-Why?
-Just take me to the car.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:28.328
Where are you going?

01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:31.136
Alright. You drive.

01:05:28.802 --> 01:05:29.802
He's not in.

01:05:31.615 --> 01:05:32.615
-We're too late.
-What?

01:05:34.801 --> 01:05:35.801
Freeman Capital.

01:05:35.825 --> 01:05:37.343
Theo!

01:05:39.609 --> 01:05:40.609
- Why, Karl?

01:05:42.507 --> 01:05:43.908
-I can't help it.

01:05:43.933 --> 01:05:46.569
They tell me it's in my genes.

01:05:47.452 --> 01:05:50.678
Five years I've slaved
my life for you

01:05:50.702 --> 01:05:54.101
Now, you set the dogs on me.

01:06:21.335 --> 01:06:23.802
I've notified my
bank at Switzerland.

01:06:25.038 --> 01:06:26.571
You've got ten minutes!

- [Theo] Cooper! Stay
away from the elevator!

01:06:37.467 --> 01:06:40.020
Stay, stay.

01:06:40.712 --> 01:06:42.712
- I know that look in your eyes.

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.220
Who are you?

- What makes you think
you'll get away with this?

01:07:30.199 --> 01:07:31.665
It's all client money.

01:07:33.325 --> 01:07:36.515
- Don't worry, I'm only
taking your share.

01:08:05.387 --> 01:08:06.787
- Don't try to stop me.

01:08:09.754 --> 01:08:10.754
-Karl will live.

01:08:12.617 --> 01:08:13.751
and you will die.

your daughter will die.

01:08:28.487 --> 01:08:30.220

[elevator bell rings]

01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:26.770
- [Theo] Palmer!

01:09:28.801 --> 01:09:31.135
- What are you doing here?
Stay back!

01:09:32.854 --> 01:09:35.551
I said stay back.

01:09:36.557 --> 01:09:38.526
We've got one of two
ways to do this.

01:09:41.595 --> 01:09:43.529
Let's try the easy one first.

01:09:45.564 --> 01:09:46.697
Turn yourself in.

01:09:50.447 --> 01:09:53.788
Well, perhaps finding out the truth
about your wife will change things.

01:09:54.947 --> 01:09:55.947
- What truth?

01:09:58.667 --> 01:10:00.612
Do you remember who
your wife was?

01:10:02.269 --> 01:10:04.537
Ever ask yourself who she is now?

01:10:07.448 --> 01:10:09.854
Whoever you think is
waiting for you down there

01:10:09.879 --> 01:10:12.635
in the lobby, she's not
who she used to be.

01:10:14.792 --> 01:10:15.792
Your wife,

01:10:18.021 --> 01:10:19.021
your real wife,

01:10:20.834 --> 01:10:22.115
was killed in the shooting.

01:10:25.006 --> 01:10:26.339
She died in my arms,

01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:31.844
leaving her sister

01:10:32.837 --> 01:10:35.578
with nothing but
grief and vengeance.

01:10:41.282 --> 01:10:43.016
You poisoned her soul.

01:10:45.415 --> 01:10:46.615
She will kill you.

01:10:48.336 --> 01:10:50.336
Even if it means she dies too.

01:10:52.383 --> 01:10:54.476
That's the truth you deserve to know.

01:10:57.508 --> 01:10:59.984
- And you're here to save me?

01:11:03.289 --> 01:11:04.823
I'm not falling for it.

01:11:19.815 --> 01:11:21.149
My wife is pregnant.

01:11:26.026 --> 01:11:27.360
We're having a baby.

[dramatic music]

01:11:44.373 --> 01:11:45.573
We should back up.

[gentle music]

01:12:18.386 --> 01:12:21.729
My quest for the elusive prescient
gene has taught me one thing.

01:12:23.636 --> 01:12:25.229
Science has its limitations.

01:12:37.988 --> 01:12:40.534
Ironically, the future has
never been so unclear.

So uncertain.

[gentle music]

01:13:41.506 --> 01:13:45.372
Sometimes, we need to take the
risk of being a bad person

01:13:47.482 --> 01:13:49.017
before we could
become a good one.

01:13:52.748 --> 01:13:53.748
I was once told

01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:57.663
for someone who sees the future,

01:13:58.491 --> 01:14:01.109
I spend an awful lot of
time living in the past.

01:14:04.131 --> 01:14:05.973
I figured it was time to move on.
