00:41.800 --> 00:46.110
'The blazing July sun
was welcomed as a gift

00:46.160 --> 00:50.470
'in the crowded streets of Poplar.
Whites were bleached dry

00:50.520 --> 00:53.510
'by it, skin was toasted brown.

00:53.560 --> 00:57.590
'The sunshine was both
medicine and tonic.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.110
'It could strengthen bones,

00:59.160 --> 01:04.830
'make the spirits sing and the
world felt revived, rinsed clean

01:04.879 --> 01:08.400
'and full of fresh potential.'

01:19.550 --> 01:20.550
That better?

01:20.600 --> 01:23.520
That's it, Janice. Keep breathing.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.800
You're doing really well, Janice.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.540
Our Father, who art in heaven...

01:35.280 --> 01:37.390
.. hallowed be thy name.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.380
Thy Kingdom come...

01:41.120 --> 01:43.710
Well done, Janice. Head's born.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.440
~ .. our daily bread...
~ .. and forgive us our trespasses...

01:51.600 --> 01:55.150
Ten fingers, ten toes

01:55.200 --> 01:57.280
and plenty to say!

01:58.960 --> 02:00.830
Hello, sweetheart!

02:04.760 --> 02:06.920
Mr Prendergast...

02:08.160 --> 02:10.699
Congratulations, Mr Prendergast.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.840
Oh, my!

02:30.320 --> 02:31.910
He's perfect, Janice.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.960
A perfect little boy.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.630
I've brought you a cup of tea.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.750
I don't think you'll
get a chance later on.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.640
~ The waiting room is absolutely packed.
~ Thank you.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.910
I'm afraid we've had a call from
Dr Greenwood's receptionist.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.550
His locum's fallen through.

03:05.600 --> 03:09.190
Can we take 40 of his patients while
he has two weeks in Lyme Regis?

03:09.240 --> 03:11.430
I did tell her you
were already covering

03:11.480 --> 03:12.910
extra patients for Dr Hammond.

03:12.960 --> 03:17.750
If it's just two weeks,
I'm sure we'll be fine.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.590
I'm not sure it's a
good idea, Patrick.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.190
~ You're looking terribly tired, as it is.
~ It'll be fine,

03:23.240 --> 03:27.670
honestly. Now, I'd better see

03:27.720 --> 03:30.800
~ Miss Phillips.
~ I'll send her in.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.750
What?

03:36.800 --> 03:42.390
Oh nothing, really. Just, two weeks
in Lyme Regis does sound nice.

03:42.440 --> 03:43.920
Next year.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.030
But I don't want it back!
It was a present.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.710
An engagement present.
And I loved it.

03:56.760 --> 04:00.430
~ But I can't keep any of these now.
~ Oh, Trixie, you sure about this?

04:00.480 --> 04:03.230
Well, I admit, yours
was hard to part with,

04:03.280 --> 04:06.230
but some of the others are
proving considerably easier.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.630
~ That's not what I meant and you know it.
~ Don't, Patsy.

04:09.680 --> 04:14.590
Well, you look miserable,
Tom looks wretched.

04:14.640 --> 04:17.380
It seems like such a hasty decision.

04:18.240 --> 04:21.230
Maybe if you were just to talk
things through with him,

04:21.279 --> 04:24.310
~ you could...
~ Anyway, I wanted to show you this.

04:24.360 --> 04:28.200
"Wild Peach". Isn't it glorious?

04:29.680 --> 04:32.390
I'm hoping Mrs Prendergast
has had a better night.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.270
The baby isn't settling, at all.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.870
I don't think those parents
have slept for a week.

04:36.920 --> 04:40.270
~ Oh, poor thing.
~ Lovely day again, Nurse Crane!

04:40.320 --> 04:42.830
Ooh-hoo! Like a furnace
in here already.

04:42.880 --> 04:46.950
Nothing lovely about getting roasted

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
like a Sunday dinner.

04:55.720 --> 04:59.760
Hello! Can I help? You
look a bit uncomfortable.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.030
She doesn't speak English.

05:02.080 --> 05:07.590
Well, yours is very good. I was just
asking if she needed any help.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.470
Tomar shajo lagboni, amma?
Thai jihgas korche.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.070
Na, bacha mathor.

05:13.120 --> 05:16.160
She says she's fine. It's just
because she's having a baby.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.390
I can see that.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.630
But she's having trouble walking.

05:20.680 --> 05:24.070
Well, I'm a midwife, actually. I'm...

05:25.240 --> 05:26.380
Oh.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.430
Erm...

05:44.320 --> 05:48.710
Time to get a move on, if you
don't want to miss your train,

05:48.760 --> 05:50.720
Sister Mary Cynthia.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.950
I wish you'd let me carry that.
You've had an operation.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.870
Not on my arms, I haven't. Anyway,
I'll be hoisting pregnant women

06:00.920 --> 06:04.640
up beds soon enough. I've got
to get used to some weight.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.590
Ready?

06:08.600 --> 06:12.390
Well, I'm looking forward to getting
back to my mothers and babies.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.070
I've really missed the midwifery.

06:15.120 --> 06:19.670
And I think I'm ready for everything
else, but I'm a little bit nervous.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.310
More than a little bit, actually.

06:22.360 --> 06:26.030
I remember that feeling.
You do know there's no need?

06:26.080 --> 06:27.950
I've just got so much to learn.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.310
And you will... because
of what's in here.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.590
That's the bit you've
got to be sure of.

06:33.640 --> 06:37.040
If you're sure of that, there's
plenty of help with the rest.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.320
You just trust in God's guidance.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.840
I can't hear myself think!

07:41.400 --> 07:43.950
What do you think of that
racket then, Sister?

07:44.000 --> 07:47.700
Telling you, none of mine
ever made a din like that.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.360
Is this an inconvenient
time, Mr Prendergast?

07:52.760 --> 07:54.900
What can we do, Sister?

07:55.240 --> 07:57.640
He's like this night and day.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.840
How am I supposed to do a day's work?

08:05.800 --> 08:09.390
If it ain't the baby, it's
him! Bleedin' holy rollers.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.240
Not you, Sister.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.510
Mrs Prendergast?

08:20.560 --> 08:23.910
I've got to get this up. It's
going to stink in this weather.

08:23.960 --> 08:26.750
I'm so sorry, Sister. Ray
ain't coping too well

08:26.800 --> 08:30.110
~ with the lack of sleep.
~ There's time enough for that.

08:30.160 --> 08:35.960
Back to bed and let's see what this
little chap is complaining about.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.630
Still not settling, little man?

08:41.679 --> 08:44.590
Even when I feed him, he's
hardly quiet five minutes.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.670
~ I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
~ Probably nothing.

08:47.720 --> 08:51.000
Little Raymond does sound more
distressed than yesterday.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.470
Look at this.

08:55.520 --> 08:56.550
Can you see?

08:56.600 --> 08:58.950
It's very only slight, but
there's a bit of swelling.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.030
~ What's wrong with him?
~ I can't be sure without an X-ray,

09:02.080 --> 09:04.670
but I think Raymond might
have a broken collar bone.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.310
~ What?
~ It happens during some births.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.790
Not many, but more than
you might imagine.

09:08.840 --> 09:12.110
Sometimes, it's pronounced
and you can see it right away,

09:12.160 --> 09:13.750
but not always.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.550
Did I do something wrong?

09:15.600 --> 09:19.110
~ Like, push too hard?
~ No, of course not. It's no-one's fault.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.830
The important thing
is to get an X-ray.

09:21.880 --> 09:26.600
If it is a fracture, babies'
bones heal quickly.

10:10.280 --> 10:13.840
This is a happy day,
Sister Mary Cynthia.

10:15.840 --> 10:16.990
Welcome home.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.390
Thank you, Sister Julienne.

10:19.440 --> 10:22.670
Our Sisters have been very much looking
forward to your joining us.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.550
Sister Monica Joan
will be disappointed

10:24.600 --> 10:27.950
this particular week is
her time with her nephew.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.400
I've missed her. I've missed
you all. And the patients.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.150
I'm sure you're looking forward
to returning to midwifery,

10:36.200 --> 10:37.990
but I would ask that you spend

10:38.040 --> 10:41.360
the initial few weeks
on the district rota.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.430
Oh.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.550
I think that midnight call-outs,
in addition to studies,

10:46.600 --> 10:48.740
might be rather onerous.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.910
Of course, Sister.

10:50.960 --> 10:54.560
I've missed all our patients,
not just the mothers.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.120
I'm on first call!

11:00.720 --> 11:02.120
Cynthia!

11:03.320 --> 11:08.670
I mean, not Cynthia. I mean,
hello, Sister Mary Cynthia.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.670
Hello, Trixie.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.870
You should have told
us you were coming!

11:12.920 --> 11:15.240
I didn't want a fuss.

11:16.520 --> 11:17.990
Of course.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.630
You look very well.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.320
Thank you.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.150
Well... I should go.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.940
Yes, of course.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.220
We're all thrilled to have you home.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.350
~ Oh, Mrs Thompson.
~ Thank you.

11:51.400 --> 11:55.000
Do you know if we have an Indian
lady registered with us?

11:56.720 --> 11:58.950
Not as far as I know.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.070
No. I didn't think so.

12:03.480 --> 12:08.310
Here we are. We chose this room
because it's the quietest.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.950
We thought it might help
you with your devotions.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.510
Thank you, Sister. That's
very considerate.

12:13.560 --> 12:18.800
I'll leave you alone until Compline,
but if you need anything, I'm just...

12:34.560 --> 12:37.230
Nurse Mount, you are on district,

12:37.280 --> 12:41.190
as is Sister Mary Cynthia,
who I assume

12:41.240 --> 12:43.950
~ doesn't need anyone to show her the ropes?
~ I should say not.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.270
I don't think I've been away
long enough to lose my way

12:47.320 --> 12:50.830
~ in Poplar.
~ Jolly good, though you will be travelling

12:50.880 --> 12:53.990
a little further afield
today, courtesy of a batch

12:54.040 --> 12:57.950
of Dr Greenwood's patients,
including a gentleman recovering

12:58.000 --> 13:01.110
from diphtheria, who is very
underweight and will require

13:01.160 --> 13:02.150
some Benger's Food.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.830
Goodness, diphtheria. You don't
often hear of that these days.

13:05.880 --> 13:09.070
Indeed. An isolated case, I believe.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.790
Nevertheless, in order
to keep it that way,

13:11.840 --> 13:14.030
we should all be
particularly vigilant

13:14.080 --> 13:18.150
about hand hygiene. And any patients
with coughs and sneezes,

13:18.200 --> 13:20.830
we shouldn't automatically
assume it's a summer cold.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.710
Double check that they
have the immunisation.

13:23.760 --> 13:28.150
~ Complacency seems to be slipping in.
~ Absolutely.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.590
Better safe than sorry.
It's an awful way to go.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.270
~ I remember it from the war.
~ Gosh. It's one of those things

13:34.320 --> 13:36.950
~ I've only read about.
~ The thing I remember most

13:37.000 --> 13:39.390
was the dreadful smell.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.950
You know, from the nosebleeds.
It seemed to get into everything.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.350
That doesn't really come
across in the textbooks.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.230
I'd say Dr Greenwood's patient's
very lucky to be alive.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.280
Good grief, it's hot.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.870
~ Ice creams, later?
~ Oh, yes, let's.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.750
Your trusty steed,
Sister Mary Cynthia.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.310
~ Cleaned, oiled and ready for action.
~ Thank you, Fred!

14:02.360 --> 14:04.910
Doesn't it look splendid?

14:04.960 --> 14:07.590
Now I just have to work out
how to ride it in a habit.

14:07.640 --> 14:08.780
Oh.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.510
Glad I've got you to
keep me right, Fred.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.910
Nah, you don't need me, Sister.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.030
You're going to be
absolutely smashing.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.020
~ Ready, Sister?
~ Yes.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.790
Going our way, Barbara?

14:29.840 --> 14:32.990
What? Oh. No, I'm not.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.110
I'll see you at lunch.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.510
Her name is Ameera Khatun

14:51.560 --> 14:56.510
and this is the address. I can
let Faruk know to expect you.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.830
I would go after school,
until the end of term,

14:58.880 --> 15:00.870
as you'll need him to translate.

15:00.920 --> 15:04.190
Luckily, we've only a few days to go.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.780
Thank you so much, Miss Dawkins.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.830
I'm glad you're going to see her.
She does seem rather isolated.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.110
I think her husband
works very long hours.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.150
I can't imagine what it must be like,

15:16.200 --> 15:18.350
to leave everything behind,

15:18.400 --> 15:21.230
to come to a country where
you can't understand anyone.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.150
I mean, India to Poplar.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.710
Oh, they're not Indian, actually,
Nurse Gilbert, they're Sylheti.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.710
Oh. Thank you for telling me.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.960
I wouldn't want to get
off on the wrong foot.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.870
My goodness, what a magnificent pram.

15:39.920 --> 15:43.360
Ray got it yesterday. Nothing
but the best for his boy.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.270
Poor little soldier.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.150
He's still quite unsettled, isn't he?

15:49.200 --> 15:51.070
The paracetamol should have helped.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.350
When was his last dose?

15:53.400 --> 15:55.310
Janice?

15:55.360 --> 15:59.150
~ We're praying for him, all the time.
~ I'm sure you are,

15:59.200 --> 16:01.750
but Raymond has a fracture.

16:01.800 --> 16:05.670
I know that Christian Science allows
for the treatment of broken bones.

16:05.720 --> 16:09.470
~ You have to give him the medicine.
~ Bone setting's acceptable,

16:09.520 --> 16:11.190
but we don't have faith in medicines.

16:11.240 --> 16:14.920
The Christian Science way
out of pain is prayer.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.710
I am the last person in the world
who would come between people

16:18.760 --> 16:22.920
and their faith, but Raymond
is a tiny baby and is in pain.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.200
It's in our book.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.950
"Either Spirit or matter
is your model.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.070
"If you try to have two models,
then you practically have none."

16:39.120 --> 16:41.310
You see? Medicine could
interfere with the prayers.

16:41.360 --> 16:45.630
Janice, those are your
beliefs, they're not mine.

16:45.680 --> 16:48.750
Why don't I give Raymond his medicine

16:48.800 --> 16:51.200
and then we'll pray together?

17:03.200 --> 17:04.720
This way.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.760
This is our room.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.780
Oh!

17:24.400 --> 17:27.270
She says, please come
in and sit down.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.480
Don't you...?

17:42.680 --> 17:47.510
Mrs Khatun, my name is Nurse Gilbert
and I help look after women

17:47.560 --> 17:49.760
who are expecting babies.

17:50.840 --> 17:53.630
Amar thai nam Nurse Gilbert.

17:53.680 --> 17:58.240
Thai betin te bacha hoibo,
thara re shajo kori.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.070
I wondered what your plans
were for when your baby comes?

18:03.120 --> 18:06.470
Do you have someone to
help with the birth?

18:06.520 --> 18:11.590
Bachha aiya harle kita korbe?
Tomar shajo korbo manush assai?

18:11.640 --> 18:14.350
Thai're ko, tomar bafhe
sopbta kichu korbo.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.360
My father is sorting out everything.

18:19.160 --> 18:22.150
In England, midwives like me, help.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.710
We deliver many, many
babies. Mrs Khatun,

18:25.760 --> 18:29.030
there is so much we can do. If you
were to come along to the clinic,

18:29.080 --> 18:31.750
you could see a midwife and a doctor.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.270
We can check the baby and help
with the pain when you walk.

18:34.320 --> 18:38.350
We can help with the birth
and after. All free.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.190
Oh, sorry, I'm talking too fast.
Can you translate all that?

18:41.240 --> 18:43.200
Of course.

18:49.640 --> 18:53.950
Are you sure you won't come?
It's such a glorious evening.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.230
Barbara's coming. And Delia.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.670
I think there is going to be music.

18:58.720 --> 19:02.320
I'm sure it will be lovely,
but I'd like to get this done.

19:05.520 --> 19:10.270
~ There you are!
~ Sorry. I got back late.
I found my Sylheti lady.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.830
I think she's going
to come to the clinic.

19:12.880 --> 19:16.360
Good Nancy Drewing, Barbara.
I'm glad you found her. Come on.

19:18.920 --> 19:22.020
We'll bring you back
some pork scratchings.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.830
Faruk?

21:14.150 --> 21:15.150
Here you go.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.000
This way, please.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.110
Everything seems to be going
very well, Mrs Khatun.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.470
I don't think we have many more
weeks to wait for this baby.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.350
Sopbta tik assai, baccha ai' bo.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.070
~ Inshallah.
~ God willing.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.670
Are you finished?

21:35.720 --> 21:40.630
Nearly. Nurse Gilbert, could
you pop in for a moment?

21:40.680 --> 21:42.430
Yes?

21:42.480 --> 21:46.180
(I can't do an internal
examination without asking.)

21:47.600 --> 21:49.190
Oh.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.110
Quite. I think we'll
have to leave it.

21:53.680 --> 21:57.790
Do you have any female friends
who speak English, Mrs Khatun?

21:57.840 --> 22:00.550
It might help for the
examination next time.

22:00.600 --> 22:01.910
She doesn't.

22:01.960 --> 22:05.390
What about the other people
who live in your house, Faruk?

22:05.440 --> 22:07.230
~ No ladies?
~ No.

22:07.280 --> 22:12.310
Other women stay in our village,
if the men have to come to England,

22:12.360 --> 22:14.590
but my mother said she would
miss my father too much.

22:14.640 --> 22:18.440
She says, "Where he goes,
we go. Even the moon."

22:31.120 --> 22:33.990
Faruk, will you tell your mum
I have something that will

22:34.040 --> 22:36.440
help the pain when she walks.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.390
Trixie.

23:08.440 --> 23:11.110
I'm sorry. I've been avoiding you.

23:13.680 --> 23:16.790
If it would make things easier,
I could speak to the Bishop.

23:16.840 --> 23:19.350
~ Try to move parish sooner.
~ No!

23:19.400 --> 23:21.830
That's just it. You should
be wherever you want,

23:21.880 --> 23:26.950
wherever you need to be, whether
it's here or Newcastle or...

23:27.000 --> 23:28.670
even the moon.

23:31.480 --> 23:35.180
You deserve a girl who won't
let you go without her.

23:36.360 --> 23:38.830
I rather thought I'd found her.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.760
Yes, well...

23:41.200 --> 23:43.400
.. so did I, for a while.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.540
You're a wonderful man, Tom.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.350
You can't bring the
pram in, I'm afraid.

24:05.400 --> 24:09.790
~ Oh, er, is Sister Julienne here?
~ Not today, sorry.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.640
Let me help you.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.350
Oh, someone's not very
happy, are they?

24:16.400 --> 24:18.390
He started crying as soon
as we left the house.

24:18.440 --> 24:21.640
I think there's something
wrong with his leg.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.990
You were right. No movement
in the leg at all.

24:30.040 --> 24:36.590
And a lot of heat. I'm
sorry, Mrs Prendergast.

24:36.640 --> 24:40.190
I'm afraid Raymond is going to
need another trip to hospital.

24:40.240 --> 24:43.710
~ What is it? What's wrong with him?
~ Try not to move him before

24:43.760 --> 24:46.960
~ the ambulance gets here. Just in case.
~ Just in case, what?

24:48.120 --> 24:50.790
Just in case it's another fracture.

25:00.710 --> 25:01.710
Ah!!

25:01.760 --> 25:04.630
It seemed to go well with
Mrs Khatun, Barbara?

25:04.680 --> 25:05.870
It's totally inappropriate

25:05.920 --> 25:09.310
to have a nine-year-old boy
in an intimate examination.

25:09.360 --> 25:11.700
He wasn't actually in there.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.830
It wasn't easy though, Barbara.
The examination was incomplete.

25:16.880 --> 25:19.350
Well, he certainly can't
be present at the birth.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.400
The husband, perhaps?

25:21.800 --> 25:24.270
We need someone to communicate.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.590
What about old, er,
whatsisname? Suleman.

25:27.640 --> 25:31.270
Used to have the buttons and
bows shop before he died?

25:31.320 --> 25:34.720
We need someone female, Fred.
And preferably alive(!)

25:37.680 --> 25:39.390
Do you mean his wife?

25:39.440 --> 25:41.910
He married an Irish girl.
They had a daughter.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.230
The daughter speaks Sylheti?

25:43.280 --> 25:45.640
~ Oh!
~ Fred?

25:47.800 --> 25:51.560
~ I dunno. You'll have to ask her.
~ Have a seat. What have you done?
~ Oh!

25:59.040 --> 26:02.040
This was it. Ah, it's
changed a bit, mind.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.870
Sorry to bother you.
Old Suleman's daughter

26:04.920 --> 26:06.910
still lives round here, doesn't she?

26:06.960 --> 26:09.470
Josie? Yeah. Number 16.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.660
Thank you. Thanks, Fred.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.710
Oh, I'll have a packet of those
shirt buttons, while I'm here.

26:15.760 --> 26:18.230
Keep popping, for some reason.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.190
No-one tell you the war's over?

26:22.240 --> 26:25.590
Cold War isn't. CDC. Very Important.

26:25.640 --> 26:30.670
~ I suppose it is.
~ You should stick one
of these in your window.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.390
Maybe, I will.

26:33.400 --> 26:34.670
All's welcome.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.560
Ladies, too.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.590
Ta, for these.

26:48.880 --> 26:52.030
I don't think I'm very good.
I haven't spoken Sylheti

26:52.080 --> 26:55.550
since my dad died and I think
he used to humour me.

26:55.600 --> 26:58.510
Well, you'll be better than me.
Will you come to the clinic

26:58.560 --> 27:00.990
~ and give it a go?
~ I could try.

27:01.040 --> 27:04.880
~ I'd like to help her. I
know it was hard for my dad.
~ Thank you.

27:11.080 --> 27:13.310
So, in your view, this
couldn't possibly

27:13.360 --> 27:15.430
have been an accident?

27:18.280 --> 27:21.070
How can there be another
fracture, Ray? He was fine.

27:21.120 --> 27:25.270
~ How can this be happening?
~ Shh, love.

27:25.320 --> 27:26.720
I dunno.

27:27.920 --> 27:31.270
The hospital doctors seem as baffled
as the rest of us by this.

27:31.320 --> 27:34.830
They are going to want to
ask you if you have any idea

27:34.880 --> 27:38.430
~ how this could have happened.
~ We've already told them, we don't know.

27:38.480 --> 27:43.000
But if you CAN think of
anything, anything at all.

27:44.360 --> 27:48.870
It's a serious fracture. Unusual,
in a baby of this age

27:48.920 --> 27:53.990
and it's very hard to imagine how
this could've happened unnoticed.

27:54.040 --> 27:58.110
~ What are you saying, exactly?
~ I'm not saying anything, Mr Prendergast.

27:58.160 --> 28:00.680
I'm trying to help you...

28:01.680 --> 28:03.620
.. and help Raymond.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.430
We have to get to the bottom of this,

28:08.480 --> 28:10.910
so if there was any
kind of accident...

28:10.960 --> 28:14.510
Oh, I see what this is about! You
think we're hiding something.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.350
~ No!
~ You think it's our fault!
~ That isn't what I said.

28:17.400 --> 28:21.390
But that's what you
think! I can see it.

28:24.440 --> 28:26.720
We love our baby, Doctor.

28:36.520 --> 28:40.110
It's not the sort of injury one
would associate with slipping

28:40.160 --> 28:43.230
with the baby or dropping
him in the bath.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.840
It's like something you could
see after a car accident...

28:48.240 --> 28:50.390
.. or some other great force.

28:50.440 --> 28:51.920
Such as?

28:53.400 --> 28:55.340
Such as, an assault.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.270
I see.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.870
~ Do you think that's what happened?
~ I don't know.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.720
I find the idea almost inconceivable.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.990
The baby must have
been in terrible pain.

29:13.040 --> 29:16.110
Sister, are you absolutely convinced

29:16.160 --> 29:18.790
that the first fracture
was a birth injury?

29:18.840 --> 29:22.630
It seemed the most likely
scenario, at the time.

29:22.680 --> 29:24.080
And now?

29:25.440 --> 29:28.440
We must be wary of jumping
to conclusions.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.910
I agree. I do.

29:30.960 --> 29:33.230
Nevertheless, we have a tiny baby

29:33.280 --> 29:35.620
with two painful fractures.

29:36.520 --> 29:40.160
Could we live with ourselves
if he were to sustain a third?

29:42.520 --> 29:44.460
What do you suggest?

29:45.440 --> 29:48.160
That we speak to the NSPCC.

30:02.160 --> 30:06.630
~ What's going on?
~ Take a seat, please, Mr and Mrs Prendergast.

30:06.680 --> 30:11.550
~ Where's our baby?
~ Here, in the hospital, Mrs Prendergast,

30:11.600 --> 30:14.590
and as comfortable
as can be expected.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.630
Let me introduce myself.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.830
My name is Mr Smith-Mayhew

30:18.880 --> 30:21.070
and I'm an inspector with
the National Society

30:21.120 --> 30:24.600
~ for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
~ What?

30:25.560 --> 30:28.750
It was him, wasn't
it? I told you, love.

30:28.800 --> 30:31.390
I told you he thought
we'd done something.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.550
~ We would never hurt our baby.
~ Sit down, please.

30:33.600 --> 30:36.390
No-one is accusing you of
anything, at the moment.

30:36.440 --> 30:37.710
I want to see my baby.

30:37.760 --> 30:39.870
~ Mrs Prendergast...
~ Don't you touch her!

30:39.920 --> 30:43.200
~ I want to see my little boy...
~ Mrs Prendergast!

30:53.560 --> 30:55.950
~ Excuse me, it's not visiting time!
~ Where is he?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.550
What have you done with
my baby? Where is he?

30:58.600 --> 31:01.030
He's on a different ward.
Janice, we have to find out

31:01.080 --> 31:06.070
what happened to him. The
NSPCC have a court order.

31:06.120 --> 31:09.910
I'm sorry, but until they can
be satisfied that your home

31:09.960 --> 31:14.460
is a safe place, Raymond is going
to be removed from your care.

31:25.120 --> 31:27.630
That's a good strong
heartbeat, Mrs Khatun.

31:27.680 --> 31:30.680
~ Bachhar jaan assai, Khatun.
~ Al hamdulila.

31:31.200 --> 31:35.230
~ Tomar bafor bari ami jani.
~ Ji oi.

31:35.280 --> 31:39.080
She thinks she knows the
village my father came from.

31:39.560 --> 31:42.030
I'd like to do an internal
examination now.

31:42.080 --> 31:44.150
Can you ask her if that's all right?

31:44.200 --> 31:51.270
~ Ameera? Ameera?
~ Palong aram assai, amar gom laghbe,

31:51.320 --> 31:53.350
amar bacacha oi bo!

31:53.400 --> 31:56.830
She says the bed's comfortable
and she is pregnant,

31:56.880 --> 31:59.680
so she might be about to fall asleep.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.040
Possibly not.

32:06.440 --> 32:09.040
You have visitors, Nurse Gilbert.

32:10.760 --> 32:11.950
Hello!

32:12.000 --> 32:17.030
My mother made you some samosas,
to say thank you for your kindness.

32:17.080 --> 32:18.390
Oh, my goodness, how kind!

32:18.440 --> 32:22.830
Thai're ko, ami sop masala
fi si na, kinto igo tik oi bo.

32:22.880 --> 32:26.590
She says she couldn't
get all the same spices,

32:26.640 --> 32:29.640
~ but they still should be good.
~ Isn't he sweet?

32:33.520 --> 32:35.990
How's the walking? The garment?

32:36.640 --> 32:41.670
Haarhte tomar orshobida oi ni? Kapra
findia tomar shajo oi say ni?

32:41.720 --> 32:45.390
Ji oi. Sopkichu bala korshor.

32:45.440 --> 32:50.120
Ami tomari danyabad ditheysai, amar
bishbala tumi amar shajo korso.

32:52.000 --> 32:57.270
~ Beti manush ekano nai.
~ She says it helps a great deal,

32:57.320 --> 32:59.990
but she says she is not only
thanking you for helping

33:00.040 --> 33:03.160
with the pain, she also has missed
the companionship of other women.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.990
~ What is it?
~ Should we try them?

33:16.040 --> 33:19.550
On the Sub-Continent, they eat
everything with their fingers.

33:19.600 --> 33:23.800
Right hand only, of course. The left
has quite a different purpose.

33:25.320 --> 33:28.910
~ Pass them down.
~ Would love to try, thank you.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.960
What are they called?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.670
Did you do something that hurt him?

33:47.120 --> 33:48.990
Did you get angry?

33:58.000 --> 33:59.600
I'm so sorry.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.230
I don't...

34:02.280 --> 34:04.220
I don't know why...

34:33.400 --> 34:34.800
Patrick?

34:37.199 --> 34:42.800
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake
you. I couldn't sleep.

34:44.520 --> 34:47.199
Poor you. You had an awful day.

34:48.560 --> 34:51.030
These things are awful,

34:51.080 --> 34:54.280
even when you know it's
the right thing to do.

34:55.920 --> 34:59.000
How could anyone hurt a tiny baby?

35:01.800 --> 35:04.880
But he's safe tonight, thanks to you.

35:24.240 --> 35:27.240
I'm keeping it for
when we get him back.

35:28.960 --> 35:32.280
They looking after him
right, those fosterers?

35:33.280 --> 35:34.480
Yes.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.310
He is very well cared for.

35:38.360 --> 35:41.360
But they don't love him.
Not like I love him.

35:43.680 --> 35:46.470
He's got to come back, Sister.
I've been praying so hard.

35:46.520 --> 35:50.990
Janice, the only way Raymond can
come back is if you can explain

35:51.040 --> 35:55.910
how these fractures happened. You
have to prove you can keep him safe.

35:55.960 --> 36:01.000
But I don't know. I've thought
of everything over and over again.

36:02.720 --> 36:05.630
Ray's been out fighting, like he
used to, before we found our Church.

36:05.680 --> 36:08.310
Last night, he came
back with a black eye

36:08.360 --> 36:13.110
and I know he ain't been going to
work. I keep trying to pray it out,

36:13.160 --> 36:16.460
but where's God when you
need him, eh, Sister?

36:20.160 --> 36:23.190
Can I see Dr Turner, please?
I don't have an appointment.

36:23.240 --> 36:26.790
The surgery is actually closing
now, I can make one for tomorrow.

36:26.840 --> 36:30.550
No, please. It's the baby. I'm
not his mother. I'm Joyce Bishop,

36:30.600 --> 36:33.600
I foster. This is
Raymond Prendergast.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.750
We've been so careful with
this baby, Dr Turner,

36:41.800 --> 36:43.750
especially with his injuries.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.190
I've been fostering for 15 years,

36:46.240 --> 36:49.950
but every time I pick him up,
he screams. And have a look,

36:50.000 --> 36:53.030
there is a lump on his back.

36:53.080 --> 36:56.080
I've never felt anything
like it, Doctor.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.420
A fracture.

37:00.040 --> 37:04.520
~ We honestly have not done...
~ No, of course not, Mrs Bishop.

37:12.960 --> 37:16.060
The fontanelle is bigger
than it should be.

37:17.520 --> 37:18.870
Bear with me, please.

37:18.920 --> 37:22.160
This is so rare, I want
to check something.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.710
~ Shelagh, we're going to need an ambulance.
~ Of course.

37:26.760 --> 37:29.190
What are you thinking?

37:29.240 --> 37:32.150
Osteogenesis imperfecta -

37:32.200 --> 37:34.480
brittle bone disease.

37:35.920 --> 37:39.020
How could I not have
thought of this before?

38:01.760 --> 38:05.840
♪ Blessed is he whose
transgression is forgiven

38:07.320 --> 38:10.960
♪ And whose sin is covered

38:13.120 --> 38:15.030
♪ Blessed is the man

38:15.080 --> 38:20.960
♪ Unto whom the Lord
imputeth not iniquity

38:23.960 --> 38:28.550
♪ In whose spirit there
is no guile... ♪

39:40.360 --> 39:41.760
Patrick?

40:04.040 --> 40:07.470
Do you know the things
we've been called?

40:07.520 --> 40:10.270
~ The things people have done?
~ Ray, love, we're getting

40:10.320 --> 40:13.030
~ our baby boy back. That's
all that matters now.
~ No, it isn't!

40:13.080 --> 40:15.910
What matters is they took him!
He's supposed to be a doctor

40:15.960 --> 40:19.240
and he's too busy blaming us
to even notice Raymond was sick!

40:22.200 --> 40:26.950
Mr Prendergast, osteogenesis
is an extremely rare disease.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
~ Dr Turner was the first
person to suspect it.
~ Sister...

40:32.360 --> 40:33.960
Eventually.

40:37.640 --> 40:41.270
If you're ready, I can
drive you to the hospital.

40:41.320 --> 40:44.320
No, thank you, Dr Turner.
We'd rather get the bus.

40:52.040 --> 40:56.150
The nurses gave me embrocation,
but it keeps happening.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.550
Well, let's have a look.

40:57.600 --> 41:01.680
It could be muscular or a disc.

41:02.960 --> 41:07.550
~ Waterworks all right?
~ Well, Doctor, you know,
for a man of my age...

41:07.600 --> 41:10.950
I just like to check, with back
pain, in case it's the kidneys.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.910
Absolutely, Doc. Don't want anything
sliding under the radar,

41:14.960 --> 41:17.510
as they used to say in the war,
whilst stuck in a dive bomber,

41:17.560 --> 41:20.830
giving Jerry what for
with the old ack-ack!

41:20.880 --> 41:24.200
Are you all right, Doc? You
don't seem quite yourself?

41:27.360 --> 41:30.080
Fred, would you give me a minute?

41:32.360 --> 41:33.830
Of course.

41:44.880 --> 41:47.590
You might want to go in there,
Mrs Turner. I think the doctor's

41:47.640 --> 41:50.740
looking a little under
the weather himself.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.880
What is it? What's wrong?

41:59.920 --> 42:01.520
I don't know.

42:04.040 --> 42:06.270
~ What if I miss something else?
~ Patrick...

42:06.320 --> 42:11.720
~ I should have thought of it. That baby.
~ You ask too much of yourself.

42:13.680 --> 42:16.360
I'll be all right. I'll...

42:19.160 --> 42:21.070
Send Fred back in, would you?

42:21.120 --> 42:23.120
No, Patrick. I won't.

42:24.240 --> 42:28.080
I'm closing the surgery now
and I'm taking you home.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.560
~ I've got all these patients!
~ Leave the patients to me.

42:55.920 --> 42:59.550
~ I'll pop in at lunchtime.
~ How will you cope on your own?

42:59.600 --> 43:01.150
I won't be alone.

43:01.200 --> 43:03.740
One of the nurses will be there.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.350
I'm letting people down...

43:06.400 --> 43:07.670
again.

43:08.600 --> 43:11.870
No, you aren't. You're not well.

43:11.920 --> 43:15.020
You're exhausted, but
you'll be better soon.

43:16.720 --> 43:19.590
I expect you're a
safer pair of hands.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.760
Try and get some rest.

43:35.960 --> 43:37.300
Janice.

43:38.560 --> 43:39.910
I can see you're busy.

43:39.960 --> 43:42.030
Should I come back another time?

43:42.080 --> 43:44.470
No, Sister, I'm leaving.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.910
Janice and I were praying
for Raymond's recovery

43:46.960 --> 43:51.790
~ and giving thanks for his return.
~ He's in all our prayers.

43:51.840 --> 43:53.110
Thank you for coming.

43:53.160 --> 43:54.500
Sister.

43:59.880 --> 44:02.950
I brought some towels
for extra padding.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.950
It's very good to see
him out of the hospital.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.400
We've been praying every day.

44:08.520 --> 44:11.710
I think he looks a little
better, don't you?

44:11.760 --> 44:15.830
Janice, they did explain the
prognosis for osteogenesis,

44:15.880 --> 44:17.670
didn't they?

44:17.720 --> 44:20.990
You do understand that Raymond
will never have a full recovery

44:21.040 --> 44:24.000
and will probably require
a wheelchair.

44:24.960 --> 44:27.630
He made the cripples walk, Sister.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.700
Indeed, he did.

44:34.840 --> 44:38.670
I nearly lost my faith when
my baby was taken from me,

44:38.720 --> 44:42.120
but I prayed and prayed
and he came back to me.

44:42.960 --> 44:45.360
I have to believe it, Sister.

44:53.640 --> 44:56.670
If everyone could just take a seat.

44:56.720 --> 44:58.790
I'm going to take your details and...

44:58.840 --> 45:01.870
~ When's Dr Turner going to be back, then?
~ When he's better.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.310
In the meantime,

45:03.360 --> 45:06.230
I am trying to find other doctors
for people who require them

45:06.280 --> 45:09.390
and anything more routine
- for example, sunburn -

45:09.440 --> 45:12.670
I can deal with myself.
Please, do sit down.

45:12.720 --> 45:15.790
I don't want my Geraldine being
seen by the receptionist!

45:15.840 --> 45:19.520
~ I'm a fully-qualified nurse.
~ You don't look like one.

45:21.200 --> 45:23.150
Reinforcements reporting
for duty, Ma'am.

45:23.200 --> 45:28.670
~ Thank you. Erm... Mr Harcourt.
~ Yes?
~ Could you go with Nurse Mount.

45:28.720 --> 45:33.870
Mr... Jessop, I'll see
you in the Maternity room.

45:33.920 --> 45:37.920
No, no, thanks, love. I'd rather
wait and see the nurse.

46:03.720 --> 46:05.390
Hello, Sister.

46:06.040 --> 46:08.840
I'm afraid I've come to ask a favour.

46:14.600 --> 46:17.000
Hopefully, it will fit.

46:19.400 --> 46:22.800
As long as it serves its
purpose, I don't mind.

46:23.160 --> 46:25.870
I hope I'm doing the right thing.

46:25.920 --> 46:29.160
~ I want to help him so much.
~ You are.

46:32.040 --> 46:33.470
I'm so afraid.

46:33.520 --> 46:36.400
I keep thinking about...

46:37.560 --> 46:39.870
.. the hospital, the war neurosis.

46:39.920 --> 46:42.750
What if the shellshock returns?

46:42.800 --> 46:47.430
What if it's happening again?
What if I can't get him back?

46:47.480 --> 46:49.420
Oh, my dear Shelagh.

46:50.760 --> 46:53.120
This is not the war.

46:54.440 --> 46:57.270
He seems to have lost
all belief in himself.

46:57.320 --> 47:02.030
But YOU believe in him and so
do we and so do many people.

47:02.080 --> 47:05.790
And you can help him understand that
and he will find it again in himself.

47:05.840 --> 47:08.390
Oh, I hope so, Sister.

47:08.440 --> 47:11.950
I was reminded today, from
the most unlikely source,

47:12.000 --> 47:15.200
of the power that is belief.

47:57.200 --> 47:58.940
Morning, Nurse.

47:59.640 --> 48:01.040
Morning.

48:03.040 --> 48:04.780
Morning, Nurse.

48:05.600 --> 48:08.200
~ Morning.
~ Morning, Nurse!
~ Hello.

48:09.800 --> 48:12.230
I'll have to get a doctor
for Mrs Anderson.

48:12.280 --> 48:15.480
Probably antibiotics
needed. Here's the list.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.840
~ Mary Walker?
~ Here.

48:20.520 --> 48:23.470
Oh, dear, you've been in
the wars, haven't you?

48:23.520 --> 48:26.120
Let's see if we can patch you up.

48:58.160 --> 49:00.600
~ Look.
~ There's been a few.

49:01.830 --> 49:02.830
How is he?

49:02.880 --> 49:06.990
~ Sleeping again. Is that good?
~ Think so, yes.

49:07.040 --> 49:09.390
Thank you for holding the fort.

49:09.440 --> 49:12.640
I don't mind. I just
want Dad to get better.

49:24.280 --> 49:26.030
Please come. My mother's very sick.

49:26.080 --> 49:28.630
~ She can't breathe.
~ Of course, I'll get my bag.

49:28.680 --> 49:31.670
~ Sister.
~ It's not the baby. Mrs Khatun is sick.

49:31.720 --> 49:35.310
Very sick. She was tired,
she had a cold, but now...

49:35.360 --> 49:37.500
~ Please, come.
~ Yes, yes.

50:47.640 --> 50:50.000
Nurses coming through.

50:52.160 --> 50:53.870
Nas aiche, amma.

50:53.920 --> 50:56.910
It is Sister Mary Cynthia
and Nurse Gilbert.

50:56.960 --> 50:59.700
We are here to take care of you now.

51:10.200 --> 51:12.560
Sister. It smells very bad.

51:16.440 --> 51:17.950
I'll call the ambulance.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.640
What is it?

51:20.600 --> 51:23.600
We think your mother may have
an illness called diphtheria.

51:24.960 --> 51:28.630
Is your father at work? Perhaps
you could ask one of those men

51:28.680 --> 51:30.620
to go and fetch him?

51:35.600 --> 51:37.990
There's a lot from allotments.
Gladioli from Mr Philips,

51:38.040 --> 51:41.270
Dahlias from Mr Albert
Henderson. Old Ernie Shaw

51:41.320 --> 51:46.550
sent some huge onions. Says if you
cut one and put it in your sick room,

51:46.600 --> 51:49.150
it will take away all the germs.

51:49.200 --> 51:51.430
Cake from Mrs B and
everyone at Nonnatus -

51:51.480 --> 51:53.430
afraid I had a bit of that -

51:53.480 --> 51:56.790
a lot of children have drawn
stuff or sent you their sweets.

51:56.840 --> 51:59.670
Some of them are a bit fuzzy, but
it's the thought that counts.

51:59.720 --> 52:01.870
The Paterson family
sent a packet of tea.

52:01.920 --> 52:04.990
Said they wished it could
have been more, after what

52:05.040 --> 52:08.190
you did for their Ida.
Let me get my notebook

52:08.240 --> 52:10.580
and I'll tell you the rest.

52:10.840 --> 52:12.750
They shouldn't do this.

52:12.800 --> 52:14.790
They can't afford it.

52:14.840 --> 52:19.070
Dad, they wanted to....
because they care.

52:19.120 --> 52:24.270
Because, whether or not you believe
it, you're a good doctor.

52:24.320 --> 52:27.520
If I'm half as good as you
one day, I will be proud.

52:34.360 --> 52:37.360
~ What time is it now?
~ It's been 20 minutes.

52:38.440 --> 52:40.180
Where are they?

52:41.520 --> 52:45.990
It's weaker and very rapid.
We can't wait much longer.

52:46.040 --> 52:47.710
Will you be all right?

52:47.760 --> 52:49.480
Go.

52:56.880 --> 53:01.390
I'm sorry, Timothy. I know he's
ill, but it's an emergency.

53:01.440 --> 53:03.350
~ I really need to see...
~ What is it, Sister?

53:03.400 --> 53:06.630
Ameera Khatun. Nine months
pregnant. Diphtheria.

53:06.680 --> 53:09.990
We have waited more than
20 minutes for an ambulance.

53:10.040 --> 53:13.240
Please, Doctor, she is
struggling to breathe.

53:14.760 --> 53:17.100
Sorry, Nurse. I need my bag.

53:17.840 --> 53:20.310
Let me get it for you, Doctor.

53:32.720 --> 53:36.270
Come on, Ameera, stay with me.

53:36.320 --> 53:39.590
I know you don't understand
me, but listen to my voice.

53:44.200 --> 53:47.630
Ah. Everything's all right.
The doctor's here now.

53:47.680 --> 53:52.110
Her temperature is 102 degrees. Her
pulse is 110 and her respirations

53:52.160 --> 53:54.750
are increasingly laboured
in the last 30 minutes.

53:54.800 --> 53:58.750
She needs a tracheotomy...

53:58.800 --> 54:00.910
~ now.
~ But the ambulance...

54:00.960 --> 54:05.280
~ No. I'm going to have to do it. Improvise.
~ Here?

54:08.640 --> 54:12.030
The airways are almost blocked.
We don't have a lot of time.

54:12.080 --> 54:14.200
Move her down the bed.

54:15.160 --> 54:17.790
Be ready to tie the
tube in place, Sister.

54:17.840 --> 54:20.960
Nurse Gilbert, can you prepare
the tapes and a dressing?

54:23.320 --> 54:25.520
One... two... three...

55:36.560 --> 55:38.230
There you are.

55:44.160 --> 55:46.030
Well done, Doctor.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.230
Thank you.

55:48.960 --> 55:52.830
Doctor... this is Mrs
Khatun's husband.

55:52.880 --> 55:56.390
~ He wants to go with her.
~ Soon. First, we have to vaccinate you

55:56.440 --> 56:01.030
and everyone else in the house. Sister,
can you get them all inside

56:01.080 --> 56:04.520
and keep them there until we're
done. Vaccines are on their way.

56:14.840 --> 56:16.040
Yes.

56:30.800 --> 56:33.470
I'll do that. You go home and rest.

56:33.880 --> 56:36.190
You're the one who should be resting.

56:36.240 --> 56:40.840
~ I left you in a terrible position.
~ No, you didn't. You were ill.

56:42.320 --> 56:45.720
~ You may not understand that, but...
~ I do.

56:48.400 --> 56:50.590
I couldn't then, but I do see it now.

56:50.640 --> 56:54.830
But there was a point
when I thought that...

56:54.880 --> 56:59.520
We're not at war now, Patrick.
It's not going to happen again.

57:01.080 --> 57:02.790
I know...
