00:02.068 --> 00:04.448
[suspenseful music playing]

00:10.793 --> 00:12.068
[Parker]
History is full of miners

00:12.068 --> 00:14.172
who made a lot of money

00:15.724 --> 00:18.172
but didn't know when to walk
away and lost it all.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.965
Some of us will survive
and some won't.

00:25.482 --> 00:26.793
[man] No, you [bleep] listen.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.620
You took something that
[bleep] belongs to me

00:28.620 --> 00:30.793
and I [bleep] want it back.

00:30.793 --> 00:34.482
[narrator] On the all new
season of Gold Rush...

00:34.482 --> 00:37.172
[dramatic music playing]

00:37.172 --> 00:39.896
Woo. Here we go.
We're back, baby.

00:39.896 --> 00:41.482
[narrator]
The balance of power

00:41.482 --> 00:43.482
in the Klondike is shifting.

00:43.482 --> 00:45.103
You just don't want it
to be your problem.

00:45.103 --> 00:47.482
[Tony speaking]

00:48.793 --> 00:49.724
[narrator] The Beets...

00:49.724 --> 00:51.103
[laughs]

00:51.103 --> 00:53.172
[narrator] ...aim for their
biggest season ever.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.137
[Tony speaking]

00:59.000 --> 01:00.172
[narrator]
But a rift in the family...

01:00.172 --> 01:02.103
You're spending,
spending, spending.

01:02.103 --> 01:03.172
There's nothing coming in.

01:03.172 --> 01:06.379
[narrator] ...threatens
to bring down the dynasty.

01:07.172 --> 01:08.172
[wire snaps]

01:08.896 --> 01:12.172
[Tony speaking]

01:13.275 --> 01:14.482
Everyone's expendable.

01:15.586 --> 01:17.103
-[man] Everyone.
-Ugh.

01:17.103 --> 01:19.000
He's kind of running
it into the ground.

01:23.275 --> 01:25.827
Jumping back in the seat.
It feels good.

01:25.827 --> 01:29.896
[narrator] Rick Ness battles
back from rock bottom.

01:29.896 --> 01:31.103
[Rick]
I need a thousand ounces

01:31.103 --> 01:33.000
to get my life on track.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.793
[Parker] I know we've had
our differences,

01:34.793 --> 01:37.586
but I do wanna see
you make this work.

01:37.586 --> 01:38.620
[narrator] On a quest...

01:38.620 --> 01:40.275
[man] Right now,
the name of the game is gold.

01:40.275 --> 01:42.896
[narrator] ...to put his life
back together...

01:42.896 --> 01:44.068
It's the beginning
of my new chapter.

01:44.586 --> 01:46.275
[bleep].

01:46.275 --> 01:48.448
In layman's terms,
she's [bleep].

01:50.517 --> 01:52.586
Dude, this is nothing.

01:52.586 --> 01:55.378
[narrator]
...and strike it rich.

01:55.378 --> 01:57.620
[Rick] A lot of people didn't
think I'd ever have another
gold way again.

01:57.620 --> 01:58.965
Turns out they were wrong.

02:02.103 --> 02:03.758
We'd need to do 5,000 ounces.

02:05.827 --> 02:06.931
[narrator] Parker Schnabel...

02:06.931 --> 02:08.517
[Parker] This is
[bleep] sick.

02:08.517 --> 02:11.068
[narrator] ...makes
a life-changing gamble...

02:12.379 --> 02:14.517
I can do it however
the [bleep] I want.

02:14.517 --> 02:16.482
[man] I don't know what's
going through the boy's head,

02:17.793 --> 02:20.344
but he does come up
with some great ideas.

02:21.896 --> 02:24.172
We have to be 100%
on our game.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.724
We're in the money
pit right now here.

02:26.724 --> 02:28.620
[narrator] That could
make him wealthy

02:28.620 --> 02:31.482
beyond his wildest dreams...

02:31.482 --> 02:32.482
[man] First gold
of the season.

02:32.482 --> 02:33.620
Yeah, there you go.

02:33.620 --> 02:36.379
[narrator] ...or wipe him out
completely.

02:36.379 --> 02:38.172
When there's $15 million
on the line,

02:38.172 --> 02:39.896
I don't think
you can trust anybody.

02:39.896 --> 02:43.034
[dramatic music playing]

02:49.896 --> 02:53.448
[upbeat music playing]

03:01.103 --> 03:03.551
[Parker] In this business,
you grow or you die.

03:06.103 --> 03:09.206
Do you play it safe and
downsize and spend less money,

03:09.206 --> 03:11.965
or do we go big?

03:12.724 --> 03:14.896
[narrator]
28-year-old mine boss

03:14.896 --> 03:18.137
Parker Schnabel
is at a turning point.

03:19.172 --> 03:20.724
And I don't want to downsize,
you know?

03:20.724 --> 03:23.310
We've spent so many years
building up to

03:23.310 --> 03:25.896
a size of company
where I really enjoy it.

03:25.896 --> 03:27.655
We make good money.

03:29.379 --> 03:30.586
You've gotta go where
the gold is.

03:30.586 --> 03:31.793
The Yukon is the place to be.

03:31.793 --> 03:35.586
[narrator] A decade ago,
18-year-old Parker

03:35.586 --> 03:38.206
came to the historic
gold fields...

03:38.206 --> 03:40.793
[Parker] If I want to play
with the big boys,

03:40.793 --> 03:43.586
we gotta get up here
where the big boys play.

03:43.586 --> 03:45.862
[narrator] ...with a dream
of striking
it rich...

03:47.689 --> 03:50.067
...and building
a mining empire.

03:50.067 --> 03:52.172
[Tony speaking]

03:52.930 --> 03:54.689
[narrator] In just 10 years,

03:54.689 --> 03:59.275
he's hauled in over
$100 million in gold...

03:59.275 --> 04:01.000
[man] Collectively
in your career,

04:01.000 --> 04:04.275
you have now exceeded
50,000 ounces of gold.

04:04.275 --> 04:05.379
[Parker] Wow.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.172
[narrator]
...becoming one of the biggest

04:07.172 --> 04:10.241
gold producers in the Yukon.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.413
In the process,

04:13.413 --> 04:17.000
he's chewed through
thousands of acres of ground.

04:17.724 --> 04:20.103
Last year,
we did a ton of gold

04:20.103 --> 04:23.172
and mined a lot of ground,
and it was going really good.

04:23.172 --> 04:25.482
But after 10 years
on the Indian River,

04:25.482 --> 04:27.068
we're done there.
The license is over.

04:28.103 --> 04:31.482
[narrator] To keep producing
record-breaking seasons,

04:31.482 --> 04:36.379
Parker needs gold-rich ground
big enough for his operation,

04:36.379 --> 04:38.758
or he'll be forced
to scale back.

04:40.379 --> 04:42.275
[Parker] We have some
big decisions to make.

04:43.275 --> 04:45.793
Do we gamble
on some new ground

04:45.793 --> 04:48.931
and keep taking big risks?

04:48.931 --> 04:50.517
We have the equipment,
we have the people,

04:50.517 --> 04:52.103
we have the mechanics,
we have the wash plants,

04:52.103 --> 04:55.482
we have the knowledge,
but really only thing

04:55.482 --> 04:57.896
that matters is the ground.

05:00.103 --> 05:03.275
I signed a deal on this
ground on Australia Creek.

05:04.172 --> 05:06.689
[narrator] To keep his mining
career going,

05:06.689 --> 05:09.172
Parker's targeting
one of the last blocks

05:09.172 --> 05:11.482
of virgin ground
in the area...

05:12.000 --> 05:13.586
Australia Creek.

05:13.586 --> 05:15.586
[dramatic music playing]

05:18.482 --> 05:20.620
[narrator] When gold was
discovered in the Klondike

05:20.620 --> 05:22.586
in 1896,

05:22.586 --> 05:24.275
miners flooded the valleys

05:24.275 --> 05:27.000
and creeks seeking
their fortunes.

05:28.517 --> 05:32.068
But 50 miles southeast
of Dawson City,

05:32.068 --> 05:35.000
and two miles
from Parker's old claims,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.172
the old timers skipped over

05:37.172 --> 05:39.379
a huge block of ground,

05:39.379 --> 05:43.689
8,500 acres
on Australia Creek.

05:45.793 --> 05:48.379
One hundred and twenty-five
years later,

05:48.379 --> 05:50.724
with few options
to choose from,

05:50.724 --> 05:53.275
Parker's secured
an exclusive lease

05:53.275 --> 05:56.413
to mine this unproven ground.

05:56.413 --> 06:00.482
It's kind of a seller's market
and I'm a buyer, right?

06:00.482 --> 06:01.724
Gold prices are high.

06:01.724 --> 06:04.896
So everybody's asking
for high royalties.

06:04.896 --> 06:06.689
[narrator] Parker has to pay
the owners

06:06.689 --> 06:11.310
a 20% royalty
on any gold he finds.

06:11.310 --> 06:14.793
But before he moves
his entire operation,

06:14.793 --> 06:16.310
he first has to find out

06:16.310 --> 06:20.586
if the ground is worth
pouring millions into mining.

06:20.586 --> 06:22.896
[Parker] We don't really know
much about it.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.586
If the gold's not there,

06:24.586 --> 06:27.068
you get in real trouble
real fast.

06:34.275 --> 06:38.000
So this is like a map
with the drill results.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.068
Sonic Results Australia Creek.

06:41.103 --> 06:43.000
[narrator] Parker's only clue

06:43.000 --> 06:45.586
are the test drill results.

06:45.586 --> 06:47.275
Like a treasure map,

06:47.275 --> 06:50.413
they should indicate
where the best gold lies

06:50.413 --> 06:52.586
beneath the ground.

06:52.586 --> 06:55.103
There's some really good
drilling in here actually.

06:55.103 --> 06:56.896
There's a lot of bad
ones as well.

06:56.896 --> 06:58.827
So, we just have to be bang on

06:58.827 --> 07:01.172
because if you put the pit in
the wrong spot in...

07:01.172 --> 07:03.482
On ground like this,
you'd go broke.

07:03.482 --> 07:06.655
[upbeat guitar music playing]

07:07.413 --> 07:09.103
[narrator]
To find the best spot

07:09.103 --> 07:11.068
to start digging for gold,

07:11.068 --> 07:13.965
Parker brings in
team member Tyson Lee.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.275
[Parker] There's a drill
hole right there.

07:16.275 --> 07:18.068
-[Tyson] Yup.
-[Parker] That looks
like it's in a swamp.

07:18.068 --> 07:19.689
[Tyson] Yup.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.827
[Parker] Do we wanna walk
through the [bleep] snow?

07:21.827 --> 07:23.000
[Tyson] Let's get after it.

07:23.793 --> 07:27.206
[guitar music playing]

07:27.206 --> 07:28.758
[Parker] Okay.
So what does this say?

07:29.379 --> 07:30.793
It doesn't look like much.

07:30.793 --> 07:32.241
Well, it's ripped
in [bleep] half.

07:33.103 --> 07:35.068
Hmm, 76?

07:35.068 --> 07:36.896
[Tyson] It looks like it.

07:38.275 --> 07:40.275
[Parker]
There's no 76 on this list.

07:40.275 --> 07:41.379
Uh, okay.

07:41.379 --> 07:44.482
Maybe they just [bleep]
up on that tag.

07:50.103 --> 07:53.793
This should be hole 81?

07:53.793 --> 07:56.551
You're a ways off.
This one's 26, man.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.241
Like, what good is this?

08:01.275 --> 08:02.689
Like, the [bleep] are you
supposed to do with that

08:02.689 --> 08:04.586
when the hole
numbers don't add up?

08:05.103 --> 08:06.482
But there's no reference...

08:06.482 --> 08:08.034
Like, there's claim
lines that don't exist.

08:09.310 --> 08:10.517
[bleep].

08:10.517 --> 08:11.655
What do you do?

08:13.724 --> 08:15.689
[Parker] Oh, this
kind of stuff's so annoying.

08:15.689 --> 08:17.413
We have to sort this out.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.068
The drill hole numbers
don't make sense.

08:19.482 --> 08:20.896
I'm gonna go get Liam.

08:21.827 --> 08:24.965
[dramatic music playing]

08:30.689 --> 08:33.000
The big thing is you do
not wanna put a cut

08:33.000 --> 08:34.586
in the wrong spot.

08:34.586 --> 08:38.000
Um, that's, like, a big,
old number one no-no,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.586
especially when to get
to the size we're at where

08:41.482 --> 08:43.000
every day is so expensive.

08:44.172 --> 08:46.793
[narrator] Parker heads
to find Liam Ferguson,

08:46.793 --> 08:50.379
the region's best driller
to see if he
can help.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.586
I think right now he's on
this property coming up here

08:56.586 --> 09:00.586
at Dean Russell's
Dominion Gold Resources.

09:02.689 --> 09:08.000
So I'll just go talk to Dean,
see where he's at.

09:20.275 --> 09:21.931
-Hello?
-[Dean] Hey, Parker.

09:21.931 --> 09:23.482
-[Parker] Hi.
-[Dean] Hey, how's it going?

09:23.482 --> 09:25.172
-Good, how are you?
-Oh, not bad.

09:25.172 --> 09:26.793
-What you up to?
-[Parker] Not a whole lot.

09:26.793 --> 09:28.931
-How have you been, Dean?
-I've been good.
I've been good.

09:28.931 --> 09:30.724
Um, is Liam over here?

09:30.724 --> 09:32.172
Yeah. He is up
there drilling for me.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.103
I got him proving up
some ground

09:34.103 --> 09:35.793
'cause I'm, you know,
getting on

09:35.793 --> 09:37.379
and I was thinking
of selling it, so...

09:37.379 --> 09:38.586
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

09:38.586 --> 09:41.275
We've got an American group
that's looking at the mine.

09:41.275 --> 09:43.551
So you're thinking
about selling out, huh?

09:44.068 --> 09:45.413
Yeah, I've been here 10 years.

09:45.413 --> 09:46.793
-It's--
-[Parker] Yeah.

09:46.793 --> 09:49.172
it's been a good 10 years,
but getting on,

09:49.172 --> 09:51.172
got grandchildren
I'd really like to see.

09:51.931 --> 09:53.448
And how many claims is it?

09:54.689 --> 09:55.931
Seven thousand five
hundred acres.

09:55.931 --> 09:58.965
Jeez, that's crazy.

09:59.793 --> 10:01.310
We got seven years left.

10:01.310 --> 10:03.275
-It's on a mining license?
-Yeah.

10:03.275 --> 10:04.793
It's a lot of years of mining.

10:04.793 --> 10:05.758
[Parker] Right.

10:07.379 --> 10:09.517
But we've had offers
on just the claims,

10:09.517 --> 10:13.000
but I'd like to sell it as
a package with all the houses,

10:13.000 --> 10:17.655
and underground services,
and just everything.

10:21.482 --> 10:22.655
Interesting.

10:25.896 --> 10:29.482
[narrator] 10 miles northeast
of Parker's old claims,

10:29.482 --> 10:33.000
Dominion Creek
is 7,500 acres,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.793
an area half
the size of Manhattan.

10:36.931 --> 10:39.413
It's a major
slice of historically

10:39.413 --> 10:41.034
gold-rich ground.

10:42.482 --> 10:45.896
With Dean looking to sell,
he's already got Liam

10:45.896 --> 10:49.172
drilling the property
to prove how much is here.

10:49.172 --> 10:50.586
Um,

10:53.172 --> 10:56.137
I might be interested in
having a look at your ground.

10:56.827 --> 10:59.482
-So Liam's drilling.
-Yeah.

10:59.482 --> 11:00.586
I'll be interested to see

11:00.586 --> 11:02.931
how Liam does
with the sonic rig.

11:02.931 --> 11:05.103
Well, I'll share that
with you if you...

11:05.103 --> 11:07.172
if you wanna take a more
serious look at it.

11:07.172 --> 11:09.344
Do you want to, uh,
split the drilling cost?

11:12.482 --> 11:14.413
I'll... We should talk price.

11:14.413 --> 11:15.689
But I'll...

11:16.793 --> 11:18.620
If you give me first dibs

11:18.620 --> 11:22.000
and if somebody else
is gonna make a deal,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.275
I'll pay for all the drill.

11:24.275 --> 11:26.586
[Dean] Okay.
As long as you move fast.

11:27.172 --> 11:28.344
You got a week.

11:31.896 --> 11:33.896
I don't like being rushed
on deals.

11:33.896 --> 11:36.275
-Um...
-Well, yeah.

11:36.275 --> 11:38.551
But you're not being rushed.
You're late to the table.

11:43.379 --> 11:44.586
Hmm.

11:48.482 --> 11:49.655
All right.

11:49.655 --> 11:51.551
Let's talk numbers and get
these guys out of the room.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.172
-Yeah, for sure.
-Um,

11:55.172 --> 11:56.379
can you guys...

11:56.379 --> 11:57.758
[makes sound]

12:00.413 --> 12:01.551
...get out?

12:02.275 --> 12:05.344
[dramatic music playing]

12:20.379 --> 12:23.862
Well, it's a big number.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.172
It's a big number.

12:27.827 --> 12:29.275
[bleep].

12:35.103 --> 12:37.000
I don't know if he wants to...

12:37.000 --> 12:39.172
The world to know
how much he wants,

12:39.172 --> 12:42.241
but I'm just gonna
tell you guys.

12:44.689 --> 12:47.482
For everything, the equipment,

12:47.482 --> 12:49.241
mining claims, blah, blah,

12:50.172 --> 12:54.241
camp, um, he wants 15 million.

12:55.896 --> 12:57.310
We can't afford it.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.586
That doesn't mean
we can't do it,

12:58.586 --> 12:59.896
but we can't afford it.

13:01.275 --> 13:02.793
Probably means
we shouldn't do it.

13:04.172 --> 13:07.827
[narrator] Parker faces
a massive decision.

13:07.827 --> 13:10.896
Continue on unproven
leased ground

13:10.896 --> 13:12.413
at Australia Creek

13:12.413 --> 13:16.103
or buy Dominion outright

13:16.103 --> 13:18.413
for $15 million,

13:18.413 --> 13:20.586
be his own landlord,

13:20.586 --> 13:22.758
and take home all the profit.

13:24.793 --> 13:26.862
[bleep] I don't know
how to do this.

13:30.724 --> 13:33.862
[suspenseful music playing]

13:45.896 --> 13:47.758
[Tony speaking]

14:09.000 --> 14:11.344
[intense music playing]

14:25.103 --> 14:27.586
[Tony speaking]

14:34.103 --> 14:37.000
[narrator] King
of the Klondike, Tony Beets,

14:37.000 --> 14:41.344
sits atop one of the biggest
mining empires in the Yukon.

14:43.413 --> 14:44.862
[Tony laughing]

14:46.482 --> 14:48.758
[Tony speaking]

14:50.620 --> 14:54.724
[narrator] And at 63,
he's just getting started.

14:54.724 --> 14:56.000
[Tony speaking]

15:04.586 --> 15:06.000
[narrator] Forty years ago,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.206
the dairy farmer
from the Netherlands

15:08.206 --> 15:10.000
moved to the Klondike

15:10.000 --> 15:13.482
with the dream of a better
life for his family

15:13.482 --> 15:16.379
and making a fortune in gold.

15:17.724 --> 15:19.793
[Tony speaking]

15:27.275 --> 15:30.103
[narrator] Now,
it's a family operation

15:30.103 --> 15:32.724
that hauls
in millions every year

15:32.724 --> 15:34.931
and controls
thousands of acres

15:34.931 --> 15:37.793
of prime gold-rich ground.

15:37.793 --> 15:43.586
[Tony speaking]

15:50.000 --> 15:53.586
[narrator] It's the first day
of the season for the Beets.

15:53.586 --> 15:57.172
The family starts
by clearing new ground.

15:57.172 --> 15:59.827
My dad's done
his years of running
around carrying boards.

15:59.827 --> 16:01.241
It's other people's turn.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.103
[narrator] Youngest son Mike

16:04.103 --> 16:05.793
rips frozen overburden

16:05.793 --> 16:07.724
in the D11 dozer

16:07.724 --> 16:10.034
to get down to the gold
pay layer.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.310
[Mike] If my dad
were to croak,

16:12.310 --> 16:15.689
I'd be the one to take
over operations here.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.103
I'm sure TB has
always kind of had it

16:22.103 --> 16:24.931
in his head
that he was gonna pass

16:24.931 --> 16:27.413
this business on to his kids.

16:27.413 --> 16:29.206
It's kind of what he
is been training us to do

16:29.206 --> 16:31.241
for the last 20-odd years.

16:32.068 --> 16:34.413
[narrator]
In the 750 excavator,

16:34.413 --> 16:36.172
28-year-old daughter,

16:36.172 --> 16:40.482
Monica loads rock trucks
to remove the waste dirt.

16:40.482 --> 16:44.482
Out of all three of us,
me, Michael, and Kevin,

16:44.482 --> 16:46.413
I'm sure Michael wants it.

16:46.413 --> 16:50.413
He's the only one
who truly takes pleasure

16:50.413 --> 16:52.862
and joy in doing this.

16:54.517 --> 16:57.172
While Kevin's trying
to figure out

16:57.172 --> 16:59.344
if this is something
he wants to do, you know?

17:08.172 --> 17:09.378
[narrator] Usually,

17:09.378 --> 17:13.103
Tony's eldest son
and chief mechanic, Kevin,

17:13.103 --> 17:15.172
looks after all
the equipment,

17:15.172 --> 17:17.275
but he hasn't turned up yet.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.103
[narrator]
Together, the Beets family

17:25.103 --> 17:27.896
had their best season
ever last year.

17:27.896 --> 17:31.793
Hauling in a record
5,300 ounces,

17:31.793 --> 17:34.655
$9 million in gold.

17:36.896 --> 17:39.068
[Tony speaking]

17:50.689 --> 17:52.482
[narrator] Last season,
Tony worked

17:52.482 --> 17:54.379
two lucrative spots.

17:54.379 --> 17:56.275
The nine-acre Cold Cut

17:56.275 --> 17:58.275
and the six-acre Blue Cut

17:58.275 --> 18:02.172
chasing the fabled gold-rich
white channel pay streak.

18:04.206 --> 18:07.586
Now, Tony plans
to mine out the half acre

18:07.586 --> 18:11.000
of ground that lies
between the two cuts,

18:11.000 --> 18:14.379
then extend outward
into the hill

18:14.379 --> 18:17.724
in search of more
white channel pay,

18:17.724 --> 18:21.793
mining a total of 18 acres
of ground,

18:21.793 --> 18:24.551
creating one giant super pit.

18:27.379 --> 18:28.517
[Tony speaking]

18:53.103 --> 18:56.482
[narrator] Tony needs his crew
to dig down 60 feet

18:56.482 --> 19:01.275
and remove over 4 million
tons of worthless overburden

19:01.275 --> 19:03.586
to hit the gold-rich
pay layer

19:04.379 --> 19:06.724
and wants
the first section exposed

19:06.724 --> 19:09.172
by the end of the week.

19:12.206 --> 19:14.000
[Mike] Everything in the cut's
gonna be frozen

19:14.000 --> 19:16.793
all the way down the further
in the hill we go,

19:16.793 --> 19:18.482
which is a big nuisance
'cause you have to spend

19:18.482 --> 19:23.068
a lot of money ripping
it so you can let it thaw.

19:26.103 --> 19:28.172
[bleep] Turn!

19:30.482 --> 19:31.965
[bleep]

19:35.620 --> 19:37.068
Tony, do you copy, Tony?

19:37.931 --> 19:39.172
[Tony] Go ahead.

19:39.172 --> 19:40.551
My shank just broke.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.896
[Tony speaking]

19:42.896 --> 19:46.275
[narrator] The frozen ground
is as hard as concrete

19:46.275 --> 19:49.172
and has snapped
the ripper shank in two.

19:49.172 --> 19:51.689
And with the amount
of [bleep] we have
to get ripped right now,

19:51.689 --> 19:53.344
it's not really a good time

19:54.103 --> 19:55.586
to be down a ripper Cat.

19:58.310 --> 20:01.103
[narrator] Mining on the edge
of the Arctic Circle,

20:01.103 --> 20:03.379
the Beets
have just six months to bank

20:03.379 --> 20:05.482
as much gold as possible.

20:05.482 --> 20:07.862
So, every day counts.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.793
[Tony speaking]

20:19.172 --> 20:22.275
[dramatic music playing]

20:34.103 --> 20:35.758
[Rick] I made the long trek
from Wisconsin

20:35.758 --> 20:38.172
right now and at the moment
I'm up in the gold fields.

20:39.517 --> 20:41.586
I've been gone a year.
I had... I had to take
a year off.

20:41.586 --> 20:44.172
I just had to take a minute
and get myself right
otherwise, uh,

20:44.172 --> 20:46.275
you know,
I was gonna crash and burn,

20:48.103 --> 20:50.068
and I almost did, so...

20:51.172 --> 20:54.172
[narrator] Nearly two
years after he shut the gates

20:54.172 --> 20:56.275
on his Yukon gold mine,

20:56.275 --> 20:59.689
Rick Ness is back.

20:59.689 --> 21:01.586
I'm pretty confident,
you know, in myself here

21:01.586 --> 21:03.758
that I [bleep] know
what I'm doing now.

21:04.517 --> 21:05.724
Things are gonna be different.

21:09.862 --> 21:13.689
[narrator] Eleven years ago
while on tour with his band,

21:13.689 --> 21:16.482
Rick got a call
from a 17-year-old kid

21:16.482 --> 21:18.103
that changed his life.

21:18.103 --> 21:20.103
[Parker] Hey Rick,
this is Parker Schnabel

21:20.103 --> 21:22.275
up here in Alaska.

21:22.275 --> 21:24.413
[narrator]
Chasing the dream of gold,

21:24.413 --> 21:27.758
Rick joined Parker
as his right-hand man.

21:27.758 --> 21:29.000
[Parker]
How many loads are you at?

21:29.000 --> 21:30.586
-[Rick] Seventy.
-[Parker] Really?

21:30.586 --> 21:32.275
-Yeah.
-[Parker] Nice job.

21:32.275 --> 21:35.482
[narrator] And after
six seasons together...

21:35.482 --> 21:38.000
This is our [bleep] gold, man.
This is our year.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.793
[narrator] Rick took a gamble
and became his own mine boss.

21:41.793 --> 21:44.068
-[Rick] Let's do it.
-Ready.

21:44.068 --> 21:46.206
[narrator] But in his
first solo season,

21:46.206 --> 21:47.965
tragedy struck.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.034
[Rick] My mom,
she fought pretty hard.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.068
[sniffs]

21:55.586 --> 21:57.275
It's hitting me now.

21:57.275 --> 21:59.379
[narrator] Despite
his mother's passing,

21:59.379 --> 22:01.172
Rick fought tooth and nail

22:01.172 --> 22:03.689
to build an operation
from nothing.

22:04.793 --> 22:06.379
-[Rick] No.
-That represents

22:06.379 --> 22:07.793
-victory right there.
-[man] Yeah.

22:07.793 --> 22:10.586
[narrator] And after three
up and down years,

22:10.586 --> 22:14.379
Rick triumphed scoring
a record season

22:14.379 --> 22:18.482
and $3.7 million in gold.

22:18.482 --> 22:19.931
I don't know how to top it.

22:21.793 --> 22:23.793
[narrator] Then, last year...

22:23.793 --> 22:24.862
[man] What's up?

22:24.862 --> 22:26.793
[narrator] It all came
crashing down.

22:26.793 --> 22:28.241
[man] Why aren't you mining?

22:28.896 --> 22:30.172
I don't know, man.

22:30.172 --> 22:32.172
Just depression. And I...

22:34.103 --> 22:35.793
That's... It's tough
for me to accept

22:35.793 --> 22:37.586
'cause I didn't grow up
like that.

22:37.586 --> 22:39.827
[narrator]
His life fell apart.

22:40.689 --> 22:42.655
He went MIA.

22:43.413 --> 22:45.379
And during his time away,

22:45.379 --> 22:49.413
Rick lost nearly
all his money.

22:49.413 --> 22:52.172
There was just a lot of...
A lot of turmoil,

22:52.172 --> 22:54.931
a lot of, you know,
mental things.

22:54.931 --> 22:56.758
Just, you know,

22:56.758 --> 22:58.689
a lot of things
I wasn't paying attention to

22:58.689 --> 23:01.172
just kind of came crashing
down on me all at once.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.413
[narrator]
Now, he's on a mission

23:03.413 --> 23:06.206
to get his life back together

23:06.206 --> 23:09.000
and find a ton of gold.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.862
[Rick] Now that I realized
that I've thought about it

23:10.862 --> 23:13.000
and I've seen the wrong moves
that I was making,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.068
well, [bleep] I mean,
once I had clarity,

23:15.068 --> 23:17.000
you know, I got
my [bleep] together.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.379
And now finally I'm up here

23:19.379 --> 23:21.551
and I know what the [bleep]
has to be done.

23:32.172 --> 23:33.758
I am picking up a good friend

23:33.758 --> 23:35.172
that's gonna work
with me for a while.

23:35.172 --> 23:37.275
He's gonna be here for a few
weeks just to get me going.

23:37.275 --> 23:38.689
Because I know
I can trust him

23:38.689 --> 23:40.103
and in fact,
I can't wait to see him.

23:40.103 --> 23:41.655
So I'm gonna go pick him up.

23:46.482 --> 23:48.379
[bleep] looks like his plane
already landed.

23:48.379 --> 23:49.758
There he is.

23:50.379 --> 23:52.000
-Zees.
-[Zee] Yeah?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.517
[laughs]

23:53.517 --> 23:54.896
[Rick] [bleep] made it.

23:54.896 --> 23:56.862
You [bleep] suitcase
is awesome.

23:56.862 --> 23:58.896
-How you doing, man?
-[Zee] I'm good. Good, good.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.586
-How you doing?
-Hey, man. Good.

24:00.586 --> 24:02.275
How's it feel
being back up here?

24:02.275 --> 24:03.689
-[Zee] It was a nice flight.
-Yeah?

24:03.689 --> 24:05.586
-[Zee] Not really.
-Yeah. [laughs]

24:05.586 --> 24:07.586
-[Zee] Back to Keno, huh?
-[Rick] Oh, yes, sir.

24:07.586 --> 24:09.206
[Zee] Let's do this.

24:09.206 --> 24:11.000
[narrator]
Rick's only crew member,

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
his hometown buddy
Zee Zaremba.

24:16.103 --> 24:17.103
To Keno.

24:17.103 --> 24:18.551
Keno or bust.

24:26.275 --> 24:28.275
[narrator] From Dawson City,

24:28.275 --> 24:32.482
Rick and Zee drive
180 miles east

24:32.482 --> 24:34.310
out of the Klondike

24:34.310 --> 24:37.344
to Rick's claim
near Keno City,

24:38.379 --> 24:41.172
which for the past
year-and-a-half

24:41.172 --> 24:43.103
has sat abandoned.

24:43.103 --> 24:45.275
Huh. Oh, boy.

25:00.068 --> 25:01.586
[Zee] So, you're telling me
the road's here?

25:01.586 --> 25:03.137
[chuckles] Yeah.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.275
That's deep.

25:11.206 --> 25:12.551
[Rick] Oh.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.448
[bleep]

25:17.586 --> 25:18.758
[bleep].

25:18.758 --> 25:20.344
I mean, there's no way to even
get into any of the doors.

25:21.689 --> 25:24.586
We got one small
little excavator here.

25:24.586 --> 25:26.000
We can get that started.
We can clear snow.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.896
Get in here, pop camp open.

25:27.896 --> 25:29.275
-Get us a place to stay.
-[Zee] Okay.

25:29.275 --> 25:30.689
And then we're gonna go
from there.

25:30.689 --> 25:31.586
Let's [bleep] do this.

25:31.586 --> 25:32.862
Let's get [bleep]
camp opened up.

25:36.413 --> 25:38.241
[Rick speaking]

25:48.379 --> 25:50.517
[narrator]
With barely any funds,

25:50.517 --> 25:52.379
Rick needs to get on the gold

25:52.379 --> 25:54.793
as quickly as possible,

25:54.793 --> 25:57.103
but with most
of his equipment returned

25:57.103 --> 25:58.620
to the rental company,

25:58.620 --> 26:00.931
clearing the camp
with just two people

26:00.931 --> 26:02.931
is a mammoth task.

26:04.275 --> 26:05.586
Oh, man.

26:06.103 --> 26:07.793
So much snow.

26:07.793 --> 26:09.586
It'd be better
if we had a loader here.

26:10.172 --> 26:11.586
Knee-high.

26:12.103 --> 26:13.586
[bleep].

26:13.586 --> 26:15.310
Is it slippery up there?

26:15.310 --> 26:17.689
[Rick] No, it's not slippery.
I'm just taking a break.

26:17.689 --> 26:19.068
[laughs]

26:19.862 --> 26:20.965
Oh, geez.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.068
This is brutal.

26:26.793 --> 26:29.172
Oh, so cold.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.103
I don't have the key.

26:35.103 --> 26:36.758
Don't tell anybody
how easy it is.

26:40.310 --> 26:42.655
It's been a couple...
It's been a couple of years.

26:44.275 --> 26:45.655
Come on in.

26:47.482 --> 26:50.482
Oh, buddy. Place is like
we just left it, so...

26:50.482 --> 26:52.482
I know, we can make it
into Monster Red.

26:56.103 --> 26:59.000
I need snowshoes
so I don't go through.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.275
[laughs]

27:01.896 --> 27:03.758
Oh, this is fun.

27:06.310 --> 27:08.275
Oh, I can see it already.

27:08.275 --> 27:11.482
There she is, buddy,
Monster Red.

27:11.482 --> 27:14.275
[dramatic music playing]

27:14.275 --> 27:16.758
[Rick] Dude, look at that,
right where I left her.

27:17.517 --> 27:19.482
[Zee] Did you think
it would move?

27:19.482 --> 27:21.068
You never know.

27:22.310 --> 27:24.896
[narrator] Monster Red
is the heartbeat

27:24.896 --> 27:26.413
of Rick's operation.

27:26.413 --> 27:29.000
The half a million dollar
wash plant

27:29.000 --> 27:31.103
is a custom-built beast

27:31.103 --> 27:35.034
that can run 300 yards of
gold-rich pay
an hour.

27:37.172 --> 27:38.517
[Rick] It almost feels
like I never left,

27:38.517 --> 27:39.827
that we could start it up
right now.

27:42.586 --> 27:44.965
Well, it just [bleep]
hit me now.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.896
It's a little bit of a...

27:48.896 --> 27:50.931
little more emotion in it
this year, you know?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.620
I appreciate you coming up
this year,

27:54.620 --> 27:56.413
especially just to get me
started like this.

27:56.413 --> 27:58.758
-I appreciate it, buddy.
-Yeah. No problem.

28:05.482 --> 28:08.551
[dramatic music playing]

28:20.482 --> 28:23.034
So, Dean wants 15 million
bucks for the place.

28:25.482 --> 28:26.793
It's a steep price.

28:26.793 --> 28:28.655
It's a really steep price

28:29.379 --> 28:33.241
but it's a huge block
of ground.

28:34.793 --> 28:36.793
If we wanna stay
the size we're at,

28:36.793 --> 28:39.103
then this is probably
the only one in the Yukon

28:39.103 --> 28:41.689
that we could
get our hands on.

28:43.275 --> 28:44.793
[narrator] Parker Schnabel

28:44.793 --> 28:48.103
is weighing up the deal
of a lifetime

28:48.103 --> 28:51.482
whether to buy 7,500 acres

28:51.482 --> 28:53.206
of ground at Dominion

28:53.206 --> 28:56.965
or stick with the unproven
Australia Creek.

28:59.275 --> 29:01.517
The final landing place
that we just got to

29:01.517 --> 29:04.310
is five down and 3.75
at the end of this year,

29:04.310 --> 29:06.482
and then more payments
for a couple more years.

29:07.482 --> 29:09.586
If you have 5 million bucks
in the bank account,

29:09.586 --> 29:13.379
but that's normally down
to like less than one

29:13.379 --> 29:18.172
by the time we're sluicing
full bore with two plants.

29:18.172 --> 29:22.655
[narrator] This will be
the most Parker has ever paid
for ground.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.896
If he spends his war chest

29:25.896 --> 29:28.482
on the $5 million
down payment,

29:28.482 --> 29:32.241
he'll be in the red
before he even begins.

29:33.103 --> 29:35.689
[Parker] I've always been
scared of debt.

29:35.689 --> 29:39.620
Can we find a pit that has
$15 million in profit in it?

29:39.620 --> 29:42.344
Because then,
everything else is gravy.

29:43.793 --> 29:45.275
Let's go find Liam.

29:53.862 --> 29:56.068
[narrator] Parker meets friend
and drilling expert,

29:56.068 --> 29:57.517
Liam Ferguson,

29:57.517 --> 29:59.965
to get the lowdown
on Dominion.

30:00.482 --> 30:01.862
Hi.

30:05.758 --> 30:07.172
Are you having fun?

30:07.689 --> 30:09.448
Yeah, same as always.

30:10.862 --> 30:12.620
So, I was talking to Dean

30:12.620 --> 30:14.689
and he said
that you were drilling here

30:14.689 --> 30:16.862
-because he's selling
the ground.
-Yeah.

30:16.862 --> 30:19.000
And I was like, "Oh [bleep].

30:19.000 --> 30:20.413
We might be interested
in buying it."

30:20.413 --> 30:22.758
And him and I talked numbers

30:22.758 --> 30:24.586
and some stuff and...
I don't know.

30:24.586 --> 30:26.586
He conned me into paying
for part of your bill.

30:27.103 --> 30:29.793
-Great.
-[laughs]

30:29.793 --> 30:33.793
That means we get first dibs
if we want to buy it.

30:33.793 --> 30:37.275
-Well, that works.
-So, are you finding any gold?

30:37.275 --> 30:40.689
[Liam] Yeah. It's been
a little bit spotty.

30:40.689 --> 30:43.172
We've picked it up
in a few places,

30:43.172 --> 30:46.000
but there's a few spots
where I'd like to go back

30:46.000 --> 30:47.689
and check a bit better.

30:47.689 --> 30:49.413
Right.

30:49.413 --> 30:51.275
He's telling you
where to drill, right?

30:51.275 --> 30:53.172
Yeah, for the most part.

30:53.172 --> 30:55.586
So, okay, I guess now I am?

30:55.586 --> 30:58.172
If you're paying the bills,
I'll do what you want.

30:58.172 --> 31:01.896
So in my mind, it's like
probably looking for a cut

31:01.896 --> 31:04.862
that would pay
for the place, right?

31:04.862 --> 31:06.413
Like, if there's 10,000 ounces

31:06.413 --> 31:08.206
that we can do
for 5 million bucks,

31:08.206 --> 31:09.689
-the place is paid for?
-Right.

31:09.689 --> 31:11.000
-[Parker] Right?
-[Liam] Yeah.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.482
Well, at the bare minimum,

31:12.482 --> 31:13.896
you wanna make sure
there's enough gold here

31:13.896 --> 31:15.551
to cover the costs and...

31:16.517 --> 31:18.275
not go broke like most people

31:18.275 --> 31:19.931
that have mined here before.

31:21.379 --> 31:22.931
He wants it closed in a week.

31:22.931 --> 31:24.172
[Liam] In a week?

31:25.896 --> 31:28.000
Yeah. Well, I don't...
If there's gold there

31:28.000 --> 31:31.172
and it's a good enough grade,
then it's possible.

31:31.172 --> 31:33.379
Yeah. You and I don't have
a great track record

31:33.379 --> 31:35.931
of drilling out
like our $15 million pit

31:35.931 --> 31:38.275
in a week, or a month,
or a season, or...

31:38.275 --> 31:40.000
We're pretty good
at disproving ground.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.620
[Parker] Yeah. We've done good
at that.

31:41.620 --> 31:43.103
[laughs]

31:43.103 --> 31:45.482
All right.
Send me the results as you can

31:45.482 --> 31:47.379
and I'm gonna start looking
at equipment

31:47.379 --> 31:49.379
and kind of seeing
what the place is worth

31:49.379 --> 31:51.068
from a non-ground standpoint.

31:51.068 --> 31:52.758
And then you and I
can have a chat

31:52.758 --> 31:55.793
in maybe a few days
once you have some answers.

31:55.793 --> 31:57.172
[Liam] All right.
Leave it with me.

31:57.172 --> 31:58.931
We'll see what we can find.

31:58.931 --> 32:00.689
Okay. All right. Thanks, dude.

32:03.586 --> 32:06.000
But I know a fair bit about
this piece of property here

32:06.000 --> 32:08.620
and it's kind of been
one of the biggest spots left

32:08.620 --> 32:10.620
in the Klondike
for a long, long time.

32:10.620 --> 32:12.068
There's been a lot
of people coming,

32:12.068 --> 32:13.275
trying to make it work

32:13.275 --> 32:14.793
and some have had success

32:14.793 --> 32:16.896
and some haven't.

32:16.896 --> 32:19.241
I hope we can find
what he needs.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.517
[Parker] I always like
working with Liam.

32:22.517 --> 32:24.689
He grew up gold mining
like I did

32:24.689 --> 32:27.103
and he has a real head
for this stuff.

32:27.103 --> 32:29.655
If there's gold somewhere,
he's gonna find it.

32:38.758 --> 32:42.172
[dramatic music playing]

32:42.172 --> 32:43.793
When's the last time
you drove on these roads?

32:43.793 --> 32:45.000
It was probably [bleep]
forever, right? [bleep].

32:45.000 --> 32:46.586
Four year... Five years ago?

32:46.586 --> 32:49.172
-[bleep].
-Yeah.

32:49.172 --> 32:52.448
[narrator] Rick Ness
is on a comeback mission

32:52.448 --> 32:56.137
having gone MIA
for over a year.

32:56.137 --> 32:58.275
After opening up camp,

32:58.275 --> 33:02.068
Rick and friend, Zee,
head off to pick up supplies.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.793
So last May
when I was over there,

33:10.793 --> 33:12.379
you was thinking
about going up

33:12.379 --> 33:14.241
and you ended up
not going up, eh?

33:14.241 --> 33:15.586
-Yeah. Mining last year?
-[Zee] Yeah.

33:15.586 --> 33:17.586
[Rick] Yeah, yeah.
I was late in the game

33:17.586 --> 33:20.172
and I just...
Man, I just was not prepared.

33:20.172 --> 33:22.862
Prepared for mining
or prepared for life?

33:24.034 --> 33:25.586
Yeah. Prepared
for pretty much anything.

33:25.586 --> 33:27.000
I mean, it's...

33:27.000 --> 33:29.241
A lot of things fell apart,
you know?

33:30.103 --> 33:31.862
Being totally open and honest,

33:31.862 --> 33:34.034
you know, I just didn't have
the energy to do anything

33:34.034 --> 33:37.275
and, you know, I was doing
a little [bleep]

33:37.275 --> 33:39.896
you know, cocaine
to try and get [bleep] going.

33:39.896 --> 33:41.896
-Yeah.
-And for a while,

33:41.896 --> 33:43.068
it seemed like an answer.

33:43.068 --> 33:44.758
It made me feel good
for a bit.
You know what I mean?

33:44.758 --> 33:46.517
That's all the hell
I was looking for.

33:47.275 --> 33:50.137
But surprise, surprise,
that didn't work.

33:51.068 --> 33:52.586
I lost money, you know?

33:52.586 --> 33:54.586
I hit rock bottom
and I just went,

33:54.586 --> 33:56.172
"What the [bleep]
are you doing, man?"

33:56.172 --> 33:57.896
Like, how the [bleep]
did you end up here?

33:57.896 --> 34:00.551
-Yeah.
-Shape the [bleep] up.

34:00.551 --> 34:02.172
You know what I mean?
This ain't the answer,

34:02.172 --> 34:05.068
so find out
what the [bleep] answer is.

34:05.068 --> 34:07.137
The thing I was always worried
about is just the...

34:07.137 --> 34:08.965
You know, like the depression,

34:08.965 --> 34:11.137
-because I...
-And that's what it was.

34:12.172 --> 34:14.172
I'm not proud
of everything I'd done,

34:14.172 --> 34:16.172
but I [bleep] did it.
You know what I mean?

34:16.172 --> 34:18.103
And there's no use [bleep]
trying to hide it now.

34:18.103 --> 34:20.551
You know, I did it.
I [bleep] learned from it.

34:20.551 --> 34:22.172
You know, that ain't me now.

34:23.655 --> 34:25.241
Like, I ain't going down
that path anymore.

34:25.241 --> 34:27.965
-Yeah.
-It's in my past.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.688
All this stuff, like,
there's something

34:31.688 --> 34:33.379
-that started it.
-[Rick] Yeah. You know,

34:33.379 --> 34:36.068
I lost my mom and everything
went [bleep] after that.

34:38.068 --> 34:40.241
I mean, I held her
as she died in the house

34:40.241 --> 34:43.068
and we brought her
out of the house

34:43.068 --> 34:44.724
and I locked the door.

34:46.275 --> 34:47.862
Couldn't go up there
for five years.

34:47.862 --> 34:49.688
I ignored it.
You know, I ignored it.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.862
I pushed it out.
Like, I don't wanna go
up there.

34:53.172 --> 34:54.344
So...

34:57.068 --> 35:01.000
so, yeah, just give me
a second.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.379
But, you know,
I was pretty solid going in

35:05.379 --> 35:06.862
to deal with it and I did.

35:08.275 --> 35:10.448
I went up there
and got all the pictures

35:10.448 --> 35:13.275
and uh... [clears throat]

35:13.275 --> 35:14.482
I got everything I need,

35:14.482 --> 35:16.103
you know, to remind me of her

35:16.103 --> 35:18.000
and I sold her house.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.793
You know what I mean?
It's just a house.

35:19.793 --> 35:22.379
-It's not her. Yup.
-[Rick] You know what I mean?

35:22.379 --> 35:24.172
It felt really good to do
that, you know what I mean?

35:24.172 --> 35:25.758
So, I did.

35:29.655 --> 35:31.586
I mean, that was
the turning point,

35:31.586 --> 35:33.172
you know, it was like my mom
was helping me out again,

35:33.172 --> 35:35.000
you know, I sold her house
and that was the money

35:35.000 --> 35:36.586
I needed to get back up here.

35:36.586 --> 35:39.000
-Yeah.
-To get gold again, so...

35:39.000 --> 35:41.172
-Ah. It is, you know...
-Well, let's do this.

35:41.172 --> 35:42.586
-Yeah.
-Let's do her proud.

35:42.586 --> 35:44.068
That's why I'm here.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.413
[dramatic music playing]

36:01.793 --> 36:03.965
[Tony speaking]

36:06.172 --> 36:08.034
[Mike] Yeah. She's [bleep].

36:08.034 --> 36:09.793
[narrator] At Paradise Hill,

36:09.793 --> 36:11.586
the Beets family are racing

36:11.586 --> 36:13.758
to get to pay dirt
in the Super Pit

36:13.758 --> 36:15.310
by the end of the week,

36:16.034 --> 36:18.275
but they're down a D11 dozer

36:18.275 --> 36:20.448
with a busted ripper shank.

36:26.758 --> 36:28.379
[Mike] [bleep] There you go.

36:28.379 --> 36:30.034
[narrator] After a 3-day wait,

36:30.034 --> 36:35.103
the replacement 1.3 ton shank
has finally arrived.

36:35.103 --> 36:39.379
But with chief mechanic
Kevin Beets not back yet,

36:39.379 --> 36:42.275
Tony needs his other kids
to step up

36:42.275 --> 36:45.000
and get the dozer
back in the cut.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.206
[Tony speaking]

37:01.482 --> 37:02.551
[Mike] Good.

37:03.172 --> 37:05.137
[Tony speaking]

37:37.793 --> 37:39.827
[Tony speaking]

37:40.793 --> 37:44.344
[Mike] No, I don't know
why it's not doing it.

37:44.344 --> 37:46.862
-That [bleep] is in there.
-Solid.

38:03.793 --> 38:06.448
[narrator]
The D11 dozer's ripper arm

38:06.448 --> 38:09.379
has a hydraulic
pull/push mechanism

38:09.379 --> 38:12.275
that inserts a pin through
one of the three holes

38:12.275 --> 38:13.689
in the shank,

38:13.689 --> 38:16.172
locking the shank in place.

38:16.172 --> 38:18.000
But the hydraulic system

38:18.000 --> 38:20.965
doesn't have enough power
to push it in.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.172
Tony's simple solution,

38:23.172 --> 38:25.689
remove the pin by hand,

38:25.689 --> 38:28.275
make sure
the holes are lined up,

38:28.275 --> 38:30.172
and hammer the pin in

38:30.172 --> 38:34.413
until the hydraulics are able
to lock it in place.

38:35.137 --> 38:36.931
Here. Give me the hammer.

38:38.655 --> 38:40.000
And [bleep] you,
you can hold that,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.551
'cause I've had people
smash my fingers too often.

38:52.068 --> 38:54.482
[Tony speaking]

38:54.482 --> 38:56.103
That's why I'm swinging
the hammer.

38:57.793 --> 39:00.655
[Tony speaking]

39:18.896 --> 39:20.793
[Mike] It's going there.
It's going.

39:20.793 --> 39:23.172
-[Tony speaking]
-Yup.

39:23.172 --> 39:24.896
[Mike] I got a little bit more
I can go in,

39:24.896 --> 39:26.655
but that'll be fine.
We can do that as we work it.

39:26.655 --> 39:30.344
[Tony speaking]

39:39.586 --> 39:42.965
[narrator] The Beets must
now strip around the clock

39:42.965 --> 39:45.655
to get down to pay dirt
by the end of the week.

39:45.655 --> 39:48.379
[Mike] Literally throwing
everything we have
at this cut right now.

39:48.379 --> 39:49.758
Go, go, go, go, go.

40:11.689 --> 40:14.620
[dramatic music playing]

40:22.793 --> 40:26.172
I'm in Keno and, uh,
you know, one of the first
things I gotta do

40:26.172 --> 40:27.275
is I gotta talk to Troy,

40:27.275 --> 40:29.379
he's the landowner
of the ground
I've been mining,

40:29.379 --> 40:31.896
and I've been away
for a whole season.

40:31.896 --> 40:34.034
[narrator]
Rick Ness is on a mission

40:34.034 --> 40:36.586
to resurrect
his mining career,

40:36.586 --> 40:38.344
hit a big payday,

40:38.344 --> 40:41.275
and get his life
back on track.

40:41.275 --> 40:43.586
-Let's do this.
-[narrator]
Four seasons ago...

40:43.586 --> 40:44.689
Ooh-wee.

40:44.689 --> 40:47.103
Rick gambled
on leaving the Klondike

40:47.103 --> 40:49.862
to lease new ground
at Duncan Creek.

40:51.068 --> 40:52.931
[Rick] I'm taking this year
very personal.

40:53.655 --> 40:55.275
[narrator]
It was a rough start...

40:55.275 --> 40:57.931
I think we've got
a lot to learn here.

40:58.172 --> 40:59.862
[laughing]

40:59.862 --> 41:01.896
[narrator] But Rick
turned it around...

41:01.896 --> 41:03.275
[Rick] That's a [bleep]
beauty.

41:03.275 --> 41:04.793
Like that's worth
some serious money.

41:04.793 --> 41:07.793
[narrator] ...enabling him
to buy the claim...

41:07.793 --> 41:09.103
We're ready to sell.

41:09.103 --> 41:10.689
[narrator]
...making a handshake deal

41:10.689 --> 41:13.172
with landowner, Troy Taylor,

41:13.172 --> 41:18.689
laying down $270,000
in gold.

41:18.689 --> 41:21.689
Just to be clear,
this is the down payment.

41:21.689 --> 41:23.586
-[Rick] Yup.
-And it's non-refundable.

41:23.586 --> 41:25.275
Hopefully next season
by the end,

41:25.275 --> 41:26.896
you'll have it paid off.

41:26.896 --> 41:29.103
[Rick] Yeah. I'm confident
I can do it.

41:29.689 --> 41:31.862
[dramatic music playing]

41:31.862 --> 41:34.068
[narrator] But after
Rick's lost season

41:34.068 --> 41:35.896
and missed payments,

41:35.896 --> 41:39.172
Troy has been threatening
to back out of the deal.

41:39.172 --> 41:40.586
If he does,

41:40.586 --> 41:44.068
Rick's mining career is over.

41:45.068 --> 41:47.000
Would I be happy
if I was in Troy's place,

41:47.000 --> 41:48.482
you know, and I was just
gone for a whole season

41:48.482 --> 41:50.241
when I was supposed
to be producing gold

41:50.241 --> 41:52.103
and then paying him money
for the ground?

41:52.103 --> 41:53.344
I don't think I would.

41:53.344 --> 41:56.448
[tense music playing]

42:11.482 --> 42:14.000
-Hey, Troy.
-Hey, stranger.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.620
Um, you wanna have a chat or?

42:17.482 --> 42:18.827
-Sure.
-All right.

42:19.586 --> 42:21.034
Well, okay.

42:24.793 --> 42:25.896
Well...

42:28.172 --> 42:30.000
-[Troy] We have a lot
to talk about and...
-Yeah.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.241
[Troy] ...there's a lot of...
A lot of issues out there.

42:34.172 --> 42:35.689
We had a whole year

42:35.689 --> 42:37.689
-of no gold production.
-Yeah.

42:37.689 --> 42:40.965
We've had people that want
to mine here,

42:40.965 --> 42:44.655
but we've had to say no
because we wanna honor
the agreement.

42:46.379 --> 42:48.344
I know it was not good
for business to be gone

42:48.344 --> 42:49.896
for a year,
a season like that,

42:49.896 --> 42:51.689
um, not good for you
and not good for me.

42:51.689 --> 42:53.551
Mmm-hmm.

42:53.551 --> 42:55.862
I'm hoping, you know,
that you can give me

42:55.862 --> 42:58.034
another chance here,
uh, because...

42:58.034 --> 42:59.689
I feel better than I have
in 10 years

42:59.689 --> 43:03.000
and, uh, and I've got
a better plan.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.758
I do wanna continue on.
I do wanna own this land.

43:05.758 --> 43:07.275
All I need is a shot.

43:07.275 --> 43:08.862
-Mmm-hmm.
-[Rick chuckles]

43:13.137 --> 43:17.103
I'm just nervous about
whether you can pull it off.

43:17.103 --> 43:19.137
Got a lot of catching up
to do.

43:19.137 --> 43:22.275
Now, you're about a year
behind on your payments, so...

43:22.275 --> 43:27.000
-Yeah.
-[Troy] Do you have some ideas
how to deal with that?

43:27.000 --> 43:28.896
[Rick] You know,
I don't... I'm not...
I'm just gonna be honest,

43:28.896 --> 43:31.172
you know, I...
I'm tapped out, you know?

43:31.172 --> 43:32.655
-[Troy] Mmm-hmm.
-I've got... I've got

43:32.655 --> 43:34.344
-operating money. I do.
-Mmm-hmm.

43:34.896 --> 43:36.586
We need something

43:36.586 --> 43:39.241
to get your foot back
in the door there.

43:39.241 --> 43:40.379
Yes, sir.

43:40.379 --> 43:42.344
I'm ready to do,
you know, whatever it takes.

43:44.275 --> 43:47.000
Is there anything
we could work out

43:47.758 --> 43:50.137
in you, regarding your camp?
Like, uh...

43:51.137 --> 43:54.241
I think I paid...
It was $210,000 for it,

43:54.241 --> 43:57.862
so I would be willing to sign
that camp over to you guys,

43:57.862 --> 44:00.137
um, in lieu of gold
and then, uh,

44:00.137 --> 44:02.275
and then, I'd, you know,
be coming back for it,

44:02.275 --> 44:03.793
obviously,
'cause we need to live in it.

44:03.793 --> 44:06.068
And, uh, you know,
and get you the gold,

44:06.068 --> 44:07.482
pay out for that
if you're happy

44:07.482 --> 44:09.206
to have that asset
to hold on to.

44:11.689 --> 44:13.206
Yeah.

44:16.689 --> 44:17.655
Well...

44:19.379 --> 44:20.655
I think we can make it work.

44:21.482 --> 44:22.724
I appreciate that, Troy.

44:24.689 --> 44:26.000
I'm just gonna go
get after it.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.379
I'll get that
paperwork for you

44:27.379 --> 44:28.965
and then I'm gonna get you
some gold.

44:28.965 --> 44:30.275
Okay, Rick. Talk to you soon.

44:30.275 --> 44:31.448
[Rick] Yup.

44:38.103 --> 44:39.310
Well...

44:40.000 --> 44:41.275
that actually went
pretty good.

44:41.275 --> 44:44.103
Um, a lot of hesitancy there

44:44.103 --> 44:46.172
which, you know,
I pretty much expected.

44:46.172 --> 44:49.517
Like I said coming in,
I'd have been the same way.

44:51.551 --> 44:53.551
[Troy] Well, to be honest,
I'm still annoyed.

44:53.551 --> 44:55.689
It's just, um,

44:55.689 --> 44:58.103
we committed to him

44:58.103 --> 45:00.551
and we got a whole year loss.

45:00.551 --> 45:03.965
But I'm also nervous

45:03.965 --> 45:06.000
if he can really
do it or not.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.379
I'll help him as much as I can

45:08.379 --> 45:10.965
but there's only so much
I can do, so...

45:12.000 --> 45:14.448
I don't enjoy putting, you
know, things that I own up

45:14.448 --> 45:16.068
for collateral,
like I've worked very hard

45:16.068 --> 45:17.482
not to have to do that but,

45:17.482 --> 45:20.586
you know, I'm behind
the eight ball here,
as they say, this year.

45:20.586 --> 45:21.896
And I'm gonna
have to do [bleep]

45:21.896 --> 45:25.000
that I'm not comfortable with
probably all season, so...

45:25.000 --> 45:25.896
That's the first one.

45:25.896 --> 45:27.344
First one of probably many.

45:27.344 --> 45:29.241
But it worked
and I'm back on the gold.

45:44.379 --> 45:45.862
[Mitch] You know,
I had a great winter.

45:45.862 --> 45:47.482
Got to spend lots of time
with my daughter,

45:47.482 --> 45:49.000
lots of time with my wife.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.034
And now I'm back to the Yukon.

45:53.034 --> 45:55.586
[narrator] Parker's foreman
and right-hand man

45:55.586 --> 45:58.758
Mitch Blaschke is back
for the season.

45:59.793 --> 46:02.034
Parker hasn't said much
over the winter,

46:02.034 --> 46:04.137
which has me
a little concerned,

46:04.137 --> 46:06.448
but there certainly never been
a shortage of work.

46:11.172 --> 46:12.689
Anybody home?

46:12.689 --> 46:13.862
[Parker] Mitch.

46:13.862 --> 46:15.448
What's going on?

46:16.689 --> 46:17.689
[laughs]

46:17.689 --> 46:20.000
-Good to see you, man.
-Good to see you too.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.103
-How was the drive?
-Oh, dude,

46:22.103 --> 46:23.344
it never gets any shorter.

46:23.344 --> 46:25.000
-You look good.
-Yeah?

46:25.000 --> 46:26.689
I had a great winter, man.
It was a lot of fun.

46:26.689 --> 46:28.551
[Parker] Good.
You do some racing?

46:28.551 --> 46:30.793
-[Mitch] Yeah.
I did some racing.
-Nice.

46:30.793 --> 46:33.172
[Mitch] What's the plan?
Get down to Cam's
and start working on that?

46:33.172 --> 46:35.000
Yeah.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
We just signed a deal
on Australia Creek.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.482
Okay.

46:38.482 --> 46:44.034
And I am not sure
what's gonna happen
with it yet

46:44.034 --> 46:48.793
because we're taking a pretty
serious look at that piece
of property on Dominion,

46:48.793 --> 46:49.896
at Dean Russell's.

46:49.896 --> 46:51.241
-Okay.
-Lock, stock, and barrel.

46:52.103 --> 46:53.896
With people being on it
for that long,

46:53.896 --> 46:55.689
is there much ground
left there or is it all--

46:55.689 --> 46:58.137
[Parker] There's quite a bit.
Yeah. There's a fair bit.

46:58.137 --> 47:01.000
It's like the last stretch
of virgin ground

47:01.000 --> 47:03.344
that is on those
like big producing creeks.

47:03.344 --> 47:06.758
-So you're crazy to not
at least look at it, right?
-Yeah.

47:07.793 --> 47:09.482
[Parker] It's a steep price.

47:09.482 --> 47:12.551
And so we need to get
the purchase price hacked down

47:12.551 --> 47:14.793
through just selling
a whole pile of stuff.

47:14.793 --> 47:16.758
But I don't know
what kind of shape
the gear's in it at all.

47:18.172 --> 47:20.103
I was wondering if you could
go look at the gear.

47:20.655 --> 47:21.655
Okay.

47:21.655 --> 47:23.275
My hope was to come up

47:23.275 --> 47:25.551
with around 2,500,000 bucks
worth of equipment.

47:28.758 --> 47:29.896
Okay. Sounds good, man.

47:29.896 --> 47:31.000
-I'll go check it out.
-[Parker] Thanks, Mitch.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.827
Glad to have you back.

47:37.344 --> 47:40.068
Potential for Parker to own
his own ground in the Yukon.

47:40.068 --> 47:42.586
How nice would that be?
No more landlords.

47:42.586 --> 47:44.655
No more paying royalties.

47:44.655 --> 47:47.448
I know it's a lot of money,
but if Parker
doesn't jump on it,

47:47.448 --> 47:48.758
somebody else will.

47:50.689 --> 47:54.862
[narrator] To find $2,500,000
worth of iron,

47:54.862 --> 47:58.655
Mitch starts
in Dominion Creek's
laydown yard...

48:00.068 --> 48:02.655
-[Mitch] Jay Sands,
what's up, buddy?
-Hey, Jordie.

48:02.655 --> 48:04.896
[narrator] ...with mechanic
Jordan Sands

48:04.896 --> 48:07.310
and plant boss, Tyson Lee.

48:09.793 --> 48:11.172
[Mitch] What year do you think
this thing is, Jordie?

48:11.172 --> 48:13.068
It's like early '80s?

48:13.068 --> 48:15.068
-[Jordan] Early '80s, yeah.
-[Mitch] Yeah.

48:15.068 --> 48:17.586
I like the wood
on the side of it though

48:17.586 --> 48:21.275
and the old plastic panel.

48:21.275 --> 48:23.379
How about this one?
This one...

48:23.379 --> 48:25.448
A little newer here.
Not too bad-looking.

48:26.379 --> 48:28.206
See if she'll fire up, Jordie.

48:33.551 --> 48:35.034
Oh, we got $10,000 on it.

48:35.034 --> 48:37.655
-Oh, yeah?
-That's what it says anyways.

48:42.172 --> 48:43.896
[bleep] the thing
won't shut off.

48:43.896 --> 48:46.551
-It won't die?
-No. It won't [bleep] die.

48:53.482 --> 48:56.000
What do you think of your new
service truck there, Jordie?

48:56.000 --> 48:58.068
[Jordan] Wicked. It's got
a screwdriver to start it.

49:00.482 --> 49:02.482
Okay. It'll go. It'll go.

49:02.482 --> 49:05.448
It just needs
a little persuasion.

49:06.655 --> 49:09.241
-Oh, yeah.
-You gotta swear at it.

49:09.689 --> 49:11.241
[Mitch] So we got...

49:11.241 --> 49:13.137
-You know
what this is for, right?
-It's probably like--

49:13.137 --> 49:15.758
Beating yourself on the head
after buying all this stuff?

49:15.758 --> 49:18.310
-Yeah.
-Oh, wait.

49:19.344 --> 49:21.241
Literally, just the case.

49:21.241 --> 49:23.482
Hopefully, the ground
doesn't do the same thing
as that.

49:23.482 --> 49:24.620
-Right?
-Empty.

49:30.758 --> 49:32.344
I don't know.
I don't know if there's...

49:33.344 --> 49:35.206
Do you think
there's 2,500,000 bucks here?

49:44.862 --> 49:48.586
[dramatic music playing]

49:48.586 --> 49:51.172
Do you think
there's 2,500,000 bucks here?

49:51.172 --> 49:53.689
There ain't $500,000 worth
of [bleep] right here.

49:53.689 --> 49:56.068
[narrator] To offset
Dominion Creek's

49:56.068 --> 49:59.103
$15,000,000 all-in price tag,

49:59.103 --> 50:02.000
Parker's tasked Mitch
with finding

50:02.000 --> 50:05.275
$2,500,000 worth
of equipment to sell.

50:05.275 --> 50:07.482
[Mitch] We got
about another $2,000,000

50:07.482 --> 50:09.344
worth of equipment
we need to find easily.

50:09.344 --> 50:10.758
I'm gonna go fix our stuff

50:10.758 --> 50:12.379
and then I'll see you
at dinner

50:12.379 --> 50:14.827
and see if you found
the other $2,000,000.

50:15.689 --> 50:17.241
Wanna go see what
their wash plants look like?

50:17.241 --> 50:18.758
Yeah. Let's go check it out.

50:28.482 --> 50:29.965
[Tyson] Holy [bleep].

50:29.965 --> 50:32.931
That is a behemoth
of a wash plant.

50:33.758 --> 50:37.103
Look at that thing.
Conveyors on conveyors.

50:40.068 --> 50:42.551
[Tyson] I don't know
if this is my dream
or my worst nightmare.

50:42.551 --> 50:43.689
[Mitch] Uh, the conveyors?

50:43.689 --> 50:44.862
That's a nightmare.

50:47.172 --> 50:48.758
Dude, look at this thing.

50:51.068 --> 50:53.896
This thing would hustle
some dirt, man.

50:53.896 --> 50:55.413
[Tyson] No kidding.

50:56.379 --> 50:58.344
It'd be a nightmare
to move it.

51:00.965 --> 51:03.379
It's gotta be worth
easy $300,000

51:03.379 --> 51:04.689
even just where it sits.

51:04.689 --> 51:06.551
-Like--
-[Tyson] Yeah. For sure.

51:10.275 --> 51:12.275
[Mitch] All right.
What else we got right here?

51:12.275 --> 51:14.689
We have a excavator conveyor.

51:14.689 --> 51:16.034
Parker's gonna like that.

51:16.034 --> 51:17.172
And those are not cheap.

51:17.172 --> 51:18.344
So that is a good thing.

51:19.137 --> 51:20.758
'Cause we use those a lot,

51:20.758 --> 51:22.241
and that looks like
it's in pretty good shape.

51:23.896 --> 51:27.896
And we also have another one
right here around the corner.

51:27.896 --> 51:29.655
So two excavator conveyors.

51:29.655 --> 51:31.206
That helps us out a bunch.

51:32.689 --> 51:34.862
-Dreams do come true, Mitch.
-What do we have here?

51:34.862 --> 51:36.448
Can you believe it?

51:36.448 --> 51:38.931
Son of a Slucifer.

51:42.241 --> 51:44.758
Check this thing out, man.

51:44.758 --> 51:46.172
[Tyson]
I think I'm having deja vu.

51:46.172 --> 51:48.172
-Yeah.
-It's like Slucifer but--

51:48.172 --> 51:50.137
[Mitch]
But a little different.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.862
It has not seen much material
go through it.

51:55.862 --> 51:57.137
[Tyson]
No. It looks brand-new.

51:59.275 --> 52:01.344
[Mitch] You look down here
at the chutes,

52:01.344 --> 52:03.000
you look at the riffles...

52:03.000 --> 52:04.482
-I mean, this thing is--
-Still got the paint on it

52:04.482 --> 52:05.655
in a lot of spots, man.

52:05.655 --> 52:08.000
Yeah. This thing is very new,

52:08.000 --> 52:10.413
and that's good
because it holds some value.

52:13.172 --> 52:16.137
With the equipment we've seen
at that other blue wash plant,

52:16.137 --> 52:17.896
we got the excavator
conveyors, you know,

52:17.896 --> 52:20.793
we're probably
at about $1,300,000.

52:20.793 --> 52:22.551
-[Tyson] Yeah.
-Dude, this is gonna put us...

52:22.551 --> 52:24.103
You know, at today's prices
and stuff,

52:24.103 --> 52:25.344
we're probably right
about 2,000,000 bucks.

52:26.172 --> 52:27.862
We might not be
that $2,500,000

52:27.862 --> 52:30.448
but we're pretty close.

52:35.862 --> 52:38.344
[tense music playing]

52:46.068 --> 52:49.310
-[Rick] Oh, buddy.
Look at this.
-Whoa. Whoa.

52:50.793 --> 52:52.827
[both chuckling]

52:56.275 --> 52:58.724
[narrator]
To get his mining career
back on track,

52:59.379 --> 53:02.103
Rick has sold
his late mom's house

53:02.103 --> 53:06.206
and signed his camp over
to landowner, Troy Taylor.

53:07.103 --> 53:08.793
Ooh.

53:08.793 --> 53:12.379
[narrator] He desperately
wants gold by the end
of the week.

53:12.379 --> 53:15.448
To do it,
he needs to find a loader.

53:15.448 --> 53:17.275
There's a lot of snow
to move yet, so...

53:17.275 --> 53:20.862
We [bleep] need one to get
down to Monster Red right now.

53:20.862 --> 53:23.965
All's I know is the sooner
we get gold coming in,

53:23.965 --> 53:26.482
the sooner I can start [bleep]
building this company,
you know?

53:26.482 --> 53:27.758
Yeah.

53:31.068 --> 53:32.793
[narrator] Rick's meeting
Craig Steppler

53:32.793 --> 53:34.965
and Lando Bayliss,

53:34.965 --> 53:37.137
who run a small
mining operation

53:37.137 --> 53:39.137
20 miles from his claim.

53:40.103 --> 53:41.758
[Rick] There you are.

53:44.862 --> 53:46.896
-Craig, how you doing, buddy?
-Not bad. Yourself?

53:46.896 --> 53:48.103
Good to see you.

53:48.103 --> 53:49.379
-This is Zee.
-Hey, Zee.

53:49.379 --> 53:50.551
What's going on?
Nice to meet you.

53:50.551 --> 53:52.448
Yeah. That's Lando.

53:53.379 --> 53:56.000
-[Zee] From Star Wars?
-[chuckling]

53:56.000 --> 53:57.586
-[Rick] Lando,
how you doing, buddy?
-How's it going?

53:57.586 --> 53:58.896
Good to see you. This is Zee.

53:58.896 --> 54:01.103
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

54:01.103 --> 54:03.379
-[Rick] Nice little spot
you got here.
-Yeah. She does the trick.

54:03.379 --> 54:05.793
[Rick] So I know I explained
a bit on the phone.

54:05.793 --> 54:07.379
We got a lot of snow to move

54:07.379 --> 54:09.379
and we'd like to get
the plant running too.

54:09.379 --> 54:11.482
Really, we need to get going.
I got nothing.

54:11.482 --> 54:13.655
So I am looking for a loader.

54:13.655 --> 54:15.241
-Yeah.
-[Rick] So,
it's a short-term thing.

54:15.241 --> 54:16.862
You know, I'm hoping
maybe in a couple weeks.

54:16.862 --> 54:20.034
-[Craig] I got
three loaders here.
-Yeah.

54:20.034 --> 54:22.862
But two are kind of only
operational right now.

54:22.862 --> 54:24.689
I don't know. We can go
take a look at them I guess.

54:24.689 --> 54:26.586
-[Lando] Yeah.
-[Rick] Cool.

54:26.586 --> 54:28.103
All right.

54:28.103 --> 54:30.241
Well, there's this older
one sitting over here.

54:33.551 --> 54:35.379
-[Rick] Oh, this thing runs?
-[Craig] Oh, yeah.

54:35.379 --> 54:37.586
-[Rick laughs]
-[Craig] Runs for now.

54:37.586 --> 54:39.068
[Rick] Oh, yeah.

54:40.275 --> 54:41.310
What size buckets on it?

54:42.000 --> 54:43.241
[Craig]
It's about a five-yard bucket.

54:43.241 --> 54:44.344
[Rick] That ain't too bad.

54:49.241 --> 54:52.034
I don't know what you're
looking to deal on it for?

54:52.034 --> 54:55.413
Well, we could probably let it
go for about $100 an hour.

55:03.137 --> 55:05.172
-$100 an hour seems fair.
-Yeah.

55:05.172 --> 55:06.586
I'm a little
cash-wrapped right now.

55:06.586 --> 55:08.172
I got a little bit
of gold left on me

55:08.172 --> 55:10.034
from last season,
so how about I just hand you

55:10.034 --> 55:12.068
like say five ounces
of gold right now?

55:12.068 --> 55:14.758
[narrator] Worth $10,000.

55:15.586 --> 55:18.655
It should give Rick
two weeks running.

55:20.862 --> 55:23.758
Yeah. We could probably do
something like that. Yeah.

55:23.758 --> 55:25.862
Okay.

55:25.862 --> 55:27.137
Look, I weighed it
out this morning.

55:27.137 --> 55:28.689
It's chunky gold.
I'm down to stuff

55:28.689 --> 55:30.241
that I didn't really
wanna let go, but...

55:31.551 --> 55:33.482
it's all...
It's all Keno gold here.

55:33.482 --> 55:34.689
-[Craig] Oh, yeah.
-[Rick] And, yeah,

55:34.689 --> 55:36.241
just got her weighed it out.

55:37.758 --> 55:39.965
Well, five ounces of gold
gets this loader.

55:39.965 --> 55:41.241
-[Craig] Perfect.
-[Rick] Beauty.

55:41.241 --> 55:42.482
[Craig] Sounds good.

55:42.482 --> 55:44.172
-[Zee] Got a loader.
-[Rick] Got a loader, buddy.

55:44.172 --> 55:45.344
[chuckles]

55:49.000 --> 55:50.586
I've got a lot of gold
to get this season running,

55:50.586 --> 55:51.655
got a lot to make up for.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.379
Troy Taylor owns my camp.

55:54.379 --> 55:55.586
Right now, I wanna get
gold coming in

55:55.586 --> 55:57.379
as fast as possible
so I can get my camp back

55:57.379 --> 56:00.241
and then start moving towards
making a profit this year.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.275
First things first,
get some of the snow cleared

56:07.275 --> 56:09.034
and get to the plant

56:09.034 --> 56:10.655
and make sure
we get it running right away.

56:11.793 --> 56:14.241
We've got a stockpile
of pay up at the plant,

56:14.241 --> 56:17.068
and I'm pumped.

56:18.758 --> 56:20.379
[narrator] Two years ago,

56:20.379 --> 56:24.275
Rick dug down 190 feet
into Rally Valley,

56:24.275 --> 56:26.241
removing over a million yards

56:26.241 --> 56:28.275
of overburden
to recover nearly

56:28.275 --> 56:31.896
$2.5 million in gold,

56:31.896 --> 56:35.586
before he was forced
to abandon it.

56:35.586 --> 56:39.896
During the process,
Rick set aside
a month's worth of pay dirt

56:39.896 --> 56:41.655
in two stockpiles.

56:42.344 --> 56:44.758
One next to Monster Red

56:46.172 --> 56:49.620
and another 1,700 feet away.

56:51.275 --> 56:53.551
It's a quick score
that Rick needs

56:53.551 --> 56:56.551
to fuel his comeback
operation.

56:58.034 --> 57:00.448
Jumping back in the seat,
it feels good.

57:03.586 --> 57:05.000
Yeah!

57:06.896 --> 57:09.448
[Zee] Two years away,
we're starting
from scratch again.

57:10.689 --> 57:13.344
Rick seems focused
and ready to go.

57:13.344 --> 57:16.965
This is probably the most
motivated that I've seen him,
which is great.

57:16.965 --> 57:20.827
This is old Rick, but with,
you know, new outlook.

57:25.896 --> 57:27.034
Old buddy.

57:28.379 --> 57:30.034
Quasi.

57:30.034 --> 57:31.448
[chuckles]

57:33.793 --> 57:36.586
I mean, everything
looks good on the surface.

57:36.586 --> 57:38.862
I mean, we got to look
a little closer, but,

57:38.862 --> 57:41.344
you know, so far, so good.
What are you thinking
there, bud?

57:41.344 --> 57:44.482
Some valve handles
missing, bent, but...

57:44.482 --> 57:46.275
[Rick] I'm half-tempted
to just get this thing

57:46.275 --> 57:48.103
hooked up to power,
get it shaking.

57:48.103 --> 57:49.344
See if everything's
good there.

57:49.344 --> 57:50.793
I mean, we gotta put
the sluice box together,

57:50.793 --> 57:52.172
and get it all iron it in,

57:52.172 --> 57:54.896
but then we can put
water to it.

57:54.896 --> 57:57.344
I guess, let's just go take
a look at the pump.

57:58.241 --> 57:59.758
Right where I left it.

58:02.034 --> 58:03.689
Yeah.

58:03.689 --> 58:04.896
So, we'll just need a flange,

58:04.896 --> 58:07.551
which I have those,

58:07.551 --> 58:10.931
and then our suction line.

58:11.482 --> 58:12.896
-All right.
-Speaking of that,

58:12.896 --> 58:14.724
where the [bleep]
is the suction line?

58:15.896 --> 58:18.172
[Zee] Would you have
left it right here?

58:18.172 --> 58:19.793
Well, no, I [bleep] know
I left it right here.

58:19.793 --> 58:21.689
We drug it up here
with the suction line

58:21.689 --> 58:24.172
and set it right behind...

58:24.172 --> 58:26.103
Either right here or right
[bleep] behind it.

58:27.172 --> 58:29.586
[bleep].

58:29.586 --> 58:32.655
[narrator] The filtration
basket and suction line

58:32.655 --> 58:34.344
pulls water from the river

58:34.344 --> 58:36.482
and sends it
to the wash plant

58:36.482 --> 58:39.034
where the gold is separated
from the dirt.

58:39.896 --> 58:41.275
Without them,

58:41.275 --> 58:43.241
Rick's dead in the water.

58:45.103 --> 58:46.827
Who the [bleep]
would've came down here?

58:47.896 --> 58:50.448
It didn't grow [bleep] legs,
someone took it out of here.

58:51.896 --> 58:53.241
[bleep].

58:53.241 --> 58:54.793
I'm sure like anything
else up here,

58:54.793 --> 58:56.586
it ain't cheap.
So what does that go for?

58:56.586 --> 58:58.793
Two ten-foot lengths
and a [bleep] basket,

58:58.793 --> 59:00.689
that's about 15 grand.
Yeah. That's not--

59:00.689 --> 59:03.034
Like I got 15 [bleep] grand
to buy another one.

59:03.034 --> 59:05.689
Not a [bleep] chance.

59:05.689 --> 59:08.413
No, somebody knew
what the [bleep] it was,
and they left with it.

59:09.586 --> 59:11.103
They were motivated too,
'cause it's not something

59:11.103 --> 59:12.827
you throw in
the back of a pickup.

59:16.137 --> 59:18.000
Dude, I don't know what
to [bleep] say about that.

59:18.482 --> 59:19.758
I think you know me.

59:19.758 --> 59:21.172
I don't live
in a [bleep] world
where people help theirself

59:21.172 --> 59:22.896
to other people's
[bleep], man.

59:22.896 --> 59:24.965
Yeah. This is [bleep] up.

59:26.896 --> 59:28.379
I'm gonna try [bleep]
tracking it down

59:28.379 --> 59:30.482
before I order another one.

59:30.482 --> 59:33.379
-[sighs]
-[Rick] Man, we can't sluice
without it.

59:33.379 --> 59:36.000
-Let's go [bleep] find it.
-All right.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.827
[dramatic music playing]

59:47.551 --> 59:50.034
[Tony speaking]

59:50.034 --> 59:53.137
[narrator] Nearly a week
into the mining season,

59:53.137 --> 59:55.896
Tony Beets' oldest son,
Kevin,

59:55.896 --> 59:58.482
is still nowhere to be seen.

59:58.482 --> 01:00:00.689
-[Tony speaking]
-[Minnie] Hey, how are you?

01:00:00.689 --> 01:00:02.034
[Tony speaking]

01:00:04.793 --> 01:00:06.620
No, I haven't.

01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:12.241
[Faith] Hi.

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:13.896
We can't see you.

01:00:13.896 --> 01:00:15.344
[Minnie] We can see you.

01:00:15.344 --> 01:00:17.034
You can't see us?

01:00:17.034 --> 01:00:18.793
-[Kevin] No, no, no. Not Tony.
-[Faith] No. Tony's like
all the way in the corner.

01:00:18.793 --> 01:00:20.275
-[Kevin] There we go.
-[Faith] Yeah.

01:00:22.758 --> 01:00:24.206
[Kevin] You're used to that
at this point.

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:27.206
So how's everything going on
the hill right now?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.793
-[Faith] Well--
-[Tony speaking]

01:00:33.793 --> 01:00:35.689
We've been thinking
that perhaps

01:00:35.689 --> 01:00:37.034
this year we might
take it off.

01:00:41.896 --> 01:00:43.172
Like we just got the house.

01:00:43.172 --> 01:00:44.689
We'd like to actually
do something with it.

01:00:49.793 --> 01:00:52.000
[Faith] Yeah.
Decent amount of gardening,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.758
kind of fixing up the house.

01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:08.482
Yeah. I know.
You gotta be covered.

01:01:08.482 --> 01:01:11.448
Things change. It's...
You have no choice sometimes.

01:01:13.896 --> 01:01:15.034
-Have a good season.
-[Minnie] Oh, we will.

01:01:15.034 --> 01:01:16.758
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:01:18.551 --> 01:01:20.206
[Tony speaking]

01:01:24.413 --> 01:01:27.275
That's right. We'll just
have to make it work anyway.

01:01:27.965 --> 01:01:30.000
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

01:01:45.172 --> 01:01:47.758
[narrator] Kevin's absence
leaves a gaping hole

01:01:47.758 --> 01:01:49.689
in Tony's operation.

01:01:50.793 --> 01:01:54.344
[Tony speaking]

01:01:58.068 --> 01:02:01.137
[Tony speaking]

01:02:06.482 --> 01:02:08.413
[narrator]
At the end of last season...

01:02:08.413 --> 01:02:11.034
Holy [bleep] Tony.
The trommel is [bleep].

01:02:11.034 --> 01:02:13.551
[narrator] After nearly
30 years of hard running...

01:02:13.551 --> 01:02:15.482
[Tony speaking]

01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:17.413
[narrator]
Tony's gold-catching trommel

01:02:17.413 --> 01:02:20.103
suffered a catastrophic
breakdown.

01:02:20.793 --> 01:02:21.965
[Tony speaking]

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:26.896
[narrator]
Getting it working again

01:02:26.896 --> 01:02:30.517
is critical
for a successful season.

01:02:30.517 --> 01:02:35.620
Tony needs to move the broken
40-ton, 40-foot-long trommel

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:38.517
to a welding tent
for urgent repairs.

01:02:42.103 --> 01:02:45.896
[Tony speaking]

01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:48.862
[narrator]
Mike takes charge of the 950,

01:02:48.862 --> 01:02:51.103
Monica, the 750.

01:02:51.103 --> 01:02:54.689
Two of the biggest excavators
in the Yukon.

01:02:54.689 --> 01:02:56.241
I don't know who drove
this last but I am not

01:02:56.241 --> 01:02:57.758
as tall as them.

01:03:00.896 --> 01:03:02.586
-Yeah?
-[Tony speaking]

01:03:05.551 --> 01:03:07.482
[Tony speaking]

01:03:09.862 --> 01:03:13.137
You know, my parents had us
running equipment

01:03:13.137 --> 01:03:16.448
since we were 12,
13 years old.

01:03:16.448 --> 01:03:18.965
We didn't really get
a chance to explore

01:03:18.965 --> 01:03:20.689
other things we might like.

01:03:20.689 --> 01:03:24.413
So Kevin taking this time off

01:03:24.413 --> 01:03:26.103
to figure that out
for himself,

01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:28.310
I think is absolutely amazing.

01:03:33.344 --> 01:03:36.137
[Mike] I don't know why
my brother decided
not to come here this year.

01:03:36.137 --> 01:03:37.758
It's a shame
when you lose someone.

01:03:37.758 --> 01:03:40.551
But I have a saying,
everyone's expendable.

01:03:40.551 --> 01:03:41.586
Everyone.

01:03:48.103 --> 01:03:51.034
[Tony speaking]

01:04:08.793 --> 01:04:10.551
[Tony speaking]

01:04:12.689 --> 01:04:14.758
[Monica] The last two years,
I've been staying home

01:04:14.758 --> 01:04:16.689
with my sweet small child.

01:04:16.689 --> 01:04:19.068
It's nice being back at work,
you know,

01:04:19.068 --> 01:04:20.413
speaking with adult humans.

01:04:21.689 --> 01:04:24.655
[Tony speaking]

01:04:24.655 --> 01:04:27.034
[Monica]
But there's so much yelling.

01:04:27.034 --> 01:04:28.862
Just so stressful.

01:04:28.862 --> 01:04:31.172
[Tony speaking]

01:04:36.586 --> 01:04:39.931
[Tony speaking]

01:04:45.241 --> 01:04:50.586
[Tony speaking]

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:54.103
[narrator] Now, the race is on
to get their trommel

01:04:54.103 --> 01:04:56.551
up and running
and back on the gold.

01:04:56.551 --> 01:04:58.206
[Tony speaking]

01:05:08.689 --> 01:05:11.758
[dramatic music playing]

01:05:30.517 --> 01:05:32.000
Yeah. This is Rick Ness.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.620
Yeah, I think you got
something of mine.

01:05:35.275 --> 01:05:37.310
Listen, I [bleep] know
that you took

01:05:37.310 --> 01:05:39.275
my [bleep] 10-inch
suction line, all right?

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:42.310
No. I [bleep] know.
No. Hey, listen. No...

01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:44.137
Hey. No, you [bleep] listen.

01:05:44.137 --> 01:05:45.965
[narrator]
After asking around,

01:05:45.965 --> 01:05:47.758
Rick Ness has discovered

01:05:47.758 --> 01:05:51.551
a neighboring miner
stole his only suction line

01:05:51.551 --> 01:05:55.241
that feeds vital water
to his wash plant.

01:05:55.241 --> 01:05:59.000
Without it, Rick has no hope
of getting on the gold.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
[Rick] All right? You took
something that [bleep]

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.379
belongs to me
and I [bleep] want it back.

01:06:03.379 --> 01:06:05.655
[bleep] this [bleep].

01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:11.482
Zee!

01:06:12.172 --> 01:06:13.551
-Yo, Zee.
-[Zee] Yeah.

01:06:13.551 --> 01:06:15.379
You're not gonna
[bleep] believe this.

01:06:17.413 --> 01:06:18.758
-I found the suction line.
-Where?

01:06:18.758 --> 01:06:21.758
Some [bleep] on the other side
of the [bleep] mountain
took it.

01:06:21.758 --> 01:06:23.000
I went and talked
to [bleep] Kyle.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.896
-You remember Kyle?
He worked for me last--
-[Zee] Yeah.

01:06:24.896 --> 01:06:26.655
And, you know,
he says this guy

01:06:26.655 --> 01:06:28.275
was poking around, looking
for a 10-inch suction line,

01:06:28.275 --> 01:06:29.206
and he saw him.

01:06:29.206 --> 01:06:30.551
He [bleep] saw him on site.

01:06:30.551 --> 01:06:32.896
-[Zee] He just took it?
-Yeah. He just
[bleep] took it.

01:06:32.896 --> 01:06:34.551
I tell you what, dude, I...

01:06:34.551 --> 01:06:36.000
[sighs]
Not a whole lot gets me going,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.241
but a [bleep] thief, man...

01:06:37.241 --> 01:06:38.275
Yeah, I'm gonna go
[bleep] get it.

01:06:38.275 --> 01:06:41.413
[suspenseful music playing]

01:06:44.517 --> 01:06:47.689
[engine revving]

01:06:56.482 --> 01:06:59.689
-Who are you guys?
-[man] [bleep].

01:06:59.689 --> 01:07:00.965
Are you [bleep] kidding me?

01:07:01.896 --> 01:07:03.758
I'll turn around.
You can follow me down there.

01:07:17.965 --> 01:07:19.482
I'm trying to keep
my [bleep] together right now

01:07:19.482 --> 01:07:20.689
because I just saw it
on the trailer

01:07:20.689 --> 01:07:22.034
and it's all [bleep] up.

01:07:22.034 --> 01:07:23.137
It's all [bleep] smashed.

01:07:23.137 --> 01:07:25.172
[bleep],
it's all [bleep] smashed.

01:07:25.172 --> 01:07:26.482
If this thing's
[bleep] unusable,

01:07:26.482 --> 01:07:27.965
I'm driving straight
out there.

01:07:27.965 --> 01:07:29.758
I'm gonna knock
his [bleep] teeth out.

01:07:42.689 --> 01:07:44.172
Are you [bleep] kidding me?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.379
[chuckles]

01:07:46.379 --> 01:07:47.896
This is ridiculous.

01:07:47.896 --> 01:07:49.379
It's [bleep] destroyed.

01:07:49.379 --> 01:07:50.965
-[man] Destroyed?
-It's [bleep] destroyed.

01:07:50.965 --> 01:07:52.551
And that [bleep] wouldn't
come out here himself.

01:07:52.551 --> 01:07:54.620
He sent two monkeys
to drop it [bleep] off.

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:56.620
It's [bleep] it's [bleep]
it's [bleep] up.

01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.137
Basket's smashed.

01:07:58.137 --> 01:08:00.310
The [bleep] hose
is [bleep] crushed flat

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:02.034
and you got [bleep]
duct tape over it.

01:08:08.344 --> 01:08:12.034
[metal clanking]

01:08:17.965 --> 01:08:20.482
[Rick] Tell your boss
I'm coming for a visit.

01:08:20.482 --> 01:08:22.412
[bleep].

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:29.965
Look at this [bleep]

01:08:33.379 --> 01:08:34.689
that's what they returned.

01:08:36.654 --> 01:08:37.654
[phone camera clicks]

01:08:37.654 --> 01:08:39.758
I'm [bleep] shaking, man.

01:08:43.482 --> 01:08:44.724
[Zee] What a [bleep] joke.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:46.620
[Rick] Why even
send this back?

01:08:48.379 --> 01:08:50.068
I don't give a [bleep], I say
we go up to him right now

01:08:50.068 --> 01:08:51.412
and [bleep] get a new one.

01:08:51.412 --> 01:08:52.792
I know. But it's... [sighs]

01:08:52.792 --> 01:08:55.103
Honestly, Let's just...
Let's think for a sec.

01:08:55.103 --> 01:08:57.136
-He owes us.
-[Zee] Yeah, I know.

01:08:57.136 --> 01:08:58.448
Honestly, that can wait.

01:08:58.448 --> 01:09:00.620
What is the safer, quicker,

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:03.654
"keep us out of jail"
option right now?

01:09:03.654 --> 01:09:05.379
I'm not [bleep]
letting it go with this guy.

01:09:05.379 --> 01:09:06.551
[Zee]
I'm not saying you should.

01:09:06.551 --> 01:09:08.654
I'm just saying, for now,

01:09:08.654 --> 01:09:10.103
let's get the safest,

01:09:10.103 --> 01:09:13.171
quickest option
to get us up and running.

01:09:13.171 --> 01:09:14.792
We can deal with that later.

01:09:14.792 --> 01:09:16.000
[groans]

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.620
[Zee] Listen, since you know
what's going on around here

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.412
and what needs to be done,
why don't you just stay here?

01:09:19.412 --> 01:09:21.586
Hopefully, someone around here

01:09:21.586 --> 01:09:23.654
has something we can borrow.

01:09:23.654 --> 01:09:25.000
I guess that's... Yeah.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.517
Another reason
why you're here.

01:09:27.517 --> 01:09:28.620
[chuckles]

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:29.895
A [bleep] smarter idea.

01:09:29.895 --> 01:09:31.241
The voice of season.

01:09:31.241 --> 01:09:33.103
[Rick groans]
[bleep] all right.

01:09:33.103 --> 01:09:34.379
I gotta stay here
and try to cool down.

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:35.654
-[Zee] All right.
-Thanks, bud.

01:09:35.654 --> 01:09:36.689
[Zee] All right.

01:09:40.586 --> 01:09:42.274
[Rick] You know what?
I need to cool down.

01:09:42.274 --> 01:09:43.862
I got plenty to do here.

01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:47.068
I'm gonna deal with this
[bleep] jack later.

01:09:57.379 --> 01:10:00.000
[dramatic music playing]

01:10:13.931 --> 01:10:15.689
Oh, that's a nice one.

01:10:15.689 --> 01:10:19.068
[narrator] On a mission to get
gold by the end of the week

01:10:19.068 --> 01:10:23.000
to fund his comeback,
Rick is down a suction line,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.517
damaged by
a neighboring miner.

01:10:26.137 --> 01:10:27.000
[Zee] You got a copy?

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.448
[narrator]
Buddy Zee is offsite

01:10:29.448 --> 01:10:31.413
trying to source
a replacement.

01:10:31.413 --> 01:10:32.862
Yeah. Go for it Rick.

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:34.034
[Zee] Man, I got a hose.

01:10:34.034 --> 01:10:35.655
Are you down by the excavator

01:10:35.655 --> 01:10:37.517
to pull this thing off
or what?

01:10:37.517 --> 01:10:39.413
No. I'm in the sluice box,
but you got the hose,

01:10:39.413 --> 01:10:41.000
I'll [bleep] be there
in a second.

01:10:43.655 --> 01:10:45.620
I ended up picking
this up down the road

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:47.758
from Craig and Lando's.

01:10:47.758 --> 01:10:50.000
It's longer than
the one we had

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.137
and in way better shape.

01:10:51.137 --> 01:10:52.965
We should have Monster Red

01:10:52.965 --> 01:10:54.724
up and running in no time now.

01:10:54.724 --> 01:10:56.172
This is huge.

01:10:56.172 --> 01:10:57.620
Good job, man.

01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.206
That was better than me
going to jail.

01:10:59.206 --> 01:11:00.724
[Zee] Yeah.

01:11:00.724 --> 01:11:03.586
[narrator] Just a week after
returning to the Yukon,

01:11:03.586 --> 01:11:06.931
Rick is ready to fire up
Monster Red

01:11:06.931 --> 01:11:10.275
and start sluicing
the Rally Valley pay piles.

01:11:10.275 --> 01:11:13.482
[metal clanking]

01:11:15.793 --> 01:11:18.793
Slammed it right up there,
perfect on the first time,
the first shot.

01:11:19.551 --> 01:11:20.827
Every now and then,

01:11:21.931 --> 01:11:23.000
things line up.

01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:26.724
I'm gonna take it
as a good sign.

01:11:28.137 --> 01:11:31.758
[bleep] Zee is good,
just the best.

01:11:43.206 --> 01:11:45.310
-It's in.
-She's in.

01:11:46.275 --> 01:11:47.172
You know what that means?

01:11:47.724 --> 01:11:48.793
[Zee] Get sluicing, right?

01:11:48.793 --> 01:11:49.965
It should water the plant,

01:11:49.965 --> 01:11:51.172
put dirt in the plant,

01:11:51.172 --> 01:11:53.068
and then
we see gold in the plant.

01:11:53.068 --> 01:11:54.931
[Zee] All good things.

01:11:54.931 --> 01:11:57.206
It's been too [bleep] long.
I need to see some gold.

01:11:58.241 --> 01:12:01.379
[machine rumbling]

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
We're gonna run some [bleep]
dirt and get some gold.

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:15.793
The nuggets are just raging.

01:12:15.793 --> 01:12:16.931
The sluice boxes are even.

01:12:16.931 --> 01:12:17.862
Let's put some power to it.

01:12:20.206 --> 01:12:23.068
[machine rumbling]

01:12:23.068 --> 01:12:24.275
[Rick] Oh, isn't that smooth?

01:12:24.275 --> 01:12:25.896
Smooth, smooth, smooth.

01:12:25.896 --> 01:12:27.310
[bleep] yeah.

01:12:30.448 --> 01:12:32.931
I hope you don't mind,
but I'm gonna take
the first few scoops in.

01:12:32.931 --> 01:12:34.275
[Zee] That's fine.

01:12:34.275 --> 01:12:35.620
I'll watch.

01:12:36.896 --> 01:12:38.344
But [bleep], it's running,
we got power.

01:12:38.344 --> 01:12:40.551
The plant's shaking.
Conveyor's on.

01:12:40.551 --> 01:12:42.000
Feeder's on.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.689
You can see they have dirt.

01:12:43.689 --> 01:12:49.827
Holy [bleep] holy [bleep]
oh, baby.

01:12:49.827 --> 01:12:52.000
[narrator]
After a year off from mining,

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.689
Rick is one step closer
to getting gold

01:12:55.689 --> 01:12:59.137
and getting his life
back on track.

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:02.275
[Rick]
First scoop of the year, boys.

01:13:02.931 --> 01:13:05.068
Oh, my [bleep].

01:13:07.344 --> 01:13:08.275
This is awesome.

01:13:08.275 --> 01:13:09.965
I mean, it's just been
Zee and I up here,

01:13:09.965 --> 01:13:12.413
and we literally got
everything in place.

01:13:12.413 --> 01:13:13.931
We got Monster Red running.

01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:16.000
We got gold in the box
a long time

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.241
before anybody
else in this valley

01:13:17.241 --> 01:13:18.655
or anywhere near here.

01:13:18.655 --> 01:13:19.758
You don't wanna fight
Mother Nature

01:13:19.758 --> 01:13:21.000
in the [bleep] snow
and the ice,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.206
but here it is, baby.

01:13:22.206 --> 01:13:23.551
This is the payoff.

01:13:27.482 --> 01:13:30.620
[suspenseful music playing]

01:13:31.862 --> 01:13:34.655
[helicopter blades whirring]

01:13:41.448 --> 01:13:42.965
[Parker] All right.
Are we ready to rock?

01:13:42.965 --> 01:13:44.068
[Nona]
We're ready to rock and roll.

01:13:44.068 --> 01:13:47.206
[helicopter blades whirring]

01:13:52.241 --> 01:13:55.000
[narrator] Parker Schnabel
has less than a week

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.379
to decide whether
to gamble $15 million

01:13:58.379 --> 01:14:00.896
on new ground
at Dominion Creek,

01:14:01.482 --> 01:14:03.172
a deal that would make him

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:06.034
one of the largest landowners
in the Klondike

01:14:06.034 --> 01:14:07.758
at just 28 years old.

01:14:09.655 --> 01:14:11.241
[Parker] I haven't really
had a good chance

01:14:11.241 --> 01:14:13.206
to have a proper look
at the ground yet,

01:14:13.206 --> 01:14:16.000
so it'll be good
to have a view of the property

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.413
and kind of see what's been
mined and what hasn't.

01:14:19.586 --> 01:14:21.000
There's Liam's drill lines.

01:14:22.931 --> 01:14:25.724
And the dredge
is right ahead of us.

01:14:25.724 --> 01:14:27.482
Yeah.

01:14:27.482 --> 01:14:31.103
[narrator] To get insight
into this historic ground,

01:14:31.103 --> 01:14:33.689
Parker's brought
along Nona Loveless,

01:14:33.689 --> 01:14:38.241
a seasoned miner who now
manages his operation.

01:14:38.241 --> 01:14:42.206
I was here in this area
mining with my dad

01:14:42.206 --> 01:14:45.793
way back in early '80.

01:14:46.241 --> 01:14:47.655
And how did it go?

01:14:47.655 --> 01:14:49.689
Uh, the first year
was horrible.

01:14:50.344 --> 01:14:52.068
We were very defeated.

01:14:52.068 --> 01:14:56.034
But the second year
was better.

01:14:56.034 --> 01:14:59.310
After a couple seasons here,
did you have a feel

01:14:59.310 --> 01:15:01.206
like the ground's
pretty decent?

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:03.689
I would...

01:15:03.689 --> 01:15:06.551
Yes, if we had continued
leasing more ground,

01:15:06.551 --> 01:15:09.241
I felt like we would've
been successful.

01:15:13.448 --> 01:15:17.448
This is a big
undertaking for sure,
this piece of land here.

01:15:17.448 --> 01:15:19.551
That's a big decision,
eh, Parker?

01:15:19.551 --> 01:15:22.000
[Parker] Yeah. Yeah.
There's a lot to figure out.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.137
It's a 10-minute
helicopter ride.

01:15:24.137 --> 01:15:25.413
[laughs]
That's a lot of ground.

01:15:25.413 --> 01:15:27.137
[Nona] That's a lot of ground.

01:15:27.137 --> 01:15:28.689
A lot of ground.

01:15:29.586 --> 01:15:30.931
Hopefully, Liam comes through

01:15:30.931 --> 01:15:32.620
and says there's
a pile of gold there

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.862
and we can take it on.

01:15:43.103 --> 01:15:46.241
[suspenseful music playing]

01:15:51.758 --> 01:15:53.000
Morning.

01:15:53.724 --> 01:15:55.413
I got... I got all these

01:15:55.413 --> 01:15:57.310
but I don't know
what I'm looking at.

01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:59.448
-It's quite the book,
isn't it?
-You've been busy.

01:16:00.413 --> 01:16:02.137
[narrator]
Parker has just two days

01:16:02.137 --> 01:16:06.241
to decide
if he wants to gamble
all the money he's made

01:16:06.241 --> 01:16:08.379
on buying Dominion Creek.

01:16:09.689 --> 01:16:10.862
And you wanna see it
on the map?

01:16:10.862 --> 01:16:12.413
-[Parker] Yeah.
-Yeah, I'll pull it up

01:16:12.413 --> 01:16:16.689
on the computer and that might
make it clear for you.

01:16:16.689 --> 01:16:21.000
[narrator] Liam has created
a map of the test
drill results

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.034
of gold deposits on Dominion.

01:16:27.655 --> 01:16:29.482
[Liam] So this is all the new
drilling that we did

01:16:29.482 --> 01:16:31.827
-up top here.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:16:31.827 --> 01:16:35.241
[Liam] And this is all
of the old, historic drilling
that we mapped

01:16:35.241 --> 01:16:37.137
in the same program.

01:16:37.551 --> 01:16:38.620
Green is good.

01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:40.034
Red is bad.

01:16:40.034 --> 01:16:41.448
Traffic light system.

01:16:43.482 --> 01:16:46.655
So you actually have a pretty
well-defined pay streak, huh?

01:16:46.655 --> 01:16:49.034
Yeah. It turned out
pretty good.

01:16:49.034 --> 01:16:51.655
It seems a little
narrower up top

01:16:51.655 --> 01:16:53.896
than what they were
finding down below,

01:16:53.896 --> 01:16:55.896
but one of the upsides of that

01:16:55.896 --> 01:16:57.206
is it seems
a little bit richer.

01:16:57.206 --> 01:16:58.517
Mmm-hmm.

01:17:03.413 --> 01:17:04.896
Pull back up to here.

01:17:06.793 --> 01:17:09.034
Okay.
So that's like quite good.

01:17:09.034 --> 01:17:11.827
There's 200 milligram
holes right next
to each other there.

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:14.344
[Liam] Yeah.
In the same line. 122.

01:17:17.586 --> 01:17:19.172
[Parker] That's a hell
of a line.

01:17:20.724 --> 01:17:23.000
Yeah. Textbook.

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:27.344
[Parker] We have never really
gotten much of a chance

01:17:27.344 --> 01:17:28.896
to mine a ground like this.

01:17:28.896 --> 01:17:31.931
[dramatic music playing]

01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:35.379
[narrator] Before Parker
does the deal,

01:17:35.379 --> 01:17:40.379
he wants to find one cut
that will deliver
10,000 ounces,

01:17:40.379 --> 01:17:44.931
$20 million, that would cover
mining costs

01:17:44.931 --> 01:17:48.137
and the $15 million
price tag.

01:17:50.103 --> 01:17:53.206
If it goes 0.0035 ounces
a square foot,

01:17:53.206 --> 01:17:54.517
there would be 40,000...

01:17:54.517 --> 01:17:56.206
Almost 41,000 ounces.

01:17:56.862 --> 01:17:58.000
[Liam] That's a lot.

01:17:59.551 --> 01:18:01.310
Yeah.

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:04.655
[narrator] If it does
pay out 40,000 ounces,

01:18:04.655 --> 01:18:07.724
it would be worth
$80 million,

01:18:07.724 --> 01:18:11.482
and that's just one area
on the property.

01:18:11.482 --> 01:18:15.000
It's probably,
in the long-term, a good deal,

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.103
but it's something
that not many people can...

01:18:19.137 --> 01:18:21.310
-Can pull off.
-Right.

01:18:27.172 --> 01:18:28.689
Okay.

01:18:28.689 --> 01:18:30.689
-Can you send this all to me?
-Yup.

01:18:30.689 --> 01:18:32.724
[Parker] 'Cause I need to
make a decision here

01:18:32.724 --> 01:18:34.034
in the next few days.

01:18:35.068 --> 01:18:36.000
Thanks.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.620
No problem.

01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:39.310
-You can keep that.
-[Parker] All right.

01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:40.586
It'll just be in here.

01:18:42.034 --> 01:18:43.344
-Thanks, Liam.
-[Liam] See you, Parker.

01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:44.689
[Parker] Have fun out there.

01:18:47.206 --> 01:18:48.862
[Liam] It's a little bit
out of my league.

01:18:48.862 --> 01:18:50.206
That's a lot of money.

01:18:50.206 --> 01:18:52.620
I don't know.
It's pretty scary.

01:18:54.758 --> 01:18:56.241
I'm sick of
like jumping around

01:18:56.241 --> 01:18:57.620
and hunting for ground.

01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:59.137
It's little blocks
here and there,

01:18:59.137 --> 01:19:01.620
and it'd be nice to just...

01:19:02.551 --> 01:19:04.862
spend our way out
of that problem.

01:19:06.551 --> 01:19:09.724
But you spend a lot of money
and all of a sudden,

01:19:09.724 --> 01:19:11.758
you're in a situation where
everything has to go perfect,

01:19:11.758 --> 01:19:13.379
and in this business,

01:19:13.379 --> 01:19:14.896
not all things go perfect.

01:19:16.482 --> 01:19:19.586
[dramatic music playing]

01:19:24.896 --> 01:19:27.586
[Tony speaking]

01:19:43.275 --> 01:19:45.000
[Minnie] Tony, do you copy?

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.034
[Tony speaking]

01:19:46.034 --> 01:19:47.793
[Minnie] Can you come
to the office please?

01:19:48.172 --> 01:19:49.724
[Tony speaking]

01:19:54.931 --> 01:19:56.172
-[Tony speaking]
-[Minnie] Hey.

01:19:56.172 --> 01:19:58.241
Well, I have
some news for you.

01:19:58.241 --> 01:19:59.931
You might like this.

01:20:00.827 --> 01:20:02.862
I just got a call.

01:20:02.862 --> 01:20:05.758
[Minnie] We got an amendment
through our license.

01:20:09.827 --> 01:20:12.413
And we're good to go
to the Indian River.

01:20:15.137 --> 01:20:16.758
[Tony speaking]

01:20:18.448 --> 01:20:19.517
[laughter]

01:20:19.517 --> 01:20:22.103
I'm christening
you Minnie's ATM.

01:20:23.034 --> 01:20:24.862
[narrator] 40 miles Southeast

01:20:24.862 --> 01:20:26.275
from Paradise Hill,

01:20:26.275 --> 01:20:29.344
Tony has over 5,000 acres

01:20:29.344 --> 01:20:31.344
of prime Yukon real estate

01:20:31.344 --> 01:20:33.655
on the legendary
Indian River.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.827
[narrator] In five seasons,

01:20:39.827 --> 01:20:43.758
the family hauled in
over 11,000 ounces...

01:20:45.275 --> 01:20:49.034
[narrator] Today worth
over $22 million.

01:20:51.172 --> 01:20:53.103
But four years ago...

01:20:53.103 --> 01:20:55.137
We don't have a long license.

01:20:55.137 --> 01:20:57.206
[narrator]
Tony lost his license,

01:20:57.206 --> 01:20:59.793
freezing him out
from the richest ground

01:20:59.793 --> 01:21:00.965
he's ever mined.

01:21:03.827 --> 01:21:06.517
[narrator] Now, an amendment
to a license

01:21:06.517 --> 01:21:08.724
has put Indian River's
treasures

01:21:08.724 --> 01:21:12.379
back within Tony's grasp,
and means the Beets

01:21:12.379 --> 01:21:15.448
could face their biggest
season ever.

01:21:25.241 --> 01:21:26.896
We bought all
the equipment, so...

01:21:28.241 --> 01:21:29.379
[Minnie] Yeah.

01:21:32.379 --> 01:21:33.586
We are ready for it.

01:21:38.344 --> 01:21:40.137
[Minnie] Okay. See you later.

01:21:41.034 --> 01:21:43.655
[Tony speaking]

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:00.206
[dramatic music playing]

01:22:01.862 --> 01:22:04.137
[Zee] Rick likes
four eggs over-easy.

01:22:04.137 --> 01:22:06.068
That's his normal breakfast.

01:22:08.448 --> 01:22:10.275
It's one less thing
he's gotta worry about.

01:22:12.689 --> 01:22:13.793
Rick!

01:22:13.793 --> 01:22:15.206
Breakfast!

01:22:15.206 --> 01:22:17.344
[Rick chuckles] Oh...

01:22:18.172 --> 01:22:19.241
[exhales]

01:22:20.655 --> 01:22:21.827
[Zee] Look at this little
piece of artwork.

01:22:21.827 --> 01:22:23.344
What is that?

01:22:23.344 --> 01:22:24.931
[Zee] It's a little like
German pancake thing.

01:22:24.931 --> 01:22:26.793
-Oh, my God.
-[Zee] [bleep] fruit.

01:22:26.793 --> 01:22:28.517
I know you don't
like fruit but--

01:22:28.517 --> 01:22:29.862
[Rick] I'll have fruit
every now and then.

01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:31.000
[Zee] What do you want
to drink?

01:22:31.379 --> 01:22:32.379
Milk.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.448
Yeah. Yeah.

01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:42.689
Still happy you came up here?

01:22:42.689 --> 01:22:43.724
Are you?

01:22:44.275 --> 01:22:45.172
[Rick] Yeah. [laughs]

01:22:45.172 --> 01:22:46.724
What'd you say?
You're happy I came up?

01:22:46.724 --> 01:22:47.793
[Rick] I said are you still
happy you came up?

01:22:47.793 --> 01:22:48.724
Oh, I thought you said,

01:22:48.724 --> 01:22:50.724
"I'm so happy
you came up here."

01:22:51.241 --> 01:22:52.827
That made me feel really good.

01:22:53.413 --> 01:22:54.344
I love you.

01:22:54.344 --> 01:22:56.586
[laughing]

01:23:08.034 --> 01:23:09.448
[Zee] We're back, baby.

01:23:09.448 --> 01:23:11.068
It's just me and Rick
though, so...

01:23:11.068 --> 01:23:13.275
It's literally
just the two of us.

01:23:14.379 --> 01:23:17.931
[narrator] Just a week
after returning to the Yukon,

01:23:17.931 --> 01:23:19.724
Rick is up and running,

01:23:19.724 --> 01:23:21.931
sluicing stockpiled pay dirt

01:23:21.931 --> 01:23:24.724
from the gold-rich
Rally Valley cut.

01:23:25.275 --> 01:23:26.413
[Rick] There is pressure here.

01:23:26.413 --> 01:23:27.724
There's no doubt about that,

01:23:27.724 --> 01:23:29.310
especially just
being two of us.

01:23:29.310 --> 01:23:30.896
But for the amount of work
that had to be done,

01:23:30.896 --> 01:23:32.310
you know, Zee and I
made quick work of it

01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:34.206
and got this plant fired up.

01:23:34.206 --> 01:23:35.965
And, quite honestly, I...

01:23:36.931 --> 01:23:39.034
I'm pretty surprised
at how the season has been.

01:23:39.551 --> 01:23:41.448
And so far, so good.

01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:46.862
Hey, Zee.

01:23:46.862 --> 01:23:48.206
You got a copy, Zee?

01:23:48.827 --> 01:23:50.310
Go ahead.

01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:51.931
[Rick] Well, what do you say,
she's been a long day.

01:23:51.931 --> 01:23:53.517
You wanna make that
the last scoop?

01:23:54.275 --> 01:23:55.517
Yeah. That's fine.

01:23:57.586 --> 01:23:59.172
[Rick] We don't got
a whole lot of time running,

01:23:59.172 --> 01:24:01.379
but we ran a fair amount
of dirt through it

01:24:01.379 --> 01:24:03.758
and I'm just excited
to see gold in the box.

01:24:03.758 --> 01:24:05.413
It's been too long.
I need to see it.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.344
[dramatic music playing]

01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:25.103
[Zee] How's she looking?

01:24:29.965 --> 01:24:32.000
[Rick] It's really [bleep]
tough to see in this box.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.482
This is just like...

01:24:33.482 --> 01:24:35.000
Here, this is
too much in here.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.413
[Rick] Yeah. Yeah.

01:24:36.413 --> 01:24:38.344
[Zee] Even I know that
and I'm an idiot.

01:24:39.896 --> 01:24:42.551
[Rick] I hope they heard
this thing shaking up and down
the valley though.

01:24:50.137 --> 01:24:51.448
[Zee] Hey, hey, hey.

01:24:51.448 --> 01:24:52.413
-There's some here.
-Is there?

01:24:52.413 --> 01:24:54.206
-[Zee] Yeah. Yeah.
-[Rick] [bleep] great.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.517
-Oh, yeah.
-Right there in the left.

01:24:58.275 --> 01:24:59.620
Look at that [bleep].

01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:02.137
[chuckles] Look at that.

01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.275
[chuckles]

01:25:04.275 --> 01:25:06.000
It ain't that big
but it's definitely a picker.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.172
-Look at that [bleep]
-[Zee] Nice.

01:25:08.172 --> 01:25:09.862
Can't beat that
for how much we ran.

01:25:09.862 --> 01:25:11.793
Hell no.

01:25:11.793 --> 01:25:13.620
This is huge, man.
I'm proud of you.

01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:15.793
Oh, [bleep] thanks, man.

01:25:15.793 --> 01:25:18.206
Seriously. It just holds
more weight this year.

01:25:18.206 --> 01:25:19.448
[Rick] Yeah.

01:25:20.413 --> 01:25:23.241
This is a long journey back.
I really needed this.

01:25:23.241 --> 01:25:24.655
I need this
to mean something, right?

01:25:24.655 --> 01:25:26.206
Right here, look at that.

01:25:26.206 --> 01:25:27.827
Who else got gold
in their box right now?

01:25:27.827 --> 01:25:29.206
[bleep] dude.

01:25:29.206 --> 01:25:30.793
I couldn't have done it
without you,

01:25:30.793 --> 01:25:32.827
so I'm glad you made the trip
up here with me.

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:34.482
Yeah. Anything for you.

01:25:34.482 --> 01:25:35.965
You've done plenty
of [bleep] for me in the past,

01:25:35.965 --> 01:25:38.137
so it was a no-brainer.
Easy decision.

01:25:38.137 --> 01:25:39.517
Well, that's
what we do, right?

01:25:40.413 --> 01:25:41.551
We got each other's backs.

01:25:41.551 --> 01:25:42.689
Yeah.

01:25:42.689 --> 01:25:44.034
I'll always have it, man.

01:25:44.034 --> 01:25:45.620
Me too.

01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:47.724
-[Zee] I appreciate that.
-You big [bleep] jerk.

01:25:47.724 --> 01:25:49.241
Oh, stop it.

01:25:49.241 --> 01:25:50.724
Now you're getting on my one
[bleep] feeling.

01:25:50.724 --> 01:25:52.034
[laughs]

01:25:52.034 --> 01:25:53.620
-[Rick] All right.
Thanks, pal.
-All right, man.

01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.379
-That's some good stuff.
-You know what?

01:25:55.379 --> 01:25:56.827
This first one, you know,
why don't you take that home?

01:25:56.827 --> 01:25:58.758
-That's yours.
-Aw.

01:25:58.758 --> 01:26:00.586
[Rick] It ain't much
but you deserve it.

01:26:00.586 --> 01:26:02.000
Aw.

01:26:05.965 --> 01:26:07.137
[Rick] That's all you get too.

01:26:07.137 --> 01:26:09.310
[laughs]

01:26:11.103 --> 01:26:13.275
[Rick] It means
a hell of a lot just to get
started like this.

01:26:13.275 --> 01:26:15.551
And, you know,
I couldn't have done this
without Zee.

01:26:15.551 --> 01:26:18.000
And, you know,
it's emotional for me
at the moment,

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.793
um, just from,
you know, what I did...

01:26:20.793 --> 01:26:22.379
What I had to do
to get back here.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.206
This is just the start.

01:26:29.482 --> 01:26:32.655
[dramatic music playing]

01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:41.137
[Parker]
It's like buying a boat.

01:26:41.137 --> 01:26:44.310
Like if you can barely afford
to buy the boat,

01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:48.000
you shouldn't have
a boat, right?

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.896
Or if you can barely afford
to buy a plane,

01:26:49.896 --> 01:26:51.172
you shouldn't have a plane.

01:26:52.068 --> 01:26:55.724
And if you can barely afford
to buy a gold mine,

01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:57.758
you shouldn't have
a gold mine,

01:26:59.206 --> 01:27:01.379
and I can barely afford to.

01:27:03.241 --> 01:27:08.827
[narrator] Parker Schnabel is
moments from making a
life-changing decision,

01:27:08.827 --> 01:27:13.000
buy a massive tract
of potentially
gold-rich ground

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.724
at a price that could
bankrupt him, or let it go.

01:27:20.965 --> 01:27:23.172
I'm kind of excited.
I'm super nervous.

01:27:23.172 --> 01:27:27.172
It's like, my approach
towards this business

01:27:27.172 --> 01:27:30.000
has been to never
be too exposed

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.068
and to keep money in the bank

01:27:33.068 --> 01:27:37.482
and be prepared
for bad weather, right?

01:27:37.482 --> 01:27:41.000
Like I've spent all this time

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.931
and all these years
trying to make some money

01:27:42.931 --> 01:27:45.344
in this business,
and we finally have...

01:27:45.344 --> 01:27:46.965
We have a young hungry crew

01:27:46.965 --> 01:27:50.344
that is just chewing
through ground like crazy.

01:27:50.344 --> 01:27:51.793
Not only is there
a ton of ground,

01:27:51.793 --> 01:27:53.689
but it's richer.

01:27:59.482 --> 01:28:00.758
I don't know.

01:28:05.931 --> 01:28:07.206
I don't know.

01:28:08.137 --> 01:28:10.034
When there's $15 million
on the line,

01:28:10.034 --> 01:28:11.793
I don't think
you can trust anybody.

01:28:13.551 --> 01:28:15.655
I guess he's just playing me

01:28:15.655 --> 01:28:18.103
to make me
make a shotgun decision.

01:28:20.586 --> 01:28:22.241
I don't know what to think.

01:28:22.241 --> 01:28:24.103
My brain is mush right now.

01:28:35.275 --> 01:28:36.965
[sigh] [bleep] me.

01:28:36.965 --> 01:28:38.551
Okay. All right.

01:28:38.551 --> 01:28:39.862
[bleep] it.

01:28:53.172 --> 01:28:54.344
Dean?

01:28:54.344 --> 01:28:55.551
[Dean] Hey, Parker. What's up?

01:28:57.689 --> 01:28:59.310
-[Parker] How are you?
-[Dean] I'm good.

01:29:01.241 --> 01:29:02.620
Um...

01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:10.000
so... I have a check.

01:29:11.448 --> 01:29:12.758
[Dean] Well,
I hope it's a big one.

01:29:12.758 --> 01:29:13.965
It is.

01:29:14.862 --> 01:29:16.758
Definitely the biggest
I've ever wrote.

01:29:16.758 --> 01:29:18.000
Um...

01:29:22.586 --> 01:29:24.655
I don't know.
Yeah, it's just...

01:29:25.482 --> 01:29:27.758
It's a lot and it's a lot
for me to process.

01:29:27.758 --> 01:29:31.620
This is only the start
of the battle for me.

01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:33.275
-Yeah.
-And you need...

01:29:33.275 --> 01:29:35.068
You need me to win
the battle as well.

01:29:35.068 --> 01:29:38.068
I need... I need to be
your biggest supporter here.

01:29:38.068 --> 01:29:39.413
I think you'll have
a good time here.

01:29:39.413 --> 01:29:41.000
I think you'll do well.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.310
The valley's paid
for everybody.

01:29:45.034 --> 01:29:47.620
You mine really well
and you'll make a go of it.

01:29:52.827 --> 01:29:54.448
Okay. Let's do it.

01:29:55.551 --> 01:29:56.724
[Dean] Thank you.

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:58.000
Congratulations.

01:29:59.172 --> 01:30:01.310
So how is this
gonna work then?

01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:03.000
I'm gonna get my toothbrush
and leave.

01:30:04.137 --> 01:30:05.896
-Yeah?
-[Dean] Yeah.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000
[narrator] Parker is now
one of the largest

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.275
and most powerful landowners

01:30:15.275 --> 01:30:17.586
in the Klondike.

01:30:17.586 --> 01:30:19.827
[Parker] Um, this all feels
super weird.

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:23.000
We've spent
the last five years

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.689
looking for a massive project
and we just got one.

01:30:24.689 --> 01:30:26.000
I should be stoked.

01:30:27.482 --> 01:30:28.724
It's just...

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.620
It's a lot of [bleep] money.
