00:26.067 --> 00:28.111
<i>Toby Fleishman awoke
in the middle of the night</i>

00:28.111 --> 00:30.071
<i>to the sound of knocking at the door.</i>

00:34.367 --> 00:35.702
Bubbles! Keep it down.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.040
Hey, who is it?

00:40.790 --> 00:42.834
It's me. Open the door.

00:42.834 --> 00:45.420
What? What's going on? What time is it?

00:45.420 --> 00:46.546
I have to talk to you.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.131
What? Did you not go home?

00:48.131 --> 00:49.799
No, I have to talk to you.
Your phone was off.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.301
Sorry, keep it down.
The kids are sleeping.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.427
I saw her.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.679
- Who? I don't understand. You...
- I saw Rachel.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.848
- Yeah.
- What?

00:58.308 --> 01:00.602
You did? Jesus.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.605
After I left here,

01:03.605 --> 01:05.356
I went downtown just to,

01:06.024 --> 01:07.400
I don't know, like walk around

01:07.400 --> 01:11.362
and I saw her just, like,
sitting there on a park bench.

01:11.821 --> 01:12.822
Hmm.

01:12.822 --> 01:13.948
I'm surprised, honestly...

01:13.948 --> 01:15.575
<i>And so I told him what happened.</i>

01:15.575 --> 01:18.828
<i>I told him about Rachel, where she was,
where she'd been.</i>

01:18.828 --> 01:20.497
It was like seeing a ghost.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.332
<i>I had left her that evening,</i>

01:23.374 --> 01:24.417
<i>with her sleeping,</i>

01:25.627 --> 01:28.421
<i>and a doctor's appointment
scheduled for the next morning.</i>

01:35.678 --> 01:36.846
Hmm.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.517
So, that's it?

01:41.684 --> 01:42.727
"That's it"?

01:43.478 --> 01:44.479
Yeah.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.440
I have work in a few hours, Lib.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.984
- Sorry, did you hear what I just said?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:50.735 --> 01:52.695
That I saw Rachel
and she was in the park and...

01:52.695 --> 01:54.823
No, I heard you. Yeah.
But we all knew she was around.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.617
She was napping in the park. She was
fucking her best friend's husband.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.244
She was bound to turn up.
It's a small town.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.454
No, Toby. She had a nervous breakdown.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.957
I know. That sounds stressful.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.003
Okay. All right, I got to get the kids
to camp in the morning.

02:09.003 --> 02:12.257
I also have a new boss and a patient
that's going off life support.

02:12.257 --> 02:15.593
Sorry. What is happening right now?

02:15.593 --> 02:17.053
She had a nervous breakdown.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.305
That's where she's been.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.266
She didn't abandon her kids.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.393
Yeah, of course she did. Where is she?

02:23.393 --> 02:25.895
I mean, she's not here. I don't see her.
Do you?

02:25.895 --> 02:28.481
- Sure. But she had a nervous breakdown.
- Yeah, I know. I heard you.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.692
She had a nervous breakdown.
Don't have to say it again.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.026
She needs help, Toby.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.153
She can hire help.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.321
She... Who are you?

02:35.905 --> 02:37.615
Seriously,
who am I talking to right now?

02:37.615 --> 02:39.617
This is the mother of your children.

02:39.617 --> 02:42.162
Yes, exactly.
But she is not my wife anymore, okay?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.621
She has, like, no relation to me.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.790
I don't have to care about her.
She's not my problem.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.167
- Not your problem?
- No.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.334
Oh, my God.

02:48.334 --> 02:51.212
Remember, it's divorce, that means
never having to say you're sorry.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.423
- Yeah.
- What?

02:53.423 --> 02:56.759
I've been through her breakdowns,
Libby. Do not worry about her, okay?

02:56.759 --> 02:58.011
She'll make it work for herself.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.721
She'll come back
monetizing the whole thing.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.514
She'll run a bank
by the time she's done with this.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.932
I don't think that you understand, okay?

03:02.932 --> 03:04.017
Yeah.

03:04.017 --> 03:08.438
She's lost time, like full weeks.
She's lost everything.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.857
She didn't lose anything.
She lost, like, a client.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.609
And she spent a few extra days at a spa

03:12.609 --> 03:14.986
when her best friend's husband
decided to stop fucking her.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.113
You know what? You're right. Sorry.
I'll make her lasagna.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.573
Toby, Jesus.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.617
Hey, you were supposed
to be on my side, okay?

03:20.617 --> 03:22.869
- You were supposed to be my friend.
- I am your friend.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.121
You're waking me up in the middle
of the night to tell me this

03:25.121 --> 03:27.790
now that I finally found a way to
move on with my sad, broken children.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.500
Because she had a nervous breakdown.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.795
- Yeah, I said stop saying that.
- Okay, fine. I won't use that word.

03:32.795 --> 03:35.215
Okay, what do you want me to say?
She can't handle her life.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.842
She's collapsed.
She can't take care of her own children

03:37.842 --> 03:40.303
because she needs to put
her own fucking oxygen mask on first.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.472
Actually, actually that thing
about oxygen masks

03:42.472 --> 03:43.848
is about airplanes, all right?

03:43.848 --> 03:46.392
It's really about adult tolerance
for oxygen deprivation.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.937
It's not a metaphor. It's not
supposed to be like a lifestyle.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.438
I'm so... I'm just like shocked.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.482
I am not going to be
the prisoner of my mistakes.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.862
This is what our ancestors died for.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.324
The right for us to be middle-aged,

04:02.200 --> 04:04.661
and bored and miserable.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.498
Yeah and shocked, okay?

04:11.459 --> 04:13.962
I'm going back to bed.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.091
Go home, Libby.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.614
<i>I could tell you
what happened to Toby then.</i>

04:42.156 --> 04:44.117
<i>I could tell you that the next morning,</i>

04:44.117 --> 04:45.618
<i>when he arrived back at the hospital</i>

04:45.618 --> 04:48.454
<i>to meet with the committees
over Karen Cooper's brain activity</i>

04:48.454 --> 04:51.082
<i>and to help David Cooper
move toward a decision,</i>

04:51.624 --> 04:54.043
<i>he was full of remorse
for his anger at the poor guy.</i>

04:56.379 --> 04:59.424
<i>What had happened to Toby
to make him so cold-hearted</i>

04:59.424 --> 05:03.803
<i>that he would lash out at a man
who had just effectively lost his wife?</i>

05:04.387 --> 05:07.015
<i>All he could think was that
he was never like that before.</i>

05:07.765 --> 05:11.352
<i>But also he had to leave room for
the fact that maybe he was.</i>

05:12.186 --> 05:14.314
<i>Maybe, like the Wilson's itself,</i>

05:14.605 --> 05:18.109
<i>everything we are
is dormant and inside us all along.</i>

05:27.994 --> 05:32.373
<i>What I could tell you is that Toby
was always reactive and angry</i>

05:32.373 --> 05:35.376
<i>and ready to blame everyone else
for his problems.</i>

05:43.843 --> 05:45.011
<i>And he was also someone</i>

05:45.011 --> 05:49.057
<i>who held even the unpreventable failures
in his heart,</i>

05:49.057 --> 05:53.186
<i>and who did not ever let a basic
and consistent fact of his job,</i>

05:53.686 --> 05:54.937
<i>which was death,</i>

05:54.937 --> 05:56.397
<i>become regular to him.</i>

06:15.792 --> 06:18.252
<i>I could tell you
that in his darkest recesses,</i>

06:18.252 --> 06:19.837
<i>Toby had some relief</i>

06:19.837 --> 06:22.590
<i>that he got to keep his job
the way that it was.</i>

06:22.965 --> 06:24.634
<i>That he fundamentally didn't understand</i>

06:24.634 --> 06:26.677
<i>why you would have to stop
doing what you loved</i>

06:26.677 --> 06:27.804
<i>in order to get ahead</i>

06:27.804 --> 06:30.848
<i>when it felt like it was ahead
to do what you loved.</i>

06:37.480 --> 06:40.066
<i>I could tell you that Toby
was focusing on making good</i>

06:40.066 --> 06:42.026
<i>on his promises to his children.</i>

06:42.026 --> 06:45.571
And so, the way the world looks
is different,

06:45.571 --> 06:47.490
depending on how you look at it.

06:47.990 --> 06:50.118
The electron cloud is uncertain,

06:50.118 --> 06:53.037
- but the nucleus is always fixed.
- Okay.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.831
Which means
it's always in the same place.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.833
It's the things around it
that move around.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.085
Now, sir, please
look into the stereoscope.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.503
Okay.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.255
There are two realities.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.799
There is the cloud of electrons
surrounding the nucleus,

07:04.799 --> 07:07.218
which is a solution
of the Schrödinger equation.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.469
That's the box they're in.

07:08.469 --> 07:11.806
And there's the physical locations
of each individual electron,

07:11.806 --> 07:14.559
which can only be determined
by measuring them directly

07:14.559 --> 07:15.726
by opening the box.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.395
And both things are true.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.899
And that is what I want to say
about superposition.

07:23.484 --> 07:24.485
That is so good.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.571
That is so good.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.780
Do you think I'll win?

07:27.780 --> 07:30.616
I can't imagine anyone
has anything better thought out,

07:31.492 --> 07:33.661
or a smarter, harder-working son.

07:36.706 --> 07:37.832
That is excellent work.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.294
Oof. Jesus.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.671
<i>I could tell you
he never got the blinds fixed.</i>

07:45.214 --> 07:48.301
<i>And despite three separate calls
to the super,</i>

07:48.301 --> 07:50.178
<i>the air-conditioner was still broken.</i>

07:51.804 --> 07:52.889
Dad, we're gonna be late.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.017
What? For what? Oh, crap. Solly, here.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.393
Solly, come on. We have to go.

07:57.393 --> 07:58.728
Come on. Come on. Come on.

08:03.774 --> 08:04.942
Sorry I'm late.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.737
Class went over a few minutes.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.530
No, of course. Of course. Thank you.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.742
Hannah, how are you doing
with your haftarah?

08:12.742 --> 08:15.453
Cantor Timberman says
you're doing very nicely on it.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.413
Oh, yeah, she's been studying every day.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.623
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.249
You don't hear that a lot.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.920
So what we could do
is just go over some logistics.

08:24.545 --> 08:28.466
I know that you're going to want
to bestow honors on your family,

08:28.466 --> 08:33.471
opening the Ark...
<i>aliyah</i> to the <i>Torah,</i> etcetera.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.765
- And I know you're planning on speaking.
- Uh-huh.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.059
And Rachel too, I presume.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.479
- That is still a question.
- Okay.

08:44.148 --> 08:48.819
Hannah, you understand
that you are engaging in a tradition

08:48.819 --> 08:50.780
that goes back thousands of years.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.909
You are accepting
the yoke of responsibility

08:54.909 --> 08:57.286
for your family and your community,

08:57.286 --> 08:59.372
and all the commandments of the <i>Torah.</i>

09:00.039 --> 09:01.791
And you're taking it upon yourself

09:01.791 --> 09:05.211
that it is your turn
to try and fix this world.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.548
The world is upside down right now,

09:08.548 --> 09:12.510
and we need all the smart,
thinking girls to help fix it.

09:13.636 --> 09:14.929
Right. Okay.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.514
And you're gonna carry this torch

09:16.514 --> 09:20.268
for all of the Fleishmans
and all of the Jewish people.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.104
Right.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.190
Well, then I think we're set.

09:26.691 --> 09:27.900
I think I'm not gonna do this.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.028
Hmm?

09:31.237 --> 09:32.446
Hannah?

09:33.197 --> 09:34.532
I don't think I should do this.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.658
Hannah.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.952
- I'm just...
- Well, let's just take a minute.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.287
- Yeah.
- I'm just not doing it.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.871
The bat mitzvah. Can we go?

09:40.871 --> 09:42.790
Hannah... She did this study.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.418
She did all the studying. I'm sorry.
I don't know what this is. Hannah?

09:45.418 --> 09:46.544
I'm gonna go.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.629
Thank you, Rabbi.
And I'm sorry it didn't work out.

09:50.464 --> 09:53.009
I'm so... This came
as a complete surprise to me.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.177
I know your family
has been going through a lot.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.804
Yeah. Let me go speak with her.
Is that...

09:56.804 --> 09:58.431
- Yeah.
- Okay. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.765
- Solly, come on.
- Take your time.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.314
Hannah, hey, what's going on?

10:07.898 --> 10:09.734
I wanted to see what it would be like
up here.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.486
You'll have another chance in November.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.905
Dad, I'm not doing it. For real.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.783
Is this about what happened at camp?

10:17.783 --> 10:20.703
Because I can promise you
that by the time November rolls around,

10:20.703 --> 10:22.538
like, no one will remember it.

10:23.372 --> 10:24.415
It's not.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.751
Is it about your mother?

10:26.751 --> 10:27.835
It's not that.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.631
Listen, I know it's been hard
with her gone,

10:31.631 --> 10:35.217
but we're still Jews,
and this is what we do.

10:35.217 --> 10:38.137
But why? Why do we do it? I...

10:39.472 --> 10:41.098
I don't even know if I believe in God.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.100
Yeah, well, that's actually
not what this is about.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.935
This is about becoming an adult
in your community.

10:44.935 --> 10:47.063
This is about taking on
my traditions as yours,

10:47.063 --> 10:48.856
you can pass them along to your family.

10:49.398 --> 10:52.026
I guess I just don't understand
why I would do it.

10:55.237 --> 10:59.325
We do it because that's what we do.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.411
We're the Fleishmans and we're Jews.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.497
It doesn't seem smart to me.

11:06.707 --> 11:07.875
What has it given us?

11:07.875 --> 11:09.960
How has it even helped the world?

11:11.921 --> 11:13.297
We're a mess, Dad.

11:13.297 --> 11:14.965
The Fleishmans are a mess.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.760
You're being too literal I think.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.470
- No, no, I'm not.
- No?

11:19.470 --> 11:21.097
You always tell me to think for myself

11:21.097 --> 11:23.182
and not to be corrupted
by the people around me,

11:23.182 --> 11:26.102
but I want my own traditions.

11:26.102 --> 11:29.647
I want my own life
and I wanna make my own decisions.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.233
I don't want to have to fix anything.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.026
I haven't even broken anything.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.153
I'm only 11.

11:40.825 --> 11:43.619
<i>I could tell you that Toby
looked at his daughter just then,</i>

11:43.619 --> 11:45.287
<i>his wise, beautiful daughter,</i>

11:45.287 --> 11:47.540
<i>who had been put through
too much recently,</i>

11:48.207 --> 11:49.792
<i>and realized that she was right.</i>

11:52.378 --> 11:54.588
You know, another great tradition
is forging your own path

11:54.588 --> 11:56.298
and being better than your parents.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.886
Here, come here.
Come here, my sweet girl.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.099
Now, you stand here.

12:05.641 --> 12:08.310
<i>And if a bat mitzvah
is also a coming of age,</i>

12:09.645 --> 12:13.357
<i>then he had to agree that Hannah
did not need a ceremony to do that.</i>

12:14.859 --> 12:16.360
<i>She'd grown up right in front of him,</i>

12:17.027 --> 12:19.488
<i>slowly and then all at once.</i>

12:29.248 --> 12:32.585
May God make you
like Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel and Leah.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.796
May God bless you and protect you.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.842
May God show you favor
and be gracious to you.

12:42.511 --> 12:46.056
May God, may God show you kindness,

12:48.517 --> 12:49.769
and grant you peace.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.299
<i>I could tell you that
after weeks of starts and stops,</i>

13:20.299 --> 13:22.718
<i>that was the moment
that the Fleishmans understood</i>

13:22.718 --> 13:26.889
<i>that a divorce was an earthquake
for two people who used to be in love.</i>

13:27.473 --> 13:29.475
<i>But it was a chronic condition
for the children</i>

13:29.475 --> 13:31.143
<i>who had to somehow survive it.</i>

14:19.984 --> 14:22.570
<i>I could tell you that the Fleishmans
found themselves again</i>

14:22.570 --> 14:23.946
<i>at the Vantablack exhibit,</i>

14:23.946 --> 14:25.573
<i>which was in its last days.</i>

14:28.909 --> 14:30.744
<i>They decided to go in and see it,</i>

14:30.744 --> 14:33.539
<i>to really finally
face the void together.</i>

14:34.373 --> 14:35.666
Ready?

15:01.650 --> 15:03.986
<i>But I could not tell you
what Toby did next.</i>

15:07.781 --> 15:09.325
<i>I had my own shit going on.</i>

15:22.254 --> 15:23.422
<i>What had happened to me was that</i>

15:23.422 --> 15:26.008
<i>at the beginning of the summer,
before Toby called me,</i>

15:26.008 --> 15:29.970
<i>I was heading into my second year
of being a stay-at-home mom</i>

15:29.970 --> 15:31.764
<i>and my thirteenth year of marriage</i>

15:31.764 --> 15:35.517
<i>and my fifth year in a suburb
and my forty-first year of life.</i>

15:36.310 --> 15:39.063
<i>But none of that changed
who I essentially was,</i>

15:39.063 --> 15:41.941
<i>which was a magazine writer
with no assignment.</i>

15:42.816 --> 15:45.945
<i>That didn't stop me from pontificating
all over the suburbs.</i>

15:46.195 --> 15:47.488
You know what I think?

15:47.488 --> 15:51.533
I think that the men of this generation,
they are all like really good feminists,

15:51.533 --> 15:55.371
but they haven't actually thought
about what it means to be equal.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.914
They're so fragile all the time.

15:56.914 --> 16:00.167
We just spend all of our time reassuring

16:00.501 --> 16:03.003
and fellating
every insecurity out of them.

16:03.003 --> 16:06.507
Do you ever think
that those Future Is Female shirts,

16:06.507 --> 16:09.009
they're like Free Beer Tomorrow?

16:09.009 --> 16:12.221
You know, it's the future
is always in the future.

16:12.846 --> 16:16.058
Do you really think that they would let
us wear those shirts if it were true?

16:18.519 --> 16:19.812
I think it's just a shirt, Lib.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.190
I gotta go make dinner.

16:23.941 --> 16:24.942
Yeah, me, too.

16:25.734 --> 16:26.735
I'm riding with you?

16:28.487 --> 16:32.199
<i>And then into that morass,
I bumped into Michelle.</i>

16:33.075 --> 16:35.077
Libby! Hi!

16:35.494 --> 16:36.578
Michelle?

16:36.578 --> 16:38.247
Oh, my God, look at you.

16:38.914 --> 16:39.957
You look amazing.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.959
Yeah, well, I'm getting a divorce.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.753
- What?
- Yeah.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.506
Oh, my God, that's crazy. What happened?

16:47.506 --> 16:50.259
It's a long story, but it's good.

16:50.759 --> 16:54.263
I'm actually seeing someone,
my boyfriend from college.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.764
What?

16:55.764 --> 16:58.892
We reconnected on Facebook.
I know, what a cliché, right?

16:58.892 --> 17:01.395
I'm going to move to the city.
Jonathan will stay here

17:01.395 --> 17:03.230
and we'll take turns
staying with the kids.

17:04.189 --> 17:07.901
I'm just so, I'm so surprised,
you guys, you always seemed so happy.

17:08.485 --> 17:10.904
We were just very good friends,
you know?

17:11.530 --> 17:13.699
Yeah. Yeah.

17:14.533 --> 17:17.411
God. Okay, I'm sorry. I wanna
understand, like, all of this.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.038
Please start from the beginning.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.499
So we had just come back
from this amazing vacation...

17:22.499 --> 17:25.127
<i>It was the third divorce
I'd heard about in a month.</i>

17:25.753 --> 17:28.756
<i>I started thinking
about divorce all the time.</i>

17:28.756 --> 17:32.509
<i>Not divorce,
but clean slates and new starts.</i>

17:32.509 --> 17:33.927
I feel like I'm me again.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.472
We're gonna get a place
on the Upper West Side...

17:36.764 --> 17:37.890
<i>"Me again."</i>

18:14.718 --> 18:16.303
<i>I had somehow fallen for it.</i>

18:16.303 --> 18:19.431
<i>Some dream of safety
that I hadn't understood</i>

18:19.431 --> 18:23.936
<i>would never reconcile with who I was,
which was a free and independent person.</i>

18:25.104 --> 18:27.606
<i>I'd taken all my freedom
and independence</i>

18:27.606 --> 18:30.234
<i>and pushed them across the poker table
and said,</i>

18:30.234 --> 18:33.237
<i>"Here, take my jackpot. Take it all.</i>

18:33.362 --> 18:36.657
<i>"I don't need it anymore.
I won't miss it ever."</i>

18:48.210 --> 18:50.295
<i>God, how hot I used to be for life.</i>

19:06.520 --> 19:09.398
<i>Larry Feldman
was the first guy I ever kissed.</i>

19:13.902 --> 19:16.572
<i>He was the first guy I ever...
A lot of things.</i>

20:09.166 --> 20:10.167
Oh, my God.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.086
<i>Libby Slater? Wow.</i>

20:20.510 --> 20:21.929
<i>How much I used to feel.</i>

20:22.596 --> 20:24.681
<i>How much I didn't feel any more.</i>

20:27.184 --> 20:28.560
<i>Larry Feldman!</i>

20:29.853 --> 20:31.980
<i>What is going on with you?</i>

20:36.485 --> 20:37.778
<i>I just remembered you</i>

20:37.778 --> 20:40.781
<i>and realized
that I didn't know what became of you.</i>

20:46.286 --> 20:48.372
<i>You know,
I remember you very often.</i>

20:50.082 --> 20:51.708
<i>Oh, yeah? That's funny.</i>

20:51.708 --> 20:54.044
<i>I just saw that you're friends
with everyone from school,</i>

20:54.044 --> 20:57.005
<i>and I don't know how
I missed being a part of that.</i>

21:00.342 --> 21:03.220
<i>I remember when you and I
were in that basement</i>

21:03.220 --> 21:05.889
<i>at Melissa Cooperman's
bat mitzvah after-party,</i>

21:05.889 --> 21:07.975
<i>and I think about
when you let me put my...</i>

21:12.562 --> 21:14.022
Oh, God. Gross.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.071
<i>Later that night,</i>

21:21.071 --> 21:24.700
<i>I heard from a friend
I hadn't spoken to in a dozen years.</i>

21:29.079 --> 21:32.249
- Toby Fleishman?
<i>- Elizabeth Slater.</i>

21:33.750 --> 21:37.421
Epstein. It's Epstein now.
Yeah, but yes. Hello.

21:38.213 --> 21:40.799
<i>It was so nice to be back with people</i>

21:40.799 --> 21:43.427
<i>that I never had to explain
who I was to.</i>

21:43.885 --> 21:46.722
<i>I'd been trying to return
to the most authentic version of myself,</i>

21:47.222 --> 21:50.350
<i>but it wasn't that dipshit
porn-dog Larry Feldman</i>

21:50.350 --> 21:52.602
<i>who knew me when I was most myself.</i>

21:52.602 --> 21:53.812
<i>It was Toby.</i>

21:54.604 --> 21:56.773
<i>I began to feel less unmoored.</i>

21:57.357 --> 22:01.820
<i>But I was living this life
that wasn't mine anymore.</i>

22:03.905 --> 22:06.783
<i>And then I was living a life
that hadn't ever been mine.</i>

22:07.701 --> 22:10.912
Toby Fleishman! Hot damn!

22:19.212 --> 22:21.923
<i>I did finally go home that night</i>

22:21.923 --> 22:24.468
<i>after I went to Toby's house
to tell him about Rachel.</i>

22:27.012 --> 22:30.182
<i>After I hadn't been in contact
with my own family for days.</i>

23:06.009 --> 23:07.010
Hi.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.056
I'm sorry.

23:27.489 --> 23:30.325
- Mom, you're making breakfast?
- Hi.

23:30.325 --> 23:33.745
I have been helping a friend
with something,

23:33.745 --> 23:34.996
but I'm back.

23:35.789 --> 23:36.873
I made pancakes.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.043
- I want to hear everything.
- I don't eat breakfast anymore.

23:42.045 --> 23:43.046
What does that mean?

23:43.046 --> 23:44.548
That's why
we get you lessons, bud.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.882
I'm never going to pass.

23:45.882 --> 23:47.092
I'm not going.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.845
- What's going on?
- I'm not taking the swimming test.

23:49.845 --> 23:52.431
Miles, you can't learn this stuff
unless you learn this stuff.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.724
What's the problem?
You have to take the swimming test.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.685
- I got this.
- I'm not going.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.812
I'm not taking any more lessons.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.189
- Okay, Miles, I know you don't--
- I got this.

24:01.189 --> 24:03.400
- It kind of seems like you're--
- We're gonna be late.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.320
- I made breakfast for everybody.
- We get breakfast on the way now.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.239
I already called in an order
at the bagel place.

24:09.239 --> 24:12.617
I've got court today. Come on,
we're late. We're late. Let's go.

24:13.827 --> 24:14.828
Bye.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.759
<i>It went on like that for a while.</i>

24:30.385 --> 24:31.803
<i>Me doing penance.</i>

24:32.721 --> 24:37.684
<i>Me staring out into the Vantablack,
wondering how this would get resolved.</i>

24:44.983 --> 24:46.693
<i>I wasn't speaking to Toby anymore.</i>

24:47.569 --> 24:49.446
<i>Seth wasn't speaking to either of us.</i>

24:50.113 --> 24:52.199
<i>And I've tried to wedge myself
back into my life</i>

24:52.199 --> 24:54.284
<i>before anyone noticed I'd been gone.</i>

24:56.495 --> 24:58.788
<i>Fifty of the nation's most senior</i>

24:58.788 --> 25:00.957
<i>Republican national security officials</i>

25:00.957 --> 25:03.502
<i>have published a letter
declaring that Donald...</i>

25:08.548 --> 25:10.550
Sasha, what are you doing?

25:10.550 --> 25:11.676
Hi, Mom.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.220
Well, is this a party?

25:14.221 --> 25:16.598
No, it's a barbecue.
Dad's in the back.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.142
- Dad's in the back?
- Yeah.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.734
I need ten kids,
but so far I have three.

25:28.777 --> 25:29.861
So fun.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.196
Maybe Libby will do it.

25:31.696 --> 25:34.241
Well, look who came out of the woodwork.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.408
- Libby.
- Hi.

25:35.408 --> 25:38.286
I thought you couldn't make it.
Adam said you couldn't make it.

25:39.204 --> 25:42.749
Oh. Uh, I think
we just got our signals crossed.

25:42.749 --> 25:44.459
- Here.
- Thank you.

25:44.459 --> 25:48.129
I was thinking of doing that one week
drama camp for the girls before school.

25:48.129 --> 25:50.090
Do you think Sasha would want to?

25:52.634 --> 25:55.762
I don't actually know if she's still
into doing drama, I have to ask her.

25:57.681 --> 25:58.765
I'll ask Adam.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.689
Sorry, can you just... Can I...

26:05.689 --> 26:07.649
I'll be right back. One second.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.735
...military. It's so dark
that it's dangerous.

26:10.735 --> 26:13.446
You know, people,
they see and they freak out.

26:13.446 --> 26:14.906
"They freak out," run screaming?

26:14.906 --> 26:17.200
Yes. No, I'm telling you. It's...

26:17.200 --> 26:20.287
They have to leave
because they, like, lose their footing.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.496
- Oh, hey, Libby. Hi.
- Hey.

26:22.163 --> 26:23.164
Hi.

26:23.623 --> 26:24.624
Did we talk about this?

26:25.584 --> 26:27.377
- About this barbecue?
- Yeah.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.337
I don't know.
It was in the family calendar.

26:29.921 --> 26:33.049
Sure, but I mean this morning,
when we were talking,

26:33.049 --> 26:34.301
did we talk about this?

26:34.301 --> 26:37.053
I don't know, Libby.
I can't keep track of you.

26:37.053 --> 26:40.682
Okay. I've been home. That's not fair.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.602
Adam, you're coming over later
for the game?

26:43.602 --> 26:44.936
You know it.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.187
You better bring that <i>queso.</i>

26:47.606 --> 26:48.607
What game?

26:48.898 --> 26:49.899
Really?

26:49.899 --> 26:51.860
People watch the game now?

26:53.028 --> 26:54.321
You eat <i>queso?</i>

26:55.196 --> 26:57.824
He makes the best <i>queso</i> I've ever had.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.827
- You make <i>queso?</i>
- Yeah.

27:01.703 --> 27:02.787
I make <i>queso.</i>

27:06.625 --> 27:07.667
Excuse me.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.087
Can I talk to you for a second?

27:11.087 --> 27:13.131
Yeah. Now's... Now's not good.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.383
"Now's not good." Wow. Okay.

27:15.383 --> 27:16.885
- We're at a fucking barbecue.
- Oh, my God.

27:16.885 --> 27:19.387
Can you please just stop being
so fucking passive about everything.

27:19.387 --> 27:22.223
Please. Please, please. I just wanna
have, like, a regular conversation.

27:22.223 --> 27:25.894
You are incapable of having
just a regular conversation, please.

27:37.864 --> 27:39.282
Okay. I know.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.494
I'm terrible. Okay?

27:43.203 --> 27:44.204
I'm sorry.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.915
So just please talk to me.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.584
About what?
There's nothing to talk about.

27:52.879 --> 27:54.089
You do whatever you want.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.801
And I could not be a more thoughtful,
considerate husband to you.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.637
You are merciless lately.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.807
Miserable all the time, sarcastic.

28:03.807 --> 28:06.142
What do you think it means to me,
to the kids,

28:06.142 --> 28:08.269
that you walk around so unhappy?

28:08.269 --> 28:11.022
I have no idea
what's happened to you lately.

28:11.981 --> 28:14.192
God, I didn't want to get into this.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.736
Okay, look. You're right.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.531
I have been terrible.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.699
You are wonderful.

28:22.575 --> 28:24.202
I don't know what's wrong with me.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.578
I keep trying to figure it out.

28:27.789 --> 28:28.998
I feel like I'm...

28:30.792 --> 28:32.752
Like, I'm not alive anymore.

28:32.752 --> 28:33.837
Well, you know what?

28:34.671 --> 28:37.340
I'm happy, okay? We have friends.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.759
- We have--
- Okay. These are not friends, though.

28:39.759 --> 28:42.429
Like, they're not.
I can't talk to any of these people.

28:42.429 --> 28:44.848
They treat me like I'm a fucking oddity.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.517
They just talk about their kids
and their houses all the time.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.894
We have two wonderful children.

28:49.894 --> 28:52.897
We have income and safety and health

28:52.897 --> 28:55.316
and the enormous privileges
of our class.

28:55.316 --> 28:59.487
We are the kinds of people
who are invited to barbecues.

28:59.487 --> 29:02.449
And if you gave these people a chance,
you would find they are filled

29:02.449 --> 29:04.701
with the same kind of ambivalence
that you have.

29:04.701 --> 29:06.911
They're not.
I promise you, they are not.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.038
No. They are. They are, okay?

29:09.956 --> 29:11.875
They are all trying to figure it out.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.626
- Just like you. Just like me...
- It's not true!

29:13.626 --> 29:16.129
- If you wanted to know.
- It's not true though, Adam.

29:16.129 --> 29:19.549
They love it here. All they talk about
is how wonderful it is all the time.

29:19.549 --> 29:22.302
It's like we've died
and these houses are our headstones.

29:22.302 --> 29:23.970
We chose this.

29:23.970 --> 29:27.390
Libby, you chose it, marriage, children.

29:27.390 --> 29:30.101
Every single bit of it, we chose it.

29:30.727 --> 29:33.438
I know, I know. I know.
I don't know, though,

29:33.438 --> 29:38.151
because, honestly, I feel like
a few years ago I was a person, right?

29:38.151 --> 29:39.486
And then I looked up,

29:39.486 --> 29:41.279
and I just, I have no idea

29:41.279 --> 29:44.073
when everything started to feel...
so the same.

29:44.073 --> 29:45.867
Don't talk to me about your burdens.

29:45.867 --> 29:48.286
The kids are always
with the babysitter lately,

29:48.286 --> 29:50.413
and you barely even look at me anymore.

29:50.413 --> 29:53.082
Okay. I am trying
to figure it out, though. I really am.

29:53.082 --> 29:57.003
You could bother looking at me
while you try to figure it out, right?

29:57.003 --> 29:59.339
I could be a part
of your figuring it out.

29:59.339 --> 30:03.718
This is about you, all of a sudden?
It's so not about you, Adam.

30:05.553 --> 30:06.805
Are you sleeping with Toby?

30:07.472 --> 30:08.473
Am I what?

30:08.473 --> 30:10.099
You slept over
at his fucking house, Libby.

30:10.099 --> 30:13.061
No, of course I'm not sleeping
with Toby. Are you crazy?

30:13.061 --> 30:16.022
- That's all you have to say?
- I don't even know why I did that, okay?

30:16.022 --> 30:17.649
I just... You expect me
to know everything.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.609
To have all of the answers.
I don't have the answers.

30:19.609 --> 30:22.320
- I don't have them.
- No, I expect you to come home at night.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.988
Is that so crazy?

30:28.785 --> 30:29.828
I have to go.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.497
- Sorry, you have to go?
- Yes.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.874
I was asked to peel the corn
at this barbecue,

30:34.874 --> 30:38.294
which you knew about
and which was in the family calendar.

30:38.294 --> 30:42.173
And when I say I'm gonna be somewhere
and do something, I do it.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.951
Yeah, so I converted the garage
into a bar.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.120
The best move I ever made.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.830
Yeah,
you can't do that in Brooklyn.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.832
Did you get a French drain?

31:15.832 --> 31:19.210
You know, actually, we just pitched the
soil, so there's no flooding anymore.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.504
Well, your house is on top of that hill,
that makes sense.

31:21.504 --> 31:23.882
The guy looks at me
with a totally straight face,

31:23.882 --> 31:26.718
and he says, "You seem nice,
but you're not my type."

32:12.055 --> 32:15.141
Get in the shower, and then...
Hurry up.

33:10.613 --> 33:11.906
You just staying in bed today?

33:14.951 --> 33:17.328
My alarm, I forgot to set it.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.872
I just had the craziest dream.

33:19.872 --> 33:21.708
I guess I'm taking the kids to camp.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.752
Kids, kids, come on, we're late.
Let's go.

33:24.752 --> 33:26.087
Okay.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.922
- We're always late.
- Let's go!

33:34.554 --> 33:36.222
Glenn? Hi.

33:36.222 --> 33:38.141
<i>Hey, I thought you'd want to know...</i>

33:39.142 --> 33:40.143
<i>Archer died.</i>

33:43.896 --> 33:45.231
Wait. What?

33:46.190 --> 33:48.317
No, that's, that's so crazy.

33:48.317 --> 33:51.070
I, like, literally
just had a dream about him.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.155
What happened?

34:00.580 --> 34:03.541
<i>In my dream, I had been
asking Archer for advice.</i>

34:03.541 --> 34:04.876
<i>I can't remember on what,</i>

34:04.876 --> 34:07.712
<i>but he kept asking
if we'd ever slept together.</i>

34:09.589 --> 34:14.135
<i>Like, in life, I kept reminding him
who I was and how much I admired him.</i>

34:15.636 --> 34:17.930
<i>And his response to that was,</i>

34:18.848 --> 34:20.308
<i>"What does that have to do with me?"</i>

34:42.038 --> 34:44.082
Goodbye. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

34:55.301 --> 34:59.138
<i>Hey, can we pretend we talked this
all through and just move on?</i>

34:59.138 --> 35:00.723
<i>I'm having a party on Saturday.</i>

35:00.723 --> 35:02.558
<i>It's really important to me
that you come.</i>

35:02.558 --> 35:03.976
<i>Dress nicely, please.</i>

35:06.813 --> 35:08.356
The three of us
are having a slumber party,

35:08.356 --> 35:11.609
but we're gonna tell Sophie
that she has to start using deodorant.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.444
The situation has gotten out of control.

35:13.444 --> 35:14.612
Puberty, man.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.115
I'm gonna call Susannah,

35:17.115 --> 35:19.367
see if she can watch them
on Saturday night.

35:19.367 --> 35:20.618
Why? I'll be home.

35:21.285 --> 35:22.662
No, uh, Seth,

35:23.579 --> 35:27.041
he's asked us to a party.
He's having a party.

35:32.839 --> 35:33.923
But I can't not go.

35:35.883 --> 35:39.679
He specifically said that it was
important to him that I be there so...

35:46.310 --> 35:47.353
I hope you have a good time.

36:43.117 --> 36:46.078
I'll have a negroni, please. Thanks.

36:51.667 --> 36:54.462
You know what's going on here, right?

36:58.716 --> 37:00.301
- God damn it.
- Yeah.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.596
- I never thought I would see this day.
- I know.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.181
That... What a fucking idiot!

37:05.181 --> 37:06.599
What a stupid dipshit.

37:08.726 --> 37:10.394
Oh, God.

37:10.394 --> 37:12.188
Could I have everyone's attention?

37:12.688 --> 37:14.190
- Just for a moment. Thank you.
- Thanks.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.900
Thank you for coming. Thank you.

37:15.900 --> 37:20.238
Uh, I just wanted to say that I've had
a lot of parties throughout the years,

37:20.238 --> 37:23.157
and I used to have theme parties

37:24.325 --> 37:26.118
that I would call learning parties,

37:26.118 --> 37:29.038
and we would dress up
as historical figures

37:29.038 --> 37:32.833
or have somebody come
and give a math lecture.

37:33.709 --> 37:35.419
Really, they're just excuses
to get drunk.

37:35.419 --> 37:39.465
But I was always trying
to make sense of the world,

37:39.465 --> 37:41.884
understand it and make peace with it.

37:42.677 --> 37:45.554
And I thought if I could just do that,

37:46.180 --> 37:48.140
then I could start to live my life.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.142
Uh...

37:50.559 --> 37:54.313
Today, I am here to tell you I give up.

37:54.981 --> 37:56.649
I will never understand it.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.736
And so I should do...

38:02.655 --> 38:05.366
what every part of my body
is telling me to do.

38:07.368 --> 38:11.330
And that is to ask the prettiest girl
in this room if she would marry me.

38:15.835 --> 38:18.212
It's all a lot simpler
than I ever thought it would be. I...

38:19.755 --> 38:21.882
I just want to wake up every day
and see her face.

38:30.516 --> 38:32.768
What do you say,
Vanessa Lipschitz-Finklestein?

38:33.936 --> 38:36.731
Can I make you
Vanessa Lipschitz-Finklestein-Morris?

38:38.941 --> 38:41.027
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.251
I told her we were here
for my mother's birthday.

39:03.466 --> 39:04.633
Are you crying?

39:07.887 --> 39:08.888
I just... How could he...

39:09.847 --> 39:12.350
Ugh, how could he possibly think
that this is a good idea

39:12.350 --> 39:14.602
after spending the entire summer
listening to us?

39:14.602 --> 39:16.729
I know. I mean, I guess in Seth's story,

39:16.729 --> 39:19.815
we're just the co-stars
who help him make this big decision.

39:23.819 --> 39:24.820
Sorry, Lib.

39:29.492 --> 39:32.411
I am, too. I really...

39:34.163 --> 39:37.917
You know, it doesn't even matter.
I'm... I'm sorry, too.

39:44.298 --> 39:45.383
Well, that's it.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.886
Our boy is finally a man.

39:57.686 --> 39:58.687
<i>What can I say?</i>

39:58.687 --> 40:01.107
<i>Life is a process
in which you collect people</i>

40:01.107 --> 40:03.692
<i>and prune them
when they stop working for you.</i>

40:03.692 --> 40:06.737
<i>The only exceptions
are the friends you make in college.</i>

40:08.489 --> 40:09.907
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.450
Congratulations.

40:12.368 --> 40:14.203
I'm really happy for you.

40:14.829 --> 40:15.830
I'm so glad you came.

40:16.997 --> 40:18.958
I'm sorry that we fought, Seth.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.960
I take you very seriously.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.503
You are a real person.

40:22.503 --> 40:25.172
Yes, you are extremely real.
I feel like I could touch you.

40:25.172 --> 40:27.049
I bet you have a social security number.

40:27.049 --> 40:29.301
Now, don't actually...
Don't actually... Don't actually.

40:31.971 --> 40:33.806
Do you think
I'm an idiot for doing this?

40:36.934 --> 40:37.935
No.

40:38.602 --> 40:43.065
No, I think maybe marriage is like
that quote about democracy, you know,

40:43.065 --> 40:44.900
"It's the worst form of government
in the world,

40:44.900 --> 40:46.235
"except for all the other forms."

40:47.111 --> 40:48.612
- You know?
- Nice.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.114
Listen, we love you.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.074
We're here for you. It's gonna be great.

40:52.783 --> 40:54.827
Well, that's a rare nice thing
you just said to me.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.370
- Thank you.
- Yeah, no, I'm happy for you.

40:57.204 --> 40:59.206
- We're both very happy for you.
- Yes.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.253
May your... May your

41:05.045 --> 41:08.799
most virile sperm

41:09.800 --> 41:13.888
make their odyssey through
her fallopian tubes

41:13.888 --> 41:18.809
and conquer her ovaries,
bringing you sons.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.728
- Sons...
- Sons!

41:20.728 --> 41:21.937
By conquering the ovaries.

41:21.937 --> 41:23.189
Did you even take freshman bio?

41:23.189 --> 41:24.648
- Why is that not how it...
- No.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.317
- Is that not how it works?
- May your sons

41:26.317 --> 41:28.402
marry the daughters of finance bros,

41:28.402 --> 41:32.072
and with ever-greater dowries
and stock options,

41:32.072 --> 41:33.282
in Tesla and Apple.

41:33.949 --> 41:36.744
You know, everything the beggar woman
said came true.

41:36.744 --> 41:39.371
She said, "You were never gonna
be happy with what you were given.

41:39.371 --> 41:41.624
"You're gonna always
want something different."

41:42.708 --> 41:44.460
She said you were gonna heal the world.

41:45.586 --> 41:47.546
Yeah, but that was only
when I had money to give her.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.135
We're all good, right?

41:54.595 --> 41:57.640
It feels like something is ending.
I can't take an ending right now.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.183
No, it's not. It's not. We're all good.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.685
- Yeah, we're good.
- Seth?

42:05.105 --> 42:06.106
Gotta go.

42:06.815 --> 42:08.567
My fiancée is calling me!

42:11.111 --> 42:12.154
Hi.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.243
I heard Archer Sylvan died.

42:17.243 --> 42:19.036
Yeah. Yeah.

42:19.912 --> 42:21.372
He died as he lived.

42:22.081 --> 42:24.917
Practicing autoerotic asphyxiation

42:24.917 --> 42:27.127
- in a hotel in Thailand...
- Oh, boy.

42:27.127 --> 42:29.046
...surrounded by prostitutes.

42:29.046 --> 42:30.923
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

42:31.090 --> 42:34.552
It was very, very weird, though.
Like, I had this dream about him.

42:35.177 --> 42:38.472
And my editor calls me
and he told me that he died.

42:39.557 --> 42:40.891
- That's crazy.
- Yeah.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.269
It took them, like, a week
to find the body.

42:43.269 --> 42:45.396
- That's terrible. What? The smell?
- No, no, no.

42:45.396 --> 42:49.358
He was on a story and he was late,
you know, or later than usual, so...

42:50.859 --> 42:53.279
The magazine's paying
for the funeral and everything

42:53.279 --> 42:55.739
because he didn't have anybody.

42:55.739 --> 42:57.199
- That's so sad.
- Yeah.

42:57.199 --> 42:58.909
We're lucky we have people.

42:59.702 --> 43:01.954
You're lucky. You know that, right?

43:02.997 --> 43:04.331
- I think so. Yeah.
- Okay.

43:04.331 --> 43:05.457
I just...

43:06.667 --> 43:09.211
I'm just lost. I don't know.

43:09.211 --> 43:10.921
I don't know
what I'm doing with my life.

43:10.921 --> 43:13.299
What do you mean, what you're doing
with your life? It's done.

43:13.299 --> 43:15.593
You're loved, Elizabeth.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.304
Please, please tell me you understand
how special that is, right?

43:18.304 --> 43:19.388
Yes, I just don't...

43:21.098 --> 43:22.641
I guess it's just not enough for me.

43:22.766 --> 43:24.351
Oh, God. Okay, I know.

43:25.019 --> 43:28.647
Honestly? It might not
be enough for you either, so.

43:28.647 --> 43:30.899
No, no, it would be.
It definitely would be.

43:30.899 --> 43:33.152
I know that you fantasize
that it would be

43:33.152 --> 43:35.738
because you have had
such a struggle all these years.

43:35.738 --> 43:38.157
But you really have no idea
how you would feel

43:38.157 --> 43:40.034
if you got the thing that you wanted.

43:40.826 --> 43:41.869
You don't.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.788
And contentment breeds quiet,

43:45.581 --> 43:48.626
which breeds complacency,
which breeds unrest.

43:50.628 --> 43:51.879
Maybe you should go back to work.

43:54.006 --> 43:55.215
Yeah, I think I might.

43:56.508 --> 43:57.885
I think I might write a book.

43:58.469 --> 44:01.555
- A book? That's good. About what?
- Hmm.

44:02.473 --> 44:03.557
About life,

44:04.308 --> 44:06.685
and marriage

44:06.685 --> 44:10.230
and money and dissatisfaction

44:10.230 --> 44:12.358
and lifelong friendship.

44:12.358 --> 44:15.527
And like, how all these things coalesce
in middle age, right?

44:15.527 --> 44:19.406
And make you miserable
right at the exact point

44:19.406 --> 44:21.700
that you're supposed
to have everything set.

44:21.700 --> 44:23.243
- Okay.
- Yeah.

44:24.578 --> 44:25.996
Yeah, it'll be about everything.

44:25.996 --> 44:28.582
- Everything?
- Everything.

44:28.582 --> 44:30.501
Hmm. That's heavy.

44:31.085 --> 44:34.797
Maybe, or maybe what's the point
of writing about anything,

44:34.797 --> 44:37.216
- if it's not gonna be about everything?
- Yeah.

44:37.216 --> 44:38.842
That's what Archer did.

44:38.842 --> 44:40.344
That's good. No, you should,

44:40.344 --> 44:42.680
- you should go be like Archer.
- Yeah.

44:43.972 --> 44:45.307
Maybe I'll be better than Archer.

44:46.308 --> 44:47.976
You know, I'll tell a really good story,

44:47.976 --> 44:50.437
but I'll tell
all the other sides of it, too,

44:50.437 --> 44:52.189
not just the ones that I like.

44:52.940 --> 44:54.983
All right. So what,
what happens in the book?

44:57.027 --> 45:01.824
Well, um, a newly divorced man
wakes up one morning,

45:02.991 --> 45:06.161
to find that his ex
has dropped off the kids

45:06.161 --> 45:09.623
- and does not appear to be coming back.
- Okay.

45:09.623 --> 45:12.334
And so then he's left
to figure out where she is

45:12.334 --> 45:16.171
and why life seems to have
gone so wrong for him.

45:18.382 --> 45:19.591
- I hate this story.
- Yeah.

45:19.591 --> 45:22.970
No, but sorry, how are you gonna write
it though? I mean, it has no ending.

45:22.970 --> 45:24.388
- There's no ending yet.
- I don't know.

45:24.388 --> 45:26.807
This, maybe this, this is the ending.

45:26.807 --> 45:28.726
This. Okay. Well, imagine that.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.519
No, don't end it here.
This is not a good ending.

45:30.519 --> 45:31.895
Engagements are not good endings.

45:31.895 --> 45:33.814
Weddings are worse,
but engagements are bad.

45:33.814 --> 45:37.359
Okay, then maybe,
maybe it ends with her returning.

45:38.235 --> 45:40.863
You know, like the whole thing
was just this terrible blip.

45:40.863 --> 45:41.989
So she just comes back?

45:43.198 --> 45:44.199
Maybe.

45:45.200 --> 45:47.244
Why? Why does she come back?

45:47.953 --> 45:50.664
She comes back
because she was always gonna come back.

45:52.916 --> 45:54.668
For a while, she wasn't sure,

45:54.668 --> 45:56.420
because being sure would have made

45:56.420 --> 45:58.547
the whole thing feel,
you know, less dangerous.

45:58.547 --> 46:01.216
It is possible that, like, a person
needs a little bit of danger

46:02.134 --> 46:04.136
in order to feel like
she knows what matters.

46:06.513 --> 46:07.806
That doesn't sound like Rachel.

46:07.806 --> 46:10.934
She's aware she behaved terribly.
But it's like she's...

46:11.852 --> 46:13.937
It's like, she was outside her body,
you know,

46:13.937 --> 46:16.690
like watching herself the whole time.

46:16.690 --> 46:19.526
And the problem
wasn't even her marriage.

46:20.444 --> 46:23.614
It was just like her marriage
was a witness

46:23.614 --> 46:26.408
to all of her other failures,

46:26.408 --> 46:31.455
like a comorbidity
to how she was just getting old.

46:31.455 --> 46:32.539
Hmm.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.797
And so then, in the end,
when she comes home...

46:41.590 --> 46:44.635
she realizes that she really,
really needs to figure out her life.

46:47.513 --> 46:49.139
Because, yeah,
her marriage is not perfect.

46:49.139 --> 46:50.224
But like...

46:52.768 --> 46:55.896
It's not like not being married
is ever gonna make her young again.

46:57.815 --> 47:00.192
And nothing could make her
unmake the choices

47:01.276 --> 47:02.277
that she made.

47:02.277 --> 47:04.279
She just didn't know
when she was making the choices,

47:04.279 --> 47:06.198
that they were gonna limit
all the other choices

47:06.198 --> 47:07.950
that she could make in the future.

47:10.494 --> 47:12.120
It's not even her decisions...

47:16.083 --> 47:20.420
It's just how can you live
when you used to have unlimited choices,

47:21.922 --> 47:23.632
and you don't have them anymore?

47:27.219 --> 47:28.220
I'm sorry.

47:28.887 --> 47:31.098
No, no, no, no, no. Please continue.

47:31.098 --> 47:32.599
So... Sorry. What happens?

47:32.599 --> 47:36.895
She comes back, she comes back
and it turns out it was just a mistake?

47:37.521 --> 47:39.731
Like, it was just, like,
a misunderstanding or something?

47:39.731 --> 47:43.193
Yeah, maybe she's just like,
she just, she...

47:43.193 --> 47:45.696
- She just appears.
- Just appears.

47:45.696 --> 47:46.822
Okay, and then what?

47:48.407 --> 47:50.117
It's raining. It's raining.

47:50.117 --> 47:53.829
It's a rain that breaks
this terrible heat wave.

47:53.829 --> 47:54.997
Mmm-hmm.

47:55.289 --> 47:56.748
And you're at home in your apartment

47:56.748 --> 47:58.458
and you're thinking about your life,

47:58.458 --> 48:00.669
and you're thinking
about moving on, right?

48:02.880 --> 48:05.716
- But then you hear the key in the lock.
- Okay.

48:06.341 --> 48:08.635
- And the creak of the hinge.
- That's nice.

48:09.928 --> 48:11.555
And you'll turn around and, suddenly,

48:11.555 --> 48:16.310
she's just there in the doorway.

48:17.227 --> 48:18.228
And then?

48:21.023 --> 48:22.774
And then the book ends.

48:25.694 --> 48:27.946
Yeah, but I mean
what happens after that?

48:32.701 --> 48:36.955
I don't know. I really don't think
I have the imagination for that.

48:37.831 --> 48:38.832
That's okay.

48:42.502 --> 48:44.796
God, I love you so much.

48:44.796 --> 48:46.089
You know that, right?

48:50.302 --> 48:52.220
I haven't been
a good friend to you lately.

48:55.098 --> 48:56.099
It's okay.

48:56.934 --> 48:58.226
You've been going through a lot.

48:59.478 --> 49:00.520
But I want you to know...

49:02.731 --> 49:04.149
you are still you.

49:06.526 --> 49:08.904
I can see it all.
I can see your darkness.

49:09.905 --> 49:11.657
And I can see your goodness.

49:12.366 --> 49:13.784
It is still there.

49:13.784 --> 49:17.120
Like the day we met, okay?

49:29.967 --> 49:33.178
- It's okay. Well done.
- Thank you.

49:37.683 --> 49:39.726
May God grant them happiness.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.526
May God grant them happiness.

49:55.283 --> 49:58.203
- You want to walk back uptown together?
- Sure.

49:58.203 --> 49:59.913
All right. I'm just gonna
run to the bathroom.

49:59.913 --> 50:01.248
Okay. I'll be outside.

51:16.907 --> 51:21.411
Hi, can you take me to New Jersey?
I'll pay double the meter.

51:21.912 --> 51:22.996
Sure.

51:23.497 --> 51:26.666
<i>Hey, sorry. I've found a cab,
so I'm gonna head home.</i>

52:04.913 --> 52:05.997
<i>We fall in love</i>

52:05.997 --> 52:09.918
<i>and we decide to marry
in this one incredible moment.</i>

52:12.796 --> 52:14.714
<i>What if everything
that happens after that</i>

52:14.714 --> 52:17.551
<i>is about trying to remember that moment?</i>

52:20.053 --> 52:23.890
- What? That did not...
- It's true. Are you listening?

52:23.890 --> 52:26.643
<i>Maybe that's what
all these divorces were about.</i>

52:28.812 --> 52:31.231
<i>We watch ourselves
and our spouses change,</i>

52:31.231 --> 52:33.900
<i>and the work is to constantly recall</i>

52:33.900 --> 52:36.403
<i>the reasons why you did this
in the first place.</i>

52:37.112 --> 52:40.157
<i>You mistake the person closest to you
for your misery.</i>

52:41.449 --> 52:45.829
<i>You think, "Maybe if I excised
this thing, I'd be me again."</i>

52:48.456 --> 52:50.333
<i>But you're not you anymore.</i>

52:53.128 --> 52:55.172
<i>You haven't been you in a long time.</i>

52:56.047 --> 52:57.048
<i>And it's not his fault.</i>

52:58.175 --> 52:59.426
<i>It was always going to happen.</i>

53:03.388 --> 53:05.056
<i>And what were you gonna do with the fact</i>

53:05.056 --> 53:07.726
<i>that time was gonna march on anyway?</i>

53:07.726 --> 53:10.770
<i>What were you gonna do with the fact
that you couldn't win this fight.</i>

53:12.147 --> 53:13.273
<i>That was the problem.</i>

53:13.940 --> 53:16.776
<i>You were not ever
going to be young again.</i>

53:17.819 --> 53:19.738
<i>You were only at risk
for not remembering</i>

53:19.738 --> 53:23.992
<i>that this was as good as it would get
in every single moment.</i>

53:24.367 --> 53:28.538
<i>That you are right now
as young as you will ever be again.</i>

53:30.165 --> 53:31.541
I can't tell anymore...

53:33.835 --> 53:34.836
<i>And now...</i>

53:37.547 --> 53:38.757
<i>And now...</i>

53:40.342 --> 53:41.676
<i>And now...</i>

53:43.136 --> 53:44.179
<i>And now...</i>

53:46.014 --> 53:47.015
<i>And now...</i>

53:49.267 --> 53:50.268
<i>And now...</i>

53:52.270 --> 53:53.271
<i>And now...</i>

53:54.689 --> 53:55.815
<i>And now...</i>

53:56.983 --> 53:57.984
<i>And now...</i>

53:59.069 --> 54:00.487
<i>And now...</i>

54:01.196 --> 54:02.197
<i>And now...</i>

54:03.448 --> 54:04.449
<i>And now...</i>

54:05.450 --> 54:06.576
<i>And now...</i>

54:07.702 --> 54:10.038
<i>And now...</i>

54:10.747 --> 54:11.748
<i>And now...</i>

54:12.999 --> 54:15.252
<i>And now, and now, and now, and now...</i>

54:15.252 --> 54:16.336
<i>And now...</i>

54:17.128 --> 54:18.255
<i>And now...</i>

54:24.094 --> 54:25.095
Oh, my God.

54:27.305 --> 54:28.932
It's so cold.

54:47.325 --> 54:48.326
<i>And now...</i>

56:42.440 --> 56:43.483
You're home?

56:45.944 --> 56:47.278
I ran home.

56:49.280 --> 56:52.283
Because I love you so much
I think I'm gonna die from it.

56:56.413 --> 56:57.914
I'm sorry I'm late.

57:02.919 --> 57:04.295
It's okay.

57:05.630 --> 57:07.090
You always come back.

57:58.516 --> 58:00.268
<i>Toby Fleishman
headed home that night</i>

58:00.268 --> 58:02.645
<i>and waited for the panic
to rise in him again.</i>

58:05.648 --> 58:09.944
<i>The same panic that washed him in sweats
every time he contemplated the future.</i>

58:13.531 --> 58:14.574
<i>But it didn't.</i>

58:16.409 --> 58:17.410
<i>He was healing.</i>

58:20.455 --> 58:21.539
- Hi.
- Hi.

58:21.539 --> 58:23.208
- Hi, how were they?
- They were fine.

58:23.208 --> 58:24.542
- Yeah?
- Solly won <i>Monopoly.</i>

58:24.542 --> 58:26.127
Oh, no, that bodes well.

58:26.961 --> 58:28.338
Thank you so much, Faith.

58:28.338 --> 58:29.422
- Thank you.
- Yeah, great.

58:29.422 --> 58:31.508
It's really pouring.
You have an umbrella or something?

58:31.508 --> 58:32.634
- I got one.
- Okay, great.

58:32.634 --> 58:34.427
- Thanks. Have a good night.
- Yeah, you too.

58:47.649 --> 58:50.068
<i>How could you
be so desperately unhappy</i>

58:50.068 --> 58:52.320
<i>when you were so essentially happy?</i>

58:54.030 --> 58:58.326
<i>How could you know so much
and still be this baffled by it all?</i>

59:02.413 --> 59:04.874
<i>The heat wave in Manhattan
was finally broken.</i>

59:05.708 --> 59:07.210
<i>Toby would survive this.</i>

59:07.835 --> 59:10.838
<i>In a hundred different ways,
he already had.</i>

59:12.090 --> 59:14.300
<i>He would start looking
for a new apartment tomorrow.</i>

59:14.968 --> 59:16.302
<i>One where everything worked.</i>

59:18.596 --> 59:21.057
<i>He looked out the window
and he saw his reflection,</i>

59:21.933 --> 59:23.560
<i>but then he also saw beyond himself.</i>

59:24.227 --> 59:26.229
<i>He saw the people
in the windows in the city</i>

59:26.771 --> 59:29.482
<i>all living their own
separate, distinct lives.</i>

59:30.858 --> 59:34.028
<i>"God," he thought,
"You could die of the loneliness.</i>

59:34.654 --> 59:36.739
<i>"But you could die of hope, too."</i>

59:37.490 --> 59:38.825
<i>The way it blinded you a little.</i>

59:39.826 --> 59:41.286
<i>The way it lead you to try again,</i>

59:42.036 --> 59:43.121
<i>despite what you knew.</i>

59:44.789 --> 59:45.957
<i>Time would move forward,</i>

59:46.708 --> 59:48.751
<i>but tonight, briefly,</i>

59:49.043 --> 59:52.505
<i>he had logged some optimism
into his block universe.</i>

59:53.756 --> 59:54.924
<i>It would stay there forever.</i>
