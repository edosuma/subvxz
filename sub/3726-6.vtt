00:01.060 --> 00:02.766
Previously on
"Pretty Little Liars.."

00:02.800 --> 00:04.392
Lesli?
What are you doing in Rosewood?

00:04.430 --> 00:05.727
You mention my name
to anyone ever again

00:05.770 --> 00:07.192
'and you'll live to regret it.‘

00:07.240 --> 00:09.231
(Aria)
We went to a junlqard
to take some pictures

00:09.270 --> 00:10.532
and I'm sure
A followed us there.

00:10.570 --> 00:12.299
Clark may have taken
a picture of A.

00:12.340 --> 00:14.376
- 'So borrow them.‘
- We're all good.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.568
(Sara)
'1 read the text you got.
From Aria.‘

00:18.610 --> 00:20.714
You've been looking
all along, haven't you?

00:20.750 --> 00:22.388
For whoever had us
down in that bunker.

00:22.420 --> 00:23.785
I've been trying to protect you.

00:23.820 --> 00:26.755
If a few bites of a cookie
can get me through my day

00:26.790 --> 00:27.779
and help me sleep..

00:27.820 --> 00:29.424
Doesn't work like that.

00:29.460 --> 00:30.722
(Hanna)
Why were you
stealing your file, Mona?

00:30.760 --> 00:32.125
She was stealing Lesli Stone's.

00:32.160 --> 00:33.388
Lesli Stone was in Radley?

00:33.430 --> 00:35.455
Long enough
to know Mona, and Charles.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.469
What about Sara? Why would
Lesli Stone go after a stranger?

00:38.500 --> 00:40.229
It was probably
just a rehearsal, Em.

00:40.270 --> 00:42.238
Until she could get
her hands on the real Alison.

00:42.270 --> 00:43.305
Okay, so what do we do now?

00:43.340 --> 00:45.205
I say we catch her in the act.

00:48.110 --> 00:51.102
Lesli Stone? That's crazy.

00:51.150 --> 00:53.277
That's what I said.
But maybe it's not.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.072
Okay, wait. You were
in a room with this person.

00:55.120 --> 00:57.384
Yeah, and they
were wearing a mask.

00:57.420 --> 00:59.786
Look, Mona's always been shady
about how she met this girl.

00:59.820 --> 01:02.482
And now we know why. They were
sharing a straitjacket.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.554
Spencer--

01:03.590 --> 01:04.727
Let's not forget that

01:04.760 --> 01:06.296
Mona got a gas mask.

01:06.330 --> 01:08.298
And she was passing out
juice-boxes while the rest of us

01:08.330 --> 01:10.469
were making sure
that we still had kidneys!

01:11.730 --> 01:13.436
What's takin' Hanna so long?

01:13.470 --> 01:17.167
I don't know, she probably has
to drag Mona here on a leash.

01:17.210 --> 01:20.702
Oh, Spencer, we saw
A jump off a building.

01:20.740 --> 01:22.173
A set up an underground bunker

01:22.210 --> 01:24.349
with more spy equipment
than the CIA.

01:24.380 --> 01:26.177
I mean, seriously, in your heart

01:26.220 --> 01:27.710
do you believe
that Lesli Stone could--

01:27.750 --> 01:29.445
People can surprise you.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.459
Mona maintained a 4.0 average
and perfect hair

01:32.490 --> 01:34.458
while she was tapping
Rosewood's police calls.

01:34.490 --> 01:36.378
Spencer, we jumped
on the Andrew train--

01:36.430 --> 01:37.681
But he didn't have a motive.

01:37.730 --> 01:40.551
This girl does. She thinks
that we killed Bethany!

01:43.930 --> 01:45.192
I can't get to her.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.333
- Why?
- Did Mona skip town?

01:46.370 --> 01:47.667
Mona's mom busted her

01:47.700 --> 01:48.894
for sneaking out to Radley.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.498
She's totally unplugged.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.337
Mona's not even
allowed to leave her room.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.870
Doesn't matter.
I'm not even sure Mona would be

01:53.910 --> 01:55.605
of any help anyways.

01:55.640 --> 01:59.212
Now you tell me? After I tried
to shimmy up her drainpipe?

01:59.250 --> 02:00.740
Okay, well, I have to go.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.418
My mom made an appointment
for me and her

02:02.450 --> 02:05.248
with Dr. Sullivan,
I can't be late.

02:05.290 --> 02:06.450
Where's Aria?

02:06.490 --> 02:07.718
She's up at Hollis,
she's sneaking

02:07.760 --> 02:09.887
Clark's negatives
back into that cubby.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.488
Okay, so what's the plan?

02:11.530 --> 02:12.895
Are we gonna
track down Lesli Stone?

02:12.930 --> 02:14.625
'Are we gonna go to Philly?‘

02:14.660 --> 02:17.697
- I have to get my head shrunk.
- 'Seriously?‘

02:17.730 --> 02:19.493
Wait, what is wrong
with you people?

02:19.540 --> 02:21.895
A is still out there,
we have to stick together

02:21.940 --> 02:25.137
and see if we can try
and catch this girl in the act.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.454
[dramatic music]

02:50.830 --> 02:52.195
Hey!

02:52.240 --> 02:54.663
'Did you see who
put this on my car?‘

02:54.700 --> 02:56.258
This card.

02:56.310 --> 02:59.234
Did you see
who put it under the wiper?

02:59.280 --> 03:01.737
Have you see anybody outside
of my house in the last hour?

03:01.780 --> 03:03.577
- Yes or no?
- No.

03:04.780 --> 03:06.714
[music continues]

03:10.790 --> 03:11.939
* Got a secret

03:11.990 --> 03:13.287
* Can you keep it?

03:13.320 --> 03:15.652
* Swear this one you'll save

03:15.690 --> 03:18.352
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:18.390 --> 03:20.699
* Taking this one to the grave

03:20.730 --> 03:23.290
* If I show you
that I know you *

03:23.330 --> 03:25.890
* Won't tell what I said

03:25.930 --> 03:28.330
* 'Cause two can keep a secret

03:28.370 --> 03:31.203
* If one of them is dead *

03:32.940 --> 03:34.237
[door opens]

03:34.280 --> 03:36.441
- 'Mornin'.‘
- Hey.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.643
- Um, 1-1 was just--
- Looking for somethin'?

03:41.520 --> 03:44.842
Uh, I was hoping it was a bagel
and cream cheese in there.

03:44.890 --> 03:46.619
Listen, here's the thing--

03:46.660 --> 03:48.412
I'm not mad.

03:48.460 --> 03:49.859
Uh, if you were
that uncomfortable with me

03:49.890 --> 03:52.256
taking photos of you,
you could've just said so.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.427
You didn't have
to go all klepto.

03:58.070 --> 03:59.332
So what's next

03:59.370 --> 04:00.462
for the morning bandit?

04:00.500 --> 04:03.435
Wanna grab that bagel for real?

04:03.470 --> 04:07.679
I can't, um, but I...
I will owe you one.

04:07.710 --> 04:09.234
Okay?

04:11.610 --> 04:13.316
(Hanna)
'1 really appreciate it.'

04:13.350 --> 04:15.477
Thanks. Have a nice day.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.355
[door opens]

04:22.390 --> 04:24.358
- 'Hey, Caleb.‘
- 'Hey, hope it's not early.‘

04:24.390 --> 04:25.618
(Ashley)
'No, not at all, come on in.'

04:25.660 --> 04:28.299
I was just about
to make some breakfast.

04:29.870 --> 04:30.825
Hey.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.764
What.. What is this
lump back here?

04:34.800 --> 04:37.360
I don't know. Lint.
I just woke up.

04:38.540 --> 04:39.905
Caleb, how would
you like your eggs?

04:39.940 --> 04:42.033
Um, mom, I can't eat breakfast.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.877
I have to go meet Spencer.

04:43.910 --> 04:45.377
Um, can I give you a lift?

04:45.410 --> 04:46.946
- No, I'm good.
- 'Wait.‘

04:46.980 --> 04:48.538
Where are you girls going?

04:48.580 --> 04:50.980
Spencer has
an appointment in Philly.

04:51.020 --> 04:52.578
And we're using the buddy system

04:52.620 --> 04:55.088
just like you asked us to.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.486
I'll call you later.

05:01.830 --> 05:03.388
[door opens]

05:04.100 --> 05:05.692
[door closes]

05:07.070 --> 05:11.336
Hey, Em? Which one should
I wear to Caleb's office?

05:11.370 --> 05:12.678
Um, your office

05:12.710 --> 05:13.369
is where Caleb plays

05:13.410 --> 05:15.071
Grand Theft Auto in his boxers.

05:15.110 --> 05:17.476
I just don't wanna screw up on
my first day.

05:17.510 --> 05:19.614
Everyone screws up
on their first day.

05:19.650 --> 05:22.380
That's what makes it
a first day.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.638
* Swingin' the door
to the to the backyard *

05:24.690 --> 05:26.555
* Got splinters
walkin' tight ropes *

05:26.590 --> 05:28.057
* Spun like a bandage

05:28.090 --> 05:31.480
* Touch on the outer surface..

05:31.530 --> 05:34.727
Do you still like it?
Or did I make a mistake?

05:34.760 --> 05:37.888
No. No, no, no.
That looks great, yeah.

05:37.930 --> 05:39.693
I'm the one who's _
gonna have to wear long johns

05:39.740 --> 05:42.561
in August so no one
sees my courage.

05:42.610 --> 05:45.363
* Magnetic
everything about you.. *

05:45.410 --> 05:48.072
Um, do you want me
to help you with that?

05:48.110 --> 05:49.441
Yeah.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.472
* Hypnotic takin' over me

05:54.520 --> 05:57.148
* Make me feel like
someone else *

05:57.190 --> 06:00.648
* You got me
tuckin' in my sleep *

06:00.690 --> 06:02.988
* I don't wanna
come back down.. *

06:03.030 --> 06:06.056
Here. You should wear this one.

06:06.090 --> 06:08.490
* Pacific Ocean dug so deep

06:08.530 --> 06:10.725
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

06:12.870 --> 06:14.895
* Aah aah aah *

06:24.950 --> 06:26.076
- Hey.l
- 'Hey.

06:26.110 --> 06:27.543
- Uh, did we--
- Oh, no, no, no.

06:27.580 --> 06:28.808
1-1 was just in the 'hood

06:28.850 --> 06:30.408
and I wanted
to drop something off.

06:30.450 --> 06:31.485
- Oh.
- Can I come in?

06:31.520 --> 06:33.613
Yeah, sure. Come on.

06:37.730 --> 06:38.879
What's that?

06:38.930 --> 06:41.125
My sponsor gave it to me.
Years ago.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.663
Uh, the guy who wrote it,
went through some heavy stuff.

06:43.700 --> 06:46.464
Alright, if you hate it,
might put you to sleep.

06:48.740 --> 06:49.934
Have you..

06:50.710 --> 06:51.904
What?

06:51.940 --> 06:53.532
Been sleeping, without help?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.605
Um, no. Not really.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.801
Uh, but my friend
is waiting for me in Philly.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.545
- So..
- Oh, right, um..

06:59.580 --> 07:01.218
- Sorry.
- There's one more thing.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.184
This way you don't
have to wrestle anyone

07:03.220 --> 07:04.949
to the ground
for the last brownie.

07:04.990 --> 07:06.810
Oh, my God.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.919
Thank you.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.451
Um, sorry.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.058
What's wrong?

07:14.100 --> 07:16.056
My sister in London
is texting me.

07:16.100 --> 07:19.069
My mother's enlisting allies
in the War over Commencement.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.658
You thinkin' of skippin' it?

07:20.700 --> 07:23.908
No, it's-it's not about going,
it's about speaking.

07:23.940 --> 07:25.635
My principal asked me
to stand up in front

07:25.670 --> 07:27.900
of the entire school and be
the Poster Girl for trauma.

07:27.940 --> 07:30.602
I'm just...really not
that into it.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.076
Why are you so sure?

07:34.120 --> 07:37.146
Well, why else would he
ask me to be valedictorian?

07:37.190 --> 07:40.717
I mean, I have incompletes in
every subject except for lunch.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.113
And everybody expects me
to stand up and give

07:42.160 --> 07:44.219
some really moving speech
about being a survivor.

07:44.260 --> 07:47.195
And I'm not ready to talk
about it as if it's over.

07:47.230 --> 07:49.698
When it's not...over.

07:51.870 --> 07:53.735
So don't do it.

07:53.770 --> 07:56.864
- What?
- 'Just say no.'

07:56.910 --> 07:59.003
Uh, considering everything
you've been through

07:59.040 --> 08:01.076
I think walking across
that stage and accepting

08:01.110 --> 08:04.671
a diploma is a pretty
impressive accomplishment.

08:04.710 --> 08:06.644
[cellphone ringing]

08:07.820 --> 08:09.685
Did your mom recruit
another relative?

08:09.720 --> 08:12.757
No, that's Hanna.
I really have to go.

08:12.790 --> 08:15.156
Uh, but I'll see you
at the meeting later?

08:15.190 --> 08:16.987
- You bet.
- Okay.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.692
- Thank you...for those.
- I'll see you soon.

08:26.870 --> 08:29.907
- Where are you?
- 'On the road, I got held up.'

08:29.940 --> 08:33.774
(Hanna)
'Well, she just raced
into her faculty lunch, |ate.'

08:33.810 --> 08:36.608
I mean, where was she?
Stuck at that junkyard?

08:36.650 --> 08:38.049
Wait, why were you held up?

08:38.080 --> 08:40.913
(Spencer)
'Dean stopped by, with a gift.‘

08:40.950 --> 08:44.784
Dean? Drug-free Dean?
Why was he giving you gifts?

08:44.820 --> 08:46.856
(Spencer)
'Because we're friends.‘

08:46.890 --> 08:49.279
Wow. Toby better
hurry back to Rosewood.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.982
(Spencer)
'Will you stop? What are we
doing when I get there?‘

08:52.030 --> 08:55.591
Stop asking questions.
Just drive faster. Hurry up.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.194
Okay, so the first thing
you're gonna learn

09:01.240 --> 09:04.209
to build is a CMS interface.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.037
I promise it's not
as complicated

09:06.070 --> 09:07.628
as I just made it sound.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.604
These days everyone
wants a responsive design

09:10.650 --> 09:12.641
that adjusts itself
to different screens.

09:12.680 --> 09:15.843
So the photo of...
Kimye will look the same

09:15.880 --> 09:18.986
on your phone, your smart pad,
and your computer.

09:19.020 --> 09:20.658
What's Kimye?

09:20.690 --> 09:23.352
Kanye and Kim?

09:23.390 --> 09:25.654
Yeah, right. You wouldn't, uh..

09:27.130 --> 09:28.927
You've been..

09:28.960 --> 09:32.066
You know what actually?
You don't even need to know.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.829
No one does.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.707
Hey, I'm sorry.
That..

09:38.740 --> 09:40.332
That whole Kimye thing
was just a joke.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.008
I've got a lot
of catching up to do.

09:45.150 --> 09:48.938
It's exhausting bein'
on the outside all the time.

09:48.980 --> 09:50.880
Yeah.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.059
Well, at least you, uh,
you have the other girls

09:53.090 --> 09:54.955
to connect with.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.598
What do you know
about Alison DiLaurentis?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.868
I wouldn't ask, but..

10:03.900 --> 10:06.061
...when you're forced to answer
to someone else's name

10:06.100 --> 10:08.762
and wear their clothes..

10:08.800 --> 10:10.700
...you become curious about her.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.738
Why haven't you talked to Emily?

10:13.780 --> 10:15.771
I've tried, but every time

10:15.810 --> 10:18.802
I bring her up,
Emily shuts down.

10:18.850 --> 10:21.148
Do you think Alison knows
who did this to us?

10:23.320 --> 10:26.778
Well, if she does, that person's
not long for this world.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.022
Look, I'm sorry. I wish I had
more answers for you, but..

10:33.760 --> 10:36.866
The truth is, I'm on
the outside looking in too.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.958
I hate it.

10:48.210 --> 10:49.279
Hi, there.

10:49.310 --> 10:51.005
I'm so embarrassed.

10:51.050 --> 10:53.041
I thought I put my ticket
in my bag but I can't find it.

10:53.080 --> 10:57.016
And now I'm thinking I may have
used it to throw away my gum.

10:59.350 --> 11:01.910
Um, which one is yours?

11:02.790 --> 11:04.826
Ugh. God, this is so weird.

11:04.860 --> 11:06.896
Um, I just got it back
from the dealership

11:06.930 --> 11:08.329
and they changed the keychain.

11:08.360 --> 11:11.397
But it's a dark green
Range Rover. Tan interior--

11:11.430 --> 11:13.159
I need the ticket, miss.

11:13.200 --> 11:16.033
Have you checked your pockets?

11:16.070 --> 11:17.662
Well..

11:18.970 --> 11:20.676
I thought that I
checked everything.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.308
[sighs]

11:22.340 --> 11:23.341
Maybe you left it on the table.

11:23.380 --> 11:25.007
Oh, come on, you know the car.

11:25.050 --> 11:27.177
It has, like, a HanNick
bumper sticker on the back.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.984
Really nice smell inside.
Like, cinnamon toast.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.946
Seriously?

11:31.990 --> 11:34.049
You honestly don't remember me?

11:34.090 --> 11:35.955
Oh, God, that really hurts.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.997
I mean, fine, I'll just
walk back to New Jersey.

11:40.430 --> 11:41.954
Miss?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.218
I...I think I know the car.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.376
Ugh. That's it.

11:53.410 --> 11:55.139
Thank God one of us has a brain.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.104
[cellphone ringing]

12:01.220 --> 12:03.142
- What's your ETA?
- 'I'm almost there.‘

12:03.190 --> 12:05.112
Okay, well,
there's an alley right when you

12:05.150 --> 12:06.811
turn right on Front Street,
meet me there.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.259
(Spencer)
'Are you stealing her car?‘

12:08.290 --> 12:09.826
No, I am borrowing it.

12:09.860 --> 12:12.351
Don't get all preachy
with me, Puff 'n' Stuff.

12:12.390 --> 12:13.755
I gotta go.

12:18.430 --> 12:19.761
[sighs]

12:22.370 --> 12:24.099
You saved my life.

12:24.140 --> 12:25.129
Love you.

12:31.910 --> 12:34.014
[pop music]

12:37.420 --> 12:41.015
Hi, um, does Emily Fields
still work here?

12:41.060 --> 12:41.958
'Oh.l

12:41.990 --> 12:45.153
Sorry, I...heard you
talking about Emily.

12:45.190 --> 12:47.454
No, she-she doesn't work
here at the moment.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.922
Okay.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.518
But I'm-I'm Ezra Fitz,
I'm the owner.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.162
I can pass along any..

12:52.200 --> 12:53.189
Wait, wait, wait.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.434
Ezra?

12:54.470 --> 12:55.539
Why-why do I know that name?

12:55.570 --> 12:58.004
I-I feel like Emily
had a teacher.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.109
Yes, that would be me.

12:59.140 --> 13:01.108
I had bit of a career change.

13:01.140 --> 13:02.971
- I'm Nicolle Gordon.
- I.

13:03.010 --> 13:04.272
I worked with Emily in Haiti.

13:04.310 --> 13:05.299
We did that housing program.

13:05.350 --> 13:06.578
Oh, yes. That's right.

13:06.610 --> 13:07.975
She had an amazing summer
with you guys.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.146
Yeah, that's what
I thought, but then

13:09.180 --> 13:10.886
she changed her e-mail
and her number

13:10.920 --> 13:12.387
and never sent me an update.

13:12.420 --> 13:14.559
Well, I mean, she had to..

13:14.590 --> 13:16.012
...change everything.

13:17.390 --> 13:19.221
After the trial.

13:19.260 --> 13:21.592
When was the last time
you two spoke?

13:21.630 --> 13:24.121
I've been in India
the past eight months.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.364
What trial?

13:28.470 --> 13:31.007
(Aria)
I mean, someone must've
seen something, right?

13:31.040 --> 13:32.564
A had to have been trailing us
the whole time

13:32.610 --> 13:33.838
and we weren't
the only ones here.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.302
Yeah.

13:35.340 --> 13:37.444
There's a guy that runs
this place, but I don't see him.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.345
[wind chimes chiming]

13:39.380 --> 13:41.541
Um, Em?

13:41.580 --> 13:43.218
It's kinda hard
to hunt for clues

13:43.250 --> 13:44.945
and pick emojis
at the same time.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.015
Sorry. I was just
checking with Sara.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.381
I wanted to see how
her first day was going.

13:49.420 --> 13:51.081
Hmm.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.621
Well, you two seem to have
gotten pretty close.

13:53.660 --> 13:56.220
Well, yeah.
She's staying with me.

13:56.260 --> 13:57.329
For how long?

13:57.370 --> 14:00.533
I told you guys.
She has a bad home life.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.037
And we all had things
to come back to.

14:02.070 --> 14:04.209
People who love us.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.606
I was just wondering what it was
like for her down there.

14:06.640 --> 14:09.074
What she was thinkin'
about in the dark..

14:09.110 --> 14:10.839
...got her through it.

14:12.380 --> 14:13.847
Clark?

14:14.620 --> 14:18.249
Hi. What..
What are you doing here?

14:18.290 --> 14:20.258
Just came back
to take some new pictures.

14:20.290 --> 14:22.087
Somebody stole mine
this morning.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.952
Oh, Em, this is Clark.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.480
The photographer
I met at Hollis.

14:26.530 --> 14:27.952
Nice to meet you.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.968
So what are you doing here?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.628
When I got home
I-I realized I lost my tripod.

14:32.670 --> 14:34.365
I thought I must've
left it here.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.492
Well, let me help you look.

14:35.540 --> 14:36.495
Oh, no. That's fine.

14:36.540 --> 14:38.201
Emily offered to help, so..

14:38.240 --> 14:41.903
Hey, um, a friend of mine
is looking for me at The Brew.

14:41.940 --> 14:42.975
What friend?

14:43.010 --> 14:45.171
Nicole, from my Habitat trip.

14:45.210 --> 14:47.678
I didn't even know
she was on the same hemisphere.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.676
Okay, well, do we
need to leave right now?

14:49.720 --> 14:51.915
If you wanna stay
and look around

14:51.950 --> 14:53.110
I can drive you home.

14:54.520 --> 14:55.885
Great.

14:57.590 --> 14:59.888
Yeah, I..
How could I say no?

15:01.600 --> 15:04.125
(Spencer)
What kind of lab did you say
Lesli worked at?

15:04.170 --> 15:06.297
I don't know.
It was at a college. Why?

15:06.330 --> 15:08.332
Maybe this key card
could help us get in there.

15:08.370 --> 15:10.565
How fast do you think
Caleb can make a copy?

15:10.610 --> 15:12.066
(Hanna)
'1 have no idea.‘

15:12.110 --> 15:14.101
God, this girl's such a slob.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.149
Ugh, she has this
hairbrush back here

15:17.180 --> 15:18.977
that smells like a cat box.

15:19.010 --> 15:20.216
Well, what's Caleb
doing right now?

15:20.250 --> 15:21.672
Why do you keep
asking me about Caleb?

15:21.720 --> 15:23.449
Why do your shoulders go up
every time I say his name?

15:23.490 --> 15:26.516
- Are you guys still--
- No, we're nothing, okay?

15:26.550 --> 15:29.053
Hanna? Don't lock Caleb out.

15:29.090 --> 15:30.455
Believe me, I can't.

15:30.490 --> 15:32.151
My mom keeps letting him in.

15:32.190 --> 15:34.021
I mean, they eat meals
together now

15:34.060 --> 15:35.925
because I won't
let him cut my meat.

15:37.730 --> 15:39.459
What is she using this for?

15:39.500 --> 15:40.967
Those are wire cutters.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.399
Why does she need to cut wires?

15:42.440 --> 15:44.305
Why does Caleb
wanna cut your meat?

15:44.340 --> 15:47.207
Because he thinks
I'm weak and I'm not.

15:49.440 --> 15:50.646
'Oh, my God.‘

15:50.680 --> 15:54.047
She has, like, ten pairs of
these grandma glasses in here.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.616
Okay, look,
I'm gonna text Caleb.

15:55.650 --> 15:56.639
No,donT.

15:56.680 --> 15:58.045
We need his help to copy this.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.341
I'm not gonna tell him why.

15:59.390 --> 16:00.948
[cellphone beeps]

16:01.590 --> 16:03.979
Oh, my God.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.327
I can see better with these.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.590
I needed glasses this whole time
and I never knew it.

16:07.630 --> 16:09.188
Let me see.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.258
Give me another pair.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.207
There's no prescription
in these.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.537
- What?
- They're clear.

16:21.580 --> 16:24.208
They're fake. She has multiple
pairs of fake glasses.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.400
God, this girl
is fooling everyone.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.159
Oh, my God.

16:36.090 --> 16:37.682
What? What's inside the boxes?

16:37.730 --> 16:39.425
They're unassembled cages.

16:39.460 --> 16:40.654
Cages? For what?

16:40.700 --> 16:42.224
They're not for gerbils, Hanna.

16:42.260 --> 16:44.569
There's four of them
and each one is big enough for..

16:44.600 --> 16:46.329
- What?
- For us.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.568
So have you incinerated
those negatives yet?

16:52.310 --> 16:53.038
Not yet.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.479
I mean, I'd understand
if you did.

16:54.510 --> 16:56.501
You must feel like
you're under a microscope.

16:56.540 --> 16:59.100
Police watching you,
parents watching you.

16:59.150 --> 17:01.778
Yeah, well, hopefully
that'll all stop soon.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.378
Yeah. Wait. What?

17:03.420 --> 17:04.785
What do you mean?

17:04.820 --> 17:06.742
Have they actually
caught the guy?

17:06.790 --> 17:08.109
Uh, no, not yet.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.378
But they're,
they're pretty close.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.182
How do you know?

17:12.230 --> 17:14.357
Sorry. I don't mean to pry.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.197
Oh..

17:16.230 --> 17:17.629
You know what?
Maybe we should just go.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.262
Hey, hold on. This..

17:20.300 --> 17:23.133
This is where we were
the other day.

17:23.170 --> 17:24.660
Yeah, yeah.
I'll check over there.

17:24.710 --> 17:25.802
You check back there.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.432
Okay.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.436
[dramatic music]

17:54.840 --> 17:57.138
[music intensifies]

18:04.810 --> 18:07.074
[pop music]

18:09.450 --> 18:11.111
(Emily)
'Nicole?‘

18:11.150 --> 18:12.845
Hi.

18:12.890 --> 18:14.380
[chuckles]

18:15.520 --> 18:18.250
Well, at least you still
look like Emily.

18:18.290 --> 18:19.359
What are you doing here?

18:19.390 --> 18:20.652
Well, we finished the project.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.156
So I came back to see my dad

18:22.200 --> 18:24.168
and thought I'd make
a little detour.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.589
Hey, do, um,
either of you want coffee?

18:26.630 --> 18:27.631
- Yeah.
- I-I'|| do it.

18:27.670 --> 18:28.830
No, no, no.
I will get it.

18:28.870 --> 18:30.303
Sit. Visit.

18:30.340 --> 18:32.433
[music continues]

18:39.250 --> 18:42.413
Ezra...told you, didn't he?

18:42.450 --> 18:44.213
Don't be mad at him, please.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.740
No. I-it's okay.

18:45.790 --> 18:47.485
I'd rather you find out
the story from him

18:47.520 --> 18:49.659
than me having
to tell it again.

18:52.430 --> 18:55.126
Um, doesn't your dad
live in Florida?

18:55.500 --> 18:57.297
Yeah.

18:57.330 --> 18:59.491
Alright, so you were
more than just a little detour

18:59.530 --> 19:01.794
but, um, I didn't want to do
this over the phone.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.239
Thank you.

19:03.270 --> 19:04.908
What's goin' on?

19:04.940 --> 19:06.362
I'm a supervisor now

19:06.410 --> 19:08.628
and I have been asked
to put together a team

19:08.680 --> 19:11.774
for an eight week project
in Thailand.

19:11.810 --> 19:14.779
And I have this crazy idea

19:14.820 --> 19:17.687
of reuniting our Caribbean crew.

19:17.720 --> 19:19.312
Is that crazy?

19:19.350 --> 19:21.386
- Uh, when does it start?
- Mid-June.

19:21.420 --> 19:22.648
So basically, you could just fly

19:22.690 --> 19:23.452
there in your cap and gown.

19:23.490 --> 19:25.185
But I'd.. I would
want you to change

19:25.230 --> 19:26.720
before you pick up a power tool.

19:29.300 --> 19:32.895
- You already made summer plans?
- No.

19:32.930 --> 19:35.535
You-you think it's a bit
far from home?

19:35.570 --> 19:36.639
No.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.228
You heard they have
bugs down there

19:38.270 --> 19:39.635
the size of your head?

19:39.670 --> 19:41.604
No. Yeah, yes.

19:41.640 --> 19:42.675
[chuckles]

19:42.710 --> 19:44.575
It's not that, it's just..

19:47.650 --> 19:50.414
I'm still adjusting
to being back.

19:50.450 --> 19:54.511
And my mom has me
in intensive therapy..

19:54.560 --> 19:58.428
I'm trying to help a new friend
deal with everything and..

20:00.300 --> 20:01.528
You know what, I..

20:01.560 --> 20:04.461
...I shouldn't be throwing
this at you right now.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.491
I only brought it up
because I remember

20:06.530 --> 20:08.760
when you
got off that plane..

20:08.800 --> 20:10.939
...YOU were a mess.

20:10.970 --> 20:13.905
But within weeks,
you had that..

20:13.940 --> 20:16.238
...light in your eyes.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.646
Helping other people
really seemed to..

20:20.320 --> 20:21.571
It did.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.840
And it-it will again.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.312
You know, there'll be
other trips.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.510
I'm in.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.755
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

20:29.790 --> 20:31.587
I wanna do this one.

20:31.630 --> 20:32.688
Are you sure?

20:32.730 --> 20:34.254
Can I bring a friend?

20:36.560 --> 20:38.960
You sure you don't want
some coffee or something?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.831
No, I'm okay.
Thank you.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.467
Um, you said
he'll be back in..

20:43.510 --> 20:45.501
He's just pickin' up lunch.

20:45.540 --> 20:46.768
Cool.

20:50.910 --> 20:52.878
I know, I should just ask
the gym to give me a new card

20:52.910 --> 20:55.743
but they always
charge me so much.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.287
[cellphone beeps]

21:05.360 --> 21:06.725
(Spencer)
'Oh, God.‘

21:09.060 --> 21:10.994
Everything okay?

21:11.030 --> 21:13.590
Yeah. It's fine.
It's just my mom.

21:18.570 --> 21:20.572
Can I ask you a question?

21:24.750 --> 21:26.900
Did anybody..

21:26.950 --> 21:28.747
...ever ask you
to talk about it?

21:29.850 --> 21:31.010
Um..

21:31.050 --> 21:32.039
Well..

21:32.090 --> 21:34.684
...my mom
keeps asking me to..

21:36.390 --> 21:38.824
...I guess some reporters
offered money.

21:41.730 --> 21:42.822
Who's asking you?

21:43.970 --> 21:46.996
Um, my school,
at graduation.

21:47.030 --> 21:48.566
Oh, right.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.660
Emily told me.
You're the brainiac.

21:51.710 --> 21:53.371
That's not me.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.969
I wish I had paid more
attention at school.

21:57.010 --> 21:58.477
Why?

21:58.510 --> 22:00.102
I mean when I think about
how much I used to sweat

22:00.150 --> 22:03.017
homework assignments
and exams.

22:03.050 --> 22:04.938
It's just a bunch
of wasted energy.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.412
None of it matters.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.657
I don't know.

22:08.690 --> 22:09.759
[sighs]

22:09.790 --> 22:10.779
IfI could explain

22:10.830 --> 22:12.684
how it felt to be
down there

22:12.730 --> 22:15.358
and how it feels
to be up here

22:15.400 --> 22:17.322
I'd want everyone
to hear it.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.708
[pop music]

22:41.960 --> 22:44.884
[music continues]

22:52.870 --> 22:53.962
Hey, you.

22:54.870 --> 22:56.428
Hey, hi.

22:56.470 --> 22:58.028
I'm just waiting
for an order to..

22:58.070 --> 23:00.777
...take home
and, uh, eat.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.547
You don't need a book.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.740
I was just killing time.

23:11.790 --> 23:14.657
Caleb, we may never know
what happened to her.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.579
And maybe she'll
tell you or me

23:18.630 --> 23:20.894
or Dr. Sullivan,
but maybe she won't.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.039
I'm not even trying
to force her to, you know.

23:29.070 --> 23:30.935
I'm not trying
to smother her.

23:33.170 --> 23:34.637
I know.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.500
I know and I think

23:37.550 --> 23:41.008
on some level...she knows too.

23:43.050 --> 23:44.745
[sighs]
She just..

23:45.920 --> 23:48.411
She likes to_
keep you guessmg.

23:52.730 --> 23:56.791
You know...after
her dad and I split up

23:56.830 --> 23:58.468
Hanna moved into my bedroom

23:58.500 --> 23:59.819
and we would watch
mowes late at night.

23:59.870 --> 24:04.660
And she would laugh
at the sad parts

24:04.710 --> 24:07.065
and she'd sob
at the jokes.

24:07.110 --> 24:09.032
* It gets better

24:09.080 --> 24:12.106
* It gets better.. *

24:12.150 --> 24:14.710
Ijust feel like
I've lost her.

24:16.750 --> 24:20.481
I think I saw a glimpse of
the Hanna we know last night.

24:22.090 --> 24:23.580
She left the freezer
door open

24:23.630 --> 24:26.155
and defrosted like $80
worth of groceries.

24:26.190 --> 24:27.691
[chuckles]

24:27.730 --> 24:29.789
And after I marched
upstairs and yelled at her

24:29.830 --> 24:32.663
she looked up at me
and she was thrilled.

24:34.870 --> 24:36.565
I'm not suggesting
you yell at her.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.862
I'm just..

24:39.740 --> 24:42.903
Just remember underneath it all,
she is still in there.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.643
It's not just
the junkyard, Emily

24:48.680 --> 24:50.841
it's the bottle of
hair color in the darkroom

24:50.890 --> 24:52.619
the text in Sullivan's office.

24:52.650 --> 24:54.254
I mean, how did A know
we were all gonna be there

24:54.290 --> 24:56.019
at the exact same time?

24:56.060 --> 24:58.858
(Emily on phone)
'Aria, it's always
been that way.'

24:58.890 --> 24:59.879
[knock on door]

25:00.760 --> 25:02.250
(Emily on phone)
Uh, hello?

25:02.300 --> 25:03.995
'Are you there?‘

25:04.030 --> 25:07.022
Um, Em, I-I gotta go,
Ezra's here.

25:10.640 --> 25:11.732
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:11.770 --> 25:13.806
Um, so, I was just
gonna drop this off

25:13.840 --> 25:17.071
but _then I saw
your car In the driveway.

25:17.110 --> 25:18.270
You left your application

25:18.310 --> 25:20.175
for the photo competition
at The Brew.

25:20.210 --> 25:22.610
Oh, thank you.

25:22.650 --> 25:25.084
And I-I saw that you
needed a recommendation

25:25.120 --> 25:26.985
so I wrote you one.

25:27.020 --> 25:29.056
Which I know is-is
very presumptuous

25:29.090 --> 25:30.853
and if you want
somebody else to write it--

25:30.890 --> 25:33.029
No.

25:33.060 --> 25:34.322
No, I mean..

25:34.360 --> 25:35.725
[chuckles]

25:35.760 --> 25:37.660
Who knows me
better than you do?

25:44.170 --> 25:45.762
Wow.

25:45.810 --> 25:47.778
And you definitely used
your creative writing skills.

25:47.810 --> 25:51.576
When.. When did I have
a solo exhibit at The Brew?

25:51.610 --> 25:53.919
I might have
embellished slightly.

25:53.950 --> 25:55.349
But I mean, I do have
your self-portrait

25:55.380 --> 25:57.644
hangin' above my desk.

26:02.220 --> 26:04.085
Well, I appreciate it.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.553
- Thank you.
- Yeah, anytime.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.920
Whoa, what is that?

26:13.270 --> 26:14.635
Uh..

26:17.270 --> 26:18.259
I did that.

26:18.310 --> 26:21.074
For my photos.

26:21.110 --> 26:24.841
Well, that-that
certainly is...disturbing.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.347
Not sure if I'd
wanna have that

26:26.380 --> 26:27.916
hangin' above my desk.

26:35.690 --> 26:37.783
[instrumental music]

26:44.200 --> 26:45.189
[car door closes]

26:46.330 --> 26:49.037
I meant to call you,
I'm so sorry.

26:50.140 --> 26:52.233
- Where are you going?
- To my car.

26:52.270 --> 26:54.773
Look, I-I, I'm sorry,
I didn't make it today.

26:54.810 --> 26:58.246
Ijust came by to make sure
you're okay, and you are.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.702
See ya.

26:59.750 --> 27:01.741
Hold up. Can you please
let me explain?

27:03.690 --> 27:06.909
I-I skipped today's
meeting because I..

27:06.950 --> 27:09.054
I decided that I'm gonna
write that speech after all.

27:09.090 --> 27:11.388
I don't give a crap
about the speech.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.125
Don't you get it?

27:13.160 --> 27:15.219
Uh, in my life,
when someone doesn't show up

27:15.260 --> 27:17.865
or answer the phone, there is
a very real possibility

27:17.900 --> 27:19.868
that they're lying in
a gutter somewhere.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.765
I didn't..

27:22.800 --> 27:24.859
- I didn't realize--
- Yeah, I know.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.907
I'm sorry.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.776
I know.

27:39.050 --> 27:41.757
Will you at least come inside
and have a cup of coffee?

27:44.790 --> 27:46.428
I can't see you anymore.

27:46.460 --> 27:48.018
What?

27:48.060 --> 27:50.028
Why? Are you seriously gonna
cut me out of your life

27:50.060 --> 27:51.391
because I skipped one meeting?

27:51.430 --> 27:53.125
No, I need to stop
seeing you.

27:53.170 --> 27:56.958
Because every time
you're near me, I..

27:57.000 --> 27:59.935
I just wanna grab you
and kiss you.

27:59.970 --> 28:03.804
And the fact that you have
a boyfriend isn't the problem.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.148
The problem is,
I don't care.

28:06.180 --> 28:09.115
[instrumental music]

28:18.760 --> 28:20.022
[car door closes]

28:22.530 --> 28:24.464
- Hey.
- God, Caleb.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.923
I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean
to freak you out.

28:26.970 --> 28:29.962
I let myself in.
Your mom made me a key.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.730
- Of course, she did.
- Hanna, knock it off.

28:32.770 --> 28:34.078
Knock what off?

28:34.110 --> 28:35.202
I'm_not the one
who just shows up

28:35.240 --> 28:37.105
at someone's door
for no reason.

28:38.510 --> 28:40.239
I have a reason.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.014
[pop music]

28:55.360 --> 28:58.989
* If we had our way

28:59.030 --> 29:02.488
* There'd always be tomorrow

29:02.540 --> 29:05.737
* And if it's all the same

29:08.040 --> 29:10.907
* We're burnin' like fire

29:11.950 --> 29:15.374
* Fire yeah

29:15.420 --> 29:17.069
*Hm*

29:21.060 --> 29:22.186
Sara?

29:22.220 --> 29:23.926
What are you doing?
What happened?

29:23.960 --> 29:26.986
I will pay for the bike
if-if they can't fix it.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.349
No, what happened to you?

29:28.400 --> 29:29.492
And if this
doesn't come out

29:29.530 --> 29:30.895
I'll replace
the whole carpet--

29:30.930 --> 29:32.522
Hey, Sara, stop.
Talk to me.

29:32.570 --> 29:34.231
How did you get hurt?

29:34.270 --> 29:36.261
Were you in an accident?

29:36.300 --> 29:37.528
I don't know.

29:37.570 --> 29:38.832
[sobbing]
I don't know.

29:38.870 --> 29:40.531
You don't know what?

29:40.570 --> 29:43.209
If it happened on purpose.

29:43.240 --> 29:47.870
I-I turned onto that street
behind the school

29:47.920 --> 29:50.047
and I felt like I was
being followed.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.388
By who?

29:51.420 --> 29:53.980
There was this dark car,
it was going real slow.

29:54.020 --> 29:55.351
Did the car hit you?

29:55.390 --> 29:59.884
It suddenly sped up,
and...the side mirror

29:59.930 --> 30:03.388
smashed into my elbow and..

30:03.430 --> 30:05.295
...I-I have to clean this up
before your mom sees it.

30:05.330 --> 30:07.423
No, you don't.
I'll do it, okay?

30:07.470 --> 30:08.459
Just look at me.

30:08.500 --> 30:09.933
IfI show you a picture

30:09.970 --> 30:12.336
can you tell me
if it was the same car?

30:12.370 --> 30:13.837
Okay.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.269
Look, is this it?

30:18.310 --> 30:19.902
[Sara sighs]

30:19.950 --> 30:22.043
- I think so.
- Okay, listen to me.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.479
We may have figured out
who's doing this.

30:23.520 --> 30:24.612
Who is we?

30:24.650 --> 30:27.118
Sarah, you're safe
in this house, okay?

30:27.150 --> 30:29.880
A-and in three weeks, you and I
can both get outta here.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.059
- We'll get on a plane and--
- What?

30:32.090 --> 30:34.024
A program I did
a couple summers ago.

30:34.060 --> 30:35.322
They're going to Thailand.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.021
And my supervisor said
that I could take you.

30:37.060 --> 30:39.597
My mother won't let me
leave the country.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.029
What if we talk
to your caseworker?

30:41.070 --> 30:43.436
She can't help me.
No one can.

30:43.470 --> 30:45.461
Sara, I can help you, okay?

30:45.510 --> 30:47.432
I won't let anything
happen to you.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.648
(Aria)
Lesli experiments on animals?

30:57.680 --> 31:00.319
(Hanna)
Of course she does. What do
you think we are to her?

31:00.350 --> 31:02.489
(Spencer)
You guys, less talking,
more looking.

31:02.520 --> 31:06.388
- Which one is her desk?
- Umm...wait, this is it.

31:06.430 --> 31:09.422
Alright. What am I supposed
to be looking for?

31:09.460 --> 31:11.360
Well, she's furnished
an underground bunker

31:11.400 --> 31:13.391
so I'm guessing she must
have a stack of receipts

31:13.430 --> 31:15.330
the size of a phone book.

31:16.500 --> 31:19.435
So, Ezra came to my house.

31:19.470 --> 31:21.529
I came really close
to telling him.

31:21.580 --> 31:22.933
Telling him what?

31:22.980 --> 31:25.949
About why we're here.
Everything.

31:25.980 --> 31:27.948
I hate lying to him.

31:27.980 --> 31:29.379
Okay, but you guys
aren't even together anymore

31:29.420 --> 31:30.546
so why do you feel like
you owe him?

31:30.580 --> 31:32.116
No, it's not about owing him

31:32.150 --> 31:34.948
it's just who I turn to
in times like this

31:34.990 --> 31:37.185
who makes me feel safe.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.299
Is that really fair to him?

31:45.330 --> 31:47.161
[beeping]

31:48.440 --> 31:50.396
What the hell was that?

[beeping]

31:59.980 --> 32:01.447
[beeping]

32:07.750 --> 32:10.548
Spencer, what are you..
What are you doing?

32:10.590 --> 32:12.251
- Shh, shh.
- Wait.

32:12.290 --> 32:15.919
Why am I beeping? I haven't even
stolen anything yet.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.461
[beeping]

32:20.300 --> 32:23.667
Spencer! Say something!
Why are we, like, radioactive?

32:23.700 --> 32:25.702
Bitch chipped us.

32:25.740 --> 32:28.072
[dramatic music]

32:34.680 --> 32:36.375
She chipped us?

She friggin' chipped us?

32:38.750 --> 32:41.014
- Well, how do we get it out?
- She chipped us in the bunker.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.459
That's why we were drugged.

32:42.490 --> 32:44.720
Yeah, just like every other
animal she sicced on us.

32:44.760 --> 32:47.024
Birds, snakes, wild horses.

32:47.060 --> 32:49.199
Okay, we can stand here
and list A's greatest hits

32:49.230 --> 32:51.266
but we still need something
real to give to the police.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.325
So, Aria, please keep on
checking the desks.

32:53.370 --> 32:55.292
Hanna, let's check
these shelves.

32:55.340 --> 32:57.865
Why can't we just
hand over our heads?

33:01.740 --> 33:04.277
[pop music]

33:04.310 --> 33:07.302
Hey, um, the copy shop's printer
ran out of ink

33:07.350 --> 33:11.081
so I may have to show you
the good pictures on my phone.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.285
I can't go.

33:13.320 --> 33:15.049
Why? Wh-what happened?
Did your mom..

33:15.090 --> 33:16.614
No, i-it's not my mom.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.787
I..

33:18.830 --> 33:21.048
The friend I wanted to bring

33:21.100 --> 33:23.694
I can't leave her behind.

33:23.730 --> 33:27.097
Her home situation's a disaster.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.336
You know, she's still
trying to figure out

33:28.370 --> 33:31.032
how to stand on her own and..

33:31.540 --> 33:33.667
...and..

33:33.710 --> 33:36.508
You're the only thing
holding her up.

33:36.540 --> 33:39.748
You know, I've only known her
for a couple of weeks, but..

33:39.780 --> 33:42.578
...it's just been intense.

33:42.620 --> 33:46.112
She's still trapped
in a nightmare.

33:46.790 --> 33:49.418
Well, I-I think you all are.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.653
You're right.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.827
But there are moments
when I'm with her

33:56.860 --> 34:00.091
and I completely forget.

34:00.130 --> 34:02.269
You know, it's like,
she's helping me more

34:02.300 --> 34:04.404
than I'm helping her.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.406
Em..

34:08.440 --> 34:12.809
...is Sara capable
of returning your feelings?

34:12.850 --> 34:16.775
What? No, no, no, that-that's
not what I'm feeling.

34:16.820 --> 34:18.617
I'm just..

34:21.420 --> 34:23.354
I'm sorry, you came
all the way out here

34:23.390 --> 34:27.258
and I should've waited a day
to give you an answer.

34:27.290 --> 34:30.748
Well, I-I don't know
about you, but..

34:30.800 --> 34:33.462
...I'm still really glad
I made the trip.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.178
[squeaking]

35:01.800 --> 35:04.098
[dramatic music]

35:19.210 --> 35:21.212
Can anybody hear me?

35:33.360 --> 35:35.294
Hanna, what are you doing?

35:35.330 --> 35:37.821
She doesn't get to keep anybody
in cages anymore.

35:37.860 --> 35:40.465
- Stop.
- I'm letting them out.

35:40.500 --> 35:41.592
Hanna, get away from the window

35:41.640 --> 35:42.766
you're gonna set off
the alarm.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.233
- I don't care.
- What?

35:44.270 --> 35:45.339
You will when
the campus police show up!

35:45.370 --> 35:46.803
Just get away from the window.

35:46.840 --> 35:47.909
[Hanna gasping]

35:47.940 --> 35:49.635
Oh, oh.

35:50.310 --> 35:51.868
Okay, stay back.

35:51.910 --> 35:53.172
'Move really slowly.'

35:53.210 --> 35:55.269
These are not cuddly animals.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.276
Ah! Wait, why is it
moving like that?

35:57.320 --> 35:58.639
Is it on speed or something?

35:58.690 --> 36:00.715
Hanna, it's a lab! It could be
on a lot of things, okay?

36:00.750 --> 36:02.183
Starting with anthrax!

36:02.220 --> 36:03.812
Just stay calm.

36:03.860 --> 36:05.487
Guys, hey.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.225
- 'Check out this invoice.‘
- Aria.

36:07.260 --> 36:08.921
She just ordered like a dozen..

36:08.960 --> 36:10.359
[screaming]

36:10.400 --> 36:11.594
Don't scream,
you're gonna make it worse.

36:11.630 --> 36:12.927
Is there another light
we can turn on?

36:12.970 --> 36:14.562
No. They're nocturnal, okay?

36:14.600 --> 36:15.760
I don't wanna
traumatize them any more

36:15.800 --> 36:16.960
than they already have been.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.467
We just need to get them
back in their cages.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.932
- Them?
- Yes, there's rats too.

36:19.970 --> 36:21.608
And they jump.

36:23.010 --> 36:25.308
Do you guys have any food?

36:27.010 --> 36:29.319
Do they eat cheese sticks?

36:36.460 --> 36:38.223
Hey, Spencer, not all of them,
that's my dinner.

36:38.260 --> 36:39.579
Shut up.

36:39.630 --> 36:41.598
[squeaking]

36:49.600 --> 36:50.737
[screaming]

36:50.770 --> 36:52.533
Shh.

36:52.570 --> 36:54.674
(Spencer)
'What are you doing?‘

36:55.680 --> 36:56.806
[screaming]

36:56.840 --> 36:57.829
(Spencer)
What just happened?

36:57.880 --> 36:59.541
Why'd the lights go out?

37:00.480 --> 37:02.277
Have you guys lost your minds?

37:04.750 --> 37:06.286
Mona, you followed us
here again?

37:06.320 --> 37:07.685
Why did you turn
the lights off?

37:07.720 --> 37:09.779
So the security guard
wouldn't see us.

37:09.820 --> 37:12.425
Us? Oh, save it, Mona.
You are not one of us.

37:12.460 --> 37:13.620
You're working for A.

37:13.660 --> 37:15.457
You and_Lesli Stone
are gomg down.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.853
We have what_ we need
and we're givmg it

37:16.900 --> 37:18.993
straight to the police.

37:19.030 --> 37:20.588
This college will prosecute.

37:20.630 --> 37:22.029
'I'm just trying to save you
from yourselves.‘

37:22.070 --> 37:23.367
Cut the crap, Mona!

37:23.400 --> 37:24.867
The only thing
you're trying to protect

37:24.910 --> 37:26.434
is Lesli's vendetta against us.

37:26.470 --> 37:27.937
Yeah, which is crazy
because we had nothing to do

37:27.970 --> 37:29.403
with what happened
to Bethany!

37:30.740 --> 37:32.708
until she was found
in Alison's grave!

37:32.750 --> 37:34.809
Her friend? Where did it
say in Lesli's file

37:34.850 --> 37:36.408
that she was friends
with Bethany Young?

37:36.450 --> 37:38.680
- She hated that girl.
- 'Oh, really?‘

37:38.720 --> 37:40.517
And I suppose
she hated Charles too?

37:40.550 --> 37:42.757
So much that she had to start
pretending to be him.

37:42.790 --> 37:44.621
Lesli is not pretending
to be Charles.

37:44.660 --> 37:47.629
She's just pretending
to be stable.

37:47.660 --> 37:49.594
That's why she didn't want
anyone to see that file.

37:49.630 --> 37:52.292
She was in Radley
the same time as Charles.

37:52.330 --> 37:53.729
You're telling me
that Lesli never even--

37:53.770 --> 37:54.589
I asked her myself.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.938
She'd only heard
Charles' name once.

37:56.970 --> 38:00.531
The night that Bethany snuck out
of Radley and never came back.

38:00.570 --> 38:01.798
Charles snuck out
that night too.

38:01.840 --> 38:05.048
Wait. That was the night
that Alison disappeared.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.502
Charles was already
dead by then.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.669
They were looking
for two patients.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.039
The entire place
went on lockdown

38:11.080 --> 38:12.479
'because of Bethany
and Charles.‘

38:12.520 --> 38:15.318
He had to be dead, Mona.
He donated his organs.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.510
Show her, Spencer.

38:19.960 --> 38:21.655
Look.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.053
(Aria)
'Spencer, why did you
just give her those?‘

38:23.100 --> 38:24.624
Don't worry, I made copies.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.319
This donation form's a sham.

38:26.370 --> 38:27.564
Look at the medications
Charles was taking.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.931
Nobody would want his liver.

38:28.970 --> 38:30.631
He's not an eligible donor.

38:30.670 --> 38:33.468
- So what are you saying?
- What, that Charles is alive?

38:33.510 --> 38:35.671
Of course, and probably
planning something big

38:35.710 --> 38:37.678
and wanted
to keep us distracted.

38:37.710 --> 38:40.440
- Lesli's just easy pickings.
- We have a picture.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.072
And the person in the hoodie
is not a guy.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.076
Spencer, if you caught A
in a photo

38:44.120 --> 38:45.917
it's because A wanted
to be caught.

38:45.950 --> 38:47.884
[indistinct radio chatter]

38:48.920 --> 38:51.855
[dramatic music]

39:07.410 --> 39:08.536
[squeaking]

39:09.680 --> 39:13.571
He was a patient there,
how could no one know this?

39:13.610 --> 39:17.614
Yeah.. Uh, yeah..
Thank you...for your time.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.713
[instrumental music]

39:29.830 --> 39:32.094
(Emily)
'Charles chipped all of us.'

39:32.130 --> 39:35.361
That's why it hurts
when you press on it.

39:37.740 --> 39:39.139
And you think the person
who did this to us

39:39.170 --> 39:41.161
the person who's
after us is Charles?

39:41.210 --> 39:42.575
The dead Charles?

39:42.610 --> 39:44.498
He never was and I knew it.

39:44.550 --> 39:45.539
'He tried to make us
believe he was dead'

39:45.580 --> 39:46.899
'because he had to.'

39:46.950 --> 39:49.009
I mean, the only reason
he gave his name up was because

39:49.050 --> 39:52.019
he thought we'd never
get out of that hellhole.

39:52.050 --> 39:53.688
Okay, so what was Lesli?

39:53.720 --> 39:56.985
A speed bump.
On the way to finding Charles.

39:58.190 --> 39:59.782
But we will.

40:08.070 --> 40:11.562
* Isn't it strange

40:11.610 --> 40:15.171
* That we're falling apart

40:15.210 --> 40:19.476
* From the day that we started

40:21.050 --> 40:23.814
* Isn't it hard

40:23.850 --> 40:28.480
* Knowing these things
are unspoken *

40:28.520 --> 40:32.456
* We're born to be broken

40:33.960 --> 40:37.020
* Isn't it strange

40:37.060 --> 40:41.019
* Knowing we're living
our lives *

40:41.070 --> 40:44.858
* On borrowing time

40:46.970 --> 40:50.599
* Isn't it hard

40:50.640 --> 40:55.441
* Getting through this

40:57.720 --> 41:03.056
* You know it's not easy

41:03.090 --> 41:06.753
* Getting through this

41:07.590 --> 41:10.798
* Through this

41:10.830 --> 41:15.164
* All these things we know

41:15.200 --> 41:20.536
* We can't control

41:23.740 --> 41:28.848
* You know it's not easy

41:28.880 --> 41:31.041
* Getting through this..

41:31.080 --> 41:33.514
Sara, I was just..

41:33.550 --> 41:36.610
* Through this

41:36.660 --> 41:41.188
* All these things we know

41:41.230 --> 41:46.588
* We can't control *
