01:01.372 --> 01:03.391
Hey shut that fucking thing off.

01:04.366 --> 01:05.519
What the hell are you doing?

01:05.589 --> 01:06.574
Your lawn.

01:06.653 --> 01:08.116
So that means, can l crash
in the your house

01:08.176 --> 01:09.498
for an undetermined
amount of time?

01:09.568 --> 01:10.533
- Hmm?
- No.

01:10.603 --> 01:12.850
Ok, but,
l did just mow your lawn.

01:12.920 --> 01:13.975
l didn't ask you to do that.

01:14.054 --> 01:15.844
You will let me
stay in your house

01:15.914 --> 01:17.635
for as long as l choose.

01:17.705 --> 01:18.997
Will you stop that.
No l won't.

01:19.067 --> 01:20.022
What, what are you doing?

01:20.092 --> 01:21.613
Nothing.
Look.

01:21.683 --> 01:23.374
Do you know anything about
wiping the moon

01:23.444 --> 01:25.921
from the face of space at all?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.049
Get the fuck off my lawn.

01:30.247 --> 01:31.440
So where are you from?

01:31.510 --> 01:32.435
lt ain't
about where l'm from.

01:32.505 --> 01:33.589
lt's about where you're going.

01:33.669 --> 01:34.634
Okay, fine.

01:34.694 --> 01:36.911
Let's do a thousand
for the lawn and,

01:36.991 --> 01:39.338
say five thousand for
the edging.

01:39.408 --> 01:40.373
How about three dollars for
everything

01:40.443 --> 01:41.864
and l won't call
the police.

01:41.934 --> 01:44.391
Three sounds good, for now.

01:44.451 --> 01:50.419
But tomorrow, l'll be back-
to rake the mulch,

01:51.693 --> 01:53.512
and then maybe
l could just stay for the night?

01:53.582 --> 01:54.547
Look man.

01:54.607 --> 01:55.830
Don't make me get my gun, ok.

01:55.899 --> 01:57.829
You will not go get your gun.

02:00.018 --> 02:03.031
l'll just be over there,
in the rain.

02:03.171 --> 02:04.752
lf it rains.
No pressure.

02:06.791 --> 02:07.617
Hello.

02:08.582 --> 02:11.098
Yes, this is the man
of the house.

<i>Hang one second,

02:23.224 --> 02:24.835

02:27.968 --> 02:29.151
Meatwad who was that?

02:29.221 --> 02:30.086

02:30.156 --> 02:31.121
Well think.

02:31.180 --> 02:32.075
l can't remember that.

02:32.145 --> 02:33.399
lt was long ago.

02:33.478 --> 02:34.930
That's him again.

02:35.795 --> 02:38.183
- Hello.
- Look out your window.

02:38.252 --> 02:39.903
Hey what are you guys doing

02:39.983 --> 02:41.834
Hey, you need me to come in
there and mow that carpet?

02:41.903 --> 02:43.295
lt's getting pretty shaggy.

02:43.365 --> 02:44.589
Frylock, he's right.

02:44.658 --> 02:47.513
This carpet has not been mowed
since we moved in here.

02:47.583 --> 02:49.363
Nice to meet you,
l'm Meatwad,

02:49.432 --> 02:51.093

Okay, you need to leave now.

03:20.437 --> 03:21.262
No, hear me out.

Didn't they just call?
l think they did.

03:26.046 --> 03:27.399
Ooh, now l remember.

03:27.469 --> 03:28.951
lt was the bank that called.

03:29.030 --> 03:30.114
On the phone.

03:30.194 --> 03:31.945
They sold the house.

03:32.015 --> 03:33.138
On the phone.

03:33.218 --> 03:34.929
Oh, that's horrible.

03:54.126 --> 03:56.234
Hey- it's raining batteries.

03:56.314 --> 03:59.288
Yeah, an alkalaid front is
pushing through.

04:00.929 --> 04:04.212
We're expecting a couple of inches of
concussions on your head.

04:06.639 --> 04:08.589
l'm running out of batteries
here.

04:08.659 --> 04:10.180
What are you doing out there?

04:10.250 --> 04:13.263
Your lawn, but l am out of gas

So where you from?

04:17.690 --> 04:19.668
No, no, no we're not having
conversation here.

04:19.749 --> 04:21.072
Well l'm from Moss Eisely.

04:21.141 --> 04:22.226
Just like in the movie.

04:22.295 --> 04:23.121
- How about that?
- Yeah, l don't care.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.806
Hey, quick question- can you
help me blow up the moon?

04:25.886 --> 04:26.811
No, no l can't.

04:26.881 --> 04:29.994
l'm more of an expert of
exposing the moon.

04:34.211 --> 04:35.604
Get out ya telescope!

04:37.603 --> 04:40.488
See if you can find the one
crater!

04:41.283 --> 04:42.139
Wait a minute.

04:42.209 --> 04:43.362
Hey, no, no, no, it's cool.

04:43.442 --> 04:44.426
No!

04:48.057 --> 04:50.165
Did y'all see that?
Well l did.

04:50.245 --> 04:52.891
Carl showed that tall pink man
his hiney and he grew hair

04:52.971 --> 04:55.885
and fangs and claws and then
went inside

04:55.955 --> 04:58.004
and had a heated
discussion.

04:58.073 --> 04:59.038
Yeah.

04:59.108 --> 05:00.401
We're not gonna get involved
with that.

05:00.471 --> 05:02.221
He's a werewolf, Fryman.

05:02.290 --> 05:05.245
He saw Carl's full moon and it
changed him.

05:05.314 --> 05:07.493
Shake, there are no such
things as werewolves, ok.

05:07.573 --> 05:10.078
l know someone who would beg
to differ, Fryman.

05:10.158 --> 05:12.904
And l think you both know who
l'm talking about.

05:12.983 --> 05:13.998
Don't say Kate Beckinsale.

05:14.078 --> 05:15.499
But she was in that movie!

05:15.569 --> 05:16.892
Fake, fake, fake, Shake!

05:16.962 --> 05:18.782
You are going to sit here and
tell me that the Lycan

05:18.852 --> 05:22.293
have not been waging war against
the vampires for centuries--

05:22.373 --> 05:23.925
Hollywood, Shake.

05:23.994 --> 05:25.018
But that suit she wore?

05:25.088 --> 05:26.809
Yeah she looked hot what
about it?

05:26.889 --> 05:29.336
You do know that l own
the cardboard standee.

05:29.405 --> 05:30.768
Yeah, l know.

05:30.837 --> 05:32.916
That means l like that movie.

05:32.996 --> 05:33.881
l know.

05:33.951 --> 05:35.244
Okay.

05:35.314 --> 05:37.631
Just that we're clear now.

05:37.701 --> 05:39.024
Meeting is adjourned.

05:39.104 --> 05:39.988
Good job.

05:40.058 --> 05:41.113
What do we do now?

05:41.192 --> 05:43.440
Oh we wait until you lose
interest, forget all about it,

05:43.510 --> 05:44.773
and then fall asleep.

05:44.843 --> 05:45.827
Alrighty.

06:03.165 --> 06:04.776
l ain't lost interest.

06:04.855 --> 06:05.940
Yeah.

06:06.019 --> 06:08.834
You haven't slept yet either,
Meatwad.

06:08.904 --> 06:11.479
Are you or are you not
Kate Beckinsale?

06:11.559 --> 06:15.469
Well describe your body,
in leather?

06:15.538 --> 06:17.428
Well, l heard you had a winter
home here.

06:17.498 --> 06:19.885
Ask if she got a port in her
chest to drink fluids.

06:19.954 --> 06:22.203
Do you have a port in your
chest to drink fluids?

06:22.282 --> 06:23.704
Plasmas and such.

06:23.774 --> 06:25.027
Yeah plasmas and such.

06:25.266 --> 06:26.519
Hello?

06:26.589 --> 06:27.554
Hey?

06:27.624 --> 06:28.638
l lost her.

06:28.718 --> 06:30.399
She must have gone through a
tunnel.

06:30.478 --> 06:32.557
You know cell reception
is not good.

06:32.636 --> 06:33.919
ln the Underworld.

06:35.124 --> 06:36.705
Who wants strawberry
pancakes?

06:36.784 --> 06:38.067
Me! Me! Me!

06:38.137 --> 06:39.400
l want them, l need them more.

06:39.470 --> 06:41.021
Who has
strawberry pancake mix?

06:41.091 --> 06:42.712
Hell no!
What are you doing here?

06:42.792 --> 06:44.333
l thought we were going to
destroy the moon?

06:44.413 --> 06:47.666
We had that discussion,
that agreement.

06:47.735 --> 06:49.516
Fine.
You want the moon gone?

06:49.596 --> 06:50.988
l'll do it, but l want it in writing,

06:51.048 --> 06:53.704
you'll get the fuck
outta here and never come back.

06:53.774 --> 06:55.136
But Frylock--

06:55.205 --> 06:57.125
your going to eliminate
the tides!

06:57.195 --> 06:59.543
And there goes my surfing career!

06:59.611 --> 07:02.089
Come on, man.

07:02.168 --> 07:04.486
Hang ten and stuff.

07:04.556 --> 07:06.485
- Well, he's right.
- He's right.

07:06.555 --> 07:07.878
Alright, alright yes!

07:07.947 --> 07:10.125
For once, for once he is right!

07:10.205 --> 07:13.020
Okay, l'm going to go catch
some waves.

07:18.869 --> 07:19.952
This is great.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.778
As long as l don't see the moon,
out of sight, out of mind.

07:22.847 --> 07:24.469
Yep, you ready Shake?

07:24.538 --> 07:26.468
l can't get the twist.

07:28.258 --> 07:29.413
Close enough.

07:29.481 --> 07:31.202
Now you make sure you aim
for his heart.

07:31.272 --> 07:32.755
l had to melt down my
grandmomma's fillings

07:32.833 --> 07:33.699
to make those damn bullets.

07:33.769 --> 07:35.052
Are you guys talking over
there?

07:35.132 --> 07:36.315
Wow, my other senses are

07:36.385 --> 07:38.812
compensating for my loss of
sight like crazy.

07:38.882 --> 07:40.165
lt's go time!

07:44.421 --> 07:50.052
Ahhhhhhh!

07:53.284 --> 07:54.865
This is who l am.

07:54.945 --> 07:56.656
Hey who's popping
firecrackers?

07:56.736 --> 07:57.720
Can l do some?

07:57.790 --> 07:58.885
Hey!
What-- no.

08:01.242 --> 08:03.898
Dang, that is stone cold.

08:03.967 --> 08:05.290
Come on y'all.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.345
lt's over.

08:11.238 --> 08:14.153
How much for three
silver bullets?

08:14.222 --> 08:15.446
Take your time.

08:15.516 --> 08:17.942
l know the number will be
very large.

08:18.002 --> 08:21.652
The number will be very large.

08:21.722 --> 08:23.084
These are, these are BBs.

08:23.154 --> 08:24.735
These are not BBs.

08:24.815 --> 08:27.660
<i>These are</i>

08:27.730 --> 08:28.695
Silver BBs.

08:28.764 --> 08:30.416
Regular BBs.

08:30.484 --> 08:33.866
Oh, well how much would you
take for this bass amp?

08:33.936 --> 08:37.080
Well, looks like you're in a
tough spot, werewolf.

08:37.159 --> 08:38.909
Or should l say... Wookiee!

08:38.979 --> 08:39.804
Wookiee!

08:39.875 --> 08:41.764
Gggggggggggggg!

08:41.833 --> 08:43.625
ls he out of his mind.

08:43.693 --> 08:45.743
l've never been a Wookiee
in my life.

08:45.822 --> 08:47.673
l'm a werewolf, you know that.

08:47.743 --> 08:48.866
You saw me change.

08:48.936 --> 08:50.329
Did you change?

08:50.398 --> 08:53.084
Wookiees are all pink when they're
shaved, like an udder.

08:53.154 --> 08:57.003
So l shave all the time,
so what?

08:57.072 --> 09:01.210
Come on, l wanted to blow up the
moon with you guys, remember?

09:01.280 --> 09:03.140
Yeah, you made quite a big
deal about the moon,

09:03.210 --> 09:04.334
didn't you Drew?

09:04.403 --> 09:05.269
Drew Bacca.

09:05.338 --> 09:06.522
Gggggggggg!

09:06.591 --> 09:08.521
You play bass in
a Star Trek tribute band.

09:08.591 --> 09:09.417
Tribble Tunez.

09:09.485 --> 09:11.376
We have cassettes for 8 dollars
if you're interested.

09:48.079 --> 09:49.442
Where in the hell did you get
a light-

09:49.511 --> 09:50.993
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Waver--

09:51.063 --> 09:52.216
Light waver.

09:52.296 --> 09:54.305
Very different from what
you are about to say.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.347
Okay, not in the store,

10:01.726 --> 10:03.268
- Beam me up!
- Beam me up!

10:05.077 --> 10:06.968
l never thought about it
before.

10:07.028 --> 10:10.450
But werewolves, wookiees,

10:10.518 --> 10:12.299
there are some damn key
similarities

10:12.379 --> 10:13.533
between those two.

10:13.602 --> 10:16.179
l was gonna say, though,
he is pretty tall for a Lycan.

10:16.258 --> 10:17.810
You've been reading
the handbook l see.

10:17.890 --> 10:19.341
Good job.

10:19.581 --> 10:21.500

10:21.798 --> 10:23.191
Well, gosh darn it.

10:23.261 --> 10:24.275
The moon blew up.

10:24.355 --> 10:25.777
Damn it did you do that?

10:25.846 --> 10:26.871
No, sir.

10:26.941 --> 10:28.303
That's right you didn't.

10:28.373 --> 10:32.790
Because l did it ya'll,
for Kate.

10:32.850 --> 10:36.002
And our love is meant to be.

10:36.072 --> 10:38.619
Why doesn't she understand this?

10:38.697 --> 10:39.782
No l did that.

10:39.852 --> 10:41.971
l was tired of that fucking
thing.

10:42.845 --> 10:47.083
Okay, no l didn't l just wanted
someone to pay attention to me.

10:48.853 --> 10:50.246

10:56.811 --> 10:58.004
Holy fuck that was cool!

10:58.074 --> 11:01.356
That bullfrog adamantly
disagreed with our microwave.

11:01.426 --> 11:03.743
That was no bullfrog dude,
that was Yoda!

11:03.813 --> 11:06.827
He was like, no, no,
no, turn it on not,

11:06.906 --> 11:07.801

11:07.871 --> 11:09.950
Small and green he was.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.357
Make that mistake anyone can.
