him is they need water for their crops.

there were other artesian wells, right?

- Why's that?

18:21.392 --> 18:24.099
Well, back in the day,
when Ollie's family first dug their well,

18:24.270 --> 18:26.261
it siphoned Off the water
from all the other ones.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.521
There also used to be a small reservoir
in town

18:28.691 --> 18:32.354
before the tower was built,
but Ollie's well sapped that too.

18:32.778 --> 18:36.441
Okay, 80 say we destroy Ollie'S well.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.948
And divert the water back
to the dry ones and the reservoir.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.780

cornering the market on H20.

The only Obstacle is Ollie.
