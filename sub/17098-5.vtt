-Are you sure?

07:18.667 --> 07:20.417
-Shannon,

07:20.458 --> 07:22.834
I appreciate your concern,

07:20.458 --> 07:22.834
but with all due respect

07:22.875 --> 07:24.625
it's a complicated history.

07:25.542 --> 07:27.959
You mean when you were 16

07:25.542 --> 07:27.959
and you stole money,

07:28.000 --> 07:29.291
and you fought

07:28.000 --> 07:29.291
with your father,

07:29.333 --> 07:31.542
and you've never been back

07:29.333 --> 07:31.542
to the store since?

07:32.417 --> 07:34.333
Oh, I think you mentioned it

07:32.417 --> 07:34.333
at one point.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.333
And I may have talked

07:34.375 --> 07:36.333
to Kimchee about it.

07:36.375 --> 07:38.333
Anyway. I really think

07:36.375 --> 07:38.333
you should answer it.

07:43.792 --> 07:44.792

07:49.792 --> 07:52.083
Oh, Illyanka, you have

07:49.792 --> 07:52.083
such beautiful hair.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.083
Thank you.

07:53.125 --> 07:55.333
Yeah, I

07:53.125 --> 07:55.333
always wonder,

07:55.375 --> 07:57.750
does a hairdresser

07:55.375 --> 07:57.750
cut their own hair?

07:57.792 --> 07:59.750
No, Natalia

07:57.792 --> 07:59.750
does it for me.

07:59.792 --> 08:03.583
You know, when my husband

07:59.792 --> 08:03.583
say he want haircut,

08:03.625 --> 08:05.875
the barber say,

08:03.625 --> 08:05.875
"Which one?"

08:06.792 --> 08:07.834
(LAUGHTER)

08:09.917 --> 08:12.583
Sorry, Mrs. Kim doing

08:09.917 --> 08:12.583
so much talking.

08:12.625 --> 08:15.000
She not go out

08:12.625 --> 08:15.000
in long time.

08:15.041 --> 08:17.583
Well, if she go home with

08:15.041 --> 08:17.583
Illyanka, instead of me,

08:17.625 --> 08:19.875
you never be my

wingman ever again.

08:23.083 --> 08:24.458
So...

08:24.500 --> 08:26.000
This is very nice fabric.

08:26.417 --> 08:28.125
I bet you it's

08:26.417 --> 08:28.125
made in China.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.542
Don't take bet.

08:29.583 --> 08:32.959
Nowadays, the only thing

08:29.583 --> 08:32.959
not made in China is baby.

08:33.834 --> 08:35.166
No, that's not true.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.750
Baby is made in va-China.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.875
It's funny. I had no idea

08:41.875 --> 08:43.875
Koreans were so funny.

08:43.917 --> 08:46.208
I had no idea vodka

08:43.917 --> 08:46.208
was so delicious.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.250
-To vodka!

08:46.500 --> 08:48.250
-Vodka!

08:49.375 --> 08:50.458
Come, Mr. Chin!

08:50.500 --> 08:51.917
It's a good time.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.875
Tell you what, we let

08:52.500 --> 08:55.875
you buy us all dinner.

Yeah, sorry.

09:10.625 --> 09:13.000

09:19.667 --> 09:21.125

09:36.542 --> 09:37.959
but harder.

09:39.792 --> 09:40.917
Hey...

09:41.166 --> 09:42.750
Remember when you got

09:41.166 --> 09:42.750
stuck in the cooler?

09:42.792 --> 09:44.875
I remember when

09:42.792 --> 09:44.875
you locked me in it.

09:44.917 --> 09:45.959
Is that how you

09:44.917 --> 09:45.959
remember it?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.166
That's how

09:46.000 --> 09:47.166
it happened.

09:47.208 --> 09:49.750
Nah, we had that game,

09:47.208 --> 09:49.750
from the show.

The...

09:51.792 --> 09:52.917

Right, and you

09:52.959 --> 09:54.208
really believed...

Oh, God, what was

09:54.250 --> 09:56.667
that yogurt drink

09:56.709 --> 09:57.875

09:56.709 --> 09:57.875

Hold up...

10:01.166 --> 10:02.709
Is "<i> yogeoteu</i> " just the

10:01.166 --> 10:02.709
Korean pronunciation of

10:01.166 --> 10:02.709
yogurt?

Oh. It's like you're

10:02.750 --> 10:04.500
getting smarter.

10:04.542 --> 10:06.291
You're the one who thought

10:04.542 --> 10:06.291
it gave you super powers.

10:06.333 --> 10:07.834
I was four.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.667
Still you believed it.

10:09.917 --> 10:11.875
And you told me to stick you

10:09.917 --> 10:11.875
in the cooler

10:11.917 --> 10:13.000
and you'd escape.

10:11.917 --> 10:13.000
So I did.

10:13.041 --> 10:14.667
Then you

10:13.041 --> 10:14.667
forgot I was in there.

10:16.458 --> 10:17.667
I didn't forget.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.500
What?

10:20.875 --> 10:22.750

in the cooler
