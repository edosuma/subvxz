00:02.085 --> 00:05.213
Previously on 90210:
I've got ten songs in here
that are gonna be huge hits.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.466
ADRIANNA:
I can't believe Javier's dead.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.259
I have a lot of new material.

00:09.301 --> 00:10.260
ADRIANNA:
Stuff that no one's heard.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.054
Do you know how
humiliating that is?

00:13.096 --> 00:14.932
Ivy, wait--
No! Just...will you
just stay away from me?

00:14.974 --> 00:16.350
CANNON:
Who's gonna believe you?

00:16.391 --> 00:18.727
You're the girl
who cried wolf.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.855
(muffled screaming)

00:20.896 --> 00:23.941
I accused this guy
of sexual harassment.

00:23.983 --> 00:25.024
And I made it up.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.401
Which is another reason why

00:26.443 --> 00:27.903
I didn't feel like
I could come forward.

00:27.945 --> 00:30.531
It's not a big deal.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.240
Cannon did not
reject me!
What?

00:32.281 --> 00:33.659
He raped me!
He what?

00:33.701 --> 00:36.036
I'm telling you now because
you have to stay away from him.

00:36.077 --> 00:39.623
You've done some really low
stuff before, but this...

00:45.629 --> 00:47.506
(sighs)

00:48.883 --> 00:50.425
NARRATOR:
The animal kingdom is brutal,

00:50.467 --> 00:53.846
but no animal is as
brutal as the Homo sapien.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.769
(screams echoing)

01:05.983 --> 01:10.029
(muffled screaming)

01:20.831 --> 01:22.499
HARPER: So, just look
straight into the camera,

01:22.541 --> 01:24.710
and tell me where you
see yourself in ten years.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.295
ANNIE: Uh, Harper?
The lens cap's still on.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.130
HARPER:
Oops. Brain fart.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.508
Silver, when you edit,
make sure that goes
on the blooper reel.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.764
What's funny?
Nothing.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.474
Make all the fun you want,

01:39.516 --> 01:41.977
but in ten years, when we
play this at the class reunion,

01:42.019 --> 01:44.312
everyone's going to be
thanking me. Well...

01:44.354 --> 01:47.148
if they can get past
my Secret Service detail.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.360
HARPER: Okay, let's
take it from the top.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.529
Annie Wilson, where
do you see yourself in...

01:52.571 --> 01:53.614
Ten years?

01:53.655 --> 01:55.532
Well, I definitely
hope to be acting.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.325
But in the theater,
not in movies.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.662
And when I'm 28, I will be
the perfect age to play...

02:00.704 --> 02:02.163
...music.

02:02.205 --> 02:05.208
I'll be a big-time producer
with a closet full of sneakers,

02:05.250 --> 02:07.753
'cause I'll never wear
the same pair twice.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.672
Maybe even start my own record
label, you know, breaking new--

02:10.714 --> 02:12.758
--York. Manhattan, of course.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.552
Serious journalists don't
live in the outer boroughs.

02:15.594 --> 02:18.722
Unless I'm covering the
Middle East, then I'll be in--

02:18.764 --> 02:20.641
Maui... Or Bali...

02:20.682 --> 02:22.517
or, I don't know, Costa Rica.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.645
Just somewhere
enjoying life, hanging ten...

02:24.686 --> 02:28.523
--years? I don't even know where
I'm gonna be ten days from now.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.525
This is really--
Charming!

02:30.567 --> 02:32.527
You Americans are so nostalgic.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.572
Well, let's see-- I imagine
I'll have moved back to the--

02:35.614 --> 02:39.284
--East Side. A new take
on West Side Story,

02:39.326 --> 02:41.787
only this time,
Maria will be Mario.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.999
Choreographed by yours truly,
of course, and I'm--

02:45.040 --> 02:46.374
--a doctor.
--a lawyer.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.836
--a movie star.
--married to a movie star,

02:48.877 --> 02:50.545
who's already won four--

02:50.587 --> 02:52.547
--Oscar's Pub.
Right in the heart of London.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.173
And you can go there if--

02:54.215 --> 02:55.884
--for some reason
I am not there tonight,

02:55.926 --> 02:57.552
I just want to say one thing.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.764
Hey Teddy: how did
you get so fat, and--

03:00.806 --> 03:02.766
--happy. Very happy.

03:02.808 --> 03:05.435
And I hope that what they say is
true, that with age comes--

03:05.477 --> 03:07.228
--my first Pulitzer prize.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.314
Okay. Peace out.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.315
And...cut.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.817
Super, Silver,
just super!

03:11.859 --> 03:14.277
Now, we still have a bunch of
people who haven't done theirs,

03:14.319 --> 03:16.571
but if you edit these
and get them back to me,

03:16.613 --> 03:18.406
end of day tomorrow,
well, that would be just--

03:18.448 --> 03:19.407
Super?

03:19.449 --> 03:21.451
Exactly!
Thankie, thankie!

03:29.584 --> 03:30.794
Naomi! Great. Sit down.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.715
Ready to be recorded
for posterity?

03:34.756 --> 03:36.758
I'm ready for you to quit
bugging me about it.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.468
In ten years, we'll see
who the queen bee is.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.762
What?
Nothing.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.263
I'm just glad I'm
not the kind of girl

03:42.305 --> 03:43.807
who's going to peak
in high school.

03:43.849 --> 03:46.810
You look... tired.
You wanna do some touchups?

03:46.852 --> 03:48.896
You've got some pretty big
Kate Spades under your eyes.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.605
I'm fine, let's just
get this over with.

03:56.695 --> 03:59.322
IVY:
Dude! Geez.

03:59.364 --> 04:02.159
I had a good time talking
to you the other night.

04:02.201 --> 04:04.327
Yeah.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.412
I should get to class.

04:05.453 --> 04:06.413
No, wait, wait, wait.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.207
I need you to
repeat after me:

04:08.248 --> 04:10.000
Oscar, you are the
greatest human being

04:10.042 --> 04:11.251
on the face of the planet,

04:11.292 --> 04:12.669
and I am eternally
in your debt.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.922
Yeah, see, I don't
think I'd say that

04:14.963 --> 04:16.630
even if you were about
to give me a kidney.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.134
Oh. But this is better
than a kidney, Gidget.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.635
You see, I have two tickets

04:20.677 --> 04:22.804
to the Surfrider Foundation
Benefit at Kelly Slater's house.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.639
Shut up.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.850
Oscar, you are the
greatest human being

04:26.892 --> 04:29.186
on the face of the planet, and
I am eternally in your debt.

04:29.228 --> 04:31.563
Oscar, you don't
completely suck.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.814
When is it?

04:32.856 --> 04:34.149
Tomorrow night.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.276
No... Ugh.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.485
I have plans with
Dixon tomorrow,

04:37.527 --> 04:39.487
and he would
so not be psyched

04:39.529 --> 04:41.698
if I tried to cancel to hang
out with you and Kelly Slater.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.658
Oh, so, you two have
patched things up, then.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.660
Not quite, but...

04:45.702 --> 04:48.538
Yeah, I agreed to a "show me
how much you can grovel" dinner.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.331
How generous of you.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.833
Well, Dixon's like
this puppy, you know,

04:51.875 --> 04:55.336
even when he pees on the couch
you can't really stay mad at him

04:55.378 --> 04:57.505
'cause he didn't
mean to do it.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.174
How charming.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.550
Whatever.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.052
Just don't tell
him I said that,

05:02.094 --> 05:03.971
'cause he's got a lot
of groveling to do.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.055
Far be it from me

05:05.097 --> 05:06.848
to interfere in
your relationship.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.399
Hey.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.859
Hi.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.570
So I stocked all the
actors' dressing rooms,

05:20.612 --> 05:22.823
they're all set
for the run-through.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.407
And double-checked
the quick change list,

05:24.449 --> 05:26.534
and cleaned the grime
out of the coffee maker

05:26.576 --> 05:28.703
so that no one
calls the EPA on us.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.539
(laughs) You're an
amazing find, Annie.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.707
Thanks.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.501
Coming down here on your
lunch hour to pitch in--

05:34.542 --> 05:35.836
well, that is
above and beyond.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.212
Are you kidding me?

05:37.254 --> 05:39.380
The other day, I got to
toast a bagel for David Mamet.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.381
I love it here.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.176
Oh, and we
love having you.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.511
And you have
such a great smile.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.721
Oh, thanks.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.140
No, you do, I mean it.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.224
It's the very first thing
I noticed

05:49.266 --> 05:50.600
when you walked in
for your interview.

05:50.642 --> 05:53.187
Well, I wasn't exactly
smiling too much that day.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.771
I went on that crazy rant.

05:54.813 --> 05:58.275
You were perfect.
Just... perfect.

05:58.317 --> 06:00.735
(nervous laugh)
Well... well, thank you.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.905
Of course.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.615
So, do you
want some lunch?

06:05.657 --> 06:07.242
I can run out
and pick that up.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.618
You don't diet,
do you?

06:08.660 --> 06:10.245
Hmm?

06:10.287 --> 06:11.496
No, I'm-I'm so jealous.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.248
You seem to be able to eat

06:13.290 --> 06:14.666
whatever you want
whenever you want,

06:14.708 --> 06:16.417
and you have such
a terrific figure.

06:16.459 --> 06:21.048
Oh, uh, uh, no, I--
I've never been a big dieter.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.258
Right. Just good
genes, huh?

06:23.300 --> 06:25.426
That's what I thought.

06:25.468 --> 06:29.556
Well, uh, I-I-I should
probably get back to school.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.099
Okay.
So I'll see you later.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.434
I look forward to it.
(laughs)

06:36.146 --> 06:39.191
Hey, I don't care how many
gold records the guy has.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.484
He's not getting
his own trailer.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.820
This is a memorial
service, not Bonnaroo.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.530
Yeah.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.742
These people, I swear.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.618
Bunch of prima donnas.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.495
You're the only person who's
performing at this thing

06:52.537 --> 06:54.081
who hasn't requested
caviar and champagne.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.291
Okay, the thing is, Laurel...

06:56.333 --> 06:58.293
I don't want to sing
at the memorial.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.837
What? Why not?

07:00.879 --> 07:03.422
I just... um, I mean,

07:03.464 --> 07:04.799
we weren't that close,

07:04.841 --> 07:07.094
and I'm sure there were
a lot of other people

07:07.135 --> 07:08.262
that were closer to him.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.346
He was crazy about you.

07:09.388 --> 07:11.056
Yeah, but...

07:11.098 --> 07:14.393
And that song you wrote,
it's perfect.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.353
I mean, when
I first heard it,

07:16.395 --> 07:21.275
I swear I could hear Javier in
the verses, in the arrangement.

07:21.316 --> 07:22.817
He obviously
influenced you musically.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.946
Yeah. He did.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.323
Which is why it's the
perfect song to sing.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.326
Uh, I can't, I can't...

07:31.368 --> 07:33.036
But why?

07:33.078 --> 07:35.663
It's just...

07:35.705 --> 07:36.748
It's too painful.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.295
(sighing):
Oh, babe...

07:41.336 --> 07:43.671
I get it.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.342
But it's really
important that you do this,

07:47.384 --> 07:51.888
not just to me, but...
to Javier's family.

07:51.930 --> 07:56.435
I mean... you were the last
person to see him alive.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.022
Hey, you can do this.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.107
I promise.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.073
Hey, Mr. Cannon.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.408
Hi. (laughs)

08:11.450 --> 08:13.201
I just got a new toy.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.702
Amazing resolution,
LCD touchscreen,

08:14.744 --> 08:16.704
all mag backlight sensor...

08:16.746 --> 08:18.039
Am I drooling?

08:18.081 --> 08:19.040
A little bit.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.208
Right.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.085
You should come by after
school and check it out.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.045
I wish, but I can't today.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.546
I still have about
100 more testimonials

08:25.588 --> 08:27.048
I promised
Harper I'd edit.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.633
Ah.
DIXON:
Whassup, Silver?

08:28.675 --> 08:29.634
Hey.
Hey, um...

08:29.676 --> 08:30.885
Do you know where Teddy is?

08:30.927 --> 08:32.386
Don't know, don't care.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.388
(locker slams)

08:33.429 --> 08:34.597
Gotcha.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.351
(sighs)

08:37.392 --> 08:38.893
So, can I have
a rain check?

08:38.934 --> 08:40.020
Anytime.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.229
Awesome.

08:53.658 --> 08:54.909
(groans)

09:00.623 --> 09:02.834
(groans)

09:15.972 --> 09:17.932
(vomiting, coughing)

09:37.160 --> 09:40.997
Javier was so many things to me:
Nephew...

09:41.039 --> 09:42.916
client...

09:42.957 --> 09:45.377
friend.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.254
He died too young.

09:47.295 --> 09:53.385
But man... his music
will live on forever.

09:53.427 --> 09:54.928
And as God is my witness,

09:54.969 --> 09:58.223
I will devote
the rest of my life

09:58.265 --> 10:00.975
to preserving that kid's legacy.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.903
And now it's my very special
honor to introduce to you

10:11.945 --> 10:15.407
his close friend
and collaborator

10:15.449 --> 10:16.657
Adrianna Tate-Duncan.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.455
LAUREL:
Sweetie?

10:23.664 --> 10:26.667
You can do it.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.587
You know what?
You're right.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.547

18:09.589 --> 18:11.883

18:26.105 --> 18:27.565

18:27.607 --> 18:30.693
I'm just really tired.

18:30.735 --> 18:31.778

18:31.819 --> 18:32.904
Your nose looks great.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.321
Thanks.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.449
You know, I wanted Eva Longoria,

18:36.490 --> 18:39.077
but sometimes I think
it's a little too Eva Mendes.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.912
It's nice.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.204
Somewhere between

18:42.246 --> 18:43.456
the two Evas.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.958
Hey, do you
want some of these?

18:44.999 --> 18:47.418

I got the schnozz remodeled .

18:47.460 --> 18:49.420

little bit early?

Charlie for lunch.
Oh.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.611
Uh... uh... okay.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.280
Yeah, I mean, well,
he's not my official boyfriend.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.616
We're not exclusive or anything,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.076
but he's definitely
boyfriend material.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.869
Yeah, he's so cool and cute,

19:21.911 --> 19:24.622
and I like him a lot more
than my last boyfriend.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.582
Way, way more
than the two before that.

19:26.624 --> 19:29.085
Oh, gosh, I must sound
boy crazy to you, huh?

19:29.127 --> 19:30.920
I mean, I guess
I am a little bit.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.088
Okay, a lot. A lot.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.464

I love boys.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.966
Seriously, since I was little.

Well, that's-that's

Oh, hi.

Mmm!

19:44.684 --> 19:46.019
Not at all.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.269
This is Annie.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.729
Annie, this is
my husband Peter.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.690

19:55.402 --> 19:56.696
(laughs)

19:56.737 --> 19:58.238
Wow. Sorry.
It's just you're...

19:58.280 --> 19:59.824
even prettier
than Katherine described.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.034
Uh, Peter...

20:01.075 --> 20:03.703
PETER: No. I mean,
it's just, you look a lot

20:03.744 --> 20:05.121
like my beautiful wife did.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.373
Oh, right, like,
20 years ago.
Mm-hmm.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.083
Well, thanks.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.250
It's true.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.755
Okay, well, uh,
I-I am gonna head out,

20:14.797 --> 20:16.090
like I said I was,

20:16.132 --> 20:17.758
and it was very nice
meeting you, Peter.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.177
Oh, wait, wait, wait,
before you go.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.261
We're having a little barbecue
at the house on Saturday.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.763
Yes, and we would love it
if you would come.

20:22.805 --> 20:23.931
It'll be fun.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.725
We'll cook,
go swimming.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.685
Oh, well, I don't swim.
I Jacuzzi.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.687
(both laugh)

20:29.729 --> 20:31.564
Please, try and join us.

20:31.605 --> 20:32.857
Okay.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.526
(laughs)
I will try.

20:38.529 --> 20:40.406
(sighs)

20:46.787 --> 20:49.248
T-minus

20:49.289 --> 20:51.584
six hours until
Grovel Fest 2010?

20:51.625 --> 20:54.587
But give me a hint: Are we
going to Japanese, Italian...?

20:54.628 --> 20:56.172
Can I wear
flip-flops?

20:56.214 --> 20:57.464
Are you a virgin?

21:00.218 --> 21:03.012
Um...
Well, are you?

21:03.054 --> 21:05.014
Well, where is that
even coming from...?

21:05.056 --> 21:06.306
Just answer the question.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.392
Did you lose your virginity

21:08.434 --> 21:10.686
at surf camp
when you were 15?

21:10.728 --> 21:11.896
(sighs)

21:11.938 --> 21:13.231
Wow. Okay.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.899
You lied.
How did...
How did you...?

21:14.941 --> 21:16.067
Oscar told me.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.610
So, I'm glad

21:17.651 --> 21:19.987
you were able to share it
with him, at least.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.239
I didn't, Dixon.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.116
He-He... He guessed it.

21:23.157 --> 21:25.451
Whatever.
No, it's not
whatever. Come on.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.954
Seriously.
Why would you lie
to me about something like that?

21:27.995 --> 21:29.496
I don't know, okay?

21:29.538 --> 21:30.915
I... I guess it's just...

21:30.957 --> 21:32.208
It's not exactly...

21:32.250 --> 21:33.542
It's not exactly cool.

21:33.584 --> 21:37.463
Being in a relationship
isn't about being cool.

21:37.504 --> 21:39.757
Think about all the stuff
that I told you.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.341
All the stuff about
my parents splitting up,

21:41.383 --> 21:42.676
about my gambling,
about my birth mom.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.428
Look, I know.
And I told you
all of that

21:44.470 --> 21:45.888
because I felt close to you.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.807
Because I trusted you.

21:47.848 --> 21:50.434
Okay, look, yeah,
I made a mistake.

21:50.476 --> 21:53.104
Got it.
But don't be mad at me.

21:53.146 --> 21:55.439
Ivy, it's not about
me being mad.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.276
(sighs)

21:58.317 --> 22:00.194

You clearly haven't heard.

22:40.151 --> 22:41.861
Heard what?

Who cares?

22:57.543 --> 22:59.212
You have over a million hits.

Yeah. You're bigger

23:02.882 --> 23:04.675
The label's already booked
studio time next week

23:04.717 --> 23:06.635

Are you serious?

23:08.846 --> 23:10.014
Oh, it gets better.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.598
You're going to be on
Entertainment Tonight.

Taylor Swift.

(sighs)
Really?

24:17.455 --> 24:19.583
Yeah.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.667
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

24:20.709 --> 24:21.668
Okay...

24:21.710 --> 24:23.003
what do you think
of this outfit?

24:23.045 --> 24:25.505
Mmm. Too Taylor Swift.
So, it turns out,

24:25.547 --> 24:26.924
my boss
is not a lesbian.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.218
I actually met her husband.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.428
How relieved are you?

24:30.468 --> 24:32.388
Not too relieved 'cause

24:32.430 --> 24:34.848
it turns out, he's actually
more into me than she was.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.558
And they invited me
over to their house

24:36.600 --> 24:39.437
to "Jacuzzi."

24:39.477 --> 24:41.063
Oh, my God.
They're swingers?

24:41.105 --> 24:42.315
Well, that's
what I'm thinking.

24:42.356 --> 24:43.732
So what do I do?

24:43.774 --> 24:44.984
Is he cute?

24:45.025 --> 24:46.319
Ew!

24:46.360 --> 24:47.861
Just play dumb.

24:47.903 --> 24:50.488
Maybe it won't
come up again.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.574
Uh, and if it does?
Then nip it in the bud.

24:52.616 --> 24:55.577
Although you
might get fired.

24:55.619 --> 24:56.620
Yeah. Ugh.

24:56.662 --> 24:57.955
It's too bad.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.540
I really like
that internship.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.087
Ow! Stop that!

25:05.129 --> 25:06.130
What is the matter
with you?

25:06.172 --> 25:08.257
What are you doing?
Would you calm down?

25:08.299 --> 25:09.467
Don't tell me
to calm down!

25:09.507 --> 25:10.550
What the hell
is wrong with you?

25:10.592 --> 25:11.551
Well, right now,
I'm recovering

25:11.593 --> 25:13.679
from a rather brutal
magazine attack.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.973
Why did you have to tell Dixon
that I'm a virgin?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.266
That was a secret?

25:18.309 --> 25:19.559
(sighs)

25:19.601 --> 25:21.228
I'm so sorry, Gidget.
Honestly, I thought he knew.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.022
You know what?
He didn't.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.941
I just assumed, since
he's your boyfriend,

25:25.983 --> 25:27.943
that...

25:27.985 --> 25:30.029
Then again, you two
are an odd match.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.155
And what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

25:31.197 --> 25:33.032
Nothing. Forget
I said that.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.909
I'm just... I meant that
since he's your boyfriend,

25:35.951 --> 25:37.828
I assumed you had a
strong relationship.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.246
Yeah, and we do.

25:39.288 --> 25:42.375
Then why wouldn't
you tell him?

25:42.416 --> 25:45.378
Forgive me. There I go,
overstepping again.

25:45.419 --> 25:47.046
The strength of
your relationship

25:47.087 --> 25:48.714
is none of my concern.

25:48.755 --> 25:51.258
Please.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.592
Accept my apology.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.189
(video fast-forwards)

26:05.231 --> 26:07.649
Magnum cum laude,
from Princeton, of course.

26:07.691 --> 26:08.984

26:09.026 --> 26:10.694
GIRL:
...work for the campaign

26:10.736 --> 26:13.072

who will reward...

26:13.113 --> 26:14.323
(fast forwards)

26:14.365 --> 26:17.243
...meet the perfect man--
a doctor in the E.R.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.827
(fast forwards)

26:18.869 --> 26:21.414
HARPER: So, Teddy Montgomery.
Crystal ball.

26:21.455 --> 26:23.416
Where do you see yourself
in ten years?

26:23.457 --> 26:28.128
Silver, hi. This is the only way
I could get you face-to-face.

26:28.170 --> 26:32.883
I am so sorry.
You have to believe me.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.719
Well, you don't have to,
but I hope you do.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.471
Losing tennis,

26:37.513 --> 26:39.890
it's screwing with me, you know?

26:39.932 --> 26:41.975
It's making me do things
that aren't me.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.061
They're not.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.105
Remember when we read that poem
in English class

26:46.146 --> 26:47.565
about the compass and the foot

26:47.647 --> 26:49.858
and-and how the foot
stays in the center

26:49.900 --> 26:53.529
and keeps the compass from going
in the wrong direction?

26:53.571 --> 26:55.448
Well, you're my compass foot.

26:57.408 --> 27:00.827
Wow. That sounded
a lot more romantic in my head.

27:00.869 --> 27:04.622
What I meant--
What I mean is...

27:04.664 --> 27:07.209
I can handle losing tennis.

27:07.251 --> 27:09.086
But I can't lose you.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.088
I can't.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.174
HARPER: That's your testimonial?
Seriously?

27:17.052 --> 27:18.011
(Silver laughs)

27:35.154 --> 27:36.196
Mr. Cannon.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.283
Silver. Hi.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.534
What a coincidence.

27:40.576 --> 27:41.785
How are you?

27:41.827 --> 27:43.870
Not too bad. You?

27:43.912 --> 27:44.871
Fantastic.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.706
Fantastic? Really? Wow.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.792
I just finished
the rough cut of my film.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.836
(laughs)
That is fantastic.

27:50.877 --> 27:52.421
I don't supposed you want
to come see it, do you?

27:52.463 --> 27:53.839
I live not too
far from here.

27:53.880 --> 27:58.135
Um... Sorry. I don't know
what I was thinking.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.304
I just really needed feedback

28:00.346 --> 28:01.805
because the deadline
for the Palm Springs

28:01.847 --> 28:03.681
Film Festival
is in two days.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.434
No, I get it.
And I'd love to see it.

28:05.476 --> 28:06.352
Really?

28:09.355 --> 28:10.730
Fantastic.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.569
Joining us now

28:15.611 --> 28:17.695
is Adrianna Tate-Duncan

28:17.737 --> 28:20.616
whose deeply moving
and heartfelt tribute

28:20.658 --> 28:23.160
to Javier Luna has become
an Internet sensation.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.620
Thanks for being here,
Adrianna.

28:24.662 --> 28:25.663
Thanks for having me.

28:25.703 --> 28:27.373
We've all seen
the performance.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.249
Tell us, what was going
through your mind?

28:29.291 --> 28:30.792
I was just thinking
about Javier.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.587
You know, and how
talented he was,

28:33.629 --> 28:36.173
and what a great friend
and person he was,

28:36.215 --> 28:38.592
and how tragic this
whole thing is.

28:38.634 --> 28:39.885
So the two of you
were close?

28:39.926 --> 28:41.094
Yes, very.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.762
I wrote that song
a while ago,

28:42.804 --> 28:45.015
and when he passed,

28:45.057 --> 28:48.477
it just seemed like the perfect
song to sing in his memory.

28:48.519 --> 28:50.103
Indeed, it was.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.897
Can we coax
an encore from you?

28:51.938 --> 28:53.357
Of course.
(chuckles)

28:53.399 --> 28:54.525

Yeah. I got that while
filming outside Kenya.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.352
Traded a tribal warlord
for a Yankees cap.

I just remembered.

I'm supposed to go and help
Harper open a file I sent her.

34:00.330 --> 34:01.540

34:01.581 --> 34:03.625
Oh, by all means,
give her a call.

34:03.667 --> 34:07.713
Right. Well, I could, but, um,
it's really complicated,

34:07.754 --> 34:11.299
so I should probably
be there to show her, you know.

34:11.341 --> 34:14.092
You want to leave?

34:14.135 --> 34:16.388
No, I don't want to,
but you know Harper.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.139
I mean, she's kind of psycho.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.850
But, um, I'm really bummed

34:19.891 --> 34:21.434

34:33.237 --> 34:36.074
Perfect. So, I'm gonna go back,

Okay.
Okay.

Oh. Really?

35:17.156 --> 35:19.076
Huh.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.411

Um,

35:22.955 --> 35:24.205
could you sit
down for a moment?

I want to talk to you about.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.627
Oh, okay, yeah.

35:28.668 --> 35:31.337
S-Sure.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.511
Oh, this isn't as
intimate as I imagined.

35:38.553 --> 35:43.266
Um, and what I'm about to say
may seem a little inappropriate.

35:43.308 --> 35:46.770
Well, actually, it's
very inappropriate.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.480
(sighs)
The thing is,

35:48.521 --> 35:50.607
Peter and I have
a little proposition.

35:50.649 --> 35:51.984
I'm not a swinger!

35:52.025 --> 35:54.152
What?!

35:54.193 --> 35:56.321
I'm not. I'm sorry. I-I...

35:56.362 --> 35:57.656
I mean, what you do
is your business.

35:57.697 --> 35:58.949
And I won't judge, honestly,

35:58.991 --> 36:00.617
but that's just not me.
I mean...

36:00.659 --> 36:02.995
Wait, that's what you thought
my proposition was?

36:03.036 --> 36:04.663
To... swing?

36:04.704 --> 36:06.331
It's not?

36:06.372 --> 36:07.332
No.

36:07.373 --> 36:10.251
(sighs)
Definitely not.

36:10.293 --> 36:12.420
Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

36:12.462 --> 36:14.422
I mean, I just
thought, because...

36:14.464 --> 36:16.257
No, no, don't
be embarrassed.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.926
I've been acting
a little strange.

36:17.968 --> 36:22.139
And Peter-- God, he was
a mess when he met you.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.431
Yeah, but why?

36:23.473 --> 36:25.475
Because there's a really
important question

36:25.517 --> 36:27.519
that we would like
to ask you.

36:29.479 --> 36:31.857
(sighs)

36:31.898 --> 36:36.194
Peter and I have been trying to
conceive for the past few years.

36:36.235 --> 36:38.780
And recently we were told
we needed to move on

36:38.822 --> 36:40.782
to donor eggs.

36:40.824 --> 36:42.450
And we've been
looking for a match

36:46.329 --> 36:49.791
You... you just seem right.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.793
I'm sorry, what?

36:51.835 --> 36:54.462
We'd like to buy your eggs.

36:54.504 --> 36:57.757
And we're prepared
to pay you $20,000.

where we're going?

37:05.182 --> 37:07.350
'Cause we're here.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.071
I'm still confused.

37:19.112 --> 37:21.740
Look, you're right-- I mean
relationships are about

37:21.781 --> 37:23.992
being vulnerable and crap...

37:24.034 --> 37:25.410
And crap?

37:25.451 --> 37:27.495
Dixon, will you
let me finish?

37:27.537 --> 37:28.538
Okay, I'm trying.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.831
The point was that

37:29.873 --> 37:33.543
obviously, this kind of
stuff is hard for me.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.588
And I've been trying
to figure out why

37:36.629 --> 37:41.009
I haven't totally, you know,
like, opened up to you.

37:41.051 --> 37:45.180
'Cause the relationship
is strong.

37:45.222 --> 37:46.389
I mean, it is.

37:46.431 --> 37:47.933
I just think that

37:47.974 --> 37:50.351
maybe it's because
the last time

37:50.393 --> 37:53.438
I was really vulnerable
with a guy

37:53.479 --> 37:57.525
he kind of, uh, rejected me.
