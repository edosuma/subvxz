WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.370
So I'm in victoria's secret
looking at all the pictures
of the models

00:04.372 --> 00:06.739
And I thought,
"what's with all
the fatties?"

00:06.741 --> 00:09.074
So I've decided

00:09.076 --> 00:10.542
I'm gonna be
a lingerie model.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.711
So you wanna become
a lingerie model

00:12.713 --> 00:14.480
Just to show that
you're skinnier than
those women?

00:14.482 --> 00:17.516
Uh, no.
That would make me
sound bitchy and shallow.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.785
I'm doing this
to get back at my mom.

00:19.787 --> 00:23.055
There have to be other ways
to deal with your mother.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.390
For example,
my ex-wife did it

00:24.392 --> 00:26.792
By marrying a man
that her mother hated.

00:26.794 --> 00:30.462
Anyway, I've decided
to get pictures taken
and start a portfolio.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.765
I already have hundreds
of photos of you.

00:32.767 --> 00:35.067
That's nice, nolan,
but she probably can't use

00:35.069 --> 00:37.770
Blurry photos of herself
shot through bushes.

00:37.772 --> 00:40.706
Actually, photography
happens to be one
of my hobbies.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.541
Here, look.

00:42.543 --> 00:46.045
I downloaded
some of my photos
to my phone.

00:46.047 --> 00:49.081
Blurry through the bushes,
blurry through the bushes,

00:49.083 --> 00:51.050
Blurry through
the bushes,

00:51.052 --> 00:53.452
And France.

00:53.454 --> 00:56.121
Oh, wow.
This is really great.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.589
This woman in the cafÃ©
looks beautiful.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.825
Well, if you think
you can capture

00:59.827 --> 01:02.094
My hotness,
then you've got the job.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.662
If we're done talking
about the world's first

01:03.664 --> 01:06.098
Four-foot-tall
supermodel, I'd like
to talk about me, please.

01:06.100 --> 01:11.336
Last time we talked,
we were pretty deep into some
issues regarding your career.

01:11.338 --> 01:14.273
This guy always has
"quareer" issues.

01:15.608 --> 01:19.111
Oh, I'm not proud of that.
I'm gonna put $10 in.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.081
Well,
the good news is

01:22.083 --> 01:23.682
I don't have
any more career issues

01:23.684 --> 01:26.518
Because I took
your advice and I quit
the department store.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.088
That's huge.
You must feel so liberated.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.757
I do.
I've been liberated
from my paycheck

01:31.759 --> 01:35.360
And pretty soon
I'll be liberated
from living indoors.

01:35.362 --> 01:37.863
I've never been so unhappy
in my entire life.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.765
But, patrick,
you said you were wasting

01:39.767 --> 01:41.500
Your creative talents
as a personal shopper.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.535
But that didn't mean
I had to quit.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.571
Everyone gets frustrated
with their jobs.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.706
I'm already
a little bored
with modeling.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.844
I've never been
out of a job in
my entire life.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.846
I have worked steadily
since I was 15.

01:53.848 --> 01:56.248
- <i>( car pulls up )</i>
<i>- I hear you and I understand,</i>

01:56.250 --> 01:58.250
But we can't go
overtime today.

01:58.252 --> 02:01.120
- Is there a moment this week
that you're free to talk?
- Let me check.

02:01.122 --> 02:03.822
Um... Yeah,
every second.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.891
I can work around that.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.760
Look, guys,

02:08.762 --> 02:12.264
This client coming in
is kind of high profile,

02:12.266 --> 02:14.266
So I trust that you'll extend
the same confidentiality

02:14.268 --> 02:15.767
That you extend
to each other.

02:15.769 --> 02:18.504
Oh, god, let it be
angie dickinson.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.273
It's cee lo green.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.142
Who the hell's
cee lo green?

02:23.144 --> 02:25.644
You see, that's the type
of confidentiality
I'm looking for.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.480
You know, I used
to be all about

02:28.482 --> 02:30.382
Millionaire black
basketball players

02:30.384 --> 02:32.518
Until a millionaire
black singer

02:32.520 --> 02:36.155
- Pulled into your driveway.
- <i>( knocking on door )</i>

02:36.789 --> 02:38.757
Hey, charlie.
I hope I'm not too late.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.260
- No, no.
We're just finishing up.
- Cool.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.828
See you next week,
everybody.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.930
Cee lo: <i>Shawty.</i>

02:44.932 --> 02:50.235
You don't know me yet,
but I'm a lingerie
supermodel.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.404
Call me.
Here's my phone.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.906
You don't wanna
keep that.

02:53.908 --> 02:57.342
She has "find-a-phone."
she'll know where you live.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.545
Bye.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.780
Please,
come on in.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.283
- Thank you.
- It's such a pleasure
to meet you.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.784
You, too.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.853
Listen, charlie,
I'm sorry.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.622
Coming here to therapy
is not gonna work for me.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.691
Well, at least
you gave it a fair shot.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.595
That's not what I mean.
What I mean is...

03:16.597 --> 03:19.631
I want you to be
on call for me 24/7.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.935
You see, I've got this
reputation for being, like,
a nice guy and all of that,

03:22.937 --> 03:25.437
But I'm under a lot
of stress at the moment

03:25.439 --> 03:28.207
And I don't wanna blow up
and ruin my reputation.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.842
Yeah, there's no coming back
from something like that.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.779
I just need you
for a few weeks

03:33.781 --> 03:36.782
While I'm rehearsing
my new show "loberace."

03:36.784 --> 03:39.518
24/7, that's quite
a commitment.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.887
Charlie, come on.
What do I gotta do
to sweeten the deal?

03:41.889 --> 03:44.990
I'm sorry, cee lo.
I wish there was something
that I--

03:45.959 --> 03:47.526
Wait a minute.
There is something.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.795
I have a friend who's
a very talented stylist

03:49.797 --> 03:52.331
Who I just encouraged
to quit his job

03:52.333 --> 03:53.999
And, well,
he needs a new one.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.968
Send him to me.
I'll put him on my team.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.769
Really?
Just like that?

03:57.771 --> 04:00.839
I love to give people breaks,
especially if they can sing,

04:00.841 --> 04:03.475
But everybody thinks
they can sing.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.412
- You got yourself a deal.
- All right.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.880
Okay, one more favor
I need from you.

04:08.882 --> 04:12.818
The girl I met on the way in,
I want her number.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.920
I'm gonna do you
an even bigger favor,

04:14.922 --> 04:17.322
I'm not gonna
give it to you.

04:18.324 --> 04:20.392
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

04:23.830 --> 04:25.497
All right,
before I take off
this robe,

04:25.499 --> 04:27.899
- I'm gonna go over
the rules.
- Rules?

04:27.901 --> 04:30.535
Number one,
you're not allowed
to touch the model.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.704
Is the model's hair
part of the model?

04:32.706 --> 04:34.940
Yes,
and so are the feet.

04:34.942 --> 04:38.410
My god, who made
these rules?

04:38.412 --> 04:40.879
Number two, you're not allowed
to do anything weird,

04:40.881 --> 04:42.781
Like sniffing my couch.

04:42.783 --> 04:46.318
Damn it, they thought
of everything.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.320
Can you abide
by those rules?

04:48.322 --> 04:51.623
- Yes.
- Okay, then.
Let's do this.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.628
( whimpers )

04:57.964 --> 05:00.766
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.901
Right, so...

05:04.037 --> 05:05.971
Mount the couch.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.576
Okay, now relax
a little.

05:12.845 --> 05:14.513
Okay, that's good.

05:14.515 --> 05:17.849
- Be a little flirty.
- ( laughs )

05:17.851 --> 05:21.420
Okay, show me
those eyes.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.523
Yes. Okay, pretend
you're making love to me.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.793
I mean, me. I mean, me.
I mean, the camera.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.331
So how do I look?
Like a supermodel?

05:32.333 --> 05:37.336
I'm just thinking you should
turn the other way so we can
get your good side.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.704
My good side?

05:38.706 --> 05:41.573
No, no, no, no.
Both sides are perfect...

05:41.575 --> 05:43.942
But one side's
not as good.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.812
You know, I always knew
my left side was my bad side.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.114
That's why nobody hits on me
when I'm driving.

05:49.116 --> 05:52.117
I would do so much better
if I lived in England.

05:52.119 --> 05:55.387
- Well, it's true.
- Thanks, nolan.

05:55.389 --> 05:59.124
- Nobody's ever been
honest with me before.
- No problem.

05:59.126 --> 06:02.694
Let me change the lens
so I can get a little
less depth of field.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.905
Could we please not tell
the rules committee?

06:19.479 --> 06:21.613
- How long were you
at that conference?
- Two weeks.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.383
It felt like two years.
Let's do this.

06:25.985 --> 06:29.087
( moans )

06:29.089 --> 06:31.156
That blouse was $400.

06:31.158 --> 06:34.493
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.561
No, that's what
made it hot.
Kiss me.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.832
I don't have to pay you
back for that, do I?

06:40.834 --> 06:44.102
No, don't worry about it.
Just rip off my skirt.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.939
I'm gonna go slow.
This looks a little pricey.

06:49.842 --> 06:52.978
- Rip it off!
- I can't. I'm already
into you for $400.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.880
( sighs )

06:54.882 --> 06:56.415
<i>( cell phone chiming )</i>

06:56.417 --> 06:58.150
You aren't gonna
answer that,
are you?

06:58.152 --> 07:02.187
- I have to.
It's cee lo.
- ( groans )

07:02.189 --> 07:05.791
Hello.
Oh, hey, buddy.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.926
Right now?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.428
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sure, no problem.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.929
I'll see you soon.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.764
I'm sorry, kate.
I gotta go.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.900
I can't believe
you agreed to be
on call.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.668
Once again,

07:16.670 --> 07:19.137
This is you getting
overly involved in your
patients' lives.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.808
Cee lo is a very busy man
and he can't come to me on
a regularly scheduled basis.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.543
So that's why
you're doing this?

07:24.545 --> 07:25.811
Not really.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.979
I'm doing this
so patrick can have a job.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.982
What if I need you?
What if I have an emergency?

07:33.186 --> 07:34.886
You're right.
This is crazy.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.888
I'm gonna call him back
and tell him I can't make it.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.894
Hello?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.763
Yeah, I'm on the freeway.
I'll see you soon.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.035
( huffs )

07:51.504 --> 07:53.171
Dad, pulp or no pulp?

07:53.173 --> 07:56.608
-  <i>Dad!</i>
<i>- What?</i>

07:56.610 --> 07:58.944
I don't know why
you invited us over
for breakfast

07:58.946 --> 08:01.012
If you're gonna be
out on a date all night.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.881
I wasn't on a date.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.650
I was at customs all night
trying to keep cee lo green

08:05.652 --> 08:08.620
From getting upset because
his gold-plated piano

08:08.622 --> 08:10.689
Showed up from monaco
with a scratch.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.257
Okay, if you're just gonna
string together

08:12.259 --> 08:14.759
Random sets of words,
we're going home.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.928
No, no, no, no.
Cee lo's a patient now,
but don't get excited.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.630
<i>He's just a regular guy</i>
<i>like anybody else.</i>

08:18.632 --> 08:20.632
Puts his pants on
one leg at a time.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.834
Yeah, but his pants
are gold lamÃ©

08:22.836 --> 08:24.236
And they cost
a million dollars.

08:26.873 --> 08:28.173
I gotta meet him,
charlie.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.709
Yeah, I know,
but you're never
gonna meet him.

08:30.711 --> 08:34.813
-  <i>( doorbell rings )</i>
<i>- oh, that's different.</i>
<i>You never will.</i>

08:34.815 --> 08:37.949
Okay, cee lo
is at the front door.
What do we do?

08:37.951 --> 08:39.584
Relax, relax, relax.

08:39.586 --> 08:41.553
We answer the door.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.688
I've done it
dozens of times.
It works.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.224
- Right.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:46.226 --> 08:49.294
Before you go.
Remember, as long as
cee lo's in this house,

08:49.296 --> 08:51.263
He's not a celebrity,
he's a patient.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.832
- So I want you
on your best behavior.
- Yeah, charlie, I know.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.934
- I'm a grown woman.
- Oh, come on.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.537
I've seen how crazy you get
when you think you've
spotted a celebrity.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.772
Remember the time
you begged

09:00.774 --> 09:02.908
"willie nelson"
for his autograph?

09:02.910 --> 09:05.844
I'm telling you,
that was willie nelson.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.613
It was a homeless man.

09:08.615 --> 09:11.182
If it was willie nelson,
he wouldn't have asked you
for a dollar.

09:11.184 --> 09:14.119
If you know anything
about willie nelson,

09:14.121 --> 09:16.821
You know he's had
a lot of tax problems.

09:16.823 --> 09:20.225
Yeah, but he doesn't wear
six jackets in the middle
of July.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.961
Just be cool.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.864
Hey, there he is.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.233
- Hey, cee lo. How are you?
- What's up, bro?

09:28.235 --> 09:29.968
Hey,
so this is for you.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.337
A token of my appreciation
for helping me out last night.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.573
- Oh, you shouldn't have,
but thank you.
- No problem.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.207
- I see you've met
my daughter sam.
- I did.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.176
- My ex-wife jennifer.
- Well, it's very nice
to meet you.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.612
- My name is cee lo.
- I know who you are.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.247
And if I met you
on the street

09:42.249 --> 09:45.116
And you were wearing
six jackets and sharing
pizza with a dog,

09:45.118 --> 09:47.786
- I'd still know
it's you.
- Hmm.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.854
Give us a minute,
ladies.

09:52.224 --> 09:54.292
Nice to meet you,
cee lo.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.731
You know, you really
didn't have to do this.

09:59.733 --> 10:02.233
Well, I didn't.
My assistant steve
picked it up.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.169
- Oh, well, then
thank him for me.
- <i>I will.</i>

10:04.171 --> 10:06.605
That will help
soften the blow.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.206
What-- what blow?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.175
Well, I want you to tell him
that he sucks,

10:10.177 --> 10:12.177
That he needs to get
his act together.

10:12.179 --> 10:15.747
- Why can't you do that?
- Because I have an image
to protect.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.850
Can't you see
how adorable I am?

10:18.852 --> 10:22.320
Look, cee lo, I can
be there when you talk to him
so you don't blow up,

10:22.322 --> 10:25.090
But I'm not gonna
tell him for you.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.359
Are you sure, charlie?
I mean, he's a pretty
bad assistant.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.327
That's some
cheap-ass champagne.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.796
No, no.
I'm sorry.
I can't.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.199
Okay, then.
Fine.

10:34.201 --> 10:37.102
You're getting the frown.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.803
Stop it.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.872
It's almost
as adorable
as the smile.

10:43.142 --> 10:46.211
- What are you having?
- An anxiety attack.

10:46.213 --> 10:49.714
That's not one of those
damn mixology drinks, is it?

10:49.716 --> 10:52.417
I did not become a bartender
because I wanted to think.

10:53.886 --> 10:55.420
Do you know anything
about women?

10:55.422 --> 10:57.956
I'm gonna talk
to you anyway.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.858
Go ahead.

10:59.860 --> 11:03.361
I was taking pictures
of this girl who always
ignores me,

11:03.363 --> 11:05.330
And then out of the blue,
she kissed me.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.666
Did anything happen
before she kissed you?

11:07.668 --> 11:10.669
I said something about
how the left side of her face

11:10.671 --> 11:12.237
Isn't as good
as the right.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.806
- And this is a pretty girl?
- Very.

11:14.808 --> 11:18.243
You may not know this
'cause you're a dork...

11:18.245 --> 11:20.245
Go on.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.313
...But women who base
their self-esteem

11:22.315 --> 11:24.382
On their looks
are usually pretty insecure,

11:24.384 --> 11:27.085
So when you point out a flaw,
it freaks them out

11:27.087 --> 11:29.287
And they would do anything
to get you to like them.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.923
So she was nice to me
because I criticized her.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.692
Cool.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.261
How come somebody as smart
as you is working behind a bar?

11:36.263 --> 11:38.129
Actually,
I'm writing a book.

11:38.131 --> 11:41.232
It's called
"conversations with idiots."

11:41.234 --> 11:44.302
Where do you find these people?
Do they just walk in?

11:44.304 --> 11:46.404
And how do you know
if they're idiots?

11:46.406 --> 11:48.707
They just show up

11:48.709 --> 11:52.110
And start asking question
after question.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.012
Like what?

11:54.014 --> 11:56.114
I'll tell you in a second.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.482
I'm just gonna grab
my notebook.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.287
<i>( dance music playing )</i>

12:06.225 --> 12:08.760
Hey, patrick.
How's the job going?

12:08.762 --> 12:10.929
Oh, my god.
Come here.

12:10.931 --> 12:15.867
Okay, so I know that
I was hired as a stylist
and not a designer,

12:15.869 --> 12:17.936
But check this out.

12:19.371 --> 12:21.239
I made this.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.241
I was hoping that cee lo
might like it and wear it
in his show.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.243
- What do you think?
- I like it.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.379
And he definitely
won't get hit by a car
if he goes outside at night.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.215
Hey, charlie!

12:30.217 --> 12:32.283
Well, I gotta go.
Sorry, patrick.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.252
Charlie,
you changed my life.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.421
I mean, I can never
repay you...

12:36.423 --> 12:38.123
Unless you have
a pair of jeans

12:38.125 --> 12:40.258
That you need hemmed
and fringed in feathers.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.327
I've been doing that
all morning.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.429
Thanks, but I don't
even wear the ones I have.

12:46.799 --> 12:48.299
- How's it going?
- Hey, charlie.

12:48.301 --> 12:53.104
Charlie, I want to
introduce you to my
fantastic assistant steve.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.472
- Steve, how are you?
- How do you do, sir?

12:54.474 --> 12:56.474
- Good, good.
- Now, without this guy
around here,

12:56.476 --> 12:58.910
The whole operation
would fall apart.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.379
Yo, steve,
would you get us
some coffee, please?

13:01.381 --> 13:03.114
- Right away.
- Thank you.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.550
Well, it looks like
you and steve have
worked things out.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.385
No, you gotta fire him.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.454
You just said the whole thing
would fall apart without him.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.357
What I didn't say is
it would fall apart
faster with him.

13:12.359 --> 13:15.226
All right, all right,
I'm not comfortable
firing him,

13:15.228 --> 13:18.196
But if you think
you're gonna lose it
when you're letting him go,

13:18.198 --> 13:20.365
Then I'll be there
to intervene until
you cool off, all right?

13:20.367 --> 13:22.967
- All right.
- Here you go.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.803
Oh, thank you.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.271
- Uh, steve.
- Yeah.

13:26.273 --> 13:29.274
Charlie's got
something to tell you.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.909
My man.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.848
So, steve...

13:36.850 --> 13:38.917
Guess who doesn't
have to work late
tonight.

13:41.821 --> 13:45.023
- You're a great
photographer, nolan.
- Aw, thanks.

13:45.025 --> 13:48.426
- I think this one's
really good.
- Yeah, maybe.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.963
I mean, after we get it
into photoshop and fix
your face.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.135
- Which part?
- You know, your, uh...

13:57.137 --> 13:59.170
My nose.
It's crooked,
isn't it?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.339
- No, it's perfect.
- It's my ears.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.909
- They're lopsided, right?
- No, they're perfect.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.911
So what part are you
talking about fixing?

14:06.913 --> 14:09.080
I don't know.
I can't do this anymore.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.949
Do what?

14:10.951 --> 14:12.550
Feed your insecurities.

14:12.552 --> 14:15.186
Lacey, the only reason
you kissed me the other day

14:15.188 --> 14:17.488
Is because I said
half your face
was messed up.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.924
So wait.

14:19.926 --> 14:22.861
- You're gaming me?
- Well, not the first time.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.863
Let me tell you
something.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.966
You can't feed
my insecurities because
I don't have any.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.334
If I'm so insecure,

14:29.336 --> 14:31.035
Why would I wanna be
a supermodel

14:31.037 --> 14:33.104
And have everybody
love me?

14:34.940 --> 14:36.941
Just get out!

14:36.943 --> 14:39.577
I'm sorry, lacey.
Please, let me kiss
that car wreck of a mouth.

14:39.579 --> 14:40.912
Out!

14:42.248 --> 14:45.016
Okay.
Give me your phone.

14:49.321 --> 14:51.656
We're not having
any distractions tonight.

14:51.658 --> 14:54.025
It's just you and me.

14:55.527 --> 14:57.996
I'll do anything you want.

14:59.231 --> 15:02.934
- Name it.
- Can you get steve
his job back?

15:04.436 --> 15:06.170
What are you
talking about?

15:06.172 --> 15:08.673
I can't stop
thinking about
this guy I fired.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.942
It was awful.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.944
You know what you
don't hear a lot of?

15:12.946 --> 15:14.979
Wailing.

15:14.981 --> 15:18.116
Wailing and a guy begging
for god to kill him.

15:19.285 --> 15:21.419
This is ridiculous.
You've got to quit.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.255
If I quit,
he'll fire patrick
and I can't do that to him.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.691
- He's finally happy.
- Well, you know what?
I'm not.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.626
Cee lo's
ruining our sex life.
I'm outta here.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.961
No, no, don't go.
Don't go.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.963
Come here.
Come here.

15:33.198 --> 15:34.933
Let's put cee lo
out of our minds

15:34.935 --> 15:36.935
And tonight it is
just about you and me.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.037
That's better.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.105
And I'm gonna rip off
every bit of your clothes.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.508
- I don't care
what they cost.
- <i>( button clatters )</i>

15:46.011 --> 15:48.379
Cee lo:
<i>Hey, charlie!</i>
<i>Is that you?</i>

15:48.381 --> 15:51.015
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

15:51.017 --> 15:54.185
You just bought yourself
an $800 blouse.

15:56.189 --> 16:01.225
- Can I call you later?
-  <i>Well, I brought</i>
<i>my girlfriend</i>

16:01.227 --> 16:02.627
<i>And I really</i>
<i>want you to meet her.</i>

16:02.629 --> 16:05.263
( sighs )
I'm going home.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.665
I'm gonna go sit
on the washing machine
with a glass of wine.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.375
- Hey, cee lo.
Come on in.
- Hey, man.

16:17.377 --> 16:20.645
( sighs )
vicki, this is charlie.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.714
He's an anger
management therapist.

16:22.716 --> 16:26.284
Charlie, this is vicki.
She's been to newark.

16:27.419 --> 16:29.287
But not the city,
just the airport.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.289
I had
a connecting flight.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.359
You know what, don't bite back.
She's telling a great story.

16:36.395 --> 16:39.697
Hey, vicki, I need
to talk to charlie
privately for a moment.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.399
You mind waiting
in the kitchen for me?

16:41.401 --> 16:44.402
- Oh, I would love to.
- Thank you.

16:48.073 --> 16:51.009
- What's going on?
- That's the best story
she's got.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.311
The newark thing.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.546
- She seems nice.
- Oh, she's great.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.715
You just gotta break up
with her for me.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.784
I'm not gonna dump
your girlfriend for you.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.553
Charlie,
it's for her own benefit.
She needs another story.

17:02.555 --> 17:05.523
Look, cee lo,
I can't do this anymore.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.025
You wanna
come to therapy,
that's fine,

17:07.027 --> 17:09.527
But I'm not gonna be
your hatchet man.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.029
Well, that's too bad,
charlie.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.097
I guess I'll just
have to hire steve back

17:13.099 --> 17:15.466
Because somebody's
gonna have to fire patrick.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.035
Don't fire patrick.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.403
He's a great guy
and very talented.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.072
It's your call,
charlie.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.777
Vicki, can I talk to you
for a minute?

17:29.048 --> 17:32.483
Hey, vicki,
you're probably not
prepared to hear this,

17:32.485 --> 17:35.219
But cee lo has something
he wants to tell you.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.289
- ( grunts )
- my man.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.133
What do you want?

17:51.203 --> 17:53.337
- So you heard.
- Yeah.

17:55.441 --> 17:58.276
- Who told you?
- Some bitch named vicki.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.713
So what are you
gonna do?

18:02.715 --> 18:04.849
Probably go back
to the department store.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.684
At least there I can make
a weekly paycheck

18:06.686 --> 18:09.253
To fuel the alcoholism
I know is coming.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.190
Patrick, I know what
you're going through.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.691
The reason I couldn't
work for cee lo

18:13.693 --> 18:18.296
That has to be
in control of my own life
and I think you are, too.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.199
Don't tell me what I am
and what I'm not.

18:21.201 --> 18:24.435
- Maybe you're right.
- If you go back to that store,

18:24.437 --> 18:26.270
You're gonna
get stuck there.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.340
And you're gonna
wake up one day,
be married to some guy,

18:29.342 --> 18:31.442
Have a chinese baby,
and just wanna play it safe.

18:32.678 --> 18:34.412
What am I supposed to do?

18:34.414 --> 18:37.115
Patrick, when I saw
that jacket that you
designed for cee lo,

18:37.117 --> 18:40.351
It was the first time
since I've known you that
I've seen any real passion.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.386
Well...

18:42.388 --> 18:45.223
I am pretty excellent.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.524
Have you thought
about design school?

18:46.526 --> 18:49.193
Only once...

18:49.195 --> 18:50.628
A day...

18:50.630 --> 18:53.131
Every day of my life.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.666
- So why don't you go?
- I can't afford it, charlie.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.736
I'm sure there's some things
you can cut back on.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.806
I don't know.
I live pretty close
to the bone.

19:01.808 --> 19:05.143
What-- oh, I'm sorry.
I thought I heard ed
say something.

19:07.346 --> 19:09.280
Well, I guess
if I had to,

19:09.282 --> 19:12.183
I could give up
on dry cleaning.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.851
Okay, that's a start.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.220
And the guy
who waters
my flowers

19:16.222 --> 19:17.788
And freshens up
my plants.

19:17.790 --> 19:21.259
I mean, I guess
I could cut him back
to once a week.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.528
Patrick, I think you can
afford design school

19:23.530 --> 19:25.329
If you just
tighten your belt.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.332
Especially if
you have someone that
does that for you, too.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.500
You know what,
you're right.

19:29.502 --> 19:33.237
- Here. This is for you.
- What is this?

19:33.239 --> 19:36.307
It's my last basket for
the fruit of the month club.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.176
I guess if I'm gonna
live out my dreams,

19:38.178 --> 19:40.645
I'm gonna have to get used
to supermarket pears.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.282
Stay strong.

19:46.418 --> 19:47.818
So how'd it go
with that girl?

19:47.820 --> 19:50.288
Well, pointing out
their flaws works,

19:50.290 --> 19:52.223
But I just couldn't do it.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.492
I had to be honest with her
about my feelings.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.694
Oh, you're a virgin,
aren't you?

20:00.566 --> 20:03.868
- Lacey.
- I've been
thinking about it.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.270
You could've taken
advantage of me
and you didn't.

20:06.272 --> 20:09.373
I'm sorry.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.975
No, it's a good thing.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.978
Just don't tell me
what's going on inside
my head ever again.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.746
I don't wanna know.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.349
Never again.
I promise.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.319
So you wanna
go out sometime?

20:21.321 --> 20:24.755
Two days ago,
I would've done
anything you wanted,

20:24.757 --> 20:27.258
But you've seen me
at my weakest,

20:27.260 --> 20:30.928
So now I'm gonna
have to reestablish
my dominance.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.997
That sounds good, too.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.869
Okay.
You can't have this.

20:42.007 --> 20:44.275
Loser!

20:48.780 --> 20:50.848
What the hell
just happened?

20:52.517 --> 20:56.354
- ( sighs )
- was that just me or was
that, like, unbelievable?

20:56.356 --> 20:57.989
I think it's because we had
so much tension built up.

20:57.991 --> 20:59.523
Yeah.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.459
Next time, we should wait,
like, three weeks.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.694
- It'll be even better.
- How 'bout four?

21:03.696 --> 21:05.563
Even better.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.932
- How 'bout now?
- Even better.

21:11.837 --> 21:14.038
<i>( bowl clatters )</i>

21:14.040 --> 21:16.407
Let's go upstairs.
It'll be more comfortable.
