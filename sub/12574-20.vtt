<i>Previously on</i> Legend
of the Seeker.

00:04.557 --> 00:06.523
The only way to close the
rift is the way the Creator

00:06.524 --> 00:08.559
sealed the Underworld.
The Stone of Tears.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.326
I think it's a compass.

00:10.327 --> 00:11.794
This orb will guide
the Seeker's way.

00:11.795 --> 00:13.561
To what? Hopefully
the Stone of Tears.

00:13.562 --> 00:15.595
Richard, we can't trust her.

00:15.596 --> 00:18.196
Twice now she's proven
herself to me. I can use her.

00:18.197 --> 00:19.664
I consider you to be my friend.

00:21.378 --> 00:22.445
I save Richard.

00:23.529 --> 00:25.129
Suddenly you wanna
defeat the Keeper?

00:25.447 --> 00:26.514
I want to live again.

00:30.617 --> 00:31.751
<i>Sister Marianna,</i>

00:31.752 --> 00:34.385
<i>Darken Rahl has betrayed me.</i>

00:34.386 --> 00:35.785
What do you ask of us?

00:35.786 --> 00:37.586
<i>Send him back to me.</i>

00:37.587 --> 00:39.788
I have no intention of going back.

00:39.789 --> 00:42.119
The only reason you
want to save the world

00:42.120 --> 00:43.119
is to save yourself.

00:45.223 --> 00:47.724
I'm sure I'll see you again,
brother.

00:47.725 --> 00:48.758
I'm sure you will.

00:51.727 --> 00:56.396
<i>Richard Cypher, you are the
true Seeker.</i>

Cara, it's me.

01:34.432 --> 01:36.399
Dahlia? You know her?

01:39.968 --> 01:41.802
We served together for many years.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.404
Why were you following us?

01:44.405 --> 01:46.805
The true Lord Rahl is in danger.

01:46.806 --> 01:48.473
I need your help to save him.

01:48.474 --> 01:50.141
Darken Rahl may have used magic

01:50.142 --> 01:52.175
to come back to the
world of the living,

01:52.176 --> 01:54.611
but Richard is the true Lord Rahl.

01:54.612 --> 01:56.546
I'm not talking about Darken Rahl.

01:56.547 --> 01:58.347
Or the Seeker.

01:58.348 --> 02:00.982
I'm talking about your son.

02:04.086 --> 02:05.285
You have a son?

02:05.286 --> 02:07.987
Many Mord-Sith bear children.

02:07.988 --> 02:10.723
But not many bear children
fathered by Darken Rahl.

02:15.294 --> 02:16.928
Why didn't you ever tell us?

02:16.929 --> 02:18.963
It wasn't important.

02:18.964 --> 02:19.998
What happened to the child?

02:19.999 --> 02:22.366
He was taken from me at birth.

02:22.367 --> 02:24.769
Oh, Cara, I'm so sorry.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.871
Don't be.

02:26.872 --> 02:30.241
It was considered an honor
to be chosen by Lord Rahl.

02:34.846 --> 02:36.180
You know where the baby was taken?

02:36.181 --> 02:37.681
Male children born to Mord-Sith

02:37.682 --> 02:39.683
are sent to be raised
by the Dragon Corps

02:39.684 --> 02:42.119
to learn to fight for D'Hara.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.720
When Darken Rahl died,
my Sisters and I

02:43.721 --> 02:45.321
went to find the boy.

02:45.322 --> 02:47.089
We took him back to our
temple and served him

02:47.090 --> 02:49.689
like the true Lord Rahl
he will one day become.

02:49.690 --> 02:53.686
But a week ago, our temple was
raided by Sisters of the Dark.

02:53.687 --> 02:57.453
The Sisters' powers are
useless against Mord-Sith.

02:57.454 --> 03:00.121
We thought so too,
but they've grown stronger.

03:00.122 --> 03:03.324
We couldn't repel their magic.

03:03.325 --> 03:05.459
I was the only
Mord-Sith to survive.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.126
The Sisters took the boy.

03:07.127 --> 03:08.961
Where? I tracked them to a retreat

03:08.962 --> 03:10.529
in the hills of Eritrane,

03:10.530 --> 03:13.898
but I knew I wouldn't be
able to rescue him on my own.

03:16.401 --> 03:18.735
We have more important things to do

03:18.736 --> 03:20.504
than chase after a missing child.

03:20.505 --> 03:24.641
Cara, there's nothing more
important than your son.

03:25.976 --> 03:28.344
He's the future of D'Hara,

03:28.345 --> 03:31.547
and he needs your help.

03:31.548 --> 03:33.081
You know I can't read a Mord-Sith.

03:37.319 --> 03:40.422
Do you think we can trust her?

03:42.158 --> 03:43.859
I've known her for a long time.

03:43.860 --> 03:45.827
Before we were Mord-Sith,
we were schoolmates.

03:45.828 --> 03:48.229
She was taken from Stowecroft too.

03:48.230 --> 03:49.563
If there's even a chance

03:49.564 --> 03:51.231
she's telling the truth,

03:51.232 --> 03:53.000
we need to find this boy.

03:53.001 --> 03:54.603
What we need to find
is the Stone of Tears.

03:54.604 --> 03:57.372
This could be a trap set
by the Sisters of the Dark

03:57.373 --> 03:59.908
to take you away from your quest.

03:59.909 --> 04:02.410
Cara, we're talking about a child.

04:02.411 --> 04:03.511
Your son.

04:05.881 --> 04:07.615
He means nothing to me.

04:07.616 --> 04:10.685
Whether you care for him or not,
the child is out there.

04:10.686 --> 04:13.687
A child with Rahl blood,
possibly Rahl magic.

04:13.688 --> 04:14.921
If Sisters of the Dark have him,

04:14.922 --> 04:16.589
there's no telling
what nefarious purpose

04:16.589 --> 04:18.057
they have for him.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.357
Zedd, go with Cara.

04:19.358 --> 04:21.757
If Sisters of the Dark
have learned new magic,

04:21.757 --> 04:23.391
she may need your help.

04:23.392 --> 04:26.026
Kahlan and I will keep
following the compass.

04:26.027 --> 04:28.027
We'll catch up with you
just as soon as we can.

04:55.955 --> 04:58.389
And the Seeker
defeated Darken Rahl,

04:58.390 --> 05:01.258
and the people were freed
forever from his cruelty.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.293
That's a lovely story.

05:03.294 --> 05:04.927
Tell me another one.

05:04.928 --> 05:06.429
Do you want to hear my favorite?

05:06.430 --> 05:08.830
I want to hear all your stories.

05:08.831 --> 05:13.464
It's about a man who
loves a woman so much

05:13.465 --> 05:16.133
that he would give his life
twice over just to hold her.

05:16.134 --> 05:17.835
I know that one.

05:17.836 --> 05:20.303
It doesn't end the
way you want it to.

05:20.304 --> 05:22.572
Elodie, I would swim
across an ocean.

05:22.573 --> 05:23.939
I would slay dragons.

05:23.940 --> 05:27.576
Anything to touch you just once.

05:38.083 --> 05:39.617
Elodie.

05:39.618 --> 05:40.985
I have to go.

05:40.986 --> 05:42.853
Wait.

05:42.854 --> 05:44.088
When will I--?

05:45.757 --> 05:48.258
Who were you talking to?

05:48.259 --> 05:50.827
I was just praying to the Creator.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.994
And she has heard your prayers.

05:52.995 --> 05:55.763
The Seeker is getting close.

06:10.379 --> 06:12.979
The compass is telling
us to go straight ahead.

06:12.980 --> 06:14.847
That's impossible.

06:14.848 --> 06:17.248
Maybe not.

06:51.743 --> 06:55.283
Does he always sleep so loudly?

07:02.354 --> 07:05.923
If I were a Wizard traveling
with two Mord-Sith,

07:05.924 --> 07:08.925
I'd sleep with one eye open.

07:08.926 --> 07:10.393
Zedd trusts me.

07:10.394 --> 07:14.464
He doesn't question your loyalties?

07:14.465 --> 07:16.532
He has no reason to.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.603
I'm glad you decided
to come with me.

07:21.604 --> 07:24.472
I came because Richard
ordered me to.

07:26.575 --> 07:28.442
Are you sorry you did?

07:30.712 --> 07:31.812
No.

07:37.652 --> 07:39.219
Neither am I.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.714
This isn't so bad.

08:05.715 --> 08:07.516
Sleeping in a cold, dark cave?

08:07.517 --> 08:09.351
Being alone together.

08:11.054 --> 08:12.388
I can't remember the last time.

08:12.389 --> 08:13.623
It's nice.

08:21.297 --> 08:23.965
I, uh-- I hope Cara's all right.

08:23.966 --> 08:26.200
And the boy.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.969
If anyone could take on
the Sisters of the Dark,

08:28.970 --> 08:31.204
it's the son of Cara
and Darken Rahl.

08:31.205 --> 08:33.740
Can you imagine what that
child is going to be like?

08:33.741 --> 08:34.974
Smart.

08:36.977 --> 08:38.813
Stubborn.

08:38.815 --> 08:41.583
Powerful.

08:41.585 --> 08:45.354
Enough to take over the world.

08:45.355 --> 08:48.056
Who could stop him?

08:48.057 --> 08:50.659
Our child.

08:56.965 --> 08:59.900
Well, our child would
have to be a girl.

08:59.901 --> 09:03.502
A girl that could take out
a dozen D'Haran soldiers,

09:03.503 --> 09:06.004
just like her mother.

09:06.005 --> 09:09.607
Well, I'd want her
to have a good heart,

09:09.608 --> 09:11.709
like her father.

09:13.479 --> 09:17.748
Well, I would want her to
have her mother's eyes.

09:17.749 --> 09:20.483
No. No.

09:20.484 --> 09:22.685
I'd want her to have your eyes.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.041
Richard.

09:47.643 --> 09:49.244
We can't. It's all right.

09:49.245 --> 09:51.112
It's just a kiss.

09:51.113 --> 09:54.380
And Zedd and Cara aren't here.

09:54.381 --> 09:56.582
That's the problem.

09:58.785 --> 10:00.685
When they're with
us it's easy for me

10:00.686 --> 10:02.219
not to grab you and kiss you,

10:02.220 --> 10:05.155
but without them,

10:05.156 --> 10:08.657
there's nothing stopping
us except good judgment.

10:10.092 --> 10:11.526
When you kiss me like that, I--

10:11.527 --> 10:15.728
I feel that judgment slipping away.

10:56.397 --> 10:59.198
It's a good thing the
Wizard sleeps so soundly.

11:03.236 --> 11:04.936
If we move quickly
we can reach Eritrane

11:04.937 --> 11:06.771
and rescue the child
before nightfall.

11:10.542 --> 11:13.277
And then you'll go back to
the Seeker and his quest?

11:13.278 --> 11:14.278
Yes.

11:14.279 --> 11:15.746
You don't have to.

11:15.747 --> 11:17.614
You could stay with me.

11:17.615 --> 11:19.716
We could raise the
Lord Rahl together.

11:19.717 --> 11:22.117
Richard is the Lord Rahl.

11:23.353 --> 11:26.354
Cara, you led the
charge at Pallus Ridge.

11:26.355 --> 11:28.489
You were merciless at Valeria.

11:28.490 --> 11:30.958
You once swore to kill
the man you now serve.

11:32.927 --> 11:34.627
What happened to you?

11:36.597 --> 11:37.863
Richard.

11:45.871 --> 11:49.373
The Seeker could use a fighter
as strong as you, Dahlia.

11:51.676 --> 11:53.343
We could serve him together.

12:01.948 --> 12:03.982
I should wake Zedd.

12:47.187 --> 12:50.257
Oh, it's beautiful.

12:51.459 --> 12:54.093
Look at the compass.

13:11.504 --> 13:13.104
You must be the Seeker.

13:13.105 --> 13:15.039
Yes.

13:16.574 --> 13:17.808
<i>Bless the Creator</i>

13:17.809 --> 13:21.577
<i>Whose light and wisdom</i>
<i>Are eternal</i>

13:23.346 --> 13:24.879
Who are you?

13:24.880 --> 13:26.681
My name is Asa.

13:26.682 --> 13:29.683
We've been waiting for
you for a very long time.

14:11.155 --> 14:14.324
The Stone of Tears.

14:19.131 --> 14:20.865
In the beginning of time,

14:20.866 --> 14:24.402
the Creator asked us to be
the Guardians of the Stone.

14:24.403 --> 14:27.806
She knew, in her infinite wisdom,
that one day,

14:27.807 --> 14:30.676
the Keeper would wage
war on the living.

14:30.677 --> 14:34.113
She told us that a Seeker
and Confessor would come

14:34.114 --> 14:36.745
to preserve the precious
life she created.

14:36.746 --> 14:39.013
We've waited thousands
of years for you.

14:39.014 --> 14:41.482
Your ancestors would be very proud.

14:41.483 --> 14:43.317
We have no ancestors.

14:43.318 --> 14:45.519
I don't understand.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.987
We're the same people to whom
the Creator gave the Stone

14:47.988 --> 14:49.422
thousands of years ago.

14:49.423 --> 14:51.423
You're the first generation.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.691
How is that possible?

14:52.692 --> 14:55.593
The Stone's magic has protected us

14:55.594 --> 14:57.328
and kept us from aging.

14:57.329 --> 14:59.229
<i>Blessed is the Creator</i>

14:59.230 --> 15:00.864
<i>Who gave us the Stone</i>

15:00.865 --> 15:03.433
We've prepared a
cottage and a hot meal.

15:03.434 --> 15:05.101
Elodie will take you. Thank you.

15:05.102 --> 15:06.102
But we can't stay.

15:06.103 --> 15:07.503
I need to get the Stone

15:07.504 --> 15:09.738
to the Pillars of Creation
as quickly as we can.

15:09.739 --> 15:11.372
The Pillars of Creation?

15:11.373 --> 15:13.740
The Scroll of Valdaire
said I had to take it there

15:13.741 --> 15:15.108
to seal the rift to the Underworld.

15:15.109 --> 15:17.044
I don't know anything
about a scroll.

15:17.045 --> 15:20.179
But the rift to the Underworld
can never be sealed.

15:20.180 --> 15:23.249
This valley will be protected
from the Keeper's destruction.

15:23.250 --> 15:26.552
So the Stone must stay
right here with us.

15:26.553 --> 15:27.521
And so must you.

15:28.758 --> 15:30.660
We came here to save the
world of the living,

15:30.661 --> 15:32.127
not to hide from the Keeper.

15:32.128 --> 15:34.129
The compass led you here,
didn't it?

15:34.130 --> 15:36.131
Yes, but-- The compass was a gift

15:36.132 --> 15:37.265
from the Creator.

15:37.266 --> 15:39.700
One of our own, Ulrich,

15:39.701 --> 15:42.069
sacrificed his eternal life

15:42.070 --> 15:43.837
and carried the compass
out of the valley

15:43.838 --> 15:45.105
so that when the end was near

15:45.106 --> 15:47.640
you would find it, Seeker,
and be led back to us.

15:47.641 --> 15:50.544
We found the compass in the tomb
of the first Abbot of Ulrich.

15:50.545 --> 15:53.246
The order must have
been named after him.

15:53.247 --> 15:56.482
I know nothing about
orders and abbots,

15:56.483 --> 15:57.817
but I know you will save the world.

15:57.818 --> 15:59.451
How?

16:00.887 --> 16:05.256
In time, after the
destruction is over,

16:05.257 --> 16:06.958
you and the Mother Confessor

16:06.959 --> 16:09.059
will leave our valley

16:09.060 --> 16:12.161
and begin the world anew.

16:14.330 --> 16:16.297
We can't have children.

16:16.298 --> 16:18.398
That's why we need you.

16:18.399 --> 16:22.569
Your children will be the
new first generation.

16:22.570 --> 16:26.807
That is the Creator's will.

16:26.808 --> 16:29.610
Even if this is true,
I don't believe the Creator

16:29.611 --> 16:31.644
wants everyone else
in the world to die.

16:31.645 --> 16:33.112
Since you are here,

16:33.113 --> 16:35.481
it means the world's already
been corrupted by the Keeper.

16:35.482 --> 16:36.816
The people are wicked.

16:36.817 --> 16:38.818
You don't need to mourn their loss.

16:38.819 --> 16:40.886
That's not true.

16:40.887 --> 16:42.788
There are good people in the world.

16:42.789 --> 16:44.589
Asa.

16:44.590 --> 16:46.724
We haven't left this
valley or seen the Creator

16:46.725 --> 16:48.426
for thousands of years.

16:48.427 --> 16:51.095
Maybe they know more about
the outside than we do.

16:51.096 --> 16:55.966
The Creator has told
us all we need to know.

16:55.967 --> 16:58.768
But I can't let the rest of
the world fall to the Keeper.

16:58.769 --> 17:00.837
Not if there's a chance to save it.

17:00.838 --> 17:03.438
If you take the Stone
out of this valley

17:03.439 --> 17:06.040
and fail to stop the Keeper,

17:06.040 --> 17:07.174
the world will end

17:07.175 --> 17:09.342
and you and the Confessor will die.

17:09.343 --> 17:11.377
There will be no one
left to preserve life.

17:11.377 --> 17:13.645
That is how the Keeper will win.

17:13.646 --> 17:17.951
Is that a chance you're
prepared to take?

17:17.952 --> 17:19.018
Yes.

17:20.487 --> 17:23.954
Now, I don't want to fight you,
but we're leaving.

17:23.955 --> 17:27.025
We're not violent people.

17:27.026 --> 17:28.860
We can't stop you.

17:28.861 --> 17:33.431
All we can do is pray for
the Creator's guidance.

17:39.303 --> 17:41.371
<i>Blessed Creator</i>

17:41.372 --> 17:43.939
<i>Give us wisdom In
our uncertainty</i>

17:43.940 --> 17:46.641
<i>Bless us with your eternal Grace
and compassion</i>

17:46.642 --> 17:49.376
<i>Blessed Creator</i>

17:49.377 --> 17:51.812
<i>Give us wisdom In
our uncertainty</i>

17:53.181 --> 17:54.648
I don't understand.

17:54.649 --> 17:56.583
This is where we came in.

17:56.584 --> 17:57.984
The compass.

17:57.985 --> 18:00.220
That's what got us through before.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.525
The compass was created
to lead us to the Stone.

18:06.526 --> 18:09.360
Maybe now that it's done that,
its magic no longer works.

18:09.361 --> 18:12.896
We need to find another way out.

18:18.037 --> 18:21.005
How much further to Eritrane?

18:21.006 --> 18:22.440
We're close.

18:22.441 --> 18:24.709
Oh! Dahlia, no!

18:50.876 --> 18:52.243
Why are you doing this?

18:52.244 --> 18:54.845
When it's all over,
you'll be glad I did.

19:09.660 --> 19:11.226
Welcome home, Cara.

19:12.994 --> 19:15.394
Your sisters and I have missed you.

19:25.445 --> 19:26.678
Where's Zedd?

19:26.679 --> 19:29.512
Your concern for the
Wizard is touching.

19:31.982 --> 19:34.517
I shall put your
tender heart at ease.

19:34.518 --> 19:36.518
He's alive. For now.

19:36.519 --> 19:39.021
What do you want with us?

19:39.022 --> 19:41.189
Isn't it obvious?

19:41.190 --> 19:43.891
I want you back on my side.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.260
Though I must admit

19:46.261 --> 19:50.365
you haven't made it easy for me.

19:50.366 --> 19:55.236
I may no longer have
armies at my command.

19:55.237 --> 19:57.304
But fortunately,

19:57.305 --> 20:01.575
I knew of your special
friendship with Dahlia.

20:01.576 --> 20:06.080
I knew she would want you
back as much as I do.

20:07.382 --> 20:10.150
My son

20:10.151 --> 20:12.952
was never kidnapped,

20:12.953 --> 20:14.053
was he?

20:15.757 --> 20:18.459
Your son was killed
the day he was born.

20:18.460 --> 20:22.196
I couldn't risk the
little bastard growing up

20:22.197 --> 20:24.998
to challenge my authority,
now, could I?

20:26.500 --> 20:29.202
Oh, Cara.

20:29.203 --> 20:31.938
Has that made you sad?

20:31.939 --> 20:34.907
You really have grown soft since
you started serving the Seeker,

20:34.908 --> 20:36.141
haven't you?

20:38.678 --> 20:41.579
It's my fault, I suppose.

20:41.580 --> 20:44.716
I left your training to underlings.

20:44.717 --> 20:47.518
But someone as valuable as you

20:47.519 --> 20:51.892
deserves my personal attention.

20:54.395 --> 20:57.597
This time,

20:57.598 --> 21:00.033
I won't make the same mistake.

21:09.111 --> 21:10.945
We're right back where we started.

21:10.946 --> 21:13.382
There's no getting
through these cliffs.

21:14.451 --> 21:17.252
If we can't go through...

21:18.721 --> 21:21.858
we'll go over.

21:41.012 --> 21:42.379
Where's Cara?

21:57.392 --> 22:00.694
Whatever your plan is,
it will fail.

22:00.695 --> 22:03.197
Richard will find me.

22:03.198 --> 22:06.266
And he will humiliate you again.

22:06.267 --> 22:08.501
Oh, poor Cara.

22:08.502 --> 22:12.004
You actually believe the
Seeker would stop his quest

22:12.005 --> 22:13.506
simply to save you?

22:14.909 --> 22:17.378
You're not that important.

22:17.379 --> 22:20.047
Lord Rahl.

22:20.048 --> 22:23.551
Our scouts report
no sign of enemies.

22:23.552 --> 22:27.288
If you'd like, I can call
them back to break the Wizard.

22:27.289 --> 22:28.423
No.

22:28.424 --> 22:29.691
Keep them on watch.

22:29.692 --> 22:33.095
The Sisters of the Dark have
been following me for weeks.

22:33.096 --> 22:35.430
They can't be far behind.

22:35.431 --> 22:38.400
And as for the Wizard with
the rada'han around his neck,

22:38.401 --> 22:41.637
he's nothing more
than a frail old man.

22:41.638 --> 22:45.774
My Lord, you've been
exhausting yourself for hours.

22:45.775 --> 22:48.943
Let me continue her training
so you can get some rest.

22:52.180 --> 22:53.447
Hm.

22:55.449 --> 22:59.251
Put pain before pleasure, Dahlia.

23:24.605 --> 23:27.641
I wish there were another way.

23:34.782 --> 23:37.216
Why did you lie to me?

23:40.286 --> 23:42.420
Remember when we were little girls?

23:42.421 --> 23:47.124
How terrifying the
Agiels were then?

23:47.125 --> 23:49.459
How much they hurt?

23:50.861 --> 23:52.729
You held my hand so tightly,

23:52.730 --> 23:55.331
it was the only thing
that kept me from crying.

23:55.332 --> 23:59.634
We knew if we cried they'd
just torture us more.

23:59.635 --> 24:05.239
We survived because we protected
each other from our weaknesses.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.841
That's what I'm doing now.

24:09.177 --> 24:12.278
The Seeker has made you soft.

24:12.279 --> 24:15.948
He's poisoned you
against your Sisters.

24:15.949 --> 24:17.683
Your family.

24:17.684 --> 24:22.720
Richard, Kahlan and Zedd

24:22.721 --> 24:24.388
are my family.

24:25.757 --> 24:27.891
They hardly know you.

24:27.892 --> 24:30.193
They can't love you like I do.

24:45.506 --> 24:48.207
It seems Lord Rahl has
been too gentle with you.

24:48.208 --> 24:52.210
I'll let him know he needs to
apply himself more forcefully.

25:08.523 --> 25:09.556
We're almost there.

25:14.861 --> 25:16.395
Give me your hand.

25:20.533 --> 25:21.967
Oh!

25:21.968 --> 25:23.201
Oh!

25:28.540 --> 25:30.340
Hold on!

25:35.614 --> 25:37.347
Take my hand!

25:37.348 --> 25:39.683
No, we'll both fall!

25:39.684 --> 25:41.051
It's all right, I'll catch you.

25:41.052 --> 25:42.018
Ah!

25:47.392 --> 25:49.693
Come on!

25:51.129 --> 25:52.229
Come on!

25:52.230 --> 25:54.931
We can't let the Keeper win.

25:56.767 --> 25:59.602
You have to go on without me.

26:01.071 --> 26:02.138
Kahlan, don't!

26:04.007 --> 26:05.541
I love you, Richard.

26:05.542 --> 26:06.976
No!

26:06.977 --> 26:09.478
Kahlan, no.

26:15.418 --> 26:19.053
No

26:19.054 --> 26:21.155
Kahlan!

26:54.806 --> 26:55.906
Oh!

27:06.062 --> 27:07.195
How?

27:07.196 --> 27:08.897
I don't know.

27:08.898 --> 27:11.097
Just when I thought I was
gonna hit the ground,

27:11.098 --> 27:14.065
I found myself standing right here.

27:17.239 --> 27:20.940
The Guardians are using magic to
keep us trapped in this valley.

27:25.677 --> 27:28.344
You came back.

27:28.345 --> 27:30.380
Praise the Creator.

27:30.381 --> 27:31.714
Take the spell off now.

27:31.715 --> 27:34.249
It would be impossible
for us to cast a spell.

27:34.250 --> 27:35.383
We don't have any magic.

27:35.384 --> 27:37.518
Well, then, tell us how to get out.

27:37.519 --> 27:39.787
None of us has ever tried to leave.

27:43.627 --> 27:44.927
He's telling the truth.

27:44.928 --> 27:46.095
There must be a way out.

27:46.096 --> 27:49.631
We prayed to the Creator
to keep you safe.

27:49.632 --> 27:53.501
And she answered our prayers.

27:54.703 --> 27:56.437
<i>Bless the Creator</i>

27:56.438 --> 27:59.339
<i>Whose light and wisdom</i>
<i>Are eternal</i>

28:05.312 --> 28:07.947
I know what you're doing, Cara.

28:07.948 --> 28:10.250
You're dividing your mind.

28:18.593 --> 28:21.360
You're thinking about your friends.

28:21.361 --> 28:26.599
But happy thoughts about Richard
are not going to protect you.

28:26.600 --> 28:29.101
They already have.

28:29.102 --> 28:31.671
And if you were half
the Lord Rahl he is,

28:31.672 --> 28:33.840
you wouldn't have to break someone

28:33.841 --> 28:36.843
to get her to do what you want.

28:45.319 --> 28:46.452
Lord Rahl.

28:46.453 --> 28:49.288
The scouts have spotted
the Sisters of the Dark.

28:49.289 --> 28:52.291
They're closing in on us.
We don't have much time.

28:52.292 --> 28:53.792
We'll have to take
Cara somewhere else

28:53.793 --> 28:55.561
to finish her training.

28:57.363 --> 28:59.164
No, let them come.

28:59.165 --> 29:00.565
My Lord?

29:00.566 --> 29:04.237
Perhaps they can help make
our Cara more cooperative.

29:08.942 --> 29:12.177
You have betrayed the Keeper,
Darken Rahl.

29:12.178 --> 29:14.846
Only a fool would try
to bargain with him now.

29:14.847 --> 29:16.247
Oh, I think you'll disagree

29:16.248 --> 29:18.282
when you hear what I am
about to accomplish for him.

29:18.283 --> 29:20.352
The only thing he wants from you

29:20.353 --> 29:23.522
is the pleasure of tormenting
your soul for all eternity.

29:23.523 --> 29:25.859
I'm quite sure there
is something he wants

29:25.860 --> 29:27.694
even more than that.

29:29.163 --> 29:30.899
The Stone of Tears.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.768
The Keeper thinks
I've betrayed him.

29:32.769 --> 29:34.871
He is wrong.

29:34.872 --> 29:38.241
I am on the verge of finally
getting the Stone for him.

29:38.242 --> 29:41.611
Something he has been
unable to do himself

29:41.612 --> 29:44.580
since the beginning of time.

29:44.581 --> 29:46.682
If you help me achieve
this victory for him,

29:46.683 --> 29:47.850
I have no doubt that the Keeper

29:47.851 --> 29:52.020
will reward you beyond imagining.

29:55.087 --> 29:57.254
What do you propose?

30:06.361 --> 30:07.595
What are they doing?

30:07.596 --> 30:08.862
They are imbuing the Agiel

30:08.863 --> 30:10.664
with the suffering of every soul

30:10.665 --> 30:12.900
that Cara has tortured and killed.

30:12.901 --> 30:17.673
When they're finished,
its touch will be more painful to her

30:17.674 --> 30:21.142
than all the fires
of the Underworld.

30:33.355 --> 30:34.688
My Lord, be careful.

30:37.124 --> 30:40.590
Don't worry, Dahlia.

30:40.591 --> 30:44.525
This Agiel can't hurt anyone...

30:45.727 --> 30:49.361
but Cara.

30:57.636 --> 31:00.003
I'm going to enjoy this.

31:09.446 --> 31:11.548
We'll get out of here.

31:13.852 --> 31:15.419
What if we don't?

31:15.420 --> 31:20.056
Richard, we'll never see
Zedd again, or Cara,

31:20.057 --> 31:21.924
or my sister.

31:21.925 --> 31:23.759
Why should they die at
the hands of the Keeper

31:23.760 --> 31:25.094
if we get to live?

31:25.095 --> 31:27.596
Kahlan, I don't believe
this is the Creator's plan

31:27.597 --> 31:28.997
any more than you do.

31:28.998 --> 31:32.567
But if we can't get out of here,

31:32.568 --> 31:33.968
maybe we can do
what they're saying.

31:35.037 --> 31:36.570
Start the world over again?

31:38.506 --> 31:40.173
We could have those
children we imagined.

31:44.511 --> 31:46.512
Richard.

31:46.513 --> 31:49.981
If we had children,
you would be confessed.

31:49.982 --> 31:52.083
Maybe not.

31:52.084 --> 31:55.619
If there is a Creator,
and this is her plan for us,

31:55.620 --> 31:58.821
maybe it's because she
knows that we're--

31:58.822 --> 32:01.591
I don't know, different somehow.

32:01.592 --> 32:04.827
Maybe our love for each
other would protect us.

32:04.828 --> 32:06.662
And if we're not different

32:06.663 --> 32:08.564
and you're confessed to me?

32:08.565 --> 32:10.365
What would it matter?

32:10.366 --> 32:11.867
It wouldn't distract
me from my quest.

32:11.868 --> 32:13.201
I wouldn't have one anymore.

32:13.202 --> 32:16.671
And even if I were confessed,

32:16.672 --> 32:20.241
I couldn't possibly love you
any more than I already do.

32:27.650 --> 32:29.384
I'm sorry to disturb you.

32:29.385 --> 32:31.886
I just wanted to
leave you some food.

32:31.887 --> 32:35.623
The Creator has provided us
with wonderful things to eat,

32:35.624 --> 32:37.526
a beautiful place to live.

32:37.527 --> 32:39.561
Maybe you could learn
to like it here.

32:39.562 --> 32:41.029
How could we like it here

32:41.030 --> 32:43.397
when our friends on the
outside are suffering?

32:43.398 --> 32:45.165
But you're safe here.

32:45.166 --> 32:47.968
In a world free from the Keeper

32:47.969 --> 32:50.704
and banelings and Darken Rahl.

32:52.140 --> 32:54.841
Asa said none of you have
ever left this valley.

32:54.842 --> 32:57.477
How do you know about
banelings and Darken Rahl?

32:57.478 --> 33:00.847
There are stories written
in the ancient scrolls.

33:00.848 --> 33:02.215
She's lying.

33:03.884 --> 33:06.018
Do you understand
what a Confessor does?

33:06.019 --> 33:09.420
If you do not tell us the truth,
I will release my power

33:09.421 --> 33:11.589
and you will be my slave
for as long as I live.

33:11.590 --> 33:16.060
And in this valley, that is
going to be a very long time.

33:16.061 --> 33:17.228
I'll tell you, but please,

33:17.229 --> 33:18.562
you can't tell Asa

33:18.563 --> 33:20.264
or he'll take the
ring away from me.

33:20.265 --> 33:22.400
What ring?

33:22.401 --> 33:25.869
Asa told you of Ulrich,

33:25.870 --> 33:28.038
who took the compass
out of our valley.

33:28.039 --> 33:32.375
Before he left, the Creator
made two magical rings

33:32.376 --> 33:35.811
so that Ulrich could speak to
Asa even when he was far away.

33:37.013 --> 33:38.113
When Asa slept,

33:38.114 --> 33:39.581
I'd take the ring

33:39.582 --> 33:41.283
so that I could speak to Ulrich.

33:41.284 --> 33:43.084
I was in love with him

33:43.085 --> 33:46.420
and this was the only way
we could be together.

33:46.421 --> 33:49.756
But he grew old and you didn't.

33:49.757 --> 33:51.625
When Ulrich died,

33:51.626 --> 33:53.296
Asa cast his ring away.

33:54.866 --> 33:59.206
But I found it and
secretly kept it.

33:59.207 --> 34:02.476
Sometimes I would take it
out to remember Ulrich.

34:02.477 --> 34:07.115
One day, I put the ring on and
an old woman appeared to me.

34:07.116 --> 34:09.083
The old woman told me
she'd bought the ring

34:09.083 --> 34:10.817
from a traveling merchant.

34:10.818 --> 34:14.955
The ring has fallen into
many hands over the years,

34:14.956 --> 34:16.889
and I've made many more friends.

34:16.891 --> 34:18.659
Who has the other ring now?

34:18.659 --> 34:21.696
His name is Alastair.

34:21.697 --> 34:24.232
He's the first man I've
loved since Ulrich.

34:24.233 --> 34:25.801
I need to speak with him.

34:25.802 --> 34:28.937
This may be our only chance
of stopping the Keeper.

34:28.938 --> 34:31.839
But I would be defying
Asa and the Creator.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.975
Elodie, if we don't
take this chance,

34:33.976 --> 34:36.311
good people are going to die.

34:36.312 --> 34:38.482
Do you believe that's
what the Creator wants?

34:38.483 --> 34:41.351
I need to use the ring.

34:41.353 --> 34:42.987
When I last saw Zedd,

34:42.989 --> 34:44.656
we were on the road near Dalmoore.

34:44.657 --> 34:46.625
He headed east towards Eritrane.

34:46.626 --> 34:47.926
He said he'd come back to find us

34:47.927 --> 34:49.159
when his mission was finished.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.692
Travel in the direction he went,

34:50.693 --> 34:51.992
and if we're lucky,

34:51.993 --> 34:53.494
you'll find him
heading back your way.

34:54.996 --> 34:56.530
I need you to give him the ring.

34:56.531 --> 35:00.033
And then he'll be able to
get you out of the valley.

35:00.034 --> 35:01.601
And Elodie too?

35:05.472 --> 35:08.641
I don't know.

35:12.813 --> 35:17.616
Your training is
finally over, Cara.

35:17.617 --> 35:20.719
But now you face one final test

35:20.720 --> 35:24.623
to ensure that you are re-broken.

35:33.933 --> 35:37.201
I want you to kill the Wizard.

35:52.191 --> 35:54.025
I know you, Cara.

35:55.117 --> 35:57.118
This isn't who you are.

36:01.522 --> 36:03.356
Don't keep me waiting, Cara.

36:12.932 --> 36:14.565
Cara, no!

36:18.436 --> 36:20.504
I told you I serve Richard.

36:24.474 --> 36:26.141
We don't have much time before

36:26.142 --> 36:27.708
the Sisters of the Dark come back.

36:37.083 --> 36:38.517
Let's go.

36:38.518 --> 36:40.385
We need the key to the rada'han.

36:48.159 --> 36:49.359
No, Cara!

36:49.360 --> 36:50.827
If you kill him,
he'll tell the Keeper

36:50.828 --> 36:52.495
where Richard is supposed
to take the Stone.

36:59.604 --> 37:01.204
Excuse me, friends.

37:01.205 --> 37:03.139
Have you seen a tall man
with long white hair

37:03.140 --> 37:05.342
pass through here?
I spoke to a man in Dalmoore.

37:05.343 --> 37:07.510
He said he had seen him on
this road a few days ago.

37:07.511 --> 37:11.379
We might be able to help you.

37:11.380 --> 37:13.114
But it'll cost you 10 shillings.

37:13.115 --> 37:14.516
I don't have any money.

37:14.517 --> 37:17.285
I'll have to ask somewhere else.

37:17.286 --> 37:18.219
No!

37:20.488 --> 37:21.488
Ah.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.056
You can't take that!

37:25.293 --> 37:26.494
Please.

37:26.495 --> 37:27.662
I-It can't be worth much to you,

37:27.663 --> 37:29.631
but the fate of the
world depends on it.

37:29.632 --> 37:31.966
The fate of the world?

37:31.967 --> 37:34.535
Well, no one's ever tried
that excuse before.

37:45.881 --> 37:47.782
Are you all right, young man?

37:49.485 --> 37:51.086
You're Zeddicus the Wizard.

37:51.087 --> 37:52.587
That's right.

37:52.588 --> 37:54.922
The Seeker told me to find you.

37:59.092 --> 38:02.327
I can't even sense
where the portal is.

38:02.328 --> 38:05.030
Whatever magic allowed you
to pass through this rock

38:05.031 --> 38:06.531
is beyond my powers.

38:06.532 --> 38:08.367
If you can't get in,

38:08.368 --> 38:09.902
what about the spell of taking?

38:09.903 --> 38:12.306
It doesn't work on living things.

38:12.307 --> 38:14.409
I can't use it to get
you out of the valley.

38:14.410 --> 38:18.212
No, but you once used it to take
the Sword and compass from me.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.680
It might work on
the Stone of Tears.

38:20.681 --> 38:22.748
It might, but the last time
I performed that spell,

38:22.749 --> 38:24.015
I had Shota's help.

38:24.016 --> 38:26.050
I don't know if I
can do it on my own.

38:26.051 --> 38:27.518
We have to try, Zedd.

38:27.519 --> 38:29.287
And maybe if you get
the Stone out of here,

38:29.288 --> 38:30.854
the compass will
start working again.

38:30.855 --> 38:32.722
And lead you out of the valley

38:32.723 --> 38:34.490
But if it doesn't,

38:34.491 --> 38:36.125
and Kahlan and I are
trapped here forever,

38:36.126 --> 38:37.927
you'll still have the Stone.

38:37.928 --> 38:41.972
You and Cara can take it to the
Pillars of Creation without us.

38:41.973 --> 38:44.443
The spell is more likely to
work if I can see the Stone.

39:06.965 --> 39:08.566
It worked.

39:12.270 --> 39:13.504
So does the compass.

39:14.839 --> 39:17.141
I'll see you soon my boy.

39:20.078 --> 39:22.746
Zedd, what's wrong?

39:22.747 --> 39:24.148
Cara, why?

39:25.783 --> 39:27.617
My master ordered me to.

39:33.959 --> 39:36.094
Zedd? Zedd!

39:36.095 --> 39:38.029
Richard, what's happening?
I don't know.

39:44.305 --> 39:45.239
Zedd, are you all right?

39:48.310 --> 39:50.445
Cara attacked me.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.981
She took the Stone.

39:53.982 --> 39:56.684
I thought she had withstood
Rahl's attempts to re-break her,

39:56.685 --> 39:59.853
but obviously I was deceived.

39:59.854 --> 40:01.486
Stay where you are.

40:01.487 --> 40:04.122
We'll be there as soon as we can.

40:11.797 --> 40:13.931
The Stone is gone.

40:15.833 --> 40:18.000
We can feel it.

40:19.869 --> 40:21.202
What have you done with it?

40:21.203 --> 40:22.737
I sent it out of the valley.

40:22.738 --> 40:24.305
Who has it now?

40:27.510 --> 40:29.310
The compass is working again.

40:29.311 --> 40:31.245
We'll get the Stone back

40:31.246 --> 40:33.280
and take it to the
Pillars of Creation.

40:36.416 --> 40:39.750
I know this isn't what you
thought the Creator intended,

40:39.751 --> 40:43.421
but we're going to
defeat the Keeper.

40:48.592 --> 40:51.627
For the sake of the world...

40:52.996 --> 40:54.897
I hope you're right.

41:23.621 --> 41:25.588
You can't imagine
what it's been like,

41:25.589 --> 41:30.492
to be able to see each other,
but never be able to touch.

41:33.529 --> 41:36.597
I'm happy for you both.

41:40.734 --> 41:42.100
We need to get the Stone back.

41:42.101 --> 41:44.268
What about Cara?

41:47.772 --> 41:49.039
Dahlia.

42:10.292 --> 42:12.859
I see that you've returned

42:12.860 --> 42:15.961
to the bosom of your family, Cara.

42:17.995 --> 42:19.396
My Lord.

42:23.100 --> 42:27.869
You played our little scene
for the Wizard brilliantly.

42:27.870 --> 42:29.803
I brought what you asked for.

42:45.519 --> 42:48.154
It's good to have you back.
