WEBVTT

00:50.134 --> 00:51.177
Shh!

01:17.787 --> 01:19.455
Hey, what's that?

01:21.540 --> 01:22.959
A tree?

01:26.295 --> 01:28.297
Now I have to move it.

01:39.183 --> 01:40.977
Well, gang, we're almost there.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.478
Isn't it a groovy idea...

01:42.645 --> 01:45.690
holding the school dance
and hayride on an old farm?

01:46.148 --> 01:48.401
I'll say. I can hardly wait
to get there.

01:48.567 --> 01:51.988
And I can hardly wait to get
my hands on the buffet table.

01:52.154 --> 01:55.658
Just think, like, real
chocolate-covered corn on the cob.

01:59.203 --> 02:02.832
Hey, take a look at Scooby.
He's really slicking up.

02:02.999 --> 02:06.127
I guess he's getting ready
to put on the dog.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.724
- Hey! What's that?
- What? What?

02:20.182 --> 02:22.268
Looks like there's been
an accident.

02:22.435 --> 02:24.645
And there's someone
lying in the road.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.523
It's a bank guard.
Is he all right?

02:27.690 --> 02:30.735
I think so. He just got
a bad conk on the head.

02:31.068 --> 02:34.405
Like, wow! This is the craziest
accident I ever saw!

02:34.697 --> 02:38.576
Not a scratch on the outside,
but a real wreck on the inside.

02:39.368 --> 02:42.079
Wreck, nothing.
This car's been ransacked.

02:42.246 --> 02:44.582
Maybe the bank guard
can give us some answers.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.377
He's coming around.

02:48.878 --> 02:53.132
The flame will tell the Creeper.

02:53.299 --> 02:54.383
The Creeper?

02:54.550 --> 02:55.885
The Creeper?

02:56.052 --> 02:59.263
Like, wow! This is creepy.
Who's the Creeper?

02:59.430 --> 03:02.308
And what's with that piece of paper
he handed you, Freddy?

03:02.808 --> 03:04.935
I don't know. It's blank.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.937
Over here! Over here!

03:07.605 --> 03:09.065
Look. Look at this!

03:09.231 --> 03:11.567
<i>- Scooby's</i> found something.
- What is it?

03:11.942 --> 03:13.402
It's...

03:15.154 --> 03:19.325
- It's the bank president's address.
- And he lives right near here.

03:19.492 --> 03:23.371
Come on. Let's take the guard
to his house and get some help.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.584
You did the proper thing by
bringing the guard to my house.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.294
He'll be fine when he wakes up.

03:30.461 --> 03:33.130
Thanks, Mr. Carswell.
We knew you'd be able to help.

03:33.297 --> 03:36.967
Speaking of help, the sheriff's out of
town and won't be back for hours.

03:37.134 --> 03:40.262
Tell me, were there any clues
to who did this?

03:40.429 --> 03:44.350
No, sir, but the guard handed us
this blank paper and mumbled:

03:44.683 --> 03:46.769
"The flame will tell the Creeper."

03:46.936 --> 03:50.272
- Like, who is this Creeper, anyways?
- Yeah. Who?

03:50.439 --> 03:52.608
The Creeper is a
mysterious figure...

03:52.775 --> 03:54.855
that's been robbing our bank
in the dead of night.

03:54.944 --> 04:00.199
And each time, the doors and windows
are still locked from the inside.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.368
Then how does he do it?

04:02.535 --> 04:06.038
He's a phantom, a phantom
that can walk right through walls.

04:07.373 --> 04:10.543
Well, phantom or no phantom,
we got a date at the barn dance.

04:10.960 --> 04:15.089
Why don't you kids run along?
I'll take care of everything.

04:28.769 --> 04:32.148
This is a groovy dance floor,
isn't it, Velma?

04:32.314 --> 04:36.444
Yeah. Why don't you try dancing
on it instead of my feet?

04:36.610 --> 04:39.071
May I butt in?

04:40.698 --> 04:45.411
Well, I've been a wallflower before,
but this is ridiculous.

04:45.786 --> 04:49.039
Hey, Scoob, look.
Buffet table at 3:00.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.833
Are you with me?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.334
I'm with you!

04:53.919 --> 04:56.505
Mm, my favorite snack.

04:57.673 --> 05:00.718
Corn on the cob
a la chocolate syrup.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.307
Mm, boy.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.699
- What's that?
- What happened to the lights?

05:23.866 --> 05:25.242
Oh, my goodness!

05:25.451 --> 05:26.952
Zoinks!
What happened?

05:27.119 --> 05:29.788
Cool it, gang.
It's only a power failure.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.583
But-But What about our dance?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.545
Velma's right. This creepy
old barn is no fun in the dark.

05:36.712 --> 05:39.590
I got an idea. Let's all meet back
at the malt shop.

05:39.757 --> 05:41.675
We can continue
our party from there.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.303
Yeah. That's a good idea.
Let's go.

05:44.470 --> 05:47.431
Scooby and I will head up
the cleanup committee.

05:47.598 --> 05:50.976
- We will?
- Clean up the food, that is.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.318
See you at the malt shop!

06:00.277 --> 06:03.405
Shaggy! Scooby!
Hurry it up in there.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.282
We'll be right out!

06:05.449 --> 06:08.577
Okay, Scoob.
On your mark, get set...

06:08.744 --> 06:10.162
go!

06:13.040 --> 06:15.834
Pretty good cleanup job,
if I do say so myself.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.044
Yeah.

06:18.087 --> 06:20.756
Now we take these
paper plates out back.

06:22.341 --> 06:25.928
We can dump them by
that ugly scarecrow, Scoob.

06:32.768 --> 06:35.020
Zoinks! He's for real!

06:35.187 --> 06:37.273
Gangway!

06:41.443 --> 06:44.321
Oh, what's keeping those two?

06:44.488 --> 06:45.781
Help!

06:48.701 --> 06:52.955
- Velma, are you all right?
- I will be as soon as I find my glasses.

06:53.289 --> 06:54.999
Hey, what got into you two?

06:55.249 --> 06:56.917
What were you running from,
anyhow?

06:58.544 --> 06:59.587
Him!

07:07.553 --> 07:10.973
- What's that?
- That must be the Creeper!

07:11.390 --> 07:13.726
<i>Paper'.</i>

07:13.892 --> 07:16.312
<i>Paper'.</i>

07:16.478 --> 07:19.189
I think he wants that paper
the guard gave us.

07:19.356 --> 07:22.943
And I think it's time to leave.
Everybody, run!

07:26.113 --> 07:29.867
What's going on around here?
Run from what?

07:31.201 --> 07:33.287
There. That's better.

07:34.997 --> 07:36.749
<i>Paper'.</i>

07:36.915 --> 07:38.500
<i>Paper'.</i>

07:39.251 --> 07:41.420
Wait for me!

07:41.879 --> 07:43.756
<i>Paper'.</i>

07:43.922 --> 07:46.008
<i>Paper'.</i>

07:46.717 --> 07:49.011
Like, let's get out of here.

07:54.642 --> 07:55.768
<i>Paper'.</i>

08:08.656 --> 08:09.782
<i>Paper'.</i>

08:10.407 --> 08:11.784
Eek!

08:20.668 --> 08:22.127
<i>Paper'.</i>

08:22.544 --> 08:25.798
<i>Paper'.</i>

08:34.264 --> 08:36.141
<i>Paper'.</i>

08:36.308 --> 08:39.144
<i>Paper'.</i>

09:49.840 --> 09:52.301
Wow! What a crazy way
to make a getaway.

09:52.551 --> 09:54.428
But at least we ditched
the Creeper.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.143
Zoinks!
Doesn't he ever give up?

10:01.310 --> 10:03.854
Since we're chicken,
let's hide with the chickens.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.156
Huh?

10:14.364 --> 10:15.741
WheW!

10:15.908 --> 10:17.242
Is he gone?

10:17.993 --> 10:21.497
Wow! Any longer under here, and
my head would have hatched.

10:23.207 --> 10:27.461
Hey, speaking of hatching, looks like
that egg you sat on is hatching.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.257
Now you've done it, Scooby.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.927
That little chick thinks
you're his mother.

10:39.223 --> 10:41.350
You better set him straight.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.602
Okay. You:

10:45.479 --> 10:46.980
Me:

10:51.944 --> 10:53.570
Oh, great.
He thinks he's a dog.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.156
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy!

10:56.615 --> 10:58.735
Come on, Scoob. Let's see
if we can find the others...

10:58.784 --> 11:01.495
before the Creeper
finds us again.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.380
Wow! That was some wild ride.

11:11.547 --> 11:14.508
I'll say it was, but at least that
Creeper didn't get this paper.

11:14.675 --> 11:17.886
What's so important about a blank
piece of paper?

11:18.053 --> 11:21.515
There's only one way to find out:
Solve this mystery.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.476
Well, unless my glasses
deceive me...

11:24.643 --> 11:27.020
I think we've just found
our first clue.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.189
A car hidden in the bushes.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.191
Let's investigate.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.654
Did you find anything?

11:35.821 --> 11:37.990
Not even the registration slip.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.409
Hey, there's something
on the floor.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.327
What is it?

11:42.661 --> 11:45.330
Negatives. Torn-up negatives.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.666
And there's something strange
about them.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.877
Well, one thing isn't strange.

11:50.168 --> 11:54.047
Somebody doesn't want somebody
to see a picture of somebody.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.759
We'd better find Shaggy and Scooby.
Maybe they've found some Clues.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.178
That will be the day!

12:04.725 --> 12:06.351
Hey, Scoob,
can't you do something...

12:06.518 --> 12:10.022
- to get rid of your Chicken Little?
- Yeah! Yeah!

12:19.489 --> 12:21.158
Oh, no!

12:24.786 --> 12:27.789
Zoinks! Don't look now,
but company's coming!

12:32.586 --> 12:35.213
Head for the hills!

12:48.518 --> 12:49.853
Shh.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.415
Wait for me!

13:10.707 --> 13:12.376
No sign of Shag and Scooby yet.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.170
Shh, I hear someone coming.

13:15.379 --> 13:16.880
I bet it's the Creeper.

13:17.047 --> 13:19.383
Quick. Hide behind those trees.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.469
When I give the signal,
we'll all jump him.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.721
Ready? Now!

13:26.890 --> 13:29.393
We've got him!
We've got the Creeper.

13:30.727 --> 13:33.897
Correction: We've got Shaggy
and Scooby.

13:34.064 --> 13:35.941
I know whose back you're on...

13:36.108 --> 13:37.901
but whose side are you on?

13:39.653 --> 13:41.905
Sorry, guys. We thought
you were the Creeper.

13:42.197 --> 13:46.076
Like, who do you think we're running
from, this baby chick?

13:46.952 --> 13:49.121
You saw the Creeper? Where?

13:49.287 --> 13:51.581
There and there!

13:51.748 --> 13:53.417
And everywhere!

13:53.792 --> 13:57.129
According to Scooby, you've been
running into him all over the place.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.923
Hey, get a load of these footprints.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.092
It looks like he ran right past here.

14:02.259 --> 14:05.429
I'll bet those tracks lead us
straight to the Creeper.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.848
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.608
Couldn't we make better time
on the freeway?

14:18.984 --> 14:21.903
Oh, Shaggy, we're not
trying to make time.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.614
We're trying to make contact
with the Creeper.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.701
That's what I'm afraid of.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.787
The footprints end at this gorge.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.789
The Creeper must be in that cave.

14:33.165 --> 14:36.168
Look! A rope-and-plank bridge
over the gorge.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.462
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Like, what a shame.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.298
The planks have all been
rolled up for the night.

14:41.465 --> 14:43.383
Well, back to the old malt shop.

14:43.633 --> 14:47.054
Not so fast, Shaggy. Scooby
can Climb across the ropes...

14:47.220 --> 14:49.681
and mm" the planks for us.
Can't you, Scoob?

14:49.848 --> 14:52.434
- Uh-uh.
- Not even for a Scooby Snack?

14:54.102 --> 14:56.021
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's a deal.

15:04.780 --> 15:07.324
Go ahead, Scooby. A deal's a deal.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.042
Attaboy, Scooby!

15:22.339 --> 15:24.382
Go, Scooby! Go!

15:25.509 --> 15:27.844
- I knew Scoob could do it.
- He knew?!

15:28.011 --> 15:30.931
Is this trip necessary?

15:32.265 --> 15:35.185
Wow! What a spooky-looking cave.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.230
Like, we're in luck.
Nobody's home.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.359
Welcome to my cave.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.486
Who are you?

15:45.821 --> 15:47.531
I'm the hermit of the hills...

15:47.697 --> 15:50.992
and you're just in time
to join me for dinner.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.580
I just lost my appetite.

15:56.039 --> 15:59.084
But I insist. You must
stay for a while.

15:59.251 --> 16:02.587
- It isn't often I have visitors.
- I can see why.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.715
What do you think, girls?
He doesn't look like the Creeper.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.259
He looks worse.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.886
Well, that hermit disguise
doesn't fool me.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.555
I think he is the Creeper.

16:13.265 --> 16:17.144
Go on! Take a taste.
I insist.

16:18.436 --> 16:21.731
- You like?
- Yuck! What is it?

16:22.858 --> 16:25.235
It's the specialty
of the cave...

16:25.402 --> 16:29.239
squirrel stew with pickled
bat wings and crabgrass roots.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.575
Here, have some more.

16:31.867 --> 16:33.869
No, thanks.
I just remembered...

16:34.035 --> 16:35.912
I'm on a strict
squirrel-free diet.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.205
Me too!

16:37.706 --> 16:39.958
Come back!
Come back!

16:40.500 --> 16:42.961
Let's get out of here
while we still can.

16:45.046 --> 16:48.550
Come back!
Come back!

16:54.097 --> 16:55.557
Like, what do we do now?

16:55.724 --> 16:58.768
There's no doubt in my mind that
that hermit's the Creeper.

16:59.019 --> 17:02.105
Let's get back to the Mystery Machine
and go for the sheriff.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.984
Boy, am I glad we've seen the last
of that Creeper.

17:06.151 --> 17:07.319
Me too!

17:07.736 --> 17:08.778
The Creeper!

17:08.987 --> 17:10.405
Zoinks! It's him!

17:10.739 --> 17:12.657
<i>Paper'.</i>

17:12.824 --> 17:14.618
<i>Paper'.</i>

17:15.952 --> 17:17.954
Back to the barn!

17:18.997 --> 17:22.459
- Here we go again.
- Don't let him get that paper.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.085
<i>Paper'.</i>

17:26.671 --> 17:28.924
Uh-oh. Wrong turn.

17:29.090 --> 17:32.427
You wouldn't hit somebody
with glasses on, would you?

17:34.262 --> 17:35.722
OW!

17:47.192 --> 17:50.779
Help! Somebody, help!

17:50.946 --> 17:52.322
Help!

17:55.158 --> 17:59.829
Hey, watch it! Uh-oh.
Looks like I'm a goner. Oops!

18:01.373 --> 18:02.999
Sorry about that.

18:16.554 --> 18:20.433
- How do we get down from here?
- We jump! What else?

18:23.645 --> 18:25.730
- Watch it!
- Paper!

18:25.897 --> 18:27.315
Let go! That's not it!

18:27.607 --> 18:29.693
Take that, you Creeper!

18:30.694 --> 18:32.862
Scooby, do something!

18:35.198 --> 18:36.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.037
Zoinks!

18:49.212 --> 18:51.589
Nice work, Scooby.
You caught the Creeper.

18:52.007 --> 18:54.092
Now bail us out
of these hay bales.

18:54.259 --> 18:55.635
The Creeper?

19:00.473 --> 19:02.183
- Huh?
- Zoinks!

19:02.350 --> 19:05.687
It's Mr. Carswell,
the bank president.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.856
How about that!

19:08.857 --> 19:11.443
I got your message and went
to Carswell's house.

19:11.609 --> 19:15.113
He wasn't there, but I found the
bank guard tied up in the basement.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.408
Old Carswell had a pretty slick scheme
going for a while.

19:18.575 --> 19:22.871
I'll say. Since he was the last one
to leave the bank every day...

19:23.038 --> 19:25.165
<i>he would just fill his briefcase
with money...</i>

19:25.332 --> 19:28.918
<i>relock the safe, and leave
the bank as usual.</i>

19:29.544 --> 19:34.215
<i>Then, later that night, he would return
disguised as the Creeper...</i>

19:34.382 --> 19:38.219
<i>and make it appear that some sort of
a phantom was robbing the bank.</i>

19:38.386 --> 19:40.096
<i>However, unknown to Carswell...</i>

19:40.263 --> 19:42.766
<i>the guard installed a concealed
infrared camera...</i>

19:42.932 --> 19:45.226
<i>which took a picture of him
robbing the bank.</i>

19:45.393 --> 19:49.773
And then when he found out, he went
after the guard to get the pictures.

19:50.106 --> 19:54.152
And this is it. We told him about
this paper and after we left...

19:54.319 --> 19:56.154
he must have figured out
what it was.

19:56.321 --> 19:58.907
That's why he chased us
trying to get it.

19:59.074 --> 20:02.619
Watch. The flame will tell.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.792
- There's the Creeper.
- Well, I'll be.

20:09.209 --> 20:12.128
You kids have certainly wound up
all the loose ends.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.422
Blasted, meddling kids.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.884
Now that we're rid
of the Creeper...

20:18.051 --> 20:20.929
why don't we creep on down to
the malt shop and join the party?

20:21.096 --> 20:23.515
- Like, I'm ready.
- Me too!

20:25.433 --> 20:27.727
Hey, we got one passenger
too many.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.398
I think you'd better take him back
to his real mother, Scoob.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.321
Bye-bye!

20:49.749 --> 20:54.254
Oh, no! Scooby's become
a mother hen all over again.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.306
Shh!
