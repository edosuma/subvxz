Of course it's about money, Naomi.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.562
It's always-- Would you just explain? It's always-- Would you just explain?

17:00.646 --> 17:03.941
Since you're up to speed on thisand don't need my help,

17:04.483 --> 17:05.692
I'll return to work.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.240
[footsteps departing]

17:13.492 --> 17:15.327
[door closes] It's complicated.

17:15.410 --> 17:16.537
-I see that.-Yeah.

17:16.619 --> 17:19.080
Just focus on the deal.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.165
Make it happen.

17:20.665 --> 17:21.916
I intend to.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.880
[reporter, in Japanese] A crowdof 200,000 people has braved the weather

17:26.964 --> 17:30.926
to attend the funeral of the Emperor.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.263
[TV report continues]

17:34.346 --> 17:36.515
[Solomon, in English]You yelled at me once.

17:36.598 --> 17:39.184
-My first year.-Did you deserve it?

17:39.268 --> 17:40.853
Yeah, I deserved it.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.354
Good on you to admit it.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.982
We looked up to you, the guys in my year.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.026
That's the past tense I hear.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.820
That's not what I meant.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.531
Yeah, it's fine.I know how that talk goes.

17:52.614 --> 17:55.450
Who closed the biggest deal?

17:55.534 --> 17:58.161
Who's getting bumped to the 43rd floor?

17:58.245 --> 18:02.165
I admit,I used to do a lot of that talk myself. I admit,I used to do a lot of that talk myself.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.959
That's the past tense I hear.

18:10.340 --> 18:14.469
You wanna know how I got here?What the fuck happened?

18:14.970 --> 18:17.097
Yeah. I am curious.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.894
I got married.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.229
Popped out two kids.

18:24.313 --> 18:26.481
A place in the city and in the country.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.736
Before I knew it,the number of zeros on my check

18:30.819 --> 18:32.821
no longer felt like some game.

18:34.323 --> 18:37.201
It felt like fucking survival. [scoffs]

18:40.037 --> 18:40.954
So--

18:42.289 --> 18:44.291
[sighs] I made a few bad calls.

18:45.918 --> 18:49.213
Numbers start slipping,got anxious, made more bad calls.

18:49.296 --> 18:53.425
Meanwhile, my wife, Princeton degree,never worked a day in her life,

18:53.509 --> 18:56.053
she starts complainingthat I'm never home.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.722
Or when I am, I'm not really there.

[Tom sighs]

19:06.396 --> 19:07.731
[sighs]

19:07.814 --> 19:09.399
So one morning,

19:09.483 --> 19:12.694
I'm getting in my carto drive the 49 minutes to work,

19:12.778 --> 19:14.321
popping Visine in my eyes,

19:14.404 --> 19:16.949
she drops the news that she's leaving me.

19:17.032 --> 19:18.116
[inhales deeply]

19:19.743 --> 19:23.830
I tell her we'll talk about it,she says there's nothing to talk about.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.418
I ask her how could she throw awayten years of marriage.

19:28.502 --> 19:30.712
And she asks me how I didn't notice

19:30.796 --> 19:33.841
that she went from being a brunetteto a blonde.

19:33.924 --> 19:34.925
[chuckles]

19:35.008 --> 19:38.470
Yeah, my marriage got fucked.

19:38.554 --> 19:41.557
Then my career. And so, here I am.

19:46.103 --> 19:50.148
[employees speaking Japanese]

19:50.983 --> 19:52.943
[Tom] So Godzilla or Superman?

19:53.485 --> 19:57.072
Land of the Rising Sungonna topple Home of the Brave and Free?

19:57.155 --> 20:00.033
To be honest,the question doesn't interest me. To be honest,the question doesn't interest me.

20:00.576 --> 20:03.912
Are you fucking with me?It's your pay grade, Solomon.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.207
You have the Japanese buying dollars

20:07.291 --> 20:09.334
and the US taking deutsche marks

20:09.418 --> 20:12.045
and Germans hoarding sterling and so on.

20:12.129 --> 20:14.673
All it amounts to is money moving so fast

20:14.756 --> 20:17.342
that currencies become almost irrelevant.

20:17.426 --> 20:21.096
-Tell that to the currency floor.-Countries become irrelevant.

20:21.180 --> 20:22.848
What are you talking about?

20:22.931 --> 20:24.433
All that matters, really,

20:24.516 --> 20:27.477
is that your own tally defies gravity.

20:27.561 --> 20:29.229
So is that why you're here?

20:29.980 --> 20:31.106
To defy gravity?

20:31.815 --> 20:33.525
-[elevator bell dings]-[doors open]

20:51.376 --> 20:54.630
[technician, in Japanese]You do this with all the machines?

20:54.713 --> 20:56.131
Not me. Not anymore.

20:56.673 --> 20:59.218
We have a guy who comes in at night.

21:00.219 --> 21:02.262
But is this right?

21:03.722 --> 21:08.894
I asked the same thingwhen Mr Goto pulled the veil off my eyes.

21:08.977 --> 21:10.812
I was also your age.

21:12.272 --> 21:13.357
Adjusting the nails.

21:14.024 --> 21:15.943
Everyone does it.

21:16.777 --> 21:18.946
And you can't be the fool left out.

21:20.697 --> 21:25.035
Most people think if they can flickthe handle just right, they will win.

21:25.744 --> 21:29.289
But they have no controlover the outcome. Not really.

21:29.373 --> 21:30.916
And neither do we.

21:31.834 --> 21:36.129
Adjusting the nails doesn't fix the odds.We don't do that.

21:36.213 --> 21:38.841
We just give them a nudge.That's all this is.

21:39.716 --> 21:44.054
But "don't be greedy,"that's what Goto always said.

21:45.722 --> 21:48.767
When they lose, feel their heartache.

21:49.726 --> 21:52.521
When they win, feel their joy.

21:55.607 --> 21:58.235
Let's see how you did.

22:42.821 --> 22:45.490
Mr Bando, I have the loan documents.

22:46.491 --> 22:47.951
I have to attend to this.

22:53.624 --> 22:56.418
Please check all the numbers.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.630
400 million yen. That looks right.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.385
I will get this overto the bank right away.

23:05.469 --> 23:08.222
Do you expect any problems with the loan?

23:08.305 --> 23:10.015
Not at all.

23:10.098 --> 23:13.227
You can start building the propertyin a few weeks.

23:13.810 --> 23:14.937
Congratulations.

23:15.020 --> 23:16.730
Thank you so much. [chuckles]

24:20.169 --> 24:22.004
[Solomon, in English] So this--

24:23.297 --> 24:25.465
this tiny piece of shit land here.

24:29.178 --> 24:30.429
One billion.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.057
[both chuckle]

24:34.141 --> 24:35.601
Are you fucking kidding?

24:35.684 --> 24:38.562
She's turned down three offers.Enough foreplay.

24:38.645 --> 24:41.481
Give her an offershe can't possibly turn down.

24:43.859 --> 24:44.860

Five years ago, the rainmaker in youwouldn't even have hesitated.

24:51.158 --> 24:52.367
You know it's true.

[chuckles]

24:55.412 --> 24:57.915
Yeah. Fine. Fine, yeah.

25:01.752 --> 25:04.004
Wait. Aren't we going to talk to her?

25:04.087 --> 25:06.548
Yeah, but I'm not going in there with you.

Hi, ma'am,I don't have enough money today.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.982
Here you go. This is a gift from him.

25:24.066 --> 25:25.192
From who?

25:25.275 --> 25:27.402
From the new district fish broker.

25:27.486 --> 25:30.948
You know,the one the girls are all swooning over.

25:31.031 --> 25:32.407
I was surprised too.

25:33.033 --> 25:35.786
I don't know about Japan,but to do that here,

25:35.869 --> 25:38.288
it's just so shameless.

25:38.372 --> 25:42.292
-And to a good girl like you.-Ma'am, be careful with your words.

25:42.376 --> 25:43.710
I don't know this man.

25:43.794 --> 25:45.629
He's nothing to me.

Hey. Where are you off to?Looks like a heavy load.

26:19.955 --> 26:21.081
You're cute.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.584
Why don't I help you with that?

26:26.211 --> 26:30.007
Sorry, I don't understand.I have to catch my ferry.

26:30.090 --> 26:33.385
[in Japanese] Listen to that.Even their language sounds repulsive.

26:33.969 --> 26:35.304
What's in those bags?

26:35.387 --> 26:38.557
My mother will be worried. I have to go.

Stop that!

[Hansu] That if they bother you again,I'll kill them

28:27.416 --> 28:29.459
and feed their bodies to the dogs.

28:33.714 --> 28:35.757
I say it to put your mind at ease.

28:47.394 --> 28:50.063
I'd forgottenhow beautiful this country is,

28:51.148 --> 28:52.441
how resilient,

28:54.026 --> 28:55.485
and how strong.

29:07.039 --> 29:08.916
How long have you been gone?

29:10.042 --> 29:11.585
Fourteen years.

29:12.211 --> 29:14.588
I've been there almost longer than here.

29:30.479 --> 29:32.940
[ferry horn blows]

29:46.078 --> 29:48.205
Don't worry, I won't harm you.

29:53.043 --> 29:55.087
Will you throw this shirt away?

29:55.754 --> 29:56.922
Why would I do that?

30:01.593 --> 30:03.470
You're kind of an odd girl.

30:05.138 --> 30:09.142
Well, it wasn't me who was talking aboutfeeding people to dogs.

30:13.438 --> 30:18.694
You can bring it to the cove tomorrow.I'll wash it before lunch.

31:37.814 --> 31:41.527
Ma'am, I'm sorry to bother you,but I was hoping we could talk.

31:42.277 --> 31:43.529
What are you selling?

31:43.612 --> 31:44.780
Actually, I'm buying.

31:45.531 --> 31:47.241
-[laughs]-[chuckles]

31:47.324 --> 31:49.868
I guess those crooks must be desperate.

31:50.327 --> 31:52.412
Where'd they go to find one of you?

31:53.080 --> 31:54.915
I'm the one who went to them.

31:57.251 --> 31:58.627
Why would you do that?

32:02.297 --> 32:04.758
You're persistent, I'll give you that.

32:04.842 --> 32:06.093
This is for you.

32:07.511 --> 32:08.512
[grunts]

32:12.975 --> 32:15.602
[chuckles] They're grown in that shape.

32:16.436 --> 32:17.729
I'm sorry?

32:17.813 --> 32:21.316
Apparently, they taste awful.But they cost 9,000 yen.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.945
Nine thousand yen! You must be crazy.

32:28.907 --> 32:30.075
[grunts]

32:30.617 --> 32:31.994
Ma'am? Erm--

32:33.203 --> 32:36.874
In 1955, you bought this landfor a total of 4,000 yen.

32:38.417 --> 32:41.044
That's less than half the priceof this melon.

32:43.130 --> 32:44.590
If you agree to sell,

32:45.174 --> 32:47.092
we'll give you one billion yen.

32:59.521 --> 33:03.066
You speak Korean very well,that is for a young person. You speak Korean very well,that is for a young person.

33:03.650 --> 33:05.861
I lost some after I went to America.

33:08.322 --> 33:10.365
You are better than my kids.

33:12.868 --> 33:15.037
My husband died a few years back.

33:15.287 --> 33:18.207
[sighs]He didn't want them to learn that tongue.

33:19.583 --> 33:21.752
And now my own kids

33:21.835 --> 33:25.214
don't even know the languagein which their mother dreams.

33:26.548 --> 33:27.925
That must make you sad.

33:31.595 --> 33:33.180
Who taught Korean to you?

33:34.598 --> 33:36.099
My grandmother taught me.

33:38.936 --> 33:41.230
My mother died when I was young.

33:41.855 --> 33:44.900
My father worked long hours.

33:45.609 --> 33:47.611
My grandmother raised me.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.822
[sighs] I suppose she had a hard life too.

33:51.907 --> 33:53.617
[chuckles] Mmm.

33:54.368 --> 33:58.580
In order to feed her family,she worked day and night,

33:58.664 --> 34:01.250
pushing her cart, selling kimchi. pushing her cart, selling kimchi.

34:01.959 --> 34:04.753
-Her hands were burned---Enough of all that.

34:05.587 --> 34:07.756
What family hasn't suffered?

34:09.925 --> 34:11.260
Tell me something.

34:12.094 --> 34:13.971
When the old speak like this,

34:14.513 --> 34:16.264
isn't it tiresome?

34:18.934 --> 34:21.603
But isn't that precisely the point?

34:24.063 --> 34:25.858
To burden us with the past?

34:34.324 --> 34:37.494
Think of your children. Take the offer.

35:04.104 --> 35:05.689
Ever been to school?

35:06.148 --> 35:07.983
Can you read and write?

35:08.567 --> 35:12.863
My father fought for me to go,but my mother saw no point in it.

35:13.322 --> 35:14.573
That's a shame.

35:15.073 --> 35:16.825
With the right skills,

35:17.701 --> 35:19.995
you could've actually left this place.

35:20.078 --> 35:21.788
Why would I want that?

35:22.456 --> 35:26.043
This is my birthplace,the home of my parents.

35:26.126 --> 35:28.128
And is that the life for you?

35:33.842 --> 35:36.220
I didn't think my words would offend you.

35:37.137 --> 35:39.765
I know that I'm poor and ignorant.

35:39.848 --> 35:42.976
I'll never possess the fine thingsyou and Jiyun own,

35:43.060 --> 35:45.729
but that gives youno right to laugh at me.

35:46.522 --> 35:47.898
I won't allow it.

35:48.774 --> 35:50.025
I shouldn't be here.

35:50.108 --> 35:51.235
Oh, come on.

35:55.531 --> 35:57.658
I'm just asking if you have dreams.

35:58.575 --> 36:00.536
I was as poor as you once. I was as poor as you once.

36:02.746 --> 36:04.039
Poorer, even,

36:04.915 --> 36:06.375
believe it or not.

36:08.669 --> 36:11.505
Although, even then, I had my dreams.

36:12.214 --> 36:14.675
And I didn't let anyone take them from me

36:22.140 --> 36:23.225
[sighs]

36:24.268 --> 36:25.477

36:25.561 --> 36:27.104
We're here in Yeongdo.

36:27.187 --> 36:28.355
[rock scrapes]

36:29.189 --> 36:30.274
This is Japan.

36:31.233 --> 36:32.651
Osaka here.

36:32.734 --> 36:34.319
That's where I live.

36:34.903 --> 36:36.989
There's nothing you can't get there.

36:39.616 --> 36:41.743
Sweet oranges from the Americas.

36:41.827 --> 36:43.620
Bananas from Taiwan.

36:43.704 --> 36:45.455
Beautiful candies from France.

36:46.540 --> 36:48.625
Almost every house has electricity.

36:48.709 --> 36:51.211
And plug-in heatersto keep warm in winter.

36:51.712 --> 36:54.339
Electric trains take youall over the city.

36:55.465 --> 36:58.218
And then at night,all the lights flash on,

37:00.429 --> 37:02.723
casting incredible reflections.

37:03.515 --> 37:04.975
It's a marvel, really.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.731
So imagine if Osaka has all of that,

37:11.773 --> 37:13.984
what does the rest of the world offer?

37:16.361 --> 37:17.905
[rock scrapes]

37:17.988 --> 37:18.989
Manchuria.

37:19.072 --> 37:20.490

37:23.285 --> 37:24.411

37:25.078 --> 37:26.830
And halfway around the world--

37:33.086 --> 37:34.129
America.

37:46.475 --> 37:47.809
I went there once.

37:56.276 --> 37:57.694
How was it there?

38:01.073 --> 38:04.660
[in English] Everything. And nothing.

38:13.919 --> 38:15.671
Tell me what you see.

38:25.973 --> 38:27.808
You say this is Japan?

38:29.309 --> 38:30.894
And this is us?

38:34.189 --> 38:35.399
Interesting.

38:35.482 --> 38:37.234
[chuckles] What is?

38:38.235 --> 38:39.444
I guess…

38:41.154 --> 38:44.199
I always imagined themto be so much bigger than us.

38:45.450 --> 38:48.078
Like a huge mouth ready to swallow.

38:49.872 --> 38:51.623
So what does this tell you?

38:54.376 --> 38:56.628
That doesn't have to be our fate.

38:59.339 --> 39:01.258
I believe we can beat them. I believe we can beat them.

39:14.062 --> 39:15.314
Sunja,

39:18.400 --> 39:21.528
I'd like to come back.While you're doing laundry.

39:24.031 --> 39:25.115
Can I do that?

39:34.374 --> 39:35.876
Mmm. [chuckles]

39:38.504 --> 39:42.299
-[people on TV speaking and laughing]-[Kyunghee chuckling]

39:50.807 --> 39:53.143
[chuckling]

40:09.743 --> 40:12.412
They tasted a bit different today.

40:15.666 --> 40:18.001
-They were bitter.-[inhales sharply]

40:26.760 --> 40:28.554
The other day you mentioned Jiyun.

40:29.054 --> 40:30.055
Why?

40:30.556 --> 40:31.849
I shouldn't have.

40:32.599 --> 40:35.978
It's not right to blame herfor what I don't have.

40:36.520 --> 40:37.521
Why wouldn't you?

40:38.689 --> 40:40.941
She didn't earn any of it herself.

40:41.859 --> 40:45.529
But Jiyun and her kindare in for a harsh awakening.

40:46.697 --> 40:47.906
Why?

40:47.990 --> 40:50.868
Her father owes tax money on his estate.

40:50.951 --> 40:53.287
So any time now they'll take his land.

40:54.079 --> 40:56.999
No one deserves to havewhat is theirs taken away.

40:57.583 --> 40:59.626
You sound as foolish as the rest.

40:59.710 --> 41:01.879
Don't you have any loyalty? Don't you have any loyalty?

41:02.462 --> 41:03.463
I don't.

41:04.006 --> 41:07.718
Neither should you.People are rotten everywhere you go.

41:08.343 --> 41:09.428
Well then--

41:11.305 --> 41:12.723
why are you here

41:13.932 --> 41:15.642
if Japan is your home now?

41:17.227 --> 41:19.479
When I was young, I left empty-handed.

41:19.563 --> 41:22.191
I wanted to return now that I'm successful

41:24.526 --> 41:26.820
and see if the shadow I left behind

41:27.696 --> 41:29.865
was still here waiting for me.

41:30.616 --> 41:32.326
I realize that's foolish.

41:32.409 --> 41:34.786
So is it still here, that shadow?

41:47.049 --> 41:48.300
What are you doing?

41:50.385 --> 41:51.887
When I was a boy,

41:51.970 --> 41:54.973
my father and I each ownedjust one suit of clothes.

41:55.474 --> 41:59.144
Every night, I did the washand hung them out overnight.

41:59.228 --> 42:01.772
We put them on still damp in the morning. We put them on still damp in the morning.

42:02.314 --> 42:03.732
One time,

42:03.815 --> 42:08.529
I got the brilliant idea to put themnear the fire to speed up the drying.

42:10.239 --> 42:12.574
I turned my attention to cooking supper.

42:14.076 --> 42:15.661
I can still see it.

42:16.662 --> 42:20.749
You have to keep stirring the barleyso the pot won't burn.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.502
Stirring it, I smelled something.

42:23.585 --> 42:25.212
When I ran outside,

42:25.712 --> 42:26.797
I found a hole

42:28.298 --> 42:30.551
this bigin the sleeve of my father's suit.

42:31.260 --> 42:33.887
Burned right through. [chuckles]

42:36.056 --> 42:38.600
He was real angry that night. [sighs]

42:41.186 --> 42:43.647
So where is your father now?

42:46.817 --> 42:48.068
He's gone now.

42:48.819 --> 42:50.362
Long forgotten.

43:20.976 --> 43:22.936
[Donghee]How is there so much rain in the world?

43:24.354 --> 43:26.064
And why fall on Yeongdo?

43:27.399 --> 43:28.734
Why not Seoul?

43:28.817 --> 43:29.818
Or Japan?

43:30.402 --> 43:32.654
Huh? Or China?

43:35.616 --> 43:36.742

Come here and help us.

44:02.809 --> 44:06.230
otherwise I would have something for you.

44:07.564 --> 44:08.982
So, nothing then?

44:11.818 --> 44:14.446
[whimpers] But there has to be something.

44:14.530 --> 44:15.989
Anything!

44:16.949 --> 44:19.409
Nothing of use to you.

44:26.708 --> 44:28.877
Etsuko, wait for me in my car.

44:29.461 --> 44:31.046
I'll handle the payment.

44:31.129 --> 44:35.592
I knew I shouldn't have expected anythingbut our money going down the drain.

44:36.552 --> 44:39.179
-Leave it to me.-[sighs]

44:41.098 --> 44:43.016

44:51.233 --> 44:52.484

Where have you been?

47:20.674 --> 47:22.176
What boring questions.

47:23.051 --> 47:26.263
Ask me, instead, if I'm still beautiful.

47:28.265 --> 47:29.766
Are you still beautiful?

47:31.351 --> 47:32.811
If I close my eyes,

sometimes I can still see the two of us.
