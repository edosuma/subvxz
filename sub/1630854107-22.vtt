WEBVTT

00:06.840 --> 00:08.550
McGEE:
Looks like our killer
was doing some research

00:08.750 --> 00:10.360
on Russia before
the victim showed up.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.360
Global chaos, revenge...

00:12.560 --> 00:14.360
was pretty much all Yuri
ever talked about.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.200
McGEE:
NCIS, come out of the shower.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.260
Yuri.

00:17.460 --> 00:18.530
You know his mission?

00:18.730 --> 00:20.730
Something that falls into
the category

00:20.930 --> 00:23.370
of weapons of mass destruction.

00:23.570 --> 00:26.210
VANCE:
<i>But Yuri is more than happy</i>
<i>to go to prison,</i>

00:26.410 --> 00:28.420
<i>taking his secrets with him.</i>

00:30.930 --> 00:32.250
(buzzer sounds)

00:32.450 --> 00:34.630
(man speaking indistinctly
over speakers)

00:35.800 --> 00:37.500
Oh.

00:38.370 --> 00:39.950
Better not be overcooked
this time.

00:40.150 --> 00:41.420
It's not.

00:41.620 --> 00:43.840
Hey, hey,
you forgetting something?

00:46.940 --> 00:48.260
MAN (over speakers):
Key block on the gate.

00:48.460 --> 00:49.560
Thank you, Otis.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.030
(buzzer sounds)
(inmates whistling)

00:51.230 --> 00:53.200
(cell doors rattling)
(indistinct shouting)

00:53.400 --> 00:55.620
(inmates shouting, whistling)

00:56.790 --> 00:58.570
(whistling)
(rattling)

00:58.770 --> 01:02.060
(shouting continues)

01:04.190 --> 01:06.450
(man shouts in Spanish)
(whistling continues)

01:06.650 --> 01:07.880
I said no new neighbors.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.150
There's nothing I can do
about it, man.

01:10.350 --> 01:11.550
There's overcrowding
on every block.

01:11.750 --> 01:13.690
I kept that cell empty
as long as I could.

01:13.890 --> 01:15.020
I'm sorry, Yuri.

01:15.220 --> 01:18.040
Not as sorry as you will be
if he snores.

01:19.540 --> 01:21.780
(man speaking indistinctly
over speakers)

01:22.650 --> 01:24.710
You hear that, my friend?

01:26.050 --> 01:28.420
You better hope
you do not snore.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.960
* *

02:04.290 --> 02:09.190
Thanks for the update, Warden.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.680
How's Torres doing?

02:11.880 --> 02:13.080
Made it
through the night.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.650
Any contact with Yuri yet?

02:14.850 --> 02:16.320
Knowing Torres, he was
probably trying to get intel

02:16.520 --> 02:18.420
about the terrorist attack
the moment he got there.

02:18.620 --> 02:20.950
He'll certainly have
his opportunities.

02:21.150 --> 02:23.620
He's in the cell
directly across from Yuri.

02:23.820 --> 02:24.990
Isn't that a little risky?

02:25.190 --> 02:26.360
VANCE:
Yes, it is.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.860
Whole op is risky,
not to mention rushed.

02:29.060 --> 02:30.260
We know, but given
the circumstances,

02:30.460 --> 02:31.630
there was
no other option.

02:31.830 --> 02:33.030
Which is why I approved it,

02:33.230 --> 02:34.700
but it doesn't mean
I'm happy about it.

02:34.900 --> 02:37.440
His cover identity was thrown
together way too quickly.

02:37.640 --> 02:38.940
We've combed through it,
Director,

02:39.140 --> 02:41.110
and it seems... solid.

02:41.310 --> 02:43.810
Emmanuel "Manny" Delgado, 38,

02:44.010 --> 02:45.540
serving ten years
for armed robbery.

02:45.740 --> 02:47.250
All prior arrests,
bank accounts,

02:47.450 --> 02:49.380
and addresses have been fully
vetted and backstopped.

02:49.580 --> 02:51.480
VANCE: He didn't have much time
to memorize it all.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.900
He's a quick study.
Well, he better be.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.190
Is the warden our only
point of contact?

02:56.390 --> 02:57.320
Yeah.
(sighs)

02:57.520 --> 02:58.320
Not even
the prison guards know

02:58.520 --> 02:59.760
that Torres is undercover.

02:59.960 --> 03:01.860
So if things go sideways,
he's on his own in there.

03:02.060 --> 03:03.560
McGEE: Yes, but we
have eyes on him.

03:03.760 --> 03:07.030
Kasie got approval to wire into
the prison security cameras.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.570
KNIGHT: Plus, we've been
authorized to activate

03:08.770 --> 03:10.900
the prison's alarm
in case of an emergency.

03:11.100 --> 03:13.110
All right, now that
we've got Yuri covered,

03:13.310 --> 03:14.870
what do we know
about his father?

03:15.070 --> 03:17.030
Kostya Valkov.

03:17.960 --> 03:20.080
Ex-KGB, current oligarch,

03:20.280 --> 03:21.410
he has close ties with both

03:21.610 --> 03:23.280
the Russian mafia
and the Kremlin.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.350
We believe he's the mastermind
behind the impending attack.

03:26.550 --> 03:27.690
Do we know
his whereabouts?

03:27.890 --> 03:30.520
He's safely insulated
in his Moscow compound.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.660
We can't get to him,

03:31.860 --> 03:32.960
which is why
we're going after his son.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.290
So it's Yuri or bust.
Maybe not.

03:35.490 --> 03:37.160
Remember Evelyn Shaw?

03:37.360 --> 03:39.700
One of the four Russian
spies tied to Kostya.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.100
Didn't you take a run at her
already and get nowhere?

03:42.300 --> 03:43.840
Yeah, but her
circumstances

03:44.040 --> 03:45.170
recently changed.

03:45.370 --> 03:46.540
Her bunkmate tried to
kill her last night.

03:46.740 --> 03:48.270
We think Kostya ordered
the hit.

03:48.470 --> 03:50.680
And it turns out that
Yuri went to go visit Evelyn

03:50.880 --> 03:52.180
in prison two weeks ago.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.910
And we know that
Yuri likes to talk a lot,

03:55.110 --> 03:56.150
and maybe he said too much.

03:56.350 --> 03:57.520
Which would make her
a loose end

03:57.720 --> 03:59.390
that, uh, Kostya
would want tied up.

03:59.590 --> 04:02.770
If she knows something,
offer her a sweetheart deal.

04:03.970 --> 04:05.540
Get her to talk.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.510
(man speaking indistinctly
over speakers)

04:14.320 --> 04:16.800
(knocking rhythmically)

04:17.000 --> 04:19.250
(bell rings in distance)

04:22.630 --> 04:24.140
Can I help you?

04:24.340 --> 04:27.950
You don't talk much,
do you... Delgado?

04:28.150 --> 04:29.880
Best way to get by in here.

04:30.080 --> 04:31.680
You do not snore either.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.150
That's good.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.220
So far, I have
no complaints.

04:35.420 --> 04:37.090
Wish I could say
the same about you.

04:37.290 --> 04:39.160
You were sawing logs
all night.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.640
(chuckles)

04:41.580 --> 04:43.300
Do you know
who you're talking to?

04:43.500 --> 04:46.580
Mm-hmm.
A guy with, uh, sleep apnea?

04:48.280 --> 04:50.770
Get it under control.

04:50.970 --> 04:53.290
Or I'll control it for you.

04:57.660 --> 04:59.700
(laughing)

05:02.670 --> 05:04.680
You know,
you have big, uh...

05:04.880 --> 05:05.920
Mangoes?

05:06.120 --> 05:07.220
Yes.

05:07.420 --> 05:09.670
Well, finally something
we could agree on.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.240
I think I like you.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.480
I hope you don't make me
change my mind.

05:17.910 --> 05:19.700
And what would happen if you do?

05:19.900 --> 05:21.850
Ask around, my friend.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.540
You got a death wish, bro?

05:31.740 --> 05:33.450
I appreciate
you looking out,

05:33.650 --> 05:35.250
but I can
take care of myself.

05:35.450 --> 05:36.650
Ain't no one looking out
for your well-being.

05:36.850 --> 05:38.420
I was only sitting,
like, three feet away,

05:38.620 --> 05:40.570
and I ain't trying to get
caught up in no beatdowns.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.870
Them Russian boys
don't play.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.430
Hi again, Evelyn.
How you doing?

05:52.630 --> 05:55.730
Oh, I've been better.
Mm, yeah.

05:55.930 --> 05:57.700
Heard you had a rough
go of it last night.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.610
What happened?
My bunkie tried
to kill me.

06:00.810 --> 06:02.610
Oh. Well, that's
not very good.

06:02.810 --> 06:05.480
No. It is not.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.250
Why do you think she attacked
you out of the blue like that?

06:08.450 --> 06:09.950
Maybe she's just mean.

06:10.150 --> 06:13.190
I think Kostya Valkov
paid her to get rid of you

06:13.390 --> 06:15.050
because you know too much.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.360
I'm not gonna
talk about Kostya.
Why?

06:17.560 --> 06:19.630
Because he'll have me killed
if I do.

06:19.830 --> 06:21.660
Oh, he'll have you killed
regardless.

06:21.860 --> 06:24.480
As soon as you go back to the
prison, you're as good as dead.

06:25.580 --> 06:27.000
But you already know that.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.220
You're mean, too.

06:30.550 --> 06:33.690
Have you ever heard of the
Witness Protection Program?

06:34.690 --> 06:36.840
You... you can
get me in that?

06:37.040 --> 06:38.240
Mm.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.850
Arrangements have
already been made.

06:40.050 --> 06:42.280
All you have to do is tell me
whatever it is you know

06:42.480 --> 06:44.280
about the attack that
Kostya's planning.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.820
I'll get my own house?

06:46.020 --> 06:48.190
Some-someplace where
Kostya can never find me?

06:48.390 --> 06:50.420
A beautiful cottage
in Culpeper.

06:50.620 --> 06:52.160
Pickleball capital of Virginia.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.630
Pickleball?

06:53.830 --> 06:55.630
Everyone loves pickleball.
Even Russian spies.

06:55.830 --> 06:57.630
First, you-you have
to understand

06:57.830 --> 06:59.900
that what I'm about to tell you
I had nothing to do with

07:00.100 --> 07:02.420
at all...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Skip ahead.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.140
Yuri visited me
a couple weeks ago.

07:06.340 --> 07:09.240
He was bragging about
some really

07:09.440 --> 07:11.940
huge attack that
his father was planning.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.050
When is it happening?
I don't know
the exact day,

07:15.250 --> 07:16.420
but very soon.

07:16.620 --> 07:19.180
He said the wheels
are already in motion.

07:19.380 --> 07:20.590
And what else did he say?

07:20.790 --> 07:23.620
That-that's it.
(sighs) I swear.

07:23.820 --> 07:25.320
Okay, you can't
possibly think

07:25.520 --> 07:27.290
that you're gonna get
a free home

07:27.490 --> 07:30.280
and lifelong pickleball
with just that.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.170
Wait. Wait,
you-you can't send me

07:34.370 --> 07:35.570
back to prison--
I'll be killed.

07:35.770 --> 07:37.140
Oh, that's not my problem.

07:37.340 --> 07:40.010
Please, Agent Knight,
I told you everything I know.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.670
Besides,
can't the undercover agent

07:41.870 --> 07:44.930
you have in Yuri's prison
figure the rest out?

07:50.430 --> 07:51.850
What makes you think we have

07:52.050 --> 07:53.720
an undercover agent
in with Yuri?

07:53.920 --> 07:56.690
One of my guards
is on Kostya's payroll.

07:56.890 --> 07:58.490
Said there's a Fed
in Yuri's prison,

07:58.690 --> 08:01.540
which means there might be
one in mine, too.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.230
If Evelyn knows
about Torres...

08:05.430 --> 08:07.350
It's likely Yuri does, too.

08:08.420 --> 08:09.670
Get his ass out of there.

08:09.870 --> 08:11.520
Now.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.430
How old are you, man?

08:26.670 --> 08:28.990
18 last month. Why?

08:29.190 --> 08:31.810
Damn, you're barely
old enough to drive.

08:33.510 --> 08:34.590
Why are you in here?

08:34.790 --> 08:35.830
Long story.

08:36.030 --> 08:38.200
Oh, okay, sorry,
you got someplace to be?

08:38.400 --> 08:40.220
(chuckles)

08:41.880 --> 08:44.070
(clears throat)
I got, uh, pinched for fraud.

08:44.270 --> 08:46.170
But I didn't do it.
Oh, of course
you didn't.

08:46.370 --> 08:47.340
Didn't you know

08:47.540 --> 08:48.410
that everyone
here is innocent?

08:48.610 --> 08:49.780
No, no, for real, bro.

08:49.980 --> 08:52.780
Look, I-I was, I was, like,
set up or something.

08:52.980 --> 08:56.130
I woke up to cops
busting down my door and...

09:06.140 --> 09:08.390
(chuckles) I don't think
your pal likes me.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.330
I don't
understand why.

09:10.530 --> 09:12.380
I'm friend to everyone.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.730
Except for rats.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.900
(sniffing)

09:18.100 --> 09:19.170
Do you smell that, Delgado?

09:19.370 --> 09:22.120
No, the only thing
I smell is him.

09:23.690 --> 09:24.810
I believe I once read

09:25.010 --> 09:27.910
in your <i>National Graphic</i>
magazine that

09:28.110 --> 09:29.780
rats cannot smell
their own scent.

09:29.980 --> 09:32.320
Oh, what a cute little nugget
of information.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.070
Isn't it?

09:36.970 --> 09:38.420
Did I say that you could sit?

09:38.620 --> 09:40.660
No. You did not.

09:40.860 --> 09:42.630
(phone buzzing)

09:42.830 --> 09:44.810
Pardon me.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.100
(tsking)
No, no, no, no, my friend.

09:50.300 --> 09:53.110
It is very rude to look at
someone else's texts.

09:53.310 --> 09:54.710
I wasn't looking at
your texts.

09:54.910 --> 09:57.780
I was wondering how you
smuggled a phone into prison.

09:57.980 --> 10:00.530
A little gift?
From your daddy?

10:01.530 --> 10:03.020
So you do know who I am.

10:03.220 --> 10:04.380
All you do is talk about

10:04.580 --> 10:06.550
how special you are,
and how your dad is this

10:06.750 --> 10:07.950
big Russian mobster,

10:08.150 --> 10:09.820
who I've never
even heard of.

10:10.020 --> 10:12.160
That may change very soon.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.360
Another little
special nugget.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.730
You prefer me to be
more direct with you?

10:16.930 --> 10:19.780
I know that there is a rat
in this prison.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.700
And I'm sensing
that rat is you.

10:22.900 --> 10:25.120
What did you just say?

10:26.020 --> 10:27.860
Sit down, rat.

10:28.860 --> 10:30.140
Oh, you do talk.

10:30.340 --> 10:32.280
I thought you just stood there
like a big bitch.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.210
(grunting)

10:34.410 --> 10:35.310
Ow!

10:35.510 --> 10:37.120
If you ever call me
a rat again,

10:37.320 --> 10:39.180
you're next.
(man groaning)

10:39.380 --> 10:42.240
And your daddy is not
going to save you.

10:45.110 --> 10:47.160
Delgado,
you got a visitor!

10:47.360 --> 10:48.630
(man crying)

10:48.830 --> 10:50.000
(sniffling)

10:50.200 --> 10:51.700
OTIS:
The hell happened here?

10:51.900 --> 10:54.330
(man grunting)

10:54.530 --> 10:55.970
He slipped.

10:56.170 --> 10:58.550
Delgado, lawyer's here,
let's go.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.160
We will finish our chat later.

11:06.130 --> 11:07.480

11:07.680 --> 11:09.780
MAN (over speakers):
Visitor for Emmanuel Delgado

11:09.980 --> 11:12.200
window 27.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.510
(knocking)

11:20.380 --> 11:22.480
(bell ringing)

11:26.680 --> 11:28.080
(bangs)

11:30.920 --> 11:31.800
What are you doing here?

11:32.000 --> 11:32.940
Pulling you out.

11:33.140 --> 11:34.770
What? No, you're not.

11:34.970 --> 11:36.810
We think Yuri knows
that there's a...

11:37.010 --> 11:39.140
A rat? Yeah,
I'm getting that vibe.

11:39.340 --> 11:40.980
What happened?
Did he come at you?

11:41.180 --> 11:42.610
Yeah, and he wasn't
subtle either.

11:42.820 --> 11:45.380
But, uh... I think
I bought myself some time.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.620
How?
I beat the crap out of
his muscle.

11:47.820 --> 11:50.760
Big bastard and mean as hell
but I think it's a good plan.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.180
Really?
Well, I said good plan,
not perfect plan.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.230
The rules are different
around here, Parker.

11:57.430 --> 11:59.230
Yuri accused me of
being a rat

11:59.430 --> 12:01.700
and only a rat
would take that lying down.

12:01.900 --> 12:04.470
So I did what I had to do.
So, you're thinking
that fighting

12:04.670 --> 12:06.570
maybe convinced him
that you're not the rat?

12:06.770 --> 12:09.370
No, but it's a step
in the right direction.

12:09.570 --> 12:12.640
Now, convincing him,
that's gonna take more time.

12:12.850 --> 12:14.280
You don't have it.
Says who?

12:14.480 --> 12:16.780
Says Vance.
He's pulling the plug.

12:16.980 --> 12:19.920
MAN (over speakers):
Visitor for Reymundo De Leon,
window 24.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.440
Manny.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.390
You hearing me, Delgado?

12:29.590 --> 12:32.160
Yeah, yeah, I hear you,
but I'm not leaving.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.930
There's too much
at stake.

12:34.130 --> 12:35.370
And Yuri doesn't know
it's me.

12:35.570 --> 12:37.340
Even still, he knows
there's a mole now

12:37.540 --> 12:39.340
which means the chance of
getting any intel

12:39.540 --> 12:40.710
is slim and none.

12:40.910 --> 12:43.640
BX9-3-10-64.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.540
It's the serial number
to a burner phone.

12:45.740 --> 12:49.280
Yuri has been texting someone,
probably daddy.

12:49.480 --> 12:51.020
BX9-31064.

12:51.220 --> 12:53.450
You know, you could've just
told me you had that

12:53.650 --> 12:56.390
as soon as you sat down.
Yeah, but what is
the fun of that?

12:56.590 --> 12:58.060
I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself.

12:58.260 --> 13:00.310
So, you'll talk to Vance?

13:01.910 --> 13:04.230
Hey, Parker...

13:04.430 --> 13:06.680
you're a hell of an attorney.

13:16.190 --> 13:19.240
(talking low, indistinctly)

13:19.440 --> 13:21.410
(buzzer sounds)
(knocking on door)

13:21.610 --> 13:22.850
Thank you, Judge.

13:23.050 --> 13:24.450
Please email that to me
as soon as you sign it.

13:24.650 --> 13:26.990
Yes, ma'am, trap warrant
is coming through as we speak.

13:27.190 --> 13:28.550
Okay, thank you.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.820
Phone company is sending over
a copy of every text

13:31.020 --> 13:33.890
Yuri's burn phone has sent
or received in the past week.

13:34.090 --> 13:35.390
We don't think
Yuri'd be dumb enough

13:35.590 --> 13:39.000
to discuss details of the terror
attack over text, do we?

13:39.200 --> 13:40.200
(computer chirping)

13:40.400 --> 13:41.730
Well, we are
about to find out.

13:41.930 --> 13:44.120
The logs from the phone company
just came through.

13:47.820 --> 13:49.040
Anyone speak Russian?

13:49.240 --> 13:51.660
Internet does.
Translating now.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.570
So, the text it's just
a series of numbers?

14:00.970 --> 14:02.120
Maybe it didn't
translate right.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.320
No, unfortunately, it did.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.090
The texts are all
written in code.

14:05.290 --> 14:06.090
Can you crack it?

14:06.290 --> 14:07.460
Do I have a choice?

14:07.660 --> 14:09.160
Not if we want
to save the country.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.060
In that case,
I better start.

14:11.260 --> 14:12.970

14:23.410 --> 14:25.480
Boss wants you
to write on this

14:25.680 --> 14:27.110
your full name,
date of your birth,

14:27.310 --> 14:29.780
and social security number.

14:29.980 --> 14:31.020
You're kidding, right?

14:31.220 --> 14:33.200
Also, name of school
you went to.

14:33.970 --> 14:36.590
For my master's
or my Ph.D.?

14:36.790 --> 14:37.990
You a doctor?

14:38.190 --> 14:40.990
Yeah, I got a doctorate on
boosting Brink's trucks.

14:41.190 --> 14:43.100
You're making joke.
Very funny.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.430
I'm not laughing.

14:44.630 --> 14:45.560
Please.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.570
We have to run
identity check.

14:47.770 --> 14:49.350
This no big deal.

14:50.620 --> 14:52.620
Unless, you have
something to hide.

14:56.290 --> 14:58.610
This is a waste of time,
if you ask me.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.110
I did not ask.

15:00.310 --> 15:03.080
And I bet there isn't even
a rat in here.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.820
That is wager
you would lose.

15:05.020 --> 15:06.250
Everybody knows in here

15:06.450 --> 15:07.950
that Yuri confessed to
murdering that dude.

15:08.150 --> 15:11.090
Mm, this is true.
Cops got them
dead to rights.

15:11.290 --> 15:13.830
He's already screwed.
Also true.

15:14.030 --> 15:18.810
So, why would the cops bother
putting an undercover in here?

15:20.220 --> 15:21.730
(chuckles)

15:21.930 --> 15:24.870
You all have something else
cooking in here, don't you?

15:25.070 --> 15:26.840
Nothing is cooking.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.820
Well, then there is no rat.

15:29.620 --> 15:32.110
We know for fact
there is.
How?

15:32.310 --> 15:35.530
Because we have
special source, Delgado.

15:36.330 --> 15:37.830
Let me guess?

15:43.140 --> 15:44.610
Yuri's daddy?

15:56.050 --> 15:58.640
There's nothing
more dangerous...

15:58.840 --> 16:00.690
than blind loyalty.

16:02.590 --> 16:06.830
When it comes to Kostya Valkov,
anything but loyalty is suicide.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.360
Russian made
surface-to-air missiles.

16:21.560 --> 16:24.600
Strike range, 25 kilometers

16:24.800 --> 16:26.730
with a warhead
up to 60 kilograms.

16:26.930 --> 16:29.500
(stops video)
That's Kostya Valkov
selling arms

16:29.700 --> 16:31.470
to a guy he thinks is
a member of Al-Qaeda,

16:31.670 --> 16:33.010
but who's actually MI5.

16:33.210 --> 16:34.840
How'd you get this?
I didn't.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.310
Ducky reached out to an
old connection for us.

16:37.510 --> 16:39.110
Dr. Mallard, good
to see you again.

16:39.310 --> 16:40.610
Likewise, Director.

16:40.810 --> 16:43.380
I just wish it weren't
under these circumstances.

16:43.580 --> 16:44.850
Yeah, you and me both.

16:45.050 --> 16:48.350
So, if this was an undercover
sting operation,

16:48.550 --> 16:50.220
how is Kostya not in prison?

16:50.420 --> 16:53.190
Oh, he was serving
a life sentence,

16:53.390 --> 16:56.590
but he was released
after a few years.

16:56.790 --> 16:59.800
Let me guess.
Another prisoner swap?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.230
Indeed.

17:01.430 --> 17:03.300
Which explains why Yuri
acts so untouchable.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.700
He thinks his father
can convince the Kremlin

17:05.900 --> 17:07.870
to make a swap
for him, too.
They may not need to.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.970
He might just walk right out
in the middle of the chaos.

17:10.180 --> 17:12.210
What are you
talking about?
McGEE: We cracked the code

17:12.410 --> 17:14.280
on Yuri and Kostya's texts.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.150
It's a numeric cypher

17:16.350 --> 17:19.280
based on a
Cold War era...
Tim.

17:19.480 --> 17:20.650
Right, doesn't matter.

17:20.850 --> 17:22.290
What matters is that
we have figured out

17:22.490 --> 17:24.220
how Kostya's planning
on attacking us.

17:24.420 --> 17:26.260
He's targeting
the U.S. power grid.

17:26.460 --> 17:28.640
Which sector?
All of them.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.100
His plan is to
knock out electricity

17:31.300 --> 17:32.330
to the whole country.

17:32.530 --> 17:33.470
We're talking
widespread outages

17:33.670 --> 17:34.970
for weeks, if not months.

17:35.170 --> 17:37.640
And how exactly is he
planning to pull this off?

17:37.840 --> 17:40.040
Could be a computer virus,
an electromagnetic pulse,

17:40.240 --> 17:41.340
even...

17:41.540 --> 17:43.480
small arms fire
at key substations.

17:43.680 --> 17:44.840
We're vulnerable to all of it.

17:45.040 --> 17:48.480
The DoD refers to
this kind of attack

17:48.680 --> 17:51.650
as a Black Sky event.

17:51.850 --> 17:53.350
And the simulations
that they've run,

17:53.550 --> 17:55.520
the potential consequences
are terrifying.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.590
We're talking complete
loss of communication,

17:57.790 --> 17:59.620
shutdown of all
the food supply chains,

17:59.820 --> 18:01.930
all critical infrastructures
grinding to a halt.

18:02.130 --> 18:05.980
Basically, a total breakdown
of society as we know it.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.820
(inmates chattering)

18:21.060 --> 18:23.650
You are dead man.
TORRES:
You really want to do this?

18:23.850 --> 18:26.180
'Cause it didn't work out
too well for you last time.

18:26.380 --> 18:27.720
YURI:
Not yet, Boris.

18:27.920 --> 18:30.390
I'd like to question him first
before you kill him.

18:30.590 --> 18:32.520
TORRES:
What do you want
to know now?

18:32.720 --> 18:34.460
My mother's maiden name?

18:34.660 --> 18:37.100
Why don't we start
with your name first?

18:37.300 --> 18:39.260
Oh, I see? You can't read.

18:39.460 --> 18:40.600
Emmanuel Del--

18:40.800 --> 18:42.270
Your real name.
That is my real name.

18:42.470 --> 18:44.500
And where do you claim
to have attended school?

18:44.700 --> 18:46.240
Saint Barnaby's in Miami.

18:46.440 --> 18:50.010
Which, if you bothered to look,
I wrote on your dumbass sheet.

18:50.210 --> 18:51.740
I did look.

18:51.940 --> 18:53.310
And I checked.

18:53.510 --> 18:56.250
Saint Barnaby's High
has no records of you.

18:56.450 --> 18:58.150
What does that
mean, Boris?

18:58.350 --> 19:00.400
It means
I get to kill him now.

19:01.770 --> 19:04.420
Or it means that
you two geniuses checked out

19:04.620 --> 19:05.660
the wrong school.

19:05.860 --> 19:08.530
There are two
Saint Barnaby's in Miami.

19:08.730 --> 19:11.600
I went to Saint Barnaby's
Reform School,

19:11.800 --> 19:14.100
not the Catholic
high school.

19:14.300 --> 19:15.470
Why should I trust this?

19:15.670 --> 19:16.700
You don't have to trust it.

19:16.900 --> 19:17.770
You can look it up
for yourself.

19:17.970 --> 19:19.270
He is lying, Yuri.

19:19.470 --> 19:22.410
I hope you're sure
because if you are not

19:22.610 --> 19:24.380
and you kill me...

19:24.580 --> 19:25.710
the real rat lives

19:25.910 --> 19:28.410
and your daddy will be
super pissed,

19:28.610 --> 19:29.910
don't you think?

19:30.110 --> 19:31.480
If you are lying to me,

19:31.680 --> 19:35.000
I'll make sure
Boris guts you slowly.

19:36.900 --> 19:39.510
Well, I'm not so sure
it's gonna play out that way.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.740
I guess we'll never know...

19:43.780 --> 19:45.810
...because I'm not lying.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.910
What's with the look,
McGee?
What look?

20:02.110 --> 20:04.320
The "refusing to blink until
you figure something out" look.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.650
I'm just trying to break down
what these latest texts

20:06.850 --> 20:08.690
between Yuri and Kostya
might mean.

20:08.890 --> 20:11.020
New texts?
Why didn't you tell me?

20:11.220 --> 20:13.660
I guess I was too busy
not blinking.

20:13.860 --> 20:15.530
Take a look at this--
Yuri texts his dad

20:15.730 --> 20:18.600
asking for an update on
something called "Anastasia."

20:18.800 --> 20:20.200
Kostya doesn't seem
too happy about it.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.300
Do you think Anastasia is
their code word for the attack?

20:23.500 --> 20:25.640
I'm not sure, but I don't think
we're gonna be getting

20:25.840 --> 20:27.940
too much more intel from
these text messages.

20:28.140 --> 20:29.840
Vance wants us all
up in MTAC.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.810
Who are we briefing?
CIA, DoD, NSA,

20:33.010 --> 20:35.480
and any other agency
with three letters.

20:35.680 --> 20:36.610
I called
the Department of Energy

20:36.810 --> 20:38.120
to warn them
about the attack.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.880
And?
Well, they said
even with the heads-up,

20:40.080 --> 20:41.350
there's no way
they could safeguard

20:41.550 --> 20:43.120
five million miles
of power lines.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.520
Lovely.
(sighs)

20:44.720 --> 20:45.960
(phone ringing)

20:46.160 --> 20:47.630
It's Torres.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.360
You go ahead,
tell Vance I'll be right in.

20:49.560 --> 20:52.560
WOMAN:
This is a collect call
from inmate Manny Delgado.

20:52.760 --> 20:55.300
Yeah, operator,
I'll, uh, I'll accept.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.870
Delgado, you okay?

20:57.070 --> 20:57.970
Yeah, for now.

20:58.170 --> 20:59.800
I need a favor, though.
Name it.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.870
Yuri knows Delgado didn't go to
Saint Barnaby's High in Miami.

21:03.070 --> 21:05.010
How? He get a hold
of a yearbook?

21:05.210 --> 21:06.210
I wouldn't doubt it.

21:06.410 --> 21:07.680
He's resourceful,
to say the least.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.050
I know you don't
want to hear this,

21:09.250 --> 21:10.520
but I think it's time
we pull you out...

21:10.720 --> 21:12.080
You're right,
I don't want to hear it.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.690
I told him there were
two Saint Barnaby's in Miami.

21:13.890 --> 21:15.290
Are there?
No.

21:15.490 --> 21:16.520
I made one up
and told him

21:16.720 --> 21:17.990
I went to the fake one--
a reform school.

21:18.190 --> 21:19.360
All right, so,
what do you want from us?

21:19.560 --> 21:20.530
To build you a school?

21:20.730 --> 21:22.030
No, I need a website.

21:22.230 --> 21:24.100
And make sure Delgado
is in the student records.

21:24.300 --> 21:25.500
I need it by 4:00.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.430
That's when the prison
turns the Wi-Fi on.

21:27.630 --> 21:28.800
Hang on, hang on.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.300
All right, thank you
so much, baby girl.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.240
I love you, too.
(smacks lips)

21:32.440 --> 21:33.860
(hangs up phone)

21:35.090 --> 21:36.520
(dial tone drones)

21:37.490 --> 21:40.780
KASIE:
we are barely going to make it
with this website.

21:40.980 --> 21:43.850
Uh, it is 3:57, by the way.

21:44.050 --> 21:45.920
I am aware of that, Jimmy.
I'm almost done.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.950
You just focus
on your job.
Right.

21:48.150 --> 21:51.090
Uh, okay, Yuri is still
in his cell reading.

21:51.290 --> 21:55.430
Uh, Torres is out in the yard
pumping iron. Naturally.

21:55.630 --> 21:58.230
Uh, Boris and Lev,

21:58.430 --> 21:59.430
they're in the cafeteria,

21:59.630 --> 22:00.700
drinking what appears
to be lemonade.

22:00.900 --> 22:03.470
Could be orange juice.
Jimmy, enough.

22:03.670 --> 22:04.970
I don't need the play-by-play.

22:05.170 --> 22:06.200
I'm nervous.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.670
I mean, Nick's life
basically depends on

22:07.870 --> 22:10.060
whether or not this
website passes muster.

22:11.430 --> 22:12.610
And it will,
'cause it's great.

22:12.810 --> 22:14.310
I mean, super legit.

22:14.510 --> 22:15.780
Okay, it might not be
perfect,

22:15.980 --> 22:17.480
but the prison's Wi-Fi
is about to turn on,

22:17.680 --> 22:19.120
so it'll have to do. Okay.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.220
Here goes nothing.
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

22:21.420 --> 22:24.420
Does that say a "reform school
for terrible kids"?

22:24.620 --> 22:25.590
Oh, yeah.
It's a placeholder.

22:25.790 --> 22:27.020
I couldn't think of
the right word.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.390
Troubled.
The word is "troubled."
Right.

22:28.590 --> 22:30.230
That's much better.

22:30.430 --> 22:32.230
Do you have any other
placeholders in there?

22:32.430 --> 22:33.670
Uh, I don't know.

22:33.870 --> 22:35.100
Do we have time to double-check?

22:35.300 --> 22:36.530
Uh...

22:36.730 --> 22:39.100
Yuri is still
in his cell, so yeah.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.610
The only computers
are in the library,

22:40.810 --> 22:42.690
that's on the other
wing of the...

22:44.530 --> 22:46.190
Uh-oh.

22:48.230 --> 22:49.410
A tablet?

22:49.610 --> 22:52.280
A guard is bringing
a tablet to his cell?

22:52.480 --> 22:55.390
What kind of a sorry excuse
for a prison is this?

22:55.590 --> 22:57.140
All right, publish it now, Kase.
Okay.

23:00.270 --> 23:01.260
Okay. We're live.

23:01.460 --> 23:03.230
Oh, God,
please let this work.

23:03.430 --> 23:04.760
(huffs softly)

23:04.960 --> 23:06.880
All right,
you got it, bro.
(whooshing)

23:09.780 --> 23:11.600
Nice.
(chuckles)

23:11.800 --> 23:13.100
You're jacked, Delgado.

23:13.300 --> 23:16.270
Especially
for an old dude.
(laughs)

23:16.470 --> 23:18.260
Thanks, I guess.

23:19.760 --> 23:22.550
Hey, that guy that
visited you yesterday?

23:22.750 --> 23:24.750
Yeah.
Who was that?

23:24.950 --> 23:28.120
That's, uh...
my mom's boyfriend.

23:28.320 --> 23:31.590
He's, uh, helping me out
with all the legal problems.

23:31.790 --> 23:32.960
Helping you out, huh?

23:33.160 --> 23:35.430
My mom said he's gonna
figure out who set me up.

23:35.630 --> 23:37.750
And how's that going?

23:39.050 --> 23:42.350
Honestly, I don't really
trust the dude.

23:44.390 --> 23:46.000
It kind of just seems
like our lives

23:46.200 --> 23:47.960
have gone to hell
since they met.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.240
Look, I know you think
I'm full of crap,

23:51.440 --> 23:53.080
but I really was framed, bro.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.080
I believe you.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.200
For real?

23:59.600 --> 24:01.240
How come?

24:02.740 --> 24:04.710
It's your turn.
Come on.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.110
Get after it.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.680
(grunts)

24:12.850 --> 24:14.170
JIMMY:
Is he on the website?

24:14.370 --> 24:15.670
Not yet.

24:15.870 --> 24:16.830
How will you know
when he's on?

24:17.030 --> 24:18.470
Because I'm the administrator.

24:18.670 --> 24:20.960
I'll be able to see every click.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.280
(computer beeping)
Oh. (sighs)

24:24.480 --> 24:25.830
He's on.

24:28.500 --> 24:31.320
Are reform schools allowed
to give out students' names?

24:31.520 --> 24:33.270
Uh. Saint Barnaby's is.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.090
JIMMY:
It worked.

24:35.290 --> 24:36.520
(chuckles)

24:36.720 --> 24:38.260
(ringing)

24:38.460 --> 24:40.960
Kasie, why did you put
a "Contact Us" tab on there?

24:41.160 --> 24:43.090
Now he's calling a
nonexistent school. I...

24:43.290 --> 24:45.230
Kasie, you...
(phone ringing)

24:45.430 --> 24:47.820
Oh, excuse me, Jimmy,
I should take this.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.940
Saint Barnaby's Reform School
for Boys.

24:51.140 --> 24:52.540
This is Sister Kasie speaking.

24:52.740 --> 24:54.990
How may I help you?

24:56.290 --> 24:58.310
(man speaking indistinctly
over speakers)

24:58.510 --> 25:00.480
(inmates chattering)

25:00.680 --> 25:02.860
You put M-80s
down the toilet?

25:04.670 --> 25:06.420
I phoned Saint Barnaby's.

25:06.620 --> 25:07.750
One of the nuns
remembered you.

25:07.950 --> 25:09.150
Sister Kah-see.

25:09.350 --> 25:10.620
Sister Kasie.

25:10.820 --> 25:12.220
Yeah, I remember her.

25:12.420 --> 25:14.590
She told me about the prank
you made on Father McGee.

25:14.790 --> 25:16.230
(laughing)

25:16.430 --> 25:17.760
Huge toilet explosion.

25:17.960 --> 25:21.530
Yeah, the other sisters didn't
think it was quite as funny.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.450
They made my life hell.

25:24.250 --> 25:26.790
Real sisters have a way
of doing that, too.

25:28.190 --> 25:30.270
My sister was horrible to me,

25:30.470 --> 25:31.840
but I had to take it

25:32.040 --> 25:34.460
because she was daddy's
little princess.

25:37.930 --> 25:39.420
So, we're good now?

25:39.620 --> 25:42.940
'Cause, if you'll trust me,
maybe we can work together.

25:43.870 --> 25:46.660
Okay.
Let's talk.

25:46.860 --> 25:48.160
KASIE:
Is it just me

25:48.360 --> 25:49.960
or does it actually look
like they're getting along?

25:50.160 --> 25:52.530
I mean, Yuri's smiling.
I think it worked.

25:52.730 --> 25:55.080
Wait. What's that?

25:56.380 --> 25:57.300
It's a shiv.

25:57.500 --> 25:58.640
What is he doing?

25:58.840 --> 26:00.150
Torres just proved
that he's not a rat.

26:01.090 --> 26:02.270
KASIE:
He's heading right to Nick.

26:02.470 --> 26:05.190
We got-we got to do something.
Um...

26:06.630 --> 26:09.030
Uh, this is all we can do.

26:10.330 --> 26:11.480
(alarm beeping)

26:11.680 --> 26:13.220
MAN (over speakers):
Lockdown. Lockdown.

26:13.420 --> 26:16.020
This is an emergency lockdown.
(siren wailing)

26:16.220 --> 26:18.390
All inmates remain in place.

26:18.590 --> 26:19.590
Boris, no.

26:19.790 --> 26:21.340
Out of my way, Delgado.

26:22.340 --> 26:24.300
I said move!

26:24.500 --> 26:25.600
Boris, what are you doing?

26:25.800 --> 26:27.400
(grunting)

26:27.600 --> 26:30.750
(Yuri coughing)

26:31.320 --> 26:32.600
(groans)

26:32.800 --> 26:34.990
Son of a b... (grunts)

26:37.390 --> 26:39.290
(groaning)

26:44.170 --> 26:46.230
(coughs)

26:59.880 --> 27:01.930
I don't care if the prison
is in lockdown, Warden.

27:02.130 --> 27:04.500
I want Special Agent Torres
released immediately.

27:04.700 --> 27:07.200
Well, then escort him out
personally if you have to.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.040
And do it without saying
a word to anyone.

27:09.240 --> 27:10.710
Something tells me
you've already said enough.

27:10.910 --> 27:12.180
WARDEN:
Look, at this point, I just...

27:12.380 --> 27:13.440
Hold on.
What the hell happened?

27:13.640 --> 27:15.380
Kasie and Jimmy saw
the whole thing

27:15.580 --> 27:16.780
on the prison's
security camera.

27:16.980 --> 27:19.630
It was a hit.
By Yuri's own two men.

27:21.470 --> 27:23.020
Any idea of motive?
Not yet.

27:23.220 --> 27:26.560
You think this could somehow
be related to Kostya's attack?

27:26.760 --> 27:27.960
I think we need to
look into it.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.530
Any chances we can get
these two yahoos sent to us?

27:30.730 --> 27:32.300
All right, listen up.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.530
I'm sending two vehicles
to the prison.

27:34.730 --> 27:36.900
One for my guy,
and one for the two suspects,

27:37.100 --> 27:39.170
Boris Popov, Lev Trotski.

27:39.370 --> 27:40.470
Let me see what I can do.

27:40.670 --> 27:41.510
Look, if I have to go
all the way up

27:41.710 --> 27:42.610
to the BOP director, I will.

27:42.810 --> 27:43.880
Sir, there's no reason for that.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.090
So make it happen. Now.
Yes, sir.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.280
Chances are good,

27:48.480 --> 27:49.650
but we're only gonna get
one of the yahoos.

27:49.850 --> 27:52.220
Boris is still unconscious
in the infirmary.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.350
And how's Torres?

27:53.550 --> 27:54.990
You can ask him yourself, McGee.

27:55.190 --> 27:56.700
He'll be here in an hour.

28:03.880 --> 28:04.530
Hey.

28:04.730 --> 28:06.200
Welcome back, Nick.

28:06.400 --> 28:07.970
Thank you.

28:08.170 --> 28:09.500
Nick.

28:09.700 --> 28:10.840
You might need
stitches there.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.050
Yeah, that's
a tomorrow problem.

28:19.060 --> 28:20.430
(engine stops)

28:21.560 --> 28:23.850
(scoffs)
I knew you were the rat.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.020
No, you didn't.

28:25.220 --> 28:27.080
I would have figured
soon enough.

28:27.280 --> 28:28.720
No, you wouldn't have.

28:28.920 --> 28:31.490
I am certain
I see you soon, Delgado...

28:31.690 --> 28:33.740
or whatever your name is.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.630
Any clue why he did it?

28:37.830 --> 28:39.530
I got a theory,
but I won't know for sure

28:39.730 --> 28:40.800
until we get him in the room.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.130
Glad to have
you back, Nick.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.470
And I'm sure you're glad
to have this back.

28:45.670 --> 28:47.200
Yeah.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.070
Thanks.
See you up there.

28:49.270 --> 28:50.990
You got it.

28:54.960 --> 28:58.380
(recording):
Hola, it's Lucia.
Leave a message.

28:58.580 --> 29:00.450
I found him, sis.

29:00.650 --> 29:03.190
You know who I'm talking about.

29:03.390 --> 29:05.540
The bastard's still alive.

29:06.810 --> 29:08.740
And he's still doing it.

29:11.110 --> 29:12.650
I love you.

29:21.460 --> 29:22.940
(sucking)

29:23.140 --> 29:25.440
(chuckles)
What's that? A... a ferret?

29:25.640 --> 29:27.380
No, that is you.

29:27.580 --> 29:29.810
Oh, I'm a ferret?
A rat.

29:30.010 --> 29:31.520
(laughing)

29:31.720 --> 29:33.050
You are making a joke
at me again.

29:33.250 --> 29:36.120
You believe
you are winning.
You're the one in chains.

29:36.320 --> 29:39.620
No, you are the one
so far behind in race,

29:39.820 --> 29:41.060
you think you are champion.

29:41.260 --> 29:44.060
But you're the one
who killed his buddy.

29:44.260 --> 29:45.930
Boss. Not buddy.

29:46.130 --> 29:48.530
Buddy shares
his filet mignon.

29:48.730 --> 29:50.730
Boss makes you
watch him eat it.

29:50.940 --> 29:53.810
After so much time,
we snap,

29:54.010 --> 29:55.140
lash out.

29:55.340 --> 29:57.740
So, you and Boris
decided to kill Yuri...

29:57.940 --> 30:00.240
for steak?
Not just steak.

30:00.440 --> 30:01.480
Respect.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.950
You just killed
Kostya Valkov's son.

30:05.150 --> 30:08.570
When you go back to prison,
he's gonna have you killed.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.810
I am scared of no one.

30:13.340 --> 30:14.690
You know, I keep, uh...

30:14.890 --> 30:16.630
flashing back to something
you said in the yard.

30:16.830 --> 30:18.600
"When it comes to Kostya,

30:18.800 --> 30:21.700
anything but loyalty
is suicide."

30:21.900 --> 30:23.630
See, you're having
too much fun

30:23.830 --> 30:25.240
to be suicidal, Lev.

30:25.440 --> 30:28.910
I am boring of this.
You want to know
what I think?

30:29.110 --> 30:31.310
I think you didn't just
lashed out and kill Yuri.

30:31.510 --> 30:34.030
I think you were following
orders from Kostya.

30:35.200 --> 30:38.420
'Cause all that matters
to Kostya is his attack.

30:38.620 --> 30:41.520
He didn't want his bigmouth son
to screw it all up

30:41.720 --> 30:43.720
by saying too much
to an undercover Fed.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.320
That's how much
he hates America.

30:46.520 --> 30:48.430
He sacrificed his own son.

30:48.630 --> 30:50.900
I hate America, too.

30:51.100 --> 30:55.150
Except for one thing.
Your legal protections.

30:57.280 --> 30:58.850
I want lawyer.

31:06.060 --> 31:08.550
If Torres is right,
that means that

31:08.750 --> 31:10.920
Lev and Kostya have been
communicating.

31:11.120 --> 31:14.850
Which means Lev probably knows
details about the attack.

31:15.050 --> 31:16.220
(Torres clears throat)

31:16.420 --> 31:18.760
Well, he lawyer up
faster than I thought.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.910
(phone chimes)

31:21.810 --> 31:23.060
Speaking of his lawyer,

31:23.260 --> 31:25.100
security says
he's at the front gate now.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.760
We didn't even let Lev
make a call yet.

31:27.970 --> 31:30.100
PARKER:
Someone made
a call for him.

31:30.300 --> 31:31.500
It has to be Kostya.

31:31.700 --> 31:33.440
He's covering his bases.

31:33.640 --> 31:36.540
He's making sure Lev
doesn't talk either.

31:36.740 --> 31:38.680
If Kostya hired
his lawyer,

31:38.880 --> 31:40.740
I'll bet you Lev has
never met him before.

31:40.940 --> 31:42.610
So?
Call base security,

31:42.810 --> 31:44.350
have them delay
the lawyer's entrance

31:44.550 --> 31:46.850
by ten minutes.
Why?

31:47.050 --> 31:49.700
You still got
your briefcase?

31:54.110 --> 31:56.760
How you holding up,
Mr. Trotski?

31:56.960 --> 31:58.730
You are my lawyer?

31:58.930 --> 32:00.260
What do you think?

32:00.460 --> 32:02.100
TORRES:
Are we sure
this is legal, McGee?

32:02.300 --> 32:04.400
As long as Parker
doesn't really say

32:04.600 --> 32:05.640
that he's his lawyer,

32:05.840 --> 32:08.740
it is legal... ish.

32:08.940 --> 32:11.440
Any questions for me?

32:11.640 --> 32:13.040
No.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.880
Fair enough.

32:15.080 --> 32:18.150
Just a message from...

32:18.350 --> 32:19.580
you know who.

32:19.780 --> 32:22.040
I do. Know who.

32:34.480 --> 32:35.920
For Anastasia.

32:38.950 --> 32:40.990
You understand this, yes?

32:44.630 --> 32:46.090
What do you think?

32:47.060 --> 32:50.850
PARKER:
RF-20723E

32:51.050 --> 32:52.550
What the hell
does this mean?

32:52.750 --> 32:54.790
I did a DMV search
to rule out the obvious,

32:54.990 --> 32:57.250
but it's not a
Dodge Challenger license plate.

32:57.450 --> 32:58.990
Well, it's not
a license plate at all.

32:59.190 --> 33:01.230
No private or commercial
vehicle in the U.S.

33:01.430 --> 33:02.560
has that license number.

33:02.760 --> 33:04.960
He said it was for Anastasia,

33:05.160 --> 33:07.400
which we believe is
the code name for the attack.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.030
This must be a code, too,

33:09.230 --> 33:10.900
like everything else
with Kostya.

33:11.100 --> 33:12.870
All right, so let's go
with the number.

33:13.070 --> 33:15.340
KNIGHT:
20723.

33:15.540 --> 33:18.040
That is a zip code
for Laurel, Maryland.

33:18.240 --> 33:20.580
Any major power stations
near Laurel?

33:20.780 --> 33:21.580
Uh, checking now.

33:21.780 --> 33:22.610
Could be a date.

33:22.810 --> 33:24.920
February 7, 2023.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.080
What happened on that day?

33:27.280 --> 33:28.820
Like, in the whole world?
PARKER:
Yeah.

33:29.020 --> 33:30.690
All right, McGee, um...
(snapping fingers)

33:30.890 --> 33:32.220
RFs, go.

33:32.420 --> 33:34.430
Uh... right field,

33:34.630 --> 33:38.060
radio frequencies,
Russian Federation.

33:38.260 --> 33:40.260
Maybe the Challenger that we're
looking for is in Russia?

33:40.460 --> 33:43.800
It might take a minute to get
into the Russian DMV database.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.200
Mm, don't bother, McGee.

33:45.400 --> 33:48.190
The Challenger isn't a car,
it's a plane.

33:49.160 --> 33:51.310
A Bombardier Challenger,
and the license plate number

33:51.510 --> 33:53.480
is, uh,
really the tail number.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.000
Who's it registered to?

33:56.300 --> 33:57.950
KNIGHT: A shell company
based in Minsk.

33:58.150 --> 33:59.650
All right, I'm looking at
a flight-tracking website,

33:59.850 --> 34:02.750
shows this plane took off
from Moscow ten hours ago.

34:02.950 --> 34:03.920
Headed where?

34:04.120 --> 34:05.960
There's no flight plan filed,

34:06.160 --> 34:08.430
but its current location
is 90 miles east of D.C.

34:08.630 --> 34:09.960
and it is descending.

34:10.160 --> 34:12.800
I'll bet you a baklava
that Kostya's on that plane.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.830
I'll text Kasie, have her start
tracking that plane for us.

34:16.030 --> 34:17.250
All right, good.
Let's gear up.

34:20.890 --> 34:23.410
(electrical crackling)

34:23.610 --> 34:24.910
That can't be good.

34:25.110 --> 34:27.380
(power whirring down)
(electrical crackling)

34:27.580 --> 34:28.930
Look.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.840
It's starting.

34:42.040 --> 34:43.760
(distant sirens wailing)

34:43.960 --> 34:45.500
What now?

34:45.700 --> 34:47.230
McGee, how bad is this?

34:47.430 --> 34:48.900
Oh, backup generators
just kicked in.

34:49.100 --> 34:50.030
Now we can get a better

34:50.230 --> 34:51.370
sense of the scale
of the outages.

34:51.570 --> 34:52.840
Phone lines are dead.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.140
No cell service either.

34:54.340 --> 34:56.140
Internet is out, too.

34:56.340 --> 34:58.540
The elevators,
the-the computers,

34:58.740 --> 35:00.710
pretty much anything
with a power switch is useless.

35:00.910 --> 35:02.550
This is exactly
what Kostya wanted.

35:02.750 --> 35:04.120
But how did he do it?

35:04.320 --> 35:06.480
It's too widespread for
a substation attack, right?

35:06.680 --> 35:08.690
Yeah, and we can rule out
an electromagnetic pulse--

35:08.890 --> 35:10.690
we would have noticed
the voltage surge.

35:10.890 --> 35:13.760
So what?
Computer virus?
McGEE: It's got to be.

35:13.960 --> 35:16.390
But to disable power
to an entire city

35:16.590 --> 35:18.760
would take something that
has to bypass

35:18.960 --> 35:20.900
three levels of
128-bit encryption.

35:21.100 --> 35:24.800
There's really only one type
of virus that can do that.

35:25.000 --> 35:25.940
Polymorphic.

35:26.140 --> 35:28.000
Yeah, I have no idea
what that is,

35:28.210 --> 35:29.170
but it sounds scary.

35:29.370 --> 35:30.640
How do we stop it?

35:30.840 --> 35:33.610
We have to find the host
computer and shut it down.

35:33.810 --> 35:34.980
TORRES:
Wait, are you saying

35:35.180 --> 35:36.750
there's someone at their
computer right now,

35:36.950 --> 35:39.550
petting a hairless cat
while they black out the city?

35:39.750 --> 35:41.720
Pretty much.
We just don't know who.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.750
Well, it can't be Kostya.
He's on a plane.

35:43.950 --> 35:47.960
A plane we cannot track without
Internet or cell service.

35:48.160 --> 35:49.290
Yes, we can.

35:49.490 --> 35:50.590
(panting):
Sorry.

35:50.790 --> 35:52.060
I just ran up
two flights of stairs.

35:52.260 --> 35:54.170
Kasie said we might be able
to track the plane

35:54.370 --> 35:55.830
using its radio frequency?

35:56.030 --> 35:57.470
All right,
let's get in the car,

35:57.670 --> 35:59.070
and have Kasie tell us
where to go.

35:59.270 --> 36:01.240
Wait, how-how are we
gonna do that, uh...?

36:01.440 --> 36:03.070
We don't even have
any cell service.

36:03.270 --> 36:04.280
With these.

36:04.480 --> 36:05.740
Max range is only 35 miles,

36:05.940 --> 36:07.380
so let's hope
he lands close by.

36:07.580 --> 36:08.980
All right,
it's a 4,700-mile flight.

36:09.180 --> 36:11.650
That's at the very max of
the Bombardier's field range.

36:11.850 --> 36:14.340
Wheels should be down soon.
And we'll be waiting.

36:15.540 --> 36:17.200
Testing, testing, over.

36:18.570 --> 36:21.160
WOMAN (over radio):
<i>Total blackouts confirmed</i>
<i>in Philadelphia,</i>

36:21.360 --> 36:23.260
<i>Baltimore, New York and D.C.</i>

36:23.460 --> 36:24.600
No word yet on the cause,

36:24.800 --> 36:26.530
but officials in Boston
are bracing...

36:26.730 --> 36:29.200
The virus is taking out
the grid, one sector at a time.

36:29.400 --> 36:30.930
KASIE (over radio):
Come in, Jess.
You guys need to

36:31.130 --> 36:33.500
U-turn as soon
as possible. Over.

36:33.700 --> 36:35.370
Why, what happened?

36:35.570 --> 36:37.310
I accidentally followed
the wrong radio signal--

36:37.510 --> 36:39.080
I was chasing an 18-wheeler.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.410
Over.

36:40.610 --> 36:42.310
Kostya must've known
he could use the blackout

36:42.510 --> 36:43.860
to land undetected.

36:49.470 --> 36:51.590
Why is he coming
here at all?

36:51.790 --> 36:53.520
Leaving Russia is
such a huge risk.

36:53.720 --> 36:54.930
He's here for Anastasia.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.360
That's the code name
for the attack.
Maybe.

36:57.560 --> 36:58.760
Or maybe not. I mean,
for all we know,

36:58.960 --> 37:00.160
Anastasia
could be a woman.

37:00.360 --> 37:01.500
In Kostya's file,

37:01.700 --> 37:03.130
there's no mention of
a woman named Anastasia.

37:03.330 --> 37:05.300
There's a lot about
Kostya we don't know.

37:05.500 --> 37:07.470
If there is an
actual Anastasia,

37:07.670 --> 37:08.940
it will be like
looking for a needle

37:09.140 --> 37:10.110
in a stack of needles.

37:10.310 --> 37:12.080
There's millions
of Anastasias in Russia.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.140
Really?

37:13.340 --> 37:14.310
Yeah, they're all named after

37:14.510 --> 37:16.180
some old Russian princess.

37:16.380 --> 37:17.410
A princess?

37:17.610 --> 37:18.780
Yeah. Why?

37:18.980 --> 37:19.980
Yuri has a sister.

37:20.180 --> 37:21.850
He called her
"daddy's little princess."

37:22.050 --> 37:24.020
According to Yuri's file,
he doesn't have a sister.

37:24.220 --> 37:25.490
According to Yuri,
he does.

37:25.690 --> 37:27.290
I may have found Kostya.

37:27.490 --> 37:30.260
I think he just landed at
the Harrison Regional Airport.

37:30.460 --> 37:33.600
But it's possible I've been
tracking the wrong plane. Over.

37:33.800 --> 37:36.870
Harrison Airport, found it.
It's in, uh, Culpeper.

37:37.070 --> 37:39.570
We just set up Evelyn Shaw in
the witness protection program

37:39.770 --> 37:40.770
in a house in Culpeper.

37:40.970 --> 37:42.740
And Evelyn just
so happens to be

37:42.940 --> 37:44.580
a coding savant
who's capable of

37:44.780 --> 37:46.680
creating a polymorphic
malware virus.

37:46.880 --> 37:49.180
You think Evelyn
is Kostya's daughter?

37:49.380 --> 37:50.710
Daddy's little princess?

37:50.910 --> 37:53.470
Forget the airport.
We're going to Evelyn's house.

37:57.800 --> 37:59.570
That's got to be it.

38:00.740 --> 38:02.590
McGee, Knight,
go around back.

38:02.790 --> 38:04.210
Torres and I will
take the front.

38:05.250 --> 38:07.810
(computer chirping)

38:17.090 --> 38:19.280
McGEE:
Witness protection marshals.

38:19.480 --> 38:21.190
Both executed.

38:34.710 --> 38:37.040
NCIS! Hands in the air.

38:42.650 --> 38:44.220
(groaning)

38:56.430 --> 38:58.180
It's over, Evelyn!

38:58.380 --> 39:00.230
Idiot.

39:07.510 --> 39:09.610
(gun clicking)

39:10.880 --> 39:12.280
Drop your weapon,
Evelyn.

39:13.280 --> 39:15.280
(sighs)

39:16.250 --> 39:17.650
Just shoot me.

39:18.320 --> 39:19.500
Please.

39:19.700 --> 39:21.660
We're not gonna
let you off that easy.

39:22.220 --> 39:23.810
(handcuffs clicking)

39:24.010 --> 39:27.080
PARKER:
Evelyn Shaw,
aka Viktoria Valkov.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.710
VANCE:
So, daddy's little princess here

39:28.910 --> 39:30.080
was the mastermind
behind the attack?

39:30.280 --> 39:32.750
It was more of a
father-daughter production.

39:32.950 --> 39:35.250
KNIGHT:
Kostya couldn't do it
without her coding skills

39:35.450 --> 39:36.590
so they staged a fake hit

39:36.790 --> 39:38.150
to get her into
witness protection.

39:38.350 --> 39:40.690
And Yuri?
After he did his job,
he was a liability,

39:40.890 --> 39:42.790
therefore, expendable,
so he had to go.

39:42.990 --> 39:44.190
He was killed by
his own father?

39:44.390 --> 39:45.860
Number one dad he was not.

39:46.060 --> 39:47.830
Wow. So, what's the status

39:48.030 --> 39:49.370
as far as getting
the power back on?

39:49.570 --> 39:50.570
McGee's at Evelyn's house

39:50.770 --> 39:51.740
with a dozen of
the government's best

39:51.940 --> 39:53.640
white hat hackers
working on it now.

39:53.840 --> 39:54.940
With a little luck,

39:55.140 --> 39:56.740
he'll get the evil genie
back in the bottle.

39:56.940 --> 40:00.540
And with cell towers down,
we can't get an ETA, right?

40:00.740 --> 40:02.010
Wrong.

40:02.210 --> 40:03.450
(clears throat)

40:03.650 --> 40:05.220
Mm-mm?

40:05.420 --> 40:09.090
McGee, Vance would like
an ETA. Over.

40:09.290 --> 40:10.450
(machines powering up)

40:10.650 --> 40:12.220
Oh. There you go.
Hey.
Hey...

40:12.420 --> 40:13.260
(laughing)
All right.

40:13.460 --> 40:14.530
(computers beeping)

40:14.730 --> 40:17.040
VANCE:
Back in business.

40:18.710 --> 40:20.800
Disregard that.
Great job, McGee. Over.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.280
McGEE (over radio):
Thanks. See you guys soon.

40:24.020 --> 40:25.300
So, where's our jailbird?

40:25.500 --> 40:27.600
I think the last few days
finally caught up to him.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.570
He said he was gonna go home,
sleep in his own bed.

40:29.770 --> 40:31.140
I think he's earned it.

40:31.340 --> 40:34.080
There's a 20-year-old
bottle of scotch in my office

40:34.280 --> 40:36.910
that's looking for company,
if anybody's interested.

40:37.110 --> 40:38.620
Oh, I can't think
of a better occasion

40:38.820 --> 40:40.380
to crack open
that bad boy.

40:40.580 --> 40:41.950
Second that.
VANCE:
Good.

40:42.150 --> 40:44.940
Um, I'll meet you guys
up there in a minute.
Okay.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.430
(phone whooshes)

40:51.630 --> 40:53.810
(crickets chirping)

40:55.750 --> 40:57.980
(car approaching)

41:01.250 --> 41:03.210
(engine stops,
car door opens)

41:03.410 --> 41:04.480
(car door closes)

41:04.680 --> 41:06.760
(keys jingling)
(door opens)

41:07.630 --> 41:08.680
(dog barking in distance)

41:08.880 --> 41:10.730
(door closes)

41:18.240 --> 41:19.990
MAN (chuckles nervously):
Hey.

41:20.190 --> 41:21.560
Take whatever you want,
all right?

41:21.760 --> 41:24.860
I've got, I've got money,
this watch, anything you want.

41:25.060 --> 41:26.700
I'm not here to rob you.

41:26.900 --> 41:28.800
Okay, so why are you here?

41:29.000 --> 41:30.500
You don't know who I am?

41:30.700 --> 41:31.500
No.

41:31.700 --> 41:34.100
Take your time.

41:34.300 --> 41:35.990
It'll come to you.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.140
(gasps softly)

41:41.340 --> 41:43.150
Nicky?

41:43.350 --> 41:44.520
Is that you?

41:44.720 --> 41:46.920
Oh, yeah.

41:47.120 --> 41:48.650
I'm not a kid anymore.

41:48.850 --> 41:52.740
Yeah, I-I can see that.

41:53.940 --> 41:57.430
Look, I-I... I thought a lot
about you, and your...

41:57.630 --> 41:58.700
your mom, and your sister.

41:58.900 --> 42:00.200
I thought about you often.

42:00.400 --> 42:04.020
Not as often as
I have thought about you.

42:05.720 --> 42:09.340
Hey, I-I want you to know
I'm a changed man now, Nicky.

42:09.540 --> 42:11.010
You know, the mistakes I made...

42:11.210 --> 42:13.480
Just stop.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.700
Stop talking.

42:21.670 --> 42:24.100
So, what-what do you want?

42:25.370 --> 42:27.010
What I've always wanted.

42:40.250 --> 42:42.160
To watch you die.
