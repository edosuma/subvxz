WEBVTT

00:01.581 --> 00:04.166
And this is the first known sighting

00:04.166 --> 00:05.467
of Super Danny

00:05.467 --> 00:09.137
and his adorable, if not slightly husky,

00:09.137 --> 00:12.140
sidekick... Riley Girl.

00:12.140 --> 00:13.608
That is so cute.

00:13.608 --> 00:15.911
Did you guys always go out
trick-or-treating together?

00:15.911 --> 00:17.913
Sadly that picture's not from Halloween.

00:17.913 --> 00:19.214
They just liked to dress up.

00:20.315 --> 00:21.983
Well, I tell all of my patients

00:21.983 --> 00:24.085
that fantasy play is
very healthy for children.

00:24.085 --> 00:25.954
They still do it.

00:25.954 --> 00:27.122
Oh.

00:27.122 --> 00:29.057
That's just creepy.

00:29.057 --> 00:31.059
Okay, it's not creepy;

00:31.059 --> 00:32.661
it's really sweet.

00:32.661 --> 00:33.962
When I was nine, I broke my leg

00:33.962 --> 00:35.030
and I missed Halloween.

00:35.030 --> 00:37.566
So six months later, Danny surprised me

00:37.566 --> 00:38.967
and took me trick-or-treating,

00:38.967 --> 00:40.435
just the two of us.

00:40.435 --> 00:43.205
And that's how Half-O-Wween was born.

00:43.205 --> 00:45.040
And now it has turned into

00:45.040 --> 00:47.309
this crazy drunken pub crawl.

00:47.309 --> 00:50.479
So wait, Danny actually
dresses up as a superhero

00:50.479 --> 00:52.147
and runs around the city?

00:52.147 --> 00:55.417
Because I've had people committed
for doing that exact same thing.

00:55.417 --> 00:57.919
Oh. Oh, we did get arrested once.

00:57.919 --> 01:00.422
Yeah, cutest mug shots ever!

01:00.422 --> 01:01.590
- Oh, here they are.
- Ohh.

01:01.590 --> 01:03.124
Hey hey hey, no!

01:03.124 --> 01:04.926
No looking at photo albums.

01:04.926 --> 01:05.927
(Laughing)

01:05.927 --> 01:07.295
Nothing anyone wants to see in there.

01:07.295 --> 01:08.263
Why?

01:08.263 --> 01:09.431
Are you afraid I'll discover

01:09.431 --> 01:12.334
your secret identity, Super Danny?

01:12.334 --> 01:13.635
Super Danny.

01:13.635 --> 01:15.971
Was she showing you
pictures of Super Danny?

01:15.971 --> 01:18.006
- (Amy giggles)
- That's just a stupid thing

01:18.006 --> 01:18.940
we used to do as kids.

01:18.940 --> 01:20.275
We're going out this Tuesday.

01:21.910 --> 01:23.945
Knock knock! Bonnie's Beauty Barn!

01:25.447 --> 01:27.983
Trim, cut and curl, you
don't have to be a girl.

01:27.983 --> 01:29.618
Who's first? 'Cause guess what?

01:29.618 --> 01:31.987
There's a new hair-iff in town.

01:31.987 --> 01:33.522
(Blows)

01:33.522 --> 01:35.690
Well, at least we know

01:35.690 --> 01:38.026
- you're not adopted.
- (Both chuckle)

01:38.026 --> 01:39.528
I think you've seen enough.

01:40.929 --> 01:42.397
Bye, mom.

01:42.397 --> 01:44.599
So what about you, Riley?

01:44.599 --> 01:47.235
You look like a girl
who likes a free haircut.

01:48.203 --> 01:50.972
- Hey, mom.
- Oh, hey, Benji.

01:50.972 --> 01:52.974
Thanks again for finding a daycare for Emma

01:52.974 --> 01:54.075
so I can go back to beauty school.

01:54.075 --> 01:57.979
I'm sorry... day what? Beauty where?

01:57.979 --> 01:59.981
Ben, I've been telling you every day

01:59.981 --> 02:02.117
you need to find somebody to watch Emma.

02:02.117 --> 02:03.652
- And what do I say?
- That you're on it.

02:03.652 --> 02:05.420
- Then I'm on it. When do you start?
- Tomorrow.

02:05.420 --> 02:07.422
Why don't you tell me these things?

02:07.422 --> 02:09.958
(Theme music playing)

02:09.958 --> 02:12.661
â™ª It's amazing how the unexpected â™ª

02:12.661 --> 02:15.964
â™ª can take your life
and change direction. â™ª

(baby cooing)

02:21.202 --> 02:23.138
Whoa! (Laughs)

02:23.138 --> 02:24.940
What do you think, Emma?

02:24.940 --> 02:26.575
You ready to make some new baby friends?

02:26.575 --> 02:28.977
But remember, no sharing your pacifier.

02:28.977 --> 02:30.946
You're not that kind of girl.

02:30.946 --> 02:32.080
Dude, I don't know, man.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.982
Are we sure that this place is legit?

02:33.982 --> 02:35.650
'Cause it looks fine to me. Okay.

02:37.652 --> 02:39.321
If I may.

02:43.124 --> 02:45.126
Tucker Dobbs, stroller wrangler.

02:45.126 --> 02:46.595
(Laughing)

02:46.595 --> 02:49.598
Saving the world one mommy at a time.

02:49.598 --> 02:52.267
Actually, I'm not a mommy.

02:52.267 --> 02:54.936
I'm the nanny. I'm kind of new here.

02:54.936 --> 02:57.105
Oh, well, let me show you around.

02:57.105 --> 02:58.907
(Chuckles)

02:58.907 --> 03:00.642
Well, this... 

03:00.642 --> 03:02.510
is locked.

03:02.510 --> 03:03.678
(Laughing)

03:03.678 --> 03:06.381
Hi, I'm Megan. What can I do for you?

03:06.381 --> 03:08.049
Pretty sure whatever you want.

03:08.049 --> 03:09.217
(Chuckles)

03:09.217 --> 03:10.919
Hi, I'm Ben, and this is Emma.

03:10.919 --> 03:12.520
(Baby-talk) Hi, Emma.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.356
Don't turn around, but
there's a strange man

03:14.356 --> 03:15.457
following you.

03:15.457 --> 03:16.625
Oh-ho-ho.

03:16.625 --> 03:17.592
So I'm not really sure how this works.

03:17.592 --> 03:19.628
Do I just hand her over

03:19.628 --> 03:20.962
and you give me a ticket

03:20.962 --> 03:22.998
or one of those restaurant buzzer thingies?

03:22.998 --> 03:24.599
(Normal voice) Oh,
you wanna drop her off.

03:24.599 --> 03:26.501
I'm sorry, but we're completely full.

03:26.501 --> 03:28.169
Oh, okay. Well, I don't have
to be at work for another hour,

03:28.169 --> 03:29.671
- so how long's the wait?
- Three months.

03:29.671 --> 03:31.673
Three months?

03:31.673 --> 03:33.575
She'll be able to drop herself off by then.

03:34.609 --> 03:36.077
Are you sure?

03:36.077 --> 03:38.079
How could you say no to this face?

03:40.015 --> 03:41.349
Or this one?

03:42.617 --> 03:44.953
Wow, cute baby and a flirty dad... 

03:44.953 --> 03:46.955
never get any of those in here.

03:46.955 --> 03:48.556
I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.

03:51.559 --> 03:53.695
Hey, baby lady. Nice crib.

03:54.696 --> 03:56.131
Tucker, where'd you get that?

03:56.131 --> 03:59.501
Mm. I traded it for my invisible dinosaur.

03:59.501 --> 04:01.569
(Laughs)

04:01.569 --> 04:03.271
Kids are so stupid.

04:03.271 --> 04:05.173
(Laughing) Okay.

04:05.173 --> 04:07.008
Okay, Emma, I gotta get to work.

04:07.008 --> 04:09.044
I'll see you at home, okay? All right.

04:11.179 --> 04:13.648
Sorry about that.

04:13.648 --> 04:15.116
So are you sure there's nothing you can do?

04:15.116 --> 04:17.285
Actually, I think there is.

04:17.285 --> 04:19.154
I didn't realize you were a couple.

04:22.057 --> 04:24.559
Who? Me and juice box?

04:24.559 --> 04:26.061
Yeah.

04:26.061 --> 04:27.696
I mean, a bi-racial gay couple?

04:27.696 --> 04:29.999
That's like hitting the jackpot

04:29.999 --> 04:31.934
on the diversity form. (Scoffs)

04:31.934 --> 04:33.803
Really?

04:33.803 --> 04:35.571
Yeah, you are a couple, aren't you?

04:35.571 --> 04:38.708
Yes, we are.

04:38.708 --> 04:41.711
Couple of guys raising a baby together.

04:41.711 --> 04:42.912
Perfect.

04:42.912 --> 04:44.647
Just fill out this application.

04:44.647 --> 04:46.649
I should be able to let you
know by the end of the day.

04:46.649 --> 04:47.817
Okay.

04:50.320 --> 04:53.055
You know, Emma, if you
were holding a scotch,

04:53.055 --> 04:55.825
you'd look just like my Aunt Evelyn.

04:55.825 --> 04:58.661
So what do you think about Danny and Amy?

04:58.661 --> 05:00.663
I mean, they seem like such opposites.

05:00.663 --> 05:03.566
She's so smart and refined and he's so... 

05:03.566 --> 05:05.968
(Inhales sharply) not those things.

05:05.968 --> 05:07.136
I mean,

05:07.136 --> 05:08.604
it's probably only a matter of time

05:08.604 --> 05:10.706
until Dr. Girlfriend
starts trying to change him.

05:10.471 --> 05:12.640
Yeah. Well, she can try all she wants,

05:12.640 --> 05:15.076
but that boy won't change for anyone.

05:15.076 --> 05:17.078
Hey, guys!

05:17.078 --> 05:19.080
Check out my new "jacket-a."

05:20.982 --> 05:22.884
(Scoffs) Danny?

05:22.884 --> 05:25.553
Riley, call the police. There's
a strange man in the living room.

05:26.988 --> 05:28.923
Amy picked it out for me.

05:28.923 --> 05:31.859
It's got elbow patches, which
is weird because it's brand-new.

05:33.427 --> 05:35.296
I needed something to wear to the Met.

05:35.296 --> 05:37.331
You went to a museum?!

05:37.331 --> 05:38.933
Danny, the last time you went to a museum

05:38.933 --> 05:42.637
you got thrown out for shoving
gum in the statue's butt crack.

05:42.637 --> 05:44.972
I wouldn't do that now.

05:44.972 --> 05:46.841
Amy was really specific.

05:48.009 --> 05:49.377
It was actually kinda cool.

05:50.378 --> 05:53.581
As cool as... this?

05:53.581 --> 05:55.049
I present you

05:55.049 --> 05:57.051
your new Half-O-Ween cape.

05:57.051 --> 05:59.053
I was thinking we could
meet here at like 7:00?

05:59.053 --> 06:01.822
About that... um. I was gonna
see if we could reschedule.

06:01.822 --> 06:03.558
Amy's parents are in town tonight.

06:03.558 --> 06:05.459
Oh. Um... 

06:05.459 --> 06:06.794
Yeah, that's okay. No biggie.

06:06.794 --> 06:08.095
We'll, uh... we'll reschedule.

06:09.764 --> 06:12.066
You know what? No no.
This is our tradition.

06:12.066 --> 06:13.768
I'll have a drink with Amy's parents,

06:13.768 --> 06:15.403
then I'll make up an excuse.

06:15.403 --> 06:16.537
Are you sure?

06:16.537 --> 06:18.372
Super sure.

06:20.007 --> 06:21.676
But let's not mention it to Amy.

06:21.676 --> 06:23.878
She can be a little uptight.

06:23.878 --> 06:25.880
Your words, not mine.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.381
All right, I'll see you at 9:00.

06:29.984 --> 06:32.353
Hello? Anyone here?

06:33.921 --> 06:35.590
Megan?

06:35.590 --> 06:36.891
Ben, is that you? I'm in the office.

06:36.891 --> 06:37.892
Just come on back.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.895
Hello? Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to... 

06:40.895 --> 06:42.096
I thought you said that you were... 

06:42.096 --> 06:44.765
It's okay. It's not like you care, right?

06:44.765 --> 06:46.367
Right.

06:46.367 --> 06:47.935
(Scoffs) Why would I care?

06:47.935 --> 06:49.403
Totally don't care.

06:49.403 --> 06:50.905
Nice bra, by the way.

06:50.905 --> 06:52.673
- Lacy.
- It's cute, right?

06:52.673 --> 06:55.843
- Very.
- It's probably the most expensive thing I own.

06:55.843 --> 06:58.679
Too bad the only people
who ever see it are me,

06:58.679 --> 07:00.781
my dog and now you.

07:00.781 --> 07:02.483
Lucky dog. (Chuckles)

07:02.483 --> 07:03.784
So, uh,

07:03.784 --> 07:05.820
- you're single?
- (Scoffs) Yup.

07:05.820 --> 07:06.854
We can't all find true love.

07:06.854 --> 07:07.989
I hear that.

07:09.824 --> 07:12.026
Oh, right. Me and Tucker.

07:12.026 --> 07:14.562
Oh, I almost forgot. You're in.

07:14.562 --> 07:16.697
I talked to my manager and
Emma can start in the morning

07:16.697 --> 07:18.532
right after parent orientation.

07:18.532 --> 07:19.834
That's fantastic!

07:19.834 --> 07:21.902
Should we hug?

07:26.941 --> 07:28.309
Oh my God.

07:30.444 --> 07:32.747
Is it really you?

07:32.747 --> 07:35.883
Is it really Riley Girl
here on my fire escape?

07:35.883 --> 07:38.719
(Sarcastically) In the flesh.

07:38.719 --> 07:40.021
So where's your trusty sidekick?

07:40.021 --> 07:41.022
(Sighs)

07:41.022 --> 07:42.823
He stood me up.

07:42.823 --> 07:44.859
Apparently he has a new partner-in-crime

07:44.859 --> 07:47.895
and her name is Dr. Snooty-No-Fun.

07:47.895 --> 07:51.732
Hey, well, don't get your
tights all in a bunch.

07:51.732 --> 07:52.867
I'll step in.

07:52.867 --> 07:54.869
Ooh, what about a pirate?

07:54.869 --> 07:57.405
Ladies love Tucker in an eye patch.

07:57.405 --> 07:58.739
(Chuckles)

07:58.739 --> 08:00.574
He always gets the booty.

08:00.574 --> 08:01.809
(Laughing) Okay.

08:02.877 --> 08:03.844
It's, uh... 

08:03.844 --> 08:05.880
it's kind of a superhero thing, so... 

08:05.880 --> 08:07.048
Oh, perfect.

08:07.048 --> 08:08.883
Because the ladies also love Tucker

08:08.883 --> 08:10.484
in rain boots and a tablecloth.

08:10.484 --> 08:11.485
(Whooshes)

08:16.891 --> 08:19.427
- (Clears throat)
- I really appreciate it,

08:19.427 --> 08:21.595
but, uh, I'm good.

08:21.595 --> 08:24.832
I just wish he would have let me know
before I bought a new utility belt.

08:24.832 --> 08:26.567
I mean, it has a web shooter.

08:26.567 --> 08:27.568
That's really cool.

08:29.837 --> 08:31.706
- I know.
- I don't... 

08:34.842 --> 08:38.011
Here she is. All polished and
ready to conquer her first day

08:38.011 --> 08:39.413
of napping, drooling

08:39.413 --> 08:42.049
and ignoring the boy babies.

08:42.049 --> 08:44.385
Hey. Where's Tucker?

08:44.385 --> 08:45.886
No idea. (Chuckles)

08:45.886 --> 08:47.555
I am on my own.

08:49.023 --> 08:52.360
But we really need both
parents for orientation.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.095
If he's not here, I can't
let Emma start today.

08:54.095 --> 08:56.964
When I said "no idea," I meant out of town.

08:59.367 --> 09:00.634
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

09:00.634 --> 09:03.938
I just saw him walk by
the window 20 minutes ago.

09:03.938 --> 09:06.474
Huh.

09:06.474 --> 09:07.541
You did?

09:07.541 --> 09:08.776
Ben, what's going on?

09:08.776 --> 09:11.612
Um, okay, uh, here's the thing.

09:11.612 --> 09:12.847
- Uh... 
- Oh, no.

09:12.847 --> 09:15.383
Did something happen with you and Tucker?

09:15.383 --> 09:17.385
Uh... yes.

09:17.385 --> 09:19.920
Something... something did happen.

09:21.355 --> 09:22.823
Tucker left us.

09:24.558 --> 09:26.827
Oh, my God. You poor thing!

09:26.827 --> 09:29.864
Oh, if there's anything I can do to help... 

09:29.864 --> 09:31.699
Oh, you're doing just fine.

09:34.804 --> 09:37.640
Hey, Mrs. Wheeler. Is Danny here?

09:37.640 --> 09:39.242
Yeah, he's in the shower.

09:39.242 --> 09:40.410
20 minutes till my class,

09:40.410 --> 09:42.111
and I can't find my lucky comb.

09:42.111 --> 09:44.113
I won't tell you what I have found,

09:44.113 --> 09:46.382
otherwise you will never sit here again.

09:47.350 --> 09:49.886
Well, it's official... I don't get men.

09:49.886 --> 09:51.387
And I get a lot of them. What do you need?

09:52.722 --> 09:54.724
I was talking about Danny.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.893
He's totally letting Amy change him,

09:56.893 --> 09:58.561
which is weird because he's the one

09:58.561 --> 10:00.363
that called her uptight in the first place.

10:02.265 --> 10:03.766
Danny called me uptight?

10:03.766 --> 10:05.602
Oh, by the way, Amy's here.

10:08.371 --> 10:10.240
You know what? I'll just buy another comb.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.241
Bye-bye.

10:13.243 --> 10:14.744
(Door opens)

10:14.744 --> 10:16.546
- Did he really say that about me?
- (Door closes)

10:16.546 --> 10:17.880
No no no no no no.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.717
You totally took that out of context.

10:20.717 --> 10:22.885
Uh, he... he was talking about your hair.

10:22.885 --> 10:25.722
Which is sometimes up and... and tight.

10:27.357 --> 10:30.393
For your information, I am not uptight.

10:30.393 --> 10:33.363
I mean, there is nobody more
go-with-the-flow than I am.

10:33.363 --> 10:35.498
I mean, (Stammering) I've... 

10:35.498 --> 10:37.367
stolen soap from a hotel before.

10:37.367 --> 10:38.568
Yeah.

10:38.568 --> 10:41.337
And sometimes I eat
grapes in the supermarket

10:41.337 --> 10:42.405
and I don't pay for 'em.

10:45.375 --> 10:48.544
And it is that kind of carefree quality

10:48.544 --> 10:50.246
that explains why Danny loves

10:50.246 --> 10:51.481
spending so much time with you.

10:51.481 --> 10:54.317
Ohh, so that's what this is about.

10:54.317 --> 10:56.352
You're jealous.

10:56.352 --> 10:58.321
Okay, now it all makes sense.

10:58.321 --> 11:00.356
No, I am so not jealous.

11:00.356 --> 11:02.525
And this isn't about me.

11:02.525 --> 11:04.527
This is about you. I mean, you are

11:04.527 --> 11:06.863
so busy making Danny do everything

11:06.863 --> 11:09.165
that you wanna do, you
haven't even bothered

11:09.165 --> 11:10.800
to figure out what he likes to do.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.869
I think I know Danny pretty well.

11:12.869 --> 11:14.871
Oh. Oh, really? Do you?

11:14.871 --> 11:16.539
Okay, what's his favorite
thing to eat for dinner?

11:16.539 --> 11:18.274
- Sushi.
- Chocolate cereal.

11:19.876 --> 11:21.411
What's his favorite color?

11:21.411 --> 11:22.845
He looks good in green.

11:22.845 --> 11:24.847
He hates green. Loves blue.

11:24.847 --> 11:26.182
You know what else he loves?

11:26.182 --> 11:28.851
He loves ball games and beer

11:28.851 --> 11:30.353
and trivia night

11:30.353 --> 11:31.688
and taco Tuesdays.

11:31.688 --> 11:35.224
He loves riding shotgun and playing pranks.

11:35.224 --> 11:36.626
But more than that,

11:36.626 --> 11:38.294
he is the guy that created

11:38.294 --> 11:40.229
an entire fake holiday

11:40.229 --> 11:42.398
to make a little girl
feel better about herself.

11:42.358 --> 11:44.060
So no, Amy,

11:44.060 --> 11:45.461
I don't think you know him at all.

11:45.461 --> 11:46.729
(Door opens)

11:46.729 --> 11:48.731
Oh, hey!

11:50.833 --> 11:52.135
How cool is this?

11:52.135 --> 11:54.671
My two favorite ladies
hanging out together.

11:58.141 --> 11:59.642
Ben: You know, in hindsight,

11:59.642 --> 12:01.711
I think it was the best thing
that could have ever happened.

12:01.711 --> 12:04.514
Tucker and I were never
even really that serious.

12:04.514 --> 12:07.116
You have a child together.

12:08.785 --> 12:11.220
Actually, I'm the one who had the child.

12:11.220 --> 12:12.789
Oh.

12:12.789 --> 12:14.257
With a woman.

12:15.692 --> 12:17.760
(Shakily) Who I had sex with to make it.

12:19.662 --> 12:22.065
I think that part of the
problem is that Tucker knows that

12:22.065 --> 12:23.766
I'm still attracted to women.

12:23.766 --> 12:25.568
Well, I guess that explains it.

12:25.568 --> 12:28.571
I totally thought my gaydar
was broken when I met you.

12:28.571 --> 12:30.306
I thought I sensed a little attraction.

12:30.306 --> 12:32.208
And I guess maybe Tucker sensed it too.

12:32.208 --> 12:33.609
He can be so jealous.

12:35.144 --> 12:36.612
Oh, my God. Don't turn around.

12:36.612 --> 12:37.747
He's here.

12:39.148 --> 12:40.149
I'll be right back, okay?

12:44.087 --> 12:45.088
(Inaudible)

12:46.656 --> 12:49.659
What is wrong with you? Why
do you keep waving your arms?

12:49.659 --> 12:51.327
It's complicated.

12:51.327 --> 12:53.496
But it would be super-helpful
if you poked me in the chest.

12:58.534 --> 13:00.069
Oh, hey, is that daycare cutie?

13:00.069 --> 13:02.071
Ask her if can get that nanny's number.

13:02.071 --> 13:03.239
Done!

13:03.239 --> 13:04.674
But only if you go.

13:05.675 --> 13:06.676
Seriously, dude?

13:06.676 --> 13:08.544
Do you need medical attention?

13:08.544 --> 13:10.380
I'll explain later. I promise.

13:10.380 --> 13:12.548
But if you could throw up
your hands and stomp off,

13:12.548 --> 13:13.683
I'd really appreciate it.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:24.076 --> 13:26.045
Hey. Just got your text.

13:26.045 --> 13:27.046
Is everything okay?

13:27.046 --> 13:28.614
What did you say to Amy this morning?

13:28.614 --> 13:31.317
What? Me? Nothing. Why do
you think I said something?

13:31.317 --> 13:33.419
You told her I called her uptight.

13:33.419 --> 13:35.054
Oh, yeah. That might have come up.

13:36.355 --> 13:38.057
Riley, she broke up with me.

13:38.057 --> 13:40.059
Oh my God, Danny, I'm sorry.

13:40.059 --> 13:41.894
It just... it just came out.

13:41.894 --> 13:44.664
But honestly, you haven't been
acting like yourself around her.

13:44.664 --> 13:46.732
Why? Because I went to a museum?

13:46.732 --> 13:49.101
No, because you're doing things
that you don't even like to do.

13:49.101 --> 13:51.470
It's because I like her!

13:51.470 --> 13:53.973
That's what you're supposed
to do when you like somebody.

13:53.973 --> 13:56.442
The Riley I know would
understand that and be supportive.

13:56.442 --> 13:58.444
If you keep telling everyone
you're my best friend,

13:58.444 --> 13:59.845
how about you act like it?

14:03.349 --> 14:05.017
(Cellphone ringing)

14:06.852 --> 14:08.454
Bonnie's Beauty Barn.

14:08.454 --> 14:11.090
Congratulations, you just
got one step closer to pretty.

14:14.760 --> 14:17.096
Oh! I would love to.

14:17.096 --> 14:18.931
No no no no, that's perfect.

14:18.931 --> 14:20.066
I'll see you in a few.

14:20.066 --> 14:22.468
- Yow!
- Don't wanna talk about it anymore.

14:22.468 --> 14:23.803
Oh, hey, Danny, guess what?

14:23.803 --> 14:24.970
- I just got my very first client.
- (Door slams)

14:24.970 --> 14:26.372
Danny, I'm so sorry.

14:26.372 --> 14:27.673
Hey, Riles, big news!

14:27.673 --> 14:29.408
- You're never gonna... 
- (Door slams)

14:30.976 --> 14:32.078
- Hey, mom.
- All right, don't you move

14:32.078 --> 14:33.612
until I'm done talking about myself.

14:34.747 --> 14:37.083
I just got my first client.

14:37.083 --> 14:39.418
(Squeals) Where's Emma?

14:39.418 --> 14:40.920
I thought you were picking her up.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.054
No. No, not me.

14:42.054 --> 14:44.423
Well, if you're not, then who is?

14:46.058 --> 14:49.562
- Tucker?
- Oh. Hey, baby lady.

14:49.562 --> 14:50.563
(Tucker chuckles)

14:52.174 --> 14:54.277
Okay, this is a little embarrassing,

14:54.277 --> 14:56.145
but I don't think I can
give you Emma right now.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.280
Oh!

14:57.280 --> 14:59.782
If she needs to be changed,
by all means, take your time.

14:59.782 --> 15:00.983
(Chuckles)

15:00.983 --> 15:04.654
You know, uh, you got
my boy pretty worked up.

15:04.654 --> 15:08.257
Listen, I so don't want to
get in the middle of anything.

15:08.257 --> 15:09.225
Oh, no, you're not.

15:09.225 --> 15:11.193
Look, if you just give
me that girl's number,

15:11.193 --> 15:13.496
I swear she will never
even know where I got it.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.264
- Whose number?
- That nanny's.

15:15.264 --> 15:17.266
- You're looking for a nanny?
- At the end of the day,

15:17.266 --> 15:18.501
who isn't, right?

15:18.501 --> 15:19.502
(Laughing)

15:19.502 --> 15:20.870
Oh, great. You're all here.

15:20.870 --> 15:21.971
Look at us, being civil.

15:21.971 --> 15:24.273
Okay, uh, let's grab Emma and go.

15:24.273 --> 15:26.142
Or better yet, I'll grab Emma

15:26.142 --> 15:27.209
and you go.

15:27.209 --> 15:29.912
Cool. See you at home then.

15:29.912 --> 15:30.913
Wait.

15:30.913 --> 15:32.281
I thought you said he moved out.

15:32.281 --> 15:34.150
What? Why would I move out?

15:34.150 --> 15:36.652
That's life in the big
city. Everyone's on the move.

15:36.652 --> 15:37.987
And shouldn't you be?

15:41.157 --> 15:42.258
What's going on?

15:42.258 --> 15:44.894
Ben, you told me you were a couple.

15:44.894 --> 15:47.263
- A couple of guys raising a baby.
- (Tucker exhales)

15:47.263 --> 15:51.100
You gotta be careful just
tossing that around, Ben.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.235
People will start to think we're gay.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.807
Oh my God! You lied to me?!

15:57.807 --> 16:00.209
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.711
But Emma really needed daycare,

16:01.711 --> 16:03.713
and you were all "hey, look at my bra."

16:03.713 --> 16:05.748
I showed you my bra!

16:05.748 --> 16:07.249
(Exhales) Oh my God,

16:07.249 --> 16:09.085
why didn't I get to see her bra?

16:10.086 --> 16:11.620
Dude, come on.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.622
Please, is there any possible way we can

16:13.622 --> 16:14.857
just do this again and start over?

16:14.857 --> 16:16.025
Sure.

16:16.025 --> 16:17.159
We're full.

16:17.159 --> 16:18.828
Get your baby and get out.

16:22.798 --> 16:26.602
Hey, that nanny doesn't
think I'm gay, does she?

16:29.105 --> 16:30.239
(Knocks on door)

16:30.239 --> 16:32.875
Amy, it's me, Riley.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.543
I need to talk to you.

16:37.947 --> 16:40.216
I probably wouldn't open
the door to me either.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.917
(Mumbles)

16:41.917 --> 16:44.086
I just came by to apologize.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.089
I'm sorry.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.225
You're right, I am a little jealous.

16:49.225 --> 16:50.926
But I miss my friend.

16:52.128 --> 16:55.498
But more than that, I'm really protective.

16:55.498 --> 16:58.667
I just want everyone to see
Danny the way that I see him,

16:58.667 --> 17:00.903
which... 

17:00.903 --> 17:03.005
is pretty near perfect.

17:03.005 --> 17:05.508
So he really is my hero.

17:05.508 --> 17:08.511
Excuse me, ma'am, is there a problem here?

17:08.511 --> 17:10.512
Oh my God! Super Danny!

17:10.512 --> 17:12.681
What are you doing here?

17:12.681 --> 17:14.150
I came to win back Amy.

17:14.150 --> 17:16.819
But you were right, she
needs to see the real me.

17:16.819 --> 17:18.154
I accepted who she was,

17:18.154 --> 17:19.922
now she needs to accept who I am.

17:19.922 --> 17:23.125
Are you sure you wanna have
this conversation in a unitard?

17:23.125 --> 17:25.094
It's the only way.

17:29.065 --> 17:30.733
Amy, it's me.

17:30.733 --> 17:32.068
We need to talk.

17:32.068 --> 17:33.102
(Screams)

17:33.102 --> 17:34.603
Amy! Stand back!

17:38.707 --> 17:40.176
Oh, my God. Danny.

17:40.176 --> 17:42.144
My door!

17:42.144 --> 17:44.080
I heard you scream. Are you all right?

17:44.080 --> 17:46.082
No. Look at me.

17:46.082 --> 17:48.851
I said sexed up, not jacked up!

17:48.851 --> 17:52.021
F.Y.I., it's customary
to tip as big as the hair.

17:52.021 --> 17:53.522
(Mouthing)

17:53.522 --> 17:55.691
(Sighs deeply) I... 

17:55.691 --> 17:57.860
I was just trying to loosen up a little.

17:57.860 --> 17:59.695
But I like you just the way you are.

17:59.695 --> 18:00.863
You do?

18:00.863 --> 18:03.165
Oh, because I like you just the way... 

18:03.165 --> 18:06.001
Why are you dressed like that?

18:06.001 --> 18:08.170
Because I wanted you to see the real me.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.006
Well, not the real real me.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.075
Can't really fly. Cape's just for show.

18:13.075 --> 18:14.043
(Giggles)

18:14.043 --> 18:16.045
Well, I like everything I see.

18:23.786 --> 18:26.021
Bonnie Wheeler... 

18:26.021 --> 18:28.657
changing lives one head at a time.

18:30.159 --> 18:32.495
I don't just do it... 

18:32.495 --> 18:34.497
I hair-do it.

18:39.034 --> 18:41.770
All right, there you go.

18:41.770 --> 18:42.938
Are you sure you're okay with opening up

18:42.938 --> 18:44.640
Half-O-Ween to outsiders?

18:44.640 --> 18:46.642
Maybe change is a good thing.

18:48.077 --> 18:50.146
- You ready?
- Amy: I think so.

18:50.146 --> 18:52.481
(Door opens)

18:55.050 --> 18:57.686
Okay!

18:57.686 --> 18:59.588
I take back what I said before.

18:59.588 --> 19:01.490
I think I might actually
like this look better.

19:02.825 --> 19:04.493
Mom, just let it go.

19:04.493 --> 19:06.962
Honestly, who gets thrown out of a daycare?

19:06.962 --> 19:08.531
I mean, she's not even one,

19:08.531 --> 19:09.999
and she already has a record.

19:09.999 --> 19:11.500
I'll switch my shifts if I have to.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.968
I'll make it work. I promise.

19:15.037 --> 19:16.872
Yeah?

19:16.872 --> 19:18.040
What do you think?

19:18.040 --> 19:19.909
Okay. (Chuckles)

19:19.909 --> 19:21.544
A mummy... I like it.

19:21.544 --> 19:23.879
Oh, I was going for
"crazy toilet paper guy."

19:23.879 --> 19:25.981
But mummy's better.

19:25.981 --> 19:28.083
(Knocks on door)

19:32.855 --> 19:33.856
Megan?

19:33.856 --> 19:36.859
Um, so not expecting for you to

19:36.859 --> 19:39.695
open the door dressed as... 

19:39.695 --> 19:41.497
What are you exactly?

19:41.497 --> 19:43.832
A kitchen robot.

19:43.832 --> 19:47.002
And of course you know my
trusty sidekick baby bot.

19:47.002 --> 19:48.637
(Robotic voice) Hello, Megan.

19:48.637 --> 19:49.838
(Chuckles weakly)

19:49.838 --> 19:51.140
(Normal voice) We're
going to a costume thing.

19:51.140 --> 19:53.676
I got that.

19:53.676 --> 19:55.678
You forgot Emma's diaper bag.

19:55.678 --> 19:57.546
Uh, you wanna just put it on the table?

19:57.546 --> 19:58.981
Thanks.

20:00.149 --> 20:02.017
All: Hey.

20:02.017 --> 20:03.552
(Door closes)

20:04.987 --> 20:07.790
Again, I'm sorry for lying.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.792
Pretty girls make me do stupid things... 

20:09.792 --> 20:11.026
you and Emma.

20:11.026 --> 20:12.695
Well, I guess

20:12.695 --> 20:14.897
I can't be too mad at a
guy who pretends to be gay

20:14.897 --> 20:17.533
just to get his little
girl into daycare, so... 

20:17.533 --> 20:19.902
So maybe we can start over over?

20:21.604 --> 20:23.072
Hi, I'm Ben Wheeler

20:23.072 --> 20:24.540
and this is Emma.

20:24.540 --> 20:27.176
Crazy, scheme-y, with
a smile I don't trust

20:27.176 --> 20:28.944
and spatulas for hands.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.614
(Robotic voice) I am in.

20:31.614 --> 20:33.048
(Chuckles)

20:33.048 --> 20:36.051
Could I interest you in a costume?

20:36.051 --> 20:37.653
I've got more tinfoil.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.555
(Chuckling) Okay.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.559
Mmm!

20:46.208 --> 20:48.210
To another successful adventure.

20:51.580 --> 20:53.616
You really are my hero, Wheeler.

20:53.616 --> 20:56.218
Do you think we're
getting too old for this?

20:56.218 --> 20:58.621
You're never too old to be yourself, right?

20:58.621 --> 21:01.624
So now that we've opened it up... 

21:01.624 --> 21:03.092
you think Half-O-Ween might catch on?

21:03.092 --> 21:04.593
Not a chance.

21:04.593 --> 21:05.561
And do we care?

21:05.561 --> 21:06.796
Not a bit.

21:09.098 --> 21:12.101
(Both in deep voice)
Happy Half-oO-Wween, New York!
