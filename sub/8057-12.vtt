WEBVTT

00:01.136 --> 00:04.388
I'm gonna get 12 eggs
and part of a dead animal.

00:04.389 --> 00:06.188
Dealer's choice.
Please and thank you.

00:06.189 --> 00:07.389
What can I get you, Ann?

00:07.390 --> 00:09.491
I will have oatmeal
and berries.

00:09.992 --> 00:12.825
And <i>I</i> will have catfish
and grits,

00:13.161 --> 00:14.261
with pumpernickel toast.

00:14.262 --> 00:15.329
Explain.

00:15.330 --> 00:16.680
Well, instead
of getting swept up

00:16.681 --> 00:18.482
in my boyfriends'
personalities,

00:18.483 --> 00:21.218
I am dating myself
and trying new things.

00:21.219 --> 00:22.386
So every time
I go out to eat,

00:22.387 --> 00:24.588
I order one thing
that's typical me

00:24.589 --> 00:26.923
and then something
that I would never order.

00:26.924 --> 00:28.758
Now I have two best friends,
Ann and Ann.

00:28.759 --> 00:30.292
Each one more beautiful
than the other.

00:30.293 --> 00:31.927
Oh, I also
have been documenting

00:31.928 --> 00:34.464
all the new things I'm trying
on my blog.

00:34.465 --> 00:35.465
Check this out.

00:35.466 --> 00:36.866
I went skydiving.

00:37.968 --> 00:40.102
Which Ann is screaming
like a maniac?

00:40.103 --> 00:42.739
Oatmeal Ann or catfish Ann?

00:42.740 --> 00:44.740
I'm not sure,
because I instantly blacked out

00:44.741 --> 00:45.807
from extreme terror.

00:51.414 --> 00:55.747

01:09.097 --> 01:11.164
Hey, I have an idea
for your blog.

01:11.165 --> 01:12.633
I think you should
take yourself ice-skating.

01:12.634 --> 01:13.768
That sounds fun.

01:13.769 --> 01:14.769
Yeah, we'll do a double date:

01:14.770 --> 01:15.902
You and you,
and me and Ben.

01:15.903 --> 01:16.936
But I have to warn you,

01:16.937 --> 01:17.937
I'm very good at ice-skating.

01:17.938 --> 01:19.171
I can do jumps.

01:19.172 --> 01:20.306
You know what?
I probably shouldn't come.

01:20.307 --> 01:21.908
I'll embarrass
the both of you.

01:21.909 --> 01:23.976
Actually, I know what
my next activity is gonna be.

01:23.977 --> 01:26.279
And it's a biggie.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.447
I want to be a mom.

01:27.448 --> 01:29.516
I'm going
to the sperm bank today.

01:29.517 --> 01:30.817
Can you come?

01:30.818 --> 01:31.983
Wow, today?

01:31.984 --> 01:35.020
Ann, you know
that I fully support

01:35.021 --> 01:36.488
any woman's decision--

01:36.489 --> 01:39.257
especially a beautiful
unicorn-nurse like yourself--

01:39.258 --> 01:41.493
in creating the family
that she wants.

01:41.494 --> 01:44.129
But you are so brilliant
and kind and stupid hot.

01:44.130 --> 01:45.363
I mean,
you're definitely gonna find

01:45.364 --> 01:47.532
a wonderful guy
who loves you and respects you

01:47.533 --> 01:50.134
and fills your home
with multi-ethnic genius babies.

01:50.135 --> 01:52.403
Maybe,
or maybe not.

01:52.404 --> 01:55.372
You hit the lottery with Ben,
and that's great,

01:55.373 --> 01:57.374
but not everybody's so lucky.

01:57.375 --> 01:58.843
I've wanted to be a mom
for a long time,

01:58.844 --> 02:00.878
I'm ready, and I think
I'd be good at it.

02:00.879 --> 02:03.314
Ann is giving up on love

02:03.315 --> 02:05.081
and deciding
to have a baby with herself.

02:05.082 --> 02:07.584
And she has only been
dating herself for six weeks.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.919
If she were dating a guy
for six weeks,

02:09.920 --> 02:11.421
and they decided
to have a kid,

02:11.422 --> 02:13.557
I'd be like,
"Congratulations, Ann...

02:13.558 --> 02:15.191
And Channing Tatum."

02:15.192 --> 02:16.526
Because that is
the only scenario

02:16.527 --> 02:18.161
that would make sense to me.

02:18.162 --> 02:21.263
What a gorgeous
herbaceous medley.

02:21.264 --> 02:22.731
There's been a mistake.

02:22.732 --> 02:26.001
You've accidentally given me
the food that my food eats.

02:26.002 --> 02:27.870
Salad is traditionally
the first course at a wedding.

02:27.871 --> 02:30.238
Is a gerbil marrying
a rabbit?

02:30.239 --> 02:31.907
I'm in charge of food
for the wedding.

02:31.908 --> 02:34.510
So I brought in
Pawnee's three best caterers

02:34.511 --> 02:36.611
and a panel of experts.

02:36.612 --> 02:38.412
Chris loves vegetables.

02:38.413 --> 02:40.114
Ron loves meat.

02:40.115 --> 02:42.917
And Tom considers himself
a foodie,

02:42.918 --> 02:45.620
which apparently means
taking instagrams of food

02:45.621 --> 02:46.754
instead of eating it.

02:46.755 --> 02:49.290
Okay, so I liked number one,

02:49.291 --> 02:50.592
Chris liked number two,

02:50.593 --> 02:52.993
and Ron liked number three.

02:52.994 --> 02:54.728
Tom, what about you?

02:54.729 --> 02:57.430
Caterer number one's
presentation was simple,

02:57.431 --> 02:58.832
mm, yet exhausting.

02:58.833 --> 03:02.166
Number two's was subtle
and provocative,

03:02.203 --> 03:04.571
like a coy Dutch woman
guarding a dark secret.

03:04.572 --> 03:06.206
Nothing you're saying
is helpful.

03:06.207 --> 03:08.374
But number three's told
a story--

03:08.375 --> 03:10.810
a story from a book
I wouldn't read

03:10.811 --> 03:13.012
but I would watch
the movie of.

03:13.013 --> 03:14.246
That's nonsense.

03:14.247 --> 03:15.681
You know what?

03:15.682 --> 03:17.016
I'm gonna go
with the first place.

03:17.017 --> 03:18.518
I really loved that appetizer.

03:18.519 --> 03:19.685
Oh, the mini-calzone?

03:19.686 --> 03:20.753
I wouldn't call it that.

03:20.754 --> 03:22.488
It was more like
a savory pastry.

03:22.489 --> 03:24.656
Delicate little dough pocket

03:24.657 --> 03:27.792
filled with tomato sauce,
cheese, and seasoned meat.

03:27.793 --> 03:30.094
Just a stunning
culinary innovation.

03:30.095 --> 03:31.696
It was a calzone.

03:31.697 --> 03:33.732
It was literally
just a small calzone.

03:33.733 --> 03:36.234
Let me just get some details
for your file.

03:36.235 --> 03:37.502
Now, are you two a couple?

03:37.503 --> 03:40.203
No. Tragically,
we are both heterosexual.

03:40.204 --> 03:42.239
So, Ann, what
are you looking for

03:42.240 --> 03:43.707
in particular?

03:43.708 --> 03:45.876
Some sperm.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.444
I meant
in terms of a donor?

03:47.445 --> 03:50.998
Oh, you know, nice guy...
Nice sperm.

03:51.082 --> 03:52.282
Flip through this binder,

03:52.283 --> 03:53.984
make a note
of anyone who interests you,

03:53.985 --> 03:56.452
and I'll be back shortly.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.187
Oh!
This guy went to Harvard!

03:58.188 --> 03:59.288
So did the Unabomber.

03:59.289 --> 04:00.322
This guys seems healthy.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.323
Loves cycling.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.792
Yeah, so did Lance Armstrong,

04:02.793 --> 04:04.427
and he turned out
to be a lying drug user.

04:04.428 --> 04:05.628
Or a hero.

04:05.629 --> 04:07.229
I don't know where we stand
on him now.

04:07.230 --> 04:08.264
Hello, ladies.

04:08.265 --> 04:09.465
Fancy meeting you here.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.600
Whoa, Sewage Joe.

04:11.601 --> 04:13.401
Wow. Ann, you remember
Joe Fantringham.

04:13.402 --> 04:15.537
He is the gentleman
who was fired

04:15.538 --> 04:16.872
for emailing
a picture of his penis

04:16.873 --> 04:17.940
to every woman in city hall.

04:17.940 --> 04:19.140
Guilty.

04:19.141 --> 04:20.676
Yeah, that's what
the judge said.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.244
- Mmhmm.
- Joe, you are a donor here, huh?

04:23.245 --> 04:24.345
Did you hear that, Ann?

04:24.346 --> 04:25.847
Big time,
me and all my buddies.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.782
Free money, free porn.

04:27.783 --> 04:29.383
Best job I ever had.

04:29.384 --> 04:30.785
Also...

04:30.786 --> 04:32.954
If you're looking
to buy some weed,

04:32.955 --> 04:35.155
I'm looking as well.

04:36.425 --> 04:37.894
- Shall we?
- Yup.

04:39.895 --> 04:42.797
Okay, Leslie Knope outfit
number eight.

04:42.798 --> 04:44.664
Babe, you look super hot.

04:44.665 --> 04:46.800
You realize you've said that
about all of them?

04:46.801 --> 04:47.968
Well, she has,
every single time.

04:47.969 --> 04:49.636
'Cause she is super hot.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.905
Honestly,
you'd look hot naked.

04:51.906 --> 04:55.239
Ugh. This suit makes me want
to scold a Catholic child.

04:55.676 --> 04:57.644
I don't know who Ann Taylor is,

04:57.645 --> 04:59.145
but I hate her
and I want to kill her.

04:59.146 --> 05:02.147
I have to lead a public forum
for the Pawnee Commons

05:02.148 --> 05:03.448
every day this week,

05:03.449 --> 05:06.051
and I hate talking to people.

05:06.052 --> 05:07.285
So, to get through it,

05:07.286 --> 05:08.988
I figured
I'm just gonna basically try

05:08.989 --> 05:10.188
to imitate Leslie.

05:10.889 --> 05:12.491
She still wears this.

05:12.492 --> 05:13.892
She had the patch sewn in.

05:13.893 --> 05:15.594
You can't remove it.

05:15.595 --> 05:17.495
What's in the pocket, you ask?

05:17.496 --> 05:20.829
A ticket stub from
a Fleetwood Mac concert in 1995,

05:21.033 --> 05:22.335
and...

05:24.336 --> 05:25.737
This one <i>is</i> terrible,

05:25.738 --> 05:28.405
but it is slightly less terrible
than the rest.

05:28.406 --> 05:31.242
So tomorrow,
I lead a public forum

05:31.243 --> 05:33.176
in Leslie's Fleetwood Mac
sex pants.

05:33.177 --> 05:35.411
Fleetwood Mac Sex Pants.
New band name. I call it.

05:35.412 --> 05:36.747
Ooh, you know what?

05:36.748 --> 05:40.081
Maybe just Fleetwood Mac.

05:40.351 --> 05:41.685
So what's the next move?

05:41.686 --> 05:43.186
Is there, like,
a better sperm bank

05:43.187 --> 05:44.487
in Eagleton or something?

05:44.488 --> 05:45.989
Um, you don't want
a demon baby.

05:45.990 --> 05:47.190
Look, you're Ann Perkins.

05:47.191 --> 05:48.858
Sperm that is worthy
of your perfect eggs

05:48.859 --> 05:50.192
does not grow on trees.

05:50.193 --> 05:51.593
I think, ideally,

05:51.594 --> 05:53.729
you'd want
to know the guy, right?

05:53.730 --> 05:55.197
You'd want
to know his personality,

05:55.198 --> 05:57.232
his favorite season
of <i>Friends,</i>

05:57.233 --> 05:59.101
whether or not he hates jazz--
hopefully, he does.

05:59.102 --> 06:00.269
You'd want to know him.

06:00.270 --> 06:02.138
Yes, Leslie,
you're totally right.

06:02.139 --> 06:03.472
I'm gonna go home,

06:03.473 --> 06:04.839
and I'm gonna make a list

06:04.840 --> 06:07.108
of all the guys I already know
who could be donors.

06:07.109 --> 06:08.977
And then,
I'm gonna call them

06:08.978 --> 06:10.145
and tell them
I'm doing some blog entry

06:10.146 --> 06:11.980
on men's health or something.

06:11.981 --> 06:13.948
I can interview them
and ask them whatever I want.

06:13.949 --> 06:15.249
You're a genius!

06:15.250 --> 06:16.284
This is your idea,
and I love it.

06:16.285 --> 06:17.318
I'll call you later.

06:17.319 --> 06:18.920
No.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.754
If I don't slow
this baby train down,

06:20.755 --> 06:23.290
Ann may end up having a baby
with some random weirdo

06:23.291 --> 06:24.558
instead of her soul mate.

06:24.559 --> 06:25.625
I fully believe

06:25.626 --> 06:26.760
that a woman
should be in charge

06:26.761 --> 06:28.195
of what happens
to her body.

06:28.196 --> 06:30.330
In this case,
the body is Ann's,

06:30.331 --> 06:32.566
and the woman
in charge of it is me.

06:34.660 --> 06:35.909
I was up all night brainstorming

06:35.910 --> 06:37.709
and this is
the complete official list

06:37.710 --> 06:40.046
of candidates
for Ann's baby daddy.

06:40.047 --> 06:42.381
Wow, how did you come up
with these three names?

06:42.632 --> 06:44.767
Well, I eliminated everyone
in a relationship

06:44.768 --> 06:45.967
and the obvious "No" s,

06:45.968 --> 06:48.036
like Knuckle-hair Dave
from HR.

06:48.037 --> 06:49.171
I don't mind the knuckle hair.

06:49.172 --> 06:50.772
- I just think he's a dick.
- Yeah.

06:50.773 --> 06:52.774
And I was left
with those three guys.

06:52.775 --> 06:54.742
Don't forget, they don't know
about the sperm donor thing.

06:54.743 --> 06:56.076
I don't want them to know.

06:56.077 --> 06:57.812
I told them I was
interviewing them for a blog.

06:57.813 --> 06:59.314
Here comes the first one.
Dr. Harris!

06:59.315 --> 07:00.315
- H-hey, there he is.
- Hi.

07:00.316 --> 07:01.783
Ann, Leslie.

07:02.284 --> 07:03.651
Small office.
Mine's way bigger.

07:03.652 --> 07:06.120
Is this gonna take long?
Got a patient coming in.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.488
No, not at all.
Please have a seat.

07:08.489 --> 07:10.190
Actually, maybe you should
check in on your patient.

07:10.191 --> 07:12.225
I know that I hate it
when my doctor makes me wait.

07:12.226 --> 07:13.460
Guy's got a spinal fracture.

07:13.461 --> 07:14.494
He's not going anywhere.

07:14.495 --> 07:16.129
- Uh-huh.
- Ooh.

07:16.130 --> 07:17.997
The seats in my office
are leather.

07:17.998 --> 07:19.999
Okay.

07:23.937 --> 07:25.037
Chris?

07:25.338 --> 07:27.039
I'm dying.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.741
I was dying earlier today.

07:29.242 --> 07:30.876
And then I died.

07:31.377 --> 07:32.577
Now I'm dead.

07:32.578 --> 07:33.846
I had to cancel a date

07:33.847 --> 07:35.548
with Shauna Malwae-Tweep.

07:35.549 --> 07:36.849
And I really like her.

07:37.350 --> 07:39.352
Do you think
she'll still like me

07:39.353 --> 07:40.385
now that I'm dead?

07:40.386 --> 07:41.986
What is this?

07:41.987 --> 07:45.089
It's food poisoning.
I have it too.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.109
I did not sleep
for one second last night.

07:48.110 --> 07:50.177
And I cracked the bottom
of the toilet bowl.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.778
Oh, God, don't say that.

07:51.779 --> 07:53.446
Has anybody talked to Tom?

07:53.447 --> 07:54.915
I can't even imagine

07:54.916 --> 07:57.250
what that tiny little man
must be feeling like.

07:57.251 --> 07:58.852
I have voided more
than Tom's body weight

07:58.853 --> 08:01.121
in the last 12 hours alone.

08:01.122 --> 08:02.956
He might have just disappeared
off the earth.

08:02.957 --> 08:05.759
We need to call him.
We must reach out to him.

08:09.596 --> 08:11.530
I can't do it.

08:22.308 --> 08:24.909
Ben, extension 7820.

08:36.721 --> 08:38.023
Hello, everyone.

08:38.024 --> 08:40.423
I'm April Ludgate
from the Parks Department.

08:40.424 --> 08:44.657
And welcome to a public forum
about the Pawnee Commons.

08:44.729 --> 08:47.531
As Eleanor Roosevelt once said

08:47.532 --> 08:50.433
to Betty Ford...

08:50.434 --> 08:52.302
"Hillary Clinton is great."

08:52.803 --> 08:56.136
Now, if you all would
kindly look under your chairs,

08:56.506 --> 08:58.507
you will find
a special surprise--

08:58.508 --> 09:00.977
a flyer with details
about the project,

09:00.978 --> 09:03.379
and... Friendship bands

09:03.380 --> 09:05.682
that I've made
for each and every one of you.

09:05.683 --> 09:08.985
So now,
I guess we're Park Pals.

09:08.986 --> 09:10.752
You should see the booger
under this chair.

09:11.253 --> 09:12.154
Andy.

09:12.655 --> 09:14.389
It's nice
to see you again, Ann.

09:14.390 --> 09:15.557
I was happy to get the call.

09:15.558 --> 09:17.859
- Yeah, Pete, you look great.
- Aww.

09:17.860 --> 09:20.495
So are you still
dunking basketballs?

09:20.496 --> 09:22.097
You know, I'm a lot more

09:22.098 --> 09:24.299
than just a former
high school basketball star.

09:24.300 --> 09:27.034
I teach marketing over
at Pawnee Community College.

09:27.035 --> 09:28.869
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

09:28.870 --> 09:32.203
Would you say
you value education?

09:33.374 --> 09:35.509
I see what's going on here.

09:35.510 --> 09:37.078
You want my sperm.

09:37.079 --> 09:39.613
What?
What are you talking about?

09:39.614 --> 09:40.748
When will women
in this town

09:40.749 --> 09:43.583
stop scheming
to get my sperm?

09:43.584 --> 09:44.951
Wow.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.187
That son of a bitch is astute.

09:47.188 --> 09:48.554
Okay, all I need to do

09:48.555 --> 09:50.289
is just shoot
one more person down

09:50.290 --> 09:51.624
and then I can
buy some time

09:51.625 --> 09:54.958
and convince Ann to wait
for her own Ben-level soul mate.

09:55.529 --> 09:58.264
The last guy
is Howard Tuttleman.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.664
I know that name.

09:59.665 --> 10:01.133
How do I know that name?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.567
I know it's a winter's morn,

10:02.568 --> 10:04.302
but it feels
like a summer's eve,

10:04.303 --> 10:06.972
'cause "the douche"
is in the building.

10:06.973 --> 10:09.975
What's up, ladies?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.712
Oh, whoa!

10:13.713 --> 10:15.479
Smells like some vomit
took a dump in here.

10:15.480 --> 10:16.513
What happened?

10:16.514 --> 10:18.315
We got food poisoning, Tom.

10:18.316 --> 10:19.383
Yuck.

10:19.384 --> 10:21.318
How do you
not have food poisoning?

10:21.319 --> 10:23.121
Because he didn't eat
anything.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.388
He just took pictures

10:24.389 --> 10:26.557
and talked
about the "wow" factor.

10:26.558 --> 10:28.192
Not true.
I ate everything you did.

10:28.193 --> 10:29.393
Are you sure?

10:29.394 --> 10:31.061
Is there anything
that you didn't eat?

10:31.062 --> 10:32.295
Oh, yeah.

10:32.296 --> 10:33.496
I didn't eat
those stupid mini-calzones.

10:33.497 --> 10:35.932
Haver-food rule number six--

10:35.933 --> 10:38.135
never eat anything with
a sauce I have to dip myself.

10:38.136 --> 10:39.535
Drizzle it on for me.

10:39.536 --> 10:41.104
I'm not your maid.

10:41.105 --> 10:44.107
The calzones... betrayed me?

10:44.108 --> 10:45.642
Never again, guys.

10:45.643 --> 10:47.676
As God as my witness,

10:47.677 --> 10:48.978
they're dead to me.

10:48.979 --> 10:51.147
All right, well,
Tommy feels great.

10:51.148 --> 10:53.249
And I'm about
to go eat some lasagna.

10:53.250 --> 10:54.416
Peace!

10:56.419 --> 10:59.288
I'm afraid this park
will raise my taxes.

10:59.289 --> 11:00.990
Ah, well, fear not.

11:00.991 --> 11:03.291
Between the normal Parks budget
and our corporate partners--

11:03.292 --> 11:05.626
- I'm also afraid
the park will be noisy.

11:05.627 --> 11:07.095
And full of spiders.

11:07.096 --> 11:08.496
And dark at nighttime.

11:08.497 --> 11:10.598
I'm scared of a lot of stuff.

11:10.599 --> 11:12.267
Everything's fine.

11:12.268 --> 11:14.468
I'm fine.
I'm Walter, and I'm fine.

11:14.469 --> 11:16.537
Is this gonna be
a topless park?

11:16.538 --> 11:19.306
I don't think there are
topless parks.

11:19.307 --> 11:21.175
Well, let's build
the first one

11:21.176 --> 11:22.810
and be heroes.

11:22.811 --> 11:24.377
If this is going to be
a topless park,

11:24.378 --> 11:26.180
I won't sign your petition.

11:26.181 --> 11:27.915
If she's going
to the topless park,

11:27.916 --> 11:31.249
I'm not signing
the topless park petition.

11:31.719 --> 11:33.854
You know, I take that back,
I'm still in.

11:33.855 --> 11:35.387
What's up?
I'm Harris.

11:35.388 --> 11:38.257
Yeah, yeah. Forget whatever
that Pawnee Commons is.

11:38.258 --> 11:39.391
I'm with that pervert.

11:39.392 --> 11:41.660
Topless park.
Topless park!

11:41.661 --> 11:44.463
- Topless park!
- Topless park!

11:44.464 --> 11:46.165
Where'd you go
to school again?

11:46.166 --> 11:48.400
Northwestern.
I studied semiotics.

11:48.401 --> 11:51.402
Wrote a thesis on narrative
forms in the digital world.

11:51.403 --> 11:53.004
Then you became
a morning shock-jock

11:53.005 --> 11:56.107
and created
the sport "taint ball"?

11:56.108 --> 11:57.742
Yeah. You know,
the douche persona

11:57.743 --> 11:59.544
is something I came up with
during college.

11:59.545 --> 12:01.379
It started as satire,

12:01.380 --> 12:03.248
and, you know, we snowballed
to where we are today.

12:03.249 --> 12:04.850
I mean, I know it's
a silly thing to do,

12:04.851 --> 12:06.351
but it pays the bills.

12:06.352 --> 12:07.818
Well, I think, you probably
need to get back to the studio,

12:07.819 --> 12:10.520
play some fart jokes,
make fun of some immigrants.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.523
Actually, a farting immigrant
segment would be really funny.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.125
<i>Ay dios...</i>

12:16.126 --> 12:17.494
Good looking out, Leslie.

12:17.495 --> 12:19.129
You guys ever want
to do this again,

12:19.130 --> 12:21.098
sans clothing,
give me a shout.

12:21.099 --> 12:22.999
- Gross.
- That was the douche talking.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.767
Honestly, good luck
on this project.

12:24.768 --> 12:26.535
It sounds really interesting.

12:26.536 --> 12:28.137
I'm gonna scan a quick pic
of them boobies

12:28.138 --> 12:31.307
for a little deposit
in "El banco de spanko."

12:31.308 --> 12:32.842
That was the douche talking.

12:32.843 --> 12:34.110
Douche nation.

12:34.111 --> 12:36.079
You guys know
where the library is?

12:36.080 --> 12:38.281
Wow.
Okay, that's not gonna work.

12:38.282 --> 12:39.748
Back to the drawing board.

12:39.749 --> 12:41.416
No need.
I choose Howard.

12:41.417 --> 12:43.252
You want to have a baby
with the douche?

12:43.253 --> 12:45.120
His name's Howard Tuttleman,
Leslie.

12:45.121 --> 12:47.256
And I know he plays
that obnoxious character

12:47.257 --> 12:49.057
on the radio,
but he's a good guy,

12:49.058 --> 12:50.592
his family is healthy,

12:50.593 --> 12:52.460
and he is successful
and smart.

12:52.461 --> 12:54.129
Ann, you cannot be serious.

12:54.130 --> 12:56.197
I am.
And I've made my decision.

12:56.198 --> 12:58.900
- I am sure of it.
Okay.

12:58.901 --> 13:01.102
Douche!
Hey, douche!

13:01.603 --> 13:02.803
Councilman Howser.

13:02.804 --> 13:04.305
Councilwoman Knope.

13:04.306 --> 13:05.773
'Sup, Leslie?

13:05.774 --> 13:08.376
You wanna funk this junk
in the back of my trunk?

13:08.377 --> 13:10.144
That was the douche talking.

13:10.145 --> 13:12.279
Okay, look,
Ann is not interviewing you

13:12.280 --> 13:13.613
for her blog.

13:13.614 --> 13:15.015
She's thinking
about having a baby,

13:15.016 --> 13:18.118
and she's considering you
as a possible donor.

13:18.119 --> 13:19.119
Wow.

13:20.521 --> 13:22.755
You know, I've thought a lot
about having kids.

13:22.756 --> 13:24.357
It's the next big step

13:24.358 --> 13:26.592
in this grand adventure
that we call life.

13:26.593 --> 13:27.692
Frankly, I don't think
you would be

13:27.693 --> 13:28.794
the right man for the job.

13:28.795 --> 13:29.962
Well, frankly,

13:29.963 --> 13:31.063
I don't think
it's for you to decide.

13:31.064 --> 13:32.697
You know, if we had
a little girl,

13:32.698 --> 13:34.499
I would name her Elizabeth,
after my grandmother.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.602
She was this strong,
amazing woman.

13:37.603 --> 13:39.471
And if we had a boy,

13:39.472 --> 13:40.739
I don't know,
I'd name him something funny,

13:40.740 --> 13:42.641
like "Dick" or "O. J."

13:43.708 --> 13:45.276
Guess I have
a lot to consider.

13:45.277 --> 13:46.495
My God.

13:46.946 --> 13:49.981
I have driven Ann right
into the belly of the douche.

13:51.283 --> 13:52.782
- Hey, what's up?
- Oh, nothing.

13:52.783 --> 13:53.883
I was listening
to the radio

13:53.884 --> 13:55.084
on my way here,

13:55.085 --> 13:56.152
and I heard something
very interesting.

13:56.153 --> 13:58.020
So, Crazy Ira,

13:58.021 --> 13:59.489
remember that chick Ann
I used to...

14:01.541 --> 14:03.476
Yeah, she was smoking hot!

14:04.979 --> 14:09.280
Turns out, she wants
to have <i>my</i> baby.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.250
Anyway, her lesbo friend
tells me

14:12.251 --> 14:14.519
she's on the prowl
for some baby beans...

14:15.888 --> 14:18.356
And it's down to me
and some other turd-munchers.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.493
Wow.
You should be angry.

14:22.494 --> 14:24.128
I can't believe
Howard did that to you.

14:24.129 --> 14:26.998
I can't believe
<i>you</i> did that to me.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.734
I am making
a very important life decision,

14:29.735 --> 14:31.301
and you betrayed me.

14:31.302 --> 14:32.703
Because I thought
you were making a huge mistake.

14:32.704 --> 14:33.938
Look, I get it.

14:33.939 --> 14:35.172
I know you're frustrated
with dating,

14:35.173 --> 14:36.741
and you think you're
not gonna meet someone,

14:36.742 --> 14:38.574
but two years ago,
I didn't think

14:38.575 --> 14:40.176
I would meet someone like Ben,
and I did.

14:40.177 --> 14:41.577
My idea of a perfect family

14:41.578 --> 14:43.947
does not require a soul mate.

14:43.948 --> 14:46.783
I want a baby, that's it,
accept it.

14:48.318 --> 14:49.886
Councilman Milton,
do we have a meeting?

14:49.887 --> 14:51.154
Oh, no, no, no.

14:51.155 --> 14:53.689
I just wanted to toss
my name into the ring,

14:53.690 --> 14:57.023
in respect
to this Indian woman's vagina.

14:59.495 --> 15:01.630
Hey, how was the forum?

15:01.631 --> 15:03.431
Um, crappy.

15:03.432 --> 15:05.467
We only got four signatures.

15:05.468 --> 15:06.802
Two of them were me and Andy,

15:06.803 --> 15:09.138
and one of them
said "Farts McCool."

15:09.139 --> 15:11.673
I just don't know
how Leslie can be Leslie

15:11.674 --> 15:12.840
all the time.

15:12.841 --> 15:16.174
I was her for two hours
and I want to die.

15:16.444 --> 15:17.611
Well, you know what?

15:17.612 --> 15:19.047
We've got another forum today.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.149
Let's just hop back
in that saddle.

15:21.150 --> 15:23.084
What should I do?
Should I wear a blonde wig?

15:23.085 --> 15:24.152
Oh, my God, yes.

15:24.153 --> 15:26.653
- That would be so hot.
- Andy.

15:26.654 --> 15:28.188
If you think--if you--
do you think it would help?

15:28.189 --> 15:30.456
I mean, if you think
it'd help you.

15:31.625 --> 15:33.493
Well, I'm feeling
so much better.

15:33.494 --> 15:36.529
Almost no weird stuff snuck out
of my body last night.

15:36.530 --> 15:38.264
And I feel like the emptiness
of my stomach

15:38.265 --> 15:39.966
is gonna lead
to a pretty epic breakfast.

15:39.967 --> 15:41.168
Guys, what do I do?

15:41.169 --> 15:42.968
My choice almost killed us,

15:42.969 --> 15:45.304
and we can't agree
on another one, so--

15:45.305 --> 15:46.872
Maybe there's
a catering company

15:46.873 --> 15:49.175
in Snerling
that we should look into.

15:49.176 --> 15:50.876
No, it has to be
from Pawnee.

15:50.877 --> 15:51.977
I just know
that's what Leslie wants.

15:51.978 --> 15:52.978
I got it.

15:52.979 --> 15:54.313
This might sound crazy,

15:54.314 --> 15:57.449
but Jean-Ralphio has started
a catering company.

15:57.450 --> 15:58.883
He has?

15:58.884 --> 16:00.118
Now, granted,
he is currently

16:00.119 --> 16:01.452
standing trial
for counterfeiting Euros,

16:01.453 --> 16:03.722
but the trial's
gonna be over quick.

16:03.723 --> 16:04.956
He's definitely guilty.

16:04.957 --> 16:06.289
Ugh, forget it.

16:06.290 --> 16:09.593
Dry toast
and half a grapefruit for Chris.

16:09.594 --> 16:10.694
Thank you.

16:10.695 --> 16:11.995
- Egg whites for Ben.
- Thank you.

16:11.996 --> 16:13.964
Egg whites for Tom,

16:13.965 --> 16:17.298
and pretty much
everything we make for Ron.

16:17.335 --> 16:18.568
And don't you go sneaking off.

16:18.569 --> 16:21.205
I'm sending home
some free waffles for Leslie.

16:21.206 --> 16:23.639
Thanks, JJ.
You're the best.

16:26.076 --> 16:27.610
Okay, we're back.

16:27.611 --> 16:30.613
We, uh, got an update
on "Operation...

16:30.614 --> 16:32.014
Baby douche."

16:33.383 --> 16:36.716
All right, special guest
is Councilwoman Leslie Knope.

16:36.854 --> 16:38.987
- How are you, les?
- "Me so horny."

16:38.988 --> 16:40.021
That was not me.

16:40.022 --> 16:41.089
That was
a farcical sound effect.

16:41.090 --> 16:42.590
Did she say "fartsicle"?

16:43.993 --> 16:47.195
The fartsicle.
Frozen farts you can eat.

16:47.196 --> 16:50.031
Put it in your face-mouth!

16:50.032 --> 16:52.033
It's cold and it smells.

16:52.034 --> 16:53.768
God, how did you make that
so fast?

16:53.769 --> 16:55.469
Anyway, look, I am here

16:55.470 --> 16:56.570
because I want you
to stop talking

16:56.571 --> 16:58.405
about my friend's womb.

16:58.406 --> 16:59.907
Sorry, Councilwoman.
I'm in it to win it.

16:59.908 --> 17:01.341
The douche is gonna be
a daddy.

17:01.342 --> 17:04.675
And Crazy Ira's gonna be
the creepy Uncle.

17:04.780 --> 17:06.213
Okay, all right.

17:06.214 --> 17:07.982
Look, she is
a wonderful person,

17:07.983 --> 17:09.282
and she does not
deserve this.

17:09.284 --> 17:10.383
So I need you to lay off.

17:10.384 --> 17:12.117
Okay, I will lay off

17:12.118 --> 17:15.452
if you can survive one round
with Breasty Bertha in...

17:16.757 --> 17:18.523
The Jell-o Pit!

17:18.525 --> 17:21.359
Rudy! Get in the Jell-o.

17:21.361 --> 17:23.296
Okay, I am
a city councilwoman,

17:23.297 --> 17:24.396
so I am not gonna
Jell-o wrestle.

17:24.397 --> 17:25.598
I mean, this is fun.

17:25.598 --> 17:26.865
Don't you want
your constituents to know

17:26.866 --> 17:28.200
that you got a fun side?

17:28.201 --> 17:29.935
Yeah, show your fun sides.

17:29.936 --> 17:31.536
This is not about me
and my constituents!

17:31.537 --> 17:33.338
This is about you talking
about my friend.

17:33.339 --> 17:35.274
All right, I will stop talking
about your friend

17:35.275 --> 17:36.942
if you get in that Jell-o
for one second

17:36.943 --> 17:38.243
- and say, "Rudy."
- Rudy.

17:38.244 --> 17:40.212
- 'Cause <i> The Cosby Show.</i>
- Classic.

17:40.213 --> 17:41.513
Classic.

17:41.514 --> 17:43.181
Fine, I will stand there
for one second

17:43.182 --> 17:44.348
and say it,
and then we're done.

17:44.349 --> 17:45.716
- Fair's fair.
- Fair's fair.

17:45.717 --> 17:47.718
Somebody get me
a pudding pop.

17:47.719 --> 17:48.752
Oh!

17:48.753 --> 17:51.923
Yeah!

17:52.224 --> 17:53.057
Rudy.

17:53.058 --> 17:54.258
There, happy?

17:54.259 --> 17:57.592
No, say it like Bill Cosby.

17:57.696 --> 18:00.263
Rudy.

18:00.264 --> 18:02.098
- I don't know.
- Yeah!

18:02.099 --> 18:03.700
Oh, she's touching
her boobs now.

18:03.701 --> 18:05.501
No, I'm not.
I'm just standing here.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.871
And I am leaving, just like
you're gonna leave Ann alone.

18:09.606 --> 18:10.773
Oh, she's in there!

18:10.774 --> 18:11.942
She's into it now!

18:11.943 --> 18:13.509
Oh, Rudy has fallen
into the Jell-o.

18:14.744 --> 18:16.611
Theo, now there's Jell-o

18:16.612 --> 18:18.814
all over
my favorite sweater.

18:18.815 --> 18:20.082
And the gold medal

18:20.083 --> 18:23.052
goes to Leslie Knope!

18:23.053 --> 18:24.553
Okay, can you give me
that bag?

18:24.554 --> 18:26.255
I have to go change
into my Leslie suit.

18:26.256 --> 18:28.157
You got it, babe.

18:28.158 --> 18:29.325
Thanks.

18:30.726 --> 18:31.993
Andy!

18:31.994 --> 18:33.661
- What?
- This is the wrong bag.

18:33.662 --> 18:34.896
What?

18:34.897 --> 18:35.930
This bag is full
of Fruit Roll-Ups

18:35.931 --> 18:37.065
and baseball cards.

18:37.066 --> 18:38.967
I don't have
my Leslie pantsuit

18:38.968 --> 18:40.835
or my Leslie headband
or my Leslie notes.

18:40.836 --> 18:43.037
I can't do this meeting
without my Leslie stuff.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.638
- Honey, I am so sorry.
- Andy!

18:44.639 --> 18:45.740
I guess
I must have screwed up.

18:45.741 --> 18:47.374
Look, you look amazing
in this outfit.

18:47.375 --> 18:49.977
Plus you're the smartest person
on the planet.

18:49.978 --> 18:51.578
I think you can do this
just being yourself.

18:55.616 --> 18:56.984
Yeah, so how much money

18:56.985 --> 19:00.053
is this whole Pawnee Commons
project gonna cost me?

19:00.054 --> 19:01.355
Uh, good question.

19:01.356 --> 19:04.490
40% will be coming
from our corporate partners,

19:04.491 --> 19:06.425
- and another 30%--
- Excuse me, ma'am.

19:06.426 --> 19:08.094
I didn't ask
for a math lesson.

19:08.095 --> 19:10.562
So why don't you just tell me
how much it's gonna cost me?

19:10.563 --> 19:13.632
And don't use numbers.

19:13.633 --> 19:16.235
Look, you won't have
to pay any extra money, okay?

19:16.236 --> 19:18.069
And don't ever
call me "ma'am" again.

19:18.070 --> 19:20.105
Thanks.
Next question.

19:20.106 --> 19:22.740
Yeah, I wanted to talk more
about that topless park idea

19:22.741 --> 19:24.910
that a local hero
brought up yesterday.

19:24.911 --> 19:26.378
Yeah, there's not gonna be
a topless park, Harris.

19:26.379 --> 19:28.446
Nobody wants
your creepy stoner eyes

19:28.447 --> 19:30.181
staring at them while
they're enjoying a park, okay?

19:30.182 --> 19:32.450
Stop being gross.

19:32.951 --> 19:34.285
Yeah.

19:34.286 --> 19:36.020
Shut me down!

19:36.021 --> 19:37.288
You scare me,

19:37.289 --> 19:40.190
and I gotta say,
I kinda dig that.

19:40.191 --> 19:41.458
What's your deal?

19:41.959 --> 19:43.794
She's married to me.

19:43.795 --> 19:45.662
I heard you on the radio.

19:45.663 --> 19:47.798
- Thanks for doing that.
- Got dicey.

19:47.799 --> 19:49.733
But they did invite me
to participate

19:49.734 --> 19:51.634
in their
topless Jell-o-lympics...

19:51.635 --> 19:53.970
- Oh.
- So that's something.

19:53.971 --> 19:56.973
It is possible
that you were right.

19:56.974 --> 20:00.176
This is obviously
a huge decision,

20:00.177 --> 20:02.378
and I should take my time.

20:02.379 --> 20:03.846
I want you
to be happy, you know?

20:03.847 --> 20:05.181
I-I guess I just didn't consider

20:05.182 --> 20:06.448
that you would take
a different path than I did.

20:06.449 --> 20:08.817
I tried
to impose my dream on you,

20:08.818 --> 20:10.118
and that's wrong.

20:10.119 --> 20:11.186
And I'm sorry.

20:11.187 --> 20:12.554
But I think you do need

20:12.555 --> 20:14.056
to take a little bit more time
with this decision.

20:14.057 --> 20:16.258
Maybe employ
a more methodical approach.

20:16.259 --> 20:19.592
One that involves
color-coded binders.

20:20.330 --> 20:22.029
Is that a drawing

20:22.030 --> 20:24.798
of my reproductive system
saying "Let's do this"?

20:24.799 --> 20:27.634
The Knope way involves
a lot of uterine cartoons.

20:27.635 --> 20:28.669
What can I tell you?

20:28.670 --> 20:30.571
Besides,
what is more cuter-us

20:30.572 --> 20:31.973
than your uterus?

20:32.474 --> 20:34.075
- You ready, Ann?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

20:34.076 --> 20:35.642
- We're in it now.
- Yes, we are.

20:35.643 --> 20:36.777
Let's make a baby together.

20:37.278 --> 20:38.511
You should phrase that
differently.

20:38.512 --> 20:39.545
Right.

20:40.762 --> 20:42.509
Are you sure you're cool
with JJ's Diner

20:42.510 --> 20:44.077
catering what
you've referred to

20:44.078 --> 20:45.745
as "The wedding
of the millennium"?

20:45.996 --> 20:47.479
Are you kidding me?

20:47.480 --> 20:50.081
I thought that I could not love
you any more than I already did.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.518
But I was dead wrong.

20:53.369 --> 20:56.702
- Is that smoke?
- Hmm?

20:57.189 --> 21:00.358
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Celebrating.

21:00.359 --> 21:03.027
We got 80 signatures
and, like, 30 complaints

21:03.028 --> 21:04.662
of excessive rudeness,
but who cares?

21:04.663 --> 21:06.330
Yeah, you should have
seen her, Leslie.

21:06.331 --> 21:09.166
She was awesome.
So smart, so hot, so mean.

21:09.167 --> 21:11.701
I wanted to bone her right there
in that dirty church basement.

21:11.702 --> 21:13.220
No, what are you doing?

21:13.221 --> 21:16.554
Uh, we are burning
this awful pantsuit.

21:16.558 --> 21:17.725
That's mine.

21:17.726 --> 21:19.059
I wanted that back.

21:19.460 --> 21:21.260
Well, frankly,
you should have thought of that

21:21.261 --> 21:22.929
before we burned it.
