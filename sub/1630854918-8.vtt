00:02.570 --> 00:04.872
<i>I'm Harry Tasker,
husband, dad, computer salesman,</i>

00:04.972 --> 00:08.109
<i>and for 17 years the most
important person in my life</i>

00:08.209 --> 00:10.044
<i>didn't know
I was also something else.</i>

00:11.045 --> 00:13.281
<i>Omega Sector's top spy.</i>

00:13.381 --> 00:15.015
<i>I'm Helen Tasker,</i>

00:15.116 --> 00:16.784
<i>wife, mom and professor.</i>

00:16.884 --> 00:18.619
<i>After an unfortunate incident</i>

00:18.719 --> 00:21.155
<i>where I found out
our whole life was a lie,</i>

00:21.255 --> 00:23.824
<i>now I'm also a spy.</i>

00:24.692 --> 00:26.694
<i>Honey, all those things
are true.</i>

00:26.794 --> 00:28.396
<i>They're just, you know...
What?</i>

00:28.496 --> 00:30.798
<i>True lies.</i>

00:30.898 --> 00:33.667
<i>Mission file: 2020.</i>

00:33.767 --> 00:36.036
<i>Agent Harry Tasker

00:36.137 --> 00:37.638
<i>to Slovenia to intercept</i>

00:37.738 --> 00:39.607
<i>experimental high-tech explosives.</i>

00:39.707 --> 00:44.478
<i>Code name:
Operation Bomb Swipe.</i>

01:22.750 --> 01:24.252
Gib, gonna need
some help getting out of here.

01:24.352 --> 01:26.120
All right, alarms are going off,

01:26.220 --> 01:27.655
so the main exit is out.

01:27.755 --> 01:31.359
Uh, there's an open door
up ahead on your right, Harry.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.361
Yeah, Gib,
that door on the right?

01:33.461 --> 01:35.028
It just closed.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.798
Okay.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.500
Looks like we're
in a complete security lockdown.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.734
This is not good.

01:43.671 --> 01:46.374
I got the AI hacking
into the security systems.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.975
Sit tight.
"Sit tight"?

01:48.075 --> 01:50.944
Gib, listen to me, I am not
missing Helen's birthday.

01:51.044 --> 01:53.381
You think I want you
to miss her birthday?

01:53.481 --> 01:54.848
Do you understand
how much time

01:54.948 --> 01:56.750
I spent buying the gift
you're giving her?

01:56.850 --> 01:58.986
When is our dinner reservation?

01:59.086 --> 02:00.821
Uh, it was 7:00 p.m.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.323
at Chez Monsieur.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.058
Ooh, and I hear the cassoulet
is out of this world.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.860
It's a shame
Helen's gonna miss it.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.829
No, it's not a shame.
Helen is not gonna miss

02:08.929 --> 02:11.565
their cassoulet,
whatever that is.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.667
You need to talk to the
computer system, man.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.170
Have you tried to hack
a Slovenian military base?

02:16.270 --> 02:18.138
I can't even read this.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.810
Hey, Gib?

02:22.910 --> 02:25.179
Omega doesn't need all four
of the explosives, do they?

02:25.279 --> 02:27.915
Harry, don't do that.
The hallway's too small.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.850
We can get you out of here
without you blowing things up.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.720
Gib, sometimes
you got to blow stuff up.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.489
Don't, don't do that.

02:36.524 --> 02:40.027
Gib, it's Helen's birthday,
and I am not gonna miss it.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.468
Happy birthday, honey.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.403
Thanks, Harry.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.805
I can't believe
you got a reservation.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.407
You know this place is fancy

02:53.507 --> 02:55.676
because the portions are
so small.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.512
Well, it does cost the same
as a mortgage payment.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.914
But you're worth
every penny.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.016
Harry, is that blood
on your shirt?

03:03.116 --> 03:04.685
Oh, uh... Yeah.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.855
I was unpacking a computer
and the...

03:07.955 --> 03:10.123
box cutter went rogue. I'm fine.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.225
Madame?

03:11.325 --> 03:13.126
For you.
Thank you.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.095
A little gift
I got you.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.464
Thank you, honey.

03:16.564 --> 03:17.998
Can I open it?
Mm-hmm.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.199
Okay.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.004
Oh, Harry.

03:24.104 --> 03:27.241
It's perfect.

03:28.509 --> 03:31.211
Thank you, baby.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.491
Yeah.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.596
You sure you don't
need any help?

03:48.696 --> 03:50.698
No, I am fine.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.900
I think the kitchen
would say otherwise.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.469
Muffin, I have everything...

03:55.569 --> 03:57.605
under control.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.074
Ah!

04:01.174 --> 04:02.776
See? Perfect timing.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.244
Kids, dinner's ready!

04:04.345 --> 04:06.547
Finally! I am starving.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.951
Oh!

04:11.051 --> 04:13.521
Wow.

04:14.988 --> 04:15.823
Yes.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.925
What's wrong
with the meat?

04:18.025 --> 04:19.360
Nothing.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.295
It's just breathing.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.799
Dad, is it breathing
or is it bleeding?

04:25.899 --> 04:27.768
The recipe said
30 minutes.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.137
It's 30 minutes...

04:30.237 --> 04:31.672
per pound, Harry.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.607
No problem, no problem.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.576
It's a six-pound roast,
so that's, uh...

04:35.676 --> 04:37.578
Two and a half more hours?

04:37.678 --> 04:41.515
Yes, eat some peas,
no problem.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.083
Put this back.

04:43.183 --> 04:44.518
And while we wait,

04:44.618 --> 04:46.854
I can tell your mom about

04:46.954 --> 04:49.923
a romantic getaway
that I planned

04:50.023 --> 04:51.925
for us in Charleston.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.261
You and your brother are
gonna go to Lolo and Lola's

04:54.362 --> 04:55.663
tomorrow and we...

04:55.763 --> 04:58.366
will be staying
at a luxurious villa.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.801
And not only that.
Hmm?

05:03.671 --> 05:06.540
Oh, you also got me a present?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.175
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.577
Can I open it now?
Yes.

05:24.592 --> 05:25.726
What?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.194
You don't like it?

05:27.294 --> 05:28.529
Dad.

05:28.629 --> 05:31.599
She's wearing
the same necklace right now.

05:33.266 --> 05:36.704
You got this for me
for my birthday three years ago.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.640
Yeah. Yeah.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.275
I know that.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.214
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.349
Here's what I think happened,
if I use

05:49.450 --> 05:51.685
my Omega-trained spy
critical thinking skills.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.821
You forgot to make
a reservation,

05:53.921 --> 05:55.789
so you couldn't
get us in anywhere.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.526
So you decided to make
roast because you...

05:58.626 --> 06:00.394
like roast, and...

06:00.494 --> 06:03.363
we all narrowly escaped
death from <i>E. coli.</i>

06:03.464 --> 06:05.132
I made mashed potatoes.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.300
And this luxury villa--
might that be

06:07.401 --> 06:09.770
the leaky time-share
that Luther is always trying

06:09.870 --> 06:11.304
to pawn off on us?

06:11.405 --> 06:13.807
I will pack the extra towels.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.777
I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.146
I just got used to Gib
managing all this stuff.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.014
You don't think I
figured that out?

06:21.114 --> 06:22.416
And by "manage everything,"

06:22.516 --> 06:24.818
do you mean "do everything"?

06:24.918 --> 06:26.787
Because two days
after our anniversary,

06:26.887 --> 06:28.889
you got me
lilac-scented perfume.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.591
I didn't know you were allergic!

06:30.691 --> 06:31.759
Could've died.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.260
I know, I know.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.362
You like the stuff
that Gib gets you better.

06:35.463 --> 06:36.597
I get it.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.566
It's not about what Gib got.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.234
It's not about the Gib gifts.
It's not about the stuff, Harry.

06:41.334 --> 06:44.304
I'm even over the fact
that you lied to me

06:44.404 --> 06:46.974
for 17 years.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.943
All of those memories

06:50.043 --> 06:52.446
of the birthdays,
the anniversary--

06:52.546 --> 06:54.114
they meant
something to me.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.683
I thought that,
behind every single

06:55.783 --> 06:57.217
one of those
special moments,

06:57.317 --> 06:59.286
was a husband who cared,

06:59.386 --> 07:01.455
not Gib with a database

07:01.555 --> 07:03.557
of "things Helen likes...

07:03.657 --> 07:05.859
and isn't allergic to."

07:05.959 --> 07:08.962
Honey, I do care.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.500
I love you,
my heart's in the right place.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.102
I just got used to delegating
all this stuff to Gib

07:15.202 --> 07:16.904
'cause he's really good at it.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.572
And you really liked it.
You were happy.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.508
Delegating love?

07:20.608 --> 07:23.243
Come on, Harry.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.445
It matters whether
or not it's you.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.147
You can dress up a lie,

07:27.247 --> 07:29.149
but it's still
just a lie.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.718
Honey, I...

07:45.666 --> 07:47.267
Hey, shake a leg, guys!

07:47.367 --> 07:49.970
We got a new mission on deck.
Seems like a hedge fund

07:50.070 --> 07:52.005
out of Berlin is up
to some pretty shady stuff.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.107
And we got to stop it.

07:54.207 --> 07:57.044
Eyes on center screen.
Listen up.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.816
Omega Sector analysis believes

08:02.916 --> 08:04.184
that Berlin-based hedge fund

08:04.284 --> 08:06.754
Ocularis Ventures may be
responsible for a series

08:06.854 --> 08:09.389
of recent disasters that have
claimed hundreds of lives.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.526
The Shido Industries
plane crash in Japan.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.495
The Bona Pharmaceuticals fire
in Brazil.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.699
Others are suspected
and currently under analysis.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.701
Ocularis has made almost

08:20.801 --> 08:25.005
$200 million on investments
affected by these incidents.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.740
Omega algorithms calculate

08:26.840 --> 08:29.076
a one-in-over-five-trillion
chance

08:29.176 --> 08:31.411
that this is pure coincidence.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.548
That's... many trillions.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.917
So we think
they're causing the accidents?

08:37.017 --> 08:40.020
Uh, specifically, we think
that it's this guy.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.355
Ocularis CEO Reed Kessler.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.125
Ex-CIA.
Counterterror division.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.860
He'd know how
to bring down a plane.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.495
We think he's gonna do it again?

08:48.596 --> 08:51.198
Yeah, and this is
gonna be the worst yet.

08:51.298 --> 08:54.167
Ocularis just made an investment
that pays off big

08:54.267 --> 08:56.503
if the cruise ship industry
tanks, so we think

08:56.604 --> 08:59.239
they're gonna hit a ship,
but we've got no proof.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.041
We've had no luck with hacks,

09:01.141 --> 09:03.811
so we're going after
an inside source.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.914
Which leads me to Lisa Hardy.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.248
Aw, she looks nice.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.051
Well, she's the senior
vice president of giving

09:11.151 --> 09:13.453
and charity projects
over at Ocularis.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.422
That CEO Reed Kessler?

09:15.522 --> 09:16.890
She's his girlfriend.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.859
You're gonna approach
her as a journalist.

09:18.959 --> 09:22.229
Get in and then get a full
data dump from their computers.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.865
Helen, you're
on intel.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.433
All right?

09:26.533 --> 09:28.401
You need to figure out which
levers you can pull to flip her.

09:28.501 --> 09:31.338
Don't worry, the psych guys
have a ton of research for you.

09:31.438 --> 09:34.307
Maria, Luther, you two
head over to engineering.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.909
All right, guys,
let's get after it.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.646
Wheels up at 0600 tomorrow.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.648
Hey.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.850
Ooh-ooh,
look at her, look at her.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.451
Hey, I just want
to let you know

09:44.551 --> 09:46.353
we're pushing off
on the mission soon.
Mm-hmm.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.789
But I will be thinking
about you the whole time.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.892
Well, leave a little room
in your head for the mission.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.526
But...

09:53.627 --> 09:55.829
it is nice to know
I'm on your mind.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.165
Always.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.301
Hey, Gib?
Huh?

10:01.401 --> 10:02.369
Walk slower.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.337
Okay.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.674
Thank you.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.643
So, we've been working
on some improvements

10:09.743 --> 10:11.011
to the laser cutter.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.680
You'll be our first field test.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.547
Ooh, first.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.849
Ooh, exciting.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.118
So, it looks
pretty much the same.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.920
Yes, but we've added stuff.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.389
Like this safety lock.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.925
Don't want anyone cutting off
anything important.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.263
Yes, that's...

10:30.363 --> 10:31.765
useful.

10:31.865 --> 10:35.468
And it's now adjustable
so it can cut larger things.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.539
Love it.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.243
And if you adjust

10:43.343 --> 10:45.178
the color of the laser,

10:45.278 --> 10:48.148
it can cut other things
like glass.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.519
That... is amazing.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.088
Yep.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.858
You know, just normal

10:57.958 --> 10:59.226
upgrade stuff.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.562
Anyhoo, I should

11:02.662 --> 11:04.698
go... do...

11:04.798 --> 11:07.134
things. Good luck!

11:11.338 --> 11:12.672
Huh.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.775
Did she seem...

11:14.875 --> 11:16.810
kind of... nervous?

11:16.910 --> 11:18.846
Nervous? Nah.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.681
No, no, I think that's just her.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.852
Is that the cologne that I gave
you when we were going out?

11:24.952 --> 11:26.519
Maybe? Yeah.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.188
I guess it is.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.005
All right, Harry, you ready?

11:45.105 --> 11:46.539
In place. Great.

11:46.639 --> 11:49.109
I hacked Lisa's phone
and got us her schedule.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.278
She's meeting Reed
in ten minutes.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.013
She'll be coming from the south.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.681
You'll intercept.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.884
Which means you don't have a lot
of time to make contact, okay?

11:56.984 --> 11:58.385
Luther, Maria?

11:58.485 --> 12:00.253
Reed's coming from the west.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.688
You guys see Reed,
you do whatever

12:01.789 --> 12:02.990
it takes to hold him up.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.092
Harry's got to have time
to do his thing.

12:05.192 --> 12:08.128
<i>Ja,</i> we are all set.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.999
You sure do like
that thing.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.700
Yeah.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.368
It's, um...

12:15.468 --> 12:16.636
it's cute.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.806
"Cute."

12:18.906 --> 12:21.008
Interesting choice
of words.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.910
What's interesting
about it?

12:23.010 --> 12:24.711
I don't know.

12:24.812 --> 12:27.848
It's just... interesting.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.118
Hey, Helen, good job
getting through all your intel.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.720
You really did your homework.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.088
It feels icky

12:35.188 --> 12:36.990
manipulating a woman
with all of her love

12:37.090 --> 12:39.226
for cats and "save the children"
websites.

12:39.326 --> 12:42.129
I don't know that I get
the ick factor.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.831
Yeah, you wouldn't.

12:43.931 --> 12:47.334
'Cause for 17 years,
you helped Harry manipulate me.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.203
Oh, "manipulate"?

12:50.303 --> 12:53.106
Oh, come on, Helen,
stop that.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.175
Harry's just not good
at that kind of stuff.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.344
And, besides,
if he has a system

12:57.444 --> 12:59.346
in place
to seem considerate,

12:59.446 --> 13:02.582
isn't that kind of
being considerate, hmm?

13:02.682 --> 13:03.917
Mm...

13:04.017 --> 13:05.252
Agree to disagree.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.820
All right, check this out.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.421
Eva...

13:08.521 --> 13:10.057
sometimes worries
that I'm too focused

13:10.157 --> 13:12.359
on work to be
in a relationship, right?

13:12.459 --> 13:14.761
So what I did
was create an AI

13:14.862 --> 13:16.563
that sends her texts

13:16.663 --> 13:18.731
so she's always
feeling the love.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.137
Is that really solving
the problem, though?

13:24.237 --> 13:25.605
Hey, guys, Lisa's incoming.

13:25.705 --> 13:26.907
Uh-oh.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.876
Luther, Maria,
it looks like Reed

13:28.976 --> 13:30.343
is early to the lunch.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.145
Gonna need you guys
to hold him off.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.048
We're on it.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.918
Is that Reed
coming up the tunnel?

13:38.018 --> 13:40.220
We're gonna have
to blow our cover.
Maybe not.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.022
I got an idea.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.024
You're still playing
with that thing?
I'm not playing.

13:44.124 --> 13:47.160
Just follow my lead.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.349
Okay, you got a few minutes.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.584
Excellent. Reed's got
to go around the block.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.020
Harry, hurry up.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.554
Ready to intercept.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.599
All right, Harry's in place.
Engaging with the target.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.101
Uh, excuse me.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.037
You speak English?
Mm-hmm.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.471
Oh, great. Mind if I sit there?

14:31.571 --> 14:32.739
Yeah, go ahead.
Thank you.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.346
You think Harry's gonna
do a good job at this?

14:39.446 --> 14:41.581
It's not like he spends a lot
of time talking to random women.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.551
Wait, does he?

14:44.651 --> 14:47.921
Hmm?
No. No.

14:48.021 --> 14:51.158
He sometimes has to speak
to women for his job.

14:51.258 --> 14:54.928
But he's a trained spy and
a professional, he'll be fine.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.032
So you're American?

14:59.132 --> 15:00.567
Yes.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.169
And so is
my boyfriend.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.137
Oh, don't worry,
I'm not hitting on you.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.373
I'm married.
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.675
I haven't hit on a girl
since Kelly Metcalf

15:08.775 --> 15:10.443
socked me in the nose
in second grade.

15:10.543 --> 15:11.811
Ah, ouch.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.346
What? Something wrong?

15:13.446 --> 15:15.482
Yeah, something's wrong,
that's the line he used on me

15:15.582 --> 15:16.984
when we met.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.719
Easy, easy, it's just
for the job, Helen, relax.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.454
You know, I should tell you

15:21.554 --> 15:23.590
it's actually not a coincidence
we're both American.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.158
Or that I'm sitting here.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.327
What?
I'm a journalist.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.429
Michael Stone.
I was wondering

15:29.529 --> 15:31.664
if I could ask you a few
questions about your company.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.067
I'm really sorry,
but Ocularis has

15:34.167 --> 15:35.935
strict policies
against reporters.
I get it,

15:36.036 --> 15:38.738
but it would only be...
Helen, you need
to help him out here.

15:38.838 --> 15:40.607
Harry, it's your wife here.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.742
She's a big fan

15:42.842 --> 15:45.145
of the human rights podcast
<i>To Save a Life.</i>

15:45.245 --> 15:47.880
The tagline is,
"Think what you would do."

15:47.981 --> 15:49.849
So I should
really be going.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.985
Please. I'm sure
you're very busy.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.921
Just think, what would
you do to save a life?

15:55.022 --> 15:56.323
<i>To Save a Life.</i>

15:56.423 --> 15:57.991
It's my favorite podcast.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.426
It's great. Right?
Amazing.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.229
Hey, nice job.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.797
It still feels icky.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.200
Okay, I should really go,
but just tell me,

16:07.300 --> 16:09.036
what is
your Ocularis story about?

16:09.136 --> 16:10.670
You're aware they've
made a lot of money

16:10.770 --> 16:13.140
off disasters where
people have died?
Yes.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.075
But the CEO
Reed Kessler,

16:15.175 --> 16:17.610
I mean, his whole strategy is
based on identifying industries

16:17.710 --> 16:19.979
that are vulnerable
to accidents.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.549
What if, God forbid,

16:22.649 --> 16:24.717
they weren't accidents?

16:24.817 --> 16:26.353
Reed may not even
know. You could be

16:26.453 --> 16:28.555
saving him from a scandal.
Helen, help him out.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.722
We need some ammo here.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.659
Uh, Harry,
she loves Ragdoll cats.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.327
Sending you a Ragdoll cat now.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.829
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:36.929 --> 16:37.864
It's my cat sitter. Yeah.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.432
Yeah.

16:40.933 --> 16:41.901
You have a Ragdoll?

16:42.001 --> 16:42.935
Mm-hmm.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.937
Wow, so do I.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.839
Her name's... Muffin.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.708
Muffin.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.143
Can you
believe it?

16:50.243 --> 16:52.112
That's what he calls me.
That's my name.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.147
Okay, okay.
Probably not the ideal choice.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.014
No.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.283
Lisa, this is gonna be

16:56.383 --> 16:57.684
totally off the
record, on background.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.987
I just need to take a look
at Ocularis's files.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.122
Harry. Harry, we got

17:02.222 --> 17:03.890
Reed incoming. 30 seconds.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.093
I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.461
But he's not just the CEO--
he's my boyfriend.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.997
I know it feels dishonest,
but if your heart's

17:11.098 --> 17:12.932
in the right place,

17:13.032 --> 17:15.935
isn't that what really
matters to someone you love?

17:16.035 --> 17:19.106
Are you listening to
what I'm listening to?
Helen, it's just for a cover ID.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.673
It's just for the cover ID.
Yeah, okay. He's...

17:20.773 --> 17:21.908
But you just got
to let him work!

17:22.008 --> 17:23.576
Call me.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.446
Please.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.155
<i>Come on.</i>

17:35.255 --> 17:37.257
Honey, I'm trying
to save lives here.

17:37.357 --> 17:40.593
I'm sorry if I used some
unfortunate choices on the op.

17:40.693 --> 17:44.564
Oh, yes, you unfortunately got
all of your icky little spy lies

17:44.664 --> 17:48.201
all over my favorite memories
of when we first met.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.702
Icky spy lies?
Yeah.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.904
Wow, I didn't know you cared
so much about Kelly Metcalf.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.906
I don't.
But I'm starting to see

17:54.006 --> 17:55.308
why she might have socked you.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.544
Harry, this is everything
I've been talking about.

17:57.644 --> 18:00.012
We have this whole history of
things that are special to me.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.349
And then when you take
my nickname and you give it away

18:02.449 --> 18:03.916
to imaginary cats...

18:04.016 --> 18:05.685
"Muffin" is just a word.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.287
No, it's not just a word.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.088
It's special. It's my nickname.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.523
It's between us.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.525
And what did you mean
when you said, "Lying is okay

18:12.625 --> 18:14.661
as long as my heart's
in the right place"?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.996
I didn't say "my heart."
I didn't say "my heart."

18:17.096 --> 18:18.431
I said "hearts," you know?
You said "hearts."

18:18.531 --> 18:20.800
In general.
It's very hard.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.535
And then, on top of it, I'm...

18:22.635 --> 18:26.573
helping you put lies into
someone else's relationship.

18:26.673 --> 18:30.577
Honey, nothing important in
our relationship was a lie.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.412
Those things
were important to <i>me.</i>

18:34.381 --> 18:36.048
Hey.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.686
Did I interrupt
something?

18:39.786 --> 18:42.155
No. No, everything is fine.
Yeah. Yeah, you did, Gib.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.691
Okay. I'm not gonna step
in that one.

18:44.791 --> 18:45.792
Here's the update.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.260
Still no call
from Lisa,

18:47.360 --> 18:49.362
and our stock market
analysts think

18:49.462 --> 18:51.831
Ocularis is gonna hit
a cruise ship within days.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.333
You got to get
into their computers

18:53.433 --> 18:55.001
pronto if we want to stop it.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.603
I can't approach
Lisa again so soon.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.138
Precisely. That's why
you're not going to.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.640
We're sending Helen in.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.041
Wait, me?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.976
You got to get Lisa
to call Michael Stone.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.178
So I have to lie

19:05.278 --> 19:06.646
to Lisa about her boyfriend?

19:06.746 --> 19:07.747
I have to lie to her face?

19:07.847 --> 19:09.549
I-- This all feels...

19:09.649 --> 19:11.284
Better than watching
a cruise ship sink

19:11.384 --> 19:12.752

how's it looking out there?

20:02.134 --> 20:04.170
Passing the fifth floor now.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.938
I'm gonna start
cutting our way in.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.074
With Quinn's
cute laser pen?

20:08.174 --> 20:09.742
Do we use that
for everything now?

20:09.842 --> 20:11.844
You saw it cut glass.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.580
And I'm using it to cut glass.

Okay, we are through the window

20:22.955 --> 20:24.391
and in the offices.

20:24.491 --> 20:25.224
Nice work.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.327
Accessing computer.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.632
So, you're
really gonna make me ask?

20:32.732 --> 20:33.933
Ask what?

20:34.033 --> 20:35.234
Whether you're dating Quinn.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.869
No.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.838
Uh, that-- I'm-I'm not.

20:38.938 --> 20:42.375
It's just weird that you're
calling a laser cutter cute.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.611
You're wearing the cologne
that I gave you.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.513
Those things have nothing
to do with each other.

20:46.613 --> 20:47.980
So let's just
focus on this.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.416
Mm-hmm.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.217
She's in.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.119
Helen, you are
good to go.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.624
Hey, I'm Candace Schaefer.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.225
I'm on the list.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.260
There you go, miss.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.129
<i>And we who have been fortunate</i>

21:03.229 --> 21:05.765
have an obligation to give back.

21:05.865 --> 21:09.536
That's why the Ocularis
Foundation supports EarthOne.

21:09.636 --> 21:13.039
Because we truly are one Earth.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.707
Thank you.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.385
Hey, Helen.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.986
Any luck approaching Lisa?

21:27.086 --> 21:29.322
No. She's still stuck with Reed.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.691
He won't leave her alone.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.595
You looked so beautiful
up there tonight.

21:35.695 --> 21:37.730
Thank you.

21:39.932 --> 21:40.867
Something wrong?

21:40.967 --> 21:42.402
No.

21:42.502 --> 21:45.338
I'm just thinking about
where the money came from.

21:45.438 --> 21:49.275
It feels so wrong to be
profiting off misery.

21:49.376 --> 21:52.379
Bad things happen
all the time.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.646
It's not like
we're responsible

21:53.746 --> 21:56.315
for those disasters.
Mm-hmm.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.685
And look around--
we're doing good things.
I know.

21:58.785 --> 22:01.554
I just don't want this to be the
pretty face for something ugly.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.524
You're too good for me.

22:08.495 --> 22:09.996
Reed's leaving.

22:10.096 --> 22:11.330
Helen, you're up. Go.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.866
I don't know if I can do this.

22:15.435 --> 22:17.103
Helen,

22:17.203 --> 22:18.838
just think of it like this--

22:18.938 --> 22:20.407
Reed is the one lying to her.

22:20.507 --> 22:23.109
You're just, you know,
the one setting her straight.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.878
You know what, Harry,
that actually...

22:25.978 --> 22:27.514
makes some sense.

22:31.751 --> 22:32.719
Hi.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.186
I'm so sorry
to interrupt. No.

22:34.286 --> 22:35.321
I really loved your speech.

22:35.422 --> 22:36.322
Oh, thank you.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.124
And I don't mean
to pry.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.659
Sometimes I pick up
on things,

22:39.759 --> 22:41.193
but are you all right?

22:41.293 --> 22:43.062
You looked down
up there. Oh.

22:43.162 --> 22:45.632
No, yeah. Of
course. It's j...

22:45.732 --> 22:47.934
You know, it's just
relationship stuff.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.969
That's all.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.604
Ah, men.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.873
The worst. Am I right?
Ugh. Yeah.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.642
Was that
directed at me?

22:57.544 --> 22:58.511
That was
directed at me.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.112
What is it with you
and Helen?

23:00.212 --> 23:01.414
It's an op, Harry.

23:01.514 --> 23:02.882
I mean, Reed is great.
Mm-hmm.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.251
Believe me, whatever it is
you are gonna say,

23:05.351 --> 23:08.254
I've had it way worse. Embarrassing.

23:08.354 --> 23:10.322
It's just, sometimes
he'll say things to me

23:10.423 --> 23:12.124
like "You're
too good for me."

23:12.224 --> 23:14.060
Yeah, that language

23:14.160 --> 23:16.729
might make you think
that he's...

23:16.829 --> 23:18.498
hiding something bad.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.968
And so what do I do
if I feel like I don't really...

23:22.068 --> 23:23.503
know him?

23:23.603 --> 23:26.138
Well, unfortunately, you are
talking to the perfect person.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.674
I mean,
a couple months ago,

23:27.774 --> 23:31.644
I thought my husband was leading
a totally different life.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.813
You know?
But I didn't know...

23:33.913 --> 23:35.715
Is he having an affair?

23:35.815 --> 23:37.116
Is he a spy?

23:37.216 --> 23:38.651
I didn't know.

23:38.751 --> 23:39.786
Sure.
I didn't know!

23:39.886 --> 23:41.220
Oh, come on.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.789
Hey, man, you're the one
who told her to tell the truth.

23:42.889 --> 23:44.290
Ha-ha.

23:44.390 --> 23:45.424
What did you do?

23:45.525 --> 23:46.693
I confronted him.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.695
But, of course,
he denied everything.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.062
Wow.

23:50.162 --> 23:51.831
And then?
Well, I needed
to get to the bottom

23:51.931 --> 23:53.332
of it. Was I married

23:53.432 --> 23:56.168
to someone who was
manipulating me?

23:57.537 --> 23:59.539
Can you
believe that?

23:59.639 --> 24:01.508
What did you find out?
I did

24:01.608 --> 24:03.810
some snooping. I did lots of
snooping. I'm a wonderful snoop.

24:03.910 --> 24:08.247
And I found out that I was
actually just really paranoid.

24:08.347 --> 24:11.651
My husband
was totally sincere

24:11.751 --> 24:14.787
and completely trustworthy.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.389
What? She's saying
nice things.

24:17.490 --> 24:18.758
Yeah, she's saying
very nice mean things.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.392
Mean things.
The point is,

24:20.493 --> 24:22.461
I'm actually glad that I did
all of that digging

24:22.562 --> 24:24.897
because it put
all of my fears

24:24.997 --> 24:26.365
to rest.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.567
He got me this necklace
for my birthday.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.669
Oh, wow! Yeah.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.003
I almost want
two of 'em.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.507
Anyway, good luck.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.208
I'm sorry
to have taken your time.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.545
Thanks for all
the lovely things that you do.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.947
Great work, Helen.
Really, good job.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.415
No, don't say
"Great work, Helen.

24:43.516 --> 24:46.285
Really good job."
Say "Mean work, Helen.

24:46.385 --> 24:49.556
Unnecessarily cruel job."

24:52.859 --> 24:55.161
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Harry.

24:55.261 --> 24:56.896
Is that Lisa?
Yeah.

24:58.665 --> 24:59.899
This is Michael Stone.

24:59.999 --> 25:00.867
Hi.

25:00.967 --> 25:03.970
This is Lisa from... today.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.472
I think we should meet.

25:07.373 --> 25:09.008
I'm so glad you called.

25:16.282 --> 25:17.550
I just wanted
to check in on you guys

25:17.650 --> 25:18.751
and see how you're doing
at Lolo and Lola's.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.052
Well, Lolo

25:20.152 --> 25:22.121
is making us watch
grandpa TV shows.

25:22.221 --> 25:23.790
We've seen, like, seven programs

25:23.890 --> 25:25.625
on the Philippines
in World War II.

25:25.725 --> 25:29.095
The Battle of Bataan would grind
on for another four months

25:29.195 --> 25:31.564
while soldiers dug in
for a difficult winter.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.766
Anyway, how's your luxury villa?

25:33.866 --> 25:35.702
Are you and Dad romancing?

25:35.802 --> 25:37.637
Uh, yeah. Lots of...

25:37.737 --> 25:39.538
romancing.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.273
We should go,
though, okay?

25:41.373 --> 25:43.810
Uh, have fun learning about the
Bataan Death March, you guys.

25:43.910 --> 25:44.977
Kisses.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.312
Hey, we need
to get going.

25:46.412 --> 25:47.914
My meeting with Lisa
is in a half hour.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.448
Don't you think
we should talk a little bit?

25:49.548 --> 25:50.516
You seem a little miffed.

25:50.617 --> 25:52.184
Honestly?
Yeah, Helen.

25:52.284 --> 25:53.452
I am a little miffed.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.754
It was an op, Harry.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.589
Did you have to
bring up the locket?

25:56.689 --> 25:58.457
How do you expect me to feel?

25:58.557 --> 26:01.160
It was so special when
you gave me the first locket.

26:01.260 --> 26:02.729
It felt so thoughtful
and perfect,

26:02.829 --> 26:05.497
and then I find out you don't
even remember giving it to me?

26:05.598 --> 26:07.166
Okay, I get it.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.602
Did that lie mess up a
beautiful memory for you?

26:09.702 --> 26:10.903
Yes, it did.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.172
But there was truth
under that lie.

26:13.272 --> 26:14.974
What are you talking about?

26:15.074 --> 26:17.610
Do you know why
I didn't remember?

26:17.710 --> 26:18.544
No.

26:18.645 --> 26:19.879
Blood loss.

26:19.979 --> 26:20.880
I was dizzy.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.014
What?

26:22.114 --> 26:23.149
Remember when I had blood

26:23.249 --> 26:24.483
on my shirt that night?

26:26.252 --> 26:27.687
I was on a mission,
and I blew a door up

26:27.787 --> 26:29.488
because I didn't want to
be late for your birthday.

26:30.790 --> 26:33.760
<i>The explosion blew a nail
through my tactical vest.</i>

26:33.860 --> 26:35.027
<i>So, yeah, I didn't remember.</i>

26:35.127 --> 26:36.462
Because I lost
two pints of blood.

26:36.562 --> 26:39.165
Because I love you!

26:39.265 --> 26:41.868
Okay, well,
I appreciate that, but...

26:41.968 --> 26:43.535
how was I supposed
to know?

26:43.636 --> 26:45.071
Check your blood pressure?

27:27.579 --> 27:28.781
Would you, though?

Why would it be weird?

Lisa, thank you so much
for meeting me.

28:13.726 --> 28:16.328
Yeah, I, uh, wasn't sure
I was going to at first.

28:16.428 --> 28:17.696
Well, you made
the right decision.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.899
I just want you to
take a look at the files,

28:19.999 --> 28:21.734
make sure that
everything's legit.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.602
I mean, I-I love Reed.

I just want to make sure
that I really know him,

28:25.738 --> 28:26.705
you know?

28:26.806 --> 28:28.240
Yeah. Yeah, I think I might.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.142
Okay.

28:32.611 --> 28:34.013
Is your AI robot

28:34.113 --> 28:35.347
keeping your
girlfriend happy?

28:35.447 --> 28:37.716
Uh, my relationship
management tool

28:37.817 --> 28:40.252
is letting my girlfriend know
that I care about her, yes.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.988
And it's working
just fine.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.690
Okay.

28:45.792 --> 28:46.859
Oh.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.360
Okay, Harry,

28:48.460 --> 28:49.395
you got to get
in that computer

28:49.495 --> 28:50.429
and do
a full data dump.

28:50.529 --> 28:51.831
We need to know everything

28:51.931 --> 28:53.365
they've done and everything
they're planning.

28:56.836 --> 28:57.970
All right.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.072
So, this is his
private server.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.707
Uh, it's not
connected to the outside,

29:01.808 --> 29:04.510
and a lot of it is encrypted.
I can only access parts.

29:04.610 --> 29:06.712
That's all right,
I can get the rest.

29:07.613 --> 29:09.615
Uh, what are you doing?

29:09.715 --> 29:11.617
I need complete research.

29:11.717 --> 29:12.985
Wait, you didn't

29:13.085 --> 29:15.587
tell me you need
all the files. Why?

29:18.324 --> 29:19.959
It's Reed calling.
What do I do?

29:20.059 --> 29:21.794
Lisa, it's okay.
Just stay calm,

29:21.894 --> 29:23.095
act normal.

29:23.195 --> 29:24.463
Okay? This is important. Yeah.

29:24.563 --> 29:25.932
Put it on speaker. Okay.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.869
Hi, honey.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.138
Hey, where are you?

29:32.238 --> 29:35.174
Oh, I'm just out doing errands.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.476
You sure about that?

29:37.576 --> 29:39.045
Because after your questions
about Ocularis last night,

29:39.145 --> 29:41.613
I was concerned,
so I put together

29:41.713 --> 29:42.882
a little security detail

29:42.982 --> 29:45.017
and followed you. Lisa...

29:45.117 --> 29:47.286
I know where you are.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.055
Stop what you're
doing right now...

29:49.155 --> 29:50.189
Gib, you hear that?

29:50.289 --> 29:51.690
We got problems.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.092
What? Who's...

29:53.192 --> 29:54.726
Who are you talking to?
Who's Gib?
There's no time.

29:54.827 --> 29:57.830
Seriously, who's Gib?
What's going on?

29:57.930 --> 29:59.565
Come on.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.404
I don't like this.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.742
Luther, Maria,
I got armed guards.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.478
There's three of them
coming up the west stairwell,

30:12.578 --> 30:14.680
<i>heading your way.
You need to move.</i>

30:14.780 --> 30:16.182
"Move?" Is that it?

30:16.282 --> 30:17.583
Any other suggestions?

30:17.683 --> 30:19.418
Just get out of there.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.424
Who are you?
Where are we going?

30:25.524 --> 30:27.359
I work for a U.S.
government agency.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.361
You're not
safe here.
You're a spy?

30:29.461 --> 30:30.596
You lied to me?

30:30.696 --> 30:32.298
Oh, come on, a lot
of people lied to you.

30:33.732 --> 30:34.901
Stop!

30:36.936 --> 30:38.304
Gib...

30:38.404 --> 30:39.838
we're coming out, east side.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.240
We'll be ready.

30:44.143 --> 30:45.244
Where are
we going?

30:45.344 --> 30:46.745
The ambulance. Come on.

30:50.883 --> 30:53.752
Go, go, go!

31:05.797 --> 31:06.865
You.

31:06.966 --> 31:07.900
From last night.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.001
You're a part of this?

31:09.101 --> 31:10.469
Yeah, it's a funny story,

31:10.569 --> 31:11.637
and you're gonna laugh.

31:11.737 --> 31:12.771
I thought you were helping me,

31:12.871 --> 31:14.106
but you're both spies?

31:15.908 --> 31:17.043
You monsters!
No...

31:17.143 --> 31:19.278
Harry, got an SUV coming in hot.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.284
Gib, step on it.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.086
I'm on it.

31:29.288 --> 31:30.556
<i>All the corporate accidents</i>

31:30.656 --> 31:32.024
that Reed
is profiting from,

31:32.124 --> 31:33.926
he is also causing.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.295
No, no, Reed would
never hurt anyone.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.165
He's literally shooting
at us right now.

31:39.265 --> 31:43.002
Whoa, not good.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.237
Get down.

31:46.338 --> 31:47.473
We're sitting
ducks up here.

31:47.573 --> 31:48.907
We've got to get
off this thing.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.287
I'll cover you. Go!

32:18.670 --> 32:20.206
Come on, Gib, you can
drive better than that.

32:20.306 --> 32:22.108
I'm going as fast
as I can, buddy.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.875
<i>It's an ambulance.
Don't they go fast?</i>

32:23.976 --> 32:26.712
Harry, you know
this is a disguise, right?

32:26.812 --> 32:28.614
This thing handles
like a fridge on wheels.

32:28.714 --> 32:29.948
Yeah, could you just let me out?

32:30.049 --> 32:31.217
I actually
don't want to be a part of this.

32:31.317 --> 32:32.985
I understand that
it's really, really hard

32:33.085 --> 32:35.254
to hear the truth, but I promise
you, everything we did,

32:35.354 --> 32:36.588
we did it with a good reason.

32:36.688 --> 32:38.224
There's no good reason to lie.

32:38.324 --> 32:39.591
You want to explain
that one, Helen?

32:39.691 --> 32:41.427
Sometimes there is,

32:41.527 --> 32:44.063
like when people's lives
are at stake.

32:44.163 --> 32:47.033
There, Harry. Happy now?

32:50.869 --> 32:53.305
The air conditioner
thing, go. Go.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.818
Keep them busy.
I've got an idea.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.389
If we can take
those two guys out,

33:10.489 --> 33:11.557
we can go over the side.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.395
Here come more guys.
They're flanking us.

33:19.265 --> 33:20.932
Hey, I can't shake 'em, Harry,

33:21.033 --> 33:23.469
and this ambulance wasn't
built for a shootout.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.276
Stay down, stay down.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.747
We're not gonna last
much longer like this.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.383
I got to get rid of these guys.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.120
What, no, Harry,
what are you doing?

33:41.220 --> 33:42.621
No-no-no-no-no, get down.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.625
I'm making an explosive.

33:46.725 --> 33:47.893
I'm gonna try and blow 'em up.

33:47.993 --> 33:49.161
Who are you, Nolan Ryan?

33:49.261 --> 33:50.462
How you gonna get
close enough to hit 'em?

33:50.562 --> 33:52.164
Well, the windows don't open,

33:52.264 --> 33:53.965
and even if they did,
I wouldn't be able to aim,

33:54.066 --> 33:56.001
so I'm gonna go
out on the gurney.

33:56.102 --> 33:57.969
Harry, that is
literally the worst idea

33:58.070 --> 33:59.471
I have ever heard.

34:01.473 --> 34:02.674
Yeah...

34:02.774 --> 34:03.942
I don't love it either.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.577
<i>Helen, come sit over here.</i>

34:05.677 --> 34:07.479
Lisa, get back there.

34:07.579 --> 34:10.449
Gib, I need you to
hold this thing steady.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.151
<i>How am I supposed to do that?</i>

34:12.251 --> 34:14.019
I'm dodging bullets.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.122
Harry, there has to be
a better way to do this.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.823
Yeah, well, sometimes
you've got to blow stuff up.

34:17.923 --> 34:19.425
Didn't go so well

34:19.525 --> 34:20.692
last time you said that.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.462
Are you serious? You are
going to get yourself killed.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.830
Maybe, but if I don't,

34:24.930 --> 34:26.098
your boyfriend's going to
kill thousands of people,

34:26.198 --> 34:27.966
and I'm not going
to let that happen.

34:33.139 --> 34:35.374
GIB
This ambulance is about
to need an ambulance.

34:35.474 --> 34:38.144
Harry, if you're
gonna do the bomb thing,

34:38.244 --> 34:39.645
now's the time.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.180
Helen, you ready?

34:41.280 --> 34:42.714
<i>No, I'm not ready.</i>

34:42.814 --> 34:43.915
I hate this.

34:44.015 --> 34:44.883
Honey, we don't
have a choice.

34:44.983 --> 34:46.518
Go.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.535
Harry!

35:12.611 --> 35:14.346
I'll hold them off
while you go down.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.714
Who's gonna cover you?

35:15.814 --> 35:17.616
We can't both go. I'll be okay.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.552
What are you talking about?

35:20.652 --> 35:22.120
The minute you run
out of ammo, you're dead.

35:23.689 --> 35:25.324
Either one of us
gets off this roof,

35:25.424 --> 35:26.325
or neither of us does.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.526
Then you go, I'll stay.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.960
If I don't make it,

35:29.060 --> 35:31.330
you'll tell Quinn that
I was thinking about her...

35:31.430 --> 35:33.865
and that I'm grateful for all
the time we had together?

35:34.700 --> 35:36.101
No, I am not bringing

35:36.202 --> 35:38.237
love letters to
your new girlfriend.

35:38.337 --> 35:39.638
Please, Maria.

35:43.074 --> 35:44.710
I'll go left,
you take right.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.512
Wait, this is crazy.

36:00.892 --> 36:02.594
Whatever you have
to say to Quinn,

36:02.694 --> 36:05.564
you can tell her yourself.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.411
You sure you're okay, big guy?

36:19.511 --> 36:20.912
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm all right.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.248
I was
so worried

36:22.348 --> 36:23.282
about you.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.317
Helen, my ribs.
Oh. Yep.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.253
Sorry.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.154
Don't worry, Helen.
Harry's been through worse.

36:29.255 --> 36:32.558
Hey, good news is,
it was worth it.

36:32.658 --> 36:33.759
I already heard
from Omega.

36:33.859 --> 36:34.960
They went
through the data

36:35.060 --> 36:36.295
that we pulled off
of Reed's computer,

36:36.395 --> 36:38.163
and they're currently
pulling 1,500 passengers

36:38.264 --> 36:41.066
off of a cruise ship
with a bomb in its hull.

36:41.166 --> 36:43.835
All in all, I'd call
that a good day's work.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.308
Hey, will you just
tell me one thing?

36:49.408 --> 36:51.477
Was anything

36:51.577 --> 36:53.412
you told me true?

36:53.512 --> 36:55.146
All of it.

36:55.247 --> 36:57.516
And... kind of

36:57.616 --> 36:59.351
none of it.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.360
If I dislocated
my shoulder

37:08.460 --> 37:09.728
jumping from behind
that air conditioner,

37:09.828 --> 37:11.096
you're paying for my PT.

37:11.196 --> 37:12.698
Totally fair.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.733
Oh, one thing.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.001
You really didn't
want to give Quinn

37:16.101 --> 37:17.035
my message, huh?

37:17.135 --> 37:19.137
You thought that
was about Quinn?

37:19.237 --> 37:20.372
Yeah.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.507
You know how
much paperwork

37:21.607 --> 37:22.774
I would have to do
if you died?

37:22.874 --> 37:24.510
That's it? That's
the only reason?

37:24.610 --> 37:26.177
Luther!

37:26.278 --> 37:27.446
Hey.

37:27.546 --> 37:29.247
Thank God you're okay. Yeah.

37:31.983 --> 37:35.287
I mean, thank God
the whole team is okay.

37:35.387 --> 37:37.656
Yeah, it's okay. I know.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.458
Oh, good.

37:39.558 --> 37:42.027
Oh, it was so
hard pretending.

37:44.363 --> 37:45.797
Mmm.

37:50.502 --> 37:52.304
Ah.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.810
Hey. Eva. Hey.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.146
How you doing, babe?

38:01.246 --> 38:02.348
Mmm.

38:02.448 --> 38:03.849
I'm so glad to be home.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.284
I'm glad you made it back safe.

38:06.385 --> 38:09.154
Yeah, got a little hairy
there for a minute,

38:09.254 --> 38:10.922
but...

38:12.023 --> 38:12.758
Hey.

38:14.259 --> 38:15.461
Something wrong?

38:15.561 --> 38:17.463
I read
the mission report.

38:17.563 --> 38:18.530
Mm-hmm.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.865
How were you
able to text me

38:19.965 --> 38:21.933
six times while driving

38:22.033 --> 38:24.002
an ambulance
and dodging gunfire?

38:24.102 --> 38:25.270
What?

38:25.371 --> 38:27.172
Ah, that-that must
have been a mistake.

38:27.272 --> 38:28.540
It's probably
the time zone difference,

38:28.640 --> 38:29.541
something like that.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.910
Gib, I checked.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.680
Exact same time.

38:35.547 --> 38:37.048
See...

38:37.148 --> 38:39.250
I know, this... You're gonna...

38:39.351 --> 38:42.053
Okay, so, I have this
AI program on my phone,

38:42.153 --> 38:44.656
and I kind of
programmed it,

38:44.756 --> 38:46.658
um, to how I feel.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.927
So it sends

38:49.027 --> 38:51.797
the actual, y-y-you
know, the texts.

38:51.897 --> 38:53.999
But that's just
so you know

38:54.099 --> 38:55.634
that I'm thinking
of you, baby. That's all.

38:55.734 --> 38:56.735
That's just so you know.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.970
But you weren't.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.373
Not then.

39:01.473 --> 39:03.542
No, I mean, but
I was thinking about you

39:03.642 --> 39:05.577
when I wrote the program.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.447
Gib, I was so happy

39:08.547 --> 39:09.815
when I got those texts,

39:09.915 --> 39:11.717
and now I find out
it's just a trick.

39:11.817 --> 39:15.454
What? No, it's not...
It's not a trick.

39:15.554 --> 39:17.022
Those texts are real. No...

39:17.122 --> 39:19.525
Th-They're computer-generated,
but it's-it's still...

39:19.625 --> 39:21.860
I'm sorry, Gib.

39:22.928 --> 39:25.363
I want to date a person,

39:25.464 --> 39:27.232
not a computer program.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.335
This isn't going to work.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.611
Harry, what are you doing?

39:39.711 --> 39:41.112
One sec.

39:41.212 --> 39:44.883
I wouldn't be mad if you
brought me a glass of wine.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.685
Well, funny
you should ask.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.954
Oh. Champagne?

39:49.054 --> 39:51.490
What is this?

39:51.590 --> 39:54.292
This is a birthday do-over.

39:55.527 --> 39:56.595
I wanted to
sneak it in

39:56.695 --> 39:57.696
before the kids
got home.

39:57.796 --> 40:00.766
Cheers.
Cheers.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.569
Mmm.
It's delicious.

40:03.669 --> 40:06.772
And that's not all.
There's more.

40:06.872 --> 40:09.407
Happy birthday, Helen.

40:10.676 --> 40:11.710
What is this?

40:11.810 --> 40:13.011
Well, I can tell you
what it's not.

40:13.111 --> 40:15.113
It's definitely
not a heart locket.

40:15.213 --> 40:16.982
Okay, then I like it already.

40:17.949 --> 40:19.384
It's...

40:19.485 --> 40:22.721
What is this?

40:22.821 --> 40:24.022
So, I talked with Omega.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.423
Remember how I told you
about the explosion,

40:25.524 --> 40:27.125
how the nail ripped
through my tactical vest?

40:27.225 --> 40:28.293
Yeah.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.061
Well, they held
on to the nail,

40:30.161 --> 40:31.797
so I had it made
special for you.

40:31.897 --> 40:35.300
That is so sweet, Harry.

40:35.400 --> 40:36.735
And it's from me.

40:36.835 --> 40:38.604
It's not from Gib or an AI.

40:38.704 --> 40:40.572
It came from me.

40:40.672 --> 40:41.773
And an explosive device.

40:43.141 --> 40:44.476
You're so romantic,
Harry Tasker.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.612
You know what's
even more romantic?

40:46.712 --> 40:48.113
What?

40:48.213 --> 40:49.447
I've got a scar to match.

40:50.582 --> 40:52.083
Michael Stone.

40:53.485 --> 40:54.820
Are you okay?

40:54.920 --> 40:57.489
Oh, my stars.

40:58.590 --> 40:59.758
Michael Stone.

40:59.858 --> 41:02.861
These kisses are real.

41:05.330 --> 41:06.364
Right?
