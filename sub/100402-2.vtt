WEBVTT

02:06.042 --> 02:07.001
Nick.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.798
Nick.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.675
Can you hear me?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.388
You're at the Academy.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.849
You're back home again.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.852
Everything's gonna be okay.

02:27.981 --> 02:28.982
Nick.

02:34.654 --> 02:35.530
Lucifer.

02:35.613 --> 02:36.573
Go on.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.993
Call me Daddy.

02:40.076 --> 02:43.413
You're bound in Damascus steel
and circled in salt.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.539
There's no escape.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.499
I wanna talk to Nick.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.429
Sabrina?

03:01.264 --> 03:02.515
Is it really you?

03:06.519 --> 03:07.854
Let me see your tongue.

03:12.942 --> 03:16.738
Nice try, Satan, but a forked tongue
is a dead giveaway.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.740
I wanna talk to the real Nick.

03:18.823 --> 03:19.657
Now.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.087
-Nick.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.759
Nick, I am going to get the Dark Lord
out of you.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.469
I just have to figure out
where to put him.

03:41.930 --> 03:42.805
Hurry, Sabrina.

03:43.514 --> 03:44.349
I can't.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.433
I know.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.063
-Just be strong for me, okay?

04:15.964 --> 04:17.507
Look, Headmistress.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.843
I've made you a little plate
of lovely morning biscuits

04:20.927 --> 04:22.303
to wish you luck on your first day.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.889
Perhaps you'd like to talcum
my derriere too, sister.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.600
Zelda, I know how you get
when you're nervous.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.353
Honestly, do you think us incapable
of handling the education

04:30.436 --> 04:33.022
-of a mere dozen witches and warlocks?
-Sorry, us?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.899
With Ambrose off
trotting around the globe,

04:34.983 --> 04:37.110
I'm going to need you
more than ever, Hilda.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.945
Today, tomorrow, henceforth.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.863
The Spellmans are in this together.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.700
Yeah. So, I'm actually
just gonna go and see Dr. Cee.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.411
Come, come.
Morning assembly begins in 15 minutes,

04:46.494 --> 04:48.830
and we Spellmans don't tolerate tardiness.

04:48.913 --> 04:50.623
-Do we?
-No.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.849
It's a bit early for spell hunting.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.977
Cassius, hi.

05:12.687 --> 05:17.025
You wouldn't happen to have any grimoires
on the subject of soul transference,

05:17.525 --> 05:18.484
would you?

05:19.527 --> 05:23.865
I'm... writing a short story for school

05:23.948 --> 05:27.785
about transferring a soul
from one body to another.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.704
That's arcane magic.

05:29.787 --> 05:34.334
It could take me some time to find.
Where shall I deliver the books when I do?

05:34.417 --> 05:38.254
Oh, no, uh, just hold them here for me.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.758
I, uh, have to go over to my mortal school
for a little while.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.844
I have a really, really important
obligation there.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.799
-Awesome energy, Sabrina.
-Oh, thanks, Lizzie.

07:04.882 --> 07:07.468
With you two on our squad,
we're going to crush the pep rally.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.179
-Well, we're super excited.
-Yeah. Super excited.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.640
Same. Well, catch you later.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.100
-Bye.
-Yes.

07:17.478 --> 07:20.481
I actually am, like, really excited.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.607
Me too.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.109
Like, for real.

07:23.192 --> 07:28.156
I mean, all the insane infernal things
going on right now, with Nick, with Hell.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.283
It's a relief to do something
as normal as--

07:30.366 --> 07:31.409
Hello, girls.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.410
Hey, Ms. Wardwell.

07:35.913 --> 07:36.998
Guess again.

07:38.791 --> 07:39.625
Madam Satan.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.921
Your Highness and I have business
to discuss, but...

07:45.006 --> 07:46.883
I'd rather not do it in such a...

07:48.176 --> 07:49.510
cheerful setting.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.601
<i>Look, if you're here</i>
<i>to take Nick back to Hell,</i>

07:56.684 --> 07:58.895
-you should--
-No, no. I'm here as your regent.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.605
To begin your job training.

08:00.688 --> 08:01.814
Job training?

08:03.107 --> 08:04.609
Doing what, exactly?

08:04.692 --> 08:09.071
Why, the Devil's work, of course.
Your work now. We're starting light.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.157
Today, there are only two souls
to drag to Hell.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.743
What? I have to drag souls to Hell?

08:13.826 --> 08:15.536
No. No way.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.498
I'm not condemning anyone to that place.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.124
They condemn themselves.

08:20.208 --> 08:23.002
You're simply completing transactions
your father began.

08:25.004 --> 08:28.174
Dragging souls is your primary duty
as leader of Hell.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.510
And it's vitally important
that you carry it out,

08:30.593 --> 08:31.594
because the Kings of Hell

08:31.677 --> 08:34.972
and their darkly handsome little prince,
Caliban, are watching you.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.807
And waiting for you to fail.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.560
And if you fail,
you lose our throne to Caliban.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.395
<i>Our</i> throne?

08:43.898 --> 08:44.815
Yes.

08:46.359 --> 08:51.614
Then he'll declare war on this realm
you care so very much for.

08:53.533 --> 08:57.995
Now, see here: name,
expiration date, time, and place.

08:58.412 --> 09:00.498
You'll escort the souls by hand.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.835
And the path to Hell will present itself
to you in an appropriate fashion.

09:04.919 --> 09:05.795
It's all very simple.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.630
Robert Robertson.

09:08.714 --> 09:09.882
What'd this guy do?

09:11.968 --> 09:13.094
It doesn't matter.

09:13.761 --> 09:14.804
He sold his soul.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.014
You're there to collect, not befriend him.

09:18.099 --> 09:21.644
We'll escort you to the first soul,
just to get you out the gate.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.354
What do you mean, we?

09:26.691 --> 09:28.859
He's your muscle,
should the need arise.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.612
Shall we?

09:51.549 --> 09:54.510
For all our searching,
my father's blood led us here?

09:54.594 --> 09:55.886
To Loch Ness?

09:55.970 --> 09:59.015
I'm not surprised Father Blackwood
chose to hide here.

09:59.098 --> 10:02.810
Loch Ness lies atop a powerful rift
along the Earth's ley lines.

10:02.893 --> 10:07.189
Aleister Crowley himself once harnessed
its energies for his own higher magicks.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.568
A magick that could warp
the very fabric of time and space.

10:10.651 --> 10:14.822
-We should keep our wits about us.
-I want blood, Ambrose.

10:16.991 --> 10:20.077
And you shall have it, I promise you.

10:20.786 --> 10:21.787
Soon.

10:26.876 --> 10:27.793
Soon.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.053
Many years ago, my late brother, Edward,

10:37.136 --> 10:39.764
stood on this very spot
and told his students

10:39.847 --> 10:41.307
that with hard work and dedication,

10:41.390 --> 10:43.851
there was no limit
to what they might achieve.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.898
Today, I stand before you as Directrix
with a message of equal hope.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.652
We may be depleted, but we are here.

10:52.735 --> 10:55.071
And together, we shall prevail.

10:57.073 --> 10:57.907
And now...

10:59.450 --> 11:00.493
let us pray.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.706
Hail Lilith, full of disgrace.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.500
The darkness is with thee.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.293
Cursed are you amongst women,

11:09.377 --> 11:12.129
and cursed is the fruit
of thy womb, demons.

11:12.213 --> 11:17.843
Unholy Lilith, mother of night,
pray for our sins now, and...

11:21.013 --> 11:23.015
Unholy Lilith...

11:24.767 --> 11:26.143
mother of night.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.241
They dare abandon me.

12:00.469 --> 12:01.595
Go.

12:02.054 --> 12:05.433
Remind them who their god is.

12:15.818 --> 12:16.944
Excuse me?

12:19.530 --> 12:20.948
Are you Robert Robertson?

12:21.449 --> 12:22.491
I am.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.787
You're not who I expected.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.249
I imagine you're here for the same reason.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.128
Won't you indulge an old man?

12:37.882 --> 12:40.176
I'm afraid I'm not very good at chess.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.680
Well, that's all right.
We're close to the end now.

12:48.726 --> 12:49.852
Can I ask?

12:51.270 --> 12:53.606
What could have been worth
the price of your soul?

13:00.738 --> 13:02.239
My heart's desire.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.243
To be the greatest chess master
in the world.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.454
And I was.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.623
For a time.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.127
Your move.

13:28.015 --> 13:28.974
That's it.

13:30.601 --> 13:31.477
Checkmate.

13:33.395 --> 13:34.396
Game over.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.047
Tell me,
is Hell really as bad as they say?

14:02.591 --> 14:05.761
It's... not so bad.

14:14.061 --> 14:15.563
This isn't right.

14:15.646 --> 14:16.730
Mr. Robertson.

14:18.649 --> 14:19.525
Wait.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.653
Not that one.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.030
Take the other one.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.824
Are you sure?

14:27.491 --> 14:28.534
Definitely.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.336
Aren't you coming with me?

14:41.088 --> 14:42.047
No.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.510
I don't think I'd be welcomed
where you're headed.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.597
But safe travels.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.696
You really are the worst.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.159
Shame!

15:10.242 --> 15:12.202
Heresy! Heresy!

15:12.286 --> 15:13.746
You let him go?

15:13.829 --> 15:15.706
-Explain yourself, witch.
-Well, I--

15:15.789 --> 15:18.792
My kings, my kings,
I am not surprised you're angered.

15:18.876 --> 15:23.297
But may I say as regent, that this was
but a silly momentary lapse in judgment.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.592
-No, that's not true. I--
-The Queen is still learning,

15:26.675 --> 15:30.262
but she guarantees
that the next soul she collects

15:30.346 --> 15:33.766
will burn twice as hot
to rekindle the flames of Hell.

15:33.849 --> 15:36.143
I would like the Morningstar
to speak for herself

15:36.602 --> 15:38.604
and explain why she reprieved the mortal.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.148
If she pleases.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.232
Um...

15:43.025 --> 15:45.277
Thank you, Caliban.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.239
Well, in the moment,
I felt that the man who sold his soul

15:49.323 --> 15:53.994
was not worthy of damnation,
so instead, I chose to show him mercy.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.329
Mercy?

15:57.831 --> 15:59.875
Mercy!

16:00.960 --> 16:03.295
What blasphemy.

16:03.879 --> 16:04.755
Blasphemy.

16:04.838 --> 16:09.885
The girl makes a mockery
out of our sacred prerogatives.

16:09.969 --> 16:14.098
Let Prince Caliban collect the next soul.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.266
He'll prove worthy.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.144
Indeed, I would relish...

16:20.479 --> 16:21.772
such a task.

16:21.855 --> 16:23.190
Does my lady charge me so?

16:23.273 --> 16:24.733
She does not.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.653
Rome wasn't burned in a day.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.864
Sabrina has another soul to drag.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.993
If I'm not mistaken,
a man by the name of Jimmy Platt.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.078
And this time she'll get it right.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.248
Won't you, Sabrina?

16:40.124 --> 16:41.959
Did you just say Jimmy Platt?

16:44.545 --> 16:48.382
The distance between the pillars
and the length of the sacrilegious nave,

16:48.465 --> 16:50.092
the dark transepts and the choir

16:50.175 --> 16:52.928
-are multiples of the profane mean.

16:58.475 --> 17:01.603
-So, if angle A-B-C is equal--

17:10.821 --> 17:11.864
Who did this?

17:15.409 --> 17:16.577
Who did this?

17:17.536 --> 17:18.454
Answer me.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.792
All right, then, go.
Get out of my classroom.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.086
I don't have time
for such insolent behavior.

17:27.629 --> 17:29.590
Go, I said! You're dismissed.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.162
Guys! Guys!

18:42.246 --> 18:43.539
Crisis Fright Club meeting.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.375
Now.

18:48.418 --> 18:52.840
So, dragging souls to Hell
is like, what, your after-school job?

18:52.923 --> 18:54.550
Uh, kind of.

18:54.633 --> 18:58.345
But surprisingly,
that's not even the weirdest part.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.680
Look who's up next.

19:01.473 --> 19:02.516
Jimmy Platt.

19:04.184 --> 19:06.061
-Wait.
-The Jelly Frost ice cream guy?

19:06.145 --> 19:07.771
The smiley guy in the truck?

19:07.855 --> 19:08.689
I know.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.399
Crazy, right?

19:10.482 --> 19:11.942
What did he do that was so bad?

19:12.025 --> 19:13.777
I don't know. They don't tell me.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.737
They don't tell you?

19:16.446 --> 19:18.115
Well, then, how do you know
they deserve it?

19:18.198 --> 19:20.868
Well, I'm gonna have to figure it out
on a case-by-case basis.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.369
But the thing is,

19:22.452 --> 19:25.747
dragging Jimmy to Hell,
assuming he deserves it,

19:25.831 --> 19:28.834
could be the key to saving Nick.
But I need your help.

19:29.376 --> 19:32.004
When I do drag Jimmy's soul
to the very bad place,

19:32.087 --> 19:34.464
it'll leave behind his freshly dead body,

19:34.548 --> 19:37.801
which, if we move fast enough,
so there's not much decay,

19:37.885 --> 19:40.554
we can use as a new prison
for the Dark Lord.

19:40.637 --> 19:41.930
Instead of Nick's body.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.390
So, it's like <i>Freaky Friday.</i>

19:43.473 --> 19:45.517
It's called a soul transference,
but kind of.

19:45.601 --> 19:49.813
So, if you follow me
in the Spellman mortuary hearse,

19:49.897 --> 19:51.481
once I get Mr. Platt's soul out...

19:51.565 --> 19:53.901
We can go body-snatch his body.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.694
Okay, fine, but I'm driving.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.404
Wait, why do you always get to drive?

19:57.487 --> 19:59.406
I'm the only one of us
who has a license, Theo.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.742
-Wait, what about the pep rally?
-It shouldn't take long.

20:01.825 --> 20:04.036
I mean, we know where he parks.

20:04.119 --> 20:07.080
We just have to go and do it.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.128
Are you sure about this?
What if someone catches us?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.339
You mean like your girlfriend, Dorcas?

20:16.131 --> 20:17.382
Relax.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.010
No one's been down here in weeks.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.363
What was that?

20:40.197 --> 20:42.407
It felt like something fell on my hair,

20:43.200 --> 20:44.785
like a bug or something.

20:46.161 --> 20:47.746
Now who needs to relax?

20:57.172 --> 20:58.715
They called me a bitch.

21:01.677 --> 21:02.511
Me.

21:03.178 --> 21:05.097
They probably meant that ironically.

21:05.722 --> 21:08.600
Would any of them have
ever called Faustus a bitch? No.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.644
-No.
-And he was a little bitch.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.396
He was a bit of a bitch, wasn't he?

21:13.146 --> 21:15.065
-Ms. Spellman.
-What? Melvin?

21:15.148 --> 21:16.400
What... happened?

21:16.483 --> 21:18.902
It's Elspeth. She hath come undone.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.153
She tried to kill me.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.535
This is nuts.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.620
We're in high school.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.540
We should be worried about midterms,
not...

21:33.000 --> 21:35.627
not dragging the friendly neighborhood
ice cream man to Hell.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.170
Let's just stick to the plan.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.672
We can freak out later.

21:38.755 --> 21:42.634
Now, when you see me walking away,
you probably won't see his soul,

21:42.718 --> 21:46.847
but his body should slump dead,
which is when you guys rush out, and...

21:46.930 --> 21:49.433
- Steal the corpse.
-Steal the corpse, yeah.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.124
Well, hello there.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.626
You got a Jolly Frost flavor
in mind today?

22:17.044 --> 22:18.045
Hi, Jimmy.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.046
Mr. Platt.

22:19.963 --> 22:21.173
I'm here to collect you.

22:23.925 --> 22:26.595
Well, now, you're not the gentleman
I made my agreement with.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.430
No. I'm new.

22:28.513 --> 22:29.514
Huh.

22:29.723 --> 22:32.851
Well, I've got my extension fee
all lined up for you, as usual.

22:33.769 --> 22:34.936
Extension fee?

22:35.020 --> 22:37.189
Yes. Extension of my contract.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.775
Seven more years of life in exchange
for an innocent soul.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.068
As soon as I finish my shift,

22:41.151 --> 22:43.403
we can go, and I'll cut
her little heart out and eat it.

22:43.987 --> 22:44.821
What?

22:45.947 --> 22:48.241
Are you talking about sacrificing a child?

22:48.325 --> 22:49.326
You betcha.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.620
Doesn't get more innocent
than a little girl.

22:54.164 --> 22:59.169
Oh, golly, you truly have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

23:00.712 --> 23:04.257
Why don't you run along and go check
with your boss and get back to me, okay?

23:04.341 --> 23:06.551
<i>I am</i> the boss.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.345
And I brought backup.

23:11.890 --> 23:15.769
Well, now, you might wanna
keep your distance, big fella.

23:15.852 --> 23:16.812
Both of you.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.689
'Cause that little darlin'
I have waiting for you,

23:19.898 --> 23:21.775
no one knows where she is but me.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.986
So, if you or your friend here
try to take me to Hell,

23:25.654 --> 23:26.655
she dies.

23:27.364 --> 23:28.657
She starves to death.

23:29.574 --> 23:30.450
Or worse.

23:31.535 --> 23:37.165
So, you can either accept my payment
for the extension, or you can piss off.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.792
Either way, it's your choice.

23:39.042 --> 23:41.420
- Ice cream!
-Well, hello there.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.089
You guys have a Jolly Frost flavor
in mind today?

23:44.172 --> 23:46.800
- Chocolate ice cream!
- Yes.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.761
Four chocolate cones coming right up.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.098
What happened?

23:53.306 --> 23:54.182
I don't know.

23:54.349 --> 23:56.560
But he tried to offer me a child

23:56.643 --> 23:58.895
in exchange for an extension
to his contract.

23:58.979 --> 24:02.232
As if my horrible father has made
that sort of deal with him before.

24:02.315 --> 24:03.358
I can't drag him to hell,

24:03.442 --> 24:07.070
because he's keeping a little girl trapped
somewhere in Greendale.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.864
We... we have to find her.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.991
Oh, we're going to.

24:11.324 --> 24:14.453
And then I will personally burn
Jimmy Platt's pitch-black soul

24:14.536 --> 24:15.412
in Hell myself.

24:18.290 --> 24:21.293
But first, I gotta talk to the old boss.

24:25.338 --> 24:26.840
What's the deal with Jimmy Platt?

24:28.258 --> 24:29.593
Jimmy, yeah.

24:30.093 --> 24:31.136
He's a character.

24:33.388 --> 24:39.394
Devoutly pious, or he was
until he got into a horrendous car crash

24:39.478 --> 24:41.062
a very long time ago.

24:42.230 --> 24:46.693
<i>Mangled and dying,</i>
<i>he cried out to his false god.</i>

24:46.776 --> 24:49.279
<i>"Save me. Save me."</i>

24:51.865 --> 24:54.784
<i>Only I got there first.</i>

24:59.039 --> 25:02.417
I offered him the simple standard deal:
another seven years for his soul.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.377
He agreed. They always do.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.463
And have you been giving him extensions?

25:06.546 --> 25:09.633
After seven years, I came to collect,
but he begged for more time.

25:09.716 --> 25:11.092
So, I told him the price.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.469
A child's soul.

25:12.552 --> 25:14.387
An innocent soul.

25:14.471 --> 25:17.432
I never said it had to be a child.
That was his predilection.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.142
You turned him into a murderer.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.561
No, he was one.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.815
Well, I'm not issuing any more extensions.

25:25.899 --> 25:28.151
Then don't. You're Queen.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.529
-Drag him to Hell.
-I can't.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.197
He's got a little girl tied up somewhere.

25:32.280 --> 25:37.202
Suit yourself, but if you don't bring
Jimmy Platt to heel,

25:37.410 --> 25:40.580
then you will lose your throne
as surely as I'm sitting here.

25:40.664 --> 25:45.460
And Caliban has all of Hell backing him,
and he plans to expand into this realm.

25:45.919 --> 25:48.380
Do your job!

25:48.838 --> 25:51.591
Or unchain me, so I can do it.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.479
Ambrose, look there.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.605
It's him.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.651
-Earth and Hell, it's him.
-Wait. Wait, wait.

26:10.151 --> 26:13.238
Look, he's in the middle
of some sort of ritual.

26:13.321 --> 26:15.073
Perhaps it's a summoning ritual.

26:15.865 --> 26:17.117
But summoning what?

26:21.037 --> 26:23.832
I call upon
the watery guardians of the west.

26:23.915 --> 26:27.085
Place of endings, of the coming darkness.

26:28.378 --> 26:32.757
I cast out the Devouring Worm,
meal of the Deep One.

26:34.217 --> 26:38.096
And offer unto thee
a fresh feast of witches' blood,

26:38.179 --> 26:39.514
if you rise.

26:40.640 --> 26:44.352
Rise, Deep One, and feed!

27:09.169 --> 27:10.795
What is that?

27:12.839 --> 27:14.966
Deep One, welcome.

27:17.844 --> 27:18.845
Thank you.

27:20.847 --> 27:22.807
You shall have your payment presently.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.119
Come out, my sacrifices.

27:43.536 --> 27:44.704
Sacrifices?

27:51.920 --> 27:54.923
Wait, no. No, he means to slaughter them.

28:03.306 --> 28:05.809
One of us should save the children,
whilst the other one of us...

28:05.892 --> 28:07.560
Oh, for Lucifer's sake.

28:14.776 --> 28:17.070
Hello, daughter. Found me at last, eh?

28:17.946 --> 28:19.030
Are you okay?

28:19.739 --> 28:21.449
Are you okay? Hel--

28:32.544 --> 28:35.839
For your troubles,
I'll kill you and bury you in the sand.

28:36.297 --> 28:38.425
You know, I don't believe that you will.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.051
No.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.178
Put it... put it down.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.180
Put it down!

28:44.597 --> 28:47.809
You have no idea of the annihilation
that's capable of.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.103
What is it?

28:50.603 --> 28:53.148
I've spent 15 years
inside a temporal church

28:53.231 --> 28:54.441
of my own creation,

28:54.524 --> 28:58.778
purifying myself to wield magics
you couldn't possibly fathom.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.321
All for my prize.

29:00.405 --> 29:03.116
Fifteen years? You've been gone a month.

29:03.199 --> 29:07.120
For you a month,
for me here 15 glorious years.

29:07.203 --> 29:08.538
These are more of your lies.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.082
Can you not feel it, Prudence?

29:11.833 --> 29:13.585
The Dark Lord dethroned,

29:13.668 --> 29:15.754
the pits of the abyss unmanned.

29:18.631 --> 29:21.342
The old ones are returning
to claim the Earth.

29:22.635 --> 29:23.553
And then...

29:25.305 --> 29:26.639
the eldritch terrors.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.358
Return to me the egg,

29:37.942 --> 29:42.197
and we'll bear witness
to the birth of the unspeakable.

29:42.822 --> 29:44.491
Together, we can--

29:55.543 --> 29:57.086
Harvey and I went to the police station.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.172
We found a bulletin board
of all the missing persons.

29:59.255 --> 30:02.300
This girl disappeared
from a playground three days ago.

30:02.383 --> 30:03.968
She's so young.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.387
Can you see where she is
with your cunning?

30:06.471 --> 30:09.307
Not off a flyer,
but if I had something of hers.

30:09.390 --> 30:11.434
Something she's touched.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.144
If I could hold it in my hands,

30:13.394 --> 30:15.104
-I could--
-Hey, Sabrina. Hey, Roz.

30:15.188 --> 30:16.022
Hi, Sabrina.

30:16.105 --> 30:18.399
-Hey, Lizzie.
-Hey, girls. We're going to the mall

30:18.483 --> 30:20.485
to get our nails and hair done
before the pep rally.

30:20.568 --> 30:21.694
It's a cheer tradition.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.531
Oh, man, Roz and I can't.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.032
We've, um...

30:28.451 --> 30:31.579
Sabrina's taking me to the doctor
for a check-up.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.122
It's for my eyes.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.833
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

30:34.916 --> 30:36.876
Thoughts and prayers, of course.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.379
But we'll see you at the rally, right?
We need your mad skills.

30:39.462 --> 30:41.005
Oh, most definitely.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.507
We will totes be there.

30:42.590 --> 30:43.716
See you then.

30:44.300 --> 30:45.969
Are you gonna drive or what?

30:46.052 --> 30:48.555
I can't believe we're ditching
the cool kids to play cat and mouse

30:48.638 --> 30:49.472
with a serial killer.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.641
-Well, what choice do we have?
- None.

30:51.724 --> 30:55.186
So, what's the plan?
Are we gonna find this guy, kidnap him?

30:55.270 --> 30:57.647
Well, actually,
I appreciate the gusto, Harvey,

30:57.730 --> 30:59.190
but I think for this next step,

30:59.274 --> 31:02.277
it might be a little less suspicious
if it's just me and Roz.

31:09.617 --> 31:12.495
Excuse me, are you Lucy Anderson's mother?

31:13.913 --> 31:16.416
When we first heard
about how Lucy went missing,

31:16.499 --> 31:18.960
we... we just wanted to help.

31:21.421 --> 31:24.382
I am so sorry about your daughter.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.135
The police have no leads.

31:27.635 --> 31:31.681
How could she just disappear
without a trace?

31:33.892 --> 31:35.018
She's still alive.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.561
She has to be.

31:41.024 --> 31:42.191
Mrs. Anderson,

31:43.151 --> 31:46.362
do you have any pictures of Lucy
that we could borrow

31:47.113 --> 31:49.574
to make flyers and help get the word out?

31:52.535 --> 31:53.745
Or, actually,

31:54.579 --> 31:56.164
could you tell us about these?

31:59.083 --> 32:01.586
Lucy collects pinwheels.

32:03.129 --> 32:05.340
She had one with her when...

32:06.049 --> 32:07.133
when she...

32:09.677 --> 32:11.554
I'll see if I can find you a picture.

32:32.867 --> 32:35.578
-Well, hello.
- May I please have a chocolate pop?

32:48.633 --> 32:49.968
I found one.

32:53.596 --> 32:55.223
This was taken last spring.

32:59.811 --> 33:03.022
We're going to find Lucy
and bring her home, Mrs. Anderson.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.566
And the man who took her
will be condemned to Hell

33:05.650 --> 33:07.402
and tortured there for all eternity.

33:08.611 --> 33:09.487
Oh.

33:10.613 --> 33:13.616
Well, thank you. That's--

33:13.700 --> 33:17.412
You wouldn't mind if we took one
of Lucy's pinwheels with us, would you?

33:19.163 --> 33:20.123
No...

33:21.457 --> 33:23.042
you wouldn't mind at all.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.753
I wouldn't mind at all.

33:26.295 --> 33:27.922
You should get some rest.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.591
-Forget we ever came here.
-Forget you ever came here.

33:43.229 --> 33:44.647
Sorry. You okay?

33:44.731 --> 33:46.774
I'm so sorry.
I wasn't looking where I was going.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.359
Yeah, it's no biggie.

33:49.902 --> 33:51.070
Here you go.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.030
Oh.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.365
I'm Theo Putnam.

33:55.033 --> 33:55.950
Robin.

33:56.451 --> 33:57.744
-Uh...

33:58.161 --> 33:59.370
I just started here.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.165
I don't know where my locker is.
Any ideas?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.043
Um...

34:06.919 --> 34:09.130
Yeah, I think you're over this way.

34:10.673 --> 34:12.258
So, where'd you move from?

34:12.925 --> 34:14.886
It's just some tiny boring town.

34:15.511 --> 34:18.765
Oh, if there's one thing about Greendale,
it is not boring.

34:26.773 --> 34:28.232
-Amazing.

34:28.316 --> 34:29.150
Yup.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.153
-Thank you.
-No problem.

34:35.698 --> 34:36.657
Hey, wait.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.829
Are you... I heard there's a pep rally
going on later.

34:42.580 --> 34:43.706
Are you gonna go?

34:48.586 --> 34:52.090
We circumnavigated the world
to find and execute Blackwood.

34:52.173 --> 34:53.883
Do not tell me
that your resolve is softened.

34:53.966 --> 34:57.095
No, but what was he doing here?

34:57.178 --> 34:59.847
And all of that talk of the old ones
and the eldritch terrors.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.016
-We need to find out.
-What are you proposing, Ambrose?

35:02.100 --> 35:04.143
We take him and the egg back to Greendale.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.521
There, we will interrogate your father,

35:06.604 --> 35:09.816
and then he can pay for his crimes
in front of the entire Church of Night.

35:11.317 --> 35:12.360
No.

35:12.443 --> 35:15.822
I want justice now.
He should be dead already.

35:16.322 --> 35:19.450
- Please don't kill him.
-Don't kill our father. Please.

35:24.539 --> 35:25.498
Judas?

35:27.333 --> 35:28.209
Leticia?

35:28.292 --> 35:30.461
My name is Judith.

35:33.756 --> 35:36.384
Higher magicks of time and space.

35:55.027 --> 35:56.028
Agatha.

35:57.029 --> 35:57.864
What are you doing?

35:58.447 --> 36:00.241
Nothing, Lady Blackwood.

36:05.371 --> 36:06.330
Stop that at once.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.457
Stop what, Lady Blackwood?

36:08.541 --> 36:11.627
-Don't call me that.
-Or you'll what, Lady Blackwood?

36:11.711 --> 36:13.546
I'm not Lady Blackwood.

36:13.629 --> 36:14.463
That's right.

36:14.547 --> 36:15.631
You're a bitch!

36:17.800 --> 36:19.552
Zelda Phiona Spellman.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.981
What has got into you?

36:32.064 --> 36:33.107
I've no idea.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.571
It's called a whispering gallery spell.

36:38.654 --> 36:41.657
Like when you're standing under a dome,
and you whisper something into a wall,

36:41.741 --> 36:43.576
and your voice travels somewhere else.

36:43.659 --> 36:47.455
If Lucy still has her pinwheel,
I might be able to.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.167
<i>Audi vocem meu.</i>

36:51.918 --> 36:53.252
<i>Audi vocem meu.</i>

36:53.920 --> 36:55.254
<i>Audi vocem meu.</i>

36:55.755 --> 36:57.256
<i>Audi vocem meu.</i>

37:00.051 --> 37:01.260
Hello?<i> </i>Lucy?

37:01.594 --> 37:02.428
Are...

37:02.720 --> 37:03.721
are you there?

37:07.892 --> 37:09.727
<i>Hello? Who... who is that?</i>

37:11.354 --> 37:12.355
A friend.

37:12.563 --> 37:15.441
I'm trying to help you, Lucy,
but first, you have to tell me,

37:15.524 --> 37:16.984
<i>is there a man with you?</i>

37:17.735 --> 37:20.029
No, he said he'd come back,
but it's been a while.

37:20.571 --> 37:22.990
<i>Can you call my mom to come and get me?</i>

37:23.074 --> 37:24.408
Can you see where you are?

37:24.825 --> 37:26.827
<i>It's a big refrigerator.</i>

37:29.080 --> 37:30.039
It's a freezer.

37:30.456 --> 37:32.166
He's got her in a freezer.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.084
Okay.

37:33.584 --> 37:34.502
Okay, Lucy,

37:34.585 --> 37:37.421
can you read anything in the refrigerator
that tells you where you are,

37:37.505 --> 37:38.631
so I can find you?

37:39.090 --> 37:40.007
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

37:40.633 --> 37:43.636
Are you close? I'm getting really sleepy.

37:43.719 --> 37:45.763
No. Lucy, don't fall asleep.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.310
I'm coming. I'll be right there.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.147
<i>Lanuae magicae. Lanuae magicae.</i>

37:55.231 --> 37:57.275
-Sabrina, what are you doing?
-<i>Lanuae magicae.</i>

37:57.358 --> 37:58.734
<i>Lanuae magicae.</i>

37:58.818 --> 38:01.612
Maybe I can teleport,
using her voice as a beacon.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.740
Sabrina, you don't know where she is.
What if it's somewhere dangerous?

38:04.824 --> 38:07.785
It's like Harvey said, Roz,
we don't have a choice.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.288
<i>Lanuae magicae. Lanuae magicae.</i>

38:10.371 --> 38:13.207
Brina, I don't like this.
You're going in blind.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.543
I seek this child, cold and bound.

38:15.626 --> 38:17.670
-What is lost must now be found.
-'Brina!

38:28.431 --> 38:30.558
Lucy, wake up.
Lucy, wake up.

38:31.100 --> 38:34.061
It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna get you home. I'm gonna--

38:34.145 --> 38:35.313
Get you out of here?

38:37.356 --> 38:41.652
Well, now, has anyone ever told you
you're a dumb pudding?

38:42.194 --> 38:45.698
For instance, did you know
that some sigils are one way?

38:48.242 --> 38:50.828
You can zap yourself into them,
but you can't zap yourself out.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.750
<i>Lanuae magicae.</i>

38:57.209 --> 38:58.044
Oh, no.

38:58.127 --> 39:00.171
Oh, yes.<i> </i>You're trapped.

39:00.254 --> 39:02.465
Lickety splickety.

39:02.548 --> 39:04.258
Like my friend Lucy there.

39:04.717 --> 39:08.429
Don't worry. I'll be back
when you're frozen through and through.

39:08.846 --> 39:10.723
There's a pep rally at the high school.

39:10.806 --> 39:13.142
I bet I get a lot of customers tonight.

39:18.981 --> 39:20.107
<i>I hate pointing out</i>

39:20.191 --> 39:22.360
<i>that the novice Queen</i>
<i>is running out of time.</i>

39:24.195 --> 39:25.279
You'll learn.

39:28.574 --> 39:30.326
Caliban, was it?

39:30.743 --> 39:34.622
Sabrina may be intractable,
infuriating, and naive,

39:34.955 --> 39:37.625
but she is a Morningstar in her bones.

39:37.708 --> 39:43.589
And she will deliver the soul to us,
as dictated by the Book of the Beast.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.219
Now, while we're waiting,

39:48.302 --> 39:52.139
may I offer you gentlemen...

39:53.391 --> 39:54.600
some refreshments?

39:57.895 --> 40:03.025
Minion, help me fetch our guests
something to drink.

40:03.109 --> 40:06.028
- Useless wench.
-Something to get them in a stupor.

40:06.112 --> 40:09.532
Feel free to add your own piss and bile
to the concoction.

40:13.035 --> 40:15.246
Meanwhile,
I'll see where our wayward Queen

40:15.329 --> 40:17.164
has gotten herself to this time.

40:22.878 --> 40:24.380
There we go.

40:24.463 --> 40:27.091
Nice cup of tranquility tea.

40:27.174 --> 40:28.717
Calm you right down.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.094
Thank you, Hildy.

40:30.511 --> 40:31.512
With some cream?

40:31.595 --> 40:33.681
Oh, some cream.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.559
Striking a student.

40:36.642 --> 40:38.144
Never in my life.

40:38.853 --> 40:41.647
I slapped Agatha
before I even knew what I was doing.

40:41.730 --> 40:43.607
Ah, we've all wanted to slap Agatha.

40:44.984 --> 40:48.195
What's happening to us?
We're coming apart.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.905
Oh, I know.

40:50.614 --> 40:52.241
Oh! Eugh.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.660
Oh, that cream was fresh this morning.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.583
Curdled cream in a witch's cup.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.877
It can only mean one thing.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.337
The Devil's afoot.

41:06.005 --> 41:07.381
Well, it can't be.

41:07.715 --> 41:11.719
The Dark Lord is in Hell
trapped inside Nicholas. Isn't he?

41:11.802 --> 41:13.304
-What?

41:14.763 --> 41:15.723
Mistress Spellman?

41:16.307 --> 41:17.808
What's Elspeth done now?

41:21.687 --> 41:23.647
Agatha found this in her hair.

41:28.110 --> 41:29.987
That beetle is telltale.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.991
The Dark Lord is here somewhere.

41:34.992 --> 41:35.951
Zelda?

41:36.702 --> 41:37.536
What?

41:37.620 --> 41:39.872
Don't move.

41:47.171 --> 41:50.341
You didn't strike Agatha. He did.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.010
This is all his influence.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.936
Search the Academy,
but go in pairs.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.521
Do not go off alone.

42:03.604 --> 42:06.232
And if you should find,
or even sense, the Dark Lord's presence,

42:06.315 --> 42:07.858
do not engage with him.

42:07.942 --> 42:10.736
And remember,
the second the flame flickers blue,

42:10.819 --> 42:12.488
you rush back here to us.

42:17.284 --> 42:20.454
Lucy. Lucy, no.
We have to stay awake until...

42:24.041 --> 42:28.963
Ball of fire, ball of flame,
gather for me bright and plain.

42:31.549 --> 42:32.675
It's no use.

42:33.509 --> 42:34.802
We're doomed.

42:34.885 --> 42:35.803
Unless...

42:38.180 --> 42:39.181
Hello?

42:40.015 --> 42:41.767
Who is it? Roz?

42:42.893 --> 42:44.520
No, it's me, Your Majesty.

42:44.603 --> 42:47.690
And it's true what they say:
a regent's work is never done.

42:49.608 --> 42:52.111
Lilith? How'd you find me?

42:52.194 --> 42:55.155
Well, I found Miss Walker.
She filled me in on your antics,

42:55.239 --> 42:58.367
and then it was just a matter
of picking up your psychic trail.

42:58.450 --> 43:00.286
I leave behind a psychic trail?

43:00.369 --> 43:02.121
Like a slug leaves slime.

43:03.956 --> 43:05.624
Lucy. Lucy, wake up.

43:05.874 --> 43:08.627
Wake up. We're gonna get you home.

43:09.211 --> 43:11.547
Do you think perhaps
you wouldn't have found yourself trapped

43:11.630 --> 43:14.508
in a walk-in freezer if you'd simply done
what was asked of you?

43:14.592 --> 43:16.635
Instead of dithering around
with your friends?

43:16.719 --> 43:19.054
I was trying to find a way
to use Jimmy Platt to save Nick.

43:19.138 --> 43:22.808
Of course, it's about a boy.
Sabrina, you're out of time.

43:22.891 --> 43:25.561
Well, then, help me.
I have to get Lucy back to her parents.

43:25.644 --> 43:30.649
I'll see to the girl, but would you please
do your damn job as a Morningstar?

43:31.942 --> 43:32.860
Count on it.

43:42.620 --> 43:43.704
I believe this is yours.

43:45.080 --> 43:46.081
Lucy.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.502
Wait. Who are you?

43:51.420 --> 43:52.421
Who am I?

43:55.215 --> 43:56.759
Why, I'm Mary Wardwell.

43:57.426 --> 43:58.969
I teach at Baxter High.

44:03.641 --> 44:04.892
Go, Ravens, go!

44:04.975 --> 44:07.519
Go, Ravens, go!
Go, Ravens, go!

44:07.603 --> 44:10.898
Go, Ravens, go! Go, Ravens, go!

44:15.653 --> 44:17.154
Can I ask you, Robin,

44:17.237 --> 44:21.867
did the ice cream guy
say anything weird to you at all?

44:21.950 --> 44:23.702
No. Why would he?

44:26.038 --> 44:27.039
No reason.

44:32.252 --> 44:33.754
Why don't we just arrest him?

44:33.962 --> 44:37.216
Or, like, beat the shit out of him?

44:40.010 --> 44:41.595
Remember what Sabrina said:

44:42.346 --> 44:45.474
you and Theo are back up,
I'm part of the distraction.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.353
This is so messed up.

44:50.145 --> 44:51.897
Sabrina almost froze to death.

44:51.980 --> 44:52.898
I know.

44:53.273 --> 44:54.566
But she's got this.

44:55.359 --> 44:57.361
Roz. Hey, Roz.

45:00.364 --> 45:01.865
Go, Ravens, go!

45:08.956 --> 45:13.335
Go, Ravens, go! Go, Ravens, go!
Go, Ravens, go!

45:43.699 --> 45:45.451
Well, now, little fella,
what can I get you?

45:45.534 --> 45:46.952
A chocolate pop, please.

45:49.246 --> 45:50.330
Coming right up.

45:55.002 --> 45:58.046
I scream, you scream,
we all scream for ice cream.

45:58.130 --> 45:59.590
Right, Mr. Platt?

46:01.216 --> 46:02.342
You again.

46:03.093 --> 46:04.678
How did you get out of the freezer?

46:04.762 --> 46:06.054
A friend found me.

46:06.138 --> 46:09.224
And Lucy's safe,
so no more threats, Jimmy.

46:09.808 --> 46:11.351
My deal was with the Dark Lord.

46:11.435 --> 46:14.646
Yes, but Hell's under new management now.

46:15.272 --> 46:16.106
Mine!

46:18.442 --> 46:19.651
Help! Help!

46:20.861 --> 46:23.739
You're going to pay for your crimes,
Mr. Platt.

46:24.281 --> 46:26.450
For a very long time.

46:55.521 --> 46:57.815
Burn this trash,
won't you, Lilith?

46:57.898 --> 47:02.069
And feel free to get creative
with his suffering.

47:02.152 --> 47:04.696
Thy wish is our command, Queen,

47:05.697 --> 47:09.409
but I'm not sure how much use
you'll get from his body once I'm through.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.203
I'll find another one.

47:11.411 --> 47:12.329
Somehow.

47:14.456 --> 47:15.958
This proves nothing.

47:16.041 --> 47:17.376
A single soul.

47:17.876 --> 47:19.378
The child cannot rule.

47:20.045 --> 47:21.922
I'm not here to get your blessing.

47:22.005 --> 47:25.717
I accepted my birthright
to keep Hell where it belongs,

47:25.801 --> 47:27.427
away from the mortal realm.

47:28.053 --> 47:29.263
But that's not enough.

47:29.721 --> 47:33.183
The old ways,
my father's ways, are broken.

47:34.142 --> 47:36.687
Hell needs a makeover, fellas.

47:36.770 --> 47:39.815
How dare you speak to us this way?

47:39.898 --> 47:41.775
I'll speak however I please.

47:42.276 --> 47:44.111
You forget yourself, Beelzebub.

47:44.570 --> 47:46.196
I'm your sovereign.

47:46.947 --> 47:50.284
And the reformation of Hell starts now.

48:05.299 --> 48:07.968
Aunties... I'm home.

48:08.844 --> 48:10.721
-What's for dinner?
- Finally.

48:11.805 --> 48:13.807
Well, do you care to explain yourself?

48:13.891 --> 48:17.185
Oh, I'm sorry I missed your first day
at the Academy. I had this problem.

48:17.269 --> 48:19.980
How many secrets are you keeping from us?

48:20.564 --> 48:23.025
You didn't happen to go to Hell

48:23.108 --> 48:26.653
and bring back your father, the Dark Lord,
and stick him in the bowels of the Academy

48:26.737 --> 48:27.821
without telling us, did you?

48:27.905 --> 48:30.574
Putting what's left of the coven,
not to mention the entire world,

48:30.657 --> 48:33.243
in grave peril,
just so you can see your boyfriend.

48:33.327 --> 48:35.829
-That's not why I did it.
- Oh, I know why you did it.

48:35.913 --> 48:39.583
Cassius delivered a stack of books
with rituals about soul transference.

48:40.167 --> 48:42.210
I thought the Dark Lord was bad.

48:42.294 --> 48:44.212
I thought he was dangerous,

48:44.296 --> 48:47.674
but Lilith preserve us
from his demented lovesick daughter.

48:47.758 --> 48:49.885
I couldn't just leave Nick in Hell.

48:51.011 --> 48:53.805
Every second he was down there,
he was in torment.

48:53.889 --> 48:56.016
Aunties, every second he was in pain.

48:56.099 --> 48:57.476
We know, darling.

48:58.477 --> 48:59.728
And it's my fault.

49:00.896 --> 49:01.897
He did it for me.

49:02.606 --> 49:05.108
I couldn't just wash my hands of him.

49:05.192 --> 49:08.445
I owed it to Nick to at least try
and get Lucifer out of his body

49:08.528 --> 49:10.197
-and into someone else's.
- Whose?

49:10.280 --> 49:12.616
Where do you expect to find
another vessel strong enough

49:12.699 --> 49:16.078
to withstand being turned into
a flesh Acheron for the Devil himself?

49:18.997 --> 49:19.915
Aunties.

49:22.167 --> 49:23.043
I'm home.

49:23.543 --> 49:25.128
Any chance of a cuppa?

49:32.177 --> 49:35.263
You were saying, Auntie Zee?

49:36.765 --> 49:39.434
Sorry, who are the tied-up children?

49:50.278 --> 49:51.863
Something's different about you.

49:51.947 --> 49:54.157
I dragged my first soul to Hell today.

49:55.242 --> 49:58.036
And how did that make you feel,
all that power?

49:58.620 --> 50:00.205
All that rage?

50:01.289 --> 50:03.458
Like I'm capable of anything.

50:04.793 --> 50:06.211
That's my girl.

50:06.294 --> 50:07.462
Even this.

50:08.338 --> 50:09.464
Meet your new jailer.

50:13.719 --> 50:14.803
Blackwood.

50:14.886 --> 50:16.346
Oh, that's right.

50:16.430 --> 50:17.723
You two know each other.

50:18.724 --> 50:22.227
That makes the soul transference
a little easier, doesn't it, Aunt Zee?

50:22.310 --> 50:23.186
Hmm...

50:23.895 --> 50:26.023
Still painful, I'm afraid.

50:30.694 --> 50:35.282
This, Judith and Judas, will be your room.

50:38.118 --> 50:42.205
You will be safe here
with lots of fun toys to play with

50:42.289 --> 50:43.832
and plenty of books to read.

50:43.915 --> 50:45.417
And don't worry, my dear siblings,

50:45.500 --> 50:48.545
we will be checking in on you
from time to time.

51:01.933 --> 51:03.518
They won't starve, will they?

51:04.811 --> 51:06.188
It's a living doll spell.

51:07.355 --> 51:12.360
They won't realize the passing of days,
nor feel hunger, nor pain.

51:17.991 --> 51:19.117
And the egg?

51:22.913 --> 51:26.083
We wait and see what hatches.

51:29.086 --> 51:30.295
In the meantime...

51:48.980 --> 51:52.067
Don't suppose you're looking to wrestle,
are you, Faustus?

51:52.150 --> 51:52.984
Wrestle?

51:53.568 --> 51:56.113
I've seen beyond the veil of this world,

51:56.863 --> 51:58.323
oh, mighty Satan.

51:58.990 --> 52:01.034
I know there are powers more vast

52:01.118 --> 52:05.872
and cosmic
than a single vainglorious fallen angel.

52:06.623 --> 52:08.333
Do you mean the old gods?

52:08.416 --> 52:11.545
What, the pagan monsters
who believe themselves deities?

52:11.628 --> 52:12.504
No.

52:13.463 --> 52:14.464
No.

52:15.048 --> 52:19.761
I speak of the eldritch terrors,
Lord Lucifer.

52:20.846 --> 52:22.597
Older than the oldest gods.

52:53.420 --> 52:54.754
Nick, it's okay.

52:56.381 --> 52:57.966
It's okay. You're home again.

52:59.176 --> 53:00.385
Sabrina.

53:03.054 --> 53:04.264
Is it really you?

53:06.349 --> 53:07.309
It is.

53:08.894 --> 53:09.936
It is me.

53:10.854 --> 53:12.230
Why are you crying?

53:25.285 --> 53:29.664
It's kinda weird to say,
especially after all the craziness, but...

53:31.583 --> 53:33.710
you were amazing tonight at the pep rally.

53:34.628 --> 53:35.587
Really?

53:37.547 --> 53:39.674
Do you think cheerleading suits me?

53:42.886 --> 53:44.137
Everything suits you.

54:00.820 --> 54:01.905
Do you hear that?

54:04.491 --> 54:05.700
You mean the wind?

54:10.830 --> 54:11.790
Harvey.

54:15.418 --> 54:17.796
<i>I've seen beyond the veil of this world.</i>

54:18.838 --> 54:22.842
<i>The old ones are returning</i>
