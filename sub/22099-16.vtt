I demand my rights
as a Colonial citizen

00:27.861 --> 00:30.279
to legal representation
and full due process.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.364
Do you?

00:31.448 --> 00:33.032
So what happens next?

00:33.117 --> 00:35.034
We give him his trial.

00:35.119 --> 00:37.286
My father was a priest.
My mother was an oracle.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.872
I've served a Battlestar
since I was 18 years old.

00:39.957 --> 00:44.377
When you elected me union president,
I promised I would keep us working.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.838
You must throw your body
on the gears and on the levers

00:46.922 --> 00:49.173
and on the machine itself
and make it stop!

00:49.258 --> 00:52.093
ALL: Strike! Strike!
Strike! Strike!

00:52.302 --> 00:53.720
You're pretending
like nothing's changed,

00:53.804 --> 00:57.140
that our lives are exactly like they
were before we went to New Caprica.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.391
But it is different.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.727
Yeah, I was just going through
a little rough patch.

01:00.811 --> 01:04.021
What if rough patches
are all we have left?

you're gonna be rehabbing mule engines
tonight so don't make after-dinner plans.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.203
Set and hold SOL check
rigged to SEC.

01:24.042 --> 01:27.086
FIGURSKI: I thought we were subbing out
mule maintenance to the civvies in Dogsville?

01:27.171 --> 01:29.839
Yeah, we don't got enough
mechanics down there.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.592
Check flow rate.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.927
POLLUX: Flow rate
steady at 290.

Hey, when are we getting
some rack around here, Chief?

01:39.475 --> 01:41.017
I'm standing double watches
the last two weeks.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.101
I know, I know.

01:42.186 --> 01:43.686
Plus, I still got
the ringing in my ears.

MAN: (MOCKINGLY)
The ringing in the ears!

01:46.356 --> 01:49.859

you. I've got ringing. What's that?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.402
POLLUX: Real funny, guys.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.948
Hey, fuse
indicators are out.

01:56.033 --> 01:59.869
Set the wing tank switch to fuel.
Power off. All right, tank off.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.288
That's it.
Kill the fueling stations.

02:02.372 --> 02:05.249
Pull the hose. Lt., you're
tanked up and ready to roll.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.543
Roger that, Chief.
Ready to roll.

chuck it in the cycler.

Fold my undies
the way I like?

02:21.809 --> 02:23.810
Frak off.
Oh, nice mouth.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.354
You think they let officers
talk like that?

02:26.438 --> 02:29.148
You're gonna have to change your
ways when you get them wings.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.275
I'm not getting wings.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.529
They rejected my application
for flight training.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.281
I thought you aced the written
exam. Interview went well?

02:37.366 --> 02:41.577
Yeah, well, it turns out I'm in a critical
position and my leaving would cause

02:41.662 --> 02:44.580
severe mission
degradation.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.250
That sucks.
Critical position, my ass.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.586
They just don't want knuckle-draggers
stinking up the pilot ready room.

Look, the CAG told me you got
bounced from flight training.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.135
I'm sorry about that.
It sucks.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.347
The truth is we need you down here,
you're the best avionics specialist we got.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.599
And she knows how
to fold a man's undies.

you crazy? I'll take you apart!

Hey! Shut up, Figurski!

03:10.524 --> 03:13.276
I'll pop you in the mouth
myself. Now get back to work.

Hey, hey, hey.
Listen to me.

03:17.739 --> 03:22.618

just as important as sitting in a cockpit.

Thanks, Chief.

Thank you.

You should've seen Tory's shoulder. I had
to help Cottle put it back into alignment.

You know, I am so busy, I hardly ever
make it down to this end of the ship.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.184

here for God knows how long

05:52.269 --> 05:53.853

the bulkheads.

always welcome in one of my beds.

In a manner of speaking.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.577
Do you have any better idea
what happened to your Raptor?

06:09.661 --> 06:11.829
We're still investigating
the situation.

06:11.913 --> 06:16.459
But it seems that the tylium was
seriously contaminated with impurities.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.086
Most likely, it's a problem
with the refining process.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.379
What the hell's
going on there?

06:20.464 --> 06:22.882
The refinery used to be the
most reliable ship in the fleet.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.260
Now every day I start with a
stack of messages from that chief.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.179
What is his name?
Zeno Fenner.

06:28.263 --> 06:33.225
Fenner, complaining about
working conditions and deliveries,

06:33.310 --> 06:37.897
and spare parts and compensation,
if you can believe that.

06:37.981 --> 06:43.444
We're on the run for our lives and the
guy wants to talk about overtime bonuses.

06:43.528 --> 06:47.239
We've been more than patient with
Fenner and his production problems.

06:48.492 --> 06:51.368
Two weeks of sitting here, waiting
for him to get his act together.

06:51.453 --> 06:56.832
I don't know about you, but I'm ready
to get back on the road to finding Earth.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.794
(WHISPERING) Is that
a hint of hope I hear?

07:00.670 --> 07:05.174
Is the skeptic suddenly decided that
we're on the road to Earth, after all?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.135
Have I ever doubted it?

07:14.810 --> 07:18.646
I've got people working 18 hour
shifts for the past six months.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.648
How long do you think
a man can keep that up?

07:20.732 --> 07:26.153
If the Cylons show up, we have enough
fuel to jump the entire fleet, what, once?

07:26.238 --> 07:28.030
Maybe twice?

07:29.449 --> 07:32.034
That's a margin that's
much too narrow for me.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.578
How about for you
and your men?

07:34.663 --> 07:37.498
You have a problem.
Fix it.

07:37.582 --> 07:42.711
Just get the gas flowing. And then
we'll talk, I promise you that.

07:42.796 --> 07:46.757
Then we'll talk.
It's always later.

07:46.842 --> 07:50.177
You know, it's funny
that when the gas flows,

07:50.262 --> 07:52.221
my phone calls
don't get returned.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.641
But the minute there's a glitch in the
fuel supply, I've got face time with

07:55.725 --> 07:57.977
the President
and the Admiral.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.395
Hmm...

07:59.688 --> 08:02.898
Maybe we should just start
having more glitches.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.567
Is that a threat?

08:04.651 --> 08:06.402
It's like the book says.

08:07.279 --> 08:10.823
"If you hear the people, you'll
never have to fear the people. "

08:10.907 --> 08:12.449
Did you say the book?

08:12.576 --> 08:13.576
Mmm-hmm.

08:13.660 --> 08:18.414
Guards, arrest him for extortion
and interrupting vital services

08:18.498 --> 08:19.832

08:19.916 --> 08:22.877
Go ahead, take him away. That's
it. Go. Out of here. Gone.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.587
Come with me, sir.

08:28.925 --> 08:29.925
What the hell was that?

08:30.010 --> 08:32.428
He was quoting
from Baltar's book.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.848
The ramblings that his lawyer
smuggled out of the brig?

08:35.932 --> 08:39.351
He's having it reprinted and
passed out among the Fleet

08:39.436 --> 08:43.272
and he's calling it My Triumphs,
My Mistakes, by Gaius Baltar.

08:44.566 --> 08:49.153
I am thinking of having a good
old-fashioned book-burning.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.489
Ooh, algae meatloaf,
starting to be a favorite.

08:52.574 --> 08:55.951
It's not for you.
Remember our little talk?

08:57.120 --> 08:59.663
Oh, but today's
my cheat day.

08:59.748 --> 09:02.291
The last three days
have been your cheat day.

09:03.418 --> 09:04.627
Really?

09:07.088 --> 09:09.173
You were moving
better yesterday.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.550
Is that how the bends
are supposed to work?

09:11.635 --> 09:15.721
I'm just upset about Seelix,
so I'm tensing up.

09:15.805 --> 09:19.725
They should've just told her right off
the bat what the fleet priorities are.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.645
Should've said that
they needed knuckle-draggers

09:22.729 --> 09:24.230
more than they need pilots.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.315
It isn't about
fleet priorities.

09:27.192 --> 09:30.861
We're not part of the ruling class,
so we're stuck doing the dirty work.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.947
The ruling class?
Where'd you get that?

09:33.031 --> 09:36.659
Something I read,
by Baltar.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.455
Those frakking rags making
their way around the fleet?

09:41.539 --> 09:44.583
I can't believe that anybody's
reading anything written by that guy.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.752
That's what I thought
too, but...

09:48.922 --> 09:53.259
You ever wonder why all the pilots and
the officers come from the rich Colonies,

09:53.343 --> 09:56.428
like Caprica,
and Virgon, Tauron?

09:56.513 --> 09:59.431
Well, all the knuckle-draggers
come from the poor Colonies,

09:59.516 --> 10:02.685
like Aerelon and Sagitarron
and Gemenon.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.979
Yeah, that's just
trash talk on the deck.

10:05.063 --> 10:09.275
Really? Name one officer on the
Fleet that comes from a poor Colony.

10:09.359 --> 10:12.027
Dualla, Lieutenant
Dualla's from Sagitarron.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.864
Case in point.
How did she get promoted?

10:15.949 --> 10:19.785
She married an officer
from Caprica.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.131
Zeno Fenner?
Do you know him?

10:32.215 --> 10:33.966
Did something
happen to Zeno?

10:34.050 --> 10:38.887
Arrested. Yes, sir. He was
in the union on New Caprica.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.472
He seemed like a good guy.
What'd he do?

10:40.557 --> 10:42.558
He pissed off
the President.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.562
But the bigger problem right
now is the refining operation.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.732
I need someone to go over there
and get that fuel ship moving again.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.151
Pick a team, get your gear and
be on the hangar deck in an hour.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.527
Yes, sir.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.826
I don't understand.
What happened to Zeno?

11:00.910 --> 11:02.536
He pissed off
the President.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.580
You mean, you can get
arrested for that now?

11:04.664 --> 11:06.665
I think the Admiral
was kidding.

Sure, but that's gone now.

New Caprica's gone, but all the
people in the union are still here.

11:18.928 --> 11:22.765
The only difference is now they don't
have anyone to stand up for them.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.641
I gotta go.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.688
I do hope you're
enjoying yourselves.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.858
It's not enough that you have to interrupt
my sleep and put filth in my food.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.861
Now you have to destroy my

do yourself a favor?

Hand over the pages

We've known that your lawyer was
smuggling the pages out of here for weeks.

So, we intercepted them and I'm afraid
I'm the only one who's read the book,

12:20.824 --> 12:24.201

to see how it ends.

12:26.371 --> 12:30.999

with the common man.

14:35.041 --> 14:38.168
we all started feeling a lot better
when we heard they were sending you.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.753
Oh, yeah?
You bet.

14:40.463 --> 14:41.463
I've been talking you up,

14:41.548 --> 14:44.174
telling everybody how
the union on New Caprica

14:44.259 --> 14:45.759
really stood up
for the little guy.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.094
Yeah, well...

14:51.683 --> 14:54.893
You're looking at the Fleet's
entire fuel supply of tylium.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.728
How many jumps
you think we got?

14:56.813 --> 14:59.523
We'll be lucky if we get
out of the system.

15:03.111 --> 15:06.154
Well, you'd better give us the
nickel tour, see where we stand.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.616
(LOUD MACHINERY NOISE)

15:42.358 --> 15:43.442
This is a big operation.

15:43.526 --> 15:46.695
Yeah, well, you should see this
place when it's up and running.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.698
Loud as an A-bomb
and just about as safe.

15:58.291 --> 16:03.712
Listen, we really need this
downtime. I mean, look around.

16:03.796 --> 16:07.758
Next time some machine fraks up,
it might not just take out a Raptor.

16:08.593 --> 16:12.596
This ship really is a big bomb
just waiting to go up.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.807
Yeah, look, I understand the
risk, but I need to see it working,

16:15.892 --> 16:19.102
so pull your guys off,
and let's fire it up.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.146
It ain't gonna work.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.315
You work here?

16:23.399 --> 16:26.401
This is Milo. He's the
best grease jockey I got.

16:27.028 --> 16:30.405
Milo, huh? Hey, Milo, so
why is it not gonna work?

16:31.908 --> 16:34.534
Something you guys aren't
telling me? Come on.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.544
Okay. I guess I'm just gonna
have to have a look for myself.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.926
Is that pressure relief?

16:53.388 --> 16:55.263
The seals are missing.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.348
They all are.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.142
Without pressure seals,
the machinery won't run.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.560
Well, where are they?

17:00.645 --> 17:02.729
Guess they got lost, huh?

17:02.814 --> 17:05.023
Guys, you can't be frakking
around with this stuff.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.609
The Admiral won't stand for
it. The Admiral can kiss my ass.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.111
Hey, hey!

17:10.196 --> 17:12.614
Come on, Chief,
you know what this is about.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.491
I guess when working
conditions improve

17:14.575 --> 17:18.328
and they let Zeno out of jail,
we'll be able to find those seals.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.705
Until then, it looks
like this ship

17:19.789 --> 17:21.832
isn't going to be refining
another drop of tylium.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.378
And that means this Fleet
isn't going anywhere.

17:28.881 --> 17:32.884
I've executed a search of the ship,
but the seals have not turned up.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.720
You know that
this is sabotage.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.305
I'm inclined
to have them locked up.

17:37.432 --> 17:40.726
Sir, please, they could've rigged
something to have me injured.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.019
They could have contaminated
the fuel on purpose

17:43.104 --> 17:45.188
and left all of our ships
dead in the air.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.398
Good Gods.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.067
All they did do was buy
themselves some time.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.903
The machinery does
need overhauling.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.656
There's a reason that the
quality control is failing.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.159
Do you realize that most
of the workers on that ship

17:57.243 --> 18:00.871
have not had a day off since the
original attack on the Colonies?

18:00.955 --> 18:03.081
It's like slave labor.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.666
Don't be absurd.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.169
The men and women aboard
that ship are stuck there.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.754
They can't leave,
they can't transfer.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.422
They have no control
over their lives.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.340
And the work is hard,
we know that.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.135
Do they think they're having a
picnic on the algae processing plant

18:15.219 --> 18:17.345
or munitions
or waste processing?

18:17.430 --> 18:20.640
The fleet is filled with ships with
people working under horrific conditions

18:20.725 --> 18:22.601
and nobody's having
a good time.

18:22.685 --> 18:26.104
Well, I think that if we at least
release Zeno and start talking to them

18:26.189 --> 18:28.523
about improving working
conditions and living conditions,

18:28.608 --> 18:31.735
that the protest will go away,
they'll return the pressure seals

18:31.819 --> 18:34.780
and we'll get the fuel
contamination problem under control.

18:34.864 --> 18:38.366
Extortion is not an
acceptable method of protest.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.577
What are the names
of the leaders?

18:45.625 --> 18:48.710
Just Cabott. I will issue
a warrant for his arrest.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.379
Put him in the brig,
let him sweat it out.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.883
Admiral, Madam President,
they're just trying to...

18:54.967 --> 18:57.010
Chief, uh-uh. We're done.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.900
(SIGHS)

19:18.157 --> 19:20.867
I'm gonna go check
on Cabott and Zeno.

Chief?

19:38.219 --> 19:39.678
Hey.
Hey.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.721
You gotta get him
out of here.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.143
What the hell
happened to his hands?

19:47.228 --> 19:49.563
I wake up in the middle of the
night, he's scratching the walls.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.815
He just keeps scratching them
until his fingers are bleeding.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.942
I won't say,
it don't matter...

19:54.026 --> 19:57.696
He was in Cylon detention
on New Caprica, you remember?

19:57.780 --> 20:00.115
He came out all squirrelly,
and this is not helping.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.742
Come on, you've got
to get him out of here.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.786
(WHIMPERING)

Come on, Galen! You've
got to get him out of here!

20:18.467 --> 20:20.093
Cabott? I won't say. No, I won't...

20:20.177 --> 20:22.137
Cabott, look at me.

20:23.514 --> 20:25.473
Cabott, listen to me.
Where are the seals?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.392
I won't say. It doesn't
matter. It doesn't matter.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.269
Cabott, I can get you out
of here. Where are the seals?

20:29.353 --> 20:31.646
Tell me where the seals are. I
won't say. It doesn't matter...

20:31.772 --> 20:34.983
For Gods sakes, get him out of here!
It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!

20:35.067 --> 20:38.528
Where are the seals?
Where are they?

20:38.654 --> 20:41.031
It doesn't matter. It doesn't
matter! Where are the seals?

20:41.157 --> 20:44.326

matter! Where are they?

20:45.828 --> 20:49.414
All right? They're in
the center stern air vent!

to release them.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.109
All right,
that's the last one.

21:18.194 --> 21:21.237
Let's fire this up,
get back to work.

Yes, sir.

How old are you?
Twelve.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.126
Almost.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.587
But I can run
every machine we got.

21:37.672 --> 21:41.049
Only thing I haven't done
is turn the whole thing on.

21:42.885 --> 21:44.427

22:32.935 --> 22:35.061
TYROL: There are kids
down there, Madam President.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.439
There's children on
every ship in the fleet.

22:37.523 --> 22:40.150
These children work
in the refinery.

22:40.568 --> 22:43.361
They're 12, 15 years old.

22:43.446 --> 22:47.032
There have been families aboard the
refinery ever since its beginning,

22:47.116 --> 22:50.785
and others were picked up after
the Cylons attacked the Colonies.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.162
Over the past two years,

22:52.246 --> 22:55.415
the parents have been teaching the
children how to operate the machinery.

22:55.499 --> 22:59.335
They have been passing along their
skills. It is perfectly normal.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.463
It is not ideal,
I know that.

23:01.839 --> 23:04.841
But there is nothing ideal
about this Fleet.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.053
Do you see what's happening?

23:08.137 --> 23:11.139
Jobs are starting to be
inherited, Madam President.

23:11.223 --> 23:14.309
We don't know how long we're gonna be
on these ships. What if it's 10 years?

23:14.393 --> 23:18.021
So, I train my son to be a deck
hand because that's what I am?

23:18.105 --> 23:20.315
And that's all
he can ever be?

23:21.734 --> 23:23.818
Is that the future we want?

23:28.032 --> 23:30.241
That's a really good point.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.622
Tory, I want you to make a
list of everyone in the Fleet

23:35.706 --> 23:38.374
who has a work history
appropriate to the refinery.

23:38.459 --> 23:41.086
Factory workers, mechanics,
whatever you think.

23:41.170 --> 23:44.297
Give it to the Chief and I want
you to hold a public lottery.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.508
And we will take people
from other vessels

23:46.592 --> 23:48.802
and we'll put them
on shifts in the refinery.

from Dogsville.

these ships and out of here

before they know
where they're going.

one over here...

Hi, I don't really know who I'm
supposed to talk to about this,

24:10.533 --> 24:13.660
but I don't really think I'm
what you guys are looking for.

24:13.744 --> 24:15.703
I don't really
have the skills.

Says you're a farmer.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.215
Farmer? Yeah,
that's what we're looking for.

24:27.258 --> 24:29.134
People to work with heavy
machinery. No, but I don't.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.301
Not really.

24:30.386 --> 24:33.346
I worked on a farm for a summer because
I was saving up to go to college.

24:33.430 --> 24:37.058
Architecture,
but then the Cylons attacked,

24:37.143 --> 24:39.394
and now I'm a farmer?
How is that fair?

24:40.729 --> 24:42.856
How is that
in any way fair?

24:45.693 --> 24:47.819
Just give me a second.

24:47.903 --> 24:51.614
We make an exception for this guy,
there's gonna be 15 more right behind him.

Look at him, though.
He's a kid.

24:56.412 --> 24:58.413
Fine. Put him on the ship.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.999
Look, this is just
a temporary thing, okay?

25:01.083 --> 25:03.418
Hey, wait, hold on.
I'm not a farmer!

25:03.502 --> 25:04.544
Yeah, it's not permanent.

No, wait, can you just
check my record? Yeah.

Excuse me. Who am I supposed
to talk to about this?

to talk to about this?

25:11.760 --> 25:13.887
You don't understand!
I'm not a farmer!

25:13.971 --> 25:16.598
Hey! Stop it!
I'm not a farmer!

25:47.630 --> 25:49.547
What are you doing here?

25:49.632 --> 25:53.343
Your book,
fact or fiction?

25:53.427 --> 25:55.386
So you read it?

25:55.471 --> 25:59.557
Well, that proves that the
President is an accomplished liar.

25:59.642 --> 26:03.728
She told me it hadn't gone
out. So what do you make of it?

26:03.812 --> 26:06.231
I think that
it's a pile of crap.

26:06.315 --> 26:10.693
Obviously, my analysis of a
bifurcated society scares you.

26:10.778 --> 26:13.696
But everything in my book
happens to be true.

26:14.657 --> 26:19.911
Oh, it's true? It's true that
you're a farm boy from Aerelon.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.246
Yes, it is,
as a matter of fact.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.623

on a dairy outside the town

on Aerelon.

hard time picturing you

and shoveling manure?

26:34.510 --> 26:36.469
Lack of imagination.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.515
Or maybe that
your little tale is manure.

26:43.143 --> 26:46.980
I've known people from Aerelon.
You don't sound anything like them.

26:47.064 --> 26:49.774
I don't sound like I'm from Aerelon? No.

26:49.858 --> 26:52.777
Well, you know I take that
as a particular compliment.

26:52.861 --> 26:55.697
I don't know about you, but I've
always found the Aerelon dialect

26:55.781 --> 26:58.283
to be particularly
hard on the ears.

26:59.034 --> 27:00.660
(IN DIFFERENT ACCENT)

27:00.744 --> 27:02.954

of the throat.

Of course, I should know an
awful lot about my native tongue.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.334
I spent hours on end
trying to overcome it.

27:08.419 --> 27:11.254
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

27:11.338 --> 27:14.841
for a 10-year-old boy
to change the way he speaks?

27:14.925 --> 27:17.552
To unlearn everything
he ever learned

27:18.220 --> 27:22.598
so that one day
there might be the small hope

27:24.935 --> 27:28.021
that he might be considered
as not coming from Aerelon?

27:28.355 --> 27:30.732
Maybe, I don't know, Caprica?

27:32.234 --> 27:35.820
Caprica?
Oh, to be Caprican.

27:38.407 --> 27:43.578
The seat of politics, culture,
art, science, learning.

27:44.121 --> 27:48.166
And what was Aerelon?
Just a drab, ugly rock,

27:48.250 --> 27:53.087
condemned to be the food
basket for the 12 worlds.

27:53.756 --> 27:58.676
And that's how we were treated, like
servants, like laborers, like working class.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.763
You know, you would have
fitted right in there, Chief.

28:01.847 --> 28:06.517
Lots of men who liked to work with their
hands and grab a pint down at the pub

28:06.602 --> 28:10.271
and finish off the evening
with a good old-fashioned fight.

28:11.690 --> 28:16.444
Oh, yes, I left Aerelon
after my 18 birthday.

28:17.946 --> 28:24.911
I turned my back on my family,
on my heritage, all of them.

28:27.081 --> 28:30.124
Of course, it doesn't matter.
They're all dead now.

28:30.876 --> 28:33.628

none of that exists here.

perfectly happy, shouldn't you?

Perfectly at ease. Go home!
Leave me in peace!

28:49.645 --> 28:51.562
After all, that's what
the aristocracy wants.

28:51.647 --> 28:54.565
It wants the working class
to feel looked after,

28:54.650 --> 28:58.152
while they scrabble around for
scraps from the master's table.

29:06.370 --> 29:07.829
There's a question I ask
at the end of my book.

29:07.913 --> 29:10.665
I'll save you the trouble
of reading it.

29:11.125 --> 29:13.418
Do you honestly believe that
the Fleet will ever be commanded

29:13.502 --> 29:16.337
by somebody whose
last name is not Adama?

There it is, Chief.

One set of rules
for the aristocracy,

29:24.555 --> 29:27.306

wasn't getting burned off.

got a half-dozen other places

The whole system will seize up!

still in the chambers will superheat

vital missions only?

Cally relayed the orders
from Chief Tyrol.

We're on strike.

Admiral.

Are you aware that your deck gang
is participating in a work stoppage?

35:26.208 --> 35:29.418
It's called a general
strike, sir. It's a mutiny.

And do you know
what we do with mutineers?

We're leaving people
behind, Admiral.

to the starboard repair bay.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.860
The repair bay?
What are you doing?

36:35.944 --> 36:40.114
I'm gonna put her up against the bulkhead
and I'm gonna shoot her as a mutineer.

your frakking mind?

36:41.992 --> 36:43.826
Cally was just
following my orders.

36:43.910 --> 36:46.704
She's a ringleader,
so she goes first.

gang, Figurski, Seelix, Pollux...

36:55.463 --> 36:57.131
You won't do this.

depend on someone getting an order

37:05.682 --> 37:07.558
that they don't want to do.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.561
And if they hesitate,

37:10.687 --> 37:14.064
if they feel that orders
are sometimes optional,

37:14.149 --> 37:16.525
then this ship will perish,

37:17.402 --> 37:22.615
and so will your son
and the entire human race.

to do this, Chief.

But I will put 10 Callys
up against the wall

this fleet are not destroyed.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.184

to the Marine.

38:36.106 --> 38:37.940
Release her.

38:45.699 --> 38:47.324
You can go now, Chief.

38:49.494 --> 38:53.497
I thought you had something that you
wanted to discuss with the President.

39:05.093 --> 39:08.220
Would you like another drink?
I think I've had enough.

39:08.930 --> 39:09.930
Madam President,

39:10.015 --> 39:14.184
I've seen people drafted into service
based purely on where they were born.

39:14.269 --> 39:17.479
They've also been selected
based on their skills.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.691
Which is a result
of where they were born.

39:20.984 --> 39:23.193
Capricans are more likely
to be professionals.

39:23.278 --> 39:24.862
Aerelons are more
likely to be farmers.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.363
It's just a fact of life.

39:26.448 --> 39:27.948
It's a fact
I can't change.

39:28.033 --> 39:32.119
True. But I think we can
level the playing field.

39:32.203 --> 39:36.290
There are a lot of dirty jobs that
need to be done every day in this fleet,

39:36.374 --> 39:39.835
cleaning, hauling, low-level
maintenance, things like that.

39:39.919 --> 39:43.839
These are the kind of jobs that I
think should be allocated to people,

39:47.802 --> 39:50.471
well, people like yourself.
No offense.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.058
None taken. Go ahead.

39:55.393 --> 39:59.897
Let some of the people on Colonial
One get their hands dirty for a change.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.857
Done. What else?

40:01.941 --> 40:04.568
People that are in dangerous
and high stress jobs

40:04.652 --> 40:06.361
need to be rotated
out for R and R.

40:06.446 --> 40:09.907
Now, in order to do that, we
need a formal training program.

40:09.991 --> 40:14.161
We can talk about a training program
later, but right now I need to focus

40:14.245 --> 40:16.580
on maintaining the work force
that we have,

40:16.664 --> 40:20.250
and this is gonna have to be an
area where the union gives ground.

40:21.294 --> 40:22.711
The union?

40:22.796 --> 40:25.547
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were
engaged in collective bargaining

40:25.632 --> 40:28.550
on behalf of the
Colonial Workers' Alliance.

40:28.676 --> 40:31.512
If that's not the case,
then... Madam President,

40:31.596 --> 40:33.889
that union died
on New Caprica.

40:34.599 --> 40:36.767
Chief, the workers in this
fleet, they need someone

40:36.851 --> 40:39.186
to represent them
and their interests.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.980
And if this society
is becoming truly polarized

40:42.065 --> 40:46.026
between an entrenched political class
and a disenfranchised underclass,

40:46.111 --> 40:47.736
we are doomed.

40:47.821 --> 40:51.365
We won't need the Cylons to
destroy us, we'll destroy ourselves.

40:51.449 --> 40:56.203
The fleet that arrives at Earth will
not represent Colonial society at all.

40:57.080 --> 41:00.707
I am willing to fight for that
society until my dying breath.

41:00.792 --> 41:03.836
I would love it if you would
fight for that society as well.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.045
Hmm.

41:07.257 --> 41:08.465
I will.

41:10.677 --> 41:13.011
I will, Madam President.
I will.

41:20.436 --> 41:25.023
TYROL: Pollux and Herschel,
you are on fueling 4372.

41:25.108 --> 41:26.942
STARBUCK: Chief Tyrol.

41:27.026 --> 41:28.068
Hey, Captain.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.653
Chief, one of my nuggets
failed to show up

41:29.737 --> 41:31.655
for basic flight
instruction this morning.

41:31.739 --> 41:32.781
Sorry to hear that, Captain.

41:32.866 --> 41:35.993
So maybe you can tell me
where the hell Diana Seelix is?

41:36.077 --> 41:37.911
Seelix.
Front and center.

41:43.042 --> 41:45.377
Flight instruction began
20 minutes ago, Seelix.

41:45.461 --> 41:47.337
You want to be
a pilot or not?

41:47.422 --> 41:48.463
Yes, sir,
but I thought that...

41:48.548 --> 41:51.133
You will think when I
tell you to think, nugget.

41:51.217 --> 41:53.343
And you might want to look
at the plan of the day.

41:53.428 --> 41:55.512
Because then, maybe you'll
know where you're supposed to be

41:55.597 --> 41:58.098
and you might actually
get there on time.

41:59.976 --> 42:02.144
And you're out of uniform,
to boot.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.479
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain.
I think I can handle that.

42:04.564 --> 42:06.440
Thank you, Chief.
Hold this.

42:11.946 --> 42:16.074
You have to be
an officer to fly Vipers.

42:17.785 --> 42:19.286
You know that.

42:21.456 --> 42:23.790
Detail. Hand-salute!

42:32.383 --> 42:35.260
Thank you, Chief. Thank you.

42:37.764 --> 42:38.764
Congratulations, Ensign.

42:38.848 --> 42:41.308
All right, this is all very
touching, but you were supposed to be

42:41.392 --> 42:43.727
in Ready Room Four
20 minutes ago, Ensign,

42:43.811 --> 42:47.731
which means that you are
falling behind on your first day.

42:48.524 --> 42:50.108
So move it.

42:50.193 --> 42:53.654
Don't look at him!
Move it! Move it!

42:56.074 --> 42:57.324
Be nice.
