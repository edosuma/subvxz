<i>To make more cash, sacred heart
 had started catering to rich folk,</i>

00:05.389 --> 00:07.670
<i>Hence the swanky new suites.</i>

00:07.895 --> 00:09.721
Turn down service, mr. worthington?

00:09.722 --> 00:10.769
Oh, not now.

00:10.770 --> 00:11.976
When's a good time?

00:11.977 --> 00:13.839
Never. He's in a coma.

00:14.792 --> 00:17.404
<i> Not only were the new suites
super expensive,</i>

00:17.405 --> 00:20.452
<i>they were absolutely ruing my figure.</i>

00:23.567 --> 00:26.002
Turk and carla had just
brought their new baby home.

00:26.003 --> 00:27.245
What's up, isabella?

00:27.246 --> 00:31.947
For your 16th birthday,
your dad has made you a videotape.

00:38.253 --> 00:40.147
Now, i know future me is probably
really strict,

00:40.223 --> 00:42.200
so no dating, no make-up,

00:42.293 --> 00:44.653
and no spending spring break
with your friends on mars.

00:44.828 --> 00:46.689
Last thing i need to worry about
is my daughter

00:46.778 --> 00:48.772
 getting eaten by a giant space slug.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.264
Know what i'm sayin'?

00:51.000 --> 00:51.628
Anyway,

00:51.629 --> 00:54.755
 for your 16th birthday,
my gift to you is to show you

00:54.756 --> 00:57.188
how happy your mom was the day we brought you home.

00:58.580 --> 00:59.334
Baby?

01:01.469 --> 01:03.664
I can't do this.

01:04.916 --> 01:06.549
We have to take her back.

01:08.731 --> 01:10.894
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

01:10.895 --> 01:12.311
We'll talk later.

01:12.312 --> 01:14.886
<i>As for me, my pregnant girlfriend
just moved away,</i>

01:14.887 --> 01:16.863
<i>but I was still keeping things spicy.</i>

01:16.980 --> 01:18.482
Oh, of course I miss you, baby!

01:18.523 --> 01:20.201
Want to see a picture of me missing you?

01:20.320 --> 01:20.875
Hold on.

01:24.562 --> 01:25.414
Oh, thanks.

01:25.768 --> 01:28.173
Do you want to see a picture
of my rock-hard abs?

01:29.276 --> 01:30.464
Ok, hold on.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.235
No, no, I've always had an innie.

01:39.413 --> 01:41.416
She wants to see a picture of my ass.

01:41.593 --> 01:43.933
- Oh, J.D., I don't want...
- I am your superior!

01:47.055 --> 01:48.131
what the--?

01:48.681 --> 01:51.325
Oh, hey, elliot, I'll have him back to you
in one second.

01:51.780 --> 01:55.044
Kim, yeah, those pictures are of keith, ok?
Read 'em and weep.

01:55.045 --> 01:56.808
Look, J.D. will call you back later.

01:57.345 --> 02:00.797
Keith! why do you keep letting people take pictures of your body?

02:00.798 --> 02:03.636
I mean, this is exactly like that night
I caught you in the bathroom at the bus station.

02:03.717 --> 02:05.380
Come on, this is nothing like that.

02:09.109 --> 02:10.532
What the hell are you doing?

02:11.289 --> 02:13.705
Oh, hey, elliot. I'll have him back
to you in one second.

02:14.323 --> 02:16.523
Gettin' a little flare off the urinal.

02:17.715 --> 02:19.870
Actually, keith, it's a little like that.

02:20.000 --> 02:20.653
Little bit.

02:21.132 --> 02:22.653
one areola shot, real quick.

<i>Now that elliot was private practice,
there were tons of perks.</i>

02:41.209 --> 02:44.010
<i>For one, dr. kelso still refused
to speak to her.</i>

02:44.286 --> 02:45.157
Hey, Dr. kelso.

02:46.019 --> 02:48.352
Oh, if you're a doody face,
don't say anything.

02:50.683 --> 02:52.334
Get used to that joke, people.

02:52.335 --> 02:55.664
Because I'm going to be doing it all the time.

02:56.211 --> 02:58.466
Still, the biggest perk is that at 5:00,
she gets

02:58.467 --> 03:01.463
to dump  her patients on someone else 
and go home.

03:01.607 --> 03:04.690
Mr. sandal has hocum. I'm not using
disopyramide,

03:04.810 --> 03:06.482
so just continue treating with beta blockers.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.423
You're giving orders to me?

03:09.548 --> 03:11.051
OMG, barboo,

03:11.119 --> 03:12.613
you make me want to LOL

03:14.212 --> 03:16.816
I just discovered text messaging.

03:16.896 --> 03:18.888
I know i'm a little late to the game,

03:18.889 --> 03:25.672

Well, i'm just a little bit late
for my brow wax

03:33.730 --> 03:34.810
and my facial, so

03:34.834 --> 03:37.638
I'm just gonna stick these orders
to your lab coat

03:37.639 --> 03:38.888
so you don't forget them.

 of burly old russian

03:44.164 --> 03:46.317
Fine, I don't want to go home, anyway.

03:46.521 --> 03:50.185
He said in a sarcastic tone
we've all come to know as "Coxsian."

03:50.914 --> 03:51.853
I mean it.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.205
I don't want to go home. Ever since jordan

03:54.322 --> 03:57.076
entered her third trimester,
she has become a needy, bloated behemoth

03:57.201 --> 03:59.963
with a temper as big as her tree trunk-size cankles,

04:00.091 --> 04:02.678
and besides, even if I did go home, 
she'd probably just send me out on a food run

04:02.795 --> 04:05.023
To satiate one of her insane cravings.

04:08.604 --> 04:10.699
Honey, I brought you some dinner.

04:11.965 --> 04:13.341
Come here, little goaty goaty!

04:20.289 --> 04:23.403
- I wasn't finished!
- You're finished.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.420
Honey, post partum depression's really serious.

04:30.421 --> 04:32.887
True, but there are different levels.

04:32.888 --> 04:35.772
Yes, some women leave their babies
in the woods,

04:35.773 --> 04:37.925
but some women just get the weepies.

04:38.740 --> 04:41.844
- And it's just the weepies?
- Just the weepies baby.

04:43.615 --> 04:46.131
Hi! Since you're african american,

04:46.191 --> 04:49.104
I was wondering if I can borrow
some of your marvin gaye cds?

04:49.423 --> 04:51.117
Sure. Come on in, kid.

04:51.927 --> 04:53.429
Here you go.

04:53.864 --> 04:57.622
Thanks! Mazel tov on the baby.

04:57.837 --> 04:59.965
How did he know I had a baby?

05:06.643 --> 05:07.631
oh! great!

05:07.632 --> 05:11.075
I milked through my last clean t-shirt!

05:11.208 --> 05:13.161
Baby, we should really get some help.

05:13.375 --> 05:16.632
No! I've been a nurse for 15 years!

05:16.633 --> 05:19.532
What are they gonna tell us that we don't
already know?

05:19.729 --> 05:24.204
- Now, now, who are we?
- We're the turks.

05:24.205 --> 05:27.405
- And can the turks can get through this?
- Woman, the turks can handle anything.

05:27.406 --> 05:29.075
- Ok!
- Ok, now give me a hug!

05:29.212 --> 05:31.749
- Ok!
- Wait, you know what? Could you change first?

05:31.824 --> 05:34.722
'cause I don't want to get any booby juice
on my new t-shirt.

05:39.543 --> 05:43.217
<i>To me, the best thing about elliot
is all her extra cash.</i>

05:43.306 --> 05:45.152
Hey, roomie! I went shopping.

05:46.161 --> 05:48.317
Oh, this couch reminded me of my grandpa.

05:48.318 --> 05:51.031
He used to drive around in a car just like it.

05:51.032 --> 05:53.979
You know, until he was killed in that 7-car pile-up.

05:54.316 --> 05:56.941
"7- car pile-up" would be a good name 
for a rock band.

05:57.294 --> 06:00.793
Yeah, you actually told me that
on the day that he died.

06:01.626 --> 06:05.019
Anywho, I was thinking maybe we should put in 
some new hardwood floors.

06:05.414 --> 06:06.886
Why stop at hardwood?

06:09.076 --> 06:11.155
Yay, the new floors are in!

06:15.342 --> 06:20.000
Careful. trampoline floors take some gettin' used to.

06:21.709 --> 06:23.462
But I love 'em.

06:24.215 --> 06:27.265
I like bouncing, but it is dangerous.

06:27.564 --> 06:29.768
I don't care if you don't like green.

06:29.769 --> 06:31.044
Jello is jello.

06:31.045 --> 06:35.156
Laverne, if I accidentally 
backed my car over barbie,

06:35.157 --> 06:38.432
for sticking me with the world
most annoying patient,

06:38.433 --> 06:41.493
What do you think your boy jesus would do?

06:41.494 --> 06:42.867
Your wife is on the phone.

06:43.079 --> 06:45.099
He is not a merciful god, is he?

06:45.695 --> 06:47.013
Just tell her I'm still working,

06:47.163 --> 06:49.002
I have no idea what time I'm going to get off,

06:49.035 --> 06:51.013
And just go ahead and eat the entire mattress.

06:51.214 --> 06:53.000
I mean, for the love of god!

06:53.311 --> 06:57.326
I spend the entire day with patient
and the entire night with her.

06:57.388 --> 06:58.774
I need a hide-out.

06:59.322 --> 07:00.038
You're telling me.

07:00.124 --> 07:01.308
I've got this new land lady,

07:01.408 --> 07:03.104
oozy old broad,
keeps showing up at my door

07:03.204 --> 07:05.246
in an open robe and a bottle of gin.

07:05.348 --> 07:06.717
I don't want to go home.

07:06.809 --> 07:09.300
Can you tell Dr. kelso that Mr.worthington's family

07:09.391 --> 07:11.833
transferred him from the luxury suite 
to a hospice, please?

07:15.110 --> 07:18.023
oh! my god, this is beautiful.

07:18.224 --> 07:21.583
Gentlemen, how is Mr. worthington doing?

07:22.550 --> 07:24.220
He, uh, he's in a coma, bob.

07:24.663 --> 07:28.264
Great! the man has the health insurance
of a tahitian prince.

07:38.374 --> 07:40.276
Well, I gotta tell you, this is heaven.

07:40.811 --> 07:42.649
This gourmet trail mix is fantastic.

07:42.650 --> 07:47.297
I'm tastin' vanilla, cranberry...a hint of pine.

07:47.681 --> 07:49.192
That's potpourri, genius.

07:50.401 --> 07:51.568
Is that hickory?

07:52.870 --> 07:55.281
You should see all
the sweet new toys elliot bought.

07:55.474 --> 07:56.339
It's awesome.

07:56.838 --> 07:59.532
It's like that time in college
when we got to split all of chugski's stuff

07:59.635 --> 08:01.160
when he drank himself to death.

08:01.302 --> 08:03.454
I miss you, you crazy polish bastard!

08:03.889 --> 08:05.557
Pour some out for one's homies.

08:08.921 --> 08:10.704
So, how are things at the homestead?

08:10.705 --> 08:12.587
Ah, no worries.

08:13.356 --> 08:17.035
I can't feed my own baby!

08:19.068 --> 08:21.457
See, baby, the great thing
about workg at a hospital

08:21.458 --> 08:24.536
is that we have access
to all types of medical care.

08:24.811 --> 08:26.338
Having trouble feeding your baby?

08:26.551 --> 08:29.182
Bam, say hello to your lactation specialists.

08:29.630 --> 08:31.621
Try tickling her lip with the nipple

08:31.690 --> 08:33.333
to let her know it's time to eat.

08:33.418 --> 08:35.813
Then just use your breast 
to lower her bottom lip.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.202
I can't see the nipple.

08:37.937 --> 08:39.595
Todd, get the hell out of here.

08:46.517 --> 08:47.778
It's freezing in here.

08:47.779 --> 08:49.552
Put on a pair of pants,
you'd be fine.

08:49.787 --> 08:52.465
Hey, in my house,
it's no pants, no problem.

08:52.685 --> 08:54.086
I'm putting in a videotape.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.252
Now, what the hell is this?

08:59.253 --> 09:00.568
It's a security camera tape.

09:00.809 --> 09:02.111
I like to count the times

09:02.186 --> 09:04.281
that colonel doctor goes to the bathroom
during the day,

09:04.339 --> 09:06.626
then freak him out
by guessing the exact number.

09:06.769 --> 09:08.253
And there's one...

09:08.990 --> 09:10.199
- Hey!
- Look, this--this

09:10.200 --> 09:11.990
clearly isn't working out.

09:11.991 --> 09:13.897
Well, I found this room,

09:13.898 --> 09:15.211
so you should go.

09:17.277 --> 09:19.732
Now, that's just about enough, shrek.

09:22.642 --> 09:23.719
What?

09:24.251 --> 09:27.044
I specifically told you
not to give mr. sandal disopyramide.

09:27.111 --> 09:28.772
Why would you change my orders?

09:28.773 --> 09:30.533
Well, there were 2 treatment options,

09:30.597 --> 09:33.699
and when in doubt, I always go
in the opposite direction of you.

09:34.917 --> 09:38.046
- Don't do it again.
- So, do it again?

09:39.393 --> 09:40.550
Look, barbie,

09:40.779 --> 09:43.874
What you're missing here
is that you're private practice now.

09:43.964 --> 09:46.359
That means you're the enemy.
and I know, as a doctor,

09:46.500 --> 09:48.949
disease is supposed to be the enemy,

09:49.016 --> 09:51.040
but I'm giving hepatitis and his bantam

09:51.180 --> 09:53.984
infectious buddies a pass, 
and I'm coming after you today.

09:54.034 --> 09:56.744
The bottom line is you'd rather
clock out of here early

09:56.745 --> 09:58.360
than run the extra mile
for your patients, and, barbie,

09:58.361 --> 10:00.661
that makes you a sell-out.

10:04.835 --> 10:09.381
Ah, you went 14 times total--
4 false alarms and one emergency.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.458
Uncanny.

10:12.892 --> 10:13.819
I'm exhausted.

10:14.769 --> 10:15.946
Pick me up a latte.

10:17.981 --> 10:20.599
She's still not eating.
None of this stuff is working.

10:20.666 --> 10:23.699
We're the turks, remember?
Now, if you ask me,

10:23.700 --> 10:28.227
isabella is placing calls, 
but no one's responding in the areola code.

10:28.308 --> 10:29.155
What?

10:29.156 --> 10:31.146
Those 2 little turkey timers
you got there

10:31.147 --> 10:33.000
are telling me 
that that birdie's not done.

10:33.609 --> 10:37.059
And this place is too public
for me to arouse them freaky-deeky style-y,

10:37.060 --> 10:39.354
So, i'm gonna have to go
an alternate route.

10:40.699 --> 10:45.063
your dead mama had one of the
 fattest asses I've ever seen!

10:45.064 --> 10:45.752
what?!

10:47.229 --> 10:48.514
Turkey's done.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.493
She's latching.

10:52.967 --> 10:54.465
Dr. cox is such a jerk.

10:54.466 --> 10:57.667
I'm so sick of hearing him get all righteous
about private practice doctors.

10:57.668 --> 11:01.392
We're the turks! what, We're the turks!
We're the turks, what?! We're the turks!

11:01.393 --> 11:03.324
- We're the turks, what?!
- You're the turks!

11:03.325 --> 11:06.200
That's right, we're the turks!

11:06.322 --> 11:06.881
I mean, seriously,

11:07.113 --> 11:09.621
since when does working at a hospital
suddenly make you a better person?

11:09.622 --> 11:11.025
It's such a load of crap.

11:11.147 --> 11:12.600
I don't know if it's really a load of crap.

11:12.602 --> 11:14.140
it's just that,  well, if you--

11:14.141 --> 11:16.998
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
could you say that a little bit louder?

11:16.999 --> 11:19.694
I just thought, you know, money, 
like a sell-out, so--

11:19.695 --> 11:22.161
Wait, do you actually
agree with dr. cox?

11:22.162 --> 11:25.420
<i>It doesn't take too much 
to send 2 people down a bad road.</i>

11:26.158 --> 11:27.718
<i>it could be a few simple words...</i>

11:27.719 --> 11:29.007
I guess I do.

11:30.711 --> 11:32.455
<i>or even just a little surprise waiting at home.</i>

11:33.455 --> 11:37.066
We're the turks, what?! we're the turks!
we're the turks, what--

11:38.926 --> 11:41.251
Why are you watching my baby,
and where's my wife?

11:41.483 --> 11:43.331
She said she'd be back later.

11:49.946 --> 11:52.222
J.D., have you seen carla?

11:52.223 --> 11:55.377
- Sorry, brown bear.
Hey, mocha cup.

11:55.922 --> 11:57.499
Carla just called 

11:57.666 --> 11:59.444
to tell you nothing fit, 
so she went to the mall.

11:59.861 --> 12:00.630
Watch her.

12:01.794 --> 12:04.931
 ooh, hey, chuckles! If you're a doody face,
just keep walking.

12:06.004 --> 12:08.157
Get funnier every time, people.

12:08.660 --> 12:10.297
- Hey, J.D.
- Hey, elliot,

12:10.298 --> 12:12.672
 look, I know you're probably mad
about what I said yesterday, and--

12:12.673 --> 12:15.599
I'm not mad. Well,
I mean, at first I was a little mad

12:15.600 --> 12:17.488
so I started power walking
down fourth avenue.

12:17.489 --> 12:20.620
Right when I got to that place
where it starts to get a little ghetto,

12:20.621 --> 12:22.687
I realized, you're just jealous.

12:22.809 --> 12:25.094
I am not jealous.

12:25.103 --> 12:26.821
oh, please, J.D., I know you. 
Whenever you're jealous, 

12:26.822 --> 12:29.405
you run your hands through your hair 
and then you smell them.

12:30.380 --> 12:31.264
I do not!

12:31.489 --> 12:33.600
<i>Ok, resist smelling</i>

12:33.601 --> 12:35.941
<i>That coconut goodness
that caresses your tresses!</i>

12:36.069 --> 12:37.153
<i>Don't do it!</i>

12:38.042 --> 12:38.714
Whatever.

12:43.665 --> 12:45.081
Ahh, pina colada!

12:47.375 --> 12:50.022
I think these would
go great with that shirt.

12:50.023 --> 12:51.212
Why don't you go try them on?

12:52.649 --> 12:54.231
Why were you just helping that guy?

12:54.232 --> 12:57.000
These pants and the shirt are the only things
 I have left that fit me,

12:57.001 --> 12:59.143
and everyone keeps
mistaking me for an employee.

12:59.144 --> 13:02.127
Anyway, I was helping phil
with his whole new denim look.

13:02.128 --> 13:04.538
- Hey, could you also get me--
- Go away, phil.

13:04.539 --> 13:06.262
Baby, let's go see the doctor.

13:06.627 --> 13:07.273
No,

13:07.512 --> 13:09.279
 I'm not gonna have people laugh at me 

13:09.280 --> 13:10.796
because I can't care for my own child.

13:10.797 --> 13:14.099
No doctors, not now, not ever.
Understand?

13:14.100 --> 13:15.849
 We're the turks!

13:21.666 --> 13:23.086
Put that down.

13:23.337 --> 13:25.657
Elliot said that until
you admit you're jealous,

13:25.658 --> 13:27.084
You can't use any of her things.

13:27.085 --> 13:29.985
Well, elliot's not here, keith.
what are you gonna do about it?

13:31.601 --> 13:34.316
Nice singlet.
Does it come in hetero?

13:34.930 --> 13:36.135
Do not turn on that tv.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.266
He wrestled you, didn't he?

13:51.267 --> 13:53.508
See, keith got his old high school uniform

13:53.509 --> 13:55.749
so that he actually incorporated it
 into our love play.

13:55.750 --> 13:58.582
I'm the lesbian coach
and he's the captain of the wrestling team,

13:58.583 --> 14:00.026
and he turns me--

14:00.973 --> 14:03.769
So, have you decided to admit
 that you're jealous?

14:03.770 --> 14:06.182
No, never, ok? And thanks a lot,

14:06.183 --> 14:08.394
because the one hour that kim and I had
to actually talk,

14:08.395 --> 14:10.608
I was stuckin your stupid
 boyfriend's scissor-hold.

14:11.462 --> 14:14.586
Oh, don't you just love the way his thighs
feel against your ears?

14:15.050 --> 14:17.192
No, not particularly.

14:23.757 --> 14:26.109
- Dr. cox, I need your help.
- Not now, ghandi.

14:26.450 --> 14:30.098
darn it all, I-- I could have sworn
there was a room right here--

14:32.901 --> 14:34.311
Do you hear something?

14:46.031 --> 14:49.066
Look, carla's going all post partum
depression-y on me,

14:49.067 --> 14:50.990
And she won't let me to take her to see a doctor.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.317
She's never gonna listen to you.

14:52.955 --> 14:54.357
You're a guy.

14:54.734 --> 14:56.582
You have no idea what she's going through.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.806
The fact is, the only person
she will listen to

14:58.807 --> 15:01.032
is someone who's gone
through it themselves.

15:01.281 --> 15:02.865
Fine. who?

15:03.400 --> 15:05.580
I cannot believe I am doing this.

15:26.209 --> 15:28.817
- I'm scared.
- Me, too, ghandi.

15:34.318 --> 15:35.318
What!?

15:35.840 --> 15:38.322
- You look pretty, dear.
- So pretty.

15:42.189 --> 15:43.808
Keikers?

15:45.178 --> 15:46.633
Nuts.

15:50.593 --> 15:51.473
Hi, J.D.

15:53.090 --> 15:55.493
Relax, I'm at the hospital.
This is just a webcam.

15:55.754 --> 15:58.063
What's the matter? Your aryan boyfriend 
had to go to a rally,

15:58.064 --> 15:59.481
so now you have to watch me?

15:59.482 --> 16:01.762
Look, you don't have
to admit that you're jealous.

16:01.763 --> 16:03.016
I was thinking,

16:03.017 --> 16:06.082
Kim's not around, and I can't even imagine
how much that sucks,

16:06.083 --> 16:08.467
 so, I sent her a webcam just like this one,

16:08.468 --> 16:10.153
and you guys can video chat whenever you want.

16:10.154 --> 16:12.101
Anything to make the long distance easier, right?

16:12.445 --> 16:15.388
Anyway, I hope you like it.
See you.

16:21.370 --> 16:23.112
I love the interhighway.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.671
I've been expecting you.

16:47.112 --> 16:48.422
You know, jumpsuit,

16:48.806 --> 16:51.713
As I was scaling the hospital,
I had an epiphany.

16:52.106 --> 16:54.654
This back-and-forth between you and I

16:54.994 --> 16:56.573
is just gonna get worse and worse.

16:56.574 --> 16:59.390
I mean, the only thing
I could think about was retaliation,

16:59.391 --> 17:03.888
And I'm relatively certain that you've got a
 couple of tricks up your sleeve, too.

17:04.393 --> 17:06.310
I do have a friend.
He works on wall street.

17:06.311 --> 17:08.482
He and I got a good look 
at your personal finances,

17:08.577 --> 17:11.047
and he agreed to fly into town
and bash your head in.

17:11.983 --> 17:14.689
Right. that would roughly be
what I'm referring to.

17:15.537 --> 17:19.108
- Ahh. then, yes.
 - There really is only one way to end this.

17:19.108 --> 17:21.890
We each ingest a cyanide capsule. 
On 3--

17:21.891 --> 17:23.676
One, 2, 3.

17:23.678 --> 17:26.449
- No. What are you doing?
- Mine's a skittle.

17:26.637 --> 17:28.351
- Mine, too?
- Sure.

17:29.211 --> 17:30.369
Get out of here.

17:31.171 --> 17:35.098
Look, there really is only one way to end this
so that we both come out alive.

17:36.152 --> 17:37.475
We've got to page him.

17:57.115 --> 17:58.124
You.

17:58.977 --> 18:00.908
Get the hell out of here
before I charge you

18:00.909 --> 18:03.447
 for every cashew you've pilfred
from the mini-bar.

18:03.869 --> 18:05.034
And you,

18:05.372 --> 18:08.782
Stop eating the potpourri
and get back to work.

18:13.808 --> 18:17.743
- So you have post-partum depression.
- No. I have the weepies.

18:17.744 --> 18:20.101
- No, baby,you've got post--
- You have no lines in this play.

18:22.011 --> 18:23.775
Jordan, I can handle it.

18:23.776 --> 18:25.444
Really? What you got there
in your hand?

18:25.960 --> 18:28.167
A job application for the gap.

18:29.321 --> 18:30.891
Oh, that's a good career move.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.087
Look...

18:33.857 --> 18:37.064
All I ever wanted was to be a mother,

18:37.065 --> 18:41.115
And now that I am one,
I feel like I'm not cut out for it.

18:41.116 --> 18:42.318
And you're ashamed of that?

18:42.855 --> 18:44.648
Well, wouldn't you be?

18:45.064 --> 18:46.860
Yeah. I was.

18:47.951 --> 18:50.610
What's the worst feeling
you've had since you had the baby?

18:51.883 --> 18:52.829
I don't know.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.273
When jack wouldn't stop crying,

18:54.274 --> 18:55.835
I wanted to throw that bastard
out the window.

18:56.131 --> 18:57.293
Really?

18:57.976 --> 19:00.730
I wanted to throw isabella
out the window.

19:01.416 --> 19:03.961
But we just had our apartment repainted,

19:03.962 --> 19:06.002
and all the windows were sealed shut,

19:06.199 --> 19:09.201
so I just wanted to drop her off the roof.

19:09.202 --> 19:11.629
- Oh, my god!
- Listen,

19:11.729 --> 19:13.414
 you can't get rid this

19:13.465 --> 19:16.009
by sheer force of will or positive thinking

19:16.160 --> 19:20.307
 or taking advice from a big hollywood movie star
and the dead science fiction writer he worships.

19:23.217 --> 19:24.619
You need to get some help.

19:28.242 --> 19:29.152
That's what I've been try--

19:29.153 --> 19:31.552
If you talk again,
I'm going to eat you.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.200
Hey, everybody.

19:39.397 --> 19:40.518
You hear her, newbie.

19:40.519 --> 19:43.347
Private practice barbie is clocking out.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.093
Now, if we could just get cancer
 to go home at 5:00, we'd be all set.

19:46.094 --> 19:47.802
Come on. You're just jealous.

19:49.791 --> 19:50.654
I know I am.

19:50.655 --> 19:54.053
<i>The first step of solving any problem
is admitting that you have one.</i>

19:55.243 --> 19:59.156
<i>After that, you can start to work 
on feeling like your old self again.</i>

19:59.972 --> 20:03.088
All right, izzie. this is what
your mom looks like on anti-depressants.

20:03.857 --> 20:06.237
- Oh, we're sharing secrets now?
- Yeah.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.088
Oh, 'cause izzie, look,

20:08.089 --> 20:09.388
this is what your daddy looks like

20:09.389 --> 20:11.163
the last time he tried to grow out his hair.

20:11.322 --> 20:12.684
How sad.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.217
That's cold, baby.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.040
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:29.641 --> 20:31.772
That is so not why I bought you that.

20:31.773 --> 20:35.099
Elliot, relax.
We heard you coming.

20:35.774 --> 20:39.266
Whatever. Kim, your boobies look great up there.

20:41.199 --> 20:44.646
- I didn't hear her coming.
- Me neither.

20:44.987 --> 20:46.438
All right, now get back in there, stud.

20:47.005 --> 20:48.242
In a sec.

20:49.401 --> 20:51.033
I really miss you.

20:53.443 --> 20:55.192
Yeah, I miss you too.
