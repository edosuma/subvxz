WEBVTT

00:27.094 --> 00:28.327
Can I help you?

00:28.428 --> 00:30.263
Oh, Hi, there. [chuckles]

00:30.263 --> 00:31.532
Where did you come from?

00:31.632 --> 00:34.067
I'm just waiting
for the museum to open.

00:34.167 --> 00:35.502
Just a normal shark

00:35.502 --> 00:37.170
doing normal shark things.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.805
-Don't... Don't worry about me.
-[alarm blaring]

00:38.805 --> 00:40.740
We got 'em! It's go time.

00:40.740 --> 00:42.241
Halt! Thieves.

00:42.341 --> 00:44.578
[dramatic music playing]

00:44.677 --> 00:46.079
Aquaman?

00:46.079 --> 00:50.484
Yes, noble guard.
It is I, The Aquaman,

00:50.584 --> 00:53.387
protector of the deep blue
and all its inhabitants.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.655
It is an honor.

00:54.755 --> 00:58.124
I will apprehend
these air breathers.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.793
You give chase
to their co-conspirators.

01:00.895 --> 01:02.429
[Atlantean guard]
Yes, my liege.

01:04.463 --> 01:05.733
[laughing cunningly]

01:06.900 --> 01:08.436
[Dr. Psycho humming]

01:12.506 --> 01:16.475
-[intense music playing]
-[laughing maniacally]

01:16.477 --> 01:17.778
All right,
let's get outta here--

01:17.778 --> 01:18.778
Ow!

01:20.546 --> 01:22.649
I spoil your little party?

01:22.750 --> 01:26.152
Ha-ha! It is I, Aquaman,

01:26.253 --> 01:29.489
son of Atlan,
heir to the throne of Atlantis.

01:29.489 --> 01:30.489
[groans]

01:30.557 --> 01:31.792
I must say, King Shark,

01:31.792 --> 01:33.626
your mother
would be most displeased

01:33.626 --> 01:35.629
to find you
in this plebeian company.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.897
You're not my dad!

01:36.996 --> 01:39.198
That is contrary
to what she said.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.134
-Ah-ha-hoy!
-[dolphin squeaking]

01:41.233 --> 01:42.736
Let us now dispense
with the levity.

01:42.835 --> 01:45.237
I am going to need
the Atlantean jewels

01:45.237 --> 01:46.540
with which you absconded.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.608
Bravo!

01:47.608 --> 01:49.376
What magnificent word choice.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.778
You are truly
the Shakespeare of the sea.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.546
I prefer to think of myself

01:53.546 --> 01:55.248
as the Dickens of the Deep.

01:56.215 --> 01:57.551
Hey. Deep Dickens.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.319
Let's wrap up
this episode of <i>Frasier</i>

01:59.319 --> 02:01.388
so we can get back to getting
the hell out of here.

02:01.388 --> 02:02.822
-[dolphin squeaks]
-[Aquaman laughs]

02:02.822 --> 02:05.793
She certainly is that.
[snooty laugh]

02:05.793 --> 02:07.293
What did that dolphin
say about me?

02:07.293 --> 02:08.762
Oh, I don't speak dolphin.

02:08.861 --> 02:11.598
I know a little porpoise,
but--

02:11.698 --> 02:14.668
What villainous reject
have you deigned to summon?

02:16.368 --> 02:17.704
[dramatic music playing]

02:17.805 --> 02:18.806
[pained squeak]

02:22.008 --> 02:24.777
Did somebody call for... kelp?

02:26.879 --> 02:28.281
[Aquaman groans]

02:28.381 --> 02:30.850
Unkelp me, plant witch.

02:30.850 --> 02:31.850
Let's go.

02:33.286 --> 02:35.656
Yes. Run. Run!

02:35.656 --> 02:38.792
I, Aquaman, will retrieve
my family's jewels,

02:38.891 --> 02:42.695
-and the sirens will sing
of my revenge for eterni--
-[ship horn blares]

02:42.695 --> 02:45.699
Ow... Juba? A little help?

02:45.699 --> 02:46.733
[squeaks]

02:46.733 --> 02:48.467
[sighs]

02:48.467 --> 02:50.402
Harley Quinn and her crew made
<i>Aquaman look like a member</i>

02:50.402 --> 02:52.838
<i>of the Justice B League</i>
<i>this afternoon,</i>

02:52.840 --> 02:55.776
<i>and made off with a set</i>
<i>of ancient Atlantean jewels.</i>

02:55.776 --> 02:58.510
<i>The standout of the crew</i>
<i>was Poison Ivy...</i>

02:58.512 --> 02:59.979
[sighs]
I'm so sick of hearing this.

02:59.979 --> 03:01.979
Um, I am not part of the crew.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.717
I was asked for a favor.
I provided said favor.

03:04.818 --> 03:05.853
End of story.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.520
Holy shit!
Guys, guys, listen.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.788
"Dear Ms. Quinn,

03:08.889 --> 03:10.723
based on your recent
evil efforts,

03:10.723 --> 03:13.360
the Legion of Doom
invites you and your crew

03:13.460 --> 03:17.396
to our headquarters to discuss
further possibilities."

03:17.396 --> 03:18.396
[squeals]

03:18.431 --> 03:20.400
[theme music playing]

03:22.400 --> 03:23.804
Guys, this is what
we've been workin' towards.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.271
Dump Joker, check.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.007
Get noticed by
the Legion of Doom, check.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.542
Oh! I did it!

03:28.542 --> 03:30.544
Even though no one said
I could run a crew.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.778
What? Hello. Hi.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.080
I said that you
could run a crew.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.548
Yeah, but you're my friend.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.782
Uh, come on,
it's like when your mom says

03:35.883 --> 03:37.050
you're the prettiest girl
in school.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.621
[gasps]
That's what my mom said.

03:40.721 --> 03:44.858
Shark genitalia is very hard
to see. Until it isn't.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.492
This is huge for us.

03:46.592 --> 03:48.795
Means we might get
to move out of this shithole.

03:48.895 --> 03:52.299
I will have you know,
Norm Dilfer,

03:52.399 --> 03:54.501
the Carpet King of Gotham

03:54.600 --> 03:57.638
found this mall
more than satisfactory.

03:57.737 --> 04:00.841
[Tentacle Monster growling]

04:00.941 --> 04:02.675
What the heck is that noise?

04:02.776 --> 04:04.478
Oh yeah, that shit's
been keepin' me up.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.145
I haven't been able to get
a lick of sleep for days.

04:06.146 --> 04:08.314
I... I didn't hear any noise.

04:08.314 --> 04:11.784
And you can count me out of
this Legion of Doom business.

04:11.884 --> 04:13.687
Hey Harley, since I've been
banned for life,

04:13.687 --> 04:14.955
I probably shouldn't come.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.622
But maybe you can mention
I'm reformed

04:16.622 --> 04:18.458
and I don't call women
[bleep] anymore?

04:18.459 --> 04:20.660
You know, don't push it,
but if it comes up organically.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.894
Yeah, I don't really
see a scenario

04:21.894 --> 04:23.562
where that comes up
organically,

04:23.564 --> 04:24.663
but I'll get ya in.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.000
Well, congrats, Harls.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.834
You're on the verge
of achieving your dream

04:27.834 --> 04:30.004
and I... I really do wish
I could be there to see it.

04:30.004 --> 04:32.305
But your name's
on the invitation.
You gotta come.

04:32.305 --> 04:34.774
Well, that's clearly a misprint
because I'm--

04:34.774 --> 04:36.576
[all] Not in the crew.
We've heard.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.677
Yeah. What they said.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.478
Fine. Be like that.

04:39.478 --> 04:41.882
[sighs dramatically]
I guess if I run
into Joker there,

04:41.882 --> 04:43.350
I'll just deal with it

04:43.350 --> 04:45.786
without my best friend
by my side.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.855
[sighs] Okay, I'll go.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.379
I knew you would.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.824
[Scarecrow] Pretty cool, huh?

04:51.824 --> 04:53.660
All the heavy hitters,

04:53.660 --> 04:56.797
Sinestro, Lex Luthor,
Roger Goodell.

04:56.896 --> 05:00.500
Ooh, uh, FYI,
we stand for the anthem here.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.437
This is
the big leagues of evil.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.773
[laughs cunningly]

05:06.874 --> 05:09.341
Oh! Think this
might interest you.

05:09.442 --> 05:11.444
It goes throughout
the entire office.

05:11.545 --> 05:16.449
[squeals joyfully] Is that
a fake diver and a castle?

05:16.550 --> 05:17.951
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

05:18.052 --> 05:20.553
That's a real diver,
and you're free to eat him.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.689
[screams with joy]
A real diver?

05:22.788 --> 05:24.757
[muffled voice]
A real diver?

05:24.858 --> 05:26.959
Is it my birthday?
[continues laughing]

05:26.959 --> 05:28.512
Ah, what'd I tell ya
about this place?

05:28.512 --> 05:30.629
Did I lie? Did I fuckin' lie?
I did not fuckin' lie.

05:30.629 --> 05:33.132
Also heard
we have an actor here.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.468
We do improv every Wednesday.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.004
Huzzah!

05:37.004 --> 05:39.906
And we've got every resource
your crew could want.

05:39.906 --> 05:42.009
So, you've got a fish tank
and you do improv?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.911
Wow, you're my shitty
college boyfriend.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.545
Oh, all right, yeah, I mean,

05:45.644 --> 05:47.081
did your college
boyfriend have...

05:48.115 --> 05:49.615
A kryptonite-powered submarine

05:49.615 --> 05:51.418
that can turn into a car
and shoot missiles.

05:51.517 --> 05:52.952
We have three of them.

05:52.952 --> 05:56.122
And they're available
to our members at any time.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.892
[elevator dings]

05:59.992 --> 06:02.096
Harley. So glad
you could make it.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.064
Lex, this place is amazing.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.177
Not too bad, huh?

06:05.177 --> 06:07.826
The grenade vending machine
and Kombucha on tap.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.269
I mean, you guys
thought of everything.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.904
I've been watching you
ever since you went solo,

06:12.004 --> 06:14.074
and I haven't seen
an evil rising star like you

06:14.173 --> 06:16.810
since, well, since me.

06:16.810 --> 06:17.810
Hey, buddy?

06:17.810 --> 06:19.550
Now that you're done
kissing your own asshole...

06:19.550 --> 06:20.550
That's not a phrase.

06:20.550 --> 06:21.668
...why are we here?

06:21.668 --> 06:24.218
Look, I'm sure you know
about prospective member night.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.418
Where every Legion member
can nominate someone to join?

06:26.519 --> 06:30.589
Well, Harley,
guess who I nominated? You.

06:30.589 --> 06:31.589
[squeals]

06:31.589 --> 06:33.259
So, come back tonight
for the party,

06:33.259 --> 06:35.262
meet everyone,
see how you mesh,

06:35.262 --> 06:36.963
and, maybe if it goes well,

06:36.963 --> 06:39.132
you could be the next member
of the LOD.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.567
That's what we call
the Legion of Doom.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.769
Oh, is that what it stand for?

06:42.769 --> 06:44.271
I thought it was
Legion of Dildos.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.800
That is a sex shop
down the street

06:45.800 --> 06:47.740
with whom we're currently
in a protracted legal battle.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.543
-So, I'll see you guys tonight?
-Uh, damn right you will.

06:50.543 --> 06:52.846
Oh, hey, do I need
to get my parking validated?

06:52.846 --> 06:54.014
We don't validate.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.050
So evil.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.500
Hey, let's hit the gift shop.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.819
They have those
mini-license plates

06:58.819 --> 07:00.086
with your name on 'em.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.988
Oh, um, yeah, yeah,
knock yourself out.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.723
I... I'm gonna catch up
with you in a bit.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.194
Hey, so what is your deal?

07:05.194 --> 07:06.927
Like, why are you suddenly
so interested in Harley

07:06.927 --> 07:08.595
after treating her like shit
for months?

07:08.595 --> 07:10.297
Do you know how many
invitations we've sent to you?

07:10.297 --> 07:11.761
Jesus, I dunno, millions.

07:11.761 --> 07:15.569
Calm down, it's 148.
And every time you rebuff us.

07:15.668 --> 07:16.903
Because I don't want to join

07:16.903 --> 07:18.872
your self-important
sausage party.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.540
-Hey. We have a woman.
-Good for you.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.776
I'm blanking on her name
right now, but she's lovely.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.776
Great.

07:23.810 --> 07:27.560
[dramatic music playing]

07:28.781 --> 07:30.983
Do you want to play around
or you want to get serious?

07:31.084 --> 07:32.252
Love that.

07:32.353 --> 07:34.021
You're the only one
that can do that,

07:34.120 --> 07:35.255
which is why you're right.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.790
I don't want Harley.
I want you.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.927
Then why did you
fuckin' invite her?

07:40.026 --> 07:42.562
Why did the Golden Globes
nominate <i>The Martian</i>
for best comedy?

07:42.661 --> 07:44.098
They wanted Matt Damon to show.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.766
In this metaphor,
you're Matt Damon.

07:46.766 --> 07:48.235
Yes, okay, I get it.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.269
It was just a very stupid
and outdated reference.

07:50.271 --> 07:51.557
I don't see a lot of movies.

07:51.557 --> 07:54.007
Look, I'm not joining
the Legion of Doom, okay?

07:54.007 --> 07:55.608
Or the LOD or the whatever.

07:55.709 --> 07:56.944
That's totally fine.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.577
Oh, just one thing
I forget to mention.

07:58.577 --> 08:00.913
If you don't join,
Harley doesn't get in either.

08:03.682 --> 08:05.052
Okay, they don't have Harley,

08:05.151 --> 08:07.288
but this is close enough.
Isn't this place awesome?

08:09.122 --> 08:12.158

God damn it!

08:16.163 --> 08:17.264
Son of a bitch.

08:17.363 --> 08:18.999
I didn't hear a damn thing.

[Tentacle Monster growling]

08:20.401 --> 08:21.668
What? You didn't here that?

08:23.702 --> 08:25.538
Oh, that thing?

08:25.639 --> 08:27.040
-Yes.
-Eh.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.108
That's just the pipes.

Ahh!

[groaning]

08:40.120 --> 08:41.384
[breathing heavily]

08:41.384 --> 08:44.024
Yeah, I'm gonna need you
to go ahead and explain that.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.025
[sighs] Okay.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.927
There may be

08:47.927 --> 08:50.562
a giant tentacle monster

everything out of your pockets?

Your metal exoskeleton?

09:05.245 --> 09:08.148
-Check your weapons, please.
-Ooh.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.017
Uh, That's not a weapon.

09:10.116 --> 09:14.120
Fine, but when I act someone
to death, you'll be blamed.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.789
Hey, do you... Do you think
Joker is gonna be here?

Ooh, there's my competition,

take off his machine gun arm.

I mean, this isn't you.

09:29.370 --> 09:30.600
But it can be.

I mean, it's aspirational
and classy and shit.

09:32.438 --> 09:33.899
Classy? Okay.

09:33.899 --> 09:36.009
'Cause this morning you drank
cereal out of a blender.

Oh, I have not turned my back
on the aquatic world.

09:46.220 --> 09:49.855

kindly go fuck yourself!

10:02.436 --> 10:05.239
So like, did you get an invite
to this thing or--

10:05.339 --> 10:08.908
Naw, naw, I picked up
a catering gig actually, yeah.

10:09.009 --> 10:12.245

it is pricey.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.798
What? He outclasses
any of these idiots. Okay?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.033
This is the problem
with this place.

18:32.980 --> 18:34.448
[screaming]

18:37.217 --> 18:40.287
[mumbling sadly]

18:40.386 --> 18:43.490
I'm so sorry, Mirielle.
Can ya ever forgive me?

18:43.490 --> 18:44.490
[Tentacle Monster growls]

18:44.490 --> 18:45.792
My own issues aside,

18:45.792 --> 18:47.827
can someone explain
why Sy is cryin'

18:47.827 --> 18:50.631
and where this giant
tentacle monster came from?

18:50.631 --> 18:52.732
Super-long story.
Short version.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.200
CIA experiment went wrong.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.256
That's his sister,

18:55.256 --> 18:57.202
and he hasn't been down here
for like 35 years.

18:57.203 --> 18:58.371
Yeah, uh that's what
I was gonna guess.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.272
[growling]

19:00.373 --> 19:03.476
Oh, I can't even imagine
what it must be like

19:03.477 --> 19:06.913
to go through life
a giant, deformed thing.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.482
You can't,
you can't imagine that?

19:09.583 --> 19:13.619
I don't know how I live
with myself. [cries]

19:13.720 --> 19:16.589
Oh, it's okay. Look,
why not try and talk to her?

19:16.589 --> 19:17.891
How?

19:17.991 --> 19:19.826
I'll do it.
I'll do it, I'll do it.

19:19.926 --> 19:20.961
Let me be your Whoopi.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.496
[Tentacle Monster screams]

19:22.596 --> 19:25.531
What?
<i>Ghost</i> affected everyone.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.567
It was a phenomenon.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.936
[vibrato intensifying]

19:31.371 --> 19:32.873
Talk to her.

19:32.972 --> 19:36.276
She may not speak English
but I bet she understands it.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.280
Mirie, I'm so sorry.

19:41.381 --> 19:44.550
I never shoulda forced you
to make that damn hybrid.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.486
[growls]

19:46.586 --> 19:48.320
Ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah.

19:48.421 --> 19:51.290
Okay, she said "I get that
you were confused and angry.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.614
So was I.

19:52.614 --> 19:54.928
But it wasn't being turned
into a tentacle monster

19:54.929 --> 19:56.363
that made me angry."

19:56.363 --> 19:57.529
Wow,
this is getting interesting.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.599
[growling]

19:59.700 --> 20:02.603
"I was angry
because you walked away.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.503
You closed yourself off
from me.

20:04.505 --> 20:06.941
I didn't just lose
my brother that day,

20:07.040 --> 20:09.108
I lost my best friend."

20:09.109 --> 20:11.444
[Mirielle growling]

20:11.545 --> 20:14.647
[Dr. Psycho] She kept hoping
you would reach out,

20:14.748 --> 20:16.316
<i>but you never did.</i>

20:19.318 --> 20:21.721
[growling]

20:21.721 --> 20:23.022
One more time
on that last part?

20:23.022 --> 20:24.022
[growls]

20:24.022 --> 20:25.826
Right. Right, okay.

20:25.925 --> 20:30.830
She says, "I always thought
no matter how bad it got,

20:30.931 --> 20:33.567
you'd never give up
on our friendship."

20:33.666 --> 20:35.602
I should've come to you,

20:35.701 --> 20:38.538
but I was afraid
I let it go too long.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.406
That you wouldn't forgive me.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.742
[growling]

20:42.843 --> 20:44.510
This is everything.

20:44.611 --> 20:47.647
I don't need
a translation for this.

20:47.748 --> 20:50.717
I never should've kept you
locked up down here,

20:50.817 --> 20:54.287
so from now on, you're free.

20:56.056 --> 20:58.525
[growling]

20:58.625 --> 21:00.460
Look at her go.

21:00.559 --> 21:04.064
That's my girl.
Run, baby, run.

21:04.164 --> 21:06.732
Oh, she looks great.
She seems so happy.

21:06.834 --> 21:08.001
[growling]

21:09.036 --> 21:10.569
[people screaming]

21:10.671 --> 21:11.904
[growling]

21:12.006 --> 21:13.941
[man screams] I'm in...
I'm in its mouth.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.308
[people screaming]

21:16.409 --> 21:19.709
Oh, I'm just gonna...

21:23.851 --> 21:24.951
[device beeps]

21:25.885 --> 21:27.354
[device beeps]

21:27.453 --> 21:28.453
[device beeps]

21:31.557 --> 21:32.557
[device beeps]

21:33.160 --> 21:35.863
Woo! Oh, Harley, Harley.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.498
Whatever weird sex thing
you had to do

21:38.597 --> 21:40.599
to get me back into
the Legion of Doom,

21:40.701 --> 21:41.701
I thank you.

21:41.701 --> 21:42.970
Yeah, that's not what happened.

21:42.970 --> 21:43.970
Uh-huh. Wink, wink.

21:43.970 --> 21:44.970
On a related note,

21:44.971 --> 21:46.471
you can't go on any capers

21:46.471 --> 21:48.107
where the crew might interact
with a female superhero.

21:48.107 --> 21:51.557
Yeah, that seems fair.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.586
Ready to put
your life behind you

21:59.586 --> 22:01.954
and make the world
an even worse place?

22:01.954 --> 22:02.954
Sure thing, Lex.

22:02.954 --> 22:03.954
Good.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.932
[sighs]

22:13.032 --> 22:14.968
Oh, and by the way,

22:15.068 --> 22:17.804
another member
insisted on dropping by.

22:19.073 --> 22:23.476
Hi, Harley. [laughs]
