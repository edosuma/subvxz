00:01.543 --> 00:04.796
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.880 --> 00:07.883
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.008 --> 00:11.220
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:14.014
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.224 --> 00:17.518
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.435 --> 00:21.438
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:23.148
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:24.733
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.816 --> 00:29.905
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:35.494 --> 00:38.914
<i>We now return to</i>
Sesame Street. <i>Now on HBO.</i>

00:45.420 --> 00:47.256
Oh, hi, you guys, how was school?

00:47.339 --> 00:49.550
Honestly, Mom, today was kind of weird.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.010
Every kid in school had to write
a list of five reasons

00:52.094 --> 00:54.930
Principal Shepherd is cool,
and then have their parents sign it.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.015
What? That seems crazy!

00:57.099 --> 01:00.102
One time I saw him pee in a urinal
with his hands on his hips.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.520
That's pretty boss.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.189
Why would the principal
make all the students do that?

01:04.273 --> 01:06.859
I don't know.
I think he's going through a tough time.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.652
He's in the middle of a bad divorce.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.195
What? How do you know that?

01:10.279 --> 01:12.531
He's actually been pretty open about it.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.033
<i>Good morning, students. Today, at 3:30,</i>

01:15.117 --> 01:18.120
<i>James Woods High will be hosting</i>
<i>a cross-country meet.</i>

01:18.203 --> 01:22.207
<i>Which also happens to be where Lorraine</i>
<i>has threatened to take my children,</i>

01:22.291 --> 01:23.709
<i>across the country.</i>

01:23.792 --> 01:26.253
<i>And here's today's Tuesday Trivia</i>
<i>question.</i>

01:26.336 --> 01:27.588
<i>Does this sound like yelling?</i>

01:27.671 --> 01:29.882
<i>Because, apparently, this sounds</i>
<i>to some people like yelling.</i>

01:36.430 --> 01:38.390
All right, finally. Some peace and quiet,

01:38.473 --> 01:40.475
so I can buckle down
and get some writing done.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.231
- Hey, Bonnie.
- What?

01:46.315 --> 01:49.234
Listen to this.
Say "It's all been a pack of lies."

01:49.318 --> 01:50.861
What? Why?

01:50.944 --> 01:54.031
Just do it.
Just say "It's all been a pack of lies."

01:54.114 --> 01:56.200
It's all been a pack of lies.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.913
That sounded really good!

02:00.996 --> 02:03.415
Thanks, babe. Do you know
what that song is about?

02:03.498 --> 02:07.252
Phil Collins watching some guy
watch another guy drown.

02:07.336 --> 02:09.755
And then, the next night,
he invited the watching guy

02:09.838 --> 02:11.590
to be in the front row of his concert

02:11.673 --> 02:15.093
so he could sing it right to him
and then could arrest the guy.

02:15.177 --> 02:18.555
Really? Why wouldn't he have
just helped the guy who was drowning?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.725
I don't know. I think it was
on a bridge or something, like,

02:21.808 --> 02:24.436
he could see it, but,
he couldn't get there in time.

02:24.520 --> 02:28.273
But he let a whole day pass?
Why didn't he call the cops?

02:28.357 --> 02:30.108
'Cause he was busy writing the song.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.944
Wait. If he just watched,

02:32.027 --> 02:34.530
doesn't that also make him a
little guilty?

02:34.613 --> 02:37.282
Look, I'm not saying we wouldn't
bring Phil Collins in for questioning.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.952
I feel like maybe
this story is bogus!

02:40.035 --> 02:41.954
Now, hang on. Let me check Snopes.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.999
- Yeah, none of that happened.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.292
Hey, what's up?

02:47.376 --> 02:50.671
Well, I'm trying to work on a sequel
to <i>The Old Man and the Sea.</i>

02:50.754 --> 02:52.422
Are you... Are you allowed to do that?

02:52.506 --> 02:55.217
But I can't get anything done.
It's so damn loud around here.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.469
Oh, yeah, that's what Hemingway
used to complain about.

02:57.553 --> 03:00.013
"This Spanish Civil War is just too loud!

03:00.097 --> 03:01.807
"How am I supposed to get anything done?"

03:01.890 --> 03:03.976
No, I mean, it might sound silly, but,

03:04.059 --> 03:06.562
I used to daydream that by now
I would have my own place

03:06.645 --> 03:07.813
by a lake somewhere.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.773
An oasis where I could go to write.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.942
Pay the bills by renting out the rooms.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.152
Like a B and B? That could be fun.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.529
What? What are you talking about?

03:15.612 --> 03:17.823
I'm talking about you and me
opening a B and B!

03:17.906 --> 03:19.783
Are you serious? That'd be great!

03:19.867 --> 03:22.327
- Sure, it will be fun.
- All right, let's give it a try.

03:22.411 --> 03:25.038
Can't be any worse that when I was
on the Night's Watch.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.916
Hey, guys, you all want to say
the oath again?

03:33.422 --> 03:34.506
For the Watch.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.466
For the Watch!

03:36.800 --> 03:39.219
- For the Watch.

03:39.303 --> 03:40.929
- Hi, Brian.

03:41.013 --> 03:44.141
I'm the boring storyline of the fat guy
that's watching that girl.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.476
- And I'm <i>Ballers!</i>
- Ow!

03:48.562 --> 03:51.064
I totally get it. You're right to do this.

03:56.695 --> 03:59.239
Well, well, if it isn't Meg Griffin.

03:59.323 --> 04:00.908
Leave me alone, you guys.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.535
Relax. We're taking the day off
from bullying.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.204
Oh. Thank God.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.167
Very funny.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.085
Who put the Ark of the Covenant in here?

04:13.795 --> 04:15.547
Meg is so stupid.

04:15.631 --> 04:18.383
She couldn't handle the glory
of God's love.

04:18.467 --> 04:21.595
Students, faculty and staff
of James Woods High.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.681
Does anyone know how to push down
the backseat of a Highlander?

04:24.765 --> 04:27.726
I know I can make a bed in there.
I just don't know how.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.229
Oh, my God,
Principal Shepherd, what's wrong?

04:30.312 --> 04:32.731
I just listened to two hours
of butt-dialed sex

04:32.814 --> 04:35.067
between my wife and the ADT alarm guy.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.069
Why didn't you just hang up?

04:37.152 --> 04:39.738
Because I miss the sound of her voice!

04:41.615 --> 04:43.575
Oh, my God!

04:43.659 --> 04:44.660
<i>Principal Shepherd, </i>

04:44.743 --> 04:46.119
<i>your wife is on the line.</i>

04:46.203 --> 04:47.371
<i>She says...</i>

04:47.454 --> 04:49.873
<i>"Oh, God! Harder!"</i>

04:57.172 --> 04:59.842
Man, I still can't get over
how perfect this place is.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.636
I know. It's going to be
such a darling B and B.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.721
I got the boiler up and running,
Mr. Griffin.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.849
Well, we don't have a boiler,
but I can't wait to see

05:06.932 --> 05:08.308
what you've done in the cellar.

05:08.392 --> 05:11.270
Also, please rub the "H" and the "C"
off all the knobs,

05:11.353 --> 05:13.480
so people won't know
what the hell is going on.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.649
I want the first four minutes
of every shower

05:15.732 --> 05:17.609
to be confusion and anger.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.533
Welcome, members of our
school community.

05:24.616 --> 05:27.286
Let's call to order this emergency meeting
of the school board,

05:27.369 --> 05:29.621
regarding Principal Shepherd's meltdown.

05:29.705 --> 05:32.291
I know a number of our students
have felt...

05:32.374 --> 05:35.878
"Traumatized" by the events of this week.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.589
And we take those concerns very seriously.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.467
- Lois, I'm done with my gum.
- I don't want it.

05:42.551 --> 05:45.470
- But I'm done with it!
- Peter, shh!

05:45.554 --> 05:46.722
I'll take it.

05:48.390 --> 05:51.685
So, due to his erratic behavior,
we have placed Principal Shepherd

05:51.768 --> 05:53.562
on indefinite paid leave.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.815
Typically, Vice Principal Maguire
would step in.

05:56.899 --> 06:00.777
However, I was informed earlier today
that she was found dead in her car.

06:03.572 --> 06:06.074
Therefore, the board is seeking
a parent volunteer

06:06.158 --> 06:07.701
to serve as interim principal

06:07.784 --> 06:10.037
until a permanent replacement
can be found.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.496
Lois, maybe I should do it.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.499
I've always wanted a job
where I can let my dandruff go wild.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.794
What? No way! I'm not having my dad
be the principal.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.421
How embarrassing!

06:19.505 --> 06:22.841
Yeah, no offense, Peter, but I don't know
if you should be running a school.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.843
What are you talking about?
I'm a natural leader.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.679
That's why I'm so good
at leading "Simon Says."

06:27.763 --> 06:29.932
Simon says "leave the band."

06:31.558 --> 06:32.976
Yeah, I don't know.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.188
You know what? You guys are wrong
and I'm going to prove it to you.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.814
Again, any volunteers?

06:37.898 --> 06:39.900
I'll be your new principal.

06:39.983 --> 06:43.028
Wonderful. Why don't you
come on up and introduce yourself?

06:43.111 --> 06:46.490
All right. James Woods High cheerleaders,
give me a hand.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.370
<i>Check him out</i>
<i>Check, check him out</i>

06:51.453 --> 06:53.205
<i>- My name is Peter</i>
<i>- Check</i>

06:53.288 --> 06:54.873
<i>- That ain't no lie</i>
<i>- Check</i>

06:54.957 --> 06:58.627
<i>I go pop, pop, fizz, fizz</i>
<i>Oh, how sweet it is</i>

06:58.710 --> 06:59.920
<i>Check, check</i>

07:01.338 --> 07:02.881
I'm done with this gum now.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.967
- I don't want it.
- But I'm done with it.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.894
Mom, why was this Listerine
in the garbage?

07:15.978 --> 07:17.896
Oh, your father says
he doesn't need it anymore,

07:17.980 --> 07:19.606
now that he's a high school principal.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.942
Oh, my God!
He's not really doing that, is he?

07:22.025 --> 07:24.361
I'm only going to get bullied worse now!

07:24.444 --> 07:27.155
Hello, <i>Breakfast Club.</i>

07:27.239 --> 07:29.908
As the principal, I like to start
each morning with a reference

07:29.992 --> 07:31.034
from last century.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.953
Dad, I don't want you to do this!

07:33.036 --> 07:35.247
Too late. I've already been practicing
giving students

07:35.330 --> 07:37.457
awkward and uncoordinated high fives.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.750
Chris, if I may.

07:40.794 --> 07:44.298
Yay! Two fingers inside of the palm
contact!

07:44.381 --> 07:46.383
- Perfect!
- All right, I got to get to work

07:46.466 --> 07:49.887
by 7:40 because that's when
high school starts for some reason.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.431
See you at the way-too-early 10:40 lunch.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.393
I feel you, Meg.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.270
- Shut up.
- You shut up!

08:04.902 --> 08:07.779
Wow. Look at us. Running a B and B.

08:07.863 --> 08:10.449
Yes, so far, all the guests seem
very happy.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.743
Hi, we're checking out.
Just charge my card.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.206
That's weird. That's the fifth couple
to check out after only an hour.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.916
Hi, we'd like a room, please.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.668
Wait, I'm sorry. Weren't you just here
a moment ago with a different man?

08:21.752 --> 08:23.337
Oh, crap!

08:23.712 --> 08:24.838
Stewie, we have a problem.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.633
The only people checking in are here
to have sex with prostitutes.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.009
What? Nonsense!

08:29.092 --> 08:30.177
Then why are they all signing

08:30.260 --> 08:32.346
the guest book and writing
great things like

08:32.429 --> 08:33.805
"Railed Crystal good"?

08:33.889 --> 08:34.973
Oh...

08:35.057 --> 08:38.393
Damn it, this is awful.
How could I have not noticed sooner?

08:38.477 --> 08:41.271
I mean, it's more obvious
than when George Takei was in the closet.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.273
Hey, George, how are you?

08:43.357 --> 08:45.526
I'm heterosexual.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.319
I love vaginas.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.613
Yum, yum, yum...

08:49.696 --> 08:50.864
So, what are you doing tonight?

08:50.948 --> 08:53.534
Hopefully, choking on some vagina.

08:53.617 --> 08:54.868
Oh, nubbers!

08:55.619 --> 08:57.371
All right, that sounds fun. See you later.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.498
I'm a heterosexual.

09:04.419 --> 09:08.423
Good morning, children.
I am your interim principal, Mr. Griffin.

09:08.507 --> 09:12.052
And to show I'm a fun principal,
I'm going to do the Ice Bucket Challenge.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.930
Three years too late,
but right on time for a principal

09:15.013 --> 09:17.933
and making no less sense
than it did when it was current.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.314
You're welcome,
person who is probably already dead.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.692
But, hey!
Now I've got something even more fun.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.236
How about we all do
an expertly choreographed lip-dub

09:29.319 --> 09:30.612
to a popular song?

09:39.788 --> 09:43.625
<i>This hit, that ice cold</i>
<i>Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold</i>

09:43.709 --> 09:47.838
<i>This one for them hood girls</i>
<i>Them good girls straight masterpieces</i>

09:47.921 --> 09:51.633
<i>Stylin', whilen, livin' it up in the city</i>

09:56.013 --> 09:57.973
<i>- I'm too hot</i>
<i>- Hot damn</i>

09:58.056 --> 10:00.475
<i>Call the police and a fireman</i>

10:04.813 --> 10:08.442
Ladies, this is my associate.
Brian, bitches. Bitches, Brian.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.152
What? What's all this?

10:10.235 --> 10:12.654
This, Brian, is called "diversification."

10:12.738 --> 10:15.199
You see, if our guests insist
on bringing prostitutes

10:15.324 --> 10:18.577
into our B and B,
we might as well provide the women, too.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.829
What? Stewie,
we're not going to become pimps.

10:20.913 --> 10:22.915
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.375
The answer is no, so, don't bother
flashing a wad of money

10:25.459 --> 10:28.045
because there's no way I'm going to
change my answer in the middle

10:28.128 --> 10:30.422
of this sentence... Okay, maybe we can
try it out and see how it goes.

10:30.506 --> 10:33.175
Hey, what are you girls doing
standing around? Get to work.

10:34.760 --> 10:38.347
I'm telling you, that dog is
very easily persuaded.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.517
Now, let's see what's going on
at the old high school.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.728
Ooh... Ooh...

10:51.026 --> 10:52.110
Hey, guys, guys.

10:52.194 --> 10:55.447
When Borat was making announcements
over the P.A. this morning,

10:55.531 --> 10:56.865
that was me.

10:56.949 --> 10:59.159
What? Shut the front door!

10:59.243 --> 11:02.120
Taco Tuesday is nice.

11:02.204 --> 11:04.331
Knock it off! Give me back my lunch.

11:04.414 --> 11:07.793
What have we got here?
Grape juice in a Ziploc bag?

11:07.876 --> 11:09.878
I have to make my own Capri Suns.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.550
Hey, stupid. What the hell are you doing?
That's my daughter.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.927
Yeah? What are you going to do about it?

11:17.010 --> 11:19.388
What am I going to do about it?
I'll knock your teeth down your throat

11:19.471 --> 11:21.974
- and out your butt, you little bastard.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.643
Oh, you think that's funny?
Him spilling juice all over the floor?

11:24.726 --> 11:26.645
This is going to make
people's sneakers sticky.

11:26.728 --> 11:30.232
And then we're going to have to
listen to... All day!

11:30.315 --> 11:32.734
Well, I won't have it.
Get on your knees and lick that up.

11:32.818 --> 11:34.820
What? Are you serious?

11:34.903 --> 11:36.488
Yeah, I'm serious. I'm the principal.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.081
Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

11:46.164 --> 11:49.501
What are you talking about? That jerk
is finally getting what he deserves.

11:49.585 --> 11:51.753
Yeah, Meg.
Now that your dad is the principal,

11:51.837 --> 11:54.173
you could finally have power
over the bullies.

11:54.256 --> 11:55.966
Now, you little punks get to class.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.094
And if you see Ms. Millikin,
tell her I said, "Hey, what's up?"

11:59.887 --> 12:02.097
Huh. Maybe you're right.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.142
Wow, Dad, that was really something.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.686
- Ms. Millikin is just a friend.
- Oh, I don't mean that.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.606
I mean the way you handled those guys
that were picking on me.

12:10.689 --> 12:13.150
Really? I felt like I kind of lost
my cool there.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.236
Not at all!
That's what you've got to do more of.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.072
- You were like a real principal there.
- I was?

12:19.156 --> 12:21.617
Yeah. In fact,
if you're going to lead this school,

12:21.700 --> 12:23.702
you've got to know
that kids need discipline.

12:23.785 --> 12:27.539
Especially kids like them.
And their friends Jeremy and Bridget.

12:27.623 --> 12:31.460
Oh, really? Where might I find
this Jeremy and Bridget?

12:31.877 --> 12:33.545
I don't know. Study Hall, second floor.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.259
All right, listen up, maggots. Fun's over.

12:39.343 --> 12:41.345
There's going to be some changes
around here.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.222
And what better way to show you
I'm serious

12:43.305 --> 12:45.474
than to smash a desk with a baseball bat.

12:48.644 --> 12:49.645
Ow!

12:53.148 --> 12:54.983
Ow!

13:01.323 --> 13:02.449
Ow!

13:22.261 --> 13:23.262
Argh!

13:28.058 --> 13:29.935
Okay, we'll pick this up on Monday.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.770
Do any of you know my wife, Lois?

13:31.854 --> 13:34.857
Tell her I'm on the bats and to come
get me. She'll know what it means.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.866
Let's go. Keep it moving. Get to class.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.994
Hey, you! You salute that flag
when you walk by, kid.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.913
Loads of people fought for that thing,
including yours truly.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.124
You were in the Service?

13:52.207 --> 13:54.585
I may have misunderstood what
"yours truly" means.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.461
Hey, Dad, listen.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.172
The four of us got together last night

13:58.297 --> 14:01.216
and we came up with a list
of 11 students and two teachers

14:01.300 --> 14:02.885
that you need to do something about.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.804
- Maybe you should start with Mark Relich.
- Why? What did he do?

14:05.888 --> 14:08.223
He wouldn't kiss Ruth
at the Sadie Hawkins' Dance,

14:08.307 --> 14:10.726
even though she bought him dinner before
at Walt's Roast Beef.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.896
- I don't see how that's got anything...
- And he called you fat.

14:13.979 --> 14:16.315
- Oh, I'm going to squish him!
- That's right.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.358
Don't take any crap from anyone.

14:18.442 --> 14:21.361
Well, I won't. I'm going to take down
all these punks,

14:21.445 --> 14:24.114
just like I did in my 1980's crime series,

14:24.198 --> 14:26.408
<i>Hockey Cop.</i>

14:26.909 --> 14:28.076
- Give me that purse.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.286
Hey, criminals.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.539
Puck you!

14:36.001 --> 14:38.504
Get the puck out of my neighborhood.

14:40.172 --> 14:43.091
- Go puck yourself.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.676
Uh-oh. Here come the real cops.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.597
<i>Hockey cop, not a cop.</i>

14:53.977 --> 14:56.939
All right, ladies, I'm going to put this
as gently as I can.

14:57.022 --> 15:00.400
But it appears that someone's rectum
fell out on the stairs.

15:00.484 --> 15:02.194
Now, whose is it? Be honest.

15:03.362 --> 15:06.073
All right, that's fine,
but let's just agree on a rule

15:06.156 --> 15:08.200
that if your rectum falls out
on the stairs,

15:08.283 --> 15:10.118
it's on you to pick it up.

15:10.202 --> 15:11.286
Look at that, Brian.

15:11.370 --> 15:14.122
Our day has just begun
and there's a line out the door.

15:14.206 --> 15:15.958
I know. We're raking it in.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.877
This is a hell of a lot easier than
when I delivered pizza in New Orleans.

15:20.671 --> 15:21.922
What the hell?

15:22.631 --> 15:24.424
<i>We're all just blocking the street</i>

15:24.508 --> 15:26.301
<i>We're all just blocking the street</i>

15:26.385 --> 15:28.220
Come on, I got to deliver this pizza.

15:28.887 --> 15:32.599
<i>Five trumpets do the job of one</i>
<i>We're all just blocking the street</i>

15:32.683 --> 15:34.810
I need to be there in 30 minutes.
It's a company promise.

15:34.893 --> 15:38.814
<i>Half a band is a limber band</i>
<i>We're all just blocking the street</i>

15:38.897 --> 15:39.982
Oh, thank God!

15:40.065 --> 15:44.152
<i>One of us dropped a contact lens</i>
<i>We're going back to block the street</i>

15:44.236 --> 15:45.320
Ah, screw it.

15:45.404 --> 15:49.241
<i>We won't stop blocking the street</i>
<i>Never stop blocking the street</i>

15:53.120 --> 15:56.081
Okay, so I think Lee Blanding
gets detention.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.166
And, for Jason O'Neil,

15:58.250 --> 16:00.002
maybe you could pants him
during an assembly.

16:00.085 --> 16:01.420
Yes, good, I like that.

16:02.087 --> 16:04.506
Oh, hi, you two. What are you working on?

16:04.590 --> 16:10.012
Nothing. I, um... I'm just helping Dad
with his schedule for tomorrow.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.681
You know, he's really doing a great job.

16:12.764 --> 16:15.142
He's actually made the school
a lot better.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.936
Huh. Well, I got to admit,
I was skeptical,

16:18.020 --> 16:20.397
but it sounds like things are
going pretty well down there.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.773
You bet they are.

16:21.857 --> 16:24.693
- They'll go even better after the Purge.
- The what?

16:24.776 --> 16:26.320
Hey, Meg. How about one of these?

16:27.821 --> 16:29.198
One of them things, yeah?

16:29.281 --> 16:30.741
Peter, what the hell are you doing?

16:30.824 --> 16:34.036
Uh... He's just saying
he wants to use his key

16:34.119 --> 16:37.456
to drive me to school tomorrow in his car.

16:37.539 --> 16:40.209
Peter, what exactly are you doing
down at that school?

16:40.292 --> 16:42.878
I'll tell you what I'm doing.
I'm doing a great job.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.671
Like when I was a pro football kicker.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.969
Yay! Now I can fist bump with black guys.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.679
- Nailed it, Peter.
- There you go.

16:52.763 --> 16:54.389
Yeah, we're going to the club tonight?

16:54.473 --> 16:56.099
- Not you.
- Okay!

17:01.104 --> 17:03.106
Hey, Brian, what's a splat job?

17:03.190 --> 17:06.193
I don't know, Stewie.
I'm worried that you're seeing too much.

17:07.945 --> 17:08.946
Good morning, ladies.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.657
Were the paramedics
able to resuscitate Lamar Odom?

17:11.740 --> 17:12.991
They're still working on it.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.918
He's tall, get it?

17:23.001 --> 17:24.920
Okay, show's over. Everybody back to work.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.964
Yeah, about that. We gotta talk.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.924
Oh, uh, sure. What's up?

17:29.007 --> 17:31.677
We just realized we can keep
all the money,

17:31.760 --> 17:34.972
take your house and kill you
if you try to do anything about it.

17:36.431 --> 17:39.184
All right. We're just going to step
outside and figure out a counter.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.605
- And they locked us out.

17:43.689 --> 17:46.066
What about my loaf
of cinnamon-raisin bread?

17:46.149 --> 17:48.360
It's mine! It's not for the whole house.

17:56.869 --> 17:59.496
- Let's just go. They won.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.206
Oh, we'll see about that.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.626
Hello. I'd like to report a brothel

18:04.710 --> 18:07.296
operating on Route Six
near Round Hill Road.

18:07.379 --> 18:08.672
Thank you.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.425
You want to eat mangled raisin bread
across the street

18:11.508 --> 18:13.135
and watch the cops raid the place?

18:13.218 --> 18:15.012
Yeah, I'd like that.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.985
Oh, here comes the UPS guy.

18:30.068 --> 18:33.322
Oh, I bet he's delivering
those marmalade jars we ordered.

18:33.405 --> 18:35.365
Doesn't that feel like a million years
ago?

18:35.449 --> 18:38.410
Yeah, we don't need those anymore.
Sorry, just send them back.

18:41.705 --> 18:42.831
You can just do that?

18:42.915 --> 18:46.084
Oh, yeah, you can just refuse delivery.
You've never done that?

18:46.168 --> 18:48.420
I... I genuinely did not know
you could do that.

18:48.504 --> 18:49.671
Well, you can.

18:49.755 --> 18:52.341
Anything you order, if you don't
sign for it, it has to go back.

18:52.424 --> 18:53.675
Everyone does it.

18:53.759 --> 18:57.262
Most of what America is now
is just boxes going back and forth.

19:04.436 --> 19:07.189
Students, this is a chair without a seat.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.983
Jeff Banfield, I'd like you to please
come down here,

19:10.067 --> 19:11.652
take your pants off and sit.

19:11.735 --> 19:15.113
- Me? What did I do?
- You know what you did, Jeff!

19:15.197 --> 19:16.782
I don't even know what's going on!

19:16.865 --> 19:20.369
Just go, Jeff, or he'll start hitting
that trash can with a spoon again.

19:20.452 --> 19:22.329
That means now, Mr. Banfield.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.213
What is going on here?

19:31.296 --> 19:33.006
Just a little of the three Rs.

19:33.090 --> 19:36.176
Reading, 'riting and rucking
this guy's sack.

19:36.260 --> 19:39.054
The School Board received
a very serious complaint.

19:39.137 --> 19:42.307
Mr. Griffin,
you are hereby relieved of your duties.

19:43.559 --> 19:46.144
- A promotion?
- No, you're fired.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.063
We've re-instated Principal Shepherd.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.773
Wait, he's back?

19:49.857 --> 19:52.276
But he had that crazy meltdown
about his divorce.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.820
Yes, but then I went on a sex trip
to Thailand

19:54.903 --> 19:57.281
and I banged all the goofy right
out of me.

19:57.364 --> 20:00.659
Wait, Dad is fired? Who did this?
Who turned him in?

20:01.451 --> 20:02.452
I did.

20:02.536 --> 20:04.454
- Hi, Mrs. Griffin!
- Hi.

20:04.538 --> 20:05.789
Hi, Patty.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.083
Why, Mom?

20:08.166 --> 20:11.044
Because what you and your father
have been doing is wrong!

20:11.128 --> 20:12.713
We'll talk about this at home.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.884
Well, I guess your mom was
right all along.

20:17.551 --> 20:19.678
I had no business running a school.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.763
Can I be honest with you, Dad?

20:22.347 --> 20:24.099
I thought you were awesome!

20:24.183 --> 20:26.768
You stood up for all the kids
who get picked on.

20:26.852 --> 20:28.687
You stood up for me!

20:28.770 --> 20:32.316
Wow, so, you think I did a good job
being principal?

20:32.399 --> 20:35.110
No. You did a good job being my dad.

20:40.866 --> 20:42.951
Come on, Meg, let's go home.

20:43.035 --> 20:44.953
And next time I want to get back
at your bullies,

20:45.037 --> 20:46.788
I'll do it the old fashioned way.

20:46.872 --> 20:49.875
As a grown man beating up teenagers
in a parking lot.

20:53.212 --> 20:55.422
I'm planning on dying tonight.

20:56.924 --> 20:58.467
What are your plans?
