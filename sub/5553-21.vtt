WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:05.398
I have a question
about Batman.

00:05.400 --> 00:09.539
Batman is a man
who dresses up like a bat.

00:09.540 --> 00:13.909
Man-bat is a part man,
part bat hybrid.

00:13.911 --> 00:15.343
Now,

00:15.345 --> 00:18.647
if Man-Bat dressed up as a man
to fight crime,

00:18.649 --> 00:21.983
would he be Man-Batman?

00:21.985 --> 00:25.087
No, he'd be Bat-Man-Bat.

00:26.123 --> 00:28.490
But wouldn't Man-Batman
just be a Batman

00:28.492 --> 00:31.126
that was bitten by
a radioactive man?

00:31.128 --> 00:33.095
But Batman is a man.

00:33.097 --> 00:36.131
You're talking about a man who
would have the powers of a man.

00:36.133 --> 00:39.134
That's just Man-Man.

00:39.136 --> 00:40.969
Well, isn't Man-Man just Man?

00:40.971 --> 00:42.938
But what if Man-Man
dressed as a bat?

00:42.940 --> 00:43.839
Well, that's just Batman.

00:43.841 --> 00:45.874
No, if a man dresses as a bat,

00:45.876 --> 00:48.043
that's Batman,
but if Man-Man dresses as a bat,

00:48.045 --> 00:49.845
that's Batman-Man.

00:49.847 --> 00:51.413
(cell phone chimes)

00:51.415 --> 00:52.948
So does that answer
your question?

00:52.950 --> 00:55.650
Oh, I haven't asked it yet.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.019
Oh, that's Claire.
Got to run.

00:58.021 --> 01:00.055
I thought you were back
with Emily.

01:00.057 --> 01:02.757
Uh, actually I'm...
seeing both of them.

01:02.759 --> 01:06.461
You mean like through their
window from behind a bush?

01:07.931 --> 01:10.799
No, I'm actually dating
two women.

01:10.801 --> 01:13.502
Later.

01:13.504 --> 01:15.337
(chuckles)
Really?

01:15.339 --> 01:17.672
The guy who for years
couldn't even talk to women

01:17.674 --> 01:19.307
is suddenly going out
with two of them?

01:19.309 --> 01:21.176
How is that possible?
WOLOWITZ: I know.

01:21.178 --> 01:22.644
Scientists have tried
to reproduce it

01:22.646 --> 01:23.879
with computational models,

01:23.881 --> 01:27.015
but, in each case,
the world blows up.

01:32.256 --> 01:34.556
Seriously, that guy's
dating two women?

02:07.572 --> 02:09.305
What, why did you get
a party sub?

02:09.306 --> 02:11.374
People are coming over;
it looked fun.

02:11.376 --> 02:14.511
Well, we're only watching
<i>Game of Thrones.</i>

02:14.513 --> 02:15.912
A party sub implies
it's a party.

02:15.914 --> 02:19.849
Your attendance implies
it's not.

02:19.851 --> 02:22.185
I like a party
as much as the next man,

02:22.187 --> 02:24.287
as long as the next man
doesn't like a party.

02:24.289 --> 02:27.490
Oh, by the way,
don't forget,

02:27.492 --> 02:29.893
tomorrow is our quarterly
Roommate Agreement meeting.

02:29.895 --> 02:31.327
Oh, Sheldon, we don't
need a meeting

02:31.329 --> 02:32.729
every three months.
Hmm?

02:32.731 --> 02:35.131
Well, it sounds like the kind of
thing one would bring up

02:35.133 --> 02:36.599
at a quarterly
Roommate Agreement meeting.

02:36.601 --> 02:39.002
Lucky for you it's tomorrow.

02:39.004 --> 02:40.537
Oh, you know what?

02:40.539 --> 02:41.738
I'm not going.

02:41.740 --> 02:43.273
Well, you have to go.

02:43.275 --> 02:46.376
It's Penny's first time leading
the Pledge of Allegiance.

02:46.378 --> 02:49.679
This meeting is a waste of time.

02:49.681 --> 02:50.947
Whether we make the switch

02:50.949 --> 02:52.882
from Post Raisin Bran
to Kellogg's Raisin Bran

02:52.884 --> 02:55.852
should not require
parliamentary procedure.

02:55.854 --> 02:59.722
You realize one of them
has sugar on the raisins.

02:59.724 --> 03:02.525
You're the only one
who eats them!

03:02.527 --> 03:04.160
And yet you get to weigh in.

03:04.162 --> 03:05.828
Democracy-- it's pretty cool,
isn't it?

03:05.830 --> 03:08.865
I'm not going;
you can't make me.

03:08.867 --> 03:10.533
Well, we'll just see about that.

03:10.535 --> 03:12.035
What is the problem?

03:12.037 --> 03:13.102
He says he's not coming

03:13.104 --> 03:14.237
to the Roommate Agreement
meeting tomorrow.

03:14.239 --> 03:17.040
Well, why the hell did
I memorize the Pledge?

03:19.044 --> 03:20.877
You have fun.
I will not be attending.

03:20.879 --> 03:22.278
Oh, fine.
We don't have to have

03:22.280 --> 03:23.880
a Roommate Agreement meeting
if you don't want to.

03:23.882 --> 03:25.848
Thank you.
Of course, it will require a vote.

03:25.850 --> 03:28.885
Unfortunately, my official gavel
is in my bedroom,

03:28.887 --> 03:31.087
but luckily,
I have my travel gavel.

03:33.959 --> 03:36.092
You're being ridiculous.

03:36.094 --> 03:37.694
There's a motion on the floor,
"I'm ridiculous."

03:37.696 --> 03:38.795
Do we have a second?

03:38.797 --> 03:40.330
Hmm? Hmm?
There is no second.

03:40.332 --> 03:41.497
The motion is denied.

03:41.499 --> 03:43.533
Next time, make sure
you have the votes first.

03:43.535 --> 03:44.534
That was embarrassing.

03:44.536 --> 03:47.403
Can you please
talk to him?

03:47.405 --> 03:49.105
Well, why are you
fighting him on this?

03:49.107 --> 03:51.741
Because I am tired of him
always getting his way.

03:51.743 --> 03:52.909
We don't need a stupid meeting.

03:52.911 --> 03:54.177
We don't even need
a Roommate Agreement,

03:54.179 --> 03:56.613
and I hope that sandwich
<i>does</i> cause a party!

03:58.383 --> 04:00.683
Well, I will still
come to your meeting.

04:00.685 --> 04:02.525
Well, I should hope so.
Tomorrow's picture day.

04:04.189 --> 04:06.155
Why are you
taking his side?

04:06.157 --> 04:07.490
Because it's
important to him,

04:07.492 --> 04:09.225
and when we signed the Roommate
Agreement, we made a deal.

04:09.227 --> 04:12.362
Y-You keep talking like that,
you're gonna make color guard.

04:14.933 --> 04:16.632
(video game sound effects
over TV)

04:16.635 --> 04:18.668
Man, I'm worn out.
I know.

04:18.670 --> 04:21.637
Imagine if we were
actually moving.

04:21.640 --> 04:26.109
No, it's just, ever since I
started dating Claire and Emily

04:26.111 --> 04:29.545
at the same time,
it's exhausting.

04:29.547 --> 04:31.080
You're exhausted?

04:31.082 --> 04:33.383
Try folding every five pages
in a pregnancy book

04:33.385 --> 04:35.718
so your wife thinks you read it.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.421
But, dude, you're so lucky.

04:38.423 --> 04:41.057
Getting to stay home at night
with the woman you love.

04:41.059 --> 04:42.859
I guess I am lucky.

04:42.861 --> 04:46.262
You are, because
dating two women,

04:46.264 --> 04:48.865
I mean, I can't even remember

04:48.867 --> 04:52.468
the last time I slept
in my own apartment.

04:52.470 --> 04:55.838
I wake up and I'm like, "Am I at
Claire's or am I at Emily's?

04:55.840 --> 04:58.107
Is there a third girl
I've forgotten about?"

04:58.109 --> 04:59.609
Like...

04:59.611 --> 05:02.111
"Where am I?"

05:02.113 --> 05:03.579
Hey, Raj.

05:03.581 --> 05:05.348
Hey, how's the mommy-to-be?

05:05.350 --> 05:06.749
Good. A little tired.

05:06.751 --> 05:10.019
I feel you. I've been
dating multiple women.

05:11.056 --> 05:12.121
You sure you don't
want to come

05:12.123 --> 05:13.423
watch <i>Game of</i>
<i>Thrones</i> with us?

05:13.425 --> 05:14.657
You guys have fun.

05:14.659 --> 05:16.159
I'm just gonna snuggle up
in bed with a book.

05:16.161 --> 05:19.629
Oh, that sounds great--
a bed to yourself.

05:19.631 --> 05:22.832
Can't even remember
what that's like.

05:25.170 --> 05:27.603
Are you up-to-date
on <i>Game of Thrones?</i>

05:27.605 --> 05:28.838
Mm, I think so.

05:28.840 --> 05:33.776
Dragons, snow zombies,
and all the hot guys are dead.

05:33.778 --> 05:35.678
Oh, I don't know.

05:35.680 --> 05:36.946
Theon Greyjoy
looks pretty good

05:36.948 --> 05:39.248
for a guy who had his
genitals cut off.

05:42.721 --> 05:44.954
(singsongy): Uh-oh,
somebody's still pouting.

05:44.956 --> 05:46.055
Leave me alone.

05:46.057 --> 05:47.690
If it's because
you lost a stick,

05:47.692 --> 05:49.625
I know where it went.

05:51.463 --> 05:52.662
Not funny.

05:52.664 --> 05:53.896
You know you're gonna
make up with him.

05:53.898 --> 05:55.264
Can we just skip to that part?

05:55.266 --> 05:57.600
Oh, of course, because
I'm the only adult around here.

05:57.602 --> 05:59.135
Really? The only adult?

05:59.137 --> 06:00.937
Yeah, that's right.
SHELDON: You know, excuse me.

06:00.939 --> 06:03.005
Tonight I'll be watching
a show rated M.A.,

06:03.007 --> 06:06.075
and that stands for
"Mature Audiences," buster.

06:06.077 --> 06:08.378
All right, you would
think "the only adult"

06:08.380 --> 06:10.980
wouldn't let something silly
ruin our entire night.

06:10.982 --> 06:13.316
And I'd think you'd understand
why I'm annoyed.

06:13.318 --> 06:16.519
All this could be avoided if
you'd just come to the meeting.

06:16.521 --> 06:17.387
I don't want to.

06:17.389 --> 06:18.388
Oh, it's just a meeting.

06:18.390 --> 06:20.757
One simple meeting.

06:31.703 --> 06:35.638
I'm not sure if I'm hoping
for a boy or a girl.

06:35.640 --> 06:36.906
I mean, if it's a boy,

06:36.908 --> 06:38.975
I'm gonna have to teach him
to play catch.

06:38.977 --> 06:40.543
(chuckles) Which means
I'm gonna have to Google

06:40.545 --> 06:41.811
"How to play catch."

06:43.114 --> 06:46.416
If it's a girl, I mean...

06:46.418 --> 06:50.019
they're so innocent and...
you know how guys are.

06:50.021 --> 06:52.221
Totally, guys are the worst.

06:52.223 --> 06:55.491
I mean, look at me.

06:55.493 --> 06:58.194
I let Emily make me a frittata

06:58.196 --> 07:01.431
and I kept the leftovers
in Claire's fridge that night.

07:01.433 --> 07:03.599
I'm such a dog.

07:06.404 --> 07:07.837
There you go again.

07:07.839 --> 07:10.973
I'm sorry, have I been
complaining about it too much?

07:10.975 --> 07:13.342
Actually, what you're doing is
pretending to complain,

07:13.344 --> 07:14.744
but really trying to brag.

07:14.746 --> 07:16.412
How could you say that?

07:16.414 --> 07:18.714
(imitates Koothrappali): "Oh,
I wish could enjoy a cup of tea

07:18.716 --> 07:22.885
without a naked girl
bouncing up and down on me."

07:22.887 --> 07:25.655
I never said that.

07:25.657 --> 07:28.224
"Don't you hate it when you
can't remember whose bra it is

07:28.226 --> 07:30.793
you found wedged in your couch?"

07:32.664 --> 07:34.730
Okay, that I said.

07:34.732 --> 07:36.766
But that's a real problem!

07:36.768 --> 07:38.634
You give a girl
another woman's bra,

07:38.636 --> 07:41.103
and you will not be
having sex with her that night.

07:41.105 --> 07:42.972
Maybe the other girl,
but not her.

07:50.348 --> 07:51.881
What's going on with him?

07:51.883 --> 07:53.249
Oh, he's all
bent out of shape

07:53.251 --> 07:55.151
about having
a Roommate Agreement meeting.

07:55.153 --> 07:58.754
Apparently, perfect attendance
isn't cool anymore.

07:59.657 --> 08:01.357
Don't worry,
he'll come around.

08:01.359 --> 08:03.192
Well, I get why he's annoyed.

08:03.194 --> 08:05.895
Well, then you don't
understand what's happening.

08:05.897 --> 08:07.530
See...

08:07.532 --> 08:08.764
Leonard refused to participate

08:08.766 --> 08:11.133
in a mandatory quarterly
Roommate Agreement meeting.

08:11.135 --> 08:15.004
This is what a generation raised
on Bart Simpson looks like.

08:15.006 --> 08:16.772
You love <i>The Simpsons.</i>

08:16.774 --> 08:19.942
I love Lisa Simpson.

08:22.113 --> 08:23.946
Well, I know how he feels.

08:23.948 --> 08:26.215
I never enjoyed our
Relationship Agreement meetings.

08:26.217 --> 08:27.917
(gasps) Wait.

08:27.919 --> 08:29.018
You were pretending?

08:29.020 --> 08:31.354
Sorry.

08:31.356 --> 08:32.955
No!

08:32.957 --> 08:35.558
I don't believe you.
I could tell.

08:40.698 --> 08:41.998
"Oh, Sheldon,

08:42.000 --> 08:43.232
"I never thought

08:43.234 --> 08:44.600
"re-filing a matter

08:44.602 --> 08:49.372
in a standing subcommittee
could be so fascinating."

08:51.209 --> 08:55.077
Hmm, what do you think?

08:55.079 --> 08:57.947
You don't know?

09:01.352 --> 09:03.819
Hey, did I say
something to upset you?

09:03.821 --> 09:05.254
No, I'm fine.

09:05.256 --> 09:07.089
Really? Because usually
we walk side by side,

09:07.091 --> 09:09.125
and I just went up
two flights of stairs

09:09.127 --> 09:12.094
staring at your bottom.

09:12.096 --> 09:14.230
Just drop it.

09:14.232 --> 09:16.499
Okay, I think I see
what's happening here.

09:16.501 --> 09:17.767
You're jealous of me.

09:17.769 --> 09:19.001
Oh, please.

09:19.003 --> 09:21.537
What could you possibly have
that I would be jealous of?

09:21.539 --> 09:25.274
It's not what I have, it's how
many people I'm having it with.

09:27.011 --> 09:28.945
Come on, Sheldon, we'll watch
<i>Game of Thrones</i> over here.

09:28.947 --> 09:30.746
Gladly.
LEONARD: Oh, good, go.

09:30.748 --> 09:31.847
You know, it'll be nice

09:31.849 --> 09:33.616
to watch an episode
without someone saying,

09:33.618 --> 09:34.784
"I read the books.

09:34.786 --> 09:37.420
Don't get too fond
of <i>this</i> character."

09:37.422 --> 09:39.655
It's not always
because they die.

09:39.657 --> 09:41.591
In one case, it's because
they've become involved

09:41.593 --> 09:43.492
with underground tree people
from the dawn of time.

09:43.494 --> 09:45.227
Yeah, but I won't
say who it is.

09:45.229 --> 09:46.362
It's Bran!

09:47.765 --> 09:49.732
Wait, what is going on?

09:49.734 --> 09:51.734
Leonard's being a jerk,
so we're gonna watch over here,

09:51.736 --> 09:53.269
Do you guys want
to watch with us?

09:53.271 --> 09:54.870
As long as I don't
have to watch with him.

09:54.872 --> 09:56.505
Fine, I don't want to
watch with you either.

09:56.507 --> 09:57.473
I'll go over here.

09:57.475 --> 09:58.741
Why do you get to pick?

09:58.743 --> 09:59.875
Okay, then you go there!

09:59.877 --> 10:02.244
Don't tell me where to go!

10:02.246 --> 10:03.713
Howard, just come in here.

10:03.715 --> 10:05.481
Yeah, come on, Raj.

10:05.483 --> 10:07.650
Wait, did Amy make
her spinach dip?

10:07.652 --> 10:08.651
She did.

10:08.653 --> 10:10.720
And I'm gonna eat it all!

10:10.722 --> 10:12.888
(door slams)

10:21.231 --> 10:22.864
So what the hell happened?

10:22.866 --> 10:25.167
Oh, I just ran out of patience
with Sheldon's nonsense.

10:25.169 --> 10:27.869
Tell me about it.
I've had it with Raj, too.

10:27.871 --> 10:31.006
You know, like women, men have
a monthly hormone cycle.

10:31.008 --> 10:33.141
Dips in testosterone
can cause irritability.

10:33.143 --> 10:34.643
Interesting.

10:34.645 --> 10:39.414
Maybe my male cycle synced up
with Raj's actual period.

10:41.018 --> 10:44.553
If Sheldon's testosterone
dipped, he'd become a butterfly.

10:44.555 --> 10:45.320
(knocking on door)

10:45.322 --> 10:47.589
Oh.

10:47.591 --> 10:50.459
Maybe someone's here
to apologize.

10:51.295 --> 10:52.995
Hey, Leonard.

10:54.498 --> 10:55.998
Stuart.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.066
Uh...

10:59.803 --> 11:02.571
Is this not a dress-up party?

11:02.573 --> 11:04.339
No.

11:07.011 --> 11:09.311
Was it ever a dress-up party?

11:09.313 --> 11:11.713
No.

11:11.715 --> 11:14.950
Howard, didn't you tell me
it was a dress-up party?

11:14.952 --> 11:17.486
Yeah. (chuckles)

11:20.024 --> 11:22.124
(knocking on door)

11:27.297 --> 11:30.999
I was told this is where to go
if I'm mad at Howard.

11:32.870 --> 11:36.571
May I take your cloak?

11:36.573 --> 11:38.206
Thanks.

11:38.208 --> 11:42.044
This thing kept getting caught
in the chain of my bike.

11:42.046 --> 11:44.379
Well, I'll catch you up.

11:44.381 --> 11:47.382
Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard,
Leonard's angry at me and Penny,

11:47.384 --> 11:49.051
I'm angry at Leonard and Amy,

11:49.053 --> 11:50.619
Raj is angry at Howard,

11:50.621 --> 11:52.821
and I'm angry
at George R.R. Martin

11:52.823 --> 11:55.624
'cause there are no new books
for me to spoil for Leonard.

11:55.626 --> 11:59.394
So what happened
with you and Howard?

11:59.396 --> 12:00.896
Says I was talking too much

12:00.898 --> 12:02.230
about dating Claire and Emily,

12:02.232 --> 12:04.666
and I accused him
of being jealous.

12:04.668 --> 12:06.134
I'm jealous.

12:06.136 --> 12:07.736
Closest I've come
to dating two women

12:07.738 --> 12:10.338
was that time I dated one woman.

12:14.211 --> 12:16.445
I don't know how
<i>you</i> put up with it.

12:16.447 --> 12:18.447
He's impossible.
I mean, holding a meeting

12:18.449 --> 12:21.283
to decide what
breakfast cereal we should buy.

12:21.285 --> 12:24.986
Yeah. Cap'n Crunch
with Crunch Berries, move on.

12:24.988 --> 12:28.890
Anyway, Amy, thank you
for sticking up for me.

12:28.892 --> 12:32.260
Oh, I honestly
couldn't care less.

12:32.262 --> 12:33.995
Sorry?

12:33.997 --> 12:36.298
Well, I just took your side
'cause sometimes I get annoyed

12:36.300 --> 12:37.866
at how close Sheldon
and Penny are.

12:37.868 --> 12:40.869
Well, they argue all the time.

12:40.871 --> 12:42.104
They aren't that close.

12:42.106 --> 12:44.272
Who's always comforting
him when he's upset?

12:44.274 --> 12:46.441
Penny, but...
Who's the only one

12:46.443 --> 12:48.210
who can make him take his
medicine when he's sick?

12:48.212 --> 12:50.178
I try to hide it
in his peanut butter,

12:50.180 --> 12:52.047
but he spits it out.

12:53.851 --> 12:54.850
Okay.

12:54.852 --> 12:56.752
And did you know she
has him add things

12:56.754 --> 12:58.987
to the Roommate Agreement
so she can get her way

12:58.989 --> 13:00.989
and not fight
with you about it?

13:00.991 --> 13:03.258
Son of a bitch.

13:05.095 --> 13:07.229
(laughs)

13:07.231 --> 13:10.265
Why is that funny?

13:10.267 --> 13:12.300
I don't know.
I like the pain of others.

13:12.302 --> 13:14.069
(laughs)

13:14.071 --> 13:16.671
Oh, well,
then you'll enjoy this.

13:16.673 --> 13:19.608
Bernadette does the same thing
with you and Koothrappali.

13:19.610 --> 13:20.575
No, she doesn't.

13:20.577 --> 13:22.477
She defends him all the time.

13:22.479 --> 13:23.779
She does not.

13:23.781 --> 13:25.080
Who told you
to stop making

13:25.082 --> 13:27.215
all those Gandhi
jokes about him?

13:27.217 --> 13:29.885
Well, she did.

13:29.887 --> 13:32.454
And human resources.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.258
Who do you think
told Koothrappali

13:36.260 --> 13:38.126
to go to human resources?

13:39.029 --> 13:41.930
Son of a bitch.

13:41.932 --> 13:43.799
(laughs)

13:43.801 --> 13:46.668
You're right, it feels good.

13:48.372 --> 13:51.840
All right,
it's almost game time.

13:51.842 --> 13:52.808
Get it?

13:52.810 --> 13:55.610
<i>Game of Thrones,</i> game time?

13:57.447 --> 13:59.681
Two women, huh?

14:00.884 --> 14:03.218
<i>(Game of Thrones</i> theme
playing on TV, knocking on door)

14:03.220 --> 14:05.153
Oh, perhaps it's Amy
coming to her senses.

14:05.155 --> 14:06.655
(music stops)

14:06.657 --> 14:08.557
What's up?
You know,

14:08.559 --> 14:10.592
you don't need to use Sheldon
to get your way with me

14:10.594 --> 14:11.827
in a dumb
Roommate Agreement.

14:11.829 --> 14:12.761
Where'd you get that from?

14:12.763 --> 14:13.695
From Amy.

14:13.697 --> 14:16.264
Ugh. Amy, why did you
tell him that?

14:16.266 --> 14:19.434
Because you were defending
Sheldon like you always do.

14:19.436 --> 14:20.769
I don't always
defend Sheldon.

14:20.771 --> 14:22.771
Oh, yes, you do.
You know you have a weird

14:22.773 --> 14:25.774
brother-sister-Elliott-E.T.
relationship with him.

14:25.776 --> 14:28.710
What about your weird
relationship with him?

14:28.712 --> 14:29.744
That's different.

14:29.746 --> 14:31.213
I'm like the little girl
in <i>Poltergeist</i>

14:31.215 --> 14:33.248
and he's the creepy thing
in the TV.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.884
WOLOWITZ:
Um, guys?

14:35.886 --> 14:38.186
Were there any nuts
in that food?

14:38.188 --> 14:40.188
I don't think so. Why?
Well...

14:40.190 --> 14:42.991
just a feeling. (chuckles)

14:52.536 --> 14:54.436
It just said
"Italian sub."

14:54.438 --> 14:57.505
I had no idea mortadella
has pistachios in it.

14:57.507 --> 14:59.774
Interesting fact:

14:59.776 --> 15:04.246
In Italian, the "morta"
in "mortadella" means death.

15:05.849 --> 15:07.749
Sheldon.

15:07.751 --> 15:11.519
I didn't say "fun" fact.
I'm not a monster.

15:11.521 --> 15:13.488
He's gonna be okay.

15:13.490 --> 15:14.356
(all sighing)

15:14.358 --> 15:17.158
Now it's a fun fact.

15:17.160 --> 15:20.595
Boy, stuff like this really
puts things in perspective.

15:20.597 --> 15:22.297
Why are you
dressed like that?

15:22.299 --> 15:25.200
Oh, uh, Howard thought
it'd be funny

15:25.202 --> 15:27.235
to tell me
it was a costume party.

15:27.237 --> 15:28.770
That wasn't nice.

15:28.772 --> 15:32.607
No, but he almost died,
so we're cool.

15:33.944 --> 15:37.178
You know, if you think about it,
tonight was kind of like

15:37.180 --> 15:39.281
a real-life
<i>Game of Thrones.</i>

15:39.283 --> 15:40.282
How?

15:40.284 --> 15:42.617
Well, Howard eating
that pistachio

15:42.619 --> 15:44.786
was like when King
Joffrey got poisoned.

15:44.788 --> 15:47.222
Okay, well, that was murder,
this was an accident.

15:47.224 --> 15:48.189
Okay.

15:48.191 --> 15:50.525
But you using Sheldon

15:50.527 --> 15:53.561
to do your dirty work
is like when Cersei

15:53.563 --> 15:55.297
used the King's Guard
to do her bidding.

15:55.299 --> 15:58.600
Cersei uses her body
to manipulate men.

15:58.602 --> 16:01.369
Penny just takes me
to The LEGO Store.

16:01.371 --> 16:04.806
Okay. Oh, how about this?

16:04.808 --> 16:07.642
Stuart's dressed like a
brother of the Night's Watch,

16:07.644 --> 16:09.477
and they don't have sex.

16:09.479 --> 16:10.478
There you go.
That's true.

16:10.480 --> 16:11.713
Fair enough.

16:12.950 --> 16:14.110
Hey.

16:14.111 --> 16:15.315
Hey.
You all right?

16:15.316 --> 16:16.849
I'm fine.

16:16.851 --> 16:19.384
Just a little embarrassed I had
to be carried down the stairs

16:19.386 --> 16:20.452
like a baby.

16:20.454 --> 16:21.987
Thanks.

16:23.824 --> 16:25.624
Let's get out of here.

16:25.626 --> 16:27.159
That was scary.

16:27.161 --> 16:28.560
Well, the
important thing is

16:28.562 --> 16:30.596
I said that big sandwich
would ruin everything,

16:30.598 --> 16:32.431
and I was right.

16:35.269 --> 16:38.370
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Hey, Jon Snow!

16:38.372 --> 16:41.607
How come your horse
has a basket on it?

16:43.377 --> 16:46.845
How come your head
has your face on it?

16:48.916 --> 16:51.517
They don't wear bicycle helmets
in <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

16:51.519 --> 16:53.585
You're thematically inaccurate,

16:53.587 --> 16:57.289
but I applaud
your commitment to safety.

16:57.291 --> 17:00.325
Don't you guys have anything
better to do?

17:00.327 --> 17:02.694
Better than watching
a guy in a fur cloak

17:02.696 --> 17:06.064
ride a girl's
bike? Nope.

17:06.066 --> 17:09.768
That's it, you just lost
bathroom privileges

17:09.770 --> 17:12.371
at the comic book store.

17:17.344 --> 17:19.411
(muttering): Horse has
a basket on it. Stupid...

17:20.247 --> 17:22.446
(screams, grunts)

17:32.279 --> 17:34.346
(knocks)
SHELDON: Leonard.

17:34.348 --> 17:37.482
(knocks) Leonard.
(knocks) Leonard.

17:37.484 --> 17:39.284
What?

17:39.286 --> 17:42.220
I never got to ask
my question about Batman.

17:44.991 --> 17:46.124
What is it?

17:46.126 --> 17:49.661
If Batman were bitten
by a radioactive Man-Bat,

17:49.663 --> 17:53.365
and then fought crime
disguised as Man-Bat,

17:53.367 --> 17:56.501
would he be
Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man

17:56.503 --> 18:00.171
or simply
Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?

18:02.576 --> 18:06.845
Is he still wearing the Batman
suit under the Man-Bat suit?

18:09.148 --> 18:10.814
I'll be back.
