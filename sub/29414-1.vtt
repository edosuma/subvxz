[man in voiceover]
<i> You're probably wondering</i>
<i>what the hell I'm doing out here</i>

00:27.395 --> 00:28.360
<i> in a 110 degree heat.</i>

00:30.064 --> 00:32.164
<i> I wasn't always so desperate.</i>

00:33.667 --> 00:37.136
<i> At one time I made huge cash</i>
<i> and lived like royalty</i>

00:37.138 --> 00:40.039
<i> as I gambled the nights away</i>
<i> with the Hollywood elite.</i>

00:40.041 --> 00:42.408
[slow music]

00:42.410 --> 00:44.643
<i> I made poker in LA hip</i>

00:44.645 --> 00:47.546
<i> and made every</i>
<i> big hitter scratch</i>
<i>and crawl their way to my game.</i>

00:51.452 --> 00:55.254
<i> Now...</i>
<i> I was the one</i>
<i> doing the crawling.</i>

01:04.832 --> 01:05.764
He looks like shit.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.470
Relax, I just forgot
my sunblock.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.744
[reggae music]

01:18.746 --> 01:22.347
<i> Yeah, I was the king</i>
<i> of Hollywood poker alright.</i>

01:22.349 --> 01:24.516
<i> I thought</i>
<i> it would never end.</i>

01:29.824 --> 01:33.258
<i> My name's Duke Madson.</i>
<i> I was an actor.</i>

01:33.260 --> 01:36.695
<i> At one time</i>
<i> I made good money</i>
<i> in a whole lot of movies.</i>

01:36.697 --> 01:40.532
[pop song]
¶<i> Life is sweet, yay</i>
<i> Under my umbrella</i> ¶

01:40.534 --> 01:45.204
¶<i> Baba baba baraba baba</i>
<i> Baba Baba baba baraba</i> ¶

01:48.776 --> 01:51.443
[Duke]
<i> After Hollywood spit me out,</i>

01:51.445 --> 01:55.781
<i> I scraped by doing</i>
<i> pitch work and other</i>
<i> hack jobs to make a buck.</i>

01:58.385 --> 02:01.420
Hey! You wanna see
what else this mop can do?

02:01.422 --> 02:04.590
[audience cheering] Yeah!

02:04.592 --> 02:06.592
[camera beep]
[man]
Emphasis off the "can."

02:06.594 --> 02:08.727
Like what?
Give me a reading.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.829
[man]
"Wanna see what else
this mop can do?" Action!

02:10.831 --> 02:14.633
Hey!
You wanna see
what else this mop...? Hey!

02:14.635 --> 02:16.635
[man] "You wanna see
what else this mop can do?"

02:16.637 --> 02:18.770
[man 2] That was nice.
[man 3] He's been drinking.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.207
[man] I'd like to zoom in after.
[man 2] I'd like to zoom out.

02:22.209 --> 02:24.143
[man] And action!
You know what?

02:24.145 --> 02:26.378
You wanna hear other things?
[man] Set.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.715
[man] You're doing "And..."
Okay, come on. Can do!

02:29.717 --> 02:32.217
[man] Keep your body still.
And action!

02:32.219 --> 02:35.654
This does everything.
It'll scratch your back.
It'll put you there.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.457
You put the fucking thing
in the water.
Who gives a shit?

02:38.459 --> 02:41.660
Let's hear some other
things this mop can do!

02:41.662 --> 02:42.794
[audience] Oh...

02:45.900 --> 02:49.535
[Duke]
<i> After that was over,</i>
<i> I was broke and desperate.</i>

02:49.537 --> 02:53.605
<i> To support my family,</i>
<i> I started up what I knew best:</i>

02:53.607 --> 02:54.907
<i> A poker game.</i>

02:57.244 --> 02:59.411
<i> Back then,</i>
<i> I had my regular crew.</i>

03:00.347 --> 03:02.648
Okay, are we
having fun yet, huh?

03:02.650 --> 03:04.183
Here we go.
Nickel, nickel ante.

03:04.185 --> 03:07.352
[Duke]
<i> It was five card draw.</i>
<i> Seven card stud.</i>

03:07.354 --> 03:09.821
<i> And, of course,</i>
<i> Texas hold 'em.</i>

03:11.425 --> 03:13.192
<i> There was</i>
<i> Danny, The Magician.</i>

03:13.194 --> 03:17.729
<i> He'd come</i>
<i> in his beat up magician's</i>
<i> outfit, top hat and all.</i>

03:17.731 --> 03:20.199
<i> He was also</i>
<i> a terrible player.</i>

03:21.635 --> 03:23.635
Go ahead, Midge,
it's on you.

03:23.637 --> 03:27.739
Don't call me Midge,
I'm a little person
With a big cock.

03:27.741 --> 03:32.778
[Duke]<i> That was Bobby Sanders.</i>
<i> AKA Peanut. A former</i>
<i> jockey at Santa Anita.</i>

03:32.780 --> 03:35.380
And, hey, can I get
a pillow for this chair?

03:35.382 --> 03:38.817
I feel like I'm sitting
in a fucking coffin.
Jesus Christ!

03:38.819 --> 03:42.487
[man] He's nervous for a jockey.
[Duke]<i> My crazy brother Carl.</i>

03:42.489 --> 03:46.558
[Duke]<i> Carl used to be</i>
<i> a top publicist in Hollywood</i>
<i> until he screwed that up.</i>

03:46.560 --> 03:51.363
<i> He was a two-bit hustler,</i>
<i> to be honest. He was also</i>
<i> an incessant namedropper.</i>

03:51.365 --> 03:53.632
Did I tell you guys I used
to play strip poker

03:53.634 --> 03:54.967
with Hugh Hefner
at the Playboy mansion?

03:54.969 --> 03:56.969
[man] Ay...

03:56.970 --> 03:58.970
But the Playmates were naked
from the beginning.
It defeated the purpose.

03:58.973 --> 04:01.740
[man] You're told
to have stories already.
They're very bright.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.276
[Duke]<i> And then there was Wing.</i>
Two hundred for me.

04:04.278 --> 04:07.246
[Duke]<i> He was a harmless</i>
<i> action guy I met years ago</i>
<i> at the racetrack.</i>

04:07.248 --> 04:09.548
<i> He was</i>
<i> the happiest loser</i>
<i> I ever met.</i>

04:11.619 --> 04:13.852
Smoked me like Korean barbecue.
[man] Abracadabra!

04:13.854 --> 04:17.990
[Duke]<i> But the secret</i>
<i> to my game was to keep</i>
<i> everybody happy.</i>

04:19.593 --> 04:22.794
<i> And what a game!</i>
<i> Over the years</i>
<i> it got bigger and better.</i>

04:22.796 --> 04:25.397
<i> We were playing</i>
<i> two to three times a week.</i>

04:25.399 --> 04:28.000
<i> Players were</i>
<i> coming out</i>
<i> of the woodwork.</i>

04:28.002 --> 04:31.503
<i> My beautiful wife KC</i>
<i> would work the phones</i>
<i> like a car salesman.</i>

04:31.505 --> 04:33.538
Curt, are you in
or are you out?
I need to know.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.807
[Duke]<i> I knew</i>
<i> every trick and nuance</i>
<i> from the start.</i>

04:35.809 --> 04:38.810
<i> When to bet,</i>
<i> when to bluff, and how</i>
<i> to read their tells.</i>

04:38.812 --> 04:42.748
Hey, KC, when the new guy
has a big hand, he twitches.
Write that down.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.684
Okay.
And Danny the Magician. Huh?

04:45.686 --> 04:48.820
When he's bluffing, he yawns.
It's a horrible tell.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.390
Got it. Here we go.
He's crushing it!

04:52.926 --> 04:55.327
We're gonna play a round
of hold 'em but limit.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.062
[Duke]<i> I was the ring leader.</i>

04:57.064 --> 05:01.400
<i> A friend, a drinking buddy,</i>
<i> and a banker.</i>

05:01.402 --> 05:03.935
Gentlemen!
[Duke]<i> Money was rolling in.</i>

05:07.441 --> 05:09.007
<i> Then came</i>
<i> my friend Sandor.</i>

05:09.009 --> 05:12.944
You wanna say it's carnival?
Let's dance. Let's dance.

05:12.946 --> 05:17.015
[Duke]<i> Sandor was a compulsive</i>
<i> gambler who came from a rich</i>
<i> South American family.</i>

05:17.651 --> 05:20.686
<i> Rumor was</i>
<i> his mother would send him</i>
<i> a million dollars every year,</i>

05:20.688 --> 05:24.489
<i> and by year's end,</i>
<i> he'd always gambled it away.</i>

05:26.493 --> 05:28.660
<i> Another thing</i>
<i> that made this game great</i>

05:28.662 --> 05:31.830
<i> was there was always</i>
<i> some kind of crazy prop bet.</i>

05:31.832 --> 05:34.366
[Duke]<i> Props were side bets.</i>
Wait a minute, I won.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.935
<i> We bet thousands</i>
<i> on all kinds of stuff.</i>
<i> You name it.</i>

05:38.038 --> 05:41.807
Oh! Oh! Get off me!
[men laughing]

05:41.809 --> 05:44.109
[man] He's gonna lose it.
[man 2] Thirty seconds left!

05:44.111 --> 05:46.778
Thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen!

05:46.780 --> 05:50.682
You're gonna make it!
[Duke] Okay, great, back up.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.652
[men] Go back, go back.
Fuck you! Be specific!

05:53.654 --> 05:56.988
Your right, your right!
[man] He's gonna kill himself!

05:56.990 --> 06:00.092
No, no, no, no, no!

06:03.864 --> 06:05.897
[man] Damn it!
The little runt did it!

06:05.899 --> 06:13.405
[Duke]<i> All in all, we were</i>
<i> happy. We were out of debt.</i>
<i> Things were beautiful.</i>

06:15.809 --> 06:18.043
Hundred.
[bell ringing]
I'll go.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.612
[Duke]
<i> Then... it happened.</i>

06:20.614 --> 06:22.013
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:22.015 --> 06:25.050
[Duke]<i> A holdup.</i>
Holy...
Fuck!

06:25.052 --> 06:29.020
Put the fucking cash
on the table!
Now, assholes, now!

06:29.022 --> 06:30.956
[Duke]<i> He took us</i>
<i> for everything.</i>
Gosh!

06:31.792 --> 06:35.026
<i> KC had had enough.</i>
<i> We had to move the game.</i>

06:35.829 --> 06:37.462
<i> Beverly Hills.</i>

06:38.832 --> 06:42.467
<i> Swimming pools,</i>
<i> movie stars.</i>

06:44.772 --> 06:48.840
<i> I found this</i>
<i> perfect spot in the back room</i>
<i> of the Cuba Club.</i>

06:49.610 --> 06:51.777
What do you think?
This will do.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.047
[Duke]<i> With KC by my side,</i>
<i> the game exploded.</i>

06:56.049 --> 06:59.084
<i> It became</i>
<i> the biggest underground</i>
<i> game in the city.</i>

07:00.554 --> 07:05.457
<i> Doctors, lawyers,</i>
<i> B-level celebrities.</i>
<i>Nobody could play worth a damn.</i>

07:05.459 --> 07:07.793
Hey, hey, how are you?
What have I missed so far?

07:07.795 --> 07:10.762
[Duke]<i> Like this big guy</i>
<i> across the table from me,</i>
<i> a local attorney.</i>

07:10.764 --> 07:12.531
Sounds about right.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.167
Duke, Rob McNeely, brother!
Nice to meet you, man.

07:15.169 --> 07:17.803
[Duke]<i> Who I found out quickly</i>
<i> loved to crush your hand.</i>

07:17.805 --> 07:20.539
<i> From that day on,</i>
<i> I called him "Squeeze."</i>

07:20.541 --> 07:22.741
Ready? Right card.

07:23.544 --> 07:26.812
[Duke]<i> Carl would hit up</i>
<i> the new marks</i>
<i> with old school con games.</i>

07:26.814 --> 07:29.681
<i> KC hosted,</i>
<i> did the books.</i>

07:29.683 --> 07:34.052
<i> The stakes got</i>
<i> naturally higher,</i>
<i> and so did my winnings.</i>

07:38.559 --> 07:41.793
<i> I was winning</i>
<i> so much cash, we had</i>
<i> to bury it in the back yard.</i>

07:42.763 --> 07:45.797
[KC] Watch my fingers.
Watch my fingers! Ow!

07:45.799 --> 07:47.966
[Duke]<i> Then a few years later,</i>
<i> the poker boom hit.</i>

07:49.169 --> 07:51.069
That guy just bet
a million with nothing!

07:51.071 --> 07:52.804
[Duke]<i> It was all over TV.</i>

07:53.907 --> 07:56.208
<i> And everyone wanted</i>
<i> to play my game.</i>

08:01.615 --> 08:05.116
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to meet Sebastian.
Good luck.

08:06.753 --> 08:10.922
[Duke]<i> Sebastian Salter,</i>
<i> the hottest young</i>
<i> director in Hollywood.</i>

08:10.924 --> 08:13.258
<i> Humble,</i>
<i> compassionate, unassuming.</i>

08:13.260 --> 08:16.061
<i> These were qualities</i>
<i> Sebastian would never have.</i>

08:17.130 --> 08:20.499
How're you doing?
I'm Duke. I run the game.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.536
I know who you are.
You're the pitch guy, huh...

08:24.538 --> 08:28.106
You sell catheters and diapers
and all that shit.
You're very talented.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.775
Glad you enjoy
the products.

08:30.777 --> 08:33.245
[Duke]<i> I knew</i>
<i> this guy was gonna be trouble.</i>

08:33.247 --> 08:35.747
[Duke]<i> But I also knew</i>
<i> he'd be good for the game.</i>

08:35.749 --> 08:36.948
Yo, Sebastian.

08:36.950 --> 08:42.187
I'm Carl, Duke's brother.
How're you doing, man?
Big fan.

08:43.524 --> 08:46.091
I used to be a publicist.
I handled Stallone...

08:46.093 --> 08:49.694
Oh, you handled Sly,
did you?
No, Frank.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.863
Anyway, welcome
to the game, man.
Big fan, big fan!

08:52.599 --> 08:54.566
Yeah, yeah. Okay.
Good to see you.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.841
Check.
This might
break your heart.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.311
Too easy,
this is too easy.

09:06.914 --> 09:10.015
[Duke]<i> This guy was good.</i>
I thought I was with real men.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.850
[Duke]<i> And I mean very good.</i>

09:12.619 --> 09:16.054
What was that,
third hand tonight?
Here, sweetheart.

09:24.798 --> 09:29.267
Hey!
Hey, Pitchman. Am I good?

09:29.269 --> 09:33.605
Yeah. Sit down. Sit down.
Relax. Nice win.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.608
Nice win. What?
About ten grand?

09:36.610 --> 09:39.244
Eleven actually,
but who's counting?

09:39.246 --> 09:42.013
It's barely enough
to cover a weekend
in Turks and Caicos.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.750
But, I like this,
and I like what you've
done with the place.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.003
This is fun.
I like it a lot.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.255
Man, well, you should,
you're a good player.
You've been playing a long time?

09:51.191 --> 09:55.260
Mm... Six months.
Yeah, about six months.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.263
Yeah, I've got
a photographic memory.

09:58.265 --> 10:03.935
IQ of 175. I don't brag about it
too much, but it's important
that you should know.

10:05.138 --> 10:08.607
I watched a lot of poker
on TV, I learned,
now I'm basically pro level.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.109
Nobody likes a bragger.

10:13.080 --> 10:18.316
Anyway, enough about me.
How about you? How'd you feel
about my being here?

10:18.318 --> 10:21.219
I don't want to make you
uncomfortable having
a ringer at the table.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.322
It's your game.
No, you're not. You're fine.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.925
You're in the game.
It's nice to hear.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.194
It's nice to hear
'cause I've got a plan.

10:29.196 --> 10:32.163
I say we get rid
of all these amateur fucks.

10:32.165 --> 10:35.734
I mean ruin 'em. Take 'em
to the fucking cleaners.
You know what I mean?

10:35.736 --> 10:40.305
Put 'em out on the streets.
Put down a lot of good money,
you and me.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.041
All we gotta do is
get rid of the good players.

10:43.043 --> 10:47.045
Wait. Slow down. Okay?
I can't get rid of my friends
because they win, you know?

10:47.047 --> 10:49.314
Ah!
Just one of my rules.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.150
Also we don't
rake here, you know?

10:52.152 --> 10:54.719
We quit at two o'clock
and we never
cherry pick the players.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.688
We have a friendly
poker game.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.224
I get it.
I'll be your soldier, brother.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.960
I'll be fucking Tom Hanks
in Private Ryan,
you know what I mean?

11:01.962 --> 11:03.895
Only better looking.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.965
[Duke]
<i> After just a few hours</i>
<i> with this blowhard,</i>

11:06.967 --> 11:10.769
<i> where all he did</i>
<i> was brag and talk about</i>
<i> his new found poker idols,</i>

11:10.771 --> 11:13.838
<i> Doyle Brunson, Puggy Pearson</i>
<i> and Amarillo Slim...</i>

11:13.840 --> 11:17.075
Now, come on, Puggy Pearson
gave Doyle Brunson
the same bet in the eighties.

11:17.077 --> 11:20.111
Those guys were
out of fucking control.
That's when men were men.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.380
[Duke]
<i> ....who he always misquoted.</i>

11:22.382 --> 11:25.150
[Sebastian]
<i> "If you can't spot a sailor</i>
<i> at the table, you're it."</i>

11:25.152 --> 11:27.819
[Duke]
<i> Then he started bragging</i>
<i> about other things.</i>

11:27.821 --> 11:30.188
Did I tell you
I was a black belt
in karate?

11:30.190 --> 11:33.825
Ay!
[Duke] <i> This guy was a nut bag.</i>

11:33.827 --> 11:38.229
[Duke]<i> And as we say in poker,</i>
<i> I was priced in,</i>
<i> and I had to see the flaw.</i>

11:48.141 --> 11:51.376
[Duke]<i> With Sebastian playing,</i>
<i> he brought in</i>
<i> some high rolling friends,</i>

11:51.378 --> 11:56.748
<i> like Angry Jim, who was</i>
<i> in the meat packing industry.</i>
<i> Or something like that.</i>

11:58.385 --> 12:01.786
Hey,
assholes, help push
the chips over here.

12:01.788 --> 12:04.956
You want me
to throw you down
a flight of fucking stairs?

12:04.958 --> 12:07.258
I'll do it,
you motherfuckers.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.761
[Duke]<i> All I know is,</i>
<i> you didn't mess</i>
<i> with this guy.</i>

12:10.764 --> 12:12.430
[Duke]<i> Then there was</i>
<i> Puppet Hank,</i>

12:12.432 --> 12:15.433
<i> who made millions years ago</i>
<i> in the dot com business.</i>

12:15.435 --> 12:17.502
[Duke]<i> He was a wannabe</i>
<i> ventriloquist</i>

12:17.504 --> 12:20.171
<i> who never went anywhere</i>
<i> without his creepy puppet.</i>

12:20.173 --> 12:23.475
[Duke]<i> But when he'd</i>
<i> go broke, he'd go</i>
<i> a little Tourette's.</i>

12:23.477 --> 12:24.409
Fuck you!

12:26.113 --> 12:28.379
What did he say?
I didn't say shit.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.950
This one said, "Fuck you."
Hank, put the puppet away. Okay?

12:31.952 --> 12:36.087
Relax. Get some therapy.
Alright. Fuck you, fuck you,

12:36.089 --> 12:40.792
bitch, bastard, bitch, bastard,
fucking shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, fuck you...

12:40.794 --> 12:43.995
[Duke]<i> With Sebastian in,</i>
<i> things were going great.</i>

12:43.997 --> 12:48.133
[Duke]<i> He even livened</i>
<i> things up by giving Carl</i>
<i> an interesting free role.</i>

12:48.135 --> 12:53.471
[Carl] Who's got the black Audi?
[laughs]

12:53.473 --> 12:55.006
Fuck, man!

12:55.475 --> 12:58.977
Hey! Three more months,
twinkle toes!

13:00.080 --> 13:03.047
If you come anywhere
without wearing your D-cup,
it's off.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.850
[Duke]
<i> My crazy brother Carl.</i>

13:05.852 --> 13:10.555
<i> For fifty thousand,</i>
<i> he had to dress in drag</i>
<i> for three months. Pathetic.</i>

13:10.557 --> 13:16.327
[reggae music]

13:17.364 --> 13:21.900
¶<i> Yeah, na boy, na ¶</i>

13:21.902 --> 13:24.302
¶<i> Okay,</i>
<i> Don't need no introduction</i> ¶

13:24.304 --> 13:26.204
[Duke]<i> As the game grew,</i>
<i> it was very clear.</i>

13:27.440 --> 13:28.973
<i> Sebastian was a winner.</i>

13:28.975 --> 13:31.209
How can you
fucking call that? Hm?

13:31.211 --> 13:33.578
[Duke]
<i> But I was the one player</i>
<i> he couldn't beat.</i>

13:35.282 --> 13:37.215
Lucky son of a bitch.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.284
[Duke]<i> And he hated me</i>
<i> because of it.</i>

13:41.421 --> 13:44.455
[Duke]<i> As time went by,</i>
<i> we took lots</i>
<i> of gambling trips together.</i>

13:44.457 --> 13:47.859
<i> Cabo, Vegas, Miami.</i>

13:48.428 --> 13:50.929
<i> But then we always</i>
<i> came back to the golf.</i>

13:51.865 --> 13:53.531
<i> Chucky Burns.</i>

13:55.001 --> 13:57.602
<i> Television star,</i>
<i> drug addict, drunk...</i>

13:57.604 --> 13:59.604
<i> But just</i>
<i> a sweetheart of a guy.</i>

13:59.606 --> 14:02.574
He has no idea.
I haven't
been outside for days.

14:02.576 --> 14:05.543
Yeah?
That's great. Alright,
we got a four-way scramble,

14:05.545 --> 14:08.379
three ways with the cube.
I got Chucky.

14:08.381 --> 14:13.117
I'll take Puppet Hank,
Sandor, and Carly,
2000 a man. What do you say?

14:13.119 --> 14:16.454
No, you're not taking Carly.
She's playing on for six.
I want her on my side.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.489
[Duke] Okay,
I'll take Squeeze then.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.158
You take Squeeze,
but stop coning me.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.493
I'm not coning you.
You're taking a piss.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.262
Stop it.
Okay, I'll take drag boy then.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.431
Nobody's taking drag boy.
Carly's staying with me.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.900
[Duke] Puppet Hank.
Put down the puppet.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.969
You have to put that...
You're on my team.
He's...

14:30.971 --> 14:33.004
Put it down.
He's caddying me.
You can't have him.

14:33.006 --> 14:36.441
I got him.
Fucking no.
Carly, you're gonna caddie me.

14:36.443 --> 14:39.510
Carly now?
Don't make me
punch you in the vulva!

14:39.512 --> 14:40.578
[Duke] Ah, easy!

14:45.252 --> 14:48.152
I hit the tits off of that one!
I hit the tits off of that one!

14:48.154 --> 14:49.954
[Carl laughing]

14:49.956 --> 14:52.090
Well, he just ruined tits
for me the rest of my life.

14:53.560 --> 14:58.463
[Duke] <i> We'd play all day.</i>
<i> Eighteen, sometimes</i>
<i> 36 holes in one afternoon.</i>

14:58.465 --> 15:00.665
<i> Action bets on everything.</i>

15:01.635 --> 15:04.402
Give me your best shots,
bitches.
Fire!

15:04.404 --> 15:07.238
[Duke]<i> Like the five grand,</i>
<i> hit the sucker bet</i>
<i> for fifty yards out,</i>

15:07.240 --> 15:10.174
<i> where our group had</i>
<i> two minutes</i>
<i> to hurt our victim.</i>

15:15.181 --> 15:16.047
Yeah!

15:16.049 --> 15:19.450
[moaning in pain]

15:22.289 --> 15:24.155
[Duke]<i> After golf,</i>
<i> we'd pay off the rangers.</i>

15:24.157 --> 15:27.292
Gentlemen!
[Duke] <i> Squeeze always insisted.</i>

15:27.294 --> 15:29.093
[Squeeze]
Thanks for your troubles.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.029
Ah!

15:32.299 --> 15:33.932
Don't worry,
I didn't forget you.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.400
Oh! Jesus!

15:35.402 --> 15:38.269
Be good, now.
Thank you. Fuck.

15:43.677 --> 15:46.344
[Duke]<i> Then,</i>
<i> it was payoff time.</i>

15:48.481 --> 15:50.348
[Duke]<i> Afterwards,</i>
<i> the real laughs came</i>

15:50.350 --> 15:53.418
<i> when the guys got drunk</i>
<i> and made stupid prop bets,</i>

15:53.420 --> 15:57.188
<i> like the time</i>
<i> Angry Jim and Sebastian</i>
<i> bet 25 grand each</i>

15:57.190 --> 16:00.358
<i> that the new golf caddie</i>
<i> could eat 50 donuts</i>
<i> in one hour.</i>

16:00.360 --> 16:04.529
And if you don't eat it,
I'm gonna fucking
stuff 'em up your ass!

16:04.531 --> 16:06.965
[Duke]<i> It was</i>
<i> an impossible feat.</i>

16:06.967 --> 16:10.702
[Duke]<i> About a half hour in</i>
<i> and 25 donuts down...</i>

16:10.704 --> 16:14.472
Atta boy, you...
Don't you fucking
hurl on me!

16:14.474 --> 16:17.742
[Duke]<i> The poor kid turned</i>
<i> green and ran out the place</i>
<i> to take his one barf rule.</i>

16:18.678 --> 16:22.647
[Duke]<i> But he</i>
<i> returned quickly,</i>
<i> and to everyone's surprise,</i>

16:22.649 --> 16:26.551
<i> the kid ate</i>
<i> the other 25</i>
<i> and won the bet!</i>

16:26.553 --> 16:28.720
Beautiful! Beautiful!

16:28.722 --> 16:30.521
[Duke]<i> Found out</i>
<i> a couple months later,</i>

16:30.523 --> 16:32.657
<i> the caddie had</i>
<i> an identical twin brother.</i>

16:34.594 --> 16:37.395
[Duke]<i> Angry and Sebastian</i>
<i> set us up to perfection.</i>

16:38.298 --> 16:43.001
[Duke]<i> You had to watch</i>
<i> these guys. You never knew</i>
<i> who was coning who.</i>

16:45.372 --> 16:50.408
Boys, I had
my first cigar at five
and first piece of ass at ten.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.410
Was it consensual?

16:52.412 --> 16:55.313
[men laughing]
Yeah, your mom said it was okay.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.548
Got you!
Carly, close your legs.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.284
I can see your balls
by your knees. Disgusting.

17:00.286 --> 17:06.357
Listen. I've got an idea.
Walk to Vegas
in seven days... A mil.

17:06.793 --> 17:09.627
[men whistling]
Walk to Vegas? That's...

17:10.630 --> 17:12.096
Million dollars.
Interesting.

17:12.098 --> 17:15.400
Amarillo Slim
and Doyle Brunson.
Yeah.

17:15.402 --> 17:18.669
He laid down a bet
forty years ago.
Forty years.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.205
No one here can do it.
I'm certainly not doing it.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.707
Come on.
Prove me wrong.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.276
Listen. It's easy
to figure out. Forty miles.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.812
Yeah.
A day.
Because it's 280 miles.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.547
No. It can't be done.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.785
It's more like nine days,
maybe ten.
Or eleven.

17:33.787 --> 17:38.256
Eleven! You can't
do that in seven days.
It's impossible, unwinnable.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.591
Forget it. I'm not doing it.
Me, neither. No chance.

17:40.593 --> 17:44.262
I'd be lucky to walk to the car.
[men laughing]

17:44.264 --> 17:47.765
[Duke]<i> But later that night,</i>
<i> Sebastian showed</i>
<i> his true colors.</i>

17:51.137 --> 17:55.206
[Duke]<i> When he took Sandor</i>
<i> back to his house</i>
<i> and beat him for 250 grand.</i>

18:04.717 --> 18:06.484
[laughing]

18:07.654 --> 18:10.088
[Duke]<i> I found out</i>
<i> about it a few days later.</i>

18:10.824 --> 18:14.258
Oh, come on,
you're acting
like a little bitch.

18:14.260 --> 18:19.197
I told you, Sebastian,
don't hijack my players,
especially my friend Sandor!

18:19.199 --> 18:21.232
He's a grown man.
He knew what he was doing.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.701
What's a fucking goat
doing here?
I asked for a camel.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.803
You broke the guy
when he was
stone cold drunk!

18:25.805 --> 18:28.539
No one's heard from him in days!
[Sebastian]<i> I don't know.</i>

18:28.541 --> 18:31.809
<i> Maybe he's gone back</i>
<i> to South America, scrounging</i>
<i> another mil off his mother.</i>

18:31.811 --> 18:34.245
I mean, the point is,
it's not my fault.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.682
As the great hustler
Amarillo Slim used to say,

18:37.684 --> 18:39.884
"all is fair
in a snake pit," Dukey.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.520
[Duke] No, no, he said,
"I'll put a rattlesnake
in your pocket

18:42.522 --> 18:44.555
and I'll ask for a match,"
you moron!

18:48.461 --> 18:50.595
Alright, you ask me,
we go the car,
we get a golf club,

18:50.597 --> 18:52.463
and we pay that creep
a visit right now.

18:54.534 --> 18:55.633
Relax, Carl.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.503
[Duke whispering] Golf club
and a car. Psycho.

19:01.174 --> 19:05.543
[Duke]<i> Carl was especially mad</i>
<i>at Sebastian due to a situation</i>
<i> a few days before.</i>

19:07.313 --> 19:08.246
Redheads.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.750
I've always been into redheads.

19:14.554 --> 19:17.922
Well, too bad for you.
'Cause I'm not a redhead!

19:19.225 --> 19:20.224
Got you.

19:20.226 --> 19:23.694
[Duke]<i> That little incident</i>
<i> cost Carl fifty grand.</i>

19:23.696 --> 19:26.564
[Duke]
<i> Sebastian stiffed him</i>
<i> on a technicality.</i>

19:29.469 --> 19:33.337
[Duke]<i> As the years went by,</i>
<i> the game shifted to mansions,</i>
<i>hotels... Went to another level.</i>

19:38.178 --> 19:39.844
[Duke]<i> My winning streak</i>
<i> continued.</i>

19:39.846 --> 19:46.250
[Duke]<i> I kept hiding most</i>
<i> of our cash in the backyard.</i>
<i> Just in case of the unknown.</i>

19:50.490 --> 19:53.724
[Duke]<i> Then we were playing</i>
<i> in this mansion</i>
<i> in some day game</i>

19:53.726 --> 19:56.227
<i> a couple of days</i>
<i> before Thanksgiving.</i>

19:56.229 --> 19:58.796
[Duke]<i> We were supposed</i>
<i> to quit that night,</i>
<i> but Walter Brooks,</i>

19:58.798 --> 20:02.800
<i> a wealthy billionaire</i>
<i> friend of Sebastian's,</i>
<i> was just getting started.</i>

20:03.836 --> 20:05.770
[Duke]<i> Brooks was one</i>
<i> of the most successful</i>

20:05.772 --> 20:07.872
<i> diamond field</i>
<i> and hedge fund owners.</i>

20:08.708 --> 20:12.710
[Duke]<i> He was down</i>
<i> over 200 grand that day,</i>
<i> and he didn't blink an eye.</i>

20:12.712 --> 20:16.280
I'll buy another fifty, please.
Me, too.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.749
[Duke]<i> Then there was</i>
<i> Chucky Burns.</i>

20:18.751 --> 20:22.486
[Duke]<i> The drunken,</i>
<i> drug-addicted sitcom star</i>
<i> having his own struggles.</i>

20:28.261 --> 20:31.562
[Duke]<i> This was</i>
<i> the game of games.</i>
<i> The perfect storm.</i>

20:31.564 --> 20:34.665
[Duke]<i> The problem was</i>
<i> we played right</i>
<i> into Thanksgiving Day,</i>

20:34.667 --> 20:36.801
<i> and no one</i>
<i> had any thoughts of leaving.</i>

20:37.470 --> 20:39.937
[KC]<i> You know that we are</i>
<i> four hours away</i>
<i> from people arriving.</i>

20:39.939 --> 20:42.673
[KC]<i> Where the hell are you?</i>
I'm killing it here.

20:42.675 --> 20:46.010
I'm in the greatest
game of all time! This could
change our entire life!

20:46.012 --> 20:49.647
If you don't get home soon,
I'm gonna change
your entire life!

20:49.649 --> 20:51.649
[whispering] No! No, get out.

20:59.659 --> 21:02.760
[Duke]<i> Chucky lost a record</i>
<i> seven hundred thousand.</i>

21:06.266 --> 21:08.399
[Duke]
<i> I won two hundred</i>
<i> and fifty thousand of it.</i>

21:11.404 --> 21:13.638
[Duke]<i> The biggest score</i>
<i> of my entire life.</i>

21:15.908 --> 21:18.276
[Duke]<i> A few weeks later,</i>
<i> Angry Jim came by</i>

21:18.278 --> 21:22.413
<i> to pick up money I owed</i>
<i> him from a boxing bet,</i>
<i> about 10 grand.</i>

21:29.022 --> 21:30.721
[sighing]

21:31.524 --> 21:33.891
You made me come out
to the San Fernando Valley.

21:33.893 --> 21:38.462
You know they got
poison gases out here
that the government covers up.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.931
Oh,
by the way, did you hear?

21:40.933 --> 21:43.501
That actor prick, Chucky?

21:43.503 --> 21:46.470
His check bounced.
Yeah I know,
I know. Mine too.

21:46.472 --> 21:49.874
He owes me two fifty.
Don't worry about him.
He's very good for it.

21:49.876 --> 21:55.413
Yeah. Well if he's not,
I'm gonna rip out his eyes
and rape his fuckin' skull.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.582
A little much?
Maybe.

21:59.552 --> 22:00.618
My blood sugar's low.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.655
[Duke] Is that Carl?
[groaning]

22:06.893 --> 22:11.028
[groaning]
Carl! What happened?

22:11.030 --> 22:12.997
Carl! Oh!
What happened?

22:12.999 --> 22:15.766
They took my car.
They accused me of cheating.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.468
Who? Who accused
you of cheating?

22:17.470 --> 22:19.937
The Mexicans,
in the Calexico game!

22:21.407 --> 22:23.374
They said
I had phony dice!
Did you?

22:24.444 --> 22:26.510
Duke! That's out of line!
Out of line!

22:26.512 --> 22:29.647
How stupid do I look?
[Duke]<i> That meant "yes."</i>

22:29.649 --> 22:33.451
[Duke]<i> For years Carl</i>
<i> would run down to this</i>
<i> border town game in Calexico</i>

22:33.453 --> 22:37.688
<i> in the back of a seedy bar</i>
<i> and roll dice</i>
<i> with scum bags and gangsters.</i>

22:37.690 --> 22:39.457
[Duke]
<i> It was just a matter of time.</i>

22:39.459 --> 22:42.026
Anyway, they took me out
back in the alley.

22:42.028 --> 22:45.029
Threw hot sauce
in my eyes. Hot sauce!

22:45.031 --> 22:47.832
And then the last thing
I remember,
they're beating my knee.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.067
Look at this.
Beating my knee
with a frying pan.

22:50.069 --> 22:54.038
[Angry] Frying pan?
Fucking Mexicans.
Always thinking of food.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.941
[Angry laughing] Okay, alright.
That's not funny.

22:58.111 --> 23:01.679
Hey.
Can you pay this guy?
They took my whole roll.

23:01.681 --> 23:04.382
Yeah. Yeah.
No, I got it. I got it.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.016
[Angry] I got you covered.
[Carl] My God!

23:06.018 --> 23:07.885
Can I stay for supper?
[Angry] Here you go.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.688
I'm starving.

23:10.690 --> 23:14.058
[Duke]<i> From that day on,</i>
<i> my brother walked on sticks.</i>

23:15.762 --> 23:19.897
<i> About a month later,</i>
<i> Walter Brooks flew us all out</i>
<i> to his Napa Valley vineyard.</i>

23:19.899 --> 23:24.568
<i> It was to celebrate</i>
<i>this new fancy wine he acquired</i>
<i> for a zillion dollars</i> .

23:26.172 --> 23:30.107
<i> We were all having</i>
<i> a blast, higher</i>
<i> than the state of Colorado,</i>

23:30.109 --> 23:32.710
<i> before the temple</i>
<i> of doom cornered me.</i>

23:33.079 --> 23:36.514
That actor prick Chucky...
He still hasn't paid me.

23:36.516 --> 23:38.616
I know, I know, Angry.
He's good for it.

23:38.618 --> 23:42.453
Oh, man.
Fucking pisses me off!
Bad debts ruin games.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.522
You know
what I ought to do?

23:44.524 --> 23:47.124
I ought to throw
that cocksucker down
a fucking flight of stairs!

23:47.126 --> 23:49.627
Easy, Godfather.
He'll pay.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.830
[Duke]<i> I sounded confident,</i>
<i> but I was owed</i>
<i> a lot of money, too.</i>

23:52.832 --> 23:54.732
[Duke]
<i> Chucky was back in rehab.</i>

23:55.435 --> 23:57.935
[man whistling]
[clinking glass]

23:57.937 --> 24:01.138
[applause]

24:02.608 --> 24:04.141
Thank you,
thank you, one and all.

24:05.445 --> 24:08.646
[Walter] I want to begin
by welcoming
all of you to my home.

24:09.682 --> 24:12.516
Even my degenerate group
of gambling friends

24:12.518 --> 24:14.685
who have
set such a terrible
example for me.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.487
[laughter]

24:17.557 --> 24:21.525
But seriously,
I am a very lucky man.

24:22.462 --> 24:26.897
[Walter] But wealth is
of no value unless you have
friends with which to share it.

24:27.867 --> 24:33.537
I regard
each and every one of you
as my friend.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.206
[laughing]

24:35.208 --> 24:37.541
And because
you are my friend,
you are my family.

24:38.177 --> 24:41.545
[Walter] It would honor me
greatly if you would
accept my invitation

24:41.547 --> 24:45.249
to participate
in my extraordinary
good fortune.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.587
Hear, hear!
[applause]

24:49.589 --> 24:51.689
[Duke]
<i> Checkmate.</i>
<i> Slam dunk, over!</i>

24:51.691 --> 24:53.891
[Duke]
<i> The most successful</i>
<i> business man in the world</i>

24:53.893 --> 24:56.560
<i> just gave us an "in"</i>
<i> to all his investment riches.</i>

24:56.562 --> 24:59.897
[Duke] <i> Impossible</i>
<i> for the ordinary man.</i>
<i> But we were chosen.</i>

24:59.899 --> 25:01.899
Congratulations.

25:01.901 --> 25:04.268
[Duke]
<i> As bad as Sebastian was,</i>
<i> I owed him for this one.</i>

25:06.672 --> 25:09.974
[Duke]<i> When I got back to LA,</i>
<i> I rounded up</i>
<i> practically all of our money.</i>

25:09.976 --> 25:15.713
[Duke]<i> Total about 1.2 million</i>
<i> and wired it immediately in</i>
<i> to Walter's main hedge fund.</i>

25:16.883 --> 25:19.850
[Duke]<i> Deep down, I knew</i>
<i> money really couldn't</i>
<i> bring you happiness.</i>

25:19.852 --> 25:23.621
[Duke]<i> But right now,</i>
<i> we weren't very deep,</i>
<i> and we were really happy.</i>

25:25.791 --> 25:27.725
[Duke]<i> Time went by</i>
<i> and all was well,</i>

25:28.828 --> 25:31.795
<i> even though Chucky</i>
<i> went sideways</i>
<i> and never paid anyone.</i>

25:32.698 --> 25:34.932
[Duke]
<i> Then, the day got real bad.</i>

25:36.702 --> 25:38.269
<i> We are following</i>
<i> breaking news tonight.</i>

25:38.271 --> 25:40.938
<i> We've learned</i>
<i>that billionaire Walter Brooks,</i>

25:40.940 --> 25:43.841
<i> chairman of one</i>
<i> of the most successful</i>
<i> venture capital firms,</i>

25:43.843 --> 25:45.676
<i> has been indicted</i>
<i> by the US Government</i>

25:45.678 --> 25:48.212
<i> for what appears to be</i>
<i> running a Ponzi scheme.</i>

25:48.214 --> 25:50.915
<i> Now his whereabouts</i>
<i> are unknown at this time,</i>

25:50.917 --> 25:55.119
<i> leaving disgruntled</i>
<i> investors in ruins</i>
<i> and desperate for answers.</i>

25:55.121 --> 25:56.320
What?

25:58.658 --> 26:01.325
[KC] No!

26:02.962 --> 26:07.698
[Duke]<i> After days</i>
<i> of phone calls</i>
<i> to lawyers, cops, even FBI,</i>

26:07.700 --> 26:10.200
<i> we finally realized</i>
<i> that our money was gone.</i>

26:13.306 --> 26:15.973
[Duke]<i> The worst</i>
<i> part about it is</i>
<i> that Sebastian told people</i>

26:15.975 --> 26:19.677
<i> he never really trusted Brooks</i>
<i> and never invested a dime.</i>

26:21.113 --> 26:25.583
[Duke]<i> To make</i>
<i> matters worse,</i>
<i> he was having a game.</i>

26:25.585 --> 26:27.785
[Duke]
<i> My game with my players.</i>

26:27.787 --> 26:30.154
I got a knife and duct tape!
And I'm bringing it!

26:30.156 --> 26:32.723
Who do you think we are?
The Sopranos?
Get back in the car.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.228
[Duke] Where's Sebastian?

26:45.304 --> 26:47.805
What is
all the excitement? Huh?

26:47.807 --> 26:49.707
Ah! Dukemeister.

26:51.177 --> 26:52.910
What the hell's going on?

26:52.912 --> 26:54.945
You're relieved, big man.
Thank you.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.914
What's that?
What're you talking about?

26:56.916 --> 26:58.983
What are you doing?
You having a game?

26:58.985 --> 27:01.218
My game? And you
don't invite me?

27:02.088 --> 27:04.855
This is
a hundred grand buy in.
You told me you're broke.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.690
You're trying
to steal my game.

27:06.692 --> 27:08.092
Wah!

27:10.096 --> 27:14.632
Duke, remember.
I'm sixth degree in black belt
on martial arts scale.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.901
Do not make me
karate the fuck at you.

27:22.008 --> 27:26.210
Okay.
But for the record,
it's fifth degree black belt.

27:26.212 --> 27:27.945
It only goes up
to fifth degree!

27:27.947 --> 27:30.147
Not in Europe. It's
a different fucking scale!

27:30.149 --> 27:32.282
Different scale? Really?
It's the metric system!

27:32.284 --> 27:33.851
Explain.
What do you mean explain?

27:33.853 --> 27:35.853
Didn't you go to school?
Yes, I did!

27:35.855 --> 27:37.788
Right!
Well, the metric system!

27:37.789 --> 27:39.722
What are you talking about?
The European metric system!

27:39.725 --> 27:41.392
I know the metric system!

27:45.898 --> 27:47.097
Is it fifth?

27:47.099 --> 27:48.899
Fuck!
That's embarrassing.

27:53.439 --> 27:56.173
[Duke]<i> With my game stolen</i>
<i> and my bankroll destroyed,</i>

27:56.175 --> 27:59.443
<i> I quickly tried to collect</i>
<i> on my Chucky Burns marker.</i>

27:59.445 --> 28:02.813
[Duke]<i> This whack job</i>
<i> did owe me</i>
<i>a quarter of a million dollars.</i>

28:06.118 --> 28:07.251
Hey!

28:08.254 --> 28:10.020
Hey! Hey! You look good.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.722
You look good.
Thanks. You?

28:11.724 --> 28:13.724
Yeah. I'm fine.
You look good.

28:13.726 --> 28:16.927
You look good.
Very healthy.

28:19.165 --> 28:21.165
[Duke]
Look, I got a problem.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.301
I'm really busted.
I need money.

28:25.337 --> 28:28.706
You owe me some money.
Two hundred
and fifty thousand.

28:31.777 --> 28:32.743
[nervous laugh]

28:34.413 --> 28:36.714
Do I really owe you
a quarter of a million?

28:37.416 --> 28:41.185
I'm not doubting you.
I just have
no memory of it.

28:42.121 --> 28:45.155
Yes. Yes, you owe me
250 000 dollars.

28:45.157 --> 28:48.025
Remember the Thanksgiving
game? You got gobbled up.

28:48.027 --> 28:50.127
Right. Right.

28:58.137 --> 29:00.337
Can I offer you a line?
No.

29:01.207 --> 29:03.107
You want some of these?
No.

29:03.109 --> 29:04.775
Some of these?
No.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.210
Some of this?
No.

29:08.781 --> 29:10.047
Okay. So...

29:13.919 --> 29:16.754
I wanna pay you.
I wanna pay you the money.

29:16.756 --> 29:19.823
Thank God. Thank God.
I knew you'd come through.
Thank you!

29:20.292 --> 29:21.291
But I'm broke.

29:23.395 --> 29:24.428
You're broke.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.264
Yeah. No one's
fucking hiring me anymore.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.365
I don't get it.

29:30.369 --> 29:31.769
Well, it's
a shock to me.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.071
Look, I'll see you around.

29:35.508 --> 29:38.909
Hey Duke! Hey,
uh, hey Duke. Duke?

29:41.247 --> 29:42.279
I'm really sorry.

29:45.050 --> 29:45.983
Hey, don't worry.

29:45.985 --> 29:51.522
My old man used to tell me
everyone goes broke,
only bums don't come back.

29:52.324 --> 29:53.257
You're not a bum.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.959
No, I'm not a bum.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.197
Winner. I'm a winner!

30:01.233 --> 30:05.202
I'm a winner! Whoo!

30:08.541 --> 30:11.074
[Duke]
<i> Months went by</i>
<i> and things got worse.</i>

30:12.344 --> 30:14.111
[Duke]
<i> I was dead broke</i>
<i> with bills to pay</i>

30:14.113 --> 30:16.246
<i> and a family who acted</i>
<i> like I didn't exist.</i>

30:17.316 --> 30:19.817
Hey! Love you guys!

30:19.819 --> 30:21.885
Yeah, right dad, right!

30:23.022 --> 30:24.822
[phone ringing]

30:24.824 --> 30:26.323
[Duke]
<i> Then... a break.</i>

30:28.561 --> 30:29.493
Hello?

30:31.363 --> 30:34.998
[Duke]<i> A call</i>
<i> from Sebastian to meet.</i>
<i> He said he had good news.</i>

30:35.000 --> 30:37.167
[Duke] <i> I was at his house</i>
<i> in twenty minutes.</i>

30:37.169 --> 30:39.369
Beautiful, last, we'll
sink a little bit lower

30:39.371 --> 30:41.305
with each out breath,
each inhale,

30:41.307 --> 30:43.407
lengthen,
from middle sternum
to crown of the head,

30:43.409 --> 30:46.210
each exhale sink
a little bit lower,

30:46.212 --> 30:48.378
there we go. One more in,
press your in...
Hey.

30:48.380 --> 30:49.546
Now let's move...

30:50.382 --> 30:51.982
[Sebastian] Get me
a nice towel.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.286
Namaste, Duke.

30:57.156 --> 31:00.991
So, why am I here?
To watch you
audition for Peter Pan?

31:00.993 --> 31:03.327
What, does this make
you uncomfortable? Hmm?

31:05.865 --> 31:08.198
Listen,
the reason you're here.

31:09.268 --> 31:12.135
I know you've had
a tough time
with Walter Brooks.

31:13.138 --> 31:16.139
I know
that prick Chucky
still owes you some dough.

31:16.141 --> 31:19.543
So I'd like
to buy Chucky's marker
off of you.

31:20.546 --> 31:21.478
Really?

31:22.948 --> 31:24.414
It's worth 250 grand.

31:24.416 --> 31:29.219
Yeah, but rumor has it,
he is one foot in the grave
and he's MC Hammer broke.

31:29.221 --> 31:33.190
You know?
So, I'm thinking,
I'll buy his marker.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.560
Maybe it pays off
in ten years.
Maybe it don't.

31:36.562 --> 31:39.897
But for forty grand,
it might be with worth it.

31:39.899 --> 31:42.432
Forty grand! No,
that's ridiculous.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.636
Okay. I knew you'd bargain.

31:46.939 --> 31:50.107
I'm willing to go up.
Sixty. But not more.

31:52.211 --> 31:53.310
I'll take it.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.480
Of course you will.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.952
[Duke]
<i> With the sixty grand,</i>
<i> I laid low for a while.</i>

32:03.656 --> 32:05.455
[Duke]<i> And waited</i>
<i> for the right game.</i>

32:08.627 --> 32:10.694
[Duke]<i> A thing happens</i>
<i> when you're used to playing</i>

32:10.696 --> 32:13.397
<i> for a hundred grand</i>
<i> and now you're</i>
<i> playing for ten.</i>

32:15.334 --> 32:19.603
[Duke]<i> You play bad.</i>
<i> I lost the entire sixty</i>
<i> in one night.</i>

32:27.579 --> 32:31.982
So... we're down
to the two dollar
tequila now, huh?

32:33.218 --> 32:34.251
Pathetic.

32:38.490 --> 32:39.990
Here's some bad news.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.363
What? What is this?

32:48.233 --> 32:51.301
Yeah. Great timing
to sell to Sebastian.

32:51.303 --> 32:56.306
Chucky's rich again.
I heard he paid Sebastian
back the 250 K weeks ago.

32:57.710 --> 33:01.411
It gets worse.
Read the part about who's
executive producing the show.

33:01.413 --> 33:04.982
Sebastian.
Oh, my God! No, no!

33:04.984 --> 33:07.451
Which means Sebastian knew
he was doing the show

33:07.453 --> 33:10.120
and he couldn't wait
to hustle you.
Fucking...!

33:12.124 --> 33:14.558
You better just straighten up,
you drunken fool. Alright?

33:14.560 --> 33:16.994
You just got robbed again
by that scumbag!

33:19.698 --> 33:21.331
Time to get
your balls back.

33:23.268 --> 33:24.501
Let's snap this guy.

33:30.542 --> 33:33.210
[Duke]
<i> About a week later,</i>
<i> I met up with Angry Jim.</i>

33:33.212 --> 33:36.313
[Duke]<i> I was gonna try</i>
<i> and sell him my golf clubs</i>
<i> for two hundred bucks</i>

33:36.315 --> 33:38.482
<i> even though</i>
<i> they were probably</i>
<i> still worth a grand.</i>

33:38.484 --> 33:40.250
[Duke]<i> I was</i>
<i> desperate for money.</i>

33:41.687 --> 33:44.388
You made me
come out to the valley
again for these?

33:45.290 --> 33:47.424
These clubs look like
they've been through a war.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.460
[Duke] Yeah.
[phone ringing]

33:51.096 --> 33:52.029
Hello.

33:57.169 --> 33:58.368
What?

34:00.472 --> 34:04.775
[Duke]<i> Sandor was dead.</i>
<i> He had a heart attack</i>
<i> at the racetrack.</i>

34:12.785 --> 34:14.818
Sandor was
a very special guy.

34:16.522 --> 34:17.454
True gambler.

34:20.159 --> 34:23.827
A man with great passion
and many, many friends.

34:26.498 --> 34:29.433
Don't seem like to me.
There's what? Eight people?

34:29.435 --> 34:33.703
If you were broke,
Sandor would give you money.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.106
He wasn't about himself.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.276
Unlike
other people in this room.

34:41.113 --> 34:42.379
I think he's talking
about you.

34:42.381 --> 34:45.115
He was about giving.
Oh, he gave.

34:46.218 --> 34:48.185
He still owes me
like twenty five grand.

34:49.188 --> 34:51.221
Welcher, welcher...
Hey, come on.

34:51.223 --> 34:53.690
Sandor,
you were a great man.

34:55.194 --> 34:56.660
May the river card
always hit you.

35:00.299 --> 35:01.398
I'm sorry. So sorry.

35:06.505 --> 35:09.106
You know, I think
I'd like to say
a little something.

35:10.309 --> 35:13.510
Hey! You can't say a damn word!
What? I'm paying my respect.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.712
Respects? Respect him?
Yeah.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.681
You didn't respect him
when you broke him

35:17.683 --> 35:20.150
for 250 000 when he was
stone cold drunk, did you?

35:20.152 --> 35:22.352
Why are you
bringing that up now?

35:22.354 --> 35:24.287
Sit down.
You sit down.

35:24.289 --> 35:27.157
I will sit down. You sit down.
I stood up first. You sit down.

35:27.159 --> 35:28.525
Sorry.
He's very emotional.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.293
He's emotional.
My apologies.

35:30.295 --> 35:31.828
He's emotional right now.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.530
Sit down.
You sit down.

35:35.134 --> 35:36.299
No, you sit down.
Sit down.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.235
I'm gonna sit down.
Sit down.

35:38.237 --> 35:40.904
He's insensitive.
Insensitive! Yes!

35:51.416 --> 35:55.719
[knocking on wood]
It's a nice fucking box.
What is that, oak?

35:56.522 --> 35:58.655
I'm very sorry
for your loss.
Thank you.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.858
[woman struggling]

36:06.798 --> 36:10.167
[sighing]
Hi, Papiana.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.602
Oh!
I'm so sorry!

36:13.172 --> 36:15.205
Oh, sweetie,
that was so beautiful.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.940
Thank you. Thank you.

36:16.942 --> 36:20.177
And thank you
for what you said
about my brother.

36:20.179 --> 36:22.679
Thank you.
Anyway, uh...

36:22.681 --> 36:28.451
Every year my mother would
send Sandor a sum of money
to enjoy his life with.

36:28.453 --> 36:30.420
Right.
Anyway...

36:30.422 --> 36:33.323
In honor of Sandor
and your friendship,

36:33.792 --> 36:36.860
my mother and I
would like you to have this.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.628
Oh.

36:39.765 --> 36:40.931
[Wing] What is it?

36:40.933 --> 36:46.670
[Wing] You're kidding! No way!
Holy fuck! Oh my God! Oh my God!

36:46.672 --> 36:48.939
[Wing]
Duke just inherited
a million dollars!

36:50.876 --> 36:52.876
We're saved.
We won't lose the house!

36:52.878 --> 36:55.779
[Angry]
Wow! Duke's rolling in
the big money now, huh.

36:56.481 --> 36:59.683
[Wing] Woohoo!
My grandpa used to say

36:59.685 --> 37:02.419
sometimes good can
come from sorrow.

37:04.523 --> 37:08.291
Hey, listen.
Perhaps with this,
maybe the old man here

37:09.328 --> 37:11.795
could buy his way
back in my game
with this sort of money.

37:11.797 --> 37:14.431
Relax, conman.
I'll never play
in your game again.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.800
Why are you calling me names?
Why is he being so hostile?

37:16.802 --> 37:18.635
I was just coming over
to congratulate you.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.804
No, you weren't.
You came over here
because of this.

37:20.806 --> 37:23.506
We have a little money
again that we can
get out of debt with.

37:23.508 --> 37:25.442
You want to hustle it.
I know you.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.444
But I don't want your money.
Good! Good.

37:27.446 --> 37:29.746
Now please leave
before I bust your face!
How about that?

37:29.748 --> 37:31.615
[Wing] Hey, come on guys.
He's mean to me.

37:32.317 --> 37:35.352
Now I am mad, I do want
your fucking money.
Hey, hey!

37:35.354 --> 37:36.686
You want my money.

37:36.688 --> 37:39.389
He is bragging
about how he wins any prop.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.491
Smartest man
in the room. Right, Duke?

37:41.493 --> 37:42.859
Don't know
what you're talking about.

37:42.861 --> 37:45.662
Why don't
you put your money
where your mouth is?

37:45.664 --> 37:47.631
You pick a prop.
Anything. Sound fair?

37:48.400 --> 37:51.568
Head's up at poker?
Game of golf.
Whatever you want.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.004
Be a big man.
Put your money down.

37:55.474 --> 37:56.973
You're not really thinking...

37:59.845 --> 38:01.445
Babe, stay out of this.
You know what I think?

38:01.446 --> 38:03.046
I think the problem
is that you've played
the knowing gambler too long.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.548
You're a has been
who just wants to play

38:05.550 --> 38:07.484
in his shitty
little valley game.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.854
I'll do it!
Get your million ready.

38:10.856 --> 38:13.023
[Wing] Oh, no. Oh God.
Are you crazy?

38:13.025 --> 38:15.492
We got our life back,
now you want
to risk everything?

38:15.494 --> 38:18.028
Babe, Sandor
would've wanted this.
I've got the edge.

38:18.030 --> 38:19.929
We'll win.
Who's crushing it?

38:21.033 --> 38:23.700
Not you!
You're on your own!

38:25.370 --> 38:28.004
This is without me.
[Angry] That was awkward.

38:29.041 --> 38:31.675
So, what's the bet gonna be?

38:35.047 --> 38:37.047
A million dollar
walk to Vegas!

38:38.083 --> 38:42.352
Very sexy!
Okay assholes, the bet is on!

38:42.821 --> 38:45.989
Either one of you
guys pulls out now,
you owe a hundred grand.

38:45.991 --> 38:49.759
[Angry] After tonight,
it's two hundred!
The overall bet is a million.

38:51.396 --> 38:55.365
Extra betting is encouraged.
Let's do this!

38:56.501 --> 38:59.836
[Duke]<i> We bickered</i>
<i> for hours going over</i>
<i> every little detail.</i>

38:59.838 --> 39:02.505
Okay,
so three times a day
for fifteen minutes,

39:02.507 --> 39:07.644
Duke can come into the RV,
use the restroom,
the shower if he so pleases.

39:07.646 --> 39:10.880
No! Twice a day!
Tops. That's it. I'm not
running a fucking hotel.

39:11.717 --> 39:14.351
[Duke]
<i> Most of the big issues</i>
<i> were settled on.</i>

39:14.353 --> 39:18.855
[Duke]<i> I had to sleep outside,</i>
<i> I could walk or run,</i>
<i> 90 % in the daytime,</i>

39:18.857 --> 39:23.126
<i> no hats allowed,</i>
<i> and I could only eat or drink</i>
<i> what I packed in my bag.</i>

39:24.129 --> 39:28.765
Now let's talk
about the biggest
issue of all: days.

39:29.468 --> 39:32.602
Wait, wait. What's he
talking about? We decided
it was going to be nine days.

39:32.604 --> 39:35.605
No, we said
eight or nine days
to be negotiated.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.073
But I'm
leaning towards eight.

39:37.075 --> 39:40.143
Guys, get serious.
I'm 48 years old.

39:40.145 --> 39:44.514
Okay, the walk to Vegas
in eight days is
36 miles a day. Impossible.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.649
Yeah. There's no way
he's going to make that.

39:46.651 --> 39:48.718
Look at him.
He's an old drunk.

39:49.921 --> 39:50.887
Sorry, Duke.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.957
No worries.
[Angry] He does drink a lot.

39:53.959 --> 39:55.525
That is true.

39:55.527 --> 39:56.826
[Hank]
Fuck, shit, fuck, shit.

39:56.828 --> 40:00.764
Boys, he's
been playing professional
tennis his whole life.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.767
He works out twice a day.
He's conning us.

40:04.503 --> 40:07.537
No, it's eight days.
Take it or leave it.

40:12.811 --> 40:16.780
Okay, you got me! Eight days.

40:17.616 --> 40:20.417
And as long as you're
stealing my money,
how about this one?

40:20.419 --> 40:22.919
How about seven days?
[man] What?

40:22.921 --> 40:24.821
What are you talking about?
You're kidding?

40:24.823 --> 40:29.692
I'll do it in seven days
in the tradition
of the Doyle Brunson bet.

40:31.963 --> 40:34.597
But Doyle was 32
when he made that bet.

40:34.599 --> 40:39.169
He was in superior shape.
He could run a marathon
in three hours in his sleep.

40:40.539 --> 40:42.806
[man] Damn right.
I suppose you'd want odds on it.

40:42.808 --> 40:45.875
Yes, of course,
I want odds. Big odds,
or I'm out of here.

40:45.877 --> 40:47.844
[man] That's right!
That's crazy!

40:47.846 --> 40:51.014
No, it's not. Seven
days to walk to Vegas
at 48 years old,

40:51.016 --> 40:53.683
a semi drunk
in hot desert heat?

40:53.685 --> 40:58.755
Give us a break. He could
never do it, so it's gotta be
twenty to one, at least.

40:58.757 --> 41:00.190
[man] Yeah.
[man 2] Thirty!

41:00.192 --> 41:02.158
[man] Thirty to one!
That's what I'm thinking.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.827
What do you think
we should give him?

41:05.130 --> 41:06.763
You think
he can actually make it?

41:07.999 --> 41:11.734
It can't be done.
Not by him.
It's a fucking lock.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.105
Alright, alright.
Here we are. Here we are.

41:17.075 --> 41:20.810
In the tradition
of the Doyle bet,
we do it in seven days.

41:20.812 --> 41:24.481
But big man here's
gotta wear a suit.
What? What?

41:24.483 --> 41:27.550
A suit? You want me to wear
a suit in the desert?
Are you crazy?

41:27.552 --> 41:30.119
[Sebastian] That was
part of the original bet
and you know it.

41:30.121 --> 41:34.123
Seven days, you in a suit.
I'll give you
five to one.

41:35.193 --> 41:38.695
This is crazy.
You know Doyle
never made the bet?

41:39.764 --> 41:43.933
He stopped. He pulled
off because he knew it was
impossible to win. Yeah.

41:43.935 --> 41:46.870
Yeah, because you knew
about the suit,
which I'm impressed by,

41:46.872 --> 41:50.139
you must also know
about the Jack Binion clause.

41:50.141 --> 41:52.775
That his best friend
Jack Binion could
actually relieve him

41:52.777 --> 41:54.611
the last 25
miles if need be.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.546
That's it?

41:56.548 --> 42:01.651
That's all you're whining about
as our sticking point?
Fuck. Alright. Deal.

42:03.154 --> 42:04.087
[Duke] Deal.

42:04.956 --> 42:06.256
You'd better warm up some.

42:08.527 --> 42:11.794
[Duke]
<i> With only ten days to prepare,</i>
<i> I had to move fast.</i>

42:11.796 --> 42:15.098
[pop song]

42:19.170 --> 42:21.738
¶<i> You calm down, calm down</i> ¶

42:21.740 --> 42:24.874
[Duke]<i> To make it official,</i>
<i> all the money was put</i>
<i> into an escrow account.</i>

42:26.044 --> 42:28.828
[Duke]<i> Very reputable.</i>

42:28.829 --> 42:31.613
¶<i> And I'm bound, I'm bound</i>
<i> In all our place</i> ¶

42:31.616 --> 42:33.983
¶<i> There is no sound</i>
<i> No sound</i> ¶

42:33.985 --> 42:37.287
[Duke]<i> I hadn't worked out</i>
<i> this hard in years.</i>
<i> But I was feeling great.</i>

42:37.289 --> 42:39.088
Hi, neighbor!
Fuck you!

42:41.893 --> 42:47.897
¶<i> Ey, ey</i> ¶

42:50.235 --> 42:54.103
I'm the king
of the Valley!

42:58.343 --> 43:01.110
I'm ready to go.
Where are these guys?

43:02.681 --> 43:04.614
They said noon.
Yeah.

43:06.051 --> 43:10.086
[musical car horn]

43:11.990 --> 43:14.257
[man on speaker]
<i> Welcome, K-Mart shoppers!</i>

43:18.263 --> 43:21.664
Oh! Oh! Lookin' sharp!

43:23.301 --> 43:25.201
So this is what
a Valley looks like, huh?

43:25.203 --> 43:27.837
Sweet RV, Sebastian!

43:27.839 --> 43:29.005
Suck a dick, Carl.

43:29.007 --> 43:30.640
[Carl] Yeah...

43:30.642 --> 43:32.275
Where's the missus?
Where's the boy at?

43:32.277 --> 43:34.344
I thought you guys
would be celebrating.

43:34.346 --> 43:36.379
Have some confetti,
some balloons.

43:36.381 --> 43:38.781
I got my family covered.
Don't worry about it.

43:40.218 --> 43:44.387
Okay guys,
Pops is leaving!
I love you!

43:45.290 --> 43:48.024
Fuck you!
[door closing]

43:48.660 --> 43:50.760
In case you don't know,
they still aren't talking.

43:50.762 --> 43:51.894
I fucking got it, Carl!

43:53.798 --> 43:56.633
Alright,
love, ready, huh?
I wanna get out of here.

43:56.635 --> 43:58.134
This Valley smog
is burning my eyes.

44:00.338 --> 44:01.270
Yeah.

44:03.141 --> 44:05.875
[Hank laughing]
Bye-bye.

44:05.877 --> 44:11.714
Okay, million dollar
walk to Vegas, begins now!

44:12.751 --> 44:14.951
[Duke]<i> 280 miles</i>
<i> to the Vegas sign.</i>

44:14.953 --> 44:16.719
<i> I had to win this bet.</i>

44:16.721 --> 44:21.791
<i> I chose to wear the suit</i>
<i> that I proposed to KC in,</i>
<i> 13 years ago.</i>

44:21.793 --> 44:23.292
<i> It was my lucky suit.</i>

44:23.294 --> 44:30.066
<i> I took the old back</i>
<i>route from the north end of the</i>
<i> Valley through Santa Clarita.</i>

44:34.105 --> 44:36.339
<i> All the guys</i>
<i> had action on the bet,</i>

44:37.909 --> 44:40.243
<i> most taking pieces</i>
<i> on Sebastian's side.</i>

44:40.245 --> 44:42.779
[Duke]<i> Just Wing and Carl</i>
<i> making bets on me.</i>

44:42.781 --> 44:46.783
[musical car horn]

44:48.219 --> 44:51.854
[man in speaker]
<i> Hey, Dukey, we're all</i>
<i> having ice cream sandwiches.</i>

44:51.856 --> 44:54.724
[man]<i> I don't wanna brag,</i>
<i> but we are having</i>
<i> ice cream sandwiches.</i>

44:57.062 --> 44:59.128
[Duke]<i> I got</i>
<i> through 40 miles</i>
<i> on day one.</i>

44:59.831 --> 45:01.230
[Duke]
<i> I was right on schedule.</i>

45:01.232 --> 45:03.700
[animals howling and barking]

45:03.702 --> 45:06.936
Thank you!
Thank you, coyotes!

45:06.938 --> 45:09.272
I'll be here all week!

45:10.442 --> 45:14.110
I can't believe the bastard
made Vasquez Rocks
on the first day!

45:15.080 --> 45:19.816
Vasquez Rocks? Isn't that
where Rock Hudson shot
that movie "Rio Bravo"

45:19.818 --> 45:21.751
where he killed
all those Indians?

45:21.753 --> 45:24.087
I don't care.
No, incorrect.

45:24.089 --> 45:25.855
That would be John Wayne.

45:26.291 --> 45:29.292
Did I ever tell you
I handled his son Patrick
back in the day?

45:29.294 --> 45:32.328
You didn't. But you know what?
I'm having trouble
sleeping at night,

45:32.330 --> 45:35.498
so why don't
you call me later
and retell that story?

45:41.239 --> 45:44.974
[Duke]<i> Day two</i>
<i> I hit it early</i>
<i> and sprung down the road.</i>

45:45.777 --> 45:49.212
[Duke]<i> I cruised down</i>
<i> Pearblossom Highway.</i>
<i> And was making time.</i>

45:50.815 --> 45:53.316
[Duke]<i> I breezed</i>
<i> through the mountains</i>
<i> like it was nothing.</i>

45:58.156 --> 46:00.790
[Duke]<i> It was hot,</i>
<i> but I was kicking ass!</i>

46:00.792 --> 46:04.393
[Duke] <i> With the beautiful sun</i>
<i> shining down, I was strong</i>
<i> and full of vitamin D.</i>

46:04.395 --> 46:06.062
[Duke]<i> My body</i>
<i> was in its zone.</i>

46:06.064 --> 46:10.066
[Duke]<i> I was excited</i>
<i> about life and at total peace</i>
<i> with the world.</i>

46:11.002 --> 46:13.169
Yo, Pops!
You're fucking sick!

46:13.171 --> 46:15.004
[laughing]

46:17.909 --> 46:19.942
Come on, punks!

46:25.450 --> 46:29.285
[Duke] <i> Fucking millennials.</i>
<i>They think they're all hot shit</i>
<i> with their craft beer.</i>

46:32.557 --> 46:37.894
<i> After that debacle,</i>
<i>I started to hurt and slow down.</i>

46:40.165 --> 46:43.166
<i> Around noon time,</i>
<i> I felt tingling</i>
<i> around my neck.</i>

46:43.168 --> 46:44.901
<i> The start of heat stroke.</i>

46:48.907 --> 46:52.275
Alright, 15 minute
RV break starts now!

46:52.277 --> 46:53.843
Give him room!

46:54.279 --> 46:56.846
[Carl] Okay! Okay,
here he comes.

46:56.848 --> 47:00.049
[Carl] Here comes the champ.
You know something?
You're getting a good tan.

47:00.852 --> 47:01.851
[Carl] Uh oh.

47:03.922 --> 47:06.389
Someone give him
a cell phone.
So he can call the misses.

47:09.494 --> 47:10.493
Too soon?

47:11.329 --> 47:12.428
I take it back.

47:12.430 --> 47:17.567
Oh, my gosh! Yeah, it takes
a real tough guy
to hit a child.

47:18.570 --> 47:20.903
[Carl]
Hey! You're looking good.

47:20.905 --> 47:25.274
[Carl] And you're feeling good!
[Duke vomiting]

47:27.045 --> 47:28.277
He's fine.

47:30.048 --> 47:32.882
[Duke]<i> That afternoon,</i>
<i> I was dragging.</i>

47:34.285 --> 47:37.854
<i> But with five million dollars</i>
<i> to win, I pushed on.</i>

47:42.994 --> 47:45.261
<i> There were times</i>
<i> I'd get ahead of the RV.</i>

47:45.263 --> 47:49.232
<i> They'd stall,</i>
<i> have lunch or go to some</i>
<i> sleazy strip joint.</i>

47:51.202 --> 47:54.270
<i> I cut across</i>
<i> a lot of open desert</i>
<i> to make better time.</i>

47:55.573 --> 47:57.907
<i> Of course,</i>
<i> Sebastian wouldn't trust me,</i>

47:59.978 --> 48:03.479
<i> so he hired this scout</i>
<i> to walk behind me</i>
<i> about a half mile away</i>

48:03.481 --> 48:08.017
<i> just in case a motorcycle</i>
<i> didn't pick me up and drive me</i>
<i> ten miles down the road.</i>

48:08.553 --> 48:09.919
[Angry]
<i> Oh, we're fucked.</i>

48:09.921 --> 48:13.623
Duke's already gone
a hundred miles in two days.

48:13.625 --> 48:15.925
That guy's a fucking machine.
Nah.

48:15.927 --> 48:18.628
We'll be alright.
He'll tire out
after day three.

48:18.630 --> 48:21.163
Nobody beats
a fucking desert.
Trust me.

48:21.165 --> 48:23.099
[door knocking]
Check or bet.

48:23.101 --> 48:26.235
Hey, guys,
it's too hot in here.
I need some water.

48:26.237 --> 48:28.471
Wonton,
get the fuck back in there.

48:28.473 --> 48:30.640
You pop out again,
you lose the bet!

48:31.342 --> 48:34.477
[Hank]
Water? He wants water?
I don't think so.

48:34.479 --> 48:36.512
[laughter]

48:42.253 --> 48:44.620
[Duke]
<i> By the end of day two</i>
<i> I was exhausted.</i>

48:44.622 --> 48:48.157
<i> And with everything at stake,</i>
<i> I went into autopilot,</i>

48:48.159 --> 48:50.393
<i> and made Victorville</i>
<i> before nightfall.</i>

48:59.137 --> 49:02.071
<i> Day three.</i>
<i> Way ahead of schedule.</i>

49:03.408 --> 49:05.508
<i> My body</i>
<i> feeling surprisingly good.</i>

49:05.510 --> 49:06.943
<i> I was off.</i>

49:11.482 --> 49:14.984
[police siren sound]
[man in speaker] Pull over.

49:15.420 --> 49:16.719
[police siren sound]

49:21.259 --> 49:23.025
[Sebastian]
What is this about?

49:23.027 --> 49:25.294
I stopped
you because you're
slowing down traffic.

49:25.296 --> 49:28.664
Ugh...I don't have
time for this. I mean,
clearly, you're insane.

49:28.666 --> 49:32.601
How are we slowing down
traffic when there is
no fucking traffic?

49:33.738 --> 49:35.738
Jesus Christ! Look,

49:35.740 --> 49:39.575
I know for a fact
that we paid
all you hillbilly cops off.

49:39.577 --> 49:41.477
Rather handsomely,
I may add.

49:41.479 --> 49:43.479
Who you calling a hillbilly?
You.

49:43.481 --> 49:46.282
Hey! What's the problem?
What's the problem?

49:46.284 --> 49:48.384
This silly hick fuck
wants to shut us down.

49:48.386 --> 49:51.320
Hey, sir,
return to your vehicle! Now!

49:51.322 --> 49:54.223
My what?
Return to your vehicle now.

49:55.560 --> 49:57.193
Do it!
[Sebastian] What did he say?

49:57.195 --> 49:59.061
[Duke] Let go!
[Sebastian] My vehicle?

49:59.063 --> 50:01.030
[Sebastian]
They don't even
speak English.

50:02.567 --> 50:04.567
There they go with their guns.
Get in there!

50:04.569 --> 50:06.402
For fuck sake.
Officer.

50:06.404 --> 50:08.637
Vehicles. It's not even a word!
Officer. Can I explain?

50:08.639 --> 50:11.407
My name's Duke.
I apologize for that guy.
He's a movie director.

50:11.409 --> 50:12.641
Oh, I know who he is.

50:13.411 --> 50:15.411
And you Hollywood pricks
think you can get away

50:15.413 --> 50:17.513
with whatever
you want, don't you?

50:17.515 --> 50:20.016
Yeah, actually,
I agree with you
about Hollywood pricks.

50:20.018 --> 50:23.019
They all are.
I used to be an actor
in Hollywood myself. Yeah.

50:24.589 --> 50:26.689
But anyway,
that guy in there,
trust me,

50:26.691 --> 50:29.125
he's the biggest
Hollywood prick
you'll ever meet.

50:29.127 --> 50:33.129
You know what?
I'm broke because
of that prick. Yeah.

50:33.131 --> 50:36.465
I can't support my wife
and my kid. Honest to God
because of that prick.

50:37.668 --> 50:41.437
And, sadly I made a bet
with that stupid prick

50:41.439 --> 50:45.574
that I can, it's crazy,
walk to Vegas in seven days.

50:45.576 --> 50:47.376
A walk to Vegas?

50:48.646 --> 50:51.047
Are you out of your mind?
Yeah.

50:51.049 --> 50:53.549
Maybe I am. I don't know.
But I'm doing it.
I'm out here right now!

50:53.551 --> 50:56.318
I'm half way through
and, officer,
if you stop me now,

50:56.320 --> 50:59.422
I will lose,
that prick
will have ruined me.

51:03.694 --> 51:04.643
I don't know what I'll do.

51:04.644 --> 51:05.593
I'm sorry
I called you a silly fuck.

51:07.598 --> 51:09.365
Wow, he really is
a prick, isn't he?

51:14.072 --> 51:17.106
Well, listen.
You got a bet to win.

51:19.544 --> 51:20.843
And I'm not gonna stop you.

51:21.712 --> 51:23.779
You're not? Really?

51:24.749 --> 51:27.349
That's great! Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

51:28.386 --> 51:33.756
You know what the difference
between a porcupine and a bus
full of Hollywood types is?

51:35.326 --> 51:39.528
No, not really.
Don't know.
I don't know.

51:39.530 --> 51:42.164
The porcupine
has his pricks
on the outside.

51:45.169 --> 51:47.336
That... That's funny.

51:47.338 --> 51:51.340
That's the porcupine
reference... That's good.

51:51.342 --> 51:53.242
Yeah, yeah.
I just made that one up.

51:53.244 --> 51:55.377
Yeah, we got
a little comedy
club in Lancaster.

51:55.379 --> 51:57.546
Sometimes, I go
in there and I...
It's a hobby.

51:57.548 --> 52:00.683
I try out some stuff.
That's clever stuff.

52:01.319 --> 52:02.718
Great sense of humor.

52:02.720 --> 52:06.355
If I was you, I would
get off this road.

52:06.357 --> 52:08.757
You wanna head out up
over that mountain there.

52:08.759 --> 52:10.759
It's a little terrain,
but you're gonna be fine.

52:10.761 --> 52:12.495
The road bends back around.

52:12.497 --> 52:14.864
It's gonna be
a real shortcut,
save you a few hours.

52:14.866 --> 52:16.765
No, you're kidding.
That's beautiful.

52:16.767 --> 52:18.868
Officer,
I can't thank you enough.
You are...

52:18.870 --> 52:22.505
I'm so sorry about him,
and you're fantastic!
And you're funny.

52:23.207 --> 52:24.373
It's been a real pleasure.

52:24.375 --> 52:26.242
Oh.
Yeah. Real actor.

52:26.244 --> 52:27.543
Meeting a real actor.

52:27.545 --> 52:29.645
You ever been
in anything I'd ever seen?

52:29.647 --> 52:32.148
Never.
Probably never. Way back.
Thank you though.

52:32.150 --> 52:33.782
No, I've seen
your face before.
I know you.

52:33.784 --> 52:35.451
Could I give you my card?

52:35.887 --> 52:39.421
I can't really do that now.
So, listen, you get going.

52:39.423 --> 52:43.392
Okay? You teach
that Hollywood prick a lesson.
Okay? You hear me?

52:43.828 --> 52:45.327
Alright.
I will.

52:45.329 --> 52:46.662
Hydrate.

52:49.934 --> 52:50.866
Oy!

52:51.903 --> 52:53.836
What's going on?
Is it happening or what?

52:53.838 --> 52:56.872
Yeah, it's happening!
The race is still on!

52:56.874 --> 52:59.408
And he agrees.
You're a Hollywood prick!

52:59.410 --> 53:00.609
<i> Adios.</i>

53:12.256 --> 53:13.355
Now they tell me!

53:35.680 --> 53:36.612
[Duke] What is this?

53:38.249 --> 53:40.382
[Duke] Hillbilly help!
[voice echoing]

53:42.687 --> 53:43.619
Okay.

53:43.621 --> 53:48.490
Is that irritating?
Some shortcut your pal took.

53:49.927 --> 53:52.628
[Duke]<i> Hours later,</i>
<i> I hit rock bottom.</i>

53:53.698 --> 53:54.630
[Duke]<i> Literally.</i>

54:00.571 --> 54:02.705
[Duke]<i> It was a miracle</i>
<i> I even found the RV.</i>

54:07.945 --> 54:10.613
Alright, your call.
Hey! What the fuck is that?

54:15.019 --> 54:17.453
Come on.
You're putting
the heater on? Seriously?

54:17.455 --> 54:19.622
I'm not fucking
Ben & Jerry's, Carl!

54:19.624 --> 54:20.990
[Sebastian]
Freezing in here!

54:27.331 --> 54:30.399
You hustling creep!
You got to that cop!

54:30.401 --> 54:33.035
I'm sorry,
I can neither confirm nor deny.

54:33.037 --> 54:35.304
You son of a bitch!
You're gonna play that way?

54:35.906 --> 54:38.040
Look, I've got millions
riding on this, pitchman.

54:38.042 --> 54:41.644
Remember all skinning
is allowed in a snake pit.

54:43.014 --> 54:45.381
That's "I'll put
a rattlesnake
in your pocket

54:45.383 --> 54:47.049
and I'll ask for a match,"
you moron!

54:48.352 --> 54:50.352
You're misquoting
Amarillo Slim again!

54:57.428 --> 55:00.863
[Duke]<i> That little stunt</i>
<i> by Sebastian</i>
<i> cost me nearly six hours.</i>

55:04.335 --> 55:07.903
[Duke]<i> So I decided to cash in</i>
<i> on some of my limited</i>
<i> night walking time.</i>

55:10.975 --> 55:13.809
[wind blowing]
[Angry] Okay. Oh, look at that.

55:13.811 --> 55:15.911
[Hank] You feel that?
[Angry] Whoo!

55:15.913 --> 55:19.381
I'm glad I'm in here
and it's cozy.
Are we gonna play?

55:19.383 --> 55:20.916
[Hank] Some kind
of crazy sandstorm?

55:22.720 --> 55:25.788
[banging the door]
Hey! Let me in!

55:26.424 --> 55:30.359
Yes, can I help you?
I'm blowing away! Let me in!

55:31.662 --> 55:34.797
Duke, I'm sorry, big man,
you've already had your break.

55:34.799 --> 55:36.598
We've discussed this.

55:36.600 --> 55:39.034
You cannot a take break
within three hours
of each other.

55:39.036 --> 55:43.639
I mean, the rules are rules
unless you wanna concede.

55:43.641 --> 55:45.374
Concede, my ass!

55:45.376 --> 55:48.911
Take your hand
off my door handle.
Dukey?

55:48.913 --> 55:50.679
[Duke]
<i> Sebastian wasn't budging.</i>

55:50.681 --> 55:52.881
[Duke]<i> I had to get</i>
<i> the hazmat suit</i>

55:52.883 --> 55:55.484
<i> that Wing had</i>
<i> brought along</i>
<i> for emergencies like this.</i>

55:55.486 --> 55:57.019
Come on,
Sebastian. This is cruel.

55:57.021 --> 55:59.355
Let him in!
What do you guys worried?

55:59.357 --> 56:02.558
[Sebastian] If he dies, he dies.
Let my brother in, come on!

56:02.560 --> 56:05.694
[Wing] Yeah!
[laughing]

56:05.696 --> 56:08.597
[Duke] I need the hazmat suit.
The hazmat suit!

56:08.599 --> 56:10.499
Huh? What's
he trying to say?

56:10.501 --> 56:12.067
The hazmat suit!
I need it!

56:12.069 --> 56:14.570
Little Dukey.
What's he trying to say?

56:14.572 --> 56:16.839
He's trying to communicate.
He's trying to play charades?

56:16.841 --> 56:18.607
Oh, I love charades.
[Hank] So do I!

56:18.609 --> 56:22.644
A thousand bucks a man
to whoever figures it!
Whip out!

56:22.646 --> 56:24.980
[Hank] No one beats me.
I can play
at Betty White's house!

56:25.549 --> 56:29.885
[talking at the same time]
Give me something to write!

56:29.887 --> 56:33.655
[Wing]
Dirty mag, soft porn.
He's cold. Rock the cradle.

56:33.657 --> 56:36.458
A hazmat suit. Ebola!

56:36.460 --> 56:39.428
Wings, wings,
it must be airplane!

56:39.430 --> 56:41.430
He's saying airplane.
Write down "airplane."

56:41.432 --> 56:44.133
[Wing] Airplane.
[Carl] Airplane.

56:45.102 --> 56:48.904
Oh! Not airplane! E!

56:48.906 --> 56:51.607
That's the letter E.
Write down E!

56:51.609 --> 56:53.609
[Wing] Hold on. Hold on.
[Carl] E. E?

56:55.112 --> 56:57.913
Yes! Yes.
Got it!

56:57.915 --> 57:02.618
Second syllable. Looks
like he's pitching softball.

57:02.620 --> 57:05.587
[Hank] Betty White cookies.
[Carl] Softball? Yeah, softball.

57:05.589 --> 57:07.456
[Carl]
I know what he's doing.
He's bowling.

57:07.458 --> 57:09.992
Bowling?
[Carl] Yes. Write down bowling.

57:09.994 --> 57:12.060
[Angry]
Don't know anybody
who bowls like that.

57:14.064 --> 57:16.932
Yes! Bowling! Ebola!
I need...

57:16.934 --> 57:19.735
[Wing]
He wants the hazmat suit!
He wants the hazmat suit!

57:19.737 --> 57:22.171
[Wing]
Got it! Got it!
I win four thousand dollars.

57:22.173 --> 57:24.840
[Carl]
You'd better hurry.
He's gonna blow away.

57:24.842 --> 57:27.476
[Carl] It's not in the fridge.
[Wing] I love this game.

57:28.145 --> 57:34.149
[jazz music]

58:07.985 --> 58:09.251
[Duke]<i> Day four was torture.</i>

58:09.253 --> 58:15.791
[Duke]<i> It was 110</i>
<i> in the cactus shade, I was</i>
<i>exhausted before the day began.</i>

58:18.162 --> 58:21.230
Hey, Carl.
Duke slowed down
real bad today.

58:21.966 --> 58:25.000
Something's wrong.
Hey, Wing, get out!

58:26.504 --> 58:28.537
[Sebastian] Five minutes.
You know the rules.

58:29.173 --> 58:33.208
Duke!
[Duke panting]

58:33.210 --> 58:36.278
Don't tell me... You won
another game of charades.

58:36.280 --> 58:38.814
[laughing] No,
I came out for you.

58:38.816 --> 58:42.150
You are very slow today...
What? What happens?

58:42.152 --> 58:44.119
You mean
what's happening, Wing?

58:44.121 --> 58:45.888
I tell
you say "what's happening."

58:45.890 --> 58:47.756
I don't know Wing,
it's a little hot.

58:48.592 --> 58:50.826
My legs,
they feel like cement.
They don't feel good.

58:50.828 --> 58:53.028
[Wing] Uh, oh.
[Duke] Oh, man.

58:53.030 --> 58:55.564
Duke, I'm worried about you.
What? You okay?

58:55.566 --> 58:57.065
Yeah,
I'm okay. I'm okay.

58:58.102 --> 59:00.269
Maybe I'm not.
Maybe I'm not okay.
Alright?

59:00.271 --> 59:04.106
If you ask me, you know,
I think it's your stride.

59:04.108 --> 59:05.807
I don't think
you're walking right.

59:05.809 --> 59:07.876
I'm walking right.
I'm just tired of walking.

59:07.878 --> 59:11.013
You know what, right now
you look very slow.

59:11.015 --> 59:13.215
You know,
you walk like this.
Like a tired creature.

59:13.217 --> 59:17.252
You know
you have to think, like,
a Olympic style speed walker.

59:17.254 --> 59:18.887
You know? Like this.

59:21.025 --> 59:22.291
You look like
you have the runs.

59:22.293 --> 59:23.959
It doesn't matter
what I look like.

59:23.961 --> 59:26.161
This is how the best
walkers move, you know?

59:26.163 --> 59:30.599
Like, uh,
like walking the catwalk
at a fashion show.

59:30.601 --> 59:33.302
Yeah, move
that high knee. Come on,
move that high knee. Let's go!

59:33.304 --> 59:37.806
Yeah! Yes! That's good, okay.
Now add some speed, okay?

59:37.808 --> 59:41.577
Yeah! Like, uh, like
you're a model at a cat ramp.

59:41.579 --> 59:44.580
Okay? Give me some attitude.
Attitude! Ah!

59:44.582 --> 59:46.148
It's not bad!
It's not bad.

59:49.653 --> 59:53.722
And now! Add those arms.
Yes! Like a butterfly! Yes!

59:53.724 --> 59:56.992
Like a butterfly!
Oh, yeah, you're fine!

59:57.928 --> 59:59.595
He's got a fucking trainer.

59:59.597 --> 1:00:01.163
Swing the arms.
I'm good.

1:00:01.165 --> 1:00:03.865
I told you swing the arms.
You're like a butterfly. Okay?

1:00:03.867 --> 1:00:05.167
Yes!
Think like a butterfly.

1:00:05.169 --> 1:00:07.069
Yes, yes, yes. I'm going.
We fly!

1:00:07.071 --> 1:00:08.370
We're swimming.
I'm going.

1:00:08.372 --> 1:00:10.005
We're swimming
on the ground, yes!

1:00:11.709 --> 1:00:14.376
Like De la Renta!
You know, these big legs.

1:00:15.679 --> 1:00:19.748
I feel uncomfortable
within my skin.

1:00:19.750 --> 1:00:21.817
And I feel
like I can't look away.

1:00:22.319 --> 1:00:26.254
Yes! Yes! Like a butterfly!
Oh yeah, you fly!

1:00:26.256 --> 1:00:29.758
Dukey, you fly!
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:32.094
I'm not a butterfly.
You fly!

1:00:32.096 --> 1:00:36.398
But. But. But, wait.
My hips hurt. My hips hurt.

1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:40.335
I know your hips hurt,
but you got to look
sexy like me.

1:00:40.337 --> 1:00:42.971

¶<i> Dadadada</i> ¶

1:00:42.973 --> 1:00:46.008
[Sebastian] Already I look
like Dolph Lundgren's
younger brother.

1:00:46.010 --> 1:00:48.677
Now, take your clothes off.

1:00:51.181 --> 1:00:52.881
I mean, like,
what if he said that?

1:00:54.284 --> 1:00:56.018
What did you mean by that?

1:00:56.020 --> 1:00:57.719
We were goofing on them
doing the voice.

1:00:57.721 --> 1:01:00.439
Why would you say
he's taking his clothes.

1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:03.158
Nobody's taking
their clothes off. Already
it's inappropriate enough.

1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:05.127
Why would one of them be naked?
Don't look at me.

1:01:05.129 --> 1:01:06.862
You say way more
disgusting things than me.

1:01:06.864 --> 1:01:09.831
Hey! Hey! Why would one
of them be naked only?

1:01:10.834 --> 1:01:12.868
I thought
it would be funny that...

1:01:12.870 --> 1:01:15.103
I thought we were doing...
Like doing a bit.

1:01:15.105 --> 1:01:16.805
And one
of them would be naked?

1:01:17.675 --> 1:01:20.042
In the bit.
In the joke.

1:01:22.012 --> 1:01:25.213
[Duke]<i> As the day went on,</i>
<i> I continued on guts alone.</i>

1:01:27.718 --> 1:01:31.953

1:01:49.973 --> 1:01:52.874
[Duke]
<i> How many patriot songs Wing</i>

1:01:52.876 --> 1:01:54.876

1:01:54.878 --> 1:01:57.279
Hurrah! Hurrah!

1:01:57.281 --> 1:02:01.850
[Duke]<i> Who knew Wing majored</i>
<i> in patriotic folk music</i>
<i> in college?</i>

1:02:01.852 --> 1:02:03.351
[Duke]
<i> And was a genius in his field.</i>

[Duke]<i> Speaking</i>

1:02:22.306 --> 1:02:25.140
<i> when word spread back</i>
<i> in Hollywood</i>
<i> about the walk to Vegas bet,</i>

1:02:25.142 --> 1:02:27.743

1:02:35.486 --> 1:02:38.820
[Duke]<i> Squeeze showed</i>

1:02:40.324 --> 1:02:45.127
[Duke]<i> Even Chucky showed up,</i>

<i> in a party bus.</i>

1:02:46.029 --> 1:02:49.297
[Duke]<i> With just a few days</i>

<i> ahead of schedule,</i>

1:02:49.299 --> 1:02:51.133
<i> I decided to press my luck.</i>

1:02:51.135 --> 1:02:57.472
[Duke]<i> I took some Korean herbs</i>
<i>that Wing had been saving for me</i>
<i> for emergencies.</i>

1:02:58.375 --> 1:03:00.542
[Duke]<i> He swore it</i>
<i>would give me tremendous power.</i>

1:03:13.824 --> 1:03:16.558
[Duke]<i> I started thinking</i>
<i> about my wife KC and my son.</i>

1:03:19.062 --> 1:03:21.863
[Duke]<i> I had to win</i>
<i> this bet. For their sake.</i>

1:03:22.499 --> 1:03:25.000
[Duke]<i> Wing's herbs</i>
<i> were making</i>
<i> me feel sentimental.</i>

1:03:26.403 --> 1:03:28.203
[Duke]<i> I took some more.</i>

1:03:30.340 --> 1:03:33.475
[Duke]<i> This was the greatest</i>
<i> day of my entire life!</i>

1:03:37.548 --> 1:03:41.016
[Duke]
<i> Then actress and poker player</i>
<i> Jennifer Tilly showed up.</i>

1:03:42.152 --> 1:03:46.454
[Duke]<i> Along with poker pros</i>
<i> Phil Laak</i>

1:03:50.494 --> 1:03:53.312
No!

1:03:53.313 --> 1:03:56.131
[Duke]<i> This bet was getting</i>
<i> so big, there was</i>
<i> a betting line in Vegas.</i>

1:03:58.836 --> 1:04:02.404
When it comes to prop bets,
you should always
bet on the man.

1:04:02.406 --> 1:04:06.308
[Duke]<i> I was at Wimbledon.</i>
<i> I was down five-two</i>
<i> in the fifth set.</i>

1:04:06.310 --> 1:04:09.110
[Duke]<i> It was ugly.</i>
You cannot be serious!

1:04:09.112 --> 1:04:11.012
I don't think he can do it.

1:04:11.013 --> 1:04:12.913
Can I sell some of my action
to you because I am not
feeling good?

1:04:12.916 --> 1:04:13.882
Yes, I'll take it.

1:04:17.454 --> 1:04:19.588
[Duke]<i> What the hell</i>

1:04:24.361 --> 1:04:26.595
[Duke]<i> Duke's here, yay!</i>

1:04:27.598 --> 1:04:29.364
Duke, I've heard
so much about you.

1:04:29.366 --> 1:04:31.032
This is incredible
what you're doing.

1:04:31.034 --> 1:04:32.467
Thank you.
This is my girl, Jennifer.

1:04:32.469 --> 1:04:34.069
It's an honor.
Hi, Jennifer.

1:04:34.071 --> 1:04:37.138
So nice to meet you.
You are a legend.

1:04:37.140 --> 1:04:38.940
Everybody is
talking about you.

1:04:38.942 --> 1:04:40.976
Far and wide.
Not just the East Coast.

1:04:40.978 --> 1:04:43.144
Talking about you in Europe.
Everywhere, everywhere.

1:04:43.146 --> 1:04:45.080
You can finish
a bet like this.
Do you know why?

1:04:45.082 --> 1:04:46.381
Why?
'Cause you're having fun!

1:04:46.383 --> 1:04:48.950
It's all in
the power of the mind!

1:04:49.453 --> 1:04:52.320
We just wanted to see
how you're feeling
before we put any money down.

1:04:52.322 --> 1:04:53.955
Don't take
any breaks at this point.

1:04:53.957 --> 1:04:55.523
You take a break,
your body will seize up!

1:04:55.525 --> 1:04:57.125
Oh, boy.
How are you feeling?

1:04:57.127 --> 1:05:00.095
Not good.
Oh, we should bet on the...

1:05:00.097 --> 1:05:01.963
Hold up! Hold up!

1:05:03.033 --> 1:05:04.933
I gotta shake your hands.
Oh, okay. Hi.

No!

[traffic light]<i> Wait.</i>
Hey, forget it, man.

1:05:34.031 --> 1:05:35.931
You're worse off than us.

1:05:35.933 --> 1:05:38.466
I know. But I'm going to Vegas.
[traffic light]<i> Walk. Walk.</i>

1:05:40.070 --> 1:05:41.603

Vegas?

You ain't making it

It's over, guys.
I gotta get off this bet.

1:06:30.320 --> 1:06:32.354
What are you talking about?
You're only 90 miles out.

1:06:32.356 --> 1:06:35.023
You're gonna make this easily.
No, man, you don't know.

1:06:35.025 --> 1:06:37.258
My knees are shot.
They're shot.

1:06:39.162 --> 1:06:40.362
It's killing me!

1:06:41.631 --> 1:06:43.665
I'm serious.
I gotta get off the bet.

1:06:43.667 --> 1:06:47.635
Now look, I say
we settle right now.

1:06:47.637 --> 1:06:51.039
You settle for as much
as possible before this thing
gets really bad.

1:06:51.041 --> 1:06:52.407
Well, there he is.

1:06:54.411 --> 1:06:56.711

Fucking freezing in that RV.

1:06:56.713 --> 1:06:59.047
[Sebastian] Hey.
Guys.

1:07:03.453 --> 1:07:05.720
How're you feeling champ?
Good. Pretty good.

1:07:05.722 --> 1:07:07.322
Yeah?
Yeah.

1:07:07.324 --> 1:07:09.357
You look a little shaky
out there, buddy.

1:07:09.359 --> 1:07:11.426
Shaky, no. I'm fine.

1:07:12.462 --> 1:07:14.529
I like it.
Good. Good.

1:07:14.531 --> 1:07:15.764
I've been thinking about it.

1:07:16.533 --> 1:07:18.666
I'm thinking 'cause
we're friends, maybe.

1:07:21.438 --> 1:07:22.737
Maybe I'll be
open to a deal.

1:07:25.208 --> 1:07:26.241
A deal?
Yeah.

1:07:27.144 --> 1:07:29.711
A deal? Why? A deal, man?

1:07:29.713 --> 1:07:32.480
Why would I do a deal?
'Cause you're a dummy.

1:07:32.482 --> 1:07:35.383
I'm ninety miles out.
Got three days to do it,
can probably do it in two.

1:07:35.385 --> 1:07:37.218
So.
Do you think he can do it?

1:07:37.220 --> 1:07:38.420
[Carl]
Yes, he's gonna do it.

1:07:38.422 --> 1:07:39.788
Yeah? You got his back, hm?

1:07:39.790 --> 1:07:41.289
I tell you what.
Hey, look.

1:07:41.291 --> 1:07:45.527
Because I have
this horrible sunburn
and I'm a nice guy.

1:07:46.196 --> 1:07:47.128
You know what?

1:07:48.498 --> 1:07:50.732
You give us
three million bucks.
Not a penny less.

1:07:50.734 --> 1:07:52.400
And we'll think about it.

1:07:56.273 --> 1:07:57.305
Three million?

1:07:58.608 --> 1:08:01.543
I gotta lock.
We're gonna be
in Vegas two days.

1:08:05.182 --> 1:08:06.114
That's it.

1:08:09.653 --> 1:08:12.487
Yeah. Alright. Alright.

1:08:13.523 --> 1:08:15.457
Call it, square.
What do you think?

1:08:15.459 --> 1:08:18.293
Ah, fuck, I don't know.
I suppose so.

1:08:18.295 --> 1:08:20.195
Works out
for everybody. You know?

1:08:20.197 --> 1:08:21.629
Then it's over?
It's a deal?

1:08:21.631 --> 1:08:27.469
Just in time. It's, uh,
a little surprise
I have for you all.

1:08:27.471 --> 1:08:30.472
Just before we
lock this down,
you know, set it in stone.

1:08:31.274 --> 1:08:33.341
Come with me.
You're gonna love it!
Come here!

1:08:38.515 --> 1:08:40.615
Oh. Thank you,
Lawrence. My friend.

1:08:40.617 --> 1:08:47.455
So, guess who I found playing
poker in an Indian casino
down in San Diego?

1:08:48.391 --> 1:08:49.324
Any takers?

1:08:49.826 --> 1:08:52.127
Who's under hood number one?

1:08:54.831 --> 1:08:56.197
Sandor?

1:08:58.535 --> 1:09:00.401
What the fuck is going on?

1:09:01.338 --> 1:09:02.470
Fucking moron.

1:09:02.472 --> 1:09:04.806
He's alive! Thank God!

1:09:04.808 --> 1:09:06.741
Yes, thank God! Thank God.

1:09:06.743 --> 1:09:09.911
Shut the fuck up, Carl.
It's a scam. Don't you
understand that?

1:09:09.913 --> 1:09:12.147
Of course he fucking
understands. He's in on it.

1:09:12.649 --> 1:09:14.415
Oh!
Come on, guys.

1:09:15.285 --> 1:09:16.518
Why did you do that?

1:09:18.221 --> 1:09:20.255
You motherfucker!
You're next!

1:09:20.257 --> 1:09:21.789
Alright,
everybody get back!

1:09:21.791 --> 1:09:25.827
Get out! Go on! You want
it again, you piece of shit?

1:09:25.829 --> 1:09:27.529
You will be dead!

1:09:28.265 --> 1:09:31.199
Get in the bus.
All of you. Move it!

1:09:31.935 --> 1:09:35.170
Come on! Shut the fuck up!

1:09:35.772 --> 1:09:39.440
Who! Whoa! Whoa!
Shut the fuck up!

1:09:40.710 --> 1:09:42.610
So this asshole
is still alive?

1:09:42.612 --> 1:09:45.947
Which means there
ain't no will.
There ain't no mil.

1:09:45.949 --> 1:09:47.749
What were you
betting with, Duke?

1:09:48.919 --> 1:09:49.851
Nothing.

1:09:51.588 --> 1:09:53.655
You were using a fake
escrow guy. Right, Carl?

1:09:54.491 --> 1:09:58.293
Yeah. It's true.
My buddy Max.
Great actor.

1:09:58.295 --> 1:10:00.495
Did a lot of theater.
Crossdresser, actually.

1:10:00.497 --> 1:10:02.297
I don't need
a fucking monologue, Carl!

1:10:06.570 --> 1:10:08.870
You guys were trying
to rob me? I'm insulted.

1:10:08.872 --> 1:10:12.874
Guys, relax. If I lost the bet,
I was gonna get you paid.
I guarantee it.

1:10:13.877 --> 1:10:16.344
What about when you hustled me
with Chuckey's debt? Huh?

1:10:16.346 --> 1:10:19.314
What about
when you made me
climb up that mountain,

1:10:19.316 --> 1:10:21.783
lose six hours
with your cop friend? Huh?

1:10:21.785 --> 1:10:23.885
Whatever happened
to all's fair
in the snake pit?

1:10:25.956 --> 1:10:27.922
I guess he's
kinda got a point.

1:10:27.924 --> 1:10:31.326
Yes. The point is,
is he wasted my time.

1:10:31.328 --> 1:10:33.428
Laid down a bet and he don't
have the money to back it.

1:10:33.430 --> 1:10:34.696
It's insulting.

1:10:34.698 --> 1:10:39.500
I was hustled.
I'm telling you, Duke.
Even I wouldn't go that low.

1:10:40.003 --> 1:10:42.337
[man] Take it easy.
[man 2] Don't do that.

1:10:43.306 --> 1:10:45.340
Step the fuck back!

1:10:45.342 --> 1:10:48.243
[Sebastian]
This fucking bet is over,
and you guys are done.

1:10:49.246 --> 1:10:50.411
I'll back him.

1:10:50.413 --> 1:10:55.250
The dead has risen.
Chucky, you're hammered.
Go back to sleep.

1:10:55.252 --> 1:10:55.984
Why?

1:10:58.488 --> 1:11:00.588
Look, seems to me
this bet could still happen.

1:11:00.590 --> 1:11:03.391
You want to take a walk?
[man] Chucky. Alright.

1:11:04.494 --> 1:11:06.594
[Sebastian]
What the fuck are you
talking about?

1:11:06.997 --> 1:11:09.897
See, Chucky,
you can't blow
your money, man.

1:11:09.899 --> 1:11:11.899
My knee is bad. It's shot.

1:11:11.901 --> 1:11:13.568
Okay, there's
no guarantee out there.

1:11:13.570 --> 1:11:16.037
Hey! His fucking
knees are fine!

1:11:16.039 --> 1:11:17.905
They've been
that way the whole race!

1:11:18.875 --> 1:11:20.341
I'm not worried.

1:11:20.343 --> 1:11:22.577
Okay. No worries.
No worries.

1:11:23.046 --> 1:11:26.814
But the line is no
longer five to one.
It's even money.

1:11:28.318 --> 1:11:31.052
So tell me big boy,
can you get five million
by the morning?

1:11:32.822 --> 1:11:34.856
Yeah. Can you?

1:11:34.858 --> 1:11:37.492
Can I? It's in the van.
My boys just collected it.

1:11:38.361 --> 1:11:42.430
Wait a minute.
There ain't no free ride
for this guy here.

1:11:42.432 --> 1:11:43.931
Chucky, you're down
for four mil.

1:11:43.933 --> 1:11:45.967
But the last mil
is on Duke here.

1:11:45.969 --> 1:11:47.935
[Wing] What?
[Angry] Yeah.

1:11:47.937 --> 1:11:49.704
He's gotta
have pain in this game.

1:11:49.706 --> 1:11:51.939
Are you kidding?
I'm broke.
You know that.

1:11:51.941 --> 1:11:54.776
A few seconds ago,
you had a way to cover it.

1:11:54.778 --> 1:11:58.313
Now you're broke.
That's your fucking problem.

1:11:58.315 --> 1:12:00.381
Bad shit's gonna happen
if you stiff me.

1:12:01.551 --> 1:12:04.485
[Sebastian] Alright then.
Bet's back on.
Five million dollars.

1:12:06.022 --> 1:12:06.988
That's it.

1:12:06.989 --> 1:12:07.955
A game of poker?
Huh? Come on.

1:12:08.892 --> 1:12:10.992
You fucks have balls,
I'll give you that.

1:12:14.364 --> 1:12:15.697
You're
crazier than I thought.

1:12:17.100 --> 1:12:18.466
I'm an actor.

1:12:18.468 --> 1:12:22.704
Besides, you said only
bums don't come back.
I'm betting you're not a bum.

1:12:27.577 --> 1:12:28.910
[Angry]
We're gonna win, right?

1:12:30.080 --> 1:12:32.046
Listen. His knees. Shot.

1:12:32.048 --> 1:12:35.650
His feet no good.
That's real. He's done.

1:12:36.453 --> 1:12:40.521
Tomorrow's gonna be
about one-twenty, so there's
a good chance he might die.

1:12:40.957 --> 1:12:42.023
God willing.

1:12:49.866 --> 1:12:53.000
[Duke]<i> Ninety miles</i>

<i> I was ready.</i>

1:12:54.537 --> 1:12:58.940

1:13:04.147 --> 1:13:07.582

1:13:15.759 --> 1:13:19.961

1:13:19.963 --> 1:13:21.095

1:13:21.731 --> 1:13:23.664

1:13:37.680 --> 1:13:41.983

1:13:57.434 --> 1:14:01.836
[Duke]<i> I woke</i>

1:14:09.946 --> 1:14:12.013
[Duke]<i> Day seven.</i>

[Duke]<i> Twenty-five</i>

[Sebastian]<i> It's over.</i>

[KC]<i> We got our lives back</i>

1:14:52.822 --> 1:14:55.490
No!
[KC]<i> You're on your own.</i>

1:14:55.492 --> 1:14:57.558
Stay away!
[KC]<i> This is without me.</i>

1:14:57.560 --> 1:14:59.494
[KC]<i> Be a big man.</i>

1:15:30.927 --> 1:15:32.093
How're you doing there?

1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:38.666
You're gonna have to say it.

1:15:41.137 --> 1:15:42.136
You're done.

1:15:50.547 --> 1:15:51.279
Oh.

1:15:53.683 --> 1:15:55.850
Oh. I'm done.

1:15:55.852 --> 1:16:00.588
[cheering and laughing]

1:16:00.590 --> 1:16:03.791
With only twelve miles to go!

1:16:03.793 --> 1:16:06.928
Duke Madson cannot
answer the bell.

1:16:06.930 --> 1:16:08.696
[laughing]

1:16:08.698 --> 1:16:11.265
Alright kids,
what do you say?
Little drinking?

1:16:11.267 --> 1:16:14.569
[cheering]
Hold on everyone! Hold on.

1:16:14.571 --> 1:16:16.671
You might want to hold off
on your celebration.

1:16:16.673 --> 1:16:18.139
What'chu
talkin' bout, Willis?

1:16:18.141 --> 1:16:20.174
[Sebastian] Pour the drink.
[Angry] Please.

1:16:20.176 --> 1:16:23.044
[Angry] What you talking about?
[man] Come on. Alright.

1:16:24.347 --> 1:16:27.114
It's not quite over yet.
What are you talking about?

1:16:27.116 --> 1:16:29.283
I have this.
What the hell are you
talking about Carl?

1:16:29.285 --> 1:16:31.152
I'm talking
about the Jack Binion clause.

1:16:32.855 --> 1:16:35.990
Binion. He's right!
He is right!

1:16:35.992 --> 1:16:38.326
Sit the fuck down.
He's just conceded.

1:16:38.328 --> 1:16:40.161
No, he said "he's done."

1:16:40.163 --> 1:16:42.630
And according
to the Binion clause,

1:16:42.632 --> 1:16:46.200
it says that anyone in the RV
in the last 25 miles
can take his place.

1:16:46.202 --> 1:16:48.336
So we're not done yet.
Yeah! That's right!

1:16:48.338 --> 1:16:49.971
[Wing] Exactly.
[Squeeze] Right!

1:16:51.841 --> 1:16:54.308
Alright.
Alright, yeah. Okay.

1:16:54.310 --> 1:16:59.947
It's in here, but it also does
state that I get to choose
who replaces him.

1:17:00.617 --> 1:17:04.218
And I can pick
anyone in this RV. Huh?

1:17:04.854 --> 1:17:07.955
I'm ready.
Anybody I want.

1:17:09.859 --> 1:17:11.025
[Sebastian] Anybody.

1:17:12.695 --> 1:17:15.863
And I pick you, Carl.
[Wing] What? No!

1:17:15.865 --> 1:17:17.365
[laughing] Oh!

1:17:18.134 --> 1:17:20.801
You can't do that.
It's not fair.

1:17:20.803 --> 1:17:23.638
Hey! You, shut it.
Alright? Zip it.

1:17:23.640 --> 1:17:25.339
You'll be dead
in like three minutes.
Relax.

1:17:25.341 --> 1:17:28.342
The man's on crutches!
He's a gimp. He can't even walk!

1:17:28.344 --> 1:17:30.745
[Sebastian] So, Carl,
what's it gonna be?

1:17:30.747 --> 1:17:32.313
Can you get
your ass out there?

1:17:32.315 --> 1:17:34.949
If not, you quit,
just like your brother did.

1:17:36.886 --> 1:17:39.353
Fucking hustler, huh?
I've been called worse.

1:17:39.355 --> 1:17:40.755
Tick-tock.

1:17:43.693 --> 1:17:45.693
Okay. Okay.
Yeah?

1:17:45.695 --> 1:17:48.329
Chop, chop, Sunshine,
cause we've got a...

1:17:48.331 --> 1:17:52.833
Hey don't get all
butt hurt on us,
okay, there, sticky boy?

1:17:52.835 --> 1:17:55.302
It's a lot of cobblestones
out there as well. Go easy.

1:17:55.304 --> 1:17:56.704
[Wing] Good luck, Carl.

1:18:02.045 --> 1:18:04.779
[Hank] You can do it.
You can do it.

1:18:05.281 --> 1:18:07.882
Bro, that's ill advised.

1:18:07.884 --> 1:18:10.451
Look at that little
name dropper go!

1:18:10.453 --> 1:18:13.154
Hey, don't get
too excited, alright?

1:18:15.324 --> 1:18:18.693
He's got twelve miles to go
and three hours to do it in.

1:18:18.695 --> 1:18:20.094
It's basically impossible.

1:18:21.130 --> 1:18:23.097
Really?
Yeah.

1:18:25.935 --> 1:18:27.902
What are the odds
on impossible?

1:18:28.337 --> 1:18:31.005
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1:18:31.007 --> 1:18:34.241
Look, that gimp has no chance.
Wait, wait, wait. Shh!

1:18:34.243 --> 1:18:36.377
He's a big boy.
He knows what he's doing.

1:18:38.881 --> 1:18:41.148
Feeling frisky?
Are you lush? Huh?

1:18:42.085 --> 1:18:46.253
Give you five to one on it.
Oh! Don't do it. Don't do it.

1:18:46.255 --> 1:18:47.922
I'm in.
[Wing] What?

1:18:48.791 --> 1:18:49.957
Three million more.

1:18:50.860 --> 1:18:53.260
Three million?
To your fifteen.

1:18:54.864 --> 1:18:56.864
Fucking hell! He's got
some balls, isn't he?

1:18:58.201 --> 1:19:00.935
I like it! My man knows
how to gamble! I'm in!

1:19:00.937 --> 1:19:02.103
Yeah, baby.
[Wing] Okay.

1:19:06.509 --> 1:19:11.145
[Duke]<i> With the extra</i>
<i> money bet, eight million</i>
<i> on me and Carl now.</i>

1:19:11.981 --> 1:19:13.914
<i> Sebastian was</i>
<i> in for twenty.</i>

1:19:14.884 --> 1:19:16.517
<i> And it didn't look good.</i>

1:19:31.434 --> 1:19:33.534
<i> As time went on,</i>
<i> it was apparent.</i>

1:19:34.804 --> 1:19:36.437
[Duke]<i> Carl wasn't</i>
<i> going to make it.</i>

1:19:37.373 --> 1:19:39.940
This is not right, Sebastian.
The man has no chance.

1:19:40.943 --> 1:19:43.244
[Duke]<i> Everyone wanted</i>
<i> the bleeding to stop.</i>

1:19:43.246 --> 1:19:46.514
<i> Wing and Sandor wanted</i>
<i> to settle for eighty cents</i>

1:19:47.150 --> 1:19:50.317
<i> But Sebastian declined.</i>
<i> He wanted all their money.</i>

1:19:55.458 --> 1:19:59.126
Chucky, get your dough ready.
No one beats me,
huh, big man?

1:20:03.132 --> 1:20:06.433
[Duke]
<i> Then, something</i>
<i> happened to Carl.</i>

1:20:08.204 --> 1:20:12.439
<i> A determination</i>
<i> I hadn't seen since he stole</i>
<i> my girlfriend in ninth grade.</i>

1:20:40.403 --> 1:20:44.338
What the fuck's
he doing now?
Moving like that?

1:20:44.340 --> 1:20:46.207
[Angry] You gotta be
fuckin' kidding me.

1:20:48.377 --> 1:20:52.012
What heart,
what determination
from the name dropper.

1:20:52.014 --> 1:20:54.415
Now shut
that fucking puppet up,
will you? Fucking shit.

1:20:57.186 --> 1:21:00.855
Is this possible?
Can the gimp
really be doing this?

1:21:02.892 --> 1:21:05.226
[Duke]
<i> Five and a half miles</i>
<i> outside of Vegas,</i>

1:21:05.228 --> 1:21:09.597
<i> with only 42 minutes left,</i>
<i> Carl was still pushing hard.</i>

1:21:13.936 --> 1:21:17.137
Ah! Ah-ha, yeah!

1:21:29.485 --> 1:21:31.118
[Angry]
He's quitting. It's over.

1:21:33.389 --> 1:21:34.655
[Angry] It's over!

1:21:35.458 --> 1:21:37.157
[Angry] Show me
the money, baby.

1:21:39.595 --> 1:21:41.262
[Angry] What the fuck
is he doing?

1:21:51.107 --> 1:21:53.140
[Wing] Ey... There...

1:21:53.142 --> 1:21:57.278
[cheering]

1:21:57.280 --> 1:22:01.115
He's sprinting?
Now he's
fucking sprinting!

1:22:01.117 --> 1:22:03.083
How can he be
doing that?

1:22:10.226 --> 1:22:12.326
[Wing]
He's three miles out!
He can make it!

1:22:16.999 --> 1:22:18.632
[Wing]
He's only got
two miles to go! Go!

1:22:20.569 --> 1:22:23.037
Move it!
Ah!

1:22:30.346 --> 1:22:31.412
Go!

1:22:33.249 --> 1:22:36.517
[Duke]
I see the Vegas sign.
Sprint, Carl. Sprint!

1:22:36.519 --> 1:22:38.585
[Duke] Yeah!
[Wing] Yeah!

1:22:41.090 --> 1:22:42.056
Yeah! Yeah!

1:22:46.595 --> 1:22:48.329
[Duke]
He's done it! He's done it!

1:22:48.331 --> 1:22:53.167
[cheering]

1:23:07.750 --> 1:23:11.218
[Duke]<i> When Sebastian</i>

1:23:11.220 --> 1:23:14.288

You had to cut it
to the last minute, huh?

1:23:40.583 --> 1:23:42.750
Thought I'd make it
look interesting.

1:23:42.752 --> 1:23:45.619
Besides, I thought
I'd give us a chance
to get more action.

1:23:49.558 --> 1:23:50.524
Here's your cut.

1:23:53.796 --> 1:23:55.329
A million bucks.

1:23:58.501 --> 1:23:59.566
[Duke] What're you
gonna do with it?

1:23:59.568 --> 1:24:03.070
Definitely gonna
hang around here
for a few days.

1:24:03.072 --> 1:24:04.304
Roll the dice with it.

1:24:06.075 --> 1:24:07.741
I'm gonna turn this
into ten mil.

1:24:10.646 --> 1:24:13.380
Ever tell you
about the time I played
craps all night long

1:24:13.382 --> 1:24:15.215
with Johnny Depp
in this very hotel?

1:24:15.217 --> 1:24:17.351
It's back when he was
doing 21 Jump...

1:24:17.353 --> 1:24:18.452
Hey! Hey!

1:24:19.155 --> 1:24:21.155
Hey,
Johnny's my best friend!

1:24:21.157 --> 1:24:22.823
A toast! Yes!

1:24:24.093 --> 1:24:26.193
[Duke]
<i> It took Carl three years</i>
<i> to set up his mark.</i>

1:24:26.662 --> 1:24:29.196
So you're telling me
you're gonna walk around
on crutches

1:24:29.198 --> 1:24:32.699
for who knows how long
just to set one
of these guys up?

1:24:36.338 --> 1:24:37.538
Yep.

1:24:37.540 --> 1:24:39.073
Alright, a toast.

1:24:39.442 --> 1:24:42.543
To my brother Carl.
We did it!

1:24:42.545 --> 1:24:46.513
Twenty million!
[everyone] Yeah!

1:24:47.283 --> 1:24:49.516
Hello.
Sandor is dead.

1:24:50.419 --> 1:24:53.720
Wait for it.
Wait for it! Emotion!

1:24:53.722 --> 1:24:54.655
What?

1:25:03.699 --> 1:25:05.365
Who's crushing it?

1:25:05.367 --> 1:25:09.603
Okay, guys!
Pops is leaving!
I love you!

1:25:09.605 --> 1:25:10.804
Fuck you!

1:25:10.806 --> 1:25:16.577
Oh, honey, I'm sorry
I was cussing. You know
that we're just acting, right?

1:25:17.546 --> 1:25:18.779
You want
a hot fudge sundae?

1:25:20.282 --> 1:25:22.783
We are,
and we always will.

1:25:29.725 --> 1:25:32.759
Well,
we still have each other.

1:25:37.700 --> 1:25:41.168
[Duke] Yeah, let's hear it
for Chucky birds!
What a performance!

1:25:43.339 --> 1:25:47.374
Look. Carl does not really
need crutches. It's a sting.

1:25:48.210 --> 1:25:49.143
You in?

1:25:55.851 --> 1:25:57.918
[Wing] Duke just inherited
a million dollars!

1:26:00.723 --> 1:26:02.789
[Duke]<i> I never did</i>
<i> go back to the big game.</i>

1:26:02.791 --> 1:26:04.925
<i> With the five million I won,</i>

1:26:04.927 --> 1:26:07.928
<i> with Chucky's four million</i>
<i> dollar free roll incentive,</i>

1:26:07.930 --> 1:26:12.299
<i> I spent more time</i>
<i> with my wife and my son</i>
<i> and never looked back.</i>

1:26:13.636 --> 1:26:16.703
<i> Then I landed</i>
<i> a great gig as a poker host</i>
<i> of a big show.</i>

1:26:17.473 --> 1:26:19.640
<i> And I've</i>
<i> been doing it ever since.</i>

1:26:22.745 --> 1:26:25.279
<i> Now,</i>
<i> the big game's behind me.</i>

1:26:25.281 --> 1:26:28.182
<i> And the poker needle</i>
<i> slowly disappears.</i>

1:26:28.184 --> 1:26:29.950
<i> I don't miss</i>
<i> it much either.</i>

1:26:30.953 --> 1:26:33.420
<i> But not a day goes by</i>
<i> that I don't think</i>

1:26:33.422 --> 1:26:36.623
<i> about that bet in the desert</i>
<i> and what we pulled off.</i>

1:26:36.625 --> 1:26:41.862
