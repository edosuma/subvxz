WEBVTT

00:01.759 --> 00:05.004
- What have you done, Katy?
- It's over, so it doesn't matter.

00:05.040 --> 00:07.709
- Please don't leave!
- What happened?

00:07.745 --> 00:09.345
Why don't you ask your wife?

00:09.682 --> 00:11.187
You do believe me, don't you?

00:12.015 --> 00:14.445
You believe that I couldn't
do something like that?

00:14.480 --> 00:16.720
Yeah. Course I do.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.805
I'm just a rubbish collector.
I don't change anything.

00:19.841 --> 00:23.404
I just sweep up the crap and the
next day it's all just there again.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.680
What you do is important, it makes
a difference to people.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.480
It's one of the reasons
I fell for you in the first place.

00:28.520 --> 00:33.440
All I care about is him
answering for what he's done.

00:33.480 --> 00:35.717
We're gonna find proof
that you raped me!

00:36.050 --> 00:38.890
No, you won't, Detective. No, you won't.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.530
Dad? What's going on?

01:35.691 --> 01:38.680
Ah, I'm sorry, mate.
I didn't mean to wake you up.

01:38.896 --> 01:41.496
Where have you been?

01:41.532 --> 01:43.167
You won't believe me if I told you.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.270
It's not important.

01:49.084 --> 01:51.255
All you need to know is, though, er...

01:51.640 --> 01:53.107
it's not over.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.480
- What?
- The police.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.831
I don't understand it,
they just won't let it lie.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.800
It wasn't enough that your teacher

02:00.840 --> 02:03.575
made all those accusations
against me, now the detective...

02:03.771 --> 02:05.243
Dad, what's going on?

02:07.989 --> 02:12.532
The detective is accusing me, too.
She's saying that I attacked her.

02:12.568 --> 02:15.684
She's saying that a couple of nights ago

02:15.720 --> 02:18.880
- I broke into her house.
- That's crazy. I mean,

02:18.920 --> 02:21.958
you already proved that
Miss Nielson was lying before...

02:22.100 --> 02:25.540
People can't just go around saying
this stuff, Dad. It's not right.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.400
Tell her boss. There must be
someone who can make this stop.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.800
The police, you see,
they look after their own.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.267
That's how they work.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.205
Whatever she says, they'll back her up.

02:35.312 --> 02:37.632
It's just her word against mine.

02:38.872 --> 02:40.299
And I'll be destroyed.

02:43.679 --> 02:45.301
Unless er...

02:46.048 --> 02:48.888
I don't know. What er...
What if maybe er...

02:48.924 --> 02:50.689
you told them that you saw me?

02:52.080 --> 02:53.951
You want me to lie to the police?

02:54.123 --> 02:57.080
No, no, no. God, nothing like that.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.351
Just erm...

03:00.000 --> 03:01.305
I need your help.

03:01.758 --> 03:04.840
You know, in the same way that I
helped you with Makeda's father?

03:04.880 --> 03:06.619
The kind of lie that's a good lie?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.260
Look, mate...

03:16.180 --> 03:20.120
..I feel sick to my stomach
asking you, all right?

03:21.340 --> 03:23.020
But I'm afraid.

03:25.682 --> 03:28.091
To be honest with you, mate,
I'm really scared.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.593
They want blood and...

03:31.940 --> 03:35.140
..they'll... they won't
stop at anything.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.920
Christ, if I can't protect myself,
who's gonna protect you?

03:46.440 --> 03:47.760
Oh, God.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.265
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.240
I'm so sorry, just
forget that I asked, OK?

03:54.964 --> 03:56.503
Forget that I asked.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.960
I'm so embarrassed. Please forgive me.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.480
I'm so sorry that I asked, OK?
Just forget about it. I'm so sorry.

04:02.520 --> 04:04.788
Christ, what's happening to me?
I can't even...

04:13.920 --> 04:15.700
Whatever you need, Dad.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.420
I'll tell them whatever you need.

04:20.579 --> 04:22.340
I'm not gonna let them do this to you.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.200
Thank you.

04:25.340 --> 04:27.160
Oh, my God, thank you.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.380
Thanks, mate.

04:44.149 --> 04:46.550
What makes you think
it'll be different this time?

04:46.876 --> 04:48.976
What makes you think
you can put him away?

04:49.347 --> 04:51.907
You need to let me worry
about Andrew Earlham.

04:55.840 --> 04:59.040
- Will you call me as soon as you...
- As soon as we press charges.

05:00.588 --> 05:01.907
I promise.

05:05.087 --> 05:06.607
- OK.
- OK.

06:02.952 --> 06:05.154
_

06:24.527 --> 06:26.257
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:29.651 --> 06:32.771
- How was the journey down?
- Good. Really easy. Thanks.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.920
- You really should have let me come to you.
- Oh, no, no, no.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.920
This is nice.
I always wanted to come here.

06:42.997 --> 06:44.350
You look good.

06:45.139 --> 06:47.652
Not that you don't always look good.

06:47.850 --> 06:50.470
Thanks.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.520
OK. Er, drinks.

06:54.560 --> 06:57.048
- What can I get you?
- Oh erm...

06:57.284 --> 06:59.922
Actually, I'll get them,
if you don't mind.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.427
Please. Let me.

07:02.877 --> 07:03.977
OK.

07:07.300 --> 07:09.700
Go on. Run, run, run, run.

07:09.740 --> 07:11.740
Run!

07:13.800 --> 07:15.674
No, no, you're staying there.

07:16.760 --> 07:20.160
Yeah, there's my boys.
Did you have a good time?

07:20.200 --> 07:21.819
Did you have fun?

07:21.994 --> 07:25.514
Go on, I've got tea ready for you.
I'll be with you in a second.

07:28.854 --> 07:32.543
So they kept asking
if I was going to stay.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.284
Yeah. Well, it's er...

07:35.399 --> 07:37.780
it's gonna take some time
for them to get used to it.

07:38.580 --> 07:39.835
But they will.

07:40.844 --> 07:42.147
They don't have to.

07:43.590 --> 07:45.344
You did this, Katy.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.880
- No-one else.
- All I'm asking

07:47.920 --> 07:50.160
is that we try, for them.

07:52.051 --> 07:55.387
I don't want them growing up being
pulled in two different directions,

07:55.423 --> 07:57.826
- caught in the middle...
- And I don't want that either.

07:58.364 --> 07:59.834
But what you did...

08:01.402 --> 08:02.889
..I can't forget that.

08:03.605 --> 08:05.066
Or forgive it.

08:06.835 --> 08:09.075
Daddy's coming.

08:13.116 --> 08:14.778
See you on Tuesday.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.400
So I was on the Tube and I offered
my seat to this, erm, lady,

08:44.440 --> 08:47.240
and she said, "Why?"

08:47.280 --> 08:49.556
And I said,
"Well, because you're pregnant."

08:49.592 --> 08:52.272
- And she said, "I'm not pregnant."
- Oh, my God.

08:52.440 --> 08:55.720
- What did you say?
- I couldn't think of anything to say.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.040
I mean, she looked pregnant.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.520
From the shape of it.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.103
I was really sure...

09:01.139 --> 09:04.070
Maybe she just thought
you were being chivalrous.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.574
By offering my seat to a fat person?

09:08.218 --> 09:11.178
So now whenever I'm on a train
and I see someone standing,

09:11.214 --> 09:13.318
I have a million thoughts
going through my head.

09:13.354 --> 09:16.354
Are they not actually pregnant?
Are they not that old?

09:16.620 --> 09:19.260
Are they not even a woman?

09:19.296 --> 09:24.536
- It's a minefield.
- Aw. It's not fair, though, is it?

09:24.800 --> 09:27.340
You were just trying to do
something nice and...

09:28.699 --> 09:30.739
What? What is it?

09:32.195 --> 09:34.318
What is it? Who is that?

09:40.423 --> 09:41.991
Laura, is that him?

09:45.040 --> 09:46.960
It doesn't matter.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.820
Jesus.

09:52.540 --> 09:54.840
He was investigated
a second time, right?

09:56.480 --> 10:00.080
Police turned his life upside down
and found precisely nothing.

10:00.210 --> 10:01.750
They just let him go?

10:03.520 --> 10:05.531
Even after DI Harmon's charges,

10:05.567 --> 10:07.488
they couldn't find anything
to put him away.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.360
He knows how to cover his tracks,
I suppose.

10:12.828 --> 10:15.662
I can't imagine what it must feel
like to see him walking around.

10:16.132 --> 10:19.052
Well, I've been angry
for long time, but erm...

10:20.405 --> 10:21.813
..it wastes you.

10:23.030 --> 10:25.530
It eats away at you and erm...

10:27.120 --> 10:28.680
..every time I feel that way,

10:28.720 --> 10:30.960
it's like it's happening all over again,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.618
so at some point you have to...
let it go or...

10:35.300 --> 10:37.340
try to, at least.

10:39.520 --> 10:40.880
Here's to you.

10:45.961 --> 10:49.364
- So how much longer?
- A month.

10:50.437 --> 10:54.200
- Have you found a new place yet?
- No. Sensible, hey?

10:56.120 --> 10:59.029
I just felt like getting the hell
out of this place was the priority,

10:59.562 --> 11:02.240
but everything I look at,
all I see is the bad stuff,

11:02.280 --> 11:04.680
too small, too close to a road.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.665
One place was too yellow.

11:06.884 --> 11:08.964
That's a deal breaker.

11:10.635 --> 11:12.595
Thanks for a lovely night.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.320
Yeah, it was really good seeing you.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.880
I'm sorry. You've come all this way

11:18.920 --> 11:21.794
- and I'm not even inviting you in.
- No, no, not at all.

11:34.835 --> 11:36.196
See you next week?

11:36.712 --> 11:38.264
Next week it is.

11:38.838 --> 11:40.321
Good night, Ian.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.587
Good night, Laura.

12:18.640 --> 12:21.519
One drink. There's a beautiful
little pub just round the corner.

12:21.555 --> 12:23.600
You've been on enough dates with me now.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.400
Do you think I'm easily persuaded?

12:25.440 --> 12:27.040
At least I tried.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.287
But next time, dinner,
I'll cook, I insist.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.955
If I make my salmon en croute,

12:31.991 --> 12:34.628
maybe my son will bugger off and
we'll have a moment to ourselves.

12:36.517 --> 12:38.557
- All right, then.
- Yes.

12:38.593 --> 12:39.905
Good night.

12:40.871 --> 12:42.230
Good night.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.539
OK, good night.

12:59.325 --> 13:00.851
Till next time.

13:48.950 --> 13:50.510
Charlotte? Hi.

13:51.408 --> 13:53.184
I'm Laura Nielson.

13:55.230 --> 13:57.283
I appreciate you coming.

13:59.180 --> 14:01.325
You should know Andrew
told me about you.

14:02.390 --> 14:04.345
What did he say exactly?

14:05.399 --> 14:06.629
He told me,

14:06.751 --> 14:09.790
the first time I met him, about
all the trouble you'd caused him.

14:10.631 --> 14:13.110
He deleted all of his social media
accounts after that,

14:13.150 --> 14:16.110
set up a new one under an alias
and yet you still found him.

14:16.150 --> 14:17.589
And me.

14:18.230 --> 14:19.902
Should I be worried about you?

14:24.434 --> 14:26.455
Andrew Earlham raped me.

14:27.226 --> 14:29.613
He raped a police officer
called Vanessa Harmon,

14:29.782 --> 14:33.050
and he raped a woman called
Catherine MacAulay in Edinburgh.

14:34.950 --> 14:36.412
Here are their numbers.

14:36.830 --> 14:39.123
If you don't believe me,
then talk to them.

14:39.975 --> 14:42.910
Then you make up your mind
who you think is telling the truth,

14:42.950 --> 14:44.665
the three of us or Andrew.

14:46.547 --> 14:49.410
Look, I don't know you, but I know him,

14:49.446 --> 14:51.670
and I know what he's capable of.

14:51.710 --> 14:54.977
He likes women who are
smart, independent,

14:55.422 --> 14:57.413
more of a challenge to control.

14:57.990 --> 15:00.432
I'm hoping you're smart enough
to watch your back.

15:01.670 --> 15:03.000
Or at least...

15:03.190 --> 15:06.274
smart enough to check out what
I'm telling you for yourself.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.990
Aw. She's gorgeous.

15:24.710 --> 15:25.775
Is she?

15:25.811 --> 15:28.230
Yeah, look, she's even got
your see-through head.

15:28.270 --> 15:29.914
That's if she is a she.

15:31.710 --> 15:32.916
Are you all right?

15:33.470 --> 15:35.030
Yeah, I'm just...

15:35.070 --> 15:36.576
miles away.

15:36.790 --> 15:38.996
You have been since I got back.

15:39.430 --> 15:41.950
Look, it's...
it's one more tour of duty,

15:41.990 --> 15:44.790
- and then I'm home, right?
- No more GI Jennifer.

15:45.030 --> 15:47.983
I'll be back before the birth
and then I'm not going anywhere.

15:49.059 --> 15:51.150
Yeah. I just miss you, that's all.

15:51.190 --> 15:53.230
You can't lie to me, Ness.

15:53.416 --> 15:55.430
What's going on? You've got that look.

15:55.470 --> 15:57.630
- It's nothing.
- Look...

15:57.670 --> 16:01.110
I can keep asking you again again
till I drive you crazy

16:01.150 --> 16:03.510
- or you can just tell me now.
- Just leave it, okay? I am fine.

16:03.550 --> 16:04.910
Just tell me.

16:07.750 --> 16:09.070
Ness...

16:09.870 --> 16:11.350
you've changed.

16:11.390 --> 16:13.308
You've tried to pretend, but...

16:13.719 --> 16:15.000
but I know what...

16:15.554 --> 16:17.901
All I'm asking for is the truth.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.926
Is there someone else?

16:21.603 --> 16:24.183
God, no. Of course not.

16:24.470 --> 16:26.309
Well, then, what is it?

16:27.950 --> 16:31.150
While you were away,
something happened, but please...

16:31.190 --> 16:33.950
please, I can't,
I don't want to say it out loud.

16:33.990 --> 16:36.550
Whatever it is, it's OK.

16:36.885 --> 16:39.870
You can tell me.
You can tell me, what is it?

16:39.910 --> 16:42.190
What is it?

16:43.190 --> 16:44.590
Just tell me.

16:46.310 --> 16:47.482
Luke?

16:48.140 --> 16:49.552
Luke?

16:58.110 --> 16:59.445
Hey, mate.

17:00.547 --> 17:02.667
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

17:04.670 --> 17:05.752
Good.

17:07.597 --> 17:08.733
That's good.

17:10.150 --> 17:11.550
Hey, er...

17:11.589 --> 17:13.310
I was wondering...

17:17.829 --> 17:20.365
..how's school, eh?

17:25.390 --> 17:27.510
Just because the charges were dropped,

17:27.550 --> 17:29.670
doesn't mean people don't talk, right?

17:30.986 --> 17:33.470
I know how hard it is but it's
not gonna get any easier -

17:33.510 --> 17:36.430
Spare me the advice, Dad.
Like you're in any position.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.116
What do you mean?

17:44.516 --> 17:46.596
What does that mean? Luke?

17:46.632 --> 17:48.072
I was cleared.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.791
All those charges,
not one of them stuck.

17:53.069 --> 17:55.578
If you don't believe me,
right, you and me...

18:02.430 --> 18:04.144
If you...

18:07.098 --> 18:09.550
Charlotte. Hey. How are you?

18:10.390 --> 18:12.550
Slow down, slow down.

18:13.750 --> 18:14.894
What?

18:16.430 --> 18:17.654
What?

18:22.710 --> 18:24.316
What did she say?

19:07.110 --> 19:08.485
What do you want?

19:10.030 --> 19:12.488
<i>I want to talk, Laura.
What else would I want?</i>

19:13.830 --> 19:15.614
You need to leave me alone.

19:16.270 --> 19:17.867
<i>Bit early to be in bed, isn't it?</i>

19:21.805 --> 19:23.310
What did you say?

19:23.350 --> 19:25.821
<i>Do you think about me?
When you're lying there.</i>

19:27.510 --> 19:30.790
<i>You do, don't you?
Even though you wouldn't admit it.</i>

19:30.830 --> 19:33.459
You need to get away from here
right now.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.510
<i>I know you spoke to Charlotte,</i>

19:35.550 --> 19:38.495
<i>and I think you're the one
that needs to back off.</i>

19:39.112 --> 19:41.577
<i>Time we both got on with our lives,
don't you think?</i>

19:42.230 --> 19:45.836
You think you stand above everyone
and everything, don't you?

19:46.416 --> 19:48.144
That you're untouchable.

19:48.510 --> 19:50.790
But you're just a man, Andrew.

19:51.056 --> 19:53.056
A sick, weak man.

19:53.523 --> 19:55.670
And one day you're gonna wake up

19:55.710 --> 19:59.030
and all the pain you've caused
is just gonna come back on you.

20:04.150 --> 20:07.070
You sound scared. Don't be.

20:08.310 --> 20:10.173
Cos if I wanted to have you...

20:10.510 --> 20:11.787
again...

20:12.150 --> 20:14.458
don't you think I could have
had you whenever I wanted?

20:14.790 --> 20:17.818
- I'm calling the police.
- <i>Do you ever think about that night?</i>

20:18.830 --> 20:20.117
<i>I know I do.</i>

20:21.507 --> 20:24.470
<i>The floral-patterned sheets,
the pink pillowcases,</i>

20:24.510 --> 20:26.350
<i>the grey throw on the bed,</i>

20:26.390 --> 20:28.710
<i>which couldn't have been more
than a few weeks old.</i>

20:28.750 --> 20:31.623
<i>One of the tags was still hanging
from the bottom right-hand corner.</i>

20:32.130 --> 20:34.490
<i>And you... lying there.</i>

20:36.430 --> 20:38.357
<i>Letting me do whatever I wanted.</i>

20:39.418 --> 20:42.350
<i>I play that back, Laura,
whenever I get the chance.</i>

20:46.030 --> 20:48.390
<i>All right, I'll see you soon.</i>

21:08.324 --> 21:09.459
<i>Laura?</i>

21:09.495 --> 21:12.288
Andrew turned up outside
my house last night.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.720
- What?
- <i>Yeah, he didn't do anything.</i>

21:15.756 --> 21:18.670
<i>He just wanted to scare me,
and it worked.</i>

21:18.710 --> 21:20.119
<i>I couldn't sleep all night.</i>

21:22.590 --> 21:24.023
<i>OK.</i>

21:24.596 --> 21:26.270
I think he filmed us.

21:26.642 --> 21:28.156
What he did to us.

21:29.590 --> 21:31.155
Why would you say that?

21:32.070 --> 21:35.195
He talked about that night.
He talked about erm...

21:35.630 --> 21:37.573
a picture on my wall...

21:38.197 --> 21:41.790
some tiny detail about my bed,
little things...

21:41.830 --> 21:45.150
that he couldn't have noticed
in the time he was in my room.

21:45.190 --> 21:47.310
- He had time to look around.
- He said...

21:47.350 --> 21:49.870
"I play that back whenever
I get the chance."

21:49.910 --> 21:52.190
Not "I think about it",
"I play it back."

21:52.230 --> 21:55.750
- Could just be an expression.
- <i>The things he said, the detail...</i>

21:55.786 --> 21:57.998
I'm telling you, he recorded it

21:58.034 --> 22:00.093
and the sick bastard
still has it somewhere.

22:00.129 --> 22:00.969
Laura.

22:01.004 --> 22:03.870
<i>Men like him want to control
and humiliate women.</i>

22:03.910 --> 22:06.910
- What's more humiliating than a recording?
- <i>Stop.</i>

22:07.063 --> 22:10.623
<i>We searched his house,
his work, his computer.</i>

22:10.659 --> 22:13.710
Every electronic device he has, OK?

22:13.750 --> 22:15.870
- And we found nothing.
- <i>I know.</i>

22:15.910 --> 22:20.550
- But he's too smart for that.
- <i>Laura, what I need you to do</i>

22:20.870 --> 22:23.270
<i>is absolutely nothing, OK?</i>

22:23.427 --> 22:27.028
Now, I can get a patrol car
to stay outside your house -

22:27.064 --> 22:29.744
Great, all my problems are solved (!)

22:30.755 --> 22:34.070
Look, will you pass on
what I've said at least?

22:34.110 --> 22:36.510
To your colleagues. Just...

22:36.550 --> 22:39.797
That woman he's with now, Charlotte,
I want her to be all right.

22:45.366 --> 22:47.223
Yeah, sure, I'll pass it on.

23:05.750 --> 23:08.150
- Hi, Detective.
- Vanessa.

23:08.322 --> 23:11.842
- Sorry to bother you.
- No bother. I'm catching up on paperwork.

23:12.894 --> 23:14.990
I just spoke with Laura Nielson.

23:15.030 --> 23:17.387
Laura, yeah, I met her yesterday.

23:18.167 --> 23:21.532
She thinks Andrew Earlham
records his attacks.

23:21.952 --> 23:23.624
That he's storing them somewhere.

23:23.991 --> 23:26.150
Earlham turned up outside
her house last night.

23:26.190 --> 23:28.310
He found out she's been
looking into him.

23:28.350 --> 23:29.612
I know.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.310
Because you told him? Why?

23:34.559 --> 23:37.350
We need Andrew unsettled. Angry.

23:37.633 --> 23:40.630
That's when he'll make mistakes,
that's when we'll catch him.

23:42.263 --> 23:44.463
Don't worry, we had a squad car
on Laura's place.

23:44.499 --> 23:46.310
You shouldn't put her
in the middle of this.

23:46.350 --> 23:48.070
She put herself in the middle.

23:48.110 --> 23:50.240
I just took the opportunity
to push Andrew.

23:50.276 --> 23:53.318
- I'm sorry, I know this isn't my place, but...
- Course it is.

23:53.430 --> 23:56.677
This operation is down to you.
I just wish we had more to report.

23:56.713 --> 23:59.501
- But tonight I'm going for dinner at his place.
- Tonight?

23:59.710 --> 24:01.492
Great Friday night, huh (?)

24:02.345 --> 24:05.505
- Don't make yourself too available.
- I've read the profile.

24:05.541 --> 24:06.593
I'm only saying...

24:06.629 --> 24:09.750
Look, I know how frustrating
it's been waiting for approval

24:09.790 --> 24:11.111
to come through, but we're close now.

24:11.428 --> 24:14.143
- Just keep the faith.
- OK.

24:15.870 --> 24:18.190
- Thanks, Detective.
- Of course.

24:52.280 --> 24:55.600
- Yep, just a minute.
- We need you.

24:55.640 --> 24:57.839
Can I grab something from my locker?

24:58.148 --> 25:00.821
There isn't much time. They've
been waiting a while already.

25:01.228 --> 25:03.279
All right, then, let's
get this over with.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.160
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:27.284 --> 25:28.631
I'm glad you called.

25:29.135 --> 25:31.029
It's been a long time.

25:31.671 --> 25:32.824
Yeah.

25:34.264 --> 25:35.921
Er, here.

25:36.425 --> 25:38.052
Andrew's phone.

25:39.480 --> 25:40.767
Thank you.

25:41.320 --> 25:44.051
I'd do anything for you, you know that.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.310
Even when you're angry at me.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.579
I don't suppose you're gonna
tell me what that's for?

25:52.360 --> 25:54.677
- It's probably best that you don't know.
- Don't know.

25:54.712 --> 25:55.905
OK.

25:58.080 --> 26:00.355
I thought you were moving on
with your life, Laura.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.908
- I have to do this.
- No, you don't.

26:04.676 --> 26:06.716
You never had to do any of it.

26:06.772 --> 26:09.932
You had a terrible thing happen
to you and you tried to fix it.

26:10.034 --> 26:14.034
Instead of taking time to get better
and look after yourself.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.234
I miss you.

26:22.696 --> 26:24.037
I miss you, too.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.760
Do you think you'll ever stop hating me?

26:31.580 --> 26:33.660
I don't hate you, Katy.

26:37.060 --> 26:38.815
I just... I can't trust you.

26:39.384 --> 26:41.383
And I don't know how to be around you.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.605
Well...

26:46.600 --> 26:48.050
when you are ready...

26:49.200 --> 26:50.840
..you know where I am.

27:55.114 --> 27:57.434
- Hi. Come in, come in.
- Hey.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.240
- Thanks.
- There you go. Thank you.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.480
Wow, you look amazing.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.320
- Just through here.
- Great.

28:15.520 --> 28:18.280
- That smells good.
- Thank you.

28:18.320 --> 28:21.840
It's nothing much, just er,
speciality-ordered ingredients

28:21.880 --> 28:25.000
and about 48 hours of preparation.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.520
- I'm glad you came.
- Why wouldn't I?

28:30.800 --> 28:33.243
Someone took my phone
from a locker today.

28:33.400 --> 28:36.800
- That's annoying.
- No, it's fine, it's been cancelled,

28:36.836 --> 28:38.390
and there's another one ordered.

28:38.426 --> 28:41.132
You know how it is, you lose your
phone, you feel like a child.

28:41.579 --> 28:43.819
How did we ever make social arrangements

28:43.855 --> 28:46.766
when we couldn't cancel or change
with a text last-minute?

28:47.360 --> 28:49.800
Well, I like to turn up
when I've agreed to.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.443
I'm old-fashioned like that.

28:51.986 --> 28:53.200
Me, too.

28:56.280 --> 28:57.567
Drink, m'lady?

28:57.856 --> 28:59.722
Yeah. Sounds good.

29:07.880 --> 29:11.354
- I like your place.
- Thanks. It's OK.

29:11.880 --> 29:15.320
Keep meaning to buy some more art
to put on the walls, you know?

29:15.360 --> 29:18.840
I found something last week,
actually. A local artist.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.840
It's on the wall in the other room,
if you fancy.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.623
Sure.

29:26.040 --> 29:29.120
Forgive me for asking. Er...

29:30.000 --> 29:31.354
Are you OK?

29:32.508 --> 29:34.668
- Of course. Why?
- Oh, I don't know.

29:35.320 --> 29:38.335
You just... You seem tense.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.032
Long day.

29:45.124 --> 29:46.994
Then I have just the thing for you.

30:24.480 --> 30:26.800
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

30:30.400 --> 30:34.615
Sorry, could I get a glass of water?
I'm a bit dehydrated today.

30:34.651 --> 30:36.480
I don't want to start off
on the wrong foot.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.887
Yes, yes, of course. I'll be right back.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.520
- There you go.
- Thanks.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.320
It's a nice piece.
What's the artist's name?

31:31.570 --> 31:33.391
What's in your bag, Charlotte?

31:34.640 --> 31:35.852
What do you mean?

31:36.421 --> 31:38.061
I saw you.

31:39.240 --> 31:42.115
You saw me what? I don't understand.

31:42.880 --> 31:45.240
You filled a syringe from your glass.

31:46.440 --> 31:47.823
And then...

31:49.120 --> 31:52.200
Hmm. You'll be making
your excuses, I imagine.

31:52.240 --> 31:55.200
An urgent phone call that meant
you just had to leave

31:55.240 --> 31:57.360
or a sudden headache and then...

31:57.400 --> 31:58.649
and then what?

31:59.003 --> 32:02.683
Take your precious sample
down to the police lab?

32:07.107 --> 32:08.751
Is that about the size of it?

32:10.465 --> 32:11.805
Charlotte?

32:13.080 --> 32:14.780
Step away.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.100
Why?

32:17.386 --> 32:19.911
What is it you think
I'm gonna do to you?

32:20.840 --> 32:23.319
I can have back-up here in seconds.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.802
Well, I'm not stopping you from leaving.

32:31.518 --> 32:33.891
Your lab's not gonna find anything.

32:34.936 --> 32:38.000
I poured you a glass of wine.
And that's it.

32:41.520 --> 32:42.793
It's a shame, really.

32:44.280 --> 32:45.788
We'd have had fun.

32:47.640 --> 32:48.972
I know it.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.200
Shit. Shit.

33:18.240 --> 33:19.440
Shit!

33:30.880 --> 33:33.120
So, how does this work?

33:33.160 --> 33:35.080
Honestly, no idea.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.427
A friend of mine from the tech squad
just gave me the programme.

33:40.974 --> 33:43.925
So, why did you take his phone, why now?

33:44.377 --> 33:46.560
I think that erm...

33:47.400 --> 33:49.960
when he rapes women he films it.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.540
- How do you know?
- Something he said.

33:53.840 --> 33:55.280
Sick bastard.

33:55.601 --> 33:58.160
I should've smashed his face in
when I had the chance.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.840
Wherever he keeps the files,
they're not in his house,

34:00.880 --> 34:02.800
they're not on his computer
or his phone,

34:02.840 --> 34:05.654
the police would have searched
after DI Harmon's charge.

34:05.787 --> 34:08.840
So if he keeps recordings,
they're offsite?

34:08.880 --> 34:11.141
Someone like him, he will be careful.

34:11.418 --> 34:12.938
There'll be a lot to get through.

34:12.974 --> 34:15.880
I could dump the contents
of the phone onto the laptop.

34:15.920 --> 34:20.280
I know it's helping me last time
that got you into this situation.

34:20.320 --> 34:23.080
Nah, Andrew was the one
who made sure I lost my job.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.440
Right. Well...

34:29.860 --> 34:32.260
OK. Thanks for calling.

34:37.322 --> 34:39.123
The op went badly.

34:39.159 --> 34:42.600
The undercover with Andrew Earlham.

34:42.639 --> 34:43.980
How bad?

34:48.760 --> 34:51.987
- Jesus.
- It's OK, we're gonna find another way.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.239
How?

34:53.275 --> 34:55.755
He walked away from the last accusation.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.360
And now you. How many more
until somebody stops him?

34:58.400 --> 35:00.880
We're doing our best. I mean, Rory...

35:00.920 --> 35:03.920
- the whole team, everybody.
- Well, it's not good enough.

35:03.960 --> 35:08.040
He attacked you in our house.
He needs to face the consequences.

35:08.080 --> 35:10.920
- Calm down, Jen.
- I can't. It's...

35:12.120 --> 35:14.040
I know this happened to you and not me,

35:14.080 --> 35:16.440
but I feel like
it's my job to protect you,

35:16.480 --> 35:19.320
- and I wasn't there.
- Please don't say that. You mustn't.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.550
Jen.

35:25.316 --> 35:28.876
Hey. Did Andrew ever mention
anybody called...

35:29.218 --> 35:32.298
- Mia Lentzovka?
- No. Why?

35:33.160 --> 35:35.520
Dunno. There's a text message
from a few days ago.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.080
So the cops wouldn't have seen it.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.680
"When can you come over
to collect your things?"

35:40.178 --> 35:42.018
Is there an address for this woman?

35:45.040 --> 35:48.072
- Yeah, it's in the contacts.
- Brilliant. Thank you.

35:48.840 --> 35:50.640
Right. I'm gonna call Vanessa.

35:50.680 --> 35:52.329
I hope it's useful.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.400
Thanks.

36:00.600 --> 36:02.171
I really am sorry.

36:03.320 --> 36:04.918
About me and Katy.

36:07.480 --> 36:10.382
I know. Me too.

36:11.507 --> 36:13.234
Thanks for helping me.

36:19.155 --> 36:20.707
<i>Hi, this is a Vanessa Harmon.</i>

36:20.743 --> 36:23.470
<i>I'm not around right now,
so leave a message.</i>

36:50.111 --> 36:51.387
Hello.

36:51.660 --> 36:53.300
Can I help you?

36:53.340 --> 36:55.266
Hi, I'm a...

36:55.871 --> 36:57.591
a friend of Andrew's.

36:57.695 --> 36:59.057
Andrew Earlham.

36:59.842 --> 37:02.260
- Is he all right?
- Fine. Yeah, yeah, fine.

37:02.300 --> 37:04.806
Erm, are you Mia?

37:05.390 --> 37:06.950
Yes. I am.

37:07.244 --> 37:08.814
I'm Laura.

37:09.596 --> 37:12.276
Actually, is it all right
if I come in for a minute?

37:16.420 --> 37:17.780
Thanks.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.110
Sylvia?

37:21.947 --> 37:24.775
This is a friend of Andrew's. Laura.

37:24.853 --> 37:27.462
- Hi.
- Hello, dear.

37:27.587 --> 37:29.700
How nice to have a visitor.

37:29.740 --> 37:32.508
Andrew never brings visitors here,
does he, Mia?

37:32.544 --> 37:33.816
No, never.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.827
Andrew asked me to pick
something up for him.

37:35.863 --> 37:37.660
He's got some stuff stored here?

37:38.087 --> 37:41.207
He was supposed to collect it
a few days ago.

37:45.828 --> 37:47.028
Yes.

37:47.064 --> 37:48.664
Yes, of course. Erm...

37:48.700 --> 37:50.340
Please, follow me.

37:50.376 --> 37:51.896
Thanks.

38:18.220 --> 38:19.510
Here you go.

38:20.049 --> 38:22.249
Thanks. I'll try and be quick.

38:52.244 --> 38:53.973
Hello. It's Mia.

39:40.980 --> 39:43.620
- Do you have everything? Did you find...
- Yes, thanks.

39:43.660 --> 39:46.260
I've got to run. Thank you.

41:33.340 --> 41:35.820
- She's pretty upset in there.
- OK.

41:45.060 --> 41:48.048
- Oh, God. Finally.
- I'm sorry.

41:48.144 --> 41:50.272
I wasn't on duty. I had to get in.

41:50.308 --> 41:52.860
I called Vanessa but her phone
goes straight to voicemail.

41:52.900 --> 41:55.980
You'd think people would move
quicker after what I found.

41:56.020 --> 41:58.540
The front desk told me
about the recordings.

41:58.580 --> 42:00.441
Yeah, it's erm...

42:03.467 --> 42:05.166
Yeah, erm...

42:09.156 --> 42:11.353
I could barely bring myself
to look, but...

42:12.967 --> 42:16.660
But I'm in there, and... Vanessa and...

42:17.633 --> 42:20.580
I counted at least 15 others.

42:21.691 --> 42:23.771
15 women just like me.

42:23.807 --> 42:25.073
17.

42:25.701 --> 42:28.901
The tech guys tell me 17.

42:29.762 --> 42:33.020
And Andrew Earlham
is clearly identifiable.

42:33.060 --> 42:37.380
He's going away, Miss Nielson,
for a really, really long time.

42:47.380 --> 42:49.100
I've heard that before.

42:49.136 --> 42:52.674
They let you into the house.
They let you search the shed.

42:52.710 --> 42:56.548
Everything you found
is going into evidence.

42:57.260 --> 42:58.580
I promise you.

42:58.620 --> 43:00.290
It's over now.

43:01.780 --> 43:03.074
It's over.

43:03.831 --> 43:05.724
We're picking him up right now.

43:44.740 --> 43:46.461
We're looking for Andrew Earlham.

43:47.780 --> 43:50.798
- What do you want with my dad?
- We have a warrant for his arrest.

43:51.260 --> 43:52.960
He's not here.

44:09.060 --> 44:13.060
<i>And, finally,
despite three weeks of searching,</i>

44:13.100 --> 44:16.140
<i>the police are no closer
to finding Andrew Earlham,</i>

44:16.477 --> 44:19.957
<i>who is wanted in connection
with a number of rape allegations.</i>

44:20.574 --> 44:24.661
<i>Mr Earlham, a cardiothoracic
surgeon at Broadhill Hospital,</i>

44:24.697 --> 44:29.380
<i>has been the subject of two separate
investigations in recent months,</i>

44:29.420 --> 44:32.460
<i>but neither case led to prosecution.</i>

44:34.660 --> 44:38.425
<i>Several weeks ago, a warrant
was issued for Mr Earlham's arrest</i>

44:38.461 --> 44:41.300
<i>and, shortly after, recordings
of his alleged sexual assaults</i>

44:41.340 --> 44:44.394
<i>dating back years,
were leaked to the press.</i>

44:47.359 --> 44:50.620
<i>Police ask that anyone with
information on Mr Earlham</i>

44:50.660 --> 44:52.940
<i>or his whereabouts come forward.</i>
