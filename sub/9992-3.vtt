00:02.202 --> 00:03.701
Tim, listen to me.

00:03.998 --> 00:07.137
A certain amount of selfishness is good.

00:07.259 --> 00:10.183
A marriage without selfishness is a marriage without pleasure.

00:10.403 --> 00:12.646
And a marriage without pleasure is doomed.

00:13.347 --> 00:16.071
Yes, we love. Yes, we give.

00:16.532 --> 00:18.611
Yes, we want to make our partner happy.

00:19.189 --> 00:23.352
But it's like that announcement they make on the airplane.

00:24.112 --> 00:26.777
If the cabin should suddenly lose pressure,

00:27.304 --> 00:30.228
first you must attend to your own oxygen mask,

00:30.760 --> 00:32.394
then put on your child's,

00:32.902 --> 00:33.931
your partner's.

00:35.480 --> 00:36.564
Do you follow me?

00:38.723 --> 00:39.859
Okay, then.

00:40.699 --> 00:42.255
The rest is simple.

00:44.769 --> 00:46.868
You want to do something with Donna.

00:47.298 --> 00:48.220
To Donna.

00:48.860 --> 00:52.700
You've wanted to do it for a long time, but you thought it was wrong.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.694
You thought Donna wouldn't understand.

00:55.859 --> 00:58.748
You thought society wouldn't understand.

00:59.468 --> 01:01.168
Well, today you're going to do it.

01:02.362 --> 01:04.553
Right here. Right now.

01:06.825 --> 01:07.670
Okay.

01:08.315 --> 01:09.309
Stand up.

01:12.679 --> 01:13.452
Tim.

01:14.741 --> 01:18.166
Nothing can happen unless you stand up and face your wife.

01:19.007 --> 01:19.881
Now come on.

01:21.906 --> 01:23.128
Are you embarrassed?

01:23.814 --> 01:25.965
Are you embarrassed to do it in front of me?

01:26.564 --> 01:27.962
Don't be embarrassed.

01:28.525 --> 01:29.717
I've seen it all.

01:31.367 --> 01:32.287
Now come on.

01:33.599 --> 01:36.256
Stand up and face your wife.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074

02:19.014 --> 02:20.462
Excellent, Tim.

02:21.420 --> 02:22.981
Excellent job.

02:26.847 --> 02:27.835
What's going on?

02:30.227 --> 02:33.258
We fell asleep watching the news. It's almost 2:00 in the morning.

02:33.355 --> 02:33.949
Yep.

02:34.732 --> 02:36.467
Oh, I just had the weirdest dream.

02:36.576 --> 02:39.878
Of course you did. It's a day that ends in "Y".

03:48.839 --> 03:49.628
Joe?

03:53.512 --> 03:54.329
Girls?

04:03.939 --> 04:06.090
But I feel funny not telling Mommy.

04:06.462 --> 04:09.637
- But if you tell Mommy, it won't be a surprise.
- Right.

04:11.705 --> 04:13.733
Hello, my sneaky family.

04:15.770 --> 04:19.349
You don't give a dentist candy, you don't buy a kitten for a veterinarian,

04:19.410 --> 04:22.299
and you don't plan a surprise party for someone like me.

04:22.755 --> 04:25.483
Who said anyone was planning a surprise party for you?

04:26.913 --> 04:28.679
All right, fine. You tell the kids.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.412
They're the ones who wanted to have the early morning meeting.

04:31.551 --> 04:34.014
They're the ones that are really fired up about your birthday.

04:34.136 --> 04:37.029
Really? So it was their idea, not yours?

04:37.148 --> 04:39.579
Hey, do I look like a fool to you?

04:41.827 --> 04:44.428
You are a deeply disturbed man.

04:44.715 --> 04:45.603
Thank you, darling.

04:46.635 --> 04:51.023
Now, listen, as long as you know about everything, there's a list of things they say they need for the party.

04:51.095 --> 04:52.758
I can't get them until Saturday.

04:53.563 --> 04:57.058
You want me to buy supplies for my own surprise party?

04:57.166 --> 04:59.163
Well, it's not like it's going to ruin it for you.

04:59.471 --> 05:03.913
Well, okay, fine. You're the one that's going to be disappointed when all the good piÃ±atas are gone.

05:04.694 --> 05:07.575
- So what do you make of that dream?
- Some guy kills his wife?

05:08.010 --> 05:09.920
I don't mean to make you nervous, but

05:11.390 --> 05:14.287
- that happens every day.
- At the marriage counselor?

05:14.533 --> 05:17.135
- Every other day.
- With the therapist urging him on?

05:17.242 --> 05:20.314
- I take your point.
- I know it's not a realistic dream.

05:20.392 --> 05:22.843
If that had really happened, it would have made the headlines.

05:23.597 --> 05:26.356
I just can't figure out whether or not to mention it at work.

05:26.449 --> 05:28.528
What do you mean? To the D.A.? Why would you do that?

05:28.751 --> 05:31.035
I don't know, I must have dreamt it for a reason.

05:31.158 --> 05:34.430
Yeah, and the reason is, the TV was on, and subconsciously you were listening to

05:34.512 --> 05:38.202
a bunch of lunatics who are married talk about how they want to kill each other.

05:38.312 --> 05:39.295
That's true.

05:39.893 --> 05:42.740
Which is why the next time we fall asleep with the television on,

05:43.292 --> 05:46.232
I'm going to make sure we got a little soft-core something going on.

05:46.748 --> 05:48.264
You get my meaning, woman?

05:52.176 --> 05:54.495
- Go to work.
- Oh, yeah. She heard me.

05:55.174 --> 05:58.490
Call Maury Povich. Tell him I'm ready for my close-up.

06:08.229 --> 06:09.441
Detective Scanlon.

06:09.865 --> 06:12.288
Scanlon? This is Dispatch. What's your 20?

06:12.903 --> 06:14.905
I'm at a crime scene in Scottsdale.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.741
Scottsdale? That's not in your jurisdiction.

06:18.366 --> 06:21.658
I'm having a difficult time copying you. Why don't you call me back in 15 minutes?

06:29.020 --> 06:31.242
- Detective Scanlon.
- Detective Scanlon?

06:31.325 --> 06:35.374
I guess we were disconnected. The Lieutenant was looking for you. May I connect?

06:35.461 --> 06:36.869
Absolutely. Put him through.

06:54.106 --> 06:55.009
Manny.

06:55.772 --> 06:56.669
Thanks for coming.

06:57.324 --> 06:58.035
You're the best.

06:58.609 --> 07:02.291
Yeah, well, I'm starting to think that I'm the most naive.

07:03.212 --> 07:05.767
Every  one of these men wants to know what I'm doing here.

07:05.988 --> 07:07.998
Every one of these men wants to know what you're doing here.

07:08.076 --> 07:09.673
Tell 'em to take a 'lude. It's a crime scene.

07:09.761 --> 07:13.831
Lee, I'm not going to tell anyone to take anything. And as a matter of fact, no, it's not.

07:13.897 --> 07:16.581
It's not a crime scene. Not the way you mean.

07:16.969 --> 07:18.403
This is a murder-suicide.

07:19.002 --> 07:22.346
This man killed his wife, then he killed himself, and that's how the Coroner's going to find

07:22.439 --> 07:24.388
and that's how the City's going to record it.

07:24.482 --> 07:26.994
There's no need for a prosecutor, there's no need for a detective.

07:27.112 --> 07:31.945
Particularly one who's outside his jurisdiction and is on the verge of being suspended.

07:34.505 --> 07:35.884
Manny, you ever seen this?

07:37.042 --> 07:37.680
What?

07:37.967 --> 07:39.134
Bowling for Columbine.

07:39.492 --> 07:40.312
I think so.

07:40.404 --> 07:43.399
Belongs to them. They owned it. It's like the Gone With the Wind of gun control movies.

07:43.491 --> 07:45.667
- Yeah? So?
- So you're telling me a young, married couple

07:45.749 --> 07:48.826
whose idea of a hot Friday night is watching an anti- NRA documentary

07:48.888 --> 07:52.406
keep an unregistered, loaded .32 in their apartment-- I don't think so.

07:53.243 --> 07:54.746
Someone did this.

07:55.078 --> 07:57.848
This is like the other ones, Manny. They're connected.

07:58.058 --> 07:58.754
Yeah.

08:00.638 --> 08:02.804
But why are you the only one who sees it?

08:04.289 --> 08:07.539
You know, I've never really shared with anyone who you are or what you do.

08:08.165 --> 08:08.963
Okay.

08:09.449 --> 08:11.565
But I have a friend, he's a police detective.

08:11.780 --> 08:14.226
He called me this morning, wants me to go to the mayor,

08:14.550 --> 08:18.016
- get funding for a special task force.
- What kind of task force?

08:18.513 --> 08:22.670
For the past two years or so he's been obsessed with a string of deaths here in Phoenix.

08:22.757 --> 08:25.056
- And?
- And it's destroying his career.

08:25.527 --> 08:30.089
He's ignoring all his other work. I don't think his personal life is anything to write home about either.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.922
I don't understand...

08:33.801 --> 08:37.339
He sees a crime where others just see personal turmoil.

08:37.989 --> 08:41.664
He  sees a pattern where others see only random tragedy.

08:41.768 --> 08:43.496
He'll tell you all about it.

08:44.071 --> 08:45.976
He's waiting for you up at the crime scene.

08:47.779 --> 08:52.812
I've asked them to leave the bodies and everything else they found exactly the way they found it.

08:53.022 --> 08:55.920
I was pretty vague with him. I told him that you were someone who worked for me,

08:56.012 --> 08:57.251
someone I trust.

08:57.691 --> 09:00.619
Listen to what he has to say. Look at the things he wants to show you.

09:00.686 --> 09:01.654
Tell me what you think.

09:01.884 --> 09:03.635
- Okay.
- Thanks.

09:10.323 --> 09:12.114
- Hello?
- Up here.

09:14.234 --> 09:16.360
Put some booties and gloves on first, though.

09:35.528 --> 09:39.116
District Attorney Devalos asked me to stop by. Are you his friend?

09:39.235 --> 09:40.382
Guilty as charged.

09:42.968 --> 09:45.548
- Detective Scanlon.
- Allison. Allison Dubois.

09:45.630 --> 09:47.141
So what do we have here?

09:48.513 --> 09:50.777
Young married couple found shot to death.

09:50.954 --> 09:52.782
Guy was 29. Girl 27.

09:54.038 --> 09:57.457
Coroner thinks the husband put a bullet in his wife's head, then turned the gun on himself.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.040
So what do you think happened?

09:59.301 --> 10:00.054
I don't know.

10:01.031 --> 10:01.973
Not that.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.463
"Not that"? That's your basis for a task force?

10:06.577 --> 10:07.524
"Not that"?

10:08.942 --> 10:11.291
Look, I don't know what it is exactly you do with the D.A.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.584
I don't know what your specialty is. Forensics? Linguistics? Criminology?

10:14.863 --> 10:18.919
Maybe you were with the FBI or the CSI or the CIA or the kiss my ass.

10:19.673 --> 10:23.694
Don't misunderstand me. I don't mean any disrespect, but me, I'm just a cop.

10:23.883 --> 10:24.979
Not a specialist.

10:25.316 --> 10:27.840
Started in Traffic control. Glorified crossing guard.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.691
And I'm here to tell you that I could look into a windshield 30 feet away

10:31.772 --> 10:34.312
and tell you if the driver was going to see the stop sign I was holding up

10:34.373 --> 10:37.552
or if he was going to run the intersection. And I was always right.

10:39.198 --> 10:40.021
Instinct.

10:41.121 --> 10:43.871
It got me this far, so I listen to it.

10:45.467 --> 10:46.938
Is there anything else?

10:47.214 --> 10:48.003
Yeah.

10:49.545 --> 10:53.184
In the past 27 months, there have been three cases in the Greater Phoenix area

10:53.261 --> 10:56.584
of supposed murder-suicides among couples married little more than a year.

10:56.646 --> 10:58.667
Well, they do say the first year's the hardest.

10:59.010 --> 11:00.112
I wouldn't know.

11:01.510 --> 11:04.698
But what I do know is, in the 90-some years prior to that,

11:04.760 --> 11:08.897
in fact for as long as they kept records, there wasn't one other case thought

11:08.953 --> 11:13.469
to be murder-suicide among couples married more than one year but less than two.

11:14.284 --> 11:16.956
- Not one.
- Well, these are complicated times.

11:17.279 --> 11:20.211
Phoenix is a bigger than it's ever been before. People get married,

11:20.313 --> 11:23.194
there are bound to be disappointments, temptations...

11:25.559 --> 11:26.997
The first couple...

11:28.534 --> 11:30.310
was my sister and her husband.

11:33.136 --> 11:34.181
I'm sorry.

11:35.174 --> 11:37.259
He would've killed for her. She would've killed for him.

11:37.314 --> 11:39.931
There's nothing complicated about it. They didn't do it to each other.

11:40.954 --> 11:42.317
Someone did it to them.

11:43.294 --> 11:44.319
Same thing here.

11:46.234 --> 11:50.611
So, how do you want to do this? Do you want to wait outside, or should I call you or...?

11:50.693 --> 11:51.569
What do you mean?

11:51.666 --> 11:54.062
I need to be alone, so I can concentrate.

11:57.115 --> 11:58.184
All right.

12:00.923 --> 12:01.696
All right.

12:32.156 --> 12:33.533
Nice to see you again.

12:38.637 --> 12:41.172
They did a wonderful job, don't you think?

12:43.409 --> 12:45.416
Really rose to the occasion.

12:47.669 --> 12:49.810
Actually, I don't know what to think.

12:50.285 --> 12:51.360
Who are you?

12:52.212 --> 12:53.470
Are you dead, too?

12:53.873 --> 12:55.881
Me? No.

12:56.372 --> 12:58.401
I'm... no one.

12:59.164 --> 13:01.037
I'm not even a real person.

13:01.451 --> 13:04.611
I'm just energy left behind by the two of them.

13:05.211 --> 13:07.607
A way for them to communicate with you.

13:08.328 --> 13:10.065
Through your dreams last night.

13:10.596 --> 13:11.692
Here, now.

13:13.141 --> 13:17.262
They'd speak to you themselves, but their souls are still in shock.

13:17.837 --> 13:19.280
Both their souls.

13:19.972 --> 13:25.127
You see, this happened not because one was angry with the other.

13:26.166 --> 13:31.681
This happened because each loved the other more than life itself.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.664
It's  important to them you understand this.

14:36.335 --> 14:37.392
A third person?

14:37.841 --> 14:40.663
- And you're certain of this?
- Can I tell you who it is? No.

14:40.802 --> 14:43.285
Can I tell you what they were doing there? Uh-uh.

14:43.434 --> 14:45.799
Can I tell you why all this happened? No. Not yet.

14:45.992 --> 14:50.909
But I do agree with Detective Scanlon. This is not something that these two people did to each other.

14:51.036 --> 14:52.968
This is something that was done to them.

14:53.381 --> 14:55.787
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!

14:59.710 --> 15:01.727
Thank  you, thank you, thank you.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.776
So what'd you pick up? A third set of fingerprints?

15:09.299 --> 15:10.538
A hair sample?

15:13.319 --> 15:15.178
Maybe there was something about the wounds?

15:15.890 --> 15:16.724
Lee...

15:19.427 --> 15:24.250
Allison specializes in a more... unconventional branch of criminology.

15:26.600 --> 15:30.210
Okay. So what is it convinced you? Some kind of evidence, right?

15:30.291 --> 15:32.356
Something Manny here can take into a court of law?

15:33.052 --> 15:36.661
Something he can use to... persuade the mayor to fund a task force,

15:36.738 --> 15:39.150
get some manpower and some resources on this case?

15:47.402 --> 15:49.185
I had a dream the other night.

15:55.574 --> 15:59.978
Oh, crap. Shoot me now. She's not a criminologist at all, is she?

16:00.172 --> 16:03.593
Allison is an extraordinarily sensitive and intuitive person who I've worked with

16:03.663 --> 16:08.677
- to great effect on a number of cases.
- Do I have the word "jackass" stenciled across my forehead?!

16:08.757 --> 16:10.453
- All right, you need to lower you voice.
- Oh, my God!

16:10.535 --> 16:12.326
- Did you hear what I said?
- What do I look like to you, Manny?

16:12.403 --> 16:15.541
She's one of those sob-sister fortunetellers that crawls out from under a rock

16:15.600 --> 16:17.637
when you can't find the missing kid and it's been over a year

16:17.698 --> 16:21.204
and the parents are getting desperate and they'll listen to just about anyone, isn't she?

16:21.320 --> 16:24.990
Point in fact, up until recently, Mrs. Dubois was a very accomplished law student...

16:25.051 --> 16:27.350
What were you thinking? How the hell is she going to get me a task force?!

16:27.432 --> 16:29.862
What are you going to do? Walk up to the mayor and tell him she had a dream?

16:30.539 --> 16:31.799
No, seriously. Answer me that.

16:31.885 --> 16:36.888
How is putting me together with Milli Vanilli the Psychic here gonna get me a task force?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.301
You're right. That was never gonna happen.

16:39.714 --> 16:43.114
Would you mind telling me just what was the point?

16:43.196 --> 16:46.974
The point-- assuming she agreed with you that there was something worth investigating--

16:47.035 --> 16:50.133
was that Mrs. Dubois is your task force. That's it.

16:50.241 --> 16:52.638
She's all the resources anyone is ever gonna give you, period.

16:52.719 --> 16:55.229
Oh, boy, you really know how to make a girl feel special.

16:56.453 --> 16:57.997
You're insane.

16:59.540 --> 17:00.722
And you're insaner.

17:01.117 --> 17:06.733
And you do have the word "ass" tattooed on your forehead except it doesn't have a "jack" in front of it!

17:07.122 --> 17:09.561
Don't you want to know about the other three cases?

17:09.692 --> 17:12.523
Seeing as how I seem to be the only person on the planet

17:12.647 --> 17:14.843
who agrees with you even a little bit?

17:15.171 --> 17:17.633
Wouldn't you want to know if I see any similarities?

17:17.932 --> 17:19.722
I don't know what's she talking about, Manny.

17:19.917 --> 17:21.949
I don't have three other crime scenes to take her to.

17:22.048 --> 17:24.055
Give her a set of the crime scene photos.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.616
Will that do it?

17:25.759 --> 17:27.115
Well, it's a start.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.812
- She's here! 
- Daddy, she's here! I'll watch the baby.

17:49.204 --> 17:51.180
You just aged me by ten years.

17:51.277 --> 17:53.248
And that would make you a whopping 38.

17:53.807 --> 17:56.750
Very nice. Good recovery. I think I'll keep ya.

17:56.848 --> 17:59.854
So, listen, so when you walk through that door, the kids are going to be all over you.

17:59.925 --> 18:01.676
I told them I needed them to distract you

18:01.758 --> 18:04.912
so I could sneak all the party stuff out of my car and into the house.

18:05.010 --> 18:06.725
- Out of your car.
- Yeah.

18:06.827 --> 18:11.706
Of course, because you bought it because you are superdaddy

18:11.915 --> 18:15.245
and a superhusband trying to pull off a supersurpise party for...

18:15.312 --> 18:17.035
For my 28-year-old wife.

18:19.571 --> 18:21.670
You're really pushing your luck.

18:33.978 --> 18:37.588
Wow, the things you won't do to try and spice up our love life.

18:38.387 --> 18:40.773
I don't know about you, but this does nothing for me.

18:40.896 --> 18:43.047
It's not funny. These people are really dead.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.856
Boy,  as you get older, approaching your 30s and everything,

18:46.932 --> 18:48.283
you're really starting to lose your sense of humor.

18:48.387 --> 18:51.698
You know, you've gotten every bit of mileage you can out of that joke.

18:52.555 --> 18:53.670
Someone's in a good mood.

18:53.774 --> 18:57.039
The more I look at these pictures, the less sense everything makes.

19:00.066 --> 19:02.830
So, why don't you tell Devalos to take you off whatever this is?

19:02.907 --> 19:04.278
Tell him you're not getting anything.

19:04.781 --> 19:06.435
Well, that's just it. I am.

19:06.773 --> 19:08.626
It's just what I'm getting doesn't add up.

19:08.944 --> 19:12.538
And it's not just Devalos. There's this cop. This detective.

19:13.106 --> 19:15.840
You should have heard him talking about his instincts.

19:16.378 --> 19:20.617
Suddenly when it became about my instincts, about him working with me?

19:20.714 --> 19:22.554
Well, that would be insane.

19:22.855 --> 19:26.230
- I must be insane.
- Well, then, this is perfect, isn't it?

19:26.362 --> 19:28.641
You don't like him. Sounds like he doesn't like you.

19:28.841 --> 19:31.743
The things you're sensing about this case aren't clarifying anything.

19:31.820 --> 19:35.389
All great reasons to respectfully remove yourself.

19:38.801 --> 19:43.802
Hmm. Well, I might just do that. I might just do that.

19:43.868 --> 19:46.039
Good. I'm glad I could be of help.

20:13.678 --> 20:16.801
- That makes no sense.
- I'm just telling you what I saw.

20:16.898 --> 20:19.975
- What you dreamt.
- What I saw in my dreams.

20:20.129 --> 20:21.547
Help me out here, will you, Manny?

20:21.653 --> 20:26.277
All right, let me see if I can understand this. You would see their faces...

20:26.365 --> 20:28.668
They came to me in flashes, like crime scene photos.

20:28.767 --> 20:31.474
- Right. But always the husband first.
- Yes.

20:31.613 --> 20:33.451
And always having already been shot.

20:33.554 --> 20:36.112
And that makes you think that the husbands died first?

20:36.538 --> 20:40.531
Allison, the husband was always found at the crime scene with the gun in his hand

20:40.599 --> 20:42.385
covered with blowback and powder residue.

20:42.519 --> 20:45.795
You can't kill yourself first and then kill your wife.

20:45.912 --> 20:46.666
Thank you.

20:46.795 --> 20:49.507
Excuse me. Could you remind the detective that I am on his side?

20:49.609 --> 20:50.938
It's all right. Tell her I appreciate the help.

20:50.987 --> 20:53.215
But I would really prefer it if her theories made a little more sense.

20:53.285 --> 20:55.420
- Excuse me?
- But with all due respect, ma'am,

20:55.487 --> 20:58.965
all you do is come up with things that contradict the physical evidence.

20:59.047 --> 21:02.030
- That kind of help I don't need.
- At least I have a theory. What's yours?

21:02.108 --> 21:04.561
You've been on this two years and what have you come up with?

21:04.657 --> 21:07.439
"My sister's husband wouldn't do that." Frankly, I'm not impressed.

21:07.539 --> 21:09.086
- Allison...
- Golly, ma'am. Not impressing you?

21:09.169 --> 21:11.682
I can't tell you how upsetting that is. I'll probably be awake all night.

21:11.784 --> 21:13.843
Lee, would you give it a rest, please?

21:17.529 --> 21:19.530
I told you not now!

21:24.303 --> 21:28.886
Well, I guess this was a bad idea. You two are clearly not meant to work with each other.

21:29.699 --> 21:31.650
Allison, I appreciate your time and effort,

21:31.773 --> 21:35.957
and I apologize for my friend's extraordinary lack of gratitude.

21:36.935 --> 21:40.795
Lee, I hope I can count on you not to say anything to anyone about who Allison is

21:40.866 --> 21:43.149
and how we use her talents here in the D.A.'s office.

21:43.243 --> 21:44.482
You're kidding, right?

21:45.178 --> 21:48.935
Is there anything else you would like to share before I put this investigation to bed once and for all?

21:49.018 --> 21:50.942
- No.
- We're done.

21:51.239 --> 21:52.899
Yes, there's one thing.

21:53.846 --> 21:56.614
Like I suspected, when I looked at the crime photos,

21:56.805 --> 21:59.857
I always saw three people at every one of the killings.

22:00.512 --> 22:01.951
Except for...

22:04.387 --> 22:05.223
this one.

22:08.310 --> 22:09.800
This one had four people.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.749
Oh, four now? Well, the killer bring a friend with him?

22:12.825 --> 22:14.080
Damn it, Lee!

22:15.048 --> 22:19.206
Hey, Task Force, you got any idea what any of these people actually might look like?

22:19.268 --> 22:21.950
I mean, that would give us a real leg up. Are they male? Are they female?

22:22.068 --> 22:25.258
It doesn't work like that. I don't see them. I feel them.

22:25.340 --> 22:28.018
Oh, well, okay, so does it feel like an Anglo guy

22:28.100 --> 22:31.627
or a Latin guy? Is he black? Or maybe he's got kind of an Asian feel?

22:31.944 --> 22:34.142
Wow, she's right. You are an ass.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.567
Thanks for that vote of confidence.

22:36.675 --> 22:40.106
Yeah, and as far as this not being what it appears to be? Well, there's an old expression:

22:40.168 --> 22:43.174
If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then it is a duck.

22:43.501 --> 22:46.634
Personally, I think you're up to your knees in a duck pond, Detective.

22:46.998 --> 22:50.147
Pardon me, um, Mr. District Attorney, The Third Precinct keeps calling,

22:50.203 --> 22:53.107
and they were wondering if you could run down there. Apparently, they have some kind of situation.

22:53.192 --> 22:54.733
All right. Tell them I'm on my way.

22:58.317 --> 23:00.110
Allison, Detective Scanlon.

23:05.814 --> 23:06.894
Idiot.

23:07.437 --> 23:10.406
Sorry to make you come across town, but the chief wanted to cut you in early.

23:10.621 --> 23:11.718
Cut me in early on what?

23:11.815 --> 23:14.732
Our guys were called to a homicide last night and they brought this guy in,

23:15.189 --> 23:18.525
but nobody can quite get a fix on whether he's the victim or perpetrator.

23:18.603 --> 23:22.188
And  he's like, "I'm doing an experiment. A social experiment."

23:22.270 --> 23:25.573
And he's standing there in my house; ski mask, you know?

23:25.670 --> 23:28.803
He's about my height, I think. I don't know. And he's pointing a gun at me and my wife.

23:28.869 --> 23:31.496
And I'm like... "experiment"? What kind of experiment?" And I'm talking, you know?

23:31.537 --> 23:35.254
'Cause I'm thinking. Talking is good. Talking is better than dying, you know?

23:35.316 --> 23:38.920
And he's like, "You love her?" He's pointing at my wife. I'm like, "Of course I love her. She's my wife!"

23:38.966 --> 23:43.205
He goes, "Okay, here's the deal. You shoot her and we'll let you live."

23:43.267 --> 23:46.294
And I'm like, "What?! Are you... are you insane?"

23:46.364 --> 23:50.097
He's like, "No, I'm a social scientist, you bourgeois A-hole!"

23:50.169 --> 23:52.765
And he takes his gun and he puts it right under my chin, right here, and he goes,

23:52.826 --> 23:57.429
"Okay, lab rat, "you shoot her or I'll shoot you both.

23:57.505 --> 23:59.784
Make a choice. You wanna live? You wanna live?"

23:59.856 --> 24:02.626
And I'm like, "Yeah, of course! Of course! And he goes, "Okay, so do it.

24:02.723 --> 24:04.735
Choose life! Shoot her!"

24:04.834 --> 24:07.141
And she's wailing, you know? She's screaming,

24:07.256 --> 24:09.092
and you can't even make out what she's saying, even.

24:09.164 --> 24:12.175
And for a second, like, I almost thought she was saying, "Do it.

24:12.236 --> 24:14.739
And I'm thinking, "Do it? Shoot my wife?"

24:14.809 --> 24:16.860
I can't! I can't do that.

24:16.937 --> 24:18.401
I can't do that!

24:18.498 --> 24:20.767
And then, and then the gun was...

24:21.140 --> 24:23.879
the gun was so light... the gun was so...

24:23.961 --> 24:28.672
And then I'm thinking, "Oh, I see, I get it. It's a joke. It's a freakin' joke," you know?

24:28.758 --> 24:31.584
And he's got his gun right here and she's wailing, so I did it.

24:31.688 --> 24:32.803
I pulled the trigger.

24:35.665 --> 24:41.242
Mr. Conrad, so am I to understand that you're now admitting to what happened?

24:41.600 --> 24:44.211
Admitting that you did kill your wife?

24:44.277 --> 24:46.080
No. No.

24:46.424 --> 24:50.085
It's like I said before. I did pull the trigger, but nothing happened.

24:50.160 --> 24:53.622
It went "chik". Nothing. It's an empty gun.

24:54.231 --> 24:56.002
And that guy laughed.

24:57.042 --> 25:01.146
And he goes, "You're the first one to ever do it.

25:02.946 --> 25:05.398
"You're the first one I've ever met.

25:05.633 --> 25:06.966
Congratulations."

25:07.779 --> 25:09.981
And then he just stood behind me,

25:10.339 --> 25:14.226
holding me and sudden I felt his gun leave my chin and...

25:16.159 --> 25:17.281
He shot her.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.483
And I could feel... I could feel her...

25:26.902 --> 25:28.853
her blood, I guess.

25:30.164 --> 25:32.687
Skin and stuff hit me in the face...

25:33.804 --> 25:35.018
in the chest.

25:37.353 --> 25:39.538
And then he just...

25:40.986 --> 25:43.332
handed me the gun, the real gun...

25:44.858 --> 25:45.975
and he left.

25:54.679 --> 25:56.034
So what do you make of that?

25:57.939 --> 25:59.548
Yeah, track down Lee Scanlon.

25:59.634 --> 26:01.852
Ask him to come down to the Third Precinct right away.

26:02.216 --> 26:04.050
Ask Allison to come along, too.

26:04.611 --> 26:05.288
Okay.

26:07.986 --> 26:12.703
And do you have any idea how this mysterious man in a ski mask gained entry to your home, Mr. Conrad?

26:12.808 --> 26:15.451
No. I have no idea.

26:15.752 --> 26:18.523
I came home from work, I walked in the door,

26:18.635 --> 26:23.581
and there he was, a gun to my wife's head, talking about how he's this social scientist guy

26:23.632 --> 26:26.976
and how we've been specially chosen to be part of his experiment.

26:27.064 --> 26:28.619
So let me ask you this question.

26:28.732 --> 26:32.034
Why do you think a killer would go through all the trouble

26:32.122 --> 26:34.502
to find a way to discreetly enter your home,

26:34.870 --> 26:36.509
confront you and your wife,

26:37.328 --> 26:40.226
kill your wife in cold blood right in front of you

26:40.503 --> 26:41.999
and then let you live?

26:43.370 --> 26:46.437
Don't you think he'd worry that you'd do the very thing you're doing now?

26:46.519 --> 26:49.468
Describe what happened, describe him to the police?

26:49.663 --> 26:50.574
Why would he do that?

26:52.721 --> 26:56.289
I... I don't know.

26:58.459 --> 27:01.239
- You think I did it, don't you?
- I didn't say that, sir.

27:01.331 --> 27:04.239
Well, you don't have to be a mind reader to figure it out!

27:05.188 --> 27:06.892
I guess because I did it.

27:07.050 --> 27:09.878
He told me he'd let me live if I did it, and then I did it.

27:10.665 --> 27:12.012
I mean not really, but...

27:12.765 --> 27:14.325
I showed him that I could...

27:16.185 --> 27:17.459
that I would.

27:18.068 --> 27:21.598
I mean, think about it. I know it sounds crazy. I mean, it is crazy!

27:21.679 --> 27:23.501
But maybe it's not that crazy.

27:23.925 --> 27:28.570
I mean, here I am, telling you about what happened, and you're thinking I'm crazy or I'm lying.

27:28.632 --> 27:31.039
Which is what he wants you to think, right?

27:32.988 --> 27:36.189
So, actually if you think about it, it's not that crazy.

27:36.307 --> 27:38.119
In fact, that's pretty smart.

27:39.890 --> 27:40.831
Right?

27:48.528 --> 27:50.177
He's heading over to the crime scene.

27:50.699 --> 27:52.905
He asked me to ask you if you'd like to go along.

27:54.374 --> 27:56.381
So I hear you wanted some company.

27:59.347 --> 28:01.113
Did someone have a change of heart?

28:02.296 --> 28:03.673
Nah. Same old heart.

28:04.892 --> 28:07.072
Remember yesterday when you said you thought there were four people there

28:07.145 --> 28:09.326
when my sister and her husband...

28:10.918 --> 28:12.587
Didn't make sense to me at first...

28:13.611 --> 28:14.717
then I remembered.

28:15.674 --> 28:18.290
My sister was three-and-a-half months pregnant when she died.

28:21.809 --> 28:24.082
Hey, Joe, this is Bill.

28:24.439 --> 28:26.309
Gosh, I hope I'm calling the right number.

28:26.417 --> 28:30.963
Uh, listen, Jenny and I would love to come to the surprise party.

28:31.152 --> 28:34.275
We both remember meeting Allison at the company Christmas party

28:34.362 --> 28:38.807
and we've been meaning to call and get together ever since, so this is, uh, this is perfect.

28:39.049 --> 28:42.350
Anyway, count us in. Uh... Friday night.

28:42.438 --> 28:45.386
Your house. 8:00. See ya.

28:46.641 --> 28:49.396
That was great. It's incredible.

28:49.528 --> 28:52.344
Thanks. And, uh, I can count on you?

28:53.741 --> 28:55.498
Two tickets. "Our Town".

28:55.739 --> 28:58.176
At the Church. Starring you.

28:58.888 --> 28:59.778
Break a leg.

29:09.548 --> 29:10.516
How does this work?

29:12.907 --> 29:16.813
I don't know. Whoever made me this way forgot to give me an instruction book.

29:20.155 --> 29:21.400
I like those.

30:05.287 --> 30:06.702
Could you stop doing that?

30:09.288 --> 30:10.343
Stop what?

30:16.886 --> 30:18.407
I think I need some fresh air.

30:34.791 --> 30:35.800
You feeling any better?

30:38.273 --> 30:40.137
You seen many dead people in your life?

30:43.275 --> 30:46.132
The reason I ask is, I've actually seen quite a few.

30:51.754 --> 30:55.942
It's funny you come to a crime scene, you see them laying there, the first place you look is their eyes.

30:58.246 --> 30:59.880
You know better, but it's just...

31:01.026 --> 31:01.933
natural.

31:02.875 --> 31:05.388
You want to believe there's some kind of answer there, but there's nothing.

31:07.165 --> 31:08.737
For me anyway, but...

31:09.792 --> 31:11.160
not for you, huh?

31:13.054 --> 31:16.049
There were flashes, like from a camera.

31:16.622 --> 31:19.315
And you know what else is strange? The other night, I...

31:20.054 --> 31:23.388
I dreamt in pictures... photographs.

31:23.918 --> 31:28.138
I mean, have to keep reminding myself that we're looking for a killer, not a photographer.

31:28.260 --> 31:29.879
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

31:47.937 --> 31:50.312
Planning a wedding? Shopping for a photographer?

31:51.372 --> 31:52.299
I don't know.

31:56.907 --> 31:58.197
Just an instinct.

31:59.784 --> 32:04.224
Bridgette! If you don't let me brush those knots out of your hair, we're going to have to chop it all off!

32:04.294 --> 32:06.532
Don't let her chop my head off!

32:06.891 --> 32:08.171
Chop your head off?

32:08.626 --> 32:10.368
Aw, you bringing your work home with you again?

32:10.464 --> 32:11.468
Let me at her!

32:12.042 --> 32:14.191
Um, can I make a suggestion?

32:14.483 --> 32:16.357
Why don't we call in an expert.

32:16.445 --> 32:18.554
Somebody with beautifully maintained hair,

32:18.692 --> 32:21.503
who also knows a thing or two about dealing with kids.

32:23.080 --> 32:24.144
Ariel!

32:24.774 --> 32:26.286
Oh, no!

32:27.068 --> 32:28.671
Or you can do it yourself.

32:31.072 --> 32:33.243
Foiled again!

32:40.243 --> 32:43.069
Wow. You one of those people who can talk out their ass?

32:43.182 --> 32:43.914
It's not funny.

32:44.113 --> 32:45.031
Kind of funny.

32:45.409 --> 32:46.885
Great. We have a message.

32:50.416 --> 32:52.561
Hey, it's Bill...

32:52.776 --> 32:55.233
Nice. It's someone named Bill from your office.

32:56.439 --> 33:00.293
He's calling to RSVP for my surprise party!

33:00.426 --> 33:01.235
Cool.

33:01.742 --> 33:03.189
You're actually very good at this.

33:03.309 --> 33:06.938
You're quite the little the party planner and quite the surpriser.

33:07.046 --> 33:10.462
Hey, you don't buy candy for a dentist,

33:10.579 --> 33:12.692
you don't give a kitten to a vet,

33:12.892 --> 33:16.800
and you don't waste time trying to surprise someone who's always one step ahead of you.

33:17.722 --> 33:19.556
8:00. Hmm.

33:20.184 --> 33:21.424
Tomorrow.

33:24.143 --> 33:25.258
Here?

33:26.252 --> 33:29.345
- You invited everyone here?
- Well, yeah. Why not?

33:29.435 --> 33:32.591
Well, for one thing, who are you gonna get to clean all day tomorrow

33:32.678 --> 33:34.357
so you'll be ready to have this party?

33:36.230 --> 33:37.356
You're joking.

33:37.623 --> 33:39.456
Well, I mean as long as you're not working.

33:39.910 --> 33:42.114
It's... it's my party!

33:42.318 --> 33:44.945
It's supposed to be for me! It's my birthday!

33:45.073 --> 33:46.666
That's all the more incentive to...

33:48.478 --> 33:49.789
Aren't you going to get that?

33:49.906 --> 33:54.167
Why? It's one of the wicked stepsisters calling to say she's coming to the ball,

33:54.509 --> 33:56.793
but she wants me to stop and clean her fireplace.

33:57.085 --> 33:57.894
Hello?

33:59.087 --> 33:59.813
Yes.

34:00.187 --> 34:00.990
For you.

34:03.233 --> 34:04.124
Hello.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.402
Yes, Detective Scanlon?

34:06.566 --> 34:09.699
Sorry to be calling your house so late, but you want to hear an interesting coincidence?

34:10.047 --> 34:14.322
The man who photographed Conrad's wedding also photographed Tim and Donna's.

34:14.714 --> 34:15.393
Wow.

34:16.268 --> 34:17.873
And my sister's.

34:18.522 --> 34:20.411
Feeling like paying him a visit tomorrow?

34:21.087 --> 34:21.989
Work.

34:23.371 --> 34:24.527
Tomorrow.

34:26.139 --> 34:27.768
Absolutely.

34:29.534 --> 34:32.862
As long as I'm home before 8:00.

34:34.045 --> 34:35.701
Okay. Thank you.

34:39.632 --> 34:42.387
Mr. Rondell? This is the Phoenix Police.

34:42.643 --> 34:45.331
I have a search warrant. You want to open up and let us in?

34:53.938 --> 34:55.494
Go, go, go, go!

35:01.294 --> 35:03.011
It's clear, it's all clear!

35:45.210 --> 35:47.623
Any idea how your sister found this guy?

35:58.758 --> 36:01.512
She really doesn't want you to see her like this.

36:05.675 --> 36:08.301
Detective? Mr. District Attorney?

36:12.040 --> 36:14.093
Look at the files he kept on these people.

36:15.081 --> 36:16.012
My God.

36:18.106 --> 36:22.045
What? First he'd photograph their weddings, then it's... like he owned them.

36:22.116 --> 36:24.383
He studied them. They were his test subjects.

36:24.471 --> 36:27.358
There's gotta be hundreds of contact sheets of this couple's comings and goings.

36:27.475 --> 36:28.962
They didn't even know they were being watched.

36:29.094 --> 36:32.657
Going to work, getting the mail, birthday parties...

36:33.595 --> 36:34.333
Death.

36:35.387 --> 36:37.716
He'd give them a year of marriage, and then...

36:38.536 --> 36:41.438
- just after their first anniversaries...
- I think you need to look at these.

36:48.655 --> 36:50.521
These must be works in progress.

36:51.499 --> 36:55.314
We've got wedding photos, some surveillance, but no...

36:56.261 --> 36:57.767
I wonder who's next.

37:02.322 --> 37:04.100
This couple. Tonight.

37:05.672 --> 37:07.008
How in the hell do you know that?

37:08.037 --> 37:09.630
Your sister told me.

37:22.536 --> 37:24.642
Welcome home. We've been waiting for you.

37:29.879 --> 37:33.299
Close the door, please, and step into the room, where we can see you?

37:35.343 --> 37:36.167
Thank you.

37:36.817 --> 37:40.529
We're conducting an experiment, a social experiment.

37:40.641 --> 37:45.602
And your lovely bride and I would both very much like you to participate, if you would just...

37:47.380 --> 37:48.562
Who are you?

37:49.668 --> 37:51.725
I'm Detective Lee Scanlon with the Phoenix Police,

37:51.778 --> 37:54.122
and you're under arrest for the murder of my sister, Lorraine.

37:54.216 --> 37:56.678
Now drop that gun, and I'll read you your rights.

37:58.269 --> 38:02.534
Or you can try something stupid and we'll get a priest in here to read you a different set of rights.

38:07.902 --> 38:10.322
Please, give me an excuse.

38:40.844 --> 38:42.988
Put your hands behind your head.

38:47.587 --> 38:49.844
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Fascinating.

38:50.049 --> 38:53.014
It's an absolutely fascinating display.

38:53.706 --> 38:56.684
You so obviously wanted to kill me...

38:56.833 --> 38:58.225
and easily could have.

38:59.234 --> 39:03.715
And yet, convention and society and a host of other outside forces

39:03.811 --> 39:07.605
convinced you that your own survival depended upon your ability

39:07.698 --> 39:12.724
to suppress your desire for revenge and let me live, and that's fascinating.

39:13.668 --> 39:15.670
I'm so glad I was here to see it.

39:17.718 --> 39:19.920
That was extraordinarily courageous, Lee.

39:20.048 --> 39:21.763
I'm genuinely proud to call you my friend.

39:21.844 --> 39:24.241
Ah, there was nothing courageous about it. I knew he wasn't going to shoot.

39:24.369 --> 39:25.576
Not her. Not me. Not anybody.

39:25.690 --> 39:27.318
- Oh, and how did you know that?
- Oh, Allison told me.

39:27.435 --> 39:29.974
I did not! I did not say a word to you before you went in there.

39:30.062 --> 39:32.387
You did not ? Damn. I must need a drink. Anyone interested?

39:32.499 --> 39:33.651
Wait a second. What time is it?

39:33.749 --> 39:35.975
Uh, 7:35. I do believe I'm buying.

39:36.073 --> 39:38.730
Oh, my gosh. I completely forgot. I have to rush home and get surprised.

39:38.808 --> 39:40.557
But I'll take a rain check on that drink.

39:40.644 --> 39:41.746
Oh, right, right, right...

39:43.907 --> 39:47.086
Hey, guys! Sorry I'm late for dinner!

39:47.193 --> 39:49.446
Things got crazy at work...

39:50.553 --> 39:51.515
and...

40:02.611 --> 40:03.640
Hello?

40:07.331 --> 40:08.734
Anybody home?

40:17.366 --> 40:18.462
Okay.

40:20.904 --> 40:21.995
I'll play.

40:41.588 --> 40:42.403
Hello?

41:12.633 --> 41:14.005
Happy Birthday, baby.

41:16.668 --> 41:18.890
I don't get it. Where is everybody?

41:19.165 --> 41:22.505
Well, let's see... Ariel is sleeping over at her friend Megan's house.

41:22.658 --> 41:24.496
Bridgette's sleeping over at Hannah's house.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.600
And Marie is at my sister's in Prescott.

41:26.881 --> 41:27.670
What?

41:27.900 --> 41:28.822
Surprised?

41:29.544 --> 41:30.583
Confused.

41:31.449 --> 41:35.642
Oh. Did I leave out the part where you and I go to Mexico for the weekend for your birthday?

41:39.497 --> 41:41.598
That would be the limo to take us...

41:42.652 --> 41:43.681
to the airport.

41:44.674 --> 41:48.073
What about all the party supplies... and the phone calls?

41:48.160 --> 41:51.780
It's not easy surprising someone who's always one step ahead of you.

41:59.431 --> 42:01.764
- You bastard.
- Thank you.

42:02.276 --> 42:04.048
Now hurry up and put together a bag.

42:04.488 --> 42:07.920
I'm going to go out and make sure the driver has the champagne chilling

42:08.052 --> 42:11.631
and gloat to myself over the fact that I finally put one over on you.

42:15.094 --> 42:17.135
I don't know if I can get ready that fast.

42:17.242 --> 42:20.730
Well, put your track shoes on, baby, 'cause our plane leaves in exactly one hour.

42:24.386 --> 42:27.237
Hey, Hot Lips, hurry up. Driver says there's traffic.

42:28.384 --> 42:31.087
I'm packing as fast as I can!

42:43.829 --> 42:45.398
Okay, I'm ready.

42:46.903 --> 42:48.945
I can't believe you did this to me.

42:49.064 --> 42:50.912
I hope I didn't forget anything.

42:51.624 --> 42:54.148
Just wait till your birthday comes.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
