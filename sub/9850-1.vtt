Could Teach Him.

I'm Not Gonna Be Poor."

All Those Kids, Like I Had,

They Like To Eat,
So When They Holler,

04:10.172 --> 04:12.252
They Want Some Food,
You Gotta Put
Something In Their Hand,

Michael To Make It.

To This Day, Motown Was
The Greatest School For Me.

04:29.262 --> 04:31.252
Really, It Was The Best.

As Well As Producing.

Things About Writing.

Everything About

04:40.172 --> 04:43.052

Producing And Everything.

04:43.052 --> 04:45.152

About Lyrical Content,

04:45.152 --> 04:49.202
How To Produce Songs
And Just Being A Great Artist.

04:49.202 --> 04:53.052

To Be Great,

You Had To Be Persistent,
You Had To Work.

05:11.172 --> 05:15.252

Is Probably The Greatest
Record Man That Ever Was.

That First Day
And Off The Wall.

10:47.182 --> 10:50.262
For Me, The Most
Heartbreaking

10:50.262 --> 10:52.182
Was When They Left Motown.

10:52.182 --> 10:54.262

11:11.142 --> 11:15.172
No One Ever Graduates
From Being A Cute Kid Group
To Being Taken Seriously.

11:15.172 --> 11:17.162
There's No Child Singer
That You Can Point To

11:17.162 --> 11:19.262
Besides Michael
Jackson That Went

11:19.262 --> 11:22.192
From Being Really Big
To The Biggest Pop Star Ever.

11:22.192 --> 11:24.072
Thank God For Dancing Machine.

11:42.272 --> 11:45.182
What They Were
Observing At The Time,
At Motown,

11:45.182 --> 11:47.152
What The Jacksons
Were Observing

11:47.152 --> 11:50.042
Were A Lot Of Artists
Having Creative Freedom.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.082
♪ She's A Dance, Dance, Dance,

11:57.112 --> 12:00.092
We Wanted To Write,
We Wanted To Produce Ourselves

12:00.092 --> 12:03.192
And Our Contract At Motown
Didn't Let Us Do That.

12:03.192 --> 12:05.272
And Plus, Our Contract
Was Expiring At The Time

12:05.272 --> 12:08.232
And It Was Time To
Make A New Change.

12:08.232 --> 12:12.162
Two Guys Named Ron Alexenburg
And Steve Popovich...

12:12.162 --> 12:15.122
They Were With Epic,
One Was Head Of Promotion

12:15.122 --> 12:16.212
And One Was Head Of A&AMP;R.

12:16.212 --> 12:18.152
And They Came To Me And Said,

12:18.152 --> 12:20.252
"We're Gonna Sign The Jacksons
As A Group."

12:20.252 --> 12:22.262
Ron Alexenburg: It All
Started At The Warwick Hotel

12:22.262 --> 12:25.122
And There's Nothing
But Kids Around
The Whole Hotel.

12:25.122 --> 12:27.112
I Went To The Doorman
And Asked,
"What's Going On Here?"

12:27.112 --> 12:29.052
And He Said,
"The Jackson 5 Are Here."

12:29.052 --> 12:33.062
That Gave Me The Opportunity
To Go Just The Way
I Am Into The Lobby.

12:33.062 --> 12:34.182
I Picked Up The House Phone
And I Called,

12:34.182 --> 12:36.072
I Said,
"Michael Jackson, Please."

12:36.072 --> 12:38.082
And They Rang Right
Through To Room 805,

12:38.082 --> 12:39.212
And He Came
Downstairs With His Dad.

12:39.212 --> 12:42.052
And I Looked At
Him And I Said,
"What Do You Wanna Do?"

12:42.052 --> 12:43.242
And He Said,
"Someday, I'd Like
To Do My Own Music."

12:43.242 --> 12:45.212
I Said, "Really?
What About Now?"

12:45.212 --> 12:49.112
The Group Wanted
To Leave Motown. Joseph...

12:49.112 --> 12:50.232
My Name Is Joe Jackson.

12:50.232 --> 12:52.132
Steve Popovich: ...Thought
That He Wanted To Bring Them

12:52.132 --> 12:54.062
And Take Them To
A Whole Other Level

12:54.062 --> 12:55.232
That Motown Just Couldn't Do.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.252
I Was Told Not To Sign 'Em.

12:57.252 --> 12:59.232
And I Was Told That
They Were A Cartoon Act.

12:59.232 --> 13:02.222
And I Went To
Walter Yetnikoff, Who Was
My Boss And I Said, "Hold On.

13:02.222 --> 13:04.222
"The Jacksons
Belong On This Label.

13:04.222 --> 13:06.202
"We Call Ourselves
The Family Of Music.

13:06.202 --> 13:09.102
"This Is The Family.
I Want To Sign Them."

13:09.102 --> 13:11.252
I Said, "Well, I Don't Know
How Many Records
They've Sold."

13:11.252 --> 13:14.252
So I Went To Hear At
The Westbury Music Fair.

13:14.252 --> 13:17.082
Michael Was 15
Years Old At The Time.

13:17.082 --> 13:19.152
He's Singing
A Song To A Dead Rat,

13:19.152 --> 13:21.202
Which You Remember,
Named Ben, Okay?

13:21.202 --> 13:24.062
I Come Back And I
Said To These Guys,
"Are You Crazy?

13:24.062 --> 13:26.172
[Coughs] "Sign Him And Give
Him Three And A Half
Million Dollars?"

13:26.172 --> 13:28.232
I Said, "Walter, Please.

13:28.232 --> 13:32.132
"You're New In Your Job
And You're Really Not
Qualified To Judge This."

13:32.132 --> 13:35.152
I Was In The Job,
Like, Three Weeks
When That Happened.

13:35.152 --> 13:37.162
He Was Like, "Okay,
I'll Go Along With You Guys.

13:37.162 --> 13:38.222
"You Seem To Know
What You're Doing."

13:38.222 --> 13:40.142
I Said, "You Know,
You're Probably Right."

13:40.142 --> 13:43.132
That Was My Brilliant Move
In Signing The Jacksons.

13:43.132 --> 13:45.272
♪ Like Ben ♪

13:47.142 --> 13:50.042
Chorus: ♪ Like Ben ♪

13:51.152 --> 13:55.072
-♪ Like Ben ♪
-[Audience Applauding]

13:58.232 --> 14:03.042
Michael: The Most Tense
Time Of Life For Me

14:03.042 --> 14:06.142
Was The Changing From Motown

14:06.142 --> 14:11.272
To Cbs. I Was In
A Whole Another World,
I Was... Gosh.

14:11.272 --> 14:14.082
It Was... I Didn't
Know What Was Happening.

14:14.082 --> 14:17.272
Understanding The Challenge
Of A Child Prodigy

14:17.272 --> 14:22.102
Having To Make
A Transition From Now Being
A Serious, Serious Artist.

14:22.102 --> 14:25.182
How Much Courage It Takes
To Actually Step
Outside Of That,

14:25.182 --> 14:27.182
And To Come With A New Sound.

14:27.182 --> 14:30.112
That Can Be Pretty Damn Scary.

14:30.112 --> 14:32.102
Kind Of A Critical Decision

14:32.102 --> 14:35.042
That The Jackson 5 With Their
Father, Joe Jackson,

14:35.042 --> 14:37.082
Made To Leave Motown,

14:37.082 --> 14:40.152
And It Resulted In A Lawsuit

14:40.152 --> 14:43.182
Out Of Which
Came A Name Change
To The Jacksons.

14:43.182 --> 14:45.252
I Was Told I Couldn't Use
The Name Jackson 5,

14:45.252 --> 14:47.262
And I Said, "It's Okay,
We'll Call Them The Jacksons."

14:47.262 --> 14:50.102
Joe Jackson:
'Cause Berry Gordy Would
Not Let That Name Go.

14:50.102 --> 14:54.272
We Were All Sad
That He Was Gone
And Jermaine Stayed.

14:54.272 --> 14:58.182
Jermaine Jackson Was Married
To The Daughter
Of Berry Gordy.

14:58.182 --> 15:00.162
So, Probably Not
A Good Idea For Him

15:00.162 --> 15:03.072
To Leave Motown With
The Rest Of His Family.

15:03.072 --> 15:05.082
We Respect Jermaine's Decision

15:05.082 --> 15:07.202
Because That Was
A Very Difficult Decision
For Him To Make.

15:07.202 --> 15:10.202
And I Respect Him For That
Because He Did
What He Wants To Do.

15:10.202 --> 15:12.092
I Want People To Do
What They Want To Do.

15:12.092 --> 15:13.202
Don't Do What I
Want You To Do,

15:13.202 --> 15:15.082
Do What You Feel
That's Best For You.

15:15.082 --> 15:18.232
Michael: There's So Much
Going On, So Much Tension.

15:18.232 --> 15:21.132
I Wasn't Sure What
Was Gonna Happen.

15:21.132 --> 15:22.192
I Asked Michael,

15:22.192 --> 15:24.212
"What's Gonna Happen
When People Ask You,

15:24.212 --> 15:26.202
"'Why Are You
Leaving Motown?'"

15:26.202 --> 15:29.182
He Said, "Because
Everything Is Possible
With You At Epic Records.

15:29.182 --> 15:31.162
"And There's
Nothing More To Be Said."

15:31.162 --> 15:34.172
And With Columbia Records,
We Wanna Sell
Twice As Many Records.

15:34.172 --> 15:37.132
We Want To Do The Things
That We've Dreamed Of.

15:37.132 --> 15:39.212
That Was Not A Popular Signing
In The Business.

15:39.212 --> 15:41.132
Nor Was It In The Building.

15:42.152 --> 15:44.132
Ron's Lost His Mind.

15:44.132 --> 15:46.132
You Know,
The Jacksons Have Had It.
They're Done.

15:46.132 --> 15:49.202
The Problem At That Time,
Is They Had Had
A Cartoon Series

15:49.202 --> 15:52.192
And The Credibility
Was Questionable.

15:52.192 --> 15:55.132
Chorus: ♪ Ohhh 2,4,6,8,
Who Do You Appreciated ♪

15:55.132 --> 15:57.152

16:14.142 --> 16:16.142
We Got On The Train,
Went To Philadelphia,

16:16.142 --> 16:18.142
Gamble And Huff Opened Their
Drawer Full Of Hits.

16:18.142 --> 16:22.052
When You Think Of Disco
And When You Think
Of Quality Disco,

16:22.052 --> 16:23.142
You Came To Philadelphia.

16:23.142 --> 16:26.072
Two Of The People
That Michael Jackson
Learned From, Immensely,

16:26.072 --> 16:28.152
Were Kenny
Gamble And Leon Huff,

16:28.152 --> 16:32.212
Who Were The Creators
And Entrepreneurs
Behind Philly International

16:32.212 --> 16:34.182
The Proprietors
Of The Disco Sound.

16:34.182 --> 16:37.182
They Had Always
Wanted To Write
And Produce...

16:37.182 --> 16:39.112
-Hmm.
-...Their Own Records.

16:39.112 --> 16:43.042
You Know What I Mean,
And Be A Part Of The Process.

16:43.042 --> 16:45.142
And That's Pretty Much
What Philly International Was.

16:45.142 --> 16:49.112
-It Was A Place Where We Had
A Lot Of Creative Freedom.
-Mmm-Hmm.

16:49.112 --> 16:52.272
They Wrote Tons Of Hits.
Tons, Tons Of Hits.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.152
Kenny Gamble: We Had Harold
Melvin &AMP; The Blue Notes.

16:54.152 --> 16:56.252
-We Had The O'jays.
-Interviewer: Go Through
The Roster.

16:56.252 --> 16:58.252
We Had Patti Labelle.

16:58.252 --> 17:00.112
Interviewer: Archie Bell
&AMP; The Drells.

17:00.112 --> 17:02.192
-Gamble: Phyllis Hyman.
-Interviewer: Billy Paul.

17:02.192 --> 17:05.041
-Lou Rawls.
We Had Teddy Pendergrass.
-Leon Huff: Three Degrees.

17:05.041 --> 17:06.152
Gamble: Three Degrees.

17:06.152 --> 17:09.252
We Had To Style These Songs
To Fit These Guys' Voices.

17:09.252 --> 17:11.271
-Interviewer: And That's What
Great Producers Do, Right?
-Sure.

17:11.271 --> 17:14.041
We're Right Almost
In The Middle Of

17:14.041 --> 17:16.071
A Recording Session
With The Jacksons.

17:16.071 --> 17:20.061
And Guess Who Is Producing
Their Brand New Album.

17:20.061 --> 17:22.132
-Gamble And Huff.
-That's Right.

17:22.132 --> 17:25.212
Now, Why Would You Guys Come
All The Way In From California

17:25.212 --> 17:29.142
To Cut Some Sides In An Album
In Philadelphia?

17:29.142 --> 17:33.052
Because Gamble &AMP; Huff's
Organization Is Here

17:33.052 --> 17:36.162
And They're Two Of
The Best Producers
In The World.

17:36.162 --> 17:39.042
Working With Gamble And Huff
They Do It In
A Little Quicker Pace.

17:39.042 --> 17:40.222
It Takes Three Weeks
To Make A Record.

17:40.222 --> 17:43.052
I Didn't Know You Could Make
A Record In Three Weeks,
A Whole Album.

17:43.052 --> 17:46.102
They Were The Jimmy Jam
And Terry Lewis Of The '70s.

17:46.102 --> 17:47.242
And Michael Always Says
That He Learned A Lot

17:47.242 --> 17:51.102
About The Songwriting Process
From Kenny Gamble
And Leon Huff.

17:51.102 --> 17:54.122
How To Structure A Song.
How To Create
Great Arrangements.

17:54.122 --> 17:57.042
The Jacksons
Came To Philadelphia
For Two Years

17:57.042 --> 18:01.082
To Record Two Records,
The Jacksons And Goin' Places.

18:01.082 --> 18:05.082
We Try To Write Songs
That People Do All The Time,

18:05.082 --> 18:07.152
Or People Say

18:07.152 --> 18:11.152

Eager To Learn.

19:00.262 --> 19:02.272
One Of The Most
Important Things

19:02.272 --> 19:05.172
To Being Successful
Is Listening.

19:05.172 --> 19:09.182
It's Listening And Watching
And Being A Good Person
To Work With.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.222
Easy To Work With.

19:10.222 --> 19:12.042
Every Song Is A Negotiation.

19:12.042 --> 19:14.062
Every Production
Is A Negotiation

19:14.062 --> 19:16.112
If You Are Co-Doing It
With Someone.

19:16.112 --> 19:19.152
Michael: The Producer Wanted
Me To Pronounce Words
A Certain Way.

19:19.152 --> 19:23.152
There Was A Song
And There's A Line In It
Where He Sings...

19:23.152 --> 19:27.262
♪ I'm A Man That's
For All Seasons ♪

19:27.262 --> 19:31.272
♪ And What The City Offers Me

19:31.272 --> 19:35.212
"Ain't Naturally,"
He Sings That And I Go,
"That's Bad English."

19:35.212 --> 19:38.072
[Chuckles] So, I Say,
"Hang On, Mike,"
And I Come Out.

19:38.072 --> 19:42.182
And I Said, "So, It's Like,
'Isn't Naturally.' Naturally?
Or 'Isn't Natural.'"

19:42.182 --> 19:44.262
Michael: I Told Him,
You Pronounce
The Word So Precisely,

19:44.262 --> 19:47.062
It Takes Away From
The Feeling Of The Song

19:47.062 --> 19:50.152
And We Got Into
A Little Thing With That.
[Chuckles]

19:50.152 --> 19:53.092
There's A Lot Of Give And Take
And Sometimes You
Don't Wanna Give.

19:53.092 --> 19:55.052
Or Sometimes You
Give But You Feel Like,

19:55.052 --> 19:56.222
"I Should Have Left
It The Way It Was."

19:56.222 --> 19:59.272
Something Said, In My Brain,
"Shut The Fuck Up.

19:59.272 --> 20:02.102
"Stop Being
The Grammar Police.

20:02.102 --> 20:05.042
"This Guy Is A Genius.
Just Get Out Of His Way."

20:05.042 --> 20:07.272
Michael: I Was Right,
And I Won. [Laughs]

20:07.272 --> 20:10.242
But It Was
A Good Learning Point.

20:10.242 --> 20:16.092
You Want To 100%
Express Your Idea.

20:16.092 --> 20:18.182
It's Just 100%
Expression Of Me.

20:18.182 --> 20:19.242
We Have Two Albums...

20:19.242 --> 20:21.152
I Mean, Two Singles
On The Album

20:21.152 --> 20:23.212
Coming Out In
December On Epic.

20:23.212 --> 20:26.152
First Time We've Written
Some Songs On The Album.

20:26.152 --> 20:28.202
It Was A Different Style,
But Still It Was A Hit Record

20:28.202 --> 20:30.142
So When We Start
Putting That Together

20:30.142 --> 20:33.082
With What We Heard
Amongst The Brothers,

20:33.082 --> 20:35.202
It Created Our
Own Style Of Music.

20:35.202 --> 20:37.042
Michael: It's Time To Write.

20:37.042 --> 20:38.142
Something Let You
Know That It's Time

20:38.142 --> 20:40.152
For You To Go Out
And Do It Yourself.

20:40.152 --> 20:44.202
So We Decided To Write
And Produce Our Own Songs.

20:44.202 --> 20:46.122
And We Finally Did.

20:46.122 --> 20:48.162
And We Went Through So Much

20:50.232 --> 20:52.202
With People Not
Believing In Your Work

20:52.202 --> 20:54.192
Or Saying, "Are You Sure?
You Sure?"

20:54.192 --> 20:58.042
And We Said,
"Yeah, We Know We Can.
We Know What We Can Do."

20:58.042 --> 21:00.152
We Went In And We
Wrote The Destiny Album.

21:00.152 --> 21:02.212
I Felt It Was Something
That Came Within, From Us.

21:02.212 --> 21:05.092
And This Is The Jacksons.

21:05.092 --> 21:06.242
This Is Us Today.

21:06.242 --> 21:09.102
On The Destiny Album,
Which Is The Album
That Comes Out In 1978,

21:09.102 --> 21:11.072
A Year Prior To Off The Wall,

21:11.072 --> 21:13.142
He's Starting To Make
Those Moves, He Wrote

21:13.142 --> 21:15.132
Shake Your Body
(Down To The Ground).

21:15.132 --> 21:17.122
Interviewer: Where Were You
When You First Heard
About That Record?

21:17.122 --> 21:19.192
-How Did It Happen?
-Michael: He Was At Home

21:19.192 --> 21:22.052
-And Randy Was Playing
This Groove On The Piano.
-Interviewer: Mmm-Hmm.

21:22.052 --> 21:23.172
[Michael Humming]

21:23.172 --> 21:25.232
I Said, "What Is That?"
He Said, "This Is Nothing."

21:25.232 --> 21:27.232
I Said, "Don't Say That.
It Is Something."

21:27.232 --> 21:30.212
-And I Just Started
Singing To His Playing.
-Interviewer: Mmm-Hmm.

21:30.212 --> 21:32.062
And It Came About.

21:32.062 --> 21:34.082
I Called Some Of
My Friends Out Here

21:34.082 --> 21:36.112
That I Had A Lot Of Respect
For That Knew How To Arrange.

21:36.112 --> 21:42.052
I Thought The Key To
Really Making An Album,
Of A Vocal Band Like This,

21:42.052 --> 21:45.052
Is Obviously Great Musicians,
Great Arrangements.

21:45.052 --> 21:49.202
Bobby Colomby Convinced Me
That I Should Get
More Into Arranging.

21:49.202 --> 21:51.182
He Said, "And Here's Who
You're Gonna Do It With."

21:51.182 --> 21:54.072
And Next Thing You Know,
I'm In A Room
With The Jacksons.

21:54.072 --> 21:57.052
Then We Brought Greg In
To Come And Help
Us With The Record

21:57.052 --> 21:59.062
On Destiny Album Again.

21:59.062 --> 22:01.132
-Yeah. Amazing.
-Then...

22:01.132 --> 22:03.192
Everybody Was Using
Greg Phillinganes.

22:03.192 --> 22:05.132
It Was...

22:05.132 --> 22:08.262
When I First Heard The Demo
For Shake Your Body,
It Was...

22:08.262 --> 22:12.122
Obviously, The Melody
Was There.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.192
Which Was Very Strong.

22:14.192 --> 22:19.072
And They Had
The Basic Piano Part.

22:19.072 --> 22:21.072
That You Hear...
[Humming]

22:21.072 --> 22:22.202
All That Rhythm Was There.

22:22.202 --> 22:24.122
♪ You Walk Around This Town ♪

22:24.122 --> 22:26.192
♪ With Your Head All Up
In The Sky ♪

22:26.192 --> 22:29.132
♪ And I Do Know
That I Want Ya ♪

22:30.262 --> 22:34.272
But There Wasn't As Much
Going On Rhythmically.

22:34.272 --> 22:36.072
Greg Came Up With This...

22:36.072 --> 22:39.192
[Mimicking Instruments]

22:39.192 --> 22:42.262
[Mimicking Instruments]

22:42.262 --> 22:45.042
That's The Rhythm Of
Shake Your Body
(Down To The Ground)

22:45.042 --> 22:48.242
Which The Average
Song Was More Like...
[Mimicking Instruments]

22:48.242 --> 22:50.062
It Fit Perfectly.

22:50.062 --> 22:51.122
At First, When He
Came Up With That Beat,

22:51.122 --> 22:52.232
I Said, "What Is
This Guy Doing?"

22:52.232 --> 22:55.112
I Said That To Myself.
I Didn't Say Anything.

22:55.112 --> 22:58.112
But I Waited
Until He Played It.

22:58.112 --> 23:01.122
And When He Played It,
When We Heard
It In The Record,

23:01.122 --> 23:03.252
I Said, "Oh, My God!
This Is The Bomb."
[Laughing]

23:03.252 --> 23:06.092
'Cause I Had Never Heard
A Beat Like That Before.

23:06.092 --> 23:08.232
-It Was Incredible.
Great Beat.
-Mmm-Hmm.

23:08.232 --> 23:11.162
I Said, "If The Jacksons
Ever Need A Drummer,

23:11.162 --> 23:13.162
"Let Them Know Your
Friend Is In Town."

23:13.162 --> 23:15.242
The Guy's Name
Is James Mcfield,
Keyboard Player,

23:15.242 --> 23:17.172
Who Got Me The Audition.

23:17.172 --> 23:19.212
And Tito Said,
He Had His Arm On His Guitar
And He Said,

23:19.212 --> 23:21.042
"Let's Play Shake
Your Body Down."

23:21.042 --> 23:23.092
Like This Kinda Look He Said,
"You Know That One?"

23:23.092 --> 23:24.192
So I Start Playing The Beat.

23:24.192 --> 23:27.052
[Drums Beating]

23:27.052 --> 23:28.152
And They're
Looking At Each Other,

23:28.152 --> 23:30.172
The Jackson
Brothers Are Whispering
In Each Other's Ears.

23:30.172 --> 23:33.042
And He's Looking,
And I'm Like Saying,
"Oh, No. I'm Blowing It."

23:33.042 --> 23:34.182
Because That
Beat Is Very Tricky.

23:34.182 --> 23:36.242
You Have To Know
When And How To Cross

23:36.242 --> 23:39.072
Your Arms To Make
The Times Happen,

23:39.072 --> 23:40.252
The Intricate Hi-Hat Happen,

23:40.252 --> 23:43.232
And Keep The Beat Going
Without Losing
Any Of The Elements.

23:43.232 --> 23:46.162
And Then Randy Said,
"Nobody Can Play That Beat.

23:46.162 --> 23:48.112
"That Was
A Three-Part Overdub."

23:48.112 --> 23:51.182
And I Said, "Really?
I Thought The Guy
Played It At One Time."

23:51.182 --> 23:53.182
And He Was Shocked And Amazed
I Could Play It.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.222
And He Said,
"You're Our Drummer."

23:55.222 --> 23:58.212
Marlon Jackson: We Had Tom
Tom 84 Doing The Horn
Arrangements,

23:58.212 --> 24:01.142
Who Is A Horn

24:01.142 --> 24:03.122
Who Did All The Earth,
Wind &AMP; Fire's.

24:03.122 --> 24:07.272
And Then We Got
Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire
Horn Players To Come In

24:07.272 --> 24:09.042
And Play...

24:09.042 --> 24:12.202
[Mimicking Instruments]

24:12.202 --> 24:14.072
Horn Players Love That Lick.

24:14.072 --> 24:19.122
It's As Dissonant
And Tension-Provoking Verse...

24:19.122 --> 24:23.152
Musically... I'm Like,
"What's Going On?

24:23.152 --> 24:26.142
"Where Is The Bridge?
Where's The Solo?
When Do We..."

24:26.142 --> 24:28.142
I'm Just Used To Other Form.

24:28.142 --> 24:30.232
Epic's Really Not
Interested In Them At All.

24:30.232 --> 24:34.082
At This Point, It Was Like,
"God, We Gotta Put This Out."

24:34.082 --> 24:36.182
I Get A Call From Paris Eley.

24:36.182 --> 24:39.062
He's Head Of Promotion
For The R&AMP;B Department.

24:39.062 --> 24:41.202

29:05.272 --> 29:07.262
And Sammy Davis Jr.'S
Another One Of My Favorites.

29:07.262 --> 29:10.142
-Interviewer: You Can't Go
Wrong Watching Sammy Davis Jr.
-Michael: Oh, Yeah.

29:10.142 --> 29:12.202
To Watch Him,
[Swallows]

29:12.202 --> 29:17.102
And Suddenly See
Little Flashes...

29:17.102 --> 29:19.162
Flatteringly I Say
This About Myself.

29:19.162 --> 29:22.132
Little Flashes Of
Me There And Go, Wow...

29:22.132 --> 29:24.172
But He's Extended It.

29:24.172 --> 29:26.182
He's Changed It,
He's Colored It

29:26.182 --> 29:28.172
Till It Becomes His Own.

29:28.172 --> 29:30.212
He Introduced Me
To Fred Astaire
And All These Movies.

29:30.212 --> 29:32.152
I Had No Idea Who The Hell
These People Were

29:32.152 --> 29:34.152
-Prior To That.
-Interviewer: Mmm-Hmm.

29:34.152 --> 29:39.152
And He Just Opened Up My Eyes
To A Whole Another
World Of Inspiration.

29:39.152 --> 29:42.172
I Just Wanna Let You Know
I Have All Your Films On Tape

29:42.172 --> 29:46.172
And I Watch Them All The Time.
And I Wanna Ask
You One Question.

29:46.172 --> 29:49.262
How Do You Do That Thing
When You Walk
On The Ceiling

29:49.262 --> 29:51.272
-[Fred Astaire Laughing]
-And You Dance...

29:51.272 --> 29:53.232
Michael: Really, I Wanna
Know How Did That Work?

29:53.232 --> 29:55.232
Astaire: The Whole Room
And The Camera Turned.

29:55.232 --> 29:57.142
Michael: So They
Both Turned, Right?

29:57.142 --> 29:59.042
-Astaire: Yes.
-[Tapping]

30:28.192 --> 30:31.062
Michael's Dance
Is Based On Energy

30:31.062 --> 30:35.062
And He Moves Like
An Electric Eel.

30:35.062 --> 30:38.072
I Think The Adjective
"Electric" Is Good For Him.

30:38.072 --> 30:42.192
He's Charged With Energy,
But He Has
The Good Inner Sense,

30:42.192 --> 30:45.052
Or Wherever It Comes From,
His Brain Or Wherever,

30:45.052 --> 30:48.112
To Just Take It Down
And Then Up Again, Quickly,

30:48.112 --> 30:50.192
Which Good Dancers
Naturally Have.

30:50.192 --> 30:55.242
I Came Out After The War,
After I Was In The Navy,

30:55.242 --> 30:58.262
And I Wanted To
Dance The Common Man.
I Didn't Want To Dance

30:58.262 --> 31:02.262
In White Tie Or A Tuxedo
And Dressed Up.

31:02.262 --> 31:06.262
I Wanted To
Roll Up My Sleeves,
And Wear Jeans And T-Shirts.

31:06.262 --> 31:09.272
The Nearest Thing I Could Get
To Dancing Shoes Were Loafers,

31:09.272 --> 31:13.192
And The White Socks
And The Rolled-Up Jeans.

31:13.192 --> 31:18.122
And He's Dancing
From The Streets,
Like I Was. I Believe That.

31:18.122 --> 31:23.042
I Was A Teenager,
And I Was Getting Older.
I Started To Really Understand

31:23.272 --> 31:26.112
The Power Of Dance.

31:26.112 --> 31:31.162
The Way He Could Spin,
Stop On A Dime
And Point With Such Intensity,

31:31.162 --> 31:32.272
That's The Power
I'm Talking About.

31:32.272 --> 31:35.242
When I Perfect
A Certain Amount Of Moves,

31:35.242 --> 31:40.202
There Is Beauty In Simplicity,
In Really Stripping
Things Down

31:40.202 --> 31:42.042
And I Learned That From Him.

31:42.042 --> 31:43.242
He Impacted Everything
For Me, Absolutely.

31:43.242 --> 31:45.162
He Impacted My
Game On The Court,

31:45.162 --> 31:47.252
He Impacted Me Now,
To This Day,
And How I Learn.

31:47.252 --> 31:51.062
Watching Him Was Like
Something I'd
Never Seen Before.

31:51.062 --> 31:53.242
It Was Something
That Was Magical,
That Was Creative,

31:53.242 --> 31:56.262
That Seemed Like
Something That I Could Mimic.

31:56.262 --> 31:59.202
That's How I Found
My Love For Dance

31:59.202 --> 32:01.172
Before I Found
Classical Ballet.

32:01.172 --> 32:03.132
I Used To Ask Him, I Said,
"Man, How Much
Do You Practice?"

32:03.132 --> 32:07.132
He Said,
"You Know, I Would Dance
Until I Can't Dance No More."

32:07.132 --> 32:08.272
I Said, "What Do You Mean?"

32:08.272 --> 32:12.132
He Said,
"I Dance Till My Legs...
I Physically Could Not Move."

32:12.132 --> 32:18.042
There's A Lot Of People
Who Just Don't Have
That Same Type Of Drive.

32:18.042 --> 32:21.252
You See It In
An Artist Like Beyonce,
That Kind Of Drive.

32:21.252 --> 32:23.222
A Lot Of Times,
When It Comes
To Black Artists,

32:23.222 --> 32:26.172
This Happens With Basquiat,
It Happened With Miles Davis,

32:26.172 --> 32:27.222
With Michael Jackson,

32:27.222 --> 32:30.052
People Talk About
Their Natural Gifts,

32:30.052 --> 32:33.092
As If There's Not
Strategy And Skill And Craft,

32:33.092 --> 32:35.112
As If Miles Davis
Didn't Go To Juilliard,

32:35.112 --> 32:38.212
Or Basquiat Didn't Know
Who Monet And Renoir Were,

32:38.212 --> 32:41.172
Or Michael Jackson
Hadn't Been Doing This
His Entire Life.

32:41.172 --> 32:44.122
Some Of My Favorite Writers
Are Johnny Mercer,

32:44.122 --> 32:49.062
Irving Berlin,
George Gershwin,
Duke Ellington, Count Basie.

32:49.062 --> 32:50.182
No, No, No, You Gotta
Put The Work In, Man.

32:50.182 --> 32:52.102
You Gotta Put The Time In.

32:52.102 --> 32:54.172
And Really, Man,
It's Love That
You Put In There.

32:54.172 --> 32:56.052
You Know, 'Cause People
That Do This Kind Of Stuff,

32:56.052 --> 32:57.252
Man, We Love What We Do.

32:57.252 --> 33:00.072
This Is Dated
November 6, 1979.

33:00.072 --> 33:03.082
He Was On The Road
With His Brothers
On The "Destiny" Tour.

33:03.082 --> 33:06.102
[Reading]
"Mj Will Be My New Name.
No More Michael Jackson.

33:06.102 --> 33:09.052
"I Want A Whole New Character,
A Whole New Look,

33:09.052 --> 33:11.072
"I Should Be
A Totally Different Person.

33:11.072 --> 33:15.152
"People Should Never
Think Of Me As The Kid
Who Sang Abc, I Want You Back.

33:15.152 --> 33:18.062
"I Should Be A New,
Incredible Actor,

33:18.062 --> 33:20.262
"Singer, Dancer That
Will Shock The World.

33:20.262 --> 33:23.092
"I Will Do No Interviews.
I Will Be Magic.

33:23.092 --> 33:27.052
"I Will Be A Perfectionist,
A Researcher,
A Trainer, A Masterer.

33:27.052 --> 33:30.132
"I Will Be Better

33:30.132 --> 33:33.182
"I Must Have The Most
Incredible Training System,

"To Dig And Dig

33:36.252 --> 33:38.152
"I Will Study And Look Back

33:38.152 --> 33:41.112
"On The Whole
World Of Entertainment,
And Perfect It,

33:41.112 --> 33:44.252
"Take It Steps Further
From Where
The Greatest Left Off."

33:44.252 --> 33:46.242
Interviewer: You Guys Are
Really Riding A Big High Now

33:46.242 --> 33:49.142
As Far As Producing
Records And So On.

33:49.142 --> 33:51.112
You Think This Is The Peak
Of Your Career Now,

33:51.112 --> 33:53.052
Or Have You Gone
Down A Little Bit,

33:53.052 --> 33:55.072
Or Are You Expecting
Bigger And Better Things?

33:55.072 --> 33:56.272
Interviewer: What Are You
Looking Forward To
In The Future, Michael?

33:56.272 --> 33:59.252
Recording Other Artists
And Going Into Acting.

33:59.252 --> 34:01.142
We Get A Lot Of Scripts In,

34:01.142 --> 34:05.102
But We Haven't
Found The Exact Script
That We Want To Use.

34:05.102 --> 34:08.062
-Interviewer: Mmm-Hmm.
-So, We're Picking
And Deciding.

34:08.062 --> 34:10.172
Think You May Be
A Big Movie Star One Day, Huh?

34:10.172 --> 34:12.042
Yeah, I'd Like
To Give It A Try.

34:12.042 --> 34:13.242
Yeah, It's A Good
Business To Be In.

34:13.242 --> 34:15.212
You've Got
The Looks, You Know.

34:15.212 --> 34:18.232
-Fortunately, I Didn't...
-[Scattered Laughter
From Audience]

34:18.232 --> 34:22.042
-What?
-[Audience Laughing]

34:22.042 --> 34:26.052
Man: With The Advent
Of Motion Pictures,
Came An Abundance Of Oz Films.

34:26.052 --> 34:30.121
A 1925 Version
Starred Oliver Hardy
As The Tin Man.

34:30.121 --> 34:32.202
And Who'll Ever
Forget The 1939

34:32.202 --> 34:36.121
Mgm Musical Version
Starring Judy Garland.

34:36.121 --> 34:42.081
In 1974, The Wiz Opened
On Broadway,
Winning Seven Tony Awards.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.101
I Was A Senior In High School,

34:45.202 --> 34:50.101
And There Was This Girl
Named Barbara Hampton,
Who I Liked,

34:50.101 --> 34:51.272
And I Wanted To Impress Her.

34:51.272 --> 34:54.202
I Was Working At
Baskin-Robbins.

34:54.202 --> 34:58.182
I Just Saved My Money,
I Finally Got Enough
Courage To Ask Her,

34:58.182 --> 35:01.102
"Would You Like To Go
See The Wiz With Me?

35:01.102 --> 35:03.152
"I Got Two Great Seats.
They're Center Aisle."

35:03.152 --> 35:05.202
She Said,
"No, I Don't Think So."

35:05.202 --> 35:09.152
[Laughing]

35:09.152 --> 35:12.152
Scalped Them For
Double The Price.

35:12.152 --> 35:15.102
I Took Michael
The First Time To See The Wiz,
He Went Back 30 More Times.

35:15.102 --> 35:19.202
The Wiz, When It Came
Out In 1978,

35:19.202 --> 35:23.172
Was Lumet's Movie Adaptation
Of That Great,
Long-Running Play

35:23.172 --> 35:25.222
That Was On Broadway
With Stephanie Mills.

35:25.222 --> 35:27.212
♪ So It's Real ♪

35:27.212 --> 35:30.262
♪ Real, Real, Real... ♪

35:30.262 --> 35:33.212
There Was A Great Debate,
At Least In My Neighborhood,

35:33.212 --> 35:35.182
That, Diana Ross Was Dope,

35:35.182 --> 35:37.142
But The Only Reason
Why They Cast Her
Is 'Cause She's Diana Ross.

35:37.142 --> 35:39.202
Stephanie Mills
Would Have Been
A Better Fit For The Film,

35:39.202 --> 35:42.162
But For Whatever Reason,
She Didn't Get The Job.

35:42.162 --> 35:45.122
We're Not Gonna Do It
With An Unknown,
Young Actress.

35:45.122 --> 35:49.092
We Have To Have The Star Power
To Make It "Cross Over."

35:49.092 --> 35:51.102
It Also Was...

35:51.102 --> 35:55.042
The Most Expensive
Movie Ever Made

35:55.042 --> 35:57.222
With An All
African-American Cast.

35:57.222 --> 36:00.202
Interviewer: So, Because
Of Car Wash And Sparkle,

36:00.202 --> 36:03.042
-You Know,
This Happens In Hollywood,
-Joel Schumacher: Mmm-Hmm.

36:03.042 --> 36:05.272
Were You Designated
As The Go-To Guy
For Black Material?

36:05.272 --> 36:07.262
-I Was The Black Writer.
-Interviewer:
The Black Writer, Huh?

36:07.262 --> 36:12.142
And Sidney Was
Probably The Number One
American Director Right Then,

36:12.142 --> 36:15.102
'Cause He Had Done
Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon,

36:15.102 --> 36:17.102
Network,
Murder On The Orient Express,

36:17.102 --> 36:18.152
I Think, All In A Row.

36:18.152 --> 36:19.242
-He Was King.
-Interviewer: Right.

36:19.242 --> 36:21.082
And Definitely,
King Of New York.

36:21.082 --> 36:24.152
Michael Was Desperate
To Play The Scarecrow.

36:24.152 --> 36:26.162
He Always Wanted To
Have A Film Career.

36:26.162 --> 36:28.122
There Was Some Rumor
That He Was Supposed To Star

36:28.122 --> 36:30.132
In The Frankie Lymon Story.
That Never Happened.

36:30.132 --> 36:32.152
The Wiz Was
Supposed To Be A Huge Film.

36:32.152 --> 36:35.062
Diana Ross, His Longtime Pal,
Was Starring In It.

36:35.062 --> 36:38.232
He's No Longer At Motown,
And Michael
Called Berry Gordy.

36:38.232 --> 36:40.262
We Were Doing The Wiz.

36:40.262 --> 36:43.132
Rob Cohen Was Handling It.

36:43.132 --> 36:46.132
He Was Working
For Me At The Time
With Motown Productions.

36:46.132 --> 36:48.122
It Would Have Been
Very Easy For Him To Say,

36:48.122 --> 36:50.092
"Well, You Know, Michael,
You're Gone Now,

36:50.092 --> 36:52.112
"And I Think We'll
Find Somebody Else."

36:52.112 --> 36:54.252
Sidney Was Adamant
That He Didn't Want Michael.

36:54.252 --> 36:56.262
He Felt Michael Was Over,

36:56.262 --> 37:02.072
And Had Been A Cute,
Little Kid, Musical Star,
But Hadn't Grown Into It.

37:02.072 --> 37:06.202
And I Just Said,
"You're Making A Mistake,
And I Want You To Meet Him."

37:06.202 --> 37:09.042
Of Course, Lumet Fell
In Love With Michael.

37:09.042 --> 37:12.072
Sidney Lumet: Michael May Be
The Purest Talent
I've Ever Seen.

37:12.072 --> 37:14.192
He's Incapable
Of A False Moment.

37:14.192 --> 37:19.132
He's So True That
Anything Around Him
Has To Become True.

37:19.132 --> 37:21.042
If You Don't Work
Honestly Around Him,

37:21.042 --> 37:22.202
You're Gonna Look
As If You're Faking It.

37:22.202 --> 37:24.122
Well, Yeah, He's
All Those Things,

37:24.122 --> 37:28.172
Plus, This Kid Can Dance
And Sing Like Nobody Else.

37:28.172 --> 37:33.162
It Was So Obvious,
The Genius Of This Boy,
I Mean, It Was So Effortless.

37:33.162 --> 37:35.252
When I Was Real Small,
When I Saw
The Original Wizard Of Oz,

37:35.252 --> 37:37.162
The Judy Garland Version,

37:37.162 --> 37:39.262
I Always Fell In
Love With The Scarecrow,
I Think Most Kids Do,

37:39.262 --> 37:42.192
Because You Feel Sorry
For Him, And Everything,

37:42.192 --> 37:44.052
And His Character.

37:44.052 --> 37:46.072
And I Always Watched Him.

37:46.072 --> 37:48.052
Matter Of Fact,
I Had The Step Down They Did,

37:48.052 --> 37:50.142
When I Was Around Six,
I Would Do It All
Around The House.

37:50.142 --> 37:51.172

Quincy Jones: He'd Come In
For A Five-Hour
Makeup Call In The Morning,

38:38.172 --> 38:40.202
Get The Makeup Out Of The Way,

38:40.202 --> 38:44.102
Right On The Case, He Knew
Everybody's Lines,
Everybody's Songs

38:44.102 --> 38:47.232
He Knew Everybody's Position,
And He Stood There,
Almost At Attention.

38:47.232 --> 38:51.082
I Saw This Uncanny
Type Of Discipline
In Such A Young Person.

38:51.082 --> 38:53.122
Quincy, Of Course,
Was The Musical Director.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.222
He Was Doing
The Score For The Wiz.

38:54.222 --> 38:56.132
You See Him
For A Minute, Right?

38:56.132 --> 38:59.112
You See Him For
A Minute Conducting
The Band In The Movie.

38:59.112 --> 39:01.172
And I Was A Quincy Fan.

39:01.172 --> 39:05.272
You Know, Smackwater Jack,
Walking In Space,
Body Heat, All That Stuff.

39:05.272 --> 39:07.252
The Wiz Seemed Like
A Great Combination

39:07.252 --> 39:09.192
Of All These Things
That He Could Do.

39:09.192 --> 39:13.072
Lumet Was Very Happy
To Have Quincy. We All Were.

39:13.072 --> 39:15.102
That Just, Kind Of, Guaranteed

39:15.102 --> 39:19.212
The Musical Portion
Would Hit A Strong,
Popular Chord.

39:19.212 --> 39:21.232
He Didn't Actually
Have A Feature Number

39:21.232 --> 39:23.212
In The Film When
They Hired Him.

39:23.212 --> 39:26.232
They Didn't Know
About The Dancing,
A Lot Of Things...

39:26.232 --> 39:30.162
Eventually,
Everybody Came To Understand
What He Was All About.

39:31.132 --> 39:33.262
♪ You Can't Win ♪

39:33.262 --> 39:35.222
♪ You Can't Break Even ♪

39:35.222 --> 39:39.082
♪ And You Can't
Get Out Of The Game ♪

39:39.082 --> 39:41.212
♪ People Keep Sayin' ♪

39:41.212 --> 39:43.132
♪ Things Are Gonna Change ♪

39:43.132 --> 39:46.222
♪ But They Look Just Like
They're Staying The Same ♪

39:46.222 --> 39:49.132
Jones: But I Don't Think
They Showed
Enough Of His Dancing.

39:49.132 --> 39:53.052
The Real Night That
Off The Wall Was Born,

39:53.052 --> 39:55.272
We Were Doing
The Pre-Records For The Movie.

39:55.272 --> 40:01.062
Quincy Had, Like,
Tunnel-Vision On Diana Ross.

40:01.062 --> 40:03.112
Finally, About 2:00 A.M.,
[Chuckles]

40:03.112 --> 40:06.152
Q Had What He
Wanted From Diana,

40:06.152 --> 40:09.192
And He Goes, "Okay, Michael,
You Come In On Bar 6."

40:09.192 --> 40:11.112
-And Michael's Part,
Like, Had...
-Michael: Ha!

40:11.112 --> 40:13.142
-A Thousand Watts.
-Michael: Ha! Uh!

40:13.142 --> 40:18.102
He's Doing Everything
That Became
The Signature Michael Jackson.

40:18.102 --> 40:20.122
-[Grunting]
-[Interviewer Laughs]

40:20.122 --> 40:22.112
Michael: Come On, Dorothy!
Come On!

40:22.112 --> 40:26.212
And, It Was Like A Lioness
Who Just Suddenly
Sees A Baby Goat.

40:26.212 --> 40:27.232
[Laughs]

40:27.232 --> 40:29.182
It Was Just...

40:29.182 --> 40:30.252
The More I Knew Him,

40:30.252 --> 40:33.132
And The More I
Became Fascinated

40:33.132 --> 40:35.272
With The Idea Of, Maybe,
Working With Him.

40:35.272 --> 40:37.232
It Was A Lot Of Fun
Working With All The Greats,

40:37.232 --> 40:41.152
Sidney Lumet, Quincy Jones,
Everybody.

40:41.152 --> 40:46.052
I May Be One Of The Few People
Who Really Loved The Wiz.

40:46.052 --> 40:50.042
There's Some Great
Representation, On Film,
That We Hadn't Seen Before.

40:50.042 --> 40:52.132
When The Wiz Came Out,
I Was 7 Years Old.

40:52.132 --> 40:56.172
That Was An Event
For Black America.

40:56.172 --> 40:57.252
I Can't Speak For
All Of New York City,

40:57.252 --> 40:59.172
I Can't Speak For
All Of The Country.

40:59.172 --> 41:01.172
But Everybody
In My Neighborhood, In Harlem,

41:01.172 --> 41:04.052
Was Going To See The Wiz
Because Of Mike Jackson.

41:04.052 --> 41:06.052
So, This Is A Big Moment
For Michael Jackson.

41:06.052 --> 41:09.072
He Gets To Fulfill
His Acting Desires,

41:09.072 --> 41:11.202
And He's Finally In
A Big Hollywood Film.

41:11.202 --> 41:14.042
So, He And His Sister,
La Toya, Move To New York.

41:14.042 --> 41:18.062
I Found Them An Apartment
On 400 East 56th
Street Off 4th Avenue.

41:18.062 --> 41:20.242
Jason King: In The Summer
Of '77, A Legendary Summer,

41:20.242 --> 41:23.142
There Were Blackouts,
There Was A Serial Killer,

41:23.142 --> 41:24.252
David Berkowitz,
The Son Of Sam,

41:24.252 --> 41:26.202
Who Was Doing All
These Random Killings,

41:26.202 --> 41:28.062
People Were Terrified.

41:28.062 --> 41:29.252
The First Summer Of Disco,
It Was The Time

41:29.252 --> 41:33.102
In Which All Of These
Nascent Music Forms
Were Coming Up.

41:33.102 --> 41:36.182
Punk, Hip-Hop,
Disco Was Huge,

41:36.182 --> 41:38.112
And There Were All
These Different Elements

41:38.112 --> 41:39.212
That Were Happening
In New York
At The Same Time,

41:39.212 --> 41:41.182
That Were Sort Of
Coming In Contact

41:41.182 --> 41:43.062
With Each Other Or
Clashing With Each Other.

41:43.062 --> 41:45.102
I Have A Feeling That's
Probably Where He First Heard

41:45.102 --> 41:46.192
A Lot Of Early Hip-Hop,

41:46.192 --> 41:48.172
The Beatboxing That
He's Basically Doing

41:48.172 --> 41:49.272
On A Song Like
Working Day And Night.

41:49.272 --> 41:51.152
Even Though He Was
Only 19, He Was Going

41:51.152 --> 41:53.092
To Studio 54 On
A Regular Basis.

41:53.092 --> 41:56.072
Perhaps You've Heard
The Name Studio 54.

41:56.072 --> 41:58.062
It Attracts The Rich
And The Famous,

41:58.062 --> 41:59.242
The Glamorous
And The Powerful.

41:59.242 --> 42:02.222
They Come To This Disco Palace
In New York City

42:02.222 --> 42:04.182
Just About Any
Night Of The Week.

42:04.182 --> 42:07.112
King: He Was Making
All Kinds Of Eccentric
And Unusual Friends

42:07.112 --> 42:10.042
That Now We See The Photos Of
And It Looks Really Strange.

42:10.042 --> 42:11.102
He's Hanging Out
With Liza Minnelli.

42:11.102 --> 42:13.122
Hi, Sweetheart.

42:13.122 --> 42:14.142
Are You Just
Hanging Out In New York?

42:14.142 --> 42:16.142
Yes, Studio 54.
[Chuckles]

42:16.142 --> 42:18.062
-Come Here A Lot?
-Oh, God, Yes.

42:18.062 --> 42:20.172
-Why?
-Because I Like
The Atmosphere Of Studio 54.

42:20.172 --> 42:23.132
I've Been To
A Lot Of Discotheques,
And I Don't Like Them.

42:23.132 --> 42:24.132
Interviewer: What's
The Difference?

42:24.132 --> 42:26.192
Michael: I Don't Know.
The Feeling.

42:26.192 --> 42:29.152
I Mean, The Excitement
Of The Props Coming Down,
And The Balcony,

42:29.152 --> 42:31.152
It's Just Exciting, Honestly.

42:31.152 --> 42:36.142
I'm Certain
That His Experience
In Going To Studio 54,

42:36.142 --> 42:38.112
During The Filming Of The Wiz,

42:38.112 --> 42:43.162
Played A Big Part
In Where He Wanted
This Album Played.

42:43.162 --> 42:46.042
And It Doesn't Mean
That He Wanted To
Make A Disco Record.

42:46.042 --> 42:48.202
He Is A Dancer.
He's A Marvelous Dancer.

42:48.202 --> 42:50.252
He's An Influential,
Innovative Dancer.

42:50.252 --> 42:53.112
-Interviewer: But Why Do You
Dance For Fun?
-[Music Playing]

42:53.112 --> 42:56.062
Because You're
Just Being Free Then.

42:56.062 --> 42:58.112
-Most Of The Time,
It's Set Choreography
-[Bell Ringing]

42:58.112 --> 42:59.162
When We're On Stage,

42:59.162 --> 43:01.082
It's Stuff You Have
To Do Every Night.

43:01.082 --> 43:02.202
When You Dance Here,
You're Just Free,

43:02.202 --> 43:05.042
You Dance With
Whoever You Want To.

43:05.042 --> 43:07.072
You Just Go Wild.

43:07.072 --> 43:09.222
Interviewer:
What About The Craziness?
It Gets Crazy And Wild...

43:09.222 --> 43:12.042
Michael: No, It Doesn't. No.

43:12.042 --> 43:16.112
Not Only Is It Fun To Dance,
It's Fun To Look
At Other People.

43:16.112 --> 43:18.042
You Walk Around,
And You See All
Kinds Of Things.

43:18.042 --> 43:21.252
Like, Darth Vader Was
Here The Other Night.
It Was Incredible.

43:21.252 --> 43:25.162
I'm Sure He Was
Making These Observations

43:25.162 --> 43:27.072
Of What Was
Going On Around Him.

43:27.072 --> 43:29.122
He Was, Kind Of,
Self-Conscious About Himself,

43:29.122 --> 43:30.222
And Kind Of Shy.

43:30.222 --> 43:32.242
So He Wasn't Trying To Be
Around All Of The Wildness,

43:32.242 --> 43:34.102
All Of The Freakness,
You Know What I'm Saying?

43:34.102 --> 43:37.112
He Would Go In The Dj Booth
And Just Watched People,

43:37.112 --> 43:40.232
And Make These Mental Notes,
And I'm Sure,
Musical Notes, Also.

43:40.232 --> 43:42.202
King: And I Think All Of That
Shows Up On Off The Wall,

43:42.202 --> 43:43.252
Because It's
Certainly One Of The Most

43:43.252 --> 43:45.162
Sensual Albums
He Ever Released.

43:45.162 --> 43:48.132
It Contains A Sort Of
Exuberance And Sexuality.

43:48.132 --> 43:50.222
It's Where You Come
When You Want To Escape.

43:50.222 --> 43:52.222
It's Really Escapism.

43:52.222 --> 43:55.202
Michael: When We Left Motown,

43:55.202 --> 43:57.102
A Certain Amount Of Albums
For The Jacksons,

43:57.102 --> 43:59.182
And A Certain Amount
For Me, As A Solo Artist.

43:59.182 --> 44:01.182
He's Coming Out As
An Autonomous Figure,

44:01.182 --> 44:04.102
Separate From His Father,
Separate From His Brothers,

44:04.102 --> 44:06.132
And Really Establishing
Himself As A Solo Act.

44:06.132 --> 44:08.082
[People Talking Indistinctly]

44:21.142 --> 44:25.072
I Mean, There Was
Some Speculation.
Would Quincy Be The Right Guy?

44:25.072 --> 44:27.092
He's A Jazz Guy,
Would He Be...

44:27.092 --> 44:30.142
They Didn't Think
That He Could Make
A Contemporary Hit Record

44:30.142 --> 44:32.182
That Everybody
In The Whole World Would Like.

44:32.182 --> 44:34.102
I Don't Think
That It's Possible

44:34.102 --> 44:37.202
To Sit Down And Try To
Intellectualize And Theorize

44:37.202 --> 44:39.042
About How You
Can Make A Record

44:39.042 --> 44:42.152
That Can Appeal To Many,
Many People.

44:42.152 --> 44:43.232
With The People
In This Room...

44:43.232 --> 44:45.172
It's Very Difficult
To Try To Make A Record

44:45.172 --> 44:46.252
That Everybody In
This Room Would Like.

44:46.252 --> 44:49.232
The Label Had Other Ideas
About Who He Should Go With.

44:49.232 --> 44:52.062
They Wanted Maurice White,
He Was One Of The People,

44:52.062 --> 44:54.252
And They Also Wanted
Gamble And Huff
To Work With Him.

44:54.252 --> 44:57.202
Michael Came Back All
Teary-Eyed One Day And Said,

44:57.202 --> 45:01.052
"The People At Epic
Don't Want To Use You.

45:01.052 --> 45:03.262
"They Said You're Too Jazzy,
You Don't Understand
This Kind Of Music."

45:03.262 --> 45:05.082
But They Don't Know.

45:05.082 --> 45:06.182
These Guys, They Don't Know.

45:06.182 --> 45:09.222
They're A&AMP;R Men,
They Don't Know.

45:09.222 --> 45:11.252
Thank God He Went Back,

45:11.252 --> 45:15.112
With Freddy Demann
And Ron Weisner,

45:15.112 --> 45:17.092
And They Fought, And
They Said, "He's Doing It."

45:17.092 --> 45:19.142
Quincy Called Me
One Day And Said,

45:19.142 --> 45:23.082
"We're Going To Do
Michael Jackson's Album,

45:23.082 --> 45:25.092
"His First Solo Album."

45:25.092 --> 45:29.162
And I Thought To Myself,
"Holy Cow, I Better
Get Serious."

45:29.162 --> 45:33.152
'Cause I Don't Get Those Kind
Of Calls Very Often.

45:33.152 --> 45:36.042
When You Discover Off The Wall
For The First Time,

45:36.042 --> 45:37.272
Forget All The Music
For A Second,

45:37.272 --> 45:41.082
Let's Just Talk About
The Sonics, The Sound Of It.

45:41.082 --> 45:43.172
The Sonic Of
That Album Stands Up

45:43.172 --> 45:46.102
Against Any Album
Right Now. Period.

45:46.102 --> 45:48.062
Because It's Raw.

45:48.062 --> 45:52.072
It Was Before Drum Machines,
Before Heavy
Computer Programing.

45:52.072 --> 45:56.042
Making An Album Is
Totally Different Today
Than What It Was.

45:56.042 --> 45:58.062
Because When We Made Those
Albums, Back In The Day,

45:58.062 --> 46:00.062
We Had Live Musicians,
Live Drummer.

46:00.062 --> 46:02.212
That Way, You Get Magic.
You Get A Little Bit Of Magic,

46:02.212 --> 46:05.232
And If Somebody's Playing
Just A Little Bit Under
Or Something Like That,

46:05.232 --> 46:07.222
That's All Part Of
Making A Record Breathe.

46:07.222 --> 46:09.162
That's The Pulse.

46:09.162 --> 46:11.102
-Yeah, It's The Pulse.
-Mmm-Hmm.

46:11.102 --> 46:12.212
But Today,
Everything Is Right On.

46:12.212 --> 46:14.122
-Today...
-'Cause They Quantize
Every Damn Thing.

46:14.122 --> 46:15.262
-Everything Is Right On Today.
-[Laughs]

46:15.262 --> 46:18.202
These Were, Like, Living,
Breathing Recordings

46:18.202 --> 46:21.112
That Were For The Dance Floor.

46:21.112 --> 46:23.072
Machines Are Great,

46:23.072 --> 46:26.112
But Incredible Musicians,
I Feel Like,
Will Beat It Everytime.

46:26.112 --> 46:29.122
I'm Always
Telling Engineers, Like,
"You Better Study And Listen.

46:29.122 --> 46:31.252
"If They Were Able To
Accomplish That Type

46:31.252 --> 46:34.252
"Of Fullness And
That Type Of Sound,

46:34.252 --> 46:36.082
"They Were Able To Do
That Then, You Better

46:36.082 --> 46:37.272
"Be Able To Do
Something Great Now,

46:37.272 --> 46:39.142
-"Or You're Fired."
-[Interviewer Chuckles]

46:39.142 --> 46:42.052
What Quincy Has,
Is An Extraordinary History.

46:42.052 --> 46:43.262
He's Leading
The Band Behind Count Basie.

46:43.262 --> 46:45.142
Jones: Working With
Frank Sinatra...

46:45.142 --> 46:47.062
Harry Weinger:
Sammy Davis Jr....

46:47.062 --> 46:47.242
-Pawnbroker.
-Jones: In The Heat
Of The Night,

46:47.242 --> 46:49.102
Sanford And Son...

46:49.102 --> 46:51.232
He Studied In France
Under A Great Orchestration.

46:51.232 --> 46:55.222
Nadia Boulanger,
Who Taught Ravel.

46:55.222 --> 46:57.262
Michael: He's Unlimited
Musically, He Can...

46:57.262 --> 47:00.062
God, You Want Anything,
He Can Do It.

47:00.062 --> 47:05.182
Jazz, Folk, Pop, Classical,
Soul, Gospel, Anything.

47:05.182 --> 47:09.112
Michael Wrote Three Songs
On The Off The Wall Album,

47:09.112 --> 47:10.262
Don't Stop 'Til
You Get Enough,

47:10.262 --> 47:13.212
Workin' Day And Night,
And Get On The Floor.

47:13.212 --> 47:15.272
He Wanted The Freedom
To Develop As An Artist,

47:15.272 --> 47:18.262
And Writing These Three Songs
Was Very Important To Him.

47:18.262 --> 47:20.202
♪ Don't Stop
'Til You Get Enough ♪

47:20.202 --> 47:22.262
♪ Keep On With Your Heart,

47:26.202 --> 47:27.222

47:27.222 --> 47:30.072
The Demos Are
Kind Of A Revelation,

47:30.072 --> 47:35.152
In That They Really Illuminate
Michael's Abilities
As A Songwriter,

47:35.152 --> 47:38.102
And Show How Developed
His Songs Were

47:38.102 --> 47:40.112
When He Brought
Them To Quincy Jones.

47:40.112 --> 47:43.262
You Really See Michael's
Rhythmic Sophistication.

47:43.262 --> 47:47.062
[Mimicking Instruments]
[Snapping Fingers]

47:47.062 --> 47:48.072
That's What Did It.

47:48.072 --> 47:50.262
[Mimicking Instruments]

47:50.262 --> 47:53.152
That's The Phrase That Pays.
That's The Hook Right There.

47:53.152 --> 47:55.122
Michael Ain't Got
To Say A Word Yet.

47:55.122 --> 47:57.182
They Could Play That Baseline,

47:57.182 --> 48:01.222
And They Could Run It
Non-Stop, And We're Good.

48:01.222 --> 48:04.112
The Opening Bars Of
That Record Is Just Like,

01:00:37.232 --> 01:00:39.202
"Darn It!
I Should've Done This!
I Should've..."

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:41.082
It's Number One On The Charts,

01:00:41.082 --> 01:00:43.092
You're Still Screaming About
What You Should've Done.

01:00:43.092 --> 01:00:45.152
It's Evident When You
See Somebody's Work.

01:00:45.152 --> 01:00:48.272
You Can See The Details,
And If They Actually,
Truly Love What They Do,

01:00:48.272 --> 01:00:50.262
If They Really Do Pay
Attention To The Craft.

01:00:50.262 --> 01:00:52.182
Perfection Was
The Name Of The Game.

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:56.042
It Was About
The Content Of What You Do,

01:00:56.042 --> 01:00:59.222
The Quality, The Heart,
The Soul, The Love.

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:01.172
I Think This Generation
Has Just Become...

01:01:01.172 --> 01:01:03.062
The Perception's
Become Skewed.

01:01:03.062 --> 01:01:06.082
The Love For The Craft
Becomes Secondary

01:01:06.082 --> 01:01:09.062
To The Love Of
Fame And Notoriety.

01:01:09.062 --> 01:01:11.192
My Generation,
The Jordan Generation,

01:01:11.192 --> 01:01:14.252
Bird, Magic,
You Know, Michael Jackson,

01:01:14.252 --> 01:01:17.242
They Focused On
What They Loved To Do.

01:01:17.242 --> 01:01:21.082
One Of The Hidden Gems
Is Get On The Floor,

01:01:21.082 --> 01:01:25.062
Which Was Co-Penned
By Louis Johnson
From Brothers Johnson,

01:01:25.062 --> 01:01:26.272
And Co-Written With Michael.

01:01:26.272 --> 01:01:29.232
I Don't Know If
Everybody Knows This,
But You're Also A Composer.

01:01:29.232 --> 01:01:33.092
One Of My Favorites
Was Michael Jackson's
Get On The Floor And Dance.

01:01:33.092 --> 01:01:37.052
Originally, That Song Was
Created By The Bass,
I Just Had That Groove.

Or Sometimes,
If You Were Really Tacky,

01:02:08.122 --> 01:02:11.052

01:02:14.082 --> 01:02:15.202

Going Home With Somebody.

01:02:54.092 --> 01:02:56.092
Questlove:
You Basically Have Five Songs,

01:02:56.092 --> 01:02:59.082

Songs On Side One,

My Favorite Record
On Off The Wall...

01:03:05.042 --> 01:03:08.152
I Like Off The Wall,
That's One Of My
Favorite Records.

01:03:08.152 --> 01:03:14.092
I Took A Chance With
A Composer, I Had Loved
His Work For A Long Time.

01:03:14.092 --> 01:03:17.192
And I Could Never Figure Out
How He Could Be From
Grimsby, England,

01:03:17.192 --> 01:03:21.132
Living In Worms, Germany,
And Understand
Ain't No Half Steppin'

01:03:21.132 --> 01:03:24.062
And, You Know, All Of
Those Different Terms
That He Was Writing.

01:03:24.062 --> 01:03:25.272
It Was Just Incredible Talent.

01:03:25.272 --> 01:03:28.072
He Ended Up In Germany
And Being Turned
Onto Soul Music

01:03:28.072 --> 01:03:30.222
By A Bunch Of
The Black Army People
That Were There.

01:03:30.222 --> 01:03:32.182
-Man: Black American Soldiers?
-Black American Soldiers.

01:03:32.182 --> 01:03:35.182
And Going, "Wow,
This Is A Lot More Interesting
Than What I'm Doing,

01:03:35.182 --> 01:03:37.102
"And Girls Come
To These Shows."

01:03:37.102 --> 01:03:40.122
In Early Heatwave,
You Can Hear

01:03:40.122 --> 01:03:42.222
Those Influences In Songs
He Wrote For Michael.

01:03:42.222 --> 01:03:45.042
I Mean, It's Just
A Natural Progression.

01:03:45.042 --> 01:03:48.062
And We Recorded
Burn This Disco Out,

01:03:48.062 --> 01:03:51.092

And Rock With You.

01:03:51.092 --> 01:03:52.242

Rod Temperton Did Good.

01:03:55.182 --> 01:04:02.242
Off The Wall Is An Example
Of Him Bringing That Slightly
Proggy-Fusion Aspect To It.

01:04:02.242 --> 01:04:04.272
It's A Really
Unconventional Start
For A Disco Record,

01:04:04.272 --> 01:04:08.042
Especially, Like,
The Title Track Of An Album.

01:04:08.042 --> 01:04:10.062
It Starts On The Off-Beat,
It Starts On The Two,

01:04:10.062 --> 01:04:13.272
It Has That Weird Vocal Thing
In The Background,
It's Totally Proggy.

01:04:13.272 --> 01:04:16.102

Kind Of Ghoulish Voices,

You'd Say To Them
To Make Them Go Away.

Tom Bahler:
I Wrote She's Out Of My Life

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:34.182
As A Result Of
Being Very Much In Love
With A Wonderful Young Woman.

01:06:34.182 --> 01:06:38.162
You Ever Get So Upset
That You're Speaking
To Yourself Out Loud?

01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:42.192
Well, I Was. I Was In The Car
On The Pasadena Freeway,
And I'm Saying,

01:06:42.192 --> 01:06:46.192
"Man, She Was There For You,
She Loved You,
She Wanted To Marry You.

01:06:46.192 --> 01:06:50.122
"You're The One Who Said No.
Face It,
She's Out Of Your Life."

01:06:50.122 --> 01:06:52.242
Saturday Morning,
The Phone Rings And It's Q,

01:06:52.242 --> 01:06:54.222
And He Says,
"Hey, Man, You Been Writing?"

01:06:54.222 --> 01:06:58.112
And I Played The Song,
And It's Ringing Out,
And He Said, "Play It Again."

01:06:58.112 --> 01:07:01.072
I Played It Again.
Played It Eight
Times In A Row.

01:07:01.072 --> 01:07:03.112
And At The End Of It,
He Said, "What're You
Gonna Do With It?"

01:07:03.112 --> 01:07:05.232
And I Said,
"Well, I Made A Deal
With Snuffy Yesterday.

01:07:05.232 --> 01:07:08.042
"He's Gonna Do
It With Sinatra."

01:07:08.042 --> 01:07:12.062
And He Says This Q-Ism,
"Sinatra Will Do It Anyway."

01:07:12.062 --> 01:07:14.062
And I Said, "Okay, Q,
Who Do You Wanna Do It With?"

01:07:14.062 --> 01:07:15.192
He Said,
"I Haven't Got A Clue."

01:07:15.192 --> 01:07:18.052
Then He Said,
"Man, If You'll Trust Me,

01:07:18.052 --> 01:07:19.202
"I Promise You

01:07:21.042 --> 01:07:24.082
"An Unforgettable
Recording Of This Song."

01:07:25.272 --> 01:07:28.142
And We Sat On It
For Almost Two Years, Spike.

01:07:28.142 --> 01:07:32.092
To Write A Great Ballad,
First Of All, Lyrically,
The Content Has To Connect.

01:07:32.092 --> 01:07:36.082
And, To Me, Part Of
What Makes A Song Connect

01:07:36.082 --> 01:07:41.042
Is That It's Personal,
But It's Also Universal.

01:07:41.042 --> 01:07:45.092
Michael Jackson, Yes,
He's A Great Entertainer,
He Was A Great Dancer,

01:07:45.092 --> 01:07:47.242
But He Was Also
A Great Singer.

01:07:47.242 --> 01:07:50.062
Not A Good Singer,
But A Great Singer.

01:07:50.062 --> 01:07:53.052

01:12:08.192 --> 01:12:12.252
He Would've Had Kleenex,
Like, Sponsor The Tour.
[Laughing]

01:12:12.252 --> 01:12:16.072
You Had People
Talking About, "Well,
What Was He Crying About?

01:12:16.072 --> 01:12:19.082
"Who Was He Talking About?
Is He Talking About
Brooke Shields?

01:12:19.082 --> 01:12:20.222
"What Girl Is
He Talking About?

01:12:20.222 --> 01:12:22.152
"Is He Still Talking
About Ben, That Rat?"

01:12:22.152 --> 01:12:25.222
We'd Seen Him Out Publicly
With Stephanie Mills,

01:12:25.222 --> 01:12:27.132
We'd Seen Him Out
With Tatum O'neal,

01:12:27.132 --> 01:12:29.232
With Maureen Mccormick
From The Brady Bunch.

01:12:29.232 --> 01:12:31.092
Girls Would Get
Together And Like,

01:12:31.092 --> 01:12:32.272
"I Wonder Who
He's Talking About."

01:12:32.272 --> 01:12:34.152
You Know What I Mean?

01:12:34.152 --> 01:12:35.262
And You Would Look At The
Tiger Beat Magazine

01:12:35.262 --> 01:12:37.262
To Look For
The Gossip And Everything.

01:12:37.262 --> 01:12:41.072
"Who Made Michael Cry?"
That's How We Took It.

01:12:41.072 --> 01:12:42.112
Not That I Made Michael Cry,

01:12:42.112 --> 01:12:44.132
'Cause I Would
Never Make Michael Cry.

01:12:44.132 --> 01:12:50.072
She's Out Of My Life
Is, In My Opinion,

01:12:50.072 --> 01:12:52.252
One Of The Two Songs
On Off The Wall

01:12:52.252 --> 01:12:55.192
That There's Nothing On
Thriller That Tops It.

01:12:55.192 --> 01:12:57.252
Quiet Storm Was
Huge In The 1970s,

01:12:57.252 --> 01:13:00.192
Which Was A Kind Of
Radio Format Of Black Music

01:13:00.192 --> 01:13:02.272
That Celebrated
Intimacy And Sensuality,

01:13:02.272 --> 01:13:04.272
And Ambient Softness
And Quiet, Too.

01:13:04.272 --> 01:13:07.102
I Can't Help It Was
Really The Quiet Storm
Demographic, Right.

01:13:07.102 --> 01:13:10.062
It Was Really
The Kind Of Late-Night,
Boudoir Romance Thing.

01:13:10.062 --> 01:13:13.092
It's The First Time That
You Really Hear Michael,

01:13:13.092 --> 01:13:16.082
To Me, Sounding Like An Adult,

01:13:16.082 --> 01:13:21.162
And Sounding Outside
Of His R&AMP;B Thing, It's Jazzy.

01:13:21.162 --> 01:13:23.142
Susaye Greene Had
Started Working On It.

01:13:23.142 --> 01:13:26.062
She Was In The Supremes,
But Also Sung With Stevie.

01:13:26.062 --> 01:13:28.252
It Could've Fit On
Songs In The Key
Of Life, Really.

01:13:28.252 --> 01:13:31.172
That Was Supposed To Be
One Of The Songs On Songs
In The Key Of Life.

01:13:31.172 --> 01:13:32.212
-[Gasps]
-Man: Ooh.

01:13:32.212 --> 01:13:33.232
See, I Didn't Know That.

01:13:33.232 --> 01:13:36.272
He Had The... [Singing]

01:13:36.272 --> 01:13:38.102
The Hook.

01:13:38.102 --> 01:13:39.202
I Think She Wrote
A Lot Of The Lyric

01:13:39.202 --> 01:13:41.232
When We Actually
Were In The Studio
Messing Around With It.

01:13:41.232 --> 01:13:42.202
That's Right.

01:13:47.232 --> 01:13:49.192
[Humming]

01:14:01.092 --> 01:14:02.152
I Can't Help It
Is My Favorite.

01:14:02.152 --> 01:14:04.132
Stevie Overdid It
With That Song.

01:14:04.132 --> 01:14:06.172
The Nature Of The Chords
Are Very Nocturnal.

01:14:06.172 --> 01:14:09.182
You Know, It Doesn't Sound
Like A Sunny Day To Me.

01:14:09.182 --> 01:14:14.212
It Sounds Like, You Know,
Beautiful Paradise Evening,
You Know.

01:14:14.212 --> 01:14:17.172
Somewhere Untainted
By The Humans, You Know.

01:14:17.172 --> 01:14:19.242
Mystical World,

01:14:19.242 --> 01:14:22.092
You Know, Unicorns
Walking Past And Shit.

01:14:22.092 --> 01:14:27.122
My Sister, Renee, Had Been
Hearing Me Play This Cassette.

01:14:27.122 --> 01:14:30.222
She And Michael Were Friends,
And She Took It Over

01:14:30.222 --> 01:14:34.062
To Let Michael Hear It,
And I Think It Was Great
That He Did It.

01:14:34.062 --> 01:14:36.062
I Mean, Really,
He Did An Incredible Job.

01:14:36.062 --> 01:14:37.192
The Melodies Are
Very Seductive.

01:14:37.192 --> 01:14:41.082
They Carry Some Of Those
Signature Stevie Lines,

01:14:41.082 --> 01:14:43.142
But Also There's
Signature Stevie Chords.

01:14:43.142 --> 01:14:45.102
I Really Believed
In The Album.

01:14:45.102 --> 01:14:47.142
First Of All,
I Believed In Michael Jackson.

01:14:47.142 --> 01:14:49.162
Stevie Wonder,
I Love Stevie Wonder.

01:14:49.162 --> 01:14:52.102
Being With Stevie Wonder,
Being In His Sessions,

01:14:52.102 --> 01:14:56.062
Just Sitting In And Learning
Just Was Incredible.

01:14:56.062 --> 01:14:57.152
You Could Put On
I Can't Help It Right Now

01:14:57.152 --> 01:14:59.142
And I'd Still Find Something
That I Haven't Heard

01:14:59.142 --> 01:15:00.262
Or It Will Remind Me
Of Something,

01:15:00.262 --> 01:15:04.232
Or The Warmth Of The Bass Line
Would Just Kind
Of Wash Over You.

01:15:04.232 --> 01:15:07.152
It's Just Like...
You Don't Get
Sick Of That Music.

01:15:07.152 --> 01:15:12.152
I Did A Record, Back In 1977.

01:15:12.152 --> 01:15:16.092
We Did
It's The Falling In Love,
We Co-Wrote It Together.

01:15:16.092 --> 01:15:17.272
-And I Know You Played On It.
-Yeah.

01:15:17.272 --> 01:15:20.222
I Think My Record
Served As A Nice Demo.

01:15:20.222 --> 01:15:22.192
David: Demo.

01:15:22.192 --> 01:15:26.182
Questlove:
Patti Austin Was A Singer
In The Quincy Jones Arsenal.

01:15:26.182 --> 01:15:29.092
The Very First Time That
I Heard Patti Austin's Voice

01:15:29.092 --> 01:15:31.162
Was It's The Falling In Love.

01:15:31.162 --> 01:15:33.192
The Thing That
Really Steeps A Record

01:15:33.192 --> 01:15:35.242
In Its Era And That
Could Make It Sound Dated

01:15:35.242 --> 01:15:39.222
Is Relying Heavily
On Very Specific
Technology Of The Time.

01:15:39.222 --> 01:15:43.052
And In The '80s,
It Was Very Much
About Gated Reverbs,

01:15:43.052 --> 01:15:46.192
And In The Late '70s,
You Had These Big,
Massive Disco Claps.

01:15:46.192 --> 01:15:50.202
This Album Was, Perhaps,
Maybe One False Step Away

01:15:50.202 --> 01:15:52.222
From Being A Very
Dated Disco Record.

01:15:52.222 --> 01:15:55.142
It Didn't Have Any Of Those
Tricks Or Gimmicks.

01:15:55.142 --> 01:15:58.132
Even Though It Was
Immaculately Arranged,

01:15:58.132 --> 01:15:59.212
And All The Percussive Parts,

01:15:59.212 --> 01:16:01.082
And All The Way
The Parts Worked Together,

01:16:01.082 --> 01:16:03.272
There's Nothing Other
Than A Bunch Of Dudes

01:16:03.272 --> 01:16:06.082
Playing The Shit Out
Of A Song In A Room.

01:16:06.082 --> 01:16:07.152
That Will Never Date.

01:16:07.152 --> 01:16:10.142
In A Lot Of Ways,
Off The Wall Is Probably

01:16:10.142 --> 01:16:15.042
The Culmination
Of Classic Disco.

01:16:15.042 --> 01:16:17.202
It Came Out In August 1979,

01:16:17.202 --> 01:16:19.152
The "Disco Sucks"

01:16:19.152 --> 01:16:22.122
Movement Started
Just A Month Before, In July,

01:16:22.122 --> 01:16:25.202
When A Shock Dj,
Steve Dahl, In Chicago,

01:16:25.202 --> 01:16:27.222
Gathered A Lot
Of People Together

01:16:27.222 --> 01:16:30.212
At Comiskey Park In Chicago
To Burn Disco Records

01:16:30.212 --> 01:16:33.102
Which Is A Really,
I Think, Implicitly Racist

01:16:33.102 --> 01:16:35.192
And Kind Of
Homophobic Movement.

01:16:35.192 --> 01:16:38.212
People Wanted To Shift
The Dial Of Popular Music

01:16:38.212 --> 01:16:41.202
Back To Where They
Felt Comfortable,

01:16:41.202 --> 01:16:45.092
Which Was Not Black,
Not Gay, Not Latino.

01:16:45.092 --> 01:16:47.212
Burn This Disco Out Actually
Might've Been An Apt Title

01:16:47.212 --> 01:16:51.152
Because It Was Coming
Literally At The End
Of The Disco Era.

01:16:51.152 --> 01:16:56.092
Just At The Edge Of
Being A Disco Record,
But Moving The Genre Forward.

01:16:56.092 --> 01:16:59.212
Far From One Of
The Disco Factory Music

01:16:59.212 --> 01:17:02.142
That Was Just
Churning Out Factory Beats.

01:17:02.142 --> 01:17:04.252
You Can Feel That
Kind Of Visceral Energy.

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:08.062
I Mean, Off The Wall Really Is
Like Lightning In A Bottle.

01:17:08.062 --> 01:17:11.172
I Mean, You Really
Capture Michael Jackson
At 20 Years Old

01:17:11.172 --> 01:17:14.062
With All Of That Excitement
And Energy And Passion.

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:16.222
That Still Really
Comes Through On That Record.

01:17:16.222 --> 01:17:20.142
This Is The Very Last 8-Track
That My Parents Brought Me

01:17:20.142 --> 01:17:22.172
Before I Stopped
Buying 8-Tracks.

01:17:22.172 --> 01:17:28.092
I Remember
Off The Wall Coming Out
Second Week Of August In 1979.

01:17:28.092 --> 01:17:30.222
Departure Album
Is Sort Of An Album

01:17:30.222 --> 01:17:33.072
That Is In A Person's
Canon In Their Career,

01:17:33.072 --> 01:17:37.172
Of Which They Make
A 180 Turn From What They
Were Known From.

01:17:37.172 --> 01:17:39.182
He Was No Longer
The Teenybopper Act,

01:17:39.182 --> 01:17:41.182
He Was No Longer
The Socially Shy,

01:17:41.182 --> 01:17:43.212
Awkward,
Maladjusted Guy With Acne.

01:17:43.212 --> 01:17:46.272
He Was Suddenly
Exuberant, Confident.

01:17:46.272 --> 01:17:50.082
You Look At The Album
Cover Of Off The Wall,
It's Like His Prom Picture.

01:17:50.082 --> 01:17:53.222
He's In A Suit And Tie In
The Kind Of Frank Sinatra,
Sammy Davis Mold.

01:17:53.222 --> 01:17:55.042
Now, He's This
Free-Wheeling Playboy

01:17:55.042 --> 01:17:57.132
That You Can Imagine Out
On The Streets Of New York.

01:17:57.132 --> 01:17:59.082
Again, Life-Changing.

01:17:59.082 --> 01:18:02.242
I Think Sophisticated,
I Think Glamour,

01:18:02.242 --> 01:18:04.212
I Think Provocateur,

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:08.112
I Think Everything
That I Wanted To Be.

01:18:08.112 --> 01:18:10.212
Yeah, I'm Interested
In Promotion.

01:18:10.212 --> 01:18:13.192
I Wanna Do Things That's
Never Been Done Before.

01:18:13.192 --> 01:18:17.112
If It Weren't For Promotion,
Who Would Know
About The Jackson 5?

01:18:17.112 --> 01:18:19.272
Who Would Know That We Exist?

01:18:19.272 --> 01:18:23.162
I Wouldn't Be Able
To Translate My Music
To Different Countries,

01:18:23.162 --> 01:18:29.072
Africa, Japan,
New Zealand, Scotland,
All The Way To Australia.

01:18:29.072 --> 01:18:31.102
Jones: The Universal Core
In Music, I Think,

01:18:31.102 --> 01:18:33.082
Transcends Even What
A Crossover's About.

01:18:33.082 --> 01:18:37.042
We View A Crossover
As Being, You Know,
Black And White Markets,

01:18:37.042 --> 01:18:39.072
Which We've Been
Faced With For Years,

01:18:39.072 --> 01:18:41.092
But I Think
Michael's Thing Went
Even Past That, You Know.

01:18:41.092 --> 01:18:45.212
You Get Into Argentina
And Israel And Spain
And Scandinavia And Australia.

01:18:45.212 --> 01:18:48.102
I Tell People
Fashion And Music
Is A Universal Language.

01:18:48.102 --> 01:18:51.232
Wherever You Go, You're Gonna
Hear The Same Songs
In Certain Countries.

01:18:51.232 --> 01:18:54.042
And When People
Come Together For Those Songs,

01:18:54.042 --> 01:18:55.242
They're All Happy,
They're All At Peace.

01:18:55.242 --> 01:18:57.142
'Cause A Lot Of People
Wouldn't Even Speak English,

01:18:57.142 --> 01:18:58.252
When We Traveled The Globe,

01:18:58.252 --> 01:19:00.232
But They Know The Song,
They Know The Music

01:19:00.232 --> 01:19:02.152
And They Learned
The Lyrics Somehow.

01:19:02.152 --> 01:19:04.262
And That's Just So Wonderful

01:19:04.262 --> 01:19:07.252
How You Can
Bring People Together
Just Through Your Music.

01:19:07.252 --> 01:19:10.132
Michael Jackson
Can Come Out On Stage
And Not Say Anything,

01:19:10.132 --> 01:19:12.182
And You Know That He Cared.

01:19:12.182 --> 01:19:15.122
Hundred Thousand People In
An Olympic Stadium Feel That
He's Right There For Them.

01:19:15.122 --> 01:19:19.242
Everyone Thinks, You Know,
Like They've Had Such A
Personal Connection With Him,

01:19:19.242 --> 01:19:22.092
But That's How Great He Was.

01:19:22.092 --> 01:19:23.252
He Made You Feel Like That.

01:19:23.252 --> 01:19:26.062
Michael Just Inspired Me
To Be A Better Person.

01:19:26.062 --> 01:19:29.122
I Actually Do Believe That
The Blessing That The Lord
Gave This Family,

01:19:29.122 --> 01:19:30.242
The Musical Blessing,

01:19:30.242 --> 01:19:33.062
The True Mission Behind
All Of That, I Believe,

01:19:33.062 --> 01:19:35.252
Is To Unify The World Together
Through Your Music As One.

01:19:35.252 --> 01:19:38.132
And It's About
Changing The World

01:19:38.132 --> 01:19:41.072
For A Better Place For
Our Kids To Grow Up In.

01:19:41.072 --> 01:19:42.172
He Had Seen What Had Happened

01:19:42.172 --> 01:19:46.092
To Artists Like James Brown,
Little Richard, Jackie Wilson.

01:19:46.092 --> 01:19:49.072
Sometimes, The Industry
Wasn't Fair To Black Artists.

01:19:49.072 --> 01:19:51.062
I Remember Fighting
In The Meeting,
You Know, Like,

01:19:51.062 --> 01:19:54.062
"How Come Michael's
Not On The Cover Of
People Magazine?"

01:19:54.062 --> 01:19:56.092
"How Come He's Not
On The Cover Of Us?"

01:19:56.092 --> 01:19:59.212
Pop Radio Stations
Didn't Want To Play
Off The Wall In The Beginning.

01:19:59.212 --> 01:20:01.092
Publicity Lady Would Tell Me,

01:20:01.092 --> 01:20:03.172
"Well, If A Black Person
Is Put On The Cover

01:20:03.172 --> 01:20:05.202
"Of These Magazines,
They Won't Sell."

01:20:05.202 --> 01:20:08.262
Michael Jackson Is A Viable
Artist All By Himself,

01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:11.062
And If They Gave
Him The Opportunity,

01:20:11.062 --> 01:20:13.132
He Could Win
The Radio Stations Over.

01:20:13.132 --> 01:20:14.182
And He Did.

01:20:14.182 --> 01:20:16.122
'Cause He Just
Made Us Feel Like

01:20:16.122 --> 01:20:19.122
Where We Are Is
Where We Always Were,
And We Weren't.

01:20:19.122 --> 01:20:23.142
There Are Kids That Were Born
When Obama Was In Office.

01:20:23.142 --> 01:20:26.062
So, They Don't Understand
A World Where There Was
A White President.

01:20:26.062 --> 01:20:27.222
They Don't Even Know
What That Feels Like.

01:20:27.222 --> 01:20:32.082
I Didn't Know
What It Felt Like
To Not Have Black Pop Artists

01:20:32.082 --> 01:20:36.182
Because He Made
Us Feel And Believe
That That Was Just A Norm.

01:20:36.182 --> 01:20:40.272
He Took Black Music To A Place
Where It Became Human Music.

01:20:40.272 --> 01:20:44.072
Michael: Music Has No Color,
And It Shouldn't Have Color.

01:20:44.072 --> 01:20:45.272
And I Don't Believe In That.

01:20:45.272 --> 01:20:48.262
What I Do, I Don't Want It
Labelled Black Or White.

01:20:48.262 --> 01:20:51.062
I Want It Labelled As Music.

01:20:51.062 --> 01:20:56.082
It Was A Simpler Time,
And Radio Had Everything
To Do With It.

01:20:56.082 --> 01:20:59.182
Hey, Let's Go Out
With Some Up-Tempo First,

01:20:59.182 --> 01:21:00.262
Get Ourselves Positioned,

01:21:00.262 --> 01:21:02.212
Bang, And We'll Come
In With That Ballad,

01:21:02.212 --> 01:21:06.122
And, You Know, You Go Gold,
You Go Platinum.

01:21:06.122 --> 01:21:09.132
Four Singles In
The Top 10 And Billboard,

01:21:09.132 --> 01:21:12.062
Not Counting It
Being Number One
On R&AMP;B Radio Stations.

01:21:12.062 --> 01:21:13.242
It Had Never Been Done Before.

01:21:13.242 --> 01:21:16.272
Some People Looked At It
As A Disco Album,

01:21:16.272 --> 01:21:19.052
Which In Retrospect
Is Kind Of Foolish,

01:21:19.052 --> 01:21:23.272
Because It's One Of
The Most Creatively
Influential Albums In History.

01:21:23.272 --> 01:21:28.072
You Look Back At The Awards
For Off The Wall,
They're R&AMP;B Awards.

01:21:28.072 --> 01:21:30.192
The Music Industry Was Still
Very Segregated At The Time.

01:21:30.192 --> 01:21:35.062
And Michael Was Only Nominated
For R&AMP;B Awards And He Won.

01:21:51.162 --> 01:21:54.222
He Thought It Wasn't Fair.
He Thought They Snubbed Him,
It Wasn't Fair.

01:21:54.222 --> 01:21:58.042
He Came And He Told Me,
"Mother, Next Year,

01:21:58.042 --> 01:22:00.072
"They're Gonna Have
To Give It To Me."

01:22:00.072 --> 01:22:02.122
-Man: And That Was Thriller?
-That's Right.

01:22:02.122 --> 01:22:06.062
Off The Wall Really Kind Of
Set The Blueprint For R&AMP;B,

01:22:06.062 --> 01:22:09.132
And I Think Most Artists Today
Acknowledge That.

01:22:09.132 --> 01:22:13.132
It's Hard To Come Up
With Something Fresh
And New All The Time.

01:22:13.132 --> 01:22:15.052
They Go Back And They Say,
"What Was Great?

01:22:15.052 --> 01:22:17.082
"What Was Done
That Was Just Great?"

01:22:17.082 --> 01:22:19.212
And They Find Themselves
Listening To Off The Wall,

01:22:19.212 --> 01:22:22.042
And Then They Take A Little
Piece And They Say,

01:22:22.042 --> 01:22:24.202
"See How He Did This?
We Gotta Do That."

01:22:24.202 --> 01:22:26.252
"See How He Made That Sound?
We Gotta Do That."

01:22:26.252 --> 01:22:28.182
I Do That, So, I Know.

01:22:28.182 --> 01:22:31.092
That Album, You Hear It
In Music All The Time.

01:22:31.092 --> 01:22:33.092
Pharrell To Justin Timberlake.

01:22:33.092 --> 01:22:36.092
My Music Would Not
Be Here If It Weren't
For His Influence,

01:22:36.092 --> 01:22:39.092
Off The Wall
And The Next Album
After That As Well.

01:22:39.092 --> 01:22:41.132
Like, I Wouldn't Have Music.

01:22:41.132 --> 01:22:44.042
I Don't Think There's Any Way
There's Any Other Record That
I Played More Music From,

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:46.062
Like, In The Course
Of 20 Years Of Djing.

01:22:46.062 --> 01:22:51.072
Ten To 15,000 Times,
Like, I Have Released
The Vinyl On Those Songs.

01:22:51.072 --> 01:22:54.052
Off The Wall Is The Album
I Still Play To This Day.

01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:57.082
It's The Album That I Put On
When I Want To Teach My
Daughter How To Dance.

01:22:57.082 --> 01:23:00.142
It Was Soul Music's
Epoch Of Magic Realism.

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:03.132
And When I Say Magic Realism,
I Mean It Was Transformative.

01:23:03.132 --> 01:23:04.272
It Takes You Someplace Else.

01:23:04.272 --> 01:23:08.042
It's So Rich, Musically,
The Arrangements,

01:23:08.042 --> 01:23:09.262
The Singing,
The Background Vocals.

01:23:09.262 --> 01:23:11.212
Michael Taught
Me Melody Is King.

01:23:11.212 --> 01:23:16.182
He Was Like,
"Babies Don't Sing Lyrics,
They Hum Melody."

01:23:16.182 --> 01:23:18.262
A-B-C-D-E-F-G.

01:23:18.262 --> 01:23:21.152
They May Not Know
All The Letters
In The Alphabet,

01:23:21.152 --> 01:23:23.162
But They Know That
Melody To That Song.

01:23:23.162 --> 01:23:27.132
That Was The Way I Saw Music.
I Always Saw Music As
These Little Portals.

01:23:27.132 --> 01:23:29.092
It Was Like, You Listen
To A Song, Okay,

01:23:29.092 --> 01:23:31.082
It's Gonna Take You
Into This Land Every Time.

01:23:31.082 --> 01:23:34.232
In Its First Year Alone,
That Album Sold
Over Six Million Copies.

01:23:34.232 --> 01:23:37.212
It's Been Overshadowed
Because Of The Thriller Album.

01:23:37.212 --> 01:23:40.262
There Would Be No Thriller
Without Off The Wall.
Everybody Knows That.

01:23:40.262 --> 01:23:44.072
When He Went In The Studio
To Make Thriller,
He Was Intent,

01:23:44.072 --> 01:23:47.062
Actually Intent On Making
The Biggest Album In History.

01:23:47.062 --> 01:23:49.062
And The Amazing Thing
Is That He Actually Did.

01:23:49.062 --> 01:23:51.162
Whatever Your Top Game Was,
You Going On Top Of That One.

01:23:51.162 --> 01:23:53.082
That Was His Gift.

01:23:53.082 --> 01:23:57.272
You're Dealing
With A True Artist
Devoted To The Art,

01:23:57.272 --> 01:24:00.042
And Everything Else
Is Secondary.

01:24:00.042 --> 01:24:04.232
I Think It's Very Easy For
People To Get Sidetracked
And Talk About His Complexion,

01:24:04.232 --> 01:24:09.042
They Don't Focus On
What This Man Was,
And How He Was That.

01:24:09.042 --> 01:24:11.172
And How You Can
Learn From That.

01:24:11.172 --> 01:24:14.082
You Approach Things
The Way He Approached Music

01:24:14.082 --> 01:24:17.222
And You Will Be Phenomenal.

01:24:17.222 --> 01:24:22.052
Interviewer: And The Idea Of
Being Separated From Your
Brothers, Does That Hurt?

01:24:22.052 --> 01:24:24.082
No, It Doesn't.

01:24:24.082 --> 01:24:25.232
It...

01:24:25.232 --> 01:24:31.162
There's Other Kinds Of Sounds
And Music That I Love To Do.

01:24:31.162 --> 01:24:34.152
It Hurts What Is Inside Of Me
And It Can't Get Out,

01:24:34.152 --> 01:24:36.162
And It's Hidden
From The World.

01:24:36.162 --> 01:24:40.212
When I Do Those Solo Albums,
Then I'm Doing All
Kinds Of Different Music.

01:24:40.212 --> 01:24:43.252
It's Wonderful. I Feel Like
I'm Accomplishing What
I'm Supposed To Do.

01:24:43.252 --> 01:24:47.052
Interviewer: And You Don't
Feel Guilty Or Worried
About Your Brothers?

01:24:47.052 --> 01:24:50.152
No, 'Cause They Understand.

01:24:50.152 --> 01:24:54.082
Why Hide It? Share It.

01:24:54.082 --> 01:24:56.132
Off The Wall
Will Live Forever.

01:24:56.132 --> 01:25:01.132
That Was 1979,
But This Is Just
The Beginning For That Record.

01:25:01.132 --> 01:25:03.052
It's Just
The Beginning That...

01:25:03.052 --> 01:25:09.262
New People Will Explore
And Discover It Today
And Tomorrow,

01:25:09.262 --> 01:25:13.042
And It'd Be
Something New To Them
Today And Tomorrow.

01:25:13.042 --> 01:25:14.092
It's Just The Beginning.

01:25:14.092 --> 01:25:20.042
He Transcended
Sexual Barriers,
Racial Barriers.

01:25:20.042 --> 01:25:22.202
He Brought Everybody
In With Everybody,

01:25:22.202 --> 01:25:25.212
Old People, Young People,
Gay, Straight.

01:25:25.212 --> 01:25:29.192
I Mean, Wherever You Went,
There Was A Smile.

01:25:29.192 --> 01:25:33.152
But The Beauty Of His Artistry
And What He Has Left Us,

01:25:33.152 --> 01:25:35.132
With So Much Joy,

01:25:35.132 --> 01:25:39.072
And So Much Thankfulness,

01:25:40.222 --> 01:25:43.242
For All That He
Had Given To Me...

01:25:43.242 --> 01:25:45.142
You Know, Given To Everybody,

01:25:45.142 --> 01:25:47.252
But I'm Just Gonna Be
Selfish Here For A Moment,

01:25:47.252 --> 01:25:50.062
What He Gave To Me,

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:53.182
And I'm Glad That
I Found That Joy Again.

01:25:53.182 --> 01:25:57.102
And I Think That, In That Way,
His Spirit Is Still With Me.

01:25:57.102 --> 01:26:03.172
He Surpassed What I
Ever Expected Of Him.

01:26:03.172 --> 01:26:07.102
I Expected
A Great Deal Of Him,
And He Surpassed That.

01:26:07.102 --> 01:26:09.162
There's An Element Of
God That's In People.

01:26:09.162 --> 01:26:13.132
Some People,
God Laid His Hand On Longer,
And Held It There.

01:26:14.232 --> 01:26:16.232
Michael:
Secretly And Privately,

01:26:16.232 --> 01:26:21.042
I Mean, Really Deep Within,
There's A Destiny For Me.

01:26:21.042 --> 01:26:24.042
And Just For Me To
Stay On That Track
And Follow It.

01:26:24.042 --> 01:26:27.142
I Really Believe And Feel
I'm Here For A Reason.

01:26:27.142 --> 01:26:31.152
And That's My Job, You Know,
To Perform For The People.

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:34.272
And If They Accept It,
Then I'm Rewarded,

01:26:34.272 --> 01:26:38.272
They Want To Put Me
Up On That Pedestal,
I Feel Even Better.

01:26:38.272 --> 01:26:40.202
Do You Ever Wanna Stop?

01:26:40.202 --> 01:26:42.272
No. Don't Stop
Till You Get Enough.

01:26:42.272 --> 01:26:44.112
You Haven't Had Enough?

01:26:44.112 --> 01:26:46.272
No Way! No Way.
