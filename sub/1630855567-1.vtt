WEBVTT

00:17.626 --> 00:20.542
- Uh, okay, this...

00:20.542 --> 00:22.413
Um...

00:22.413 --> 00:24.676
So...

00:24.676 --> 00:26.200
Hmm? Nah, I'm just...

00:26.200 --> 00:28.028
- You're just?
- Yeah, I'm just...

00:28.028 --> 00:30.334
I'm just--

00:30.334 --> 00:33.381
Okay, this--
this Dickinson line.

00:33.381 --> 00:38.603
"For each ecstatic instant,
we must an anguish pay

00:38.603 --> 00:42.868
in keen and quivering
ratio to the ecstasy."

00:42.868 --> 00:44.957
Oh, she's brilliant.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.482
But you're-- you're--
you're spin on this

00:47.482 --> 00:50.746
I love where...

00:50.746 --> 00:54.793
Okay. The piano wire
tight tension of the...

01:00.103 --> 01:05.717
...currency takes us years.

01:05.717 --> 01:07.154
It's so good.

01:07.154 --> 01:11.332
- You think?
- Yes. Yeah.

01:11.332 --> 01:13.421
Emily Dickinson's got nothing.

01:13.421 --> 01:14.683
Okay. No, no.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.946
You need to read more Dickinson.

01:16.946 --> 01:20.210
What is it? Something is
the thing with feathers.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.733
Something?

01:21.733 --> 01:24.345
Eric, you're missing
the most important word.

01:26.129 --> 01:28.653
- Anna?
- Partial credit.

01:33.005 --> 01:40.317
Alright, so one small moment
of joy brings the pain.

01:40.317 --> 01:44.887
One ecstatic instinct
we must an anguish to pay?

01:44.887 --> 01:47.846
I guess both.

01:47.846 --> 01:49.109
Anna?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.675
I have to go.

02:02.557 --> 02:03.906
Hey, I'll call you later.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.342
Don't-- don't--

02:10.652 --> 02:14.699
Why does Dickinson write
the word dwell in "Possibility?"

02:14.699 --> 02:17.267
Her dwell bothers me.

02:17.267 --> 02:21.576
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:21.576 --> 02:25.667
Um, I always viewed dwell
a little negatively.

02:25.667 --> 02:28.148
Possibility is there,

02:28.148 --> 02:31.803
but she doesn't leave her house,
you know?

02:31.803 --> 02:33.936
It's not
a coffee cup quote.

02:33.936 --> 02:36.634
That makes total sense.

02:36.634 --> 02:38.941
- Tea?
- No, I'm okay.

02:38.941 --> 02:45.730
Are you sure you don't want
some jasmine mint tea?

02:45.730 --> 02:48.255
Holy shit, Mom!

02:48.255 --> 02:50.996
Holy shit!
No, I knew it.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.389
I knew it when you told me
he was taking you

02:52.389 --> 02:54.217
to that ridiculous restaurant.

02:54.217 --> 02:58.265
Yeah, he did it.
And, well, I went with yes.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.180
I love this ring.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.660
It was his grandmother's.

03:02.660 --> 03:05.446
Oh, Mom,
I'm so happy for you.

03:05.446 --> 03:09.014
I'm so happy
for both you and Tim.

03:09.014 --> 03:12.235
Me, too.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.802
Wow.
- Yeah, wow!

03:18.807 --> 03:21.810
Did I overhear you
talking to a boy?

03:21.810 --> 03:23.377
I was in the hallway.

03:23.377 --> 03:26.118
Yeah.

03:26.118 --> 03:27.903
College boy?

03:30.035 --> 03:32.212
Anna?
- No, it's nothing.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.649
He lives 900 miles away.
It's nothing.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.999
Doesn't sound like nothing.

03:36.999 --> 03:39.349
Tim, get down on one knee
and all that?

03:39.349 --> 03:41.656
Nice try.
And yes, he did.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.353
It's nothing.

03:43.353 --> 03:46.400
It's just this guy
that I talked to online.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.707
I think those are literally
famous last words.

03:49.707 --> 03:52.797
Wow, so salty
now that she's engaged.

04:03.591 --> 04:06.028
I'm going to get a coffee.
Do you want one?

04:09.292 --> 04:10.989
Brit?

04:13.209 --> 04:16.604
I railed Mr. Golding
in the chem lab.

04:16.604 --> 04:19.302
He told his wife, and now we're
in a polyamorous threesome.

04:19.302 --> 04:21.652
It's great.

04:21.652 --> 04:23.915
Brit?
- Hi, sorry. What?

04:23.915 --> 04:25.308
Do you want a coffee?

04:25.308 --> 04:27.441
Uh, yeah, please. Thank you.

04:27.441 --> 04:28.964
You don't have to yell at me.

04:32.968 --> 04:36.537
Who's Eric?
- Don't answer that.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.016
Hi, Eric. Who are you?

04:38.016 --> 04:41.237
<i>Oh, um... hi.</i>

04:41.237 --> 04:42.456
Hi. Who are you?

04:42.456 --> 04:45.415
Hey, I'll call you later, okay?

04:45.415 --> 04:46.764
You can't do that.

04:46.764 --> 04:49.463
- Who's Eric?
- Not okay, Brit.

04:49.463 --> 04:51.900
You'll call him later?
That sounded like a man.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.032
What does that mean?

04:54.032 --> 04:55.425
Who is that?

04:55.425 --> 04:56.774
He's a little older.

04:56.774 --> 04:59.908
Okay.
How much older?

04:59.908 --> 05:02.519
I don't know.
College?

05:02.519 --> 05:04.216
We just talk.

05:05.914 --> 05:07.524
You're a naughty little girl,
aren't you?

05:07.524 --> 05:09.526
- Stop!
- Honey?

05:09.526 --> 05:11.876
Coming.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.968
"An old soul, having lived
through love and loss

05:16.968 --> 05:20.232
and past iterations,
sees the whole picture

05:20.232 --> 05:24.106
and is often described
as wise beyond their years."

05:26.761 --> 05:30.286
<i>See that--
that's definitely you.</i>

05:30.286 --> 05:33.333
FaceTime?

05:33.333 --> 05:37.075
<i>No, it's...</i>

05:37.075 --> 05:40.862
<i>I feel like...</i>

05:40.862 --> 05:44.256
You don't want to see me?

05:44.256 --> 05:48.173
<i>Like, sometimes I like
to just focus on your voice</i>

05:48.173 --> 05:53.440
<i>and your words without that
distracting face of yours.</i>

05:53.440 --> 05:55.267
Yeah, right.

06:01.404 --> 06:02.884
<i>I love this instead.</i>

06:02.884 --> 06:06.017
<i>We--
we actually see each other.</i>

06:06.017 --> 06:09.630
Yeah, sure.
Just swing on by, why don't you?

06:12.284 --> 06:15.940
<i>I mean, don't just think
we should meet someday?</i>

06:18.378 --> 06:20.249
No.

06:22.556 --> 06:25.559
it's part of the charm
of this relationship, Eric.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.909
The vast distance
that separates us.

06:33.480 --> 06:37.832
<i>I don't know.
It just doesn't feel right.</i>

06:37.832 --> 06:43.577
<i>I'd love to meet and
be in the same room with you.</i>

06:53.804 --> 06:55.676
I have to go to sleep.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.377
<i>- Anna.</i>
- This is me

07:01.377 --> 07:03.510
blowing you a kiss.

07:15.913 --> 07:18.525
So, I have two
open houses tomorrow,

07:18.525 --> 07:20.744
and then Tim and I are going
to meet with the caterers

07:20.744 --> 07:22.703
for the engagement party.

07:25.706 --> 07:28.665
But-- hi.
- Cool, cool.

07:28.665 --> 07:31.712
Um, I wanted to get back in time
to maybe do, like,

07:31.712 --> 07:34.454
a little birthday thingy
with you before you

07:34.454 --> 07:35.803
and the girls head out, okay?

07:35.803 --> 07:38.458
Thank you.

07:41.504 --> 07:44.638
Uh, also,
we have to sit down

07:44.638 --> 07:48.337
and formalize those college
tour dates, babe.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.211
Honey?

07:53.211 --> 07:55.779
Definitely.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.825
Girl.

07:59.435 --> 08:01.176
Let's go.

08:08.836 --> 08:11.534
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

08:11.534 --> 08:14.668
I was starting to think
you were ghosting me.

08:14.668 --> 08:18.498
No, no, I got--
got a little lost.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.761
What do you mean?

08:20.761 --> 08:23.154
I don't know where I am.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.505
I mean, I'll turn the camera
around, I'll show you.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.334
Pretty sure I can't help you,
but okay?

08:29.334 --> 08:30.858
No?

08:30.858 --> 08:32.816
What do you think?

09:26.870 --> 09:28.263
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

09:30.961 --> 09:33.181
Do you realize
how inappropriate

09:33.181 --> 09:35.052
and aggressive this is?

09:35.052 --> 09:36.967
<i>Yeah.</i>
Um, I'm sorry.

09:36.967 --> 09:40.057
<i>I-I-I...</i>

09:40.057 --> 09:44.888
<i>I guess
I thought it was a big</i>

09:44.888 --> 09:47.891
<i>gesture, but....</i>

09:47.891 --> 09:53.505
<i>Yes, a big, dumb gesture.</i>

09:53.505 --> 09:55.246
Yeah.

09:56.683 --> 10:00.121
<i>Shit.
I'm sorry.</i>

10:00.121 --> 10:02.123
What?

10:04.299 --> 10:07.694
<i>Look, um,
I have gifts for you.</i>

10:07.694 --> 10:11.611
<i>I'll just-- I'll leave it on
the porch, okay?</i>

10:14.396 --> 10:18.618
<i>Sh-- Sorry.</i>

10:18.618 --> 10:20.707
No, hold on.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.665
Uh, just-- just wait.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.156
Hi.

10:38.420 --> 10:41.379
Um...

10:41.379 --> 10:43.686
I have no interest in--
in coming in.

10:43.686 --> 10:46.036
I just--
I wanted to give you that.

10:51.476 --> 10:53.740
Happy birthday.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.528
Okay.

10:59.528 --> 11:02.487
Um, no, you know what?
Actually, I, um...

11:02.487 --> 11:05.273
One more thing, and then--
and then I'll go.

11:05.273 --> 11:09.712
You are even prettier
in person.

11:12.889 --> 11:16.197
Um, and um,
I'm going to go now.

11:16.197 --> 11:20.505
Um, I'm sorry if I
freaked you out.

11:20.505 --> 11:22.246
I'm an idiot.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.509
It's really dumb.

11:24.509 --> 11:26.686
Um...

11:26.686 --> 11:29.514
Call me later if you--

11:29.514 --> 11:31.516
if you like it.

12:15.256 --> 12:19.434
<i>"Her life had stood
a loaded gun.</i>

12:19.434 --> 12:24.178
<i>In corners till a day
the owner passed</i>

12:24.178 --> 12:28.008
<i>identified and carried me away."</i>

12:47.810 --> 12:51.248
How old are you, actually?

12:51.248 --> 12:52.859
28.

12:52.859 --> 12:56.427
Jesus.

12:56.427 --> 12:59.430
I'm not in college.

12:59.430 --> 13:06.089
I was, but
I dropped out a while ago.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.656
I have a lot of questions.

13:07.656 --> 13:10.398
And I just want to be straight

13:10.398 --> 13:12.356
with you
about everything.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.619
- That's thoughtful of you.
- Look.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.276
When we first met--
- Met?

13:19.276 --> 13:20.843
Eric, I met you, like,
half an hour ago.

13:20.843 --> 13:25.021
Okay, fine.
When we...

13:25.021 --> 13:32.028
When we first, you know,
got to know each other...

13:32.028 --> 13:36.119
I knew how special you were,
and-- and I--

13:36.119 --> 13:38.687
I panicked.

13:38.687 --> 13:41.864
You mean you lied?

13:41.864 --> 13:43.083
Yeah.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.478
Why did you panic?

13:49.872 --> 13:54.529
I mean, you're so
incredibly smart

13:54.529 --> 13:59.360
and you're funny
and you're kind and caring.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.884
You're like
1,000,001 other things,

14:01.884 --> 14:04.278
and I just--

14:04.278 --> 14:06.149
I knew I didn't want
to lose something

14:06.149 --> 14:08.369
with so much potential.

14:10.719 --> 14:13.678
Hey. Could you be there
at 4:30 today?

14:13.678 --> 14:16.420
I need help with the ribbons.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.074
<i>Ribbons?</i>

14:18.074 --> 14:20.903
Yeah, it's a thing we do.
It's ironic.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.166
<i>Is it now?</i>

14:23.166 --> 14:26.953
Yeah, 75% ironic.

14:28.868 --> 14:34.743
Well, congrats on your big,
dumb gesture.

14:34.743 --> 14:37.964
Well, you know, big and dumb
or go home, right?

14:45.232 --> 14:48.191
Thank you for the book.

14:48.191 --> 14:49.758
It was one of the most
thoughtful gifts

14:49.758 --> 14:51.760
anyone's ever given me.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.808
I'm glad.

15:07.428 --> 15:11.040
Um, okay.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.563
No.

15:12.563 --> 15:15.610
No, there's no way
I'm not getting a hug.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.835
Oh, man.

15:23.835 --> 15:26.099
Why?

15:26.099 --> 15:30.059
Why does your hair
smell so good?

15:35.847 --> 15:36.979
Jesus.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.981
I...

15:38.981 --> 15:40.287
I have to go.

15:40.287 --> 15:41.810
- Yeah, you do.
- Yeah.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.342
Babe.

15:52.342 --> 15:54.954
It's an ironic hat
and you have to wear it.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.520
It's a rule.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.218
- Where's the birthday girl at?
- I don't know.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.394
And the girl should be here
any minute to pick her up.

16:00.394 --> 16:01.786
Anna!

16:06.443 --> 16:08.837
Hey.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.447
- Oh, shit.
- What?

16:10.447 --> 16:13.320
Uh, my mom's home.
We fell asleep.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.799
Wait, what? What?

16:14.799 --> 16:16.410
Uh, you have to get dressed.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.107
- Oh, shit.
- Fast.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.327
Oh, shit.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.806
Uh...
- Shirt?

16:21.806 --> 16:24.592
Where's my shirt?
Where's my-- my shirt?

16:24.592 --> 16:27.682
- Anna?
- Hold on.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.031
Um, no, you have to hide.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.772
- What?
- Hide.

16:30.772 --> 16:33.383
Anna?

16:33.383 --> 16:35.255
Huh? Honey?
- Hold on.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.996
Don't.
Don't you knock?

16:36.996 --> 16:41.478
Sorry.
I thought you said come in.

16:41.478 --> 16:44.177
Um, I have something
for you downstairs.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.830
And the girls
are almost here, so...

16:45.830 --> 16:48.268
Yeah.
No, I'm sorry I snapped.

16:48.268 --> 16:51.010
I'm sorry I barged in.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.361
No, I fell asleep.
I'm just grumpy.

16:54.361 --> 16:55.710
No big deal.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.494
I'll be out soon.
- Okay.

17:00.323 --> 17:02.543
Oh.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.197
That's what?

17:04.197 --> 17:07.591
I don't know how I'm going
to get you out of here.

17:07.591 --> 17:10.855
- What do you mean?
- My mom and Tim are home.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.207
Uh, the window?

17:14.207 --> 17:15.512
Doesn't open wide enough
for a body.

17:15.512 --> 17:16.861
I've tried.

17:16.861 --> 17:19.038
I...

17:19.038 --> 17:20.778
I can't stay here.
- You have to.

17:20.778 --> 17:22.693
No, I can't.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.826
Okay, then let's go out there
and have Tim arrest you.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.745
Tim's a cop?

17:30.745 --> 17:32.703
Assistant chief of police.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.140
What?

17:37.621 --> 17:39.449
Is my head still intact?

17:41.451 --> 17:43.236
Yeah, I think so.

17:43.236 --> 17:44.802
'Cause she nearly bit it off.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.073
Birthday girl!

17:56.162 --> 17:58.816
- I won't be out late.
- No, I can't.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.166
I can't stay
in your house.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.777
I'll make it as quick as I can.
I promise.

18:02.777 --> 18:05.127
- Anna?!
- Coming!

18:05.127 --> 18:07.521
Please, just stay here.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.436
I'll be back soon, okay?

18:09.436 --> 18:11.481
I want to see you later.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.445
You promise?

18:18.445 --> 18:19.489
Yeah.

18:24.799 --> 18:34.243
♪ Happy birthday, dear Anna

18:36.419 --> 18:41.946
♪ Happy birthday to you

18:41.946 --> 18:43.818
Thank you.

18:43.818 --> 18:45.211
Uh...

18:48.344 --> 18:50.651
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, Mom.

18:50.651 --> 18:53.349
- Happy birthday.
- Wow, you too?

18:53.349 --> 18:55.960
Yeah, well,
apparently it's tradition?

18:55.960 --> 18:58.180
- Okay, well, we should...

18:58.180 --> 18:59.268
- Yeah, we have to go.
- Oh, wait.

18:59.268 --> 19:01.488
No, no, no, okay?

19:01.488 --> 19:04.055
I baked this vegan cake
from scratch.

19:04.055 --> 19:07.015
I know you don't like sweets,
but you have to at least try it.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.756
Okay, one bite
and then we'll go--

19:10.149 --> 19:12.542
-  That's good.
- You like it?

19:12.542 --> 19:14.022
- Mm-hmm.
- Bye.

19:14.022 --> 19:15.241
- Let's go.
- Bye, thank you.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.285
- It was good.
- She liked it.

19:16.285 --> 19:17.721
In one bite, she liked it.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.945
Denny, what's up?

19:25.686 --> 19:28.036
Hey.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.038
Oh, my God.

19:30.038 --> 19:31.605
Look.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.215
Denny.
- Yeah.

19:33.215 --> 19:37.132
So happy birthday, I guess.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.568
Um...

19:38.568 --> 19:41.180
Brit, who apparently is a liar,

19:41.180 --> 19:46.489
told me you wouldn't
be here, so...

19:46.489 --> 19:48.012
Thank you, Denny.

19:48.012 --> 19:50.885
Yeah.
Um, okay.

19:50.885 --> 19:53.061
Alright, uh, bye.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.584
I'll see you--
I'll see you later.

19:54.584 --> 19:56.151
Bye.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.240
- Bye, Denny.
- Stop.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.112
- Stop, that was so sweet.
- He is so cute.

20:01.112 --> 20:02.679
Oh.

20:19.870 --> 20:21.394
Yeah.

20:21.394 --> 20:22.917
You know I want to.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.180
Well, you have the pool.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.921
You have Hailey's room,
which could be for Anna,

20:26.921 --> 20:29.010
which is criminally large.

20:29.010 --> 20:31.752
We got the gym in the basement.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.669
You know, it's funny, right?

20:35.669 --> 20:38.237
You sold it to me, and now I'm
trying to sell it back.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.848
Yeah, well, I know where
all that asbestos is hidden.

20:46.593 --> 20:51.554
I just hesitate to leave
this place, you know?

20:51.554 --> 20:53.382
After Gary left,
we floated around

20:53.382 --> 20:57.212
to some shitty situations,

20:57.212 --> 21:03.740
and this is the first place
that's felt like home.

21:03.740 --> 21:06.265
I get it.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.918
I do.

21:27.895 --> 21:30.550
Hey, birthday girl, what you
doing on your phone?

21:44.477 --> 21:46.435
Hey, lady, you want
to join your birthday party?

21:46.435 --> 21:49.743
Sorry. It's just-- it's just
my mom checking in on us.

21:49.743 --> 21:51.527
Oh, God.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.486
Tim and her are like
my relationship goals.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.139
- Yeah.
- Love you.

21:55.139 --> 21:57.054
- You, too.
- You, too?

21:57.054 --> 21:58.708
What kind of shit is that.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.623
- What do you mean?
- You, too?

22:00.623 --> 22:02.103
- I love you.
- That's what I thought.

22:15.899 --> 22:18.337
Are you going
to call Tim Dad?

22:18.337 --> 22:21.427
No. I think that ship
sailed a long time ago.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.429
Your dad ever call you
on your birthday?

22:23.429 --> 22:25.735
No, I haven't spoken to him
since I was four,

22:25.735 --> 22:27.563
but I'm not interested.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.826
It's pretty much the only
time my dad calls me.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.303
Eric?

23:57.871 --> 23:59.046
Eric.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.583
<i>I'm sorry, but the person
you're calling...</i>

24:42.306 --> 24:47.398
Mom!

24:49.966 --> 24:51.490
Mom?

25:01.630 --> 25:05.329
Oh, my gosh.
- Sorry.

25:05.329 --> 25:06.548
What are you even doing up

25:06.548 --> 25:08.202
at this perfectly
reasonable hour?

25:08.202 --> 25:11.118
- I couldn't sleep.
- Sorry.

25:11.118 --> 25:13.294
There's that zucchini
muffin you like.

25:13.294 --> 25:14.817
Ooh.

25:19.866 --> 25:24.000
So, are you going to be in
trouble with me for something?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.698
What do you mean?

25:25.698 --> 25:27.438
I mean, I'm thinking
maybe you got up

25:27.438 --> 25:30.050
to something yesterday.

25:30.050 --> 25:32.008
What does that mean?

25:32.008 --> 25:34.358
Did you guys smoke pot
or something?

25:34.358 --> 25:37.187
Did we? No. Why?

25:37.187 --> 25:39.625
Well, because you hate cake,
and there's that.

25:39.625 --> 25:42.149
- That wasn't me.
- No?

25:44.281 --> 25:47.546
That was Brit. She was
begging me for more cake.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.852
I hope you don't mind.
Of course not.

25:49.852 --> 25:53.943
Did she like it?
- You got Brit to eat vegan?

25:53.943 --> 25:56.642
- Yeah, I did.
- Yeah, you did.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.948
Um, I'm just doing laundry.

25:58.948 --> 26:01.168
Do you need anything?
- No. I'll do mine later.

26:01.168 --> 26:03.605
Okay. And you girls are going
to go out later?

26:03.605 --> 26:06.390
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. Have fun. Be careful.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.088
- Of?.
- I don't know.

26:08.088 --> 26:10.133
Bad stuff and people
and drugs

26:10.133 --> 26:13.528
and any and all bad
things that you may encounter.

26:13.528 --> 26:15.486
- Right. Okay.
- Bye, baby.

26:15.486 --> 26:16.966
Bye.

26:46.343 --> 26:47.823
Oh, my God.

26:49.477 --> 26:51.914
Dude, I can't blame you
for expanding your horizon.

26:51.914 --> 26:54.090
These boys are still boys,
you know?

26:54.090 --> 26:55.614
Like, they're the same ones
we knew in fifth grade.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.267
They're just taller.
- Stop.

26:57.267 --> 26:59.226
Okay, what are you guys
not telling me?

26:59.226 --> 27:01.881
- What's up, Ronaldo?
- I'm more Messi.

27:01.881 --> 27:03.447
Ah, I see it.

27:03.447 --> 27:04.840
Hey, you want to do something?

27:04.840 --> 27:06.625
Like what?

27:06.625 --> 27:08.931
I don't know. 7-Eleven.

27:08.931 --> 27:11.281
Uh...

27:11.281 --> 27:13.588
Come on.

27:13.588 --> 27:17.331
Screw it.
Let's do something.

27:17.331 --> 27:20.203
Okay.

27:20.203 --> 27:23.293
Dude. I mean,
he's no Neil deGrasse Tyson.

27:23.293 --> 27:24.730
- Yeah, no.
- He's a nice guy.

27:24.730 --> 27:27.036
Don't you think?

27:27.036 --> 27:28.255
- Eric showed up.
- What?

27:28.255 --> 27:29.691
- Stop.
- No, he didn't.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.780
Are you serious?
- Oh my birthday.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.652
- What did you guys do?
- I don't know.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.044
We hung out.

27:35.044 --> 27:37.133
- You hung out?

27:37.133 --> 27:39.658
You can't stop smiling.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.051
I never met anyone like him.

27:42.051 --> 27:45.707
- Anna.
- He just gets me.

27:45.707 --> 27:49.189
Okay, you should be careful.
You don't really know this guy.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.104
I think I do.

27:51.104 --> 27:52.279
Plus, he's kind of old.

27:52.279 --> 27:55.499
He's not that old.

27:55.499 --> 27:57.197
So is this going to be, like,
a whole thing?

27:57.197 --> 27:59.765
I don't know. Maybe.

27:59.765 --> 28:02.028
Hey, you guys
coming or what?!

28:02.028 --> 28:03.203
Yeah!

28:03.203 --> 28:05.335
Uh, I'll catch up.

28:07.555 --> 28:10.340
Send no nudes, dude.
Sextortion, it's real.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.734
My mom made me watch a whole
Ted talk about it. It's crazy.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.694
- Okay.
- Okay?

28:15.694 --> 28:18.218
Jesus Christ, where are you?

28:18.218 --> 28:22.048
Um, I don't know.

28:22.048 --> 28:25.355
Sad truck stop somewhere.

28:25.355 --> 28:29.620
I've been calling you
since last night.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.622
<i>Phone was dead. Sorry.</i>

28:33.799 --> 28:36.323
You're going home.

28:36.323 --> 28:38.542
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:38.542 --> 28:41.371
I came home,
and you weren't there.

28:41.371 --> 28:44.026
Yeah.
And it was weird as shit.

28:44.026 --> 28:47.595
Being there with your mom.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.989
No, I know, but Anna,
it was too weird.

28:49.989 --> 28:52.774
Like...

28:52.774 --> 28:56.865
I heard her get in the shower,
and I-- I got out of there.

28:56.865 --> 28:59.650
You ate a piece of cake.

28:59.650 --> 29:02.566
<i>Oh, man.
What a fucking birthday.</i>

29:03.959 --> 29:05.744
You left the plate out,

29:05.744 --> 29:07.267
and my mom found it.

29:07.267 --> 29:08.529
<i> Oh, shit.</i>

29:08.529 --> 29:11.227
I'm so sorry.

29:11.227 --> 29:12.663
It's not funny.

29:12.663 --> 29:15.318
I mean, it's funny,
but it's not. I'm sorry.

29:15.318 --> 29:18.800
Yeah. You know,
you should be sorry, you psycho.

29:24.588 --> 29:28.767
<i>You, Anna, are the
very best thing that</i>

29:28.767 --> 29:31.421
<i>happened to me
in a long time.</i>

29:39.647 --> 29:42.302
I'll call you later.

29:42.302 --> 29:44.347
<i>Definitely.</i>

29:44.347 --> 29:47.786
Okay, cool.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.223
<i>Alright, bye.</i>

29:50.223 --> 29:52.834
Bye.

30:06.108 --> 30:07.718
I mean, I think
it's enough room.

30:07.718 --> 30:09.546
- Well, yeah. I mean...
- Hey.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.418
- Hey.
- Hey, come check this out.

30:13.594 --> 30:15.465
- Is this the place?
- Yeah, it's one of them.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.685
Okay, so the ceremony
would be here,

30:17.685 --> 30:20.079
and then they have the pole barn
as a weather backup.

30:20.079 --> 30:23.952
You can have the fire pit
outside and the band out there.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.562
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

30:25.562 --> 30:27.695
We think this is the one.
- Cool.

30:27.695 --> 30:28.957
- Yeah.
- Do you want to see

30:28.957 --> 30:31.873
the other one?

30:31.873 --> 30:34.223
Okay.
- I think it's fair to say

30:34.223 --> 30:36.138
this is only interesting to us.

31:15.221 --> 31:18.006
Look at you, Mama.

31:18.006 --> 31:21.618
- It's cute, right?
- It's very cute.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.930
- You know what?
- Hmm?

31:28.930 --> 31:31.585
Tim is lucky to have you.

31:31.585 --> 31:35.371
What brings on that
random act of kindness?

31:35.371 --> 31:38.331
You know, I'm just--

31:38.331 --> 31:41.334
I'm just glad to see you happy.

31:43.118 --> 31:46.948
Thanks, baby.
I am glad to be happy.

31:48.776 --> 31:50.604
I just always thought
there was a part of you

31:50.604 --> 31:55.217
that didn't want
to let yourself be happy is all.

31:55.217 --> 31:58.568
Maybe.

31:58.568 --> 32:01.484
But if something makes you
happy, you should honor that.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.138
Right?

32:05.184 --> 32:08.187
I think so, yes.

32:08.187 --> 32:11.059
Agh.

32:24.768 --> 32:26.640
Hey.
Sorry, I had a hair issues.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.556
- No worries.
- Does it look okay?

32:29.556 --> 32:31.514
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:04.417 --> 33:06.027
I have a boyfriend.

33:07.376 --> 33:09.596
Oh, wow. Okay.

33:09.596 --> 33:12.773
Yeah.
Big news, I know.

33:12.773 --> 33:15.384
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

33:15.384 --> 33:16.951
You didn't say anything.

33:16.951 --> 33:18.779
I am now.

33:20.215 --> 33:23.392
- Denny?
- Nope.

33:23.392 --> 33:25.525
Do I know him?

33:25.525 --> 33:27.701
He doesn't go to my school.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.746
How do you know him?

33:32.532 --> 33:35.274
Oh, this is going
to sound worse than it is,

33:35.274 --> 33:37.015
but we met online.

33:38.625 --> 33:39.974
You met on the Internet?

33:39.974 --> 33:43.021
Yeah.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.632
How old is this guy?

33:45.632 --> 33:47.286
He's older.

33:47.286 --> 33:48.809
How old?

33:51.246 --> 33:55.294
Um...

33:55.294 --> 33:58.166
20s, mid 20s.

33:58.166 --> 34:00.342
Mid 20s?

34:00.342 --> 34:02.170
I think so, yeah.

34:02.170 --> 34:04.303
You can't do that, Anna.

34:04.303 --> 34:07.567
You can't do that.

34:07.567 --> 34:09.612
Too late.

34:14.226 --> 34:16.750
- I know, I know.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.143
I need a better attack.

34:28.762 --> 34:30.764
I knew I shouldn't
have told you.

34:30.764 --> 34:33.027
No.

34:33.027 --> 34:36.074
I'm glad you did.
I am.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.120
I-I just...

34:39.120 --> 34:40.861
What?

34:44.125 --> 34:47.085
I'm worried about you, Anna.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.565
I'm worried you might be
in over your head.

34:49.565 --> 34:52.655
I'm not in over my head.

34:52.655 --> 34:55.571
How do you know?

34:55.571 --> 34:57.486
I'm in love.

34:59.445 --> 35:00.707
Anna.

35:00.707 --> 35:03.188
What?

35:03.188 --> 35:05.755
I don't want to keep anything
from you anymore.

35:05.755 --> 35:08.410
Good.
I don't want you to.

35:08.410 --> 35:10.760
This has been
really stressing me out.

35:10.760 --> 35:14.547
Oh, I'm sure.

35:16.070 --> 35:17.637
And we can figure this out.

35:17.637 --> 35:20.683
There's nothing to figure out.

35:27.081 --> 35:30.606
Uh, where--
where does he live?

35:30.606 --> 35:32.739
Really far away.

35:32.739 --> 35:35.437
Like 900 miles.

35:35.437 --> 35:38.832
So, you guys have
never seen each other?

35:38.832 --> 35:41.704
No, we have.

35:41.704 --> 35:43.053
Did you--

35:43.053 --> 35:45.055
Are you having sex?

35:51.061 --> 35:53.194
He comes here?

35:53.194 --> 35:57.416
He drives 900 miles to see you?

35:57.416 --> 35:59.026
Yeah.

36:00.897 --> 36:02.421
Where is he?

36:02.421 --> 36:04.162
Where is he now?

36:06.207 --> 36:09.167
He's here, actually.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.169
He's outside.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.866
He's here?

36:12.866 --> 36:14.346
Yeah.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.739
He wants to meet you,

36:16.739 --> 36:20.308
and I want you to meet him.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.745
Are you sure about that?

36:24.443 --> 36:26.184
Okay.

36:29.230 --> 36:30.579
Okay.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.590
Nobody's dead yet.

36:41.590 --> 36:44.245
It's still early.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.595
- Come on.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.733
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:55.822 --> 36:57.911
Hey. Tim.

36:57.911 --> 36:59.869
Eric.
- Nice to meet you.

36:59.869 --> 37:02.132
And that's my mom, Beth.

37:04.657 --> 37:06.615
Hey, Beth.

37:12.491 --> 37:14.101
Yeah, yeah.

37:14.101 --> 37:15.624
We're taking all this
in right now.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.844
- Sure, I understand.
- It's a lot of new info.

37:17.844 --> 37:21.804
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

37:24.154 --> 37:27.245
Um...

37:27.245 --> 37:31.074
Yeah. Uh, look, let me--
let me start out by saying

37:31.074 --> 37:36.210
I never intended
for any of this to happen.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.736
We met online.

37:40.736 --> 37:42.390
- On a poetry forum.
- Yeah.

37:42.390 --> 37:45.088
We was--
We were talking poetry.

37:45.088 --> 37:47.221
I mean, that's it.
I didn't know

37:47.221 --> 37:52.574
anything about Anna.

37:52.574 --> 37:55.577
I don't know. Really,
the truth is we--

37:55.577 --> 37:58.841
we fell in love
before we even knew it.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.019
Mom.

38:04.804 --> 38:05.892
- Give her a second.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:05.892 --> 38:08.547
I'm sorry.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.244
- I'm sorry.
- No, you don't have

38:10.244 --> 38:12.028
anything to be sorry about.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.428
Hey.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.216
We can handle this.

38:26.216 --> 38:28.218
It's a crush.

38:28.218 --> 38:29.437
Hailey did something similar.

38:29.437 --> 38:32.005
I want him out.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.572
What?

38:33.572 --> 38:37.271
He needs to be out of my house.

38:37.271 --> 38:38.794
I think if you make it
off limits to Anna,

38:38.794 --> 38:40.361
she's just gonna--

38:44.800 --> 38:46.846
- Get the hell out of my house.
- No, Mom.

38:46.846 --> 38:48.543
- Get out now.
- Okay.

38:48.543 --> 38:49.979
- Out.
- No, it's not okay.

38:49.979 --> 38:52.765
No, if he goes, I go.

38:52.765 --> 38:55.202
- No.
- Yes, I go with him.

38:59.293 --> 39:01.861
Eric, can I talk
to you alone for a minute?

39:01.861 --> 39:02.992
- No.
- Yeah.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.820
- It is Eric, right?
- No, no.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.126
- Hey, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

39:06.126 --> 39:08.476
It's okay.
It's okay.

39:24.884 --> 39:27.016
You look beautiful.

39:29.715 --> 39:31.107
What?

39:39.246 --> 39:41.248
I mean...

39:46.862 --> 39:49.604
Hey, come on.
Give them a second.

39:52.781 --> 39:55.044
What am I doing here?

39:55.044 --> 39:56.611
Well, that's an interesting question.

39:56.611 --> 40:03.792
I don't know. What am I--
What am I doing here?

40:03.792 --> 40:05.794
What's going on?

40:07.361 --> 40:08.710
Nothing.
I-I just have to go.

40:08.710 --> 40:10.059
- What did she say to you?
- She didn't--

40:10.059 --> 40:11.496
I just have to go.
- What did you say?

40:11.496 --> 40:13.367
Nothing. Hey, she didn't
say anything, okay?

40:13.367 --> 40:15.413
There's just nothing
to be done right now.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.023
We're just stuck. That's it.
- I don't want you to go.

40:17.023 --> 40:18.546
Everybody needs a little break.

40:18.546 --> 40:20.461
I'll come with you.
- No, Anna.

40:20.461 --> 40:22.332
You're mom's right.
This isn't the way to do this.

40:22.332 --> 40:25.248
Where are you going?

40:25.248 --> 40:27.599
I'll be back.

40:27.599 --> 40:29.339
Okay? I promise.

40:36.085 --> 40:38.697
Look, I know
that this is hard for you.

40:40.916 --> 40:42.831
And I'm sorry.

40:44.877 --> 40:47.923
But we felt like this
was the right thing to do.

40:51.013 --> 40:52.928
Getting it out in the open.

40:56.018 --> 40:57.455
It'll be okay.

41:02.851 --> 41:04.418
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

41:04.418 --> 41:05.898
Okay.

41:07.943 --> 41:09.162
It's going to be okay.

41:17.518 --> 41:19.041
What did you say to him?

41:19.041 --> 41:20.869
- Anna, take it easy.
- Stay out of it.

42:03.172 --> 42:04.957
This will pass.

42:04.957 --> 42:06.436
She has a crush.

42:06.436 --> 42:09.004
They had sex.

42:09.004 --> 42:11.790
- When?
- I don't know.

42:11.790 --> 42:15.663
Her birthday or just after he
waited until she was 17.

42:15.663 --> 42:18.274
He knew what he was doing.

42:18.274 --> 42:22.888
He knew exactly
what he was doing.

42:22.888 --> 42:24.411
It's a hell
of a lot of calculation.

42:24.411 --> 42:26.935
Yes, it is.

42:26.935 --> 42:28.328
What if that's not the case?

42:28.328 --> 42:31.461
- It is the case.
- How do you know?

42:31.461 --> 42:34.856
Because I know, Tim.

42:34.856 --> 42:36.684
Okay.

42:36.684 --> 42:39.426
I never want to see
that man again.

42:49.828 --> 42:52.744
Hey.

42:52.744 --> 42:56.138
We got this, okay?

42:56.138 --> 42:57.618
We got this together.

42:57.618 --> 42:59.185
I know it seems like
a big deal right now,

42:59.185 --> 43:03.102
but we got this.

43:03.102 --> 43:04.364
Okay?

43:10.022 --> 43:11.327
Are you okay?

43:23.122 --> 43:25.733
I made you one
of your protein smoothies.

43:25.733 --> 43:28.606
Extra mango.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.043
Anna, please.

43:34.046 --> 43:35.395
I don't want you to get hurt.

43:35.395 --> 43:38.311
You understand that, right?

43:38.311 --> 43:40.705
Then why are you hurting me?

43:40.705 --> 43:42.881
Anna.

43:42.881 --> 43:45.666
Jesus Christ.

43:45.666 --> 43:48.277
Did you really think
that your mom and her cop fiancé

43:48.277 --> 43:51.193
were just going to grab your man
boyfriend in for a big group hug

43:51.193 --> 43:52.673
when they met or what?
- No, but I

43:52.673 --> 43:54.675
didn't think she'd go
as crazy as she did.

43:54.675 --> 43:56.546
Surprised the shit out of me.

43:58.679 --> 44:00.420
What are you going to do?

44:00.420 --> 44:03.205
I don't know.
Eric won't call me back.

44:03.205 --> 44:05.686
Yeah, maybe his future
father-in-law cop

44:05.686 --> 44:07.166
freaked him out a little bit.

44:07.166 --> 44:10.648
No, trust me, my mom
was way more terrifying.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.954
Look, maybe it's for the best,
you know?

44:12.954 --> 44:15.957
Let's not, Brit.
Don't say that.

44:15.957 --> 44:17.698
- Okay.
- She's not going

44:17.698 --> 44:19.395
to win this one.

44:21.571 --> 44:23.312
Okay.

44:25.445 --> 44:27.839
- I think we look good in it.
- Mm-hmm.

44:27.839 --> 44:30.319
I mean, it's-- it's stunning.

44:30.319 --> 44:31.973
- Thank you.
- And if you decide you want

44:31.973 --> 44:35.063
to make an offer,
just give me a call or...

44:35.063 --> 44:36.543
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you so much.

44:36.543 --> 44:39.111
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, guys.

44:58.826 --> 45:00.741
Jesus.
- Sorry.

45:00.741 --> 45:03.788
I, uh...

45:03.788 --> 45:05.615
thought you were
at the door.

45:08.793 --> 45:10.490
You can't be here.

45:10.490 --> 45:15.713
Well, I mean, sign out front
says open house.

45:23.503 --> 45:29.030
It's weird to see you do
something other than teaching.

45:29.030 --> 45:30.989
Jesse.

45:34.862 --> 45:37.560
I'll see you in a little bit.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.867
- What?
- Those were the last words

45:39.867 --> 45:42.130
that you ever said to me.

45:43.915 --> 45:45.220
I don't remember.

45:47.527 --> 45:49.877
I do.

45:49.877 --> 45:51.749
I guess I just didn't realize
that a little bit

45:51.749 --> 45:54.534
could mean 12 years.
- We couldn't talk.

45:54.534 --> 45:57.798
- Why?
- What was stopping us?

45:57.798 --> 46:04.196
Well, your parents,
my husband, attorneys, everyone.

46:04.196 --> 46:07.590
Yeah, but what they said
didn't matter.

46:07.590 --> 46:10.158
What you said did.

46:12.291 --> 46:13.771
And then I'll see you
in a little bit,

46:13.771 --> 46:16.295
and-- and [chuckles], what?

46:16.295 --> 46:18.253
Nothing.

46:18.253 --> 46:21.256
For 12 years until I seek
you out.

46:21.256 --> 46:23.519
Via my daughter.

46:25.652 --> 46:28.394
Well, I mean,
that just happened.

46:28.394 --> 46:30.613
You just happened to
seek me out on the Internet

46:30.613 --> 46:34.139
and run into her
and somehow just end up,

46:34.139 --> 46:39.492
whoops, falling in love
with my child?

46:39.492 --> 46:43.148
She's an amazing person,

46:43.148 --> 46:45.106
but I'm sure
you already know that.

46:49.458 --> 46:52.070
Whatever you think
you have with Anna, it's over.

46:52.070 --> 46:53.332
You're going to
ruin that, too.

46:53.332 --> 46:57.292
- She's 16.
- She's 17.

46:57.292 --> 46:59.904
And that's your argument?

46:59.904 --> 47:02.863
That she's too young?
- That is different.

47:02.863 --> 47:04.169
Why?

47:04.169 --> 47:05.518
Because she's a girl?

47:05.518 --> 47:07.302
No.

47:07.302 --> 47:10.131
The difference is
and this is a huge difference,

47:10.131 --> 47:12.568
is nothing ever happened
between you and me.

47:17.095 --> 47:21.142
What do...

47:21.142 --> 47:22.491
What do you mean?

47:22.491 --> 47:23.841
- This isn't good, Jesse?
- What do you mean

47:23.841 --> 47:25.494
nothing happened?
- Something happened,

47:25.494 --> 47:27.148
just not what you think,
not what you told the school.

47:27.148 --> 47:31.457
- How can you even say that?
- Because it's the truth.

47:31.457 --> 47:33.589
I know this might be hard
for you to hear,

47:33.589 --> 47:36.941
but it's important
that you hear it.

47:36.941 --> 47:40.335
We were close, too close.
That's on me.

47:40.335 --> 47:43.338
I was the adult, and I should
have known better, but--

47:43.338 --> 47:47.212
But what?

47:47.212 --> 47:52.652
This thing happens,
happens sometimes, Jesse.

47:52.652 --> 47:56.090
People want things to be
a certain way,

47:56.090 --> 48:00.051
and so they begin to believe
that it's true.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.102
Hold on.

48:08.102 --> 48:10.148
Particularly when you're young,

48:10.148 --> 48:11.932
and there's nothing
wrong with that.

48:11.932 --> 48:14.979
You know, I think
that goes both ways, too.

48:14.979 --> 48:17.546
What do you mean?

48:17.546 --> 48:19.200
That some people don't want
to remember something

48:19.200 --> 48:21.855
so they block it out?

48:21.855 --> 48:24.684
I hear about that, too.

48:24.684 --> 48:28.383
It doesn't mean there's
something wrong with you.

48:28.383 --> 48:31.212
- Jesse.
- Beth.

48:33.475 --> 48:38.219
I had always hoped
that you found some help.

48:38.219 --> 48:43.311
And I'm sorry that no one ever
stepped in to help you.

48:45.792 --> 48:47.837
You need to go home.

48:47.837 --> 48:50.405
- I don't have a home.
- Well, I do.

48:50.405 --> 48:53.756
And I don't ever want
to see you near it again.

48:53.756 --> 48:55.280
Move away from the door.

49:06.595 --> 49:09.250
Sorry.

49:09.250 --> 49:11.383
I should probably move that, right?

49:11.383 --> 49:14.125
Please, Jesse.

49:14.125 --> 49:15.778
There you go.
It's perfect.

49:15.778 --> 49:17.911
You want to tell him everything
or should I?

49:19.739 --> 49:22.263
I mean this in the most
caring way possible.

49:22.263 --> 49:24.526
You need to speak with someone.
- Yeah.

49:24.526 --> 49:27.225
You.

49:27.225 --> 49:28.791
Everything okay?

49:28.791 --> 49:30.924
Can you please
just move your car?

49:30.924 --> 49:33.318
Yeah. Hey, Beth.

49:33.318 --> 49:36.190
When you see Anna,

49:36.190 --> 49:38.540
tell her that nothing happened, okay?

49:38.540 --> 49:40.281
That there is no love
between us.

49:40.281 --> 49:42.805
That it's just her overly active
imagination, that it's just

49:42.805 --> 49:44.633
some sort of psychotic
wish fulfillment at work.

49:44.633 --> 49:47.462
Can you tell her that for me?
Please, get some help.

49:47.462 --> 49:49.899
You want to help me?

49:49.899 --> 49:51.640
Tell the truth?
- What truth?

49:51.640 --> 49:53.294
That you were in love with me

49:53.294 --> 49:54.643
as much as I was
in love with you.

49:54.643 --> 49:58.212
I want to hear you
say it out loud.

49:58.212 --> 49:59.997
Say it!
- Okay.

50:01.824 --> 50:03.304
Let's think about this
for a second.

50:08.657 --> 50:10.485
There's two ways this could go.

50:10.485 --> 50:13.401
You want to know what they are?
- Sure.

50:13.401 --> 50:16.404
I can handcuff you,
arrest you, trespassing,

50:16.404 --> 50:18.798
maybe resisting arrest,
haul you off to jail,

50:18.798 --> 50:21.061
hand you off to my real
good buddies down there.

50:21.061 --> 50:22.454
It's not my favorite way.

50:22.454 --> 50:26.588
It's inefficient
for both you and me.

50:26.588 --> 50:29.417
You want to know the second way?

50:29.417 --> 50:31.506
I'm guessing you do,
so here it is.

50:31.506 --> 50:32.812
Get in your truck.

50:32.812 --> 50:37.034
You go home,
all the way home,

50:37.034 --> 50:38.905
and you never come back.

50:40.863 --> 50:43.083
How do I know this plays out?

50:43.083 --> 50:44.519
Because I have your plates.

50:44.519 --> 50:46.608
I have everything about you.
I know you.

50:46.608 --> 50:47.957
I got you.

50:50.351 --> 50:53.311
So yeah,
what do you think?

50:53.311 --> 50:55.052
Option two?

50:58.359 --> 51:00.057
Yep.

51:01.188 --> 51:03.625
Yeah, that's what
I would do, too.

51:03.625 --> 51:05.105
Smart.

51:07.499 --> 51:09.327
I get it.

51:13.853 --> 51:15.289
You're not
the first person to abuse

51:15.289 --> 51:16.943
their power over me.

51:19.989 --> 51:21.469
Right, Beth?

51:21.469 --> 51:23.558
Hey, Eric.

51:23.558 --> 51:26.170
What do you think?

51:26.170 --> 51:27.823
You think this is over?

51:27.823 --> 51:30.696
This whole messed up thing
that you're doing here?

51:30.696 --> 51:31.914
You think it's done?

51:34.961 --> 51:37.006
Yeah.

51:37.006 --> 51:40.271
Yeah, I do.

51:40.271 --> 51:41.576
Me, too.

52:26.099 --> 52:28.145
I was embarrassed.

52:34.020 --> 52:36.065
Okay.

52:36.065 --> 52:37.806
And?

52:41.201 --> 52:44.726
I was embarrassed,
so I didn't say anything.

52:48.600 --> 52:51.733
Well, maybe now is a pretty
good time to start talking.

52:59.828 --> 53:02.701
His name is Jesse, first off.

53:05.573 --> 53:08.750
He was a student of mine
at the academy.

53:11.492 --> 53:13.755
Okay.

53:13.755 --> 53:16.323
I never wanted to have
to tell you this.

53:16.323 --> 53:20.284
Jesus, Beth.
Spit it out.

53:20.284 --> 53:22.547
There was a scandal.

53:24.462 --> 53:26.681
Or a near scandal.

53:28.683 --> 53:30.032
I was accused of having

53:30.032 --> 53:33.122
an inappropriate relationship
with him.

53:35.386 --> 53:38.954
Yeah, a sexual relationship.

53:42.654 --> 53:47.006
I took him under my wing
too much.

53:50.575 --> 53:55.623
He developed
these feelings for me.

53:58.626 --> 54:00.280
- Okay.
- And he ended up

54:00.280 --> 54:04.284
creating this fiction.

54:06.591 --> 54:09.855
But I bear some
of the responsibility, too.

54:09.855 --> 54:13.380
He's right. It should have
never been personal.

54:13.380 --> 54:15.164
We should have never...

54:17.515 --> 54:18.907
gotten close.

54:18.907 --> 54:22.041
Hmm, okay, okay.

54:53.115 --> 54:55.814
- No prior arrests?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

54:55.814 --> 54:58.338
<i>Looks like he lives in an
apartment that his parents own.</i>

54:58.338 --> 55:01.646
<i>Not in school, I'm not even
sure he has a job.</i>

55:01.646 --> 55:03.256
Hmm. Alright.

55:03.256 --> 55:04.388
Let's keep an eye out
for those tags.

55:04.388 --> 55:06.128
Understood?
<i>Absolutely.</i>

55:12.613 --> 55:14.659
Hey.

55:14.659 --> 55:16.443
We need to talk.

55:16.443 --> 55:18.271
What is there to say?

55:20.404 --> 55:22.188
I owe you a huge apology.

55:24.364 --> 55:27.976
There's things
I haven't told you.

55:27.976 --> 55:29.804
A lot of things.

55:31.719 --> 55:37.203
So, he knew who I was
when we started talking online?

55:37.203 --> 55:41.294
I can only assume
that he was looking for me.

55:41.294 --> 55:49.476
Came across you and decided to
use you to get to me, I guess.

55:49.476 --> 55:52.392
I'm so sorry, honey.

55:56.440 --> 55:58.790
Why didn't you say anything?

56:02.359 --> 56:06.188
I saw him there and I froze.

56:06.188 --> 56:10.932
I panicked,
and it immediately brought me

56:10.932 --> 56:13.021
back to that time
when you were four years old

56:13.021 --> 56:17.504
and I let this kid
get too close to me.

56:17.504 --> 56:19.288
You should have told me.

56:25.904 --> 56:29.516
I was embarrassed
and just sick

56:29.516 --> 56:31.475
that I had brought
this heartache on you.

56:31.475 --> 56:34.129
Anna.
- Mom, just please.

57:23.744 --> 57:26.573
I assigned a patrol car
to your street,

57:26.573 --> 57:28.401
keep an eye on you and Anna.

57:28.401 --> 57:30.185
Good.

57:30.185 --> 57:31.970
How's Anna?

57:34.538 --> 57:37.279
Distant.

57:37.279 --> 57:40.979
Yeah.
She'll be all right.

57:40.979 --> 57:43.721
Yes, eventually.

57:46.158 --> 57:50.249
I do you have a bit
of other news?

57:50.249 --> 57:52.773
- What?
- The caterer said they could do

57:52.773 --> 57:54.906
the poppyseed ham biscuits
after all.

58:16.318 --> 58:17.929
Come in.

58:22.586 --> 58:25.502
Hey, want some dinner, honey?

58:25.502 --> 58:27.112
Huh?

58:46.218 --> 58:48.133
Okay, you got to get
out of your head

58:48.133 --> 58:51.789
and do something dumb and fun.

58:51.789 --> 58:55.357
Remember how you hounded me
after Jake pulled that shit

58:55.357 --> 58:57.142
that he pulled on me?

58:57.142 --> 59:00.058
I'm here to hound you back.

59:00.058 --> 59:02.974
I just don't get it.

59:02.974 --> 59:05.672
Well, there's nothing
to get, really.

59:05.672 --> 59:07.456
You just landed a psychopath.

59:07.456 --> 59:10.547
Or a psychopath landed on me,
which makes me an idiot.

59:10.547 --> 59:13.854
The last thing you are
is an idiot.

59:13.854 --> 59:15.769
Let's just focus on the fact

59:15.769 --> 59:18.076
that you just dodged
a big, fat bullet.

59:40.838 --> 59:42.491
No! No!

01:00:37.546 --> 01:00:38.809
Hey.
- Hey.

01:00:46.947 --> 01:00:48.949
You're here.

01:00:48.949 --> 01:00:50.429
So I am.

01:01:03.921 --> 01:01:06.663
Wow.
You're killing it.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.316
Thanks.

01:01:08.316 --> 01:01:09.970
- You heading out?
- Uh, yeah.

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:12.625
I'm going to pick up Brit
a little before the party.

01:01:12.625 --> 01:01:14.366
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:01:22.896 --> 01:01:25.116
I love you, Mom.

01:01:25.116 --> 01:01:27.161
I love you too, baby.

01:01:46.224 --> 01:01:48.792
<i>They're trying to get me
to test the wine.</i>

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.228
- Uh-oh.
<i>- Come on.</i>

01:01:50.228 --> 01:01:53.013
<i>The caterers
are already setting up.</i>

01:01:53.013 --> 01:01:58.976
Hey, this is your
last chance to bail.

01:01:58.976 --> 01:02:01.587
We'd only owe for the catering.

01:02:01.587 --> 01:02:03.371
<i>Not a chance.</i>

01:02:03.371 --> 01:02:05.243
Shit.
I need you to zip me up.

01:02:05.243 --> 01:02:07.332
<i> I got to go.
The florist is here.</i>

01:02:07.332 --> 01:02:08.812
<i>Love you.</i>
- You, too.

01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:12.337
Anna?

01:02:12.337 --> 01:02:13.904
Is that you?

01:02:13.904 --> 01:02:15.427
Hey, can you come sit me up?

01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:18.735
Sure.

01:02:20.301 --> 01:02:23.696
Don't call your cop fiancé.

01:02:23.696 --> 01:02:25.306
Please, just give me a second.

01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:27.178
You cannot be here.

01:02:27.178 --> 01:02:29.180
And then I'll leave.

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:32.139
They're expecting me
any minute.

01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:34.751
Do you know why I'm here?

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.753
You've put me
through enough, Jesse.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:40.452
So, no, I don't know
and I just can't care anymore.

01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:46.066
I think you will, though.

01:02:46.066 --> 01:02:49.635
I really do.

01:02:49.635 --> 01:02:51.942
First things first.

01:02:51.942 --> 01:02:54.335
I'm here for Anna.
- Well, you can forget that.

01:02:54.335 --> 01:02:55.859
Hmm?

01:02:55.859 --> 01:02:57.512
She's not here,

01:02:57.512 --> 01:03:00.472
and she will never go
anywhere with you.

01:03:00.472 --> 01:03:02.430
No?

01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:04.868
She knows who you are, Jesse.

01:03:04.868 --> 01:03:07.348
She knows everything.

01:03:09.437 --> 01:03:10.787
You're right about that.

01:03:15.095 --> 01:03:16.836
Maybe you should
check her room.

01:04:10.368 --> 01:04:13.850
So maybe you care
a little now.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.764
What do you want from me?

01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:22.206
No one believed me.

01:04:25.992 --> 01:04:27.776
Not even my dad.

01:04:29.648 --> 01:04:31.563
My mom, I think she wanted to,

01:04:31.563 --> 01:04:36.437
but mostly I think
she just wanted it to go away.

01:04:38.657 --> 01:04:43.053
The embarrassment to go away.

01:04:43.053 --> 01:04:47.187
For her, for the school.

01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:50.974
And then you are the only person
I ever trusted.

01:04:50.974 --> 01:04:54.194
You-- you turned on me, too.

01:04:54.194 --> 01:04:57.502
I heard what you said about me.

01:04:57.502 --> 01:05:00.461
Troubled, delusional, I think
were your words of choice.

01:05:00.461 --> 01:05:04.117
Jesse, no.

01:05:04.117 --> 01:05:05.902
And then our phone call.

01:05:07.991 --> 01:05:11.037
Do you remember?

01:05:11.037 --> 01:05:15.346
- No.
- I'll see you in a little bit.

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:23.223
And then I never heard another
word from you again.

01:05:23.223 --> 01:05:28.489
Jesse, this is not something
that we can settle now.

01:05:28.489 --> 01:05:30.839
We--
- I tried to kill myself.

01:05:34.104 --> 01:05:37.237
Yeah.

01:05:37.237 --> 01:05:39.196
That happened.

01:05:41.198 --> 01:05:44.897
I mean I failed, obviously.

01:05:46.899 --> 01:05:49.249
Jesse.

01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:52.252
But to have you call
me a liar...

01:05:55.690 --> 01:06:00.173
We can't do this,
just the two of us.

01:06:00.173 --> 01:06:01.783
We need to talk to someone.

01:06:01.783 --> 01:06:04.525
- Mnh-mnh.
- Just give me my phone.

01:06:04.525 --> 01:06:06.440
I don't need
to talk to someone, Beth.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:09.661
I need to talk to you.

01:06:09.661 --> 01:06:14.971
But since I've been here, I...

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.885
What, Jesse?

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:20.889
Can I show you something?

01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:37.906
Please?

01:06:52.747 --> 01:06:54.445
Here.

01:06:56.708 --> 01:07:01.930
This was that year.
This was spring of that year.

01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:06.413
- Yes.
- I mean, your hair is--

01:07:06.413 --> 01:07:09.025
your hair is short.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:14.421
Yeah, I cut it
over the holidays and...

01:07:14.421 --> 01:07:16.380
kept it short.

01:07:18.469 --> 01:07:21.037
Because I cannot be more
perfectly sure

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:24.344
that your hair
was long that spring.

01:07:24.344 --> 01:07:25.780
I could not be more sure.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:28.348
I mean, I-I remember
specific occasions.

01:07:28.348 --> 01:07:33.875
I remember your hair,
I remember your face.

01:07:33.875 --> 01:07:35.094
But you are--
you're in--

01:07:35.094 --> 01:07:37.662
you're in this picture, and...

01:07:40.969 --> 01:07:43.059
It was short then.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:45.452
I'm like feeling, like,
messed up

01:07:45.452 --> 01:07:47.367
about all of this right now.

01:07:53.939 --> 01:07:57.334
I mean, what?
Did I just want it so bad?

01:07:57.334 --> 01:07:59.858
Did I want it so bad
that I-- that I made it up.

01:07:59.858 --> 01:08:02.208
You know?
I mean, like...

01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:04.254
It happens, Jesse.
It's okay.

01:08:04.254 --> 01:08:06.647
And everything that I've done
since falling

01:08:06.647 --> 01:08:09.911
for Anne and now?
I mean, Jesus Christ.

01:08:09.911 --> 01:08:12.610
Because if that's-- if that's
the case, Beth, then--

01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:14.394
then-- then--
- Then what?.

01:08:14.394 --> 01:08:17.093
Then I'm a fucking idiot!

01:08:19.486 --> 01:08:21.314
God! Like, delusional.

01:08:21.314 --> 01:08:23.011
I'm like what
everybody says I am.

01:08:23.011 --> 01:08:24.709
I'm wrong.
I'm a liar.

01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:29.061
Like, all of these years.
Like, what-- what is that?!

01:08:30.802 --> 01:08:33.326
I ruined everything.
I ruined everything.

01:08:33.326 --> 01:08:35.111
I ruined your life.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:38.375
I mean, I know how much you love
teaching, and I ruined that.

01:08:38.375 --> 01:08:42.161
And I hate myself
for doing that!

01:08:42.161 --> 01:08:43.945
Oh, my God.

01:08:53.303 --> 01:08:55.696
I don't understand.

01:09:28.468 --> 01:09:30.209
It's funny.

01:09:32.298 --> 01:09:36.520
You're looking at this photo
as proof of a truth.

01:09:38.696 --> 01:09:40.698
All I see is a lie.

01:09:46.573 --> 01:09:48.662
We look happy.

01:09:51.926 --> 01:09:54.842
Gary was abusive, cheating.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.022
This photo's bullshit.

01:10:02.894 --> 01:10:05.244
I wasn't a capable mother.

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:09.944
I just wasn't.

01:10:16.690 --> 01:10:20.216
And then that night in the car.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:23.915
If I had told the truth,
I would have gone to prison.

01:10:27.092 --> 01:10:30.878
They would have taken Anna
from me.

01:10:30.878 --> 01:10:32.445
You get that, right?

01:10:32.445 --> 01:10:34.142
What truth?

01:10:36.144 --> 01:10:38.059
That I had fallen in love
with you.

01:10:46.546 --> 01:10:48.722
You were in love with me?

01:10:48.722 --> 01:10:50.942
It was wrong.

01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:52.509
Mnh-mnh.

01:10:54.554 --> 01:10:57.296
Mnh-mnh.

01:10:57.296 --> 01:11:00.038
Maybe not the feelings,
but the acting on them.

01:11:02.432 --> 01:11:03.694
What do you mean?

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.568
The sex, Jesse.

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.705
What happened in the car.

01:11:23.322 --> 01:11:24.802
I made a mistake.

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:32.592
What?

01:11:32.592 --> 01:11:34.681
Me?

01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:35.900
I was the mistake.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:41.253
I wish I could
take it all back.

01:11:41.253 --> 01:11:43.951
I wish--

01:11:43.951 --> 01:11:46.214
I wish I could undo it all.

01:11:48.129 --> 01:11:49.653
See, that's
the messed up thing.

01:11:49.653 --> 01:11:52.525
I don't--

01:11:52.525 --> 01:11:54.179
I don't wish that at all.

01:12:04.581 --> 01:12:06.974
Here, your zipper.
- No, it's...

01:12:06.974 --> 01:12:10.369
No, it's--
Here.

01:12:10.369 --> 01:12:12.023
- Thank you.
- That's it.

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:26.907
Beth?

01:12:26.907 --> 01:12:28.344
Hmm?

01:12:31.172 --> 01:12:36.047
Do you think it's
possible that maybe...

01:12:36.047 --> 01:12:37.396
What?

01:12:41.139 --> 01:12:44.229
That maybe you still
have feelings for me?

01:12:46.013 --> 01:12:48.712
No.

01:12:48.712 --> 01:12:50.540
Not like that.

01:12:52.846 --> 01:12:56.676
Anna does.

01:12:56.676 --> 01:12:59.331
And what are you
doing to her?

01:13:01.638 --> 01:13:03.379
Oh.

01:13:16.696 --> 01:13:19.960
I know it's just a word
at this point.

01:13:23.486 --> 01:13:27.098
But I am...

01:13:27.098 --> 01:13:30.449
so sorry.

01:13:30.449 --> 01:13:32.233
Me, too.

01:13:46.465 --> 01:13:49.729
I'm sorry I had to record
this conversation.

01:13:51.992 --> 01:13:53.603
Just happens to be one
of those states

01:13:53.603 --> 01:13:57.084
with a generous statute
of limitations.

01:13:59.173 --> 01:14:02.350
That isn't about ruining
your life.

01:14:04.527 --> 01:14:06.920
It's about fixing mine.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:12.099
And will this fix you?

01:14:16.016 --> 01:14:17.975
In a way I think it will.

01:14:20.543 --> 01:14:22.893
You know what?
I--

01:14:22.893 --> 01:14:28.725
What I've always wanted
is just--

01:14:28.725 --> 01:14:31.815
just to be acknowledged.

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:37.473
And you deserve
to be acknowledged.

01:14:46.525 --> 01:14:48.484
Thank you.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:49.876
Just...

01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:52.662
Just what?

01:14:52.662 --> 01:14:54.577
Please don't do this.

01:14:57.754 --> 01:14:59.190
Take that.

01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:01.279
Take me, take my words,

01:15:01.279 --> 01:15:05.065
but please
just don't take her.

01:15:05.065 --> 01:15:08.068
He's not taking me anywhere.

01:15:08.068 --> 01:15:12.116
I'm going with him.
There's a difference.

01:15:14.292 --> 01:15:15.598
You okay?

01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:24.302
Yeah.

01:15:26.565 --> 01:15:30.482
Thought I said
pack light.

01:15:30.482 --> 01:15:32.179
Sorry.

01:15:36.227 --> 01:15:37.402
We got to go.

01:15:37.402 --> 01:15:39.665
Hey.

01:15:39.665 --> 01:15:41.188
One second, Jesse.

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:12.959
We got to go.

01:16:12.959 --> 01:16:14.265
You should forgive her.

01:16:19.444 --> 01:16:20.706
I should forgive her?

01:16:20.706 --> 01:16:22.795
Yes.

01:16:22.795 --> 01:16:26.538
'Cause that's what you told me
this is all about.

01:16:26.538 --> 01:16:32.718
Not vengeance, moving forward,

01:16:32.718 --> 01:16:35.329
so we can all move forward.

01:16:37.941 --> 01:16:39.638
Like you said.

01:16:42.032 --> 01:16:43.947
That is what we're doing, right?

01:17:13.063 --> 01:17:15.631
I'll go get the car.

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:19.809
Um...

01:17:19.809 --> 01:17:21.985
I parked at the dead end.

01:17:23.769 --> 01:17:27.077
Apparently the cops drove down
every 20 minutes.

01:17:27.077 --> 01:17:28.774
Okay.

01:17:32.778 --> 01:17:33.910
Just be ready, okay?

01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:35.259
Yeah.

01:17:41.744 --> 01:17:43.310
Anna.

01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:45.051
Yeah?

01:17:46.879 --> 01:17:48.620
I'll see you a little bit.

01:18:17.257 --> 01:18:20.434
I know what you're thinking.

01:18:20.434 --> 01:18:24.700
You think I'm making
a huge mistake,

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:27.441
that I'm abandoning you, but...

01:18:27.441 --> 01:18:29.661
I don't think you are, no.

01:18:31.881 --> 01:18:33.621
Why not?

01:18:35.406 --> 01:18:38.278
Because I don't think
he's coming back.

01:18:40.759 --> 01:18:42.195
You're wrong.

01:18:45.068 --> 01:18:46.417
Anna!

01:20:06.323 --> 01:20:08.064
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:20:44.491 --> 01:20:46.406
There's my lady.

01:20:54.197 --> 01:20:56.155
We should go in.

01:21:01.944 --> 01:21:03.728
I know.

01:21:10.604 --> 01:21:12.345
Thank you.

01:21:14.652 --> 01:21:16.567
For what?

01:21:20.397 --> 01:21:22.703
For saving me back there.

01:21:28.927 --> 01:21:31.538
The only thing I saved you
from is prison.

01:21:35.978 --> 01:21:37.893
Fix your hair.

01:21:42.854 --> 01:21:44.856
It's your party.

01:21:44.856 --> 01:21:46.249
Smile.

01:22:13.537 --> 01:22:15.843
