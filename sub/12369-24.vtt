GREAT NEWS!

00:05.880 --> 00:07.549
I GOT THE RESULTS BACK
FROM MY DOCTOR.

00:07.632 --> 00:10.093

"DON'T WORRY,
THAT MOLE IS NOTHING,"

I SCREEN TEST IN CHARACTER,

01:12.071 --> 01:14.199

THE ACADEMY JUST LOVES IT

01:14.282 --> 01:16.367
WHEN A BEAUTIFUL ACTRESS
MAKES HERSELF LOOK HIDEOUS

01:16.451 --> 01:17.911
FOR A ROLE.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.329
ONLY I DIDN'T GET THE ROLE,

HOW YOU LOOK.

01:27.879 --> 01:31.466
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH HER?

01:31.549 --> 01:33.676
- MELANIE JUST FOUND OUT
SHE'S CANCER-FREE,

AND SHE'S TURNING INTO
ONE OF THOSE

01:35.470 --> 01:37.847

HAS BEEN CHECKED.

THE DIFFERENCE.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.035
- I REMEMBER MY WEDDING.

01:59.118 --> 02:00.870

CLUBBING YOU OVER THE HEAD

02:00.954 --> 02:03.540
AND DRAGGING YOU
TO HIS CAVE?

02:03.623 --> 02:07.210

I'M OLD.

YOUR WEDDINGS.

02:10.420 --> 02:13.132
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

02:14.759 --> 02:17.387
- YES, TWO MEN DID LEAVE ME
AT THE ALTAR.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.055
BUT SIMON

02:19.138 --> 02:20.348
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT
WITH OWEN

02:20.431 --> 02:22.141

HADN'T SENT HIM OFF.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.727
I KNOW HE'S A RAT FOR NEVER
TRYING TO GET IN TOUCH,

02:24.811 --> 02:28.189
BUT...THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR FIRST LOVE.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.817
- HE KNOCKED YOU UP
AND SKIPPED TOWN.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.446
- BUT I SEE THE POINT
JOY IS TRYING TO MAKE.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.616
I MEAN, EVEN MY PRISON WEDDING
WON'T BE AS SAD AS HER LIFE.

A NEW WARDEN AT THE PRISON

02:48.167 --> 02:49.711

WHICH IS SLIGHTLY REMINISCENT
OF A SUBWAY RESTROOM.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.808
- BECAUSE THIS DANK HOLDING CELL
IS WHERE YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.560
