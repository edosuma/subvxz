[Phil] My favorite quote
from baseball legend Yogi Berra

01:50.193 --> 01:52.612
is "Nobody goes there anymore,
it's too crowded."

01:54.114 --> 01:58.368
That's what smart sophisticated world
travelers would probably say about Venice.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.162
Why go? There's so many tourists.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.163
It's overrun.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.165
Why would you go
to such a touristy place?

02:05.250 --> 02:06.501
'Cause it looks like this.

02:10.338 --> 02:12.173
You know who we can thank for this city,

02:12.674 --> 02:13.591
Attila the Hun.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.678
Mainland refugees fleeing his invasion

02:17.178 --> 02:19.180
hid out on islands in the local lagoon.

02:19.430 --> 02:22.976
They decided to stay
and created this dazzling place.

02:23.977 --> 02:27.897
Venice is like a movie
that's been art directed.

02:28.439 --> 02:33.069
Every single place you look
is another stunning visual.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.867
And I'm pretty sure
I'm not the first person to notice this.

02:50.461 --> 02:53.089
Some places are touristy for a reason!

02:53.464 --> 02:54.716
Because people like it!

02:58.887 --> 02:59.971
Sorry for the yelling.

03:03.099 --> 03:06.311
I'm starting my trip with one
of the most Venetian things you can do.

03:06.394 --> 03:07.604
A cicchetti crawl.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.189
What are cicchetti you ask?

03:10.064 --> 03:14.277
Little bites of food on bread, like tapas.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.030
My guide is my good friend
Laura Sousounis.

03:17.572 --> 03:21.034
She's American, but she decided
to pack up and move to Venice.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.076
Can you blame her?

03:23.870 --> 03:26.748
So the first place, look at this place.
It's called Schiavi.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.417
And it's run by the beautiful Alessandra.

03:30.084 --> 03:33.254
She's been making the cicchetti here

03:33.379 --> 03:36.424
from her own recipes for 60 years.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.260
- [in Italian] Want a plate?
- [Laura in Italian] Yes.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.179
[in English] Alessandra asks
what you want.

03:41.262 --> 03:42.096
Everything.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.265
[Alessandra speaking Italian]

03:44.349 --> 03:45.683
[Laura] Do you want some wine?

03:45.767 --> 03:48.269
These were meant, like tapas,
to go with wine.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.647
So you have a little wine
in the middle of the day.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.401
Doo.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.821
-[Phil] What should be first?
-[Alessandra] Primo il baccalà.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.491
[Laura] It's just olive oil and cod. Mm.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.827
[Phil] It's so fresh and delicious.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.497
What's this?
This looks like a piece of fish.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.336
-What's left for me, Phil?
-Nothing.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.504
[Laura chuckles]

04:14.587 --> 04:15.588
Mm.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.632
-Yeah.
-Genius.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.677
[Phil] I developed a good system though.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.595
If you're gonna taste them all, right,

04:22.679 --> 04:24.764
you just pop them and leave the bread.

04:24.847 --> 04:25.682
Mm. Mm.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.726
I wanted what was on top of the bread,
so I was just...

04:28.810 --> 04:30.937
[making popping sounds]

04:35.566 --> 04:37.777
-This is the big ticket.
-Here we go. This is it.

04:38.444 --> 04:39.279
[Phil] Hear this:

04:39.779 --> 04:42.282
Tuna with cacao.

04:42.865 --> 04:46.786
Yes, cocoa powder on tuna
sounds disgusting, no?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.121
No!

04:50.999 --> 04:53.876
-Isn't that nice? Tuna, cacao.
-Wow!

04:53.960 --> 04:55.086
Who would have thunk it?

04:55.169 --> 04:56.963
-Wow!
-[Laura speaks Italian]

04:57.046 --> 04:59.007
-Wow!
-[Laura chuckles]

05:01.801 --> 05:03.052
-Grazie.
-Wonderful.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.847
[Phil] Our next stop requires a boat trip.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.765
-Your chariot. Look.
-Thank you, Phil.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.019
[Phil] And because of all the wine
I've had, maybe some Dramamine.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.105
-[Phil] Doh. Uh.
-[Laura chuckles]

05:18.359 --> 05:20.737
Never ever get tired of this. Ever.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.655
-And you live here!
-I live here.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.910
[Laura] I think Venice is meant
to be seen from the water looking up.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.330
Look, here's the Rialto Bridge.

05:30.872 --> 05:31.706
Hey!

05:34.000 --> 05:36.169
-There's the bus. Hello, bus.
-That's the bus!

05:36.252 --> 05:37.503
[Laura] This is our transport.

05:38.087 --> 05:40.089
What I love about this place
is you can't speed.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.259
You can go only as fast
as your feet take you or that boat...

05:43.634 --> 05:46.220
-which isn't fair. [laughs]
-The bus is the fastest thing?

05:47.263 --> 05:48.097
[Phil] Here we go.

05:49.057 --> 05:49.891
So--

05:53.603 --> 05:55.938
I thought we'd take
a little break between eating...

05:56.022 --> 05:57.231
and then go try on a few masks.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.569
[Phil] Masks have been
a thing in Venice for centuries,

06:01.778 --> 06:03.696
worn during the city's famous Carnevale

06:03.780 --> 06:06.366
or anytime someone, usually a noble,

06:06.449 --> 06:08.159
was looking for a little anonymity.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.827
[Laura] Sergio's shop is here.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.663
He and his brother and his son
and his family make masks.

06:12.747 --> 06:13.623
[Phil] Yeah.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.459
This mask is
the most traditional Venetian mask.

06:16.667 --> 06:17.543
Amadeus.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.045
[Laura] So?

06:20.838 --> 06:23.007
Where's my opera?
Did you finish my opera yet?

06:23.508 --> 06:25.718
Don't eat, don't sleep,
just finish the opera.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.595
-[Laura] Phil?
-Yes.

06:27.678 --> 06:28.679
[Laura] Ready to go eat?

06:30.223 --> 06:31.724
You need to finish my opera.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.226
[Laura laughs]

06:33.309 --> 06:36.437
Next up, All'Arco!
Another great cicchetti place.

06:37.313 --> 06:40.233
This is like gourmet
with artisanal ingredients,

06:40.316 --> 06:42.485
beautifully sourced meats and cheeses.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.487
-This is Mateo.
-Mateo.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.947
-This is Phil!
-My pleasure.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.073
Francesco's son.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.574
-These are the owners.
-[Phil] Nice!

06:48.658 --> 06:51.119
[Laura] You never know what he'll concoct.
Always different.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.538
-And he's a genius at this.
-I love geniuses.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.915
-Broke genius.
-[Phil laughs]

06:56.749 --> 06:59.502
And I met
the biggest celebrity in Venice...

06:59.919 --> 07:01.963
-[Phil] Nani the Wonder Dog.
-[Laura] He's famous.

07:02.046 --> 07:03.089
Everyone knows Nani.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.006
[man] Nani!

07:05.508 --> 07:07.260
-[Phil] The camera loves Nani.
-[Laura] Nani.

07:07.343 --> 07:11.639
And Nani will start barking if you're not
petting and scratching his neck enough.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.224
I should try that.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.727
He goes-- There he goes. And he'll-- See?

07:16.811 --> 07:17.937
Everyone knows him.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.480
He's a true Venetian dog.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.484
[Matteo] Is a mix. We have codfish,

07:23.568 --> 07:25.695
speck is smoked ham or salami.

07:25.778 --> 07:26.988
This is the salmon.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.786
Which one do I want?
I think I'm gonna have a bite of this.

07:35.621 --> 07:36.622
Perfect.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.040
[Phil] Where's my friend Eugenio?

07:39.417 --> 07:41.419
-Eugenio works on the crew.
-Buongiorno.

07:41.502 --> 07:44.172
-You said this is your favorite place?
-Yes.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.923
Take this chair. Sit next to Laura.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.594
You have to know Laura
because Laura lives very close by.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.054
-We're friends now.
-Now you can be friends.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.099
[Phil] As if these cicchetti
weren't enough,

07:55.183 --> 07:58.478
out come these beautiful sandwiches,
tramezzini.

07:59.353 --> 08:03.191
I'm grabbing grilled cheese with salami
and eggplant before anyone notices.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.862
Wow, do I love these. Wow, are they great.

08:08.112 --> 08:08.946
[Matteo] Good?

08:10.323 --> 08:11.157
Thank you.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.284
[chuckles]

08:14.327 --> 08:15.578
[Phil] Wow.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.872
It's lovely here.
You run into the fishermen.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.081
All the shopkeepers.

08:19.165 --> 08:22.335
-Run into judges with the courthouse.
-Let me be honest with you.

08:22.418 --> 08:26.088
I don't care if I didn't run into anybody,
as long as I ran into this sandwich.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.173
[Laura] I got one for you.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.094
[Phil] This is
the perfect Venice afternoon, isn't it?

08:34.972 --> 08:37.350
Let's go apartment hunting. [chuckles]

08:40.228 --> 08:41.938
How many bathrooms you got up there?

08:43.439 --> 08:45.691
[Phil] But before I make
those nice people an offer,

08:45.775 --> 08:48.736
one more stop for some
of the city's oldest kind of street food.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.280
-[Laura] Calamari and shrimps.
-[Phil] Yeah.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.367
There you go.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.537
So we're having
the classic working man's lunch here.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.790
I don't feel I've earned it.

09:06.754 --> 09:09.840
-Not terrible.
-Not terrible. Not terrible at all.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.010
[Phil] It's a good place to end.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.722
-Hopefully not everything.
-Yeah, everything.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.767
-Actually, it wouldn't be bad.
-No, if you were gonna pick a...

09:19.850 --> 09:22.812
-You'd just walk right--
-What would your last view be?

09:22.895 --> 09:25.314
-It would be Venice. It would be Venice.
-Not terrible.

09:28.776 --> 09:31.153
[Phil] But don't worry about me.
I'm not ending it all yet.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.239
I haven't had dessert.

09:34.031 --> 09:37.118
Off one of the tiny alleys,
there's a lady.

09:37.201 --> 09:39.453
She's got a little-- It's a like a closet.

09:40.162 --> 09:42.206
It's called Boutique del Gelato.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.292
-[Alessandra] Buongiorno.
-Buongiorno.

09:44.792 --> 09:45.710
Buongiorno a lei.

09:45.793 --> 09:48.212
-I'm Phil. How are you?
-[chuckles]

09:48.296 --> 09:49.672
I'm fine, thanks. And you?

09:49.755 --> 09:50.631
Tell me your name.

09:50.715 --> 09:51.757
Alessandra.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.302
[Phil] This lady,
she's there all day, all night.

09:54.385 --> 09:57.013
She makes the gelato.
She sells the gelato.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.974
She's not giving you a taste,
so don't ask.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.059
I need some of your chocolate.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.102
[Alessandra] Yeah.

10:03.185 --> 10:05.521
I want to try your stracciatella,

10:05.605 --> 10:07.607
and then what's the best fruit? The--

10:07.690 --> 10:11.193
[Alessandra] Do you want
the blackberry or the passion fruit?

10:11.485 --> 10:12.570
[Phil] Let's try blackberry.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.487
Blackberry.

10:14.739 --> 10:15.656
Blackberry.

10:16.949 --> 10:17.867
Stracciatella.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.035
[Phil] Yeah, I like it.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.536
-[Alessandra] And the chocolate.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.204
That sounds perfect, doesn't it?

10:22.496 --> 10:24.540
That sounds like the perfect combination.

10:24.915 --> 10:25.750
Okay, here we go.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.127
-I'm tasting your chocolate first.
-[Alessandra] Taste it.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.463
Yeah. Taste the first.

10:31.380 --> 10:32.381
Do you like it?

10:32.965 --> 10:35.551
I really like it. You know why I like it?

10:36.177 --> 10:37.386
It's very light.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.390
[Alessandra] Taste the passion fruit.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.393
Passion fruit! I get a taste?
You're giving a taste?

10:44.477 --> 10:45.311
Yeah.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.397
-What if people see this?
-Because you are-- Just for this.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.357
[chuckles]

10:52.443 --> 10:54.654
-[Phil] I know you--
-Are you happy to meet me?

10:55.446 --> 10:56.280
[Phil] I'm in love.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.201
I'm in love.
I don't go home to my wife now.

11:00.284 --> 11:01.786
[Alessandra laughs]

11:01.869 --> 11:03.120
She can't make ice cream.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.541
You know, I tell people
who make things like this...

11:08.626 --> 11:10.503
that you're in the happiness business.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.171
All you do is make people happy.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.882
These guys have to help.
I can't do it alone.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.967
-Look, James is game.
-Mm. Mm.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.474
This makes me really happy.

11:26.352 --> 11:30.648
I was eating my ice cream and I met
these two kids who recognized me!

11:30.731 --> 11:33.693
And they were adorable. So this is them.

11:33.776 --> 11:34.985
What country are you from?

11:35.069 --> 11:36.278
Philippines.

11:36.362 --> 11:40.074
-I love you. Here, you enjoy it.
-Oh my God! Thank you so much!

11:40.157 --> 11:41.701
This is the highlight. Thank you.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.869
See, I told you, this is the highlight.

11:44.036 --> 11:44.995
-Sweet.
-Thank you!

11:45.079 --> 11:46.414
-So nice to meet you.
-Thanks! Bye.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.541
-I love meeting you.
-Thank you so much.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.376
I was so flattered. They were so cute.

11:50.459 --> 11:56.340
And the next day, a man comes up to me
and he says, "Oh, oh, may I ask you?"

11:56.424 --> 12:00.177
I said "Yes." He said,
"Do you know where is a toilet?"

12:03.639 --> 12:05.933
But at least I'll always have Alessandra.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.143
[Alessandra chuckles]

12:07.226 --> 12:09.729
-Grazie mille. Ciao, ciao.
-Ciao.

12:09.812 --> 12:10.688
See you.

12:11.772 --> 12:14.358
-The hands that make the gelato.
-You are a really man.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.985
-[Phil] I am!
-[Alessandra laughs]

12:16.068 --> 12:18.112
[Phil] I'm gonna tell my wife,
"I'm a really man."

12:29.749 --> 12:31.834
[Phil] When I was here
a couple of years ago...

12:32.793 --> 12:35.880
friends of mine turned me onto Da Arturo,

12:36.297 --> 12:40.718
which is for some reason
legendary with Hollywood types,

12:40.801 --> 12:42.678
like Barbra Streisand and Tom Hanks.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.013
They love it here.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.016
-[Phil] Ciao.
-[man] Ciao. Buongiorno.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.226
-How are you? Welcome back.
-Ciao. Ernesto.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.103
-How is everything?
-Good to see you.

12:51.187 --> 12:56.442
There's one thing that I wanted to go back
and just show you how they make it

12:56.525 --> 12:59.403
because it's
the best of that thing I ever had.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.989
I dream about the pork chop.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.367
-I had it first two years ago.
-Yeah.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.120
And the way you did it
was unlike any other.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.165
I wanted to show everybody
this very special dish.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.959
And did you invent it?

13:14.376 --> 13:17.379
I open in 1968.

13:17.463 --> 13:21.342
And no like to make fish, but just meat.

13:21.425 --> 13:24.303
-There's no fish in this restaurant.
-No, fish, just meat.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.597
The people, they say me very crazy,

13:26.680 --> 13:30.518
because in Venice,
a small restaurant and no fish.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.521
-"Who's the crazy one now?," you say.
-Yeah.

13:36.482 --> 13:40.194
[Phil] They wouldn't just let me have
that one thing that I love.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.321
They wanted me to love these other things.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.074
Well... they won.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.619
You taste. It's my favorite.

13:48.702 --> 13:52.289
-Which one?
-Eggplant in vinegar, onion,

13:52.373 --> 13:54.041
-pine nuts and grapes.
-I'm gonna like that.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.793
[man] For me, it's the best.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.254
More than pork chop.
This is, for me, number one.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.756
I love this one.
It's invented 44 years ago.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.007
[Phil] There we go.

14:03.008 --> 14:06.387
And this with onions.
It's marinated for one week. That's mari--

14:06.470 --> 14:07.304
Come on.

14:08.806 --> 14:09.932
Mm.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.935
Stop it. No eat too much then,

14:13.018 --> 14:14.687
-Basta--
-It's after. Eat first.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.648
-I want more.
-[man] You can sit and eat.

14:17.731 --> 14:18.941
No, I don't want to move.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.070
[Phil] At least I got
a front row in the kitchen

14:23.153 --> 14:26.866
for the making of the best pork chop
the world has ever seen.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.416
[Phil] An egg and then flour.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.167
[cook] Flour, eggs, and bread.

14:41.714 --> 14:42.715
I'm so excited.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.385
Now, it's going. Look at it.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.059
Ernesto doesn't let you wait very long
before feeding you something else.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.312
Mushroom? Potatoes?

14:56.395 --> 14:57.688
Onion and sour cream.

14:57.771 --> 15:00.566
Onion and putted the sour cream.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.194
Oh, my God. I like this very much.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.654
[chuckles]

15:05.738 --> 15:08.198
-[man] Now is the season for mushroom.
-[Ernesto] Basta, basta!

15:08.365 --> 15:10.117
-Phil, now is the season--
-Ernesto!

15:10.200 --> 15:12.453
[chuckles]

15:12.536 --> 15:14.705
You're the only Italian
who takes food away!

15:14.788 --> 15:17.207
Then they make pork chop.
It's too much for you.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.919
-No, it won't be. I surprise you.
-No eat everything.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.759
So he's pouring off some oil now.

15:27.468 --> 15:31.555
To me, the genius of this
is what's about to happen.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.015
The final touch.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.559
[man] White vinegar, simple white vinegar.

15:36.518 --> 15:37.353
It's magical!

15:37.561 --> 15:38.854
This is the magic part.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.023
It's just white vinegar.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.066
That's all it is--

15:42.149 --> 15:45.027
What gives it this like incredible tang.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.613
I wish you could taste this.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.324
[man] You can take it home tomorrow.

15:50.407 --> 15:51.700
More... better tomorrow.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.078
-Really?
-Room temperature. Very, very good.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.497
Really? I put in my suitcase.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.998
Yeah, you can-- Yeah, really.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.833
That's for one person?

15:59.917 --> 16:00.960
-Sì.
-Look at that.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.544
Oh, my God.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.214
-Here I go.
-[man] Take it.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.091
-Hee hee!
-[man] It's yours.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.217
[giggles]

16:08.300 --> 16:10.219
Look, lookie, lookie.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.098
[Phil] This is like a fantasy.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.561
[man] Buon appetito.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.689
I'm gonna take a center cut.
How about that?

16:23.607 --> 16:26.026
We'll see if it's still good.
I'll tell you.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.202
Okay. No like. Ciao, ciao.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.371
Take it away. Come back!

16:37.454 --> 16:39.415
[Ernesto laughs]

16:40.124 --> 16:41.250
This is so fantastic.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.421
It just has this incredible kick to it
because of the vinegar.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.674
[man] Phil, today, I don't work.
I eat with you.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.719
-How about you? You want to sit down?
-[man] He's on diet.

16:51.802 --> 16:55.889
No like. I never eat here.
I go to the other restaurant in Venice

16:55.973 --> 16:56.807
You like fish.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.018
-[man] No, he...
-Sure, sure.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.398
Does Barbra Streisand
pick up the bone like this?

17:04.481 --> 17:05.566
[chuckles]

17:05.649 --> 17:09.945
Barbra Streisand very, very special lady.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.740
Leonardo DiCaprio, he's a very special.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.575
-Tom Hanks, very nice.
-Wonderful.

17:14.658 --> 17:15.909
-[Phil] Not impressed.
-The man--

17:15.993 --> 17:17.536
You know who I'm impressed with?

17:18.245 --> 17:19.288
[Ernesto] For me?

17:19.872 --> 17:22.624
All those people you mentioned,
they can't do what you do.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.168
-Sì, sì.
-You are right. [chuckles]

17:24.251 --> 17:25.586
-You're the bigger star.
-No, but--

17:25.669 --> 17:27.379
The artist is me.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.715
-That's right.
-Yes. I say!

17:29.798 --> 17:30.841
[Phil laughs]

17:30.924 --> 17:33.093
The people important is me,
not the others.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.219
The others? No.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.058
[Phil] It's not just the food.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.685
It's where you're sitting,
it's the history,

17:41.894 --> 17:44.438
and then, of course, the guys.
You know, the people.

17:45.022 --> 17:48.650
That's Da Arturo. I recommend it to you.

18:00.287 --> 18:03.540
[Phil] The gondola is a touristy thing.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.293
Now, I'm not meaning to disparage it,

18:06.376 --> 18:08.754
but you feel the need to do it

18:09.171 --> 18:12.716
because you got to get
that selfie in the gondola.

18:14.259 --> 18:18.347
They were the main transportation here
for centuries until motors came along.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.724
But now, only used for tourists.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.268
Yes, I get it.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.354
You want to have
the experience of the gondola.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.189
Yes, we rode in a gondola. Okay.

18:28.649 --> 18:33.278
I did not give these people
the respect they deserve.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.032
-Anna! Hi!
-[Anna] Hello.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.575
-Nice to meet you.
-[Phil chuckles]]

18:39.493 --> 18:40.661
-I'm Phil.
-Ciao.

18:40.744 --> 18:41.578
Ciao, Phil.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.747
This your first time in the boat?

18:44.081 --> 18:46.708
-First time in any boat. Yes.
-In any boat. Oh, God.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.752
No, first time in this kind of boat.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.797
This is a Venetian, typical Venetian boat.
Flat bottom.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.717
-Yes. Me too.
-And we try today in two positions.

18:55.801 --> 18:56.927
-In front.
-Yes.

18:57.010 --> 19:00.097
And on the back like a gondolier,

19:00.472 --> 19:02.141
standing on the top.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.518
-Really? Stand like there?
-Yes! Here.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.602
Give me your hand.

19:08.522 --> 19:09.606
[Phil] Whoa.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.484
-You're not kidding, it's a boat! Okay.
-[Anna] Oh, no. This way.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.944
-[Phil] This way. Sure!
-[Anna] Yes.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.487
Come. [laughs]

19:17.072 --> 19:17.948
-Flat.
-[Phil] Here?

19:18.031 --> 19:20.868
-Yes. This is perfect. Okay, relax.
-Perfect.

19:20.951 --> 19:23.370
-[Phil] Really?
-No stuck fish. Really relax.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.581
[Anna] Okay, you are a dancer now.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.334
Okay, I touch you. Sorry.
Turn your wrists now.

19:29.418 --> 19:33.005
Lift your hands and dance with me.
Come on. Push.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.841
Yes, it is. And touch here.

19:35.924 --> 19:39.219
Turn, lift, push with your palms.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.013
Yes. Perfect.

19:41.096 --> 19:43.348
[Phil] I just figured out rowing,
regular rowing

19:43.432 --> 19:46.018
like a row boat.
This is the complete opposite. You push.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.229
It doesn't even make sense what I'm doing.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.816
This is my enemy. [laughs]

19:54.109 --> 19:56.320
-[Anna] Ciao!
-Ciao! We're coming after you!

19:56.403 --> 19:57.779
[Anna laughs]

19:58.947 --> 19:59.781
[Anna] Are you ready?

19:59.865 --> 20:01.408
-I'm ready.
-[Anna] Okay.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.826
Go, push, push.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.661
Good job.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.830
Hey! You are fantastic.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.081
I am fantastic!

20:08.165 --> 20:09.917
-[Anna] Good job!
-[Phil] Hello, Venice!

20:19.009 --> 20:19.885
[Anna] Good job.

20:21.762 --> 20:22.930
Yoo-hoo!

20:23.013 --> 20:25.098
-[Phil] Hey!
-[Anna] Yoo-hoo!

20:25.182 --> 20:26.350
[Phil] Whoo!

20:26.433 --> 20:29.353
This is a nice way to see a town actually,

20:29.895 --> 20:32.648
but you can't look around too much,
you gotta pay attention.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.859
-Now we cry together "ohi, ohi," okay?
-[Phil] Yes. Ohi, ohi?

20:35.943 --> 20:38.153
-Okay.
-[Anna] One, two, three, go!

20:38.237 --> 20:39.613
[both] Ohi, ohi!

20:40.864 --> 20:42.991
You are speaking
the language of my family.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.409
-Really? [chuckles]
-Yeah.

20:47.037 --> 20:49.289
[Phil] Okay, so I
barely got the hang of that.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.751
Then we go out into open water.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.087
[horn blares]

20:56.505 --> 20:58.173
[Anna] This is your first adventure.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.884
-[Phil] Yes, it's a big adventure for me.
-[Anna laughs]

21:00.968 --> 21:02.844
And what's out there? Waves!

21:04.388 --> 21:06.265
The wake of other bigger boats.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.016
[siren blares]

21:08.100 --> 21:09.393
[Phil] Sure that's not for me?

21:09.726 --> 21:12.729
[Anna] Yes! Row, row! Come on! Push, push!

21:13.272 --> 21:15.857
I'm beyond shvitzing. It's now chaloshing.

21:15.941 --> 21:19.486
Chaloshing means
roasting in one's own juices.

21:19.569 --> 21:20.654
That's what I'm doing.

21:20.737 --> 21:23.156
-[Anna] Good job. Push! Push!
-Why does my back hurts so much?

21:23.240 --> 21:25.325
Yoo-hoo! Bravo, Philip!

21:26.076 --> 21:29.371
[Phil] Bravo, Philip.
Can we just row right to the hospital?

21:30.205 --> 21:31.540
-[Anna] It's a dance!
-[Phil] What?

21:31.623 --> 21:33.333
This is the world's worst dance.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.086
Bravo, Philip! Yoo-hoo!

21:36.169 --> 21:39.715
We crossed the channel! Yes! [chuckles]

21:40.716 --> 21:46.096
When I just think I have the hang of this,
and I'm near death, she says...

21:46.179 --> 21:49.308
[Anna] Okay, we try to row on the back.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.727
"It's a little harder,
but I think you're ready."

21:51.810 --> 21:53.437
No, Anna, I'm not ready.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.440
Standing on the top, no seat.

21:56.690 --> 21:57.524
I know.

21:57.774 --> 22:00.485
-Give me your phone and money, please.
-Here we go.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.445
[laughs]

22:01.528 --> 22:03.447
-Just in case.
-You're serious.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.325
-Mm. Yes.
-I knew this was a scam.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.536
Oh, goodbye, everybody.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.913
No, no problem. Wow!

22:12.331 --> 22:14.374
Wow, you're very easily impressed.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.002
[Anna] I go to help you in front.

22:20.005 --> 22:20.839
Like this.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.925
Hey! Hey!

22:24.009 --> 22:26.178
[Phil] I can't put it all together...

22:26.887 --> 22:29.556
with the oar lock and the stroke

22:29.639 --> 22:32.601
and the go up and twist your hand...

22:32.684 --> 22:34.061
and now push.

22:36.438 --> 22:37.481
[Anna] And stand.

22:37.564 --> 22:40.442
You are a noble gondolier now, not slave!

22:40.525 --> 22:43.653
Why not just throw me overboard
and get this over with?

22:44.112 --> 22:46.740
Just have sharks come and just finish.

22:48.075 --> 22:52.162
Before I sink us both, Anna saves herself
and sends me back to the front.

22:52.662 --> 22:53.497
[Phil] All right.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.624
-[Anna] All right, come on.
-[Phil] We're ending soon,

22:55.707 --> 22:58.085
or I'm gonna live
on that island with a volleyball.

22:58.335 --> 22:59.169
Push.

23:00.754 --> 23:01.713
Push. [chuckles]

23:04.966 --> 23:06.009
[Anna] Bravo, Philip!

23:06.093 --> 23:06.927
[Anna chuckles]

23:07.010 --> 23:08.804
[sighs]

23:08.887 --> 23:10.013
Molto bravo.

23:11.014 --> 23:12.015
[Anna] Very hard.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.062
[Phil] This was
one of the hardest things I've ever done.

23:18.188 --> 23:22.025
I don't have the intellectual capacity,
I don't have the stamina for this.

23:22.609 --> 23:25.153
Now when I see a gondolier...

23:27.030 --> 23:28.073
Respect.

23:30.951 --> 23:31.785
By the way...

23:34.162 --> 23:35.080
I got a blister.

23:36.331 --> 23:37.207
That's right.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.543
That's right. Blister.

23:49.511 --> 23:50.554
[Phil] Know what's nice?

23:51.346 --> 23:52.472
A boat with a motor.

23:53.014 --> 23:56.476
Plus, I'm here with my new friend,
Luca Marchiori,

23:57.394 --> 24:01.356
who is a great food writer,
and he's an historian.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.775
Even though his family moved to London,

24:03.859 --> 24:08.196
he was born in Italy to a father with
Venetian roots that go back to the 1700s.

24:08.363 --> 24:10.115
So, he's Venice through and through,

24:10.198 --> 24:12.033
and he's a great guide to the city.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.038
You know, when it's raining in Venice,

24:17.122 --> 24:22.335
the tide rises and so the boat
gets closer to the bridge.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.296
So you make adjustments.

24:34.347 --> 24:37.142
Let me ask you. How long have you
had this flooding problem?

24:37.225 --> 24:38.059
[chuckles]

24:38.143 --> 24:39.102
Hmm.

24:41.563 --> 24:42.898
[Phil] Our head still on our body,

24:42.981 --> 24:45.484
we're off
to Luca's favorite coffee roastery,

24:45.567 --> 24:49.070
Torrefazione Cannaregio,
for something warm.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.533
-Oh, that's nice.
-Mm-hmm.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.829
[Luca] I mean,
Italy is associated with coffee,

24:57.913 --> 25:00.248
and there's
a really strong coffee culture here.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.335
But not a lot of people know
it actually started here in Venice,

25:04.169 --> 25:09.424
because the coffee bean was brought
from Istanbul in about the 1570s

25:09.508 --> 25:11.468
and then it spread to the rest of Italy,

25:11.551 --> 25:14.262
so the Venetians are very proud
it started here in Venice.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.265
I think the rest of the world
is trying to catch up now

25:17.349 --> 25:18.850
-to Italian coffee.
-I think so, too.

25:22.354 --> 25:26.441
[Phil] Here's what I need to know.
How long before people realized, "Hey...

25:26.942 --> 25:32.948
This is magical, people will come and pay
money to be tourists in our place"?

25:33.073 --> 25:35.367
By the 13th, 14th century,
Venice was famous--

25:35.450 --> 25:38.119
as famous for being a beautiful city

25:38.203 --> 25:40.622
as it was for being
the center of European commerce.

25:40.705 --> 25:44.084
-Okay, so 700 years of tourism.
-[Luca] Exactly.

25:44.167 --> 25:46.127
-Because the city was so rich...
-[Phil] Yeah.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.046
...and such
a successful trading post,

25:48.129 --> 25:50.423
people started
spending money on buildings.

25:50.757 --> 25:55.178
There were laws to say Venetian people
couldn't spend money on rich clothes.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.766
And so they spent money on paintings,
buildings, the churches.

25:59.849 --> 26:03.353
So Venice quickly became
this beautiful art city.

26:04.020 --> 26:07.566
I love the history
because it's the most fascinating.

26:07.649 --> 26:08.775
So now, I want to ask you,

26:08.858 --> 26:12.946
I've read about how Venice is sinking

26:13.029 --> 26:16.658
and it's being destroyed by the very
tourists who want to come and see it.

26:16.741 --> 26:19.744
And I see with my own eyes,
the cruise ships coming in.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.165
-[Phil] It's another kind of invasion.
-[Luca] Yeah.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.254
The routes that the cruise ships take
to come in and out of the lagoon,

26:29.337 --> 26:32.132
they're going far too close
to the buildings--

26:32.215 --> 26:33.592
-I felt it.
-Ground shaking.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.344
-Four in the morning I felt a vibration.
-Yeah.

26:36.803 --> 26:40.265
And I look,
and a city is coming into your city.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.975
And tell me if this is correct.

26:42.267 --> 26:46.021
It's not like you're getting the business,
the hotel is getting the business.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.647
They sleep and eat on the boat.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.357
Exactly. Yes.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.860
-It's hit-and-run tourism.
-[Luca] Hit-and-run tourism, yeah.

26:59.909 --> 27:03.288
[Phil] Later that afternoon, I'm off
to a local place that doesn't benefit

27:03.371 --> 27:05.290
from that kind of hit-and-run tourism.

27:07.208 --> 27:09.294
A couple years ago, I was turned on to

27:09.377 --> 27:11.546
what I think
is the best restaurant in Venice.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.716
Al Covo's just a short walk
from the Piazza San Marco,

27:14.799 --> 27:16.509
and you'd never know you're near it.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.262
-[woman] You're here!
-[man] Buongiorno!

27:19.554 --> 27:22.182
-Buongiorno!
-Lots of hellos!

27:22.265 --> 27:23.308
Ciao, Phil.

27:23.391 --> 27:27.062
[Phil] And I just love the family
that runs it. Here's Cesare from Venice

27:27.145 --> 27:29.898
and his wife Diane,
who is originally from Austin, Texas,

27:30.023 --> 27:32.525
their son Lorenzo
and his girlfriend, Tiziana.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.653
They're squeezing me in
for a family lunch.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.321
-We hope you're hungry.
-I'm a little.

27:36.404 --> 27:37.364
[Diane laughs]

27:38.114 --> 27:39.407
[waiter] Your first course.

27:39.491 --> 27:43.161
It's a mix of boiled baby shrimps
and boiled mantis shrimps.

27:43.244 --> 27:45.121
Thank you. What a treat.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.000
[Phil] Oh. Wow.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.586
[Phil] Wow, that's good.

27:51.670 --> 27:56.800
This kind of fish, the local fish,
is getting more difficult to get.

27:57.050 --> 27:58.301
-It is? Why?
-Yeah.

27:59.135 --> 27:59.969
Overfishing.

28:01.471 --> 28:04.224
Damn. Venice is almost over everything.

28:04.307 --> 28:05.141
[Lorenzo] Yeah.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.393
-[Phil] Right?
-[Cesare] Yeah.

28:06.476 --> 28:10.146
Tourism is a resource,
not the tourism that we have now.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.648
They take a selfie, go away.

28:11.731 --> 28:14.526
Phil, it's a paradox,
but the city doesn't make money.

28:14.901 --> 28:18.238
[Tiziana] I think
that Venice looks so incredible

28:18.321 --> 28:21.449
that you don't think you're
inside a real city in which people live.

28:21.533 --> 28:26.121
It's true. Because in some ways,
it feels like a Disneyland experience.

28:26.204 --> 28:27.038
Yeah.

28:27.122 --> 28:30.417
I mean many times I'm asked,
"Do people actually live in Venice?"

28:30.500 --> 28:32.085
Or "What time does Venice close?"

28:32.711 --> 28:33.545
I kid you not.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.630
-It really happened.
-That's hilarious.

28:36.673 --> 28:37.757
Cheers.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.300
-Oh.
-Phil, here we are.

28:39.384 --> 28:40.760
Ah.

28:41.302 --> 28:42.929
[Phil] This is spider crab.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.431
With pasta.

28:45.306 --> 28:46.891
This smells amazing.

28:50.019 --> 28:53.565
The restaurants have gotten
so much better, I think, in Venice,

28:53.815 --> 28:55.150
thanks to people like you.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.862
There's a few now that are as good
as anywhere in Italy, I think.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.030
Although, they open, um...

29:02.824 --> 29:06.035
hundreds of small... things,

29:06.119 --> 29:08.163
they look like--
They're not so good.

29:08.246 --> 29:11.374
They actually don't have the kitchen

29:11.458 --> 29:13.001
and they don't have the chef.

29:13.251 --> 29:15.003
-It's all pre-cooked.
-Oh.

29:15.086 --> 29:17.964
-It's pre-cooked cuisines.
-How does a tourist know?

29:18.047 --> 29:20.175
-If they see a kitchen.
-[Diane] A jacket, a chef hat.

29:20.258 --> 29:22.427
A jacket, some fires, some oven.

29:22.510 --> 29:24.471
-These places don't--
-You'd never think to ask.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.598
Exactly. But that's the way it is.

29:27.348 --> 29:29.809
Look how beautiful this is!
What am I eating here?

29:29.893 --> 29:32.145
-This is a beautiful--
-[Cesare] This is Adriatic sole.

29:32.228 --> 29:34.314
-[Phil] My goodness.
-[Cesare] Sole de la Gentile.

29:34.397 --> 29:37.066
-Gentle sole.
-[Phil] Gentle soul, that's you!

29:43.072 --> 29:46.075
So what do the young folks think
we should do about Venice?

29:46.159 --> 29:49.370
What do you think would help
return it to what you want it to be?

29:49.454 --> 29:52.332
You got to make Venice livable
for the people, I mean...

29:52.415 --> 29:55.543
-Young people go away--
-They have to get a job somewhere else.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.796
This is the tragedy. It's a tragedy.

29:57.879 --> 30:00.965
When you lose Venetians, you lose culture.
You lose everything.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.426
Then there'll be nothing
for the tourist to come and see.

30:03.510 --> 30:04.344
[Lorenzo] Exactly.

30:06.221 --> 30:09.474
-When I walk at night, the light, color...
-[Diane] The sunset.

30:09.557 --> 30:12.268
...the shops, the age of the buildings,

30:12.352 --> 30:14.103
it's a painting everywhere you look.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.897
There's this one sweet moment...

30:16.356 --> 30:18.399
...when you walk back home late at night.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.861
Maybe it's the party,
maybe it's the, you know, the wine,

30:21.945 --> 30:25.990
but there's a sweet moment
when you think you own this

30:26.157 --> 30:27.867
and you feel you're really part of it.

30:28.409 --> 30:31.287
To preserving your pleasure!
Let's preserve pleasure.

30:31.371 --> 30:34.332
Let's preserve pleasure,
for heaven's sake! [chuckles]

30:58.106 --> 31:00.441
Not so bad. Not so bad.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.917
[Phil] You can't beat Venice,
but you shouldn't leave Italy

31:18.001 --> 31:20.503
without visiting
some of the smaller cities nearby.

31:21.421 --> 31:26.342
Just do a little research on your phone
and find out about the towns,

31:26.593 --> 31:30.054
because even if they have
one or two little attractions,

31:30.847 --> 31:35.435
they're far less crowded
and it's still Italy. Right?

31:35.768 --> 31:39.272
And you know what I say. Italy wins.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.317
Just a couple hours drive from Venice

31:42.400 --> 31:45.820
and you're in the exquisite,
ancient city of Modena.

31:46.613 --> 31:50.116
I met a new friend who taught me all
I need to know about this amazing place.

31:50.783 --> 31:54.245
Caterina Schenetti is a food expert.

31:54.329 --> 31:55.580
She gives food tours.

31:57.165 --> 32:01.294
Today she's showing me around
the oldest market, the Mercado Albinelli.

32:01.377 --> 32:05.632
This is
this darling, little beautiful market.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.133
Look at the treats!

32:12.931 --> 32:15.558
And it's also
one of the best places to get...

32:15.642 --> 32:16.517
Parmigiano.

32:17.894 --> 32:19.979
-[Phil] My favorite.
-[Caterina] You can't miss it.

32:20.063 --> 32:21.689
[Phil] And it's from this area?

32:21.773 --> 32:25.193
Yeah. Also, if you go a little bit
up north, a little bit up south,

32:25.735 --> 32:27.278
-that's not parmigiano. No way.
-No good.

32:27.362 --> 32:29.906
-And it's restricted by the government.
-Yes. Yes.

32:29.989 --> 32:31.908
-You guys have great rules.
-[chuckles]

32:32.825 --> 32:34.702
[Caterina] First,
we are trying the fresco.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.705
[Phil] Fresco parmigiano is aged one year.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.415
That's the youngest you can get.

32:39.499 --> 32:42.877
From this moment, we can start to call
the cheese parmigiano reggiano.

32:44.128 --> 32:44.963
Grazie.

32:47.340 --> 32:48.299
Nice.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.884
Venti quattro mesi?

32:50.927 --> 32:52.804
[Phil]
Next, here's the two-year-old cheese.

32:52.887 --> 32:55.264
Look, so you start to see the crystals.

32:56.307 --> 32:57.141
[Phil] You see it?

32:59.435 --> 33:02.397
Basically, more it's aged,
more you can feel this crystal.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.606
Is there an older one?

33:04.148 --> 33:06.985
-A very special one, six years old.
-What?

33:09.278 --> 33:10.321
[Phil] It's gonna kill me.

33:10.405 --> 33:11.489
[Caterina chuckles]

33:13.783 --> 33:14.617
[Phil] Grazie.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.246
Oh.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.497
We have lost it.

33:19.580 --> 33:22.208
-[man speaks Italian]
-[Caterina laughs]

33:22.291 --> 33:24.377
[Phil] Well, it's very old.
I have to be delicate.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.796
-Like with me, you should be delicate.
-Yes.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.257
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

33:34.095 --> 33:35.013
Oh.

33:36.806 --> 33:39.684
You taste
completely different flavors now.

33:40.810 --> 33:41.811
It's almost sweet.

33:42.103 --> 33:45.231
Yeah, and you can see also
the color was changing a lot.

33:45.314 --> 33:46.899
The consistency is different.

33:47.233 --> 33:48.276
That's really good.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.532
[Richard] I ate it off the floor. [laughs]

33:56.284 --> 33:58.578
[Phil] Why when we get parmigiano reggiano

33:58.661 --> 34:01.789
is it somewhat dry and crumbly
in the United States?

34:02.331 --> 34:04.876
I want you to go to Italy

34:04.959 --> 34:08.629
and get a vacuum-sealed thing
of parmigiano reggiano.

34:08.713 --> 34:09.797
Put it in your suitcase,

34:10.131 --> 34:13.926
because you're gonna find that it
tastes much different from the source.

34:14.594 --> 34:15.845
It's phenomenal.

34:15.928 --> 34:18.014
-[Phil] Bellissima!
-Grazie. Grazie.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.810
[Phil] Caterina knows a lot
about a lot of things,

34:22.894 --> 34:26.314
but she specializes in balsamic vinegar.

34:26.397 --> 34:29.442
You've seen the label,
balsamic vinegar of Modena.

34:29.525 --> 34:30.693
Yes! We're in Modena!

34:30.777 --> 34:32.403
-[Caterina] Andiamo!
-[Phil] Andiamo!

34:32.945 --> 34:34.238
[Phil] Off to taste vinegar.

34:34.405 --> 34:35.323
And on the way...

34:35.615 --> 34:36.824
[Caterina] See the cathedral.

34:37.200 --> 34:40.578
The first stone was put on in 1099.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.038
-Amazing.
-You can imagine.

34:42.580 --> 34:46.709
Our cathedral,
it is also called The Stone Book.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.045
[Phil] So you tell
the story with pictures.

34:49.128 --> 34:50.129
[Caterina] Yes.

34:50.630 --> 34:51.964
So you see this one here?

34:52.381 --> 34:56.219
This is when I taught my brother
to play baseball.

34:56.302 --> 34:57.386
[laughs]

34:57.470 --> 34:59.347
Well, I don't know if that one was the...

34:59.430 --> 35:02.266
-He got very angry. This is what he does.
-...proper interpretation.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.601
[Phil] It's a good likeness.

35:05.436 --> 35:09.941
[Caterina] So let's cross here to see the
traditional balsamic vinegar of Modena.

35:10.358 --> 35:11.192
[Phil] Here we go.

35:12.902 --> 35:15.822
[Phil] This is where you get
the official balsamic vinegar.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.324
Even the shape of the bottle is regulated.

35:18.699 --> 35:20.201
Right? It has to be this shape.

35:20.284 --> 35:23.204
It has to have this number on it.
It has to have this label on it.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.747
You know, it's pretty official.

35:25.164 --> 35:28.709
The bottle was designed
by Giugiaro, car designer.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.294
This is what you want to look for.

35:30.378 --> 35:31.796
If it's traditional...

35:31.879 --> 35:33.089
Has to be this shape.

35:33.172 --> 35:34.132
Has to be this shape.

35:34.715 --> 35:36.968
[Phil] Not all regulation
is terrible. Right?

35:37.093 --> 35:40.096
This is to ensure quality.

35:40.847 --> 35:44.058
This is aged at least 12 years.

35:46.144 --> 35:50.690
-You should smell first and then taste.
-[Phil] Wow.

35:56.445 --> 35:59.782
I'm telling you,
they put a drop on this spoon...

36:01.784 --> 36:07.290
and an explosion
of sweet and pungent and sour,

36:07.373 --> 36:10.293
but so intense, so concentrated.

36:11.127 --> 36:13.462
And then I have the 25-year,

36:13.546 --> 36:15.965
and that's like a whole other level.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.095
You shouldn't even call it vinegar.

36:21.179 --> 36:25.266
You should call it ha-hoo ba-dow dee-dow.

36:25.349 --> 36:27.476
I bought both. Had to buy both.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.354
Oh.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.315
[Phil] They then come
from the ice cream place,

36:32.398 --> 36:34.609
the beautiful gelato store next door.

36:35.234 --> 36:38.654
And they come with a flavor
called fiore de latte, right?

36:38.738 --> 36:40.531
Flower of milk.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.533
Isn't that a nice name for something?

36:43.201 --> 36:44.702
-I'm so happy!
-We should have

36:44.785 --> 36:48.289
-the cherry wood vinegar on top.
-[Phil gasps] Wait a minute.

36:49.790 --> 36:52.460
[Phil] And they drizzle
a little of this balsamic vinegar.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.880
You already know this is gonna be good.

37:02.678 --> 37:03.512
This is-- Okay.

37:03.596 --> 37:06.432
This is automatically
one of the world's great desserts.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.518
You have this every day. You have a face--

37:09.602 --> 37:11.938
You the have the face of,
"Yeah, we have it every day."

37:12.021 --> 37:12.897
[all chuckle]

37:13.981 --> 37:15.441
[Phil] It's such a perfect combo.

37:16.567 --> 37:20.696
And yet, as much as I love that,
I think what I'm gonna do now,

37:20.780 --> 37:22.073
if you come over to my house,

37:22.490 --> 37:24.700
whatever we eat, I'm gonna finish the meal

37:24.909 --> 37:29.538
with a drop of this
because you're not gonna eat anything

37:29.622 --> 37:32.875
that has more flavor than one drop
of this, like they call it, liquid gold.

37:33.668 --> 37:35.503
Get the good stuff. It's worth it.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.474
[Phil] Catarina has
one more stop in mind...

37:49.100 --> 37:53.271
and even though it's midday, I've been
promised the perfect Modena breakfast.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.315
We meet her friend Andrea
at a place called Bar Tiffany.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.734
And we have breakfast at Tiffany's.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.529
-Buongiorno!
-Buongiorno!

38:01.612 --> 38:03.239
-Un gnocco fritto.
-[Caterina] Grazie!

38:03.322 --> 38:06.534
È viva. So you take your cappuccino,

38:06.617 --> 38:09.453
and you dip into the gnocco fritto.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.706
So this is
a Modena donuts and coffee, right?

38:11.789 --> 38:13.791
-[Caterina chuckles]
-[Andrea] Yeah, basically.

38:15.126 --> 38:21.966
It's a kind of lightly fried,
puffy, hot pillow of dough

38:22.049 --> 38:24.010
called a gnocco fritto.

38:26.095 --> 38:27.471
Mm.

38:29.181 --> 38:31.559
[Phil] Wow. It's very light.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.102
[Caterina] Yeah. Super light.

38:33.185 --> 38:34.020
[Phil] Mostly air.

38:35.479 --> 38:36.564
Mm.

38:37.940 --> 38:40.401
How can I live without gnocco fritto?
[chuckles]

38:40.484 --> 38:42.486
-[Andrea] Do you know how it's made?
-No!

38:42.570 --> 38:45.406
[Andrea] The gnocco fritto.
It's zero zero flour

38:45.823 --> 38:49.535
with some pig lard because in Modena...

38:50.036 --> 38:51.245
-Strutto.
-...it's everywhere.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.955
-Strutto.
-Strutto.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.624
-That's the fat of the pig?
-[Andrea and Caterina] Yes.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.668
Makes everything a little better,
doesn't it?

38:57.752 --> 38:58.836
-[Caterina and Andrea] Yes.

38:59.670 --> 39:03.049
-And then they fry it... in strutto.
-In strutto.

39:03.132 --> 39:04.592
-[Phil] More.
-[Andrea] What else?

39:04.675 --> 39:05.509
[Caterina] Strutto.

39:06.427 --> 39:11.140
Maybe I should just put strutto
all over me and I will be better, too.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.729
[Andrea] You can find this one
just in the area of Modena.

39:16.979 --> 39:18.898
Like many other Italian products,

39:18.981 --> 39:22.568
if you move from a few kilometers
from one town to the other,

39:22.735 --> 39:25.404
maybe they change the name,
they change the recipe.

39:25.488 --> 39:27.990
And that's what happened for this one.

39:28.074 --> 39:32.411
I like that the products of the area
come to define the area.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.372
-Yeah, this is true.
-Right?

39:34.455 --> 39:35.289
Okay.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.625
I'm gonna call Antonio to fry another one.

39:40.503 --> 39:43.214
[Phil] And we move from breakfast
straight into lunch.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.051
-This is a small gnocchi with mortadella.
-[Phil] Nice.

39:47.134 --> 39:49.261
-With salami.
-Nice.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.764
-And with raw prosciutto.
-Nicest.

39:52.098 --> 39:53.682
-Prego.
-Grazie.

39:54.642 --> 39:57.103
[Phil] Oh, it's warm.
That's what you want.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.939
Yes, this is a ham sandwich now.

40:00.731 --> 40:05.694
The fat starts to melt
because it's hot and a little crispy,

40:07.238 --> 40:08.823
and that's a very good thing.

40:10.157 --> 40:11.534
[Caterina chuckles]

40:12.910 --> 40:13.911
Mm.

40:13.994 --> 40:15.913
[Phil] Wow.

40:15.996 --> 40:19.583
It's like a ham on a croissant,
but Italian style.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.086
-[Andrea] And fried.
-[Caterina] And fried and hot.

40:22.628 --> 40:25.423
Yeah... so better is what you're saying.

40:25.506 --> 40:27.133
[laughs]

40:35.141 --> 40:36.434
[Phil] Now I can't lie to you.

40:36.725 --> 40:40.020
The main reason
you've even heard of Modena

40:40.104 --> 40:44.191
is because there's a guy there
named Massimo Bottura.

40:45.109 --> 40:50.114
His Osteria Francescana has been voted
the number one restaurant in the world,

40:50.197 --> 40:52.324
and I get to spend the day with Massimo.

40:53.742 --> 40:57.746
I show up at his apartment.
First one I meet is Luna.

40:58.164 --> 41:00.583
Look at this puppy. Look at the puppy.

41:00.666 --> 41:04.170
And then I meet his wife, Lara,
who's American.

41:04.712 --> 41:07.256
-[Lara] Come on in.
-And they invite me in for coffee.

41:08.257 --> 41:10.426
-Massimo! Phil!
-Hi, Phil!

41:10.843 --> 41:13.679
Oh, the amaretti! Ciao.

41:14.180 --> 41:15.389
I heard you like these.

41:15.681 --> 41:17.224
-I love the amaretti.
-Oh, good.

41:19.268 --> 41:20.352
[Massimo] You see?

41:20.436 --> 41:22.480
You see how soft the inside are?

41:22.563 --> 41:25.149
-Yes, I do.
-And then this part is like-- Try.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.485
-You want some coffee?
-Yes.

41:27.568 --> 41:30.196
-Can't talk without coffee in the morning.
-Me too.

41:30.946 --> 41:32.865
[Phil] Besides running
the best restaurant,

41:32.948 --> 41:35.201
he and Lara created Food For Soul,

41:35.576 --> 41:39.121
an international group committed
to revolutionizing the soup kitchen.

41:40.289 --> 41:42.291
He's trying to create a community,

41:42.500 --> 41:46.003
and it's not just once on Thanksgiving,
once on Christmas.

41:46.086 --> 41:47.046
It's every week.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.674
And the people they serve
start making human connections.

41:50.758 --> 41:54.637
If you serve a hundred people well,
you greet them by name...

41:54.720 --> 41:56.430
-Yes.
-...your volunteers know who they are,

41:56.514 --> 41:59.225
you're serving them
a delicious and healthy meal,

41:59.892 --> 42:02.645
sometimes that's better
than serving a thousand people

42:02.770 --> 42:06.106
a sandwich thrown at them, because there's
actual possibility for change.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.775
-You make a family!
-[Massimo] Absolutely!

42:07.858 --> 42:08.776
Family.

42:09.276 --> 42:12.613
We build the dignity of the people.
That's why I want artists,

42:12.696 --> 42:17.826
designers, architects
to rebuild the beautiful space.

42:18.702 --> 42:19.662
Come with me!

42:19.745 --> 42:22.831
[Phil] I think Massimo doesn't wanna
just tell me about the soup kitchen.

42:22.915 --> 42:24.708
You driving the Maserati with me?

42:25.251 --> 42:28.128
-Are we doing that now?
-Ever driven with an Italian chef?

42:28.212 --> 42:29.463
-No.
-In a fast car?

42:29.547 --> 42:30.923
-No.
-Be warned.

42:35.511 --> 42:37.638
But he wasn't driving very fast.

42:38.180 --> 42:41.725
So, you were just teasing me
that you drive fast? You don't drive fast.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.978
That was a stupid thing to say.

42:53.779 --> 42:55.072
Oh, oh.

43:05.666 --> 43:07.918
-[Phil] Thank God we're here.
-[both chuckle]

43:09.962 --> 43:12.673
[Phil] This beautiful space
serves Modena's most needy.

43:13.632 --> 43:16.677
It's not some soup kitchen
where you grab some sustenance

43:16.760 --> 43:18.429
and back to wherever you're going.

43:19.680 --> 43:20.973
You feel somewhere special.

43:21.557 --> 43:24.059
These are the darkness, the north.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.645
They want blood. Look at them.

43:27.062 --> 43:30.733
It's like Game of Thrones, you know?
It's like... [growls]

43:35.112 --> 43:40.200
And why art has to be
just for rich people? No!

43:40.284 --> 43:42.536
Art has to be for everyone.

43:42.620 --> 43:47.374
That's why Food For Soul is helping
artists to do these kind of projects.

43:47.458 --> 43:48.292
You know?

43:49.209 --> 43:50.169
Let's go!

43:54.965 --> 43:56.675
[Phil] In the back of my mind,
I must admit

43:57.259 --> 43:59.178
I was like, "Are we gonna eat?

43:59.845 --> 44:01.722
Are we gonna get to go to the restaurant?"

44:02.389 --> 44:04.767
-We stop for espresso.
-[Phil] Nope.

44:05.601 --> 44:07.269
-Like big shot.
-Big shot.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.524
[Massimo] This way.

44:18.030 --> 44:19.865
[Phil] Maybe the next stop
is his restaurant?

44:24.703 --> 44:25.913
And then we're here!

44:26.372 --> 44:27.289
Ciao.

44:27.956 --> 44:29.958
-And I get to meet some of the crew.
-Hi.

44:31.251 --> 44:32.252
And now I'm hungry.

44:32.753 --> 44:35.798
-You're hungry. All right! [chuckles]
-I came to the right place.

44:37.633 --> 44:40.344
Let's go have a sandwich.
Let's have a sandwich.

44:41.220 --> 44:42.179
Let's go this way.

44:44.056 --> 44:45.349
[laughs]

44:49.311 --> 44:51.063
-Lambrusco.
-I love meeting you.

44:51.855 --> 44:54.149
-Thank you.
-You're my favorite new person.

44:54.233 --> 44:55.818
[chuckles]

44:55.901 --> 44:57.736
Lambrusco and mortadella.

44:57.820 --> 44:59.154
There it is! King of cheese!

44:59.238 --> 45:02.074
-There it is. King of the cheese.
-And how old is this guy?

45:02.324 --> 45:03.617
[Massimo] Two years, I think.

45:07.204 --> 45:09.039
It doesn't taste like this at home.

45:09.415 --> 45:10.457
Come on!

45:10.541 --> 45:12.418
-Really. It's true.
-Don't say that.

45:13.210 --> 45:17.923
It's a perfect mixture
between acidity, sapidity, bitterness,

45:18.006 --> 45:20.467
-sweetness in one little chunk.
-It's true.

45:22.553 --> 45:24.138
There is nothing wrong with that.

45:24.221 --> 45:25.639
-Yeah.
-Right?

45:25.723 --> 45:27.808
Do you want to explore the restaurant?

45:28.767 --> 45:29.601
Nah!

45:29.685 --> 45:31.061
No? Let's stay here?

45:31.145 --> 45:35.190
-Okay, I like panino! Panino forever!
-I like it here. I like a sandwich.

45:36.066 --> 45:38.610
Okay. We'll see
your little place you got there.

45:38.694 --> 45:40.529
-Let's see that--
-Let's walk in.

45:45.492 --> 45:46.410
[knocking]

45:46.493 --> 45:47.828
[Phil] Hello.

45:47.911 --> 45:49.913
-[Massimo] Hi, guys.
-[Phil] Hello! Oh!

45:49.997 --> 45:51.999
-Hi, guys.
-Wow! I am underdressed!

45:52.082 --> 45:52.958
[Massimo] Welcome.

45:53.041 --> 45:54.668
[Phil] I'm not going
to the dining room.

45:54.752 --> 45:57.963
He's taking me to the kitchen
where I get to watch the making of.

45:58.046 --> 46:00.799
-[Phil] Oh.
-This is the kitchen.

46:02.009 --> 46:05.053
[Phil] I'm just hoping
some food falls off somebody's plate.

46:05.471 --> 46:09.475
[in Italian] Okay, guys. A table
with two people. Two super menu. Mazza!

46:09.558 --> 46:10.559
[all] Mazza!

46:13.395 --> 46:16.440
[Phil] First, Massimo wants
to show me his world famous dish,

46:16.523 --> 46:20.652
"five ages of parmigiano reggiano
in different textures and temperatures."

46:20.736 --> 46:22.029
Yes, that's the name.

46:22.112 --> 46:27.451
He's transformed parmesan
into soufflé, foam, sauce,

46:27.534 --> 46:30.746
frothy air, and a crunchy cracker.

46:31.371 --> 46:33.290
-[Massimo] We choose an ingredient...
-[Phil] Yes.

46:33.707 --> 46:35.501
-...and it's parmigiano reggiano.
-Yes.

46:35.584 --> 46:38.796
And we decide

46:38.879 --> 46:42.841
it's the way we want to express

46:43.801 --> 46:45.677
the slowly aging process.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.013
-Gonna taste that.
-[Phil] For me?

46:48.472 --> 46:50.682
-[Massimo] his is yours.
-Yes.

46:51.934 --> 46:53.060
Yes!

46:53.936 --> 46:54.895
[Massimo] Come on.

46:59.525 --> 47:00.359
That's good!

47:03.320 --> 47:04.321
Mm!

47:07.491 --> 47:11.787
Okay so, this is a sea salad. Okay?

47:11.870 --> 47:15.707
-Oyster, squid, some ink of the squid.
-[Phil] Yes.

47:15.791 --> 47:18.252
[Massimo] This is calamari.
This is seaweed.

47:18.335 --> 47:21.547
This is a leaf, a crunchy leaf...

47:21.630 --> 47:22.464
[Phil] Yes.

47:22.548 --> 47:24.091
...that is made with mussels.

47:25.843 --> 47:28.762
[Phil] This tiny mussel chip
takes a week to make.

47:29.888 --> 47:31.557
I think I can eat it a little faster.

47:31.890 --> 47:33.475
When this arrives on the plate...

47:33.559 --> 47:35.394
Yeah. Yeah. It's a salad.

47:35.477 --> 47:36.562
-We don't know the story.

47:36.645 --> 47:42.359
There are two very important words
in our flag of Modena.

47:42.985 --> 47:45.612
It's avia pervia.

47:45.779 --> 47:48.824
Latin word. "Make look simple
the very complicated thing."

47:49.741 --> 47:51.410
Everything looks so simple.

47:51.493 --> 47:52.911
I have to build a car.

47:53.036 --> 47:54.830
We build Ferrari, Maserati.

47:55.455 --> 47:57.165
I need vinegar to dress my salad.

47:57.249 --> 47:58.542
We build balsamic vinegar.

47:58.625 --> 48:00.002
It's always been like that.

48:00.085 --> 48:01.211
That's the art.

48:01.295 --> 48:02.129
[Massimo] It is.

48:03.797 --> 48:05.465
-Please, enjoy!
-[Phil] Here I go.

48:05.757 --> 48:07.634
-Thank you, Massimo!
-You're welcome.

48:14.349 --> 48:15.559
[Phil] I'll taste it by itself.

48:19.855 --> 48:24.192
Wow, that's just a concentration
of mussels is what it tastes like.

48:26.987 --> 48:29.948
[Phil] I just felt so special.
These are working people.

48:30.032 --> 48:34.620
I'm some bum who got into the kitchen
and is eating their profits.

48:34.703 --> 48:35.996
[chuckles]

48:36.955 --> 48:39.416
This is really happening,
I'm getting the whole menu.

48:39.499 --> 48:42.836
Massimo told me no one's ever been allowed
to eat in the kitchen before.

48:46.381 --> 48:48.634
[Massimo] The next course
is gonna blow your mind.

48:50.010 --> 48:52.596
[Phil] Massimo is showing me
the traditional Italian fish dish

48:52.679 --> 48:54.473
that he uses for inspiration.

48:55.057 --> 48:57.517
-[Massimo] This is a sole en papillote.
-[Phil] Yes.

48:57.684 --> 49:00.395
-Very, very old style. Okay?
-Yeah.

49:00.479 --> 49:02.814
The same flavor you find here,

49:03.023 --> 49:07.527
-lemon, capers, black olives, tomato...
-[Phil] Yeah. Tomato.

49:07.611 --> 49:09.488
...you're gonna find in this plate.

49:10.197 --> 49:13.033
-[Phil] That's crazy!
-[Massimo] Yeah. Then, what we did.

49:14.826 --> 49:16.662
-This is seawater...
-Wow.

49:18.622 --> 49:21.249
...dehydrated and trans-- [laughs]

49:21.333 --> 49:22.834
And transformed into paper.

49:24.336 --> 49:26.880
And this here is an edible paper.

49:28.715 --> 49:30.133
But when you see this,

49:30.217 --> 49:32.427
it looks like almost like garbage,

49:32.844 --> 49:34.554
like the leftover from this dish.

49:35.222 --> 49:36.056
And you eat it.

49:41.353 --> 49:43.355
Massimo, I'm glad I came. [laughs]

49:43.438 --> 49:45.941
I hope so. I hope so.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.027
[Phil] If you have nice people outside
who traveled and waited years

49:49.111 --> 49:52.280
to come and eat here, dressed up nicely,
came from all over the world,

49:52.364 --> 49:55.617
if they knew that an animal was
in the kitchen eating their food,

49:55.867 --> 49:56.827
what would they say?

49:57.327 --> 50:01.039
They would say, "Enjoy! Enjoy!"

50:06.086 --> 50:08.422
[Phil] I'm standing there
in the kitchen for two hours.

50:08.505 --> 50:11.591
It's a young man's game,
I have to say, or a young woman's game.

50:11.675 --> 50:14.386
And you know my back
isn't great to begin with.

50:14.469 --> 50:17.431
And then Massimo gives me
some stretches to do.

50:17.514 --> 50:21.601
So I'm going like this,
and I'm stretching all these muscles.

50:21.685 --> 50:22.769
-This.
-[Massimo] Like this.

50:23.145 --> 50:25.564
-Another very good for the back.
-Yeah.

50:25.647 --> 50:29.234
You align this, 90 degrees, 90 degrees.

50:29.943 --> 50:32.821
Higher... and straight...

50:33.363 --> 50:34.573
and stay like that.

50:36.074 --> 50:37.617
-That's hard!
-Very hard.

50:38.410 --> 50:40.579
Very hard, but it's stretching so much.

50:41.121 --> 50:42.748
-That's good.
-It's very good.

50:42.831 --> 50:44.916
I just want to live near Massimo.

50:46.918 --> 50:48.128
[Massimo] This is a pigeon.

50:48.336 --> 50:51.048
[Phil] Pigeon. You didn't get these
from San Marco did you?

50:51.131 --> 50:52.549
[Massimo chuckles]

50:52.632 --> 50:57.262
We make the meatball with all
the interiors and the legs of the pigeon.

50:58.638 --> 51:00.766
We dehydrate all the sauces.

51:01.099 --> 51:02.684
And the sauces you see here,

51:02.768 --> 51:04.311
-you see here.
-[Phil] Are there.

51:04.394 --> 51:06.938
That's one
of the most beautiful, colorful dishes.

51:07.981 --> 51:09.816
-[Massimo] And the grand finale.
-[Phil] Yes.

51:09.900 --> 51:12.277
[Massimo] As we build a menu--
We build a menu as an opera.

51:12.986 --> 51:16.198
You have an overture, you have the adagio,

51:16.907 --> 51:20.285
you have the meno, then the minueto,

51:20.869 --> 51:22.996
then the allegro, then the grand finale.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.082
[opera music playing]

51:38.845 --> 51:40.555
[Phil] Wow, I should have been Italian.

51:41.640 --> 51:42.974
I curse my parents.

51:43.058 --> 51:44.101
[laughs]

51:45.227 --> 51:46.853
[Phil] What a special, special guy.

51:48.271 --> 51:50.565
He cares about the beautiful things,

51:51.274 --> 51:52.567
not just the food.

51:53.318 --> 51:55.237
The food is beautiful,
the place is beautiful.

51:56.488 --> 51:58.573
The art is beautiful, music is beautiful.

51:59.366 --> 52:00.242
Massimo Bottura.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.036
Beautiful.

52:03.870 --> 52:05.455
Mm.

52:24.975 --> 52:27.352
[skype ringing]

52:29.688 --> 52:31.898
-Hey!
-Oh! Hi!

52:32.524 --> 52:34.276
-[Helen] Hi. Hello.
-[Max] Hello.

52:35.277 --> 52:38.488
Venice is-- must be
the most beautiful country in the world.

52:38.572 --> 52:39.614
Beautiful city.

52:39.698 --> 52:40.740
City.

52:40.824 --> 52:42.993
It used to be a big empire.

52:43.660 --> 52:45.162
Listen, listen, listen.

52:45.245 --> 52:47.539
[man singing in Italian]

52:50.000 --> 52:51.084
-[Max] Can't.
-[Helen] I do.

52:51.168 --> 52:53.336
-What do you hear?
-Birds. Birds.

52:54.337 --> 52:56.965
I have to ask, what kind of birds
you have around your house?

52:57.507 --> 52:59.759
Well, it could be from the outside.

52:59.843 --> 53:03.930
It's definitely from the outside.
It's a gondolier who's going by singing.

53:04.764 --> 53:07.392
You mean, there's somebody
walking on the street singing?

53:07.475 --> 53:08.643
Gondolier!

53:09.060 --> 53:11.646
You know the streets are water. [laughs]

53:11.730 --> 53:14.691
-[Max] Oh, you're right. I see. Okay.
-Because I'm in Venice.

53:15.066 --> 53:17.527
Have you heard
about the street walker in Venice?

53:17.611 --> 53:18.528
No.

53:19.654 --> 53:20.947
She-- She drowned.

53:22.532 --> 53:25.285
So... that's the joke.

53:26.161 --> 53:27.871
I'm glad that people got to hear it.

53:27.954 --> 53:29.289
[Richard laughs]

53:30.457 --> 53:32.751
Did you hear I took a gondola lesson?

53:32.834 --> 53:35.337
It was excruciating. [laughs]

53:35.420 --> 53:40.258
I really--
The tension just to stay balanced,

53:40.342 --> 53:43.887
and the oar doesn't stay in the thing.
It keeps slipping out.

53:44.054 --> 53:46.348
And I'm gonna fall into the water,
I'm thinking.

53:46.890 --> 53:47.974
-I can't--
-Why not stopping?

53:48.683 --> 53:49.976
Because I'm on television.

53:50.393 --> 53:52.020
[Max laughs]

53:52.812 --> 53:55.065
Tell me, how was Modena?

53:55.148 --> 53:58.026
I understand the vinegar
is very good from there.

53:58.109 --> 53:58.944
I bought some.

53:59.027 --> 54:01.529
You just need a little bit,
and it's... [makes explosion sound]

54:02.906 --> 54:04.741
Beautiful. They even put on ice cream--

54:04.824 --> 54:08.495
Little drops on the ice cream.
It makes it fantastic.

54:08.578 --> 54:10.580
That-- That goes too far.

54:12.123 --> 54:13.667
I'll put it on a salad.

54:13.750 --> 54:14.584
[chuckles]

54:14.668 --> 54:15.710
[phone ringing]

54:16.461 --> 54:17.879
Oh, who's calling now?

54:19.422 --> 54:20.674
It's your wife.

54:20.757 --> 54:22.175
Oh.

54:22.259 --> 54:23.093
Monica.

54:23.551 --> 54:24.803
[Monica] Yes, hello!

54:24.886 --> 54:27.931
Hi. Listen. I'm just talking to Philip.

54:28.014 --> 54:30.141
[muffled speech]

54:34.562 --> 54:36.273
What did you say?

54:36.356 --> 54:39.651
Take you time! It's not like
we have a crew of 25 people here!

54:40.694 --> 54:45.156
He-- I don't know what he's eating,
but he's eating while he's talking to us.

54:45.240 --> 54:48.493
Little poison berries. [chuckles]

54:49.577 --> 54:50.787
Because I can't anymore.

54:50.870 --> 54:53.123
[muffled speech]

54:53.206 --> 54:56.209
-Okay, so you're going back to L.A.
-[Monica] Yeah.

54:57.502 --> 55:00.046
Right, I can go now.
They're gonna talk for an hour.

55:00.130 --> 55:01.798
-Oh, you're going tonight?
-Yeah.

55:01.881 --> 55:03.591
Oh, have a wonderful time.

55:09.180 --> 55:12.058
[Phil] Last time I was in Italy,
I made some great new friends,

55:12.267 --> 55:15.186
and tonight I'm having
a nice, quiet dinner with them.

55:15.270 --> 55:16.771
[horn tooting]

55:16.855 --> 55:18.648
[laughs]

55:18.732 --> 55:21.151
Dario Cecchini, the world' best butcher.

55:21.234 --> 55:22.068
Ciao.

55:22.777 --> 55:23.778
And his wife, Kim.

55:23.862 --> 55:25.947
Wow! All my favorite people.

55:26.656 --> 55:29.701
Silvana Vivoli,
maybe my favorite person in the world

55:29.784 --> 55:31.536
because she makes
the best gelato ever.

55:32.078 --> 55:33.538
-Jim!
-Nice to meet you, Phil.

55:33.663 --> 55:36.333
Dario and Kim brought a friend of theirs,

55:36.416 --> 55:39.544
who happens to be one of the best bakers
in the world from New York!

55:40.086 --> 55:41.963
Jim Lahey from Sullivan Street Bakery.

55:42.630 --> 55:44.382
So now I have a friend in New York.

55:45.342 --> 55:47.927
Never had a friend in New York
although I lived there half my life.

55:48.011 --> 55:48.887
Nobody liked me.

55:49.763 --> 55:54.100
You joined a nice party
of the best gelato maker in the world

55:54.184 --> 55:56.311
and the best butcher in the world.

55:56.394 --> 55:58.146
-Everything covered.
-Let me see your hands!

55:58.229 --> 56:01.066
These are the best hands in the world!
These hands!

56:01.274 --> 56:04.361
And by the way... not terrible.

56:04.861 --> 56:05.904
[Silvana laughs]

56:05.987 --> 56:06.821
[Phil] You like it?

56:07.405 --> 56:09.074
-Fabulous!
-[laughs]

56:09.157 --> 56:10.200
[Dario] Fabuloso!

56:14.204 --> 56:15.038
[Phil] Hello there.

56:15.121 --> 56:16.706
Wow!

56:16.790 --> 56:18.416
[Phil] You think I get excited
with food.

56:18.500 --> 56:20.293
I'm nothing next to him.

56:20.377 --> 56:22.420
He gets excited when the breadsticks come.

56:22.629 --> 56:23.963
Giovanni!

56:24.047 --> 56:25.173
[Phil laughs]

56:25.256 --> 56:26.174
Giovanni!

56:26.257 --> 56:29.094
-Giovanni!
-[Dario] Giovanni is the chef.

56:29.177 --> 56:30.387
-Giovanni!
-Buonasera!

56:30.470 --> 56:31.388
Buonasera!

56:33.223 --> 56:34.140
No, I hug.

56:34.224 --> 56:35.517
[both laughs]

56:35.600 --> 56:36.851
Okay.

56:36.935 --> 56:38.853
-How are you? Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

56:40.146 --> 56:41.272
[Phil] A beautiful meat pie.

56:43.691 --> 56:44.692
[Dario] Mamma mia.

56:45.652 --> 56:47.987
Can somebody tell me what the pie is?
The meat pie.

56:48.071 --> 56:50.698
-[Kim] There's mint. Maybe, there's lamb.
-[Phil] It's fantastic.

56:51.282 --> 56:53.868
[Dario] Mm.

56:53.952 --> 56:55.120
[laughs]

56:55.745 --> 56:56.746
[Phil] I love food.

56:56.830 --> 56:57.872
Me too.

56:57.956 --> 56:58.957
Me too!

56:59.582 --> 57:00.667
Otherwise, no show.

57:00.750 --> 57:02.961
[laughs] That's true.

57:03.753 --> 57:06.506
[all sing "Funiculì, Funiculà"]

57:17.600 --> 57:19.185
[Phil] No more wine for you or for you.

57:21.479 --> 57:23.523
[Phil] This is red chicory risotto.

57:24.023 --> 57:26.109
Bigoli pasta with anchovy sauce.

57:29.571 --> 57:31.990
Oh, my goodness! This is good. Huh?

57:32.073 --> 57:33.283
[Kim] Wait till you taste this.

57:33.950 --> 57:35.785
Oh! Oh!

57:36.870 --> 57:37.704
[Phil] Phil-te fish!

57:37.787 --> 57:39.038
I am very honored.

57:39.122 --> 57:40.707
You know he looks like me a little.

57:41.082 --> 57:43.376
If the nose was a little bigger,
it'd be perfect.

57:45.253 --> 57:48.047
[Phil] This is really sea bass
in a beautiful salt crust.

57:48.715 --> 57:50.967
Dover sole served with a chestnut soufflé.

57:52.177 --> 57:53.094
[Phil] You hungry?

57:53.178 --> 57:54.179
[Kim laughs]

57:54.262 --> 57:56.556
[growls]

57:56.639 --> 57:58.475
Hungry!

58:00.351 --> 58:02.812
-Grazie! Giovanni. Giovanni!
-Grazie, everybody!

58:03.521 --> 58:04.814
Buon appetito.

58:04.898 --> 58:07.692
[speaking Italian]

58:18.119 --> 58:19.704
[Phil] Look at the view.

58:20.830 --> 58:24.334
At one point, my brother said
it looked like I was green screen.

58:24.834 --> 58:28.963
There's no special effects here!
Venice is the special effect!

58:33.801 --> 58:35.637
Thank you so much. What a great meal.

58:35.720 --> 58:36.930
-Thanks so much!
-[Kim] Amazing!

58:38.723 --> 58:40.892
[Phil] The food is incredible.
The views are not bad.

58:40.975 --> 58:43.394
[chuckles]

58:43.478 --> 58:47.482
But you know, I would have been happy
in the basement just to see their faces.

58:50.235 --> 58:53.154
Somebody said, "You seem
to have friends all over the world."

58:53.238 --> 58:55.240
And I'm like, "My God, that's right."

58:56.032 --> 58:57.825
I have friends all over the world now.

59:01.454 --> 59:05.083
Shouldn't we be friends
with people from all over the world?

59:10.046 --> 59:15.051
That alone is a reason to go to visit
the friends that you make in these places.

59:15.802 --> 59:19.097
But you got to start somewhere, so go! Go!

59:19.180 --> 59:21.724
Go now! Stop watching this. Go.
