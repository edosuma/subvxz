KATARA: <i>Water.</i>

00:05.130 --> 00:06.470
<i>Earth.</i>

00:07.010 --> 00:08.470
<i>Fire.</i>

00:09.180 --> 00:10.640
<i>Air.</i>

00:11.550 --> 00:15.600
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

00:15.680 --> 00:19.190
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:22.940
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

00:23.020 --> 00:24.070
<i>could stop them.</i>

00:24.150 --> 00:27.200
<i>But when the world
needed him most, he vanished.</i>

00:27.530 --> 00:28.780
<i>A hundred years passed,</i>

00:28.860 --> 00:31.320
<i>and my brother and I
discovered the new Avatar,</i>

00:31.410 --> 00:33.080
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

00:33.160 --> 00:35.290
<i>And although
his airbending skills are great,</i>

00:35.410 --> 00:38.000
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

00:38.080 --> 00:39.080
AANG: Oof.

00:39.170 --> 00:42.290
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

00:48.220 --> 00:50.720
ROKU: <i>Previously on</i> Avatar...

00:50.840 --> 00:52.050
KATARA: <i>Appa is missing.</i>

00:52.180 --> 00:54.350
<i>We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se.</i>

00:54.720 --> 00:58.140
Professor Zei, head of anthropology
at Ba Sing Se University.

00:58.520 --> 01:02.230
This library is said to contain
a vast collection of knowledge.

01:04.190 --> 01:07.440
SOKKA: Firebenders lose their
bending during a solar eclipse!

01:07.530 --> 01:10.610
We've gotta get this information
to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se.

01:13.620 --> 01:14.830
Hey!

01:14.950 --> 01:17.160
What are you doing firebending your tea?

01:17.580 --> 01:20.040
So the old guy had some hot tea, big deal.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.620
He heated it himself.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.920
Those guys are firebenders.

01:43.060 --> 01:45.110
Look, the inner wall.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.610
I can't believe we finally made it
to Ba Sing Se in one piece.

01:51.700 --> 01:52.780
Hey, don't jinx it!

01:52.860 --> 01:56.490
We could still be attacked by some
giant, exploding Fire Nation spoon.

01:56.580 --> 02:00.040
Or find out the city's been submerged
in an ocean full of killer shrimp.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.250
You been hitting the cactus juice again?

02:02.330 --> 02:03.330
I'm just sayin'.

02:03.420 --> 02:04.920
Weird stuff happens to us.

02:08.210 --> 02:09.710
( SUCKING )

02:11.550 --> 02:13.720
Don't worry, Aang, we'll find Appa.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.390
It's such a big city.

02:15.470 --> 02:16.890
He's a giant bison.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.810
Where could someone possibly hide him?

02:27.070 --> 02:28.070
Oh.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.910
TOPH: Ah, back in the city.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Great.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.290
SOKKA: What's the problem? It's amazing!

02:45.750 --> 02:47.880
Just a bunch of walls and rules.

02:48.420 --> 02:50.880
You wait, you'll get sick of it
in a couple of days.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.470
AANG: I'm comin' for you, buddy.

02:59.890 --> 03:01.470
He's here, I can feel it.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.990
Hello, my name is Joo Dee.

03:13.070 --> 03:17.450
I have been given the great honor
of showing the Avatar around Ba Sing Se.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.370
And you must be Sokka, Katara and Toph.

03:20.910 --> 03:22.700
Welcome to our wonderful city.

03:22.790 --> 03:24.290
Shall we get started?

03:24.580 --> 03:27.290
Yes, we have information
about the Fire Nation army

03:27.380 --> 03:29.920
that we need to deliver
to the Earth King immediately.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.130
Great, let's begin our tour.

03:32.210 --> 03:34.800
And then I'll show you
to your new home, here.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.590
I think you'll like it.

03:37.340 --> 03:38.550
Augh!

03:39.260 --> 03:40.760
Maybe you missed what I said.

03:40.850 --> 03:43.600
We need to talk to the king
about the war, it's important.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.520
You're in Ba Sing Se, now.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.100
Everyone is safe here.

03:51.980 --> 03:53.740
This is the lower ring.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.490
What's that wall for?

03:55.570 --> 03:58.070
Oh, Ba Sing Se has many walls.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.410
There are the ones outside, protecting us,

04:00.530 --> 04:03.620
and the ones inside,
that help maintain order.

04:03.950 --> 04:06.410
This is where our newest arrivals live,

04:06.500 --> 04:10.460
as well as our craftsmen and artisans,
people that work with their hands.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.840
It's so quaint and lively.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.380
You do want to watch your step, though.

04:17.470 --> 04:21.010
Why do they have all these poor people
blocked off in one part of the city?

04:21.350 --> 04:23.770
This is why I never came here before.

04:23.850 --> 04:27.440
I always heard it was so different
from the way the monks taught us to live.

04:36.440 --> 04:42.450
I just want our new place to look nice
in case someone brings home a lady friend.

04:42.830 --> 04:44.160
This city is a prison.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.080
I don't want to make a life here.

04:46.160 --> 04:50.210
IROH: Life happens wherever you are,
whether you make it or not.

04:50.290 --> 04:55.340
Now come on, I found us some new jobs
and we start this afternoon.

04:57.970 --> 05:01.340
Look at them, firebenders living
right under everyone's nose.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.100
SMELLERBEE: Jet, you saw a man
with a hot cup of tea.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.930
It doesn't prove he's a firebender.

05:08.020 --> 05:11.150
And what if he is,
are we supposed to attack them?

05:11.230 --> 05:14.360
I thought we were starting over here,
changing our ways.

05:15.110 --> 05:18.490
We are. When I get the evidence I need,
I'll report them to the police

05:18.570 --> 05:21.030
and let them handle it, okay?

05:23.410 --> 05:26.080
JOO DEE: This is the middle ring
of Ba Sing Se,

05:26.160 --> 05:29.960
Home to the financial district,
shops and restaurants and the University.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.500
Yeah, we met a professor
from Ba Sing Se University.

05:32.580 --> 05:34.670
He took us to
an ancient underground library

05:34.750 --> 05:36.880
where we discovered information
about the war

05:36.960 --> 05:39.220
that is absolutely crucial
for the king to hear!

05:39.300 --> 05:41.300
Isn't history fascinating?

05:41.380 --> 05:45.810
Look, here's one of the oldest buildings
in the middle ring, town hall.

05:47.010 --> 05:48.220
Is that woman deaf?

05:48.310 --> 05:50.480
She only seems to hear
every other word I say.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.270
It's called being handled.

05:52.350 --> 05:53.650
Get used to it.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.990
Well, you certainly look like
official tea servers.

06:05.410 --> 06:06.580
How do you feel?

06:06.660 --> 06:07.870
Ridiculous.

06:07.950 --> 06:11.660
Uh, does this possibly come
in a larger size?

06:12.080 --> 06:14.080
I have extra string in the back.

06:14.170 --> 06:16.210
Have some tea while you wait.

06:20.670 --> 06:22.050
Eow!

06:22.380 --> 06:25.850
This tea is nothing more
than hot leaf juice!

06:25.930 --> 06:28.640
Uncle, that's what all tea is.

06:28.720 --> 06:33.520
How could a member of my own family
say something so horrible?

06:33.900 --> 06:36.770
We'll have to make some
major changes around here.

06:37.190 --> 06:38.190
( GASPING )

06:42.950 --> 06:47.330
JOO DEE: The upper ring is home
to our most important citizens.

06:47.410 --> 06:49.410
Your house is not too far from here.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.210
What's inside that wall?

06:58.340 --> 07:00.840
And who are
the mean-looking guys in robes?

07:00.920 --> 07:03.010
Inside is the royal palace.

07:03.090 --> 07:07.720
Those men are agents of the Dai Li,
the cultural authority of Ba Sing Se.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.220
They are the guardians
of all our traditions.

07:10.850 --> 07:12.020
Can we see the king now?

07:12.350 --> 07:13.560
( LAUGHING ) Oh, no!

07:13.640 --> 07:16.440
One doesn't just pop in on the Earth King.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.940
Here we are, your new home.

07:25.450 --> 07:26.820
More good news.

07:26.910 --> 07:30.620
Your request for an audience
with the Earth King is being processed,

07:30.740 --> 07:33.500
and should be put through
in about a month.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.250
Much more quickly than usual.

07:35.620 --> 07:36.870
A month?

07:37.380 --> 07:40.250
Six to eight weeks, actually.

07:47.260 --> 07:48.430
Isn't it nice?

07:48.840 --> 07:51.100
I think you'll really enjoy it here.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.890
I think we'd enjoy it more
if we weren't staying so long.

07:53.980 --> 07:55.600
Can't we see the king any sooner?

07:55.690 --> 07:59.230
The Earth King is very busy
running the finest city in the world,

07:59.310 --> 08:01.400
but he will see you
as soon as time permits.

08:02.070 --> 08:05.860
If we're gonna be here for a month,
we should spend our time looking for Appa.

08:05.950 --> 08:08.860
I'll be happy to escort you
anywhere you'd like to go.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.700
We don't need a babysitter.

08:11.330 --> 08:13.200
Oh, I won't get in the way.

08:13.290 --> 08:16.290
And to leave you alone
would make me a bad host.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.620
Where shall we start?

08:21.920 --> 08:23.210
( CHIRPING )

08:23.300 --> 08:25.300
( SCREECHING )

08:25.380 --> 08:28.510
I'm sorry, but I haven't heard
anything about a flying bison.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.640
I didn't even know there were any.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.810
If someone wanted to sell a stolen animal
without anyone knowing,

08:33.890 --> 08:34.890
where would they go?

08:34.970 --> 08:36.180
Where's the black market?

08:36.270 --> 08:38.350
Who runs it? Come on, you know.

08:39.190 --> 08:40.230
Uh...

08:43.480 --> 08:46.190
That would be illegal.

08:46.280 --> 08:47.490
You'll have to leave now.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.490
Your lemur is harassing my sparrowkeets.

08:54.370 --> 08:58.410
STUDENT: Hmm, I've never seen
any sandbenders or nomads around here.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.920
You should ask Professor Zei,
he teaches the class on desert cultures.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.540
Right.

09:03.630 --> 09:07.300
And which of your professors could we ask
about the war with the Fire Nation?

09:10.220 --> 09:14.470
I don't know, I'm not a political science
student, I have to get to class.

09:14.560 --> 09:15.850
Unh!

09:19.850 --> 09:23.020
JOO DEE: Well, I'm sorry no one
has seen your bison.

09:23.150 --> 09:24.860
Why don't you go get some rest?

09:24.940 --> 09:26.820
Someone will be over with dinner later.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.330
Hey, come with me.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.790
You're the Avatar.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.840
I heard you were in town.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.250
I'm Pong.

09:46.340 --> 09:47.670
Nice to meet you, Pong.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.970
So, Pong, what's goin' on with this city?

09:50.050 --> 09:52.590
Why is everyone here
so scared to talk about the war?

09:52.680 --> 09:54.430
War, scared?

09:54.510 --> 09:55.680
What do you mean?

09:55.760 --> 09:57.680
I can feel you shaking.

09:57.770 --> 10:00.390
Look, I'm just
a minor government official.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.900
I've waited three years to get this house.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.110
I don't want to get into trouble.

10:05.610 --> 10:07.230
Get in trouble with who?

10:07.320 --> 10:10.490
Shh, listen, you can't
mention the war, here.

10:10.570 --> 10:13.950
And whatever you do,
stay away from the Dai Li.

10:20.660 --> 10:22.790
IROH: Would you like a pot of tea?

10:22.870 --> 10:25.840
ZUKO: We've been working
in a tea shop all day.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.550
I'm sick of tea.

10:27.630 --> 10:29.590
Sick of tea?

10:29.670 --> 10:32.300
That's like being sick of breathing.

10:33.720 --> 10:37.010
Have you seen our spark rocks
to heat up the water?

10:37.100 --> 10:39.520
They're not there.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.020
You'll have to firebend, old man.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.690
JET: Where are you going?

10:46.230 --> 10:49.280
IROH: I borrowed our neighbor's.

10:49.360 --> 10:50.820
Such kind people.

10:55.910 --> 10:57.780
( CHIRPING )

11:00.240 --> 11:02.620
( YAWNING )

11:04.670 --> 11:05.670
( GASPING )

11:05.960 --> 11:06.960
I've got it!

11:07.040 --> 11:09.040
I know how we're gonna see the Earth King.

11:09.380 --> 11:10.840
How're we supposed to do that?

11:10.920 --> 11:13.670
"One doesn't just pop in
on the Earth King."

11:13.920 --> 11:17.220
The king is having a party
at the palace tonight for his pet bear.

11:17.300 --> 11:19.100
You mean platypus-bear?

11:19.180 --> 11:21.140
No, it just says "bear."

11:21.640 --> 11:23.770
Certainly you mean his pet skunk-bear.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.230
Or his armadillo-bear.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.560
Gopher-bear?

11:26.650 --> 11:28.480
Just "bear."

11:29.400 --> 11:31.570
This place is weird.

11:31.730 --> 11:33.280
The palace will be packed.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.200
We can sneak in with a crowd.

11:35.280 --> 11:36.990
- Won't work.
- Why not?

11:37.070 --> 11:39.200
Well, no offense
to you simple country folk,

11:39.280 --> 11:42.580
but a real society crowd
would spot you a mile away.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.000
You've got no manners.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.210
Excuse me?

11:46.290 --> 11:47.750
I've got no manners?

11:47.830 --> 11:50.500
You're not exactly Lady Fancy Fingers.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.090
( TOPH BURPS )

11:52.170 --> 11:55.630
I learned proper society
behavior and chose to leave it.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.430
You never learned anything.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.140
And frankly, it's a little too late.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.850
Ah-ha, but you learned it!

12:01.930 --> 12:03.180
You could teach us.

12:03.270 --> 12:05.020
Yeah, I'm mastering every element.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.350
How hard can manners be?

"Lord Momo of the Momo dynasty,
your Momo-ness."

12:25.120 --> 12:27.120
Katara might be able to pull it off,

but you two would be lucky
to pass as busboys.

12:46.350 --> 12:48.690
Wow, you look beautiful.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.940
Don't talk to the commoners, Katara.

12:52.020 --> 12:53.690
First rule of society.

12:54.110 --> 12:57.860
We'll get in the party and then find
a way to let you in through the side gate.

13:00.990 --> 13:02.490
( GONG RINGING )

13:12.790 --> 13:14.590
SMELLERBEE: Jet, we need to talk.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.710
What? Oh, great, it's you guys.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.930
Where have you been? I could use
some help with surveillance here.

13:20.010 --> 13:23.800
We've been talking, and we think
you're becoming obsessed with this.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.100
It's not healthy.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.310
Oh, really?

13:26.390 --> 13:27.520
You both think this?

13:28.730 --> 13:31.060
We came here to make a fresh start.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.770
But you won't let this go.

13:32.860 --> 13:34.480
Even though there's no real proof!

13:34.570 --> 13:36.230
Well, maybe if you'd help me.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.150
Jet, you've gotta stop this.

13:38.570 --> 13:40.860
Maybe you've forgotten why we
need to start over.

13:40.950 --> 13:44.280
Maybe you've forgotten about how
the Fire Nation left us all homeless?

13:44.370 --> 13:46.540
How they wiped out
all the people we loved?

13:46.620 --> 13:49.460
If you don't wanna help me,
I'll get the evidence on my own.

13:57.380 --> 13:59.510
This is the best tea in the city.

13:59.970 --> 14:03.010
The secret ingredient is love.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.060
I think you're due for a raise.

14:12.940 --> 14:14.190
I'm tired of waiting.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.690
These two men are firebenders!

14:26.660 --> 14:28.200
I know they're firebenders!

14:28.290 --> 14:30.370
I saw the old man heating his tea.

14:30.950 --> 14:32.460
He works in a tea shop.

14:32.660 --> 14:34.750
He's a firebender, I'm telling you!

14:35.170 --> 14:37.800
Drop your swords, boy, nice and easy.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.380
You'll have to defend yourself.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.220
Then everyone will know.

14:41.510 --> 14:43.680
Go ahead, show them what you can do.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.390
You want a show?

14:46.470 --> 14:47.470
I'll give you a show.

15:08.740 --> 15:09.990
MAN: Invitation, please.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.540
I think this will do.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.000
No entry without an invitation.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.620
Step out of line, please.

15:16.170 --> 15:19.960
Look, the Pangs and the Yumsoon-Hans
are waiting in there for us.

15:20.050 --> 15:22.760
I'm gonna have to
tell them who didn't let me in.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.430
Step out of line, please.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.390
KATARA: Sir?

15:35.480 --> 15:38.940
I'm sorry to bother you, but my
cousin lost our invitations.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.940
( WHISPERING ) She's blind.

15:41.360 --> 15:42.860
Do you think you could help us?

15:42.940 --> 15:45.780
Our family's inside,
and I'm sure they're very worried.

15:46.530 --> 15:47.570
I am honored.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.120
Please come with me.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.040
Nyaa. ( BLOWING RASPBERRY )

16:01.420 --> 16:03.090
He's taking all the good stuff.

16:03.460 --> 16:07.260
Quiet, you don't know what I had to do
to get seats this near the bear.

16:13.560 --> 16:14.810
It's beautiful, isn't it?

16:15.310 --> 16:17.480
By the way, I'm Long Feng.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.400
I'm a cultural minister to the king.

16:19.860 --> 16:23.320
I'm Hwamei, and this is Dung.

16:23.900 --> 16:24.900
Ow!

16:25.240 --> 16:26.530
Now where is your family?

16:26.610 --> 16:28.070
I'd love to meet them.

16:28.360 --> 16:31.740
Uh, I don't see 'em right now,
but I'm sure we'll find them soon.

16:31.830 --> 16:33.290
Thanks for all your help.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.750
Don't worry, as your escort,

16:38.830 --> 16:43.050
it would be dishonorable to abandon you
ladies without finding your family, first.

16:43.130 --> 16:44.510
We'll keep looking.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.760
Where are they?

16:48.840 --> 16:51.090
Look, I came up with a back-up plan.

16:51.180 --> 16:53.760
We dress Momo like a ghost, okay?

16:53.850 --> 16:56.560
He flies by the guards,
creating a distraction.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.140
Then we blast a hole in the wall...

16:59.230 --> 17:01.480
Or we can go in with these guys.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.570
AANG: Toph said we might pass as busboys.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.570
Okay, but remember that Momo ghost plan.

17:06.650 --> 17:07.950
I think it's a winner.

17:09.990 --> 17:11.530
Ugh!

17:11.620 --> 17:12.740
( GRUNTING )

17:13.200 --> 17:15.450
You must be getting tired
of using those swords.

17:15.540 --> 17:18.160
Why don't you go ahead and firebend at me?

17:18.250 --> 17:20.170
Please, son, you're confused!

17:20.250 --> 17:22.130
You don't know what you're doing!

17:22.920 --> 17:26.300
JET: Bet you wish he helped you out
with a little fire blast right now.

17:27.590 --> 17:29.470
You're the one who needs help.

17:39.060 --> 17:41.600
You see that?
The Fire Nation is trying to silence me!

17:41.980 --> 17:43.480
It'll never happen.

17:44.060 --> 17:45.070
( GRUNTING )

17:49.820 --> 17:51.280
Where are Toph and Katara?

17:51.360 --> 17:54.030
Forget about them, just keep
an eye out for the king.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.490
I don't know what he looks like.

17:56.580 --> 18:00.660
You know, royal,
flowing robe, fancy jewelry.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.670
AANG: That could be anyone.

18:04.210 --> 18:06.040
Another crab puff, please.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.170
You found us!

18:08.260 --> 18:11.170
I'd know your little footsteps
anywhere, twinkle toes.

18:11.260 --> 18:12.880
Thanks for letting us in.

18:12.970 --> 18:16.310
Sorry, but the guy who escorted us in
won't let us out of his sight.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.890
What guy?

18:19.350 --> 18:20.890
What are you doing here?

18:21.180 --> 18:24.810
You have to leave immediately,
or we'll all be in terrible trouble.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.820
Not until we see the king.

18:27.270 --> 18:29.190
You don't understand. You must go.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.780
( WOMAN SCREAMING )

18:32.860 --> 18:33.950
Oh!

18:34.030 --> 18:35.660
AANG: Sorry, no, don't shout.

18:41.160 --> 18:42.290
The Avatar.

18:42.620 --> 18:45.210
Oh, I didn't know
the Avatar would be here.

18:53.220 --> 18:54.430
( LAUGHING WEAKLY )

18:54.510 --> 18:56.930
You keep their attention
while I look for the king.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.430
Watch this, everybody.

19:07.860 --> 19:09.360
CROWD: Ooh...

19:09.440 --> 19:10.570
( APPLAUSE )

19:11.030 --> 19:12.110
( LAUGHING, GROWLING )

19:12.650 --> 19:13.650
( GRUNTING )

19:22.700 --> 19:24.330
Drop your weapons.

19:24.410 --> 19:26.120
Arrest them, they're firebenders.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.170
This poor boy is confused.

19:29.590 --> 19:32.010
We're just simple refugees.

19:32.380 --> 19:36.930
This young man wrecked my tea shop
and assaulted my employees!

19:37.010 --> 19:39.180
It's true, sir. We saw the whole thing.

19:39.260 --> 19:42.060
This crazy kid attacked
the finest tea maker in the city.

19:42.430 --> 19:44.940
Oh, that's very sweet.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.230
Come with us, son.

19:49.270 --> 19:50.400
( GRUNTING )

19:52.730 --> 19:53.780
You don't understand!

19:53.860 --> 19:55.070
They're Fire Nation!

19:55.150 --> 19:56.610
You have to believe me.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.940
Aang, the Earth King.

20:32.320 --> 20:33.780
Greetings, your majesty.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.900
( GASPING )

20:41.990 --> 20:44.120
Augh, ugh, let me go!

20:47.370 --> 20:48.580

( CHIRPING )

20:57.050 --> 20:59.630
Avatar, it is a great honor to meet you.

20:59.720 --> 21:04.390
I am Long Feng, grand secretary
of Ba Sing Se and head of the Dai Li.

21:04.470 --> 21:05.720
I'd like to talk to you.

21:05.810 --> 21:08.230
Your friends will be
waiting for us in the library.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.730
SOKKA: Why won't you let us
talk to the king?

21:14.820 --> 21:17.740
We have information that could
defeat the Fire Nation!

21:17.820 --> 21:21.490
LONG FENG: The Earth King has no time
to get involved with political squabbles

21:21.570 --> 21:23.910
and the day-to-day minutia
of military activities.

21:23.990 --> 21:27.330
AANG: This could be the most
important thing he's ever heard.

21:27.410 --> 21:29.790
What's most important to his royal majesty

21:29.870 --> 21:33.250
is maintaining
the cultural heritage of Ba Sing Se.

21:33.340 --> 21:36.420
All his duties relate to
issuing decrees on such matters.

21:36.510 --> 21:41.640
It's my job to oversee the rest of the
city's resources, including the military.

21:41.970 --> 21:44.010
So the king is just a figurehead.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.510
He's your puppet.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.470
Oh, no, no.

21:47.560 --> 21:50.980
His majesty is an icon,
a god to his people.

21:51.060 --> 21:54.860
He can't sully his hands
with the hourly changes of an endless war.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.780
But we found out about a solar eclipse

21:56.860 --> 21:58.940
that will leave
the Fire Nation defenseless.

21:59.030 --> 22:00.530
You could lead an invasion...

22:00.610 --> 22:02.990
Enough, I don't want to hear
your ridiculous plan.

22:03.070 --> 22:07.990
It is the strict policy of Ba Sing Se that
the war not be mentioned within the walls.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.160
Constant news of an escalating war

22:10.290 --> 22:13.250
<i>will throw the citizens of Ba Sing Se
into a state of panic.</i>

22:14.250 --> 22:16.340
You have to believe me,
they're firebenders.

22:16.420 --> 22:18.630
They won't stop until they win the war.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.260
Calm down, you're safe now.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.350
Our economy would be ruined,

22:27.470 --> 22:30.230
our peaceful way of life,
our traditions would disappear.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.150
There's no war in Ba Sing Se.

22:34.810 --> 22:36.110
What are you talking about?

22:36.190 --> 22:39.280
Where do you think all the refugees
come from? You can't hide it.

22:40.490 --> 22:45.120
In silencing talk of conflict, Ba Sing Se
remains a peaceful, orderly utopia.

22:45.660 --> 22:47.450
The last one on Earth.

22:48.870 --> 22:50.330
( MUFFLED GRUNTING )

22:51.000 --> 22:53.080
There is no war within the walls.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.460
Here we are safe.

22:55.210 --> 22:57.750
Here we are free.

22:59.750 --> 23:02.130
You can't keep the truth
from all these people.

23:02.220 --> 23:03.340
They have to know.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.800
I'll tell them.

23:04.890 --> 23:06.760
I'll make sure everyone knows.

23:06.850 --> 23:09.310
Until now, you've been treated
as our honored guest.

23:09.720 --> 23:13.560
But from now on, you will be
watched every moment by Dai Li agents.

23:13.690 --> 23:17.360
If you mention the war to anyone,
you will be expelled from the city.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.110
I understand you've been
looking for your bison.

23:20.190 --> 23:23.860
It would be quite a shame if you were
not able to complete your quest.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.870
Now Joo Dee will show you home.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.000
WOMAN: Come with me, please.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.370
What happened to Joo Dee?

23:33.830 --> 23:35.000
I'm Joo Dee.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.540
I'll be your host as long
as you're in our wonderful city.
