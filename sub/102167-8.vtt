WEBVTT

00:29.154 --> 00:32.658
There's been no sign of a Russian
countermove on the lunar surface, sir.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.285
We have two-man teams
guarding the site around the clock.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.455
Soviet activity around Zvezda
is proceeding normally.

00:39.164 --> 00:42.334
There's also been no increase
in military activity in Earth's orbit.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.962
Then I'd say our little operation
was a success.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.297
Yes, sir. It sure looks that way.

00:47.381 --> 00:51.134
Please relay my personal thanks
to everyone at NASA on a job well done.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.053
Thank you, sir. I will.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.930
Mr. President, if I may?

00:55.013 --> 00:58.267
There's still the matter
of the Apollo-Soyuz mission.

00:58.350 --> 01:02.229
What do you think, Ellen?
Should we proceed or cancel the mission?

01:02.312 --> 01:05.983
We still have the moral high ground
after the shoot down of KAL 7.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.317
I think we should keep it.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.445
We've extended our hand in friendship
for all the world to see.

01:10.529 --> 01:13.365
If Andropov wants to slap it away,
let him.

01:13.448 --> 01:16.910
Let everyone see who's working for war
and who's working for peace.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.997
My feeling exactly.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.498
-Proceed as planned.
-Yes, sir.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.084
And I appreciate the way
you handled this situation

01:24.168 --> 01:26.587
under extremely difficult circumstances.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.839
Thank you, sir. That's very kind.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.383
I'd like to officially nominate you
to the Senate

01:31.466 --> 01:33.969
as the new permanent administrator
of NASA.

01:37.973 --> 01:40.517
Well, sir, that's quite an honor.

01:42.144 --> 01:43.645
I'm not sure what to say.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.522
Your country needs you, Ellen.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.233
But take your time and think it over.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.402
Thank you, everyone.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.614
So...

01:55.115 --> 01:56.491
Wow.

01:58.327 --> 01:59.369
Congratulations.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.080
Old man knows how to pick 'em.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.582
Thanks, I think.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.211
What, are you holding out
for a bigger office than Margo?

02:09.378 --> 02:12.299
I would just like to think it over,
that's all.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.800
Think what over, Ellen?

02:14.760 --> 02:16.345
This is our ticket to Mars.

02:16.428 --> 02:19.932
With you in the cabinet,
it'll become a priority again.

02:20.015 --> 02:23.894
It was a priority for Tom.
Didn't seem to make much difference.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.355
You're an astronaut.
That gives you a different voice.

02:26.939 --> 02:30.108
She's right.
President loves his astronauts.

02:30.192 --> 02:33.320
And you're not just any astronaut.
You're the girl who caught the tank.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.991
He'll listen to you on space policy
more than anyone else.

02:39.368 --> 02:40.410
Maybe.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.037
I'll think about it.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.334
General?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.467
Thank you.

02:57.761 --> 03:01.557
So, the Soviets have delayed
the launch of their Buran shuttle.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.641
Probably for repairs.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.519
Wheeled it back into the maintenance
building this morning.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.814
I told you so.
They got smart people over there too.

03:08.897 --> 03:12.109
Probably figured out your little
O-ring problem all by themselves.

03:12.818 --> 03:13.944
Probably so.

03:22.119 --> 03:25.205
Emma, reach out to Sergei Nikulov.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.666
He and his team need to get back here
as soon as possible

03:27.749 --> 03:30.836
to finalize preparations.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.588
Yes, ma'am. Just a reminder,

03:32.671 --> 03:35.924
Columbia is on the pad,
scheduled for a 1430 liftoff.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.343
-Columbia?
-Gordo's flight.

03:38.427 --> 03:39.970
Must be beside himself.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.889
Let's just hope he's sober.

04:05.996 --> 04:09.333
MS-2. Right wrist ring.
Soft capture and lock.

04:10.292 --> 04:13.170
Copy. MS-2. Right wrist ring complete.

04:13.795 --> 04:14.880
How's that feel?

04:14.963 --> 04:16.048
Fits good.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.348
PLT left wrist ring.
Soft capture and lock.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.851
Copy. PLT left wrist ring...

04:46.662 --> 04:48.830
-I'll take it from here.
-Yes, sir.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.166
Here you go, sir.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.337
Jesus, Ed.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.881
Don't you got anything better to do

04:57.965 --> 05:00.801
than to come all the way down to Florida
just to screw up my launch?

05:00.884 --> 05:02.803
I want to take one last look
at these old shuttles

05:02.886 --> 05:05.472
before my Pathfinder
make 'em all obsolete.

05:05.556 --> 05:06.640
Fat chance.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.104
Pathfinder's like a Chihuahua
compared to my sweet ride.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.650
Yeah, you just listen
to the big kids up front,

05:16.733 --> 05:19.653
don't touch anything, you'll be just fine.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.578
I'm proud of you, man.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.079
Thanks.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.374
Couldn't have done it without you.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.085
You ready?

06:09.036 --> 06:10.204
Godspeed.

06:22.466 --> 06:25.344
Coming up on the 30-second mark,

06:25.427 --> 06:27.429
and we are go for auto-sequence start.

06:30.349 --> 06:33.477
SRB hydraulic power units have started.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.950
T minus 20 seconds...

06:48.617 --> 06:51.620
18, 17,

06:51.703 --> 06:55.541
16, 15, 14,

06:56.250 --> 06:59.711
13, 12, ten...

06:59.795 --> 07:01.713
We have go for main engine start.

07:11.807 --> 07:15.185
Liftoff of Columbia and astronaut
Gordon Stevens to space

07:15.269 --> 07:17.062
after a ten-year absence.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.285
I'm back, baby.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.829
I'm back.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.166
You can sit back now.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.755
You have what we call
normal-tension glaucoma.

09:06.839 --> 09:10.384
It's a rare condition.
No one knows exactly what causes it.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.637
It means that your eye pressure's
within the normal range,

09:13.720 --> 09:15.889
but your optic nerve has been damaged.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.892
It could be a problem
with the amount of blood

09:18.976 --> 09:20.894
that's being supplied to the optic nerve,

09:20.978 --> 09:23.021
or you could have a sensitive optic nerve.

09:23.647 --> 09:27.150
Or there could be other conditions
that have impaired circulation.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.402
Like radiation?

09:29.820 --> 09:33.657
Possibly. I don't know of any studies
looking at that as a cause.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.703
Were you exposed to
an unusual amount of radiation

09:37.786 --> 09:38.996
on your last trip to the moon?

09:39.079 --> 09:40.622
Not as far as you know.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.583
I see.

09:42.666 --> 09:46.211
And I assume you have not had an exam
by the flight surgeon at NASA.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.214
Could you just
tell me about the treatment?

09:49.298 --> 09:51.967
Well, the treatment to slow down
the loss of vision

09:52.050 --> 09:54.094
would probably entail
prescription eyedrops,

09:54.178 --> 09:57.097
combined with oral medication
and possibly surgery.

09:57.181 --> 09:59.016
-Surgery?
-Possibly.

09:59.099 --> 10:03.604
But again, we're talking about slowing
down the deterioration of your vision,

10:03.687 --> 10:06.064
not stopping it
and certainly not reversing it.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.986
I'm sorry. So, you're saying
that you wanna cut open my eyeballs,

10:11.069 --> 10:12.779
but that's not gonna fix it.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.782
I don't wanna cut open anything.
It's just a possibility.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.910
But no, it's not going to fix this.

10:18.994 --> 10:22.497
I'm very sorry, Ms. Cobb.
Glaucoma is not curable.

10:23.415 --> 10:25.042
You could ask for a second opinion,

10:25.125 --> 10:27.544
but I'm quite certain
that you're going to experience

10:27.628 --> 10:30.005
a progressive loss of vision from now on.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.674
And ultimately permanent blindness.

10:45.187 --> 10:46.230
Thank you, Doc.

10:48.232 --> 10:51.360
The flight surgeons are pretty good.
They're not going to miss this.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.095
Ellington Ops. NASA niner-6-4.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.639
Copy, Molly. Hold one.

11:20.722 --> 11:24.017
Request you open box Whiskey 147 Charlie.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.187
NASA niner-6-4, Ellington Ops.

11:27.271 --> 11:30.607
You got it, Molly.
Box Whiskey 147 Charlie is open.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.153
Come on, let's see what you got.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.494
Give me more. More!

11:43.370 --> 11:44.830
Come on.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.000
Go.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.295
Goddamn it. Go.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.300
Fuck you!

11:57.467 --> 12:00.512
Come on! Go.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.596
NASA niner-6-4. Ellington Ops.

12:42.679 --> 12:46.558
You okay there, Molly?
Your altitude just dropped 15,000 feet.

12:48.060 --> 12:50.395
Roger that, Ellington Ops. I'm good.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.315
Everything's A-okay.

12:58.904 --> 13:01.365
The president
has decided to arm Pathfinder

13:02.282 --> 13:06.036
to show the Soviets this is not
some tit-for-tat little game.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.580
This puts us in the driver's seat.

13:09.373 --> 13:11.959
Now, we are going to install a battery
of four Phoenix missiles

13:12.042 --> 13:13.502
in Pathfinder's cargo bay.

13:14.169 --> 13:16.421
Now, the space variant of the AIM-54C

13:16.505 --> 13:19.007
has been in development
for several years at Vandenberg.

13:19.091 --> 13:24.263
It was designed to be in a DOD shuttle,
but it will be compatible with Pathfinder.

13:24.346 --> 13:27.933
It's been decided that
this will henceforth be a joint mission

13:28.016 --> 13:30.894
between NASA
and the Department of Defense.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.647
Management of flight operations
will be controlled from MOCR,

13:33.730 --> 13:37.568
but operations concerning
the Phoenix missiles will come from DOD.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.778
Will we be firing missiles
on this mission?

13:39.862 --> 13:42.948
There will be a live fire exercise
to demonstrate the system.

13:43.824 --> 13:47.160
Now, your targets will be a series
of drones launched into low Earth orbit

13:47.244 --> 13:49.872
with a radar signature
simulating a Russian satellite.

13:49.955 --> 13:51.999
How many missiles will we fire
during the exercise?

13:52.082 --> 13:56.753
-So we're a warship now?
-No. Pathfinder is not a warship.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.339
But we're packed with missiles
and shooting things out of the sky.

13:59.423 --> 14:03.218
Pathfinder's weapon system
is intended primarily for self-defense.

14:03.302 --> 14:05.679
Primarily, but not exclusively.

14:06.555 --> 14:09.850
So in theory, these same missiles
could be used for offensive purposes.

14:09.933 --> 14:10.934
Am I right?

14:11.602 --> 14:13.896
That's not in the mission plan.

14:13.979 --> 14:17.065
This flight is a test
of the entire Pathfinder system,

14:17.149 --> 14:20.194
and as such, it is appropriate
that we test this newest...

14:21.737 --> 14:22.738
component.

14:22.821 --> 14:24.740
But it is only a test.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.749
Phoenix is radar-guided.

14:33.832 --> 14:36.418
With an operational range
of 100 nautical miles,

14:36.502 --> 14:39.421
it uses a proximity fuse
detonation system.

14:39.505 --> 14:41.507
And once inside the cargo bay,

14:41.590 --> 14:46.053
the lift variation will be exactly
128 pounds per square inch.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.352
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.316
What is it?

15:05.280 --> 15:08.575
The president offered to make me
NASA administrator.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.163
-Aren't you already doing that?
-Permanently.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.585
Wow.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.380
That's amazing, Ellen.

15:21.463 --> 15:23.715
Congratulations. That's really--

15:23.799 --> 15:25.133
Crazy, I know.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.220
It's not like I'm gonna actually take it.

15:40.274 --> 15:41.316
Are you sure?

15:42.401 --> 15:45.487
Of course. Yeah, I'm just waiting
for the right time to tell him.

15:45.571 --> 15:47.823
There's so much going on right now.

15:48.866 --> 15:51.660
Yeah, but... this is huge.

15:53.412 --> 15:57.207
I mean, you could...
be a part of Reagan's cabinet.

15:58.208 --> 16:01.545
-You sound like you want me to take it.
-No, it's just...

16:03.463 --> 16:05.299
Isn't this everything you always wanted?

16:09.595 --> 16:12.681
You would be in charge of NASA.
You could finally get to Mars--

16:12.764 --> 16:13.849
Hey.

16:15.434 --> 16:17.186
You're what I want.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.648
Yeah?

16:23.317 --> 16:24.318
Yeah.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.160
Gosh, this place must seem huge
compared to the last time you were here.

18:38.869 --> 18:42.039
Yeah, didn't have a lot of legroom
to walk around, that's for sure.

18:42.915 --> 18:44.833
I know. It's crazy.

18:46.210 --> 18:50.297
I mean, just to think about
what you guys did in here.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.591
I mean, it's the galley now.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.469
Yeah. Yeah, I knew that.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.222
That's where your old bunk
used to be, right?

18:59.097 --> 19:00.349
Looks about right.

19:01.266 --> 19:02.809
So, where am I bunking now?

19:02.893 --> 19:05.187
I don't know how you guys did it, man.

19:05.270 --> 19:09.733
All that time in this one room, I mean,
I would probably just go out of my gourd.

19:09.816 --> 19:10.901
Nick.

19:11.568 --> 19:12.945
New bunk.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.114
Right, sorry.

19:16.865 --> 19:21.286
Got you a prime spot right here
in crew quarters A.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.747
Far away from the recirculating pump.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.791
That sucker starts up
about every half hour.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.502
Drives most people crazy
until they tune it out.

19:28.585 --> 19:31.755
Well, I sleep like the dead,
so no worries there.

19:31.839 --> 19:36.760
Well, you are very lucky, because Vance
over there snores like a roller coaster.

19:36.844 --> 19:40.556
Man, I mean,
up, down, up, down, all night.

19:40.639 --> 19:43.809
He's a good guy.
Though he's one of the marines.

19:43.892 --> 19:47.312
Little bit edgy. But he's right over here.

19:47.396 --> 19:49.565
And across from him is

19:50.274 --> 19:53.402
where your ex is hot racking.

19:54.152 --> 19:57.823
Sorry. Crew quarters B and C are full.
There's not that much space up here.

19:57.906 --> 20:01.034
-Hope you don't mind.
-Nah. No, we're good.

20:01.952 --> 20:02.953
Where is she anyway?

20:04.454 --> 20:05.747
She's out with the marines.

20:05.831 --> 20:08.667
They've been doing EVAs
by the reactor all week.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.919
Something with
the last Sea Dragon's cargo.

20:11.003 --> 20:13.380
All very hush-hush.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.799
Very top secret stuff.

20:15.883 --> 20:17.593
With the marines? Tracy?

20:17.676 --> 20:19.094
It was supposed to be temporary,

20:19.178 --> 20:21.680
until one of their guys
could get up to speed on flying the LSAM.

20:21.763 --> 20:24.349
But word is guy's
not getting the hang of it.

20:24.433 --> 20:27.144
Yeah, well, LSAM's a tricky beast.

20:28.020 --> 20:31.607
Holy shit, that's right.
You flew the original.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.610
Afraid that one's just a junker now.

20:34.693 --> 20:36.195
We just use it for spare parts.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.447
But the other two are still flyable.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.657
Although they're getting pretty cranky
in their old age.

20:40.741 --> 20:43.243
Aren't we all? Well, I wouldn't worry.

20:43.327 --> 20:46.330
I'm sure Trace will get that poor jarhead
up to speed in no time.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.041
Yeah. Yeah, maybe. Probably.

20:49.124 --> 20:51.919
Anyways, I'll just let you get settled in.

20:52.002 --> 20:53.086
All right.

20:53.170 --> 20:55.506
Welcome home, sir.

21:07.893 --> 21:09.186
Look, these three teams

21:09.269 --> 21:11.396
are working on separate components
of the docking module

21:11.480 --> 21:13.232
that will eventually
have to work together.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.150
Mechanisms, avionics, life support.

21:15.234 --> 21:17.861
But the inter-team review doesn't happen

21:17.945 --> 21:21.281
until after each team has completed
their preliminary design.

21:21.365 --> 21:24.243
Standard procedure.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.370
Yes, I know, you've told me.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.413
But if they simply collaborated
from the outset--

21:28.497 --> 21:29.748
No.

21:30.374 --> 21:32.835
I'm an engineer,
and I'm looking at a bad design.

21:32.918 --> 21:34.628
That's rich.

21:35.796 --> 21:39.383
For your information,
we went to the moon with this bad design

21:39.466 --> 21:42.094
while you were literally in diapers.

21:43.262 --> 21:45.514
Maybe you should have worn diapers
during Gemini.

21:48.225 --> 21:50.686
-Get out!
-Sure thing.

21:51.478 --> 21:52.604
Peanut.

22:42.905 --> 22:44.531
I'm sorry, I don't...

22:45.115 --> 22:46.116
Sorry.

22:46.950 --> 22:49.411
Welcome to Little Saigon.
How many in your party?

22:49.494 --> 22:50.787
Just me.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.628
-Something to drink?
-Coke.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.655
Know what you want?

23:26.031 --> 23:27.282
Not really.

23:27.366 --> 23:29.701
I haven't had that much Vietnamese food,
to be honest.

23:29.785 --> 23:31.119
Adopted?

23:31.203 --> 23:32.329
Yeah.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.331
-Do you like Chinese food?
-I love it.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.708
It's similar, sorta.

23:37.251 --> 23:40.879
I'd start off with some spring rolls.
Then either pho or banh mi.

23:42.881 --> 23:45.342
Beef noodle soup or a pork sandwich.

23:45.425 --> 23:48.804
The sandwich is good,
but pho is Dad's specialty.

23:49.888 --> 23:52.432
-Your dad's the cook?
-Yeah.

23:55.102 --> 23:56.645
I'll try the "fo."

23:56.728 --> 23:58.605
-Pho.
-Pho.

24:38.395 --> 24:41.148
Told you. Family recipe.

24:41.231 --> 24:42.524
It was delicious.

24:44.318 --> 24:45.319
Could you sit?

24:49.740 --> 24:52.409
So, did your dad learn to cook in Vietnam?

24:52.492 --> 24:54.828
From his mother, my grandmother.

24:54.912 --> 24:56.955
-Is she still alive?
-Who knows?

24:57.039 --> 24:59.708
Dad pretty much cut off all ties
when he left.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.960
Doesn't talk about family back there much.

25:03.837 --> 25:05.005
What about your mom?

25:05.589 --> 25:08.467
She's here. Not today, but she's alive.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.470
She's not from Vietnam though.
They met after he came to the States.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.056
So you were born here?

25:14.139 --> 25:17.434
Yeah, I'm a natural-born
all-American girl.

25:19.228 --> 25:20.979
Here. Whenever you're ready.

26:29.006 --> 26:30.632
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

26:32.509 --> 26:34.595
-Here's your change.
-You can keep it.

26:34.678 --> 26:37.472
Thanks.
Try the broken rice with pork next time.

26:37.556 --> 26:38.932
I'm assuming you're coming back

26:39.016 --> 26:41.101
and spending a lot more money
with your friends?

26:41.185 --> 26:44.730
Yeah, I'll definitely
be thinking about it. Thanks.

27:10.339 --> 27:11.632
I have target acquisition.

27:13.217 --> 27:15.886
Confirmed. Radar shows two active targets.

27:15.969 --> 27:18.222
First target range 31 kilometers.

27:18.305 --> 27:21.642
Relative velocity out of plane
1.2 meters per second.

27:21.725 --> 27:23.477
Within targeting parameters.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.771
Ride, lock weapons system to target one.

27:25.854 --> 27:28.065
System locked. Target one.

27:28.732 --> 27:31.568
Lock confirmed.
Second target range 45 kilometers.

27:31.652 --> 27:34.571
Y and Z velocities
are within targeting thresholds.

27:34.655 --> 27:36.114
Target will be out of range soon.

27:36.198 --> 27:37.491
Switching to second target.

27:38.659 --> 27:40.953
System locked. Target two.

27:42.579 --> 27:44.498
Lock confirmed. Ready to fire.

27:45.541 --> 27:46.625
Fire.

27:48.585 --> 27:49.628
Fox three.

27:50.420 --> 27:51.964
Good lock on first target.

27:52.047 --> 27:54.007
-Fire.
-Fox three.

27:54.091 --> 27:57.344
Good target lock on both. Target's
maneuvering, weapons still on track.

27:59.137 --> 28:01.849
First target destroyed.
Second missile approaching.

28:02.432 --> 28:03.684
Second target destroyed.

28:06.854 --> 28:08.564
Confirmed. No active targets.

28:10.399 --> 28:11.441
They're all dead.

28:11.525 --> 28:12.776
Sim complete.

28:12.860 --> 28:15.195
Secure cabin and prepare for debrief.

28:19.074 --> 28:20.659
-Nice work, people.
-Thanks, chief.

28:21.785 --> 28:23.036
Yeah, thanks.

28:24.371 --> 28:25.998
Look, I could use some air.

28:54.568 --> 28:55.777
Not so bad.

28:57.654 --> 28:59.406
Not bad at all.

29:07.122 --> 29:08.999
-Boo!
-Jesus!

29:10.083 --> 29:11.084
Fuck.

29:11.168 --> 29:12.169
You hurt yourself?

29:13.045 --> 29:14.087
No.

29:15.255 --> 29:17.257
-No.
-You should have seen your face.

29:17.341 --> 29:19.259
Yeah, got me good, I guess.

29:22.638 --> 29:23.764
So you're here.

29:23.847 --> 29:24.848
Here I am.

29:24.932 --> 29:26.558
How's it feel? Feel any different?

29:27.142 --> 29:28.602
-Totally different.
-Yeah?

29:28.685 --> 29:30.521
Like, different in every--

29:30.604 --> 29:33.982
Hey, Vance.
Have you met my ex-husband Gordo?

29:34.066 --> 29:35.526
Gordo, this is Vance Paulson.

29:35.609 --> 29:39.279
He's one of the leathernecks sent here to
protect us from the red menace out there.

29:39.363 --> 29:41.198
Hey. Pleasure.

29:41.281 --> 29:42.407
Likewise.

29:42.491 --> 29:43.992
-Navy, right?
-That's right.

29:44.076 --> 29:46.078
I won't hold it against you.

29:46.954 --> 29:48.872
This one here,
she should have been a marine.

29:48.956 --> 29:49.957
Oh, stop.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.626
No, the way that she flew that bucket
when we swooped in on the Russians?

29:52.709 --> 29:54.336
We came right down to the deck.

29:54.419 --> 29:57.214
So low if there were rabbits out there
we'd have been clipping their ears.

29:57.297 --> 29:58.298
Thing of beauty.

29:58.382 --> 30:01.426
Y'all are such pussies.
I was at least five meters off the deck.

30:01.510 --> 30:04.179
Five-- My ass.

30:04.263 --> 30:06.557
I got moondust in my boots
from kicking the hilltops.

30:06.640 --> 30:07.933
Your boots?

30:08.016 --> 30:10.811
Yeah, they were
hanging on the outside skids,

30:10.894 --> 30:12.521
all Tarzan-like.

30:12.604 --> 30:15.566
Yeah, singing "Ride of the Valkyries"
Apocalypse Now-style.

30:15.649 --> 30:17.693
-That was some fun shit.
-Fun shit.

30:17.776 --> 30:20.112
These bastards keep me young.

30:20.696 --> 30:23.740
Well, I'm hungrier than a horse.
I'm gonna go grab some chow.

30:23.824 --> 30:25.909
You know, I'm gonna do the same.
You wanna join?

30:25.993 --> 30:27.828
Mess hall's your old stomping ground.

30:27.911 --> 30:29.413
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

30:29.496 --> 30:32.291
Nah, I'm good. You know, just settling in.

30:32.374 --> 30:34.376
Might get some rack time,
wait till breakfast.

30:34.459 --> 30:36.336
-Good to see you, Gordo.
-You too, Trace.

30:50.017 --> 30:54.062
...reports indicate a massive explosion
on the grounds of Fort Gulick,

30:54.146 --> 30:57.774
which is home to elements
of the United States 10th Infantry

30:57.858 --> 31:00.861
and some Special Forces units in Panama.

31:00.944 --> 31:05.240
Eyewitness reports describe a large truck,
which broke through the sentry post...

31:05.324 --> 31:06.408
Fucking animals.

31:06.491 --> 31:08.368
...and drove directly into the barracks
before exploding...

31:08.452 --> 31:09.870
Enchiladas are ready.

31:09.953 --> 31:11.788
Great. Starving.

31:12.331 --> 31:13.373
Could use another beer.

31:13.457 --> 31:15.834
...to stay out of the Canal Zone,

31:15.918 --> 31:19.546
which is sovereign US territory
under international law.

31:20.631 --> 31:22.966
What was supposed
to be a routine resupply mission

31:23.050 --> 31:24.468
to the Jamestown moon base

31:24.551 --> 31:27.721
has turned into another front
in the escalating war of words

31:27.804 --> 31:29.806
between the United States
and the Soviet Union.

31:29.890 --> 31:32.351
God-- What you doing creeping up on me?

31:32.434 --> 31:33.936
I've been standing right here.

31:34.728 --> 31:35.896
Very funny.

31:35.979 --> 31:38.565
...which NASA says
is a routine resupply mission,

31:38.649 --> 31:40.734
will actually be carrying nuclear--

31:41.443 --> 31:42.986
-I was watching that.
-You didn't see me.

31:43.070 --> 31:44.446
Of course I saw you.

31:44.530 --> 31:47.783
Does it not occur to you that I might have
other things on my fucking mind?

31:47.866 --> 31:50.160
Yeah. That occurred to me.

31:50.994 --> 31:53.580
It occurred to me two months ago
when you first got back,

31:53.664 --> 31:57.209
and you'd sit in the bathtub for hours
staring at the wall.

31:57.793 --> 32:00.629
Told myself, "She's got a lot on her mind.
I'll leave her be."

32:01.880 --> 32:05.259
Told myself that every time
you'd bite my head off for no reason.

32:05.342 --> 32:07.553
Or every time
you'd just sit there silently,

32:07.636 --> 32:09.555
not wanting to talk about anything.

32:11.849 --> 32:15.352
Well, I'm done leaving you be.
Okay? I'm done.

32:15.435 --> 32:17.813
Because there's something going on,
and you need to tell me what it is.

32:17.896 --> 32:20.315
-What? What do you want me to say?
-I want you to tell me the truth.

32:20.399 --> 32:23.235
I want you to tell me... the truth.

32:27.656 --> 32:30.117
I mean, whatever it is,
we'll get through it.

32:33.370 --> 32:34.705
I don't know if we will.

32:44.840 --> 32:48.594
I went out into that solar storm...

32:50.304 --> 32:51.763
after Wubbo.

32:53.557 --> 32:57.311
I did not stay in the lava tube.

32:59.354 --> 33:00.606
That was a lie.

33:04.318 --> 33:07.529
I was on the surface for an hour.

33:09.198 --> 33:10.616
Maybe more.

33:12.701 --> 33:16.288
He would have died if I didn't.

33:18.123 --> 33:19.333
Is that why...

33:31.053 --> 33:33.013
Called normal-tension glaucoma.

35:05.063 --> 35:06.064
Trace.

35:06.148 --> 35:08.108
Shit. Gordo, get in here.

35:08.192 --> 35:10.777
Get in here. Be quiet.
Close the door, all right?

35:12.279 --> 35:13.363
Christ.

35:14.740 --> 35:15.908
What you doing?

35:17.159 --> 35:21.246
Well, I cycle the air when I'm done,
and it just goes out in the great beyond.

35:21.955 --> 35:23.665
You see, and then the next day,

35:23.749 --> 35:26.293
if someone smells something weird,
they just think it's the food.

35:26.376 --> 35:27.961
That's genius.

35:29.379 --> 35:31.173
-How many more of those?
-Seven.

35:31.965 --> 35:34.092
Seven until--

35:34.176 --> 35:37.429
until Jimmy sends the new stash up
with the next supply run.

35:37.513 --> 35:39.973
Jimmy? You got Jimmy sending you
contraband to the moon?

35:40.057 --> 35:44.853
He hollows out this block of stinky cheese
and then puts it in a plastic bag.

35:44.937 --> 35:47.105
You know? He's a smart boy.

35:48.815 --> 35:50.984
That's a little too smart.

35:52.611 --> 35:55.239
Yeah, I really don't wanna know
where he picked that up.

35:57.574 --> 35:58.742
You gonna share that?

36:00.702 --> 36:02.204
Yeah, why not?

36:02.955 --> 36:04.373
You look good, Gordo.

36:05.123 --> 36:06.583
You look happy.

36:07.835 --> 36:08.836
Thanks.

36:08.919 --> 36:10.254
Yeah.

36:10.337 --> 36:12.381
I haven't seen you like this
in a long time.

36:14.258 --> 36:15.592
Turned a corner, I think.

36:15.676 --> 36:16.927
Yeah? How so?

36:23.767 --> 36:26.478
All right, well, unless you want this
to be your last cigarette

36:26.562 --> 36:29.314
for the next six months,
I suggest you start talking.

36:35.112 --> 36:37.072
Well, last time I was up here...

36:38.949 --> 36:39.992
I lost it.

36:41.034 --> 36:42.160
Lost my way.

36:43.412 --> 36:44.997
Started seeing things, and...

36:45.581 --> 36:47.833
I even tried to take my helmet off
while I was outside.

36:50.127 --> 36:51.628
Oh, my God.

36:51.712 --> 36:54.339
Dani broke her arm on purpose, Trace,

36:55.090 --> 36:58.093
so that Ed wouldn't have to tell Houston
to send me to the nuthouse.

37:08.145 --> 37:11.064
I'm sorry you had to
go through that alone, Gordo.

37:12.149 --> 37:13.734
Really wish you would've told me.

37:14.568 --> 37:15.861
You and me both.

37:16.528 --> 37:18.363
This place can take a toll on you.

37:18.447 --> 37:21.742
Even with all these people here,
it can still feel really...

37:23.243 --> 37:25.454
lonely, isolating.

37:25.537 --> 37:28.999
I can't imagine how much worse
it must've been when you were here.

37:29.082 --> 37:31.710
Spent the last ten years
thinking about it.

37:31.793 --> 37:34.213
Could never understand
what really happened.

37:35.756 --> 37:38.008
And then the other day

37:38.091 --> 37:40.844
I was... eavesdropping,
that's what I was doing,

37:40.928 --> 37:44.556
I was eavesdropping on you talking
to Jimmy about his sixth birthday.

37:44.640 --> 37:48.060
And you were saying something
about how that was a "happy time."

37:49.144 --> 37:52.606
And, click, it all just fell into place.

37:53.649 --> 37:56.944
What happened up here was nothing to do
with space or claustrophobia

37:57.027 --> 37:59.029
or losing my mind.

37:59.112 --> 38:01.406
See, I knew that when I got home,
I was moving out.

38:01.490 --> 38:03.200
That was just the beginning of the end.

38:04.243 --> 38:05.911
And I don't think I could handle it.

38:14.711 --> 38:19.633
I couldn't handle losing the most
important thing in the world to me.

38:21.969 --> 38:22.970
You.

38:24.054 --> 38:27.432
And it was all my fault.
I mean, you have your moments, but...

38:30.018 --> 38:31.019
Fuck you.

38:32.688 --> 38:35.148
I'm the one
that screwed up our marriage, Trace.

38:36.233 --> 38:40.195
The lying, the cheating,
not being there when you needed me.

38:40.279 --> 38:43.615
Even when I was there, I know I wasn't.

38:44.408 --> 38:45.450
I know that.

38:49.580 --> 38:50.998
And it all just came apart.

38:53.208 --> 38:57.337
And I heard you talking to Jimmy about
a happy time, and...

38:58.547 --> 39:02.259
I just knew right then in my heart that
I wouldn't ever have a happy time again

39:02.342 --> 39:03.844
until I was back with you.

39:05.721 --> 39:08.891
-Oh, Gordo.
-That's why I'm here, Trace.

39:11.101 --> 39:12.603
I'm here to get you back.

39:12.686 --> 39:14.104
Hell, I even told Sam.

39:16.356 --> 39:18.859
-I'm sorry, you what?
-To his face.

39:18.942 --> 39:21.820
I said, "I'm getting Tracy back, Sam."

39:27.075 --> 39:30.245
Oh, God, Gordo. What did he say?

39:30.329 --> 39:32.706
-He said--
-Goddamn it, Gordo.

39:32.789 --> 39:35.918
Wait, wait. He said...

39:37.586 --> 39:41.548
"Tracy is like a wild horse.

39:42.466 --> 39:44.301
No one's ever gonna catch her."

39:53.101 --> 39:54.353
Yeah.

39:55.729 --> 39:57.231
Is that what you think?

40:00.025 --> 40:03.070
I think no man, woman or beast
could ever catch you.

40:06.365 --> 40:07.908
Unless you wanna be caught.

40:21.463 --> 40:23.048
Catch me if you can.

40:32.975 --> 40:35.269
I don't know if you saw the d-mail
from NASA HQ

40:35.352 --> 40:37.396
asking about the Pathfinder
cost estimates?

40:38.105 --> 40:40.607
I did a quick budget analysis last night,
if it's helpful.

40:46.488 --> 40:47.531
I'd go with red.

40:48.782 --> 40:50.826
-What?
-He likes red.

40:52.369 --> 40:53.537
Who?

40:53.620 --> 40:55.247
Mr. Nikulov. Your first meeting.

40:55.330 --> 40:58.208
What does what he likes
have to do with anything?

41:00.002 --> 41:01.879
Nothing, I suppose.

41:01.962 --> 41:04.840
I'll get you that Pathfinder
budget analysis right away.

41:11.722 --> 41:14.057
-Morning.
-Morning.

41:15.851 --> 41:16.935
Nice color.

41:17.895 --> 41:18.937
This?

41:21.940 --> 41:24.943
Did you get a chance to review
the docking loads analysis?

41:25.027 --> 41:27.487
I did. They seem satisfactory.

41:27.571 --> 41:30.699
There's a new... directive from Moscow.

41:30.782 --> 41:32.451
The politburo has determined

41:32.534 --> 41:35.746
that the symbolism of the first handshake
is important

41:35.829 --> 41:37.539
and that it should be exactly...

41:42.544 --> 41:43.962
equidistant, that's the word.

41:44.046 --> 41:47.090
Equidistant between the two spacecraft.

41:47.174 --> 41:50.677
That way neither side is the host,
neither side is the visitor, you see?

41:52.763 --> 41:56.183
Well, the module is exactly
3.15 meters long,

41:56.266 --> 41:58.810
so the midpoint would be 1.575.

41:58.894 --> 42:03.565
Yes. Here... here.

42:04.358 --> 42:06.777
But that presents certain problems.

42:06.860 --> 42:07.903
Look.

42:11.281 --> 42:12.533
You be the Americans.

42:19.581 --> 42:23.669
Now, the midpoint is there.

42:23.752 --> 42:25.712
So-- Come on.

42:33.387 --> 42:35.973
In theory, if you give me your hand...

42:38.851 --> 42:42.437
Like that, so-- All seems good, no?

42:42.521 --> 42:44.273
No. Yes.

42:45.774 --> 42:46.859
Seems good.

42:47.860 --> 42:50.195
But the problem is that from this position

42:50.279 --> 42:53.323
we are blocking all views
from both Soyuz and Apollo.

42:53.407 --> 42:54.950
I suppose.

42:55.033 --> 42:57.703
Now, where will the camera go?
No one will see this.

43:01.123 --> 43:03.876
No point in doing a symbol of peace
if no one can see it.

43:04.710 --> 43:05.919
Okay.

43:06.003 --> 43:07.004
Well--

43:08.922 --> 43:10.966
If one side had to host...

43:11.049 --> 43:13.385
Moscow would prefer it be
the Soviet Union.

43:14.761 --> 43:16.930
And Washington would prefer it be Apollo.

43:22.186 --> 43:25.355
What if we just... flip a coin?

43:27.983 --> 43:29.109
That would be...

43:30.402 --> 43:31.820
acceptable.

43:31.904 --> 43:34.072
-Do you have one? Sorry.
-Yeah.

43:34.156 --> 43:37.117
-No pockets.
-Yes. I think so.

43:39.620 --> 43:40.829
Okay.

43:41.788 --> 43:42.789
You call it.

43:44.166 --> 43:45.292
Eagle.

43:49.671 --> 43:51.965
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, yeah, hold on.

43:55.344 --> 43:57.888
-I think it's on...
-Yeah.

43:57.971 --> 43:59.056
Under.

44:03.227 --> 44:07.481
Sorry, you're gonna have
to back up. I can't get...

44:09.191 --> 44:10.859
My pants are caught.

44:16.782 --> 44:21.370
Well, maybe I could get...

44:30.212 --> 44:31.630
Ms. Madison--

44:33.215 --> 44:34.216
Yes?

44:35.801 --> 44:39.930
Ms. Madison, there is a situation
I think you need to deal with.

44:47.145 --> 44:48.480
Excuse me.

44:52.025 --> 44:56.530
Bill Strausser quit.
And, evidently, you're the cause.

44:57.197 --> 45:00.742
Me? I didn't do anything.

45:00.826 --> 45:02.870
Well, you must've done something.

45:02.953 --> 45:06.415
"It became apparent today
after a conversation with Ms. Rosales

45:06.498 --> 45:08.542
that I do not have
the respect of my colleagues,

45:08.625 --> 45:11.253
and therefore I am unable to continue
in my position."

45:11.336 --> 45:13.839
-What the hell did you say to him?
-Nothing.

45:13.922 --> 45:16.049
What did you say to him?

45:18.051 --> 45:22.639
I mean, okay... I did call him...

45:26.059 --> 45:27.144
Peanut.

45:36.820 --> 45:39.072
I should have never told you that story.

45:39.156 --> 45:41.283
I was trying to be nice
and share a confident--

45:41.366 --> 45:43.285
It just popped out.
I didn't think it would make him quit.

45:43.368 --> 45:44.620
You didn't think.

45:45.245 --> 45:48.415
Bill Strausser is a valuable member
of this team

45:48.498 --> 45:52.544
who has given over 20 years
of loyal service to this agency,

45:52.628 --> 45:56.298
and he does not deserve to leave
because some dumb kid shot her mouth off

45:56.381 --> 45:57.758
and humiliated him!

45:58.717 --> 46:01.094
Convince him to come back...

46:02.930 --> 46:04.431
or find yourself another job.

46:08.435 --> 46:10.646
-Excuse me?
-Aleida, I stuck my neck out for you.

46:10.729 --> 46:13.941
-You owe me at least--
-I don't owe you a damn thing.

46:14.024 --> 46:15.943
-Calm down.
-No, don't tell me to calm down.

46:16.026 --> 46:17.903
You don't get to tell me anything, ever.

46:17.986 --> 46:19.905
If you wanna fire me, go ahead.
I don't care.

46:19.988 --> 46:21.615
I don't care.

46:22.574 --> 46:23.867
I see.

46:25.619 --> 46:27.246
This is what you do, isn't it?

46:27.329 --> 46:29.081
What? Stand up for myself?

46:29.164 --> 46:31.625
That's why you've been fired
from every job you've ever had.

46:31.708 --> 46:33.418
Going gets rough
and Aleida gets going, right?

46:33.502 --> 46:34.878
Fuck you.

46:34.962 --> 46:37.673
I think you're doing
a pretty good job of that yourself.

46:38.632 --> 46:40.425
You wanna blow this job, go right ahead.

46:40.509 --> 46:45.347
But if you wanna be an aerospace engineer,
this is the end of the road.

47:09.872 --> 47:13.667
And with answers ranging
in value from $100 to $500 in--

47:20.841 --> 47:21.842
Hi.

47:23.677 --> 47:24.928
Could I come in and--

47:25.012 --> 47:27.347
Wait, no. I just wanna talk.

47:27.431 --> 47:30.601
-I don't wanna talk to you.
-Just for a few minutes. Five minutes.

47:30.684 --> 47:32.269
Please, Bill. Come on.

47:34.897 --> 47:36.190
Yeah, all right. Come on.

47:37.274 --> 47:39.484
Goddamn it, I missed it. I knew it.

47:49.369 --> 47:52.206
Is that a real commlock from Space: 1999?

47:53.916 --> 47:56.835
I gave a tour of MOCR to Barbara Bain
a few years ago,

47:56.919 --> 47:58.879
and she sent that as a thank-you.

47:58.962 --> 48:01.590
Is that Buzz Aldrin's glove?

48:01.673 --> 48:04.885
I'm not giving you a tour.
What do you want?

48:08.138 --> 48:11.058
I'm here 'cause I wanted to say...

48:13.185 --> 48:14.186
I'm sorry.

48:16.855 --> 48:19.149
Fine. Thanks for coming by.

48:20.400 --> 48:23.320
So, are you gonna come back to work? Or...

48:23.403 --> 48:24.404
Nope.

48:24.947 --> 48:26.657
Please, Bill. Come on.
It was just one moment.

48:26.740 --> 48:30.035
Just a dumb thing to say,
and I'll never ever say it again.

48:30.118 --> 48:32.329
You think it's about that?

48:32.412 --> 48:35.332
I've been dealing with this story
for almost 20 years.

48:36.083 --> 48:38.877
You're barely at NASA a month?
You've already heard.

48:39.962 --> 48:42.798
Do you even know
what Gemini mission it was?

48:42.881 --> 48:45.634
What was going on
when Bill peed his pants?

48:46.510 --> 48:48.011
-It doesn't matter.
-Yes, it does.

48:48.095 --> 48:50.973
-Really...
-It's March 16th, 1966. Gemini 8.

48:51.557 --> 48:52.808
That mean anything to you?

48:53.684 --> 48:55.018
Yeah, sure.

48:58.146 --> 49:04.111
Neil Armstrong and David Scott
started tumbling and spinning in orbit,

49:04.194 --> 49:05.445
and they nearly blacked out.

49:05.529 --> 49:07.072
Nearly died.

49:07.155 --> 49:08.949
If they black out, it's over.

49:10.242 --> 49:14.538
Now, I'm on console, about to go off duty,
and, yeah, I had to pee.

49:15.414 --> 49:18.166
And suddenly Neil is saying
he's lost control of the spacecraft,

49:18.250 --> 49:20.169
and it's getting worse.

49:20.252 --> 49:23.046
And we might lose
two of the first Americans in space.

49:23.130 --> 49:26.175
So I stayed at my post.

49:27.551 --> 49:29.720
Even after Neil regained control.

49:29.803 --> 49:32.055
We didn't know how badly damaged
the capsule was.

49:32.139 --> 49:35.184
So I stayed... with everyone.

49:37.561 --> 49:39.938
Waiting and watching

49:40.856 --> 49:42.149
and hoping

49:42.900 --> 49:44.109
and praying.

49:46.862 --> 49:48.947
You know they had to reenter over China?

49:50.532 --> 49:53.577
Yeah, we don't have
any tracking stations in China.

49:53.660 --> 49:56.205
So when we lost their signal,
it wasn't for a few minutes.

49:56.288 --> 49:57.497
It was an hour.

49:59.124 --> 50:03.670
Until an air force pilot saw their chutes
deploy over Okinawa.

50:07.257 --> 50:10.928
We got word that they splashed down,
and they were okay.

50:11.011 --> 50:14.097
We jumped up. And we cheered.

50:18.393 --> 50:22.564
It was the first time I'd ever been part
of a moment like that.

50:25.651 --> 50:27.945
And I'm standing there, cheering.

50:29.571 --> 50:33.659
And Frank Bedlow looks at me and says,

50:33.742 --> 50:37.496
"Bill, did you pee your pants?"

50:40.624 --> 50:44.169
People still talk about it
20 goddamn years later.

50:55.180 --> 50:56.431
I...

50:57.808 --> 50:58.892
was shot.

50:59.977 --> 51:01.562
-What?
-Shotgun.

51:01.645 --> 51:07.150
Rock salt, but
there was some bird shot in it too.

51:09.319 --> 51:11.488
There's still some of it in my shoulder--

51:11.572 --> 51:13.490
Look, I don't know
what you're trying to do--

51:13.574 --> 51:14.950
Just hear me out.

51:16.118 --> 51:17.160
Okay?

51:22.457 --> 51:27.004
There was a time in my life where...
I didn't have anywhere to live.

51:28.547 --> 51:29.631
Nowhere.

51:30.257 --> 51:32.384
Occasionally I would crash
on friends' couches,

51:32.467 --> 51:37.264
but it was mostly underpasses,
park benches. Some backyards.

51:37.347 --> 51:40.893
Some backyards are so big, people don't
know what's going on back there anyway.

51:44.188 --> 51:46.940
I had to eat. Obviously.

51:48.734 --> 51:50.277
But I had no money.

51:52.613 --> 51:53.822
So, I would...

51:55.282 --> 51:57.910
scavenge behind restaurants for food.

51:58.619 --> 52:02.164
There's this restaurant on Bryant Street
that had some really good stuff,

52:02.247 --> 52:03.457
so I would go back there,

52:04.291 --> 52:07.419
and the owner would come out,
and he would just yell at me.

52:08.795 --> 52:10.589
"Get out of here, you wetback.

52:11.590 --> 52:13.759
You're stinking up the neighborhood.
Get a job."

52:14.885 --> 52:16.678
So, one day, I'm back there.

52:16.762 --> 52:21.558
The guy comes out.
And this time... he's got a gun.

52:25.270 --> 52:27.439
I don't even remember getting shot.

52:28.941 --> 52:32.486
I just remember this loud noise
and being on the ground

52:32.569 --> 52:34.821
and then just getting up and running.

52:36.782 --> 52:37.950
Just kept running.

52:39.701 --> 52:40.869
Stopped in the park.

52:43.997 --> 52:49.378
And that's when I realized that...
blood was soaking my shirt.

52:50.587 --> 52:54.299
And the left side of my body
felt like it was on fire.

52:56.677 --> 52:58.178
Jesus.

53:00.973 --> 53:06.144
So I went to the emergency room,
and they cleaned me up.

53:06.228 --> 53:09.356
And I told them what happened,
and they called the police.

53:09.439 --> 53:11.567
'Cause that's what you do
when someone gets shot.

53:11.650 --> 53:13.318
You call the police.

53:14.736 --> 53:17.573
But I was here illegally,
and I didn't want to talk to the police.

53:17.656 --> 53:18.782
So I just...

53:20.284 --> 53:21.285
left.

53:22.369 --> 53:27.165
I left before they got
all the bird shot out.

53:27.249 --> 53:29.751
So I still have a lot of it in there.

53:29.835 --> 53:34.423
I have these big, ugly...

53:36.884 --> 53:37.968
scars...

53:39.887 --> 53:41.054
all through there.

53:43.765 --> 53:49.188
So... I don't wear any tank tops

53:49.271 --> 53:53.233
or bathing suits or halter tops
or any of that shit.

53:56.570 --> 53:57.738
Nobody gets to see that.

54:03.035 --> 54:04.036
So...

54:05.913 --> 54:09.750
I have my own shame, Bill.

54:12.461 --> 54:14.087
And believe me when I say that...

54:16.548 --> 54:18.217
I'm really sorry...

54:19.343 --> 54:23.305
I made you feel yours all over again.

54:28.310 --> 54:30.229
Screen Actors Guild is absolutely right.

54:30.312 --> 54:32.564
World Leaders for 200.

54:32.648 --> 54:34.650
The answer:
Britain's first female prime minister.

54:34.733 --> 54:37.027
Her popularity soared
after the Falklands War. Larry.

54:37.110 --> 54:38.153
It's Margaret Thatcher.

54:38.237 --> 54:40.030
-Who is Margaret Thatcher?
-Right.

54:40.113 --> 54:43.367
-Let's try Hot Movies for 400.
-Needs to be in the form of a question.

54:46.662 --> 54:47.788
Fuck you.

54:47.871 --> 54:49.873
-You're right.
-Hot Movies for 300.

54:49.957 --> 54:53.168
The male stars
tested their disguises for this '59 film

54:53.252 --> 54:55.128
by visiting the studio ladies' room.
Larry.

54:55.212 --> 54:57.422
-What is Some Like It Hot?
-Some Like It Hot. Yes.

54:57.506 --> 54:58.757
Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis.

54:58.841 --> 55:01.426
They must've had a lot of fun going to
the ladies' rooms dressed up that way,

55:01.510 --> 55:03.262
but we'll talk about that
on some other show.

55:03.345 --> 55:04.888
Right now, Larry, make a selection.

55:13.647 --> 55:15.732
Okay. I have your tips ready.

55:18.360 --> 55:19.736
21.50.

55:20.988 --> 55:24.783
-Not a bad night.
-No, that's great. Thank you.

55:26.368 --> 55:28.245
I just wanted to say...

55:30.080 --> 55:31.290
about the other night...

55:32.332 --> 55:35.210
-Yeah, I don't really know what happened.
-Nothing happened.

55:36.753 --> 55:37.754
Right.

55:37.838 --> 55:40.591
Two friends had a nice moment...

55:41.425 --> 55:43.635
and shared a friendly kiss.

55:46.305 --> 55:49.766
Maybe it was a little more friendly than
it should have been, but...

55:49.850 --> 55:50.851
Yeah.

55:51.852 --> 55:52.895
Sorry.

55:56.064 --> 55:57.149
Don't be sorry.

56:01.278 --> 56:03.864
We can move on.
We don't have to keep talking about it.

56:03.947 --> 56:05.115
Right.

56:08.744 --> 56:10.871
-Good night, Danny.
-Good night, Mrs. Baldwin.

56:19.046 --> 56:20.297
Thought you were leaving.

56:21.965 --> 56:22.966
I don't...

56:24.468 --> 56:26.011
I don't know what to say.

56:27.888 --> 56:29.973
I know we're supposed to...

56:31.767 --> 56:34.603
forget about what happened.

56:34.686 --> 56:35.771
But I...

56:37.356 --> 56:38.565
I can't.

56:39.733 --> 56:41.735
I just keep thinking about it.

56:43.946 --> 56:45.155
Your hair...

56:46.198 --> 56:47.241
-and your lips.
-Danny.

56:47.324 --> 56:49.535
All I can do is think about
holding you in my arms.

56:49.618 --> 56:50.786
Stop talking.

56:52.538 --> 56:53.539
Stop talking.

57:03.882 --> 57:05.592
Go lock the door.

57:05.676 --> 57:07.219
Turn off the lights.

57:08.262 --> 57:09.596
Come meet me downstairs.

57:15.143 --> 57:16.520
Go. Now.

57:46.884 --> 57:48.385
You really gonna sell this place?

57:49.887 --> 57:51.305
Lock, stock and barrel.

57:53.098 --> 57:55.184
Gonna be weird,
someone else owning the Outpost.

57:56.727 --> 57:59.980
First day I ever came here,
day you had the grand opening.

58:00.772 --> 58:01.857
Yeah?

58:02.858 --> 58:04.193
That was a fun day.

58:05.152 --> 58:07.696
It was a total disaster.

58:07.779 --> 58:11.617
I remember the beer taps wouldn't work,
the toilets overflowed.

58:11.700 --> 58:15.537
It was... a mess. But fun.

58:18.498 --> 58:21.793
So, is it just not... fun anymore?

58:24.254 --> 58:25.589
That's a good way to put it.

58:29.551 --> 58:30.886
People love it though.

58:32.471 --> 58:36.433
They do. They come in here,
and they look at the space pictures

58:36.517 --> 58:37.976
and the space models.

58:38.060 --> 58:40.395
Anything that has
anything to do with space.

58:41.104 --> 58:43.774
Yeah, I see it in their faces
when they come through the door.

58:44.483 --> 58:47.819
They look around, like,
"There any astronauts in here?"

58:49.738 --> 58:51.865
"Did that piece of crap
really go to space?"

58:53.033 --> 58:54.618
"Is that space crap?"

58:56.203 --> 58:57.871
I swear I could sell actual crap.

58:57.955 --> 59:00.999
Just a ziplock bag filled
with it, if I said it had been to space.

59:01.083 --> 59:02.918
Yeah, I don't doubt it.

59:03.752 --> 59:04.795
Why?

59:05.712 --> 59:07.297
Everyone wants to go to space.

59:08.632 --> 59:10.801
Not me. Never have.

59:10.884 --> 59:12.886
Well, everyone but you.

59:15.097 --> 59:17.808
But... most people never will.

59:17.891 --> 59:21.979
So coming here, buying some goofy trinket

59:22.062 --> 59:24.356
is the closest they'll ever come
to the real thing.

59:25.691 --> 59:27.401
Till NASA starts selling tickets.

59:30.612 --> 59:32.030
NASA's never gonna do that.

59:32.114 --> 59:34.783
They would never
sell tickets to space, right?

59:36.618 --> 59:38.245
I highly doubt it.

59:41.164 --> 59:42.249
Someone will.

59:43.041 --> 59:44.501
And they're gonna make a killing.

59:44.585 --> 59:45.586
Karen.

59:47.045 --> 59:48.255
You called me Karen.

59:49.423 --> 59:50.549
I love you.

59:53.802 --> 59:55.512
No, you don't, Danny. No, you don't.

59:55.596 --> 59:56.972
-Yes, I do.
-No, you don't.

59:57.055 --> 59:59.266
I... I love you, Karen.

1:00:01.894 --> 1:00:05.522
Okay. Let's get a grip here.

1:00:06.648 --> 1:00:08.442
You're all that I think about.

1:00:09.067 --> 1:00:10.068
No.

1:00:10.152 --> 1:00:13.238
-I've been in love with you for years now.
-What? No. That's not what this is.

1:00:13.322 --> 1:00:14.615
-Yeah.
-No, no, no.

1:00:14.698 --> 1:00:17.451
I'll leave the academy.
We can find a place to live in the city.

1:00:17.534 --> 1:00:18.535
What?

1:00:18.619 --> 1:00:21.371
Danny, that's not what this is.

1:00:21.455 --> 1:00:23.081
This is not love.

1:00:23.665 --> 1:00:25.834
-It's not going any further.
-What?

1:00:25.918 --> 1:00:28.462
-I thought we just had--
-We had a really great time.

1:00:29.671 --> 1:00:32.549
We did. It was really, really great, okay?

1:00:32.633 --> 1:00:36.845
And it was something
that we both wanted and needed maybe.

1:00:36.929 --> 1:00:37.930
I don't...

1:00:38.013 --> 1:00:40.557
I mean, I know I wanted it.
And I needed it.

1:00:40.641 --> 1:00:41.642
And so I did it.

1:00:43.268 --> 1:00:45.103
And it was great.

1:00:46.271 --> 1:00:48.774
Hey. You were great.

1:00:51.818 --> 1:00:53.153
You were great, sweetie.

1:00:57.032 --> 1:00:58.158
But it's over.

1:00:58.742 --> 1:00:59.743
-No.
-It's over.

1:00:59.826 --> 1:01:01.453
-It doesn't have to be.
-Yes, it does.

1:01:01.537 --> 1:01:04.414
-Why?
-Because I said so, okay?

1:01:04.498 --> 1:01:05.832
It's over. Get dressed.

1:01:08.961 --> 1:01:11.839
Just-- You should leave
out the back door, all right?

1:01:11.922 --> 1:01:15.008
Just lock it behind you
like you're the last one that was here.

1:01:15.092 --> 1:01:16.718
And I'll leave later on.

1:01:17.553 --> 1:01:20.556
Just get in your car and you drive home.

1:01:24.142 --> 1:01:25.727
Call in sick tomorrow though.

1:01:25.811 --> 1:01:28.605
And you leave for the academy
at the end of the week anyway.

1:01:29.898 --> 1:01:31.817
Don't worry. I'll get you
your last week's paycheck.

1:01:31.900 --> 1:01:33.277
I don't care about any of that.

1:01:41.368 --> 1:01:42.411
About-face.

1:01:43.620 --> 1:01:44.621
That's an order.

1:01:57.551 --> 1:01:59.678
Don't turn back. Just go.

1:02:26.830 --> 1:02:28.040
Oh, my God.

1:02:35.923 --> 1:02:38.383
357 Bravo, LSAM 2,

1:02:38.967 --> 1:02:41.428
I am five minutes out
with your relief crew.

1:02:41.512 --> 1:02:43.222
Copy that, LSAM 2.

1:02:43.305 --> 1:02:46.141
Looking forward to some hot chow
and a shower.

1:02:46.225 --> 1:02:49.895
Captain Stevens,
you ready for some stick time?

1:02:53.565 --> 1:02:54.775
Roger that.

1:02:57.778 --> 1:03:00.906
All right. Switching to PLT.
You have the vehicle.

1:03:03.617 --> 1:03:05.786
A lot of lag in the RCS thrusters.

1:03:06.537 --> 1:03:08.872
Man, she does not respond
like she used to.

1:03:13.293 --> 1:03:17.631
Okay, boys and girls, please return
your tray tables and your seat backs

1:03:17.714 --> 1:03:19.967
to their upright and locked positions.

1:03:33.939 --> 1:03:37.484
Next mining crew is set to arrive
at 1130 hours to start.

1:03:38.986 --> 1:03:40.696
-Movement.
-What?

1:03:41.655 --> 1:03:42.656
Where?

1:03:42.739 --> 1:03:45.951
Ten o'clock. I saw something flash
at the top of that ridge.

1:03:49.454 --> 1:03:52.541
Are you sure?
I don't see movement anywhere up there.

1:03:53.792 --> 1:03:56.378
Wait. Got it.

1:03:56.962 --> 1:03:57.963
We got company.

1:03:58.755 --> 1:04:00.549
Wilhelm, hold the fort.

1:04:01.216 --> 1:04:04.344
Webster, Lopez, come with me.

1:04:12.686 --> 1:04:14.188
Houston, MARDET actual.

1:04:14.271 --> 1:04:17.024
We've got unfriendlies
on the ridge over 357 Bravo.

1:04:17.107 --> 1:04:19.067
Heading up to check it out.

1:04:19.151 --> 1:04:21.028
Copy that. Approach with caution.

1:04:21.111 --> 1:04:25.073
Once you have them in your sight, attempt
to contact on their radio frequency.

1:04:26.867 --> 1:04:28.243
Will comply, Houston.

1:04:32.623 --> 1:04:35.334
Heads up, eyes open. Spread out.

1:04:41.006 --> 1:04:42.257
Clear on the right.

1:04:43.300 --> 1:04:45.093
Webster, cover left.

1:04:45.886 --> 1:04:48.138
Roger left. Holding.

1:04:48.805 --> 1:04:49.806
Moving.

1:04:50.974 --> 1:04:53.602
Left is clear. Crossing right.

1:04:54.228 --> 1:04:56.772
Gotcha. Taking left flank.

1:04:57.356 --> 1:04:58.524
Still nothing.

1:05:07.032 --> 1:05:09.076
Houston. Contact, front.

1:05:09.785 --> 1:05:10.786
What've you got?

1:05:10.869 --> 1:05:14.790
I see two cosmonauts
working on some kind of equipment.

1:05:14.873 --> 1:05:16.124
They haven't spotted us yet.

1:05:16.208 --> 1:05:17.876
Lopez, you see any more of them?

1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:20.295
Negative, skipper. Just these two.

1:05:20.379 --> 1:05:22.172
Houston, your call.

1:05:22.256 --> 1:05:25.133
MARDET 1,
switch to Russian communication frequency

1:05:25.217 --> 1:05:27.553
and order them to vacate immediately.

1:05:27.636 --> 1:05:28.679
Wilco.

1:05:28.762 --> 1:05:30.722
Webster, take point.

1:05:30.806 --> 1:05:33.141
Get on their freq
and tell these guys to get lost.

1:05:33.934 --> 1:05:35.352
Lopez, keep her covered.

1:05:35.435 --> 1:05:36.520
Roger.

1:05:36.603 --> 1:05:38.480
Switching frequencies.

1:05:39.022 --> 1:05:42.025
Attention Soviet Cosmonauts.

1:05:43.026 --> 1:05:47.239
This area is claimed
by the United States government.

1:06:01.336 --> 1:06:02.462
They're moving.

1:06:04.047 --> 1:06:05.215
I got 'em.

1:06:05.966 --> 1:06:07.134
Stay cool, guys.

1:06:19.771 --> 1:06:23.192
I don't like this. What's he doing?

1:06:23.275 --> 1:06:25.903
What's in that case? Is that a gun?

1:06:25.986 --> 1:06:28.697
Stop! Step away from the case.

1:06:33.911 --> 1:06:35.454
Shots fired. Shots fired.

1:06:36.121 --> 1:06:37.122
Enemy down.

1:06:37.206 --> 1:06:40.125
You, stay away from the case.

1:06:45.506 --> 1:06:47.382
Shit. Go, go, go.

1:06:48.425 --> 1:06:49.468
Goddamn it.

1:06:50.260 --> 1:06:52.471
MARDET 1, Houston.

1:06:52.554 --> 1:06:54.264
MARDET 1, sitrep.

1:06:54.932 --> 1:06:57.643
Houston, two hostiles down.
And it's bad.

1:06:58.435 --> 1:06:59.728
Wait one.

1:07:01.772 --> 1:07:04.274
Jesus. This guy's on fire.

1:07:04.358 --> 1:07:05.526
Holy shit.

1:07:06.109 --> 1:07:07.736
Jesus. What do I do?

1:07:09.238 --> 1:07:10.280
Hold on, buddy.

1:07:10.364 --> 1:07:12.866
You got a hole in your suit,
but we're gonna patch you up.

1:07:12.950 --> 1:07:15.327
Webster, Lopez. Sound off.

1:07:15.410 --> 1:07:18.205
-I'm good.
-I'm good.

1:07:18.288 --> 1:07:20.958
Breathe, buddy, breathe.
You're gonna be okay.

1:07:21.041 --> 1:07:22.584
-Stevens?
-Copy, Vance.

1:07:22.668 --> 1:07:24.545
This guy needs a medevac, ASAP.

1:07:24.628 --> 1:07:25.546
Fuck me.

1:07:26.129 --> 1:07:29.258
We're on the ridge.
About 300 meters in from the crest.

1:07:31.426 --> 1:07:33.637
Copy your position. Be there in a flash.

1:07:33.720 --> 1:07:35.806
Webster, secure their weapons.

1:07:36.890 --> 1:07:38.308
Aye, aye.

1:07:38.392 --> 1:07:40.686
MARDET 1, Houston. What's your situation?

1:07:41.728 --> 1:07:44.857
I say again, MARDET 1. Houston.
Request status update.

1:07:50.821 --> 1:07:54.449
Houston, MARDET actual.

1:07:54.533 --> 1:07:56.076
Site is secure.

1:07:56.159 --> 1:07:59.329
We have two enemy casualties.
One dead, one wounded.

1:07:59.413 --> 1:08:00.664
Medevac inbound.

1:08:01.415 --> 1:08:02.499
Get the White House.

1:08:11.383 --> 1:08:14.011
Jesus. Skipper.

1:08:15.262 --> 1:08:16.721
What is it?

1:08:16.805 --> 1:08:18.223
There are no weapons.

1:08:19.183 --> 1:08:20.642
Then what were they reaching for?

1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:24.020
Oh, my God.
