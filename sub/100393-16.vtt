WEBVTT

00:07.964 --> 00:08.965
Previously on "All Rise"...

00:09.009 --> 00:10.227
Meet our newest clerk

00:10.271 --> 00:11.359
Mr. Luke Watkins,
coming straight

00:11.402 --> 00:12.621
from Courtroom 802!

00:12.664 --> 00:14.449
I'm running
for State Attorney General.

00:14.492 --> 00:15.580
Benner's worried
about opposition research,

00:15.624 --> 00:16.799
so she turns to you?

00:16.842 --> 00:18.061
A toxic class action
stood out.

00:18.105 --> 00:20.324
Was that against
Cubrillon Industries?

00:20.368 --> 00:21.804
I should just forget
the whole thing

00:21.847 --> 00:23.023
is what I should do.
- Yeah.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.546
Have you talked
to opposing counsel yet?

00:24.589 --> 00:26.983
Jean Rubenstone-Frost.
She represented the workers.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.464
I was hoping you had
a few minutes to talk

00:29.507 --> 00:31.509
about Cubrillon Industries.

00:38.212 --> 00:40.649
Keys and cell phone
in the bin, please.

00:41.780 --> 00:44.131
- Hey.
- Oh.

00:44.174 --> 00:45.436
Sara.
You are a lifesaver.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.395
If I don't get
some caffeine stat,

00:47.438 --> 00:49.136
let's just say there'll be
some interesting spelling

00:49.179 --> 00:50.833
in today's transcripts.

00:50.876 --> 00:52.704
Oh, I bet. You were up
late last night.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.184
Oh, my God.
You were home?

00:54.228 --> 00:55.925
I thought you were
over at Luke's.

00:55.968 --> 00:58.797
Case in chief starts today.
I needed to clear my head.

00:58.841 --> 01:00.190
- Are you guys...
- Uh-uh.

01:00.234 --> 01:01.409
You do notget to change
the subject.

01:01.452 --> 01:04.412
You had a guest
an overnight guest. Who?

01:04.455 --> 01:06.762
Century Bar after work.

01:06.805 --> 01:09.112
I sat next
to this cute lawyer

01:09.156 --> 01:10.461
Ben. New in town.

01:10.505 --> 01:13.856
He was alone. I was alone.
He bought me a drink.

01:13.899 --> 01:16.728
He gave me
this amazing smile,

01:16.772 --> 01:19.688
and then...
coup de foudre.

01:19.731 --> 01:23.344
This new look
is doing its work!

01:23.387 --> 01:25.172
It really is.

01:25.215 --> 01:27.565
That sounds so fun.
You gonna see him again?

01:27.609 --> 01:29.611
We were in such a rush
this morning,

01:29.654 --> 01:31.613
we forgot
to exchange numbers.

01:31.656 --> 01:33.615
Well, what firm
is he with?

01:33.658 --> 01:36.096
That's okay. We can
Google him. Ben last name?

01:36.139 --> 01:38.533
Uh, we were very
spontaneous.

01:38.576 --> 01:41.144
I don't actually know.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.189
You don't know?

01:42.232 --> 01:44.191
Oh. This is me.

01:44.234 --> 01:48.151
Wait. Can you get me
an almond milk latte? Large.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.632
Oh, Marky Mark.

01:50.675 --> 01:52.286
How's it coming
with your big psychic case?

01:52.329 --> 01:53.983
It's in the bag.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.767
The last day of the trial.
Defendant's gonna testify,

01:55.811 --> 01:58.074
and we are going to shred
her credibility.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.032
I'm glad to see
your wrist is doing better.

02:00.076 --> 02:02.948
Yeah.Maybe you should lay off
the figure skating for a while.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.167
That's not

02:04.211 --> 02:06.169
Is Amy telling everyone
that's what hap

02:06.213 --> 02:07.431
How's your wingman Luke?

02:07.475 --> 02:10.259
- Goose to my Maverick.
- Cool.

02:10.304 --> 02:12.828
Wait. Didn't Maverick
get Goose killed?

02:14.395 --> 02:16.092
Your gain, our loss.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.225
We've got Deputy Van Vynck
covering in 802.

02:18.268 --> 02:20.749
Oh.
That man is
no Luke Watkins.

02:20.792 --> 02:23.317
It's just,
I've been watching the jury,

02:23.360 --> 02:25.536
and they think
this is a joke.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.495
They don't.
We won't let them.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.366
- I feel so stupid.
- You weren't stupid.

02:29.410 --> 02:30.802
You were a victim
of extortion,

02:30.846 --> 02:32.282
and you're not alone.
She conned a lot of people.

02:32.326 --> 02:33.979
But we're here to make sure
the jury knows that.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.633
I think I need
to stress-eat.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.898
You ready to go in there,
get the big win?

02:39.942 --> 02:41.857
The guy is down
on his luck,

02:41.900 --> 02:43.293
heartbroken
after his divorce,

02:43.337 --> 02:44.773
and a so-called psychic
comes in

02:44.816 --> 02:46.383
and takes advantage of him.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.645
And all those other people
people just looking

02:47.689 --> 02:49.125
for a reason to hope.
Who does that?

02:49.169 --> 02:50.474
Love the passion,

02:50.518 --> 02:52.650
but don't get too caught up
in your casework.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.174
Do as I say, not as I do.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.219
All right. You gonna
help me with this cross?

02:56.263 --> 02:57.873
Let's do it. Oh.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.573
Shoot.

03:04.749 --> 03:07.230
 I'm not entirely sure
what we're doing here.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.797
This should have been
a plea deal.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.581
My client wanted a trial.
That's his constitutional right.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.104
Your client who doesn't
believe in the Constitution,

03:12.148 --> 03:13.497
who shot at two officers.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.151
Who were trying
to kick him off his land.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.587
They were serving him a notice
that his land was being seized

03:16.631 --> 03:18.459
because he's refused
to pay state taxes

03:18.502 --> 03:19.938
for the last 20 years.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.810
He did not shoot at them.
He fired warning shots.

03:21.853 --> 03:23.594
- Ballistics evidence.
- Is scientifically unsound.

03:23.638 --> 03:26.423
I admire your tenacity,
but this one's a lost cause.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.730
Well, lost causes are
my specialty.Ahem!

03:28.773 --> 03:31.123
- Almond milk latte.
- Oh, thank God. Thank you.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.865
Did you even read the report
my expert sent you?

03:33.909 --> 03:36.303
Of course I read it, Emily.
I read all expert materials.

03:40.437 --> 03:42.700
Oh! Moonlighting
for Postmates?

03:42.744 --> 03:45.094
Testifying in
Judge Carmichael's court today,

03:45.137 --> 03:48.489
so I, um, thought I'd, well,
surprise Ms. Kansky

03:48.532 --> 03:50.055
with some breakfast.

03:50.099 --> 03:53.581
Still calling her
"Ms. Kansky." Kinky.

03:53.624 --> 03:54.930
This way, Detective Harris.

03:54.973 --> 03:57.237
Sherri, you have a visitor.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.673
I come bearing pastries.

03:58.716 --> 04:01.023
Mm.
New French bakery
down by Grand Central.

04:01.066 --> 04:02.329
Wasn't expecting to see you.

04:02.372 --> 04:03.982
You knew
I'd be testifying.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.593
I generally don't breakfast
with material witnesses.

04:05.636 --> 04:07.812
You said the other nightYou didn't text.
I already ate.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.510
You didn't ask
if I have time. I do not,

04:09.553 --> 04:11.947
and you unilaterally decided
to introduce a new bakery,

04:11.990 --> 04:13.949
and I hate trying
new things.

04:15.124 --> 04:17.168
I'm sorry. I don't mean...

04:17.213 --> 04:18.301
That sounded harsh.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.519
I just

04:19.563 --> 04:21.738
I have a really full plate
this morning.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.088
- I just thought
- We have a routine.

04:23.132 --> 04:25.003
Almond croissant at Lou's
every Monday morning.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.353
It's a good routine.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.746
Let's not mess
with perfection, okay?

04:30.052 --> 04:31.227
I'm sorry.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.756
For the record,
that new bakery

04:38.800 --> 04:40.323
amazing.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.065
Ow.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.588
I know you can't control

04:44.632 --> 04:46.808
when an emergency
assignment pops up.

04:46.851 --> 04:49.027
I was just really looking
forward to seeing you,

04:49.071 --> 04:50.942
especially since that blizzard
messed up last weekend.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.466
It's killing me, too,
believe me.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.945
Getting called
into a meeting.

04:53.989 --> 04:56.339
I'm sorry, baby.
I love you.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.776
Talk to you later.
I love you, too.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.343
I didn't know
you were on the phone.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.998
It's fine. Travel hiccups.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.000
Wonderful. I'll let her
know you're here.

05:06.871 --> 05:08.612
Judge Benner is here
to see you.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.832
Judge Benner?
She is supposedSupposed to be across town

05:10.875 --> 05:12.312
in meetings for her
Attorney General campaign

05:12.355 --> 05:14.401
while you're here talking
to Jean Rubenstone-Frost.

05:14.444 --> 05:17.055
Yeah.
But instead, she's here.

05:19.536 --> 05:23.410
Sara, have you met
my son Ben?

05:23.453 --> 05:26.326
Your name is Ben Benner.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.459
Have I seen you
somewhere before?

05:29.503 --> 05:32.419
Uh, church, maybe?
You a Methodist?

05:32.462 --> 05:33.985
My meetings
got rescheduled,

05:34.029 --> 05:36.161
so I thought I'd grab
breakfast with Ben.

05:36.205 --> 05:38.686
Then I'm gonna plow through
my backlog of paperwork.

05:38.729 --> 05:39.904
Oh, speaking of which,

05:39.948 --> 05:41.558
I need Judge Carmichael's
John Hancock

05:41.602 --> 05:43.604
on the requisition form
- Let's get her signing, then.

05:43.647 --> 05:44.561
Okay.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.258
Hello again.

05:46.302 --> 05:48.522
I wasn't expectingYou didn't mention
your mom was

05:48.565 --> 05:49.566
Didn't really seem
the appropriate time

05:49.610 --> 05:51.133
to bring up my mom.

05:51.176 --> 05:53.440
More a third date
kind of conversation.

05:53.483 --> 05:56.007
Fair enough.I guess that puts us
ahead of schedule.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.531
Maybe we should get
back on track.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.228
Second date tonight?

05:59.271 --> 06:01.404
Uh, what did you have
in mind?

06:02.797 --> 06:04.320
Jean Rubenstone-Frost.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.365
So good.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.192
Ben. It's Ben, right?

06:07.236 --> 06:09.194
Have you met
Judge Carmichael?

06:09.238 --> 06:10.631
Um...

06:10.674 --> 06:13.547
Well, that's all
taken care of.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.810
Right, the progeny.
Lola Carmichael,

06:15.853 --> 06:18.073
underneath all that beard
is my son Ben.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.031
Nice to meet you.
Ben Benner.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.382
Your Honor, I've heard
a lot about you.

06:22.425 --> 06:25.559
No, he hasn't. We were
just headed to breakfast.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.256
Oh, good. Great.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.913
Well, you two get
on out of here. Enjoy.

06:31.956 --> 06:34.437
Ben, it was lovely
to meet you.

06:34.481 --> 06:37.701
Uh, I hear the bakery
near Grand Central is amazing.

06:37.745 --> 06:40.617
Crisis averted.
Your visitor is here,

06:40.661 --> 06:42.663
and Benner
is none the wiser.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.621
All this cloak and dagger,
it just feels wrong.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.232
I just spent the last
two days making calls,

06:47.276 --> 06:49.278
rearranging your schedule
to accommodate this meeting.

06:49.321 --> 06:52.237
I just did a somersault
to get Benner out of here.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.762
If you back out nowNo! I know.

06:54.805 --> 06:55.763
And after what that
Cubrillon employee told me

06:55.806 --> 06:56.981
about Benner's old firm,

06:57.025 --> 06:59.331
the strong-arm tactics
and the documents,

06:59.375 --> 07:00.898
I know
I need to find out more.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.466
Come in.

07:03.510 --> 07:06.121
She was, um,
concerned about time.

07:06.164 --> 07:07.557
Jean Rubenstone-Frost.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.516
Not every day a judge calls
to ask about a case

07:09.559 --> 07:11.126
I tried 30-odd years ago.

07:11.169 --> 07:13.781
- Please, come on in.
- Thank you.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.785
This, uh, wouldn't have
anything to do

07:17.828 --> 07:19.787
with your colleague
down the hall?

07:19.830 --> 07:21.876
Lisa Benner? Maybe.
A little.

07:21.919 --> 07:25.227
Thought it might.
Lisa and I go way back.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.447
Judge Benner is considering
a run for office,

07:27.490 --> 07:30.493
and she asked meTo look into
her deep, dark past?

07:30.537 --> 07:33.627
I was hoping you could talk
to me about the Cubrillon case.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.499
Careful what you wish for.

07:36.543 --> 07:39.154
How much time do you have?

07:41.286 --> 07:44.333
Captioned by
Los Angeles Distribution
and Broadcasting, Inc.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.294
They had no legal authority.

07:49.338 --> 07:50.513
That land has been
in my family

07:50.557 --> 07:52.036
since before California
was a state.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.690
Ephraim,
you have to listen.

07:53.734 --> 07:56.432
All I wanted was to keep on
in my family's way.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.957
My wife passed.
My daughter, sheshe left.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.525
I need to take you through
the process, what to expect

08:02.569 --> 08:05.267
This land, my traditions
they're all I have,

08:05.310 --> 08:08.009
and this so-called
governmentthey took it.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.837
Now they want to take
my liberty?

08:09.880 --> 08:12.056
This whole system is

08:12.100 --> 08:13.710
This whole system is why
you've been provided

08:13.754 --> 08:16.017
with a lawyer, me,
who you need to listen to.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.540
This is serious.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.499
They say that you fired
a gun at law enforcement.

08:19.542 --> 08:20.848
The D.A.'s office
will push for

08:20.891 --> 08:22.284
They have
no legal authority.

08:22.327 --> 08:24.242
Whether or not you believe
this system is illegal,

08:24.286 --> 08:26.549
you are facing
attempted murder charges.

08:26.593 --> 08:29.117
I was only trying
to scare 'em off.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.816
I just wanted to be
left alone.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.818
I fight the system
every day.

08:34.861 --> 08:37.125
You wanna walk out of here,
let me do my job.

08:37.168 --> 08:41.433
ButI am on your side, Ephraim.
Don't forget that.

08:45.046 --> 08:46.613
We're ready to head to...

08:46.656 --> 08:47.831
court.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.795
Some cases
really stick with you.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.579
For me,
that was Cubrillon.

08:56.623 --> 09:00.496
What made it so...
memorable?

09:00.540 --> 09:04.631
They bullied my sick clients
into low-dollar settlements.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.067
Tough to swallow,
but unfortunately,

09:06.110 --> 09:07.590
not all that rare.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.592
The cover-up,
on the other hand

09:09.636 --> 09:10.724
Cover-up?

09:10.767 --> 09:12.464
Six months
after we settled,

09:12.508 --> 09:14.684
Cubrillon had to
shut up shop

09:14.728 --> 09:17.774
when an anonymous source
leaked internal docs.

09:17.818 --> 09:21.038
Proof that Cubrillon knew
it was poisoning its workers

09:21.082 --> 09:22.387
and did nothing
to stop it.

09:22.431 --> 09:24.476
Those documents never
showed up in discovery?

09:24.520 --> 09:25.652
No, we tried.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.305
We could never find
definitive proof

09:27.349 --> 09:30.134
that Slefinger & Feste
helped hide the docs.

09:30.178 --> 09:33.181
But a firm of that caliber?
They knew.

09:33.224 --> 09:34.486
Including?

09:34.530 --> 09:36.314
Lisa Benner was
third-year associate.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.490
She would have gone over
every scrap of paper

09:38.534 --> 09:41.493
in that case.But she wasn't calling
the shots.

09:41.537 --> 09:44.148
Lisa Benner has never
been passively involved

09:44.192 --> 09:46.281
in anything,
not even then.

09:46.324 --> 09:47.674
What makes you so sure?

09:49.371 --> 09:51.852
We were...together

09:51.895 --> 09:53.810
for most of law school.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.639
Oh? Oh.Okay.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.641
Shared a studio apartment,

09:58.685 --> 10:00.251
took her home
to meet my parents.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.557
Whole nine yards.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.951
When the Cubrillon case
came along

10:03.994 --> 10:08.172
a few years
after we broke up, I was...

10:08.216 --> 10:11.654
I was as surprised as anyone
to see her true colors.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.571
Sorry to interrupt, Your Honor.
Time for court.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.834
Jean, I am so sorry.

10:17.878 --> 10:20.489
Thank you so much
for stopping by.

10:20.532 --> 10:23.535
I will be happy toI'm fine.
I'll show myself out.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.720
Selene Saint Clair.
That's your name, right?

10:33.763 --> 10:34.851
Yes.

10:34.895 --> 10:36.548
Has it always been?
Wasn't it...

10:36.592 --> 10:39.508
originally Agnes Krudski?

10:39.551 --> 10:41.292
- Yes.
- You changed it

10:41.336 --> 10:42.859
to sound more mystical,
didn't you?

10:42.903 --> 10:46.471
I changed it because one of
my spirit guides told me to.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.431
Your spirit guides.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.694
Did your spirit guides
also warn you

10:51.738 --> 10:54.218
that some of your clients
would report you

10:54.262 --> 10:55.742
for extortion and fraud?

10:57.000 --> 11:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:10.539 --> 11:13.107
Your Honor,
I've seen this before.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.978
Her spirit guides
are speaking to her.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.632
Your Honor,
are you gonna permit...

11:16.676 --> 11:18.503
whatever this is?

11:18.547 --> 11:20.505
Why not? Maybe she'll give us
the winning Lotto numbers.

11:20.549 --> 11:23.204
Huh.
The guides have spoken.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.858
Their predictions
are threefold.

11:24.901 --> 11:27.077
First, a wave of darkness
will soon be upon us.

11:27.121 --> 11:31.125
Second, a grave calamity
will descend

11:31.168 --> 11:32.866
upon this building.

11:32.909 --> 11:35.825
And third and finally,
something terrible

11:35.869 --> 11:39.394
will befall
someone youcare for.

11:39.437 --> 11:42.658
Ma'am, did you just
threaten the prosecut

11:42.702 --> 11:43.877
Your Honor, this is

11:45.574 --> 11:49.839
Hey, hey. A wave of darkness,
just as she predicted.

11:49.883 --> 11:51.928
Your Honor, it's well-known
that the faulty wiring in here

11:51.972 --> 11:53.669
causes the lights
to flicker.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.889
Anytime someone uses
the espresso machine

11:55.932 --> 11:59.370
in your chamb
- So noted. Please continue.

12:01.938 --> 12:04.767
Let's go.Em. Emily.

12:04.811 --> 12:07.117
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

12:07.161 --> 12:09.641
Ben? Remember Ben?

12:09.685 --> 12:11.687
He's Benner's son.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.950
His name is Ben Benner?

12:13.994 --> 12:15.909
Not the takeaway here.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.911
I mean, is it, like, a conflict
of interest with something?

12:17.954 --> 12:19.216
I mean,
she's the supervising judge.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.001
He wants to go out again.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.698
Ahem.

12:24.352 --> 12:26.571
All rise.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.054
Ephraim, stand up.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.145
Sir?

12:35.189 --> 12:36.277
Stand up.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.496
It is customary to stand

12:38.540 --> 12:40.324
to show respect for the court.

12:40.368 --> 12:43.153
No disrespect, but I am
an independent citizen.

12:43.197 --> 12:46.678
I will not submit
to this illegal tribunal.

12:46.722 --> 12:49.290
Everyone,
please take a seat.

12:49.333 --> 12:52.684
Mr. Bowles, we have procedures
in place here

12:52.728 --> 12:55.078
procedures to ensure
that you receive a fair trial.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.907
Without cause, they came
and took my land.

12:57.951 --> 13:00.518
Ephraim
An unprovoked act
of aggression.

13:00.562 --> 13:03.043
Yet I'm the one on trial?
Does that sound fair?

13:03.086 --> 13:05.219
Mr. Bowles, you will have
ample opportunity

13:05.262 --> 13:06.698
to speak your truth.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.744
On that, I give you my word.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.094
I understand that you disagree
very strongly

13:11.138 --> 13:12.530
with what has happened,

13:12.574 --> 13:14.271
but I'm
about to let in that jury

13:14.315 --> 13:17.100
12 fellow citizens
who will decide your fate.

13:17.144 --> 13:19.842
If you want them
to take you seriously,

13:19.886 --> 13:22.410
it would be wise to wait
your turn to speak.

13:22.453 --> 13:23.672
Do you understand?

13:25.630 --> 13:28.024
My client believes
in her gifts,

13:28.068 --> 13:30.461
and so did the people
who chose to pay her

13:30.505 --> 13:32.681
for services
that she provided.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.465
That's no crime.
That's a transaction.

13:34.509 --> 13:37.991
Mr. Nathan Malone paid Selene
to cleanse his karma

13:38.034 --> 13:41.037
and then turned on her
like a thankless viper

13:41.081 --> 13:43.910
when his ex-wife didn't
magically take him back.

13:43.953 --> 13:47.870
My client is a psychic,
not a miracle worker.

13:47.914 --> 13:51.004
A karmic cleanse does not
a better husband make.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.180
- Objection!
- What grounds?

13:53.223 --> 13:55.312
- He's badgering
- Your Honor, these attacks

13:55.356 --> 13:56.748
go far beyond what's supported
by the record.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.838
Overruled, Mr. Callan.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.709
I'm gonna call a brief recess.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.058
The rest of us
can stretch our legs

14:02.102 --> 14:04.191
while you give your clerk
a refresher

14:04.234 --> 14:05.409
on speaking objections

14:05.453 --> 14:07.281
when and by whom
they should be made.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.066
I'm sorry.

14:10.110 --> 14:13.461
Not in front
of opposing counsel.

14:20.642 --> 14:23.036
Uh...ahem.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.777
Sorry.
I gotta call you back.

14:25.821 --> 14:27.736
Hello, Jean.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.390
Lisa.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.914
I was visiting with
Judge Carmichael down the hall.

14:31.958 --> 14:35.483
She wanted to chat
about Cubrillon Industries.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.615
I asked her to do
a little research.

14:37.659 --> 14:41.315
Lisa, whatever your latest
machinations are, I'll pass.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.231
I just wanted
to give you a heads up

14:44.274 --> 14:46.320
so you wouldn't
get blindsided.

14:46.363 --> 14:47.974
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.714
Of course.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.153
You still drink tea?

14:53.196 --> 14:56.939
Would you like a cup
before you go?

14:58.549 --> 15:00.812
 And what did you observe
when you arrived at the scene?

15:00.856 --> 15:02.118
Tire tracks indicated

15:02.162 --> 15:04.599
the patrol car
had been parked here.

15:04.642 --> 15:05.992
Over by these trees,
opposite side

15:06.035 --> 15:08.255
of the tire tracks
from the porch,

15:08.298 --> 15:09.517
I found bullets
embedded in the bark

15:09.560 --> 15:11.301
- He's lying!
- You cannot do that.

15:11.345 --> 15:12.824
- But
- Ephraim, please.

15:12.868 --> 15:15.392
Pure fabrication!
You're trying to lock me away

15:15.436 --> 15:16.828
based on his lies!

15:16.872 --> 15:18.439
Mr. Bowles, if you don't

15:18.482 --> 15:20.223
He doesn't know
what he's talking about!

15:20.267 --> 15:23.270
Ephraim, stop it.You're all
just gonna let him

15:23.313 --> 15:24.836
I'm here fighting
for my freedom,

15:24.880 --> 15:26.969
and you won't even let me
speak my piece!

15:27.013 --> 15:28.928
Until the defendant can
regain his composure,

15:28.971 --> 15:31.278
this court is in recess.

15:31.321 --> 15:32.844
Oh, this whole...

15:35.282 --> 15:38.154
You had no intention of
ever letting me outta here.

15:38.198 --> 15:39.242
Oh!

15:41.070 --> 15:43.812
- Everybody!
- Your HonorNo.

15:43.855 --> 15:45.770
- Over there!

15:47.729 --> 15:49.731
Move it!

15:56.346 --> 15:57.652
Move it.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.227
Apple 1, give me
cover on doors.

16:07.270 --> 16:08.750
- On it.
- Apple 2...

16:08.793 --> 16:10.230
Situation update?

16:10.273 --> 16:13.363
Single suspect, white male,
believed to be acting alone

16:13.407 --> 16:15.409
without premeditation,
overpowered a bailiff

16:15.452 --> 16:17.063
and took
his service weapon.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.586
How many in there?
Did anyone get out?

16:18.629 --> 16:20.240
Count was 23.
The J.A. and court reporter

16:20.283 --> 16:22.416
managed to slip out
just as it went down.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.287
Take me to 'em.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.724
It was way out of line.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.117
I have to appear in front
of Laski regularly.

16:28.161 --> 16:30.990
Rizzo got under my skin
coming after our victims.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.079
The time to rebut
a shameless defense argument

16:33.122 --> 16:35.168
is in our rebuttal,
not before.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.039
I know, I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

16:38.519 --> 16:39.999
Oh, you guys are still here.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.305
Something wrong,
Your Honor?

16:42.349 --> 16:44.220
Courthouse security's making
the rounds. Lockdown protocol.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.092
Lockdown? What happened?

16:46.135 --> 16:47.571
The arraignment court probably
misplaced another defendant.

16:47.615 --> 16:50.487
Last time it happened,
we were stuck for hours.

16:50.531 --> 16:53.273
If I stayed in chambers, my J.A.
would make me do actual work,

16:53.316 --> 16:56.319
so I am hiding from her in here.
Now if you would...

17:05.633 --> 17:08.375
In there. Shelter in place.
Make yourself nice and cozy.

17:08.417 --> 17:10.898
Okay, let's get those
signal blockers up pronto.

17:10.942 --> 17:14.076
No communications in or out,
okay? Come on, come on, come on.

17:14.119 --> 17:16.948
Lieutenant Logan Hunt.
Special Enforcement Bureau.

17:16.992 --> 17:19.429
This is my operation.Sherri Kansky,

17:19.473 --> 17:21.648
Judicial Assistant
to Judge Carmichael.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.128
This is my turf.

17:23.172 --> 17:25.174
Well, then you're
who I need to talk to.

17:25.218 --> 17:26.915
I need access
to this guy's arrest record

17:26.958 --> 17:28.917
and anything else
you have.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.809
Hey, keep still over there.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.161
Hey, there, Mr. Bowles. My name is Logan.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.814
Any chance you have time
for a chat?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.557
You police?

18:00.601 --> 18:02.298
Had enough of police.

18:02.342 --> 18:03.604
I'm just a guy who's here

18:03.647 --> 18:05.345
to help you fix this
before anybody gets hurt.

18:05.388 --> 18:08.261
How about we start with
what it is you want out of this?

18:08.304 --> 18:12.874
I want a helicopter on the roof
andandandand cash.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.528
Ephraim, can I call you back?

18:14.571 --> 18:16.138
I want to help,
but this building

18:16.182 --> 18:17.705
was built in 1925.

18:17.748 --> 18:20.447
No helipad. Now I see
you've got a ranch here.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.057
Is that where you're
trying to get to?

18:22.101 --> 18:24.799
I'm not playing games, and I'm
not going back in that cage.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.148
You bring me a solution,

18:26.192 --> 18:28.411
or we have nothing
to talk about.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.459
Let's go. We need his file...

18:41.729 --> 18:43.252
Is he rational?

18:43.296 --> 18:44.514
He has some wild views.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.299
He's spent his whole life
off the grid

18:46.342 --> 18:49.954
and thinks, because he never
participated in society,

18:49.998 --> 18:51.173
he's free
of legal jurisdiction.

18:51.217 --> 18:54.133
That said,
he responds to logic.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.268
Mr. Bowles, if I may?

18:59.312 --> 19:02.489
You're not in charge anymore.
I am.

19:02.532 --> 19:03.664
I know that,

19:03.707 --> 19:05.579
but by holding
these people here,

19:05.622 --> 19:07.320
you are doing to them

19:07.363 --> 19:09.626
what the government
was doing to you.

19:09.670 --> 19:10.975
Oh, yeah? How you figure?

19:11.019 --> 19:13.587
These people have done
nothing to you,

19:13.630 --> 19:15.676
and you are holding them
here against their will.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.460
I'm not giving up
my leverage.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.810
A judge, two lawyers,
and two cops?

19:19.854 --> 19:21.943
That's more
than enough leverage.

19:21.986 --> 19:23.379
If I let them go...

19:23.423 --> 19:26.208
Then the police will see
that you're reasonable.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.297
They'll be more willing
to give you what you want.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.821
You're a man of principles
and convictions.

19:30.865 --> 19:32.258
I can see that.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.434
You know this is
the right thing to do.

19:43.660 --> 19:44.966
I'm sending some people out.

19:45.009 --> 19:48.230
Anybody tries anything,
I start shooting.

19:48.274 --> 19:51.190
I am the supervising judge.
I need to know what is happening

19:51.233 --> 19:52.843
in my courthouse.I'm sorry.
These are my orders.

19:59.241 --> 20:02.897
You know, I'm trying
very hard to convince myself

20:02.940 --> 20:05.073
I'm not terrified.

20:05.116 --> 20:08.337
You wearing out the carpet
isn't helping.

20:08.381 --> 20:10.513
I could use a distraction.
Why don't we catch up?

20:12.080 --> 20:13.386
Over the last three decades?

20:13.429 --> 20:14.604
Mm-hmm.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.911
Oh, let's see.

20:16.954 --> 20:20.784
Got married, had a son,
became a judge.

20:20.828 --> 20:23.570
Buried my husband.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.093
Watched my son
become a lawyer.

20:25.136 --> 20:26.399
So not much, then?

20:28.749 --> 20:31.317
You'd like my son Ben.
He's an idealist.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.537
Although he was a handful
the first two decades.

20:34.581 --> 20:37.279
Don't have to tell me
what that's like.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.716
Had two of my own.
I know.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.632
I changed my mind.
Now they're off at college,

20:42.676 --> 20:45.244
and my ex-wife runs a spa
in Sedona.

20:45.287 --> 20:48.943
It's just me and a geriatric
black Lab named Springsteen.

20:48.986 --> 20:51.250
We talked about that name
for our dog.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.294
Which we never got.

20:56.516 --> 20:59.040
It's a good dog name,
so...

21:01.347 --> 21:04.306
That's weird.
There's no signal.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.786
Where's Lopez today?

21:05.829 --> 21:07.266
Trial. 802.
That's lucky.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.877
Whatever's going on, I bet
Lola has her house in order.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.314
You try Amy?Mediation in West Covina.

21:12.358 --> 21:15.012
West Covina?

21:15.056 --> 21:16.579
Lockdown doesn't sound so bad.

21:19.234 --> 21:23.673
Your, uh...
your little flare-up earlier

21:23.717 --> 21:25.153
have anything to do
with that book you're reading?

21:25.196 --> 21:27.198
Well, no, it's nothing.

21:27.242 --> 21:29.288
Bro, we road tripped
to Vegas.

21:29.331 --> 21:32.203
That's a sacred bond.
Talk to me.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.988
What's got you
losing your cool in court

21:34.031 --> 21:35.772
and reading
save-your-relationship books?

21:35.816 --> 21:39.080
It's complicated. It's a lot
to deal with for both of us.

21:39.123 --> 21:42.866
I'm trying to respect
the situation, but...

21:42.910 --> 21:44.128
it just feels like
she's pulling away,

21:44.172 --> 21:46.043
then she's not, then she is.
It's just

21:46.087 --> 21:47.393
It's good, but...

21:47.436 --> 21:49.090
Her ex wasn't
exactly a prince.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.352
I know she's been
through a lot.

21:50.396 --> 21:54.225
It's just...I'm not sure
we got our timing right.

21:54.269 --> 21:58.621
I'm not sure...if I'm
what she needs right now.

21:58.665 --> 22:00.841
Let her go. Cut your losses.

22:00.884 --> 22:03.365
I have the hearing
of a vampire bat.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.236
If you can feel her
pulling away,

22:05.280 --> 22:06.716
she's already
made her decision.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.631
Due respect, Your Honor,
but who made you an expert?

22:08.675 --> 22:09.980
Dr. Bev.

22:10.024 --> 22:12.374
My wife and I have been
seeing her for years.

22:12.418 --> 22:15.072
Rhonda is also a lawyer,
so we refer disputes

22:15.116 --> 22:17.248
to a neutral third party.
Keeps the peace.

22:17.292 --> 22:18.554
Hmm.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.122
Yo.

22:21.165 --> 22:22.689
Hey,
what's with the tac gear?

22:22.732 --> 22:25.518
Just doing a security sweep.
Only the three of you in here?

22:25.561 --> 22:26.997
Deputy Luke Watkins.
Courthouse Security.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.477
Can you give me an update
on the lockdown?

22:28.521 --> 22:30.914
They're releasing
some of the hostages.Hostages?

22:30.958 --> 22:32.307
Suspect still has
some people in 802

22:32.351 --> 22:34.135
judge, lawyers, some others.

22:38.269 --> 22:39.314
Go, go, go, go.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.359
Go, go, wait.

22:44.624 --> 22:46.277
- All the way down.
- Over to the right.

22:46.321 --> 22:47.583
All the way down.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.629
Okay, Ephraim,
let's keep talking.

22:49.672 --> 22:52.196
I did what you asked.
Now go sit down.

22:53.328 --> 22:56.462
Sit down! Stop trying
to get in my head!

22:57.985 --> 22:59.421
Oh, my

23:01.423 --> 23:03.294
Aah!

23:06.689 --> 23:08.561
Come get him.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.171
All right,
we just need more time.

23:10.214 --> 23:11.955
What about the daughter?
- Alice Bowles.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.304
Central Patrol's
bringing her over.

23:13.348 --> 23:14.480
Estranged, apparently,
so good luck with that.

23:14.523 --> 23:15.611
Alice still might have
useful intel,

23:15.655 --> 23:17.308
help us figure him out.

23:17.352 --> 23:19.659
There are five innocent people
still trapped in that courtroom

23:19.702 --> 23:22.444
with a suspect who is becoming
increasingly violent

23:22.488 --> 23:24.011
and who now has two guns.

23:24.054 --> 23:27.275
The detective just received
a serious blow to the head,

23:27.318 --> 23:28.885
and all youHow do you know?
Are you watching?

23:28.929 --> 23:30.844
Disable the feed.
Yes, sir.

23:30.887 --> 23:33.237
- All right, folks.
- Sherri...

23:33.281 --> 23:35.370
No.Let's prepare
for a tactical response.

23:52.213 --> 23:54.084
A few weeks ago, I'd be
in there with a badge

23:54.128 --> 23:55.869
and a gun.

23:55.912 --> 23:58.480
Lopez is tough.
Lola, too.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.830
Choi, the rest of them.

24:00.874 --> 24:02.745
They'll...be okay.

24:02.789 --> 24:04.268
You don't know that.

24:04.312 --> 24:05.487
Wonder if this is
what our psychic meant

24:05.531 --> 24:07.533
by grave calamity.

24:07.576 --> 24:10.579
That "calamity" bit is part
of her greatest hits.

24:10.623 --> 24:12.189
- Meaning?
- That prediction

24:12.233 --> 24:14.104
is all over the transcripts
of the calls you had me review.

24:14.148 --> 24:15.932
Jones, Garcia, Li

24:15.976 --> 24:18.761
all the ones we submitted
into evidence.Every one of them?

24:18.805 --> 24:19.980
Said it the same way

24:20.023 --> 24:21.242
"Grave calamity."

24:21.285 --> 24:22.548
Really?

24:22.591 --> 24:24.811
Okay, so we tell the jury

24:24.854 --> 24:27.117
that she's using
the same tricks on them

24:27.161 --> 24:28.554
that she used
on her victims, and

24:28.597 --> 24:30.904
They'll convict for sure.

24:30.947 --> 24:32.862
It's a slam dunk.

24:32.906 --> 24:34.342
You just gave us
our rebuttal.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.344
I canhear you.
Gentlemen...

24:36.387 --> 24:37.954
we're verging on ex parte.

24:48.661 --> 24:52.229
What if I just walk out of here
with you?

24:52.273 --> 24:53.579
They'll shoot you.

24:53.622 --> 24:55.015
If I've got my gun
to your head,

24:55.058 --> 24:57.539
anything happens to me,
I can still get a shot off.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.323
They won't risk it.
Get up.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.195
No. No, no, no!

25:01.238 --> 25:02.283
- Hey!

25:04.285 --> 25:06.809
The only thing that'll get you
is killed! Her, too!

25:06.853 --> 25:09.290
- Stop talking!
- Either you'll make a mistake,

25:09.333 --> 25:11.553
or they will.They will take
a calculated risk,

25:11.597 --> 25:13.337
soon as they think
they've got a shot.

25:13.381 --> 25:15.296
You don't want that.

25:15.339 --> 25:17.864
None of this
would have happened...

25:17.907 --> 25:19.474
if it weren't for you.

25:21.041 --> 25:24.087
Ms. Bowles, your father has
no priors before this arrest.

25:24.131 --> 25:27.003
Has he ever showedI've never seen him act
like this.

25:27.047 --> 25:29.571
It's been three years
since...

25:29.615 --> 25:31.312
I don't recognize
the man in that room.

25:31.355 --> 25:32.835
Do you think
you might be able to...

25:32.879 --> 25:35.098
He won't listen to me.
No, the last time we talked,

25:35.142 --> 25:38.624
he acted so...betrayed.

25:38.667 --> 25:41.365
I'm the last person
he would want

25:41.409 --> 25:42.541
Lieutenant.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.325
Excuse me.

25:44.368 --> 25:45.674
Things are escalating.

25:45.718 --> 25:47.458
We need to finalize
the assault plans.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.417
Okay, tossing a volatile
relationship in the situation

25:49.460 --> 25:50.766
is only gonna set him off.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.202
- Okay.
- Clock's ticking.

25:52.246 --> 25:53.508
All right, do what you gotta do.
Ma'am, please,

25:53.552 --> 25:54.901
if you wait in here...

25:54.944 --> 25:56.598
Our clock.
You get it right now.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.034
- Yes, sir.
- Make sure it's ready.

25:59.296 --> 26:03.213
I never did nothing to no one
my whole life,

26:03.257 --> 26:07.740
then you people show up
and take away everything

26:07.783 --> 26:10.569
my family ever worked for!
- Ephraim, Ephraim.

26:11.831 --> 26:14.094
If you wanna talk
about family,

26:14.137 --> 26:15.835
Thomas has a family.

26:15.878 --> 26:19.316
Tell him about your boys.

26:19.360 --> 26:23.407
Hayeshe is 10.
Little League pitcher.

26:23.451 --> 26:25.584
Practices in the yard
every morning.

26:25.627 --> 26:28.630
And, uh, Tobyclass clown.

26:28.674 --> 26:31.677
Tried to tell me a joke
this morning, but, uh,

26:31.720 --> 26:36.203
I rushed out before...
before the punchline.

26:36.246 --> 26:38.509
Really wish I hadn't.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.294
 I hate the system.
I really do.

26:40.337 --> 26:42.470
I fight against it
tooth and nail

26:42.513 --> 26:44.472
every single day.

26:44.515 --> 26:46.561
But he is not the system.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.912
He is a human being.
He is a father just like you.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.610
And why should I care
about hisfamily?

26:51.653 --> 26:54.525
Your daughter what would she
what would she

26:54.569 --> 26:56.136
She left.

26:56.179 --> 26:58.704
She rejected everything
I ever stood for.

26:58.747 --> 27:01.271
Went to college,
took a job with the state.

27:01.315 --> 27:02.664
She doesn't care.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.274
I don't think that's true.

27:04.318 --> 27:09.279
I have gone months
without talking to my parents.

27:09.323 --> 27:11.891
I have been mad at them,
but I never stopped caring.

27:11.934 --> 27:14.328
What's her name?
Your daughter.

27:15.851 --> 27:16.983
Alice.

27:17.026 --> 27:18.637
How do you think
Alice will feel?

27:18.680 --> 27:20.682
She

27:20.726 --> 27:24.555
When she turns on the news,
will you be proud

27:24.599 --> 27:27.167
for her to see that you killed
an unarmed man?

27:47.100 --> 27:49.015
I appreciate that, Captain.
Still, I

27:50.538 --> 27:53.149
Ahem. Call back
at your earliest convenience.

28:01.418 --> 28:02.593
What?

28:02.637 --> 28:05.422
It's just...
it's odd, seeing you,

28:05.466 --> 28:08.425
when I've had this
thisthis image of you

28:08.469 --> 28:11.167
in my head for years.
- Which was?

28:11.211 --> 28:12.734
Corporate shark
in a Chanel suit,

28:12.778 --> 28:13.953
handing a pen
to my clients,

28:13.996 --> 28:15.868
asking them to sign
their futures away.

28:15.911 --> 28:17.086
I liked that suit.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.307
I wasn't that person.

28:20.350 --> 28:21.874
You must like
Judge Carmichael.

28:21.917 --> 28:24.354
Wouldn't trust just anyone
with your opposition research.

28:24.398 --> 28:27.749
She always knows
what's right.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.620
You wanted her
to bust you for Cubrillon?

28:29.664 --> 28:32.101
I wanted to know
how she'd feel about it

28:32.145 --> 28:33.929
if she found out,

28:33.973 --> 28:36.932
to see...how a big
of a political liability

28:36.976 --> 28:38.542
it would be,

28:38.586 --> 28:40.675
and if someone with
a moral compass like hers

28:40.719 --> 28:43.591
could excuse it, then maybe
I could forgive myself.

28:43.634 --> 28:44.897
Not how that works.

28:44.940 --> 28:47.421
What you did to those people
- Come on, Jean.

28:47.464 --> 28:49.553
I saw how you worked
my clients.

28:49.597 --> 28:50.816
I know what that
firm was doing

28:50.859 --> 28:51.991
You didn't see everything.

28:52.034 --> 28:56.560
Sure. Fine. You're right.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.911
I don't need to hear
your excuses anyway.

28:58.954 --> 29:01.696
I'm ready to actually
tell you what happened

29:01.740 --> 29:04.743
if you're willing
to listen.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.309
Go ahead.

29:15.362 --> 29:17.277
I leaked the documents.

29:20.497 --> 29:21.716
And I made it look

29:21.760 --> 29:23.587
like it came
from inside the company.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.940
If anybody finds out,
it's over.

29:27.983 --> 29:31.204
I'll be disbarred,
everything I've worked for.

29:52.051 --> 29:53.487
No news is good news.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.184
Until it isn't.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.798
I don't even know
what to say,

29:59.841 --> 30:03.236
except that I'm trying
not to freak out myself,

30:03.279 --> 30:06.326
but about
that other thing

30:06.369 --> 30:08.850
some advice to take
your mind off the crisis?

30:08.894 --> 30:10.243
Why not?

30:10.286 --> 30:11.418
Give her space.

30:11.461 --> 30:13.986
My last girlfriend?

30:14.029 --> 30:16.205
Said I didn't do enough.

30:16.249 --> 30:17.990
Said she didn't know
how I felt about her.

30:18.033 --> 30:20.644
Don't
Do not overcorrect.

30:20.688 --> 30:23.778
How about
a little quiet time?

30:23.822 --> 30:25.171
Your Honor, are you seriously
not concerned

30:25.214 --> 30:26.825
about what's happening
in Courtroom 802?

30:26.868 --> 30:28.783
Trying not to be.
Would you like to know why?

30:28.827 --> 30:30.002
Sure.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.004
Because I can't tell the future.
No one can.

30:32.047 --> 30:33.570
Isn't that what you've been
trying to prove in this case?

30:33.614 --> 30:36.138
No one has a crystal ball.
Might as well be an optimist.

30:36.182 --> 30:37.879
Assume the best.
Live your life.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.663
Same applies
to your relationship.

30:39.707 --> 30:41.883
Don't create
a self-fulfilling prophecy.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.624
Just listen to her.

30:55.984 --> 30:57.072
Thank you

30:57.116 --> 30:59.727
for, um...

30:59.770 --> 31:01.555
saving my life.

31:01.598 --> 31:03.557
What can I say?

31:03.600 --> 31:05.907
Lost causes
are my specialty.

31:13.567 --> 31:14.873
Please.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.885
I know what I'm gonna do.

31:30.236 --> 31:31.541
You don't want to do that.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.282
Find my daughter.

31:33.326 --> 31:34.849
Tell her that I loved her.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.111
Ephraim, no.

31:36.155 --> 31:37.678
If you do what I think
you're about to do,

31:37.721 --> 31:38.853
what's the point?

31:38.897 --> 31:40.986
Unhinged gunman
killed by officers.

31:41.029 --> 31:43.205
Is that what you want
your legacy to be?

31:43.249 --> 31:44.903
Why should I care?

31:44.946 --> 31:49.037
You came here to my courtroom
with a point to make,

31:49.081 --> 31:52.258
and I gave you my word
that we would listen to you.

31:52.301 --> 31:55.130
Don't you still
want that, Ephraim

31:55.174 --> 31:57.089
to be heard?

31:57.132 --> 32:00.440
'Cause if so,
now is the time.

32:10.841 --> 32:13.192
If they go in there...

32:19.241 --> 32:22.462
Alice?
Did I hear that right?

32:22.505 --> 32:25.334
Alice? You need to talk
to him.

32:25.378 --> 32:27.293
I'm sorry. Who are you?

32:27.336 --> 32:29.425
Someone who cares a lot

32:29.469 --> 32:31.775
about the people
in that courtroom.

32:34.256 --> 32:35.562
Something changed.

32:35.605 --> 32:38.217
When I left, he thought
I was abandoning him,

32:38.260 --> 32:41.960
and I tried to explain,
but he got so mad,

32:42.003 --> 32:46.355
and I...I threw it
right back at him.

32:46.399 --> 32:48.009
After what I said,

32:48.053 --> 32:49.793
there's no way
he'll listen to me.

32:49.837 --> 32:53.667
Maybe not, but you might
not get another chance.

32:53.710 --> 32:56.844
This morning, my boss

32:56.887 --> 33:01.109
I snapped at her
for being indecisive,

33:01.153 --> 33:05.766
and my...my boyfriend
brought me breakfast,

33:05.809 --> 33:08.334
just to be nice.

33:08.377 --> 33:11.728
And I was such an ass.

33:11.772 --> 33:13.687
Um...

33:15.080 --> 33:18.648
If I could talk
to them now...

33:18.692 --> 33:20.694
but I can't

33:20.737 --> 33:23.871
because they're both
in there.

33:26.526 --> 33:29.224
If you have...

33:29.268 --> 33:33.054
anything that you want
to say to your father

33:33.098 --> 33:37.058
before anything drastic
happens,

33:37.102 --> 33:38.929
now is the time.

33:42.237 --> 33:44.239
All right, Mr. Bowles.

33:44.283 --> 33:46.633
The court is prepared
to hear your statement.

33:46.676 --> 33:48.374
What is it that you want?

33:48.417 --> 33:52.769
Freedom...from all this.
I want my life back.

33:52.813 --> 33:55.555
You cannot do this.
By storming the courtroom,

33:55.598 --> 33:57.339
you are endangering
those people.

33:57.383 --> 33:58.645
We don't know
what she's gonna say.

33:58.688 --> 33:59.994
We don't know
how he'll react.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.301
She can get through to him.
There is a chance.

34:02.344 --> 34:04.912
If things go wrong
and you had that opportunity

34:04.955 --> 34:06.653
Get the camera feed up,
but I want your people in place.

34:06.696 --> 34:09.090
The second there's even a hint
of this going sideways,

34:09.134 --> 34:10.960
we move in.

34:11.005 --> 34:12.963
Help me understand why.

34:13.007 --> 34:15.966
The house they took
I was born in it.

34:16.010 --> 34:17.402
My daughter
was born there, too.

34:17.446 --> 34:19.405
It sounds like
a very special place.

34:19.447 --> 34:21.233
It was my world.

34:21.275 --> 34:24.105
Everything I learned
I learned there

34:24.149 --> 34:26.368
how to survive,
how to be free

34:26.411 --> 34:28.891
Free from what?Free from your world.

34:28.936 --> 34:31.112
All the terrible things
that go on out there

34:31.156 --> 34:34.855
wars, drugs,
violent crime,

34:34.898 --> 34:36.422
terrorism.
Do you blame me?

34:36.465 --> 34:37.726
You don't have to tell me

34:37.771 --> 34:41.556
about the ugly parts
of this country.

34:41.601 --> 34:44.516
But you take the good
with the bad.

34:44.560 --> 34:47.346
Church picnics
and ball games

34:47.389 --> 34:50.827
and fish frysOh, those things
are they worth

34:50.871 --> 34:53.525
surrendering your free will
to government oppression?

34:53.569 --> 34:55.918
Society in every state,
is a blessing,

34:55.963 --> 34:59.184
but government,
even at its best,

34:59.227 --> 35:00.620
is a necessary evil.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.578
Thomas Paine,
"Common Sense."

35:02.622 --> 35:04.319
Pretty words.
What's your point?

35:04.363 --> 35:06.452
If you choose
to only see the bad,

35:06.495 --> 35:10.151
to toss out
human connection

35:10.195 --> 35:12.197
in the name
of protecting your liberty,

35:12.240 --> 35:15.200
then you see freedom.
I see isolation.

35:15.243 --> 35:17.506
I see a prison
of your own making,

35:17.550 --> 35:20.727
and that sounds
pretty lonely to me, Ephraim.

35:20.770 --> 35:22.337
It didn't used to be.

35:22.381 --> 35:23.382
Ephraim...

35:25.384 --> 35:26.472
Ephraim.

35:26.515 --> 35:28.082
I'm done.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.174
Ephraim, answer it. Please.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.436
Pick it up.

35:36.699 --> 35:38.571
They want us
to turn on the monitors.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.660
Told you, I'm done.

35:40.703 --> 35:44.054
Dad? Can you see me?

35:44.098 --> 35:45.404
It's me.

35:45.447 --> 35:49.190
Alice? Baby?

35:49.234 --> 35:50.322
Why did you bring her here?

35:50.365 --> 35:52.106
Dad, please stop this.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.586
Why are you doing this?

35:53.629 --> 35:56.371
They took everything I had.
They took our home,

35:56.415 --> 35:59.983
my land.
- The land? Is that really...

36:00.027 --> 36:01.985
Dad,
II love that place, too.

36:02.029 --> 36:04.031
I can talk to people,
see what we can do

36:04.074 --> 36:07.426
to get it back, but, I mean,
is that all that really

36:07.469 --> 36:09.079
matters to you?

36:09.123 --> 36:11.821
Without my land,
without my freedom...

36:11.865 --> 36:13.301
my life is gone.

36:13.345 --> 36:14.737
I'm not gone, Dad.

36:14.781 --> 36:16.086
Everything that I ever
worked for is

36:16.130 --> 36:18.872
Just because I left,
chose a different life,

36:18.915 --> 36:21.875
doesn't mean...

36:21.918 --> 36:25.879
I still need you.

36:25.922 --> 36:28.925
I love you, Dad, so much.

36:33.713 --> 36:37.717
Are you ready to end this,
Ephraim, peacefully?

36:49.990 --> 36:52.862
Here you go.

36:55.909 --> 36:57.432
Hands all the way up.

36:58.825 --> 37:00.261
Do it. Do it now.
- Move, move, move.

37:00.305 --> 37:01.741
Hands on your head.

37:03.699 --> 37:06.702
Interlace your fingers.
Get on your knees.

37:12.882 --> 37:15.581
Lockdown is over.
The situation has been handled.

37:15.624 --> 37:18.975
Is everyone, uhThere's a cop in there
with a nasty bump on his head,

37:19.019 --> 37:21.195
but no one else is harmed.

37:23.589 --> 37:25.460
All right.

37:25.504 --> 37:29.247
Ahem. Shall we resume
in say, 20 minutes?

37:34.252 --> 37:35.818
Get out of here.

37:35.862 --> 37:38.168
We both have people
we need to see.

37:59.059 --> 38:00.713
II love you.

38:05.848 --> 38:08.416
Lola.

38:08.460 --> 38:09.765
You scared
the hell out of me.

38:19.166 --> 38:21.473
Mm-mm. It has been a day.

38:21.516 --> 38:22.517
You're telling me.
I got locked down

38:22.561 --> 38:24.606
in a room with Judge Laski.

38:24.650 --> 38:28.436
Oof. Between that
and an armed hostage taker,

38:28.480 --> 38:30.482
how did you make out?

38:30.525 --> 38:32.614
It wasn't too bad.
Luke had my back.

38:32.658 --> 38:37.489
Mr. Watkins. We could have
used him in there today.

38:37.532 --> 38:39.404
How's he doing?Ah, he's great.

38:39.447 --> 38:41.188
Reminds me a little
of myself

38:41.231 --> 38:42.407
when I first joined
the D.A.'s office.

38:42.450 --> 38:45.975
Ooh! You were a pain.

38:46.019 --> 38:48.238
Yeah, you kept me
from hurting myself.

38:48.282 --> 38:50.632
- Oh.
- My time to pay it forward.

38:52.155 --> 38:55.333
Your Honor, the detective
is ready for your statement.

38:55.376 --> 38:56.943
Mm.
I'll catch up
with you later.

38:56.986 --> 38:58.727
No.

39:01.817 --> 39:04.516
Your Honor, I'm...

39:04.559 --> 39:08.084
uh, I'm so happy
you're okay.

39:08.128 --> 39:10.609
Thank you, Sherri.

39:30.324 --> 39:33.762
I'm so glad
that you're okay.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.421
I love you.

39:42.075 --> 39:44.120
I was not planning to.
If that was too

39:44.164 --> 39:45.383
It wasn't. I just...

39:49.212 --> 39:50.518
Oh, my God, Em, you're okay.

39:50.562 --> 39:51.824
That was awful.Yes.

39:54.043 --> 39:56.785
Luke, it's just hard
with everything going on.

39:56.829 --> 39:58.178
I'llI'll
We'll talk later, okay?

39:58.221 --> 40:00.920
- I was so worried.
- Okay?

40:06.621 --> 40:10.320
What's up?
Thought you'd be with, uh...

40:10.364 --> 40:12.975
Oh, we might need
to get a beer.

40:13.019 --> 40:15.413
We might.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.066
Just one, because I want
to give you first crack

40:17.110 --> 40:19.199
at writing our rebuttal
for tomorrow.

40:19.242 --> 40:22.420
But first, beer.

40:24.378 --> 40:25.553
Thanks.

40:25.597 --> 40:27.294
...all injured
from the courthouse.

40:29.514 --> 40:32.560
Great news.
I'm only mildly concussed.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.040
Cleared to leave.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.302
Oh, God.

40:38.087 --> 40:39.175
I'm sorry.

40:45.530 --> 40:46.618
Does this hurt?

40:46.661 --> 40:47.619
No.

40:47.662 --> 40:49.098
Good.

41:01.546 --> 41:02.938
In here?

41:02.982 --> 41:04.723
I don't remember
this part of the routine.

41:04.766 --> 41:07.943
Oh. Well, you're concussed.

41:07.987 --> 41:10.076
You know what that means?
You can't go to sleep.

41:10.119 --> 41:11.338
Well,

41:11.381 --> 41:15.821
I've got a list of ideas
for keeping you up.

41:23.785 --> 41:25.874
I still can't get over
how brave you were.

41:25.918 --> 41:27.876
Barely remember it.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.009
It's like
just pure adrenaline.

41:30.052 --> 41:32.359
Want to pick up takeout
on the way home?

41:32.402 --> 41:33.795
Oh, you're headed back
to the house?

41:33.839 --> 41:35.405
I figured you and Luke
would

41:35.449 --> 41:37.538
Trying to get rid of me?
More plans with Ben Benner?

41:37.582 --> 41:40.062
- You can just call him Ben.
- What's the fun of that?

41:40.106 --> 41:41.368
Speak of the devil.

41:41.411 --> 41:43.762
Oh, he iscute.

41:43.805 --> 41:45.415
Get after it.
Shut up.

41:45.459 --> 41:47.417
Hey, are you okay?

41:47.461 --> 41:49.115
Yeah. I am.

41:49.158 --> 41:51.509
I need to check in
on my mom, but, uh,

41:51.552 --> 41:54.642
maybe, uh...how about
that drink after...

41:54.686 --> 41:57.993
Oh, I'm gonna need
at least two drinks.

41:58.037 --> 41:59.255
All right.

41:59.299 --> 42:00.822
You've reached Robin Taylor.

42:00.866 --> 42:02.563
Please leave a message
at the tone.

42:02.607 --> 42:07.350
Hey, baby.
I was really hoping to...

42:07.394 --> 42:10.049
You wouldn't believe
the day I had.

42:10.092 --> 42:11.877
It was...

42:13.487 --> 42:15.402
It was really awful.

42:15.445 --> 42:21.887
Um...
but I'm okay. I'm safe.

42:21.930 --> 42:25.412
I just...

42:25.455 --> 42:30.460
And now I'm headed home
to ourhome,

42:30.504 --> 42:34.769
and you won't be there,
which is...

42:34.813 --> 42:40.470
Anyway, I'll talk to you soon.
I love you.

42:41.602 --> 42:43.343
