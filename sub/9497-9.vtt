00:27.334 --> 00:29.334
Okay, so you worked at, I'm sorry,
what is it?

00:29.417 --> 00:31.083
Black & Tan.

00:31.167 --> 00:32.334
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:32.417 --> 00:35.000
In the East Village.
Mostly NYU students.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.542
- And how was that, working there?

00:38.626 --> 00:40.167
- I hated it.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.042
Underage drinkers.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.292
Lots of puking,
passing out.

00:44.375 --> 00:45.459
- You didn't card the students?

00:45.542 --> 00:47.125
Well,
the owner told us not to.

00:47.209 --> 00:49.918
The place was packed every night.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.709
So, uh,
why'd you leave there?

00:53.792 --> 00:55.000
- I didn't leave.

00:55.083 --> 00:58.292
They got shut down after some girl died
in the place.

01:00.542 --> 01:02.501
Uh, okay, so where'd
you bartend before that?

01:02.584 --> 01:04.876
- In Catskill, the Horseshoe Bar.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.250
- That upstate?
- Yeah.

01:06.876 --> 01:10.042
It's the only place for miles
that isn't a gay bar,

01:10.125 --> 01:13.042
so pretty much every night,
it was jammed to the rafters.

01:14.042 --> 01:15.083
That was hard.

01:15.918 --> 01:17.125
I was there two years.

01:21.584 --> 01:24.042
Do you mind if I ask why you smile
like that?

01:25.751 --> 01:27.083
- Just trying to be easy.

01:28.083 --> 01:29.375
- Just trying to be easy?

01:30.000 --> 01:31.250
- Trying to be easy.

01:32.250 --> 01:34.000
- Okay.

01:34.083 --> 01:36.751
Okay, uh...
The Horseshoe Bar.

01:36.834 --> 01:37.959
Okay, before that?

01:38.042 --> 01:39.709
- Prison.
- Oh.

01:40.334 --> 01:41.459
Yikes, okay.

01:41.542 --> 01:43.667
Well, I'm not gonna
pretend that's...

01:45.000 --> 01:46.918
Um,
what were you in prison for?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
- Manslaughter.
- Okay, yikes.

01:49.083 --> 01:50.918
Wow.
That's...

01:51.000 --> 01:52.751
That's not my favorite thing
about you.

01:52.834 --> 01:55.083
- I was 16, I was on drugs.

01:55.167 --> 01:56.501
I did it.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.125
I served the time.

01:58.209 --> 01:59.334
I'm clean
and sober.

02:00.459 --> 02:02.000
Clean record
for 20 years.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.042
There you have it, ma'am.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.167
Make your choice.

02:06.250 --> 02:07.459
Either way,
I get it.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.334
I think maybe that smile is 'cause
you're nervous, maybe?

02:16.083 --> 02:17.125
- Yeah.

02:18.709 --> 02:20.834
I get nervous
for every job interview,

02:21.584 --> 02:24.083
'cause I know at some point
I have to drop that news.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.959
Takes me like 50 interviews
to get a job.

02:27.584 --> 02:29.501
It's what I live with.
It's my fault.

02:30.125 --> 02:33.918
But I would like to know,
you know, your inclination,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.209
so I can move on if I have to.

02:36.292 --> 02:38.792
Well, look, Jerold,
thank you for your honesty.

02:38.876 --> 02:41.459
But the truth is, we're interviewing
here now

02:41.542 --> 02:44.334
because of a little drama of our own,

02:44.417 --> 02:47.876
and I'm not sure I want to invite more
drama into the place, you know?

02:48.501 --> 02:50.334
- Okay, but I would argue that I'm...

02:50.417 --> 02:52.667
I'm sort of pre-drama'd.

02:52.751 --> 02:54.292
And I'm on lifelong parole.

02:56.125 --> 02:59.375
I mean, most human beings have
potential to bring trouble and trauma,

03:00.000 --> 03:04.334
but I'm a rare case
where I can't make another mistake.

03:05.125 --> 03:08.501
I literally have my own personal
law professional.

03:08.584 --> 03:11.584
Make sure that I'm cool
and I stay in between the lines.

03:12.209 --> 03:15.667
Most people you get in here, you don't
know what they might do.

03:17.876 --> 03:21.459
That...
doing anything for you?

03:21.542 --> 03:22.959
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Jerold.

03:23.042 --> 03:25.834
I can't...
You know, I can't get past it.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.250
But, um, I wish you luck.

03:28.334 --> 03:29.834
- It's okay.
- Okay.

03:30.083 --> 03:32.792
You want to leave your number,
in case I hear of something or?

03:32.876 --> 03:34.250
Yeah?
- Sure, yeah.

03:34.334 --> 03:35.792
- Here.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.083
- I don't even like it anymore.
- Yeah, well, it's work.

03:42.876 --> 03:44.375
- Yeah, but, like, I...

03:44.459 --> 03:47.083
I was so psyched
when I got hired.

03:47.167 --> 03:48.792
I always wanted to work there.

03:49.417 --> 03:52.042
I...
I screamed when I got the job, like...

03:52.125 --> 03:54.042
like it was "American Idol"
or something.

03:54.667 --> 03:55.918
- Yeah, but...

03:56.000 --> 03:57.042
It's work.

03:58.792 --> 04:00.042
- Why do you keep saying that?

04:00.667 --> 04:01.792
- Because it's work!

04:02.834 --> 04:04.250
My dad dreamed
of walking on the moon

04:04.334 --> 04:06.417
and then he walked on the moon
and he got sick of it.

04:06.501 --> 04:07.876
It's work.
- Yeah, but, like, I...

04:07.959 --> 04:11.667
I knew that I wanted to work there
since I was 18.

04:11.751 --> 04:15.626
I, uh, I was like,
I'm gonna get into an Ivy League school

04:15.709 --> 04:19.791
and I'm gonna write for the school paper
and build my portfolio.

04:19.875 --> 04:22.959
Then I'll intern at any magazine

04:23.042 --> 04:24.959
and then I'll get the first real job
that opens up there.

04:25.042 --> 04:27.334
And then I will take my resume
over to the New Yorker

04:27.417 --> 04:30.918
and get hired,
and I did every step.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.125
And, boom,
dream realized,

04:33.209 --> 04:37.334
and two years later, I am totally...
sick of it.

04:37.959 --> 04:39.876
Yeah, that's...
That's like my dad.

04:40.501 --> 04:42.709
He knew he wanted to go to the moon
since he was, like, five,

04:43.334 --> 04:44.876
and it was his total focus...

04:45.501 --> 04:50.334
So disappointing, because, like,
if this isn't satisfying, what is?

04:50.584 --> 04:53.834
I mean, why does
anybody want to do anything?

04:53.918 --> 04:56.459
What am I supposed to do,
you know?

04:56.542 --> 04:59.792
Try for my second-favorite thing
and hope that's better?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.125
- Yeah.

05:02.209 --> 05:03.250
That's what I'm saying.

05:03.876 --> 05:06.501
My dad said that getting
to the moon was, like,

05:06.584 --> 05:11.959
the most depressing thing that ever
happened to him, because now what?

05:12.334 --> 05:13.375
You know?

05:16.167 --> 05:18.167
Do you even know
what I'm saying, though?

05:18.792 --> 05:21.501
Like, achieving your goals,
and you achieve them,

05:22.459 --> 05:26.459
and then it turns out
that they're just more shit.

05:26.542 --> 05:28.209
- Are you even listening to me?

05:29.459 --> 05:30.918
Am I even here?

05:31.918 --> 05:33.083
- What?

05:33.167 --> 05:35.584
Do you give a shit
what anyone says to you?

05:37.083 --> 05:38.292
Wh...
What is your problem?

05:38.918 --> 05:41.417
I'm telling you this thing
about my father,

05:41.501 --> 05:44.083
and it's totally pertaining
to your whole thing,

05:44.167 --> 05:46.459
but you don't even register it.

05:48.209 --> 05:50.000
Wow, you're like...
You're being hostile.

05:50.083 --> 05:54.709
And by the way,
my father walked on the fucking moon.

05:54.792 --> 05:55.834
- Uh, oh...

05:55.918 --> 05:59.250
I told you that, like,
ten times, and zero reaction!

05:59.334 --> 06:02.626
Well, what do you want me to say?
Whoop-dee-doo?

06:02.709 --> 06:04.459
- No, but at least acknowledge it.

06:05.459 --> 06:06.501
At least, like...

06:08.667 --> 06:11.876
If someone tells you that their dad
walked on the moon,

06:11.959 --> 06:14.250
you don't just say
the next thing about you.

06:14.334 --> 06:15.417
- Oh, God...

06:15.501 --> 06:18.042
- Just, like, "Oh, wow, really?"

06:18.125 --> 06:19.459
Something!
- Oh, my God.

06:19.542 --> 06:22.918
- But you're so fucking self-absorbed.
- Jesus, okay.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.042
God.
What is your problem?

06:26.125 --> 06:29.292
My problem is,
you're not a very nice person.

06:29.375 --> 06:32.334
Oh.
Well, you're not a very nice person.

06:32.417 --> 06:35.417
- You're not nice!

06:35.501 --> 06:38.792
- You're not nice!
- You're not nice!

06:38.876 --> 06:41.792
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

06:44.584 --> 06:47.125
Fuck you, dude!

07:07.125 --> 07:09.626
- You okay?

07:09.709 --> 07:10.751
- Yeah.

07:12.751 --> 07:14.834
- Was that, like, an online date?

07:14.918 --> 07:16.459
- Yes.
- Yeah.

07:17.083 --> 07:19.167
See, that... that shit doesn't work.

07:20.167 --> 07:21.292
- That guy was a jerk.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.626
- Well, how do you know that?

07:23.709 --> 07:25.834
I mean, they just might not be
compatible, you know?

07:25.918 --> 07:28.125
- You don't talk to a lady like that.

07:28.209 --> 07:31.334
Oh, why?
'Cause some antiquated bullshit?

07:31.417 --> 07:32.876
It's called equality, okay?

07:32.959 --> 07:34.876
I heard them both yelling
at each other.

07:34.959 --> 07:36.083
- It doesn't matter.

07:36.918 --> 07:39.584
So she can yell at him,
but he can't yell at her?

07:40.375 --> 07:41.417
- That's correct.

07:42.250 --> 07:44.626
- How do you figure?
- I don't have to figure.

07:44.709 --> 07:45.959
It's just what's right.

07:46.584 --> 07:48.626
You don't talk to a lady
like that, ever.

07:49.250 --> 07:50.417
- Why?

07:50.501 --> 07:52.209
Because
ladies are pretty.

07:52.292 --> 07:54.167
They're like angels, all of them.

07:58.250 --> 07:59.334
- Hey, he's right, though.

07:59.417 --> 08:01.209
Online dating
does not work.

08:01.292 --> 08:03.751
What'd you go on, like, Match.com?

08:05.334 --> 08:06.751
Yeah.
That's the worst.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.667
Yeah, well, the problem is
they match you up

08:08.751 --> 08:11.667
based on, like, shared background and
common interests, you know,

08:11.751 --> 08:15.584
so you're like, oh, it's great, we have
so many common interests,

08:15.667 --> 08:18.375
and it turns out, people don't really
connect based on common interest.

08:18.459 --> 08:20.042
- Exactly.
- And what does?

08:20.125 --> 08:22.250
- Chemistry.
- Yep.

08:22.876 --> 08:25.209
Yeah, the problem, these sites
all do the same thing.

08:25.292 --> 08:28.417
It's, like, superficial bullshit
they match you up on, okay?

08:28.501 --> 08:31.292
And then it creates, like,
an illusion of compatibility, right?

08:31.375 --> 08:34.751
Then you just rush into a relationship
and then, duh!

08:34.833 --> 08:36.167
Turns out
we don't like each other.

08:36.292 --> 08:39.417
Like, when the people finally meet
each other, they hate each other.

08:40.042 --> 08:41.583
- 'Cause opposites attract.
- Yes.

08:41.667 --> 08:44.042
'Cause, like, how many couples
do you know, right, and they're...

08:44.125 --> 08:46.667
They're doing so great
and one of them is like,

08:46.751 --> 08:49.250
"Well, I never thought I would be
with somebody like this."

08:49.334 --> 08:51.918
Or, like, "I never thought
I would date a Republican."

08:52.000 --> 08:53.209
Whatever.

08:53.292 --> 08:54.501
- So what do I... What do I do?

08:54.584 --> 08:56.626
Just find somebody
with opposite interests?

08:56.709 --> 08:58.459
- No, that doesn't work either.

08:59.417 --> 09:01.501
Well,
what do you do, then?

09:01.584 --> 09:04.334
I mean, how do you...
How do you find love?

09:04.417 --> 09:06.834
- You know, you'll be in the store,

09:06.918 --> 09:09.083
maybe you're, like, checking the price
of onions or something,

09:09.167 --> 09:11.417
and you just look up
and there he is,

09:11.501 --> 09:13.792
and then your eyes meet
and it just works,

09:13.876 --> 09:15.334
'cause it's just how it works.

09:15.959 --> 09:17.334
- Yeah, that's it.

09:17.417 --> 09:21.167
Okay, well, how am I supposed
to make that happen?

09:21.250 --> 09:23.083
man:
- You can't.

09:24.292 --> 09:25.501
Not by looking for it.

09:26.959 --> 09:29.167
That's why they call it
falling in love.

09:30.375 --> 09:31.834
You can't fall on purpose.

09:33.459 --> 09:34.667
See, I used to be an actor

09:34.751 --> 09:38.292
and I took a class in falling,
trying to make it look like I fell.

09:39.834 --> 09:41.584
Well, I was still trying and I...

09:43.375 --> 09:46.459
I must have fallen over
about a thousand times trying to...

09:47.083 --> 09:50.751
trying to make it look like it was
an accident and I couldn't do it.

09:51.584 --> 09:53.959
So, um...

09:54.667 --> 09:56.918
I... I quit being an actor.

09:58.876 --> 10:01.250
- Well, that's not any help.

10:02.292 --> 10:03.334
I mean, what...

10:04.167 --> 10:05.918
What is a person supposed to do?

10:07.209 --> 10:08.667
- Well, you just accept...

10:09.501 --> 10:12.125
Just accept the fact that love is rare

10:12.209 --> 10:14.626
and it probably
won't happen to you, ever.

10:16.459 --> 10:18.959
Is that what... Is that what you do?
You just accept it?

10:19.209 --> 10:22.000
No.
No, I...

10:22.083 --> 10:23.751
I walk around brokenhearted.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.667
And I get... I get drunk and...

10:29.334 --> 10:30.876
I mean,
I hate being alone.

10:33.459 --> 10:34.501
And...

10:35.501 --> 10:37.459
And someday it'll kill me.

10:43.834 --> 10:45.626
- Hey, Horace.
- Yeah?

10:46.250 --> 10:47.292
- Where's Pete?

10:48.584 --> 10:49.626
- What?

10:50.626 --> 10:51.667
- Where is Pete?

10:53.167 --> 10:54.709
I don't know,
Leo.

10:54.792 --> 10:55.834
- You don't know?

10:56.584 --> 10:57.626
- No, he's...

10:58.250 --> 11:00.000
I don't know, he's been missing for,
like, a week.

11:00.626 --> 11:02.000
- Oh.

11:02.083 --> 11:04.292
Why is he missing?

11:04.375 --> 11:05.959
Because
I haven't seen him.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.626
Wait, you haven't seen him
or he's missing?

11:10.542 --> 11:11.751
- He's missing, okay?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.584
So why aren't you out looking
for him?

11:15.209 --> 11:18.042
Because I don't know where to look for
him because I don't know where he is.

11:18.667 --> 11:21.000
Of course you don't know where he is
if he's missing.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.459
So find out, that's what I mean
by go looking for him.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.209
Find out where he is.

11:26.626 --> 11:28.083
- It's complicated, okay?

11:29.125 --> 11:31.000
No, it isn't.
He's your family.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.834
Uncle Pete is dead and now he's Pete,
and you're Horace.

11:36.542 --> 11:37.876
Isn't that how it works?

11:39.125 --> 11:41.792
- Look, Pete is out there somewhere,

11:42.667 --> 11:43.709
and he's...

11:44.834 --> 11:48.292
He's going through something,
I don't know what it is, and I...

11:51.667 --> 11:53.292
- Thank you.

11:59.584 --> 12:00.667
- Horace, what is...

12:00.751 --> 12:03.584
What is in that bottle, that special
bottle of Leon's, what is in there?

12:04.209 --> 12:06.125
- Apple juice.
- What? Why?

12:07.626 --> 12:09.834
He likes to sit at a bar
and have a drink,

12:09.918 --> 12:12.876
and now he's sober,
so we give him that.

12:12.959 --> 12:14.042
- How did that get started?

12:14.667 --> 12:16.459
- I don't remember.
- All right.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.876
Horace, we...
We have to find a bartender.

12:18.959 --> 12:21.709
- We gotta find Pete.
- Is that what you're going to do now?

12:21.792 --> 12:23.417
- No, I'm gonna take a nap.
- Oh, that's terrific.

12:24.042 --> 12:25.083
- Well, Sylvia...

12:25.167 --> 12:26.501
Well, you want me here or
you don't want me here?

12:26.584 --> 12:28.792
We gotta find a bartender.
I can't stay back here all day.

12:28.876 --> 12:30.626
Okay, okay.

12:32.834 --> 12:33.876
Horace & Pete's.

12:35.626 --> 12:36.667
Yes, it is.

12:40.834 --> 12:41.876
Excuse me?

13:15.334 --> 13:16.375
- Hi.

13:18.834 --> 13:19.959
- Horace.
- Tricia.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.125
Hi.

13:24.209 --> 13:25.626
You okay?
I mean, sorry.

13:30.584 --> 13:31.626
- Pete.

13:32.667 --> 13:33.709
Oh, Horace.

13:34.459 --> 13:37.792
Cock and...
fucking balls in my mouth.

13:38.042 --> 13:39.083
- Okay.

13:40.250 --> 13:43.209
Tricia, tell me what happened, because
the police don't know what happened,

13:43.292 --> 13:45.209
they just found you, and I don't...

13:46.417 --> 13:49.792
He was so upset,
I wanted to help him.

13:51.083 --> 13:56.542
He didn't know what to do about his
medication running out,

13:56.626 --> 14:01.501
and I think he thought we would
just spend the time we had together

14:01.584 --> 14:06.000
until the pills ran out,
and that would be it.

14:07.083 --> 14:09.709
- "It"?
- Yeah.

14:09.792 --> 14:13.042
I didn't think he was going
to kill himself.

14:13.125 --> 14:14.292
- Oh, God.

14:14.375 --> 14:15.417
- Well, Horace.

14:16.751 --> 14:19.375
Nigger balls and ham on Sunday.

14:20.751 --> 14:22.334
- It's Saturday, hon'.

14:22.417 --> 14:24.292
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

14:24.918 --> 14:27.375
My husband yells
worse things in his sleep.

14:35.584 --> 14:36.667
- So what happened?

14:41.876 --> 14:43.751
Did he do this to you?

14:46.584 --> 14:49.792
We rented a car
and went upstate.

14:51.834 --> 14:52.876
It was real nice.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.042
Just the two of us.

14:56.876 --> 14:57.918
But...

14:59.083 --> 15:02.709
One night I woke up
and he was upset.

15:04.125 --> 15:07.417
He was sitting up in bed.

15:07.501 --> 15:08.959
He was...

15:09.042 --> 15:11.250
I think it all
came crashing down on him,

15:13.292 --> 15:15.209
because we were
so happy.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.209
And he was thinking
about when the pills are gone.

15:23.584 --> 15:26.167
And I had this stupid idea.

15:27.501 --> 15:32.751
I said, "What if you stop taking them,
now, while there are still some left?

15:33.709 --> 15:35.792
And we'll be together and I'll help you"

15:36.417 --> 15:37.501
And we can just..."

15:40.209 --> 15:42.792
I don't know, eat organic...

15:42.876 --> 15:46.375
and meditate
and try to manage it.

15:48.626 --> 15:50.083
I thought it was possible.

15:53.626 --> 15:55.375
You know?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.542
I don't think anyone
ever loved Pete before.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.083
He was like a little boy.

16:04.167 --> 16:05.709
He was all new.

16:07.042 --> 16:09.584
And...
It felt like enough.

16:10.375 --> 16:15.167
So I said, "Let's try,"
and he said, "Okay."

16:16.709 --> 16:18.250
And we went home.

16:18.334 --> 16:19.876
He stayed
at my place and...

16:21.959 --> 16:25.716
Kind of locked ourselves in
with the groceries and...

16:25.799 --> 16:27.218
he went off the Probitol.

16:30.516 --> 16:32.101
And after a few days,
well...

16:34.524 --> 16:35.567
You know what it's like.

16:35.651 --> 16:38.196
He started
getting the shakes.

16:38.279 --> 16:41.954
He started seeing things,
getting scared.

16:42.036 --> 16:43.790
Getting mad.

16:43.873 --> 16:47.255
But I thought,
we can do this.

16:47.338 --> 16:48.799
There's a way.

16:48.882 --> 16:49.968
We love each other.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.098
And it got worse.

16:54.225 --> 16:57.899
He flushed the rest of the Probitol
down the toilet.

17:00.444 --> 17:02.240
I got a little scared and then...

17:04.661 --> 17:08.376
Last night,
I got him to sleep...

17:10.253 --> 17:11.298
somehow,

17:12.215 --> 17:15.848
and I slept beside him,
holding him.

17:17.726 --> 17:19.311
And I woke up
in the middle of the night

17:19.395 --> 17:22.819
and he was screaming and throwing
everything in the apartment.

17:26.909 --> 17:28.329
- He did this to you?

17:28.412 --> 17:30.791
He did it to everything,
Horace, he didn't see me.

17:31.417 --> 17:34.172
I wasn't there anymore, he wasn't there
anymore, he just...

17:34.798 --> 17:36.093
went wild
and he tore at everything

17:36.176 --> 17:39.057
and he only hurt me because
I was trying to stop him.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.188
I was trying to hug him...

17:43.271 --> 17:44.315
Cunt potato!

17:45.359 --> 17:47.029
I was trying to hold him.

17:47.112 --> 17:49.659
That's what I had said we'd do,
I'd help him through it.

17:50.284 --> 17:53.123
Dirty Jews
in Fucktown, Alaska!

17:54.000 --> 17:58.049
But he tore at everything
and he pushes me away.

17:59.927 --> 18:02.431
He was so strong, and I...

18:02.515 --> 18:03.600
I fought him.

18:03.684 --> 18:06.563
I thought if we could just get through
this one night of...

18:06.648 --> 18:08.776
Piss-drinking jalopy!

18:08.985 --> 18:11.406
that we could make it.

18:14.620 --> 18:15.664
And then...

18:18.460 --> 18:24.138
You know, he knocked me out and
at that point, I wasn't even that hurt.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.772
I woke up all like this.

18:33.696 --> 18:34.740
And he was gone.

18:40.959 --> 18:45.050
Jesus,
fill my mouth with buttery cum.

18:50.267 --> 18:52.313
I'm really sorry, Tricia.

18:52.396 --> 18:54.066
He never hurt anybody before.

18:57.363 --> 18:58.407
Never.

19:01.789 --> 19:04.292
Can't say that anymore.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.923
I'm so sorry.

19:17.984 --> 19:23.870
Wow, Hulk Hogan got awarded
$121 million for that sex tape thing.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.039
- Mm-hmm.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.875
That'd buy a lot
of prison vitamins, huh?

19:26.959 --> 19:28.670
Yeah, but they're gonna
appeal it.

19:28.753 --> 19:30.339
- Who, Nick Denton?
- Yeah, for sure.

19:30.966 --> 19:32.803
They're not just gonna
give him $121 million.

19:33.428 --> 19:35.015
Kurt:
- Oh, I fucking hate that guy so much,

19:35.099 --> 19:36.601
that square-head bitch.

19:36.685 --> 19:38.646
That smug face
he has.

19:38.729 --> 19:41.151
So delighted
to invade people's privacy.

19:41.569 --> 19:44.365
Can't wait to moralize when
that shit happens to a woman,

19:44.532 --> 19:46.911
but the second it's a powerful man,

19:46.995 --> 19:50.001
then it's okay to just drag his name
through the mud.

19:50.084 --> 19:51.253
What a scumbag.

19:51.336 --> 19:53.841
So what's he getting charged, uh,
if you break it down, for that tape?

19:53.924 --> 19:55.802
Like a million dollars a second?

19:55.886 --> 19:57.848
Oh, it's beautiful.
I love justice.

19:57.931 --> 20:00.227
It's not justice.
It's a disgusting man.

20:00.311 --> 20:03.024
- Nick Denton?
- No, fuck it... Hulk Hogan!

20:03.107 --> 20:05.778
What a vile human being.
- Why?

20:05.862 --> 20:07.240
That's the guy
whose rights we gotta protect?

20:07.324 --> 20:10.662
Really? $120 million?
- Yeah.

20:10.746 --> 20:14.711
That's enough to educate
every fucking kid in Africa.

20:14.794 --> 20:17.258
Well, they gotta work for it.
You just can't throw money at them.

20:17.342 --> 20:21.057
120-fucking-million dollars
to a wrestler, right?

20:21.140 --> 20:22.184
- Yes.

20:22.267 --> 20:23.853
So he can fuck his friend's wife
and her husband can film it

20:23.937 --> 20:25.898
and they gotta be able
to do that in privacy, really?

20:25.982 --> 20:27.484
- Yes.
- For fuck's sake.

20:27.567 --> 20:29.405
- Of course.
- That's the...

20:29.488 --> 20:34.246
The world has to give $120 million, that
kind of resource to that fucking pig?

20:34.331 --> 20:35.624
Really?

20:35.707 --> 20:38.045
Oh, yeah, no, no, it's not
a woman's thing, okay?

20:38.128 --> 20:40.841
It's about privacy.
- This is not about privacy!

20:40.925 --> 20:45.977
It's about giving $120 million
to a man in yellow panties

20:46.060 --> 20:48.272
so he can fuck
his friend's wife!

20:48.356 --> 20:49.524
That's what's happening!

20:49.607 --> 20:51.485
Well, and what about the woman
who was in the tape?

20:51.569 --> 20:52.613
What about her?

20:52.697 --> 20:55.452
Shouldn't she at least
get $100 million, too?

20:55.535 --> 20:58.249
No, that's true.
This is true. This is true.

20:58.332 --> 21:01.796
I mean, this is, like, the highest
payout in sex tape history, right?

21:01.879 --> 21:04.634
And she's the one who actually
got fucked, so...

21:04.759 --> 21:10.061
She got to get fucked by the Hulkster,
which was her lifelong dream!

21:10.145 --> 21:12.023
- Wow, that sucks.
- Really.

21:12.107 --> 21:15.529
The world has to award that kind of
money to that fucking guy, really?

21:15.612 --> 21:16.656
That guy?

21:16.740 --> 21:17.992
- It's not...
- Come on.

21:18.075 --> 21:19.119
I can't even.

21:19.202 --> 21:21.373
It's not just his rights,
it's your rights, too.

21:21.457 --> 21:22.792
This affects everyone.

21:22.917 --> 21:23.961
It's a good thing.

21:24.128 --> 21:27.301
This is the end of these scumbag blogs
destroying people's lives.

21:27.384 --> 21:29.054
How could you be against this?

21:30.765 --> 21:33.145
You know, I feel bad for black people,
because...

21:33.228 --> 21:37.235
This is not about them, but somehow,
they got dragged into this shit, too.

21:37.319 --> 21:39.238
Well, 'cause he was mad
his daughter's dating a black guy.

21:39.323 --> 21:41.076
- Right.
- I feel bad for that, too,

21:41.159 --> 21:43.037
because he was really a hero
to everyone, you know?

21:43.120 --> 21:44.164
Black kids...

21:44.332 --> 21:46.001
As much as I loved him,
so did black kids,

21:46.085 --> 21:48.881
and then you get to be an adult
and you have that shattered,

21:48.964 --> 21:51.512
that dream that, you know,
that your hero likes you

21:51.594 --> 21:52.805
and lets you fuck his daughter?

21:52.888 --> 21:54.015
That's just shitty.

21:54.182 --> 21:56.521
But that still doesn't excuse
Nick Denton, okay?

21:56.603 --> 21:58.816
And by the way, where else are you
supposed to say the N-word

21:58.899 --> 22:01.278
if not at home
after banging your friend's wife?

22:01.362 --> 22:02.781
- I don't know where he is!

22:05.077 --> 22:06.121
Leon.

22:07.832 --> 22:10.253
I don't know where he is.

22:10.420 --> 22:11.464
Okay?

22:12.132 --> 22:13.217
Pete's my brother.

22:15.011 --> 22:16.430
He's my brother, Sylvie.

22:16.515 --> 22:18.518
He's not my cousin,
he's my brother!

22:19.603 --> 22:21.648
And he's missing.

22:22.483 --> 22:24.529
And I don't know
what's wrong with him

22:25.113 --> 22:27.909
and I don't know where he is!

22:33.253 --> 22:35.131
Hey, Horace,
uh, where's Pete?

22:38.554 --> 22:41.476
- Oh! Fuck! Oh, fuck!
- Horace!

22:41.560 --> 22:43.521
- All right, whoa!
- Jesus Christ, whoa!

22:43.605 --> 22:44.815
Hey, man!
Take it down a notch!

22:44.899 --> 22:46.359
- Shut your fucking mouth!

22:47.028 --> 22:49.698
I'm just trying
to break the tension, dude!

22:49.782 --> 22:51.827
God damn, this family's
aggressive.

22:51.911 --> 22:53.665
Fuck.

22:54.249 --> 22:57.171
Boy, that was fucking quick.
- What the hell's that?

22:57.504 --> 22:58.757
- Hey, what's going on in here?

22:58.840 --> 23:00.636
- Hey, hi, Ricky.
- Hi, Sylvia.

23:00.969 --> 23:02.013
Where's Pete?

23:02.138 --> 23:03.849
Oh, don't ask that,
they punch you in the face here.

23:03.933 --> 23:06.354
- Shut up, Kurt!
- Fuck you, man.

23:06.438 --> 23:09.318
Hey, what the...
Hey, hey, what is going on in here?

23:09.401 --> 23:10.612
- It's lively in here.

23:11.029 --> 23:12.574
So what happened?
Did... What...

23:12.658 --> 23:13.909
Did somebody call you guys?

23:13.992 --> 23:15.036
- No.

23:15.286 --> 23:16.330
We just...

23:17.415 --> 23:18.459
Oh.

23:21.047 --> 23:22.091
- Hi, there.

23:22.174 --> 23:23.218
- Oh, shit, you're the mayor!

23:23.301 --> 23:25.305
I... Excuse me...
You're the fucking mayor!

23:25.389 --> 23:27.267
That's how my constituents
know me, yeah.

23:27.350 --> 23:28.394
- The fucking mayor.

23:28.477 --> 23:29.854
- What's your name?
- Kurt.

23:29.938 --> 23:31.190
- Good to meet you, Kurt.

23:31.274 --> 23:32.317
How's it going?

23:32.401 --> 23:33.444
Yeah,
you're big as shit.

23:33.528 --> 23:38.161
Yeah, hey, Horace, um, Pete asked me
to bring the mayor in to see the place.

23:38.245 --> 23:39.539
We were
in the neighborhood.

23:39.622 --> 23:41.751
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

23:41.834 --> 23:46.009
Is it true that the NYPD is as large
as the standing army of France?

23:46.092 --> 23:47.428
- No, that's not true.
- Mr. Mayor...

23:47.512 --> 23:50.392
That's good, because, I was gonna say,
how do you justify that?

23:50.475 --> 23:53.732
Maintaining a national army
against your own citizens?

23:53.814 --> 23:54.941
- Your premise is wrong.

23:55.025 --> 23:56.193
We don't have an army,
we have a...

23:56.277 --> 23:57.362
- Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor.
- How you doing?

23:57.446 --> 23:59.158
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure, man.

23:59.241 --> 24:01.495
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

24:01.579 --> 24:03.832
It's, like, 3:00.
Something like that.

24:04.124 --> 24:05.461
- May I quote you on that?

24:06.546 --> 24:09.384
Wait, so you're saying if France
invaded tomorrow, okay?

24:09.468 --> 24:10.762
Your NYPD...

24:10.845 --> 24:12.724
Wait, wait.
It's your NYPD.

24:12.807 --> 24:14.685
It's all our NYPD.
- Yeah, whatever, man.

24:14.770 --> 24:16.313
You're telling me France would kick
the NYPD...

24:16.397 --> 24:17.440
- Hey, fuck that!

24:17.524 --> 24:20.404
- Hey, hey, pull your ears in, Dom.
- Calm down, calm down.

24:20.488 --> 24:22.492
We don't have a problem with France,
it's okay.

24:22.575 --> 24:23.702
- Where's Pete?

24:23.786 --> 24:25.372
Pete is...
Pete is missing.

24:26.081 --> 24:27.501
Missing?
For how long?

24:28.085 --> 24:30.255
About a week.
He went off his meds.

24:30.339 --> 24:32.092
- Oh, man.
- Just disappeared.

24:33.637 --> 24:37.309
- Why didn't you guys tell me?
- We didn't know you guys were close.

24:38.061 --> 24:40.022
All right, uh, let me help you
try and find him.

24:40.106 --> 24:41.316
I'll get some guys working on it.

24:41.401 --> 24:42.443
- All right.

24:42.528 --> 24:44.531
So Ricky,
what the hell's going on here?

24:44.614 --> 24:46.535
- Okay, well...

24:46.660 --> 24:50.417
Pete apparently was applying for
landmark status for this place.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.962
He was?
He never said anything about that.

24:53.046 --> 24:54.883
It's 'cause he thinks you're trying
to close the place down.

24:54.966 --> 24:57.680
Yeah, so he asked me
to bring the mayor in.

24:57.763 --> 24:59.975
So this is
the famous Horace & Pete's.

25:00.977 --> 25:04.191
What a great place, a real
Brooklyn landmark.

25:04.275 --> 25:05.694
- Mr. Mayor, meet Horace.

25:05.778 --> 25:07.280
Horace,
good to meet you, man.

25:07.363 --> 25:08.908
- Hey, Mr. Mayor.
- Good to meet you.

25:08.991 --> 25:11.371
So, where's Pete?

25:17.381 --> 25:18.718
Can I at least get a beer?

25:18.843 --> 25:20.052
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

25:21.473 --> 25:22.516
- All right.

27:04.950 --> 27:05.994
- Hey.

27:06.078 --> 27:07.329
Where the fuck are you?

27:08.749 --> 27:09.834
- What do you mean?

27:09.918 --> 27:11.379
I mean
what the hell is this?

27:11.462 --> 27:13.340
- What, I'm here.
- No, you're not.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.467
You're not here.
- Hey.

27:15.469 --> 27:16.513
Leave me alone.

27:17.598 --> 27:18.892
- I'm not gonna leave you alone.

27:18.975 --> 27:21.605
You tell me what the hell you think
you're doing here.

27:21.689 --> 27:23.274
Hey,
you're the one who's not here.

27:23.358 --> 27:25.697
You fucking died,
so get lost.

27:25.780 --> 27:26.824
Fucking ghost.

27:27.408 --> 27:29.870
I may be a ghost,
but what are you?

27:29.954 --> 27:31.373
A ghost can haunt people.

27:31.833 --> 27:34.087
You can't haunt people
while you're alive, stupid.

27:34.170 --> 27:35.798
- Please, leave me alone.

27:35.881 --> 27:36.925
Where are you
this time, huh?

27:37.008 --> 27:38.678
Where are you now?
Right now?

27:38.761 --> 27:41.474
What, are you on a park bench
someplace, rocking back and forth?

27:41.558 --> 27:42.601
You're...

27:43.061 --> 27:45.106
You under an overpass on the BQE?

27:45.190 --> 27:46.442
What is it
this time, Pete?

27:46.525 --> 27:47.819
'Cause you sure as hell ain't here.

27:47.903 --> 27:49.447
I'm here!
I'm right here!

27:49.740 --> 27:50.783
- Oh, yeah?

27:50.908 --> 27:52.285
What?

27:52.369 --> 27:54.915
You think you can yell at me
and make me leave?

27:54.999 --> 27:56.710
You can't bully me.

27:57.545 --> 27:58.589
You never could.

27:59.841 --> 28:00.885
Fucking loser.

28:01.051 --> 28:02.471
- Please, leave me alone.

28:06.311 --> 28:07.981
Fucking guy.

28:12.822 --> 28:17.331
What a goddamn shame,
the way you've turned out.

28:17.414 --> 28:21.964
You had a real chance at life,
before you went into the basket.

28:24.510 --> 28:27.641
You came out of the gate of life like...

28:29.019 --> 28:30.062
Good looking kid.

28:30.395 --> 28:31.816
You could talk to anyone.

28:33.652 --> 28:36.448
Everybody liked you,
everybody listened to you.

28:38.494 --> 28:39.579
You were handsome.

28:40.206 --> 28:41.250
You could dance.

28:44.713 --> 28:46.716
And what you had,
that thing you had?

28:47.385 --> 28:48.428
Courage.

28:48.512 --> 28:50.099
You had it in fucking spades.

28:51.226 --> 28:54.690
You were such a good ballplayer,
but you wanted to try hockey.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.611
You couldn't skate for shit.

28:58.280 --> 29:01.286
So we all said, "Hey, Pete,
stick with the baseball."

29:02.412 --> 29:03.957
"Hockey's not your thing."

29:04.583 --> 29:07.004
But you said,
"Fuck that, I want to try it."

29:07.881 --> 29:10.176
And the coach
of the baseball team, you know,

29:10.260 --> 29:11.888
he was afraid you were gonna injure
yourself.

29:11.971 --> 29:15.435
He said, "You go out for hockey,
you're fucking off the team,"

29:15.518 --> 29:16.855
'cause he thought
you'd back down, you know?

29:16.938 --> 29:18.149
But not you.

29:18.232 --> 29:21.154
You went out,
and you go out on the ice,

29:22.531 --> 29:25.913
and you fall down
and you fall down.

29:27.165 --> 29:29.044
You never made the team, but you...

29:29.628 --> 29:30.963
You never regretted it.

29:31.047 --> 29:32.424
You remember that,
Pete?

29:32.507 --> 29:33.551
Remember...

29:33.635 --> 29:35.138
Remember when you...
when you went out for hockey?

29:35.221 --> 29:36.307
- Yeah, yeah, I remember that.

29:36.390 --> 29:39.812
No, you don't.
'Cause it never happened.

29:41.816 --> 29:43.861
What? No.
I remember it.

29:44.196 --> 29:45.865
- No, you just crazied that up.

29:47.534 --> 29:48.703
That never happened
any more

29:48.787 --> 29:52.460
than you were chased by that
fucking snake in the Port Authority,

29:52.543 --> 29:54.839
that first time when
they put you in the hospital.

29:54.923 --> 29:56.133
- What?

29:56.218 --> 29:57.761
Or any more
than any of this is real here.

29:57.845 --> 29:58.888
- All right, get out!

29:58.973 --> 30:01.852
Will you just...
get out of here and leave me alone!

30:02.270 --> 30:03.313
- Then make me.

30:03.940 --> 30:04.983
Make me.

30:05.067 --> 30:08.072
You're the one who put me here
in the first place, you dumb idiot.

30:08.155 --> 30:09.241
- You can't do that.

30:10.076 --> 30:11.203
You can't make me...

30:13.123 --> 30:16.586
I may be crazy and, yeah,
maybe I see things.

30:17.088 --> 30:18.132
But...

30:19.217 --> 30:21.012
There are things
in my life that are real.

30:21.095 --> 30:22.390
They really happened.

30:22.473 --> 30:23.976
And they're in my head.

30:24.059 --> 30:25.979
They're in my memory
and they're in my heart

30:26.062 --> 30:28.316
and you can't take
that away from me, Pete.

30:28.401 --> 30:29.444
You can't, Pete!

30:30.487 --> 30:32.283
I played hockey.

30:32.950 --> 30:35.204
I sucked at it,
but I loved it.

30:35.872 --> 30:39.086
The guys in hockey were cooler
than the guys in baseball.

30:41.257 --> 30:43.177
The baseball guys,
they were just always uptight.

30:43.928 --> 30:47.393
And baseball is too clean.
Hockey was messy.

30:47.477 --> 30:50.273
And yeah,
we were all a bunch of losers,

30:50.356 --> 30:53.946
but the tryouts were so much fun
and when I got cut, I didn't care.

30:54.030 --> 30:57.411
And I told you that,
and you said, "Yeah, okay.

30:57.495 --> 30:58.746
Fuck 'em, do what you want."

30:58.829 --> 30:59.999
That happened!

31:00.083 --> 31:01.126
- Did it?

31:01.210 --> 31:02.253
I don't know.

31:02.837 --> 31:05.133
Who knows with you?

31:07.888 --> 31:08.932
- Horace.

31:09.975 --> 31:12.062
Horace, you remember,
just tell him.

31:14.274 --> 31:15.360
Horace!

31:15.985 --> 31:19.075
Look at you,
yelling at him like some fag.

31:19.158 --> 31:20.911
You're a fag.
- You're a fag!

31:20.994 --> 31:22.038
- I'm not a fag.

31:22.832 --> 31:24.251
- Would you please leave?

31:24.334 --> 31:25.837
I'm asking you nice.

31:27.631 --> 31:30.428
You can make me leave anytime
you want, you know?

31:30.555 --> 31:31.597
This is all you.

31:31.722 --> 31:33.142
You conjured me up.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.522
You put yourself
here.

31:35.605 --> 31:36.815
Why can't you just...

31:37.775 --> 31:41.240
Just fix your messed-up mind and get
back to your normal life?

31:41.323 --> 31:43.702
I mean, this is just you fighting you.

31:43.785 --> 31:44.955
What's... What is it?

31:45.038 --> 31:47.125
What's so fucking complicated
about this?

31:47.209 --> 31:48.420
Just fix it.

31:48.503 --> 31:50.715
Why can't you do that?

31:50.798 --> 31:51.842
- 'Cause I...

31:51.925 --> 31:53.596
I just can't,
'cause I'm sick.

31:54.346 --> 31:55.765
And there ain't no cure.

31:55.849 --> 31:59.147
Can't you see?
There's no figuring it out.

31:59.939 --> 32:02.653
There's no going back to what I was.

32:03.572 --> 32:05.325
Not even the guy
that I was here.

32:05.783 --> 32:08.705
Well, what are you gonna do?
You gonna just give up?

32:10.167 --> 32:11.294
- I wish you'd let me.

32:13.340 --> 32:15.051
Why do you think
you're here?

32:15.134 --> 32:16.511
I mean,
you know you're not here, right?

32:16.596 --> 32:17.639
- I know.

32:18.515 --> 32:19.559
I know.
I'm...

32:20.268 --> 32:22.564
I'm probably freezing
to death somewhere

32:22.648 --> 32:26.656
or I'm waving a tire iron in a deli
somewhere.

32:29.910 --> 32:31.497
That's why I'm in here, I'm...

32:32.207 --> 32:33.626
At least in here, it's...

32:36.839 --> 32:40.555
Look, Pete,
I got no options, all right?

32:40.639 --> 32:43.059
There's no good story
for me down the road.

32:44.604 --> 32:45.648
I'm just unlucky.

32:47.150 --> 32:48.193
That's all.

32:49.320 --> 32:51.366
I got a bad straw.

32:53.412 --> 32:56.626
But that's why I like being here.

33:00.841 --> 33:02.511
I know it's not gonna last,
I...

33:03.095 --> 33:05.933
Either some cop
is gonna knock me out

33:06.018 --> 33:09.148
or I'm gonna get shot full
of some shit in the hospital.

33:11.027 --> 33:12.069
Or I'll die.

33:16.579 --> 33:19.917
But can you just
let me have this right now?

33:21.629 --> 33:22.673
Would you please?

33:22.798 --> 33:23.883
Just let me have it.

33:25.385 --> 33:26.764
Just a little piece.

33:30.520 --> 33:31.564
- Okay, son.

33:32.775 --> 33:34.109
You go ahead and have it.

33:41.164 --> 33:43.418
And you sure did
play hockey.

33:43.877 --> 33:45.839
I was just fucking with you.

33:46.256 --> 33:47.802
Huh?

33:56.108 --> 33:57.694
- Dad?

34:40.771 --> 34:43.735
Paul Simon:
- Hell no

34:45.196 --> 34:50.831
I can't complain
about my problems

34:52.250 --> 34:57.259
I'm okay the way things are

34:58.553 --> 35:03.939
I pull my stool up
to the bar

35:05.775 --> 35:09.239
At Horace and Pete's

35:13.037 --> 35:18.046
Sometimes
I wonder

35:18.548 --> 35:24.016
Why do we tear ourselves
to pieces?

35:24.433 --> 35:29.568
I just need some time to think

35:30.820 --> 35:36.038
Or maybe I just need
a drink

35:38.082 --> 35:41.590
At Horace and Pete's

35:50.063 --> 35:53.569
Horace and Pete

35:54.305 --> 36:00.490
