Would it not be something,
when all this has blown over, of course,

48:57.310 --> 49:01.178
if Alak and Christie actually got married?

49:01.355 --> 49:04.939
Are you trying to ruin my bath?

49:05.109 --> 49:09.398
I have little interest
in being in-law to Rafe McCawley.

49:10.573 --> 49:17.069
If Christie were in the family, she would
feel comfortable coming to us for anything.

49:17.246 --> 49:21.455
Dear, her father
can give her anything she wants.

49:23.794 --> 49:26.376
-You're right.
-Hmm.

49:28.257 --> 49:30.543
He works very hard.

49:32.970 --> 49:36.462
It's such a dangerous job, don't you think?

49:37.141 --> 49:42.101
God forbid anything should ever happen
to Rafe or Ouentin.

49:43.564 --> 49:48.308
Christie's already lost so much.
She'd be left with so much to take care of.

49:55.743 --> 49:58.155
-The mines.
-Yes.

49:59.413 --> 50:01.244
The mines.

50:02.249 --> 50:06.208
If she were family, we'd be forced to help her.

50:09.340 --> 50:10.455
Well,

50:12.218 --> 50:15.005
it is our job to help our family.

50:15.846 --> 50:16.926
(CHUCKLES)

50:18.641 --> 50:20.973
I appreciate how you see things.

50:22.895 --> 50:26.058
Do you appreciate when I do this?

50:29.110 --> 50:30.099
(SIGHS)

50:33.406 --> 50:36.523
(WHISPERS) I think a wedding
is exactly what this town needs.

50:57.054 --> 50:59.545
You're just gonna sit there all day
without talking?

51:03.728 --> 51:05.059
You know what you are?

51:05.646 --> 51:10.640
You are very, very disconcerting.

51:12.236 --> 51:13.737
You know that?

51:17.742 --> 51:19.073
Okay, whatever.

51:19.243 --> 51:23.202
As long as we're both trapped here,
we might as well eat something.

51:31.005 --> 51:32.415
I'm not trapped in here.

51:37.428 --> 51:40.420
If I wanted, I could have grabbed your wrist,
broken every ﬁnger on your hand,

51:40.598 --> 51:43.305
taken the key card to this cell
which you left hanging from your belt.

51:43.476 --> 51:45.888
Before you knew what was happening,
I'd already be out of this cage

51:46.061 --> 51:48.518
and separating your head
from the rest of you with one of my blades.

51:50.691 --> 51:52.306
What is wrong with you?

51:54.028 --> 51:56.110
You wanted conversation.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.362
That's conversation?

52:01.285 --> 52:05.198
You know, I think you're mad
and you're taking out your anger on me.

52:05.372 --> 52:07.237
I'm not mad.

52:07.416 --> 52:09.202
I don't believe you.

52:11.253 --> 52:14.791
I think you're angry that
your scavenger friend left you here.

52:16.509 --> 52:19.842
What is it
with you and that Nolan guy anyway?

52:24.183 --> 52:25.593
Fine.

52:34.485 --> 52:35.600
He saved me.

52:39.240 --> 52:40.229
What?

52:40.407 --> 52:42.068
You heard.

52:45.579 --> 52:46.864
Yeah.

52:48.749 --> 52:51.411
You know, it was kinda like that
with me and Clancy.

52:57.007 --> 53:02.252
I was on a bad path,
but Clancy saw something in me.

53:04.473 --> 53:06.213
He gave me a second chance.

53:09.603 --> 53:11.343
How about you?

53:11.522 --> 53:13.934
What did Nolan do to save you?

53:17.111 --> 53:19.602
Something I couldn't do for myself.

53:21.031 --> 53:22.191
Which was?

53:25.119 --> 53:26.825
He murdered my parents.

53:29.290 --> 53:31.121
This is good.

53:37.214 --> 53:38.795
RAFE: What's taking so long?

53:38.966 --> 53:40.172
Hey, Nolan?

53:40.342 --> 53:42.799
When are you gonna show us
why you're such a famous tracker?

53:44.430 --> 53:46.637
Well, before we try and ﬁgure out
where he went,

53:46.807 --> 53:49.549
it might help to ﬁgure out
what happened here.

53:49.810 --> 53:53.143
The site's been pretty badly trampled down.

53:53.314 --> 53:54.303
But it appears that

53:54.481 --> 53:57.894
we got two separate sets of prints
arriving from two different directions,

53:58.068 --> 54:02.437
which suggests that Luke and his killer
didn't come out here together to duke it out.

54:02.615 --> 54:06.107
They arrived separately,
maybe for a meeting,

54:08.329 --> 54:10.035
one ﬁrey didn't want to have in town.

54:10.205 --> 54:11.331
Well, that's a whole lot of assumptions.

54:11.498 --> 54:13.113
It's more like deductions,
but I don't wanna quibble.

54:13.292 --> 54:17.080
Now, an argument breaks out,
like our dog walker says he heard.

54:17.922 --> 54:19.002
Then a ﬁght.

54:20.341 --> 54:21.751
Excuse me.

54:26.388 --> 54:28.253
Luke is stabbed.

54:30.476 --> 54:35.937
Maybe then the killer loses the knife, which
is why he pulls out the cold-ﬁre weapon.

54:40.694 --> 54:42.434
Only now, Luke's got a weapon, too.

54:42.863 --> 54:43.852

54:58.295 --> 54:59.205
Okay, all right.

54:59.380 --> 55:03.464
So, this is the trail
he left when he ran off, right?

55:03.634 --> 55:05.249
Now, you see?

55:05.427 --> 55:08.385
The prints on the right are crisp.
We can almost read the boot prints.

55:08.555 --> 55:11.592
But the ones on the left are dragging.
They never quite break the ground.

55:12.977 --> 55:17.061
So, if he was cut, but he didn't bleed...

55:18.399 --> 55:20.139
Cybernetic implant.

55:20.567 --> 55:23.900
We're looking for an lndogene,
one with a bad left leg.

55:28.909 --> 55:31.070
Ben, my assistant.

55:31.245 --> 55:35.534
He is lndogene, and last night,
he told me he had hurt his leg.

55:36.917 --> 55:38.532
Where's Ben now?

55:42.464 --> 55:43.749
Hey, Ben.

They should hit Bissel Pass just after sunset.

1:08:32.400 --> 1:08:34.391
We could make a difference.

1:08:38.698 --> 1:08:41.064
They've got lndogenes in that town.

1:08:41.242 --> 1:08:44.484
They could work up a Burkus rig
for this sphere, focus the energy,

1:08:44.662 --> 1:08:46.823
create a weapon
the Volge wouldn't even see coming.

1:08:46.998 --> 1:08:48.534
We'd burn out the sphere.
We'd be left with nothing.

1:08:48.708 --> 1:08:50.244
Yeah, I know.

1:08:50.418 --> 1:08:52.534
I'm sorry.
But some things, they just need to be done.

Saving your ass, sweetheartl

1:10:14.836 --> 1:10:17.953
The terra-sphere
has enough energy to wipe out the Volga.

1:10:18.131 --> 1:10:20.622
Doc Yewll will need to conﬁgure it
to focus the blast.

1:10:21.301 --> 1:10:22.586
Once its online,

1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:26.628
we've got to hold the Volge in the pass
until we can blow the terra-sphere.

1:10:26.806 --> 1:10:29.092
How hard can that be?

1:10:29.267 --> 1:10:31.303

Hold your ﬁre until you get the order.

1:11:14.020 --> 1:11:18.935
We have a superior position up here.
But the Volge are climbers.

1:11:19.108 --> 1:11:22.475
So just keep pushing them
to the centre of the pass.

1:11:22.654 --> 1:11:26.067
That's where the blast will be focused,
at the bottom of the canyon.

1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:28.697
The terra-sphere
will obliterate anything in its path.

1:11:28.868 --> 1:11:32.360

take cover or you'll get caught in the blast.
