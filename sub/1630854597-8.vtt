<i>It's the ultimate cooking competition</i>

01:06.833 --> 01:08.234

<i>This is </i>Cook at all Costs.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.307
What's up, home cooks?

01:14.374 --> 01:15.442
Whoo!

01:15.508 --> 01:17.377
-Whoo!

01:17.444 --> 01:19.879
Welcome to <i>Cook at all Costs.</i>
How you feeling?

01:19.946 --> 01:22.348
-Living the dream, Jordan.
-Are you here to win some money?

01:22.415 --> 01:24.417
-Yes.
-Yes, I am!

01:24.484 --> 01:28.021
All right. Taneisha, Roni, Cindy,
for your first challenge,

01:28.088 --> 01:29.823
you'll be making a dish of your choosing

01:29.889 --> 01:32.358
using ingredient boxes
being prepared right now

01:32.425 --> 01:34.427
in the back pantry by our guest judge.

01:35.361 --> 01:39.065
He's a chef and entrepreneur
who is named in <i>Forbes </i>30 Under 30

01:39.132 --> 01:42.869
for his work in New York kitchens
and his business Plant People,

01:43.603 --> 01:44.871
Chef Gabe Kennedy.

01:46.806 --> 01:49.676
Cooking for Chef Kennedy
makes me feel super nervous.

01:49.742 --> 01:52.312
Like, I actually can't believe
that someone of his stature

01:52.378 --> 01:54.347
is tasting my food.

01:54.414 --> 01:56.816
Chef Gabe, send out those boxes.

02:05.091 --> 02:08.128
You'll start by blind bidding
on these three ingredient boxes

02:08.194 --> 02:10.797
using your bank of $25,000.

02:11.931 --> 02:14.367
Remember, whoever wins the competition

02:14.434 --> 02:17.103
goes home with all the cash
that remains in their bank.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.473
The minimum bid is $2,500.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.342
Go ahead and lock in your bids now.

02:23.443 --> 02:27.580
I really like good quality things,
but I love a deal.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.115
I work in banking,

02:29.182 --> 02:31.484
so I wanna spend the least amount of money

02:31.551 --> 02:33.386
to get the best possible box

02:33.453 --> 02:35.288
and make an amazing dish.

02:36.422 --> 02:39.125
I would prefer
to save on ingredients.

02:39.192 --> 02:41.694
I am not about to waste my money.

02:41.761 --> 02:45.165
I'd rather just play it safe
and just roll with the punches.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.535
All right, let's check those bids.

02:48.601 --> 02:50.603
Taneisha, let's take a look at your bid.

02:51.404 --> 02:53.840
$2,500. Let's keep it low.

02:53.907 --> 02:54.908
Yes.

02:54.974 --> 02:55.909
Roni.

02:56.609 --> 02:57.610
$3,000.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.145
-$3,000.
-Okay.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.280
And Cindy.

03:01.314 --> 03:03.183
Oh!

03:03.249 --> 03:05.418
-$3,000 for Cindy.
-Yeah.

03:05.485 --> 03:09.489
Roni, Cindy, both of you bid
the exact same amount, $3,000.

03:09.556 --> 03:12.158
But, Roni, you entered your bid first,

03:12.225 --> 03:14.294
which means you get the Spend Box.

03:16.296 --> 03:18.798
Cindy, you get the Surprise Box.

03:19.832 --> 03:21.568
Of course, Taneisha,
you had the lowest bid,

03:21.634 --> 03:23.670
which means you get the Save Box.

03:25.905 --> 03:30.109
Home cooks, you have one hour
to create your best out-of-the-box dish.

03:30.176 --> 03:32.979
And if you didn't get
the box you wanted, don't worry.

03:33.046 --> 03:36.249
There's plenty of auction upgrades
coming to you down the line.

03:37.250 --> 03:41.354
Taneisha, Roni, Cindy,
are you ready to cook at all costs?

03:41.421 --> 03:43.389
Yeah!

03:43.456 --> 03:45.992
Great. Because your time starts now!

03:54.267 --> 03:58.238
Cranberries,
mushroom, chicken thighs.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.006
I have the Save Box.

04:00.073 --> 04:00.940
Yes.

04:01.007 --> 04:02.475
I'm seeing the chicken thighs.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.177
Okay, this I can work with for sure.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.680
It's versatile. You know,
I can go so many different ways with this,

04:07.747 --> 04:11.050
and then the mushrooms,
and the cranberries, the rice pouch.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.219
I don't care
if it's the cheapest ingredients.

04:13.286 --> 04:15.388
I know that I will get all these items

04:15.455 --> 04:18.658
to talk together
and become one happy family.

04:18.725 --> 04:20.093
We're gonna work with it.

04:20.159 --> 04:22.629
Rice cakes. Whole chicken.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.931
I'm not really sure what that is.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.566
Mushroom of some kind?

04:26.633 --> 04:29.068
Sumac, no idea what that is.

04:29.135 --> 04:32.505
This Surprise Box is something
that I didn't expect.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.774
I've never cooked with sumac before.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.676
I don't eat goat cheese either.

04:36.743 --> 04:37.577
Ugh.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.912
Oh, my chicken has got legs.

04:39.979 --> 04:41.047
Oh, and the head too.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.749
Wow!

04:42.815 --> 04:45.885
I have a whole chicken
with the head and the feet.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.688
Oh, my gosh.
I think I could just chop that off.

04:50.056 --> 04:51.224
I need to remove them

04:51.291 --> 04:53.626
so it looks like something
that I'm familiar with.

04:54.193 --> 04:55.561
Okay.

04:57.397 --> 04:58.331
Got some quinoa.

04:58.398 --> 04:59.666
I've got za'atar,

04:59.732 --> 05:02.201
pitted sour red cherries, halloumi cheese.

05:02.268 --> 05:04.070
I have some great ingredients in the box.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.238
Duck breast.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.673
I've never cooked duck before,

05:06.739 --> 05:08.875
but I know duck is good, duck's expensive.

05:08.941 --> 05:12.845
I'm pretty happy with my box.
It is a bit of a steal for 3,000 bucks.

05:12.912 --> 05:15.148
I got lucky. You know,
I got a more expensive box

05:15.214 --> 05:18.084
with some high-end ingredients,
but I'm a man without a plan.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.787
I need to figure out exactly
what I'm gonna do with the ingredients.

05:21.354 --> 05:22.922
I'm not 100% sure what these are.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.160
All right, see some proteins out here.

05:27.226 --> 05:30.229
Taneisha, you got boneless chicken thighs
in the Save Box.

05:30.296 --> 05:33.299
Roni, spending up with some duck breast.

05:33.366 --> 05:36.035
Cindy, a whole chicken
in the Surprise Box.

05:36.102 --> 05:36.936
Yeah.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.672
I don't have time
to roast a whole chicken,

05:39.739 --> 05:43.009
but I can use it to make a broth
with the pressure cooker.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.411
Then the meat would be nice
and tender too, at the same time.

05:45.978 --> 05:48.781
I have three kids,
and they are the world to me.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.484
They love to eat.
They are not picky eaters.

05:51.551 --> 05:53.019
You name it, they'll-- they'll eat it.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.954
I like to cook Chinese food,

05:55.021 --> 05:57.724
Vietnamese food, Korean, and Japanese.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.693
So with this broth,
I know where I'm gonna take this dish,

06:00.760 --> 06:01.761
and I'm making ramen.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.231
I'm making the dough for my noodles.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.867
I'm using what I have
in my basic pantry ingredients,

06:07.934 --> 06:09.669
flour and eggs.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.305
It is a big risk to make ramen,

06:12.372 --> 06:15.375
because a noodle component
takes so much time.

06:15.441 --> 06:19.879
Once the dough is going,
I sauté my mushrooms with oil, salt,

06:19.946 --> 06:21.481
and a little bit of seasoning

06:21.547 --> 06:23.182
called sumac that was in my box.

06:23.249 --> 06:24.450
I've never used it before.

06:24.517 --> 06:25.651
It's lemony, sour.

06:27.687 --> 06:30.156
I don't know duck,
but I do know za'atar.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.858
I'm gonna spice things up a little bit.

06:31.924 --> 06:34.560
Za'atar is a Middle Eastern
Lebanese spice.

06:34.627 --> 06:35.728
I use this every day.

06:35.795 --> 06:37.997
I have a Lebanese background,
and that's kind of the way

06:38.064 --> 06:40.166
I like to cook as well.
It's very, very flavorful.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.935
A lot of garlic, a lot of lemon,
a lot of different spices.

06:43.636 --> 06:46.506
I've never cooked duck before.
I gotta make sure I don't mess it up.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.075
I need to make sure
this duck is not overcooked

06:49.142 --> 06:50.576
and definitely not undercooked.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.615
-Chef Gabe Kennedy!

06:55.681 --> 06:57.884
-Mr. Jordan Andino, how are you?
-What's up? How are you?

06:57.950 --> 06:59.719
-So good to see you.
-What are you working on?

06:59.786 --> 07:02.155
-We got some spicy bitter greens.
-Mm-hmm.

07:02.221 --> 07:04.624
You can prepare them
in a lot of different ways,

07:04.690 --> 07:06.426
fresh or cooked,
so we'll see what they do.

07:06.492 --> 07:08.928
I saw that in the Spend Box, there's duck.

07:08.995 --> 07:11.664
It's critical to render
all of the fat out, right?

07:11.731 --> 07:13.433
And get a nice, crispy skin.

07:13.499 --> 07:16.102
But in the Save Box,
you have boneless chicken thighs.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.303
The benefit of that box

07:17.370 --> 07:19.305
is the chicken thigh
gives you a lot of grace.

07:19.372 --> 07:22.074
It gives you a lot
of opportunity for error, right?

07:22.141 --> 07:23.009
-Yeah, true.
-Right.

07:23.075 --> 07:25.545
That Surprise Box. It's a whole chicken!

07:25.611 --> 07:27.547
Breaking down a whole chicken
can be intimidating,

07:27.613 --> 07:32.985
but it also provides a plethora
of opportunity to extract flavor,

07:33.052 --> 07:35.621
to incorporate bones into stock.

07:35.688 --> 07:38.124
-Or the-- the neck.
-Um, or depth of flavor. Neck.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.393
And overall, what are you expecting
from these home cooks?

07:40.460 --> 07:44.730
I'm looking for fun, and play,
and some whimsy, some creativity.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.299
-Hopefully, it tastes good too.
-Ooh!

07:46.365 --> 07:47.366
The bar is set!

07:47.433 --> 07:48.534
-All right.
-Later.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.608
I have chicken thighs
and cranberries.

07:55.675 --> 07:58.411
I'm thinking some sort
of stuffed chicken thigh

07:58.478 --> 08:01.280
with mushrooms and the cranberries.

08:01.347 --> 08:04.650
But when I opened up the rice pouch,
I'm immediately thinking,

08:04.717 --> 08:08.087
if my mom saw me cooking
pre-seasoned rice, she would say…

08:08.154 --> 08:11.290
"Absolutely not,
Taneisha. You better cook that thing up."

08:11.357 --> 08:15.595
So I'm going to make
chicken broth to add flavor to this rice.

08:15.661 --> 08:19.966
I come from a family
with amazing female cooks.

08:20.032 --> 08:23.102
I learned to cook watching my mother,
my grandmother, and my aunts.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.238
I have a Jamaican background.

08:25.304 --> 08:28.608
So I want to bring
in Caribbean island heat,

08:28.674 --> 08:31.077
vibrancy, and flair to this competition.

08:31.143 --> 08:37.316
So my dish desperately needs fresh herbs
or some greenery to tie it all together.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.123
Whoo!

08:44.190 --> 08:46.325
-The line is moving.
-About time.

08:46.392 --> 08:49.562
Red lights flashing.
Time to spend some money.

08:52.465 --> 08:55.668
Home cooks, first item up for auction is…

08:56.269 --> 08:58.838
Ooh, a nice little bundle of thyme.

08:58.905 --> 09:00.773
Gives you that freshness, herbaceous note.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.976
Works perfectly
with pretty much any poultry or foul.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.379
Fresh herbs
are always the way to go,

09:06.445 --> 09:08.314
a great way to add flavor.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.782
And I've spent very little money,

09:09.849 --> 09:12.218
so I know I have some
in the bank to spend.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.587
And I'm gonna start the bidding here low.

09:14.654 --> 09:17.490
-$700. Who has 700?
-700. 700.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.892
700 from Taneisha. Do I have 800?

09:20.626 --> 09:21.761
-Nope.
-Sold to Taneisha!

09:21.827 --> 09:24.664
-Sold to Taneisha!
-$700. Enjoy.

09:28.167 --> 09:31.304
All right, home cooks,
next item up for auction is…

09:31.370 --> 09:34.707
a trio of greens,
mustard greens, escarole, and endive.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.376
Keep it nice and light and fresh.
You want balance.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.111
We'll start it cheap, $600.

09:39.178 --> 09:40.279
-600.

09:40.346 --> 09:41.280
Do I have $700?

09:41.347 --> 09:42.448
-700.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.584
-No, Cindy.
-Do I have $1,000?

09:44.650 --> 09:46.252
-$1,000.
-$1,000 to Taneisha.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.889
I need these leafy greens.
I will stop at nothing to get them.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.891
-I'm doing it.
-Oh! $1,200 to Cindy.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.693
-$1,500.
-$1,500.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.561
Taneisha needs to keep it green.

09:55.628 --> 09:57.296
-$1,800.
-I'll take it.

09:57.363 --> 09:59.699
-Cindy's not giving up!
-$2,000. Cindy!

09:59.765 --> 10:01.601
-$2,000! Bring it, Cindy! Come at me!
-Cindy!

10:01.667 --> 10:03.135
$2,500!

10:03.202 --> 10:05.371
Taneisha, enough!
I need those greens.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.507
I need to add some color to my plate
and some vegetables to my ramen.

10:08.574 --> 10:09.909
-It's mine!

10:09.976 --> 10:11.777
-Let's go, Cindy! Come on!

10:11.844 --> 10:14.480
Cindy, girl, you don't know
how competitive I am.

10:14.547 --> 10:15.982
-$3,000.

10:16.048 --> 10:17.783
-$3,500!

10:17.850 --> 10:19.018
4,000!

10:19.085 --> 10:19.986
-4,000.

10:20.052 --> 10:22.521
-4,000 to Taneisha!
-Expensive greens.

10:22.588 --> 10:26.225
Oh, that's expensive greens.
$4,000 going once, going twice…

10:26.292 --> 10:27.259
-Sold!
-Oh!

10:27.326 --> 10:31.097
The most expensive greens in the history
of the world to Taneisha! Enjoy it.

10:31.163 --> 10:34.433
Four thousand bucks for the leafy greens?
What a rip-off.

10:35.835 --> 10:38.304
Taneisha, that cost you a bundle of green.

10:39.038 --> 10:40.539
It better work out.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.275
Home cooks, for your final auction item,

10:43.342 --> 10:45.144
guess what? You can't see it.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.712
It's a blind bid, but if you use this,

10:46.779 --> 10:49.849
it'll definitely help your dish.
Start the item off at $1,000.

10:49.915 --> 10:51.917
-$1,000. Roni's spending!

10:51.984 --> 10:53.853
-Do I hear $1,200? $1,200?

10:53.919 --> 10:55.554
-$1,500?

10:55.621 --> 10:57.923
-$1,500? $1,500 to Taneisha.
-1,500.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.091
-$1,800?

10:59.158 --> 11:00.626
$1,800 to Roni.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.028
-$2,000.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.696
Do I have $2,500?

11:03.763 --> 11:06.932
I need to be strategic
with what I spend my money on,

11:06.999 --> 11:08.968
but this blind bid caught my attention.

11:09.035 --> 11:11.037
I don't know what it is.
It could be something great.

11:11.103 --> 11:12.938
-Oh, $2,500 to Roni!

11:13.005 --> 11:14.340
-$2,800?

11:14.407 --> 11:15.408
Oh!

11:15.474 --> 11:18.844
$2,800 going once, going twice…

11:18.911 --> 11:22.014
Sold to Cindy, the mystery item.

11:22.081 --> 11:23.716
-And, Cindy, just so you know…
-Okay.

11:23.783 --> 11:24.784
You got…

11:25.584 --> 11:27.753
roasted chicken gravy and chicken tenders.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.223
Not what I was expecting.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.793
I already have chicken.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.394
Just not gonna work for my dish.

11:35.461 --> 11:37.229
-Good job, Cindy.
-Thanks.

11:37.296 --> 11:39.432
Home cooks, great spending.

11:39.498 --> 11:40.566
I like it.

11:45.104 --> 11:49.875
I paid $700 for thyme.
It's going to add some flavor to my rice.

11:51.177 --> 11:54.714
And then I'm using the mustard greens
with the mushrooms and the cranberries

11:54.780 --> 11:57.016
to create the stuffing
for the chicken thighs.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.985
I'm stuffing the chicken,
and then I'm gonna char it up in the oven.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.687
Then I'm gonna grill the endive.

12:01.754 --> 12:05.324
I could hear my mom saying to me,
"Come on, girl, you got it."

12:05.391 --> 12:10.062
But I look over, and I see
that Cindy's making her own noodles.

12:10.129 --> 12:13.999
If she's making noodles,
this is some amazing dish.

12:15.501 --> 12:17.803
I am behind, and I'm stressed.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.539
I'm still rolling my pasta,
which I still have to cook too.

12:21.607 --> 12:24.076
Twenty minutes left,
home cooks, 20 minutes.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.479
I'm super frazzled right now.

12:26.545 --> 12:27.847
I'm gonna die.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.348
Hopefully, it comes together.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.053
Hopefully, these won't take long to cook.

12:35.888 --> 12:39.024
I've always heard about duck fat,
so I wanna make sure that fat stands out,

12:39.091 --> 12:41.594
and I wanna make sure I use
that duck fat in something else.

12:41.660 --> 12:45.097
-Roni! Do you know what these are?
-Truffles, right?

12:45.164 --> 12:48.267
These are some of, like,
the best types of mushrooms you can have.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.335
-Right.
-Morels.

12:49.401 --> 12:51.203
-Morels.
-Yeah, it's a morel mushroom.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.439
-Treat them nicely and delicate.
-Okay.

12:53.506 --> 12:54.507
Take it as you will.

12:54.573 --> 12:57.109
These morels
are getting incorporated in my dish.

12:57.176 --> 13:01.380
I am sautéing them in the duck fat,
and then I see the sour cherries.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.984
I decide they're getting sautéed as well.
It's gonna be delicious as a topping.

13:07.319 --> 13:08.254
That's good.

13:09.221 --> 13:11.190
And then I love halloumi cheese.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.425
I wanna make this seared.
I wanna make it crispy.

13:13.492 --> 13:15.127
I batter it and fry it up.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.330
Chef Kennedy can wait.
I might just eat this myself.

13:18.397 --> 13:21.600
I'm gonna put it on the quinoa
and make a cheesy za'atar quinoa.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.838
Home cooks,
five minutes left! This is it.

13:25.905 --> 13:28.808
Make sure all your elements are done.
Start thinking about plating.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.511
I can't believe
I made noodles with the time I had.

13:32.578 --> 13:36.448
I'm just hoping that Chef Kennedy
will see that I thought outside the box.

13:39.752 --> 13:42.288
It's coming together.
It's coming together.

13:43.389 --> 13:45.157
I don't hate duck,
but I think I'm going to go

13:45.224 --> 13:47.326
over to Taneisha's
for some chicken thighs later.

13:50.362 --> 13:51.197
Oh!

13:51.263 --> 13:53.699
Home cooks, 90 seconds left, 90 seconds.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.735
-Cindy, are you plating yet?
-Yes.

13:56.802 --> 14:00.072
Your plates must be on the line,
and you have to hit your red button

14:00.139 --> 14:01.974
before time runs out.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.846
Get everything on the plate.

14:06.912 --> 14:09.181
Ahhh, my hands are shaking.

14:10.716 --> 14:12.251
-Ten, nine…

14:12.318 --> 14:16.055
-…eight, seven, six, five…

14:16.121 --> 14:18.557
…four, three, two…

14:18.624 --> 14:19.592
-…one.

14:20.092 --> 14:21.493
Good job.

14:23.395 --> 14:25.264
-You done did it.

14:26.465 --> 14:29.535
It's time to send those plates
down the line for Chef Kennedy.

14:30.169 --> 14:33.906
Chef Kennedy's about to judge
my food, and I am nervous.

14:36.075 --> 14:37.743
I paid a whole lot of money,

14:37.810 --> 14:41.046
so this dish, it better taste great.

14:43.415 --> 14:44.650
-How you feeling?
-I'm ready.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.952
All right, so here in front of you,

14:47.019 --> 14:52.024
you have a chicken ramen
with lion's mane mushroom.

14:52.091 --> 14:55.427
Mmm! Clearly,
the home cook made their own noodles.

14:55.494 --> 14:57.096
I'm gonna just start by…

14:57.162 --> 15:00.165
…tasting the broth,
which actually is quite flavorful.

15:01.433 --> 15:02.468
Chicken comes through.

15:02.534 --> 15:04.436
I appreciate the creativity

15:04.503 --> 15:07.206
of incorporating some sumac
into the lion's mane.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.041
Lion's mane is such a beautiful mushroom.

15:09.108 --> 15:11.944
It's like a sponge,
so it really is quite flavorful.

15:12.511 --> 15:14.546
This is gonna be
a really fun thing to do.

15:14.613 --> 15:15.915
-Hang on.

15:17.149 --> 15:19.718
The noodles are cooked well,
maybe a little bit under for me.

15:19.785 --> 15:21.353
A touch more chew than I'd like.

15:21.420 --> 15:25.624
But the cook decided
to make a soup, noodles, all in an hour.

15:25.691 --> 15:27.526
I think this is a very bold preparation.

15:29.728 --> 15:32.197
This one
is a pan-seared duck breast

15:32.264 --> 15:34.033
with a za'atar quinoa,

15:34.099 --> 15:36.135
topped with sour cherries and morels.

15:36.201 --> 15:39.104
All right. The duck looks
like it's cooked really well.

15:39.171 --> 15:41.407
-This is exactly how I like duck cooked.
-Perfect.

15:41.473 --> 15:43.008
The execution is-- is great.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.377
Well, it looks good. How does it taste?

15:45.444 --> 15:47.947
This is a really tender piece
of duck breast.

15:49.515 --> 15:53.552
I'm picking up a little bit of seasoning
on the skin, perhaps the za'atar.

15:55.521 --> 15:57.990
Morels, really earthy and rich in flavor.

15:58.057 --> 15:58.958
Mm-hmm.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.559
Fair amount of duck fat in there too.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.361
-That's good.
-Um, which I like.

16:02.428 --> 16:06.065
Quinoa is well cooked,
but this quinoa is asking for sauce.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.900
-Yeah.
-This duck is asking for sauce.

16:07.967 --> 16:11.070
But if I sat down at anyone's home,
and they served this to me,

16:11.136 --> 16:13.005
I would be an absolute happy camper.

16:14.573 --> 16:17.676
This in front of you
is a stuffed chicken thigh

16:17.743 --> 16:20.479
on a bed of chicken broth
and herb-infused rice,

16:20.546 --> 16:21.780
with a grilled endive.

16:21.847 --> 16:25.584
Wow, okay.
I actually really love this presentation.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.088
See some fresh herb and thyme.
It-- It's a really great color contrast.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.257
This is the kind of dish
where I wanna, like, get in there.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.792
-Dive in.
-Right, here we go.

16:36.128 --> 16:36.996
Yum.

16:37.062 --> 16:38.530
-Yum's good.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

16:38.597 --> 16:41.533
This rice is very flavorful.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.703
They must have done something
to take it to the next level.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.672
It was not just out of the box.

16:46.739 --> 16:50.976
This home cook purchased
a fresh bundle of thyme for $700.

16:51.043 --> 16:53.912
I did taste the thyme in the rice.

16:53.979 --> 16:55.147
-Which works well.
-Okay.

16:55.214 --> 16:58.117
The chicken is really well seasoned,
really well cooked.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.718
This home cook purchased

16:59.785 --> 17:03.022
the endive, the mustard greens,
and escarole for $4,000.

17:03.088 --> 17:04.023
Ooh!

17:04.089 --> 17:07.426
The endive and the mustard green
makes it a lot more interesting.

17:07.493 --> 17:10.729
The element that I would add to this dish
is some high, bright note

17:10.796 --> 17:12.097
to really round it out.

17:13.499 --> 17:14.900
Chef, you've tried all three dishes.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.835
-Do you think you have your winner?
-I do.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.108
You ready?

17:23.175 --> 17:24.376
-We're ready.
-Let's do it.

17:24.443 --> 17:26.512
-Got some results for you.
-All right!

17:27.046 --> 17:30.849
The home cook
with the best out-of-the-box dish is…

17:35.120 --> 17:36.588
You're killing me!

17:36.655 --> 17:37.823
Right?

17:37.890 --> 17:39.892
-Taneisha!
-Whoo!

17:41.326 --> 17:43.028
I did it!

17:43.095 --> 17:45.831
I am so excited
that I had the winning dish.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.800
-I feel so confident.

17:47.866 --> 17:51.437
And I have $17,800 left.

17:51.503 --> 17:53.705
Right!

17:54.206 --> 17:56.608
Let's go!

17:56.675 --> 18:01.013
For the final round, you'll be celebrating
one of Chef Kennedy's favorite meals.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.715
It's a meal of leisure,
a meal of indulgence,

18:03.782 --> 18:05.451
and a meal to share with friends.

18:05.517 --> 18:07.886
The Chef's choice is out to brunch.

18:09.154 --> 18:12.925
Right now, Chef Kennedy is preparing
your brunch-inspired ingredient boxes.

18:12.991 --> 18:15.761
I'm a brunch guy.
I know all the best brunch spots.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.464
I did not come to lose.
So let's play this game.

18:18.530 --> 18:19.932
Rise and shine, home cooks.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.568
Chef Kennedy, let's do some brunch.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.411
In this round,
the boxes have a set price.

18:34.079 --> 18:37.282
The Spend Box is gonna cost you $8,000.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.485
The Save Box, $4,000.

18:39.551 --> 18:42.187
And the Surprise Box, $6,000.

18:42.254 --> 18:44.323
Taneisha, because you won the first round,

18:44.389 --> 18:47.793
you've earned the power to choose
what box you'd like to work with,

18:47.860 --> 18:51.363
and assign the other boxes
to your fellow home cooks.

18:53.499 --> 18:54.733
Oh!

18:54.800 --> 18:56.101
Wha--

18:56.168 --> 18:57.603
I love this.

18:57.669 --> 18:59.505
Taneisha, which box would you like to buy?

18:59.571 --> 19:03.542
I'm going to stick to what worked
in the beginning. So I'll do Save.

19:03.609 --> 19:06.111
The Save Box will cost you $4,000.

19:06.678 --> 19:08.881
Who would you like
to assign the Spend Box to,

19:08.947 --> 19:11.717
along with its price tag of eight grand?

19:14.686 --> 19:15.854
It's all about Roni.

19:18.056 --> 19:21.426
Roni has the most money.
Let me knock that down a little bit.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.429
She assigns me that box,
the most expensive box,

19:24.496 --> 19:25.898
and she's draining my bank account.

19:25.964 --> 19:28.800
But my sense of competition
is in overdrive.

19:28.867 --> 19:30.202
I cannot lose.

19:30.269 --> 19:34.173
Which means, Cindy, you've been assigned
the Surprise Box for $6,000.

19:35.274 --> 19:38.410
The cook with the best brunch
wins all the cash in their bank.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.015
You have 45 minutes on the clock,

19:43.081 --> 19:45.350
and the time has come again

19:45.417 --> 19:47.486
to cook at all costs. Go!

19:55.227 --> 19:59.965
I open that Spend Box, and I think,
"This box better be good for $8,000."

20:00.032 --> 20:01.700
Duck eggs.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.869
Lobster. Oh, God.

20:04.503 --> 20:06.972
Caviar is not on my grocery list,
I'll tell you that.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.209
Who is having
lobster and caviar for brunch?

20:10.275 --> 20:12.244
And why aren't they ever inviting me over?

20:12.311 --> 20:15.380
You know, I've never cooked
a lobster before.

20:15.447 --> 20:17.649
I'm not used to cooking
with these rich ingredients.

20:17.716 --> 20:18.717
What am I gonna do now?

20:18.784 --> 20:21.320
I think I might've been better off
with the cheap brunch.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.089
Roni, how's your $8,000 box?

20:24.156 --> 20:25.657
You can ask the lobster.

20:25.724 --> 20:29.228
-Oh! Stop this right now!
-Ooh!

20:29.294 --> 20:30.963
How's your penny-pinching box?

20:31.029 --> 20:32.564
When I win, I'll tell you.

20:32.631 --> 20:33.765
Ooh!

20:34.700 --> 20:38.370
I know that Roni is thrown off,
so mission accomplished.

20:38.937 --> 20:40.672
I open up that Save Box.

20:40.739 --> 20:44.710
I've got chicken eggs, sushi roe,
spinach, and the cottage cheese.

20:44.776 --> 20:45.944
And then I see…

20:46.011 --> 20:47.312
White perch?

20:48.280 --> 20:49.815
What the hell is-- Jesus.

20:49.881 --> 20:53.352
I know absolutely nothing
about white perch.

20:53.986 --> 20:56.355
This box… whew.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.057
What am I gonna do
with all these ingredients?

20:59.691 --> 21:01.593
We'll see where I go with it.

21:03.061 --> 21:04.796
Ooh, what's this? Smoked salmon.

21:05.364 --> 21:06.531
Mascarpone.

21:07.132 --> 21:09.001
Oh, onions. Bread.

21:09.668 --> 21:11.837
I actually did not want the Surprise Box.

21:11.903 --> 21:14.473
I see the salmon roe,
I see the smoked salmon,

21:14.539 --> 21:15.907
and then I see the ball.

21:16.842 --> 21:19.911
What is this?
I really don't know what this is.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.281
Coconut?

21:23.482 --> 21:25.350
Cindy, that's an ostrich egg.

21:26.318 --> 21:29.554
An ostrich egg?
I didn't even know what it was.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.157
Oh my gosh.
So embarrassing.

21:32.224 --> 21:33.692
That's 24 eggs in one.

21:33.759 --> 21:35.294
Oh, wow.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.262
I've never seen an ostrich egg.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.164
I don't even know
how to break into that thing.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.236
Of course brunch has some eggs,
but we've also got seafood.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.606
Taneisha's Save Box has
some chicken eggs and white perch.

21:47.673 --> 21:51.576
Roni's Spend Box has duck eggs
and lobster. Getting fancy.

21:51.643 --> 21:56.081
And Cindy's Surprise Box has smoked salmon
and the world's biggest egg.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.049
Good luck, home cooks.

21:57.749 --> 22:00.552
When I think of brunch,
I immediately think of dim sum,

22:00.619 --> 22:01.953
but then I have the ostrich egg.

22:02.020 --> 22:05.891
So, do I make an omelet with the egg,
or do I stick to my roots?

22:05.957 --> 22:08.160
To dim sum or not to dim sum?

22:08.226 --> 22:09.261
That is the question.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.530
Taneisha, you gave me a really hard box.

22:11.596 --> 22:12.931
-I did?
-You did.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.266
No refunds.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.001
Taneisha forced my hand

22:16.068 --> 22:17.969
and spent a lot of my money
on these ingredients.

22:18.036 --> 22:21.573
I'm not letting anything go to waste.
The bread, I'm sure I can use.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.309
The garlic aioli,
I could eat that with a spoon.

22:24.376 --> 22:28.747
And I'm an omelet guy, so I'm making
an omelet sandwich with aioli.

22:28.814 --> 22:31.483
I wanted to make sure those figs
are highlighted, figs aren't cheap.

22:31.550 --> 22:34.086
So I'm making a salad,
but I want to figure out

22:34.152 --> 22:36.221
how to incorporate the lobster.

22:36.288 --> 22:38.690
That's gotta be the main ingredient.
It needs to stand out.

22:38.757 --> 22:43.528
Taneisha, she does not want me to win,
but I'm here to crush the competition.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.064
I know
I've got the budget ingredients,

22:46.131 --> 22:47.833
but I start pumping myself up.

22:47.899 --> 22:49.234
I am going to make it work.

22:49.835 --> 22:50.902
Okay.

22:50.969 --> 22:52.537
I'm not familiar with white perch.

22:52.604 --> 22:55.774
However, I'm more familiar with a catfish.

22:55.841 --> 22:59.478
So I'm going to apply
the same technique to the white perch.

22:59.544 --> 23:04.983
Add flour, egg wash, breadcrumbs.
I dip, dip, dip, and I fry it up.

23:08.620 --> 23:09.721
Whoa!

23:09.788 --> 23:11.390
Those ingredient boxes?

23:11.456 --> 23:12.991
-Wow! Wow.
-You can say that again.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.927
Uh, Chef Gabe,
let's talk about these boxes.

23:15.994 --> 23:17.929
In the Save Box,
we have, you know, regular eggs,

23:17.996 --> 23:20.332
we have salmon roe,
and then you have a white fish, perch.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.969
It's a challenge, and there's going
to need to be a direction that's picked.

23:24.035 --> 23:26.838
The Spend Box,
that's an opulent, bougie brunch.

23:26.905 --> 23:27.939
Yeah.

23:28.006 --> 23:29.908
And then the Surprise Box, an ostrich egg.

23:29.975 --> 23:31.510
It's intimidating for sure.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.012
-It's the biggest egg in the world.
-It literally is.

23:34.079 --> 23:37.082
That thing is impressive,
and if we forgo the ostrich egg,

23:37.149 --> 23:38.483
I'm gonna be a bit disappointed.

23:38.550 --> 23:42.421
Brunch is about challenging the norms
and breaking the usual pattern.

23:42.487 --> 23:46.057
I want the home cooks
to really think outside the box.

23:46.124 --> 23:48.193
Good seeing you.
I'm gonna go check on the home cooks.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.494
-All right.
-Later.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.169
Oh, I still don't know
what I'm doing yet.

23:57.235 --> 23:58.904
I don't even know how to break this.

23:58.970 --> 24:01.039
I don't know what to do
with this ostrich egg.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.575
So now I'm going full-force into dim sum.

24:03.642 --> 24:06.645
I'm saying bye-bye to my ostrich egg.

24:06.711 --> 24:09.181
Sunday mornings are the days
that-- when I make dim sum.

24:09.247 --> 24:10.715
My kids love it, my family loves it.

24:10.782 --> 24:14.252
So I'm making the dough
for my shumai dumplings.

24:14.319 --> 24:18.490
Shumai is a type of Chinese dumpling
served at dim sum.

24:18.557 --> 24:21.326
Traditionally, shumai is made
with ground pork,

24:21.393 --> 24:23.094
but I have a smoked salmon.

24:23.161 --> 24:24.896
I have no idea
if this is gonna work or not.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.965
You never know
what's gonna come down that line.

24:36.508 --> 24:39.277
And the first item up for bid is…

24:39.344 --> 24:41.780
thick-cut bacon.

24:41.847 --> 24:44.249
I'm gonna start the bid at $1,000.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.650
-Bacon for me!

24:45.717 --> 24:48.487
$1,000 to Cindy for bacon.
Do I hear $1,200?

24:48.553 --> 24:51.289
$1,000 going once, going twice…

24:51.356 --> 24:53.725
Sold to Cindy for $1,000.

24:54.226 --> 24:57.762
Now that I have this bacon,
I'll use it to flavor my shumai.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.701
Next item,
peeled and diced potatoes.

25:02.767 --> 25:06.705
There's no such thing as brunch
without home fries. I've got $14,000 left.

25:06.771 --> 25:08.640
I'm prepared to go all the way.

25:08.707 --> 25:11.243
I'm gonna start the bid at $800.

25:11.309 --> 25:12.644
-800.

25:12.711 --> 25:14.746
-$1,000 to Roni.

25:14.813 --> 25:16.848
I got a bidding war. Do I hear $1,200?

25:16.915 --> 25:18.216
-1,200.

25:18.283 --> 25:21.586
-$1,500! Roni, that's what I like to see!

25:21.653 --> 25:22.554
-1,800.

25:22.621 --> 25:25.090
-Do I hear $2,000?

25:25.156 --> 25:26.858
I've got more money
than you now, Taneisha.

25:26.925 --> 25:28.326
I'll empty this whole bank account.

25:28.393 --> 25:29.761
-25.

25:29.828 --> 25:31.897
-$3,000! Roni!

25:31.963 --> 25:33.164
-3,500.

25:33.231 --> 25:34.933
-Do I hear $4,000?
-Let's go, Roni.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.068
-You want them potatoes?
-I want the potatoes, yeah.

25:37.135 --> 25:39.137
-I need the potatoes.
-Do I hear 5,000?

25:39.204 --> 25:40.805
-$5,000.
-$5,000.

25:40.872 --> 25:44.776
At this point, I'm just wanting him
to spend money, 'cause I know he's cheap.

25:45.911 --> 25:48.246
$6,000. $6,000 going once…

25:48.313 --> 25:49.514
Yeah, you-- They're yours.

25:49.581 --> 25:50.882
-Are you out of money?

25:50.949 --> 25:52.384
Sold to Roni!

25:52.450 --> 25:56.821
Wow, Roni! That's like literally $1,000
a cube in there, you big spender.

25:56.888 --> 26:00.892
I did not think I was gonna spend
$6,000 on those potatoes,

26:00.959 --> 26:02.694
but, you know, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

26:02.761 --> 26:04.629
So let's make some home fries.

26:04.696 --> 26:09.000
This next auction item,
five different delicious mushrooms,

26:09.067 --> 26:10.969
the umami of the vegetable world.

26:11.036 --> 26:12.737
We'll start the bid at $1,000.

26:12.804 --> 26:14.205
Do I have $1,000?

26:15.574 --> 26:17.676
$1,000 going once. Going twice…

26:17.742 --> 26:21.046
No one's bidding on these mushrooms,
so I'm buying them.

26:22.013 --> 26:24.916
Sold to Cindy for $1,000.

26:24.983 --> 26:28.453
Mushrooms will add
a depth of flavor to my dumplings.

26:28.954 --> 26:32.490
Now that I have my auction buys,
I don't need a smoked salmon anymore.

26:32.557 --> 26:34.125
I'm chopping up my bacon.

26:34.192 --> 26:37.696
And with the bacon fat,
I am adding mushrooms to it,

26:37.762 --> 26:39.230
sautéing it into the fat,

26:39.297 --> 26:42.400
and then I'm going to take the filling
to stuff into my dumplings.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.606
I have never cooked
lobster in my life.

26:47.672 --> 26:50.842
I'm used to making omelets with ham,
and peppers, and simple ingredients.

26:50.909 --> 26:52.711
First thing I'm trying to figure out is

26:52.777 --> 26:54.679
which part of the lobster
has the meat in it.

26:54.746 --> 26:56.581
Everybody's always talking
about lobster tail,

26:56.648 --> 26:58.316
I'm like, "That's what I've always had."

26:58.383 --> 27:00.518
Once I've got the meat out,
I start my omelet.

27:00.585 --> 27:02.520
When I put everything into that pan,

27:02.587 --> 27:05.156
I realize that that lobster
might be too heavy,

27:05.223 --> 27:07.359
and I'm not gonna be able
to flip this gracefully.

27:08.693 --> 27:09.828
Not good.

27:11.429 --> 27:13.965
Maybe it's time
to put it in the oven as a frittata.

27:16.101 --> 27:17.302
To go with my perch,

27:17.369 --> 27:20.105
I wanna add a fresh spinach salad
with poached eggs.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.107
Oh, come on.

27:22.173 --> 27:25.043
I'm trying to poach these eggs.
It's not coming together.

27:26.344 --> 27:30.015
I've made poached eggs before.
However, clearly, I'm not a pro.

27:30.081 --> 27:31.850
Poached eggs, trash.

27:31.916 --> 27:35.253
This is the most stressful brunch
I have ever made.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.388
Okay.

27:36.454 --> 27:39.190
So I'm switching gears.
Sunny-side eggs it is.

27:46.231 --> 27:49.034
Home cooks, the line is moving!

27:49.100 --> 27:51.236
Red light flashing! Auction happening!

27:53.872 --> 27:58.076
The winner of this auction will receive
whatever is under the big cloche

27:58.143 --> 27:59.878
or the mini cloche.

27:59.944 --> 28:00.912
That'll be your choice.

28:00.979 --> 28:03.048
The opening bid is $500.

28:03.114 --> 28:04.416
-$500.

28:05.383 --> 28:06.818
Oh! $600 to Roni.

28:06.885 --> 28:07.952
Do I have $800?

28:08.520 --> 28:09.754
-$800.

28:09.821 --> 28:12.023
-$1,000. There you go, Roni.

28:12.090 --> 28:15.460
You know, I love a surprise.
I cannot resist the unknown.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.496
$1,000 going once, going twice…

28:18.563 --> 28:21.166
Sold to Roni for $1,000.

28:21.232 --> 28:22.133
Great. Okay.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.135
The big cloche or the small cloche?

28:24.202 --> 28:25.370
The small cloche.

28:25.437 --> 28:26.471
Let's find out.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.407
Money!

28:29.474 --> 28:30.508
Nice.

28:30.575 --> 28:34.412
Roni, that is $3,000 back into your bank.

28:34.479 --> 28:35.346
-Sweet.
-Yeah.

28:35.413 --> 28:37.248
Wait, how's--
I spent, like, nothing on that.

28:37.315 --> 28:38.349
That's a good deal.

28:38.416 --> 28:41.720
I spent $1,000 and made three.
That's a good investment.

28:41.786 --> 28:44.789
For fun, let's just have a look
at what was underneath the big cloche.

28:44.856 --> 28:46.925
Berries.

28:46.991 --> 28:49.861
Berries are expensive, Jordan.
That could've been a good deal either way.

28:49.928 --> 28:52.197
-That's the banker in you.

28:54.799 --> 28:55.734
Oh my gosh.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.235
There's only six minutes left.

28:57.302 --> 29:00.205
Dumplings take
exactly six minutes to steam.

29:00.271 --> 29:03.341
I am super stressed out.
I don't think they're gonna cook in time.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.443
Gonna start steaming this first.

29:06.010 --> 29:08.446
How're you doing, Roni?
Oh, my gosh, you're plating already!

29:08.513 --> 29:09.914
It's almost time.

29:09.981 --> 29:14.185
I've got both layers with garlic aioli.
I've got some caviar in there.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.121
But at the very last minute,

29:16.187 --> 29:19.924
I decide that I'm going to grill
the finished lobster sandwich in butter

29:19.991 --> 29:21.926
and really try to up that flavor.

29:21.993 --> 29:24.028
-Just for a minute.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.732
Two minutes left, home cooks!
Come on, you can do this!

29:27.799 --> 29:28.733
No.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.870
The time is going to run out.
I can hear my mom in the back of my head,

29:31.936 --> 29:34.205
saying, "Come on, girl. Keep it on time."

29:34.272 --> 29:37.208
So I've got to send
the spinach out undressed.

29:37.275 --> 29:40.178
I'm worried
because there's no transformation.

29:40.245 --> 29:41.646
It's just spinach.

29:42.947 --> 29:43.948
Forty seconds.

29:44.516 --> 29:47.418
Oh my gosh. My wrappers are still raw.

29:47.485 --> 29:48.787
I look at the dim sum,

29:48.853 --> 29:51.289
and I'm really worried
that they're not cooked.

29:53.057 --> 29:54.425
Home cooks, as a reminder,

29:54.492 --> 29:56.795
you need to get your dish on the line
and hit the red button

29:56.861 --> 29:58.530
before time runs out.

30:00.765 --> 30:02.801
-Five, four…

30:02.867 --> 30:05.103
…three, two…

30:05.170 --> 30:06.271
-…one.

30:06.337 --> 30:10.575
Yo, Roni! Time's up, home cooks!

30:15.046 --> 30:17.549
Your dishes are off to final judgment.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.627
That was intense. I can't wait
to see what you think of these dishes.

30:29.694 --> 30:31.830
Oh, I'm excited.
I'm chomping at the bit over here.

30:31.896 --> 30:35.500
Your first dish is
a bacon-and-mushroom shumai dumpling

30:35.567 --> 30:38.236
with a side salad and pickled onions.

30:38.303 --> 30:40.205
At first glance, beautiful.

30:43.374 --> 30:45.777
-Wow.
-I'm on the edge of my seat here.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.179
I went through a flavor journey.

30:49.147 --> 30:52.784
At first, I was hit
with that fatty, umami, bacon bliss.

30:52.851 --> 30:53.685
Mm-hmm.

30:53.751 --> 30:56.221
All the meanwhile,
I'm getting a slight crunch and pop

30:56.287 --> 30:57.555
from the mushroom.

30:57.622 --> 31:01.059
Unfortunately, this wrapper is uncooked.

31:02.493 --> 31:04.896
So I was really excited
for the ostrich egg,

31:04.963 --> 31:07.398
and I'm a bit bummed
that it didn't show up on the plate.

31:07.465 --> 31:09.133
It could have been used

31:09.200 --> 31:12.503
as another ingredient
in the filling of a shumai.

31:13.805 --> 31:17.675
Here we have a lobster omelet sandwich

31:17.742 --> 31:20.178
with aioli, home fries, and a fig salad.

31:20.245 --> 31:22.513
I'm seeing some caviar hidden in here.

31:22.580 --> 31:24.249
-Yeah! Caviar!
-I mean, whoa!

31:24.315 --> 31:26.351
That's some luxury.
This is an expensive sandwich.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.523
This is a full-on decadent sandwich.

31:32.590 --> 31:34.092
I mean, it's really good.

31:35.260 --> 31:36.828
It's packed with lobster.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.264
-The duck egg is so flavorful.
-Mm-hmm.

31:39.330 --> 31:40.598
It's well-seasoned.

31:40.665 --> 31:43.701
The aioli is giving
that kind of fat content

31:43.768 --> 31:46.738
that is expected
in an indulgent sandwich like this.

31:46.804 --> 31:49.841
This home cook purchased
those potatoes for $6,000.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.009
Oof!

31:51.075 --> 31:52.110
Totally not necessary.

31:52.176 --> 31:53.912
I don't know how much this is adding

31:53.978 --> 31:57.315
other than this is what is expected
to eat with brunch, right?

31:58.483 --> 32:02.720
Here, we have fried white perch
with a brown-butter egg, and greens.

32:02.787 --> 32:03.721
Wow!

32:08.326 --> 32:11.429
I'm really impressed
by the preparation of this fish.

32:11.496 --> 32:16.701
Perch, well cooked, great crust,
evenly breaded, still crispy.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.202
-Seasoned very well.
-Okay.

32:18.269 --> 32:20.705
Kind of flaking apart
in my mouth as I'm eating it.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.006
So A-plus on the fish.

32:23.408 --> 32:25.143
Now this is just uninspiring to me.

32:25.209 --> 32:27.378
There's no seasoning,
there's no olive oil, no salt.

32:27.445 --> 32:29.814
There's nothing transformative
about this, it's spinach,

32:29.881 --> 32:32.150
and it feels like an afterthought.

32:32.717 --> 32:37.088
The egg was a nice complement,
brown butter and lots of flavor.

32:37.155 --> 32:43.695
Overall, this was a very good preparation
of a really, really challenging box.

32:45.330 --> 32:47.532
You've now tried all of the dishes.

32:47.598 --> 32:49.767
Seems like a tough one,
but think you can name a winner?

32:49.834 --> 32:51.069
-I got it, Jordan.
-All right.

32:57.475 --> 33:00.411
Home cooks, it's time to find out
who won the competition

33:00.478 --> 33:02.313
along with all that cash in their bank.

33:03.214 --> 33:04.749
But first, please allow me

33:04.816 --> 33:07.852
to introduce you
to our guest chef and judge,

33:07.919 --> 33:09.454
Chef Gabe Kennedy.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.559
Hello, home cooks.

33:14.625 --> 33:16.227
-Hello.
-Hi!

33:16.294 --> 33:18.196
All right, let's get to the results.

33:20.465 --> 33:23.368
Which home cook made
the bacon-mushroom shumai?

33:24.702 --> 33:27.905
Cindy, the dim sum was creative,
the flavors were great,

33:27.972 --> 33:30.742
but I was very disappointed
that you didn't use the ostrich egg.

33:30.808 --> 33:31.676
Okay.

33:32.210 --> 33:34.545
And who made the lobster omelet sandwich?

33:35.046 --> 33:39.283
So, the lobster sandwich
was decadent and wildly flavorful.

33:39.350 --> 33:42.153
However, the potatoes
didn't really add much to the plate.

33:44.856 --> 33:49.060
Taneisha, so the perch was flaky
and very well fried,

33:49.127 --> 33:52.296
but I do wish you did a bit more
to transform the spinach.

33:54.332 --> 33:57.735
Cindy, you have $11,200
remaining in your bank.

33:58.569 --> 34:01.039
Roni, you have $10,000,

34:01.639 --> 34:06.177
and Taneisha, you have
the largest amount with $13,800.

34:07.011 --> 34:10.381
Only one of you can be the best in brunch
and win the competition.

34:11.482 --> 34:13.751
The home cook with the best dish

34:13.818 --> 34:17.321
who proved
that they could cook at all costs is…

34:21.759 --> 34:22.660
Roni!

34:23.561 --> 34:24.929
-What?

34:24.996 --> 34:26.164
-Yay!
-Amazing!

34:27.398 --> 34:28.599
That's great!

34:28.666 --> 34:32.437
I'm shocked. I am the winner.
I'm a better cook than I thought.

34:32.503 --> 34:36.908
Roni, congratulations. You've won
all $10,000 remaining in your bank.

34:36.974 --> 34:39.143
-Wow! Great!

34:39.210 --> 34:41.846
I am so proud
of what I did with the time I had.

34:41.913 --> 34:45.416
My biggest takeaway from this
is just to have fun.

34:45.483 --> 34:48.052
Food is fun, and I had a blast.

34:48.119 --> 34:50.688
I had
an amazing experience today.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.424
I learned that having fun is the best way

34:53.491 --> 34:56.294
to allow your creativity
to shine in the kitchen.

34:56.861 --> 34:58.729
I'm $10,000 richer.

34:58.796 --> 35:00.531
There is no chance
I'm spending this money.

35:00.598 --> 35:02.467
I'm gonna save, and I'm gonna invest.

35:02.533 --> 35:03.835
Good job!
