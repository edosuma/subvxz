WEBVTT

01:23.792 --> 01:25.126
Pew, pew.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.420
Pew.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.673
We have to do this every hour?

02:53.756 --> 02:55.341
Gas breaks down over time.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.968
This stuff's almost water.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.680
Back in the day,
we'd drive 10, 12 hours on one tank.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.308
- You could go anywhere.
- So where'd you go?

03:04.726 --> 03:05.894
Pretty much nowhere.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.899
Nice! How does that work?

03:10.982 --> 03:12.317
It's a siphon.

03:13.735 --> 03:17.488
It's when liquid
travels against gravity

03:17.572 --> 03:19.073
- because pressure--
- You don't know.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.950
I know it works.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.368
No wandering.

03:31.836 --> 03:32.754
Okay.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.924
This is your fault then.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.722
"It doesn't matter how much you push
the envelope,

03:42.805 --> 03:44.933
it'll still be stationery."

03:46.809 --> 03:47.810
"No Pun Intended,

03:47.894 --> 03:49.979
Volume Too" by Will Livingston.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.440
"Volume Too." Look. You get it?

03:52.523 --> 03:54.108
- "Too"? Like, T-o-o.
- Jesus.

03:55.234 --> 03:57.403
"What did the mermaid
wear to her math class?"

04:01.532 --> 04:03.076
"An algae bra."

04:03.409 --> 04:05.954
Like, algae bra.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.665
- "I stayed up all night--
- No.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.833
"wondering where the sun went,

04:10.917 --> 04:12.460
and then it dawned on me."

04:12.543 --> 04:15.338
- Feel free to wait in the truck.
- Okay,

04:15.421 --> 04:18.716
but just know,
you can't escape Will Livingston.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.717
He'll be back.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.178
There's nothing you can do to stop him.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.152
Must've been some truck.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.904
Yeah, they used to stick
big-ass plows on them,

04:39.988 --> 04:42.031
and clear the roads
for their tanks and such.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.783
I wanna see a tank.

04:43.866 --> 04:44.993
You will.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.579
Tanks, choppers, all that stuff.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.624
But they'll fight the wrong enemy.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.459
Just scattered around now.

04:56.671 --> 04:57.755
I got somethin'.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.591
Here.
This make you all nostalgic?

05:02.593 --> 05:04.721
This is actually before my time.

05:05.179 --> 05:07.724
- Great.
- It's a winner, though.

05:15.648 --> 05:16.524
Oh, man.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.193
Got somethin' else.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.573
It's light on the reading,

05:23.656 --> 05:26.868
- but it has some interesting pictures.
- No, no, no. Put that back.

05:26.951 --> 05:27.827
That's not for kids. Ellie.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.495
How would he even walk around
with that thing?

05:29.579 --> 05:31.247
- Please get rid of it.
- Hold your horses.

05:31.330 --> 05:33.166
I wanna see what all the fuss is about.

05:37.211 --> 05:38.755
Why are all these pages stuck together?

05:41.382 --> 05:42.258
The--

05:42.341 --> 05:44.177
I’m just fuckin' with ya.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.307
Bye-bye, dude!

06:59.293 --> 07:01.420
All right.
That's enough for today.

07:44.463 --> 07:46.382
- Slow down.
- This is slow.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.135
What am I even eating?

07:49.218 --> 07:52.013
That is 20-year-old
Chef Boyardee ravioli.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.473
- That guy was good.
- I actually agree.

08:00.354 --> 08:01.939
How long we staying out here?

08:02.023 --> 08:03.774
I figure I sleep tonight,

08:03.858 --> 08:06.319
and drive tomorrow all day, all night,

08:06.402 --> 08:08.279
get us to Wyoming by next mornin'.

08:08.362 --> 08:10.072
So can we start a fire?
I'm freezing.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.741
Now, why am I gonna tell you no?

08:12.450 --> 08:13.826
Because Infected will see the smoke.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.828
No. Fungus isn't that smart.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.623
This is too remote for Infected, anyway.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.209
People?

08:24.420 --> 08:26.214
So what are they gonna do?
Rob us?

08:26.297 --> 08:28.132
They'll have
way more in mind than that.

08:31.969 --> 08:32.887
Okay.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.106
Actually smells kinda good.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.943
Well, that would be Frank's then.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.070
Joel.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.160
- Joel.
- What?

09:39.245 --> 09:41.789
- Can I ask you a serious question?
- Yeah.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.714
"Why did the scarecrow get an award?"

09:55.803 --> 09:57.972
Because he was outstanding in his field.

09:58.055 --> 10:00.516
You dick!

10:00.599 --> 10:02.518
- Did you read this?
- No.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.895
Now go to sleep.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.961
Those people you said,

10:30.671 --> 10:33.215
there's no way anyone
knows we're here, right?

10:34.467 --> 10:36.010
No one's gonna find us.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.389
No one's gonna find us.

10:46.645 --> 10:47.813
Okay.

11:49.875 --> 11:53.421
- What the fuck is that?
- You don't like coffee?

12:11.772 --> 12:14.733
Is that seriously what those Starbucks
in the QZ used to sell?

12:16.193 --> 12:17.987
Well, theirs was a lot fresher
than what Bill saved up,

12:18.070 --> 12:19.989
but, yeah, this is what they sold.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.784
Smells like burnt shit.

12:30.374 --> 12:31.500
Eyes on the map.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.881
76 west and then,

12:36.964 --> 12:40.801
70 west for, like, ever.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.095
Where in Wyoming
did you say your brother was?

12:43.512 --> 12:46.599
Last contact came through a radio tower
close to Cody.

12:46.682 --> 12:47.933
Cody.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.854
Cody, Cody. Ah, man.
That is deep up in there.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.856
- Yeah.
- And if he's not there?

12:54.648 --> 12:57.610
Then odds are he'll be near a settlement,

12:57.693 --> 12:59.069
probably close to another city out there.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.654
Ain't too many of 'em in Wyoming.

13:00.738 --> 13:01.864
Chee-Yen.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.366
- Cheyenne.
- Che-- really?

13:04.867 --> 13:07.620
Cheyenne, Laramie,

13:08.454 --> 13:09.788
Casper?

13:10.372 --> 13:11.540
What's his name?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.542
- Whose name?
- Your brother.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.211
- Tommy.
- Younger or older?

13:15.294 --> 13:17.254
- Younger.
- Why isn't he with you?

13:17.338 --> 13:19.715
- A long story.
- Is it longer than 25 hours?

13:19.798 --> 13:21.509
'Cause I think that's what we got.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.477
Tommy's what we used to call a "joiner."

13:31.560 --> 13:33.687
Dreams of becomin' a hero.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.440
So he enlisted in the Army
right outta high school.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.318
A few months later,
they ship him off to Desert Storm.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.238
It's what they called that war.
It doesn't matter.

13:42.321 --> 13:46.408
Point is, bein' in the Army
didn't make him feel much like a hero.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.119
Cut to 12 years later, outbreak happens.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.039
He convinces me to join a group
makin' their way up to Boston,

13:52.122 --> 13:54.583
which I did,
mostly to keep an eye on him,

13:54.667 --> 13:56.001
keep him alive.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.754
It's where we met Tess.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.341
And that whole crew, we--

14:05.010 --> 14:06.929
Well, for what it was, it worked.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.932
And then Tommy meets Marlene.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.936
She talks him into joinin' the Fireflies.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.939
Same mistake he made when he was 18.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.734
Wants to save the world.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.780
Pipe dream.
Him, Fireflies, all of 'em,

14:26.198 --> 14:27.366
delusional.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.619
'Course, last I heard,
he quit the Fireflies, too.

14:31.870 --> 14:34.164
So now he's on his own out there and

14:35.833 --> 14:37.710
I gotta go get him.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.508
If you don't think
there's hope for the world,

14:44.592 --> 14:46.051
why bother going on?

14:47.177 --> 14:49.305
I mean, you gotta try, right?

14:50.764 --> 14:52.683
You haven't seen the world,
so you don't know.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.855
You keep goin' for family.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.608
- That's about it.
- I'm not family.

15:00.691 --> 15:01.567
No,

15:02.401 --> 15:03.777
you're cargo.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.321
And I made a promise to Tess.

15:06.655 --> 15:08.574
And she was like family.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.455
- What if you don't find him?
- I will.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.206
- How do you know?
- I’m persistent.

15:19.918 --> 15:21.629
Ya got up pretty early.
If you wanna grab more sleep--

15:21.712 --> 15:23.339
I'm not even tired.

15:57.581 --> 15:58.707
Stay put.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.938
- Where are we?
- Kansas City.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.192
How far back do we have to go
to get around this?

17:18.078 --> 17:18.871
Screw it.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.540
What are you doing?

17:22.624 --> 17:24.543
We can jog right around this tunnel...

17:25.753 --> 17:27.004
take the next ramp...

17:28.172 --> 17:29.339
and we're back on the road.
Minute tops.

17:48.275 --> 17:49.860
Where the fuck is the highway?

17:49.943 --> 17:51.445
I can't tell from this.
I'm all turned around.

17:51.528 --> 17:52.821
Don't look at the state map.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.782
- Look at the inset.
- I don't know where we are in that either!

17:54.865 --> 17:56.992
This is my second day
in a fucking car, man.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.120
I think we're heading north?

18:08.420 --> 18:09.922
It's gotta be the right.

18:11.089 --> 18:12.466
What the fuck?

18:12.549 --> 18:13.592
Stop!

18:15.177 --> 18:16.887
Is that the QZ?

18:19.264 --> 18:20.599
Where the fuck is FEDRA?

18:22.309 --> 18:23.644
Hey!

18:24.269 --> 18:25.604
Please help!

18:27.564 --> 18:28.690
Put your seatbelt on.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.819
- Aren't we gonna help him?
- No.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.238
Fuck!

18:34.321 --> 18:36.073
- Go, go, go!
- Joel!

18:45.290 --> 18:46.208
Fuck.

18:53.674 --> 18:54.842
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.134
- You're not hurt? Nothin'?
- I don't think so.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.555
Belts off. Fast!

19:10.148 --> 19:11.316
Let's see you, motherfucker!

19:14.653 --> 19:16.947
Give us your shit,
you make it through this!

19:17.030 --> 19:18.156
I promise!

19:19.533 --> 19:20.868
Hey, you see that hole?

19:21.702 --> 19:22.828
Can you squeeze through?

19:26.790 --> 19:28.125
Last chance!

19:28.208 --> 19:30.127
When I say go, you crawl to that wall,

19:30.210 --> 19:31.587
and you squeeze through
and you don't come out

19:31.670 --> 19:33.338
until I say, okay?

19:37.968 --> 19:39.970
And they're not gonna hit you.
Look at me!

19:40.470 --> 19:41.680
They're not gonna hit you.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.766
You stay down, you stay low,
you stay quiet.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.145
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.231
Go!

20:10.042 --> 20:11.293
Fuck!

20:13.754 --> 20:15.339
You motherfucker!

21:07.307 --> 21:08.976
Now you're gonna fuckin' pay!

21:09.059 --> 21:10.227
What you fuckin' did,

21:10.310 --> 21:12.229
you fuckin' killed yourself, motherfucker!

21:48.432 --> 21:50.434
No, no, no, no, no! It's okay. It's okay.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.019
It's over. We're not fighting anymore.

21:53.186 --> 21:54.938
I'm gonna go home.
I'll tell everyone you're good.

21:55.897 --> 21:58.608
I don't know what to do.

21:58.692 --> 22:00.068
My legs don't work.

22:01.653 --> 22:04.197
My mom isn't far,
if you could get me to her.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.078
We could trade with you guys.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.289
We could be friends. I didn't know.

22:12.372 --> 22:14.332
I'm Bryan. I'm Bryan.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.584
What's your name?

22:33.602 --> 22:34.478
Wait, wait, wait.

22:39.107 --> 22:41.443
You can have it.
It's a good knife.

22:46.239 --> 22:47.407
Get back behind the wall.

22:47.491 --> 22:48.950
No, no, no, no!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

22:49.034 --> 22:50.702
Please, please.
We could just talk.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.037
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

22:52.120 --> 22:53.080
Please, please.
No, no, no! Please!

22:53.163 --> 22:55.707
No, please! Please! I'm sorry!

22:55.791 --> 22:57.292
I'm sorry! Please!

22:57.375 --> 22:59.628
You don't have to!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

23:00.170 --> 23:01.630
Please! No, no, no!
We can just talk!

23:01.713 --> 23:04.424
We can just talk!
Mom! Mom! Mom!

23:10.555 --> 23:13.308
Ellie, I gotta get in there.
I can't fit through.

23:16.019 --> 23:18.563
- There's some stuff against the door.
- Well, can you move it?

23:24.611 --> 23:26.530
- Let's go. Fast.
- Right.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.579
I’m okay. I'm good.

23:35.038 --> 23:36.998
I got some food in here still,

23:37.082 --> 23:39.543
and I got your light still.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.254
What now?

23:42.921 --> 23:44.881
- We go up.
- To get a better look?

23:44.965 --> 23:46.758
Hopefully, we spot a clear route out.

23:51.721 --> 23:52.848
Stay close.

23:53.306 --> 23:54.224
Got it.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.331
Bryan!

24:18.832 --> 24:19.958
Bryan!

24:22.460 --> 24:24.045
Body, body!

24:24.129 --> 24:25.005
They got fuckin' Bryan!

24:41.062 --> 24:43.857
I told you. I was alone.

24:43.940 --> 24:47.277
I haven't seen any of those people
since that night.

24:49.279 --> 24:50.864
What else do you want me to say?

24:51.573 --> 24:53.491
I don't know. The truth?

24:56.119 --> 24:57.370
Kathleen.

24:59.122 --> 25:02.751
The Bergquists? No?

25:03.668 --> 25:05.587
Mark Anthony Halpin.

25:06.504 --> 25:09.049
Carrie Schreiber.
You haven't seen them?

25:09.883 --> 25:13.011
The Chans? Henry Burrell.

25:16.932 --> 25:17.849
Okay.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.187
You know where Henry is.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.900
Lawyer.

25:28.276 --> 25:29.569
Medical attention.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.697
Family visit.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.456
I wonder if this is the cell,

25:42.249 --> 25:44.209
where my brother was beaten to death.

25:44.292 --> 25:45.877
You were wronged.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.298
And I'm sorry.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.843
But this has gone too far.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.846
It has to stop.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.225
It has to stop now, you mean?

26:00.976 --> 26:02.894
Now that you're in the cell.

26:03.645 --> 26:06.940
But before, people dying was okay.

26:07.023 --> 26:10.443
When you were safe and protected,
and ratting on your neighbors to FEDRA.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.445
They put a gun to my head.

26:13.571 --> 26:14.489
There.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.994
Have I satisfied the necessary conditions
for you to talk?

26:19.077 --> 26:20.829
Kathleen, for God's sake.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.875
I delivered you.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.630
I held you in my hands.

26:34.801 --> 26:37.429
I never told them
anything about your brother.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.973
But Henry did.

26:41.725 --> 26:44.644
And we know that he's still in the city.

26:45.729 --> 26:47.856
And I think that you know that, too.

26:55.071 --> 26:56.448
Where is he?

27:01.536 --> 27:03.455
You think I won't do it?

27:13.423 --> 27:14.966
I'm your doctor.

27:40.533 --> 27:41.701
Who did this?

27:41.785 --> 27:43.411
We think it was outsiders.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.246
We found a truck, loaded.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.749
It's not a FEDRA vehicle,
but they were heavily supplied.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.250
Could be mercs.

27:50.418 --> 27:53.588
Well, if Henry has a radio,
maybe he found someone out there.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.633
Maybe he called these guys in.

28:00.261 --> 28:01.346
Will he live?

28:06.768 --> 28:08.520
What if I had a doctor?

28:09.020 --> 28:11.356
There's no chance.
I'm sorry.

28:28.039 --> 28:29.165
Open it.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.303
This is Henry's work.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.514
Understand?

28:44.597 --> 28:47.308
And he won't stop until we stop him.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.769
Find who did this.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.939
Find every collaborator

28:53.022 --> 28:54.941
and kill them all.

29:28.808 --> 29:31.060
They're not FEDRA,
and they're not Fireflies,

29:31.144 --> 29:32.770
so who are they?

29:32.854 --> 29:33.980
People.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.816
Are we okay in here?

29:37.942 --> 29:39.319
For a little bit, maybe.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.697
Looks like they're checkin' out
apartment buildings first.

29:44.782 --> 29:47.327
But they'll be coming through
these places soon enough.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.424
There's a really tall building
four blocks away.

30:01.508 --> 30:03.510
- Yeah. Saw it.
- So that's the one?

30:03.593 --> 30:05.970
As soon as we don't hear a truck, we move.

30:07.263 --> 30:08.515
Fast as we can.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.114
Are you okay?

30:29.285 --> 30:30.620
I'm all right.

30:32.580 --> 30:34.457
Are you all right?

30:34.541 --> 30:35.458
Yeah.

30:46.844 --> 30:48.513
Thing is,
is I didn't hear that guy comin',

30:48.596 --> 30:49.722
and

30:50.848 --> 30:52.392
you shouldn't have had to

30:54.185 --> 30:55.436
you know?

30:55.520 --> 30:57.272
Well, you're glad I did, right?

30:58.690 --> 31:00.275
You're just a kid.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.571
You shouldn't know what it means to--

31:07.657 --> 31:08.992
It's not like you killed him.

31:10.410 --> 31:11.327
But...

31:12.370 --> 31:13.705
shootin' or--

31:16.249 --> 31:17.792
I know what it's like

31:18.418 --> 31:20.336
first time that you hurt

31:21.296 --> 31:22.839
someone like that.

31:25.675 --> 31:27.010
If you

31:33.558 --> 31:35.727
- I'm not good at this.
- Yeah, you really aren't.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.854
I mean, it was my fault.

31:37.937 --> 31:39.480
You shouldn't have had to.

31:42.525 --> 31:44.068
And I'm sorry.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.924
It wasn't my first time.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.531
Show me your grip.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.202
Finger off the trigger.

32:36.037 --> 32:37.664
- Now, who taught you that?
- FEDRA school.

32:37.747 --> 32:38.665
Figures.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.167
Your thumb

32:42.043 --> 32:43.252
over your thumb.

32:43.961 --> 32:46.923
Left hand,
squeezes down on the right.

32:47.882 --> 32:49.008
You got it?

32:49.717 --> 32:50.843
There ya go.

32:52.303 --> 32:53.221
Look it.

33:00.687 --> 33:01.771
Okay?

33:21.708 --> 33:23.209
You put it in your pack.

33:24.627 --> 33:26.504
You'll shoot your damn ass off.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.206
We'll get through this.

34:03.833 --> 34:04.959
I know.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.393
No sign of them. You?

34:23.728 --> 34:24.520
Yeah.

35:55.820 --> 35:56.946
They're out of food.

35:58.072 --> 36:00.199
Henry won't let Sam starve.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.577
Double the guards around our provisions.

36:02.660 --> 36:06.247
- He's fucking close. I can feel it.
- Yeah.

36:08.958 --> 36:09.917
What?

36:38.321 --> 36:39.447
Fuck.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.919
Fuck, fuck.

37:00.426 --> 37:02.053
When do we tell the others?

37:04.430 --> 37:05.348
Not yet.

37:06.474 --> 37:08.935
Let's just handle what we have to handle.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.645
- We can deal with this after.
- Kathleen--

37:10.728 --> 37:11.854
After.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.899
Seal off the building for now.

37:16.692 --> 37:17.610
Okay?

37:18.778 --> 37:19.695
Yeah.

37:29.246 --> 37:30.706
You're just gonna put your foot here.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.458
One, two--

37:32.541 --> 37:35.378
- Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
- Straighten up. I got you.

37:39.924 --> 37:43.094
- Okay, I'm in.
- Take a look around first.

37:43.177 --> 37:44.512
Ellie.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.138
Goddamnit.

37:48.307 --> 37:50.059
Where would you be without me, huh?

37:50.601 --> 37:53.270
- By now, Wyoming.
- Oh, yeah.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.730
Walked into that one.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.493
We'll make our way up,
and come morning,

38:07.576 --> 38:10.162
I'll take a look at the city
and find our way out.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.669
We're goin' up 42 flights?

38:16.752 --> 38:18.379
Forty-five.

38:21.924 --> 38:25.344
But no, not all the way.

38:25.428 --> 38:26.762
How far?

38:27.805 --> 38:29.515
As far as I can make it.

38:56.876 --> 38:59.170
Hey, you know that guy
who said he was hurt?

38:59.253 --> 39:01.047
How did you know it was an ambush?

39:05.051 --> 39:06.969
I've been on both sides.

39:08.012 --> 39:11.223
It was a long time ago.
We did what we needed to survive.

39:11.307 --> 39:12.433
You and Tess?

39:13.267 --> 39:15.019
And the people we were with.

39:17.271 --> 39:18.814
My brother, too.

39:23.444 --> 39:25.071
Did you kill innocent people?

39:34.830 --> 39:35.748
C'mon.

39:44.256 --> 39:45.257
Holy shit.

39:47.927 --> 39:51.472
- Yeah.
- Thirty-three floors. That's good.

39:52.264 --> 39:53.808
It's gonna have to be.

39:58.020 --> 40:00.314
- Come on.
- Gimme a minute.

40:00.397 --> 40:01.899
Get up, you lazy ass.

40:06.529 --> 40:07.947
Lazy ass.

40:08.030 --> 40:10.366
Fifty-six years old, you little shit.

40:27.716 --> 40:28.509
Joel?

40:30.886 --> 40:31.804
Joel.

40:33.305 --> 40:34.431
Joel.

40:35.182 --> 40:37.101
- What?
- What are you doing?

40:37.893 --> 40:40.479
I don't want someone sneakin' up on us
while we're sleepin'.

40:42.064 --> 40:44.733
I get it.
Crunch, crunch, crunch.

40:44.817 --> 40:46.026
Are you sure you're gonna hear it?

40:46.110 --> 40:47.987
Of course, I'll hear it.
That's the damn point.

40:48.070 --> 40:48.988
Okay.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.365
Well, good night.

40:54.410 --> 40:55.953
Yeah, good night.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.560
- Hey.
- Yeah?

41:20.936 --> 41:23.272
When we were talkin' about hurtin' people

41:25.024 --> 41:27.318
what did you mean
it wasn't your first time?

41:32.740 --> 41:34.283
I don’t wanna talk about it.

41:37.870 --> 41:38.996
All right.

41:47.296 --> 41:48.839
You don't have to.

41:49.590 --> 41:51.133
I'm just sayin'

41:54.887 --> 41:57.640
it isn't fair, your age

41:58.807 --> 42:00.726
havin' to deal with all of this--

42:03.437 --> 42:05.564
So it gets easier when you get older?

42:09.109 --> 42:11.028
No, not really.

42:12.446 --> 42:13.781
But still.

42:20.037 --> 42:22.414
The reason I asked
whether you'd hear the glass or not

42:22.498 --> 42:25.334
is 'cause I've noticed you don't hear
too well from your right side.

42:26.001 --> 42:27.920
Is it 'cause you were shot there?

42:28.837 --> 42:30.589
Probably more from shootin'.

42:31.048 --> 42:33.592
So if you wanna keep your hearin',
you stick to that knife.

42:43.060 --> 42:43.936
Joel?

42:45.938 --> 42:48.524
Did you know diarrhea is hereditary?

42:49.275 --> 42:51.193
- What?
- Yeah.

42:51.986 --> 42:53.737
It runs in your jeans.

43:01.662 --> 43:03.038
Jesus.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.460
That is so goddamn stupid.

43:08.544 --> 43:10.504
- You laughed, motherfucker.
- I didn't laugh.

43:10.587 --> 43:12.798
- Yes, you did.
- Jesus, I'm losin' it.

43:12.881 --> 43:14.717
You're losin' it big time.

43:30.190 --> 43:33.527
- Go to sleep.
- You go to sleep.

43:45.831 --> 43:46.999
Joel?

43:48.208 --> 43:49.168
Joel!
