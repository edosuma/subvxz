00:49.558 --> 00:52.278
Let me go. I'm beggin' ya.

00:54.615 --> 00:56.310
Let me go.

00:56.437 --> 00:58.101
I'm beggin' ya.

00:59.574 --> 01:01.974
I already told ya
I didn't do it.

01:02.102 --> 01:05.398
Please, let me...

01:07.447 --> 01:08.725
Please!

01:10.231 --> 01:13.047
Confess, confess!

01:13.175 --> 01:14.389
Tell the truth.

01:14.518 --> 01:17.398
You spilled innocent
cranberry juice everywhere.

01:17.525 --> 01:19.445
No, no, it wasn't us.

01:19.575 --> 01:20.502
It wasn't.

01:20.631 --> 01:22.293
Adria did it.

01:22.422 --> 01:24.759
It's Adria who's going
to bed right now.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.134
Aw, no, no, no, no.

01:26.262 --> 01:27.830
We got school
in the morning.
We do?

01:27.958 --> 01:29.462
Yes. Bedtime.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.645
Bedtime, honey.
Hey.

01:30.774 --> 01:31.957
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:32.087 --> 01:33.589
Are you ready
for the big surprise?

01:33.718 --> 01:37.429
Yeah.

01:37.782 --> 01:39.030
Okay.

01:39.158 --> 01:41.365
The horse is going to bed.
He's falling off the cliff.

01:41.494 --> 01:43.221
Oh, he's falling asleep!

01:43.349 --> 01:44.887
And so are you.

01:45.013 --> 01:46.870
Look into my eyes.

01:46.997 --> 01:49.878
Okay?
Good night, sweetie, okay?

01:50.005 --> 01:51.765
Night-night.
Aww.

01:59.766 --> 02:01.973
My night owl's
flying off again.

02:04.695 --> 02:05.783
Are you ready?

02:05.909 --> 02:07.285
I'm always ready.

02:07.414 --> 02:08.886
Will you be listening tonight?

02:09.013 --> 02:11.734
Well, I think I'd rather
hear about it in the morning.

02:11.862 --> 02:13.623
Okay, at breakfast?

02:13.749 --> 02:16.021

Good evening, Mr. Elvis.

04:28.181 --> 04:30.517
Oh, hey, uh...
I'm sorry, I forgot.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.821
Uh... what's your name again?

04:32.948 --> 04:34.996
Hemwatinandan Sunderdas.

04:35.124 --> 04:36.277
Uh, can I call you Bob?

04:36.405 --> 04:38.261
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, how's the family?

04:38.390 --> 04:40.501
Oh, they're great.
Thanks for asking, Bob.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.036
You excited about
the show tonight?

04:42.165 --> 04:44.406
Oh, absolutely. Look.
It's the final.

04:44.531 --> 04:45.876
We'll finally get to find out

04:46.005 --> 04:49.269
if the New York Newbies beat
the Manchester Magic Voices.

04:49.396 --> 04:51.540
I'm all for Manchester!

04:51.669 --> 04:54.580
It's my hometown.
How about you, sir?

04:54.709 --> 04:56.533
Well, I was talking
about my show, Bob.

04:56.660 --> 04:59.125
How do you expect to know what's
happening while I'm on the radio

04:59.253 --> 05:00.469
if you don't even listen?

05:00.596 --> 05:02.325
Oh...

05:03.796 --> 05:06.229
Yep.

05:07.125 --> 05:09.237
- You're in the right direction.
- Elvis.

05:09.845 --> 05:10.709
Hey.

05:12.853 --> 05:15.315
Sorry, I'm late.
How are you?

05:15.444 --> 05:16.756
I'm good, thanks.

05:16.885 --> 05:17.877
Do I know you?

05:18.005 --> 05:20.021
Well, that's funny.

05:20.148 --> 05:21.493
Elvis, do you know this man?

05:21.620 --> 05:23.476
Of course he knows me.
Come on, Elvis, let's go.

05:23.605 --> 05:25.843
No, I don't know this guy.
Sir, who are you?

05:25.973 --> 05:27.763
Hey, nobody's talkin'
to you, asshole.

05:27.893 --> 05:29.140
Hey, come on, buddy, let go.

05:29.268 --> 05:31.412
I will let go
once we get in the studio.

05:31.541 --> 05:32.627
Okay, that's enough.

05:32.757 --> 05:34.196
You got my hand,
I want it back.

05:34.325 --> 05:35.764
Man, come on!

05:38.037 --> 05:39.444
Uh-oh.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.357
If I say that we have
an appointment,

05:42.484 --> 05:44.629
we have an appointment.

05:44.756 --> 05:46.260
It has to be tonight.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.404
I have to announce it tonight.

05:48.532 --> 05:51.444
Okay, whoever you are,
this isn't gonna fly.

05:51.572 --> 05:54.452
All right, that's the last time
you pretend not to know me.

05:54.581 --> 05:56.020
Or else...
Or else what?

05:58.068 --> 05:59.507
Whoa, whoa! Hey.

05:59.637 --> 06:00.597
Calm down here.

06:00.724 --> 06:01.875
Or else I kill myself.

06:02.004 --> 06:04.596
What is it that
you want to announce?

06:05.460 --> 06:06.388
That I'm here.

06:06.516 --> 06:08.725
I-I'm here. I'm...

06:09.364 --> 06:11.059
I'm the Messiah.

06:12.661 --> 06:14.068
I'm back.

06:14.196 --> 06:16.244
Well, why the hell didn't you
say so in the first place?

06:16.372 --> 06:18.932
It is you. It's him.
How you been?

06:19.060 --> 06:21.268
So you do know him?

06:21.396 --> 06:23.955
Yes. Obviously. Don't you?

06:24.084 --> 06:26.739
He's... probably a Buddhist.
He's...

06:26.868 --> 06:29.076
I'm a Hindu, actually.
Oh.

06:29.203 --> 06:32.340
Look. We've been waiting
over 2,000 years for you.

06:32.468 --> 06:34.132
Hey, you got
a lot of work to do.

06:34.260 --> 06:38.004
You gotta make the lame walk
and the blind see.

06:38.132 --> 06:39.508
You gotta save the world.

06:41.172 --> 06:44.276
Can we go up and I can announce
that to everybody?

06:44.405 --> 06:46.356
Why announce that
on the radio?

06:47.348 --> 06:50.164
I mean, you'll only reach
a handful of insomniacs.

06:50.291 --> 06:53.397
Nobody listens
to the radio anymore,
especially not at night.

06:53.523 --> 06:55.572
And what's more,
they won't be able to see you.

06:55.699 --> 06:58.196
And if they can't see you,
they may not believe it's you.

06:58.324 --> 07:03.827
For my money, you get
the best bang for your buck
if you go live stream.

07:06.004 --> 07:07.988
There's a camera
on her computer.

07:09.299 --> 07:10.516
Who?

07:11.732 --> 07:14.643
The woman at the center.

07:14.772 --> 07:16.339
What, the center
of the universe, or...?

07:16.467 --> 07:18.836
They... They put me
at the treatment center.

07:18.964 --> 07:22.867
But there's a camera
on her computer,
and I can record myself.

07:24.372 --> 07:26.484
Then I can get
the message out.
Yeah.

07:26.611 --> 07:27.667
You have a great show.

07:29.779 --> 07:31.283
What's your name again, brother?

07:31.411 --> 07:33.139
Hemwatinandan.

07:34.355 --> 07:35.892
Yeah.

07:39.795 --> 07:41.555
I love you, Elvis!

07:42.035 --> 07:43.443
Thank you.

07:45.715 --> 07:46.963
Fuck.

07:47.796 --> 07:50.355
Lock the door,
and don't let anyone else in.

07:50.484 --> 07:53.843
That shouldn't have happened
in the first place.

07:59.891 --> 08:01.203
<i>It's getting hot in here,</i>

08:01.330 --> 08:04.755
<i>15 minutes before
the wonderful Elvis Cooney.</i>

08:04.883 --> 08:10.644
<i>Enough time to listen together
to this amazing, incredible,
fantastic song.</i>

08:10.771 --> 08:12.786
<i>Oh, you're gonna love it.</i>

08:14.419 --> 08:16.051
Shut up.

08:18.676 --> 08:20.596
Elvis, hi.
Mary.

08:20.722 --> 08:22.259
Man, did you
just roll out of bed?

08:22.387 --> 08:25.075
You look like death warmed up.
I'm not quite warm yet.

08:25.203 --> 08:27.827
Well, anyway, we've got
great callers tonight.

08:27.955 --> 08:29.043
Cool.

08:29.171 --> 08:31.923
And this is
James Steel's biography.

08:32.051 --> 08:33.843
That comedian
who does online videos.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.283
He's got over
two million followers,

08:35.412 --> 08:37.428
and we're gonna
get him on the air.

08:38.388 --> 08:40.818
Thank you.

08:40.947 --> 08:42.355
No problem, it's my job.

08:43.602 --> 08:45.715
No, I mean thank you.

08:46.578 --> 08:47.474
For my birthday.

08:47.602 --> 08:49.843
Oh, sorry, it slipped my mind.

08:49.970 --> 08:51.315
Isn't it tomorrow?

08:51.442 --> 08:54.451
Well, tomorrow's
in about 13 minutes.

08:55.123 --> 08:56.434
That's okay.

08:56.562 --> 08:58.674
Everyone always forgets
my fuckin' birthday.

08:58.803 --> 09:00.563
Happy birthday.

09:02.450 --> 09:04.978
Not yet, in about
12 and a half minutes.

09:06.898 --> 09:08.115
Who's that?

09:08.243 --> 09:10.035
He's the newbie,
just arrived from London.

09:10.163 --> 09:11.347
Long trip to America.

09:11.474 --> 09:13.299
Elvis, this is Dylan.

09:13.426 --> 09:16.466
Dylan, this is Elvis.

09:16.594 --> 09:18.514
Keep your transatlantic germs.
It's okay.

09:18.643 --> 09:20.723
Okay.
You want one of these?

09:20.850 --> 09:23.763
I could make you one
if you'd like.
Uh, no, but thank you.

09:23.891 --> 09:25.043
Mm-hmm.

09:25.170 --> 09:27.410
I was just kidding.
This is for adults.

09:27.538 --> 09:28.818
I am 27.

09:28.947 --> 09:30.226
Don't mind him.

09:30.354 --> 09:32.306
Go to the studio.
Okay.

09:33.939 --> 09:34.995
Oh.

09:35.122 --> 09:36.851
I see Sam is still here.

09:37.394 --> 09:38.674
Yeah.

09:39.731 --> 09:41.843
Should have brought
my rubber gloves.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.282
Hey.

09:47.411 --> 09:48.977
Don't even bother
to knock anymore.

09:49.106 --> 09:51.026
Yeah, just like you don't
even bother to tell me

09:51.154 --> 09:52.627
when you're coming
to watch my show.

09:53.362 --> 09:55.731
What's to watch?
It's a radio show.

09:55.858 --> 09:57.298
You need something?
I'm leaving in a minute.

09:57.427 --> 10:00.754
Oh, well, then why don't we
make this a quality minute?

10:00.882 --> 10:03.058
When was the last time
you stayed this late?

10:03.187 --> 10:05.010
Last year for the sweeps.

10:05.139 --> 10:06.130
Mm-hmm.

10:06.258 --> 10:08.531
Okay, I'll let you guys talk.

10:09.362 --> 10:10.354
Sure.

10:11.954 --> 10:14.002
I'll be listening
to tonight's show in my office.

10:14.130 --> 10:15.218
Oh, thanks, buddy.

10:15.346 --> 10:18.354
Least somebody around here
gives a damn.

10:19.697 --> 10:21.555
Hey, since you're here.

10:23.730 --> 10:26.034
I'm looking
at the quarter numbers.

10:26.163 --> 10:28.338
Whoo! Okay.

10:28.466 --> 10:30.130
You've plateaued.

10:30.258 --> 10:32.050
Your numbers are flat.

10:32.177 --> 10:34.194
Flat as a crepe.

10:34.322 --> 10:36.467
Crepe, crepe? Oh, pancake.
Yeah, that's pretty flat.

10:36.593 --> 10:38.545
But it's just one quarter,
that doesn't mean anything.

10:38.674 --> 10:42.514
I think you have two problems.
Oh. Nobody has
just two problems.

10:42.641 --> 10:45.042
Okay, first, the audience.

10:45.170 --> 10:47.090
They're not interested
in your social media.

10:47.218 --> 10:48.497
Well, and neither am I.

10:48.625 --> 10:51.025
That's why Mary
takes care of it.

10:51.155 --> 10:52.530
Okay,
blame Mary if you want.

10:52.657 --> 10:54.258
Either way, it's a disaster.

10:54.386 --> 10:55.923
Please, not this again.

10:56.050 --> 10:58.930
I'm a radio host,
not a TikTok jock.
Look at your last post.

10:59.057 --> 11:02.130
Three months ago,
and all you said was, "Hey,"

11:02.258 --> 11:03.890
with a big shot
of your fucking boots?

11:04.017 --> 11:06.579
They were great,
very cool boots, size 12s.

11:06.705 --> 11:08.114
Oh, gosh.
Okay, look.

11:08.242 --> 11:10.770
I'm the first to admit,
I'm not good at that stuff.

11:10.898 --> 11:12.529
That's not me.
Yeah, we all know that.

11:12.657 --> 11:15.409
But today, radio
is not enough. Okay?

11:15.537 --> 11:17.297
Why don't you just
let me do what I do?

11:17.425 --> 11:19.186
I mean,
let's not rock the boat.

11:19.313 --> 11:21.170
Okay, so you're not
listening to me.

11:21.297 --> 11:23.921
The boat is sinking, Elvis.

11:25.106 --> 11:27.313
What?
You're...

11:28.113 --> 11:29.265
different, somehow different.

11:29.393 --> 11:30.930
What?
Have you done...

11:31.058 --> 11:33.074
You know, you're really
stunningly statuesque.
Can you stop?

11:33.201 --> 11:34.833
Stop. Nice try, though.

11:34.962 --> 11:38.098
Second thing, I think
you're pushing too much.

11:38.226 --> 11:40.786
Now, I've told you before,
you've got a great concept.

11:40.914 --> 11:43.409
Okay? Telling it like it is,
take no mercy,

11:43.537 --> 11:45.649
and all that is
what makes you, I get it.

11:45.779 --> 11:46.673
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:46.803 --> 11:47.921
But there's a pushback now.

11:48.049 --> 11:50.097
Pushback from who?

11:51.281 --> 11:52.817
From the Pope.
Oh, he listens?

11:52.945 --> 11:54.065
<i>Wow, you should get him to call.</i>

11:54.193 --> 11:55.697
I could tell him
how to separate--

11:55.826 --> 11:57.233
Stop, no! Stop.

11:57.363 --> 12:00.017
I think you can afford now
to slow down, you know?

12:03.218 --> 12:04.178
No, you're wrong.

12:04.305 --> 12:05.778
Stop pushing the envelope.

12:05.905 --> 12:08.497
If not, someday the big boss
is going to replace you.

12:08.626 --> 12:10.802
Is that right? Who?

12:10.929 --> 12:11.920
Is that a threat?

12:12.049 --> 12:14.386
No, honey,
it's not a threat.

12:14.513 --> 12:17.233
It's a tip, okay,
from a very good friend.

12:17.361 --> 12:20.689
Now, get out.
Have a good show tonight.

12:20.816 --> 12:24.338
Wow. That was actually...
two quality minutes.

12:24.465 --> 12:26.769
Just... goodbye.

12:32.561 --> 12:35.345
Well, hey!

12:35.473 --> 12:39.217
If it isn't
"the greatest radio host
in the world."

12:39.345 --> 12:41.041
You know,
now that I'm not on the air,

12:41.169 --> 12:43.793
I can tell you how
I really feel about you.

12:43.921 --> 12:45.073
You...

12:45.201 --> 12:46.386
piece of shit.

12:46.513 --> 12:48.401
How you doing, Justin?

12:48.528 --> 12:51.345
Your expression tells me
that you're still having
trouble with those hemorrhoids.

12:51.473 --> 12:54.321
The only pain in the ass
around here is you.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.489
You will never get my show.

12:57.616 --> 12:58.545
Do you hear me?

12:58.673 --> 13:01.330
Listen. You will never,
ever have my show.

13:01.456 --> 13:03.313
But I don't want your show.
Liar!

13:03.441 --> 13:05.297
You were just in there
with Sam asking for it.

13:05.425 --> 13:08.145
Justin, I was not in there
to ask for your show.

13:08.274 --> 13:10.448
Stop! Just stop lying, okay?

13:10.576 --> 13:11.760
Justin,
I don't want your show.

13:11.889 --> 13:14.288
I'm not lying.
I don't want your show.

13:15.248 --> 13:16.146
You don't?

13:16.272 --> 13:18.098
No. I just want your slot.

13:18.224 --> 13:20.080
It's an entirely
different thing.

13:20.208 --> 13:22.161
Quite frankly,
your show plays shitty music

13:22.288 --> 13:23.665
and you're just there
to tell the time.

13:23.794 --> 13:26.065
They should have called it
"Justin Time." It's torture.

13:26.192 --> 13:27.537
It's like listening
to the local radio

13:27.665 --> 13:30.769
slap bang in the middle of
Squeal-like-a-pig Arkansas.

13:31.473 --> 13:32.753
I'm from Arkansas.

13:32.881 --> 13:34.544
Yeah, that's what I mean.

13:36.528 --> 13:38.801
Fuck you, Elvis.

13:38.929 --> 13:39.889
Thank you.

13:40.018 --> 13:41.777
Guys. Guys.
Fuck you!

13:41.905 --> 13:44.656
The snappy comebacks.
How does he do it?

13:44.785 --> 13:47.248
We're live in one minute,
47 seconds.

13:47.376 --> 13:48.208
Dickhead.

13:48.336 --> 13:50.385
And dickhead's on top.

13:59.408 --> 14:00.785
Whoo-hoo.

14:11.120 --> 14:14.992
<i>Elvis Live, "On the Line."</i>

14:15.698 --> 14:18.064
It's midnight.

14:18.192 --> 14:19.538
The witching hour.

14:19.664 --> 14:23.121
Good morning
to all you night-crawling,
circadian rhythm rejects,

14:23.249 --> 14:26.609
you nocturnal emitters
that I like to call my family.

14:26.735 --> 14:29.393
The studio's filling up,
everybody's getting settled,

14:29.520 --> 14:31.888
and Mary's either manning
the phones or phoning her man.

14:32.017 --> 14:33.296
Which is it, Mary?

14:33.424 --> 14:35.984
You mean which man?
I get around, Elvis.

14:36.112 --> 14:37.552
Yeah, be careful.

14:37.681 --> 14:39.727
You get around too much,
you'll get rounder.

14:39.855 --> 14:41.872
Hi.
We're expecting your calls.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.951
Talk to Elvis live on air

14:44.080 --> 14:46.800
and tell him about all
of your issues and problems,

14:46.928 --> 14:49.233
<i>below or above the waist.</i>

14:49.360 --> 14:51.888
Call us at 806-806-TALK.

14:52.017 --> 14:55.057
806-806-8255.

14:55.184 --> 14:56.559
That's right.

14:56.688 --> 15:00.336
And this evening, we've got
a newbie joining the show.

15:00.465 --> 15:01.713
A rookie.

15:02.544 --> 15:05.328
And his name is...
let's have a drumroll...

15:05.456 --> 15:06.735
his name is...

15:06.864 --> 15:08.304
What's your name again?

15:08.432 --> 15:09.648
Dylan.

15:09.775 --> 15:13.775
Dylan. Dylan replaces
our old pal, Turncoat Tom,

15:13.905 --> 15:16.559
who left us for a rival
station, that rat bastard.

15:16.688 --> 15:18.383
You won't betray us like that,
will you, Dill?

15:18.511 --> 15:22.223
Uh, yes. I mean, um, no.
Good evening.

15:22.801 --> 15:23.857
Good evening, everyone.

15:23.984 --> 15:25.648
Oh, God, we got a shy one.

15:25.777 --> 15:27.376
You got stage fright?

15:27.504 --> 15:29.104
No, not at all.

15:29.232 --> 15:32.272
It's just that...
it's a real honor
to be part of this show

15:32.401 --> 15:33.904
that has been around
for so long.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.881
I'm... so happy to be here.

15:38.447 --> 15:40.528
"So long"? What are you
trying to say, kid?

15:40.655 --> 15:44.688
That I'm a washed-up,
diaper-wearing has-been,
is that it?

15:46.383 --> 15:47.343
No.

15:47.472 --> 15:49.103
I've been doing this show
for 40 years,

15:49.231 --> 15:52.687
long enough to spot
an elder-abuse asshole
when I see one.

15:53.584 --> 15:55.087
You know, life's too short.

15:55.216 --> 15:57.232
Or in my case too long,
huh, Dylan?

15:57.361 --> 15:58.479
Huh? Hmm?

15:58.608 --> 15:59.887
Get lost. You're fired.

16:00.016 --> 16:02.415
Take a plane, take a boat,
swim the Channel.

16:02.543 --> 16:05.712
Go back to fuckin' England,
or wherever the fuck
you came from.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.071
Go on. Huh.

16:09.712 --> 16:10.991
Why are you smiling?

16:11.119 --> 16:13.295
You think I'm kidding?
He thinks I'm kidding.

16:13.425 --> 16:15.951
Mary can produce the show.
She's done it a million times.

16:16.079 --> 16:19.088
Get lost, go on.
Out, finished, over.

16:19.983 --> 16:22.032
Now!
What are you waiting for?

16:22.160 --> 16:23.599
Geez.

16:23.727 --> 16:26.319
Okay, bring in the next one.

16:31.247 --> 16:34.063
Well, that didn't
last very long, did it?

16:34.575 --> 16:35.567
I'm kidding.

16:35.696 --> 16:38.063
Oh, Dylan, come on back.
We love you, come on.

16:38.191 --> 16:39.663
I'm just joking, kid.
Come on back.

16:39.791 --> 16:40.974
Get in here.

16:41.103 --> 16:43.023
Look at him.
He looks like he's gonna cry.

16:44.847 --> 16:46.830
Come on, kid.
It's just a joke for the newbie.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.551
Sit down.
We'll have some soft foods.

16:49.678 --> 16:51.598
Yeah, and with a Geritol
as a chaser.

16:51.728 --> 16:53.231
There you go.
There's the spirit.

16:53.359 --> 16:55.343
You just can't help yourself.
Yeah.

16:57.007 --> 16:58.031
All right, people.

16:58.159 --> 16:59.887
Here we go.

17:00.014 --> 17:01.999
Settle in, relax.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.272
Gimme a call.

17:04.399 --> 17:06.638
This is "On the Line."

17:08.016 --> 17:11.087
<i>Talk to Elvis! "On the Line"!</i>

17:11.216 --> 17:13.551
Emma, good evening.
What's on your mind?

17:13.678 --> 17:16.816
<i>Good evening, Elvis,
and the rest of the team.</i>

17:16.943 --> 17:18.447
<i>Um...</i>

17:18.575 --> 17:21.262
<i>Well, two months ago
my husband left me</i>

17:21.390 --> 17:23.600
<i>after 17 years of marriage,</i>

17:23.727 --> 17:25.712
<i>and I'm devastated.</i>

17:25.871 --> 17:28.175
Oh, I'm sorry.
How did that happen?

17:29.520 --> 17:30.927
<i>Well, he was so jealous.</i>

17:31.056 --> 17:32.814
<i>He thought
I was cheating on him.</i>

17:32.944 --> 17:35.119
Ah, I get it. Jealousy.

17:35.247 --> 17:36.848
Sometimes flattering.

17:36.976 --> 17:40.431
Lets us know
we're still desirable,
but too much, eh, not good.

17:40.558 --> 17:43.246
What made him think
you were cheating on him?

17:43.374 --> 17:45.776
<i>Actually, maybe, because...</i>

17:45.903 --> 17:47.439
<i>I was cheating on him.</i>

17:48.816 --> 17:50.543
Well,
that explains the jealousy.

17:51.183 --> 17:52.847
Look, we're only human.

17:52.973 --> 17:54.606
Seventeen years
of marriage, wow,

17:54.734 --> 17:56.910
I guess he's, uh...
I guess he's hurt.

17:57.039 --> 17:58.799
Might be tough to get him back.

17:58.927 --> 18:02.926
Uh, you know,
you guys should talk about
why you think it happened.

18:03.055 --> 18:06.447
I'm sure it's not because
he's left a wet towel
on the bed or something.

18:06.575 --> 18:08.015
<i>Yeah.</i>

18:08.142 --> 18:09.358
If you still love each other,

18:09.488 --> 18:11.439
and, you know,
perhaps he still does,

18:11.567 --> 18:14.575
um... it's worth having
another crack at it,

18:14.703 --> 18:15.790
it's worth working.

18:15.917 --> 18:17.520
I mean, you should do
whatever it takes,

18:17.646 --> 18:19.757
whatever it takes
to fix it, okay?

18:19.886 --> 18:21.071
Be honest, be open.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.406
<i>Okay.
Right?</i>

18:23.534 --> 18:24.847
<i>Yeah, thank you.</i>

18:24.975 --> 18:26.639
Matt, I'm sorry
to disagree with you.

18:26.767 --> 18:29.806
He's a great player
but a bad sport.

18:29.935 --> 18:30.959
I never liked him.

18:31.086 --> 18:32.654
I've got some bad news.

18:32.782 --> 18:34.926
We were supposed to get
James Steel on the line.

18:35.053 --> 18:36.399
Oh.
But his manager just told me

18:36.527 --> 18:38.191
that he's tied up
shooting a video,

18:38.319 --> 18:41.006
and there are some issues
that need his attention.

18:41.135 --> 18:42.351
Fuck.

18:43.151 --> 18:45.773
Tell him to go jump
off a fucking cliff,

18:45.903 --> 18:48.175
with sharpened wooden stakes
on the bottom so he lands...

18:48.303 --> 18:49.647
I hate these new
Internet stars

18:49.774 --> 18:52.334
that make three videos
in their mom's basement

18:52.461 --> 18:55.150
and suddenly they think
they're Bouncy Knowles.

18:55.759 --> 18:56.430
Beyoncé?

18:56.558 --> 18:58.382
Well, she's bouncy to me.

18:58.510 --> 19:00.877
That guy's stuck at a shoot
at 1:00 in the morning

19:01.006 --> 19:02.382
when he's supposed to be
calling us?

19:02.510 --> 19:03.662
I call bullshit.

19:03.790 --> 19:05.358
He's probably home
playing video games,

19:05.486 --> 19:06.893
speed bagging the pickle.

19:07.023 --> 19:08.621
You remember this guy's name?

19:08.750 --> 19:10.606
James Steel. He's a star.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.814
Dylan, you know
who I'm talking about, right?

19:12.943 --> 19:14.413
I'm... not sure.

19:14.541 --> 19:15.790
Yes, he's an asshole,

19:15.919 --> 19:17.390
and we'll never mention
his name again, okay?

19:17.518 --> 19:19.470
Who are we talking about?
Yeah, you're learning.

19:19.598 --> 19:21.583
Okay, we got Gary on the line.

19:21.710 --> 19:23.310
What say you, Gary?

19:27.534 --> 19:28.781
Gary, you with us?

19:31.983 --> 19:32.782
Gary?

19:37.421 --> 19:39.534
Uh-oh, we got a breather.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.414
What are you wearing, Gary?

19:42.542 --> 19:44.527
Hey, Dylan,
you asleep at the wheel?

19:44.654 --> 19:47.117
Can you get Gary through to us?
He's on.

19:48.238 --> 19:49.454
<i>I'm here.</i>

19:50.542 --> 19:52.685
Ah, there he is.

19:53.486 --> 19:55.310
How you doing, Gary?

19:55.439 --> 19:57.102
<i>I'm not doing so hot, Elvis.</i>

19:58.030 --> 20:00.141
What, tonsillitis,
athlete's foot?

20:00.270 --> 20:01.965
Tell me more.

20:04.014 --> 20:06.382
<i>I'm gonna do something
really screwed up tonight.</i>

20:06.510 --> 20:08.590
Suicide.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.559
All right, Gary, listen.

20:12.686 --> 20:15.022
All's well. We're here for you.
We're like family.

20:15.149 --> 20:17.390
Family that isn't fucked up.
You know that, right?

20:18.414 --> 20:19.756
Now, where are you right now?

20:22.733 --> 20:24.397
<i>I'm sorry, this was a bad idea.</i>

20:24.525 --> 20:26.222
Gary. Shit. Mary, call him back.

20:26.349 --> 20:29.583
Okay, well,
we'll try and get Gary back
on the line very quickly

20:29.709 --> 20:31.310
to understand
what's going on with him,

20:31.438 --> 20:33.613
and in the meantime,
we'll take more calls.

20:34.765 --> 20:38.094
<i>So, I have this central
erotic dream with my boss</i>

20:38.222 --> 20:39.916
<i>and I'm a little bit
confused, okay,</i>

20:40.046 --> 20:43.853
<i>because today he told me that
he had the same dream as me.</i>

20:43.982 --> 20:45.262
What do you do for work?

20:45.390 --> 20:47.726
<i>I work for a mattress company.</i>

20:49.294 --> 20:51.341
He wants to test-drive the bed.

20:52.174 --> 20:53.838
Yeah, so when I was a kid,

20:53.966 --> 20:55.693
I was terrified of clowns.

20:56.718 --> 21:01.005
You know, so when I grew up,
I decided to face my fears.

21:01.134 --> 21:04.716
And one day,
I slept with a female clown.

21:04.845 --> 21:07.118
Red hair. Big shoes.

21:07.246 --> 21:09.198
Wouldn't take her nose off.
It was weird.

21:09.325 --> 21:10.605
Hmm.

21:11.597 --> 21:14.061
I woke up the next morning
alone, and, uh,

21:14.766 --> 21:17.038
she'd twisted my penis
into a poodle.

21:17.165 --> 21:19.821
Whoa!

21:22.349 --> 21:24.078
We gotta fix this problem.

21:24.205 --> 21:28.429
I mean, how can 11 laptops
magically disappear
in the space of three months?

21:28.558 --> 21:30.669
We're in a radio station,
cameras everywhere.

21:30.797 --> 21:32.398
This is dickin' rifuckulous.

21:32.524 --> 21:35.373
Probably just some dude
trying to build his collection.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.229
Or collect what he can
from the building.

21:37.356 --> 21:39.244
It's kind of hard to describe.

21:40.493 --> 21:43.662
Somewhere between a bald eagle
and a spotted owl.

21:43.789 --> 21:46.317
Who hasn't tried
a little endangered species?

21:46.446 --> 21:49.932
<i>Elvis is on
KLAT-FM Los Angeles.</i>

21:50.061 --> 21:52.333
<i>Live "On the Line."</i>

21:54.285 --> 21:56.908
Okay, good news.
Gary's back on the air.

21:57.037 --> 21:59.053
We were worried about you, pal.
How you feelin'?

21:59.180 --> 22:00.813
<i>I'm better.</i>

22:01.293 --> 22:02.348
All right.

22:02.477 --> 22:04.365
Um, where are you?

22:04.493 --> 22:06.124
<i>I'm... I'm in Pasadena.</i>

22:06.253 --> 22:08.781
Cool. Pasadena. You alone?

22:08.909 --> 22:11.117
<i>Look, I'm just gonna
do what needs to be done.</i>

22:11.245 --> 22:12.366
<i>It's better that way.</i>

22:12.493 --> 22:14.157
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Gary, hold on.

22:14.285 --> 22:15.819
Gimme a minute. Let's talk.

22:15.949 --> 22:17.549
I love Pasadena.

22:17.676 --> 22:19.789
Where exactly are you?

22:22.605 --> 22:23.948
Gary, you there?

22:25.229 --> 22:26.668
<i>I'm in a garden.</i>

22:27.149 --> 22:29.101
Okay, in a garden.

22:29.228 --> 22:32.748
Is it, uh... your garden?
Are you at home?

22:33.869 --> 22:34.764
<i>No.</i>

22:34.893 --> 22:36.269
No. Uh...

22:36.397 --> 22:38.764
Does the home belong
to someone you know?

22:38.892 --> 22:40.748
<i>No.</i>

22:40.876 --> 22:42.988
<i>It belongs to a piece of shit.</i>

22:43.117 --> 22:44.237
<i>I'm gonna destroy him.</i>

22:44.365 --> 22:45.612
Call the police.

22:45.741 --> 22:48.492
Gary, tell me, is it the home
of a family member,

22:48.620 --> 22:49.997
a neighbor, a colleague, a...

22:50.125 --> 22:51.500
<i>I told you...
...ex-lover?</i>

22:51.628 --> 22:53.357
<i>...it's a worthless
piece of shit's place.</i>

22:53.485 --> 22:54.701
<i>Right.
And I'm...</i>

22:54.828 --> 22:56.780
<i>I'm gonna take out
his whole family.</i>

22:58.445 --> 22:59.820
Gary, come on.

22:59.949 --> 23:01.773
<i>Why hurt his family
If he's a worthless
piece of shit?</i>

23:01.901 --> 23:03.468
I mean, they're innocent.

23:03.597 --> 23:06.061
Don't let your instinct
for revenge drive you
to do something

23:06.189 --> 23:09.388
that you'll probably
be paying for
the rest of your life.

23:10.572 --> 23:12.395
You're better than that, Gary.

23:12.524 --> 23:16.492
Tell me calmly,
what's this guy done to you
to make you so upset?

23:16.621 --> 23:18.732
Some injustice,
some hurt, some...?

23:18.860 --> 23:21.933
<i>He destroyed my life,
and I'm gonna destroy his.</i>

23:22.061 --> 23:24.300
<i>Ay, ay, ay,
an eye for an eye.</i>

23:24.428 --> 23:28.140
Gary, you're playing a game
called "You Lose," all right?

23:28.268 --> 23:31.437
Now, whoever he is,
he didn't destroy your life.

23:31.563 --> 23:33.357
Don't give him that power.

23:33.483 --> 23:34.700
You know?

23:34.828 --> 23:36.300
People come
on this show every day

23:36.428 --> 23:37.901
that feel desperate,
hopeless, worthless,

23:38.029 --> 23:40.588
usually because somebody else
made them feel that way, okay?

23:40.717 --> 23:44.012
Do not adopt that perception
of yourself, all right?

23:44.973 --> 23:48.172
You got the power to change,
you got the tools inbuilt.

23:48.300 --> 23:50.860
You gotta believe that, Gary.
You can do it.

23:50.988 --> 23:54.412
Gary, what was that?

23:54.540 --> 23:56.716
<i>I'm breaking into
the son of a bitch's house!</i>

23:56.845 --> 23:58.380
Gary, stop, wait, listen.

23:58.508 --> 24:01.356
If you want, we can chat
about this offline.

24:01.484 --> 24:03.148
I mean, we can, you know...
Cool?

24:03.276 --> 24:06.028
<i>No. I wanna stay on the air.
I'll put on a record, I swear.</i>

24:06.156 --> 24:08.652
<i>I want everyone to hear
what's going down.</i>

24:09.708 --> 24:11.468
I can't keep you on the air.
I'm sorry.

24:11.597 --> 24:13.772
Let's chat offline.
I promise you,
together we can fix it.

24:13.900 --> 24:15.564
<i>No!
Do not cut me off the air,</i>

24:15.693 --> 24:18.027
<i>or I'll go upstairs
and I'll kill everybody.</i>

24:18.795 --> 24:19.916
You're not gonna
kill anyone.

24:20.044 --> 24:22.764
All right?
Everything's gonna be fine.

24:23.596 --> 24:24.684
You're still live on air,

24:24.811 --> 24:26.412
but I don't want you
to be in danger

24:26.540 --> 24:28.556
or put anyone else
in danger, okay?

24:29.707 --> 24:33.388
Now, what part
of Pasadena are you in?

24:34.156 --> 24:35.692
<i>Near Arlington Gardens.</i>

24:35.819 --> 24:38.540
Ah. Well, yeah, nice area.

24:38.667 --> 24:41.675
<i>Yeah, it's a neighborhood
you know all too well</i>

24:41.804 --> 24:44.523
<i>'cause I'm at your house.</i>

24:45.771 --> 24:48.268
<i>976 Orange Grove Boulevard.</i>

24:48.396 --> 24:51.340
<i>It's crazy
what a nice house you can buy</i>

24:51.468 --> 24:53.996
<i>when you host a shitty show
like yours!</i>

24:54.892 --> 24:56.683
Gary, I don't know if this
is some kind of joke.

24:56.812 --> 24:58.955
I mean, I got nothing
to hide from my listeners.

24:59.084 --> 25:01.420
Yes, that is my address.

25:01.547 --> 25:04.908
But I think you're gonna
have a little trouble
getting across the garden.

25:05.036 --> 25:07.307
<i>Oh, you're talking about
the two mangy Dobermans?</i>

25:07.436 --> 25:09.515
<i>Listen, buddy...</i>

25:09.644 --> 25:13.387
<i>This afternoon, I threw them
a couple pieces of meat
with rat poison.</i>

25:13.515 --> 25:15.435
<i>I thought I might
have to fight them off
a little bit tonight,</i>

25:15.564 --> 25:18.539
<i>but what do you know,
when I got here they were just
lying on the ground.</i>

25:18.667 --> 25:21.164
<i>I was, uh, kind enough
to relieve their suffering</i>

25:21.291 --> 25:23.020
<i>with a butcher's knife.</i>

25:30.956 --> 25:32.844
- Call 911.
- Yeah.

25:34.924 --> 25:37.548
If that's true,
and you're really at my house,

25:37.675 --> 25:39.468
we'll continue
this conversation offline.

25:39.595 --> 25:41.355
Off the air.
The police will be there
in a minute--

25:41.484 --> 25:45.195
<i>I don't give a fuck
about the cops,
and you better not cut me off.</i>

25:45.323 --> 25:46.636
<i>Gary. Hold on a second.
Don't cut me off!</i>

25:46.763 --> 25:48.075
<i>Don't you dare!
Dylan, music, music.</i>

25:48.203 --> 25:49.547
Dylan, wake up!
Put on a fucking song!

25:49.676 --> 25:51.403
<i>Don't cut me off!
I have no choice, Gary.</i>

25:51.531 --> 25:53.643
<i>- We can't let you...
- Daddy!</i>

25:56.235 --> 25:57.675
Adria?

26:00.939 --> 26:02.764
<i>I should have given her
rat poison, too,</i>

26:02.891 --> 26:05.707
<i>but I wanted her
to be part of the fun.</i>

26:05.835 --> 26:07.403
Listen, it's over.

26:07.531 --> 26:10.123
The police
will be there in a minute.
Leave my daughter alone.

26:11.404 --> 26:13.259
It's not too late.
I won't press charges,
I promise.

26:13.387 --> 26:14.762
I just want you
to get some help.

26:14.890 --> 26:15.914
The police are on their way.

26:16.043 --> 26:17.675
<i>Tell the cops to stay outside.</i>

26:17.803 --> 26:19.915
<i>We don't need them
for the show.</i>

26:20.939 --> 26:22.571
There is no show, Gary.

26:22.698 --> 26:25.451
The reality is,
the police will take you out
if you don't comply.

26:25.579 --> 26:28.267
Now, I won't press charges.
I just want you
to leave my fam--

26:31.690 --> 26:34.602
Gary, what was that?
What the fuck's happening?
Holy shit, what...

26:34.731 --> 26:35.626
<i>Honey...</i>

26:35.756 --> 26:37.291
Oh... Olivia?

26:37.420 --> 26:39.307
<i>Elvis.
Baby, you all right?</i>

26:39.435 --> 26:41.770
<i>Do as he says, please,
I'm begging you.</i>

26:41.899 --> 26:44.779
<i>He just fired shots
into the fucking wall!</i>

26:44.906 --> 26:48.554
<i>Yeah, you'll have
to touch up the paint
a little bit, sorry.</i>

26:48.683 --> 26:50.188
<i>That was just
to shut your trap.</i>

26:50.315 --> 26:52.842
<i>Next time, I'm gonna aim for
your daughter and your wife.</i>

26:52.971 --> 26:55.179
The police are there.
They're waiting for backup.

26:55.307 --> 26:56.554
Try to buy some time.
Okay.

26:56.682 --> 26:57.546
Yep.

26:58.219 --> 27:01.963
Gary, I'm listening. Okay?

27:02.794 --> 27:04.330
Tell me what's going on?

27:05.035 --> 27:06.890
Tell me what
you're pissed about.

27:07.019 --> 27:09.514
I mean, clearly,
I don't know you, but...

27:09.643 --> 27:13.164
you're obviously
very angry with me
and I need to know why.

27:13.291 --> 27:15.659
I mean,
maybe we can settle this.

27:16.715 --> 27:18.092
Did I give you some bad advice?

27:18.218 --> 27:20.202
Did I give bad advice
to someone you know?

27:20.330 --> 27:22.314
You blame me for something?
I mean, what is it about?

27:22.443 --> 27:24.874
Is it about a girl?
Did I tell her to leave you?

27:25.003 --> 27:26.442
Something to do with your job?

27:26.571 --> 27:29.642
Listen, you got the air
all to yourself, okay?

27:29.770 --> 27:30.986
So just off-load,

27:31.114 --> 27:33.578
'cause I gotta know
why it is you hate me.

27:35.019 --> 27:36.843
<i>Ahh, Elvis.</i>

27:36.971 --> 27:38.730
<i>You know, I'm embarrassed
to talk about this</i>

27:38.859 --> 27:40.811
<i>in front of your wife
and your daughter,</i>

27:40.938 --> 27:44.330
<i>but since you insist,
it might have something
to do with the fact</i>

27:44.458 --> 27:48.234
<i>that you're sleeping
with your fucking
switchboard operator.</i>

27:50.571 --> 27:53.162
Gary, have you been drinking
or are you on
some kind of drugs?

27:53.290 --> 27:54.859
'Cause I... I don't know you.

27:54.985 --> 27:56.587
You don't know me,
Mary doesn't know...

27:56.714 --> 27:58.474
You know this guy?

28:00.010 --> 28:01.386
Who are you, Gary?

28:01.514 --> 28:04.427
Are you a fan of the show
just trying to create
some kind of buzz,

28:04.554 --> 28:06.410
some sort of prank?

28:06.538 --> 28:07.978
Well, congratulations.
It's working.

28:08.106 --> 28:09.579
You got me, okay?

28:09.706 --> 28:12.042
I'm scared to fucking death,
man, honestly.

28:12.170 --> 28:13.676
Now, look,
you've had your laughs--

28:13.802 --> 28:15.849
<i>Stop fucking around,
shit brain.</i>

28:15.978 --> 28:17.322
<i>You think I actually
listen to your show</i>

28:17.451 --> 28:19.594
<i>for insomniac freaks
who call up...</i>

28:19.722 --> 28:21.962
<i>Okay.
...for your shitty advice?</i>

28:22.090 --> 28:24.299
Calm down, now.
What do you want?

28:25.067 --> 28:26.987
Nobody wants anybody
to get hurt, okay?

28:27.115 --> 28:30.027
<i>Don't talk to me
like I'm one of
your airhead listeners.</i>

28:30.154 --> 28:33.450
<i>I wanna ruin your life,
just like you ruined mine.</i>

28:34.666 --> 28:35.594
Gary, is it money?

28:35.722 --> 28:37.002
Is that what it is?

28:37.130 --> 28:38.539
It's all about money?
You need money?

28:38.666 --> 28:40.491
<i>Money?</i>

28:40.618 --> 28:41.994
<i>Seriously,
if I wanted money,</i>

28:42.122 --> 28:45.323
<i>I'd just help myself
to your yuppie suburban palace.</i>

28:45.451 --> 28:46.889
<i>Oh, uh, wait a second.</i>

28:47.018 --> 28:48.970
<i>I think your wife
wants to talk to you.</i>

28:49.098 --> 28:52.043
<i>How did we
get into this mess, Elvis?</i>

28:52.171 --> 28:53.482
<i>What the hell did you do?</i>

28:53.609 --> 28:55.401
<i>I'm gonna put you
on speakerphone</i>

28:55.529 --> 28:57.322
<i>'cause I wanna hear
how the greatest bigmouth</i>

28:57.449 --> 28:59.114
<i>in the world of radio
handles this.</i>

28:59.242 --> 29:03.210
<i>Careful, though: if you lie,
boom, I will shoot somebody.</i>

29:06.378 --> 29:10.218
<i>Oh, no, Elvis,
you do not have the right
to remain silent.</i>

29:10.346 --> 29:12.010
<i>We're all listening.</i>

29:12.138 --> 29:15.881
<i>Your affair with Mary:
true or false?</i>

29:21.738 --> 29:25.002
Gary, I don't know
what makes you think

29:25.130 --> 29:26.409
that there's a relationship
with Mary,

29:26.538 --> 29:28.329
because I swear to God,
I never--

29:28.458 --> 29:31.882
<i>- Bullshit!
- Stop fucking around, Elvis!</i>

29:32.010 --> 29:33.290
<i>I swore that
I would shoot someone.</i>

29:33.418 --> 29:36.170
<i>Olivia, can you confirm
that I shot someone?</i>

29:38.281 --> 29:39.273
<i>Elvis.</i>

29:39.401 --> 29:41.898
<i>I shot at your ugly face</i>

29:42.026 --> 29:44.393
<i>on that narcissistic poster
hanging on the wall.</i>

29:44.522 --> 29:45.771
<i>The next time...
Good one, Gary.</i>

29:45.898 --> 29:47.048
<i>...next time...</i>

29:47.177 --> 29:48.651
<i>Leave her alone!</i>

29:48.778 --> 29:51.081
<i>Please, I'm begging you!
I'm begging you, please!</i>

29:51.209 --> 29:52.937
<i>Don't hurt her!
Gary? Gary.</i>

29:53.064 --> 29:54.889
I want you to take a minute--

29:55.017 --> 29:57.834
<i>Listen.
I want you to hear this.</i>

30:01.417 --> 30:05.897
<i>That's my gun pressed
against your daughter's temple.</i>

30:06.026 --> 30:08.778
<i>So, how about you tell us
the fucking truth?</i>

30:10.249 --> 30:12.618
<i>Are you screwing
the switchboard operator?</i>

30:12.747 --> 30:13.738
<i>Yes or no?</i>

30:23.688 --> 30:25.258
Yes. Yes, okay.

30:25.385 --> 30:26.986
There you go, yes, I did it.

30:27.114 --> 30:29.513
You're right, I did it.
I screwed her. You happy now?

30:29.641 --> 30:33.001
You win. Now, let her go.
Please.

30:33.128 --> 30:35.081
<i>Thank you.</i>

30:35.209 --> 30:37.928
<i>That wasn't so hard, was it?</i>

30:39.144 --> 30:41.064
You wanted me to confess,
I did.

30:41.193 --> 30:43.466
Now, what more
do you want me to do, huh?

30:44.009 --> 30:45.162
Let's get this over with.

30:45.290 --> 30:47.370
You're angry at me,
not them, all right?

30:47.496 --> 30:49.545
Me. Let them go,

30:49.672 --> 30:51.818
and we can settle this
between the two of us,
all right?

30:51.946 --> 30:54.408
<i>Ah, so now you have time
to listen to me.</i>

30:54.536 --> 30:57.257
The police want to talk to him.
No, no, that's okay.

30:57.384 --> 31:01.449
Gary, this can still
end well, okay?

31:02.569 --> 31:04.937
<i>But I don't want it
to end well.</i>

31:05.672 --> 31:07.688
<i>It didn't end well for Lauren.</i>

31:08.234 --> 31:09.194
For who? Who?

31:09.321 --> 31:11.784
<i>And you have the balls
to ask me who.</i>

31:12.329 --> 31:13.737
<i>Don't you know a Lauren?</i>

31:14.697 --> 31:17.352
First it's Mary,
now you're talking
about some Lauren.

31:17.481 --> 31:18.729
I know a dozen Laurens.

31:18.857 --> 31:21.128
<i>Oh, I bet you know
about a dozen Laurens.</i>

31:21.256 --> 31:23.176
<i>But to me there's only one.</i>

31:25.993 --> 31:27.848
Gary, you're gonna
have to help me here, I...

31:27.977 --> 31:29.865
They want to
take over the negotiation.

31:29.993 --> 31:32.074
They want you to hang up.
It's okay, Steven.

31:32.201 --> 31:34.728
Please, let my wife
and daughter go,

31:34.857 --> 31:37.096
and then we can talk about,
like, whatever you want.

31:37.225 --> 31:39.721
Okay? We'll sit here
and we'll work this out.

31:39.850 --> 31:43.240
<i>I'm sorry, that's not
the ending I had in mind.</i>

31:45.609 --> 31:46.697
<i>Wonder.</i>

31:49.641 --> 31:51.720
What? W-Wonder what?

31:51.848 --> 31:53.897
<i>Wonder, Lauren Wonder!</i>

31:54.023 --> 31:55.943
<i>That's her name!</i>

31:56.073 --> 31:58.857
<i>And she's also the eighth
wonder of the world.</i>

31:58.984 --> 32:02.472
<i>But I bet you didn't even know
her last name, did you?</i>

32:04.296 --> 32:06.698
Before me. Before me.

32:07.528 --> 32:08.360
Oh.

32:08.488 --> 32:10.889
Oh, the switchboard operator.
Lily.

32:11.016 --> 32:13.288
Her real name was Lauren.
We called her Lily.

32:13.417 --> 32:14.730
I didn't know her last name.

32:14.855 --> 32:16.329
<i>There you go.</i>

32:16.457 --> 32:19.497
<i>It's funny how
it all comes rushing back.</i>

32:19.625 --> 32:21.672
Yeah. She worked for us
a couple months.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.720
Uh, two years back.
She disappeared one day.

32:23.847 --> 32:25.801
We never saw her again.
I didn't know her last name.

32:25.929 --> 32:28.392
<i>That didn't stop you from
making stupid jokes about her</i>

32:28.521 --> 32:30.344
<i>every day on the show!</i>

32:30.472 --> 32:32.264
<i>About her face, her voice.</i>

32:32.392 --> 32:33.640
<i>She didn't dare speak up</i>

32:33.769 --> 32:36.362
<i>because Mr. Big Wig
is the star of radio.</i>

32:36.489 --> 32:38.377
<i>She thought that,
by leaving after five months,</i>

32:38.505 --> 32:40.744
<i>she'd be able to forget,
but no!</i>

32:40.871 --> 32:43.273
<i>Because people never stopped
talking about it to her.</i>

32:43.401 --> 32:45.001
<i>I've been with her
since high school.</i>

32:45.129 --> 32:46.664
<i>And yes,
she had other problems,</i>

32:46.791 --> 32:49.833
<i>but you, you were
the fucking cherry on top!</i>

32:49.960 --> 32:53.447
<i>It was always like
a pressure cooker, and boom!</i>

32:53.993 --> 32:56.104
Boom what? It's shock radio.

32:56.232 --> 32:58.537
We fuck around.
That's what we do.
We make jokes, okay?

32:58.664 --> 33:02.344
<i>It's not for you to decide
what's funny and what's not!</i>

33:02.472 --> 33:05.544
<i>See, being at
your fuckin' house with Olivia
and your daughter,</i>

33:05.671 --> 33:07.273
<i>now that's funny, oh, yeah.</i>

33:07.400 --> 33:08.615
Yeah, okay, all right.

33:08.744 --> 33:11.176
Look, I'll do anything
to help Lily-- Lauren.

33:11.304 --> 33:12.519
I'll make it up to her.

33:12.647 --> 33:14.663
<i>There is something you can do.</i>

33:14.793 --> 33:16.327
<i>You can take your wireless mic</i>

33:16.455 --> 33:18.343
<i>and go up
to the studio's terrace</i>

33:18.471 --> 33:20.552
<i>with someone
from your shitty team.</i>

33:21.160 --> 33:22.472
I... I don't get it.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.488
<i>You'll get it
when you're up there.</i>

33:24.616 --> 33:26.791
<i>Now, move your ass!
Okay, okay, calm down.</i>

33:26.920 --> 33:28.967
Mary, get a mic
and a headphone ready.

33:29.097 --> 33:30.599
Okay?

33:36.200 --> 33:37.607
We're coming with you.

33:37.737 --> 33:38.920
Okay.

33:41.351 --> 33:42.536
Let's go.

33:54.312 --> 33:55.336
Okay, I'm here.

33:55.464 --> 33:57.927
<i>Cool. Breathe.</i>

33:58.056 --> 33:59.495
Okay, just tell me
what you want

33:59.624 --> 34:00.968
so we can get this
over with, huh?

34:01.095 --> 34:03.399
<i>You see that ashtray
by the wall?</i>

34:05.191 --> 34:07.657
How do you know there's
an ashtray by the wall, Gary?

34:07.784 --> 34:11.401
<i>That's where Lauren came to cry
after you humiliated her.</i>

34:12.999 --> 34:13.959
She tell you that?

34:14.087 --> 34:15.624
<i>No, I was there.</i>

34:15.750 --> 34:16.966
Okay.

34:17.096 --> 34:20.040
<i>I was having a smoke
when she showed up in tears.</i>

34:20.775 --> 34:22.152
How'd you even
get in the building?

34:22.280 --> 34:24.903
<i>I worked there for my job.</i>

34:25.032 --> 34:28.680
<i>Oh, Elvis,
we met so many times,
and you never said hello.</i>

34:28.808 --> 34:30.984
<i>But hey, you treat
your own colleagues like dirt.</i>

34:31.143 --> 34:33.990
<i>It's no surprise you never
gave me the time of day.</i>

34:34.441 --> 34:35.239
Who are you?

34:35.368 --> 34:37.127
<i>Does it really matter?</i>

34:39.496 --> 34:42.598
Are you Gary Harlowe?

34:43.304 --> 34:44.614
<i>Not anymore.</i>

34:44.743 --> 34:46.056
What does that mean?

34:46.184 --> 34:48.008
<i>It means tonight
I don't give a fuck.</i>

34:49.095 --> 34:51.176
<i>I'm not that friendly
security guard anymore</i>

34:51.303 --> 34:53.128
<i>who always greeted you
with a smile.</i>

34:54.151 --> 34:57.126
Man, look, I am really sorry.
I just don't remember, okay?

34:57.255 --> 35:00.264
<i>Anyway, what I want you
to do now</i>

35:00.391 --> 35:03.080
<i>is to climb up onto that wall.</i>

35:03.208 --> 35:05.128
<i>I set up a little staircase
for you.</i>

35:06.983 --> 35:08.040
You can't be serious.

35:08.168 --> 35:09.800
<i>Does it sound like I'm joking?</i>

35:09.927 --> 35:12.999
<i>Hey, Adria, does it look
like I'm fooling around?</i>

35:13.128 --> 35:15.302
<i>Do I make you laugh, kid?</i>

35:15.430 --> 35:16.583
<i>Elvis!</i>

35:16.712 --> 35:18.855
<i>Relax. Everything's fine.</i>

35:18.984 --> 35:22.567
<i>Elvis is gonna get up
onto that fucking wall.</i>

35:41.575 --> 35:42.567
Fuck!

35:50.503 --> 35:53.255
I'm on the wall.
You happy? What now?

35:53.383 --> 35:54.823
<i>Thank you.</i>

35:55.528 --> 35:56.710
Gary, I don't like heights.

35:56.840 --> 35:58.502
You can tell Lauren
I'm shit scared

35:58.630 --> 36:00.486
if you think it makes you
feel any better, okay?

36:00.615 --> 36:02.342
<i>Well, that won't be easy,</i>

36:03.560 --> 36:05.190
<i>because she's dead.</i>

36:06.567 --> 36:08.647
<i>She committed suicide
a month ago.</i>

36:08.775 --> 36:11.142
<i>You should see
what she writes about you
in her letter.</i>

36:11.271 --> 36:13.095
<i>It's not very nice.</i>

36:13.223 --> 36:15.592
<i>She jumped
from her apartment balcony.</i>

36:15.718 --> 36:17.127
<i>Five stories.</i>

36:18.215 --> 36:20.871
Gary, I'm sorry.
Man, I'm really sorry.

36:20.999 --> 36:22.279
I've learned my lesson.

36:22.407 --> 36:24.967
Can we please stop
this nonsense?

36:25.094 --> 36:26.918
<i>When I came back
from Afghanistan,</i>

36:27.047 --> 36:28.455
<i>I tried to kill myself too.</i>

36:28.583 --> 36:31.109
<i>A pussy like you
wouldn't last a day over there.</i>

36:31.238 --> 36:33.511
<i>They said I was
psychologically damaged.</i>

36:33.638 --> 36:35.400
<i>Bullshit.
Gary, life is beautiful.</i>

36:35.527 --> 36:37.543
<i>No, it's not!</i>

36:37.671 --> 36:39.943
<i>Now, I want you to jump.</i>

36:47.525 --> 36:50.534
Come on, Gary,
nobody would do that.
I'm not gonna jump.

36:50.662 --> 36:52.358
<i>If you don't jump,
I'll kill them.</i>

36:52.486 --> 36:53.991
<i>You know I will!</i>

36:54.118 --> 36:55.782
<i>It's you or them!</i>

36:55.911 --> 36:58.118
Oh, for fuck sake, Gary,
can't we sort this out?

36:58.247 --> 36:59.558
Come on,
I'm begging you, please.

36:59.687 --> 37:01.159
<i>Jump!</i>

37:04.805 --> 37:06.183
I can't.

37:08.358 --> 37:09.926
<i>I knew it.</i>

37:10.055 --> 37:11.366
<i>I knew it.</i>

37:11.493 --> 37:13.510
<i>I knew you'd shit your pants.</i>

37:13.639 --> 37:15.719
<i>Not even a shred of dignity.</i>

37:15.847 --> 37:18.406
<i>That's why I didn't want you
to go alone.</i>

37:18.854 --> 37:22.022
<i>Dylan, push him.</i>

37:22.566 --> 37:23.495
No.

37:23.622 --> 37:25.478
<i>Push him,
or a five-year-old dies.</i>

37:25.606 --> 37:27.141
Gary, you sick fuck!

37:27.270 --> 37:30.278
I hope you die
and burn forever!

37:30.406 --> 37:31.879
<i>Last chance, Dylan.</i>

37:33.126 --> 37:34.630
<i>Push him!
No.</i>

37:34.759 --> 37:36.262
It's okay, it's okay.

37:36.389 --> 37:38.534
Gary, I'll jump.

37:39.365 --> 37:40.358
Put my wife on.

37:40.486 --> 37:42.181
What are you doing?

37:44.422 --> 37:46.374
I'm so sorry, my dear.

37:47.495 --> 37:48.838
I love you.

37:49.702 --> 37:50.885
Take care of Adria.

37:51.014 --> 37:53.126
Okay?

37:53.254 --> 37:54.278
I have no choice.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.070
<i>No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!</i>

37:56.198 --> 37:58.342
<i>Please, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you, please.</i>

37:58.469 --> 37:59.654
<i>Please!</i>

38:04.486 --> 38:05.735
Don't, Elvis, no!

38:22.021 --> 38:25.478
<i>Tell me, Dylan,
did that asshole jump?</i>

38:25.861 --> 38:26.790
Yes.

38:28.645 --> 38:31.654
<i>Thank you, Dylan.</i>

38:31.781 --> 38:35.014
<i>Hey, listen, I'm sorry
I put you in that situation.</i>

38:35.142 --> 38:37.190
<i>I did you a favor, though.
That guy would
have tortured you,</i>

38:37.318 --> 38:38.534
<i>just like he did to Lauren.</i>

38:38.661 --> 38:40.550
<i>He was a real
son of a bitch, you know.</i>

38:40.676 --> 38:41.958
You can free his wife
and daughter

38:42.086 --> 38:44.487
because he jumped,
he's dead.

38:44.613 --> 38:45.765
Just let them go.

38:45.894 --> 38:48.805
<i>Of course.
I'm a man of my word.</i>

38:50.214 --> 38:51.654
<i>I just...</i>

38:51.781 --> 38:54.598
<i>I just need proof
that he really jumped.</i>

38:55.558 --> 38:57.061
<i>I mean, you wouldn't
lie to me, right?</i>

38:57.190 --> 38:59.590
I'm telling you, he jumped.
Just let them go.

39:22.022 --> 39:24.325
<i>How could you do this to me?</i>

39:24.454 --> 39:27.525
<i>You filthy liars!
You're all motherfuckers!</i>

39:28.517 --> 39:30.277
<i>Dylan, you've really
disappointed me.</i>

39:30.405 --> 39:33.221
No, wait, don't get angry.
I can explain, okay?

39:33.349 --> 39:36.997
<i>I wanted to film Elvis's jump
and post it online.</i>

39:37.125 --> 39:39.045
<i>You've really
made a fool out of me.</i>

39:39.173 --> 39:40.614
Hey, hey, Gary,
this is my fault.

39:40.741 --> 39:42.469
<i>I apologize, okay?
It's too late!</i>

39:42.598 --> 39:44.710
<i>I'm sorry.
An eye for an eye, Elvis.</i>

39:44.837 --> 39:49.285
<i>Gary...
Now you can see what it's like
to lose someone you love.</i>

39:49.413 --> 39:51.557
The police is ready to go.
They're headed in!

39:51.686 --> 39:53.060
Gary, the cops
are coming in right now.

39:53.189 --> 39:55.940
I'm begging you, please!
Give it up! Stop it!

40:57.700 --> 40:58.981
Wait.

41:00.037 --> 41:02.149
The police want
to get you on the phone.

41:05.668 --> 41:07.013
Yeah?

41:10.373 --> 41:11.717
What?

41:13.221 --> 41:14.660
Uh...

41:19.941 --> 41:21.604
That can't be.

41:27.973 --> 41:30.020
Go with him.
I'll lock up the studio.

41:58.244 --> 41:59.268
It's impossible.

41:59.428 --> 42:01.028
What's going on?

42:02.468 --> 42:04.196
The cops say...

42:05.604 --> 42:07.684
- there's no one home.
- What?

42:09.092 --> 42:11.043
They checked every room.

42:11.172 --> 42:12.580
No signs of forced entry.

42:12.710 --> 42:14.340
The dogs are alive.

42:14.851 --> 42:15.876
I don't get it.

42:16.003 --> 42:18.372
And your daughter,
your... your wife?

42:18.501 --> 42:19.556
Not there.

42:19.684 --> 42:21.381
I don't know.

42:21.508 --> 42:23.460
They looked everywhere.
Nothing.

42:25.124 --> 42:26.372
<i>Ha-ha-ha...</i>

42:26.501 --> 42:28.101
<i>♪ Elvis ♪</i>

42:28.228 --> 42:30.276

42:33.060 --> 42:34.404

42:34.533 --> 42:36.036
He's back.

42:37.156 --> 42:38.947
Turn up the volume.

42:44.164 --> 42:46.115
<i>♪ Elvis ♪</i>

43:40.005 --> 43:43.748
<i>Elvis,
you play footsie with me,
I play better.</i>

43:43.876 --> 43:45.283
<i>One step ahead, buddy.</i>

43:45.411 --> 43:47.845
<i>I really had you convinced I
was at your place, didn't I?</i>

43:47.971 --> 43:51.267
<i>And those Keystone Cops
who broke down your door
for nothing,</i>

43:51.395 --> 43:53.091
<i>what a bunch of idiots.</i>

43:54.179 --> 43:56.003
Is he the one
who killed the guard?

43:57.187 --> 43:59.907
<i>Now, the show's
really getting started.</i>

44:00.034 --> 44:02.116
<i>So I lied about
being at your house,</i>

44:02.244 --> 44:04.516
<i>but I am with your family.</i>

44:05.411 --> 44:07.395
<i>Elvis, get out of here!</i>

44:07.523 --> 44:09.219
<i>"Elvis, get out of here!"</i>

44:09.347 --> 44:12.995
<i>She doesn't
even seem to resent you
for cheating on her.</i>

44:13.123 --> 44:14.435
<i>Now, that is devotion.</i>

44:14.564 --> 44:17.347
<i>I caught them
just as you left home.</i>

44:17.476 --> 44:21.730
<i>By the way, Olivia and Adria
did not want to
get into my car.</i>

44:21.858 --> 44:23.107
<i>It was a struggle.</i>

44:23.236 --> 44:25.156
<i>Kind of like rassling
a couple of piglets.</i>

44:27.651 --> 44:29.315
<i>They fought, they squealed.</i>

44:29.443 --> 44:32.483
<i>But I managed to tame them
in the end.</i>

44:34.563 --> 44:36.035
<i>Hey, Elvis, you there?</i>

44:37.283 --> 44:38.435
<i>Elvis?</i>

44:38.563 --> 44:39.875
<i>Yoo-hoo?</i>

44:40.355 --> 44:41.762
<i>Anybody out there?</i>

44:42.915 --> 44:46.083
<i>You're kidding me.
Am I all alone on the air?</i>

44:46.211 --> 44:49.252
<i>Wow, this is like
a childhood fantasy come true.</i>

44:49.379 --> 44:51.843
<i>But hey, Elvis, I do hope you
can still hear me out there</i>

44:51.971 --> 44:54.179
<i>'cause tonight,
as a tribute to Lauren,</i>

44:54.307 --> 44:56.804
<i>I've gone out of my way
to make sure you spend</i>

44:56.931 --> 44:59.363
<i>the worst night of your life.</i>

44:59.491 --> 45:01.123
<i>See, I've created a game,</i>

45:01.251 --> 45:02.786
<i>and I think you're
gonna love it.</i>

45:02.915 --> 45:04.067
<i>The rules are simple.</i>

45:04.195 --> 45:07.811
<i>If you lose,
I kill these two little ladies.</i>

45:10.722 --> 45:13.060
Use your cell.
Let's call the cops.

45:13.891 --> 45:16.354
<i>Elvis. I'm gonna count
down from 30.</i>

45:16.482 --> 45:19.011
<i>If you don't answer,
that means you've gone,</i>

45:19.139 --> 45:21.314
<i>and that I'm talking
to myself like a madman.</i>

45:21.442 --> 45:23.266
<i>I'm not crazy, you know?</i>

45:23.395 --> 45:26.595
<i>So listen,
if you don't get back
on the line,</i>

45:26.724 --> 45:27.684
<i>the game is over,</i>

45:27.810 --> 45:29.154
<i>and if the game is over,</i>

45:29.282 --> 45:31.043
<i>boom, boom.</i>

45:31.170 --> 45:33.730
<i>Thirty, 29...</i>

45:33.858 --> 45:36.963
Gary, it's Mary.

45:37.090 --> 45:38.755
Elvis has left the building...

45:38.883 --> 45:41.795
<i>No one called you,
Miss America.
I'm playing with Elvis.</i>

45:41.924 --> 45:44.194
<i>I don't talk to women
who sleep with married men.</i>

45:44.322 --> 45:46.724
<i>Either Elvis
is there or he's not.</i>

45:46.851 --> 45:48.226
<i>Anyway, where was I?</i>

45:48.866 --> 45:51.779
<i>Twenty-eight, 27...</i>

45:52.611 --> 45:55.842
<i>26, 25...</i>

45:56.419 --> 45:59.107
<i>24, 23...</i>

46:00.067 --> 46:03.362
<i>22, 21...</i>

46:04.003 --> 46:07.522
<i>20, 19...</i>

46:07.651 --> 46:10.819
<i>18, 17...</i>

46:10.945 --> 46:14.659
<i>16, 15...</i>

46:14.785 --> 46:17.057
<i>14, 13...</i>

46:17.186 --> 46:19.682
<i>Elvis, the...
12, 11...</i>

46:19.810 --> 46:21.921
<i>...mic is in the elevator.
ten...</i>

46:22.050 --> 46:23.937
<i>nine, eight...</i>

46:24.994 --> 46:27.618
<i>seven, six...</i>

46:28.290 --> 46:31.074
<i>five, four...</i>

46:31.201 --> 46:32.354
<i>three...</i>

46:32.482 --> 46:34.466
<i>two...</i>

46:34.594 --> 46:36.194
<i>one...</i>

46:36.322 --> 46:37.634
<i>Zero!</i>

46:37.763 --> 46:39.459
I'm here! I'm here!

46:39.587 --> 46:42.307
<i>Ah! Okay, Elvis.</i>

46:43.299 --> 46:44.609
<i>And he's back!</i>

46:47.681 --> 46:49.505
<i>Were you taking a dump?</i>

46:50.243 --> 46:52.577
<i>So, where are you, my friend?</i>

46:52.706 --> 46:53.697
In reception.

46:53.827 --> 46:54.722
<i>Oh, in reception.</i>

46:54.850 --> 46:56.194
<i>Ha!</i>

46:57.602 --> 47:00.355
<i>Sorry I didn't have time
to clean up the entrance.</i>

47:00.482 --> 47:02.018
Yeah, did you
have to kill him?

47:02.146 --> 47:04.578
<i>Yes, I did.
That guard was very impolite.</i>

47:04.705 --> 47:05.986
<i>Not friendly at all.</i>

47:06.114 --> 47:08.259
<i>I told him I used to work
the same job.</i>

47:08.386 --> 47:10.147
<i>He didn't want to open
the door at first,</i>

47:10.274 --> 47:12.801
<i>but thank God
he recognized your wife,
so he let us in.</i>

47:12.931 --> 47:14.369
<i>Didn't seem to like
my face, though.</i>

47:14.498 --> 47:15.939
<i>He didn't want
to give me a badge.</i>

47:16.067 --> 47:17.634
<i>What a jerk.</i>

47:18.369 --> 47:19.970
So now it's your turn.
Where are you?

47:20.098 --> 47:21.602
<i>I'll let you in on a secret.</i>

47:21.730 --> 47:23.938
<i>I'm still at your home,
in a way.</i>

47:24.066 --> 47:25.921
<i>I wasn't exactly
lying to you earlier.</i>

47:26.050 --> 47:27.201
<i>I'm at your home.</i>

47:27.330 --> 47:30.370
<i>This is your second home,
after all.</i>

47:30.498 --> 47:33.249
<i>We're gonna have some fun.</i>

47:33.378 --> 47:36.609
<i>Dear listeners,
you're about to hear
the last 40 minutes</i>

47:36.737 --> 47:38.914
<i>in the history of Elvis's show.</i>

47:39.042 --> 47:41.762
<i>In 40 minutes, that's 4-0...</i>

47:42.113 --> 47:43.778
<i>boom!</i>

47:48.161 --> 47:51.394
You're gonna blow up the door.
Why?

47:51.522 --> 47:53.474
<i>The door?</i>

47:53.603 --> 47:56.162
<i>No. I respect your show, Elvis.</i>

47:56.290 --> 47:58.721
<i>It deserves some sparkle.</i>

47:58.850 --> 48:01.026
<i>You should check
your social media.</i>

48:01.569 --> 48:03.233
<i>Man, I'm excited.</i>

48:03.361 --> 48:06.209
<i>In the army,
I was an explosive ordnance
disposal specialist.</i>

48:06.337 --> 48:08.993
<i>I miss fireworks.</i>

48:12.960 --> 48:14.241
He's gonna blow everything up.

48:14.370 --> 48:16.993
Windows, the door,
the basement, the garage.

48:17.121 --> 48:18.849
Everything is wired to blow.

48:18.976 --> 48:21.954
<i>If only Lauren could see this.</i>

48:22.082 --> 48:23.809
<i>On the other hand,
she'd probably tell me</i>

48:23.937 --> 48:25.505
<i>just to blow it all up
right away.</i>

48:25.634 --> 48:27.042
<i>She didn't like to play games,</i>

48:27.170 --> 48:28.545
<i>but you never understood that.</i>

48:28.674 --> 48:30.369
Seems like
a lot of work, Gary.

48:30.497 --> 48:32.289
How'd you set all that up?

48:32.417 --> 48:35.073
<i>I could have
done it better, trust me.
I didn't have much time.</i>

48:35.201 --> 48:36.450
<i>Should do the trick anyway.</i>

48:36.577 --> 48:37.920
<i>With a bit of luck,
the explosions</i>

48:38.049 --> 48:40.514
<i>will bring down
this whole building.</i>

48:40.929 --> 48:42.592
Elvis.

48:43.873 --> 48:45.249
I don't wanna die here.

48:45.378 --> 48:48.577
Well, if we don't wanna die,
we gotta fight.

48:49.377 --> 48:51.042
He's in the building.
We can get him.

48:51.170 --> 48:52.674
You hear that, Gary?

48:52.801 --> 48:54.690
<i>He's right, Dylan, really.</i>

48:54.817 --> 48:58.080
<i>I said it was a game,
and I'm gonna follow the rules.</i>

48:58.209 --> 48:59.809
<i>Military code of honor.</i>

48:59.937 --> 49:01.185
<i>You have a chance.</i>

49:01.314 --> 49:03.682
<i>If you find me,
I won't blow up the building.</i>

49:03.808 --> 49:05.025
<i>I'll let you go,</i>

49:05.154 --> 49:07.744
<i>and I'll just kill Elvis.</i>

49:07.873 --> 49:11.810
Well, then show yourself,
you slippery son of a bitch!

49:13.026 --> 49:14.400
Let my girls go, okay?

49:14.528 --> 49:17.248
You don't need 'em.
They're just a liability
for you.

49:17.376 --> 49:18.496
It's just you and me.
Man up.

49:18.625 --> 49:20.737
If you're a real man,
come down here,

49:20.866 --> 49:22.145
duke it out with me, okay?

49:22.272 --> 49:23.713
We'll settle this!

49:23.842 --> 49:26.913
I'm too old to play fuckin'
hide-and-seek, all right?

49:27.937 --> 49:29.249
<i>Are you done?</i>

49:30.562 --> 49:32.066
<i>I don't think you get it.</i>

49:32.193 --> 49:35.042
<i>Instead of wasting your time
talking shit,</i>

49:35.168 --> 49:38.721
<i>why don't you try to find me
and save your family?</i>

49:39.873 --> 49:43.650
All right, we'll do it
the fuckin' hard way.

50:16.129 --> 50:17.952
<i>This could have made
a great movie.</i>

50:18.081 --> 50:20.673
<i>"The bad guy's hiding
somewhere in the building,</i>

50:20.799 --> 50:22.496
<i>the good guy
is looking for him.</i>

50:22.624 --> 50:24.065
<i>And then they all blow up!</i>

50:24.193 --> 50:25.249
<i>The end."</i>

50:25.376 --> 50:26.977
<i>What do you think?</i>

50:27.105 --> 50:28.865
I think you need a rewrite.

50:29.505 --> 50:31.554
Sounds like a real stinker.

51:14.559 --> 51:16.319
What's the fuck's going on?

51:16.447 --> 51:18.624
Come on. Ton...

51:19.553 --> 51:21.312
Tony? What the hell is this?

51:21.440 --> 51:22.943
What, you know him?

51:23.072 --> 51:25.120
Yes. It's Tony.
He's been working here
for 20 years.

51:25.248 --> 51:27.328
I didn't know it was you,
Mr. Elvis. I'm sorry.

51:27.456 --> 51:30.783
What the hell got into you,
attacking him like that?
I don't know him!

51:30.913 --> 51:32.929
You know,
I couldn't see shit.

51:33.056 --> 51:35.200
I just saw the dead guard
at the entrance.

51:35.776 --> 51:37.120
So I hid in the dark.

51:37.248 --> 51:39.841
And when you guys came in,
I just jumped on the first guy.

51:39.968 --> 51:43.295
What if he works for Gary
and he's lying because
he couldn't take me out?

51:43.424 --> 51:45.215
Out of the question,
I've known this guy
since forever.

51:45.344 --> 51:46.560
When you guys came in,

51:46.688 --> 51:49.184
I just assumed
you were part of his team.

51:49.312 --> 51:50.079
Whose team?

51:50.208 --> 51:51.648
The fucking crazy guy's team.

51:51.776 --> 51:54.304
The guy that came around
with the woman
and the little girl?

51:55.809 --> 51:57.793
Elvis, I couldn't see anything.

51:57.919 --> 51:59.360
It was super dark.
It was fuzzy.

51:59.487 --> 52:01.375
Yeah, but I do remember
he was wearing a hat.

52:01.503 --> 52:02.880
That I do.

52:03.904 --> 52:06.720
And his eyes.
I could never forget his eyes.

52:06.847 --> 52:11.135
I mean, he... this guy looks
as if he just escaped
a fucking mental asylum.

52:11.264 --> 52:13.760
I mean, he's totally cuckoo.

52:13.886 --> 52:15.552
Why the hell didn't you
get out of here?

52:15.681 --> 52:17.120
I did, I tried...

52:17.248 --> 52:21.184
I-I... I tried to leave
through the parking lot area,

52:21.312 --> 52:24.127
just to find that it was
full with explosives.

52:24.256 --> 52:26.688
A whole door--
I mean, the whole building
for that matter,

52:26.815 --> 52:30.719
it's filled with explosives,
I mean, just, you know...

52:32.288 --> 52:34.047
What's going on, Elvis?
I mean, come on.

52:34.176 --> 52:35.232
Are we all going to die?

52:35.360 --> 52:37.215
<i>I am loving this.</i>

52:37.344 --> 52:39.680
<i>What a shit show!
You okay, Elvis?</i>

52:39.838 --> 52:41.152
<i>Little Dylan
still in one piece?</i>

52:41.280 --> 52:43.392
<i>I hadn't planned
on Tony showing up.</i>

52:43.520 --> 52:45.598
<i>Tony, my man! I remember you.</i>

52:45.727 --> 52:46.815
<i>What a nice guy.</i>

52:46.944 --> 52:48.383
Well, apparently
I'm getting warmer.

52:48.510 --> 52:50.399
You went by here
recently too, huh?

52:50.527 --> 52:52.096
<i>Hold on a second, though.</i>

52:52.223 --> 52:55.487
<i>It's no fair
if Tony's joining your team
all of a sudden.</i>

52:55.615 --> 52:57.727
Is he talking into
your headphones right now?

52:58.336 --> 52:59.551
What's he saying?

52:59.680 --> 53:01.344
<i>There's no room
for an extra player.</i>

53:01.471 --> 53:02.846
<i>Kill him.</i>

53:04.670 --> 53:06.304
<i>Kill that son of a bitch.</i>

53:06.431 --> 53:08.160
I'm not killing anybody.

53:08.288 --> 53:10.656
Tony will sit in a corner
and he won't say
another fucking word, okay?

53:10.783 --> 53:11.968
He's not coming with us.

53:12.096 --> 53:14.366
<i>No, Tony wasn't
part of my plan.</i>

53:14.496 --> 53:15.936
<i>He was supposed to clock out
at 10:00 p.m.</i>

53:16.064 --> 53:17.695
<i>What the hell's he still
doing here anyway?</i>

53:17.824 --> 53:20.158
You get out of here, walk away,
just get out of here.

53:20.287 --> 53:23.136
<i>No, that's not okay.
This is pissing me off, Elvis.</i>

53:23.263 --> 53:24.639
<i>Ask him what he's doing here.</i>

53:24.767 --> 53:26.846
Okay, he wants to know
what you're doing here,

53:26.976 --> 53:29.024
why you didn't leave
at 10:00 p.m.

53:31.103 --> 53:32.127
Me?

53:33.246 --> 53:35.486
You were supposed to leave
at 10:00 p.m., right?
Yeah.

53:35.616 --> 53:37.119
What the hell
are you still doing here?

53:37.247 --> 53:39.456
<i>This is fishy.
Uh...</i>

53:39.583 --> 53:42.174
<i>If he doesn't answer,
kill that son of a bitch.</i>

53:43.327 --> 53:45.117
I'll tell you.

53:46.271 --> 53:48.159
You know,
I finished my shift.

53:48.287 --> 53:49.951
There were some areas
that I had to finish,

53:50.078 --> 53:52.191
that I...
had to take care of,

53:52.319 --> 53:55.295
and-and I wanted to take a walk
around the office before I did.

53:55.424 --> 53:57.119
That's... That's it.

53:57.599 --> 53:58.623
You're lying.

53:58.752 --> 54:00.159
What's your problem?

54:00.287 --> 54:02.366
No, you tell me
what you're doing here.
Tell me now.

54:02.496 --> 54:04.415
Elvis--
What the fuck is up?
Tell me now!

54:04.543 --> 54:07.455
<i>Ah, now we got some action.
Elvis is getting angry.</i>

54:07.583 --> 54:11.071
No, wait. He's the guy
stealing the computers,

54:11.199 --> 54:12.958
the one you were
talking about on air.

54:13.087 --> 54:15.967
Tony?
You been stealing from us?

54:20.542 --> 54:22.206
I'm really sorry, Elvis.

54:23.070 --> 54:24.894
I really am.

54:25.023 --> 54:28.638
You see,
my wife is very sick
over in Spain, and...

54:28.767 --> 54:31.678
I need it desperately.
I needed the cash.

54:31.806 --> 54:34.463
I'm not doing anything wrong.
It's my cousin that sells them.

54:34.590 --> 54:37.439
I just give it to him.
He gives me a little cut
every time.

54:37.566 --> 54:40.223
But it's only the sales team's
computer that I take.

54:40.351 --> 54:43.678
I mean, I never ever
even dream of touching
one of yours, I swear.

54:43.807 --> 54:45.501
You gotta believe me.

54:45.630 --> 54:48.447
<i>We're not gonna let him
get away with this, Elvis,
are we?</i>

54:50.302 --> 54:51.966
<i>Ticktock.</i>

54:52.446 --> 54:53.790
<i>Ticktock!</i>

54:53.919 --> 54:55.743
<i>Ticktock, time is running out.</i>

54:55.870 --> 54:57.694
<i>Kill this fucking thief
and come find me.</i>

54:57.823 --> 55:00.703
Tony, go upstairs
and hide in the studio,
okay?

55:00.830 --> 55:02.239
W-We'll settle this later,
okay?

55:02.366 --> 55:04.350
Go on, pal, get outta here.
Thank you, Elvis.

55:04.478 --> 55:05.279
I owe you.

55:05.406 --> 55:07.581
<i>Elvis! What a mensch!</i>

55:07.711 --> 55:08.958
<i>A true hero.</i>

55:09.087 --> 55:10.622
<i>If it were me,
I'd have taken him out,</i>

55:10.751 --> 55:12.638
<i>but you, you are a class act.</i>

55:12.767 --> 55:16.606
<i>What Hollywood actor
do you think would play you
in the movie of our game, huh?</i>

55:16.734 --> 55:17.502
<i>Tom Cruise?</i>

55:17.631 --> 55:19.743
<i>I'd cast Joaquin Phoenix as me.</i>

55:19.870 --> 55:21.694
<i>Tonight, I'm kind of a joker.</i>

55:26.878 --> 55:29.855
"I have a condition!"

55:57.695 --> 56:00.029
<i>I like silence.</i>

56:04.286 --> 56:06.302
<i>Cold!</i>

56:12.414 --> 56:13.789
<i>Hot.</i>

56:17.854 --> 56:20.190
<i>I wouldn't go in there
if I were you.</i>

56:21.342 --> 56:23.902
<i>Getting warmer.</i>

56:28.446 --> 56:30.174
<i>Not in there.</i>

56:34.302 --> 56:35.582
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

56:35.709 --> 56:37.789
<i>This isn't supposed
to take all night.</i>

56:37.917 --> 56:41.854
<i>And since I'm a nice guy,
here's some help
from someone special.</i>

56:41.982 --> 56:43.294
<i>Go on, sweetie.</i>

56:43.423 --> 56:45.118
<i>Give Daddy a clue.</i>

56:46.142 --> 56:49.597
<i>Daddy, I'm in a closet
with some toys.</i>

56:49.726 --> 56:52.286
<i>Oh, now, that's too easy.</i>

57:07.870 --> 57:09.917
Hyah!

57:46.589 --> 57:48.029
It's Adria's.

57:49.565 --> 57:51.614
He's doing this
to drive you crazy.

57:51.741 --> 57:53.949
<i>Now, isn't that cute?</i>

57:54.077 --> 57:55.870
<i>Dear listeners,
let me set the scene.</i>

57:55.997 --> 57:59.133
<i>Shock jock Elvis clutching
a plush toy covered in blood,</i>

57:59.261 --> 58:02.365
<i>and newbie Dylan who looks
like he's about to lose it.</i>

58:02.494 --> 58:03.806
<i>And see,
from where I'm sitting,</i>

58:03.933 --> 58:06.812
<i>I'm lucky enough
to watch the whole scene.</i>

58:17.885 --> 58:19.965
He's been watching us
from the start.

58:20.093 --> 58:21.789
I know where the son
of a bitch is hiding.

58:21.916 --> 58:23.901
He can only be
in the camera room
in the basement.

58:24.028 --> 58:25.630
Okay, so let's call
the police to save time.

58:25.756 --> 58:27.325
We don't have the luxury
of time.

58:27.454 --> 58:28.700
He's a madman.

58:28.828 --> 58:30.716
I've dealt with kooks
like this for 30 years.

58:30.844 --> 58:32.445
He's the type
to go through with it.

58:32.573 --> 58:36.381
He'll kill my girls
unless we stop him. Okay?

58:36.509 --> 58:40.029
By the time the cops get here,
fuck, it's hopeless.

58:40.157 --> 58:42.269
He just wants
to knock everyone off
and then do himself.

58:42.397 --> 58:45.342
We don't stand a chance.
This won't end well.
No.

58:45.469 --> 58:48.093
<i>Elvis, no secret powwows.</i>

58:48.222 --> 58:49.564
<i>Turn your mic back on.</i>

58:49.692 --> 58:51.453
Listen, you don't have
to come with me,

58:51.580 --> 58:53.245
but I think it's safer
if we stick together.

58:53.373 --> 58:55.420
I know a way
where there's no cameras.

58:55.549 --> 58:57.628
We can sneak up on him
in the basement.

58:59.261 --> 59:01.532
<i>Elvis,
think about your listeners.</i>

59:01.662 --> 59:03.645
<i>We are live on the air!</i>

59:03.773 --> 59:05.340
<i>Turn your microphone back on.</i>

59:05.469 --> 59:06.749
Okay, I'll play.

59:07.965 --> 59:10.270
I'll bet you're somewhere
in the upper floors, am I right?

59:10.397 --> 59:12.540
<i>Maybe.</i>

59:12.669 --> 59:14.556
Yeah, I'm comin', numb nuts.

59:49.052 --> 59:51.035
Stop! Wait!

59:53.405 --> 59:54.908
Hang on.

59:56.413 --> 59:58.780
We have to hurry.
There's no camera down here.

59:58.908 --> 1:00:00.573
He'll be looking for us
on the other side

1:00:00.700 --> 1:00:02.300
and realize we're not there.
Come on.

1:00:02.428 --> 1:00:06.077
<i>Hey, guys,
you're supposed to find me,
remember,</i>

1:00:06.204 --> 1:00:08.380
<i>not the other way around.</i>

1:00:08.509 --> 1:00:11.100
<i>But, hey, I'm not against
spicing things up.</i>

1:00:11.228 --> 1:00:13.084
<i>Come on, give me a clue.</i>

1:00:14.012 --> 1:00:16.380
<i>♪ Elvis ♪</i>

1:00:18.268 --> 1:00:23.100
Hey, Gary, I'm coming
upstairs to find ya,
you sick puke.

1:00:30.268 --> 1:00:31.868
There's the security cameras
in that room.

1:00:31.997 --> 1:00:33.212
He's in there.

1:00:33.821 --> 1:00:36.540
<i>Where are you hiding?</i>

1:00:57.180 --> 1:00:59.228
One, two...

1:00:59.356 --> 1:01:00.316
Go!

1:01:00.443 --> 1:01:03.196
All right.
Turn around or I'll brain ya.

1:01:15.901 --> 1:01:19.099
You son of a bitch!

1:01:19.227 --> 1:01:23.035
<i>Did you really think
I'd be in there when I can
hack into any camera?</i>

1:01:23.164 --> 1:01:24.508
<i>I have a knack for computers.</i>

1:01:24.636 --> 1:01:27.259
<i>And frankly, breaking into
a 25-year-old security system</i>

1:01:27.388 --> 1:01:30.044
<i>was easier than stealing
my sister's Netflix password.</i>

1:01:30.171 --> 1:01:33.083
<i>I've got all the cameras
right here on a tablet.</i>

1:01:36.891 --> 1:01:38.715
<i>Elvis.</i>

1:01:38.844 --> 1:01:40.443
Yoo-hoo!

1:01:44.315 --> 1:01:46.395
<i>Oh, hey, you're welcome,
by the way.</i>

1:01:47.099 --> 1:01:50.011
<i>Uh, Elvis, yoo-hoo!</i>

1:01:50.139 --> 1:01:52.283
<i>What an ingrate.
You could at least thank me.</i>

1:01:52.412 --> 1:01:55.899
<i>Thank you for what?
Well, you never liked
that asshole Justin, did you?</i>

1:01:56.027 --> 1:01:58.748
<i>This will make it easier for
you to get his 8:00 p.m. slot.</i>

1:01:58.874 --> 1:02:01.532
<i>No more sleepless nights
talking to freaks.</i>

1:02:01.659 --> 1:02:03.579
<i>How come you don't look happy?</i>

1:02:03.708 --> 1:02:05.531
<i>Nothing's ever good enough
for you, is it?</i>

1:02:05.659 --> 1:02:07.163
Why don't you tell me
where you are

1:02:07.291 --> 1:02:09.692
so I can come
and thank you personally?

1:02:09.820 --> 1:02:11.323
<i>Nah, you can thank me later.</i>

1:02:11.451 --> 1:02:14.331
Knock it off, will ya?
Son of a bitch.

1:02:14.460 --> 1:02:16.508
<i>You're right, Elvis.
It's time for a break.</i>

1:02:16.637 --> 1:02:19.930
<i>And you know what?
There's something I've
always dreamed of doing.</i>

1:02:20.059 --> 1:02:25.052
<i>What's it like to swap places
with the king of radio?</i>

1:02:28.795 --> 1:02:30.012
<i>Ahh!</i>

1:02:30.138 --> 1:02:32.731
<i>Now I have a beautiful voice.</i>

1:02:35.740 --> 1:02:38.460
He's in the studio.
Oh, fuck. Mary. Steve.

1:02:38.587 --> 1:02:39.898
Go!

1:02:41.851 --> 1:02:43.867
<i>Dear listeners,
you have a new host tonight,</i>

1:02:43.995 --> 1:02:45.594
<i>and it's about time.</i>

1:02:45.722 --> 1:02:46.747
<i>Finally, someone loyal.</i>

1:02:46.874 --> 1:02:48.634
He's powered off
the elevators.

1:02:48.763 --> 1:02:52.506
<i>Oh, Elvis, I'm sorry.
The elevators seem
to be out of order.</i>

1:02:52.634 --> 1:02:54.715
<i>Just can't catch a break, huh?</i>

1:02:54.843 --> 1:02:55.867
Fuck.

1:02:55.996 --> 1:02:57.307
Mary?

1:02:57.434 --> 1:02:59.483
Guys. How you doing?
You okay?

1:02:59.611 --> 1:03:00.826
<i>"Mary?</i>

1:03:00.954 --> 1:03:02.907
<i>Guys, how you doing? You okay?"</i>

1:03:03.034 --> 1:03:05.818
<i>Seriously, what kind of
a two-bit operation is this?</i>

1:03:05.947 --> 1:03:07.546
<i>There's no one left
at the wheel.</i>

1:03:07.674 --> 1:03:09.051
<i>Thank God I showed up, right?</i>

1:03:09.180 --> 1:03:10.971
<i>Hey, we should redo
the jingles.</i>

1:03:11.100 --> 1:03:14.362
<i>"Gary, tonight, 'On the Line.'"</i>

1:03:14.491 --> 1:03:16.314
<i>I think it's gonna be a hit.</i>

1:03:16.442 --> 1:03:18.780
<i>Yeah, knock yourself out, buddy.
I'm on my way.</i>

1:03:18.907 --> 1:03:22.362
<i>Take your time, Elvis.
Just don't be late.</i>

1:03:22.907 --> 1:03:24.507
Thirteen minutes.

1:03:37.306 --> 1:03:38.554
It's loaded.

1:03:38.683 --> 1:03:41.019
I can't... I can't.

1:03:41.146 --> 1:03:42.394
Hey, Dylan, pull it together.

1:03:42.522 --> 1:03:44.700
You can't slack off now.
I need you, boy.

1:03:45.916 --> 1:03:48.379
Put down your weapon, now!

1:04:01.498 --> 1:04:05.177
Officer, this is
all a misunderstanding.

1:04:07.130 --> 1:04:09.178
Everything's fine.

1:04:09.306 --> 1:04:12.379
I don't have time to explain.
I gotta go upstairs.

1:04:12.507 --> 1:04:14.716
There's a madman up there
with my wife and daughter!

1:04:14.841 --> 1:04:16.698
I said
put down your weapons!

1:04:16.826 --> 1:04:18.331
It's Elvis.

1:04:19.515 --> 1:04:21.179
It's the radio star.

1:04:22.522 --> 1:04:24.442
You're gonna screw
everything up, Officer.

1:04:24.571 --> 1:04:26.394
I'm really sorry,
but I gotta go.

1:04:26.522 --> 1:04:27.866
Don't move!

1:04:28.955 --> 1:04:31.643
Dispatch,
I have two individuals,
one armed,

1:04:31.770 --> 1:04:33.882
at the bottom
of the KLAT-FM building.

1:04:34.010 --> 1:04:36.282
There's one man down.
Requesting backup.

1:04:36.411 --> 1:04:38.745
You haven't heard, or what?

1:04:38.873 --> 1:04:42.107
Why don't you call one
of your higher-IQ buddies
at the station?

1:04:42.235 --> 1:04:44.443
We're being attacked
by a madman.

1:04:44.569 --> 1:04:45.979
I'm not talkin' to you!

1:04:46.106 --> 1:04:48.283
You're gonna put down
that weapon.
I'm coming in.

1:04:48.410 --> 1:04:49.657
Don't. You can't come in.

1:04:51.450 --> 1:04:53.082
Oh, I'm coming in.

1:04:53.210 --> 1:04:54.842
Everything's gonna
be just fine.

1:04:54.971 --> 1:04:56.603
No, please, please don't.

1:05:00.953 --> 1:05:02.299
Don't-- Don't touch that door!

1:05:02.426 --> 1:05:04.761
- Put down your fuckin' weapons!
- Elvis!

1:05:06.299 --> 1:05:07.195
Do as he says.

1:05:07.322 --> 1:05:08.378
Huh?

1:05:08.505 --> 1:05:11.035
Okay, okay!
I'm putting it down.

1:05:19.610 --> 1:05:21.915
Back away from the door
or we all die!

1:05:22.042 --> 1:05:23.770
Shut up!

1:05:23.897 --> 1:05:25.530
<i>Officer Glen. Stand back.</i>

1:05:25.659 --> 1:05:29.338
<i>Do not enter the building.
I repeat, this is an order.</i>

1:05:29.466 --> 1:05:30.938
<i>Do not enter the building.</i>

1:05:31.067 --> 1:05:32.857
<i>Backup will arrive
in two minutes.</i>

1:05:32.987 --> 1:05:34.553
Copy that.
What should I do?

1:05:34.681 --> 1:05:36.058
<i>Nothing. You stay put.</i>

1:05:36.186 --> 1:05:37.946
<i>The situation
is extremely dangerous.</i>

1:05:38.074 --> 1:05:41.305
<i>Dispatch is handling it.
SWAT is on its way.</i>

1:06:05.081 --> 1:06:07.674
<i>Freeze! Stop moving!</i>

1:06:09.241 --> 1:06:11.129
<i>Hey, you guys deaf or what?
I said stop.</i>

1:06:11.257 --> 1:06:12.824
Okay, okay, we're stopped.

1:06:12.952 --> 1:06:16.314
We're gonna sit down
right here, okay?

1:06:16.442 --> 1:06:17.625
<i>Good.
Okay.</i>

1:06:17.752 --> 1:06:19.801
Oh, fuck!

1:06:19.929 --> 1:06:22.938
<i>Now, as much as
I'm enjoying watching you
scurry around like mice,</i>

1:06:23.065 --> 1:06:25.626
<i>I wonder if our listeners
aren't getting a little bored.</i>

1:06:25.753 --> 1:06:27.546
<i>So let's play a game.</i>

1:06:27.673 --> 1:06:29.914
<i>I've stopped the clock,
and I'm going to
give you the chance</i>

1:06:30.041 --> 1:06:32.378
<i>to win ten bonus minutes!</i>

1:06:32.507 --> 1:06:35.001
<i>All you have to do
is crack the code.</i>

1:06:35.896 --> 1:06:37.816
<i>What code?
Oh, it's simple.</i>

1:06:37.945 --> 1:06:39.194
<i>You have four people
on your team.</i>

1:06:39.322 --> 1:06:41.242
<i>Mary and Steven
are right here with me,</i>

1:06:41.370 --> 1:06:43.672
<i>even if they are a bit
"tied up" at the moment.</i>

1:06:43.801 --> 1:06:45.592
<i>And then there's Dylan and you.</i>

1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:47.098
<i>Four players, four chances.</i>

1:06:47.226 --> 1:06:48.985
<i>I'm going to give you
three numbers,</i>

1:06:49.114 --> 1:06:50.905
<i>and you have to find
the correct order.</i>

1:06:51.034 --> 1:06:53.209
<i>If you don't,
you lose ten minutes</i>

1:06:53.337 --> 1:06:55.386
<i>and one of you
will be disciplined.</i>

1:06:55.513 --> 1:06:57.370
Gary, I don't wanna play
this fucking game.

1:06:57.497 --> 1:06:59.385
<i>Shut your mouth and play!</i>

1:06:59.513 --> 1:07:01.784
Okay, okay, calm down.
Keep your shorts on.

1:07:01.912 --> 1:07:02.936
<i>Excellent!</i>

1:07:03.066 --> 1:07:04.250
<i>Let's start with Steven.</i>

1:07:04.377 --> 1:07:05.978
<i>Come on over
to the microphone, Steven.</i>

1:07:06.106 --> 1:07:10.170
These are the numbers:
One, two and three.

1:07:10.297 --> 1:07:11.833
What order do you want to try?

1:07:11.962 --> 1:07:14.586
<i>Don't come up!
He's crazy! It's a trap!</i>

1:07:14.713 --> 1:07:15.961
<i>It's a fuckin' trap!</i>

1:07:21.081 --> 1:07:23.225
<i>You guys aren't off
to a very good start.</i>

1:07:23.353 --> 1:07:25.689
<i>Fortunately Steven
won't be opening his mouth</i>

1:07:25.816 --> 1:07:27.385
<i>to talk any more shit.</i>

1:07:27.513 --> 1:07:31.481
It's time to move on
to the second member
of your team-- Mary.

1:07:31.609 --> 1:07:32.696
Come on down.

1:07:32.826 --> 1:07:34.616
<i>Remember,
we have three numbers:</i>

1:07:34.746 --> 1:07:36.858
<i>One, two and three.</i>

1:07:36.985 --> 1:07:39.384
<i>Well, Mary,
you'd better not screw this up.</i>

1:07:39.513 --> 1:07:42.360
<i>Steven has endangered the team
by acting like an asshole.</i>

1:07:42.489 --> 1:07:45.337
<i>So think hard now,
Mary, and...</i>

1:07:46.008 --> 1:07:47.513
<i>Three...</i>

1:07:47.641 --> 1:07:49.784
<i>two... one.</i>

1:07:53.912 --> 1:07:55.576
<i>No dice!</i>

1:07:55.705 --> 1:07:56.696
<i>But well played.</i>

1:07:56.826 --> 1:07:57.721
<i>Two more chances.</i>

1:07:57.849 --> 1:08:00.057
<i>Elvis, over to you.</i>

1:08:00.504 --> 1:08:01.913
Two, three, one.

1:08:07.800 --> 1:08:11.096
<i>Nope!
So, it's not two, three, one.
It's not three, two, one.</i>

1:08:11.225 --> 1:08:13.177
<i>Don't shit yourself, Dylan.</i>

1:08:13.305 --> 1:08:16.601
<i>Mathematically,
there are only four
possible combinations left.</i>

1:08:16.728 --> 1:08:18.458
<i>It's your turn.</i>

1:08:19.640 --> 1:08:22.233
<i>I'm not gonna tell you
what I've got planned
if you lose</i>

1:08:22.361 --> 1:08:24.376
<i>because I don't wanna put
too much pressure on you,</i>

1:08:24.504 --> 1:08:27.161
<i>but, uh, if you don't
crack that code,</i>

1:08:27.288 --> 1:08:29.175
<i>Mary might not thank you.</i>

1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:33.497
<i>Well?</i>

1:08:37.208 --> 1:08:38.361
One...

1:08:39.417 --> 1:08:40.889
three...

1:08:42.489 --> 1:08:43.961
two.

1:08:47.511 --> 1:08:50.969
<i>Bravo!
One, three, two is correct!</i>

1:08:51.097 --> 1:08:52.312
<i>You've won an extra...</i>

1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:54.104
<i>You can take your time
coming upstairs.</i>

1:08:54.231 --> 1:08:56.632
<i>I'll be waiting for you
to music.</i>

1:08:56.760 --> 1:08:59.640
<i>Maestro, take it away!</i>

1:09:01.657 --> 1:09:02.871
Wait, wait!

1:09:03.001 --> 1:09:05.048
There's no time.
We gotta go.

1:09:05.177 --> 1:09:06.041
I'm dead.

1:09:06.169 --> 1:09:07.671
If we reach the top
out of breath,

1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:08.921
we'll be good for nothing.

1:09:09.048 --> 1:09:10.712
Steven's right, it's a trap.

1:09:10.841 --> 1:09:14.040
Stairs, corridors--
Gary's got it all figured out.

1:09:14.169 --> 1:09:16.728
You're right, we'll be walking
right into the lion's den.

1:09:16.857 --> 1:09:18.681
From the start, he's wanted you
to go down to reception.

1:09:18.808 --> 1:09:20.505
He knew you'd stop
at the video room on the way

1:09:20.632 --> 1:09:22.360
and he knew he could take
your place at the microphone

1:09:22.488 --> 1:09:24.664
and still make you
come back up-- why?

1:09:24.793 --> 1:09:26.296
Why? 'Cause he's having fun.

1:09:26.424 --> 1:09:27.831
He wants me to suffer.

1:09:27.961 --> 1:09:30.041
Most lunatics don't see
their crazy plans through,

1:09:30.168 --> 1:09:33.752
but this guy,
we got ahold of a bona fide
psychopathic killer.

1:09:33.881 --> 1:09:36.536
I'm sorry I dragged you
into this, kid, really I am,

1:09:36.665 --> 1:09:38.359
but we gotta go,
there's nothing else for it.

1:09:38.489 --> 1:09:40.600
What's gonna happen up there?
I don't know.

1:09:40.728 --> 1:09:43.000
He'll be expecting us to come
through the stairway door,

1:09:43.127 --> 1:09:44.505
and then he'll probably...

1:09:45.014 --> 1:09:46.296
Fuck.

1:09:46.425 --> 1:09:47.928
We got to find a different way.

1:09:48.055 --> 1:09:49.592
Oh... Oh.

1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:50.968
Oh, come on!

1:10:08.919 --> 1:10:12.184
It's not there. We've
still got one floor to go.

1:10:12.312 --> 1:10:13.464
Yeah.

1:10:17.911 --> 1:10:19.575
Okay.

1:10:30.872 --> 1:10:32.440
Come on, kid.

1:11:14.294 --> 1:11:15.639
Okay.

1:11:18.776 --> 1:11:20.631
Oh, shit!

1:11:20.759 --> 1:11:24.567
Ah, the dulcet tones of opera
never did anybody any harm.

1:11:24.696 --> 1:11:27.096
Let's take a moment to catch up

1:11:27.223 --> 1:11:31.000
with our favorite idiot, Elvis.

1:11:31.127 --> 1:11:33.399
I don't see Olivia
or Adria anywhere,

1:11:33.527 --> 1:11:34.871
but he's got Mary tied up.

1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:38.872
Fuck. Okay.
Now he's probably
expecting us to...

1:11:42.872 --> 1:11:45.207
Oh, fuck!

1:11:47.255 --> 1:11:48.471
Fuck!

1:11:49.143 --> 1:11:50.904
This is my fault.

1:11:51.607 --> 1:11:53.367
I told him to come up here.

1:11:54.871 --> 1:11:57.495
He's expecting us
to come from the stairway.

1:11:57.623 --> 1:12:00.118
We'll run in this door,
get in behind him,

1:12:00.247 --> 1:12:01.816
we'll jump him, and then...

1:12:01.942 --> 1:12:04.855
What?
I don't think I can do this.

1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:08.727
Okay, okay. Listen.

1:12:08.855 --> 1:12:10.551
Look, you take this,
all right?

1:12:10.679 --> 1:12:13.014
You're gonna need it more.
Give me the box cutter.

1:12:13.143 --> 1:12:14.967
And then we'll both...

1:12:15.095 --> 1:12:17.303
Well, I'll go in,
I'll get control of him.

1:12:17.431 --> 1:12:20.023
You run around the back
to the other door

1:12:20.151 --> 1:12:22.263
and get the drop on him
that way, okay,

1:12:22.391 --> 1:12:24.311
and try and find
my family, all right?

1:12:24.439 --> 1:12:25.654
Okay.
Okay.

1:12:25.783 --> 1:12:27.383
You ready?
I'm depending on you.
Okay.

1:12:27.511 --> 1:12:29.303
One, two, three, go!

1:13:05.943 --> 1:13:08.023
Game's up, Gary. It's all over.

1:13:08.151 --> 1:13:11.863
I finally get to meet
the star in person.

1:13:13.047 --> 1:13:14.583
I swear, if you don't tell me
where they are,

1:13:14.710 --> 1:13:16.502
I'm gonna...
You're gonna what?

1:13:16.630 --> 1:13:18.262
Huh?
Slit my throat on the air?

1:13:18.390 --> 1:13:21.238
At least everybody
will see your true colors.

1:13:21.366 --> 1:13:26.358
Listen up, ladies and gentlemen,
Elvis is about to kill
somebody live on the air.

1:13:26.486 --> 1:13:27.575
Bad luck, it's me.

1:13:27.702 --> 1:13:29.495
This will be Elvis's
second murder.

1:13:29.622 --> 1:13:31.638
First he killed Lauren,
because yes,

1:13:31.767 --> 1:13:34.870
it is your fault
she committed suicide.

1:13:34.999 --> 1:13:37.430
Now he's after
the helpless boyfriend.

1:13:37.558 --> 1:13:41.623
The good news is,
something's finally happening
on this boring-ass show.

1:13:41.750 --> 1:13:42.710
Dylan.

1:13:42.838 --> 1:13:46.166
Cut Mary loose, and, Mary,
when he does that,

1:13:46.294 --> 1:13:47.382
get us off the air, okay?

1:13:47.510 --> 1:13:49.174
Oh, no, no, no,
that's a bad idea.

1:13:49.302 --> 1:13:51.382
You don't wanna do that.

1:13:52.054 --> 1:13:54.198
What's that?
You're gonna laugh.

1:13:55.222 --> 1:13:57.302
If you kill me,
I'll have to drop this,

1:13:57.431 --> 1:14:00.117
and if the button comes up,
bada boom!

1:14:00.950 --> 1:14:03.350
What kind of B-grade
movie bullshit is this?

1:14:03.478 --> 1:14:06.679
You didn't think I was
gonna let you come up here
and ruin the end of the show?

1:14:06.805 --> 1:14:08.887
I figured somebody
would catch me eventually.

1:14:09.013 --> 1:14:11.510
This is my
"get out of jail free" card.

1:14:19.542 --> 1:14:21.174
Ah, right on time.

1:14:22.742 --> 1:14:24.981
The game might
not be over just yet.

1:14:27.510 --> 1:14:29.781
I'd get that
if I were you, Elvis.

1:14:30.486 --> 1:14:32.694
Mary.

1:14:32.821 --> 1:14:34.741
Put it on speaker.

1:14:40.661 --> 1:14:41.717
<i>Hello?</i>

1:14:41.846 --> 1:14:44.471
Good day, sir.
Thank you for your call.

1:14:44.597 --> 1:14:45.653
How are you today?

1:14:45.782 --> 1:14:47.446
<i>Can you introduce yourself?</i>

1:14:47.573 --> 1:14:50.805
Politeness would dictate
that the caller should
introduce himself first,

1:14:50.934 --> 1:14:52.885
though I think I actually
know who you are.

1:14:53.015 --> 1:14:56.887
And thank you
because you've called
at a great time.

1:14:57.013 --> 1:14:59.509
<i>I'm Bruce, LAPD SWAT team.</i>

1:14:59.637 --> 1:15:01.877
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Bruce. My name is Gary--

1:15:02.006 --> 1:15:04.982
Shut the fuck up, Gary.
Bruce, this is Elvis.

1:15:05.110 --> 1:15:07.317
I got ahold of a guy
here in the studio

1:15:07.446 --> 1:15:10.805
who's already
killed or kidnapped
several people already.

1:15:10.934 --> 1:15:12.373
He stashed my wife
and daughter someplace.

1:15:12.501 --> 1:15:14.613
I don't know where
the fuck they are.

1:15:15.381 --> 1:15:16.917
And he's holding a device,

1:15:17.047 --> 1:15:19.765
says he's gonna blow
the entire building up.

1:15:21.109 --> 1:15:24.086
I don't know
if it's true or not.
I think it could be bullshit.

1:15:24.213 --> 1:15:26.006
<i>We're aware
of the situation. I'm sorry.</i>

1:15:26.134 --> 1:15:27.926
<i>We found your wife
and daughter on the terrace,</i>

1:15:28.054 --> 1:15:30.261
<i>and... and, uh...</i>

1:15:30.390 --> 1:15:32.022
What, what? What, what?

1:15:32.149 --> 1:15:34.709
Did you kill them?
Did you fucking kill them?

1:15:36.693 --> 1:15:37.814
<i>We have a problem.</i>

1:15:37.941 --> 1:15:39.702
That's for sure.

1:15:39.829 --> 1:15:42.389
What the hell is going on?
Are they dead?

1:15:42.517 --> 1:15:45.205
<i>No. No, they're alive.</i>

1:15:45.333 --> 1:15:46.614
I'm not a monster.

1:15:46.742 --> 1:15:49.558
You're projecting
your own personality onto me.

1:15:50.837 --> 1:15:52.631
Well, then
what's the problem?

1:15:52.757 --> 1:15:55.605
<i>They're tied up
with explosives
we can't identify.</i>

1:15:55.733 --> 1:15:57.525
<i>Bomb squad's on its way,</i>

1:15:57.653 --> 1:15:59.924
<i>and this phone number
was written on a piece
of paper taped to them,</i>

1:16:00.053 --> 1:16:00.949
<i>so I called it.</i>

1:16:01.077 --> 1:16:02.900
You sick motherfucker.

1:16:03.030 --> 1:16:05.172
And you're a smart guy
so I think you can guess
what'll happen

1:16:05.301 --> 1:16:06.582
if I lift my finger
off the detonator?

1:16:06.709 --> 1:16:09.397
We'll have fireworks
up on the terrace.

1:16:09.525 --> 1:16:15.253
So, please, be so kind
as to put down the knife
and go sit.

1:16:15.925 --> 1:16:18.165
It's you I've come for,
not them.

1:16:18.293 --> 1:16:19.317
So trust me.

1:16:19.446 --> 1:16:20.533
Trust you.

1:16:20.661 --> 1:16:22.421
Yeah, you could use
a little more trust.

1:16:22.549 --> 1:16:23.797
Okay, you have two options:

1:16:23.924 --> 1:16:25.973
either you kill me
and I blow up Adria and Olivia,

1:16:26.102 --> 1:16:29.877
or you can be reasonable
and go sit the fuck down.

1:16:32.693 --> 1:16:34.229
No.

1:16:34.357 --> 1:16:37.012
Bruce, these explosives.

1:16:37.141 --> 1:16:38.997
Can they be deactivated?

1:16:40.406 --> 1:16:42.037
<i>I don't know,
I'm telling you.</i>

1:16:42.165 --> 1:16:44.053
<i>Never seen anything
like it in my life.</i>

1:16:44.180 --> 1:16:46.133
<i>It's got a motion detector,
so if they move,</i>

1:16:46.262 --> 1:16:47.957
<i>I think it might
set off the bomb and...</i>

1:16:48.086 --> 1:16:49.940
<i>and there's a digital
keypad for a code.</i>

1:16:50.070 --> 1:16:53.397
<i>I'm assuming Gary
knows the code.</i>

1:16:54.548 --> 1:16:55.285
<i>Gary?</i>

1:16:55.412 --> 1:16:56.950
Yes, I can
give you that code.

1:16:57.077 --> 1:17:00.694
But first tell Elvis
to remove his fucking knife
from my throat.

1:17:00.820 --> 1:17:02.197
It's sharp.

1:17:03.861 --> 1:17:05.461
Oh, kid, it's no use.

1:17:05.590 --> 1:17:08.084
Can't you see
this has nothing
to do with you?

1:17:08.214 --> 1:17:09.429
Same as for the knife.

1:17:09.556 --> 1:17:12.468
You shoot me,
and the terrace goes boom.

1:17:15.444 --> 1:17:19.700
So does the parking lot,
the reception, everything.

1:17:19.830 --> 1:17:22.613
That's what I call
ending the show with a bang.

1:17:34.804 --> 1:17:36.500
No use, kid, drop it.

1:17:36.628 --> 1:17:38.804
That's right, Dylan.
Listen to Daddy.

1:17:38.934 --> 1:17:39.925
Drop the gun.

1:17:41.588 --> 1:17:43.541
Oh, okay,
you wanna be a hero?

1:17:44.308 --> 1:17:46.741
Okay, I've got an idea.

1:17:47.830 --> 1:17:51.092
Why don't we
remove the explosive vests
from Adria and Olivia

1:17:51.220 --> 1:17:52.788
and put them on you instead?

1:17:52.917 --> 1:17:54.325
You can save the widow
and the orphan.

1:17:54.453 --> 1:17:57.460
You'll go down
in the history books, man.

1:17:57.588 --> 1:17:59.797
Now, there's a slight chance
you'll get blown up
in the process,

1:17:59.923 --> 1:18:01.876
but, uh,
I think it's worth it,
don't you?

1:18:03.476 --> 1:18:05.076
Hey, put the vests on me.

1:18:05.204 --> 1:18:07.060
It's me you want.

1:18:07.187 --> 1:18:08.949
Let me wear all
your crappy explosives

1:18:09.076 --> 1:18:11.188
and let these others go,
they're innocent.

1:18:11.316 --> 1:18:14.163
But that's no fun, Elvis.

1:18:14.292 --> 1:18:16.660
No, the fun part
is making you choose:

1:18:16.787 --> 1:18:18.580
who would you rather
wear the vests,

1:18:18.707 --> 1:18:21.076
your wife and daughter
or the new kid?

1:18:22.516 --> 1:18:24.277
Oh, my God.
I've got another idea.

1:18:24.404 --> 1:18:25.556
Let's draw straws.

1:18:25.683 --> 1:18:30.260
Elvis, you get to choose
who wears the vests.

1:18:30.388 --> 1:18:34.292
I am gonna write down
the name of each person,

1:18:34.421 --> 1:18:36.051
uh, except my own, of course.

1:18:36.180 --> 1:18:38.004
I'm not that crazy.

1:18:43.189 --> 1:18:45.173
All right, Elvis,
you do the honors.

1:18:53.717 --> 1:18:54.804
It's me.

1:18:54.933 --> 1:18:57.140
Wow. That is classy.

1:18:57.268 --> 1:18:59.252
I'd applaud, but that
would blow everything up.

1:18:59.379 --> 1:19:00.947
Don't fuck with me, Elvis.

1:19:01.076 --> 1:19:03.060
Tell us the truth.
It's me.

1:19:03.669 --> 1:19:05.972
Now, how is that possible?

1:19:10.675 --> 1:19:12.213
Luck has spoken.

1:19:12.339 --> 1:19:16.116
Dylan, you are the winner
and tonight's superhero.

1:19:16.243 --> 1:19:18.483
Now, why don't you
hand over that gun?

1:19:21.140 --> 1:19:24.242
Officer Bruce, you still there?

1:19:24.371 --> 1:19:28.147
I'm gonna give you
the deactivation codes
for the two vests.

1:19:28.276 --> 1:19:30.867
Then you're gonna carry them
down to us very carefully,

1:19:30.996 --> 1:19:32.851
because they're fragile.

1:19:33.684 --> 1:19:35.348
Now, remember,
if I drop this detonator,

1:19:35.475 --> 1:19:37.940
all the other bombs
are going to blow up.

1:19:38.068 --> 1:19:40.052
<i>Okay, Gary,
I'm listening.</i>

1:19:40.179 --> 1:19:42.068
For Olivia,

1:19:42.195 --> 1:19:47.251
060877 and the star key.

1:19:47.379 --> 1:19:48.660
For Adria,

1:19:48.789 --> 1:19:53.268
040478.

1:19:54.324 --> 1:19:56.691
<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

1:19:59.988 --> 1:20:02.323
No, hold on, shit.
It's the other way around.

1:20:02.451 --> 1:20:07.028
Um, 040478 is Olivia,
060877 is Adria.

1:20:07.155 --> 1:20:08.884
<i>Are you sure?</i>

1:20:09.010 --> 1:20:10.227
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

1:20:10.355 --> 1:20:12.242
I guess
we're about to find out.

1:20:21.683 --> 1:20:23.635
Beep... beep-beep-beep.

1:20:23.762 --> 1:20:25.715
<i>It's okay.</i>

1:20:25.843 --> 1:20:27.634
<i>It looks like the vests
have been deactivated.</i>

1:20:27.763 --> 1:20:31.411
What a relief.
To be honest, I wasn't
100% sure about those codes.

1:20:31.541 --> 1:20:33.043
I'm glad this worked out.

1:20:33.171 --> 1:20:35.155
<i>Everything's fine.
Olivia and Adria are safe.</i>

1:20:35.283 --> 1:20:36.659
<i>We're evacuating them now.</i>

1:20:36.788 --> 1:20:39.923
Okay, Bruce, but hurry up.
My hand's starting to cramp.

1:20:40.051 --> 1:20:42.643
I don't know how much longer
I can hold onto this thing.

1:20:44.116 --> 1:20:45.139
Thanks.

1:20:45.268 --> 1:20:48.371
For what? You know
I'm gonna kill you, right?

1:20:50.068 --> 1:20:51.796
For letting my family go.

1:20:57.683 --> 1:21:01.363
Gary, we all understand
your misfortune.

1:21:01.491 --> 1:21:03.539
But you don't
have to kill anybody.

1:21:03.668 --> 1:21:07.411
Tonight, all our listeners heard
what he did to Lauren.

1:21:07.538 --> 1:21:09.650
Everyone understands
how you feel.

1:21:10.578 --> 1:21:12.275
If you keep Elvis alive,

1:21:12.402 --> 1:21:14.322
he'll have to live with himself.

1:21:15.250 --> 1:21:18.739
After all, he's to blame
for everyone who died tonight.

1:21:20.019 --> 1:21:21.460
- We can agree on that.
- Exactly.

1:21:21.587 --> 1:21:23.379
This is all his fault.
He's the one to blame.

1:21:23.507 --> 1:21:28.403
If you let us all go,
we'll remember
only your pain and mercy.

1:21:28.532 --> 1:21:30.739
Everyone will understand
what you went through
in the army.

1:21:30.866 --> 1:21:33.907
The public
will be on your side.

1:21:34.546 --> 1:21:35.923
But if you kill him,

1:21:36.052 --> 1:21:37.362
that'll end it all.

1:21:37.490 --> 1:21:40.434
If Lauren were here,
right at this moment,

1:21:40.563 --> 1:21:43.603
she'd tell you
that you did well.

1:21:47.186 --> 1:21:49.299
Elvis has played
some nasty tricks on me too.

1:21:49.427 --> 1:21:52.819
The worst jokes since I
started working here.

1:21:53.492 --> 1:21:55.251
I can imagine
what Lauren felt.

1:21:55.379 --> 1:21:57.171
Really. Thank you.

1:21:57.299 --> 1:21:59.091
You've got the message out.

1:21:59.987 --> 1:22:02.803
Tomorrow Elvis won't
have a show anymore.

1:22:03.635 --> 1:22:05.874
But that's it.
That's enough.

1:22:06.003 --> 1:22:08.338
It's time to stop, okay?

1:22:16.978 --> 1:22:18.738
That's good, Gary.

1:22:18.865 --> 1:22:20.626
I'm upstairs at the door.

1:22:20.753 --> 1:22:22.546
I'm alone.

1:22:22.673 --> 1:22:24.722
All right, come on in, Bruce,
and no funny business

1:22:24.851 --> 1:22:27.154
or I'm gonna shoot Elvis
and I'll blow it all to hell.

1:22:27.282 --> 1:22:28.466
Calm down, Gary. Remember--

1:22:28.595 --> 1:22:30.675
Shut the fuck up!
That was all empty talk.

1:22:30.802 --> 1:22:32.371
You were leading me on,
weren't you?

1:22:32.500 --> 1:22:33.586
No.
Shh!

1:22:38.195 --> 1:22:39.283
Gary.

1:22:40.562 --> 1:22:42.002
See?

1:22:42.131 --> 1:22:43.569
I'm here.

1:22:43.697 --> 1:22:47.473
I'm not armed.
Everything's fine.

1:22:47.602 --> 1:22:51.473
Why don't you help Dylan
get dressed? I think
he's a little bit cold.

1:22:51.602 --> 1:22:52.818
Good.

1:22:54.771 --> 1:22:57.394
I'm sorry, kid.
It's gonna be all right.

1:22:58.610 --> 1:23:00.370
Hurry it up, Bruce.

1:23:01.074 --> 1:23:03.187
Now, on vest number one,

1:23:03.315 --> 1:23:06.227
enter 040478.

1:23:21.843 --> 1:23:23.506
Vest number two.

1:23:23.634 --> 1:23:28.657
060877.

1:23:35.122 --> 1:23:38.417
Okay, Gary.
This whole place
is surrounded.

1:23:38.546 --> 1:23:40.659
We all want this
to end well.

1:23:43.442 --> 1:23:45.008
We'd like
to offer you a deal.

1:23:47.506 --> 1:23:49.394
Boring!

1:23:49.522 --> 1:23:50.865
God! Oh!

1:23:50.994 --> 1:23:54.034
I just... I just don't know
how this can end, guys.

1:23:54.738 --> 1:23:56.402
It's not looking good, though,
is it?

1:23:56.529 --> 1:23:58.226
Not looking good at all.

1:23:58.802 --> 1:24:00.977
You know what? Fuck it.

1:24:01.106 --> 1:24:03.953
Let's free our listeners
from this never-ending show.

1:24:05.297 --> 1:24:09.266
Elvis, let me just say
you are the world's
worst fucking radio host.

1:24:10.674 --> 1:24:12.530
Now let's end this
with fireworks.

1:24:19.378 --> 1:24:22.034
No!

1:24:44.146 --> 1:24:45.778
That was a riot!

1:24:48.754 --> 1:24:50.289
That was amazing.

1:24:52.304 --> 1:24:54.609
How the hell
did we pull that off?

1:24:54.737 --> 1:24:55.761
Whoo!

1:24:55.890 --> 1:24:58.385
- I think we just...
- Insane. Insane.

1:24:58.513 --> 1:25:02.610
...performed the greatest prank
in the history of this show!

1:25:04.688 --> 1:25:05.809
My dear listeners.

1:25:05.938 --> 1:25:08.369
I'm sorry if we gave you
a huge scare.

1:25:08.496 --> 1:25:12.562
But this whole thing,
this entire thing
was just one big hoax.

1:25:12.689 --> 1:25:15.026
Yes, that's right.

1:25:15.153 --> 1:25:16.303
Yes!

1:25:16.433 --> 1:25:18.002
We were screwing with you,
that's right.

1:25:18.128 --> 1:25:19.953
We're a bunch
of dirty deceivers.

1:25:20.081 --> 1:25:25.361
And I'm sure his fans
recognized him
from the very start.

1:25:25.489 --> 1:25:28.656
Gary was played by none other
than James Steel,

1:25:28.784 --> 1:25:30.066
the king of the Internet!

1:25:30.193 --> 1:25:32.560
I think he slept with Bezos
to get the title.

1:25:32.689 --> 1:25:34.353
Yeah! What an actor.

1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:35.986
What a performance.
That was really amazing.

1:25:36.112 --> 1:25:38.961
In fact, it was so good,
I was in on it,

1:25:39.089 --> 1:25:40.145
I thought you'd snapped.

1:25:40.272 --> 1:25:42.353
Hey, what's up, everybody?

1:25:42.481 --> 1:25:43.793
That was one crazy trip,

1:25:43.922 --> 1:25:46.032
and you know you'll be
finding all the videos

1:25:46.161 --> 1:25:47.793
posted to my social media
tomorrow.

1:25:47.921 --> 1:25:49.808
Yes, that's right,
we filmed it all!

1:25:51.281 --> 1:25:53.009
I just wanna give
another shout out to my man,

1:25:53.137 --> 1:25:56.433
who we devised this prank for
over the past several weeks.

1:25:56.560 --> 1:25:58.801
The one and only Dylan!

1:26:03.121 --> 1:26:05.681
Yeah!

1:26:05.809 --> 1:26:08.433
And, Olivia, get your
talented ass over here.

1:26:08.561 --> 1:26:12.048
All right,
that was incredible!
Oh, my God.

1:26:12.177 --> 1:26:14.257
This is a very gifted actress
called Carole Weyers.

1:26:14.385 --> 1:26:18.161
And she not only did Olivia
but the voice of Adria.

1:26:18.289 --> 1:26:22.033
"Daddy, please save me!"

1:26:24.625 --> 1:26:26.704
And a big bravo
to Richard Anderson,

1:26:26.833 --> 1:26:29.553
who played
our very credible SWAT guy.

1:26:29.680 --> 1:26:32.047
You really were
pretty scared, man.

1:26:32.177 --> 1:26:33.616
Yeah.

1:26:33.745 --> 1:26:37.169
And, of course, we warned LA
and Pasadena's PD in advance.

1:26:37.297 --> 1:26:39.792
We gotta keep our cops
kosher, right?

1:26:39.921 --> 1:26:42.321
So, let me clarify
that no police were involved,

1:26:42.449 --> 1:26:45.361
hurt or made to look worse
than they actually are.

1:26:45.487 --> 1:26:47.056
So...

1:26:47.185 --> 1:26:48.880
By the way, Mary and I...

1:26:49.009 --> 1:26:51.697
we're actually
not sleeping together.

1:26:51.824 --> 1:26:53.297
Oh!
Yet.

1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:56.369
I have a rule:
no men over 80 years old.

1:26:56.497 --> 1:26:59.217
Oh, yeah, you don't want old age
creeping up on you.

1:26:59.345 --> 1:27:01.297
And Justin back from the dead!

1:27:01.424 --> 1:27:03.185
Whoo!
Whoo!

1:27:03.313 --> 1:27:04.336
Must eat your brain!

1:27:04.464 --> 1:27:06.161
My brains, aw,
it's a very small thing.

1:27:06.289 --> 1:27:08.209
You know you got off
on watching me dead.

1:27:08.336 --> 1:27:09.808
Oh, yeah, I want
your fuckin' slot, man,

1:27:09.937 --> 1:27:11.793
but you know I love you,
buddy, I love you.

1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:13.201
But you did say,
"Go fuck yourself."

1:27:13.327 --> 1:27:14.480
You didn't mean that,
did you?

1:27:14.608 --> 1:27:15.824
Oh, I meant it.
I was kind of hurt by that.

1:27:15.952 --> 1:27:17.680
I'm a big fan of yours,
you know that.

1:27:17.809 --> 1:27:20.689
I was really proud
to be a part of this.
Thanks. What a suck-up.

1:27:20.816 --> 1:27:22.161
I'd like to say something.

1:27:22.288 --> 1:27:24.208
I'd like to say something
if I may.

1:27:24.336 --> 1:27:26.033
You know,
I really want to apologize

1:27:26.159 --> 1:27:27.504
for having attacked
poor Dylan.

1:27:27.632 --> 1:27:28.913
Yeah, dude,
what were you thinking?

1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:30.928
You freaked me out.
You were supposed to attack me.

1:27:31.057 --> 1:27:33.616
I don't know. Listen,
I just got carried away.

1:27:33.744 --> 1:27:35.793
I mean,
I was so excited. Sorry.

1:27:35.920 --> 1:27:38.512
This is Tony,
played by Tony.

1:27:41.296 --> 1:27:42.961
A very highly strung
performance there.

1:27:43.087 --> 1:27:44.304
Tony's one
of the crazy actors

1:27:44.432 --> 1:27:45.809
who's been working
with me for years.

1:27:45.936 --> 1:27:48.208
Elvis, this is one of the best
shows of my life, thank you.

1:27:48.336 --> 1:27:51.344
Dylan, we promised
to make you feel welcome,

1:27:51.472 --> 1:27:54.352
and I think, I think we've done
just that, yeah, don't you?

1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:58.959
But the real question is,
after all of this...

1:27:59.088 --> 1:28:01.168
will we see you back
in the studio tomorrow

1:28:01.295 --> 1:28:04.657
or are you gonna
just go away and hate us
for the rest of your life?

1:28:20.464 --> 1:28:22.352
- Awww!
- Aw, come on!

1:28:22.480 --> 1:28:23.408
Dylan!

1:28:23.536 --> 1:28:25.392
Maybe we went too far.

1:28:26.128 --> 1:28:27.184
Dylan.
Dylan.

1:28:27.312 --> 1:28:29.456
Dylan, come on, bro.
Come on.

1:28:31.152 --> 1:28:33.264
Dylan. Don't be that guy.

1:28:33.392 --> 1:28:35.312
Hey, buddy!

1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:36.847
Buddy!

1:28:36.976 --> 1:28:38.480
You're better than that.

1:28:38.608 --> 1:28:40.720
Dylan, come on, dude.

1:28:41.328 --> 1:28:43.119
Dylan? Dylan?

1:28:43.248 --> 1:28:45.425
Come on back.
Let's be live, baby.

1:28:45.551 --> 1:28:46.959
Tell us what you thought
of all this.

1:28:47.088 --> 1:28:49.935
I mean, we really worked
our asses off for you, kid.

1:28:50.064 --> 1:28:51.024
Oh, come on!

1:28:51.151 --> 1:28:53.136
- Oh, come on.
- Yes!

1:28:53.263 --> 1:28:55.599
Probably
crossed the line there.

1:28:57.679 --> 1:28:58.575
Hey.

1:28:58.703 --> 1:29:00.272
Hey, Carole, the mic.

1:29:00.399 --> 1:29:02.511
Come on, Dylan.
Don't get mad, get even.

1:29:02.639 --> 1:29:04.016
All right?

1:29:05.008 --> 1:29:07.215
Hey, say a few words
to the listeners.

1:29:07.919 --> 1:29:09.231
Come on, kid, speak up.

1:29:09.359 --> 1:29:11.727
Come on, kid, it's your moment.
Let's go.

1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:15.919
Come on, dude.
Hey, Dylan, man up, come on.

1:29:16.048 --> 1:29:18.768
We've all
had to change our shorts
more than once this year.

1:29:18.895 --> 1:29:19.888
Hey, what...?

1:29:20.016 --> 1:29:21.519
Whoa!
Holy shit!

1:29:21.648 --> 1:29:23.278
Oh, my God!
Dylan!

1:29:26.705 --> 1:29:27.665
Call 911!

1:29:27.791 --> 1:29:29.263
Oh, my God.

1:29:29.391 --> 1:29:31.118
Oh, my God.
Shit.

1:29:44.623 --> 1:29:46.191
He's dead.

1:29:48.271 --> 1:29:49.327
What?

1:30:40.047 --> 1:30:41.455
We're taking away the body.

1:30:41.583 --> 1:30:43.726
We will need you
for the deposition.

1:30:43.855 --> 1:30:46.831
Please go home
so we can find you.

1:30:51.950 --> 1:30:55.024
There are dozens
of journalists and press
out the front.

1:30:55.151 --> 1:30:56.880
You should
go through the back.

1:30:57.006 --> 1:30:59.022
Go home
to Olivia and Adria.

1:31:25.102 --> 1:31:27.694
How many times did I warn you?

1:31:28.750 --> 1:31:30.638
I told you it was too much.

1:31:32.846 --> 1:31:34.831
You killed him, Elvis.

1:31:35.662 --> 1:31:38.318
It's your fault.
You did this.

1:31:40.718 --> 1:31:42.414
He was just a kid.

1:31:44.975 --> 1:31:48.942
For years I've been
telling you to put some limits
on your practical jokes,

1:31:49.070 --> 1:31:51.855
but no, it was never
enough for you.

1:31:54.350 --> 1:31:57.997
I knew it. I fucking knew
it would end badly.

1:32:00.751 --> 1:32:04.718
I don't even have to fire you
because your career is over now.

1:32:09.807 --> 1:32:11.310
I'm done.

1:32:13.518 --> 1:32:15.950
I won't ever go
on the mic again.

1:32:17.487 --> 1:32:19.182
Where are you going now?

1:32:21.295 --> 1:32:22.351
Home.

1:32:22.478 --> 1:32:23.661
No, no, no, no.
Come here. Come here.

1:32:23.790 --> 1:32:25.519
Reporters are crawling
everywhere.

1:32:25.645 --> 1:32:27.278
The bloodsuckers
are waiting by your car.

1:32:27.406 --> 1:32:29.518
Come on, get in.
I'll take you home. Get in.

1:32:35.662 --> 1:32:37.326
Fuck, Elvis!

1:32:38.990 --> 1:32:40.495
The media will get you.

1:32:40.623 --> 1:32:41.997
And your family too.

1:32:43.021 --> 1:32:45.006
I won't be surprised
if they leave you.

1:32:45.133 --> 1:32:46.894
You'll probably
be serving time.

1:32:47.022 --> 1:32:49.006
You're gonna need
a fucking good lawyer,
that's for sure.

1:32:49.135 --> 1:32:51.406
Okay, I need to calm down now.

1:32:51.533 --> 1:32:53.517
Max, please, turn on the radio.

1:32:53.645 --> 1:32:55.983
<i>As we said earlier,
breaking news.</i>

1:32:56.110 --> 1:32:59.181
<i>From what we know,
something happened
during the night</i>

1:32:59.310 --> 1:33:02.733
<i>at the KLAT-FM radio station.
Stay here.</i>

1:33:02.861 --> 1:33:04.333
<i>We'll explain it
in details later,</i>

1:33:04.462 --> 1:33:06.990
<i>but I was told that
radio star Elvis Cooney</i>

1:33:07.117 --> 1:33:08.653
<i>is apparently listening
to the radio...</i>

1:33:08.781 --> 1:33:09.966
<i>Face it.
...right now.</i>

1:33:10.093 --> 1:33:13.549
<i>And we have a very important
message for him.</i>

1:33:14.159 --> 1:33:16.429
<i>Elvis, happy birthday.</i>

1:33:16.557 --> 1:33:20.269
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1:33:21.134 --> 1:33:22.413
Surprise.

1:33:22.541 --> 1:33:23.630
Happy birthday!

1:33:25.869 --> 1:33:28.141
Happy birthday, honey.

1:33:29.102 --> 1:33:29.997
Dylan!

1:33:31.597 --> 1:33:34.734
What the...?
You motherfuckers.

1:33:34.861 --> 1:33:36.365
You motherfuckers!
We got ya!

1:33:36.493 --> 1:33:38.158
Oh, Jesus!

1:33:44.237 --> 1:33:45.903
You! Come here.

1:33:46.060 --> 1:33:48.718
I'm glad you're still alive.
I really am, I'm glad, kid.

1:33:48.845 --> 1:33:50.156
Actually, it's Max.

1:33:50.285 --> 1:33:53.582
Horse falls, car stunts,
and, uh... staircases.

1:33:55.374 --> 1:33:56.557
Kind of a Stuntman 101.

1:33:56.685 --> 1:33:58.541
And we threw in
a few little extras.

1:33:58.669 --> 1:34:01.198
- Like that fight with Tony.
- Oh.

1:34:01.325 --> 1:34:03.022
Ah, you!

1:34:03.149 --> 1:34:06.124
When Mary told us she wanted
to trap the next newbie,

1:34:06.253 --> 1:34:09.806
I called James
and we came up with
this beautiful happy ending.

1:34:09.933 --> 1:34:12.365
- Happy birthday!
- Mary!

1:34:15.438 --> 1:34:17.900
Happy birthday, you prick!

1:34:18.542 --> 1:34:20.173
You should have seen
your face!

1:34:20.302 --> 1:34:21.422
Oh, you were fucked up.

1:34:21.549 --> 1:34:22.700
Say "cheese," Elvis.

1:34:22.829 --> 1:34:24.461
You know this reaction shot
is going viral.

1:34:24.589 --> 1:34:26.861
<i>Yay! Yes, yes!</i>

1:34:26.989 --> 1:34:28.397
You fuckin' got me!

1:34:28.525 --> 1:34:30.958
You're all a bunch
of complicit assholes, okay?

1:34:31.084 --> 1:34:34.924
Sleep with one eye open
because my revenge
will be ruthless.

1:34:35.053 --> 1:34:36.301
Ohh!

1:34:36.430 --> 1:34:38.669
Now, it is time for bed, yeah?
Yes.

1:34:38.797 --> 1:34:40.334
So we'll leave you
with the final word.

1:34:40.462 --> 1:34:41.837
What do you wanna say?

1:34:41.965 --> 1:34:44.110
I'll have the final word,
all right. Um...

1:34:45.102 --> 1:34:47.342
I'll see you all tomorrow.

1:34:47.468 --> 1:34:49.102
