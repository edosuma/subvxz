WEBVTT

00:03.450 --> 00:05.618
- You ready to go?
- Let me just finish this.

00:05.785 --> 00:09.038
Hey, Ross. Check this out.

00:13.751 --> 00:15.503
Yeah, I can't do that. Heh.

00:16.921 --> 00:18.882
- What are you doing?
- Have you seen this?

00:19.048 --> 00:21.468
It's our new alumni website for college.

00:21.676 --> 00:25.388
You can post messages for people,
let everyone know what you're up to.

00:25.597 --> 00:29.976
Oh, great. A faster way to tell people
that I'm unemployed and childless.

00:30.185 --> 00:33.146
It's actually interesting to find
out what people are doing.

00:33.313 --> 00:34.772
Remember Andrea Rich?

00:34.981 --> 00:37.108
- Tall girl, wouldn't sleep with you?
- Uh-huh.

00:37.317 --> 00:42.071
Well, her Internet company went under,
and she lost an ear in a boating accident.

00:43.406 --> 00:45.909
Bet she'd sleep with you now.

00:47.327 --> 00:49.662
No, I already e-mailed her.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.832
Let me see what you wrote
about yourself.

00:52.999 --> 00:57.086
- Oh.
- "Doctor of paleontology, two kids."

00:57.295 --> 01:00.882
Wait a second. You split with Carol
because you had different interests?

01:01.049 --> 01:05.303
I think you split with Carol because
you had one very similar interest.

01:06.429 --> 01:09.516
You know what? I'm gonna finish this later,
okay? Let me just grab my coat.

01:09.682 --> 01:11.351
Okay.

01:14.270 --> 01:17.398
What, did you think you learned how
to do it in the last two minutes?

01:21.694 --> 01:24.364
Maybe we finish this for him.

01:29.118 --> 01:32.914
Also, I cloned a dinosaur in my lab.

01:33.623 --> 01:36.292
She is now my girlfriend.

01:37.544 --> 01:41.881
I don't care what society says,
it's the best sex I've ever had.

01:43.383 --> 01:47.679
- And send.
- No, no... You can't do that to him.

01:47.845 --> 01:49.847
- All right, let's go.
- Dude!

01:50.014 --> 01:54.519
Uh, I think you made it clear you can't be
trusted with the ball inside the house.

02:01.150 --> 02:03.069
And send.

02:44.319 --> 02:46.571
Hey. How was basketball?

02:46.779 --> 02:49.657
It was fun. Right up until Chandler
got a finger in the eye.

02:49.824 --> 02:51.743
Oh, no. Who did that?

02:51.909 --> 02:54.245
Chandler. Yeah.

02:54.746 --> 02:56.539
H93'-

02:57.457 --> 02:58.666
- Rash?
- Yeah?

02:58.875 --> 03:01.836
What's Huggsy doing
in the crib with Emma?

03:02.503 --> 03:04.631
She was just crawling around
and she found him...

03:04.797 --> 03:07.175
...so I just let her sleep with him.

03:07.342 --> 03:11.054
- That's all right, isn't it?
- Of course. Yeah.

03:11.220 --> 03:16.476
It's a stuffed animal, you know?
It's for kids. Not for adults.

03:16.643 --> 03:18.353
I know that.

03:18.561 --> 03:21.439
Joey, you're sure? I mean,
I know how much you love him.

03:21.606 --> 03:26.819
Rachel, let's be clear on this, okay?
I do not love Huggsy.

03:27.070 --> 03:29.822
I like him a normal amount.

03:31.115 --> 03:33.576
All right. Well, Emma loves him.

03:33.785 --> 03:37.205
Yeah. Well, why wouldn't she?
He's a wonderful person.

03:41.918 --> 03:44.962
- Hi.
- Hey, Phoebe. How you doing?

03:45.129 --> 03:48.424
- You feeling better?
- Breaking up sucks.

03:48.591 --> 03:52.428
- Oh, I really miss Mike.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:52.637 --> 03:56.432
I've tried everything to feel better.
I even tried writing a song about it...

03:56.599 --> 03:58.851
...but I can't think of anything
that rhymes with:

04:02.772 --> 04:05.692
Hey, Monica, I'm gonna need
your help getting through this.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.069
You're saying you're
not gonna need my help?

04:08.277 --> 04:10.488
No. When I get to the point
where I'm ready...

04:10.655 --> 04:14.033
...to hear cruel, mocking jokes
about Mike, I'm gonna come to you.

04:14.200 --> 04:18.161
Oh, good, because I've already thought
of three. Four! I just thought of a fourth.

04:19.204 --> 04:21.708
Okay. I mean,
I know I did the right thing.

04:21.916 --> 04:23.418
Mike never wants to get married...

04:23.584 --> 04:26.629
...and I shouldn't be in a relationship
that has no future.

04:26.796 --> 04:29.132
But pretty soon,
I'm gonna miss him so much...

04:29.298 --> 04:32.260
...I'm gonna want to see him again,
and you have to stop me.

04:32.468 --> 04:34.721
Okay, you got it.

04:36.723 --> 04:40.143
Unless...
Am I being too crazy about this?

04:40.309 --> 04:42.103
All right, so, you know,
there's no future.

04:42.270 --> 04:45.148
But that doesn't mean
we still can't have fun.

04:45.523 --> 04:49.068
- You know what? Forget what I said.
- Really?

04:49.235 --> 04:52.947
- All right, if that's what you want.
- That was a test, and you just failed.

04:53.990 --> 04:56.993
Damn it! Rookie mistake.

05:01.122 --> 05:03.624
I have sex with dinosaurs?

05:06.252 --> 05:08.921
I believe I read that somewhere.

05:09.672 --> 05:12.508
Not only is it not funny,
it's physically impossible. Okay?

05:12.675 --> 05:17.847
Depending on the species, I'd have
to have a 6-foot-long... It's not funny!

05:19.140 --> 05:21.642
I respectfully disagree.

05:21.851 --> 05:24.187
I can't believe you put that
on my alumni page.

05:24.395 --> 05:27.023
- Who cares? Nobody reads those.
- You better hope not...

05:27.231 --> 05:29.484
...because I just read what
you put on your page.

05:29.692 --> 05:33.029
- I don't have a page.
- Oh, I respectfully disagree!

05:51.214 --> 05:55.218
Look at you. All sweet
and innocent, sleeping like an angel.

05:55.802 --> 05:59.263
With Emma's chubby little hands
wrapped around you.

06:01.307 --> 06:04.769
It's okay, Emma. You stay asleep.

06:06.437 --> 06:09.315
Step away from the crib!
I have a weapon!

06:09.482 --> 06:13.236
It's okay! It's okay, Rach!
It's me! Put down the scrunchie.

06:14.028 --> 06:16.864
- What are you doing?
- Well, I heard Emma stirring...

06:17.031 --> 06:20.076
...so I came in to make sure
she could reach Huggsy.

06:20.243 --> 06:25.289
Oh. Oh, thanks. All right, well, now that
I'm up, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

06:25.456 --> 06:29.043
Okay, there you go, sweetie.

06:29.377 --> 06:31.504
This isn't over.

06:35.967 --> 06:39.053
Wait a second. Why would
Ross tell everyone in your class...

06:39.262 --> 06:43.099
...that you are
"as gay as the day is long"?

06:44.058 --> 06:47.228
Because I told everyone
he slept with dinosaurs.

06:47.854 --> 06:52.692
Well, that's clearly a joke.
This could easily be true.

06:54.151 --> 06:58.447
Would you get that, please? People have
been calling to congratulate me all day.

07:01.868 --> 07:03.035
Hello?

07:03.202 --> 07:07.039
No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife.

07:07.540 --> 07:10.293
Yeah. Well, it came
as quite a shock to me too.

07:12.587 --> 07:14.171
Well, I guess I should've known. Yeah.

07:14.338 --> 07:17.258
He just kept making me watch
Moulin Rouge.

07:17.425 --> 07:19.051
Hang up-Hang UP-

07:19.218 --> 07:21.178
And that was a great movie.

07:23.139 --> 07:25.933
I'm so gonna get back at Ross.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.477
Oh, yeah, this'll show him. Here we go.

07:28.686 --> 07:32.023
- What are you doing?
- Oh, you'll see, my friend!

07:36.527 --> 07:39.071
I'm dead?

07:40.907 --> 07:43.117
And so young.

07:43.784 --> 07:47.580
Posting that I died?
That really isn't funny.

07:48.247 --> 07:49.749
Well, how you died was funny.

07:49.957 --> 07:52.627
Oh, please. Hit by a blimp?

07:53.419 --> 07:57.548
It kills over one Americans every year.

07:58.299 --> 08:01.594
Unbelievable. My classmates
are gonna think I'm dead.

08:01.761 --> 08:04.847
My professors. My parents
are gonna get phone calls.

08:05.014 --> 08:07.016
You're messing
with people's feelings here.

08:07.224 --> 08:08.768
You wanna talk about people's feelings?

08:08.935 --> 08:11.062
You should have heard how hurt
Professor Stern was...

08:11.228 --> 08:14.231
...when I told him I wouldn't be able
to go with him to Key West!

08:15.900 --> 08:18.778
You've really crossed a line here.
But that's okay.

08:18.945 --> 08:21.739
Because I'm on my way
to buy some Photoshop software...

08:21.906 --> 08:23.491
...and a stack of gay porn.

08:23.658 --> 08:26.869
That's right. Your coming-out
is about to get real graphic!

08:32.625 --> 08:35.169
God, I wish Mike were here.

08:35.794 --> 08:38.965
Okay, if Mike were here,
what would the two of you be doing?

08:40.256 --> 08:43.177
What are you, animals?
It's 4:00 in the afternoon.

08:44.470 --> 08:47.974
I gotta call him. Just to talk to him.
There's no harm in that.

08:48.140 --> 08:49.850
Phoebe, that's how it starts.

08:50.017 --> 08:53.521
"I don't need to eat the cake,
I'll just smell the icing.

08:53.688 --> 08:57.900
Why not just a little sliver?"
Or, "Okay, just a slice or two."

08:58.067 --> 09:00.236
You know, the next thing you know,
you're 210 pounds...

09:00.403 --> 09:03.155
...and you get wedged in going
down the tunnel slide.

09:05.241 --> 09:06.993
Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard.

09:07.159 --> 09:10.413
But look, if you talk to him,
then you're gonna want to see him.

09:10.579 --> 09:13.332
And if you see him, you're gonna
wanna get back together.

09:13.499 --> 09:16.252
And I know that's not what you want.

09:17.670 --> 09:20.256
All right, so give me your phone.

09:20.548 --> 09:22.550
- Here.
- Thank you.

09:22.717 --> 09:26.595
- And now your cell.
- Okay.

09:30.808 --> 09:32.601
There you go.

09:39.483 --> 09:43.237
- This is your cell phone?
- Yes.

09:43.446 --> 09:45.948
This is your current cell phone?

09:47.366 --> 09:50.661
Yes.
It reminds me of a simpler time.

09:52.246 --> 09:54.623
Phoebe? Where's your purse?

09:57.209 --> 09:58.836
â€œHey! No!
- No!

09:59.003 --> 10:00.796
- Give it to me!
- You can't have it.

10:00.963 --> 10:03.049
- Give it to me!
- No.

10:05.176 --> 10:07.136
- I'll go in there.
- Oh, yeah.

10:07.303 --> 10:08.512
- Come here!
- No!

10:08.679 --> 10:12.641
- Give it to me!
- You're crazy! God.

10:13.309 --> 10:14.977
Aha!

10:15.144 --> 10:17.480
Damn you, Monica Geller hyphen Bing!

10:20.900 --> 10:26.113
Hey, look who's here. It's Joey.
And he brought home a friend.

10:26.322 --> 10:27.364
Joey, Emma's right here.

10:27.531 --> 10:30.451
You promised not to bring girls home
in the middle of the day anymore.

10:30.659 --> 10:33.537
No, no, no, it's not a girl. It's...

10:33.704 --> 10:35.998
- ...a brand-new Huggsy!
- Oh.

10:36.582 --> 10:39.877
Oh, that's so great.
Now Emma has two Huggsies.

10:40.044 --> 10:44.173
No, no. Oh, no.
No, Emma has one Huggsy.

10:44.340 --> 10:46.050
The new Huggsy. Huh?

10:46.217 --> 10:49.804
The other Huggsy, I don't know,
I guess I'll just take him back.

10:49.970 --> 10:54.850
You know what? When I was a little girl,
I had a little pink pony named Cotton.

10:55.017 --> 10:59.522
Oh, I loved her so much. I took her
everywhere. I would braid her tail...

10:59.688 --> 11:01.649
Make the transfer!

11:05.736 --> 11:09.740
Should I be concerned that a button fell
off the old Huggsy and I can't find it?

11:09.949 --> 11:13.285
Don't worry about it.
I swallowed that years ago. Hey.

11:15.162 --> 11:18.707
Oh, what? I don't think
she likes the new Huggsy.

11:18.958 --> 11:21.752
- But he's the same.
- I think she wants the old one back.

11:21.961 --> 11:24.964
- Yeah, but he's the same.
- Joey, come on.

11:25.172 --> 11:27.800
But he's the same.

11:30.302 --> 11:32.888
You're not the same.

11:35.015 --> 11:36.308
Aha!

11:36.684 --> 11:39.186
You know, it's a lot
less surprising to do that...

11:39.353 --> 11:41.647
...after I've buzzed you into the building.

11:42.940 --> 11:46.277
So, Phoebe, why are there
men's shoes by the door?

11:47.111 --> 11:49.572
- Those are my shoes.
- Oh.

11:49.738 --> 11:52.867
Well, when you get over this breakup,
we need to go shopping.

11:53.450 --> 11:56.495
Look, Monica, I really appreciate
you checking in on me.

11:56.662 --> 11:59.123
- But I'm actually feeling a lot better.
- You are?

11:59.290 --> 12:01.750
Yeah, I just kind of want
to be alone right now.

12:04.336 --> 12:08.507
- Who's that?
- I ordered Chinese food.

12:10.718 --> 12:13.470
What are the chances?

12:14.054 --> 12:17.892
One billion Chinese people,
and they send Mike!

12:22.855 --> 12:25.149
- What are you doing here?
- Phoebe called me.

12:25.399 --> 12:27.902
- Phoebe!
- I'm sorry. I broke down.

12:28.068 --> 12:29.361
I wanted to see him.

12:29.528 --> 12:31.655
Damn it, Phoebe,
how did you even call him?

12:31.864 --> 12:34.116
There's a speakerphone
on the base unit.

12:34.325 --> 12:37.703
Base unit. Think, Monica, think!

12:37.953 --> 12:41.207
- Look, if I want to see Phoebe, and she...
- This doesn't concern you.

12:42.666 --> 12:46.045
Sorry. I guess I was thrown off
by the mention of my name.

12:47.796 --> 12:50.007
Look, guys, you can't do this.

12:50.174 --> 12:52.551
It's gonna make getting
over each other harder.

12:52.718 --> 12:56.889
Not if nothing happens.
Why can't we just hang out as friends?

12:58.432 --> 13:02.186
Sure. If you're just gonna hang out
as friends, then maybe I'll join you.

13:02.394 --> 13:04.021
I'm your friend and Mike's friend.

13:04.521 --> 13:05.731
Well...

13:08.359 --> 13:10.486
Sit down.

13:12.404 --> 13:15.950
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Make room for your friend.

13:26.335 --> 13:29.171
- So how have you been?
- I've been pretty good.

13:33.968 --> 13:37.930
- You look really beautiful.
- Thanks. You look good too.

13:38.097 --> 13:42.476
No, no, no. This is dangerous territory.
Keep it clean.

13:44.103 --> 13:45.688
So how's the piano playing going?

13:45.854 --> 13:48.816
Actually, I've been playing a lot
of love songs lately.

13:49.441 --> 13:53.320
- I've missed you.
- I've missed you too.

13:56.031 --> 14:00.953
You know, on the way over here,
I saw this drunk guy throw up.

14:02.329 --> 14:04.331
And then a pigeon ate it.

14:09.086 --> 14:10.587
Hey. Ross.

14:11.005 --> 14:13.632
Look, I just wanted to apologize.

14:14.216 --> 14:17.469
Don't tell me you actually made
those gay pictures of me.

14:17.636 --> 14:20.597
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Check this out.

14:20.806 --> 14:23.642
So that's what I'd look like
if I worked out.

14:24.768 --> 14:27.438
And was being serviced by a policeman.

14:28.522 --> 14:30.691
You're not gonna actually
send these out, are you?

14:30.899 --> 14:34.862
Actually, I don't need to, because your
little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work.

14:35.029 --> 14:36.780
Okay? There were no responses.

14:36.947 --> 14:39.700
Nobody posted anything on the website,
nobody called my parents...

14:39.867 --> 14:41.577
...so the joke, my friend, is on you.

14:41.744 --> 14:46.373
Nobody called, nobody wrote anything,
nobody cares that I'm dead.

14:50.669 --> 14:52.296
Oh, my God.

14:52.463 --> 14:56.216
- Nobody cares that I'm dead?
- Oh, come on, you know that's not true.

14:56.383 --> 14:58.802
What are you talking about?
You get 60 responses...

14:58.969 --> 15:00.679
...just for coming out of the closet.

15:00.846 --> 15:04.141
I didn't get one response, and I'm dead!

15:04.308 --> 15:08.729
Well, the gay community is a lot more
vocal than the dead community.

15:08.896 --> 15:14.777
I can't believe this. Not even my geology
lab partner. And I carried that guy.

15:14.943 --> 15:16.904
All right.
Look, let's think about this, okay?

15:17.071 --> 15:20.240
You think people are gonna disturb
your family at this tragic time?

15:20.407 --> 15:23.077
That people are gonna post condolences
on a website?

15:23.243 --> 15:25.329
This isn't about people
not caring that you're dead.

15:25.496 --> 15:29.416
This is about people not having
a decent outlet for their grief.

15:30.501 --> 15:33.128
- You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
- Right.

15:33.295 --> 15:35.672
Come on. I'm sure if you had a funeral
or memorial service...

15:35.839 --> 15:38.092
...tons of people would come.

15:38.675 --> 15:40.636
Exactly!

15:41.845 --> 15:43.430
Ross, what are you doing?

15:44.431 --> 15:46.683
You're having a memorial service
for yourself?

15:47.142 --> 15:50.229
No, that would be stupid.
You're having it for me.

15:51.563 --> 15:55.734
- Ross, don't press send. Don't press...
- No, too late. Too late. It's sent.

15:55.901 --> 15:58.862
Sorry, so is that picture
of you and the policeman.

16:01.115 --> 16:03.909
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap.
Have you seen Huggsy?

16:04.076 --> 16:05.994
Uh, original or crappy?

16:07.413 --> 16:09.957
- Original.
- No. Sorry. Haven't seen him.

16:10.165 --> 16:12.876
Then what's that big lump
under your covers'?

16:14.128 --> 16:17.506
- It's Monica, okay?
- That's not Monica!

16:17.673 --> 16:21.009
All right, fine! It's original Huggsy!

16:22.678 --> 16:25.222
I know Emma wants him,
but he's mine and I need him.

16:25.389 --> 16:28.016
She's being unreasonable.

16:28.308 --> 16:31.645
Joey, there is a reason that Emma
loves that stupid penguin so much!

16:31.854 --> 16:33.939
Oh, don't cover its ears!

16:34.648 --> 16:38.402
It's because it reminds her
of her Uncle Joey.

16:39.278 --> 16:40.988
- It does?
- Yeah.

16:41.155 --> 16:46.034
And she's comforted by him because
she loves her Uncle Joey so much.

16:46.243 --> 16:50.080
- Really? She loves me?
- Oh, yeah.

16:50.289 --> 16:53.250
But you know what?
If you need Huggsy, don't worry.

16:53.417 --> 16:56.628
Emma will totally understand.
I won't, but whatever.

16:56.837 --> 17:01.383
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, Rach.
I mean, if...

17:01.550 --> 17:05.179
If Huggsy means that much
to Emma, then...

17:05.596 --> 17:06.888
Well, she can have him.

17:07.263 --> 17:09.974
Oh, sweet, I knew Uncle Joey
would step up.

17:10.349 --> 17:14.146
- Look, Emma. Look who's back.
- No, forget it! Forget it! I can't do it!

17:14.354 --> 17:17.232
Are you...? You're gonna take
Huggsy away from a little child?

17:17.441 --> 17:19.818
How do you think I got him
in the first place?

17:22.404 --> 17:24.740
All right, you two.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

17:24.906 --> 17:26.992
I don't want anything going
on while I'm gone.

17:27.242 --> 17:29.203
Here's a few things you can discuss:

17:29.369 --> 17:33.624
Mucus, fungus, and the idea
of me and Ross doing it.

17:37.169 --> 17:38.587
I've missed you so much.

17:38.795 --> 17:42.633
I'm not gonna ask you to get back together.
I know we want different things, but...

17:42.799 --> 17:45.385
- Just to be with you one more night.
- I want that too.

17:45.552 --> 17:49.723
- But is that gonna make it too hard?
- It can't be any harder than this.

17:49.932 --> 17:53.435
I mean, if I had known the last time
I saw you would be the last time, I...

17:54.228 --> 17:57.231
I would have stopped to memorize
your face, the way you moved.

17:57.397 --> 17:59.608
Everything about you.

17:59.775 --> 18:03.862
If I had known the last time I kissed
you would be the last time...

18:04.029 --> 18:06.490
...I never would have stopped.

18:07.783 --> 18:10.327
Kiss him, you fool!

18:10.994 --> 18:13.413
- What?
- Didn't you hear that speech?

18:13.580 --> 18:15.832
If you don't kiss him, then I will.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.169
I missed you so much.

18:19.753 --> 18:23.382
- I knew you'd be here!
- Aw, crap.

18:23.549 --> 18:27.386
- Who is this?
- It's my friend Manny.

18:27.553 --> 18:30.556
I asked him to keep me away from you.

18:31.181 --> 18:35.561
- Hey, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe.
- Well, you're not doing a very good job.

18:36.144 --> 18:38.272
- Excuse me?
- What's with the kissing?

18:38.480 --> 18:41.024
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.

18:41.191 --> 18:44.361
Yeah, thank God you were here
to oversee all the kissing.

18:45.362 --> 18:48.031
- You didn't hear the speech.
- I've heard the speech.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.450
If he knew it was gonna
be the last time...

18:50.617 --> 18:52.995
Hey, it was very moving.
You're just heartless!

18:53.203 --> 18:55.581
- You're weak!
- You're weird!

18:55.789 --> 18:58.417
- Your pants are undone.
- Oh!

19:01.128 --> 19:03.255
Where'd they go?

19:04.131 --> 19:07.551
- Damn it.
- Well, we blew it.

19:07.718 --> 19:09.886
I blame myself.

19:10.304 --> 19:12.306
And I blame you too.

19:18.729 --> 19:22.441
It's been an hour, and not one
of my classmates has shown up?

19:22.733 --> 19:26.570
I tell you, when I actually die, some
people are gonna get seriously haunted.

19:29.072 --> 19:31.033
There you go. Someone came.

19:31.241 --> 19:33.452
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go hide.

19:33.619 --> 19:37.080
This is so exciting. My first mourner!

19:40.167 --> 19:42.502
Hi. Glad you could come.

19:42.669 --> 19:46.298
- Please come in.
- Hi. You're Chandler Bing, right?

19:46.465 --> 19:50.886
- I'm Tom Gordon. I was in your class.
- Oh, yes. Yes, let me take your coat.

19:51.053 --> 19:54.765
Thanks. Uh, I'm so sorry
about Ross, it's...

19:54.931 --> 19:57.601
No, at least he died doing what he loved.

19:57.768 --> 20:00.062
Watching blimps.

20:05.442 --> 20:07.944
- Who is it?
- You know some guy, Tom Gordon?

20:08.195 --> 20:09.571
I don't remember him.

20:09.738 --> 20:13.450
But then again, I touched so many lives.

20:15.744 --> 20:17.287
So did you know Ross well?

20:17.454 --> 20:20.624
Actually, I barely knew him.
I came because I heard Chandler's news.

20:20.791 --> 20:22.709
Do you know if he's seeing anyone?

20:27.047 --> 20:33.428
- Yes, he is. Me.
- What? You mean...? Oh.

20:33.845 --> 20:38.058
Can I ask you a personal question?
How do you shave your beard so close'?

20:40.435 --> 20:42.729
Okay, Tommy!
That's enough mourning for you.

20:42.896 --> 20:46.274
Here we go. Bye-bye. All right.

20:46.441 --> 20:50.237
- Hey, listen. Call me.
- Okay.

20:52.531 --> 20:57.160
- I'm dead and no one cares?
- I look like a man?

20:57.828 --> 21:00.747
Please, one ridiculous problem
at a time.

21:00.914 --> 21:03.709
This isn't ridiculous.
Look around, no one's here.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.629
You gave them one day's notice. Not
everyone checks the website every day.

21:07.796 --> 21:10.090
And Monica, it's probably
the way you stand!

21:12.509 --> 21:15.887
I guess you're right.
Still, somebody must have seen it.

21:16.054 --> 21:20.058
I mean, I went to that school for four years
and I didn't have an impact on anyone?

21:20.225 --> 21:23.520
Well, that's not true.
You had an impact on me.

21:23.687 --> 21:26.398
I mean, it's 15 years later
and we're still best friends.

21:26.565 --> 21:28.984
Doesn't that count for something?

21:33.238 --> 21:36.658
Oh, great, more party boys for Chandler.

21:36.825 --> 21:40.579
I'm sure it's somebody for you.
Now go hide.

21:44.249 --> 21:47.961
Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's
memorial service.

21:48.670 --> 21:52.340
- Kori? Kori Weston?
- Yeah.

21:52.758 --> 21:55.510
- You look amazing.
- And you are?

21:55.719 --> 21:59.264
Chandler. Chandler Bing.
And I'm not gay. I'm not gay at all.

21:59.431 --> 22:01.433
You are married, though.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.811
Don't listen to him.
He's in a really bad mood.

22:08.315 --> 22:11.902
I can't believe that Ross is gone.
It is just so sad.

22:12.110 --> 22:14.154
I didn't know Ross and you
were so close.

22:14.362 --> 22:18.200
Oh, we weren't. But we had one class
together. He was such a great guy.

22:18.366 --> 22:21.953
And he talked so passionately
about science.

22:22.120 --> 22:25.749
- I always remembered him.
- I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.

22:25.916 --> 22:27.709
And if heaven has a door...

22:27.876 --> 22:31.671
...I'm sure he's pressing his ear
up against it and listening intently.

22:33.507 --> 22:37.511
I thought so many times about
calling him and asking him out.

22:37.677 --> 22:39.554
I guess I really missed my chance.

22:39.971 --> 22:42.265
No, you didn't!

22:44.059 --> 22:45.852
I'm still alive!

22:47.103 --> 22:49.606
Kori, I know this
is a big surprise for you.

22:49.815 --> 22:53.944
It's a long story. But the things you
just said really made my day.

22:54.110 --> 22:56.279
The fact that you're here
means more to me...

22:56.446 --> 22:59.157
...than if this room were filled
with people.

22:59.825 --> 23:02.327
You sick freak! Who does that?

23:02.494 --> 23:04.120
I can't believe I had a crush on you.

23:09.584 --> 23:11.378
Did you hear that?

23:11.545 --> 23:15.257
Kori Weston had a crush on me!

23:22.722 --> 23:26.142
No, Mom, I am not dead.

23:26.601 --> 23:29.855
I know it's not something to kid about.

23:30.564 --> 23:34.943
It was just a practical joke between
Chandler and me, but it's over, okay?

23:35.443 --> 23:39.906
Actually, no. Even if I had died,
you would not be left childless.

23:41.533 --> 23:43.368
Monica?
