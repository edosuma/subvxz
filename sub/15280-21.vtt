WEBVTT

00:42.510 --> 00:45.070
EVERYTHING IS
GOING TO BE OK.

00:45.110 --> 00:49.274
I HAVE TO MEET A FRIEND,
SOMEONE WHO WILL HELP US.

00:58.120 --> 01:00.281
WE'VE GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE NOW.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.480
YOU PROMISED YOU WOULD
PROTECT MY CHILDREN.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.819
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M DOING.
JUST GET IN THE CAR, PLEASE.

01:04.860 --> 01:05.622
WE HAVE TO MOVE!

01:05.660 --> 01:07.753
YOU PROMISED YOU
WOULD KEEP US SAFE.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.596
AND I WILL.

01:08.630 --> 01:11.098
BUT YOU GOT TO TRUST ME
ONE MORE TIME.

01:11.130 --> 01:13.769
COME ON, KIDS. LET'S GO.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.438
EVERYBODY IN.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.773
EVERYBODY IN?

01:37.790 --> 01:40.497
YOU'LL NEVER FIND HER.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.201
I KNEW IT HAD TO BE YOU.

02:52.570 --> 02:56.802
I SEE THE PAPER
REPORTED THE DEATH
OF OUR MUTUAL FRIEND.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.877
I'LL WAIT FOR YOUR CALL.

03:25.270 --> 03:27.363
YOU CATCH HIM?

03:27.740 --> 03:29.833
ONLY AFTER HE
DROWNED 8 WOMEN.

03:29.870 --> 03:31.531
SICK BASTARD.

03:31.570 --> 03:32.377
HE WAS.

03:32.410 --> 03:36.278
AS OF 3 DAYS AGO,
JOHN SUMMERS WASN'T.

03:36.310 --> 03:40.713
IS THAT WHY YOU CALLED ME?

03:41.480 --> 03:45.644
HE WAS STRESSED, EXHAUSTED,
A LITTLE PARANOID MAYBE,

03:45.690 --> 03:47.351
BUT NOT SUICIDAL.

03:47.390 --> 03:49.927
I SIGNED HIM OFF
AS FIT FOR DUTY.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.951
SO YOU DID.

03:51.990 --> 03:53.628
AND SO HE WAS.

03:53.660 --> 03:55.753
IT WASN'T SUICIDE, WAS IT?

03:55.800 --> 03:56.892
PAPERS SAY IT WAS.

03:56.930 --> 03:59.990
INVESTIGATION TOO MESSY.
YOU MADE IT LOOK
LIKE SUICIDE.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.964
NOW, THAT IS A MESS.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.638
THIS? THAT'S
JUST CLEANING HOUSE.

04:05.670 --> 04:09.470
SO WHY DO YOU LOOK LIKE CRAP?

04:11.950 --> 04:14.669
YOU KNOW ME TOO WELL.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.712
IT WAS ONLY
THE PEOPLE IN MY UNIT

04:18.750 --> 04:20.559
THAT KNEW THAT
JOHN SUMMERS WAS CIA.

04:20.590 --> 04:24.321
AND MY BOSSES BELIEVE
THAT SOMEONE IN MY TEAM

04:24.360 --> 04:26.499
IS THE ONE
WHO HAD HIM KILLED.

04:26.530 --> 04:28.919
WE WANNA KNOW WHO AND WHY.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.621
A MOLE IN LANGLEY.

04:30.670 --> 04:31.523
IT LOOKS THAT WAY.

04:31.570 --> 04:33.936
AND I'M NOT HIGH ENOUGH
ON THE FOOD CHAIN

04:33.970 --> 04:36.803
TO DODGE THE BULLET ON THIS.

04:37.410 --> 04:40.470
NO, NO, JASON.
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

04:40.510 --> 04:44.469
NO JUDGE. NO JURY.
THIS IS STRICTLY IN-HOUSE.

04:44.510 --> 04:45.977
YOU WANT MY HELP?

04:46.010 --> 04:46.749
YEAH.

04:46.780 --> 04:49.886
THEN I NEED MY TEAM.

04:56.760 --> 05:01.527
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
TOUCHSTONE TELEVISION
PRODUCTIONS, LLC. AND CBS

05:24.650 --> 05:25.981
ALBERT EINSTEIN SAID,

05:26.020 --> 05:30.354
"WHOEVER SETS HIMSELF UP
AS JUDGE IN THE FIELD
OF TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE

05:30.390 --> 05:33.427
IS SHIPWRECKED
BY THE LAUGHTER OF THE GODS."

05:33.460 --> 05:36.122
HE WAS CIA ESCORT, OK?

05:36.160 --> 05:38.697
IT'S WEIRD,
A LITTLE SCARY.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.061
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE
THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

05:40.100 --> 05:44.059
CALL ME CYNICAL,
BUT CONSIDERING IT'S 2 A.M.,
I DOUBT IT'S GOOD NEWS.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.499
YOU ARE A GENIUS.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.077
THE CIA'S
COUNTERTERRORISM UNIT
IS ENGAGED IN A MISSION

05:54.120 --> 05:55.439
TO SAVE ONE
OF ITS INFORMANTS.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.380
THEY SUSPECT ONE
OF THEIR AGENTS IS A MOLE.

05:57.420 --> 05:59.149
UNTIL THE IDENTITY OF
THAT MOLE IS DISCOVERED,

05:59.190 --> 06:00.350
THEY'VE LOCKED DOWN
THE UNIT.

06:00.390 --> 06:04.121
THIS GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY
TO PROFILE THE UNSUB UP CLOSE.

06:04.160 --> 06:04.785
GO AHEAD.

06:04.830 --> 06:06.058
LET'S START
THE VIDEO FEED.

06:06.090 --> 06:09.867
JOHN SUMMERS WAS
THE CIA'S BEST FIELD AGENT
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

06:09.900 --> 06:12.118
3 NIGHTS AGO, HE WAS FOUND
IN HIS HOME IN WASHINGTON.

06:12.170 --> 06:13.933
HE'D BEEN TORTURED
AND MURDERED.

06:13.970 --> 06:16.063
THE CIA MADE IT
LOOK LIKE SUICIDE.

06:16.100 --> 06:19.069
HOW'D YOU LIKE
TO HAVE THAT JOB?

06:21.480 --> 06:24.074
GUYS, LOOK
AT THE WOUND PATTERNS.

06:24.110 --> 06:27.170
THEY COME
FROM 2 DISTINCT ANGLES.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.039
DIFFERENT HEIGHTS.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.082
ONE'S RIGHT-HANDED
AND ONE'S LEFT-HANDED.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.850
LOOKS TO ME
LIKE HE WAS TORTURED
BY MORE THAN 2 PEOPLE.

06:32.890 --> 06:34.517
HOTCH, WHAT WAS
SUMMERS WORKING ON?

06:34.560 --> 06:38.155
AALIYAH NADIR
HAD BEEN BEATEN
AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED

06:38.190 --> 06:39.418
AT THE HANDS OF HER HUSBAND,
HASSAN NADIR.

06:39.460 --> 06:42.861
THAT'S HOW SUMMERS
FLIPPED HER AND GOT HER
TO WORK FOR THE CIA.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.424
WHAT'S THE HUSBAND'S STORY?

06:44.470 --> 06:46.097
HE'S A DIPLOMAT
FOR THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT,

06:46.130 --> 06:49.702
BUT HE'S A FUND-RAISER
FOR MAJOR TERRORIST
ORGANIZATIONS.

06:49.740 --> 06:51.139
AALIYAH GAVE
SUMMERS INTELLIGENCE

06:51.170 --> 06:52.876
ON TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS

06:52.910 --> 06:55.799
THE CIA HAD NEVER
BEEN ABLE TO PENETRATE,

06:55.840 --> 06:58.775
ORGANIZATIONS HASSAN,
HER HUSBAND,

06:58.810 --> 06:59.845
FUNNELED MONEY TO.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.211
AND HASSAN REALIZED
HE HAD A LEAK?

07:01.250 --> 07:02.649
YES, BUT HE
DIDN'T KNOW WHO.

07:02.690 --> 07:06.979
FOR AALIYAH'S PROTECTION,
SUMMERS NEVER REVEALED
HER IDENTITY TO THE CIA

07:07.020 --> 07:08.453
UNTIL ABOUT 8 WEEKS AGO.

07:08.490 --> 07:09.855
CIA ARRANGED PAPERS FOR HER,

07:09.890 --> 07:12.859
AND SUMMERS BROUGHT HER
AND HER CHILDREN TO THE US.
ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

07:12.900 --> 07:13.821
ONLY SUMMERS KNEW
WHERE HE HID HER.

07:13.860 --> 07:16.090
WHAT DID HASSAN THINK
HAPPENED TO HIS FAMILY?

07:16.130 --> 07:18.963
CAR ACCIDENT. BODIES
TOO DISFIGURED TO IDENTIFY.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.831
ONLY THE CIA
KNEW IT WAS STAGED

07:20.870 --> 07:24.135
UNTIL HASSAN ARRIVED
IN WASHINGTON LAST WEEK
UNDER DIPLOMATIC COVER.

07:24.170 --> 07:27.628
ONLY SOMEONE IN THIS UNIT
COULD HAVE GIVEN
HASSAN INFORMATION

07:27.680 --> 07:28.533
ABOUT HIS FAMILY.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.798
AND NOW HE'S HERE
LOOKING FOR HER. WHY US?

07:30.850 --> 07:34.172
OVER THE YEARS,
I'VE CONDUCTED
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS

07:34.220 --> 07:36.176
ON EVERY FIELD AGENT
IN THAT UNIT.

07:36.220 --> 07:37.881
YOU WORKED FOR THE CIA?

07:37.920 --> 07:38.909
NOT OFFICIALLY.

07:38.950 --> 07:40.918
THE TRAIN'S RUNNING.
AND IF WE STOP
THIS MISSION,

07:40.960 --> 07:45.056
EVEN FOR A SECOND,
AALIYAH AND HER CHILDREN
ARE AS GOOD AS DEAD.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.650
EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE OK.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.589
WE'LL BE OUT OF HERE SOON.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.733
HE'S GOING
TO COME BACK FOR US.

07:53.770 --> 07:58.537
WE JUST ALL HAVE
TO BE VERY BRAVE.

07:58.570 --> 08:02.973
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
TRY TO SLEEP.

08:12.790 --> 08:14.280
DON'T REMOVE YOUR FIREARM.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.208
U.S. SOIL.
FEDERAL BUILDING.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.182
JUST YOUR CELL PHONES.
NON-NEGOTIABLE.

08:18.230 --> 08:19.527
THE MOMENT
WE WALK IN THERE,

08:19.560 --> 08:24.497
THE UNSUB'S GONNA KNOW
WE GOT HIM CORNERED.
WE DON'T HAND JACK HIM.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.140
HEY.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.514
SPECIAL AGENT HOTCHNER.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.619
OH, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE
AND YOUR TEAM, TOO.

08:48.660 --> 08:51.879
I'VE GOT THE PERSONNEL FILES
ALL SET UP FOR YOU GUYS.

08:51.930 --> 08:54.228
VIDEO, WHATNOT. IT'S ALL THERE
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

08:54.260 --> 08:59.266
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,
FEEL FREE TO TALK TO
MY SENIOR OFFICERS.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.267
THIS IS GINA SANCHEZ.

09:00.300 --> 09:03.303
SHE'S THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR
OF FIELD OPERATIONS.

09:03.340 --> 09:05.763
AND THAT GUY UP THERE
IS KRUGER SPENCE,

09:05.810 --> 09:07.300
THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
OF OPERATIONS.

09:07.340 --> 09:11.743
THE LADY WITH HIM
IS HIS SECOND IN COMMAND,
OLIVIA HOPKINS.

09:11.780 --> 09:13.645
AND THANK YOU FOR COMING.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.649
YOU NEVER MENTIONED
BRUNO HAWKS.

09:16.690 --> 09:17.714
YOU NEVER ASKED.

09:17.750 --> 09:20.059
HOW LONG HAVE YOU UNOFFICIALLY
BEEN WORKING FOR CIA?

09:20.090 --> 09:22.650
LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW WHO
AND WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.

09:22.690 --> 09:26.592
IF I MAY ASK, SIR--
I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME,
NATHAN--

09:26.630 --> 09:29.292
THE THING THAT I DON'T GET
IS OUR TEAM'S THERE.

09:29.330 --> 09:31.696
WHY CAN'T WE GO
TO LANGLEY?

09:31.730 --> 09:34.267
DO I LOOK LIKE A THREAT
TO NATIONAL SECURITY
TO YOU? SERIOUSLY.

09:34.300 --> 09:35.892
YOUR NAME IS ON A LIST.

09:35.940 --> 09:37.828
A LIST I WORK FOR THE FBI,

09:37.870 --> 09:39.599
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
I'M ON A LIST

09:39.640 --> 09:41.870
THAT SAYS I CAN'T GO
TO THE CIA?

09:41.910 --> 09:43.241
YOU'RE ON A LIST.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.943
UH, GARCIA.

09:58.890 --> 10:01.290
YOU DO KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS.

10:01.330 --> 10:02.126
WHAT?

10:02.160 --> 10:03.263
WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT

10:03.300 --> 10:05.621
WHETHER
PRINCESS DIANA'S DEATH
WAS REALLY AN ACCIDENT.

10:05.670 --> 10:10.403
I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY
THE KIND OF THING
THAT GOT YOU ON THEIR LIST.

10:16.310 --> 10:19.746
OK, WE GOT A FULL ROSTER
OF ALL THE PLAYERS HERE,

10:19.780 --> 10:22.146
INCLUDING SUMMERS.
HOW MANY IN TOTAL?

10:22.180 --> 10:25.741
IN BRUNO'S DEPARTMENT. 22.

10:25.790 --> 10:28.987
21 AND 22
ARE HERE WITH US.

10:29.020 --> 10:31.329
IN THE ROOM.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.023
WHAT IF IT'S ONE OF THEM?

10:45.240 --> 10:50.007
WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHAT
THE CIA CLASSIFIES
A TYPE-A PERSONALITY.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.745
OVERACHIEVER,
HIGHLY ADAPTABLE,

10:51.780 --> 10:53.668
WELL EDUCATED,
VIRTUALLY UNSHAKABLE.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.041
MANIPULATIVE ENOUGH
TO PERSUADE
A LOYAL FOREIGN NATIONAL

10:56.080 --> 10:58.787
TO BETRAY THEIR COUNTRY
OR A WIFE TO BETRAY HER HUSBAND.

10:58.820 --> 11:02.381
MOST IMPORTANTLY,
THIS UNSUB LONG AGO
ACCEPTED THE REALITY

11:02.420 --> 11:05.878
THEY WILL BE SUMMARILY
EXECUTED IF CAUGHT.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.394
LIFE MEANS NOTHING
TO THIS UNSUB.

11:10.430 --> 11:13.194
NOT HIS OWN LIFE.
NOT HIS FAMILY'S.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.334
NOT HIS COLLEAGUES.
CERTAINLY NOT OURS.
AND CERTAINLY NOT THEIRS.

11:16.370 --> 11:19.908
ONE OF THOSE AGENTS
TURNED AGAINST EVERYTHING
THEY BELIEVE IN. WHY?

11:19.940 --> 11:24.070
WELL, HE STOPPED BELIEVING.
MAYBE IT WAS ABOUT IDEOLOGY.

11:24.110 --> 11:25.179
WE NEED TO FIND
THE STRESSOR,

11:25.210 --> 11:28.316
A MAJOR EVENT
THAT CAUSED HIM
TO TURN LOVE, REVENGE,

11:28.350 --> 11:29.908
ECONOMICS, IDEOLOGY.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.043
THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY'S MANTRA SAYS,

11:32.090 --> 11:36.459
"INCREASE THE PARAMETER
OF YOUR ENEMIES' PARANOIA."

11:37.190 --> 11:40.091
RIGHT NOW
WE'RE THE ENEMY.

11:40.130 --> 11:42.997
WHATEVER YOU SEE
OR ARE TOLD,

11:43.030 --> 11:44.497
PLEASE TRUST
NO ONE BUT ME.

11:44.530 --> 11:48.967
GIDEON, YOU'RE
GONNA WANT TO TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.

11:49.000 --> 11:49.534
WHAT IS IT?

11:49.570 --> 11:51.902
IT'S YOU. IT'S YOUR NAME

11:51.940 --> 11:53.271
NEXT TO A WHOLE
SLEW OF MPEGS.

11:53.310 --> 11:57.849
THERE'S ONE THAT
SAYS "JOHN SUMMERS."
IT'S 3 HOURS LONG.

12:07.290 --> 12:08.917
WHEN WAS THIS?

12:08.960 --> 12:11.383
3 DAYS
BEFORE HE WAS KILLED.

12:11.430 --> 12:14.399
WHO CALLED THIS MEETING?

12:14.430 --> 12:17.797
DOES IT MATTER?

12:17.830 --> 12:19.889
EVERY DETAIL MATTERS.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.430
WHY?

12:21.470 --> 12:23.938
IT CAN ONLY BE
1 OF 4 PEOPLE.

12:23.970 --> 12:26.803
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT?

12:26.840 --> 12:28.330
WHOEVER REQUESTED THIS

12:28.380 --> 12:32.271
WANTED MORE THAN JUST
AN EVAL FROM YOU.

12:33.580 --> 12:36.447
DID YOU KNOW
THEY WERE FILMING YOU?

12:36.480 --> 12:37.549
I ASSUMED THEY WERE.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.115
TAKING IN
ALL FACTORS DISCUSSED--

12:40.160 --> 12:41.957
AGE, RANK,
AND FIELD STATUS--

12:41.990 --> 12:43.924
AND IF YOU ELIMINATED
ALL NON-FIELD AGENTS,

12:43.960 --> 12:46.849
WE'RE LEFT WITH A TOTAL
OF 16 CANDIDATES.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.460
ALL OF WHOM
ARE IN THIS UNIT.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.890
WE HAVE TO ASSUME THE MOLE
HAS AN EXIT STRATEGY.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.431
ONLY NOW WE'RE
BLOCKING THE EXIT,

12:55.470 --> 12:58.860
AND THE ONLY WAY OUT
IS THROUGH US.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.468
WE ALL KNOW
WHY B.A.U. ARE HERE.

13:04.510 --> 13:06.819
THEY HAVE THEIR JOB
AND WE HAVE OURS.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.943
AND WE'RE DOWN
TO THE WIRE ON THIS.

13:08.980 --> 13:10.447
AALIYAH NADIR
RISKED EVERYTHING,

13:10.490 --> 13:14.586
AND NOW SHE AND
HER CHILDREN DESERVE
OUR FULLEST ATTENTION.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.929
LET'S FIND HER.

13:20.030 --> 13:20.951
AGENT GIDEON.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.888
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

13:22.930 --> 13:25.160
YOU'RE NOT
A VERY GOOD LIAR.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.064
I WASN'T LYING.

13:26.100 --> 13:28.136
YOUR EVALUATION
TOOK ME OUT OF THE FIELD.

13:28.170 --> 13:29.330
I SIMPLY WROTE THE TRUTH.

13:29.370 --> 13:31.463
YOU'RE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT.
YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLY
STRONG-WILLED.

13:31.510 --> 13:34.900
THERE'S GONNA COME A TIME
WHEN YOU CAN'T
FOLLOW ORDERS.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.407
IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.509
IT WILL.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.802
YOU'RE WRONG.

13:46.650 --> 13:49.380
WE THINK THE AGENT
WHO'S TIPPING OFF HASSAN

13:49.420 --> 13:51.422
MAY HAVE HAD SOME KIND
OF EXTREME EVENT
IN THEIR LIFE.

13:51.460 --> 13:54.520
SOMETHING THAT
DISTORTED OR REDEFINED
THEIR BELIEF SYSTEM.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.427
EVERY AGENT UNDERGOES
REGULAR PSYCH EVALS.
YOU KNOW THAT.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.620
THEY'RE TRAINED TO COPE
WITH EXTREME EVENTS.

13:59.670 --> 14:02.138
WHATEVER TURNED THIS AGENT,
YOU CAN'T TRAIN FOR.

14:02.170 --> 14:03.330
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO EVERYTHING I HAVE.

14:03.370 --> 14:05.861
EVERY OP UNDERTAKEN
BY THESE GUYS IS ON FILE.

14:05.910 --> 14:07.036
WHAT ABOUT THE ONES
THAT AREN'T ON FILE?

14:07.080 --> 14:08.479
LIKE THE WIRETAPS
OF THE SAUDI EMBASSY.

14:08.510 --> 14:09.738
THOSE DON'T EVEN EXIST.

14:09.780 --> 14:12.044
HOW LONG HAS YOUR DEPARTMENT
BEEN RUNNING OPERATIONS
IN RIYADH?

14:12.080 --> 14:14.469
WE HAVE A DECLARED
PRESENCE IN RIYADH

14:14.520 --> 14:16.943
MONITORING
U.S. INTERESTS THERE.

14:16.990 --> 14:17.945
YOU KNOW THAT.

14:17.990 --> 14:22.859
NOW, IF THAT'S ALL,
I HAVE AN INFORMANT TO SEE.

14:23.490 --> 14:27.529
HEY, GUYS,
TAKE A LOOK AT SOMETHING.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.697
RIGHT THERE.

14:28.730 --> 14:32.393
THAT'S A WOMAN SITTING
IN THE PASSENGER SEAT
OF THAT CAR.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.867
LOOKS A LOT
LIKE AALIYAH.

14:37.910 --> 14:42.438
WHY WOULD HE LEAVE THEM
IN THE CAR UNLESS HE KNEW
HE WERE BEING VIDEOTAPED?

14:44.350 --> 14:46.648
WHO CALLED
THIS MEETING?

14:46.680 --> 14:49.911
DOES THAT MATTER?

14:50.990 --> 14:52.639
EVERY DETAIL MATTERS.

14:52.690 --> 14:54.112
WHY?

14:54.160 --> 14:57.084
IT CAN ONLY BE
1 OF 4 PEOPLE.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.621
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
ANYONE IN THIS DIVISION

14:59.660 --> 15:02.549
COULD HAVE INSISTED
ON AN EVAL.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.364
WHY NARROW IT
DOWN TO 4?

15:05.400 --> 15:07.595
WELL, HE RIGHTLY SUSPECT ED
HASSAN CAME TO THE U.S.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.232
BECAUSE HE KNEW
HIS WIFE WAS ALIVE.

15:09.270 --> 15:11.033
AND THAT SOMEONE
IN THIS AGENCY
WAS WORKING FOR HASSAN.

15:11.070 --> 15:14.506
IF WE DON'T
DISCOVER WHO THE MOLE IS
BEFORE THEY FIND HER,

15:14.540 --> 15:17.008
SHE AND THE KIDS ARE DEAD.

15:17.050 --> 15:17.641
GARCIA.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.443
RIGHT HERE, BOSS.

15:19.480 --> 15:20.970
HOW MANY AGENTS IN THIS UNIT

15:21.020 --> 15:24.649
WERE ACTUALLY IN SAUDI
MONITORING U.S. INTERESTS?

15:24.690 --> 15:25.714
4.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.251
LET ME GUESS.

15:27.290 --> 15:29.019
BRUNO HAWKS, GINA SANCHEZ,

15:29.060 --> 15:32.359
OLIVIA HOPKINS,
AND KRUGER SPENCE.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.049
4 FOR 4.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.524
SEE WHAT ELSE
IS ON THE TAPE.

15:38.600 --> 15:43.628
JOHN SUMMERS WOULD HAVE ONLY
TRUSTED SEASONED AGENTS,

15:43.670 --> 15:46.138
OF WHICH IN THIS UNIT
THERE ARE ONLY 4.

15:46.170 --> 15:50.448
HE GUESSED THAT THE MOLE
HAD TO HAVE BEEN ONE
OF HIS 4 BOSSES.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.539
BEFORE HE PUT IN
FOR AALIYAH'S EXTRACTION,

15:52.580 --> 15:53.979
HE WANTED TO KNOW
WHICH ONE NOT TO ASK.

15:54.020 --> 15:58.116
WE NEED TO MATCH UP
WITH THEM, ONE-ON-ONE.

15:58.150 --> 15:59.686
KRUGER SPENCE,

15:59.720 --> 16:02.553
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
OF OPERATIONS.

16:02.590 --> 16:06.583
RECRUITED AT THE AGE OF 18
AI-TER GRADUATING FROM M.I.T.

16:06.630 --> 16:09.394
IT SAYS HERE
HAD 6 YEARS EXPERIENCE

16:09.430 --> 16:11.295
AS A WEAPONS
SYSTEMS DESIGNER

16:11.330 --> 16:12.695
AND AN I.Q. OF 197.

16:12.730 --> 16:14.595
HE BUTTED UP
AGAINST THE SYSTEM

16:14.640 --> 16:15.766
AND DIDN'T DEAL
WITH AUTHORITY.

16:15.800 --> 16:19.008
THEY MOVED HIM
INTO FIELD OPERATIONS
IN CHINA FOR 8 YEARS

16:19.040 --> 16:20.632
BEFORE
TRANSFERRING HIM HERE.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.103
OLIVIA HOPKINS,
DIVORCED MOTHER OF 2.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.472
SHE SPENT 9 YEARS
IN FIELD OPERATIONS IN EUROPE.

16:26.510 --> 16:30.389
SHE ALSO VISITED RIYADH
WITH KRUGER.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.115
I GOT
GINA SANCHEZ.

16:32.150 --> 16:33.378
WEST POINT GRADUATE.

16:33.420 --> 16:34.819
BLACK BELT
IN 2 MARTIAL ARTS.

16:34.860 --> 16:38.682
SERVED IN IRAQ DOING
PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS
WITH MILITARY INTELLIGENCE.

16:38.730 --> 16:40.595
SHE JOINED THE CIA
5 YEARS AGO.

16:40.630 --> 16:43.190
SPEAKS 3 LANGUAGES
INCLUDING ARABIC.

16:43.230 --> 16:45.721
BRUNO HAWKS,
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS.

16:45.770 --> 16:48.637
EXTENSIVE FIELD OPS
IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND EUROPE.

16:48.670 --> 16:52.333
DID HIS MILITARY SERVICE
WITH JASON GIDEON.

16:52.770 --> 16:55.739
ONE THING I'VE LEARNED OVER
THE YEARS PROFILING CIA AGENTS,

16:55.780 --> 17:00.672
SPIES ARE SOME OF THE SMARTEST
LIARS IN THE WORLD.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.018
BE SMARTER.

17:14.130 --> 17:16.496
I'M THIRSTY.

17:22.640 --> 17:23.436
DRINK.

17:23.470 --> 17:25.665
SHARE THE LAST OF IT
WITH YOUR SISTER.

17:25.710 --> 17:28.338
IT'S OK.
HE CAN HAVE IT.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.247
I'M NOT EVEN THAT THIRSTY.

17:55.570 --> 17:59.631
WE CAN'T CIRCULATE
A PHOTO OF A WOMAN
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD.

17:59.670 --> 18:00.637
I REALIZE THAT, BUT--

18:00.680 --> 18:02.739
I APPRECIATE YOU HAVE
A JOB TO DO, BUT SO DO I.

18:02.780 --> 18:06.648
START LOOKING
WHERE AALIYAH WOULD FEEL
THE MOST COMFORTABLE.

18:06.680 --> 18:07.772
ARAB-POPULATED AREAS.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.278
ACTUALLY, YOU
MIGHT WAN NA START
BY PROFILING SUMMERS.

18:11.320 --> 18:12.617
BE MY GUEST.

18:12.650 --> 18:16.882
AALIYAH'S ABOUT
TO BE BRUTALLY MURDERED
IN FRONT OF HER CHILDREN.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.558
GOT NOTHING?

18:18.590 --> 18:19.488
OK.

18:19.530 --> 18:22.693
WHERE WERE WE? LET'S PUT
SOME TEAMS TOGETHER.

18:22.730 --> 18:25.119
SUMMERS WAS OBSESSED
WITH HIS OWN SECURITY.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.159
AREN'T WE ALL?

18:26.200 --> 18:27.633
HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT MONEY
OR POSSESSION OR FAMILY.

18:27.670 --> 18:28.739
ALL HE CARED ABOUT
WAS HIS JOB.

18:28.770 --> 18:30.431
HE WAS A CLASSIC
CONTROL FREAK,
A METICULOUS PARANOID.

18:30.470 --> 18:32.802
A LOANER WHO CHOSE TO LIVE
OUTSIDE THE COMMUNITY.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.831
IN AN ENVIRONMENT
THAT HE COULD CONTROL.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.771
ALL RIGHT. SO HE WOULD
HAVE PLACED AALIYAH
OUTSIDE THE COMMUNITY

18:38.810 --> 18:42.678
IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT
ONLY HE COULD CONTROL
AND HAVE ACCESS TO.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.119
MAYBE. ON THE OTHER
HAND, HE MIGHT--

18:44.150 --> 18:48.211
NEW DEAL. I WANT YOU
TO SEARCH THE AREAS
SURROUNDING SUMMERS' APARTMENT.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.478
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR INDUSTRIAL SIGHTS,

18:50.530 --> 18:53.454
STORAGE SPACES, WAREHOUSES.

18:55.730 --> 18:59.166
THAT'S GOOD. THAN KS.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.232
I DON'T THINK
I COULD HAVE A JOB

19:02.270 --> 19:04.568
WHERE I HAD TO SIT
AND TALK TO PEOPLE ALL DAY.

19:04.610 --> 19:07.238
OK, WAIT A MINUTE.
IT'S NOT ALL PSYCHOBABBLE.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.578
I GET MY FAIR SHARE
OF ACTION.

19:09.610 --> 19:10.872
I'M SURE YOU DO.

19:10.910 --> 19:13.845
HERE'S SOMETHING YOU
MIGHT FIND INTERESTING.

19:13.880 --> 19:17.486
JOYSTICK, COME AROUND
30 DEGREES,

19:17.520 --> 19:19.579
15 BY 13 NORTH.

19:19.620 --> 19:22.612
ZOOM IN 2 MILES.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.890
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.890
THAT LOOKS
LIKE MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

19:30.930 --> 19:33.797
THAT IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD.
THAT'S MY HOUSE.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.592
THAT'S MY BIKE.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.369
YOU HAVE A DOG.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.867
YEAH, YEAH, I GOT A DOG.

19:39.910 --> 19:41.832
THAT'S CLOONEY.

19:41.880 --> 19:45.646
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
CLOONEY'S ON THE COUCH.

19:46.710 --> 19:51.386
OK. SO YOU KNOW
WHERE I LIVE. I LIKE THAT.

19:56.460 --> 19:59.884
YOU ALSO KNEW
WHERE SUMMERS LIVED.

19:59.930 --> 20:00.726
THAT'S MY JOB.

20:00.760 --> 20:04.526
YOUR JOB TO MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE SUICIDE?

20:04.570 --> 20:07.539
YOU STOOD OVER THE DEAD BODY
OF A FRIEND AND A COLLEAGUE.

20:07.570 --> 20:12.269
YOU STUCK
A SHOTGUN IN HIS MOUTH
AND YOU PULLED THE TRIGGER.

20:12.310 --> 20:13.834
YEP.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.838
MUST TAKE
A PSYCHOLOGICAL TOLL, NO?

20:19.010 --> 20:21.547
LET'S GET ONE THING CLEAR.

20:21.580 --> 20:24.947
WE ALL WRITE A LETTER JUST
LIKE THE ONE SUMMERS WROTE.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.912
A SUICIDE NOTE?

20:26.950 --> 20:28.952
THAT DOESN'T MESS WITH YOUR
MIND JUST A LITTLE BIT?

20:28.990 --> 20:31.629
I'M NEITHER
DISILLUSIONED OR CONFUSED

20:31.660 --> 20:34.857
ABOUT WHAT I AM, WHAT I DO
OR WHAT I HAVE DONE.

20:34.900 --> 20:35.821
SOMEBODY HERE IS.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.966
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY
RAT OUT THEIR OWN PEOPLE?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.992
YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK THEM.

20:48.910 --> 20:51.743
CIA LOOKS MUCH
LIKE THE FBI.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.668
THIS IS A REAL
BOY'S CLUB.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.972
MUST BE TOUGH
BEING A WOMAN HERE.

20:56.020 --> 20:57.715
GET TO THE POINT, AGENT.

20:57.750 --> 20:58.944
DIVORCED. LOST CUSTODY
OF YOUR KIDS.

20:58.990 --> 21:00.753
THAT DIDN'T HELP
YOUR CAREER, HUH?

21:00.790 --> 21:02.815
ARE YOU INTERROGATING ME?
JUST QUESTIONS.

21:02.860 --> 21:05.351
YOU WANT ANSWERS,
LOOK IN MY FILE.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.459
I DID.

21:06.490 --> 21:08.697
DURING AN OPERATION IN EUROPE,
YOU WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE.

21:08.730 --> 21:09.924
FOR WHICH
I RECEIVED COUNSELING.

21:09.960 --> 21:14.033
BUT IT DIDN'T HELP.
YOUR MARRIAGE BUSTED UP
PRETTY QUICKLY.

21:14.070 --> 21:16.061
HOW DOES THIS HELP YOU?

21:16.100 --> 21:17.260
IT WOULD TAKE A MAJOR EVENT

21:17.310 --> 21:20.438
FOR SOMEONE TO TURN AGAINST
THEIR COUNTRY, DON'T YOU THINK?

21:20.480 --> 21:22.072
A MAJOR EVENT LIKE WHAT?

21:22.110 --> 21:27.275
LIKE ONE THAT'S
NOT IN ANY FILE.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.711
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU OVER THERE?

21:31.750 --> 21:32.910
THEY ATTACK YOU?

21:32.950 --> 21:35.953
THEY RAPE YOU?

21:37.090 --> 21:37.829
OLIVIA.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.828
THAT'S ENOUGH.

21:39.860 --> 21:41.953
THIS IS IN VIOLATION
OF HER CIVIL RIGHTS.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.094
UNTIL THEY FIND THE SLEEPER
AND WE FIND AALIYAH,

21:45.130 --> 21:46.893
ALL RIGHTS ARE REVOKED.

21:46.930 --> 21:51.560
WHERE WERE YOU ON THE NIGHT
THAT SUMMERS WAS MURDERED?

21:52.810 --> 21:54.072
I WAS WITH HER.

21:54.110 --> 21:56.999
IN HER APARTMENT.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.101
WELL, YOU'RE
A MARRIED MAN.

21:59.150 --> 22:03.940
AT SOME POINT YOU MUST
HAVE LEI-T TO GET BACK
TO YOUR WIFE, RIGHT?

22:09.020 --> 22:11.079
YOU WAKE TO AN EMPTY BED?

22:11.130 --> 22:12.950
YES.

22:12.990 --> 22:15.322
I DID.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.669
ARE WE DONE HERE?

22:18.700 --> 22:22.067
30 AM.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.603
WE ALL KNOW NONE OF THIS
WILL EVER REACH A COURT.

22:24.640 --> 22:29.509
IF YOU WAN NA ARREST US
FOR HAVING AN AFFAIR,
BE MY GUEST.

22:29.780 --> 22:32.647
I'LL DEAL WITH YOU TWO LATER.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.052
OLIVIA.

23:00.170 --> 23:03.503
RIYADH, 2003.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.445
WHEN I SAW
THE CCTV MONITORS WERE DOWN

23:44.490 --> 23:45.616
AND OLIVIA HADN'T RETURNED,

23:45.650 --> 23:49.108
I THOUGHT I'D BETTER
COME LOOKING FOR HER.

23:54.730 --> 23:56.618
HAVE ANY AGENTS
SEEN THE BODY?

23:56.660 --> 23:59.094
GOOD. WE CAN USE THIS
TO OUR ADVANTAGE

23:59.130 --> 24:01.792
TO GET THE OTHERS.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.468
WHAT

24:05.510 --> 24:07.000
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

24:07.040 --> 24:09.634
YOU'RE PULLING US AWAY
FROM OUR ASSIGNMENTS?

24:09.680 --> 24:11.648
THERE'S A WOMAN OUT THERE
WHOSE LIFE DEPENDS ON US.

24:11.680 --> 24:12.942
WHERE'S OLIVIA?

24:12.980 --> 24:16.677
OLIVIA HOPKINS WAS
MURDERED 10 MINUTES AGO.
HER NECK WAS SNAPPED.

24:16.720 --> 24:20.588
JUST LIKE
JOHN SUMMERS.

24:20.920 --> 24:24.083
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

24:26.530 --> 24:27.849
YOU'RE LYING.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.767
WHERE IS SHE?

24:32.000 --> 24:38.007
LOOK, PEOPLE DON'T JUST
GET MURDERED INSIDE THE CIA.

24:41.810 --> 24:43.949
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

24:43.980 --> 24:45.800
I REALIZE
THE ENORMITY OF THIS,

24:45.850 --> 24:49.775
BUT HASSAN NADIR
IS STILL OUT THERE
LOOKING TO KILL HIS WIFE,

24:49.820 --> 24:52.789
AND I NEED
EVERY AGENT ON THIS.

25:11.810 --> 25:14.734
WHAT DO YOU
THINK IT WOULD TAKE

25:14.780 --> 25:16.873
FOR SOMEBODY TO BETRAY
THEIR COUNTRY?

25:16.910 --> 25:20.869
IF I KNEW THAT,
YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.

25:20.920 --> 25:24.014
OR IS THIS THE PART
WHERE YOU PROFILE ME?

25:24.050 --> 25:29.158
I'VE DONE THAT
FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND FOR FREE.

25:30.890 --> 25:32.187
WHAT DID YOU COME UP WITH?

25:32.230 --> 25:35.859
WELL, YOU DON'T SMILE
AS MUCH AS YOU USED TO,

25:35.900 --> 25:38.721
BUT THE ROGAINE'S WORKING.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.788
YOU NEED TO QUIT
YOUR DAY JOB.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.068
YOU'VE STRIVED
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE

25:43.100 --> 25:45.068
JUST TO SEEK THE APPROVAL
OF YOUR FATHER.

25:45.110 --> 25:48.204
OBSESSIVELY TRIED NOT TO MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKES HE MADE.

25:48.240 --> 25:52.700
THE EMOTIONAL COST WIPES
THE SMILE OFF YOUR FACE.

25:53.150 --> 25:54.242
YOU KNOW, MY KIDS,

25:54.280 --> 25:57.044
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO OR
WHAT THEIR FATHER REALLY IS.

25:57.080 --> 26:02.211
BUT THEY KNOW THERE'S
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
YOU WOULDN'T DO FOR THEM.

26:02.260 --> 26:03.921
WHO SAYS, YOU KNOW,

26:03.960 --> 26:08.158
KIDS NEED TO KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT US?

26:08.930 --> 26:13.799
TRUST ME.
WE'RE NOT THAT INTERESTING.

26:15.040 --> 26:18.066
WHO DO YOU THINK IT IS?

26:18.370 --> 26:22.033
I'M SO CLOSE TO IT, JASON,
I HONESTLY CAN'T TELL.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.140
I WILL SAY THIS.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

26:25.180 --> 26:26.977
YOU FEELING OK?

26:27.010 --> 26:29.911
I MEAN, YOU LOST
2 OF YOUR PEOPLE--

26:29.950 --> 26:32.214
2 COLLEAGUES, 2 FRIENDS.

26:32.250 --> 26:35.219
I'VE LOST PLENTY OF THOSE
ALONG THE WAY.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.854
I JUST FEEL PISSED OFF.

26:37.890 --> 26:42.998
SOMEONE IS GONNA PAY DEARLY
FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE.

26:43.930 --> 26:47.934
YOU LINED US ALL UP
TO SEE HOW WE'D REACT
TO OLIVIA'S DEATH.

26:47.970 --> 26:48.834
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

26:48.870 --> 26:49.962
YOU STARED
STRAIGHT AT KRUGER

26:50.000 --> 26:52.036
LIKE YOU WERE TRYING
TO DEFLECT BLAME
ONTO SOMEONE ELSE.

26:52.070 --> 26:55.733
YOU ARE WASTING
PRECIOUS TIME,

26:55.780 --> 26:57.179
TIME SHE DOESN'T HAVE.

26:57.210 --> 27:01.340
NOW, UNLESS YOU HAVE
SOMETHING USEFUL TO ASK,
WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE LIVES.

27:01.380 --> 27:02.278
SO ARE WE.

27:05.850 --> 27:07.386
PATCH HER THROUGH.

27:07.420 --> 27:10.355
IT'S FOR YOU.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.159
GARCIA? TALK TO ME.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.896
THAT VIRUS THAT
KNOCKED OUT THE CCTV.

27:17.930 --> 27:18.862
WHAT ABOUT IT?

27:18.900 --> 27:21.960
IT WAS DOWNLOADED
INTO THE SYSTEM 3 WEEKS AGO.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.160
BY WHO?

27:23.200 --> 27:25.134
JUST BECAUSE
I LIED ABOUT OLIVIA
DOESN'T MAKE ME THE MOLE.

27:25.170 --> 27:29.004
NO, BUT THE VIRUS
THAT TOOK OUT
THE CCTV MONITORS DOES.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.200
IT ORIGINATED
FROM YOUR COMPUTER.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.970
THEN WHOEVER PUT IT
IN MY COMPUTER IS
TRYING TO FRAME ME.

27:33.010 --> 27:34.238
OLIVIA WAS LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING.

27:34.280 --> 27:36.271
SHE DIDN'T FIND A THING.
YOU KNOW WHY?

27:36.320 --> 27:38.345
BECAUSE ALL OF YOUR FILES
HAD BEEN ERASED.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.449
DO YOU REALLY THINK
IF I WAS THE MOLE,

27:40.490 --> 27:42.708
I WOULD KEEP FILES
THAT WOULD INCRIMINATE ME?

27:42.760 --> 27:44.921
THOSE FILES WERE ERASED
TO MAKE ME LOOK GUILTY.

27:44.960 --> 27:45.984
LOOKS LIKE IT'S WORKING.

27:46.030 --> 27:49.955
MORGAN, YOUR
GIRLFRIEND'S BACK.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.424
GARCIA, IT'S MORGAN. GO.

27:52.470 --> 27:56.793
THAT VIRUS LEI-T A BACK DOOR
INTO THE CIA MAINFRAME.

27:56.840 --> 27:57.864
YEAH, SO?

27:57.910 --> 27:59.138
I SORT OF WENT AHEAD
AND USED IT

27:59.170 --> 28:01.877
TO FIND OUT
WHO ORDERED JOHN SUMMERS'
PSYCH EVAL WITH GIDEON.

28:01.910 --> 28:02.535
WHO WAS IT?

28:02.580 --> 28:04.207
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT'S SO WEIRD.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.740
WHO, GARCIA

28:05.780 --> 28:06.747
JOHN SUMMERS.

28:06.780 --> 28:09.476
SUMMERS

28:09.520 --> 28:12.216
SO WE'D ASK
THAT QUESTION OURSELVES.

28:12.250 --> 28:13.888
WE MISSED SOMETHING
ON THAT TAPE.

28:13.920 --> 28:14.852
WE BETTER FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT WAS

28:14.890 --> 28:19.156
BEFORE HASSAN'S FRIEND
IN HERE BEATS US TO IT.

28:23.260 --> 28:26.798
I HAVE TO FIND
SOME WATER.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.229
OK?

28:30.500 --> 28:31.307
NO.

28:31.340 --> 28:34.207
IF MR. SUMMERS
COMES BACK BEFORE I DO,

28:34.240 --> 28:37.437
YOU TELL HIM
TO WAIT FOR ME.

28:38.910 --> 28:41.743
DO NOT COME LOOKING
FOR MOMMY.

28:41.780 --> 28:45.113
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
YOU'RE SAFE HERE.

28:45.150 --> 28:49.211
PROMISE ME.
DO NOT LEAVE HERE.

28:50.060 --> 28:52.085
YOU BOTH PROMISE?

29:10.110 --> 29:13.045
PRESIDENTS COME,
PRESIDENTS GO.

29:15.450 --> 29:19.238
THE PEOPLE THAT RUN
THOSE PRESIDENTS.

29:20.150 --> 29:22.357
PEOPLE LIKE YOU?

29:22.390 --> 29:24.085
ME?

29:24.130 --> 29:25.085
NO.

29:25.130 --> 29:27.951
NO. NO. I'M
AN EXPENDABLE PAWN.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.528
BUT I GOT WISE
TO THEIR GAME.

29:32.570 --> 29:35.459
GAME

29:36.240 --> 29:38.162
BATTLESHIP.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.838
I'M THE SHIP AT SEA.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.474
THEY TRY TO SINK ME.

29:43.510 --> 29:44.909
HOW DO YOU COPE?

29:44.950 --> 29:46.372
COM PARTM ENTALIZATION.

29:46.410 --> 29:50.016
SEPARATE AND SEAL
EVERY ASPECT OF MY LIFE.

29:50.050 --> 29:51.119
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

29:51.150 --> 29:53.311
IF ONE PART OF THE HULL
IS COMPROMISED,

29:53.350 --> 29:56.114
THE REST OF THE HULL
REMAINS INTACT.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.559
I STAY AFLOAT.

29:57.590 --> 29:58.784
AND WHAT ABOUT A DIRECT HIT?

29:58.830 --> 30:04.166
THEN I HAVE A BOX
THAT I PUT THE REALLY
IMPORTANT THINGS IN,

30:04.200 --> 30:07.294
A SORT OF INSURANCE POLICY.

30:07.330 --> 30:09.389
AGAINST WHAT?

30:09.440 --> 30:11.965
SUDDEN DEATH.

30:12.640 --> 30:17.179
KEEP IT SAFE FROM THOSE
WHO APPEAR TO BE FRIENDS.

30:17.210 --> 30:19.974
HE WAS TRYING
TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE MOLE.

30:20.010 --> 30:21.318
IF THEY WERE
FOLLOWING SUMMERS,

30:21.350 --> 30:24.217
HOW COME THEY DON'T KNOW
WHERE SUMMERS
PUT AALIYAH?

30:24.250 --> 30:28.459
YOU COULDN'T FOLLOW SUMMERS
THROUGH A DESERT.
HE WAS THAT GOOD.

30:28.490 --> 30:30.117
SOMEBODY FOLLOWED YOU.

30:30.160 --> 30:33.994
THEN SUMMERS
MUST HAVE KNOWN
THEY'D BE FILMING HIM.

30:34.030 --> 30:36.225
THEY ALWAYS ARE. SO SMILE.

30:36.260 --> 30:39.559
GARCIA, LET'S REVIEW
THE TAPE AGAIN.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.238
HE SURE LIKES BOATS.

30:41.270 --> 30:43.636
HE REFERS TO
COMPARTMENTALIZING HIS LIFE

30:43.670 --> 30:45.365
LIKE THE HULL OF A SHIP.

30:45.410 --> 30:46.604
YEAH. AND THEN
HE TALKS ABOUT A BOX.

30:46.640 --> 30:50.531
AND PUTTING SOMETHING
INSIDE THE BOX
AS AN INSURANCE POLICY.

30:50.580 --> 30:54.118
HE WAS TELLING GIDEON
HOW TO FIND AALIYAH.

30:54.150 --> 30:57.039
SUMMERS' COVER IN SAUDI
WAS FOR A SHIPPING COMPANY.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.184
OK. WHAT ABOUT
A SHIPPING CONTAINER?

30:59.220 --> 31:00.414
THAT'S A BOX.
THAT'S A BIG BOX.

31:00.450 --> 31:05.353
THE ONLY SHIPPING PORT
NEAR SUMMERS' APARTMENT
IN BALTIMORE,

31:05.390 --> 31:07.585
IT'S NORTH UP THE I-95
FROM LANGLEY.

31:07.630 --> 31:11.066
GARCIA, I LOVE YOU.

31:11.100 --> 31:11.862
GARCIA?

31:11.900 --> 31:15.131
SOMEONE JUST TAPPED
INTO THIS FEED.

31:18.610 --> 31:22.239
WE JUST FOUND OUT
WHERE AALIYAH IS.

31:23.440 --> 31:26.204
AND SO DID SOMEONE ELSE.

32:00.580 --> 32:03.242
I CAN HAVE
THE CHOPPER ON THE ROOF
FUELED AND READY IN 2 MINUTES.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.487
THERE ARE THOUSANDS
OF CONTAINERS AT THAT PORT.

32:05.520 --> 32:08.250
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
AALIYAH'S IN ONE
OF THOSE CONTAINERS?

32:08.290 --> 32:10.281
WHY DON'T WE SEND IN
A SWAT TEAM, SPLIT THEM UP,

32:10.320 --> 32:11.685
HAVE THEM SEARCH IN GRIDS.

32:11.730 --> 32:15.518
WHY? BECAUSE HASSAN
HAS DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY,
THIS MISSION CAN'T EXIST.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.596
IT'S NOT GINA.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.467
MORGAN,
TAKE GINA WITH YOU.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.731
WAIT. THIS IS MY COMMAND.
THESE ARE MY PEOPLE.

32:22.770 --> 32:24.306
WE HAVE JURISDICTION HERE,

32:24.340 --> 32:26.399
AND THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO TO STOP US.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.635
THIS IS MY CAREER
ON THE LINE HERE.

32:28.680 --> 32:32.275
YOU ALWAYS
TRUSTED ME, RIGHT?

32:32.550 --> 32:35.178
TRUST ME NOW.

32:35.220 --> 32:36.346
COME WITH US.

32:36.380 --> 32:39.543
THIS IS CRAZY. BRUNO.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.357
GO. GO, GO, GO.

32:44.390 --> 32:45.425
USE THE THERMAL IMAGING.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.121
SEARCH EVERY CONTAINER
FOR BODY HEAT.

32:47.160 --> 32:49.128
YOU CAN WALK US IN
AND DIRECT US
WHEN WE GET THERE.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.698
GREEN, ADAMS.
DUNCAN, COME WITH ME.

32:52.730 --> 32:55.597
JASON, YOU BETTER
BE CERTAIN ABOUT THIS.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.029
IAM.

32:58.070 --> 32:59.264
SO CONVINCE ME.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.574
WE SEE IT ALL THE TIME
IN SUSPECT S WHO KILL
THEIR LOVED ONES.

33:01.610 --> 33:04.773
THEY TRY TO IMMEDIATELY
SHIl-T THE FOCUS AWAY
FROM THEMSELVES.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.471
THERE'S OFTEN
AN EMOTIONAL DETACHMENT

33:06.510 --> 33:08.068
IN THE WAY THE STATEMENT
WAS CONSTRUCTED.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.542
KRUGER BETRAYED HIS WIFE,
BETRAYED OLIVIA.

33:09.580 --> 33:13.983
AFTER ALL THAT BETRAYAL,
HIS COUNTRY WAS EASY.

33:38.310 --> 33:40.574
EXCUSE ME A SECOND.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.754
GIDEON.

33:53.660 --> 33:56.094
YOU WERE RIGHT.

33:56.760 --> 33:59.126
RIGHT, BUT TOO LATE.

33:59.170 --> 34:01.058
HASSAN HAS
BEATEN US TO IT.

34:01.100 --> 34:04.433
DON'T HURT THEM. IT WAS ME.
IT WAS ALL MY FAULT.

34:04.470 --> 34:07.667
HURT THEM? I BURY THEM!

34:07.710 --> 34:09.507
I BURY YOU!

34:09.540 --> 34:11.144
LOOK AT THIS.

34:11.180 --> 34:13.307
YOU SEE?

34:13.350 --> 34:14.544
YOU BETRAYED ME

34:14.580 --> 34:17.743
AND TOOK MY CHILDREN
AWAY FROM ME. WHY?

34:17.780 --> 34:20.248
DO WHAT YOU WANT TO ME.

34:22.360 --> 34:26.683
GINA AND MORGAN
WILL ARRIVE IN 3 MINUTES.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.108
THEY'RE SOMEWHERE
ON THE EAST SIDE OF THIS PORT.

34:45.150 --> 34:49.519
YOU GUYS, TAKE
THAT AREA OVER THERE.
MORGAN, LET'S GO.

34:59.190 --> 35:02.227
DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS.

35:02.860 --> 35:04.464
WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?

35:04.500 --> 35:06.764
CAN'T YOU PEOPLE SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON?

35:06.800 --> 35:08.438
ALL OF THIS WAS PART
OF THEIR PLAN,

35:08.470 --> 35:11.405
AND NOW HASSAN IS GOING
TO KILL AALIYAH.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.806
THIS IS OUR
ONE AND ONLY OFFER.

35:13.840 --> 35:17.401
CONSIDER IT CAREFULLY
BEFORE YOU RESPOND.

35:17.440 --> 35:18.475
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

35:18.510 --> 35:21.149
IF THIS IS
SOME KIND OF A TRICK,
I'M NOT BUYING IT.

35:24.590 --> 35:27.514
I AM NOT THE MOLE.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.654
THIS IS CRAZY, GINA. WE'RE
JUST RUNNING IN CIRCLES.

35:37.700 --> 35:40.669
REID, COME ON. HELP US OUT.
GIVE ME SOMETHING.

35:40.700 --> 35:43.897
A HUNDRED METERS NORTH
OF YOUR CURRENT LOCATION.

35:43.940 --> 35:48.377
LET'S GO. LET'S GO BACK.
COME ON. LET'S GO BACK.

35:49.910 --> 35:54.415
WE CAN'T ARREST HIM.
THIS IS STILL A CIA MATTER.
YOU DO KNOW THAT.

35:54.450 --> 35:56.816
HOW WILL YOU EXPLAIN THIS
TO THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT?

35:56.850 --> 35:58.841
EXPLAIN WHAT?
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.949
LET'S JUST GET AALIYAH
AND HER CHILDREN BACK ALIVE.

36:00.990 --> 36:03.686
WE'LL WORRY ABOUT
HASSAN'S LIFE LATER.

36:09.730 --> 36:10.594
MORGAN.

36:10.630 --> 36:11.528
YEAH. I HEAR YOU.

36:11.570 --> 36:12.491
THEY'RE RIGHT
IN FRONT OF YOU.

36:12.530 --> 36:15.499
MAKE THE ARREST, MORGAN.
IT'S FBI JURISDICTION.

36:15.540 --> 36:17.235
YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

36:17.270 --> 36:21.229
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

36:22.810 --> 36:26.803
EASY. EASY. EASY.
EASY DOES IT.

36:34.760 --> 36:35.556
FBI.

36:35.590 --> 36:39.356
LET THE LADY GO
AND PUT THE GUN DOWN.

36:39.390 --> 36:42.928
I SAID PUT THE GUN DOWN.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.690
DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY, MY FRIEND.

36:50.740 --> 36:53.732
UH-UH. YOU GOT IT WRONG,
MY FRIEND.

36:53.770 --> 36:55.601
THIS CONTAINER HASN'T
PASSED THROUGH CUSTOMS.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.631
OFFICIALLY,
WE'RE NOT ON U.S. SOIL.

36:57.680 --> 37:00.843
SUMMERS WAS A SMART MAN.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.871
THAT HE WAS.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.445
DROP THE GUN.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.790
MORGAN?

37:18.900 --> 37:20.390
MORGAN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:20.430 --> 37:22.967
STILL CERTAIN
GINA ISN'T THE MOLE?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.467
MORGAN.

37:28.310 --> 37:29.971
MORGAN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:30.010 --> 37:33.946
GIDEON, WE GOT
A SITUATION HERE.

37:34.420 --> 37:37.912
GINA, DON'T DO THIS.
GINA, DON'T DO THIS.

37:37.950 --> 37:41.750
I DON'T TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU.
BRUNO, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

37:41.790 --> 37:43.781
COVER THEIR EYES.
COVER THEIR EYES.

37:43.820 --> 37:46.027
PLEASE. PLEASE STOP THIS.

37:47.030 --> 37:48.292
BRUNO.

37:48.330 --> 37:49.558
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.658
SAY IT.

37:50.700 --> 37:51.769
IT'S NOT YOUR CALL.

37:51.800 --> 37:54.769
I TOLD YOU FROM THE START
THIS WAS STRICTLY IN-HOUSE.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.290
THIS IS NOT YOUR CALL.

37:56.340 --> 37:58.501
GINA, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

37:58.540 --> 38:00.030
AN ORDER.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.401
FINISH HIM.

38:05.450 --> 38:06.701
FINISH HIM.

38:06.750 --> 38:07.671
GINA, DON'T DO THIS.

38:07.710 --> 38:10.713
YOU'RE GONNA CUT
THE VISUAL FEED. RIGHT, BRUNO?

38:10.750 --> 38:13.947
OF COURSE.
CUT IT NOW. CUT IT.

38:40.150 --> 38:43.039
I WAN NA THANK YOU, JASON,
FOR YOUR HELP.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.514
WHY?

38:45.550 --> 38:48.348
WHY DID YOU TURN AGAINST
EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE IN?

38:48.390 --> 38:50.085
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

38:50.120 --> 38:51.109
WHEN SOMEONE ASKS YOU

38:51.160 --> 38:54.550
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT LOSING
ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES,

38:54.600 --> 38:57.649
THE ONLY HUMAN ANSWER
IS "I FEEL GUILTY,"
ISN'T IT?

38:57.700 --> 39:01.090
BUT AS YOU
SO BRILLIANTLY DEDUCED,

39:01.130 --> 39:04.668
KRUGER SPENCE
IS THE GUILTY ONE.

39:15.820 --> 39:18.482
RIDICULOUS.

39:18.790 --> 39:19.643
ABSURD.

39:19.690 --> 39:23.456
ONLY THING THAT'S ABSURD
IS YOUR ARROGANCE.

39:23.490 --> 39:27.688
TO BELIEVE YOU COULD
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

39:27.730 --> 39:29.425
UN FORTU NATELY,

39:29.460 --> 39:32.065
WITH HASSAN NOW DEAD,

39:32.100 --> 39:33.260
YOU HAVE NO PROOF.

39:33.300 --> 39:37.168
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I HAD TO FIND OUT
IF I WAS RIGHT.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.862
HOW DID YOU KNOW
IT WAS BRUNO?

39:39.910 --> 39:42.470
BECAUSE AGENT GIDEON
BELIEVED IN ME.

39:42.510 --> 39:44.171
AND THERE ISN'T
A REASON IN THE WORLD

39:44.210 --> 39:47.577
TO KILL A MAN WHO KNOWS
AS MUCH AS HASSAN DOES.

39:47.610 --> 39:48.679
EXCEPT ONE.

39:48.720 --> 39:53.043
THE SAME ONE
THAT MADE BRUNO
AND HASSAN KILL SUMMERS.

39:53.090 --> 39:54.489
SELF-PRESERVATION.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.853
LOOKS LIKE GIDEON WAS RIGHT.

39:57.890 --> 40:00.529
YES, IT DOES.

40:03.660 --> 40:07.061
ACTUALLY, HASSAN
IS ALIVE AND WELL.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.124
HE'S EN ROUTE.

40:08.170 --> 40:12.106
THAT'S ALL THE PROOF
WE'LL NEED.

40:16.980 --> 40:18.231
YOU ARE A FOOL

40:18.280 --> 40:22.046
IF YOU THINK THEY'RE
GONNA PUT ME IN PRISON
WITH ALL THAT I KNOW.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.617
WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO KILL OLIVIA?

40:24.650 --> 40:26.049
ECONOMICS.

40:26.090 --> 40:29.457
OLIVIA WAS LOOKING
INTO YOUR FINANCIAL RECORDS
WHEN YOU SNAPPED HER NECK.

40:29.490 --> 40:32.789
SO SHE KNEW
YOUR DIRTY LITTLE SECRET.

40:32.830 --> 40:34.127
WHICH ONE?

40:34.160 --> 40:35.024
I HAVE SO MANY.

40:35.060 --> 40:39.019
YOU WERE LOOKING
TO CASH OUT USING HASSAN.

40:39.070 --> 40:40.628
MM-HMM.

40:40.670 --> 40:45.061
$20 MILLION FROM HASSAN
WILL GO A VERY LONG WAY

40:45.110 --> 40:48.568
TO HELPING OCCUPY MY MIND
ON A BEACH SOMEWHERE.

40:48.610 --> 40:50.805
ONLY BEACH YOU'LL SEE
IS ON A POSTCARD

40:50.840 --> 40:52.501
I SEND YOU
FROM MY VACATION.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.768
LET ME HAVE YOUR GUN.

40:59.250 --> 41:03.482
I THINK THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT
YOU'RE DOING TO ME, MY FRIEND,

41:03.520 --> 41:07.820
ARE GONNA BE A LOT HARDER
TO LIVE WITH THAN YOU THINK.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.259
WE'LL SEE YOU GUYS
LATER, ALL RIGHT?

41:19.310 --> 41:22.973
WE SHOULD THIS AGAIN
SOMETIME, OK?

41:28.550 --> 41:29.471
JERKS.

41:29.520 --> 41:33.217
COME ON. COME ON. QUICK.
I KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.114
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

41:34.150 --> 41:36.516
LOOKING FOR PRINCE WILLIAM'S
PHONE NUMBER.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.528
THE CIA IS BOUND TO HAVE IT.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.027
OH, GARCIA, COME ON.

41:40.060 --> 41:42.221
YEP. HERE IT IS.

41:42.260 --> 41:44.194
NO WAY.
YES WAY.

41:44.230 --> 41:45.527
GIVE ME A PEN.

41:45.570 --> 41:46.298
GARCIA, NO.

41:46.330 --> 41:47.069
I NEED THIS PEN.

41:47.100 --> 41:50.228
I NEED A PEN.
OH! IT DOESN'T WORK.

41:50.270 --> 41:51.999
GARCIA.

41:53.270 --> 41:55.170
OK.

41:57.780 --> 42:00.749
OH. THAT'S TOO BAD.

42:04.250 --> 42:08.789
SLEEP WELL, SWEET PRINCE.

42:09.120 --> 42:12.157
GOOD NIGHT, CRAZY PERSON.

42:12.190 --> 42:14.283
GOOD NIGHT.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.269
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IS WHY HE INVITED US HERE.

42:20.300 --> 42:23.667
HE DIDN'T. SUMMERS DID
BY ASKING FOR THE EVAL.

42:23.700 --> 42:26.032
WHEN I PUT THE CALL IN,
BRUNO HAD NO CHOICE.

42:26.070 --> 42:29.073
HE HAD TO FIND OUT
WHAT I KNEW AND KEEP ME CLOSE.

42:29.110 --> 42:30.134
BAD CHOICE.

42:30.180 --> 42:33.206
YOU SAID YOU'D SEND A POSTCARD
OF A BEACH. YOU LIED.

42:33.250 --> 42:34.808
YEAH. YOU HATE THE BEACH.

42:34.850 --> 42:36.647
BEACHES ARE FOR STORMING.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.318
ONLY IF ORDERED TO.

42:38.350 --> 42:39.317
THANK YOU.

42:39.350 --> 42:41.215
THANK YOU.

42:43.220 --> 42:45.757
I COULD ALWAYS
RENT A DECK CHAIR

42:45.790 --> 42:47.849
AND RECONSIDER MY CAREER.

42:47.890 --> 42:50.825
YOU ALWAYS KNOW
WHERE TO FIND US.

42:50.860 --> 42:53.727
I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.

42:59.010 --> 43:00.363
GEORGE ORWELL SAID,

43:00.410 --> 43:02.605
"IN A TIME
OF UNIVERSAL DECEIT,

43:02.640 --> 43:07.145
TELLING THE TRUTH
IS A REVOLUTIONARY ACT."
