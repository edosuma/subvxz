I was real jealous

a friend that--

36:15.820 --> 36:17.520
- I didn't want to talk
to my friends.

36:17.530 --> 36:19.090
They're judgmental.

36:19.090 --> 36:20.690
And then I didn't want to tell
my family

36:20.700 --> 36:23.860
because I already know that...

36:23.870 --> 36:26.200
they would've just
talked about me.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.430
- If you told your mom

36:28.440 --> 36:30.200
that you had feelings
for a girl,

36:30.210 --> 36:33.640
what would she say?

36:35.840 --> 36:38.380
- I don't know.
My mother's very religious.

36:38.380 --> 36:40.880
She--I don't know
what she would say.

36:40.880 --> 36:44.120
I don't know
what she would say, like--

36:44.120 --> 36:47.720
- You're both doing
something difficult,

36:47.720 --> 36:51.320
admitting something that
you haven't told lots of people

36:51.330 --> 36:52.960
and having a conversation

36:52.960 --> 36:54.760
about something
for the first time.

36:54.760 --> 36:55.960
- I mean, there's more stuff
that I haven't told

36:55.960 --> 36:57.860
a lot of people
because I don't--

36:57.870 --> 37:00.270
you know, I don't like telling
people what I go through.

37:00.270 --> 37:02.440
I like to just
keep it to myself.

37:02.440 --> 37:04.270
- Like what?
- It's complicated

37:04.270 --> 37:06.770
because we live in,
like, a shelter.

37:06.770 --> 37:08.140
All of us in, like,
a one-bedroom.

37:08.140 --> 37:10.240
- You and your--
- My mother and my sister

37:10.250 --> 37:11.610
and my brother.

37:11.610 --> 37:14.110
It's been a whole year.

37:14.120 --> 37:15.720
It was last year in June.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.350
Like, this guy just knocked
on our door

37:17.350 --> 37:18.750
and was like,
we have to leave.

37:18.750 --> 37:20.890
He's evicting us.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.760
The guy that sold
my mother our house,

37:22.760 --> 37:24.490
it was, like, a scam.

37:24.490 --> 37:26.130
Every day my mother,
she, like, she gets up,

37:26.130 --> 37:27.360
and she's, like, depressed.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.260
I'm depressed too a lot.

37:29.260 --> 37:32.430
That's basically why I wanted
to come here to meet you guys,

37:32.430 --> 37:35.130
'cause--couldn't go
to where I live.

37:35.140 --> 37:37.040
- That's some heavy shit.

37:37.040 --> 37:38.670
- Yeah, it is.

37:38.670 --> 37:42.710
- Why didn't you tell
any of that to Telizza?

37:42.710 --> 37:45.310
I mean, she was opening up
to you, and she was--

37:45.310 --> 37:48.610
you were being so wonderful
at listening to her.

37:48.620 --> 37:50.520
- Nobody even knows
any of this.

37:50.520 --> 37:51.980
I couldn't really go
to my friends.

37:51.990 --> 37:54.520
I want them to think
that I have a perfect life.

37:54.520 --> 37:57.560
- That mean they not
your friends if you can't--

37:57.560 --> 38:00.830
I feel bad because
you was helping me.

38:00.830 --> 38:02.660
I probably could've
helped you.

38:02.660 --> 38:03.900
- Yeah, but you live
in Chicago.

38:03.900 --> 38:05.800
I'm all the way
in Brooklyn.

38:05.800 --> 38:08.030
- Well, but even if she couldn't
have helped you with a bed,

38:08.040 --> 38:10.540
she could've just helped you
as a friend.

38:10.540 --> 38:11.570
- Yeah, but then
I would've said,

38:11.570 --> 38:13.010
"Okay, I live in Brooklyn,"

38:13.010 --> 38:14.370
and then you would've known
automatically

38:14.380 --> 38:18.210
that I wasn't
the person, so.

38:18.210 --> 38:21.710
- I don't think that
would've mattered, though,

38:21.720 --> 38:24.550
because don't nobody deserve
to go through that.

38:26.020 --> 38:28.790
- If you don't have a friend
or a person to talk to,

38:28.790 --> 38:30.620
you're gonna feel trapped,

38:30.630 --> 38:33.830
and it's gonna
make you unhappy.

38:36.160 --> 38:39.300

38:39.300 --> 38:43.000
I don't leave my friends
on scene.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.840
- Where do you think
you want to go from here?

38:46.840 --> 38:48.840
- I think we should
talk more,

38:48.840 --> 38:53.080
and we just have a friendship
and build upon that.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.780

you ain't Shai no more.
