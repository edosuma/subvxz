00:01.134 --> 00:02.503
-Hi, baby.
-How are you doing?

00:02.569 --> 00:04.905
-Good. How are you?
-Good to see you.

00:04.971 --> 00:07.875
-Look how fixed up you are today.
-What do you mean "today"?

00:07.941 --> 00:10.410
You don't even get this fixed up
for your own show.

00:10.477 --> 00:12.746
F*** you.

00:28.896 --> 00:32.799
Yes.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.205
Yup.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.506
Greens.

00:39.573 --> 00:42.543
Right. Queens.

00:52.519 --> 00:55.122
Yeah.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.362
You understand
the concept of karaoke, right?

01:02.429 --> 01:06.166
I have to warm up... with the lyrics.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.435
You warm up
by making a sound of some sort.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.939
I'm trying to get the lyrics down.
I don't wanna get them wrong.

01:12.539 --> 01:14.708
You're singing beautifully. Keep going.

01:14.775 --> 01:18.779
But you say you're warming up, you haven't
even done anything to warm up your voice.

01:18.846 --> 01:21.548
-You're being silent.
-But we have to play a song I know.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.985
-I can't f****** sing, do you know that?
-Yes.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.422
Just keep singing. Sing to your own song.

01:28.488 --> 01:29.756
-Have you--
-Okay.

01:29.823 --> 01:32.693
Tree.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.436
Shine.

01:45.305 --> 01:46.473
-Wrong.
-That's Trace Adkins singing.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.509
Can't be wrong.
Trace Adkins tried to f*** me.

01:48.575 --> 01:50.177
-He did? What happened?
-Yeah.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.912
He's too big.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.584
I can't imagine
what kind of heat he's packing.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.819
Like, oh, really?

01:58.886 --> 02:00.954
-What? I mean, he's physically so big.
-Yeah.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.456
Like, that's coming with something.

02:02.523 --> 02:07.060
So even if Trace has a small penis,
his body is still huge compared to his...

02:07.060 --> 02:11.365
Think about it, if you're that big and
you do have a small penis, you're f*****.

02:11.431 --> 02:12.833
-That's so embarrassing.
-Yeah.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.569
-To be tall, you know what it's like.
-Yup.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.070
Wait a minute.

02:24.111 --> 02:27.614
Do you feel like your life could be
written into a great country song?

02:27.681 --> 02:30.083
-Yeah, totally.
-What do you mean?

02:30.083 --> 02:34.288
You know, I'm just like a hot mess,
drinking, partying.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.490
In order for this to be in a country song,

02:36.557 --> 02:40.093
there's gonna have to be
some sort of a love interest or...

02:40.127 --> 02:42.529
No one's interested in me.
I don't have a love interest.

02:42.596 --> 02:46.099
-So let's make one up.
-Of course somebody's interested in you.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.169
I don't know.
You know, it's just there's everyone...

02:49.236 --> 02:51.405
I have to wait for somebody
to get divorced.

02:51.471 --> 02:52.873
That's a country song.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.641
-Okay. Great, great.
-Now we're getting there.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.144
What about, I don't like kids,
what about that?

02:57.211 --> 02:59.379
That might be a problem for a country song

02:59.446 --> 03:01.515
because everybody likes kids,
everybody likes kids, right?

03:01.582 --> 03:02.583
-No. No.
-Yeah.

03:02.649 --> 03:05.652
I could be the one country girl
that doesn't have them.

03:05.719 --> 03:11.458
So basically it's about a lonely,
miserable white Jewish girl

03:12.459 --> 03:15.896
who's gonna have to wait
for somebody to get divorced.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.965
-Yeah.
-You like where it's going like that?

03:18.065 --> 03:21.068
-That's good.
-You wanna sing something?

03:21.635 --> 03:22.736
We can try.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.442
Oh, yeah, this is a good one,
"Take On Me".

03:32.779 --> 03:35.649
Right? You should give me vocal lessons
while we're here.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.584
I know you do
The Voice and that b*******.

03:38.452 --> 03:42.956
But if I do something in a lower register
like this, isn't it better to like, eh...

03:43.090 --> 03:48.562
-You mean this, like your speaking voice?
-Yeah, like: ♪ Take on me ♪

03:48.629 --> 03:51.999
But you got to be in key. Here we go.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.274
-Are you doing that on purpose?
-No. What did I do?

04:00.340 --> 04:01.542
You sound like Darth Vader.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.681
-Should we try another song?
-Mm-hmm.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.260
-Ryan?
-Right on. Is that the word?

04:20.327 --> 04:22.829
"Turn around right on",
is that what you just said?

04:22.896 --> 04:25.499
Turn around right on?

04:25.566 --> 04:27.467
-Isn't that what she said?
-No.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.603
What did she say?

04:38.512 --> 04:40.080
-Bright eyes?
-Bright eyes.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.481
Oh, right.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.817
"Turn around, right on..."

04:43.884 --> 04:46.887
completely changes the meaning
of the song.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.622
People do that all the time.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.996
-Testy?

04:59.333 --> 05:01.568
-I said thirsty.
-Oh, thirsty?

05:01.635 --> 05:03.837
-It's thirsty.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.906
Why doesn't anyone use the word "thirsty"?

05:06.039 --> 05:08.342
I kind of like "right on" now.

05:10.210 --> 05:13.580
But why don't they put "thirsty",
the word "thirsty", in more songs?

05:13.647 --> 05:16.083
-That's a good question.
-You should put that...

05:16.149 --> 05:18.151
That's a perfect word for a country song.

05:18.218 --> 05:20.120
Put that into one of your songs,
"thirsty".

05:20.187 --> 05:22.456
-Okay.
-I'm thirsty, I'm going over to her house.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.092
I'm gonna key her car
because I'm so f****** thirsty.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.227
Gonna key her car? Is that what you said?

05:27.294 --> 05:29.062
-I mean, key your car, yeah.
-Yeah.

05:29.096 --> 05:32.466
That's what people do in Oklahoma, right?
I've done that.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.301
-Have you really?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:34.368 --> 05:37.905
-No, my friend did it for me, actually.
-Somebody that you were upset with?

05:37.971 --> 05:39.139
-A boyfriend.
-Oh, yeah?

05:39.206 --> 05:42.509
Yeah. He cheated on me.
And she went over and keyed his car.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.877
She's a good friend.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.886
If a guy cheated on you, I actually...

05:55.255 --> 05:58.759
You seem like the kind of girl
that would full on, like...

06:00.727 --> 06:02.429
-Revenge like that. Like, key.
-No. I'm--

06:03.897 --> 06:05.132
F*** you.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.839
Yeah, I mean, I f****** went off on him
because I walked in on him

06:11.905 --> 06:14.308
and he was having sex
with some Asian woman,

06:14.374 --> 06:16.043
and we had broken up that morning.

06:16.076 --> 06:19.313
-You walked in on the...?
-Yes, it was awful.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.747
-Wow.
-Yeah.

06:20.814 --> 06:24.685
And I walked in and there was like...
Let me just finish the song, hold on.

06:24.751 --> 06:25.953
Okay.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.859
There's still four minutes
of this song left.

06:34.061 --> 06:38.065
This song is eight minutes long.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.602
-Look at this. Look.
-I'm gonna pee.

06:43.604 --> 06:47.708
Oh, my God, I'm gonna pee.
I'm laughing too hard. Oh, my God.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.279
I rarely see guys that I'm interested in.

06:52.346 --> 06:53.714
-Really?
-Not in L.A.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.083
-Why not L.A.?
-Everybody's gay.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.119
-Right.
-And everybody's so, you know, weird here.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.688
-They do things like acupuncture?
-Yeah.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.924
-Stupid.
-My dogs get acupuncture, actually.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.592
-Really?
-Talk about L.A.

07:05.659 --> 07:06.660
Talk about stupid.

07:06.727 --> 07:10.030
-L.A. people, y'all get into so much...
-Everybody is so stupid here.

07:10.030 --> 07:14.568
They go to cryochambers and they freeze
themselves and they're just like, um...

07:14.635 --> 07:17.504
-Wait a minute, what is it called?
-It's called cryochamber.

07:17.571 --> 07:20.674
I almost bought one of those machines,
it was, like, $250,000,

07:20.741 --> 07:23.043
because I thought it would
help me lose five pounds.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.846
-Does it hurt?
-It's like 150 degrees below zero

07:25.913 --> 07:29.650
while it blows f****** cold air
on your genitals.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.289
-Where are we going?
-We're going to the f****** cryochamber.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.226
I'm not doing this.
I think this is stupid.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.862
-Oh, my God, what a p****.
-Yeah.

07:43.864 --> 07:47.201
-Please tell me you have an appointment.
-Hi. We're doing it.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.670
Who is "we"?
I don't even wanna be here right now.

07:51.205 --> 07:53.273
-Come on over this way.
-Where are you taking me?

07:53.340 --> 07:57.077
-In case you change your mind.
-You guys both realize this is a scam?

07:57.878 --> 07:59.880
I'll do it, because he's scared.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.618
Oh, my God.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.855
-How many minutes am I doing?
-Three minutes.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.289
Oh, boy. Here she goes.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.726
Is this supposed to do
anything for your personality?

08:12.793 --> 08:16.630
Hope you don't get that grey streak in
there like the little girl did in Frozen.

08:17.331 --> 08:20.167
You're really on
a f****** roll now, aren't you?

08:21.401 --> 08:23.804
-Oh, my God!
-Why are you doing this?

08:25.806 --> 08:29.076
-How cold is it now?
-Minus 130.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.545
Hey, Chelsea,
do you have goose bumps?

08:31.612 --> 08:33.547
Yeah, I've got
two big goose bumps.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.182
[chuckles]

08:35.249 --> 08:38.085
-Thirty seconds left.
-So good. I need a drink, I need a drink!

08:38.150 --> 08:40.453
Hey, see how high of a note you can hit.

08:48.896 --> 08:51.331
-Oh, boy. I'll meet you at the bar.
-Whoo!

09:00.073 --> 09:03.010
Before we get to the bar,
can we rock out to one of my songs?

09:03.076 --> 09:05.512
-Yeah, yeah, definitely.
-How about "Austin"?

09:05.579 --> 09:09.550
-Oh, yeah, yeah, I like that song.
-You do? What is it you like about it?

09:09.616 --> 09:13.353
I love Austin the city, so all songs...
Have you ever lived in Austin?

09:13.420 --> 09:14.421
Hmm-mm.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.558
That makes two of us,
but I do love the city

09:17.624 --> 09:20.561
-and I like the way you talk about it.
-In the song?

09:20.627 --> 09:22.629
-Yeah.
-When I'm singing about Austin in it?

09:22.696 --> 09:24.898
Yeah, a lot of people
have written songs about Austin

09:25.032 --> 09:26.934
and no one has quite
said it like you have.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.776
-Oh, is it about a girl?
-Yeah.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.578
-Named Austin?
-Yeah.

10:05.172 --> 10:08.475
-"Wait for the times"? You said...
-Keep going, keep going, please.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.290
Oh, don't stop,
I was just getting into it.

10:23.357 --> 10:27.094
I've never wanted a drink
so badly in my life.

10:31.532 --> 10:33.500
That's not a door.

10:33.567 --> 10:34.801
Oh, it is a door!

10:35.769 --> 10:38.105
What a cute little place this is.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.409
-I just really love to drink.
-Hello.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.478
I think he wants to try an Aperol Spritz.

10:44.545 --> 10:46.780
Can I have a vodka and tonic?

10:46.847 --> 10:49.783
I'll take a vodka soda.
Oh, no, I'm double-fisted.

10:50.951 --> 10:54.221
I feel a f****** breeze on my a******.
What the f*** is that?

10:54.288 --> 10:57.591
-Hey, can I have a Bloody Mary?
-I'll take a Long Island Iced Tea.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.426
I think
I'm really buzzed already.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.562
Go make a Mai Tai,
you know how to do that.

11:01.628 --> 11:05.065
-♪ Tiny bubble ♪
-You're so ridiculous.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.201
This is still Carball Karaoke.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.803
-What?
-Carpool Karaoke.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.273
Cheers.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.410
To good times
in Los Angeles, California.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.516
This is your jam. Sing to this.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.191
Can I have a little more vodka
in there too, please?

11:33.393 --> 11:36.463
-I know that part

11:58.652 --> 12:01.855
-Love, give it a shot!

12:01.922 --> 12:04.191
No, I'm just singing.
But, yeah, give me a shot.

12:04.258 --> 12:06.059
Oh, you're about to do a shot?

12:15.502 --> 12:17.905
Why the fake microphone? Just sing.

12:17.971 --> 12:18.972
You're a f****** singer.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.441
-Why do you have to pretend?
-It's an air microphone.

12:21.508 --> 12:24.845
-But why? You're not on stage.
-Why the f*** not?

12:25.712 --> 12:27.581
-Because you just sing.
-Like right now?

12:28.715 --> 12:30.350
-No, air guitar is gonna...
-Air guitar.

12:33.987 --> 12:37.491
Oh, my God,
what an idiot you are.

12:37.558 --> 12:38.559
Yeah.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.328
Will you call me a taxi?
I don't wanna ride with him.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.502
Yes. Get in, there you go.

12:48.569 --> 12:51.205
-Oh, you're not going?
-No, no, I have an appointment.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.674
-You have an appointment?
-It's nice to see you.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.342
-Okay, well, you have an appointment?
-Bye.

12:55.409 --> 12:56.777
It's like six o'clock.

12:56.844 --> 12:59.112
I have a bunch of appointments
at six always.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.648
-Bye, thank you.
-If you wanna get--

13:02.249 --> 13:05.052
Thank you. Whoa, whoa.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.895
Oh my God. What a stupid afternoon.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.198
Excuse me.
