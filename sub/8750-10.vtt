WEBVTT

00:05.145 --> 00:07.468
It's an old home with a lot of history.

00:07.469 --> 00:10.837
I just see a lot of dead
bodies all over the place.

00:10.838 --> 00:13.424
It was like terror just
kind of took over my body.

00:13.425 --> 00:14.895
Whoa. (Bleep)

00:14.896 --> 00:18.366
I got, like, pushed out, and it scared me.

00:18.367 --> 00:21.625
I was pretty skeptical, but not
now, not after that experience.

00:21.626 --> 00:24.797
I'm scared to death of
what may happen next.

00:24.798 --> 00:29.433
She's a bad girl.
Like, she likes to scare people.

00:29.434 --> 00:30.833
Men lost their lives.

00:30.834 --> 00:32.878
Some of them were literally incinerated.

00:32.879 --> 00:34.503
Oh, it was a terrible way to go.

00:34.504 --> 00:37.564
His head was cracked.

00:39.436 --> 00:41.322
There's something down there.

00:41.323 --> 00:44.563
My name.. Is Amy Allan.

00:45.424 --> 00:47.627
A lot of dead people are here.

00:47.628 --> 00:48.849
I see dead people.

00:48.850 --> 00:50.505
This is not good.

00:50.506 --> 00:54.283
I speak to dead people..
He is very pissed off.

00:54.284 --> 00:55.713
And they speak to me.

00:55.714 --> 00:57.143
The house is angry.

00:57.144 --> 01:00.631
But there's only way to know
if my findings are real.

01:00.632 --> 01:02.382
He's killed people.

01:02.383 --> 01:03.798
I rely on my partner.

01:03.799 --> 01:05.113
I'm Steve Dischiavi.

01:05.114 --> 01:07.236
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

01:07.237 --> 01:08.755
He got shot at his house?

01:08.756 --> 01:11.741
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:11.742 --> 01:13.168
Aren't you terrified, being here?

01:13.169 --> 01:14.417
It's my job to reveal 'em.

01:14.418 --> 01:16.611
That sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist."

01:16.612 --> 01:18.715
But Steve and I never speak..

01:18.716 --> 01:20.638
We never communicate
during an investigation..

01:20.639 --> 01:23.312
Until the very end.. It's bad.

01:23.313 --> 01:25.447
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay..

01:25.448 --> 01:26.782
I'd like some answers.

01:26.783 --> 01:29.783
Or time to get out.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.161 --> 01:58.633
Amy and I never cross paths
during our investigations.

01:58.634 --> 02:02.885
I dig into the property's history,
uncovering secrets from its past.

02:02.886 --> 02:06.425
After we're done, we meet with our
clients and give them answers.

02:06.426 --> 02:11.886
But we never know if we'll
deliver good news or bad.

02:20.385 --> 02:24.885
Population.. 856, and that's including me.

02:27.326 --> 02:30.714
A woman named Debbie called us in because
of some disturbing things happening

02:30.715 --> 02:33.912
at the Mackay Mansion, where she works.

02:33.913 --> 02:36.210
This mansion's been turned into a museum,

02:36.211 --> 02:39.714
and several visitors have run out
of there completely terrified.

02:39.715 --> 02:42.939
Debbie thinks she may be
crazy for sticking around.

02:42.940 --> 02:48.840
She's pretty shaken up, and she's
hoping we can find her some answers.

02:57.675 --> 02:59.356
Before Amy enters a location,

02:59.357 --> 03:03.538
I clear it of anything that
could be leading information.

03:03.539 --> 03:06.815
This museum has a lot of photographs.

03:06.816 --> 03:10.160
So it's important that I remove them all..

03:10.161 --> 03:14.601
To avoid influencing Amy during her walk.

03:28.054 --> 03:30.754
There's a fire.

03:31.153 --> 03:33.913
Somebody help me.

03:46.576 --> 03:48.496
Okay.

03:48.623 --> 03:51.651
There's a lot of dead people here.

03:51.652 --> 03:57.052
So I'd say that this town
is pretty freaking active.

03:57.457 --> 04:00.995
As soon as I arrived, dozens
of dead people surrounded me,

04:00.996 --> 04:04.467
all wanting to share their stories.

04:04.468 --> 04:09.868
I just see a lot of dead
bodies all over the place.

04:12.166 --> 04:14.926
It's really bad.

04:28.852 --> 04:32.543
So, Debbie, what's going on here
that you needed to call us in?

04:32.544 --> 04:37.176
Well, I'm a tour guide, and we seem
to be having some unusual activity

04:37.177 --> 04:38.289
happening here.

04:38.290 --> 04:41.280
And it's getting more and more frequent.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.517
We're hearing things, we're
seeing things, object are moving,

04:44.518 --> 04:47.818
and it really scares me.

04:51.114 --> 04:53.412
What exactly is the Mackay Mansion?

04:53.413 --> 04:59.313
Well, the Mackay Mansion was where
John Mackay had his mining office.

04:59.475 --> 05:04.647
He made quite a bit of money
up here during his day.

05:04.648 --> 05:07.583
And this was where all his
businesses took place.

05:07.584 --> 05:10.177
- And now it's a museum.
- Yes.

05:10.178 --> 05:11.804
Why are you staying?

05:11.805 --> 05:13.436
I love this too much.

05:13.437 --> 05:16.503
And how often in life do you
find a job that you love to do?

05:16.504 --> 05:18.232
Are you concerned for your safety?

05:18.233 --> 05:22.873
Yeah, because I don't know who or
what it may be, what it wants, and..

05:22.874 --> 05:25.164
And it just makes you feel like it..

05:25.165 --> 05:29.245
What it wants isn't gonna be good.

05:33.019 --> 05:35.599
Wait a minute.

05:39.520 --> 05:42.435
There's a little girl..

05:42.436 --> 05:45.856
Who runs around the place.

05:47.879 --> 05:53.613
She's got long brown hair, it's
curled and put up with a bow,

05:53.614 --> 05:57.334
brown eyes, chubby little face.

05:57.931 --> 06:03.271
I want to say like 7, but,
uh, she's got problems.

06:11.190 --> 06:13.864
So, Debbie, what's going on in here?

06:13.865 --> 06:19.765
Well, a lot of people have reported seeing
the spirit of a little girl up here.

06:20.807 --> 06:22.326
So one night, some friends and I

06:22.327 --> 06:25.144
decided to come in here and
make contact with her,

06:25.145 --> 06:28.065
let her know that we know she's here.

06:28.066 --> 06:29.804
I just kind of said, "you
know, if you're here,"

06:29.805 --> 06:32.202
"can you give us some kind of sign?"

06:32.203 --> 06:36.627
And this toy box right here, the lid,
all of a sudden comes falling down.

06:36.628 --> 06:40.334
This blanket that's right
here starts going up and over

06:40.335 --> 06:42.469
this guy's shoulder, all on its own.

06:42.470 --> 06:45.940
He's sitting right in front of the toy box.

06:45.941 --> 06:46.975
I mean, this is heavy.

06:46.976 --> 06:48.054
It is.

06:48.055 --> 06:49.172
And this got pulled up?

06:49.173 --> 06:52.893
The blanket started coming out.

06:54.273 --> 06:56.471
I don't know. I think I would've been
outta here in a New York minute.

06:56.472 --> 07:00.363
I don't think I would've stuck around.

07:00.364 --> 07:03.211
The little girl's running around, laughing.

07:03.212 --> 07:04.752
"Ha ha."

07:04.753 --> 07:06.588
"Hee hee hee hee hee."

07:06.589 --> 07:09.387
She likes to jump on things.

07:09.388 --> 07:12.401
She likes to hide in things.

07:12.402 --> 07:15.582
She's a little rascal.

07:17.259 --> 07:21.279
People would get nervous from this.

07:24.801 --> 07:27.687
So do people experience her doing things?

07:27.688 --> 07:30.867
I would think that they would.

07:30.868 --> 07:36.084
If you're in bed, you might feel
her, like, crawl on the bed.

07:36.085 --> 07:38.702
She's in the wardrobe,
and you hear little..

07:38.703 --> 07:42.663
Tick.. Tick.. Tick..
Tick.. Tick..

07:43.769 --> 07:46.109
She's bad.

07:54.291 --> 07:56.845
So, Debbie, what have you
experienced down here?

07:56.846 --> 07:58.612
I was on a tour, and all of a sudden,

07:58.613 --> 08:02.474
this shadowy figure just
appeared by the gazebo.

08:02.475 --> 08:03.373
And..

08:03.374 --> 08:06.328
It had, like, these glowing eyes.

08:06.329 --> 08:10.573
It was like terror just kind of took
over my body, and I.. I couldn't move.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.209
Now have you seen him close?

08:12.210 --> 08:14.046
Yes.

08:14.047 --> 08:19.947
Every time it's been seen now, it's
coming closer and closer to the house.

08:28.124 --> 08:30.557
Oh, there's a big old guy..

08:30.558 --> 08:33.498
A pretty tall dude.

08:35.563 --> 08:41.443
Uh, you know, he likes to kinda
freak people out, you know?

08:41.457 --> 08:44.871
I'm seeing a large dead man
moving within the shadows.

08:44.872 --> 08:48.513
It feels like he's stalking me,
like he's waiting to attack,

08:48.514 --> 08:54.214
and I know I'm not the first
person he's done this to.

08:55.747 --> 08:57.951
Big guy is not so nice.

08:57.952 --> 08:59.360
Like, evil.

08:59.361 --> 09:02.907
Probably just looks like a
big, dark, scary thing.

09:02.908 --> 09:07.348
He works really hard at.. At being seen.

09:07.410 --> 09:09.363
I don't like this place.

09:09.364 --> 09:12.484
I don't like it all.

09:19.929 --> 09:23.091
There's a big old guy..

09:23.092 --> 09:27.781
Which probably just looks like a big,
dark scary thing, maybe, to most people.

09:27.782 --> 09:32.162
He likes to freak people out, you know?

09:33.243 --> 09:35.085
Debbie's told me all
about the bizarre things

09:35.086 --> 09:37.378
that she's been seeing
at the Mackay Mansion.

09:37.379 --> 09:40.893
But I can't hang the entire
case on a single eyewitness.

09:40.894 --> 09:44.535
So I'm going to meet with a woman who
allegedly had a terrifying experience

09:44.536 --> 09:48.616
while taking a tour at the mansion.

09:54.234 --> 09:56.509
So, Valerie, when did
you take the tour here?

09:56.510 --> 09:58.707
I took the tour six months ago.

09:58.708 --> 09:59.894
What happened on the tour?

09:59.895 --> 10:03.863
We started to walk, and I was
the last one in the back.

10:03.864 --> 10:09.204
All of a sudden, I hear what
sounded like footsteps.

10:12.373 --> 10:16.402
And I just happened to glance
over, and I saw this..

10:16.403 --> 10:19.187
Tall shadow.. Man.

10:19.188 --> 10:21.828
And he stopped.

10:21.939 --> 10:26.769
Turned around and looked at me with
these evil-looking, glowing eyes.

10:26.770 --> 10:29.355
Did he.. Did he say anything?
Did you hear anything?

10:29.356 --> 10:30.701
He didn't say anything.

10:30.702 --> 10:35.082
He just glared me down with these eyes.

10:36.203 --> 10:39.335
Valerie, after this thing
disappeared, what did you do?

10:39.336 --> 10:42.187
I dropped to my knees and started crying.

10:42.188 --> 10:45.444
I was very hysterical and very scared.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.138
I had nightmares.

10:47.139 --> 10:50.574
It made me wake up every hour..

10:50.575 --> 10:53.956
Every night. And I couldn't sleep.

10:53.957 --> 10:56.589
I want to face my fears,
but at the same time,

10:56.590 --> 10:59.917
I'm scared to death of
what may happen next.

10:59.918 --> 11:03.098
What he might do next.

11:07.986 --> 11:10.110
- You okay?
- Yeah.

11:10.111 --> 11:12.189
What's going on?

11:12.190 --> 11:15.430
I felt like a.. Impact.

11:15.513 --> 11:17.297
Somebody shoving, pushing.

11:17.298 --> 11:19.112
Okay.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.813
Something about..

11:21.815 --> 11:24.084
The ground.

11:24.085 --> 11:28.165
Because it absorbed a lot of death.

11:31.872 --> 11:33.672
Mm.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.980
This is really, really bad.

11:43.282 --> 11:45.420
Both Debbie and Valerie
have seen a shadow figure

11:45.421 --> 11:47.838
stalking the grounds of the Mackay Mansion.

11:47.839 --> 11:49.683
Now I'm on my way to speak
with a third witness

11:49.684 --> 11:53.824
who says he had a similar encounter.

12:00.278 --> 12:02.399
So, Tom, when did you take Debbie's tour?

12:02.400 --> 12:06.408
Uh, it was back in, uh, I
would say November of 2009.

12:06.409 --> 12:08.117
Okay, what happened on that tour?

12:08.118 --> 12:10.765
Down by the gazebo there,
I saw a shadow figure.

12:10.766 --> 12:14.538
So I kind of hung back, you know,
seeing if I could see it again.

12:14.539 --> 12:17.229
And then all of a sudden, it
felt like I was covered in lead.

12:17.230 --> 12:18.832
You know, just heavy, you know?

12:18.833 --> 12:22.133
And, um, trying to move,
and I just couldn't.

12:22.134 --> 12:24.722
At that point, I was panicking pretty good.

12:24.723 --> 12:27.288
And I said to it, you know, "let me go,"

12:27.289 --> 12:29.011
you know, "talk to me or let me go,"

12:29.012 --> 12:33.707
and it was like a.. Like a light
breeze, it just lifted off of me.

12:33.708 --> 12:37.737
So I was pretty skeptical, you
know, then, but, uh, not now.

12:37.738 --> 12:41.098
Not after that experience.

12:48.927 --> 12:50.426
Whoa. (Bleep)

12:50.427 --> 12:52.467
(Bleep)

12:54.950 --> 12:56.525
What's wrong?

12:56.526 --> 12:59.826
I don't like that room.

13:04.718 --> 13:07.389
What's wrong with the room?

13:07.390 --> 13:10.870
It's, like, very dangerous.

13:12.878 --> 13:16.139
It was, like, I walked
in, and it felt like..

13:16.140 --> 13:18.791
I got, like, pushed out.

13:18.792 --> 13:21.316
And there was like this..

13:21.317 --> 13:23.957
Wall of, like..

13:23.973 --> 13:26.660
Like a wall of darkness.

13:26.661 --> 13:31.094
And then I just felt like
I was being pushed out.

13:31.095 --> 13:33.915
And it scared me.

13:42.299 --> 13:46.297
I gotta start digging deeper
into the Mackay Mansion's past.

13:46.298 --> 13:50.350
Especially about the man
who built it, John Mackay.

13:50.351 --> 13:56.251
And in a town this small, the best place
to start is with a local historian.

14:01.604 --> 14:04.363
As you know, I'm investigating the
Mackay Mansion in Virginia City.

14:04.364 --> 14:05.102
Yes.

14:05.103 --> 14:07.939
What I don't know a lot about
is Virginia City itself.

14:07.940 --> 14:11.794
By 1859, we had thousands
of people coming in

14:11.795 --> 14:14.432
with this discovery of gold and silver.

14:14.433 --> 14:19.568
People from around the world were rushing
over here to make their fortunes.

14:19.569 --> 14:20.986
Mining's dangerous today.

14:20.987 --> 14:22.326
How was it then?

14:22.327 --> 14:24.243
Were there any tragedies
close to the Mackay Mansion?

14:24.244 --> 14:25.445
Um, there were.

14:25.446 --> 14:29.604
Um, the.. The way the..
The town is, all the mines are underneath.

14:29.605 --> 14:32.308
The worst one is the
Yellowjacket Mine fire.

14:32.309 --> 14:34.889
That was 1868.

14:35.392 --> 14:39.842
The firemen were trying to save people,
but because of the heat and the smoke,

14:39.843 --> 14:43.620
ultimately, had to, uh, close off the..
The mine shafts.

14:43.621 --> 14:46.861
38 people actually died.

14:48.530 --> 14:50.813
There's like 40 guys.

14:50.814 --> 14:53.932
They're in a group. They're..
They're panicked.

14:53.933 --> 14:56.159
Do you know why?

14:56.160 --> 14:59.640
I think it's work related.

15:00.064 --> 15:01.832
What can you tell me about John Mackay?

15:01.833 --> 15:07.597
Well, he was an Irish immigrant who
came to America in the early 1840s.

15:07.598 --> 15:13.377
Uh, he was broke and had to work
in the mines at $4, um, a day,

15:13.378 --> 15:18.598
and became one of the
wealthiest men in the world.

15:19.728 --> 15:21.726
What can you tell me about Mackay's family?

15:21.727 --> 15:26.467
His wife Louise, her first
husband, he was a dentist,

15:26.468 --> 15:29.716
but by 1863, he died from an overdose.

15:29.717 --> 15:32.854
And so left her alone
with a small daughter.

15:32.855 --> 15:34.290
So how'd she wind up with Mackay?

15:34.291 --> 15:36.604
His mining partner introduced 'em.

15:36.605 --> 15:39.209
Okay, and at some point, they must
have lived in the mansion together?

15:39.210 --> 15:43.190
Yes, and he adopted her, uh, 4-
or 5-year-old daughter that, um,

15:43.191 --> 15:44.305
had a disability.

15:44.306 --> 15:46.751
She had to wear braces on her legs.

15:46.752 --> 15:52.572
Um, but he was wonderful and..
And treated her as his own.

15:53.207 --> 15:55.145
There's a little girl.

15:55.146 --> 15:58.446
The same girl as before.

15:59.010 --> 16:01.086
She's a bad girl.

16:01.087 --> 16:04.395
Like, she likes to scare people.

16:04.396 --> 16:05.883
I guess she's just playing?

16:05.884 --> 16:07.914
Uh.. Yeah.

16:07.915 --> 16:13.815
I mean, she is just playing, but
she's out of control, you know?

16:14.338 --> 16:18.358
She looks healthy, but she wasn't.

16:20.601 --> 16:23.122
So when she meets, uh, John
Mackay, he's not wealthy.

16:23.123 --> 16:26.885
But she was accustomed to, I guess, a
lifestyle of living with a Doctor.

16:26.886 --> 16:29.831
She definitely always felt
that she deserved a..

16:29.832 --> 16:31.845
A decent, uh, lifestyle.

16:31.846 --> 16:33.931
She enjoyed the finer things.

16:33.932 --> 16:38.129
So she wanted to live in the big city
and not in a remote mining town.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.551
- Yes.
- You know, what you're telling me,

16:39.552 --> 16:41.943
I'm curious, what kind of
a marriage did they have?

16:41.944 --> 16:43.629
They wanted different things.

16:43.630 --> 16:45.904
He was a miner, and you can
tell that he loved her,

16:45.905 --> 16:49.057
but she just felt that this
was not the town to be in.

16:49.058 --> 16:52.958
So she decided to move to Paris.

16:54.144 --> 16:56.127
Lots of yelling here.

16:56.128 --> 16:57.753
A lot of yelling.

16:57.754 --> 17:02.434
And it's between a woman and a man mostly.

17:03.555 --> 17:04.638
What about the man?

17:04.640 --> 17:07.839
What is his relationship to her?

17:07.840 --> 17:10.540
They're married.

17:14.861 --> 17:17.435
A lot of hatred.

17:17.436 --> 17:20.462
She leaves a lot, traveling.

17:20.463 --> 17:22.051
She's a nasty..

17:22.053 --> 17:25.532
She's a nasty, nasty lady.

17:27.189 --> 17:30.347
There is a cruel woman who
will not leave me alone.

17:30.348 --> 17:33.009
She keeps appearing in front
of me trying to bully me,

17:33.010 --> 17:36.730
and I can tell she enjoys it.

17:37.542 --> 17:39.686
She's, like..

17:39.687 --> 17:41.847
Laughing.

17:42.185 --> 17:44.585
She's cold.

17:45.542 --> 17:48.664
Physically, like, just.. She's right here.

17:48.665 --> 17:49.465
.

17:55.450 --> 18:00.511
The second I say I don't like this nasty
woman, she gives me an icy touch.

18:00.512 --> 18:04.217
I think she does this to living
people in the house, too.

18:04.218 --> 18:07.038
She's destructive.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.564
I don't like her.

18:09.565 --> 18:12.085
She's creepy.

18:12.527 --> 18:14.858
She doesn't have a soul.

18:14.859 --> 18:17.319
She's empty.

18:18.838 --> 18:22.283
This whole town is connected by
600 miles of underground tunnels

18:22.284 --> 18:25.689
where thousands of miners
died horrible deaths.

18:25.690 --> 18:26.949
So I'm headed over to meet a guy

18:26.950 --> 18:30.254
who knows the mining history
in this town inside and out.

18:30.255 --> 18:34.155
There could be a connection here.

18:38.066 --> 18:41.395
So, Ron, I was talking to a local
historian, and, uh, she mentioned that

18:41.396 --> 18:44.127
there was a lot of mining disasters here.

18:44.128 --> 18:45.840
Mining was extremely dangerous.

18:45.841 --> 18:50.722
You were working down as deep as 3,200
or 3,300 feet below the ground.

18:50.723 --> 18:55.283
And in many cases, 135-degree temperatures.

18:55.684 --> 19:00.113
I was wondering, were any of those
disasters close to the Mackay Mansion?

19:00.114 --> 19:04.706
Yes. One about, uh, 100 yards
from the Mackay Mansion.

19:04.707 --> 19:06.095
You've got the Gould Curry shaft.

19:06.096 --> 19:07.758
A fire broke out, and..

19:07.759 --> 19:09.278
Eleven..

19:09.279 --> 19:11.143
Men lost their lives.

19:11.144 --> 19:13.483
Some of them were literally incinerated.

19:13.484 --> 19:15.036
What caused the fire?

19:15.037 --> 19:17.133
They never determined that.

19:17.134 --> 19:20.882
The air went very quickly, and they
probably died within a matter of hours.

19:20.883 --> 19:22.656
They simply died of suffocation.

19:22.657 --> 19:26.557
So it was a terrible way to go.

19:26.781 --> 19:29.502
Right here. This area. Under the ground.

19:29.503 --> 19:31.873
Something happened in that..

19:31.874 --> 19:34.422
Something on this..

19:34.423 --> 19:37.363
Ground was bad or..

19:38.504 --> 19:41.264
Was worse before.

19:44.111 --> 19:46.975
It was worse. It was worse before.

19:46.976 --> 19:49.872
I just feel, like, a lot of death.

19:49.873 --> 19:54.853
And I also see a lot of
bodies on the ground.

19:56.493 --> 19:59.338
Did you know anyone who died
in these mining disasters?

19:59.339 --> 20:04.585
My great-grandfather died at
3,000-foot level in 1880..

20:04.586 --> 20:05.837
And he was 29.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.147
Can I ask how he died?

20:07.148 --> 20:12.253
Something slipped off of the cage that
hauled, uh, material up and down,

20:12.254 --> 20:15.725
and he was unfortunate enough
to be at the bottom of that.

20:15.726 --> 20:20.132
It decapitated him, and it killed a couple
of other fellas right at that time,

20:20.133 --> 20:22.036
and then another one died later.

20:22.037 --> 20:24.437
Oh, my God.

20:25.861 --> 20:29.881
One guy, he.. Had his head broken.

20:30.928 --> 20:31.693
Yuck.

20:31.694 --> 20:33.734
(Bleep)

20:34.530 --> 20:37.890
Uh, his head was cracked.

20:55.287 --> 20:58.022
There's, like, all these men.

20:58.023 --> 21:00.439
There's probably like 40 guys.

21:00.440 --> 21:03.500
They're all in pain.

21:09.141 --> 21:11.516
That's all I can get off of them.

21:11.517 --> 21:15.366
Because nobody's, uh, well enough..

21:15.367 --> 21:17.527
To talk.

21:18.464 --> 21:20.209
These men are still in their death state,

21:20.210 --> 21:24.020
which means they're reliving their
deaths over and over again.

21:24.021 --> 21:26.985
And they're in too much pain
to communicate with me.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.386
I feel bad.

21:33.740 --> 21:36.278
With so many men dying in
these underground mines,

21:36.279 --> 21:39.998
Virginia City might as well
be built on a graveyard.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.765
But my witnesses aren't seeing men.

21:41.766 --> 21:45.411
They're seeing a young
girl and a shadow figure.

21:45.412 --> 21:47.348
The girl could be Mackay's stepdaughter.

21:47.349 --> 21:51.009
But how do I I.D. a shadow?

21:51.858 --> 21:55.479
All I can do is keep finding
deaths surrounding this place..

21:55.480 --> 21:59.740
And see if Amy can make sense of it.

22:12.271 --> 22:13.761
It turns out a pretty gruesome murder

22:13.762 --> 22:17.035
took place right next to
the mansion in the 1800s.

22:17.036 --> 22:21.836
The victim..
A prostitute named Julia Bulette.

22:24.511 --> 22:27.929
This Julia Bulette
homicide's got my attention.

22:27.930 --> 22:30.506
According to maps, her body
was discovered in her home,

22:30.507 --> 22:33.407
not far from the Mackay Mansion.

22:33.408 --> 22:35.024
I'm headed over to talk to an historian

22:35.025 --> 22:37.159
who's been obsessed with
this case for years.

22:37.160 --> 22:42.320
I'm hoping she can tell
me exactly what happened.

22:55.442 --> 23:01.342
Julia Bulette was a prostitute that
was murdered in January 20, 1867.

23:02.982 --> 23:08.382
She was a very well-loved
and, uh, famous prostitute.

23:08.686 --> 23:10.472
The motive was robbery.

23:10.473 --> 23:14.197
All of her belongings, uh, were taken.

23:14.198 --> 23:16.653
Being that she was a high-end
prostitute back in those days,

23:16.654 --> 23:20.708
would she have serviced men in her
house or would she go to their home?

23:20.709 --> 23:22.988
She did service a lot of
the men in her house..

23:22.989 --> 23:24.496
Probably a lot of the miner men..

23:24.497 --> 23:30.397
But she probably serviced, uh, many
of the mine superintendents as well.

23:30.419 --> 23:33.486
I know the Mackay Mansion used to be
a boarding house for superintendents

23:33.487 --> 23:35.374
before John Mackay bought it.

23:35.375 --> 23:38.719
And given Julia Bulette's
popularity with the men in town,

23:38.720 --> 23:41.837
I have no doubt that she had her own key.

23:41.838 --> 23:45.318
Yeah, that's very possible.

23:45.944 --> 23:47.897
How old was she at the time of her death?

23:47.898 --> 23:50.298
She was 34.

23:52.441 --> 23:55.579
There was a guy around here.

23:55.580 --> 23:57.656
He wanders around the town.

23:57.657 --> 24:01.077
He wanders around in here.

24:01.767 --> 24:04.887
He was killing ladies.

24:06.636 --> 24:09.827
This one lady he killed was..

24:09.828 --> 24:11.557
30s, 40s.

24:11.558 --> 24:13.939
What do you know about the
actual physical damage to her?

24:13.940 --> 24:17.519
She was found laying on
her left side in the bed.

24:17.520 --> 24:22.019
Um, and she had two, uh, blunt
force traumas to the head.

24:22.020 --> 24:24.856
And then she had a pillow
placed over her face.

24:24.857 --> 24:26.298
Was somebody arrested in this case?

24:26.299 --> 24:29.996
Yes. There was a gentleman named
John Milleain who was arrested.

24:29.997 --> 24:31.326
Okay, was he a local?

24:31.327 --> 24:35.227
Um, no. He was a French drifter.

24:36.608 --> 24:39.118
He, like, didn't live here.

24:39.119 --> 24:41.456
Uh, or anywhere around here.

24:41.457 --> 24:43.123
He'd travel all over.

24:43.124 --> 24:45.012
He was..

24:45.013 --> 24:46.097
Like a roamer.

24:46.098 --> 24:48.618
He was crazy.

24:54.466 --> 24:55.887
Did Milleain ever go to trial?

24:55.888 --> 24:58.099
Yes. John Milleain, uh, did go to trial.

24:58.100 --> 24:59.897
The trial lasted only two days.

24:59.898 --> 25:01.447
Did he admit to it?

25:01.448 --> 25:05.111
He admitted to having been
there at her property,

25:05.112 --> 25:07.321
uh, but claimed that he was
with two other gentlemen

25:07.322 --> 25:08.770
who actually did the attack.

25:08.771 --> 25:09.662
Was he convicted?

25:09.663 --> 25:13.383
Yes, he was sentenced to hang.

25:14.738 --> 25:16.150
It was quite the spectacle.

25:16.151 --> 25:19.050
I would say the majority
of the town turned out.

25:19.051 --> 25:22.725
There were two days in Virginia City's
history that the bars were closed.

25:22.726 --> 25:24.316
One was the day of her funeral

25:24.317 --> 25:29.777
and the other was the day
that her killer was hanged.

25:36.150 --> 25:38.305
I'm seeing a hanging around here.

25:38.306 --> 25:39.056
Okay.

25:39.057 --> 25:42.007
There's some wacko guy hanging..

25:42.008 --> 25:44.438
Swinging in the breeze.

25:44.439 --> 25:45.904
Swinging in the breeze.

25:45.905 --> 25:47.500
What's he hanging from?

25:47.501 --> 25:49.612
A tree, I think.

25:49.613 --> 25:51.317
I don't know.

25:51.318 --> 25:55.638
It may be symbolic. It's psychic, so..

25:55.715 --> 25:58.662
Images of a hanging are
flashing through my mind.

25:58.663 --> 26:00.514
I'm seeing a picture of what happened here,

26:00.515 --> 26:04.346
and this execution had
everyone's attention.

26:04.347 --> 26:07.587
Something about justice..

26:08.014 --> 26:12.154
Like, I just see the word "justice."

26:26.313 --> 26:29.198
I came across a lot of dead
people during my walk,

26:29.199 --> 26:33.137
but the nasty woman with the
icy-cold touch is standing over me,

26:33.138 --> 26:38.080
and she's demanding that I sketch
her the way she sees herself.

26:38.081 --> 26:40.136
She would be..

26:40.137 --> 26:43.257
Mid 30s to early 40s.

26:47.315 --> 26:50.615
What shape was her face?

26:52.055 --> 26:54.126
Her face is round.

26:54.127 --> 26:56.422
She has very thin lips.

26:56.423 --> 27:01.158
Was the..
Lower lip as thin as the upper lip?

27:01.159 --> 27:06.019
It's a little bit larger
than the upper lip.

27:07.546 --> 27:10.928
She is really angry, and she..

27:10.929 --> 27:14.058
Wants to look a certain way.

27:14.059 --> 27:16.186
Her hair is dark.

27:16.187 --> 27:19.067
Eyelashes are dark.

27:22.343 --> 27:25.403
Is this who you saw?

27:25.867 --> 27:27.727
Yes.

27:51.776 --> 27:54.903
Over the last several days, Amy
and I have been conducting

27:54.904 --> 27:57.854
completely separate investigations.

27:57.855 --> 28:03.315
Tonight will be the first
time we reveal our findings.

28:03.693 --> 28:06.114
Debbie is the tour guide here.

28:06.115 --> 28:09.426
Uh, she loves this job and she
doesn't want to leave it.

28:09.427 --> 28:13.579
But she's having some experiences
that has her a little frightened.

28:13.580 --> 28:16.662
Valerie, uh, was actually..
Took a tour here,

28:16.663 --> 28:19.490
and during the tour, she was traumatized

28:19.491 --> 28:22.010
to the point where she
didn't sleep for two weeks.

28:22.011 --> 28:24.222
She had nightmares.

28:24.223 --> 28:25.790
She needs answers.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.751
She wants to face her fears and
find out what's going on here,

28:28.752 --> 28:31.345
so that's why they called us in.

28:31.346 --> 28:37.246
So with that being said, maybe Amy
could tell us about her walk.

28:42.261 --> 28:47.598
I saw this crazy guy who was
killing a lot of women.

28:47.599 --> 28:51.592
You know, he did all this..
Strangled these women, mutilated them.

28:51.593 --> 28:54.086
It wasn't just one.. One lady.

28:54.087 --> 28:56.300
He makes me feel sick.

28:56.301 --> 28:59.541
He was, like, a roamer.

28:59.818 --> 29:04.258
He was killing ladies
and he was crazy.

29:10.673 --> 29:14.071
You know, Amy, that sounds a lot
like the Julia Bulette case.

29:14.072 --> 29:17.397
Before John Mackay had lived here, this
was the home for the superintendents.

29:17.398 --> 29:19.567
Most of the time, they didn't
have their wives with them.

29:19.568 --> 29:22.758
So the chances of Julia
Bulette, who was a prostitute

29:22.759 --> 29:24.375
literally a couple of blocks from here,

29:24.376 --> 29:27.127
servicing the men in this
house is pretty good.

29:27.128 --> 29:30.488
Here's a picture of her.

29:30.733 --> 29:35.227
She was 34 when she was murdered,
literally a couple of blocks from here,

29:35.228 --> 29:37.078
uh, by a drifter.

29:37.079 --> 29:37.971
Wow.

29:37.972 --> 29:40.892
She was bludgeoned about the head,

29:40.893 --> 29:43.308
uh, blunt force trauma, and
she was strangled to death.

29:43.309 --> 29:44.335
And when they found her, they had..

29:44.336 --> 29:45.982
There was a pillow over her face also.

29:45.983 --> 29:49.402
So this guy John Milleain, who I have
a photo of, when he murdered her,

29:49.403 --> 29:53.359
I guess he wanted to
make sure she was dead.

29:53.360 --> 29:57.560
It wasn't the first time he did it.

29:58.455 --> 30:00.992
I also saw a hanging.

30:00.993 --> 30:02.853
Hmm.

30:03.617 --> 30:06.272
Hanging from a tree, like swaying.

30:06.273 --> 30:10.353
I did see the.. The word "justice."

30:10.557 --> 30:12.160
That makes sense.

30:12.161 --> 30:13.867
Totally makes sense.

30:13.868 --> 30:16.761
He was convicted in two days of her murder.

30:16.762 --> 30:21.322
But it took a year
before he was hanged.

30:25.095 --> 30:29.987
What I saw was residual energy, like a
piece of a movie replaying over and over.

30:29.988 --> 30:34.035
I saw a man killing women, but I
couldn't make out his features.

30:34.036 --> 30:36.116
I also saw a hanging.

30:36.117 --> 30:39.305
So now this all makes sense.

30:39.306 --> 30:40.328
What else did you see?

30:40.329 --> 30:42.476
This woman..

30:42.477 --> 30:44.577
Who was

30:44.585 --> 30:46.962
extremely angry.

30:46.963 --> 30:49.992
And she was yelling at her husband.

30:49.993 --> 30:53.100
Um, she apparently had..

30:53.101 --> 30:57.343
Had a much better lifestyle
before she moved here.

30:57.344 --> 30:58.737
And went with him.

30:58.738 --> 31:03.298
And she was missing that upscale lifestyle.

31:03.524 --> 31:06.017
And she was standing by me..

31:06.018 --> 31:10.482
And she put her arm on my arm,
and it was, like, ice cold.

31:10.483 --> 31:12.343
Ice.

31:14.132 --> 31:17.045
She's, like, destructive. Um..

31:17.046 --> 31:19.735
I don't like her.

31:19.736 --> 31:20.914
She's right here.

31:20.915 --> 31:21.715
.

31:25.979 --> 31:27.233
Debbie, let me ask you a question, though.

31:27.234 --> 31:30.061
On the tours you do, has anybody
ever described that to you?

31:30.062 --> 31:32.426
Oh, yeah. People all the time will say..

31:32.427 --> 31:34.506
"You know, my God, it's so
freezing cold right here,"

31:34.507 --> 31:39.127
and they'll move one foot, and it's gone.

31:41.475 --> 31:44.620
She used to travel a lot. And..

31:44.621 --> 31:47.365
She was just a nasty..

31:47.366 --> 31:48.641
Nasty lady.

31:48.642 --> 31:51.664
I don't really like her.

31:51.665 --> 31:53.705
Mackay.

31:54.073 --> 31:57.159
The woman you describe sounds
awfully like Louise Mackay,

31:57.160 --> 31:59.769
the wife of John Mackay, who
the mansion's named after.

31:59.770 --> 32:02.350
He lived here.

32:08.897 --> 32:10.344
He's an immigrant from Ireland.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.753
He came here, worked
$4 a day as a miner,

32:12.754 --> 32:15.385
and later on became one of
the richest men in America.

32:15.386 --> 32:19.499
And he married a woman named Louise.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.263
They lived here, but she
hated Virginia City.

32:22.264 --> 32:24.518
She didn't like it.
She felt she was above it.

32:24.519 --> 32:29.404
Uh, she came from a pretty
upper-class, uh, background,

32:29.405 --> 32:30.779
and the marriage wasn't really much.

32:30.780 --> 32:32.889
I mean, she spent most
of her time in Paris.

32:32.890 --> 32:36.205
Uh, so they didn't really
have a great marriage.

32:36.206 --> 32:37.707
Uh..

32:37.708 --> 32:41.147
Wh.. I see that look on your face.
What is it?

32:41.148 --> 32:45.168
Um, well, actually, I sketched her.

32:49.029 --> 32:53.899
All I remember about the sketch is that
she made me do her hair in this, like,

32:53.900 --> 32:59.468
ridiculous curly hairstyle that
took forever for the artist to do.

32:59.469 --> 33:01.247
Wh.. What did you mean, she made you?

33:01.248 --> 33:03.408
She was throwing a fit.

33:03.409 --> 33:04.334
While you were doing the sketch?

33:04.335 --> 33:06.255
Yeah.

33:26.863 --> 33:30.103
You girls look at this.

33:33.795 --> 33:36.315
(Mouths words)

33:39.242 --> 33:42.062
Not a happy lady.

33:44.547 --> 33:46.499
That's pretty good.

33:46.500 --> 33:50.040
It has the same scowl look.

33:54.645 --> 34:00.132
She's got that same look, I mean, in the
eyes, you know, just not.. Not happy.

34:00.133 --> 34:03.120
It's like a combination of both.
Hmm.

34:03.121 --> 34:06.088
And she does not like people here.

34:06.089 --> 34:07.407
Hates it.

34:07.408 --> 34:10.136
Even though she hated the place herself?

34:10.137 --> 34:10.915
Well, yeah.

34:10.916 --> 34:15.356
Anything she thought she owned, she owns.

34:15.411 --> 34:18.310
This was her space.

34:18.311 --> 34:20.935
This woman may have hated
this place in life,

34:20.936 --> 34:23.625
but I'm not surprised she
came back here in death.

34:23.626 --> 34:25.797
The dead often come back to the locations

34:25.799 --> 34:28.683
that had the most meaning in their lives.

34:28.684 --> 34:31.397
So when.. If Debbie comes in with a
tour with somebody like Valerie,

34:31.398 --> 34:32.917
I mean, she doesn't like that.

34:32.918 --> 34:34.717
No.

34:36.744 --> 34:39.094
Amy, what else did you see?

34:39.096 --> 34:40.405
A young girl.

34:40.406 --> 34:44.192
She is very ill, but she doesn't look it.

34:44.193 --> 34:46.833
And she likes..

34:47.784 --> 34:50.784
To freak people out.

34:50.980 --> 34:53.275
She likes to get on the beds..

34:53.277 --> 34:55.474
And, um, jump on things.

34:55.475 --> 34:59.195
So, yeah, she's pretty active.

35:00.425 --> 35:02.918
Debbie actually had some..

35:02.919 --> 35:04.426
What would you call it, a test?

35:04.427 --> 35:05.375
We just asked her..

35:05.376 --> 35:07.609
"Can you do something to let
us know that you're here?"

35:07.610 --> 35:10.190
And.. She did.

35:10.363 --> 35:13.294
You know, she closed the toy box lid and..

35:13.295 --> 35:16.377
Made the blanket move, and it
was like, "yeah, here I am."

35:16.378 --> 35:17.685
Wow.

35:17.686 --> 35:20.587
You saw the girl that
obviously Amy knows is here.

35:20.588 --> 35:22.094
Uh, how does that make you feel?

35:22.095 --> 35:24.924
I.. I think the way that
you explained it, Amy,

35:24.925 --> 35:30.355
when you described her, that's the
feeling that I get when I'm up there.

35:30.356 --> 35:34.321
Louise Mackay, she was a widow
whose husband had died.

35:34.322 --> 35:35.613
He was a Doctor.

35:35.614 --> 35:37.374
But they had a young girl, a daughter.

35:37.375 --> 35:38.282
Oh.

35:38.283 --> 35:41.529
And the daughter had braces on her legs.

35:41.530 --> 35:45.610
John Mackay adopted her as his own.

35:51.583 --> 35:54.572
So did you see this girl's face?

35:54.573 --> 35:57.728
No. She wouldn't let me.

35:57.729 --> 36:01.199
I hate not knowing if Mackay's
stepdaughter is this little girl,

36:01.200 --> 36:06.167
but at least I know she's not the
one terrorizing people around here.

36:06.168 --> 36:10.177
The other thing that
I saw was, uh..

36:10.178 --> 36:13.718
This really tall, dark mass.

36:13.817 --> 36:17.891
And it was definitely masculine energy.

36:17.892 --> 36:20.563
And this individual

36:20.564 --> 36:23.503
really likes to scare people.

36:23.504 --> 36:29.374
Like, to other people, he looks
very ominous and very scary.

36:29.375 --> 36:31.235
Wow.

36:32.161 --> 36:33.907
Ooh.

36:33.908 --> 36:35.828
What?

36:38.266 --> 36:41.146
Are you all right?

36:53.205 --> 36:55.697
The other thing that I saw was

36:55.698 --> 36:59.238
this really tall, dark mass.

37:00.357 --> 37:02.689
He looks very ominous.

37:02.690 --> 37:05.330
And very scary.

37:07.618 --> 37:10.498
Are you all right?

37:16.025 --> 37:18.305
Okay, so..

37:19.532 --> 37:21.410
At the tour..

37:21.411 --> 37:23.463
All of a sudden..

37:23.464 --> 37:27.484
This tall, dark, shadow man figure.

37:28.528 --> 37:32.010
Walks right between us. And..

37:32.011 --> 37:33.922
He stops.

37:33.923 --> 37:39.823
Turns around and looks straight at me
with these evil-looking, glowing eyes.

37:39.929 --> 37:42.389
And he was..

37:42.517 --> 37:44.569
So angry.

37:44.570 --> 37:47.417
I literally dropped down to my knees..

37:47.418 --> 37:50.026
And started bawling my eyes out.

37:50.027 --> 37:53.332
After that, two..
For two weeks, every single night..

37:53.333 --> 37:55.956
I had nightmares of him.

37:55.957 --> 37:59.497
I had his face in my head.

38:00.982 --> 38:03.336
Now Debby's seen this thing also.

38:03.337 --> 38:06.501
You could feel..
Feel it in the pit of your stomach.

38:06.502 --> 38:08.069
You know, his presence.

38:08.070 --> 38:10.735
And it.. It was terrifying.

38:10.736 --> 38:15.029
And it's always that feeling of dread,
the feeling of "you need to get away"

38:15.030 --> 38:19.470
"from wherever he is and away from him."

38:25.628 --> 38:28.235
Both of you have seen the
results of the investigation.

38:28.236 --> 38:30.444
And heard about Amy's walk.

38:30.445 --> 38:33.003
The reason you called us in
is because you wanna know

38:33.004 --> 38:36.649
if it's safe or not to be here or..
Or what it is.

38:36.650 --> 38:38.512
I can't answer that. Only Amy can.

38:38.513 --> 38:42.113
So, Amy, if you can, please.

38:44.564 --> 38:49.784
The man that you saw in
the yard cannot hurt you.

38:51.218 --> 38:54.818
He's just a practical joker.

38:57.730 --> 39:00.996
So I think the best way
to approach this..

39:00.997 --> 39:03.796
Is not to fall for it.

39:03.797 --> 39:07.697
Because he thinks it's hilarious.

39:08.992 --> 39:11.163
So basically..

39:11.164 --> 39:13.703
Don't feed into it and he'll..

39:13.704 --> 39:16.164
Wander about.

39:16.165 --> 39:19.755
But there are two other issues
that do need to be dealt with.

39:19.756 --> 39:22.516
And one is the..

39:22.661 --> 39:24.152
The girl.

39:24.153 --> 39:26.948
Um, she should not be here.

39:26.949 --> 39:29.949
She needs to go on.

39:30.351 --> 39:33.296
I hate seeing dead children
stuck in a location.

39:33.297 --> 39:37.551
This little girl needs to
move on to a better place.

39:37.552 --> 39:43.036
The best way for her to do that would
be for another medium to come in..

39:43.037 --> 39:44.428
To talk to her.

39:44.429 --> 39:48.869
And hopefully, for the medium to, um c..

39:50.337 --> 39:56.237
Counsel her into seeing that it's
better if she completely goes.

39:56.872 --> 40:00.558
Unfortunately, I can't do it
because it does take a few days.

40:00.559 --> 40:03.977
But I can definitely interview
anybody that you find

40:03.978 --> 40:06.767
that you feel comfortable with.

40:06.768 --> 40:10.968
Um, and then the other one is this..

40:11.292 --> 40:13.632
Nasty lady.

40:14.219 --> 40:17.695
She just does not need to be here.

40:17.696 --> 40:23.336
The only problem is, that
would have to be done by an..

40:23.448 --> 40:26.208
Through exorcism..

40:27.995 --> 40:31.802
Which is something I very,
very rarely recommend.

40:31.803 --> 40:34.766
You know, Amy, I never even
heard you say that word before.

40:34.767 --> 40:36.634
She does need to leave.

40:36.635 --> 40:39.142
This isn't her domain.

40:39.143 --> 40:41.451
And she doesn't need to
be bothering people.

40:41.452 --> 40:46.365
But it needs to be done by someone
who will make sure that she..

40:46.366 --> 40:49.034
Moves on not out.

40:49.035 --> 40:53.115
- Yeah.
- There's a big difference.

40:53.858 --> 40:57.007
Most people think only
demons need to be exorcised.

40:57.008 --> 41:00.775
But in some extreme cases, dead
people can become so powerful,

41:00.776 --> 41:03.834
it's the only way to drive
them out of a location.

41:03.835 --> 41:05.001
Let me ask you a question, though.

41:05.002 --> 41:06.985
Are you gonna listen to what
Amy says, and what to do?

41:06.986 --> 41:09.750
Absolutely. I mean, I..
I feel empowered now.

41:09.751 --> 41:11.425
- Good.
- It's not something that I have

41:11.426 --> 41:13.261
to run away from and fear..

41:13.262 --> 41:14.071
- Mm-hmm.
- And that

41:14.072 --> 41:17.232
gives me the power to not be afraid.

41:17.233 --> 41:18.926
What about you, Valerie? How do you feel?

41:18.927 --> 41:22.083
I was terrified because I
thought that he was evil.

41:22.084 --> 41:24.844
But now I feel..

41:25.959 --> 41:27.248
100 times better.

41:27.249 --> 41:28.355
Alright, good.

41:28.356 --> 41:30.276
Good.

41:30.900 --> 41:33.325
I almost never recommend an exorcism.

41:33.326 --> 41:35.365
But this woman's energy is so negative,

41:35.366 --> 41:40.314
there might never be peace in this
house until they get rid of her.
