WEBVTT

00:09.133 --> 00:10.667
- Life.
It's literally all we have.

00:10.767 --> 00:12.267
But is it any good?

00:12.367 --> 00:15.833
I'm a reviewer, but I don't
review food, books, or movies.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.067
I review life itself.

00:18.167 --> 00:19.533
[screams]

00:19.633 --> 00:21.500
[triumphant music]

00:21.600 --> 00:22.400
[parrot squawks]

00:22.500 --> 00:26.700
*

00:26.800 --> 00:27.400
- Over here.

00:27.500 --> 00:33.167
*

00:33.267 --> 00:35.233
- Hello and welcome to "Review."

00:35.333 --> 00:36.567
I am Forrest MacNeil, reviewer.

00:36.667 --> 00:40.367
A.J., do you think you can
kick us off with a review?

00:40.467 --> 00:42.633
- First review comes
from Palmita

00:42.733 --> 00:44.000
in Hillsborough, Arkansas.

00:44.100 --> 00:45.400
- Palmita.

00:53.433 --> 00:55.000
- You're kidding me.
- [laughs]

00:55.100 --> 00:57.600
- That is a ghoulish question.
- Ugh!

00:57.700 --> 01:00.300
- Thankfully, I am only
moderately claustrophobic,

01:00.400 --> 01:03.133
otherwise, this would be a much
more terrifying undertaking.

01:03.233 --> 01:05.567
- "Undertaking."
Forrest.

01:05.667 --> 01:08.067
- Oh.
That was not intentional.

01:08.167 --> 01:12.333
The puns I make on purpose are
quite a bit funnier than that.

01:12.433 --> 01:15.600
Well, here I go. I'm off to find
out what it's like to be...

01:15.700 --> 01:16.467
buried alive.

01:16.567 --> 01:18.300
Ahoy there!

01:18.400 --> 01:21.333
The first step to being buried
alive turned out to be

01:21.433 --> 01:23.500
bribing a cemetery
groundskeeper,

01:23.600 --> 01:24.467
who was insane.

01:24.567 --> 01:26.600
- You out here looking
for zombies?

01:26.700 --> 01:28.433
- Beg your pardon?

01:28.533 --> 01:32.100
- Sometimes we get these meth-
head idiots lookin' for zombies.

01:32.200 --> 01:35.133
- Yeah, no, no, I'm just sad
about a dead person.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.967
- You masturbate on
the tombstones,

01:40.067 --> 01:42.800
make sure you clean up
after your mess.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.867
- Goes without saying.

01:44.967 --> 01:47.933
After that, my intern,
his girlfriend, and I were free

01:48.067 --> 01:50.533
to put our flimsy homemade
coffin anywhere we wanted.

01:50.633 --> 01:55.133
My casket is equipped with an
air tube and a little light.

01:55.233 --> 01:56.900
It is now 1:15 a.m.

01:57.067 --> 01:59.833
At exactly 1:15 a.m. tomorrow,
you will dig me up.

02:00.067 --> 02:01.133
Ugh!

02:01.233 --> 02:03.467
- Rest in peace, Forrest.

02:03.567 --> 02:05.667
- This part's more fun.

02:05.767 --> 02:09.267
- As the sound of dirt piling
atop this coffin grows softer,

02:09.367 --> 02:12.367
I just find myself wanting
to call out,

02:12.467 --> 02:17.833
"Stop! I'm still alive!
Don't go!" You know?

02:17.933 --> 02:20.067
Maybe the only thing more
terrifying than that sound

02:20.167 --> 02:22.267
is gonna be the moment
that it stops.

02:22.367 --> 02:26.367
[shoveling stops]

02:26.467 --> 02:30.300
Yep.
That is more terrifying.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.967
- Bye, Mr. MacNeil.
- Good luck.

02:33.067 --> 02:36.333
- I soon discovered that as
morbid as this was,

02:36.433 --> 02:38.300
and as lonely as it was,

02:38.400 --> 02:41.667
it was mostly horrifically,
oppressively boring.

02:41.767 --> 02:43.433
[snoring]

02:43.533 --> 02:46.233
I slept for a very refreshing
nine hours,

02:46.333 --> 02:48.100
but then I was bored again.

02:48.200 --> 02:52.733
[video game beeping]

02:52.833 --> 02:55.233
I never get to play the games
on my phone, you know.

02:55.333 --> 02:56.567
I'm always so busy, but now--

02:56.667 --> 03:00.800
[phone rings]
Oh! Suzanne.

03:00.900 --> 03:04.233
I had not spoken with my
ex-wife Suzanne since my review

03:04.333 --> 03:05.367
of making our son's
wish come true...

03:05.467 --> 03:07.900
- For mom and me to move in
with Joe Dale, Jr.

03:08.067 --> 03:10.600
- Sadly forced me to convince
her to move in

03:10.700 --> 03:12.900
with her frequently unfaithful
boyfriend,

03:13.067 --> 03:14.667
and now she was calling me.

03:14.767 --> 03:17.400
Perhaps she had finally come
to her senses.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.200
Maybe she was even willing to
give us another chance.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.767
Hey!
How's it going?

03:21.867 --> 03:22.967
- [phone cuts out]
Trouble hearing you.

03:23.067 --> 03:24.267
Are you there?

03:24.367 --> 03:26.100
- Yes, I'm here.
I'm here, what's up?

03:26.200 --> 03:28.067
- Very important news.
So--

03:28.100 --> 03:29.400
- Okay, stop, stop, stop.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.567
All I heard was that you have
important news.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.933
- [garbled]
- I can't hear you.

03:35.067 --> 03:37.933
- I-I'm getting married,
is what I'm trying to tell you.

03:40.633 --> 03:42.433
- Okay.

03:42.533 --> 03:43.533
Far from coming to her senses,

03:43.633 --> 03:46.800
she had now taken full leave
of them.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.967
What could I possibly say
to this horrible news?

03:50.067 --> 03:51.433
Uh, that's great.

03:51.533 --> 03:55.167
- What?
I can't hear you.

03:55.267 --> 03:56.733
- That is great.

03:56.833 --> 03:59.667
Any hope I had ever had
of being with Suzanne again,

03:59.767 --> 04:01.933
of putting our family back
together,

04:02.067 --> 04:04.700
was now shut tighter than this
cheap wooden box.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.067
- Really, really hap--
We're so happy.

04:06.167 --> 04:08.800
[phone beeps]
- Oh.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.267
Before that phone call,
I felt completely

04:11.367 --> 04:13.167
out of my element
in this coffin.

04:13.267 --> 04:17.067
Now, I felt right at home.

04:17.100 --> 04:19.267
When, after 24 hours,
Josh called to tell me

04:19.367 --> 04:20.600
he was on his way
to dig me up...

04:20.700 --> 04:22.367
Hello.

04:22.467 --> 04:23.633
I could not have cared less.

04:23.733 --> 04:25.733
Whatever.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.767
But my perspective changed
rather quickly.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.067
- Yep?
- Hey, Mr. Mac--[garbled]

04:30.167 --> 04:32.600
Do you remember where you are?
Are you by, like, a tree?

04:32.700 --> 04:35.633
- Okay, are you telling me that
you don't know where I am?

04:35.733 --> 04:38.667
- You're by a tree, aren't you?
[phone beeps]

04:38.767 --> 04:41.433
- [laughs]
He doesn't know where I am.

04:41.533 --> 04:45.333
[laughs]
Oh.

04:45.433 --> 04:47.200
Oh, that's interesting.

04:47.300 --> 04:50.767
I only told one person
where I am,

04:50.867 --> 04:54.333
and it was...

04:54.433 --> 04:56.200
the stupidest person I know.

04:56.300 --> 04:59.667
[laughs]

04:59.767 --> 05:02.200
Help!
Can you hear me up there?

05:02.300 --> 05:04.767
If you can hear my voice,
start digging!

05:04.867 --> 05:06.367
[crickets chirping
and owl hooting]

05:06.467 --> 05:09.100
Get me out of here!
I gotta get out of here.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.467
Suzanne had crushed my spirit.

05:10.567 --> 05:13.700
My life now seemed
utterly pointless.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.400
And yet, faced
with the possibility of being

05:15.500 --> 05:18.667
lost forever in the bowels
of the Earth,

05:18.767 --> 05:20.133
something in me stirred.

05:20.233 --> 05:22.067
[punches coffin]
Aah!

05:22.100 --> 05:22.733
Gotta get out of here!
Let me out of here!

05:22.833 --> 05:24.800
Let me out!

05:24.900 --> 05:26.900
[panting]

05:27.067 --> 05:29.833
[grunting and yelling]

05:29.933 --> 05:31.800
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

05:31.900 --> 05:36.333
My incredible and inspiring
refusal to lie down and die

05:36.433 --> 05:38.333
sent my fists
shattering through

05:38.433 --> 05:40.333
a thin layer of particle board,

05:40.433 --> 05:44.300
and clawing through soil to
face what was left of my life,

05:44.400 --> 05:46.267
and triumph.

05:46.367 --> 05:51.300
- Holy [bleep].
Zombies! Zombies!

05:51.400 --> 05:52.667
- Oh, that explains
the bandage.

05:52.767 --> 05:58.133
- Yes, I was mistaken for a
fictional flesh-eating monster.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.467
While I did enjoy the forced
solitude

05:59.567 --> 06:02.767
and the chance to reflect
free from distraction,

06:02.867 --> 06:06.133
the experience of being buried
alive carries too high a risk

06:06.233 --> 06:09.667
of turning into the experience
of being buried dead.

06:09.767 --> 06:12.967
Being buried alive:
half a star.

06:17.800 --> 06:22.633
[triumphant music]

06:22.733 --> 06:25.900
- This review comes from Eugenia
in Lake Lure, North Carolina.

06:26.067 --> 06:28.633
- Uh-huh!
- Hey, Forrest.

06:28.733 --> 06:30.867
I love it when you
give something five stars.

06:30.967 --> 06:35.067
But what would it be like
to give something six stars?

06:35.133 --> 06:39.633
- Uh...no.
I-I can't do that.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.967
I--you know, I rate things on
a scale of one to five stars.

06:43.067 --> 06:45.533
- So what?
Give something six stars.

06:45.633 --> 06:47.700
- No, I can't do that.
I mean, if the scale can change,

06:47.800 --> 06:48.700
then anything can change,
and then none of this

06:48.800 --> 06:50.933
means anything at all.

06:51.067 --> 06:53.233
Looks like I'm...

06:53.333 --> 06:56.067
gonna have to use
one of my vetoes.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.067
- Yes!
Finally the veto!

06:58.133 --> 06:59.200
- Yeah!

06:59.300 --> 07:00.433
[dramatic music]

07:00.533 --> 07:04.067
Yep, I can veto two reviews
this season,

07:04.133 --> 07:05.700
and I haven't done it yet,
but this task

07:05.800 --> 07:09.100
is totally impossible,
so it looks like...

07:09.200 --> 07:10.167
I'm gonna have to veto it!

07:10.267 --> 07:12.133
[drum roll]

07:12.233 --> 07:15.400
No, wait a minute.
No, I have an idea.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.300
No veto. No veto.
I figured this out.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.633
Okay, what's it like
to give something six stars?

07:20.733 --> 07:21.800
I'm gonna go find out.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.833
[triumphant music]

07:24.933 --> 07:28.267
*

07:28.367 --> 07:32.267
Hello, I'm Forrest MacNeil,
and welcome to "Assess."

07:32.367 --> 07:35.067
Whatever life experience
you're curious about,

07:35.133 --> 07:38.067
I will do it
and then I will assess it

07:38.167 --> 07:42.133
on a scale
of two to six stars.

07:42.233 --> 07:45.100
I have created this show
expressly for the purpose

07:45.200 --> 07:47.567
of giving something
six stars.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.267
It's a whole new show.
- Whoopee.

07:49.367 --> 07:52.433
- Now, please, A.J.,
what is our first rev--no.

07:52.533 --> 07:56.333
Our--our first assessment?

07:56.433 --> 08:00.067
- Natasha from Homer, Alaska.

08:00.133 --> 08:01.533
- Hi, Forrest.
I'm lactose intolerant,

08:01.633 --> 08:06.633
so what's it like to have
the best ice cream in town?

08:06.733 --> 08:08.733
- Oh, well, that's fantastic.
- Mm-hmm.

08:08.833 --> 08:11.067
- I have a feeling that this
might just get

08:11.100 --> 08:12.300
my highest rating.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.433
- Oh.
- Of six stars.

08:14.533 --> 08:17.100
- Yep.
- [chuckles] Okay!

08:17.200 --> 08:20.333
By popular consensus,
the best ice cream in my town

08:20.433 --> 08:22.800
can be found at this artisanal
ice cream truck.

08:22.900 --> 08:26.067
May I have one chocolate
ice cream cone, please?

08:26.167 --> 08:29.533
It was absolutely delicious.

08:29.633 --> 08:31.333
This is absolutely delicious.

08:31.433 --> 08:34.567
Rich, but not too rich,
cocoa-y, sweet,

08:34.667 --> 08:36.733
with a subtle hint of nutmeg.

08:36.833 --> 08:40.833
Quite simply, the best
ice cream I had ever had.

08:44.233 --> 08:47.700
No.
Oh, no, no.

08:47.800 --> 08:51.600
Damn it.
Oh, oh, that's worse, ugh.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.067
Eating the best ice cream
in town

08:53.100 --> 08:56.200
was a very pleasant experience.

08:56.300 --> 08:59.067
Each bite was tiny scoop
of heaven.

08:59.167 --> 09:02.600
But I've spent
this entire day

09:02.700 --> 09:06.900
with a chocolate smudge
on my shirt.

09:07.067 --> 09:11.333
So, unfortunately I cannot,
in good conscience,

09:11.433 --> 09:15.233
give this experience
six stars.

09:15.333 --> 09:19.300
Eating the best ice cream
in town, 5 1/2 stars.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.067
This might take longer
than I expected.

09:25.167 --> 09:27.500
- Yeah.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.433
*

09:33.567 --> 09:35.967
Welcome to "Evaluate,"

09:36.067 --> 09:41.800
the show where I evaluate life
on a scale of six to six stars.

09:41.900 --> 09:45.400
Every evaluation on this show
gets six stars.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.467
On to our first evaluation, A.J.

09:47.567 --> 09:50.900
- Okay, it's from a viewer
named Haddie

09:51.067 --> 09:51.667
from Wilmington, Delaware.

09:51.767 --> 09:53.367
- All righty.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.867
- As a woman,
I've always been curious,

09:56.967 --> 10:00.033
what's it like to be kicked
in the balls?

10:00.133 --> 10:03.233
- [sighs]
You got to be kidding me.

10:03.333 --> 10:04.800
I guess I'm going to need
to find someone

10:04.900 --> 10:05.967
to kick me in the balls.

10:06.067 --> 10:06.667
I'll be perfectly honest
with you, A.J., this--

10:06.767 --> 10:08.633
Aaaah!

10:08.733 --> 10:10.433
Ohh! Oh, [bleep]!
- Oh, no, no, no.

10:10.533 --> 10:13.700
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God, I'm--I'm so sorry.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.200
I thought you said for me
to do it.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.200
- No, I didn't say that.
Ah!

10:17.300 --> 10:18.400
But it's very helpful,
thank you.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.133
- I'm sorry!
- Oh, my God, wow!

10:21.233 --> 10:22.933
[groans]
[bleep].

10:23.033 --> 10:26.767
It's an agony that starts
in my left testicle and just

10:26.867 --> 10:28.833
ripples out to every corner
of my body.

10:28.933 --> 10:30.900
- Oh, God, that's just--
that's weird that it starts

10:31.000 --> 10:33.033
in your left testicle.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.667
- Oh, no.
Uh, that makes me realize,

10:34.767 --> 10:37.600
you only kicked me in the
left testicle and that [bleep]

10:37.700 --> 10:41.800
old lady wants to know what it's
like to be kicked in both balls!

10:41.900 --> 10:43.433
Plural!
She said, "Kicked in the balls."

10:43.533 --> 10:44.267
- No, please, don't make me
do this again, Forrest.

10:44.367 --> 10:46.833
- A.J., A.J., A.J., please!

10:46.933 --> 10:49.833
Kick me in the right ball!
- Oh, my--

10:49.933 --> 10:51.233
- Otherwise,
I cannot evaluate this.

10:51.333 --> 10:52.933
Let's go, just do it,
just do it!

10:53.033 --> 10:53.733
[both scream]

10:53.833 --> 10:55.733
[wheezing]

10:55.833 --> 10:58.167
[whimpering]

10:58.267 --> 10:59.500
- Did I get it?

10:59.600 --> 11:01.367
- You got it!
- Okay.

11:01.467 --> 11:05.133
- [groans]
[bleep]!

11:05.233 --> 11:07.300
Oh, [bleep]!
[groans]

11:07.400 --> 11:11.333
I give being kicked
in the balls...

11:11.433 --> 11:13.967
six stars.

11:14.067 --> 11:15.367
Oh, [bleep].

11:20.767 --> 11:23.367
Giving something six stars
could be a thrilling experience

11:23.467 --> 11:26.933
if done as an expression
of highest approval.

11:27.067 --> 11:30.600
But when done in a system in
which there is no other choice,

11:30.700 --> 11:34.167
it is remarkably
unremarkable.

11:34.267 --> 11:37.800
Giving something six stars:
one star.

11:43.733 --> 11:47.700
[triumphant music]

11:47.800 --> 11:49.933
- Our next review is from
Joaquin Phoenix.

11:50.067 --> 11:51.333
- Oh, you're kidding me!
- Oh, wow!

11:51.433 --> 11:53.733
- Oh!
Oh.

11:53.833 --> 11:56.200
- Hi, I'm Joaquin in Phoenix.

11:56.300 --> 12:00.167
I have to apologize to everyone
at my church this Sunday.

12:00.267 --> 12:02.367
What's it like to speak
in public?

12:02.467 --> 12:06.267
- Oh, well, I guess this is
exactly the moment to confess

12:06.367 --> 12:09.433
that even though I'm a seasoned
and very highly well regarded

12:09.533 --> 12:11.967
television presenter,
I occasionally feel

12:12.067 --> 12:14.300
the terror of stage fright.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.267
- Sometimes I can see
the sweat building

12:15.367 --> 12:17.200
on your upper lip
from over here.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.133
- No, no, for me it's more
of an internal thing.

12:19.233 --> 12:20.300
I don't think it's noticeable.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.800
Okay, well, I am off
to speak publicly!

12:23.900 --> 12:26.933
I have recently learned that my
ex-wife is getting married

12:27.067 --> 12:29.600
to a man that I accidentally
introduced her to.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.900
Suzanne met this man
during my review of catfishing

12:32.067 --> 12:34.633
when I used his annoyingly
perfect face

12:34.733 --> 12:36.133
to communicate with her.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.433
When she wanted to meet me,
I kept up the ruse,

12:38.533 --> 12:41.800
and produced Joe Dale, Jr.,
who, as it turns out,

12:41.900 --> 12:43.233
is a wealthy
professional athlete.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.967
- Hello.
- Soon after,

12:45.067 --> 12:46.167
they started dating.

12:46.267 --> 12:49.133
So he is a fraud,
and she is a dupe.

12:49.233 --> 12:53.300
And not only that,
he cheats on her...all the time.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.200
So, if that doesn't have
the makings

12:55.300 --> 12:58.567
of a memorable wedding speech,
I don't know what does.

12:58.667 --> 13:00.767
I set to work writing a speech
to deliver

13:00.867 --> 13:02.467
at their rehearsal dinner,

13:02.567 --> 13:05.500
one that would completely
derail this wedding of lies.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.333
"Are marrying a stand-in

13:08.433 --> 13:12.433
for the man you really
fell for."

13:12.533 --> 13:14.767
The speech I have written
is a vicious, destructive act

13:14.867 --> 13:17.300
of character assassination.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.267
But that doesn't make it immune
from the number one rule

13:20.367 --> 13:23.133
of public speaking:
I gotta open with a joke.

13:23.233 --> 13:25.800
Now, I remember that my late
father-in-law Jack

13:25.900 --> 13:28.767
opened his toast at our wedding
with a real doozey.

13:28.867 --> 13:32.500
So I've been combing through
the home video of our wedding.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.067
I think I've got it.
Let's see that joke.

13:35.167 --> 13:37.967
- Oh, but I think Forrest
is a little nervous.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.067
Today he asked me
what the wedding night

13:40.100 --> 13:41.800
was gonna be like, and I said,
oh, don't worry,

13:41.900 --> 13:43.133
it's like a candy bar...

13:43.233 --> 13:46.300
- Oh, no, no, don't tell--
- Dad! Dad!

13:46.400 --> 13:49.067
- It's like a candy bar.
Once you take the wrapper off,

13:49.100 --> 13:51.067
the next two minutes
will be heavenly.

13:51.133 --> 13:53.067
[laughter]

13:53.100 --> 13:55.533
Love that joke!
Seriously though,

13:55.633 --> 14:00.800
I love this guy.
He's a little weird sometimes.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.267
I don't always know what he's
talking about, but darn it,

14:03.367 --> 14:06.400
he--he makes my daughter happy,
and that's all

14:06.500 --> 14:08.500
a dad can ask for his kids.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.833
So, Forrest, I want you to
promise that you'll always

14:10.933 --> 14:12.167
keep my little girl happy.

14:12.267 --> 14:15.333
Can you promise me that?
- Yes, I promise.

14:15.433 --> 14:18.867
- Say it again.
- I promise.

14:18.967 --> 14:23.667
- One more time.
- I promise.

14:23.767 --> 14:26.367
- Thank you.
May you two have many children,

14:26.467 --> 14:30.567
who will likely be the first
generation to live in space.

14:30.667 --> 14:33.233
So with that in mind,
let's toast.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.500
- Guest book, huh?

14:38.600 --> 14:41.233
People get to express their
feelings toward the couple.

14:44.867 --> 14:46.233
Let's go.

14:49.300 --> 14:52.600
You know, I'm--I'm hoping
to pass undetected here,

14:52.700 --> 14:53.800
at least till it's time
to give my big--

14:53.900 --> 14:56.233
- Forrest?
- Ah. Oh, hello.

14:56.333 --> 14:58.300
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

14:58.400 --> 14:59.733
I'm just helping to celebrate
the big day.

14:59.833 --> 15:02.367
- You were not invited. It is
inappropriate that you are here.

15:02.467 --> 15:03.500
You're not supposed to be
at rehearsal--

15:03.600 --> 15:04.733
- Hey, Dad!
- Oh, my God, I'm gonna--

15:04.833 --> 15:06.267
- Are you coming to dinner?

15:06.367 --> 15:07.900
- Am I coming to dinner?
Yes, I'm coming to dinner.

15:08.067 --> 15:08.767
Give me a hug.
[laughs]

15:08.867 --> 15:10.933
Ah, you look great.

15:11.067 --> 15:12.267
- Okay, honey, why don't you
go say hi to your aunt?

15:12.367 --> 15:14.067
I'll be right over, okay?
- Okay, sure.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.367
- He is so excited to see me.
That's so sweet, you know?

15:16.467 --> 15:17.667
- Okay, listen to me.

15:17.767 --> 15:19.533
If you stay, I do not want you
to do anything.

15:19.633 --> 15:23.833
Just don't be yourself.
Just be somebody different.

15:29.900 --> 15:30.800
- It was a delightful affair.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.100
Mind if I join you guys?

15:32.200 --> 15:34.633
I was a late addition
to the guest list.

15:34.733 --> 15:37.200
I took my seat and tried
to enjoy the meal.

15:37.300 --> 15:38.833
But I was far too nervous
about my upcoming speech

15:38.933 --> 15:41.067
to eat anything at all.

15:41.167 --> 15:43.833
- What up, everyone?
How you doing?

15:43.933 --> 15:46.433
- As the toasts began
and I readied myself

15:46.533 --> 15:48.567
for my moment in the sun,

15:48.667 --> 15:51.300
I couldn't help but notice
that Suzanne was having

15:51.400 --> 15:53.733
a delightful time
with her soon-to-be husband

15:53.833 --> 15:55.733
and his family.

15:55.833 --> 15:58.600
What if this simple man
could make her happy?

15:58.700 --> 16:01.100
I thought of the promise
I had made to her father

16:01.200 --> 16:04.467
at our wedding, and I put away
my bitter, hateful speech.

16:04.567 --> 16:06.167
- And now I'm gonna turn
the microphone over

16:06.267 --> 16:07.833
to an honored guest.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.200
- Oh, [bleep].

16:09.300 --> 16:10.800
- Oh, a wedding!

16:10.900 --> 16:13.833
Instead, I decided to speak
from the heart.

16:17.733 --> 16:18.933
- I think Joe
is a little nervous here.

16:19.067 --> 16:20.233
He's, uh, asking me about
opening up the wrapper,

16:20.333 --> 16:22.800
and I told him, you know,
that just takes two minutes,

16:22.900 --> 16:26.467
and then we can all have candy.

16:26.567 --> 16:29.367
Or whoever wants it, you know.

16:29.467 --> 16:30.700
I don't--what?
Yeah.

16:30.800 --> 16:34.733
So I had some words prepared
for tonight,

16:34.833 --> 16:37.933
just typical ex-husband stuff,

16:38.067 --> 16:41.800
but, uh, really wanted to say
something more important.

16:41.900 --> 16:45.067
When I married Suzanne,
it was my priority in life

16:45.167 --> 16:50.067
to keep her happy, but I let
other things come first.

16:50.100 --> 16:53.067
I don't know why I did that.
That was stupid.

16:53.133 --> 16:58.800
But, uh, I still feel that it's
my job to keep her happy.

16:58.900 --> 17:02.133
Which is why I have something
that I need to say.

17:02.233 --> 17:06.233
I've been watching you guys
and, uh...

17:06.333 --> 17:08.067
and--and you're happy,
you're really happy.

17:08.100 --> 17:09.133
You're obviously really happy.

17:09.233 --> 17:14.067
So, my mission is accomplished,
basically.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.167
[applause]

17:15.267 --> 17:17.100
Perhaps I should have stopped
there.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.900
Just a second.
Just a minute.

17:19.067 --> 17:24.067
Uh, Joe, I just want to tell Joe
that he's a lucky man...

17:24.100 --> 17:27.133
because you're marrying this
beautiful, beautiful,

17:27.233 --> 17:28.433
beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful woman.

17:28.533 --> 17:30.300
- Thank you, Forrest.
- And just the most patient

17:30.400 --> 17:33.700
and--and intelligent woman
in the whole universe.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.900
But instead I adopted a risky

17:36.067 --> 17:37.833
stream of consciousness
approach.

17:37.933 --> 17:39.667
We have had some times together.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.100
Do you remember Maui?

17:41.200 --> 17:43.400
If you go to Maui, go with
the person that you love most

17:43.500 --> 17:44.600
in your life would be my advice.

17:44.700 --> 17:47.200
That's what I did,
and I went with Suzanne.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.800
Oh, how I felt then!
Like everything in the world

17:50.900 --> 17:53.467
was just gonna be okay forever!

17:53.567 --> 17:56.067
I just want to also mention
that when our beautiful boy Eric

17:56.100 --> 17:57.833
was born, what an incredible
time that was.

17:57.933 --> 17:59.067
- Forrest, that's enough.
- [laughs]

17:59.133 --> 18:00.500
Listen, no,
I just want to say one thing.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.633
One last thing, just, I'll--

18:01.733 --> 18:02.567
- I want you to please
stop talking.

18:02.667 --> 18:03.833
- I'm about to stop talking.

18:03.933 --> 18:05.533
- Please...stop...talking.
- I'm almost done.

18:05.633 --> 18:06.633
Just one more thing I want
to say.

18:06.733 --> 18:07.900
- What I would like you to do...
- Yes?

18:08.067 --> 18:10.367
- Is to stop it.
- And I will.

18:10.467 --> 18:14.667
First, I want to say that...
I made a mistake.

18:14.767 --> 18:17.333
Because I let you feel that you
were not the most important

18:17.433 --> 18:18.967
thing in the world to me,
and that was stupid.

18:19.067 --> 18:20.633
I'm sorry.
And I--

18:20.733 --> 18:23.400
- [sobbing]
- I'm just sorry.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.633
And I just want to tell you
that I miss you...

18:25.733 --> 18:27.067
- Okay.
- And it's very hard to go on

18:27.100 --> 18:30.833
without you, and now I'm gonna
end the speech.

18:30.933 --> 18:33.833
But I'm gonna end it in a way
that I think...

18:33.933 --> 18:35.133
I think you're really gonna
appreciate.

18:35.233 --> 18:37.500
- Okay.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.767
What are you doing? No.
No. Forrest! Oh, my God.

18:39.867 --> 18:42.067
- Suzanne, will you marry--
- Get up!

18:42.167 --> 18:43.633
- Hey, hey, hey!
Let her answer!

18:43.733 --> 18:45.067
Get your hands off me. Idiot.
- That's enough, that's enough.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.867
- Joe: Really? Really, man?
- Forrest: Yeah.

18:46.967 --> 18:49.933
- Please, stop!
Oh, my God. Okay.

18:50.067 --> 18:52.900
- Big, dumb, stupid jerk!
- Oh, my God!

18:53.067 --> 18:55.633
- Words have power
to move people.

18:55.733 --> 18:56.767
Sometimes in positive ways,

18:56.867 --> 19:00.167
and sometimes
in very negative ways.

19:00.267 --> 19:02.967
Public speakers
must be prepared for that.

19:03.067 --> 19:06.100
- Stop it!
- I think he broke my arm!

19:06.200 --> 19:09.533
And they sometimes have to
back up their words with force.

19:09.633 --> 19:11.300
- Oh, my God!
- [roaring]

19:11.400 --> 19:13.667
- He's biting me!
- No! Cut it out!

19:13.767 --> 19:18.067
Cut it out!
- [screaming]

19:18.133 --> 19:21.567
Thanks, everybody,
for all your help.

19:21.667 --> 19:26.533
And when that doesn't work,
there are always more words.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.700
I was catfishing you, Suzanne.

19:28.800 --> 19:29.967
- What?
- Shut up, man.

19:30.067 --> 19:31.200
- You shut up.
- Shut up.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.167
- I was catfishing you,
that was me on MeFindYou.com

19:33.267 --> 19:34.400
that you were talking to.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.367
- What are you talking about?
- That was me,

19:35.467 --> 19:36.333
and I hired him to help me
fool you.

19:36.433 --> 19:37.700
- Will you shut up?
- What? Joe?

19:37.800 --> 19:38.933
- That was me
you were talking to!

19:39.067 --> 19:40.967
It was me that you fell
in love with.

19:41.067 --> 19:43.067
Remember, remember when you were
talking to Ace Shrift?

19:43.167 --> 19:44.133
I was Ace Shrift,
and you were talking about...

19:44.233 --> 19:46.833
- Joe.
- The spatial layout of Costco.

19:46.933 --> 19:48.867
Who's gonna walk right in
and buy a TV?

19:48.967 --> 19:50.100
I said that!

19:50.200 --> 19:51.267
- I feel that way too
about Costco!

19:51.367 --> 19:54.067
- He's a liar and a fraud!
- You shut up!

19:54.100 --> 19:56.233
- You shut up!
- What is going on?

19:56.333 --> 19:57.933
Who was talking to me online?

19:58.067 --> 20:00.000
- He is just a guy
that puts on

20:00.100 --> 20:01.967
a little boy suit and runs
really fast and catches a ball

20:02.067 --> 20:04.700
real good, and sleeps
with women constantly!

20:04.800 --> 20:05.967
- Oh, yeah, right!
- What?

20:06.067 --> 20:08.167
- He is constantly cheating
on you, constantly!

20:08.267 --> 20:10.000
Every city he goes to, sleeping
with baseball groupie whores!

20:10.100 --> 20:13.233
- No, it's not--
- Who are you? What is going on?

20:13.333 --> 20:16.000
I do not want to talk
about this anymore!

20:16.100 --> 20:16.833
- Suzanne, Suzanne!
- Get away from me!

20:16.933 --> 20:18.767
- He's a fraud and a liar!

20:18.867 --> 20:20.033
- I will end you!

20:20.133 --> 20:22.367
Suzanne, Suzanne, listen!
Suzanne, come on!

20:22.467 --> 20:25.200
Hey! Hey!

20:28.133 --> 20:31.100
- There is no such thing
as the perfect speech.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.667
Something will always go wrong.

20:33.767 --> 20:36.133
But at the same time,
public speaking allows us

20:36.233 --> 20:38.500
the opportunity to share
essential truths

20:38.600 --> 20:41.933
with the people who need
to hear them most.

20:42.033 --> 20:46.867
I give it 4 1/2 stars.

20:46.967 --> 20:47.867
- Aren't you gonna tell us
what happened

20:47.967 --> 20:49.267
between Suzanne
and Joe Dale, Jr.?

20:49.367 --> 20:53.300
- Oh, yeah, well, Suzanne has
not been returning my calls,

20:53.400 --> 20:55.167
but I have learned
through the grapevine

20:55.267 --> 20:57.700
that their wedding
was called off.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.100
- Oh.
- That's a--

20:59.200 --> 21:00.433
that's a terrible shame.

21:00.533 --> 21:02.233
That's all the time we have left
for today.

21:02.333 --> 21:04.567
Please tune in next time for
more of what life has to offer.

21:04.667 --> 21:08.333
- Bye!
- Bye.

21:11.533 --> 21:12.067
- Extra cheese!

21:16.300 --> 21:17.733
- Joe is a little nervous
about how long

21:17.833 --> 21:19.333
it's gonna take him
to eat that candy bar.

21:19.433 --> 21:20.533
I told him it's just gonna be
a couple minutes.

21:20.633 --> 21:23.300
With the r--

21:23.400 --> 21:24.667
- Please don't do it
a third time.

21:24.767 --> 21:28.067
- I think Joe--Joe seems
nervous about eating his candy

21:28.133 --> 21:28.867
tonight, on his wedding night.
