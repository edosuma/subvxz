01:00.200 --> 01:01.959
What's taking this guy so long?

01:01.960 --> 01:03.879
Is he really as good as they say he is?

01:03.880 --> 01:06.087
No. Better.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.439
Oh. yeah!

01:08.440 --> 01:10.602
Whoa! Who was that?

01:12.560 --> 01:15.959
Why, hello, ladies.
Are you ready to lose?

01:15.960 --> 01:18.199
Last one to the water tower
buys a round of fuel.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.519
Tell you what,
I'll give you guys a head start.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.719
- You're going to need it.
- Later, loser.

01:23.720 --> 01:27.486
One one-thousand, two one...
Oh, that's enough.

01:50.680 --> 01:52.205
See ya, suckers!

01:52.480 --> 01:53.527
Eat my...

01:53.880 --> 01:55.450
- Dusty!
- Oh! Aw...

01:58.280 --> 02:00.719
Pay attention.
You're daydreaming again.

02:00.720 --> 02:04.079
Me? No, no, no! No.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.199
Okay, yes.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.202
But, you know, come on, Leadbottom.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.239
Really? How hard is this?

02:09.240 --> 02:11.561
Fly straight, turn around.
Fly straight, turn around.

02:11.720 --> 02:15.042
Are you disrespecting
the sweet science of aerial application?

02:15.200 --> 02:17.043
Look, I am more than just a crop duster.

02:17.240 --> 02:19.208
Don't go flap-jawing

02:19.400 --> 02:21.919
about that Flings Around the Planet
air racing nonsense again.

02:21.920 --> 02:25.163
Excuse me, it is called
the Wings Around the Globe Rally.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.651
For the love of Peterbilt!

02:26.760 --> 02:29.127
And it's not nonsense.
I've got a tight turn radius

02:29.360 --> 02:30.639
and a high power-to-weight ratio.

02:30.640 --> 02:31.721
- You know what else you got?
- What?

02:31.960 --> 02:33.121
A screw loose!

02:33.240 --> 02:35.242
I mean, why would you
want to give up crop-dusting?

02:35.560 --> 02:41.203
Blue skies, no air traffic,
and that tangy scent of Vita-minamulch.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.560
Mmm.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.768
Just like Momma used to spray.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.119
Delicious.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.930
They say the sense of smell
is the first thing to go.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.082
- You smell it?
- Quitting time!

02:51.840 --> 02:54.161
A crop duster wanting to be a racer.

02:54.480 --> 02:57.450
If you ask me, more racers
should want to be crop dusters.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.843
<i>I got some minamulch, yeah!
Minamulch</i>

03:16.480 --> 03:20.405
Yuck. Nowadays, they got soybean fuel,
switchgrass fuel, algae fuel. Come on!

03:20.520 --> 03:22.479
- Oh, healthy! No tank you.
- Tell me about it.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.679
- What's next, pistachio propane?
- What, are you nuts?

03:24.680 --> 03:27.439
For my money, there's nothing like
good old-fashioned corn fuel.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.522
- Oh, yeah, you betcha.
- I even made up a slogan.

03:29.720 --> 03:30.960
Oh, slogans are good.

03:31.120 --> 03:34.806
"Corn. it gives you gas."

03:37.000 --> 03:39.048
Catchy. I like that.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.521
Me, too. There you go, Sparky,
you're all set.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.330
- Catch you later, Chug.
- Sure thing.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.847
<i>This is
Dusty Crophopper to Chug. Over.</i>

03:46.520 --> 03:49.759
Uh, Chug isn't here.
Come on, use the new call sign.

03:49.760 --> 03:50.799
<i>Right, right, right.</i>

03:50.800 --> 03:54.719
<i>This is, uh, Strut Jetstream
calling Turbo Coach Truck-zilla.</i>

03:54.720 --> 03:57.724
<i>- Ready for practice?</i>
- You betcha, Strut.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.321
Ha-ha! Whoo!

04:04.000 --> 04:05.359
Young punk.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.199
All right, buddy,
I got you in sight.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.168
Now let's start with
some corn-row sprints.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.049
<i>Drop and give me 20!</i>

04:19.160 --> 04:20.844
<i>Come on, buddy, keep it going!</i>

04:21.000 --> 04:22.490
<i>- Ooh, nice turn.</i>
- What else you got?

04:22.640 --> 04:24.449
Okay. Now, let's try
some treeline moguls.

04:24.600 --> 04:25.840
Yeah!

04:26.360 --> 04:28.442
<i>All the way up and down.</i>

04:28.640 --> 04:29.679
<i>Don't be dogging it.</i>

04:29.680 --> 04:30.839
<i>- That's how you do it.</i>
- Ooh, yeah!

04:30.840 --> 04:32.444
<i>- Looking good!</i>
- Uh-huh.

04:32.680 --> 04:36.446
Okay, adjust your angle of bank
with your alien irons!

04:36.880 --> 04:39.804
- You mean "ailerons"?
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

04:40.040 --> 04:41.690
Oh, great.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.919
Oil lines and oil cooler
check out.

04:43.920 --> 04:44.921
Mmm-hmm.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.651
- AN-8 fittings look fine.
- Nice.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.370
Wait a minute.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.046
You've worn out your main oil-seal.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.719
Huh. Really?

04:53.720 --> 04:55.879
That kind of damage comes from
extremely high speeds.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.319
Hey!

04:57.320 --> 05:01.239
Pushing the engine to the red line
for prolonged periods of time.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.559
- That would be unwise.
- But that's not you.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.769
You're a crop duster
and all you do is just dust crops

05:06.920 --> 05:09.969
- at very low speeds.
- Yep, low and slow.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.851
Unless you've been racing again!

05:13.240 --> 05:15.971
No! What, me? No.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.328
Oh, man, Duster, you were in the zone,

05:18.520 --> 05:20.249
where a Saturn rocket
couldn't catch you!

05:20.400 --> 05:21.479
Ballistic!

05:21.480 --> 05:23.562
We're talking light speed.
Light speed, here!

05:23.760 --> 05:27.845
You're going to tear it up
at the qualifier this weekend.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.404
Yea... Oh, Shelby.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.768
Um... I don't know.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.487
Dusty, you're not built to race.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.483
You're built to dust crops.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.079
Do you know what will happen
if you push it too far?

05:40.080 --> 05:43.004
Wing flutter,
metal fatigue, turbine failure.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.771
Turbine failure?
Oh, no, I'm going down!

05:46.520 --> 05:49.285
Why didn't I listen to Dottie?

05:49.440 --> 05:50.930
Yeah, why don't you listen to Dottie?

05:51.160 --> 05:52.959
She's the smartest mechanic
in the world!

05:52.960 --> 05:54.041
- Oh, my gosh!
- What?

05:54.240 --> 05:55.730
- The orphanage!
- No.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.001
- Not the orphanage!
- Kids, out of the way!

05:57.120 --> 05:58.360
Kaboom!

05:59.040 --> 06:01.486
The kids!

06:06.520 --> 06:10.359
Wow! That was vivid and specific.

06:10.360 --> 06:13.648
And exactly why I need you
to come with us to the qualifier.

06:13.800 --> 06:14.801
You're unbelievable.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.167
Oh. Did you hear that? I'm unbelievable.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.482
The orphans!

06:22.680 --> 06:25.684
<i>Tune in, in two weeks for the start of
the Wings Around the Globe.</i>

06:26.360 --> 06:28.359
You know, I think we've got
a really good shot at this, buddy.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.966
Oh, yeah! Especially
if I finish this book by then.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.651
Oh! I love this show!

06:33.040 --> 06:35.691
<i>The 10 best
air crashes of all time!</i>

06:35.800 --> 06:37.159
- Whoa! Oh.
- Not good.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.321
How does that happen?

06:42.320 --> 06:44.039
That is not going to buff out.

06:44.040 --> 06:48.489
You know, this might not cover
everything you could run into out there.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.479
- What are you getting at?
- I don't know.

06:50.480 --> 06:54.159
I'm just wondering if maybe
we need, uh, some help.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.359
Help? From who?

06:55.360 --> 06:57.283
Oh, well, like the Skipper.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.281
That old Corsair
down at the end of the runway?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.599
- Sure, he's a war hero.
- He's an old crankshaft.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.170
My buddy, Sparky, says the Skipper

07:03.360 --> 07:06.039
was a legendary
flight instructor in the navy.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.839
That's right. He knows stuff.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.171
He's been grounded for decades.

07:09.280 --> 07:12.039
Why would I want to be coached
by a plane who doesn't even fly?

07:12.040 --> 07:13.759
At least he's a plane.

07:13.760 --> 07:16.519
<i>The number one crash
of all time...</i>

07:16.520 --> 07:17.679
Oh, man!

07:17.680 --> 07:18.727
<i>I'm okay.</i>

07:20.680 --> 07:22.921
<i>Ooh! That's got to hurt.</i>

07:29.200 --> 07:31.726
They say
he shot down 50 planes.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.168
I heard stories about his squadron,
the Jolly Wrenches.

07:35.480 --> 07:36.481
Mmm-hmm.

07:36.600 --> 07:40.047
They were the roughest, toughest,
meanest flyers in the navy.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.931
Ruthless killers who showed no mercy.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.168
- Uh, wait, so...
- No mercy!

07:45.800 --> 07:48.770
They would shoot you
as soon as look at you.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.440
I hope you're right about this.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.401
Chug!

07:53.800 --> 07:54.926
I'll wait here.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.571
Uh...

08:04.640 --> 08:06.927
Hey, there, Skipper.

08:07.080 --> 08:11.165
Say, I'm trying out for
the Wings Around the Globe Rally.

08:11.320 --> 08:14.483
And I know you can't fly anymore,

08:14.680 --> 08:19.766
but, you know, they say,
"Those who can't do, teach."

08:19.920 --> 08:21.968
So...

08:22.080 --> 08:25.319
Okay, what I mean to say is,
you're not a truck.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.802
So, I was wondering
if you would train me?

08:32.600 --> 08:35.331
Go on, he's warming up to you.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.405
So, I heard you shot down 50 planes.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.364
You looking to be number 51?

08:42.520 --> 08:44.443
Uh... No.

08:44.640 --> 08:45.801
No, no, no! Wait, wait.

08:45.920 --> 08:49.039
I just... I figured,
with my guts and your glory...

08:49.040 --> 08:52.487
Your guts would be a grease spot
on a runway somewhere.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.959
Go home. You're in over your head, kid.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.849
Look, you flew all those...

09:01.640 --> 09:03.961
Let's try the back door.

09:10.640 --> 09:14.008
- Hello, Lincoln!
- Hey, Dusty!

09:14.880 --> 09:17.639
I don't know how
you talked me into coming to this.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.799
Now, come on, Dottie.

09:18.800 --> 09:22.719
Wow! I don't believe it. A Red Tail P-51!

09:22.720 --> 09:24.802
Oh, man! A Sea Fury!

09:25.480 --> 09:27.482
Check it out!

09:28.720 --> 09:29.721
Wow!

09:30.720 --> 09:33.041
<i>Ladies and gentleplanes.</i>

09:33.160 --> 09:35.208
<i>May we have your attention, please?</i>

09:35.360 --> 09:37.840
<i>Kindly direct your windscreens
to the heavens above</i>

09:38.080 --> 09:41.323
<i>and give a warm welcome
to our special guest.</i>

09:41.480 --> 09:43.599
<i>The Prince of Propellers.</i>

09:43.600 --> 09:45.523
<i>When he's speeding, he's leading.</i>

09:45.720 --> 09:47.165
Get my good side, fellas.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.365
<i>When he's grinning, he's winning.</i>

09:52.520 --> 09:54.921
<i>The one and only</i>

09:55.080 --> 09:57.526
Ripslinger!

09:58.560 --> 10:00.688
You're caught in the riptide!

10:00.840 --> 10:02.719
Thanks for coming out.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.119
Who wants a picture?
All right, one at a time.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.090
Well, with all that self-promotion,
at least he's modest.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.368
Dottie, that's Ripslinger.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.444
He's captain of Team RPX.
They call him...

10:13.600 --> 10:15.443
The Green Tornado.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.251
Oh, he's so good, he's pre-qualified.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.204
Oh. And those two, Ned and Zed.

10:20.640 --> 10:21.641
The Twin Turbos.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.091
They're world-class racers.

10:23.240 --> 10:28.121
You know, I hear they used to be
one plane and were separated at birth.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.489
Wow. I wish I was separated at birth.

10:31.880 --> 10:32.959
<i>Okay, people.</i>

10:32.960 --> 10:36.039
<i>This is the last of four time trials
being held worldwide.</i>

10:36.040 --> 10:39.123
<i>Today's qualifying round
is one lap around the pylons.</i>

10:39.720 --> 10:44.282
<i>The top five finishers will qualify
for the Wings Around the Globe Rally.</i>

10:44.400 --> 10:45.481
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

10:45.640 --> 10:47.439
<i>Fonzarelli, you're up, my man.</i>

10:48.720 --> 10:50.768
<i>Oh, man! That's nasty.</i>

10:54.920 --> 10:57.161
<i>And he's through the start gate!</i>

10:57.320 --> 10:59.766
<i>The racers must pass through
the blue pylons on the horizontal</i>

10:59.920 --> 11:02.287
<i>and around the red pylons
on the knife-edge.</i>

11:03.160 --> 11:05.239
<i>Now he's coming back to Gate Three!</i>

11:05.240 --> 11:06.919
<i>Nicely done, my man.</i>

11:06.920 --> 11:10.239
<i>Setting himself up a little high
through the blue pylons there,</i>

11:10.240 --> 11:11.241
<i>lining up for the quadro.</i>

11:11.440 --> 11:14.842
<i>He's taking a hard right with a
270-degree high-G turn! Yeah!</i>

11:15.000 --> 11:16.923
<i>Back all the way around. Whoo!</i>

11:17.080 --> 11:20.129
<i>- Cleanly through. Ha! Look at you, man!</i>
- That guy's good.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.767
<i>It doesn't get much better than that.
All right. Good speed.</i>

11:22.920 --> 11:25.924
<i>Lining up for the three-pylon chicane,
amazing pitch control.</i>

11:26.120 --> 11:27.884
<i>Smooth! Fast! Clean!</i>

11:28.240 --> 11:29.480
<i>He's going into the final turn,</i>

11:29.600 --> 11:32.649
<i>into the half-Cuban 8,
pulling an aggressive 9.2 Gs.</i>

11:32.800 --> 11:34.450
<i>Attacking the climb!</i>

11:34.600 --> 11:35.931
<i>Wow. Now that's some speed.</i>

11:36.360 --> 11:39.999
<i>Coming out of the Cuban 8 at
the end of a fantastic first run, people.</i>

11:40.000 --> 11:41.240
<i>A 01.24.16.</i>

11:42.080 --> 11:44.321
<i>A very good time for
the other racers to try and beat.</i>

11:45.320 --> 11:47.288
<i>Fast, tight through the pylons.</i>

11:47.440 --> 11:48.965
<i>He's got a great pace going, here.</i>

11:49.160 --> 11:50.719
<i>He's just a half a second behind.</i>

11:50.720 --> 11:52.484
<i>- Oh! Engine failure!</i>
- Oh!

11:52.640 --> 11:54.085
<i>Out of the race. Bye-bye.</i>

11:54.400 --> 11:55.686
<i>Great performance.
Watch the clock here.</i>

11:55.960 --> 11:57.644
<i>I can't wait. Lining up for the Blue Gate.</i>

11:57.800 --> 12:00.007
<i>Oh, no, he did not!
That's a major penalty.</i>

12:00.280 --> 12:02.319
<i>Sony, dude. Eighth place.</i>

12:02.320 --> 12:03.810
<i>Talk about fast.</i>

12:03.960 --> 12:06.247
<i>Coming out the Cuban 8.</i>

12:07.200 --> 12:08.645
Fueled and ready, man.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.643
Okay, bud, you're up.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.211
Good and tight.

12:12.320 --> 12:13.639
- All set.
<i>- It's been a wonderful day here,</i>

12:13.640 --> 12:15.051
<i>and we're down to our last competitor.</i>

12:15.160 --> 12:16.571
This is it.

12:17.560 --> 12:21.167
<i>From Propwash Junction,
Strut Jetstream.</i>

12:21.480 --> 12:23.039
"Strut Jetstream"?

12:23.040 --> 12:27.039
Yep. Awesomest call sign ever.
It was my idea.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.247
- Ah. That explains it.
<i>- Hey, ag-plane!</i>

12:29.680 --> 12:33.730
<i>Landscaping was yesterday, man.
Get off the runway. We're racing, here.</i>

12:33.840 --> 12:35.959
<i>- Second call for Strut Jetstream.</i>
- No, no, no!

12:35.960 --> 12:38.679
<i>- Looking for...</i>
- Yo! I'm Strut Jetstream.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.079
<i>- You are Strut Jetstream?</i>
- Yep.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.681
<i>A crop duster?
Man, what's going on here?</i>

12:42.560 --> 12:43.679
<i>Is everybody getting to fly today?</i>

12:43.680 --> 12:45.887
<i>Man, your momma must have
had high hopes for you.</i>

12:46.200 --> 12:48.328
<i>Now, you know you are
built for seed, not speed.</i>

12:48.480 --> 12:49.686
You have got to be kidding me.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.359
That farmer's going to race?

12:51.360 --> 12:53.567
Seriously, with a prop that small?

12:53.720 --> 12:55.210
Maybe he races that leaky,

12:55.720 --> 12:56.839
old fuel truck next to him.

12:56.840 --> 12:57.966
Who are you calling leaky?

12:58.120 --> 13:00.088
I'll leak on you,
if you don't check your intake.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.199
Don't lower yourself to their level.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.601
Go on Dus...
Go on, Strut.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.531
Who's that guy?

13:06.720 --> 13:08.400
- You're going to try out?
- A crop duster?

13:08.520 --> 13:10.000
Cornfield is over that way.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.122
Nice of you to take the day off
just to lose!

13:15.720 --> 13:16.960
Go, Duster!

13:17.280 --> 13:20.489
<i>It's going to be a tall order for him
to knock Fonzarelli out of fifth place.</i>

13:21.920 --> 13:23.126
<i>And he's off!</i>

13:23.360 --> 13:24.361
<i>Well, he's starting a little conservative.</i>

13:24.480 --> 13:25.559
This ought to be rich.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.881
<i>193 miles per hour.</i>

13:28.200 --> 13:30.680
<i>He's into Gate Two,
clean through the horizontal.</i>

13:30.880 --> 13:33.565
<i>What?
He's practically mowing the lawn.</i>

13:33.720 --> 13:34.721
<i>Come to my house, man.</i>

13:36.000 --> 13:37.599
<i>Okay. At the first split,
he's a full second behind Fonzarelli.</i>

13:37.600 --> 13:40.439
<i>Yo, that's a lot of time to make up,
but this guy's aggressive.</i>

13:40.440 --> 13:42.886
<i>Now he's making that hard
270-degree high-G turn!</i>

13:43.080 --> 13:44.279
Whoo! That's it!

13:44.280 --> 13:45.919
<i>Setting himself up. Left vertical turn.</i>

13:45.920 --> 13:47.843
<i>Lining up for the three-pylon chicane.</i>

13:48.000 --> 13:49.159
<i>He's gaining speed.</i>

13:49.160 --> 13:51.242
<i>Now, he's only half a second
behind Fonzarelli.</i>

13:51.640 --> 13:52.721
<i>And he is closing rapidly.</i>

13:54.080 --> 13:56.924
<i>Now he's back on that stick.
Up he goes! Up and away!</i>

13:57.560 --> 13:58.800
<i>Now only two-tenths of
a second behind Fonzarelli!</i>

13:58.960 --> 14:01.079
- Come on, Duster!
<i>- Oh, it's going to be close.</i>

14:01.080 --> 14:02.764
He's going to do it. He's going to do it.

14:02.920 --> 14:06.242
<i>Oh, yes! What a finish!
Now, that's what you call flying!</i>

14:06.440 --> 14:08.090
Way to go, Dustmeister.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.330
That's what I'm talking about.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.807
<i>Jetstream, the official time is</i>

14:12.960 --> 14:16.442
<i>1 minute, 24.26 seconds.</i>

14:16.600 --> 14:20.321
<i>Sixth place,
but what a close one, people.</i>

14:20.480 --> 14:23.479
<i>Well, folks, that wraps up the trials
for the Wings Around the Globe Rally.</i>

14:23.480 --> 14:26.882
Hey, pal, sixth place
ain't nothing to be ashamed of.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.724
That was a heck of a run.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.360
Thanks.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.411
Ow! Dagnabbit! Let me drive!

15:00.560 --> 15:03.086
There you go, topped off
and all set, Mayday.

15:03.240 --> 15:06.084
Will you stop! Unbelievable!

15:06.240 --> 15:07.319
Why don't you just go back!

15:07.320 --> 15:09.322
I mean, I think you actually
missed a pothole!

15:10.160 --> 15:11.879
Man, you got to be the worst,

15:11.880 --> 15:14.521
I mean the worst delivery truck
that has ever delivered a delivery!

15:14.840 --> 15:16.126
Can I help you?

15:17.440 --> 15:18.999
Please tell me
this is Propwash Junction.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.119
Sure is.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.090
Oh, finally. You know,
you're not even on the map.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.163
Yeah, pretty drive though, ain't it?

15:25.440 --> 15:27.719
Oh, yeah. Especially if you
like looking at dirt and corn.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.690
Anyway,
I'm looking for a Strut Jetstream.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.810
- Who?
- Jetstream. Strut Jetstream.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.401
Nope, doesn't ring a bell.
Do you have a photo?

15:36.640 --> 15:38.679
Yeah, I got one right here.
No, I don't have a photo!

15:38.680 --> 15:39.879
I have documentation that says

15:39.880 --> 15:42.451
Strut Jetstream
lives in Propwash Junction.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.807
Oh, whoa, whoa! Whoa,
wait a minute! Okay! Oh...

15:46.000 --> 15:47.445
No, gosh I...

15:47.600 --> 15:49.364
Hey, I'm Strut Jetstream.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.079
Yeah! That's right!

15:52.080 --> 15:55.084
I knew I'd remember.
There he is, strutting on over here.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.811
But you're mispronouncing it slightly.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.200
- I am?
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

15:59.360 --> 16:03.081
It's actually pronounced
"Dusty Crophopper."

16:05.400 --> 16:07.528
Dusty Crophopper.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.201
Yeah. It's Scandinavian.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.759
Right, and I'm Egyptian.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.679
Googly moogly!
What is that smell?

16:15.680 --> 16:17.719
- It's Vita-minamulch.
- Vita-mina-what?

16:17.720 --> 16:20.519
The finest-smelling compost
this side of the Mississippi.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.719
Original, creamy and chunky style.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.122
Oh, yeah.
Smell that? It's like daffodils

16:27.080 --> 16:29.401
and like Sunday dinner.
I just love it. I love it.

16:29.560 --> 16:33.929
<i>I got some minamulch, yeah!
I got some minamulch, yeah!</i>

16:34.080 --> 16:36.439
That old airplane needs some help.
Y'all know that, right?

16:36.440 --> 16:37.601
Yeah.

16:37.760 --> 16:40.239
Are you familiar with
the racing fuel additive, nitro methane?

16:40.240 --> 16:42.639
Oh, yeah! Zip juice! Go-go punch!

16:42.640 --> 16:44.919
That stuff will blur your vision
and slur your speech.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.159
- It's illegal.
- Totally illegal.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.599
Wouldn't know what it looks like.
Yeah, you were saying?

16:48.600 --> 16:52.559
That substance was found in the tank
of the fifth-place qualifier, Fonzarelli.

16:52.560 --> 16:55.040
Illegal fuel intake is an automatic DQ.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.442
Wait, so you're saying...

16:57.640 --> 17:00.371
He's out, you're in. Congratulations.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.930
- You're in?
- Hmm.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.079
He's in!

17:06.079 --> 17:07.923
You're never going to believe this.
He's in!

17:08.079 --> 17:10.367
Dusty's in the race! Dottie, he's in!

17:10.520 --> 17:12.089
What? Are you serious?

17:12.240 --> 17:13.398
Whoo! Dusty.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.159
Don't do anything crazy.
Fly safe.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.479
Man, it's going to be cool.

17:16.480 --> 17:19.086
You're going to cross oceans
thousands of miles wide.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.083
Freezing your rudder off one day...

17:21.240 --> 17:23.321
- And burning it off the next!
- Freaking hurricanes.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.719
- Cyclones!
- Typhoons!

17:24.720 --> 17:26.319
- Monsoons!
- Tornadoes!

17:26.319 --> 17:27.959
- Sandstorms!
- Gale force winds!

17:27.960 --> 17:29.200
Yeah!

17:33.040 --> 17:34.326
Hmm.

17:35.600 --> 17:36.965
Bad idea.

17:37.960 --> 17:40.964
You'll end up a smoking hole
on the side of a mountain

17:41.080 --> 17:43.119
with your parts
spread over five countries.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.326
What makes you say that?

17:44.520 --> 17:46.879
You're going up against
the best racers in the world.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.530
And some of them don't even finish.

17:48.680 --> 17:49.966
You're sloppy on your rolls,

17:50.160 --> 17:52.322
wide on your turns,
slow on your straightaways.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.639
You've been watching me?

17:54.640 --> 17:56.529
Yeah, watching you
make a fool out of yourself.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.759
You need to be tighter getting
in and out of your knife-edge.

17:58.760 --> 17:59.839
Okay.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.279
Any extra control input
costs you speed and seconds.

18:02.280 --> 18:06.569
- So, you think I'm overcorrecting?
- Absolutely. Rookie mistake.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.370
Are you giving me pointers?

18:08.560 --> 18:11.370
No! I'm telling you to forget
all this racing malarkey.

18:11.520 --> 18:14.091
You just ain't built for it.
You're a crop duster!

18:14.280 --> 18:17.727
You don't think I know that?

18:17.880 --> 18:20.087
I'm the one who's been
flying back and forth

18:20.200 --> 18:25.650
across the same fields day after day,
month after month, for years!

18:25.800 --> 18:30.408
I have flown thousands of miles

18:30.600 --> 18:32.439
and I have never been anywhere.

18:32.440 --> 18:33.487
Not like you.

18:34.120 --> 18:37.442
You were built to fight,
and look what you did!

18:37.920 --> 18:39.604
You're a hero.

18:40.960 --> 18:45.239
I'm just trying to prove
that maybe, just maybe,

18:45.240 --> 18:47.971
I can do more than what I was built for.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.409
You know what? Just forget it.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.088
You'll never understand.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.206
0500, tomorrow. Don't be late.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.203
Wait. 0500?

19:04.360 --> 19:07.762
Yeah, 5:00 a.m.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.483
Sparky, binoculars.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.688
Those are some
mighty clean optics, there.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.279
What do you use?
Some kind of shammy?

19:20.280 --> 19:22.759
- Oh, no, it's a special microfiber cloth.
- Ah. Microfiber.

19:22.760 --> 19:25.439
Yeah, lint-free, scratch-free.
I'll get you some.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.920
I got an ex-Navy buddy
who sells them to me wholesale.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.081
I helped him set up his web...

19:29.240 --> 19:31.641
Knock it off. We got a lot of work to do.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.088
I'll hook you up.
Thanks.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.521
All right, Dusty, remember this.

19:36.640 --> 19:39.086
It ain't how fast you fly,
it's how you fly fast.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.601
- Roger that.
<i>- Show me what you got.</i>

19:41.840 --> 19:45.128
Watch this! Oh, yeah.

19:45.240 --> 19:48.449
<i>Great, you can
go up and down. What else?</i>

19:48.640 --> 19:50.005
<i>- Show me your turns.</i>
- Here we go!

19:51.960 --> 19:55.885
<i>You think that was good? That stunk!
Knife-edge those elm trees.</i>

19:56.160 --> 19:57.969
Oh, come on. Keep your nose up!

19:58.120 --> 19:59.963
Hey, Skip.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.799
- You want speed, right?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

20:01.800 --> 20:03.959
- Serious, bolt-rattling speed?
- Oh, yeah!

20:03.960 --> 20:06.122
<i>Then look up.
Do you see those clouds?</i>

20:06.280 --> 20:07.850
<i>The highway in the sky.</i>

20:08.000 --> 20:10.844
<i>Tailwinds like nothing
you've ever flown.</i>

20:11.000 --> 20:12.843
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

20:13.080 --> 20:15.128
<i>Come on, power up. Firewall thrust.</i>

20:15.280 --> 20:17.123
<i>Max torque, max torque!</i>

20:17.280 --> 20:18.645
<i>All right, looking good.</i>

20:18.840 --> 20:20.922
<i>Hold V-Y, Dusty. Max rate, now.</i>

20:21.520 --> 20:24.171
<i>Your nose is too high.
Get your nose down.</i>

20:24.760 --> 20:28.128
<i>You're going to stall.
Ease off the pitch. Nose down!</i>

20:28.320 --> 20:29.321
Oh!

20:30.040 --> 20:32.805
Hey, what are you doing?

20:38.640 --> 20:40.688
What just happened up there?

20:40.880 --> 20:42.484
I'm... I'm low on fuel.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.926
Do I look like I was built yesterday?

20:44.080 --> 20:47.926
- No, no. It's a long story.
- I got time.

20:48.600 --> 20:49.679
Uh...

20:49.680 --> 20:51.199
Okay, well, um, you know,

20:51.200 --> 20:54.044
I feel like I was having some problems
with my axial compressor so...

20:54.360 --> 20:57.159
The Jolly Wrenches have a motto,
<i>Volo Pro Veritas.</i>

20:57.160 --> 20:59.686
It means "I fly for truth."

21:00.160 --> 21:02.845
Clearly, you don't.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.201
Sparky, push me back to the hangar.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.649
I'm afraid of heights.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.410
- But you're a plane.
- I'm a crop duster.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.727
I've never flown over a thousand feet.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.479
Are you kidding?

21:26.480 --> 21:29.484
Scared of heights and you want to
race around the world?

21:29.680 --> 21:32.365
Uh, Skip, during the attack
of Tujunga Harbor,

21:32.560 --> 21:35.040
why, even the P-38s
had trouble at high altitudes.

21:35.200 --> 21:38.170
Well, they didn't have to fly
over the Himalayas, did they?

21:38.400 --> 21:40.880
I'll still be low to the ground,
just high up.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.560
And after the war,
those 38s went on to win races.

21:43.760 --> 21:44.886
Really? Is that true?

21:45.080 --> 21:47.399
Yeah, true.
Like in the Cleveland race of '46.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.209
- For real?
- Wait, it gets better.

21:49.360 --> 21:53.206
In '49, the P-38 Sky Ranger
averaged 337 miles per hour.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.441
Wait, 337?

21:54.600 --> 21:57.604
Well, actually 337.4, but they
round it down in the record books.

21:57.720 --> 21:58.767
Why would you do that?

21:58.920 --> 22:00.251
Some people just have
no respect for decimal points.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.719
- Yeah, I know. Tell me about it.
- Why couldn't they round it up?

22:02.720 --> 22:05.246
- Seriously, he...
- All right, all right.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.443
So, you're a flat-hatter.
We'll work on that.

22:08.600 --> 22:12.321
But for now let's see if we can turn
low and sloppy into low and fast.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.931
Roger that.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.200
It'll go like this.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.719
<i>The flag marks the start line.</i>

22:19.720 --> 22:22.239
<i>Across the cornfield,
three silos are waiting for you.</i>

22:22.240 --> 22:23.759
<i>Slalom those with a radial-G pass.</i>

22:23.760 --> 22:25.079
<i>Wait. "A radial" what pass?</i>

22:25.080 --> 22:26.161
<i>Once you get to the trees,</i>

22:26.280 --> 22:28.919
<i>go to your optimal rate of climb
to about 500 feet.</i>

22:28.920 --> 22:31.969
<i>Roll inverted and extend,
trading altitude for air speed</i>

22:32.120 --> 22:34.519
<i>- and dive toward the finish line.</i>
- Uh, okay.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.279
You string all that together,
you might have a chance to beat him.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.281
Who am I racing?

22:39.000 --> 22:40.159
Here he comes.

22:40.160 --> 22:43.130
He's a twin commuter
pushing about 1500 horsepower.

22:43.680 --> 22:44.920
<i>Uh, he's pretty high up.</i>

22:45.080 --> 22:48.129
<i>You're not racing him,
you're racing his shadow.</i>

22:48.320 --> 22:49.446
<i>Beat it to the water tower.</i>

22:50.800 --> 22:52.768
<i>Let's do this! Thread the silos!</i>

22:53.280 --> 22:56.523
<i>Tighter! Lean into your turns more.</i>

22:57.280 --> 22:58.884
- His turns are terrible.
- Yeah.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.531
<i>Let's go, Dusty. Faster.</i>

23:01.920 --> 23:03.081
You're falling behind.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.527
<i>Begin your climb
and catch him in the dive.</i>

23:05.680 --> 23:07.808
<i>Start your dive now.</i>

23:07.960 --> 23:10.122
Never mind, you already lost.

23:12.800 --> 23:17.647
So, we can increase power
or we can decrease drag.

23:18.320 --> 23:21.051
Definitely increase power.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.485
More torque means more speed.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.211
Lousy.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.522
<i>Come on, let's work that radial-G turn.</i>

23:32.720 --> 23:35.166
<i>Do it again. One more time. Again!</i>

23:35.960 --> 23:38.281
<i>Come on! Push it, Dusty!</i>

23:39.920 --> 23:40.921
Better!

23:41.080 --> 23:42.684
Remember now, altitude for airspeed.

23:42.840 --> 23:43.841
Gravity is your ally.

23:43.960 --> 23:45.962
The laws of physics govern speed.

23:46.120 --> 23:49.522
All right, Dusty.
Give this run all you've got.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.399
<i>Use your radial-G.</i>

23:51.400 --> 23:52.811
<i>Let gravity work for you.</i>

23:55.040 --> 23:58.479
<i>Looking good.
That's what I'm talking about.</i>

23:58.480 --> 24:00.687
Firewall the throttle! Go! Go! Go!

24:00.920 --> 24:02.570
You got it, Duster!

24:04.520 --> 24:05.760
<i>Begin your climb!</i>

24:05.960 --> 24:07.919
<i>All right, altitude for airspeed.</i>

24:07.920 --> 24:09.251
<i>Catch him in the dive!</i>

24:09.400 --> 24:11.164
<i>Dive now!</i>

24:17.160 --> 24:19.049
Ballistic!

24:20.360 --> 24:22.408
<i>He kicked
Aston Martins out there!</i>

24:22.640 --> 24:24.768
- Dusterino!
- He's ready.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.199
- Whoa!
- Oh, that's cool.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.363
The piston and cross-wrenches.
Your squadron insignia.

24:33.520 --> 24:34.646
- You've earned it.
- It fits you.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.603
- It fits you, Dusty.
- Now, listen.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.569
When the race starts and
all those planes take off,

24:38.680 --> 24:40.603
it'll stir up a bunch of swirlies

24:40.800 --> 24:43.121
just like the Wrenches ran into
in the Battle of Airway.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.561
Roger that. Sure wish
you were coming with me, Skip.

24:45.720 --> 24:48.200
Just radio back when
you get to the check points.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.249
I'll be your wingman from here.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.323
<i>Volo Pro Veritas,</i> right?

24:52.480 --> 24:54.562
<i>Volo Pro Veritas.</i>

24:54.760 --> 24:56.799
- Kick some tail, buddy.
- We're all proud of you.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.211
Whoo-hoo! Dustmeister!

25:04.800 --> 25:06.211
Wow.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.439
<i>Break, break.</i>

25:19.440 --> 25:21.159
<i>Air racer number 7, Air racer number 7.</i>

25:21.160 --> 25:23.288
<i>Do you read? Kennedy approach, over.</i>

25:25.440 --> 25:29.081
I'm Dusty Crophopper,
I'm looking for JFK airport.

25:29.240 --> 25:31.639
<i>Crophopper 7, you are supposed
to be on the Carnice visual.</i>

25:31.640 --> 25:33.324
<i>Turn further left, heading 1-9-5.</i>

25:33.480 --> 25:36.450
<i>Maintain 1,000 feet.
Intercept the 22 right localizer.</i>

25:36.600 --> 25:38.441
<i>You are cleared for
the ILS 22, right approach.</i>

25:38.640 --> 25:40.679
- Roger.
<i>- Heavy is sectored in behind you.</i>

25:40.680 --> 25:41.841
Run that by me one more time.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.759
<i>Turn further left,
heading 1-9-5. Maintain 1, 000...</i>

25:43.760 --> 25:44.881
Never mind. I got it.

25:45.280 --> 25:46.281
Do you see him?

25:46.800 --> 25:48.689
Well, radar does, but I don't see diddly.

25:52.680 --> 25:57.129
Check out this pavement!
Nice! It's so smooth.

25:57.320 --> 26:00.005
<i>Crophopper 7, you passed Foxtrot.
Turn left onto Charlie.</i>

26:00.160 --> 26:01.161
<i>Hold short at 22.</i>

26:01.360 --> 26:03.124
Wait, I thought...

26:03.280 --> 26:04.691
<i>- Get off the runway!</i>
- Whoa!

26:09.160 --> 26:11.970
- Oh. Sorry.
- Go back to Jersey, you bum.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.201
Excuse me, where can I...

26:13.360 --> 26:15.522
Hey-ho, do you mind? I'm working here.

26:15.680 --> 26:16.839
Sorry.

26:16.840 --> 26:20.447
A nice enough guy, but way too much
baggage, if you know what I mean.

26:20.640 --> 26:22.961
Oh, hey, there. I'm looking for pit row.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.849
The pits? Oh, yeah, that's easy.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.367
You want to go down this way
toward the fire station.

26:27.560 --> 26:30.166
Then taxiway alpha forks off to the left.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.559
But don't go that way.
You want to veer right.

26:32.560 --> 26:35.530
And if you get to the orange barrels,
you went too far. So...

26:35.680 --> 26:37.523
Just go straight ahead and to the right.

26:37.680 --> 26:41.002
Great, thanks. Hey, nice paint job.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.521
Well, thank you! I'm kind of proud of it.

26:43.680 --> 26:46.206
- I think he was talking to me.
- Oh.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.926
Well, looky who's here.
The Scandinavian.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.929
- Hey. Uh...
- Miss your home town?

26:53.280 --> 26:55.559
I don't. Just about blocked
that memory out of my mind.

26:55.560 --> 26:57.239
But you're bringing it
right back with that...

26:57.240 --> 27:01.040
Oh, man, that nasty
Vita-mina-stink-a-bunch.

27:01.480 --> 27:03.519
Your tent's the last one on the left. Go!

27:03.520 --> 27:05.010
Okay.

27:05.160 --> 27:08.084
Power wash is on the right. Just saying.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.879
Wow! Bulldog?
From the European Cup? The Big Dog!

27:12.880 --> 27:15.929
Hey, I saw you do this unbelievable
high-G vertical turn.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.041
How did you do that?

27:17.200 --> 27:18.531
Well, let me tell you.

27:18.680 --> 27:22.241
In fact, why don't I tell you
all my racing secrets?

27:22.640 --> 27:24.244
- Really?
- No.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.004
Look, I don't know how things work

27:26.120 --> 27:28.679
in the backwater
from which you hail, matey,

27:28.680 --> 27:30.250
but this is a competition.

27:30.400 --> 27:33.404
Every plane for himself! Goodbye.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.244
Yeah, sure.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.730
- Whoa... Whoa!
- Oh.

27:38.440 --> 27:39.879
Uh... Oh.

27:39.880 --> 27:42.239
Wait a second. This is aeroshell 100.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.641
I thought I ordered the DT-2380.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.802
Well, I am sorry you had to see that.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.919
- Are you all right?
- Sure. Why wouldn't I be?

27:49.920 --> 27:54.879
And you are Pan-Asian Champion
and Mumbai Cup record holder, Ishani.

27:54.880 --> 27:57.119
Most people call me just "Ishani."

27:57.120 --> 27:59.600
I'm Dusty. I mean, uh,
my name is Dusty.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.610
I'm not actually dusty,
I'm quite clean.

28:02.760 --> 28:06.890
It's very nice to meet you,
"quite clean" Dusty.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.770
Nice to meet you, too.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.763
Look at that propeller.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.121
Ooh.

28:13.280 --> 28:15.442
A little over there.
Not so much pressure, okay?

28:15.600 --> 28:17.762
Oh, excuse me, guys. Pardon me.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.011
Yeah.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.571
Hey, look who made it!

28:22.120 --> 28:23.770
- It's the crop duster.
- Hey.

28:23.920 --> 28:26.526
You know, having you here
is a nice vehicle-interest story.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.642
Small-town farmer
makes it to the big time.

28:28.800 --> 28:29.999
Yes, sir.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.162
- But tragically crashes on takeoff.
- What?

28:32.360 --> 28:33.919
Wings Around The Globe winner,
Ripslinger,

28:33.920 --> 28:38.209
eulogizes the unknown hayseed
and scatters his debris over a cornfield.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.970
Ratings will be through the roof!

28:40.120 --> 28:41.929
- Okay.
- Good luck.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.839
- Farm boy.
- What?

28:47.200 --> 28:49.965
The hero of the people has arrived.

28:53.040 --> 28:56.362
You have never heard
of the great El Chupacabra?

28:59.840 --> 29:02.923
Hey, isn't that that monster
that siphons fuel from small vehicles?

29:03.120 --> 29:05.279
No, no, no, it's just a stage name

29:05.280 --> 29:09.046
designed to strike fear into the hearts
of my opponents.

29:09.320 --> 29:12.130
Yeah, he's the indoor racing
champion of all Mexico.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.281
Indoor racing?

29:15.760 --> 29:19.765
And <i>numero uno</i> recording artist,
telenovela star and romance novelist.

29:19.920 --> 29:23.766
Did you say El Chupacabra
or El Cuckoo-sabre?

29:23.960 --> 29:27.646
You make joke? You make joke?

29:28.720 --> 29:31.839
Very well. You leave me no choice!

29:31.840 --> 29:35.526
I swish my cape at you!

29:36.200 --> 29:39.044
You have been shamed.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.888
I hope I can get over it.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.361
Oh. I just did!

29:45.720 --> 29:47.959
Hey, I saw you race
on Telemoto last year.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.239
Of course, it was in Spanish,
so I didn't understand everything.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.083
I am flattered, <i>avión pequeño.</i>

29:52.240 --> 29:54.766
You have done many of these
long distance rallies, yes?

29:54.920 --> 29:57.879
- No, this is my first one.
- It is my first time, as well!

29:57.880 --> 30:00.087
We will have many adventures,
you and I.

30:00.240 --> 30:02.759
We will laugh, we will cry,
we will dance!

30:02.760 --> 30:03.761
Um... Wow.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.008
- Probably not with each other.
- Of course.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.362
I will see you in the skies, amigo.

30:10.960 --> 30:14.239
<i>Race fans,
it's that time of year again.</i>

30:14.240 --> 30:16.891
<i>Welcome to the
Wings Around The Globe.</i>

30:17.440 --> 30:19.283
Hello, I'm Brent Mustangburger,

30:19.440 --> 30:22.523
and this is the flagship event
of the world's fastest sport

30:22.680 --> 30:24.887
where only the best
of the best compete.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.566
<i>Each leg brings a new challenge,</i>

30:27.760 --> 30:31.446
<i>testing agility, navigation
and endurance.</i>

30:31.840 --> 30:35.731
But when it's all said and done,
speed is the name of the game.

30:36.080 --> 30:37.719
Our very own Colin Cowling

30:37.720 --> 30:41.770
is standing by live from JFK airport
with the best seat in the house.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.331
How's the view, big guy?

30:43.800 --> 30:46.399
Brent, the scene below me
is absolutely electric.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.971
As you know, we have racers
from all over the world, here.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.885
But the real story should be
who's coming in second

30:52.040 --> 30:55.123
to three-time defending champ,
Ripslinger,

30:55.280 --> 30:58.250
who is seeking to become
the first four-time winner

30:58.400 --> 30:59.811
<i>in the Wings Around The Globe.</i>

31:00.440 --> 31:02.442
<i>The racers
are making their way to the runway.</i>

31:02.600 --> 31:03.721
- It's Dusty!
- Whoo!

31:04.000 --> 31:07.119
All right, everybody,
get your Dusty bobbleheads.

31:07.120 --> 31:10.999
Your oven mitts, hats, bumper stickers,
and I also ordered

31:11.000 --> 31:13.279
a thousand commemorative whistles.

31:13.280 --> 31:14.850
Hey, you think you can help me
set up a website?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.445
Does a giga bite?

31:16.640 --> 31:18.608
Well, not if you pet him nicely.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.326
Dusty.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.959
<i>One-hundred and thirty-six
nations compete.</i>

31:26.960 --> 31:29.008
<i>Twenty-one planes selected.</i>

31:30.640 --> 31:32.760
<i>Folks, a step onto this field,
is a step into history.</i>

31:38.480 --> 31:40.482
Holy smokes!

31:46.960 --> 31:51.841
And for the first time ever, folks,
we have a crop duster in the race.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.122
A crop duster?

31:54.280 --> 31:55.486
Well, he's gonna die.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.324
Ripslinger! Ripslinger!

32:07.680 --> 32:08.759
Wow!

32:08.760 --> 32:11.359
Ripslinger! Ripslinger! Ripslinger!

32:11.360 --> 32:13.080
Yeah. You're caught in the riptide!

32:17.360 --> 32:19.362
Whoa. Look at this crowd.

32:19.520 --> 32:23.161
Stay focused, <i>amigo.</i>
Don't let anything distract you.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.281
Ay-yay!

32:35.280 --> 32:37.199
Who is that vision?

32:37.200 --> 32:40.044
That's Rochelle,
the Canadian rally champ.

32:40.720 --> 32:43.319
She is like an angel, sent from heaven.

32:43.320 --> 32:46.961
Like a sunrise
after a lifetime of darkness.

32:47.160 --> 32:52.246
Like fresh fertilizer
on a field of dying grass.

32:53.560 --> 32:55.722
This is not your thing, my friend.

32:55.880 --> 32:59.441
<i>All right, racers.
Start your engines!</i>

33:05.720 --> 33:09.520
<i>Seven legs,
over 31, 000 kilometers,</i>

33:09.680 --> 33:12.763
<i>The world's highest mountains,
and the deepest oceans</i>

33:12.920 --> 33:14.126
<i>all stand before them</i>

33:14.280 --> 33:18.365
<i>just waiting to be conquered
by the right competitor.</i>

33:28.200 --> 33:30.328
Here we go. Oh, boy!

33:30.520 --> 33:31.879
<i>All the preparation.</i>

33:31.880 --> 33:33.644
<i>It all comes down to this moment.</i>

33:35.240 --> 33:38.759
<i>One of these planes is about to fly off
into the pages of sports history</i>

33:38.760 --> 33:40.808
<i>and become a champion.</i>

33:45.560 --> 33:46.641
Go!

33:47.520 --> 33:49.602
<i>And we are under way!</i>

34:13.800 --> 34:15.324
Whoa! Swirlies!

34:15.560 --> 34:16.846
Whoa! Whoa.

34:20.719 --> 34:22.359
<i>Our first stage is a Whopper.</i>

34:22.360 --> 34:24.487
<i>A dead sprint across the North Atlantic.</i>

34:24.639 --> 34:26.880
<i>That's right, Brent.
This is how it works, folks.</i>

34:27.000 --> 34:30.607
<i>The winner of the leg today
is the first to take off tomorrow.</i>

35:05.200 --> 35:09.524
Hey, look who's finally here!
It's that low-flying farmer boy!

35:09.720 --> 35:12.200
You do know this is a race, right?

35:14.040 --> 35:15.520
That's a good one, boss.

35:16.200 --> 35:19.602
Excuse me, how much does
a snow plow weigh?

35:19.720 --> 35:21.131
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i> I do not know.

35:21.280 --> 35:24.887
Enough to break the ice.
I am El Chupacabra.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.362
- Ah. You are the snow plow, oui?
- You could say that, yes.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.803
- And I am the ice?
- Yes.

35:32.120 --> 35:33.485
Cold, frozen and lifeless?

35:33.640 --> 35:35.927
No, I... It sounds better in Spanish.

35:36.080 --> 35:38.731
Why don't you go
plow yourself, El Chu-toy?

35:40.400 --> 35:42.641
She is like an angel.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.959
<i>This is Propwash
Junction to Dusty Crophopper.</i>

35:45.960 --> 35:46.961
I read you, Chug.

35:47.080 --> 35:49.447
<i>So what's it like
racing with the big dogs, Duster?</i>

35:49.720 --> 35:52.599
- Well, my wings froze solid.
<i>- Man!</i>

35:52.600 --> 35:54.799
- I had icicles hanging off my sprayer.
<i>- All right!</i>

35:54.800 --> 35:57.399
And I nearly smashed
into a 10-story iceberg.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.561
<i>Awesome!</i>

35:58.760 --> 36:00.959
<i>Yeah, "awesome" is not quite
the word that I would use</i>

36:00.960 --> 36:02.769
<i>to describe a gruesome
near-death experience.</i>

36:02.920 --> 36:04.001
You hang in there, buddy.

36:04.160 --> 36:07.403
There's nothing better than dying
while doing what you love most.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.602
<i>That's gonna make
him feel a lot better.</i>

36:09.800 --> 36:11.802
Dusty, just like when
the Jolly Wrenches

36:11.920 --> 36:13.079
were up in the Aleutians

36:13.080 --> 36:15.606
the air down close to the sea
has more moisture,

36:15.760 --> 36:17.250
which is why you took on ice.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.839
<i>- You gotta try to fly higher.</i>
- Great.

36:19.840 --> 36:20.966
<i>The good news is</i>

36:21.120 --> 36:23.805
<i>tomorrow's leg goes through
the Bavarian obstacle course.</i>

36:23.960 --> 36:27.203
<i>It's all about agility,
so it's your chance to move up.</i>

36:28.360 --> 36:31.443
<i>And remember, it's not speed
that wins races, it's skill.</i>

36:45.120 --> 36:49.011
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
I'm blinded. I can't see.</i>

36:50.040 --> 36:51.119
We're receiving breaking news

36:51.120 --> 36:53.959
of an incident in the skies over
Germany involving one of the racers.

36:53.960 --> 36:56.486
Let's check in with Skycam 1
for more information.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.802
Bulldog, the legendary flyer from

36:59.320 --> 37:00.845
the UK, is in tremendous danger.

37:00.960 --> 37:04.487
<i>It looks like he's flying blind,
losing speed, losing altitude...</i>

37:04.960 --> 37:07.759
Wait! It's Racer Number 7, Crophopper,

37:07.760 --> 37:09.440
- pulling up beside him.
- What's he doing?

37:09.600 --> 37:12.199
- Bulldog, apply your left aileron.
- Okay.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.201
Stop roll.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.639
- Now, quick, pull up.
- Got it.

37:14.640 --> 37:15.721
Harder, harder!

37:15.840 --> 37:17.968
Slight roll right. Good!

37:19.360 --> 37:22.523
Whoa! Big castle!
Pull up! Hard roll right!

37:23.680 --> 37:24.727
Stop roll.

37:25.680 --> 37:26.879
Are you still there?

37:26.880 --> 37:28.920
I'm right here.
I'll fly right alongside you.

37:29.160 --> 37:32.004
<i>Achtung! We have
a mayday! Clear the runway!</i>

37:32.160 --> 37:34.003
Achtung! <i>Clear the runway!</i>

37:34.160 --> 37:35.525
- Add power.
- Okay.

37:35.680 --> 37:36.727
- Easy, now.
- Yes.

37:36.880 --> 37:40.362
Good. Flaps down, lock them.

37:40.680 --> 37:41.966
Careful.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.127
Landing gear down.

37:43.320 --> 37:44.481
Yeah, and locked.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.045
Begin your flare.

37:46.240 --> 37:47.759
Power back a little.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.290
Touchdown! Nicely done!

37:58.680 --> 38:00.250
Thanks for your help, matey.

38:00.560 --> 38:02.879
I couldn't have done it without...

38:02.880 --> 38:05.724
You? You saved me?

38:05.880 --> 38:08.399
What did I tell you, boy?
Every plane for himself, right?

38:08.400 --> 38:11.290
Where I come from, if you see someone
falling from the sky...

38:11.480 --> 38:15.166
Yes, but this is a competition.
Now, you're dead last.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.806
And I owe you my life.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.281
Are you crying?

38:20.480 --> 38:22.562
I don't cry, I'm British!

38:24.040 --> 38:25.405
Thanks, matey.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.723
Sure thing, Bulldog.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.639
Bulldog!

38:30.760 --> 38:34.606
Well, I gotta say,
crop duster, you are a nice guy.

38:34.760 --> 38:35.919
Hey. Thanks, Rip.

38:35.920 --> 38:38.241
And we all know where nice guys finish.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.084
Yeah!

38:52.800 --> 38:55.007
Dead last.

38:55.680 --> 38:59.082
You sad, you drink.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.925
Thanks. Great advice.

39:02.080 --> 39:05.448
At least you are not last
in the race for love.

39:05.680 --> 39:06.761
Rochelle?

39:06.920 --> 39:11.960
Her passion is, sadly, not for me.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.642
Tough break, El Chu.

39:15.680 --> 39:16.759
Excuse me.

39:16.760 --> 39:20.519
My name is Franz, and I am a huge fan.

39:20.520 --> 39:23.999
- I have fans?
- Oh, no, no, no. Just me.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.847
And I would like to say <i>danke</i>
for representing all us little planes.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.169
Uh... You're a car.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.999
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I am
what you call a <i>Flugzeugauto,</i>

39:35.000 --> 39:37.970
one of only six flying cars ever built!

39:45.480 --> 39:47.323
- Whoa!
<i>- Guten Tag, Herr</i> Dusty.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.088
I am Von Fliegenhozen.

39:50.320 --> 39:51.879
Didn't you just say
your name was Franz?

39:51.880 --> 39:53.086
<i>Nein, nein, nein.</i>

39:53.200 --> 39:55.239
Franz is a guy with no spine

39:55.240 --> 39:58.239
who is in charge
when we putter about the cobblestones.

39:58.240 --> 40:01.084
In the air, I am in charge.

40:01.400 --> 40:04.643
This guy needs to
get his head gasket checked.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.485
Serious identity issues.

40:07.680 --> 40:10.889
This from the one wearing a mask?

40:11.920 --> 40:13.251
Touché.

40:13.560 --> 40:16.040
We are both pulling for you, <i>Herr</i> Dusty.

40:16.680 --> 40:19.001
Thanks for the support.
I need all the help I can get.

40:19.240 --> 40:21.839
I have a humble suggestion.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.524
Would you not be much faster

40:23.680 --> 40:26.729
without the pipes and tank
and whatnot weighing you down?

40:26.880 --> 40:28.211
My Sprayer. Again?

40:28.400 --> 40:30.846
Yeah.
Why carry around the extra weight?

40:31.160 --> 40:32.679
The little crazy car is right.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.251
Perhaps you need to start
thinking like a racer.

40:37.680 --> 40:39.519
This is reversible, right?

40:39.520 --> 40:42.079
Oh! Oh. Hey, you're being
careful down there, right?

40:42.080 --> 40:44.208
Whoa. Ooh! Yep, that's cold.

40:46.680 --> 40:48.039
So?

40:49.160 --> 40:50.810
So, what do you think?

40:51.680 --> 40:52.839
<i>Wunderbar,</i> Dusty.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.205
<i>Fantastico.</i>

40:54.360 --> 40:55.771
It is freeing, yes?

40:55.960 --> 40:58.201
Yeah, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

40:59.800 --> 41:01.290
Bye-bye, sprayer!

41:01.440 --> 41:03.966
Thanks for everything, Franz...
Er, Von Fliegenhozen.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.804
<i>Guten</i> luck, <i>Herr</i> Dusty.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.519
<i>It's our third leg</i>

41:08.520 --> 41:10.839
<i>and we've already lost several
competitors to equipment failure.</i>

41:10.840 --> 41:13.730
<i>But the real story here, Brent,
is Dusty Crophopper.</i>

41:13.880 --> 41:14.927
Absolutely.

41:15.720 --> 41:16.959
He's passing one flier after another.

41:16.960 --> 41:19.645
<i>That's right. This guy
was built to dust crops,</i>

41:19.800 --> 41:21.928
<i>but he's dusting the competition.</i>

41:22.560 --> 41:24.483
<i>What's next, Colin?</i>

41:24.640 --> 41:26.399
<i>Brent, this could be
Crophopper's leg, all the way.</i>

41:26.400 --> 41:29.404
<i>The racers will have to fly
under a hard ceiling of 1,000 feet.</i>

41:30.240 --> 41:31.924
<i>Stay under the clouds and in the hills.</i>

41:32.240 --> 41:33.685
Number 20 is disqualified.

41:41.120 --> 41:42.959
<i>- What a move.</i>
<i>- Incredible.</i>

41:42.960 --> 41:45.281
<i>- Look at that radial-G pass.</i>
- Oh, yeah!

41:46.240 --> 41:47.919
<i>From last place,
all the way up to eighth.</i>

41:47.920 --> 41:50.279
<i>Mr. Ripslinger,
you were built for racing.</i>

41:50.280 --> 41:51.480
<i>Yeah! You know it.</i>

41:51.600 --> 41:53.523
<i>So how can a crop duster out-fly you?</i>

41:53.680 --> 41:54.919
<i>- Wait, what?
- There he is!</i>

41:54.920 --> 41:55.921
<i>Dusty!</i>

41:56.360 --> 41:58.039
- Wow!
<i>- How do you keep up with the pros?</i>

41:58.040 --> 42:00.359
<i>Did working
on the farm make you stronger?</i>

42:00.360 --> 42:02.120
<i>Dusty!
Why do you fly so low?</i>

42:02.280 --> 42:04.519
Why are they wasting their time
with him?

42:04.520 --> 42:06.124
He's a tractor with wings.

42:06.840 --> 42:09.439
Actually, it's a really
compelling underdog story.

42:09.440 --> 42:10.519
It's like <i>Rocky.</i>

42:10.520 --> 42:11.919
It's more like David and Goliath.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.479
- Or <i>Old Yeller.</i>
- That's not an underdog story.

42:13.480 --> 42:15.005
- Well, there's a dog in it.
- Enough!

42:15.200 --> 42:16.406
Yeah, enough!

42:16.600 --> 42:18.682
You know, they shot Old Yeller
at the end, you twits.

42:18.840 --> 42:20.001
Oh! Spoiler alert!

42:20.120 --> 42:24.409
Soon, we'll be overrun by every banner
tower, skywriter and air freighter

42:24.520 --> 42:27.171
who thinks they can be one of us.

42:27.320 --> 42:31.803
That farm boy forgot who he is
and where he came from.

42:32.120 --> 42:35.329
He's not about to stop me
from making history.

42:35.560 --> 42:37.319
<i>Dusty, Dusty,
where did you learn to race?</i>

42:37.320 --> 42:38.367
<i>From my coach, Skipper.</i>

42:38.640 --> 42:41.120
<i>He's the reason I'm even here.
He's an amazing instructor.</i>

42:41.800 --> 42:42.847
<i>And a great friend.</i>

42:43.000 --> 42:46.004
<i>He flew dozens of missions
all around the world.</i>

42:46.160 --> 42:49.164
<i>And I'm sure, if he could,
he'd be with us right now.</i>

43:52.160 --> 43:55.039
Whoa, your engine
sounds kind of rough.

43:55.040 --> 43:57.566
Must be a mag misfire.

43:58.200 --> 44:01.966
It's probably not a good night
for flying anyway.

44:04.280 --> 44:08.569
- Okay. Come back soon.
- Hey, you got anything new?

44:08.840 --> 44:09.919
I'm glad you asked.

44:09.920 --> 44:13.766
I'm now selling these one-of-a-kind
Dusty commemorative mugs.

44:14.400 --> 44:15.606
Huh?

44:15.960 --> 44:16.961
Whoa!

44:17.320 --> 44:18.720
<i>This is Dusty Crophopper calling...</i>

44:18.840 --> 44:21.119
- I'll be back in 10.
- Dusty, eighth place!

44:21.120 --> 44:22.849
Way to go, Dustmeister!

44:23.000 --> 44:25.959
- Hey! You finally removed your M5000.
- His what?

44:25.960 --> 44:28.281
His Micro-Air-5000-D-L
Aerial Applicator.

44:28.440 --> 44:30.010
Use your words.

44:30.160 --> 44:31.525
His sprayer.

44:31.680 --> 44:33.519
Right! Sprayer.

44:33.520 --> 44:35.090
Dusty, you got a big leg tomorrow.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.083
- Yeah.
<i>- How you feeling?</i>

44:37.240 --> 44:39.481
<i>I can't believe it.
The mighty Himalayas.</i>

44:39.640 --> 44:41.608
<i>Dusty, that vertical wind shear</i>

44:41.760 --> 44:44.279
is going to be wicked
over those mountains.

44:44.280 --> 44:46.279
Well, the good thing
about being that high up,

44:46.280 --> 44:48.009
you see, there's not a lot of oxygen.

44:48.200 --> 44:49.929
So, if you crash, no explosion.

44:50.120 --> 44:51.279
Great, Chug.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.119
<i>Of course,
you could die of hypothermia</i>

44:53.120 --> 44:54.770
<i>or an avalanche could get you.</i>

44:54.960 --> 44:56.769
<i>Then, of course, there's
pneumonia, or even frostbite.</i>

44:56.960 --> 44:58.325
Chug, Chug, I got it.

44:58.480 --> 45:00.639
Skip, what if a guy wanted to fly

45:00.640 --> 45:02.359
through the mountains
instead of over them?

45:02.360 --> 45:05.284
<i>Bad idea. The Wrenches
flew through terrain like that</i>

45:05.440 --> 45:07.568
in the Assault of Kunming.
And Dottie is right.

45:08.640 --> 45:09.719
Wind coming over the peaks
can stir up rotors

45:09.720 --> 45:10.960
<i>that'll drag you right down.</i>

45:11.120 --> 45:13.487
<i>If you ask me, it's time to lug-nut up.</i>

45:13.640 --> 45:16.689
<i>You can fly a whole lot higher
than you think.</i>

45:16.840 --> 45:18.959
- Roger that.
<i>- Hola, corazón.</i>

45:18.960 --> 45:20.799
- Are you tired?
- What?

45:20.800 --> 45:24.771
Because you have been flying
through my mind, nonstop.

45:25.200 --> 45:30.331
Hmm. And why would I be tired flying
through such a teeny, tiny space, huh?

45:31.640 --> 45:34.246
You can only pretend for so long.

45:34.640 --> 45:37.962
Hey, El Chu, what's the problem?

45:38.560 --> 45:42.201
I am Icarus and she is the sun.

45:42.400 --> 45:45.483
I fly too close and I melt.

45:45.640 --> 45:47.085
Maybe you're trying too hard.

45:47.240 --> 45:51.165
Look, all you got to do is go over,
open your mouth and say...

45:51.320 --> 45:52.606
Hello.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.001
Wha... Uh...

45:58.520 --> 45:59.521
Whoa.

46:01.840 --> 46:03.079
El Chupacabra!

46:03.080 --> 46:05.526
I think someone is calling me.
I have to go.

46:06.200 --> 46:08.931
I wanted to compliment you
on your success, Dusty.

46:09.080 --> 46:12.129
You're doing very well
for your first race.

46:12.440 --> 46:13.839
Aw, that means a lot, coming from you.

46:13.840 --> 46:15.205
I mean, come on,

46:15.360 --> 46:18.639
you were named most aerodynamic
racer by <i>Air Sports Illustrated.</i>

46:18.640 --> 46:22.079
And let me just say,
you are so aerodynamic.

46:22.080 --> 46:23.684
Dusty.

46:26.920 --> 46:28.800
What's with
all the tractors around here?

46:28.960 --> 46:30.279
They're sacred.

46:30.280 --> 46:33.359
Many believe that
we will be recycled as tractors.

46:33.360 --> 46:36.489
Oh. Well, I believe in recycling.

46:37.720 --> 46:39.722
Have you ever been to the Taj Mahal?

46:39.960 --> 46:41.959
No. No, I haven't.

46:41.960 --> 46:43.724
Come on. Let's go.

46:56.400 --> 46:58.164
It must be nice to be back home.

46:58.320 --> 47:01.881
Well, it's complicated.
I have a billion fans.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.969
And they're all expecting me to win.

47:04.080 --> 47:06.287
Maybe this time, you will.

47:31.440 --> 47:32.441
Wow.

47:32.800 --> 47:34.802
This place is amazing.

47:34.960 --> 47:36.291
It really is.

47:36.440 --> 47:40.365
And tomorrow, you'll fly over
the magnificent Himalayas.

47:40.520 --> 47:42.966
Those little hills?
Yeah, well... No big deal.

47:43.120 --> 47:45.282
You like to fly low, don't you?

47:45.440 --> 47:47.966
Oh. Oh, that? Uh, that's strategic.

47:48.280 --> 47:50.362
Air density and, uh, combustion.

47:50.560 --> 47:54.326
You know, you could follow
the Iron Compass, instead.

47:54.520 --> 47:57.330
- Iron Compass?
- Yeah, rail road tracks.

47:57.440 --> 48:00.649
Through a valley in the mountains,
so you can still fly low.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.290
Really?

48:03.400 --> 48:05.050
Thanks, Ishani.

48:05.200 --> 48:06.645
Anytime.

48:08.480 --> 48:12.039
<i>Every racer's nightmare
is scaling the Himalayas.</i>

48:12.040 --> 48:15.203
<i>It's a short leg ahead,
but extremely treacherous.</i>

48:46.000 --> 48:47.161
No.

49:05.640 --> 49:08.041
Ow! Ah!

49:09.720 --> 49:11.006
Whoa!

49:22.160 --> 49:23.286
Whoa!

49:53.520 --> 49:54.599
Uh...

49:54.600 --> 49:56.443
Hello?

50:01.800 --> 50:04.531
Is this where I'm supposed to be?

50:05.520 --> 50:09.684
That is one of life's great questions.

50:11.520 --> 50:13.124
I'm dead!

50:13.320 --> 50:14.446
Mr. Crophopper.

50:15.480 --> 50:17.403
Welcome to Nepal.

50:17.600 --> 50:20.126
I don't understand.
Have the others left already?

50:20.280 --> 50:22.519
Actually, no one else is here yet.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.921
You're in first place.

50:25.120 --> 50:26.167
Really?

50:26.520 --> 50:28.409
He flew through a what?

50:29.800 --> 50:30.919
- A tunnel?
- That is crazy!

50:30.920 --> 50:33.446
Si, crazy like a Firefox.

50:35.360 --> 50:37.279
Dusty, how does it feel
to be in first place?

50:37.280 --> 50:38.441
It feels great.

50:38.600 --> 50:41.649
But more than anything,
I'm just happy I fit through that tunnel.

50:42.640 --> 50:45.200
Guys, I gotta tell you,
if you're ever in a tight squeeze just...

50:48.120 --> 50:49.645
Excuse me, guys.

50:52.520 --> 50:54.363
Crazy day today, huh?

50:55.040 --> 50:58.965
Oh. Yeah, a very exciting
win for you today.

50:59.120 --> 51:01.327
Quite a risk you took.

51:01.480 --> 51:04.479
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, your propeller, is it new?

51:04.480 --> 51:06.642
Oh. I suppose it is.

51:06.920 --> 51:08.639
Sky Slycer Mark Five, right?

51:08.640 --> 51:11.644
Aren't those made exclusively
for Ripslinger's race team?

51:11.800 --> 51:14.531
- Are they?
- Yeah. Yeah, they are.

51:14.680 --> 51:16.205
Dusty...

51:16.440 --> 51:18.920
- You set me up.
- Look, I didn't ever want to hurt you.

51:19.080 --> 51:22.159
- Why?
- It's complicated, okay?

51:22.160 --> 51:23.799
You could have gotten me
killed out there today.

51:23.800 --> 51:26.326
I really thought that
you'd just turn around.

51:26.520 --> 51:28.679
Well, you were wrong.

51:28.680 --> 51:30.444
And I was wrong about you.

51:32.680 --> 51:35.365
Hey, Rip. Thanks for first place.

51:38.520 --> 51:39.759
<i>Flying low and quick,</i>

51:39.760 --> 51:42.764
<i>Dusty Crophopper is managing
to hold on to the top spot.</i>

51:43.000 --> 51:46.243
<i>But current reigning champ, Ripslinger,
is just seconds behind him.</i>

51:46.440 --> 51:48.204
<i>This surprise battle for first place</i>

51:48.360 --> 51:50.362
has made Dusty Crophopper
the one to watch.

51:50.720 --> 51:54.088
<i>He's become a working-class hero
around the globe.</i>

52:09.320 --> 52:10.731
Whoa!

52:10.880 --> 52:13.565
I told you he could do it.

52:19.720 --> 52:21.439
- That's it.
- Wha... Aw!

52:21.440 --> 52:23.442
That was my skyPad, man.

52:23.600 --> 52:25.762
A new one's
coming out in two weeks.

52:30.240 --> 52:32.359
<i>You're really showing them
big-time racers a thing or two, huh?</i>

52:32.360 --> 52:35.319
Yeah. We head out across
the Pacific tomorrow, Skip.

52:35.320 --> 52:37.119
You were stationed there
for a while, right?

52:37.120 --> 52:39.279
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Got any advice?

52:39.280 --> 52:42.284
Back in '41,
during the Battle over Wake Island

52:42.520 --> 52:45.039
<i>the Wrenches ran into
serious monsoons</i>

52:45.040 --> 52:47.959
<i>with embedded CBs that could
tear your wings right off.</i>

52:47.960 --> 52:50.406
<i>Be careful. And one more thing...</i>

52:51.680 --> 52:53.045
I'm proud of you, Dusty.

52:54.040 --> 52:56.327
Thanks, wingman.

52:56.520 --> 52:59.251
Hey, Dusty, we have a surprise for you.

52:59.440 --> 53:00.559
Oh, oh, oh!
You have to let me tell him.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.439
Go ahead, Chug.

53:02.440 --> 53:06.240
Uh... Oh, I know it. It's...
It's on the tip of my tongue.

53:06.440 --> 53:07.519
I'll remember.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.090
We're going...

53:09.400 --> 53:11.159
<i>We're going...</i>

53:11.160 --> 53:13.083
- to...
- To...

53:13.520 --> 53:15.559
- Mmm...
- Malays...

53:15.560 --> 53:17.799
- Mexico.
- Mexico! That's it!

53:17.800 --> 53:20.531
- We're going to meet you in Mexico.
- Really?

53:20.720 --> 53:22.643
Yep. Tickets are on Sparky and me.

53:22.800 --> 53:27.010
We sold 326 Dusty bobbleheads,
143 antenna balls,

53:27.160 --> 53:29.003
203 spinner mugs...

53:29.160 --> 53:34.166
And 1,000 whistles.
Go, Team Dusterino! Yeah!

53:34.600 --> 53:36.090
You sure you're up for it, Skipper?

53:36.360 --> 53:38.761
You bet.
Somebody else is doing the flying.

53:38.960 --> 53:41.201
That's great news, guys.
I'll see you in Mexico.

53:41.320 --> 53:42.399
<i>Buenas noches!</i>

53:42.400 --> 53:44.129
<i>I'll bring the salsa!
Whoo-hoo!</i>

53:46.800 --> 53:48.962
Hey, El Chu, where's the fire?

53:49.160 --> 53:51.083
It is in my soul.

53:51.240 --> 53:54.369
Tonight, I shall win the heart

53:54.520 --> 53:57.603
of Miss Rochelle.

54:03.480 --> 54:05.448
Ugh!

54:13.160 --> 54:16.004
No, no, no. A thousand no's.

54:31.400 --> 54:33.528
Dusty, what are you doing?

54:44.400 --> 54:46.687
Low and slow.

54:51.280 --> 54:53.408
Oh...

56:04.920 --> 56:06.570
What does that mean?

56:06.720 --> 56:12.124
No idea, but French-Canadian
is the language of love in Quebec.

56:12.280 --> 56:13.486
So, it's got to be good.

56:13.680 --> 56:15.250
I'm in your debt, <i>compadre.</i>

56:15.400 --> 56:18.370
If ever you need me, I shall be there.

56:18.560 --> 56:21.643
<i>Compadre.</i> I like that.

56:22.560 --> 56:23.959
You are looking live

56:23.960 --> 56:26.691
at Pudong Shanghai
International Airport...

56:27.360 --> 56:31.604
Yep. First place.
Not too bad for a farm boy.

56:33.280 --> 56:34.359
Oh, yeah?

56:34.360 --> 56:36.203
Well, first place is for losers.

56:36.360 --> 56:38.089
Can it, moron!

56:38.200 --> 56:39.201
- Ow!

56:39.360 --> 56:42.603
Now, listen up.
It's time to make yourselves useful.

56:45.080 --> 56:46.320
What happened to you?

56:46.480 --> 56:49.450
That song. It flipped a switch.

56:49.600 --> 56:52.729
Oh, my little monster.
Come here.

56:52.880 --> 56:54.441
Please! No!

56:56.280 --> 56:58.806
She is like a jaguar now.

56:58.960 --> 57:00.325
Oh, my little burrito.

57:00.520 --> 57:01.646
Be gentle with me!

57:01.800 --> 57:04.929
<i>Start your engines.</i>

57:09.920 --> 57:12.287
<i>This is our sixth
and longest leg.</i>

57:12.440 --> 57:15.046
<i>These racers will need to
follow their GPS antennas</i>

57:15.200 --> 57:18.921
<i>because there's a big ocean
between here and Mexico.</i>

57:31.120 --> 57:32.121
Ah!

57:32.920 --> 57:34.126
My antenna!

57:35.960 --> 57:38.042
Oh, no! No! No!

57:40.320 --> 57:42.004
What am I going to do?

57:43.560 --> 57:45.050
<i>Last known coordinates,</i>

57:45.200 --> 57:47.089
<i>26 degrees, 31 minutes.</i>

57:47.280 --> 57:48.691
<i>Hawaii, are you there?</i>

57:48.960 --> 57:52.879
Do you read? I am low on fuel.

57:52.880 --> 57:55.121
Oh, no!

57:55.680 --> 57:56.727
Oh, boy.

57:59.440 --> 58:00.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

58:01.200 --> 58:04.647
Unknown rider, unknown rider.
You have entered restricted airspace.

58:04.880 --> 58:06.560
Why haven't you responded
to radio contact?

58:06.680 --> 58:08.091
<i>Somebody cut off my antenna.</i>

58:08.240 --> 58:10.686
<i>- Identify yourself.
- I'm Dusty Crophopper.</i>

58:10.880 --> 58:11.881
<i>Roger that.</i>

58:12.120 --> 58:13.565
Bogey has been identified
as Crophopper Seven.

58:13.680 --> 58:15.808
I'm running on vapors. I need to land.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.849
What are you doing out here
with an empty tank?

58:18.000 --> 58:19.650
I thought I'd refuel in Hawaii, but...

58:19.800 --> 58:22.439
Hawaii is 375 miles southwest of here.

58:22.440 --> 58:23.441
- What?
- Listen, Crophopper.

58:23.560 --> 58:24.891
You better follow us to the boat.

58:25.080 --> 58:26.366
No bingo fields around here.

58:26.480 --> 58:28.959
- "Bingo fields"?
- Places to land.

58:28.960 --> 58:31.964
- The boat?
<i>- The USS Dwight D. Flysenhower.</i>

58:33.440 --> 58:35.759
<i>Bravo, checking in as frag plus one.
Check.</i>

58:35.760 --> 58:37.285
<i>- Two.
- Go ahead, Bravo.</i>

58:37.440 --> 58:39.279
<i>Bogey is civilian.
Needs emergency fuel.</i>

58:39.280 --> 58:41.399
- Copy that.
- For flying out loud!

58:41.400 --> 58:44.085
That's all I need,
a civilian exploding on my deck.

58:44.240 --> 58:45.810
We could rig the barricade, sir.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.206
All engines, ahead flank.

58:47.360 --> 58:50.409
Aye, Captain. All engines ahead flank.

58:50.720 --> 58:52.639
<i>- Rig the barricade.</i>
- Copy that.

58:52.640 --> 58:55.166
Rig the barricade!
Chop-chop. Hubba-hubba.

58:55.320 --> 58:57.000
Let's line you up
for the barricade.

58:57.120 --> 59:00.039
All you have to do is
throttle on back and call the ball

59:00.040 --> 59:01.804
and hopefully end up in the spaghetti.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.680
What? Wait, no, wait!
Wait a second!

59:03.840 --> 59:05.842
Guys, I'm not sure I can do this.

59:06.000 --> 59:07.365
I don't see how you have a choice.

59:07.560 --> 59:08.846
Okay. But that runway is moving.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.239
We'll set you up
on the glide path.

59:10.240 --> 59:11.605
Runways are not
supposed to move.

59:11.800 --> 59:13.599
Okay. I'm okay. I'm going to be fine.

59:13.600 --> 59:15.045
- Take it easy.
- Moving runway, moving runway.

59:15.320 --> 59:17.121
- There it is. Here we go.
- Throttle on back.

59:17.160 --> 59:18.161
Maybe if I just came around again.

59:18.400 --> 59:20.289
- Level your wings.
- Easy with it.

59:20.640 --> 59:22.130
Cut, cut, cut!

59:24.120 --> 59:25.451
Stop!

59:35.320 --> 59:38.164
We've got you, Crophopper.

59:39.120 --> 59:41.600
Come on, let's get you fixed up,
refueled and back in the race.

59:42.240 --> 59:43.571
You are way behind.

59:43.680 --> 59:45.489
Thanks, guys.
You saved my tail out there.

59:45.680 --> 59:47.364
- Victory.
- Victory.

59:48.600 --> 59:50.011
Hey, what is that?

59:50.120 --> 59:52.646
That's the Jolly Wrenches
Wall of Fame.

59:52.840 --> 59:54.171
Every flyer, every mission.

59:55.080 --> 59:57.321
Mmm... Skipper... Skipper...

59:57.480 --> 59:59.323
Oh. Ha-ha! There he is.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.647
Wait. I don't understand.
Why is there only one mission?

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.959
Chug, what's all that?

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:10.839
Well, I've never been out of the country.
You know, I brought the Commodium.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.047
Whatever you do, don't drink the petrol.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.679
We're only going for two days.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.284
Got to be prepared, right?

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.408
Got beachwear,
dinner wear, underwear...

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.722
<i>Skipper? Come in, Skipper.</i>

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.406
Dusty! We're heading off
to Mexico right now.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.879
Glad you got there safe.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.611
<i>Weather report says a major storm
is brewing out there.</i>

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.570
I'm not in Mexico.
I'm with the Jolly Wrenches.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.968
You're on the <i>Flysenhower?</i>

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.761
<i>Hey, I saw the Wall of Fame.
They only list one mission for you.</i>

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.002
Dusty, if you're not past
that storm yet, you need...

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.049
That can't be right. it must be a mistake.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.839
<i>Look, you have to get out of there.</i>

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.524
<i>You're going to have to fly high.</i>

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.759
Is it true?

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.841
<i>Listen to me, get above the storm!</i>

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.879
- Skipper, is it true?
<i>- It's true!</i>

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.602
It's true.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.161
I only flew one mission.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.128
But all those stories?

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.328
Crophopper,
we got weather moving in fast.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.319
You've got to take off
before it's too late.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.401
I just need a second here.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.719
That's a negative, son.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.529
You don't go now, you don't go at all.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.199
<i>Be advised, the JTWC has
issued a tropical cyclone formation alert</i>

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.879
<i>for the northeast Pacific ocean.</i>

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.519
<i>Area of convection is located
500 nautical miles</i>

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.010
<i>east-northeast of Hawaii.</i>

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.600
<i>Maximum sustained surface winds
are currently estimated at...</i>

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.599
Report to catapult two.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.683
The cat will take you from
zero to 160 knots in two seconds.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.999
Two seconds?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.839
We're going to check your weight
and set the steam pressure.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.968
Remember, climb straight ahead
once you get airborne.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.481
- Climb straight ahead.
- Get above the storm.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.686
Okay, engine full throttle.
Nod to the shooter when you're set.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.159
Go win it for the Wrenches, Dusty.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.288
<i>Volo Pro Veritas!</i>

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.282
Head Wind's good. Pressure's good.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.006
Go on cat two.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.839
<i>Señor</i> Ripslinger, any comment

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.444
on the disappearance
of Dusty Crophopper?

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.730
Dusty was a nice guy
who flew the challenge

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.042
and pierced the clouds of mediocrity.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.568
We're all going to miss him. Excuse me.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.161
Let's just hope he makes
a better boat than a plane.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.719
That's a good one, boss.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.927
Oh, yeah, that was pretty good.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.248
<i>Señor</i> Dusty
has 10 times the engine you do.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.004
And 10 times the integrity.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.686
Said the plane with
the shiny new propeller.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:34.804
How much integrity did
that one cost you, sweetheart?

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.801
Too much.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.804
You used to be a great champion.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:43.247
How the mighty have fallen.

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:50.251
You are not even worthy
of a cape swish.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.444
Really?

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.919
<i>How can it be only one mission?</i>

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.159
<i>The Battle of Airway.</i>

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.844
<i>The raid in Tujunga Harbor.
The Aleutians.</i>

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.884
<i>The Battle of Wake Island.
The Assault on Kunming.</i>

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.601
I gotta get above the storm!

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.201
Whoa!

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.086
Mayday! Mayday! I'm going down!

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.931
18 degrees north, six minutes, 119...

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.730
Help!

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.199
- Dusty!
<i>- Mi amigo!</i>

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.770
Quick, to the hangar.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:23.250
Broken wing ribs,
twisted gear, bent prop,

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:28.250
and your main spar is cracked bad.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.083
It's over.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.122
One mission?

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.561
So much for <i>Volo Pro Veritas.</i>

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.443
Can we get a minute alone, please?

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.767
You, too, Sparky.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.483
My first patrol as a Jolly Wrench
was at Glendal Canal.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:09.088
My squadron was all rookies.
All razor sharp.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:10.727
<i>I should know.</i>

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.366
<i>I trained every single one of them.</i>

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:17.081
<i>It was supposed to be a routine patrol.
A milk run.</i>

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.439
Look, Skipper, enemy ship
two o'clock low, two miles.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.399
- Easy pickings. What do you say?
- Negative, Jigsaw Two.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.483
Our orders are to recon
and report back.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.648
Come on, Skip, it will be a turkey shoot.

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.959
- Let's do it, Skipper.
- Yeah, come on!

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.122
All right. Let's go in for a closer look.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.523
But keep your distance.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.568
Holy Cow! It's the whole enemy fleet!

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.285
<i>It was too late to pull up.</i>

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.283
Get out of there, Lucas!

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.881
<i>My whole squadron.</i>

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.641
Under my command.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:35.931
After that, I just couldn't
bring myself to fly again.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.842
Let me ask you something, Dusty.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.402
If you knew the truth about my past,

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.490
would you have asked me to train you?

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.804
No.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.762
I'm sorry, Dusty.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.765
Dusty?

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.959
Can you believe it?

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.964
He hasn't been straight with me
this whole time.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.282
At least you were honest.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.647
You said I wasn't built for this.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.799
I guess I should
have listened to you.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:36.601
Dusty, if you had listened to me
I would never ever forgive myself.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.566
Look, the Skipper may have
been wrong for what he did,

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.163
but he was right about you.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:47.443
You're not a crop duster. You're a racer.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:48.886
And now

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.010
the whole world knows it.

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:04.008
Thanks, Dottie.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.368
That means a lot.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:11.328
I've gone as far as I can go.
I'm busted up, look at me.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.727
Yes, look at you.

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:24.291
Dusty, I cannot bear the thought
of competing without you.

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:28.081
Hey, that's the wing
of a T-33 Shooting Star.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.163
When the great Mexican Air Force
needed help,

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:35.729
American T-33s came.
They did not ask questions.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.804
They did not hesitate. They were there.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:42.247
Because that is what <i>compadres</i> do.

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:43.526
And what's that?

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.290
That is my lunch. Don't touch.

01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:48.171
But the wings are yours.

01:08:48.439 --> 01:08:50.283
El Chu, I really appreciate...

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.520
<i>Silencio.</i>

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.691
After all, you helped me
with my pursuits of the heart.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.490
Now we are here to help you.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.850
- We?
<i>- Oui.</i>

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:06.251
Good luck tomorrow, Dusty.
I am so proud to compete with you.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:10.450
You're a good egg, Dusty.
Look, here's a sat-nav device.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.886
Just in case...

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.447
In case you ever find yourself
lost, you know, without a...

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.649
Without a friend to help you through it.

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.366
Thank you, Bulldog.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.330
Here's a flow control valve for you.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:27.451
How about a starter generator?

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.086
It is honor to fly beside you.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.640
Thanks, everyone. Really.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.688
This is fantastic.

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.080
Looks like all you need now is a...

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.604
A new propeller?

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.491
How about a Sky Slycer Mark Five?

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.002
Wait, that's your propeller.
You could still win the race.

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:49.648
Oh, I intend to, but with my old propeller.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.849
This one didn't really suit me.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.522
But I think you
will have a lot better luck with it.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.930
Thanks, Ishani.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.479
Dottie, can you fix me?

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:05.280
Does a PT6A
have a multi-stage compressor?

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.051
Uh...

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.929
Yes! Yes it does.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.566
All right, you guys,
let's get him ready to race.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.920
<i>This one's...</i>

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.041
What?

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:30.801
Hmm.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.562
<i>We are live from Mexico.
And here they come.</i>

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.924
This is it, race fans.
The final leg back to New York.

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.201
Whoa, dude!

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.839
- We'll see you in New York.
- Thanks, guys.

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.325
It's dustin' time!

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.851
Dusty <i>la vista,</i> baby!

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.651
You gotta hand it to him.
He never gives up.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.689
Come on, Chug,
we have a jet to catch.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.844
New York City.
Finish line, here we come!

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.162
Hey. So are you ready to go, Skip?

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.799
Probably best if I don't.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:17.801
What...

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.519
Oh. Okay.

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.522
Are you sure?

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.204
Yeah.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.009
- Dusty!
- He's back.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.207
You got to be kidding me.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.209
- Who's that guy?
- It's the crop duster.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.039
- Another one?
- It's the same one, Knucklehead.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.246
Move aside, idiots.

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:51.919
Bolting on a few new parts
doesn't change who you are.

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:54.526
I can still
smell the farm on you.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.090
You know what? I finally get it.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:04.211
You're afraid of
getting beat by a crop duster.

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.250
Well, check six, because I'm coming.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.931
And what are you punks looking at?

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.570
- Nothing. Nothing.
- Sorry.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:19.890
We are going to end this,
once and for all.

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.239
- Yeah, man.
- This is going to be fun.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:30.399
<i>This one's all about speed
and the willingness to give it all.</i>

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:35.247
<i>First to cut the ribbon in New York
takes home the trophy and the glory.</i>

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:36.841
Ya!

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.726
<i>And we're off
as the first flyers take to the air.</i>

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.287
I will wait for you
at the finish line, <i>hermosa.</i>

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:47.011
No, no, no. I will be waiting for you.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.529
Ya!

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.647
<i>The rest of the field
is now off and running.</i>

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.121
<i>And though Crophopper did not
complete the previous leg,</i>

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:08.489
<i>race officials ruled his radio
had been tampered with.</i>

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.880
<i>So he'll be allowed to compete.</i>

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:12.681
<i>But with a severe time penalty.</i>

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:32.326
<i>I've never seen someone come
back from this far behind.</i>

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:35.039
<i>It's going to take both
horsepower and willpower</i>

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.280
<i>to even have a chance.</i>

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.162
Good show, Dusty.

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.522
- Um, boss?
- What?

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.041
He's here.

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:22.083
Okay, we're out of camera range.

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.009
You know what to do.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:35.847
Hey, farmer.
Time to plow the fields.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.999
Looks like you've run out of airspace,
Crophopper.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.127
Hey!

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.920
- Skipper? Whoa!
<i>- Dusty, pull up!</i>

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.368
Skipper? You're flying!

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.521
<i>Oh, you noticed.</i>

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.919
<i>Listen, I got Rip.
You take care of the other two.</i>

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.921
Got it.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.441
They're on your six, kid.
You gotta lose them.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.886
I'm trying.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.770
Skip, I can't shake them.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.122
Pull hard right.
I'll break left and take out Rip.

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.527
- Use the rocks.
- Roger that!

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.370
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.286
Yeah!

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.767
Oh, that's going to
leave a mark.

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.245
What?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.651
Say hello to the Warsaw Windmill.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.007
Whoa! You're crazy!
That's right.

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:50.967
- Dusty! Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.003
That was pretty good for a crop duster.

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:56.768
And not bad for
an old-timer who doesn't fly.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.642
Oh, yeah? Well, I may be old,
but at least I ain't afraid of heights.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.165
Oh, okay.

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:06.721
No!

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.450
That's why they call them Sky Slycers!

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.049
Oh, no. Skipper, are you okay?

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.844
Are you kidding?
I'm great.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.239
- But what about your tail?
- I'll live. Go get them!

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.730
Go!

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.210
<i>We're closing in
on the final stretch, folks.</i>

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:32.839
<i>That's right, Colin.</i>

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.800
<i>And ever since they emerged
from Deadstick Desert,</i>

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.482
<i>Ripslinger has maintained a lead.</i>

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.531
Any sign of them?

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.201
Nothing yet.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:03.201
- What?
- Hi.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.485
Come on, come on, come on.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.005
Not now! Not now!

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.770
Come on, come on, come on.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.450
No!

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.200
<i>Tailwinds like
nothing you've ever flown.</i>

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.730
Roger that, Skip.

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.206
Don't look down. Don't look down.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.570
Oh, yeah!

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:27.283
Okay, time to eat my dust.

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:32.400
With another win for Ripslinger
seeming inevitable...

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.159
Wait a second, it's Dusty Crophopper!

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.810
- Yes!
- Go!

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.483
<i>And here they come,
down the stretch.</i>

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.049
<i>It's going to be close,
it's anyone's race.</i>

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.607
All right, get my good side, fellas.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.001
What?

01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.009
Yes!

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.322
<i>He's done it! He's done it.</i>

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.489
Crophopper!

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:05.920
No!

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.241
What?

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.683
<i>From last to first.</i>

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.410
<i>From obscurity to immortality,</i>

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.039
<i>the racing world
will never forget this day.</i>

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.959
<i>For the first time, a crop duster</i>

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.008
<i>has won the
Wings Around the Globe Rally!</i>

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:20.850
Yes, Dusty! Ha-ha!

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.801
<i>Magnifique, Dusty!</i>

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.361
You really kicked his bottom, lad!

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.527
All right. Yeah! Now that's how to pass!

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.761
You did it!

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.649
I couldn't have done it
without you, Dottie.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:39.002
Yeah, I know.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.682
Hey, buddy, great tip about Ripslinger
leaning to the cameras. Thanks, Chug.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.609
Hey, anything for my pal.

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:49.203
Well done, Dusty.
The world has a new champion.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:50.850
And so do I.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.771
Thanks, Ishani. For everything.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:55.879
<i>- Herr Dusty!</i>
- Franz?

01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:57.199
- Hoorah!
- What are you doing here?

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:01.046
We came to watch you win the race.
You are an inspiration to all of us.

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:02.287
"All of us"?

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:07.201
Yeah. All of us who want to do more
than just what we were built for.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.967
Whoa! Thanks, guys!

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.201
Whoo-wee!

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.688
Ripstinker. Yeah, that's your name.
That's some supersonic sewer sauce.

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.840
Man, I thought
Vita-stink-a-bunch was bad.

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.809
That's got nothing on you.

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.686
Ooh! You're just nasty. Nastilicious.

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:25.564
You need to go home and wash up.

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.131
Twice.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.599
Whoa!

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.568
Who's that guy?

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:01.886
Thanks, Skip.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.161
Don't thank me.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:08.284
I learned a lot more from you
than you ever learned from me.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.245
Attention on deck. Victory!

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.486
Victory!

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.121
It's an honor to be here.

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.241
Hook them up.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.170
- You ready, wingman?
- Roger that.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.366
An honorary Jolly Wrench.
How's that feel, Dusty?

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:06.521
It feels great!

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.200
Back in the saddle again,
eh, Skipper?

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:12.199
Well, they didn't have these fancy toys
the last time I did this.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:13.519
Nothing to it.

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:16.000
They hook you up,
you nod to the shooter over there,

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.247
and hang on!

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.524
Yeah!

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.439
Last one back to Propwash buys!

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:39.839
Ha-ha! You're on!
