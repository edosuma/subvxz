WEBVTT

00:32.120 --> 00:34.800
You ugly sons of bitches want a fight?

00:34.840 --> 00:36.320
You got one.

00:48.640 --> 00:52.640
Cut! Cut! Cut.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.320
We're doing another take, right?

00:54.360 --> 00:56.040
I'm not happy with the camera blocking.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.480
Tell me, Carl, when are you ever completely happy?

00:58.520 --> 01:00.280
At the end of the day with a pint in my hand.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.360
Okay, everyone, we're going to have one more rehearsal,

01:02.400 --> 01:04.320
then we're going to go for a take.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.120
-Thanks! -No probs.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.600
Susie, tea, please. Milk, two sugars.

01:08.640 --> 01:09.880
Milk, two sugars.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.760
-No probs.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.280
Carl, I don't mind rehearsing.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.280
Lexi, we have a stand-in for a reason.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.280
You go and rest up.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.320
Anyone would think you didn't want me around.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.200
Maybe give you a chance to learn your lines.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.360
Chance'd be a bloody fine thing.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.440
-Yep. Good, okay.

01:46.480 --> 01:48.320
You run up this street here...

01:48.360 --> 01:49.800
Dead end.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.720
-Okay. Got it.

01:51.760 --> 01:54.560
Nice one. Okay, everyone, let's get this show

01:51.760 --> 01:54.560
on the road!

01:54.600 --> 01:58.800
LEXI: Those things, those monsters, they don't

01:54.600 --> 01:58.800
care about our future.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.800
They'll just... They don't care about our future,

02:01.840 --> 02:05.920
they'll just keep going, they'll just...

02:01.840 --> 02:05.920
They'll just...

02:07.680 --> 02:10.280
How are the rewrites going?

02:10.320 --> 02:15.880
Slow and agonisingly painful. Like root canal surgery.

02:15.920 --> 02:19.240
Always so upbeat, Arnie. It'll be worth it in the end.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.840
Action.

02:30.320 --> 02:33.160
Those things, those monsters,

02:33.200 --> 02:36.040
they don't care about our future,

02:36.080 --> 02:37.920
they'll just... They'll just...

02:37.960 --> 02:39.920
Keep devouring us.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.320
Keep devouring us and they won't stop until we're dead.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.640
Milk, one sugar.

02:45.680 --> 02:49.200
-I asked for milk, two sugars. -Oh, I'm sorry.

02:45.680 --> 02:49.200
I'm such an idiot.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.840
And this is coffee, not tea.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.840
Tea, milk, one sugar.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.480
-Two sugars. -Two sugars!

03:01.800 --> 03:04.400
The day she's satisfied is the day she dies.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.000
That's it! Good. Nice.

03:18.120 --> 03:21.280
You ugly sons of bitches...

03:21.320 --> 03:24.120
Don't worry, keep going. Keep going.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.080
Thea?

03:31.600 --> 03:34.440
-Can somebody

03:31.600 --> 03:34.440
get some water?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.120
Thea?

03:40.520 --> 03:44.640
Something's wrong! Call an ambulance! Quickly!

03:44.680 --> 03:49.800
Thea, can you hear me Thea!

04:38.480 --> 04:39.480
Whoa!

04:42.320 --> 04:43.360
Ah!

04:49.240 --> 04:54.480
"Always read the instructions, Harry."

04:49.240 --> 04:54.480
Sally drummed it into me.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.600
Ever since the great shelving collapse of 2003.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.080
Who needs instructions

05:02.120 --> 05:08.440
So we plough on regardless, and invariably

05:02.120 --> 05:08.440
end up bleeding.

05:10.280 --> 05:13.480
Not entirely unlike my marriage, it seems.

05:13.520 --> 05:17.240
Though I can't really put a sticking

05:13.520 --> 05:17.240
plaster on that, can I?

05:17.280 --> 05:18.520
Right!

05:20.080 --> 05:21.800
Get rid of this!

05:25.760 --> 05:28.960
"Do not cut the excess rope."

05:29.000 --> 05:30.080
Ah.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.080
Camille!

05:38.560 --> 05:40.720
No, just doing a spot of DIY.

05:40.760 --> 05:42.120
You do DIY?

05:42.160 --> 05:45.200
I potter. I dabble. I tinker.

05:45.240 --> 05:48.640
-You don't strike me as the DIY type.

05:48.680 --> 05:52.120
Two reasons. One, you use words

05:48.680 --> 05:52.120
like "tinker". And two...

05:52.160 --> 05:53.640
Bit of a ruckus with an A-frame.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.240
Mmm-hmm. I think the A-frame won.

05:59.400 --> 06:03.280
Thea Homes, stand-in on a movie set, 27.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.920
She collapsed during rehearsal.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.320
She was unconscious, but still had a pulse.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.480
She was sweating badly. Her pupils were

06:07.360 --> 06:10.480
fixed and dilated.

06:10.520 --> 06:13.320
-For a short while, yes.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.080
But then her heart stopped.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.440
HUMPHREY: Something must have caused

06:15.120 --> 06:17.440
the paralysis of the muscles.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.200
Here, look. Lack of oxygen to the skin.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.840
HUMPHREY: Respiratory failure? CAMILLE: The lips

06:22.240 --> 06:25.840
are also blue.

06:25.880 --> 06:29.680
She was poisoned. By something extremely toxic.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.720
Do we know what she's had to eat

06:29.720 --> 06:31.720
or drink this morning?

06:31.760 --> 06:35.360
No, we don't, but all food is served back at the film base.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.080
Cast and crew have all their meals on set.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.360
They get brought from the hotel at 6:00.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.920
Breakfast hadn't been served yet,

06:48.960 --> 06:51.480
but there were drinks and snacks available.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.520
People have been in and out all day. Thea included.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.840
-Nope, no-one.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.440
-50. Or thereabouts.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.120
HUMPHREY: Chocolates, coffee, fruit.

07:11.040 --> 07:14.440
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

07:15.720 --> 07:16.760
Hmm.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.840
Dwayne, would you mind getting everything bagged up

07:19.880 --> 07:22.200
and sent for testing? And check where

07:19.880 --> 07:22.200
Thea was staying,

07:22.240 --> 07:24.320
-search her room. -I'll get my things.

07:24.360 --> 07:28.680
Why would anyone want to kill a lowly stand

07:28.720 --> 07:31.240
CARL: Thea, she was a sweet girl. Quiet.

07:28.720 --> 07:31.240
Always did what she was told,

07:31.280 --> 07:32.760
she makes my job a hell of a lot easier.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.960
Can you think of any reason why someone

07:32.800 --> 07:34.960
might want to kill her?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.840
-None at all. -Did she have any friends,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.840
acquaintances?

07:39.240 --> 07:41.160
Lexi Cunningham, she's our lead actress.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.920
Her and Thea were pals from school.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.640
Oh, they were close?

07:44.680 --> 07:47.600
Yeah, thick as thieves. Lexi's the reason

07:44.680 --> 07:47.600
Thea's out here.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.160
Got her the job.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.720
<i>They were pretty</i> <i>much inseparable.</i>

07:51.760 --> 07:52.960
You must be starving.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.760
Ah, you angel. I'll pay you back.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.240
No, no, it's all right. I'll put it on the tab.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.920
I got the impression that Lexi felt sorry for her.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.320
-Just the way

07:58.960 --> 08:01.320
she was with Thea.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.680
You know, protective. Always looking out for her.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.560
Ask her yourself, she's over there.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.440
CAMILLE: Thank you.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.880
LEXI: We used to play out on our bikes all the time.

08:15.920 --> 08:21.000
We were best friends, right up until I went

08:15.920 --> 08:21.000
off to drama school.

08:21.040 --> 08:24.440
We kept in touch, but she got in with a bad crowd.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.000
Drinking and drugs.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.840
Few years later, I'm on tour with this awful play

08:28.880 --> 08:31.920
and I get a call in the middle of the night.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.120
She'd been arrested.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.960
Arrested

08:35.000 --> 08:39.320
Mugging. It went wrong. A man died.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.840
One stupid moment, and her whole life changed.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.080
She got out a few months back.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.680
HUMPHREY: <i>And she came all the way</i>

08:49.120 --> 08:51.680
<i>to the Caribbean to see you?</i>

08:51.720 --> 08:56.600
LEXI: <i> I just figured</i> <i>she deserved a break.</i>

08:51.720 --> 08:56.600
<i>It's my fault, isn't it?</i>

08:56.640 --> 08:58.600
It's my fault she was out here.

09:02.320 --> 09:06.680
A stand-in is killed after only

09:02.320 --> 09:06.680
a few weeks on a film set.

09:07.760 --> 09:11.480
She's well liked, quiet. Why?

09:11.520 --> 09:13.960
She went to prison. Maybe it has

09:11.520 --> 09:13.960
to do with her past.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.360
Yes, if we could get a copy of Thea's criminal record...

09:16.400 --> 09:18.600
Yes... Oh, sir!

09:18.640 --> 09:19.920
No harm done.

09:27.880 --> 09:29.080
Would you like me to start interviewing?

09:29.120 --> 09:31.720
If you would, Fidel.

09:31.760 --> 09:34.160
About time we broke the news to her family.

09:43.400 --> 09:47.840
I'm truly sorry for your loss, Mrs Homes. Yes, absolutely.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.640
We'll be in touch. Bye-bye.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.520
How did she take it?

09:55.560 --> 09:59.160
Cool as a cucumber. Rather reluctant

09:55.560 --> 09:59.160
to talk about her daughter.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.440
Haven't spoken since she went to prison.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.520
-FIDEL: Not much.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.400
-Wow, she travelled light. -Mmm.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.200
-It seems like she didn't intend to stay long.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.200
-Mmm.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.600
Respiratory failure from eight milligrams

10:14.880 --> 10:17.600
of tetrodotoxin.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.320
-Yes! -The effects take

10:19.800 --> 10:22.320
a while to kick in.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.840
They estimate that she was poisoned

10:22.360 --> 10:25.840
around an hour before.

10:25.880 --> 10:29.840
She had to have been poisoned on set. Anything else of note?

10:29.880 --> 10:33.560
The only food in her stomach was

10:29.880 --> 10:33.560
a small amount of chocolate.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.040
Chocolate and cherry.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.920
The chocolates from the food tent.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.920
They were poisoned?

10:37.960 --> 10:43.040
Nonsense! Rather, it makes no sense. All of

10:37.960 --> 10:43.040
the chocolates were eaten,

10:43.080 --> 10:44.600
yet no-one else died.

10:44.640 --> 10:48.560
So, it seems that only one from

10:44.640 --> 10:48.560
the entire box was poisoned.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.320
Just the one Thea ate.

10:50.360 --> 10:53.240
Yes, just that one.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.760
-One question. -Yes.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.120
Who put those chocolates there,

11:00.800 --> 11:03.120
to what end,

11:03.160 --> 11:05.840
and why only one poisoned chocolate?

11:05.880 --> 11:08.000
That's three questions.

11:08.040 --> 11:11.120
HUMPHREY: If you are only going to poison one chocolate

11:08.040 --> 11:11.120
in a box of 20,

11:11.160 --> 11:12.840
why choose the cherry?

11:12.880 --> 11:15.360
CAMILLE: Maybe the killer knew cherry was

11:12.880 --> 11:15.360
Thea's favourite?

11:15.400 --> 11:19.160
HUMPHREY: Bit risky, though, anyone could have eaten it.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.480
Hook-a-duck.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.320
Every summer when I was growing up,

11:32.360 --> 11:34.400
a funfair would pitch up on the village green.

11:34.440 --> 11:37.920
There'd be a carousel and a ghost train and a hook-a-duck.

11:37.960 --> 11:41.200
It's those little rubber ducks bobbing around

11:37.960 --> 11:41.200
on a paddling pool.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.400
You had to try and hook them with a little

11:41.240 --> 11:44.400
fishing rod and if you got

11:44.440 --> 11:48.000
the one with the star on its bottom, you won

11:44.440 --> 11:48.000
the most fantastic prize.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.200
-A goldfish.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.640
-A goldfish. -In a plastic bag.

11:52.680 --> 11:55.080
You had a very dull childhood, didn't you?

11:57.160 --> 11:59.240
Not once.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.880
How is that at all relevant?

12:01.920 --> 12:04.920
Probability. See, the odds were stacked against me.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.640
As are the odds stacked against the murderer

12:06.680 --> 12:09.960
killing his intended victim. There's too much

12:06.680 --> 12:09.960
chance involved.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.240
-Thea could've eaten any chocolate.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.240
-Precisely.

12:13.280 --> 12:16.720
Mr Collins. Sorry to bother you.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.320
Your catering. Who provides it?

12:18.360 --> 12:21.720
Uh, we hire a local company. They do everything.

12:21.760 --> 12:22.800
Oh.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.560
-Perfect, thanks, Susie. -No probs.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.760
-Did they provide

12:28.040 --> 12:29.760
you with those

12:29.800 --> 12:31.560
rather expensive

12:31.600 --> 12:34.000
No. I put them out. When I arrived this morning

12:31.600 --> 12:34.000
around 6:00, they were

12:34.040 --> 12:36.720
outside Lexi's tent. Lexi arrived just as I did.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.280
These must be for you.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.720
Oh, why do they do this to me? Take them, seriously,

12:41.760 --> 12:43.320
or I'll eat the lot.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.120
CARL: <i> The production company</i> <i>send her gifts all the time.</i>

12:45.160 --> 12:47.160
She didn't want the temptation,

12:45.160 --> 12:47.160
so I put them out

12:47.200 --> 12:49.640
for everyone to share. The crew are like gannets.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.640
They'll eat anything.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.920
Sorry, just to clarify.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.680
-No.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.640
-In her tent.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.360
Sorry, have I missed something?

13:02.400 --> 13:04.880
-Thea was never the intended victim.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.880
-Lexi Cunningham was.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.240
-Yeah, 24/7.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.520
Check with security, see if they can

13:08.560 --> 13:10.920
shed any light on when those chocolates came.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.000
You're kidding.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.320
You're not kidding.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.320
I thought they were from production.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.440
One minute they're telling me I'm putting on

13:19.360 --> 13:21.440
too much weight,

13:21.480 --> 13:25.120
and the next, they're sending me chocolates.

13:21.480 --> 13:25.120
They were poisoned?

13:25.160 --> 13:29.760
Only one. May I ask, which would be

13:25.160 --> 13:29.760
your first choice?

13:32.440 --> 13:33.440
The cherry one.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.720
That was the one, wasn't it?

13:37.760 --> 13:41.920
Forgive me, but is there anyone you can imagine

13:37.760 --> 13:41.920
who'd want to harm you?

13:41.960 --> 13:44.920
-No. -So you haven't felt

13:41.960 --> 13:44.920
threatened by anyone?

13:47.320 --> 13:48.960
Well, that was just me being paranoid.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.960
We came back from filming, my door was open...

13:51.640 --> 13:53.320
CARL: Did you lock up?

13:54.520 --> 13:56.960
Yeah, I'm sure I did.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.120
LEXI: <i> Some of my things</i> <i>had been moved around.</i>

14:00.160 --> 14:02.440
HUMPHREY: <i> Was</i> <i>anything missing?</i>

14:00.160 --> 14:02.440
LEXI: <i> Nothing.</i>

14:02.480 --> 14:04.640
At first, I thought it was the maid having

14:02.480 --> 14:04.640
a bit of a nose,

14:04.680 --> 14:06.680
but then I got freaked out.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.080
She didn't want to stay there after that,

14:06.720 --> 14:09.080
so we swapped rooms.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.400
You really mean it, don't you?

14:10.440 --> 14:12.720
You think someone's trying to kill me.

14:14.880 --> 14:18.640
The zombies are strangling the life from her...

14:24.320 --> 14:27.600
Whoever tried to kill Lexi is still out there.

14:24.320 --> 14:27.600
What if they try again?

14:27.640 --> 14:29.880
That won't happen, Mr Collins. We'll make sure of it.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.240
MAN: Carl, ready for a take.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.200
-Okay. Excuse me. -Mmm-hmm.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.680
We should get Dwayne and Fidel down here.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.320
And check with the hotel,

14:42.360 --> 14:45.240
see if we can find out who let themselves into Lexi's room.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.880
Any luck with security?

14:46.920 --> 14:49.040
All deliveries have to go there first.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.800
No box of chocolate was delivered for Lexi.

14:51.840 --> 14:55.720
-So, someone on this set put them there.

14:51.840 --> 14:55.720
-Yes.

14:55.760 --> 14:59.240
CAMILLE: <i> Carl said he saw</i> <i>the chocolate outside</i>

14:55.760 --> 14:59.240
<i>Lexi's tent at 6:00 a.m.</i>

14:59.280 --> 15:01.000
Everyone has to sign in when they arrive,

15:01.040 --> 15:03.920
but only three people were in before 6:00 yesterday.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.000
<i>Susie, the runner.</i>

15:05.040 --> 15:07.160
<i>Arnold Finch, the writer...</i>

15:07.200 --> 15:08.640
HUMPHREY: <i> And Carl Collins.</i>

15:08.680 --> 15:10.960
Mmm-hmm. Any one of them could've witnessed

15:11.000 --> 15:12.320
who put the chocolates there, or...

15:12.360 --> 15:15.520
-Or put them there themselves, yeah.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.520
-Yeah.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.560
I don't have much to do with Lexi,

15:15.560 --> 15:18.560
to be honest.

15:18.600 --> 15:22.720
I write the lines, she says them.

15:18.600 --> 15:22.720
Good actress.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.640
Little bit rough around the edges, maybe.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.680
Little bit, unpolished.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.880
But she's still honing her craft.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.680
I trust your craft is well and truly honed.

15:33.720 --> 15:36.880
I hope so. I've been doing it for 30 years.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.720
Do you know the film <i> Code Red?</i>

15:39.760 --> 15:42.400
-No. -Yes, I know it!

15:39.760 --> 15:42.400
First World War.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.160
Second. Submarine commander escaping from...

15:45.200 --> 15:47.440
Nazis!

15:47.480 --> 15:49.680
-Japanese. -Yes! I know it.

15:49.720 --> 15:52.000
That's one of mine.

15:52.040 --> 15:55.600
Zombies. Bit of a departure for you, isn't it?

15:55.640 --> 16:00.360
I suppose so. Originated in this

15:55.640 --> 16:00.360
part of the world, you know.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.200
Haiti.

16:02.240 --> 16:07.320
It's all mixed up with the history of the place,

16:02.240 --> 16:07.320
slavery and whatnot.

16:07.360 --> 16:11.000
That's why we're filming out here, it's all to do

16:07.360 --> 16:11.000
with the old myths.

16:11.040 --> 16:14.960
Yes, and, uh, you didn't see who put the chocolates

16:11.040 --> 16:14.960
outside Lexi's tent?

16:15.000 --> 16:19.880
No. I was busy, busy, busy. Always busy tapping away.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.120
Didn't see a thing.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.160
HUMPHREY: <i>How do you know Lexi?</i>

16:29.200 --> 16:31.880
I was directing my first short film, she auditioned.

16:31.920 --> 16:35.120
I was late for the meeting. She kicked off,

16:31.920 --> 16:35.120
effing and blinding.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.560
Thought she was a right little madam,

16:35.160 --> 16:37.560
to be honest, but,

16:37.600 --> 16:39.800
when she started acting, she was magic.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.080
Can she still be a little madam?

16:42.120 --> 16:45.680
She's an actress. Course.

16:45.720 --> 16:49.320
-But you like her. -Lexi's like family to me.

16:49.360 --> 16:53.800
Introduced me to my wife. Godmother to my two girls.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.880
My daughters think the world of her.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.280
You look happy.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.360
Happiest day of my life.

17:04.520 --> 17:08.840
I fetch Lexi's dry cleaning. I make her tea.

17:04.520 --> 17:08.840
Milk, one sugar.

17:08.880 --> 17:12.520
Or is it milk, two sugars

17:12.560 --> 17:14.600
So you're here to keep her happy.

17:14.640 --> 17:15.840
Basically, yeah.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.440
You hear what these actresses can be like.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.400
-All air kissing and diva strops.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.400
-Lexi's all right.

17:20.440 --> 17:24.080
She remembers my name, which is more than can

17:20.440 --> 17:24.080
be said for some people.

17:24.120 --> 17:25.760
-There we go. -Thank you.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.240
No probs. Oh!

17:31.560 --> 17:33.760
Ooh! I'm so sorry. I'm such an idiot.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.560
Not at all. Spilt milk and all that.

17:35.600 --> 17:36.680
MAN ON RADIO: <i> Susie,</i> <i>come to set, please.</i>

17:36.720 --> 17:39.080
On my way. See ya, gotta go.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.600
Mmm.

17:43.640 --> 17:47.120
-Thank goodness she's only in charge of the beverages.

17:43.640 --> 17:47.120
-Yep.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.040
Oh.

17:49.080 --> 17:53.640
Seems like no-one had a hugely convincing reason

17:49.080 --> 17:53.640
to want to kill her.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.840
-Someone's hiding something. -Someone's always

17:53.680 --> 17:56.840
hiding something.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.400
Yes. <i> Code Red.</i> How long ago was that?

17:59.440 --> 18:03.280
See what we can unearth about Mr Finch's illustrious career.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.840
-Hello, Fidel.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.640
Someone on this set wants Lexi Cunningham dead.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.160
-Until we know who, she'll need a bodyguard.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.160
-Not a problem.

18:12.360 --> 18:15.480
-I'm delegating.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.840
Oh, well, I'm going out tonight.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.840
With a woman. An attractive,

18:17.880 --> 18:20.200
intelligent woman at that.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.400
And she likes you?

18:22.840 --> 18:25.160
-Give me one good reason why you shouldn't do it.

18:22.840 --> 18:25.160
-Dwayne!

18:25.200 --> 18:26.800
-I can give you three.

18:26.840 --> 18:27.880
Go on, then!

18:29.880 --> 18:33.360
Oh, I see! You owe me, Fidel.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.560
Hey, I heard that!

18:40.360 --> 18:42.320
So, a stand-in,

18:42.360 --> 18:44.800
our unfortunate and unintended victim...

18:44.840 --> 18:46.680
-Uh, sir... -I saw it.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.120
-No, no... -Eats the cherry cream...

18:49.160 --> 18:51.240
-No, no, sir... -No, sir, please...

18:54.160 --> 18:57.760
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!

18:57.800 --> 19:00.920
Sorry, sorry. As you were.

19:00.960 --> 19:04.240
Excellent make-up, by the way. Very convincing.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.560
HUMPHREY: Embittered writer and disorganised runner.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.360
Not very convincing suspects, are they?

19:22.400 --> 19:24.240
The director?

19:24.280 --> 19:26.240
Seems he would have had more to lose than he gained

19:26.280 --> 19:29.320
if Lexi was the real target. The filming would be finished.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.520
Well. Good night, sir.

19:32.560 --> 19:36.120
Ah, er, well, hang on a sec. I'll be right with you.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.840
I thought you'd be rushing home

19:36.160 --> 19:38.840
to finish your DIY.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.440
Oh, yes. Forgot about that.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.520
Um...

19:43.440 --> 19:45.640
How are you with hammocks?

19:45.680 --> 19:47.240
Hammocks?

19:47.280 --> 19:50.200
Yes. Ever managed to put one up without

19:47.280 --> 19:50.200
nearly severing a limb?

19:50.240 --> 19:52.320
Oh, that's what you've been fighting with.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.320
Yes, well, I wouldn't say "fight," exactly.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.280
That implies I have some chance of winning.

19:56.320 --> 20:00.480
Mmm. You should make sure you finish it before

19:56.320 --> 20:00.480
your wife comes tomorrow.

20:00.520 --> 20:03.680
-Your wife.

20:00.520 --> 20:03.680
She arrives tomorrow.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.520
Yes. Of course. Absolutely.

20:05.560 --> 20:07.160
You hadn't forgotten?

20:07.200 --> 20:09.720
Camille, would I forget something like that?

20:09.760 --> 20:13.520
Uh... I'm thinking probably yes.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.880
Ah, yes, ah, thank you. Of course.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.600
You must be excited to see her.

20:19.640 --> 20:22.160
Yes. Uh, I miss her very much.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.440
So she's on the 1:00 flight?

20:24.480 --> 20:26.440
Um, well, I don't know exactly...

20:26.480 --> 20:28.400
It's the only flight from London tomorrow.

20:28.440 --> 20:30.000
Is it? Well, that'll be the one, then.

20:30.040 --> 20:33.040
-Yes. -Yes. Yes. Um...

20:34.640 --> 20:37.800
Camille, the thing is, uh, about Sally...

20:37.840 --> 20:39.320
Oh, don't worry, I know.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.840
You do?

20:41.880 --> 20:44.160
Yes! You'll need to take some time off

20:41.880 --> 20:44.160
when she gets here,

20:44.200 --> 20:46.280
-help her settle in and... -Well...

20:46.320 --> 20:47.720
-Well, it's no problem. -No!

20:47.760 --> 20:49.760
-We can cope a day or two... -Well, I...

20:49.800 --> 20:52.160
You know what? In fact, let's make sure

20:49.800 --> 20:52.160
we catch our killer

20:52.200 --> 20:55.680
before she even gets here, you can take as long

20:52.200 --> 20:55.680
as you need.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.160
Yes.

20:58.200 --> 21:01.000
Uh, no, you go. I'll lock up.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.040
Okay.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.000
Good night, sir.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.160
Night, Camille.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.000
Such a mess.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.680
HUMPHREY: Okay, let's recap.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.760
-Thea Homes... -Unluckily deceased.

21:28.560 --> 21:31.040
From eating poison intended for

21:28.560 --> 21:31.040
Lexi Cunningham...

21:31.080 --> 21:33.360
Luckily not deceased.

21:33.400 --> 21:34.880
And three potential suspects...

21:34.920 --> 21:37.040
All of whom had opportunity to place

21:34.920 --> 21:37.040
the poisoned chocolates

21:37.080 --> 21:39.800
outside her tent...

21:39.840 --> 21:43.960
Sorry, interrupting. Annoying habit of mine.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.040
Another one?

21:45.080 --> 21:47.000
Yes, hard to believe, isn't it?

21:47.040 --> 21:48.680
Background on Lexi.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.480
Oh, anything interesting?

21:50.520 --> 21:53.560
Twenty-seven years old. Grew up on an estate

21:50.520 --> 21:53.560
in Stockwell, London.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.520
Acted on stage. Short films. Did a fair bit of TV.

21:56.560 --> 21:59.320
-But this film's her big break.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.840
No nasty skeletons in any murky cupboards?

22:01.880 --> 22:03.720
She was rebellious.

22:03.760 --> 22:05.960
She was suspended for smoking on school

22:03.760 --> 22:05.960
grounds at the age of 16.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.240
But that all changed in 2004.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.160
That was the same year she went to drama school.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.520
She knuckled down. Became the top of her class.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.080
What about our suspects?

22:14.120 --> 22:16.440
-Carl Collins. Family man... -Wife, two kids.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.760
He and Lexi Cunningham worked together on

22:20.040 --> 22:22.760
numerous occasions.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.280
They know each other well.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.320
Well enough to know she favours a cherry creme?

22:24.320 --> 22:26.320
Sorry!

22:27.120 --> 22:28.360
Possibly.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.120
Successful director, um, TV shows and the like,

22:31.160 --> 22:33.120
but this movie is a whole other level.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.520
There's already talk of a sequel.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.640
-Susie Jenkins. -Nothing much to report.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.960
She studied stage management, graduated two years ago.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.720
Been working on film sets ever since.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.400
CAMILLE: And Arnold Finch.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.920
Yes, what did we find out about his career?

22:44.960 --> 22:48.920
Well, he's been working since the '80s.

22:44.960 --> 22:48.920
Written dozens of films.

22:48.960 --> 22:52.640
Thought as much. <i> Code Red</i> was nearly 10 years ago.

22:52.680 --> 22:56.640
Hasn't done so much recently. Looks like

22:52.680 --> 22:56.640
the work's drying up.

22:56.680 --> 23:00.400
So far, none of them has a particularly

22:56.680 --> 23:00.400
convincing motive.

23:00.440 --> 23:03.400
Let's keep digging, financial checks, e-mail correspondence,

23:03.440 --> 23:05.600
-phone records. -Yeah, of course.

23:07.240 --> 23:11.280
Puffer fish. Why puffer fish?

23:11.320 --> 23:14.560
Zombies. It's how it all started.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.080
The people ate the puffer fish.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.520
They fell into a coma so deep, it looked like they were dead.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.680
Then they were buried and they suddenly

23:18.560 --> 23:20.680
came back to life.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.400
Yes, but why something so extraordinary?

23:22.440 --> 23:25.000
Why not rat poison or arsenic?

23:25.040 --> 23:26.840
Well, maybe the killer's trying to tell us something.

23:26.880 --> 23:29.840
Or maybe that's the only poison

23:26.880 --> 23:29.840
he could get hold of.

23:29.880 --> 23:32.160
You can buy it on the island, if you ask the right people.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.400
How do we track down these right people?

23:37.080 --> 23:38.520
-Dwayne. -CAMILLE: Dwayne.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.200
Oh, gosh, man! Come on.

23:47.240 --> 23:50.240
All right. I know exactly who you need to speak to.

23:50.280 --> 23:51.960
Who?

23:52.000 --> 23:56.520
Big Dave. He's your guy. Works on the fish market.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.200
If anyone knows who's selling puffer fish poison, it's him.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.400
Thanks. I owe you.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.920
But he won't tell you anything unless you pay.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.880
I don't pay for information. Okay?

24:09.920 --> 24:13.080
-It's bribery.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.320
I prefer to think of it as my way of saying thank you.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.720
It's still bribery.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.440
Keep 'em peeled.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.240
Is everything okay?

24:26.280 --> 24:28.920
Oh, um, my boss.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.360
He gets a promotion and loses his sense of humour.

24:33.600 --> 24:38.000
Just relax. I'm not going to let

24:33.600 --> 24:38.000
anything happen to you.

24:38.040 --> 24:40.920
I've been trying to learn the same lines

24:38.040 --> 24:40.920
for an hour now.

24:40.960 --> 24:43.160
I could read them with you, if you like.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.560
I did a bit of acting at school.

24:44.600 --> 24:48.160
Gave the best Angel Gabriel you've ever seen.

24:48.200 --> 24:53.800
"Behold, I bring tidings and great joy."

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
If you don't mind. It's just this page.

24:58.040 --> 24:59.600
-From the top.

25:01.240 --> 25:04.080
"We've got to get out of here, Lisa, before they find us."

25:06.640 --> 25:10.640
Yeah. "But, uh, where are we going to go?

25:06.640 --> 25:10.640
They're everywhere.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.720
"We're going to die, aren't we?"

25:14.800 --> 25:17.520
Oh, that was really good, too.

25:20.080 --> 25:23.680
"We're not going to die. I promise you that."

25:27.600 --> 25:28.840
-Yeah.

25:36.440 --> 25:38.920
Okay, then.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.960
You, you're going to protect me, are you?

25:41.000 --> 25:45.520
"Zombie". Comes from the Haitian "Zonbi"

25:45.560 --> 25:48.520
and the Mbundu "Nzumbe".

25:49.920 --> 25:52.560
-Fascinating. -Mmm. Nzumbe.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.680
I spoke to the production company,

25:57.640 --> 26:00.680
they're very keen to help.

26:00.720 --> 26:04.960
Gave us access to company e-mails.

26:00.720 --> 26:04.960
And this is Arnold Finch's,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.360
asking some very interesting questions.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.360
-Dr Parr. -Mmm-hmm.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.360
He's a forensic pathologist.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.840
"...researching a film

26:11.880 --> 26:14.720
"looking for information on puffer fish poison,

26:14.760 --> 26:16.880
"specifically its toxicity."

26:18.400 --> 26:21.760
-Looks like Mr Finch has some explaining to do.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.760
-Yes.

26:23.800 --> 26:26.440
It's a forum for writers. Looks like they use it

26:23.800 --> 26:26.440
to moan about things.

26:26.480 --> 26:29.760
-Jobs they've got. Jobs they haven't got.

26:26.480 --> 26:29.760
-Actresses they hate.

26:29.800 --> 26:32.840
"My advice to you is to never work with this woman.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.680
"I spend all my time thinking up

26:34.720 --> 26:39.320
"new and interesting ways to get rid of her."

26:40.280 --> 26:41.480
Crikey.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.840
I was just letting off steam.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.400
"I was thinking an assassin's bullet,

26:46.440 --> 26:49.840
"but that would be too quick and painless..."

26:49.880 --> 26:53.040
Lexi and I had a bit of a set-to.

26:53.080 --> 26:56.000
I was venting.

26:56.040 --> 26:59.880
<i>Code Red.</i> That was, um, 2004.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.960
-That's right. -Career's been downhill

26:59.920 --> 27:01.960
ever since, hasn't it?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.160
I wouldn't say that exactly.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.760
I imagine the accolades went to your head.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.800
The more money they gave you, the greedier you got.

27:06.840 --> 27:09.800
Your ego inflated. The quality of your writing

27:06.840 --> 27:09.800
took a nose dive.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.560
No-one will hire you.

27:11.600 --> 27:14.880
That is absolute nonsense. A spurious conjecture.

27:14.920 --> 27:19.240
"Why will no I wrote <i> Code Red,</i>

27:14.920 --> 27:19.240
for God's sake.

27:19.280 --> 27:24.160
"This industry is full of," expletive, expletive,

27:19.280 --> 27:24.160
"Morons."

27:24.200 --> 27:26.040
Zombies.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.440
I bloody loathe the things.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.920
It was the only offer I'd had in 18 months.

27:30.960 --> 27:33.360
Do you hate Lexi Cunningham?

27:35.280 --> 27:36.600
Hate's a strong word.

27:36.640 --> 27:38.400
You didn't answer the question.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.560
She's had it in for me from the start.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.280
Nit-picking every single line.

27:45.320 --> 27:48.680
She says, I don't know how to write for young people.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.760
Or women. She says I'm sexist.

27:50.800 --> 27:55.840
Me! Sexist! Stupid cow.

27:55.880 --> 27:59.640
According to your posts, Lexi's signed

27:55.880 --> 27:59.640
up for a sequel.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.800
On one condition, you don't write it.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.880
She is destroying your career.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.000
Perhaps killing her would solve everything.

28:08.040 --> 28:10.440
All this talk about puffer fish poisoning,

28:10.480 --> 28:12.040
it's in the script, look.

28:13.360 --> 28:19.200
Uh, scene 53. Here, read it.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.240
You must see how this looks, Mr Finch.

28:21.280 --> 28:24.280
You researching the exact poison used to try

28:24.320 --> 28:26.200
and kill Lexi Cunningham.

28:26.240 --> 28:30.640
What you have to understand is,

28:26.240 --> 28:30.640
I'm a writer.

28:30.680 --> 28:34.040
Writers don't do things, we just sit behind our laptops

28:34.080 --> 28:37.360
in our pants and make pretend people do things.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.840
We're passive-aggressive. We're...

28:41.840 --> 28:43.560
Cowards.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.280
This is not the act of a writer.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.920
Oh, no, thank you very much.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.040
No, you've been most helpful.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.560
I'm not sure what to make of Arnold Finch. He seems...

28:57.600 --> 28:59.720
-Exactly.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.560
-Ah... -I got it.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.160
-Hotel where the crew are staying.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.160
-Oh!

29:03.200 --> 29:05.160
Any idea who let themselves into Lexi's room?

29:05.200 --> 29:08.240
-No, but there was something else rather intriguing.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.000
Which was?

29:10.040 --> 29:12.240
Reception have had complaints about raised voices

29:10.040 --> 29:12.240
in Lexi's room.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.760
-No.

29:14.800 --> 29:15.920
Yeah, always the way.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.000
One guest said it sounded like a domestic.

29:18.040 --> 29:21.800
The receptionist went and knocked on Lexi's door

29:18.040 --> 29:21.800
when it got really bad.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.920
Lexi said everything was fine but seemed really scared.

29:24.960 --> 29:28.240
There was somebody else in the room with her.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.720
Carl Collins.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.240
Let's go.

29:33.280 --> 29:36.480
So who should we talk to first about this argument,

29:33.280 --> 29:36.480
Lexi or Carl?

29:36.520 --> 29:39.080
CAMILLE: Well, they're both hiding something.

29:51.800 --> 29:54.840
Excuse me, are you Big Dave?

29:54.880 --> 29:56.040
Are you calling me fat?

29:57.400 --> 29:59.880
No. Not at all.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.440
Okay.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.280
Sorry to disturb you.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.560
You looking for Big Dave?

30:08.600 --> 30:11.480
Yeah, you know where I can find him?

30:11.520 --> 30:12.680
He's right here.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.800
My wife put me on a diet. No carbs.

30:17.840 --> 30:19.880
I tell you, it's killing me.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.000
Right.

30:23.040 --> 30:25.680
Dave, tell me,

30:25.720 --> 30:28.120
what do you know about puffer fish poison?

30:28.160 --> 30:31.000
I know it's illegal, and nobody should

30:28.160 --> 30:31.000
be selling it.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.040
Okay.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.800
You know who's dealing in it?

30:36.840 --> 30:38.800
You seen anyone here trying to buy it?

30:43.480 --> 30:46.600
I can be very loose-lipped once

30:43.480 --> 30:46.600
I got some gratitude.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.880
I'm not paying.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.680
Then I'm not talking.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.240
Fine.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.400
I'll speak to someone else.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.280
Fine. You do that.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.080
Yeah, fine. I will.

31:02.560 --> 31:03.920
20 dollars!

31:05.120 --> 31:07.160
Save yourself a whole lot of time.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.040
Lexi introduced Carl to his wife.

31:16.080 --> 31:17.600
She's godmother to his daughters.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.360
Um... Is this the right way? -Yes.

31:20.400 --> 31:23.120
-But I thought we were going to the hotel to speak to Carl.

31:23.160 --> 31:24.560
Oh, yes, we are.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.560
But first we're going to the airport.

31:26.600 --> 31:29.160
To pick up your wife.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.560
No, but the thing is, well, oh, thank you.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.080
No, they're for her. You can't go empty-handed.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.440
Right, that's very thoughtful.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.160
The thing is, I think you should probably

31:42.400 --> 31:45.160
stop the car.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.040
-No, we'll be late. -It really doesn't matter.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.320
-Of course it matters! You can't be late...

31:47.080 --> 31:49.320
-Stop the car!

31:50.440 --> 31:51.640
Thank you.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.720
Her plane lands in 15 minutes.

31:59.760 --> 32:02.800
Yes, her plane gets here but she won't be on it.

32:02.840 --> 32:06.280
In fact, as such, you could hardly

32:02.840 --> 32:06.280
call it her plane, really.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.400
She's not coming?

32:26.840 --> 32:31.520
She and I, well, we're still married, obviously.

32:31.560 --> 32:34.680
-Our marital status is presently...

32:31.560 --> 32:34.680
-You've split up with her.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.560
Rather, she split up with me, so...

32:39.200 --> 32:40.920
Anyway, it's just one of those things.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.120
I'm really sorry.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.280
Bit of a shock.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.160
Although if I'm totally honest,

32:51.200 --> 32:53.360
it's probably been on the cards for a while.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.000
Doesn't make it any easier.

32:56.440 --> 33:00.400
Not sure how I'm going to muddle

32:56.440 --> 33:00.400
along without her.

33:00.440 --> 33:04.120
I'm a perfect dunce when it comes to...

33:00.440 --> 33:04.120
Well, life, really.

33:05.080 --> 33:08.800
-No, you're not. -Yes, yes, I am.

33:08.840 --> 33:11.680
I couldn't get anything right in the end.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.720
Even the little things.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.400
I'd make her a gin and tonic, ice, slice, dash of tonic,

33:16.440 --> 33:19.640
and I'd forget it had to be slim-line. Silly Humph.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.440
Couldn't even get that right.

33:23.480 --> 33:27.600
Maybe you being here, maybe it's the fresh start you need.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.640
Absolutely. New page.

33:29.680 --> 33:33.600
Clean slate. Square one and all that, yes.

33:33.640 --> 33:34.760
So, right.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.800
It's all rather awkward!

33:41.840 --> 33:44.680
-Over-sharing with a colleague.

33:41.840 --> 33:44.680
-Yeah. Not at all, you know,

33:44.720 --> 33:47.560
any time.

33:53.080 --> 33:54.800
G&amp;T.

33:54.840 --> 33:56.000
G&amp;T?

33:56.040 --> 33:59.400
G&amp;T. That's why Carl and Lexi were arguing.

33:59.440 --> 34:01.360
Lexi knew what Carl was up to.

34:01.400 --> 34:04.080
-Come on,

34:01.400 --> 34:04.080
I'll tell you on the way.

34:11.720 --> 34:13.280
CARL: Coming! Coming!

34:14.720 --> 34:17.240
Hello, uh, I'm just on the phone to London.

34:17.280 --> 34:20.840
-You'd think so,

34:17.280 --> 34:20.840
wouldn't you? But, uh, no.

34:20.880 --> 34:21.920
Sorry.

34:25.400 --> 34:28.400
You and Lexi were heard having a heated discussion.

34:28.440 --> 34:31.480
-On more than one occasion. -Well, we argue

34:28.440 --> 34:31.480
all the time, of course.

34:31.520 --> 34:33.200
That's the thing with us creative types.

34:33.240 --> 34:35.040
Ah, it's just about the film?

34:35.080 --> 34:36.960
-We want it to be a success.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.960
-Right.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.040
Excellent.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.520
Glad we cleared that up.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.040
Lovely room you've got here.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.240
Very spacious.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.200
Airy.

34:45.240 --> 34:46.960
I imagine the bathroom's fantastic.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.560
Mmm, all mod cons, is it?

34:48.600 --> 34:50.400
Power shower...

34:50.440 --> 34:53.400
Those teeny, tiny bottles of shampoo, you end up

34:50.440 --> 34:53.400
snaffling but, um,

34:53.440 --> 34:55.480
never use!

34:55.520 --> 34:57.200
No, no, don't go in there!

35:00.720 --> 35:03.160
Fresh towels, too. It's very swish.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.840
How did you know?

35:09.880 --> 35:12.080
Susie, the world's most inept tea maker,

35:12.120 --> 35:13.840
only ever gets your order right.

35:13.880 --> 35:16.440
When you love someone, you make the extra effort,

35:13.880 --> 35:16.440
don't you?

35:16.480 --> 35:19.680
-Perfect! Thanks, Susie. -No probs.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.760
You got it from a cup of tea?

35:21.800 --> 35:24.720
Sometimes it's the little things.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.640
When you're on set 12-hour days,

35:24.760 --> 35:27.640
you're away from your family

35:27.680 --> 35:31.080
and your friends. You work hard

35:27.680 --> 35:31.080
and you drink hard.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.200
Lexi introduced you to your wife.

35:33.240 --> 35:35.320
She's godmother to your children.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.080
I can't imagine she's impressed.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.000
Lexi thinks I'm a fool.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.760
Well, she doesn't understand. She doesn't know

35:39.040 --> 35:41.760
what it's like.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.600
I'm the one carrying the can here.

35:43.640 --> 35:46.880
I'm the one under pressure from the production company.

35:43.640 --> 35:46.880
From everyone!

35:46.920 --> 35:49.120
It was just nice to have a little bit of company.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.320
Sorry. I should probably just go.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.400
The arguments.

35:59.440 --> 36:00.480
They were about Susie.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.240
She was going to call my wife.

36:02.280 --> 36:05.360
Tell her! Go on, she deserves to hear it from you.

36:05.400 --> 36:08.440
Listen, put the phone down. Get off.

36:08.480 --> 36:10.720
She doesn't find out. Do you understand me?

36:10.760 --> 36:12.360
She never finds out!

36:13.800 --> 36:16.160
Maybe it's easier all round if you kept Lexi silent.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.120
I've got a lot riding on this film.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.720
I've invested my own money. There's the sequel

36:22.160 --> 36:24.720
to think about.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.640
Why would I kill the lead actress?

36:26.680 --> 36:28.440
I told you, Lexi's like a sister to me.

36:28.480 --> 36:32.040
Recent events would rather point to the contrary.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.800
-Terrible!

36:43.720 --> 36:46.720
Tell me something, have you ever been

36:43.720 --> 36:46.720
to the Honore food market?

36:50.920 --> 36:52.400
You must've been to the waterfalls?

36:52.440 --> 36:54.280
I've had one day off since I've been here.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.480
-All I've done is work and sleep.

36:58.640 --> 37:01.480
Well, um, I'll take you.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.720
You're on.

37:03.760 --> 37:04.920
All right, then!

37:08.280 --> 37:09.880
Oh, excuse me a minute.

37:11.640 --> 37:12.760
You find Big Dave?

37:12.800 --> 37:13.960
He isn't so big any more.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.520
<i>Oh, he stuck</i> <i>to the diet, did he?</i>

37:15.560 --> 37:17.880
Good on him. And what did you find out?

37:17.920 --> 37:19.960
<i>Nothing so far.</i> <i>He wants a bribe.</i>

37:20.000 --> 37:21.520
-Then pay the man. <i>-Dwayne...</i>

37:21.560 --> 37:23.200
I'm a sergeant now, okay?

37:23.240 --> 37:24.520
I can't be seen doing that kind of thing.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.480
It's all part of the game, Fidel!

37:26.520 --> 37:28.720
I've only been in the job a couple of months.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.720
I don't want to mess it up.

37:28.760 --> 37:30.240
Come on now, who will talk?

37:30.280 --> 37:31.480
<i>No one.</i>

37:31.520 --> 37:35.280
Look! $20, that's all it takes.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.560
<i>You know what, Dwayne?</i>

37:36.600 --> 37:38.800
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.160
Oh, God.

37:45.800 --> 37:46.880
That was Fidel.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.800
Any word on the poison

37:48.840 --> 37:52.120
Not yet, but I'm sure he's got it

37:48.840 --> 37:52.120
all under control, sir.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.680
Mmm-hmm.

37:54.720 --> 37:56.160
Miss Cunningham.

37:58.040 --> 37:59.960
You've not been entirely honest with us, have you?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.840
We know about Carl and Susie.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.680
I didn't think it was my place to say.

38:03.720 --> 38:06.400
You've got to be straight with us. We can't help

38:03.720 --> 38:06.400
you if you're not.

38:06.440 --> 38:08.240
This is serious, Lexi.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.000
CAMILLE: Someone's trying to kill you.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.680
So Carl's having an affair, that doesn't make him

38:10.040 --> 38:12.680
a killer.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.400
Let us decide what's important.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.240
Your life is in danger if you don't.

38:17.080 --> 38:18.360
There's nothing else.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.840
-Nothing. I promise you.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.920
Hmm.

38:28.960 --> 38:31.560
The writer, the director and his lover.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.320
Why would any of them want to kill

38:31.600 --> 38:34.320
Lexi Cunningham?

38:34.360 --> 38:38.440
Carl Collins, Lexi knew he was canoodling with Susie Jenkins.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.280
I'm sorry. "Canoodling"?

38:42.080 --> 38:44.800
Grumpy writer blames Lexi for ruining his career.

38:44.840 --> 38:47.400
-Terrible at making tea.

38:47.440 --> 38:50.280
Yes, but canoodling with Carl.

38:50.320 --> 38:53.200
I don't know about you, but none of them

38:50.320 --> 38:53.200
feel like murderers.

38:53.240 --> 38:55.520
Well, the financial reports are back.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.600
Susie Jenkins, she's doing pretty well.

38:57.640 --> 38:59.440
Considering she makes beverages for a living!

38:59.480 --> 39:02.280
Well, actually her parents are well off, they support her.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.160
Carl Collins. Eighteen years ago,

39:04.200 --> 39:06.920
he set up a bank account in the name of Jason Collins.

39:06.960 --> 39:10.000
And every 16th of May, he puts £1,000 in it.

39:10.040 --> 39:12.160
A son, perhaps

39:12.200 --> 39:15.440
I'm looking into it. And Arnold Finch.

39:15.480 --> 39:16.840
-Blimey! -Mmm-hmm.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.640
What are these large payments for?

39:18.680 --> 39:21.760
£3,000 leaves his account every month.

39:21.800 --> 39:24.560
His ex-wife. She came out very well from the divorce.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.920
Now there's something to look forward to.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.440
He's in debt up to his eyeballs.

39:28.480 --> 39:29.920
He's this close to bankruptcy.

39:29.960 --> 39:32.120
Without the sequel, he's facing financial ruin.

39:32.160 --> 39:33.360
So,

39:33.400 --> 39:35.560
Lexi destroys his life.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.840
Perhaps he decides to try and take hers.

39:56.960 --> 40:00.320
How come there are so many channels and nothing to watch?

40:00.360 --> 40:02.080
Are you hungry?

40:02.120 --> 40:03.640
Starving.

40:03.680 --> 40:05.520
Maybe you should order some room service.

40:05.560 --> 40:06.680
Now you're talking.

40:06.720 --> 40:08.480
They do an amazing burger.

40:08.520 --> 40:09.520
A cheeseburger.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.240
With lots of relish. I love relish.

40:11.280 --> 40:12.760
Relish!

40:12.800 --> 40:14.560
Menu should be over there.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.960
And I want skinny fries.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.960
None of this potato-wedgey nonsense.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.440
This yours?

40:28.480 --> 40:32.320
No. I think Carl must've left it

40:28.480 --> 40:32.320
when we swapped rooms.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.320
CAMILLE: The bank account Carl set up?

40:40.360 --> 40:41.520
You were right.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.400
Jason Collins is his son?

40:43.440 --> 40:45.120
From his first marriage.

40:45.160 --> 40:47.880
According to the court papers, it was a messy divorce.

40:47.920 --> 40:52.280
Carl cheated on his ex-wife, she got

40:47.920 --> 40:52.280
sole custody of the kid.

40:52.320 --> 40:53.880
Carl adores his daughters.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.240
Maybe he's scared history will repeat itself.

40:56.280 --> 40:59.480
Maybe he tried to kill Lexi to keep her quiet.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.520
DWAYNE: Guys?

41:01.560 --> 41:03.160
Shouldn't you be watching Lexi?

41:03.200 --> 41:04.800
Don't worry, she's fine.

41:04.840 --> 41:07.040
You've got to see this.

41:07.080 --> 41:08.120
<i>I don't know what to say!</i>

41:08.160 --> 41:10.080
CARL: <i> Just say your name.</i>

41:10.120 --> 41:11.840
<i>Susie Jenkins. Actress.</i>

41:11.880 --> 41:14.720
CARL:  <i>The camera loves you, Suze.</i>

41:14.760 --> 41:18.840
<i>Those things, those monsters,</i> <i>they don't care</i>

41:14.760 --> 41:18.840
<i>about our future.</i>

41:18.880 --> 41:21.240
<i>They'll just keep going,</i> <i>they'll just keep devouring us</i>

41:21.280 --> 41:23.480
<i>and they won't stop until</i> <i>we're dead.</i>

41:23.520 --> 41:26.280
Susie the tea maker wants to be an actress.

41:26.320 --> 41:29.560
Perhaps she tried to kill Lexi to step into her shoes.

41:29.600 --> 41:30.600
That's a bit extreme.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.200
People have killed for less.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.760
Maybe Susie's more ambitious than we first thought.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.960
CARL: <i> That's it, I told you</i> <i>you were a star!</i>

41:43.800 --> 41:45.160
Susie always wanted to act.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.120
Was there any chance of her getting the role?

41:47.160 --> 41:49.440
-I never made her any promises.

41:47.160 --> 41:49.440
-But you got her hopes up

41:49.480 --> 41:51.240
all so you could take advantage of her.

41:51.280 --> 41:53.960
You exploited her ambition so you could get her into bed.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.200
I didn't take advantage. Susie always knew

41:54.000 --> 41:57.200
it was a long shot.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.680
-You lied to her, Mr Collins. -I didn't lie.

41:59.720 --> 42:02.720
Susie has been jealous of Lexi ever since

41:59.720 --> 42:02.720
we started shooting.

42:02.760 --> 42:05.400
Said she doesn't know how lucky she is.

42:02.760 --> 42:05.400
She's right, of course.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.800
She doesn't have a clue. But when Lexi signed up

42:05.440 --> 42:07.800
for the sequel,

42:07.840 --> 42:10.480
I was the one who had to break it to Susie that

42:07.840 --> 42:10.480
she'd missed out on the role.

42:10.520 --> 42:11.960
And she didn't take it well.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.200
What do you think?

42:25.640 --> 42:27.560
Nobody's talking, right?

42:27.600 --> 42:30.480
Okay, Big Dave. Here's the deal.

42:31.320 --> 42:32.520
I'm not Dwayne.

42:32.560 --> 42:34.760
I don't play that game, you understand?

42:34.800 --> 42:38.360
So how do you feel about coming down

42:34.800 --> 42:38.360
to the station with me?

42:38.400 --> 42:40.560
And making this whole thing a lot more formal.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.840
You lie on record, that's perjury.

42:44.880 --> 42:48.480
Perverting the course of justice,

42:44.880 --> 42:48.480
that's 12 months inside.

42:48.520 --> 42:50.000
Who knows what could happen?

42:50.040 --> 42:52.000
You get out, your kids don't want

42:52.040 --> 42:54.000
to know you any more.

42:54.040 --> 42:56.480
Someone else is doing your job.

42:56.520 --> 42:58.560
So now you're homeless. No work.

42:58.600 --> 43:01.240
No money. People cross the road

42:58.600 --> 43:01.240
when they see you coming,

43:01.280 --> 43:03.800
and all because you didn't talk to me.

43:05.160 --> 43:08.000
Dwayne didn't tell me his boss was such a bad-ass.

43:12.760 --> 43:15.320
Somebody was down here last week,

43:15.360 --> 43:18.360
asking where they could get hold of puffer fish poison.

43:18.400 --> 43:21.880
They bought a vial of it. Enough to kill a dozen people.

43:24.080 --> 43:25.520
And you saw who it was?

43:27.160 --> 43:29.240
Yeah.

43:29.280 --> 43:30.640
I saw.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.400
This is hers.

43:37.600 --> 43:39.280
It's the police.

43:43.160 --> 43:44.480
Susie? Open up.

43:46.240 --> 43:48.520
She's in there. Stand back.

43:51.360 --> 43:52.680
Yeah, sure.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.800
CAMILLE: So, what do we think?

44:24.840 --> 44:27.280
Puffer fish poison like she used on Thea?

44:27.320 --> 44:29.440
Mixed it with some water and then drank the lot.

44:34.600 --> 44:36.480
Ah, Fidel.

44:36.520 --> 44:37.560
<i>Any news?</i>

44:37.600 --> 44:39.440
Okay, so listen. I've got a witness.

44:39.480 --> 44:41.600
Man who saw someone buying a vial of poison.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.000
<i>He even heard a name.</i>

44:45.040 --> 44:47.360
Let me guess, Susie Jenkins.

44:48.920 --> 44:50.400
How did you know?

44:50.440 --> 44:51.640
<i>We just found her dead.</i>

44:52.560 --> 44:53.560
Thanks, Fidel.

44:56.840 --> 45:00.000
Lexi was the only obstacle between Susie and her dream.

45:01.800 --> 45:04.560
So she tried to get rid of her.

45:04.600 --> 45:08.080
She must have known we were closing in, and she panicked.

45:08.120 --> 45:11.320
So Susie took the vial of poison she bought

45:08.120 --> 45:11.320
from the docks,

45:11.360 --> 45:17.240
tried to kill Lexi with the chocolates and

45:11.360 --> 45:17.240
drank what was left of it.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.680
-Case closed. -Hmm.

45:40.560 --> 45:41.920
So how much did you have to pay him?

45:41.960 --> 45:43.240
Hmm

45:43.280 --> 45:45.640
Big Dave. For the information.

45:45.680 --> 45:47.040
Nothing, Dwayne.

45:47.080 --> 45:49.200
-I applied a bit of pressure. He caved.

45:49.240 --> 45:51.160
That's why you're a sergeant, and I'm not.

45:55.040 --> 45:58.400
So, maybe now you'll have time to put up your hammock.

45:58.440 --> 46:00.360
It still doesn't quite make sense.

46:00.400 --> 46:03.800
Susie killed herself. It's tantamount to confession.

46:03.840 --> 46:07.400
You know what you're better off doing?

46:03.840 --> 46:07.400
Sign off these case files.

46:07.440 --> 46:09.920
And, uh, maybe give your desk a little bit of a tidy.

46:09.960 --> 46:11.400
How many teas do you need?

46:11.440 --> 46:14.080
Oh, yes. Well, I made some tea and then I forgot the tea,

46:14.120 --> 46:16.080
and then the tea went cold and then I made another tea.

46:16.120 --> 46:17.640
-It was a whole tea debacle. -Mmm.

46:17.680 --> 46:19.840
It wouldn't happen if my wife was here.

46:19.880 --> 46:23.200
Oh, you haven't forgotten to pick her up, have you?

46:23.240 --> 46:25.320
Camille was convinced you'd forget.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.680
Um,

46:30.720 --> 46:31.840
I didn't forget.

46:31.880 --> 46:33.920
She's not coming.

46:33.960 --> 46:35.600
She's left me.

46:35.640 --> 46:36.680
What?

46:39.680 --> 46:40.760
Is there someone else?

46:40.800 --> 46:42.440
Oh, gosh. I hope not. Um...

46:44.200 --> 46:47.080
Anyway, it's just one of those things.

46:47.120 --> 46:48.520
Oh, well, look on the bright side.

46:48.560 --> 46:49.720
Uh, there's a bright side?

46:49.760 --> 46:51.880
Now you get to hang out with me.

46:51.920 --> 46:54.560
I can show you all the best places

46:51.920 --> 46:54.560
to pick up single women.

46:54.600 --> 46:56.560
-Trust me. -That isn't...

46:56.600 --> 46:58.240
That is not a bright side.

46:58.280 --> 47:00.360
So you think he's better off stuck in a bad marriage?

47:00.400 --> 47:02.680
Sometimes you've got to face facts.

47:02.720 --> 47:05.120
The right woman turns out to be

47:02.720 --> 47:05.120
the wrong woman.

47:05.160 --> 47:07.320
That's just the way it is.

47:07.360 --> 47:09.640
Yeah, in a weird way that actually makes sense.

47:09.680 --> 47:12.640
Yeah! When did you get so philosophical?

47:14.400 --> 47:16.040
Oh, that's the cold one?

47:16.080 --> 47:18.360
It's the cold one, yeah. Just my luck.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.600
Two cups.

47:34.720 --> 47:38.040
DWAYNE: <i> Sometimes</i> <i>the right woman turns</i>

47:34.720 --> 47:38.040
<i>out to be the wrong woman.</i>

47:38.080 --> 47:40.960
CARL: <i> When I arrived</i> <i>this morning around 6:00,</i>

47:38.080 --> 47:40.960
<i>they were outside Lexi's tent.</i>

47:41.000 --> 47:42.720
<i>Lexi arrived just as I did.</i>

47:42.760 --> 47:44.120
HUMPHREY: <i> Which would be</i> <i>your first choice?</i>

47:44.160 --> 47:46.400
-Only one.

47:50.520 --> 47:52.640
All this talk about puffer fish poisoning.

47:52.680 --> 47:54.600
It's in the script. Look! Here.

47:57.640 --> 47:59.320
Yes!

47:59.360 --> 48:01.240
That is it!

48:01.280 --> 48:02.280
What?

48:05.080 --> 48:06.240
-Hook-a-duck. -Oh!

48:06.280 --> 48:07.400
Hook

48:07.440 --> 48:08.880
Camille, would you mind doing that thing

48:08.920 --> 48:10.400
where you gather everyone together?

48:10.440 --> 48:13.320
I rather enjoyed that last time.

48:13.360 --> 48:15.960
Dwayne, I need you to go to set and find

48:13.360 --> 48:15.960
something for me.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.560
I thought the case was closed. I've just reopened it.

48:20.560 --> 48:22.920
Find a what?

48:22.960 --> 48:25.080
Where on the set does he want me to check?

48:25.120 --> 48:26.160
Sir!

48:27.480 --> 48:29.160
How long is this going to take?

48:35.000 --> 48:36.040
The movies.

48:37.440 --> 48:40.440
When we all sit down in the dark

48:37.440 --> 48:40.440
with our popcorn,

48:40.480 --> 48:43.040
we're all allowing ourselves to be deceived.

48:43.080 --> 48:44.600
We're all buying in to the fiction.

48:46.520 --> 48:49.720
Yesterday morning a 27-year-old girl,

48:46.520 --> 48:49.720
Thea Homes, was poisoned

48:49.760 --> 48:53.280
by a chocolate that was intended

48:49.760 --> 48:53.280
for Lexi Cunningham.

48:53.320 --> 48:56.040
When Susie committed suicide, it appeared that the case

48:56.080 --> 48:59.440
was all neatly wrapped up in a nice little bow.

49:00.960 --> 49:04.160
It was all a deception, of course.

49:05.320 --> 49:07.960
Someone set Susie up.

49:10.360 --> 49:13.120
You see, that was the biggest mistake we made on this case.

49:13.160 --> 49:15.560
We allowed ourselves to be deceived.

49:18.440 --> 49:21.160
Has anyone ever played hook

49:21.200 --> 49:24.840
-Yes!

49:24.880 --> 49:27.720
You clearly had a dull childhood, too, Mr Finch.

49:28.800 --> 49:30.480
You see, when I played that game,

49:30.520 --> 49:32.760
my chances of hooking the winning duck were minimal.

49:32.800 --> 49:36.000
As were the murderer's of getting Lexi to eat

49:32.800 --> 49:36.000
the one cherry cream

49:36.040 --> 49:39.200
containing the puffer fish poison.

49:39.240 --> 49:43.320
Which is something you know a lot about, isn't it,

49:43.360 --> 49:44.480
Mr Finch?

49:44.520 --> 49:47.160
I was looking into it for research.

49:47.200 --> 49:49.480
-Purely coincidence.

49:49.520 --> 49:51.880
I'm afraid none of this was a coincidence,

49:53.320 --> 49:55.240
Carl Collins.

49:55.280 --> 49:56.480
Me? I didn't kill anyone.

49:56.520 --> 49:59.080
For those of you who don't know, tell us,

49:59.120 --> 50:03.840
how did I discover that you were having

49:59.120 --> 50:03.840
an affair with Susie?

50:03.880 --> 50:06.800
A cup of tea. -A cup of tea. Precisely.

50:06.840 --> 50:09.200
Which is also how I figured out

50:06.840 --> 50:09.200
how the murder was committed,

50:09.240 --> 50:12.360
only this time it was two cups of tea.

50:12.400 --> 50:14.160
Thank you, Dwayne.

50:14.200 --> 50:16.240
One hot, one cold.

50:18.120 --> 50:19.240
Both identical.

50:23.520 --> 50:27.280
See, why try and kill Lexi Cunningham

50:28.640 --> 50:30.640
with one poisoned chocolate?

50:32.520 --> 50:36.160
The answer? No-one was trying to kill Lexi Cunningham.

50:37.440 --> 50:39.200
Thea

50:39.240 --> 50:42.920
was the intended victim all along.

50:42.960 --> 50:44.080
Isn't that right, Lexi?

50:47.560 --> 50:49.160
Thea was my friend.

50:50.920 --> 50:53.800
HUMPHREY: I had Dwayne search the set,

50:53.840 --> 50:55.720
and look what he found.

50:55.760 --> 50:57.560
You poisoned Thea Homes

51:00.320 --> 51:02.040
with this box of chocolates.

51:04.560 --> 51:07.400
I would offer them around, but I fear they're quite

51:04.560 --> 51:07.400
inedible,

51:07.440 --> 51:10.320
-and probably a little bit melty by now.

51:07.440 --> 51:10.320
-This is ridiculous.

51:10.360 --> 51:12.840
-HUMPHREY: Not ridiculous at all, as it happens.

51:10.360 --> 51:12.840
-Sit.

51:15.400 --> 51:18.320
Let's start with the poison. Fidel spoke to a witness

51:18.360 --> 51:22.080
who claims he saw Susie Jenkins buying

51:18.360 --> 51:22.080
the puffer fish poison.

51:22.120 --> 51:24.680
Yes, but it wasn't Susie Jenkins.

51:26.120 --> 51:27.280
<i>It was you.</i>

51:30.200 --> 51:32.400
What's a girl like you doing with that nasty stuff?

51:32.440 --> 51:33.920
HUMPHREY: <i>You deliberately framed her.</i>

51:33.960 --> 51:36.080
LEXI: Hello? Susie speaking.

51:38.520 --> 51:41.080
HUMPHREY: <i> Then you</i> <i>bought two identical</i>

51:38.520 --> 51:41.080
<i>boxes of chocolates.</i>

51:41.120 --> 51:42.840
<i>You injected one</i> <i>with the puffer fish poison,</i>

51:42.880 --> 51:44.560
<i>something you read about</i> <i>in your script,</i>

51:44.600 --> 51:46.640
<i>leaving the other</i> <i>box untouched.</i>

51:46.680 --> 51:49.920
<i>The morning Thea died,</i> <i>you crept onto set before</i>

51:46.680 --> 51:49.920
<i>anyone else was in,</i>

51:49.960 --> 51:52.120
<i>and you left the un-poisoned</i> <i>box by your tent.</i>

51:52.160 --> 51:54.240
Now, Carl assumed that they were a gift

51:54.280 --> 51:57.280
from the production company, exactly as you hoped.

51:57.320 --> 51:59.880
He put them out where anyone could get their

51:57.320 --> 51:59.880
hands on them.

51:59.920 --> 52:01.480
Anyone fancy some posh chocolates?

52:01.520 --> 52:04.160
HUMPHREY: <i> Now everyone</i> <i>would think the food tent</i>

52:04.200 --> 52:07.640
<i>was where the crime</i> <i>took place, when, in fact,</i>

52:07.680 --> 52:10.760
<i>you gave Thea the poisoned</i> <i>chocolate yourself.</i>

52:16.920 --> 52:18.720
Two cups of tea.

52:18.760 --> 52:19.920
Two boxes of chocolates.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.280
Thea took the cherry creme,

52:23.320 --> 52:27.640
so, rather ingeniously, you told us that was

52:23.320 --> 52:27.640
your favourite.

52:27.680 --> 52:31.160
-The cherry one.

52:31.200 --> 52:32.800
In fact, credit where credit is due, Lexi,

52:32.840 --> 52:35.680
you've been pretty ingenious all along.

52:35.720 --> 52:38.520
Put us off the scent a number of times.

52:38.560 --> 52:40.880
<i>Even set up an incident which</i> <i>could be taken as evidence</i>

52:40.920 --> 52:43.800
<i>that you were</i> <i>the intended victim.</i>

52:43.840 --> 52:46.360
You planted the DVD and made sure

52:43.840 --> 52:46.360
that Dwayne found it.

52:46.400 --> 52:48.120
That bought you the time alone you needed.

52:48.160 --> 52:51.240
You crept along the balcony to Susie's room.

52:51.280 --> 52:53.920
<i>You poisoned her water,</i> <i>and you waited.</i>

52:57.560 --> 53:00.400
<i>There was enough</i> <i>poison left to kill,</i>

52:57.560 --> 53:00.400
<i>and kill quickly.</i>

53:02.480 --> 53:04.440
<i>You set the scene</i> <i>as a suicide,</i>

53:04.480 --> 53:06.600
<i>an apparent</i> <i>confession of guilt.</i>

53:10.760 --> 53:13.760
But you didn't count on one thing,

53:13.800 --> 53:15.880
us giving you a bodyguard.

53:17.800 --> 53:20.800
Which meant you couldn't get rid of these.

53:22.600 --> 53:25.280
<i>And you hid the evidence</i> <i>in plain sight.</i>

53:28.440 --> 53:31.360
This isn't the first time you've killed, is it?

53:31.400 --> 53:34.640
HUMPHREY: And Thea knew that. You were friends.

53:34.680 --> 53:36.960
Same school, same estate.

53:38.640 --> 53:40.760
Only you got out and became an actress.

53:40.800 --> 53:45.080
You said that some years later, you heard

53:40.800 --> 53:45.080
she'd gone to prison.

53:45.120 --> 53:46.760
It was a mugging that went wrong.

53:46.800 --> 53:50.800
The police report states that they found Thea

53:46.800 --> 53:50.800
covered in blood.

53:50.840 --> 53:53.640
Knife in hand. A <i> fait accompli.</i>

53:54.760 --> 53:57.320
But here's where it gets interesting.

53:57.360 --> 54:03.400
Witnesses say they saw two people running away

53:57.360 --> 54:03.400
from the murder scene.

54:03.440 --> 54:05.520
They never found that other person.

54:05.560 --> 54:06.840
Thea covered for you.

54:08.200 --> 54:11.480
She was in prison for eight years.

54:11.520 --> 54:13.960
That moment changed her life. It changed yours, too.

54:15.120 --> 54:17.200
<i>You never once looked back,</i>

54:17.240 --> 54:19.400
<i>until the day she walked</i> <i>onto this set.</i>

54:24.920 --> 54:27.280
You'd just signed a contract for the sequel.

54:27.320 --> 54:29.400
Fame and fortune were within your grasp.

54:29.440 --> 54:31.520
You couldn't let anything spoil that.

54:31.560 --> 54:33.680
Only, Thea wasn't going anywhere.

54:33.720 --> 54:35.560
You owed her and she knew it.

54:35.600 --> 54:38.320
CARL: Good, okay, rest up, that's working. Lovely.

54:38.360 --> 54:42.600
-Hey! You must be starving. -Oh, you angel.

54:38.360 --> 54:42.600
I'll pay you back.

54:42.640 --> 54:44.560
No, it's all right. Put it on the tab.

54:44.600 --> 54:47.280
You got her a job as your stand-in

54:44.600 --> 54:47.280
but that wasn't enough.

54:47.320 --> 54:50.880
She was going to bleed you dry.

54:50.920 --> 54:52.680
Or ruin your life.

54:52.720 --> 54:54.960
Either way, she had to go.

55:00.480 --> 55:02.000
Fidel, if you'd do the honours.

55:02.040 --> 55:04.320
DWAYNE: No. I've got this.

55:05.480 --> 55:06.520
Up.

55:10.240 --> 55:14.200
I guess we're never going to get to see

55:10.240 --> 55:14.200
the waterfalls now.

55:14.240 --> 55:15.440
I guess not.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.240
Move.

55:41.560 --> 55:44.280
Well, I heard it, but I didn't believe it.

55:44.320 --> 55:47.480
-There's nothing of you, man. -Three stone and counting!

55:51.000 --> 55:52.600
You know how many calories are in that bottle?

55:52.640 --> 55:55.640
Yes, loads! Now drink up then, man!

55:55.680 --> 55:58.600
Quickly, before me wife sees.

55:58.640 --> 56:02.280
Oh, by the way, thanks for giving

55:58.640 --> 56:02.280
my boss that information.

56:02.320 --> 56:06.360
Ah! You should've let him pay me himself.

56:06.400 --> 56:09.200
I knew he'd never get it out of you any other way.

56:09.240 --> 56:11.520
It's only his first few months as sergeant,

56:11.560 --> 56:14.040
and he's a bit low in confidence.

56:14.080 --> 56:17.240
He needed a bit of a boost, you know? So...

56:20.600 --> 56:21.920
Cheers.

56:22.560 --> 56:23.840
Cheers.

56:28.520 --> 56:29.880
Ah!

56:29.920 --> 56:31.920
It truly is the nectar of the Gods.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.080
Ah! Mmm.

56:33.120 --> 56:35.960
WOMAN: Dave! What are you drinking?

56:36.000 --> 56:37.360
Right, I'm a dead man!

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Sad, really.

56:43.040 --> 56:45.280
Tried so hard to escape her past.

56:45.320 --> 56:46.520
To move on.

56:49.440 --> 56:51.960
Sometimes facing the truth is hard.

56:56.080 --> 56:57.720
You're doing it again.

56:57.760 --> 57:00.760
-Looking overly concerned.

57:02.400 --> 57:03.800
What?

57:03.840 --> 57:06.720
If you want to talk some more, you know, about your wife.

57:06.760 --> 57:10.200
I'm fine, Camille. I'm British.

57:10.240 --> 57:15.400
I'm going for the bottle-it- all-up-and-turn-it-into-

57:10.240 --> 57:15.400
a-bitter-little-ball approach.

57:15.440 --> 57:18.960
-But you look sad. -I'm not sad.

57:15.440 --> 57:18.960
I'm squinting.

57:19.000 --> 57:23.280
My squinty face is uncannily similar to my sad face. See?

57:25.120 --> 57:26.960
There.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.560
Humphrey, one. Hammock, nil.

57:46.800 --> 57:48.560
Just you and me now, old thing.

57:50.600 --> 57:52.920
Come on, then. Plenty of room.

57:56.560 --> 57:57.720
Oh!

58:00.720 --> 58:02.640
Touche, hammock.

58:02.680 --> 58:03.960
Touche!

58:08.240 --> 58:09.480
Friend of yours?

58:09.520 --> 58:11.240
Yeah, a long time ago.

58:11.280 --> 58:13.440
Hey! Where are you going?

58:13.480 --> 58:15.120
Carlton Paris. Shot.

58:15.160 --> 58:17.000
HUMPHREY: <i>We have a 25-year-old man.</i>

58:17.040 --> 58:20.720
He studies culture for conversation and receives

58:17.040 --> 58:20.720
gifts from rich women.

58:20.760 --> 58:22.240
Feels like I'm missing something.

58:22.280 --> 58:23.960
We had so much in common!

58:26.120 --> 58:28.000
A man who preyed on the lonely.

58:28.040 --> 58:29.800
HUMPHREY: Why not call you when he was in trouble?

58:29.840 --> 58:32.160
-You were a good friend. -I wasn't a good friend.
