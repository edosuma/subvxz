Why, yes. [Chuckles]

Ms. Bridges, precautionary principles

It's possible that suicide wasn't.

Yeah, but people have
offed themselves for less.

<i>Well, that's what everyone assumed.</i>

08:16.899 --> 08:18.732
Elaine even said her brother was depressed,

08:18.734 --> 08:21.268
but here's the thing...
according to the report,

08:21.270 --> 08:25.505
<i>one hotel guest said that
she heard loud male voices</i>

08:25.507 --> 08:27.340
before Abel went all flying squirrel.

08:27.342 --> 08:29.142
And nobody followed it up?

08:29.144 --> 08:30.643
The woman admitted she was drunk,

08:30.645 --> 08:32.044
and the cops didn't believe her.

08:32.047 --> 08:33.712
But it's still possible Abel Mindler

08:33.715 --> 08:35.448
didn't die voluntarily.

08:35.450 --> 08:38.418
Well, whatever happened, Walter
definitely knows something.

08:38.419 --> 08:40.754
That SIM card he put in the burner phone

08:40.756 --> 08:42.889
belongs to Abel.

08:56.937 --> 09:00.039
<i>(Reese) Any idea why Walter's
got the dead guy's SIM card?</i>

09:00.041 --> 09:02.609
Nope. I have gone through
everything on that card.

<i>There is not one text or

09:05.313 --> 09:08.514
Oh, but some guy named, uh, Banks Van Hess

09:08.516 --> 09:10.450
did text Abel a lot.

09:10.452 --> 09:12.719

09:12.721 --> 09:15.154
Close... about an important delivery,

09:15.156 --> 09:18.124

12:12.063 --> 12:15.431
bonk on the head there. Uh...

12:15.433 --> 12:18.434
so are you and I working
the same case, Detective?

12:18.436 --> 12:23.339

12:23.341 --> 12:25.808
Forge, Jack... Jack Forge.

12:25.810 --> 12:28.411

12:28.413 --> 12:31.781
Uh, yes, you and I are... I'm...

12:31.783 --> 12:34.584
This murder ties into... into a new case

12:34.586 --> 12:37.320
I'm investigating.

12:37.322 --> 12:38.955
Well, I should be going.

12:38.957 --> 12:42.124
I sure could use your help, Forge.

12:42.126 --> 12:46.462
Maybe we could, uh,
you know, compare notes.

12:49.433 --> 12:51.133
Yeah.

12:51.135 --> 12:54.170
I started out trying to
find Abel's suicide note.

12:54.172 --> 12:56.138
The sister wanted my help.

12:56.140 --> 12:59.074
Jack Forge does not
like to let a lady down.

12:59.076 --> 13:02.711
No, of course not, but you
found something else instead?

13:02.713 --> 13:05.181
Yeah, on Abel's phone.

13:07.484 --> 13:08.818
Hey. Fusco.

13:08.820 --> 13:10.219
Lionel, hey, I need to speak to you.

13:10.221 --> 13:13.956
Forge, Detective Forge.

13:13.958 --> 13:15.925
My partner tells me you see a link

13:15.927 --> 13:18.227
between my homicide and
some suicide you're working?

13:18.229 --> 13:20.696
Yeah, Abel Mindler...
he was a truck driver,

13:20.698 --> 13:22.898
and Van Hess worked at the port authority

13:22.900 --> 13:25.134
handling all incoming
shipping at that airport, so...

13:25.136 --> 13:26.969
So you're thinking smuggling, right?

13:26.971 --> 13:29.238
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I called
Abel's old trucking company.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.040
One of their trucks is missing.

13:31.042 --> 13:33.575
Now Van Hess is dead.

13:33.577 --> 13:37.079
What if Abel wasn't a suicide?

13:37.081 --> 13:40.149
Jack Forge does not believe in coincidence.

13:40.151 --> 13:42.184
Hold on. That's a victim's phone.

13:44.153 --> 13:45.187
Yeah.

13:45.189 --> 13:48.090
Where's the tag?

13:48.092 --> 13:49.791

13:51.794 --> 13:53.095
The tag fell off.

13:53.097 --> 13:55.430
Yeah, Lionel, it fell off.

13:55.432 --> 13:58.600
[Whispering] Can I talk to you for a sec?

13:58.602 --> 14:00.902

14:04.974 --> 14:06.908
Could you take it easy on the guy?

14:06.910 --> 14:08.343
The guy isn't a cop.

14:08.345 --> 14:10.378
I know, but he thinks he's working a case

14:10.380 --> 14:13.982

killed, so play nice.

14:51.688 --> 14:53.254
Okay, put him on.

14:55.758 --> 14:59.127
Who's a good boy? You are, Bear.

was telling you about...

Well, where were we?

15:41.204 --> 15:43.270
Oh, yes, I was about to reveal to you

15:43.272 --> 15:44.972

angel investor interested.

15:59.255 --> 16:00.721
Look at the time.

16:00.723 --> 16:03.257
Perhaps we should head back to the hotel.

16:03.259 --> 16:07.027
If you admit I won the argument.

16:10.031 --> 16:13.000
Are you really as suspicious
of artificial neural nets

16:13.002 --> 16:14.468

16:14.470 --> 16:16.670
I trust people more than
machines, that's all.

16:16.672 --> 16:18.839
That's an odd thing for a scientist to say.

16:18.841 --> 16:21.942

- Beautiful?
- Yeah.

At first, you don't
realize the implications,

16:41.030 --> 16:43.263
It's the five most important constants,

24:12.858 --> 24:14.693
I got Walter secured. You good?

24:14.695 --> 24:16.995
Good? I'm herniated.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.464
This super gun is super heavy.

24:19.466 --> 24:22.233
No luck tracing those calls to Walter.

24:22.235 --> 24:24.636
Whoever it is really knows their stuff.

24:24.638 --> 24:26.337
<i>They bounced that call
around the world twice</i>

24:26.339 --> 24:27.872
<i>- before it even got to our boy.
- And?</i>

24:27.874 --> 24:30.108
Worse news... I found another deleted text

24:30.110 --> 24:32.210
from Abel the truck driver.

24:32.212 --> 24:36.748
That gun we recovered... it's a prototype.

24:36.750 --> 24:39.384
Abel and Van Hess brought
in 20 crates last week.

24:39.386 --> 24:42.320
That's 100 of those guns.

24:42.322 --> 24:43.788
[Sighs]

24:43.790 --> 24:47.458
And we've got no idea who's got them.

24:47.460 --> 24:49.327
- How you doing?
- Hey, how's it going?

24:49.329 --> 24:51.996
Detective Fusco. I need to check this in.

24:51.998 --> 24:55.533
No problem, Detective.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.935
I need you to sign here and here.

25:12.050 --> 25:14.819
[Keys jingling]

25:19.758 --> 25:22.693
Hello, there. You must be Walter.

25:22.695 --> 25:26.697
Nate Elliot, FBI. It's good to meet you.

25:26.699 --> 25:29.200
Detective Riley seems to
think that you might be able

25:29.202 --> 25:31.635
to help us with this gun-smuggling case.

25:31.637 --> 25:35.372
Well, I'm always happy to help the law.

25:35.374 --> 25:36.974
[Zipper opens]

25:42.447 --> 25:45.482
Okay, let's go.

25:50.255 --> 25:52.856
Walter?

25:52.858 --> 25:54.892
<i>- Gun! Everyone down!
- (Man) Down! Get down!</i>

25:54.894 --> 25:56.493
- John?
- Sorry, Detective.

25:56.495 --> 26:00.130
He's coming with us. Everyone back.

26:00.132 --> 26:02.433
<i>- John?
- (Man) Drop your weapon!</i>

26:02.435 --> 26:04.268
J-John?

26:07.438 --> 26:08.605
Ugh!

26:11.776 --> 26:13.210
Are you all right?

26:13.212 --> 26:14.878
What the hell is going on?

26:14.880 --> 26:16.380
Elias.

26:16.382 --> 26:18.282
Come on.

26:29.249 --> 26:30.716
Elias is sending his men to our house.

26:30.718 --> 26:31.884
He looking to start a war?

26:31.886 --> 26:33.786
You sure you're all right?

26:33.788 --> 26:36.388
Mother always said I had a hard head.

26:36.390 --> 26:37.990
Don't worry, I'll get
Walter to the safe house.

26:37.992 --> 26:39.191
Meet you there. First, I have to see

26:39.193 --> 26:40.893
an old friend.

26:43.563 --> 26:45.431
<i>(Reese) Tell me where Elias is.</i>

26:45.433 --> 26:47.433
<i>(Man) I'm texting you an address.</i>

26:47.435 --> 26:50.469
<i>Come alone.</i>

26:50.471 --> 26:53.504
_

26:53.506 --> 26:55.407
[Buzzer]

27:15.962 --> 27:20.665
There's no need for that, sir.
Mr. Elias is expecting you.

27:27.006 --> 27:29.608
This way.

27:43.389 --> 27:46.358
<i>(Elias) Hello, John.</i>

27:47.860 --> 27:49.828
See anything you like?

27:49.830 --> 27:52.263
Grand theft.

27:52.265 --> 27:56.134
Assaulting a police officer,
attempted kidnapping.

27:56.136 --> 27:57.802
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't

27:57.804 --> 27:59.838
take you out right now.

27:59.840 --> 28:00.939
I'll give you three.

28:00.941 --> 28:02.173
[Guns cocking]

28:02.175 --> 28:06.144
All pointed at your head.

28:06.146 --> 28:08.980
Let's take a walk, shall we?

28:12.818 --> 28:15.420
I have to tell you, I'm disappointed, John,

28:15.422 --> 28:16.854
as a friend.

28:16.856 --> 28:18.556
You seem to forget who I am,

28:18.558 --> 28:20.491
a man with business interests.

28:20.493 --> 28:23.061
Like guns?

28:24.396 --> 28:27.098
No. No, no, no.

28:27.100 --> 28:30.435
This establishment belongs
to my friend Ricardo.

28:30.437 --> 28:33.571
Personally, I don't care much
for the illegal gun trade,

28:33.573 --> 28:36.607
but someone has to keep it under control.

28:36.609 --> 28:38.576
Otherwise, the city turns into Chicago.

28:38.578 --> 28:40.044
Chicago's a mess, John.

28:40.046 --> 28:42.113
It's like a damn Tarantino movie out there.

28:42.115 --> 28:43.648
You and I have a problem.

28:43.650 --> 28:45.316
You tried to grab up my witness, twice.

28:45.318 --> 28:47.618
No, just once, at the precinct.

28:47.620 --> 28:49.353
The other attempt was the armorer.

28:49.355 --> 28:51.022
- The armorer?
- He's not important.

28:51.024 --> 28:53.257
What's important is that
I speak with your witness.

28:53.259 --> 28:56.427
You seem to forget who I am.

28:56.429 --> 28:59.764
Now, you tell me about this armorer.

28:59.766 --> 29:02.600
He's a weapons man from Chicago.

29:02.602 --> 29:04.535
He brought in a hundred
of these next-gen guns

29:04.537 --> 29:06.837
by leveraging a port authority supervisor.

29:06.839 --> 29:08.539
- Banks Van Hess.
- Mm.

29:08.541 --> 29:10.674
He hired a driver by
the name of Abel Mindler

29:10.676 --> 29:12.576
- to transport them.
- Yes,

29:12.578 --> 29:14.478
but Abel Mindler was an honest man.

29:14.480 --> 29:15.846
Once he realized what he was carrying,

29:15.848 --> 29:18.115
he dumped the truck with the guns.

29:18.117 --> 29:20.317
The truck.

29:20.319 --> 29:23.020
The truck is still missing.

29:23.022 --> 29:25.189
Those weapons are still
out there somewhere.

29:25.191 --> 29:27.691
Which is why the armorer
sent men to have a chat

29:27.693 --> 29:29.893
with Abel Mindler, but it went awry.

29:29.895 --> 29:33.063
Abel had a nasty fall
trying to escape them.

29:33.065 --> 29:37.034
It's hard to find good help these days.

29:37.036 --> 29:40.637
But now your man knows
where the truck is, John.

29:40.639 --> 29:43.640
It's got to be why the
armorer is after him,

29:43.642 --> 29:47.277
and it's why you're gonna
bring Walter Dang to me.

29:49.781 --> 29:52.749
That's not gonna happen.

30:01.687 --> 30:05.215
_

30:08.900 --> 30:11.368
He should have come out to
deliver some food by now.

30:11.370 --> 30:13.436
Maybe they're backed up.

30:15.773 --> 30:19.342
I realize why you disagree
with my work, by the way.

30:19.344 --> 30:20.744
Oh?

30:20.746 --> 30:24.114
You don't feel the end justifies the means.

30:24.116 --> 30:27.317
Don't I?

30:27.319 --> 30:29.819
I know what it means to
build something troubling,

30:29.821 --> 30:32.589
because in the end, it might help people,

30:32.591 --> 30:34.324
and I know what it means to regret it,

30:34.326 --> 30:37.627
so I suppose you could say it depends.

30:37.629 --> 30:41.063
Are you having second thoughts
about what we're doing here?

30:50.641 --> 30:52.809
Excuse me.

30:57.948 --> 31:00.216
Where are our things?

31:00.218 --> 31:02.418
There.

31:07.291 --> 31:09.192
We should run.

31:12.663 --> 31:15.832
So where's this safe house?

31:15.834 --> 31:18.501
It's close. John's on his way.

31:18.503 --> 31:21.370
So listen, let me ask you a question.

31:21.372 --> 31:22.805
How long you been working with him?

31:22.807 --> 31:24.807
My partner? A couple months.

31:24.809 --> 31:26.509
No, I don't mean Detective Riley.

31:26.511 --> 31:30.947
I mean John. You know, secret identity.

31:30.949 --> 31:32.448
<i>Few years, right, right here in New York?</i>

31:32.450 --> 31:33.516
<i>I wanted to ask you about that.</i>

31:33.518 --> 31:37.720
[Phone ringing]

31:37.722 --> 31:39.055
Yeah, Fusco.

31:39.057 --> 31:41.357
I know why people are after Walter.

31:41.359 --> 31:44.160
It's not what he knows, it's
what he has... Abel's phone.

31:44.162 --> 31:46.261
- Phone?
- What phone?

31:47.297 --> 31:49.198
<i>(Reese) Abel ditched
the truck with the guns,</i>

31:49.200 --> 31:52.034
<i>but his phone kept a record
of the G.P.S. coordinates.</i>

31:52.036 --> 31:55.938
Walter, you've basically got
a treasure map in your pocket.

31:58.175 --> 31:59.675
Come on, we're gonna get you inside now.

31:59.677 --> 32:02.745
You move and we take your boy apart!

32:02.747 --> 32:05.114
The phone! Where's Mindler's phone?

32:05.116 --> 32:07.850
[Grunts]

32:07.852 --> 32:10.419
You move an inch, and
I'll blow your head off.

32:11.087 --> 32:12.454
John!

32:27.170 --> 32:29.037
Come on, come on.

32:42.755 --> 32:43.546
[Winces] I think it missed

32:43.548 --> 32:45.214
the major blood vessel, Shaw.

32:45.216 --> 32:47.717
Oh, but your deltoid
is gonna hurt like hell.

32:47.719 --> 32:49.852
Damn! Why couldn't Finch be
here playing computer games?

32:49.854 --> 32:51.988
Yeah, well, he's not, so you
want to tell me where I'm going?

32:51.990 --> 32:53.556
The bad guys got the
phone, and they'll use it

32:53.558 --> 32:55.625
to find the truckload of
guns, and when they do,

32:55.627 --> 32:57.493
Walter will be one dead fake cop.

32:57.495 --> 32:58.528
Ow.

32:58.530 --> 33:00.296
Baby.

33:01.331 --> 33:04.167
Okay, the armorer has the
phone, but we have the backup

33:04.169 --> 33:06.836
of the cell phone G.P.S. coordinates.

33:06.838 --> 33:11.507
<i>I'm sending you there
now. Keep going north.</i>

33:15.579 --> 33:19.448
They're all here, Boss, all 20 cases.

33:22.486 --> 33:25.655
<i>(Man) Yeah, it's me. We're in business.</i>

33:25.657 --> 33:29.058
We have the guns.

33:35.098 --> 33:37.566
That means I don't need you anymore.

33:37.568 --> 33:39.335
Do it.

33:39.337 --> 33:40.469
No! No! No! No! No!

33:40.471 --> 33:43.338
<i>(Fusco) Drop your weapons!</i>

33:44.507 --> 33:46.742
Gentlemen.

33:50.246 --> 33:53.015
Crap.

33:53.017 --> 33:54.350
Finish it.

33:54.352 --> 33:55.484
[Gunfire]

33:55.486 --> 33:56.685
Ah!

34:00.657 --> 34:02.224
[Screams]

34:07.764 --> 34:09.130
Uh! Help!

34:16.039 --> 34:17.205
Ah!

34:17.206 --> 34:18.373
It's about time you showed up.

34:18.375 --> 34:20.275
<i>(Nathan) You're welcome.</i>

34:35.757 --> 34:38.092
John! [Screams]

34:40.996 --> 34:42.731
Ow!

34:44.801 --> 34:47.668
[Coughs] I got you shot.

34:47.670 --> 34:51.005
I let you down. [Panting]

34:51.007 --> 34:52.873
I'm sorry.

34:52.876 --> 34:55.976
Here, you did good.

35:10.426 --> 35:13.628
[Beeps]

35:16.098 --> 35:19.300
Nice try.

35:24.707 --> 35:29.544
So you're the armorer. It's a pleasure.

35:29.546 --> 35:32.513
Those guns would have changed
the balance of power in my city.

35:32.515 --> 35:35.016
Did you think I'd let that happen?

35:35.018 --> 35:37.952
He's smarter than you, old man.

35:39.455 --> 35:42.690
You're not the one behind this.

35:42.692 --> 35:46.327
Oh, that's good. That's good.

35:47.729 --> 35:49.564
Tell me who it is.

35:49.566 --> 35:51.365
Tell me now, I put you on a helicopter

35:51.367 --> 35:53.768
and save your life. You get to live.

35:57.105 --> 35:58.306
Screw you.

36:02.077 --> 36:03.444
Sorry.

36:03.446 --> 36:05.746
No, that's all right. I know who it is.

36:19.594 --> 36:22.429
Am I gonna die?

36:22.431 --> 36:24.631
You got shot in the arm, not the head.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.269
Ah!

36:28.271 --> 36:30.804
That was so awesome!

36:30.806 --> 36:33.440
Ow! Ow.

36:48.690 --> 36:49.756
What happened?

36:49.758 --> 36:50.791
Don't say it. But...

36:50.793 --> 36:51.959
No, don't say it. It...

36:51.961 --> 36:54.494
- it's just a scratch.
- [Groans]

36:55.730 --> 36:58.765
So, um, Mr. Dang, on behalf of the NYPD,

36:58.767 --> 37:01.335
I'd like to thank you
for helping us take down

37:01.337 --> 37:03.070
a dangerous gun smuggler.

37:03.072 --> 37:05.038
Wow!

37:05.040 --> 37:08.875
[Applause]

37:12.613 --> 37:16.850
Um, just a sec. Come on,
I need to speak with you.

37:21.489 --> 37:25.192
So, Walter...

37:25.194 --> 37:28.995
what you've seen with me
and my, uh, other friends...

37:28.997 --> 37:32.465
Don't worry. Nobody
would believe me anyway.

37:32.467 --> 37:36.369
Hey, listen, that vigilante I heard about,

37:36.371 --> 37:37.938
the man in the suit?

37:37.940 --> 37:39.806
I didn't tell you the rest.

37:39.808 --> 37:43.009
He disappeared a few months
ago, and crime went up...

37:43.011 --> 37:46.646
violence, killings,

37:46.648 --> 37:48.281
and the city needed somebody
to keep up the fight,

37:48.283 --> 37:49.949
so I figured, why not me?

37:49.951 --> 37:52.786
But you know, "me" kind of sucks,

37:52.788 --> 37:56.556
so I invented Detective Forge,

37:56.558 --> 38:00.827
all because the man in the suit went away.

38:00.829 --> 38:05.865
But I was wrong, wasn't I?
He wasn't really gone at all.

38:09.904 --> 38:12.338
Good-bye, Walter.

38:14.108 --> 38:16.276
[Chuckles]

38:27.788 --> 38:29.722
Hi.

38:29.724 --> 38:33.326
I want to... I want to
talk to you about Abel.

38:33.328 --> 38:35.228
- Okay?
- Okay.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.996
Come on.

38:43.303 --> 38:46.305
<i>(Elias) It's time we had
a chat about your truck.</i>

39:03.089 --> 39:04.623
Elias?

39:04.625 --> 39:07.726
Dominic, you're a hard man to find.

39:07.728 --> 39:11.096
Where are they?

39:11.098 --> 39:13.565
Don't play, old man. You know why I came.

39:13.567 --> 39:16.335
The guns are gone, for good.

39:16.337 --> 39:18.270
My friend at the NYPD agreed

39:18.272 --> 39:20.172
to personally supervise their destruction.

39:20.174 --> 39:22.441
Your friend, John Riley?

39:25.345 --> 39:26.745
How many'd you bring?

39:26.747 --> 39:28.781
Snipers? Three.

39:28.783 --> 39:31.817
Plus the Barrett gun prototype
about a half mile that way.

39:31.819 --> 39:33.485
I kept that one for myself.

39:33.487 --> 39:35.420
Guess I should be flattered.

39:35.422 --> 39:38.290
Some underestimate you. I don't.

39:39.526 --> 39:43.628
You created the armorer, a figurehead

39:43.630 --> 39:46.265
to take the fall for you
if the gun deal went bad.

39:46.267 --> 39:48.967
Is that what I did?

39:48.969 --> 39:51.803
This is the second time you've seen fit

39:51.805 --> 39:53.805
to interfere in my business.

39:53.807 --> 39:58.143
<i>You should've stayed underground.</i>

39:58.145 --> 40:01.146
Years ago, back before the ice breakers,

40:01.148 --> 40:03.215
this water would freeze
over in winter sometimes,

40:03.217 --> 40:04.916
all the way across.

40:04.918 --> 40:08.086
It looked quiet, almost
dead, but it wasn't.

40:08.088 --> 40:09.954
- No?
- No, no.

40:09.956 --> 40:12.290
Just hidden for a while.

40:12.292 --> 40:15.126
But after its winter period,
it would roar back to life,

40:15.128 --> 40:19.564
the water flowing so fast,
an unwary man could drown.

40:19.566 --> 40:21.833
So springtime's here, is that it?

40:21.835 --> 40:24.302
I have never interfered
in your business, Dominic.

40:24.304 --> 40:28.840
I have only conducted my own.
You'd do well to stay clear.

40:28.842 --> 40:32.377
A man is not a river,

40:32.379 --> 40:35.546
and you are not a king.

40:49.928 --> 40:54.198
Harold, what are you doing next month?

40:54.200 --> 40:56.234
Why?

40:56.236 --> 40:58.703
I have to be in New York.

40:58.705 --> 41:00.037
Angel investor nonsense.

41:00.039 --> 41:04.041
I thought maybe we could have a coffee.

41:04.043 --> 41:06.510
I would like that.

41:16.855 --> 41:19.323
Try not to get mugged until then.

41:40.078 --> 41:43.113
You're sure you installed
it in her computer?

41:43.115 --> 41:44.982
Quite sure. What were you thinking,

41:44.984 --> 41:47.184
knocking me about like that?

41:47.186 --> 41:49.520
You're being well compensated.

41:49.522 --> 41:52.222
You're well rid of that
woman. She's a bitch.

41:52.224 --> 41:55.726
Don't call her that.

41:55.728 --> 41:58.461
Our business is finished. Go.

42:03.134 --> 42:06.503
[Sighs]

42:06.505 --> 42:07.971
<i>(Man) And have you enjoyed Hong Kong?</i>

42:07.973 --> 42:10.574
Yes, the conference
was interesting, thanks.

42:10.576 --> 42:12.609
It gave me a few thoughts on Phase One.

42:12.611 --> 42:14.144
Indeed.

42:14.146 --> 42:15.612
I'll present them to you
when we meet in New York.

42:15.614 --> 42:17.314
Get your checkbook ready.

42:17.316 --> 42:21.251
<i>We're very eager to meet
you. See you in a month.</i>

42:31.295 --> 42:32.929
Morning, sir.

42:32.931 --> 42:35.899
Just wanted to give you
a quick report on Asia.

42:35.901 --> 42:39.703
The startup in Guangzhou
and the factory in Mumbai.

42:39.705 --> 42:42.005
Oh, yes.

42:42.007 --> 42:46.309
And the seed money for
the new company in Tokyo.

42:46.311 --> 42:49.946
Elizabeth Bridges.

42:49.948 --> 42:54.484
Samaritan is becoming very
interested in her algorithms.

42:54.486 --> 42:57.353
Why?

42:57.355 --> 42:59.589
I've no idea.
