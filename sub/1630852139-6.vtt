WEBVTT

00:17.160 --> 00:19.680
I am truly, truly happy.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.280
Let's thank our Lord,
first of all.

00:23.360 --> 00:26.000
- Praise be to Him.
- And secondly, Lorena.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.200
If it hadn't been for her,
who knows where you'd be now.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.720
I'll be waiting for you
this Sunday at 5pm.

00:33.440 --> 00:34.720
Couldn't it be in the morning?

00:36.440 --> 00:39.320
No, it couldn't. Why?
We've got mass in the morning.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.040
Can't you postpone that,
for once?

00:41.120 --> 00:44.080
A nice afternoon mass,
after lunch on a full stomach.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.400
People would like it more.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.400
This is a church, not a circus.
No, we can't switch.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.600
I had it all figured out.
Be done at 6, right in time for the game.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.960
It would've been
the most memorable of days.

00:54.040 --> 00:56.000
-Sorry. In time for what?
-The game.

00:56.680 --> 00:57.920
The Captain's last match.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.320
It was at 8:45pm,
but they moved it up to 6.

01:00.440 --> 01:02.320
-Give me strength.
- What'll we do?

01:02.400 --> 01:03.880
You know
how important it is to him.

01:03.960 --> 01:08.560
I do, but I'm sorry.
My hands are tied.

01:09.120 --> 01:12.320
You either marry in the afternoon,
or in September.

01:12.720 --> 01:15.280
No way. You deal with Dad
if it comes to that.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.400
September's a no-go.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.960
Come on, don't feel down.

01:19.560 --> 01:22.560
After all, who do you love more?
Lorena or Totti?

01:22.840 --> 01:27.800
Don't. You can't ask such questions
in Rome, don't you know?

01:27.880 --> 01:29.960
Come on, give us a break.
You, at least.

01:31.480 --> 01:33.120
-Let's go.
-All right.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.000
Wait. So?

01:36.080 --> 01:37.640
-We'll do it.
-We'll do it.

01:38.920 --> 01:42.040
-Number 1, Wojciech...
-Szczęsny!

01:42.840 --> 01:46.360
-Number 2, Antonio...
-Rüdiger!

01:46.960 --> 01:50.040
-Number 20, Federico...
-Fazio!

01:50.400 --> 01:54.040
-Number 44, Kostas...
-Manōlas!

01:54.640 --> 01:57.840
-Number 33, Emerson...
-Palmieri!

01:58.000 --> 02:01.400
-Number 16, Daniele...
-De Rossi!

02:02.040 --> 02:05.040
-Number 6, Kevin...
-Strootman!

02:05.600 --> 02:09.040
-Number 11, Mohamed...
-Salah!

02:09.120 --> 02:12.840
-Number 92, Stephan...
-El Shaarawy!

02:12.920 --> 02:17.240
-Number 4, Radja...
-Nainggolan!

02:17.320 --> 02:20.840
-Number 9, Edin...
-Džeko!

02:22.000 --> 02:23.200
On the sidelines...

02:24.280 --> 02:27.960
He was born a soccer player,
grew up a myth

02:28.040 --> 02:30.160
and then, a legend.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.080
Thank you, Captain.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.920
-Number 10, Francesco...
-Totti!

02:36.000 --> 02:37.200
TOTTI: ONE CAPTAIN

02:39.480 --> 02:41.960
Those were the strangest days of my life.

02:42.880 --> 02:46.920
One week later,
I'd be a former soccer player.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.120
MAY 2017

02:51.160 --> 02:55.120
"Former soccer player".
That's the end of a whole life for me.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.880
As far as I can remember,
I've done nothing else.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.360
40 years.
Always with a ball at my feet.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.560
-All Roma fans, right?
-Yes!

03:03.680 --> 03:04.600
Just a minute.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.000
You'll keep coming
even after you quit, right?

03:08.080 --> 03:10.120
-Of course. What's your name?
-Simone.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.920
Of course I'll keep coming.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.480
But I don't want to find you here.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.640
You'll be in school.
You must recover, got it?

03:17.760 --> 03:20.320
-He gets the ball too.
-He sure does.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.160
-Do you play soccer, Simo'?
-Yes.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.200
-Bye!
-Bye!

03:28.320 --> 03:30.920
-Behave, huh?
-Bye, Totti!

03:34.360 --> 03:35.800
-They're so young.
-Yes.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.200
Boy. How old's the oldest?

03:38.680 --> 03:40.600
-13, I think.
-13, huh?

03:41.720 --> 03:44.360
I kept telling myself,
"It's no big deal."

03:44.440 --> 03:48.920
"You've been lucky, France'.
Among the luckiest in the world."

03:49.200 --> 03:50.680
"You must be happy. Period."

03:50.760 --> 03:55.160
Thank you for all you've done for us
over the years.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.360
Don't mention it.
Thank you, rather.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.920
I feel strange saying this to you...

04:03.400 --> 04:05.720
But it doesn't really matter
who needs it and why.

04:06.720 --> 04:07.760
Hang in there, huh?

04:10.920 --> 04:12.000
"Be happy."

04:13.800 --> 04:15.080
"You must be happy."

04:16.680 --> 04:17.880
Easier said than done.

04:22.280 --> 04:26.440
Who's this Rebuzzi? The father,
yes, I know him. Never heard of his son.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.920
I'll call you back. Bye.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.800
France', you've got
to give me a hand here.

04:32.880 --> 04:36.160
They're driving me crazy.
How many relatives do you have?

04:36.400 --> 04:38.080
They're crawling out the woodwork.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.520
Plus kindergarten mates,
grade school, middle school

04:41.600 --> 04:43.560
high school mates,
army service buddies.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.200
I have 10,000 ticket requests.

04:45.880 --> 04:49.120
Look. This one says he used
to give you private English lessons.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.280
Did you ever take English lessons?

04:51.360 --> 04:52.320
What do you think?

04:54.040 --> 04:56.680
Didn't think so.
Okay, we'll remove this one.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.560
Only 9,999 to go.

05:02.200 --> 05:05.600
Listen, how about a nice goodbye match

05:05.960 --> 05:07.320
with all the greatest?

05:11.840 --> 05:12.920
No, Vi'.

05:14.680 --> 05:16.520
I don't feel like dragging things out.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.680
Let it end like it has to.
With a real match.

05:23.400 --> 05:27.800
That's it.
Just one match left, a real one.

05:32.120 --> 05:35.680
We needed the win to qualify
for next year's Champions League.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.680
It was the only way
to redeem that awful season.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.760
A ticket to a cup
I wouldn't be there for.

05:50.320 --> 05:53.240
I'll get right to the point.

05:54.520 --> 06:00.040
I'd like to find a way
for you to play this last match.

06:01.520 --> 06:02.560
What do you think?

06:03.800 --> 06:04.880
What do I think?

06:07.360 --> 06:08.520
What did you have in mind?

06:08.600 --> 06:13.640
Let's make it clear. If you like,
you can play from the beginning.

06:13.720 --> 06:17.560
But if I play and we don't qualify
for the Champions League, it'll be my fault.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.040
Come on, Checco,
don't always--

06:20.120 --> 06:22.040
-Isn't that right?
-No, it is not.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.360
-Oh, no?
-No.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.360
This is your last match

06:26.440 --> 06:29.800
and I'd like you to decide
how you want this to end.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.200
You must decide.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.480
He was being nice to me now,
'cause two weeks earlier

06:33.560 --> 06:35.200
he'd pulled another one
on me.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.000
MILAN-ROMA
MAY 5TH, 2017

06:37.080 --> 06:40.920
Against Milan, in the San Siro stadium,
the so-called "Scala of soccer".

06:41.000 --> 06:43.760
The most prestigious stage
for soccer players.

06:43.840 --> 06:47.360
If it comes to violence
with the opposing side

06:47.440 --> 06:49.680
we Milan fans never back down.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.360
-Do we back down?
-Never!

06:51.760 --> 06:53.880
That doesn't mean
we lack a heart.

06:54.560 --> 06:58.080
We've got an awesome,
special choreography.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.760
We'll pull it out
just as he steps onto the field, right?

07:00.840 --> 07:01.840
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

07:04.840 --> 07:09.600
Totti's the champion
we always dreamed of having.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.040
We love him too.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.040
-What is this, linen?
-Linen.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.800
Six minutes to the end.
We're winning 3-1.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.400
The bench calls for a substitution.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.360
All of San Siro, myself included,
thinks that's where I come in

07:24.440 --> 07:27.240
that the coach will let me have
my homage from the Scala.

07:29.000 --> 07:29.880
Instead...

07:30.840 --> 07:33.360
No homage,
and no choreography.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.040
Why didn't he let him play?

07:36.880 --> 07:38.160
He's really, he's a real...

07:39.080 --> 07:40.280
-Bastard!
-Right.

07:40.360 --> 07:45.240
The point you're all forgetting
is Roma's victory.

07:45.320 --> 07:48.400
That's it. I can't stand to see him.
I can't accept it.

07:48.480 --> 07:49.440
Where are you going?

07:49.520 --> 07:51.880
Not if one player
plays five minutes more, or less.

07:52.120 --> 07:52.960
Is that clear?

07:55.720 --> 07:56.760
Coach...

07:57.760 --> 08:01.320
Do as you've always done.
Put the team first.

08:02.720 --> 08:06.840
If we're winning 4-0
before the match ends, I'll play.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.560
Otherwise, the team's
best interests come first. Right?

08:15.480 --> 08:17.600
These past two years,
he could've asked...

08:19.600 --> 08:22.520
"What do you want to do?"
"What's on your mind?"

08:23.680 --> 08:27.480
"I feel like playing this way.
What do you think?"

08:31.000 --> 08:32.640
It would have been enough for me.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.400
Everything would've been better.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.640
Why didn't he?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.240
What's the use of looking back now?

08:43.480 --> 08:45.400
-No use.
-Right.

08:46.640 --> 08:50.400
We must look ahead.
Have you thought about what you'll say?

08:52.800 --> 08:53.960
When?

08:54.040 --> 08:57.200
You said they moved it up to 6pm
to have a ceremony.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.600
You'll say something, won't you?

09:00.560 --> 09:05.520
They want me to talk now, too?
Great. My strongest suit.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.320
The top scorer award...

09:09.120 --> 09:10.440
goes to...

09:11.240 --> 09:13.320
Totti! Francesco.

09:26.480 --> 09:30.160
Well done, Francesco.
Well done. You won a prize, huh?

09:30.920 --> 09:32.360
Do you want to say something?

09:35.520 --> 09:36.480
Nothing. That's it.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.880
You could have said thank you.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.080
May I have it?

09:43.200 --> 09:48.120
And now,
the best player award goes to...

09:49.760 --> 09:51.680
Totti! Francesco.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.040
It looked like God had kept my vocal cords
in exchange for my feet.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.320
No. What should I say?

10:02.200 --> 10:03.360
A speech? Yeah.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.440
I'll say hello, I'll thank them.

10:07.400 --> 10:10.960
Say everything is fine
and then we'll go to dinner, Ila'.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.120
How many years
have you been playing?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.400
-A thousand.
-Come on.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.760
With Roma, 28 years.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.560
Isn't there anything
you wish to remember?

10:27.440 --> 10:32.240
I don't know, a special moment.
Your first game.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.560
FIRST TIME PLAYING IN SERIE A

10:40.640 --> 10:42.080
Hey, your son's phenomenal.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.400
I say he scores another two
in the second half.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.720
We'll see.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.280
-Enzo...
-Huh?

10:52.800 --> 10:54.920
-I don't see him.
-They must've subbed him out.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.680
Come on, let's go.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.480
-What about my parents?
-You'll see them. Don't worry.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.360
No, no.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.800
Something must have happened.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.960
-I feel it.
-Fiore', come on.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.880
In the last pre-game session,
a first-string player

11:14.120 --> 11:16.720
had gotten hurt,
so the coach called me in a hurry.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.160
-Hey, Fra'. You nervous?
-No, of course not.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.560
Come sit next to me.

11:32.160 --> 11:35.360
Boškov pointed
his finger at me and said...

11:35.680 --> 11:37.640
"Hey! On the field!"

11:37.720 --> 11:41.800
I was scared, it's normal. I got up
and fell while taking off my pants.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.760
I couldn't seem to take them off.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.680
That's how it started.

11:48.560 --> 11:52.160
Tuck your jersey inside your pants.
This isn't the Under-19.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.240
I couldn't do it.

11:55.800 --> 11:59.200
You're laughing,
but I feel like crying.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.560
They want me to give a speech.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.960
It's a lot if I don't faint.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.920
I'm going to take a shower.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.680
Wanna come?

12:54.600 --> 12:59.240
-He's out taking the kids to school.
-He won't answer, I'm worried.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.240
He keeps everything inside,
doesn't he?

13:02.360 --> 13:03.400
It's your mother.

13:05.880 --> 13:10.120
I'll have him call you when he's back.
Any minute now. All right?

13:13.600 --> 13:17.160
-The more he's upset, the less he speaks.
-Yes, I know.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.360
-Bye.
-Bye.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.360
-How are you?
-Everything's fine.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.160
I can see that.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.520
Am I the only one
who feels this way?

13:57.400 --> 13:58.760
I feel...

14:07.520 --> 14:09.440
It's been 30 years
of life for us, too.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.400
Family of mutes.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.640
You know how I feel,
don't you?

14:26.800 --> 14:29.960
I do, but you're the one
who has to come to terms with it.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.160
It's not easy.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.400
Then say it to me.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.560
What should I say?
You know already.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.480
-Say it.
-Honey, don't...

14:40.960 --> 14:43.640
These aren't the real tragedies of life.
Please.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.520
-But for you, it is a tragedy.
-So what?

14:45.600 --> 14:48.960
Should I tell everyone?
That I'm not ready and I'll never be?

14:49.040 --> 14:52.120
Should I tell everyone I'm afraid?
I think it's normal, isn't it?

14:52.200 --> 14:54.880
Now that the light goes off and
all turns dark, what will I do?

14:58.760 --> 15:00.760
I never thought this day would come!

15:00.840 --> 15:03.080
I always thought of it,
but I didn't think it would!

15:06.600 --> 15:10.360
Should I tell everyone
that I'm unable to grow up?

15:29.800 --> 15:32.000
-What are you doing?
-Writing. Let's write.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.200
-What are you writing?
-What you just told me.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.320
Soccer players don't write these things,
do they?

15:41.200 --> 15:42.480
What do soccer players do?

15:42.560 --> 15:44.960
I don't know,
they thank everyone

15:45.480 --> 15:47.200
say everything went well,
and leave.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.920
Sounds right to me.
We'll begin with thanks.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.200
How much Maldini
has meant and will continue to...

15:54.280 --> 15:56.800
The linesman walked 20 meters
to shake his hand.

15:56.880 --> 16:00.960
One of the greatest careers
in Italian soccer, ever.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.880
Leaving the field for the last time

16:02.960 --> 16:05.880
perhaps the most beloved player
in Italian soccer history.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.440
Surely among the most talented
of all time.

16:08.520 --> 16:13.040
Del Piero's swansong
in the Juventus Turin stadium

16:13.120 --> 16:14.560
wearing the white-and-black jersey.

16:15.800 --> 16:16.920
Who do you want to thank?

16:17.680 --> 16:18.680
Mom.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.240
Dad.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.240
Mom and Dad.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.120
Riccardo. You.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.120
You most of all.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.400
The Roma team.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.800
-The fans.
-Roma and its fans.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.840
-The fans more than anyone.
-More than me?

16:46.680 --> 16:48.040
It's different, isn't it?

16:54.800 --> 16:56.000
THANK YOU ROMA

16:59.280 --> 17:00.360
Dad?

17:11.320 --> 17:12.240
Dad?

17:22.280 --> 17:23.720
Mom, he's not here.

17:32.280 --> 17:35.240
The strangest
and worst days of my life.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.520
That's what those were.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.640
All I did was cry.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.440
Alone, like a lunatic,
so nobody would see me.

17:59.800 --> 18:00.840
Dad?

18:02.760 --> 18:04.600
Dad, lunch is ready.
Are you coming?

18:20.120 --> 18:21.800
There's pasta with beans.

18:30.400 --> 18:35.800
That same damn time
that had run like a madman for 25 years

18:36.200 --> 18:37.680
seemed to have come
to a standstill.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.960
It was over, but it wouldn't end.

18:43.680 --> 18:48.040
...Roma's captain last game
with these...

18:48.120 --> 18:51.520
...Sunday will be Totti's last,
at least as a soccer player...

18:51.600 --> 18:54.480
...very intense day. Can you imagine
the kind of emotion that will...

18:54.640 --> 18:55.520
No, thanks.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.960
It's unbelievable.

18:58.040 --> 19:01.000
There are wars going on,
bombings, robberies

19:01.080 --> 19:04.320
but everyone's talking about me.
I'm the only news in the world.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.880
-Do you feel like going out?
-Every channel.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.480
-Want some ice-cream?
-Where do you want to go? It's dark.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.840
-It's late. Are you crazy?
-It's not late.

19:18.920 --> 19:19.960
Let's go.

19:25.760 --> 19:28.040
Did you think we'd leave you alone
on your last night?

19:28.120 --> 19:29.000
Did you know?

19:29.080 --> 19:30.760
Come on, the night's still young.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.400
I have to get up early tomorrow.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.880
-Would you have slept, anyway?
-I'd have tried my best.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.880
-He has to get up early.
-Come on, let's go.

19:37.960 --> 19:38.960
I'll follow you.

20:36.480 --> 20:37.640
So beautiful.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.040
How long had it been
since you'd last seen it?

20:44.560 --> 20:45.560
A lifetime.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.080
Maybe everything will be easier now.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.400
At least that.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.120
Wow, they're big.

21:02.320 --> 21:05.720
Look at the feet.
They're a masterpiece.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.120
Look at the Captain!

21:07.200 --> 21:09.280
Are you blind?
That's not the Captain.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.240
-You got recognized.
-Impossible.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.040
France', it's not that hard.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.280
Pretend it's nothing.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.120
-They're coming.
-They're leaving.

21:18.720 --> 21:19.640
Let's go.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.040
-I'm going to trip!
-Don't!

21:27.000 --> 21:29.720
-We lost them.
-We sure did.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.720
Look how nice it is here.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.600
Lovely, huh?

22:04.880 --> 22:05.920
Thanks.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.160
For what?

22:13.480 --> 22:14.560
For everything.

23:07.160 --> 23:10.000
Here I am.
The day had come.

23:10.640 --> 23:15.000
The last of those strange,
hard, awful days.

23:17.600 --> 23:21.440
-I'm so scared.
-It's normal. I was, too.

23:21.720 --> 23:22.960
It's life-changing.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.960
No. I'm scared
of something else.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.400
Call Love of my Life #2.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.360
Calling Love of my Life #2.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.440
Honey?

23:59.520 --> 24:01.040
My last day as a soccer player.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.200
MAY 28TH, 2017

24:02.360 --> 24:07.760
The strangest. The worst.
The longest of them all.

24:23.320 --> 24:25.640
If you keep looking at the time,
it'll never pass.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.160
If I don't,
you think it'll pass quickly?

24:31.840 --> 24:34.080
No, but you won't notice as much.

24:35.800 --> 24:36.840
Distract yourself.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.120
I've been doing nothing else
since 5:30.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.240
Who is it?

25:30.320 --> 25:32.880
-It's Vito. With the program.
-This early?

25:33.120 --> 25:35.440
I told him to come earlier
'cause I had nothing to do.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.520
There's the gift from the boys.

25:43.800 --> 25:47.120
And finally, the president
will give you the framed jersey.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.000
France', please don't.

26:06.800 --> 26:07.880
By the way...

26:09.520 --> 26:12.600
Two spots freed up.
Did you know?

26:24.720 --> 26:25.640
Enzo?

26:33.640 --> 26:36.200
-What are you doing here?
-I was looking for something.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.120
Sitting in the dark.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.360
Enzo...

26:48.120 --> 26:50.240
I don't think I'll be able to come.

26:51.800 --> 26:52.840
What?

26:53.200 --> 26:54.240
You go.

26:55.480 --> 26:58.640
I'm not like you,
everything just bounces off of you.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.800
You say everything bounces
off of me.

27:04.960 --> 27:09.440
But nothing does.
It all sticks to me like glue.

27:15.600 --> 27:19.720
Then I won't go either.
I don't want you to be alone.

27:22.960 --> 27:24.040
Thank you.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.040
Reaching out your hand...

27:27.760 --> 27:29.120
to those in need...

27:30.240 --> 27:33.800
is a good Christian's first duty.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.560
The first. Don't ever forget that.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.400
And now, let us pray.

27:47.560 --> 27:48.960
What are you doing?

27:49.360 --> 27:51.240
-What are you doing?
-Ma'am, it's a wedding.

27:51.320 --> 27:52.600
I can see that.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.600
Marco, what are you doing here?

27:55.080 --> 27:58.280
-Father...
-You can't do this, you can't.

27:58.760 --> 27:59.840
Please.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.320
Father Mauro...

28:04.880 --> 28:05.800
Please.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.840
You wanted to switch.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.720
I didn't expect this from you, Lorena.
You can't switch.

28:14.520 --> 28:15.520
You're telling me?

28:16.440 --> 28:18.400
I wish the last day was the first.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.640
-Francesco's, he means.
-Yes, Francesco's, my love.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.040
Francesco's.

28:33.720 --> 28:34.720
Daddy.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.440
I'll see you there.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.760
Sure you don't want
to say bye to the kids?

28:43.840 --> 28:45.320
I managed not to cry until now.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.800
Let's pretend it's just another day.

28:54.440 --> 28:55.600
-Bye.
-Bye.

28:58.520 --> 28:59.520
See you there.

29:06.720 --> 29:09.520
Where's he going?
Where's Daddy going?

29:22.880 --> 29:23.960
Da.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.440
France', don't leave us!

29:51.600 --> 29:54.640
One Captain, there's only one Captain!

30:05.720 --> 30:10.200
One Captain, there's only one Captain!

30:37.360 --> 30:38.880
The Captain! I saw him! I saw him.

30:40.520 --> 30:43.240
-Eyes on the road, honey!
-Oh, God, the Captain. I feel sick.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.360
What did you see?
They have privacy glass.

30:45.440 --> 30:49.280
-I felt him. Like the thing, the Holy Shroud.
-The what?

30:49.560 --> 30:50.840
Don't make me regret it.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.560
All right, Father,
but don't be so negative. Come on.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.960
Wash your mouth
when you speak of such things.

30:56.040 --> 31:00.120
But it's the Captain!
Come on, Roma, come on!

31:00.200 --> 31:01.120
I saw the Captain!

31:02.000 --> 31:06.480
I'm almost there.
My journey ends here.

31:07.040 --> 31:11.040
My life will be split
into "before" and "after".

31:12.640 --> 31:13.680
For sure.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.040
Was I right or wrong?

31:16.600 --> 31:19.520
I can't say.
I can only say...

31:20.480 --> 31:21.680
it wasn't easy.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.320
It took a lot of courage.

31:26.480 --> 31:27.880
And all my heart.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.200
France'?

31:33.520 --> 31:34.720
You're not getting off?

31:52.800 --> 31:55.240
Win. We have to win.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.000
No bad ending allowed.

31:57.440 --> 31:58.680
It's my last match.

31:58.760 --> 32:02.440
Totti's moment has arrived.

32:02.520 --> 32:06.080
It's the 786th match

32:06.720 --> 32:10.760
with the Roma jersey,
for this extraordinary player.

32:10.840 --> 32:13.200
For the history of Roma.

32:13.440 --> 32:16.080
-Francesco...
-Totti!

32:16.720 --> 32:21.040
A great roar, as if we'd scored a goal!
So much emotion.

32:21.120 --> 32:24.120
I'm playing 36 minutes.
A luxury, these days

32:24.520 --> 32:27.560
but peanuts if I think
that there will be no more.

32:27.640 --> 32:33.680
I'm seeing more cell phones
than spectators, recording this for history.

32:33.800 --> 32:38.160
25 years with the same team.
Our Captain!

32:38.720 --> 32:40.920
It would be wonderful
if I scored.

32:41.520 --> 32:44.440
The Champions League
could be my last gift to Roma.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.000
Soccer's last gift to me.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.200
Strootman with the soft touch...

32:49.480 --> 32:51.920
aiming for Džeko,
who passes backwards to--

32:52.480 --> 32:55.800
It's a goal! Goal! Goal! Goal!

32:55.880 --> 32:58.440
Roma is in the lead
with Daniele De Rossi!

32:58.520 --> 32:59.600
But that's fine, too.

32:59.880 --> 33:02.560
Roma is in the lead!
That's our Daniele!

33:02.640 --> 33:05.880
He goes and gets a corner kick.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.920
Now the great champion
knows what to do.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.200
He could simply make a cross
but decided not to.

33:13.840 --> 33:17.080
That's my role, stalling for time.
Even if I have none left.

33:18.200 --> 33:21.560
Until the end of the match,
of my career

33:23.760 --> 33:24.760
of my whole life.

33:24.840 --> 33:29.600
Totti again. Yes!
Roma's going to the Champions League!

33:29.680 --> 33:32.080
Right up to the last minute,
the last breath.

33:32.160 --> 33:35.600
The team goes for a group hug.
What a moment.

33:36.640 --> 33:41.040
87 points this season,
a team record.

33:41.960 --> 33:45.080
Francesco Totti's time has come.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.000
France', here we go.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.760
I hoped you were the president.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.920
-Telling you it was all a prank?
-Yeah.

34:31.480 --> 34:37.480
Everyone stand.
The Captain's coming.

35:07.640 --> 35:10.280
I want to dedicate
this letter to all of you.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.480
To the children
that cheered for me

35:12.840 --> 35:15.240
to yesterday's children
who have now grown up

35:15.320 --> 35:17.360
and may have become fathers

35:17.600 --> 35:20.560
and to those of you today
who maybe are shouting "Totti goal".

35:49.920 --> 35:52.560
But at a certain time in life,
we must grow up.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.520
That's what they said to me:

35:57.640 --> 35:58.960
"Time has decided."

36:00.640 --> 36:01.760
That damned time.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.080
The same time...

36:06.760 --> 36:11.160
we wished had hurtled past
on June 17th, 2001.

36:24.280 --> 36:28.000
Today time has come
to tap on my shoulder and say:

36:28.680 --> 36:31.320
"We've got to grow up.
As of tomorrow, you will be an adult.

36:32.480 --> 36:37.040
Take off yours shorts and boots
because as of today, you are a man

36:37.120 --> 36:40.640
and will no longer smell
the grass under your feet."

36:47.960 --> 36:49.040
Today it's really over.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.040
I'll take off my jersey for the last time.

36:56.040 --> 37:00.120
I'll fold it well, even though
I'm not ready to say "it's over"

37:00.200 --> 37:01.560
and maybe I never will.

37:13.200 --> 37:19.040
I apologize for not giving interviews
or saying what I thought, recently.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.120
But it's hard to turn the light off.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.520
Now I am afraid.

37:32.480 --> 37:36.680
I'll go down to the locker room

37:36.760 --> 37:42.040
that welcomed me as a little boy,
and I now leave as a man.

37:42.920 --> 37:48.400
I am proud and happy I shared
28 years of love with you.

37:59.600 --> 38:00.680
I love you!

39:27.120 --> 39:28.160
President.

39:30.440 --> 39:31.760
It can't end this way.

39:32.720 --> 39:33.760
One more year...

39:35.520 --> 39:36.720
Then we'll see.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.120
-For real?
-For real.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.760
I'll sign it.

The time has come for the Captain,
our Captain...
