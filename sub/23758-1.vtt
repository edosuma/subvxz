Abdullah!

getting their pizza, are they?

- Cos you're shutting down.

06:47.236 --> 06:48.485
Did you see anything?

06:48.923 --> 06:50.587
He gave us our pizza.

06:50.674 --> 06:52.008
And then I closed the door.

Reaction?

07:09.848 --> 07:11.991
To what happened. I think it was fear.

- Two.

08:03.907 --> 08:05.811

nothing to do with it.

All right, if you have to know,
the baby's not my husband's.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.794
- Are you arresting me for that?
- Did the pizza man say anything?

08:16.317 --> 08:19.703

him the tip, no, nothing at all.

- Yeah.

- That's all?
- Then he went.

08:25.497 --> 08:26.914
Do you have the receipt?

08:26.976 --> 08:29.151
- Did you pay cash?

we never even made it to bed,

09:13.592 --> 09:15.883
you had to take a call from your leader.

09:15.986 --> 09:17.150
Tell me about it.

09:17.304 --> 09:19.695
And then tonight, like the last time,

09:20.062 --> 09:23.797
I'm sitting in a restaurant,
eating fucking breadsticks.

09:24.553 --> 09:25.852
You don't even call me.

09:25.892 --> 09:28.723
I tried. The reception's terrible.

decide what you want.

09:32.410 --> 09:35.137
Has it never occurred to you that
Labour may not even get back?

What I'm saying,
I thought there was a rota.

09:55.245 --> 09:58.244
- Sort of a rota.
- Meaning what exactly?

09:58.269 --> 10:01.094
- People take turns.
- So it was Mikey's turn?

10:01.119 --> 10:02.722
- Yeah.
- In fact, you'd already told him,

10:02.744 --> 10:05.134
you go to Bramham Gardens
with a quattro formaggio.

10:05.182 --> 10:06.349
Yeah.

10:06.478 --> 10:09.244
So why did you decide not to send him?

10:09.407 --> 10:12.244
I changed my mind. I sent Abdullah.
I can do what I want.

10:12.269 --> 10:14.166
- I know.
- I am in charge.

10:14.305 --> 10:18.220
I understand that.
My question is, why did you do it?

10:18.627 --> 10:19.847
Why?

10:21.051 --> 10:22.900
Abdullah was killed delivering a pizza.

10:24.245 --> 10:26.080
I don't know anything about that.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.430
I'm not saying you do.
I'm not accusing you of murder.

10:29.455 --> 10:31.760
However, the murderer was waiting.

10:31.971 --> 10:33.971
Why didn't you send Mikey?

10:38.572 --> 10:40.906
I'm asking, is the system random?

10:42.245 --> 10:44.555
How could a gunman know
who he was going to kill?

10:44.747 --> 10:46.912
And if he wanted to kill
anyone in particular,

10:46.913 --> 10:49.133
was it just chance that you
changed your mind?

10:49.245 --> 10:50.976
Well?

10:51.463 --> 10:52.757
I don't know.

10:54.409 --> 10:56.335
Did you see anyone outside?
Anyone following him?

10:56.359 --> 10:58.249
- No.
- Was there a reason?

10:58.332 --> 11:00.197
Was there a reason
that you sent Abdullah?

11:00.253 --> 11:02.011
He hadn't had a run all night.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.042
Abdullah hadn't had a run all night.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.503
- So you felt sorry for him?
- Yeah.

11:05.557 --> 11:07.394
You sent him out of the goodness
of your heart?

11:11.264 --> 11:13.095
Who owns this place?

11:13.167 --> 11:14.167
I manage it.

11:14.402 --> 11:15.825
I know that.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.479
- The owner changed.
- When?

11:19.190 --> 11:20.934
Last month.
I've never even spoken to him.

11:22.721 --> 11:24.364
They're in Boca Raton.

11:25.473 --> 11:28.403
Right. So this is a south London
pizza parlour

11:28.456 --> 11:30.456
owned by a man in Boca Raton?

11:31.831 --> 11:33.315
Yeah.

11:51.913 --> 11:53.808
This is Mikey Gowans.

11:54.913 --> 11:56.244
Yeah, we met.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.831
Mikey's just realised
it might have been him.

12:01.245 --> 12:02.816
Mikey, you're going to have to tell us

12:02.841 --> 12:04.245
why anyone might want to kill you.

12:08.245 --> 12:10.244
Look, it doesn't make any sense.

12:10.643 --> 12:12.478
Are you sure about that?

12:15.252 --> 12:16.919
Did you know Abdullah?

12:17.233 --> 12:18.565
Not really.

12:19.001 --> 12:20.457
Did you know his second name?

12:21.121 --> 12:23.949
He'd just started. I think...

12:24.245 --> 12:27.012
- I think he was Syrian or something.
- Syrian?

12:27.574 --> 12:29.244
Mm, that's what he said.

12:29.339 --> 12:30.568
How do you get paid?

12:32.221 --> 12:33.221
By the delivery.

12:33.716 --> 12:35.235
Cash?

12:35.282 --> 12:37.447
- Yeah.
- Any paperwork?

12:38.245 --> 12:40.245
It's not a paperwork kind of place.

12:42.831 --> 12:44.244
What did you do before?

12:44.823 --> 12:47.635
I was a bouncer. In a night-club.

12:47.721 --> 12:48.841
Till I got hit.

12:48.995 --> 12:50.042
Which night-club?

12:50.128 --> 12:51.245
The Turbine.

12:51.676 --> 12:53.675
Then I'm not surprised you got hit.

12:56.510 --> 12:58.799
Rakhee, take Mr Gowans
back to the station?

12:59.198 --> 13:00.588
I'm going to the scene.

13:42.143 --> 13:43.474
Can I say something?

13:45.245 --> 13:47.091
Yeah, you can say whatever you like.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.245
The system is the system.

13:51.245 --> 13:53.244
Disliking it isn't going to change it.

13:53.674 --> 13:56.674
It carries on, regardless
of what you feel about it.

13:57.928 --> 14:01.505
And what has that got to do
with my being late for a date?

14:03.073 --> 14:04.073
You know,

14:04.246 --> 14:06.244
you're a really nice man, David,

14:06.349 --> 14:10.245
but you are so lost in things
that you can't do anything about.

14:11.385 --> 14:14.220
You no longer have any idea
who you actually are.

14:15.338 --> 14:18.338
Where are you going? Just stay.

14:20.605 --> 14:21.971
No.

14:22.472 --> 14:24.105
I can't stay here.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.105
Come on, you'll feel
differently in the morning.

14:26.558 --> 14:28.245
I don't think so.

14:29.245 --> 14:32.084
Well, at least let me order you a cab.

14:32.115 --> 14:33.245
Oh, for fuck's sake.

makes you angry,

- Amusing.
- Something else odd.

What?

16:45.062 --> 16:47.391
So, you know I spoke to Karen Mars,
the woman who ordered the pizza?

16:47.414 --> 16:49.220
- Well?
- She talked about her baby.

16:49.245 --> 16:50.625
She said "Oh, she doesn't come into it."

16:50.649 --> 16:51.741

"She doesn't come into it",
what does she mean by that?

16:53.636 --> 16:55.244
What did she mean by it?

16:57.855 --> 16:59.199
was just murdered outside her door,

16:59.246 --> 17:01.432
and, as a mother,
she feels her baby was not involved.

17:01.457 --> 17:02.493
That's probably what she meant.

17:02.518 --> 17:04.243
"She doesn't come into it",
it's an odd way to put it.

- No, it's a killing.

17:21.221 --> 17:22.996
Why didn't they kill him on the way in?

17:23.127 --> 17:25.127
Why did they wait
till he was on his way out?

17:25.244 --> 17:28.918
I'm just saying, they could've
killed him five minutes earlier.

17:29.114 --> 17:30.912
You need to go on
a communications course.

17:30.913 --> 17:31.956
Why?

17:31.981 --> 17:33.622
That's not how to handle
public relations.

17:33.647 --> 17:34.647
They write what they want.

17:34.672 --> 17:36.849
Do you think being nice to
them makes any difference?

17:36.896 --> 17:39.341
It's true what he's saying, though.
Why wait?

17:39.380 --> 17:41.411
It means we've got a calm killer.

17:41.466 --> 17:43.786
Semi-automatic. Two rounds of two.

17:43.841 --> 17:46.244
Each time with perfect accuracy
at 20 yards.

17:46.245 --> 17:47.317
We're thinking a professional?

17:47.349 --> 17:49.778
- Maybe a robbery gone wrong.
- Robbing what?

17:49.835 --> 17:51.294
Pizza drivers are the most-robbed

17:51.344 --> 17:52.786
people in London, do you know that?

17:52.841 --> 17:54.746
- What about drugs?
- You tell me.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.493
There was a witness in the street
but a long way away.

17:57.548 --> 17:58.666
Is that her?

17:58.704 --> 18:01.486
Hanh Giang. Make of her what you can.

18:01.548 --> 18:02.721
She was in a K-hole.

18:02.746 --> 18:05.184
- Where had she been?
- She says taking a walk.

18:05.245 --> 18:06.920
We asked her to turn out her pockets.

18:06.974 --> 18:09.108
- Is that all she had?
- It's enough.

18:09.161 --> 18:10.350
Does she have a description?

18:10.412 --> 18:11.842
Thin. Average height.

18:11.897 --> 18:14.576
She only saw him for a second,
she said his face was obscured.

18:14.623 --> 18:17.249
- Obscured by?
- She says a diving suit.

18:17.311 --> 18:19.983
- How stoned was she?
- More likely some sort of balaclava.

18:20.054 --> 18:22.244
What she saw was the hood.
Round his face.

18:22.245 --> 18:23.640
Have a look at this gate.

18:23.702 --> 18:26.168
Good chance our killer went over there.

18:26.237 --> 18:27.902
- Any footprints?
- No, nothing.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.097
Who's the SIO?

18:29.152 --> 18:30.496
Kip Glaspie.

18:30.566 --> 18:32.332
I'm the new area forensic manager.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.207
My name's Gupta. People call me Fuzz.

18:34.262 --> 18:36.013
I don't think this scene's going
to make you happy.

18:36.076 --> 18:37.693
- Really? Why not?
- The witness saw something.

18:37.748 --> 18:39.245
Sounds like the guy may have
been wearing rubber.

18:39.287 --> 18:40.746
He's a professional, then?

18:40.998 --> 18:43.208
Never mind.
Every contact leaves a trace.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.609
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

18:44.633 --> 18:46.422
Weren't you an athlete?
Didn't you do pole vault or something?

18:46.476 --> 18:47.711
Yeah. I jumped for a while.

18:47.750 --> 18:49.492
Wasn't there some
kind of famous incident?

18:49.539 --> 18:51.220
Yeah. She landed badly.

18:51.307 --> 18:53.946
Still. Kip Glaspie. Pretty impressive.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.425
You're Hanh Giang?

18:59.797 --> 19:02.113
- Yeah.
- Where did you get this?

19:02.371 --> 19:04.220
Uh, I went to a club.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.244
Do you have any ID?

19:06.361 --> 19:09.080
- Uh, not on me, no.
- Do you have any at home?

19:09.245 --> 19:11.065
- Yeah.
- Where's home?

19:11.135 --> 19:13.268
Uh... Stockwell Park Road.

19:13.565 --> 19:14.729
Okay.

19:14.784 --> 19:17.808
Someone's going to take you
down there in a few moments, okay?

19:18.245 --> 19:21.175
As far as we can tell,
you're the sole witness to a murder.

19:21.385 --> 19:24.052
When your brain is
functioning again, think back.

19:24.202 --> 19:26.757
Think about if there's anything
that you might have overlooked.

19:26.803 --> 19:28.054
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

19:28.078 --> 19:29.244
Okay.

19:29.874 --> 19:31.533
Come in first thing tomorrow morning.

19:31.593 --> 19:32.580
Thank you.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.244
Abdullah's phone.

19:36.463 --> 19:37.963
Tell me.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.987
I went into "frequent locations".

19:40.080 --> 19:42.244
I'm thinking if that's work,
that's home.

19:42.245 --> 19:44.186

What are you doing here?

21:02.637 --> 21:04.227
Well, it's my constituency, Rob.

21:04.270 --> 21:07.026
- Is that the only reason?
- What do you know?

21:07.104 --> 21:09.370
They're saying it's a hate crime.
Immigrant shot in the street.

21:09.416 --> 21:11.330
I'd love a quote if you can give me one.

21:11.706 --> 21:13.448
David Mars.

21:16.230 --> 21:18.137
Is everything all right? What happened?

21:18.245 --> 21:21.488
Sorry. I didn't mean to call.
I got frightened, that's all.

21:24.245 --> 21:26.130
I don't understand.

21:26.325 --> 21:28.872
Well, I won't say it again.
It was me who ordered the pizza.

21:28.897 --> 21:31.116
- Did you hear the shot?
- Of course I heard it.

21:31.163 --> 21:32.645
Quite like old times.

21:32.700 --> 21:34.653
You were the last person
to speak to him?

21:34.724 --> 21:36.269
Well, I suppose.

21:38.245 --> 21:40.683
I don't get it,
you don't seem very upset.

21:40.738 --> 21:42.293
I thought I had a bottle of wine.

21:42.370 --> 21:43.964
I must have drunk it.

21:46.892 --> 21:48.557
Is that a new shirt?

21:51.913 --> 21:54.244
You called me to come over here.

21:54.384 --> 21:59.139
Sorry if that was a drag!
I'm sure you're busy.

21:59.194 --> 22:00.460
Don't worry about it.

22:00.523 --> 22:02.671
Too busy for the mother of your child.

22:02.718 --> 22:06.924
- Karen, you know that is not fair.
- I know what you're thinking...

22:06.932 --> 22:09.190
I was only married to her
for three months,

22:09.245 --> 22:12.019
am I going to have to look
after her for the rest of my life?

22:12.073 --> 22:15.244
- Four. Four months.
- Well, the answer is yes.

22:15.292 --> 22:18.036
Yes, for the rest of your life.
Get used to it.

(HE SIGHS)

22:19.643 --> 22:21.333
What's that?

22:22.848 --> 22:26.432
This is a letter somebody wrote to me.

22:26.979 --> 22:30.206
You mean, as in the 19th century,
that kind of letter?

22:30.295 --> 22:32.518
Don't politicians have e-mail?

22:35.469 --> 22:38.378
Well, you seem in good shape.
All things considered.

22:38.432 --> 22:39.432
You've had a shock.

22:39.457 --> 22:41.455
Well, that's why I called you, David.

22:41.721 --> 22:44.461
Do you mind staying over?
For Elfie's sake?

23:11.698 --> 23:13.697
Don't look at me like that.
You chose this job.

23:13.754 --> 23:15.810
- You could have done anything.
- I was a teacher.

23:15.841 --> 23:18.201
- I gave it up, remember?
- Why?

23:18.668 --> 23:21.204
- Too violent.

23:33.081 --> 23:34.246
Home?

23:40.237 --> 23:42.238
- Do you want me to do it?
- No. I'm good.

23:51.129 --> 23:53.128
We're from the police.

23:55.651 --> 23:57.651
Can you tell me your names?

24:02.596 --> 24:04.596
Do either of you speak English?

24:11.220 --> 24:14.876
We were just called to a situation
not far from here.

24:15.448 --> 24:17.806
Do either of you know Abdullah Asif?

24:23.393 --> 24:25.392
I'm going to assume
you understand a little,

24:25.438 --> 24:27.047
while we get someone here to help.

24:27.633 --> 24:31.031
As I said, we were just called to
an incident nearby,

24:32.141 --> 24:34.245
where a male has been shot in the chest.

24:38.182 --> 24:40.182
We believe it to be Abdullah Asif.

24:51.604 --> 24:53.592
You shared a space with him
so we're going to need

24:53.648 --> 24:55.217
to see your paperwork,

24:55.672 --> 24:59.321
whatever you've got,
any documents you happen to have.

24:59.397 --> 25:01.818
It doesn't matter what they are,
what language.

25:01.897 --> 25:03.559
I'm going to get an interpreter

25:03.705 --> 25:05.606
and we're going to ask you
some questions.

25:07.229 --> 25:08.897
We're here to help.

25:14.338 --> 25:16.338
For now, all I can say is sorry.

25:22.747 --> 25:24.586
That's how it ends up, is it?

25:24.913 --> 25:26.906
Escape war, make your way to England

25:26.961 --> 25:29.062
and start your new life in a garage?

25:29.245 --> 25:30.912
That's the best we can offer, is it?

25:30.983 --> 25:32.422
Well, we've seen it before.

25:32.594 --> 25:35.399
Yeah, we've seen it before.
Doesn't make it better, though, does it?

25:37.135 --> 25:38.135
No views?

25:38.246 --> 25:40.244
Oh, yeah, I've got a view, two hours in

25:40.245 --> 25:42.090
and things are already out of control.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.755
What are you getting?

26:21.913 --> 26:24.661
At first glance, absolutely nothing.

26:24.794 --> 26:26.244
Footprints?

26:26.317 --> 26:28.895
I knew the moment I came.
You can always tell.

26:29.864 --> 26:31.221
It's a set up.

26:31.612 --> 26:34.455
Look... Perfect place to hide,
perfect darkness,

26:34.526 --> 26:37.635
giving him a perfect view across
the street, perfect getaway.

26:38.159 --> 26:39.517
They want it to look random
but it isn't,

26:39.573 --> 26:41.385
there's nothing random about it.

27:36.913 --> 27:38.244
First thing tomorrow.

27:38.245 --> 27:39.747
Yeah. Thank you.

28:58.166 --> 29:00.166
Where have you been?

29:04.245 --> 29:05.245
I was out.

29:08.479 --> 29:10.479
It's three o'clock in the morning.

29:13.018 --> 29:14.853
Were you with someone else?

29:18.401 --> 29:20.016
I want you to tell me.

29:20.758 --> 29:22.392
Honestly. I...
I'd rather know the truth.

29:22.438 --> 29:24.642
- I wasn't with anyone!
- Then what were you doing?

29:24.709 --> 29:26.454
I'm not gonna tell you if
you're going to get angry.

29:26.478 --> 29:28.478
I won't get angry. Even if...

29:30.245 --> 29:31.438
Look, you're free.

29:33.224 --> 29:35.485
You can do what you want.
Of course you can.

29:38.245 --> 29:40.071
I wanted to get high.

29:40.245 --> 29:41.672
And did you?

29:41.747 --> 29:44.244
Yeah. I needed some air.

29:44.579 --> 29:46.244
I need some space.

29:46.580 --> 29:48.248
You can be so clingy.

29:50.768 --> 29:52.768

thing in my life.

Something's happened.
Just tell me what's happened.

30:03.245 --> 30:05.245
- I went to a club.
- Which club?

30:06.605 --> 30:08.332
I can guess.

30:09.245 --> 30:11.359
And then I walk home
and I felt quite weird.

30:11.429 --> 30:13.320
So I sit down on the pavement and...

30:13.765 --> 30:15.554
I don't know how long I'm there.

30:17.245 --> 30:18.546
And?

30:19.077 --> 30:21.487
Someone got shot dead,
across the street.

30:21.568 --> 30:22.982
A pizza man.

30:23.060 --> 30:24.166
Fuck!

30:24.246 --> 30:26.245
And then the police arrive and...

30:29.245 --> 30:30.845
I was frightened, I panicked and...

30:30.892 --> 30:32.244
- You spoke to them?
- Yeah.

30:32.315 --> 30:33.650
They emptied my pocket.

30:35.245 --> 30:36.580
And what did they find?

30:39.534 --> 30:41.534
- Ketamine. MDMA.
- (SIGHS)

I was scared.

30:44.386 --> 30:45.950

30:48.245 --> 30:50.223
But I didn't give them my real name.

30:51.221 --> 30:53.060
- You made up a name?
- Yeah, and address.

30:53.128 --> 30:54.615
Why did you do that?

30:54.817 --> 30:56.145
Why do you think?

30:56.224 --> 30:58.224
If they know who I am, I'm in trouble.

31:00.607 --> 31:02.245
I panic.

31:03.522 --> 31:05.244
I was terrified.

31:05.533 --> 31:07.107
I don't want to go home.

31:08.747 --> 31:10.245
I want to live in England.

I know.

People do.

31:22.379 --> 31:24.220
Also, there's something else.

31:24.427 --> 31:26.990
Something I didn't dare tell them,
cos...

31:27.185 --> 31:28.580
Cos I was off my head.

31:31.361 --> 31:33.361
I told them the killer had a hood on.

31:34.338 --> 31:36.006
- And that was true?
- Yeah.

31:37.338 --> 31:39.338
But what I didn't say is...

31:40.339 --> 31:41.985
I thought it was a woman.

do we know they're his sisters?

They're paperless.

lie about that?

34:51.860 --> 34:53.245
Of course you know.

34:54.453 --> 34:57.244
Think of it her way.
Her brother's just been killed.

34:57.245 --> 34:58.539
She doesn't know who to trust.

34:58.586 --> 35:00.244
Look, can you tell her
we understand she's in grief,

35:00.245 --> 35:02.164
but she has to stop fucking about
and tell us the truth?

35:28.245 --> 35:29.605

Her brother is dead.

- Not much.
- In the all-female environment?

36:44.989 --> 36:48.063
What we did discover...
turns out they lived in Aleppo.

36:48.117 --> 36:49.664
They worked in a tourist hotel.

36:49.758 --> 36:51.453
In Aleppo? Well, that's a triumph.

36:51.485 --> 36:53.516
Sure. Before it was destroyed.

36:53.580 --> 36:55.220
Abdullah was on reception.

36:55.245 --> 36:57.438
They feared for their lives in Syria.

36:57.469 --> 36:59.219
The war is never going to end.

37:00.039 --> 37:02.688
Assad's a ruthless dictator
who'd rather see his country

37:02.758 --> 37:04.244
destroyed than yield power.

37:04.245 --> 37:05.245
That's their view, is it?

37:05.246 --> 37:07.858
It's Fatima's. Mona's not speaking.

37:07.913 --> 37:09.246
- Nothing?
- Not a word.

37:09.311 --> 37:12.163
They're what our leaders call
genuine asylum seekers.

37:12.245 --> 37:14.007
They had to get out or they'd be killed.

37:14.068 --> 37:15.594
So she'll give us her political views,

37:15.618 --> 37:16.976
but she won't actually
give us any names,

37:17.001 --> 37:19.156
like who got her here,
how her brother found his job.

37:19.181 --> 37:20.220
Why not?

37:20.245 --> 37:22.750
- Because they're frightened.
- What, frightened of us?

37:22.913 --> 37:24.140
No.

37:24.245 --> 37:27.539
More like one of them's been killed
and they're asking who's next.

37:27.695 --> 37:29.245
They don't feel safe.

37:30.825 --> 37:32.247
You should go back
to the station with them.

37:32.286 --> 37:33.739
- We're going to need you later.
- Okay.

37:35.245 --> 37:36.997
What do you want to do now?

37:37.153 --> 37:38.630
Can we just think this thing through?

37:38.692 --> 37:41.165
- Please.
- Can we?

37:41.493 --> 37:44.708
Like normally how you have
a body and then you work out

37:44.733 --> 37:47.046
who they are and who might
want to kill them.

37:47.123 --> 37:49.452
- Yeah? That's the procedure?
- If you say so.

37:49.491 --> 37:51.013
Only as I understand it.

37:51.391 --> 37:53.498
Let me know if I'm going
too fast for you.

37:53.641 --> 37:56.669
This time we don't know
who's meant to have been killed.

37:56.732 --> 37:57.919
Yeah, I'm onto that.

37:57.966 --> 38:00.395
So working out why seems
more than normally difficult.

38:00.667 --> 38:01.707
That's very good.

38:01.731 --> 38:03.731
You've got your speech ready
for the superintendent.

38:05.245 --> 38:06.606
Anything to add?

38:06.842 --> 38:08.327
Nothing. You?

38:09.960 --> 38:11.081
Yeah.

38:11.850 --> 38:14.894
There's nobody here. Nobody except us.

38:14.919 --> 38:17.187
- Why would there be?
- Because these people are Syrian.

38:17.618 --> 38:19.617
- So?
- They're Syrian.

38:19.775 --> 38:22.345
What I'm asking, where's MI5?
Where's counter-terrorism?

38:22.384 --> 38:23.523
Where are they?

38:23.547 --> 38:25.068
Yeah. Anything of this nature
from the region,

38:25.093 --> 38:27.171
they're like flies round dead meat.
Why aren't they here?

38:27.245 --> 38:29.245
My guess is they're still in bed.

38:45.213 --> 38:47.592
Okay, it seems we're finished with you.

38:47.647 --> 38:48.881
Do you want to go?

38:48.943 --> 38:50.245
I can't sleep here?

38:50.447 --> 38:51.674
It's not a hotel.

38:53.674 --> 38:55.674
I'm just a bit shaky, that's all.

38:56.323 --> 38:58.132
I'd got to know Abdullah a bit.

38:58.506 --> 38:59.713
And?

38:59.738 --> 39:01.737
He was a decent bloke, I liked him.

39:03.393 --> 39:04.991
And?

39:05.245 --> 39:07.116
That's what I wanted to say.

seven immigration bills</i>

40:04.177 --> 40:05.654
in the last eight years,

45,000 changes to those
immigration rules since 2010.

40:09.128 --> 40:10.143
- That's right.
- And...

40:10.198 --> 40:12.674
Labour has
opposed many of those changes.

40:13.017 --> 40:16.010
We support control of our borders
and we always have.

40:16.049 --> 40:17.372

40:18.705 --> 40:21.075
you seem to be taking
a different approach.

40:21.245 --> 40:24.595
Well, sometimes, in the past,
Labour's given an impression

40:24.650 --> 40:28.220
of caring more for newcomers
than for the resident population.

40:28.401 --> 40:29.720
That was wrong.

- She lost her job.

Yeah, well, look at it

into detail about how they got here.

- Why take the risk?
- We're finding that already.

- I'm wondering if she's pregnant.
- Really?

Well, you'd know.

dragged out of them.

give us some professional advice.

and I don't want to lose her.

45:48.198 --> 45:50.197
- Christ.
- Please don't use that word.

45:50.245 --> 45:52.779
I love swearing, I hate blasphemy.
I really hate it.

45:52.807 --> 45:55.287
If that makes me
a fucking hypocrite, so be it.

45:56.886 --> 45:58.885
Do you love her more than me?

45:58.978 --> 46:00.977
You were an episode.

46:01.048 --> 46:02.245
She's a whole chapter.

46:02.439 --> 46:04.424
Or she was going to be.

46:11.537 --> 46:14.217
(CHATTER)

46:15.229 --> 46:17.003
- David.
- Linh.

46:17.245 --> 46:20.034
Jane thought you might have
a minute for a chat.

46:20.274 --> 46:22.762
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

46:27.747 --> 46:29.634
Jane told me what happened.

46:31.337 --> 46:34.012
You've got no choice,
you have to go into the station.

46:34.057 --> 46:36.989
Not going in will only make
matters worse.

46:37.096 --> 46:38.872
Yeah, I know.

46:39.245 --> 46:42.184
And Jane says you have vital evidence.

46:42.209 --> 46:43.441
You thought it was a woman.

46:43.515 --> 46:44.831
You've got to tell them that.

46:46.448 --> 46:48.784
There is one other thing, David.

46:50.842 --> 46:51.856
Tell me.

46:53.245 --> 46:55.244
Well, you remember
you signed her application?

46:55.245 --> 46:56.957
To renew her student visa. I do.

46:56.958 --> 46:58.220
Are you still at that stupid college?

46:58.245 --> 47:00.696
- Sometimes.
- Oh, only sometimes?

47:00.751 --> 47:02.728
It's a legitimate
place of education, David,

47:02.767 --> 47:03.746
it's approved by the DoE.

47:03.747 --> 47:06.244
Oh, well, in that case,
that's a stamp of excellence.

47:06.245 --> 47:08.962
What's it called, Kennington Poly?

47:10.593 --> 47:14.133
But what we didn't tell you,
when I asked you to sign...

47:14.781 --> 47:18.054
Her first student visa
had already expired.

47:20.664 --> 47:23.297
- What? Hang on.
- I didn't think to mention it.

47:23.329 --> 47:25.322
- You mean she's here illegally?
- It's a grey area.

47:25.385 --> 47:27.807
Jane, I'm a fucking MP. I signed.

47:27.853 --> 47:30.358
- You didn't sign it knowingly.
- No! Because you didn't tell me!

47:30.389 --> 47:32.467
- Well, we're telling you now.
- Oh, thank you very much!

47:32.522 --> 47:34.245
Fuck! Jane!

47:34.732 --> 47:36.220
How could you do that!?

47:36.319 --> 47:38.116
You see, that's why it's difficult.

47:38.182 --> 47:40.182
You see why she doesn't want to
talk to the police?

47:44.917 --> 47:46.917
(GROANS)

47:52.181 --> 47:54.079
Give that a look over, will you?

47:54.245 --> 47:56.079
Do you want to slip home?

47:56.164 --> 47:58.465
- I can take over for a while.
- Bit late for that, isn't it?

47:58.563 --> 47:59.789
Where are you off to?

47:59.898 --> 48:03.087
I thought, one more word
with our friends.

48:09.747 --> 48:12.105
Look, I don't have
any say in the matter.

48:12.362 --> 48:14.362
You may well be detained.

48:15.245 --> 48:17.080
After that, you may be sent home.

48:18.523 --> 48:20.890
You should take the chance to talk,

48:21.164 --> 48:23.609
right now, today.

Bogged down in bureaucracy

No.

The... the police are all over us.

50:21.849 --> 50:24.555
Yeah, but have you got what we want?

Not yet.
