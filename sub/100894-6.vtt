01:15.700 --> 01:17.535
-I wanna hear about the party.
-Mm.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.163
-Tell me everything.
-[chuckles]

01:20.246 --> 01:21.372
Everything, huh?

01:22.457 --> 01:23.958
Well, that could take a while.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.961
We gotta get ready for church.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.296
Tell me if you had fun.

01:29.464 --> 01:30.840
Yes, I did.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.594
More fun than I've had in a long time.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.680
-[knock at door]
-[Dana Sue] Annie.

01:40.266 --> 01:43.603
Annabelle Lenore Sullivan,
you are not still in bed!

01:43.686 --> 01:45.146
Come on, get up.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.566
Hey! We all had a late night.
It is time for church, young lady.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.902
I'm not kidding around.
Get up and get moving.

01:50.985 --> 01:52.362
I don't want to be late.

01:52.445 --> 01:55.031
[Annie] Fine, I'm getting up.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.120
-Annabelle!
-[knocks on door]

02:00.954 --> 02:02.455
We leave in 15.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.749
[groaning] Okay.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.045
[groans]

02:23.268 --> 02:24.519
[Annie's voice] <i>You're amazing.</i>

02:26.187 --> 02:27.480
<i>And that kiss…</i>

02:30.608 --> 02:32.360
<i>Oops! But, for real,</i>

02:32.944 --> 02:35.488
<i>best kiss </i>ever.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.908
<i>-I get why they say you fall.</i>
-No.

02:39.701 --> 02:40.577
<i>You,</i>

02:41.035 --> 02:45.456
<i>-love emoji, kiss emoji, send.</i>
-No. No.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.419
[retching]

02:53.965 --> 02:56.759
[church bells ringing]

03:02.807 --> 03:04.475
Hey, Kyle, go round up your sister.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.436
I want you all to be ready
when your daddy gets here.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.146
-Okay.
-I'll find Katie.

03:15.695 --> 03:16.529
You okay?

03:19.741 --> 03:20.742
Oh, wow.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.702
-Don't look now, Maddie.
-[laughing]

03:22.785 --> 03:24.621
Someone's straight-up glowing!

03:24.704 --> 03:25.747
Yeah!

03:25.830 --> 03:26.748
Oh, am I? Oh.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.917
So, where is Mr. Wonderful?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.044
Oh, he had to catch a flight last night.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.296
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Oh, don't be, child.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.007
He turned around
before he got to the airport

03:36.090 --> 03:39.427
and came on back, and then caught
the first flight out this morning.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.095
Oh, goodness, wow!

03:41.179 --> 03:44.933
[laughs] Well, while we are reviewing
last night's activities

03:45.016 --> 03:46.726
on the church lawn,

03:46.809 --> 03:49.395
that was a nice little dance

03:49.479 --> 03:51.105
that you and Coach Cal shared.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.733
-Well, that wasn't all we shared.
-[gasps]

03:53.816 --> 03:56.152
-Are you kidding?
-Our first kiss!

03:56.653 --> 03:58.655
-Maddie!
-Details, give it up.

03:58.738 --> 03:59.948
It was good.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.991
-It was just...
-It was good.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.619
...spine tingles and the whole nine.
It was just...

04:04.702 --> 04:06.746
-Wow, gotta have spine tingles.
-Hallelujah!

04:06.829 --> 04:09.374
You know, you deserve some fun.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.334
-Yes, you do. I mean, come on!
-Thank you.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.544
How long has it been since you kissed
anybody other than Bill?

04:13.628 --> 04:16.130
Okay, please take your foot off my mood.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.007
And frankly,
how many did she kiss before Bill?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.384
Well, that is some simple math.

04:19.467 --> 04:22.428
Are we gonna count JJ
in the second grade? Remember JJ?

04:22.929 --> 04:25.348
-I do remember JJ!
-[Dana Sue laughing] Yes! Yes!

04:25.431 --> 04:27.517
I saw JJ the other day. He's looking…

04:27.850 --> 04:30.186
Listen, you always count your first kiss,

04:30.270 --> 04:32.689
and then you just keep on kissing
till you lose count.

04:33.147 --> 04:36.359
All right. Well, enough, you two.
Some of us have got to get to work.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.277
Hmm.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.404
-Don't you love the sound of that?
-I do.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.114
Opening day, ladies.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.991
[squeal, chuckle]

04:49.956 --> 04:52.125
Hey, uh, can I talk to you for a sec?

04:52.208 --> 04:54.335
-Uh, yeah, you don't have to--
-I do. Um...

04:55.336 --> 04:57.422
It's just, you know, I mean, I was...

04:57.505 --> 05:01.884
crazy and stupid, and, um...
It didn't... It wasn't anything.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.220
I mean, of course you know that, right?

05:06.014 --> 05:07.223
Can't make my dad wait.

05:07.849 --> 05:08.975
Come on, guys.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.483
-[Bill] Bud, you all right?
-Yeah.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.070
[Bill] Well, hey, kids!

05:21.779 --> 05:23.114
How are you guys? Good?

05:23.197 --> 05:26.284
I hope you're hungry
'cause Noreen's been cooking up a storm.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.786
[Maddie] I would recommend you try
the Flow Yoga first

05:28.870 --> 05:31.539
and then see how you feel,
and then you could try the Fusion.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.541
Okay, let me know how it goes.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.543
[Trotter] You'll be fine.

05:35.626 --> 05:38.129
-Have a great day. Okay, bye.
- I will. I will. Take care. Bye.

05:38.212 --> 05:39.172
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.465
How'd your morning class go?

05:40.548 --> 05:41.549
Pretty good. Pretty good.

05:41.632 --> 05:44.177
I'm hoping I convinced a few
to sign up for one-on-one sessions.

05:44.260 --> 05:47.764
My, uh, my numbers are starting
a little below than what I expected.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.307
No, give it some time.

05:49.390 --> 05:52.602
The women of Serenity will be lining up
to get a spot on your schedule

05:52.685 --> 05:54.145
once they see the results you get.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.106
The three of you need to train with me.
Set an example?

05:57.190 --> 05:58.274
[laughs]

05:58.358 --> 05:59.984
Helen and Dana Sue are starting this week.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.321
I promise you,
I will do it as soon as I can.

06:03.738 --> 06:04.572
Thank you.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.491
Congratulations on your first day.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.242
Buddy, you are so thoughtful!

06:08.326 --> 06:09.494
Oh, yeah. Sure.

06:10.161 --> 06:13.373
He's right, you are so thoughtful.
These are beautiful, thank you.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.541
Well, in all honesty,
I was going to bring chocolates,

06:15.625 --> 06:18.294
but somebody informed me
that bringing candy to a spa

06:18.378 --> 06:19.962
might not be the best gesture.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.214
You can thank me later.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.049
[laughs]

06:23.132 --> 06:25.802
So now that it's all official,
how does it feel?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.888
Still a little scary, but mostly exciting.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.935
Trotter, would you mind
manning the desk for a minute?

06:34.018 --> 06:36.187
Sure, I have a few minutes
before my next class.

06:36.604 --> 06:37.605
How can I help?

06:39.774 --> 06:42.193
Ooh. Could you put these in water
for me, please?

06:42.276 --> 06:43.486
-Yes.
-Thank you.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.327
How many calories does kissing burn?

07:01.295 --> 07:03.965
I would like to take you out
on a proper date.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.050
Well, what did you have in mind?

07:06.592 --> 07:08.970
Well, we danced in public
and the world kept spinning,

07:09.053 --> 07:11.389
so dinner in public
shouldn't bring about the apocalypse.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.266
-[chuckles]
-Sullivan's maybe?

07:14.559 --> 07:19.063
Uh, or there are some restaurants
in Charleston that I've been dying to try.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.652
I know that jocks get a bad rap,
but I do know which fork to use.

07:24.735 --> 07:27.655
And I only wipe my mouth on my sleeve
when I'm eating ribs.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.074
No, I'm sorry, I'm just…

07:31.284 --> 07:35.455
I just... I don't know that I'm ready
for Serenity-level scrutiny just yet.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.664
Hmm.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.291
I wanna spend some time with you

07:38.374 --> 07:42.462
without, you know, people around
and intruding and...

07:43.171 --> 07:45.047
commenting and judging.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.718
I'm a wet blanket.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.011
No.

07:50.386 --> 07:51.512
No, no, no. Not at all.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.723
I think I figured out the perfect spot.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.809
Okay, now you're making me nervous.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.060
Don't be, it's gonna be great.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.812
How much advance notice
do you need for a sitter?

07:59.896 --> 08:02.565
Or should we just wait for a night
when Ty can watch the others?

08:03.274 --> 08:04.108
What?

08:04.192 --> 08:06.861
I gave Ty my word
that I would let him know

08:06.944 --> 08:09.155
if our relationship changed, so...

08:10.031 --> 08:12.783
Maybe I should just talk to him first
before we make a plan?

08:13.618 --> 08:14.452
Of course.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.204
I'll wait to hear.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.123
[clears throat]

08:19.499 --> 08:21.334
-I should get back to work.
-Yeah.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.512
-Go get ‘em, Boss Lady.
-[chuckles]

08:33.846 --> 08:36.098
[Helen] Well, I can't stop
thinking about it either.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.059
Uh, anyhow, I just--

08:38.142 --> 08:40.186
Yeah, mm-hmm. I just got to the spa.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.355
Call me back later.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.481
[chuckles] Tonight.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.484
You thinking about joining a spin class?

08:46.943 --> 08:48.277
Yoga, actually.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.655
But I was just informed
I don't qualify for membership.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.406
Uh-huh.
Well, I saw your dance moves last night.

08:52.490 --> 08:55.326
You do not need any help
in the flexibility department.

08:55.409 --> 08:58.204
The truth is,
I was hoping to run into you.

08:59.622 --> 09:00.623
I need a lawyer.

09:00.706 --> 09:04.794
Well, the dance was hot,
but it wasn't illegal, even in Serenity.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.880
Uh, I was just informed
that one of my duties as history teacher

09:07.964 --> 09:10.091
is to also sponsor the mock trial team,

09:10.174 --> 09:16.097
and since my legal experience is limited
to... MLB contracts and divorce decrees,

09:17.014 --> 09:19.684
I really need some help,
if you have the time.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.061
Of course I don't have the time, but...

09:23.938 --> 09:27.525
I have very, very fond memories
of my mock trial days at Serenity High,

09:28.484 --> 09:31.737
so I will help you as much as I can.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.823
Thank you, you are amazing.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.533
I was prepared to beg.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.453
And normally,
I'd ask to hear that, just for fun.

09:39.537 --> 09:40.705
[both chuckle]

09:41.122 --> 09:42.707
I'd best go give Maddie a hand.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.667
-I will call you!
-[Cal] Thank you.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.846
Hey! You all look stuffed.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.889
Noreen made a sundae bar, Mama!

09:58.973 --> 10:01.100
I had marshmallows
and chocolate sprinkles.

10:01.183 --> 10:03.269
[Maddie]
Well, I'm so glad you had a nice time.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.521
How was the first day at the spa?

10:05.896 --> 10:07.773
It wasn't as busy as we'd hoped,

10:07.857 --> 10:10.318
but somehow, I'm still exhausted.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.944
-Oh, yeah?
-Thanks for asking.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.529
Can we watch TV?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.323
As long as you've finished your homework.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.536
Tyler, I want to talk to you.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.371
Uh, yeah.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.290
We don't have secrets in this house.

10:24.832 --> 10:25.708
Yes, ma'am.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.545
Especially because we've seen firsthand
the damage that they can cause.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.671
I know, Mom.

10:30.755 --> 10:34.675
Which is why I want you to be
the first to know that...

10:35.635 --> 10:37.511
Coach Cal and I are going to dinner.

10:40.973 --> 10:41.807
Uh...

10:42.141 --> 10:43.184
Like on a date?

10:43.267 --> 10:44.727
Yeah, a date.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.108
You're expecting me
to be excited about this?

10:51.192 --> 10:53.402
Tyler, I'm sorry
if this makes you feel uncomfortable.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.612
Truly, I am.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.074
-I'm not asking for permission.
-Mom,

10:58.407 --> 10:59.367
I want you to be happy.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.618
Okay? But I just...

11:02.286 --> 11:04.830
Baseball is the one good thing
I have in my life right now.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.291
And that's not gonna change,
nobody wants that.

11:07.708 --> 11:08.751
Look, Tyler…

11:09.919 --> 11:10.795
[sighs]

11:12.213 --> 11:15.758
Sometimes, it's hard to predict
who you're gonna be attracted to.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.010
One day, you will understand that.

11:20.262 --> 11:21.138
Yeah, maybe.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.184
Thanks for letting me know.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.026
[phone chimes]

11:44.537 --> 11:45.705
Hey, Kyle…

11:49.792 --> 11:52.211
Coach Cal and I are going to go to dinner.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.505
You mean to tell me...

11:55.256 --> 11:56.966
I'm getting an A in his class?

11:57.049 --> 11:58.426
Well, not unless you study!

11:58.509 --> 11:59.844
Yeah, cause I never do that.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.271
[girl 1] She was fall-down drunk?

12:13.899 --> 12:15.317
[girls laughing]

12:16.318 --> 12:18.863
[girl 1]
If I were Annie, I'd be hiding out longer.

12:18.946 --> 12:21.699
[girl 2] Don't party above your level!
Know what I mean?

12:21.782 --> 12:23.492
[girls laughing]

12:27.580 --> 12:29.290
[indistinct chatter]

12:31.709 --> 12:32.835
Hey! Saved you a seat.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.503
Thanks, Simon.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.389
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:45.931 --> 12:46.932
[boy] Uh, I got a pen.

12:50.561 --> 12:51.645
What?

12:51.729 --> 12:53.939
Never thought I'd see CeCe Matney
at a mock trial.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.151
Not why she's here.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.653
All right. Thank you all
for giving up your lunch break,

12:59.737 --> 13:02.114
and welcome to the first meeting
for mock trial.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.074
Those of you who do not know,

13:04.158 --> 13:05.409
this is Miss Helen Decatur.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.870
She's a gifted attorney
and a former Bulldog.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.371
Mm. Once a Bulldog…

13:09.455 --> 13:10.623
Always a Bulldog!

13:10.706 --> 13:12.833
[barking, laughing]

13:12.917 --> 13:13.751
[Cal chuckles]

13:13.834 --> 13:17.087
Mrs. Decatur has graciously agreed
to run point for our team, so...

13:17.713 --> 13:18.964
Thank you, Coach Maddox.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.801
Um, our schedule is very, very tight,

13:21.884 --> 13:24.804
so we're gonna have to move
a little faster than I'd like.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.265
Let's start with some exercises
that will help me assess

13:28.349 --> 13:32.561
where your strengths lie
before I begin to assign roles.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.104
Um, sweetheart?

13:35.481 --> 13:38.526
We pretend we're in court, not courtin'.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.236
[class chuckles]

13:41.904 --> 13:42.863
What's your name?

13:43.656 --> 13:45.407
-CeCe.
-[Helen] CeCe.

13:45.866 --> 13:48.035
Well, CeCe, why don't you come on up here?

13:48.118 --> 13:49.745
Do I have a volunteer to join CeCe?

13:50.663 --> 13:51.664
Simon Spry.

13:54.625 --> 13:55.793
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.586
Mr. Spry, CeCe.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.383
These are debate games.
They're all about thinking on your feet.

14:02.883 --> 14:06.762
I'll give you a topic, set the timer,
and then you go. You got it?

14:08.389 --> 14:10.099
All right. First topic:

14:11.100 --> 14:13.602
Salt versus pepper. Go!

14:13.686 --> 14:16.105
Oh.
Well, salt is clearly the superior spice.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.233
You can put it on almost anything,
and it improves the flavor.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.860
Sweet, savory. You name it.

14:21.443 --> 14:22.319
Oh, please.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.572
Salt is what drowning in the ocean
tastes like.

14:24.655 --> 14:25.865
[class chuckles]

14:26.198 --> 14:27.867
Salt is one simple chemical.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.995
Pepper is much more complex
in composition and flavor.

14:31.412 --> 14:34.415
If you want to make
your already salty dish more interesting,

14:34.874 --> 14:35.958
add pepper.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.210
So your argument is the fact
that pepper is more complex,

14:38.294 --> 14:40.337
but who says complexity is a positive?

14:41.046 --> 14:44.008
Imagine scrambled eggs without salt,
cookies without salt!

14:44.592 --> 14:46.510
The flavor it adds is far from simple.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.137
Versatility makes it superior.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.974
I'm sorry, I thought we were debating
whether salt or pepper is best,

14:52.600 --> 14:54.226
not which is more versatile.

14:55.352 --> 14:58.480
And how's the fact that salt can be paired
with any dish a positive?

14:58.564 --> 15:00.149
That's the definition of basic.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.152
And as we all know,
basic cannot be the best,

15:03.235 --> 15:05.946
which... makes pepper the clear winner.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.740
-[phone ringing]
-All right.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.576
Excellent job, both of you.

15:11.493 --> 15:12.578
Excellent job.

15:12.661 --> 15:15.080
-Uh, who would like to go next?
-You did great.

15:15.789 --> 15:18.125
The topic is...

15:19.335 --> 15:21.295
-onion rings versus french fries.
-Me!

15:21.378 --> 15:22.338
[bell ringing]

15:24.340 --> 15:26.383
[CeCe]
I'm gonna make sure I see you, though.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.010
[CeCe chuckles]

15:28.594 --> 15:30.304
CeCe, do you have a minute?

15:31.096 --> 15:31.931
Yeah.

15:35.434 --> 15:39.438
I think that you have what it takes
to be our lead defense attorney.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.233
What are you talking about?
Everyone was laughing at me.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.360
Oh, no. No.

15:44.902 --> 15:49.657
They were laughing because your points
were funny, and aggressive, and smart.

15:51.533 --> 15:52.952
You're really good at this.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.170
We had the tightest game.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.713
Every time I put something
on the outside corners,

16:04.797 --> 16:05.756
it seems to be doing pretty good,

16:05.839 --> 16:07.424
so if you throw it
on the inside next time...

16:07.508 --> 16:09.551
Annie can do just fine on her own.

16:09.635 --> 16:10.636
Yo, don't even sweat it.

16:10.719 --> 16:11.762
-Just shut up!
-Calm down!

16:11.845 --> 16:14.056
Any day, Townsend.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.099
[Cal] Townsend!

16:15.975 --> 16:16.892
In my office.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.062
[boys chuckle]

16:20.145 --> 16:20.980
Just stop, man.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.232
[laughs] Have a good meeting.

16:24.733 --> 16:25.651
Coach.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.285
You gotta stop letting Jackson Lewis
get under your skin.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.787
Why don't you tell him
to stop hassling me?

16:36.870 --> 16:37.705
I will.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.957
But I need to talk to you first...

16:41.250 --> 16:42.710
because I know your mom already did.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.629
She did. So you don't have to.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.470
I can't have you
or your teammates thinking

16:53.554 --> 16:55.931
I'm gonna go easy on you
just because I'm seeing your mom.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.017
So what,
you're gonna come down on me harder?

16:58.600 --> 17:00.644
I'm gonna continue to deal with you fairly

17:01.061 --> 17:02.104
as a coach should.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.189
Yeah, a coach.

17:05.816 --> 17:06.692
Just a coach.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.614
Ty, I would never presume
to step into your father's shoes,

17:13.115 --> 17:15.200
whatever happens between me and your mom.

17:16.994 --> 17:20.414
Because I also know how tough things are
between the two of you right now.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.667
Hey, just don't burn that bridge.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.127
He lit the match, not me.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.378
I've been there, Ty.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.759
And when I finally wanted to reach out,
it was too late.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.971
What happened, he stopped talking to you?

17:37.723 --> 17:38.724
No, he died.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.438
You're probably not ready
to hear this, but...

17:45.856 --> 17:47.024
[sighs] Look, I...

17:47.107 --> 17:48.567
I wished it had happened differently.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.194
I thought this conversation
was about my mom.

17:50.277 --> 17:51.487
All right. It...

17:52.071 --> 17:54.198
I just think that
if you were a little less mad at him,

17:54.281 --> 17:55.365
you'd be a little less mad
at everyone else.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.952
No, Coach. No, I have the right
to my own feelings and my own space.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.497
Okay? And I can decide
who comes into them.

18:03.624 --> 18:04.625
So does your mom.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.966
Can you tell Jackson
I would like to see him?

18:22.059 --> 18:24.812
You ever feel
like nobody actually wants you around

18:24.895 --> 18:27.147
because of one simple, stupid mistake?

18:27.231 --> 18:28.273
You are not stupid,

18:28.357 --> 18:30.192
and everyone makes mistakes.

18:31.819 --> 18:32.736
If you ask me,

18:33.779 --> 18:35.739
Mystery Jock doesn't sound worthy of you,

18:35.823 --> 18:37.825
and Other Girl has issues.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.535
Thanks, Isaac.

18:40.702 --> 18:41.662
Appreciate that.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.413
High school's hard,

18:43.872 --> 18:45.541
especially when you have
a sensitive heart.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.793
Give yourself a break.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.587
I wasn't cool in high school,

18:50.671 --> 18:53.966
and it felt like my heart got stomped on
at least three times a week.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.425
How did you get through it?

18:55.884 --> 18:57.970
-You sure you wanna know?
-Absolutely!

18:58.428 --> 19:00.681
Well, what helped me
was hanging out with my mom.

19:00.764 --> 19:01.765
I can't tell my mom.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.809
Whoa, not at all what I was talking about.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.727
Just take a minute to look at her,

19:06.186 --> 19:07.271
connect with her,

19:08.105 --> 19:09.731
and remember that she loves you,

19:10.691 --> 19:11.733
no matter what.

19:15.904 --> 19:17.823
Okay, so break this down for me again.

19:17.906 --> 19:21.160
You were texting her mom a cover story
and she just suddenly kisses you?

19:22.035 --> 19:23.537
She was drunk, you saw her.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.206
And I shut it down. Nothing happened.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.127
Look, I mean, okay, yeah, it was awkward,
but I figured it'd just blow over

19:30.210 --> 19:31.920
and we'd laugh about it
when she sobered up.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.089
Okay, but then she sent me this message

19:34.173 --> 19:36.258
and now she's acting super strange,
almost like...

19:36.884 --> 19:37.718
like she likes me.

19:37.801 --> 19:40.345
Okay, people say stupid stuff
all the time when they're drunk.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.847
And besides, man, it's Annie.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.641
You two have been knowin' each other
since diapers. Can't be that bad.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.061
<i>You're amazing.</i>

19:49.646 --> 19:50.856
<i>And that kiss...</i>

19:54.026 --> 19:55.569
<i>Oops! But, for real, </i>

19:56.320 --> 19:58.906
<i>best kiss </i>ever!

20:00.324 --> 20:02.618
Wow, bro. She got it bad. She got--

20:02.701 --> 20:05.162
-Sounds like love! [laughs]
-Jackson, give me my phone!

20:05.245 --> 20:06.413
Hey, give me the phone.

20:06.496 --> 20:07.956
-Oh, man, you had everybody fooled...
-Calm down.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.625
...with that knight-in-shining-armor act
at the party,

20:09.708 --> 20:11.919
but it was all a plan
so you could get her alone.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.795
-That's not what happened!
-It's all good, Townsend.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.255
You like ‘em young, just like your dad.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.258
Hey! You'll get suspended, all right?
He's not worth it.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.552
[laughs] Get a sense of humor, Townsend.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.642
[phone chimes]

20:31.897 --> 20:34.858
Uh... he sent Annie's message
to the team group text.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.113
-My God!
-Hey, look. Don't worry, all right?

20:40.197 --> 20:41.865
Just lay low, it'll all blow over.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.659
All right? Come on, man.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.329
Frances gave me first pick.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.581
Seniority has its privileges,
don't you know?

20:50.123 --> 20:53.168
But I thought you might wanna take a look
at the rest for your restaurant.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.505
Ah, these are... They're fabulous.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.423
[Dana Sue laughs]

20:58.507 --> 21:00.717
Look! Fourth of July.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.678
What is this? Is this the '60s?

21:02.761 --> 21:04.012
I think so, let's see.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.181
-Oh, 1962!
-Yeah.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.016
Oh, I love it.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.643
[Dana Sue chuckles]

21:10.852 --> 21:12.938
I'm just picking up a to-go order.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.731
Chef Erik's chicken pot pie.

21:15.691 --> 21:16.817
Cravings, you know?

21:18.068 --> 21:19.486
I'm sure it'll be right out.

21:21.863 --> 21:25.450
Uh, Miss Peggy, I'm the one
that put the almonds in the first salad,

21:25.534 --> 21:27.369
and I just want to apologize.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.829
I appreciate that, Isaac.

21:28.912 --> 21:30.706
All right, just let us know
if you need anything else.

21:30.789 --> 21:34.835
Oh, get a load of this.
The Jessamine Juniors, 1997.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.546
-[Dana Sue laughs]
-[Isaac] What's the Jessamine Juniors?

21:37.629 --> 21:39.214
-An annual high school pageant.
-Yeah.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.216
Very big honor around these parts:

21:41.717 --> 21:42.968
scholarship, the whole deal.

21:43.051 --> 21:45.387
-Oh. Wow. Is that you, Chef?
-Yeah.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.097
And Miss Helen and Miss Maddie?

21:47.180 --> 21:48.140
Mm-hmm.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.225
-And Mary Vaughn!
-[Dana Sue] Oh.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.686
[Dana Sue chuckles]

21:52.769 --> 21:55.647
Uh, Miss Peggy,
shouldn't you be in this one too?

21:55.731 --> 21:57.566
Uh, my parents separated for a bit,

21:57.649 --> 22:00.319
so my mother and I lived in Memphis
that year.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.279
Guess I missed my chance.

22:03.363 --> 22:04.197
[Erik] Noreen,

22:04.573 --> 22:07.409
I slid a little spinach salad
in there too for iron.

22:08.243 --> 22:09.995
[grunts] My baby!

22:12.539 --> 22:13.540
[Peggy] You okay?

22:13.623 --> 22:15.959
Have you had pain before
during your pregnancy?

22:16.043 --> 22:17.669
Mm-mm. [exhales]

22:17.753 --> 22:20.297
-[Erik] Is the pain sharp or dull?
-Very sharp.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.884
-[Erik] Any pain in your legs or chest?
-No. [exhales]

22:24.468 --> 22:26.636
-Any-- Any nausea?
-Not at the moment.

22:27.804 --> 22:28.972
[Noreen sighs]

22:29.639 --> 22:30.849
You think you can stand up?

22:33.560 --> 22:34.686
[exhales]

22:35.520 --> 22:37.064
Inhale and hold.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.940
Try to relax your muscles.

22:39.983 --> 22:42.903
Good. Good, now exhale slowly.

22:47.699 --> 22:48.825
T-- That's better.

22:49.993 --> 22:52.537
[exhales]
Wow, that's-- that's so much better.

22:52.621 --> 22:53.705
Take another deep breath.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.874
-[exhales]
-Noreen, do you want me to call Bill?

22:55.957 --> 22:57.167
No, um...

22:57.250 --> 23:00.504
It's amazing, but the pain stopped
just as quickly as it started.

23:00.837 --> 23:03.131
I guess Peanut was trying
to make more room.

23:03.673 --> 23:07.511
Your standing up gave him more room.
That little one has some sharp elbows.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.888
Isaac, grab her a glass of water.

23:09.971 --> 23:11.223
[Noreen] I'm really okay.

23:11.640 --> 23:15.685
You don't have to make a fuss.
I just... need to catch my breath is all.

23:16.686 --> 23:17.813
Thank you, Erik.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.401
-[exhales]
-[Peggy] Sure you're okay?

23:22.484 --> 23:24.236
-[Noreen] Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-[Peggy] You're okay.

23:25.445 --> 23:26.446
[exhales]

23:28.782 --> 23:29.825
[inhales]

23:36.790 --> 23:37.874
[sighs]

23:39.209 --> 23:40.210
[groans]

23:46.883 --> 23:48.051
[Maddie] All right, ladies.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.261
[Helen] Oh, these look good.

23:49.344 --> 23:50.345
[ladies chuckle]

23:50.971 --> 23:54.808
Here is to our first official week
of business.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.310
[all] Pour it out.

23:57.394 --> 23:58.228
There we go.

23:58.311 --> 23:59.938
-[Dana Sue] Mm.
-Okay now...

24:00.021 --> 24:00.856
It is...

24:01.398 --> 24:02.607
It's real now,

24:03.150 --> 24:05.652
and I was not prepared
for how scary it would be.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.195
You'll get used to it.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.530
I doubt that!

24:09.281 --> 24:10.949
We started a lot slower than we'd hoped.

24:11.032 --> 24:13.034
Trotter had a class today
with three people in it.

24:13.118 --> 24:16.496
Yeah, well, we're not even a full week in.
We got to give it time.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.666
Well, that's true, but I don't know.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.252
I don't know how long we're gonna be able
to sustain this workload.

24:22.335 --> 24:23.545
At this point, we won't be able

24:23.628 --> 24:26.047
to bring on the additional help
as quickly as we planned.

24:26.131 --> 24:26.965
[sighs]

24:27.048 --> 24:29.801
You know, I know how exhausted
and over-extended we all are,

24:29.885 --> 24:33.430
but, uh... if this is how it's gonna be,
we're gonna figure out a way.

24:33.889 --> 24:37.267
What were you thinking saying yes
to helping Cal with the mock trial

24:37.350 --> 24:39.144
-with everything else going on?
-Miss Thang,

24:39.686 --> 24:42.063
I would think that you
of all people would appreciate

24:42.147 --> 24:44.774
how hard it is to say no to Cal Maddox.

24:44.858 --> 24:45.692
Yes, it is.

24:45.775 --> 24:47.152
Good Lord with you two.

24:47.235 --> 24:48.236
[Helen laughs]

24:50.071 --> 24:51.823
He's taking me on a proper date.

24:51.907 --> 24:55.118
Wha-- What? Where you going?

24:55.202 --> 24:56.703
I don't know. I don't know.

24:56.786 --> 25:00.624
I mean, I told him I didn't want
to go anywhere with tongues wagging,

25:00.707 --> 25:03.210
so he said he would take care of it.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.004
-I don't know what to expect.
-[Dana Sue] Wow.

25:06.463 --> 25:09.090
A man who plans things all on his own?

25:09.174 --> 25:12.177
You have truly found yourself a unicorn.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.429
-I don't know what I found.
-A unicorn with a six-pack.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.598
[all laugh]

25:16.681 --> 25:18.308
I will drink to that.

25:20.602 --> 25:21.853
[phone vibrating]

25:37.786 --> 25:40.121
Tyler Townsend is dead.

25:47.754 --> 25:49.339
[phone vibrating]

25:52.592 --> 25:55.595
[Helen, Dana Sue, Maddie
chatter indistinctly]

26:00.475 --> 26:01.768
What happened with you and Annie?

26:01.851 --> 26:03.311
Stay out of it. You don't know
what you're talking about.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.813
-I'm gonna make sure she's okay.
-No!

26:04.896 --> 26:06.147
This is between her and me.

26:17.951 --> 26:18.910
How could you?

26:19.369 --> 26:22.872
I didn't. Jackson heard at practice
and stole my phone--

26:22.956 --> 26:24.499
You played it at practice?

26:24.583 --> 26:27.335
No! No, well, just for Gabe.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.588
Look,
I thought we were the only ones there.

26:30.463 --> 26:32.340
He's my best friend.
I had to talk to someone.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.593
Really? You needed to talk about it?

26:35.510 --> 26:37.887
That's funny,
because you've avoided talking to me

26:37.971 --> 26:39.222
every chance that you get.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.309
Everybody knows!

26:42.726 --> 26:44.978
It was bad enough
that some people knew I got drunk,

26:45.061 --> 26:47.522
but how am I supposed
to show my face at school

26:47.606 --> 26:50.483
now that everyone's heard me
blathering like an idiot?

26:50.567 --> 26:51.901
I'm sorry, Annie.

26:51.985 --> 26:55.363
Get out! I don't wanna see you,
and I don't wanna talk to you.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.657
Look, I didn't mean for this to happen!

26:57.741 --> 26:59.618
Then you should've deleted
the stupid message!

26:59.701 --> 27:02.537
Okay, fine! Fine, I screwed up.

27:02.954 --> 27:05.415
-Okay, I wasn't thinking!
-And just so we're clear,

27:05.498 --> 27:07.334
I wasn't thinking when I kissed you.

27:07.834 --> 27:08.835
I was drunk.

27:08.918 --> 27:09.919
It meant nothing.

27:12.505 --> 27:15.133
Now, leave. [sobs] Go!

27:22.724 --> 27:24.142
[sobbing]

27:53.630 --> 27:55.048
Shouldn't you be in school?

27:55.131 --> 27:57.884
Oh, well, they let me out for lunch…
twice a semester.

27:57.967 --> 27:58.927
[chuckles]

28:06.059 --> 28:08.520
Okay,
now I can go on with the rest of my day.

28:08.603 --> 28:09.771
[Maddie chuckles]

28:10.188 --> 28:13.191
I was actually running an errand,
but this was a nice bonus.

28:13.775 --> 28:16.528
Are you finally gonna tell me
where you're taking me tomorrow night?

28:16.611 --> 28:17.779
Where's the fun in that?

28:17.862 --> 28:19.322
So I know what to wear.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.283
Just be comfortable.

28:22.742 --> 28:24.411
-That's such a man answer.
-[chuckles]

28:25.286 --> 28:28.998
I promise there won't be any interruptions
or judging eyes.

28:29.624 --> 28:32.043
I will have you all to myself.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.169
[Maddie chuckles]

28:39.884 --> 28:42.595
Mm. Mm-hmm. I gotta go.
You're gonna make me late for class.

28:42.679 --> 28:43.596
[chuckles]

28:45.557 --> 28:46.516
Bye.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.476
[exhales]

28:50.729 --> 28:53.106
[CeCe] I heard about Annie's message
making the rounds.

28:53.189 --> 28:54.566
That sucks.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.026
Yeah, sure does.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.362
I just thought everybody knew

28:59.446 --> 29:02.615
you and Annie were more like siblings
than anything else.

29:03.616 --> 29:05.577
Yeah, you might be the only one
who gets it.

29:06.369 --> 29:09.038
[chuckles] No. No.
Adolescents need their drama.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.749
This whole town needs its drama,

29:12.041 --> 29:13.209
and I'm so over it.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.963
You know, when I have those days,

29:17.046 --> 29:19.257
the only thing that helps
is to see a movie.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.260
Closest thing to actually leaving town.

29:22.343 --> 29:23.303
[Tyler] Hm.

29:24.471 --> 29:27.390
There's a new horror flick playing
at the multiplex in Castlewood.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.269
That's not a bad idea.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.104
-Let's do it.
-Cool.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.274
-You-- You bought them.
-[Erik] I did not.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.318
Did you make them or did you buy them?

29:38.860 --> 29:40.153
Well, uh, hello!

29:40.236 --> 29:42.197
When did you join
the Kitchen Entrance Club?

29:42.280 --> 29:44.199
Uh, sorry, I'm actually here for--

29:44.282 --> 29:46.409
Hey, Cal. Be right back.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.870
-What?
-Nice to see you though.

29:48.953 --> 29:49.954
Uh-huh.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.799
What on earth
would those two have to talk about?

30:01.466 --> 30:04.344
Uh, either baseball or pastry
would be my guess.

30:05.553 --> 30:07.222
Baseball pastries maybe?

30:07.305 --> 30:08.431
All right. Stop.

30:08.848 --> 30:11.351
[indistinct chatter]

30:19.067 --> 30:20.527
[door handle rattles]

30:20.610 --> 30:21.778
[door opens]

30:25.114 --> 30:25.949
Hey.

30:26.658 --> 30:27.951
What are you still doing up?

30:28.034 --> 30:29.744
I just wanted to wait and say goodnight.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.162
Oh. All right.

30:32.288 --> 30:34.582
[chuckles] Aw.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.708
I love you.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.586
And I love you, sweet girl.

30:39.295 --> 30:40.421
[chuckles]

30:54.185 --> 30:55.812
Dude, what?

30:56.813 --> 30:57.689
Why?

30:57.772 --> 30:59.732
[exhales] We were just hanging out.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.068
Stop. I know you're not into her.

31:02.151 --> 31:03.069
She's all right.

31:04.529 --> 31:08.283
And besides, dating her might clarify
the whole Annie situation for everyone.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.785
Oh, yeah, smart move.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.328
Totally gonna end well.

31:12.662 --> 31:14.289
[bell ringing]

31:14.372 --> 31:16.082
[indistinct chatter]

31:21.963 --> 31:23.172
Hey, Erik!

31:23.923 --> 31:24.841
Good to see you.

31:25.842 --> 31:28.469
Can I, uh...
Can I help you with something?

31:30.138 --> 31:31.639
No. I-- I, uh...

31:33.266 --> 31:34.309
Um...

31:36.227 --> 31:39.147
You have to be a vet
to participate in this group?

31:40.565 --> 31:42.692
No. No, all are welcome.

31:43.943 --> 31:44.944
Come on in.

31:45.612 --> 31:46.529
Join us.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.554
-[Simon] Hey.
-Hey.

32:16.059 --> 32:19.020
[sighs] So glad Miss Decatur only wanted
to meet with the defense team today.

32:19.103 --> 32:21.439
-I really needed a break.
-You and me both. [sighs]

32:21.522 --> 32:22.440
[Simon chuckles]

32:23.983 --> 32:26.402
So I guess it's time
we have the awkward conversation

32:26.486 --> 32:28.363
about who covers mock trial for the paper?

32:28.446 --> 32:30.865
Well, we both do have an undeniable bias.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.075
True.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.494
I guess there's only one fair way
to resolve this.

32:34.577 --> 32:35.536
Agreed.

32:37.622 --> 32:38.623
Rock, paper, scissors.

32:38.706 --> 32:39.582
[both laugh]

32:40.750 --> 32:42.585
Or, and this is a radical thought,

32:43.211 --> 32:45.880
I could cover the photos
and you can take the byline?

32:47.340 --> 32:48.174
Yeah.

32:48.716 --> 32:49.634
Okay.

32:50.343 --> 32:51.427
[chuckles]

32:54.138 --> 32:55.139
[Helen] Hey, CeCe.

32:56.516 --> 32:57.517
Where are you going?

32:58.017 --> 33:00.895
I'm passing on mock trial. No time.

33:02.230 --> 33:05.066
CeCe, you're walking away
from a real opportunity here.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.903
And a chance to show everyone
that there's more to you than boys,

33:08.987 --> 33:11.322
and clothes, and snark.

33:33.261 --> 33:34.262
[Maddie] Thank you.

33:36.556 --> 33:39.183
Okay, I don't understand.
I thought we were going out to dinner.

33:39.851 --> 33:40.685
We are.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.187
Trust me.

33:51.320 --> 33:54.407
How did you set this up
right under my nose?

33:54.490 --> 33:56.534
Oh, I'll never reveal my secrets.

33:56.617 --> 33:57.618
[Maddie laughs]

33:58.036 --> 34:00.621
I was here not three hours ago.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.291
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

34:06.377 --> 34:07.378
[cork pops]

34:08.629 --> 34:11.466
You are a clever man, Cal Maddox.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.056
To an evening without interruptions.

34:18.139 --> 34:21.350
-Oh. Okay. That sounds nice.
-[glasses clang]

34:23.478 --> 34:25.730
[Bill]
Well, that was delicious, sweetheart.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.857
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.693
Ladybug, did you get enough here?
Yep? Okay.

34:31.152 --> 34:33.154
-How about you, big guy? You good?
-Oh, yeah. Thanks.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.363
[Bill] All right.

34:34.447 --> 34:35.823
-Thanks.
-[Bill] You bet.

34:38.659 --> 34:40.745
Can I have another sundae bar for dessert?

34:40.828 --> 34:42.580
I hadn't planned on it, sweetie,

34:42.663 --> 34:45.374
but I do have some ice cream
left over from last time.

34:45.458 --> 34:46.667
First, though,

34:46.751 --> 34:48.294
there's something real important

34:48.377 --> 34:50.922
that Noreen and I would like
to talk to y'all about.

34:52.048 --> 34:54.175
We are building a new family here,

34:54.550 --> 34:56.552
and you are an important part of it,

34:57.595 --> 35:00.598
so we want you to be a part
of the wedding.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.601
Katie, we'd love for you to be
our flower girl.

35:03.684 --> 35:06.229
Can I wear my favorite boots
and a new poofy dress?

35:06.854 --> 35:07.897
Yes, of course.

35:08.314 --> 35:11.943
And, Kyle, I was hoping
you'd grace us with a song?

35:12.026 --> 35:13.194
What do you say, bud? Huh?

35:14.320 --> 35:15.988
And, uh, Tyler,

35:16.572 --> 35:18.324
I can't think of anyone

35:18.407 --> 35:21.285
that I'd rather have stand up for me,
so, uh...

35:22.328 --> 35:23.871
I'd love you to be my best man.

35:28.751 --> 35:30.294
Kyle, Katie, come on.
Time for us to go home.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.004
But I want ice cream!

35:32.088 --> 35:33.297
Of course you do, honey.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.802
-Come on, we'll get some at the house.
-Hey, Tyler,

35:37.885 --> 35:38.970
-hang on a minute now.
-No.

35:43.641 --> 35:46.477
Well, this is delicious.
Erik outdid himself.

35:47.603 --> 35:49.147
Well, wait till you see dessert.

35:49.772 --> 35:51.315
Wait, did I miss that?

35:51.399 --> 35:52.775
[phone vibrating]

35:55.194 --> 35:56.821
It's set up by the hot tub.

35:57.613 --> 35:58.531
Oh, is it?

35:58.614 --> 35:59.574
[both chuckle]

36:00.324 --> 36:01.826
[phone vibrating]

36:04.453 --> 36:06.205
-Maddie...
-[phone vibrating]

36:07.206 --> 36:08.499
...you have three kids.

36:09.000 --> 36:09.917
Answer.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.419
[phone vibrating]

36:13.754 --> 36:14.630
I'm sorry.

36:14.964 --> 36:15.965
[phone beeps]

36:21.512 --> 36:23.556
-Is everyone okay?
-Yeah.

36:24.265 --> 36:25.308
[phone beeps]

36:26.893 --> 36:29.562
Bill and Noreen asked the kids
to be in their wedding.

36:30.104 --> 36:31.147
[chuckles]

36:32.023 --> 36:34.025
Well, I'm gonna guess
that didn't go over too well.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.278
I don't even know how to respond to them.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.491
I wanna make your life better...

36:43.951 --> 36:45.369
not more complicated.

36:47.288 --> 36:48.122
Let me take you home.

36:55.838 --> 36:57.215
Thank you for tonight.

37:04.096 --> 37:05.181
I got it from here.

37:06.641 --> 37:07.725
If you're sure.

37:09.143 --> 37:10.019
Yeah.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.899
-Good night.
-Good night. Thank you again.

37:37.713 --> 37:38.923
Well, you look nice.

37:39.006 --> 37:40.508
Thanks for bringing the kids home.

37:40.967 --> 37:43.302
Not that they wanted to be
in the car with me.

37:46.639 --> 37:50.226
I'm guessing you heard we invited them
to be in the wedding.

37:51.769 --> 37:53.187
You should've talked to me first.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.314
We had a deal.

37:55.815 --> 37:57.358
You wanna co-parent?

37:57.441 --> 37:58.943
This is not that.

37:59.026 --> 37:59.860
Still,

37:59.944 --> 38:02.989
no reason for them to cause a scene
the way that they did.

38:03.072 --> 38:03.990
[scoffs]

38:05.408 --> 38:07.034
I swear to God, Bill,

38:07.118 --> 38:09.745
sometimes you don't have the sense
God gave a goose.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.247
You ambushed them.

38:12.498 --> 38:14.208
We don't even have divorce papers yet.

38:18.671 --> 38:19.588
You're right.

38:25.344 --> 38:26.304
You're right.

38:27.179 --> 38:28.055
Okay?

38:29.724 --> 38:32.184
I should have talked to you first.

38:36.105 --> 38:36.939
It's just...

38:38.899 --> 38:42.611
I'm trying to have a relationship
with our kids,

38:42.695 --> 38:43.779
okay, and...

38:45.156 --> 38:48.159
And I thought that including them
in the wedding would help that.

38:49.368 --> 38:51.829
I can't quite see how you got there.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.088
[door opens]

39:03.841 --> 39:04.842
[door closes]

39:13.142 --> 39:14.185
You okay?

39:14.727 --> 39:15.644
No.

39:16.395 --> 39:17.313
[inhales]

39:17.855 --> 39:19.023
And don't ask me to be.

39:20.066 --> 39:21.067
Of course not.

39:25.321 --> 39:28.574
Tyler, you have every right
to be angry at your father.

39:31.952 --> 39:33.913
But he and Noreen are getting married.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.165
You're gonna be a big brother again.

39:38.459 --> 39:39.335
I know.

39:41.295 --> 39:42.546
[shaky breath]

39:43.422 --> 39:45.925
Tyler, you need to take a serious look
at the kind of relationship

39:46.008 --> 39:48.135
that you want with your father
in the future.

39:51.764 --> 39:54.141
Don't refuse to be in the wedding
on my account.

39:56.852 --> 39:58.062
You can say no.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.981
But you can also say yes.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.154
You have my support whatever you decide.

40:12.576 --> 40:13.661
[sobs]

40:16.831 --> 40:18.416
Oh, my sweet boy.

40:22.711 --> 40:23.629
[sniffs]

40:28.592 --> 40:29.844
I love you.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.262
I love you too.

40:35.641 --> 40:37.268
Katie and Kyle were excited.

40:39.353 --> 40:41.105
Why did Ty have to spoil it?

40:41.856 --> 40:43.858
That wasn't his intent, sweetheart.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.696
So what was his intent?

40:49.989 --> 40:50.906
I don't know.

40:52.366 --> 40:53.617
I didn't ask him.

40:55.995 --> 40:57.872
You should have.
He owes you an explanation.

40:57.955 --> 40:58.789
You're his father.

40:58.873 --> 40:59.915
Tyler...

41:00.916 --> 41:02.585
doesn't owe me anything.

41:05.921 --> 41:06.922
Hey.

41:08.090 --> 41:09.133
Hey.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.135
Listen to me now.

41:13.262 --> 41:17.975
I want this wedding to be everything
you've imagined, all right? I do.

41:19.602 --> 41:22.521
But I can't force my kids
to want that too.

41:25.816 --> 41:27.818
At least this kid and I
know where we stand.

41:29.820 --> 41:30.738
Hey.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.542
[Erik] You on barista duty now too?

41:43.626 --> 41:44.585
[Helen chuckles]

41:45.252 --> 41:48.589
I take my commitment to the spa
and to coffee seriously.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.090
[laughs]

41:50.633 --> 41:55.095
Uh, I did hear about that, uh, dinner
you made for Maddie and Cal.

41:56.096 --> 41:58.516
I didn't know
that you were such a romantic.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.476
Well, I guess I'm full
of surprises myself.

42:00.559 --> 42:01.852
-[phone chimes]
-[laughs]

42:06.774 --> 42:08.984
I do love a man with spontaneity.

42:09.068 --> 42:12.071
[Erik laughs]
Now, that doesn't surprise me at all.

42:12.154 --> 42:13.197
[Helen] Mm-hmm.

42:15.699 --> 42:16.534
[Helen chuckles]

42:18.911 --> 42:19.954
[chuckles]

42:20.913 --> 42:22.790
[laughs]

42:30.130 --> 42:31.799
Oh, goodness.

42:35.219 --> 42:36.220
Lemon pistachio?

42:36.637 --> 42:37.596
I'm...

42:40.933 --> 42:42.101
Well, thank you.

42:43.143 --> 42:44.395
[chuckles]

42:51.819 --> 42:53.737
[indistinct chatter]

43:04.582 --> 43:06.292
For those of you playing along,

43:06.375 --> 43:09.253
it's 150, and I ate two hours ago.

43:12.840 --> 43:15.551
Is that an okay number,
or does it sound a little high?

43:17.219 --> 43:19.054
Why would you think
I'd know the answer to that?

43:19.138 --> 43:20.723
Well, cause you were an EMT--

43:22.516 --> 43:24.351
Come on. We need to have a talk.

43:29.815 --> 43:31.567
Why the hell are you digging around
in my past?

43:31.650 --> 43:33.777
I'm not! I just assumed
'cause of the way you handled it

43:33.861 --> 43:35.654
when Chef collapsed,
and Noreen with the baby--

43:35.738 --> 43:38.699
No. No. I've been watching you.

43:39.366 --> 43:42.119
You're always in everyone's business,
asking too many questions.

43:42.202 --> 43:43.871
Fine! Fine! I overheard Chef mention it.

43:43.954 --> 43:45.331
That never happened.

43:45.873 --> 43:48.083
Chef doesn't know. No one knows.

43:48.876 --> 43:51.170
Now, this is the last time
I'm asking nicely.

43:51.253 --> 43:54.131
Who are you,
and why are you interested in my past?

43:54.214 --> 43:55.841
Leave it alone, all right?
I didn't mean any harm!

43:55.924 --> 43:57.926
Isaac, I want the truth!

43:59.219 --> 44:02.056
I'm looking for my father,
and I thought it could be you!

44:05.100 --> 44:08.354
I was adopted, I'm trying
to find my birth parents. I thought...

44:11.148 --> 44:12.232
Um... [exhales]

44:14.401 --> 44:15.569
You got the wrong guy.

44:18.530 --> 44:19.698
I don't have children.

44:27.206 --> 44:28.123
[inhales]

44:40.386 --> 44:42.388
[instrumental music playing]
