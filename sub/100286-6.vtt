01:11.654 --> 01:12.781
Awesome, thank you.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.950
That was an appropriate amount
of applause for a woman. [laughs]

01:16.076 --> 01:17.368
[audience whoos]

01:17.535 --> 01:21.664
Yeah, it was about 60% less. That's cool.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.124
[laughter]

01:24.334 --> 01:27.337
I know it is...
It's not great to be white right now.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.258
We are being watched very closely.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.637
Like a black guy in a CVS.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.347
[oohs and laughter]

01:38.389 --> 01:39.265
I know.

01:40.517 --> 01:43.645
I know. It sucks to be white right now,
especially if you're a white dude, though,

01:43.728 --> 01:46.314
-because everyone just fucking hates you.
-[laughing]

01:46.731 --> 01:49.734
I think you'll come back around
but right now it's brutal

01:49.818 --> 01:51.986
'cause everybody... [laughs]
hates white guys,

01:52.070 --> 01:55.198
except for when you get one
on the phone for customer service.

01:55.323 --> 01:57.450
-[laughter and applause]
-[Adrienne laughs]

01:59.452 --> 02:00.703
Thank God. [chuckles]

02:01.830 --> 02:03.206
You saved me.

02:04.249 --> 02:07.127
Even Indian people are like,
"That was a close." [laughs]

02:07.210 --> 02:08.795
[audience laughs]

02:10.505 --> 02:13.216
I had a flat tire, I was changing it
and this guy goes,

02:13.299 --> 02:15.969
"I'd help you,
but you seem like a real feminist."

02:16.177 --> 02:17.303
[laughing]

02:17.679 --> 02:20.306
I know, I was just like, "I am not."

02:20.431 --> 02:21.766
[laughter]

02:22.142 --> 02:25.520
I was like, "I don't even think
women should be allowed to drive.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.232
Now change my tire."

02:31.276 --> 02:32.402
I know. [laughs]

02:32.694 --> 02:33.987
People ask me, "Are you worried

02:34.070 --> 02:36.197
they're going to start taking
women's rights away?"

02:36.281 --> 02:39.450
I'm like, "I don't know man. If they do,
though, I hope they start with blogging."

02:39.742 --> 02:41.744
[audience laughs]

02:42.704 --> 02:46.207
Look, I know we all have a voice
but not everybody needs to be heard.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.042
[continued laughter]

02:48.543 --> 02:51.796
I don't know, also if you have a recipe
for potato salad and it has raisins in it,

02:51.880 --> 02:54.924
like we're probably not going
to line up politically.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.218
[applause and laughter]

02:57.510 --> 02:58.344
I know.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.638
I am a feminist
but I'm a lazy feminist, you know?

03:00.722 --> 03:01.764
Like, I want equal rights,

03:01.848 --> 03:04.350
but I'm not going to do anything
to get that.

03:04.475 --> 03:05.560
[audience laughs]

03:05.810 --> 03:08.146
I don't even know
what all the rights are. [scoffs]

03:09.522 --> 03:12.400
-Just want whatever I'm being denied.
-[laughing]

03:13.526 --> 03:15.570
I know, there's a lot
of radical feminists, though,

03:15.653 --> 03:16.905
they're like, "Fuck all men."

03:16.988 --> 03:19.324
You're like,
"Fuck all men? We can't do that." [laughs]

03:19.532 --> 03:20.783
[audience laughs]

03:20.909 --> 03:23.536
[sighs] But what they really mean is,
like, "We don't need a man."

03:23.620 --> 03:26.581
I'm like, "Well, who's going to take
your air conditioner out?"

03:26.831 --> 03:27.874
[laughter]

03:28.082 --> 03:30.376
"You gonna take your air conditioner out,
Sarah?"

03:30.627 --> 03:32.712
"No, then we can't fuck all men." [laughs]

03:32.795 --> 03:33.796
[audience laughs]

03:33.922 --> 03:37.091
Let's just keep it
on a case-by-case basis.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.427
Like we've been doing.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.553
[laughter]

03:41.429 --> 03:44.891
It is a weird climate right now, you know?
Men don't know if they can help women,

03:44.974 --> 03:47.435
women don't know if they can
accept help from men.

03:47.518 --> 03:49.229
There have been a lot of rapes.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.897
[laughing]

03:51.439 --> 03:53.608
Just a butt-load of rapes.

03:54.817 --> 03:58.488
I do feel like all those rapes kind of put
that cat-calling video into perspective.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.240
Remember when people were really upset?

04:00.323 --> 04:02.450
They were like,
"Men are whistling at women."

04:03.034 --> 04:06.371
Now a couple years later, we're like,
"Maybe that wasn't that bad."

04:06.579 --> 04:08.581
[uproarious laughter]

04:08.748 --> 04:10.124
[applause]

04:10.375 --> 04:13.586
Maybe a construction guy
calling you pretty isn't the worst.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.963
[audience laughs]

04:15.255 --> 04:17.632
I don't know, I do support
the Me Too movement.

04:17.715 --> 04:18.549
[man whoos]

04:18.633 --> 04:21.052
Yeah, you gotta support
the Me Too movement.

04:21.135 --> 04:23.012
-[laughter]
-My only problem with it though,

04:23.096 --> 04:26.516
is that we're just lumping all of men's
shitty behavior into one category.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.269
You know? Like, even murder
has separate categories.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.564
There's like murder-murder
and then like oopsie-murder...

04:33.648 --> 04:35.608
[audience laughs]

04:35.692 --> 04:36.693
[Adrienne chuckles]

04:36.943 --> 04:39.112
where you kill somebody, but you're sorry.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.488
[laughing]

04:40.822 --> 04:43.116
So they let you get away with it...
[chuckles]

04:43.449 --> 04:44.492
'cause you're white.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.536
[oohs and laughter]

04:47.120 --> 04:49.998
I don't know, guys,
basically what I'm trying to say is,

04:50.748 --> 04:52.583
not everybody is Cosby.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.752
[audience laughs]

04:55.920 --> 04:58.881
I know, there's a big difference
between Cosby and Al Franken

04:58.965 --> 05:00.967
and they should be punished differently.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.302
[man oohs]

05:03.136 --> 05:05.972
Look, if you drug woman
and have sex with them, that is rape-rape,

05:06.055 --> 05:08.766
but if you just, like,
touch a boob in the park...

05:10.059 --> 05:13.229
I don't know, man,
maybe you just can't use Uber anymore.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.439
[laughter]

05:15.231 --> 05:17.150
Especially not UberPool. [laughs]

05:17.275 --> 05:19.277
[audience laughs]

05:19.819 --> 05:21.154
So many sexual allegations,

05:21.237 --> 05:24.115
I just started reading them the same way
I read a credit card statement.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.492
Where I'm like,
"I hope this isn't that bad.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.744
[laughter]

05:27.994 --> 05:30.079
Hope he just called her sweet tits."

05:30.288 --> 05:31.497
[continued laughter]

05:31.831 --> 05:34.459
I know, Morgan Freeman,
that's one of the new ones.

05:35.126 --> 05:39.088
I know, I was like, "I got to be honest,
I'm not going to stop watching <i>Shawshank."</i>

05:39.297 --> 05:40.673
[audience laughs]

05:41.215 --> 05:43.092
He's already in prison in the movie.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.386
[uproarious laughter]

05:46.471 --> 05:50.016
[clicks tongue] I will just pretend
he's in there for sexual assault.

05:51.309 --> 05:54.395
I know. Morgan Freeman's been
my favorite actor since I was a kid,

05:54.479 --> 05:56.356
like, if I found out
he assaulted my own mother,

05:56.439 --> 05:59.734
I'd be like, "Look, I'm going to need
to hear both sides first."

05:59.942 --> 06:01.569
[laughing]

06:01.778 --> 06:04.530
I know. My mom does think
everybody wants to rape her.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.409
I was like, "Where are you getting
this confidence from?

06:08.576 --> 06:10.578
[audience laughs]

06:14.248 --> 06:16.459
Like, your own husband
stopped fucking you."

06:17.168 --> 06:19.128
[oohs and laughter]

06:19.629 --> 06:22.840
As a woman, I'm glad I'm alive now,
you know, not like back in the day.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.051
I also just think I would've set women
further back,

06:25.134 --> 06:27.053
just 'cause it's so hard to offend me.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.639
If I was working in an office in the '60s,

06:29.722 --> 06:32.934
and some woman was like, "You know what?
These men can't just call us skirts."

06:33.017 --> 06:35.728
I think I'd have been like,
"I don't know, we're wearing skirts."

06:35.812 --> 06:37.855
[audience laughs]

06:38.648 --> 06:41.317
I'd have been like,
"I don't think it's that big of a deal.

06:41.692 --> 06:44.821
Personally, I'm just trying
to get hit less at home." [laughs]

06:44.904 --> 06:46.072
[laughter]

06:46.197 --> 06:47.365
Oh, man.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.159
-[whoos and applause]
-[Adrienne exhales]

06:50.660 --> 06:53.413
"Being called 'skirt'
is the least of my problems.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.207
I got to work on that casserole." [laughs]

06:56.374 --> 06:58.376
[audience laughs]

06:58.668 --> 07:00.211
I know. That's okay.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.422
Some of you guys
got offended by that joke. [laughs]

07:02.547 --> 07:03.631
[continued laughter]

07:03.798 --> 07:05.967
People forget though,
it used to be socially acceptable

07:06.050 --> 07:08.177
to just hit your wife back in the day.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.471
People forget that but it's like,
why do you think

07:10.555 --> 07:14.016
there were so many great
boxers in the '60s and '70s?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.143
-[oohs]
-[woman cackles]

07:15.226 --> 07:17.854
Just getting in all those extra reps.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.148
[Adrienne chuckles]

07:21.816 --> 07:24.068
I know. I'd be bad
for the women's movement, though.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.196
Just because I used to have a day job
where I'd let my boss sexually harass me,

07:27.280 --> 07:29.323
just 'cause it made the day go by quicker.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.283
[laughter]

07:30.450 --> 07:32.827
I know. [sighs] Everyone would get so mad
at me, they're like,

07:32.910 --> 07:34.745
"Why are you letting him talk
to you like that?"

07:34.829 --> 07:37.081
I'm like, "While he's telling me
how nice my rack is,

07:37.165 --> 07:39.167
you're doing a PowerPoint presentation."

07:39.292 --> 07:40.251
[continued laughter]

07:40.918 --> 07:42.545
Who's the real feminist?

07:43.546 --> 07:45.006
[applause]

07:45.465 --> 07:47.675
Work smarter, not harder.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.135
[laughing]

07:49.719 --> 07:51.596
I don't know.
It's not bad being a woman, though,

07:51.679 --> 07:54.140
they're going to start taking the taxes
off tampons, you know,

07:54.223 --> 07:56.726
'cause that's the reason
why I don't have a house. [laughs]

07:56.809 --> 07:58.811
[audience laughs]

07:58.978 --> 08:00.021
[woman whoos]

08:00.354 --> 08:02.773
Paying that hefty tampon tax.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.360
Figure if I take
those three dollars a year...

08:08.446 --> 08:09.989
and invest...

08:11.616 --> 08:15.203
in about 10 years,
I'll be able to buy two boxes of tampons.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.288
[laughter and cheering]

08:18.789 --> 08:21.167
I have a friend that's super excited
about it, she was like,

08:21.250 --> 08:24.253
"If they weren't gonna take the taxes off,
I was going to stop wearing them."

08:24.337 --> 08:27.048
She goes, I know, she was like,
"What were you going to do?"

08:27.131 --> 08:28.758
I was like, "Stop being your friend."

08:28.925 --> 08:30.134
[audience laughs]

08:31.552 --> 08:33.888
'Cause her reasoning is just so crazy.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.933
She was like, "I feel like those products
are a part of a male agenda."

08:37.016 --> 08:39.602
I was like, "I don't know if that's true.
When they were first made

08:39.685 --> 08:41.062
it was the early 1900s,

08:41.145 --> 08:43.272
there were not a lot of women
in the workforce.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.732
I don't think it was a male agenda,

08:44.815 --> 08:48.611
I just think some dude got tired
of buying a new couch every six months."

08:48.778 --> 08:50.821
-[uproarious laughter]
-[Adrienne chuckles]

08:51.072 --> 08:52.657
Like... [exhales deeply]

08:52.949 --> 08:56.077
You can only turn those cushions over...

08:56.202 --> 08:57.453
-[laughter]
-[woman whoos]

08:57.662 --> 08:58.955
so many times...

09:00.039 --> 09:02.750
before you have to throw
the whole couch away.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.877
I mean, if you think about it,

09:04.961 --> 09:08.256
that's the reason why your grandparents
had plastic on their couches.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.716
-[oohs and laughter]
-[Adrienne laughs, hums]

09:10.883 --> 09:12.385
[whoos and applause]

09:14.720 --> 09:18.641
I don't know. I'm not a good feminist,
I'm still listening to R. Kelly.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.018
-[audience laughs]
-[woman] Yeah!

09:21.352 --> 09:24.855
Kind of forgot how good that music was
until the documentary came out.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.065
[laughter]

09:27.066 --> 09:30.069
People are freaking out, they're like,
"What are we going to do to his music?"

09:30.152 --> 09:33.614
I'm like, "Look obviously I'm not going
to support anything new that he puts out.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.367
Unless it's great."

09:36.534 --> 09:38.536
-[laughter]
-[Adrienne chuckles]

09:39.370 --> 09:42.707
Honestly, though, all of his old music,
that's all grandfathered in.

09:42.873 --> 09:44.333
[continued laughter]

09:45.167 --> 09:47.211
Look, if you're not listening
to that music,

09:47.295 --> 09:49.589
it's like he fucked those kids
for nothing.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.882
[oohs and laughing]

09:53.843 --> 09:55.720
Hey guys, look, you... [laughs]

09:55.886 --> 09:57.888
[continued laughing]

09:58.347 --> 10:01.892
You may not support the war,
but you always support the soldiers.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.728
-[Adrienne laughs]
-[audience cheers]

10:04.103 --> 10:05.104
Oh, man.

10:05.187 --> 10:06.272
[applause]

10:07.940 --> 10:09.859
Those girls served this country.

10:11.193 --> 10:14.238
Yeah, I think they should have
the same rights as veterans.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.283
Should be able to go to school for free,

10:17.366 --> 10:18.576
board the plane first...

10:19.910 --> 10:22.997
Why are we letting your grandmothers
board the plane first?

10:23.539 --> 10:24.999
They've done nothing for us.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.878
Those girls are the reason
why we have the remix to "Ignition."

10:29.003 --> 10:30.504
-[uproarious laughter]
-[woman whoos]

10:31.380 --> 10:32.882
[cackling]

10:34.425 --> 10:37.428
Oh man,
did you watch the documentary, though?

10:38.220 --> 10:41.182
I didn't know he was having sex with kids
and then keeping them in his house.

10:41.265 --> 10:44.352
You're like, "Kelly, catch and release!"
[laughs]

10:44.560 --> 10:45.645
[laughter]

10:46.020 --> 10:49.190
You can't have the whole
JV basketball team in your basement.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.152
They're like,
"We're losing a lot of games.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.905
Where are the point guards?"

10:56.656 --> 10:58.866
I don't know.
I think he was just having sex with kids

10:58.949 --> 11:00.951
'cause they were
at the same reading level.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.120
[audience laughs]

11:05.706 --> 11:08.376
Look, I don't care if you guys laugh
at that or not. [laughs]

11:08.501 --> 11:09.585
[continued laughter]

11:09.919 --> 11:12.338
-I was ignored my whole childhood.
-[woman cheers]

11:12.421 --> 11:15.341
Yeah, I would have loved
to have been at R. Kelly's house.

11:15.633 --> 11:16.842
[laughter]

11:17.134 --> 11:20.721
Oh my God, there would have been
so many kids to play with.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.431
[laughing]

11:22.848 --> 11:26.560
Oh, man, what a sick game of tag
that would have been.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.603
[audience oohs]

11:28.938 --> 11:31.607
I don't know. R. Kelly's a guy
that put out a song called

11:31.691 --> 11:33.025
"I Believe I Can Fly." Like...

11:33.609 --> 11:34.819
If he thought he could fly,

11:34.902 --> 11:38.072
he definitely thought he could fuck
some kids and get away with it.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.573
[laughter]

11:40.408 --> 11:43.244
I know. Some of you guys
are getting upset, so...

11:43.411 --> 11:44.662
[woman cackles]

11:45.287 --> 11:46.914
We'll change the material a little bit.

11:46.997 --> 11:49.667
Let's talk about
the Michael Jackson documentary.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.043
[uproarious laughter]

11:51.335 --> 11:52.753
-[applause]
-Ooh. [sighs]

11:54.338 --> 11:56.465
A much classier rape story.

11:56.632 --> 11:57.800
[laughter]

11:58.884 --> 12:01.804
I don't know. I like how he got
the whole family involved.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.058
Just flying the whole family first class
all around the country,

12:06.142 --> 12:08.728
you're like, wow, if you're a victim
of R. Kelly's watching that,

12:08.811 --> 12:10.187
how pissed are you?

12:10.354 --> 12:11.480
[audience laughs]

12:12.732 --> 12:15.818
You're like, "That dude wouldn't even
give me a ham sandwich."

12:16.068 --> 12:17.695
-[continued laughter]
-[Adrienne chuckles]

12:19.155 --> 12:20.489
I asked my friend, I was like,

12:20.573 --> 12:22.950
"Would you rather have gotten fucked
by white Michael Jackson

12:23.033 --> 12:24.118
or black Michael Jackson?"

12:25.745 --> 12:27.413
He said white 'cause he's racist.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.039
[laughing]

12:29.582 --> 12:31.625
I was like, "The correct answer is black."

12:32.752 --> 12:36.046
Yeah, that's when you want to get fucked
by him, when he was <i>Thriller.</i>

12:36.130 --> 12:37.715
Top of his game, yeah.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.301
You don't want to get fucked
by white Michael Jackson.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.220
That's when he was writing songs
about whales.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.305
[laughter]

12:48.559 --> 12:50.978
Dangling kids off of fire escapes.

12:53.814 --> 12:56.776
White Michael Jackson was also
physically falling apart.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.195
He kept getting those nose surgeries

12:59.278 --> 13:02.740
where his nose is getting smaller
and smaller and smaller.

13:02.823 --> 13:06.744
And I think he just thought he could get
his face further in their ass cracks.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.662
[oohs and laughter]

13:10.623 --> 13:11.624
Like, "Hm..."

13:12.082 --> 13:13.709
[applause]

13:14.627 --> 13:16.128
-[cheering]
-Ah!

13:18.130 --> 13:21.008
"One more surgery,
I'm going to taste kidneys." [laughs]

13:21.091 --> 13:23.260
-[uproarious laughter]
-[Adrienne giggles]

13:25.137 --> 13:25.971
Guys...

13:26.555 --> 13:28.766
I think I'm gonna be a good mom. [laughs]

13:28.849 --> 13:30.100
[laughter and cheering]

13:30.392 --> 13:31.268
Yeah.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.479
If Michael Jackson was fucking
one of my kids,

13:33.562 --> 13:35.815
-I would have just fucked one of his.
-[laughing]

13:36.941 --> 13:39.944
Be like, "All right, Curtain." [laughs]

13:40.319 --> 13:42.488
"You're not going to have fun at my house.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.241
I live up a five-flight walk up."

13:45.324 --> 13:46.325
[laughter]

13:46.617 --> 13:49.453
They'd go home, be like, "Dad,
you gotta stop fucking her kids.

13:50.037 --> 13:52.706
She got us doing her dishes
and walking her dog." [laughs]

13:52.873 --> 13:53.707
[laughing]

13:55.709 --> 13:58.379
I know that's a joke, obviously. [laughs]

13:58.462 --> 13:59.922
I don't know how anyone fucks kids.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.132
Kids are so annoying, it makes me wonder.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.301
[laughter]

14:05.427 --> 14:07.888
Like, I just picture some guy
trying to jerk off some kid

14:07.972 --> 14:10.391
and the whole time the kid's like,
"I want juice.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.476
[continued laughter]

14:13.602 --> 14:15.729
I want to watch TV."

14:17.231 --> 14:20.067
And I picture some poor pedophile
with his pants around his ankles like,

14:20.150 --> 14:22.528
"I can't believe I got to get
this kid a juice box.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.739
Way to ruin the mood, dick."

14:25.906 --> 14:26.949
[laughing]

14:27.283 --> 14:28.951
The he comes back and he gives it to him,

14:29.034 --> 14:31.370
he'd be like, "I don't want apple juice,
I want grape juice."

14:31.453 --> 14:32.746
He'd be like, "Oh!

14:33.038 --> 14:36.292
You're so fucking annoying,
I can't even enjoy this."

14:36.417 --> 14:37.334
[audience laughs]

14:37.960 --> 14:39.253
This is my shit.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.381
I feel like if they want people to not
fuck kids,

14:42.464 --> 14:43.716
they should let them watch them.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.427
[laughter]

14:47.845 --> 14:51.473
Yeah, I was 99.9% sure
I never wanted to fuck a kid.

14:52.975 --> 14:56.812
Then I babysat my nephew and I was like,
"Oh, I'm 100% sure."

14:57.938 --> 15:00.357
I never want to fuck a kid, like,

15:00.441 --> 15:04.403
there's no thought in my head like,
"Maybe I just haven't met the right one.

15:04.528 --> 15:05.571
[audience laughs]

15:08.824 --> 15:11.118
Maybe I'm going to the wrong playgrounds."

15:11.201 --> 15:12.661
[audience oohs]

15:14.914 --> 15:17.499
The summer is over, though,
that's upsetting, right?

15:17.791 --> 15:21.253
Everybody loves the summer, you know?
Except for, like, school shooters.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.213
[laughing]

15:24.340 --> 15:26.342
-Oof...
-[scattered applause]

15:27.009 --> 15:29.219
They have just been
counting down the days.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.180
-[continued laughter]
-[Adrienne chuckles]

15:32.222 --> 15:34.516
Doing their back-to-school shooting
shopping.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.146
Seeing their friends in Kmart.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.983
And being like, "You're not going to need
any of that stuff."

15:43.275 --> 15:45.194
[woman cackles]

15:47.321 --> 15:49.823
Oh, my God, look... [sighs]

15:53.160 --> 15:56.038
I know. There's so many school shootings
that there has to be

15:56.121 --> 15:59.416
at least one teacher out there
that's just like, "Thank God."

15:59.541 --> 16:00.793
[laughing]

16:01.251 --> 16:03.671
Like, "Ugh, I thought this day
would never end."

16:06.256 --> 16:08.884
I know. They want teachers
to take a bullet for $30,000,

16:08.968 --> 16:10.928
you're like, "That's not enough money."

16:11.637 --> 16:14.223
Yeah, you have a better chance
during a school shooting happening

16:14.306 --> 16:17.977
a teacher taking their own gun out
and being like, "Let me get this."

16:18.102 --> 16:19.269
[continued laughter]

16:19.395 --> 16:22.564
"Ah, this kid has not sat down
all fucking year."

16:22.731 --> 16:24.733
[laughter and applause]

16:26.485 --> 16:28.320
There are so many school shootings,
it's like,

16:28.404 --> 16:29.863
"How do you even pick a favorite?"

16:29.947 --> 16:31.699
-Um... [chuckles]
-[audience laughs]

16:32.950 --> 16:34.702
I'm kidding, they're all awful.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.371
Let's just say we have
a problem in this country,

16:37.454 --> 16:39.707
and I don't think the government's
gonna anything about it.

16:39.790 --> 16:40.833
That's why if I had kids,

16:40.958 --> 16:43.711
I would just take matters
into my own hands. I'd be like,

16:43.794 --> 16:47.464
"When you go to school, you make friends
with the most awkward kid in there.

16:47.589 --> 16:48.465
[laughter]

16:48.757 --> 16:52.177
The kids sitting in the corner making
no eye contact is your best friend."

16:53.345 --> 16:57.725
If he's like, "What if I get made fun of?"
I'm like, "That's how you earn his trust."

16:57.891 --> 16:59.059
[audience laughs]

17:00.728 --> 17:04.356
"You want to be the cool kid in school
or you want to make it to graduation?"

17:07.109 --> 17:10.279
Those shooters, why did they do it?
Because women wouldn't date them.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.532
It's like, "All right, ladies.
I've seen some of the guys you fucked.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.326
How about you take one for the team?"

17:16.452 --> 17:17.536
[laughing]

17:17.911 --> 17:20.873
I dated a guy with Asperger's
for two and a half years.

17:20.956 --> 17:23.751
Do you think that guy was my first choice?

17:24.209 --> 17:25.169
No.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.547
But I had a responsibility
to my community. [sighs]

17:28.630 --> 17:30.549
[audience laughs]

17:31.550 --> 17:35.012
Those two and a half years, not one
school shooting in my neighborhood.
