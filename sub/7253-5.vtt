00:02.043 --> 00:03.671
(male #1)

00:02.043 --> 00:03.671
'This is an important family.'

00:03.712 --> 00:05.923
'Marrying into it

00:03.712 --> 00:05.923
is important business.'

00:05.965 --> 00:08.717
A girl like Rory has no idea

00:05.965 --> 00:08.717
what it takes to be

00:08.759 --> 00:11.219
in this family, Logan.

00:08.759 --> 00:11.219
She wasn't bred for it.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.888
I don't understand.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.933
- They treated her like trash.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.933
- I highly doubt that.

00:15.975 --> 00:18.185
I have an internship available

00:15.975 --> 00:18.185
if you're interested.

00:18.226 --> 00:20.020
(Lorelai)

00:18.226 --> 00:20.020
'There is something wrong

00:18.226 --> 00:20.020
with this internship.'

00:20.061 --> 00:21.563
My God, you're paranoid.

00:21.605 --> 00:22.898
- It's tough business.

00:21.605 --> 00:22.898
- Definitely.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.191
You don't got it.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.693
- 'Rory's quitting Yale.'

00:24.232 --> 00:25.693
- What?

00:25.734 --> 00:27.068
'I thought between

00:25.734 --> 00:27.068
the three of us we could knock'

00:27.110 --> 00:28.529
some sense into her

00:27.110 --> 00:28.529
but I really need

00:28.570 --> 00:29.613
the two of you

00:28.570 --> 00:29.613
to back me up on this.

00:29.655 --> 00:30.948
Of course, we'll back you up.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.450
Rory will be taking

00:30.990 --> 00:33.450
some time off from Yale.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.536
'She will be moving into

00:33.492 --> 00:35.536
the pool house here with us.'

00:35.577 --> 00:37.663
(Lorelai)

00:35.577 --> 00:37.663
'Have you talked to Rory

00:35.577 --> 00:37.663
about this? Your great plan?'

00:37.705 --> 00:39.832
(Richard)

00:37.705 --> 00:39.832
'She told me what

00:37.705 --> 00:39.832
she wanted in her own words.'

00:41.709 --> 00:44.586
- Oh! Winded. Too many steps.

00:41.709 --> 00:44.586
- I said I'd carry em'.

00:44.628 --> 00:47.464
- Need water. Gunga Din!

00:44.628 --> 00:47.464
- They're not that heavy.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.466
Yeah, you should take those

00:47.506 --> 00:49.466
steps out. They get in the way.

00:49.508 --> 00:52.093
First thing tomorrow.

00:49.508 --> 00:52.093
Man, you bought a lot of stuff.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.345
All stuff I need or want

00:53.387 --> 00:54.555
or think I might someday

00:53.387 --> 00:54.555
need or want.

00:54.596 --> 00:55.890
Okay, well, let's find

00:54.596 --> 00:55.890
your new wallet.

00:55.931 --> 00:57.391
Oh, we can get it later.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.309
No, it's buried

00:57.432 --> 00:59.309
in here somewhere.

00:59.351 --> 01:00.561
Have I looked

00:59.351 --> 01:00.561
in this bag already?

01:00.602 --> 01:02.312
You didn't have

01:00.602 --> 01:02.312
to buy me a new wallet.

01:02.354 --> 01:04.815
- My old wallet was fine.

01:02.354 --> 01:04.815
- Your old wallet has Velcro.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.984
- It works.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.984
- It's disgusting.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.652
Come on, let's find it.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.652
Wait a second.

01:08.694 --> 01:11.112
- What is this?

01:08.694 --> 01:11.112
- Your underwear.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.990
Oh, thanks a lot.

01:13.032 --> 01:15.242
I didn't see how big they were.

01:13.032 --> 01:15.242
What are they doing in there?

01:15.283 --> 01:16.744
Well, I'm guessing,

01:15.283 --> 01:16.744
probably hiding

01:16.785 --> 01:18.203
from their real owners,

01:16.785 --> 01:18.203
'cause I would hate

01:18.245 --> 01:19.496
to be wrapped around

01:18.245 --> 01:19.496
the woman who fit those.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.206
No, you just grabbed

01:19.538 --> 01:21.206
the wrong bag.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.416
Oh, poor thing, she's single.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.625
[cellphone ringing]

01:23.667 --> 01:25.293
[clears throat]

01:25.335 --> 01:27.295
It still applies.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.756
Hello?

01:28.797 --> 01:30.173
Sookie, Sookie slow down.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.675
I can't understand

01:30.215 --> 01:31.675
a word you're saying.

01:31.717 --> 01:32.927
She's got huge feet.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.012
- The inn's on fire?

01:32.968 --> 01:35.012
- What?

01:35.054 --> 01:36.304
Oh, the stove is on fire?

01:36.346 --> 01:38.974
Well, put it out.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.974
It's out?

01:39.016 --> 01:40.601
So, you're saying there was

01:39.016 --> 01:40.601
a fire but now it's out.

01:40.642 --> 01:44.021
- Good, what's the damage?

01:40.642 --> 01:44.021
- You had a fire?

01:44.063 --> 01:47.482
Okay, okay, good.

01:44.063 --> 01:47.482
I'll be right there.

01:47.524 --> 01:48.943
The wall behind the stove

01:47.524 --> 01:48.943
have caught fire.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.485
There's damage but nothing

01:48.984 --> 01:50.485
major. Thank God.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.653
Come on. I'll take you.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.363
Oh, my God,

01:51.695 --> 01:53.363
another fire at the inn

01:53.405 --> 01:55.240
like the Independence Inn.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.240
Oh no.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.867
Am I a fire starter?

01:55.282 --> 01:56.867
I'm a fire starter, aren't I?

01:56.909 --> 01:59.202
You are not a fire starter.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.202
Caesar, we'll be right back.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.454
- What about the bags?

01:59.244 --> 02:00.454
- Caesar will put the bags away.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.956
- Let's go.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.956
- No, go first.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.958
In case things burst

02:01.997 --> 02:03.958
into flames behind me as I walk.

02:03.999 --> 02:04.833

before my eyes

that's how traumatic it was!

03:04.434 --> 03:07.562
She's been Scarlett O'Hara

03:04.434 --> 03:07.562
for two hours. It's sickening.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.524
My whole life, flash.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.524
I mean, that's upsetting!

03:10.565 --> 03:12.567
You know, not that

03:10.565 --> 03:12.567
it's been a bad life

03:12.609 --> 03:14.486
although I could have skipped

03:12.609 --> 03:14.486
seeing "Mummenschanz."

03:14.528 --> 03:16.071
Do you want to hand me

03:14.528 --> 03:16.071
the screwdriver?

03:16.113 --> 03:17.823
I would kinda need

03:16.113 --> 03:17.823
a third hand to do that.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.033
Why are the boy's bickering?

03:19.074 --> 03:20.450
There's something

03:19.074 --> 03:20.450
in the air today.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.036
Could you not shine

03:20.492 --> 03:22.036
that in my face?

03:22.077 --> 03:24.579
- Just move your face.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.579
- You mean off of my head?

03:24.621 --> 03:27.206
So, Mutt and Jeff,

03:24.621 --> 03:27.206
what's the prognosis there?

03:27.248 --> 03:29.084
When's the last time

03:27.248 --> 03:29.084
you checked your ductwork?

03:29.126 --> 03:32.171
Never. Oh, boy, I shouldn't

03:29.126 --> 03:32.171
be allowed in a kitchen.

03:32.211 --> 03:33.547
My guess is that the grease

03:33.588 --> 03:35.841
built up in the back

03:33.588 --> 03:35.841
and ventilation's

03:35.883 --> 03:37.885
not great, the wall

03:35.883 --> 03:37.885
heated up and burned.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.220
- So what do we do?

03:37.926 --> 03:40.220
- Don't tell me we're shut down.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.222
You have to repair the wall

03:40.261 --> 03:42.222
before you put the stove back

03:42.263 --> 03:44.432
and you're gonna have

03:42.263 --> 03:44.432
to clean your ductwork.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.226
Which means closing

03:44.474 --> 03:46.226
the kitchen till you do.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.770
- Well, then, fix it now.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.770
- You need a pro to do this.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.271
And if an insurance guy

03:48.812 --> 03:50.271
doesn't see it

03:50.313 --> 03:51.899
before you fix it,

03:50.313 --> 03:51.899
he won't pay.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.817
Well, I've already talked

03:51.940 --> 03:53.817
to the insurance company.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.110
They've never heard of us.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.737
That's impossible,

03:55.152 --> 03:56.737
we're customers.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.155
We send them a check

03:56.778 --> 03:58.155
every month.

03:58.197 --> 03:59.823
The people I talked to,

03:58.197 --> 03:59.823
all very rude

03:59.865 --> 04:01.408
by the way, they said

03:59.865 --> 04:01.408
they don't even cover

04:01.449 --> 04:02.743
businesses such as ours.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.703
Again a mistake.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.703
I'll get the policy out.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.580
I'll call them myself.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.580
Thank you.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.749
You really should

04:06.621 --> 04:08.749
get a second screwdriver.

04:08.790 --> 04:09.958
Nag, nag, nag.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.459
We should be flayed.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.087
Don't overreact, Nora.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.838
We should never have let

04:13.128 --> 04:14.838
it get to this point.

04:14.880 --> 04:15.923
We're all at fault here.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.591
It's a humiliation.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.761
Ladies, we know this, no one

04:17.632 --> 04:20.761
is more embarrassed than myself

04:20.802 --> 04:21.887
but what are we going to do?

04:21.929 --> 04:23.847
How many tables

04:21.929 --> 04:23.847
are still unsold?

04:23.889 --> 04:26.474
- Over half.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.474
- Oh! Unbelievable!

04:26.516 --> 04:28.560
This is a function

04:26.516 --> 04:28.560
for our troops.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.562
We'll be the laughingstock

04:28.602 --> 04:30.562
of the DAR.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.439
We'll lose

04:30.604 --> 04:32.439
our national accreditation

04:32.480 --> 04:34.024
and this is a very weak drink.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.484
- It's just punch, Nora.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.484
- My point, dear.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.278
I simply don't

04:36.526 --> 04:38.278
understand people.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.488
This money was designated

04:38.319 --> 04:40.488
for additional armor

04:40.530 --> 04:42.116
for the boys at Fort Drum.

04:42.157 --> 04:45.077
We've insulted the organization,

04:42.157 --> 04:45.077
insulted our troops.

04:45.119 --> 04:47.913
We might as well all march to

04:45.119 --> 04:47.913
Mount Vernon, drop our drawers

04:47.955 --> 04:50.540
and do something foul

04:47.955 --> 04:50.540
on George Washington's grave.

04:50.582 --> 04:51.875
- Nora!

04:50.582 --> 04:51.875
- 'I'm sorry.'

04:51.917 --> 04:54.211
But I'm<i> really</i> upset about this

04:54.253 --> 04:57.547
and I'm far too sober to put it

04:54.253 --> 04:57.547
in any sort of perspective.

04:57.589 --> 05:00.383
But the function is still a week

04:57.589 --> 05:00.383
away. There's time to fix this.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.552
Oh! Rory, you're darling.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.805
- She's new, ladies.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.805
- A week is nothing.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.514
Again, what do we do?

05:06.556 --> 05:09.434
- We should cancel the event.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.434
- This is a nightmare.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.271
Is Constance not showing

05:09.476 --> 05:12.271
her face on purpose?

05:12.312 --> 05:14.022
- Would you?

05:12.312 --> 05:14.022
- Why would Constance..

05:14.064 --> 05:15.857
She's running

05:14.064 --> 05:15.857
the event into the ground.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.818
I blame myself.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.818
I let her talk me into it.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.154
She's never slipped up

05:17.859 --> 05:20.154
like this before.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.156
Is it definitely too late

05:20.195 --> 05:22.156
to do something?

05:22.197 --> 05:23.907
- To do what?

05:22.197 --> 05:23.907
- 'I don't know.'

05:23.949 --> 05:26.534
To publicize the event more,

05:23.949 --> 05:26.534
get those tables sold?

05:26.576 --> 05:28.829
We spent our budget

05:26.576 --> 05:28.829
for publicity. We're wiped out.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.956
But a budget

05:28.870 --> 05:30.956
is just an estimation.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.499
It's guesswork. Fake numbers.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.709
In any business endeavor

05:32.540 --> 05:34.709
sometimes it makes sense

05:34.751 --> 05:38.005
to run a deficit in order to

05:34.751 --> 05:38.005
achieve a bigger payoff later.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.339
We're lunching

05:38.046 --> 05:40.339
with Grover Norquist.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.176
Well, have we tried

05:40.381 --> 05:42.176
getting the word out online?

05:42.217 --> 05:43.885
A lot can be done that way.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.429
'And maybe we could add

05:43.927 --> 05:46.429
some entertainment'

05:46.471 --> 05:48.431
or a theme,

05:46.471 --> 05:48.431
send out some e-mails.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.766
E-mailing doesn't cost a thing.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.059
We hadn't thought about e-mail.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.351
I think there's a way

05:51.101 --> 05:52.351
to correct this.

05:52.393 --> 05:53.854
A week is plenty of time.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.523
Well, well, well,

05:53.895 --> 05:56.523
we have a star amongst us.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.565
- Who?

05:56.564 --> 05:57.565
- You.

05:57.607 --> 05:58.859
- Me?

05:57.607 --> 05:58.859
- Take it over.

05:58.900 --> 05:59.985
What?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.862
I think that's a wonderful idea!

06:01.903 --> 06:03.905
I don't know.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.905
We have a mountain here, ladies.

06:03.947 --> 06:07.034
We're screwing the pooch, Emily

06:03.947 --> 06:07.034
and we've got to go balls out.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.660
I, for one, will not have those

06:08.702 --> 06:10.662
'priggish twigs

06:08.702 --> 06:10.662
from the New York chapters'

06:10.704 --> 06:12.164
'lording this over us.'

06:12.206 --> 06:14.208
We need to take a swing here

06:14.249 --> 06:16.210
and Babe Ruth sits before us.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.461
- You shouldn't feel pressured.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.461
- I know.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.630
My essence is that if Rory

06:18.503 --> 06:20.630
doesn't think

06:20.672 --> 06:22.674
she can do it,

06:20.672 --> 06:22.674
she'll turn us down.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.177
- I suppose that's true.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.177
- What do you say, slugger?

06:27.554 --> 06:30.140
- I'll do it.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.140
- Yes! Let's ring Constance.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.934
We'll put you in touch with the

06:30.182 --> 06:32.934
people at the venue immediately.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.602
And you'll have

06:32.976 --> 06:34.602
an assistant, Lacey.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.022
- You'll love her.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.022
- I'd look at the menu.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.773
(Nora)

06:37.064 --> 06:38.773
'I'll set up

06:37.064 --> 06:38.773
a discretionary fund.'

06:38.815 --> 06:41.526
This publicity idea you were

06:38.815 --> 06:41.526
thinking of may be the key.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.486
[indistinct chattering]

06:45.989 --> 06:48.158
[music on TV]

06:49.284 --> 06:50.535
Dig in, everybody.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.953
I'm past digging, I'm burrowing.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.496
This is delicious.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.250
Tri-tip on the barbecue,

06:53.538 --> 06:56.250
you can't beat it. Oh!

06:56.291 --> 06:57.292
Hey, you turn the barbecue off?

06:57.334 --> 06:58.626
The barbecue is off.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.295
- Good stuff, huh?

06:58.668 --> 07:00.295
- Really good.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.462
Thanks. Excuse me.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.382
Davey, turn the volume down!

07:03.422 --> 07:05.175
The vegetables are good, Sookie.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.344
Thanks, Luke.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.344
Davey, you heard your father.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.888
- Turn it down!

07:07.386 --> 07:09.888
- Oh, I'll turn it down.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.223
No, we want Davey to do it.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.515
That's how he learns.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.351
You heard me, son.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.351
Turn it down.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.519
- Turn it down!

07:14.393 --> 07:16.519
- Right now.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.772
Ooh, I need a lemon slice.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.108
So, did anybody see that

07:18.813 --> 07:21.108
new show on TV last night?

07:21.149 --> 07:22.483
The one where they

07:21.149 --> 07:22.483
were solving crimes

07:22.525 --> 07:23.944
by cutting bodies open

07:22.525 --> 07:23.944
and poking their organs?

07:23.985 --> 07:25.279
No.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.696
The one where

07:25.320 --> 07:26.696
they're solving crimes

07:26.738 --> 07:28.282
from 30 years ago

07:26.738 --> 07:28.282
by going to graveyards

07:28.323 --> 07:30.491
and cutting open bodies

07:28.323 --> 07:30.491
and poking their organs?

07:30.533 --> 07:31.743
- No.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.743
- Oh.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.786
The one where

07:31.785 --> 07:32.786
people are missing

07:32.827 --> 07:34.204
and then they find their bodies

07:34.246 --> 07:35.747
and cut them open,

07:34.246 --> 07:35.747
and poke their organs

07:35.789 --> 07:36.831
and that's how

07:35.789 --> 07:36.831
they solve crimes?

07:36.873 --> 07:38.333
- No.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.333
- What else is on?

07:38.375 --> 07:40.668
You gotta turn the TV down, son!

07:40.710 --> 07:42.170
Are you sure

07:40.710 --> 07:42.170
you don't want me to--

07:42.212 --> 07:43.671
He's got to learn.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.671
You heard me, son!

07:43.713 --> 07:46.091
- Volume down!

07:46.133 --> 07:47.717
Listen to your mother.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.095
Now, what's that show

07:47.759 --> 07:50.095
I'm thinking of?

07:50.137 --> 07:51.972
I'm back.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.348
You like the squash, Luke?

07:53.390 --> 07:55.016
Oh, this is gonna bug me.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.435
I'm not a big fan of the squash.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.186
Oh, I forgot the pepper flakes.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.604
Sookie, your food's

07:58.228 --> 07:59.604
getting cold.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.856
- I thought you liked squash.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.856
- Nope.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.524
What's that vegetable

08:01.898 --> 08:03.524
I thought you liked?

08:03.566 --> 08:05.360
Hey, Sookie, do you have

08:03.566 --> 08:05.360
a fork for Paul Anka?

08:05.402 --> 08:07.487
He likes his own fork.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.487
Plastic preferred.

08:07.528 --> 08:08.655
Got one here.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.031
Oh, now,<i> this</i> is gonna bug me.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.741
What is that vegetable?

08:11.783 --> 08:14.202
The plastic's too high

08:11.783 --> 08:14.202
for me to reach. It's up there.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.496
Oh, I'll get it.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.496
You have to eat.

08:16.537 --> 08:17.831
Jackson, what's that smell?

08:17.872 --> 08:19.540
Oh, man, I left the barbecue on.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.376
We cannot set this place

08:19.582 --> 08:21.376
on fire too.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.420
I have had enough

08:21.418 --> 08:23.420
fires this week.

08:23.462 --> 08:26.006
I'll get it.

08:23.462 --> 08:26.006
Turn the volume down, Davey.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.466
I'm not gonna tell you twice.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.009
(Lorelai)

08:27.507 --> 08:29.009
'Here you go.'

08:29.050 --> 08:30.969
It's nice and lean,

08:29.050 --> 08:30.969
the way you like it.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.804
(Sookie)

08:31.011 --> 08:32.804
Dog who doesn't like fat

08:31.011 --> 08:32.804
is just weird.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.683
He's not weird. He's trying

08:32.846 --> 08:36.683
to maintain bathing-suit figure.

08:36.724 --> 08:39.769
So, speaking of my least

08:36.724 --> 08:39.769
favorite word in the world, fire

08:39.811 --> 08:41.396
where are we

08:39.811 --> 08:41.396
with the insurance company?

08:41.438 --> 08:43.648
Ah, nowhere. I got the same

08:41.438 --> 08:43.648
run-around they gave Michel.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.942
Then let's just do the work.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.942
Forget the insurance.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.361
Give me back my kitchen.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.862
Tom's all ready to jump in

08:48.903 --> 08:50.113
but we can't afford to do it

08:50.155 --> 08:51.156
without the insurance money.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.282
That's why we have insurance.

08:52.324 --> 08:53.992
We have stupid insurance.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.285
I mean, this policy,

08:54.034 --> 08:55.285
wasn't it set up by your--

08:55.327 --> 08:56.328
Yes.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.371
If we're getting the run-around

08:57.412 --> 08:58.413
does it mean that you have to..

08:58.455 --> 08:59.789
- Yes.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.789
- Sorry.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.916
I know, it seemed like

08:59.831 --> 09:01.916
a good idea at the time.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.544
- I'll call him tomorrow.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.544
- Barbecue's off.

09:04.585 --> 09:05.879
Martha's up.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.340
I'm on it.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.340
Turn the TV down, Davey.

09:08.382 --> 09:11.051
(Sookie)

09:08.382 --> 09:11.051
'Turn it down. You heard us,

09:08.382 --> 09:11.051
turn it down.'

09:11.092 --> 09:13.636
I-I'm gonna count to ten, Davey

09:13.678 --> 09:16.597
then the TV is going off

09:13.678 --> 09:16.597
for the rest of the week.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.974
Ten.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.476
'Nine.'

09:19.518 --> 09:20.810
'Eight.'

09:20.852 --> 09:21.936
'Seven.'

09:21.978 --> 09:23.188
'Six.'

09:23.230 --> 09:24.481
'Five.'

09:24.523 --> 09:25.940
'Four.'

09:25.982 --> 09:27.275
'Three.'

09:27.317 --> 09:28.902
'Two. One.'

09:31.696 --> 09:33.614
[clock ticking]

09:37.160 --> 09:39.829
- She threw out the menu.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.829
- Hmm?

09:39.871 --> 09:42.874
Rory, she's changed

09:39.871 --> 09:42.874
the entire menu.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.625
What menu?

09:44.667 --> 09:46.002
Richard, listen when

09:44.667 --> 09:46.002
I talk to you.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.421
I'm sorry, Emily.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.630
Takes a second to emerge

09:47.462 --> 09:49.630
from Samuel Beckett.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.133
He's a strange man. Go on.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.969
Rory threw out the entire menu

09:52.175 --> 09:54.969
for the Fort Drum event.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.846
'I mean, granted,

09:55.011 --> 09:56.846
Constance was going'

09:56.888 --> 09:58.723
'with Cornish game hen,

09:56.888 --> 09:58.723
been there, done that'

09:58.765 --> 10:01.142
'and her fetish for

09:58.765 --> 10:01.142
Brussels sprouts is upsetting.'

10:01.184 --> 10:04.312
But to throw out the entire

10:01.184 --> 10:04.312
menu? So close to the event?

10:04.354 --> 10:07.399
I can't say that I'm a big fan

10:04.354 --> 10:07.399
of DAR cuisine

10:07.441 --> 10:09.025
so, I may not be of much help.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.278
I'm trying not to butt in

10:09.067 --> 10:11.278
but how can I not worry?

10:11.319 --> 10:13.530
By not thinking about it.

10:13.572 --> 10:16.450
- Is there still a USO?

10:13.572 --> 10:16.450
- I think so. Why?

10:16.491 --> 10:17.992
That's the theme, the USO.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.912
Or that's where it's being held.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.540
Oh, my God, she didn't change

10:20.954 --> 10:23.540
the menu and the location?

10:23.582 --> 10:26.000
- Is that possible?

10:23.582 --> 10:26.000
- You should ask her.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.461
I'm trying to keep out of it.

10:27.502 --> 10:30.046
You're doing a terrific job.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.799
She's not serving salmon puffs.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.675
Good night, Mr. Beckett.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.553
We've never not served

10:34.717 --> 10:36.553
salmon puffs.

10:36.595 --> 10:39.598
Not in 25 years have we staged

10:36.595 --> 10:39.598
an event without salmon puffs.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.601
Emily, please. It's Rory.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.019
What she tackles, she conquers.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.522
This girl could name

10:45.061 --> 10:47.522
the state capitals at three

10:47.564 --> 10:50.233
recite the periodic table

10:47.564 --> 10:50.233
at four

10:50.275 --> 10:51.734
discuss Schopenhauer's influence

10:51.776 --> 10:54.195
on Nietzsche when she was ten.

10:54.237 --> 10:57.574
She's read every book by every

10:54.237 --> 10:57.574
author with a Russian surname

10:57.616 --> 10:59.618
and had a 4.2

10:57.616 --> 10:59.618
grade-point average

10:59.659 --> 11:02.496
at one of the toughest schools

10:59.659 --> 11:02.496
on the east coast.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.539
'If she's excluding

11:02.537 --> 11:04.539
salmon puffs'

11:04.581 --> 11:07.334
she has a good reason

11:04.581 --> 11:07.334
to exclude salmon puffs.

11:07.375 --> 11:10.086
And I, for one,

11:07.375 --> 11:10.086
have complete confidence

11:10.128 --> 11:12.713
in her ability

11:10.128 --> 11:12.713
to tackle this job

11:12.755 --> 11:13.714
and so should you.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.927
Fine, go back to your Beckett.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.179
Thank you.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.474
Salmon puffs.

11:23.891 --> 11:26.520
We'll show 'em, huh, guys?

11:26.561 --> 11:29.648
We'll show 'em you don't need

11:26.561 --> 11:29.648
fancy stuff like stoves

11:29.730 --> 11:31.316
in order to make

11:29.730 --> 11:31.316
a delicious meal.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.402
We've got salads,

11:31.358 --> 11:34.402
lots and lots of salads

11:34.444 --> 11:37.572
caprese and endive and arugula

11:37.614 --> 11:40.492
and, ooh, cold sandwiches

11:37.614 --> 11:40.492
and beef Carpaccio

11:40.534 --> 11:41.784
and tuna Carpaccio

11:41.826 --> 11:43.786
and vegetable Carpaccio.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.746
Oh, my God. Am I ever

11:43.828 --> 11:45.746
gonna get the stove back?

11:45.788 --> 11:47.207
- I'm dying here!

11:45.788 --> 11:47.207
- Okay.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.917
Hang in there, hon. Thanks.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.462
Lorelai, I hope it's alright

11:49.959 --> 11:52.462
walking in like this.

11:52.504 --> 11:53.880
I knew where the kitchen was

11:53.921 --> 11:56.299
so, I just figured

11:53.921 --> 11:56.299
I'd come back. Sookie.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.468
You're our knight in shining

11:56.341 --> 11:58.468
armor, Mr. Gilmore.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.220
This is Harris,

11:58.510 --> 12:00.220
he'll do the inspection

12:00.261 --> 12:01.638
get the lay of the land.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.182
Shouldn't take long.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.182
Go ahead and start.

12:04.224 --> 12:08.520
I should apologize

12:04.224 --> 12:08.520
for the red tape and the delay.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.064
'As a rule, we don't take

12:08.562 --> 12:11.064
on small accounts like this'

12:11.105 --> 12:12.940
except under

12:11.105 --> 12:12.940
extraordinary circumstances.

12:12.982 --> 12:16.819
Until the news reached my desk,

12:12.982 --> 12:16.819
no one was sure of what to do.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.364
- Uh-huh.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.364
- I can write you a check today.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.157
I figured that would please you.

12:21.199 --> 12:22.200
Terrific.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.577
I'm gonna go call Tom

12:23.618 --> 12:25.370
and see if he can

12:23.618 --> 12:25.370
race right over here

12:25.412 --> 12:27.163
and start the work.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.416
Bless you, sir.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.416
You're my golden God.

12:38.508 --> 12:42.303
So, um...how's your big plan

12:38.508 --> 12:42.303
working out?

12:42.345 --> 12:44.931
- Excuse me?

12:42.345 --> 12:44.931
- Oh, your big plan for Rory.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.349
How's that going, dad?

12:46.391 --> 12:47.975
Let me know if you

12:46.391 --> 12:47.975
need anything, Harris.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.186
- Is she back at Yale?

12:48.017 --> 12:50.186
- Lorelai--

12:50.228 --> 12:53.147
- Oh, I take it she's not.

12:50.228 --> 12:53.147
- No, she's not.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.567
Huh! But it's in the works.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.651
We'll be here ten minutes.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.445
No, wait let me guess

12:58.486 --> 12:59.820
you're gonna trick her

12:58.486 --> 12:59.820
into going back, right?

12:59.862 --> 13:02.073
Like you'll drive up

12:59.862 --> 13:02.073
and drop her off at Yale

13:02.115 --> 13:03.408
and then you'll drive away

13:03.450 --> 13:04.825
really quickly

13:03.450 --> 13:04.825
before she catches on.

13:04.867 --> 13:05.868
Is that one of the plans?

13:05.910 --> 13:06.911
Is there anything I can do

13:06.953 --> 13:08.329
to expedite this, Harris?

13:08.371 --> 13:10.206
You see that family

13:08.371 --> 13:10.206
of Logan's recently

13:10.248 --> 13:11.458
The...Hamburgers?

13:11.499 --> 13:13.293
- Huntzbergers.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.293
- Right, right.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.793
How are the old Huntzbergers?

13:14.835 --> 13:16.129
They behaving any better

13:14.835 --> 13:16.129
than that night

13:16.170 --> 13:17.589
they humiliated

13:16.170 --> 13:17.589
your granddaughter?

13:17.631 --> 13:18.923
They did not humiliate her.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.300
Rory said they did.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.719
I know the Huntzbergers.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.719
They're fine people.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.679
What happened that night

13:22.761 --> 13:24.679
was a misunderstanding

13:24.721 --> 13:26.431
because they have

13:24.721 --> 13:26.431
nothing against Rory.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.724
- No?

13:26.473 --> 13:27.724
- Why would they?

13:27.766 --> 13:29.476
- Ask them!

13:27.766 --> 13:29.476
- It's not true.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.728
Well, then that granddaughter

13:29.517 --> 13:31.728
of yours, what a liar.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.522
Harris, take a couple

13:31.770 --> 13:34.522
of pictures and we'll go.

13:34.564 --> 13:37.651
We just need the quote

13:34.564 --> 13:37.651
from your contractor in writing.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.694
Send all his bills

13:37.692 --> 13:39.694
directly to me.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.571
- Will do.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.571
- Goodbye.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.661
It's been lovely.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.205
- What about silverware?

13:48.995 --> 13:51.205
- I can get you 1940s.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.831
They're real thing.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.831
It's plates though.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.250
- Plates are a toughie.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.250
- Plates break.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.293
I can get you

13:54.292 --> 13:55.293
a couple of dozen

13:55.335 --> 13:56.628
hand-painted, not a 100.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.046
So, what's our best bet,

13:56.670 --> 13:59.046
an off-white, new

13:59.088 --> 14:00.173
but made to look vintage?

14:00.214 --> 14:01.591
Off-white would be super.

14:01.633 --> 14:02.925
And they should be heavy,

14:01.633 --> 14:02.925
right, solid?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.093
Oh, my servers

14:02.967 --> 14:04.093
are gonna love that.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.386
Then not too heavy.

14:05.428 --> 14:06.513
Lacey, get me samples

14:05.428 --> 14:06.513
of all this?

14:06.554 --> 14:07.639
Will do.

14:07.681 --> 14:08.973
Now, there must be a color photo

14:09.015 --> 14:10.517
of the Hollywood Canteen.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.517
I mean..

14:10.558 --> 14:12.185
We've checked

14:10.558 --> 14:12.185
the internet. The library?

14:12.226 --> 14:13.936
The Getty in California

14:12.226 --> 14:13.936
has one in their collection

14:13.978 --> 14:15.522
but they're very flaky

14:13.978 --> 14:15.522
on the phone.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.774
- Oh, California.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.774
- I'm so over the west coast.

14:17.816 --> 14:18.857
A bunch of granola heads.

14:18.899 --> 14:20.193
[cellphone ringing]

14:20.234 --> 14:21.611
Rory Gilmore's phone.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.697
Who's calling?

14:21.653 --> 14:23.697
One moment, please.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.533
- It's Logan Huntzberger.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.533
- I'll take that.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.785
- Hello?

14:26.574 --> 14:28.785
- Oh, my God. Who was that?

14:28.827 --> 14:31.120
My assistant.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.120
I forwarded my phone to hers.

14:31.162 --> 14:33.247
- 'You have an assistant?'

14:31.162 --> 14:33.247
- Just for this DAR Thing.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.624
I get a million calls.

14:34.666 --> 14:37.043
I consider myself lucky

14:34.666 --> 14:37.043
to be patched through.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.545
'You have priority clearance.'

14:38.586 --> 14:40.213
So, good news,

14:38.586 --> 14:40.213
I got the PA system you wanted

14:40.254 --> 14:41.339
at the price you wanted.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.923
Really? Oh, cool.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.551
Lacey, PA system, done.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.219
- Excellent.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.219
- That's great.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.012
This guy's done the sound

14:46.260 --> 14:48.012
at every party I've ever thrown.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.222
He's the best in the business.

14:49.263 --> 14:50.849
[knock on door]

14:50.890 --> 14:54.143
And oh, goody. Paris is here.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.143
And she looks upset.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.729
That and a bulldozer

14:54.185 --> 14:55.729
would knock me over.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.647
Excuse me?

14:55.770 --> 14:57.647
The door is locked.

14:57.689 --> 14:58.898
Do you know her?

14:58.939 --> 15:00.400
Let her in, then hide.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.442
I'll call you later.

15:01.484 --> 15:02.569
Bye.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.946
"Do you know her?"

15:04.153 --> 15:05.946
I'm only her best friend.

15:05.988 --> 15:09.033
- Who the hell are you?

15:05.988 --> 15:09.033
- Paris, come here. Calm down.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.493
- What's wrong?

15:09.075 --> 15:10.493
- I'm broke.

15:10.535 --> 15:11.745
Broke? How?

15:11.786 --> 15:13.246
My parents flipped

15:11.786 --> 15:13.246
the bird at the IRS.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.288
One too many times.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.331
They've frozen everything.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.457
All I've got is my trust fund

15:16.499 --> 15:18.251
which doesn't kick in

15:16.499 --> 15:18.251
till I'm 25.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.960
So, unless you can

15:18.292 --> 15:19.960
whip out a magic wand

15:20.002 --> 15:21.838
and age me four years,

15:20.002 --> 15:21.838
I'm a goner.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.840
Just sit down.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.840
Calm down.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.633
My ATM refused me.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.260
I thought it was

15:25.675 --> 15:27.260
just that particular one.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.596
So, I went to another

15:27.301 --> 15:29.596
and it refused me too.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.972
So, I went to the bank

15:29.637 --> 15:31.972
and used a few choice expletives

15:32.014 --> 15:34.267
and a bunch of guys in suits

15:32.014 --> 15:34.267
started closing in on me.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.310
So, I started pacing

15:34.308 --> 15:36.310
and yelling, "Attica! Attica!"

15:36.352 --> 15:38.187
'Then the manager hit a little

15:36.352 --> 15:38.187
red button under his desk'

15:38.229 --> 15:40.356
so, I ran out of there

15:38.229 --> 15:40.356
and came right over here.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.983
I'm a pauper. I'll be playing

15:40.398 --> 15:42.983
a hurdy gurdy on street corners.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.569
And selling pencils

15:43.025 --> 15:44.569
out of a tin cup.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.487
- Slow down.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.487
- Yale's paid for..

15:46.529 --> 15:47.530
Through the end

15:46.529 --> 15:47.530
of the year, thank God.

15:47.572 --> 15:48.782
But what'll I do about

15:48.823 --> 15:50.742
everything else I need?

15:48.823 --> 15:50.742
What will I do?

15:50.784 --> 15:52.118
You'll just have to do

15:50.784 --> 15:52.118
what everyone else

15:52.159 --> 15:53.536
who needs money has to do.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.329
- What's that?

15:53.578 --> 15:55.329
- What people do.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.373
- What am I, a mind reader?

15:55.371 --> 15:57.373
- Get a job.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.417
A job? I've never had a job.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.836
'I don't know the first thing

15:59.459 --> 16:01.836
about having a job.'

16:01.878 --> 16:04.046
All I've got on my resume

16:01.878 --> 16:04.046
is academic achievements

16:04.088 --> 16:06.257
which will mean doodly-squat

16:04.088 --> 16:06.257
when I'm in line with 11,000

16:06.299 --> 16:07.425
people vying for an opening

16:07.467 --> 16:09.009
in the garden department

16:07.467 --> 16:09.009
at Walmart.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.971
Paris, wait. As you said,

16:09.051 --> 16:11.971
Yale's paid for.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.013
That's the bright side.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.056
From now on, you'll just have

16:14.098 --> 16:15.558
to keep your expenses low.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.310
And I could get you some work?

16:17.351 --> 16:18.478
Right away. How would that be?

16:18.519 --> 16:19.979
- Really?

16:18.519 --> 16:19.979
- Yes.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.689
I know you'll be a hard worker.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.689
That's a given.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.651
I definitely would be. And you

16:21.731 --> 16:24.651
know, I speak Chinese and Farsi.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.111
- If that'll help.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.111
- I need servers for the food.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.988
- You could do that, right?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.988
- I think so.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.949
See? You're on the road

16:29.029 --> 16:30.949
to recovery.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.867
Oh, thanks.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.704
And I'll work my butt off

16:34.828 --> 16:36.704
too, Glenda.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.457
Oh, and I know a smattering of

16:36.746 --> 16:39.457
ancient Aramaic, if that helps.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.501
- It could.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.501
- If Christ shows up.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.294
- And who are you?

16:41.542 --> 16:43.294
- Go home, Paris.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.045
- You've had a rough day.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.045
- I guess.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.422
I'll call you

16:45.087 --> 16:46.422
with the details.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.048
Thanks.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.135
Hey, uh, can you

16:48.090 --> 16:51.135
spot me a 20?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.095
- Sure.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.095
- 5, 25?

16:53.137 --> 16:56.098
- Oh, here you go.

16:53.137 --> 16:56.098
- Thanks.

16:59.769 --> 17:02.313
I owe you more

16:59.769 --> 17:02.313
than you currently realize.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.314
Okay, where were we?

17:05.107 --> 17:07.234
Pasta's almost done,

17:05.107 --> 17:07.234
sauce is close too.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.320
You know, we could've just used

17:07.276 --> 17:09.320
the store-bought sauce I have.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.822
Oh, That stuff is junk.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.365
Oh, it's delicious

17:10.864 --> 17:12.365
Italian sauce.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.783
Okay, first off, it's not.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.994
Second, all you had

17:13.825 --> 17:15.994
was four already-opened jars

17:16.035 --> 17:17.370
two of which I couldn't

17:16.035 --> 17:17.370
get the lids off of.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.621
Somebody needs some gym time.

17:18.663 --> 17:19.747
And one of them had a layer

17:19.789 --> 17:21.374
of white fuzz on it.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.584
- That was a little gross.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.584
- And the last one, green fuzz.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.003
- Also gross.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.003
- I make better.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.379
Just like mama taught me.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.882
I know you do.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.882
How's Paul Anka's dinner coming?

17:28.923 --> 17:30.424
His hamburger's close too.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.134
You're not overcooking it,

17:30.466 --> 17:32.134
'cause you know

17:32.176 --> 17:33.678
he likes it rare plus, you know

17:33.720 --> 17:35.304
'not too rare,

17:33.720 --> 17:35.304
but not medium rare.'

17:35.346 --> 17:38.683
I'm cooking it to his

17:35.346 --> 17:38.683
exacting specifications.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.059
Miss Patty's having a recital?

17:40.100 --> 17:41.268
'Oh, yeah.'

17:41.310 --> 17:43.062
It's her big annual show.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.231
All her kids in all her

17:43.103 --> 17:45.231
classes get to perform.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.107
It's be there or be square,

17:45.272 --> 17:47.107
best show in town.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.317
This Thursday, right?

17:47.149 --> 17:48.317
It's a good night.

17:48.359 --> 17:50.737
- I'll have Caesar close for me.

17:48.359 --> 17:50.737
- Why?

17:50.778 --> 17:52.363
- So I can go with you.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.363
- Oh, no.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.406
Luke, you're not going

17:52.405 --> 17:53.406
to this recital.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.866
Why not?

17:54.908 --> 17:56.743
Because it's a night

17:54.908 --> 17:56.743
of kids dancing

17:56.784 --> 17:58.953
'singing, twirling batons,

17:56.784 --> 17:58.953
you'll hate it.'

17:58.995 --> 18:00.663
- No, I won't.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.663
- Yes, you will.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.249
It's not my first choice

18:00.705 --> 18:03.249
in entertainment, but I'll go.

18:03.290 --> 18:06.210
Luke, no, you have been

18:03.290 --> 18:06.210
sacrificing too much of yourself

18:06.252 --> 18:08.004
these past few months.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.004
You go with me to my movies.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.714
'You tag along

18:08.046 --> 18:09.714
when I go shopping.'

18:09.756 --> 18:11.173
And that dinner at Sookie

18:09.756 --> 18:11.173
and Jackson's, how you kept

18:11.215 --> 18:12.884
from killing

18:11.215 --> 18:12.884
us all, I'll never know.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.552
I haven't been complaining

18:12.926 --> 18:14.552
about any of this.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.679
I know, and that has filled

18:14.594 --> 18:16.679
me with no end of guilt.

18:16.721 --> 18:19.807
You've been a saint, but you've

18:16.721 --> 18:19.807
gotta do your Luke stuff too.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.935
When was the last time

18:19.849 --> 18:21.935
you went camping or fishing?

18:21.976 --> 18:23.352
You don't like camping

18:21.976 --> 18:23.352
or fishing.

18:23.394 --> 18:24.979
That shouldn't stop

18:23.394 --> 18:24.979
you from camping or fishing.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.397
I'd go if I felt like it.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.441
Well, then go Thursday

18:26.439 --> 18:28.441
while I'm at the recital.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.150
I'll go with Sookie.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.150
It'll be fun with her.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.028
- You sure?

18:30.192 --> 18:32.028
- Yeah, go.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.279
You haven't

18:32.070 --> 18:33.279
been camping in forever.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.155
Be "Grizzly Adams."

18:35.197 --> 18:36.824
Okay, sure,

18:35.197 --> 18:36.824
I'll go camping.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.284
Good.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.911
Oh, that's officially it.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.412
Oh, medium rare,

18:39.953 --> 18:41.412
not rare plus.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.413
I'll get him another.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.458
I don't know why I had bothered.

18:45.499 --> 18:48.252
The great books take practically

18:45.499 --> 18:48.252
a lifetime to read as it is.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.755
But if you heed the word

18:48.294 --> 18:50.755
of Mortimer Adler

18:50.797 --> 18:52.924
"One needs to read

18:50.797 --> 18:52.924
a classic three times

18:52.966 --> 18:54.592
to fully comprehend

18:52.966 --> 18:54.592
its meaning."

18:54.634 --> 18:55.635
Yeah.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.928
I wonder if Mortimer ever read

18:56.970 --> 18:58.763
'"Euclid's Geometry"

18:56.970 --> 18:58.763
three times.'

18:58.805 --> 19:00.932
<i>That's</i> a fun read.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.101
Have you read

19:00.974 --> 19:03.101
"Euclid's Geometry"?

19:03.142 --> 19:05.603
- Me? No.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.603
- It doesn't get any drier.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.938
'What have you

19:05.645 --> 19:06.938
been reading lately?'

19:06.980 --> 19:08.689
'I keep forgetting to ask.'

19:08.731 --> 19:10.900
- Rory?

19:08.731 --> 19:10.900
- Sorry, guys.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.318
The event's

19:10.942 --> 19:12.318
right around the corner

19:12.359 --> 19:14.153
and I just keep thinking

19:12.359 --> 19:14.153
of things I have to do.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.613
I'm just texting Lacey.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.615
- So how's that going?

19:15.655 --> 19:17.615
- Good, really good.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.033
Good.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.576
Did Lacey mention partitions?

19:20.618 --> 19:22.244
- Partitions?

19:20.618 --> 19:22.244
- At Wafford Hall.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.664
It's so big, and these

19:22.286 --> 19:24.664
partitions can cut the room

19:24.705 --> 19:26.666
wherever you like, so,

19:24.705 --> 19:26.666
it won't look so empty.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.250
'They're not very

19:26.707 --> 19:28.250
decorative, but they work.'

19:28.292 --> 19:30.920
Oh. Hold on just a second.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.755
- Partitions?

19:30.962 --> 19:32.755
- For the room.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.882
But we won't have any room,

19:32.797 --> 19:34.882
we're sold out.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.051
Sold out?

19:34.924 --> 19:37.051
That's not possible.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.386
Oh, it's a fact. The theme

19:37.093 --> 19:39.386
got people's attention.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.348
Plus, the online campaign

19:39.428 --> 19:42.348
went like gangbusters.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.724
We're having to

19:42.389 --> 19:43.724
turn people away.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.392
That's what I was

19:43.766 --> 19:45.392
texting Lacey about.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.978
I'm trying to squeeze

19:45.434 --> 19:46.978
in a few more

19:47.020 --> 19:48.646
but we're fighting the fire

19:47.020 --> 19:48.646
department over it.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.023
You're turning people away?

19:50.064 --> 19:51.398
But still encouraging them

19:51.440 --> 19:53.818
to give a sizable donation

19:51.440 --> 19:53.818
to our boys.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.862
- Brilliant!

19:53.860 --> 19:55.862
- Sold out!

19:55.903 --> 19:57.113
I knew you could do it.

19:57.155 --> 19:58.781
- Good job!

19:57.155 --> 19:58.781
- Thank you.

19:58.823 --> 20:01.034
- Continue texting.

19:58.823 --> 20:01.034
- Oh, thank you.

20:02.660 --> 20:05.163
Oh, when the band gets here,

20:02.660 --> 20:05.163
grab Jerry and get them to do

20:05.204 --> 20:06.664
a sound check,

20:05.204 --> 20:06.664
make sure they're happy

20:06.706 --> 20:08.332
with the sound.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.332
Not just Jerry, because..

20:08.374 --> 20:09.667
Lacey? Where's my lacey?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.669
- 'Here.'

20:09.709 --> 20:11.669
- Come on, honey, keep up.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.337
I spotted the security guard,

20:11.711 --> 20:13.337
so I filled him in.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.255
Excellent. Cross that off the

20:13.379 --> 20:15.255
list. Servers are here?

20:15.297 --> 20:16.298
Got them all waiting

20:15.297 --> 20:16.298
in the back.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.466
Excellent. Whoa.

20:17.508 --> 20:18.592
Treat her gently there, boys.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.178
Betty's life was tough enough.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.142
- Hey, Paris.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.142
- Rory, I clocked in.

20:26.184 --> 20:27.601
- Cool.

20:26.184 --> 20:27.601
- They gave me this card.

20:27.643 --> 20:28.728
And it had my name on it.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.063
I shoved it in the clock thing

20:30.104 --> 20:31.105
and it made the punchy sound

20:31.147 --> 20:32.606
and I'm officially on the job.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.025
- Great!

20:32.648 --> 20:34.025
- And I'm prepared too.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.275
I was a little nervous

20:34.067 --> 20:35.275
last night

20:35.317 --> 20:36.861
about making small talk

20:35.317 --> 20:36.861
with co-workers

20:36.903 --> 20:39.238
so, I went to the video store

20:36.903 --> 20:39.238
and rented "Working Girl"

20:39.279 --> 20:40.865
and the first season

20:39.279 --> 20:40.865
of "Just Shoot Me."

20:40.907 --> 20:42.491
Got a couple

20:40.907 --> 20:42.491
of Wendie Malick bon mots

20:42.533 --> 20:43.868
that have already

20:42.533 --> 20:43.868
come in handy.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.452
- Very good. Welcome.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.452
- Thanks, boss.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.704
I'm gonna welcome

20:45.494 --> 20:46.704
the whole group here.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.039
No problem.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.709
Hello.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.709
You must be my servers.

20:51.751 --> 20:55.004
I'm Rory Gilmore.

20:51.751 --> 20:55.004
I'm running this little shindig.

20:55.046 --> 20:56.130
How are all of you today?

20:56.172 --> 20:57.215
- Good.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.215
- Great.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.465
You all come highly recommended

20:58.507 --> 21:00.134
by Glenda, our catering manager

21:00.176 --> 21:01.385
so I know you're all top notch.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.346
Yeah, super.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.346
Looks like a good group.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.099
Good group.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.308
Um, you know, um,

21:06.140 --> 21:08.308
you should probably

21:08.350 --> 21:09.685
be standing over

21:08.350 --> 21:09.685
with the others.

21:09.727 --> 21:13.522
Oh, right. I'm one of them.

21:09.727 --> 21:13.522
Got it. Sorry.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.274
So, it's going to be

21:13.564 --> 21:15.274
hard work tonight.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.276
We have a 100 people

21:15.315 --> 21:17.276
dining with us.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.319
But I want you to have fun too.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.948
We have your outfits

21:19.361 --> 21:21.948
on a rack over here.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.157
Your name should be on them.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.200
It's a good cause

21:24.242 --> 21:27.078
so let's get changed and go do.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.372
So, working hard

21:27.120 --> 21:30.372
or hardly working?

21:30.414 --> 21:33.626
Oh, my, oh, my. I love it!

21:33.667 --> 21:36.712
Hey. Thank you.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.712
So, where's Luke tonight?

21:36.754 --> 21:38.505
As we speak, he's off

21:36.754 --> 21:38.505
communing with nature.

21:38.547 --> 21:39.966
- Oh, good for him.

21:38.547 --> 21:39.966
- Yeah.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.885
Ooh, the ballerinas

21:40.007 --> 21:42.885
are doing "Swan Lake."

21:42.927 --> 21:44.095
That always makes me cry.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.763
Oh, Patty's

21:44.137 --> 21:45.763
packed it all in.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.890
"Baton twirling,

21:45.805 --> 21:47.890
a modeling exhibition."

21:47.932 --> 21:49.892
She's added

21:47.932 --> 21:49.892
a couple new features too.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.351
Yeah, what's krumping?

21:51.393 --> 21:54.188
Um, like hip-hop dance,

21:51.393 --> 21:54.188
I think, more herky-jerky.

21:54.230 --> 21:56.190
And what is

21:54.230 --> 21:56.190
<i>pubic</i> speaking?

21:56.232 --> 21:58.234
- I'm hoping it's a misprint.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.234
- I hope so too.

21:58.276 --> 22:00.569
Welcome, everybody

21:58.276 --> 22:00.569
to the 28th

22:00.611 --> 22:03.614
Annual Miss Patty's

22:00.611 --> 22:03.614
school grand recital.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.908
[applause]

22:05.950 --> 22:08.244
Thank you. We have a lot

22:05.950 --> 22:08.244
on the program tonight.

22:08.286 --> 22:10.412
So, without further ado please

22:08.286 --> 22:10.412
welcome

22:10.454 --> 22:13.582

22:10.454 --> 22:13.582

Yeah, and let the

23:12.266 --> 23:13.517
That the drums

23:12.266 --> 23:13.517
are a little loud.

23:13.559 --> 23:14.727
And it's a tad warm.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.020
Already had them

23:14.768 --> 23:16.020
adjust the AC.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.271
Any incoming choppers, radar?

23:17.313 --> 23:18.647
Choppers? No.

23:17.313 --> 23:18.647
What do you mean?

23:18.689 --> 23:19.815
Oh, that was a joke, Lacey.

23:19.857 --> 23:22.151
- Oh. Sorry.

23:19.857 --> 23:22.151
- You're a doll.

23:22.193 --> 23:24.362
Remember to have

23:22.193 --> 23:24.362
a little fun tonight too.

23:24.402 --> 23:27.698
Radar, I get it now.

23:24.402 --> 23:27.698
That was funny. I'll be back.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.161
- Appetizers?

23:30.659 --> 23:32.161
- Oh, thank you.

23:32.203 --> 23:34.121
You're welcome.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.413
So, how was that?

23:35.455 --> 23:36.957
Mm, fine, very good.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.292
I meant the transaction.

23:38.334 --> 23:39.377
I'd love a performance review.

23:39.417 --> 23:40.502
Come on, be my Dave Navarro.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.671
Um, you were fine.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.048
I'm gonna need more.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.591
It was T.S. Eliot

23:44.090 --> 23:45.591
who said "Criticism

23:45.632 --> 23:47.051
is as inevitable as breathing"

23:47.093 --> 23:48.510
and said that "We

23:47.093 --> 23:48.510
should be none the worse

23:48.552 --> 23:49.762
"for articulating

23:48.552 --> 23:49.762
what passes in our mind

23:49.803 --> 23:52.014
when we read a book,

23:49.803 --> 23:52.014
see a play, or"

23:52.056 --> 23:54.432
now I'm elaborating,

23:52.056 --> 23:54.432
"pass a cheddar and olive ball."

23:54.474 --> 23:55.809
- I need some feedback.

23:54.474 --> 23:55.809
- Really.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.728
You offered it to me

23:55.851 --> 23:57.728
well, and all seemed great

23:57.770 --> 23:59.397
and I don't wanna talk

23:57.770 --> 23:59.397
about this anymore.

23:59.437 --> 24:02.358
Good. Thank you.

23:59.437 --> 24:02.358
This has been a help.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.901
Welcome to the

24:02.400 --> 24:03.901
Hollywood canteen.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.485
Thank you.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.485
We're the Gilmores.

24:05.527 --> 24:07.821
- Richard, look at this place!

24:05.527 --> 24:07.821
- It's wonderful.

24:07.863 --> 24:11.075
Here is your table number.

24:07.863 --> 24:11.075
And take a pin, both of you.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.577
- Oh, thank you.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.577
- Yes, thank you.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.579
Oh, I love this song.

24:15.621 --> 24:18.207
And look at the band!

24:15.621 --> 24:18.207
It's the Andrew's Sisters.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.833
They've kept

24:18.249 --> 24:19.833
in pretty good shape.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.294
Hi, guys.

24:21.335 --> 24:22.878
Looks like you've got

24:21.335 --> 24:22.878
a hit on your hands.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.631
So far, so good.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.631
No one's dancing, though.

24:25.672 --> 24:27.841
It's early. You'll see plenty

24:25.672 --> 24:27.841
of dancing after dinner.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.343
You'll see

24:27.883 --> 24:29.343
some dancing right now.

24:29.385 --> 24:30.677
Richard, it's before dinner.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.305
There's no dancing

24:30.719 --> 24:32.305
during appetizers.

24:32.346 --> 24:34.472
Come on, let's show these

25:19.393 --> 25:22.355
- But you just repeated it.

25:22.396 --> 25:24.273
- Here's the woman of the hour.

25:22.396 --> 25:24.273
- Ah!

25:24.315 --> 25:25.732
How's the food, everybody?

25:25.774 --> 25:28.361
The macaroni and cheese,

25:25.774 --> 25:28.361
what an inspiration!

25:28.402 --> 25:31.697
Rory, please accept my profound

25:28.402 --> 25:31.697
thanks for serving food

25:31.738 --> 25:34.200
at a DAR event

25:31.738 --> 25:34.200
which is remarkably edible.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.826
Oh, Richard.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.826
We always have good food.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.328
Well, you have

25:35.868 --> 25:37.328
<i>fancy</i> good food.

25:37.370 --> 25:38.912

25:37.370 --> 25:38.912

25:38.954 --> 25:41.457
for the rest of my life,

25:38.954 --> 25:41.457
I will be a happy man.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.667
Rory, could I pull you

25:41.499 --> 25:43.667
away for just a second?

25:43.709 --> 25:46.170
Sure. Excuse me, everybody.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.422
She's so poised..

25:48.464 --> 25:50.216
...like you, Emily.

25:52.510 --> 25:55.262
A party's arrived. I'm looking,

25:52.510 --> 25:55.262
looking. They did not RSVP.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.639
- But they're expecting a table.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.639
- Oh, great! Where are they?

25:57.681 --> 25:59.599
By the war bonds table.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.599
It's Shira Huntzberger.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.394
'She waltzed in with

25:59.641 --> 26:01.394
a group of ladies in tow'

26:01.435 --> 26:03.561
'and made it very clear that she

26:01.435 --> 26:03.561
expected to be accommodated.'

26:03.603 --> 26:05.105
- Did she?

26:03.603 --> 26:05.105
- And not very nicely either.

26:05.147 --> 26:07.066
- Oh, what a shock.

26:05.147 --> 26:07.066
- But you know her, right?

26:07.107 --> 26:09.151
- She's your boyfriend's mother.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.151
- Yeah, yeah.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.903
- I know her.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.903
- I didn't mean to insult her.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.155
- She was just very abrupt.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.155
- It's okay. I'll take care.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.449
- Here's the seating chart.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.449
- Thanks.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.162
Hey, boss.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.162
It's interesting, you know.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.248
Karl Marx has come

26:20.204 --> 26:22.248
alive for me today.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.333
I never understood what

26:22.289 --> 26:24.333
he was yammering about before.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.419
And now, it just seems

26:24.375 --> 26:26.419
so obviously wrong

26:26.460 --> 26:28.837
that those who control capital

26:26.460 --> 26:28.837
should make their fortunes off

26:28.879 --> 26:31.382
the labor of the working class.

26:28.879 --> 26:31.382
What's wrong with you?

26:31.424 --> 26:33.259
- Shira Huntzberger is here.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.259
- Logan's mom?

26:33.300 --> 26:36.470
And she showed up

26:33.300 --> 26:36.470
with no warning, no RSVP

26:36.512 --> 26:38.431
'no donation to the cause

26:36.512 --> 26:38.431
that I know of.'

26:38.472 --> 26:41.141
Just sashayed in, expecting

26:38.472 --> 26:41.141
everyone to fall at her feet.

26:41.183 --> 26:42.726
- I hate that.

26:41.183 --> 26:42.726
- I hate<i> her.</i>

26:42.768 --> 26:46.646
Hate, strong,

26:42.768 --> 26:46.646
unadulterated, blind, ah!

26:46.688 --> 26:48.566
Wow. You're always so

26:46.688 --> 26:48.566
Desmond Tutuey.

26:48.606 --> 26:50.692
- This is refreshing.

26:48.606 --> 26:50.692
- I should tell her to leave.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.945
I should march up to her

26:50.734 --> 26:52.945
and tell her to grab

26:52.986 --> 26:55.489
those arrogance-dripping

26:52.986 --> 26:55.489
petulance-oozing

26:55.531 --> 26:57.699
surgically cosmeticized

26:55.531 --> 26:57.699
bims she brought along

26:57.741 --> 26:58.867
and hit the bricks.

26:58.909 --> 27:00.536
I bet they all have money too.

27:00.578 --> 27:02.620
Every one of

27:00.578 --> 27:02.620
those commodity fetishists.

27:02.662 --> 27:04.331
How can she expect a table?

27:04.373 --> 27:06.875
The tables are for the people

27:04.373 --> 27:06.875
who are polite enough

27:06.917 --> 27:09.545
to respond to an invitation

27:06.917 --> 27:09.545
in the proper manner.

27:09.587 --> 27:11.755
I bet you the Romanovs

27:09.587 --> 27:11.755
never RSVP'd either.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.591
They got theirs.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.591
Capitalist scum.

27:13.631 --> 27:15.633
- I hate her.

27:13.631 --> 27:15.633
- I hate the rich.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.803
A hard rain is gonna fall,

27:15.675 --> 27:17.803
you know what I'm saying?

27:17.844 --> 27:20.264
- I really hate her!

27:17.844 --> 27:20.264
- They should die.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.765
I should probably

27:20.306 --> 27:21.765
give her a table.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.934
- What?

27:21.807 --> 27:23.934
- Well, we have a spare table.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.685
We kept it open in case

27:23.976 --> 27:25.685
of something like this.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.896
- I should give it to her.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.896
- But she doesn't deserve it.

27:27.938 --> 27:30.732
I know, but this is business.

27:27.938 --> 27:30.732
It's not personal.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.776
- I should give her that table.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.776
- Fine.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.945
Whatever you think.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.945
You're the boss.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.447
Hey, boss, how much

27:34.987 --> 27:36.447
are you being paid

27:36.489 --> 27:38.656
in this job of yours?

27:44.913 --> 27:46.624
Mrs. Huntzberger.

27:46.664 --> 27:49.585
Rory, hi!

27:46.664 --> 27:49.585
What are you doing here?

27:49.627 --> 27:50.794
I'm running this event.

27:50.836 --> 27:51.878
I didn't know.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.172
Well, now you do.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.673
- I think I've been bad.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.673
- Oh, really? Why?

27:55.715 --> 27:57.551
I just showed up

27:55.715 --> 27:57.551
without any warning.

27:57.593 --> 27:59.470
I didn't think I could come,

27:57.593 --> 27:59.470
so I didn't call.

27:59.512 --> 28:02.389
Then I could, and the group

27:59.512 --> 28:02.389
and I just came down.

28:02.431 --> 28:03.681
It happens.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.683
That's what I told

28:03.723 --> 28:05.683
that other girl.

28:05.725 --> 28:06.893
She was a bit rude.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.646
Lacey? I'll talk to her.

28:08.686 --> 28:11.064
- Could you get us a table?

28:08.686 --> 28:11.064
- Of course.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.983
- It's not a problem?

28:11.106 --> 28:12.983
- Oh. Not at all.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.234
Come with me.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.234
It's all set up.

28:14.276 --> 28:15.528
Oh! You are the best.

28:15.569 --> 28:16.987
It's just my job.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.406
- So, no Logan?

28:17.029 --> 28:19.406
- Not tonight.

28:19.448 --> 28:21.408
- Not his thing?

28:19.448 --> 28:21.408
- Oh, you know Logan.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.869
- Here we are.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.869
- Thank you so much.

28:23.910 --> 28:25.371
And you look so pretty.

28:25.412 --> 28:26.664
So do you.

28:25.412 --> 28:26.664
Have a good time.

28:26.704 --> 28:28.040
I'm sure we will.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.881
You've created a superstar

28:34.380 --> 28:35.881
here tonight, Emily.

28:35.922 --> 28:38.217
- I hope you know that.

28:35.922 --> 28:38.217
- Well, yes, I do.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.469
There's already talk

28:38.258 --> 28:40.469
of giving her the AA.

28:40.511 --> 28:42.804
- An AA?

28:40.511 --> 28:42.804
- An Abigail Adams..

28:42.846 --> 28:44.931
For distinguished service

28:42.846 --> 28:44.931
above and beyond.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.266
She deserves it.

28:46.308 --> 28:48.185
She's made this

28:46.308 --> 28:48.185
a must-be-at event.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.437
I'm guessing that's

28:48.227 --> 28:50.437
what brought Shira here.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.606
Shira?

28:50.479 --> 28:52.606
Shira Huntzberger's here?

28:52.648 --> 28:54.400
Rumsfeld, himself,

28:52.648 --> 28:54.400
would probably call her

28:54.441 --> 28:57.236
and thank her for the donation

28:54.441 --> 28:57.236
she made on the way in.

28:57.277 --> 28:59.488
Hillbilly Armor

28:57.277 --> 28:59.488
will be a thing of the past.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.948
- Where is she sitting?

28:59.530 --> 29:01.948
- Up front, table by the band.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.950
- Oh, my God.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.950
- What?

29:03.992 --> 29:05.744
Oh, my God, excuse me.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.373
- Where's the seating chart?

29:07.246 --> 29:09.373
- What? Why?

29:09.415 --> 29:10.499
There's been a terrible mistake.

29:10.541 --> 29:11.625
What mistake?

29:11.667 --> 29:12.668
You sat Shira Huntzberger

29:12.710 --> 29:13.835
at the slush table.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.170
It was all that was available.

29:15.212 --> 29:17.047
The slush table

29:15.212 --> 29:17.047
is the loser table.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.840
But why would we have

29:17.089 --> 29:18.840
a loser table?

29:18.882 --> 29:20.467
It's for people

29:18.882 --> 29:20.467
who show up unannounced.

29:20.509 --> 29:21.968
She<i> was</i> unannounced.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.762
There's people,

29:22.010 --> 29:23.762
then there's the Huntzbergers.

29:23.803 --> 29:26.473
They cannot sit at that table.

29:23.803 --> 29:26.473
This needs to be rectified.

29:26.515 --> 29:28.225
I don't know what I can do.

29:26.515 --> 29:28.225
Every table's taken.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.851
I'll take care of it.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.851
Give me the seating chart.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.604
I'll find someone to bump.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.604
There's always someone to bump.

29:31.645 --> 29:33.313
Grandma. It doesn't seem fair

29:31.645 --> 29:33.313
to bump someone.

29:33.355 --> 29:34.565
It's not but if we don't find

29:34.607 --> 29:35.982
better seating for

29:34.607 --> 29:35.982
the Huntzbergers

29:36.024 --> 29:37.359
it'll be a major<i> faux pas</i>

29:37.401 --> 29:38.902
and it may be the only

29:37.401 --> 29:38.902
thing people remember

29:38.944 --> 29:40.571
from this

29:38.944 --> 29:40.571
otherwise wonderful event.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.364
- Wow.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.364
- Yes.

29:42.406 --> 29:44.491
Well, thank you for helping.

29:42.406 --> 29:44.491
And it's not the Huntzbergers.

29:44.533 --> 29:45.867
What?

29:45.909 --> 29:47.160
You keep saying

29:45.909 --> 29:47.160
"The Huntzbergers."

29:47.202 --> 29:48.245
It's only Shira

29:47.202 --> 29:48.245
and some friends.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.288
And Mitchum.

29:49.329 --> 29:50.456
- No.

29:49.329 --> 29:50.456
- Yes.

29:50.497 --> 29:53.667
He's right over there.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.085
The Betterton's, perfect!

29:55.127 --> 29:57.045
We'll bump Constance Betterton.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.045
It's a win, win.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.512
- Paris?

30:03.302 --> 30:05.512
- I'm just on my break.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.222
You're white as a sheet.

30:07.264 --> 30:09.767
I'm having trouble breathing.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.268
You're having a panic attack.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.852
- I think so.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.852
- Don't worry.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.271
I have these all the time.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.855
- What do I do?

30:14.313 --> 30:15.855
- Well, it depends.

30:15.897 --> 30:17.149
There are different kinds,

30:15.897 --> 30:17.149
does it feel like

30:17.190 --> 30:18.317
an elephant

30:17.190 --> 30:18.317
is sitting on your chest?

30:18.358 --> 30:19.610
No.

30:19.652 --> 30:20.944
Does your chest feel

30:19.652 --> 30:20.944
like an over-inflated

30:20.986 --> 30:22.404
balloon with a slow leak?

30:22.446 --> 30:23.739
Not really.

30:23.781 --> 30:25.198
Sharp needles,

30:23.781 --> 30:25.198
intermittently poking

30:25.240 --> 30:26.241
into your left ventricle?

30:26.283 --> 30:27.493
I don't know from ventricles

30:27.534 --> 30:29.161
but there is a needle thing.

30:29.202 --> 30:31.497
You need Diazepam.

30:29.202 --> 30:31.497
50, no, 100 milligrams.

30:31.538 --> 30:33.039
- I'll get my purse.

30:31.538 --> 30:33.039
- No, wait.

30:33.081 --> 30:34.667
I don't want any Diazepam.

30:34.708 --> 30:37.461
Well, what do you want?

30:34.708 --> 30:37.461
Fluoxetine, Protriptyline?

30:37.503 --> 30:39.129
I have others floating

30:37.503 --> 30:39.129
around the bottom of my purse.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.381
I have no idea what they are,

30:39.171 --> 30:41.381
but popping a few can't hurt.

30:41.423 --> 30:43.049
Pretty hot grab bag.

30:43.091 --> 30:47.137
These people, those people,

30:43.091 --> 30:47.137
they didn't even RSVP.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.806
That's not right.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.806
This is for our boys.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.432
They need to make a donation.

30:50.474 --> 30:51.850
Tough night for you, huh?

30:51.891 --> 30:53.852
Shira's one thing.

30:51.891 --> 30:53.852
I can deal with her.

30:53.893 --> 30:55.729
But Mitchum?

30:55.771 --> 30:58.231
I can't see him.

30:55.771 --> 30:58.231
I can't face him.

30:58.273 --> 31:01.193
It's too much, after what

30:58.273 --> 31:01.193
he did, what he said to me.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.736
What did he say to you?

31:02.778 --> 31:04.446
If it weren't for him,

31:02.778 --> 31:04.446
I wouldn't have--

31:04.488 --> 31:06.406
You wouldn't have what?

31:06.448 --> 31:09.201
- 'Rory?'

31:06.448 --> 31:09.201
- Nothing, nothing.

31:09.242 --> 31:11.036
He's just..

31:11.077 --> 31:12.705
...they're just not

31:11.077 --> 31:12.705
the nicest people.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.998
Well, the rich never are,

31:12.746 --> 31:14.998
because they don't have to be.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.042
When you control the means

31:15.040 --> 31:17.042
of production it reduces

31:17.083 --> 31:19.712
the incentive to humanize

31:17.083 --> 31:19.712
workers. Capitalist system--

31:19.753 --> 31:21.129
You know, I haven't

31:19.753 --> 31:21.129
eaten all day.

31:21.171 --> 31:23.465
I think I should eat.

31:21.171 --> 31:23.465
That's my problem.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.509
Sure, boss, go eat.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.845
There's probably somewhere

31:25.551 --> 31:27.845
else where you eat, right?

31:27.886 --> 31:29.638
Special room.

31:31.598 --> 31:32.891
[instrumental music]

31:42.942 --> 31:45.571
It's just so damn beautiful.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.698
I know, honey.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.290
[applause]

31:57.332 --> 31:59.710
The Patty Ballerinas, everybody.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.799
Now, I would like to introduce

32:02.421 --> 32:05.799
a special new segment

32:05.841 --> 32:08.009
of my annual recital entitled

32:08.051 --> 32:10.220
"It was 20 years ago today."

32:10.262 --> 32:12.972
One of our local townsmen

32:10.262 --> 32:12.972
is going to re-create an act

32:13.014 --> 32:16.560
that he performed on this

32:13.014 --> 32:16.560
very stage 20 years ago.

32:16.602 --> 32:19.479
This young man was

32:16.602 --> 32:19.479
a talented pupil of mine.

32:19.521 --> 32:22.733
Wonderful dancing skills

32:19.521 --> 32:22.733
and a genius tumbler.

32:22.775 --> 32:25.944
He once did 98 somersaults

32:22.775 --> 32:25.944
in a row without throwing up.

32:25.985 --> 32:29.322
'But that's nothing compared

32:25.985 --> 32:29.322
with his talent for mime.'

32:29.364 --> 32:32.367
Here, to present a piece

32:29.364 --> 32:32.367
of his own creation

32:32.409 --> 32:35.579
entitled "The Journey of Man"

32:35.621 --> 32:38.540
exactly as he performed

32:35.621 --> 32:38.540
it 20 years ago

32:38.582 --> 32:40.709
is...Kirk!

32:46.047 --> 32:48.717
It's moments like these

32:46.047 --> 32:48.717
that make life worth living.

32:48.759 --> 32:50.677
[dramatic music]

33:01.313 --> 33:03.398
- Ew.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.358
[chanting]

33:11.156 --> 33:12.491
- Ew!

33:18.997 --> 33:22.041
So, it's the birth

33:18.997 --> 33:22.041
of Lucille Ball?

33:32.552 --> 33:34.471
[music continues]

33:35.889 --> 33:38.851
Oh, he's a parent now,

33:35.889 --> 33:38.851
I get that.

33:38.892 --> 33:41.227
He's moving along

33:38.892 --> 33:41.227
at a nice clip.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.320
I'll be right back.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.238
I'll catch you up

33:50.362 --> 33:52.238
when you return.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.452
[knock on door]

34:06.294 --> 34:08.087
Hey, Grizzly Adams.

34:08.129 --> 34:09.589
Why are you back?

34:08.129 --> 34:09.589
The woods closed or something?

34:09.631 --> 34:12.634
No, they weren't closed.

34:09.631 --> 34:12.634
I was..

34:12.676 --> 34:15.554
...I don't know.

34:12.676 --> 34:15.554
It's...what it is.

34:15.595 --> 34:18.891
- Nature.

34:15.595 --> 34:18.891
- Nature? Nature is..

34:18.932 --> 34:23.020
You know, it's there, I saw

34:18.932 --> 34:23.020
it, trees, leaves, whatever.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.980
Okay. That's your second answer

34:23.061 --> 34:24.980
in the form of a<i> haiku.</i>

34:25.022 --> 34:26.815
Let's get beyond that.

34:25.022 --> 34:26.815
Why are you back?

34:26.857 --> 34:29.735
Because I felt like coming back.

34:26.857 --> 34:29.735
I can't do what I wanna do?

34:29.776 --> 34:31.361
- Of course you can.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.361
- Good.

34:31.403 --> 34:32.696
But camping is something

34:31.403 --> 34:32.696
you wanna do.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.322
No, it's what

34:32.738 --> 34:34.322
you wanted me to do.

34:34.364 --> 34:35.741
When did you

34:34.364 --> 34:35.741
turn against camping?

34:35.782 --> 34:38.201
I didn't

34:35.782 --> 34:38.201
turn against camping.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.620
I'm just trying

34:38.243 --> 34:40.620
to understand

34:40.662 --> 34:42.706
why you were trying

34:40.662 --> 34:42.706
to get rid of me tonight.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.250
- I wasn't doing that.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.250
- You sent me off to the woods.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.210
What if I don't wanna

34:45.291 --> 34:47.210
go off to the woods?

34:47.252 --> 34:48.503
You always wanna

34:47.252 --> 34:48.503
go to the woods.

34:48.545 --> 34:49.588
I don't like going to the woods

34:49.629 --> 34:50.630
when I'm being banished to them.

34:50.672 --> 34:51.882
No one is banishing you.

34:51.924 --> 34:53.216
It felt like it.

34:54.843 --> 34:57.136
Well, then,

34:54.843 --> 34:57.136
that's my fault.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.598
[sighs]

34:57.178 --> 34:59.598
Look.

34:59.639 --> 35:02.100
I like doing things with you.

35:02.141 --> 35:03.560
Surprised I have

35:02.141 --> 35:03.560
to tell you that.

35:03.602 --> 35:04.770
You don't have

35:03.602 --> 35:04.770
to tell me that.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.688
I like going

35:04.811 --> 35:06.688
shopping with you.

35:06.730 --> 35:10.358
I like having dinner

35:06.730 --> 35:10.358
with Sookie and Jackson.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.945
The actual shopping

35:10.400 --> 35:12.945
seems a little pointless

35:12.986 --> 35:16.073
and Sookie's kids drive me up

35:12.986 --> 35:16.073
a wall but you're there.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.450
- 'And I like hanging with you.'

35:16.114 --> 35:18.450
- I know that.

35:18.491 --> 35:21.369
And I could have been

35:18.491 --> 35:21.369
fun at this recital.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.622
I mean, you're probably sitting

35:21.411 --> 35:23.622
there mocking most of it.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.124
- I can mock stuff.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.124
- You're a great mocker.

35:26.165 --> 35:28.460
I was only thinking of you

35:26.165 --> 35:28.460
when I mentioned the camping.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.754
You haven't been camping

35:28.501 --> 35:30.754
since we got together

35:30.796 --> 35:32.380
and I was feeling

35:30.796 --> 35:32.380
weird about that.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.591
You should do

35:32.422 --> 35:34.591
the things you like.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.175
I<i> do</i> do the things I like.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.469
Well, I wasn't

35:36.217 --> 35:37.469
getting rid of you.

35:37.510 --> 35:38.762
I want you to do whatever

35:38.804 --> 35:40.430
you wanna do with me.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.307
I know that sounded dirty.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.307
And dirty things count.

35:42.348 --> 35:44.810
But I didn't mean

35:42.348 --> 35:44.810
the dirty things.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.312
You and me can hang

35:44.851 --> 35:47.312
whenever, wherever.

35:47.353 --> 35:49.230
Yeah, well,

35:47.353 --> 35:49.230
maybe I'm being sensitive.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.942
I really wasn't

35:49.272 --> 35:51.942
getting rid of you.

35:51.984 --> 35:54.486
I mean, I'm not dying

35:51.984 --> 35:54.486
to see Baton Twirling.

35:54.527 --> 35:55.988
I'm happy to be

35:54.527 --> 35:55.988
with a man who isn't.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.405
- Was there Baton Twirling?

35:56.029 --> 35:57.405
- Oh, yes.

35:57.447 --> 35:59.198
And it was no fun.

35:57.447 --> 35:59.198
She didn't drop it once.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.911
You wanna come back

36:00.659 --> 36:02.911
to the recital with me?

36:02.953 --> 36:05.163
Kirk is doing something

36:02.953 --> 36:05.163
strange and disturbing.

36:05.204 --> 36:08.125
No, I think I might

36:05.204 --> 36:08.125
go back out camping.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.459
Wouldn't mind

36:08.166 --> 36:09.459
doing some fishing.

36:09.501 --> 36:10.877
- Good.

36:09.501 --> 36:10.877
- Yeah.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.254
- Good.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.254
- Okay.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.225

36:23.640 --> 36:26.225

36:28.061 --> 36:30.772
Well, it's gonna happen

36:28.061 --> 36:30.772
to all of us one day.

36:34.651 --> 36:36.611
Just not so spazzy.

what happened

37:50.518 --> 37:51.770
with all of that?

37:51.811 --> 37:53.230
All of what?

37:53.271 --> 37:55.690
Uh, that paper

37:53.271 --> 37:55.690
of yours in Stanford.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.609
Something, apparently,

37:55.732 --> 37:57.609
got blown out of proportion.

37:57.650 --> 37:58.902
There was

37:57.650 --> 37:58.902
some misunderstanding.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.904
Oh, it was nothing much.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.904
She's a great kid.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.447
She is. And a great journalist.

38:02.488 --> 38:05.825
I've read things

38:02.488 --> 38:05.825
she's written. She's a talent.

38:05.867 --> 38:09.412
- Maybe.

38:05.867 --> 38:09.412
- What do you mean "maybe"?

38:09.454 --> 38:11.873
Well, I worked with her,

38:09.454 --> 38:11.873
Richard. I read her stuff too.

38:11.915 --> 38:12.999
- Meaning?

38:11.915 --> 38:12.999
- I've read great.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.584
I know what great is.

38:14.626 --> 38:17.045
When I said great, I didn't

38:14.626 --> 38:17.045
mean she was Ben Bradley yet

38:17.087 --> 38:19.881
but she could be.

38:19.923 --> 38:22.467
Anything's possible.

38:22.508 --> 38:24.844
What exactly happened

38:22.508 --> 38:24.844
at that paper, Mitchum?

38:24.886 --> 38:27.013
It didn't work out, Richard.

38:24.886 --> 38:27.013
It was just one of those things.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.681
She's better off

38:27.055 --> 38:28.681
for what I did.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.308
And what exactly

38:28.723 --> 38:30.308
did you do?

38:30.349 --> 38:31.893
Nothing you

38:30.349 --> 38:31.893
wouldn't have done.

38:31.935 --> 38:34.437
- Oh, and what was that?

38:31.935 --> 38:34.437
- You're in the business world.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.397
- You have employees, yes?

38:34.479 --> 38:36.397
- Of course.

38:36.439 --> 38:39.067
Say, you got a guy working in

38:36.439 --> 38:39.067
your office, you brought him in.

38:39.109 --> 38:42.361
Nice guy, everybody loves him

38:39.109 --> 38:42.361
but he just doesn't have it.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.656
He's a drain on the company.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.656
What are you gonna do?

38:44.697 --> 38:47.159
My granddaughter was not

38:44.697 --> 38:47.159
a drain on your company.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.244
My point is, that

38:47.200 --> 38:49.244
I wasn't going to put her

38:49.286 --> 38:51.621
in a position to become a drain.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.832
Now, Richard, really,

38:51.663 --> 38:53.832
we should get back out there.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.583
- What did you say to her?

38:53.873 --> 38:55.583
- Richard--

38:55.625 --> 38:56.876
What did you say

38:55.625 --> 38:56.876
to her, Mitchum?

38:56.918 --> 38:58.128
I did what I do with everyone.

38:58.170 --> 38:59.545
I called it like I saw it.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.089
I was honest with her.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.089
I don't pussyfoot.

39:01.131 --> 39:03.508
- You know that.

39:01.131 --> 39:03.508
- You crushed her.

39:03.549 --> 39:06.385
And if she's got what it takes,

39:03.549 --> 39:06.385
she'll bounce back.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.054
No one's ever

39:06.427 --> 39:08.054
criticized you, Richard

39:08.096 --> 39:10.265
reprimanded you, critiqued you?

39:08.096 --> 39:10.265
I find that hard to believe.

39:10.307 --> 39:12.433
- This is not about me.

39:10.307 --> 39:12.433
- She was in over her head.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.644
- She lacked maturity.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.644
- She's not even 21!

39:14.686 --> 39:17.063
Look, just blame me, okay?

39:17.105 --> 39:19.607
I felt bad that she had to sit

39:17.105 --> 39:19.607
through that disastrous dinner

39:19.649 --> 39:22.152
'with Shira and pop

39:19.649 --> 39:22.152

39:22.194 --> 39:23.778
and how she

39:22.194 --> 39:23.778
can't become a Huntzberger.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.404
I don't care

39:23.820 --> 39:25.404
about any of that.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.532
So, I gave her a shot,

39:25.446 --> 39:27.532
and she wasn't up to it.

39:27.573 --> 39:28.741
You crushed that girl!

39:28.783 --> 39:30.827
I did what I do.

40:07.322 --> 40:08.573
she's good enough.

40:08.614 --> 40:10.575
He told her

40:08.614 --> 40:10.575
that she didn't have it.

40:10.616 --> 40:11.951
And you know she does!

40:10.616 --> 40:11.951
I know she does!

40:11.993 --> 40:13.328
Of course, she does.

40:13.370 --> 40:14.954
I can't stay in this room

40:13.370 --> 40:14.954
with these people.

40:14.996 --> 40:16.706
Richard, go outside,

40:14.996 --> 40:16.706
get some air.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.375
- We should go home.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.375
- I'll catch up with you.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.625
- Go outside.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.625
- Yeah, yeah.

40:26.132 --> 40:28.467
♪ For you and me ♪

40:30.178 --> 40:35.641

40:39.896 --> 40:42.315
- Emily!

40:39.896 --> 40:42.315
- Hello, Shira.

40:42.357 --> 40:44.650
I'm here to rescue you. I've got

40:42.357 --> 40:44.650
a table for you and Mitchum.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.945
- Right in the center.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.945
- Oh, bless you, Emily.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.780
- I'm undeserving.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.780
- Nonsense.

40:48.821 --> 40:51.074
It was a terrible mistake

40:48.821 --> 40:51.074
and it must be rectified.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.575
Aren't they amazing?

40:52.617 --> 40:54.827
The whole combo

40:52.617 --> 40:54.827
is amazing. Follow me.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.204
Me, I love the Beatles.

40:56.246 --> 40:57.997
Mitchum took me to see

40:56.246 --> 40:57.997
Paul McCartney last year

40:58.039 --> 41:01.500
and I almost died. Come on.

41:01.542 --> 41:04.087
So, Richard tells me

41:01.542 --> 41:04.087
we have a little problem.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.422
Really? With what?

41:05.463 --> 41:07.757
With the kids, Logan, Rory.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.884
I understand you're not

41:07.799 --> 41:09.884
exactly thrilled with the match

41:09.926 --> 41:11.761
that you let that be known

41:09.926 --> 41:11.761
to Rory at the dinner

41:11.803 --> 41:13.179
she had at your house.

41:13.221 --> 41:15.765
Oh, well, I wouldn't

41:13.221 --> 41:15.765
say "not thrilled."

41:15.807 --> 41:16.975
Then what would you say?

41:17.016 --> 41:18.726
Oh, Emily, this is a party.

41:18.768 --> 41:20.437
I'm just curious.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.939
This may not be

41:20.478 --> 41:22.939
the time and place, Emily.

41:22.981 --> 41:25.524
Hello, you two,

41:22.981 --> 41:25.524
drop by our table later.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.277
Let's make it

41:25.566 --> 41:27.277
the time and place.

41:27.319 --> 41:29.195
Consider the discrepancies,

41:27.319 --> 41:29.195
Emily.

41:29.237 --> 41:30.529
Well, that's what's

41:29.237 --> 41:30.529
confusing me.

41:30.571 --> 41:31.781
They both come

41:30.571 --> 41:31.781
from good families.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.450
They both have good values.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.368
Money doesn't seem to be

41:33.491 --> 41:35.368
an issue. We all have money.

41:35.410 --> 41:36.828
Frankly, Emily,

41:35.410 --> 41:36.828
there's your money.

41:36.869 --> 41:38.496
- Then there's our money.

41:36.869 --> 41:38.496
- Oh?

41:38.537 --> 41:40.498
And our family has

41:38.537 --> 41:40.498
a lot of responsibilities

41:40.539 --> 41:42.917
that come with that,

41:40.539 --> 41:42.917
an image to maintain.

41:42.959 --> 41:45.295
Ah, yes! Well, let me

41:42.959 --> 41:45.295
tell you this, Shira.

41:45.337 --> 41:46.879
We are just as good as you are.

41:46.921 --> 41:48.506
You don't think Rory

41:46.921 --> 41:48.506
is good enough for your son

41:48.547 --> 41:50.925
as if we don't know

41:48.547 --> 41:50.925
Logan's reputation, we do.

41:50.967 --> 41:52.593
But he is welcome

41:50.967 --> 41:52.593
in our home anytime

41:52.635 --> 41:54.553
and you should extend

41:52.635 --> 41:54.553
the same courtesy to Rory.

41:54.595 --> 41:57.556
- Emily--

41:54.595 --> 41:57.556
- Let's talk about your money.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.976
You were a two-bit

41:57.598 --> 41:59.976
gold digger, fresh off

42:00.018 --> 42:01.686
the bus from Hicksville

42:00.018 --> 42:01.686
when you met Mitchum

42:01.727 --> 42:04.147
at whatever bar

42:01.727 --> 42:04.147
you happened to stumble into.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.274
And what made Mitchum

42:04.189 --> 42:06.274
decide to choose you to marry

42:06.316 --> 42:08.109
amongst the pack of women

42:06.316 --> 42:08.109
he was bedding at the time

42:08.151 --> 42:11.029
I'll never know. But hats off

42:08.151 --> 42:11.029
to you for bagging him.

42:11.070 --> 42:13.531
He's still a playboy, you know?

42:11.070 --> 42:13.531
Well, of course, you know.

42:13.572 --> 42:15.158
That would explain why

42:13.572 --> 42:15.158
your weight goes up and down

42:15.200 --> 42:16.575
30 pounds every other month.

42:16.617 --> 42:18.328
But that's your cross to bear.

42:18.370 --> 42:21.789
But these are ugly realities.

42:18.370 --> 42:21.789
No one needs to talk about them.

42:21.831 --> 42:24.667
Those kids are staying together

42:21.831 --> 42:24.667
for as long as they like.

42:24.709 --> 42:27.420
You won't stop them.

42:24.709 --> 42:27.420
Now, enjoy the event.

42:29.297 --> 42:30.882
Diane, hello.

42:52.237 --> 42:55.407
Thank you and I'd like

42:52.237 --> 42:55.407
to take this moment to thank

42:55.448 --> 42:58.659
'some others for the outstanding

42:55.448 --> 42:58.659
success this evening.'

42:58.701 --> 43:01.787
'To Lacey Boscombe,

42:58.701 --> 43:01.787
my right hand, my girl Friday.'

43:01.829 --> 43:03.873
'I could not have

43:01.829 --> 43:03.873
done it without you.'

43:03.915 --> 43:07.335
'To Glenda, Lance, the entire

43:03.915 --> 43:07.335
serving crew, thank you.'

43:07.377 --> 43:10.380
'To the kind people at KBC

43:07.377 --> 43:10.380
audios who generously donated..'
