00:26.640 --> 00:30.974
Michael, uh, you remember me
from the last time you and I talked?

00:31.044 --> 00:32.909
About a week ago?

00:32.979 --> 00:36.039
You see this camera?
You're going to have to say "yes"...

00:36.116 --> 00:38.277
so that camera can take down
everything you say.

00:38.352 --> 00:42.379
Because that camera can't take down
something when you shake your head.

00:42.456 --> 00:46.256
Can you say "yes" for us?
Let me hear you say, "yes." "Yes."

00:46.326 --> 00:49.523
That's pretty good. How about a
little bit louder than that? "Yes."

00:49.596 --> 00:53.726
And we talked about what happened
on the 13th of May?

00:53.800 --> 00:56.132
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

00:56.203 --> 01:02.039
Now, Michael, do you know what it is to,
uh-to tell the truth about things?

01:02.843 --> 01:05.242
You're gonna have to say "yes."
You can't shake your head. "Yes."

01:05.278 --> 01:10.341
Okay. What does it mean when you
have to tell the truth about things?

01:11.485 --> 01:13.919
- Don't lie.
- Don't lie. That's right.

01:13.987 --> 01:17.286
And do you know what happens
to people who lie?

01:18.759 --> 01:19.851
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

01:19.926 --> 01:21.985
- What happens to them?
- They get hurt.

01:22.062 --> 01:24.087
They get hurt.

01:41.648 --> 01:44.412
Yes, the big story on Action News tonight
is the effort to evict MOVE...

01:44.484 --> 01:47.419
from its house
on the 6200 block of Osage Avenue.

01:47.487 --> 01:49.580
The effort has turned into a disaster.

01:49.656 --> 01:54.025
The fire is now five-alarm,
still raging out of control as you can see.

01:54.094 --> 01:57.427
An unknown number of heavily-armed
MOVE members continue at large,

01:57.497 --> 01:59.431
possibly roaming the alleyways.

01:59.499 --> 02:03.731
Going in, everybody knew
that MOVE would resist anything.

02:03.804 --> 02:07.501
While the police will say that
they come here to arrest people,

02:07.574 --> 02:09.098
we have done nothing wrong.

02:09.175 --> 02:11.770
We do not want policemen killed.
We do not want people in the house killed.

02:11.845 --> 02:14.541
Fellow officer, James Ramp,
was killed seven years ago.

02:14.614 --> 02:16.104
They will never forget that.

02:16.750 --> 02:19.947
Okay. This is unconfirmed.
We've got to emphasize this is unconfirmed.

02:20.020 --> 02:22.750
But Channel 10 technician,
Fran Hardy reports-

02:22.823 --> 02:25.951
An incendiary device
was dropped out of that helicopter.

02:26.026 --> 02:28.221
Nobody around here has ever
seen anything like this.

02:28.929 --> 02:33.559
We expect that maybe 60, perhaps more,
homes have gone up in flames.

02:33.633 --> 02:37.535
I stand fully accountable
for the actions that took place tonight.

02:38.138 --> 02:43.371
How did an attempt to arrest MOVE members
become an inferno that killed 11 people...

02:43.443 --> 02:45.240
and destroyed 61 homes?

02:45.312 --> 02:50.249
You can call the group reactionists,
revolutionaries, terrorists.

02:50.317 --> 02:55.755
That was a decision...
to let the fire burn.

03:28.889 --> 03:33.417
On May 13, 1985,

03:33.493 --> 03:36.929
years of conflict between
the city of Philadelphia...

03:36.997 --> 03:40.228
and a small, urban group
known as MOVE...

03:40.300 --> 03:44.168
ended in a violent,
daylong encounter...

03:44.237 --> 03:47.297
between the groups' members
and the Philadelphia police.

03:48.775 --> 03:54.475
It was one of the most devastating days
in the modern history of the city.

03:55.682 --> 03:58.674
Before we call the first witness...

03:58.752 --> 04:01.414
I want to tell you
about this special commission.

04:02.656 --> 04:06.888
We are men and women,
black and white,

04:06.960 --> 04:09.588
guided by our own attitudes
and beliefs.

04:11.298 --> 04:15.325
What we hope to accomplish
is to begin healing the wounds...

04:15.402 --> 04:20.964
caused by the failure to resolve
conflicting lifestyles in a peaceful way.

04:38.858 --> 04:41.918
Six, five, four, three...

04:43.863 --> 04:49.096
This is MOVE, the people in an organization
that admits to being totally revolutionary.

04:49.169 --> 04:51.307
For the past four years,
they have lived in the

04:51.320 --> 04:53.469
Powelton Village area
of West Philadelphia,

04:53.540 --> 04:56.634
often running into conflicts with police.

04:56.710 --> 04:59.133
Their personal appearance
has brought stares and

04:59.146 --> 05:01.579
some expressions of disapproval
from the community.

05:01.648 --> 05:04.446
But it what they do that counts,
not how they look.

05:04.517 --> 05:08.544
In everything from work habits to
child raising, MOVE is revolutionary.

05:08.622 --> 05:11.352
Uh, I was indoctrinated with a philosophy
in the Panthers...

05:11.424 --> 05:15.383
that revolution only meant picking up a
gun and going out and murdering somebody.

05:15.462 --> 05:19.728
I never thought that revolution
consisted of revolutionizing myself...

05:19.799 --> 05:22.791
to get away from the things
that caused me to wanna revolt.

05:24.037 --> 05:28.201
MOVE does not believe in technology.
They use a wood-burning stove for heat,

05:28.274 --> 05:30.139
and they have no electricity.

05:30.210 --> 05:33.145
But they do have cars,
and they have a telephone. Why?

05:33.213 --> 05:37.479
All the answers are in the guidelines,
their bible left by John Africa.

05:39.853 --> 05:45.587
Miss Sims, can you describe for me
what the philosophy of MOVE was?

05:45.659 --> 05:48.514
What did John Africa
teach with regard to the

05:48.527 --> 05:51.393
society in which you
found yourself living?

05:51.464 --> 05:53.557
You're asking what was being taught?

05:53.633 --> 05:54.622
Yes, ma'am.

05:54.701 --> 05:58.660
Okay. Um, the absolute truth.

06:00.040 --> 06:03.703
We were being taught
about this system.

06:04.644 --> 06:06.908
The corruption in this system.

06:08.581 --> 06:14.042
But mainly, it was...
just the absolute truth.

06:14.120 --> 06:20.787
What John Africa did was...
expose the lie in the system.

06:20.860 --> 06:22.350
Uncover it.

06:22.429 --> 06:25.296
Could you describe what you mean
by the word "the system", please?

06:25.365 --> 06:27.299
The system.
The establishment. You.

06:31.204 --> 06:33.900
Philadelphia is a tortured city.

06:33.973 --> 06:36.533
Trash piles up at the curbline.

06:36.609 --> 06:39.203
Kids are afraid to walk to school.

06:39.279 --> 06:42.043
Abandoned homes
pockmark the ghetto.

06:42.115 --> 06:46.711
Philadelphia needs a strong man
for a tough job.

06:46.786 --> 06:49.550
Philadelphia needs
Frank Rizzo as mayor.

06:51.257 --> 06:54.920
A small, vocal minority among us...

06:54.994 --> 06:59.158
seeks to destroy
the heritage of 1776.

06:59.232 --> 07:05.193
We must be ever-vigilant that this minority
does not impose its philosophy...

07:05.271 --> 07:08.604
on the unwilling majority of Americans.

07:10.510 --> 07:14.412
In their vigilant effort to maintain
close contact with mother Earth,

07:14.481 --> 07:18.679
the MOVE members are breaking up the cement
of the sidewalk around their property.

07:24.324 --> 07:26.758
Yeah, life.

07:27.761 --> 07:31.060
But you are not animals. I mean...

07:31.131 --> 07:32.826
- Why not?
- I don't want to be personal.

07:32.899 --> 07:35.163
- Wait a minute. Why not?
- Yes, we are.

07:35.235 --> 07:39.899
We are animals, because our reference is no
different than the reference of animals.

07:39.973 --> 07:41.693
There's only one reference,
and that's life.

07:41.708 --> 07:45.610
That's what MOVE is about.
Life. Truth. That's our religion.

07:50.016 --> 07:53.679
We see John Africa in the same way
that people saw Jesus Christ...

07:53.753 --> 07:58.850
because of his carpentry, because of his
simple way of living, and so forth.

07:58.925 --> 08:04.659
Now, we know that John Africa is a man
who can explain Jesus Christ.

08:07.700 --> 08:12.194
When Reverend Audrey Bronson wants to
practice her religion, nobody beats her up.

08:13.506 --> 08:18.341
But when MOVE wanted to practice their
religion, people started talking about, uh,

08:18.411 --> 08:21.073
"it's not done that way."

08:21.147 --> 08:27.108
There are Catholics and Methodists,
evangelists, theologians, you name it.

08:27.187 --> 08:29.747
We were the religion of life.

08:29.823 --> 08:34.385
Where is it written that we could not
have a religion of our own?

08:34.460 --> 08:37.429
Your brother, Vincent Leapheart
was John Africa, is that correct?

08:37.496 --> 08:42.126
My brother, Vincent Leapheart,
was my brother.

08:42.202 --> 08:45.899
John Africa was the founder
of the MOVE organization.

08:45.972 --> 08:48.668
And they were one and the same?

08:48.741 --> 08:51.904
I said my brother was my brother.

08:51.978 --> 08:56.312
And I said John Africa was
the founder of the MOVE organization.

08:56.382 --> 09:00.250
John-Vincent Leapheart
is my brother.

09:07.827 --> 09:12.059
When Michael was about two years of age,
he was taken by his mother...

09:12.131 --> 09:17.091
to a residence occupied by members
of an organization called MOVE.

09:17.170 --> 09:20.606
And Michael was subsequently
given the name of Birdie Africa.

09:22.141 --> 09:25.406
Michael Ward was, of course,
no more a member of MOVE...

09:25.478 --> 09:29.073
than a child of Republican
or Democratic parents...

09:29.148 --> 09:31.616
would be styled by
a particular party label.

09:31.684 --> 09:35.245
He was throughout,
an absolutely innocent,

09:35.321 --> 09:39.690
guiltless, and under the circumstances,
vulnerable child and youngster.

10:26.306 --> 10:31.300
Now, when you go to school
and you embrace that education,

10:31.377 --> 10:35.279
the very first thing you are
taught in school is separation...

10:35.348 --> 10:38.943
is categorization,
alienation, conflict.

10:39.018 --> 10:41.919
You're taught black, white,
blue, green.

10:41.988 --> 10:46.118
Up, down, back, forth.
Taught, uh, Protestant, Catholic.

10:46.192 --> 10:49.684
Taught Yale, Harvard.
Conflict. War.

10:49.762 --> 10:55.029
You know, if a child does not know
that he is black and I am white,

10:55.101 --> 10:56.864
if he is not taught
that categorization,

10:56.936 --> 10:58.528
if he is not taught
that separation,

10:58.604 --> 11:01.801
In the place of that,
all he can gravitate to,

11:01.874 --> 11:04.968
all he can know is harmony,
is unity, is love.

11:22.996 --> 11:24.987
Life! Life!

11:26.175 --> 11:28.175
- Did you like raw food?
- Some of it.

11:28.201 --> 11:31.466
Some of it?
What did you like particularly?

11:32.438 --> 11:35.874
Watermelon, mangoes...

11:35.942 --> 11:38.240
and sweet potatoes and onions.

11:38.311 --> 11:41.109
And onions.
Did you all eat any meat at all?

11:41.180 --> 11:43.375
Only one time
we ate raw chicken.

11:44.550 --> 11:46.586
Why would the adults eat
cooked food and the

11:46.599 --> 11:48.646
children not eat cooked food?
Do you know?

11:48.721 --> 11:50.985
They said they wasn't
used to raw food.

11:51.057 --> 11:54.515
They weren't used to raw food
and the children were used to raw food.

12:10.943 --> 12:14.344
Were you all ever punished
for taking the food or anything?

12:16.115 --> 12:18.675
Yeah. Did they punish you
when you...

12:18.751 --> 12:21.311
- They had meetings on us.
- They had meetings?

12:21.387 --> 12:23.617
Would they ever hit the children?

12:25.224 --> 12:28.250
Uh, so you didn't get any spankings
or anything like that?

12:28.327 --> 12:31.592
- They didn't believe in spanking.
- They didn't believe in spankings.

12:31.664 --> 12:37.125
I see. Did you, uh-When they holler at
the children, what would the children do?

12:37.203 --> 12:38.966
- Cry.
- They would cry?

12:39.038 --> 12:41.268
- Did they ever holler at you?
- Yes.

12:41.340 --> 12:43.831
- Did you cry when you were hollered at?
- Yeah.

12:47.146 --> 12:50.445
- Did they-Did they say they loved you?
- Yeah.

12:50.516 --> 12:52.416
Did you love them?

13:10.136 --> 13:13.537
I came in contact with MOVE
back in 1974.

13:14.340 --> 13:16.399
We had a number of rap sessions
with youngsters...

13:16.476 --> 13:19.604
in terms of trying to offer
a different point of view.

13:19.679 --> 13:22.773
Did they appear to you
to be violent at all?

13:22.849 --> 13:28.515
No, it basically appeared to be a
progressive, uh, political organization...

13:28.588 --> 13:31.182
pretty much concerned
about the issues...

13:31.257 --> 13:33.555
that impacted
on the black community.

13:34.727 --> 13:39.027
Officer Cresse, was there any indication
that you were aware of...

13:39.098 --> 13:42.659
that, uh, the MOVE members
were potentially violent?

13:44.437 --> 13:47.838
Other than being, uh, vocal,
no, sir.

13:50.710 --> 13:53.304
They can put out weird things
like you can hear me use profanity.

13:53.379 --> 13:59.477
But is it possible to describe a maniac,
a profane, obscene, pornographic freak...

13:59.552 --> 14:01.315
without using profane words?

14:01.387 --> 14:04.254
Motherfuckers!

14:07.894 --> 14:13.730
Do you have information concerning how
many arrests occurred involving MOVE?

14:13.799 --> 14:16.495
There was 141 demonstrations.

14:18.204 --> 14:20.434
There was 97 court cases.

14:22.508 --> 14:27.070
There was eight meetings,
and there was 193 arrests.

14:28.814 --> 14:30.873
I have as just as much right...

14:30.950 --> 14:33.714
and my brother got just
as much right to speak as you.

14:33.786 --> 14:36.755
So what you doin' arrogantly
gaveling us down?

14:36.822 --> 14:39.518
- This is not a forum for your political views.
- What is it?

14:39.592 --> 14:43.050
- Do you understand that?
- Do you understand that I was brought here...

14:43.129 --> 14:45.962
because of my beliefs,
because of my views?

14:46.032 --> 14:48.967
I object. I think the witness,
at this point,

14:49.035 --> 14:51.265
is badgering the judge.

14:52.205 --> 14:55.368
They were, in fact,
telling the truth in the courtroom,

14:55.441 --> 14:57.739
and because the judge
could not dispute it,

14:57.810 --> 15:02.372
because the judge had went
to Harvard and Yale and Cornell...

15:02.448 --> 15:05.611
to learn what law was.

15:05.685 --> 15:08.813
They could not understand
how a people could stand there,

15:08.888 --> 15:13.257
looking as they did, but yet knowing
more, in fact, than they did.

15:13.326 --> 15:19.128
And this called for many contempts,
many beatings in the courtroom.

15:19.198 --> 15:22.497
And it was like a repeat
over and over again.

15:24.470 --> 15:30.898
Officer Cresse, directing your attention
to approximately March 30 of 1976,

15:30.977 --> 15:34.777
what, if anything occurred during
that time period with regard to MOVE.

15:35.815 --> 15:39.751
Twenty-four-hour surveillance was
established at the MOVE compound...

15:39.819 --> 15:42.083
at 309 North 33rd Street.

15:42.154 --> 15:46.648
Around the same time,
was there any, um,

15:46.726 --> 15:49.695
situation that arose
with regard to an infant?

15:49.762 --> 15:51.696
Yes, sir.
Could you describe that, sir?

15:51.764 --> 15:52.753
Okay.

15:59.572 --> 16:01.506
Just bear with me, please.

16:14.587 --> 16:18.455
On March 28 of this year,
at about 4:00 in the morning,

16:18.524 --> 16:22.893
some MOVE members were returning from
one of many sentences in the city jail.

16:22.962 --> 16:25.294
The MOVE people say
they weren't making a lot of noise.

16:25.364 --> 16:27.855
But someone in the neighborhood
complained to the police.

16:28.734 --> 16:30.838
What happened next is
the beginning of a

16:30.851 --> 16:32.966
controversy that has yet
to be investigated.

16:33.706 --> 16:36.072
Somehow an argument
led to a scuffle.

16:36.142 --> 16:38.702
Police reinforcements
were quickly on the scene,

16:38.778 --> 16:41.076
and MOVE put up resistance.

16:41.147 --> 16:44.139
By the time it was over,
six policemen reported injuries,

16:44.216 --> 16:46.116
six members of MOVE were arrested,

16:46.185 --> 16:48.983
and later, it was found that
three-week-old Life Africa,

16:49.055 --> 16:51.285
one of the MOVE babies, was dead.

16:59.999 --> 17:03.162
We went upstairs
to inquire reporters there.

17:03.836 --> 17:07.032
And we saw-
We were led into a dark room,

17:07.106 --> 17:11.372
and we saw what appeared to be
the remains of a baby.

17:12.377 --> 17:15.279
And it was their contention
that this baby had been killed...

17:15.348 --> 17:16.872
in a police raid.

17:18.050 --> 17:22.612
Subsequent to that, I introduced
the resolution to the city council,

17:22.688 --> 17:24.622
calling for an investigation.

17:24.690 --> 17:30.287
It never took place and I felt at that time
that the MOVE people were being harassed...

17:30.363 --> 17:32.354
and that it was a racial problem.

17:33.699 --> 17:37.396
Shortly thereafter,
I received some letters...

17:38.070 --> 17:40.664
from the people who live
on 32nd and Pearl Street.

17:41.874 --> 17:43.995
And they indicated that
they were displeased

17:44.008 --> 17:46.140
with MOVE, and they
wanted to meet me.

17:47.246 --> 17:49.714
And I went to the meeting
expecting to see...

17:53.352 --> 17:57.311
mostly Caucasian people
complaining about MOVE.

17:57.390 --> 18:00.951
And I was surprised
when I entered the home...

18:01.026 --> 18:06.157
that most of the people there were-were
black people, just ordinary black people.

18:07.032 --> 18:11.765
And for the first time I realized
that it was not a racial problem with MOVE.

18:11.837 --> 18:16.672
But that it was something else
that I just did not understand.

18:16.742 --> 18:22.044
And then I learned that unless you did
everything that they wanted you to do,

18:23.315 --> 18:25.613
uh, you were an enemy.

18:35.594 --> 18:39.360
On May 20, 1977,
MOVE brandished weapons...

18:39.432 --> 18:41.764
from their Powelton Village
headquarters platform...

18:41.834 --> 18:45.099
saying, "No longer will we be beaten
or intimidated by the police...

18:45.171 --> 18:47.105
without a like response."

18:50.309 --> 18:52.118
To your knowledge, did any
of the members of the

18:52.131 --> 18:53.950
MOVE organization ever
possess any weapons?

18:55.347 --> 18:57.338
- Not to my knowledge.
- Nor mine.

18:57.416 --> 19:01.182
Have you ever seen the pictures
of May 20, 1977, at Powelton Village,

19:01.253 --> 19:03.188
where people are carrying what appear,
at least, to be weapons?

19:03.213 --> 19:04.255
Yes, I have.

19:04.256 --> 19:05.541
Were those members of
the MOVE organization?

19:05.554 --> 19:06.850
Yes, they were.

19:06.926 --> 19:08.621
Were they weapons?
I don't know.

19:10.129 --> 19:12.962
I don't want anyone to think
that I'm insulting their intelligence,

19:13.032 --> 19:16.991
but when you have anything like that,

19:17.069 --> 19:20.095
regardless to what it looks like,

19:20.172 --> 19:23.243
if it is found inside of
the house or not found

19:23.256 --> 19:26.338
inside the house and
it is brought out...

19:26.412 --> 19:29.108
and it is found to be inoperable,

19:29.181 --> 19:31.115
it is found not to work at all,

19:31.183 --> 19:35.552
as far as I'm concerned,
it's not a weapon.

19:35.621 --> 19:37.816
But let me be clear.

19:37.890 --> 19:40.154
This can be a weapon.

19:40.226 --> 19:44.822
But I'm talking about to the point
of a weapon that can fire.

19:46.799 --> 19:50.030
It's just like you said.
What appeared to be weapons.

20:11.457 --> 20:15.018
In my view, it seemed
to suggest a turning point.

20:15.094 --> 20:18.029
It was the point
which it became clear...

20:18.097 --> 20:23.262
that MOVE, in fact,
could become a violent organization.

20:23.335 --> 20:26.702
Uh, would, in fact, fight,

20:26.772 --> 20:30.936
would, in fact, use weapons
in order to accomplish their mission.

20:32.611 --> 20:37.378
They named the game.
And I assure you, they lose.

20:37.449 --> 20:38.939
We'll do what's necessary.

20:39.018 --> 20:41.043
- What is that?
- The strategy of John Africa.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.815
- What is that?
- Our only defense.

20:42.888 --> 20:45.220
- What is that?
- The strategy of John Africa.

20:45.291 --> 20:47.885
You aren't tellin' me anything. You're just
saying "the strategy of John Africa."

20:47.960 --> 20:51.987
Hey, I wouldn't tell my strategy to you.

21:05.110 --> 21:07.231
We ain't talkin' about hurtin'
nobody's religion.

21:07.244 --> 21:09.376
We ain't talkin' about killin'
off nobody's religion.

21:09.448 --> 21:11.473
Rizzo is talkin' about
religious persecution.

21:11.550 --> 21:13.353
Don't question the person
tellin' the truth.

21:13.366 --> 21:15.179
Question the person
that's tellin' the lie.

21:15.254 --> 21:16.585
All right!

21:25.431 --> 21:29.333
Only in a democracy could they get away
with what they're getting away with.

21:56.362 --> 21:58.887
People are people regardless
of their color, their skin,

21:58.964 --> 22:00.488
their religion, their race or nothin'.

22:00.566 --> 22:03.057
They're still people.
They can bleed. They can die.

22:03.135 --> 22:06.070
They can catch diseases.
We can all go through the same situations.

22:06.138 --> 22:10.632
It's unnecessary for all of that.
I really think it's unnecessary.

22:13.512 --> 22:15.633
And it's all going to
boil down to a bunch of

22:15.646 --> 22:17.778
people getting hurt and
killed over nothin'.

22:17.850 --> 22:20.216
Over nothin' that doesn't really
make any sense.

22:24.790 --> 22:29.022
At 6:10 a.m., Mayor Rizzo finally,
after 15 months of confrontation,

22:29.094 --> 22:31.654
used the force he threatened all along.

22:31.730 --> 22:35.097
The police will be in there to drag
them out by the backs of their necks.

22:35.167 --> 22:39.570
They're going to be taken by force
if they resist.

22:39.638 --> 22:42.004
If police come in there with their hands,
we'll use our hands.

22:42.074 --> 22:44.736
If they come in here with clubs,
we'll use clubs.

22:44.810 --> 22:47.836
But if they come in here shootin' and
killin' our women and children and our men,

22:47.913 --> 22:50.609
we will shoot back
in defense of our lives.

22:50.683 --> 22:55.177
I've learned one thing as a policeman.
You never underestimate your opponent.

22:55.254 --> 23:00.920
You always get in there faster with more
than is necessary, and you overpower them.

23:17.076 --> 23:20.239
Stakeout personnel, using body shields,

23:20.312 --> 23:26.376
cover fireman as they position a portable
deluge gun closer to the compound.

23:38.964 --> 23:40.898
Shots have been fired!

23:40.966 --> 23:44.402
Officers and firemen are
wounded by gunfire.

23:44.470 --> 23:47.598
First deluge gun goes out of control.

23:53.746 --> 23:58.115
Other officers and firemen
move in to pull the wounded personnel...

23:58.183 --> 24:00.378
out of the line of fire.

24:01.253 --> 24:04.222
Officer Ramp, shown here
lying on his back,

24:04.289 --> 24:06.655
has now been mortally wounded.

24:06.725 --> 24:08.659
Officer Hesson, also wounded,

24:08.727 --> 24:11.924
crawls over and attempts
to shield officer Ramp.

24:41.627 --> 24:44.619
Mr. Rendell, um,

24:44.696 --> 24:48.223
did you consider the MOVE organization
to be a terrorist group?

24:48.300 --> 24:51.827
They had demonstrated
a past history of violence.

24:51.904 --> 24:56.932
Uh, they had demonstrated
a willingness to use violence, force...

24:57.009 --> 25:01.105
or the threat of violence or force
to achieve their objectives.

25:01.180 --> 25:04.775
It was almost difficult,
if not well nigh impossible,

25:04.850 --> 25:07.148
to deal with them
in any rational basis...

25:07.219 --> 25:10.108
that their stated goals
as a group that was a

25:10.121 --> 25:13.021
back-to-nature group were,
frankly, a bunch of bull.

25:14.293 --> 25:17.319
People who have killed one person,

25:17.396 --> 25:20.957
injured several others, people who
threaten to blow up people's houses,

25:21.033 --> 25:24.992
people who threaten to shoot and kill
neighbors, police, elected officials-

25:25.070 --> 25:29.166
I think that's a pretty adequate
description of the word "terrorist."

26:05.577 --> 26:09.240
With every step of the way,
including the final act today,

26:09.314 --> 26:14.013
the police used commendable restraint,
uh, and it was done for many reasons.

26:14.086 --> 26:17.214
Most of all because of the children
who are present today.

26:17.289 --> 26:20.156
There had been much concern
on the part of many people...

26:20.225 --> 26:23.820
that the police would make
a violent assault on the MOVE members.

26:23.896 --> 26:27.332
As it turned out, the police
acted with precision and restraint.

26:27.399 --> 26:29.572
When one of the MOVE
members came out of the

26:29.585 --> 26:31.768
window with a cartridge
case in one hand,

26:31.837 --> 26:34.431
a clip and with a knife in the other,

26:34.506 --> 26:37.441
he was hit on the top of the head
with a steel helmet...

26:37.509 --> 26:39.443
and was taken into custody.

26:39.511 --> 26:41.604
That's what you're referring to.

26:50.923 --> 26:53.016
He's hittin' him. He's hittin' him.

26:53.091 --> 26:55.753
Hittin' him on the head.
Kickin' him on the head!

26:58.063 --> 27:00.031
I have no idea. I couldn't see.

27:00.098 --> 27:03.261
- Cops, you're makin' a mistake doin' that.
- Your ass they are.

27:05.704 --> 27:09.697
The police probably would have been
legally within their rights...

27:09.775 --> 27:12.938
to have killed all of the 12 people
in that basement.

27:14.313 --> 27:16.781
Do you believe
this is a symbolic gesture,

27:16.848 --> 27:20.443
tearing their house down at this point,
the very day of the shootout?

27:20.519 --> 27:23.454
I think behind it is
the question we gotta ask is why.

27:33.098 --> 27:37.467
There's a suspicion that some shots
had come from elsewhere.

27:37.536 --> 27:40.038
Walt Hunter from WCAU,
by the way, swears that

27:40.051 --> 27:42.564
a shot was fired going
in this direction.

27:52.517 --> 27:55.782
People who know us
know that we're not terrorists.

27:55.854 --> 28:00.052
We fight cops because they're dirty.
They're filthy. They're criminal.

28:01.093 --> 28:05.757
The sad part of it is
that this incident is not yet over.

28:05.831 --> 28:09.392
There will still be misguided voices
in the community...

28:10.469 --> 28:12.960
seeking clemency
for these criminals.

28:13.038 --> 28:16.030
Long live MOVE!
Long live revolution!

28:16.108 --> 28:20.602
Long live John Africa!
it's the MOVE organization.

28:38.330 --> 28:42.596
What they should have done
is shot that goddamn bum,

28:42.667 --> 28:45.067
and then there would have been
no trouble today.

28:50.509 --> 28:54.070
This police department in Philadelphia
could invade Cuba and win.

28:54.646 --> 29:00.551
What I'm saying, Tom Snyder, is that we are
now trained and equipped to fight wars.

29:00.619 --> 29:05.852
Four more years, hell no!
No more Rizzo! Got to go!

29:05.924 --> 29:10.691
Four more years, hell no!
No more Rizzo! Got to go!

29:10.762 --> 29:13.094
Four more years, hell no!

29:19.371 --> 29:26.243
All of us, from all neighborhoods,
from all walks of life...

29:27.079 --> 29:30.776
can solve the problem
facing our city.

29:42.260 --> 29:45.593
Leapheart was asked how he felt
when the verdict was read.

29:49.167 --> 29:51.590
What are your plans in
terms of staying in

29:51.603 --> 29:54.036
Philadelphia and trying to
continue the MOVE cult?

29:54.106 --> 29:56.438
It's not a cult.
It's an organization.

30:08.453 --> 30:11.945
When you appear to be different...

30:12.757 --> 30:15.123
you become angry,

30:15.193 --> 30:19.027
and you will do things
out of the norm.

30:41.119 --> 30:44.577
Did you ever think about leaving MOVE?

30:45.991 --> 30:47.151
Yeah.

30:47.225 --> 30:50.592
- Uh, when was that?
- A long time ago.

30:50.662 --> 30:53.756
A long time ago?
Why did you want to leave MOVE?

30:59.804 --> 31:02.932
'Cause we couldn't do
what other kids do.

31:03.008 --> 31:05.568
You couldn't do
what the other kids did?

31:07.345 --> 31:10.166
Uh, what were the other
children allowed to do

31:10.179 --> 31:13.011
who were outside of MOVE
that you couldn't do?

31:13.084 --> 31:17.350
Uh, play with toys and stuff
and ride bikes and watch TV.

31:18.924 --> 31:21.916
Did you tell anyone
that you wanted to leave?

31:23.428 --> 31:25.055
Who'd you tell?

31:25.130 --> 31:28.793
Oh, we told-
We told each other.

31:50.121 --> 31:52.055
This is a blue-collar neighborhood.

31:53.358 --> 31:59.354
And any given summer day
you have the children,

31:59.431 --> 32:01.899
uh, playing in the streets.

32:03.368 --> 32:08.533
You have a mother
maybe sitting on the steps.

32:10.075 --> 32:11.565
Neighbors talking to each other.

32:13.178 --> 32:17.308
And all of a sudden
on their loudspeaker,

32:17.382 --> 32:21.079
you'd hear a voice
would come out and say,

32:21.152 --> 32:24.849
"You motherfuckers.
What the fuck are you doin' out here now?"

32:26.024 --> 32:28.083
Do you know
what's going on here?

32:28.159 --> 32:33.153
You son of a bitches around here
fuckin' everybody up.

32:33.231 --> 32:34.823
"What the fuck is goin' on?"

32:37.068 --> 32:41.334
Anything that was vile,
they would go into it.

32:51.916 --> 32:55.010
The filth-it was-it was...

32:55.086 --> 33:00.080
unbelievable that something like this
could be in someone's mind.

33:01.192 --> 33:03.786
It's one thing to be two blocks away
and hear it.

33:03.862 --> 33:09.528
But to live right next door,
full blast in our bedroom.

33:09.601 --> 33:12.798
I watched my wife many nights
lay there in that bed and cry.

33:12.871 --> 33:14.805
Wasn't nothin' else she could do.

33:14.873 --> 33:18.036
I think that, uh,
what we really hoped for...

33:18.109 --> 33:20.043
was that some kind of way...

33:20.111 --> 33:23.774
the city would find a way
to deal with the situation.

33:30.121 --> 33:35.923
The only thing that was happening
is that MOVE was taking a stand...

33:35.994 --> 33:40.397
against the injustice that has
been dropped on them...

33:40.465 --> 33:45.164
by this administration
and the Rizzo administration.

33:45.236 --> 33:49.297
MOVE'S principle has never changed.

33:50.508 --> 33:55.207
MOVE'S mood,
I'm talking about bitterness now,

33:55.280 --> 33:56.770
did change.

34:00.285 --> 34:04.346
They made, in my view,
a conscious decision...

34:05.323 --> 34:11.228
to aggravate residents to the point
was that the residents would, in fact,

34:11.295 --> 34:15.960
demand for the city to take actions
to provide them with relief.

34:16.868 --> 34:20.634
And in that regard, the city would be
forced into doing one of two things,

34:21.906 --> 34:25.672
to engage in confrontation
or to engage in compromise.

34:27.011 --> 34:30.071
There was a lot of hostility
between those two entities.

34:30.148 --> 34:33.049
I think it must be researched
why the hostility was there.

34:33.118 --> 34:35.052
Which two entities, Mr. Bond?

34:35.120 --> 34:37.452
Uh, the city of Philadelphia
and the MOVE organization.

34:37.522 --> 34:40.581
And as a pawn,
we were caught in-between.

34:40.658 --> 34:43.252
And nobody, frankly, gave a damn.

34:54.005 --> 34:59.238
I met with 15 residents,
uh, of Osage Avenue...

34:59.310 --> 35:02.746
on Memorial Day, 1984.

35:03.815 --> 35:05.942
At that meeting, I said to them...

35:06.017 --> 35:11.683
that I will research as to whether or not
there is a legal basis,

35:12.524 --> 35:18.087
uh, for the city to do something about
the problem that you have brought to us.

35:19.097 --> 35:21.497
But also pointed out to them...

35:21.566 --> 35:24.535
that the mayor does not
have the authority...

35:24.602 --> 35:29.039
because he does not like,
or the neighbors do not like,

35:29.107 --> 35:31.598
the way someone live...

35:31.676 --> 35:34.167
to simply go in and evict the people
from their house.

35:34.245 --> 35:38.147
We don't have those kinds of options
in this democracy.

35:43.455 --> 35:46.891
Today, more than three dozen Philadelphia
policemen surrounded the building...

35:46.958 --> 35:49.381
after a MOVE member was
spotted on the roof

35:49.394 --> 35:51.827
wearing a hooded mask
and carrying a shotgun.

35:51.896 --> 35:53.989
That standoff
lasted less than two hours.

35:54.065 --> 35:57.057
Police did not enter the house,
and no arrests were made.

35:57.135 --> 35:59.154
In the last several
weeks, their actions have

35:59.167 --> 36:01.196
escalated tensions in
the neighborhood...

36:01.272 --> 36:03.900
leading to tonight's situation.

36:04.476 --> 36:07.877
When the individual was on the roof
with the mask and the shotgun,

36:07.946 --> 36:10.540
my daughter was in our picture window.

36:11.216 --> 36:15.516
And she said, "Daddy, what is the man
doing on top of the roof with a gun?"

36:18.890 --> 36:21.256
And I didn't have an answer.

36:22.460 --> 36:24.394
She asked, "isn't that against the law?"

36:25.997 --> 36:27.931
And I said yes.

36:30.235 --> 36:32.942
Well, I don't know how
you can say that for

36:32.955 --> 36:35.673
a certain group of people,
the law applies...

36:35.740 --> 36:38.573
and then another group of people,
that same law doesn't apply.

36:39.744 --> 36:43.680
I think we were in the law
on an equal basis, if I'm correct.

36:46.818 --> 36:51.881
You would see them dragging logs
from the park up the street.

36:51.956 --> 36:55.392
You could see that the line
in the street...

36:55.460 --> 36:59.521
from, I guess, the oil out of the trees
that they would drag up.

36:59.597 --> 37:05.035
Wood would be stacked up
in front of the house at 6221.

37:05.103 --> 37:10.871
There was so much of it
that we requested that they...

37:10.942 --> 37:12.204
do something with it.

37:12.277 --> 37:14.302
What was the response
to that request?

37:14.379 --> 37:18.440
They responded
and put it on top of the roof.

37:23.788 --> 37:27.280
- We used to play on the roof.
- You used to play on the roof a lot?

37:27.358 --> 37:29.952
A lot of times.

37:30.028 --> 37:33.964
- Now, you said something about a bunker.
- Mm-hmm.

37:34.032 --> 37:36.933
How many bunkers were there
on the roof?

37:37.001 --> 37:38.491
- Two.
- Two?

37:38.570 --> 37:41.937
And do you know
what they were made of?

37:51.115 --> 37:53.310
What kind of holes
did they have in the bunkers?

37:53.384 --> 37:58.344
Like the bunker was halfway over the
roof like this, and you could look down.

37:58.423 --> 38:01.824
You could see up the street
in the-all over.

38:02.660 --> 38:04.150
Do you know what
those holes were for?

38:23.915 --> 38:29.444
That bunker you see there
is kind of a toyish-looking thing,

38:29.520 --> 38:34.890
and I will tell you on Osage Avenue,
it commanded the scene.

38:35.827 --> 38:39.456
It overlooked and overpowered anything
you may-you can imagine.

38:39.530 --> 38:41.464
It was awesome.

38:42.433 --> 38:45.197
There's been talk that there
are explosives in this house.

38:45.269 --> 38:47.533
Uh, is there any truth to that?

38:47.605 --> 38:50.472
That's only people's,
you know, hallucination...

38:50.541 --> 38:52.338
because they have
not been inside this house.

38:52.410 --> 38:54.344
So they would not know
what is in this house.

38:54.412 --> 38:58.940
What is in this house is the strategy
of John Africa that is very explosive.

38:59.917 --> 39:02.943
Is it a confrontation?
It most certainly is a confrontation,

39:03.021 --> 39:06.923
one strategized by John Africa
years and years and years ago.

39:10.395 --> 39:13.592
Commissioner, could you tell us
what the lessons were...

39:13.665 --> 39:18.693
that you felt were learned in the 1978
confrontation from your point of view?

39:18.770 --> 39:25.175
From my point of view, sir,
was that MOVE was a group...

39:25.243 --> 39:30.146
who was bent by virtue of their dogma
and by their actions...

39:30.214 --> 39:35.618
of destroying civilized activity...

39:35.687 --> 39:39.521
and ability to live in
a neighborhood peacefully.

39:41.726 --> 39:45.389
Tonight, there are growing concerns
about the controversial group, MOVE.

39:45.463 --> 39:48.728
City officials met today for the second
straight day to discuss strategy.

39:48.800 --> 39:52.463
Sources reveal that Philadelphia's District
Attorney has now prepared the warrants...

39:52.537 --> 39:56.132
that are legally necessary to evict
MOVE members from their home.

39:56.207 --> 39:58.402
Once those warrants are signed by a judge,

39:58.476 --> 40:02.879
action by police to evict MOVE
could come at pretty much any time.

40:15.560 --> 40:20.054
Do you know a police officer
by the name of Delores Thompson?

40:20.131 --> 40:21.621
Yes, I do.

40:22.133 --> 40:26.160
Do you recall telling her that your
son Frank was ordered to attack you,

40:26.871 --> 40:30.034
that you were beaten until
you started to vomit violently,

40:30.108 --> 40:32.668
that Frank then placed a pillow
over your face...

40:32.744 --> 40:37.306
and asked John Africa
if he wanted you to be cycled or killed...

40:37.381 --> 40:40.839
and that John Africa replied,
"Not at this time?"

40:40.918 --> 40:42.783
Did she tell you that I said that?

40:42.854 --> 40:46.620
- I have her report of that conversation, Mrs. James.
- Okay.

40:46.691 --> 40:49.091
Well, if she-Were you satisfied
with what she said?

40:49.160 --> 40:51.594
- I'm asking you.
- Okay.

40:51.662 --> 40:54.460
I heard rumors to the effect
that my son had beaten me.

40:54.532 --> 40:56.767
I've also heard rumors
to the effect that

40:56.780 --> 40:59.026
Wilson Goode put his
wife's jaw on a pulley,

40:59.103 --> 41:00.730
that he beat the hell out of her.

41:00.805 --> 41:04.741
Will you ask Mayor Goode that when he comes
in here if he in fact beat his wife?

41:04.809 --> 41:06.640
And if not, why not?

41:06.711 --> 41:11.171
If it is relevant that my son beat me
or whether or not he did beat me,

41:11.249 --> 41:13.370
then I would say it is
just as relevant for you

41:13.383 --> 41:15.515
to ask Wilson Goode
when he comes in here,

41:15.586 --> 41:16.917
"Did he beat his wife?"

41:16.988 --> 41:19.013
I don't think you're gonna
ask him that.

41:19.090 --> 41:24.357
I really don't. But you should,
if you feel that it is relevant.

41:28.666 --> 41:33.865
Mr. Lytton, I just want to make it
clear in my mind so that I understand.

41:33.938 --> 41:38.375
Am I to assume that the bomb
was dropped on MOVE people...

41:38.442 --> 41:41.206
because Frank beat his mother?

41:41.279 --> 41:42.746
Ma'am, we're trying
to find out what happened,

41:42.814 --> 41:45.647
- and we'll continue asking questions.
- Oh. Okay.

42:07.038 --> 42:09.336
Of course, on Mother's Day,
the evacuation has been slow.

42:09.407 --> 42:10.897
People had plans for today.

42:10.975 --> 42:14.274
A few had decided that
they'd stay and not evacuate.

42:14.345 --> 42:16.614
But police have now
apparently advised those

42:16.627 --> 42:18.907
people that they think
it's best that they leave.

42:18.983 --> 42:23.113
I hope that it's resolved quickly...

42:23.187 --> 42:26.147
and have all confidence that the mayor's
going to be doing the right thing.

42:26.190 --> 42:29.353
I wouldn't mind staying myself, you see.

42:29.427 --> 42:30.826
But I was told to leave...

42:30.895 --> 42:34.194
just 'cause he don't know what the
extent of this is going to be, you know.

42:34.265 --> 42:35.562
What do you think?

42:35.633 --> 42:40.593
I think-Believe it or not,
I think you'll have to kill all of them.

42:41.439 --> 42:46.035
And neighbors have been told by police not
to return to their homes for 24 hours.

42:46.110 --> 42:48.169
That is 22:00 tomorrow night.

42:48.246 --> 42:52.012
Now, what will happen between now
and then remains to be seen, Charles.

42:52.083 --> 42:54.984
And, Casey, some of the neighbors,
as they were leaving, said to me...

42:55.052 --> 42:57.020
that as they were going,
leaving the neighborhood,

42:57.088 --> 42:59.488
the MOVE people were sitting out
in front of the MOVE house,

42:59.557 --> 43:01.115
the children in hand.

43:01.192 --> 43:06.095
Perhaps that was a subtle or not-so-subtle
indication of what's happening here.

43:06.998 --> 43:10.195
Did you consider, sir,
that at least in 1978,

43:10.268 --> 43:14.295
the members of the MOVE organization
who were at the Powelton Village house...

43:14.372 --> 43:19.901
had used their children, uh,
as if they were hostages?

43:19.977 --> 43:21.706
No, sir, I did not.

43:21.779 --> 43:25.010
You've said they came out
holding their children up as shields.

43:25.082 --> 43:27.312
Uh, I'm not an expert
in police science,

43:27.385 --> 43:29.785
but I think to the layman,

43:29.854 --> 43:32.721
that might suggest that they were
using their children as a hostage.

43:32.790 --> 43:35.987
That's why I'm asking you
why you did not consider that.

43:36.060 --> 43:39.757
They were using them simply as a ploy...

43:40.598 --> 43:43.897
and using that philosophy,

43:43.968 --> 43:47.699
that feeling that we had
for the sanctity of children...

43:47.772 --> 43:51.572
and everyone else,
to our disadvantage.

43:54.045 --> 43:57.606
I do not want to wake up tomorrow morning
and find myself short one son...

43:57.682 --> 44:00.088
because if this thing
kicks off, you're going

44:00.101 --> 44:02.517
to have bodies strewn
every which way.

44:02.586 --> 44:06.215
You're going to have children killed,
and you're going to have adults killed.

44:06.290 --> 44:11.227
I am very much afraid you're
going to have blood-soaked streets.

44:11.729 --> 44:15.665
Every one of us knew that there
was an extraordinarily high likelihood...

44:15.733 --> 44:17.223
that someone was going to die.

44:17.301 --> 44:19.701
We didn't know whether
it was going to be a policeman.

44:19.770 --> 44:21.533
We didn't know whether
it was going to be a fireman.

44:21.605 --> 44:23.806
We didn't know whether it was
going to be a MOVE member.

44:23.874 --> 44:26.280
The worse dread of all
was that it was going

44:26.293 --> 44:28.709
to be a child or a
neighbor or a bystander.

44:29.780 --> 44:33.307
I don't know if anyone on this panel
has ever had the responsibility...

44:33.384 --> 44:38.447
of saying "go" to a plan that you know
is going to cost human lives.

44:38.522 --> 44:41.616
Until you've done that,
it's very difficult to gauge...

44:41.692 --> 44:44.820
whether the city officials
were right or wrong in what they did.

44:46.097 --> 44:51.160
Did you all have meetings where you would
discuss what to do if the police came?

44:51.836 --> 44:54.737
Mm-mmm. Not us.

44:54.805 --> 44:57.672
Not the children?
How about the adults?

44:57.742 --> 44:59.733
How about the grown-ups?

44:59.810 --> 45:03.143
They were to be upstairs by their self
when they had their meetings.

45:03.214 --> 45:05.148
When they had their meetings?

45:05.216 --> 45:07.548
How often
would they have their meetings?

45:07.618 --> 45:09.813
- A lot of times.
- A lot of times?

45:09.887 --> 45:14.847
Did you ever sit in on-Were you
ever in any of their meetings?

45:14.925 --> 45:17.587
Do you ever know what
went on in those meetings?

45:17.661 --> 45:19.128
Mm-mmm.

45:20.164 --> 45:22.530
What is a confrontation?
Do you know?

45:23.434 --> 45:24.731
Like it was.

45:24.802 --> 45:27.362
But what happens
when you have a confrontation?

45:27.438 --> 45:29.736
When the cops come and stuff.

45:57.535 --> 46:02.199
What did you believe they might have
had by way of firearms in that house?

46:02.273 --> 46:05.333
We were led to believe that
they had automatic firearms.

46:07.445 --> 46:09.140
Shotguns.

46:09.213 --> 46:11.374
I guess just as well
as equipped as we were.

46:11.449 --> 46:13.349
Mm-hmm.

46:13.417 --> 46:19.185
And so based on what you believed they
had, then you went prepared to match?

46:19.890 --> 46:23.417
- To match or better than.
- Or to have superior?

46:23.494 --> 46:25.223
That's correct, sir.

46:27.565 --> 46:30.432
We interrupt regular programming
for this special report.

46:30.501 --> 46:33.959
I'm Dennis Woltering
with Harvey Clarke at 62nd and Vine...

46:34.038 --> 46:37.024
where authorities continue
preparations for an

46:37.037 --> 46:40.034
apparent confrontation with
the radical group, MOVE.

46:40.111 --> 46:42.443
Let me tell you what's happened
so far this morning.

46:42.513 --> 46:45.311
About two hours ago,
3:30 a.m.,

46:45.382 --> 46:48.818
utility crews moved into the area,
shut off gas and electricity.

46:48.886 --> 46:52.014
SWAT teams have been
converging on the area.

46:52.089 --> 46:56.492
You can see a fire truck behind me with
a deluge gun pointed back that way.

46:56.560 --> 46:58.687
It's aimed, apparently,
at the MOVE house.

46:58.762 --> 47:00.992
It looks like the scene is set.

47:15.679 --> 47:18.045
I got on my stomach,

47:18.115 --> 47:21.778
and with the bullhorn,
I read the message.

47:21.852 --> 47:24.878
And to be quite frank,
I was sweating it out.

47:25.756 --> 47:27.917
What did Commissioner Sambor
say, do you know?

47:27.992 --> 47:30.017
He was telling them to come out.

47:30.094 --> 47:32.221
Did you hear him saying that?

47:42.907 --> 47:45.842
What was the response
of the MOVE organization...

47:45.910 --> 47:48.845
when you read the arrest warrant
that they vacate the premises?

47:48.913 --> 47:51.347
That they would not surrender.

47:51.415 --> 47:54.748
- Can you tell us what else they said?
- That they would kill us all.

47:54.818 --> 47:56.342
And what else did they say?

47:56.420 --> 47:59.981
Uh, they said that, uh,

48:00.057 --> 48:02.525
that all of our wives would be widows.

48:02.593 --> 48:05.187
And what else did they say
about your wives?

48:06.764 --> 48:12.896
They said that our wives would be sleeping
with other men before the end of the day.

48:12.970 --> 48:15.666
- Did they describe what other kind of men?
- Yes, sir.

48:15.739 --> 48:17.229
Would you tell us?

48:17.308 --> 48:21.972
They said that our wives would be sleeping
with black men before the end of the day.

48:22.046 --> 48:25.277
Do you recall what your reaction was
to those statements?

48:25.349 --> 48:30.685
I accepted it, sir,
as some of their rhetoric...

48:30.754 --> 48:36.158
and attempts to incite the police
and myself to precipitous action.

48:51.775 --> 48:54.300
The police went in
about five minutes to 6:00.

48:54.378 --> 48:56.346
Just four minutes ago,
they pumped tear gas in...

48:56.413 --> 48:58.313
which ls in the area.

48:58.382 --> 49:02.978
The police began a deluge,
which you can see here.

49:03.053 --> 49:04.816
That water's actually
being pumped in...

49:04.888 --> 49:09.416
about, probably, 50 yards
into the MOVE compound.

49:10.828 --> 49:13.888
As you can see up the street,
Tom, if you just pan up there,

49:13.964 --> 49:18.367
it's a very surreal kind of scene.

49:18.435 --> 49:20.801
Very calm men standing around...

49:20.871 --> 49:25.433
as the cloud of tear gas,
the haze, kind of begins to lift.

49:25.509 --> 49:28.239
Here comes some more tear gas
down Addison Street.

49:28.312 --> 49:31.406
This apparently has expanded...

49:32.549 --> 49:35.848
to include the entire square block.

49:35.919 --> 49:39.650
Perhaps when the cloud clears,
we'll know a little bit more.

49:42.593 --> 49:47.530
What was the plan
for May 13, 1985?

49:47.598 --> 49:51.659
The tactical plan, as I understood it,

49:51.735 --> 49:56.695
was to remove the MOVE people,
all the people,

49:56.774 --> 49:58.435
from the house safely.

49:58.509 --> 50:00.568
That was the objective.

50:00.644 --> 50:06.879
It was to be done by causing
a diversion on the roof,

50:06.950 --> 50:10.647
inserting the insertion teams
on either side of the properties...

50:11.922 --> 50:17.360
and by then inducing
an amount of C.S. gas...

50:17.428 --> 50:19.089
in a sufficient concentration...

50:20.831 --> 50:23.800
to make those people
come out of the house.

50:24.635 --> 50:30.198
The police presence here
is not like it was the last time.

50:30.274 --> 50:33.175
This is being handled
almost entirely by the stakeout unit.

50:33.243 --> 50:35.541
There may have just been a gunshot.

50:35.612 --> 50:37.739
The gunshots are starting right now.

50:37.815 --> 50:41.114
It sounds like automatic fire, Steve.
There's quite a bit of it.

50:41.185 --> 50:44.225
We can't tell, Steve, at this point
exactly where the gunfire is coming from.

50:45.823 --> 50:50.226
Okay. Steve, at this point we're
being forced to leave our position.

50:50.294 --> 50:52.421
- We'll get back to you as soon as we can.
- Let's go.

50:52.496 --> 50:54.464
The police
are now moving Harvey Clarke.

50:54.531 --> 50:56.863
- Who shot first?
- They did.

50:56.934 --> 51:00.028
- How do you know?
- Because I was there.

51:00.104 --> 51:02.595
I understand that.
Did you see muzzle fire?

51:02.673 --> 51:05.870
- I'm just trying to determine how you have that knowledge.
 - No, sir, I did not.

51:05.943 --> 51:11.575
But one of the other teams reported
that they were receiving hostile fire.

51:11.648 --> 51:14.776
- Did it sound like automatic fire to you?
- It did. Yes, sir.

51:14.852 --> 51:18.151
And I take it you're familiar
with the sound of automatic weapons fire.

51:18.222 --> 51:19.985
I've heard automatic-
Yes, sir.

51:22.292 --> 51:25.386
Pat, as you can see, we have
reestablished our live signal.

51:25.462 --> 51:29.057
Tremendous bursts of gunfire
have rang out...

51:29.133 --> 51:31.795
in the area
of the 6200 block of Osage Avenue.

51:31.869 --> 51:34.804
Walt Hunter has joined me.
And, Walter, what have you learned?

51:34.872 --> 51:36.863
We have heard
several popping sounds here...

51:36.940 --> 51:39.431
indicating that gunfire
is getting much, much closer.

51:39.510 --> 51:41.398
But we don't know if the
guns you're hearing

51:41.411 --> 51:43.310
are police guns, MOVE
guns or other guns.

51:43.380 --> 51:45.644
About the only thing
we can confirm for you at this point...

51:45.716 --> 51:49.174
is that clearly, based on the nature of the
shoot-out we're seeing here this morning,

51:49.253 --> 51:52.745
MOVE did have some weaponry
either in the house or nearby.

52:03.767 --> 52:05.291
As you know, Commissioner,

52:05.369 --> 52:08.770
there were no automatic weapons
found in the MOVE house.

52:08.839 --> 52:11.774
Do you know whether or not
the automatic weapons fire you heard...

52:11.842 --> 52:14.037
was in fact from police officers?

52:15.913 --> 52:21.647
The firing, as initiated by MOVE,

52:21.718 --> 52:23.879
uh, was...

52:25.856 --> 52:30.225
apparently automatic fire,

52:30.294 --> 52:32.626
and I cannot explain it.

52:32.696 --> 52:37.690
But I do not believe for one minute...

52:37.768 --> 52:41.727
that it was the police
that were firing at that time.

52:43.106 --> 52:46.166
Once the MOVE members started firing,

52:46.243 --> 52:48.803
their status changed radically
in the eyes of the law.

52:48.879 --> 52:51.313
They at that point
became forcible felons,

52:51.381 --> 52:53.713
and there's a whole
different set of laws...

52:53.784 --> 52:56.685
as to the apprehension
and the amount of force that can be used...

52:56.753 --> 53:01.349
in the apprehension of and the prevention
of the escape of forcible felons.

53:01.425 --> 53:04.155
- Including the children?
- No.

53:04.228 --> 53:05.923
That's as to the adults.

53:07.030 --> 53:08.759
We went downstairs.

53:08.832 --> 53:12.268
Did the adults tell you
to go downstairs?

53:12.336 --> 53:14.600
And where did you go
when you went downstairs?

53:14.671 --> 53:16.536
- The garage.
- Into the garage?

53:16.607 --> 53:19.872
- But where were the men?
- They were upstairs.

53:19.943 --> 53:21.934
Do you know
what they were doing?

53:32.022 --> 53:35.856
Now, we know that the children
wasn't doing any shooting.

53:35.926 --> 53:39.127
- Do you feel that their rights-
- I did not know that the children were not shooting.

53:39.162 --> 53:42.893
What-Would you say that if we had children
in there four, five, six years old...

53:42.966 --> 53:45.093
that they would have been using
any type of weapons?

53:45.168 --> 53:48.535
To my knowledge,
there was only one that young.

53:51.842 --> 53:53.394
We would like to tell you
that the shoot-out is over.

53:53.407 --> 53:54.970
We cannot say that definitively.

53:55.045 --> 53:57.912
We can say there's been at least a 15-
or 20-minute break in the gunfights.

53:57.981 --> 54:01.439
Here comes a police car
racing in right now at this moment.

54:01.518 --> 54:04.851
This is a highway patrol car
racing into the scene.

54:04.922 --> 54:06.617
We don't know
what this signifies.

54:06.690 --> 54:10.057
We'd like to tell you it's over. We really
can't right now. There has been a pause.

54:10.127 --> 54:13.187
There are indications that what has been
a tremendous gunfight is over.

54:13.263 --> 54:15.163
Looking in the trunk of this car
right here.

54:15.232 --> 54:18.065
There's more gunfire right now.
We're gonna crouch down.

54:18.135 --> 54:21.366
As you were about to say, the police are
unloading, as you can see right now.

54:21.438 --> 54:24.430
The police are unloading
Winchester cartridge shells...

54:24.508 --> 54:27.170
from the back
of a highway patrol car.

54:28.779 --> 54:31.771
Do you know how many rounds
were fired that day?

54:31.848 --> 54:33.645
No, sir.

54:33.717 --> 54:38.313
But I will say that, uh-
uh, we ran out.

54:41.124 --> 54:44.582
Uh, we did not anticipate,

54:44.661 --> 54:51.123
uh, the extent
of the confrontation,

54:51.201 --> 54:53.032
uh, and ran out.

54:53.103 --> 54:57.563
Uh, I don't know what time it was,
but it was some time in the morning.

55:01.945 --> 55:04.277
What's happening is,
it's a shoot-out.

55:04.348 --> 55:08.751
Oh, man, and those kids and all that-

55:17.194 --> 55:21.290
The gunfire is as close as it's been since
the shoot-out happened this morning.

55:21.365 --> 55:22.889
Let's-Let's come closer.

55:22.966 --> 55:27.528
Let's come closer and use-and crouch
down behind the Eyewitness News truck.

55:32.209 --> 55:34.905
Oh, my God!

55:46.223 --> 55:48.748
Get down, lady. Get down. Yeah.

55:52.329 --> 55:55.321
Stay in the house.
Stay inside.

55:56.600 --> 55:59.091
I heard shots being fired,
and cops was in the alleyway.

55:59.169 --> 56:00.966
They was like,
"Get in the house. Don't come out."

56:01.038 --> 56:02.733
I was very, very frightened.

56:02.806 --> 56:04.296
You supposed
to nip something in the bud.

56:04.374 --> 56:05.813
If you see something's
coming, you're supposed

56:05.826 --> 56:07.275
to sit down and try
to iron it out...

56:07.344 --> 56:09.744
before something like this
comes to this stage.

56:09.813 --> 56:12.281
It's war. This is war.

56:12.349 --> 56:14.389
I've never seen it,
but I've lived through it today.

56:28.498 --> 56:30.159
This woman-We can't determine...

56:30.233 --> 56:34.670
whether she is a relative of one
of the MOVE members or not.

56:34.738 --> 56:37.366
It appeared that things
had gotten calm.

56:37.441 --> 56:41.935
And then as you heard, about a minute and
a half ago, another burst of gunfire.

56:42.012 --> 56:44.503
This woman is now being taken
into police custody.

56:44.581 --> 56:47.015
You're watching it live.
They are restraining her.

56:47.084 --> 56:51.453
She is hysterical and is clearly upset
about what's going on in there.

56:51.521 --> 56:54.888
Just trying to get her out of the danger
area where we are on the fringes right now.

56:56.193 --> 56:58.161
Did you have a concern...

56:58.228 --> 57:00.992
that the people
inside of that house...

57:01.064 --> 57:04.329
might be in physical danger
or that their lives might be in danger?

57:04.401 --> 57:06.961
Concern?
We knew it.

57:07.037 --> 57:08.527
- Miss-
- We-Excuse me.

57:08.605 --> 57:13.065
We had-
You had 200 boot-kicking,

57:13.143 --> 57:17.375
Gestapo-oriented cops
out there that day.

57:17.447 --> 57:23.147
You had, that day, a police officer
by the name of Mulvihill...

57:23.220 --> 57:29.750
who was in the 1978, uh, tragedy...

57:29.826 --> 57:35.787
who was, in fact, one of the
officers who stomped and kicked...

57:35.866 --> 57:38.596
and beat and bludgeoned...

57:38.668 --> 57:43.105
and shot and helmeted
and kicked some more...

57:43.173 --> 57:45.767
my brother, Delbert Africa.

57:45.842 --> 57:48.538
So as I understand
your testimony,

57:48.612 --> 57:50.477
you were concerned
that there may be physical harm...

57:50.547 --> 57:52.777
to the people inside that house,
is that correct?

57:52.849 --> 57:54.612
Would you turn up
your hearing aid, please?

57:54.684 --> 57:56.345
I can hear you fine, Mrs. James.

57:56.419 --> 57:58.046
- My question is-
- Well, then if you can hear me fine,

57:58.121 --> 58:00.783
if you don't have a hearing aid,
I suggest you get one.

58:00.857 --> 58:02.347
- Well, because-
- Excuse me!

58:02.425 --> 58:03.517
Yes, ma'am.

58:03.593 --> 58:05.754
To ask me...

58:05.829 --> 58:11.358
"were we concerned"
is complete insanity.

58:21.411 --> 58:26.747
By virtue of the fact that MOVE
had construction on the roof...

58:26.817 --> 58:29.718
that was commonly
referred to as the bunker,

58:29.786 --> 58:35.816
that gave them complete command
of the Osage Avenue,

58:35.892 --> 58:38.827
access over the roofs...

58:39.796 --> 58:43.664
they were in an enviable tactical position.

58:44.601 --> 58:47.161
The water cannon used
during the MOVE standoff today...

58:47.237 --> 58:50.900
shoots an estimated
1,000 gallons of water a minute.

58:50.974 --> 58:53.875
Sources say the purpose
of the water is threefold.

58:53.944 --> 58:56.845
First, to disorient
the people inside the house.

58:56.913 --> 59:01.748
Secondly, the water increases humidity,
which makes tear gas more effective.

59:01.818 --> 59:06.482
Thirdly, the powerful water pressure
could cause the house to collapse.

59:08.458 --> 59:13.987
If that plan relied solely on the ability
of our equipment to knock the bunker off,

59:14.064 --> 59:18.228
they knew very clearly up front
that we could not guarantee that, sir.

59:30.780 --> 59:34.546
Chris, I saw Police Commissioner
Gregore Sambor about 45 minutes ago,

59:34.618 --> 59:37.712
and he described his men
as, quote, "taking a break now."

59:37.787 --> 59:40.557
They're obviously somewhat
startled by the way that

59:40.570 --> 59:43.350
MOVE'S building at 62 and
Osage was fortified...

59:43.426 --> 59:47.920
and able to take the water barrage and the
bullets that flew in there this morning.

59:47.998 --> 59:49.590
Thousands of rounds spun off.

59:49.666 --> 59:52.635
Larry, for the first time,
it's been quiet for several hours here.

59:52.702 --> 59:54.789
The police helicopter did
go back up, and I guess

59:54.802 --> 59:56.900
they wanted to take a look
at the top of the bunker.

59:56.973 --> 59:59.430
We had reports-What you
see in front there,

59:59.443 --> 01:00:01.910
the yellow tarp is the front
of that building,

01:00:01.978 --> 01:00:04.310
and we were told
that that bunker was destroyed.

01:00:04.381 --> 01:00:05.973
But it appears that it's still there.

01:00:06.049 --> 01:00:08.745
Okay, Harvey.
They stopped the snorkel gun now.

01:00:08.818 --> 01:00:13.255
- There's no water on that roof.
- For some time, the water has been turned off.

01:00:13.323 --> 01:00:15.188
At City Hall this afternoon,

01:00:15.258 --> 01:00:17.590
Mayor Goode appeared publicly for the
first time since the siege began.

01:00:17.661 --> 01:00:21.529
Goode said he's committed
to removing MOVE from the structure.

01:00:21.598 --> 01:00:23.793
We intend to evict from the house.

01:00:23.867 --> 01:00:27.667
We intend to evacuate from the house, and
we intend to seize control of the house.

01:00:27.737 --> 01:00:32.470
- How will you do that?
- We will do it by any means necessary.

01:00:41.284 --> 01:00:43.275
Something is starting to happen.

01:00:43.353 --> 01:00:46.686
There is a big-
The fire engine has fired up again.

01:00:46.756 --> 01:00:49.281
Its engine is on
for the first time all afternoon.

01:00:49.359 --> 01:00:52.886
We just saw some police officers behind
us have their hands over their ears.

01:00:52.963 --> 01:00:55.693
We don't know why.
We can't hear anything at this point.

01:00:55.765 --> 01:00:58.290
I must say that this
tiny little flurry of activity...

01:00:58.368 --> 01:01:01.303
is really the first bit of activity
that there's been here all afternoon.

01:01:01.371 --> 01:01:02.861
It's been very quiet.

01:01:02.939 --> 01:01:06.170
Police say that they have a plan.
They say it will be implemented shortly.

01:01:06.242 --> 01:01:08.073
We will tell you what
it is when it happens.

01:01:08.144 --> 01:01:12.706
Reporting live from 62nd and Delancey, this
is Chris Wagner, Channel 6 Action News.

01:01:29.399 --> 01:01:32.800
This device that was used-
You're calling it a device.

01:01:32.869 --> 01:01:35.736
I'm calling it a bomb.
But did it ever occur to you...

01:01:35.805 --> 01:01:38.575
that this might have
been a dangerous device

01:01:38.588 --> 01:01:41.368
to use in a residential
neighborhood?

01:01:41.444 --> 01:01:43.105
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:43.179 --> 01:01:46.342
- It did occur to you?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:01:49.019 --> 01:01:50.509
By not vetoing it,

01:01:50.587 --> 01:01:53.852
did you approve the plan
to use an explosive on the roof?

01:01:53.923 --> 01:01:58.519
I think that I was fully aware
that it would, in fact, be used,

01:01:58.595 --> 01:02:02.497
and it is my view
that you can regard that...

01:02:02.565 --> 01:02:05.864
as an approval of using
the explosive on the roof, yes.

01:02:21.184 --> 01:02:25.518
...right there in a 10-15 foot hover
above the roof.

01:02:25.588 --> 01:02:29.854
And I was right on the left-hand side
of the helicopter right here.

01:02:29.926 --> 01:02:33.225
Onto this corner
is where I finally came to a stop.

01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:09.298
You were down in the garage,
is that right?

01:03:09.365 --> 01:03:14.325
We was down there for a while,
and then everybody came down.

01:03:14.404 --> 01:03:18.704
- All the men came down?
- That's when the big bomb went off.

01:03:29.953 --> 01:03:32.217
It shook the whole house up.

01:03:36.693 --> 01:03:38.854
Police say there has just been
a huge explosion here.

01:03:38.928 --> 01:03:41.829
We don't know what it means,
but it just shook the whole place.

01:03:41.898 --> 01:03:45.459
Debris flew all over the place.
I don't know what that explosion was.

01:03:45.535 --> 01:03:48.231
All I can tell you
is that it was a huge blast.

01:03:48.304 --> 01:03:49.896
Get a shot with me.
Get a sh-

01:03:49.973 --> 01:03:52.893
- Harvey, can you hear us?
- At this point, I really can't tell you very much.

01:03:52.942 --> 01:03:56.400
There was about a 15-second delay,
then an explosion.

01:03:56.479 --> 01:03:58.999
Perhaps the most frightening thing here
is that police do say...

01:03:59.015 --> 01:04:01.696
that six to eight children are believed
to be inside the MOVE house.

01:04:01.751 --> 01:04:04.549
As soon as we find out what the
explosion is, we will try to tell you.

01:04:04.621 --> 01:04:06.555
At this point, I simply do not know.

01:04:08.892 --> 01:04:12.158
After the explosion, you saw that the
bunker was still there.

01:04:12.183 --> 01:04:13.228
Yes, sir.

01:04:13.229 --> 01:04:15.185
Did you observe any smoke
or fire on the roof?

01:04:15.198 --> 01:04:17.165
I did not.

01:04:17.233 --> 01:04:20.862
And-I did hear over the
radio that there was none.

01:04:45.328 --> 01:04:50.459
It's easy to equate explosions
and explosive materials with fire.

01:04:50.533 --> 01:04:52.023
But that's not necessarily so.

01:04:52.101 --> 01:04:53.829
'Cause I think we've
all seen buildings

01:04:53.842 --> 01:04:55.581
demolished, and it's used
all the time in mining.

01:04:55.605 --> 01:04:58.802
So I don't think you
can just logically conclude...

01:04:58.875 --> 01:05:02.606
if you're going to have an explosion,
you're going to have a fire.

01:05:02.679 --> 01:05:05.910
There's no more smoke. And at this
point, looking over my shoulder,

01:05:05.982 --> 01:05:10.043
the water barrage appears
to have ended again.

01:05:29.038 --> 01:05:32.565
Okay, there is a new development
at the MOVE building, 62nd and Osage.

01:05:32.642 --> 01:05:34.940
We'll go live right away
to Harvey Clarke at the scene.

01:05:35.011 --> 01:05:37.741
- What's going on, Harvey?
- Larry, behind me you can probably see right now-

01:05:37.814 --> 01:05:39.577
We'll push and try
to get a little tighter shot of it-

01:05:39.649 --> 01:05:43.608
that the satchel charge, or whatever-
the explosive or bomb...

01:05:43.686 --> 01:05:46.211
that was dropped on the MOVE compound
just a few minutes ago...

01:05:46.289 --> 01:05:48.519
has apparently started
a serious fire.

01:05:48.591 --> 01:05:52.493
But the two deluge guns or sprinklers...

01:05:52.562 --> 01:05:56.726
that they've been pumping water in
from Pine Street are not active now.

01:05:58.067 --> 01:06:01.559
I wanted to get the bunker.

01:06:01.638 --> 01:06:07.474
I wanted to be able to
somehow have tactical superiority...

01:06:07.543 --> 01:06:12.606
without sacrificing any lives,
if it were at all possible.

01:06:14.784 --> 01:06:17.344
Commissioner Sambor said to me.

01:06:18.388 --> 01:06:20.788
He said let's let the bunker burn...

01:06:20.857 --> 01:06:24.759
to eliminate that high ground advantage
and the tactical advantage of the bunker.

01:06:24.827 --> 01:06:26.317
And I said, "Yeah, okay."

01:06:26.396 --> 01:06:28.694
it was not an order.

01:06:28.765 --> 01:06:31.063
In essence, in communication-

01:06:31.134 --> 01:06:35.628
I communicated to him
that I would like to let the fire burn.

01:06:49.819 --> 01:06:51.660
Larry, this is becoming
a very emotional scene.

01:06:51.721 --> 01:06:53.348
With me is Janice Walker.

01:06:53.423 --> 01:06:55.948
She lives at 6217 Osage,

01:06:56.025 --> 01:06:58.823
- just two doors from the MOVE house.
- Yes.

01:06:58.895 --> 01:07:00.954
And you're afraid
that your house may be on fire.

01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:03.965
I'm sure it's just destroyed,
and it's just not fair.

01:07:04.033 --> 01:07:07.560
We've been there over 20 years, and we
didn't have to have to go through this.

01:07:07.637 --> 01:07:11.073
We only left with a few odds
and ends, you know, for the night.

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:14.007
We had no idea it was
gonna be this devastating.

01:07:14.077 --> 01:07:17.046
You've got innocent people that
live around there on Osage Avenue,

01:07:17.113 --> 01:07:18.910
and they just, you know-

01:07:18.981 --> 01:07:21.779
Their properties have just
gone up in smoke.

01:07:32.628 --> 01:07:37.122
I saw initially a small fire on the roof.

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.169
I saw what appeared...

01:07:40.236 --> 01:07:44.366
to be some water coming in.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.000
I determined later
that that was not water at all...

01:07:47.076 --> 01:07:52.810
but was basically the kind of snow
on my television screen.

01:07:52.882 --> 01:07:55.476
And after about five minutes
of watching that,

01:07:55.551 --> 01:07:59.487
I gave what was
my first order of the day,

01:07:59.555 --> 01:08:01.546
which was "put the fire out."

01:08:02.258 --> 01:08:07.286
You are aware that
the mayor has testified...

01:08:07.363 --> 01:08:12.630
that at approximately 6:00
on the evening of May 13,

01:08:12.702 --> 01:08:16.160
he ordered that the fire be put out.

01:08:16.238 --> 01:08:19.072
I heard the testimony, yes, sir.

01:08:21.711 --> 01:08:24.770
Do you know whether or not...

01:08:24.846 --> 01:08:29.147
there had been any order
to put the fire out?

01:08:31.787 --> 01:08:33.813
Yes, sir.

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:37.587
- Did you convey that order to anyone else?
- Yes, sir.

01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:41.653
- To whom?
- The fire commissioner was still there.

01:08:42.698 --> 01:08:44.461
To whom?

01:08:44.533 --> 01:08:47.867
The fire commissioner was still there.

01:08:48.871 --> 01:08:52.363
- Those responses were Commissioner Sambor, sir?
- Yes, sir.

01:08:52.442 --> 01:08:53.932
I categorically deny that.

01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:57.002
I had no knowledge
of an order to extinguish that fire.

01:09:43.292 --> 01:09:47.194
Was there any smoke or tear gas
in the garage when you were down there?

01:09:47.263 --> 01:09:49.754
- Or was there tear gas?
- It was smoke and tear gas.

01:09:49.832 --> 01:09:51.322
Smoke and tear gas?

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:55.234
Did it bother you? Did it burn
your eyes or anything?

01:09:55.304 --> 01:09:57.033
And what did you all do?

01:09:57.106 --> 01:09:59.734
We was under the blanket
with our heads.

01:09:59.809 --> 01:10:02.004
- Were all the kids under blankets?
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:02.078 --> 01:10:04.876
- Where were the women?
- Under blankets.

01:10:04.947 --> 01:10:08.007
They were under blankets?
Now, you said the blankets were wet.

01:10:08.084 --> 01:10:09.073
Mm-hmm.

01:10:09.151 --> 01:10:13.178
- How did the blankets get wet?
- 'Cause we had 'em in the bucket.

01:10:13.256 --> 01:10:14.848
Bucket of water.

01:10:19.762 --> 01:10:25.496
Isn't it true, Commissioner Sambor
and fire Commissioner Richmond,

01:10:25.568 --> 01:10:32.235
that you in effect made a decision
to use fire as a weapon in this instance?

01:10:32.308 --> 01:10:34.776
Absolutely not, sir.

01:10:36.546 --> 01:10:42.815
Well, you made a decision to let that
fire burn until the bunker was destroyed.

01:10:42.885 --> 01:10:44.819
- Isn't that right?
- When you talk about a weapon,

01:10:44.887 --> 01:10:48.687
you talk about a weapon as being
used against probably individuals,

01:10:48.758 --> 01:10:53.354
and that was never a consideration
nor would I ever use it as a consideration.

01:10:53.429 --> 01:10:55.659
Well, fire Commissioner Richmond,

01:10:55.731 --> 01:10:58.700
what did you understand the police
commissioner was asking you to do?

01:10:58.768 --> 01:11:01.236
I would respond in the same way,
Justice Kaufmann.

01:11:01.304 --> 01:11:03.224
There is no one that I know
in city government...

01:11:03.239 --> 01:11:06.834
that would intentionally go out there
to burn those people like that.

01:11:06.909 --> 01:11:08.900
There's no one that I know of
could do that.

01:11:33.102 --> 01:11:37.198
You were aware in 1978, I assume,

01:11:37.273 --> 01:11:40.265
that a situation had developed...

01:11:40.343 --> 01:11:44.507
involving certain police officers
and Delbert Africa?

01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:46.172
Yes, sir.

01:11:46.248 --> 01:11:47.738
Did you give any instructions...

01:11:47.817 --> 01:11:50.405
as to whether or not
the officers who were

01:11:50.418 --> 01:11:53.016
specifically involved
in that altercation...

01:11:53.089 --> 01:11:58.550
should or should not be included
in the operation for May 13, 1985?

01:11:58.628 --> 01:12:00.493
I did not.

01:12:00.563 --> 01:12:07.332
Weren't you concerned that there
might be some revenge motive...

01:12:07.403 --> 01:12:11.863
which may take the police action
beyond the legal limits?

01:12:11.941 --> 01:12:13.926
I think there's no question
there was, at least

01:12:13.939 --> 01:12:15.934
on the part of some
policemen, residual anger...

01:12:16.012 --> 01:12:19.641
towards MOVE organization
or members thereof.

01:12:19.715 --> 01:12:21.205
No question about that.

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.948
Would the court reporter
please swear in the witnesses?

01:12:27.023 --> 01:12:28.291
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth, the

01:12:28.304 --> 01:12:29.583
whole truth and nothing
but the truth...

01:12:29.659 --> 01:12:32.150
- so help you God?
- I do.

01:12:32.228 --> 01:12:38.030
Officer D'Ulisse, I understand that in
1978, you were present on August 8...

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:42.764
during an altercation
that occurred with Delbert Africa.

01:12:42.838 --> 01:12:44.396
Yes.

01:12:44.473 --> 01:12:46.065
And officer Mulvihill?

01:12:46.142 --> 01:12:49.407
What does that have to do
with May the 13th?

01:12:49.478 --> 01:12:51.639
The officer was tried and found
not guilty of that offense.

01:12:51.714 --> 01:12:54.376
That was going to be
my next statement, Mr. Mozenter.

01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:58.546
Officer, we understand that you were
charged in connection with that case,

01:12:58.621 --> 01:13:01.590
and also we understand
that there was a direct

01:13:01.603 --> 01:13:04.582
verdict by Judge Dibona of
not guilty in that case.

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:06.787
- Is that correct?
- That's correct.

01:13:08.297 --> 01:13:10.515
Stakeout police have just
taken position.

01:13:10.528 --> 01:13:12.757
There must be movement
somewhere in the Osage,

01:13:12.835 --> 01:13:19.399
and they're all scattering
between 62nd and Osage and 63rd.

01:13:19.475 --> 01:13:22.171
They're running around like
something's going on around here.

01:13:22.244 --> 01:13:25.736
These are live pictures.
They are looking for something there.

01:13:25.815 --> 01:13:29.307
You can hear hollering. Where it was
coming from, Larry, I don't know.

01:13:30.786 --> 01:13:33.277
When the fire got real heavy,

01:13:33.355 --> 01:13:35.619
when we smelled all that smoke,
and we couldn't breathe,

01:13:35.691 --> 01:13:39.218
then that's when we started
yelling that "kids coming out,"

01:13:39.295 --> 01:13:45.996
and then they opened the garage door
and opened the cellar window.

01:13:46.068 --> 01:13:47.899
What did you say?
What did you yell?

01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:50.905
We were saying,
"We wanna come out!"

01:13:50.973 --> 01:13:52.998
"We wanna come out?"

01:13:53.075 --> 01:13:55.771
And what did the other children do?
Did they do the same thing?

01:13:55.845 --> 01:13:57.176
Yeah.

01:13:57.246 --> 01:14:01.683
- Were any of the children crying?
- Yeah. We all was.

01:14:03.185 --> 01:14:07.815
- Why had you all gone to the back alley?
- To prevent the escape of MOVE members.

01:14:07.890 --> 01:14:10.085
Well, what did you expect
to find in that alley,

01:14:10.159 --> 01:14:12.457
the reason why you took
a machine gun back there?

01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:16.923
I had no idea what to expect in the alley.

01:14:22.972 --> 01:14:24.963
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth...

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.440
- and nothing but the truth so help you God?
- I do.

01:14:31.247 --> 01:14:35.445
Your vantage point
was to the back of 6221.

01:14:35.518 --> 01:14:37.145
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

01:14:37.219 --> 01:14:39.949
All right.
Was there any time...

01:14:40.022 --> 01:14:43.788
that you observed
either with your eyes or your ears...

01:14:43.859 --> 01:14:46.350
people attempting
to come out of that house?

01:14:47.163 --> 01:14:51.998
I heard a female scream,
"Don't shoot. We're coming out."

01:14:52.067 --> 01:14:55.230
At that time officer Trudel
who was at the rear window.

01:14:55.304 --> 01:14:57.795
Officer Trudel said,
"They're coming out."

01:15:00.676 --> 01:15:02.581
if you look carefully,
by the way, if you can

01:15:02.594 --> 01:15:04.510
take a look so I can point
to the monitor here,

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:08.448
right here is a line
of stakeout squad officers,

01:15:08.517 --> 01:15:11.884
and they seem to be lined up at the
ready waiting for something to happen.

01:15:11.954 --> 01:15:15.219
They seem to be waiting for something
to come out of that house.

01:15:15.291 --> 01:15:18.055
You said that Rad
tried to take Tomaso out?

01:15:18.127 --> 01:15:19.651
Mm-hmm.

01:15:19.728 --> 01:15:24.597
He was on his knees, and he had
Tomaso around his stomach like that.

01:15:24.667 --> 01:15:27.659
On his knees?
Was he crawling along the garage floor?

01:15:27.736 --> 01:15:29.328
Rad was.

01:15:42.151 --> 01:15:45.086
Now, when they did come out,
I see the smaller child come out,

01:15:45.154 --> 01:15:47.019
and then an adult male
come out right behind them.

01:15:47.089 --> 01:15:48.351
Yeah.

01:15:48.424 --> 01:15:53.862
And he stood up and aimed a rifle up in the
direction of officer Bariana's position...

01:15:53.929 --> 01:15:56.796
and fired, like,
four or five quick shots.

01:15:56.866 --> 01:15:59.164
Did Conrad
have a rifle or a gun...

01:15:59.235 --> 01:16:02.727
when he went out the garage door?

01:16:02.805 --> 01:16:04.102
Mm-mmm.

01:16:04.173 --> 01:16:06.232
What did he use
to open the bolt on the door?

01:16:06.308 --> 01:16:07.900
A big monkey wrench.

01:16:07.977 --> 01:16:09.535
A big monkey wrench?

01:16:09.612 --> 01:16:12.638
Are you certain it was a rifle and not a
monkey wrench or something of that nature?

01:16:12.715 --> 01:16:16.151
No, sir. When this-
I know a rifle, believe me.

01:16:16.218 --> 01:16:18.550
And when this male
pointed this rifle up,

01:16:18.621 --> 01:16:23.285
I- in other words, I could hear sound
and see muzzle flashes.

01:16:23.359 --> 01:16:27.295
Now, you say that some shooting started.
Did you hear shooting?

01:16:27.363 --> 01:16:29.593
It was a-

01:16:29.665 --> 01:16:31.565
Like it was just going after-

01:16:31.634 --> 01:16:35.195
Like it was going-Bullets were
going after each other. Like-

01:16:35.271 --> 01:16:37.364
Bullets were going
one right after the other.

01:16:37.439 --> 01:16:39.464
- Something like that?
- Yeah.

01:16:39.541 --> 01:16:42.339
Sergeant Griffiths, could you
just by rapping on the table...

01:16:42.411 --> 01:16:46.279
indicate the sound the best
you can recall of those shots?

01:16:46.348 --> 01:16:48.373
It was not automatic fire,
if that's what you're asking.

01:16:48.450 --> 01:16:51.180
Okay, could you just try and indicate
for me what it sounded like?

01:16:54.723 --> 01:16:58.159
Did you ever fire your weapons after the
bomb was dropped, officer Mulvihill?

01:16:58.227 --> 01:16:59.717
No, sir.

01:16:59.795 --> 01:17:02.821
- Officer D'Ulisse?
- No, sir.

01:17:02.898 --> 01:17:06.800
He had two officers taking him out,
and then they started shooting again,

01:17:06.869 --> 01:17:11.431
and then they brought him back in,
and then they locked the thing back up.

01:17:16.111 --> 01:17:18.443
Did you see the child
actually go back into the house?

01:17:18.514 --> 01:17:20.539
I believe the child
went back into the house.

01:17:20.616 --> 01:17:22.447
All right.

01:17:27.356 --> 01:17:31.850
Do you have any idea why that person
may have gone back into the fire?

01:17:31.927 --> 01:17:34.418
My own idea? What I think?

01:17:34.496 --> 01:17:35.986
Yes.

01:17:36.065 --> 01:17:40.297
I just think
they went back into that fire...

01:17:40.369 --> 01:17:42.269
sort of to regroup.

01:17:42.938 --> 01:17:45.031
Well,

01:17:45.107 --> 01:17:47.507
just as a human being myself...

01:17:49.278 --> 01:17:52.941
I'm just trying to imagine myself
in that situation...

01:17:53.015 --> 01:17:57.349
and behind me
there's a raging inferno...

01:17:57.419 --> 01:18:01.788
and in front of me there are people
who are saying "come on out."

01:18:02.725 --> 01:18:05.250
I'm trying to imagine...

01:18:05.327 --> 01:18:08.990
what would cause me
to turn back and run into the fire.

01:18:13.068 --> 01:18:16.731
I don't think we said anything
other than come down to us.

01:18:16.805 --> 01:18:18.295
Come on down
with your hands up-

01:18:18.374 --> 01:18:24.904
the normal police jargon
for calling the suspects to come down.

01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:26.743
Mm-hmm.

01:18:26.815 --> 01:18:29.978
I'm just saying that I'm trying to
put myself in that person's skin.

01:18:30.052 --> 01:18:33.180
Sir, I don't think you ever could.
These were MOVE members.

01:18:34.056 --> 01:18:37.890
Well, you see,

01:18:38.861 --> 01:18:43.059
I knew a lot of those people...

01:18:43.132 --> 01:18:45.692
as individuals
and as human beings.

01:18:45.768 --> 01:18:48.965
A lot of people know MOVE
from what they may have seen.

01:18:49.805 --> 01:18:51.932
But I had a lot of dealings with them,

01:18:52.007 --> 01:18:54.805
and I knew them to be more
than MOVE people.

01:18:54.877 --> 01:18:59.473
I knew many of them by name,
as human beings.

01:19:01.984 --> 01:19:03.645
It's probably
a rhetorical question.

01:19:03.719 --> 01:19:05.453
I don't think you, from
the way you've

01:19:05.466 --> 01:19:07.226
responded, I don't think
you can answer that.

01:19:07.289 --> 01:19:08.779
No, sir.

01:19:19.701 --> 01:19:21.931
And then
what happened to Tomaso?

01:19:22.004 --> 01:19:25.667
Rhonda was going like this on his back.

01:19:26.475 --> 01:19:29.035
- Rhonda had Tomaso?
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:29.111 --> 01:19:32.706
And she was hitting him
on his back?

01:19:32.781 --> 01:19:34.715
Was he crying then?

01:19:35.818 --> 01:19:37.649
He had stopped crying?

01:19:37.719 --> 01:19:39.687
Did you hear him cry anymore...

01:19:39.755 --> 01:19:42.349
after she was trying to pat him
and hit him on his back?

01:19:42.424 --> 01:19:44.153
Only one time.

01:19:44.226 --> 01:19:46.353
- And then what happened?
- He stopped.

01:19:46.428 --> 01:19:47.918
He stopped?

01:19:54.069 --> 01:19:56.003
And then what happened?

01:19:56.071 --> 01:20:00.235
I didn't hear nobody,
and I just ran out of there.

01:20:06.348 --> 01:20:08.543
Oh, my goodness.

01:20:09.785 --> 01:20:11.275
Well, Larry,

01:20:11.353 --> 01:20:15.915
the flames are probably
now leaping, um,

01:20:15.991 --> 01:20:18.391
uh, 10 stories high.

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:20.297
It just looked like something
was completely engulfed.

01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:22.157
What you're seeing now-

01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:25.098
You're telling me that the flames
are now leaping high?

01:20:39.148 --> 01:20:44.916
I remember Ramona coming from the rear of
the MOVE yard over the fence and down.

01:20:44.987 --> 01:20:47.421
She had started
to walk down, stopped.

01:20:47.489 --> 01:20:49.548
And she would wave
with her hand like this.

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:53.485
And then I see Birdie.

01:20:53.562 --> 01:20:56.793
The way I describe it, it looked like
he literally came through the fire.

01:20:58.066 --> 01:20:59.761
There was a board on fire there,

01:20:59.835 --> 01:21:03.430
and he hopped over that
and he started coming down.

01:21:03.505 --> 01:21:07.202
What did you see
when you first ran out of the house?

01:21:07.276 --> 01:21:08.834
I saw fire and stuff.

01:21:08.911 --> 01:21:10.879
You saw fire?
Where did you see the fire?

01:21:10.946 --> 01:21:13.540
The tree was on fire,
and the house was.

01:21:13.615 --> 01:21:15.634
And the house was on fire?
How about on the ground?

01:21:15.647 --> 01:21:17.676
Was anything on the
ground on fire?

01:21:17.753 --> 01:21:20.313
The pieces of the tree
was falling down.

01:21:20.389 --> 01:21:23.324
Pieces of fire from the tree
were falling down?

01:21:25.894 --> 01:21:29.955
Did the adults tell you what to do
if you all got out of the house?

01:21:30.032 --> 01:21:32.592
They told us to stay together.

01:21:34.303 --> 01:21:35.793
Ramona's up top.

01:21:35.871 --> 01:21:37.805
- She's on the walkway, the elevated walkway?
- That's right.

01:21:37.873 --> 01:21:39.602
Birdie's in the driveway.

01:21:39.675 --> 01:21:43.076
Now, as they're coming down,
Ramona's a little bit in the front.

01:21:43.145 --> 01:21:47.172
But at one time
does Ramona stop...

01:21:47.249 --> 01:21:52.881
and she goes over to the railing and
reached over and tried to pick Birdie up.

01:21:52.955 --> 01:21:55.685
He got I believe one foot,
maybe two, I don't know,

01:21:55.757 --> 01:22:00.023
on the bottom of the concrete wall
where the fence meets.

01:22:00.095 --> 01:22:01.255
Okay?

01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:03.525
And she either let go
or slipped or whatever.

01:22:03.599 --> 01:22:05.624
But Birdie fell back.
He went back.

01:22:05.701 --> 01:22:09.102
And I remember he didn't get a chance
to put his hands down to break his fall.

01:22:09.171 --> 01:22:11.901
The impression I was left with-
He landed square on his head.

01:22:15.143 --> 01:22:18.601
If you're watching somebody
or somebody falls...

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.046
and you hear a thud,

01:22:21.116 --> 01:22:23.175
you can almost feel it.

01:22:23.252 --> 01:22:25.777
That's the same sensation
I think we all got,

01:22:25.854 --> 01:22:28.823
that we knew Birdie
was hurt at this time.

01:22:28.890 --> 01:22:31.950
It was an actual feeling.
We could all feel it.

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.704
I remember Birdie just laying there,
not doing anything.

01:22:47.776 --> 01:22:50.609
I said, "Tommy, here. Take my shotgun."
I said, "I'm gonna go get the kid."

01:22:50.679 --> 01:22:53.239
And I remember him saying to me,
"I'll cover you."

01:22:53.315 --> 01:22:55.943
- Officer Mellor saying that?
- That's right.

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:03.254
At one point
did I start out to get Birdie,

01:23:03.325 --> 01:23:06.488
and that's the first time
I realized officer Tursi was behind me.

01:23:06.561 --> 01:23:10.520
He grabbed my left shoulder. He said,"
Don't go out there, Jim. It's a trap."

01:23:10.599 --> 01:23:12.226
What was your concern, officer?

01:23:12.301 --> 01:23:14.599
I don't know how to explain it
other than a sixth sense or something...

01:23:14.670 --> 01:23:18.037
that there was something wrong
in the way Ramona went down.

01:23:18.774 --> 01:23:22.335
I just felt something was incorrect
or not right about that situation.

01:23:22.411 --> 01:23:26.643
I stopped him from going out
right at that time. That's all.

01:23:26.715 --> 01:23:29.715
I was scared to death. I just didn't
wanna let that kid lay there like that.

01:23:33.622 --> 01:23:35.180
So what did you do?

01:23:35.257 --> 01:23:37.885
My priorities at that time were the kid.

01:23:38.894 --> 01:23:41.795
We're trying to say to him,
"Son, come over here. Come over here."

01:23:41.863 --> 01:23:43.888
We're trying to get him to come to us.

01:23:43.965 --> 01:23:46.593
This is the result
of officer Tursi saying be careful.

01:23:46.668 --> 01:23:48.323
"It's not right" or
something to that effect.

01:23:48.336 --> 01:23:50.001
"It doesn't feel right."

01:23:50.072 --> 01:23:52.097
inadvertently, Birdie gets up.

01:23:53.475 --> 01:23:56.376
I remember him taking a few steps
and went down in the water.

01:23:56.445 --> 01:23:57.935
He fell?

01:23:58.013 --> 01:23:59.952
I interpreted it as a fall
or stumble or whatever.

01:23:59.965 --> 01:24:01.915
As soon as he went
down in the water,

01:24:01.983 --> 01:24:05.009
at the same time that I seen that,
officer Tursi's right with me.

01:24:05.087 --> 01:24:07.214
I said,
"Mike, I'm getting the kid,"

01:24:07.289 --> 01:24:09.257
and he said,
"I got you covered."

01:24:10.926 --> 01:24:12.951
I remember I went in
underneath with my right hand,

01:24:13.028 --> 01:24:15.758
and I scooped him
underneath his left arm.

01:24:15.831 --> 01:24:18.299
Was his head
submerged under the water?

01:24:18.367 --> 01:24:20.767
I don't remember.
As soon as he hit the water, I went.

01:24:39.554 --> 01:24:41.488
I remember as soon
as I scooped him up,

01:24:41.556 --> 01:24:44.957
he said to me,
"Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me."

01:24:56.138 --> 01:25:00.666
When the police got you
after you finally got out,

01:25:00.742 --> 01:25:02.812
did they ask you anything
about whether or not

01:25:02.825 --> 01:25:04.906
there were any kids
still in the house...

01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:06.971
or were there any other
grown-ups still in the house?

01:25:07.048 --> 01:25:08.379
Yeah.

01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:10.884
- You said there were other kids still there?
- Mm-hmm.

01:25:10.952 --> 01:25:13.887
Do you remember who it was
who was still in the house?

01:25:13.955 --> 01:25:16.219
Tree,

01:25:16.291 --> 01:25:18.122
Netta,

01:25:18.193 --> 01:25:19.785
Tomaso and Melissa,

01:25:19.861 --> 01:25:21.556
Phil,

01:25:21.630 --> 01:25:25.122
and the big people
were Theresa, Rhonda,

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:27.168
Paul,

01:25:27.235 --> 01:25:29.669
Nick...

01:25:29.738 --> 01:25:31.706
and Rad and C.K.

01:26:08.143 --> 01:26:12.807
Ramona Africa, the MOVE spokesperson in
recent weeks, is in police custody tonight.

01:26:12.881 --> 01:26:15.145
She was captured
outside the MOVE compound...

01:26:15.217 --> 01:26:18.709
sometime after the massive fire
broke out there this afternoon.

01:26:18.787 --> 01:26:20.778
The child being treated
here at Children's...

01:26:20.856 --> 01:26:23.984
is suffering from second-and
third-degree burns on his arms and legs.

01:26:24.059 --> 01:26:27.379
All officials know at this point about his
identity is that his last name is Africa.

01:26:28.363 --> 01:26:30.490
All night long,
an increasing number of firemen...

01:26:30.565 --> 01:26:33.295
have been trying to battle
what is now a six-alarm blaze.

01:26:33.368 --> 01:26:36.166
There's a lot more water
being trained on it,

01:26:36.238 --> 01:26:39.435
but it looks as though this is going
to burn for a long, long time.

01:27:05.267 --> 01:27:07.258
We had a difficult problem.

01:27:08.303 --> 01:27:10.203
We made a difficult decision.

01:27:11.106 --> 01:27:15.042
It did not turn out as we intended.

01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:18.102
As we face the coming days,

01:27:18.179 --> 01:27:21.580
I ask your prayers for our city,

01:27:21.650 --> 01:27:24.619
for the homeless families...

01:27:24.686 --> 01:27:29.316
and for the families
of those who've lost lives.

01:27:54.115 --> 01:27:56.879
In the beginning, MOVE people...

01:27:56.952 --> 01:28:01.582
were the most happiest bunch
of people you could ever know.

01:28:01.656 --> 01:28:07.458
We were a family, peaceful, loving.

01:28:07.529 --> 01:28:10.020
And in the beginning,

01:28:10.098 --> 01:28:12.896
MOVE was harassed a great deal.

01:28:14.436 --> 01:28:19.032
We were beat many, many times.

01:28:20.141 --> 01:28:25.374
We were jailed
many, many times.

01:28:26.681 --> 01:28:30.014
And I'm talking about a people...

01:28:30.085 --> 01:28:33.680
who had feelings,

01:28:33.755 --> 01:28:36.189
who are no different than you or I.

01:28:54.042 --> 01:28:57.500
If the system can convict me
of riot and conspiracy...

01:28:57.579 --> 01:28:59.809
in a blatant situation like that...

01:28:59.881 --> 01:29:05.046
where it's obvious to everybody,
the whole world, that I did not riot,

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:08.578
then it should not be hard
to imagine at all...

01:29:08.657 --> 01:29:14.186
why and how this system convicted
nine people of murdering one cop.

01:29:14.262 --> 01:29:16.059
It's the same thing,

01:29:16.131 --> 01:29:19.862
that the system had one intention
in both confrontations,

01:29:19.934 --> 01:29:25.031
to either kill MOVE people
or to put us in prison as long as possible.

01:29:25.106 --> 01:29:26.937
It's just that simple.

01:29:37.585 --> 01:29:39.450
Was it like being in a war?

01:29:40.588 --> 01:29:44.490
There's just too many things are going on,
to sit here and just say how you felt.

01:29:44.559 --> 01:29:46.231
We felt-l thought about
the kids in the house.

01:29:46.244 --> 01:29:47.926
I thought about my kids.

01:29:47.996 --> 01:29:52.092
I thought about a lot of things.
But to sit here-l don't know.

01:29:52.167 --> 01:29:54.158
- I couldn't answer that.
- Mm-hmm.

01:29:56.971 --> 01:29:58.461
I am, uh-

01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:03.239
I've, uh, been sitting here
listening for many days...

01:30:04.746 --> 01:30:11.174
and I've read scores of pages
of reports and testimony.

01:30:11.252 --> 01:30:15.086
And it has all been. All of it.

01:30:15.156 --> 01:30:17.681
Uh, very depressing...

01:30:17.759 --> 01:30:20.023
and very discouraging...

01:30:20.095 --> 01:30:23.223
except what I've read
about officer Berghaier...

01:30:23.298 --> 01:30:26.290
and what I've heard
from officer Berghaier.

01:30:26.367 --> 01:30:31.168
And if there's any hope
in this whole sorry situation,

01:30:31.239 --> 01:30:32.973
it's because of that officer,
and I wanna thank him.

01:30:32.986 --> 01:30:34.731
Thank you, sir.

01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:01.100
I think you've done
such a good job.

01:31:01.169 --> 01:31:03.160
I'm gonna stop
my questions now,

01:31:03.238 --> 01:31:07.299
and I wanna thank you for taking all this
time to come in here and chat with us.

01:31:07.375 --> 01:31:09.605
That will bring a smile
to your face, won't it?

01:31:09.677 --> 01:31:11.668
And I wanna thank
your dad, Mr. Ward.

01:31:11.746 --> 01:31:13.941
- Thank you very much for your cooperation.
- You're quite welcome.

01:31:14.015 --> 01:31:15.983
- And Mr. Shrager, of course.
- Thank you.

01:31:16.050 --> 01:31:20.987
This will conclude
this deposition of testimony...

01:31:21.055 --> 01:31:24.149
of Michael, uh, Ward.

01:31:48.483 --> 01:31:50.474
As of today,

01:31:50.552 --> 01:31:54.147
you the people,
have all the principal facts...

01:31:55.056 --> 01:31:57.991
which tell the story
of the Osage Avenue tragedy.

01:31:59.227 --> 01:32:03.220
Rarely has any community
ever subjected itself...

01:32:03.298 --> 01:32:06.096
to a public self-appraisal...

01:32:06.167 --> 01:32:10.433
as painful and necessary
as this has been.

01:32:11.239 --> 01:32:14.902
But we believe that this process
is absolutely necessary...

01:32:14.976 --> 01:32:19.242
to prevent such a terrible thing
from ever happening again.

01:32:20.615 --> 01:32:24.415
And now I declare
these public hearings...

01:32:24.485 --> 01:32:27.613
to be in recess until further notice.
