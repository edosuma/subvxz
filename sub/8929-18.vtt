10:10.100 --> 10:13.000
And he sees the pod as his colony.

10:13.101 --> 10:15.468
Anyone who threatens it is his enemy.

10:15.568 --> 10:18.168

12:46.960 --> 12:48.559
The colony!

12:48.659 --> 12:49.926
Huh?

12:57.061 --> 13:00.728
It was the pod he was after all along.

13:00.828 --> 13:02.362
Buy why?

( groans )

13:09.296 --> 13:10.864
What happened?

13:10.964 --> 13:13.331
Predacons got here first.

13:13.431 --> 13:16.698
They've turned the protoform into one of them.

13:16.798 --> 13:17.965
And the pod?

13:18.065 --> 13:20.065
They must have taken it.

13:20.165 --> 13:22.899
I'll track them. Maybe I can retrieve it.

13:22.999 --> 13:25.433
Find Optimus. He must know of this.

13:25.533 --> 13:27.399
You might need backup.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.933
I hunt better alone.

13:31.200 --> 13:34.068
Or sometimes you can be too alone.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.973
Hmm. A stasis pod.

14:12.374 --> 14:14.974
( suspenseful theme playing )

14:22.976 --> 14:27.109
It's still after me. It's time to deal with him.

14:28.943 --> 14:31.444
Must find the colony.

15:40.955 --> 15:43.822
from that pod, Predacons.

15:50.023 --> 15:53.257
And you won't be getting any older, stripes.

15:57.258 --> 15:58.992
Huh?

15:59.092 --> 16:00.925
( laughs )

16:01.025 --> 16:02.459
( grunting )

16:08.159 --> 16:11.094
( Megatron growling )

16:11.193 --> 16:13.494
( roars )

16:15.194 --> 16:16.494
Oh, no!

16:19.262 --> 16:20.995
( gasps )

16:22.996 --> 16:26.296
Playtime's over, pussycat.

16:26.396 --> 16:28.129
Yes.

16:29.163 --> 16:32.197
Who's the first to sample my bite?

16:32.297 --> 16:33.764
( groans )

16:33.864 --> 16:36.231
( laughs ) ( Inferno roars )

16:36.331 --> 16:37.931
The colony!

16:38.031 --> 16:41.431
Whoever has done this thing will burn!

16:41.532 --> 16:44.699
Inferno, terrorize!

16:44.798 --> 16:47.766
( roaring )

16:49.833 --> 16:53.834
Ooh. I like him. Yes.

16:57.101 --> 17:00.601
Who has destroyed the colony? Who?

17:00.701 --> 17:03.235
He is the one! The Maximal!

17:03.335 --> 17:05.202
Destroy him!

17:05.302 --> 17:09.270
Ah, you will burn, Maximal!

17:09.370 --> 17:11.137
( dramatic theme playing )

17:16.170 --> 17:17.905
( Tigatron screams )

17:21.405 --> 17:25.106
Ha, I will destroy you and all your kind.

17:25.206 --> 17:26.540
( missile fires ) ( gasps )

17:26.640 --> 17:28.339
( roars )

17:34.440 --> 17:36.841
( dramatic theme playing )

17:39.108 --> 17:40.708
( Megatron grunts )

17:44.576 --> 17:46.209
( growls )

17:50.110 --> 17:53.677
Unh. Airazor suggested you might need a lift.

17:53.777 --> 17:58.144
That's another of my nine lives I owe her.

18:01.811 --> 18:04.012
Time to hit the wind.

18:09.146 --> 18:11.713
Unh! No! No!

18:11.813 --> 18:13.647
( growls )

18:16.781 --> 18:19.315
They're out of range, Megatron.

18:19.415 --> 18:21.248
( grunts )

18:21.348 --> 18:23.649
Gather up that junk pile and bring it to the base.

18:23.749 --> 18:25.949
Then find me those spiders.

18:26.049 --> 18:28.917
I want a few words with them.

18:29.017 --> 18:32.950
Defend the colony. Defend the colony.

18:33.050 --> 18:34.617
( voice distorted ): Defend the colony.

18:34.717 --> 18:36.450
( high-pitched ): Defend the colony.

18:36.551 --> 18:38.351
( normal voice ): Defend the colony.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.585
( mellow theme playing )

18:41.685 --> 18:44.252
RHINOX: Repair cycle complete.

18:56.154 --> 18:57.555
Feeling better?

18:57.655 --> 18:59.254
Extremely.

18:59.354 --> 19:01.289
I will return to my post.

19:01.389 --> 19:02.589
There's no hurry.

19:02.688 --> 19:05.055
Dinobot, Cheetor and Rattrap are out there.

19:05.155 --> 19:06.455
It is my duty.

19:06.556 --> 19:10.490
And to be honest, I prefer the wild land.

19:10.590 --> 19:13.090
Well, that's your privilege.

19:13.190 --> 19:14.823
But it wouldn't hurt

19:14.924 --> 19:17.191
to visit us now and then, would it?

19:17.291 --> 19:20.858
No, I-- I don't suppose it would.

19:20.958 --> 19:23.425
Farewell, my friends.

19:26.226 --> 19:28.426
( Tigatron growling )

19:28.526 --> 19:30.359
( door closes )

19:32.527 --> 19:34.527
( suspenseful theme playing )

19:37.460 --> 19:41.595
Oh, I must have been insane to help you.

19:41.695 --> 19:43.461
Megatron's gonna scrap us both.

19:43.562 --> 19:47.329
Megatron does not see the webs within the webs.

19:47.429 --> 19:48.796
Nor do you.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.664
Aw, don't be so testy.

19:51.764 --> 19:54.497
I meant nothing. We're two of a kind.

19:54.597 --> 19:55.931
We should stick together.

19:56.031 --> 19:58.031
It would make no difference if we did.

19:58.131 --> 20:00.531
This planet is doomed.

20:00.631 --> 20:03.199
So that's why you wanted the stasis pod.

20:03.299 --> 20:05.065
To build an escape ship.

20:05.165 --> 20:08.799
But how? Why? You must tell me.

20:08.899 --> 20:10.600
I can help.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.700
( chuckles )

20:12.800 --> 20:14.900
Leave my lair.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.234
Aw, at least consider it.

20:17.334 --> 20:19.401
We could be a great team.

20:19.501 --> 20:22.035
( chuckles )

20:22.135 --> 20:24.002
( whispers ): Lunatic.

20:25.468 --> 20:27.136
( whispers ): Witch.

20:27.236 --> 20:30.137
( laughing )

20:31.503 --> 20:33.571
( cackling )

20:35.737 --> 20:38.071
( dramatic rock theme playing )
