WEBVTT

02:49.202 --> 02:51.469
Good morning.

02:51.471 --> 02:52.805
Good morning.

02:56.242 --> 02:57.710
They're beautiful.

03:01.147 --> 03:02.782
So where do we go?

03:03.483 --> 03:04.817
Arizona?

03:05.318 --> 03:06.452
Nevada?

03:14.827 --> 03:16.529
A desert cabin...

03:18.064 --> 03:19.465
with a view.

03:22.235 --> 03:24.370
Far enough
we can't get caught.

04:28.901 --> 04:30.436
It's a sign.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.109
You sound
like your father.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.151
What is it?

05:18.851 --> 05:20.551
Carlota!

05:26.793 --> 05:29.429
It's over.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.217
So, what,
you won't listen to me?

05:53.219 --> 05:55.886
Never.
Do you understand me?
Never.

05:55.888 --> 05:57.890
You will never
have my permission.

05:58.424 --> 05:59.525
He's blood.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.061
I want you to say it.

06:03.162 --> 06:05.563
Now, go!
Move your head!

06:05.565 --> 06:06.666
Say it!

06:07.567 --> 06:09.502
I will never
have your permission.

06:12.138 --> 06:13.773
Do you understand me?

06:15.274 --> 06:17.143
I never want
to see you again.

06:20.246 --> 06:22.715
Please!
I said it. Please!
Enough.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.456
What are you
thinking?

06:31.190 --> 06:32.957
Ghost dance?

06:32.959 --> 06:34.859
Taking her
from her family?

06:34.861 --> 06:37.563
Some things
just ain't for this life,
Willie Boy.

07:18.471 --> 07:21.674
My girl,
we have to go.

07:34.754 --> 07:37.588
Soon, this will
all be a memory.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.090
The horses should be resting
during the hottest part
of the day,

07:40.092 --> 07:41.527
not starting out.
Let's go.

07:42.261 --> 07:43.663
Come on.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.432
Carlota. Hey.

07:48.434 --> 07:49.733
Carlota.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.540
Desert heat
we can handle.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.309
Today we suffer
because of you.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.945
She ran away
with her cousin.
Fifth generation.

08:00.947 --> 08:03.747
Oh, what, you too? Hmm?

08:03.749 --> 08:06.083
What happened
to our tradition, Maria?
Tradition?

08:06.085 --> 08:09.920
Like picking fruit
for some white rancher?
That tradition?

08:09.922 --> 08:11.956
Things change, William.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.891
We're changing.

08:13.893 --> 08:16.594
Look around. We're 26
in this village now.

08:16.596 --> 08:19.997
Tradition won't find
her a husband.
Okay. Enough, Maria.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.500
If you are going
to remove this family
weeks before we planned,

08:22.502 --> 08:25.338
you will wait
until this family
is ready to say goodbye.

08:26.305 --> 08:28.639
The Indian Agency woman.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.641
No, stay here.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.576
You don't need another woman
telling you what to do.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.645
Hey, I need peace
between us.

08:34.647 --> 08:38.150
Bring us peace.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.063
Candy, candy.
Candy.

08:53.065 --> 08:54.932
She has candy.

08:54.934 --> 08:56.967
Okay, settle down.

08:56.969 --> 09:00.704
That's not a way
to welcome me.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.073
- That's not a way to welcome me.
-  I fall.

09:03.075 --> 09:04.608
What?
I fell.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.944
Oh, I'm so sorry.
You fell down?

09:06.946 --> 09:09.513
Would some candy
make you feel better?

09:09.515 --> 09:10.748
What do you say?

09:10.750 --> 09:12.516
Please.
And?

09:12.518 --> 09:13.651
Thank you.

09:13.653 --> 09:14.854
Yay!

09:17.857 --> 09:18.991
Thank you.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.163
You're leaving
already.

09:26.165 --> 09:28.966
Harvest isn't
for another month.

09:28.968 --> 09:30.336
Yes, that's true.

09:31.837 --> 09:35.007
Well, then,
I came just in time.

09:36.542 --> 09:37.910
This was my mother's.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.449
She was fiery
and passionate
like you.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.786
So I wanted you
to have it.

09:55.027 --> 09:56.195
Thank you.

10:43.442 --> 10:45.811
Hurry, hurry.
We have to catch him.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.016
Grandma said
he's a desert runner.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.686
He can go on for days.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.525
We'll never catch up
to him.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.497
How did he get there
so fast?

11:22.014 --> 11:23.580
Goddamn it!

11:23.582 --> 11:27.918
Get your hands off me,
you fucking Philistine!

11:31.457 --> 11:32.923
Don't move!

11:32.925 --> 11:34.758
Take him to jail to cool off.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.002
Hyah!

13:56.335 --> 13:58.637
Take those
to the other one.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.641
Good morning, Ticup.

14:03.609 --> 14:05.609
Miss True.

14:05.611 --> 14:09.580
I've brought some donations
left over from the Malki Agency.

14:09.582 --> 14:14.486
I thought maybe
you and your grandson
would want some new clothes?

14:18.757 --> 14:20.292
Is Willie Boy in?

14:21.794 --> 14:26.198
He and I have never
met each other, but Carlota
speaks so fondly of him.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.804
I understand he spends
most of his time
in the desert,

14:33.806 --> 14:37.941
but I thought
maybe he'd like
a few of these things.

14:37.943 --> 14:40.212
I'll just leave them
over here.

14:43.415 --> 14:44.783
Good day.

15:44.009 --> 15:46.743
Stopping early
for ceremony tonight.

15:46.745 --> 15:48.314
Someone die?

15:49.415 --> 15:51.348
A man from Riverside.

15:51.350 --> 15:52.985
No one sung for him.

15:56.422 --> 15:57.756
Hey.

16:00.025 --> 16:01.260
What happened?

16:01.827 --> 16:02.928
I made a mistake.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.303
I just made some tincture.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.940
Go talk to your mother.

16:29.621 --> 16:32.055
I want to say thank you.

16:32.057 --> 16:35.192
Thank you all
for coming here today.

16:35.194 --> 16:38.795
You know, our creator...

16:38.797 --> 16:43.300
...- he gave us...
- ...the Salt Songs,

16:43.302 --> 16:45.068
to guide our spirits
to the coyote

16:45.070 --> 16:48.040
who made the staircase
into the Milky Way.

16:49.608 --> 16:54.044
The creator also gave us
these songs to ease
our suffering.

16:54.046 --> 16:57.314
But on the day that he was
to deliver them to us,

16:57.316 --> 17:01.651
he warned us that he must
first break our hearts.

17:01.653 --> 17:05.022
'Cause this is how we learn
those Salt Songs.

17:08.961 --> 17:13.665
And in suffering,
we learn true happiness.

17:15.567 --> 17:19.036
In hearts that break,
we find life,

17:19.038 --> 17:23.042
- and in...
- ...we find the Salt Songs.

17:58.710 --> 18:00.844
Are you guys ready for a story?

18:00.846 --> 18:07.653
Okay, I want to tell you a story
and warn you about
the legendary John Hyde.

18:08.987 --> 18:11.354
He's the best tracker
in the West.

18:11.356 --> 18:15.525
He's quiet as a mouse,
but he's got the eyes of a hawk.

18:15.527 --> 18:17.394
You know what he did one time?

18:17.396 --> 18:20.497
He attacked
the customs house in Nogales,
killing several men.

18:20.499 --> 18:26.870
He got American militia,
he got the Mexican infantry,
Buffalo soldiers.

18:26.872 --> 18:28.472
- Guess what.
- What?

18:28.474 --> 18:31.041
Now he's taken refuge
right here in the desert,

18:31.043 --> 18:33.076
and he's protecting
me and you.

18:33.078 --> 18:38.682
But at night,
sleep with one eye open.

18:38.684 --> 18:40.951
Because you know
what John Hyde does?

18:40.953 --> 18:43.820
He sneaks around

18:43.822 --> 18:45.322
and eats
little kids!

18:47.926 --> 18:49.294
I'm just teasing.

18:50.162 --> 18:51.995
John Hyde is my friend.

18:51.997 --> 18:53.797
- I scare you, huh?
- Yeah.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.301
That's good.
I meant to scare you.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.470
Here.

19:00.539 --> 19:03.540
You're the chief now.
Okay?

19:03.542 --> 19:05.077
You take over my spot.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.324
Carlota!

20:00.165 --> 20:01.366
Carlota!

20:03.202 --> 20:04.903
You going somewhere?

20:11.443 --> 20:13.478
Are they worth it,
Carlota?

20:15.447 --> 20:16.548
Carlota.

20:19.818 --> 20:22.421
I want you to think about
what you're doing.

20:28.293 --> 20:29.626
- Carlota.
- William.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.228
- Carlota!
- William, no more.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.964
No. No.
I know he's out there.
I said no more.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.666
Just leave her be.
Leave her be, Maria?

20:36.668 --> 20:38.904
She's my daughter.
She's my daughter too.

20:40.439 --> 20:43.206
William, you keep pushing her,
you're only gonna push her
further away.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.409
No.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.610
No, no.

20:46.612 --> 20:49.214
William!
No, no. No.

20:50.349 --> 20:51.650
Carlota!

20:52.951 --> 20:54.253
Carlota!

20:56.288 --> 20:57.589
Carlota!

21:18.243 --> 21:19.811
A gun.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.815
What, you brought
a gun to talk to me?

21:29.154 --> 21:30.587
You scared now?

21:30.589 --> 21:33.723
Where is she?
Well, I was hoping that maybe--

21:33.725 --> 21:36.094
This what you came to do?
Hmm?

21:38.563 --> 21:40.196
Then do it. Do it. Do it.

21:40.198 --> 21:42.032
Yeah.
If you want to take her...
Dad.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.802
...you're gonna
have to kill me.
No. Please.

21:45.203 --> 21:46.770
Come on. Come on!
No, no, no!

21:46.772 --> 21:47.771
Dad!
No!

21:47.773 --> 21:49.441
No!

21:52.744 --> 21:54.513
What have you done?

21:56.415 --> 21:58.248
William.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.684
- It was an accident.
- William!

22:00.686 --> 22:03.887
Mama! Mama, no.
I'm so sorry.

22:03.889 --> 22:06.923
Leave us.

22:06.925 --> 22:08.325
Mama?

22:08.327 --> 22:10.627
Leave us!

22:10.629 --> 22:12.130
They'll be coming
for you.

22:15.133 --> 22:16.268
Go!

23:12.891 --> 23:15.060
Please. Please.

23:48.293 --> 23:49.428
Sheriff?

23:50.662 --> 23:51.897
Nope.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.398
This is his home.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.066
Oh, yeah.

23:57.068 --> 23:58.802
Where is he?

23:58.804 --> 24:02.274
Uh...
on sabbatical.

24:03.074 --> 24:05.041
Can I help you?

24:05.043 --> 24:07.510
William was shot last night.

24:07.512 --> 24:10.513
He-- He's dead.

24:10.515 --> 24:13.418
- Your husband?
- Killed.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.720
Oh, Jesus.

24:17.022 --> 24:18.688
He was a good man.

24:18.690 --> 24:20.723
Kept Indian trouble
on Indian land.

24:20.725 --> 24:23.693
You're gonna have to talk
to the tribal police.

24:23.695 --> 24:26.665
The man who shot my husband
is with my daughter.

24:27.599 --> 24:29.399
Tribal police will kill him.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.167
You need to help her.

24:31.169 --> 24:35.205
The government gave you
land and life
outside our laws.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.707
You gotta talk to
the tribal police.
It's beyond our protection.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.943
My husband was shot
on Gilman's ranch.

24:39.945 --> 24:41.945
That puts this
in your jurisdiction.

24:41.947 --> 24:45.048
Oh, okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.449
Why don't you go home?

24:46.451 --> 24:48.251
Just go on home.
Mm-mmm.

24:48.253 --> 24:50.622
I'm not leaving
until I see him.

24:55.293 --> 24:57.195
I'm sorry
about the chief.

25:12.043 --> 25:14.644
I thought I told you
to hide the liquor.

25:14.646 --> 25:17.580
He wouldn't
listen to me.
I tried to stop him.

25:19.918 --> 25:21.152
Wake up, buddy.

25:23.388 --> 25:24.454
Frank?

25:24.456 --> 25:27.392
Oh, no. Reche.

25:29.828 --> 25:31.530
Put me down, Reche.

25:33.298 --> 25:34.666
I'm fine.

An Indian killed
one of its own.

26:20.378 --> 26:22.045
Not our problem.

26:22.047 --> 26:23.148
Okay.

26:25.984 --> 26:28.251
It happened
at Gilman's ranch.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.455
Gilman's ranch? Shit.

26:33.725 --> 26:35.992
Brother.
Brother, brother.

26:35.994 --> 26:38.263
We gotta get our
shit together, man.

26:39.531 --> 26:41.331
Taft is coming
to Riverside.

26:41.333 --> 26:42.565
Taft?
Yeah.

26:42.567 --> 26:45.101
Some presidential
jerk-off bullshit.

26:45.103 --> 26:48.607
Nobody's gonna like a manhunt,
not while that's going on.

26:50.909 --> 26:54.045
Brother,
we got a posse to mount.

28:21.332 --> 28:23.234
Aren't they
supposed to burn the body?

28:24.035 --> 28:25.704
Just his possessions.

28:58.002 --> 28:59.904
You did smart
going to the sheriff.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.110
We'll make it right
in the end.

29:06.144 --> 29:07.779
Will you?

29:15.019 --> 29:18.456
It smells a bone,
it comes running.

29:21.559 --> 29:23.693
Please tell me
he's not riding out with us.

29:23.695 --> 29:24.796
Shut up.

29:25.663 --> 29:27.265
They don't need those men.

29:29.601 --> 29:33.638
I didn't ask them here
to help you and Hyde
find Willie Boy.

29:36.574 --> 29:38.676
They're here
in case you do.

29:41.980 --> 29:44.981
Big Jim, you stay here.

29:44.983 --> 29:48.417
Keep an eye on that town
and a closer eye on the tribe.

29:48.419 --> 29:51.220
These kids might try
to make their way back.

29:51.222 --> 29:53.322
You're gonna need
more water.

29:53.324 --> 29:54.626
They'll be
all right.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.560
I'm talking about
the horses.

29:57.562 --> 30:00.296
You gonna let the bastard
talk to you like that?

30:00.298 --> 30:01.731
Stop talking.

30:12.944 --> 30:15.044
Pack of Sasquatches.

30:15.046 --> 30:16.447
Show some respect.

30:17.382 --> 30:19.649
Holy shit.
You hearing this?

30:19.651 --> 30:22.552
What's gotten into you?
I didn't ask you to speak.

30:22.554 --> 30:26.055
Enough. Enough.
So don't speak.

30:26.057 --> 30:29.091
Nobody wants to hear lip
from some wannabe savage

30:29.093 --> 30:30.960
raised on some
white witch's tit.

30:34.032 --> 30:37.035
Geez.
Where'd that come from?

30:40.905 --> 30:42.774
You got a reckoning coming.

30:46.110 --> 30:48.211
Is that so,
monkey boy?

30:48.213 --> 30:51.149
You sweet on Frank.
That's why he keeps you around.

30:55.787 --> 30:59.257
Sheriff,
boys are waiti''
on the word.

31:02.961 --> 31:04.729
She ain't talking,
huh?

31:08.800 --> 31:11.369
Come on. Let's go.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.267
See any tracks up there?

32:50.101 --> 32:51.202
No.

32:52.370 --> 32:54.403
Kid threw us in a loop.

32:54.405 --> 32:56.474
Better than I thought.

32:59.210 --> 33:00.945
That horse do
the same for you?

33:01.746 --> 33:03.481
Yeah, he would.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.951
Stupid.

33:14.459 --> 33:16.060
That horse looks thirsty.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.295
So does that one.

33:19.297 --> 33:22.832
Can someone please tell me
how two two-footed redskins

33:22.834 --> 33:25.001
beat a posse
of four-footed horsemen?

33:25.003 --> 33:26.802
Horses ain't got
much left in 'em.

33:26.804 --> 33:29.238
We're gonna have to head back.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.374
I ain't following
no desert dogs.

33:31.376 --> 33:34.178
We need to find a place
to pack up for the night.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.413
This place looks good.

33:37.415 --> 33:39.550
Do they know
something we don't?

33:41.586 --> 33:43.087
I hope so.

34:59.664 --> 35:02.800
That Indian
been watching us
about an hour now.

35:04.168 --> 35:07.438
Never did give you
my condolences
for your wife, Frank.

35:08.239 --> 35:10.174
How you sleeping?

35:20.017 --> 35:21.450
Are you Hyde?

35:21.452 --> 35:22.651
Would be.

35:22.653 --> 35:23.819
Segundo.

35:23.821 --> 35:25.523
Frank Wilson.

35:32.263 --> 35:35.764
Um, that's, uh, Toutain
on the rocks back there,

35:35.766 --> 35:40.202
and Reche, my tracker,
and Knowlin on the harmonica.

35:40.204 --> 35:43.274
He's a utility.

35:44.242 --> 35:47.145
And Ben de Crevecoeur,
um,

35:47.745 --> 35:48.980
he's just an asshole.

35:50.248 --> 35:53.516
We underestimated
our time out here.
Horses are thirsty.

35:53.518 --> 35:55.720
You know
where there's water?

35:57.054 --> 35:59.388
Juniper Pond
would be your best chance.

35:59.390 --> 36:01.292
Can you take us there?

36:07.698 --> 36:08.799
Yeah.

36:10.234 --> 36:11.502
Well, thank you.

36:15.806 --> 36:16.941
Let's go.

36:38.996 --> 36:42.133
You trust
old Crazy Horse
up there?

36:42.667 --> 36:43.999
No.

36:44.001 --> 36:46.669
But until my tracker
finds us some water,

36:46.671 --> 36:48.239
we don't got a choice.

37:09.627 --> 37:11.262
Where's the water?

37:12.797 --> 37:15.164
Desert drank it up.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.902
Unbelievable.

37:19.437 --> 37:20.970
Fell for that one,
Sheriff?

37:20.972 --> 37:23.341
Is there another source
nearby?

37:24.642 --> 37:26.342
About a day's ride.

37:26.344 --> 37:27.712
I knew it.

37:30.348 --> 37:33.584
You did this on purpose,
you redback son of a bitch.

37:34.552 --> 37:37.319
Dragged us out here,
no water,

37:37.321 --> 37:40.024
forcing us back
so you can find them
on your own.

37:40.891 --> 37:43.127
Ain't gonna work, though.
No, sir.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.263
Come on.

37:46.697 --> 37:48.063
Where the hell you going?

37:48.065 --> 37:49.865
- Back.
- Back?

37:49.867 --> 37:53.104
Back for supplies and water.
We don't have a choice.

37:53.838 --> 37:55.571
What about them?

37:55.573 --> 37:59.310
Pack up what you need.
Pick up our trail
in Pipes Canyon.

38:00.578 --> 38:03.746
Frank, one of us
needs to go with them

38:03.748 --> 38:05.714
and make sure they're not
screwing us around.

38:05.716 --> 38:07.583
- I'll go.
- Not you.

38:07.585 --> 38:09.285
I ain't following no redskin.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.753
I'll do it.

38:10.755 --> 38:12.721
No, to hell with it.
I'll go.

38:12.723 --> 38:15.459
I get up to see this through,
I'm gonna see it through.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.295
No horse.

38:18.529 --> 38:20.362
Two days.
Pipes Canyon.

38:20.364 --> 38:21.599
Right.

38:23.834 --> 38:25.934
Y'all better hurry.

38:25.936 --> 38:28.572
I'll have Willie Boy
hog-tied and mounted
time you get back.

38:29.573 --> 38:32.441
All right, chimmies.
Show us what you got.

38:32.443 --> 38:37.413
You're like a couple of
desert hound dogs, ain't you?

38:43.954 --> 38:45.856
Knowlin
don't stand a chance.

40:13.544 --> 40:14.712
Gentlemen!

40:23.387 --> 40:24.622
It's just a camera.

40:25.823 --> 40:28.926
Wanted to ask you
a few questions
about Willie Boy.

40:30.828 --> 40:32.795
You got a comment
for the paper, Sheriff?

40:32.797 --> 40:34.265
We leave in the morning.

40:37.168 --> 40:41.238
Oh. Anything else?
No.

41:30.054 --> 41:32.056
Newspaperman.

41:41.432 --> 41:43.067
Mr. Randolph Madison.

41:44.902 --> 41:48.937
So what's a newspaperman
doing out in
this goddamn sandbox?

41:48.939 --> 41:51.275
I'm gonna need a story.

41:52.109 --> 41:53.677
I got one for you.

41:57.181 --> 41:58.482
Here you go.

42:01.385 --> 42:03.387
The marks in the dirt

42:04.588 --> 42:08.257
sayin' he proddin' her on
like a stray heifer,

42:08.259 --> 42:11.960
probably with
a loaded rifle to her back.

42:11.962 --> 42:13.495
We was close too.

42:13.497 --> 42:17.902
Heard her crying, moaning.

42:20.170 --> 42:23.405
How's that for a story?
You can read
the whole thing tomorrow.

42:23.407 --> 42:25.274
Already have,
Mr. Crevecoeur.

42:25.276 --> 42:27.075
Great story.

42:27.077 --> 42:29.811
Willie Boy is gonna be
everyone's worst nightmare.

42:29.813 --> 42:33.284
Ah. Fear really is
the best kind of candy.

42:35.119 --> 42:37.986
The thing is... Well--

42:37.988 --> 42:39.089
What?

42:41.492 --> 42:44.528
You lack
a grand ending.
Oh, that's coming.

42:45.496 --> 42:48.931
I assure you, Mr. Randolph,
that's coming.

42:48.933 --> 42:50.465
When?

42:50.467 --> 42:57.005
You see,
it's a matter of perspective.

42:57.007 --> 42:59.743
You gave us a great villain
in Willie Boy.

43:00.611 --> 43:03.213
But who's the hero?

43:04.348 --> 43:05.849
Oh, is it Sheriff Wilson?

43:07.885 --> 43:11.320
The drunk who couldn't even
save his wife
from a rusty blade.

43:11.322 --> 43:13.057
He, our hero?

43:15.059 --> 43:16.727
Or is it someone else?

43:20.864 --> 43:25.867
Maybe it's a man
whose family was evicted
by US troops

43:25.869 --> 43:28.737
when the Malki Reservation
was established.

43:28.739 --> 43:33.811
A man who one day might be--
should be sheriff.

43:34.845 --> 43:37.879
My story will need a hero.

43:37.881 --> 43:39.881
What's your angle,
Mr. Randolph?

43:39.883 --> 43:42.751
We'll plug you in every paper
across these deserts

43:42.753 --> 43:45.887
until news burns
across California state lines.

43:45.889 --> 43:48.323
The worse Willie Boy gets,
the better you sound.

43:48.325 --> 43:50.227
Papers gonna fly
off these shelves.

43:54.331 --> 43:55.799
I will ask again.

43:57.334 --> 43:59.534
What's in it for you?

43:59.536 --> 44:02.371
I need Sheriff Wilson
to bring me along.

44:02.373 --> 44:05.173
It's the only way
the story's getting written.

44:05.175 --> 44:08.577
And, well,
it's the only way

44:08.579 --> 44:11.982
that I get to get out
of this goddamn sandbox.

44:40.210 --> 44:42.177
There's more of these
along the way.

44:42.179 --> 44:43.781
All the way to Nevada.

44:55.993 --> 44:58.627
Hey, Frank.
I got an idea.

44:58.629 --> 45:00.962
Why don't you give
your horse your house?

45:00.964 --> 45:03.465
Then you can have
your horse's stall
all to yourself.

45:03.467 --> 45:05.267
Mm-hmm.

45:05.269 --> 45:06.435
Sheriff?

45:06.437 --> 45:07.969
Where the fuck
did you come from?

45:07.971 --> 45:10.172
A moment of your time,
Sheriff?

45:10.174 --> 45:13.275
My name is Randolph Madison.
I'm with the Banning Daily .

45:13.277 --> 45:15.644
No, no, no.
Get him out of here.
Why?

45:15.646 --> 45:17.612
He put our story
on the front page.

45:17.614 --> 45:19.281
Publication's
making us look stupid.

45:19.283 --> 45:22.517
Us stupid? You, maybe.

45:22.519 --> 45:26.521
All due respect, Sheriff,
but there's a murderous Indian
on the loose

45:26.523 --> 45:30.025
and we are days away
from President Taft
from riding into Riverside.

45:30.027 --> 45:31.493
That's a lot
at stake here, sir.

45:31.495 --> 45:33.195
Uh-huh.

45:33.197 --> 45:35.697
Sheriff, if you all
come back again
with nothing,

45:35.699 --> 45:39.835
the people will soon
become scrutinizing
and judgmental and unsupportive.

45:39.837 --> 45:42.037
People will think that you
can't do the job, Sheriff.

45:42.039 --> 45:44.806
And we can't have
the public turn on us.

45:44.808 --> 45:46.708
Us?
Like he's saying.

45:46.710 --> 45:48.545
How you gonna help us?

45:49.146 --> 45:50.345
Huh?

45:50.347 --> 45:52.547
Fear, Mr. Reche.
Huh?

45:52.549 --> 45:54.683
Think about it,
Sheriff.

45:54.685 --> 45:58.220
If people are afraid of
what it means to have
Willie Boy on the loose,

45:58.222 --> 46:01.556
they will rally behind us
no matter how long
it takes to bring him in.

46:01.558 --> 46:03.792
With no story,
no fear.

46:03.794 --> 46:07.295
The public will think
that it's you that can't
do the job, Sheriff,

46:07.297 --> 46:09.231
and then there'll be
queries as to why.

46:09.233 --> 46:13.201
And, Sheriff, well,
word around town is that

46:13.203 --> 46:15.637
one shouldn't dig too deep
into your past.

46:15.639 --> 46:17.205
You son of a bitch!

46:17.207 --> 46:19.207
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Come on, Reche.

46:19.209 --> 46:22.713
What's your fucking game,
Randolph?

46:23.914 --> 46:25.380
Do that again!

46:25.382 --> 46:27.818
What's your game, brother?
Wanna tell me?

46:29.553 --> 46:31.455
- Get off!
- Enough.

46:32.890 --> 46:33.991
No games.

46:35.259 --> 46:39.396
I need you for a story,
and you need me to buy you time.

46:40.697 --> 46:42.332
It's all we got.

46:46.069 --> 46:47.638
All right, Mr. Madison.

46:49.706 --> 46:50.941
Okay.

46:53.911 --> 46:55.946
Back to work.

46:58.048 --> 47:01.449
Hey, Ben,
you have anything
to do with this?

47:01.451 --> 47:03.084
Nope.

47:03.086 --> 47:05.287
How'd he know
where to find us?

47:14.498 --> 47:15.999
Let's get to it.

47:32.983 --> 47:35.185
Don't you chimmies
ever need a break?

47:44.995 --> 47:46.096
A box.

47:49.333 --> 47:50.467
Lunch.

47:58.742 --> 47:59.843
I can't--

48:01.845 --> 48:03.347
Son of a bitch!

48:21.198 --> 48:22.399
You okay?

48:24.868 --> 48:26.270
I'm fine.

49:12.215 --> 49:14.418
Do you think
anyone's following us?

49:16.286 --> 49:18.455
No,
I don't think so.

50:16.146 --> 50:17.412
Let's go.

50:30.460 --> 50:31.561
Hey.

50:32.129 --> 50:33.230
Hey.

50:34.998 --> 50:36.133
Hey.

50:37.300 --> 50:38.402
Hey.

50:41.838 --> 50:45.073
There he is.

50:45.075 --> 50:46.908
Ah, Jesus.

50:46.910 --> 50:48.545
Water! Hurry up!

50:52.015 --> 50:54.449
Make some room. In the back.

50:54.451 --> 50:56.420
Come on.
Let's go.

50:57.154 --> 50:58.753
Come on, Knowlin.

50:58.755 --> 51:00.455
We got you.

51:03.493 --> 51:06.161
Indians are right over there
just looking at him.

51:06.163 --> 51:08.630
This way.
Get him in the wagon.
Come on.

51:08.632 --> 51:11.501
The trackers
are coming with us.

51:39.062 --> 51:41.062
We'll sleep here
tonight.

51:41.064 --> 51:44.701
Animals will come to drink.
We can trap some food.

51:52.008 --> 51:53.443
Shouldn't we
keep moving?

51:54.578 --> 51:57.647
If anyone's following us,
they'll be a day behind.

51:58.248 --> 51:59.382
We're okay.

52:23.740 --> 52:25.106
Segundo.

52:25.108 --> 52:26.209
Hmm?

52:27.110 --> 52:28.910
Why are you here?

52:35.252 --> 52:36.987
Bring Carlota home.

52:39.456 --> 52:41.024
Only Carlota?

52:44.161 --> 52:45.295
Yeah.

52:51.101 --> 52:52.836
Beans are bubbling.

52:55.405 --> 52:58.308
I thought them Indians
left me for dead.

53:01.444 --> 53:03.313
Then I heard the wagon.

53:06.783 --> 53:08.018
They knew.

53:09.252 --> 53:11.655
That's why I'm still alive.

53:13.924 --> 53:14.991
Why?

53:16.159 --> 53:17.561
Because
they're good people.

53:19.963 --> 53:22.830
Mr. Toutain,
I heard from Reche

53:22.832 --> 53:27.135
that you-- that you grew up
on an Indian reservation.

53:27.137 --> 53:29.539
You sympathize
with the Indian?

53:30.840 --> 53:32.142
He preaches to 'em.

53:33.610 --> 53:35.879
Why don't you just
paint your face red,

53:36.813 --> 53:39.583
join their damn team,
for Christ's sake.

53:40.684 --> 53:42.419
Who are the savages?

53:44.487 --> 53:47.424
Indian lovin'
don't make you smart,
Toutain.

53:48.425 --> 53:50.994
Makes you
a fool's preacher.

54:57.794 --> 54:58.962
Good morning.

55:07.604 --> 55:09.771
Meat's
a bit tough.

55:16.846 --> 55:18.379
Carlota!

55:18.381 --> 55:21.117
No.

55:23.620 --> 55:25.655
Let me see,
let me see-- Oh.

55:29.092 --> 55:32.662
It'll be okay. Just breathe.
There's a good chance
it's a dry bite.

55:34.397 --> 55:37.065
There's a hunter's cabin
not far ahead.

55:37.067 --> 55:39.300
There should be
some supplies,
maybe some medicine.

55:39.302 --> 55:41.736
Don't panic.
It will just
make it worse.

55:41.738 --> 55:44.007
Come on, come on.
Let's go.

55:59.823 --> 56:04.394
You know why the Chemehuevi
burn the possessions
of the ones who've died?

56:07.163 --> 56:10.200
It rids them of
their attachments

56:11.401 --> 56:13.737
and lets the spirit
run free.

56:17.340 --> 56:19.776
I know my sister's death
haunts you, Frank.

56:21.177 --> 56:23.847
But maybe we're the ones
haunting her...

56:25.014 --> 56:27.150
holding on the way we do.

56:35.191 --> 56:36.693
Eat something.

56:55.145 --> 56:56.112
Hey, sir.

56:57.380 --> 57:00.381
Load up.
We're gonna head over
to Garth's place.

57:00.383 --> 57:03.151
There's a well there.
Ten minutes.

57:03.153 --> 57:04.554
Yes, boss.

57:13.830 --> 57:15.064
Morning.

57:21.304 --> 57:23.070
The thing is,

57:23.072 --> 57:27.710
my men and I are here
to bring that boy in alive.

57:28.711 --> 57:31.045
So if you're here
on some sort of vendetta,

57:31.047 --> 57:33.483
that's liable
to complicate things.

57:34.150 --> 57:35.985
You hear me?

57:38.555 --> 57:40.588
I will find him,

57:40.590 --> 57:44.258
and you're welcome
to every piece of him
when I'm done.

57:44.260 --> 57:45.528
You hear me?

57:47.697 --> 57:51.098
What's a Yaqui doing
with the Chemehuevi?

57:51.100 --> 57:54.235
I hoped William
would take you in...

57:56.272 --> 57:58.942
...make you forget about
all the horrible things
that you've seen.

58:00.610 --> 58:03.980
But peace doesn't follow death,
does it?

58:04.581 --> 58:06.015
Booze does.

58:15.358 --> 58:16.759
You, move.

58:19.362 --> 58:20.597
Ah, Jesus.

58:49.959 --> 58:51.528
You want
some more water?

58:52.328 --> 58:53.563
This cabin.

58:54.597 --> 58:56.764
It's like Pahrump.

58:56.766 --> 58:58.701
A cabin with a view.

59:13.449 --> 59:18.152
Toutain, keep an eye on them.
Reche, head on up.

59:18.154 --> 59:20.121
There's a trail
around the north side.

59:20.123 --> 59:22.523
Looks like they
picked up something.

59:22.525 --> 59:24.027
I'm on it.

59:30.033 --> 59:31.499
You holding up?

59:31.501 --> 59:34.370
I'm done.

59:36.406 --> 59:38.675
I'm seeing some
tracks over here.

59:39.442 --> 59:40.977
Get that camera loaded.

59:56.793 --> 59:58.261
Son of a bitch.

1:00:02.031 --> 1:00:05.101
Well's busted.
He broke the damn handle.

1:00:06.002 --> 1:00:07.201
Can you fix it?

1:00:07.203 --> 1:00:09.003
Hell, no.

1:00:09.005 --> 1:00:10.239
How long?

1:00:10.873 --> 1:00:12.740
A matter of hours.

1:00:12.742 --> 1:00:15.242
We gotta stop
dicking around and end this.

1:00:15.244 --> 1:00:18.646
- Stop talking.
-  The trail leads to a place we know.

1:00:18.648 --> 1:00:20.381
It'll push the horses,
but there's water.

1:00:20.383 --> 1:00:22.883
You ain't leading us
to water, are you?

1:00:22.885 --> 1:00:25.553
You're just wearing
them horses out.

1:00:25.555 --> 1:00:27.588
Am I?
Yeah, you are.

1:00:27.590 --> 1:00:30.358
Your horses carry
the scent of death
not because of me.

1:00:30.360 --> 1:00:33.429
It's because you wander
around this desert
like a bunch of children.

1:00:37.367 --> 1:00:39.100
Y'all gonna let him
draw on me?

1:00:39.102 --> 1:00:41.170
I told you to stop talking.

1:00:42.939 --> 1:00:46.843
Put it down, Hyde.
It's gonna make
a mess for everyone.

1:00:52.949 --> 1:00:55.383
Take the wagon back
with Knowlin.

1:00:55.385 --> 1:00:57.251
I ain't leaving.
Yeah, you are.

1:00:57.253 --> 1:00:59.188
And take the ink pusher
with you.

1:01:07.330 --> 1:01:10.364
You're losing control here,
Sheriff.

1:01:10.366 --> 1:01:14.037
It's only a matter of time
before this posse rides
with someone else.

1:01:15.638 --> 1:01:17.206
Randolph, let's go.

1:02:49.065 --> 1:02:50.466
We got the end.

1:02:51.667 --> 1:02:54.971
Read it from
"an unnamed source."

1:02:57.073 --> 1:03:00.241
"An unnamed source
told posseman Ben de Crevecoeur

1:03:00.243 --> 1:03:02.743
that Willie Boy consumed
two bottles of demon water

1:03:02.745 --> 1:03:06.480
before he killed William
in his sleep and kidnapped
his 16-year-old daughter."

1:03:06.482 --> 1:03:08.017
She's 14.

1:03:09.852 --> 1:03:10.987
But you said 16.

1:03:12.054 --> 1:03:13.756
Well, now she's 14.

1:03:23.065 --> 1:03:26.702
We are selling fear,
Mr. Randolph, are we not?

1:03:31.274 --> 1:03:33.409
I like your style, Mr. Ben.

1:03:35.211 --> 1:03:37.378
De Crevecoeur.

1:03:37.380 --> 1:03:39.048
It's French.

1:03:40.917 --> 1:03:43.653
"And kidnapped
his 14-year-old daughter.

1:03:44.620 --> 1:03:48.088
Mr. Ben De Crevecoeur warns

1:03:48.090 --> 1:03:50.791
that there are rumors
of an Indian insurgence

1:03:50.793 --> 1:03:52.493
that may be mounting
in the desert."

1:03:52.495 --> 1:03:54.964
The rest is good.

1:03:56.532 --> 1:03:57.733
Print it.

1:04:38.507 --> 1:04:40.943
Did they sing salt
for William?

1:04:41.777 --> 1:04:43.012
I don't know.

1:04:46.649 --> 1:04:49.652
We gotta go. Soon.

1:05:29.392 --> 1:05:31.427
I need medicine.

1:05:34.397 --> 1:05:35.496
What?

1:05:35.498 --> 1:05:36.897
Your grandma.

1:05:36.899 --> 1:05:39.502
She must have something
to help.

1:05:42.238 --> 1:05:43.339
No.

1:05:44.607 --> 1:05:46.106
I can't leave you here
like this.

1:05:46.108 --> 1:05:47.743
I need medicine.

1:06:02.591 --> 1:06:03.924
Will you go?

1:06:03.926 --> 1:06:05.225
Okay.

1:06:05.227 --> 1:06:07.561
I love you, boy.

1:06:07.563 --> 1:06:11.167
- Okay. I'll go.
- I love you.

1:09:14.083 --> 1:09:15.317
Rebecca?

1:09:16.785 --> 1:09:18.521
There's someone out there.

1:09:22.658 --> 1:09:23.792
Stay back.

1:09:37.806 --> 1:09:38.908
Willie Boy.

1:09:48.050 --> 1:09:49.950
Where is
Carlota?

1:09:49.952 --> 1:09:51.153
She's sick.

1:09:52.821 --> 1:09:54.657
Snake bite.

1:09:55.658 --> 1:09:57.658
She needs medicine.

1:09:57.660 --> 1:09:59.662
I had nowhere else
to go.

1:10:02.331 --> 1:10:03.832
Go get the medicine.

1:10:08.470 --> 1:10:10.172
You can take
what you need.

1:10:11.507 --> 1:10:13.909
Sheriff Wilson
has a posse mounted.

1:10:15.311 --> 1:10:17.346
Been tracking you
since Banning.

1:10:20.316 --> 1:10:21.951
Thank you.

1:12:05.788 --> 1:12:07.323
We're getting close, right?

1:12:14.930 --> 1:12:18.765
We'll bring that boy in.
But I need him alive.

1:12:18.767 --> 1:12:21.003
It's the law, John.

1:12:21.770 --> 1:12:24.237
I've known men like you.

1:12:24.239 --> 1:12:28.208
Lawmen enforcing your laws
on foreign land.

1:12:28.210 --> 1:12:30.243
I am tired of it.

1:12:30.245 --> 1:12:31.947
If you shoot that boy...

1:12:33.582 --> 1:12:35.317
I'll put you down.

1:12:37.519 --> 1:12:39.188
No.

1:12:39.688 --> 1:12:41.457
I don't think so.

1:12:42.491 --> 1:12:44.560
You've had your fill
of death.

1:12:45.294 --> 1:12:47.661
I can see it in your eyes.

1:12:47.663 --> 1:12:49.698
Smell it on you.

1:13:39.615 --> 1:13:41.848
Go to hell, Willie Boy.

1:13:45.220 --> 1:13:46.889
This is not the way.

1:13:48.056 --> 1:13:50.490
Better make it quick.

1:13:50.492 --> 1:13:52.192
I got a clean shot.

1:13:52.194 --> 1:13:53.996
You sure it's him?

1:13:55.864 --> 1:13:57.065
Oh, I am.

1:14:06.842 --> 1:14:07.943
Seen him?

1:14:08.844 --> 1:14:10.577
Who?

1:14:10.579 --> 1:14:11.814
The boy.

1:14:18.921 --> 1:14:20.153
Have you seen Frank?

1:14:20.155 --> 1:14:22.758
Fired? I heard a shot.

1:15:18.447 --> 1:15:19.548
No.

1:15:22.217 --> 1:15:25.521
This way!

1:16:23.545 --> 1:16:25.445
Willie Boy, no.

1:16:25.447 --> 1:16:27.182
Oh, hell.

1:16:29.318 --> 1:16:30.984
You can say that again.

1:16:30.986 --> 1:16:33.119
That son of a bitch
killed her.

1:16:33.121 --> 1:16:35.424
- Willie.
- I knew he would.

1:16:37.359 --> 1:16:40.062
You take that picture,
I'll take your head.

1:16:43.065 --> 1:16:46.333
Mr. Madison, you're gonna go
back on the wagon with Hyde.

1:16:46.335 --> 1:16:48.637
The rest of us, mount up.

1:16:49.905 --> 1:16:52.674
Segundo,
we could use the help.

1:17:43.458 --> 1:17:46.662
How does it feel?
First time on a horse.

1:18:18.293 --> 1:18:19.995
Get him!

1:18:32.641 --> 1:18:36.344
He's right up there.
He just ducked under
them rocks right there.

1:18:37.813 --> 1:18:39.347
Hyah! Hyah!

1:18:47.255 --> 1:18:48.657
Willie Boy!

1:18:57.833 --> 1:18:59.434
Shit.

1:19:09.678 --> 1:19:11.213
We'll find him.

1:20:03.398 --> 1:20:05.400
Sheriff,
you shouldn't be here.

1:20:08.270 --> 1:20:09.371
Forgive me.

1:20:20.549 --> 1:20:21.950
Fall back!

1:20:22.751 --> 1:20:23.819
Where is he?

1:20:24.386 --> 1:20:25.718
Straight up!

1:20:25.720 --> 1:20:26.955
Hang in there, Toutain.

1:20:28.123 --> 1:20:29.357
He's up top!

1:20:31.226 --> 1:20:32.659
Spread out. Spread out!

1:20:32.661 --> 1:20:33.929
Get up against the rocks.

1:20:35.831 --> 1:20:39.432
Hang in there, Toutain!
Bring him out!

1:20:39.434 --> 1:20:41.436
He's got to come down!

1:20:42.571 --> 1:20:45.672
Right there.

1:20:45.674 --> 1:20:47.974
- Toutain, get clear.
- He's up on them rocks!

1:20:47.976 --> 1:20:50.712
- Come on!
- Return fire!

1:20:56.117 --> 1:20:58.151
- He's running west.
- Shoot him!

1:20:58.153 --> 1:20:59.886
- Get him! Get him!
- Shoot him!

1:20:59.888 --> 1:21:01.556
Goddamn it!

1:21:06.595 --> 1:21:08.496
Who's got eyes on him?

1:21:13.935 --> 1:21:15.871
Ben!

1:21:20.275 --> 1:21:21.676
Back in the canyon!

1:21:31.519 --> 1:21:32.721
Clear out!

1:21:41.796 --> 1:21:44.230
He's gunning for the horses.
Not us.

1:21:44.232 --> 1:21:46.966
You can write that
on your tombstone, not mine.

1:21:54.643 --> 1:21:56.142
Where you going?

1:21:56.144 --> 1:21:58.278
Stop moving! Stop!

1:21:58.280 --> 1:21:59.479
Stop it, Toutain!

1:21:59.481 --> 1:22:02.949
Damn it!
Get back here!

1:22:15.830 --> 1:22:16.896
Frank?

1:22:16.898 --> 1:22:18.998
Never trust an enemy.

1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:20.535
Where you going?

1:22:22.037 --> 1:22:23.705
Fuck you up.

1:22:28.510 --> 1:22:29.644
Sheriff.

1:22:30.478 --> 1:22:31.878
Sheriff!

1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:33.581
Willie Boy!

1:22:35.083 --> 1:22:36.718
Willie Boy!

1:22:45.927 --> 1:22:47.629
Carlota's dead.

1:22:51.399 --> 1:22:54.235
Hyde tracked you
to Pipes Canyon.

1:22:57.772 --> 1:22:59.808
We found her body
by the rocks.

1:23:02.978 --> 1:23:05.180
Her body's going back
to Banning.

1:23:07.682 --> 1:23:09.451
If you turn yourself in...

1:23:11.953 --> 1:23:14.155
you can have
your proper goodbyes.

1:23:19.794 --> 1:23:21.129
She's dead.

1:23:26.468 --> 1:23:27.836
She's dead.

1:25:47.041 --> 1:25:48.843
Couldn't find a way
to the top.

1:25:50.278 --> 1:25:51.646
I didn't see him.

1:25:53.581 --> 1:25:55.016
What do you want to do?

1:26:02.157 --> 1:26:04.192
We go home.
Sheriff.

1:26:05.593 --> 1:26:07.629
Sheriff!
We go home.

1:28:01.042 --> 1:28:03.676
Doc says you're gonna be
just fine.

1:28:03.678 --> 1:28:07.980
As long as
he keeps giving me
this shit.

1:28:07.982 --> 1:28:13.419
Oh, Frank.
Why did we go after
that boy for?

1:28:13.421 --> 1:28:14.887
What do you mean?

1:28:14.889 --> 1:28:17.623
Justice.

1:28:17.625 --> 1:28:19.558
We're the law.

1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:23.663
Ain't no one of us
went after that boy
for justice, Frank.

1:28:23.665 --> 1:28:26.100
Least of all me.

1:28:27.969 --> 1:28:30.405
Oh, Frank, we made a mess.

1:28:31.439 --> 1:28:34.173
We really made a mess.

1:28:36.678 --> 1:28:38.844
Oh, Frank.

1:28:40.081 --> 1:28:42.214
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

1:28:42.216 --> 1:28:43.849
Um...

1:28:43.851 --> 1:28:47.322
My vest pocket.
I got something for you.

1:28:50.625 --> 1:28:51.993
Where did it go?

1:29:03.905 --> 1:29:05.006
Frank.

1:29:08.643 --> 1:29:11.145
Drinkin' ain't gonna
bring her back, brother.

1:30:18.980 --> 1:30:21.616
I thought for sure
he shot himself up here.

1:30:23.084 --> 1:30:24.886
Damn coward.

1:30:38.633 --> 1:30:39.801
Uh...

1:30:40.668 --> 1:30:42.637
wh-what now?

1:30:43.905 --> 1:30:45.304
We track him down.

1:30:47.074 --> 1:30:49.708
We couldn't catch him
when he had a day's jump on us.

1:30:49.710 --> 1:30:51.312
He's damn near
five away now.

1:30:54.048 --> 1:30:55.983
What are you seein', Jim?

1:30:58.252 --> 1:30:59.954
What if it was suicide?

1:31:01.923 --> 1:31:04.723
Duh. There's no body.

1:31:04.725 --> 1:31:07.760
Obviously ain't here
for your brains, Cochise.

1:31:07.762 --> 1:31:09.397
His body would be
too bloated to move.

1:31:10.264 --> 1:31:11.365
He'd just tear apart.

1:31:12.733 --> 1:31:14.200
Whoa, whoa. Come on.

1:31:14.202 --> 1:31:16.168
What we doing here, Frank?

1:31:16.170 --> 1:31:17.970
- It's over.
- The hell it is.

1:31:17.972 --> 1:31:20.439
We can't go back
with nothing.
Camera.

1:31:20.441 --> 1:31:22.675
- What are you doing?
- Jim, lay down.

1:31:22.677 --> 1:31:25.044
No. No, no, no.

1:31:25.046 --> 1:31:26.712
You're gonna let
that Indian win.

1:31:26.714 --> 1:31:29.114
You're saying he beat us.
You sure about this?

1:31:29.116 --> 1:31:32.485
No one's gonna see
that boy again.
He's either dead or dead inside.

1:31:32.487 --> 1:31:34.386
We're chasing a ghost.

1:31:34.388 --> 1:31:36.121
No one's gonna believe us
without seeing a goddamn head.

1:31:36.123 --> 1:31:37.723
No one!

1:31:37.725 --> 1:31:39.859
I'll sell it.
People want it to end.

1:31:39.861 --> 1:31:42.394
We'll give it to them.

1:31:42.396 --> 1:31:46.000
One photo,
I got my ticket
out of this hellhole,

1:31:46.968 --> 1:31:48.870
and you will return home
as saints.

1:31:49.904 --> 1:31:52.238
You robbing us
of our victory here, Sheriff,

1:31:52.240 --> 1:31:54.141
and God help me,
everyone gonna know what--

1:31:58.179 --> 1:32:00.145
You gotta learn to shut up.

1:32:00.147 --> 1:32:02.383
Now get in the picture
or don't get in the picture.

1:32:02.817 --> 1:32:04.151
I don't care.

1:32:06.187 --> 1:32:07.855
Where do you want me?

1:32:09.123 --> 1:32:10.458
Right there.

1:32:16.230 --> 1:32:17.798
More guns.

1:32:23.437 --> 1:32:24.906
On your side.

1:32:35.383 --> 1:32:37.752
Okay,
this is a long exposure,
so don't move.

1:32:38.519 --> 1:32:39.921
Don't move.

1:32:44.892 --> 1:32:46.394
Well, smile,
for Christ's sakes.

1:32:47.194 --> 1:32:48.563
You're heroes.

1:32:57.705 --> 1:32:58.773
We got it.

1:32:59.807 --> 1:33:01.373
Thank you, Mr. Madison.

1:33:01.375 --> 1:33:02.975
You can hitch a ride
with Ben here,

1:33:02.977 --> 1:33:05.146
and both of you
can get the hell
out of my sight.

1:33:09.116 --> 1:33:11.385
How long to get
that picture developed?

1:33:11.986 --> 1:33:13.187
Boys.

1:33:53.894 --> 1:33:54.996
Enough?

1:33:56.330 --> 1:33:57.431
