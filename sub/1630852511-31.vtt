00:01.369 --> 00:02.368
- Here we go.

00:02.436 --> 00:04.003
- When you hang around clowns,

00:04.071 --> 00:06.472
don't be surprised that
your life becomes a circus.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.942
- Never have I ever had my kids
walk in mid smoosh.

00:10.044 --> 00:10.976
- Ugh!

00:11.078 --> 00:12.244
- God.
- Jesus.

00:12.313 --> 00:13.946
- It's never happened to you?
- Thank God.

00:14.048 --> 00:15.681
- Any sex with Vinny
recently or--

00:15.750 --> 00:17.383
- No. I just [bleep]
him a little bit.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.984
all: Oh!

00:19.053 --> 00:21.186
- I didn't know Deena
was Little Miss No Gag Reflex.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.955
- Vinny.
- Stop.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.823
- Dren always loves
Jenni's titties.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.058
Give her the titties.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.459
- Everyone's allowed
to get intoxicated.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.428
Nicole, Deena,
but no one gives a [bleep].

00:29.497 --> 00:31.096
- Do not pull me
into this, bitch.

00:31.165 --> 00:33.232
- She just wanted
to be a little [bleep] head.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.533
- Oh, damn,

00:34.602 --> 00:36.535
- I'm sorry to break the news
to you,

00:36.604 --> 00:38.637
that love letter, I was JK.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.172
- Oh, wow.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.740
- Vinny's just a lot
about Vinny.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.075
- Wait, what?

00:43.144 --> 00:44.777
- Angelina, is there
a new man in your life?

00:44.845 --> 00:46.211
- There's a few
that I'm dating,

00:46.280 --> 00:47.880
sos one of them.
- Oh!

00:47.948 --> 00:49.982
- She has a condition
known as lie-abetes.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.350
- Oh!

00:51.419 --> 00:53.552
- My life is not
your [bleep] business.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.187
- You know what,
you just can't play anymore.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.221
- What the [bleep]?

00:56.290 --> 00:58.157
- Are you leaving?
- Whoa.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.625
- Wait, where is he going?

01:00.928 --> 01:01.827
- ♪ Get crazy, get wild ♪

01:05.433 --> 01:07.933
- Welcome to part two
of the first ever

01:08.035 --> 01:10.569
"Jersey Shore:
Family Vacation Reunion."

01:10.638 --> 01:12.538
I'm your host,
Justina Valentine.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.540
And the roommates
are in the building...

01:14.608 --> 01:16.375
[cheers and applause]
To break down every second

01:16.444 --> 01:17.843
of their vacation.

01:17.912 --> 01:21.680
Let's jump back to answering
more of your fan questions.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.449
Now, Deena,
Anthony was wondering,

01:23.517 --> 01:25.384
"What's your dream
vacation spot

01:25.453 --> 01:26.418
that you want to visit next?"

01:26.487 --> 01:28.153
- What I would love to do

01:28.222 --> 01:30.255
is go to Jamaica...
- Ooh.

01:30.324 --> 01:33.492
- And see, like, Nikki kind
of show us the ropes.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.561
- Nice.
- That would be fun.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.062
- That would be dope.
- That would be fun.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.664
- Nikki would be
a great tour guide.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.399
both: Yeah.
- Deena and Nicole were

01:40.468 --> 01:41.767
in rare form this season.

01:41.836 --> 01:43.602
I mean, no matter
how much they mature,

01:43.671 --> 01:46.071
the meatballs
are never afraid to get rowdy.

01:46.140 --> 01:49.108
And this season,
they got saucier than ever.

01:49.176 --> 01:50.275
Let's take a look.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.944
- I think I might be
a little drunk.

01:52.046 --> 01:53.579
[burps] Oh, my--

01:53.647 --> 01:55.247
ooh,
I've been doing it all day.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.282
- udle]

01:57.351 --> 01:59.251
- Can you gag me?
I need to throw up tonight.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.153
Turn the roof off
this bitch.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.222
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
- Come on.

02:03.290 --> 02:06.024
- My God, I just burped up
tacos from, like, two days ago.

02:06.093 --> 02:08.694
- Whee!
- Are we on a hill?

02:08.762 --> 02:11.997
- No, no, we're flat.
- Why did I think--

02:12.066 --> 02:13.899
- 'Cause you did
not wax, bitch!

02:15.202 --> 02:16.735
- [gasps] Oh, my God!

02:16.804 --> 02:18.137
[screams]

02:18.205 --> 02:21.240
- We couldn't sleep last night
'cause this [bleep] owl.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.976
Hoo!
[owl hooting]

02:24.044 --> 02:25.844
It was like...
[mimics owl hooting]

02:25.946 --> 02:27.746
- I swear to God,
if I hear it tonight,

02:27.815 --> 02:31.617
I'll go run outside and go,
"Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!"

02:31.685 --> 02:34.353
- What the [bleep]
is happening?

02:34.421 --> 02:35.687
- I'm gonna say sorry in doggy.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.556
- Just shut--no.
[mimics barking]

02:37.625 --> 02:40.392
- Everybody needs to go to bed!
Everybody!

02:40.461 --> 02:43.095
- I didn't even know an owls
were like a real thing.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.063
Like, I know they're real.
- I didn't know--

02:45.132 --> 02:46.798
- Like, to be outside
our window and go...

02:46.867 --> 02:47.799
[mimics owl hooting]

02:47.868 --> 02:49.334
- Those noises were crazy.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.669
- That's the meatballs.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.405
- Oh, my God.
- Wow. A legendary duo.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.807
Listen, you guys have been
meatballing together

02:55.876 --> 02:57.009
for a long time.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.610
But how has
your meatball lifestyle...

02:58.679 --> 03:01.146
- Ages.
- Just changed, you know,

03:01.215 --> 03:04.049
in comparison to the early days
down the shore?

03:04.118 --> 03:05.817
- Well...
- I mean...

03:05.886 --> 03:07.286
- I feel like we
drink classier now.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.387
- Yeah, we drink wine.

03:08.455 --> 03:09.521
- Like, back in the day...
- Yeah.

03:09.590 --> 03:10.489
- It was like
Long Island Iced Teas.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.623
- Shots.
- Right.

03:11.692 --> 03:12.758
- Shots, like the pretzel
shots, remember?

03:12.826 --> 03:13.859
- Pretzel. Yeah.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.093
- And when we're
on these vacations,

03:15.162 --> 03:16.762
now that we're moms, like...

03:16.830 --> 03:19.031
- I think we go harder.
- I don't do this at home.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.232
- Even Jenni.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.434
- I'm like, I'm letting loose.
- Yeah.

03:22.503 --> 03:23.936
- And I just want
to have a good time.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.104
And when I'm with my meatball,
like, we literally,

03:26.173 --> 03:27.639
like, just, like,
read each other's minds.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.874
- Right.
- It's friggin' weird.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.275
- Yes.
- Telepathic meatballs.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.877
- So we're like, we just want
to have a good time.

03:31.946 --> 03:33.111
- Yeah, they're still a blast
in the glass.

03:33.180 --> 03:36.148
- Now, Jenni, you're usually
their handler

03:36.217 --> 03:38.884
but you went full meatball
at Pauly's show.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.152
- Oh.

03:40.221 --> 03:41.687
- You passed out
in the car ride home.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.389
I mean, how hard is it
to keep up with the meatballs?

03:44.458 --> 03:46.592
- I don't understand, like,
we'll literally be

03:46.660 --> 03:48.560
on like E, like, empty.
- Yeah.

03:48.629 --> 03:51.530
- And then something in them
just like recharges.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.664
[laughter]

03:52.733 --> 03:53.899
- Second wind. Yeah.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.500
- Yeah, you said that
in the car.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.203
- But like three or four winds.
And they're just ready to go.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.738
They'll literally start
to fall asleep

03:59.807 --> 04:01.073
and then wake up and then--

04:01.141 --> 04:02.174
- Rejuvenated.
- Yeah.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.342
- It's like putting
the meatballs

04:03.410 --> 04:04.443
back in the microwave.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.078
- Yeah.
- Honestly...

04:06.146 --> 04:07.312
- Yes.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.714
- Some of our best moments
are in the car.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.048
- Car ride home.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.883
- Like, the club's fun,
but when you're drunk,

04:11.952 --> 04:13.418
and you're going home
with your girls...

04:13.487 --> 04:14.720
- Yeah.
- The best time in the car.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.289
- So, Ange, what's your
favorite meatball moment?

04:17.358 --> 04:20.259
- I think in the hallway
with that blow-up doll,

04:20.327 --> 04:21.760
that was the best.
- Oh, my God.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.128
At your bachelorette?
- Do you remember, like,

04:23.197 --> 04:25.097
I was like [bleep] reverse
cowgirling it?

04:25.165 --> 04:26.331
- Yes.
- And you were like,

04:26.400 --> 04:27.899
"Keep going, keep going."
It was just so fun.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.134
- Oh, my God.
- It's always a good time.

04:29.203 --> 04:31.103
- I have my favorite moment,
so legendary.

04:31.171 --> 04:35.140
In Italy, they literally
like pretended to be a bull...

04:35.209 --> 04:36.141
- The two meatballs?

04:36.210 --> 04:37.209
- Yeah, the meatballs.
- Wow.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.343
- They went straight
into a bush.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.444
- Oh, my gosh.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.746
- They feel no pain,
the meatballs.

04:40.814 --> 04:41.913
- No, we bounce back.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.115
- They're really committed.

04:43.183 --> 04:44.483
- We were, like, yellow.
- Yeah.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.451
- Now that I'm like 34,
I feel it the next day.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.686
- Oh, yeah.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.054
- Like, after falling off
the stage, I'm like,

04:49.123 --> 04:51.723
"Jenni, why does my neck hurt?"
[laughter]

04:51.792 --> 04:54.059
- But, Vin, I gotta ask you,
the night when they were

04:54.128 --> 04:56.762
hooting all night like owls,
were you pissed?

04:56.830 --> 04:58.297
- Actually, yeah,
I was because, like,

04:58.365 --> 05:00.032
I'm big on my sleep.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.933
- Oh. Eight hours of REM, kid.
- Sorry, Vin.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.602
- I need like
eight hours of REM.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.003
- Yeah.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.372
- And that night, like,
we finally hit the pillow,

05:07.441 --> 05:09.174
were like, "Ah!"
Like, it was a long day.

05:09.243 --> 05:10.375
- Yeah.
- Sorry, guys.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.144
- And then, like--
we just hear, like...

05:12.212 --> 05:14.112
[grunting] You know?
[Jenni mimics hooting]

05:14.181 --> 05:15.981
- Like, I actually thought
it was real animals outside.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.115
- Yeah.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.150
- And I was like,
"What the [bleep]?"

05:18.218 --> 05:19.384
- Yeah.
- You were awake also.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.186
- So let's talk about the owl
in El Paso

05:21.255 --> 05:23.188
because, Nicole,
you said, and I quote,

05:23.257 --> 05:25.757
"I didn't even know owls
were a real thing."

05:25.826 --> 05:27.626
So talk to us about that.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.194
- Just because I've never seen
an owl actually,

05:29.263 --> 05:30.762
like, outdoors.
- Okay.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.798
- Like, you know,
you see it on TV

05:32.866 --> 05:34.132
or you see it in, like, a zoo.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.600
- So you thought it was
like a mystical creature?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.502
- I never saw it, like,
in the back of my house.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.670
- Right.
- Hooting.

05:38.739 --> 05:39.771
- I'm the one that rented
that house.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.939
I had to deal
with the HOA after that.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.107
All the neighbors
wrote a letter.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.576
- Oh, get out of here.
- Oh, my God.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.478
- All right.
Now that Nicole and Deena know

05:46.547 --> 05:48.046
owls are a real thing,

05:48.115 --> 05:50.849
let's see just how good
their animal knowledge is.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.484
I'm gonna describe an animal

05:52.553 --> 05:55.587
and you decide
if it's real or fake.

05:55.656 --> 05:58.123
First up,
we have the blobfish.

05:58.192 --> 06:02.394
This deep sea fish lacks
substantial bone or muscle.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.397
All right. Now is the blobfish
real or fake?

06:05.466 --> 06:07.165
- Real.
- Real.

06:07.234 --> 06:08.667
- So final answer real?

06:08.736 --> 06:10.235
- Real.
- You're correct.

06:10.304 --> 06:13.238
The blobfish is in fact real.
Let's take a look.

06:13.307 --> 06:15.006
- Oh, damn!
- Oh, sick.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.208
- That thing is gorgeous.

06:16.276 --> 06:17.776
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

06:17.845 --> 06:21.446
Next up, we have the jackalope,
a popular taxidermy trophy.

06:21.515 --> 06:24.549
Male jackalopes fight
using their antlers to win

06:24.618 --> 06:26.785
over potential mates.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.621
Ladies, is the jackalope
real or fake?

06:29.690 --> 06:32.090
- I just jackaloped one
in the dressing room.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.658
<i> [rimshot]</i>
- Vinny!

06:33.727 --> 06:36.294
- I'm going with false 'cause
I'm thinking of jack-o-lantern.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.629
- It's true. It's true.
- Okay, well, Deena,

06:37.698 --> 06:40.332
you are right.
The jackalope is fake.

06:40.401 --> 06:41.733
- So smart.
- All right.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.269
Last but not least,
this is my favorite one.

06:44.338 --> 06:46.271
It's the penis fish.

06:46.340 --> 06:48.740
It's a species
of marine spoon worm,

06:48.809 --> 06:52.511
large numbers of penis fish
have been known to wash ashore

06:52.579 --> 06:55.514
and become stranded
on the beaches of Japan.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.681
- Oh, my God.
- Sick.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.550
- Now is the penis fish
real or fake?

06:58.619 --> 06:59.551
- Fake.
- Real.

It was like a big elephant
in the room.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.299
And I was like, "Let's just
get it out in the open."

14:28.368 --> 14:29.901
- Right.
- Get it all out there.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.704
- Now, Jenni, it was like
you flipped a switch.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.973
You know, it felt like everyone
was getting grounded.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.542
Is there a nickname for the,
"I'm not done" Jenni?

14:37.611 --> 14:39.010
- Mom.
- Mom mode.

14:39.079 --> 14:43.147
- Yo, she hit like a tone that,
like, I was terrified,

14:43.216 --> 14:45.350
and at the same time,
I was, like, impressed.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.651
- Passionate.
- Vin, can you give us

14:46.720 --> 14:48.353
your best
"I'm not done" impression?

14:48.421 --> 14:50.521
- I'm not done!

14:50.590 --> 14:52.824
- Oh, my God.
- That was pretty good.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.826
- It was way louder than that
if you were in the room.

14:54.895 --> 14:55.960
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

14:56.029 --> 14:56.961
- Listen, we got where
we needed to get.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.363
- Yes.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.931
- At the end of it,
that's the most important part.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.833
- Deena, if you could
go back in time,

15:01.902 --> 15:03.167
would you have escaped
the suite

15:03.236 --> 15:04.802
just to get to
the pool party earlier?

15:04.871 --> 15:06.738
- Definitely.
- "Definitely."

15:06.840 --> 15:08.606
- They would have snuck out.
- Vinny!

15:08.675 --> 15:10.074
- Vinny's the worst. I'm sorry.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.576
- I hate him.
- Now, Mike, you thought

15:11.645 --> 15:13.945
San Diego
was gonna be good vibes only.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.213
- Yes, yes.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.915
- But it was actually
the opposite of that.

15:16.983 --> 15:18.316
- Yes.
- Did you really think

15:18.385 --> 15:21.286
Angelina wasn't gonna find out
about the podcast?

15:21.354 --> 15:22.487
- Um, I didn't.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.355
I thought that everything
was smoothed over

15:24.424 --> 15:26.057
between Angelina and myself.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.892
We had multiple meetings.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.627
I always like
to be full disclosure.

15:29.696 --> 15:30.895
So if you guys
ask me anything...

15:30.964 --> 15:32.096
- But you didn't though.
- Like, I'll tell you--

15:32.165 --> 15:33.197
- You weren't though.
- Not necessarily.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.666
- Because when I sat down
with Jenni,

15:34.734 --> 15:37.435
I heard things that were not
disclosed at those meetings.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.004
- No, but--
- In all fairness, the podcast

15:40.073 --> 15:42.240
was something that was thrown
in group chat

15:42.309 --> 15:45.944
as a joke and were super,
super sarcastic all the time.

15:46.012 --> 15:47.078
- Right.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.047
- So sometimes
that doesn't translate

15:49.115 --> 15:51.049
if someone ike  just loo-

15:51.117 --> 15:52.050
- The text.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.384
- The text.
- Got you.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.686
- Yeah, but, Mike,
I didn't take it like a joke.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.921
When I found out,
I was so pissed at you

15:56.990 --> 15:58.289
because you told me,
I was like,

15:58.358 --> 15:59.691
"Wait, what the [bleep]?"

15:59.759 --> 16:01.259
- But it's like you have
to admit,

16:01.328 --> 16:02.460
the streets were very messy.

16:02.529 --> 16:03.828
- Who gives a [bleep]
about the streets?

16:03.897 --> 16:05.096
- You're a reality star.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.431
You signed up for this
14 years ago, sweetheart.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.765
- It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.133
But you brought it on here.
And then honestly...

16:09.202 --> 16:10.401
- Brought it on here?
- To be honest,

16:10.470 --> 16:12.370
it's my real life,
and it was my real divorce

16:12.439 --> 16:14.038
and my real [bleep], man.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.707
- But you understand
that we get paid

16:15.775 --> 16:17.742

and all of our lives.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.043

16:19.112 --> 16:20.278
- No, let's keep it positive.
- No, no. Yeah.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.046

known as lie-abetes.

16:26.519 --> 16:27.752

- Snitch.

16:27.821 --> 16:28.920

16:28.989 --> 16:30.755
- You got involved
too far, man.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.056

16:32.125 --> 16:34.359
But also take a little bit
of accountability.

16:35.562 --> 16:36.794
Living my [bleep] life?

16:36.863 --> 16:38.963
- You had multiple side pieces.
- No, I did not!

16:39.032 --> 16:40.465
- You admitted it
in a scene with me.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.467
- First of all, me and Chris
were done with the Luis thing.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.002
That's not a side piece.
- Listen, that's fine.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.069

We can't put product
in our hair.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.615
- It's gonna be
the best day ever, right?

21:24.684 --> 21:27.385
all: [bored] Yeah.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.053
- Yeah.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.221
Yeah, Pauly.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.856
- This is [bleep] terrible.

21:31.924 --> 21:35.159
- Everybody can drink as long
as you work it off?

21:35.228 --> 21:39.163
- Look at me.
- What sorcery of hell is this?

21:39.232 --> 21:41.932
- Nah, I'm just gonna swing it
around a little bit.

21:42.001 --> 21:45.336
I'd rather clean up my cat
[bleep] off my wall

21:45.405 --> 21:47.204
than to jump rope
with Vinny today.

21:47.273 --> 21:48.806
I don't like this.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.609
- I got your smoothie
and your shots right here.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.711
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God. This smells.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.012
- It smells ridiculous.
- Ugh!

21:55.081 --> 21:56.480
- I deserve a day.
- I'm not gonna drink this.

21:56.582 --> 21:57.948
- That I never got one before.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.717
- The man is
the opposite of fun.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.619
- Are you really gonna
drink it?

22:02.655 --> 22:04.755
- [coughs]
- I did it for you, Vin.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.123
- The best thing about Vin Day

22:06.192 --> 22:08.993
is they only happen
once every 33 years.

22:09.062 --> 22:10.895
- Oh my!

22:10.963 --> 22:12.196
- Yeah!

22:12.265 --> 22:14.498
[cheers and applause]

22:14.567 --> 22:16.300
- Yay!
- I like this part of Vin Day.

22:16.369 --> 22:19.503
- You guys got no faith in me.
But I'm being fun.

22:19.605 --> 22:21.005
- My man never really
gets a day,

22:21.074 --> 22:23.441
never really gets to party,
so he's the best side piece

22:23.509 --> 22:25.076
a man could ask for.
- Yeah.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.877
- To Vinny!
- To Vinny!

22:26.946 --> 22:28.312
- I love you, bro.

22:28.381 --> 22:29.747
- Love you.

22:29.816 --> 22:31.549
- All right, Jenni, start.

22:31.617 --> 22:35.519
- Vinny, you are the brother
I never wanted

22:35.621 --> 22:38.489
but I am so thankful to have.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.891
Love you dearly.
And I'm your number one fan.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.127
- Aw!
- Yay!

22:43.196 --> 22:46.630
- Even though today I had
to throw myself this party,

22:46.699 --> 22:49.333
hearing everybody
say something nice about me

22:49.402 --> 22:51.369
is honestly unbelievable.

22:51.437 --> 22:53.104
Tonight might be like
the best dinner

22:53.172 --> 22:54.572
I've ever experienced
with everybody.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.407
- Yay, Vin Day!

22:56.476 --> 22:58.342
all: [chanting]
Vin Day! Vin Day!

22:58.411 --> 23:00.311
Vin Day! Vin Day!

23:00.380 --> 23:02.780
- Wow.
- Now, Vinny, Vin Day

23:02.849 --> 23:04.815
has been a long time coming.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.851
How did it make you feel
that your roommates

23:06.919 --> 23:08.886
were finally celebrating you?

23:08.955 --> 23:11.222
- I had, like, mixed emotions
about it

23:11.290 --> 23:14.825
because, like, I had to throw
the party for myself.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.761
They didn't even want
to be there kind of thing.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.129
- Oh, wow.
- That's not true.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.430
- He's being dramatic.

23:19.499 --> 23:20.731
- We wanted to. Don't lie.
- That [bleep] soft.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.366
- That [bleep] was weird.
- So drama.

23:22.435 --> 23:23.834
- Rope, jump rope.
- So, um, yeah.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.103
- His type of day
wasn't something we're into.

23:26.172 --> 23:28.506
This guy took us jump roping
and then drinking, right?

23:28.574 --> 23:29.707
- Yeah. Like, who wants that?

23:29.776 --> 23:30.775
- So you're gonna jump rope
and drink.

23:30.843 --> 23:31.976
Like, it just doesn't mix.

23:32.044 --> 23:32.977
- It's gonna give you angina.
- Yeah.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.245
- Acid reflux and [bleep].

23:34.313 --> 23:35.546
- He wanted us to eat
all these keto snacks

23:35.615 --> 23:37.548
and no dessert, no carbs.

23:37.617 --> 23:38.849
- Okay.
- That's not fun.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.985
- Vinny's just a lot
about Vinny, you know?

23:41.053 --> 23:42.453
- Wait a minute, what?

23:42.522 --> 23:45.022
Wait a minute, what?
- Oh, gee!

23:45.091 --> 23:46.557
- I never had a day.
I never had a day.

23:46.626 --> 23:49.460
- I do have to say,
I tried my best, right?

23:49.529 --> 23:52.329
Out of everyone,
I got a burger with no bun.

23:52.398 --> 23:53.464
- Wow.
- Yeah, she did. She did.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.865
- I did.
- So you put the effort in?

23:54.934 --> 23:56.267
- I did.

23:56.335 --> 23:58.602
- Pauly, what was your
favorite part about Vin Day?

23:58.671 --> 24:01.205
- The best part about Vin Day
was Vin Night.

24:01.274 --> 24:02.773
It was awesome.
- That was fun.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.108
- Like, we turned up.

24:04.177 --> 24:05.743
We went to the strip club.

24:05.812 --> 24:06.844
- Nice.
- This guy was dancing.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.546
- We had blow-up Vinny heads.

24:08.614 --> 24:09.947
- It was awesome.
- I love that.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.048
- That's the Vinny we love.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.516
- I miss that.
- When Vinny turns up...

24:12.585 --> 24:13.984
- Come alive in the nighttime.
- Yeah. He's nocturnal.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.186
- He literally is a meatball.
- Yeah.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.854
- And we have so much fun
with him,

24:16.923 --> 24:18.722
and we like live for that.
- Aw!

24:18.791 --> 24:20.558
- But we don't really see
that any too much though.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.860
- Vin Night was like the best.
- That was everything.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.195
- For sure.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.797
So San Diego was filled
with surprise guests,

24:26.866 --> 24:30.968
and we actually have one
of them here at the Reunion.

24:31.037 --> 24:35.673
Right now, please welcome
Lola the Bunny.

24:35.775 --> 24:36.874
- Oh!

24:36.943 --> 24:38.142
- Yeah!
- Lola!

24:38.211 --> 24:40.878
- Lola, we're so happy
you can make it.

24:40.947 --> 24:44.181
- Why does Lola have a cane?
- Lola the Pimp Bunny.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.617
- Why does Lola look
like cracked out?

24:46.686 --> 24:48.285
- He's all screwed up.
- Lola.

24:48.354 --> 24:50.087
- Wait a second, guys.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.255
- Lola, you're too small.

24:51.324 --> 24:53.457
- I don't know
if that's Lola, guys.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.392
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah. That's an imposter.

24:55.461 --> 24:56.694
- Lola looks like
he cracked his neck.

24:56.796 --> 24:59.964
- Hey!
- What the [bleep]?

25:00.032 --> 25:01.966
What the [bleep]?

25:02.034 --> 25:04.668
- Oh, no.
- Uncle Nino. Yeah!

25:04.770 --> 25:06.036
- I'm back.

25:06.105 --> 25:08.339
- Uncle Nino, how you doing?
What are you doing here?

25:08.407 --> 25:09.640
- I'm doing marvelous.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.542
I miss my family,
so I came down to see them all.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.210
- Aw, that's amazing.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.779
Uncle Nino, we're gonna
get you a glass of wine.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.014
- A glass?
What the [bleep], a glass?

25:17.083 --> 25:18.148
A bottle of [bleep] wine.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.783
- A bottle.
Whatever this guy wants.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.485
- A glass? That was breakfast.

25:21.554 --> 25:22.720
[laughter]

25:22.788 --> 25:25.923
- Coming up, has Nicole
re n gn a hangover?

25:25.992 --> 25:28.158
The roommates discuss
and share their tried

25:28.227 --> 25:30.394
and tested hangover cures.

25:30.463 --> 25:32.830
[cheers and applause]

25:32.899 --> 25:34.164
- I was wondering why
Lola had a limp.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.634
- My meatballs. How are you?

25:38.304 --> 25:40.304
- Angelina, is there
a new man in your life?

25:40.373 --> 25:41.739
- There's a few
that I'm dating,

25:41.807 --> 25:43.440
so he's one of them.
[laughter]

25:43.509 --> 25:45.609
- Wait a second.
- What's his name?

25:46.779 --> 25:49.613
- ♪ If you wanna have fun
and do something crazy ♪

25:50.416 --> 25:51.248
- ♪ Get crazy, get wild ♪

25:51.317 --> 25:52.950

25:54.420 --> 25:57.588
- Welcome back.
We got more fan questions.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.391
Virginia asks, "Angelina,
who was the man you were

26:00.459 --> 26:02.893
FaceTiming in the car
after the winery?

26:02.962 --> 26:04.662
Is there a new man
in your life?"

26:04.730 --> 26:06.730
- It's somebody I'm dating
a little bit.

26:06.799 --> 26:07.798
- Nice.
- But there's a few

26:07.867 --> 26:09.633
that I'm dating,
so he's one of them.

26:09.702 --> 26:11.702
- Wait a second.
- Guess what his name is.

26:11.771 --> 26:14.872
- Guess what his name is.
- Vinny from Staten Island.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.707
- Yep.
- But not this Vinny.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.075
- It's meant to be.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.310
- Now I can be like, yeah,

26:19.378 --> 26:20.678
she's with Vinny
from Staten Island.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.012
And it's not me.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.582
- Now, Nicole, you claim
you've never had a hangover.

26:24.650 --> 26:27.384
But take a look at this.
- Oh.

26:27.453 --> 26:30.454
- I need to, like,
get my [bleep] together.

26:30.556 --> 26:33.223
I think I'm dying.

26:33.292 --> 26:34.592
Ugh.

26:34.660 --> 26:35.693
I'm gonna have
to gag myself.

26:35.761 --> 26:36.794
- We're in the theater.

26:36.862 --> 26:39.463
- Oh, look at
the little old lady.

26:39.565 --> 26:40.731
- I don't even care.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.466
- Oh, look at the little old
Chilean lady.

26:42.535 --> 26:45.736
You look like
your grandmother from Chile.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.571
- Ugh!

26:47.640 --> 26:49.440
[laughter]

26:49.542 --> 26:50.441
- Stop!

26:50.543 --> 26:51.942
- What did you drink?

26:52.011 --> 26:53.677
- Roommates, have you guys
ever seen Nicole hung over?

26:53.746 --> 26:54.745
- Yes.
- All the time.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.213
- Yes.
- Not like that though.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.349
- But not to, like,
that debilitating.

26:58.417 --> 27:01.986
- You used to sleep with, like,
Gatorades and SoCo bottle.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.354
- Yeah, but then
I would wake up fine.

27:03.422 --> 27:05.189
- Yeah.
- I actually had to function.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.490
- That next morning
after you drink,

27:06.592 --> 27:07.725
that [bleep] hits different.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.193
- Yeah.
What's your best hangover cure?

27:09.261 --> 27:10.995
- Morning sex is great
after that.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.096
- Ew!
- Yeah.

27:12.164 --> 27:13.497
- It doesn't feel nauseous?

27:13.566 --> 27:14.932
- Oh, like hangover sex?
- It does, but you're horny.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.667
- My thing is just
keep drinking.

27:16.736 --> 27:17.801
- The hair of the dog.
- Yeah.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.336
- You just wake up
and keep drinking.

27:19.405 --> 27:20.771
- Wake up and just keep going.
That's what me and Nicole do.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.072
- Yes.
- [inaudible].

27:22.141 --> 27:23.641
- She's been doing that
for like two years.

27:23.709 --> 27:25.509
- I think Angelina goes out
more than everyone, for sure.

27:25.578 --> 27:27.044
- She hasn't slept
in, like, 12 days.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.145
- Angelina's the craziest
drinker out of all of us.

27:28.214 --> 27:29.246
- I'm a [bleep] beast.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.914
I don't know why,
but I just am.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.683
- When was the last time
you slept?

27:32.752 --> 27:35.219
- Uh, not last night.
- Wow.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.221
- Jenni, you really let loose
in El Paso

27:37.289 --> 27:40.424
to the point that the meatballs
gave you an alter ego,

27:40.493 --> 27:43.127
AKA Prickly Elder. Take a look.

27:43.195 --> 27:45.162
- Mess.
- Oh, this is the best.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.968

27:51.037 --> 27:52.436

27:52.505 --> 27:55.406
Jenni has probably
drank two bottles of 1942

27:55.474 --> 27:56.674
on her own at this point.

27:56.742 --> 27:59.443
And I'm like,
"Oh, she's on one."

27:59.512 --> 28:01.745
Wait, what are we
gonna call her?

28:01.814 --> 28:03.614
I'm Meena, you're Dren...

28:03.683 --> 28:05.816
- Dren.
- What is this--this thing.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.018
- So we need a tired,
drunk JWOWW.

28:08.087 --> 28:09.353
- Well, that sounds
boring actually.

28:09.422 --> 28:11.021
- Prickly Elder.
- Prickly Elder.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.023
- Prickly Elder.
[laughter]

28:13.092 --> 28:15.693
- And so are we ever gonna see
Prickly Elder again

28:15.761 --> 28:17.327
or did you just
leave her in El Paso?

28:17.396 --> 28:20.097
- I had almost a full
bottle of 1942.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.465
- Oh, wow.
- She drank--no, you drank

28:21.534 --> 28:23.067
the whole thing, girl.
- Damn.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.903
- So, like, off camera,
we see a lot of Prickly Elder.

28:25.971 --> 28:27.037
- Yeah. Okay.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.839
- So me and Nicole
were very excited

28:28.908 --> 28:30.741
that she, like, came out.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.209
- Yeah.
- She was so much fun.

28:32.278 --> 28:33.811
That was like probably
one of my favorite times.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.212
- The best Jenni.
- Yeah.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.181
- Even when she punched me
in the neck, I was like,

28:37.249 --> 28:38.449
"Let's keep it moving."
- It was so fun.

28:38.517 --> 28:39.583

- Oh, [bleep].
- I'm dead.

- Yeah, Dee.
Little Miss No Gag Reflex.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.126
- Right.
- [laughs]

28:49.195 --> 28:50.661
- Okay.

- She was fun.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.669
I had a good time with her.

the roommates stopped by

public speaking,

29:13.552 --> 29:15.586
that would have been
my worst nightmare.

29:15.654 --> 29:18.188
- You killed the roasting thing
at Angelina's wedding.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.189
- Yeah, that was dope.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.691
- Oh!

29:35.975 --> 29:38.175
This is where
everything happens.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.444
- But we have to be quiet,

29:40.513 --> 29:43.113
- Quiet. Like, we're not
supposed to be in here. So shh!

- Just don't touch.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.457
Don't touch.

29:53.526 --> 29:55.392
- I feel like we're not
supposed to touch buttons.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.674
- We're back with more
"Reunion."

30:10.743 --> 30:13.177
So funny enough,
I was in San Diego

30:13.245 --> 30:14.711
with Nick Cannon, and we heard

30:14.780 --> 30:18.215
the "Jersey Shore" crew was
at the Wild 'N Out Restaurant.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.918
So Nick made some calls,
we popped over

30:20.986 --> 30:24.021
and we put their Wildstyle
skills to the test.

30:24.089 --> 30:25.856
Take a look.
- Oh, God.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.758
- Wild 'N! Wild 'N!

30:27.827 --> 30:30.961
- It's guys versus girls.
All my fellas make some noise.

30:31.030 --> 30:32.629
- This is actually
right up my alley.

30:32.698 --> 30:35.566
Like, I love Wild 'N Out.
I love playing improv games.

30:35.634 --> 30:37.467
But I'm a little scared
for my roommates.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.036
- What are we doing right now?

30:39.104 --> 30:41.138
- Hey, Pauly,
I found your comb.

30:41.207 --> 30:42.873
[laughter]
- Hey!

30:42.942 --> 30:45.843
- Honey, I got your
spaghetti fork ready for you.

30:45.911 --> 30:47.377

30:47.446 --> 30:48.679
- Hey, babe.
Come over here one second.

30:48.747 --> 30:50.747
I got to fix your hair
with these rollers, man.

30:50.816 --> 30:52.082
- Ay!

30:52.151 --> 30:53.350
- Hey, baby.

30:53.419 --> 30:54.451

31:01.327 --> 31:02.793
- Can I talk [bleep] about you?

31:02.862 --> 31:04.027
- You can talk [bleep]
about me.

31:04.096 --> 31:05.295
- I'll try my best.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.531
Yo, did you ever, like,

31:07.600 --> 31:10.133

I go full B-Rabbit,

31:40.165 --> 31:41.331
And word at the shore

31:41.400 --> 31:44.201

who gave Angelina herpes.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.436

31:46.505 --> 31:48.372

it was enough, fellas.

31:55.447 --> 31:56.480

31:56.548 --> 31:57.948
Were you nervous?
- A little bit?

31:58.017 --> 32:00.951
Yeah. I mean,
you guys are professionals.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.786
You do your thing.
We're not in that realm.

32:02.855 --> 32:04.187
- Yeah, I agree.
- So we were a little nervous.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.422
- We were in a restaurant.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.391
Like, we were just out to eat.
All of a sudden,

32:07.459 --> 32:10.127
you walk in with Nick Cannon
and clear the tables.

32:10.195 --> 32:11.528
- Yeah.
- To hand his microphones.

32:11.597 --> 32:12.996
- We're like, all right.
- That is crazy. Yeah.

32:13.065 --> 32:15.666
- Nick handed me the mic
and I handed it straight to Vin

32:15.734 --> 32:17.901
'cause I just didn't connect
to my brain to like...

32:17.970 --> 32:19.369
- Sink or swim.
- Roast my wife.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.004
- Yeah.
- And I just didn't do it.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.072
- That's a good man.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.740
- Speaking of, like,
public speaking,

32:23.809 --> 32:26.043
that would have been
my worst nightmare.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.277
- You killed the roasting thing

32:27.346 --> 32:28.445
at Angelina's wedding
though, so--

32:28.514 --> 32:29.980
- Yeah, that was dope.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.549
- Oh, my God. Vinny.
- [laughter]

32:32.618 --> 32:34.284
- No, she's divorced.
- Moving right along.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.353
- I was about to give you
like such a nice thing.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.055
I was going to say,
"Vinny did such a good job."

32:38.123 --> 32:39.523
- She's divorced, it's okay.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.058
- Yeah. Because of the speech.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.159
- All right. All right.

32:42.227 --> 32:44.061
So, Deena,
you have the reputation

32:44.129 --> 32:45.729
of being the nice one
in the house.

32:45.798 --> 32:48.799
And Wild 'N Out
is all about roasting.

32:48.867 --> 32:51.134
Honestly, I didn't know you had
a potty mouth like that.

32:51.203 --> 32:53.103
You had me dying.
- I really don't--

32:53.172 --> 32:54.204
- You know,
where did it come from?

32:54.273 --> 32:56.006
Was it just like
the drinks were flowing?

32:56.075 --> 32:57.140
- Drinks were flowing.
- Yeah.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.608
- And I wanted to win.

32:58.677 --> 33:00.444
And as everybody knows,
I'm very competitive.

33:00.512 --> 33:01.445
- She is. She is.
- There you go.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.246

for the throat.

- Little Miss No Gag Reflex.
- What is happening right now?

33:08.153 --> 33:11.188
- Angelina, the girls
defeated the fellas

33:11.256 --> 33:12.522
and took home the belt.

33:12.591 --> 33:15.592
How does it feel to know
you're funnier than them?

33:15.661 --> 33:16.893
- I loved it.
- We killed it.

33:16.962 --> 33:18.362
- Yeah.
- We did kill it.

33:18.430 --> 33:19.863
- Yeah. The girls cheated,
but it was good, it was good.

33:19.932 --> 33:23.300
- Well, if you're not cheating,
you're not trying, Pauly.

- Why didn't you honor the bet?

36:15.507 --> 36:18.408
- The bet was that I would
put a appreciation post.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.776
- Okay.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.711
- There was no bet
about what I can or cannot do

36:21.780 --> 36:24.714
on my social media page
after I posted that.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.082
- That's fair.

36:26.151 --> 36:27.517
- Should have been like,
"Oh, you're a dick. Ha, ha!"

36:27.586 --> 36:29.519
But, you know, instead it
turned into something way more.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.588
- You didn't have to go so--
you didn't have to do

36:31.657 --> 36:34.558
like, an extravagant thing.
That was on you.

36:34.626 --> 36:35.892
- I know I didn't have to.
Yeah.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.061
- So you did it on your own.
And then you just wanted

36:38.130 --> 36:40.797
to be a little dickhead
and take it back.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.799
- I'm sorry to break
the news to you.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.868
That love letter, I was JK.

36:44.937 --> 36:47.037
- I don't give a [bleep].
Nobody cares.

36:47.105 --> 36:48.305
- I was JK. I was JK.
- I don't care.

36:48.373 --> 36:49.372
- I was JK.

36:49.441 --> 36:50.907
- You're immature.
- I was JK.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.475
- I just thought that that was
very immature of him.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.945
He, like, literally didn't hold
up to his end of the bargain.

36:55.013 --> 36:57.047
- I thought I did.
We could agree to disagree.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.181
- Let me ask Mike--

36:58.250 --> 37:00.150
- It was an exclusivity clause.

37:00.219 --> 37:03.186
- Were you surprised
when Angelina went right

37:03.255 --> 37:05.855
to throwing water on Vinny?
Did that surprise you?

37:05.924 --> 37:07.324
- No.
- Threw water.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.292
- I was surprised when water
turned to wine. That's all.

37:09.394 --> 37:10.994
- Pauly, what went
through your mind

37:11.063 --> 37:13.797
when Nikki became
collateral damage?

37:13.865 --> 37:16.900
- Here's the situation,
water now turned into the wine.

37:16.969 --> 37:19.736
And then she did it
and then ran away.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.838
And so I was like, "Well, if
there's gonna be a fair fight,

37:21.907 --> 37:24.174
it should be wine on wine."
And then I opened the door.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.309
- Yeah, but whatever I found,
which was right next to me,

37:26.411 --> 37:28.612
I grabbed it
and then I just threw it.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.147
It's funny. Everyone here
is allowed to get intoxicated,

37:31.216 --> 37:33.250
Nicole, Deena,
but no one gives a [bleep].

37:33.318 --> 37:35.685
But when Angelina has
an intoxicated night,

37:35.754 --> 37:37.387
I'm getting judged
or I'm getting--

37:37.456 --> 37:38.755
- I have to do
a lot of apologies.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.290
- I'm not throwing wine
at people,

37:40.392 --> 37:41.558
and I always apologize.

37:41.627 --> 37:42.692
- I'm gonna say, I was like,
"Oh, [bleep]."

37:42.761 --> 37:43.994
Like, when I figured out
it was wine.

37:44.062 --> 37:45.195
- I always own up
to my nasty stuff.

37:45.264 --> 37:46.296
- Well, it was wine.
- That is not the truth.

37:46.398 --> 37:48.031
- Do not pull me
into this, bitch.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.767
- Pauly, we always see,
you know, the positive Pauly.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.969
I don't think
I've ever seen you angry.

37:53.038 --> 37:54.271
You know,
but we got a little glimpse.

37:54.339 --> 37:55.438
How's your shoulder feeling?
'Cause--

37:55.507 --> 37:57.107
- Shoulder's--
shoulder's good, but--

37:57.175 --> 37:58.508
- It's all right?

37:58.577 --> 38:00.076
- It was positive because where
I come from, like,

38:00.145 --> 38:02.012
I was brought up
that way to open a door

38:02.080 --> 38:03.313
for the lady.
- I love that.

38:03.382 --> 38:05.148
- I was opening the door
for my girlfriend.

38:05.217 --> 38:07.517
- That was very--
chivalry is not dead.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.185
- Chivalry is not dead.
- It is not dead.

38:09.254 --> 38:10.287
- Now, Vinny,
that must have been

38:10.355 --> 38:11.521
pretty hot
for you watching that.

38:11.590 --> 38:12.789
- Oh, my God.
- He ran out.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.491
Didn't you run out?
- That was hot, huh?

38:14.559 --> 38:16.092
- I mean, watching that
right now, watching that back.

38:16.161 --> 38:17.894
- I think he's [inaudible].
- We're gonna get you a towel.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.263
Coming up, Palm Sunday
has a whole new meaning

38:20.332 --> 38:22.932
when you're trying
to smoosh your priest.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.734
We're looking back
on the funniest moments

38:24.803 --> 38:26.303
from this season.

38:26.371 --> 38:27.837
[applause]

38:27.906 --> 38:29.172
- Whoo-hoo!

38:29.241 --> 38:32.442
- I did it and instantly
burned my tonsil.

38:32.511 --> 38:33.743
I didn't know what to do.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.345
So instead of swallowing it,
I spit it out.

38:35.447 --> 38:37.147
- You should never swallow.

38:37.215 --> 38:39.482
Angelina, were you really
contemplating

38:39.551 --> 38:40.784
smooshing the priest?

38:40.852 --> 38:42.886
- I mean--

Family Vacation Reunion."

38:55.200 --> 38:57.667
This family grows bigger
every year,

38:57.736 --> 39:00.570
but we recently lost
an irreplaceable member.

39:00.639 --> 39:03.139
After battling cancer,
Mike and Lauren's

39:03.208 --> 39:06.242
beloved dog Mosey passed away.
- Aw.

39:07.779 --> 39:11.414
He was such a big part of yoey.
life and such a beautiful dog.

39:11.483 --> 39:14.150
- Yeah. We were able to get
an additional seven months

39:14.219 --> 39:15.552
out of Mosey.

39:15.620 --> 39:18.355
The diagnosis was one to three.

39:18.423 --> 39:19.823
So we're very appreciative
and we cherish

39:19.925 --> 39:21.358
the moments that we had.

39:21.426 --> 39:23.460
I mean, he was an amazing dog.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.328
He really was.
He was like a family member.

39:25.397 --> 39:28.531
So he was so sweet
and so loving,

39:28.600 --> 39:30.100
and he was like
a big teddy bear.

39:30.168 --> 39:32.035
- And we know he's wagging
his tail up there in heaven.

39:32.104 --> 39:33.336
- Yeah.

39:33.405 --> 39:34.404
- We love you, Mosey,
and we miss you, buddy.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.705
- Mosey!
- RIP.

39:35.774 --> 39:38.174
- Let's pivot and end things
on a happier note.

39:38.243 --> 39:41.111
There were too many hilarious
moments from this season,

39:41.179 --> 39:45.181
so we treated them like boogers
in Angelina's nose

39:45.250 --> 39:46.316
and picked our favorites.

39:46.385 --> 39:47.384
Take a look.

39:47.452 --> 39:49.486
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

39:49.588 --> 39:51.454

39:51.523 --> 39:53.823

- Oh, my God.

39:53.892 --> 39:56.226
- Oh, my God! What is that?!
[laughter]

39:56.294 --> 39:58.061
Ah. It's burning my tongue.

39:58.130 --> 40:00.530
That tastes like [bleep].
No offense.

40:00.632 --> 40:01.631
- [burps]

40:01.700 --> 40:03.666
- Congratulations.
- Ew!

40:05.604 --> 40:07.404
- There was a sudden death
last night.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.839
Oh, ow!
- Oh, [bleep].

40:09.908 --> 40:11.408
- I snapped my Louboutin.

40:11.476 --> 40:12.809
We've been through
life together.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.511
These were my first pair.

40:14.579 --> 40:17.113
- People are dying.
- [bleep] off!

40:17.182 --> 40:18.448
- They might be adding
a little bit

40:18.517 --> 40:20.417
of jump rope flair
to Chippendales.

40:20.485 --> 40:21.785
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

40:21.853 --> 40:24.154
- Do you have to do
that choreo-graphy?

40:24.222 --> 40:26.656
- Choreo-graphy?
- It's choreo-graphy, yeah.

40:26.725 --> 40:29.125
- It's choreography.
[laughter]

40:29.194 --> 40:30.260
- I didn't get to meet you.

40:30.328 --> 40:31.594
- Father Rick. Father Rick.
- Yeah.

40:31.663 --> 40:32.896
- Father Jerome has told me
so much about you.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.097
- Thank you.

40:34.166 --> 40:35.331
- I feel for what you're
going through right now,

40:35.400 --> 40:36.766
so, you know--
- Yeah.

40:36.835 --> 40:38.935
- You can stop by
the mission some time and--

40:39.004 --> 40:40.503
- Definitely.
- Yeah.

40:40.572 --> 40:41.738
- Yeah. He asked me
to come back to the church.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.006
Nice to meet you.

40:43.074 --> 40:44.841
I can't friggin' date a priest.
Come on, me.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.676
No, that church
will be going up in flames.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.311
Some people gotta
get it in, right?

40:48.380 --> 40:50.447
- Oh, dear God.
- Oh, dear God.

40:50.515 --> 40:51.514
- He said, "Oh, dear God."

40:51.583 --> 40:52.949
- He said,
"Oh, no, they don't."

40:53.018 --> 40:55.552
- Now, Nicole, what was harder,
chugging an entire glass

40:55.654 --> 40:57.854
of rosé
or taking the ginger shot?

40:57.923 --> 40:59.088
- So I was, like, open to it.

40:59.157 --> 41:00.523
Nikki was like,
"You're gonna like it.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.592
Like, cleanses yourself."
I was like, "All right."

41:02.661 --> 41:05.495
And I go--first, I was like,
"Does Pauly do it?"

41:05.564 --> 41:07.597
'Cause me and Pauly
are, like, the same with foods.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.032
I was like,
"Does Pauly like it?"

41:09.100 --> 41:10.200
- And she was like, "Yeah,
he does it all the time."

41:10.268 --> 41:11.801
I was like,
"Okay, I'm gonna like it."

41:11.870 --> 41:15.104
And then I did it
and instantly burned my tonsil.

41:15.173 --> 41:16.473
I didn't know what to do.

41:16.541 --> 41:18.208
So instead of swallowing it,
I spit it out.

41:18.276 --> 41:20.844
- Spit it out.
You should never swallow.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.745
- I didn't like it. Yes.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.714
- Now, Angelina,
were you really

41:24.783 --> 41:27.050
contemplating
smooshing the priest?

41:27.118 --> 41:28.618
- I mean--
- Oh, my God!

41:28.720 --> 41:31.054
- Bitch! You're going to hell.

41:31.122 --> 41:32.055
- [inaudible].
- She's going to hell.

41:32.123 --> 41:33.389
- No, I was not.

41:33.458 --> 41:36.359
But it was nice to hear
a priest being so nice.

41:36.428 --> 41:39.262
- Does he still hit you up?
- He texts me.

41:39.331 --> 41:40.563
- You're an angel.
- Wow.

41:40.632 --> 41:42.866
- I'm like, "Holy [bleep]!
A priest likes me."

41:42.934 --> 41:45.502
- What's a priest's
favorite form of vagina?

41:45.570 --> 41:46.603
- I don't know. Do you know?

41:46.705 --> 41:48.137
- Ew!
- You should ask him.

41:48.206 --> 41:49.172
You should go hang out
with him and ask.

41:49.241 --> 41:50.940
- Go ahead, Vinny.
- None.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.309
- Let's go.
- Vin!

41:53.378 --> 41:54.511
- Yeah, you guys,
he landed one.

41:54.579 --> 41:56.112
He landed one today.

41:56.181 --> 41:57.413
- Vin, that was good.
- He landed one.

41:57.482 --> 41:58.414
- That was a good one.
- That was good.

41:58.483 --> 41:59.482
- Thank you.
- All right.

41:59.551 --> 42:00.950
- Thank you.
- That was good.

42:01.019 --> 42:03.052
- Well, another epic
