00:02.705 --> 00:04.905
Here it is.

00:04.907 --> 00:06.206
Here it is, Ralph.

00:06.208 --> 00:08.841
<i> Super Fun Guy</i>
<i> vs. Dr. Power Pants:</i>

00:08.843 --> 00:10.108
<i> When Khakis Attacki.</i>

00:10.110 --> 00:11.509
It's a little bit beat up,

00:11.511 --> 00:12.610
but it's perfect
for your time capsule.

00:12.612 --> 00:14.578
Thanks, Sylvester.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.096
Don't thank him.

00:16.097 --> 00:17.613
Everyone in 2065
will think we're dorks.

00:17.616 --> 00:19.515
Here we go!

00:19.517 --> 00:21.617
Stick this
in your memory box, buddy.

00:21.619 --> 00:23.685
What's that?
It's me, graduation day.

00:23.687 --> 00:25.019
PAIGE:
Wow, elementary school?

00:25.021 --> 00:26.820
High school, valedictorian.

00:26.822 --> 00:29.589
This photo represents excellence
in the field of superiority.

00:29.591 --> 00:32.091
Suck on that, future people!

00:32.093 --> 00:33.892
You were cute.
What happened?

00:35.762 --> 00:37.528
Okay, put this in.

00:37.530 --> 00:38.529
Nuts have held
the world together

00:38.531 --> 00:40.831
since the Industrial Revolution.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.098
And in 100 years,
it will be the only thing

00:42.100 --> 00:44.066
left inside this box
that is worth anything.

00:44.068 --> 00:46.735
WALTER:
Morning, guys.

00:46.737 --> 00:49.804
What do we have... here?

00:49.806 --> 00:51.105
Time capsule project for school.

00:51.107 --> 00:52.139
It's due Friday.

00:52.141 --> 00:53.173
Want to contribute?

00:53.175 --> 00:55.241
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:55.243 --> 00:57.243
Should be called
waste-of-time capsule.

00:57.245 --> 00:59.178
That's clever.

00:59.180 --> 01:00.846
(car horn honks)
Oh, Mrs. Goldberg.

01:00.848 --> 01:02.747
Give me a kiss. Mwah.

01:02.749 --> 01:05.716
Okay, have a great day.

01:08.687 --> 01:10.053
He has to do all his
assignments, you know.

01:10.055 --> 01:11.621
Not just math and science.

01:11.623 --> 01:13.289
They are teaching children
that there is value

01:13.291 --> 01:16.091
to revisiting the past when it
is the future that is important.

01:16.093 --> 01:19.627
You don't think there's value
in looking back once in a while?

01:19.629 --> 01:21.629
Do you know why sharks are the
most efficient ocean predator?

01:21.631 --> 01:23.130
Because they always
move forward.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.567
SYLVESTER:
Happy, it's perfect.

01:27.569 --> 01:29.835
Titanium steel,
unbreakable glass.

01:29.837 --> 01:32.838
Take it for a spin.

01:32.840 --> 01:34.673
PAIGE: Amazing work--
I love the hearts.

01:34.675 --> 01:35.907
Only thing I hate
more than hearts

01:35.909 --> 01:37.775
is anything frilly or pink.

01:37.777 --> 01:39.643
But for Megan,
I made an exception.

01:39.645 --> 01:40.944
How you holding up, Sly?

01:40.946 --> 01:43.079
I miss her every day.

01:43.081 --> 01:45.914
But it's been six weeks,
so I'm pushing forward.

01:47.951 --> 01:49.050
Hey, hey, Walter?

01:49.052 --> 01:50.217
You know,
I have a lovely picture

01:50.219 --> 01:51.969
of you and Megan for you.

01:51.970 --> 01:53.720
No, thanks.
I know what we both look like.

01:59.861 --> 02:03.629
My pal in evidence
says you're lucky

02:03.631 --> 02:05.864
the city doesn't clean
out their storage.

02:05.866 --> 02:08.867
Oh, perfect!

02:12.138 --> 02:13.237
What the hell is that?

02:13.239 --> 02:14.638
It's liquid glycerin.

02:14.640 --> 02:16.640
Once it hardens,
any air leakage

02:16.642 --> 02:18.908
from the tank would
create a bubble pattern,

02:18.910 --> 02:21.110
showing Ray's partner's
tank was defective

02:21.112 --> 02:23.112
and his death
was not Ray's fault.

02:23.114 --> 02:24.913
But forensics already
tested that tank, Walt.

02:24.915 --> 02:26.814
Twice.

02:26.816 --> 02:29.049
Testing's progressed a great
deal in the last ten years.

02:29.051 --> 02:30.917
Plus I'm smarter than they were.

02:30.919 --> 02:32.852
TOBY: Is it now when
the psychiatrist says

02:32.854 --> 02:34.854
it's not a good idea to dig
into someone else's tragedy?

02:34.856 --> 02:36.755
Ray blames himself
for his partner's death,

02:36.757 --> 02:38.823
and it's affected
his life negatively.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.825
It's inefficient
to live in the past

02:40.827 --> 02:43.127
and compromise
present productivity.

02:43.129 --> 02:44.795
Is that why,
in a month and a half,

02:44.797 --> 02:45.962
you've barely mentioned Megan?

02:45.964 --> 02:48.698
Barely had any
reaction at all?

02:48.700 --> 02:49.999
I'm out of here.

02:50.001 --> 02:52.067
I need a coffee.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.673
I was, uh, very put-off

03:01.675 --> 03:03.175
by my sister's passing.

03:03.176 --> 03:04.676
You're put-off
by a parking ticket.

03:04.678 --> 03:06.344
You grieve
when your sister dies.

03:06.346 --> 03:08.312
This has nothing to do with me.

03:08.314 --> 03:10.097
This is about Ray.

03:10.098 --> 03:11.881
He has barely left
the camper lately.

03:11.884 --> 03:13.250
And I think it's
because the anniversary

03:13.252 --> 03:15.185
of his partner's death
is coming up soon.

03:15.187 --> 03:16.352
I can help him.

03:16.354 --> 03:17.519
And I'm thrilled
that you're noticing

03:17.521 --> 03:19.187
other people's feelings.

03:19.189 --> 03:21.189
I... I just worry

03:21.191 --> 03:23.157
that you're focusing
on someone else's pain

03:23.159 --> 03:24.424
to avoid your own.

03:24.426 --> 03:27.360
Well, I can't avoid
what isn't there.

03:27.362 --> 03:28.728
CABE:
Walt, Cooper's here!

03:28.730 --> 03:29.829
She's got a hot one.

03:29.831 --> 03:31.897
Let's go.

03:33.233 --> 03:35.266
Last week, the Department
of the Interior

03:35.268 --> 03:37.935
was infiltrated by
sophisticated ransomware,

03:37.937 --> 03:40.470
which resulted
in a complete system shutdown

03:40.472 --> 03:42.405
we could not undo until we met

03:42.407 --> 03:44.206
the demands
of the unknown hacker.

03:44.208 --> 03:45.891
Why didn't you call us?

03:45.892 --> 03:47.575
Demand was only 20 grand.
Deadline was tight.

03:47.578 --> 03:49.678
Possibility of PR fallout.
We paid it.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.513
Morons.
That's unfair.

03:51.515 --> 03:53.365
Yeah, to morons.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.216
They demanded a small amount
'cause it was a test run.

03:55.218 --> 03:56.383
Would the ransomware work?

03:56.385 --> 03:57.917
Yep, would you fold
like a lawn chair?

03:57.919 --> 04:00.519
Yep.
So there's another ransom?

04:00.521 --> 04:02.654
As of yesterday,
except now they're threatening

04:02.656 --> 04:04.656
to shut down the Federal Reserve

04:04.658 --> 04:07.325
if they don't receive a quarter
billion dollars in bitcoin

04:07.327 --> 04:09.760
within the next 72 hours.

04:09.762 --> 04:12.596
They even sent
their own countdown.

04:12.598 --> 04:14.664
Not good.
Whoever did this doesn't grasp

04:14.666 --> 04:16.399
the implications
of a Federal Reserve shutdown.

04:16.401 --> 04:18.834
If they did, they'd know they'd
be as screwed as the rest of us.

04:18.836 --> 04:20.368
What exactly are
the implications?

04:20.370 --> 04:21.502
WALTER: The Fed
is where the banks

04:21.504 --> 04:23.170
keep their reserves.

04:23.171 --> 04:24.837
A shutdown would set off
a toxic chain reaction.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.573
Every bank, from conglomerates

04:26.575 --> 04:28.975
to small S and L's
would need to shut down, too.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.343
Then foreign economies
lose confidence

04:30.345 --> 04:31.577
and refuse to lend to us.

04:31.579 --> 04:34.246
That means a huge
devaluation of the dollar.

04:34.248 --> 04:35.747
Driving investors
to other currencies.

04:35.749 --> 04:36.914
U.S. would have no more credit

04:36.916 --> 04:38.882
and be unable
to afford imports.

04:38.884 --> 04:40.750
Which leaves us with a high
demand for and a low supply

04:40.752 --> 04:43.252
of goods like food and gas

04:43.254 --> 04:44.386
and other necessities.

04:44.388 --> 04:45.987
Global panic sets in
within days.

04:45.989 --> 04:47.655
Our economy reverts to one

04:47.657 --> 04:49.523
where food growers
barter for services.

04:49.525 --> 04:51.791
I hate computers.

04:51.793 --> 04:53.726
That's why I need you
to get into the Fed's server

04:53.728 --> 04:55.461
and kill this ransomware.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.429
I'm already in
and it's-it's not happening.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.531
Every time I try and break
the code, it changes.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.467
It's as if it's adapting.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.734
Walter can't get in.

05:03.736 --> 05:06.236
Can I start hoarding
cans of food now, please?

05:06.238 --> 05:07.604
You don't have any other leads?

05:07.606 --> 05:08.972
COOPER:
The NSA picked up

05:08.974 --> 05:10.707
some suspicious
encrypted e-mails,

05:10.709 --> 05:13.242
which they ran through
linguistics software.

05:13.244 --> 05:16.612
There was one match to the
blog posts of Terence Cooley,

05:16.614 --> 05:19.514
an Oceanside University
computer science professor.

05:19.516 --> 05:20.948
Agents discovered
him shot dead

05:20.950 --> 05:22.649
in his apartment
three hours ago.

05:22.651 --> 05:24.784
Tech ran his laptop.

05:24.786 --> 05:26.836
Nothing related
to the ransomware.

05:26.837 --> 05:28.887
But what we do have is
a starting point-- the campus.

05:28.890 --> 05:31.891
And if you look
carefully enough... bingo!

05:31.893 --> 05:34.260
I found a ghosted entry path
to the Fed's server

05:34.262 --> 05:35.961
uploaded from a computer

05:35.963 --> 05:38.263
at the school
student activity center.

05:38.265 --> 05:39.530
How does that help?

05:39.532 --> 05:40.998
The dead prof could've
done the upload.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.532
Checking that possibility now,

05:42.534 --> 05:44.300
and at the time of the upload,

05:44.302 --> 05:46.468
Professor Cooley
was teaching a class.

05:46.470 --> 05:49.370
There is a video online
of the lecture.

05:49.372 --> 05:51.305
So someone who was at the
activities center at the time

05:51.307 --> 05:54.641
uploaded the ransomware
to the Federal Reserve.

05:54.643 --> 05:56.309
According
to the center's register,

05:56.311 --> 05:57.677
the space was reserved that day

05:57.679 --> 05:59.311
by a psych department meeting,

05:59.313 --> 06:00.979
a drama club gathering,

06:00.981 --> 06:02.981
the wrestling team's luncheon

06:02.982 --> 06:04.982
and an assembly
of the Sisters of Pi Upsilon.

06:04.985 --> 06:06.551
Oh, I was in Pi Up.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.052
What? I-I was.

06:09.054 --> 06:11.521
Campus security's offices
are also in the basement,

06:11.523 --> 06:13.556
which means anyone
from any one of those groups

06:13.558 --> 06:15.457
could've uploaded
the ransomware.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.358
I bet Walt and I
could design a DFS

06:17.360 --> 06:19.059
that could sniff out
the device used to send it.

06:19.061 --> 06:20.994
It's a digital
fingerprint scanner.

06:20.996 --> 06:22.395
Each brand
of electronics emits

06:22.397 --> 06:25.564
its own unique
electromagnetic field.

06:25.566 --> 06:27.332
I can tell
from the upload pattern

06:27.334 --> 06:28.533
that a Toshoki-brand device
was used.

06:28.535 --> 06:30.001
Okay, so we build the DFSes.

06:30.003 --> 06:31.502
You give them
to Homeland agents,

06:31.504 --> 06:33.537
who go undercover
on campus.

06:33.539 --> 06:35.038
And they will get a ping

06:35.040 --> 06:37.907
when they get close to someone
with a Toshoki product.

06:37.909 --> 06:39.675
And then we detain
just that person

06:39.677 --> 06:41.576
and then confiscate that device.

06:41.578 --> 06:43.411
And if it's the device
we're looking for,

06:43.413 --> 06:44.979
it'll have the original
ransomware code on it.

06:44.981 --> 06:47.548
Walter will reverse-engineer it
and shut it down.

06:47.550 --> 06:49.349
Solid plan,
except agents won't know

06:49.351 --> 06:51.317
how to handle technical snafus.

06:51.319 --> 06:53.052
SYLVESTER:
Oh, no!

06:53.054 --> 06:54.720
I am not going
back to college!

06:54.722 --> 06:56.521
College was the worst
six months of my life.

06:56.523 --> 06:58.623
I'm in and I'm gonna
do it right this time.

06:58.625 --> 07:01.092
College sucked hard
for 14-year-old Tobias Curtis.

07:01.094 --> 07:02.827
Guys, college is fun.

07:02.829 --> 07:04.895
College is a continued
adolescence factory,

07:04.897 --> 07:06.830
where parents subsidize
years of nonsense,

07:06.832 --> 07:09.365
instead of serious
academic rigor.

07:09.367 --> 07:10.933
Yeah, fun.

07:10.935 --> 07:12.801
All right, look,
we got a ticking clock.

07:12.803 --> 07:14.602
All right?
So suck it up.

07:14.604 --> 07:16.470
We're gonna infiltrate

07:16.472 --> 07:18.405
each one of those
campus groups

07:18.407 --> 07:20.473
and find the device
that uploaded the code,

07:20.475 --> 07:22.074
period.

07:22.076 --> 07:24.342
Let's get ready for school.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.477
Have you ever wrestled?

07:27.479 --> 07:30.079
With my emotions.
Down on all fours.

07:30.081 --> 07:32.648
Nothing good has ever started
with that sentence.

07:32.650 --> 07:34.716
Okay, so this is the

07:56.703 --> 07:58.002
It's what they wear.

07:58.004 --> 07:59.903
I didn't go to college

07:59.905 --> 08:01.471
Don't forget the sweater.

08:12.381 --> 08:14.080
we've arranged for Cabe
to fill a trainee slot

08:14.082 --> 08:15.815
with campus security.

08:15.817 --> 08:17.883
Walter, you're gonna
be a guest instructor

08:17.885 --> 08:20.585
for the drama club, visiting
from Baker Lake University

08:20.587 --> 08:22.420
in Canada.

08:22.422 --> 08:23.771
And, Doc,

08:23.772 --> 08:25.121
you are going to be
applying for a job

08:25.124 --> 08:26.774
as a professor in
the psych department.

08:26.775 --> 08:28.425
The hardest thing will be for me
to not actually get hired.

08:28.427 --> 08:29.492
No, no, no, no way!

08:29.494 --> 08:31.894
Quincy Berkstead?
I won't do this!

08:31.896 --> 08:33.595
Uh-oh.
What's the problem?

08:33.597 --> 08:34.929
Uh, well,
it seems Toby has

08:34.931 --> 08:36.430
to apply for a job
from his old nemesis.

08:36.432 --> 08:37.898
Quincy Berkstead
stole my fiancée!

08:37.900 --> 08:39.799
I can't ask Wimpy
Jerkhead for a job.

08:39.801 --> 08:41.133
What do you care?
You like Happy.

08:41.135 --> 08:42.601
It's a matter of pride.

08:42.603 --> 08:44.436
Then swallow it.
If I got to be a rent-a-cop

08:44.438 --> 08:45.837
and Sylvester's got to get
the crap beat out of him...

08:45.839 --> 08:47.171
What?!

08:47.173 --> 08:48.772
...then you can man up
and get the job done.

08:48.774 --> 08:49.939
Now,

08:49.941 --> 08:52.441
inspection in 15 minutes.

08:52.443 --> 08:55.944
Susie Lee, hopeful rushee
of the Pi Upsilon sorority.

08:55.946 --> 08:57.712
Present.

08:57.714 --> 08:59.647
Drama instructor
Vern Portnoy?

08:59.649 --> 09:00.848
Here.

09:00.850 --> 09:02.416
Walk-on wrestler
Sam Paley?

09:02.418 --> 09:03.683
I'm against this.

09:03.685 --> 09:05.818
Security Officer
Galbreath?

09:05.820 --> 09:07.503
Accounted for.

09:07.504 --> 09:09.187
And Dr. Tobias M. Curtis,
applicant for position

09:09.190 --> 09:11.456
in Professor Quincy Berkstead's
Psychology Department.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.191
(blows raspberry)

09:13.193 --> 09:15.159
So, Paige, what
do you think?

09:15.161 --> 09:19.463
Now I know why you guys had
such a hard time in college.

09:21.900 --> 09:24.967
♪ ♪

09:33.177 --> 09:34.676
Lovely.

09:34.678 --> 09:35.677
Wow.

09:35.679 --> 09:37.879
You know,
would it kill Homeland

09:37.881 --> 09:39.981
to get us a nice
hotel room for once?

09:39.983 --> 09:42.049
Okay, everyone grab a scanner.

09:42.051 --> 09:44.051
They're temperamental.
You might get a hit a few feet

09:44.053 --> 09:46.053
from someone or you might have
to be right on top of them.

09:46.055 --> 09:47.654
WALTER:
Software is running.

09:47.656 --> 09:49.756
Now, if we get near
the electromagnetic field

09:49.758 --> 09:51.724
of a Toshoki device,
you will get

09:51.726 --> 09:54.593
a visual and audio response
like this.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.595
(beeping)

09:56.597 --> 09:58.029
And you'll let us know
when we strike oil?

09:58.031 --> 09:59.897
Got it.
Everyone got their comms in?

09:59.899 --> 10:01.498
I got more than my comms.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.699
I got my bucket list.

10:02.701 --> 10:03.766
I'm making college
count this time.

10:03.768 --> 10:05.801
I checked the event calendar.

10:05.803 --> 10:06.868
There's a Hacky-Sack-a-thon
in the quad,

10:06.870 --> 10:08.736
naked fountain run
in a few hours,

10:08.738 --> 10:10.170
and there's a winter dance
at Adelphi Hall.

10:10.172 --> 10:11.804
SYLVESTER:
I saw the astrophysics lab

10:11.806 --> 10:13.839
has an exhibit
on vintage spacesuits.

10:13.841 --> 10:15.640
I'd love to check that out.

10:15.642 --> 10:16.707
Nerd.

10:16.709 --> 10:18.175
Put your plans on
hold because Sly

10:18.177 --> 10:19.609
has to get to the
wrestling fraternity,

10:19.611 --> 10:21.210
Happy has to
go rush Pi Up,

10:21.212 --> 10:22.844
Cabe's meeting his
supervisor in 20 minutes,

10:22.846 --> 10:24.545
Walter's got a
class to teach,

10:24.547 --> 10:26.680
and, Toby, you've got a
job interview coming up.

10:27.883 --> 10:29.916
You heard her.
Let's get to it.

10:29.918 --> 10:32.818
♪ We gonna step up in the booth
like it's the first time... ♪

10:32.820 --> 10:33.819
I'm here.

10:33.821 --> 10:35.153
These are the guys who ruined

10:35.155 --> 10:37.155
the elastic
in my underwear growing up.

10:37.157 --> 10:39.657
Play the part
and go find that device.

10:39.659 --> 10:41.725
(clears throat)

10:42.794 --> 10:45.261
Hello.

10:45.263 --> 10:46.762
My name is Sam Paley.

10:46.764 --> 10:48.697
I am a transfer student
looking to

10:48.699 --> 10:50.632
try out for the wrestling team.

10:50.634 --> 10:51.799
My JC coach
should've called you

10:51.801 --> 10:53.167
to let you know
that I'd be coming by.

10:53.169 --> 10:54.635
Yeah, he totally did, bro.

10:54.637 --> 10:56.970
I'm Craig. My house name's Toad.

10:56.972 --> 10:59.906
This is Skid Mark, Muskrat,
Stinky and the Gooch.

10:59.908 --> 11:01.908
Nice to meet you, the Gooch.

11:01.910 --> 11:03.242
Your timing's perfect--
today's team photo day.

11:03.244 --> 11:05.244
You can say cheese
with the rest of us.

11:05.246 --> 11:07.145
Well, thank you for making me
feel so welcome.

11:07.147 --> 11:09.147
(chuckles)
Hey, wrestlers for life.

11:09.149 --> 11:10.748
Right, Tyrannosaurus Sex?

11:10.750 --> 11:12.816
That'll be your house name
'cause you're big and sexy.

11:12.818 --> 11:14.617
(laughs)

11:14.619 --> 11:15.918
All right, let's get
this party started.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.269
Yeah, yeah.

11:17.270 --> 11:18.619
This is awesome--
you can get near every member

11:18.622 --> 11:19.832
of the team at once,

11:19.833 --> 11:21.043
and if they have
a phone or device

11:21.044 --> 11:22.254
that matches what we're looking
for, we'll know right away.

11:22.258 --> 11:23.924
Let's get Sam right
in the middle there,

11:23.926 --> 11:25.792
make him feel
real welcome.

11:25.794 --> 11:28.728
Okeydokey, Toad.
(chuckles)

11:28.730 --> 11:31.197
Okay, uh, tradition is
we link arms together

11:31.199 --> 11:33.032
in a wrestling lock. Oh,
okay, whatever you say.

11:33.034 --> 11:34.566
(clears throat)

11:34.568 --> 11:35.833
And... now!

11:35.835 --> 11:38.836
(laughing, whooping)

11:38.838 --> 11:40.838
(groans)

11:40.840 --> 11:41.839
Aah!

11:41.841 --> 11:43.173
(laughing)

11:43.175 --> 11:44.707

11:44.709 --> 11:46.642
Freshly worn
jocks, bro.

11:46.644 --> 11:47.776
(laughs)

11:47.778 --> 11:49.110
We don't take transfers.

11:49.112 --> 11:50.277
Now beat it.

11:50.279 --> 11:51.678
That sounds bad.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.146
Worse, your scanner
didn't catch a ping.

11:53.148 --> 11:55.615
Well, I think I just
caught hepatitis.

11:55.617 --> 11:58.017
My college experience
has not changed.

11:58.019 --> 11:59.551
Walter, how are things with you?

11:59.553 --> 12:01.185
Your frequency strength's shaky.

12:01.187 --> 12:03.754
So we're getting nothing.

12:03.756 --> 12:04.888
Uh, we're so sorry.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.823
Uh, we'll dig deeper.

12:06.825 --> 12:08.291
Oh, no, you're
confused, I...

12:08.293 --> 12:09.759
We're missing the
scene's meaning?

12:09.761 --> 12:12.161
No, I was talking to myself,
not you guys.

12:13.831 --> 12:16.565
What?

12:16.567 --> 12:18.133
You referred
to us as "guys."

12:18.135 --> 12:19.667
I'm a woman.

12:19.669 --> 12:22.136
It's just a mistake
your generation sometimes makes,

12:22.138 --> 12:24.304
defining with
gender-dominant labels.

12:24.306 --> 12:26.205
<i> I</i> made a mistake?

12:26.207 --> 12:27.206
Walter, these are
drama students.

12:27.208 --> 12:29.942
They are nothing but EQ,

12:29.944 --> 12:31.076
and their PC is
all about sensitivity,

12:31.078 --> 12:33.011
so just be patient with them.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.345
No, I wasn't mistaken.

12:34.347 --> 12:35.879
<i> Webster's Dictionary</i> states

12:35.881 --> 12:37.614
that "guys" may be
used in plural

12:37.615 --> 12:39.348
to refer to members of a group
regardless of sex.

12:39.351 --> 12:41.150
More than two is a group.

12:41.152 --> 12:42.885
Stop debating, get near them,

12:42.887 --> 12:44.019
and let your scanner
do its thing.

12:44.021 --> 12:46.021
Your term choice is
a microaggression.

12:46.023 --> 12:47.889
Well, if it's "micro,"
why is it a problem?

12:47.891 --> 12:49.824
Walter, there's nothing coming
over your scanner.

12:49.826 --> 12:51.309
The device isn't there.

12:51.310 --> 12:52.793
You can stop fighting
with the students and leave.

12:52.795 --> 12:54.060
Okay, time for me to go.

12:54.062 --> 12:56.796
Good, and take
your trigger words with you.

12:56.798 --> 12:58.130
You know what,
uh, as your teacher,

12:58.132 --> 13:00.866
let me leave you
with some guidance.

13:00.868 --> 13:03.134
You're spoiled, coddled
and wasting your time.

13:03.136 --> 13:04.668
Study science, math,
go to vocational school,

13:04.670 --> 13:06.670
or learn a trade,
because statistically you have

13:06.672 --> 13:09.139
less than a .01 chance
of making it as an actor,

13:09.141 --> 13:10.673
and based on what
I've seen today,

13:10.675 --> 13:12.041
it's even less than that.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.810
Okay, have a good day.

Yeah, that was awesome.

13:29.389 --> 13:32.056
So I speak on behalf
of all Pi Ups

13:32.058 --> 13:34.124
when I say you guys would
make great sisters.

13:34.126 --> 13:36.659
But space is limited.

13:36.661 --> 13:38.127
So we're gonna start the rush
speed-date circuit,

13:38.129 --> 13:40.162
where you guys get to know us
and we get to know you.

13:40.164 --> 13:43.765
Now, some of the questions
might be wacky, so look out.

13:43.767 --> 13:45.900
Okay, groups of two,
move about the house,

13:45.902 --> 13:47.167
and meet the sisters
of Pi Upsilon.

13:47.169 --> 13:48.735

13:51.239 --> 13:52.972
PAIGE:
Happy, this is your shot.

13:52.974 --> 13:54.406
You can get through most

13:54.408 --> 13:56.007
of the sorority house
within the hour.

13:56.009 --> 13:57.408
Peachy.

13:58.844 --> 14:00.977
Why do you want to go Pi Up?

14:00.979 --> 14:04.246
School spirit, to help
with your great charitable work,

14:04.248 --> 14:06.248
and, of course, sisterhood.

14:06.250 --> 14:09.951
I need a place to live, and this
house has decent craftsmanship.

14:09.953 --> 14:11.536
Happy, no.

14:11.537 --> 14:13.120
If you could have dinner
with any celebrity,

14:13.122 --> 14:14.121
who would it be?

14:14.123 --> 14:15.989
Elon Musk.

14:15.991 --> 14:17.256
Ryan Gosling.

14:17.258 --> 14:18.890
Who's that?

14:18.892 --> 14:20.892
What superpower
do you wish you had?

14:20.894 --> 14:22.026
To talk to animals.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.894
I love pets.

14:23.896 --> 14:26.997
At this very moment--
teleportation.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.032
Okay, I'm-I'm still getting
squat on the software.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.967
Keep it up. I'm gonna
check with Toby.

14:31.903 --> 14:34.270
Hi, um, Susie.

14:34.272 --> 14:36.805
I was wondering,
can I ask you something?

14:36.807 --> 14:38.340
More questions.

14:38.341 --> 14:39.874
Great, what would you like
to know, Mavis?

14:39.876 --> 14:40.875
Okay.

14:40.877 --> 14:44.078
Um... why are you here?

14:45.781 --> 14:48.248
Lots of us are away from home
for the first time.

14:48.250 --> 14:49.916
I am.

14:49.918 --> 14:51.918
And I miss my real sisters.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.787
And I think this place
might be good for me.

14:54.789 --> 14:58.857
And everyone here is
so nice... except you.

14:58.859 --> 15:01.860
You're kind of mean
and sarcastic.

15:05.966 --> 15:07.966
Have you ever gotten homesick?

15:07.968 --> 15:10.468
Wouldn't it be nice to have
a surrogate family?

15:12.839 --> 15:15.840
I've thought about it
from time to time.

15:15.842 --> 15:18.309
Well, you can't truly have one

15:18.311 --> 15:20.978
until you lower
that shield of yours.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.912
That's all.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.384
TOBY:
<i> It's demeaning.</i>

15:28.386 --> 15:30.386
Plus I didn't get
to Hacky my Sack,

15:30.388 --> 15:32.421
and I'm presently missing the naked
fountain run. PAIGE: Too bad.

15:32.423 --> 15:34.956
Now walk into the interview,
meet with the psych department,

15:34.958 --> 15:37.458
and hopefully we can get a hit
and end this madness.

15:37.460 --> 15:39.993
I want the record to note
that I would never, in reality,

15:39.995 --> 15:41.461
apply for a job
from Quincy Berkstead.

15:41.463 --> 15:45.131
Okay, I'm... noting it
on your file.

15:45.133 --> 15:47.066
Don't patronize me.

15:52.973 --> 15:55.039
Sorry you had to hear that.

15:55.041 --> 15:58.108
I am just having
a stressful day.

15:58.110 --> 15:59.843
You work
in the psych department?

15:59.845 --> 16:01.845
Not really, just helping them
with a study

16:01.847 --> 16:04.981
of how a positive attitude
affects athletic performance.

16:04.983 --> 16:08.317
Oh, man, you're Willie McGinest
from the Patriots.

16:08.319 --> 16:10.852
That's right, and if you
don't mind me saying,

16:10.854 --> 16:13.054
your negativity could use
a little adjustment.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.922
I'm normally not that cranky.

16:14.924 --> 16:16.790
I-I just have a stupid
job interview.

16:16.792 --> 16:18.792
Never gonna get the position
with that mindset.

16:18.794 --> 16:21.394
You know how I got the NFL
record for postseason sacks?

16:21.396 --> 16:23.996
I have to assume,
that expanded playoff schedule.

16:23.998 --> 16:25.964
I mean, a team plays
that many extra games,

16:25.966 --> 16:27.298
statistically speaking,

16:27.300 --> 16:29.300
eventually someone's gonna
break that record.

16:29.302 --> 16:31.435
Anyone.

16:33.138 --> 16:36.139
You were gonna say "positive
attitude," weren't you?

16:36.141 --> 16:38.407

16:50.853 --> 16:54.421

16:54.423 --> 16:56.189
Told them not to come.

16:56.191 --> 17:00.193
You applying for this job
is passive-aggressive.

17:00.195 --> 17:01.994
I don't know what point
you're trying to make,

17:01.996 --> 17:03.996
but we're both doctors.

17:03.998 --> 17:05.998
I'm a doctor,
you're a psychologist.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.332
Take it easy.

17:07.334 --> 17:10.101
You must be here for a reason,
taking up my time.

17:10.103 --> 17:12.103
T-Taking your time?

17:12.105 --> 17:15.172

Fiancée.

get along with anyone else?

17:17.109 --> 17:20.409

about all this.

saw our skills,

asked if we wanted

Cooley said he had a
friend named Ryder.

22:39.226 --> 22:41.092
They studied programming
together, back in the day.

22:41.094 --> 22:43.160
Ryder wanted to hire someone

22:59.242 --> 23:01.320
Top secret.
Only Professor Cooley

23:01.321 --> 23:03.399
and maybe two other school
officials knew about it.

23:07.483 --> 23:09.382
if we are going up
against a quantum.

23:09.384 --> 23:12.251
What's a quantum? Quantum
computers are extremely rare.

23:12.253 --> 23:16.321
At any time, maybe three or four
of them exist on the planet

23:16.323 --> 23:18.323
at top government research labs
or universities.

23:18.325 --> 23:19.758
Totally hush-hush.

23:19.759 --> 23:21.192
Unlike standard
binary computers,

23:21.194 --> 23:24.328
quantums transmit data
using precision lasers.

23:24.330 --> 23:27.364
Billions of times faster than
even today's top processors.

23:27.366 --> 23:28.698
That's why the ransomware
kept adapting

23:28.700 --> 23:30.232
when I was trying to hack it.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.267
No human can outthink
a quantum, not even me.

23:32.269 --> 23:35.270
But these lasers are as unstable
as they are fast.

23:35.272 --> 23:37.772
Some last a few days,
at most, a couple weeks.

23:37.774 --> 23:40.441
So Ryder paid to have
the ransomware built,

23:40.443 --> 23:42.776
and his pal Cooley had access
to a supercomputer,

23:42.778 --> 23:44.377
and he could pull it off
without getting caught.

23:44.379 --> 23:46.379

we're on to him,

my anti-code

24:06.196 --> 24:07.962
directly into the quantum,

24:07.963 --> 24:09.729
then it can run as fast
as the ransomware itself

24:09.732 --> 24:10.764

let's just smash it

25:05.680 --> 25:07.212
No, if we do,
the ransomware

25:07.214 --> 25:09.247
will stay embedded
in the Fed's server.

25:09.249 --> 25:10.749
It'll keep running,

25:10.750 --> 25:12.250
and before we know it,
our economy collapses.

25:12.252 --> 25:15.386
Our only hope is
to slow the quantum down

25:15.388 --> 25:17.388
so that I can upload
my anti-code

25:17.390 --> 25:18.722
to shut down the ransomware.

25:18.724 --> 25:21.191
Now, to do that,
we need to insert a mirror

25:21.193 --> 25:24.194
to reflect back one
of those lasers on itself,

25:24.196 --> 25:26.663
so that we can reduce
the quantum's power

25:26.665 --> 25:28.264
from four qubits to two.

25:28.266 --> 25:30.266
We'll have to drill
through the Plexiglas

25:30.268 --> 25:33.302
while maintaining the vacuum
seal, 'cause if the seal breaks,

25:33.304 --> 25:35.737
the computer collapses
and the ransomware survives.

25:35.739 --> 25:37.371
How do you do that?

25:37.373 --> 25:39.272
You pour butane
over the drill.

25:39.274 --> 25:41.240
It should seal the cracks
between the drill and the glass

25:41.242 --> 25:42.574
and maintain the vacuum.

25:42.576 --> 25:43.975
Easier said than done.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.375
That room is kept

25:46.879 --> 25:49.346
negative 100 degrees Celsius.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.581
If your drill gets too hot,
and the temperature increases

25:51.583 --> 25:54.817
by more than .3 degrees,
it'll kill the computer.

25:54.819 --> 25:57.352
I'll wrap it in insulation
I pull from the wall.

25:57.354 --> 25:59.421
Insulation won't work
on your body.

25:59.422 --> 26:01.489
At negative 100 degrees Celsius,
you'll die in seconds.

26:01.491 --> 26:04.492
Uh, speaking of death,
if I drill too fast,

26:04.494 --> 26:06.360
we get a friction spark,

26:06.362 --> 26:09.262
exploding the gases
in the cube, and we die.

26:09.264 --> 26:11.597
Not to mention
if there's too much vibration

26:11.599 --> 26:12.931
or a large sound wave,

26:12.933 --> 26:15.934
then the quantum's lasers
will jostle and explode,

26:15.936 --> 26:17.335
and we die.

26:17.337 --> 26:19.003
TOBY:
You guys have fun.

26:19.005 --> 26:20.804
I'll be up here in
the observation room.

26:20.806 --> 26:23.339
22 minutes until
economic meltdown.

26:23.341 --> 26:24.473
We need to get in there.

26:24.475 --> 26:27.576
How... when it's
100 degrees below zero?

26:29.446 --> 26:31.312
Remember when you called me
a nerd before?

26:31.314 --> 26:33.580
Get ready to apologize.

26:33.582 --> 26:37.650
(heroic music playing)

26:55.869 --> 26:57.935
(squeaks, clanks, air hisses)

27:00.272 --> 27:01.804
(beeping steadily)

27:15.319 --> 27:17.886
Doing well.

27:17.888 --> 27:20.288
Heart rates are normal but...

27:20.290 --> 27:23.291
you only have 12 minutes to do
a job that should take 12 hours,

27:23.293 --> 27:25.326
so be very careful,
but hurry the hell up.

27:26.429 --> 27:28.996
Don't so much as
breathe on it.

27:33.535 --> 27:35.034
(grunts, gasps)

27:39.306 --> 27:40.638
(gasping)

27:44.410 --> 27:47.444
(quiet blipping,
electronic chiming)

27:54.886 --> 27:56.952
HAPPY:
Adding butane now.

28:03.560 --> 28:05.560
Happy, drill at
that precise angle.

28:05.562 --> 28:07.428
Any variation will
increase friction.

28:07.430 --> 28:10.030
Creating a blast so intense it
would rip off your space suits,

28:10.032 --> 28:12.565
and you'd be dead before
you made it to the door.

28:32.420 --> 28:33.652
Nice steady hand, Happy.

28:33.654 --> 28:34.886
TOBY: Oh, no high
fives yet, guys.

28:34.888 --> 28:38.456
Lots to do; only six minutes
left to do it.

28:38.458 --> 28:40.124
WALTER:
Okay, Sly, you're up.

28:40.126 --> 28:42.493
(panting anxiously)

28:43.629 --> 28:45.895
O... kay.

28:45.897 --> 28:49.031
Now, angle the mirror
at precisely 78 degrees,

28:49.033 --> 28:51.366
to reflect the laser
back to the cube

28:51.368 --> 28:53.801
and reduce
the quantum's power.

28:53.803 --> 28:55.769
(panting):
Uh... uh...

28:55.771 --> 28:57.103
Easy, big fella.

28:57.105 --> 28:58.771
Your adrenaline and
cortisol are spiking.

28:58.773 --> 29:00.038
Just take a breath.

29:00.040 --> 29:01.039
You're doing great.

29:01.041 --> 29:03.041
He is not doing great.

29:03.043 --> 29:05.376
His vitals are all
over the place.

29:05.378 --> 29:07.011
His core temperature
goes up,

29:07.012 --> 29:08.645
it affects the overall temp
in that room even by a fraction,

29:08.647 --> 29:10.647
the quantum fails
and we blow up.

29:10.649 --> 29:13.650
Not to mention if he bounces
that laser around, we blow up.

29:13.652 --> 29:14.917
There's lots of ways to blow up.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.518
(anxious breathing)

29:19.154 --> 29:20.486
(rumbling)

29:20.488 --> 29:22.120
It's an earthquake!

29:22.122 --> 29:23.455
WALTER:
Hold it steady, Sly.

29:23.456 --> 29:24.789
If that foil falls, we can't
pick it back up again.

29:24.791 --> 29:26.957
TOBY: The laser shakes
out of position,

29:26.959 --> 29:28.058
this whole place is a fireball.

29:28.060 --> 29:29.726
Okay, it's not a quake, it's...

29:29.728 --> 29:33.730
I feel like... it's a frequency
at about 41.2 hertz.

29:33.732 --> 29:35.531
It's a damn bass amp.

29:35.533 --> 29:37.533
And it's coming
from above us.

29:37.535 --> 29:38.600
(muffled bass line thumping)

29:38.602 --> 29:39.667
I'm on it!

29:43.105 --> 29:45.839
(dance music throbbing)

29:45.841 --> 29:48.508
TOBY: Two minutes to go, Cabe,
what do you got?

29:48.510 --> 29:50.076
A major problem.

29:50.078 --> 29:52.745
(music pulsates)

29:57.951 --> 29:59.617
(record scratches, music stops)

29:59.619 --> 30:02.152
All right, the show's over!
Everybody back to their dorms!

30:02.154 --> 30:03.720
Suck it, old man!

30:03.722 --> 30:06.189
Undercover DEA.

30:06.191 --> 30:10.426
I want to see the contents
of your knapsacks right now.

30:10.428 --> 30:13.095
MAN: Let's go! Go!
(students clamoring)

30:13.097 --> 30:14.996
Take that, ya punks.

30:14.998 --> 30:16.497
Threat cleared.

30:16.499 --> 30:18.131
Go, Sylvester.

30:18.133 --> 30:19.499
TOBY: Sly, your heart rate
is increasing,

30:19.501 --> 30:20.984
increasing the temp
in that suit,

30:20.985 --> 30:22.468
which is increasing
the temp in the room.

30:22.470 --> 30:24.136
I can't help it, I'm terrified.

30:24.138 --> 30:26.438
Plus I drank a Double Dr. Shaz
before we left the apartment,

30:26.440 --> 30:27.472
and I really have to pee.

30:27.474 --> 30:29.207
(blipping)

30:29.209 --> 30:30.775
One-tenth of a degree,
and we're all toast.

30:30.777 --> 30:32.576
HAPPY: Time check?
TOBY: 70 seconds.

30:32.578 --> 30:34.744
We have to do something
to calm him now.

30:34.746 --> 30:36.512
Sylvester, it's Paige,
listen to me, pal.

30:36.514 --> 30:38.013
Paige, if you're going
to tell me

30:38.015 --> 30:41.082
to imagine a calm, safe place,
now is not the time.

30:41.084 --> 30:42.817
I wouldn't do that.

30:42.819 --> 30:45.786
I want you to imagine
a calm, safe person.

30:45.788 --> 30:48.121
Who made you feel calm
and safe, Sylvester?

30:48.123 --> 30:50.156
Megan.

30:50.158 --> 30:51.524
That's right.

30:51.526 --> 30:53.025
She believed in you, didn't she?

30:53.027 --> 30:54.092
In all of us?

30:54.094 --> 30:55.960
Not the time
to discuss my sister.

30:55.962 --> 30:58.562
You never want to discuss her,
and this is not about you.

30:58.564 --> 31:00.096
Zip it, Walt, it's working.

31:02.934 --> 31:04.934
Think of how proud she would be
of you right now.

31:04.936 --> 31:06.902
Your confidence, your bravery.

31:06.904 --> 31:09.905
The strength she gave you.

31:09.907 --> 31:11.640
Be strong for her.

31:11.642 --> 31:13.174
Know she's with you now.

31:17.946 --> 31:20.212
(electronic whirring)

31:20.214 --> 31:21.546
TOBY: 15 seconds!

31:22.815 --> 31:24.932
The quantum's slowing.

31:24.933 --> 31:27.050
Now we just need to plug in
the drive and upload the code.

31:28.019 --> 31:29.651
TOBY:
Five seconds, Walt.

31:29.653 --> 31:34.488
Eight, seven, six!

31:34.490 --> 31:37.858
Five... four...

31:37.860 --> 31:40.727
three... two...

31:40.729 --> 31:42.495
(quiet click, rapid blipping)

31:42.497 --> 31:43.662
(electronic chiming)

31:43.664 --> 31:45.063
TOBY:
Ransomware is down.

31:45.065 --> 31:46.497
Federal Reserve is safe!

31:46.499 --> 31:48.499
We did it. We did it, we did it.

31:49.969 --> 31:51.668
Great work, team!

31:51.670 --> 31:53.569
TOBY: Now you can get out
of that suit and pee, buddy.

31:53.571 --> 31:56.505
Actually, I don't
have to anymore.

31:56.507 --> 31:57.772
Ew.

31:57.774 --> 32:00.241
Paige, I'm sorry
I snapped at you.

32:00.243 --> 32:01.976
That was great work with Sly.

32:01.978 --> 32:04.812
Thanks, but we've got a problem.

32:06.115 --> 32:08.248
You stopped my ransomware.

32:08.250 --> 32:09.782
But I still want my money.

32:09.784 --> 32:11.884
Or your friend dies.

32:11.886 --> 32:15.554
Bring the bitcoin wallet
to the founder's fountain.

32:15.556 --> 32:18.290
You give me the money,
I give you your friend.

32:19.559 --> 32:23.527
Now... where the hell
are those kids?

32:23.529 --> 32:27.230
They hit Happy after they got
back from the shed and got away.

32:27.232 --> 32:29.265
I don't believe you.

32:29.267 --> 32:31.134
You think I'd lie
about some spoiled kids?

32:31.135 --> 32:33.002
If you don't believe me,
search the apartment.

32:44.548 --> 32:47.048
The founder's fountain
in 20 minutes.

32:47.050 --> 32:50.317
You try anything
and she's dead.

32:55.056 --> 32:56.622
How did Ryder
even find Paige?

32:56.624 --> 32:57.690
Ryder must've
asked the professor

32:57.691 --> 32:58.757
for Dorie's laptop,
under the guise

32:58.759 --> 33:00.291
of checking her code,

33:00.293 --> 33:02.760
and then slipped GPS software
into her hard drive.

33:02.762 --> 33:04.245
TOBY: Who cares
how he found her?

33:04.246 --> 33:05.729
He has her. And even if
we give him the money,

33:05.731 --> 33:07.447
he'd still keep Paige
with him as insurance.

33:07.448 --> 33:09.164
Strategically placing that
ransom drop by the fountain?

33:09.167 --> 33:10.699
That was brilliant.

33:10.701 --> 33:12.701
It's circular, so he has
a good shot at seeing us

33:12.703 --> 33:14.669
come from any angle.
A sneak attack

33:14.671 --> 33:15.870
without knowing
his exact location?

33:15.872 --> 33:17.071
That would be nearly impossible

33:17.073 --> 33:18.172
without threatening
Paige's life.

33:18.174 --> 33:19.706
Exact location, that's it.

33:19.708 --> 33:21.340
But we got to hurry.
Come on!

33:23.711 --> 33:25.277
Your friends better hurry.

33:25.279 --> 33:27.712
One second late, and you
and Professor Cooley

33:27.714 --> 33:30.013
are gonna be spending
a<i> lot</i> of time together.

33:32.117 --> 33:34.951
Hey! Evening, folks!

33:34.953 --> 33:36.820
Whoa, wh-what happened
to your face?

33:36.821 --> 33:38.688
Nothing, just fell
down some stairs.

33:38.690 --> 33:40.289
Oh, okay, well, hey, if you're
heading to the concert,

33:40.291 --> 33:41.923
it got busted up.

33:41.925 --> 33:44.275
Not here for music.

33:44.276 --> 33:46.626
Me and the Mrs. are just taking
a walk around our alma mater.

33:46.629 --> 33:47.728
Oh, well!

33:47.730 --> 33:49.930
How nice!

33:49.932 --> 33:51.231
You know, I always wonder
which young couples around here

33:51.233 --> 33:52.732
are gonna make it
to the long haul.

33:52.734 --> 33:54.900
Actually, pal,
today's our anniversary,

33:54.902 --> 33:57.936
so if you'd be so kind,
a little privacy would be nice?

33:57.938 --> 33:59.938
Anniversary, that's,
uh, that's fantastic!

33:59.940 --> 34:02.707
Hey, uh, let me get a picture
of you-- No, thank you.

34:02.709 --> 34:04.642
I insist!
I'll-I'll e-mail you the shot.

34:04.644 --> 34:07.044
All right,
just bear with me here.

34:07.046 --> 34:09.913
They're at the southwest
side of the fountain.

34:09.915 --> 34:11.681
If you come in on his left,
he'll never see you.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.749
Copy that.

34:15.853 --> 34:19.855
One, two, three, cheese!

34:19.857 --> 34:20.922
(grunting)

34:23.793 --> 34:25.159
(grunts in pain)

34:26.896 --> 34:30.130
Nice job, Griggs.

34:30.132 --> 34:33.833
Slap the cuffs on him.

34:33.835 --> 34:35.867
This is your collar.

34:39.339 --> 34:41.072
This one?
Yeah.

34:41.074 --> 34:42.706
Put my knee right here?

34:42.708 --> 34:46.076
You messed... you messed with
the wrong guys, buddy.

34:46.078 --> 34:48.211
(laughing)

34:48.213 --> 34:50.112
(indistinct radio communication)

34:50.114 --> 34:52.114
All right, the Federal Reserve
system's still running fine,

34:52.116 --> 34:54.249
so we don't have to worry about
living in a<i> Mad Max</i> sequel.

34:54.251 --> 34:56.384
Albert and Dorrie
will be getting their degree

34:56.386 --> 34:59.854
from a state institution, just
not the kind they planned on.

34:59.856 --> 35:02.423
Well, it looks our time
here at college is up.

35:02.425 --> 35:04.825
Oh, my God, no Hacky Sack,
no naked fountain run,

35:04.827 --> 35:06.226
and I missed the winter dance.

35:06.228 --> 35:07.393
College still sucks.

35:07.395 --> 35:08.994
Well, who cares?

35:08.996 --> 35:10.328
So what, college
wasn't great for us.

35:10.330 --> 35:11.862
I bet those guys

35:11.864 --> 35:13.230
who dumped all those
jock straps on my head--

35:13.232 --> 35:14.297
They did what now?

35:14.299 --> 35:16.065
I bet those guys, in ten years,

35:16.067 --> 35:18.300
won't even be in a fraternity
as good as the one I'm in.

35:19.202 --> 35:20.901
Scorpion House.

35:20.903 --> 35:22.235
Oh, that's sweet, Sylvester.

35:22.237 --> 35:23.302
Yeah, nice speech.

35:23.304 --> 35:24.736
I still wanted to
go to a dance.

35:24.738 --> 35:26.003
Oh, come on, mopey.

35:26.005 --> 35:27.137
I'll give you a lift.

35:27.139 --> 35:28.738
You want to come ride with me?

35:28.740 --> 35:29.972
Sure.

35:29.974 --> 35:32.040
CABE:
I'll give Sly a ride home.

35:32.042 --> 35:33.908
Great work, Scorpion House!

35:36.078 --> 35:37.710
If you asked me
when I was in college

35:37.712 --> 35:39.878
if I'd be working with people
like Scorpion one day,

35:39.880 --> 35:41.679
I never would've imagined it.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.881
Well, I'd hope you'd
imagine for something better.

35:43.883 --> 35:44.948
(both chuckle)

35:44.950 --> 35:47.283
Walter, you just made a joke.

35:47.285 --> 35:49.118
More of that in
the future, please.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.820
Oh, noted--
I will work on humor.

35:51.822 --> 35:54.856
Well, if it isn't our
brilliant acting teacher.

35:54.858 --> 35:56.424
So sorry to see you go.

35:56.426 --> 35:58.859
Those who can't, teach.

35:58.861 --> 36:01.127
I'm not sure I agree
with that theory.

36:01.129 --> 36:02.828
Do you mind if I test it?

36:02.830 --> 36:05.096
Thank you.

36:06.232 --> 36:08.232
(clears throat)

36:12.971 --> 36:14.303
Oh, dear Juliet.

36:14.305 --> 36:18.206
Why art thou yet so fair?

36:18.208 --> 36:20.308
Shall I believe

36:20.310 --> 36:22.476
that unsubstantial death

36:22.478 --> 36:25.879
is amorous,

36:25.881 --> 36:30.983
and that the lean,
abhorred monster

36:30.985 --> 36:32.851
keeps thee here,

36:32.853 --> 36:34.886
in dark,

36:34.888 --> 36:37.120
to be his paramour?

36:39.324 --> 36:41.824
For fear of that,

36:41.826 --> 36:45.727
I will stay with thee;

36:45.729 --> 36:47.829
And never...

36:47.831 --> 36:50.865
from this palace of din

36:50.867 --> 36:53.434
might depart

36:53.436 --> 36:56.370
again.

37:01.910 --> 37:04.043
I have no idea why you
find this so difficult.

37:04.045 --> 37:06.812
Excuse me.

37:06.814 --> 37:09.047
Walter O'Brien!

37:09.049 --> 37:10.748
Uh-huh.
That was amazing.

37:10.750 --> 37:13.283
The emotion you just
demonstrated back there?

37:13.285 --> 37:15.051
Well, I was acting.
I was faking it.

37:15.053 --> 37:17.219
Then, why not fake
it all the time?

37:17.221 --> 37:18.771
Why do you need
me on the team?

37:18.772 --> 37:20.322
Okay, so I watched
Shakespeare videos

37:20.324 --> 37:22.791
prior to leaving
the garage,

37:22.793 --> 37:24.826
uh, to pass as a drama teacher.
Uh-huh.

37:24.828 --> 37:26.828
But I don't have
enough time, uh,

37:26.830 --> 37:28.930
to study all the scenarios
in my life,

37:28.932 --> 37:31.532
hence, you being here.

37:31.534 --> 37:33.166
You're my Cliff Notes.
No, no.

37:33.168 --> 37:34.967
You just did a scene
about pain and loss,

37:34.969 --> 37:36.301
and it was real.

37:36.303 --> 37:37.835
Pain and loss, oh, my God--

37:37.837 --> 37:39.002
I-I forgot Ray's experiment.

37:39.004 --> 37:40.203
We gotta go!

37:41.206 --> 37:42.538
The worst part about tonight

37:42.540 --> 37:45.007
is Wimpy Jerkhead
was right about me.

37:45.009 --> 37:47.876
I just want to go home.

37:49.546 --> 37:50.811
Wait there.

37:50.813 --> 37:51.878

38:55.395 --> 38:57.128
The alarm went off,

38:57.130 --> 39:00.597
so I opened up
the curtains and...

39:03.068 --> 39:06.035
Why is Tuggle's
oxygen tank in here?

39:07.271 --> 39:09.304
WALTER: I was running
a slow feed of air through it.

39:09.306 --> 39:12.840
I had a theory that maybe
it was defective,

39:12.842 --> 39:14.908
and your partner's
death wasn't your fault.

39:18.113 --> 39:19.946
Why would you do that?

39:19.948 --> 39:21.080
'Cause I was worried about you.

39:21.082 --> 39:24.983
How long you been
sitting here?

39:24.985 --> 39:27.352
Three minutes.

39:27.354 --> 39:29.587
Maybe 30...

39:33.259 --> 39:35.992
So, what would happen
if it<i> was</i> defective?

39:38.963 --> 39:40.228
(clears throat)

39:40.230 --> 39:42.997
(clears throat)

39:42.999 --> 39:46.233
Bubble trails would form
in that gelatinous mixture.

39:46.235 --> 39:48.468
RAY:
Hmm.

39:48.470 --> 39:50.903
No bubbles.

40:00.480 --> 40:02.079
Ray?

40:02.081 --> 40:05.015
Look.

40:15.060 --> 40:16.259
Is that...?

40:16.261 --> 40:18.327
That is what I was
hoping for.

40:18.329 --> 40:21.129
So it isn't my fault Danny died?

40:21.131 --> 40:22.930
Well, science says it's not.

40:25.601 --> 40:27.534
(quiet laugh)

40:27.536 --> 40:30.370
I never thought I'd have
another friend like Danny.

40:39.514 --> 40:41.914
(quiet laugh)

40:41.916 --> 40:43.949
You know, I've, uh,

40:43.951 --> 40:48.253
been hiding out in that Gremlin
for, like, ten years now...

40:48.255 --> 40:52.590
from something, turns out,
I didn't even do.

40:52.592 --> 40:56.060
So I think it's time that I go
and say hi to the world again.

40:56.062 --> 40:57.394
You know what I mean?

40:57.396 --> 41:00.563
Hey, you can't keep
Ray all to yourself.

41:00.565 --> 41:02.131
You're leaving us?

41:02.133 --> 41:03.699
Don't worry about it, brother.

41:03.701 --> 41:04.966
I'm like a cold sore.

41:04.968 --> 41:06.467
You never know
when I'll be back.

41:09.972 --> 41:12.038
Oh, oh...

41:12.040 --> 41:13.639
(whispering):
You know how he feels about you.

41:13.641 --> 41:16.208
You need to go to him.

41:16.210 --> 41:18.476
He's not able
to do it on his own.

41:19.612 --> 41:22.412
I am really gonna miss you, Pam.

41:22.414 --> 41:24.080
(chuckles)

41:24.082 --> 41:26.115
Tell the fellas I said, uh...

41:26.117 --> 41:28.016
A-Ray-Vederci!

41:34.990 --> 41:36.956
(door opens, shuts)

41:36.958 --> 41:38.390
I was just getting used
to that weirdo.

41:38.392 --> 41:40.959
You hugged him back.

41:40.961 --> 41:42.427
You weren't faking it there.

41:44.063 --> 41:45.829
Huh.

41:45.830 --> 41:47.596
Uh, well, I got to go pick up
Ralph from the sitter.

41:47.599 --> 41:49.098
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.333
Oh, and I-I promise to
get the time capsule

41:51.335 --> 41:53.034
out of here by Friday.

41:53.036 --> 41:55.002
Oh, yeah, the time capsule.

41:55.004 --> 41:57.704
I know you think it's
cheap sentimentality,

41:57.706 --> 41:59.505
but I think

41:59.507 --> 42:02.241
it's where you
put things that matter.

42:02.243 --> 42:06.211
I know there are things that
matter to you, Walter O'Brien.
