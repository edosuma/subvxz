WEBVTT

00:11.640 --> 00:14.920
Tonight, we save the entire world.

00:14.920 --> 00:18.040
We test a fat spaniel from Jaguar.

00:18.040 --> 00:21.400
And we annoy France's
second-best racing driver.

00:26.040 --> 00:29.040
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

00:29.040 --> 00:30.320
Thank you!

00:30.320 --> 00:32.119
Hello, hello, everybody.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.480
Hello and welcome.

00:34.480 --> 00:35.640
Now.

00:37.120 --> 00:44.440
All keen drivers will tell you that
front-wheel drive modern cars are
for the weak.

00:44.440 --> 00:49.440
And that if you're at all serious
about your driving, you have to have
a car with rear wheel drive.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.640
And we agree with them,
even James May.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.520
But our producers disagree.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.360
They think we're talking claptrap.

00:55.360 --> 00:59.240
So, to try and prove their point,
they gave each of us £1,500,

00:59.240 --> 01:02.000
told us to buy a
rear-wheel drive car with it,

01:02.000 --> 01:03.280
and then go to Calais,

01:03.280 --> 01:06.320
where we would be given
a number of stab wounds.

01:06.320 --> 01:09.720
No, not stab wounds...hats.

01:09.720 --> 01:10.920
No, what's the word?

01:10.920 --> 01:12.760
CALL FROM THE CROWD
Sausages! Not sausages!

01:12.760 --> 01:15.320
Challenges! Yes, that!

01:23.760 --> 01:25.840
Mmm, Calais.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.480
Beautiful.

01:30.480 --> 01:36.880
But it has been enlivened
this morning by the arrival
of this magnificent Porsche 944.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.560
And this is the S2 model,
the last and the best.

01:39.560 --> 01:42.840
Three litre engine, at the front,
rear wheel drive,

01:42.840 --> 01:45.000
and the gear box is at
the back as well.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.360
Now, that does mean the, um...

01:47.360 --> 01:49.160
..the boot floor is a bit shallow.

01:49.160 --> 01:54.240
But really, that's a small
price to pay, frankly,

01:54.240 --> 01:57.360
for engineering balance,
engineering perfection.

01:57.360 --> 02:01.760
It is remarkable that you can buy a
car as good as this,

02:01.760 --> 02:03.240
for £1,500.

02:04.800 --> 02:12.240
And equally remarkable that someone
should spend £1,500 on what can only
be described as a Datsun.

02:12.240 --> 02:15.200
A-ha! That's utterly hideous.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.360
It is. Now, let me
just talk you through.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.920
Nissan 300 ZX.

02:18.920 --> 02:24.240
Headlines, technical stuff.
Three litre V6,
four-wheel steer, twin turbo.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.600
I bet you Paul Raymond
had a Nissan 300 ZX.

02:26.600 --> 02:29.600
It's a pornographer's car, isn't it?
It is a pornographer's car.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.720
And then, the 1980s arrived.

02:31.720 --> 02:35.000
MUSIC: Theme to "Minder"

02:36.520 --> 02:37.560
Oh, Lord!

02:37.560 --> 02:40.360
We're on the set of Minder!
Terry McCann is here!

02:40.360 --> 02:42.040
All right, Tel?

02:42.040 --> 02:44.800
I wanna see claret on the pavement!

02:44.800 --> 02:49.240
The Capri 2.8 injection. The last
hurrah of the common man's coupe.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.360
I love these things. It's fantastic.
It's terrible.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.160
Seriously? It's hateful.

02:53.160 --> 03:00.440
All I would say is,
BMW 635, 323, 325,
I saw all of these for £1,500.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.640
Yeah, I know.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.440
But didn't you always want a Capri?

03:03.440 --> 03:09.960
Yes, but the producers aren't going
to say, "The winner is the one who
always wanted their car most."

03:09.960 --> 03:14.600
'Hammond and I then
discovered an interesting
feature on Jeremy's Porsche.'

03:14.600 --> 03:16.720
RICHARD AND JAMES: One, two, three...

03:16.720 --> 03:20.480
Yay! Oh, sorry! Did I hit you?

03:20.480 --> 03:22.160
You actually hit him in the plums!

03:22.160 --> 03:24.000
He does that, he
actually goes for them.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.400
When I was mended, we were
given a challenge.

03:27.400 --> 03:34.520
Right. You will now drive your
£1,500 rear-wheel drive cars
to a racetrack! Yes!

03:36.520 --> 03:41.880
It's called Circuit de Lac... Circuit
de something or other. The only
drawback is, it's 500 miles away.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.960
A Nissan. 500 miles, that's
just...I'm there.

03:44.960 --> 03:48.840
I'm not entirely confident about
that, if I'm being brutally honest.

03:52.520 --> 03:56.480
Our convoy hit the autoroute
for the long drive south.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.920
This car has done 201,000 miles.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.400
That's very nearly
Earth to the moon.

04:06.400 --> 04:12.120
And it feels...like it's done
201,000 miles.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.440
My window switches have come out,

04:16.440 --> 04:20.440
my boot release has come out,
sunroof is broken,
rear wiper is broken.

04:21.680 --> 04:27.320
There were, however, no quality
issues at all in Paul Raymond's car.

04:27.320 --> 04:33.480
So it's done an indicated 103,000
miles. And do you know what?
It feels as tight as a drum.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.320
Everything is
electric and everything works.

04:35.320 --> 04:40.920
Air-con, cruise control,
controls on the steering wheel.
Nothing had that back then!

04:44.400 --> 04:51.280
54.9 miles into our 500-mile
odyssey, and some of the
gauges have starting working.

04:54.480 --> 04:57.400
Soon, the producers told us
to pull in at a rest area,

04:57.400 --> 04:59.880
where, weirdly, we were given
another challenge.

04:59.880 --> 05:02.680
We're going to a racetrack,
we know that.

05:02.680 --> 05:05.440
Should one of your cars not make it
to the destination...

05:05.440 --> 05:07.160
That'll be you.

05:07.160 --> 05:11.960
..producers have provided a back-up
car that also has rear-wheel drive.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.320
That'll be all right, then. 
That's very generous.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.200
That's... I have wondered.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.080
It's not that, is it?

05:18.080 --> 05:19.720
'It was.

05:19.720 --> 05:23.800
'And for us,
Morris Marinas spell trouble.'

05:23.800 --> 05:28.400
I should explain, viewers, we've had
a few run-ins with the Morris Marina
Owners Club over the years.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.480
We keep breaking them.

05:29.480 --> 05:32.880
Not out fault. The last one
really wasn't our fault,
a piano just fell on it.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.200
It rains pianos at our track.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.800
So, is that thing gonna follow us in
the usual... It is, isn't it?

05:37.800 --> 05:41.520
It did follow us, waiting to pounce.

05:41.520 --> 05:48.040
But, for hour after hour, our three
cars - even the Capri - ran without
a single problem.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.360
What we should have said at the
start of the programme is,

05:50.360 --> 05:57.920
"Tonight, three middle-aged men
drive reliable cars across France
without incident."

06:00.840 --> 06:04.360
Of course, as night fell,
our luck ran out.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.160
Are you saying that the
rear lights don't work?

06:08.160 --> 06:10.120
Well, I'm not blinded by it. Look.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.080
Only that one's not working. When
you're driving there's nothing.

06:13.080 --> 06:16.680
'Normally, this would put the
world's least practical man
in the Marina.'

06:16.680 --> 06:22.000
'But, for the first time in
his life, he decided to
try and fix something.'

06:22.000 --> 06:26.120
If I mend this, you lot are going to
have to stand back in amazement.

06:26.120 --> 06:30.240
The thing is, he's actually,
genuinely changed a bulb.
He's done it.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.960
I mended something!

06:31.960 --> 06:34.840
I mended it! You changed a bulb.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.400
Well, it's never happened before.

06:38.320 --> 06:41.400
This opened the floodgates.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.240
It's like losing your virginity.

06:43.240 --> 06:49.000
There's a sense that I've unlocked
a treasure chest of possibilities.
I want to mend lots of things, now.

06:50.160 --> 06:54.360
'That night, at the hotel,
"Jez'll Fix It" went berserk.'

06:54.360 --> 06:56.720
Here we go.

06:58.560 --> 07:02.360
Look at that! My boot release switch
is now back in.

07:02.360 --> 07:05.600
I would never have attempted this
before, but now I can.

07:09.040 --> 07:12.240
Well, it gives us some time on our
own, which is nice.

07:14.320 --> 07:21.560
Hang on, where was it? Ha-ha!
Electric window switches
are now back in.

07:21.560 --> 07:25.800
Oh, no, wait a minute. The sun-roof.
I could just fix that, couldn't I?

07:28.520 --> 07:34.000
The next morning, my show-room
fresh Porsche led our little convoy
on to the race track.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.480
It's not a bad looking track. 
It looks great.

07:37.480 --> 07:39.840
Bit nippy. I look forward to giving
it a... Oh, here we go.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.760
"You are in France." Yes.

07:41.760 --> 07:45.440
"The country that practically
invented front-wheel drive,
and have stuck with it."

07:45.440 --> 07:46.920
Yeah, they have.

07:46.920 --> 07:51.400
"And so, the Stig will now set a lap
time in a very French and very
front-wheel drive Renault Twingo 133.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.880
I thought France
made the Stig violent. 
Evidently not, he looks calm.

07:56.880 --> 08:01.640
All you have to do is beat his time.
You get one point for every second
you are faster than him,

08:01.640 --> 08:04.000
a point lost for every
second you are slower.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.480
How can a Porsche 944 S2 be slower
than a Renault Twingo?

08:08.480 --> 08:13.120
I've got a three litre, twin turbo
V6. I know, Stig's good... 
Why are you looking like that?

08:13.120 --> 08:15.240
I've driven one of those,
they're really fast.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.280
It's a shopping car. Relax!

08:20.120 --> 08:21.160
Go!

08:26.640 --> 08:29.400
He'll have torque steer,
he'll have under-steer.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.480
We're gonna have the tail
drifting out nicely. 
Elegant, sweeping drift.

08:34.480 --> 08:39.240
'Despite the front drive Renault,
the Stig was very quick.'

08:40.480 --> 08:41.520
Finish.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.960
1:32:31.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.880
Who's going first? Baggy not me. 
Baggy not me. Baggy not me.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.240
That's too late. Aww!

08:53.120 --> 08:54.160
Go!

08:54.160 --> 08:58.760
Was that the crummiest start you've
ever seen from a human being? 
It wasn't good.

08:58.760 --> 09:03.040
There is one quite important thing,
I have no idea of the way
around this circuit. 

09:03.040 --> 09:08.400
It's the fast and the furious, this.
Very furious, I should imagine,
knowing Hammond.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.880
Oh, for God's sake,
where's the BLEEP apex?

09:12.880 --> 09:15.920
'Soon, though, I was in the groove.'

09:15.920 --> 09:19.720
Oh, you can see already,
she's drifting round. Yes!

09:19.720 --> 09:22.160
'And then, soon,
I was out of it again.'

09:26.560 --> 09:28.320
Oh, he'll be
clenching in there, now!

09:30.560 --> 09:31.640
I meant that!

09:32.360 --> 09:34.880
'With Hammond out, it was my turn.'

09:37.080 --> 09:39.400
That didn't go as well as I'd hoped.

09:40.920 --> 09:46.320
'Soon, though, I was revelling in
the 944's rear-drive balance.'

09:46.320 --> 09:50.600
Here we go, you see? Front wheels do
the steering, I then plant the
power at the back.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.880
Oooh! Oops...

09:54.880 --> 10:00.960
You're just feeling
the perfect weight. It's all
just absolutely magnificent.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.080
I may have missed the apex
quite a lot there, but...

10:10.440 --> 10:13.040
Here we go. Come on, Porsche!

10:14.040 --> 10:15.760
Confident.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.240
RICHARD CLEARS HIS THROAT

10:19.200 --> 10:21.760
Now, the Stig, 1:32. Yeah.

10:21.760 --> 10:24.040
Jeremy Clarkson. One thirty...

10:24.040 --> 10:27.240
Yeah, I made a bit of a mess of it,
Yeah.

10:27.240 --> 10:30.200
But it's OK! Because everything now
hangs on James!

10:30.200 --> 10:35.680
How can the world of
rear-wheel drive now hang... 
On James May in an old Capri?

10:37.480 --> 10:40.520
I want you to win this for the
prog-rock generation.

10:40.520 --> 10:44.400
So I should think King Crimson,
Pink Floyd... Yeah. Genesis.

10:44.400 --> 10:51.400
Unfortunately, like prog-rock,
James's lap is gonna last 48 minutes
and make no sense to anyone.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.120
GO!

10:54.120 --> 10:55.240
Here we go.

10:56.720 --> 10:59.840
I don't know if I've ever mentioned
this. James isn't a fast driver.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here

11:11.320 --> 11:14.600
Come on, come on! Come on for the
honour of rear-wheel drive!

11:16.320 --> 11:17.800
That's gotta be good.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.320
1:32 to beat.

11:19.320 --> 11:22.720
1:48. What?

11:22.720 --> 11:24.640
But I was going like hell!

11:24.640 --> 11:27.360
'Following our terrible failure,

11:27.360 --> 11:31.440
'The Stig broke out his portable,
rear-wheel drive drifting car,

11:31.440 --> 11:35.480
'to show the front-wheel drive
generation what they're missing.'

11:42.880 --> 11:45.440
'And because we are
all eight years old,

11:45.440 --> 11:47.440
'we thought we'd have a go.'

11:47.440 --> 11:50.080
'But there was a hitch.'

11:50.080 --> 11:53.040
Hammond. Is there any steam coming
from your car?

11:53.040 --> 11:56.080
None whatsoever, no, no, yours?
There's none coming from mine.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.360
However, there's quite a...

11:57.360 --> 12:01.080
How are you going to be able to
drift when you can't see where
you're going?

12:01.080 --> 12:03.280
It'll blow off when I'm going along.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.760
Have you got any tea bags?

12:04.760 --> 12:09.400
It's harmless. This is what
happens when you push a
car to the ragged edge.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.640
Which you haven't done.

12:10.640 --> 12:14.880
'Sadly, by the time Terry McCann's
kettle had cooled down,

12:14.880 --> 12:18.520
'the producers were ready with their
next challenge.'

12:22.400 --> 12:23.720
What are those things?

12:23.720 --> 12:29.960
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
The middle one is exactly the
same colour as my bike.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.360
That one... Yes, my
Christmas present bike.

12:32.360 --> 12:36.680
That's funny, because
the thing on the right looks
suspiciously like my drum kit.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.160
Well that's what I was thinking,
it looks like my piano.

12:39.160 --> 12:41.880
It can't be, because
we smashed that to bits.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.240
Exactly. But I bought another one.

12:43.240 --> 12:47.000
I don't imagine it's coincidence,
and it's there. This is...

12:47.000 --> 12:52.400
Here we go. "You will
accelerate from nought to
60 miles per hour and then brake.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.720
"All within 200 metres."

12:54.720 --> 12:56.680
I know what they're there for.

12:56.680 --> 13:02.160
"If you fail to pull up, you will
not only lose points, but something
dear to your heart as well."

13:02.160 --> 13:04.320
Pianos are really heavy.

13:04.320 --> 13:08.800
You're gonna crash into
your piano in about a minute.
This is a stupid idea.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.480
Airbag, no.

13:10.480 --> 13:15.160
I'm wearing a crash helmet to protect
me from my own motorcycle coming
through the windscreen.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.000
Traction control, no.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.920
I've really gotta get on
the brakes with this.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.960
Anti-lock brakes. Don't know.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.560
Remember to brake at 60, remember to
brake at 60, you stupid boy.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.120
Yes, it's a good start.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.320
Come on, brake.
Good change into second.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.080
40. No!

13:37.040 --> 13:38.080
Come on, car!

13:39.240 --> 13:42.280
60... 60, now!

13:45.360 --> 13:46.400
Cock!

13:51.200 --> 13:52.720
That didn't look good for James.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.440
Look at your Capri.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.800
Never mind the sodding Capri,
look at that!

13:56.800 --> 14:00.240
I think, this...
You could get these in order...

14:00.240 --> 14:01.920
I'm sorry, mate. I'm really sorry.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.360
You're not sorry!

14:03.360 --> 14:05.880
'Then, for James, things got worse.'

14:07.920 --> 14:09.040
Is this normal?

14:09.040 --> 14:10.440
Of course it's not bloody normal.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.880
Look at it this way -
no more challenges.

14:12.880 --> 14:13.920
Good. Oh.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.440
Apart from that one.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.800
What now?

14:16.800 --> 14:21.880
"So far, real-wheel drive has not
been relevant in any way."

14:21.880 --> 14:23.880
Steady on!

14:23.880 --> 14:28.960
"So you will now drive to
Val Thorens in the Alps, to see if
some use can be found for it there."

14:28.960 --> 14:30.360
What's Val Thorens?

14:30.360 --> 14:32.640
Well, it's a skiing resort.
I've been there.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.480
Is it far?

14:34.480 --> 14:36.400
115 miles.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.480
With bits of piano sticking out
the front. That's a long way.

14:39.480 --> 14:44.040
Don't need that. 
Oh, yeah, good luck to you.
There's nothing wrong with the car.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.360
It's got a dent in it, that's all.
Come on,

14:46.360 --> 14:47.400
Val Thorens.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.960
He just drove over this.

15:00.280 --> 15:03.000
APPLAUSE

15:03.000 --> 15:07.080
That's from back in the days when
Porsche could style cars. 
It was a good looking car.

15:07.080 --> 15:11.360
It was. We'll pick up on that later,

15:11.360 --> 15:14.200
because now we're going
to do the news.

15:14.200 --> 15:18.040
Yes, yes. And the people who
have collaborated with Google
on their Smartphone

15:18.040 --> 15:19.880
have turned their attention to cars. 

15:19.880 --> 15:24.160
They've researched motoring and come
to a conclusion. Their conclusion is
this, and I can quote -

15:24.160 --> 15:28.920
they say, that humans
are not meant to drive.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.040
LAUGHTER

15:30.040 --> 15:34.400
We're not meant to use ovens,
either, or wear shoes,
but that's just ridiculous.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.400
That's the conclusion they've come
to, and they've come up with this!

15:37.400 --> 15:39.760
It's called the Autonomobile.

15:39.760 --> 15:40.800
LAUGHTER

15:40.800 --> 15:42.560
I can tell you like it,
I can tell that.

15:42.560 --> 15:47.240
You'll notice there's no steering
wheel or brakes or any controls at
all for you to operate.

15:47.240 --> 15:50.040
It's the Autonomobile, it does it
itself, you see?

15:50.040 --> 15:54.280
Yes, it's very clever. You get in
it, you tell it where you want to
go, and then it says -

15:54.280 --> 15:56.360
and I'm gonna make sure
I get this right - 

15:56.360 --> 16:02.040
they say you "sit back, enjoy
the view with a nice wine,
cheese and a baguette."

16:02.040 --> 16:03.080
Oh, lovely.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.400
How lovely.

16:04.400 --> 16:08.560
I think this is a brilliant idea. I
genuinely like the idea of sitting
about with a glass of wine,

16:08.560 --> 16:09.840
some cheese, and going home.

16:09.840 --> 16:14.800
However, there is one problem with a
sort of laser-guided, radar-guided,
satellite-guided car.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.360
We know - because it's
statistically proven -

16:17.360 --> 16:20.760
that half of all plane crashes are
caused by pilot error, yes?

16:20.760 --> 16:21.880
Yeah. We also know,

16:21.880 --> 16:24.720
that planes can take off, fly and
land by themselves, yes?

16:24.720 --> 16:25.840
This is a fact.

16:25.840 --> 16:30.400
So, if you remove the pilot
from the plane, you would
half the number of crashes.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.400
Stands to reason.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.160
However, would you get on a plane
that had no pilot?

16:36.160 --> 16:37.200
BOTH: No.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.480
You see? Then that's
the problem with this.

16:39.480 --> 16:45.360
Great idea, but the problem is, you
just happen to know, this has been
invented by a brilliant man.

16:45.360 --> 16:49.760
But, five years down the line,
it's going to be bought
by someone called Keith.

16:49.760 --> 16:54.920
Keith is going to wake up one day
and think he can service it himself.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.240
Yes.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.760
Which means you wont be able to
relax in your Autonomobile.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.720
Because you'll be thinking,

17:00.720 --> 17:03.680
"I know that somebody called Keith,

17:03.680 --> 17:08.240
"reading the Daily Star
and watching EastEnders
is coming the other way."

17:08.240 --> 17:10.280
LAUGHTER

17:10.280 --> 17:13.200
And there's going to be
a horrible accident.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.800
It's all rubbish. What?

17:14.800 --> 17:18.240
Cars that drive
themselves were invented ages
ago. They're called taxis.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.839
LAUGHTER

17:20.839 --> 17:22.560
Right, now, news from India.

17:22.560 --> 17:27.680
There's a company over there, car
company, Tata, they've got a large
car division.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.120
Got a new car out, here it is.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.400
It's the Jaguar XJ.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.440
It's quite striking to look at.

17:34.440 --> 17:38.080
The interior is gorgeous as well. It
looks fabulous, look at that!

17:38.080 --> 17:42.280
It costs £50,000 to £90,000,
depending on the model,

17:42.280 --> 17:47.080
the direct injection V8, two new
diesels, with 271 and I think...

17:47.080 --> 17:49.320
270... 271...

17:49.320 --> 17:51.680
Nobody gives a pig's arse about
all that Diesel stuff.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.800
It's a new XJ, the important
question is, "Is it a proper Jag?"

17:57.800 --> 18:01.440
What you mean is,
is this car slightly caddish?

18:01.440 --> 18:02.480
That's what you mean.

18:02.480 --> 18:03.520
Yes.

18:03.520 --> 18:06.520
Is the person who drives it... Oh,
what's the word, I'm not quite sure

18:06.520 --> 18:12.000
how to sum it up, but they're the
sort of person who'd go away for the
weekend with his wife to a hotel,

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
some romantic place, and spend the
entire night flirting outrageously
with the waitress.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.560
And it's OK because he's got a Jag.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.640
LAUGHTER

18:20.640 --> 18:23.760
You can get away with anything!

18:23.760 --> 18:26.120
"I'm terribly sorry,
I ran over your dog." "Oh!"

18:26.120 --> 18:27.160
"In my Jag."

18:27.160 --> 18:29.160
"Never mind."

18:29.160 --> 18:33.800
Is it fair to say, do you think,
that no Jag driver is ever entirely
trustworthy,

18:33.800 --> 18:36.200
but it's in a really nice,
likeable way?

18:36.200 --> 18:40.760
Because if you went to a prison -
forget the stabbists
and the stranglers,

18:40.760 --> 18:45.680
the ones that are in there for
a bit of tax-dodging -
I bet 80% have got Jags.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.280
You know what I mean, don't you?

18:47.280 --> 18:49.080
Have you got a Jag?

18:49.080 --> 18:50.160
Who here's got a Jag?

18:50.160 --> 18:53.360
You've got a Jag? Look at him!

18:53.360 --> 18:56.560
He goes away with a girl
for the weekend and then goes,

18:56.560 --> 18:58.200
"Awfully sorry."

18:58.200 --> 19:02.560
"Bit of an issue with the wallet." 
"Do you mind, awfully, settling this
while I go warm up the Jag?"

19:02.560 --> 19:04.360
LAUGHTER

19:04.360 --> 19:08.200
The thing is, I think that is
just a brilliant, brilliant
piece of design, because

19:08.200 --> 19:10.800
it's a Jag. But it's kind of modern.

19:10.800 --> 19:17.280
That's an absolutely
fantastic looking car, that.
Can't wait to have a go on in it.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.840
Oh! Guys, guys, guys, guys. I want
to show you this.

19:19.840 --> 19:20.960
It's a speeding ticket,

19:20.960 --> 19:24.440
which was issued in California, OK?

19:24.440 --> 19:28.320
We see here that the car in question
is a Bugatti two-door.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.840
I'm guessing a Veyron.

19:29.840 --> 19:35.920
Speed limit on the road, 65 miles
per hour. Recorded speed, 210.4.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.120
Whoa!

19:37.120 --> 19:41.080
APPLAUSE

19:41.080 --> 19:42.720
Yeah, what about that?

19:44.200 --> 19:46.920
Unbelievable.

19:46.920 --> 19:52.960
If he'd done that in this
country, you'd be put in
prison for 2,000 years. 

19:52.960 --> 19:55.560
Do you want to know what
the fine in California is

19:55.560 --> 19:58.880
for doing 210 miles per hour
on a road with a 65 miles per hour
speed limit?

19:58.880 --> 20:03.320
You get, basically, the maximum fine
a judge can impose is 500. 

20:03.320 --> 20:04.640
For 210 miles per hour.

20:04.640 --> 20:09.240
And if you do it again,
it's just 750.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.760
So, goodbye. We're off. 
Yeah, that's it!

20:11.760 --> 20:15.560
Why aren't we there
doing what we do? I know!

20:15.560 --> 20:18.600
This is the worst country for making
a car programme.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.680
Honestly, I think we should go,
that is civilised behaviour.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.000
Now. Bad news.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.560
It's about this,
the Honda FRV it's called.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.520
It's a six-seater car, it had
three seats in the front,

20:29.520 --> 20:34.880
three in the back. Well, Honda say
it's been such an enormous success,
they're dropping it.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.600
The problem with this car is
with the picture they sent us,

20:38.600 --> 20:41.400
which is when the car
came out a few years ago.

20:41.400 --> 20:45.040
Nobody wants to drive around
with a small girl's severed
head on the dash.

20:45.040 --> 20:49.720
The worst thing about this was that
when it came out, we all got
suckered into it and thought,

20:49.720 --> 20:53.320
"Three in the front, three in
the back, it makes sense,"
but it doesn't.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.120
If you think, I've got two daughters,

20:55.120 --> 20:59.560
so if I have one girl in the
front between me and my wife,
that leaves one girl on her own!

20:59.560 --> 21:02.360
You're just gonna have an argument
every time you go near it!

21:02.360 --> 21:04.680
Exactly. It's not gonna work. 
That's not the worst bit.

21:04.680 --> 21:11.280
It could be worse if you had your
wife in the front, and both
daughters, and you sat in the back.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.720
Oh... But you do see that
occasionally.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.880
The mother in the front and
a bloke in the back.

21:15.880 --> 21:19.040
It's tragic. There's
nothing more pathetic.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.320
It's the most
pitiable sight you can see.

21:21.320 --> 21:25.800
She's effectively saying,
"You've given me the baby,
now get in the back." Yeah.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.320
No.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.480
That concludes the news, OK?

21:41.920 --> 21:46.640
That concludes the news,
and now, if you don't mind,
I want to talk about the BMW M5.

21:46.640 --> 21:50.040
You see, what we have here
are two cars.

21:50.040 --> 21:53.840
One of them is a spacious,
practical four-door saloon.

21:53.840 --> 21:57.120
The other is a blistering,
growling monster.

21:57.120 --> 22:01.840
For 24 years, this has been
the ultimate sports saloon.

22:01.840 --> 22:05.960
But now, there is a new Jag.

22:09.400 --> 22:14.320
The new XFR doesn't look much like
a blistering, growling monster.

22:14.320 --> 22:17.080
There are no bulges in its flex.

22:17.080 --> 22:19.600
There are no scoops.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.320
There's no Cheshire-ishness at all.

22:22.320 --> 22:25.720
It looks like it might
even be a diesel.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.480
It's the same story on the inside.

22:29.480 --> 22:33.720
Sitting in an M5 is like actually
sitting in a laptop.

22:33.720 --> 22:38.280
It couldn't be more geeky, even if
the sat-nav voice was Buffy.

22:38.280 --> 22:43.000
In the Jag, though, all I've got is
a steering wheel and some pedals.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.400
It even has an automatic gearbox.

22:49.440 --> 22:53.760
Don't be fooled by the
plain-Jane simplicity, though.

22:53.760 --> 22:58.200
Because the speed of this thing is
simply unbelievable.

23:03.040 --> 23:08.280
Right. That is nought to 60 in four
and a half seconds, and look at it.

23:08.280 --> 23:10.920
80...90...100...

23:10.920 --> 23:17.400
110...115...it's supposed to be
limited to 155, but, look!

23:17.400 --> 23:21.440
165 and it's still accelerating!

23:21.440 --> 23:25.280
That's unbelievable!

23:25.280 --> 23:28.760
What's it limited by?

23:28.760 --> 23:34.560
"If you don't stick to 155, I shall
jolly well write to the
Daily Telegraph about it."

23:36.480 --> 23:44.360
'The key to this rampant savagery is
an all-new, all-Welsh supercharged
five-litre V8 engine.

23:44.360 --> 23:48.280
'There's no other word.
It's fantastic.

23:48.280 --> 23:56.000
'And there's more good news.
At £60,000, the Jag is
noticeably cheaper than an M5.

23:56.000 --> 24:02.440
'It's also quieter, and
it's way more comfortable.'

24:02.440 --> 24:05.480
It is uncannily comfortable.

24:05.480 --> 24:11.200
It's so soft and so absorbent,
it's like sitting on a fat dog.

24:12.160 --> 24:17.640
You can't really believe it'll
go round a corner at all,
leave alone like this.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.720
I'm doing that wearing brogues!

24:27.720 --> 24:33.360
'To keep it planted,
it has an electronic diff
like you get on a Ferrari.

24:33.360 --> 24:37.040
'And suspension that adjusts itself
hundreds of times a second.'

24:37.040 --> 24:42.680
You can be just inch-perfect,
even when you're driving like
a complete lunatic.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.200
Whoa! Ha-ha!

24:52.040 --> 24:53.480
So easy!

24:59.760 --> 25:04.320
So, this is two cars as well. It's
amazingly comfortable and quiet

25:04.320 --> 25:07.400
when you're not in the mood
for fun and games,

25:07.400 --> 25:10.240
and it's savagely fast when you are.

25:11.720 --> 25:15.680
But, can it really be as
fast as an M5?

25:17.120 --> 25:18.960
Let's find out.

25:21.680 --> 25:24.920
Both cars produce as near as makes
no difference, 500 horse-power.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.520
And both weigh about the same.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.280
There are some differences,
of course.

25:37.880 --> 25:41.560
He can rev to 8,000, I can only rev
to six and a half.

25:42.880 --> 25:49.400
He's got ten cylinders, I've only
got eight. He's got seven speeds in
his gear box, I've only got six.

25:51.720 --> 25:56.000
BUT I have 80 more torques
than him. 80!

25:59.000 --> 26:03.480
I've got so much torque,
I could tear a hole in TIME!

26:08.840 --> 26:11.880
Yes, he's got better brakes,
but coming out of the corner,

26:11.880 --> 26:15.120
I'm gonna unleash my meteorite of
torque, here we go!

26:25.240 --> 26:29.720
This is getting hot, hard and
dangerous now. I need to stay cool.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.920
There's the air-con.

26:48.160 --> 26:51.520
I'm not for a moment
going to suggest that this
is better than an M5.

26:54.440 --> 26:58.560
But it's as good as. And praise
doesn't get higher than that.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.680
Boot full of stolen videos.

27:13.920 --> 27:18.000
So, right, on the track,
the Jag is as good as the BMW.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.560
..Nearly.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.760
On the road?

27:21.760 --> 27:24.040
Honestly, I think on
the road it's better.

27:24.040 --> 27:26.720
Tell you what we'll do now, we'll
put some maths into the mix.

27:26.720 --> 27:29.240
Because we'll find out how fast
it goes around our track,

27:29.240 --> 27:32.280
and that means handing it over
to our tame racing driver.

27:32.280 --> 27:38.880
Some say he has 12 GCSEs,
all in domestic science.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.960
LAUGHTER

27:40.960 --> 27:44.320
And that he's been producing
artificial sperm for years.

27:44.320 --> 27:48.080
Even though we have
repeatedly asked him not to.

27:48.080 --> 27:50.880
All we know is
he's called the Stig.

27:51.760 --> 27:56.560
And he's off!
503 Welsh horsepowers!

27:56.560 --> 27:58.280
Charging him down
to the first corner.

27:58.280 --> 28:02.440
This is still a two-ton car, so
let's see how it battles the laws
of physics here.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.040
Looking nice so far.

28:04.040 --> 28:07.120
And a lovely little slide
on the way out.

28:07.120 --> 28:10.880
BAGPIPE MUSIC PLAYS ON THE RADIO

28:12.280 --> 28:14.840
The sound of bits, there,
being served in a stomach lining.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.520
Chicago.

28:16.520 --> 28:20.160
There goes the tail again,
this thing really is a
leathery drift machine.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.760
As he comes into the Hammerhead.

28:21.760 --> 28:25.280
The Jag's clever diff runs
in open mode when you don't
need limited slip...

28:25.280 --> 28:27.040
That doesn't eliminate under-steer.

28:27.040 --> 28:31.040
Fortunately, Stig does with a boot
full of supercharged goodness!

28:31.040 --> 28:36.520
BAGPIPE MUSIC PLAYS ON THE RADIO

28:36.520 --> 28:41.640
Terrible smell of oats all of a
sudden. There he is through
the follow-through.

28:41.640 --> 28:44.080
Punishing its tires, battling on
well. That was fast.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.800
Here he goes, second to last corner.

28:46.800 --> 28:50.520
More over-steer, and up to Gambon,
wonder what will happen here.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.320
Yep, there goes the tail again.
And across the line!

28:53.320 --> 28:58.400
APPLAUSE

28:58.400 --> 29:00.360
Now...

29:00.360 --> 29:04.840
Here we are, look. BMW, M5.

29:04.840 --> 29:07.560
1:26:2.

29:07.560 --> 29:11.520
Now, I expected the Jag to be a
little bit slower than that.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.080
And it was.

29:13.080 --> 29:16.840
Unfortunately, just half a second in
it. But, look at it this way,

29:16.840 --> 29:23.360
If you have an XFR, "Do you know,
I've lost my wallet!" You never have
to pay for anything.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.560
Now, normally, that would be that.

29:25.560 --> 29:28.000
However, these days, as
I'm sure you know,

29:28.000 --> 29:32.600
the amount of tax you pay on a car
depends on how much carbon dioxide
it produces.

29:32.600 --> 29:39.200
Yeah, and according to official
figures, the XFR produces 292 carbon
dioxides per kilometre.

29:39.200 --> 29:43.000
Which is very impressive,
no other car of its type
gets even close to that.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.400
But, predictably, Jeremy
thought he could do better.

29:49.160 --> 29:55.280
As we know, plants absorb
carbon dioxide, and
then breathe out oxygen.

29:55.280 --> 30:01.760
So why not put plants in the
exhaust system of your car?

30:02.520 --> 30:04.080
Impossible?

30:04.080 --> 30:06.800
Well, Alan Titchmarsh might say so,

30:06.800 --> 30:08.880
but, er, what does HE know?

30:11.200 --> 30:14.160
What we have here is a Range Rover,

30:14.160 --> 30:18.000
which now has the same 5 litre V8
that you get in the Jag.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.880
At the back, we have tubes
which takes the exhaust gases

30:20.880 --> 30:26.040
into this greenhouse, which is full
of plants - tomato plants,
on this occasion.

30:26.040 --> 30:32.840
And that means the tailpipes emit
no greenhouse gases at all.

30:32.840 --> 30:35.800
What you're looking at here,
ladies and gentlemen,

30:35.800 --> 30:38.000
is the future.

30:43.480 --> 30:48.360
It really is impossible to
overemphasise the importance

30:48.360 --> 30:51.480
of what has been achieved here
today.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.800
Look at what I'm driving.

30:53.800 --> 30:57.440
A big, heavy, thirsty
four-wheel drive car,

30:57.440 --> 31:01.520
and the only waste product is
some juicy tomatoes!

31:07.960 --> 31:09.240
GLASS SMASHES

31:09.240 --> 31:13.040
You thought Greenpeace would save
the world, but no!

31:15.240 --> 31:17.680
It's Top Gear! We've done it!

31:25.320 --> 31:27.960
Where's it gone?

31:29.200 --> 31:31.280
APPLAUSE

31:31.280 --> 31:33.400
Why are they applauding?!

31:34.400 --> 31:37.680
Well done(!) I know there was
a bit of glass on the runway.

31:37.680 --> 31:41.280
Yeah, brilliant. Brilliant Top Gear
WOULD have saved the planet,

31:41.280 --> 31:46.080
except you smashed your greenhouse
to bits. I admit, it didn't go
brilliantly. But you also said

31:46.080 --> 31:50.160
that you weren't giving out any
greenhouse emissions at all. Yes.

31:50.160 --> 31:54.480
That's rubbish cos you only had 100
tomato plants. How many tomato
plants do you need

31:54.480 --> 31:56.840
to get rid of the emissions
from a Range Rover?

31:56.840 --> 31:58.960
400,000.
LAUGHTER

31:58.960 --> 32:02.120
Seriously? And we've worked this
out. To accommodate that many,

32:02.120 --> 32:05.160
your greenhouse would have to be
six miles long.

32:05.160 --> 32:08.880
I can tell why you two
aren't astronauts. Eh?

32:08.880 --> 32:12.920
Who here has seen Apollo 13? Yeah?
You know what I'm on about.

32:12.920 --> 32:17.920
That bit when Houston telephones
the astronauts in the spacecraft

32:17.920 --> 32:23.280
because carbon dioxide is building
up and they need to build something
to get rid of it. Remember?

32:23.280 --> 32:27.440
Yes? Good. These two would go,
"We're a bit cold and frightened!"

32:27.440 --> 32:30.800
Whereas I am Commander Jim Lovell.

32:30.800 --> 32:34.480
I didn't give up
after my greenhouse failure.

32:34.480 --> 32:38.640
I came back, rolled up my sleeves
and came up with another idea.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.960
Oh, God!
If you fire up the Jag, right?

32:41.960 --> 32:45.840
ENGINE STARTS
What we've got is a gasometer.

32:45.840 --> 32:49.320
And its prong is up that exhaust.
What it's telling me

32:49.320 --> 32:53.200
is that 15% of the gas

32:53.200 --> 32:55.560
coming out of this exhaust pipe

32:55.560 --> 32:58.480
is carbon dioxide.
Come here and verify that for me.

32:58.480 --> 33:02.320
It's actually 14.5%, yes?
OK, yeah. Yeah.

33:02.320 --> 33:05.320
Right. Take the prong out

33:05.320 --> 33:09.080
because, on this side,
on THIS tailpipe, I've modified it.

33:09.080 --> 33:13.600
Got tubes feeding into
this Apollo 13 homemade filter...

33:13.600 --> 33:18.160
LAUGHTER
..which is full
of lime soda crystals,

33:18.160 --> 33:23.560
which are used to absorb the carbon
dioxide in those huge
Australian mines, OK?

33:23.560 --> 33:26.680
We're gonna pop the prong in the top
because the gas is going down there,

33:26.680 --> 33:29.960
through the crystals, out of there.
Let's have a look

33:29.960 --> 33:33.440
at how much carbon dioxide
THAT'S producing...

33:33.440 --> 33:36.760
It's none. What, nothing?! NONE?!

33:36.760 --> 33:42.000
Absolutely NO carbon dioxide
is coming out of that car.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.120
Wow!
APPLAUSE

33:50.120 --> 33:54.320
Now, I know we have a reputation on
Top Gear for cocking about, OK?

33:54.320 --> 33:56.440
But on this occasion, we aren't.

33:56.440 --> 33:59.480
This is not a Toyota Prius
or a stupid G-Wiz,

33:59.480 --> 34:01.840
it's got a 5 litre, supercharged V8,

34:01.840 --> 34:05.320
and all that's coming
out of this tailpipe

34:05.320 --> 34:07.920
is nitrogen and oxygen, which is...?

34:07.920 --> 34:11.400
Air. Hang on a sec. What?
These little rocks of yours.

34:11.400 --> 34:14.960
Yes. They absorb carbon dioxide?
They absorb it, yes.

34:14.960 --> 34:19.040
So, how far can you go
before they get all clogged up
and can't absorb any more?

34:19.040 --> 34:20.719
On a motorway...

34:20.719 --> 34:23.199
six miles.
LAUGHTER

34:23.199 --> 34:27.320
With something that size. How much
does it cost for a new box of rocks?

34:27.320 --> 34:29.440
£75. Oh, God!

34:29.440 --> 34:32.400
I know. Barnes Wallis had setbacks,

34:32.400 --> 34:37.360
but he persevered, and I'm sure,
if science can make
genetically-modified wheat,

34:37.360 --> 34:40.080
they can make those absorb more.
I really do think

34:40.080 --> 34:42.639
that we're onto something here.

34:42.639 --> 34:45.719
Shall I go and work on it?
Yes, go and work on it

34:45.719 --> 34:50.239
because it is now time to put a
star...in our reasonably priced car.

34:50.239 --> 34:53.760
We're often criticised
by politicians and newspapers

34:53.760 --> 34:56.000
for being sexist on this programme.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.760
Well, tonight we answer those
critics because my guest is a girl.

34:59.760 --> 35:03.760
And a dead fit one!
Ladies and gentlemen, Sienna Miller!

35:03.760 --> 35:06.360
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

35:06.360 --> 35:08.600
Hello!

35:08.600 --> 35:12.360
How are you? I'm good. Have a seat.

35:13.920 --> 35:16.400
I like that - "Yeah!"

35:16.400 --> 35:18.600
This is momentous stuff.

35:18.600 --> 35:21.480
Even as we speak,
James May is out the back

35:21.480 --> 35:24.560
looking up in his dictionary
what "girl" means.

35:24.560 --> 35:30.160
Yes, he is.
Now, you weren't actually born
to be in theatre, you were born...

35:30.160 --> 35:36.160
IN a theatre. Literally? Literally.
Mum went into labour in the
Nutcracker Suite in New York,

35:36.160 --> 35:39.200
and stayed, throughout the labour,
to finish the show.

35:39.200 --> 35:43.200
So you were born in... That makes
you an Americanista. Well, both.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.200
My mum's English, my dad's American,
so I have two passports.

35:46.200 --> 35:49.000
You went to boarding school
in England. I did.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.160
I heard that while you were there...

35:51.160 --> 35:55.400
Oh, God. How can I put this? You
got into trouble for doing things
with a rabbit.

35:55.400 --> 36:00.280
Oh, my sweet Lord! I did not do
anything personally with a rabbit,

36:00.280 --> 36:05.720
I got another rabbit to do something
to another rabbit to get
baby rabbits. And it worked!

36:05.720 --> 36:08.920
They really do do it like rabbits!
Fair enough.

36:08.920 --> 36:13.240
So you went into films, obviously.
Yes. Having been born in theatre.

36:13.240 --> 36:16.480
Most of them, let's be honest, have
been quite brainy, quite Channel 4.

36:16.480 --> 36:21.000
To you, boring - just say it.
No, I liked Layer Cake, that bit...

36:21.000 --> 36:24.440
Oh, God! Yeah. You remember the bit
in Layer Cake?

36:24.440 --> 36:25.520
AUDIENCE: Yes!

36:25.520 --> 36:30.360
That was a long time ago,
it's all gone tits up since then - 
or tits down!

36:30.360 --> 36:33.360
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

36:33.360 --> 36:35.440
I can't believe I just said that!

36:35.440 --> 36:37.600
You see... Oh, God.

36:37.600 --> 36:41.600
You say that, but your new film,
which is called GI... GI Joe.

36:41.600 --> 36:46.200
GI Joe. That's not sort of cerebral
at all. No. Everything blows up.

36:46.200 --> 36:50.000
Lots of guns, leather. It's perfect
for Top Gear. Leather? Yes.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.360
Really?

36:53.400 --> 36:58.080
Normally we don't show clips,
but on this occasion, I think

36:58.080 --> 37:00.280
we can struggle into doing that.
Let's have a look.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.200
We're running out of time! Eject!

37:20.560 --> 37:22.840
This has only just begun.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.640
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

37:36.120 --> 37:41.360
Just one thing. Why did the film
company send us a clip
without you in it?!

37:41.360 --> 37:43.840
I was in it! I had a black wig on!

37:43.840 --> 37:48.640
Let's get this straight. This is GI
Joe, who's the American equivalent
of the Action Man toy. Yeah.

37:48.640 --> 37:54.920
Well, he's not called Joe, Joe
is an elite force of fighter...
world protector people.

37:54.920 --> 37:58.280
But I'm on the bad camp, the Cobra
camp. Oh, you're a baddie? I am.

37:58.280 --> 38:01.400
I understand there's a record set
with it, with cars? We blew up

38:01.400 --> 38:04.880
112 cars, destroyed 112 cars,
which is a record.

38:04.880 --> 38:07.480
The Blues Brothers held it before.
Yeah. So, 112? Yes.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.440
But you're still some way behind us.

38:09.440 --> 38:13.720
Probably quite far behind you!
112 every 20 minutes.
I've added one to that today,

38:13.720 --> 38:16.640
I think, with my lap.
We'll find that out later.

38:16.640 --> 38:20.280
Before that, though, I want to talk
about fashion magazines.

38:20.280 --> 38:25.080
They always talk about the Sienna
look. We should look at what you're
wearing now. It's not very exciting!

38:25.080 --> 38:28.560
I should've brought another T-shirt
for after my lap, it's quite sweaty.

38:28.560 --> 38:33.360
Have you not changed since...? No!
I didn't realise it would be that
scary! It's soaking wet!

38:33.360 --> 38:36.000
Pop it off if you want to.
LAUGHTER

38:36.000 --> 38:38.640
I say the same to the male guests.

38:38.640 --> 38:41.600
I mean, you are a trendsetter.

38:41.600 --> 38:46.160
I suppose the problem is, it does
make you a massive paparazzi target.

38:46.160 --> 38:48.400
But I sued them all, and won!

38:48.400 --> 38:52.800
I was the first to sue and win on
harassment, so now they can't do
anything. I saw two of them

38:52.800 --> 38:56.120
the other day, and I ran. They were
like, "We can't." And I was like...

38:57.120 --> 38:59.560
I flashed them!
It was the best feeling!

38:59.560 --> 39:02.880
That's fantastic!
APPLAUSE

39:02.880 --> 39:04.200
Yeah!

39:04.200 --> 39:09.240
It's true, you really genuinely did
set legal history.

39:09.240 --> 39:11.680
I did! How bad was it for you?

39:11.680 --> 39:16.040
Every day, probably 15 people
following you everywhere.
Did they chase you?

39:16.040 --> 39:19.200
They were being mean. Shouting,
"Slapper." I can handle that,

39:19.200 --> 39:22.800
but kicking the car and trying
to make you scared.
Do they chase you in the car?

39:22.800 --> 39:26.040
Yes, did you ever have car chases?
Yeah, tons. Really? Yeah.

39:26.040 --> 39:29.600
The other night,
James and Richard were leaving here,

39:29.600 --> 39:33.640
and someone was beside them on
the M4, taking pictures of them,

39:33.640 --> 39:39.160
and he drove his Mini into the back
of the car in front.
That was a result!

39:39.160 --> 39:44.240
We need to talk about your driving
test because I'm confused.
You recently took your driving test.

39:44.240 --> 39:47.440
I passed my driving test last week.
Just last week?! Five days ago!

39:47.440 --> 39:50.600
APPLAUSE
Thank you! Five days?!

39:50.600 --> 39:52.840
Five days.

39:55.040 --> 39:59.120
Now, I'm very baffled because
you've been driving for years.

39:59.120 --> 40:02.440
No, I haven't! I found a loophole.

40:02.440 --> 40:06.080
Which is? My father lives
in the US Virgin Islands,

40:06.080 --> 40:09.800
which is a Caribbean island, which
is technically part of America.

40:09.800 --> 40:13.360
So I got a licence there that meant
I could drive in America and England

40:13.360 --> 40:18.400
for a year, as an American.
It was an interesting driving test,
for sure.

40:18.400 --> 40:21.040
I had to drive down the street
and back.

40:21.040 --> 40:25.040
And that's the test?
Window down, he had the reggae on!

40:25.040 --> 40:28.600
That's the test in the Virgin
Islands! Exactly! There's a top tip

40:28.600 --> 40:34.200
for anybody finding it a struggle
to get a driving licence here!
Pop over there! Slip over there.

40:34.200 --> 40:37.200
So, how is your driving record?
Good, bad, indifferent?

40:37.200 --> 40:40.720
Mm, the first time I drove,
I wrote off a car,

40:40.720 --> 40:45.200
so not good. My best friend and her
brother had a little car on a farm
that they lived on,

40:45.200 --> 40:50.200
and I pretended I could drive, and
got in it, and pushed the
accelerator instead of the brakes,

40:50.200 --> 40:53.680
through a concrete bollard...
Ditch, fence, cows out...

40:53.680 --> 40:56.800
stuck. I had to climb out
of the window covered in oil.

40:56.800 --> 41:00.040
And that was your first ever
experience? It was.

41:00.040 --> 41:04.880
Then you drove around the Virgin
Islands, which can't have taken more
than five minutes. No.

41:04.880 --> 41:07.600
Then you took your driving test five
days ago. Yes! And now you're here!

41:07.600 --> 41:11.480
We've never had
a better-qualified person, really,

41:11.480 --> 41:15.200
to do our lap! How was it out there?
Did you enjoy it?

41:15.200 --> 41:18.560
It was pretty scary. I've never
really driven a stick shift.

41:18.560 --> 41:22.560
You deserve credit, genuinely, if
you've never driven a manual car,

41:22.560 --> 41:27.440
and belting round with the Stig.
Yes. Who would like to see
Sienna's lap? Oh, no!

41:27.440 --> 41:30.800
AUDIENCE: Yes!
Let's have a look at this! Oh, God!

41:30.800 --> 41:32.440
TYRES SQUEAL

41:32.440 --> 41:35.280
Is that your first wheel spin start?
Yes.

41:35.280 --> 41:37.240
I'm gonna nail it.

41:38.560 --> 41:42.640
Oh, I say, that was brave! Not
accurate, but brave! It looks slow!

41:42.640 --> 41:44.480
No, it's not.

41:44.480 --> 41:48.120
Excuse my language. Oh, BLEEP!

41:49.720 --> 41:51.880
Potty mouth!

41:51.880 --> 41:55.720
That's impressive, nobody's gonna
complain about that.

41:55.720 --> 41:58.240
I just passed my driving test...

41:58.240 --> 42:01.280
I really should not be doing this.

42:01.280 --> 42:04.520
I love the straight-out
arm position. I know!

42:04.520 --> 42:07.040
It looks so slow! It doesn't!

42:07.040 --> 42:09.720
It looks the same as this
every week.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.680
Oh, BLEEP!

42:11.680 --> 42:15.440
I'm letting women down!
There's nothing wrong with it!

42:17.960 --> 42:20.560
That's quick. How will you be
through the tyres...?

42:20.560 --> 42:23.360
Oh, my God! Mummy!

42:24.440 --> 42:26.480
Holy cow!

42:26.480 --> 42:28.840
That is fast!

42:28.840 --> 42:31.000
You're having a crisis!

42:32.040 --> 42:35.240
Oh, it's off again! And you held it!

42:35.240 --> 42:37.960
Yes, you got it! That's it, Gambon!

42:37.960 --> 42:42.040
And you made it across the line!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

42:42.040 --> 42:44.280
That's a cracking lap!

42:46.600 --> 42:49.560
Now... Oh, God!

42:49.560 --> 42:53.560
So, where do you think, then,
on the...?

42:53.560 --> 42:57.760
It felt quite slow, watching it
back. It felt so fast
when I was doing it!

42:57.760 --> 43:01.120
I have no idea. Tell me it's good.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.360
You did it, Sienna Miller, in...

43:04.360 --> 43:05.720
one minute...

43:07.160 --> 43:08.760
..forty...

43:08.760 --> 43:10.880
AUDIENCE: Ooooh!

43:10.880 --> 43:13.720
..9.8 seconds! Yeah!

43:13.720 --> 43:17.640
That is not bad because
that puts you... Oh!

43:17.640 --> 43:21.000
What a nice place to be!

43:21.000 --> 43:25.280
That's all right!
Anything above 1 minute 50

43:25.280 --> 43:29.640
we always say is quick. OK. I beat
Gambon, that's a first. You beat
Michael Gambon, Alan Davies,

43:29.640 --> 43:34.040
Steve Coogan. For someone
who's never driven a manual car,

43:34.040 --> 43:36.640
and only been driving a week,
it was amazing!

43:36.640 --> 43:39.760
Thanks! Now, best of luck
with your new film. Thank you.

43:39.760 --> 43:42.400
Ladies and gentlemen, Sienna Miller!
Thank you!

43:42.400 --> 43:46.680
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING
Thank you! Was that all right?

43:52.880 --> 43:56.480
Now, tonight we are in France,

43:56.480 --> 44:01.040
demonstrating the virtues
of rear-wheel drive with one
of our Cheap Car Challenges.

44:01.040 --> 44:06.280
When we left the action, I'd crashed
into a piano, and we were on our way
to a ski resort in the Alps.

44:06.280 --> 44:09.240
All three of our £1,500 cars
are running well,

44:09.240 --> 44:12.960
so none of us is in danger of needing
the back-up car, a Morris Marina,

44:12.960 --> 44:14.360
which is a good thing,

44:14.360 --> 44:17.720
because we're bound to break it,
and the Morris Marina Owners Club

44:17.720 --> 44:19.840
already sort of hates us

44:19.840 --> 44:21.800
and wants to kill us.

44:29.520 --> 44:32.960
All is perfect
aboard the mighty Nissan.

44:32.960 --> 44:35.640
All was perfect in the Porsche too.

44:35.640 --> 44:37.520
However...

44:37.520 --> 44:40.360
There's something coming out
from under the bonnet.

44:40.360 --> 44:43.440
Did they forecast fog in your car
this morning, James?

44:43.440 --> 44:48.640
It's like driving through a horror
film. Chaps, my car's started
making some really bad noises.

44:48.640 --> 44:50.120
Started?!

44:50.120 --> 44:51.880
'We had to pull over.'

44:51.880 --> 44:56.240
# Marina... #
LAUGHTER

44:56.240 --> 44:59.200
I wish this was smelly-vision,
because you would not...

44:59.200 --> 45:03.520
That smell of a car. You know when
a body's been in a flat for
nine months

45:03.520 --> 45:07.640
and people ring up and say...
That's a distinctive smell.
..there is a smell.

45:07.640 --> 45:11.640
You really think you're gonna get
that going? Yeah. You're just not!

45:13.960 --> 45:15.600
'We decided to help...

45:15.600 --> 45:17.000
'by leaving.'

45:17.000 --> 45:21.480
I'm just thinking, on these big
foreign Top Gear cheap car
challenges,

45:21.480 --> 45:23.680
the cars always make it.

45:23.680 --> 45:27.080
And James won't want to be the one
that lets the side down.

45:33.320 --> 45:37.560
I don't know if you can see this,
but I've got some fairly dramatic

45:37.560 --> 45:41.600
wheel wobble going on here.
RATTLING

45:41.600 --> 45:43.120
I can fix this.

45:43.120 --> 45:46.400
I can fix anything.

45:51.280 --> 45:53.480
'With my new mending powers,

45:53.480 --> 45:55.880
'I worked out
I'd lost a wheel weight.'

45:55.880 --> 45:59.080
How much, 5g, something like that,
possibly? Goodbye, Jeremy.

45:59.080 --> 46:02.280
'Hammond decided to help
by leaving.'

46:02.280 --> 46:03.680
It just needs some weight.

46:03.680 --> 46:07.160
Funny euros!
They're like wheel weights.

46:07.160 --> 46:11.640
Sometimes, I amaze even myself

46:11.640 --> 46:12.800
with my brilliance.

46:12.800 --> 46:14.200
Gaffer tape them on.

46:14.200 --> 46:16.040
Let's go.

46:18.080 --> 46:19.680
It's worked!

46:19.680 --> 46:21.840
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

46:21.840 --> 46:24.320
At 60, the exact speed it was bad,

46:24.320 --> 46:26.800
it's now perfect.

46:26.800 --> 46:29.000
RATTLING STARTS AGAIN

46:29.000 --> 46:32.120
However, at 62...

46:34.760 --> 46:37.960
'At the next town, Hammond and I
re-grouped to wait for May.'

46:37.960 --> 46:42.720
Can I just say, we've now been
waiting, what, half an hour?
Easy, yeah.

46:42.720 --> 46:44.760
Now, if it's... More, 40 minutes.

46:44.760 --> 46:48.040
If it's 40 minutes,
he must have mended the Capri.

46:48.040 --> 46:51.160
Because if it was ruined, he would
have just got in the Marina,

46:51.160 --> 46:53.000
so he must be in the Capri.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.360
'My logic was exactly 100%...

46:56.360 --> 46:57.400
'wrong.'

46:57.400 --> 47:00.200
HE'S HERE!

47:00.200 --> 47:03.040
Oh, God, it's Pinky and Perky!

47:03.040 --> 47:07.200
He's failed!
Let's embrace the failure.

47:07.200 --> 47:10.720
That suits you. Thank you. It does,
I'm sorry. You know we've had
problems

47:10.720 --> 47:16.080
with the Morris Marina Owners' Club?
Problems?! They declared a fatwa
on us! Exactly. This car... Mmm.

47:16.080 --> 47:20.160
..you have to understand this,
belonged to the wife of
the president. Right.

47:20.160 --> 47:26.400
Just take care of it. Your comments
should be addressed to... Ahem! Why?

47:26.400 --> 47:29.520
I don't want you to drive into this.
This used to belong...

47:29.520 --> 47:33.160
to the wife of the President of...
Where was it? France. ..France.

47:36.680 --> 47:42.280
'Hammond really wasn't impressed
with James' new wheels.'

47:42.280 --> 47:47.360
I'll guarantee that nothing exciting,
vibrant, dynamic,

47:47.360 --> 47:49.800
new, creative,

47:49.800 --> 47:55.000
hopeful or beneficial in any way
to humanity has ever been done,

47:55.000 --> 47:58.360
thought of, or driven to
in that drab,

47:58.360 --> 48:03.760
dreary, entirely beige,
wilfully awful pile of misery!

48:03.760 --> 48:06.800
Oh, come on, it's not so bad.

48:07.880 --> 48:10.160
Erm, it's well-equipped.

48:10.160 --> 48:13.440
No, it isn't well-equipped,
to be honest, it's got one dial.

48:13.440 --> 48:15.520
It's tastefully upholstered.

48:15.520 --> 48:19.960
It isn't tastefully upholstered,
really, it's brown.

48:19.960 --> 48:23.400
But the seats are velour,
and look how well it's worn.

48:26.720 --> 48:30.040
'Soon, we began to climb into
the mountains.'

48:32.360 --> 48:34.720
Now, look at this. We have snow.

48:34.720 --> 48:38.920
And if we have ice, I have
the chassis to deal with it.

48:39.880 --> 48:42.440
This is more like it!

48:42.440 --> 48:45.240
Don't tell me rear-wheel drive
isn't more fun on this road.

48:46.720 --> 48:48.920
TYRES SCREECH

48:48.920 --> 48:50.520
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

48:50.520 --> 48:53.880
Come on, Hammond, live with this!

48:53.880 --> 48:55.200
This is brilliant.

48:55.200 --> 48:57.200
£1,500.

48:57.200 --> 49:01.600
Drives down here, hardly uses
any fuel and now look at it!

49:01.600 --> 49:03.120
Belting up an alp.

49:03.120 --> 49:05.240
TYRES SCREECH

49:05.240 --> 49:09.320
Twisty, this is where the
Morris Marina comes into its own.

49:09.320 --> 49:10.560
CLUNKING

49:10.560 --> 49:12.800
'Meanwhile, further up the road,

49:12.800 --> 49:15.880
'I'd had an idea.'

49:15.880 --> 49:19.200
Now, remember, viewers,
Hammond broke my drum kit. So,

49:19.200 --> 49:21.760
as he waits down there
for James to arrive...

49:25.120 --> 49:26.600
Oh, God!
JEREMY LAUGHS

49:26.600 --> 49:28.600
What if it were to go down the hill?

49:28.600 --> 49:30.600
Very funny!

49:30.600 --> 49:32.800
Oh, no! Oh, my God!

49:32.800 --> 49:36.480
Oh, I'm sorry(!) What do I do now?!

49:38.400 --> 49:40.360
May's here. Oh, joy!

49:40.360 --> 49:42.000
Did you break my drum kit?

49:42.000 --> 49:45.240
Yes! Have you got a cold car now?
Not...

49:45.240 --> 49:46.480
No, not cold...

49:46.480 --> 49:47.920
I'm going to die!

49:47.920 --> 49:52.320
Fantastic! Driving a car
that terrible...that old.

49:52.320 --> 49:56.360
See his Targa roof? Yeah.
LAUGHTER

49:56.360 --> 49:59.880
It may have fallen in the raging
torrents. I've no idea how(!)

50:04.200 --> 50:07.320
The faster I make him drive,
the colder he'll be.

50:07.320 --> 50:08.960
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

50:08.960 --> 50:10.160
That's quite cold now.

50:10.160 --> 50:11.960
Really very cold, in fact.

50:11.960 --> 50:14.720
That does mean war, I'd say.

50:16.560 --> 50:20.280
'As night fell, we reached
Val Thorens, still wondering

50:20.280 --> 50:23.760
'what our final challenge might be.'

50:23.760 --> 50:25.720
Rear-wheel drive...

50:27.040 --> 50:28.480
..on an alp.

50:28.480 --> 50:33.080
'The answer lay
just round the next bend.'

50:41.240 --> 50:43.040
Is that an ice driving track?

50:44.080 --> 50:47.840
'It was. And the next morning,
the producers had entered us

50:47.840 --> 50:49.200
'for a race on it.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.840
'However, between us and it,

50:51.840 --> 50:53.760
'there was a small hill.'

50:53.760 --> 50:55.120
Watch this.

51:02.800 --> 51:05.000
Agh!

51:06.920 --> 51:09.880
And there he is!
JEREMY LAUGHS

51:09.880 --> 51:14.000
'Using Top Gear logic,
I applied even more speed.'

51:15.800 --> 51:19.600
Oh, dear, no!
That's not gone at all well.

51:20.840 --> 51:23.560
'Eventually, some locals
helped us onto the track,

51:23.560 --> 51:26.280
'where we decided to get
some practice.'

51:28.080 --> 51:29.560
Easy.

51:29.560 --> 51:32.040
Gentleness is the... Oh. BLEEP!

51:33.160 --> 51:36.640
'It was unbelievably slippery.'

51:36.640 --> 51:38.320
Oi!

51:38.320 --> 51:42.320
He's pushing me up with his wing
mirror. Get off my racing line!

51:43.360 --> 51:47.840
You blithering idiot!
Don't keep doing that to me!

51:47.840 --> 51:51.640
How is this racing?
It's just fighting!

51:51.640 --> 51:54.360
It's just not racing.

51:54.360 --> 51:56.680
Aah! Aah! No!

51:56.680 --> 51:57.840
Oi, do you mind?!

51:57.840 --> 51:59.920
Oh, I'm gonna hit the Marina!

52:01.240 --> 52:05.280
'Ten minutes later,
we stormed into the first corner.'

52:05.280 --> 52:07.160
Yes, I'm winning, I'm winning!

52:07.160 --> 52:10.400
Get out of the way! I'm not winning!

52:12.520 --> 52:18.280
This doesn't work. It's impossible.
It's a very slow accident in slow
motion. Could we get snow tyres?

52:18.280 --> 52:20.880
Yes. Spiky things. Yes.
Snow tyres...

52:20.880 --> 52:23.360
and modify.

52:25.400 --> 52:28.320
'We were towed to the pits,
where we fitted spiked tyres,

52:28.320 --> 52:29.600
'roll cages...'

52:29.600 --> 52:32.520
I can't drive like this.
'..and because it was a race,

52:32.520 --> 52:34.560
'some sponsorship decals.'

52:35.680 --> 52:38.200
Oh...shit!

52:38.200 --> 52:39.240
I mean, bother.

52:39.240 --> 52:41.400
No! Does anyone have a hammer?

52:43.760 --> 52:47.960
'The next morning, Val Thorens
basked in glorious alpine sunshine.

52:50.240 --> 52:54.720
'Actually, it didn't,
because this is some film
from the Tourist Board. For us,

52:54.720 --> 52:57.120
'it looked like this...

53:01.440 --> 53:03.360
'No matter, at least our cars,

53:03.360 --> 53:06.240
'on their new spiked tyres,
were ready for battle.'

53:07.280 --> 53:08.880
Check it out.

53:08.880 --> 53:12.920
May I look inside your car, James?
Please do. It'll still be awful!

53:12.920 --> 53:16.640
Look at that! Can I say briefly,
from the outside,

53:16.640 --> 53:19.880
it does actually look quite good.
It looks quite serious.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.520
And then, Hammond... Yes?

53:21.520 --> 53:24.320
..I can see one massive problem
with your car. What?

53:24.320 --> 53:27.320
Ooh, dearie me! Yes.

53:27.320 --> 53:29.360
JAMES LAUGHS

53:29.360 --> 53:30.880
Look at that! Oh!

53:30.880 --> 53:32.960
Yes, I'm sitting in a snowdrift.

53:32.960 --> 53:36.480
How did you get your roll cage in,
in the end? Well, work.

53:36.480 --> 53:41.960
I've got door bars. Oh, well,
that's a very thorough set-up.
It's a very thorough job.

53:41.960 --> 53:46.200
Now, I'm looking forward to this,
because I think a Porsche
will look good drifting.

53:46.200 --> 53:48.640
You couldn't do this
with front-wheel drive.

53:51.640 --> 53:53.160
'We were feeling confident.

53:53.160 --> 53:57.920
'And when we saw the cars our French
rivals had, that confidence grew.'

53:57.920 --> 54:00.720
These are all just little hatchbacks.
That's a Kia.

54:00.720 --> 54:03.440
And a BMW 1 Series.

54:03.440 --> 54:07.560
I've got a V6 and a twin turbo.
This is the crib sheet, right,
on these cars, yes?

54:07.560 --> 54:10.200
They have a top speed of...

54:10.200 --> 54:11.440
80.

54:11.440 --> 54:14.480
Even your Marina
can go faster than that, 80.

54:14.480 --> 54:19.400
And it says here, "Cars rarely
exceed 50-60 mph during a race."

54:19.400 --> 54:24.440
Wow, look at that! I haven't got one
of those. Did you fit one of those on
your Marina? No. A windscreen wiper

54:24.440 --> 54:29.320
on the side. They're obviously
expecting to go sideways... Look!
..with their wayward handling.

54:31.520 --> 54:34.040
'The other drivers -
including a youth

54:34.040 --> 54:37.680
'and an old bloke - didn't look like
much of a threat either.

54:37.680 --> 54:41.320
'But then I spotted
a familiar face.'

54:41.320 --> 54:43.360
Where? There. It's Olivier Panis.

54:43.360 --> 54:45.520
What, the designer?

54:45.520 --> 54:48.000
Please tell me
you've heard of Olivier Panis?

54:48.000 --> 54:50.200
Panis is a type of Italian bread,
isn't it?

54:50.200 --> 54:54.080
Formula One racing driver.
Formula One.

54:54.080 --> 54:56.760
Won the Monaco Grand Prix.
Oh, I knew that. Really? Won it.

54:58.240 --> 55:02.440
I suppose it's unfair to ask for
tips when we're gonna thrash you,
but... Not at all.

55:02.440 --> 55:05.080
..what would you say we had to do
to not hit things?

55:05.080 --> 55:10.960
Well, it's quite hard, because
this car is four-wheel... Four-wheel
drive? Drive, yeah, and turning.

55:10.960 --> 55:15.160
The rear-wheel also turning... Oh.
..it means to turn the car
much quicker.

55:15.160 --> 55:16.320
Like yours. Yeah.

55:16.320 --> 55:20.480
It's very, very sporting of you to
let us bring Porsche, Nissan 300ZX.

55:20.480 --> 55:25.640
Much more powerful cars.
And the Morris. And the Morris.
It's like bringing, well, longbows

55:25.640 --> 55:26.920
to a bow and arrow fight.

55:26.920 --> 55:32.520
Yeah, it is, thank you. I thought
you were gonna say something really
inappropriate then. I did wonder!

55:32.520 --> 55:35.840
I mentioned Agincourt once,
but I think I got away with it.

55:39.320 --> 55:41.600
'With our romper suits on,

55:41.600 --> 55:44.720
'we lined up for the ten-lap race.'

55:44.720 --> 55:49.040
I cannot believe
I'm in a race with Olivier Panis,

55:49.040 --> 55:51.480
France's second best racing driver.

55:53.240 --> 55:57.680
Quite often, racers find it difficult
when they get too hot.

55:57.680 --> 56:00.560
This won't happen today.

56:02.160 --> 56:05.760
Here's my plan. I'm gonna take the
one in front on the left-hand side,

56:05.760 --> 56:09.960
cut across to the right,
then I'll be alongside Panis
for the first tight right-hander.

56:09.960 --> 56:13.880
He's bound to swing left,
they all do that in Formula One.

56:13.880 --> 56:16.000
I'm going right.
That'll surprise him.

56:22.360 --> 56:23.760
Here I go!

56:23.760 --> 56:25.680
We're off!

56:25.680 --> 56:29.080
They may have got away from us
a bit there. How did they do that?!

56:32.800 --> 56:35.840
'It turned out
they weren't crummy hatchbacks.

56:35.880 --> 56:39.720
'They were mid-engine rocket ships.

56:39.720 --> 56:43.000
'So immediately, we were lapped...'

56:43.000 --> 56:44.400
Oh, God!

56:44.400 --> 56:45.560
Oh, God!

56:45.560 --> 56:47.280
Sorry!

56:47.280 --> 56:50.920
'..and then immediately,
we were lapped again.'

56:50.920 --> 56:52.200
HELP!

56:52.200 --> 56:55.360
How many other cars...? HELP...ME!

56:55.360 --> 57:00.320
'This wasn't Agincourt,
this was the Battle of Hastings.'

57:00.320 --> 57:02.080
He's taken me.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.200
He's taken me.

57:03.200 --> 57:04.840
He's taken me as well.

57:06.320 --> 57:07.800
That's right, put me in there.

57:07.800 --> 57:12.160
No, no, really, help yourself(!)
We're being humiliated!

57:13.640 --> 57:15.720
You...cheese-eating...

57:15.720 --> 57:17.600
sideways monkeys!

57:19.080 --> 57:22.480
Olivier Panis found the Morris
particularly annoying.

57:22.480 --> 57:24.160
What is this shitbox?!

57:24.160 --> 57:26.280
What is this car?

57:26.280 --> 57:28.320
A Morris.

57:28.320 --> 57:30.760
Ow! Ow!

57:33.480 --> 57:36.440
'Soon, it became clear
there were two races going on.

57:36.440 --> 57:39.040
'One for people
who'd brought the right tools

57:39.040 --> 57:41.960
'and one for those who WERE tools.'

57:43.320 --> 57:45.760
I can't see a bloody thing!

57:45.760 --> 57:48.720
Argh! I pulled my own glove off!

57:49.960 --> 57:51.360
Try a Scandinavian flick.

57:51.360 --> 57:52.880
No!

57:52.880 --> 57:55.600
No! Oh, what the... BLEEP ?!

57:59.200 --> 58:03.480
OK, that's them going past.
That was that Oliver man again.

58:06.440 --> 58:08.480
I'm being lapped again!

58:09.680 --> 58:14.400
'To make matters worse, Hammond had
turned our race into
a grudge match.'

58:14.400 --> 58:17.000
No! What the hell?!

58:17.000 --> 58:23.280
Ha-ha-ha! That's for throwing my roof
away, you fool! You're going off.

58:23.280 --> 58:25.600
You're going off. No!

58:25.600 --> 58:28.440
No! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

58:30.680 --> 58:32.440
'Unfortunately...

58:33.440 --> 58:36.360
'..as we knocked seven bells
out of each other...'

58:36.360 --> 58:38.400
Sorry, mate. What are you doing?

58:38.400 --> 58:41.560
Why are you doing this to me?!
Ha-ha!

58:41.560 --> 58:44.280
'..James was sneaking up
from the rear.'

58:44.280 --> 58:45.560
Power.

58:45.560 --> 58:47.040
Power.

58:47.040 --> 58:48.520
What there is of it.

58:48.520 --> 58:49.800
He's got me back.

58:49.800 --> 58:51.680
Whoa!

58:52.840 --> 58:54.560
May's got us!

58:54.560 --> 58:56.360
That's a pass for the Marina!

58:57.920 --> 58:59.880
You stupid idiot, Hammond!

58:59.880 --> 59:03.400
'At this point,
the French race finished.

59:03.400 --> 59:07.480
'And with them out of the way,
I set off after May.'

59:07.480 --> 59:10.520
Right, come on,
must be able to catch a Marina.

59:10.520 --> 59:13.440
Nice and smooth and straight.
Where's the corner?

59:13.440 --> 59:14.760
There he is.

59:14.760 --> 59:17.120
May is in my sight.

59:17.120 --> 59:21.000
'I now had less than a lap
to get past.'

59:21.000 --> 59:23.360
Don't hit him!

59:23.360 --> 59:26.040
Morris extremists will come
if I hit him.

59:26.040 --> 59:31.120
I hope you're watching this,
wife of the President of...France!

59:32.520 --> 59:35.920
I don't believe it,
May's going to win!

59:37.120 --> 59:38.560
It's the flag!

59:40.360 --> 59:43.200
Surely not, not the Marina?!

59:45.680 --> 59:47.600
I'm gonna have to kill myself!

59:54.240 --> 59:56.160
Ah...

59:56.160 --> 59:59.040
I believe I won. Hammond, you idiot!
What?!

59:59.040 --> 01:00:03.200
You threw my roof away,
and as a result, the inside
of my windscreen froze up.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.160
Every time I went round a corner,
there was this wildly fishtailing
Datsun!

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:12.360
Every time I went smoothly round
a corner, there was some idiot
in a multi-blue Porsche ramming me

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:16.880
and sticking me in the ditch!
I believe this is what's know as
racing drivers' excuses, isn't it?

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:22.080
No, I'll tell you what I believe.
What? I believe that as a result of
our... Erm, exuberance.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.960
..revenge... Yes.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.560
..we must now conclude

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:28.080
that the best rear-wheel drive car

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.840
that money can buy
is the Morris Marina!

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.640
Yes! And do you know what? What?

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:36.680
I think the Morris Marina
Owners' Club are gonna be
thrilled with that.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.320
I think it will finally make amends.
They'll forgive us. They will,
finally! Finally.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.280
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.280
What are we gonna do?!
What are we gonna do?!

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:03.560
We're gonna be killed and eaten
by Morrismen! Look, we did explain
in the last series that we're based

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.360
next to an air-freight piano removal
company. Absolutely.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:11.040
They're called Careless Air. Yes.
And now, they have a French
sister company

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:17.520
called Piano Avion Malheureusement.
Yes, I read about that in Helicopter
News - they're based in Val Thorens.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:22.200
Exactly. So, if you're watching,
Carla Bruni, OK, wife of
the President of France,

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.320
it wasn't our fault your Marina got
broken. No. And now, gentlemen,

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.760
if I might make a suggestion...

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.880
run! Yeah, good one. See you
next week, everyone! Bye! Bye!
