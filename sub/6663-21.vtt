00:01.234 --> 00:02.968
(alarm blaring)

00:02.970 --> 00:06.271
Adult adam:  <i>There's only</i>
<i>one reason a teenage girl</i>
<i>leaps out of bed</i>

00:06.273 --> 00:09.274
<i>This happy on a school day...</i>
<i>First love.</i>

00:09.276 --> 00:12.644
<i>For my sister,</i>
<i>it was our neighbor</i>
<i>across the street...</i>

00:12.646 --> 00:15.147
<i>Drew kremp.</i>

00:15.615 --> 00:20.052
<i>And, man, oh, man,</i>
<i>things got real serious</i>
<i>real fast.</i>

00:20.054 --> 00:22.688
Listen, I know
we've only been dating
for a few weeks,

00:22.690 --> 00:25.391
But there's something
I've got to ask you.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.293
Huh?
Erica elizabeth goldberg,

00:28.295 --> 00:29.461
Will you...
My middle name's dorothy,

00:29.463 --> 00:31.830
But that... That's okay.
Uh, whatever you're gonna say,
just say it.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.899
Will you wear
my varsity jacket?

00:33.901 --> 00:35.167
(laughs) yes!

00:35.169 --> 00:35.834
Yes, I will!

00:35.836 --> 00:37.302
Adult adam:
<i>The varsity jacket...</i>

00:37.304 --> 00:40.239
<i>The high-school equivalent</i>
<i>of a marriage proposal.</i>

00:40.241 --> 00:41.140
Oh, my god.
It's like a slipper...

00:41.142 --> 00:43.442
Like a glass slipper,
but it's not!
It's a jacket!

00:43.444 --> 00:45.077
Adult adam:
<i>My moody, angry sister</i>

00:45.079 --> 00:48.981
<i>Had somehow been replaced by</i>
<i>a giddy, love-struck teenager.</i>

00:48.983 --> 00:51.917
Mmm! Mom, so good.

00:51.919 --> 00:55.387
I don't say this enough,
but I love tacos.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.688
And I love my family.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.358
Adult adam:
<i>We called it</i>
<i>the time of great peace.</i>

00:59.360 --> 01:01.193
<i>For some, it was confusing.</i>

01:01.195 --> 01:03.295
I think she's on drugs.

01:03.297 --> 01:06.198
A-are you hopped up
on goofballs?

01:06.200 --> 01:07.733
You're the cutest!

01:07.735 --> 01:08.834
Adult adam:
<i>We've all been there.</i>

01:08.836 --> 01:10.502
<i>It's the happiest time</i>
<i>in a young person's life.</i>

01:10.504 --> 01:14.473
<i>Your head's in the clouds,</i>
<i>and nothing will</i>
<i>bring you down...</i>

01:14.475 --> 01:15.707
(horns blaring)

01:15.709 --> 01:17.943
Oh. Sorry!
Have a great day.

01:18.111 --> 01:18.644
(sobbing)

01:18.646 --> 01:21.246
<i>Except when</i>
<i>your first love</i>
<i>dumps your ass</i>

01:21.248 --> 01:22.381
<i>For no reason at all.</i>

01:22.383 --> 01:24.583
Boopie, what's wrong?
What is it?

01:24.585 --> 01:26.051
Come, sit. Tell mama.

01:26.053 --> 01:29.054
(whining indistinctly)

01:29.689 --> 01:31.457
What are you saying?

01:31.459 --> 01:33.659
(whining)

01:33.993 --> 01:36.962
Are you physically hurt?

01:36.964 --> 01:40.966
(whimpering)
did someone drop
something on you?

01:40.968 --> 01:42.334
And then... And then...

01:42.336 --> 01:44.169
And then...
I can't understand you.

01:44.171 --> 01:46.772
(sobbing)
she said drew kremp
drove her home today

01:46.774 --> 01:49.908
In his sweet mustang
and dumped her
out of nowhere.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.210
(whining)

01:51.212 --> 01:53.345
How the hell did
you understand her?

01:53.347 --> 01:53.946
As most of you know,

01:53.948 --> 01:57.382
I've, uh, spent a majority
of my life hysterical
and emotionally

01:57.384 --> 01:59.218
Out of control.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.019
I speak the language.

02:01.021 --> 02:01.653
(whimpering)

02:01.655 --> 02:03.655
She'd like some hot tea
with a little bit of honey.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.992
<i>And with that,</i>
<i>the time of great peace</i>
<i>descended</i>

02:06.994 --> 02:08.060
<i>Into the age of darkness.</i>

02:08.062 --> 02:13.465
<i>My strong, independent sister</i>
<i>turned into an irrational</i>
<i>hot mess.</i>

02:13.467 --> 02:14.967
<i>She moped in her room.</i>

02:14.969 --> 02:16.635
<i>She sobbed in her car.</i>

02:16.637 --> 02:17.603
(horns blaring)

02:17.605 --> 02:19.905
<i>And she wept through dinner.</i>

02:19.907 --> 02:21.673
Sweetie, you have to eat.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.309
Food reminds me of drew.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.812
He used to eat food.

02:26.814 --> 02:30.816
Baby, if you don't eat,
then I have failed
as a mother.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.384
Then you have failed.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.653
We all have failed.

02:34.754 --> 02:37.156
Just take them!
Just take the tots!

02:37.158 --> 02:40.259
Peanut, believe me,
it's his loss.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.194
I am dead inside,

02:42.196 --> 02:46.298
And that's what you say
to me?

02:47.066 --> 02:48.934
She said
she's dead inside...

02:48.936 --> 02:51.103
I know what she said!

02:51.204 --> 02:52.371
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:52.373 --> 02:56.108
<i>♪ but nonetheless</i>
<i>I feel the need to say</i>

02:58.478 --> 02:59.745
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

02:59.747 --> 03:04.449
<i>♪ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i>clearer every day ♪</i>

03:04.884 --> 03:06.985
<i>It was April 29,</i>
<i>1980-something,</i>

03:06.987 --> 03:07.986
<i>And barry and I</i>
<i>were strolling</i>

03:07.988 --> 03:11.190
<i>Into the one place</i>
<i>that gave us</i>
<i>pure joy like no other.</i>

03:11.192 --> 03:13.392
<i>That's right...</i>
<i>The arcade.</i>

03:13.394 --> 03:15.928
We're home.
Al: Here you go, boys.

03:15.930 --> 03:17.596
Have fun
with your beep-bop-boop.

03:17.598 --> 03:20.165
<i>Back then, you couldn't just</i>
<i>download a game to your phone.</i>

03:20.167 --> 03:22.501
<i>You needed a roll of quarters</i>
<i>and nerves of steel.</i>

03:22.503 --> 03:25.604
<i>First we'd play the classics</i>
<i>like "pac-man" and</i>
<i>"centipede."</i>

03:25.606 --> 03:28.540
<i>Then we'd blow most of our</i>
<i>quarters on "dragon's lair."</i>

03:28.542 --> 03:31.176
How'd they get a cartoon
into a video game?

03:31.178 --> 03:34.079
You're so dumb.
They pour it in the top.

03:34.081 --> 03:36.315
<i>But our jam was "zaxxon."</i>

03:36.317 --> 03:38.650
<i>It was the greatest game</i>
<i>ever made...</i>

03:38.652 --> 03:41.987
<i>Until they made a better one.</i>

03:53.433 --> 03:55.567
(bell clanging)

03:58.871 --> 04:00.372
<i>It was called "punch-out!"</i>

04:00.374 --> 04:02.741
<i>It combined everything</i>
<i>my brother loved...</i>

04:02.743 --> 04:03.642
<i>Video games, sports,</i>

04:03.644 --> 04:05.244
<i>And graphic,</i>
<i>senseless violence.</i>

04:05.246 --> 04:09.114
We're gonna get to know
each other real good.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.816
<i>While we were lost</i>
<i>in our world of video games,</i>

04:10.818 --> 04:14.086
<i>My mom was gonna help erica</i>
<i>get clarity on the break-up.</i>

04:14.088 --> 04:16.355
<i>She went across the street</i>
<i>to virginia kremp,</i>

04:16.357 --> 04:18.957
<i>Her best friend</i>
<i>and drew's mother.</i>

04:18.959 --> 04:20.559
Hi!
Hi.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.394
Hi.
Hi.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.595
Hi.
Hi.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.863
How's erica holding up?

04:24.865 --> 04:26.898
Ugh, she's a mess.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.100
How's drew?

04:28.102 --> 04:28.700
He's great.
Hmm?

04:28.702 --> 04:31.737
I mean, you know, he's good.
He's... He's fine.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.773
He just went to
the water park,
which is...

04:35.074 --> 04:36.608
Where he goes
when he's sad.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.443
That way
no one can see his tears.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.178
You know, it would
really help erica

04:40.180 --> 04:42.080
If you could just tell me
what happened.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.716
Ooh, I'm not sure
that's our business, bev.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.052
Isn't it, though?
Hmm...

04:47.054 --> 04:49.187
Mmm. Mmm...
Mmm?

04:49.856 --> 04:52.057
Mmm-mmm.

04:52.258 --> 04:52.658
Ohh.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.494
I just think that drew
needs some time alone
to figure himself out.

04:55.496 --> 04:59.931
Well, do you think
he'll have himself figured out
in the next two days or so?

04:59.933 --> 05:00.565
Probably not.

05:00.567 --> 05:01.933
Oh, just
one more quick question...

05:01.935 --> 05:05.037
Uh, what is the name
of drew's new bimbo?

05:05.039 --> 05:06.004
Beverly,
there's no one.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.674
So you're saying that drew's
made a terrible mistake,

05:08.676 --> 05:10.309
And it's just gonna be
a matter of time

05:10.311 --> 05:12.277
Before he comes
crawling back?

05:12.279 --> 05:13.845
Hmm...
Mmm?

05:13.847 --> 05:15.047
Mmm-mmm.
Uh...

05:15.049 --> 05:16.648
Mmm-mmm.
Well, you better tell drew

05:16.650 --> 05:17.783
Not to take too long
to figure things out

05:17.785 --> 05:22.421
'cause, uh, erica's got
a lot of guys coming around.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.122
Lot of guys.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.324
And one girl.
(chuckles)

05:25.326 --> 05:30.595
She's not gonna
do anything about that,
but, uh... Still flattering.

05:30.797 --> 05:31.496
Think about it.

05:31.498 --> 05:35.233
<i>Barry had</i>
<i>spent the past week</i>
<i>trying to beat "punch-out!"</i>

05:35.235 --> 05:36.001
<i>Just one problem...</i>

05:36.003 --> 05:39.171
<i>He was out of quarters</i>
<i>and had grown desperate.</i>

05:39.405 --> 05:40.072
A penny?

05:40.074 --> 05:42.607
Worthless!
It's the garbage of money!

05:42.609 --> 05:43.909
(penny clatters)

05:43.911 --> 05:47.879
Hey!
Pops-aroni, looking good.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.682
Did you lose some weight
or just get a haircut?

05:50.684 --> 05:51.917
Oh, what can I say?

05:51.919 --> 05:53.585
I've been hit
by the handsome stick.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.287
Well, you look like
a million bucks.

05:55.289 --> 05:58.090
Speaking of a million bucks,
can you float me a $20?

05:58.092 --> 06:00.058
Is this for
the arcade again?

06:00.060 --> 06:02.327
This is the fourth time
this week.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.328
I got to cut you off, kiddo.

06:03.330 --> 06:06.098
You can't cut me off.
You're my grandfather!

06:06.100 --> 06:07.132
You're supposed
to give me

06:07.134 --> 06:08.567
Unconditional
love and money
until you pass!

06:08.569 --> 06:11.870
I got three chicks
on the string right now.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.472
I got to manage
my cash flow.

06:13.474 --> 06:17.042
Be selfish.
I'll find money
somewhere else.

06:17.844 --> 06:18.977
Hey, ad-rock!

06:18.979 --> 06:21.146
What do you say
we go down to the arcade?

06:21.148 --> 06:22.514
It'll only cost you $20.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.449
Sorry, I got a spelling test
tomorrow.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.818
Why are you being
such a (bleep)

06:26.820 --> 06:30.622
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy! Easy! Easy!

06:31.090 --> 06:32.090
Sorry.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.325
Lost my cool.

06:33.327 --> 06:35.160
I'm fine.
Okay.

06:35.162 --> 06:35.827
I got money.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.363
I'll just cash in
the $100 bond
you gave me last year.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.799
That doesn't mature
for another 10 years.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.300
It's hardly worth anything
right now.

06:42.302 --> 06:45.137
You're a filthy liar,
old man!

06:45.139 --> 06:46.338
Nope.

06:46.340 --> 06:48.006
I did it again.
Lost my cool.

06:48.008 --> 06:52.277
I'm just...
Constantly thinking
about that game.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.646
You know
what I'm saying?

06:54.648 --> 06:55.680
It's cool.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.283
It's cool. It's cool.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.051
(sighs)
what are you
guys watching?

07:00.053 --> 07:03.488
I'm gonna go take a walk.
I'm gonna go take a walk.

07:05.725 --> 07:06.758
Hey, dale.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.993
Guess who cashed in
his $100 bond

07:07.995 --> 07:12.030
And is now sitting on
6 bucks of cold,
hard change.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.399
I don't care.
(sighs)

07:26.446 --> 07:28.013
(sighs)

07:28.015 --> 07:29.281
That's the stuff.

07:29.283 --> 07:32.484
Figuring himself out?
What does that even mean?

07:32.486 --> 07:35.687
It means it's not you.
It's him.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.087
Please.

07:36.089 --> 07:39.324
That's what people always say,
and it's total bullcrap.

07:39.326 --> 07:40.091
Please believe me.

07:40.093 --> 07:43.361
You're tearing me apart.
I can't see you this sad.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.230
Just tell me
you're better.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.031
I'm not better.

07:46.033 --> 07:49.534
My mood ring's been black
for three days!

07:49.536 --> 07:51.136
Then fake it...For me.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.338
I wore my nightgown
to school today.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.374
I'm in agony.
I can't take it anymore.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.976
Wow. Way to make it
about you, mom.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.678
No, no, no.
This is not about me.

07:59.680 --> 08:04.382
It's about you feeling better
so I can feel better.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.518
Make me feel better.
Better?

08:06.520 --> 08:09.421
All I know
is that I can't
feel any worse.

08:09.423 --> 08:11.723
(tires screeching)

08:12.825 --> 08:13.992
(gasps)

08:13.994 --> 08:15.227
Are you kidding me?

08:15.229 --> 08:17.362
Shame on you,
virginia kremp!

08:17.364 --> 08:19.464
You told me
there was nobody else!

08:19.466 --> 08:21.399
Right to my face,
you told me!

08:21.401 --> 08:23.802
Oh, my god!
Tracy sullivan?

08:23.804 --> 08:25.237
Are you
freaking kidding me?

08:25.239 --> 08:28.840
When I asked you if
you thought she was pretty,
you said, "nah."

08:28.842 --> 08:29.741
You said, "nah"!

08:29.743 --> 08:30.742
He was just
trying to spare her.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.778
So that's what you meant
when you said he needed
to figure himself out?

08:33.780 --> 08:36.882
Both: I was just trying
to spare your feelings!

08:36.884 --> 08:39.451
Well, here's your stupid
varsity jacket back!

08:39.453 --> 08:42.087
Use it to cover up
tracy's stupid face!

08:42.089 --> 08:45.924
Yeah!
Sorry, tracy, I know
this isn't about you.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.626
Yeah!

08:47.960 --> 08:51.129
I can't believe
that this is happening.

08:51.131 --> 08:54.232
Nope.
Put those tissues
down, missy.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.768
I'm gonna fix this.
You know how?

08:56.770 --> 08:59.271
Mama's gonna find you
someone better.

08:59.273 --> 09:00.438
That's right.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.174
There are plenty
of other fish in the sea.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.076
(hisses)

09:07.179 --> 09:09.047
I'll go.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.450
<i>Erica had gone</i>
<i>through six pans of brownies</i>
<i>since the break-up.</i>

09:12.452 --> 09:15.754
<i>Fortunately, my dad stepped in</i>
<i>to help with words of wisdom.</i>

09:15.756 --> 09:18.089
Hi, peanut.
Hmm.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.325
Uh, I'm gonna shut
this off.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.259
(grunts)

09:21.261 --> 09:23.428
Look, every time
I try and cheer you up,

09:23.430 --> 09:25.931
I end up saying
the wrong thing.
(grunts)

09:25.933 --> 09:28.934
So this time
I'm not gonna
say anything.

09:28.936 --> 09:32.871
I'm gonna let an old friend
do the talking for me.

09:33.906 --> 09:34.773
Sting.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.576
<i>"if you love somebody,</i>
<i>set them free."</i>

09:37.578 --> 09:40.078
Wise words,
don't you think?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.880
You know what I think?

09:41.882 --> 09:44.883
What are you doing?
Why would you do that?

09:44.885 --> 09:45.717
Who does that?

09:45.719 --> 09:47.485
Murray, what are you doing?
Why are you in here?

09:47.487 --> 09:50.221
I had good intentions!
I went to my guy at sam goody.

09:50.223 --> 09:54.326
His name is randy,
and he's getting over
someone, too.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.127
She's a wild animal.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.463
Don't help! Get!

09:59.799 --> 10:00.632
He's right.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.335
Look at me.
I'm an animal.

10:03.337 --> 10:04.769
(garbled)
I'm an animal.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.339
Stop that.
Stop it!
But...

10:07.341 --> 10:10.141
Lainey's birthday is tonight,
and, damn it, you're going.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.744
No way.
Lainey's your best friend.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.846
Well, lainey's
also friends with tracy,

10:14.848 --> 10:15.981
Which means
that drew will be there.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.949
Even better.
And you want
to know why?

10:17.951 --> 10:22.687
They are gonna freak
when you walk into that
restaurant with a college guy.

10:22.689 --> 10:23.321
What college guy?

10:23.323 --> 10:26.625
I was at dr. Kaczander's
earlier, and it seems his son,
bruce,

10:26.627 --> 10:28.293
Is single and
ready to mingle.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.696
I am not going out
with your podiatrist's son
named bruce.

10:31.698 --> 10:33.565
He goes to penn,
he's a classics major,

10:33.567 --> 10:37.002
And he drives a way
cooler car than drew.

10:37.004 --> 10:40.238
Cooler than a mustang 5.0?

10:40.240 --> 10:41.373
Yes. A saab.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.541
A saab?
What the hell is that?

10:43.543 --> 10:44.442
It's swedish.
It's sporty.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.612
It's got a key in the middle,
next to the armrest.

10:47.614 --> 10:48.480
It's like a spaceship.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.382
Drew is gonna see you
with that college hunk,

10:50.384 --> 10:53.752
Go crazy with jealousy,
and regret treating you
this way.

10:53.754 --> 10:57.689
<i>And with that,</i>
<i>beverly goldberg's matchmaking</i>
<i>skills saved the day.</i>

10:57.691 --> 10:59.224
<i>Amazingly, bruce,</i>
<i>the podiatrist's son,</i>

10:59.226 --> 11:03.495
<i>Was an uncanny mix</i>
<i>of patrick swayze</i>
<i>and patrick dempsey.</i>

11:03.497 --> 11:06.731
<i>Not even drew kremp</i>
<i>could deny it.</i>

11:06.733 --> 11:07.832
Hi. This is bruce.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.868
He's in college.
Look at him.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.836
You...
Can sit next to me.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.438
Scoot. Scoot. Down.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.706
You must be lainey.
Yes.

11:14.708 --> 11:18.743
I brought you
a little something
for your birthday.

11:18.745 --> 11:19.444
It's my favorite sake.

11:19.446 --> 11:22.347
He has a favorite sake, yeah,
and he drives a saab.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.683
<i>As erica's surprise for drew</i>
<i>was paying off,</i>

11:24.685 --> 11:28.620
<i>Pops and I had a surprise</i>
<i>of our own for barry.</i>

11:31.424 --> 11:32.123
Hey.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.958
Barry,
please have a seat.

11:33.960 --> 11:34.693
What's going on?

11:34.695 --> 11:39.764
Well, we're all here
because we love you
and we care about you

11:39.766 --> 11:41.933
And we want to see you
get better.

11:41.935 --> 11:42.634
It's an intervention.

11:42.636 --> 11:45.203
We invited
all your friends over
to tell you how we feel.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.673
But only roger's here.
I was the 10th person
they called.

11:48.675 --> 11:49.841
Shut up, roger.
Hmm.

11:49.843 --> 11:54.946
(sighs) listen, you've been
spending way too much
time at the arcade.

11:54.948 --> 11:55.714
You're on edge.

11:55.716 --> 11:58.183
You've been neglecting
your schoolwork.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.684
You stopped showering.

11:59.686 --> 12:00.952
Who showers every day?

12:00.954 --> 12:04.122
What am I, the governor?
This is ridiculous!

12:04.124 --> 12:07.158
I don't have the problem.
You have the problem.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.093
What problem do we have?

12:08.095 --> 12:09.861
You're addicted
to being jerks!

12:09.863 --> 12:11.996
I can quit the arcade
any time I want.

12:11.998 --> 12:16.768
Barry, you're
scrounging around
for quarters right now.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.603
No, I'm not.

12:18.605 --> 12:23.108
I was looking for this fork.
'cause I'm gonna eat
coleslaw.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.343
Does that mean
I'm addicted
to coleslaw, too?

12:25.345 --> 12:27.412
I don't know.
I don't care anymore.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.147
This whole thing's
gotten very weird.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.783
Barry, please.
You cashed in your bonds.

12:31.785 --> 12:35.620
You emptied your piggy bank.
You sold your baseball cards.

12:35.622 --> 12:38.123
This arcade's
eating you alive.

12:38.125 --> 12:38.990
We care about you, dude.

12:38.992 --> 12:42.727
We want you around
for a long time.
Roger! Go!

12:43.729 --> 12:45.697
Maybe you're right.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.766
Maybe I do have a problem.

12:47.768 --> 12:48.700
There you go.

12:48.702 --> 12:51.870
Just know
we're always
here for you.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.739
We love you, kiddo.
I won't let you down.

12:54.741 --> 12:55.406
<i>But he did.</i>

12:55.408 --> 12:56.741
<i>And the first place</i>
<i>barry went...</i>

12:56.743 --> 12:59.310
<i>My room,</i>
<i>in search of pocket change.</i>

12:59.312 --> 13:00.512
Something.
Just something.

13:00.514 --> 13:04.349
<i>But what he found</i>
<i>was way more valuable.</i>

13:05.751 --> 13:08.086
How much
will you give me for this?

13:08.088 --> 13:08.953
Three bucks.
What?

13:08.955 --> 13:11.089
I stole it from my brother.
He said it's priceless.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.258
Oh, it's hot.
Sorry, I'm not interested.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.294
Dude, what kind of weird,
honest pawn shop is this?

13:16.296 --> 13:19.197
The grown-up kind
that sells things
that grown-ups want...

13:19.199 --> 13:21.533
Like engagement rings
and guns.

13:21.535 --> 13:22.267
Come on. 10 bucks.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.702
Some nerd will pay
top dollar for this.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.137
Really?
No landing gear.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.206
The gun turret's cracked.
And no radar disc.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.842
How would this thing ever do
the kessel run in 12 parsecs?

13:30.844 --> 13:32.110
I don't know
what any of that
means, okay?

13:32.112 --> 13:34.379
Just give me a few quarters,
and I'll go away.

13:34.381 --> 13:37.215
<i>As barry pawned away</i>
<i>the last shred of his dignity,</i>

13:37.217 --> 13:40.485
<i>Erica's date</i>
<i>was really</i>
<i>starting to sizzle.</i>

13:40.487 --> 13:42.854
Would anyone
like a refill
on their soda?

13:42.856 --> 13:44.122
It's actually
my 21st birthday.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.857
So how about
mai tais
all around?

13:45.859 --> 13:49.227
Well, the balloon says
you're 17,
so how about no?

13:49.229 --> 13:50.528
Well, I'm not 17.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.665
Eight mai tais, please.
All for me.
It's been a tough week.

13:53.667 --> 13:57.535
Yeah, college is really hard
'cause he's in college.

13:58.103 --> 13:58.970
Now, who wants sake?

13:58.972 --> 14:00.471
No, thanks.
I don't drink.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.641
Whoa.
Who brought
the wet blanket?

14:03.643 --> 14:04.142
(laughing)

14:04.144 --> 14:07.745
No, I don't drink
when there's
a table of cops next to us.

14:07.747 --> 14:08.813
There's what now?

14:08.815 --> 14:10.648
I don't even know this girl,
all right?

14:10.650 --> 14:12.584
My dad
is her mom's podiatrist!

14:12.586 --> 14:14.085
The only reason
I agreed
to go out with her

14:14.087 --> 14:16.154
Is 'cause he said
I could use his saab!

14:16.156 --> 14:20.024
Well, that's
a real sob story,
am I right?

14:20.026 --> 14:20.892
(both laugh)

14:20.894 --> 14:22.927
You're such an ass,
drew.

14:24.129 --> 14:25.230
I love you.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.165
What?
Nothing.

14:29.401 --> 14:32.270
Adult adam:
<i>Meanwhile, at the arcade,</i>
<i>barry was jonesing</i>

14:32.272 --> 14:33.271
<i>To beat "punch-out!"</i>

14:33.273 --> 14:36.374
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>it was beating him.</i>

14:36.775 --> 14:39.277
Focus, barry! Focus!

14:39.345 --> 14:41.379
Beat it, lyle.
You're bad luck.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.313
(crowd cheering)

14:42.315 --> 14:45.216
<i>This was it...</i>
<i>The last quarter.</i>

14:45.218 --> 14:47.485
<i>One final shot at glory.</i>

14:47.487 --> 14:50.555
<i>What happened</i>
<i>next was legendary.</i>

14:50.557 --> 14:50.989
Yes! Yes!

14:50.991 --> 14:54.859
<i>That single quarter</i>
<i>lasted barry 20 minutes.</i>

14:54.861 --> 14:55.727
Go! Let's go!

14:55.729 --> 15:00.698
<i>He was a man possessed,</i>
<i>knocking out glass joe,</i>
<i>bald bull, pizza pasta.</i>

15:00.700 --> 15:03.301
<i>There was no one</i>
<i>who could take</i>
<i>my brother down.</i>

15:03.303 --> 15:06.571
Yes! Yes! Yes!
<i>No one except...</i>

15:06.573 --> 15:08.339
(machine powers down)

15:08.341 --> 15:09.607
No!

15:09.609 --> 15:11.175
<i>...Me.</i>

15:11.443 --> 15:12.110
What did you do?

15:12.112 --> 15:14.712
What did you do?
My millennium falcon's gone.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.348
Did you really think
I wouldn't notice?

15:17.350 --> 15:18.049
Kind of.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.083
Why didn't you sell
something of yours,

15:19.085 --> 15:20.418
Like your signed
moses malone jersey?

15:20.420 --> 15:23.021
Dude,
I could never sell that.
I'd miss it too much.

15:23.023 --> 15:27.125
You know what,
even with all
the crap you do,

15:27.127 --> 15:29.327
I still look up to you.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.829
Not anymore.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.098
Adam, wait.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.800
Adult adam:
<i>It was game over</i>
<i>for my brother.</i>

15:35.802 --> 15:40.038
<i>He'd hit rock bottom and</i>
<i>finally ran out of options...</i>

15:40.906 --> 15:43.041
<i>And quarters.</i>

15:43.309 --> 15:44.442
<i>After watching her date</i>
<i>get arrested,</i>

15:44.444 --> 15:46.911
<i>Erica had to call home</i>
<i>for a ride.</i>

15:46.913 --> 15:47.979
Murray: There you are.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.548
Your mom and I
couldn't decide

15:50.550 --> 15:52.917
Who you'd be more
annoyed to see.

15:52.919 --> 15:55.987
We talked about it
for a while,
and here I am.

15:55.989 --> 16:00.525
Good.
'cause I don't ever
want to talk to her again.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.827
Stupid,
beautiful podiatrist's son.

16:02.829 --> 16:05.330
Your mom means well.
Man: Hey!

16:05.332 --> 16:06.531
(grill sizzles)

16:06.533 --> 16:09.300
Um, we're not
gonna be eating
anything.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.369
Thank you. Yeah.

16:11.371 --> 16:11.970
But the thing is...

16:11.972 --> 16:14.405
If you're gonna say
another lame dad cliche,

16:14.407 --> 16:15.974
I will literally
press your face

16:15.976 --> 16:18.042
Against this hot,
sizzling grill.

16:18.044 --> 16:18.810
No, no, I believe you.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.045
But I really want you
to hear this.
Man: Hey! Hey!

16:21.047 --> 16:23.581
Hey, um, listen,
you don't understand.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.351
I'm trying
to talk to my...

16:26.353 --> 16:27.585
Is that shrimp?
Hey!

16:27.587 --> 16:29.487
All right, you know what,
I'd love some shrimp,

16:29.489 --> 16:31.689
But keep
the schtick down.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.291
So, when I was your age,

16:33.293 --> 16:36.427
My first girlfriend
dumped me out of the blue.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.430
I spent the whole summer
with the shades drawn,

16:39.432 --> 16:42.767
Eating zagnut bars,
and watching
old horror movies.

16:42.769 --> 16:46.037
I was miserable
and heartbroken.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.406
(imitating
heart pounding)

16:49.208 --> 16:50.675
Knock it off.

16:50.677 --> 16:54.312
The point is that
I know there's
no easy fix here,

16:54.314 --> 16:57.682
But all you need
is time.

16:57.684 --> 16:58.850
How much time?

16:58.852 --> 16:59.484
I don't know.

16:59.486 --> 17:03.488
But I promise you
that one day you're
gonna wake up,

17:03.490 --> 17:06.157
And it just
won't hurt as much.

17:06.725 --> 17:08.493
I hope so.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.395
Thanks, daddy.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.030
Really?
I helped you?

17:12.032 --> 17:13.998
Yeah, I am just
as surprised as you are.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.433
Well,
you're gonna be just fine.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.635
You are.
And just remember...

17:17.637 --> 17:20.104
It's getting kind of loud,
all right?

17:20.106 --> 17:21.806
It's still...
It's not, uh...

17:21.808 --> 17:23.374
I don't think
he understands.

17:23.376 --> 17:28.780
<i>Little did we know</i>
<i>erica wasn't the only</i>
<i>one ready to accept some help.</i>

17:29.281 --> 17:30.715
Hi.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.017
My name
is barry norman goldberg.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.252
I'm addicted to
arcade games.

17:34.254 --> 17:37.955
We don't want to hear it.
Hey, cut him some slack,
kiddo.

17:37.957 --> 17:41.893
The first step is admitting
you got a problem.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.494
And I think
I can help you.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.431
(huey lewis and the news'
<i>"the power of love"</i> plays)

17:46.433 --> 17:47.532
There you go.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.300
What the hell
is that for?

17:49.302 --> 17:51.903
You love that boxing game,
right?

17:51.905 --> 17:54.739
Why not try
the real thing?

17:55.174 --> 17:56.974
I don't know, pops.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.910
It's not the same.

17:58.912 --> 18:01.179
Save you a lot of quarters.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.781
Huh! Huh!

18:04.249 --> 18:06.651
(grunting)

18:10.089 --> 18:13.124
I certainly don't look
bad doing this.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.592
What happened?

18:14.594 --> 18:18.830
The trick with
any addiction is replacing it

18:18.832 --> 18:20.465
With a healthy alternative.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.933
Adult adam:
<i>That's the thing</i>
<i>about family.</i>

18:21.935 --> 18:24.969
<i>No matter what,</i>
<i>they're always there for you.</i>

18:24.971 --> 18:26.737
I know
this may sound crazy,

18:26.739 --> 18:29.674
But I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
become champion of the world.

18:29.676 --> 18:33.111
<i>Even when</i>
<i>you're at your worst.</i>

18:33.245 --> 18:37.181
Well, how'd it go?
Was she mad?
How mad was she?

18:37.183 --> 18:38.349
Does she hate her mama?

18:38.351 --> 18:42.019
Huh, relax. I think
she's starting to feel better.

18:42.087 --> 18:43.054
This feels right!

18:43.056 --> 18:46.457
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

18:46.459 --> 18:48.693
(laughs)

18:48.695 --> 18:50.695
Erica, stop.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.563
Really?
What?

18:52.565 --> 18:54.198
She's healing.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.300
What is going on?

18:56.302 --> 18:57.535
The wind!

18:57.537 --> 19:00.838
We'll write you a check.
We'll write you a check.

19:03.275 --> 19:05.776
Adult adam:
<i>Sometimes you need</i>
<i>them to bail you out.</i>

19:05.778 --> 19:08.146
<i>And sometimes you need them</i>
<i>to not say a thing.</i>

19:08.148 --> 19:10.948
<i>They just need to be there.</i>

19:16.188 --> 19:18.489
<i>Turns out</i>
<i>my dad was right.</i>

19:18.491 --> 19:19.290
(alarm blaring)

19:19.292 --> 19:20.625
<i>All erica</i>
<i>needed was a little time.</i>

19:20.627 --> 19:24.862
<i>One day,</i>
<i>she woke up and...</i>
<i>It just didn't hurt anymore.</i>

19:25.397 --> 19:28.466
<i>That's the great thing</i>
<i>about first loves.</i>

19:28.468 --> 19:29.133
<i>They're not the last.</i>

19:29.135 --> 19:33.137
<i>And just like that</i>
<i>the age of darkness</i>
<i>was over.</i>

19:33.139 --> 19:36.541
<i>As for barry, he went</i>
<i>from scrounging for change...</i>

19:36.543 --> 19:37.508
<i>...To making some changes.</i>

19:37.510 --> 19:39.577
I want to
buy that spaceship back.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.245
$50.
(groans)

19:41.247 --> 19:43.948
I was afraid
this might happen.

19:43.950 --> 19:48.619
How much will you give me
for this signed
moses malone jersey?

19:50.589 --> 19:53.658
My falcon!
You got it back?

19:53.660 --> 19:55.826
Dude! Get off me!

19:55.828 --> 19:57.395
If you touch
my torso again,

19:57.397 --> 20:00.798
I will smash your spaceship
with my hands.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.601
(imitating blasters firing)

20:07.372 --> 20:07.905
Hey, chewbacca!

20:07.907 --> 20:11.442
Yo, nerd!
Every rocky needs his mickey.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.377
Come train me.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.346
Come on.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.481
<i>Sure I got my</i>
<i>millennium falcon back,</i>

20:17.483 --> 20:20.184
<i>More barry was back</i>
<i>to being barry.</i>

20:20.186 --> 20:24.989
<i>And this game of "punch-out!"</i>
<i>beat every arcade in town.</i>

20:24.991 --> 20:27.058
Aah! Whoo!

20:29.461 --> 20:31.662
Man: I'm filming now.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.464
(dinging)

20:33.732 --> 20:36.133
The ultimate
in four-wheel drive.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.236
(dinging)

20:38.370 --> 20:39.937
(laughs)

20:41.173 --> 20:43.374
Ginny,
I think it's a good thing

20:43.376 --> 20:44.609
That drew and erica
didn't work out, you know?

20:44.611 --> 20:50.414
The last thing we need
is their relationship
to come between us, you know?

20:50.416 --> 20:51.015
Totally.

20:51.017 --> 20:54.318
Can I tell you something,
but you have to promise
not to tell another soul?

20:54.320 --> 20:56.654
I would never.
(sighs)

20:56.656 --> 20:57.488
Tracy kissed john martino.

20:57.490 --> 21:01.459
Drew is a mess,
and now he won't even
use his water-park pass.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.060
Oh, my god.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.829
So awful.

21:05.864 --> 21:08.566
Are you...
Are you walking faster?

21:08.568 --> 21:10.534
No, are you slowing down?

21:10.536 --> 21:13.771
Stop...
Stop picking up
the pace, bev.

21:13.773 --> 21:14.905
Stop it! (gasps)

21:14.907 --> 21:17.608
You are clearly
going to tell erica!

21:17.610 --> 21:20.411
I can't hear you.
You're too far behind.

21:20.413 --> 21:23.047
You're running!
You are running!

21:23.049 --> 21:24.282
Stop running!

21:24.284 --> 21:26.917
This is
just my natural gait.
