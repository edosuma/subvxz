00:01.392 --> 00:03.003
[Betty]
Previously onRiverdale...

00:03.046 --> 00:04.047
What were you doing in there?

00:04.091 --> 00:05.918
I was... praying.

00:05.962 --> 00:09.139
My team's been investigating
Edgar Evernever
for quite some time now.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.662
We had someone on the inside,

00:10.706 --> 00:12.664
someone tasked
with getting close to Edgar.

00:12.708 --> 00:15.319
[Betty] My mother
is an FBI informant?

00:15.363 --> 00:18.148
Charles, what if that means
she's been found out?

00:18.192 --> 00:20.324
You should go
to Stonewall Prep, Jug.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.022
Look me in the eye and tell me

00:22.065 --> 00:24.328
you don't want
to go to a school
that recognizes your talent.

00:24.372 --> 00:25.851
Hey, are you Forsythe?

00:25.895 --> 00:27.027
Yeah.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.767
Bret Weston Wallis.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.726
Mr. Chipping asked me
to roll out the red carpet.

00:30.769 --> 00:32.945
The Lodge name is... tainted.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.947
But my mother's
maiden name, Gomez?

00:34.991 --> 00:36.036
I think I could work with that.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.515
But I did see Edgar,

00:37.559 --> 00:38.951
and, Betty, he's armed.

00:38.995 --> 00:39.996
Edgar's digging in.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.042
He's getting ready for war.

00:46.611 --> 00:49.179
[Munroe] Sit your butt down
and don't move.

00:49.223 --> 00:50.746
[Malcolm] You need
to chill out, okay?

00:50.789 --> 00:51.747
Nothing happened!

00:53.401 --> 00:54.271
Everything all right, Munroe?

00:54.315 --> 00:55.664
Anything but.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.057
Malcolm's been hanging out
at the Wipeout Arcade.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.623
So?

00:58.667 --> 01:00.886
That place is crawling
with dealers and fiends

01:00.930 --> 01:02.323
and I don't want him
getting mixed up in that.

01:06.762 --> 01:09.547
Didn't we say
we were gonna turn this place
into a community center, Red?

01:09.591 --> 01:11.593
We are. I still plan on it.

01:11.941 --> 01:13.464
But...

01:13.508 --> 01:15.075
life kind of
threw me a curveball.

01:16.946 --> 01:17.947
But you're right,

01:18.948 --> 01:19.949
feels like it's time.

01:23.257 --> 01:24.345
[sighs]

01:25.607 --> 01:26.521
[Jellybean] Found it.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.091
[scoffs]

01:31.134 --> 01:33.658
Well, we are certainly
not in Riverdale High anymore.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.009
Welcome to
the Dead Poets Society.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.489
Not a bad coop, boy.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.106
Okay, kitten, let's go find
the vending machine

01:46.149 --> 01:47.977
and I'll buy you
some Triple Bubble.

01:51.023 --> 01:52.286
You still okay with this?

01:53.635 --> 01:54.462
Yeah.

01:55.811 --> 01:56.812
I'm just gonna miss you,

01:56.855 --> 01:58.596
that's all.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.946
Well, you better take
your breaks from me
while you can, Cooper.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.471
'Cause you and I are in this
for the long haul. Okay?

02:08.650 --> 02:09.477
[Veronica] I don't know
what happened.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.349
I thought I wanted
to sign the document

02:12.393 --> 02:14.873
and officially change my name
to Veronica Gomez,

02:14.917 --> 02:16.136
but...

02:16.179 --> 02:17.702
in the moment,
I just couldn't do it.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.965
Look, if it didn't feel right,
it didn't feel right.

02:20.009 --> 02:22.316
I still want to do it.

02:22.359 --> 02:24.840
I just need to figure out
who I'm going to be.

02:24.883 --> 02:26.537
And you will.

02:26.581 --> 02:28.191
In the meantime,
you want to go
with me to the gym?

02:28.235 --> 02:29.540
I'm meeting with Ms. Weiss

02:29.584 --> 02:31.063
about turning the place
into a community center.

02:31.107 --> 02:31.934
Of course.

02:32.674 --> 02:34.154
Do we need to leave now?

02:36.330 --> 02:37.679
I mean, we've got some time.

02:48.516 --> 02:49.343
Jughead?

02:51.040 --> 02:52.998
Moose. [EXCLAIMS]

02:53.042 --> 02:54.217
What the hell?

02:55.087 --> 02:56.654
It's good to see you.

02:56.698 --> 02:58.482
Actually, it's, uh...

02:58.526 --> 02:59.570
It's Marmaduke now.

03:00.267 --> 03:01.703
Marmaduke?

03:01.746 --> 03:03.705
Wait, are you my roommate?

03:03.748 --> 03:05.054
What are you doing here, dude?

03:06.708 --> 03:08.710
After my dad was arrested
for impersonating the...

03:09.711 --> 03:11.016
Gargoyle King,

03:11.060 --> 03:12.061
it, uh...

03:12.888 --> 03:14.716
kind of blew up my life...

03:14.759 --> 03:15.891
my family...

03:15.934 --> 03:16.979
everything.

03:17.022 --> 03:20.330
I... kind of had
a nervous breakdown.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.376
I even ended up
in a facility
for a couple of months.

03:22.419 --> 03:23.333
Aw, man.

03:23.377 --> 03:24.639
When I got out, we decided

03:24.682 --> 03:26.423
it would be better
if I started someplace new,

03:26.467 --> 03:27.685
someplace fresh.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.339
So took a year off

03:29.383 --> 03:31.559
and I came here
to play football
and start over.

03:31.602 --> 03:33.343
Well, are you feeling
any better?

03:33.387 --> 03:34.736
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I...

03:34.779 --> 03:37.042
You know, I feel like
a person again.

03:37.086 --> 03:40.785
Like this...
this darkness is off me.

03:40.829 --> 03:43.919
But, please just keep this
between us, Okay?

03:43.962 --> 03:45.312
If some of these guys
got a whiff...

03:46.008 --> 03:46.878
of who I was...

03:46.922 --> 03:48.228
No.

03:48.271 --> 03:50.578
Your secret is safe with me,
Marmaduke.

03:50.621 --> 03:52.275
Thanks, man.

03:52.319 --> 03:55.060
And we'll need to be especially
tight-lipped around Bret.

03:55.104 --> 03:55.931
You rang?

03:57.802 --> 03:58.934
Forsythe, welcome.

03:58.977 --> 04:00.152
Lovely to see you again.

04:00.196 --> 04:01.066
Yeah, and you too.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.024
I see you've met our roommate.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.026
Ah, yeah. Marmaduke and I

04:04.069 --> 04:05.375
were actually
just getting acquainted.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.551
Well, it's about time
for seminar.

04:07.595 --> 04:08.813
Did you do the reading?

04:10.946 --> 04:12.339
Munroe and I
will group the kids

04:12.382 --> 04:14.558
for boxing and MMA lessons
according to their age.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.168
We'll keep the gym open
until 10:00,

04:16.212 --> 04:18.258
so kids like my brother
have a place to hang
after school

04:18.301 --> 04:20.085
and keep them off the streets
before they go home.

04:20.129 --> 04:21.783
Oh, that all sounds wonderful.

04:21.826 --> 04:23.001
I just want you to be aware

04:23.045 --> 04:24.786
of how much work
this will actually entail.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.004
And what about school, Archie?

04:26.048 --> 04:27.267
Mr. Keller will be here
during the day.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.269
Archie, when was the last time

04:29.312 --> 04:31.140
the gym had
a safety inspection?

04:31.183 --> 04:33.098
If this really is going to be
a community center,

04:33.142 --> 04:34.839
there are updates
you'll have to do.

04:34.883 --> 04:36.667
At minimum,
adding a second bathroom.

04:36.711 --> 04:37.886
Oh, that sounds expensive.

04:38.626 --> 04:39.975
We'll figure it out, Mom.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.107
[Charles] You're just in time.

04:42.151 --> 04:44.632
Thanks to your friend
Kevin's intel,

04:44.675 --> 04:47.417
I've had this derelict motel
under 24-hour surveillance.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.158
According to city records,

04:49.201 --> 04:50.551
it's owned by
one of Edgar's followers.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.640
And...

04:52.683 --> 04:54.206
look who's answering
the front door.

04:55.817 --> 04:57.209
Great.

04:57.253 --> 04:58.820
If we know they are,
then what are we waiting for?

04:58.863 --> 05:00.082
Have you ever heard
of Waco, Betty?

05:00.691 --> 05:01.649
Charles?

05:02.389 --> 05:03.303
Check this out.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.218
Farm's been getting
pizza deliveries every day

05:06.262 --> 05:07.176
about the same time.

05:07.219 --> 05:08.351
We've got an agent in disguise

05:08.395 --> 05:09.961
about to make a delivery
as we speak.

05:10.005 --> 05:10.962
[static over phone]

05:11.006 --> 05:12.050
[knocking at door on phone]

05:13.878 --> 05:15.358
[female Farmie on phone]
Yeah? Who are you?

05:15.402 --> 05:16.794
[FBI agent]
Sorry, I got lost.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.188
Pizza delivery.
10 cheese, 10 pepperoni.

[Farmie]
You're not our guy.

-[Farmie] Here we go. Come on.

05:27.109 --> 05:28.284
[gunshots]

05:29.938 --> 05:31.331
Echo, this is Charlie,
do you read me?

05:32.070 --> 05:34.029
Echo, do you read me?

05:34.072 --> 05:36.031
[Edgar on radio]
Charles, is that you?

05:36.074 --> 05:37.815
Sending someone in with a wire?

05:37.859 --> 05:40.165
You're usually
more clever than that.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.384
I know all your secrets.

05:42.254 --> 05:44.648
Don't send anyone else in

05:44.692 --> 05:47.564
or their blood
will also be on your hands.

05:49.523 --> 05:50.393
Wait to hear from me.

05:59.141 --> 06:00.838
[spooky creaking]

06:00.882 --> 06:02.013
[sighs]

06:02.057 --> 06:04.538
[sighs] There goes
your Nana Rose again.

06:05.756 --> 06:07.192
I swear, it's like every night.

06:07.236 --> 06:09.369
It's like she's scratching
inside the walls.

06:09.412 --> 06:13.068
[sighs] Nana Rose
is a restless spirit.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.243
[rumbling]

06:14.286 --> 06:16.027
Babe...

06:16.071 --> 06:18.290
it worries me leaving
the twins alone with her

06:18.334 --> 06:20.292
while we're at school.

06:20.336 --> 06:21.990
Maybe we should hire
caretaker for her.

06:23.121 --> 06:24.949
And have a stranger
living amongst us,

06:24.993 --> 06:26.690
sticking their noses
into our business?

06:26.734 --> 06:27.778
Absolutely not.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.694
We're all doing just fine.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.175
[bloodcurdling scream]

06:49.757 --> 06:50.627

06:52.455 --> 06:53.282
Nana?

06:56.807 --> 06:57.678
Are you okay?

07:00.811 --> 07:02.160
[gasps] Oh, Penelope.

07:02.204 --> 07:03.205
There you are.

07:03.988 --> 07:05.207
Thank heavens...

07:06.469 --> 07:09.907
[whispering] I thought
I saw the triplets...

07:09.951 --> 07:11.605
burning in the fire.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.131
Nana...

07:16.174 --> 07:17.045
it's me,

07:19.787 --> 07:21.963
And Juniper and Dagwood,

07:22.790 --> 07:24.618
the twins,

07:24.661 --> 07:26.968
are sleeping soundly
in the nursery.

07:39.023 --> 07:40.590
I'm looking at around 40 grand

07:40.634 --> 07:42.592
to pay for the renovations
that the gym needs.

07:42.636 --> 07:43.811
I hate to say it, again,

07:43.854 --> 07:46.030
but I could just
lend you the money.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.511
No, Ronnie,
I don't want to take
any more handouts.

07:48.555 --> 07:49.904
I want to work for it.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.819
I just need to figure out
what that work can be.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.385
We could host
a charity concert.

07:53.429 --> 07:54.648
Could have a bake sale?

07:54.691 --> 07:56.824
You'd have to sell
a lot of cupcakes.

07:56.867 --> 07:57.825
[Veronica] Now, hold on,

07:57.868 --> 07:59.783
I think Bee's
onto something.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.698
Not a bake sale, per se,

08:03.265 --> 08:06.224
but, looking at you
four strapping young men,

08:06.268 --> 08:07.878
there is another
classic way

[cell phone ringing]

09:25.477 --> 09:26.696
Oh, my God, Mom.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.089
I was so worried.

09:28.132 --> 09:29.743
[Edgar on phone]
No, Betty,

09:29.786 --> 09:30.787
it's me.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.049
Edgar.

09:32.093 --> 09:33.485
How did you get
my mom's phone?

09:33.529 --> 09:35.313
[Edgar laughs wickedly]

09:35.357 --> 09:37.925
I suspected we had a
pretender in our midst.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.144
When I... [sniffs]

09:40.188 --> 09:41.711
started cutting
people's fingers off,

09:41.755 --> 09:43.321
your mother admitted to me
it was her.

09:44.627 --> 09:45.628
I have a list of demands.

09:47.282 --> 09:48.631
[inhales] I'm listening.

09:49.284 --> 09:52.330
I need $250,000,

09:52.374 --> 09:54.071
passports for
all each and every one

09:54.115 --> 09:55.638
of my followers,

09:55.682 --> 09:57.161
food, water,

09:57.858 --> 09:59.294
and a bus

09:59.337 --> 10:00.338
for transport.

10:01.209 --> 10:02.253
Why did you call me?

10:02.297 --> 10:03.994
Why didn't you call Charles?

10:04.038 --> 10:05.996
Because I think you'll have
a better chance convincing him

10:06.040 --> 10:06.867
than I will.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.306
You have five hours.

10:14.875 --> 10:15.702
[sighs]

10:19.967 --> 10:21.359
[breathes heavily]

10:21.403 --> 10:24.667
Charles,
I just heard from Edgar.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.843
"My mother has asked me
to help her with the turkey,

10:27.801 --> 10:29.541
and I wonder, vaguely,

10:30.499 --> 10:31.543
when she'll die."

10:32.544 --> 10:33.937
Discussion is open.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.026
What is everyone's take
on Bret's story?

10:36.548 --> 10:37.419
In a word...

10:38.376 --> 10:39.203
astonishing.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.553
[Jonathan] Yeah, agreed.

10:41.597 --> 10:42.685
It's brilliant.

10:42.729 --> 10:43.599
Thank you, Jonathan.

10:45.862 --> 10:46.820
What did you think, roomie?

10:47.734 --> 10:48.996
Yeah, it was good.

10:49.039 --> 10:50.519
It was good? [chuckles]

10:50.562 --> 10:52.129
We've got a real
Harold Bloom here.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.261
Don't hold back, Jones.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.002
I'm a... I'm a big boy.
I can take it.

10:55.045 --> 10:55.872
[chuckles]

10:58.701 --> 10:59.528
To be honest...

11:00.703 --> 11:02.009
it wasn't really my taste.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.663
I thought it was, uh...

11:03.706 --> 11:04.881
Salinger-derivative.

11:06.883 --> 11:09.973
Thank you for that
constructive criticism,
Forsythe.

11:10.017 --> 11:11.888
You'd mind if I give you
my thoughts on your story?

11:11.932 --> 11:13.324
What was it?
The Gremlin King?

11:13.368 --> 11:14.238
The Gargoyle King.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.718
I thought it was a puerile,

11:15.762 --> 11:17.589
tawdry waste of time.
I mean... [chuckles]

11:17.633 --> 11:18.547
it's pulp.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.896
Pulp is not an insult to me.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.985
Not to mention,
your prose reads more like

11:22.029 --> 11:24.684
a pre-teen journaling
about his abandonment issues

11:24.727 --> 11:25.772
than as a
coherent narrative--

11:25.815 --> 11:27.730
Hey, hey, hey,
keep it clean, guys.

11:28.209 --> 11:29.210
Taste aside,

11:29.253 --> 11:31.168
all good writing does have

11:31.212 --> 11:32.474
one thing in common...

11:33.605 --> 11:35.390
Authenticity.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.044
That's my problem, then.

11:37.087 --> 11:39.524
I can't relate
to Jughead's work

11:39.568 --> 11:41.744
because I'm not from his world.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.878
I don't have any experience
with lowlives, or criminals,

11:44.921 --> 11:46.053
or trailer trash.

11:46.096 --> 11:47.576
Oh, no?

11:47.619 --> 11:48.838
I could give you
the crash course
in about five seconds.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.057
Jughead,

11:50.100 --> 11:52.102
there is a zero-tolerance
violence policy

11:52.146 --> 11:53.538
at Stonewall Prep.

11:53.582 --> 11:54.496
Do you hear me?

11:56.106 --> 11:58.239
Nana? Babies? I'm home.

12:01.285 --> 12:04.419
And who, pray tell, are you,

12:04.462 --> 12:05.768
interloper?

12:05.812 --> 12:07.770
[chuckles] Hello,
you must be Cheryl.

12:08.423 --> 12:09.598
Hey.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.861
Babe, don't get mad,
but this is Darius.

12:11.905 --> 12:14.211
He's a night nurse
I found online.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.431
I thought he could help
with Nana and the kids.

12:16.474 --> 12:17.562
[Cheryl] Fine.

12:17.606 --> 12:18.955
But you will do as you're told,

12:19.651 --> 12:20.914
nothing less,

12:20.957 --> 12:21.958
nothing more.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.832
You may tend to Nana
where she is,

12:26.658 --> 12:27.790
but you are not,

12:28.312 --> 12:30.401
repeat, not...

12:30.445 --> 12:32.142
to go into the Blossom Chapel
in the basement.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.189
It is forbidden.

12:36.494 --> 12:37.887
Sacred.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.628
Don't sweat it, Dee,

12:39.671 --> 12:40.977
not even I'm allowed
to go in there.

12:42.152 --> 12:43.675
Do we understand
each other, Darius?

12:44.328 --> 12:45.939
Absolutely, Miss Cheryl.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.339
Dude, there's
a tie on the door.

12:55.383 --> 12:57.864
I'm... I'm just not
used to this. I'm sorry.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.000
Donna?

13:06.481 --> 13:09.005
I'm sorry. Look,
I'm not one for gossip, so...

13:09.049 --> 13:10.311
I don't care if you are.

13:10.354 --> 13:11.834
I'm not ashamed
of anything I do.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.011
But, a word of advice, newbie?

13:16.491 --> 13:17.579
I'd watch your back
around Bret.

13:18.536 --> 13:19.929
Why? What is his deal?

13:19.973 --> 13:21.017
He's a diplo-brat.

13:22.149 --> 13:23.585
Son of a diplomat.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.935
Thinks that gives him immunity
to do whatever he wants.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.328
Like, beat me up?

13:27.371 --> 13:28.677
That's not how Bret fights.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.680
Okay. It's psychological
with him.

13:31.723 --> 13:34.117
And he's not afraid
to play dirty.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.076
Okay.
I'll take your advice.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.035
Bye, Marmaduke.

13:39.906 --> 13:40.820
Catch you later.

13:45.912 --> 13:46.782
I'm sorry.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.960
Look, I thought you were...

13:51.004 --> 13:52.222
I like guys and girls.

13:52.875 --> 13:53.876
-Cool?
-Yeah.

13:54.616 --> 13:55.835
Totally. I'll...

13:57.097 --> 13:58.228
keep an eye
on the doorknob.

14:01.623 --> 14:02.537
What happened?

14:02.580 --> 14:03.843
What did Governor Dooley say?

14:03.886 --> 14:05.192
The same thing
that he's been saying.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.889
That we can't give Edgar
what he demands

14:06.933 --> 14:08.760
and he will not negotiate
with a cult leader.

14:08.804 --> 14:09.761
Is he kidding?

14:09.805 --> 14:11.981
What about Mom and Polly

14:12.025 --> 14:13.461
and all of the other Farmies?

14:14.288 --> 14:15.550
[cell phone vibrates]

14:16.943 --> 14:18.683
[nervously] It's Edgar.
What do I say?

14:18.727 --> 14:20.250
You need to buy us time.

14:20.294 --> 14:21.469
Okay? I'll walk you through it.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.037
Hello?

14:24.080 --> 14:25.212
Hello, Betty.

14:25.255 --> 14:27.779
Did you get what I asked for?

14:27.823 --> 14:29.259
[whispers]
We're unable to meet
any demands

14:29.303 --> 14:31.609
unless he releases a hostage
as a sign of goodwill.

14:33.263 --> 14:36.527
They want you to release
a hostage first, Edgar,

14:36.571 --> 14:37.920
as a sign of good faith.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.574
[Edgar] Betty, Betty, Betty...

14:39.617 --> 14:41.358
I thought you would be
smarter than this.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.012
Working with people
who don't share

14:43.056 --> 14:45.449
your same interests
is a bad idea.

14:46.146 --> 14:47.582
At any rate,

14:47.625 --> 14:49.410
anticipating that
you and your partners

14:49.453 --> 14:50.933
wouldn't take
my demands seriously,

14:50.977 --> 14:52.630
I've already released
a hostage.

14:53.631 --> 14:54.545
What?

14:54.589 --> 14:55.938
-But--
-[phone disconnects]

14:55.982 --> 14:56.939
What the hell
is he talking about?

14:56.983 --> 14:57.897
What... What hostage?

14:58.288 --> 14:59.333
Betty?

15:00.464 --> 15:01.596
Polly?

15:01.639 --> 15:02.945
[scared] No. Stop!

15:02.989 --> 15:04.251
[timer ticking]

15:04.294 --> 15:05.121
Oh, my God!

15:08.255 --> 15:09.821
Polly, stay calm.
We're going to figure it out,
okay?

15:09.865 --> 15:11.911
-Tell him to stay back.
-Charles, please. Stay back.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.216
[crying] Please. Please.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.565
[Charles] She's holding
a dead man's switch.

15:14.609 --> 15:16.306
If she lets go,
the bomb explodes.

15:16.350 --> 15:17.612
Okay...

15:17.655 --> 15:18.918
Uh, all right, Polly,
I know Edgar must have

15:18.961 --> 15:20.006
said something to you, okay?

15:20.049 --> 15:21.268
But it doesn't...
It doesn't matter.

15:21.311 --> 15:22.791
I know you don't
want to do this.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.749
I know you don't want
Juniper and Dagwood

15:24.793 --> 15:26.273
to grow up without a mom,

15:26.316 --> 15:28.144
or me without a sister, okay?

15:28.188 --> 15:29.929
So, we're gonna
figure it out, okay?

15:29.972 --> 15:31.278
Okay. What are we gonna...

15:31.321 --> 15:32.670
Betty, look at the timer.

15:32.714 --> 15:34.324
There's wires connected
to the C4.

15:34.368 --> 15:35.760
Three of those are decoys.

15:35.804 --> 15:36.936
They'll trigger the detonator.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.502
You need to find
the one that's linked

15:38.546 --> 15:40.635
-to the firing circuit
and the battery.
-And the battery.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.463
Can I come up
and check, Polly?

15:42.506 --> 15:43.594
-[softly] Yeah.
-Okay, okay.

15:43.638 --> 15:44.856
Um...

15:44.900 --> 15:47.163
The firing circuit
and the battery.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.426
-[Polly whimpering]
-Firing circuit, battery.

15:49.470 --> 15:50.819
Uh... it's the yellow...
It's the yellow one.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.429
-It's the yellow.
-Here, take these.

15:52.473 --> 15:54.127
-So I have to... Okay.
-[Charles] Yeah.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.737
[panting] Careful.

15:55.780 --> 15:56.564
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.
It's fine.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.131
[whimpering]

15:58.174 --> 15:59.349
It's going to be okay. Okay?

16:00.481 --> 16:01.351
[timer beeps]

16:02.309 --> 16:03.353
It's counting down even faster.

16:03.397 --> 16:04.876
It's a tripwire.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.443
There may be a system override
on the dead man's switch.

16:06.487 --> 16:08.489
A pin connected to a chain,
that slides beneath a hole.

16:08.532 --> 16:09.794
It goes underneath the trigger.

16:09.838 --> 16:10.708
Polly, where's the pin?

16:10.752 --> 16:11.971
Edgar took it.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.798
-Took the pin.
-Everybody, get down. Betty!

16:13.842 --> 16:16.105
What am I doing?
The detonator needs a pin.
Needs a pin. Needs a pin.

16:16.149 --> 16:17.672
[Polly] No! No!
[Charles] Betty! Come on.

16:19.587 --> 16:20.501
[clicks]

16:21.676 --> 16:22.503
[beeps]

16:23.025 --> 16:23.983
Oh...

16:25.071 --> 16:26.681
[breathing heavily] It worked.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.162
It's okay.

16:31.686 --> 16:34.254
Scholars, I'm cancelling
this afternoon's seminar.

16:35.733 --> 16:39.041
Instead, we will be having
an evening session.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.522
You've each been given a copy
of the same mystery story,

16:41.565 --> 16:43.045
with the final chapter omitted,

16:43.089 --> 16:44.916
in which
the murderer's identity

16:44.960 --> 16:45.874
would be revealed.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.617
You're each to write
your own version of the ending,

16:50.574 --> 16:52.707
in whatever style you choose.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.056
We'll then
read all the endings,

16:54.100 --> 16:55.405
and decide the winner

16:56.058 --> 16:56.928
by a vote.

16:56.972 --> 16:57.886
Best story wins?

16:58.713 --> 17:00.149
Challenge accepted.

17:00.193 --> 17:01.498
What exactly will this

17:01.542 --> 17:04.197
so-called exercise
prove, Mr. Chipping?

17:04.240 --> 17:06.025
That there is no single way

17:06.068 --> 17:07.939
to tell a story, Donna.

17:09.550 --> 17:10.464
So...

17:11.421 --> 17:13.206
see you back here
by 9:00 p.m.

17:15.599 --> 17:16.426
Don't be late.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.217
[Munroe] Red! We gotta go.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.696
We gotta get these guys, now!

17:25.740 --> 17:26.871
What are you talking about?

17:26.915 --> 17:29.526
Malcolm...
got jumped by some thugs

17:29.570 --> 17:30.745
for not making deliveries.

17:30.788 --> 17:32.225
He wasn't even
hanging at the arcade.

17:32.268 --> 17:33.704
He listened to me,
and he still got hurt, Red.

17:33.748 --> 17:34.575
Is he going to be okay?

17:35.750 --> 17:36.707
He's a tough kid.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.361
He's seen worse.

17:38.405 --> 17:39.362
Malcolm said that
the thugs work

17:39.406 --> 17:40.885
for some guy named Dodger.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.235
He recruits kids
from the arcade,

17:42.278 --> 17:44.411
gets them to break into houses,
make deliveries,

17:44.454 --> 17:45.934
jack cars...
All kinds of crap.

17:45.977 --> 17:48.110
Riverdale's no place for people
that prey on kids,

17:48.154 --> 17:49.459
so let's teach them a lesson.

17:49.503 --> 17:50.895
Me and you.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.462
Let's go down there,
like old times.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.769
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

17:54.812 --> 17:56.945
If you get caught,
you might end up behind bars.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.599
And you got your brother
and your grandma

17:58.642 --> 17:59.600
depending on you now.

18:00.818 --> 18:02.255
I'll talk to FP,

18:02.298 --> 18:04.126
put this Dodger guy
on his radar,

18:04.170 --> 18:05.432
and we'll let the cops
take care of it.

18:06.302 --> 18:07.651
But this place,

18:07.695 --> 18:09.000
this is how we're going to
help Riverdale.

18:10.959 --> 18:14.093
Polly, you have to help us
stop Edgar.

18:14.136 --> 18:15.529
There is no stopping Edgar.

18:16.486 --> 18:17.748
You just...

18:17.792 --> 18:19.098
have to do what he says.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.143
Governor Dooley isn't
letting Charles

18:21.187 --> 18:23.232
or the FBI negotiate
with him.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.147
Then just do it yourself.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.975
Just get him
what he's asking for.

18:27.541 --> 18:28.933
Or what?

18:28.977 --> 18:31.632
Or he'll start sacrificing
his followers one by one.

18:31.675 --> 18:32.981
What about Mom?

18:33.024 --> 18:34.374
Where is she?
Is she okay?

18:35.375 --> 18:36.637
If she's still alive,

18:37.507 --> 18:38.508
it won't be for long.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.121
Unless you do what Edgar says.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.821
I don't think
I can get that much, Bee.

18:46.864 --> 18:50.607
$250,000 is a lot
to come up with.

18:50.651 --> 18:51.782
I'm sorry, Vee.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.697
I know that this is
an insane ask,

18:54.568 --> 18:56.135
but I can't say anything more

18:56.178 --> 18:57.745
except that
there are lives at stake.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.184
It doesn't need to be cash,
does it?

19:06.232 --> 19:09.496
Those Glamourge eggs,
they're worth $50,000 each.

19:10.845 --> 19:11.976
That should do it.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.500
Oh, my God, Vee. Really?

19:13.543 --> 19:15.066
Aren't those your dad's?

19:15.110 --> 19:16.155
My mom's, actually.

19:16.938 --> 19:17.765
Take 'em.

19:19.375 --> 19:20.855
But...

19:20.898 --> 19:22.030
How are you going to get
the other stuff?

19:23.901 --> 19:25.033
I know people.

19:26.861 --> 19:28.210
What do you think? [sighs]

19:28.254 --> 19:30.647
You need fake passports
for all these people?

19:30.691 --> 19:31.561
They don't need to be fake.

19:31.605 --> 19:32.693
Blank passports are fine.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.477
They'll do everything else.

19:34.521 --> 19:35.652
I really can't get into it,

19:35.696 --> 19:37.045
but it's a matter
of life or death.

19:38.046 --> 19:38.873
Okay.

19:39.917 --> 19:40.744
I know a guy.

19:41.919 --> 19:42.746
Thank you, Toni.

19:46.533 --> 19:48.056
Ms. Cooper.

19:48.099 --> 19:49.231
What is the emergency?

19:49.275 --> 19:50.711
I'm sorry to bother you,
Ms. Bell,

19:50.754 --> 19:53.714
but I left my calculus book
on the bus this morning.

19:53.757 --> 19:55.498
I'm sorry, dear,

19:55.542 --> 19:57.370
but you'll have to
pick it up tomorrow.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.154
Mr. Fritz has already left
for the day.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.330
Oh, geez.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.202
Well, if he's already gone...

20:07.423 --> 20:08.555
[cell phone ringing]

20:09.643 --> 20:11.340
[Edgar on phone]
Yes, Betty?

20:11.384 --> 20:13.081
I got everything you asked for.

20:13.951 --> 20:15.126
Let me in.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.911
Well done.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.042
I'll see you outside.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.392
[cell phone disconnects]

20:47.289 --> 20:49.465
At last, we meet again.

20:50.205 --> 20:51.467
[laughs]

20:52.947 --> 20:55.602
I got everything
that you asked for.

20:55.645 --> 20:58.692
Money, passports, food, water,
it's all in the bus.

21:00.650 --> 21:01.956
Now where's my mom?

21:02.609 --> 21:03.436
Mmm...

21:04.132 --> 21:04.959
[grunts]

21:05.002 --> 21:06.308
I knew you wouldn't fail me.

21:08.484 --> 21:09.616
Oh...

21:09.659 --> 21:12.401
Betty. It is such a shame

21:12.445 --> 21:14.621
that you didn't accept
the simple truths

21:14.664 --> 21:15.970
I tried to instill in you...

21:16.013 --> 21:17.928
Edgar. Where is my mom?

21:17.972 --> 21:21.192
...because without
those truths...

21:22.498 --> 21:23.456
Betty,

21:24.544 --> 21:26.023
all you're left with...

21:29.462 --> 21:30.332
is pain.

21:31.202 --> 21:32.203
[grunts]

21:36.338 --> 21:37.208
Nighty-night.

21:37.644 --> 21:38.514
[laughs]

21:49.177 --> 21:50.526
[keyboard clacking]

21:57.228 --> 21:58.447
Could you knock it off?

21:58.491 --> 22:00.231
Sorry, am I distracting you
from your genius?

22:02.059 --> 22:03.452
Hey, Forsythe,

22:03.496 --> 22:05.324
I was wondering, is it common

22:06.237 --> 22:07.326
for gangs...

22:09.023 --> 22:10.677
to have a writer
among its ranks?

22:10.720 --> 22:12.156
I mean, I suppose

22:12.200 --> 22:13.897
a kid like you
needed something

22:14.594 --> 22:16.378
to call a family.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.162
After all, weren't you
just a little urchin

22:18.206 --> 22:20.382
wandering the streets
after your mom ditched you

22:20.426 --> 22:22.384
and your good-for-nothing
drunk of a father?

22:22.428 --> 22:23.559
And, come to think of it,

22:24.386 --> 22:25.909
isn't your little sister

22:25.953 --> 22:28.259
a budding hooligan herself?

22:29.304 --> 22:30.653
Only 13 years old,

22:30.697 --> 22:33.221
and already roped into
your mom's drug business.

22:35.223 --> 22:36.224
You're right.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.095
I wasn't born in rarified air.

22:38.139 --> 22:39.532
I didn't grow up
with any silver spoons.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.012
But my dad

22:42.056 --> 22:44.188
had the strength
to turn his life around

22:44.232 --> 22:45.929
and become a sheriff.

22:45.973 --> 22:47.496
And I have friends,

22:47.540 --> 22:50.673
and family that
actually care for me.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.066
Can you even say the same?

22:54.285 --> 22:57.332
So why don't you try writing
a compelling drama,

22:59.116 --> 23:00.248
instead of starting it?

23:16.264 --> 23:17.308
Smithers?

23:28.494 --> 23:29.320
Daddy?

23:32.280 --> 23:33.803
You're supposed to be in jail.

23:33.847 --> 23:36.719
Mija,I own that jail.

23:36.763 --> 23:37.851
I come and go as I please.

23:39.026 --> 23:40.941
I heard a nasty little rumor

23:40.984 --> 23:42.769
that you were dropping
the Lodge name.

23:45.815 --> 23:47.643
I've never taken
the trash out, Daddy,

23:49.166 --> 23:50.472
but I know
when something's rotten.

23:52.474 --> 23:54.171
That name is mud,

23:54.215 --> 23:55.303
and I'm done with it.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.482
Do you know
who Jaime Luna was?

24:02.136 --> 24:03.224
Doesn't ring a bell.

24:03.267 --> 24:05.139
Yeah, well, Luna was
my father's name,

24:05.182 --> 24:06.532
And Jaime Luna

24:07.489 --> 24:09.186
was the name of his only son.

24:11.493 --> 24:12.363
Me.

24:14.409 --> 24:15.802
I wasn't born Hiram Lodge.

24:17.978 --> 24:18.848
I became him.

24:20.023 --> 24:21.764
You have no idea
what it was like

24:21.808 --> 24:24.158
to be a Luna
in a town like Riverdale.

24:24.201 --> 24:27.509
Everyone looked down on us
because of that name.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.642
So, I took a name
that people would respect.

24:30.860 --> 24:31.818
Lodge.

24:33.384 --> 24:34.560
And when my father found out,

24:37.171 --> 24:38.346
he was angry,

24:40.348 --> 24:41.392
and he beat me.

24:42.655 --> 24:43.960
And I didn't understand it,

24:44.004 --> 24:46.180
because I didn't want his life,
I wanted mine,

24:46.223 --> 24:47.137
my own name.

24:47.181 --> 24:48.008
What was the big deal?

24:50.184 --> 24:51.228
Well, mija,

24:51.272 --> 24:52.534
[sighs]

24:53.579 --> 24:54.580
it is now...

24:56.016 --> 24:57.539
in this very moment

24:57.583 --> 25:00.237
that I understand
my father's rage.

25:01.412 --> 25:03.023
Do you think

25:03.066 --> 25:05.939
that changing your name
is going to
wash away your sins?

25:06.679 --> 25:07.549
It won't.

25:11.031 --> 25:13.512
I'm not going down
the same path
as you did, Daddy.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.514
You keep telling yourself that

25:15.557 --> 25:17.037
because you will always be
part of this family.

25:17.777 --> 25:18.865
It's in your blood.

25:19.387 --> 25:20.257
And that...

25:21.781 --> 25:22.869
doesn't wash out.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.222
Don't bother
changing the locks.

25:29.092 --> 25:30.050
You can't keep me out.

25:40.800 --> 25:41.801
Hey, can we talk?

25:43.063 --> 25:43.890
Sure. What's up?

25:45.239 --> 25:47.284
I want you to come back
to Chicago with me.

25:48.329 --> 25:49.460
Mom...

25:49.504 --> 25:50.853
You can finish
your senior year there.

25:50.897 --> 25:52.028
You can start again.

25:52.072 --> 25:53.421
I don't want to start again.

25:53.464 --> 25:54.683
And my best bet
at going to college

25:54.727 --> 25:56.685
is on a football scholarship.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.731
Otherwise, how would I
even be able to afford college?

26:00.950 --> 26:03.257
Your father and I
started a fund for you
when you were born.

26:04.475 --> 26:05.694
What?

26:05.738 --> 26:07.043
A fund? I have money?

26:07.087 --> 26:08.958
I was reluctant to tell you

26:09.002 --> 26:11.439
because I thought that
you would want to use it
on the community center.

26:11.482 --> 26:12.875
Of course I would.

26:12.919 --> 26:15.704
[sighs]
Archie, as noble an idea
as that may be,

26:15.748 --> 26:17.184
do you really think

26:17.227 --> 26:19.403
that's going to make
a difference here in Riverdale?

26:19.447 --> 26:21.449
I mean, all the crime here,

26:21.492 --> 26:23.277
your friend
Munroe's little brother

26:23.320 --> 26:25.235
beaten up by a bunch of thugs?

26:25.279 --> 26:27.934
Is that really the town
that you want to invest in?

26:27.977 --> 26:29.892
No one is safe here.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.720
Look. I'm not going to give up

26:31.764 --> 26:33.243
on Riverdale
the same way you did.

26:33.287 --> 26:34.636
I moved to Chicago

26:34.680 --> 26:36.595
because I couldn't find
a job here.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.119
And don't blame me
if I am trying to stop my child

26:39.162 --> 26:41.817
from putting his money
into a losing proposition.

26:41.861 --> 26:44.298
Yeah. Well, I guess
that's the difference
between you and me, Mom.

26:46.039 --> 26:48.215
I don't think Riverdale
is a losing proposition.

26:48.955 --> 26:49.782
The same as Dad.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.132
I'm not moving.

26:52.175 --> 26:53.873
And I will
make a difference here.

27:01.184 --> 27:02.577
[panting]

27:26.209 --> 27:28.647
[video games beeping
in distance]

27:49.189 --> 27:51.408
All right, if we're gonna
do this, we got to
do it right. Okay?

27:51.452 --> 27:52.671
-You guys follow my orders--
-Hey...

27:55.108 --> 27:56.500
You Dodger?

27:56.544 --> 27:58.241
That ain't your business.

28:01.027 --> 28:01.854
Yeah.

28:04.857 --> 28:06.206
Your days of exploiting kids

28:06.249 --> 28:08.208
to do your dirty work
ends tonight.

28:08.251 --> 28:10.123
I want you and
all your little buddies

28:10.906 --> 28:11.907
out of Riverdale.

28:13.909 --> 28:15.476
You and that
Louisville Slugger?

28:17.217 --> 28:18.261
[thugs murmuring]

28:19.785 --> 28:21.656
I'd take a closer look, friend.

28:25.051 --> 28:26.661
You're outnumbered
5-to-1.

28:30.143 --> 28:31.100
I'll take those odds.

28:33.233 --> 28:34.190
[neck cracks]

28:34.234 --> 28:35.844
[grunts]

28:35.888 --> 28:38.194
I'm sorry I came by
so late, Mrs. Andrews.

28:38.238 --> 28:40.196
No, not at all,
but Archie's in bed.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.111
I'm actually here to see you.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.855
That's $40,000.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.074
I'm giving it to you,

28:48.117 --> 28:50.859
to give to Archie
for the community center.

28:50.903 --> 28:52.513
He's too proud
to take it from me.

28:53.906 --> 28:54.820
Veronica...

28:55.821 --> 28:56.735
thank you.

28:57.910 --> 28:59.738
But we can't accept this.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.392
We can't be
in that kind of debt
to your family.

29:02.436 --> 29:04.481
And if you put that money
into the center,

29:04.525 --> 29:06.657
it keeps Archie here
in Riverdale,

29:06.701 --> 29:09.095
away from college,
away from his future.

29:10.270 --> 29:12.925
At the risk of overstepping,
Mrs. Andrews,

29:12.968 --> 29:15.057
I'm not investing
in a building,

29:15.101 --> 29:16.624
I'm investing in your son.

29:17.930 --> 29:18.974
I believe in Archie,

29:19.496 --> 29:20.802
and...

29:20.846 --> 29:23.109
he makes me want
to believe in myself.

29:23.152 --> 29:24.284
And I need that right now.

29:24.937 --> 29:26.286
[sighs]

29:26.329 --> 29:27.504
Tear the check up if you want.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.333
But I really hope you don't.

29:38.472 --> 29:40.082
[sighs]

29:40.126 --> 29:41.649
[Cheryl]
Rise and shine,
my dearest.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.956
It's another magnificent day
that's ours for the taking.

29:48.134 --> 29:49.004
Jay-Jay?

29:50.353 --> 29:51.790
Weren't you over there

29:51.833 --> 29:53.139
whilst I read to you
at nighttide?

30:00.755 --> 30:01.800
[Munroe] Red?

30:04.846 --> 30:05.673
[moans]

30:08.676 --> 30:10.460
What the hell happened?

30:10.504 --> 30:13.942
[grunts]
You should see Dodger
and the other guys.

30:13.986 --> 30:16.379
They're not going to be
messing with your brother
anytime soon. [chuckles]

30:16.423 --> 30:17.641
You went after them without me?

30:17.685 --> 30:18.860
And what happens
if those scumbags

30:18.904 --> 30:19.861
come looking for payback?

30:19.905 --> 30:21.820
They're not going to.

30:21.863 --> 30:22.995
I was in disguise.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.825
Oh, so you're a superhero now?

30:26.868 --> 30:28.130
Look, the good news is,

30:28.174 --> 30:29.740
we got enough money
to buy a second bathroom.

30:41.448 --> 30:42.710
Oh, hell no!

30:44.233 --> 30:46.018
You know we can't
use this, right?

30:46.061 --> 30:47.410
This money is dirty.

30:47.454 --> 30:48.716
Only a fool would
spend this cash.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.022
It needs to be cleaned first.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.067
[sighs]

30:57.768 --> 30:59.596
Any chance your girlfriend
could help us with that?

31:02.295 --> 31:05.864
So, we have three votes
for Story C.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.736
Which makes
makes Story C our winner,

31:08.779 --> 31:09.606
which is penned by...

31:11.086 --> 31:12.044
Donna Sweett.

31:15.438 --> 31:17.876
Stories A and B,

31:17.919 --> 31:20.095
written by Bret and Jughead,

31:21.053 --> 31:22.402
tied for last place.

31:24.491 --> 31:26.623
Well, at least
you didn't kill each other.

31:28.408 --> 31:29.235
[Alice] Elizabeth...

31:30.149 --> 31:31.280
Elizabeth?

31:31.802 --> 31:32.629
Elizabeth?

31:33.630 --> 31:34.457
Elizabeth?

31:38.244 --> 31:39.245
Mom.

31:41.638 --> 31:43.031
Where are we?

31:43.075 --> 31:44.467
In one of the motel rooms.

31:44.511 --> 31:45.729
Edgar's been keeping me here

31:45.773 --> 31:47.253
ever since he figured out
I was the mole.

31:48.776 --> 31:49.777
I'll kill him.

31:50.821 --> 31:52.084
Honey, I'm so sorry,

31:52.127 --> 31:53.912
I was trying to keep you safe.

31:53.955 --> 31:56.610
I didn't want you to know,
and I needed to get Polly out.

31:56.653 --> 31:57.916
Do you know
what Edgar's plan is?

31:59.961 --> 32:01.267
What?

32:01.310 --> 32:02.833
Evelyn is going to drive
the bus full of Farmies

32:02.877 --> 32:04.618
off of a cliff
as a distraction

32:05.358 --> 32:06.185
while he...

32:07.664 --> 32:08.970
What?

32:09.014 --> 32:10.276
Takes off in his rocket.

32:11.103 --> 32:11.973
What?

32:12.017 --> 32:12.974
Yeah.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.106
He bought a rocket?

32:14.149 --> 32:15.629
No, he's been building one.

32:18.153 --> 32:22.114
Yeah, because harvesting
organs isn't... isn't enough.

32:22.157 --> 32:24.594
What is he planning
to do with us?

32:24.638 --> 32:27.989
We're going to be tied
to the front of the bus
as shields.

32:28.033 --> 32:29.730
Unless we can figure out
a way out of here.

32:32.994 --> 32:34.996
I think
I actually have an idea.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.215
We have to get back to back.

32:39.740 --> 32:41.611
Miss Cheryl, Miss Antoinette,

32:41.655 --> 32:42.873
I'll be needing some money

32:42.917 --> 32:43.962
and the skeleton key
for the house.

32:44.658 --> 32:45.789
Excuse me?

32:45.833 --> 32:46.921
What possibly for?

32:46.965 --> 32:49.054
Thistlehouse has rats
in the walls.

32:51.317 --> 32:52.144
I went into the basement--

32:52.187 --> 32:53.319
Halt!

32:53.362 --> 32:55.016
You went down to the basement,

32:55.060 --> 32:57.497
specifically after
I ordered you not to?

32:59.064 --> 33:00.630
You didn't go into the chapel,
did you?

33:00.674 --> 33:01.849
No, Miss Cheryl--

33:01.892 --> 33:03.546
Thistlehouse has never
had rats.

33:03.590 --> 33:06.375
But, Babe, we did hear
something last night.

33:06.419 --> 33:07.507
Remember?

33:10.858 --> 33:12.033
No,

33:12.077 --> 33:13.687
you're right, Tee-Tee.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.907
[scoffs] And suddenly,

33:16.951 --> 33:19.998
I am feeling
the presence of a rat,

33:20.041 --> 33:23.262
a six-foot-tall rat
with muscles and bedroom eyes,

33:24.089 --> 33:25.699
Darius,

33:25.742 --> 33:27.266
I knew you were a mistake
from the beginning.

33:28.093 --> 33:29.355
So...

33:29.398 --> 33:30.225
[whispers] you're fired.

33:32.097 --> 33:33.054
Toodles.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.372
All right, ladies.

Ronnie, I hate to ask you this,

34:26.107 --> 34:27.674
but is there
anything you can do?

34:27.717 --> 34:29.371
Any way you can clean it,
so I can use it for the center?

Burn it.

34:37.162 --> 34:38.467
All of it.

34:38.511 --> 34:40.121
And let me pay
for the renovations.

34:40.165 --> 34:41.079
[sighs] Ronnie.

34:41.122 --> 34:42.297
Archie,

34:42.341 --> 34:44.908
please just forget
your pride for a second

34:44.952 --> 34:47.607
and let me be

34:47.650 --> 34:49.783
I need to be a part of

34:52.786 --> 34:54.135
Keep it moving,
keep it moving.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.659
Hey, Edgar has decreed
it's time to go. Okay?

34:56.703 --> 34:57.965
Everybody on the bus.
Keep moving.

34:59.140 --> 35:00.098
That's the thing about cults.

35:00.141 --> 35:01.099
Speak with enough authority,

35:01.142 --> 35:02.012
and they'll do
anything you say.

35:02.056 --> 35:03.362
Once we drive the Farmies out,

35:03.405 --> 35:04.841
Charles can move in
and take down Edgar. Okay?

Please. Okay?

35:15.200 --> 35:16.288
Keep... keep going.

35:16.331 --> 35:17.811
Keep going.
Keep moving, all right?

35:17.854 --> 35:18.855
Oh, no.

35:22.642 --> 35:23.469
Give me the gun.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.167
Get everybody on the bus.

-I'm going to stop Edgar.
-Okay.

Okay. Keep going, keep going.

35:31.912 --> 35:32.782
Mr. Weatherbee?

35:34.393 --> 35:35.872
I told Edgar I wasn't the mole,

35:35.916 --> 35:37.309
but he wouldn't listen.

35:37.352 --> 35:39.006
He cut it off.

Ms. Cooper, I don't know
how I let myself

Mr. Weatherbee,

35:45.230 --> 35:48.189
this is your last shot
at redemption. Okay?

35:49.538 --> 35:51.453
Get everybody on this bus.

Go. Please.

I'm inside the motel.

36:04.249 --> 36:05.119
Betty, you have got to
get out of there.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.207
Governor Dooley is sending in

36:06.251 --> 36:07.774
a team of mercenaries
right now.

36:07.817 --> 36:09.123
Tell them to stand down.

There's a busload of

including women and children,
headed your way.

36:14.694 --> 36:15.782
Hands up, Edgar.

Sister Alice.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.310
Come with me peacefully,
or so help me,

36:22.354 --> 36:23.659
I will shoot you
in the kneecaps

36:23.703 --> 36:25.487
and drag your ass
out of here myself.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.750
You betrayed us.

36:27.794 --> 36:29.143
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

36:29.883 --> 36:31.189
[gun cocks]

36:33.974 --> 36:35.976
Do you remember the story

36:36.019 --> 36:37.978
of the prophet Elijah, Alice?

36:38.021 --> 36:41.111
He was seized
by a whirlwind

36:41.155 --> 36:44.854
and lifted up into the sky
in a chariot of fire.

36:44.898 --> 36:47.030
Elijah ascended.

36:52.253 --> 36:53.211
And I will too.

Are you okay?

Need any help?

37:42.869 --> 37:44.349
Mom, what's going on?

37:44.392 --> 37:45.741
I was leaving,

37:45.785 --> 37:48.309
but what's going on is
I will be focusing

37:48.353 --> 37:51.051
more on pro bono work
in the foreseeable future,

37:51.094 --> 37:52.661
here in Riverdale.

37:52.705 --> 37:54.228
And my first order of business

37:54.272 --> 37:56.752
is to get your
community center
declared a 501[c][3].

37:57.797 --> 37:58.972
That's a non-profit.

37:59.015 --> 38:00.887
It means that
you can ask for donations,

38:00.930 --> 38:02.105
you don't have to pay taxes,

38:02.149 --> 38:03.237
you can apply for grants.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.240
Well, that's amazing.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.111
Except that I don't know
how to do any of that.

38:08.155 --> 38:09.287
[chuckles] Yeah.

38:09.330 --> 38:10.940
You're lot like
your dad in that way.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.246
[both chuckle]

38:12.290 --> 38:14.335
So, you'll just leave it to me,

38:14.379 --> 38:16.337
and you can go help
those kids out there.

38:17.077 --> 38:18.208
Deal.

38:18.252 --> 38:19.645
What happened to Chicago?

38:19.688 --> 38:21.951
Um... I'll call the airline
and cancel the flight.

38:21.995 --> 38:23.388
I don't think
I'll be back anytime soon.

38:27.566 --> 38:28.480
Hello, Daddy.

38:29.394 --> 38:30.656
I'm sure you'll be getting

38:30.699 --> 38:32.266
a call from
Mr. Sowerberry soon,

38:32.310 --> 38:35.095
but, I just wanted
to let you know
face to face

38:35.138 --> 38:36.966
that I'm no longer a Lodge.

to Veronica Luna.

38:46.498 --> 38:48.543
And I am changing the locks.

38:48.587 --> 38:50.110
And I'm installing an alarm.

38:50.153 --> 38:52.373
And I'm sleeping with a taser
under my pillow.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.115
And you better believe
I'll use it.

39:09.129 --> 39:10.435

39:55.088 --> 39:56.176

His dad was the Gargoyle King.

His real name is "Moose."

He was a broken man, Betty.

40:19.504 --> 40:21.244
And it was Bret, of course.

40:21.288 --> 40:24.987
He did it
because he blames me
for not winning the contest.

40:25.031 --> 40:26.641
Or maybe
he's just a sociopath.

40:26.685 --> 40:28.077
He knew that
he couldn't get to me directly

40:28.121 --> 40:29.992
so he went after Moose.

40:30.036 --> 40:32.299
This is nothing like
fighting the Ghoulies.

40:32.342 --> 40:34.257
This is psychological warfare.

40:34.301 --> 40:35.650
God. Poor Moose.

40:36.695 --> 40:38.000
Just be careful, Jug.

40:38.044 --> 40:39.611
Aw, don't worry about me.

40:41.003 --> 40:42.309
Hey, how's your mom and Polly?

40:43.223 --> 40:44.659
[laughs]

40:44.703 --> 40:47.227
My Mom was already working
on her expose of the Farm.

40:48.010 --> 40:49.403
Polly started this program

40:49.447 --> 40:51.318
at the Shady Grove
Treatment Center.

40:51.361 --> 40:53.146
She's getting the help
that she needs.

40:54.321 --> 40:55.496
What about Charles?

40:55.540 --> 40:57.106
Is he the real deal?
Can we trust him?

40:59.326 --> 41:00.283
Yeah, I think so.

41:02.198 --> 41:04.157
I'm just happy that
this nightmare is...

41:04.723 --> 41:06.202
finally over.

41:07.552 --> 41:08.727
[doorbell rings]

41:29.922 --> 41:31.489
[wind blowing]

41:44.371 --> 41:46.025
Famous last words.
