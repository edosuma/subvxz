WEBVTT

00:09.966 --> 00:10.923
Hey, Gem.
Hey, Tina.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.925
Come on in.
I'm almost done here.

00:12.969 --> 00:16.059
Wow. This is the first time I've
been in the principal's office

00:16.103 --> 00:17.887
without being
dragged in screaming,

00:17.930 --> 00:19.410
"I didn't do it!"

00:20.498 --> 00:22.457
Hmm. Did you do it?

00:22.500 --> 00:23.849
Every time.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.156
So, where are we headin' to
for lunch?

00:26.200 --> 00:27.636
Anywhere but the cafeteria.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.333
There was a food fight
last week,

00:29.377 --> 00:32.684
and I took a taco
to the chest.
Ooh.

00:32.728 --> 00:35.992
Sorry to interrupt, Gemma, but
there was an incident at lunch.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.907
Oh, no.
How many tacos are missing,

00:37.950 --> 00:40.127
and how many kids were hurt?

00:40.170 --> 00:42.999
No, a student punched
another student in the face.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.087
TINA:
Aah.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.481
Please. Rookie mistake.

00:46.524 --> 00:49.049
Everybody knows that body blows
are harder to prove.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.096
Okay, send him in, Lorraine.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.489
I'm sorry, Tina.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.708
I just have
to take care of this.
Ah.

00:56.752 --> 00:59.059
You know, most of the students
here are really well-behaved,

00:59.102 --> 01:00.669
but there are a few bad apples.

01:00.712 --> 01:03.063
Hi, Mom.

01:04.194 --> 01:05.717
He didn't do it!

01:07.676 --> 01:09.591
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:09.634 --> 01:10.853
♪ Welcome to the hood.

01:26.564 --> 01:28.827
Hey, Dave.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.092
Hey, Calvin.
Didn't see you there.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.487
Hey, so I, uh, heard

01:36.531 --> 01:38.707
Grover got into a fight
at school yesterday.

01:38.750 --> 01:42.276
Yeah, apparently, this kid
Justin has been bullying him.

01:42.319 --> 01:44.147
Pushing him, making
fun of his clothes,

01:44.191 --> 01:46.236
which makes no sense,

01:46.280 --> 01:50.110
because I spent a lot of
time picking them out.

01:51.241 --> 01:53.939
Oh, wow.
That's... that's rough, man.

01:53.983 --> 01:56.986
So, where are you taking him
to celebrate?

01:57.029 --> 01:58.466
What? Celebrate?

01:58.509 --> 02:00.337
Yeah, he's one and oh!

02:00.381 --> 02:02.209
That's how Tyson got started.

02:02.252 --> 02:04.950
The kid's lucky
he didn't bite his ear off.

02:06.996 --> 02:09.390
Okay, well,
in our house,

02:09.433 --> 02:11.870
we don't believe that
violence solves problems.

02:11.914 --> 02:14.003
Well, this didn't sound
like violence.

02:14.046 --> 02:16.310
I mean, this was more
like self-defense.

02:16.353 --> 02:18.312
Grover just did
what he had to do.

02:18.355 --> 02:22.011
And what you have to do
is stop picking out his clothes.

02:22.054 --> 02:24.056
Look...

02:24.100 --> 02:26.058
Calvin, I'm not naive.
When I was in the military,

02:26.102 --> 02:29.061
I saw what violence does to
people, and it's never good.

02:29.105 --> 02:33.196
And please don't try to tell me
that jean shorts aren't cool.

02:34.980 --> 02:38.549
Look, if someone
pushes you too far,

02:38.593 --> 02:40.725
at some point,
you have to push back.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.423
Every man has
his breaking point.

02:42.466 --> 02:44.947
Well, I disagree...

02:44.990 --> 02:46.557
and let me tell you why.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.080
Oh, looky there.
I just reached mine.

02:55.305 --> 02:58.352
Really? You two playing
video games again?

02:58.395 --> 02:59.875
Yeah, we're
playing Madden.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.920
Oh. In that case,
I got next.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.228
Yeah, man.What's the score?

03:05.272 --> 03:07.099
I'm up, 21-17.

03:07.143 --> 03:09.189
Oh, this game
is over, man.

03:11.452 --> 03:13.149
Dad, there's
eight minutes left,

03:13.193 --> 03:14.411
I'm on his ten yard line.

03:14.455 --> 03:16.761
Not anymore. Reset.

03:19.155 --> 03:22.245
Hey, did you hear that Grover
beat some kid up in school?

03:22.289 --> 03:23.768
Yeah.

03:23.812 --> 03:26.118
Dave told me
the kid was bullying him.

03:26.162 --> 03:28.817
Clearly, he didn't know Grover
lives in a black neighborhood.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.647
I live in a black neighborhood,

03:32.690 --> 03:34.214
and I never stood up
to my bully.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.519
What? You had a bully?

03:35.563 --> 03:37.478
Yeah, for a long time.

03:37.521 --> 03:39.523
Well, you should have
did something.

03:39.567 --> 03:42.091
You know, give him
the old two-piece and a biscuit.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.616
I couldn't.
He was way bigger than me.

03:45.660 --> 03:48.663
So? Look, if you let people
push you around,

03:48.706 --> 03:50.447
they'll do it to you
the rest of your life.

03:50.491 --> 03:53.015
You know what?
You're right.

03:53.058 --> 03:55.191
Give me that!

04:00.544 --> 04:02.067
What the hell are you doing?

04:02.111 --> 04:04.505
Well, it's just what you said.

04:04.548 --> 04:06.637
I'm standing up to my bully.Me?!

04:06.681 --> 04:09.466
Go on, Marty. Give him the
old two-piece and a biscuit.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.255
Look, Marty, I'm your father.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.953
I'm not your bully.Oh, really?

04:17.996 --> 04:19.781
What about
when my friends came over

04:19.824 --> 04:21.957
to play Dungeons & Dragons,
and you pretended

04:22.000 --> 04:24.525
to cast a spell
of eternal virginity on us?

04:28.616 --> 04:31.314
It wasn't right,
but he wasn't wrong.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.622
Look, now, I did that
for your benefit.

04:34.665 --> 04:36.667
I didn't want you
to be the weird guy

04:36.711 --> 04:38.495
that got picked on
by the other boys.

04:38.539 --> 04:39.801
It was last Tuesday, Dad.

04:42.238 --> 04:44.501
Oh, yeah, I remember,
because up until then,

04:44.545 --> 04:48.288
I'd never seen anybody
wear suspenders anda belt.

04:50.202 --> 04:51.508
Well, all I know is,
you embarrassed me

04:51.552 --> 04:52.814
in front of my friends.

04:52.857 --> 04:54.032
Okay, Marty, look...

04:54.076 --> 04:55.120
And-and for your
information,

04:55.164 --> 04:56.600
it was not a belt.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.167
It was a sash!

05:02.737 --> 05:04.826
I know it's the weekend,
but I feel like

05:04.869 --> 05:07.132
we should deal with this
as soon as possible.

05:07.176 --> 05:09.874
Okay, then, I'll see you
in my office tomorrow.

05:09.918 --> 05:12.224
And again, I'm sorry
this happened to your son.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.011
Your jerk-face bullyof a son!

05:19.449 --> 05:21.059
You okay?

05:21.103 --> 05:23.279
No! I'm the principal, Dave.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.629
My son isn't supposed to
be beating up other kids!

05:25.673 --> 05:28.415
Even if they are a
bratty little snot wad.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.374
Okay, yes,

05:31.418 --> 05:33.724
clearly, Grover
was provoked.

05:33.768 --> 05:37.728
But I think we can both agree
that violence is not the answer.

05:37.772 --> 05:40.601
Of course it isn't.Okay. Good.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.559
But why would you buy him
those stupid jean shorts?!

05:42.603 --> 05:44.605
Ow!

05:47.129 --> 05:48.739
O-O-Okay.

05:48.783 --> 05:52.264
Look, I know this puts you
in a tough position,

05:52.308 --> 05:54.745
but maybe I can help.How?

05:54.789 --> 05:57.792
Let me take Grover to his house,
have him apologize,

05:57.835 --> 05:59.794
and diffuse the situation
before the meeting.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.448
That's a good idea.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.275
I'll come with you.

06:03.319 --> 06:04.842
That sounds great.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.977
That way I can slash
his stupid bike tires!

06:10.848 --> 06:13.851
Or, you know, maybe
you sit this one out.

06:18.116 --> 06:21.032
Tina, it's official.

06:21.076 --> 06:23.078
You failed as a mother.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.560
What are you talking about?

06:26.603 --> 06:28.779
Marty. You made him soft

06:28.823 --> 06:32.130
with all your hugs and
kisses and bedtime stories.

06:32.174 --> 06:35.046
Well, if you want
another bedtime story,

06:35.090 --> 06:37.440
you better think about the next
thing that comes out your mouth.

06:38.963 --> 06:41.662
Baby, the boy just told
me that I was his bully.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.098
Can you believe that?

06:43.141 --> 06:45.230
Hell, yeah.What?!

06:45.274 --> 06:46.797
Tina, you're my wife.

06:46.841 --> 06:50.235
It's supposed to be me
and you against the kids.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.455
Look, babe, I know
what a good father you are

06:52.499 --> 06:54.152
and how much you love Marty,
but sometimes

06:54.196 --> 06:56.807
you go a little too far when
you make fun of his hobbies.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.461
I don't know.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.245
These kids today--
they're just weak.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.944
I mean, when I was coming up,
it wasn't bullying

07:02.987 --> 07:05.163
unless something
was cut, broken

07:05.207 --> 07:06.556
or set on fire.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.776
Oh, I know.

07:08.819 --> 07:12.475
I went to the principal's office
for all three of those.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.651
Marty's just a little
more sensitive than us.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.697
Yeah, I guess
maybe you're right.

07:16.740 --> 07:19.177
But when he called me his bully,

07:19.221 --> 07:21.353
it just really hurt my feelings.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.536
Dad, do I have
to apologize?

07:29.579 --> 07:31.842
Yes, Grover. When you do
something wrong to someone,

07:31.886 --> 07:33.975
you owe them an apology.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.673
You should give me one
for buying those jean shorts.

07:38.893 --> 07:41.504
Hi. Can I help you?

07:41.548 --> 07:44.028
Hi. I'm Dave Johnson,
Grover's father.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.769
Oh.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.513
Probably a good idea.

07:50.557 --> 07:53.211
It's, uh, cold and flu season.

07:53.255 --> 07:54.343
What are you guys doing here?

07:54.386 --> 07:56.824
Grover wanted
to apologize to Justin.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.869
And you think
my son wants an apology

07:58.913 --> 08:00.741
from the little punk
who sucker-punched him?

08:02.569 --> 08:04.484
He's lucky
Justin didn't kick his ass.

08:06.921 --> 08:09.314
Do I stillhave
to apologize?

08:11.360 --> 08:13.710
Yes. Uh, look, man,
I know that you're upset,

08:13.754 --> 08:15.756
but I don't think
calling my son names

08:15.799 --> 08:17.540
is gonna make the situation
any better.

08:17.584 --> 08:21.631
Hmm. Well, yoursituation's
about to get a lot worse

08:21.675 --> 08:23.851
if you don't
get out of my face.

08:26.027 --> 08:28.856
Okay, I...I think if
we both just stay calm...

08:30.727 --> 08:32.903
Now there's no need
to push me like that.

08:32.947 --> 08:36.124
Yeah? Oh, how about
I push you like this?

08:42.130 --> 08:44.132
Fella...

08:45.699 --> 08:48.353
You're about this close
to losing that apology.

08:51.356 --> 08:54.359
Hey, Marty... hold up.

08:54.403 --> 08:55.839
What?

08:55.883 --> 08:57.798
What are you doing tomorrow?

08:57.841 --> 08:59.669
Oh, I was going apple-picking
with some friends.

09:06.154 --> 09:08.460
Sounds delightful.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.768
But, uh, maybe when you're done,

09:11.812 --> 09:14.379
you can come back here,
and we can play some

09:14.423 --> 09:16.599
of that, uh, Dungeon & Dragons.

09:16.643 --> 09:19.471
I never tried it,
and, uh, seems like fun.

09:20.995 --> 09:23.606
Mama, get out here! I think
Daddy's having a stroke!

09:25.826 --> 09:27.784
I'm not having a stroke.

09:27.828 --> 09:30.352
I'm trying to show some interest
in your stupid hobby.

09:31.353 --> 09:34.704
I'm sorry. That came out wrong.

09:34.748 --> 09:37.141
Are you serious? You
really want to do this?

09:37.185 --> 09:38.490
Absolutely.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.492
Okay. Great.

09:40.536 --> 09:42.973
Well, thanks, Dad. Ah.All right. Ah.

09:43.017 --> 09:46.107
Prepareth thee for adventure!

09:56.639 --> 09:58.554
Oh, my God, what happened?!

10:00.382 --> 10:03.254
Justin's dad got a little
heated, and he punched me.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.996
What?! Are you okay?

10:06.040 --> 10:07.345
Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

10:07.389 --> 10:10.000
I can't believe
he beat you up.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.741
No, Mom, he didn't!

10:11.785 --> 10:13.177
Dad totally kicked his butt!

10:13.221 --> 10:14.701
It was awesome!

10:18.530 --> 10:20.358
Is that true?

10:20.402 --> 10:22.491
It wasn't what I wanted.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.973
But it was pretty awesome.

10:33.545 --> 10:34.851
You should have
seen it, Mom!

10:34.895 --> 10:36.287
Justin's dad
punched him,

10:36.331 --> 10:37.854
but then Dad gave him
a couple of these.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.468
And then Justin's dad went down.

10:43.512 --> 10:44.687
And then Dad said...

10:44.731 --> 10:45.819
Grover, please, go to your room.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.168
No-no-no-no-no,
that's not what he said.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.913
There were way more curse words.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.219
Okay, you know what?

10:55.263 --> 10:56.873
Grover, Mom's right.
Go to your room.

10:56.917 --> 10:59.746
Okay. Okay,
I don't want any trouble.

11:03.358 --> 11:05.882
I can't believe you
got into a fight.

11:05.926 --> 11:07.536
In front of our son?

11:07.579 --> 11:09.669
I know. I'm sorry.

11:10.278 --> 11:13.411
But if someone
pushes you too far,

11:13.455 --> 11:16.632
at some point...

11:16.676 --> 11:18.286
you have to push back.

11:20.114 --> 11:23.291
Every man
has his breaking point.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.728
That's the most
ridiculous thing I've...

11:25.772 --> 11:27.469
Did you get that from Calvin?

11:28.470 --> 11:29.689
No.

11:30.646 --> 11:31.952
Okay, yes.

11:33.997 --> 11:36.478
Dave, I'm the
school principal.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.306
Do you know how
this makes me look?

11:39.307 --> 11:40.656
He started it.

11:43.137 --> 11:46.531
Really, Dave?
That's your excuse?

11:49.317 --> 11:50.797
Told Grover that wouldn't work.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.454
All right! Let's do this.

11:56.498 --> 11:57.934
Hold on, Malcolm's playing, too?

11:57.978 --> 11:59.457
I didn't know
you liked this game.

11:59.501 --> 12:00.502
I don't.

12:00.545 --> 12:01.764
But I want to be here

12:01.808 --> 12:03.374
when you flip the table
and storm out.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.422
Look, I don't know the rules,

12:07.465 --> 12:10.555
but is there any way
I can feed him to a dragon?

12:10.599 --> 12:15.343
Well, all things are possible
in the Goblin Castle of Alkobar.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.956
Oh, boy, here comes the table.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.005
So, how long
is this game gon' take?

12:25.048 --> 12:26.441
20 minutes? Half hour?

12:26.484 --> 12:28.051
Oh, no. But if we hustle,

12:28.095 --> 12:29.444
we can do it in half a day.

12:31.054 --> 12:32.621
Half a day?

12:32.664 --> 12:35.624
Wow, that's almost like
too much fun.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.671
Okay. So,
let's get right to it.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.543
Okay.
I already created
characters for you both.

12:41.586 --> 12:42.849
Malcolm.
Yes.

12:42.892 --> 12:45.373
You are Shadow Fang,
a fighter elf.

12:48.332 --> 12:50.247
You're a little tiny-ass elf!

12:51.292 --> 12:52.815
Actually, Dad,

12:52.859 --> 12:54.904
it's a common misconception
that elves are little.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.340
They're actually known
for being tall

12:56.384 --> 12:58.168
and lean
and extremely dexterous.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.866
Oh. Okay. Well, in that case,

12:59.909 --> 13:01.737
I guess I'm an elf, too.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.348
It's too late.
You a tiny-ass dwarf.

13:08.091 --> 13:10.180
And my name is Galumpkin?

13:10.224 --> 13:12.400
Yes! Galumpkin the Great,
king of the dwarves.

13:12.443 --> 13:13.836
You're an eighth-level barbarian

13:13.880 --> 13:15.490
who fights
with an enchanted battle ax.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.536
Well, all right! Okay.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.364
All right, so,
who you gonna be, Marty?

13:20.408 --> 13:21.844
Oh, no,
I'm not one of the characters.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.237
I am the Dungeon Master,

13:23.280 --> 13:24.891
the all-knowing,
omnipotent guide

13:24.934 --> 13:26.544
through your epic journey.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.459
And I get to wear this hat.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.040
Hey, there.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.433
Oh, hi, Tina.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.392
Damn, Dave,
what happened to you?

13:48.436 --> 13:50.090
Somebody whup your ass?

13:51.091 --> 13:52.570
No.

13:52.614 --> 13:55.095
I went to talk things out
with Justin's dad,

13:55.138 --> 13:58.533
but he took a swing at me,
so I had to fight back.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.056
Wow, Dave.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.710
I didn't know
you had it in you.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.277
So, you won?

14:06.106 --> 14:08.630
I totally kicked his ass.

14:09.631 --> 14:10.980
Well, good for you

14:11.024 --> 14:13.156
for doing something
incredibly stupid.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.073
He hit me first.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.510
Oh, yeah.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.382
You know, that was always
my excuse, too.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.079
Or "I didn't do it!"

14:23.123 --> 14:25.995
Or "Karen stuffed her own head
in the toilet!" I mean...

14:26.039 --> 14:29.216
What was I supposed to do?
Just walk away?

14:29.259 --> 14:32.306
Look, I feel you,
Dave, but think about Gemma.

14:32.349 --> 14:34.525
What if this gets out
to the other parents?

14:34.569 --> 14:37.093
This undermines
her credibility at work.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.139
She could lose her job.

14:40.183 --> 14:42.272
I know. You're right.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.100
I-I got to fix this.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.233
It's all right.
I'm sure you'll find a way.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.975
Thanks, Tina.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.193
Hey, so, what did Karen do

14:50.237 --> 14:51.499
to make you stuff her head
in the toilet?

14:51.542 --> 14:53.718
She gave me a "C" on a test.

14:56.983 --> 14:59.942
Okay. You finally emerge

14:59.986 --> 15:02.902
from the mountain pass
into a clearing,

15:02.945 --> 15:04.555
where you discover...

15:04.599 --> 15:05.948
a stone giant!

15:05.992 --> 15:07.602
Damn it. Malcolm,

15:07.645 --> 15:10.387
I told you
what made those footprints.

15:10.431 --> 15:13.042
Well, look, Pop, there's no way
we can beat a stone giant.

15:13.086 --> 15:15.262
Let's just backtrack
and go the other way.

15:15.305 --> 15:16.654
Are you kidding me?

15:16.698 --> 15:18.830
And go back through
the Swamp of Lost Souls?

15:18.874 --> 15:20.528
I'm not going back there.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.662
Look, come on, Pop.
Let's just run away.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.664
No. No, no, man.

15:26.708 --> 15:29.276
We can beat
this fool right here.

15:29.319 --> 15:30.973
You know what?

15:31.017 --> 15:32.670
I drink a potion of strength

15:32.714 --> 15:35.325
while I cast
a spell of confusion

15:35.369 --> 15:38.372
while attacking
with my enchanted battle ax!Yeah.

15:39.851 --> 15:43.116
Watch out, giant.
Here come the pain!

15:44.160 --> 15:45.640
That's a one. You die.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.991
What?

15:49.035 --> 15:51.515
No, that can't be right, man.
I'm Galumpkin.

15:51.559 --> 15:54.127
G-Love! The Lump Dawg!

15:55.128 --> 15:56.956
I'm sorry, Dad.
The dice don't lie.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.175
Well, we not giving up.
Ain't that right, Malcolm?

15:59.219 --> 16:00.742
Peace out, Lump Dawg.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.355
All right,
thanks for playing, Dad.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.531
Wh-What do you mean,
"Thanks for playing"?

16:07.575 --> 16:10.230
You can't talk to the king
of the dwarves like that.

16:10.273 --> 16:11.753
Come on, run it back.

16:11.796 --> 16:14.277
No, you don't have to.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.976
I know I don't haveto,
but I want to.

16:18.803 --> 16:21.371
Yeah, but you two always
make fun of me for this stuff.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.199
Yeah, I know.

16:23.243 --> 16:25.375
But, uh...

16:25.419 --> 16:28.030
you know, sometimes I, uh...

16:28.074 --> 16:29.423
You know me.

16:29.466 --> 16:32.469
You know, I don't say
things that, uh...

16:35.603 --> 16:37.561
You know what I'm saying?

16:37.605 --> 16:38.998
You know what I mean?

16:41.435 --> 16:43.654
Dad...

16:43.698 --> 16:45.961
that is the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

16:50.705 --> 16:53.012
Well, I meant every word, son.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.928
Look, Marty,

16:56.972 --> 16:58.930
look, I don't want
to be your bully.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.324
I'm your father, all
right? And I love you.

17:01.368 --> 17:02.673
I love you, too.Come on, then.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.719
Come on, boy.

17:09.941 --> 17:12.031
I really appreciate
you doing this with me.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.858
It means a lot.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.469
Good. Good.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.297
All right, now, sit
your ass back down

17:17.340 --> 17:19.342
and put your stupid
hat on. Let's go.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.743
Thank you for coming in,
and please know

17:28.786 --> 17:31.224
I take this situation
very seriously.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.878
You should. First,
your kid assaults Justin,

17:33.922 --> 17:35.967
then your husband attacks me.

17:36.011 --> 17:39.449
Apparently, our family
isn't safe at school or at home.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.843
I understand, but I assure you,

17:41.886 --> 17:44.019
Justin and you
are completely safe.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.455
Hello.

17:49.329 --> 17:50.765
Dave, what are you doing here?

17:50.808 --> 17:51.896
I'm looking for Ed.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.289
I told you he was crazy.

17:53.333 --> 17:56.118
I just came to apologize.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.903
I never should have let things
escalate the way that they did.

17:58.947 --> 18:00.253
Well, you should have
thought of that

18:00.296 --> 18:02.168
before you beat him
with his own shoe.

18:03.952 --> 18:07.129
Okay, clearly,
mistakes were made,

18:07.173 --> 18:09.697
and we all have
a lot of healing to do.

18:09.740 --> 18:13.222
Really? Is anyone else getting
their stitches out on Friday?

18:15.877 --> 18:17.835
We didn't come here

18:17.879 --> 18:19.533
for an apology.

18:19.576 --> 18:22.013
We came here to tell you that
we're contacting a lawyer.

18:22.057 --> 18:24.015
And after we're done,

18:24.059 --> 18:26.148
you're not going to be able
to get a job anywhere.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.497
Okay, wait a second.

18:27.541 --> 18:28.542
Dave, let me handle this.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.196
No. Your husband and your son

18:30.239 --> 18:32.067
are a couple of animals.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.156
"Animals"?

18:34.200 --> 18:36.463
You heard me. Let's go, Ed.

18:36.506 --> 18:37.681
Dave.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.727
Uh, we should hear her out.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.341
Here's what's gonna happen.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.517
Grover's going to be suspended
for fighting.

18:47.561 --> 18:50.390
Justin's going to be suspended
for bullying.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.044
But...Did I call on you?

18:55.438 --> 18:57.092
As a show of good will,

18:57.136 --> 18:59.050
Dave is not gonna press charges
against Ed

18:59.094 --> 19:00.487
for attacking him first.

19:00.530 --> 19:03.316
And in return, you won't
press charges against Dave

19:03.359 --> 19:05.100
for making Ed his bitch.

19:10.671 --> 19:12.716
That's it.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.414
I'm calling the
board of trustees.

19:14.457 --> 19:18.157
Fine. And I'm calling the IRS
to report you for tax evasion.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.723
What are
you talking about?

19:19.767 --> 19:22.073
I'm talking about how
your seven-year-old son

19:22.117 --> 19:24.206
is the registered owner
of a 20-foot sailboat

19:24.250 --> 19:26.077
named Take it Sleazy.

19:28.776 --> 19:31.170
It was all her idea.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.869
You know what?

19:34.912 --> 19:37.350
Things did get out of hand,

19:37.393 --> 19:40.222
but it sounds like you've got
the situation under control.

19:42.050 --> 19:44.008
Finally, we agree on something.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.662
C-Can we...

19:45.706 --> 19:47.621
You may go.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.935
That was amazing.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.372
Thank you.

19:59.415 --> 20:00.634
How'd you know
about the boat?

20:00.677 --> 20:02.331
Justin's not just a bully.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.854
He's also a blabbermouth.

20:03.898 --> 20:06.161
And, word on the playground,
a bedwetter.

20:08.772 --> 20:11.427
I can't believe how well
you kept your cool.

20:11.471 --> 20:13.516
You know, apparently,
Calvin was wrong.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.910
Not everyone has
a breaking point.

20:15.953 --> 20:18.869
Oh, no. If she had said one
more word about you or Grover,

20:18.913 --> 20:21.611
that ho would've been
on the flo'.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.709
Congratulations,
adventurers.

20:32.753 --> 20:34.711
You found the exit
to the Labyrinth of Despair.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.496
You emerge into the light.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.628
Boom! Yeah!
Yes!

20:39.629 --> 20:42.066
But your path
has been blocked

20:42.110 --> 20:43.198
by a man-eating ogre!

20:43.242 --> 20:44.460
What?Come on!

20:46.114 --> 20:48.029
What do you do?

20:49.552 --> 20:51.162
I say we try reasoning with him.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.425
Let's lay down our weapons

20:52.468 --> 20:55.079
and let him know
that we come in peace.

20:55.123 --> 20:56.559
Good plan.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.648
Good plan. Like it.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.955
I'm gonna go ahead
and kill Dave.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.870
