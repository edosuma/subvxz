WEBVTT

00:00.334 --> 00:03.378
WOMAN: Previously on
Motherland.

00:03.378 --> 00:05.005
WOMAN: Speaking of people
coming back...

00:05.005 --> 00:07.257
Alder, she's back.

00:07.257 --> 00:09.009
ADIL: She's off with Khalida,
looking for the First Song.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.011
-Where's Raelle?
-Dead.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.012
She's not dead.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.847
She's healing.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.849
In the Mycelium.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.309
Stay here and meet with
the council when they arrive.

00:17.309 --> 00:19.061
We need their support
for what's ahead.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.812
Why are they trying to kill me?

00:20.812 --> 00:22.856
Because you're a steward
of the First Song.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.733
-I'll take you somewhere safe.
-If you need me

00:24.733 --> 00:25.943
or you're in danger...

00:28.028 --> 00:29.905
use this.

00:29.905 --> 00:33.033
Meet your personal oversight,
Colonel Jarrett.

00:33.033 --> 00:36.161
Colonel?

00:36.161 --> 00:40.249
Army versus Spree!

00:43.961 --> 00:45.337
No.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.756
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.841
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Okay.

00:51.510 --> 00:54.012
WOMAN: Sounds like you haven't
found your voice yet, Albie.

00:54.012 --> 00:56.181
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:58.016 --> 01:01.144
It's merely a work in progress,
which I'll harness soon enough.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.896
-WOMAN: I saw her!
-WOMAN: Who?

01:02.896 --> 01:04.648
WOMAN: Raelle.

01:04.648 --> 01:06.942
There was nothing left.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.403
I think she might end the world.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.160
Hurry up, we'll be late.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.621
Cortez, you're the only person
in the world

01:19.621 --> 01:20.998
who gets excited
for Mothertongue.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.207
What can I say?

01:22.207 --> 01:24.334
I'm the Mistress of Menishe.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.468
Professor Grafton,
what's happening?

01:35.178 --> 01:37.055
Mothertongue
has been cancelled today.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.348
What? Why?

01:38.348 --> 01:40.392
Lupe, it--

01:40.392 --> 01:41.560
I'll answer that.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.978
What's your name?

01:42.978 --> 01:45.147
Officer Cadet Guadalupe Cortez.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.231
Astarte Coven.

01:46.231 --> 01:50.277
Well, Cadet Cortez, as you know,

01:50.277 --> 01:52.863
myself and my fellow
Oversight Officers

01:52.863 --> 01:54.948
are on base to ensure that

01:54.948 --> 01:58.160
witches are no longer seen
as a separate society

01:58.160 --> 01:59.786
in our nation,

01:59.786 --> 02:02.831
to reassure
the American people that witches

02:02.831 --> 02:05.959
are being held accountable
for their actions.

02:05.959 --> 02:10.172
And yet somehow,
a secret language spoken only by

02:10.172 --> 02:15.052
witches seems counterproductive
to those aims, does it not?

02:15.052 --> 02:16.887
But there's so much history and

02:16.887 --> 02:18.138
-cultural significance.
-Classes are postponed

02:18.138 --> 02:19.806
until further notice.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.017
Do you have any more questions?

02:26.521 --> 02:28.940
Anything else?

02:28.940 --> 02:31.777
(speaking foreign language)

02:36.698 --> 02:37.991
Enjoy your day.

02:58.345 --> 03:01.348
(theme music playing)

03:57.404 --> 03:59.990
(dramatic music playing)

03:59.990 --> 04:02.409
Maybe we should tell
the council about Wade.

04:02.409 --> 04:06.413
No, she said we shouldn't tell
anyone, not even them.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.457
I mean, she and The Marshal
were both pretty clear

04:08.457 --> 04:10.459
-about that.
-But why?

04:10.459 --> 04:13.628
How do we know
we can even trust The Marshal?

04:13.628 --> 04:16.047
How do you know you can trust
the Council?

04:16.047 --> 04:17.924
You know what?
It's not about trust.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.093
We're innocent
and that's what matters.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.305
Once we make our case,
they'll recognize that.

04:23.305 --> 04:26.016
You cannot be that naive.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.768
You can't prove Wade's alive.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.811
We've brought a lot of heat
down on the Cession.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.480
The Council
can't just ignore that.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.440
Then we'll make them listen
to reason.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.609
You can't punch your way
out of this one.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.235
When I said make them listen
to reason,

04:37.235 --> 04:39.196
I actually meant reason
with them.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.948
Why are you so skittish about
meeting the Council anyways?

04:41.948 --> 04:44.534
I'm not gonna meet them.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.829
You forget my situation
is much different than yours.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.040
And the Spree...

04:50.040 --> 04:52.209
how are you gonna avoid it?

04:52.209 --> 04:54.252
They got to drop the wards
when they arrive.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.171
-I'll sneak out the back door.
-TALLY: You're gonna leave us

04:56.171 --> 04:58.381
just like that?

04:58.381 --> 05:00.717
But where--
where are you gonna go?

05:00.717 --> 05:02.302
Don't worry about me, Red.
You know I always land

05:02.302 --> 05:03.595
on my feet.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.141
They're here.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.894
(dramatic music playing)

05:30.872 --> 05:32.666
They're not what I expected.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.418
They represent seven
different language groups,

05:35.418 --> 05:37.587
each with their own
unique traditions.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.590
It's like nations
within a nation.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.634
I spent a lot of time
in the Cession growing up.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.469
I even went to elementary
school for a while.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.767
Come on.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.143
We need to make our case. Now.

05:57.941 --> 06:00.735
The Council of the Great River
will summon you shortly.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.572
(dramatic music playing)

06:16.877 --> 06:20.755
(gasping)

06:20.755 --> 06:23.675
(panting)

06:28.388 --> 06:31.308
I've got good news and bad news.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.395
Good news is I fixed you.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.521
You okay?

06:38.440 --> 06:40.400
I feel like shit but I'm alive.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.737
What's the bad news?

06:46.281 --> 06:47.908
They wanna cut out our throats.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.535
(dramatic music playing)

07:03.048 --> 07:05.216
They've been in there
for over an hour.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.509
It's like we're sitting
at the kids' table

07:06.509 --> 07:07.969
while the adults
decide our fate.

07:09.512 --> 07:10.764
What is going on in there?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.682
I have to tell you something.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.143
I saw something,
something bad in the future,

07:15.143 --> 07:18.063
something that we have to stop.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.648
I'm sorry, what did you say?

07:19.648 --> 07:21.608
Look, okay.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.652
During Yule,
I saw a vision of the future

07:23.652 --> 07:25.654
where Raelle released
a Witchbomb

07:25.654 --> 07:27.072
that was destroying the world.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.325
Well, I didn't see
that one coming.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.664
Yeah. I'm sorry
I didn't tell you sooner.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.666
I wanted to, but...

07:37.666 --> 07:41.127
Tally, you can't trust
a thing Nicte taught you.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.463
She lies as easy as breathing.

07:43.463 --> 07:47.050
What I saw was terrible.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.928
I mean, it looked
like the end of everything.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.971
I think you're just missing
Raelle so much

07:51.971 --> 07:54.307
that it's scrambling your sight.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.351
And I get it.

07:56.351 --> 07:59.437
I have yet to have a night
where I didn't dream about her.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.563
Yeah.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.150
Maybe you're right.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.361
One thing at a time, okay?

08:06.361 --> 08:08.363
Let's get through today

08:08.363 --> 08:11.366
and then we will get
Raelle back.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.576
Then we can worry
about whatever else comes next.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.163
Whatever it is,
we'll take care of it.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.374
And what can we do?

08:19.374 --> 08:20.458
I don't know.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.130
Wait, have you ever tested it?

08:26.673 --> 08:28.341
Seen something
and then tried to prevent it?

08:32.470 --> 08:33.847
There you go.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.683
(dramatic music playing)

09:04.627 --> 09:06.504
It's time.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.547
You coming, Baby Spree?

09:09.007 --> 09:10.842
My place is with them now.

09:10.842 --> 09:13.511
And with Raelle.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.138
I really do
hope you get her back.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.825
We're ready for you now.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.540
Follow my lead.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.011
Yes.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.569
Esteemed members of the Council
of the Great River,

10:11.569 --> 10:12.904
I'm Abigail...

10:12.904 --> 10:14.197
Bellweather.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.074
We know.

10:16.074 --> 10:19.285
We thank you for the opportunity
to prove our innocence,

10:19.285 --> 10:20.578
but first...

10:30.672 --> 10:34.175
(speaking foreign language)

10:44.811 --> 10:46.187
Wow. Mothertongue.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.065
(Adil speaking foreign language)

11:08.543 --> 11:12.380
MILLY: Well, would you listen
to that handsome songbird sing.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.136
ABIGAIL: We'd respectfully ask
to be sheltered on your land

11:18.136 --> 11:20.305
until it is safe for us
to return home.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.723
Sheltered?

11:21.723 --> 11:24.767
What are you, a lost kitten?

11:24.767 --> 11:26.102
I don't think
you understand, soldier.

11:26.102 --> 11:29.397
We've already made up our minds.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.692
We're sending you all back
to where you belong, to D. C.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.783
I don't understand.
Why did you wanna meet with us

11:40.783 --> 11:42.577
if you're just sending us back?

11:42.577 --> 11:44.329
Because we need answers.

11:44.329 --> 11:47.624
But need is a bit,
hyperbolic, Pauline.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.500
Let's make this quick, huh?

11:49.500 --> 11:52.128
-I've got bingo tonight.
-(chuckles)

11:52.128 --> 11:53.755
ABIGAIL: Ask us
anything you want.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.798
Let's start with why
you destroyed

11:55.798 --> 11:58.134
private property on our land.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.720
We didn't intend
to destroy anything.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.764
But we had to stop
the Camarilla.

12:02.764 --> 12:07.727
I know I look good for my age,
but I'm too old for fairy tales.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.938
Unlike the U. S.,

12:09.938 --> 12:13.107
our people don't fall for that
Euro-Inquisition gobbledygook.

12:13.107 --> 12:16.027
Witches and non-witches
live in harmony here.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.820
There are no Camarilla among us.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.697
ABIGAIL: You're wrong.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.449
And we don't want you
to realize it too late,

12:21.449 --> 12:24.661
after they wreak havoc like they
did in India and Fort Salem.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.246
The only havoc we've seen

12:26.246 --> 12:28.957
was caused by you
and your ragtag friends.

12:28.957 --> 12:32.377
ADIL: We're telling the truth
about the Camarilla.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.754
They hunted my people
to near extinction.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.423
They hunted all of us.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.884
You're Tarim.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.387
My heart breaks for you
and your people.

12:42.387 --> 12:45.515
PAULINE: Still, we have a treaty
to uphold.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.016
And your government seems
to think

12:47.016 --> 12:49.602
that you assassinated
President Wade.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.688
-Which is a lie.
-We know that.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.940
Our Marshal was holding you
when it happened.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.484
I'm more interested
in why they think that.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.820
Blanton Silver.

12:58.820 --> 13:03.408
He's Camarilla, now,
the leader of the free world.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.994
First he blamed us
for his daughter's death

13:05.994 --> 13:07.829
and now Wade?

13:07.829 --> 13:10.832
He's using us
to stoke hate against witches.

13:10.832 --> 13:14.836
The Camarilla don't care
about borders or treaties.

13:14.836 --> 13:17.213
And they're an enemy
to all witches,

13:17.213 --> 13:19.173
those in the Cession included.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.884
THELMA: If that's true, then
you're the ones responsible

13:21.884 --> 13:24.804
for bringing them
right to our front door.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.849
All the more reason to send you
back in a big red box

13:27.849 --> 13:30.101
with a big red ribbon around it.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.984
No, no, no,
you got to broil 'em frozen.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.820
That way they stay tender
in the middle.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.114
You gotta rethink
everything you know about cod.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.287
We heard you were special.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.708
You look like any other witch
to me.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.902
What are you doing?

14:20.902 --> 14:22.612
(dramatic music playing)

14:24.822 --> 14:26.491
(grunting)

14:31.662 --> 14:32.955
Stop!

14:53.643 --> 14:55.770
You've been holding out on me.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.814
I picked up a thing or two from
my time working with Scylla.

15:00.817 --> 15:01.901
(grunts)

15:04.445 --> 15:06.906
(tense music playing)

15:19.836 --> 15:21.712
(fire scorching)

15:24.757 --> 15:26.342
(inhales)

15:33.599 --> 15:36.477
TALLY: The Great War
with the Camarilla isn't coming,

15:36.477 --> 15:38.020
it's already here.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.730
We know how to fight them.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.399
We can help you fight them, too.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.818
(scoffs)
We don't need you to save us.

15:43.818 --> 15:47.697
MILLY: I think they're asking us
to save them, cousin.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.740
And if what
they're saying is true,

15:49.740 --> 15:53.161
then sending them back to the US
is a death sentence.

15:53.161 --> 15:56.289
THELMA: So what, we risk war
with America for harboring them?

15:56.289 --> 15:59.041
MILLY:
Who said anything about war?

15:59.041 --> 16:03.129
Oh, you always jump to the worst
possible conclusion, Bearkiller.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.756
And you always jump
to the easiest, cousin.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.968
PAULINE: It appears that
we are no longer in agreement

16:08.968 --> 16:11.053
about extraditing the fugitives.

16:11.053 --> 16:15.099
I suggest
that we call a new vote.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.977
Please wait outside
while we deliberate.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.896
You'll have
our decision shortly.

16:22.023 --> 16:23.524
Forgive me,

16:23.524 --> 16:25.109
but it seems
like you're debating

16:25.109 --> 16:26.360
whether to have us extradited

16:26.360 --> 16:28.196
or allowed to be sheltered here

16:28.196 --> 16:30.072
and I have another option
for you to consider.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.033
What are you doing?

16:32.033 --> 16:33.117
Trust me.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.746
My parents were Dodgers,

16:36.746 --> 16:38.664
so we were always on the move.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.209
And when we needed
a safe place to hide,

16:41.209 --> 16:43.586
the Cession welcomed us.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.588
The best years of my childhood
were spent here.

16:46.964 --> 16:49.300
Honestly, it's the closest thing
to a home I ever had

16:50.509 --> 16:52.762
until I found my true home,

16:52.762 --> 16:57.016
the woman I love
who is also from the Cession.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.645
It breaks my heart that we
brought our problems here,

17:00.645 --> 17:02.271
to this place
that has given me so much.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.734
If you let us go and help us
get out of the Cession,

17:06.734 --> 17:08.361
we will leave immediately.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.446
Where would you go?

17:10.446 --> 17:13.616
California,
it's where I grew up.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.534
We'll consider your request.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.120
Please wait outside.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.998
(dramatic music playing)

17:26.087 --> 17:28.965
(tense music playing)

17:40.393 --> 17:42.019
You'll be safe here.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.579
Is traveling
in this place always so...

17:59.579 --> 18:01.247
unsettling?

18:01.247 --> 18:03.332
No.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.084
It feels less
and less each time.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.008
Hello.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.137
Are you another shepherd?

18:16.137 --> 18:19.682
No. My name is Khalida.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.309
Oh.

18:21.309 --> 18:23.894
I was hoping
you were another shepherd.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.521
Sorry to disappoint you.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.358
What is this place?

18:29.358 --> 18:30.401
This?

18:32.445 --> 18:34.155
This is where I grew up.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.544
Why did you bring us here?

18:48.544 --> 18:51.505
While I find
the remaining stewards,

18:51.505 --> 18:53.049
I need to keep you all safe.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.013
This was the last place where
I knew what that felt like.

19:03.351 --> 19:06.395
My sister and I
were about your age

19:06.395 --> 19:09.148
when our mother taught us
to sew right over there.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.528
And we used to sing
to our father

19:14.528 --> 19:16.238
after dinner by the fire.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.534
Our family was happy here.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.167
And that,

19:31.003 --> 19:34.965
that's where our parents
were murdered by the Camarilla.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.885
After that day,
any thoughts of sewing

19:37.885 --> 19:39.345
and singing were behind me.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.807
I needed to make sure we lived,

19:44.266 --> 19:45.685
so we ran,

19:48.729 --> 19:51.148
and life was never
the same again.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.238
Every Spring,

19:57.238 --> 19:59.156
my brother would take me high
into the mountains

20:00.574 --> 20:03.577
to see the snowdrop
flowers bloom.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.955
It was what I most
looked forward to each year.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.292
I loved how strange
and beautiful they looked,

20:10.292 --> 20:11.919
the way they fought
their way up

20:11.919 --> 20:13.170
through the snow
to reach the light.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.088
Hmm.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.258
One Spring,

20:17.258 --> 20:19.135
as we'd done many times before,

20:21.762 --> 20:24.223
we left our parents
to go see them.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.892
And when we returned,

20:26.892 --> 20:29.311
they had been killed.

20:29.311 --> 20:32.773
There was no time to grieve them
because in that moment,

20:32.773 --> 20:34.150
I became our people's leader.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.154
(sobbing)

20:38.154 --> 20:40.030
I know something of your pain.

20:42.366 --> 20:46.328
They burned this house
in the name of their god,

20:46.328 --> 20:49.331
and drove us from here.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.376
New shores proved
just as dangerous.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.629
These moments could have
destroyed us,

20:55.629 --> 20:57.339
but they did not.

20:57.339 --> 21:01.218
And we need not endure
this pain alone.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.597
We are stronger together.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.307
We've come a long way.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.184
Uh-huh.

21:08.184 --> 21:09.518
We're survivors.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.480
It was only a matter of time

21:12.480 --> 21:14.315
before we earned
each other's trust,

21:14.315 --> 21:15.983
sister.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.239
(dramatic music playing)

21:35.336 --> 21:37.755
We've come to a decision.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.840
You will be allowed
to leave the Cession

21:39.840 --> 21:44.220
and we will give you whatever
resources you'll need to do so.

21:44.220 --> 21:49.058
But none of you
can return here ever.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.310
That is the condition
of your freedom.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.354
And before you ask,

21:53.354 --> 21:56.232
yes, this decision applies

21:56.232 --> 21:58.234
to Raelle Collar as well.

22:06.367 --> 22:08.035
How's it going in there?

22:08.035 --> 22:09.787
We're a little busy.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.247
How about in here?

22:13.082 --> 22:14.625
You're gonna be okay.

22:14.625 --> 22:17.002
I'm gonna get you out of here.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.879
(muffled screaming)

22:18.879 --> 22:21.131
Looks like it was quite a party.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.217
Sorry I missed it.

22:23.217 --> 22:25.135
We got a lot
of good stuff though.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.971
We're getting deeper
into the sub-sonics.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.514
Should be able to update
our newest modules.

22:28.514 --> 22:31.141
Impressive.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.602
Alban's implant is already
better than the modules.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.189
I worry about him.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.401
Me, too.

22:40.401 --> 22:43.362
Could you imagine putting
their flesh in your body?

22:45.072 --> 22:46.240
The man's a hero.

22:47.825 --> 22:50.411
He'll make any sacrifice
to cleanse the world of them.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.915
(choking)

22:54.915 --> 22:56.333
ANACOSTIA: Now you're gonna
show us the way out of here.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.171
(footsteps approaching)

23:09.430 --> 23:11.307
This is so terrible.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.310
You seem like good kids.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.688
I was in your corner.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.273
Remember that.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.817
Their corner?

23:21.817 --> 23:23.360
What about the Sioux
who elected you?

23:27.323 --> 23:29.366
Mind your own business, Thelma.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.080
I'm in charge of getting
you safely across our border.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.790
Wonderful.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.001
Not my idea of a good time
either, soldier.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.255
Me and my guards will be
on the grounds tonight.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.465
We leave in the morning.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.342
The wards will be going back up,

23:46.342 --> 23:48.510
in case anyone
feels like running,

23:48.510 --> 23:52.014
and... you'll have
to wear these.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.224
Are those really necessary?

23:54.224 --> 23:56.143
We're not criminals.

23:56.143 --> 23:59.480
Yeah. Well, I'm not as trusting

23:59.480 --> 24:01.065
as The Marshal.

24:05.903 --> 24:06.862
(chuckles)

24:12.785 --> 24:15.621
Wish it didn't have
to be this way.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.331
A couple of you were starting
to grow on me.

24:17.331 --> 24:20.334
(dramatic music playing)

24:29.176 --> 24:31.720
I really don't like her.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.347
I never would have
picked that up.

24:36.558 --> 24:37.434
(glass breaks)

24:38.811 --> 24:42.064
Damn. Sorry.

25:01.709 --> 25:04.461
(dramatic music playing)

25:27.401 --> 25:28.318
What is it?

25:29.445 --> 25:31.447
This isn't a win.

25:31.447 --> 25:32.948
Not even close.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.625
-We did our best.
-Did we?

25:43.625 --> 25:46.628
Because it seems like all we did
was save our own skins.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.964
We told them
about the Camarilla.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.424
We warned them.

25:50.424 --> 25:51.800
We couldn't even get them
to trust us,

25:51.800 --> 25:53.427
let alone believe
that the threat is real.

25:54.887 --> 25:58.015
My whole life has been about
training to be a soldier,

25:58.015 --> 25:59.433
protecting people.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.686
Then I think about
all the people

26:02.686 --> 26:04.688
that I've failed to protect,

26:04.688 --> 26:06.565
Charvel and Penelope.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.902
-And even Raelle.
-Hey.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.489
Raelle is not lost.

26:13.489 --> 26:14.656
(electricity buzzing)

26:14.656 --> 26:16.617
Do you hear that?

26:16.617 --> 26:18.619
What?

26:18.619 --> 26:20.662
A buzzing.

26:20.662 --> 26:25.375
(buzzing continues)

26:25.375 --> 26:27.336
Are you seriously telling me
you can't hear that?

26:30.422 --> 26:33.467
There! Hello?

26:33.467 --> 26:34.676
ANACOSTIA: You're gonna be okay.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.261
I'm gonna get you out of here.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.721
Anacostia?

26:37.721 --> 26:39.640
-Hello?
-(buzzing stops)

26:39.640 --> 26:41.725
What is she doing here?

26:41.725 --> 26:43.519
Maybe she and your mom
have a plan.

26:45.229 --> 26:46.647
Anacostia's downstairs.

26:46.647 --> 26:47.773
Come on.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.567
(tense music playing)

27:05.749 --> 27:07.417
Camarilla.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.086
Looks like Anacostia
got the drop on him.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.546
Well, then where is she?

27:15.759 --> 27:18.053
Sorry. Anacostia's not gonna
make it.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.140
Hey!

27:21.140 --> 27:22.850
(grunting, groaning)

27:29.690 --> 27:32.609
(panting)

27:35.279 --> 27:36.572
I'm sure there are
more of them nearby.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.743
We gotta get out
of this building.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.620
We can't get past the wards.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.497
Then we need to find a way
to get Thelma's attention.

27:53.630 --> 27:54.673
Thelma!

27:54.673 --> 27:56.592
Bearkiller! Open up!

27:56.592 --> 27:58.385
Maybe the wards block out
the sound, too.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.762
Or the Camarilla
already got her.

28:00.762 --> 28:03.473
We need to get control
of this situation before...

28:03.473 --> 28:10.439
SINGER: ♪ I could give away
that I feel ♪

28:10.439 --> 28:15.736
♪ But I won't be (indistinct) ♪

28:22.784 --> 28:24.620
♪ From above ♪

28:24.620 --> 28:31.001

28:32.169 --> 28:36.715
♪ Just like a dream ♪

28:36.715 --> 28:42.638
♪ To me ♪

28:44.723 --> 28:45.766
(laughs)

28:45.766 --> 28:48.018
(tense music playing)

28:52.940 --> 28:55.817
Abigail, I love what you've done
with your hair.

28:55.817 --> 28:58.111
I knew we should have killed you
when we had the chance.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.738
Let's not make
that mistake again.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.281
Agreed.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.408
"By the blast of God
they perish."

29:03.408 --> 29:06.203
(screaming)

29:07.955 --> 29:09.706
(chuckling)

29:16.797 --> 29:19.257
HEARST: "And by the breath
of his nostrils...

29:20.550 --> 29:22.844
are they consumed."

29:22.844 --> 29:24.513
(inhales)

29:24.513 --> 29:27.766
(screaming)

29:30.018 --> 29:32.062
(laughing)

29:32.062 --> 29:34.314
(groaning)

29:48.745 --> 29:51.540
-(insects chirping)
-(ominous music playing)

30:02.759 --> 30:03.885
Shit.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.494
Oh. (laughing)

30:29.494 --> 30:31.121
That can't be good.

30:31.121 --> 30:32.706
(laughing)

30:37.711 --> 30:39.421
So what do you think, girls?

30:39.421 --> 30:41.840
Can I join your little club?

30:43.216 --> 30:44.801
It can't be possible.

30:44.801 --> 30:46.386
I wasn't sure
it would work either,

30:46.386 --> 30:49.973
what with your kind's
impure blood.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.142
But it seems to have taken
hold nicely.

30:52.142 --> 30:53.018
You're sick.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.981
Sick? Brilliant?

31:00.067 --> 31:02.736
It just kind of depends on your
perspective, don't you think?

31:02.736 --> 31:03.987
(screams)

31:07.532 --> 31:09.951
HEARST: You might wanna say
your goodbyes, you two.

31:09.951 --> 31:13.205
Your little romance is about
to come to a tragic end.

31:15.373 --> 31:16.416
Let's hope it works.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.336
SCYLLA: Looks like you popped
a stitch there, doc.

31:23.465 --> 31:25.342
These old pipes'll
hold long enough.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.137
-(screams)
-(glass breaks)

31:32.057 --> 31:35.435
(screaming)

31:41.900 --> 31:42.818
My collar!

31:49.658 --> 31:50.784
I'll see you soon.

31:52.953 --> 31:54.079
I'm going after him!

31:56.248 --> 31:58.458
How long do we have
to stay here?

32:00.252 --> 32:02.587
It's impossible to say.
But the Mother will let...

32:02.587 --> 32:03.505
(thuds)

32:05.215 --> 32:07.092
My brother.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.426
I'll go.

32:08.426 --> 32:09.678
Stay with them.

32:15.934 --> 32:16.852
Thanks.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.563
He's gone.

32:19.563 --> 32:20.689
Now, do you understand
the lengths

32:20.689 --> 32:21.606
these people will go to kill us?

32:21.606 --> 32:22.566
All of us.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.444
And now they're gonna see
the lengths we'll go to

32:26.444 --> 32:27.988
to avenge spilled blood.

32:27.988 --> 32:30.073
HEARST: Sisters!

32:30.073 --> 32:34.035
Why don't you come
outside and play?

32:34.035 --> 32:36.413
There's something here
I think you really need to see.

32:36.413 --> 32:38.874
He did not just call us sisters.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.292
Let's put an end to this.

32:41.418 --> 32:43.837
(dramatic music playing)

32:48.466 --> 32:49.342
HEARST: There you are.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.388
You know it's rude to keep
your company waiting.

32:53.388 --> 32:56.391
-No more talking.
-I agree.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.351
(suspenseful music playing)

33:02.022 --> 33:02.939
Edwin!

33:04.232 --> 33:06.359
HEARST: You gave it
the old War College try,

33:06.359 --> 33:08.111
but all things must pass.

33:08.111 --> 33:10.322
Surrender now,
and I'll let Raelle's

33:10.322 --> 33:13.950
dear old daddy live.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.785
You have my word.

33:15.785 --> 33:17.913
And not so much as a syllable
from any of you.

33:17.913 --> 33:19.873
I'll do the singing tonight.

33:19.873 --> 33:21.666
Leave him out of this.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.793
HEARST: Normally, I shy away
from hurting humans,

33:23.793 --> 33:26.338
but I needed
some Witchbomb insurance,

33:26.338 --> 33:28.256
just in case Raelle
had recovered.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.177
I guess she didn't make it, huh?

33:32.177 --> 33:33.595
What's he talking about?

33:33.595 --> 33:35.013
Where's Raelle?

33:35.013 --> 33:36.806
Oh, he doesn't know?

33:37.974 --> 33:38.975
Oh.

33:38.975 --> 33:41.603
(laughing)

33:43.355 --> 33:45.190
Raelle got ahold
of a bad mushroom.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.484
-Poison, actually.
-Shut up, you bastard!

33:47.484 --> 33:49.444
Scylla?
What is he talking about?

33:49.444 --> 33:51.196
HEARST: She's dead.

33:51.196 --> 33:54.908
The spawn of your unnatural
alliance is gone.

33:56.076 --> 33:59.246
So, what's it gonna be?

33:59.246 --> 34:01.539
-Don't do it.
-I have to.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.166
Fine.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.876
Take me, but you let him go now.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.337
Oh, that is so sweet.

34:07.337 --> 34:09.256
But you misunderstand.

34:09.256 --> 34:11.216
I'm gonna need all of you
to surrender.

34:11.216 --> 34:13.468
Earth and Sky.

34:13.468 --> 34:15.595
The Ginger.

34:15.595 --> 34:16.638
Everyone.

34:18.932 --> 34:20.767
Kill them! Kill them all!

34:20.767 --> 34:22.435
-Hurt him!
-No, stop!

34:27.357 --> 34:29.276
(man screaming)

34:30.819 --> 34:32.195
It's not possible.

34:33.363 --> 34:36.032
(suspenseful music playing)

35:11.693 --> 35:13.278
It's okay. You're okay.

35:19.367 --> 35:21.036
His voice at the party.
The bandages.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.664
It all makes sense.

35:24.664 --> 35:25.957
And now we know what that
sick party was really for.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.794
What now?

35:29.794 --> 35:31.254
End of the line.

35:31.254 --> 35:32.589
I don't have the code
for this door.

35:34.215 --> 35:36.217
I guess you won't be needing
your hand.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.094
All right, all right, all right,
all right!

35:38.094 --> 35:39.679
(panting)

35:43.224 --> 35:45.352
I do this and you let me go,
right?

35:45.352 --> 35:47.729
You need to be worried about
what I'm gonna do if you don't.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.150
(beeping)

35:52.150 --> 35:53.276
(door opens)

35:55.403 --> 35:57.447
We'll decide what to do with you
once we get out of here.

36:01.618 --> 36:03.328
Hey.

36:05.288 --> 36:06.581
Don't even think about it.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.709
Hey! Hey!

36:17.467 --> 36:19.135
I guess he made the decision
for us.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.479
(crickets chirping)

36:29.479 --> 36:32.440
(panting)

36:36.319 --> 36:38.029
We need to know
what they're doing here.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.120
Yeah.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.089
-How does it look?
-SCYLLA: It's okay.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.757
-Yeah?
-Yeah, yeah. Don't worry.

36:57.757 --> 36:59.342
You were very brave back there.

37:00.969 --> 37:03.471
And a bit stupid.

37:03.471 --> 37:05.348
Well, when it comes
to the people I care about,

37:05.348 --> 37:07.434
I can be a bit of both.

37:07.434 --> 37:10.687
Hey, you really think Rae
is gonna be okay?

37:10.687 --> 37:12.439
She's alive.

37:12.439 --> 37:13.898
And we're gonna get her back.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.316
I promise you.

37:15.316 --> 37:17.861
(dramatic music playing)

37:22.407 --> 37:25.535
You all are mixed up
in some wild shit.

37:25.535 --> 37:27.287
Is every day like this for you?

37:27.287 --> 37:29.247
Pretty much.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.874
You still wanna kick us out
of the Cession?

37:32.917 --> 37:35.962
I should probably say yes,
but...

37:35.962 --> 37:38.173
we have a war to fight.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.340
And we're gonna have
to fight it together.

37:40.759 --> 37:43.470
And the first thing
we need to do

37:43.470 --> 37:45.346
is figure out how the Camarilla
knew you were here.

37:56.483 --> 37:58.318
Is this because of the poison
they're using

37:58.318 --> 37:59.444
against the mycelium?

38:04.449 --> 38:05.742
It's getting worse.

38:07.452 --> 38:09.245
So what does that mean
for Raelle?

38:16.961 --> 38:19.130
(panting) Alder!

38:19.130 --> 38:22.008
(dramatic music playing)

38:38.358 --> 38:41.236
(tense music playing)

38:56.167 --> 38:58.044
Goddess.

38:58.044 --> 39:00.880
MAN: Platoon, right turn!

39:03.424 --> 39:05.468
Left turn!

39:06.761 --> 39:08.304
March!

39:13.476 --> 39:15.854
Ten-hut (indistinct)

39:15.854 --> 39:19.065
(tense music playing)
