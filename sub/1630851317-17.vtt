Previously on <i>
Bob Hearts Abishola...</i>

00:04.700 --> 00:06.702
- <i>E kaale,</i> Mummy.
- What are you doing?

00:06.745 --> 00:08.834
- Studying.
- Where's dinner?

00:08.878 --> 00:10.010
I've not started it.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.012
- Bob will be home soon.
- He can wait.

00:14.536 --> 00:15.711
Oh, no.

00:15.754 --> 00:18.975
Another man is
going to divorce you.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.847
Fine, I'll stop studying
and start dinner.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.501
I did not say stop studying.

00:23.545 --> 00:24.676
You can read and stir

00:24.720 --> 00:27.070
- at the same time.
- What if I cannot?

00:27.114 --> 00:28.767
Then you will kill your mother
with shame.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.465
Ah-ah. Ebun.

00:30.508 --> 00:31.553
Where have you been?

00:31.596 --> 00:33.033
Uh, running errands.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.469
I came to see you.

00:34.512 --> 00:36.906
I have been waiting
nearly six hours.

00:36.949 --> 00:39.952
Check your phone next time, dear.

00:39.996 --> 00:41.998
For the love of God.

00:49.092 --> 00:50.180
Bob?

00:52.530 --> 00:53.879
Bob?

00:54.793 --> 00:55.751
Tunde?

00:55.794 --> 00:57.318
Where is your stepladder?

00:57.361 --> 00:58.841
What?

00:58.884 --> 01:01.278
I am here to paint
your mother-in-law's bedroom.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.064
What?

01:04.107 --> 01:06.892
I believe this means she is
staying through the summer.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.764
What?!

01:08.807 --> 01:10.418
Is this where
the party's at?

01:10.461 --> 01:12.637
No. We're sleeping.

01:12.681 --> 01:15.031
Then what's
everybody doing in here?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.728
I was just telling Bob

01:16.772 --> 01:18.556
I was looking
for his stepladder.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.993
- Why?
- To paint Ebun's bedroom.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.996
Oh, good! She decided to stay
through the summer.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.128
I found the ladder.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.391
- Ah. Wh-
- Where was it hiding?

01:27.435 --> 01:28.871
Kitchen pantry.

01:28.914 --> 01:31.482
Oh, uh, never mind, Bob.
We found the ladder.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.484
It was in the kitchen pantry.

01:35.443 --> 01:37.749
Get out.

01:37.793 --> 01:40.970
He's not
a morning person.

01:41.927 --> 01:43.581
Unbelievable.

01:43.625 --> 01:44.756
Shh!

01:44.800 --> 01:47.019
Oh, that's what woke you?

02:16.397 --> 02:19.008
Why didn't you tell me about
your mom redecorating?

02:19.051 --> 02:20.923
Because I did not know about it.

02:20.966 --> 02:23.317
Well, don't you think she should
run that stuff by us?

02:23.360 --> 02:26.668
I do, but she does not.

02:26.711 --> 02:28.887
Has she said anything about
when she might be leaving?

02:28.931 --> 02:31.629
- No.
- Well, could you ask her?

02:31.673 --> 02:33.283
No.

02:33.327 --> 02:34.763
That would be disrespectful,

02:34.806 --> 02:36.373
and she would think
I want her to go.

02:36.417 --> 02:38.288
But you do want her to go.

02:39.768 --> 02:42.292
Oh, you can't even say it,
can you?

02:43.902 --> 02:45.165
Well, maybe I'll talk to her.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.732
Okay.

02:47.776 --> 02:48.951
Why is that funny?

02:48.994 --> 02:50.126
I'll just find the right time

02:50.170 --> 02:51.736
and ask her
how long she's staying.

02:51.780 --> 02:54.652
You are kicking me out
of your home?

02:55.653 --> 02:57.873
Wow, you do that well.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.048
Answer me.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.223
Well, I'm just saying,
Mama Ebun,

03:00.267 --> 03:01.572
it's been weeks.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.879
I did not realize
you'd been marking the days

03:03.922 --> 03:06.142
like a prisoner
with chalk on the wall.

03:07.099 --> 03:09.145
Well, that's a little dramatic.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.626
How dare you
call me dramatic.

03:11.669 --> 03:14.411
I don't like this game anymore.

03:14.455 --> 03:16.021
I don't like being kicked out
of your house

03:16.065 --> 03:18.633
and onto the street like a dog.

03:18.676 --> 03:20.591
Okay, I'm done.

03:20.635 --> 03:23.246
You are done
when I say you are done!

03:23.290 --> 03:25.248
You're freaking me out!

03:28.686 --> 03:31.167
In our culture,
there's no respectful way

03:31.211 --> 03:34.126
to ask an elder
to leave your house.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.650
That's not just Nigerian.

03:35.693 --> 03:38.740
Family freeloaders are
an international dilemma.

03:38.783 --> 03:40.568
But your relatives overstay

03:40.611 --> 03:41.960
a couple of weeks.

03:42.004 --> 03:44.833
Ours stay for decades.

03:44.876 --> 03:46.704
So, you can never
get rid of 'em?

03:46.748 --> 03:48.315
Oh, there are ways.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.273
Devilish ways.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.057
Let me write this down.

03:52.101 --> 03:54.712
Okay, so, you get
a blow-up mattress.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.410
You stab it with a pin
in several spots.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.194
Not too big,
not too small.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.631
They cannot see it,
they cannot hear it.

04:00.675 --> 04:04.983
Buy... air... mattress.

04:05.027 --> 04:05.984
In the morning,

04:06.028 --> 04:07.638
they wake up flat on the floor

04:07.682 --> 04:09.597
in excruciating pain.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.816
That is how you make sciatica.

04:11.860 --> 04:15.124
- Make... sciatica.
- Mm-hmm.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.995
You could also try

04:17.039 --> 04:19.128
inappropriate nakedness.

04:19.171 --> 04:21.348
Is that why you kept leaving
your bathrobe open

04:21.391 --> 04:23.263
when I stayed with you
after my husband left?

04:23.306 --> 04:26.309
Yes, you were crying constantly.

04:26.353 --> 04:30.139
My naked breasts
helped you move on.

04:30.182 --> 04:32.576
I'm not exposing myself
to my mother.

04:32.620 --> 04:33.925
It doesn't have to be you.

04:33.969 --> 04:37.451
Bob is not exposing himself
to my mother.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.758
Then perhaps you can go
the dead ancestor route.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.934
Anybody naked in that?

04:42.978 --> 04:44.240
- Unfortunately, no.
- Hmm.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.111
Abishola calls her mother,

04:46.155 --> 04:48.026
pretending to be
a spirit from beyond.

04:48.070 --> 04:50.942
Guiding her with advice
like, "Get out,

04:50.986 --> 04:53.945
go home, get out."

04:54.816 --> 04:57.427
So Abishola's mother thinks
a ghost can use a phone?

04:57.471 --> 04:58.776
Why not?

04:58.820 --> 05:01.039
With unlimited minutes,
anything is possible.

05:02.258 --> 05:05.000
Your mother's mother
would be perfect.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.871
I agree.

05:06.915 --> 05:08.830
But I do not know what
my grandmother sounded like.

05:08.873 --> 05:11.572
That's your problem
with this plan?

05:17.360 --> 05:20.798
90% of a good paint job

05:20.842 --> 05:23.018
is proper preparation.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.541
Yes, Uncle.

05:24.585 --> 05:28.284
Failing to prepare
is preparing to fail.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.851
Yes, Uncle.

05:29.894 --> 05:33.637
Sex appeal is 50% what you got

05:33.681 --> 05:37.380
and 50% what they think you got.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.556
Uncle?

05:40.601 --> 05:42.994
Uh, once I turn
the wisdom spigot on,

05:43.038 --> 05:44.431
it's hard to turn off.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.215
Yes, Uncle.

05:46.258 --> 05:49.566
I know this is the last thing
you wanted to do today.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.568
It's not the last thing.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.396
But, Dele, you are lucky.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.180
You have successful,
loving parents,

05:55.224 --> 05:56.965
all the comforts of the world,

05:57.008 --> 06:00.055
and an uncle
who will not let you grow soft.

06:00.098 --> 06:01.404
I appreciate it, Uncle.

06:01.448 --> 06:04.625
Before the day is over,
that will not be a lie.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.278
There are four basic skills

06:06.322 --> 06:09.151
that every young man
should know.

06:09.194 --> 06:11.458
How to paint a room,
tie a tie,

06:11.501 --> 06:13.416
fix a flat, and give a toast.

06:14.635 --> 06:15.897
What about cook a meal?

06:15.940 --> 06:18.639
Unnecessary.
There are Wendy's everywhere.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.642
- Are we ready?
- Yes.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.295
Wrong.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.645
The most important part

06:24.688 --> 06:27.735
about doing anything right
is the music.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.307
♪ I said a hip-hop, a hippie

06:35.351 --> 06:37.614
♪ A hippie to the hip hip-hop,

- What?
- You can rap?

06:46.449 --> 06:49.974
Have you never heard me
in the shower, young man?

06:50.018 --> 06:54.022
Who is this?

06:54.065 --> 06:56.154
You do not know
The Sugarhill Gang?

06:56.198 --> 06:57.417
No, Uncle.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.114
What about Grandmaster Flash?

06:59.157 --> 07:00.681
I'm sorry, no.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.509
Eric B. and Rakim?

07:02.552 --> 07:04.032
Mm-mm.

07:04.075 --> 07:06.730
This painting can wait.

07:06.774 --> 07:10.604
Your musical education is
far more important.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.649
1979.

07:12.693 --> 07:16.392
Big Bank Hank, Wonder Mike
and Master Gee formed

07:16.436 --> 07:20.744

hip-hop to the world.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.417
Hey, guys.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.592
Do me a favor,

07:42.636 --> 07:44.551
step inside this square.

07:44.594 --> 07:46.030
Why?
Just do it.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.989
Is it a magic square?

07:48.032 --> 07:51.035
Stop making it weird
and get in the square.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.085
You guys think you could live
in something this size?

07:57.128 --> 07:59.217
If it's a room
to punish the workers,

07:59.261 --> 08:01.742
I'd make it much smaller.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.178
What? No.
I'm thinking about putting

08:03.221 --> 08:04.484
one of those tiny homes
in my backyard

08:04.527 --> 08:05.615
for my mother-in-law.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.443
Good, you're coming to terms

08:07.487 --> 08:08.879
that she will be
living with you forever.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.794
No, I just want her
outside the house

08:10.838 --> 08:12.492
for when she visits.

08:12.535 --> 08:13.667
So you're building
her a home?

08:13.710 --> 08:14.929
A tiny home.

08:14.972 --> 08:17.671
That she will
live in forever.

08:17.714 --> 08:20.282
Please stop saying "forever."

08:20.325 --> 08:23.067
We just want you to be
realistic, Mr. Wheeler.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.853
I live above Goodwin's garage,
and I am never leaving.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.463
And I have accepted that.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.682
The day he bought

08:28.725 --> 08:30.248
- the Wi-
- Fi extender,

08:30.292 --> 08:32.337
I knew we were in it
for the long haul.

08:33.338 --> 08:35.515
I was gonna buy
- the Wi-
- Fi extender.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.255
You see?

08:38.256 --> 08:39.780
How are you so okay with this?

08:39.823 --> 08:42.347
Simple. I am a Christian,
Mr. Wheeler.

08:42.391 --> 08:45.133
My good deeds will be rewarded
in the afterlife.

08:45.176 --> 08:47.004
We sometimes joke

08:47.048 --> 08:49.093
that I will live in the room
above his cloud in heaven.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.834
You make that joke,
I do not.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.229
Screw it.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.447
I-I can't build this.

08:55.491 --> 08:56.579
She'll never leave.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.538
I am telling you this
as a friend.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.888
Build the tiny house.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.193
Accept your fate.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.500
And maybe
when she's not using it,

09:04.544 --> 09:06.371
Kofo can stay there.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.548
What a wonderful idea.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.681
- Nope, nope, nope.
- Never.

09:11.725 --> 09:14.554
Nope, nope.
Not gonna happen, guys.

09:22.387 --> 09:25.303
Hello? Hello?

09:25.347 --> 09:30.178
Ebunoluwa Adebisi Odegbami.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.745
Ah-ah. Who is this?

09:35.487 --> 09:37.054
Who is this?

09:42.277 --> 09:43.757
Mummy?

09:44.801 --> 09:47.978
You have hooked the fish,
now reel her in.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.768
I am listening.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.250
But I do not want to leave.

10:02.689 --> 10:03.994
But I am not ready.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.345
But I do not think I am.

10:07.389 --> 10:09.130
Go home!

10:09.913 --> 10:11.393
Mummy?

10:14.744 --> 10:16.920
I just...

10:18.574 --> 10:20.620
...do not want to go
back to that man.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.845
No, he is just my husband.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.934
The love left many years ago.

10:33.110 --> 10:36.505
I try to be a good wife,
but how can I be?

10:36.548 --> 10:39.247
All I do is cook and clean
for a man

10:39.290 --> 10:41.292
who barely looks at me.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.208
Let alone touches me.

10:45.906 --> 10:49.039
It is like living
with a stranger.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.959
Ask her if she's taken
any lovers.

11:05.099 --> 11:08.537
She told me things a daughter
should never have to hear.

11:08.580 --> 11:11.192
That is the power
of the ghost call.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.847
But be careful, you should
only use this technique

11:13.890 --> 11:15.544
every five to seven years.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.938
Otherwise, people will think
you are a witch.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.984
Where have you been?

11:21.028 --> 11:24.858
Oh, just having a little
ghost mother-daughter time.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.511
Oh, no, you didn't.

11:26.555 --> 11:29.166
We did.
We did.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.907
I don't even want to know.

11:31.908 --> 11:34.171
But I want to know.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.217
She opened up
like a fire hydrant,

11:36.260 --> 11:39.046
and we danced in the mud puddle
of her secrets.

11:39.089 --> 11:42.223
So many secrets.

11:42.266 --> 11:45.052
How could I not have known
that my parents were so unhappy?

11:45.095 --> 11:47.576
Well, I'm sure they were just
shielding you from it

11:47.619 --> 11:49.099
so you didn't worry.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.187
Exactly.

11:50.231 --> 11:52.712
My husband and I
hated each other.

11:52.755 --> 11:55.366
But we scheduled sex
every six months

11:55.410 --> 11:57.760
just so our children
could overhear,

11:57.804 --> 12:00.328
because that is
what good parents do.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.896
Should I tell her I know?

12:02.939 --> 12:04.593
Of course not.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.943
You betrayed her trust
with your ghost trickery.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.730
Okay, my ghost trickery.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.035
I'm sorry, honey.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.602
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.560
- Understood.
- Of course.

12:15.604 --> 12:16.823
We will never speak of this again. No.

12:20.304 --> 12:23.655
- Tell me everything.
- Wait, let me get my notes.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.748
Unfortunately,
Kurtis Blow never had

12:28.791 --> 12:31.925
another hit quite as big
as "The Breaks," but,

12:31.968 --> 12:34.797
as he says,
"These are the breaks."

12:35.798 --> 12:37.408
I really like that song.

12:37.452 --> 12:40.368
Of course you do.
Everyone likes that song.

12:40.411 --> 12:43.110
But let us step into 1983.

12:43.153 --> 12:46.461
Here's one
from Miss Patti LaBelle.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.119
It's nice.

12:52.162 --> 12:53.947
Yes, it is.

12:53.990 --> 12:57.472
I can tell you the exact moment
I first heard this song.

12:57.515 --> 12:58.734
Really?

12:58.778 --> 13:01.476
Olu and I had just moved
into our apartment.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.826
She opened the window,

13:03.870 --> 13:07.351
and this song was playing
from someone else's apartment.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.529
We didn't have much furniture.

13:11.573 --> 13:14.881
Uh, w-we did not have
much of anything,

13:14.924 --> 13:17.492
but we had each other.

13:17.535 --> 13:20.147
So we danced.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.236
That's beautiful.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.109
That is the wonderful thing
about music.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.677
Songs can serve as
a time capsule

13:28.720 --> 13:31.462

of your life.

the nerve... ♪

13:33.508 --> 13:35.640

to paint a room with my uncle.

13:38.034 --> 13:41.603
No. This is mine and Olu's song.

15:03.293 --> 15:05.078
and all I had to do was
promise to love you forever,

15:05.121 --> 15:06.557
and I was gonna do that anyway.

15:08.124 --> 15:09.604
What have I done?

15:09.647 --> 15:11.954
Well, you married a sweetheart,
that's what you did.

I should never have involved
the ghost of her mother.

first thing in the morning.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.748
Yes, Mummy.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.794
Or maybe you could keep
some things here.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.578
Why?

15:27.622 --> 15:29.972
For when you come
back and visit.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.713
Just send the things.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.937
I am not looking forward
to this flight.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.635

15:41.679 --> 15:43.420

15:43.464 --> 15:45.248

15:45.292 --> 15:47.555
so it is what it is.

15:50.558 --> 15:51.994
You do not have to do this, Mummy.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.127
What are you talking about?

15:55.215 --> 15:57.782
Sometimes in life,
if you are unhappy with...

15:57.826 --> 16:00.002
"the middle seat,"

16:00.046 --> 16:02.178
it's okay to make a change.

16:04.398 --> 16:06.008
It is not that easy.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.532
I made a commitment.

16:08.576 --> 16:09.881
To the seat.

16:11.274 --> 16:16.279
But if you and the seat are
no longer right for each other.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.455
One does not just change seats.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.240
I did,

16:20.283 --> 16:22.546
and now I'm happier
than I've ever been.
