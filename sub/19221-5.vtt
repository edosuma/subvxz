00:16.596 --> 00:17.828
Geez!

00:19.482 --> 00:20.966
What the hell are you doing?

00:20.991 --> 00:24.223
Let me see, I was having a dream
about sharing a hammock with Beyoncé,

00:24.248 --> 00:26.444
then I got a face full of old man ass.

00:26.469 --> 00:27.833
No.

00:27.858 --> 00:30.926
No, I mean, what are you doing
here instead of your apartment?

00:30.928 --> 00:32.360
Did your roommate get lucky?

00:32.362 --> 00:33.248
Nope.

00:36.980 --> 00:38.867
The slump continues.

00:38.869 --> 00:41.403
We had no heat last
night; the landlord says

00:41.405 --> 00:43.705
they're "waiting for parts,"
but we know that's BS.

00:43.707 --> 00:44.728
Yeah, they're trying to make us leave

00:44.753 --> 00:47.275
so they can convert those
apartments into luxury condos.

00:47.277 --> 00:49.744
Yeah. They haven't picked
up the garbage in two weeks.

00:49.746 --> 00:52.098
The cockroaches and the
rats couldn't be happier.

00:53.349 --> 00:54.458
It's vermin utopia.

00:54.483 --> 00:56.294
Worst Pixar movie ever.

00:57.054 --> 00:58.687
Maybe you better think about moving.

00:58.689 --> 01:00.255
To where? With all the rich people

01:00.257 --> 01:02.357
moving to uptown, there
ain't nothing we can afford.

01:02.359 --> 01:04.959
I'll tell you what, uh, Franco,
you can have my guest bed,

01:04.962 --> 01:08.715
and, Sweatpants, you can sleep
on the couch where Joanie died.

01:09.743 --> 01:11.110
So it's broken in.

01:11.934 --> 01:13.001
We got to get ready
for work. And thank you.

01:13.003 --> 01:15.251
But we're not moving out.
We got a year and a half left

01:15.276 --> 01:17.806
on our lease, and you know me,
I ain't leaving without a fight.

01:17.808 --> 01:18.719
You're gonna freeze to death.

01:18.721 --> 01:19.786
We'll just buy a space heater.

01:19.811 --> 01:21.266
Or maybe cuddle for warmth.

01:22.555 --> 01:24.014
That is not happening, Sweatpants.

01:24.016 --> 01:25.782
Hate to break it to
you, but since you keep

01:25.784 --> 01:27.756
falling asleep first,
you don't get a vote.

01:38.551 --> 01:39.763
Hey, what's all that?

01:39.765 --> 01:42.098
I'm applying to become a sergeant.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.234
I really need the extra money.

01:44.236 --> 01:46.169
My daughter got into Northwestern.

01:46.171 --> 01:48.338
Northwestern? Congratulations.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.839
Eh.

01:50.532 --> 01:51.832
Now I can pay a hundred grand

01:51.834 --> 01:54.301
to have her take mushrooms and
sleep around with a lot of guys.

01:57.259 --> 02:00.246
Which she could do at home for free.

02:02.371 --> 02:04.878
- Oh, crap!
- What?

02:04.880 --> 02:08.513
It says I need a recommendation
from a current or former partner.

02:08.538 --> 02:11.337
So? There are a lot of people
you could ask. Seamus McGee.

02:11.645 --> 02:14.345
Liam O'Reilly. Paddy McGillicuddy.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.939
Why do all Irish cops
sound like sports bars?

02:18.329 --> 02:20.279
Yeah, but none of those
guys really liked me.

02:20.304 --> 02:22.489
They all thought I was too mean.

02:22.514 --> 02:23.990
Especially the fat ones.

02:25.365 --> 02:26.253
What are you gonna do?

02:26.622 --> 02:28.728
Well, if I want a good recommendation,

02:28.753 --> 02:30.920
I'm just gonna have to
start being nicer to James.

02:30.922 --> 02:32.021
Oh-ho.

02:32.023 --> 02:34.090
What? I can do it.

02:34.092 --> 02:37.188
Arthur, I dropped my
glasses in the urinal again.

02:38.039 --> 02:39.806
God help me.

02:40.188 --> 02:43.199
Then I hit my head when I bent
down to pick them up, and the...

02:43.201 --> 02:45.152
You know what? I forgot to pee.

02:53.037 --> 02:53.818
Oh, look.

02:53.843 --> 02:57.010
Somebody hearts his grandma.

02:57.041 --> 02:59.474
They've been renovating the laundry
room in our building for a month,

02:59.499 --> 03:01.663
so now we're down to our
back-of-the-closet clothes.

03:02.547 --> 03:05.515
And you're damn right
I heart my grandma.

03:05.810 --> 03:08.418
Actually, I'm kind of
loving these dress pants.

03:08.420 --> 03:09.630
They make me feel dignified.

03:09.655 --> 03:12.321
Like the king of
England. Or Steve Harvey.

03:12.323 --> 03:15.915
The landlord's trying to push us out

03:15.940 --> 03:18.048
so he can turn the
building into fancy condos.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.048
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.376
Greedy developers only
ever care about profits,

03:21.415 --> 03:22.945
never about people.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.837
Is there anything
that doesn't upset you?

03:24.839 --> 03:26.305
You're rich, you're white, you're young.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.763
You won, baby. Take a lap.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.177
Just got to find out
who owns the building.

03:32.179 --> 03:33.312
Some new corporation bought it,

03:33.314 --> 03:35.014
and I can't get them
to answer the phone.

03:35.016 --> 03:36.282
Well, what's the company called?

03:36.284 --> 03:37.283
Coffee, please.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.651
Chicago Property Holdings.

03:38.653 --> 03:41.220
Well, I'm off.

03:41.222 --> 03:45.128
They own several businesses,
including a dry cleaners,

03:45.153 --> 03:49.261
and the owner's name is Fawz
Hamadani Farooq Al-Shahrani.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.764
What? That's a very common name.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.545
In Iraq, it's like Bob.

03:56.237 --> 03:58.537
S-So you're the one
trying to push me out?

03:58.539 --> 04:00.439
Fawz, you can't do that to Franco.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.675
Yeah. You can't put
him out on the streets.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.443
Look at those dimples.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.354
He'll never survive.

04:06.268 --> 04:08.417
Well, in my defense, I
didn't know he lived there.

04:08.442 --> 04:10.516
All right, great. So
now you can back off.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.051
I can, but I won't.

04:12.053 --> 04:14.486
In three months, I'm gonna
turn that pile of crap

04:14.488 --> 04:16.288
into high-end luxury lofts.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.490
And what about the tenants
who can't pay triple the rent?

04:18.492 --> 04:20.692
I've already thought of
that... They will be replaced

04:20.695 --> 04:22.527
by tenants who <i>can</i>
pay triple the rent.

04:24.042 --> 04:24.931
Well, you know something?

04:24.956 --> 04:26.598
I'm not moving to some
dangerous-ass neighborhood

04:26.600 --> 04:28.434
and taking three busses to work.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.802
Busses are fun.

04:29.804 --> 04:32.438
♪ The wheels on the bus
go round and round. ♪

04:32.440 --> 04:35.641
♪ And the bullets near the
bus go zing, zing, zing. ♪

04:35.643 --> 04:38.477
What I'm doing is perfectly
legal. It's just business.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.573
That doesn't mean it's right!

04:39.598 --> 04:41.980
Hey, there's no fighting in my shop!

04:41.982 --> 04:43.549
Superior Donuts is a place

04:43.551 --> 04:45.651
that people come to
have fun, and eat a donut

04:45.653 --> 04:47.986
and talk about the cops,
or how Walter Payton

04:47.988 --> 04:51.023
was the NFL rushing leader in 1985.

04:51.025 --> 04:52.858
I believe it was Marcus Allen.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.316
What, are you crazy? Walter Payton!

04:54.341 --> 04:55.690
No, it wasn't. I'll look it up.

04:55.715 --> 04:57.296
No one's looking it up!

04:57.298 --> 04:59.118
Now, you see? That's fun.

05:00.234 --> 05:01.300
Fine.

05:01.302 --> 05:02.301
But this ain't over.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.635
And I ain't taking this lying down.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.437
That's right! When Franco takes it,

05:05.439 --> 05:07.063
he takes it standing up.

05:08.829 --> 05:09.930
Not helping, man.

05:11.649 --> 05:13.827
Well, however you like to take it...

05:15.046 --> 05:16.281
there's nothing you can do.

05:16.283 --> 05:19.740
Oh, yeah? Well, you know what,
what if I organized a protest?

05:19.765 --> 05:21.379
Me and the other tenants
can make a little noise,

05:21.404 --> 05:22.513
let the world know what you're doing.

05:22.538 --> 05:24.746
A protest? Hey, let's
not get carried away.

05:24.771 --> 05:26.125
Yeah, I can picket right in front of

05:26.127 --> 05:27.292
your dry cleaners, right next door.

05:27.294 --> 05:30.629
But that is my most profitable business.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.449
I know.

05:34.824 --> 05:36.101
Franco, let me help.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.203
I'm part of a campus group
that protests every weekend.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.571
How do you want to do this?

05:39.573 --> 05:41.707
Should we nude it up and
chain ourselves to a fence?

05:41.709 --> 05:45.110
N-Nah. I was thinking
just a march with signs.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.012
Nude march with signs?

05:47.947 --> 05:49.702
Just-just think about it.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.917
If you want some picketing tips,

05:51.919 --> 05:53.318
we had some pretty tough strikes

05:53.320 --> 05:54.787
down at the factory.

05:54.789 --> 05:57.656
Make sure you've got
plenty of petroleum jelly.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.712
What for?

05:58.737 --> 05:59.884
To coat your body.

05:59.909 --> 06:02.428
That way, if the cops grab
you, you just squirt right out.

06:05.231 --> 06:08.807
No! Nobody is nude-ing
or coating or squirting.

06:09.706 --> 06:10.836
I'm gonna settle this thing right now.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.205
Now, both of you, sit down. Sit down.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.706
All right.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.476
Now, both of you got to
just state your demands,

06:17.478 --> 06:18.977
then we'll work it out, all right?

06:18.979 --> 06:20.078
Franco, you go first.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.647
Fine. I want to live

06:21.649 --> 06:23.248
in an apartment building that has heat,

06:23.250 --> 06:25.317
a working elevator, a-and a guarantee

06:25.319 --> 06:27.639
that my rent won't double
once my lease is up.

06:27.665 --> 06:29.432
Fawz, your response?

06:29.457 --> 06:31.589
Uh...

06:31.614 --> 06:32.895
no!

06:33.559 --> 06:34.593
Time to picket!

06:34.595 --> 06:36.891
All right, look, just make
sure that you keep it civil.

06:36.916 --> 06:39.097
This is a protest, not a riot.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.466
A riot? Ooh!

06:40.468 --> 06:42.434
I'm gonna get to wear my riot gear.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.999
I'm gonna go home and polish my helmet.

06:44.124 --> 06:46.038
Oh, my God, James.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.707
Northwestern, not cheap.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.044
That is a great idea.

06:52.046 --> 06:54.179
You are gonna look so cool.

06:54.220 --> 06:55.425
All right!

06:57.183 --> 06:58.817
Yeah, you better watch out, Fawz.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.285
♪ We gonna kick your ass. ♪

07:00.287 --> 07:01.353
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

07:01.355 --> 07:03.522
Do you heart your
grandma with that mouth?

07:03.524 --> 07:06.525
Yeah, he does! He loves
his grandma with that mouth

07:06.527 --> 07:07.582
all night long!

07:08.543 --> 07:10.863
You got to stop backing me up, man.

07:16.574 --> 07:18.375
- What do we want?!
- Affordable housing!

07:18.377 --> 07:20.144
- When do we want it?!
- Now!

07:20.146 --> 07:22.179
- What do we want?!
- Affordable housing!

07:22.181 --> 07:24.114
- When do we want it?!
- Now!

07:24.116 --> 07:25.749
Isn't he inspiring?

07:25.751 --> 07:28.018
Yeah. And you never said he was so cute.

07:28.020 --> 07:29.052
Back off, Amanda!

07:29.054 --> 07:30.287
Can I have a try?

07:30.289 --> 07:31.555
Yeah.

07:31.557 --> 07:33.757
Hey, girl! Hey, shorty in the red.

07:33.759 --> 07:35.492
You got a boyfriend?

07:35.494 --> 07:36.894
You want one?

07:36.896 --> 07:39.062
Sorry, ma'am! Keep walking!

07:39.064 --> 07:42.010
Sweatpants can't love a woman
until he learns to love himself!

07:43.932 --> 07:46.537
Come on, Arthur. Join us,
dude. We got plenty of signs.

07:46.539 --> 07:48.172
I told you, kid, I
don't like these things.

07:48.174 --> 07:49.806
I'm not getting involved.

07:49.808 --> 07:51.208
Oh.

07:51.210 --> 07:53.443
What, you on Fawz's side now?

07:53.445 --> 07:55.145
I don't pick sides. I'm neutral.

07:55.147 --> 07:56.547
Oh, so you're like Switzerland,

07:56.549 --> 07:58.615
with your cheese and your wooden shoes

07:58.617 --> 08:01.586
and your leaning towers and I
should've researched this first,

08:01.611 --> 08:03.177
but you could be more supportive!

08:04.723 --> 08:06.590
I don't know, Arthur. Sometimes I think

08:06.592 --> 08:08.725
it's worth protesting
for what you believe in.

08:08.727 --> 08:11.328
I remember once
canvassing neighborhoods,

08:11.330 --> 08:12.629
manning the phones.

08:12.631 --> 08:13.463
Did it work?

08:13.465 --> 08:14.965
Well, the McRib came back,

08:14.967 --> 08:16.600
- so you tell me.
- Oh.

08:16.602 --> 08:18.435
They're just wasting their time.

08:18.437 --> 08:20.737
If people had a problem
with a ruthless businessman,

08:20.739 --> 08:22.533
we'd have a different
president right now.

08:23.175 --> 08:27.201
Fawz, I'm gonna miss you
when America's great again.

08:30.521 --> 08:32.982
Ma'am, do you really want
to give your money to a man

08:32.985 --> 08:35.686
who's displacing longtime
residents of this neighborhood?

08:36.035 --> 08:37.503
All right! Yeah!

08:37.990 --> 08:39.289
That's right!

08:39.291 --> 08:41.924
Oh, no! Don't chase her away!

08:41.927 --> 08:44.828
She's my best customer...
Sloppy eater, very sweaty.

08:44.830 --> 08:47.397
- What do we want?!
- Affordable housing!

08:47.399 --> 08:49.299
Yeah, yeah, I know what you want.

08:49.301 --> 08:51.168
Susan, come back!

08:52.856 --> 08:54.694
I feel I may be overdressed.

08:56.062 --> 08:57.741
No.

08:57.743 --> 08:59.343
Better safe than sorry.

08:59.345 --> 09:01.845
Besides, you look great.

09:01.847 --> 09:03.180
Really?

09:03.182 --> 09:04.544
'Cause I feel like a superhero.

09:04.569 --> 09:06.016
Oh, yeah.

09:06.018 --> 09:08.218
You totally look like a superhero.

09:09.188 --> 09:11.832
Whose superpower is never getting laid.

09:13.491 --> 09:16.927
- What was that?
- I said you look like Iron Man!

09:18.329 --> 09:21.476
I'm here with protest
leader Franco Wicks.

09:21.507 --> 09:22.960
Tell us what's going on.

09:22.985 --> 09:24.968
We're fighting the forces of
greed that are trying to push

09:24.970 --> 09:26.470
people out who have lived
here their whole lives.

09:26.472 --> 09:28.505
Namely this man, Fawz Al-Shahrani!

09:31.310 --> 09:34.678
Mr. Al-Shahrani, care to
comment on these accusations?

09:34.680 --> 09:38.533
Uh, of course Mr. Wicks
is entitled to his opinion,

09:38.558 --> 09:42.486
and of course there's no
such thing as bad press.

09:42.488 --> 09:45.022
And for a good press, come
to America Dry Cleaning,

09:45.024 --> 09:47.356
where all shirts are
two-for-one on Thursdays.

09:47.381 --> 09:49.676
This does not include blouses.

09:50.567 --> 09:52.362
So you're just going
to ignore the protesters

09:52.364 --> 09:53.530
until they go away?

09:53.532 --> 09:54.865
No. That is not gonna happen.

09:54.867 --> 09:56.366
I don't care how long it takes!

09:56.368 --> 09:57.834
We're not gonna fold!

09:59.471 --> 10:01.538
You don't have to fold.
At America Dry Cleaning,

10:01.540 --> 10:03.622
we do it for you, free of charge.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.209
Do you worry that this
is going to escalate

10:06.211 --> 10:08.478
into some kind of altercation?

10:08.480 --> 10:10.714
Uh, I don't know about altercation,

10:10.716 --> 10:12.716
but I do know about alterations.

10:12.718 --> 10:14.685
Ten percent off with every order.

10:14.687 --> 10:17.087
Listen here, Fawz, people
came here for the truth.

10:17.089 --> 10:20.023
And the truth is you're putting
poor people out on the streets.

10:20.025 --> 10:22.793
Uh...

10:23.628 --> 10:26.323
I got nothing. Back to you, Paul!

10:29.500 --> 10:31.301
Good morning!

10:31.303 --> 10:32.736
Do you recognize this
dude from the news?

10:32.738 --> 10:34.671
- What do we want?
- Franco...

10:34.673 --> 10:36.406
- When do we want him?
- Franco...

10:36.408 --> 10:37.908
No, you're supposed to
say "now," but it's okay.

10:37.910 --> 10:39.109
I'll try it again. What do we want?

10:39.111 --> 10:40.610
- Franco!
- What?

10:40.612 --> 10:42.273
I need you to see something.

10:42.858 --> 10:44.314
Okay.

10:45.277 --> 10:48.322
Man, yesterday felt so good, you know?

10:48.347 --> 10:49.319
Like if you stand up for something,

10:49.321 --> 10:51.588
you can actually make
the world a better place.

10:51.590 --> 10:53.000
What?

10:57.982 --> 10:59.367
_

11:01.423 --> 11:03.524
So you arrived at 4:15 this morning.

11:03.526 --> 11:05.093
Did you see anyone suspicious?

11:05.095 --> 11:07.161
No. Oh, my God.

11:07.163 --> 11:09.230
You know, Fawz can be a jerk sometimes,

11:09.232 --> 11:11.399
but nobody deserves that.

11:11.401 --> 11:13.902
"Arab Go Home"?

11:13.904 --> 11:16.905
Randy, I don't want to
tell you how to do your job,

11:16.907 --> 11:20.408
but I think this one might
be racially motivated.

11:23.412 --> 11:25.213
Man, this is all my fault.

11:25.215 --> 11:26.848
What are you talking about?

11:26.850 --> 11:29.484
You don't think one of the
protesters did this, do you?

11:29.486 --> 11:33.394
No, but... I put all that heat on Fawz,

11:33.456 --> 11:35.385
and that obviously
stirred up some nutjob,

11:35.410 --> 11:37.825
who saw it on the news,
that I brought here.

11:37.827 --> 11:40.028
So, Randy, you think you
can find out who did it?

11:40.030 --> 11:41.696
James is checking the
neighborhood to see

11:41.698 --> 11:44.232
if anyone saw anything
on their security cams.

11:44.234 --> 11:45.934
How's it going with you and James?

11:45.936 --> 11:48.703
He's a dork, and he couldn't
find his way to a vagina

11:48.705 --> 11:51.127
if he was the foreman
in a vagina factory.

11:53.806 --> 11:55.276
Thanks for asking.

11:55.649 --> 11:56.649
Hey, I have an idea.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.907
Let's show Fawz that the
neighborhood is behind him.

11:58.931 --> 12:01.082
We could hold a unity
rally outside of his shop.

12:01.107 --> 12:04.223
No. I mean, I hate what
happened to Fawz, but...

12:05.957 --> 12:07.288
my protesting days are over.

12:07.313 --> 12:10.089
Uh-uh. Kid. No, kid.

12:10.113 --> 12:11.658
Don't put this on yourself.

12:11.683 --> 12:13.526
There's no way you could've
known that this was gonna happen.

12:13.910 --> 12:14.963
Except that you tried to warn me.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.108
You said this would end badly,
remember? And you were right.

12:20.769 --> 12:22.462
Poor Franco.

12:23.431 --> 12:25.423
So, this vagina factory...

12:27.197 --> 12:28.743
... do you know if they're hiring?

12:29.848 --> 12:30.630
I'm, uh...

12:30.872 --> 12:32.997
I'm willing to take an
entry-level position.

12:36.036 --> 12:37.919
I got to do something about this.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.254
Well, I didn't find anything
on the security camera.

12:40.839 --> 12:43.284
But I did see myself
on the news last night.

12:43.448 --> 12:45.079
Why didn't you tell me
I looked like an idiot?

12:45.104 --> 12:47.295
What? I thought you looked dashing.

12:47.297 --> 12:48.763
Oh, cut the crap, okay?

12:48.765 --> 12:51.773
I looked like a cross between a
Power Ranger and a Ninja Turtle.

12:53.013 --> 12:55.269
Those are two of your favorite toys.

12:55.271 --> 12:57.302
They're not toys if
they stay in the box!

12:59.111 --> 13:01.828
Okay, look, I'm applying
to be a sergeant,

13:01.853 --> 13:03.945
and I need you to give
me a good recommendation.

13:03.947 --> 13:06.681
So I was trying not
to say anything mean.

13:06.683 --> 13:09.250
What kind of recommendation
did you think I would give you?

13:09.815 --> 13:12.553
Well, I've been known
to give you a hard time.

13:12.823 --> 13:15.166
I could start with your brutal honesty.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.791
But I could also tell them
that you're a great cop

13:17.994 --> 13:18.926
and an even better person.

13:19.439 --> 13:21.134
I think you'd make an amazing sergeant.

13:22.759 --> 13:24.232
Thank you.

13:26.001 --> 13:29.089
They need the recommendation
by next Friday.

13:29.114 --> 13:33.060
Oh. So you have to be nice
to me until next Friday.

13:35.344 --> 13:36.687
Uh-huh.

13:37.570 --> 13:39.914
So do you want to hear
the Batman origin story

13:39.916 --> 13:41.682
or the Spider-Man origin story?

13:42.851 --> 13:44.787
I'm just kidding. You're
gonna hear them both.

13:44.812 --> 13:46.000
So...

13:53.841 --> 13:55.332
What?

13:55.357 --> 13:57.498
I just want to show you a few
things from my protesting days.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.902
Oh, yeah? Mr. I'm Not Getting
Involved was a protester?

14:00.904 --> 14:02.603
Yeah, actually. Yes.

14:02.605 --> 14:04.806
Here. My old jacket.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.962
You know, back in the day, this
was considered out of sight.

14:07.987 --> 14:09.020
Oh.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.869
Well, it's nice to see you didn't
always dress like a lesbian.

14:14.152 --> 14:17.612
- Just tell your story.
- All right, all right. It was 1964.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.011
Lot of us were inspired

14:19.036 --> 14:22.104
by a man by the name of
Martin Luther King Jr.

14:22.364 --> 14:24.464
I'm familiar.

14:24.715 --> 14:25.832
My friends and I

14:25.864 --> 14:28.215
went on a few local
civil rights marches.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.628
Well, one day, we heard that there was

14:29.653 --> 14:31.881
gonna be this big protest
over in Grant Park.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.348
- Yeah.
- Now, my dad tried to stop me,

14:33.373 --> 14:35.146
but I said, "Out of my way, old man!"

14:35.171 --> 14:37.404
"I'm gonna change this world."

14:37.788 --> 14:39.663
Wow. You were really into it, huh?

14:39.688 --> 14:41.054
Yeah.

14:41.079 --> 14:43.483
I was also into this girl
that was gonna be there.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.462
They were not so big
on bras in those days.

14:47.149 --> 14:48.970
- It was the era of free love.
- Yeah.

14:48.995 --> 14:50.977
And that was right in my price range.

14:52.645 --> 14:53.900
You know, I was all excited.

14:53.925 --> 14:55.525
I was walking to find my
friends, and I passed by

14:55.550 --> 14:57.817
this electronic store
with TVs in the window.

14:57.842 --> 15:00.342
- Okay.
- And that's when I saw it.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.164
Police dogs, fire hoses,

15:03.189 --> 15:04.953
people getting tear-gassed.

15:04.978 --> 15:06.210
And I, uh...

15:06.887 --> 15:08.798
Well, I watched for
a minute, and then I...

15:09.495 --> 15:10.961
went home.

15:11.777 --> 15:14.464
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- I was embarrassed.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.187
All of my friends,

15:16.219 --> 15:17.862
they were standing up for
what they believed in, and I

15:17.886 --> 15:18.886
chicken out.

15:20.052 --> 15:24.373
Anyway, that was sort of, uh,
the end of my getting involved.

15:25.722 --> 15:28.157
But, you know, the past couple of days,

15:28.917 --> 15:30.516
you inspired me.

15:30.518 --> 15:33.152
Ah, I mean, that's great and all, but...

15:33.154 --> 15:35.645
dude, after seeing
what happened to Fawz...

15:36.925 --> 15:38.791
I'm done protesting, man.

15:38.793 --> 15:39.826
It's not worth it.

15:39.828 --> 15:41.394
No, no, no, it is, it is.

15:41.419 --> 15:44.086
Don't do what I did. Don't run away.

15:44.801 --> 15:46.535
Franco, you're a fighter.

15:47.068 --> 15:48.501
You got to fight.

15:48.503 --> 15:49.602
What's the point, Arthur?

15:49.604 --> 15:51.738
People are just gonna
twist your message around.

15:53.407 --> 15:55.241
My fighting days are over.

15:55.243 --> 15:58.111
Yeah, well, mine aren't.

16:05.056 --> 16:06.523
Where's he going with that spray paint?

16:06.955 --> 16:07.898
I don't know.

16:07.923 --> 16:09.156
Don't huff it, Arthur!

16:09.181 --> 16:10.480
It's a gateway drug!

16:16.158 --> 16:17.726
Arthur, what's all this?

16:17.728 --> 16:19.427
I just want to make
sure that people know

16:19.429 --> 16:21.196
- that the jackass who
tagged Fawz's store
 _

16:21.198 --> 16:23.364
doesn't speak for all of us.

16:23.366 --> 16:25.500
"Arabs welcome."

16:25.502 --> 16:26.801
Wow.

16:26.803 --> 16:28.365
And blacks aren't?

16:29.849 --> 16:31.037
No, I didn't mean that. I only...

16:31.062 --> 16:33.808
I'm just playing. I'm just playing, man.

16:33.810 --> 16:35.078
This is beautiful.

16:35.103 --> 16:36.945
You're pretty inspiring, yourself.

16:36.947 --> 16:38.179
But you're not worried

16:38.181 --> 16:39.881
some lunatic might see this

16:39.883 --> 16:41.177
and throw a brick through your window?

16:41.202 --> 16:43.842
Hey, listen, if I get hurt doing
the thing that I believe in,

16:43.867 --> 16:44.920
I can live with that.

16:45.350 --> 16:47.764
Oh, no, they got you, too?

16:48.692 --> 16:51.143
What kind of person hates
Arabs <i>and</i> Jews?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.277
Pick a side!

16:53.302 --> 16:54.268
Fawz.

16:54.371 --> 16:55.570
Look at the window.

16:59.869 --> 17:01.536
Arthur, you did this?

17:01.538 --> 17:03.071
Yes.

17:05.641 --> 17:07.308
Well, I'm very touched.

17:07.310 --> 17:09.277
Well...

17:09.279 --> 17:11.253
Thank you.

17:14.316 --> 17:15.784
You're welcome.

17:15.786 --> 17:18.680
Now I'm gonna get that
graffiti off your window.

17:23.826 --> 17:25.898
Fawz...

17:25.924 --> 17:27.757
I'm so sorry, man.

17:27.873 --> 17:30.318
I feel like all this was my fault.

17:33.421 --> 17:35.570
It's not your fault.

17:35.572 --> 17:37.372
There's a lot of crazies out there.

17:38.061 --> 17:39.040
- Yeah.
- I just wish

17:39.042 --> 17:41.409
they would stop hating me
for the color of my skin

17:41.411 --> 17:43.850
and instead hate me for
the content of my character.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.624
That was Dr. King's dream, right?

17:51.561 --> 17:53.031
It's close enough.

17:53.056 --> 17:54.889
But I feel you, man.

17:54.891 --> 17:56.825
Try being a black dude in Chicago

17:56.827 --> 17:59.027
and having to deal with
stop-and-frisk every ten feet.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.730
Try going through airport security

18:02.732 --> 18:05.633
as Fawz Hamadani Farooq Al-Shahrani.

18:07.937 --> 18:10.438
All four of my names
are on the watch list.

18:10.440 --> 18:11.739
Yeah.

18:11.741 --> 18:13.123
That's messed up.

18:13.148 --> 18:15.849
- Yeah, we can agree on that.
- Yeah.

18:16.446 --> 18:20.682
So, uh, I assume with
all this happening,

18:20.684 --> 18:22.951
your tenant protest is over?

18:22.953 --> 18:24.185
Depends.

18:24.187 --> 18:26.321
You gonna stop trying to force us out?

18:26.323 --> 18:29.224
Well, I'm not doing anything illegal.

18:29.226 --> 18:31.893
It's my right to do
business the way I see fit.

18:31.895 --> 18:32.861
All right, then.

18:32.863 --> 18:34.963
Good luck.

18:34.965 --> 18:36.970
You gonna need it.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.150
Not as much as you.

18:40.604 --> 18:41.769
Look at us.

18:41.771 --> 18:43.538
An Arab shaking hands with a black man

18:43.540 --> 18:45.573
while a Jew removes racist graffiti.

18:47.644 --> 18:50.311
God bless America, man!

18:50.313 --> 18:52.080
Amen.

18:54.774 --> 18:57.061
Got supplies for the
unity rally. Isn't it nice

18:57.086 --> 18:59.296
when something good
can come of a bad thing?

18:59.321 --> 19:00.988
Yeah, like my divorce.

19:00.990 --> 19:03.357
My ex went on to marry a
dentist, have three kids

19:03.359 --> 19:05.092
and a big house on the North Shore.

19:05.094 --> 19:06.627
I live in a studio apartment

19:06.629 --> 19:08.511
with a twin waterbed and a parrot.

19:09.765 --> 19:11.941
I think we know who won.

19:13.950 --> 19:16.116
Hey, look what I found!

19:16.141 --> 19:19.538
I can still use this
sign from my '64 protest.

19:19.563 --> 19:20.655
- Huh? Isn't that great?
 _

19:20.657 --> 19:24.758
Yeah. And 50 years later,
we still have racism, so...

19:25.562 --> 19:26.861
Yay!

19:28.685 --> 19:30.198
Hello, everyone.

19:30.959 --> 19:32.033
Franco,

19:32.654 --> 19:35.253
I might be feeling emotional
because of this unity rally,

19:35.255 --> 19:38.456
but I've decided to
let you and Pantsuit...

19:38.481 --> 19:39.574
It's Sweatpants.

19:40.650 --> 19:42.944
Sure, because that is less ridiculous.

19:44.557 --> 19:47.377
Anyway, I will make it so you
and all the other poor people

19:47.402 --> 19:48.917
can stay in the building.

19:50.324 --> 19:51.434
Yeah?

19:51.535 --> 19:52.921
Dude. Thanks, man.

19:52.946 --> 19:55.575
That's dope, man. I appreciate that.

19:55.841 --> 19:57.269
See that, Franco, huh?

19:57.294 --> 19:58.833
It's worth fighting for what matters.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.161
I saw the light.

20:00.655 --> 20:03.981
Well, you saw the light and
that tax loophole I showed you

20:04.006 --> 20:05.536
where keeping your low-income tenants

20:05.561 --> 20:07.926
gets you big subsidies from the city.

20:12.731 --> 20:15.957
- Really, Fawz?
- What?

20:16.313 --> 20:18.880
Everybody wins.

20:19.536 --> 20:20.715
America!

20:21.717 --> 20:23.018
Hot dogs!

20:23.513 --> 20:28.146
Apple pie!... Go Cubs?

20:29.898 --> 20:33.698
