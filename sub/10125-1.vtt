02:32.367 --> 02:34.233
I MEAN, LOOK AT TOPANGA.

02:34.233 --> 02:36.834
I THOUGHT I MISSED HER
OVER THE SUMMER,

02:36.834 --> 02:40.834
BUT I MISS HER
EVEN MORE IN PERSON.

02:40.834 --> 02:42.300

GO UP AND SAY HI.

02:44.767 --> 02:46.767
YOU'VE KNOWN HER
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

02:46.767 --> 02:49.400
THAT'S NOT
THE TOPANGA
I'VE KNOWN.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.100
IT'S LIKE SHE GOES
AWAY FOR A SUMMER,

02:52.100 --> 02:54.000
AND COMES BACK
A WOMAN.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.400

COACH FRANKLIN.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.667

02:58.667 --> 03:01.400
LOOK, WE'VE BEEN
OVER AND OVER THIS.

03:01.400 --> 03:06.400
JUST WALK UP TO HER

03:35.400 --> 03:37.667
WHY AM I
DOING THIS AGAIN?

03:37.667 --> 03:40.800

ELI! YOU GOT
SOMETHING?

11:15.934 --> 11:17.467
THE SECRETARY'S
PHONE NUMBER.

11:17.467 --> 11:19.867
I START
SATURDAY NIGHT.

11:20.934 --> 11:22.734
WHAT ABOUT
THE JOB, MAN?

11:22.734 --> 11:25.233
OVERQUALIFIED.
OVERQUALIFIED.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.400
ELI, BUDDY,
WHEN YOU'RE EVICTED,

11:28.400 --> 11:31.000
YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE
A PLACE TO STAY.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.200
HEY,
I APPRECIATE THAT.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.734
THAT PARK ACROSS
THE STREET, MAN.

11:34.734 --> 11:36.467
HEY, THEY GOT
NEW BENCHES,

11:36.467 --> 11:38.900
AND WE'D STILL
BE NEIGHBORS.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.100
ALL RIGHT,
WHERE IS HE?

11:42.100 --> 11:43.700
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN KNOCKING?

11:43.700 --> 11:45.700
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN ANYTHING ANYMORE.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.233
I DEMAND TO KNOW
WHERE SHAWN HUNTER IS.

11:47.233 --> 11:48.734
RIGHT HERE, COR.

11:48.734 --> 11:52.133
AHA! I FOUND YOU.

11:52.133 --> 11:53.700
IS THIS ABOUT
TOPANGA?

11:53.700 --> 11:55.000
WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING, SHAWN?

11:55.000 --> 11:59.400
YOU DO NOT ASK OUT
YOUR BEST FRIEND'S
GIRL. RIGHT?

11:59.400 --> 12:00.734
HOW LONG YOU
BEEN DATING?

12:00.734 --> 12:02.400
NEVER! HE DIDN'T
EVEN MAKE A MOVE.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.500
BUT I WAS
GOING TO.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.600
THIS SOUNDS LIKE
A CLEAR VIOLATION

12:05.600 --> 12:07.200
OF THE GENTLEMAN'S
CODE OF DATING.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.300
YES!

12:08.300 --> 12:10.133
A TRUE FRIEND
DOESN'T ASK OUT
A GIRL

12:10.133 --> 12:16.000
THAT HIS BUDDY LIKES
OR HAS JUST
BROKEN UP WITH.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
RIGHT, JOHN?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.734
YEAH, WELL.
YOU KNOW. WHATEVER.

12:18.734 --> 12:20.800
THERE'S ALWAYS EXCEPTIONS
TO THAT RULE.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.300
AND WOULD ONE OF
THESE EXCEPTIONS

12:23.300 --> 12:25.100
BE A CERTAIN
MISS CYNTHIA HARP?

12:25.100 --> 12:27.867
ELI, LET IT GO!
THAT WAS 10 YEARS AGO.

12:27.867 --> 12:29.800
BESIDES, YOU DUMPED HER
FOR THAT SPANISH
TRANSFER STUDENT

12:29.800 --> 12:32.033
WHOSE ONLY WORD
OF ENGLISH WAS "YES."

12:33.233 --> 12:34.600
THAT WAS MY FAVORITE
SEMESTER.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.000
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE A DIFFERENCE--

12:37.000 --> 12:38.100
EXCUSE ME.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.033
KNIFE IN THE BACK
HERE.

12:40.033 --> 12:43.300
LOOK,
ALL I DID WAS
ASK OUT A GIRL

12:43.300 --> 12:44.800
WHO DIDN'T
HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.367
WHICH REMINDS ME--
I'LL CALL HER AND
FIRM OUR PLANS.

12:48.367 --> 12:49.367
OH, GO AHEAD.

12:49.367 --> 12:50.934
FIRM YOUR LITTLE
HEART OUT.

12:50.934 --> 12:52.767
FIRM UP YOUR PLANS
FOR FRIDAY NIGHT

12:52.767 --> 12:56.000
AND EVERY NIGHT
FOR THAT MATTER,
MY FRIEND.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.867
OR SHOULD I SAY
MY EX-FRIEND?

12:58.867 --> 13:01.400
I'M OUT OF HERE.

13:04.367 --> 13:08.300
WHO'S GOING TO
TELL HIM HE'S
IN THE CLOSET?

13:11.033 --> 13:14.300
AND I'M TAKING BACK
MY SWEATER.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.000
NICE SAVE.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.367
MOM, I GOT TO
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

13:22.367 --> 13:25.500
DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT OPPOSITES
ATTRACT?

13:25.500 --> 13:26.767
WELL, YEAH.

13:26.767 --> 13:29.300
BUT IT CAN
NEVER LAST, RIGHT?

13:29.300 --> 13:30.300
WELL, ACTUALLY, CORY,

13:30.300 --> 13:33.100
YOUR DAD AND I HAD
NOTHING IN COMMON FIRST.

13:33.100 --> 13:35.934
THEN THE DIFFERENCES
MADE IT KIND OF
EXCITING.

13:35.934 --> 13:39.800
IN FACT, THE FIRST
TIME WE KISSED
WAS SO INCREDIBLY--

13:39.800 --> 13:40.800
STOP.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.734
WHY DID I EVEN
ASK A WOMAN?

13:43.734 --> 13:45.500
THEY ONLY BRING YOU
HEARTACHE.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.467
WELL,
THIS ONE BRINGS
DINNER EVERY NIGHT,

13:48.467 --> 13:49.667
A ROOF OVER
YOUR HEAD,

13:49.667 --> 13:52.200
AND THERE WAS
THAT LITTLE
GIVING BIRTH THING.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.300
MOM, THAT'S GETTING
REAL OLD.

13:54.300 --> 13:57.767
I'M SENSING ONE OF
THOSE BROTHER-TO-BROTHER
MOMENTS.

13:57.767 --> 13:59.700
I CAN TAKE IT
FROM HERE.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.834
MY PLEASURE.
HE IS ALL YOURS.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.133
YOU KNOW, COR,
A LITTLE SONG
COMES TO MIND

14:06.133 --> 14:11.200
THAT MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU THROUGH
THESE TOUGH TIMES.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.934
[SINGSONG]
TOPANGA'S GOING OUT
WITH SHAWN.

14:12.934 --> 14:15.300
TOPANGA'S GOING OUT
WITH SHAWN.

14:15.300 --> 14:16.100
HEE HEE HEE.

14:16.100 --> 14:18.200
BITE ME VERY MUCH.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.500
NOW, LISTEN.

14:19.500 --> 14:23.300
I STILL DON'T BELIEVE
TOPANGA REALLY
LIKES SHAWN.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.734
I'M GOING TO CALL HER
TO FIND OUT.

14:25.734 --> 14:28.700
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE CORDLESS TO THE ROOF

14:28.700 --> 14:32.867
SO AFTER YOU TALK TO HER,
YOU CAN JUMP!

14:34.600 --> 14:37.300
YOU'RE REALLY
HURTING, AREN'T YOU?

14:38.400 --> 14:40.600
THAT JUST TAKES
ALL THE FUN
OUT OF IT.

14:40.600 --> 14:41.600
COME HERE.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.000
I'VE NEVER FELT
SO HORRIBLE BEFORE.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.967
I MEAN, I'M SITTING
HERE LIKE THIS,

14:46.967 --> 14:50.233
AND SHE'S OUT THERE
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

14:50.233 --> 14:51.700
MAKES NO SENSE, ERIC.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.667
I GOT TO TALK
TO TOPANGA

14:53.667 --> 14:55.133
AND FIND OUT
WHERE I STAND.

14:55.133 --> 14:59.467

ABOUT 10 SECONDS

WHAT SHE'S THINKING,
SHE'LL FEEL CORNERED.

15:03.033 --> 15:07.800
ASK HER BEST FRIEND.
STRAIGHT ANSWERS.
NO PRESSURE. TIME'S UP.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.767
OH, YEAH!

15:10.767 --> 15:13.500

15:13.500 --> 15:16.200
I WAS SO TOTALLY,
TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY

15:16.200 --> 15:19.100
THAT YOU
ASKED ME HERE TODAY
AFTER SCHOOL,

15:19.100 --> 15:23.200
CONSIDERING HOW MUCH
I REALLY BUG YOU

GIVE ME THAT?

15:34.867 --> 15:38.500

15:39.867 --> 15:42.700
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

15:43.767 --> 15:46.300
WELL, I NEED TO
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.967
SAY THERE WAS
THIS GIRL

15:47.967 --> 15:51.033
WHO'S ALWAYS BEEN
DESPISED BY
A CERTAIN GUY.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.600
THEY'RE COMPLETE
OPPOSITES.
BUT ONE DAY--

15:53.600 --> 15:55.700
OH...MY GOD.

16:00.734 --> 16:04.000
BECAUSE YOU'RE
ASKING ME OUT.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
AREN'T YOU?

16:08.567 --> 16:10.200
