00:49.507 --> 00:52.844
I'll try to
convince the soldiers...

00:53.094 --> 00:54.554
not to use violence.

01:03.563 --> 01:06.858
We're guys with sticks,
are we going to kill you?

01:07.108 --> 01:08.860
The government will fall tomorrow.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.237
A government
against its people can't survive.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.657
Lay down your shields.

01:15.867 --> 01:19.871
The Soviet Union
absolutely wants revenge...

01:21.206 --> 01:23.126
and is pushing the
world toward World War III.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.126
If we don't stop it here...

01:25.585 --> 01:27.212
if we don't stop it now...

01:27.879 --> 01:29.047
it will be too late.

02:19.639 --> 02:22.058
Ukraine is full of ghosts.

02:23.476 --> 02:27.814
Ghosts of the past that
are trying to return to life.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.363
And there is a ghost at Chernobyl...

02:36.114 --> 02:38.491
whose scream was
heard around the world.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.952
I want to hunt down these ghosts...

02:41.036 --> 02:43.163
and silence them forever.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.166
Because they
want to return to life.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.752
Or drag us to their world...

02:49.169 --> 02:50.962
the world of the dead.

03:01.681 --> 03:05.769
Let's do it with a lot of texture.

03:06.227 --> 03:11.483
That will add
a sort of ancient rhythm.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.778
I don't know
what to do with this hand.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.738
Paint it the colors of Ukraine?

03:16.821 --> 03:18.323
Yes, paint it Ukrainian.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.992
It's stretching toward...

03:21.493 --> 03:24.579
upward, reaching for each other.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.790
That's it then.

03:55.777 --> 03:59.614
Let's put it further back...

04:07.956 --> 04:11.042
I read Tim Burton's memoir...

04:11.418 --> 04:14.713
he wrote, "The worst
problem on the film 'Big Fish'...

04:14.963 --> 04:18.550
was that the actor had to be naked."

04:19.884 --> 04:23.054
"And the mosquitoes bit."

04:23.763 --> 04:28.393
But we won't have any mosquitoes.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.651
And Chernobyl mosquitoes?

04:45.618 --> 04:49.289
Seeing Fedor, I realized
that he was from another world.

04:49.539 --> 04:55.211
He doesn't fit with
people of this day and age.

04:59.924 --> 05:04.637
My friends say
contradictory things about him.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.932
Some say, "He's crazy, an idiot!"

05:09.893 --> 05:11.978
"He has dirty fingernails.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.813
He doesn't brush his teeth."

05:14.731 --> 05:17.400
But the smarter ones...

05:17.859 --> 05:19.444
say that Fedor is a genius.

05:22.364 --> 05:25.075
And everything he does is theater.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.285
He thinks differently from others.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.871
A little crazy, a little strange...

05:29.954 --> 05:30.955
but always honest.

05:35.669 --> 05:39.589
During the Chernobyl
catastrophe they sent away the children...

05:39.839 --> 05:46.388
so they wouldn't
suffer from the radiation in Kiev.

05:47.305 --> 05:52.227
I remember
people were in a panic.

05:52.477 --> 05:56.022
And I was sent to an orphanage...

05:56.314 --> 05:59.818
because my
parents couldn't be with me.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.946
I was four years old.

06:03.488 --> 06:08.284
I told the children,
"I'm just here temporarily..."

06:08.535 --> 06:11.454
"My parents are
coming back for me."

06:11.705 --> 06:14.874
They said, "All parents
say that, you'll be here forever!"

06:15.542 --> 06:17.877
And I believed it.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.296
I thought I'd be there forever.

06:20.547 --> 06:23.758
It's actually quite a
serious trauma for a child.

06:24.009 --> 06:28.138
And from that time
I've felt strange... different.

06:30.849 --> 06:34.102
Fedor is so tragic.

06:35.270 --> 06:41.276
From childhood he was
a delicate, agitable, gifted boy.

06:43.486 --> 06:46.531
And he spoke like an adult.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.534
His speech was so rich and mature.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.078
Also, he was a pacifist.

06:52.162 --> 06:55.915
When he was six,
he put on a tuxedo and a bowler hat...

06:56.207 --> 07:00.003
and went to the
children with a letter...

07:00.086 --> 07:03.381
asking them not to play at war.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.509
He started collecting signatures.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.386
They beat him up.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.230
After that, he
stopped collecting signatures.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.307
When they did an analysis...

07:12.557 --> 07:15.018
they found radioactive
strontium in his bones.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.437
They wanted us to
treat him with hormones.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.607
He's suffered so
much, his health especially...

07:20.899 --> 07:22.192
all from Chernobyl.

07:23.193 --> 07:28.198
Fedor had long wanted
to make a film about Chernobyl.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.910
Because it's been more than 27 years...

07:31.993 --> 07:34.329
and the cause of the
explosion is not clear.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.291
I remembered a story from my father...

07:38.375 --> 07:40.502
who was in the Soviet Air Force.

07:40.919 --> 07:47.592
After the explosion,
he flew directly over the reactor.

07:49.594 --> 07:55.141
He said he saw
a giant luminous pyramid there.

07:55.558 --> 08:00.397
And it gleamed in the
rays of the setting sun.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.900
When Fedor heard the story...

08:04.234 --> 08:10.073
he got really excited
and wanted to go there.

08:10.156 --> 08:14.160
He found an old Soviet map...

08:14.452 --> 08:17.997
And where my father
saw the shining object...

08:18.248 --> 08:20.792
"Boy Scout Camp" was written.

08:21.209 --> 08:24.671
Many people tried to dissuade
him, because it's a radioactive zone.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.966
But Fedor ignored them.

08:28.299 --> 08:32.636
Because he felt
there was a secret here...

08:32.971 --> 08:37.808
that could shed light
on the Chernobyl explosion.

08:38.768 --> 08:42.105
Na... tio... nal Museum.

08:42.563 --> 08:43.606
And lower?

08:43.940 --> 08:45.567
Cher... no... byl.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.921
We're going to see a
terrible catastrophe...

09:07.797 --> 09:12.093
That happened when I was just your age.

09:13.303 --> 09:16.181
Nobody knows why it happened.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.392
I'm trying to find
out why it happened...

09:20.101 --> 09:21.561
and who is guilty.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.067
During the nighttime
they did an experiment.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.819
But the experiment was wrong, forbidden.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.238
They weren't supposed to do it?

09:32.489 --> 09:33.782
No, they shouldn't have.

09:40.622 --> 09:41.915
Is it poison?

09:42.332 --> 09:43.833
Yes, it's poison.

10:01.059 --> 10:06.064
When the explosion happened,
no one thought anything of it.

10:06.523 --> 10:09.526
Maybe some people
knew about the radiation.

10:10.110 --> 10:14.489
They put on masks
and we were surprised.

10:14.739 --> 10:18.159
Why wear a mask in
such good weather?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.538
Life went on as normal.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.708
Many went sunbathing at the river.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.627
Trucks came to wash the streets.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.630
We thought it was for a holiday.

10:30.922 --> 10:34.050
Our children played in that water.

10:35.093 --> 10:40.306
From the station came a
beautiful raspberry-colored steam.

10:40.807 --> 10:45.937
And to see it better,
people gathered at a bridge.

10:46.396 --> 10:51.651
But it turned out the
bridge had the most radiation.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.487
Attention! Attention!

10:55.405 --> 10:57.323
Attention! Attention!

10:58.450 --> 11:00.243
Dear Comrades:

11:00.827 --> 11:02.495
There has been an accident...

11:02.871 --> 11:07.125
at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

11:07.625 --> 11:11.963
The Communist Party
is taking all necessary measures.

11:12.714 --> 11:18.345
However, in order to fully
protect our citizens' health...

11:18.428 --> 11:21.431
children being the highest priority...

11:22.098 --> 11:25.602
It has become necessary to implement...

11:25.685 --> 11:28.438
a temporary evacuation.

11:56.883 --> 12:01.054
As you all know,
a misfortune has recently befallen us.

12:01.971 --> 12:05.934
The government did everything possible

12:06.476 --> 12:10.063
to hide the magnitude of this accident.

12:10.397 --> 12:14.609
I can say with confidence
that they didn't think about the people.

12:21.199 --> 12:23.868
If such a disaster happens...

12:24.619 --> 12:31.209
We must learn a lesson
so it doesn't happen again.

12:35.714 --> 12:40.927
But even specialists
are barred from documents...

12:41.219 --> 12:46.182
that they could be researching.

12:47.017 --> 12:50.478
When Ukraine
became independent...

12:50.729 --> 12:54.482
professional historians
had the possibility...

12:54.858 --> 13:01.072
and the need to
try to find the truth.

13:01.865 --> 13:05.035
But I went to the
archives and nothing is there.

13:05.368 --> 13:08.747
Everything was disbanded...

13:09.330 --> 13:11.833
scattered about...

13:12.959 --> 13:15.545
and in short, destroyed.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.409
We are on the edge of Kiev.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.620
Beyond the Kiev Sea
is the Chernobyl nuclear station.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.747
This sea is radioactive.

14:32.831 --> 14:37.752
This is the water of
Lethe, the water of forgetfulness.

14:38.378 --> 14:42.090
Because not much time has passed...

14:42.340 --> 14:46.678
and people have
forgotten this tragedy.

14:47.387 --> 14:52.934
I remember in my childhood,
after they sent away the children...

14:53.184 --> 14:57.897
they said red wine
protects against radiation.

15:00.025 --> 15:02.819
So let us make an offering...

15:03.570 --> 15:05.238
to the gods of the underworld...

15:06.031 --> 15:08.533
with the blood of this wine...

15:09.034 --> 15:10.744
that we may find the truth.

15:31.973 --> 15:36.144
STOP!
FORBIDDEN RADIOACTIVE ZONE

15:37.771 --> 15:41.232
but I asked, was it a crime?

15:41.649 --> 15:43.985
And I answered, there was a trial...

15:44.402 --> 15:46.821
Therefore there was a crime. Correct?

15:46.905 --> 15:49.282
We're speaking different languages...

15:49.824 --> 15:52.202
We have agreed it was a crime.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.580
I have one question:
"Are you a nuclear scientist?"

15:56.164 --> 15:57.040
I'm an artist.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.626
Аnd simply a citizen of this country.

15:59.709 --> 16:03.922
I'm a lawyer and military worker.

16:04.714 --> 16:12.180
And I think that experts should
discuss and express their opinions.

16:12.430 --> 16:17.227
No, why? Why only specialists?

16:17.310 --> 16:20.855
I'm asking experts their opinions...

16:20.939 --> 16:23.483
If your car breaks down, can you repair it?

16:23.566 --> 16:26.695
Yes, I repair my own car.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.905
It's a hobby of mine.

16:28.988 --> 16:29.823
Interesting...

16:29.906 --> 16:32.534
And nuclear energy,
do you understand it too?

16:32.867 --> 16:36.746
No. But I hope those who
are watching might understand.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.249
We're collecting different views.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.127
People should hear different opinions.

16:42.544 --> 16:45.880
I'm trying to understand
and I’m told it's a mystery...

16:46.131 --> 16:47.173
Veil of Isis, whatnot.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.217
I want to know the truth.

16:49.300 --> 16:54.097
If it was a crime and
people were condemned...

16:54.347 --> 16:58.727
But to this day, there are still
disputes about who is to blame.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.062
Maybe the perpetrators
have not yet been found.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.821
Our town was awesome.

17:10.905 --> 17:14.284
It was clean and green.

17:14.576 --> 17:17.078
We had an incredible number of roses.

17:17.912 --> 17:20.457
And there were a lot of children.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.541
And lots of joy.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.752
We had fantastic provisions.

17:25.377 --> 17:28.006
We had ketchup. Marvelous.

17:28.256 --> 17:29.424
We had chicken.

17:29.507 --> 17:31.551
It wasn't a city, it was a fairytale.

17:38.058 --> 17:41.311
We're now not too far
from the Chernobyl station.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.855
In a destroyed amusement park...

17:44.439 --> 17:47.442
in a dead city, a ghost town...

17:47.734 --> 17:51.613
where everything
is steeped in radiation...

17:51.905 --> 17:53.239
and deathly dangerous.

18:43.873 --> 18:47.961
These gas masks
were for the schoolchildren.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.922
But they don't
protect against radiation.

18:54.759 --> 19:00.140
And they're all that's left of this school.

19:21.661 --> 19:27.083
In 1976, a radio signal
terrorized the Western world.

19:28.335 --> 19:33.548
The signal was traced to
a small town in the Soviet Union...

19:33.798 --> 19:35.133
Chernobyl.

19:35.925 --> 19:40.847
Home to one of the
largest nuclear reactors in Europe.

19:41.097 --> 19:44.100
And hiding in its shadows...

19:44.434 --> 19:46.895
stands a steel monster...

19:46.978 --> 19:49.356
taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza.

19:52.567 --> 19:55.528
When driving home
from work, on the left side...

19:55.612 --> 19:57.364
a watchtower was visible.

19:57.614 --> 20:00.033
But it was a closed military town.

20:00.116 --> 20:04.037
What was there?
Some said a radio antenna.

20:04.329 --> 20:07.540
Others said
some kind of interceptor.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.627
They toyed with all kinds of ideas.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.004
But what it really was?

20:13.254 --> 20:14.506
No one knew.

20:15.006 --> 20:17.801
If they said it was
forbidden, then it was forbidden.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.387
No one was even allowed to ask.

20:20.470 --> 20:24.265
Why ask?
Just to be punished?

21:16.943 --> 21:24.284
We're at the
epicenter of the Chernobyl catastrophe.

21:26.077 --> 21:30.498
We face a mystery:
What was that sound?

21:30.749 --> 21:35.211
And why was the
Duga antenna built here?

21:35.587 --> 21:42.802
There is no connection
to the Chernobyl station's energy.

22:29.224 --> 22:33.770
The whole world knows this
sound as the "Russian Woodpecker."

22:34.270 --> 22:39.693
Most people connect this
to an over-the-horizon antenna.

22:39.776 --> 22:42.070
Namely the Duga
next to the Chernobyl station.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.613
Is that possible?

22:44.239 --> 22:50.203
No, it's not possible, for several reasons.

22:51.496 --> 22:55.792
The fact of the matter is,
the Chernobyl radar...

22:56.251 --> 23:00.964
It didn't work, so it
couldn't make any interference.

23:01.464 --> 23:08.263
Second, this antenna
was built to look in a narrow range...

23:09.556 --> 23:11.558
to the south.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.560
Not toward America or Europe.

23:13.810 --> 23:18.189
Could there be a
connection between the Duga radar...

23:18.440 --> 23:20.525
and the accident at Chernobyl?

23:21.234 --> 23:24.696
That's another question, let
me tell you about Stalin instead.

23:25.196 --> 23:29.701
First, everything
people say about his brutality...

23:30.493 --> 23:32.954
is simply impossible.

23:33.538 --> 23:37.625
Because Stalin
graduated from a seminary...

23:38.209 --> 23:41.713
and he was
meant to take Holy Orders.

23:42.839 --> 23:43.839
Holy Orders.

23:44.424 --> 23:47.427
But he was such an outstanding person...

23:47.510 --> 23:50.722
that when he saw injustice...

23:50.805 --> 23:52.640
he decided to become a revolutionary.

23:53.475 --> 23:58.313
Many people still have a Soviet mentality.

23:58.688 --> 24:02.567
They swore an oath...
they signed their names.

24:02.817 --> 24:07.280
In comes a
foreign journalist, and they clam up.

24:07.364 --> 24:12.202
They start acting
according to their former orders.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.913
What can I tell you about the antenna?

24:14.996 --> 24:15.996
Steel...

24:16.998 --> 24:17.998
Tall...

24:19.167 --> 24:21.628
It hummed in the wind.

24:22.504 --> 24:26.091
They remember the KGB...

24:26.341 --> 24:28.760
about being under constant surveillance.

24:29.010 --> 24:31.012
"God forbid I give away some secret."

24:33.515 --> 24:34.766
Military secret.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.453
Cheers.

25:10.176 --> 25:14.556
Thank you so much,
you gave us valuable information.

25:15.390 --> 25:18.977
I did my best not to give
any valuable information.

25:19.227 --> 25:20.395
Don't flatter me.

25:20.645 --> 25:25.859
I'm a military man.
The object is also military.

25:25.942 --> 25:28.236
And very classified.

25:28.778 --> 25:32.949
Remember you showed
us a list of telephone numbers...

25:33.199 --> 25:35.201
of people who served at the Duga?

25:35.452 --> 25:38.538
But then you didn't
want to give it to us...

25:38.788 --> 25:41.124
when you saw
an American with us.

25:41.374 --> 25:42.834
That's right.

25:42.917 --> 25:45.837
I won’t give it.

25:46.129 --> 25:50.300
Understand, there are things that…

25:51.009 --> 25:53.261
Are you a Ukrainian citizen?

25:53.511 --> 25:54.721
I am a Ukrainian citizen.

25:54.804 --> 25:59.142
And I am a Ukrainian citizen.

25:59.476 --> 26:01.311
And I will remain so.

26:01.686 --> 26:05.607
There are things you
shouldn’t blabber about.

26:06.191 --> 26:11.571
So you don't want
anything to do with Americans?

26:12.655 --> 26:14.366
In this matter, yes.

26:14.824 --> 26:16.910
May I use the bathroom?

26:49.734 --> 26:54.030
Our object was a system
for missile warning.

26:54.531 --> 27:00.161
In 10 years we
detected every Shuttle launch.

27:01.329 --> 27:02.372
All.

27:02.706 --> 27:08.044
And during that time,
every country in the world...

27:08.586 --> 27:11.089
heard the Woodpecker.

27:21.057 --> 27:28.398
This tap-tap-tap-tap,
this 10 hertz signal...

27:28.857 --> 27:36.573
Yes, it resembles a
woodpecker knocking on a tree.

27:38.033 --> 27:42.203
So the Woodpecker
signal came from the Duga?

27:43.079 --> 27:44.330
Well, yes.

27:48.001 --> 27:50.378
I will answer
as a radar specialist.

27:50.670 --> 27:53.965
In fact, I'm
nicknamed "Antenna Man."

27:55.675 --> 27:56.755
Since the Earth is round...

27:56.885 --> 27:58.386
you will never see all of it.

27:58.803 --> 28:00.680
Because there is
a zone of invisibility.

28:01.056 --> 28:03.266
Here you can see,
and here you can see.

28:03.641 --> 28:05.226
But here you can't see.

28:05.518 --> 28:09.064
Now, to speak specifically
about the Chernobyl antenna...

28:10.023 --> 28:13.860
this is one of three super-powerful...

28:14.110 --> 28:16.529
over-the-horizon radars.

28:16.905 --> 28:23.870
The antenna cost twice as much
as the Chernobyl nuclear plant.

28:24.913 --> 28:28.708
Around seven billion Russian rubles.

28:28.958 --> 28:33.171
It works because
of the ionosphere...

28:33.588 --> 28:36.216
The ray bounces off the ionosphere...

28:36.466 --> 28:39.386
bounces off the
Earth and grabs information.

28:39.636 --> 28:41.721
And then comes back.

28:41.805 --> 28:44.057
It's a curved gun.

28:53.608 --> 28:59.948
The Duga caused a lot of problems.
Not only in Europe, but in the USSR.

29:00.907 --> 29:04.661
Our radar interfered with SOS signals.

29:05.495 --> 29:08.665
So the head technician came...

29:08.957 --> 29:12.293
and changed the frequency.

29:12.377 --> 29:18.633
But at this new frequency...

29:21.469 --> 29:27.600
our signal was unable
to overcome the Northern Lights.

30:45.261 --> 30:47.722
It's difficult for me to speak...

30:47.806 --> 30:52.852
Because what I see
is not a human creation.

30:53.144 --> 30:55.605
It's the creation of Empire.

31:01.736 --> 31:05.448
And this pile of metal was
useless from the very beginning.

31:05.949 --> 31:10.412
It was useless
before it was even built.

31:11.788 --> 31:16.126
It had no theoretical basis to function...

31:16.376 --> 31:18.670
and so it was doomed from the start.

31:43.695 --> 31:50.702
This iron curtain was the
source of the Russian Woodpecker sound.

31:51.119 --> 31:53.371
And this Iron Curtain...

31:53.830 --> 31:56.791
was known as "The Eye of Moscow."

31:58.043 --> 32:03.631
The "Moscow Eye" next
to an atomic heart, Chernobyl station...

32:04.090 --> 32:06.217
the heart of the Soviet Union.

32:07.302 --> 32:09.471
But this eye was blind.

32:09.846 --> 32:12.182
This antenna didn't work.

32:13.391 --> 32:17.771
Could there be a
connection between this blind eye...

32:18.021 --> 32:21.149
And the bursting
of the atomic heart?

32:26.154 --> 32:28.698
Somehow they're connected...

32:28.948 --> 32:29.948
but it's a mystery.

32:29.991 --> 32:33.119
Because for me it was a huge tragedy.

32:33.411 --> 32:36.581
And every tragedy must have a reason.

32:36.664 --> 32:39.459
There are no coincidences.

32:43.755 --> 32:45.674
The collapse of the Soviet Union...

32:45.924 --> 32:48.968
was the greatest
geopolitical catastrophe of the century.

33:21.793 --> 33:25.547
We know that the Soviet system is evil.

33:26.047 --> 33:27.966
It started with evil...

33:28.341 --> 33:32.262
And ended with the greatest
evil, the Chernobyl disaster.

33:33.972 --> 33:38.351
And again there are
victims and will be victims.

33:38.893 --> 33:40.854
And again there will be war.

34:38.620 --> 34:42.498
When Fedor started
researching the Duga antenna...

34:42.581 --> 34:44.417
he really scared me.

34:45.502 --> 34:50.340
I'm afraid because he's
exploring a topic no one has raised.

34:50.632 --> 34:52.717
Because we live in a criminal country.

34:54.344 --> 34:56.929
We are far from a democracy.

34:57.764 --> 35:01.810
We don't have freedom of press.

35:02.143 --> 35:06.940
Of course I'm afraid for my only son.

35:07.565 --> 35:12.779
And don't forget Stalin
physically destroyed our family.

35:12.862 --> 35:16.950
Both of my grandmothers
were sent to the gulag.

35:17.283 --> 35:21.204
The reflections of
the Soviet Union remain...

35:21.287 --> 35:23.206
and these people are still here.

35:23.289 --> 35:26.126
They are among us.

35:26.376 --> 35:28.128
He was my older brother.

35:28.670 --> 35:29.754
Petro.

35:34.968 --> 35:37.679
They came for
him during his lessons.

35:37.762 --> 35:40.015
Soviet partisans.

35:41.766 --> 35:43.184
They shot him.

35:46.771 --> 35:48.106
I can't...

35:55.697 --> 35:58.116
It's hard for
me to tell this story.

35:58.366 --> 35:59.701
I was a child...

35:59.951 --> 36:02.704
but I loved him more
than anything in the world.

36:04.789 --> 36:07.625
My father had it worst of all.

36:08.293 --> 36:11.463
Someone from the KGB arrived...

36:11.963 --> 36:15.759
"You have to write that your
parents are enemies of the state."

36:16.926 --> 36:20.889
Papa said, "Give me a minute to think."

36:20.972 --> 36:24.976
Then he threw
an inkstand at him.

36:25.393 --> 36:29.022
He hid behind the table
and the inkstand crashed into a wall.

36:29.397 --> 36:33.026
Of course, he also
went to the gulag for that.

36:33.568 --> 36:35.403
That was my father.

36:35.487 --> 36:37.781
Fedor's behavior is similar.

36:47.999 --> 36:50.919
This was the Chief Designer.

36:52.295 --> 36:55.799
Video recording, no...

36:56.925 --> 37:01.429
Could you show us
a model and answer a few questions?

37:03.181 --> 37:05.642
Hold on, what kind of questions?

37:07.227 --> 37:10.063
Why are you suddenly interested in this?

37:11.731 --> 37:15.193
Yes! That's it. That's it.

37:15.610 --> 37:17.696
Oh my god, so beautiful.

37:19.280 --> 37:22.367
The Americans always
put us in an interesting situation.

37:22.450 --> 37:27.872
They pulled their
equipment close to our borders...

37:28.164 --> 37:34.671
making it easier
to monitor our territory.

37:35.005 --> 37:40.677
And to compensate for
our lack of information...

37:40.969 --> 37:43.805
this system was created...

37:44.055 --> 37:46.808
which was called the Duga.

37:47.267 --> 37:54.149
We were provoked,
so we had to respond.

37:54.399 --> 37:57.610
Therefore we created
tools like the Duga...

37:57.986 --> 37:59.654
so there wouldn't be a war.

38:00.238 --> 38:06.661
Why were all these documents,
materials, archives destroyed?

38:07.537 --> 38:11.833
You are asking a very delicate question.

38:12.667 --> 38:14.878
Some things I don't understand
and don't want to understand.

38:14.961 --> 38:18.089
And I don't want
to talk about this topic.

38:20.008 --> 38:22.844
Why were the Americans
afraid of the Chernobyl radar?

38:23.428 --> 38:26.222
Because our signal could have covered...

38:26.306 --> 38:28.641
all nine US missile bases.

38:29.142 --> 38:31.394
And this was a deterrent.

38:32.520 --> 38:38.360
Our antenna gave the
government 25 minutes...

38:38.443 --> 38:39.694
To make a decision.

38:39.944 --> 38:42.197
What could we have
done in only 10 minutes?

38:42.530 --> 38:44.074
Well, they could have said...

38:44.157 --> 38:46.576
"Go hide under a table."

38:47.702 --> 38:50.622
But with 25 minutes,
we can give the command...

38:50.705 --> 38:51.905
to launch our own missiles.

39:53.309 --> 39:56.813
So the antenna was on combat duty...

39:57.355 --> 40:02.360
The Duga never entered combat mode.

40:02.736 --> 40:05.363
Before the accident of April 1986...

40:05.947 --> 40:10.201
we were making our final revisions...

40:10.618 --> 40:14.039
after which we would
go to combat mode...

40:14.289 --> 40:16.583
in September, 1986.

40:16.875 --> 40:21.338
Instead, we got an
Order of Closure and Liquidation.

40:22.464 --> 40:30.464
There were only three
or four months until September.

40:31.056 --> 40:37.520
You know that the Duga
didn't work very well, right?

40:37.604 --> 40:39.272
Of course.

40:39.356 --> 40:44.486
And on September 1st, 1986
a commission was to inspect the Duga?

40:45.403 --> 40:53.403
Therefore, the Chernobyl catastrophe
benefited the builders of the Duga?

40:56.915 --> 40:59.668
Of course.
Without a doubt.

40:59.751 --> 41:03.213
It could be at the
very least a motivation...

41:03.505 --> 41:09.552
for those responsible for the Duga...

41:10.387 --> 41:13.515
which cost a lot of money...

41:13.765 --> 41:16.518
and in the end didn't work.

41:16.768 --> 41:21.815
It didn’t work because it was
to someone’s advantage to close it.

41:21.898 --> 41:26.027
In general, there
were so many irregularities.

41:26.361 --> 41:30.699
If you read the official version quickly...

41:30.782 --> 41:34.661
everything looks normal, logical.

41:34.994 --> 41:39.332
But when you start to look deeper,
and ask why this… and why that…

41:39.708 --> 41:42.836
There are a lot
of questions, and no answers.

41:43.128 --> 41:47.298
Maybe if something
so important didn't work...

41:47.716 --> 41:51.261
The best way to hide the failure...

41:51.553 --> 41:54.681
is to blame it on the accident.

41:54.764 --> 41:58.977
If we're searching for who benefited...

41:59.644 --> 42:03.356
we can say that
the builder of the Duga did.

42:04.441 --> 42:06.985
Maybe, yes.

42:07.068 --> 42:10.739
They pushed the
personnel to take a big risk.

42:11.281 --> 42:14.451
In the end, they drove the
reactor into a dangerous state...

42:14.909 --> 42:18.329
And then an
uncontrolled chain reaction began.

42:18.747 --> 42:22.500
Do you know the Soviet punishment...

42:22.751 --> 42:26.046
For misappropriating government funds?

42:26.546 --> 42:27.714
The death sentence.

42:28.340 --> 42:32.844
This statute applied to
whoever wasted those 7 billion.

42:32.927 --> 42:38.516
And to save his life, maybe he
caused the Chernobyl catastrophe.

42:38.600 --> 42:44.189
I'll answer as someone who
has worked 26 years at this station.

42:44.606 --> 42:47.400
I ran the reactor
with my own hands.

42:47.484 --> 42:49.694
So I know what I’m talking about.

42:50.403 --> 42:52.822
Your version is extremely fantastical.

42:53.615 --> 42:54.741
Very.

42:55.116 --> 42:57.243
It's clearly fantastical, but...

42:57.327 --> 42:58.620
I think not.

42:59.579 --> 43:02.082
"No because..."?

43:02.499 --> 43:07.045
I would never have
allowed such a thing to happen.

43:07.587 --> 43:09.172
So we can say...

43:09.589 --> 43:11.716
Artem, is the camera running?

43:12.634 --> 43:16.179
So no one
claims we edited this...

43:16.429 --> 43:18.890
I'll repeat it in a full sentence.

43:19.391 --> 43:24.187
The theory that Chernobyl
was exploded on purpose...

43:24.437 --> 43:27.899
to hide the non-functioning Duga...

43:28.358 --> 43:29.358
Bullshit.

43:29.401 --> 43:36.032
So much malarkey and fantasies.

43:36.533 --> 43:38.827
First, zombies...

43:39.285 --> 43:40.870
That we blew up Chernobyl station.

43:41.162 --> 43:42.162
Stupidity.

43:45.125 --> 43:47.335
It's a theory.

43:47.585 --> 43:50.213
I'm not a prosecutor,
I'm not a journalist.

43:50.463 --> 43:51.881
I'm just a person.

44:22.120 --> 44:26.207
Behind this there must be one person.

44:26.708 --> 44:32.797
And all roads lead to Moscow.

44:33.256 --> 44:37.677
Because the Duga
reported to Moscow...

44:37.927 --> 44:41.514
And the Chernobyl
station reported to Moscow.

44:42.015 --> 44:45.226
So, the Woodpecker truly is Russian...

44:45.477 --> 44:49.314
Even though he resides in Ukraine.

44:51.733 --> 44:58.156
And if we connect
this person to the Woodpecker...

44:58.448 --> 45:00.700
we will understand everything.

45:12.754 --> 45:19.511
One day he was
reading and I was watching...

45:37.320 --> 45:44.661
Then it was as if something had stung him.

45:50.333 --> 45:53.753
"I discovered who did it!"

45:54.462 --> 45:57.757
"Look, Artem, look! I found it!"

45:57.841 --> 45:59.592
And then he showed me.

46:00.885 --> 46:04.222
It was the first time I heard his theory.

46:04.681 --> 46:06.891
And I was convinced.

46:08.393 --> 46:10.520
Fedor investigated
all the builders of the Duga...

46:10.937 --> 46:14.983
and found one person who
had the motive and the power...

46:15.233 --> 46:17.527
to cause the catastrophe.

46:17.610 --> 46:21.031
Well, this is in the
realm of conspiracy theories...

46:21.781 --> 46:25.160
Such a person exists.
I'll tell you who he is.

46:25.410 --> 46:27.412
It was one Shamshin.

46:27.495 --> 46:31.583
I ask that we not
mention his name on air…

46:32.125 --> 46:33.626
And is he still alive?

46:33.918 --> 46:35.211
No, he died in 2009.

46:35.795 --> 46:39.215
He started work on
over-the-horizon radar in 1948.

46:39.466 --> 46:42.260
And he was
responsible for the Duga's construction.

46:42.552 --> 46:45.513
And this man...

46:45.930 --> 46:52.354
became Minister of Communications
when the Duga was launched.

46:53.355 --> 46:56.733
The Vice-President of the
Soviet-Cuban Friendship Society...

46:56.816 --> 46:59.361
Soviet Minister Shamshin...

46:59.652 --> 47:03.823
noted that heroic Soviet
support led to the Cuban revolution...

47:03.907 --> 47:07.994
which gave a strong impulse
to the liberation of Latin America.

47:08.244 --> 47:13.333
This shows his significance.

47:14.376 --> 47:21.091
He's Minister and Vice President
of the Soviet-Cuban Friendship Society.

47:21.841 --> 47:27.597
It's important because "Soviet-Cuban
friendship" means "war against the US."

47:28.264 --> 47:32.852
Only America and the
Soviet Union could pull off...

47:33.103 --> 47:37.399
a system as powerful as
the over-the-horizon radar.

47:37.941 --> 47:41.277
And Shamshin insisted on building it.

47:42.320 --> 47:46.449
Shamshin was not alone
in supporting the creation of the Duga.

47:47.075 --> 47:49.077
At the very top, he was alone.

47:49.327 --> 47:51.579
But the physicist Kabanov said...

47:52.455 --> 47:55.208
that it's impossible
to build such an antenna.

47:56.084 --> 48:00.547
So if it came out that it didn’t work...

48:00.839 --> 48:03.925
Shamshin would
have had big problems?

48:04.259 --> 48:05.468
Of course, big problems.

48:06.428 --> 48:08.680
Is it even technically possible...

48:08.930 --> 48:11.224
if you had the power...

48:11.683 --> 48:14.936
to create such a grand catastrophe?

48:15.562 --> 48:22.694
Well, there are dozens
of ways to blow up the reactor.

48:22.986 --> 48:24.446
It's not difficult.

48:25.071 --> 48:29.743
There is testimony from
a quite respectable person.

48:30.201 --> 48:31.286
Komarov.

48:31.369 --> 48:34.664
I advise you to meet with
him to discuss the matter.

48:34.914 --> 48:36.124
While he is still alive...

48:36.499 --> 48:40.670
I served on the Expert Commission...

48:41.546 --> 48:43.757
of the General
Prosecutor's office of the USSR.

48:44.257 --> 48:49.346
I was head of the commission
for the investigation of the accident.

48:50.722 --> 48:58.722
I had access to all documents
provided to the Prosecutor's office.

49:02.650 --> 49:07.489
I was at the Chernobyl
station during its construction.

49:08.239 --> 49:13.620
I was Deputy Chief
Engineer of Science and Safety.

49:14.204 --> 49:17.457
After this I was sent to Moscow.

49:17.707 --> 49:23.963
And joined the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

49:24.422 --> 49:30.970
Kopchinski, the Head of Atomic Energy,
insisted they proceed with the experiment.

49:31.471 --> 49:37.602
But the reactor was unstable,
working under capacity for a day.

49:37.852 --> 49:42.607
Proceeding with that
experiment was suicide.

49:43.608 --> 49:47.612
There was constant communication between
Kopchinski and the Shift Supervisor.

49:48.154 --> 49:52.742
I talked to a lot of personnel
and they agreed it all hangs on this call.

49:53.034 --> 49:55.412
And it was the cause of the catastrophe.

49:55.954 --> 49:58.456
First of all, I was home, naturally.

49:58.540 --> 50:00.625
Naturally, I was in bed.

50:01.126 --> 50:04.879
My son and daughter are
witnesses that I was at home.

50:05.922 --> 50:09.509
When Kopchinski says
there was no telephone connection...

50:09.759 --> 50:12.929
between his
apartment and the station...

50:13.221 --> 50:14.556
it's nonsense.

50:14.973 --> 50:17.475
You can call the station
from any apartment.

50:18.226 --> 50:24.190
Mr. Komarov should
know, if he's such an expert...

50:25.692 --> 50:30.572
That no one can give a command,
not even the General Secretary...

50:30.822 --> 50:34.034
to the personnel
of a nuclear power plant.

50:34.325 --> 50:39.831
A Chernobyl engineer can't argue with a
senior official of the Communist Party.

50:40.415 --> 50:45.295
Why on Earth would a senior engineer...

50:45.545 --> 50:50.675
take a risk when it's clear
you can't start up the block?

50:51.176 --> 50:52.927
I ask you the question.

50:53.595 --> 50:56.931
Destroy everything? They lost their minds?

50:57.599 --> 50:59.017
You can't turn on the block!

50:59.768 --> 51:01.519
It's a crime.

51:02.270 --> 51:07.484
The day shift refused
to do it, but the late shift agreed.

51:07.817 --> 51:09.944
And they blew up the reactor.

51:10.820 --> 51:13.073
There can be only one reason...

51:13.156 --> 51:14.616
Someone pushed them.

51:15.533 --> 51:23.533
The transcripts of all
intercity calls are in two publications.

51:30.006 --> 51:33.843
My voice appears only after the accident.

51:34.803 --> 51:38.640
In principle he could have destroyed them.

51:39.641 --> 51:43.478
Because the KGB took orders from the Party.

51:45.063 --> 51:49.484
All these fairytales about
a command from Moscow...

51:50.068 --> 51:52.862
that it was planned...

51:53.321 --> 51:57.200
These tales are crafted
by odious and dirty people.

51:57.450 --> 52:00.453
Just such a person is Komarov.

52:01.037 --> 52:07.544
If that call took place,
it ought to be in the archives.

52:07.877 --> 52:13.800
But the calls and times
in the record don't match.

52:14.467 --> 52:20.432
In fact, the tape they
provided us was falsified.

52:21.433 --> 52:26.438
To prove this,
you need all the documents.

52:27.272 --> 52:30.442
But till this time the
documents are classified.

52:31.067 --> 52:33.778
About Kopchinski...

52:34.029 --> 52:35.989
We have a saying:

52:36.239 --> 52:39.075
"Feathers are sticking to his muzzle."

52:39.159 --> 52:40.452
He...

52:41.036 --> 52:44.289
He has a record of bad deeds...

52:44.539 --> 52:47.375
significant ones.

52:48.126 --> 52:51.546
If you suspect
he's lying, he's capable.

52:52.464 --> 52:54.341
He's capable of lying.

52:56.593 --> 53:01.056
Komarov says there
was a call from Kopchinski.

53:01.473 --> 53:05.602
He and his colleagues
heard recordings of the call.

53:05.852 --> 53:09.522
It wasn't just one call,
it was a continuous conversation...

53:10.482 --> 53:13.068
Kopchinski denies it.

53:13.485 --> 53:16.071
He says he was home asleep.

53:18.406 --> 53:21.368
But there was one man...

53:21.868 --> 53:25.622
for whom this call was necessary.

53:26.331 --> 53:28.667
An all-powerful man.

53:30.877 --> 53:34.130
Were you acquainted
with Vasily Shamshin?

53:34.839 --> 53:36.049
Shamshin?

53:36.966 --> 53:38.927
There was no such man.

53:39.177 --> 53:41.096
He's uncomfortable...

53:42.472 --> 53:44.099
Minister of Communications?

53:44.849 --> 53:47.811
He made that call on
orders from Shamshin.

53:47.894 --> 53:53.983
But he never expected
that this truth would come out.

53:55.235 --> 54:00.198
We've followed leads
and arranged various threads.

54:00.573 --> 54:04.369
And not once has
a thread snapped.

54:04.703 --> 54:10.500
Every time we make an
assumption, it turns out true.

54:10.750 --> 54:14.087
To me it's obvious.

54:14.379 --> 54:18.883
But we'll never find
evidence to convince the doubters.

54:19.175 --> 54:22.470
The kind of evidence that
could stand in a Nuremberg trial.

54:22.971 --> 54:25.765
Because after the Nuremberg trials...

54:26.141 --> 54:30.979
intelligent politicians stopped
leaving that sort of evidence behind.

54:33.273 --> 54:36.109
This is the year our story begins.

54:36.359 --> 54:40.530
This is the year Shamshin's Duga was born.

54:41.489 --> 54:45.452
Shamshin rose through the ranks
thanks to the over-the-horizon radar.

54:45.535 --> 54:48.329
The year they turned on the Duga.

54:48.747 --> 54:51.624
He becomes Minister
of Communications of the USSR.

54:52.208 --> 54:57.964
1984: A new wave of repression.

54:58.923 --> 55:01.926
How did Shamshin feel during this time...

55:02.344 --> 55:05.680
realizing that the Duga didn't work?

55:06.014 --> 55:09.267
Some sort of plan
arose within Shamshin.

55:12.062 --> 55:15.482
The most important year for Shamshin.

55:16.024 --> 55:20.612
In March, Shamshin became a member
of the Communist Party Central Committee.

55:21.821 --> 55:25.241
The highest leadership of the country.

55:26.534 --> 55:31.414
And we know that in September
the Committee will give its verdict...

55:32.457 --> 55:38.880
on the most important
act in the life of Shamshin:

55:39.172 --> 55:41.132
The Duga.

55:44.844 --> 55:51.685
We know the
story of a call from Moscow.

55:52.227 --> 55:54.396
On the night of the tragedy.

55:54.688 --> 55:57.399
The call that instigated the tragedy.

55:57.649 --> 56:04.280
This was the final experiment
in a series that took place all spring...

56:04.781 --> 56:08.785
up to April 26th.

56:09.327 --> 56:13.331
A day that is located
between March and September.

56:15.291 --> 56:17.585
A day...

56:18.086 --> 56:20.380
that destroyed three countries.

56:20.630 --> 56:22.924
And which saved Shamshin.

56:23.758 --> 56:26.845
Because after the Chernobyl catastrophe...

56:27.637 --> 56:31.474
no commission
came to inspect the Duga.

56:32.851 --> 56:36.688
"April 26th"

56:37.939 --> 56:41.776
A tragedy which left
behind deserted and dead lands.

56:42.402 --> 56:46.573
A tragedy which took place
because of a call from Moscow...

56:47.615 --> 56:52.078
to save the career
of a Moscow bureaucrat.

57:03.798 --> 57:08.553
Film is not literal,
it speaks of emotions through image.

57:09.304 --> 57:11.181
We have an anti-hero.

57:11.264 --> 57:12.724
I'm the hero...

57:12.807 --> 57:14.476
Shamshin is the anti-hero.

57:14.976 --> 57:17.187
And we have a conflict. But he's dead.

57:17.479 --> 57:19.773
So now I'm going to smash his face.

57:19.856 --> 57:21.566
And then I'm going to his grave in Moscow.

57:22.150 --> 57:24.736
Should I piss on the grave?

57:24.819 --> 57:26.154
No, I shouldn't do that.

57:26.237 --> 57:29.449
On the contrary,
at his grave I should say...

57:29.532 --> 57:33.411
that I am the
only person who wants him alive.

57:33.495 --> 57:35.455
Because I want
to look him in the eye.

57:35.705 --> 57:38.458
But if I go to the grave and say that...

57:38.541 --> 57:40.543
without smashing him...

57:40.960 --> 57:43.171
then it seems like I forgive...

57:43.421 --> 57:46.549
the mastermind of
the Chernobyl catastrophe.

57:46.633 --> 57:48.635
But I don't forgive.

58:40.979 --> 58:47.068
When Fedor told me
his theory, my stomach tightened.

58:47.318 --> 58:49.779
I thought about the KGB.

58:49.863 --> 58:53.700
I thought, "There will be a summons..."

58:55.535 --> 58:58.538
Actually, these days
they don't bother with a summons...

58:59.039 --> 59:00.665
They simply kill you.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.752
I'm nervous.

59:04.294 --> 59:06.338
I'm nervous about your film.

59:13.720 --> 59:15.638
Fedor, listen to me.

59:16.222 --> 59:20.101
Don’t be a provocateur. That’s it.

59:20.810 --> 59:24.981
I think for a filmmaker to
go to Moscow, it’s more…more…

59:25.065 --> 59:30.653
Why? A filmmaker can
very easily fit into a KGB prison.

59:36.785 --> 59:39.788
If you accuse anyone who has influence...

59:40.038 --> 59:41.915
then, yes, it's dangerous.

59:42.207 --> 59:46.961
Two years ago my
Chernobyl book came out in Moscow.

59:47.504 --> 59:52.300
I went there to pick up a few copies.

59:53.593 --> 59:58.640
Soon after, it turns out I was poisoned.

59:59.641 --> 01:00:01.518
I wouldn't risk it.

01:00:07.232 --> 01:00:10.568
Mother: I'm constantly worried about Fedor.

01:00:10.902 --> 01:00:13.988
I'm afraid for him.

01:00:14.531 --> 01:00:18.827
Because they're taking hostages.

01:00:19.911 --> 01:00:23.206
His wife is worried,
she doesn't want him to go.

01:00:25.125 --> 01:00:27.961
Father: I think it's
better if he doesn't go.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:29.754
It's dangerous.

01:00:29.838 --> 01:00:31.756
He has a Ukrainian passport.

01:00:32.215 --> 01:00:35.051
It's a criminal situation.

01:00:35.635 --> 01:00:37.387
You never know who
you'll meet on the road.

01:00:38.513 --> 01:00:42.308
Papa, don't go to Moscow.

01:00:42.851 --> 01:00:45.270
There's a war there.

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:47.147
I'm worried.

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:52.610
I think there's a real danger.

01:00:52.861 --> 01:00:54.654
Especially in this situation.

01:00:55.113 --> 01:00:59.576
The police will come,
find heroin in our suitcases.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.786
"Witnesses!"

01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:04.831
"It's heroin, that's 14 years!"

01:01:05.081 --> 01:01:08.752
We'll sit in prison
and they'll torture us.

01:01:09.002 --> 01:01:12.672
Then they'll say,
"He died of a heart attack."

01:01:13.923 --> 01:01:16.926
It's not the Russia we used to know.

01:01:17.177 --> 01:01:19.262
It's the Soviet Union again.

01:01:19.512 --> 01:01:20.972
It's back.

01:01:21.431 --> 01:01:27.729
Fedor just called.
He wants me to come over.

01:01:28.229 --> 01:01:31.191
He's afraid to speak by telephone.

01:01:31.441 --> 01:01:35.403
He doesn't want
any of the crew to come.

01:01:37.697 --> 01:01:39.824
Hi Fedor, I'm getting in a taxi.

01:01:40.075 --> 01:01:41.534
I'll be there soon.

01:02:00.136 --> 01:02:03.848
I will put away the KGB colonel’s cup.

01:02:05.725 --> 01:02:09.437
I have a disclaimer that
must be inserted before the film.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:15.860
“The authors of this film in no
way intend to injure relations...

01:02:16.111 --> 01:02:19.155
between Ukraine,
Belarus, and Russia."

01:02:19.406 --> 01:02:21.199
Why are you saying this?

01:02:21.449 --> 01:02:23.618
Because I was advised to.

01:02:23.868 --> 01:02:25.620
Who told you this?

01:02:25.704 --> 01:02:28.164
A colonel from the secret police.

01:02:28.415 --> 01:02:33.378
He said, "You have
a big problem now."

01:02:33.712 --> 01:02:34.796
What kind of problem?

01:02:34.879 --> 01:02:37.716
The kind of
problem that can get you killed.

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:41.177
He came here. He knew I was here.

01:02:41.469 --> 01:02:43.555
He said it didn’t happen.

01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:45.724
What didn’t happen?

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:47.642
The call.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.440
Artem: From Kopchinski?
Fedor: It didn’t happen.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.731
He told us to say
the call never happened?

01:02:52.814 --> 01:02:53.732
Yes.

01:02:53.815 --> 01:02:55.525
What are you afraid of?

01:02:56.192 --> 01:02:59.779
I'm afraid they will kill my son.

01:03:00.196 --> 01:03:04.993
I want to soften all the
sharp moments in the film.

01:03:05.076 --> 01:03:10.081
When I shout that Moscow and
the Kremlin and Russia are guilty...

01:03:10.331 --> 01:03:13.793
I want that cut entirely from the film.

01:03:15.086 --> 01:03:18.715
It seems to me you're selling out.
Fedor: I am not selling out.

01:03:18.798 --> 01:03:19.841
Artem: You're selling out.

01:03:20.133 --> 01:03:23.595
You complained that
your father sold out in his day.

01:03:24.095 --> 01:03:27.932
The film should be
truthful and not censored.

01:03:28.933 --> 01:03:31.895
Must you investigate this further?

01:03:32.228 --> 01:03:34.356
I want to finish the film.

01:03:34.439 --> 01:03:37.984
I understand,
but you won’t be able to.

01:03:38.276 --> 01:03:40.362
The secret police are on to us.

01:03:41.279 --> 01:03:44.032
We have to finish shooting.

01:03:44.532 --> 01:03:47.702
Do you understand
what you are risking?

01:03:47.786 --> 01:03:50.747
The life of my son.

01:03:51.206 --> 01:03:53.875
There wasn’t any call.
There was nothing.

01:03:53.958 --> 01:03:56.836
Artem: How can that be? It did happen.

01:03:57.087 --> 01:03:59.047
Fedor: Yes, it did.

01:03:59.339 --> 01:04:02.133
Fedor: Now it is possible
to say with 100% certainty...

01:04:02.592 --> 01:04:05.470
"Yes, we are right."

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:09.432
Because they
said it didn’t happen.

01:04:09.683 --> 01:04:10.683
Understand?

01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:20.610
My father...

01:04:21.861 --> 01:04:23.697
could have lost his job.

01:04:25.573 --> 01:04:28.326
And that's why he didn't stand up.

01:04:31.579 --> 01:04:32.872
Are you going to Moscow?

01:04:34.332 --> 01:04:35.792
No, you didn't listen to me.

01:04:36.042 --> 01:04:40.338
I'm stopping all
research into this call.

01:04:40.672 --> 01:04:41.672
It's finished.

01:04:44.676 --> 01:04:47.053
When we started this film...

01:04:47.387 --> 01:04:51.766
Fedor was the first to
speak out against the Soviet Union...

01:04:54.019 --> 01:04:57.063
against corrupt authorities...

01:04:57.355 --> 01:04:59.983
and a system based on the...

01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:04.654
use of guilt, threats,
violence and intimidation.

01:05:05.196 --> 01:05:10.243
And now I see him
playing by the rules of the Soviet system.

01:05:10.785 --> 01:05:12.203
Because this belief...

01:05:12.787 --> 01:05:16.249
that we could uncover something...

01:05:17.042 --> 01:05:20.420
Fedor instilled this in me..

01:05:20.712 --> 01:05:22.130
in all of us.

01:05:22.922 --> 01:05:28.303
None of us believed
the Soviet system could return.

01:05:28.678 --> 01:05:29.971
He predicted this.

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:36.019
And now he's backtracking,
making concessions and compromises.

01:05:36.102 --> 01:05:38.897
And he's become a
traitor to his own ideals.

01:05:39.314 --> 01:05:40.940
He'll try to justify himself.

01:05:41.024 --> 01:05:42.942
But I think he is a coward.

01:05:53.536 --> 01:05:56.623
I don't want to speak on camera...

01:05:58.083 --> 01:05:59.501
I'm afraid.

01:05:59.751 --> 01:06:01.378
I won't speak out.

01:06:01.461 --> 01:06:04.464
Unfortunately, the Soviet
Union is still very much alive.

01:06:04.714 --> 01:06:06.466
It's a ghoul...

01:06:06.716 --> 01:06:08.927
a creature we didn't beat to death.

01:06:25.819 --> 01:06:33.159
<i>♪ Ukraine's freedom has
not yet perished... ♪</i>

01:06:33.493 --> 01:06:37.664
<i>♪ ...nor has her glory. ♪</i>

01:06:38.331 --> 01:06:46.331
<i>♪ Upon us, fellow Ukrainians,
fate shall smile once more. ♪</i>

01:06:50.176 --> 01:06:58.176
<i>♪ Our enemies will vanish
like dew in the sun... ♪</i>

01:07:02.355 --> 01:07:07.318
<i>♪ And we too shall rule, brothers... ♪</i>

01:07:08.028 --> 01:07:14.075
<i>♪ ...in a free land of our own. ♪</i>

01:07:14.659 --> 01:07:22.659
<i>♪ We'll lay down our souls
and bodies to attain our freedom... ♪</i>

01:07:26.629 --> 01:07:34.629
<i>♪ ...and we'll show that we,
brothers, are of the Cossack nation. ♪</i>

01:07:39.434 --> 01:07:40.685
Glory to Ukraine!

01:07:41.186 --> 01:07:42.771
Glory to her heroes!

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:33.089
Please, I appeal to everyone...

01:09:33.548 --> 01:09:36.216
don't respond to this provocation.

01:10:17.801 --> 01:10:20.720
Citizens!
If you approach police...

01:10:22.347 --> 01:10:24.683
we will consider it an attack.

01:10:24.766 --> 01:10:27.936
Therefore we will take
defensive measures against the attackers.

01:10:28.895 --> 01:10:30.647
The government will fall tomorrow.

01:10:30.897 --> 01:10:33.024
A government
against its people can't survive.

01:10:33.858 --> 01:10:36.277
Lay down your shields.

01:10:37.946 --> 01:10:43.159
We've spoken about
Chernobyl as a sort of genocide...

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:46.663
and about the
genocide of the 1930s.

01:10:47.038 --> 01:10:49.124
We are seeing the same schemes.

01:10:49.374 --> 01:10:52.836
Unfortunately we're
seeing the same plague.

01:10:53.086 --> 01:10:59.134
The undead Soviet ghoul
is pushing us toward World War III.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:06.891
Out with the bandits!

01:11:49.142 --> 01:11:50.810
Get behind us, be careful!

01:11:51.895 --> 01:11:54.105
Forward! People, let's go!

01:12:10.288 --> 01:12:16.753
The Revolution has enough
people to throw Molotov cocktails.

01:12:17.796 --> 01:12:20.215
But throwing Molotov
cocktails is something I don't do well.

01:12:21.675 --> 01:12:22.675
I can't do it.

01:12:22.717 --> 01:12:25.887
I think we should put all
our strength into the film...

01:12:26.304 --> 01:12:28.807
which will glorify Ukraine.

01:12:29.265 --> 01:12:31.393
A new Ukraine.

01:12:53.873 --> 01:12:57.919
It was a peaceful protest.

01:12:58.878 --> 01:13:05.677
I picked up a camera in front of my face...

01:13:06.302 --> 01:13:11.516
and shot the faces of riot police.

01:13:13.935 --> 01:13:18.148
The first shot hit the camera.

01:13:18.815 --> 01:13:23.695
The second shot hit my right hand.

01:13:25.947 --> 01:13:29.075
It was all very fast.

01:13:29.534 --> 01:13:33.079
And I fell to the ground.

01:13:33.663 --> 01:13:36.041
I saw a lot of blood...

01:13:37.751 --> 01:13:42.547
and suffering of the
people in the street.

01:13:53.058 --> 01:13:59.564
This is a big trauma
for me and my country.

01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:08.114
I hope it never happens again.

01:14:30.387 --> 01:14:33.682
Why have I decided to
speak out about our information?

01:14:33.932 --> 01:14:36.768
Because fear is a virus...

01:14:36.851 --> 01:14:39.145
and it can destroy
society just like lies.

01:14:39.479 --> 01:14:44.901
If I stay out of
this battle, remain silent...

01:14:44.984 --> 01:14:46.903
I'm supporting evil.

01:14:46.986 --> 01:14:48.905
It means I become a villain.

01:14:58.206 --> 01:15:01.793
Bandits out!

01:15:13.763 --> 01:15:15.724
We have an enemy.

01:15:15.807 --> 01:15:18.184
That enemy is the Soviet Union...

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:23.648
and those who
are striving to bring it back.

01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:31.114
And the Communist Party,
which began with the 1930s genocide...

01:15:32.449 --> 01:15:36.369
also ordered the
Chernobyl genocide of 1986.

01:15:36.995 --> 01:15:40.749
The Chernobyl catastrophe was no accident.

01:15:46.004 --> 01:15:50.425
It was premeditated, planned...

01:15:50.842 --> 01:15:54.971
and smoothly executed by Moscow.

01:15:55.430 --> 01:16:00.435
Because the Chernobyl
accident was arranged...

01:16:00.977 --> 01:16:06.649
to hide the billions...

01:16:07.317 --> 01:16:12.280
wasted on an idiotic,
non-functioning weapon.

01:16:14.949 --> 01:16:19.996
They used Ukrainian
hands to master a genocide...

01:16:26.002 --> 01:16:33.468
when Moscow called and
ordered the staff to explode the reactor.

01:16:33.843 --> 01:16:36.513
We know their names.

01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:40.767
Ukraine is just the first step
in the rebirth of the Soviet Union.

01:16:41.351 --> 01:16:44.062
The second step is World War III.

01:16:46.606 --> 01:16:50.318
Thus, we stand here
not for our country alone...

01:16:50.402 --> 01:16:52.821
but for all humanity.

01:16:56.574 --> 01:16:58.451
Glory to Ukraine!

01:16:58.827 --> 01:17:00.027
Glory to her Heroes!
