there were no Palestinians here.

13:00.197 --> 13:02.157
You know? Zero.
There were Arabs.

13:02.199 --> 13:05.076
And Jews. No Palestinians.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.746
So, I'm... Are you saying
Palestinians aren't real?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.247
I don't understand.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.415
I'm-I'm saying
it's, like, you know...

13:10.457 --> 13:13.168
-It's politics, but...
-Is that because

13:13.210 --> 13:15.337
if they're just Arabs, then they
don't actually have a claim

13:15.378 --> 13:17.464
to this land? They could go...

13:17.506 --> 13:19.382
They could go anywhere, right?
They could go to Jordan

13:19.424 --> 13:20.675

13:20.717 --> 13:22.928
(speaking Hebrew)

13:45.158 --> 13:46.576
-all of us.
-We needed somewhere to go.

13:46.618 --> 13:49.704
We couldn't
just hang around Poland.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.831
One oppression
does not justify another, okay?

13:51.873 --> 13:54.042
We did not need
to make the Palestinians unsafe

13:54.084 --> 13:55.544
so that the Jews
could feel safe.

13:55.585 --> 13:56.920
-That's crazy logic. -MAURA:
You know, there were Jews

13:56.962 --> 13:58.213
in Palestine
way before the Holocaust.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.881
You know that, right?

13:59.923 --> 14:01.383
They came here to escape

14:01.424 --> 14:03.301
the pogroms
that were all over Europe.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.178
I mean, this was...
this was home.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.055
This was safe.
This was a homeland.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.348
Why don't we
just get all the people out,

14:08.390 --> 14:10.016
drop a bomb
on all the buildings,

14:10.058 --> 14:12.936
just start the whole thing over.
And there's nothing

14:12.978 --> 14:14.396
-to fight about anymore.
-It's not about the buildings.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.689
It's about the land.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.691
Oh, my God. Could you guys...
Let's just stop.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.943

-Okay.

14:19.985 --> 14:21.778

enjoy the ride.

-Yeah, you can plug it

17:12.615 --> 17:14.033
-SHELLY: What is that?
-NITZAN: That's, uh,

17:14.075 --> 17:15.493
the hand of Jesus.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.245
-What?
-MOSHE: It's Jesus on his way

17:17.287 --> 17:20.623
to his crucifixion,
rested here

17:20.665 --> 17:23.042
and his hand touched the wall.

17:23.084 --> 17:25.754
LEN: What I don't get is,
if Jesus was the son of God,

17:25.795 --> 17:27.672
then why did he just grow up
to be a carpenter?

17:27.714 --> 17:28.840
It's very moving.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.383
Harrison Ford was a carpenter.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.177
JOSH: I don't get
how she's a virgin.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.221
-Like, was, was Joseph, like,
did he have E.D.? -"E.D."?

17:35.263 --> 17:36.973
-Erectile dysfunction.
-(laughs)

17:37.015 --> 17:38.975
I mean, I just never married,
it doesn't make sense.

17:39.017 --> 17:42.187
SARAH (fading out):
Nobody said they had sex...

17:42.228 --> 17:44.189
God put the baby in her.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.648
JOSH: Oh, yeah, well,
that makes sense.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.275
That, that makes sense.

18:06.085 --> 18:11.341
Jesus Christ, it's like a...
Orthodox Jewish Disneyland.

18:11.382 --> 18:13.176
Well, everybody, stay together.

18:13.218 --> 18:15.845
-JOSH: No can do, Mom.
-Men on one side,

18:15.887 --> 18:17.931
women on the other.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.187
And the men have about
three times as much

18:24.229 --> 18:25.688
-of the wall space, huh?
-JOSH: Len.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.273
-You want to wail at this wall
with me? -You know it.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.399
I'm pretty great at wailing.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.484
Have fun, honey.

18:29.526 --> 18:30.944
Get your groove on.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.237
SHELLY:
Be a good boy, Joshy.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.780
SARAH: All right,
I want to get my prayer on.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.156
Does anyone got any paper?

18:35.198 --> 18:38.243
-Yeah. I got...
-I got-- oh, I have paper.

18:54.509 --> 18:56.511
(indistinct praying)

19:02.058 --> 19:04.978
-Up?
-Yeah.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.867
It's fucking bullshit,
this divide.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.827
Yeah, but it's tradition.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.125
(cheering)

19:27.166 --> 19:29.168
(rhythmic clapping,
singing)

19:44.350 --> 19:46.019

19:54.277 --> 19:56.321
