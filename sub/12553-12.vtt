CLYDE:
<i>13 Bannerman Road is</i>
<i>where Sarah Jane Smith lives</i>

00:07.474 --> 00:10.744
<i>and it's home to things</i>
<i>way beyond your imagination.</i>

00:10.810 --> 00:14.214
<i>There's an extraterrestrial,</i>
<i>super computer in the wall,</i>

00:14.280 --> 00:17.517
<i>her son, a genetically</i>
<i>engineered boy genius,</i>

00:17.584 --> 00:20.387
<i>a school girl investigator</i>
<i>across the road</i>

00:20.453 --> 00:23.823
<i>and a whole</i>
<i>universe of adventure</i>
<i>right here on the doorstep.</i>

00:31.297 --> 00:32.698
-Ready?
-Always.

00:37.504 --> 00:40.240
SARAH JANE: <i>My name's</i>
<i>Sarah Jane Smith.</i>

00:40.306 --> 00:42.342
I'm not an amateur.

00:42.409 --> 00:44.544
I don't think you are either.

00:44.611 --> 00:45.912
I don't care what you think.

00:48.248 --> 00:51.918
What's happening is you're not
in charge any more.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.788
MR SMITH: <i>I am sorry.</i>
<i>You are very ill indeed.</i>

00:56.723 --> 01:00.593
You've got your secret attic.
Welcome to my secret cellar.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.662
Yes, you are ill.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.830
I made you ill.

01:19.112 --> 01:23.216
RUBY: Your life
essence is delicious.

01:23.283 --> 01:27.654
And you're just the starter.
Once it's consumed you,

01:27.720 --> 01:31.891
it'll be big enough to absorb
many more life essences.

01:31.958 --> 01:34.627
Many, many souls at a time.

01:34.694 --> 01:35.895
How?

01:35.962 --> 01:37.230
What are you going to do?

01:37.297 --> 01:39.699
Well, I'm going to
carry on your work.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.468
Well, with one
big difference,

01:41.534 --> 01:44.838
I'll still be tracking aliens
from the attic, yes,
but, um,

01:46.005 --> 01:48.107
I'm going to help them.

01:48.174 --> 01:49.843
Help them? How?

01:50.710 --> 01:52.045
Anyway they like.

01:52.111 --> 01:54.414
They want all the water?
Go ahead, drink up.

01:54.481 --> 01:56.483
Mineral wealth?
That way.

01:56.549 --> 01:59.319
Colonise? (CHUCKLES)
Pick a continent.

01:59.385 --> 02:03.256
-You'll destroy the planet.
-Eventually, yes.

02:03.323 --> 02:06.626
But what an exciting time
humanity will have.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.828
-No!
-(CHAINS RATTLE)

02:10.562 --> 02:14.634
And I will feed
on every drop

02:14.701 --> 02:17.804
of their terror and despair.

02:19.606 --> 02:21.174
I'll get my hair done
like Lady Gaga,

02:21.241 --> 02:23.276
all skewiff,
and then dye it streaked.

02:23.343 --> 02:24.978
No way! This is a wind-up.

02:25.044 --> 02:27.113
-I know one when I hear one.
-(RANI LAUGHS)

02:27.180 --> 02:28.781
CLYDE:
Oh, the door's open again.

02:28.848 --> 02:31.017
RANI: Oi, you're serious.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.585
Sarah Jane, tell Rani she's...

02:35.288 --> 02:37.957
Oh, sorry, Rubes.
Where's Sarah Jane?

02:40.760 --> 02:42.495
Play.

02:42.562 --> 02:45.999
<i>I want you to listen.</i>
<i>Please don't start shouting.</i>

02:46.065 --> 02:49.002
<i>Most important,</i>
<i>don't take it out on Ruby.</i>

02:50.270 --> 02:51.437
What's this?

02:51.504 --> 02:53.439
<i>I nearly got you killed.</i>

02:53.506 --> 02:55.275
<i>You aren't safe</i>
<i>with me any longer.</i>

02:55.341 --> 02:56.976
What? No!

02:57.043 --> 02:59.178
No. Oh, please, no.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.881
<i>This life is</i>
<i>exciting and wonderful.</i>

03:01.948 --> 03:05.018
<i>But it changes you,</i>
<i>and it's hard.</i>

03:05.084 --> 03:07.353
<i>We have a responsibility,</i>
<i>all of us</i>

03:07.420 --> 03:09.522
<i>and the biggest responsibility</i>
<i>is knowing when to stop.</i>

03:09.589 --> 03:11.124
<i>So I'm stopping. I've gone.</i>

03:11.190 --> 03:13.593
What? Gone where?

03:13.660 --> 03:17.664
<i>Ruby is talking my place.</i>
<i>She needs your full trust</i>
<i>and support,</i>

03:17.730 --> 03:21.301
<i>and I know</i>
<i>you'll be mature enough</i>
<i>to give that to her.</i>

03:21.367 --> 03:25.038
<i>Please don't try and find me.</i>
<i>You've been incredible.</i>

03:25.104 --> 03:29.943
<i>Clyde, Rani and Ruby</i>
<i>defending the Earth</i>
<i>from an attic in Ealing.</i>

03:30.009 --> 03:31.744
<i>What could be better?</i>

03:33.112 --> 03:34.948
<i>Goodbye.</i>

03:35.014 --> 03:37.784
That isn't me! That isn't me!
(SOBBING)

03:39.252 --> 03:41.020
You knew about this
and you didn't tell us?

03:41.087 --> 03:43.122
No, Clyde, no!
Look, you heard what
Sarah Jane said.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.158
She wouldn't go
and not tell us!

03:45.224 --> 03:48.394
(STUTTERS) I tried to talk
to her, but she wouldn't
listen. I'm so sorry!

03:48.461 --> 03:49.829
It's not your fault, Ruby.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.064
Luke will know
where she's gone.

03:51.130 --> 03:52.665
No, no, no!
She didn't even tell him.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.267
She knew that he would
talk her out of it.

03:54.334 --> 03:55.868
Luke doesn't know?

03:55.935 --> 03:58.404
I... (SIGHS)
I don't know what to say.

03:58.471 --> 04:01.441
-Just shut up!
-Clyde! Look,
I've just got to talk to him.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.681
(SNIFFLES) Oh!

04:09.816 --> 04:11.584
I'm almost upsetting myself.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.555
Enjoying the show?

04:16.623 --> 04:18.658
They'll find a way
to stop you.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.161
Oh.

04:22.228 --> 04:25.898
The hope of the dying
tastes so sweet.

04:26.165 --> 04:28.701
You've got to
get this message.
You've got to help!

04:29.769 --> 04:31.904
Clyde? Are you okay?

04:31.971 --> 04:33.673
You and your stupid holiday.
You put this in her head.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.508
Now she's gone,
just like my dad's gone,

04:35.575 --> 04:36.876
and it's all your fault!

04:36.943 --> 04:38.778
-But...
-Just stay away from me!

04:48.121 --> 04:49.622
Oh! (GRUNTS)

04:59.899 --> 05:01.334
GITA: Sweetheart...

05:02.101 --> 05:02.835
Rani?

05:04.203 --> 05:06.139
Oh, whatever's the matter?

05:06.205 --> 05:08.274
(SOBBING) It's Sarah Jane.

05:08.341 --> 05:09.709
She's gone.

05:09.776 --> 05:10.910
She's moved away.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.346
What? I only saw
her yesterday.

05:20.286 --> 05:22.321
Well, are you sure, my love?

05:22.388 --> 05:26.592
She's gone, Mum. And she just
left a message with Ruby.

05:26.659 --> 05:30.463
What? Moonlight flit?
That's not her style.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.334
She didn't even tell Luke.

05:35.401 --> 05:39.939
Well, (CHUCKLES)
now I know this is rubbish.
Luke's her son.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.974
The way Sarah Jane
looks at Luke...

05:42.041 --> 05:46.446
Well, it's the same way
I look at you. A mother knows.

05:48.614 --> 05:53.853
I see you two, having a laugh,
sharing your big secret.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.389
Don't think I've not noticed.

05:56.456 --> 06:00.793
You and her,
you have something special.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.963
Sometimes,
I get a bit jealous.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.265
Mum, don't say that.

06:06.332 --> 06:09.836
But Sarah Jane
makes you happy,
and that makes me happy.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.239
You listen to me,
Rani Chandra.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.641
She would never,
ever just run off.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.545
-Where's Ruby?
-MR SMITH: <i>Clyde.</i>

06:19.612 --> 06:22.615
-Tell me.
<i>-I cannot comply...</i>

06:22.682 --> 06:24.417
<i>-Clyde, I...</i>
-Doesn't matter.

06:24.484 --> 06:25.952
Find Sarah Jane.
I'm going after her.

06:26.018 --> 06:29.255
(STUTTERS) <i>I cannot comply.</i>

06:29.322 --> 06:31.824
-What's wrong with you?
<i>-Letter 2.</i>

06:34.060 --> 06:36.863
-Mr Smith?
<i>-Letter 2.</i>

06:36.929 --> 06:38.598
What does that mean?

06:38.664 --> 06:42.401
<i>-Letter 2.</i>
-What, like the alphabet?
The letter "B"?

06:42.468 --> 06:44.604
<i>Letter 5.</i>

06:44.670 --> 06:45.938
<i>Letter 23.</i>

06:46.973 --> 06:49.175
B-E-W.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.977
Beware! Beware of what?

06:52.578 --> 06:56.415
Clyde, are you okay?

06:56.482 --> 06:59.352
I was worried.
What you said before...

06:59.418 --> 07:01.254
Forget it,
we've got to find Sarah Jane.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.256
She doesn't want
us to find her.

07:06.125 --> 07:10.563
<i>-Letter 18... 18.</i>
-What was that?

07:10.630 --> 07:13.065
Mr Smith?
What's the matter with you?

07:17.670 --> 07:22.308
<i>There's nothing wrong.</i>
<i>A minor malfunction,</i>
<i>now rectified.</i>

07:22.375 --> 07:25.044
He was trying to
tell me something.
"Beware" and then "Letter 18".

07:25.111 --> 07:27.280
What's letter 18
in the alphabet?

07:27.346 --> 07:29.782
(GASPING) That's "R"!

07:32.685 --> 07:33.820
For Ruby...

07:35.688 --> 07:36.989
Mr Smith was trying
to warn me.

07:37.056 --> 07:38.157
It's you. You've done this!

07:38.224 --> 07:39.826
You made Sarah Jane go.

07:42.895 --> 07:45.031
-(CLYDE GROANS)
-RUBY: Clyde...

07:45.097 --> 07:47.600
We could've had
so much fun together,

07:47.667 --> 07:49.035
but I can't have you
running to Rani

07:49.101 --> 07:50.636
and I've heard enough
from the Xylok.

07:50.703 --> 07:53.039
-Shut him down, Mr White!
-MR WHITE: <i>With pleasure.</i>

07:53.105 --> 07:56.843
No! Mr Smith! No! Mr Smith!

07:58.211 --> 07:59.645
Oh, get off me!

08:06.619 --> 08:08.855
-Where is this?
-Take a look.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.694
RUBY: Recognise it?

08:14.760 --> 08:16.762
I think that bit's Finland.

08:20.066 --> 08:23.035
This was my prison.

08:23.102 --> 08:24.804
My people exiled me.

08:26.138 --> 08:27.440
We have a...

08:28.741 --> 08:32.712
A hunger. Mine was too strong.

08:32.778 --> 08:34.347
They trapped me
here for eternity

08:34.413 --> 08:36.349
with only a game
system for company.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.684
Only now it's my ship.

08:40.486 --> 08:42.655
This golf ball?

08:42.722 --> 08:46.192
Well, I reprogrammed
the games device.

08:46.259 --> 08:49.428
It took me a while.
A long while.

08:49.495 --> 08:51.564
Mr White?

08:51.631 --> 08:53.266
He's a PlayStation.

08:53.332 --> 08:55.601
He's taken me
to so many places.

08:55.668 --> 08:57.870
But don't go looking for them.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.906
They're sadly no
longer with us.

08:59.972 --> 09:04.043
-But Sarah Jane scanned you...
-Ah, this has a biodamper.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.678
It screened me.

09:05.745 --> 09:08.948
Belonged to a previous friend,
God rest her soul.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.817
-Where's Sarah Jane?
-Ooh!

09:13.486 --> 09:16.355
She's watching us right now.

09:18.491 --> 09:21.227
<i>I was going to</i>

09:21.294 --> 09:25.498
I wanted your love,

And then your despair.

leaving me a message.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.892
I rush down here
and you tell me Mum's gone!

10:26.959 --> 10:28.961
What did you do?
I trusted you.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.763

So it's my fault again?

10:30.830 --> 10:32.698

it's not by chance.

I can't be alone,
you know what that's like.

23:50.695 --> 23:52.030
Don't fall for it,
Sarah Jane.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.833
Oh, Rani!
I wasn't born yesterday.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.870
(BRACELET BUZZES)

23:58.937 --> 24:01.339
This isn't the end.
I'll make you regret this!

24:10.448 --> 24:14.219
You will suffer for this,
Sarah Jane Smith!

24:14.286 --> 24:16.788
COMPUTER VOICE:
<i>Gravity log disengaging.</i>

24:17.589 --> 24:18.456
(GRUNTS)

24:22.327 --> 24:24.663
(SCREAMS)
This world will suffer!

24:35.040 --> 24:37.742
Right, Mr White is
going straight into the safe.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.345
Can't I keep him?
He's just a flashy
games console now.

24:40.412 --> 24:41.479
Nice try. No.

24:41.546 --> 24:43.582
No, Mum.
I didn't see anything.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.951
Probably just
an advert or something.

24:46.017 --> 24:49.154
One of those new
3D games. Yeah!

24:49.221 --> 24:51.957
I'll be home soon, I promise.

24:52.023 --> 24:54.025
-Bye!
-3D games? I like that.

24:54.092 --> 24:56.394
Get Mr Smith to
do a cover story.

24:56.461 --> 25:00.432
MR SMITH: <i>So I take it,</i>
<i>the combined efforts of myself</i>
<i>and K9 were satisfactory?</i>

25:00.498 --> 25:03.902
-You called him K9!
<i>-He's not so bad after all.</i>

25:04.169 --> 25:07.372
<i>-I've met worse.</i>
-K9: <i>It is an equitable</i>
<i>arrangement.</i>

25:07.439 --> 25:08.640
Get a room, boys!

25:09.474 --> 25:11.710
All of you saved me.

25:11.776 --> 25:15.146
Every single one of you
played a part.

25:15.213 --> 25:18.717
Thank you. But don't think
you're having an easy ride.

25:18.783 --> 25:20.151
We've got a planet
to protect.

25:20.218 --> 25:21.519
You sure you're up to it?

25:21.586 --> 25:23.955
Oh, Clyde.
With a team like this?

25:24.022 --> 25:26.424
Yeah, I think
I can go on forever.

25:27.292 --> 25:28.426
(HORN HONKING)

25:28.493 --> 25:30.662
-Oh, that's our ride.
-Our ride where?

25:30.729 --> 25:32.397
Uh, pizza, cinema,
whatever you like.

25:32.464 --> 25:35.433
Well, I think we've
earned one night off.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.903
MR SMITH: <i>Goodbye, Sarah Jane.</i>

25:38.169 --> 25:39.337
CLYDE: Lukey boy.

25:43.108 --> 25:45.844
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

25:48.346 --> 25:51.917
SARAH JANE:
<i>Yes, there are amazing things</i>
<i>up there in the universe.</i>

25:51.983 --> 25:54.986
<i>But they've got</i>
<i>some very stiff competition</i>
<i>down here on Earth.</i>
