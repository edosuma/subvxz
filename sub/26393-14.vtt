WEBVTT

00:02.611 --> 00:05.222
Oh, baby,
look what's in this box.

00:05.266 --> 00:08.051
It's all of Marty and Malcolm's
old school projects.

00:09.052 --> 00:11.359
I remember staying
up all night

00:11.402 --> 00:13.448
helping Malcolm build
this volcano.

00:13.491 --> 00:16.364
You know we even got spaghetti
sauce to shoot out the top?

00:16.407 --> 00:18.148
Aw, I remember.

00:18.192 --> 00:21.543
And Marty scraped it
off the walls with garlic bread.

00:21.586 --> 00:24.241
Those were some good
memories, weren't they?

00:24.285 --> 00:25.329
Yeah.
Real good memories.

00:25.373 --> 00:28.680
Ah, it's trash.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.856
How could you just
throw that away?

00:30.900 --> 00:32.684
Those were some special memories
of Malcolm.

00:32.728 --> 00:34.077
Why we need memories?

00:34.121 --> 00:36.645
The real thing is laying
on our couch right now.

00:38.603 --> 00:39.778
Ha ha!

00:39.822 --> 00:41.476
Look at this, baby,
my old beeper.

00:41.519 --> 00:44.435
You know, I remember
when you used to blow me up

00:44.479 --> 00:48.135
whenever you wanted
a little late-night booty call.

00:48.178 --> 00:49.745
I never had your beeper number.

00:51.442 --> 00:53.618
Well, look at that. You know
what? This ain't even my beeper.

00:54.663 --> 00:57.274
Trash. Yep. Let's go.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.365
Ooh, ahoy, Captain Calvin!

01:01.409 --> 01:03.367
Hey, Dave.

01:03.411 --> 01:04.977
Just getting my daily steps in.

01:05.021 --> 01:07.763
Well, you can get in a bunch
more if you just keep walking.

01:09.808 --> 01:12.333
You know, I am actually
a few steps short.

01:12.376 --> 01:13.725
Good.

01:16.815 --> 01:18.121
Uh, Dave, Dave, Dave, stop that.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.688
You're making me dizzy.
Stop circling me.

01:19.731 --> 01:21.037
Yeah, no problem.
I'll go the other way.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.476
Whoa.

01:25.520 --> 01:26.825
You throwing
all this stuff out?

01:26.869 --> 01:28.958
Yeah, it's just
a bunch of trash.

01:29.001 --> 01:31.265
Well, maybe to you,
but not to everyone.

01:31.308 --> 01:32.614
You know what?

01:32.657 --> 01:33.919
You should have a yard sale.

01:33.963 --> 01:35.530
A yard sale?

01:35.573 --> 01:36.966
In this neighborhood?
I don't think so.

01:37.009 --> 01:39.403
Why, what's wrong
with our neighborhood?

01:39.447 --> 01:41.884
Oh, nothing. Nothing. There's
a lot of good people here.

01:41.927 --> 01:44.104
You know, hardworking,
God-fearing,

01:44.147 --> 01:45.975
and I wouldn't trust
a single one of them.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.152
And I don't want
to waste my time

01:49.196 --> 01:50.980
with a bunch of people
trying to hustle me

01:51.023 --> 01:52.373
so I can make a few bucks.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.810
Hustle you? Oh, come on,
Calvin, that's crazy.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.942
Oh. You want
to hear some crazy? Okay.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.857
You see that
house down there?

01:58.901 --> 02:01.208
They claimed Malcolm
and Marty on their taxes

02:01.251 --> 02:02.731
six years straight.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.387
And see those wires
hanging from there?

02:06.430 --> 02:09.651
That guy is stealing the
other family's cable.

02:09.694 --> 02:12.480
But they're running
an illegal day care,

02:12.523 --> 02:14.656
so they can't say nothing
about it.

02:14.699 --> 02:17.093
Oh, man, I thought
that was a beauty salon.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.486
Oh, yeah, they do that, too.

02:18.529 --> 02:21.097
Look, man,

02:21.141 --> 02:23.099
everybody around here's
just trying to get by.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.058
I just don't want them
getting by on me.

02:26.102 --> 02:28.235
Well, I guess that's how
you and I are different, Calvin.

02:28.278 --> 02:30.933
I choose to believe that
the world isn't out to get me.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.761
Okay. You come see me

02:32.804 --> 02:35.285
once you find out Grover
cosigned for a motorcycle.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.896
Yard sale.

02:37.940 --> 02:41.161
All right, man. I will
tell you, you know,

02:41.204 --> 02:44.686
last yard sale I had,
I cleared a cool grand.

02:44.729 --> 02:46.035
Hold on, hold up.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.038
You made 1,000 bucks?

02:49.081 --> 02:50.082
Oh, yeah. That's right.

02:50.126 --> 02:52.084
Well, ahoy, Dave.

02:53.956 --> 02:56.915
'Cause I know my crap's got
to be worth more than your crap.

02:56.959 --> 02:58.787
I'm having me a yard sale.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.354
Well, you know, I'm
happy to help out.

03:00.397 --> 03:01.790
Well, thank you.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.835
And in return,
I'm gonna do you a solid.

03:03.879 --> 03:07.187
You see that extension cord
running from your attic window?Yeah.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.450
You're supplying the power
to the day care.

03:11.930 --> 03:13.845
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

03:13.889 --> 03:15.151
♪ Welcome to the hood.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.766
Ooh, this is gonna be great.
I can't wait to meet

03:21.810 --> 03:24.943
more of our neighbors.Me, neither.
Especially the ones

03:24.987 --> 03:27.337
named Benjamin,
Washington and Jackson.

03:28.382 --> 03:30.210
All right, Pop.

03:30.253 --> 03:32.603
Here you go. Good luck
with your yard sale, bro.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.605
Hold on, whoa.
Where are you going?

03:34.649 --> 03:35.998
I was going to the library.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.870
Oh, no. No, you and Marty
are in charge of security.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.611
What?

03:40.655 --> 03:42.222
Well, what's it pay?

03:42.265 --> 03:43.658
Room and board.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.009
Fine, I'll start today.

03:47.052 --> 03:50.099
Do I get a weapon?Sure. Yeah.

03:50.142 --> 03:51.100
Here's a whistle

03:51.143 --> 03:52.406
and a wooden spoon.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.538
Don't be afraid
to use them.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.236
Oh, great, Pop.
If a bowl of soup

03:56.279 --> 03:58.368
tries to steal
something, I'm ready.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.851
Hey, you guys.
We picked you up some coffee

04:02.894 --> 04:04.940
and a dozen doughnuts.

04:04.983 --> 04:08.117
Uh, 9 3/4 doughnuts.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.119
See, I told you he was too quiet

04:10.162 --> 04:11.947
in the back of the car.True.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.471
But way to use your fractions.

04:14.515 --> 04:16.168
Hey, hey, look what I found.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.562
A box full of kitchen gadgets

04:18.606 --> 04:20.129
from all those
late-night infomercials.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.652
I remember that stuff.

04:21.696 --> 04:24.089
Whenever that commercial
said "act now,"

04:24.133 --> 04:25.177
your mama did.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.529
I had to. Supplies
were limited.

04:28.572 --> 04:31.967
Marty, put all
that stuff on the dollar table.All right.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.882
Oh, no, no, no,
no. Uh-uh-uh.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.536
You're not selling my
infomercial stuff.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.320
Put that box back
where you found it.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.887
Okay.Come on, Tina.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.584
You've never used
any of this junk.

04:40.628 --> 04:41.933
It's not junk.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.761
And I haven't used
any of it yet.

04:43.805 --> 04:44.936
Marty.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.547
Okay.Marty.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.244
Marty.

04:49.332 --> 04:51.247
Martin Lawrence Butler.

04:52.770 --> 04:54.381
It's not about you,
it's about them.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.557
It's not about you,
it's about them.Boy, give me this box!

04:56.600 --> 04:58.994
There's some good
stuff in here.

04:59.037 --> 05:01.126
Like-like-like this thingy.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.998
Oh, my God, is that
a Choppy Chopper?

05:03.041 --> 05:05.000
I've always wanted
to try one of these.

05:05.043 --> 05:08.351
Finally someone who appreciates
my infomercial instincts.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.222
You never even
tried it yourself.

05:10.266 --> 05:12.224
Well, that all changes
today. Let's go to my house

05:12.268 --> 05:13.922
and choppity-chop something.

05:13.965 --> 05:16.446
Okay, Gemma. Let's go.

05:16.490 --> 05:17.752
Don't wait up.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.454
Well, enjoy that toaster,
my man.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.328
Looks like somebody
got some new teeth.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.506
Hey, Shanice.

05:32.549 --> 05:36.161
You know what, this will make
a great baby bassinet.

05:36.205 --> 05:38.860
You add a few bungee cords,
you got you a car seat.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.297
Throw some sandwiches in there,

05:41.341 --> 05:44.822
you going to a picnic.
Hmm? Look.

05:44.866 --> 05:47.695
Calvin, this is
the best yard sale

05:47.738 --> 05:49.261
I have ever been to.

05:49.305 --> 05:51.089
I've met so many
fantastic people.

05:51.133 --> 05:54.266
Did you know that Anita
was in the Peace Corps?

05:54.310 --> 05:56.617
Or that Mr. Dorsett
just retired from teaching

05:56.660 --> 05:58.401
after 50 years?

05:58.445 --> 06:00.142
A-And Germaine

06:00.185 --> 06:02.318
with the face tattoo?
He says if anybody asks,

06:02.362 --> 06:04.364
that he has been here
all day.

06:09.412 --> 06:11.153
You know, I've
actually been having

06:11.196 --> 06:12.415
a pretty good time, myself.Uh-huh.

06:12.459 --> 06:15.026
I sold everything
on table two,

06:15.070 --> 06:17.289
and then I sold table two.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.422
Oh, oh, man! Well,
what's your secret?

06:19.466 --> 06:20.554
Watch and learn.

06:20.597 --> 06:24.514
Hey, you know,
just so you know,

06:24.558 --> 06:26.560
this grill used to
belong to Tupac.

06:27.604 --> 06:30.259
Yeah, he made a
hell of a rib eye.

06:30.302 --> 06:32.870
You know, one time
he had a barbecue,

06:32.914 --> 06:34.437
and he didn't invite
Biggie, and...

06:34.481 --> 06:36.047
Well, you know the rest.

06:37.092 --> 06:38.528
Oh, okay.

06:40.312 --> 06:42.314
Ah!

06:43.664 --> 06:46.057
Calvin, what're you doing?

06:46.101 --> 06:48.277
You just lied to that guy
for money.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.323
Well, yeah. I mean, I wouldn't
lie to him for no reason.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.325
That would be messed up.

06:56.111 --> 06:57.765
Uh, hey, Marty.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.637
What is with
the sunglasses, bro?

07:00.681 --> 07:02.465
It's a little security
trick I picked up

07:02.509 --> 07:04.119
so nobody can see
where I'm looking.

07:04.162 --> 07:05.773
Right now I got my eye
on that guy over there

07:05.816 --> 07:07.383
licking the
nine-volt batteries.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.909
You know, that's nothing.

07:11.953 --> 07:14.564
A minute ago he was licking
the sewing machine.

07:14.608 --> 07:17.175
Yeah, I better go
shut that down.

07:17.219 --> 07:21.528
Hey, man! Store policy:
you lick it, you buy it.

07:21.571 --> 07:24.226
How you doing,
Miss Simpson?

07:24.269 --> 07:26.315
Well, I'm still
above ground, ain't I?

07:27.795 --> 07:30.493
Listen, how much y'all want
for this porcelain angel?

07:30.537 --> 07:34.541
Well, you know, there's a very
special story about this angel.

07:34.584 --> 07:35.933
When...Cut the crap.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.546
I'll give you
three dollars for it.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.199
How about
four dollars?

07:41.243 --> 07:42.418
How about two dollars?

07:42.462 --> 07:45.987
Okay. Fine, two dollars.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.206
Okay.
Here's a dollar.

07:50.948 --> 07:53.429
You know this is
a Canadian dollar.

07:56.388 --> 07:58.390
Oh, this is awesome.

07:58.434 --> 08:01.306
This is so much fun.
What else can we choppity-chop?

08:01.350 --> 08:03.439
Okay, we've done the fruits,
we've done the vegetables.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.571
Oh, wait, what's this?

08:04.614 --> 08:06.268
I chopped your kitchen sponge.

08:08.749 --> 08:11.403
I get it. Once you start,
you can't stoppity-stop.

08:11.447 --> 08:13.231
Let's try another gadget.

08:13.275 --> 08:14.450
What's next?Okay.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.147
Depends upon what
you're in the mood for.

08:16.191 --> 08:18.889
Mm-hmm.Okay, we've got
our hard-boiled egg sheller.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.500
Oh.Or we have

08:20.543 --> 08:22.023
a bear claw meat shredder.

08:22.066 --> 08:25.592
And we have this
thing that makes

08:25.635 --> 08:28.333
pancakes in the shapes
of presidents.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.859
Oh, it only goes up to Reagan.

08:31.902 --> 08:34.339
Well, it was the '80s.

08:34.383 --> 08:36.080
You just throw
a little maple syrup on it,

08:36.124 --> 08:38.909
and boom! We got Obama. Huh?

08:38.953 --> 08:41.259
Cal! Calvin!

08:41.303 --> 08:44.741
You are not gonna
believe this.What?

08:44.785 --> 08:46.351
I thought that one of your
statuettes looked familiar,

08:46.395 --> 08:47.962
so I went inside
to go look it up

08:48.005 --> 08:50.530
in my guide to antique dolls
and figurines.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.884
Gemma's guide to antique dolls
and figurines.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.320
Look, the point is

08:58.363 --> 09:00.540
it is a genuine Montolfo

09:00.583 --> 09:03.543
worth $1,500.

09:03.586 --> 09:06.807
$1,500? Well, all right!

09:06.850 --> 09:08.373
Which one is it?Oh.

09:08.417 --> 09:11.202
Here you go, look. Right there.
It's the porcelain angel.

09:11.246 --> 09:13.030
The porcelain angel?

09:15.380 --> 09:17.252
Ah!

09:17.295 --> 09:18.383
You were right.

09:18.427 --> 09:20.647
Your crap
is way better than mine.

09:28.872 --> 09:32.963
You sold
a $1,500 Montolfo angel

09:33.007 --> 09:34.922
for one dollar?

09:34.965 --> 09:36.967
A Canadian dollar.

09:38.229 --> 09:40.144
You see, Dave,
this is exactly why

09:40.188 --> 09:41.668
I didn't want to
do a yard sale.

09:41.711 --> 09:43.017
I didn't want to be hustled.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.932
She didn't hustle you.
She made an honest mistake.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.977
And I'm sure if we go talk
to Miss Simpson,

09:47.021 --> 09:48.979
she'll give the angel
back to you.

09:49.023 --> 09:52.200
If you believe that she's
gonna give me something back

09:52.243 --> 09:54.071
worth $1,500,

09:54.115 --> 09:57.379
then I've got Snoop Dogg's
humidifier to sell you.

09:57.422 --> 10:00.904
Okay, well, you're never
gonna get it if you don't try.

10:00.948 --> 10:03.559
Fine. Come on, man.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.301
Hey, boys, look,

10:06.344 --> 10:08.172
Dave and I are leaving,
so I'm promoting you

10:08.216 --> 10:09.913
from security to sales.

10:09.957 --> 10:13.090
You get to keep
half of whatever you sell.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.963
Wait, wait, wait, Pop. But all
the good stuff is gone, man.

10:16.006 --> 10:18.792
I know. That's why
you're getting half.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.794
Malcolm!

10:20.837 --> 10:22.360
Congratulations, brother.

10:22.404 --> 10:23.492
Yeah, for what?

10:23.535 --> 10:24.754
Well, this is
your first promotion.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.452
That's very funny.

10:27.496 --> 10:30.368
You know, we should just
throw all this crap away, man.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.066
Nobody gonna buy any of it.

10:32.109 --> 10:35.460
Here's six dollars.
I just sold a broken cell phone.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.245
What? Wait, hey.

10:37.288 --> 10:38.550
How'd you do that?

10:38.594 --> 10:41.684
I was just pretending
to talk to Batman on it.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.686
Some lady said I was cute
and bought it.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.646
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just because you were cute?

10:46.689 --> 10:47.821
I get that a lot.

10:49.823 --> 10:52.129
I can't believe it.
All of these TV gadgets

10:52.173 --> 10:55.437
actually worked the way
they were supposed to.I know.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.265
And Calvin was giving me
a hard time.

10:57.308 --> 11:01.573
These things were worth
every easy payment of $19.99.

11:01.617 --> 11:03.880
But wait, there's more!

11:03.924 --> 11:07.014
These kitchen knives
can filet a salmon,

11:07.057 --> 11:11.018
slice a soda can
and even cut through handcuffs.

11:11.061 --> 11:13.150
I wish I had known that
on Valentine's Day

11:13.194 --> 11:14.804
when Calvin lost the key.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.374
Wait a minute.
Do you smell smoke?

11:19.417 --> 11:20.723
Are the pancakes burning?

11:20.767 --> 11:22.682
Maybe we forgot to flip Nixon.

11:24.466 --> 11:27.643
No, no, no.
Tricky Dick is looking good.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.735
It's my super slick,
non-stick panini press!

11:32.779 --> 11:34.345
Oh, oh, okay.Wait. Wait. Don't wet it.

11:34.389 --> 11:36.434
Don't wet it too much!

11:36.478 --> 11:38.219
GEMMA: Get out of the way. Okay.TINA: Hit it. Hit it.

11:44.704 --> 11:48.446
Thanks again for letting us
try these at your house.

11:50.100 --> 11:54.017
What am I gonna do with a
30-year-old fax machine?

11:54.061 --> 11:56.411
And is that beef jerky
jammed in it?

11:56.454 --> 11:59.501
Oh, yeah.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.503
Oh. Well,
I-I was six years old

12:01.546 --> 12:03.853
and I tried to fax it
to my brother at camp.

12:06.116 --> 12:08.423
Uh, you know, hey, I'm sorry,
little guy.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.947
Looks like you're gonna have to
wait just a little while longer

12:10.991 --> 12:13.515
to get those, um, eyeglasses.

12:13.558 --> 12:16.518
Yeah, man, the headaches
should go away soon.

12:16.561 --> 12:19.477
It's okay. I understand.

12:21.871 --> 12:24.787
Oh, no.
Oh. No. No.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.442
Excuse me, sir.

12:29.487 --> 12:30.793
Here's a ten.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.534
Get that boy some glasses.

12:32.577 --> 12:34.014
Yes, ma'am.Bless you.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.190
Bless you.God bless you.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.452
How was that?

12:37.495 --> 12:39.149
That was perfect.
Give me some.

12:39.193 --> 12:42.979
Yes. Now, how do we unload
this one Rollerblade?

12:43.023 --> 12:45.242
Huh. Oh, hey,
can you cry on cue?

12:45.286 --> 12:47.723
What do you think?

12:50.073 --> 12:52.684
Oh-ho, I think we
gonna get paid.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.383
I have to tell you,
Miss Simpson,

12:55.426 --> 12:56.819
you have a lovely home.Yes.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.430
Love the plastic
on the couch.

13:01.171 --> 13:03.913
No crumbs in your cracks.

13:05.349 --> 13:06.916
You have to forgive him.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.877
This is only the second
black home he's been in.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.836
The first one didn't
want him either.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.273
So, actually, we're here
because Calvin has

13:16.317 --> 13:18.885
something to tell you about the
angel that you bought from him.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.364
Isn't that right, Calvin?

13:20.408 --> 13:21.931
Well, spit it out.

13:21.975 --> 13:24.499
Unless you got something else
to say about my cracks.

13:27.371 --> 13:30.070
Oh, oh. Okay.

13:30.113 --> 13:33.595
Um... now, I'm gonna be
straight with you.

13:33.638 --> 13:37.294
When I first sold you
that angel figurine,

13:37.338 --> 13:39.775
I didn't realize how valuable

13:39.819 --> 13:41.124
it is...

13:41.168 --> 13:45.172
to... our family,
and no one else.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.565
Really, Calvin?

13:47.609 --> 13:48.566
Yes.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.265
It-it was given
to my grandfather

13:51.308 --> 13:52.875
by a cranky old white lady

13:52.919 --> 13:55.225
he used to drive around
down south.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.749
Now, she was a real
piece of work.

13:57.793 --> 14:00.056
She was...

14:00.100 --> 14:04.321
but they grew to
respect each other in the end.

14:04.365 --> 14:07.803
That sounds just like that movie
Driving Miss Daisy.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.805
Really?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.372
I never seen it.

14:13.374 --> 14:15.767
At any rate, I'm, uh...

14:15.811 --> 14:18.727
I'm willing to buy
the angel back...

14:18.770 --> 14:19.815
for $20.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.210
$20? Good.
I'll get it for you.

14:23.253 --> 14:24.820
Okay.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.388
Good.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.912
I cannot believe
that you lied to her.

14:29.956 --> 14:33.133
I know. I've seen that
movie, like, three times.

14:35.352 --> 14:38.225
Okay, so Dad gets half.

14:38.268 --> 14:41.576
Which means we get to
split the rest.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.796
This is not
a bad Saturday.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.451
I mean, I can almost
pay Mom and Dad some rent.

14:47.495 --> 14:49.758
I'm not.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.847
But I could.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.936
And, Grover, here is a whole

14:53.980 --> 14:56.243
ten dollars.MALCOLM: Yeah, hey, little man,

14:56.286 --> 14:58.810
we could not have
done this without you.Yeah.

14:58.854 --> 15:01.813
I know, which is why
I want more.

15:01.857 --> 15:04.120
Uh, more?

15:04.164 --> 15:05.556
Yeah, like, how much more?

15:05.600 --> 15:07.471
Uh, 50 sounds good.

15:07.515 --> 15:10.257
What?
Are you out of your
rabbit-ass mind?!

15:10.300 --> 15:12.215
I sold everything
you told me to.

15:12.259 --> 15:16.524
I even let those old ladies mess
my hair and pinch my cheeks.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.439
And you think that's
worth $50?

15:18.482 --> 15:21.746
I pretended to be blindfor you.

15:23.052 --> 15:24.793
Malcolm, pay the boy.

15:26.751 --> 15:27.970
Nice try.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.754
This one's Canadian.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.324
Well, that was
one hell of a mess.

15:34.368 --> 15:35.847
Oh, you should have
tried cleaning it up

15:35.891 --> 15:38.198
with the super-absorbent
Sponge-O-Matic.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.635
I did, but after one minute
it started to burn.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.245
I think my thumbprints are gone.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.465
Ugh.
You know,

15:44.508 --> 15:46.336
I hate to say it,
but Calvin was right.

15:46.380 --> 15:48.773
I don't know why I was
so determined to hold on

15:48.817 --> 15:49.774
to all that junk.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.559
Don't beat yourself
up about it.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.691
You're not the only one
who holds on to stuff.

15:54.823 --> 15:56.781
Damn, that's one ugly-ass baby!

15:58.392 --> 16:00.002
Hey, that's Grover.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.834
I paid an artist on Etsy
to capture him on a plate.

16:05.877 --> 16:08.576
You actually spent money
on a Grover plate?

16:08.619 --> 16:14.582
No. I spent money on
a complete setof Grover plates.

16:14.625 --> 16:17.672
Oh, Gemma, these are bad.

16:17.715 --> 16:18.716
I mean,
these are really bad.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.936
Yeah, I know.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.938
Well, you know what it's like
when you're a new mom.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.374
You're sleep-deprived.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.681
I would just order stuff
on Etsy and eBay.

16:26.724 --> 16:29.118
Yeah, I bought all that stuff
off those infomercials

16:29.162 --> 16:31.555
doing my late-night feedings
with my boys.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.993
Oh, man, those first
few months were so brutal.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.777
Ugh.I was exhausted all the time.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.692
Constantly changing diapers.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.346
Covered in spit-up.

16:39.389 --> 16:40.738
It never stopped.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.914
I am so glad that's all
behind me.

16:42.958 --> 16:43.915
So am I.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.961
But, God, I miss it.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.963
Me, too.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.793
He may have looked like this,
but he smelled like heaven.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.186
Oh... And I miss

16:53.229 --> 16:55.710
Marty and Malcolm's
little toes.
Oh...

16:55.753 --> 16:57.755
Now they just have big,
smelly man feet.

16:57.799 --> 16:58.930
Mm.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.020
You know,

17:01.063 --> 17:03.413
maybe I kept all that kitchen
crap because it connects me

17:03.457 --> 17:04.980
to when the boys were little.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.200
Maybe that's why I can't
bring myself to get rid of

17:07.243 --> 17:08.723
these ceramic nightmares.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.769
What's up, ladies?

17:13.728 --> 17:16.296
Anyone wanna see me
make it rain?

17:17.819 --> 17:19.603
Grover!

17:19.647 --> 17:22.867
What...?Oh, no.

17:22.911 --> 17:23.999
You know what?

17:24.043 --> 17:25.827
You might want to have
another one

17:25.870 --> 17:27.263
just in case that one goes bad.

17:30.832 --> 17:33.791
I see you looking
at me, Dave.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.445
And it's not gonna work.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.882
I've already forgiven me.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.236
You know what, Calvin,
you were right.

17:43.279 --> 17:46.674
This neighborhood is full
of scammers and slicksters.

17:46.717 --> 17:49.807
And I'm looking at
the biggest one right now.

17:49.851 --> 17:52.854
I'm sorry, did you
say something?

17:52.897 --> 17:56.597
I was already spending
my angel money in my head.

17:58.512 --> 18:01.732
Well, you know, since I'm
a part of this neighborhood now,

18:01.776 --> 18:03.691
I'm gonna get in on the action.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.043
What are you doing?

18:08.087 --> 18:11.786
I'm stealing from her,
like I learned from you.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.050
Come on, man, put it back.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.008
No. You know what,
as a matter of fact,

18:17.052 --> 18:19.315
I'm taking this
remote control, too.

18:19.359 --> 18:23.145
Have fun standing up to change
your channels, old lady.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.929
Look, stop playing, man.

18:24.973 --> 18:27.367
Old ladies keep guns.

18:27.410 --> 18:30.370
Give it here. Hey...

18:30.413 --> 18:32.241
What the hell are y'all doing?

18:33.895 --> 18:35.418
Oh, nothing.

18:35.462 --> 18:36.898
What's that in your pocket?

18:38.726 --> 18:41.555
Nothing.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.557
Are you trying to steal
from me?

18:43.600 --> 18:46.908
That's it, I'm calling
my grandson Jay-Bo.

18:49.084 --> 18:50.564
He's only got one strike.

18:50.607 --> 18:53.088
Whoa.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.611
Please, please don't do that.

18:54.655 --> 18:58.789
Look, he was only trying to
get me to do the right thing

18:58.833 --> 19:02.228
and tell you that that angel...

19:02.271 --> 19:05.100
was a valuable antique
worth $1,500.

19:05.144 --> 19:09.148
Yes, and he has seen Driving Miss Daisy.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.977
$1,500?

19:13.021 --> 19:16.894
Yeah. Look, sorry for not
being up front with you,

19:16.938 --> 19:20.681
but... seeing
that I have now,

19:20.724 --> 19:24.250
because I'm a good person,

19:24.293 --> 19:25.903
what do you say
we split it?

19:25.947 --> 19:29.211
Well, $750 is a lot of money.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.952
It sure is.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.867
Now, would you see that.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.260
When you give people
the chance...

19:34.303 --> 19:37.350
But $1,500 is a lot more.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.789
Now, y'all get up out of here.

19:41.832 --> 19:42.920
What?
What?

19:42.964 --> 19:44.183
You heard me, beat it.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.968
But, Miss Simpson,
he just told you the truth.

19:47.011 --> 19:48.970
I know, and that's why
I'm giving you

19:49.013 --> 19:52.191
a five-second head start
before I get my pistol.

19:52.234 --> 19:55.281
Okay, hold--
But, Miss Simpson,

19:55.324 --> 19:57.587
I think...Four, three...

19:57.631 --> 20:00.416
Okay, Dave, let's go.
Go, go, go, go, go!

20:08.163 --> 20:10.034
I feel like a fool.

20:10.078 --> 20:12.689
I'm listening.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.604
I honestly thought
if we told her the truth,

20:14.648 --> 20:16.867
that she would do
the right thing.

20:16.911 --> 20:19.087
Well, actually, she did
do the right thing.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.741
I mean, in this
neighborhood,

20:20.784 --> 20:24.135
a five-second head start
is verygenerous.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.964
Well, you know, maybe
she really needed the money.

20:27.008 --> 20:29.706
For medicine, food, rent.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.491
Keep dreaming, Dave.

20:31.534 --> 20:33.188
Because come Sunday,

20:33.232 --> 20:34.929
she is on a church
bus to Vegas.

20:36.539 --> 20:40.195
Well, you know, in that case,
I don't feel so bad.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.501
About what?

20:42.719 --> 20:44.243
I still got her clock.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.159
Well, give it here,

20:48.203 --> 20:50.466
because I paid $1,500
for this thing.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.076
JAY-BO:
Yo, man!

20:52.120 --> 20:54.557
You got my grandma's clock!

20:54.601 --> 20:55.863
BOTH:
Jay-Bo?
