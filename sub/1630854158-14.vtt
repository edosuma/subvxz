10:08.183 --> 10:11.443
1942 to 1989.
Early life and education...

10:11.445 --> 10:14.428
(chuckles) Are you googling him
under the table?

10:14.430 --> 10:18.341
No, I was, uh,
just looking at this dope kale.

10:18.343 --> 10:19.951
Those are collard greens.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.846
Right.
I love all the urban veggies.

10:22.848 --> 10:23.938
Urban veggies?

10:23.957 --> 10:26.958
Okay. You embarrassing
yourself right now.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.868
Look, I'm sorry.

10:28.870 --> 10:29.519
I'm new to all this.

10:29.537 --> 10:31.871
New to being Black?

10:31.873 --> 10:33.614
Yes! I mean, no.

10:33.616 --> 10:36.784
I mean, I'm just trying
to be more convincing at it.

10:36.786 --> 10:40.287
I got the Denzel, I'm wearing
second-hand leather underwear,

10:40.289 --> 10:42.532
and I'm doused
in Michael Jordan cologne

10:42.534 --> 10:44.959
and Michael B. Jordan
aftershave.

10:44.961 --> 10:48.221
Ooh, wow. Okay, there's
a lot to unpack there.

10:48.223 --> 10:51.483
Look, I liked the guy
that I met at the bowling alley,

10:51.485 --> 10:54.093
and I wanted to get
to know him better,

10:54.095 --> 10:56.562
but I don't see
how that's gonna happen

10:56.564 --> 10:58.806
'cause you don't know you.

10:59.734 --> 11:03.477
So take my advice--
it's time to figure that out.

11:03.479 --> 11:07.499
I'll have them wrap up
your oxtails to go.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.250
I was eating what?

11:10.061 --> 11:12.295
(country music playing)

11:25.744 --> 11:26.834
(sighs)

11:27.595 --> 11:28.928
Back early, eh?
You know what they say,

11:28.930 --> 11:33.099
"The shorter the date,
the more it went great."

11:33.101 --> 11:35.360
No! It was terrible.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.438
All she wanted to know about
was the real me.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.348
You mean self-reflection?
Who does that?

11:41.350 --> 11:43.350
Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa,
trust the sign.

11:43.352 --> 11:44.594
Mm-hmm.

11:44.596 --> 11:46.429
I think I know
what she was getting at, but...

11:46.431 --> 11:48.114
See, it's got to do with...

11:48.116 --> 11:49.040
Nah, never mind.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.025
You guys wouldn't understand.

11:51.027 --> 11:52.526
Sure we would.
We're your best friends.

11:52.528 --> 11:55.696
We pee in the same trough
together.

11:55.698 --> 11:57.457
We've melted so much ice.

11:57.459 --> 12:00.944
Just say what you need to say,
eh? We got this.

12:00.946 --> 12:02.762
I'm confused about
my racial identity!

12:04.449 --> 12:06.616
(overlapping nervous mumbling)

12:06.618 --> 12:08.134
(slurping nervously)

12:09.062 --> 12:12.397
Hey, I know avoidance slurps
when I hear 'em.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.457
(slurping)

12:14.459 --> 12:16.626
No, we're perfectly comfortable
talking about...

12:16.628 --> 12:17.736
(whispers):
race.

12:17.738 --> 12:18.719
I mean, I can talk about

12:18.721 --> 12:20.405
(whispers):
race...

12:20.407 --> 12:21.147
(normal volume):
...all day.

12:21.149 --> 12:22.298
Oh, me, personally,

12:22.300 --> 12:23.800
I don't even see...
(whispers): color.

12:23.802 --> 12:27.245
Look, being adopted and raised
by white folks from Iceland,

12:27.247 --> 12:29.155
I've always felt
like an outsider--

12:29.157 --> 12:30.823
not Icelandic enough,
not Black enough.

12:30.825 --> 12:33.826
I mean, hey, sure,
I'm barfly enough,

12:33.828 --> 12:35.328
but that's not enough.

12:35.330 --> 12:38.998
Hey, barflies have
a rich and storied-- (belches)

12:39.000 --> 12:40.467
I don't know anything
about my roots!

12:40.469 --> 12:44.429
That stupid old rodeo
belt buckle was the only thing

12:44.431 --> 12:46.747
I ever got
from my birth parents.

12:46.749 --> 12:48.658
-(sighs)
-The buckle?

12:48.660 --> 12:50.251
But you gave that away.

12:50.253 --> 12:52.328
I know!
It-it was a panic swap!

12:52.330 --> 12:55.756
I thought I could get rid of
this sucky feeling of emptiness,

12:55.758 --> 12:57.758
but now it's worse than ever.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.186
If I'm ever going to be
with someone as great as Naima,

13:00.188 --> 13:02.280
then I need to find out
who I am.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.114
And for the first time
in my life,

13:03.116 --> 13:06.493
the answer isn't in this bar.

13:09.230 --> 13:11.956
(slurping nervously)

13:11.958 --> 13:13.124
<i> (slurping continues)</i>

13:13.126 --> 13:15.585
<i> -(Barney belches)</i>
<i> -(slurping continues)</i>

13:20.025 --> 13:22.358
Carl's never been away
from Moe's this long.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.635
He missed
Public Domain Karaoke Night.

13:23.637 --> 13:26.805
How could I sing
"Toot, Toot, Tootsie, Goodbye!"

13:26.807 --> 13:28.139
without my duet partner?

13:28.141 --> 13:32.477
Well, Carl did open up to you
about some big issues.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.794
Just his identity.

13:33.796 --> 13:36.055
My book club book says
it's important to look at

13:36.057 --> 13:37.965
the discomfort you felt
as an opportunity

13:37.967 --> 13:42.395
to "explore your unacknowledged
privilege."

13:42.397 --> 13:43.396
Oh, buzz words.

13:43.398 --> 13:45.731
Have you even called him?

13:45.733 --> 13:47.158
What am I supposed to say?

13:47.160 --> 13:50.053
Let's start with
what you're not supposed to say.

13:50.055 --> 13:52.055
-"My feelings matter, too."
-Said that.

13:52.057 --> 13:53.222
-"Slavery was a long time ago."
-Thought that.

13:53.391 --> 13:56.242
-"But I love Eddie Murphy."
-Lenny tweeted that.

13:56.244 --> 13:58.152
I just want things
to be normal again.

13:58.154 --> 14:00.396
Oh, that's on the list.

14:00.398 --> 14:02.156
Doesn't the book have
any suggestions

14:02.158 --> 14:03.583
for what I should do?

14:03.585 --> 14:05.735
Hmm. Not to gesture,
not to quote,

14:05.737 --> 14:09.163
not to laugh too hard at,
not to think, not to wear,

14:09.165 --> 14:11.724
not to wear on Halloween,
not to sing along to in the car.

14:13.761 --> 14:16.429
Look, Homer. I know you.

14:16.431 --> 14:18.356
You're never going to say
the right thing,

14:18.358 --> 14:21.359
but that doesn't mean
you should stop trying.

14:31.262 --> 14:33.262
Lenny, are you sure you're okay

14:33.264 --> 14:34.931
with selling
your vintage suspenders

14:34.933 --> 14:36.690
to buy back Carl's buckle?

14:36.692 --> 14:37.876
Well, the doctor says
I should take a break

14:38.044 --> 14:41.028
because of the shoulder grooves
and nipple abrasions.

14:41.030 --> 14:43.364
You guys had
the same idea as me.

14:43.366 --> 14:46.718
You're the best friends a guy
with no sense of self can have!

14:46.720 --> 14:48.961
We're gonna get
that buckle back.

14:48.963 --> 14:50.204
I already sold that buckle.

14:50.206 --> 14:51.614
Aw. Who bought it?

14:51.616 --> 14:54.117
I don't know.
Some white guy who talks funny.

14:54.119 --> 14:57.787
Oh, that could be any of
the weirdos in this town.

14:57.789 --> 14:59.063
-Crinkle me kilt!
-Avast!

14:59.065 --> 15:01.290
Zounds, Horatio.

15:01.292 --> 15:03.960
Damn,
this place gentrified fast.

15:03.962 --> 15:05.403
Look, I don't know
who bought your buckle.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.629
All I know is
I call him the Rich Texan

15:06.631 --> 15:09.799
on account of him being
a rich Texan.

15:09.801 --> 15:12.860
I love buckles. Yeehaw!

15:12.862 --> 15:15.638
-(bullet ricocheting)
-(exclaiming)

15:15.640 --> 15:19.158
While that's doing its thing,
let's talk.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.661
My buckle shows
a cowboy wrestling a bull

15:21.663 --> 15:23.755
and kind of... kissing it?

15:23.757 --> 15:26.240
Oh, that one?
Ain't no smooch.

15:26.242 --> 15:28.742
He's biting its lip.
Bulldogging.

15:28.744 --> 15:30.244
I already flipped it.

15:30.246 --> 15:31.412
Aw! You sold it?

15:31.414 --> 15:35.749
To a pal of mine
who's a real buckle-head.

15:35.751 --> 15:37.677
He said it had
a heapin' helpin'

15:37.679 --> 15:39.604
of historical heritage.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.331
Do you think the guy who bought
it could help me find my roots?

15:42.333 --> 15:45.193
Hmm. Well, it's a long shot.

15:46.762 --> 15:50.114
Fellas, meet the host of
<i> Finding Your Roots,</i>

15:50.116 --> 15:52.675
Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

15:52.677 --> 15:55.453
Dr. Gates,
you're a national treasure.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.105
Please, at best
I'm a regional treasure.

15:58.107 --> 16:01.108
That buckle is a stunning piece
of American history.

16:01.110 --> 16:03.461
What's your connection to it?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.037
Well, all I know is that
after my parents died,

16:05.039 --> 16:07.206
it was in my bassinet
when I was dropped off

16:07.208 --> 16:08.282
at the orphanage.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.452
Other than that,
my heritage is a blank slate.

16:11.454 --> 16:14.197
Solving this kind of
life-defining, soul-affirming

16:14.199 --> 16:16.957
historical riddle is the reason
I created this show.

16:16.959 --> 16:19.368
Tell my next guest
he's bumped.

16:19.370 --> 16:22.555
Ah, it's probably for the best.

16:22.557 --> 16:24.056
<i> ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i> Finding Your Roots.</i>

16:24.058 --> 16:25.875
<i>With Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</i>

16:25.877 --> 16:28.987
Carl, when you look at
this buckle, what do you feel?

16:28.989 --> 16:31.656
I just want to know...
what gives?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.899
Today, you'll hear
the story that answers

16:33.901 --> 16:37.161
that very question:
"what gives?"

16:38.740 --> 16:41.833
What got you started
on this journey of discovery?

16:41.835 --> 16:44.151
An amazing woman I met.

16:44.153 --> 16:46.487
Hey, the most awkward guy
I ever dated is on TV.

16:46.489 --> 16:49.582
Ooh, come on,
mention the restaurant.

16:49.584 --> 16:51.567
<i> I felt like such a fool</i>

16:51.569 --> 16:54.237
<i> as I left with my takeout bag</i>
<i> from SoulHouse.</i>

16:54.239 --> 16:56.830
-(cheers)
-He said it! Ooh, he said it.

16:56.832 --> 16:58.407
Let me introduce you to Ellis.

16:58.409 --> 17:01.001
Ellis! I bet I'm related to him.

17:01.003 --> 17:02.836
I wasn't supposed
to say that yet, was I?

17:02.838 --> 17:04.671
Just act surprised later.

17:04.673 --> 17:05.931
Turn the page.

17:05.933 --> 17:08.842
From this pre-Civil War
document, we know that

17:08.844 --> 17:11.604
<i> your fourth great-grandfather</i>
<i> was born into slavery</i>

17:11.606 --> 17:13.756
<i> on a ranch in Texas.</i>

17:13.758 --> 17:17.684
<i> On what would become</i>
<i> the first Juneteenth in 1865,</i>

17:17.686 --> 17:20.112
<i> Ellis got word that</i>
<i> the Emancipation Proclamation</i>

17:20.114 --> 17:21.188
<i> had freed the slaves</i>

17:21.190 --> 17:23.857
<i> two years earlier.</i>

17:23.859 --> 17:25.601
<i> Angry and determined,</i>

17:25.603 --> 17:27.436
<i> he leapt onto the wildest</i>
<i> stallion on the ranch</i>

17:27.438 --> 17:28.695
<i> and held on for dear life.</i>

17:28.697 --> 17:31.865
<i> Three days later,</i>
<i> and two states over,</i>

17:31.867 --> 17:33.442
<i> that stallion was broken.</i>

17:33.444 --> 17:35.795
<i> But Ellis,</i>
<i> who'd been born a slave,</i>

17:35.797 --> 17:37.221
<i> was not only free,</i>

17:37.223 --> 17:39.965
<i> now he was a cowboy.</i>

17:39.967 --> 17:41.951
Really?
I come from cowboys?

17:41.953 --> 17:46.455
<i> DR. GATES:</i>
<i> My friend, you come</i>
<i> from a long line of cowboys,</i>

<i> That's my dad.</i>

<i>Use it to hold up my Wranglers.</i>
<i> (chuckles)</i>

18:07.420 --> 18:10.404
<i> But then I'm going</i>
<i> to pass it on to my kin.</i>

18:10.406 --> 18:13.257
<i> Folks don't always see us</i>
<i> as cowboys,</i>

18:13.259 --> 18:16.594

<i> he'll know bull riding's</i>
<i> in his blood.</i>

18:20.266 --> 18:23.226
I finally know who I am.

18:28.924 --> 18:30.757
I'm a Black cowboy.

18:30.759 --> 18:31.925
Uh, that's great, Carl,

18:32.186 --> 18:35.596
but does that mean you're
qualified to be doing this?

18:35.598 --> 18:37.431
(bull snorts)

18:37.433 --> 18:39.951
Yeah, what the hell
are you doing?

18:39.953 --> 18:41.435
What I was born to do.

18:41.437 --> 18:44.013
Get killed by
a 2,000-pound super cow?

18:44.015 --> 18:46.866
Guys, don't worry,
I got the buckle.

18:46.868 --> 18:48.351
Uh...

18:48.353 --> 18:50.777
Doctor,
can't you do something?

18:50.779 --> 18:52.446
Sorry, I see this a lot.

18:52.448 --> 18:55.299
Once, I had to pull Laurence
Fishburne out of a jet cockpit

18:55.301 --> 18:58.160

his great-uncle was

18:58.162 --> 19:00.029
a Tuskegee Airman.

19:04.627 --> 19:06.051
(bull snorting)

19:06.053 --> 19:07.961
Carl, don't do this.

19:07.963 --> 19:09.963
You don't need
to prove anything to me.

19:09.965 --> 19:12.708
No, I need to prove it
to myself.

19:12.710 --> 19:15.044
Bull riding is in my blood.

19:15.046 --> 19:16.562

19:51.024 --> 19:52.356
-(laughs)
-(bone cracks)

19:52.358 --> 19:54.433
Uh, is it supposed to do that?

19:54.435 --> 19:55.860
Don't worry, I'll fix that.

19:55.862 --> 19:59.030
My great-great-grandfather was
a doctor in the Civil War.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.847
Get the hell out of here.

20:00.849 --> 20:03.592
One in four cowboys who settled
the Old West was Black.

20:03.594 --> 20:05.852
(chuckles) Oh,
and you know the Lone Ranger?

20:05.854 --> 20:08.764
No, I'm a young person.

20:08.766 --> 20:11.876
Well, he was based on
a real guy, Lawman Bass Reeves.

20:11.878 --> 20:15.362
Maybe it's that you took my
advice and explored your past,

20:15.364 --> 20:18.365
or maybe I just like a man
who does what I tell him,

20:18.367 --> 20:21.702
but I feel very close to you
right now.

20:21.704 --> 20:23.462
Me, too.

20:23.464 --> 20:24.555
Oh, and thanks for
the O-positive, by the way.

20:24.557 --> 20:28.875
So, does this make me
a cowboy, too?

20:28.877 --> 20:30.803
That's not how blood works.

20:30.805 --> 20:32.730
