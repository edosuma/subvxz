WEBVTT

00:09.592 --> 00:12.762
Wow. I didn't even know
we could do that standing up.

00:12.804 --> 00:15.223
I mean, this whole trying to get
pregnant thing is kind of great.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.767
Especially in the shower. Twice.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.853
Easy, now. Once I'm pregnant,
the only thing

00:19.894 --> 00:23.773
that will be happening twice
in one day is me throwing up.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.942
That just killed the mood.
Oh-- Hey, if I jump back

00:25.984 --> 00:27.485
into that bed right now,

00:27.527 --> 00:28.820
we would be back at it
in less than a minute.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.156
Yeah, you're probably right.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.782
And much as I would love
to stay here and break

00:32.824 --> 00:34.534
our record
of five times in one day,

00:34.576 --> 00:36.077
I have a lot of work to do.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.705
Doesn't Fallon Unlimited
just run itself now?

00:38.747 --> 00:41.750
Thank you for minimizing
my contribution to the company.

00:41.791 --> 00:44.127
But no, I'm talking about
Morrell Green Energy.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.296
I'm trying to make the world
a better place, remember?

00:46.337 --> 00:48.298
Although no one
seems to notice yet.

00:48.339 --> 00:51.926
Look what comes up when
you search "Fallon Carrington."

00:51.968 --> 00:53.386
"Oil heiress flaunts

00:53.428 --> 00:55.180
possible baby bump
on Barcelona beaches"?

00:55.221 --> 00:56.890
I mean, I had
just eaten tacos.

00:56.931 --> 00:58.475
And that sarong
was blowing in the wind.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.560
No wonder young women
have body image issues.

01:00.602 --> 01:01.770
Everyone who matters
knows you're pushing

01:01.811 --> 01:03.188
the green energy envelope.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.898
Not really.
But at least I have Jeff.

01:04.939 --> 01:06.691
You know, he's so good with
all that world-saving stuff.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.526
We're strategizing this morning.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.236
I should get back to work
on these script pages.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.614
The movie starts
shooting in two days

01:12.655 --> 01:14.449
and I still haven't
figured out the climax.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.784
Oof. You keep talking like that,

01:15.825 --> 01:17.035
I might want to jump
back into bed.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.828
Oh...

01:23.708 --> 01:27.295
Ah! You just stuck me
with a pin. Now get out.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.713
We'll finish later,
after I get the feeling

01:28.755 --> 01:30.340
back in my ankle.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.008
Everything okay?

01:32.050 --> 01:33.593
I haven't seen you this upset
since your phone

01:33.635 --> 01:35.428
updated itself overnight.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.347
They really should ask first.

01:37.388 --> 01:39.974
PPA is up and flying,

01:40.016 --> 01:41.851
but the airport
isn't finished yet.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.603
I need more money to
speed up construction

01:43.645 --> 01:45.438
so I can stop renting
hangar space.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.898
So I called some banks.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.441
And they said no?
Construction loans

01:48.483 --> 01:50.652
are risky in this economy.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.403
Even with my years
of experience, they're worried

01:52.445 --> 01:54.405
that I have lost my touch,
that I'm not gonna be able

01:54.447 --> 01:55.907
to pay it back.
That's absurd.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.909
But I know you'll figure it out.
You always do.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.327
Now we have my Yale
Future Business Leaders

01:59.369 --> 02:00.537
reunion tomorrow.

02:00.578 --> 02:01.955
It just keeps getting better.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.248
Come on, it'll be fun.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.041
You've been grouchy lately,
and a little

02:05.083 --> 02:06.334
partying might do you some good.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.919
Loosen you up.
I wouldn't even go

02:07.961 --> 02:09.170
if it wasn't my turn to host.

02:09.212 --> 02:10.338
There's no C.A.,

02:10.380 --> 02:12.173
no new airport.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.509
What's the point of small talk
if I have nothing to brag about?

02:14.551 --> 02:16.845
I think your classmates
will forgive you

02:16.886 --> 02:19.389
for not making the cover
of Forbes this year.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.477
But you could make
the cover of GQ.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.855
As long as you go
with a different shirt.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.231
Something a little more modern.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.150
It looks like you wore
this one at Yale.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.737
Thank you for coming.
As a working woman myself,

02:34.779 --> 02:36.406
I know how busy things can get.

02:36.447 --> 02:39.242
Speaking of working,
I just wanted to ask,

02:39.284 --> 02:41.244
w-why are you still doing this?

02:41.286 --> 02:43.329
You mean Alexam? Why not?

02:43.371 --> 02:44.455
Putting aside the fact
that your partner

02:44.497 --> 02:45.957
is a dangerous narcissist,

02:45.999 --> 02:48.001
running your own company
is hard work,

02:48.042 --> 02:50.003
and from what
I've gathered, you're not

02:50.044 --> 02:52.130
particularly hard-working.
Wow.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.591
It's crazy how an insult
sounds so much worse

02:54.632 --> 02:56.676
with a British accent.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.137
I don't mean to be insulting,
I just genuinely don't know why

02:59.179 --> 03:01.347
you would go to the trouble.
Believe it or not,

03:01.389 --> 03:02.891
Adam and I have turned a corner.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.809
Mm.
We actually make
a great team

03:04.851 --> 03:06.186
and I believe in our product.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.021
Besides, what else
should I be doing

03:08.062 --> 03:09.814
with my time?
Enjoying your hobbies,

03:09.856 --> 03:11.983
like, painting dogs

03:12.025 --> 03:14.235
and entertaining and...

03:14.277 --> 03:16.738
manipulating people.
Hmm.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.489
Look, I'm just worried
that you're gonna be upset

03:18.531 --> 03:20.116
when it doesn't work out.
While I appreciate

03:20.158 --> 03:22.327
your slightly
patronizing concern,

03:22.368 --> 03:24.412
you have nothing
to worry about.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.873
The Alexam Miracle Cream
is going to be a huge hit.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.709
You'll see at the launch
party tomorrow night.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.045
I'm looking forward to it.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.840
I had a great idea
on the way over.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.051
Fallon,

03:38.092 --> 03:40.011
there's something I need
to talk to you about.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.512
Sure, just let me go first.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.182
So, I saw this ad
with a cute little dolphin,

03:44.224 --> 03:45.600
which made me think
of the ocean,

03:45.642 --> 03:47.769
which has waves.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.187
Do you see where
I'm going with this?

03:49.229 --> 03:52.190
Not even remotely.
Hydroelectric power.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.025
Underwater turbines. It's
a virtually untapped market

03:54.067 --> 03:56.819
and it could take Morrell
bicoastal and generate new...

03:56.861 --> 03:58.780
I'm leaving the company.

03:58.821 --> 04:01.157
What did you just say?
I need to move on.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.369
Has the world been saved
and nobody told me?

04:04.410 --> 04:06.454
Because that was our goal.
Yeah, I know.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.248
I know, and I'm sorry
to spring this on you,

04:08.289 --> 04:10.625
but it's not something
I planned.

04:10.667 --> 04:15.046
(exhales) A friend of mine
died unexpectedly.

04:15.088 --> 04:18.132
Luna. You met her
at the, uh, racetrack.

04:18.174 --> 04:20.134
Oh, my God, Jeff, I'm so sorry.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.053
It's kind of hit me harder
than I expected.
Well, obviously,

04:22.095 --> 04:23.763
you should take
as much time as you need,

04:23.805 --> 04:26.224
and know that there's
always a spot here for you,

04:26.266 --> 04:29.352
because, well, I need you.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.896
I appreciate that.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.898
But the company's
up and running now.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.651
And I need time to figure out
what's next for me.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.903
Well, I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't disappointed,

04:38.945 --> 04:41.614
but I do understand.

04:41.656 --> 04:44.033
You will be impossible
to replace.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.536
Thank you.
Jacob,

04:46.577 --> 04:48.204
get me Bryce Bayer
the headhunter.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.748
I need résumés for a
Jeff replacement ASAP.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.792
(chuckles)
That was quick.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.295
Could've at least, uh, waited
until I was out of the room.

04:55.336 --> 04:56.671
Oh, but then it wouldn't
have been as fun.

05:02.343 --> 05:05.346
Here you go. I'm officially
returning your earrings.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.806
Although I don't really
get the hurry,

05:06.848 --> 05:09.100
'cause I wasn't gonna
flee the country.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.060
No, but I am.
You remember Charlie, right?

05:11.102 --> 05:14.397
Yeah, your agent/girlfriend?
That's still happening?

05:14.439 --> 05:15.565
Yeah, it's going great.
She just booked me

05:15.606 --> 05:16.858
a modeling gig in Milan.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.067
In frickin' Italy!

05:18.109 --> 05:19.360
Yeah, I-I know where Milan is.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.279
We're leaving tomorrow night.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.947
I'm gonna go
pack right now.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.282
Thank you so much
for bringing these back.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.950
Ugh, don't they
just scream Italy?

05:25.992 --> 05:27.285
(laughs softly)

05:29.787 --> 05:31.205
She seems bubbly.
Her agent just booked her

05:31.247 --> 05:32.707
a gig in Milan.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.292
Really? Charlie?

05:34.334 --> 05:35.918
Why do you say it like that?
Well, I'm dating

05:35.960 --> 05:37.545
one of her clients, Sasha,
and it seems like Charlie

05:37.587 --> 05:39.589
is skimming more than
her fair share of profits.

05:39.630 --> 05:42.091
I hope she's not doing
the same thing to Kirby.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.720
D-Did you ask her?
No.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.638
We're not exactly on
the greatest of terms right now.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.057
But if Charlie's
scamming our friend,

05:49.098 --> 05:50.975
then we owe it to her
to do something.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.728
Maybe all Kirby needs
is a really good lawyer.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.730
BRYCE:
Is everything okay?

05:55.772 --> 05:58.691
No. This fertility smoothie
tastes like sewage.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.694
I hate kale.
And everything else in here.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.655
But these candidates you're
showing me are not much better.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.866
I thought you were the best
recruiter in town, Bryce.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.701
I am not looking

06:08.743 --> 06:12.163
for a new employee, I am looking
for a new Jeff Colby.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.332
Meaning what? They need to look
great in a turtleneck?
No. Meaning,

06:14.374 --> 06:16.376
somebody who cares about people,

06:16.417 --> 06:18.044
and the environment.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.588
You know, all that crap.
Jeff was that moral compass

06:20.630 --> 06:22.882
I needed to be a positive force
in the world.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.093
Find me a new compass.
I can get you new potentials,

06:25.134 --> 06:27.512
though hearing you talk
about Jeff Colby that way,

06:27.553 --> 06:29.222
I'm surprised
he's moving on to Big Pharma.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.349
What did you just say?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.393
I heard he's looking
for a job in that sector.
Hold on. Are you sure

06:33.434 --> 06:36.229
you didn't hear him say
he's looking for a "big farm"?

06:36.270 --> 06:37.605
Because he told me

06:37.647 --> 06:39.774
he needed time alone.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.859
Oh, my God.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.152
He's lying to me?

06:43.194 --> 06:45.154
And used his dead
friend to prey

06:45.196 --> 06:46.572
on what little empathy I have?

06:46.614 --> 06:47.782
Who is he meeting with?

06:47.824 --> 06:49.158
I only heard rumors.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.618
And it's probably
not even a real thing.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.662
I just assumed you knew.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.748
I should go.
No, no, no.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.625
You are not going
anywhere, Bubba.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.294
I will shove this
disgusting mulch

07:00.336 --> 07:03.339
down your throat
unless you write down

07:03.381 --> 07:07.468
exactly where, when and with
whom my cousin is meeting.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.762
Pick your poison.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.514
♪ ♪

07:18.438 --> 07:20.148
Where did you get these?
This is Alexam's exclusive

07:20.189 --> 07:22.275
product launch, not a three-
year-old's birthday party.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.318
Try again.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.945
ADAM:
Mother? We have an issue

07:25.987 --> 07:28.698
with the Miracle Cream shipment.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.032
Did they forget to put
my signature on the packaging?

07:30.074 --> 07:31.784
I knew I should have
reminded them.

07:31.826 --> 07:32.952
As much of a tragedy
as that would be,

07:32.994 --> 07:34.370
we have an actual problem.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.414
The driver delivering
the shipment

07:36.456 --> 07:38.082
lost control, flipped the truck

07:38.124 --> 07:39.917
and now all of the product
is at the bottom

07:39.959 --> 07:43.588
of the Chattahoochee River,
and the driver is in the ICU.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.381
All of it?

07:45.423 --> 07:47.216
Yes, yes, thoughts and prayers
to the driver,

07:47.258 --> 07:48.634
but what about our party?

07:48.676 --> 07:50.261
We can't have a
product launch

07:50.303 --> 07:52.013
without product.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.347
Why did you wait until
the last minute to ship it?

07:53.389 --> 07:55.475
I was playing hardball.

07:55.516 --> 07:56.767
Look, there's no need
for finger-pointing.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.978
Uh, we'll just pay
a little extra

07:59.020 --> 08:01.063
for rush delivery
of a second batch.

08:01.105 --> 08:04.275
All right, uh, yeah,
I can handle that.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.652
I know the manufacturing team
well now.

08:06.694 --> 08:09.280
They, uh...
They respect my authority.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.532
Perfect. You deal with that, and
I will go over the guest list

08:11.574 --> 08:12.742
to make sure everyone

08:12.783 --> 08:14.702
who is anyone is coming.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.580
Sammy Jo invited a bunch
of influentials for us.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.665
I think you mean "influencers."

08:19.707 --> 08:22.960
Exactly. See,
we make a great team.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.588
Amanda doesn't know
what she's talking about.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.590
Well, that's something
we can definitely agree on.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.843
You want a slice?

08:30.885 --> 08:32.220
We're going to Italy.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.137
We'll be eating
Italian food for a week.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.014
Yeah, but it's pizza.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.850
Good point.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.852
What a surprise running
into you two here.

08:39.894 --> 08:43.314
Oh, I am starving.
You don't mind, do you?

08:43.356 --> 08:45.107
Okay, well, I guess we don't.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.901
Charlie, you remember Amanda.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.736
She's the one who helped me
with the shampoo commercial.

08:48.778 --> 08:49.820
CHARLIE:
Oh, right.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.322
The art nouveau photographer.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.407
So you're also an acting coach?

08:53.449 --> 08:55.409
No, no, just a photographer,
slash, uh, lawyer, actually.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.245
Which reminds me. I'm curious,

08:57.286 --> 08:59.038
do you have the same basic
agreement for all your clients?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.915
'Cause I know
you're taking,

09:00.957 --> 09:02.708
what, like, 40% from Sasha?

09:06.420 --> 09:08.047
If you really are a lawyer,

09:08.089 --> 09:09.298
you know I can't discuss
my client's deal

09:09.340 --> 09:11.259
without them present.
Right.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.802
I respect that.

09:12.843 --> 09:14.512
But Kirby's here,
so w-what about her contract?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.472
'Cause we could all take
a look at that together.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.766
Uh, Amanda, what are you doing?

09:18.808 --> 09:21.394
Are you Kirby's lawyer?
I'm her friend who's
looking out for her.

09:21.435 --> 09:22.979
It feels more like you're
accusing me of something,

09:23.020 --> 09:24.355
and I'm not sure
I like the implication.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.774
KIRBY:
Okay, let's all relax.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.651
Amanda, where is this
coming from?

09:28.693 --> 09:29.860
Look, I just know
that things get hidden

09:29.902 --> 09:31.612
in the fine print,

09:31.654 --> 09:33.614
and I don't want you
to be taken advantage of.

09:33.656 --> 09:36.075
I can assure you,
Kirby's in very good hands.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.454
This is a huge deal
for me and Charlie,

09:40.496 --> 09:41.789
and I trust her.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.708
I'm a big girl.
I can look after myself.

09:44.667 --> 09:45.876
Of course. Right.

09:45.918 --> 09:49.422
(clears throat)
I'm sorry, uh...

09:49.463 --> 09:51.757
Enjoy your pizza.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.764
Honestly, I was expecting
cheap department-store quality,

09:58.806 --> 10:00.182
but this isn't bad at all.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.226
Since you're consulting
on our party for free,

10:02.268 --> 10:04.854
I will accept
the backhanded compliment.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.439
Yeah, you need to pay
if you want normal compliments.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.357
But I am
thrilled to help.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.985
I need to take
my mind off things.
Oh, right.

10:11.027 --> 10:14.363
I'm sorry to hear about
your whole new sick father deal.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.656
Your concern is touching.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.074
And it's okay,
he's being treated

10:17.116 --> 10:18.868
by some of the best
doctors available.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.661
So, uh...

10:20.703 --> 10:23.080
when can I try this Miracle
Cream I keep hearing about?

10:23.122 --> 10:25.625
I need help fighting
these stress lines.
Soon.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.501
Right now, I need
to figure out what to do

10:27.543 --> 10:30.838
about the lack of RSVPs from
the Peach Tree Society members.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.424
Well, I can tell you
what to do about that.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.010
Be grateful.
That is not the crowd you need.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.845
And it won't mix well with mine.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.264
Look at this.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.724
What is that?

10:41.766 --> 10:44.018
That club is all over
the Internet now.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.187
This is what these people can
do for you tomorrow night.

10:46.228 --> 10:48.898
It's what advertising
looks like nowadays.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.358
And they do this just for free?

10:50.399 --> 10:52.193
Influencers can be
somewhat entitled,

10:52.234 --> 10:55.529
so if you can throw in some
swag bags, free samples,

10:55.571 --> 10:57.073
whatever, they can definitely
make your business

10:57.114 --> 10:59.867
an overnight success
with a single hashtag.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.452
I do like the sound of that.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.079
Oh, and I had this great idea

11:03.120 --> 11:04.747
for a literal
Fountain of Youth...

11:04.789 --> 11:06.374
(mouthing)

11:06.415 --> 11:08.209
...filled with your product.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.543
And I have this
fountain guy.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.253
I need to call him.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.506
All right, bad news,
the manufacturer

11:13.547 --> 11:16.550
can't make another batch of
product in time for the party,

11:16.592 --> 11:18.636
so unless you're planning
on filling that fountain

11:18.678 --> 11:20.680
with water, we should
probably postpone.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.473
Unacceptable.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.141
The PR machine
has already started.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.686
Sammy Jo dropped the invite,
whatever that means.

11:26.727 --> 11:27.937
I have an idea.

11:27.978 --> 11:30.856
It's your formula.
Grab a lab coat,

11:30.898 --> 11:32.942
work with the chemists
and whip up a batch in-house.

11:32.983 --> 11:36.070
I love how all your great
ideas mean more work for me.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.700
So, how big do we want
the fountain to be?

11:42.410 --> 11:44.120
Plenexia seems like
a perfect fit for me.

11:44.161 --> 11:45.788
I'd love an opportunity

11:45.830 --> 11:48.040
to really shake things up
in the pharmaceutical industry.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.458
Any examples
you'd care to share?

11:49.500 --> 11:51.585
FALLON:
Yeah, Jeff,
I think we'd all like

11:51.627 --> 11:54.004
to hear your thoughts
on Big Pharma.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.507
Fallon. What are you doing here?

11:56.549 --> 11:57.883
Oh, I'm just checking in.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.635
Seeing how all the depression
is going.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.137
Is this your therapist?
Aren't you Fallon Carrington?

12:01.178 --> 12:02.596
Right you are.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.682
Jeff worked for me
up until this morning.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.808
I thought

12:05.850 --> 12:07.560
that he was taking
some time off,

12:07.601 --> 12:09.353
but clearly I was wrong.
JEFF:
Yeah, Fallon, we're kind of

12:09.395 --> 12:11.480
in the middle of something here.
I can explain it all later.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.232
What is there to explain?
You lied.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.900
You told me
you needed time alone.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.570
I didn't realize that meant
time alone at a new job.

12:17.611 --> 12:19.947
This is making me uncomfortable.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.741
Whatever is
going on here,

12:21.782 --> 12:23.868
it's clear you two
need to figure it out.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.536
And when you do,

12:25.578 --> 12:27.913
please don't call.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.540
Marvin, please,
just-just wait a second.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.879
What is the matter with you?

12:34.920 --> 12:36.213
With me?

12:36.255 --> 12:38.215
I am not the one
who used a friend's death

12:38.257 --> 12:40.176
to get out of working together.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.344
I didn't lie.
I was trying to get a job

12:42.386 --> 12:43.763
at Plenexia because of Luna.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.431
She had
neurotoxicity, too,

12:45.473 --> 12:47.516
but she couldn't afford
to pay for her meds

12:47.558 --> 12:49.727
because of the manufacturer's
insane markup.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.646
(exhales)
The manufacturer being...

12:52.688 --> 12:54.774
Plenexia.
I needed that job

12:54.815 --> 12:56.817
so I could get
their drug formula.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.487
I wanted to make them pay
for what they did to Luna

12:59.528 --> 13:01.822
and ensure it never happens
to anyone else again.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.407
Jeff, why didn't
you just tell me this?
Because it's illegal,

13:03.449 --> 13:05.534
and you'd have tried
to talk me out of it.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.119
But now we don't have
to worry about that.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.538
Because you ruined
the only chance I had

13:09.580 --> 13:11.707
to make Luna's death matter,
so thanks.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.428
(both laugh)

13:24.470 --> 13:25.971
What's so funny?

13:26.013 --> 13:28.265
Oh, there you are.
This is Henry.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.184
He was just showing me
this Jeff Bezos video

13:30.226 --> 13:33.771
with a Taylor Swift song
playing, but different words.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.481
Yeah, I don't get it.
Oh, well, the--

13:35.523 --> 13:36.774
You just have to know the song.
Since I don't,

13:36.816 --> 13:38.651
are you, um,
are you ready to go?

13:38.692 --> 13:40.194
I've done about
as much hosting as I can.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.612
I've got to get back to work.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.030
We just got here.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.532
Remember, you're supposed
to be loosening up.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.325
Oh, there she is.
Cristal, Blake,

13:46.367 --> 13:50.704
before you go, allow me
to introduce my wife.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.874
Sonya Jackson? Wow.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.876
Look at you. Oh...

13:56.877 --> 13:58.879
Blake Carrington, finally.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.381
BLAKE:
Uh, Cristal,
this is Sonya,

14:00.422 --> 14:01.715
my very good friend from Yale.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.843
And Sonya, this is
my wife Cristal.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.928
SONYA:
I'm so glad we caught you.
I've been bobbing

14:05.970 --> 14:07.888
and weaving my way through small
talk just trying to get to you.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.599
Now we can get
the party started,

14:10.641 --> 14:12.476
like we did in the old days.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.521
I wish we could, but Blake
here needs to get back to work.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.814
Don't be ridiculous.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.148
The sun hasn't even set yet.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.150
Come on, you can
stay a little longer.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.152
Oh, I know.
Blake can tell us the story

14:22.194 --> 14:25.155
about how he brought two dates
to a formal by mistake,

14:25.197 --> 14:27.116
but, you know,
went back and forth

14:27.157 --> 14:30.494
and never got caught.
Oh.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.079
I'd like to hear that story.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.581
I didn't want to hurt
anyone's feelings.

14:33.622 --> 14:34.957
If you think about it,
I was being polite.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.333
Oh, please,
all you did

14:36.375 --> 14:37.835
was break young girls'
hearts back then.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.128
Which you're probably
still doing today,

14:39.169 --> 14:41.255
by the looks of you.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.841
Yeah, uh, maybe we can
stay for a little while.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.844
Mother.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.888
The chemists and I
were up all night,

14:48.929 --> 14:50.848
and day, but we pulled it off.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.266
Oh, thank God.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.768
I never doubted you for a...

14:54.810 --> 14:55.769
jar.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.771
Where is the rest?

14:57.813 --> 14:59.565
There is no rest. This is it.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.025
Do you know how
difficult it is

15:01.066 --> 15:02.443
to make this stuff?

15:02.484 --> 15:05.446
No, that is your area
of expertise.

15:05.487 --> 15:06.989
Or at least,
I thought it was.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.991
What the hell am I supposed
to do with one jar?

15:09.033 --> 15:11.201
Sam's people won't promote
product they don't have.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.953
(sighs)

15:12.995 --> 15:14.705
Now we have to cancel.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.832
I need to call the office
and tell them to stop prepping.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.876
(chuckles)
Maybe Amanda was right.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.961
Maybe I should
go back to painting.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.631
No, we can figure
this out. Just...

15:23.672 --> 15:25.674
Okay. If anyone
knows how to work

15:25.716 --> 15:27.635
with the hand
they've been dealt, it's you.

15:27.676 --> 15:28.636
Come on.

15:28.677 --> 15:31.013
True.

15:31.055 --> 15:34.308
We just... need to work
with what we've got.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.769
It's not about quantity,
it's about

15:36.810 --> 15:39.355
presentation
and manipulation.

15:39.396 --> 15:42.316
Two areas in which I excel.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.612
(softly):
Baby, baby, baby, baby...

15:53.202 --> 15:54.828
Fallon?

15:54.870 --> 15:57.373
Hey! Um...

15:57.414 --> 15:59.583
What are you doing in here?
I mean, is everything okay?

15:59.625 --> 16:01.001
Yeah, I feel like I should be
asking you that.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.670
You seem
a little on edge.
Me?

16:02.711 --> 16:04.797
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I just...

16:04.838 --> 16:07.091
You know, I'm just thinking
about Jeff leaving the company.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.009
Sometimes I
have a tendency

16:09.051 --> 16:11.053
to make things all about me,

16:11.095 --> 16:12.930
and it can backfire.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.348
This is where
you're supposed to say,

16:14.390 --> 16:17.267
"No, Fallon, you don't do that."
(laughs)

16:17.309 --> 16:19.645
Oh, you still want me
to say that, or...
No.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.231
No, just forget it.
The point is, I ruined something

16:22.272 --> 16:24.400
that Jeff wants,
and I'm trying to make it right,

16:24.441 --> 16:26.402
but no one at Plenexia

16:26.443 --> 16:28.487
will return my calls.
I'm impressed.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.240
You're usually not this upset
about other people's problems.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.369
Unless there's
something else going on.
Hmm?

16:35.411 --> 16:38.872
No. No, no, no,
no. Just me.

16:38.914 --> 16:40.416
Growing. Um...

16:40.457 --> 16:42.084
But I want to
talk about you.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.961
I mean, how's the writing going?

16:44.003 --> 16:46.547
Ugh, terrible.
I-I-I can't figure anything out.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.549
I tried calling Culhane for
advice, but he was no help.

16:48.590 --> 16:49.967
So I just-- I don't know,
I think I'm screwed.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.635
Oh, I'm sure
it's not that bad.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.303
You've read the
script, right?
Mm-hmm.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.930
Okay. I just need
to find a way

16:54.972 --> 16:56.849
to get Farrah in
this final boardroom scene.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.434
Now, it seems simple, but
it's a house of cards.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.227
And as soon as I come
up with one solution,

17:00.269 --> 17:02.312
everything falls apart.
Well, maybe
you're thinking

17:02.354 --> 17:04.231
about it in the wrong way.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.483
I mean, maybe Farrah
doesn't have to be

17:06.525 --> 17:08.110
in the scene at all.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.571
If you can't get her
into the boardroom, then...

17:10.612 --> 17:12.114
Then what?

17:15.951 --> 17:17.619
Jeff? No, no, no, no. Stop.

17:17.661 --> 17:19.329
Don't hang up on me.
Listen,

17:19.371 --> 17:23.000
I think I may have found a way
to get you what you want.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.127
Just don't make
any plans tonight.

17:26.503 --> 17:30.299
I'm so sorry, I have to go,
but thank you.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.633
For what?

17:34.136 --> 17:35.929
MICHAEL:
You've done the best you can.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.639
If Kirby respects Charlie,
then there's nothing we can do.

17:37.681 --> 17:38.849
Their relationship
is none of our business.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.934
Um, I beg to differ.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.311
That woman was extremely dodgy

17:42.352 --> 17:44.021
when I brought up
those contracts, okay?

17:44.063 --> 17:45.689
If she's robbing Kirby,
then we have to expose her.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.733
Even if Kirby specifically
asked you to butt out?

17:47.775 --> 17:49.401
Unless there was
some other reason

17:49.443 --> 17:51.445
that you're dying
to get involved

17:51.487 --> 17:53.655
that you're not
willing to share.

17:53.697 --> 17:55.032
No, I'm just protecting Kirby.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.200
She's clearly blinded
by lust, okay?

17:56.241 --> 17:57.826
You know what?

17:57.868 --> 17:59.119
She's gonna be grateful when
we prove that her girlfriend

17:59.161 --> 18:01.163
is just a liar with bad hair.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.040
Aren't they getting on a plane
to Milan tonight?

18:03.082 --> 18:05.209
Yes, that does
complicate things.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.212
If I could just get a look
at the contract somehow, then...
(sighs)

18:08.253 --> 18:09.546
I may regret saying this.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.173
Sasha told me
that Charlie

18:11.215 --> 18:13.217
keeps a copy of all
her contracts on her phone

18:13.258 --> 18:15.219
in case she ever needs
to pull anything up.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.554
Okay, well,
that's brilliant news.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.307
I-I just need to get
my hands on that phone.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.934
(gasps)
You know something else.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.061
Okay, out with it.
Come on, no turning back.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.854
Sasha may have also said

18:25.896 --> 18:27.689
that she and a
few other models

18:27.731 --> 18:29.858
that Charlie reps are working
the Alexam launch party tonight.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.860
Okay, so Charlie's
gonna be there?

18:31.902 --> 18:33.487
Okay, great, so we just
show up to the party,

18:33.529 --> 18:37.074
we swipe the phone,
we forward Kirby's contracts

18:37.116 --> 18:38.367
and then we just delete
all the evidence

18:38.408 --> 18:39.576
so that she doesn't notice.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.245
It's so simple.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.497
This is not sounding
like a "we" type of situation.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.082
I'm not comfortable
with any of this.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.000
Right, and I totally respect
your wishes, I do,

18:47.042 --> 18:48.627
I do. Um...

18:48.669 --> 18:50.045
I am gonna need you
to distract Charlie, though,

18:50.087 --> 18:52.172
so I can get my hands
on that phone.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.925
So you don't actually respect
my wishes. At all.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.052
It's a two-man job.
Oh, come on.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.720
We owe Kirby as friends.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.597
You'd better be
right about this.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.307
I'm already
on thin ice with her.

19:02.349 --> 19:05.519
And he says, "Blake? I thought
you were in Mont Blanc."

19:05.561 --> 19:07.312
(laughter)

19:09.231 --> 19:11.024
I had no idea you were
such a bad boy back then.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.985
Oh, well...
Oh!

19:13.026 --> 19:15.279
He was such a blast.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.740
You know, I thought my
ex-husband was, you know, fun,

19:18.782 --> 19:20.033
until I woke up
one morning

19:20.075 --> 19:23.120
and realized
he was a boring old man.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.872
But luckily,
I found Henry,

19:24.913 --> 19:27.583
who has his youthful zest
for life.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.001
BLAKE:
Yeah, I think you mean

19:29.042 --> 19:30.752
he still has his youth.

19:30.794 --> 19:31.879
Well, it's good to see
you're still young at heart,

19:31.920 --> 19:33.881
despite being older.

19:33.922 --> 19:36.175
Well, I think Cristal
keeps me young.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.718
I try.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.178
I had to drag him out
of the manor tonight.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.513
SONYA:
Well, I'm glad she did.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.683
You still clean up nice,
and you look as vibrant as ever.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.771
BLAKE:
Well, I think
we better get going.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.481
Seems like the party's
winding down.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.985
Oh, I was hoping
we would spend more time

19:55.027 --> 19:58.155
and to get to know
each other more intimately.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.616
Let's get together soon.
We need more couple friends.

20:00.657 --> 20:02.868
I've been trying to get
Blake to an Atlantix game.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.411
HENRY:
Oh, that sounds fun, but, uh,

20:04.453 --> 20:08.999
Sonya had something a bit
more private in mind.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.417
BLAKE:
Well, don't worry,
it's a private box,

20:10.459 --> 20:12.794
and, uh, it'll be
just the four of us.

20:12.836 --> 20:14.213
SONYA:
That's exactly
what I had in mind

20:14.254 --> 20:16.590
for tonight.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.467
My husband and I
are going to continue

20:18.508 --> 20:20.427
this party in our suite.

20:20.469 --> 20:24.056
We have a king bed,
and it has plenty of room

20:24.097 --> 20:25.557
for two more people.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.100
We do hope
you'll join us.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.490
(dance music playing)

20:45.160 --> 20:46.662
Well, this seems to be
going well, right?

20:46.703 --> 20:49.665
Everyone seems to be
having a good time.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.250
ALEXIS:
Only because they don't realize

20:51.291 --> 20:52.668
there's no product yet.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.795
Hey. My influencers
are getting antsy.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.880
Where's the Miracle Cream
they all came here for?

20:56.922 --> 20:58.340
Also, where's my jar?

20:58.382 --> 20:59.341
I have something
planned for them.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.176
They need to be patient.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.095
Patients are for hospitals,
not exclusive parties.

21:03.136 --> 21:04.763
This is the social
media elite.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.140
Which means they are
all spoiled children

21:07.182 --> 21:09.184
with attention deficit
disorders, so if you don't

21:09.226 --> 21:11.436
start handing out free stuff,
you're gonna have a riot

21:11.478 --> 21:12.437
on your hands.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.815
What is...
Oh. Oh, God.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.984
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you all for coming.

21:17.025 --> 21:20.862
I am Alexis Colby,
founder of Alexam Corp...

21:20.904 --> 21:22.739
(clears throat)
Cofounder,

21:22.781 --> 21:24.533
along with my son Adam.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.827
I know you all are eager to try

21:26.868 --> 21:29.204
our groundbreaking
Miracle Cream.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.789
But instead of just
handing out samples

21:30.831 --> 21:33.792
like some cheap
department store,

21:33.834 --> 21:36.461
we have something
a little more exciting planned.

21:36.503 --> 21:37.671
Ladies.

21:37.713 --> 21:40.090
(people oohing)

21:40.132 --> 21:42.509
A little friendly competition.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.137
When you post
with the hashtag Alexam,

21:45.178 --> 21:47.055
you will receive an empty jar

21:47.097 --> 21:48.598
from our Fountain of Youth
display.

21:52.060 --> 21:55.272
Each has a colored seal
under the cap.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.857
Oh, I get it. It's
like Squid Game,

21:56.898 --> 21:58.775
but with lotion
instead of blood.

21:58.817 --> 22:01.945
ALEXIS:
Red means you're out
of the running.

22:01.987 --> 22:05.657
Black means you get another jar
with another post.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.534
But if you find the blue seal,

22:07.576 --> 22:09.953
you will be the first
to try our product,

22:09.995 --> 22:14.833
and win a lifetime supply
of Miracle Cream.

22:14.875 --> 22:15.917
(whoops, laughs)

22:15.959 --> 22:18.211
(scattered applause)

22:20.881 --> 22:24.051
As well as a cash prize
of $1 million!

22:24.092 --> 22:25.969
(cheering)
(laughs):
Oh, my...

22:29.181 --> 22:32.601
(chuckles)
Let the game begin.

22:32.642 --> 22:34.603
♪ Party on the weekend,
party on the house... ♪

22:34.644 --> 22:36.730
(phone ringing)

22:38.648 --> 22:40.484
Hello?
WOMAN (over phone):
Is this Charlie Jiménez?

22:40.525 --> 22:41.985
I'm calling from the airline.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.737
Unfortunately,
your flight to Milan tonight

22:43.779 --> 22:45.197
has been canceled,
and we just need to rebook you

22:45.238 --> 22:46.615
on a different one
to leave in the morning.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.909
What? Why was it canceled?

22:48.950 --> 22:50.869
Actually, never mind,
just book it

22:50.911 --> 22:52.704
and make sure both seats
are still first-class.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.247
May I place you on a brief hold?

22:54.289 --> 22:56.333
(phone beeps)
No, I'd rather...

22:56.375 --> 22:57.542
Hey, Charlie.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.294
Hi. I'm not sure
that we've met.

22:59.336 --> 23:00.879
I'm...
Michael Culhane,

23:00.921 --> 23:02.881
the one who used to date Kirby.
That's right.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.550
So, listen, uh, I saw Sasha
at the buffet table,

23:05.592 --> 23:07.427
and her face is
looking really puffy.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.179
I think she might be having
some kind of reaction?

23:09.221 --> 23:11.390
Was she by the raw bar?
She's allergic to shrimp.

23:11.431 --> 23:12.766
And she has a shoot tomorrow.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.976
I need to find
the EpiPen in her bag.

23:15.018 --> 23:17.813
Um, I can hold your phone
for you if that helps.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.731
So you can give
her the shot.
Um...

23:19.773 --> 23:21.942
You know what? I got
no signal over there before.

23:21.983 --> 23:23.944
Look, I'm on hold,
can you just stay on the line,

23:23.985 --> 23:25.362
and when the woman
comes back,

23:25.404 --> 23:26.780
tell her to book it
and email me the details.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.907
Yeah, you got it. Sure.

23:30.867 --> 23:33.787
I was so much nicer than
normal customer service reps.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.539
Yeah, you should get a job
at an airline. Will you hurry up

23:35.580 --> 23:37.082
and find those
contracts?

23:40.210 --> 23:41.503
KIRBY:
Amanda!

23:43.755 --> 23:46.842
Kirby. What a surprise.

23:46.883 --> 23:49.594
CRISTAL:
So, should we call the car?

23:49.636 --> 23:52.389
Yeah. Mmm, I guess so.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.057
What else are we gonna do?
Mm.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.268
Unless you're still interested
in Sonya's proposal.

23:56.309 --> 23:59.062
(both laugh)
She was probably kidding, right?

23:59.104 --> 24:02.023
Oh...
And you'd never go for
something like that anyway.

24:02.065 --> 24:04.401
I mean, I'm adventurous.
I can be young and hip.

24:05.694 --> 24:06.903
That something you would go for?

24:08.238 --> 24:09.781
I don't know.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.533
Don't you think
we're a little past

24:11.575 --> 24:13.201
the point of experimenting?

24:13.243 --> 24:14.786
Well, you make it sound
like we're 80 years old.

24:14.828 --> 24:19.332
I think it would be exciting
to open up our marriage.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.129
You were the one that said
you wanted to party, and that

24:24.171 --> 24:25.922
I should loosen up, but hey,
if you want to go home,

24:25.964 --> 24:27.257
I get it.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.842
I am not afraid
to try new things.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.510
And if we're
being honest,

24:30.552 --> 24:33.388
our sex life hasn't
quite been the same

24:33.430 --> 24:35.223
since the whole
Rita situation.

24:35.265 --> 24:39.644
Maybe a little adventure is
just what the doctor ordered.

24:39.686 --> 24:42.230
So... So we agree.

24:42.272 --> 24:43.607
We're really doing this?

24:43.648 --> 24:46.443
(laughs softly)
Looks like it.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.819
(chuckles)

24:49.779 --> 24:51.448
You really think
this is gonna work?

24:51.490 --> 24:54.409
Yeah. Why put Farrah
in the boardroom scene

24:54.451 --> 24:57.913
when she can just bribe
one of the VPs instead?

24:57.954 --> 25:00.248
Sorry, Liam movie thing.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.876
What I'm saying is, you don't
need to get a job at Plenexia

25:02.918 --> 25:06.588
when you can just blackmail
someone who already works there.

25:06.630 --> 25:11.426
Okay, that right there is
Dr. Hewitt, but she goes by TJ.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.762
She is the lead chemist
over at Plenexia.

25:13.803 --> 25:15.263
And she thinks she's here
because she won

25:15.305 --> 25:16.890
some free giveaway
from Alexam.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.600
What kind of giveaway?

25:18.642 --> 25:20.560
A fake one. I told her
her name was randomly selected

25:20.602 --> 25:22.521
from a list of people
in the pharmaceutical industry

25:22.562 --> 25:24.773
to attend a launch party
for the new Miracle Cream.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.066
Okay. You had a busy day.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.984
It wasn't even that hard
to convince her.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.654
This one rarely leaves
the house, so she was thrilled.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.781
She'll give you
that formula, Jeff.

25:32.822 --> 25:35.659
We just need to apply
the proper leverage.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.743
KIRBY:
I didn't really want to come,

25:36.785 --> 25:38.245
but I thought I should show up

25:38.286 --> 25:39.704
and be a supportive girlfriend
for Charlie,

25:39.746 --> 25:40.997
you know?

25:41.039 --> 25:42.499
She truly doesn't deserve you.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.584
You might be right.
I can't even find her.

25:44.626 --> 25:45.794
Have you seen her?

25:45.835 --> 25:47.712
Uh, Charlie? No.

25:47.754 --> 25:49.589
No? Hmm.

25:49.631 --> 25:50.924
I'm gonna text her.

25:53.176 --> 25:55.178
(phone chiming)

25:56.096 --> 25:57.764
Wait, that's...

25:59.432 --> 26:01.059
Why do you have Charlie's phone?

26:07.607 --> 26:09.067
This is great. Thank you.
FALLON: Hey.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.694
I'm Fallon Carrington,

26:10.735 --> 26:12.696
and you must be TJ.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.239
I hear you're
Alexam's big winner.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.907
Ms. Carrington,
thank you so much.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.409
I never win anything.

26:17.450 --> 26:19.411
Or really
go out to parties.

26:19.452 --> 26:21.705
Well, not anymore.
I mean I used to, at Duke,

26:21.746 --> 26:24.958
but you know how it is:
marriage, kids, mah-jongg.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.835
Tell me about it, sister.
You know, sometimes a girl

26:26.876 --> 26:29.045
just needs to drop the tiles

26:29.087 --> 26:30.255
and let loose,
am I right?

26:30.297 --> 26:32.632
I have been dying to let loose.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.093
Oh, yeah? I'm glad to hear that,
because I think

26:35.135 --> 26:37.053
that hunk of a male model
behind me

26:37.095 --> 26:38.805
wants to have
a little fun.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.348
Fun with me?

26:40.390 --> 26:42.642
Yeah, you bet your
cat-frame glasses he does.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.060
I'll introduce you.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.270
(chuckles):
Oh, uh, I don't know.

26:45.312 --> 26:46.479
Oh, please. Live a little.

26:46.521 --> 26:48.064
Do it for the Tar Heels.

26:48.106 --> 26:50.275
W-We're the Blue Devils.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.611
Ah, that's even better.
Hey, so, TJ,

26:52.652 --> 26:55.071
this is Scott, and I
think Scott would love

26:55.113 --> 26:56.531
to do a shot with us.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.491
Hi. Okay, great.
Yeah?

26:58.533 --> 26:59.826
All right.
Can we get a round of shots?

26:59.868 --> 27:00.869
Thank you.

27:00.910 --> 27:02.996
Here you go.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.080
To letting loose.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.541
To letting loose.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.084
(giggles)

27:11.046 --> 27:12.464
(exhales)

27:12.505 --> 27:15.008
Ooh.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.302
Ah. Get into it. Mm.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.805
Oh. In she goes.

27:20.847 --> 27:23.016
Look at that.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.226
CHARLIE:
I should call the police,

27:25.268 --> 27:27.145
or at least file
a restraining order.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.480
I didn't try and steal
your phone, okay?

27:28.521 --> 27:29.856
It's not even
the latest version.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.483
Then why did you have it
in the first place?

27:31.524 --> 27:32.400
CHARLIE:
She clearly got it
from your friend Michael,

27:32.442 --> 27:33.860
who was holding my phone

27:33.902 --> 27:35.570
while I dealt with
Sasha's allergy,

27:35.612 --> 27:37.030
which, of course,
was a false alarm.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.948
Okay, but don't
be mad at Culhane.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.325
I-I made him do it
because I was just

27:40.367 --> 27:41.785
trying to take a look
at your contract.

27:41.826 --> 27:44.245
I think she's scamming
you out of money.

27:44.287 --> 27:46.122
You're nuts!
You don't even know me.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.415
I know you're taking
more of Sasha's earnings

27:47.457 --> 27:48.917
than you should be.

27:48.958 --> 27:50.752
When I took Sasha on,
she was a liability.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.796
No one wanted
to work with her.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.547
She was a diva,
rude, constantly disappearing

27:54.589 --> 27:55.965
before wrapping a shoot.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.134
Now I have to pay
her completion guarantee

27:58.176 --> 28:00.637
out of pocket
if she wants a job.

28:00.679 --> 28:01.846
AMANDA:
Look, I was...

28:01.888 --> 28:03.181
just trying to protect you.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.432
KIRBY:
Did it ever
occur to you

28:04.474 --> 28:06.142
that I might read
through my contract

28:06.184 --> 28:08.061
before agreeing
to anything?

28:08.103 --> 28:10.397
That I'm not
a complete moron?

28:10.438 --> 28:12.565
It's a fair deal.
I signed it two hours ago.

28:12.607 --> 28:14.567
SONYA:
We have a flight to catch,

28:14.609 --> 28:16.444
which I'm assuming is not
actually cancelled?

28:16.486 --> 28:17.696
I'm her manager

28:17.737 --> 28:19.322
and her girlfriend.

28:19.364 --> 28:22.659
Kirby doesn't need anyone else
protecting her.

28:23.576 --> 28:24.744
For the first time

28:24.786 --> 28:26.121
in a really long time,

28:26.162 --> 28:27.580
I'm actually happy.

28:27.622 --> 28:29.040
I thought you
of all people

28:29.082 --> 28:30.500
would want that for me.
I do.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.752
Kirby, just let me explain.

28:35.422 --> 28:36.965
Comfortable?

28:37.006 --> 28:38.591
Oh, yeah. Why wouldn't I be?
So comfortable. Thank you.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.176
Good. Henry's just getting
out of the shower.

28:40.218 --> 28:42.846
He'll be ready in a minute.
Great.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.223
Okay. Clean is good.
Quick question,
are either of you

28:45.265 --> 28:46.891
allergic to artificial flavors?

28:46.933 --> 28:49.894
Uh... Not that I'm aware of.

28:49.936 --> 28:51.563
Perfect.

28:51.604 --> 28:53.231
Then as soon as you finish
your drinks, we'll, uh,

28:53.273 --> 28:55.650
move to the bedroom.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.742
Don't keep us waiting.

29:03.783 --> 29:06.077
(stifled laugh)
Artificial flavors? Seriously?

29:06.119 --> 29:08.496
I don't know what that means.

29:08.538 --> 29:10.123
I hope it's not grape.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.292
Be honest.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.710
Are you starting
to have second thoughts?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.712
Me? No.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.630
No, I'm-I'm into it if you are.

29:17.672 --> 29:19.716
Okay, well, if this
is what you want,

29:19.758 --> 29:21.009
then we will plow ahead,

29:21.050 --> 29:22.177
so to speak.

29:22.218 --> 29:23.636
Well, hold on, I-I never said

29:23.678 --> 29:25.305
I wanted to swing
with a random couple.

29:25.346 --> 29:28.057
I'm only doing this because
I thought you liked the idea.

29:28.099 --> 29:31.227
Well, didn't you say you wanted
me to be more adventurous?

29:31.269 --> 29:32.729
I just wanted you
to wear a different shirt.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.147
But then I saw you all
hot and bothered with Sonya,

29:34.189 --> 29:36.441
and it seemed like
you had decided

29:36.483 --> 29:38.067
that this was what you needed.

29:38.109 --> 29:39.944
Yeah, I'll admit that
it was nice to be admired,

29:39.986 --> 29:41.070
but that's all it was.

29:41.112 --> 29:42.655
I was only doing this

29:42.697 --> 29:43.782
to impress you.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.283
You impress me every day.

29:46.868 --> 29:49.412
And honestly? I just want
to get in bed and relax.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.914
Our bed, not theirs.

29:50.955 --> 29:52.415
Well, then, what the hell
are we still doing here?

29:52.457 --> 29:54.542
SONYA (distant):
Are you two coming?

29:54.584 --> 29:56.294
Don't make me get the paddle.

30:04.636 --> 30:08.097
Hey, TJ. There's someone
I'd like to introduce you to.

30:08.139 --> 30:10.642
Ooh, another model? Yummy.

30:10.683 --> 30:12.268
Should we get some shots again?

30:12.310 --> 30:15.396
No, this is my cousin Jeff.

30:15.438 --> 30:16.606
And he's not here
to make out with you.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.149
Oh.
JEFF:
But I am here

30:18.191 --> 30:19.067
to talk to you, Doctor.

30:19.108 --> 30:20.109
About what?

30:20.151 --> 30:21.653
What's going on here?

30:21.694 --> 30:22.904
I need the molecular formula

30:22.946 --> 30:24.531
for Plenexia's
neurotoxicity treatment.

30:24.572 --> 30:27.450
What? I can't give you that.

30:27.492 --> 30:28.785
Is this part of the giveaway?

30:28.827 --> 30:30.078
Because I don't
really get it if it is.

30:30.119 --> 30:31.663
FALLON:
The thing about the giveaway

30:31.704 --> 30:33.706
is that there isn't one.

30:33.748 --> 30:36.042
I just needed an excuse
to get you out of the house

30:36.084 --> 30:37.085
and at this party.

30:37.126 --> 30:38.545
Are you crazy?

30:38.586 --> 30:41.631
All this just to ask me
for the formula?

30:41.673 --> 30:43.216
And to take this picture

30:43.258 --> 30:45.301
if you decided
to say no.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.638
Oh, wow. Wow.
That is unfortunate.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.808
Especially since I know your
divorce isn't final yet.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.269
It would be a real shame if this
were to fall into the hands

30:54.310 --> 30:56.563
of, I don't know, say,
your soon-to-be ex?

30:56.604 --> 31:00.024
JEFF:
Hey, look, we don't want anyone
to see this, either, okay?

31:00.066 --> 31:01.067
So if you just
hand over the formula,

31:01.109 --> 31:02.861
the picture gets deleted.

31:02.902 --> 31:05.864
Go ahead, send the photo
to whoever you want.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.576
That's not the way
this was scripted.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.369
Do you know how evil
that company is?

31:11.411 --> 31:14.163
Their price gouging
killed my friend.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.457
And you two are such saints?
You just tried to blackmail me.

31:16.499 --> 31:17.709
Yeah, but for a good cause.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.377
I know the people I work for.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.546
Believe me, I'm not loyal,
I'm scared.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.006
You don't mess with them.
Excuse me.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.799
Uh, TJ?

31:24.841 --> 31:27.427
TJ, wait.

31:27.468 --> 31:29.846
Forget the photo, okay?

31:29.888 --> 31:32.515
We were never gonna send it.
And I know you're scared.

31:32.557 --> 31:36.811
I get it, because... I just
found out I'm pregnant.

31:36.853 --> 31:40.148
And I want to
make things better

31:40.189 --> 31:43.902
for my kid, but the world
is a really messed up place,

31:43.943 --> 31:45.361
so we have to be the
ones to take the risk,

31:45.403 --> 31:47.196
otherwise, our kids

31:47.238 --> 31:49.407
are just gonna have
all the same problems.

31:49.449 --> 31:52.577
So we have to be
the brave ones, for them.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.371
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.290
It was a good speech,
though.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.208
Congrats on the pregnancy.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.507
Pleasure. #Alexam.
That's right. #Alexam.

32:06.549 --> 32:09.052
(pop music playing)

32:09.093 --> 32:11.220
Here you go.
Thank you.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.431
Hey!
Come on, baby.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.767
I got it.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.435
The blue seal. I won!

32:17.477 --> 32:19.145
H-Hey.
That should have been mine.

32:19.187 --> 32:20.688
You cut me off.

32:20.730 --> 32:21.940
Ladies, I'm-I'm sure
we can work this out.

32:21.981 --> 32:24.275
WOMAN:
It's in my hand,

32:24.317 --> 32:26.194
so it's mine.

32:26.235 --> 32:27.779
SAM:
Ooh, this isn't good.

32:27.820 --> 32:30.114
(women muttering)

32:30.156 --> 32:31.366
Let go!

32:32.408 --> 32:33.242
(people gasping)

32:33.284 --> 32:35.119
Oh, wow.

32:35.161 --> 32:37.372
This is turning
into a PR nightmare.

32:37.413 --> 32:38.998
You better stop it now.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.625
What am I supposed to do?
They're wild animals.

32:40.667 --> 32:41.709
SAM:
Well, it's your party
and your company.

32:41.751 --> 32:43.836
If you can't stop it, who can?

32:45.880 --> 32:47.173
SAM: Okay...
(shouting)

32:47.215 --> 32:48.883
Where'd it go?

32:48.925 --> 32:51.511
(excited chatter)

32:51.552 --> 32:52.595
SAM:
Oh, my God.

32:52.637 --> 32:55.139
WOMAN:
Look out! Ow! Ow!

32:57.225 --> 32:59.477
(all gasping)

32:59.519 --> 33:01.104
(excited chatter)

33:01.145 --> 33:02.438
What is...?
Oh, no. No.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.610
ALEXIS:
There you are.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.199
ALEXIS:
Take it. You won.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.909
I got it. I won!

33:16.911 --> 33:18.204
We have a winner!
Congratulations!

33:18.246 --> 33:21.207
ALEXIS:
Thank you all for coming.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.792
It's been a fabulous night.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.293
SAM:
Does this mean

33:24.335 --> 33:27.088
I get the lifetime supply?
Not a chance. Okay!

33:31.676 --> 33:33.511
I'm so glad we came back home.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.930
I don't know what
I was thinking tonight.

33:35.972 --> 33:37.807
Really? Because I think you do.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.101
Okay, you're right.

33:41.436 --> 33:46.190
I guess I was feeling,
um... out of date.

33:46.232 --> 33:48.735
Boring.
Why?

33:52.321 --> 33:54.574
When the bank denied me, I felt
like I was being pushed out

33:54.615 --> 33:56.284
of a younger man's game.

33:56.325 --> 34:01.080
And then Sonya kept talking
about her old, boring ex.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.207
If you ever feel the need
to describe me that way,

34:03.249 --> 34:04.959
you just put me
out of my misery.

34:07.128 --> 34:09.255
I love you.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.632
And one thing
you'll never be is boring.

34:11.674 --> 34:14.010
You've just
been in a funk.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.263
But if I wanted polygamy or
someone to go clubbing with,

34:17.305 --> 34:18.681
I would've chased after boys.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.559
I prefer a man

34:21.601 --> 34:24.479
who can make things happen,
and that's you.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.109
You're right.

34:32.361 --> 34:33.488
This will just take a second.

34:38.493 --> 34:41.370
Tim? Yeah,
it's Blake Carrington.

34:41.412 --> 34:43.206
I know it's late,
so I'll be brief.

34:43.247 --> 34:45.291
If Skadden Bank
wants my business,

34:45.333 --> 34:47.794
which will soon be worth
billions-- that's with a B--

34:47.835 --> 34:51.172
that loan had better be approved
by end of the day tomorrow,

34:51.214 --> 34:54.175
or I will take my business
somewhere else.

34:54.217 --> 34:55.968
Good night.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.929
Now, that was hot.

35:00.598 --> 35:04.102
Well, now that that's settled,
maybe we get back

35:04.143 --> 35:05.895
to our business.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.856
(both laugh)

35:10.483 --> 35:13.611
I'm sorry my speech
didn't exactly pan out.

35:13.653 --> 35:16.489
I don't suppose I could convince
you to come back here now?

35:17.782 --> 35:21.619
No, I didn't think so,
but it was worth a shot.

35:21.661 --> 35:23.162
Okay, are we just not

35:23.204 --> 35:25.081
gonna talk about the fact
that you're pregnant?

35:25.123 --> 35:28.709
Do people know? Is it a secret?

35:28.751 --> 35:30.711
I'm not pregnant.
I mean, you know,

35:30.753 --> 35:32.505
Liam and I are trying,

35:32.547 --> 35:34.090
just not yet.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.676
I only said that to tug
at TJ's heartstrings.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.928
Damn. So you can't even blame
your craziness on hormones.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.429
Hey.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.181
Hot tip, you are not allowed

35:42.223 --> 35:44.600
to blame female hormones
for anything.

35:44.642 --> 35:46.936
Point taken.
(clears throat)

35:46.978 --> 35:49.981
No, it's just that
all my legacy-building plans

35:50.022 --> 35:52.441
are not exactly
panning out, you know?

35:52.483 --> 35:54.569
I thought by now I would
be ridding the world

35:54.610 --> 35:57.321
of fossil fuels and be
the queen of philanthropy,

35:57.363 --> 36:00.575
that Liam and I would have
a baby on the way, but...

36:00.616 --> 36:02.410
so far I'm O for three.

36:02.451 --> 36:06.122
Okay, uh, what does my leaving
have to do with any of that?

36:06.164 --> 36:07.456
Because you're my compass, Jeff.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.333
I mean,

36:09.375 --> 36:11.627
how am I gonna know what to do
if you're not right by my side

36:11.669 --> 36:13.629
pointing me
in the right direction?

36:14.881 --> 36:17.091
'Cause your heart's
in the right place.

36:17.133 --> 36:19.468
You proved that tonight,
when you tried to extort

36:19.510 --> 36:21.429
that nice lady for me.
Technically,

36:21.470 --> 36:25.266
it was blackmail, but thank you.
That means a lot.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.185
As far as pregnancy stuff goes,

36:27.226 --> 36:30.104
you should really talk
to your husband about that.

36:30.146 --> 36:33.399
And you're not listening,
which is one thing I won't miss.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.276
No, I'm sorry, I just...
I got this text

36:35.318 --> 36:36.485
from an unknown number.

36:36.527 --> 36:37.778
Look at this. It's a location.

36:39.488 --> 36:42.325
A specific lab
in Plenexia headquarters?

36:43.284 --> 36:45.077
This has got
to be from TJ.

36:45.119 --> 36:47.205
And it must be where
they keep the formula.

36:48.247 --> 36:50.416
I guess my speech
actually worked.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.252
And now, can I give
you a little speech

36:53.294 --> 36:54.587
about not doing this?

36:54.629 --> 36:56.005
I know you think you have to do,

36:56.047 --> 36:57.340
but Jeff, you
have to remember,

36:57.381 --> 36:58.633
these are
dangerous people.

37:00.551 --> 37:01.969
I'll be careful.

37:02.011 --> 37:03.471
I promise.

37:09.393 --> 37:10.478
Are you all right?

37:10.519 --> 37:12.104
You usually start
with a glass.

37:12.146 --> 37:15.107
(sighs) Sam's influencers
took down their posts.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.777
So basically, we have

37:17.818 --> 37:21.113
no advertising the night
before our website goes live.

37:21.155 --> 37:25.534
I should've known I didn't
have what it takes to do this.

37:25.576 --> 37:28.704
Maybe it's best you just run
what's left of the company

37:28.746 --> 37:30.539
on your own.
Don't say that.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.375
This was a-a minor speed bump.

37:32.416 --> 37:33.834
Mm-mm.

37:33.876 --> 37:35.753
It feels like
a brick wall to me.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.004
All I wanted

37:37.046 --> 37:38.881
was to prove to my children--

37:38.923 --> 37:41.801
and myself, mostly--

37:41.842 --> 37:45.346
that I could succeed
in business,

37:45.388 --> 37:47.556
but I couldn't even
throw a party.

37:47.598 --> 37:50.559
Well, I thought the party game
was a brilliant move.

37:50.601 --> 37:53.354
We were backed into a corner,
and you didn't give up.

37:53.396 --> 37:56.857
And making Sam
the winner was genius.

37:56.899 --> 38:00.069
You saved us a million dollars
and prevented a riot.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.404
I'm proud of you.

38:01.445 --> 38:03.322
You don't got nothing
to prove to no one.

38:03.364 --> 38:05.783
Thank you, sweetheart.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.285
Besides, I'm not
so sure the party

38:07.326 --> 38:08.911
was as big a failure

38:08.953 --> 38:10.705
as you think it was.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.210
"Atlanta socialite

38:16.252 --> 38:18.421
"Alexis Colby's
beauty line launch

38:18.462 --> 38:22.216
"ends in mad scramble for merch.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.302
Ooh.
Guests go rabid
for radiance"?

38:24.343 --> 38:26.178
See? You were right.

38:26.220 --> 38:27.388
People want
what they can't have.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.098
And who needs
a hashtag

38:29.140 --> 38:30.766
when you got press like this?

38:30.808 --> 38:33.436
(giggles)

38:33.477 --> 38:37.356
I was crazy to doubt myself.
Of course I have what it takes.

38:39.608 --> 38:40.985
Mmm.

38:42.194 --> 38:44.155
Still at it, I see.

38:44.196 --> 38:45.573
There is no way
I'm gonna be able

38:45.614 --> 38:47.074
to deliver these pages
by tomorrow.

38:47.116 --> 38:48.909
(exhales)
I'm in huge trouble.

38:48.951 --> 38:50.244
Mm.

38:50.286 --> 38:51.704
Oh, how'd things go with Jeff?

38:51.746 --> 38:53.247
Everything worked out,
for once.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.499
Who knew being emotionally
honest with others

38:55.541 --> 38:57.501
could be so effective?

38:57.543 --> 38:59.628
Most people?
All right, well,
on that note,

38:59.670 --> 39:03.299
I took a pregnancy test earlier,

39:03.341 --> 39:04.842
and it was negative.

39:04.884 --> 39:06.927
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

39:08.137 --> 39:10.473
I'm-I'm fine, I just...

39:12.391 --> 39:14.810
I didn't tell you right away
because I was disappointed,

39:14.852 --> 39:18.022
and I didn't want you
to be disappointed, too.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.524
I'm not worried.
Okay? We'll get there.

39:20.566 --> 39:24.153
And plus, this just gives us
an excuse to keep trying.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.237
You won't hear me complain.

39:25.279 --> 39:27.948
You know, I was fake pregnant

39:27.990 --> 39:32.203
for just a minute tonight
and I got to say, it felt right.

39:32.244 --> 39:33.746
That's it.

39:33.788 --> 39:35.790
That's how I get Farrah
into the family business

39:35.831 --> 39:37.917
in the boardroom scene.

39:37.958 --> 39:39.377
Uh, she fakes a pregnancy,

39:39.418 --> 39:41.504
forcing her mother-in-law
to accept her.

39:41.545 --> 39:44.340
God, you're a genius.
So I've been told.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.510
Well, I guess you probably
want to write that scene down

39:47.551 --> 39:48.803
while it's still fresh.

39:50.012 --> 39:52.390
No. I can finish in the morning.

39:52.431 --> 39:54.183
'Cause right now,

39:54.225 --> 39:58.062
we have more
important work to do.

40:01.565 --> 40:03.317
Thank God I caught you.

40:03.359 --> 40:04.819
Whatever brilliant new evidence
you have about Charlie,

40:04.860 --> 40:06.278
I don't want to hear it.
I don't have any.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.739
I shouldn't have meddled.
It was...

40:08.781 --> 40:10.574
It was wrong. I'm sorry.

40:10.616 --> 40:13.369
Oh. Well, thanks.

40:13.411 --> 40:16.372
I was thinking
about why I did it.

40:16.414 --> 40:20.251
And I told myself that it was
because I didn't trust Charlie,

40:20.292 --> 40:22.086
and I was protecting a friend,

40:22.128 --> 40:23.796
but, um,

40:23.838 --> 40:27.049
uh, I'm just not sure
that that's completely true.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.175
Then why did you do it?

40:29.468 --> 40:31.554
That is the question,
isn't it? Um...

40:33.472 --> 40:35.349
You and I have gotten
to know each other

40:35.391 --> 40:37.393
quite well
recently, and...

40:38.894 --> 40:40.604
...I think
that you're fantastic.

40:42.481 --> 40:45.151
So I guess I was
somewhat, um, jealous.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.570
(laughs softly)
Jealous?

40:47.611 --> 40:48.779
Amanda,

40:48.821 --> 40:50.406
you're a
successful lawyer

40:50.448 --> 40:52.783
and a genius and a good friend.

40:52.825 --> 40:54.034
I'm just a dumb model.

40:54.076 --> 40:55.870
What do you have
to be jealous of?

40:55.911 --> 40:57.830
It's not what, it's who.
I-I'm not jealous of you, Kirby,

40:57.872 --> 40:59.582
I'm jealous of Charlie.

41:01.333 --> 41:03.377
Because she gets to be with you.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.005
Oh.

41:06.046 --> 41:08.841
I like you, Kirby.

41:08.883 --> 41:10.843
I think that I have
for a while now.

41:10.885 --> 41:13.679
But I do not want
to mess up anything

41:13.721 --> 41:18.392
that you have with Charlie,
because I want you to be happy.

41:18.434 --> 41:20.519
But you are not a dumb model.

41:20.561 --> 41:23.397
Okay? You're funny
and you are kind

41:23.439 --> 41:28.027
and you are clever, and, well,
you're pretty nice to look at.

41:28.068 --> 41:30.905
And every time I'm with you,
I just, I-I feel like...

41:30.946 --> 41:34.617
♪ We're strong enough
to let it go... ♪

41:35.576 --> 41:37.620
I have to go.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.705
♪ Oh, oh ♪

41:39.747 --> 41:44.418
♪ We're strong enough
