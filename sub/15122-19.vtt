WEBVTT

00:03.937 --> 00:08.142
Hola. You want to
join my fight club?

00:08.209 --> 00:10.111
We'll meet in the storage room
after hours

00:10.178 --> 00:12.913
and have it out man style.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.815
Isn't the first rule
of fight club,

00:14.882 --> 00:16.217
"Don't talk about fight club?"

00:16.284 --> 00:18.786
Yeah, I tried that approach.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.566
Apparently,
it's nearly impossible

00:32.633 --> 00:36.270
to start a fight club without
talking about fight club.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.506
Yeah, they do kind of
gloss over that in the movie.

00:38.572 --> 00:39.340
(door opens)

00:39.407 --> 00:40.508
SABRINA (whispers):
Look.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.343
Jimmy, your girlfriend's here.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.977
We went out a
couple of times.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.146
I wouldn't really
call her my...

00:45.213 --> 00:47.581
Jimmy! Ooh!

00:49.850 --> 00:50.951
Can't stay long.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.453
Here's the info
for the art class.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.222
And come early,
or you're gonna get stuck

00:54.288 --> 00:56.157
drawing by the lady
with the weird body noises.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.958
We call her Georgia O'Queefe.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.193
Yeah. Yeah, you'd have to.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.761
FRANK:
Seems like quite

01:00.828 --> 01:01.962
a firecracker.

01:02.029 --> 01:03.831
You sure you can handle
all that bang?

01:03.897 --> 01:06.534
Yes, I'm sure I can
handle her just fine.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.669
Let's talk about something
else, please. Please...
Come on.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.071
Oh, what? You can't
talk to me about girls?

01:11.139 --> 01:13.274
It's weird to talk
to a girl about girls.

01:13.341 --> 01:15.409
Why is it weird?
We're friends, right?

01:15.476 --> 01:17.711
I should be able to
talk to you about Wyatt,

01:17.778 --> 01:19.780
and you should be
able to talk to me

01:19.847 --> 01:21.182
about whoever it
is you're dating.

01:21.249 --> 01:22.450
No. You're right.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.752
I guess I can do it.
I guess.
Well, good.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.487
So, I got Wyatt
this body-shaving kit

01:26.554 --> 01:27.821
for his
birthday, and...

01:27.888 --> 01:30.090
Done. We're done. All done.

01:36.564 --> 01:41.635
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
Daddy-o, oh, oh, oh *

01:41.702 --> 01:45.206
* Birth control, no, no, no *

01:45.273 --> 01:48.642
* Let it roll, oh, oh, oh *

01:48.709 --> 01:52.112
* Oh *

01:52.180 --> 01:54.782
* Oh... *

01:54.848 --> 01:59.887
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

02:02.190 --> 02:04.858
Having rich
friends is awesome.

02:04.925 --> 02:05.826
It's like getting to take

02:05.893 --> 02:07.261
whatever you want
from the pawn shop.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.896
You guys really letting go

02:08.962 --> 02:10.831
of this long, skinny
sunset painting?
My snowboard?

02:10.898 --> 02:12.900
That's why
it curls up at the end.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.602
Still makes a nice painting.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.237
(Hope crying)

02:16.304 --> 02:17.671
Oh!
Ugh!

02:17.738 --> 02:20.073
I'll go lie down with her
till she falls asleep.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.611
This baby's killing us.
Jimmy's working and dating,

02:23.677 --> 02:26.113
so she's in our bed every night.
She's invading my dreams.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.315
You know how hard it is

02:27.381 --> 02:28.582
to mow Eddie Van Halen's lawn

02:28.649 --> 02:29.917
while dealing
with a crying baby?

02:29.983 --> 02:32.052
You know, we had the
same problem with Justin.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.987
We always let him come
into our bed

02:34.054 --> 02:36.824
when he was scared, all the
way to junior high school.

02:36.890 --> 02:39.660
The only good part was,
I was never late for work again.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.595
Nothing motivates you
to get out of bed

02:41.662 --> 02:43.331
like seeing your 12-year-old
son's morning wood.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.932
You know, we didn't want
the same thing

02:44.998 --> 02:47.601
to happen with our grandson,
so we just let him cry it out.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.936
BURT:
Wait, wait, wait.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.271
You just let the baby cry?

02:50.338 --> 02:52.440
It teaches them how
to self-soothe

02:52.506 --> 02:54.275
and handle their own fears.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.609
Hell, Chinese moms

02:55.676 --> 02:57.110
don't even give
the kid a pillow.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.247
Yeah, they just
throw a violin

02:59.313 --> 03:01.048
and a laptop
in the crib and say,

03:01.114 --> 03:02.149
"Learn it by morning,
donkey."

03:02.216 --> 03:03.484
I mean, that's why
the Chinese

03:03.551 --> 03:04.685
are beating us
at everything.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.820
You know, and now the Mexicans
are outworking us all.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.490
I'm telling you, the future is
a big old mess is what it is.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.658
It's a big old mess.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.493
It'll work out.
I don't know.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.629
It'll be okay.
It'll be okay.

03:18.966 --> 03:22.770
I can't believe Sylvia was
giving away these nails.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.538
I feel so glamorous.

03:24.605 --> 03:27.140
Like a senator's mistress.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.676
Don't they make
doing stuff hard?

03:28.742 --> 03:31.245
Well, I'm not gonna wear 'em
while I'm working.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.381
But they work fine at home.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.117
Guys, listen up.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.352
I just bought this book

03:38.419 --> 03:40.020
that Donovan
and Sylvia told me about.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.355
You guys have to read it.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.656
It's gonna blow
everybody's mind.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.461
It's blowing everybody's mind
that you bought a book.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.565
So I'm supposed
to just ignore my baby

03:51.632 --> 03:53.467
while she cries
in the crib?

03:53.534 --> 03:56.570
Yeah. Look, it's
written by a doctor.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.238
A doctor who
wrote a book.

03:58.306 --> 04:00.774
You are not going
to scar this baby

04:00.841 --> 04:02.643
by letting her cry
and feel abandoned.

04:02.710 --> 04:06.079
That's how Charlie Manson
got started-- not that I know,

04:06.146 --> 04:07.781
but one would assume.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.817
But do we want to mess her up
the way we messed up Jimmy?

04:09.883 --> 04:11.151
I'm not messed up.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.520
You're not not messed up.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.921
You crawled
into our bed

04:13.987 --> 04:15.723
once a week until
you were old enough to drive.

04:15.789 --> 04:16.957
I had night terrors.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.493
Oh, yeah, the Doghead Man.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.362
Damn it, Mom!
When he hears his name,

04:21.429 --> 04:22.963
that's when he comes after you.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.465
Not that he exists.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.734
If we'd have made him
more independent as a baby,

04:26.800 --> 04:29.169
he might not be so
scared of Doghead Man.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.471
Where did Doghead Man
come from?

04:30.538 --> 04:31.939
Please, just stop saying it.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.041
I don't know.
It just kind of started one day.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.444
(dramatic theme plays on TV)

04:38.446 --> 04:40.614
(screaming)

04:41.982 --> 04:45.686
That crazy Doghead Man
lives in my closet,

04:45.753 --> 04:48.422
and eats little boys
who go through my stuff.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.991
He also eats tattletales,

04:51.058 --> 04:52.826
so keep your trap shut!

04:54.462 --> 04:55.763
(screaming)

04:55.829 --> 04:57.431
We never sleep-trained him
as a baby,

04:57.498 --> 04:59.132
so he never faced
any fears alone.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.568
That's why he's never slept

05:00.634 --> 05:02.269
more than four feet from us
his entire life.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.804
Oh, I've been on sleepovers.

05:03.871 --> 05:04.805
You've been on,

05:04.872 --> 05:06.407
hang out till 10:00,
start crying,

05:06.474 --> 05:08.041
then make us come
pick you up overs.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.410
We made him a wuss.

05:09.477 --> 05:10.678
Every time he got
in trouble, he knew

05:10.744 --> 05:12.380
Mommy and Daddy were just
a holler away.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.314
(grunts)

05:14.382 --> 05:16.083
Help!

05:17.184 --> 05:19.787
Help!

05:20.888 --> 05:22.055
Help!

05:22.122 --> 05:24.658
Are you aware
that you're going to hell, sir?

05:24.725 --> 05:26.627
Help!

05:26.694 --> 05:29.597
Wow. I don't want Hope
to be helpless like that.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.999
But I could never listen
to her cry for hours.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.066
Course you couldn't.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.168
'Cause we made you a wuss!

05:35.235 --> 05:36.470
You guys, keep it down.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.171
I'm calling
the department store.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.107
I can't hear!

05:40.173 --> 05:41.875
I bet you Jeffrey Dahmer
was left in the crib.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.343
And the BLT Killer.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.946
And Tyra Banks.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.214
Uh-uh. We're doing it.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.016
Hope is my kid.
I'm the dad.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.951
I'm the one
that makes the tough decisions.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.720
Yeah.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.187
But you'll do
the training, right?

05:54.254 --> 05:57.558
It'll kill me to hear her
cry that much.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.327
What? You're the ones
who made me a wuss.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.796
Is this Montgomery Ward?

06:02.863 --> 06:05.399
Oh, I'd like
to order a pepper mill.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.601
I can't find mine.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.509
Grab an easel.
I'll be back in a minute.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.345
Cool. I will, uh,
save you a spot.

06:18.412 --> 06:21.081
Hey, Jimmy.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.783
Rosa. Hey.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.051
I didn't know you were into art.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.152
Eh. It's okay.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.620
You mind if I work
next to you?

06:26.687 --> 06:27.988
That one over there

06:28.055 --> 06:30.824
makes lady noises when
she leans over to draw.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.860
Yeah, I heard
about her.
Mm-hmm.

06:32.926 --> 06:36.063
Uh, but I'm saving
this spot for the
girl I came in with.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.265
We're on a date,
so I am sorry.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.500
Oh. (laughs)

06:39.567 --> 06:41.068
That's so sweet.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.871
You know, Carlos and I
used to make jewelry together,

06:43.937 --> 06:46.540
but now he just does
his stupid video games,

06:46.607 --> 06:50.243
so I take these classes
and cheat on him in my mind.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.846
Good evening, Clifford.

06:54.448 --> 06:57.651
Well, uh, I'm just glad
that my date's into art,

06:57.718 --> 06:59.687
'cause I think
it's really cool

06:59.753 --> 07:01.154
that we have
something in common.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.629
(laughs quietly)

07:08.696 --> 07:12.600
Jimmy, you look
so freaked out,

07:12.666 --> 07:16.169
like a deer caught
in his girlfriend's high beams.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.438
Not freaked out.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.040
I always figured the first time
I saw her naked

07:20.107 --> 07:21.975
would be with a bunch
of strangers and my mom's boss.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.245
Hold on, folks.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.981
I forgot to stretch first.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.822
She was just waving her woo-hoo
around for everybody to see?

07:34.888 --> 07:36.957
She sounds like a whole
lot of woman, Jimmy.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.259
You may be in over your head,
like when you volunteered

07:39.326 --> 07:40.894
for Big Brothers, and that
ten-year-old kicked your ass.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.796
Hey, I got a couple
good shots in.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.464
No, you didn't.
It's not your fault.

07:44.532 --> 07:45.799
We made you a wuss.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.035
Fine. I'm not super macho,

07:48.101 --> 07:50.538
but why do people keep acting
like I'm some uptight choirboy?

07:50.604 --> 07:51.672
If you're not uptight,

07:51.739 --> 07:53.574
then why did you draw a bikini

07:53.641 --> 07:54.942
on your naked girlfriend?

07:56.544 --> 07:58.779
BURT:
Yeah. Thanks
for ruining the picture.

07:58.846 --> 08:02.215
Hey, I am not some lightweight
who's never raised hell.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.751
I dated a serial killer.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.352
I can date this girl.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.187
In fact, we're going out
tonight.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.889
BURT:
You only dated
a serial killer

08:08.956 --> 08:10.257
for one night, and she
would have killed you

08:10.323 --> 08:11.859
if we hadn't knocked her out
with the TV.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.662
We?! I knocked out
the serial killer.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.197
Why must you refuse
to share that glory?

08:17.264 --> 08:18.599
Burt, I'm a maid.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.268
I have no surplus glory
I can share.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.006
Sabrina, I need
an odd little favor.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.441
Would-Would you be willing
to punch me in the face?

08:28.508 --> 08:29.610
You can stay clocked in.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.078
Excuse me?

08:31.144 --> 08:32.312
Well, I'm planning

08:32.379 --> 08:33.346
on joining Frank's fight club.

08:33.413 --> 08:34.815
Membership doubled.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.650
But here's the thing.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.985
I've never been hit.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.120
I was hoping to start
with somebody petite?

08:40.187 --> 08:42.690
Barney, please don't do
fight club.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.158
You will lose so bad.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.927
It's not about winning
or losing.

08:46.994 --> 08:50.263
It's about for once not worrying
about things like store profits,

08:50.330 --> 08:53.266
or how much to bid on vintage,
crocheted doll sweaters online.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.804
I want to feel primal
and real and alive.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.772
When you taste blood
in your mouth,

08:58.839 --> 09:00.307
you're tasting your manhood.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.676
I'd hate to keep you
from tasting manhood.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.311
Barney, I'm-I'm not
gonna punch you.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.514
I like you too much.
It's weird. Uh...

09:07.581 --> 09:09.216
Great.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.251
Then I'm just gonna have
to bite my own lip.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.120
I'll bite your lip.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.889
(Hope crying)

09:15.956 --> 09:19.426
Screaming, screaming, screaming,
screaming, screaming.

09:19.492 --> 09:22.596
"Find a distraction."

09:22.663 --> 09:24.397
(crying continues)

09:24.464 --> 09:26.566
Find a...

09:34.341 --> 09:36.309
Damn. Nothing?

09:36.376 --> 09:39.079
I'm not supposed to press
too hard with the eraser.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.247
(crying continues)

09:40.313 --> 09:41.749
(sighs, groans)

09:43.617 --> 09:45.252
I can't take it, Virginia!

09:45.318 --> 09:47.354
I...

09:51.058 --> 09:53.694
I can't take it, Virginia!

09:53.761 --> 09:55.028
You started
this whole thing.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.497
You need to finish it.
Now, get back in there!

09:57.564 --> 10:01.401
NORMAN:
Hey, I'm calling the cops
if you guys don't shut up!

10:01.468 --> 10:03.436
You shut up, Norman!

10:03.503 --> 10:05.706
We had to put up
with your crying

10:05.773 --> 10:07.708
after your wife
finally left you!

10:08.709 --> 10:11.178
(yelling in frustration)

10:11.244 --> 10:13.781
(lively, indistinct
conversation)

10:19.753 --> 10:22.890
Wow. This is the craziest
restaurant I've ever seen.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.092
Oh, it's not officially
a restaurant.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.194
It's my friend
Alejandro's house.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.329
Oh. Then I guess
the Hard Rock Café

10:29.396 --> 10:31.464
is still the craziest
restaurant I've ever seen.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.133
Alejandro's under house arrest.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.069
He's a great chef,
but a terrible counterfeiter.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.171
Ah.
Oh, hey,
that's me

10:38.238 --> 10:39.907
and DJ Mr. Sing.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.742
Pretty cool, huh?

10:41.809 --> 10:44.444
Yeah, he seems like
a friendly fella.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.714
Hey! Zoey!

10:46.780 --> 10:49.016
(laughter)

10:49.082 --> 10:50.818
And Zoey's man-boy.

10:52.753 --> 10:53.954
Alejandro, this is Jimmy.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.255
He's very handsome.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.456
Does he have a name?

10:56.523 --> 10:59.192
Jimmy. She sorta
just said that.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.260
Oh, my God.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.095
I love this jacket.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.864
I have to have
this jacket.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.465
I'll give you $100
for this jacket.

11:05.532 --> 11:10.170
This has a picture
of a monkey on it.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.139
(Hope crying)

11:15.408 --> 11:17.410
(crying stops)

11:17.477 --> 11:20.047
(crickets chirping outside)

11:20.113 --> 11:22.149
We did it.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.290
Oh...

11:30.357 --> 11:31.624
This is your fault.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.793
You're the one
who came back there,

11:32.860 --> 11:34.694
telling me about
all the misery she was in.

11:34.762 --> 11:37.064
Put the baby down.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.834
Hey.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.202
Meet Kevin.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.904
We'll be eating him tonight.

11:43.971 --> 11:47.240
Accompanied by some
very special Incan tea.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.877
That's what the Incans drink
to worship their sun god.

11:49.943 --> 11:53.113
Oh, yeah. I'm more
of a God-God worshipper.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.783
(laughs)
Don't be afraid
to try the tea.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.417
Whoa. Okay. I'm not afraid.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.052
I can hang with the tea.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.021
You know, on a dare once,
I snorted an entire packet

12:01.088 --> 12:02.923
of pop rocks. Yeah.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.291
(Hope crying)
I couldn't take it,

12:04.357 --> 12:06.193
knowing she was in
there, screaming.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.527
But Hope was so close
to a breakthrough

12:07.594 --> 12:08.829
in emotional conditioning

12:08.896 --> 12:10.798
where she'd be comfortable
with self-soothing.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.100
Wow. You really did
read that book.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.734
Actually, that was
just on the back cover.

12:14.802 --> 12:15.869
(crying stops)

12:15.936 --> 12:18.939
(crickets chirping outside)

12:21.508 --> 12:22.709
(both sigh, groan)

12:22.776 --> 12:25.478
Can one of you help me take
the batteries out of this doll?

12:25.545 --> 12:27.915
You have to take Maw Maw and go.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.850
Wait, I think I found out
where they are.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.118
Give me the girl.

12:35.588 --> 12:39.392
Kevin was delicious. Wow.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.693
Thank you.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.962
It's the tea.

12:42.029 --> 12:45.365
It makes everything delicious.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.634
I was going to make you a
homemade butterscotch pudding

12:47.700 --> 12:49.469
for dessert,

12:49.536 --> 12:51.171
but I'm out of butter
and I drank all the scotch.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.272
(laughing)

12:55.608 --> 12:57.444
We can get that stuff
from Jimmy's store.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.113
No, but the store closed,
like, an hour ago.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.581
Don't you have a key?

13:01.648 --> 13:03.083
Yeah.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.552
So we'll go there
and get the ingredients.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.555
We'll leave money,
so it won't even be stealing.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.925
Okay.

13:11.992 --> 13:15.062
Wow, you guys are making
a lot of sense right now.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.496
But we should walk.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.730
I'm pretty sure even
the Incans couldn't drive

13:17.797 --> 13:18.798
after drinking this tea.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.500
(laughing)

13:21.701 --> 13:23.370
(laughing)

13:23.436 --> 13:25.672
(all laughing)

13:25.738 --> 13:27.507
(cackling)

13:31.879 --> 13:33.981
(Jimmy laughing)

13:39.019 --> 13:41.221
(rock music plays on radio)

13:41.288 --> 13:44.057
How lucid are
you right now?

13:44.124 --> 13:46.793
Oh, I'd give it
a good seven or eight.

13:46.860 --> 13:50.330
Why?

13:50.397 --> 13:53.166
What do you think about
letting a little baby

13:53.233 --> 13:54.467
cry herself to sleep?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.336
Wilfred was a fan.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.839
He tried to sleep-train
Virginia when she was a baby.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.641
I'm Virginia.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.911
Okay, I'm a six.

14:03.977 --> 14:07.547
Anyway, Wilfred tried
to sleep-train...

14:08.748 --> 14:11.618
...somebody.
But I never helped.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.320
So he'd always give up.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.487
He gave up?

14:14.554 --> 14:16.056
Which stinks.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.858
(whispers):
The girl is still
living with me.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.230
She's very... clingy.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.797
I hate it.

14:24.864 --> 14:25.966
I hope it's not you.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.774
Where are we going?

14:34.841 --> 14:37.310
To help my husband be strong.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.254
Does it feel like you
have a tail, too?

14:47.320 --> 14:48.588
'Cause I feel
like I have a tail.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.822
You might want to make sure

14:49.889 --> 14:50.890
you're not pooping.

14:50.958 --> 14:51.992
The tea can do that.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.427
No. I think I'm cool.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.231
Whoa. I can see in the dark.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.566
Do you have
night vision, too?

14:59.632 --> 15:02.069
That was just Mr. Sing
turning on the lights.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.337
Store closed.
Free stuff!

15:08.976 --> 15:11.678
Oh, my God.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.645
What's wrong?

15:12.712 --> 15:16.149
Is there a giant
snake around my neck?

15:16.216 --> 15:18.618
(laughing)
Oh, man.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.454
You are totally
in tea phase.

15:21.521 --> 15:24.924
The first time
is always the best.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.695
Yeah... this is awesome.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.599
(sobbing)

15:32.665 --> 15:35.035
What happened?

15:35.102 --> 15:37.004
You okay?

15:37.070 --> 15:38.438
She did it.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.340
She's asleep.

15:40.407 --> 15:41.975
I'm so, so proud
of that little trouper.

15:42.042 --> 15:46.113
And it felt great to trust
that she'd have the strength

15:46.179 --> 15:48.181
to pull it off and
then have her step up and do it.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.317
Oh, this is just
the beginning.

15:50.383 --> 15:53.120
I'm gonna read more book covers.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.421
You should have
made me stay

15:54.487 --> 15:56.789
and be strong,
so I could feel this, too.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.491
I could be sharing
in this glory.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.161
You got the serial killer
with the TV, remember?

16:01.228 --> 16:03.663
It's my turn to shine.

16:08.235 --> 16:10.170
Have you seen Mr. Sing?
(Hope crying)

16:10.237 --> 16:11.471
We're playing tag.

16:11.538 --> 16:12.805
Shh!

16:12.872 --> 16:14.974
I just heard Hope crying.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.676
She's in the store somewhere.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.645
Free stuff!

16:18.711 --> 16:19.779
There he is.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.148
(Hope crying)

16:24.651 --> 16:26.653
It's okay, honey.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.155
Daddy's right here.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.658
Oh, that's it.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.626
MAN'S VOICE:
Daddy, you're hallucinating.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.729
I think it's time you called
your Mommy. Love you.

16:44.637 --> 16:45.738
(phone ringing)

16:45.805 --> 16:47.707
Hello?

16:47.774 --> 16:50.810
Mom? I drank this Inca tea,

16:50.877 --> 16:54.147
and now I'm seeing
all these crazy things.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.183
Oh, boy. Where are you?

16:56.249 --> 16:57.817
The grocery store.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.487
Okay. Stay calm.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.995
Mom?

17:09.062 --> 17:10.797
Did you put a store in our yard?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.299
Hey. What's going on?

17:12.365 --> 17:15.235
Jimmy said he drank
some kind of weird tea,

17:15.302 --> 17:16.869
and now he's
tripping his nads off.

17:16.936 --> 17:18.938
JIMMY:
Answer me. Did you...

17:19.005 --> 17:20.773
Hey, buddy.
Just drink some water.

17:20.840 --> 17:23.009
Your daughter toughed it out
tonight, and so can you.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.845
No, just check the back door,
and tell me if you see me.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.348
Deal with your crisis, son.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.451
Why did you
hang up on him?

17:31.518 --> 17:33.553
Because he has to finally
face some fears on his own.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.324
Whoa.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.901
ZOEY'S VOICE:
Jimmy, everything all right?

17:48.968 --> 17:50.670
(Hope crying)

17:50.737 --> 17:53.373
You okay?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.842
Oh... I just want
to go home and see my mommy.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.077
Did you just say
your "mommy"?

17:58.145 --> 17:59.746
No! Shut up!

17:59.812 --> 18:02.081
All right, look, I just
want this night to be over.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.050
BARNEY:
James?

18:04.117 --> 18:07.687
You guys here
for Fight Club?

18:07.754 --> 18:09.422
Cool.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.825
Inca tea, man.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.961
Drank plenty of that
when I worked in Chile.

18:15.027 --> 18:17.029
One time it made me think
I was a great white shark

18:17.096 --> 18:19.332
for an entire day--
bit four people.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.734
I just want
to be home in my bed.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.035
You'll be there in
a few minutes.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.537
Everything's okay now.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.605
(shrieks)

18:25.672 --> 18:27.207
Crazy Doghead Man!

18:27.274 --> 18:28.541
(screams)

18:28.608 --> 18:31.378
(yelps)

18:32.745 --> 18:34.214
Come on, James.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.982
It's the tea talking.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.350
Great white shark, remember?

18:42.189 --> 18:44.891
James, get in the car.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.926
No! Get away!

18:46.993 --> 18:48.127
(yelps)

18:50.697 --> 18:53.200
Help!

18:56.536 --> 18:58.605
(screams)
Let me in!

19:01.308 --> 19:04.744
The crazy Doghead Man
is after me!

19:04.811 --> 19:05.845
Please!

19:05.912 --> 19:07.614
He's freaking out.
We got to let him in.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.881
Stay strong.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.117
This is your chance
to do what I did with Hope.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.686
(sobbing):
Please let me in!

19:13.753 --> 19:16.122
He'll be fine.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.525
And just think how proud
you're gonna be of yourself.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.093
You're right.
It's just so hard.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.231
Hang in there!
Self-soothe!

19:24.297 --> 19:25.632
You're so close

19:25.698 --> 19:27.500
to your emotional
conditioning breakthrough!

19:27.567 --> 19:28.635
Dad!

19:28.701 --> 19:30.237
Mom!

19:31.838 --> 19:33.840
(sobbing):
Please!

19:33.906 --> 19:36.175
Deal with your crisis!

19:36.243 --> 19:39.246
I love you!

19:40.980 --> 19:43.416
James. Calm down.

19:43.483 --> 19:46.753
Go away, Doghead Man.

19:46.819 --> 19:50.523
And never come back.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.297
Finally.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.232
The taste of blood.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.967
Thank you, James.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.636
I feel so alive!

20:14.381 --> 20:16.649
Morning, baby.
You did it.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.620
You faced your demons and got
through the night by yourself.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.722
Yeah, you're still
only 35 feet from our bed,

20:22.789 --> 20:24.156
but that's more
than four feet.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.959
Yeah. It's a start.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.095
I'm glad you took
care of yourself.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.363
And now that you're up,

20:30.430 --> 20:32.532
Hope's got a few demons
in her diaper

20:32.599 --> 20:33.833
you might want to face.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.016
Ooh.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.687
Still recovering, huh?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.289
Yeah.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.458
So, Zoey...

20:58.525 --> 21:00.993
Yeah. That's kind of done.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.929
Not that she was too
wild for me to handle.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.732
It's just that once
I got to know her,

21:05.798 --> 21:09.168
she's just too much of
a crazy, inconsiderate,

21:09.235 --> 21:11.003
possibly drug-addicted tramp.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.071
But great girl.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.606
Whew.

21:17.143 --> 21:19.111
Before all this tea wears off,

21:19.178 --> 21:21.581
you should watch Wizard of Oz
and play Dark Side of the Moon

21:21.648 --> 21:25.918
at the same time.
It will blow your mind.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.392
CHILD: That was funny.
