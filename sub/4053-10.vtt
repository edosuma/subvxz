<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

00:01.439 --> 00:02.876
You hung me out to dry.

00:02.976 --> 00:04.460
How exactly did I do that?

00:04.560 --> 00:05.842
By making it seem like
I'm the one

00:05.895 --> 00:07.194
that's taking away
your dream wedding.

00:07.229 --> 00:08.929
You are the one taking away
my dream wedding!

00:08.964 --> 00:09.930
We're getting married,

00:09.965 --> 00:12.065
and it can be as small
as possible

00:12.101 --> 00:13.600
with just our close friends,
okay?

00:13.636 --> 00:15.135
I think we should consider
promoting Jack Soloff

00:15.170 --> 00:16.837
to name partner.
Are you crazy?

00:16.872 --> 00:17.971
Hardman's got something
on him.

00:18.007 --> 00:19.373
If Hardman has something
on him,

00:19.408 --> 00:21.108
then we need to have it
on him, too.

00:21.143 --> 00:23.944
You want me gone,
call for a vote,

00:23.979 --> 00:26.179
'cause we know what's going on
with Daniel's investor,

00:26.215 --> 00:28.282
and Harvey's about to put a stop
to it right now.

00:28.317 --> 00:29.850
Why should I believe you
would even live up to

00:29.885 --> 00:31.051
your end of the bargain?

00:31.053 --> 00:32.552
Because I don't give a shit

00:32.588 --> 00:34.221
about your war with
Daniel Hardman.

00:34.256 --> 00:37.257
All I want to do is see you
get down on your knees

00:37.293 --> 00:39.793
and say, "I quit."

00:39.795 --> 00:41.395
You're breaking the law
every day.

00:41.430 --> 00:43.063
Oh, so now I shouldn't
get married?

00:43.065 --> 00:44.131
I'm saying you should quit.

00:44.166 --> 00:46.066
The longer you go,

00:46.101 --> 00:47.301
the less the money matters.

00:47.336 --> 00:48.602
You almost got caught,
didn't you?

00:48.637 --> 00:50.003
I went to talk to someone.

00:50.039 --> 00:51.271
Who?

00:51.307 --> 00:53.340
You know who.

00:54.343 --> 00:58.211
Mom?
Dad!

01:00.015 --> 01:01.698
Grammy, what are you
doing here?

01:01.734 --> 01:03.567
Where's mom?
I want to give her a hug.

01:03.619 --> 01:05.152
Dad, too.

01:05.187 --> 01:06.603
What?

01:06.655 --> 01:08.789
You told me not to be mad
at them last night, remember?

01:08.824 --> 01:10.390
You said once they got home
I should tell them I was sorry

01:10.392 --> 01:11.992
and give them a hug.

01:12.027 --> 01:14.995
But they didn't wake me up,
so I didn't get to,

01:15.030 --> 01:18.165
and I want to.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.200
Michael, I have to
tell you something.

01:20.235 --> 01:22.769
What is it?

01:22.805 --> 01:26.139
Your--your parents,

01:26.175 --> 01:31.228
last night they were in
a car accident.

01:31.263 --> 01:36.149
But they're gonna
be okay, right?

01:36.185 --> 01:40.153
Michael, they passed away.

01:40.189 --> 01:42.939
What?

01:42.992 --> 01:44.408
No.

01:44.443 --> 01:46.943
No, they can't be.

01:56.038 --> 01:57.371
I could have gone
to the hospital.

01:57.373 --> 01:59.373
I could have seen them!

01:59.425 --> 02:01.758
They didn't make it to
the hospital, sweetheart,

02:01.794 --> 02:05.429
and--and I didn't want to
tell you until I had to.

02:05.464 --> 02:07.214
How could you
do this to me?

Where did you just go?

06:18.759 --> 06:19.892
I'm sorry.

06:19.927 --> 06:21.643
I was just thinking about
the time I had to decide

06:21.695 --> 06:23.061
whether or not
I should tell my father

06:23.063 --> 06:24.296
that my mother was
cheating on him.

06:24.331 --> 06:25.864
And maybe we should
talk about that.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.266
I didn't come here
to talk about that.

06:27.268 --> 06:29.368
I came here to figure out
whether or not I should resign.

06:29.403 --> 06:31.336
And then you started
thinking about your mother.

06:31.372 --> 06:32.805
And if your brain went
to the one,

06:32.840 --> 06:34.640
then it's connecting it
to the other,

06:34.675 --> 06:36.074
and the best thing
we can do right now

06:36.110 --> 06:37.176
is to try and figure out why.

06:37.211 --> 06:38.277
I don't have time
for that.

06:38.312 --> 06:39.812
Harvey, you asked me
to block out the day

06:39.847 --> 06:42.347
for an emergency session,
and I did.

06:42.383 --> 06:44.416
We have time.

06:47.588 --> 06:49.471
The white ones are best.

06:49.507 --> 06:51.690
You're just here to
make me go in.

06:51.742 --> 06:54.026
I am.

06:54.061 --> 06:55.561
Because sometimes
we make choices

06:55.596 --> 06:57.262
we're not old enough to make,

06:57.298 --> 06:59.298
and then we regret them.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.266
I don't want that
to happen to you.

07:01.302 --> 07:03.468

not going into that place?

09:23.610 --> 09:27.779
Maybe the cool father,
but...not a great one.

09:27.815 --> 09:30.449
And now, I know it's too late
to make that up to you.

09:30.484 --> 09:33.352
I'm just hoping it's not too
late to make it up to Marcus.

09:33.387 --> 09:35.053
Anyway, that's my news.

09:35.089 --> 09:38.290
What--what did you want
to talk about?

09:38.342 --> 09:40.125
Nothing.
I met a girl.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.927
Great.
What's her name?

09:41.962 --> 09:44.096
Scottie.

09:44.131 --> 09:46.465
I'm just trying to figure out
the long distance thing.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.717
All I can tell you there is,
if she's the one,

09:48.752 --> 09:52.738
you'll know, just like with
me and your mother.

09:55.409 --> 09:56.675
So you didn't tell him?

09:56.710 --> 09:57.976
No, I didn't.

09:58.012 --> 10:00.562
But you said that was the
night you decided to tell him.

10:00.597 --> 10:01.947
That was the night
I decided.

10:01.982 --> 10:04.583
No, you said it as though
it was all one night.

10:04.618 --> 10:08.420
I told you it was
all one night

10:08.472 --> 10:11.790
because I'm so used to lying
whenever I tell this story.

10:11.825 --> 10:12.858
My age--

10:12.860 --> 10:14.092
Why do you lie?

10:14.128 --> 10:16.428
Because I was a grown man
when it happened,

10:16.463 --> 10:17.623
and grown men
keep their words

10:17.648 --> 10:19.231
when they say
they're gonna do something,

10:19.233 --> 10:20.532
not give in to weakness.

10:20.584 --> 10:23.535
But it wasn't weakness that
made you break your word.

10:23.570 --> 10:24.936
It was love for your father.

10:24.972 --> 10:27.205
Then aren't I an asshole?

10:27.241 --> 10:30.792
Because I ended up ruining
everything two weeks later.

10:32.796 --> 10:34.880
Louis, I need to
talk to you for a minute.

10:34.915 --> 10:35.847
About what?

10:35.849 --> 10:37.215
Jack Soloff is
calling for a vote

10:37.251 --> 10:40.969
to remove me as
managing partner today.

10:41.004 --> 10:42.220
What?

10:42.222 --> 10:43.455
Why the hell would he do that

10:43.490 --> 10:44.856
after you offered to make him
name partner?

10:44.908 --> 10:46.708
Because I didn't offer
to make him name partner.

10:46.744 --> 10:48.060
I told him to resign.

10:48.095 --> 10:49.061
What happened to our plan?

10:49.096 --> 10:50.362
It wasn't our plan, Louis.

10:50.364 --> 10:52.230
It was your insane idea,

10:52.266 --> 10:53.398
and I was never
going to do it.

10:53.434 --> 10:54.366
Jessica--

10:54.401 --> 10:56.301
No, you listen to me.

10:56.336 --> 10:57.936
The matter at hand is

10:57.971 --> 11:00.005
making sure that we have
more people on our side

11:00.007 --> 11:01.773
than he and Daniel have
on theirs.

11:01.809 --> 11:03.141
What am I
supposed to do now?

11:03.177 --> 11:04.843
<i>You are going to do exactly</i>
<i>what I told you to do</i>

11:04.878 --> 11:05.994
<i>in the first place.</i>

11:06.046 --> 11:07.546
You're gonna find out
what Daniel has

11:07.581 --> 11:11.216
on that weaselly son of a bitch,
and do it before 7:00 tonight.

11:11.251 --> 11:13.585
Because if I can't get
enough votes before then,

11:13.637 --> 11:16.755
the only way we win is to make
this whole thing go away.

11:16.757 --> 11:19.007
<i><font color="#D900D9">[dramatic music]</font></i>

11:19.059 --> 11:20.425
Cancel my day.

11:28.044 --> 11:29.711
We have to talk.

11:29.764 --> 11:31.029
I'm studying, Grammy.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.681
I don't care what you say
you're doing.

11:32.716 --> 11:34.383
What I say I'm doing?

11:34.418 --> 11:36.301
Father Walker called me.

11:36.353 --> 11:37.453
He said you've been
acting out.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.854
Father Walker's a priest.

11:38.889 --> 11:40.322
He thinks you're acting out
if you're chewing gum.

11:40.357 --> 11:41.657
Well, I agree with him.

11:41.692 --> 11:43.659
Yeah, and you're not at school
and all I do is get As.

11:43.694 --> 11:45.227
I don't care
what you're getting.

11:45.262 --> 11:46.295
I found these in the trash.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.629
So what.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.864
So what?

11:48.899 --> 11:50.866
"The Little Prince,"
"James and the Giant Peach,"

11:50.901 --> 11:52.468
Michael, you love these books.

11:52.503 --> 11:53.702
Yeah, when I was a kid.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.137
Those books were your
connection to your mother

11:55.172 --> 11:56.638
and father.

11:56.674 --> 12:00.542
Yeah, well,
I don't want them anymore.

12:00.544 --> 12:01.977
You don't want
this one either?

12:01.979 --> 12:04.580
Your mother and I
didn't always get along,

12:04.615 --> 12:07.499
but I know that she read this
to you every night

12:07.551 --> 12:09.685
when you were little
because she told me.

12:09.687 --> 12:13.355
And I also know that you'd
never let me read it to you

12:13.390 --> 12:16.058
because you said
it was so special.

12:16.093 --> 12:17.626
Like I said,
I'm not a kid anymore.

12:17.661 --> 12:18.961
Michael,
I'm worried about you.

12:18.996 --> 12:20.496
Father Walker is worried.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.097
I don't care what
Father Walker thinks,

12:22.132 --> 12:25.400
and I don't care about
these stupid books.

12:25.436 --> 12:27.703
Well, I do care,

12:27.738 --> 12:29.938
and I think you'd better go talk
to Father Walker tomorrow

12:29.990 --> 12:32.474
because you're not
getting all As.

12:32.510 --> 12:36.545
He's giving you an F
on your history paper.

12:39.617 --> 12:41.717
Louis, what are you
doing here?

12:41.752 --> 12:43.151
How did you get past Stacy?

12:43.187 --> 12:44.353
I walked right by her.

12:44.388 --> 12:46.221
Well, in that case,
what can I do for you?

12:46.257 --> 12:48.690
I want to know what the hell
you have on Jack Soloff.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.959
I have nothing on Jack
other than his trust

12:50.995 --> 12:53.579
and confidence that I'm
a better attorney than Jessica.

12:53.631 --> 12:54.563
Shut your mouth.

12:54.598 --> 12:55.864
You're not fit to
lick her boots.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.433
Good, because that's
your job, Louis, not mine.

12:58.469 --> 13:00.602
Listen to me.

13:00.638 --> 13:01.970
Remember when I told you
I'd kill you

13:02.006 --> 13:04.423
if you so much as tell me
the incorrect time?

13:04.475 --> 13:05.674
Tell me what you have
on Jack right now

13:05.726 --> 13:06.942
or you're dead
in 15 seconds.

13:06.977 --> 13:08.610
I remember when
you did that, Louis.

13:08.646 --> 13:11.346
And right after that,
I went straight to my attorneys

13:11.382 --> 13:14.616
and told them
you had threatened my life.

13:14.652 --> 13:17.519
And now, you've come into
my office and done it again

13:17.555 --> 13:18.487
in front of a witness.

13:18.522 --> 13:20.055
What witness?

13:20.090 --> 13:21.657
Stacy, did you get that?

13:21.692 --> 13:23.258
<i>I got it.</i>

13:23.310 --> 13:24.526
So as I see it,

13:24.562 --> 13:27.429
security will be here
in about 60 seconds.

13:27.464 --> 13:29.948
So if you want to kill me,

13:29.984 --> 13:31.583
now is your chance.

13:31.635 --> 13:32.935
I swear to God,
I will find out

13:32.970 --> 13:34.202
what you're holding
over Jack's head.

13:34.238 --> 13:35.537
I doubt that,

13:35.573 --> 13:37.573
and I certainly doubt that
you'll find it by 7:00.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.558
So instead of me telling you
what I have on Jack,

13:39.593 --> 13:40.909
let me tell you
what I have on you.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.377
You vote with me today

13:42.413 --> 13:44.680
and your sister's company
lives.

13:44.715 --> 13:45.948
- What?
- Oh, it turns out

13:45.983 --> 13:48.350
my client is looking to get into
the muffin business.

13:48.385 --> 13:49.952
You leave my sister
out of this.

13:49.987 --> 13:51.486
Sure thing.

13:51.522 --> 13:53.388
As long as you vote
to remove Jessica.

13:53.424 --> 13:55.090
I can't do that.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.459
Then I'm not only
gonna buy it,

13:57.494 --> 14:00.262
I'm gonna rip that company
of hers apart.

14:00.314 --> 14:01.897
You son of a bitch!
She never did anything to you.

14:01.932 --> 14:03.632
No.

14:03.667 --> 14:04.600
But you did.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.368
And Jessica did.

14:06.403 --> 14:08.637
And Harvey did.

14:08.672 --> 14:11.073
So you have a choice,

14:11.108 --> 14:14.309
your firm or your family.

14:23.721 --> 14:25.687
Michael?

14:25.739 --> 14:27.656
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

14:27.691 --> 14:29.591
People have been calling me
that a lot lately.

14:29.627 --> 14:33.061
Maybe it's a sign.

14:33.097 --> 14:34.696
How can I help you?

14:34.732 --> 14:36.848
I need to talk to someone.

14:36.900 --> 14:40.118
I was hoping to do it
under the confessional.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.004
How long has it been
since your last confession?

14:42.039 --> 14:43.839
Aren't you supposed to
ask me that after we started?

14:43.874 --> 14:44.840
We have started.

14:44.875 --> 14:47.492
Have a seat.

14:47.544 --> 14:48.710
Here?

14:48.746 --> 14:49.845
Why not?

14:49.880 --> 14:51.680
Confession's meant to be
good for the soul

14:51.715 --> 14:53.382
and no one's ever said anything
about it having to be done

14:53.417 --> 14:56.051
in a little dark box.

14:56.086 --> 14:58.387
Please.

14:59.890 --> 15:01.657
You gave that paper
an F?

15:01.692 --> 15:03.058
It deserves an A.

15:03.093 --> 15:05.127
What about the fact that
you cut the entire afternoon

15:05.162 --> 15:06.728
last Tuesday?
I had a doctor's appointment.

15:06.764 --> 15:08.063
You even had a note
from your grandmother.

15:08.098 --> 15:09.297
That's right, I did.

15:09.299 --> 15:10.465
The problem is, Michael,

15:10.501 --> 15:12.334
your grandmother wrote me
a note yesterday

15:12.369 --> 15:14.469
thanking me for letting
her book club use the library.

15:14.505 --> 15:17.139
And those two signatures,

15:17.174 --> 15:20.042
they don't look the same
at all.

15:22.279 --> 15:23.412
Okay, well, if you're
so sure I did this,

15:23.447 --> 15:24.847
then why are you
only giving me an F

15:24.898 --> 15:26.581
and not suspending me?

15:26.617 --> 15:28.250
Because I don't think
it's a coincidence that

15:28.285 --> 15:30.919
you chose to cut class on
parent-teacher conference day.

15:30.954 --> 15:33.088
That had nothing
to do with it.

15:33.123 --> 15:35.357
Mike, your grandmother told me
about the books you threw out.

15:35.409 --> 15:37.042
Every parent in the world
is obsessed

15:37.094 --> 15:38.210
with their kid
cleaning their room.

15:38.262 --> 15:39.344
I actually do it,

15:39.396 --> 15:41.129
and the two of you make
a federal case out of it.

15:41.165 --> 15:42.631
You didn't throw out
those books to clean.

15:42.666 --> 15:44.683
You did it because you saw
those kids out there

15:44.735 --> 15:46.301
with their parents

15:46.336 --> 15:48.403
and you just couldn't
deal with that pain.

15:48.439 --> 15:51.373
So you cut class,
you went home,

15:51.408 --> 15:53.608
and you threw away the books.

15:53.644 --> 15:55.143
You don't know what I did.

15:55.179 --> 15:57.979
What I do know is that your
parents came here every Sunday

15:57.981 --> 16:00.348
and donated money
to pay for that uniform

16:00.384 --> 16:02.517
because they wanted you to
be here getting an education

16:02.519 --> 16:03.769
and not cutting class.

16:03.821 --> 16:05.537
I've gotten a perfect grade
on every assignment

16:05.572 --> 16:07.089
I've ever gotten,
all right?

16:07.124 --> 16:09.057
And I don't need to go to
your stupid class to do it.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.358
I could have suspended you,

16:10.394 --> 16:11.927
and that would have been
much worse than an F.

16:11.962 --> 16:14.196
But you're getting one
or you're getting the other.

16:14.231 --> 16:17.966
So why don't you take
one night off from blaming me,

16:17.968 --> 16:20.769
and you decided what it is
that you're gonna do?

16:21.839 --> 16:22.839
Harvey,

16:22.890 --> 16:23.972
what are you doing here?

16:24.007 --> 16:26.541
I wanted to
ask you something.

16:26.577 --> 16:27.959
I was wondering if
I could stay with you

16:28.011 --> 16:29.728
while I do my clerkship.

16:29.763 --> 16:32.197
You want to stay with me
for the summer?

16:32.232 --> 16:34.032
I promise you won't
even know I'm there.

16:34.068 --> 16:35.417
Are you crazy?

16:35.452 --> 16:37.886
Do you have any idea what the
people around here would think

16:37.888 --> 16:38.987
if they found out?

16:39.022 --> 16:40.505
Who says
they're gonna find out?

16:40.541 --> 16:42.674
I mean, no one knows anything
about your personal life anyway.

16:42.726 --> 16:44.793
Harvey, what's going on?

16:44.828 --> 16:46.094
Things aren't good
at home.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.295
Your brother?

16:47.331 --> 16:48.997
It's my parents.

16:49.032 --> 16:50.532
Listen, Harvey,
I know what it's like

16:50.567 --> 16:52.417
to be living in a home
that's not right,

16:52.469 --> 16:55.337
and I also know that you might
be tempted to fix things.

16:55.339 --> 16:57.005
But it's not up to
the children to fix things.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.107
What if it was?

16:59.143 --> 17:00.609
Then there's something wrong
with those two people.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.210
No, there isn't.

17:02.246 --> 17:03.879
There's something wrong
with one of them,

17:03.914 --> 17:08.650
and I don't know whether to
tell the other one or not.

17:08.652 --> 17:12.020
Look, Harvey, I can't
tell you what you should do.

17:12.071 --> 17:15.891
But I can tell you
if you come work for me,

17:15.893 --> 17:18.292
you're gonna have to have
some difficult conversations.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.861
That's work,
this is family.

17:19.896 --> 17:23.799
There are no more difficult
conversations than that.

17:25.219 --> 17:28.386
But for the record,

17:28.422 --> 17:32.007
if you do come work here,

17:32.059 --> 17:36.061
we're gonna be family, too.

17:42.230 --> 17:44.665
Hey there.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.800
Your father and Marcus
will be here any minute,

17:46.836 --> 17:49.236
and, oh, I made your favorite,
chicken parm.

17:49.271 --> 17:50.454
I'm glad they're not here.

17:50.489 --> 17:51.805
It'll give me a chance
to tell you that

17:51.841 --> 17:53.373
I'll pretend
when they're here,

17:53.409 --> 17:55.709
but I am not gonna pretend
when we're alone.

17:55.745 --> 17:58.212
Harvey, please,
I'm still your mother.

17:58.247 --> 17:59.279
No, you're not.

17:59.315 --> 18:01.415
Hey, hey, hey,
look who's here.

18:01.450 --> 18:04.068
I thought you were
working late tonight.

18:04.103 --> 18:05.953
What's up,
douche nozzle?

18:05.988 --> 18:07.988
You remember Bobby from down
at the shop, don't you, Harvey?

18:08.023 --> 18:10.357
<i>He's helping us get</i>
<i>the old Mustang up and running.</i>

18:10.392 --> 18:12.843
That's right, Harvey,
I'm getting the Mustang.

18:12.895 --> 18:14.194
And if you think you're ever
getting behind the wheel

18:14.230 --> 18:15.529
of that car--

18:15.564 --> 18:16.730
I'm never gonna get behind
the wheel of that car.

18:16.766 --> 18:17.781
Because you're jealous.

18:17.833 --> 18:18.832
Because that car's
a piece of shit.

18:18.868 --> 18:21.018
Harvey, watch your mouth.

18:21.053 --> 18:23.771
Lil, do we have enough for
an extra plate?

18:23.806 --> 18:25.339
Sure.
How you doing, Bobby?

18:25.391 --> 18:27.941
I'll be good as soon as
I get this grease off my hands.

18:27.993 --> 18:29.159
Where's the bathroom again?

18:29.211 --> 18:31.411
It's down the hall, Bobby.

18:31.447 --> 18:32.846
You know what?

18:32.882 --> 18:34.131
We don't need an extra plate
'cause I'm not eating.

18:34.166 --> 18:35.649
What are you talking about?
You're home early.

18:35.684 --> 18:36.583
Your mother made
chicken parm.

18:36.619 --> 18:37.885
Well, why don't you eat it?

18:37.920 --> 18:39.853
Because I can't stand
chicken parm anymore.

18:39.889 --> 18:41.638
Where you going?
Harvey!

18:41.690 --> 18:45.192
This is still my house,
you know.

18:45.227 --> 18:47.528
Is it?

18:48.998 --> 18:51.698
So other people know
about you?

18:51.734 --> 18:54.735
Not everyone
knows everything, but...

18:56.038 --> 18:59.156
people know that
I don't have a law degree.

18:59.208 --> 19:02.509
You say that as though
it were just a technicality.

19:02.545 --> 19:04.678
And you say that
as if you're judging me.

19:04.713 --> 19:07.080
Isn't that what you
came here for?

19:07.116 --> 19:08.215
I came here for advice.

19:08.250 --> 19:10.584
You said you came here
to confess.

19:10.619 --> 19:13.153
But it doesn't matter,
because if--

19:13.189 --> 19:14.354
well, if you're looking
for absolution,

19:14.390 --> 19:15.355
I can't give it to you.

19:15.391 --> 19:16.391
Why not?

19:16.425 --> 19:19.760
Because absolution
requires contrition,

19:19.795 --> 19:21.395
and I'm not hearing that
you even think

19:21.430 --> 19:22.629
you've done anything wrong.

19:22.665 --> 19:23.664
Because using my brain
to help people

19:23.699 --> 19:25.132
isn't doing anything wrong.

19:25.134 --> 19:26.834
You're not using
your brain to help people.

19:26.869 --> 19:28.519
You're using it to
fool people,

19:28.554 --> 19:30.838
and you want me to tell you that
you're a good person for it.

19:30.873 --> 19:32.072
I am a good person.

19:32.107 --> 19:33.774
You're a person that
wants to have their cake

19:33.809 --> 19:35.175
and eat it, too.

19:35.211 --> 19:36.743
And I'm afraid that
I'm all out of cake with you.

19:36.779 --> 19:37.945
What is that
supposed to mean?

19:37.980 --> 19:40.247
It means that
I've often wondered

19:40.282 --> 19:41.648
whether or not
I did the right thing

19:41.684 --> 19:43.283
by not having you arrested
that day.

19:43.319 --> 19:45.118
That would have completely
screwed up my life.

19:45.154 --> 19:48.522
Oh, and look at how not
screwed up it is right now.

20:07.209 --> 20:08.775
I was hoping

20:08.811 --> 20:12.479
we're missing $936

20:12.514 --> 20:13.814
I can't.

20:13.849 --> 20:17.150
Well, that's odd,

20:34.470 --> 20:35.836
So you're dropping out?

20:35.871 --> 20:37.771
No, I'm going to

20:37.806 --> 20:39.840
And I'm not saying that
I took that cash,

20:39.875 --> 20:41.575
but if I did, I'd be
smart enough to do the math.

20:41.610 --> 20:45.445
My parents put $3 in the
collection plate every week.

20:45.481 --> 20:47.881
$3 a week for 52 weeks
for six years--

20:47.917 --> 20:50.450
$936.

20:50.486 --> 20:53.520
And I would have thought that
belonged to my parents

20:53.572 --> 20:57.457
and I would have just been
taking it back.

20:59.361 --> 21:01.295
You know, I could
have you arrested.

21:01.330 --> 21:02.479
Then do it.

21:02.514 --> 21:03.931
Michael, we both know
how smart you are,

21:03.966 --> 21:06.767

intelligence and wisdom.

21:06.802 --> 21:08.502
And if you don't figure
that out eventually,

21:08.537 --> 21:10.170
you're gonna have a lot bigger
problems than an F,

21:10.205 --> 21:11.471
because you can't outsmart--

21:11.507 --> 21:12.406
God?

21:12.441 --> 21:13.607
I know.

21:13.642 --> 21:16.043
I know you don't believe
in God,

21:16.045 --> 21:19.513

Maybe you did it

31:42.357 --> 31:43.990
For me to suggest that
maybe she'll understand

31:44.026 --> 31:46.493
that you leaving doesn't mean
that you don't care about her.

31:46.528 --> 31:48.145

Jack Soloff and Daniel Hardman

do business with,
one who's already behind bars.

36:34.649 --> 36:36.349
<i>Look, let me be clear.</i>

36:36.385 --> 36:39.586
<i>The attack on this firm was</i>
<i>an attack on me.</i>

36:39.621 --> 36:43.056
<i>Daniel blamed me</i>
<i>for having to leave this firm,</i>

36:43.091 --> 36:47.327
<i>so he was trying to hit me</i>
<i>where it hurt the most,</i>

36:47.362 --> 36:49.329
<i>namely this firm</i>

36:49.381 --> 36:53.933
<i>and my partners</i>
<i>and my friends.</i>

36:53.969 --> 36:55.502
But that's over.

36:55.537 --> 36:57.604
He has no more money,

36:57.639 --> 36:59.839
no more power,
no more friends.

36:59.875 --> 37:03.276
<i>All of you,</i>
<i>you're about to vote on whether</i>

37:03.311 --> 37:05.695
<i>Jessica should continue</i>
<i>running this firm.</i>

37:05.731 --> 37:08.531
<i>Now, I know some of you think</i>
<i>that she's turned a blind eye</i>

37:08.583 --> 37:11.851
<i>to my behavior</i>
<i>and--and the risks I've taken,</i>

37:11.887 --> 37:15.588
<i>but for you to remove her would</i>
<i>be the greatest risk of all.</i>

37:15.624 --> 37:18.374
<i>Because if there's one thing</i>
