[Jada]  Previously
on  The Chi...

00:06.673 --> 00:08.174
Looks like we got
some time to kill

00:08.216 --> 00:09.801
before our luncheon
on the North Side.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.012
Are you the candidate?

00:12.053 --> 00:13.513
[scoffs]
I was only trying to help.

00:13.555 --> 00:16.599
- I got it from here.
- Excuse me?

00:16.641 --> 00:18.351
Take your ass home.

How you gonna break into
a safe without the combination?

00:25.233 --> 00:28.153
Eleven, twenty-seven,
forty-six.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.409
- How much you want for it?
- Just consider it a gift.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.536
Thank you for coming
to Smokey's Barbecue.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.830
We got the best barbecue
in The Chi.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.416
You can have your money back
if I'm lying.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.668
[cheers and applause]

00:45.378 --> 00:47.756
H-hold up. Before we all go
inside, before we go inside,

00:49.132 --> 00:50.925
I ain't gonna lie.
I never thought I'd be blessed

00:50.967 --> 00:52.886
to have a woman like you
in my life.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.722
You been down with me
through all the bullshit.

00:55.764 --> 00:56.598
Will you marry me?

00:56.639 --> 00:57.891
Yes.

00:57.932 --> 01:00.351
[cheers and applause]

01:00.393 --> 01:01.895
[groans]

01:01.936 --> 01:05.315
When I was 16 years old,
my dad caught me in drag.

01:05.356 --> 01:08.068
He pulled a knife on me
and tried to kill me.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.653
He had this crazy look
in his eyes,

01:10.695 --> 01:12.238
and I knew right then and there

01:12.280 --> 01:16.034
it was gonna either
be him or me.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.994
And it wasn't gonna be me.

01:22.791 --> 01:25.085
[breathes shakily]

01:25.126 --> 01:26.711
It's okay,
I'm gonna get you home.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.601
No.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.103
Look, don't worry.

01:43.144 --> 01:45.438
This will all
be over real soon.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.941
Feel like I owe you my life.

01:47.982 --> 01:49.567
No.

01:49.609 --> 01:50.777
You don't owe me.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.113
I had to kill him.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.489
Right?

01:54.531 --> 01:56.908
I killed someone,

01:56.950 --> 01:59.077
and I see his face every day.

02:32.610 --> 02:36.322
Is done

02:36.364 --> 02:39.784
Have mercy

even if we are absent
from the body,

03:18.198 --> 03:19.866
we're still present
with the spirit.

03:19.908 --> 03:23.036
- Amen?
- [all] Amen.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.872
Ronald Davis
has left his body, but...

03:27.207 --> 03:29.292
...his spirit will live on
forever.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.962
Today we--

03:33.004 --> 03:35.715
we mourn his flesh.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.426
Today we mourn his humanness.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.554
Today we will lay him to rest,

03:41.596 --> 03:44.224
and he will meet his
grandmother on the other side.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.600
[Kiesha breathing shakily]

03:45.642 --> 03:49.520
[Jackson]  Brother Ronald
was a complicated man.

03:49.562 --> 03:52.398
But he wasn't too complicated
for the Lord.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.401
Brother Ronald
used his past as fuel...

03:55.443 --> 03:58.446
Kiesha.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.823
[Jackson]  ...to propel
himself forward.

04:00.865 --> 04:04.494
Brother Ronald never
stopped searching for himself.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.287
Brother Ronald
never stopped searching

04:06.329 --> 04:08.706
for the God in everyone else.

04:08.748 --> 04:12.043
Brother Ronald...

04:12.085 --> 04:15.380
wasn't afraid of the God
in himself.

to say any final words

04:48.204 --> 04:52.500

06:00.777 --> 06:02.111
Man, niggas can't have shit.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.863

06:03.905 --> 06:05.907
A man is dead.

06:05.948 --> 06:09.202
It ain't always about you.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.620
I'm sorry.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.663
Yeah, you are.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.501
[Emmett] Hey.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.378
You okay?

06:18.419 --> 06:20.129
Yeah.

06:20.171 --> 06:23.549
I don't believe you.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.719
Honestly, I don't know
how I'm supposed to feel.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.513
[scoffs]

06:28.554 --> 06:31.349

06:31.391 --> 06:33.643
I'm always here if you need
somebody to talk to.

06:36.437 --> 06:38.648
I don't wanna talk
to you about this.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.734
Come on, try me.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.820
I'm pregnant.

06:43.861 --> 06:46.906
Whoa.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.242
Oh, shit.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.580
That's the first time
a girl said that to me

06:54.622 --> 06:56.958
and I'm a hundred percent
sure the baby ain't mine.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.044
- Bye.
- W-wait.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.254
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
That--

07:09.345 --> 07:11.305
I don't know.

07:13.057 --> 07:15.101
I'm still trying
to figure it out.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.651
I know a couple of niggas
that's happy he dead.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.820
Damn, that's cold.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.238
He killed somebody.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.948
But at least he saved
my sister.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.741
That don't make him a saint.

to your daddy.

I heard it on a gospel album.

or Donnie McClurkin.

07:55.349 --> 07:57.435
- You're under arrest.
- For what?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.145
You have the right
to remain silent.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.396
Anything you say
can and will

08:00.438 --> 08:01.689
be used against you
in a court of law.

08:01.731 --> 08:02.982
What's going on?

08:03.024 --> 08:04.358
You have the right
to an attorney.

If you cannot afford
an attorney,

08:06.152 --> 08:07.445

waste no time.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.083
Huh.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.543
Yeah, that's why
we gotta leave early,

08:22.585 --> 08:24.378
'cause I gotta go look at
a venue for the reception.

08:24.420 --> 08:27.298
Wait, I-I thought the reception
was at Red Lobster.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.343
- It was too expensive.
- Damn.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.637
Did you make the appointment
for the marriage license?

08:32.678 --> 08:34.472
Yeah, yeah.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.557
I think-I think--
yeah, I think so.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.310
- You think so?
- Why the rush?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.187
W-we just feel like it's time.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.481
- It's about time.
- Calm down.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.857
[Tiff] Don't tell me
to calm down.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.693
And I'm very calm,
because if I wanted to,

08:47.735 --> 08:49.529
I can go off about the fact
that you forgot

08:49.570 --> 08:51.197
to make the appointment
for the marriage license,

08:51.239 --> 08:54.325
and you just lied
to my face about it.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.868
But I ain't gonna trip.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.203
'Cause I know you gonna
take care of that shit

08:57.245 --> 08:58.955
once we leave here, right?

08:58.996 --> 09:00.373
I'm not gonna respond to that.

09:00.414 --> 09:03.417
Whatever, you know I'm right.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.378
Are you guys sure you're
ready to get married?

09:05.419 --> 09:07.505
- Hell yeah.
- I been ready.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.298
We gonna take
the money from our wedding

09:09.340 --> 09:11.092
and use it as a deposit
for our new apartment.

09:11.133 --> 09:12.760
Plus, between her
new business and mine,

09:12.802 --> 09:14.470
we can finally start
saving some money.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.638
Yeah.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.973
Well, who are you
trying to convince,

09:17.014 --> 09:18.766
me or yourselves?

09:18.808 --> 09:21.435
- Huh?
- What you mean?

09:21.477 --> 09:23.896
Don't let this dashiki
or my three degrees fool you.

the facts, no printer.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.026
You wanna get married, fine.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.528
But understand
it's not something

09:30.570 --> 09:32.280
you should enter into lightly.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.907
Marriage is a huge commitment,

09:34.949 --> 09:37.410
and both parties need to be
mature enough to handle it.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.536

09:40.413 --> 09:43.124
- We--like, we not mature?
- Right.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.709
I'm just saying
marriage isn't something

09:44.750 --> 09:46.669
you should rush into.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.423
He shoulda been proposed.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.216
You gonna give us
your blessing or not?

09:52.258 --> 09:54.260
You don't need my blessing
to get married.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.762
You know what, you're right.
Sure don't.

09:56.804 --> 09:59.265

I'm betting it all in...

taking some money

10:30.129 --> 10:31.589
That ain't illegal.

Could be.

kind of criminality.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.479
And we are?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.276
Bro.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.654
That's fucked up, bro.

10:54.695 --> 10:57.406
I'm sorry,
but this is stressing me out.

10:57.448 --> 11:00.493
My mom won't tell me nothing,

11:00.534 --> 11:01.994
and my dad the head
of the household.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.913
If he go to jail,
do that mean I gotta be

11:03.954 --> 11:05.289
the head of the house?

11:05.331 --> 11:07.833
I gotta take care of my mom
and Maisha.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.001
[Papa] This too much.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.836
Bro, hit this, please.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.506
That's the cookies,
you can nab me, dab me

11:13.547 --> 11:15.424
Now get the cream
like gag me, lash me

11:15.466 --> 11:16.842
Got me some of that,
it's tacky, jab me...

11:16.884 --> 11:18.135
[coughing]

11:18.177 --> 11:21.180
- Chill.
- Damn.

11:21.222 --> 11:25.142
Now if the end
of the world comes,

11:25.184 --> 11:27.311
I ain't gonna be ready for it.

11:27.353 --> 11:32.024
gentle music

11:32.066 --> 11:34.860
Voter turnout is
extremely high this year.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.488
What remains to be seen
is exactly which candidate

11:37.530 --> 11:39.699
the people
are turning out for.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.367
Otis Perry and
Camille Hallaway

11:41.409 --> 11:42.910
have galvanized--

11:42.952 --> 11:45.371
Hey, got a minute?

11:45.413 --> 11:47.373
Yeah, you know I'm--

11:47.415 --> 11:50.876
let's walk and talk.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.212
Judge decides who gets
custody of Jake today.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.880
- Good luck.
- Yeah, thank you.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.675
Pastor Jackson
was arrested today.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.052
- For what?
- Money laundering.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.637
And of course he doesn't
want to go to prison,

12:01.679 --> 12:03.723
so he is singing
like a bird.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.559
dark music

12:10.438 --> 12:12.982
I'm glad you came to me.

12:13.023 --> 12:15.568
Me too.

12:15.609 --> 12:17.695
I know my mama wanted
to hold my hand through this,

12:17.737 --> 12:21.741
but that's not what I need.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.909
I get that.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.746
And you know
whatever you say to me

12:26.787 --> 12:29.582
is between us.

12:29.623 --> 12:32.042
Thank you.

12:32.084 --> 12:35.546
Ask anything.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.466
What would you do?

12:38.507 --> 12:40.634
If you were me.

12:40.676 --> 12:43.304
I was your age
when I had Emmett.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.264
Any regrets?

12:45.306 --> 12:46.974
No.

12:47.016 --> 12:50.728
But I do wish somebody
told me my options.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.648
'Cause back then
if you got pregnant,

12:54.690 --> 12:58.486
you know, I just assumed
you had to have the baby.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.613
And I know that's not true.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.703
I'm scared.

13:07.745 --> 13:11.290
I was too.

13:11.332 --> 13:14.460
What if I make
the wrong choice?

13:14.502 --> 13:18.547
Kiesha,
whatever choice you make,

13:18.589 --> 13:20.883
it's the right one.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.427
gentle music

13:23.469 --> 13:26.597
Look...
[sighs]

13:26.639 --> 13:28.808
I know you wanted
to talk to me,

13:28.849 --> 13:32.603
but I think

13:32.645 --> 13:34.605
I know someone that might
be better equipped

13:34.647 --> 13:36.816
to have this conversation.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.698
Would you take a breath?

13:44.740 --> 13:45.991
I'm nervous.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.451
I can tell.

13:47.493 --> 13:51.038
Your neck muscles
are tight as shit.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.998
You need a Xani.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.125
I can't lose him, babe.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.169
We won't.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.512
Why the fuck hasn't Camille
used the shit

14:06.554 --> 14:07.638
we gave her on Douda yet?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.098
Hey, don't worry about her.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.516
Just show it to the judge.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.560
The judge don't care
about this shit.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.521
Besides,
I want this nigga tried

14:15.563 --> 14:17.147
by the court of public opinion.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.858
Just breathe.

14:18.899 --> 14:21.277
[inhales deeply]

14:21.318 --> 14:23.153
[exhales]

14:23.195 --> 14:25.197
We got this.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.412
What if we do win?

14:34.915 --> 14:37.042
Then we're gonna be a family.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.840
Well, what if--

14:42.882 --> 14:46.552
what if I don't know
how to lead-lead the family?

14:49.597 --> 14:52.683
Then we're gonna lead together.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.394
light jazz music

15:10.618 --> 15:12.745
Hey.

15:16.707 --> 15:18.876
I'm so sorry about
what happened to you.

15:22.796 --> 15:25.090
Jada said she couldn't
tell me what was going on.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.512
I'm pregnant.

15:30.554 --> 15:34.099
gentle music

15:34.141 --> 15:36.268
And I'm assuming
you don't wanna be?

15:37.811 --> 15:40.522
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

15:41.482 --> 15:42.900
Got it.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.193
[distant sirens]

15:46.570 --> 15:50.074
Me and Emmett found ourselves
in a situation last year,

15:50.115 --> 15:52.117
and I didn't know
what I wanted to do,

15:52.159 --> 15:55.621
but ultimately
I had to look at my life

15:55.663 --> 15:58.791
and decide if I wanted to bring
another child into this world.

15:58.832 --> 16:01.502
And, uh, after a lot
of soul searching,

16:01.543 --> 16:02.920
I realized that the one I got

16:02.962 --> 16:04.630
is all I could handle
right now.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.093
How long did you soul search?

16:09.134 --> 16:12.012
A few weeks.

16:12.054 --> 16:15.099
Can't take
too much time though.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.476
I know.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.897
Just trust yourself.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.657
[scoffs]
Gonna make me cry.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.830
Thank you.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.849
I can't believe this nigga
made us come into work today.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.351
I know.
I can't focus on shit.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.686
Me either.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.146
My whole life could change
in a few hours.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.565
Yeah, just hope Trig
got his shit together.

17:04.606 --> 17:07.735
Me too.

17:07.776 --> 17:10.612
And Trig said he was gonna
handle this nigga.

17:10.654 --> 17:12.656
He need to hurry the fuck up.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.324
[indistinct chatter]

17:14.366 --> 17:17.786
Hey, boys.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.664
What y'all saw earlier
was just a misunderstanding.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.291
That's all.

17:22.332 --> 17:24.501
[Jackson] Nothing for you
to be worried about.

17:24.543 --> 17:27.087
But I am worried about it.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.797
Son, didn't I teach you
that faith and fear

17:28.839 --> 17:30.466
can't exist in the same space?

17:30.507 --> 17:32.342
[scoffs]
How faithful are you?

17:32.384 --> 17:33.594
Boy, watch your mouth.

17:33.635 --> 17:34.595
I'm tired
of watching my mouth.

17:34.636 --> 17:35.888
You are still a child.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.389
I ain't gonna be
a child forever.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.184
[smooth hip-hop
playing over sound system]

17:50.360 --> 17:52.905
Uh-huh.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.240
Yep.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.700
Well yeah, man, I mean,

17:56.742 --> 17:59.995
I'm not gonna concede until
all the votes are counted.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.748
All right, man.
Let's keep hope alive.

18:04.958 --> 18:08.003
Okay, keep me posted.
All right, peace.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.507
Why haven't you done
anything with the file?

18:11.548 --> 18:13.759
I thought about it,

18:13.801 --> 18:16.678
and then I realized as much as
I wanna beat this motherfucker,

18:16.720 --> 18:17.971
I don't wanna
beat him that way.

18:18.013 --> 18:20.516
Who cares how you beat him
as long as you win?

18:20.557 --> 18:22.101
Why do you want me
to win so bad?

18:22.142 --> 18:24.645
Because you and I both know
Douda ain't shit.

18:24.686 --> 18:26.522
He ain't, but you the one
married to him.

18:26.563 --> 18:27.731
So what does that make you?

18:27.773 --> 18:28.899
I'm trying to help you.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.401
No.
You're trying to use me.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.820
'Cause you mad at him.

18:32.861 --> 18:34.321
He ain't been treating you
like an equal,

18:34.363 --> 18:36.115
so you want to get back at him
by taking away

18:36.156 --> 18:38.784
the thing he wants the most,
but you can't do it

18:38.826 --> 18:40.661
'cause you gotta keep him
in your back pocket.

18:40.702 --> 18:42.454
So you wanna use me to do it.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.206
Which I get.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.792
But look, I've been
a lot of things in my life,

18:46.834 --> 18:48.710
and a pawn ain't one of them.

18:48.752 --> 18:49.962
Sorry, boo.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.131
[indistinct chatter]

18:54.675 --> 18:56.718
You look good though.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.804
I like the outfit.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.973
The red look is working.

smooth jazz music

19:10.524 --> 19:12.151
[horn blares]

19:12.192 --> 19:15.070
Whoo-whoo-ooh.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.364
- Look at him!
- [Darnell chuckles]

19:17.406 --> 19:19.616
Ooh, I'm 'bout to
fuck 'em up with this.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.827
[Jada] Why don't you focus
on being a good husband

19:21.869 --> 19:23.412
instead of a fly groom?

19:23.453 --> 19:27.291
Man, stop raining
on the boy's parade, woman.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.334
- [chuckles]
- [Emmett talking indistinctly]

19:31.587 --> 19:33.338
You look beautiful.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.007
- Thank you.
- Hold up.

19:35.048 --> 19:37.342
Gotta have something borrowed.

19:39.469 --> 19:41.263
Here you go.

19:41.305 --> 19:44.349
[Emmett and Darnell
talking indistinctly]

19:46.894 --> 19:49.062
[Jada] Mm-hmm.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.863
Thank you so much
for putting up with me

19:57.905 --> 19:59.698
and Emmett and the baby.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.533
And stepping in for my mom.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.118
Look, I get it.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.704
And if I was your mom,
I don't know if I'd approve

20:05.746 --> 20:06.872
of you marrying
my son either.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.208
[both chuckle]

20:09.249 --> 20:11.960
I know,
but he's grown so much.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.503
[sighs]
That's true.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.298
But even I can admit,
he got a lot of growing to do.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.382
Don't we all?

20:17.424 --> 20:20.552
You're right.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.596
I know he ain't perfect,

20:22.638 --> 20:25.349
but he perfect for me.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.725
[Emmett laughing]

20:26.767 --> 20:29.519
I'm really glad Emmett
found you.

20:29.561 --> 20:30.938
'Cause I'm the only one
that's willing

20:30.979 --> 20:32.189
to put up with his ass.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.857
[laughter]

20:33.899 --> 20:35.108
You know I can
hear y'all, right?

20:35.150 --> 20:37.236
[laughs]

20:39.780 --> 20:41.865
D, where you get
this shit from?

20:41.907 --> 20:43.075
What you mean?

20:43.116 --> 20:45.118
This shit is expensive
as hell.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.454
Where you get the money
for my suit and Tiff's dress?

20:47.496 --> 20:48.789
My guy hooked me up.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.916
Now stop asking questions.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.210
- Come on.
- All right.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.761
What the fuck,
you stole this shit?

21:02.803 --> 21:04.763
We borrowing it.
I know the owner.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.932
Then why he leave
the sensor on?

21:08.058 --> 21:09.935
Musta forgot to take it off.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.188
[mutters indistinctly]

21:13.230 --> 21:14.856
- Hey!
- Boy, what you doing?

21:14.898 --> 21:16.775
You know you're not supposed
to see me before the wedding.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.277
No, fuck all that.
We can't wear this shit.

21:18.318 --> 21:19.236
Why not?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.196
'Cause it's stolen.
Look.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.448
- I don't care.
- Really, Tiff?

21:23.490 --> 21:25.242
We're not gonna wear
this shit again no way.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.369
Might as well get it for free.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.913
[sighs]
Jeez.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.957
[stammers]

21:31.999 --> 21:34.626

21:48.348 --> 21:50.767
You nervous?

21:50.809 --> 21:52.978
No, I'm good.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.649
Shit, I am.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.571
Me too.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.115
Don't worry.
We got this.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.118
gentle music

22:11.872 --> 22:15.000
I don't care
what that judge says.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.085
You always gonna be my family.

my  boca...

- [Bria] Okay now.

22:45.405 --> 22:48.575
- Don't hurt nobody.
- Work, honey.

on that dick!

Ooh, I so wish
I could un-hear that.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.876
Could you just cover up
for a second

22:57.918 --> 22:59.419
so we could
get into this game?

22:59.461 --> 23:01.713
- Who wants mimosas?
- Yes.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.341
- I will take.
- Yep.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.676
Nisha, now you know
you just got a DUI last month.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.762
You ain't got no business
drinking right now, girl.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.055
You ain't gotta call
a bitch out.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.640
I'm just saying.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.725
So what's the game?

23:13.767 --> 23:16.061
It's called

23:16.103 --> 23:17.729
"The Groom Says What?"

23:17.771 --> 23:21.358
Okay, now what it is,

23:21.400 --> 23:24.069
is I sent Emmett a bunch
of questions about Tiff,

23:24.111 --> 23:26.905
and he wrote down
his answers...

23:26.947 --> 23:28.740
with his awful handwriting.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.158
So y'all, hold up,
bear with me.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.660
Questions like what?

23:31.701 --> 23:33.245
Like...

23:33.286 --> 23:35.414
what's your favorite food?

23:35.455 --> 23:36.498
Oh, chicharróns.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.041
He better have said
chicharróns,

23:38.083 --> 23:40.043
'cause he know I love me
some chicharróns.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.170
- Yeah, girl, we know.
- You already know.

23:42.212 --> 23:44.923
Yeah, he said
mac and cheese.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.092
- [sighs]
- [Jada chuckles]

23:47.134 --> 23:49.428
- He fucking up already.
- [Jada] Mm-hmm.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.721
[chuckles] Where'd y'all
have your first date?

23:51.763 --> 23:53.765
It shoulda been
Cheesecake Factory,

23:53.807 --> 23:55.892
but he was broke,
so we went to White Castle.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.644
- Oh, what?
- [chuckles]

23:57.686 --> 23:59.771
Girl, them onion rings
be poppin'.

23:59.813 --> 24:02.482
And you know he said
the Cheesecake Factory.

24:02.524 --> 24:04.067
How that nigga
gonna say he took me

24:04.109 --> 24:05.527
to the Cheesecake Factory?

24:05.569 --> 24:07.320
He need to stop smoking
all that weed,

24:07.362 --> 24:09.948
'cause it's fucking
with his memory, for real.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.533
Okay, what did Emmett say

24:11.575 --> 24:13.452
was the thing he loved
about you the most?

24:13.493 --> 24:15.579
It's only real
in my clique

24:15.620 --> 24:17.789
It's only real in my whip,
whip it, whip it...

24:17.831 --> 24:20.584
I already know.
My booty.

24:20.625 --> 24:21.751
Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.420
- Hey.
- Yes.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.464
Your booty and your loyalty.

24:25.505 --> 24:26.631
Ohh.

24:26.673 --> 24:28.800
The buss down,
a gold crown...

24:28.842 --> 24:30.218
I am a loyal bitch.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.803
Girl, you already know.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.054
Bitch, please don't ruin
that Fenty foundation

24:33.096 --> 24:34.306
I just put on you.

24:34.347 --> 24:36.641
- Girl, we good.
- [Devyn] Mm-hmm.

24:36.683 --> 24:39.394
Tiff, I just wanna say,

24:39.436 --> 24:43.482
I'm grateful to you
for standing by him.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.275
I feel like I've gained
a daughter.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.319
- Ohh.
- Welcome to the family.

24:47.360 --> 24:51.156
- Aww.
- [chuckles]

24:51.198 --> 24:52.991
All right,
let's cheers to that.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.659
- Cheers.
- All right.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.536
Cheers.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.455
Talk about dress code
and heckling

24:58.497 --> 24:59.873
Now we out here
and they welcoming

24:59.915 --> 25:01.374
Maybe 'cause
the money prevalent

25:01.416 --> 25:04.127
Maybe my success
is evident

25:06.171 --> 25:08.632
I don't wanna live
with Mr. Perry.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.634
He ain't my family.

25:10.675 --> 25:13.345
[judge] Has he not taken
good care of you?

25:13.386 --> 25:15.472
Look,

25:15.514 --> 25:18.600
I never got the chance
to know my brother, but...

25:18.642 --> 25:20.936
we've been spending a lot
of time with each other,

25:20.977 --> 25:23.647
and it's been good for us.

25:23.688 --> 25:27.275
I know him and Imani ain't
always been perfect, but...

25:27.317 --> 25:29.486
they care about me.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.447
And they care
about each other.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.199
[Jake] I feel safe
when I'm with them.

25:35.992 --> 25:37.202
I hope you decide to give

25:37.244 --> 25:39.538
my brother and his wife
full custody.

25:39.579 --> 25:42.374
I think that's
what would be best for me.

25:42.415 --> 25:44.626
[judge] Thank you
for your remarks, Jacob.

25:44.668 --> 25:47.504
This is normally
when I would ask Mr. Perry

25:47.546 --> 25:51.049
for his testimony,
but he isn't here.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.051
Where's your client?

25:53.093 --> 25:54.678
Uh, Your Honor,

25:54.719 --> 25:57.055
I'm sure there's
some sort of explanation.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.848
He knows how important this is.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.101
gentle music

26:01.142 --> 26:03.520
Mr. Taylor,
you are far from perfect,

26:03.562 --> 26:06.398
but the boy clearly loves you.

26:06.439 --> 26:09.693
And you clearly love the boy.

26:11.152 --> 26:13.572
Failure to appear
forces my hand.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.575
I'm ruling in favor
of Mr. Taylor.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.994
[gavel bangs]

26:19.035 --> 26:20.745
[inhales deeply]

26:23.623 --> 26:25.584
All right, man.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.843
[traffic noise, horns honking]

26:36.219 --> 26:39.347
[indistinct chatter]

26:43.143 --> 26:44.269
I'm gonna miss y'all.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.937
You really gonna quit?

26:45.979 --> 26:47.439
Yeah.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.524
I can't work
for this nigga no more.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.109
I feel you.

26:51.151 --> 26:52.527
So what y'all
about to get into?

26:52.569 --> 26:54.279
I already know what Kev
about to do.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.406
Bro, shut up.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.783
[chuckles] Nah, but tell Jemma
I said what's up.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.911
[door opens]

27:01.953 --> 27:03.955
- Maisha.
- Hey.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.874
[Papa]
How you know I was here?

27:05.915 --> 27:07.834
These fools texted me.

27:09.169 --> 27:10.420
I love y'all.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.213
We love you too, bro.

27:12.255 --> 27:14.924
Yeah, you're always
gonna be our brother.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.426
Come on, Papa.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.136
I got a surprise for you.

27:18.178 --> 27:19.512
Be easy on me, woman.

27:19.554 --> 27:22.432
My heart can't take
no more surprises today.

27:24.684 --> 27:27.437
Uh-uh, that girl
moves so fast.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.648
Yeah.

27:29.689 --> 27:33.151
[mellow pop music
playing over speakers]

27:33.193 --> 27:35.236
You said you wanted
to go public.

27:35.278 --> 27:38.573
Well, now I got the hottest boy
in the game wearing my chain.

27:38.615 --> 27:41.451
- You sure?
- Hell yeah.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.912
Thank you, Maisha.

27:43.953 --> 27:45.830
Queen.

27:45.872 --> 27:48.458
Thank you for seeing me

27:48.500 --> 27:51.336
and for lifting me up.

27:51.378 --> 27:54.005
Thank you for being
somebody I could lean on

27:54.047 --> 27:57.842
and reminding me that I don't
always gotta be perfect.

27:59.302 --> 28:00.929
I love you, Papa.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.263
I love you too, Maisha.

28:02.305 --> 28:03.556
Your dad okay?

28:03.598 --> 28:05.183
I still don't know
what happened.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.476
He didn't tell me shit.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.977
Did you ask?

28:08.019 --> 28:10.188
He just gonna tell me to stay
outta grown folks' business.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.731
But he made it your business

28:11.773 --> 28:13.525
when he got arrested
at Ronnie's funeral.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.360
I know.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.529
But the Bible still tells me
to "honor thy father."

28:17.570 --> 28:21.449
At some point,
you gotta honor thyself.

28:21.491 --> 28:24.160
All I can in front
of my friends

28:27.455 --> 28:30.041
[Emmett] Ooh, I know
this about to be great.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.960
[Darnell chuckles]

28:32.001 --> 28:33.545
Yeah, you gonna love this.

28:33.586 --> 28:36.131
- Yeah.
- Surprise!

28:36.172 --> 28:39.300
[indistinct chatter]

28:39.342 --> 28:41.636
What the--
where the strippers at?

28:41.678 --> 28:45.306
Oh, it was too expensive.

28:45.348 --> 28:47.225
Okay, where my boys at?

28:47.267 --> 28:49.644
I ain't got nobody's numbers.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.563
I coulda gave 'em to you.

28:51.604 --> 28:55.066
Boy, get yourself a massage
and be happy.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.735
Shoot, this is the last
peace and quiet

28:56.776 --> 29:00.071
you gonna get
for the rest of your life.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.240
Over here, come on.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.661
[laughter]

29:06.703 --> 29:08.455
So you ain't gonna
trust your man?

29:08.496 --> 29:10.248
[Bria] I don't trust
none of these niggas.

29:10.290 --> 29:11.624
Girl, what?

29:11.666 --> 29:13.501
My auntie trusted
a man once.

29:13.543 --> 29:15.795
He took all her money
and left her homeless.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.756
- [Bria] Homeless?
- I knew her auntie.

29:17.797 --> 29:20.717
No, y'all need to stop watching
Waiting to Exhale,  for real.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.719
- Like, no.
- [pounding on door]

29:22.761 --> 29:23.887
[officer] Police!

29:23.928 --> 29:25.680
Jada. Put that out.
Put that out.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.640
Okay.

29:27.682 --> 29:30.018
- Okay, I'm going.
- [pounding on door]

29:30.059 --> 29:31.686
[officer] Police, open up!

29:31.728 --> 29:33.730
- [woman] I don't know.
- [indistinct chatter]

29:37.734 --> 29:39.486
How can I help you, officer?

29:39.527 --> 29:41.029
Someone called
about a noise complaint.

29:41.070 --> 29:43.072
Uh, look, I'm so sorry,

29:43.114 --> 29:45.033
but we-we gonna keep it down,
I promise.

29:45.074 --> 29:46.868
It's a little too late
for an apology.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.746
Whoa, what you mean?

29:49.788 --> 29:51.456
Now I'm gonna have
to punish you.

29:51.498 --> 29:54.709
Punish me?
What is this?

29:54.751 --> 29:57.420
You said you didn't like
male strippers, so...

29:57.462 --> 29:59.088
[woman] That's what
I'm talking about!

29:59.130 --> 30:00.590
[laughter]

30:00.632 --> 30:03.301
Say you wanna
get up in my bed

30:03.343 --> 30:04.761
In my bed

30:04.803 --> 30:08.306
Even if it's
for a one-night stand

30:08.348 --> 30:09.891
Even if it's...

30:09.933 --> 30:11.726
Got the text,
you said you on your way

30:11.768 --> 30:13.478
On your way yeah

30:13.520 --> 30:17.148

30:17.190 --> 30:21.653
Say you wanna get up
in my bed

30:21.694 --> 30:25.824
Even if it's for
a one-night stand

30:25.865 --> 30:29.994
Got the text,
you said you on your way

30:30.036 --> 30:33.164
Fifty Shades of Grey,
it's time to play

30:33.206 --> 30:35.375
It's all on me

30:35.416 --> 30:37.794
Keep playing by the beach

30:37.836 --> 30:39.504
On the shore of the sea

30:39.546 --> 30:41.130
Black sand on the feet

30:41.172 --> 30:43.550
Body sure needs
some action

30:43.591 --> 30:45.844
I'ma cause a reaction

30:45.885 --> 30:47.345
Show you what
you been lacking

30:47.387 --> 30:49.681
I'm a sexual assassin

30:49.722 --> 30:51.724
I'm the type of nigga
that can please you

30:51.766 --> 30:53.977
Play nice for
the guilty pleasures

30:54.018 --> 30:56.312
- [sighs]
- [indistinct chatter]

30:56.354 --> 30:58.106
Really, Darnell?

30:58.147 --> 30:59.691
What?

30:59.732 --> 31:01.860
Man, I don't know these people
in here like that.

31:01.901 --> 31:04.028
Ain't trying to catch
no foot fungus.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.534
So, uh, you got Tiff
to sign a prenup yet?

31:09.576 --> 31:11.870
Why?
I ain't got no money.

31:11.911 --> 31:14.289
But you could always
come into some.

31:14.330 --> 31:17.000
If I do,
she deserves half of it.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.209
Says who?

31:18.251 --> 31:20.128
Says me.

31:20.169 --> 31:22.839
[sighs] Look, I know
y'all are poor now,

31:22.881 --> 31:25.300
but that don't mean you
gonna be poor all your life.

31:25.341 --> 31:28.386
And I'm hoping you're not,
'cause eventually

31:28.428 --> 31:31.014
I want y'all
to take care of me.

31:31.055 --> 31:32.223
And I'm telling you,

31:32.265 --> 31:33.850
she ain't gonna be
in love with you no more.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.894
She gonna hate your guts
and she gonna do

31:35.935 --> 31:38.021
everything she can
to make sure that you suffer.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.564
Trust me, I know.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.733
I'm not getting a prenup.

31:41.774 --> 31:43.902
All right, suit yourself.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.403
But if you don't do that,

31:45.445 --> 31:47.739
definitely need to get
that girl's tubes tied.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.782
Y'all can't afford
no more kids.

31:49.824 --> 31:51.576
- Hey, Darnell.
- Yeah?

31:51.618 --> 31:54.203
Can you stop talking, please?

31:54.245 --> 31:56.497
Man.

32:00.293 --> 32:02.170
You got to relax, man.

32:02.211 --> 32:05.840
Just chill.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.926
[sighs]

32:09.302 --> 32:10.887
Hi, are you two ready
for your couples massage?

32:10.929 --> 32:13.890
Uh, w-we ain't no couple.

32:13.932 --> 32:17.101
Hey, hey, coupon's only good

32:19.646 --> 32:22.273
Shit, we 'bout to get

32:22.315 --> 32:23.524
Oh, hell no.

32:23.566 --> 32:25.109
Why you tripping?

32:25.151 --> 32:26.861
We're gonna be on opposite
sides of the room.

32:26.903 --> 32:29.072
Ain't no way I'm finna
to get a massage next to you.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.281
How in the hell
am I supposed to relax

32:30.323 --> 32:31.950
knowing you're on the other
side of the room

32:31.991 --> 32:34.827
trying to talk your way
into a happy ending?

32:37.288 --> 32:38.498
Uh-uh, no, I ain't going.

32:38.539 --> 32:40.041
Oh, c--

32:41.334 --> 32:42.669
I'm married, I'm married.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.045
- [Darnell] Hey, hey!
- I can't be doing this.

32:45.296 --> 32:48.299
[sighs] Well, I guess
both of y'all

32:48.341 --> 32:50.510
just gonna have to work on me.

32:50.551 --> 32:52.095
[chuckles]

33:02.480 --> 33:05.274
Damn.

33:05.316 --> 33:08.319
What the--

33:08.361 --> 33:10.154
You look like you had
a much better time than me.

33:10.196 --> 33:12.824
Boy, your mama know
how to throw a party.

33:16.285 --> 33:18.997
What you doing home early?

33:19.038 --> 33:22.166
I missed my wife.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.627
Almost wife.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.338
Gonna be my wife
in a few days.

33:27.380 --> 33:29.173
I still can't believe
we getting married.

33:29.215 --> 33:32.093
Yeah.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.845
Shit is crazy.

33:33.886 --> 33:35.972
Mm-hmm.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.349
I'm glad we doing it though.

33:38.391 --> 33:40.601
Yeah, me too.

33:42.645 --> 33:44.480
Look, Tiff, you know
I ain't perfect, right?

33:44.522 --> 33:47.066
Nigga, I know.

33:47.108 --> 33:50.361
But ain't nobody perfect,
Emmett.

33:50.403 --> 33:52.363
You right.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.241
I stopped and got you
some Al's.

33:55.283 --> 33:57.368
You know I don't like
my sandwiches dipped.

33:58.536 --> 33:59.662
I got it regular for you.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.372
But you hate it like that.

34:01.414 --> 34:02.915
But you love it like that.

34:02.957 --> 34:04.959
Oh, so you trying
to get some tonight.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.919
No.

34:06.961 --> 34:08.963
[laughs]

34:09.005 --> 34:10.590
Yeah

34:10.631 --> 34:12.341
Yeah-ah

34:12.383 --> 34:14.135
Uh-uh

34:14.177 --> 34:16.345
Ah, ah, ah

34:16.387 --> 34:18.389
I know what
you're feeling for

34:18.431 --> 34:20.058
I know what you're
feeling for

34:20.099 --> 34:22.226
It's gotta be me for sure

34:22.268 --> 34:24.020
It's gotta be me

34:24.062 --> 34:26.981
You won't leave me alone,
leave me alone

34:27.023 --> 34:30.359
I'ma do you
like three below

34:30.401 --> 34:32.904
Yeah I've been
on low, low all day

34:32.945 --> 34:34.864
I'ma start,
no, no delay

34:34.906 --> 34:36.908
It gets fixed, don't stress,
I'm blessed don't mention

34:36.949 --> 34:38.201
I called you over
to play

34:38.242 --> 34:40.203
I feel like
you don't get it

34:40.244 --> 34:41.996
'Cause you ain't
right here with it

34:42.038 --> 34:43.915
Gimme that bell,
I'm in it in the next

34:43.956 --> 34:45.374
You lookin' like
a red rum lady

34:45.416 --> 34:46.417
Yeah, yeah

34:46.459 --> 34:47.919
You want another

34:47.960 --> 34:49.670
But I really ain't
looking for love

34:49.712 --> 34:51.881
I ain't feeling it now,
baby you been in the rough

34:51.923 --> 34:53.216
Right now I'm feeling
like uh-oh

34:53.257 --> 34:54.801
If I had a moment
I'd spend it with you

34:54.842 --> 34:56.594
Right now it's looking
like it would be trouble

34:56.636 --> 34:58.596
If I catch a minute,
I'm following up

34:58.638 --> 34:59.889
So can you let me get it
while I'm in the cut

34:59.931 --> 35:02.058
Oh yeah

35:02.100 --> 35:04.811
I want y'all
to hold your heads high.

35:04.852 --> 35:07.021
We ran a great campaign.

35:07.063 --> 35:08.940
We ran an honest campaign.

35:08.981 --> 35:11.818
I know change will come
to Chicago.

35:11.859 --> 35:14.362
Just not as soon
as I woulda hoped.

35:14.403 --> 35:15.988
But I get it.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.533
Most people don't like change

35:18.574 --> 35:20.993
even when it's
what they need the most,

35:21.035 --> 35:23.871
and I've learned
that real change

35:23.913 --> 35:26.290
comes slow or not at all.

35:26.332 --> 35:29.127
But lucky for y'all,
I'm willing to be patient.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.463
Let's keep going.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.132
The fight isn't over.

35:34.173 --> 35:37.301
We still have a lot
of work to do.

35:37.343 --> 35:39.262
I'm grateful for each
and every one of you,

35:39.303 --> 35:42.932
all the hard work you've done,
all the late nights.

35:42.974 --> 35:46.602
You have my deepest gratitude.

35:46.644 --> 35:49.647
God bless you and good night.

35:49.689 --> 35:52.608
[applause]

35:52.650 --> 35:55.403
gentle music

36:04.871 --> 36:06.998
Congratulations.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.170
Thank you.

36:12.211 --> 36:14.672
Why didn't you come
to the custody hearing?

36:19.343 --> 36:21.345
Why would I settle
for one brother...

36:23.514 --> 36:26.184
...when I can own
both of them?

36:38.404 --> 36:41.532
[clock ticking]

36:43.993 --> 36:46.370
uneasy music

36:46.412 --> 36:49.123
[ticking grows louder]

36:58.216 --> 36:59.717
[door opens]

36:59.759 --> 37:01.302
[footsteps approaching]

37:11.145 --> 37:13.189
You okay?

37:15.775 --> 37:17.443
I can't do it.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.614
gentle music

37:21.656 --> 37:22.531
[sighs]

37:27.787 --> 37:29.580
[Nina] Okay.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.207
[woman] You can reschedule.

37:31.249 --> 37:34.502
Are you sure you wanna
have this baby?

37:34.543 --> 37:38.214
Are you sure you wanna
raise this baby?

37:40.216 --> 37:42.218
I don't know
what I wanna do.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.178
[phone ringing,
indistinct chatter]

37:44.220 --> 37:47.348
I just know I don't
wanna go back in there.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.600
light music

37:49.642 --> 37:51.018
You know how people say

37:51.060 --> 37:54.105
everything happens
for a reason?

37:54.146 --> 37:58.025
Ma, what if this happened
for a reason?

37:58.067 --> 38:00.528
What if Ronnie's mom
aborted him?

38:02.154 --> 38:04.448
What woulda happened to me?

38:20.214 --> 38:22.508
[Nina] Oh, Kiesha, it's okay.

38:22.550 --> 38:23.759
[Kiesha sobbing]

38:23.801 --> 38:25.845
[Nina] It's all
gonna be okay now.

38:27.596 --> 38:31.392
I want you to know
no matter what you decide--

38:31.434 --> 38:34.937
no matter what you decide,
we will always be here for you.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.439
Here for what?

38:41.694 --> 38:43.362
I'm pregnant.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.034
With that crazy man's baby?

38:49.201 --> 38:50.161
You're not keeping it, right?

38:50.202 --> 38:51.454
Kevin, that's enough.

38:51.495 --> 38:52.580
You can't.

38:52.621 --> 38:53.998
It's not your decision.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.584
tense music

39:02.715 --> 39:04.425
[sighs]

39:07.553 --> 39:11.724
bright music

39:11.766 --> 39:13.851
I didn't know you could cook.

39:15.561 --> 39:17.813
I've been taking care of myself
since I was your age.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.982
Of course I can cook.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.653
What does manslaughter mean?

39:31.535 --> 39:34.246
It means you killed someone
but it wasn't your fault.

39:36.415 --> 39:38.376
Who'd you kill?

39:38.417 --> 39:40.669
My dad.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.254
Why?

39:44.006 --> 39:46.384
Because he was
trying to kill me.

39:47.676 --> 39:50.096
Why'd he try to kill you?

39:50.137 --> 39:54.016
Because he wanted a son.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.893
I know what you are.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.562
And what's that?

39:58.604 --> 40:00.231
You were born one way

40:00.272 --> 40:03.984
but inside you felt
you were someone else.

40:04.026 --> 40:05.736
Yeah, that's right.

40:10.741 --> 40:11.909
How do you feel about that?

40:11.951 --> 40:13.911
About what?

40:13.953 --> 40:16.747
About me being trans?

40:16.789 --> 40:18.374
I don't give a fuck.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.668
Really, it doesn't bother you?

40:20.709 --> 40:24.672
Nah, I read about it in school,
and it's not that big a deal.

40:25.089 --> 40:28.259
It's not like you bad
or nothing.

40:28.300 --> 40:30.428
I like this
expensive-ass school.

40:30.469 --> 40:32.012
[chuckles]

40:34.306 --> 40:36.684
You think y'all can afford
to keep me in there?

40:38.269 --> 40:39.937
We'll figure something out.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.773
gentle music

41:02.042 --> 41:03.794
[distant sirens]

41:34.158 --> 41:36.285
Did you do it?

41:37.870 --> 41:42.166
No one is more imperfect
than a man of God.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.836
What did you do with that money
Miss Camille gave you?

41:45.878 --> 41:47.671
I used it to help people.

41:47.713 --> 41:50.132
Did you use it
to help yourself too?

41:50.174 --> 41:52.051
I used it to help us.

41:52.092 --> 41:54.345
We don't need that much.

41:54.386 --> 41:57.348
I wanna give you the world.

41:57.389 --> 41:59.141
You and your mama
deserve that.

41:59.183 --> 42:02.269
We don't want the world, Dad.

42:03.604 --> 42:05.564
We just want you.

42:07.983 --> 42:11.362
I'm not a bad man, son.

42:11.403 --> 42:13.572
Just an ambitious one.

42:15.741 --> 42:17.701
What kinda man will I be?

42:19.870 --> 42:21.789
A better one than me.

42:21.830 --> 42:24.542
gentle music

42:32.049 --> 42:33.884
Where you going?

42:33.926 --> 42:35.386
To watch TV.

42:35.427 --> 42:37.555
If I cook,
you handle the dishes.

42:37.596 --> 42:39.223
Can I do it
before I go to bed?

42:39.265 --> 42:41.350
You can do 'em right now.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.852
[sighs] So that's what
this about to be?

42:43.894 --> 42:44.853
[Imani]
What do you mean?

42:44.895 --> 42:46.355
You bossing me around
and shit?

42:46.397 --> 42:49.400
First of all,
watch your mouth.

42:49.441 --> 42:52.027
Second of all, I ain't
trying to be your mama.

42:52.069 --> 42:53.529
So why you giving me orders?

42:53.571 --> 42:55.573
'Cause I'm here
to teach you responsibility.

42:55.614 --> 42:57.241
I'm responsible.

42:59.493 --> 43:01.370
Sometimes
I can be responsible.

43:03.956 --> 43:06.959
If we're gonna be a family,
we have to act like one.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.378
I ain't here to cook
and clean up after your ass.

43:12.214 --> 43:15.259
Look, I had a shitty stepmom.

43:15.301 --> 43:17.720
I know what that's like.

43:17.761 --> 43:19.930
I ain't trying
to repeat the cycle.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.350
But you will respect me.

43:24.810 --> 43:27.438
I know you think you're grown,
but you ain't.

43:37.656 --> 43:39.617
Thank you.

43:49.209 --> 43:51.462
- Hey.
- Hi.

43:52.838 --> 43:54.798
What took you so long?

43:54.840 --> 43:57.760
I got a lot of shit
going on.

43:57.801 --> 43:59.803
I know that.

44:01.305 --> 44:04.058
Did you wanna talk about it?

44:04.099 --> 44:07.436
Nah.
It's a lot, okay?

44:07.478 --> 44:10.105
So you just gonna
hold it all in?

44:10.147 --> 44:12.024
Yep.

44:12.066 --> 44:14.818
I used to do that too,

44:14.860 --> 44:19.198
and it worked for me
until I tried to kill myself.

44:21.825 --> 44:23.452
You-you serious?

44:23.494 --> 44:26.330
Why would I lie
about something like that?

44:26.372 --> 44:28.415
I'm sorry, I-I didn't know.

44:28.457 --> 44:30.834
Nobody knew,
except my parents

44:30.876 --> 44:33.337
and my therapist.

44:33.379 --> 44:35.798
Hm, I didn't know
you had a therapist.

44:35.839 --> 44:38.676
That's not the kinda thing
you just tell folks right away.

44:42.054 --> 44:45.015
I used to have therapy too.

44:45.057 --> 44:47.935
Maybe you should go back.

44:47.976 --> 44:50.229
Maybe.

44:51.897 --> 44:53.649
You like your therapist?

44:53.691 --> 44:56.402
He's an older, gay black man
with a third eye.

44:56.443 --> 44:58.362
What's not to love?
[chuckles]

44:58.404 --> 45:00.489
- Sounds interesting.
- He is.

45:02.116 --> 45:05.661
I, um, I told him I wanted
you to be my first.

45:07.037 --> 45:08.414
What'd he say?

45:08.455 --> 45:10.916
"Make sure you're sure."

45:10.958 --> 45:12.710
Are you?

45:12.751 --> 45:14.920
Yeah.

45:14.962 --> 45:17.673
smooth jazz music

45:34.523 --> 45:36.567
Was it supposed
to be that fast?

45:36.608 --> 45:39.027
According to Google,
that's perfectly normal.

45:39.069 --> 45:42.197
Besides, I wasn't expecting us
to go five rounds anyway.

45:42.239 --> 45:43.741
So it isn't?

45:43.782 --> 45:47.578
No, that's just what porno
tries to tell you.

45:47.619 --> 45:49.913
Wow, it looks so real.

45:49.955 --> 45:51.915
[chuckles]

45:51.957 --> 45:54.251
So...

45:54.293 --> 45:57.212
what you doing tomorrow?

45:57.254 --> 45:59.798
The people that feel

45:59.840 --> 46:04.762
Like home

46:04.803 --> 46:06.430
Yeah...

46:06.472 --> 46:07.806
It's normal to be scared,
right?

46:07.848 --> 46:09.850
I just wanna
love somebody...

46:09.892 --> 46:11.602
Honestly, I don't know.

46:11.643 --> 46:14.104
I never been married before.

46:14.146 --> 46:16.607
My soul needs that

46:16.648 --> 46:19.276
My soul needs that...

46:19.318 --> 46:20.611
[chuckles]

46:20.652 --> 46:25.240
I just wanna
love somebody...

46:25.282 --> 46:28.160
[exhales deeply]

46:28.202 --> 46:32.247
Any words of wisdom?

46:32.289 --> 46:35.417
Just remember to act
in her absence

46:35.459 --> 46:37.961
as you would in her presence.

46:38.003 --> 46:41.799
Okay?

46:41.840 --> 46:43.133
Come here.

46:43.175 --> 46:44.802
Yeah...

46:44.843 --> 46:47.721
- I love you.
- I love you too.

46:47.763 --> 46:50.307
[chuckles]

46:50.349 --> 46:52.392
- Hey, what up, playa?
- Yo.

46:52.434 --> 46:54.311
- Hi.
- [indistinct]

46:54.353 --> 46:55.979
Hi, hi.
How you doing?

46:56.021 --> 46:58.398
I just wanna
love somebody...

46:58.440 --> 47:00.317
- Whoo!
- You ready?

47:00.359 --> 47:02.736
[groans softly]
All right.

47:02.778 --> 47:04.071
[sports announcer]  Davis
quickly takes it up the court.

47:04.112 --> 47:06.073
- [knocking at door]
- Feeds it over to Roth.

47:06.114 --> 47:07.866
Roth steps up.

47:07.908 --> 47:10.494
And it's good.

47:10.536 --> 47:13.622
[announcer continues
indistinctly]

47:25.968 --> 47:28.804
uneasy music

47:36.520 --> 47:39.189
Congratulations.

47:39.231 --> 47:41.692
You too.

47:41.733 --> 47:44.027
You win some, you lose some.

47:44.069 --> 47:46.697
Hm, I guess so.

47:46.738 --> 47:48.866
I hope you know that I don't
have any hard feelings.

47:48.907 --> 47:51.535
I do.

47:51.577 --> 47:54.204
You tried to kill me.

47:54.246 --> 47:56.540
Nigga, if I wanted
to kill you,

47:56.582 --> 47:58.750
you'd be dead.

48:02.546 --> 48:03.881
You know,
if it's all right with you,

48:03.922 --> 48:05.424
I would like to continue
to pay for Jake's education.

48:05.465 --> 48:06.675
I don't want your money.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.760
No, no, this wouldn't
be a handout.

48:08.802 --> 48:11.555
You would have to earn it.

48:11.597 --> 48:13.473
What you talking about?

48:13.515 --> 48:16.143
Well, now that I have
this new job,

48:16.184 --> 48:18.562
I need somebody who can handle
my business on the street.

48:20.689 --> 48:23.066
And who better than
a street nigga like you?

48:23.108 --> 48:26.194
Yeah well, nigga, I ain't
about that life no more.

48:26.236 --> 48:28.739
I'm trying to
stay in the house.

48:30.616 --> 48:32.117
I figured you might say that.

48:32.159 --> 48:35.203
Then why'd you waste your time
coming over here?

48:35.245 --> 48:38.749
I skipped the custody hearing
on purpose.

48:41.084 --> 48:43.170
Is that right?

48:43.211 --> 48:45.589
If I woulda been there, ain't
no judge in their right mind

48:45.631 --> 48:47.758
woulda handed you custody.

48:49.968 --> 48:52.095
Listen.

48:53.472 --> 48:55.849
This is a great
opportunity for you.

48:56.934 --> 48:59.770
Okay, you can make
some real money.

48:59.811 --> 49:02.773
I can teach you how to lead

49:02.814 --> 49:05.692
and I can teach you the game.

49:05.734 --> 49:07.194
I ain't trying
to go back to jail.

49:07.235 --> 49:09.154
No, the cops won't bother you.

49:09.196 --> 49:11.073
I'm going to change out
the chief of police

49:11.114 --> 49:13.116
for my head of security,

49:13.158 --> 49:15.786
and he'll make sure
you have everything you need.

49:26.463 --> 49:28.882
[exhales sharply]

49:28.924 --> 49:30.175
Okay.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.772
[laughs]

49:47.901 --> 49:49.945
Hey, Trig.

49:53.198 --> 49:56.535

motherfucker.

50:04.042 --> 50:06.336
[door closes]

50:10.549 --> 50:13.844
Speak now or
forever hold your peace.

50:19.182 --> 50:21.685

50:31.695 --> 50:32.904
Hell yeah.

50:32.946 --> 50:34.865
[chuckles]

50:39.077 --> 50:41.913

50:41.955 --> 50:43.582

50:43.623 --> 50:45.000

50:52.716 --> 50:54.384
Yes, I do.

51:03.435 --> 51:05.020
[vocalizing]

51:05.062 --> 51:07.898
By the powers vested in me
by the state of Illinois,

51:07.939 --> 51:11.401
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

51:11.443 --> 51:13.070
You may kiss the bride.

51:13.111 --> 51:15.739

51:31.797 --> 51:34.591
On my way to Bootsy Bellows

51:34.633 --> 51:37.260
Try and think what I'ma
tell 'em when they get alone

51:37.302 --> 51:39.471
I'm a glutton for women
I shouldn't yearn for

51:39.513 --> 51:41.640
Shouldn't be tempted
but baby I like to hurt

51:41.681 --> 51:42.974
Or maybe
'cause I was searching

51:43.016 --> 51:44.267
I found me
the perfect person

51:44.309 --> 51:45.769
But me and her
didn't work out

51:45.811 --> 51:47.270
She buried
what she worked for

51:47.312 --> 51:49.397
And I carried the bitterness
of a kola nut

51:49.439 --> 51:51.775
Nigerian shit, my parents
never showed much

51:51.817 --> 51:54.569
Womanizer, probably
could've been a feminist

51:54.611 --> 51:56.780
'Cause I respect 'em but
Lord I got polygamy problems

51:56.822 --> 51:58.156

51:58.198 --> 51:59.950
Spendin' money

think that you care to buy

52:01.660 --> 52:04.121
