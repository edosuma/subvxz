00:38.748 --> 00:40.165
What're we looking at?

00:40.165 --> 00:41.584
That.

00:41.584 --> 00:44.253
Is that a hornet's nest?
Yeah.

00:44.253 --> 00:47.256
I've never see one up close.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.218
What are you nuts???

00:51.218 --> 00:54.221
Ah, don't be a weenie, it's
been up there for months.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.140
It's empty.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.725
What're you doin'?

00:57.725 --> 01:00.519
I'm trying to knock
down that hornet's nest.

01:00.519 --> 01:01.813
Oh yeah?

01:01.813 --> 01:03.188
That's a big...

01:03.188 --> 01:04.028
WHAT???

01:05.817 --> 01:08.527
Just... stop, alright?

01:08.527 --> 01:10.154
Stop what?

01:10.154 --> 01:12.406
Hey, isn't that a...?

01:17.453 --> 01:19.747
I...I warned you man!

01:19.747 --> 01:21.123
Chickens!

01:21.123 --> 01:23.793
Nothing's gonna happen!

01:37.056 --> 01:40.059
You better not have
that thing with you!

01:40.059 --> 01:41.811
What if I did?
-I'd make you SIT on it!

01:41.811 --> 01:45.272
You're just scared...
Quinn! You got a story?

01:45.272 --> 01:48.442
Yeah, I got a story.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.447
It's about messin' with things
that shouldn't be messed with.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.699
Like a hornet's nest?

01:54.699 --> 01:56.367
Worse.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.619
Like...
life and death.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.372
Sometimes things are the
way they are for a reason.

02:01.372 --> 02:04.208
And if you try to change
that, you're gonna get burned.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.878
If there's one thing the
people in my story learned,

02:06.878 --> 02:09.588
it's that if you go
lookin' for trouble,

02:09.588 --> 02:12.550
chances are...
you're gonna find it.

02:16.721 --> 02:19.807
Submitted for the approval
of The Midnight Society,

02:19.807 --> 02:22.810
I call this story...

02:43.205 --> 02:45.457
Mr. Doyle!
Just in time!

02:45.457 --> 02:48.293
What do you think?

02:48.293 --> 02:51.255
Mr. Doyle?
-What?

02:51.255 --> 02:54.425
Oh, Julie, I'm sorry.

02:54.425 --> 02:56.094
My mind is somewhere else.

02:56.094 --> 02:58.262
Any problems?

02:58.262 --> 02:59.513
Yeah, actually.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.848
Well, good, good, good.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.558
I'm gonna be in my workshop.

03:02.558 --> 03:05.436
Don't disturb me, alright?

03:05.436 --> 03:09.774
Well, what happened to
these plants they're...

03:12.484 --> 03:13.734
dead.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.620
Are you sure she's
even working today?

04:04.620 --> 04:07.331
My sister works here every day.

04:14.880 --> 04:15.720
Julie!?

04:18.050 --> 04:20.427
You here?!?

04:28.811 --> 04:31.022
Ah...
Yuck.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.443
Julie?

[alarm buzzes]

05:37.213 --> 05:38.505
Peter!

05:38.505 --> 05:40.966
You'll never
believe what I just saw!

05:40.966 --> 05:42.760
Oh.
Hi Jake.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.760
Hey.

05:45.054 --> 05:46.889
What did you see?

05:46.889 --> 05:48.182
Oh, right!

05:48.182 --> 05:49.600
Downstairs, in Mr. Doyle's
workshop.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.143
He took blue stuff

05:51.143 --> 05:52.728
and dripped it on his
plant and it started

05:52.728 --> 05:54.688
coming back to life and
moving around like a

05:54.688 --> 05:57.733
spider monster or something!
It was unbelievable!

06:01.570 --> 06:04.282
Oh! Huh... okay I get it.
You do?

06:04.282 --> 06:07.409
Yeah!
April Fools, right?

06:07.409 --> 06:09.203
No!
No I ...

06:09.203 --> 06:10.955
That's the weakest April
Fools Joke I've ever heard.

06:10.955 --> 06:12.623
It's so lame I thought
there's no way

06:12.623 --> 06:14.208
that could be an
April Fool's joke.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.418
That's how bad it was.
-It's no joke...

06:16.418 --> 06:18.045
Nice try, Jules.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.047
Yeah, anyway, Mom and Dad are
going out. Pizza, alright?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.299
Yeah, sure.

06:21.299 --> 06:22.925
Extra cheese, half
pepperoni, half...

06:22.925 --> 06:26.137
spider monster plants.

06:26.137 --> 06:29.640
See you later.

06:31.725 --> 06:32.445
Peter!

06:34.645 --> 06:35.365
PETER!

07:25.404 --> 07:27.114
[tapping]

07:27.114 --> 07:30.909
We're closed!

07:30.909 --> 07:32.870
[tapping, banging]

07:32.870 --> 07:37.666
Mr. Doyle, there's
somebody at the door.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.962
Mr. Doyle?

08:06.195 --> 08:07.155
AHHHHHH!

08:10.824 --> 08:12.117
AHHHHHH!

08:12.117 --> 08:14.245
Don't hurt me!
Please don't...

08:14.245 --> 08:16.163
Ah!
Leave me alone!

08:16.163 --> 08:17.456
Leave me alone!

08:17.456 --> 08:19.583
AHHHHHH!

08:21.419 --> 08:23.795
April Fools!

08:23.795 --> 08:26.257
Hahhahha!

08:26.257 --> 08:28.926
I'm sorry Jules,
he made me do it.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.302
You creeps!

08:30.302 --> 08:32.011
Hey, just getting you back.
For what?

08:32.011 --> 08:34.432
For trying to fool us with
that monster plant story.

08:34.432 --> 08:36.267
You're gonna do April Fools?
Do it right.

08:36.267 --> 08:38.059
It's not a joke!
I'll show you.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.812
Would you just give it up,
you're way out of your league.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.398
C'mon Jake.

08:42.398 --> 08:45.025
Look just, huh,
let it go alright?

08:45.025 --> 08:47.694
We were joking around.
But I can prove it!

08:47.694 --> 08:51.031
And you ruined my Bonsai tree!!!

09:06.630 --> 09:08.090
Mr. Doyle?

09:21.437 --> 09:23.897
Mrs. Doyle.

09:40.038 --> 09:43.041
[door slams upstairs]

09:57.097 --> 09:59.391
And why didn't you tell
me you were interested

09:59.391 --> 10:01.601
in my experiments?

10:01.601 --> 10:04.188
Well, you've been
kinda - I mean,

10:04.188 --> 10:06.648
things have been kinda...
weird.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.484
And the motion-detector...

10:08.484 --> 10:10.027
C'mon.

10:10.027 --> 10:13.697
If you're that
interested, I'll show you.

10:13.697 --> 10:16.534
I know the rigged
door is a little much,

10:16.534 --> 10:18.536
but you see I don't
want my competitors

10:18.536 --> 10:20.287
knowing what I'm up to.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.913
I'm really embarrassed.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.541
Don't be.

10:23.541 --> 10:25.334
All you had to do was ask.

10:25.334 --> 10:28.086
Okay...
what are you doing down here?

10:28.086 --> 10:29.754
An experiment.

10:29.754 --> 10:33.217
You could call it kind
of a super fertilizer.

10:33.217 --> 10:36.345
Just watch.

10:38.930 --> 10:42.267
You see when the chemical
touches the dead cells,

10:42.267 --> 10:46.021
it stimulates the
nuclei to create DNA.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.439
It's...
coming back to life!

10:47.439 --> 10:49.649
Yes it's reanimating.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.193
Un-real!

10:51.193 --> 10:53.404
Now look at that.

10:53.404 --> 10:57.115
It's like it knows
what's helping it regenerate.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.336
What's the gooey stuff?

11:09.336 --> 11:12.130
Hum? Oh!
That's a harmless by-product.

11:20.805 --> 11:24.226
If...If you can
reanimate plants,

11:24.226 --> 11:27.062
can you reanimate
other things?

11:30.649 --> 11:32.025
It's late.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.153
Time to go.

11:44.246 --> 11:47.207
I'll see you after
school tomorrow?

11:47.207 --> 11:53.004
Right... after school
tomorrow. G'night!

12:12.441 --> 12:15.486
Peter please be home.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.657
Peter!
It's me.

12:19.657 --> 12:21.325
You gotta come back to the shop.

12:21.325 --> 12:23.577
I know, but it's that
stuff I told you about,

12:23.577 --> 12:24.995
it works, it's real!

12:24.995 --> 12:27.539
It brings stuff
back from the dead!

12:27.539 --> 12:29.500
And I think...

12:29.500 --> 12:32.252
I think Mr. Doyle's gonna
try and use it on his wife.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.172
Cuz she died last year.

12:48.352 --> 12:51.605
I'm only goin' along with this
cuz I cut up your little tree.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.398
I'm telling you,
he's got this like...

12:53.398 --> 12:55.025
shrine to his wife.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.569
She died?
About a year ago.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.822
And that stuff I told you
about, it regenerates DNA.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.907
I'm telling you,
he's gonna do it!

13:02.907 --> 13:05.118
He's gonna bring his
wife back from the dead!

13:05.118 --> 13:06.995
Huh, okay.

13:06.995 --> 13:10.123
So, where's the punch line?

13:18.716 --> 13:20.133
See!?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.010
How'd you get him
to play along...?

13:22.010 --> 13:23.260
Shhh!

13:30.894 --> 13:33.522
So much for your
April Fools gag.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.357
It's not a gag!

13:35.357 --> 13:36.650
This stuff really works!

13:36.650 --> 13:39.027
It brings stuff
back from the dead!

13:39.027 --> 13:41.029
Okay, let's wake
somebody up then!

13:41.029 --> 13:43.198
Nooo!
Peter stop it!

13:43.198 --> 13:45.867
"In loving memory."?
Nah!

13:45.867 --> 13:48.412
"Rest in peace."
Nah!

13:48.412 --> 13:50.414
Peter stop!
I'm serious!

13:50.414 --> 13:51.707
C'mon Pete, this isn't cool.

13:51.707 --> 13:53.625
"May he be forgiven"?

13:53.625 --> 13:55.502
Sounds like a bad dude.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.337
Don't!
Rise and shine!

13:57.337 --> 14:00.340
Stop it. Enough with this
April Fools stuff, alright?

14:00.340 --> 14:03.719
It's getting too weird.

14:03.719 --> 14:07.138
Well, she started it!

14:22.237 --> 14:23.988
Nothing's gonna happen.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.949
It only works on plants.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.367
There's no proof that...

14:27.367 --> 14:28.447
[tapping]

14:33.791 --> 14:34.511
Peter?

14:39.463 --> 14:40.303
Peter??

14:41.965 --> 14:43.216
What?

14:43.216 --> 14:47.846
Is... is...
is Jake outside?

14:47.846 --> 14:50.307
What's a matter?

14:50.307 --> 14:52.934
There's, there's
something outside the window.

14:52.934 --> 14:55.479
[tapping]

15:13.413 --> 15:14.832
This is getting old.

15:14.832 --> 15:18.918
Call us when the
Pizza gets here.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.129
Jake, I'm not
April foolin' around.

15:21.129 --> 15:24.007
Sure Jules.

15:46.196 --> 15:49.240
Hey?
Pizza guy?

15:56.623 --> 15:59.250
Okay, April Foo...

15:59.250 --> 16:00.090
AHHHHH!

16:02.504 --> 16:04.715
Peter!!! Jake!!!

16:04.715 --> 16:08.426
Ah, about time it got
here, I'm starving.

16:08.426 --> 16:12.514
No!
Don't open it!

16:15.684 --> 16:18.687
Where is he?

16:18.687 --> 16:20.397
No, don't go out there!

16:20.397 --> 16:22.023
Hello!

16:22.023 --> 16:24.693
Pizza dude?

16:24.693 --> 16:26.820
It's not the pizza guy.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.781
It's the guy from the grave
that you poured that stuff on.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.366
Would you a gimme a break!

16:31.366 --> 16:33.243
I don't think
she's kidding.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.746
I'M NOT! WOULD YOU
GUYS LISTEN TO ME!

16:35.746 --> 16:37.581
THIS IS NOT AN APRIL FOOLS JOKE!

16:40.918 --> 16:44.254
Don't YOU start too!
I'm not falling for it.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.714
Peter...she's not kidding.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.091
What now?
I'll just turn around and see...

16:48.091 --> 16:49.051
AHHHHHH!

16:57.768 --> 17:00.687
Oh man.
Oh man oh man!

17:00.687 --> 17:03.356
You didn't tell me this
stuff actually worked!

17:03.356 --> 17:05.442
Yeah, yeah, she did.
Yeah, but...

17:05.442 --> 17:07.359
yeah but this is an
April Fools joke!

17:07.359 --> 17:10.696
You keep telling yourself that,
and in the meantime there's a

17:10.696 --> 17:12.240
zombie on the loose.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.657
"May he be forgiven".

17:13.657 --> 17:15.285
And he's a bad Zombie too.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.328
So what are we
gonna do we do?

17:17.328 --> 17:20.665
Mr. Doyle!
He'll know...

17:20.665 --> 17:23.251
What IS that?

17:24.962 --> 17:27.297
It's the gooh that...

17:28.006 --> 17:28.726
Ahhhh!

17:30.467 --> 17:31.187
Ahhhh!

17:33.177 --> 17:33.897
Ahhhh!

17:35.806 --> 17:38.016
It wants the liquid!

17:38.016 --> 17:39.350
It's what's keeping him alive!

17:39.350 --> 17:41.645
So give it to him!
No!

17:41.645 --> 17:43.187
Okay, okay!
Slow down, slow down!

17:43.187 --> 17:45.189
It's not coming.
She's right you know.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.192
We can't just give it the
stuff, we gotta stop it.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.779
So let's find your boss then.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.113
Water.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.406
Yeah, so?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.325
That's how Mr. Doyle
killed the plant.

17:55.325 --> 17:56.701
He poured water on it!

17:56.701 --> 17:58.244
Cold water, from the freezer.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.163
Alright, so all we gotta
do is get the Zombie

18:00.163 --> 18:02.040
to step in this puddle.
Right?

18:02.040 --> 18:04.793
I think we need a little
bit more water than that.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.670
Is there a hose at Mr. Doyle's?

18:06.670 --> 18:08.005
Yeah!

18:08.005 --> 18:09.339
And it's freezing cold out here.

18:09.339 --> 18:12.258
Okay c'mon!

18:17.931 --> 18:19.182
Okay, where's the faucet?

18:19.182 --> 18:20.433
On the side.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.020
Alright, I got it.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.022
What if dead-boy doesn't come?

18:25.022 --> 18:27.231
He'll come, alright.

18:38.159 --> 18:41.788
Come... and... get it.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.456
A little water please!?!

18:43.456 --> 18:46.334
I'm trying!

18:48.336 --> 18:52.590
Maybe it doesn't
know where we are.

18:52.590 --> 18:53.670
It knows.

18:57.971 --> 19:01.307
This is what you want, isn't it?

19:01.307 --> 19:03.060
OKAY YOU'RE ON!

19:03.060 --> 19:05.436
NO WE'RE NOT!

19:05.436 --> 19:08.356
HUH, HANG ON!

19:09.900 --> 19:11.985
COME ON MAN!

19:11.985 --> 19:15.697
OKAY YOU GOT IT!

19:30.837 --> 19:32.589
Pff...
What took you so long???

19:32.589 --> 19:35.926
Easy man!
We got him, didn't we?

19:40.346 --> 19:42.265
Aaahhh!

19:42.265 --> 19:43.515
Ahhh!

19:45.435 --> 19:48.021
Why didn't it work?
I don't know!

19:48.021 --> 19:52.943
All he did was take some
cold water from the freezer.

19:52.943 --> 19:55.361
He went inside...

19:55.361 --> 19:57.238
Took out some ice cold water...

19:57.238 --> 19:58.698
Uh, Julie?

19:58.698 --> 20:00.742
You ever look in here?

20:09.459 --> 20:12.921
Hot!
It's a hotbox!

20:12.921 --> 20:16.133
It wasn't cold water, it was hot
water that killed the chemicals!

20:16.133 --> 20:18.718
Great. So all we have do is wait
around till next summer...

20:18.718 --> 20:19.438
[bang]

20:24.015 --> 20:25.976
Someone needs to
hide inside the hotbox.

20:25.976 --> 20:27.644
I'll do that!

20:27.644 --> 20:30.063
As soon as the Zombie comes
in here, lure him inside.

20:30.063 --> 20:33.108
Jake and I'll hide and
close the door behind you.

20:33.108 --> 20:35.026
WHAT???
WITH ME INSIDE???

20:35.026 --> 20:36.527
The heat should stop him.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.989
Should???

20:40.406 --> 20:43.868
No!
Watch out for the laser beam!

20:43.868 --> 20:46.663
Peter!
Lead it into the hotbox!

20:53.628 --> 20:56.047
Pete!
The Hotbox!!!!

21:03.888 --> 21:04.728
Ahhhhh!

21:48.641 --> 21:51.936
What's going on?!

22:03.573 --> 22:06.784
I think I'm gonna puke.

22:17.170 --> 22:17.890
Oh no!

22:24.135 --> 22:26.054
What have I done?

22:26.054 --> 22:29.015
I'm sorry Mr.
Doyle, this is my fault.

22:29.015 --> 22:33.603
No.
This is MY fault.

22:33.603 --> 22:37.523
It's wrong to meddle with fate.

22:40.068 --> 22:43.362
This experiment is over.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.953
I gotta tell you,
when I saw that costume,

22:49.953 --> 22:51.162
I thought I was history.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.123
Yeah.
That was pretty cool Jules.

22:53.123 --> 22:54.707
And you know what that means?

22:54.707 --> 22:56.834
What?
I got you last.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.212
April Fools!

23:05.509 --> 23:06.719
The end.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.471
Good one.
-Was good.

23:08.471 --> 23:13.726
I declare this meeting of The
Midnight Society, closed.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.273
I'm gonna get that nest.

23:18.273 --> 23:20.441
Wait.
What's that?

23:20.441 --> 23:21.734
[buzzing]

23:21.734 --> 23:23.361
It's the fire.

23:23.361 --> 23:26.072
No.
It sounds like...

23:26.072 --> 23:28.616
like bees.
The nest!

23:28.616 --> 23:29.826
Mad bees!

23:29.826 --> 23:30.826
RUN!

23:34.914 --> 23:36.207
Wait!

23:36.207 --> 23:40.170
That's where the nest is!

23:42.546 --> 23:47.677
I'm sorry I'm sorry
I'm sorry!
