10:47.848 --> 10:49.683
- WELL, THEY ALL
MODEL THEMSELVES AFTER YOU,

10:49.717 --> 10:51.752
SO WHY NOT GO
WITH THE ORIGINAL, HUH?

10:51.785 --> 10:55.756
[gagging]

10:55.789 --> 10:59.359
- I'M--I'M GOOD AT DISHING UP
HASH BROWNS...

10:59.392 --> 11:01.695
NOT DISHING OUT INTROS.

11:01.729 --> 11:03.697
- DEB, YOU'D BE GREAT.

11:03.731 --> 11:06.233
- YOU'RE BIGGER THAN LIFE.
- WITH AN EVEN BIGGER MOUTH.

11:06.266 --> 11:11.338
- YA MIND NOT INSULTING ME
IN FRONT OF THE...B.F.?

11:11.371 --> 11:14.174
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT MY GIRL.

11:14.207 --> 11:17.177
BIGGER THAN LIFE,
AND A MOUTH TO MATCH.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.781
- I WOULDN'T WANT HER
ANY OTHER WAY.

11:20.814 --> 11:24.351
- YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
IT'S HOT.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.786
- IT'S PRACTICALLY PORN.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.187
- IT WOULD SELL
A BAZILLION COPIES.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.789
- IF IT'S NOT CONFISCATED FIRST.

11:28.822 --> 11:29.957
- WE SHOULD BE SO LUCKY.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.458
THINK OF THE FREE PUBLICITY.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.793
- WORKING FOR BRIAN'S
RUBBED OFF ON YOU

11:32.826 --> 11:34.194
IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.796
I SAY WE GO WITH THIS ONE.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.230
- IT'S COMPLETELY ANTISEPTIC.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.199
- IT ESTABLISHES
OUR NEW VILLAIN, ICE TINA.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.468
IT--IT PLACES OUR HERO
IN JEOPARDY.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.470
- YEAH, THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE A GAY COMIC.

11:43.503 --> 11:46.807
UNAPOLOGETIC, DARING, SEXUAL,
IN YOUR FUCKING FACE.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.208
- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BEING DARING

11:48.241 --> 11:49.810
AND SEX FOR SEX'S SAKE.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.411
- IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK
THIS IS?

11:51.444 --> 11:56.083
J.T. GIVING RAGE A BLOW JOB
ISN'T JUST ABOUT SEX.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.118
IT'S ABOUT THAWING
HIS COLD HEART.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.253
IT'S ABOUT BRINGING HIM
BACK TO LIFE.

12:00.287 --> 12:04.524
IT'S ABOUT THEIR LOVE,
THEIR UNSPOKEN COMMITMENT.

12:04.557 --> 12:08.028
- ART IMITATING LIFE?

12:15.135 --> 12:18.138
- [sighs]
YOU WERE RIGHT.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.308
BRIAN SHOWED ME
HE LOVED ME...

12:21.341 --> 12:25.178
EVERY DAY,
EVEN THOUGH HE NEVER SAID IT.

12:25.212 --> 12:27.114
EVEN THOUGH HE NEVER WILL.

12:27.147 --> 12:30.117
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO HEAR IT.

12:30.150 --> 12:34.287
- WELL, IT'S ALWAYS NICE
TO BE RIGHT.

12:39.359 --> 12:42.229
- THINK IT OVER.

12:50.103 --> 12:53.140
- AFTER 15 YEARS
OF LITERALLY LIVING IN HELL,

12:53.173 --> 12:54.942
SHE FINALLY
LEAVES HER DRUNK,

12:54.975 --> 12:58.145
ABUSIVE, UNEMPLOYED HUSBAND
FOR A WOMAN--IS THIS RIGHT?

12:58.178 --> 12:59.146
- YEAH, JUST STIR IT
INTO THE SAUCE

12:59.179 --> 13:00.147
AND ADD THE WINE. HERE.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.581
- MM, I CAN DO IT.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.184
SO, WHAT DOES THE ASSHOLE
EX-HUSBAND DO?

13:04.217 --> 13:06.186
SUES FOR CUSTODY
OF THEIR THREE KIDS,

13:06.219 --> 13:07.888
AND THE FUCKING JUDGE
ACTUALLY AWARDS IT TO HIM.

13:07.921 --> 13:10.023
WHY?
- BECAUSE A DRUNK, ABUSIVE,

13:10.057 --> 13:11.892
UNEMPLOYED STRAIGHT MALE
MAKES A BETTER PARENT

13:11.925 --> 13:14.227
THAN TWO LESBIANS ANY DAY--
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.462
MAKE SURE THE MEAT
DOESN'T GET TOO DONE.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.898
- I CAN DO IT.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.901
NOW ALL SHE HAS
IS SUPERVISED VISITATION.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.336
SHE'S MISERABLE,
THE KIDS ARE MISERABLE.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.905
- TALK ABOUT UNJUST.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.907
- WHICH IS WHY
I HAVE TO WIN IT.

13:26.940 --> 13:30.543
- YOU HAVE TO WIN IT?

13:34.647 --> 13:37.985
- I KNOW I SAID I'D EASE UP,
AND I HAVE BEEN,

13:38.018 --> 13:39.987
HAVEN'T I?

13:40.020 --> 13:42.389
BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE
A LANDMARK CASE,

13:42.422 --> 13:45.458
WHAT I'VE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS
MY ENTIRE CAREER.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.961
AND IT'S IMPORTANT,
NOT JUST FOR STATE CUSTODY LAW,

13:47.995 --> 13:51.932
BUT FOR THE COMMUNITY,
FOR US, FOR OUR CHILDREN.

13:51.965 --> 13:55.368
- WHAT CAN I SAY AFTER
SUCH AN IMPASSIONED PLEA?

13:55.402 --> 13:57.971
EXCEPT THAT YOU'RE PREGNANT,

13:58.005 --> 14:01.942
AND WE MADE AN AGREEMENT.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.343
- AND I INTEND TO HONOR IT,
I PROMISE.

14:03.376 --> 14:06.079
I JUST HAVE TO BE
EXTRA-SPECIAL CAUTIOUS

14:06.113 --> 14:08.615
ABOUT BUDGETING MY TIME,
THAT'S ALL.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.118
- I--HEY,
IT'S GOING TO BURN!

14:11.151 --> 14:14.621
- I CAN DO IT.

14:14.654 --> 14:17.390
OH, AND CAN YOU DO ME
A HUGE FAVOR

14:17.424 --> 14:20.027
AND TAKE GUS TO DAYCARE
ON YOUR WAY TO WORK TOMORROW?

14:20.060 --> 14:21.661
I HAVE TO MEET THE CLIENT
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.231
BUT DON'T WORRY, I CAN
PICK HIM UP IN THE AFTERNOON.

14:24.264 --> 14:28.235
- WELL, SURE.

14:28.268 --> 14:31.304
- SEE? WHO SAID
YOU CAN'T DO IT ALL?

14:42.049 --> 14:43.984
[cheering, whooping]

14:44.017 --> 14:46.920
*

14:46.954 --> 14:48.121
- SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT.

14:48.155 --> 14:52.425
[indistinct shouts]

14:54.561 --> 14:56.296
OKAY, YOU GOT MY VOTE.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.198
- HEY, I'LL GIVE YOU
AN EXTRA HUNDRED

14:58.231 --> 14:59.399
IF YOU SHOW YOUR COCK.

14:59.432 --> 15:02.335
- YOU GOT IT.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.704
- I-I MEANT UP THERE.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.040
- YOU'RE EVIL.

15:07.074 --> 15:10.143
- I'M SWEET.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.045
- WHOO!

15:12.079 --> 15:14.681
*

15:14.714 --> 15:16.283
- WHAT IS IT ABOUT GAY MEN

15:16.316 --> 15:17.417
THAT THEY'LL INVENT
ANY EXCUSE

15:17.450 --> 15:18.952
JUST TO SHOW THEIR DICKS?

15:18.986 --> 15:20.553
- BECAUSE IT'S FUN?

15:20.587 --> 15:22.455
- OR ELSE THEY FEEL
IT'S ALL THEY HAVE TO SHOW.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.157
- WELL, MR. NOVOTNY,

15:24.191 --> 15:25.558
WHEN DID WE BECOME
SUCH A PRUDE, HUH?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.061
- I'M--I'M NOT A PRUDE.
- OH.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.429
- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY EVERYTHING

15:29.462 --> 15:31.564
HAS TO BE ABOUT SEX.
LIKE...

15:31.598 --> 15:33.466
JUSTIN'S COVER
FOR THE NEXT RAGE

15:33.500 --> 15:37.104
HAS GOT J.T. GIVING BRIAN A--
RAGE--A BLOW JOB.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.738
- INTERESTING SLIP.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.641
AND HOW DOES MICHAEL--I MEAN,
UH, ZEPHYR--FEEL ABOUT THAT?

15:41.674 --> 15:44.111
- HE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT,
AND NEITHER DO I.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.612
- HELLO, BOYS!
- HEY!

15:45.645 --> 15:47.180
- QUITE A TURNOUT.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.182
- YEAH, YOUR MOM CAN REALLY
FILL A VENUE.

15:49.216 --> 15:54.187
- YEAH, SOMEHOW,
I DON'T THINK IT'S MY MOM.

15:54.221 --> 15:58.591
- SO, UH, HOW ARE THINGS...
OTHERWISE?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.527
OTHERWISE,
THINGS ARE GOOD.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.063
*

16:03.096 --> 16:05.232
- I THOUGHT MAYBE, YOU KNOW,
YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD FROM TRACY.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.666
YOU KNOW, ANY SPECIALS
AT THE BIG Q?

16:06.699 --> 16:09.636
HOW'S INVENTORY MOVING?
DID I GET THE JOB?

16:09.669 --> 16:13.073
- ACTUALLY,
I DID SPEAK TO HER.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.741
- WELL, COME, COME ON, COME ON.
THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.509
I MEAN, DID SHE TALK
TO THE DISTRICT MANAGER?

16:16.543 --> 16:18.078
- THIS REALLY ISN'T THE TIME--
- MICHAEL, COME ON.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.746
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS MEANS TO ME.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.115
PLEASE, DON'T PLAY GAMES.
- I'M NOT PLAYING GAMES.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.351
SHIT.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.554
SHE SAID HE HAD SOMEONE ELSE
IN MIND FOR THE JOB.

16:27.587 --> 16:31.158
SOMEONE MORE QUALIFIED.
- MORE QUALIFIED?

16:31.191 --> 16:32.392
SHE SAID I WAS OVERQUALIFIED
AS IT IS.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.161
ARE YOU SURE
THAT WAS THE REASON?

16:34.194 --> 16:37.230
- THAT'S ALL SHE TOLD ME.
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

16:37.264 --> 16:40.433
[cheering, whistling]

16:40.467 --> 16:44.371
*

16:44.404 --> 16:48.575
- OKAY, LET'S GIVE A BIG HAND
FOR JACOB'S BIG FINISH!

16:48.608 --> 16:51.378
[cheers and applause]

16:51.411 --> 16:53.146
HOLY SHIT, HONEY,
IS THAT YOU,

16:53.180 --> 16:55.582
OR IS THAT ONE
OF MY OLD FALSIES?

16:55.615 --> 16:57.784
WAH!
[laughter]

16:57.817 --> 16:59.519
THAT AIN'T NO FOAM RUBBER.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.554
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.524
LET'S SEE IF OUR NEXT CONTESTANT
MEASURES UP.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.694
UH, GET YOUR HANDS OUT
OF YOUR PANTS

17:07.727 --> 17:10.397
AND PUT 'EM TOGETHER
FOR MATTHEW.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.799
[cheers and applause]
- HEY, MATTHEW!

17:12.832 --> 17:15.802
[dance music]

17:15.835 --> 17:20.807

17:20.840 --> 17:25.145
[whoops and catcalls]

17:25.178 --> 17:31.151
*

17:31.184 --> 17:33.320
- * 'CAUSE YOU'RE
TURNING ME ON *

17:33.353 --> 17:35.355
* YOU'RE SINGING MY SONG

17:35.388 --> 17:39.192
* YOU'RE TURNING ME ON
TONIGHT *

17:39.226 --> 17:40.827
* YOU'RE TURNING ME ON

17:40.860 --> 17:42.195

TONIGHT *

17:45.465 --> 17:51.171
*

17:51.204 --> 17:53.573
- EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP!

17:53.606 --> 17:54.774
- PITTSBURGH P.D.!

17:54.807 --> 17:56.376
THIS ESTABLISHMENT
IS NOW CLOSED

17:56.409 --> 18:00.513
FOR VIOLATION OF SECTION 493,
SUBSECTION 10:

18:00.547 --> 18:01.781
LEWD AND IMMORAL BEHAVIOR.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.583

18:03.616 --> 18:05.318
WE'RE--WE'RE JUST STRIPPING

18:05.352 --> 18:06.853

18:08.388 --> 18:10.190
COME ON, LET'S GO.
LET'S GO!

18:10.223 --> 18:11.758
COME ON, LET'S GO.

18:11.791 --> 18:16.129
- PARTY'S OVER, PEOPLE.
OUTSIDE.

18:16.163 --> 18:19.599
YOU HEARD ME.
COME ON, MOVE IT.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.668
QUICK, QUICK, QUICK.
COME ON, LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.336
- WHEN YOU, UH,
TALK TO JEANETTE TODAY,

18:23.370 --> 18:25.672
STRESS HOW IMPORTANT HER
APPEARANCE IN COURT WILL BE.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.340
SEE IF YOU CAN CONVINCE HER
NOT TO...

18:27.374 --> 18:28.541
- LOOK LIKE A LESBIAN?

18:28.575 --> 18:29.909
- I KNOW IT'S NOT P.C.,

18:29.942 --> 18:31.744
BUT IF WEARING A SKIRT
AND EYE SHADOW

18:31.778 --> 18:33.613
IS WHAT IT TAKES
TO GET HER KIDS BACK...

18:33.646 --> 18:35.482
- I'LL MAKE SURE SHE LEAVES HER
LUMBERJACK SHIRT AT HOME.

18:35.515 --> 18:38.151
- JEANETTE ARLEN HAS
TO PUSH YOUR MEETING TO 4:00.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.387
SOMETHING AT WORK.
- OH, FUCK!

18:40.420 --> 18:41.788
FINE, OKAY.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.523
- HEY, IF THERE'S A PROBLEM,
I CAN TAKE OVER.

18:43.556 --> 18:47.427
- NO, NO, I'LL BE THERE.
JUST, UH, GIVE ME A MINUTE.

HEY, BABE.
UH, LISTEN, I'M IN A SPOT.

CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

18:58.271 --> 18:59.539
[cheering]

18:59.572 --> 19:00.707

PEACEFULLY.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.242
WE'RE GONNA BE LOUD,

19:02.275 --> 19:03.576
AND WE'RE GONNA BE ANGRY!

19:03.610 --> 19:04.911
[all cheer]

19:04.944 --> 19:07.580
WHAT'RE WE GONNA BE?
all: LOUD!

19:07.614 --> 19:09.782
- WHAT ELSE ARE WE GONNA BE?
all: ANGRY!

19:09.816 --> 19:11.518
- THAT'S BETTER.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.919
WE'RE GONNA LET
THAT FUCKIN' STOCKWELL KNOW

19:12.952 --> 19:14.721
THAT WE ARE CITIZENS
OF THE UNITED STATES

19:14.754 --> 19:16.256
OF FUCKIN' AMERICA,

19:16.289 --> 19:18.425
AND WE HAVE THE SAME
FUCKIN' FREEDOMS

19:18.458 --> 19:19.559
AS EVERYBODY ELSE.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.827
THE FREEDOM TO--OF SPEECH,

19:20.860 --> 19:22.795
AND THE FREEDOM TO ASSEMBLE,

19:22.829 --> 19:25.965
AND THE FREEDOM TO STRIP.
[whooping]

19:25.998 --> 19:28.401
ALTHOUGH YOU MAY HAVE GONE
A LITTLE TOO FAR, HONEY,

19:28.435 --> 19:29.736
BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT,
IT WAS FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.538
SO EVERYBODY BUNDLE UP,

19:31.571 --> 19:33.440
'CAUSE WE'RE GOING DOWN
TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS.

19:33.473 --> 19:34.941
[cheering]

19:34.974 --> 19:37.544
- WHAT'S ALL THIS?

19:37.577 --> 19:39.679
HALF-PRICE SALE
ON LEMON BARS?

19:39.712 --> 19:42.282
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T THE MAN
BEHIND THE ASSHOLE.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.850
- BRIAN'S ALWAYS
BEHIND THE ASSHOLE.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.286
- DAMN IT, MICHAEL,
THIS IS SERIOUS.

19:46.319 --> 19:49.289
THE ENTIRE FUTURE OF LIBERTY
AVENUE IS BEING THREATENED,

19:49.322 --> 19:51.991
AND YOUR BEST FRIEND HERE
NOT ONLY DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT,

19:52.024 --> 19:54.561
HE'S ALSO HELPING
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

19:54.594 --> 19:55.995
COULD I GET SOME LUNCH?

19:56.028 --> 19:57.630
I-I'M GOING TO BE LATE
FOR MY PRAYER GROUP.

19:57.664 --> 19:58.965
- I'M NOT SERVING TODAY.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.867
I GOT OTHER THINGS TO DO.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.303
AND WHY DON'T YOU DO
THE RIGHT THING FOR ONCE

20:03.336 --> 20:04.771
AND COME WITH US?

20:04.804 --> 20:06.239
- COME ON, MA,
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.974
BRIAN DIDN'T CAUSE THE RAID.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.443
- HA! WHOA, WHOA. I'M SORRY,
MICHAEL, BUT DEBBIE'S RIGHT.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.845
BRIAN HAS PLAYED A BIG PART
IN ENCOURAGING STOCKWELL

20:12.879 --> 20:14.314
TO TARGET THE GAY COMMUNITY.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.982
- STOCKWELL'S NEVER ONCE
MENTIONED THEM.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.984
- US!

20:18.017 --> 20:19.886
- BUT HE HAS IMPLIED IT
IN EVERY WORD HE'S SPOKEN.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.788
- MICHAEL,
WHO'S SIDE ARE YOU ON?

20:21.821 --> 20:24.991
YOUR FRIENDS', YOUR FAMILY'S,
YOUR COMMUNITY'S...

20:25.024 --> 20:27.026
OR HIS?

20:27.059 --> 20:30.630
[service bell rings twice]

20:30.663 --> 20:32.031
- I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

20:32.064 --> 20:33.866
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING
REALLY SUCKS.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.468
- [chuckling]
OH, CHRIST.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.670
NOT YOU TOO.

20:37.704 --> 20:40.006
LOOK, STOCKWELL'S
JUST STIRRING SHIT UP.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.275
AS SOON AS HE'S ELECTED,
THIS'LL ALL BLOW OVER.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.876
THINK IT'S GOING TO BLOW OVER
FOR TED?

20:43.910 --> 20:46.012
- UM, TED FUCKED UP.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.747
THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.
- MA'S RIGHT.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.283
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYBODY
BUT YOURSELF.

20:50.317 --> 20:53.486
- WELL, IF I DON'T, WHO WILL?
YOU KNOW?

20:53.520 --> 20:55.822
STOCKWELL AND HIS SUPPORTERS
ARE MY ONE-WAY TICKET

20:55.855 --> 20:58.525
OUT OF THIS SECOND-RATE,
SECOND-CLASS BURG.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.527
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR
SECOND-RATE FRIENDS?

21:00.560 --> 21:02.028
- I DON'T KNOW,
WHEN I'M ON THE 99TH FLOOR

21:02.061 --> 21:03.663
OF MY NEW OFFICE
IN NEW YORK CITY,

21:03.696 --> 21:05.632
THIS IS ALL GOING TO SEEM
LIKE A DISTANT MEMORY.

21:05.665 --> 21:08.034
- FINE. GO.
TAKE JUSTIN WITH YOU.

21:08.067 --> 21:12.572
- HEY!
YOU DIDN'T LET ME FINISH.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.974
IT'LL ALL SEEM LIKE A DISTANT
MEMORY, EXCEPT FOR YOU...

21:15.007 --> 21:18.411
BECAUSE WHEREVER I GO,
AND WHOEVER I'M WITH,

21:18.445 --> 21:20.680
I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.915
- BULLSHIT.

21:22.949 --> 21:26.719
- IT'S NOT BULLSHIT.

21:32.091 --> 21:35.562
- GRITS WITH CREAM CHEESE,
DEEP-FRIED OKRA,

21:35.595 --> 21:38.798
CATFISH WITH PECAN SAUCE,
COCONUT CUSTARD PIE.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.100
- I THOUGHT I'D GIVE THEM
SOME SOUTHERN COMFORT.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.069
- YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM
A HEART ATTACK.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.405
- WELL...
- [chuckles]

21:45.438 --> 21:48.408
- MORNING, SWEETIE.
- "MORNING"?

21:48.441 --> 21:51.711
- HEY, VIC.
SORRY I SLEPT SO LATE.

21:51.744 --> 21:55.748
- THAT'S OKAY.
YOU NEEDED YOUR REST.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.350
- PLANNING ANOTHER PARTY?

21:57.384 --> 21:59.118
- JUST A SIMPLE,
DOWN-HOME BIRTHDAY.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.654
- AT $50 A HEAD.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.691
- GOOD THING ONE OF US
IS BRINGING HOME THE BACON.

22:04.724 --> 22:07.093
- SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT THE BIG Q.
MICHAEL TOLD ME.

22:07.126 --> 22:09.762
- YEAH, SEEMS MY REPUTATION
PRECEDED ME.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.999
- NOW, NOW.
BETTER THINGS LIE AHEAD.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.034
AFTER ALL, LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
TO VANESSA WILLIAMS.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.570
SHE, UM--SHE LOST HER
MISS AMERICA CROWN

22:17.604 --> 22:19.038
FOR BUMPING BUSHES
IN THAT PHOTO SPREAD,

22:19.071 --> 22:21.441
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP DISNEY
FROM ASKING HER

22:21.474 --> 22:24.711
TO SING THE THEME TO POCAHONTAS,
NOW, DID IT?

22:24.744 --> 22:26.746
WHATCHA MAKIN', BABY?

22:26.779 --> 22:28.448
- BLOODY MARY.
ANYONE WANT ONE?

22:28.481 --> 22:29.849
- NOT FOR ME.

22:29.882 --> 22:33.052
- OH, WE HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE
TO TEND BAR.

22:33.085 --> 22:35.588
BRENT, UH,
HAS TO WORK AT WOODY'S.

22:35.622 --> 22:37.123
- I CAN TEND BAR.
- YOU CAN?

22:37.156 --> 22:39.125
- YEAH, HOW DO YOU THINK
I EARNED EXTRA MONEY

22:39.158 --> 22:40.727
BACK IN COLLEGE?

22:40.760 --> 22:43.996
I TENDED BAR AT ALL
THE AA MEETINGS.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.932
ACCOUNTANTS ASSOCIATION.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.134
- WELL, THAT WOULD BE GREAT,
SWEETIE,

22:48.167 --> 22:49.636
BUT WE CAN'T PAY A LOT.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.471
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

22:51.504 --> 22:52.739
THERE'S NO SHAME IN EARNING
AN HONEST NIGHT'S PAY

22:52.772 --> 22:55.442
FOR AN HONEST NIGHT'S WORK.

22:58.177 --> 23:01.614
- WELL, THEN, YOU BETTER GET OUT
YOUR COCKTAIL SHAKER

23:01.648 --> 23:03.750
AND START SHAKING, MISTER!

23:03.783 --> 23:04.917
- UH-HUH?

23:04.951 --> 23:07.487
- STOCKWELL
IS A FUCKING HOMOPHOBE,

23:07.520 --> 23:08.921
IS WHAT HE IS.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.690
HE'S TRYING TO TURN ALL THE GAYS
INTO SCAPEGOATS,

23:10.723 --> 23:13.159
LIKE THEY DID IN THE PAST
WITH OTHER MINORITIES.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.762
SO WHOEVER THOSE ASSHOLES
ARE WHO SAY THAT

23:15.795 --> 23:18.765
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE...
WELL, IT IS HAPPENING!

23:18.798 --> 23:20.700
IT'S JUST LIKE HITLER
IN WORLD WAR II.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.770
- SO, WHAT'D WE DO
THIS TIME?

23:23.803 --> 23:25.972
- UH, SHUT DOWN A BAR
ON LIBERTY AVENUE.

23:26.005 --> 23:29.676
- AND THE FAIRIES
ARE ALL A'FLUTTER, HUH?

23:29.709 --> 23:32.512
- THERE'S NO REASON
TO CALL PEOPLE NAMES, TOM.

23:32.545 --> 23:34.681
- MAYBE YOU WANT
TO JOIN THEM, HUH?

23:34.714 --> 23:37.183
HEY, ISN'T THAT
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

23:37.216 --> 23:38.651
- IT'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT
THAN WHAT THE--

23:38.685 --> 23:40.720
THE FUCKIN' NAZIS
DID TO THE JEWS!

23:40.753 --> 23:42.722
OR--OR WHAT HAPPENED
TO CICELY TYSON

23:42.755 --> 23:44.524
WHEN SHE TRIED TO TAKE
A SIP OF WATER

23:44.557 --> 23:47.527
OUT OF THAT
DRINKING FOUNTAIN.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.529
- YOU OUGHTA GET HER
A MUZZLE.

23:49.562 --> 23:53.199
- EXCUSE ME.

23:53.232 --> 23:55.602
[angry shouting]

23:55.635 --> 23:57.103
- HOW COULD YOU
LET THIS HAPPEN?

23:57.136 --> 23:58.938
- ME? WHAT DID I
HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

23:58.971 --> 24:00.673
- DON'T TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HE HAD PLANNED.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.575
HE'S YOUR FUCKIN' BOSS,
ISN'T HE?

24:02.609 --> 24:03.876
- I SWEAR,
I DIDN'T KNOW JACK SHIT.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.579
- OH, SAVE IT, CARL...

24:06.613 --> 24:07.947
'CAUSE I'M NOT BUYIN' IT.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.082
all: STOCKWELL CAN GO TO HELL!

24:10.116 --> 24:14.153
STOCKWELL CAN GO TO HELL!
STOCKWELL CAN GO TO HELL!

24:14.186 --> 24:16.122
STOCKWELL CAN GO TO HELL!

24:16.155 --> 24:18.090
- IT WAS THE ONLY TIME
THEY COULD MEET.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.692
- YOU SAID THE COURT DATE
ISN'T FOR MONTHS.

24:19.726 --> 24:21.728
- BUT WE HAVE TO START
BUILDING OUR APPEAL NOW.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.229
WE'VE GOT TO INTERVIEW
THE DEFENDANTS,

24:23.262 --> 24:24.597
LINE UP WITNESSES...

24:24.631 --> 24:25.832
- WHICH OBVIOUSLY
TAKES PRECEDENCE

24:25.865 --> 24:27.266
OVER PICKING YOUR SON UP
FROM DAYCARE.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.001
- I'VE TOLD YOU--
- IT'S A LANDMARK CASE.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.036
YES, SO I'VE HEARD.
- CAN I FINISH?

24:30.069 --> 24:31.571
- YES, GO AHEAD, FINISH.

24:31.604 --> 24:32.972
- THAT HAS DIRECT BEARING
ON OUR LIVES.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.774
WHAT THE COURTS
HAVE BASICALLY SAID

24:34.807 --> 24:36.743
IS THAT A FAMILY
WITH GAY PARENTS

24:36.776 --> 24:39.579
IS LESS THAN A FAMILY
WITH STRAIGHT PARENTS.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.848
SO IT'S ABOUT MORE THAN JUST

24:41.881 --> 24:43.783
JEANETTE ARLEN
AND ANNA SOKOWSKI.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.585
IT'S ABOUT YOU AND ME.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.253
- WELL, IF IT
IS ABOUT YOU AND ME,

24:47.286 --> 24:48.855
MAYBE YOU COULD TRY
SHOWING A LITTLE MORE RESPECT

24:48.888 --> 24:50.623
FOR MY LIFE, MY JOB.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.059
- LOOK, I SAID I WAS SORRY
ABOUT A BILLION TIMES.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.528
I MEAN, WAS--WAS IT THAT BIG
OF AN IMPOSITION?

24:55.562 --> 24:57.597
DID IT CREATE SOME
LIFE-THREATENING CATASTROPHE

24:57.630 --> 24:58.898
AT THE ART GALLERY?
- YOU SEE?

24:58.931 --> 25:00.900
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.736
WHAT I DO COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE
AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT YOU DO.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.638
- WELL, IT'S MY JOB
THAT PAYS FOR THIS MORTGAGE.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.306
IT'S MY SALARY THAT PAYS
FOR GUS' DAYCARE.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.208
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT MONEY,

25:09.241 --> 25:10.743
IT'S ABOUT KEEPING YOUR WORD,
AND WE MADE A DEAL.

25:10.777 --> 25:13.546
- THIS IS THE CASE
OF MY CAREER!

25:13.580 --> 25:15.281
- AND THIS IS THE LAUNDRY,
AND THOSE ARE THE DISHES,

25:15.314 --> 25:17.884
AND THIS IS OUR SON...

25:17.917 --> 25:21.954
WHO NEEDS TO TAKE A BATH.

25:21.988 --> 25:25.157
- LINZ...

25:25.191 --> 25:27.059
LINZ!

25:27.093 --> 25:30.563
I'M NOT YOU...

25:32.699 --> 25:36.302
AND I'M NEVER GOING TO BE
THE KIND OF MOTHER YOU ARE.

25:36.335 --> 25:38.671
- AND WHAT KIND
OF MOTHER'S THAT?

25:38.705 --> 25:40.039
- THE KIND WHO'S WILLING
TO GIVE EVERYTHING UP

25:40.072 --> 25:42.308
TO BE WITH HER KID 24/7.

25:42.341 --> 25:44.343
- WHO ASKED YOU TO BE?

25:44.376 --> 25:46.078
THE AGREEMENT WAS TO SHARE
AND SHARE ALIKE.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.715
BUT THE FIRST TIME
IT INTERFERES WITH YOUR WORK--

25:48.748 --> 25:51.651
- THERE IS A WAY
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO.

25:51.684 --> 25:54.320
- WHAT?
YOU WANT ME TO QUIT MY JOB?

25:54.353 --> 25:56.656
- NO, OF COURSE NOT,

25:56.689 --> 25:58.925
BUT WE COULD GET
A PART-TIME NANNY.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.693
- NO, NO, NO.
I WAS RAISED BY NANNIES,

26:00.727 --> 26:02.128
IN CASE YOU'D FORGOTTEN.

26:02.161 --> 26:04.130
I WILL NOT HAVE GUS
BE RAISED BY SOMEONE ELSE.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.933
- ALL RIGHT,
THEN WE COULD ASK DUSTY

26:06.966 --> 26:09.602
OR ONE OF THE OTHER MOMS
TO PICK GUS UP AFTER SCHOOL

26:09.636 --> 26:13.139
AND KEEP HIM UNTIL ONE OF US
GETS OFF WORK.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.875
- [sighs]
- WELL?

26:18.377 --> 26:20.279
- YOU KNOW, FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S SO INTENT

26:20.312 --> 26:22.248
ON DEFENDING
LESBIAN MOTHERHOOD,

26:22.281 --> 26:25.718
YOU'RE NOT MUCH
OF AN EXAMPLE.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.354
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

26:28.387 --> 26:30.957
STRAIGHT MOTHERS WORK FULL-TIME
AND HAVE NANNIES.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.692
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

26:32.725 --> 26:36.228
- THE DIFFERENCE IS WE HAVE
TO BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.865
I'M SURE YOUR CLIENTS
WOULD AGREE WITH ME.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.369
[door shuts]

26:43.402 --> 26:45.638
[overlapping chatter]

26:45.672 --> 26:46.839
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?

26:46.873 --> 26:49.008
GET THESE
FOR THIS GENTLEMAN HERE.

26:56.148 --> 26:59.385
HERE YOU GO,
DRAGON FRUIT EXTRAVAGANZA.

26:59.418 --> 27:02.188
YOU GUYS GOT YOUR RED WINES.
THERE YOU GO.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.023
RIGHT THERE.
HOPE YOU ENJOY IT.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.425
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD YEAR.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.927
KETEL ONE AND TONIC.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.261
THERE YOU GO.
- CHEERS.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.863
- AND TWO COSMOS
COMING RIGHT UP.

27:10.897 --> 27:14.133
- GREAT, THANK YOU.
- HOW'S IT GOING?

27:14.166 --> 27:16.736
- WELL, NO ONE'S
BEEN POISONED YET.

27:16.769 --> 27:19.438
- [laughs]

27:19.471 --> 27:21.774
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU.

27:21.808 --> 27:24.410
- YOU HAVE?
- MM-HMM.

27:24.443 --> 27:27.747
YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.448
I LIKE THAT IN A MAN.
- MMM.

27:29.481 --> 27:34.153
WELL, THEN WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE ME
MIX A SLOE GIN FIZZ.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.022
- YOU KNOW I LIKE IT SLOW.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.024
[chuckles]

27:38.057 --> 27:41.761
- TWO COSMOS, THERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

27:41.794 --> 27:44.463
- MARTINI, EXTRA DIRTY.

27:44.496 --> 27:48.334
- YES, SIR,
COMING RIGHT UP, SIR!

27:57.376 --> 28:02.181
- I SAID A MARTINI,
EXTRA DIRTY.

28:02.214 --> 28:06.853
- UH, RIGHT.
RIGHT AWAY.

28:24.436 --> 28:27.373
- I KNOW YOU.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.809
YOU'RE, UM...

28:29.842 --> 28:32.011
SCHMIDT.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.080
TED, ISN'T IT?

28:34.113 --> 28:36.348
THE ONE WITH THAT WEB SITE.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.350
- HELLO, GARTH.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.486
- SAW YOUR PICTURE
IN THE PAPER,

28:40.519 --> 28:43.956
AND ON THE NEWS.

28:43.990 --> 28:48.027
WHAT A SHAME.
- YEAH, WELL...

28:48.060 --> 28:51.397
WHAT'RE YOU GOING TO DO?
IT'S...ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.299
- AND NOW?

28:53.332 --> 28:56.969
- [clears throat]
I, UM--

28:57.003 --> 28:59.772
OH, I--MY--MY, UH...

28:59.806 --> 29:02.842
MY BOYFRIEND'S...
THROWING THIS PARTY.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.244
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO...
[stammering]

29:05.277 --> 29:06.879
I'M HELPING HIM--
HELPING HIM OUT.

29:15.487 --> 29:18.891
- I ASKED FOR EXTRA-DIRTY.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.326
OF ALL PEOPLE, I WOULD THINK
THAT YOU'D BE ABLE

29:20.359 --> 29:23.129
TO HANDLE THAT.

29:23.162 --> 29:26.232
- SORRY.

29:34.907 --> 29:36.575
- WHO WAS THAT
YOU WERE TALKING TO?

29:36.608 --> 29:39.311
- NOBODY.

29:50.389 --> 29:53.359
- JUST GOT THE ON-AIR VERSION
OF THE AD WE SHOT.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.027
THOUGHT I'D DROP IT BY.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.562
YOU COME OFF GREAT,

29:56.595 --> 29:59.298
AND YOUR INTERACTION
WITH THE KIDS, IT'S TERRIFIC.

29:59.331 --> 30:01.233
- I'LL LOOK AT IT LATER.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.309
- SOMETHING UP?

30:10.342 --> 30:14.113
- I HAD A POWWOW
WITH MY ADVISORS TODAY.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.115
WE ALL THINK YOU'VE DONE
A GREAT JOB,

30:16.148 --> 30:17.449
BUT AT THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE,

30:17.483 --> 30:20.286
WE FEEL WE NEED TO MOVE
IN A NEW DIRECTION.

30:23.890 --> 30:26.392
- I TURNED YOUR FUCKING
CAMPAIGN AROUND.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.494
- I'M AWARE OF THAT.

30:28.527 --> 30:32.331
- THEN WHY, AT THIS
CRITICAL JUNCTURE,

30:32.364 --> 30:35.301
ARE YOU FIRING ME?

30:37.904 --> 30:42.341
- LET'S JUST SAY WE NO LONGER
BAT FOR THE SAME TEAM.

30:42.374 --> 30:47.146
- WHAT TEAM IS THAT,
THE PITTSBURGH POONCHASERS?

30:47.179 --> 30:48.614
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

30:48.647 --> 30:51.951
- I'M TALKING ABOUT PUSSY,
JIM.

30:51.984 --> 30:54.553
LOOK, DON'T INSULT ME.

30:54.586 --> 30:57.356
ONE OF YOUR POSSE SAW ME
AT WOODY'S LAST NIGHT

30:57.389 --> 30:59.425
AND REPORTED BACK.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.260
- YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.162
- WELL, MY RULE
HAS ALWAYS BEEN

31:03.195 --> 31:05.664
"IF I'M NOT SUCKING
YOUR COCK,

31:05.697 --> 31:08.901
THEN IT'S NONE OF YOUR
FUCKING BUSINESS."

31:08.935 --> 31:11.003
- THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

31:11.037 --> 31:13.973
ANYTHING THAT CAN COST ME
THIS CAMPAIGN

31:14.006 --> 31:17.343
IS MY FUCKING BUSINESS.

31:23.682 --> 31:26.152
[drops tape on desk]

31:36.728 --> 31:39.598
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR DIET?

31:39.631 --> 31:42.334
- FUCK FOUR OUNCES OF KALE
AND THREE OUNCES OF CHICKEN.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.670
- FUCK HORVATH TOO?

31:44.703 --> 31:48.941
- HE'S NO LONGER PART
OF MY WEIGHT-LOSS PROGRAM.

31:48.975 --> 31:51.477
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
I WAS DOING DATING A COP ANYWAY.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.579
- BECAUSE HE ADORED YOU
AND COULD PERFORM CUNNILINGUS

31:53.612 --> 31:55.581
LIKE A THIRSTY LESBIAN.

31:55.614 --> 32:00.019
- GOD!

32:00.052 --> 32:01.487
HOW THE HELL DO YOU KNOW?

32:01.520 --> 32:04.023
- THE WALLS HAVE EARS.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.158
SIS, YOU'RE ASSUMING THINGS.

32:06.192 --> 32:08.027
MAYBE HE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW,

32:08.060 --> 32:09.561
AND IF HE DID,
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

32:09.595 --> 32:12.698
HE WOULDN'T HAVE TRIED
TO PROTECT YOU.

32:12.731 --> 32:15.067
- SINCE WHEN DID YOU START
DEFENDING COPS?

32:15.101 --> 32:19.305
- SINCE YOU FELL FOR ONE.

32:19.338 --> 32:22.708
- SURE DIDN'T TAKE THEM LONG
TO REOPEN.

32:22.741 --> 32:25.244
- I TOLD YOU,
IT'S ALL A GAME.

32:25.277 --> 32:28.080
HE CLOSES THEM DOWN,
THEY PAY A LITTLE FINE.

32:28.114 --> 32:30.449
HE GETS A HIT IN THE PRESS.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.451
YOUR MOM'S THE ONE
WHO HAD TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.053
- SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT GAMES.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.621
SHE TAKES EVERYTHING
TO HEART.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.189
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,

32:37.223 --> 32:39.458
ARE THE PERFECT
POLITICAL ANIMAL.

32:39.491 --> 32:43.095
HAND STEADY, EYES FIXED FIRMLY
ON THE TARGET.

32:43.129 --> 32:46.065
SAY ANYTHING, DO ANYTHING...

32:46.098 --> 32:47.466
- HE CANNED ME.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.201
- HUH?

32:49.235 --> 32:52.471
STOCKWELL.
HE FUCKING CANNED ME.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.340
- FOR WHAT?

32:54.373 --> 32:58.610
- FOR BEING HERE.
ONE OF HIS COPS RECOGNIZED ME.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.347
- TRAPPED IN A WEB
OF YOUR OWN DECEIT,

33:01.380 --> 33:03.615
A VICTIM OF YOUR OWN
MACHINATIONS.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.218
- SAVE THE BAD DIALOGUE
FOR YOUR COMIC BOOK.

33:06.252 --> 33:07.753
- THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
WORKING FOR HETEROS.

33:07.786 --> 33:09.355
YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN
YOUR OWN ADVICE.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.257
WAIT TILL MY MOM FINDS OUT.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.424
THAT'LL CHEER HER UP.

33:12.458 --> 33:17.263
- GLAD TO BE OF ASSISTANCE.

33:18.797 --> 33:21.033
- MA. MA!

33:21.067 --> 33:22.768
- NOT NOW, SWEETIE.

33:22.801 --> 33:25.171
MOTHER'S
TRYING TO CONCENTRATE.

33:25.204 --> 33:28.240
WELL, CONCENTRATE ON THIS--
BRIAN GOT THE AXE.

33:28.274 --> 33:29.508
STOCKWELL FIRED HIM.

33:29.541 --> 33:33.645
- [exhales]
THAT'S NICE.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.414
- NICE?
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE THRILLED.

33:35.447 --> 33:38.550
- IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

33:38.584 --> 33:41.653
STOCKWELL'S STILL GONNA
PICK ON US, AND YOU KNOW WHY?

33:41.687 --> 33:43.689
'CAUSE HE'S A BULLY...

33:43.722 --> 33:45.324
AND WE'RE THE LITTLE GUY.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.193
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU WERE
IN THIRD GRADE AND THAT--

33:47.226 --> 33:49.161
THAT TERRY KID
PICKED ON YOU.

33:49.195 --> 33:52.398
- THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE
A BULLY--THAT'S LIFE.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.800
BUT THIS TIME, WE'RE GOING
TO STAND UP TO HIM.

33:54.833 --> 33:57.136
- STOCKWELL CAN GO TO HELL!

33:57.169 --> 33:59.705
- STOCKWELL IS A [bleep]
HOMOPHOBE IS WHAT HE IS!

33:59.738 --> 34:02.408
HE'S TRYING TO TURN ALL THE GAYS
INTO SCAPEGOATS,

34:02.441 --> 34:04.676
LIKE THEY DID IN THE PAST
WITH OTHER MINORITIES.

34:04.710 --> 34:07.146
SO WHOEVER THOSE [beep] ARE
WHO SAY

34:07.179 --> 34:09.848
THAT IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE--
WELL, IT IS HAPPENING!

34:09.881 --> 34:12.418
[cheers and applause]

34:12.451 --> 34:15.187
- AS MEMBERS OF THE GAY
COMMUNITY EXPRESS OUTRAGE

34:15.221 --> 34:17.723
AND HIS NUMBERS DROP
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE POLLS,

34:17.756 --> 34:20.292
MAYORAL CANDIDATE
POLICE CHIEF JIM STOCKWELL

34:20.326 --> 34:23.429
HAS YET TO RESPOND
TO THE CHARGES OF HOMOPHOBIA.

34:23.462 --> 34:27.233
- HEY, BRIAN!

34:27.266 --> 34:29.735
HOW'S YOUR GUY
GONNA COVER HIS ASS NOW?

34:31.737 --> 34:33.739
I'LL HAVE ANOTHER.

34:37.876 --> 34:41.180
STOCKWELL IS [beep] HOMOPHOBE
IS WHAT HE IS!

34:41.213 --> 34:42.781
HE'S TRYING TO TURN
ALL THE GAYS INTO SCAPEGO--

34:42.814 --> 34:44.450
[TV shuts off]

34:44.483 --> 34:46.718
- [sighs]

34:46.752 --> 34:50.322
- AH, SHE'S GOT A BIG MOUTH.

34:50.356 --> 34:53.259
- THAT RALLY ALSO COST ME
SOME POINTS.

34:53.292 --> 34:56.195
- WELL, I TOLD YOU
ABOUT PICKING ON GUYS

34:56.228 --> 34:57.729
THAT AREN'T YOUR SIZE.

34:57.763 --> 35:01.567
SO OTHER THAN THAT,
HOW'S YOUR DAY GOING?

35:05.237 --> 35:07.606
- JIM JUNIOR
HAS A BASKETBALL GAME.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.741
- IS HIS TEAM STILL AHEAD?

35:09.775 --> 35:12.344
- THEY'RE TIED
FOR THE LEAGUE NOW.

35:12.378 --> 35:16.215
HE NEEDS A WIN TODAY.

35:16.248 --> 35:19.218
- SO DO YOU.

35:19.251 --> 35:20.652
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.221
THAT'S ALL THE PAPER
WE HAVE ON THE GUY.

35:22.254 --> 35:23.522
I SUPPOSE YOU SHOULD CHECK
THE EAST END.

35:23.555 --> 35:26.358
THAT'S HIS OLD, UH--
HIS OLD HOOD.

35:26.392 --> 35:30.896
EXCUSE ME.
- OKAY.

35:30.929 --> 35:33.499
- I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.501
- THAT'S OKAY.
WHAT'S UP?

35:35.534 --> 35:37.569
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

35:42.941 --> 35:47.679
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT, UM...

35:49.548 --> 35:53.219
I'VE COME TO APOLOGIZE.

35:55.754 --> 35:58.390
ANYWAY, UH, WOODY'S
IS REOPENED NOW,

35:58.424 --> 36:01.260
AND--AND THE CONTEST
WAS A FUCKIN' HOOT.

36:01.293 --> 36:02.861
THE KIDS LOVED ME.

36:02.894 --> 36:04.430
YOU SHOULD'VE HEARD SOME
OF THE GOOD CRACKS I GOT OFF.

36:04.463 --> 36:07.666
- I'M SURE.
YOU ALWAYS DO.

36:07.699 --> 36:10.469
- WHAT?

36:10.502 --> 36:13.272
- YOU ALWAYS DO.

36:13.305 --> 36:17.243
YOUR BIG MOUTH HAS GOTTEN ME
INTO SOME DEEP SHIT AROUND HERE.

36:19.245 --> 36:20.946
- I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
MY BIG MOUTH.

36:20.979 --> 36:23.882
- NOT WHEN IT'S YAPPING ON TV,
BLASTING MY BOSS.

36:23.915 --> 36:27.719
- BECAUSE HE'S A GODDAMN
FUCKING NAZI HOMOPHOBE!

36:30.389 --> 36:32.558
- WILL YOU PIPE DOWN?

36:32.591 --> 36:35.361
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN.

36:35.394 --> 36:37.329
CAN'T YOU KEEP
THAT THING SHUT?

36:37.363 --> 36:39.698
- NOT WHEN SOMEONE'S ATTACKING
MY FRIENDS AND MY COMMUNITY.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.567
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
IF HE IS YOUR BOSS.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.868
- WELL, I DO.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.836
SO HE SHUT DOWN A GAY BAR
FOR ONE NIGHT

36:44.870 --> 36:46.738
FOR HAVING AN ILLEGAL
STRIP SHOW.

36:46.772 --> 36:49.508
- YEAH, USING SOME LAW
LEFT OVER FROM DAYS

36:49.541 --> 36:51.343
WHEN INDIANS STRIPPED
FOR SETTLERS.

36:51.377 --> 36:53.879
- STOP TURNING IT INTO
THE GODDAMN INQUISITION.

36:53.912 --> 36:54.980
- HE'S THE ONE DOING
A GREAT JOB OF THAT

36:55.013 --> 36:56.782
WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM ME.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.351
AND YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
HE'S NOT GONNA STOP HERE.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.620
WELL, NEITHER AM I!

37:01.653 --> 37:03.989
AS LONG AS THERE'S STILL
FREEDOM OF SPEECH,

37:04.022 --> 37:06.325
I'M GONNA EXERCISE
MY FUCKIN' RIGHTS

37:06.358 --> 37:08.394
TO SHOOT OFF
MY BIG FUCKIN' MOUTH...

37:08.427 --> 37:10.629
AS LOUD AS I FUCKIN' WANT!

37:10.662 --> 37:14.333
- IF THAT'S YOUR CHOICE.

37:14.366 --> 37:17.503
- IT IS.

37:17.536 --> 37:20.639
- THEN THIS IS MINE.

37:31.049 --> 37:33.885
- I AM STARVING.
- I'M LIKE A BOTTOMLESS PIT.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.387
- I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY...

37:35.421 --> 37:36.755
- IF WE WAIT ANY LONGER,

37:36.788 --> 37:39.358
WE CAN PAVE THE DRIVEWAY
WITH THESE EMPANADAS.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.059
- MMM.
WHERE'S TED?

37:41.092 --> 37:43.395
- HE WENT OUT TO PICK UP
SOME WINE.

37:43.429 --> 37:45.364
- ABOUT FIVE HOURS AGO.

37:45.397 --> 37:47.899
- YOU KNOW HOW FINICKY HE IS
ABOUT CHOOSING THE RIGHT LABEL.

37:47.933 --> 37:52.904
WELL...
I GUESS WE SHOULD START.

37:52.938 --> 37:56.708
SO UH, THANK YOU ALL
FOR BEING OUR TASTERS.

37:56.742 --> 37:59.945
YOU ARE GOOD FRIENDS...
AND GUINEA PIGS.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.713
[laughter]
- IN OTHER WORDS,

38:01.747 --> 38:03.649
BETTER WE CROAK
THAN YOUR RICH CLIENTS.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.050
- EXACTLY.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.653
- WELL, IT MAY BE DEADLY,
BUT IT LOOKS DELICIOUS.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.955
- MMM!
AMAZING.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.923
- HMM.

38:11.957 --> 38:15.093
- WELL, DIG IN,
THERE'S LOTS OF FOOD.

38:15.126 --> 38:19.398
- HAIL! HAIL!
THE GANG'S ALL HERE!

38:19.431 --> 38:21.867
HEY!
all: HEY!

38:21.900 --> 38:23.435
- WHERE YOU BEEN, HONEY?

38:23.469 --> 38:27.072
- MMM, SELECTING
THE PROPER VINTAGE,

38:27.105 --> 38:31.543
WHICH,
GIVEN THE AUSPICIOUSNESS--

38:31.577 --> 38:33.679
IS THAT A WORD?

38:33.712 --> 38:35.080
WELL, IT IS NOW--

38:35.113 --> 38:39.685
OF THIS OCCASION...

38:39.718 --> 38:43.989
REQUIRED SOME PRETTY GODDAMN
EXTENSIVE SAMPLING.

38:44.022 --> 38:47.426
- I CAN TELL.

38:47.459 --> 38:51.096
- OH...

38:51.129 --> 38:54.032
WOULD YOU JUST LOOK...

38:54.065 --> 38:59.438
ALL THIS BEAUTIFUL FOOD.

38:59.471 --> 39:02.541
WHO'D HAVE GUESSED IT, HUH?

39:02.574 --> 39:04.576
OUR LITTLE EM...

39:04.610 --> 39:08.714
SUCH A SUCCESS.

39:08.747 --> 39:12.784
EVERYBODY WANTS HIM.

39:12.818 --> 39:18.590
HOW ABOUT YOU GIVE ME
A GREAT BIG KISS!

39:18.624 --> 39:20.759
I'D ASK YOU TO GIVE ME
A GREAT BIG BLOW JOB,

39:20.792 --> 39:24.396
BUT WE HAVE GUESTS,
SO A KISS'LL HAVE TO DO.

39:24.430 --> 39:28.133
- HOW ABOUT WE GET YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT FIRST? HMM?

39:28.166 --> 39:29.735
- THAT IS A GOOD IDEA.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.603
- REALLY GOOD IDEA.

39:31.637 --> 39:32.871
- YEAH. HERE--
HERE YOU GO, BABY.

39:32.904 --> 39:35.140
HERE, TAKE A BITE OF THIS.
HMM?

39:35.173 --> 39:39.144
- NO, NO, THANK YOU,
I AM ON A LIQUID DIET.

39:39.177 --> 39:42.180
SORT OF A CLEANSING.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.616
DON'T BUDDHISTS DO THAT, BEN?

39:44.650 --> 39:48.620
- OH, UH, YEAH, THEY DO,
BUT NOT WITH PINOT NOIR.

39:48.654 --> 39:50.889
- HERE, HONEY, JUST, UH--
JUST ONE BITE?

39:50.922 --> 39:53.892
FOR ME?
- SAY "PRETTY PLEASE."

39:53.925 --> 39:56.027
- PRETTY PLEASE?

39:56.061 --> 39:58.964
- I DON'T WANT IT.

39:58.997 --> 40:01.533
- COME ON. COME ON, BABY, HERE,
JUST--JUST ONE BITE.

40:01.567 --> 40:06.104
OPEN UP FOR THE CHOO-CHOO!
WOOO-WOOO!

40:06.137 --> 40:08.540
- I SAID NO!

40:13.078 --> 40:16.582
EM?
EM, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

40:16.615 --> 40:18.717
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T MEAN TO...

40:18.750 --> 40:20.919
- ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW. I KNOW. I KNOW.

40:20.952 --> 40:24.690
OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.
OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.

40:24.723 --> 40:27.793
[whispering] YOU HAVE JUST HAD
A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO DRINK,

40:27.826 --> 40:30.662
THAT'S ALL.

40:30.696 --> 40:34.566
- YEAH, I GUESS I HAVE.

40:34.600 --> 40:38.704
- HAPPENS TO THE BEST OF US.

40:38.737 --> 40:43.809
WHY DON'T YOU COME LIE DOWN?
OKAY?

40:43.842 --> 40:46.978
- THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
YEAH.

40:47.012 --> 40:48.814
I'M SUDDENLY, UH...

40:48.847 --> 40:52.117
I'M FEELING VERY, VERY...
VERY TIRED.

41:00.892 --> 41:04.563
- HE JUST NEEDS TO REST.

41:04.596 --> 41:06.898
- I EMPHATICALLY DENY
THAT MY DEPARTMENT'S ACTIONS

41:06.932 --> 41:10.268
REGARDING THE CLOSING
OF A GAY BAR ON LIBERTY AVENUE

41:10.301 --> 41:12.704
HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION

41:12.738 --> 41:14.172
OF ITS PATRONS.

41:14.205 --> 41:16.708
IT WAS PROMPTED ENTIRELY
BY THE FACT

41:16.742 --> 41:19.845
THAT THERE WERE ILLEGAL
ACTIVITIES GOING ON AT THE TIME,

41:19.878 --> 41:23.849
AND AS SUCH, IT WAS THE DUTY
OF THE POLICE TO RESPOND.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.984
AS FOR BEING HOMOPHOBIC,

41:26.017 --> 41:28.787
I FEEL THESE CHARGES WERE MADE
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE

41:28.820 --> 41:32.758
OF DAMAGING MY REPUTATION
AND MY CAMPAIGN FOR MAYOR.

41:32.791 --> 41:35.661
I HOLD NO ANIMOSITY
WHATSOEVER

41:35.694 --> 41:37.663
TOWARDS OUR LAW-ABIDING
GAY CITIZENS,

41:37.696 --> 41:40.732
MANY OF WHOM SUPPORT MY EFFORTS
TO ELIMINATE DRUGS,

41:40.766 --> 41:44.903
PROSTITUTION, AND BUSINESSES
THAT PROFIT FROM ILLICIT SEX.

41:44.936 --> 41:47.172
