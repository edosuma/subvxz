WEBVTT

00:02.510 --> 00:04.380
here's a fun fact.

00:04.390 --> 00:07.990
When virgil wrote, "love conquers
all," what he actually meant was,

00:08.000 --> 00:10.560
love is so powerful that
it ultimately defeats us.

00:10.590 --> 00:13.990
Vinco can also be
translated as "defeat."

00:14.000 --> 00:15.010
Makes you think, huh?

00:15.030 --> 00:17.470
Yeah. Yeah. It makes
me think you're a dork.

00:17.480 --> 00:21.020
Another fun fact-- las vegas has the
second highest divorce rate in the country.

00:21.030 --> 00:23.340
Well, it's a good thing we're not
moving there after we get married.

00:23.370 --> 00:25.340
- Last year my friend mike-- -
are you having an aneurysm moment?

00:25.360 --> 00:27.460
Him and his fiancee decided to
have a quickie wedding in vegas.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.300
Wait, whoa. Your friend
mike from stanford?

00:29.310 --> 00:30.740
I thought he got married,
like, four years ago.

00:30.760 --> 00:33.380
Uh, dierent mike.
Anyway, he rushed into it.

00:33.390 --> 00:38.480
And the day before, he got cold feet and did something
that made his fiancee call the whole thing off.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.490
Well, what did he do?

00:39.500 --> 00:40.640
Uh, I don't know. We're not that close.

00:40.650 --> 00:43.960
All I'm saying is marriage
is a huge commitment.

00:43.980 --> 00:47.820
All right. Uh, is this
above-average eli weirdness?

00:47.830 --> 00:50.400
Does it have anything to do with the
fact that beth took your virginity?

00:50.420 --> 00:52.770
Why can't you ever just say
that beth and I re together?

00:52.790 --> 00:54.880
Why do you always have to
bring up the virginity thing?

00:54.920 --> 00:58.370
Because it's fun, and I noticed you
still haven't answered my question.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.940
Ben loves his uncle eli's flat screen.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.739
Thanks. So have you asked him yet?

01:04.750 --> 01:06.710
Asked me what?

01:06.720 --> 01:11.180
well, we were thinking about promoting
you from best man to minister,

01:11.200 --> 01:13.520
but if you're gonna be moping
about ashley the whole time,

01:13.540 --> 01:15.450
then we're just gonna stick
with the elvis impersonator,

01:15.480 --> 01:19.230
and you might get demoted
to not invited at all.

01:19.260 --> 01:22.640
That would be great. Honor.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.530
That would be a great honor.

01:25.550 --> 01:28.640
I'd love to be the one to marry you.

01:28.650 --> 01:31.140
Does that get me off the ho
with gting you an espresso maker?

01:31.150 --> 01:33.820
- Uh, nice try.
- No. no, not a chance.

01:33.830 --> 01:35.450
I need you to make me a minister.

01:35.480 --> 01:38.240
A minister? Like "our father,
who art in heaven" kind?

01:38.250 --> 01:41.740
Like the web site where you get ordained
in five minutes for a small fee kind.

01:41.770 --> 01:44.690
You're already a prophet. What,
are you padding your resume now?

01:44.700 --> 01:47.750
Nate asked me to
officiate at his wedding.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.360
Why are you frowning?

01:49.380 --> 01:53.070
Marriage is a scared bond
between two people before god.

01:53.090 --> 01:55.060
If you want to make a
mockery of the church, fine.

01:55.090 --> 01:56.760
I don't want any part of that circus.

01:56.790 --> 02:00.240
Yeah, well, it's gonna be freakin' cirque
du soleil if beth leaves nate at the altar.

02:00.260 --> 02:03.430
I had a vision. Nate's
wedding day--beth calls it off.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.270
Are you sure?

02:04.300 --> 02:08.570
Because when it comes to interpreting your
visions, you haven't been exactly nailing it.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.420
Well, if you can think of another
way to interpret beth telling nate,

02:11.450 --> 02:13.730
"I can't marry you," you let me know.

02:13.740 --> 02:14.960
Now why would she do that?

02:14.990 --> 02:19.210
I have no idea, but who betterto get
to the bottom of it than their minister?

02:19.240 --> 02:21.750
In my new capacity, I'll be able
to spend some more time with them

02:21.770 --> 02:24.560
and identify any potential speed bumps.

02:24.590 --> 02:29.010
Or you could just ask nate what the hell is
going on with him and beth in your old capacity

02:29.020 --> 02:32.880
as brother and put that minister
fee toward my christmas present.

02:32.900 --> 02:34.290
I can't talk to nate about beth.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.220
It's the one thing I
can't bring up with him.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.570
It'S... that and halloween 1986.

02:39.580 --> 02:42.030
- 2 things.
- Okay, I get it.

02:42.040 --> 02:46.800
Could you see if that minister package
includes any special clergy parking permits?

02:47.370 --> 02:48.830
Can I help you?

02:48.850 --> 02:50.230
Keith.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.940
How've you been?

02:51.950 --> 02:53.750
Sorry, I... do I know you?

02:53.760 --> 02:55.770
See what happens when
you stop going to church?

02:55.780 --> 02:57.930
You don't even recognize
your own minister.

02:59.310 --> 03:02.500
Hey, uh, reverend stills.

03:02.520 --> 03:04.800
It's michael now, just F.Y.I.

03:04.820 --> 03:08.150
I tried to stay in the same name
family-- you know, michael/michelle...

03:08.160 --> 03:13.470
right, uh, michael. Come in.

03:20.980 --> 03:23.900
Uh, grab a seat, please.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.260
You know, it's--
it's okay to say it.

03:27.730 --> 03:28.960
Say what?

03:28.990 --> 03:32.070
That this is awkward, a huge shock,

03:32.100 --> 03:36.430
especially for someone who hasn't seen
me since christmas mass two years ago.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.960
With that kind of guilt trip,
you should have been a rabbi.

03:38.990 --> 03:42.410
I think somewhere between my 80-hour
workweeks and my love for sunday brunch,

03:42.440 --> 03:45.410
I, uh, just haven't been
able to make it to church.

03:45.430 --> 03:48.070
I haven't exactly been a
regular there myself of late.

03:48.110 --> 03:51.370
Still recuperating from the, um...

03:51.680 --> 03:54.360
- you know, the, uh...
- surgeries.

03:54.370 --> 03:55.980
But I'm recuperating fine.

03:56.010 --> 03:59.050
The congregation still
has some healing to do.

03:59.060 --> 04:01.750
The week I was supposed
to return to the pulpit,

04:01.760 --> 04:04.280
- st.Anne's let me go.
- What?

04:04.290 --> 04:05.750
You know, it's funny.

04:05.770 --> 04:09.020
First I had to fight
to get hired as a woman.

04:09.030 --> 04:12.700
Now they want to fire
me because I'm a man.

04:13.550 --> 04:15.030
it's totally illegal.

04:15.060 --> 04:19.600
State statutes are crystal clear-- you cannot
fire someone just because they're transgendered.

04:19.640 --> 04:20.980
St.Anne's say they can.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.090
To them it's just your
basic contract dispute.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.040
Let me guess--
changed circumstance?

04:25.070 --> 04:28.510
Technically, their contract is
with michelle stills, not michael.

04:28.540 --> 04:32.460
Which is legalese for "we don't want a
transsexual heading up our congregation."

04:32.470 --> 04:33.530
What's your strategy?

04:33.560 --> 04:35.810
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

04:35.830 --> 04:37.490
This kind of thing--
social justice case--

04:37.510 --> 04:41.040
it's right in your wheelhouse and
more in my, you know, house of worship.

04:41.070 --> 04:42.400
Which means you know the players.

04:42.420 --> 04:43.210
Too well.

04:43.220 --> 04:46.620
The reverend and the congregation-- it'd
be like litigating my parents' divorce.

04:46.650 --> 04:48.020
Have you thought about mediation?

04:48.050 --> 04:53.190
Come on. Look, spiritual leader changes
his life and gets fired in the process?

04:53.200 --> 04:56.730
This isn't right up your alley.
It's sitting in your living room.

04:57.210 --> 05:00.150
All right, I'll talk to him.But
if I have any questions--

05:00.160 --> 05:03.440
anything I'd know, the reverend
would know better. Trust me.

05:04.220 --> 05:07.550
You will never believe
what I got on ebay.

05:08.820 --> 05:11.310
- cute.
- Cute?

05:11.320 --> 05:14.280
Our kid's gonna be the next wayne gretzky
thanks to me, and that's all you can say?

05:14.290 --> 05:17.430
No, I can also say no child of
ours is gonna play ice hockey.

05:17.450 --> 05:20.930
Why? Sports are healthy,
competitive. It's a good thing.

05:20.940 --> 05:24.630
Losing your front teeth because someone
up-sticks you is not a good thing.

05:24.650 --> 05:26.800
- It's called high-sticking. -
Whatever. Can we argue about this later?

05:26.810 --> 05:29.750
I've gotta finish filling out this
stupid genetic questionnaire thingy.

05:29.770 --> 05:32.370
You're not done with that? You got,
like, two people in your family.

05:32.380 --> 05:36.550
One, and he's taking a vacation from his
recent divorce and completely unreachable.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.970
Not to mention you two aren't
actually speaking to eh other.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.220
Yeah, you really want to be
getting in the middle of that.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.420
Good point.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.740
So I'm thinking we should
start slow, you know?

05:44.770 --> 05:48.010
A few trips to the
rink, ride the zamboni--

05:48.030 --> 05:49.930
- french.
- French?

05:49.940 --> 05:51.840
You want our child
playing a canadian sport?

05:51.870 --> 05:54.890
He or she is gonna have
to learn the language.

05:54.900 --> 05:58.850
That is some shrewd
negotiating, wethersby.

06:00.570 --> 06:02.900
- are we done y?
- Almost. I just got a couple more.

06:02.910 --> 06:06.600
All right. Are you gonna write your own vows,
or are you gonna go with traditional vows?

06:06.610 --> 06:07.780
We're writing our own.

06:07.810 --> 06:11.450
And, um, will ben be
participating in the ceremony?

06:11.480 --> 06:15.170
- A way to include him, that'd be terrific.
- Absolutely.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.860
How's ben's father?

06:17.890 --> 06:21.230
How would I know? And why do you care?

06:21.590 --> 06:22.870
Well, I just...

06:22.890 --> 06:26.490
I wondered if he'd been more
of a part of his life recently.

06:26.510 --> 06:28.470
No. No, he hasn'T. Can I go now?

06:28.480 --> 06:30.400
'Cause I gotta get back to the office

06:30.420 --> 06:32.240
so late?

06:32.270 --> 06:33.670
You're putting in a lot of time there.

06:33.690 --> 06:36.750
Well, you know, new clinics
don't exactly build themselves.

06:36.760 --> 06:40.000
And beth's okay with you
starting your own practice?

06:40.030 --> 06:44.460
I mean, you know, talk
about a stress trigger.

06:46.790 --> 06:48.540
You had a vision about
my wedding, didn't you?

06:48.550 --> 06:52.250
What? No. no.

06:54.370 --> 06:55.420
why would you think that?

06:55.450 --> 06:57.720
Because you're acting like you think
the whole thing's gonna blow up.

06:57.740 --> 07:02.620
No, I'm not. Really. I just...

07:03.140 --> 07:05.730
feel like I've given up
my shot at a normal life.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.850
- For an extraordinary one.
- Maybe.

07:07.860 --> 07:13.880
You know, I don't get the wife, the
kids, the walk-in closet, and you do.

07:14.200 --> 07:20.340
So if--if I seem overly invested
in your life working out, then...

07:21.140 --> 07:23.470
can you blame me?

07:24.780 --> 07:26.000
No.

07:26.020 --> 07:30.960
Nobody wants your wedding to go
well more than I do. Believe me.

07:44.070 --> 07:45.190
Just the man I wanted to see.

07:45.210 --> 07:47.760
- If this is about the stills
case, eli-- - did I say it was?

07:47.770 --> 07:49.680
I need some help with a contract matter.

07:49.710 --> 07:51.400
I'm on my way to meet
with the client right now,

07:51.430 --> 07:55.360
and he's noticed that things are kind of
lean on the ground here personnel-wise.

07:55.390 --> 07:56.570
What's the contractual issue?

07:56.580 --> 07:58.360
Wrongful t termination.

07:58.370 --> 08:01.350
Discrimination, specifically.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.440
Hey, so glad you're gonna
be helping us out, keith.

08:03.460 --> 08:07.030
It's great news, huh?
I just found out myself.

08:08.410 --> 08:10.660
Thought you said this
wasn't about the stills case.

08:10.680 --> 08:13.030
I think my exact words
were, "did I say it was?"

08:13.050 --> 08:18.170
But if you feel like you've been, I don't
know, played, feel free to tell our client.

08:21.090 --> 08:25.270
Dr. Conroy and the board have agreed to pay
out the two remaining years on michelle'contract

08:25.280 --> 08:30.800
plus a year of health coverage and the
$25,000 kicker we already mentioned.

08:30.830 --> 08:32.850
You can't put a price
tag on a congregation.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.380
We're mere attempting to recognize
michelle's contribution to st. Anne'S.

08:36.390 --> 08:40.460
He built your church in every way except
maybe providing the brick and mortar.

08:40.490 --> 08:42.320
He grew its congregation
from only 50 people--

08:42.330 --> 08:46.860
to over 1,000.Yes, I know, except
now most of those people are leaving.

08:46.890 --> 08:48.670
Because you wouldn't
let me speak to them.

08:48.690 --> 08:50.470
You wouldn't let me
calm their prejudices.

08:50.490 --> 08:53.350
Well, at least you acknowledge
they have a prejudice.

08:53.370 --> 08:57.750
That's not something that you can
wipe away with a pretty sermon.

09:01.850 --> 09:03.030
It's not a bad idea.

09:03.050 --> 09:04.510
Why not give the reverend
a shot at a sermon?

09:04.540 --> 09:07.630
If people still feel the same way afterwards,
you can revisit the settlement then.

09:07.650 --> 09:11.860
If I thought that a sermon wod do anything
other than merely inflame passions,

09:11.890 --> 09:16.110
I would be sitting in
the front pew right now.

09:16.140 --> 09:21.590
But it won't, and I think that it's time for
you to tnk about doing what's best for them.

09:21.610 --> 09:23.690
So I'm not only a
freak, I'm a selfish one?

09:23.720 --> 09:25.010
Well, that's not the point.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.630
I think we're done here.

09:36.050 --> 09:40.350
I'm sorry. I thought they would want to avoid
the expense and the embarrassment of a trial.

09:40.360 --> 09:43.960
Just the latest in a string of disappointing
behavior on their part, mr. Stone.

09:43.990 --> 09:48.910
Still, you gotta ask yourself-- do you
want to go through the ordeal of a trial?

09:48.950 --> 09:52.310
I spent the first 30 years of my
life trapped in the wrong body.

09:52.350 --> 09:56.350
Your definition of "ordeal" is
probably a little different from mine.

10:00.630 --> 10:02.600
This is crazy.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.640
Oh, my god. Look at this little guy.

10:04.650 --> 10:08.050
- He's so wrinkled and scrawny.
- And naked.

10:08.060 --> 10:11.380
I'm sure he'll be thrilled when he
finds out this picture's out in public.

10:11.810 --> 10:13.620
Do you think our baby
will look like that?

10:13.650 --> 10:14.750
You kidding me?

10:14.770 --> 10:18.680
It's genetically impossible for our baby to
be anything but beautiful if you're the mom.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.230
Sorry to keep you waiting.

10:21.240 --> 10:25.330
- Um, this might be, um...
- is everything okay?

10:25.340 --> 10:27.270
Have a seat.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.360
We got your blood work back.

10:31.370 --> 10:32.900
This is nothing to panic about,

10:32.920 --> 10:37.070
but your protein levels are quite a
bit higher than we'd like them to be.

10:37.090 --> 10:38.500
Protein levels?

10:38.510 --> 10:42.120
Markers. They tell us the likelihood
of a baby having a chromosomal problem,

10:42.130 --> 10:45.570
and right now yours
are well above normal.

10:45.580 --> 10:48.540
So the baby might have, um, down's?

10:48.560 --> 10:50.850
We're not gonna get
ahead of ourselves here.

10:50.860 --> 10:55.430
These tests have a lot of false
positives, but I needed to make you aware.

10:55.440 --> 10:58.460
okay. Um, what do we, uh...

10:58.780 --> 11:00.320
what's the next step?

11:00.330 --> 11:05.170
We need to get taylor back in here
as soon as possible, do a C.V.S.

11:05.190 --> 11:09.680
Then we'll be able to tell what's
really going on with your baby, okay?

11:10.990 --> 11:12.990
thank you.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.920
so what do you want to do?

11:22.130 --> 11:24.510
Go home. Now.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.080
- Is everything okay with eli?
- why?

11:27.090 --> 11:29.330
He just--ah, he seems
really high-strung.

11:29.350 --> 11:32.070
You've known him all of his life,
and you're just noticing all this now?

11:32.110 --> 11:35.860
Well, I mean, you know, he seems
more high-strung than usual,

11:35.880 --> 11:38.720
particularly since beth and i
announced that we were eloping.

11:38.740 --> 11:42.250
I... just seems like he knows
something's gonna happen.

11:43.910 --> 11:46.220
Did he tell you he had a vision?

11:46.250 --> 11:48.200
Well, I asked him, but he denied it.

11:48.220 --> 11:52.120
Well, he hasn't come to me about
it, if that's what you're thinking.

11:52.160 --> 11:55.910
To be honest, he hasn't
been around much lately.

11:55.930 --> 11:58.510
Did you guys have a
falling out or somhing?

11:58.520 --> 11:59.670
Something.

11:59.680 --> 12:03.440
Do you think you could check my dad's
journal, you know, just to see if,

12:03.450 --> 12:05.330
I don't know, if he
references my wedding or...

12:05.350 --> 12:09.310
uh, I will, but I'm sure there isn'T.

12:09.620 --> 12:14.790
Look, go get married and let me take care
of your brother for once in your life, okay?

12:16.740 --> 12:19.690
okay. Thanks.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.400
"I promise"? That's it?

12:25.410 --> 12:27.630
- Nate's at four pages and counting.
- I know.

12:27.640 --> 12:31.640
And I don't think I'm spilling any state
secrets wh i say there will be tears.

12:31.660 --> 12:33.580
You are not helping.

12:33.590 --> 12:35.400
Why don't you start
with the night you met?

12:35.410 --> 12:37.430
At your aborted engagement party?

12:37.450 --> 12:39.770
I had completely repressed that.

12:39.800 --> 12:40.780
What about your first date?

12:40.800 --> 12:42.610
Oh, it was awful.

12:42.620 --> 12:43.640
Nate didn't tell you that?

12:43.670 --> 12:46.730
He didn't tell me he was seeing you until
after I asked you out on a date, remember?

12:46.750 --> 12:51.240
That's a good point. Well, he was two hours
late, and then by the time he got there,

12:51.250 --> 12:53.510
I had my babysitter for another hour,

12:53.560 --> 12:56.860
and we went and wolfed down some buffalo
wings at a dive bar near my house.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.410
How did he turn it around?

12:58.440 --> 13:02.960
I figure he's your brother, must
have some of your lovable qualities.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.470
- I see you bought a piano.
- Yes.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.720
Is ben taking lessons?

13:08.760 --> 13:12.090
No, but, um, he likes
it when I play for him.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.720
Go on. Come on.

13:15.870 --> 13:18.810
Okay.

13:28.560 --> 13:36.450
* didn't I say I wasn't
ready for a romance?*

13:36.890 --> 13:44.570
* Didn't I promise we
would only be friends?*

13:45.310 --> 13:53.510
* And then we danced and though
it only was a slow dance *

13:53.990 --> 14:01.280
* I began breaking my
promises right there and then *

14:01.290 --> 14:09.240
* this night is mine *

14:09.250 --> 14:16.630
* it's only you and I *

14:17.360 --> 14:24.610
* tomorrow is a long time away *

14:24.620 --> 14:32.780
* this night can last forever *

14:37.070 --> 14:39.730
that was beautiful.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.950
Uh, I should probably get going.

14:45.960 --> 14:50.450
I, um, will let you get ben to bed.

14:52.190 --> 14:55.110
I'll let myself out.

15:05.620 --> 15:07.630
we didn't fire michelle
because she's transgendered.

15:07.650 --> 15:11.090
We exercised the clause in her contract
permitting us to terminate her employment

15:11.120 --> 15:12.760
in the event of a changed circumstance.

15:12.780 --> 15:15.030
Your honor, I don't know
if dr. Conroy is aware,

15:15.040 --> 15:16.300
but reverend stills is a man,

15:16.330 --> 15:19.350
and I would appreciate instruction
for him to refer to my client as such.

15:19.360 --> 15:22.150
Reverend stills is still
genetically female, your honor.

15:22.180 --> 15:25.780
How about we just avoid the personal
pronouns, ladies and gentlemen?

15:25.810 --> 15:28.470
- Your honor.
- Sit down, mr. Stone.

15:28.480 --> 15:33.730
so I'm sure that reverend stills would say that
you are dressing bigotry up in contractual terms.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.670
And she--or
he--would be wrong.

15:36.710 --> 15:40.060
The fact of the matter is, the reverendsn't
the same person we originally hired.

15:40.130 --> 15:43.620
That is not prejudice.
That's just reality.

15:45.310 --> 15:48.450
The reality is that the
united methodist church

15:48.480 --> 15:52.470
has no specific policies
regarding gender reassignment.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.060
- Is that correct, dr. Conroy?
- Yes.

15:54.070 --> 15:56.970
So even though your own church
welcomes the transgendered,

15:57.000 --> 16:00.510
you still chose to fire reverend
stills because he had a sex change.

16:00.540 --> 16:02.750
We fired him because he
violated his contract.

16:02.770 --> 16:05.670
This would be the "changed
circumstance" excuse.

16:05.700 --> 16:06.760
No, it's not A.

16:06.770 --> 16:08.910
But the only thing that
has changed is his sex.

16:08.920 --> 16:13.870
his love of preaching, his passion for st.
Anne's, his message have all stayed the same.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.970
But his ability to
tell the truth has not.

16:15.990 --> 16:20.210
Outside the church, the reverend lived
as a man for two years before the surgery

16:20.250 --> 16:23.110
and never said a word to me
or anyone else at st. Anne'S.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.190
Maybe the reverend was
afraid of losing his job.

16:25.220 --> 16:26.890
I mean, clearly, he had reason to be.

16:26.910 --> 16:29.870
What did he expect? Lying is
a sin. It has consequences.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.040
So does judging.

16:31.070 --> 16:34.030
We simply don't want a liar
guiding our spiritual lives.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.120
The congregation doesn't, or you don't?

16:36.130 --> 16:37.260
That is what t congregación o usted?

16:37.270 --> 16:40.370
So they told you, but they couldn't be
bothered to come here today to tell us?

16:40.390 --> 16:43.620
Your co-counsel is a member of
st. Anne'S. Why don't we ask him?

16:43.630 --> 16:47.620
Objection. I'm not the one
under oath here, your honor.

16:50.570 --> 16:52.350
That was quite the
full-throated defense.

16:52.370 --> 16:53.510
Best to just shut conroy down.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.890
You don't want him making
this case all about me.

16:54.910 --> 16:56.970
Why don't I, keith?
Aren't you my lawyer?

16:56.980 --> 16:59.190
Yes, which is why I
gotta look at both sides.

16:59.210 --> 17:01.400
I wasn't aware bigotry
had more than one side.

17:01.430 --> 17:03.230
Keith, maybe you and i should
talk about this back at the office.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.530
No. No, no, no. I think
he needs to hear this.

17:05.540 --> 17:06.950
These are good people, reverend.

17:06.980 --> 17:10.410
Now I know it would be a lot easier if they
were just a bunch of ug bigots, but they're not.

17:10.430 --> 17:13.240
They fired me because
I had a sex change.

17:13.270 --> 17:15.050
They fired you because you lied to them.

17:15.060 --> 17:17.369
I lied because I had to.

17:17.410 --> 17:18.599
I knew they wouldn't see me.

17:18.609 --> 17:20.470
I just think they see someone
they don't know anymore.

17:20.490 --> 17:24.630
Do you really think that just because I
changed my sex I can't lead the congregation,

17:24.640 --> 17:27.020
that I'm less capable,
not as good at my job?

17:27.060 --> 17:28.390
That's not what we're suggesting.

17:28.420 --> 17:29.990
Maybe it is.

17:30.030 --> 17:32.240
You used to listen to what
your congregants had to say.

17:32.250 --> 17:35.450
But I did this for them, so
I'd be a better pastor for them.

17:35.490 --> 17:36.560
I don't think they're grateful.

17:36.590 --> 17:40.640
Because I haven't been given
the chance to tell them.

17:40.660 --> 17:44.060
I've lost my pulpit.

17:44.530 --> 17:47.500
Even if I could force the
church to let you give a sermon,

17:47.540 --> 17:49.360
I can't force anyone to listen.

17:49.370 --> 17:53.290
And what about you? Are you listening?

18:03.280 --> 18:04.870
Maybe it was just a false alarm.

18:04.910 --> 18:07.850
The doctor did say there was
a high false positive rate.

18:07.860 --> 18:11.310
High is 8%. I looked it up.

18:11.320 --> 18:14.870
The faster we get the follow-up
test done, the sooner we'll know.

18:14.900 --> 18:18.940
I just can't face mang a
decision like that right now.

18:18.970 --> 18:21.110
You mean whether to take the test?

18:21.140 --> 18:25.490
No, I mean the decision after
that, you know? The big decision.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.400
What?

18:33.420 --> 18:35.610
I guess I just...

18:35.630 --> 18:38.560
I never thought you'd put
something like that on the table.

18:38.570 --> 18:39.900
I didn'T. It just is.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.840
It doesn't have to be.

18:41.880 --> 18:46.190
What I mean is, after seeing the
baby last week, that tiny heart,

18:46.230 --> 18:48.660
I-I never thought
you'd even consider...

18:48.680 --> 18:50.580
are you saying you
haven't thought about it?

18:50.610 --> 18:52.010
Yeah, but I also
thought that--

18:52.020 --> 18:55.130
so because I want to think about it a little
bit longer, that makes me a bad mother?

18:55.150 --> 18:56.000
That's not what I meant.

18:56.030 --> 18:57.170
That's how it sounded.

18:57.180 --> 19:00.020
Oh, just cut me some slack here.

19:00.050 --> 19:03.400
Two months ago, our biggest concern
was where to go for happy hour.

19:03.430 --> 19:07.800
I'm sorry I didn't think to bring up
potential genetic disorders over margaritas.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.220
Look, let's just...

19:10.240 --> 19:14.930
we shouldn't be fighting.
Not about this. Not now.

19:20.130 --> 19:23.350
This can't be the first time that you
thought you were representing the wrong side.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.100
I don't think the reverend's wrong, eli.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.490
I just... don't think he's right.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.480
He is still the same person.

19:29.510 --> 19:31.180
He's not the same person, eli.

19:31.220 --> 19:34.830
Political correctness
aside, he is different.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.540
W-were you the same
after your diagnosis?

19:37.560 --> 19:43.660
No, but I could say that it actually
brought me closer to who I really am.

19:43.670 --> 19:45.970
Doesn't mean everyone around
you felt the same way--

19:46.010 --> 19:49.960
eli, I have to show you what--
I'm sorry. I'm interrupting.

19:49.970 --> 19:53.310
It's okay. I was, uh,
I was just leaving.

19:53.850 --> 19:56.860
I-I probably shouldn't
be barging in on you.

19:56.890 --> 20:00.760
Please. It's your inalienable
right as my sister-in-law.

20:00.770 --> 20:03.110
It's just you know nate's
taste so well, and I really,

20:03.140 --> 20:06.990
really wanted to get your
opinion on his groom's gift.

20:09.370 --> 20:11.540
What do you think?

20:11.550 --> 20:14.900
Yeah, I think I want to get
married so I can have this watch.

20:14.920 --> 20:18.680
That's tremendous. Nate's gonna love it.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.920
Is everything okay?

20:30.420 --> 20:36.420
If I asked you a question, could you
answer it and then forget I ever asked it?

20:36.820 --> 20:40.600
I don't know. I guess that
would depend on the question.

20:40.610 --> 20:46.730
Is there anything that might keep you
from going through with the wedding?

20:48.090 --> 20:50.180
Why would you ask me that?

20:50.210 --> 20:53.810
- You have to forget I asked, remember?
- Yeah.

20:55.940 --> 20:58.360
Are you sure that everything's okay?

20:58.380 --> 21:00.430
I'M... everything's great.

21:00.440 --> 21:02.980
I'm just... got a lot of work.

21:02.990 --> 21:08.580
I got this tough case, and my
head is just... just... so...

21:10.050 --> 21:13.140
I'll see you later okay?

21:21.780 --> 21:26.420
I have this sinking feeling it's similar
to the time I was playing spin the bottle,

21:26.460 --> 21:29.850
and it was karen lazar's turn, and I'm
just watching the bottle spin and spin,

21:29.880 --> 21:31.570
and I'm wondering,
"where's it gonna land?"

21:31.580 --> 21:37.280
And then it just hit me, it was
gonna land on me. I just freaked out.

21:37.700 --> 21:39.190
She had those bands
on her braces--

21:39.200 --> 21:40.910
do you typically talk this much?

21:40.950 --> 21:42.330
Only when I'm anxious.

21:42.350 --> 21:44.350
So all the time then.

21:45.530 --> 21:47.100
All right.

21:47.110 --> 21:50.430
Just... don't tell
frank we're doing this.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.070
We're not friends.

22:05.770 --> 22:08.290
beth?

22:10.230 --> 22:14.680
I had to pull you out. Your
convulsions were becoming too severe.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.630
did she give you special herbs
on your way out for the pain

22:27.670 --> 22:31.020
that's funny.Usually I'm the one showing
up at your place saying crazy things.

22:31.060 --> 22:33.960
You went to her, didn't you? Dr. Lee.

22:34.290 --> 22:36.780
I gotta pack for vegas.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.960
You haven't had any visions since
you started seeing dr. Lee, have you?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.180
Maybe god gave me the week
off for my brother's wedding.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.810
Or maybe you've been
messing with the dark truth.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.760
It's too dangerous, especially
for someone with your condition.

22:47.790 --> 22:49.790
You're the one who got me into
the dark truth in the first place!

22:49.830 --> 22:52.520
Not so you could use your divine
connection for selfish reasons.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.960
I'm trying to keep nate's
heart from getting broken.

22:54.990 --> 22:56.330
So just...

22:56.360 --> 22:57.830
it's not your responsibility, eli.

22:57.860 --> 23:02.770
I just found out that the wedding gets
called off because nate finds beth kissing me.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.780
- Then don't go to vegas.
- And miss my brother's wedding?

23:04.790 --> 23:06.480
See, this is why I
didn't want to tell you.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.860
You didn't tell me because you
know you're stepping off the path,

23:08.920 --> 23:12.120
and you know that's fundamentally wrong.

23:12.130 --> 23:15.100
I got a plane to catch.

23:15.880 --> 23:20.180
One honeymoon suite for the happy couple...A
deluxe room foyour son right next door,

23:20.220 --> 23:23.140
and a luxury suite for the
best man right across the hall.

23:23.160 --> 23:23.850
Perfect.

23:23.860 --> 23:27.200
Um, do you think I could get,
um, upgraded to a different floor?

23:27.230 --> 23:29.140
Well, there are no urades
from the penthouse floor.

23:29.170 --> 23:31.660
You have a view of the strip,
access to the roof deck--

23:31.710 --> 23:35.110
how about a lower floor,o i could
be close to the casino and all the--

23:35.150 --> 23:37.990
- smoke and noise?
- Exactly.

23:39.260 --> 23:41.240
- Here.
- What's this?

23:41.250 --> 23:43.980
Uh, that's a scrip for thorazine.
It's a common antipsychotic.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.340
I'm not the one getting married.

23:45.370 --> 23:48.460
no, no, but you are the
one acting psychotic.

23:48.480 --> 23:51.520
You're treating beth like she has leprosy,
and don't think she hasn't noticed.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.890
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.530
Okay.

23:55.560 --> 24:00.000
I have a junior room on the second
floor right next to the ice machine.

24:00.030 --> 24:03.690
It's as far away from the penthouses as
you can get without being in the basement.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.540
Thank you.

24:14.200 --> 24:15.790
Reverend stills?

24:15.800 --> 24:17.360
- Keith, what are you--
- I hope it's okay.

24:17.370 --> 24:20.040
Some of the congregation are my
neighbors. They said you might be here.

24:20.050 --> 24:22.020
I'm just about to start
my saturday bible study.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.240
At a community center?

24:23.260 --> 24:25.330
It's just temporary, hopefully.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.640
Yeah, uh, about that.

24:27.650 --> 24:30.180
I'm sorry for what happened yesterday.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.180
I think you're right. I
haven't been listening.

24:32.190 --> 24:35.840
But starting monday
morning, I'm gonna try.

24:35.850 --> 24:41.720
Or you could start now if
you want. Come on. Come on.

24:44.970 --> 24:48.470
Everyone, this is keith bennett.

24:48.490 --> 24:51.620
He'll be joining us today.

24:56.680 --> 24:59.050
You ready? Beth's not gettin
any more marriable here.

24:59.060 --> 25:01.320
Yeahyeah. Just fixing ben's tie here.

25:01.330 --> 25:03.710
- Thanks.
- See you in there, buddy.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.960
Whewayok. Let's go.

25:06.970 --> 25:08.580
I cannot believe I'm getting married.

25:08.610 --> 25:09.850
I really have to thank you...

25:09.880 --> 25:10.890
you can thank me after the ceremony.

25:10.920 --> 25:16.940
Not just for introducing me to beth, but, you
know, it's so easy to mock you incessantly that,

25:16.950 --> 25:21.110
uh, sometimes I forget to tell you how
lucky I feel to have you as my brother...

25:21.140 --> 25:22.330
let's go.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.840
'Cause, uh, I don't--I don't
know what I'd do without you.

25:26.600 --> 25:29.410
You're my best friend.

25:31.250 --> 25:35.310
Thank you. I feel the same way.

25:38.110 --> 25:39.390
um, you got the rings?

25:39.430 --> 25:42.160
Uh, yeah. Wait, no.
Don't you have the rings?

25:42.170 --> 25:44.290
- Oh, dear god.
- The best man h the rings.

25:44.300 --> 25:46.350
I got promoted to minister, remember?

25:46.380 --> 25:50.360
Ah, you know what? They must be in the
nightstand drawer upstairs. Can you go get 'em?

25:51.180 --> 25:54.730
Thank you. Thank you.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.760
galatians 3:28.

25:58.770 --> 26:00.730
"There is neither jew nogreek.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.650
"There is neither slave nor free.

26:03.660 --> 26:06.330
"There is neither male nor female.

26:06.360 --> 26:09.000
For you are all one in christ jesus."

26:09.020 --> 26:12.510
Okay, so it's obvious
that one didn't take.

26:12.530 --> 26:15.170
Joanna had some issues with her priest.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.870
My priest, my family, my neighbors.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.720
What do you take from the passage?

26:19.740 --> 26:22.060
That it's not true.

26:22.070 --> 26:26.820
If people were really one in christ, how could
my boyfriend have left me after the operation?

26:26.830 --> 26:29.220
Why did my friends abandon me?

26:29.260 --> 26:31.830
Maybe you should ask yourself
why you haven't forgiven them.

26:31.860 --> 26:34.160
Because they don't deserve it.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.820
Forgiveness isn't a gift we give others.

26:36.860 --> 26:38.600
It's something we give ourselves.

26:38.620 --> 26:43.370
"There is neither male nor female,
for you are all one in christ jesus."

26:43.400 --> 26:46.240
That's not a defense
of transgendered-ness.

26:46.250 --> 26:50.610
But it is an affirmation of
spiritual equality where each of us--

26:50.620 --> 26:52.760
has equal access to god.

26:52.770 --> 26:55.220
Exactly.How
did you--

26:55.230 --> 26:59.780
you said the same thing during a sermon--
the first sermon I ever heard you give.

27:00.190 --> 27:04.420
I guess something about it
just really stayed with me.

27:06.020 --> 27:08.860
Let's continue.

27:09.380 --> 27:15.580
okay. Where are the... oh, my god.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.020
you're, uh...

27:20.050 --> 27:23.060
you're supposed to be
downstairs in the chapel.

27:23.080 --> 27:26.070
Why aren't you down in the chapel?

27:26.080 --> 27:27.390
Um, you got the rings.

27:27.410 --> 27:30.980
I, uh, that's whatI came
up here for. Let's go.

27:30.990 --> 27:31.970
Nate forgot to give them to you.

27:31.990 --> 27:34.510
I saw them. I was gonna tell him, but...

27:36.520 --> 27:40.440
I don't think I can do this.

27:40.770 --> 27:43.390
I'm gonna go and get nate, okay?

27:43.410 --> 27:45.380
Um, you guys should talk.

27:45.390 --> 27:46.890
I need to talk to you, elI.

27:46.910 --> 27:48.270
I think that we should talk.

27:48.280 --> 27:52.220
No, this is just-- this is--it's
cold feet. That's all this is.

27:52.230 --> 27:55.570
That's what I've been
telling myself, but I think...

27:55.580 --> 27:58.500
I thk that it's you.

27:58.520 --> 28:02.430
You're wearing a wedding dress.
You don't get to talk like this.

28:02.440 --> 28:06.560
No, that's why we have to talk,
because I don't want to hurt nate.

28:06.570 --> 28:07.500
Then marry him.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.940
even if I have feelings for you?

28:08.960 --> 28:13.690
I can't lie about that my whole
life. I've tried. I've been trying.

28:13.700 --> 28:14.980
That's not who you are.

28:15.010 --> 28:18.330
I know. I love nate. I do.

28:19.380 --> 28:21.130
But I think I love you, too.

28:21.150 --> 28:22.900
And I don't--I don't
want to do this.

28:22.930 --> 28:27.410
I can't do this without knowing
whethe you feel the same way.

28:31.380 --> 28:36.520
I don'T.

28:40.330 --> 28:44.510
look, I'm gonna go get
nate. You should just...

28:44.520 --> 28:47.260
- beth?
- Nate...

28:47.660 --> 28:51.600
I'm so sorry. I can't marry you.

28:51.610 --> 28:54.100
- I'm so sorry.
- Beth!

28:58.310 --> 29:00.400
nate?

29:04.830 --> 29:08.870
oh, hey, um, I know you were scheduled to do
michael's direct, and I-I was kind of hoping--

29:08.890 --> 29:12.920
and I know I haven't exactly earned it--
but, well, I'd like to do it instead.

29:12.940 --> 29:15.420
- I have this take that I
think would really-- - sure.

29:15.430 --> 29:18.260
Sure? Don't you want
to hear the idea first?

29:18.270 --> 29:22.100
No. I trust you.

29:22.110 --> 29:25.700
- Must have been a hell of a weekend in vegas.
- Yeah.

29:27.590 --> 29:32.940
Reverend, could you please tell us what happened
the day your employment at st. Anne's was terminated?

29:32.950 --> 29:34.880
It was a sunday.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.990
I'd been up the night
before preparing my sern.

29:38.010 --> 29:43.450
It was my first one back since the operations,
so you could say I was fairly anxious.

29:44.130 --> 29:49.790
I was headed to the chapel
when dr. Conroy pulled me aside.

29:49.810 --> 29:52.490
- That's when I got the news.
- Right before services?

29:52.500 --> 29:53.470
Yes.

29:53.490 --> 29:55.070
What did you say to the congregation?

29:55.100 --> 29:59.290
I wasn't given the opportunity
to say anything to them.

29:59.300 --> 30:01.480
So you never gave your sermon?

30:01.510 --> 30:03.700
No, I didn'T.

30:03.740 --> 30:07.370
With the court's permission, I think
you should have that chance right now.

30:07.410 --> 30:12.660
As illuminating as the sermon might be, I fail
to see its relevance to a simple contract dispute.

30:12.680 --> 30:16.360
The dispute is over whether the reverend
is the same minister the church hired.

30:16.390 --> 30:18.410
Can you think of a
better way to prove he is?

30:18.440 --> 30:21.040
I'll allow it.

30:28.870 --> 30:34.820
In matthew16, peter
asks jesus who he is,

30:34.830 --> 30:40.260
and jesus responds, "who do
you say I am?Who are you?"

30:41.990 --> 30:45.920
For the past 30 years,
I didn't know the answer.

30:45.960 --> 30:50.580
For 30 years, I have been a prisoner.

30:51.310 --> 30:56.670
My soul may be safe for heaven but
remains trapped in the wrong body on earth.

30:57.490 --> 31:01.900
Two years ago, I embarked on a
journey to free my soul from that body

31:01.910 --> 31:04.480
to one which mirrored my soul,

31:04.520 --> 31:08.160
rather than hold it captive.

31:09.080 --> 31:14.720
And I come back to you
now, the prodigal son--

31:16.220 --> 31:20.520
finally a son in flesh
as well as spirit,

31:21.060 --> 31:26.920
a son returned home and
seeking understanding.

31:27.800 --> 31:31.900
I know finally the answer to
christ's question to peter.

31:32.290 --> 31:36.020
I know who I am.

31:36.510 --> 31:42.700
And with your reaction, all of
you will tell me who you are.

31:47.450 --> 31:51.750
And what did you hope
their reaction would be?

31:51.760 --> 31:55.190
Acceptance...

31:55.820 --> 31:57.820
unders G...

31:58.550 --> 32:02.470
an expression of t erancethat
was christ's teaching.

32:04.080 --> 32:08.110
Sounds like you had more faith in your
flock than the leaders of your church did.

32:14.900 --> 32:17.870
taylor? Everything all right?

32:18.250 --> 32:22.290
Yeah, I'm--I'm just
having a day. I'm fine.

32:22.840 --> 32:26.330
I can recognize hormones
a hundred miles off.

32:26.340 --> 32:30.390
Somebody even looked at me
funny, I'd lose it on 'em.

32:31.600 --> 32:34.680
this is a little more than hormones.

32:34.690 --> 32:38.220
We found out there might be
something wrong with the baby.

32:39.640 --> 32:42.780
Taylor, I'm so sorry.

32:42.790 --> 32:45.470
It's nothing definite, you
know? It might turn out to bfine.

32:45.480 --> 32:48.670
It's just that when matt and i
wanted to talk about it, about--

32:48.680 --> 32:52.730
you had the mother of
all fights, so to speak.

32:52.740 --> 32:56.250
More like a cold war,
actually, but it's funny.

32:56.280 --> 33:01.030
You know, I've spent all this time wondering
whether or not he was gonna be a good father. I...

33:01.730 --> 33:04.860
I never thought, am I a
terrible mother just because--

33:04.870 --> 33:08.540
you were thinking of
yourself instead of the baby.

33:09.130 --> 33:11.410
That's what you should be doing.

33:11.440 --> 33:13.480
I'm not sure the baby books
would agree with you, patti.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.080
Well, who are you gonna listen to, hmm?

33:18.260 --> 33:22.140
Some exper or an actual mother?

33:22.530 --> 33:28.670
You know how when those little yellow masks drop
in an airplane, they tell you put on yours first.

33:28.710 --> 33:30.380
You know why they do that?

33:30.400 --> 33:34.850
Because if you pass out,
you can't help your child.

33:34.880 --> 33:41.030
You've got to do what's good for
you, or you're no good for anybody.

33:44.530 --> 33:47.050
I hope you're right.

33:47.550 --> 33:50.990
When have you ever known me to be wrong?

33:54.140 --> 33:57.280
I didn't want to just show up at your
shop in case you were with a client.

33:57.290 --> 33:59.770
Like that's stopped you before.

33:59.780 --> 34:03.840
For what it's worth, I didn't exactly
enjoy my sessions with dr. Lee.

34:03.860 --> 34:06.230
You think I care that you
went to another acupuncturist?

34:06.260 --> 34:08.659
You want to shop around for
another guru, be my guest.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.540
I'll give you referrals.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.610
You're mad about this
whole dark truth thing.

34:12.639 --> 34:14.000
Yeah, what was your first clue?

34:14.010 --> 34:17.080
When I told you it was dangerous,
did you think I was just kidding?

34:17.090 --> 34:19.590
I know. I screwed up.

34:19.600 --> 34:23.449
If there were a dark truth anonymous,
I'd be at a meeting right now.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.630
- But I-- -
but nothin'.

34:25.639 --> 34:28.280
You can't rationalize your way
out of endangering your life.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.940
I know, but this was nate's life.

34:30.980 --> 34:32.679
I wanted him to be happy.

34:32.699 --> 34:34.900
Then youhouldn't have gone to
vegas, like I told you, dude.

34:34.909 --> 34:38.610
- I know, I know, but--
- there's that word again.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.550
It wouldn't have made any difference.

34:40.570 --> 34:42.510
I could stop myself from kissing beth.

34:42.540 --> 34:45.750
But you couldn't keep her
from having feelin for you.

34:45.760 --> 34:48.370
Fate can be changed, eli,
except for when it can'T.

34:48.400 --> 34:49.790
That's helpful. I should tell nate that.

34:49.800 --> 34:52.780
Maybe he'd hate my guts a little less.

34:55.100 --> 34:58.010
I have this
client-- a minister.

34:58.030 --> 35:02.820
He got fired, but all he really
wants is the chae to explain himself,

35:02.830 --> 35:06.490
tell his congregation
his side of the story.

35:06.500 --> 35:09.110
Then go talk to nate.

35:09.140 --> 35:11.330
Tell him your side. Explain things.

35:11.340 --> 35:15.090
I would if he'd return any of my calls.

35:17.040 --> 35:21.760
Your client, the minister-- if he told
his congregation everything he wants,

35:21.790 --> 35:23.710
is there any guarantee they'd listen?

35:23.720 --> 35:25.530
Not really.

35:25.560 --> 35:28.730
But it doesn't seem to be stopping him.

35:39.360 --> 35:41.720
You walking out with me?

35:42.360 --> 35:44.660
No.

35:44.670 --> 35:48.870
Dr. Lenz is gonna call any second
with the results from the C.V.S.

35:51.880 --> 35:55.340
I just figured since we
haven't talked about it...

35:55.350 --> 35:58.210
you went and did the
test without me, huh?

35:58.230 --> 36:02.790
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
I just-- I needed to go alone.

36:02.800 --> 36:07.280
I needed to think about... just myself.

36:07.870 --> 36:11.100
- Sounds fair.
- I'm not mad at you.

36:11.110 --> 36:16.300
I know this is difficult, and it's not
like you've ever been a father before.

36:16.310 --> 36:18.840
At least not as far as you know.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.010
Kidding.

36:21.030 --> 36:26.880
My point is that we just need to
take things one step at a time.

36:26.890 --> 36:31.710
There are gonna be a million decisions
to make and probably a million fights.

36:31.740 --> 36:34.530
Eh, I'd say a couple hundred
thousand, you know? Be optimistic.

36:34.540 --> 36:38.230
We can't collapse
every time they happen.

36:38.640 --> 36:41.440
We need to keep talking,
even if it's screaming.

36:41.450 --> 36:45.720
I like screaming. There's
makeup sex to look forward to.

36:45.730 --> 36:49.250
We're about to find out if our baby's
healthy, and you're cracking sex jokes.

36:49.280 --> 36:52.910
What, you don't think consistency's
an attractive feature in a guy?

36:57.280 --> 36:59.750
oh, my god.

37:00.610 --> 37:03.680
One step at a time, right?

37:06.650 --> 37:09.200
hello?

37:09.210 --> 37:12.340
Yes.

37:13.440 --> 37:17.260
Okay. Thank you.

37:20.590 --> 37:22.690
The baby's fine.

37:25.250 --> 37:28.000
The baby's perfect.

37:36.410 --> 37:40.690
"we, the jury, "in the matter of michael
stills "vs.St.Anne's united methodist church,

37:40.720 --> 37:45.130
"find in favor of the plaintiff
"and award him compensatory damages

37:45.160 --> 37:50.240
"totaling $50,000 and treble
damages in the amount of $125,000."

37:50.260 --> 37:53.590
i'm sorry. Did our best.

37:53.600 --> 37:58.380
Um, I know how y canavoid
writing that check.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.390
You ready for your close-up?

38:02.400 --> 38:06.010
Honestly? I'm so nervous, I'm starting
to wonder why I fought so hard for this.

38:06.020 --> 38:09.790
Just preach it like you did
in court. You'll be fine.

38:21.550 --> 38:24.600
they came for a sermon, reverend.

38:24.610 --> 38:26.820
I just thought...

38:26.840 --> 38:29.710
everybody'd come around?

38:30.770 --> 38:34.460
- They will.
- How do you know?

38:35.490 --> 38:38.080
Because I did.

39:05.730 --> 39:08.300
used my spare key.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.030
Yeah, I'm gonna need that back.

39:11.040 --> 39:14.370
You haven't answered any of my
calls, any of my texts or e-mails.

39:14.380 --> 39:16.890
You thought that meant, "come on over"?

39:17.190 --> 39:20.420
Look, is there a bigger
word than "sorry"?

39:20.440 --> 39:26.010
'Cause if there is, then I
came here to say it. I am sorry.

39:27.350 --> 39:30.960
I'm sorry that beth turned
out not to be the one.

39:31.830 --> 39:37.350
Yeah, I like how you say "turned out,"
like it just sort of happened, you know?

39:37.950 --> 39:40.710
Like it was the weather.

39:40.720 --> 39:44.740
I don't have any control
over beth's feelings, nate.

39:44.760 --> 39:47.720
Believe me, I wish that I did.

39:48.110 --> 39:50.730
but you did have a vision, didn't you?

39:51.120 --> 39:54.940
That's what all this was about,
right-- you stalking me, avoiding beth?

39:54.960 --> 39:56.120
I was trying to protect you.

39:56.140 --> 39:58.270
Oh, good goin'.

40:00.880 --> 40:04.400
You know, before you started
"protecting" me, I had a job, a career,

40:04.440 --> 40:07.760
a woman who loved me, wanted to
spend the rest of her life with me.

40:07.770 --> 40:12.330
I know it's terrible, but
it's also not my fault.

40:12.970 --> 40:16.940
That's because you can't
see what you did, eli.

40:16.960 --> 40:22.760
You knew something, and you didn't
tell me because you didn't want to.

40:22.770 --> 40:25.070
Because you probably never
wanted me to get married...

40:25.080 --> 40:28.770
- oh, that's not true.
- Because then you'd be left alone, and that terrifies you!

40:28.780 --> 40:30.680
Well, that wasn't the deal, okay?

40:30.690 --> 40:33.160
You got to be the prophet. I
got the girl, the normal life.

40:33.170 --> 40:34.630
That was my consolation prize.

40:34.650 --> 40:35.930
You know I didn't choose this, nate.

40:35.940 --> 40:38.150
- You know I didn't choose any of it!
- Yes, you did, eli!

40:38.160 --> 40:40.330
When you asked for the
aneurysm back, you chose it.

40:40.340 --> 40:43.900
- I asked for it back to save you!
- From what?

40:48.780 --> 40:51.270
If I had the aneurysm, then
at least I'd have your gift.

40:51.280 --> 40:53.920
I'd have the thing that makes you
special, allows you to see the future.

40:53.940 --> 40:57.850
But now I have no future, and
I am just as alone as you are!

40:57.860 --> 41:00.620
I don't--I didn't
want you to be alone.

41:00.640 --> 41:02.820
- I don't want you to be alone!
- And here you are.

41:02.830 --> 41:06.150
Everything I care about,
you're taking away from me.

41:07.530 --> 41:10.410
You're worse than dad.

41:13.280 --> 41:16.200
You...

41:17.370 --> 41:20.140
- You don't say that.
- Eli...

41:20.150 --> 41:24.220
look, I just need you
to forgive me, okay?

41:24.250 --> 41:26.870
You're the most important thing
in my life, and you're the--

41:26.880 --> 41:30.400
- You're the only thing that I haven't completely...
- eli. Eli!

41:30.410 --> 41:33.170
Look at me. Look at me.

41:33.670 --> 41:37.410
Here. Hold this to your nose.
I'm calling the hospital.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.790
Nate?

41:41.250 --> 41:42.970
nate?
