[Colt] <i>I gotta tell you about the craziest</i>
<i>best day of my life.</i>

00:10.385 --> 00:13.346
<i>Although I did just send in an audition</i>
<i>tape to </i>American Ninja Warrior,

00:13.430 --> 00:15.432
<i>so it might not be the best for long.</i>

00:16.558 --> 00:18.601
All right, thanks.

00:18.685 --> 00:21.146
Okay, the nurse said that my contractions
are far enough apart

00:21.229 --> 00:22.939
that we can go to our hospital.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.274
And your cramps,

00:24.357 --> 00:26.359
they're from the half-dozen
hot dogs you ate.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.611
[country & western plays on radio]

00:28.737 --> 00:32.615
Are you sure? 'Cause I was positive
that it was sympathy labor cramps.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.661
You don't wanna go to the closer hospital?

00:36.745 --> 00:39.247
No, I really want Dr. Clancy.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.291
-She's been with us the whole time.
-Okay.

00:41.374 --> 00:45.045
We could get there if this guy in front
of us would stop driving like a bitch.

00:46.337 --> 00:49.799
To be fair, his license plate frame
does say he'd rather be wakeboarding.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.885
[both sigh]

00:53.053 --> 00:54.429
Can you hand me another hot dog?

00:54.512 --> 00:56.056
You just said you had cramps!

00:56.139 --> 00:58.683
Yeah, well, there's still
more free hot dogs.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.981
All right, we should call your parents
and my parents.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.858
I don't want anyone else
in the delivery room.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.944
What? No, just you and me, okay?

01:10.028 --> 01:11.529
I don't need added stress.

01:12.113 --> 01:14.491
When I got my tonsils out
on picture day in eighth grade,

01:14.574 --> 01:16.451
my mom permed my hair when I was under.

01:16.534 --> 01:18.703
I woke up looking like
Little Orphan Annie.

01:20.038 --> 01:20.997
I remember that.

01:21.539 --> 01:24.292
I shoved you into a locker
'cause I thought you were Rooster.

01:27.629 --> 01:28.797
I'm not ready for this.

01:29.422 --> 01:32.675
We just talked about how we don't have
time to get everything done in a month.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.094
Now we don't even have a month.

01:34.677 --> 01:36.679
The baby's gonna be sleeping
in Rooster's room

01:36.763 --> 01:39.474
underneath a poster
of Danica Patrick on a GoDaddy car.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.228
-Should probably take that down.
-Yeah.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.647
Well, there is room above our bed.

01:47.607 --> 01:48.483
All right.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.026
-Look...
-[Abby sighs]

01:51.402 --> 01:53.780
maybe we haven't got done
everything we wanted to.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.700
But nobody's ever ready.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.285
We can handle this.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.038
-We'll do it together.
-All right.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.750

And I know that's from last week's
episode of <i>This Is Us.</i>

02:13.925 --> 02:16.136
Well, I believed it
when Milo Ventimiglia said it.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.639
Look, we'll be fine.

02:19.722 --> 02:20.598
Yeah.

Shit is gonna roll out
the way it's supposed to happen.

Hey, Colt, I think I saw you and Abby,

04:27.267 --> 04:30.144
but then the Fox robot
was breakdancing in front of you...

04:31.437 --> 04:32.563
What?

04:32.647 --> 04:33.773
Oh, that's so exciting.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.650
No, we'll meet you there.

04:35.733 --> 04:36.651
All right.

04:36.734 --> 04:37.902
What's goin' on?

04:37.986 --> 04:40.154
-Abby's water broke.
-Really?

04:40.238 --> 04:42.365
They're gonna have the baby.

04:42.448 --> 04:43.783
That's great.

04:43.866 --> 04:46.869
Wait, are you sure Colt
didn't just spill beer on her lap?

04:48.496 --> 04:50.623
Colt would rather drop a baby than a beer.

04:55.461 --> 04:56.546

-We're gonna be grandparents.
-[laughing] Yeah.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.260
God, can you believe it?

There's gonna be a person on this Earth

who looks at Colt and says,
"That man has all the answers."

05:11.519 --> 05:13.730
I think I wanna be called "Pop Pop."

05:14.355 --> 05:16.566
Because that's the sound you hear
at a firing range.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.029
Oh!

05:22.905 --> 05:24.032
What the fuck?

05:26.701 --> 05:28.536
D'you think there's a fence down?

05:29.203 --> 05:32.749
Or did they figure out what you're doing
to them and they're fighting back?

05:33.624 --> 05:36.210
You go on to the hospital,
I'll see what's goin' on.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.629
-Jesus.
-All right, but hurry up.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.883
Be there as soon as I can, Grandma.

Yeah.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.518
Our regular doctor's not here.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.687
So we get this backup doctor
who says she's at two centimeters,

06:36.771 --> 06:39.065

he's a fuckin' Canadian.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.901
Everything's gonna go fine.

06:41.984 --> 06:42.985
You don't know that.

like, then what?

06:47.323 --> 06:49.409
Okay, they're gonna hand me
this little person

06:49.492 --> 06:51.327
and say, "Good luck. Try not to kill it."

06:51.411 --> 06:54.414
And I'll try, like I tried with those
three hamsters when I was a kid.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.750
No, there were seven.
We had to swap out a few.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.168
Oh my God!

06:59.794 --> 07:02.338
You told me that hamsters
change color sometimes.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.007
And I believed you until, like, right now.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.343
It's totally normal to feel anxious.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.679
Okay, I'm not ready to be a dad.

07:09.762 --> 07:10.847
I'm not.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.475
We went to our birthing class and they
showed a video of women breastfeeding.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.019
I'm the only one who laughed
when you could see their boobs.

07:18.062 --> 07:18.980
Oh, I get that.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.566
I was terrified when I was pregnant
with Rooster.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.651
I had just discovered Quaaludes.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.988
But, you know,
it'll all change when you see her.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.949
What if it doesn't change?

07:30.032 --> 07:31.826
Oh, it will, trust me.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.244
You'll stop worrying about this

07:33.327 --> 07:35.955
and you'll start worrying
about <i>everything</i> else.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.331
What?

07:37.999 --> 07:39.292
Well,

07:39.375 --> 07:42.920
your whole life is gonna be a dance
between love and fear.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.674
Again, I'm gonna go with "What?"

07:49.343 --> 07:51.721
You're gonna love your daughter
so completely.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.432
And because of that...

07:55.308 --> 07:57.935
you're gonna be afraid
of every bad thing in the world.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.147
So I'm just gonna be afraid

08:01.230 --> 08:02.690
for the rest of my life?

08:02.899 --> 08:06.527
[laughs] We were afraid
every time you guys got in a car,

08:07.236 --> 08:09.447
every time you missed curfew
by five minutes,

08:09.530 --> 08:12.867
every time that phone rang
after midnight, yeah.

08:13.701 --> 08:14.994
That just sounds terrible.

08:15.536 --> 08:17.580
Well, that's just the beginning,

08:17.663 --> 08:20.666
'cause she's gonna have friends
and some of them you're not gonna like.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.460
Some of them are gonna be boys.

08:23.252 --> 08:25.087
She's gonna get hurt, she's gonna cry

08:25.171 --> 08:27.089
and there won't
be a damn thing you can do to--

08:27.173 --> 08:28.257
What the fuck?!

08:28.341 --> 08:29.342
Yeah.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.219
It's called being a parent.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.847
So far you're doing great, though.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.350
I can't... I just... I can't...

08:37.433 --> 08:40.186
I need to go take a walk and clear my...

08:40.269 --> 08:42.355
All right,
that's the best thing you can do.

08:43.898 --> 08:47.443
Well, the best thing you could do is take
a Quaalude, but that ship has sailed.

09:00.998 --> 09:01.874
Hey, Beau.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.793
What are you guys doin' out here?

09:04.794 --> 09:09.131
Maggie called and said Abby went
into labor and you have some cows loose.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.009
I figured you guys
wanted me for the delivery,

09:12.093 --> 09:15.304
but apparently, Abby had her heart set
on a people doctor.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.057
I appreciate you comin'.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.600
This isn't your problem.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.894
It's not a problem. We're your friends.

09:23.062 --> 09:23.938
Right?

09:25.398 --> 09:26.983
Of course we are!

09:27.066 --> 09:28.943
Friends help friends out.

09:29.485 --> 09:32.697
Friends also compliment friends
on their new shirt.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.117
Friends also don't lie to each other.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.244
You put me in a real pickle.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.665
I already got my cattle together.

09:44.250 --> 09:48.004
But I do have a piece of fence
to restring, if you wanna help.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.215
We'll take care of the fence.
You just get on to the hospital.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.718
I'm not going anywhere
till the job's done.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.803
You got more important places to be.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.555
They don't need me there.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.807
Besides, how are you gonna fix my fence?

09:59.890 --> 10:02.143
You got winded climbing outta your truck.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.854
Oh, bullshit.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.028
You don't believe me, come at me.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.365
I was taught never to hit my elders.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.578
I'm not goin' anywhere
till the job's done.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.413
[sighs] All right.

10:22.496 --> 10:23.497
Let's go.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.708
We know the rules.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.502
We do it your way and no talkin'.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.671
And no fuckin' whisperin'.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.757
Oh, sure,

10:32.840 --> 10:35.217
"Dock of the Bay" brought joy to millions,

10:35.301 --> 10:36.719
yet I'm the asshole.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.056
Your words, not mine.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.853
<i>I</i> like your shirt.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.521
Thank you.

10:50.399 --> 10:51.359
Hey!

10:51.776 --> 10:53.402
Mary, what are you doing here?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.404
Hank told me Abby was in labor.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.865
I thought he was trying to trick me
into leaving the bar early

10:57.948 --> 10:59.241
so he could drink for free.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.452
Then I texted Colt
and I knew the baby was coming

11:01.535 --> 11:04.580
when he sent me back a video of a kid
shooting out of a water slide.

11:06.123 --> 11:09.293
Yeah, he sent me one of a tennis ball
flying out of ball machine.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.796
Anyway, I thought y'all might be hungry,

11:11.879 --> 11:15.091
so I took some of the food that was going
bad at the bar and I fried it all up.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.885
I figured worst case,
we are at a hospital.

11:19.428 --> 11:22.014
Well, thank you Mary,
although I already ate so I prob--

11:22.098 --> 11:23.140
Ooh, wings!

11:24.016 --> 11:26.310
Hey, Mary, can I talk to you
about something?

11:26.394 --> 11:28.187
-Of course, yeah.
-Thanks again, Mar--

11:29.188 --> 11:31.148
Did you happen to bring anything to drink?

11:31.232 --> 11:32.733
Yeah, I threw some waters in there.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.985
Oh, water, great.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.154
'Cause they don't have that here.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.200
What's up?

11:41.909 --> 11:43.077
I called Maria.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.328
Really? Why?

11:44.412 --> 11:46.872
'Cause she's a friend of mine
and I figured if she stole from me

11:46.956 --> 11:48.374
it must have been for a good reason.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.419
She had no idea what I was talking about.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.045
She said you fired her.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.423
That I said I couldn't afford
to keep her on.

11:55.673 --> 11:56.507
Oh.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.428
Okay, I don't mean to be insensitive,

12:00.928 --> 12:02.638
but she got caught stealing.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.640
I mean, what else is she gonna say?

12:05.224 --> 12:07.143
When I accused my ex-husband of cheating,

12:07.226 --> 12:09.645
he did not say,
"Oh, busted. Here, take half my stuff.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.772
You might want to get tested
for chlamydia."

12:13.816 --> 12:17.403
She's worked for me for over ten years.
She's never lied to me once.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.531
Yeah, some people
are just really good liars.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.032
Yeah.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.201
Yeah, sure.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.662
It's just, none of it makes sense, so...

12:26.746 --> 12:30.499
Maggie, you do not need to be worried
about this stuff today, of all days.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.376
Yeah.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.336
Colt's about to be a father.

12:34.920 --> 12:35.963
Exactly.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.048
That is what we should all
be worried about.

12:42.511 --> 12:43.429
[porter] Excuse me.

12:44.096 --> 12:44.972
Colt!

12:45.055 --> 12:45.931
[porter] Excuse me.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.017
What's going on?
Where they taking you?

12:48.100 --> 12:49.602
[Maggie] I was just trying to call you.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.480
The baby's heart rate dropped.
They said I need an emergency C-section.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.815
What the hell?
I thought you said she was in good hands.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.233
She is. We'll take care of her.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.152
-Colt...
-I'll be by your side the whole time.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.820
You're not allowed
in the operating room.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.114
-What the fuck?!
-I'm sorry, it's hospital policy.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.325
Okay, babe, I'll be right here
when you get back, okay?

13:04.408 --> 13:06.410
-[Abby] I love you.
-I love you.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.089
[Maggie] Hey, buddy.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.342
Hey.

13:21.425 --> 13:24.470
Everybody's in the waiting room.
They're asking about you.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.685
It's the first thing Abby bought
when she found out she was pregnant.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.983
Colt, they have really good doctors here.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.945
She's gonna get great care.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.407
Heather had good doctors.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.243
Oh, honey, that was different.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.245
That was a miscarriage, y'know.

13:49.954 --> 13:53.541
C-sections, even emergency C-sections,
are really common.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.419
I looked up emergency C-sections on WebMD.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.755
There's like 100 things
that could go wrong.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.384
Yeah, well, you need to focus
on what you <i>can </i>control.

14:03.467 --> 14:07.471
Like, "If I look up WebMD again,
my mom's gonna smash my phone."

14:12.017 --> 14:13.394
Couldn't do anythin' about Heather.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.732
Couldn't do anythin' about Rooster.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.570
Now I can't do anythin' about Abby.

14:26.782 --> 14:27.992
[quietly] She's back there...

14:29.451 --> 14:30.703
with my daughter.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.162
Hey.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.455
It's gonna be all right.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.416
Come on, now.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.590
[Colt sighs]

14:45.509 --> 14:48.470
If they don't come out in five minutes,
I'm goin' back there.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.763
I don't care what they say.

14:49.847 --> 14:53.350
Yeah, that's just what we need, Colt,
you helping out in the operating room.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.854
Can I get anybody anything?

14:56.937 --> 15:00.274
You can get someone to walk in here and
tell me what's going on with my daughter.

15:01.525 --> 15:02.693
I need a Xanax.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.236
Anyone else?

15:04.904 --> 15:06.238
Yeah, sure, I'll take one.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.991
-Hospitals stress me out.
-Great.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.285
Call it even for the water you brought.

15:13.537 --> 15:14.663
[Maggie] Dr. Hopkins.

15:15.664 --> 15:18.208
-[Colt] What's goin' on?
-Abby and your baby girl are doing great.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.003
[Colt] Ah, gee... bring it in, bitch!

15:21.086 --> 15:22.922
Watch out, he's a kisser.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.090
What happened?

15:25.174 --> 15:27.343
The umbilical cord was wrapped
around her neck,

15:27.426 --> 15:29.178
which caused the heart rate to drop.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.597
-But she's okay.
-Yeah.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.974
They're in recovery.
You can see them in a couple minutes.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.435
Thank you.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.270
Congratulations.

15:38.354 --> 15:39.521
That's great.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.148
I'm a dad.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.317
I'm so happy for you.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.570
I'm also so happy you never said that
to me in high school.

15:57.665 --> 15:58.582
There's my girls.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.042
[softly] Hi, sweetie.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.466
[breathes anxiously]

16:08.509 --> 16:09.718
[Colt's breathing wavers]

16:12.554 --> 16:13.806
Oh, jeez.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.476
You did so great.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.187
[Colt laughs nervously]

16:21.105 --> 16:22.523
-She's so beautiful.
-[laughs gently]

16:24.024 --> 16:25.442
Oh, she really is.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.529
Are you ready to hold her?

16:31.573 --> 16:33.033
[both laugh quietly]

16:33.575 --> 16:34.952
-All right.
-Okay.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.830
Here we go, Bennett. One time, no fumbles.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.250
[baby gurgles]

16:45.337 --> 16:46.422
Hi, little lady.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.261
I'm your dad.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.269
I'm so happy you're finally here.

17:00.602 --> 17:01.437
[Abby chuckles]

17:02.730 --> 17:04.648
We're gonna have so much fun together.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.985
I'm gonna be there
for your first day of school...

17:10.446 --> 17:11.989
first time you lose a tooth...

17:13.782 --> 17:15.200
your first boyfriend.

17:15.993 --> 17:16.869
[Abby moans quietly]

17:17.661 --> 17:18.704
I'm gonna hate him.

17:19.538 --> 17:22.291
Your mom's gonna say,
"Come on, give him a chance."

17:23.083 --> 17:25.502
I'm gonna say, "Okay, if you like him,
I like him," but...

17:26.545 --> 17:27.629
I ain't gonna like him.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.756
[Abby chuckles]

17:33.093 --> 17:34.261
I'm gonna love you.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.307
Forever...

17:38.974 --> 17:39.850
and ever.

17:41.518 --> 17:42.895
She's got your hair.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.400
I got so much to teach you
about hair care. [chuckles]

17:51.028 --> 17:52.029
I almost forgot.

17:52.696 --> 17:53.572
All right.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.325
Let's get you all wrapped up.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.286
Okay.

18:01.830 --> 18:04.541
-I'm doin' it.
-You're doin' it so good.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.504
Okay. Okay.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.343
Mama got you this blanket.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.056
First thing after she found out
she was havin' you.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.058
We make cute babies, Bennett.

18:22.893 --> 18:23.894
Yeah, we do.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.522
[whispering] Wow.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.067
Look at this.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.068
Mm-hm.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.528
This is our family.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.447
This is us.

18:35.697 --> 18:36.698
[Abby sighs]

18:37.032 --> 18:38.617
Okay, I didn't even mean that one.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.413
I love you.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.374
I love you, too.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.052
[Colt exhales]

18:59.096 --> 18:59.972
I'm sorry...

19:02.558 --> 19:05.894
I wasn't here when you found out
you were havin' a C-section.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.438
[sniffs] I just, um...

19:09.648 --> 19:11.108
went out to get some air.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.903
I saw a Dairy Queen
so I went and got you a Blizzard.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.072
Oh, none of that matters now.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.451
The only thing that matters
is that we're together.

19:22.786 --> 19:23.996
And we're happy.

19:24.913 --> 19:27.040
And healthy. Hmm?

19:27.833 --> 19:30.335
And somewhere in this room
there's a Blizzard.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.005
I'll get this. It's right over here.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.673
-What kind did you get?
-Er...

19:36.967 --> 19:38.218
I don't know.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.721
I just... I got there
and realized I didn't have my wallet

19:40.804 --> 19:43.015
so I just stole it from some little kid.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.560
-You did that for me?
-Yeah.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.061
You're gonna be a great dad.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.691
Mmm. Oh.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.195
Mmm. So good.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.779
-Wanna trade?
-Oh, yeah.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.283
-Got her?
-Yeah.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.242
Okay.

-[Abby chuckles]
-Oh, ho, ho, ho!

20:04.786 --> 20:06.079
Oh. Ah...

20:11.335 --> 20:12.502
[softly] I love you.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.010
I wonder if they've picked a name yet.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.221
Janice, do you know?

20:22.638 --> 20:23.639
I made her a list.

20:24.514 --> 20:27.100
I'm partial to "Janice"
because it's a beautiful name,

20:27.184 --> 20:29.561
or "Helen" because it's a family name,

20:29.645 --> 20:31.438
or "Dolly" because...

20:32.147 --> 20:33.357
well, come on,

20:33.440 --> 20:35.025
Dolly "GG" Parton.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.778
I just hope it's somethin' normal.

20:37.861 --> 20:41.657
Everyone names their kid "Orange"
or some shit these days.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.872
Who wants to meet their granddaughter?

20:48.956 --> 20:51.458
Yes, I've been waiting 40 years

20:51.541 --> 20:52.876
for a Bennett girl,

20:53.418 --> 20:55.921
and finally somebody
I can watch <i>This Is Us</i> with.

20:57.839 --> 20:58.840
I've never seen it.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.468

all right.

-Really?
-Yeah.

so I'm gonna get going.

[baby gurgles]

24:57.078 --> 24:58.997

25:00.999 --> 25:02.125
This is...

25:03.752 --> 25:05.295
Rooster Peyton Bennett.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.757
Nah, I'm just messing with ya.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.634
We didn't name her fuckin' "Rooster."

25:11.510 --> 25:14.888
Oh, hey, don't you tell your mom
I swore in front of ya, all right?

25:16.806 --> 25:17.891

25:32.030 --> 25:33.615

25:34.533 --> 25:36.159

25:38.036 --> 25:39.579
As soon as I saw Peyton...

25:42.999 --> 25:44.417
I heard your voice...

25:45.418 --> 25:47.295
sayin', "You ain't gonna be a bad dad.

25:48.296 --> 25:49.965
You're gonna be a badass dad."

-Oop! Oh! [chuckles]

25:57.847 --> 26:00.058
She let one loose there, bud.

26:00.141 --> 26:01.309
That was for you.

26:02.018 --> 26:03.645
Er, almost forgot.

26:05.939 --> 26:07.774
It's your "Rooster's Daughter."

26:12.946 --> 26:13.863
