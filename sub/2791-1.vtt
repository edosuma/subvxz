00:33.073 --> 00:35.990
Two households, both alike in dignity...

00:36.076 --> 00:39.279
...in fair Verona, where we lay our scene...

00:39.371 --> 00:42.574
...from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny...

00:42.666 --> 00:45.916
...where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

00:46.003 --> 00:48.873
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

00:48.964 --> 00:52.084
...a pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;

00:52.176 --> 00:54.845
...whose misadventured piteous overthrows...

00:54.929 --> 00:58.262
...doth with their death
bury their parents' strife.

00:58.349 --> 01:01.220
The fearful passage
of their death-mark'd love...

01:01.310 --> 01:04.098
...and the continuance
of their parents' rage...

01:04.188 --> 01:08.103
...which, but their children's end,
nought could remove...

01:08.193 --> 01:10.944
...is now the two hours' traffic of our stage.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.343
Two households...

01:33.427 --> 01:35.586
...both alike in dignity...

01:35.680 --> 01:39.298
...in fair Verona, where we lay our scene...

01:39.392 --> 01:44.599
...from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny...

01:44.689 --> 01:49.186
...where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

01:51.279 --> 01:56.784
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

01:57.870 --> 02:02.995
...a pair of star-cross'd lovers
take their life.

02:40.414 --> 02:45.409
A dog of the house of Capulet
moves me!

02:45.503 --> 02:47.579
(rap music on car radio)

02:51.968 --> 02:54.044
Pedlar's excrement!

02:54.137 --> 02:57.553
King Urinal! Go rot!

02:58.183 --> 03:00.222
(radio) â™ª The boys! The boys!

03:14.366 --> 03:18.281
- The quarrel is between our masters.
- And us their men!

03:19.121 --> 03:20.117
(laughs) Ahh!

03:38.141 --> 03:40.217
(girls giggling)

03:42.145 --> 03:46.439
Hubble, bubble, toil and trouble!

03:46.525 --> 03:50.653
(both chanting)
And I am a pretty piece of flesh!

03:50.738 --> 03:52.280
I am...

03:53.824 --> 03:57.110
...a pretty piece of flesh!

03:57.203 --> 03:58.033
(gasps)

04:01.708 --> 04:05.575
- Here comes of the house of Capulet!
- Quarrel, I will back thee.

04:12.761 --> 04:13.377
Huh?

04:15.806 --> 04:17.845
- Boo!
- (laughing)

04:21.228 --> 04:22.971
(laughing)

04:26.483 --> 04:30.102
I will bite my thumb at them, which is
a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

04:47.464 --> 04:49.255
Go forth! I will back thee!

04:51.468 --> 04:54.386
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
- I... I do bite my thumb, sir.

04:54.471 --> 04:56.630
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

04:56.723 --> 04:59.262
- Is the law of our side if I say ay?
- No!

04:59.351 --> 05:02.555
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,
but I bite my thumb, sir!

05:02.646 --> 05:05.683
- Do you quarrel, sir?
- Quarrel, sir? No, sir!

05:05.775 --> 05:08.811
But if you do, sir, I am for you.
I serve as good a man as you.

05:08.903 --> 05:10.896
- No better?
- Uh... uh...

05:10.988 --> 05:13.111
Here comes our kinsman. Say better!

05:13.199 --> 05:15.026
- Yes, sir, better!
- You lie!

05:15.618 --> 05:17.278
Draw, if you be men!

05:17.370 --> 05:19.327
(women scream)

05:20.915 --> 05:22.789
Part, fools! You know not what you do.

05:30.259 --> 05:31.836
Put up your Swords!

06:02.834 --> 06:06.168
What, art thou drawn
among these... heartless hinds?

06:08.215 --> 06:10.124
Turn thee, Benvolio...

06:11.385 --> 06:14.137
...and look upon thy death.

06:15.181 --> 06:17.257
I do but keep the peace.

06:17.350 --> 06:19.389
Put up thy Sword...

06:19.477 --> 06:22.098
...or manage it to part these men with me.

06:22.355 --> 06:24.431
Peace?

06:24.899 --> 06:26.808
Peace?

06:26.901 --> 06:28.977
I hate the word...

06:30.321 --> 06:32.065
...as I hate hell...

06:32.157 --> 06:33.948
...all Montagues...

06:37.954 --> 06:39.034
...and thee.

06:39.122 --> 06:40.581
(boy) Bang bang!

06:42.417 --> 06:43.117
Bang.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.176
(yelling)

07:15.494 --> 07:17.533
- Come forth! Come!
- Wait!

07:22.668 --> 07:24.826
Come forth!

07:28.966 --> 07:29.880
(gunshots)

07:39.435 --> 07:40.978
Agh!

07:54.743 --> 07:56.617
(car horns)

08:21.438 --> 08:23.893
(helicopter)

08:31.740 --> 08:34.231
(TV) From ancient grudge
break to new mutiny...

08:39.582 --> 08:40.447
Do not proceed!

08:47.757 --> 08:49.833
Give me my Longsword, ho!

08:49.926 --> 08:52.631
Thou shalt not stir one foot
to seek a foe.

09:00.854 --> 09:02.728
(Prince) Rebellious subjects...

09:02.814 --> 09:04.606
...enemies to peace!

09:04.691 --> 09:06.850
Throw your mistemper'd weapons
to the ground!

09:08.529 --> 09:10.356
On pain of torture...

09:10.447 --> 09:15.442
...from those bloody hands throw your
mistemper'd weapons to the ground!

09:16.954 --> 09:19.528
Three civil brawls...

09:19.624 --> 09:23.372
...bred of an airy word by thee,
old Capulet, and Montague...

09:23.461 --> 09:26.498
...have thrice disturbed
the quiet of our streets.

09:27.715 --> 09:31.049
If ever you disturb our streets again...

09:31.761 --> 09:35.296
...your lives shall pay
the forfeit of the peace.

09:49.655 --> 09:52.193
O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?

09:53.284 --> 09:56.036
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

09:56.871 --> 09:59.706
Madam, underneath the Grove
of Sycamore...

09:59.791 --> 10:02.626
...so early walking did I see your son.

10:02.710 --> 10:04.999
Many a morning
hath he there been seen...

10:05.088 --> 10:08.124
...with tears augmenting
the fresh morning's dew.

10:08.216 --> 10:11.632
Away from light
steals home my heavy son...

10:11.720 --> 10:15.171
...and private in his chamber
pens himself...

10:15.265 --> 10:17.341
...shuts up his windows...

10:17.434 --> 10:22.429
...locks fair daylight out, and
makes himself an artificial night.

10:33.451 --> 10:35.029
Why, then...

10:35.119 --> 10:39.367
...O brawling love, O loving hate!

10:40.208 --> 10:43.708
O anything of nothing first create!

10:43.795 --> 10:45.704
Heavy lightness...

10:45.797 --> 10:47.873
...serious vanity.

10:48.842 --> 10:52.045
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms.

11:41.105 --> 11:44.640
Black and portentous
must this humour prove...

11:46.736 --> 11:49.772
...unless good counsel
may the cause remove.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.776
So please you, step aside.

11:56.371 --> 11:59.574
I'll know his grievance
or be much denied.

12:00.292 --> 12:02.368
Come, madam, let's away.

12:16.642 --> 12:18.718
Good morrow, cousin.

12:19.645 --> 12:21.722
Is the day so young?

12:21.814 --> 12:23.973
But new struck, coz.

12:24.734 --> 12:26.810
Ay me, sad hours seem long.

12:30.198 --> 12:32.736
Was that my father that went hence so fast?

12:32.826 --> 12:34.949
It was.

12:35.037 --> 12:36.780
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

12:36.872 --> 12:39.030
Not having that
which having makes them short.

12:39.124 --> 12:40.405
- In love?
- Out.

12:40.501 --> 12:42.873
- Of love?
- Out of her favour where I am in love.

12:42.962 --> 12:45.085
Alas that love,
so gentle in his view...

12:45.172 --> 12:47.498
...should be so tyrannous
and rough in proof.

12:47.591 --> 12:50.165
Alas that love,
whose view is muffled still...

12:50.261 --> 12:53.013
...should without eyes
see pathways to his will.

12:53.097 --> 12:55.090
Where shall we dine?

12:55.183 --> 12:56.132
(TV)... this costly blood.

12:56.225 --> 12:59.511
Never anger made good guard for itself.

12:59.604 --> 13:00.767
The law hath not been dead...

13:00.855 --> 13:02.848
O me! What fray was here?

13:02.941 --> 13:05.348
- Coz, I...
- Yet tell me not, for I've heard it all.

13:05.443 --> 13:08.113
Here's much to do with hate,
but more with love.

13:08.196 --> 13:10.522
Why, then, O brawling love,
O loving hate!

13:10.615 --> 13:12.608
O anything of nothing first create!

13:12.701 --> 13:15.322
O heavy lightness, serious vanity!

13:15.412 --> 13:18.117
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!

13:18.207 --> 13:20.330
- Feather of lead, br...
- (chuckles)

13:21.627 --> 13:23.703
Dost thou not laugh?

13:24.088 --> 13:26.128
No, coz, I rather weep.

13:26.215 --> 13:28.291
Good heart, at what?

13:28.593 --> 13:31.962
- At thy good heart's oppression.
- Farewell, my coz.

13:32.055 --> 13:36.005
Soft, I will go along. And if you
leave me so, you do me wrong.

13:43.692 --> 13:47.227
But Montague is bound as well as l,
in penalty alike.

13:47.321 --> 13:50.939
And 'tis not hard, I think, for men
as old as we to keep the peace.

13:51.033 --> 13:54.532
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
and pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.945
But now, my lord,
what say you to my suit?

13:57.039 --> 14:02.200
But saying o'er what I have said before:
my child is yet a stranger in the world.

14:02.295 --> 14:06.458
Let two more summers wither in their pride
ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

14:06.549 --> 14:08.423
Younger than she are happy mothers made.

14:08.509 --> 14:11.879
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.

14:12.055 --> 14:14.427
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast.

14:14.516 --> 14:17.054
At my poor house look to behold this night...

14:17.143 --> 14:20.762
...fresh female buds
that make dark heaven light.

14:21.356 --> 14:23.432
Hear all, all see...

14:23.525 --> 14:26.562
...and like her most
whose merit most shall be.

14:26.653 --> 14:28.231
Come, go with me.

14:29.406 --> 14:31.732
Tell me in sadness,
who is it that you love?

14:31.825 --> 14:33.984
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

14:34.078 --> 14:37.079
I aim'd so near when I supposed you loved.

14:37.665 --> 14:40.286
A right good marksman!
And she's fair I love.

14:40.376 --> 14:43.543
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

14:44.505 --> 14:47.957
Well, in that hit you miss.
She'll not be hit with Cupid's arrow;

14:48.051 --> 14:50.542
...nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes...

14:50.637 --> 14:53.128
...nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.

14:53.223 --> 14:56.010
Then she hath sworn
that she will still live chaste?

14:56.101 --> 14:58.806
She hath, and in that sparing
makes huge waste.

14:58.895 --> 15:02.644
- Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.
- Teach me how I should forget to think.

15:02.733 --> 15:05.687
By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
Examine other beauties.

15:06.487 --> 15:08.479
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

15:08.572 --> 15:11.277
Not mad,
but bound more than a madman is.

15:11.367 --> 15:14.701
Shut up in prison, kept without
my food, whipp'd and tormented.

15:14.787 --> 15:15.736
Good day, good fellow.

15:18.541 --> 15:20.368
(TV) Now, I'll tell you without asking.

15:20.460 --> 15:24.078
The great rich Capulet
holds an old accustom'd feast.

15:24.172 --> 15:27.256
A fair assembly. Signor Placentio
and his wife and daughters...

15:27.342 --> 15:32.051
...the lady widow of Utruvio, mmm,
and her lovely nieces Rosaline...

15:32.139 --> 15:35.056
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
sups the fair Rosaline...

15:35.142 --> 15:37.680
...whom thou so loves, with
all the admired beauties of Verona.

15:37.769 --> 15:41.850
If you be not of the House of Montague,
come and crush a cup of wine!

15:41.941 --> 15:44.313
Go thither, and with unattainted eye...

15:44.401 --> 15:47.237
...compare her face with some
that I shall show...

15:47.321 --> 15:50.156
...and I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.814
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown...

15:52.910 --> 15:55.615
...but to rejoice in splendour of mine own.

16:01.086 --> 16:04.786
Juliet!

16:07.426 --> 16:08.671
Juliet!

16:09.011 --> 16:10.884
Juliet!

16:11.680 --> 16:12.711
Juliet!

16:13.056 --> 16:14.088
(gasps) Oh!

16:15.559 --> 16:17.018
Ooh!

16:19.813 --> 16:20.928
(elevator pings)

16:21.482 --> 16:22.893
Nurse!

16:22.983 --> 16:25.190
Nurse, where's my daughter?
Call her forth to me.

16:25.278 --> 16:27.151
I bade her come. God forbid!

16:28.906 --> 16:30.864
Julieta!

16:35.205 --> 16:36.319
Juliet!

16:37.582 --> 16:39.290
Juliet!

16:41.461 --> 16:44.996
Juliet!

16:45.090 --> 16:47.248
Madam, I am here. What is your will?

16:50.179 --> 16:53.133
O nurse, give us leave awhile.
We must talk in secret.

16:54.975 --> 16:58.391
Nurse, come back again!
I have remembered me.

16:58.479 --> 17:00.472
Thou's hear our counsel.

17:00.564 --> 17:03.850
Nurse, thou knowest
my daughter's of a pretty age.

17:03.943 --> 17:06.232
Thou wast the prettiest babe
that e'er I nursed.

17:06.320 --> 17:09.440
By my count, I was your mother
much upon these years.

17:11.617 --> 17:13.694
You are now a maid.

17:13.787 --> 17:15.863
Thus then in brief!

17:16.540 --> 17:19.540
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

17:20.001 --> 17:22.078
A man, young lady!

17:22.170 --> 17:25.789
Lady, such a man as all the world.
Why, he's a man of wax!

17:25.883 --> 17:28.421
Verona's summer hath not such a flower...

17:28.510 --> 17:30.717
Nay, he's a flower. In faith, a very flower...

17:30.804 --> 17:31.800
Nurse!

17:31.889 --> 17:33.798
This night you shall behold him at our feast.

17:33.891 --> 17:37.391
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face
and find delight writ there...

17:37.478 --> 17:39.056
...with beauty's pen.

17:39.147 --> 17:43.144
This... precious book of love,
this unbound lover...

17:43.234 --> 17:45.808
...to beautify him, only lacks a cover.

17:45.904 --> 17:48.655
So shall you share all that he doth possess...

17:48.740 --> 17:51.741
...by having him making yourself no less.

17:53.328 --> 17:55.368
Nay, bigger. Women grow by men.

17:57.374 --> 17:58.121
Oh!

18:03.339 --> 18:05.960
Speak briefly, could you like of Paris's love?

18:06.050 --> 18:09.086
I'll look to like, if looking liking move.

18:09.178 --> 18:11.336
But no more deep will I endart mine eye...

18:11.430 --> 18:14.052
...than your consent gives strength
to make it fly.

18:15.643 --> 18:16.722
(door opens)

18:17.395 --> 18:18.889
Madam, the guests are come.

18:18.980 --> 18:20.225
Go!

18:20.315 --> 18:21.857
We follow thee.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.230
Juliet! Ugh!

18:32.035 --> 18:35.369
Go, girl. Seek happy nights to happy days.

18:46.592 --> 18:47.790
(explosion)

18:49.345 --> 18:52.346
(â™ª "Angel")

19:23.798 --> 19:25.956
You taffeta punk!

19:26.050 --> 19:28.339
- Die a beggar!
- (laughing)

19:31.639 --> 19:35.139
(â™ª "Young Hearts Run Free")

19:39.272 --> 19:41.265
(laughing)

19:41.358 --> 19:43.434
(whooping)

19:48.115 --> 19:49.989
â™ª Sharing this one and only life

19:50.075 --> 19:54.369
â™ª Ending up just another
lost and lonely wife

19:54.455 --> 19:55.783
â™ª You count up the years

19:55.873 --> 19:59.823
â™ª And they will be filled with tears

20:02.296 --> 20:04.206
â™ª Young hearts

20:04.298 --> 20:06.540
â™ª Run free

20:06.634 --> 20:07.548
â™ª Never be hung up

20:09.387 --> 20:12.922
â™ª Like Rosaline and thee

20:14.351 --> 20:16.924
Nay, gentle Romeo,
we must have you dance.

20:17.020 --> 20:18.514
Not I. Not l, believe me.

20:18.605 --> 20:22.105
You have dancing shoes with
nimble soles. I have a soul of lead.

20:22.192 --> 20:23.521
You are a lover.

20:23.610 --> 20:26.315
Borrow Cupid's wings and soar
with them above a common bound.

20:26.405 --> 20:28.694
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

20:29.450 --> 20:32.321
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

20:32.411 --> 20:34.036
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough...

20:34.121 --> 20:37.075
...too rude, too boisterous,
and it pricks like thorn.

20:37.166 --> 20:39.373
If love be rough with you, be rough with love.

20:39.460 --> 20:42.414
Prick love for pricking,
and you beat love down.

20:44.382 --> 20:46.873
Every man, betake him to his legs!

20:46.968 --> 20:49.839
Come, we burn daylight, ho! Ho-o!

20:49.930 --> 20:51.210
(all) Ho-o!

20:51.306 --> 20:54.390
- But 'tis no wit to go!
- Why, may one ask?

20:54.476 --> 20:56.552
- I dreamt a dream tonight.
- And so did I.

20:56.645 --> 20:59.101
- And what was yours?
- That dreamers often lie.

20:59.189 --> 21:01.763
In bed asleep,
while they do dream things true.

21:01.859 --> 21:05.559
O! Then I see
Queen Mab hath been with you.

21:06.405 --> 21:08.197
She is the fairies' midwife...

21:08.282 --> 21:11.236
...and she comes in shape
no bigger than an agate-stone...

21:11.327 --> 21:14.613
...on the forefinger of an alderman...

21:14.706 --> 21:18.324
...drawn with a team of little atomies...

21:19.210 --> 21:22.247
...over men's noses as they lie asleep.

21:23.048 --> 21:26.298
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut...

21:27.344 --> 21:31.092
...her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat.

21:31.181 --> 21:36.721
And in this state she gallops
night by night through lovers' brains...

21:36.812 --> 21:38.888
...and then they dream of...

21:39.815 --> 21:40.930
...love;

21:41.025 --> 21:44.310
...o'er lawyers' fingers,
who straight dream on fees.

21:44.403 --> 21:46.977
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck...

21:47.073 --> 21:50.358
...and then dreams he
of cutting foreign throats;

21:50.451 --> 21:54.401
...and, being thus frighted, swears
a prayer or two, and sleeps again.

21:54.497 --> 21:58.542
This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs...

21:58.626 --> 22:02.755
...that presses them
and learns them first to bear...

22:02.839 --> 22:06.339
...making them women of good carriage!

22:06.426 --> 22:07.969
This is she!

22:08.428 --> 22:11.264
This is she!

22:23.236 --> 22:25.193
Peace, good Mercutio, peace!

22:26.280 --> 22:28.357
Thou talk'st of nothing.

22:30.827 --> 22:32.903
True.

22:34.956 --> 22:37.032
I talk of dreams...

22:37.125 --> 22:40.375
...which are the children of an idle brain...

22:40.462 --> 22:43.214
...begot of nothing but vain fantasy;

22:43.298 --> 22:48.340
...which is as thin of substance as the air
and more inconstant than the wind...

22:48.429 --> 22:51.346
...who woos even now
the frozen bosom of the north...

22:51.432 --> 22:54.219
...and, being angered,
puffs away from thence...

22:54.310 --> 22:57.062
...turning aside to the dew-dropping south.

22:57.146 --> 23:00.266
This wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves!

23:00.358 --> 23:03.478
Supper is done, and we shall come too late!

23:03.736 --> 23:05.812
I fear, too early.

23:05.905 --> 23:11.611
For my mind misgives some... consequence,
yet hanging in the stars...

23:12.996 --> 23:17.160
...shall bitterly begin his fearful date
with this night's revels...

23:17.250 --> 23:19.327
...and expire the term...

23:19.419 --> 23:23.369
...of a despised life closed within my breast...

23:25.175 --> 23:28.295
...by some vile forfeit of untimely death.

23:30.181 --> 23:32.886
But he that hath the steerage of my course...

23:34.268 --> 23:36.012
...direct my sail!

23:48.450 --> 23:50.324
(Romeo) On, lusty gentlemen!

23:50.660 --> 23:57.957
â™ª Young hearts

23:59.503 --> 24:06.122
â™ª Run free

24:27.908 --> 24:29.022
Grr!

24:29.117 --> 24:30.991
Thy drugs are quick.

24:34.331 --> 24:36.407
â™ª Young hearts

24:36.500 --> 24:38.409
â™ª Run free

24:38.502 --> 24:40.246
â™ª Never be hung up

24:40.337 --> 24:42.626
â™ª Hung up like my man and me

24:45.176 --> 24:46.255
â™ª Mm...

24:46.344 --> 24:48.135
â™ª And me

24:49.597 --> 24:51.839
â™ª Young hearts

24:51.933 --> 24:54.091
â™ª To yourself be true

24:54.185 --> 24:55.893
â™ª Don't be no fool

24:55.979 --> 25:00.641
â™ª When love really don't love you

25:01.943 --> 25:04.019
â™ª I said don't love you

25:06.323 --> 25:08.481
I have seen the day that I could tell...

25:08.575 --> 25:11.826
...a whispering tale in a fair lady's ear
such as would please.

25:11.912 --> 25:13.786
â™ª Amore! Amore!

25:13.873 --> 25:14.987
â™ª Amore...

25:17.710 --> 25:18.741
Whoo!

25:58.127 --> 26:05.506
â™ª Pride can stand a thousand trials

26:05.802 --> 26:11.508
â™ª The strong will never fall

26:12.434 --> 26:18.472
â™ª But watching stars without you

26:18.565 --> 26:23.109
â™ª My soul cried

26:27.199 --> 26:32.574
â™ª Heaving heart

26:32.663 --> 26:40.291
â™ª Is full of pain

26:41.756 --> 26:48.174
â™ª Oh, oh

26:48.263 --> 26:55.642
â™ª The aching

26:57.773 --> 27:07.774
â™ª CoÂœ I'm kissing you

27:07.867 --> 27:12.114
â™ª Oh

27:12.205 --> 27:26.334
â™ª I'm kissing you

27:26.428 --> 27:28.504
Madam, your mother calls!

27:28.597 --> 27:31.931
â™ª Touch me deep

27:33.060 --> 27:40.226
â™ª Pure and true

27:42.403 --> 27:44.859
Will you now deny to dance?

27:44.947 --> 27:47.652
A man, young lady. Such a man!

27:58.920 --> 28:00.165
What!

28:00.255 --> 28:04.004
Dares that slave come hither
to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

28:04.092 --> 28:09.170
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
to strike him dead I hold it not a sin!

28:09.807 --> 28:12.642
Why, how now, kinsman!
Wherefore storm you so?

28:12.726 --> 28:15.763
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo.
A Montague, our foe.

28:15.855 --> 28:17.931
- Romeo is it?
- 'Tis he.

28:18.024 --> 28:21.144
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.

28:21.235 --> 28:23.691
I would not for the wealth of all this town...

28:23.780 --> 28:26.187
...here in my house do him disparagement.

28:26.282 --> 28:28.820
Therefore be patient, take no note of him.

28:28.910 --> 28:30.285
Uncle, I'll not endure him.

28:31.496 --> 28:33.572
He shall be endured.

28:34.541 --> 28:35.739
Go to!

28:35.834 --> 28:38.159
What, goodman boy? I say he shall!

28:38.253 --> 28:39.451
Go to!

28:39.546 --> 28:41.206
Uncle, 'tis a shame.

28:41.298 --> 28:43.207
Make a mutiny among my guests?

29:02.362 --> 29:04.189
Did my heart love till now?

29:05.240 --> 29:07.316
Forswear it, sight.

29:07.409 --> 29:10.493
For I never saw true beauty till this night.

29:11.580 --> 29:21.996
â™ª Where are you now?

29:22.883 --> 29:34.177
â™ª Where are you now?

29:37.273 --> 29:50.573
â™ª CoÂœ I'm kissing you

29:51.872 --> 30:08.386
â™ª I'm kissing you now

30:32.289 --> 30:35.575
If I profane with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine...

30:35.668 --> 30:37.744
...the gentle sin is this.

30:43.593 --> 30:47.293
My lips, two blushing pilgrims,
ready stand...

30:47.388 --> 30:51.303
...to smooth that rough touch
with a tender kiss.

30:51.684 --> 30:54.472
Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much...

30:54.562 --> 30:56.935
...which mannerly devotion shows in this.

30:57.023 --> 31:01.235
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch...

31:01.320 --> 31:04.736
...and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

31:05.240 --> 31:08.823
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

31:09.370 --> 31:12.821
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

31:13.374 --> 31:16.161
Well, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

31:16.252 --> 31:19.621
They pray, grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair.

31:19.714 --> 31:23.759
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

31:24.469 --> 31:27.423
Then move not,
while my prayer's effect I take.

31:27.514 --> 31:29.174
- Yoo-hoo!
- (elevator pings)

31:31.977 --> 31:32.641
Dave!

31:34.646 --> 31:35.844
Oh! Agh!

31:38.233 --> 31:38.731
Ugh!

31:44.114 --> 31:47.318
Thus from my lips,
by thine, my sin is purged.

31:47.409 --> 31:49.449
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took?

31:49.537 --> 31:52.372
Sin from my lips?
O trespass sweetly urged!

31:52.456 --> 31:54.081
Give me my sin again.

31:56.919 --> 31:58.996
You kiss by the book.

32:06.680 --> 32:08.637
Juliet! Juliet! Oh!

32:08.932 --> 32:10.592
Juliet?

32:11.268 --> 32:12.466
Juliet!

32:21.612 --> 32:24.566
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

32:26.450 --> 32:28.110
Come, let's away!

32:55.189 --> 32:57.478
Is she a Capulet?

32:59.235 --> 33:02.401
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague...

33:02.488 --> 33:05.062
...the only son of your great enemy.

33:24.970 --> 33:28.006
Away, be gone. The sport is at its best.

33:28.515 --> 33:31.137
Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest.

34:03.552 --> 34:07.965
I am a pretty piece of flesh!

34:08.224 --> 34:13.051
(chanting) I am a pretty piece of flesh!

34:13.396 --> 34:18.389
I am a pretty piece of flesh! I am!

34:26.993 --> 34:29.745
My only love sprung from my only hate!

34:30.664 --> 34:33.867
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!

34:33.958 --> 34:39.036
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
that I must love a loathed enemy.

34:51.978 --> 34:54.136
I will withdraw.

34:54.230 --> 34:57.813
But this intrusion shall,
now seeming sweet...

34:57.901 --> 35:00.392
...convert to bitterest gall.

35:03.990 --> 35:06.612
(chanting) A pretty piece of flesh! I am!

35:08.537 --> 35:11.158
A pretty piece of...

35:11.248 --> 35:12.279
Romeo!

35:12.374 --> 35:14.248
- Romeo!
- Romeo!

35:14.334 --> 35:15.330
Romeo!

35:15.461 --> 35:17.952
Humours! Madman!

35:18.213 --> 35:20.918
Passion! Lover!

35:21.467 --> 35:24.384
I will conjure thee
by Rosaline's bright eyes...

35:24.470 --> 35:27.554
...by her high forehead
and her scarlet lip...

35:27.640 --> 35:31.852
...by her fine foot, straight leg,
and quivering thigh!

35:35.648 --> 35:40.109
O Romeo, that she were an open-ass
and thou a poperin pear!

35:40.195 --> 35:42.733
He jests at scars that never felt the wound.

35:42.823 --> 35:43.522
Romeo!

35:44.783 --> 35:45.898
(Mercutio) Good night!

35:45.993 --> 35:50.655
I'll to my truckle-bed.
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.

36:12.645 --> 36:14.104
Oh!

36:22.906 --> 36:23.937
(clatter)

36:24.032 --> 36:25.610
(dog barks)

36:29.496 --> 36:31.240
But soft!

36:31.332 --> 36:33.657
What light through yonder window breaks?

36:39.715 --> 36:41.792
It is the east...

36:41.884 --> 36:44.755
...and Juliet is the sun!

36:48.725 --> 36:52.509
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...

36:52.604 --> 36:55.309
...who is already sick and pale with grief...

36:55.398 --> 36:59.348
...that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she.

36:59.444 --> 37:02.648
Be not her maid, since she is envious.

37:02.740 --> 37:07.117
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
and none but fools do wear it.

37:09.455 --> 37:12.456
O cast it off!

37:17.880 --> 37:19.125
(elevator)

37:21.676 --> 37:24.167
It is my lady, it is my love.

37:24.679 --> 37:26.755
O that she knew she were.

37:34.481 --> 37:35.726
Ay me!

37:38.944 --> 37:41.020
She speaks.

37:41.113 --> 37:43.189
Speak again, bright angel.

37:45.075 --> 37:46.534
Romeo.

37:47.870 --> 37:49.578
O Romeo!

37:49.664 --> 37:51.740
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

37:56.421 --> 37:58.710
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

37:58.798 --> 38:03.710
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
and I'll no longer be a Capulet.

38:05.347 --> 38:07.423
Shall I hear more...

38:07.516 --> 38:09.508
...or shall I speak at this?

38:09.601 --> 38:12.092
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.

38:12.563 --> 38:15.398
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.

38:15.482 --> 38:17.522
What's Montague?

38:17.610 --> 38:19.483
It is not hand...

38:19.570 --> 38:22.061
...nor foot, nor arm, nor face...

38:24.283 --> 38:27.403
...nor any other part belonging to a man.

38:27.995 --> 38:30.072
O be some other name!

38:32.458 --> 38:34.535
What's in a name?

38:35.128 --> 38:39.340
That which we call a rose by
any other word would smell as sweet.

38:39.424 --> 38:42.674
So Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called...

38:42.761 --> 38:47.553
...retain that dear perfection
which he owes without that title.

38:48.684 --> 38:50.641
Romeo, doff thy name;

38:50.728 --> 38:54.263
...and for thy name, which is
no part of thee, take all myself.

38:54.356 --> 38:56.432
- I take thee at thy word.
- Agh!

39:07.120 --> 39:09.196
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

39:09.289 --> 39:11.661
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.205
How camest thou hither, tell me,
and wherefore?

39:14.294 --> 39:16.334
The garden walls are high
and hard to climb...

39:16.421 --> 39:18.877
...and the place death,
considering who thou art.

39:18.965 --> 39:21.670
With love's light wings
did I o'erperch these walls...

39:21.760 --> 39:23.836
...for stony limits cannot hold love out...

39:23.929 --> 39:26.385
...and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

39:26.473 --> 39:29.225
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me!

39:51.833 --> 39:54.751
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

39:58.882 --> 40:02.334
I have night's cloak
to hide me from their eyes.

40:02.594 --> 40:04.671
But thou love me...

40:04.763 --> 40:06.840
...let them find me here.

40:07.349 --> 40:12.142
My life were better ended by their hate
than death prorogued...

40:15.274 --> 40:17.351
...wanting of thy love.

40:56.734 --> 40:59.308
Thou knowest
the mask of night is on my face;

40:59.404 --> 41:01.812
...else would a maiden blush
bepaint my cheek...

41:01.907 --> 41:04.576
...for that which thou hast
heard me speak tonight.

41:04.659 --> 41:06.736
Fain would I dwell on form...

41:06.828 --> 41:08.951
...fain, fain deny what I have spoke.

41:09.039 --> 41:11.530
But... farewell compliment.

41:13.252 --> 41:15.328
Dost thou love me?

41:17.006 --> 41:19.579
I know thou wilt say "Ay",
and I will take thy word.

41:19.675 --> 41:22.213
Yet, if thou swear'st,
thou may'st prove false.

41:22.303 --> 41:25.802
O gentle Romeo, if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

41:25.890 --> 41:28.381
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow...

41:28.476 --> 41:31.810
...that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops...

41:31.896 --> 41:33.972
O swear not by the moon...

41:34.065 --> 41:37.933
...the inconstant moon that monthly
changes in her circled orb...

41:38.028 --> 41:40.863
...lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

41:40.947 --> 41:43.699
(chuckles) What shall I swear by?

41:43.784 --> 41:45.860
Do not swear at all.

41:45.953 --> 41:48.029
Or, if thou wilt...

41:48.122 --> 41:52.072
...swear by thy gracious self
which is the god of my idolatry...

41:52.167 --> 41:54.244
...and I'll believe thee.

41:54.712 --> 41:56.788
If my heart's...

41:57.340 --> 41:59.416
...dear love...

42:09.102 --> 42:14.689
Do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy in this contract tonight.

42:14.774 --> 42:18.226
It is too rash, too unadvised,
too sudden, too like the lightning...

42:18.320 --> 42:20.989
...which doth cease to be
ere one can say "It lightens".

42:21.073 --> 42:22.532
Sweet, good night!

42:22.616 --> 42:25.321
This bud of love,
by summer's ripening breath...

42:25.411 --> 42:28.162
...may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

42:28.247 --> 42:29.326
Good night.

42:30.833 --> 42:32.375
Good night!

42:34.795 --> 42:36.835
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

42:38.966 --> 42:41.458
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

42:43.555 --> 42:47.173
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

42:50.770 --> 42:53.772
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!

43:03.993 --> 43:05.535
Juliet!

43:13.503 --> 43:15.910
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.

43:16.005 --> 43:19.090
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
thy purpose marriage...

43:19.175 --> 43:22.093
...send me word tomorrow, by one
that I'll procure to come to thee...

43:22.178 --> 43:24.467
...where and what time thou wilt
perform the rite...

43:24.556 --> 43:26.513
...and all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay...

43:26.600 --> 43:28.842
...and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

43:28.935 --> 43:30.098
Julieta!

43:30.729 --> 43:32.852
Ay! By and by, I come!

43:32.940 --> 43:35.941
But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee...

43:36.026 --> 43:38.102
- Juliet!
- By and by, I come!

43:38.195 --> 43:40.982
...to cease thy strife,
and leave me to my grief.

43:42.491 --> 43:44.283
Tomorrow will I send.

43:44.368 --> 43:46.278
So thrive my soul.

43:54.003 --> 43:55.961
A thousand times good night.

43:56.047 --> 43:59.214
A thousand times the worse,
to want thy light!

44:00.468 --> 44:01.667
Juliet!

44:03.638 --> 44:05.298
Julieta!

44:09.603 --> 44:11.394
Good night.

44:13.816 --> 44:17.814
Love goes toward love
as schoolboys from their books;

44:19.196 --> 44:21.273
...but love from love...

44:22.617 --> 44:24.942
...toward school with heavy looks.

44:25.536 --> 44:27.410
- (window opens)
- Romeo!

44:28.248 --> 44:30.205
What o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

44:31.292 --> 44:33.368
By the hour of nine.

44:33.461 --> 44:36.665
I will not fail. 'Tis twenty year till then.

44:37.132 --> 44:38.923
Good night.

44:46.683 --> 44:48.475
Good night. Good night.

44:57.987 --> 45:00.063
Parting is such sweet sorrow...

45:00.156 --> 45:03.406
...that I shall say good night till it be morrow.

45:05.119 --> 45:08.904
Juliet!

45:09.165 --> 45:12.997
â™ª You and me always

45:13.086 --> 45:15.577
â™ª And for ever

45:15.672 --> 45:19.255
â™ª You and me always

45:19.343 --> 45:22.260
â™ª And for ever

45:22.346 --> 45:27.388
â™ª Ba ba-ba ba-ba

45:27.476 --> 45:30.976
â™ª It was always you and me...

45:31.814 --> 45:36.809
Almighty is the powerful grace
that lies in plants, herbs, stones...

45:36.903 --> 45:38.979
...and their true qualities.

45:42.242 --> 45:44.911
For nought so vile
that on the earth doth live...

45:44.995 --> 45:47.664
...but to the earth
some special good doth give.

45:50.125 --> 45:53.708
And nought so good
but strained from that fair use...

45:53.795 --> 45:56.547
...revolts from true birth,
stumbling on abuse.

45:57.508 --> 46:00.924
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied...

46:01.011 --> 46:04.380
...and vice sometime's by action dignified.

46:04.473 --> 46:08.886
Within the infant rind of this... weak flower...

46:08.978 --> 46:11.730
...poison is resident...

46:11.814 --> 46:14.140
...and medicine power.

46:14.233 --> 46:18.278
For this, being smelt,
with that part cheers each part.

46:18.363 --> 46:19.987
Being tasted...

46:20.073 --> 46:24.402
...slays all senses with the heart.

46:25.704 --> 46:29.951
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
in man as well as herbs...

46:30.042 --> 46:32.118
...grace and rude will.

46:32.211 --> 46:36.672
And where the worser is predominant,
full soon the canker death...

46:36.757 --> 46:38.666
...eats up that plant.

46:38.759 --> 46:40.835
Good morrow, Father!

46:40.928 --> 46:42.837
Benedicite!

46:44.098 --> 46:47.135
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?

46:47.894 --> 46:49.602
(boys) Good morrow, Romeo.

46:49.687 --> 46:51.644
Good morrow.

46:51.731 --> 46:54.305
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head...

46:54.400 --> 46:57.022
...so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.

46:57.904 --> 47:00.739
Or if not so, then here I hit it right...

47:01.408 --> 47:04.325
Our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight!

47:05.245 --> 47:08.246
The last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.

47:08.332 --> 47:10.704
God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?

47:10.793 --> 47:12.999
Rosaline? My ghostly father, no!

47:13.087 --> 47:15.578
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

47:15.673 --> 47:18.508
That's my good son.
But where then hast thou been?

47:18.592 --> 47:22.341
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
where on a sudden one hath wounded me...

47:22.430 --> 47:24.054
...that's by me wounded.

47:24.140 --> 47:27.141
Both our remedies within thy help
and holy physic lies.

47:27.227 --> 47:29.765
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.

47:29.854 --> 47:32.606
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

47:32.691 --> 47:35.645
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set...

47:35.735 --> 47:38.487
...on the fair daughter of rich Capulet.

47:39.072 --> 47:41.148
We met, we wooed...

47:41.825 --> 47:43.901
...we made exchange of vow.

47:44.953 --> 47:48.239
I'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray...

47:48.332 --> 47:51.084
...that thou consent to marry us today.

47:53.546 --> 47:55.752
Holy Saint Francis!

47:55.840 --> 47:57.916
What a change is here!

47:58.009 --> 48:02.303
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love
so dear, so soon forsaken?

48:02.388 --> 48:06.967
Young men's love then lies not truly
in their hearts, but in their eyes.

48:07.519 --> 48:09.974
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

48:10.063 --> 48:12.981
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

48:16.320 --> 48:17.980
I pray thee...

48:18.989 --> 48:20.531
...chide me not!

48:20.616 --> 48:24.566
Her I love now doth grace for grace
and love for love allow.

48:24.662 --> 48:26.738
The other did not so.

48:26.831 --> 48:28.907
Yes, she well knew...

48:29.000 --> 48:32.618
...thy love did read by rote,
that could not spell.

48:36.174 --> 48:42.462
â™ª Maybe I'm just like my mother

48:42.555 --> 48:47.383
â™ª She's never satisfied

48:47.477 --> 48:51.807
For this alliance may so happy prove...

48:51.898 --> 48:55.433
...to turn your households'rancour...

48:55.527 --> 48:57.354
...to pure love.

48:57.446 --> 49:00.151
â™ª This is what it sounds like

49:00.241 --> 49:04.618
â™ª When doves cry

49:06.247 --> 49:09.283
Come, young waverer, come, go with me.

49:09.542 --> 49:12.294
In one respect I'll thy assistant be.

49:13.922 --> 49:16.709
For this alliance may so happy prove...

49:16.800 --> 49:19.670
...to turn your households' rancour
to pure love.

49:19.761 --> 49:21.801
O let us hence! I stand on sudden haste!

49:25.100 --> 49:28.386
Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.

49:29.521 --> 49:32.937
â™ª Maybe I'm just too demanding

49:33.025 --> 49:36.892
â™ª Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

49:36.987 --> 49:40.606
â™ª Maybe I'm just like my mother

49:40.700 --> 49:44.828
â™ª She's never satisfied

49:44.912 --> 49:46.870
â™ª Why do we scream at each other?

50:00.053 --> 50:02.129
â™ª This is what it sounds like

50:03.932 --> 50:06.008
â™ª This is what it sounds like

50:07.311 --> 50:09.469
â™ª This is what it sounds like

50:09.563 --> 50:13.228
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home tonight?

50:13.317 --> 50:16.318
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

50:16.404 --> 50:20.236
Why, that same pale hard-hearted
wench, that Rosaline...

50:20.324 --> 50:22.946
...torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

50:23.036 --> 50:25.871
Tybalt hath sent a letter to his father's house.

50:25.955 --> 50:28.826
- A challenge, on my life!
- Romeo will answer it?

50:28.917 --> 50:31.123
Any man that can write may answer a letter.

50:31.211 --> 50:34.627
Nay, he will answer the letter's master,
how he dares being dared.

50:34.714 --> 50:40.136
Well, alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead!
Stabbed with a white wench's black eye!

50:40.220 --> 50:42.260
Run through the ear with a love-song!

50:42.347 --> 50:45.633
The very pin of his heart cleft
with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft!

50:45.726 --> 50:48.051
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

50:48.145 --> 50:51.514
- Why, what is Tybalt?
- More than Prince of Cats.

50:52.108 --> 50:55.691
He is the courageous captain of compliments!

50:56.571 --> 50:59.358
He fights as you sing pricksong.

51:00.408 --> 51:03.326
Keeps time, distance, and proportion.

51:03.870 --> 51:06.076
He rests his minim rests.

51:06.164 --> 51:09.533
One, two, and a third...

51:09.626 --> 51:10.622
...in your bosom.

51:10.710 --> 51:13.202
The very butcher of a silk button.

51:13.672 --> 51:15.214
A duellist.

51:15.299 --> 51:18.798
A duellist! A gentleman
of the very first house...

51:18.886 --> 51:20.962
...of the first and second cause.

51:21.055 --> 51:23.131
The immortal passado!

51:24.683 --> 51:26.760
The punto reverso!

51:27.269 --> 51:28.550
The, um... hai!

51:28.646 --> 51:31.351
- The what?
- (laughs)

51:31.440 --> 51:33.517
Here comes Romeo.

51:34.485 --> 51:35.730
Romeo!

51:38.698 --> 51:40.774
Ho-ho, taffeta punk!

51:40.867 --> 51:42.943
Signor Romeo, bonjour!

51:43.745 --> 51:46.782
There's a French salutation
to your French slop.

51:46.873 --> 51:49.329
You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.

51:49.418 --> 51:52.335
Good morrow to you both.
What counterfeit did I give you?

51:52.421 --> 51:54.876
The slip, sir, the slip.
Can you not conceive?

51:54.965 --> 51:57.456
Pardon, good Mercutio.
My business was great...

51:57.551 --> 52:00.042
...and in such a case as mine
a man may strain courtesy.

52:00.137 --> 52:01.382
That's as much as to say...

52:01.472 --> 52:05.340
...such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams!

52:05.434 --> 52:08.768
- Meaning to curtsy?
- Thou hast most kindly hit it.

52:08.855 --> 52:12.438
- A most courteous exposition.
- Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

52:12.525 --> 52:14.648
- Pink for flower?
- Right.

52:14.736 --> 52:17.227
Why, then is my pump well flowered!

52:17.322 --> 52:18.982
O sure wit!

52:19.074 --> 52:22.407
Now art thou sociable. Now art thou Romeo!

52:22.494 --> 52:25.945
Now art thou what thou art,
by art as well as by nature!

52:27.249 --> 52:29.325
Here's goodly gear!

52:30.794 --> 52:33.001
God ye good e'en, fair gentlewoman.

52:33.088 --> 52:35.579
I desire some confidence with you.

52:38.844 --> 52:39.876
Ooh! A bawd!

52:40.429 --> 52:42.718
(Mercutio) A bawd, a bawd, a bawd!

52:42.807 --> 52:45.132
(all chanting) So ho! So ho!

52:45.226 --> 52:46.934
So ho! So ho!

52:47.228 --> 52:49.185
Romeo!

52:49.272 --> 52:51.146
Romeo!

52:52.067 --> 52:53.312
Romeo!

52:56.279 --> 52:58.355
Will you come to your father's?

52:59.241 --> 53:01.317
We'll to dinner thither.

53:01.410 --> 53:03.201
I will follow you.

53:05.497 --> 53:08.285
(Mercutio) Farewell, ancient lady! Farewell!

53:10.377 --> 53:14.078
If ye should lead her
in a fool's paradise, as they say...

53:14.173 --> 53:17.838
...it were a very gross kind
of behaviour, as they say.

53:17.927 --> 53:20.003
For the lady is young...

53:20.096 --> 53:23.880
...and, therefore, if you should
deal double with her...

53:23.975 --> 53:28.518
...truly it were an ill thing,
and very weak dealing.

53:29.648 --> 53:32.602
Bid her to come to confession
this afternoon...

53:32.692 --> 53:37.651
...and there she shall,
at Friar Laurence's cell, be shrived...

53:38.574 --> 53:40.400
...and married.

53:42.327 --> 53:44.285
â™ª Love me, love me

53:44.371 --> 53:46.447
â™ª Say that you love me

53:46.540 --> 53:48.866
â™ª Fool me, fool me

53:49.126 --> 53:50.502
â™ª Go on and fool me

53:50.586 --> 53:52.579
â™ª Love me, love me

53:52.672 --> 53:54.830
â™ª Pretend that you love me

53:54.924 --> 53:57.000
O honey nurse! What news?

53:57.760 --> 54:01.046
- Nurse!
- I am aweary! Give me leave awhile!

54:01.431 --> 54:03.507
Fie, how my bones ache!

54:04.100 --> 54:06.176
What ajaunce have I!

54:06.561 --> 54:08.803
Would thou hadst my bones
and I thy news.

54:08.897 --> 54:10.890
Come, I pray thee, speak!

54:10.982 --> 54:14.850
Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?

54:14.945 --> 54:17.483
Can you not see that I am out of breath?

54:17.573 --> 54:19.980
How art thou out of breath
when thou hast breath...

54:20.075 --> 54:22.033
...to say to me that thou art out of breath?

54:22.953 --> 54:25.789
Is the news good or bad? Answer to that.

54:25.873 --> 54:29.538
Well, you have made a simple choice.

54:29.627 --> 54:32.201
You know not how to choose a man.

54:32.296 --> 54:35.463
Romeo? No, not he.

54:35.550 --> 54:38.800
Though his face be better than any man's...

54:38.887 --> 54:41.460
...yet his leg excels all men's...

54:41.556 --> 54:44.178
...and for a hand and a foot and a body...

54:44.267 --> 54:45.596
(giggles)

54:48.146 --> 54:51.516
But all this I did know before.
What says he of our marriage?

54:51.608 --> 54:52.640
What of that?

54:52.735 --> 54:55.938
Lord, how my head aches!
What a head have I!

54:56.405 --> 54:59.110
- And my back!
- Ohh...

54:59.909 --> 55:01.948
T'other side!

55:02.370 --> 55:04.030
Oh, my back!

55:04.121 --> 55:07.123
In faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.

55:07.208 --> 55:09.699
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse!

55:09.794 --> 55:12.083
Tell me, what says my love?

55:12.172 --> 55:14.793
Thy love says, like an honest gentleman...

55:14.883 --> 55:17.718
...and a courteous, and a kind,
and a handsome...

55:17.802 --> 55:19.795
...and, I warrant, a virtuous...

55:19.888 --> 55:22.296
- Where is your mother?
- "Where is your mother?"

55:22.391 --> 55:24.383
How oddly thou repliest!

55:24.476 --> 55:27.430
Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
"Where is your mother?"

55:27.521 --> 55:31.435
God's Lady dear! Are you so hot?
Henceforth, do your messages yourself!

55:31.525 --> 55:34.977
O here's such a coil!
Come, what says Romeo?

55:40.493 --> 55:43.364
Have you got leave
to go to confession today?

55:45.566 --> 55:46.681
I have.

55:47.943 --> 55:51.443
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell.

55:51.989 --> 55:55.405
There stays a husband to make you a wife!

55:55.493 --> 55:57.367
Oh!

55:58.246 --> 56:06.455
â™ª Everybody's free to feel good

56:07.672 --> 56:11.836
â™ª To feel good

56:14.012 --> 56:16.254
â™ª Brother and sister

56:16.348 --> 56:20.642
â™ª Together we'll make it through

56:21.896 --> 56:24.184
â™ª Oh-oh, yeah

56:24.940 --> 56:31.738
â™ª Someday a spirit will take you
and guide you there

56:34.826 --> 56:37.780
â™ª I know you've been hurting

56:37.871 --> 56:43.031
â™ª But I've been waiting to be there for you

56:45.212 --> 56:49.755
â™ª And I'll be there just helping you out

56:49.841 --> 56:55.180
â™ª Whenever I can

56:55.264 --> 56:57.387
(choir) â™ª Everybody's free

56:57.474 --> 57:00.641
â™ª Everybody's free

57:00.728 --> 57:04.144
â™ª Oh, yeah

57:04.857 --> 57:07.229
These violent delights...

57:07.318 --> 57:09.607
...have violent ends.

57:09.696 --> 57:13.195
And in their triumph die
like fire and powder...

57:13.283 --> 57:15.952
...which, as they kiss, consume.

57:16.036 --> 57:20.614
The sweetest honey is loathsome
in his own deliciousness.

57:20.707 --> 57:24.408
Therefore love moderately.

57:24.503 --> 57:27.954
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter,
for us both.

57:29.133 --> 57:32.003
â™ª Oh, to feel good

57:32.261 --> 57:34.004
(thunder)

57:36.223 --> 57:38.097
(gunshot)

57:40.394 --> 57:43.561
(Benvolio) I pray thee,
good Mercutio, let's retire!

57:43.648 --> 57:46.649
The day is hot, the Capels are abroad...

57:50.238 --> 57:53.275
...and if we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl...

57:53.366 --> 57:57.150
...for now, these hot days,
is the mad blood stirring.

57:57.496 --> 57:59.868
We're the Caps! (laughs)

57:59.957 --> 58:01.617
Wha... Wha... Wha...

58:03.335 --> 58:06.005
See? Thou art like one of these fellows...

58:06.088 --> 58:09.208
...that, when he enters
the confines of a tavern...

58:09.300 --> 58:12.051
...claps me his Sword upon the table...

58:12.136 --> 58:14.378
...and says, "God send me no need of thee".

58:14.472 --> 58:17.556
And, by the operation of the second cup...

58:17.642 --> 58:21.556
...draws him on the drawer,
when indeed there is no need.

58:21.646 --> 58:23.603
- Yeah!
- (laughter)

58:24.315 --> 58:26.059
Am I like such a fellow?

58:26.151 --> 58:30.018
Thou art as hot ajack in thy mood
as any in Verona.

58:33.700 --> 58:35.776
By my head, here come the Capulets.

58:37.287 --> 58:40.039
By my heel... I care not.

58:42.042 --> 58:44.118
Follow me close.

58:58.393 --> 59:01.762
Gentlemen, good day.
A word with one of you?

59:03.064 --> 59:04.891
Ooh!

59:04.983 --> 59:07.059
And but one word with one of us?

59:07.152 --> 59:09.228
Couple it with something.

59:10.280 --> 59:11.940
Make it a word and a...

59:12.032 --> 59:12.897
...a blow!

59:12.991 --> 59:14.071
(laughter)

59:17.246 --> 59:19.369
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir...

59:19.456 --> 59:21.579
...and you will give me occasion.

59:21.667 --> 59:24.419
Could you not take some occasion
without giving?

59:24.503 --> 59:25.832
(laughter)

59:25.922 --> 59:27.167
Mercutio!

59:27.256 --> 59:30.210
Thou, uh... consortest with Romeo?

59:33.054 --> 59:34.632
Consort!

59:36.474 --> 59:38.597
What, dost thou make us minstrels?

59:38.685 --> 59:41.769
And thou make minstrels of us,
look to hear nothing but discords!

59:42.147 --> 59:43.807
Here's my fiddlestick!

59:43.899 --> 59:46.935
Here's that shall make you dance!
Zounds! Consort!

59:47.027 --> 59:50.776
Either withdraw unto some private place,
or reason coldly of your grievances...

59:50.864 --> 59:53.106
...or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us!

59:53.200 --> 59:55.193
Men's eyes were made to look,
and let them gaze.

59:55.286 --> 59:58.037
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

01:00:01.542 --> 01:00:04.496
Peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.

01:00:06.172 --> 01:00:07.631
Mercutio!

01:00:10.218 --> 01:00:11.463
Romeo!

01:00:19.311 --> 01:00:22.596
The love I bear thee can afford
no better term than this.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.184
Thou art a villain!

01:00:27.444 --> 01:00:28.939
(snaps fingers)

01:01:09.196 --> 01:01:11.272
Tybalt...

01:01:12.909 --> 01:01:15.826
...the reason that I have to love thee...

01:01:16.287 --> 01:01:18.363
...doth much excuse...

01:01:18.456 --> 01:01:21.540
...the appertaining rage to such a greeting.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.209
Villain am I none.

01:01:29.468 --> 01:01:32.504
Therefore, farewell.

01:01:32.596 --> 01:01:34.553
I see thou knowest me not.

01:01:43.524 --> 01:01:46.774
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
that thou hast done me!

01:01:47.486 --> 01:01:49.479
Turn and draw!

01:01:50.448 --> 01:01:51.479
Turn and draw!

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:54.071
Turn and draw.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.825
- Turn and draw!
- I do protest I never injured thee...

01:01:59.124 --> 01:02:01.994
...but love thee better than thou canst devise...

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:05.668
...till thou shalt know the reason of my love.

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:08.081
And so, good Capulet...

01:02:08.175 --> 01:02:11.211
...whose name I tender
as dearly as mine own...

01:02:11.303 --> 01:02:13.379
(thunder)

01:02:15.641 --> 01:02:17.515
...be satisfied.

01:02:20.312 --> 01:02:22.389
Be satisfied.

01:02:23.441 --> 01:02:27.688
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!

01:02:38.248 --> 01:02:40.324
Thou art my soul's hate!

01:02:49.176 --> 01:02:49.876
Tybalt!

01:02:50.761 --> 01:02:52.339
You rat-catcher!

01:02:52.429 --> 01:02:53.972
Will you walk?

01:02:54.723 --> 01:02:56.597
What wouldst thou have with me?

01:02:56.684 --> 01:02:59.555
Good King of Cats,
nothing but one of your nine lives!

01:02:59.645 --> 01:03:00.974
I am for you!

01:03:09.239 --> 01:03:10.401
(groans)

01:03:15.453 --> 01:03:18.657
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio!

01:03:24.922 --> 01:03:26.250
(yells)

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.789
(slash)

01:03:41.981 --> 01:03:43.357
(Mercutio chuckles)

01:03:43.441 --> 01:03:47.190
- Art thou hurt?
- Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch.

01:03:49.823 --> 01:03:51.780
A scratch!

01:03:53.076 --> 01:03:53.942
Ay, a scratch...

01:03:54.911 --> 01:03:56.406
A scratch! (laughs)

01:04:00.584 --> 01:04:03.704
Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.

01:04:03.796 --> 01:04:05.587
'Twill serve.

01:04:05.673 --> 01:04:09.505
Ask for me tomorrow
and you shall find me a grave man.

01:04:26.361 --> 01:04:30.062
A plague... o' both your houses!

01:04:35.788 --> 01:04:38.409
They have made worms' meat of me.

01:04:38.499 --> 01:04:42.413
A plague on both your houses!

01:04:42.503 --> 01:04:43.997
(echoing) Your houses! Your houses!

01:04:44.088 --> 01:04:46.330
Your houses! Your houses!

01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:00.352
No!

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:26.337
(Mercutio)
Why the devil came you between us?

01:05:26.424 --> 01:05:28.832
I was hurt under your arm.

01:05:28.926 --> 01:05:31.050
I thought all for the best!

01:05:32.514 --> 01:05:36.428
A plague o' both your houses.

01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:42.139
(sobs) No! No!

01:05:44.985 --> 01:05:47.108
(Abra) Come forth!

01:05:49.281 --> 01:05:50.906
Come forth!

01:05:50.991 --> 01:05:53.067
Mercutio!

01:05:56.706 --> 01:06:01.949
â™ª Requiem aeternam

01:06:03.046 --> 01:06:08.420
â™ª Requiem aeternam

01:06:10.178 --> 01:06:22.434
â™ª Dona eis

01:06:26.654 --> 01:06:28.527
No!

01:07:07.613 --> 01:07:09.902
Come, gentle night.

01:07:10.533 --> 01:07:14.447
Come, loving, black-browed night.
Give me my Romeo.

01:07:14.704 --> 01:07:19.449
And when I shall die, take him
and cut him out in little stars...

01:07:19.542 --> 01:07:22.994
...and he will make
the face of heaven so fine...

01:07:23.088 --> 01:07:26.753
...that all the world
will be in love with night...

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:29.677
...and pay no worship to the garish sun.

01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:33.922
O! I have bought the mansion of a love...

01:07:34.016 --> 01:07:36.305
...but not possessed it;

01:07:36.393 --> 01:07:39.145
...and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed.

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:43.354
So... tedious is this day...

01:07:43.442 --> 01:07:47.025
...as is the night before some festival
to an impatient child...

01:07:47.113 --> 01:07:50.197
...that hath new robes and may not wear them.

01:07:51.659 --> 01:07:53.569
(yelling)

01:08:38.375 --> 01:08:41.874
Mercutio's soul is but a little way
above our heads...

01:08:41.962 --> 01:08:44.037
...staying for thine to keep him company!

01:08:44.131 --> 01:08:47.131
Thou wretched boy shalt with him hence!

01:08:47.926 --> 01:08:50.002
(sobbing) Either thou, or l...

01:08:50.095 --> 01:08:52.502
...or both, must go with him!

01:08:53.224 --> 01:08:56.723
Either thou, or l, or both, must go with him!

01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:58.305
Either thou...

01:08:58.395 --> 01:09:02.475
...or l, or both, must go with him!

01:09:06.988 --> 01:09:09.064
(yells)

01:09:21.627 --> 01:09:23.705
(thunder)

01:10:00.961 --> 01:10:05.540
I am fortune's fool!

01:10:14.976 --> 01:10:16.091
Romeo!

01:10:18.021 --> 01:10:20.393
Away, be gone! Stand not amazed!

01:10:26.863 --> 01:10:28.488
Away!

01:10:28.573 --> 01:10:30.650
Romeo!

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:39.410
(sirens)

01:10:44.131 --> 01:10:46.208
Tybalt! (sobs)

01:10:51.389 --> 01:10:54.509
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

01:10:57.729 --> 01:11:00.564
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

01:11:02.859 --> 01:11:06.359
Romeo he cries aloud, "Hold, friends!"

01:11:07.656 --> 01:11:10.491
Tybalt hit the life of stout Mercutio.

01:11:10.993 --> 01:11:13.069
Tybalt here slain...

01:11:13.996 --> 01:11:16.072
...Romeo's hand did slay.

01:11:16.165 --> 01:11:16.947
Prince!

01:11:18.376 --> 01:11:20.036
As thou art true...

01:11:20.127 --> 01:11:22.963
...for blood of ours, shed blood of Montague!

01:11:23.047 --> 01:11:25.799
Romeo... spoke him fair...

01:11:25.883 --> 01:11:28.553
...could not take truce
with the unruly spleen of Tybalt...

01:11:28.636 --> 01:11:30.012
...deaf to peace.

01:11:30.096 --> 01:11:32.718
He is a kinsman to the Montague.
Affection makes him false!

01:11:33.850 --> 01:11:36.851
I beg forjustice,
which thou, Prince, must give!

01:11:37.896 --> 01:11:39.723
Romeo slew Tybalt.

01:11:39.815 --> 01:11:41.475
Romeo must not live!

01:11:43.819 --> 01:11:46.524
Romeo slew him. He slew Mercutio.

01:11:46.614 --> 01:11:49.484
Who now the price of his dear blood
doth owe?

01:11:49.575 --> 01:11:51.651
(wailing)

01:11:53.329 --> 01:11:56.164
Not Romeo, Prince.
He was Mercutio's friend.

01:11:56.249 --> 01:11:59.415
His fault concludes but what the law
should end-the life of Tybalt.

01:11:59.502 --> 01:12:02.040
And for that offence
immediately we do exile him.

01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:03.161
Noble Prince...

01:12:03.256 --> 01:12:05.498
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses!

01:12:05.592 --> 01:12:08.379
Nor tears nor prayers
shall purchase out abuses!

01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:10.094
Therefore use none!

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:16.685
Let Romeo hence in haste!

01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:22.891
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last!

01:12:22.985 --> 01:12:26.152
Romeo is banished!

01:12:27.448 --> 01:12:29.524
Banishment...

01:12:31.202 --> 01:12:33.278
Be merciful, say death.

01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:37.910
For exile hath more terror in his look,
much more than death.

01:12:38.585 --> 01:12:40.873
Do not say banishment.

01:12:41.379 --> 01:12:46.754
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts,
and thou art wedded to calamity.

01:12:46.843 --> 01:12:49.251
Hence from Verona art thou banished.

01:12:49.346 --> 01:12:52.797
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

01:12:52.891 --> 01:12:55.133
There is no world without Verona walls.

01:12:55.227 --> 01:12:59.640
Hence banished is banish'd from
the world, and world's exile is death.

01:12:59.732 --> 01:13:01.475
Then banished is death mistermed.

01:13:01.567 --> 01:13:04.687
Calling death banished, thou cutt'st
my head off with a golden axe...

01:13:04.779 --> 01:13:06.855
...and smil'st upon the stroke
that murders me.

01:13:06.948 --> 01:13:10.032
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!

01:13:10.118 --> 01:13:12.988
This is dear mercy and thou seest it not.

01:13:13.079 --> 01:13:14.110
(knocking)

01:13:15.123 --> 01:13:16.582
Hence!

01:13:19.169 --> 01:13:21.043
(knocking)

01:13:21.922 --> 01:13:22.953
(knocking)

01:13:24.049 --> 01:13:26.622
- I come from my lady Juliet!
- Welcome, then.

01:13:26.718 --> 01:13:28.261
Where is my lady's lord?

01:13:28.345 --> 01:13:30.421
Romeo, come forth.

01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:33.466
- Ah, sir.
- Nurse.

01:13:34.059 --> 01:13:35.933
Ah, sir.

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:38.096
Death's the end of all.

01:13:39.273 --> 01:13:41.349
Speakest thou of Juliet?

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:43.940
Where is she and how doth she?

01:13:44.028 --> 01:13:47.195
And what says my concealed lady
to our cancelled love?

01:13:47.281 --> 01:13:50.698
O she says nothing, sir,
but weeps and weeps.

01:13:50.785 --> 01:13:54.534
And then on Romeo cries,
and then falls down again.

01:13:57.167 --> 01:14:00.832
As if that name, shot from
the deadly level of a gun...

01:14:00.921 --> 01:14:06.342
...did murder her, as that name's
cursed hand murdered her kinsman!

01:14:06.802 --> 01:14:09.293
I thought thy disposition better tempered.

01:14:09.388 --> 01:14:12.306
Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy.

01:14:13.017 --> 01:14:16.018
Tybalt would kill thee,
but thou slewest Tybalt.

01:14:16.103 --> 01:14:18.179
There art thou happy.

01:14:18.731 --> 01:14:23.642
The law that threatened death
becomes thy friend and turns it to exile.

01:14:23.736 --> 01:14:25.776
There art thou happy.

01:14:25.864 --> 01:14:28.568
A pack of blessings light upon thy back.

01:14:28.658 --> 01:14:32.323
Wherefore railest thou on thy birth,
the heaven, and earth...

01:14:32.412 --> 01:14:36.576
...since birth, and heaven, and earth,
all three do meet in thee at once?

01:14:36.667 --> 01:14:38.659
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.

01:14:40.796 --> 01:14:43.204
How well my comfort is revived by this.

01:14:43.674 --> 01:14:44.705
Go.

01:14:45.759 --> 01:14:48.167
Get thee to thy love, as was decreed.

01:14:48.262 --> 01:14:51.465
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.

01:14:52.391 --> 01:14:54.265
Hie you! Make haste!

01:14:55.269 --> 01:14:57.807
But look thou...
stay not till the watch be set...

01:14:57.897 --> 01:15:00.104
...for then thou canst not pass to Mantua...

01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:04.059
...where thou wilt live till we can
find a time to blaze your marriage...

01:15:04.154 --> 01:15:07.071
...reconcile your friends,
beg pardon of the Prince...

01:15:07.157 --> 01:15:10.941
...and call thee back with
twenty hundred thousand times more joy...

01:15:11.036 --> 01:15:13.527
...than thou went'st forth in lamentation.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.955
Quick, hence! Be gone by break of day!

01:15:20.421 --> 01:15:22.129
Sojourn in Mantua!

01:15:22.548 --> 01:15:24.090
Farewell.

01:15:24.175 --> 01:15:26.084
(thunder)

01:15:31.557 --> 01:15:33.182
O God!

01:15:33.267 --> 01:15:36.103
Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

01:15:36.729 --> 01:15:40.727
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!

01:15:42.235 --> 01:15:46.613
Was ever book containing
such vile matter so fairly bound?

01:15:47.115 --> 01:15:51.113
O that deceit should dwell
in such a gorgeous palace!

01:15:55.499 --> 01:15:57.705
She'll not come down tonight.

01:15:59.545 --> 01:16:02.380
These times of woe afford no time to woo.

01:16:02.465 --> 01:16:06.048
Look you, she loved
her kinsman Tybalt dearly.

01:16:06.135 --> 01:16:08.211
And so did I.

01:16:08.304 --> 01:16:09.964
Well...

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:13.175
...we were born to die.

01:16:13.601 --> 01:16:18.596
I'll know her mind early tomorrow.
Tonight she's mewed up to her heaviness.

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:31.368
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?

01:16:31.453 --> 01:16:35.072
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue
shall smooth thy name...

01:16:35.166 --> 01:16:38.950
...when l, thy three-hours' wife,
have mangled it?

01:16:39.045 --> 01:16:42.663
But whyfore, villain,
didst thou kill my cousin?

01:16:43.925 --> 01:16:44.755
(gasps)

01:17:05.781 --> 01:17:15.284
â™ª I'm kissing you

01:17:47.908 --> 01:18:01.457
â™ª CoÂœ I'm kissing you, o-oh

01:18:03.174 --> 01:18:16.604
â™ª I'm kissing you

01:18:22.987 --> 01:18:26.071
I will make a desperate tender
of my child's love.

01:18:26.157 --> 01:18:29.407
I think she will be ruled in all respects by me.

01:18:29.494 --> 01:18:33.278
Nay, more! I doubt it not!

01:18:33.373 --> 01:18:35.531
But what say you to Thursday?

01:18:35.625 --> 01:18:37.701
My lord, I...

01:18:38.378 --> 01:18:40.916
I would that Thursday were tomorrow!

01:18:41.006 --> 01:18:43.757
Thursday let it be, then! Wife!

01:18:43.842 --> 01:18:45.918
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.

01:18:46.011 --> 01:18:49.795
Tell her o' Thursday she shall
be married to this noble sir!

01:20:04.176 --> 01:20:07.094
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.

01:20:08.055 --> 01:20:10.890
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

01:20:11.434 --> 01:20:14.269
Yon light is not daylight; I know it, I.

01:20:14.353 --> 01:20:19.596
It is some meteor that the sun exhales
to light thee on thy way to Mantua.

01:20:19.692 --> 01:20:23.061
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not be gone.

01:20:23.446 --> 01:20:25.522
Well, let me be taken.

01:20:25.615 --> 01:20:27.407
Let me be put to death!

01:20:27.784 --> 01:20:30.275
I have more care to stay than will to go.

01:20:30.370 --> 01:20:33.537
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.

01:20:35.876 --> 01:20:39.292
How is't, my soul? Let's talk. It is not day.

01:20:42.549 --> 01:20:44.838
It is... It is!

01:20:45.469 --> 01:20:47.960
Hie hence, be gone, away!

01:20:48.556 --> 01:20:50.714
O now be gone!
More light and light it grows.

01:20:51.601 --> 01:20:53.677
More light and light...

01:20:53.770 --> 01:20:55.976
...more dark and dark our woes.

01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.899
- (door opens)
- Madam!

01:21:02.445 --> 01:21:04.771
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber!

01:21:04.865 --> 01:21:07.237
(Gloria) Ho, daughter, are you up?

01:21:13.332 --> 01:21:14.743
Then, window...

01:21:14.833 --> 01:21:16.909
...let day in and let life...

01:21:17.711 --> 01:21:18.743
...out!

01:21:18.837 --> 01:21:20.000
Juliet?

01:21:20.089 --> 01:21:23.375
- Think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
- I doubt it not.

01:21:26.804 --> 01:21:30.968
Trust me, love. All these woes
shall serve for sweet discourses...

01:21:31.059 --> 01:21:33.466
...in our times to come.
- Ho, daughter!

01:21:37.565 --> 01:21:38.597
Juliet!

01:21:49.703 --> 01:21:51.447
O God!

01:21:51.538 --> 01:21:53.827
I have an ill-divining soul!

01:21:53.916 --> 01:21:56.407
Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low...

01:21:56.502 --> 01:21:58.542
...as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.

01:22:00.548 --> 01:22:03.121
Adieu!

01:22:03.676 --> 01:22:05.420
O fortune, fortune!

01:22:05.511 --> 01:22:07.385
Be fickle, fortune.

01:22:07.472 --> 01:22:11.517
For then I hope thou wilt not
keep him long, but send him back.

01:22:22.362 --> 01:22:24.569
Thou hast a careful father, child.

01:22:24.656 --> 01:22:27.860
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness...

01:22:27.951 --> 01:22:31.155
...hath sorted out a sudden day ofjoy...

01:22:31.747 --> 01:22:35.412
...which thou expect'st not,
nor I looked not for.

01:22:36.419 --> 01:22:38.826
Madam, in happy time. What day is that?

01:22:38.921 --> 01:22:42.088
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn...

01:22:42.175 --> 01:22:45.342
...the gallant, young,
and noble gentleman, Sir Paris...

01:22:45.428 --> 01:22:48.797
...at St Peter's Church,
shall happily make thee there...

01:22:48.890 --> 01:22:50.135
...ajoyful bride.

01:22:55.605 --> 01:22:58.606
Now, by St Peter's Church and Peter too...

01:22:58.692 --> 01:23:01.729
...he shall not make me there ajoyful bride!

01:23:02.821 --> 01:23:05.277
Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself.

01:23:05.366 --> 01:23:07.323
How now, wife?

01:23:07.409 --> 01:23:09.948
Have you delivered to her our decree?

01:23:10.037 --> 01:23:11.413
Ay, sir.

01:23:11.497 --> 01:23:13.905
But she will none, she gives you thanks.

01:23:14.917 --> 01:23:18.037
I would the fool were married to her grave.

01:23:21.466 --> 01:23:22.925
How?

01:23:23.009 --> 01:23:25.085
Will she none?

01:23:25.178 --> 01:23:27.254
Is she not proud?

01:23:27.639 --> 01:23:31.090
Doth she not count her blest,
unworthy as she is...

01:23:31.184 --> 01:23:34.553
...that we have wrought so worthy
a gentleman to be her bride?

01:23:35.063 --> 01:23:38.397
Not proud you have,
but thankful that you have.

01:23:38.484 --> 01:23:41.354
Proud can I never be of what I hate!

01:23:41.445 --> 01:23:44.446
Thank me no thankings,
nor proud me no prouds!

01:23:44.532 --> 01:23:47.948
But fettle your fine joints
'gainst Thursday next!

01:23:48.035 --> 01:23:50.075
Hear me with patience but to speak a word!

01:23:50.163 --> 01:23:51.111
No!

01:23:51.205 --> 01:23:52.237
Fie, fie! Stop it!

01:23:52.331 --> 01:23:55.083
Speak not! Reply not! Do not answer me!

01:23:55.168 --> 01:23:56.876
Husband, are you mad?

01:23:59.381 --> 01:24:02.714
Hang thee, young baggage!
Disobedient wretch!

01:24:02.801 --> 01:24:05.968
God in heaven bless her! You are
to blame, my lord, to rate her so!

01:24:06.054 --> 01:24:08.011
Peace, you mumbling fool!

01:24:08.098 --> 01:24:09.925
I tell thee what.

01:24:10.017 --> 01:24:12.306
Get thee to church o' Thursday...

01:24:12.394 --> 01:24:14.802
...or never after look me in the face!

01:24:14.897 --> 01:24:17.684
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend.

01:24:17.775 --> 01:24:20.859
An you be not, hang, beg, starve...

01:24:20.945 --> 01:24:22.937
...die in the streets!

01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:24.774
Trust to 't. Bethink you.

01:24:24.866 --> 01:24:26.942
I'll not be forsworn!

01:24:38.505 --> 01:24:42.966
O sweet my mother, cast me not away!

01:24:44.219 --> 01:24:47.173
Delay this marriage for a month, a week.

01:24:47.264 --> 01:24:48.889
Or, if you do not...

01:24:48.974 --> 01:24:52.343
...make the bridal bed in that
dim monument where Tybalt lies.

01:24:54.438 --> 01:24:56.265
Talk not to me...

01:24:58.317 --> 01:25:00.393
...for I'll not speak a word.

01:25:01.237 --> 01:25:04.238
Do as thou wilt,
for I have done with thee.

01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:17.120
O God!

01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:19.964
O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?

01:25:21.884 --> 01:25:26.380
What say'st thou? Hast thou not
a word ofjoy? Some comfort, Nurse!

01:25:27.264 --> 01:25:29.340
Faith, here it is.

01:25:30.476 --> 01:25:34.390
I think it best you marry with this Paris.

01:25:35.815 --> 01:25:37.891
O he's a lovely gentleman.

01:25:41.571 --> 01:25:44.940
I think you are happy in this second match...

01:25:45.867 --> 01:25:47.943
...for it excels your first.

01:25:49.037 --> 01:25:51.113
Or, if it did not...

01:25:51.206 --> 01:25:53.495
...your first is dead.

01:25:58.672 --> 01:26:00.748
Or 'twere as good he were...

01:26:00.841 --> 01:26:03.676
...as living here and you no use to him.

01:26:07.473 --> 01:26:09.679
Speakest thou from thy heart?

01:26:11.018 --> 01:26:14.518
And from my soul too;
else beshrew them both!

01:26:16.566 --> 01:26:18.226
Amen.

01:26:18.318 --> 01:26:19.978
What?

01:26:23.198 --> 01:26:26.234
Well, thou hast comforted me
marvellous much.

01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:32.120
Go in and tell my lady I am gone,
having displeased my father...

01:26:32.207 --> 01:26:36.371
...to Friar Laurence to make
confession and be absolved.

01:26:41.801 --> 01:26:45.004
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death.

01:26:45.096 --> 01:26:47.883
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous...

01:26:47.974 --> 01:26:50.891
...that she doth give her sorrow
so much sway...

01:26:50.977 --> 01:26:56.351
...and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
to stop the inundation of her tears.

01:26:56.441 --> 01:26:57.816
(door opens)

01:26:59.527 --> 01:27:02.528
Happily met, my lady and my wife.

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:05.565
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

01:27:05.659 --> 01:27:08.446
That "may be" must be, love,
on Thursday next.

01:27:08.537 --> 01:27:12.487
- What must be shall be.
- Well, that's a certain text.

01:27:13.542 --> 01:27:15.665
Come you to make confession?

01:27:15.753 --> 01:27:20.000
Are you at leisure, holy Father, now,
or shall I come to you at evening mass?

01:27:20.091 --> 01:27:23.626
My leisure serves thee,
pensive daughter, now.

01:27:23.719 --> 01:27:26.720
Good sir, we must entreat the time alone.

01:27:27.223 --> 01:27:30.058
God shield I should disturb devotion!

01:27:33.855 --> 01:27:38.067
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.

01:27:39.152 --> 01:27:41.192
Till then adieu...

01:27:41.279 --> 01:27:43.356
...and keep this holy kiss.

01:27:51.957 --> 01:27:53.997
Tell me not, Father,
that thou hearest of this...

01:27:54.085 --> 01:27:57.952
...unless thou tell me how I may prevent it!
- It strains me past the compass of my wits!

01:27:58.047 --> 01:28:00.040
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help...

01:28:00.133 --> 01:28:01.959
...do thou but call my resolution wise.

01:28:02.051 --> 01:28:04.803
- And with this, I'll help it presently!
- Hold, daughter!

01:28:04.888 --> 01:28:08.221
Be not so long to speak! I long to die!

01:28:09.392 --> 01:28:12.062
I do spy a kind of hope...

01:28:12.145 --> 01:28:14.352
...which craves as desperate an execution...

01:28:14.439 --> 01:28:16.728
...as that is desperate
which we would prevent.

01:28:16.817 --> 01:28:19.106
lf, rather than to marry with this Paris...

01:28:19.194 --> 01:28:21.946
...thou hast the strength of will
to slay thyself...

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:25.863
...then it is likely thou wilt
undertake a thing like death...

01:28:25.951 --> 01:28:28.869
...to chide away this shame.

01:28:29.705 --> 01:28:31.781
And, if thou darest...

01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:34.826
...l'll give thee remedy.

01:28:36.504 --> 01:28:40.372
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.

01:28:40.466 --> 01:28:43.136
Each part,
deprived of supple government...

01:28:43.219 --> 01:28:46.339
...shall stiff and stark and cold
appear, like death.

01:28:46.723 --> 01:28:51.100
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning
comes to rouse thee from thy bed...

01:28:51.186 --> 01:28:53.262
...there art thou dead.

01:28:53.355 --> 01:28:55.395
Thou shalt be borne
to that same ancient vault...

01:28:55.482 --> 01:28:57.356
...where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.

01:28:57.443 --> 01:29:00.147
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death...

01:29:00.237 --> 01:29:02.811
...thou shalt continue
four and twenty hours...

01:29:02.907 --> 01:29:05.528
...and then awake as from a pleasant sleep.

01:29:05.618 --> 01:29:08.323
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake...

01:29:08.412 --> 01:29:10.950
...shall Romeo by my letters know our drift.

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:16.035
And hither shall he come that very night
to bear thee both hence to Mantua.

01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:19.037
Take thou this vial, being then in bed...

01:29:19.132 --> 01:29:21.753
...and this distilling liquor drink thou off.

01:29:21.843 --> 01:29:26.256
I'll send my letters to thy lord
post haste to Mantua.

01:29:37.359 --> 01:29:38.688
(knocking)

01:29:38.777 --> 01:29:40.153
Hello?

01:30:03.261 --> 01:30:05.669
What if this mixture do not work at all?

01:30:05.764 --> 01:30:08.884
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?

01:30:11.353 --> 01:30:12.384
(door opens)

01:30:12.479 --> 01:30:15.683
- What, are you busy? Need you my help?
- No, madam.

01:30:15.775 --> 01:30:19.274
We have culled such necessaries
as are behoveful for our estate tomorrow.

01:30:19.362 --> 01:30:23.146
So please you, let me now be left alone,
and let the nurse this night sit up with you.

01:30:23.241 --> 01:30:25.447
For I am sure you have your hands full all...

01:30:25.535 --> 01:30:27.243
...in this so sudden business.

01:30:27.328 --> 01:30:28.871
Good night.

01:30:28.955 --> 01:30:31.031
Get thee to bed and rest...

01:30:32.042 --> 01:30:34.283
...for thou hast need.

01:30:40.759 --> 01:30:42.170
Farewell.

01:30:45.264 --> 01:30:47.837
God knows when we shall meet again.

01:30:50.477 --> 01:30:51.853
Good night.

01:31:05.410 --> 01:31:07.486
Romeo...

01:31:07.579 --> 01:31:09.737
...I drink to thee.

01:31:27.224 --> 01:31:34.770
â™ª Requiem...

01:31:40.363 --> 01:31:44.361
As the custom is, in all her best array,
bear her to church.

01:32:11.437 --> 01:32:13.513
(bell tolls)

01:32:41.677 --> 01:32:44.678
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit...

01:32:44.764 --> 01:32:48.596
...lifts me above the ground
with cheerful thoughts.

01:32:48.685 --> 01:32:51.223
I dreamt my lady came
and found me dead...

01:32:51.312 --> 01:32:55.262
...and breathed such life with kisses
in my lips that I revived...

01:32:55.358 --> 01:32:57.434
...and was an emperor.

01:32:58.528 --> 01:33:00.604
Ah me!

01:33:00.697 --> 01:33:03.271
How sweet is love itself possessed...

01:33:03.367 --> 01:33:06.652
...when but love's shadows
are so rich in joy!

01:33:24.389 --> 01:33:26.049
News from Verona!

01:33:34.649 --> 01:33:35.894
How now, Balthasar?

01:33:35.984 --> 01:33:38.938
Dost thou not bring me
letters from the priest?

01:33:39.029 --> 01:33:41.602
How doth my lady? Is my father well?

01:33:42.825 --> 01:33:46.573
How doth my lady Juliet?
For nothing can be ill if she be well.

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:52.161
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.

01:34:00.009 --> 01:34:02.085
Her body rests in chapel monument...

01:34:02.178 --> 01:34:05.428
...and her immortal part
with the angels lives.

01:34:06.182 --> 01:34:08.258
I saw her laid low.

01:34:09.269 --> 01:34:11.890
Pardon me for bringing these ill news.

01:34:17.903 --> 01:34:19.979
Is it e'en so?

01:34:43.763 --> 01:34:46.468
Then I defy you, stars!

01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:01.440
Juliet!

01:35:02.908 --> 01:35:05.067
Juliet!

01:35:38.988 --> 01:35:42.523
- I will hence tonight.
- Have patience!

01:35:46.537 --> 01:35:48.080
Leave me!

01:35:48.164 --> 01:35:51.082
Your looks are pale and wild
and do import some misadventure.

01:35:51.167 --> 01:35:53.041
Tush! Thou art deceived!

01:35:54.087 --> 01:35:57.207
Hast thou no letters to me from the priest?

01:36:08.769 --> 01:36:10.845
No matter.

01:36:14.859 --> 01:36:16.935
Well, Juliet...

01:36:18.404 --> 01:36:20.693
...I will lie with thee tonight.

01:36:24.911 --> 01:36:26.987
I will hence tonight.

01:37:05.203 --> 01:37:08.786
(police radio)
Romeo is within Verona walls.

01:37:17.883 --> 01:37:19.342
Fear comes upon me!

01:37:19.843 --> 01:37:21.883
O, much I fear...

01:37:21.971 --> 01:37:25.554
...some ill, unthrifty thing!

01:37:28.185 --> 01:37:29.929
The letter was of dear import!

01:37:31.105 --> 01:37:33.596
I couldn't send it,
nor get a messenger to bring it thee.

01:37:34.901 --> 01:37:36.858
The neglecting it may do much damage.

01:37:36.945 --> 01:37:39.400
Bring forth these enemies,
Capulet and Montague!

01:37:49.958 --> 01:37:51.583
(knocking)

01:37:52.753 --> 01:37:54.212
Let me have a dram of poison...

01:37:54.296 --> 01:37:58.626
...such soon-speeding gear as will
disperse itself through all the veins...

01:37:58.717 --> 01:38:00.840
...that the life-weary taker may fall dead.

01:38:00.928 --> 01:38:05.258
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona law
is death to any he that utters them.

01:38:05.349 --> 01:38:08.469
The world is not thy friend,
nor the world's law!

01:38:08.561 --> 01:38:10.601
Then be not poor, but break it...

01:38:10.688 --> 01:38:12.562
...and take this!

01:38:14.275 --> 01:38:16.945
My poverty but not my will consents.

01:38:17.570 --> 01:38:20.607
I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

01:38:31.877 --> 01:38:34.202
Drink it off...

01:38:34.296 --> 01:38:38.294
...and if you had the strength of 20 men,
it would dispatch you straight.

01:38:38.384 --> 01:38:40.044
There's my gold.

01:38:40.136 --> 01:38:42.010
(helicopter)

01:38:43.222 --> 01:38:45.298
Worse poison to men's souls...

01:38:45.391 --> 01:38:49.092
...than these poor compounds
that thou may'st not sell.

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:15.921
Romeo hath no notice of these accidents.

01:39:16.591 --> 01:39:18.714
I will write again to Mantua.

01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:26.892
Within the hour will the fair Juliet wake.

01:39:26.976 --> 01:39:29.053
She stirs. The lady stirs.

01:39:38.071 --> 01:39:41.690
- I do beseech you.
- Live and be prosperous.

01:39:42.701 --> 01:39:44.777
And farewell, good fellow.

01:39:45.454 --> 01:39:46.996
Then I will leave thee.

01:39:58.843 --> 01:39:59.922
(sirens)

01:40:25.621 --> 01:40:27.495
Tempt not a desperate man!

01:40:34.797 --> 01:40:36.292
Hold! Hold!

01:40:37.384 --> 01:40:38.463
(gunshots)

01:40:38.635 --> 01:40:39.666
Hold!

01:40:46.059 --> 01:40:48.432
(Prince) Once more I say to you, hold!

01:40:55.945 --> 01:40:58.021
(panting)

01:43:54.632 --> 01:43:56.708
My love...

01:43:57.802 --> 01:43:59.878
My wife...

01:44:00.513 --> 01:44:03.384
Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath...

01:44:03.474 --> 01:44:06.262
...hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

01:44:09.063 --> 01:44:11.140
Thou art not conquered.

01:44:15.403 --> 01:44:20.445
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson
in thy lips and in thy cheeks...

01:44:21.034 --> 01:44:24.403
...and death's pale flag is not advanced there.

01:44:36.842 --> 01:44:41.090
Dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair?

01:44:43.725 --> 01:44:47.557
Shall I believe that
unsubstantial death is amorous...

01:44:47.645 --> 01:44:50.979
...and keeps thee here in dark
to be his paramour?

01:45:29.898 --> 01:45:31.309
Here.

01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:34.603
O, here will I set up my everlasting rest...

01:45:36.488 --> 01:45:42.194
...and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh.

01:45:50.002 --> 01:45:52.079
Eyes, look your last.

01:45:54.883 --> 01:45:57.089
Arms, take your last embrace.

01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:06.720
And lips...

01:46:07.854 --> 01:46:10.061
O you, the doors to breath...

01:46:13.902 --> 01:46:16.228
...seal with a righteous kiss...

01:46:38.386 --> 01:46:40.463
...a dateless bargain...

01:46:41.014 --> 01:46:43.054
...to engrossing death.

01:46:48.105 --> 01:46:49.516
Romeo...

01:46:50.733 --> 01:46:52.606
(gasping)

01:47:01.619 --> 01:47:03.244
What's here?

01:47:06.916 --> 01:47:08.114
Poison...

01:47:09.919 --> 01:47:13.335
Drunk all, and left no friendly drop
to help me after?

01:47:18.345 --> 01:47:20.421
I'll kiss thy lips.

01:47:20.514 --> 01:47:23.219
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them.

01:47:28.230 --> 01:47:30.306
Thy lips are warm.

01:47:46.207 --> 01:47:47.867
Thus...

01:47:49.085 --> 01:47:51.162
...with a kiss...

01:47:55.217 --> 01:47:57.293
...I die.

01:50:10.150 --> 01:50:11.395
(gunshot)

01:50:19.117 --> 01:50:22.321
(â™ª "Tristan and Isolde" by Wagner)

01:52:00.015 --> 01:52:03.300
See what a scourge
is laid upon your hate...

01:52:03.393 --> 01:52:07.059
...that heaven finds means
to kill yourjoys with love!

01:52:07.898 --> 01:52:12.560
And l, for winking at your discords too,
have lost a brace of kinsmen.

01:52:16.615 --> 01:52:18.692
All are punished.

01:52:26.125 --> 01:52:29.910
All are punished!

01:52:33.633 --> 01:52:37.417
(TV) A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.

01:52:37.512 --> 01:52:40.597
The sun for sorrow
will not show his head.

01:52:40.682 --> 01:52:44.134
Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.

01:52:44.895 --> 01:52:48.229
Some shall be pardoned,
and some punished.

01:52:48.858 --> 01:52:55.821
For never was a story of more woe
than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
