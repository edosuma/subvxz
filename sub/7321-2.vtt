WEBVTT

00:14.914 --> 00:16.381
What are you doing?

00:17.984 --> 00:19.508
Eating cereal.

00:19.552 --> 00:21.213
I got us a chicken for dinner.

00:21.254 --> 00:24.155
Chicken? Seriously?

00:24.190 --> 00:26.317
You're not gonna be hungry now.

00:26.359 --> 00:29.692
You're doing it all wrong,
again, as usual.

00:29.729 --> 00:32.162
I'm not. I'm cutting
from the media steinum out.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.224
You can't see the media steinum
without your glasses.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.227
Damn. Where are my glasses?

00:41.875 --> 00:44.935
No, put it down. Put it down.

00:46.112 --> 00:48.478
Right here. Right here.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.180
Move.

00:59.759 --> 01:02.557
What would I do without you?

01:03.263 --> 01:04.821
Starve.

01:11.638 --> 01:13.401
Damsel in distress.

01:14.908 --> 01:15.932
Come on.

01:21.648 --> 01:25.084
Put her on a monitor, order a
portable chest. Gonna cut your top.

01:25.118 --> 01:27.109
Between my ninth and tenth
intercostal spaces.

01:27.153 --> 01:30.589
No hemo or pneumothorax,
vitals are stable. Pull it.

01:30.623 --> 01:32.523
- I wouldn't.
- Mind your business.

01:32.559 --> 01:34.925
- Who is this guy?
- Get this thing out of me.

01:34.961 --> 01:36.792
I screwed up in front of the chief.

01:36.830 --> 01:41.290
I messed up a suture and now he's
looking at me like I am number 12.

01:41.334 --> 01:43.928
Mer, please, no one gets
to see me like this. OK?

01:43.970 --> 01:47.030
Yang! What the hell happened?
Get her on a monitor,

01:47.073 --> 01:48.973
- order a portable chest...
- I did.

01:49.008 --> 01:51.533
- Check her respiratory funct...
- I did. See?

01:51.578 --> 01:53.273
Breath sounds clear and equal.

01:53.313 --> 01:56.214
Quiet. What would you advise
as course of treatment?

01:56.249 --> 01:59.013
We leave it in until we get
the chest X-ray and CT back.

01:59.052 --> 02:02.021
- I'm fine.
- What about infection? This is melting

02:02.055 --> 02:04.285
- dirty roof water into her body.
- Pull it out!

02:04.324 --> 02:08.192
Leave it. You get stabbed in the chest,
lucky enough to still be breathing,

02:08.228 --> 02:11.823
you leave the knife in until you
figure out what's going on. Leave it.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.162
- Take it out.
- Leave it.

02:13.199 --> 02:16.430
Since you know so much,
teach your interns to treat you.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.960
This is an opportunity
to get back to the basics.

02:19.005 --> 02:22.805
- I need to check on Vincent Kenner.
- Kenner is your responsibility now.

02:22.842 --> 02:25.777
Bear in mind he is my patient,
and I am not about to lose

02:25.812 --> 02:28.610
another trauma case today.
Keep that man alive.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.582
Can I get a word with you, Dr. Hunt?

02:32.819 --> 02:35.287
Think you'll be able
to restore her memory?

02:35.321 --> 02:37.812
I was able to suction blood
and remove the pressure.

02:37.857 --> 02:39.984
Hopeful. Not certain, but hopeful.

02:40.026 --> 02:41.789
Fifteen blade, please. Ow!

02:43.496 --> 02:45.987
- Something wrong, Dr. Shepherd?
- Oh, my God.

02:46.933 --> 02:49.128
Dr. Hahn asked about teaching before.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.002
When you get a surgeon a blade,
make sure it's handle first.

02:52.038 --> 02:54.666
Suction the bleeders
while I clean and get a glove.

03:03.349 --> 03:06.716
- He's really gonna be OK?
- Except for his voice.

03:06.753 --> 03:09.881
His abdomen's definitely tender.
He needs another CT.

03:09.923 --> 03:13.256
Michael, the insurance,
it's a mistake, right?

03:13.293 --> 03:16.990
It's gotta be a mistake. Write down
a name and a number and I'll fix it.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.123
Everything will be fine, right?

03:19.165 --> 03:21.326
Everything's gonna be fine?

03:30.276 --> 03:32.608
Maybe later would be better.

03:32.645 --> 03:35.409
Sarabeth, come on, honey.

03:47.927 --> 03:51.920
- What's going on?
- We're going ahead with the freezing.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.490
Without my consent?
No, I don't think so.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.094
Wanna be the doctor who doesn't
give his all to keep

03:57.136 --> 03:59.696
- a man from being wheelchair-bound?
- Get out!

03:59.739 --> 04:01.434
Don't take orders from civilians.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.135
- You arrogant...
- Shepherd.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.804
Now this patient is stable,
he may never walk.

04:05.845 --> 04:09.474
If you try this, he could throw a clot,
have organ failure and die.

04:10.149 --> 04:12.310
We're going ahead with the freezing.

04:14.287 --> 04:18.053
Ever since this morning, you've been
pissing on everything with a pulse

04:18.091 --> 04:20.616
trying to prove you're not number 12.

04:20.660 --> 04:21.786
And you're not.

04:21.827 --> 04:26.265
But right now, with this decision,
you act like number 12.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.528
Good luck with the patient, Dr. Torres.

04:43.283 --> 04:47.185
The chief's under the spell
of some insane man in camouflage.

04:47.220 --> 04:51.850
He saved my patient's life. He'll never
talk again but, still, life saved.

04:51.891 --> 04:57.796
- What happened to your hand?
- Scalpel. Rose. Not intentional.

04:57.830 --> 05:00.594
She's a dead mouse on the kitchen floor.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.261
At some point you gotta
pick it up and throw it away.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.703
- Want me to look?
- Mer's gonna take care of it.

05:05.738 --> 05:07.433
I'm a renowned plastic surgeon.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.532
- Grey's a resident.
- She gives me sex.

05:09.575 --> 05:11.270
Especially when I'm wounded.

05:12.512 --> 05:15.379
Oh! Oh...

05:16.182 --> 05:17.649
Is this positioned right?

05:17.684 --> 05:21.620
If I'm getting a mammogram.
Lower, to the right.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.646
- Two, what are you doing?
- Draping so your parts are safe.

05:24.691 --> 05:26.283
Get away from my parts.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.920
Oh. Gentle, gentle, gentle.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.856
- How are you doing?
- Please take my films

05:31.898 --> 05:34.025
'cause my interns are idiots!

05:34.267 --> 05:35.757
How's Mr. Kenner?

05:35.802 --> 05:37.667
- Stable.
- You cannot let him die.

05:37.704 --> 05:40.764
- I'm doing my best, hold still.
- I am. Just shoot it.

05:42.241 --> 05:45.176
Hold still because
I wanna ask you a question.

05:45.244 --> 05:46.336
What?

05:46.379 --> 05:48.677
Did you mean what you said
about me and Derek?

05:48.715 --> 05:53.084
- Well, this is not fair. I'm impaled.
- I know I talk about it too much.

05:53.119 --> 05:57.988
I've gone soft and gooey and disgusting
and if I had to listen, I'd puke too.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.857
But you said what you said
because you were mad, right?

06:00.893 --> 06:02.622
Not because you meant it?

06:04.263 --> 06:08.393
Just take my X-ray and...
It doesn't matter what I say.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.459
Of course it matters what you say!

06:12.972 --> 06:15.873
Of course it matters.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.693
You stop... Oh!

06:34.727 --> 06:37.457
Stop taking my picture,
and take my picture!

06:43.970 --> 06:45.335
Anna.

06:49.609 --> 06:51.270
Are you feeling OK?

06:52.478 --> 06:55.413
Her world is about to fall apart
and she has no idea.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.543
It's all my fault.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.450
What should I do?

07:01.487 --> 07:06.083
I know I'm a terrible person,
but what should I do?

07:09.996 --> 07:11.623
She should hear it from you.

07:14.100 --> 07:18.230
You're her best friend. Even if it's
the most terrible thing in the world...

07:19.071 --> 07:20.868
...you should tell her.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.000
Hey.

07:24.544 --> 07:28.105
Callie's gonna freeze her patient.
Wanna go check it out?

07:28.481 --> 07:32.315
Hello? Alex?
Why are you ignoring me?

07:32.351 --> 07:34.285
I'm hoping if I wait long enough

07:34.320 --> 07:37.778
you'll be as annoyed by the sound
of your voice as I am and shut up.

07:42.395 --> 07:45.421
OK... Did I do something?

07:45.465 --> 07:48.127
- You know what you did.
- No. I don't.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.533
- Alex, just tell me, what did I do?
- Shut up.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.162
I had a bad night and cried like a girl.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.366
I'm over it.
You need to get over it too.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.105
That chill you'll feel is cold saline

08:03.149 --> 08:06.050
rushing through your veins
to lower your core body temperature.

08:06.085 --> 08:07.814
And if it works, I walk?

08:07.854 --> 08:11.517
If it works, the hope is that you walk.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.519
Wow... OK...

08:15.561 --> 08:17.495
I'm getting cold.

08:17.530 --> 08:20.795
His temp's still 96.8.
Shall we lay another cooling blanket?

08:20.833 --> 08:22.801
Up to you, Dr. Torres,
you're taking point.

08:22.835 --> 08:26.271
That's what the chief of
a number one teaching hospital does,

08:26.305 --> 08:30.401
he hand picks talented surgeons and
lets them take point. Right, Dr. Bailey?

08:30.443 --> 08:33.775
- Couldn't agree more.
- Warm and toasty's what I'm feelin'.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.407
His pulse is falling. Are you sure?

08:37.450 --> 08:40.283
- Down to 52.
- It's normal for his pulse to fall.

08:40.318 --> 08:42.116
How much
longer do we got?

08:42.154 --> 08:44.212
Not too much longer.
You're doing great.

08:44.256 --> 08:47.624
- Keep thinking warm and toasty.
- OK. I'm trying.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.218
Good.

08:49.929 --> 08:52.693
Number 12, my ass.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.401
You wanna hear how I cut my hand?

08:56.435 --> 08:58.130
It's a good story.

08:58.905 --> 09:02.341
I am not sure moving in together
is a good idea.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.037
OK. Fine.

09:05.077 --> 09:08.012
- Fine? What does that mean?
- It means that I know you.

09:08.047 --> 09:11.414
- Didn't believe I'd let you move in?
- I believe you believe it.

09:11.450 --> 09:14.613
Look, I'm gonna move very slowly.
Baby steps.

09:14.654 --> 09:17.020
No sudden moves.
You're like a deer in the woods.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.546
OK, I built the house of candles.

09:18.591 --> 09:21.389
It's unprecedented
in the <i>Meredith Chronicles.</i>

09:21.427 --> 09:23.918
- Fine. Let's move in together.
- Fine.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.988
Unless you wanna go ahead
and get married.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.133
Gotcha.
Wanna know where I learned that?

09:31.170 --> 09:33.331
Goes with the story
of how I cut my hand.

09:33.372 --> 09:35.272
What did you say to Alex?

09:35.308 --> 09:37.674
I... I didn't say anything.

09:37.710 --> 09:42.704
I just said that I think it's nice
that you two are friendly again.

09:42.748 --> 09:46.514
Why can't you mind your own business?
I should have never told you.

09:46.552 --> 09:49.578
Can't keep anything to yourself
unless it's for Cristina.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.021
Izzie.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.250
- Marriage?
- Not funny.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.596
Dr. Bailey.

10:02.468 --> 10:05.266
- Yeah?
- Mr. Briar's abdomen is more tender.

10:05.304 --> 10:09.764
I know I'm supposed to get a CT, but
if we start the surgery after midnight

10:09.809 --> 10:13.802
he's not covered and we're
bankrupting him. I say we skip the CT.

10:13.846 --> 10:16.280
You say? You say?
No, you don't say. You ask.

10:16.315 --> 10:20.149
And the answer is we don't skimp on
medicine to save money. Get the CT.

10:20.186 --> 10:24.418
Doing great. Giving you more sedative
and a paralytic to stop your shivering.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.322
OK. OK.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.691
- We'll need to intubate, Bailey.
- Coming down.

10:31.731 --> 10:34.495
One, two and three.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.160
And down.

10:38.337 --> 10:40.805
He's down to 90 degrees.
I think that's too low.

10:40.840 --> 10:44.207
- Is that too low?
- You did all the research.

10:44.243 --> 10:48.179
I think it's too low.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.682
- Oh, God.
- OK, so, what now?

10:50.716 --> 10:55.676
Is this going to resolve?
Did they recommend lido or amiodarone?

10:55.721 --> 10:57.621
Dr. Torres?!

11:00.059 --> 11:03.551
- Dr. Torres?
- He's barely got a pulse.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.325
Uh, should we do CPR?

11:05.364 --> 11:09.824
No! Let's try to avoid jostling
Shepherd's spinal decompression

11:09.869 --> 11:11.996
unless absolutely necessary.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.005
- Crap.
- His heart is likely to stop.

11:16.042 --> 11:20.775
- Soon. What are you gonna do, Torres?
- I don't know.

11:22.581 --> 11:24.572
I don't know.

11:28.654 --> 11:29.951
How is he?

11:29.989 --> 11:32.719
Given him medication
to keep his blood pressure up,

11:32.758 --> 11:35.921
but Betty's husband is not
as stable as we'd like him to be.

11:50.109 --> 11:52.543
They're freezing Phillip.

11:52.578 --> 11:54.205
Freezing him.

11:55.147 --> 11:58.116
To try to help him walk again.
I don't...

11:58.150 --> 12:00.141
They explained it to me very well...

12:01.520 --> 12:03.954
And Betty's having surgery on her brain.

12:03.989 --> 12:07.447
And poor Vincent here
is barely hanging on.

12:07.493 --> 12:10.587
- And Michael...
- It's all right.

12:10.629 --> 12:14.087
We'll survive. We always do.

12:16.168 --> 12:19.103
I wish he would just look at me.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.700
Sarabeth...

12:26.512 --> 12:30.380
Michael lost his job eight months ago.

12:32.918 --> 12:36.820
- What?
- The firm let him go.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.824
He just...

12:38.858 --> 12:41.088
He couldn't bring himself to tell you.

12:41.127 --> 12:43.493
He just felt like such a failure.

12:44.663 --> 12:46.324
What...? I don't...

12:46.365 --> 12:49.493
Why do you... How do you know this?

12:57.143 --> 12:58.974
He told you.

13:02.681 --> 13:04.376
He told you.

13:06.051 --> 13:07.882
Sarabeth...

13:09.121 --> 13:10.679
Anna...

13:12.124 --> 13:15.287
Have you been sleeping
with my husband?

13:15.327 --> 13:18.626
- I'm sorry...
- He's in V-fib. Code blue!

13:19.965 --> 13:23.128
Get them out of here, please.

13:36.348 --> 13:41.012
You started him on ECMO? You're
taking out his blood and replacing it?

13:41.053 --> 13:44.454
It was the only thing to do.
We don't want to jostle his spine.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.048
This'll give his heart rest.

13:46.091 --> 13:49.857
We need you to monitor him until we
get him back on. Now are you in or not?

14:04.944 --> 14:06.809
I sent Michael down for the CT.

14:06.846 --> 14:11.715
I was hoping we could start the surgery.
Get him in under the wire.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.685
But it's almost midnight, so...

14:15.821 --> 14:18.221
It doesn't matter,
I don't care. I don't.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.826
Do you know anything
about Betty's husband?

14:22.862 --> 14:27.492
He... I think he was dying.
Have you heard anything?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.831
No, I can find out.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.100
Why do men cheat?

14:33.439 --> 14:35.703
My husband slept with my friend.

14:37.176 --> 14:40.145
He lost his job, and then
he slept with my friend,

14:40.179 --> 14:43.046
all the while telling me he loves me.

14:45.484 --> 14:46.883
Why?

14:49.188 --> 14:52.157
Maybe he was low.

14:53.125 --> 14:56.583
He was down and he didn't
want you to see him like that.

14:56.629 --> 15:00.292
In pain. Weak. As less than a man.

15:00.332 --> 15:04.063
He has his pride so he turned away.

15:05.471 --> 15:07.769
It's not right, but it...

15:07.806 --> 15:10.707
It doesn't mean
he doesn't care about you.

15:11.543 --> 15:13.374
I swear it doesn't.

15:28.494 --> 15:31.292
- All right, we all ready to wean?
- Let's do it.

15:43.175 --> 15:45.439
It looks like he's tachycardic.

15:45.477 --> 15:47.775
Should we shock him?
Give him adenosine?

15:47.813 --> 15:50.441
Normally I'd say yes,
but this man's an ice cube.

15:50.482 --> 15:55.852
Torres, in any of your research, was
there anything to suggest what to do?

15:55.888 --> 15:59.016
I mean, um...
I think I messed up here.

15:59.058 --> 16:03.495
I don't... I don't know.
Maybe he would've been fine on his own.

16:03.529 --> 16:06.089
- Maybe...
- All right, look at me. Look at me.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.532
Focus. You're trying something new.
Nothing wrong with new.

16:09.568 --> 16:12.935
Breaking new ground,
pushing boundaries comes with the job.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.339
So, Dr. Torres, take a breath,

16:16.375 --> 16:21.540
stop panicking and just tell us.
What did your research say?

16:23.849 --> 16:26.044
My research showed that...

16:27.052 --> 16:32.581
That arrhythmias
can occur at a certain threshold.

16:32.624 --> 16:36.685
His appears to be between

16:36.729 --> 16:40.961
- 91.5 and 92 degrees.
- He's around 90 right now.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.901
We could use the ECMO
to help bring him back up.

16:43.936 --> 16:48.202
Yes, but not too quickly because
that can cause problems of its own.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.834
All right, looks like we have
some warming to do.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.275
What do you see?

17:00.319 --> 17:03.186
Uh, it kinda looks like
it's hitting nothing.

17:03.222 --> 17:07.556
Oh. It looks like it's hitting nothing
because it's hitting nothing!

17:07.593 --> 17:09.992
- So what does that mean?
- What do you mean,

17:10.029 --> 17:13.430
"What does that mean?"
Don't you know how to read an X-ray?

17:13.464 --> 17:16.525
- You always read them.
- Oh, get out.

17:16.568 --> 17:20.936
All of you just get out
and find me someone with a brain.

17:26.111 --> 17:30.138
Those your interns?
Seem pretty scared of you.

17:30.182 --> 17:31.581
I am not scary.

17:36.688 --> 17:38.121
What are you doing?

17:46.832 --> 17:49.824
- That's my icicle.
- Yeah.

17:49.868 --> 17:51.165
You took out my icicle.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.234
I didn't give you
permission to do that.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.639
So?

18:00.479 --> 18:01.503
Cristina.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.642
He died.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.588
- Patient still alive?
- He's stable.

18:13.759 --> 18:17.320
Let some soldier talk you into
something that could've killed a man.

18:17.362 --> 18:19.626
- He deserved the chance.
- No way of knowing

18:19.665 --> 18:22.190
- if it helped or hurt.
- He deserved a chance.

18:22.234 --> 18:26.432
He deserved the best, the most
that this hospital could give him.

18:26.472 --> 18:30.169
I've let a lot of things
slide over the past few years.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.871
I've been...

18:32.911 --> 18:35.573
- ...soft
- This was not about you being soft.

18:35.614 --> 18:40.074
I think it's the fact that Meredith
is here, that Ellis's daughter is here.

18:42.921 --> 18:44.388
Chief...

18:45.190 --> 18:46.623
Vincent Kenner.

18:46.658 --> 18:49.957
We gave him 31 units of blood,
fresh frozen plasma,

18:49.995 --> 18:53.158
multiple liters of LR...
We did everything we knew to do,

18:53.198 --> 18:54.825
we couldn't bring him back.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.202
You don't know how to do anything.

19:06.011 --> 19:07.308
None of you.

19:07.846 --> 19:10.747
You're halfway through
your second year of residency,

19:10.782 --> 19:14.650
and you walk around here like it's
your God-given right to be here.

19:14.686 --> 19:18.782
Well, it is not, Dr. Grey, I assure you.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.384
You are here because I allow it.

19:21.426 --> 19:25.829
You are here to do what I say.
And the one thing I asked you to do...

19:25.864 --> 19:27.764
- You can't even save...
- Richard!

19:27.799 --> 19:29.926
We can't save everybody.

19:35.474 --> 19:37.533
We should try harder.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.610
We should try harder.

19:53.392 --> 19:55.553
Michael, Sarabeth is here.

19:55.594 --> 19:59.360
He's a little tired. The CT
showed the hematoma's getting worse,

19:59.398 --> 20:02.595
so Dr. Bailey and I will be
taking him down to the OR soon.

20:04.570 --> 20:07.038
But he wrote you this letter.

20:07.072 --> 20:09.802
I'm not interested.

20:09.841 --> 20:11.536
"Sarabeth."

20:11.577 --> 20:14.603
Sorry. That wasn't me,
that was the letter.

20:15.881 --> 20:19.112
"I know you hate me."
Again, not me. The letter.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.277
I'm just gonna read.

20:20.319 --> 20:22.446
Um... "I know you hate me right now.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.751
And you have every right to.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.520
I betrayed you.
I betrayed our marriage.

20:27.559 --> 20:32.656
But I had lost my job and I couldn't
tell you, so I told Anna instead,

20:32.698 --> 20:35.360
which was wrong and stupid.

20:35.400 --> 20:40.064
I've wanted to tell you a million times.
And let you know how truly sorry I am.

20:40.105 --> 20:44.439
But now I have no voice,
so I'm begging you, please,

20:44.476 --> 20:49.436
if you could just listen with
your heart... " That is so poetic.

20:49.481 --> 20:51.608
That was me, sorry, not him... Sorry.

20:51.650 --> 20:54.676
"If you could just
listen with your heart

20:54.720 --> 20:58.656
when I tell you that I know
you can't forgive me right now,

20:58.690 --> 21:02.091
but I'm gonna do everything
in my power to make it up to you.

21:02.127 --> 21:06.257
But no matter what happens,
no matter what you decide to do...

21:07.065 --> 21:10.262
...I'm going to love you
until the end of time."

21:15.641 --> 21:19.475
That's it. I'm done talking.
Well, he's done. He's done. The End.

21:38.163 --> 21:39.187
Betty?

21:39.231 --> 21:41.665
She's not awake,
but I can take you to see her.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.396
- And her memory?
- We don't know yet.

21:50.309 --> 21:54.541
Oh, no. Oh, please don't say it.

21:54.579 --> 21:57.480
- I'm sorry, Vincent...
- Oh, God.

22:00.686 --> 22:04.213
- Oh, God, no.
- Very sorry.

22:04.256 --> 22:07.020
- Sarabeth...
- Don't, don't, don't. Just... don't.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.425
Sarabeth...

22:12.264 --> 22:16.132
Vincent's dead and Betty...

22:16.168 --> 22:18.830
We don't know if she's gonna be OK,

22:18.870 --> 22:24.001
- and Phil and Michael.
- Don't you mention his name to me.

22:24.042 --> 22:26.306
Sarabeth.

22:26.345 --> 22:29.075
More bad things have
happened to us today

22:29.114 --> 22:31.082
than have ever happened before.

22:31.116 --> 22:34.449
We've been blessed. Until today.

22:34.486 --> 22:38.684
I took it for it granted.
I took you for granted.

22:38.724 --> 22:42.216
We've been friends for 50 years.

22:42.260 --> 22:44.626
Ever since we were little girls.

22:44.663 --> 22:48.997
And I made one awful, awful mistake.

22:50.502 --> 22:55.030
- But I need my best friend.
- You slept with my husband...

22:55.073 --> 22:59.874
- Please...
- I'm going to go see Betty.

23:02.247 --> 23:04.238
I'm gonna see my friend.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.053
Sorry about teasing Alex.

23:17.095 --> 23:19.086
I forgive you.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.204
Tell me about trauma surgery.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.729
Trauma? Quick and dirty.

23:28.774 --> 23:32.972
No time to make things pretty,
and no time for mistakes.

23:33.011 --> 23:36.276
Drop your pants.
You need a shot of cefazolin I-M.

23:37.549 --> 23:39.210
No time for mistakes, huh?

23:39.251 --> 23:41.651
So, what, you don't make mistakes?

23:41.686 --> 23:43.620
I make mistakes, people die.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.163
I'm the best surgical resident
in my program, and...

23:55.033 --> 23:57.763
Today I killed a man
because I couldn't do a stitch.

23:59.805 --> 24:02.899
In the field, you do what you can.
Work with what you have.

24:02.941 --> 24:06.843
It's about somethings, not being
the best. It's about saving lives.

24:11.416 --> 24:14.613
I make mistakes.
Guys die by my hand, good guys.

24:15.554 --> 24:18.455
Guys who are fighting
for their country in a desert.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.822
And I don't know everything.
Nobody does.

24:20.859 --> 24:23.919
So I make mistakes. And I learn.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.624
And the next time
I don't make that mistake again,

24:26.665 --> 24:28.724
so the next guy, that guy? He lives.

24:33.371 --> 24:35.236
Mistakes are how you learn.

24:45.050 --> 24:49.316
Hi, Betty.
How are you feeling?

24:50.622 --> 24:52.214
My head...

24:53.758 --> 24:55.055
...hurts.

24:58.363 --> 25:00.388
What's going on?

25:00.432 --> 25:03.367
Betty, you and Vincent
were in a car accident.

25:03.401 --> 25:08.964
Vincent... I'm so sorry.
He didn't make it.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.475
No, no, please. No.

25:11.510 --> 25:15.173
No... He's in the other car,
he's gonna be here any minute.

25:31.630 --> 25:34.929
Oh, my head...

25:37.536 --> 25:39.231
It hurts.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.239
What happened?

25:48.547 --> 25:52.108
Well, you look pretty stable,
which is good because I can't let you

25:52.150 --> 25:55.950
go into your next surgery until
you're feeling strong and stable, OK?

25:58.924 --> 26:01.825
It happens, people make mistakes.

26:01.860 --> 26:05.193
They sleep with the wrong person
and they hide it,

26:05.230 --> 26:09.223
but if you ask me it's the part
that comes after that matters,

26:09.267 --> 26:11.292
the part where you make it right.

26:11.336 --> 26:13.964
I think you're off to a good start.

26:20.111 --> 26:23.046
Karev. Michael Briar
ready for his ex-lap?

26:23.081 --> 26:27.677
- He was ready an hour ago.
- And I'm ready now. Book the OR.

26:29.454 --> 26:31.012
Fine.

26:33.758 --> 26:37.319
- Dr. Karev, what time is it?
- It's tomorrow.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.954
His insurance expired.

26:52.243 --> 26:55.144
- I'm sorry about the hand.
- These things happen.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.114
Not to me they don't.

26:57.148 --> 26:59.981
Or they didn't before
you existed for me.

27:00.018 --> 27:03.010
Before you existed, I was good.

27:04.055 --> 27:06.046
Every doctor wanted me in their OR.

27:06.091 --> 27:08.787
I was known as a damn good scrub nurse.

27:08.827 --> 27:11.990
And now I'm the crazy girl
out of <i>Fatal Attraction</i>

27:12.030 --> 27:14.464
who goes around stabbing surgeons.

27:14.499 --> 27:16.262
Sorry.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.701
I'm so... I'm sorry.

27:20.372 --> 27:24.468
There's an opening in peds.
I start on their service tomorrow.

27:25.644 --> 27:29.239
Again. Very sorry about your hand.

27:48.066 --> 27:49.158
What's...

27:51.236 --> 27:52.533
What am I doing here?

27:53.271 --> 27:57.537
Where's Vincent?
Did something happen?

27:58.710 --> 28:01.042
I can't... I can't tell her anymore.

28:01.079 --> 28:02.876
- I won't.
- I know.

28:04.249 --> 28:06.308
Why don't you two take a break.

28:06.351 --> 28:10.344
- Check on things.
- I don't want her to be alone.

28:10.388 --> 28:12.948
I'll sit with her, I don't mind.

28:20.899 --> 28:22.867
Sarabeth, Anna.

28:22.901 --> 28:25.392
Am I in a hospital?

28:25.437 --> 28:30.534
Oh, honey...
There's been an accident.

28:30.575 --> 28:32.475
Where's Vincent? Is he OK?

28:37.782 --> 28:40.546
Your husband is on his way,
he'll be here any minute.

28:40.585 --> 28:42.212
- He's on his way now?
- Yes.

28:42.253 --> 28:44.949
- Oh.
- He's just around the corner.

28:44.989 --> 28:48.083
If you watch the door,
you'll see him any minute.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.822
- You'll see him.
- Oh, good, he's...

28:50.862 --> 28:53.160
- He's on his way?
- He's on his way.

28:53.198 --> 28:56.895
- Around the corner?
- Yes. Around the corner.

29:06.311 --> 29:08.336
It's better for her.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.049
Thank you.

29:17.355 --> 29:19.721
Come on, let's go check on our husbands.

29:33.571 --> 29:36.165
Karev, I think that clock is wrong.

29:36.207 --> 29:39.472
I know it says 2:30am,

29:39.511 --> 29:43.914
but I'm pretty sure
it's actually only 11:58pm.

29:43.948 --> 29:46.178
- Can you fix it, please?
- Set it back?

29:46.217 --> 29:47.684
Set it back.

29:47.719 --> 29:52.850
It's important that the official
hospital record shows the right time.

29:52.891 --> 29:55.724
And the insurance company needs it too.

29:55.760 --> 29:59.628
And I say it's only 11:58pm.

30:11.309 --> 30:12.503
Scalpel.

30:24.022 --> 30:26.616
You know, you'd be good in the field.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.388
Now you've got this battle scar,
you'd fit right in.

30:29.427 --> 30:31.088
- Right.
- I'm serious.

30:31.129 --> 30:34.997
You should ditch this place,
go for the adventure.

30:36.067 --> 30:38.661
You telling me this place
gives you a rush, a high?

30:40.972 --> 30:44.032
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

30:44.075 --> 30:45.906
Dr. Hunt, there you are.

30:46.778 --> 30:48.541
How's the gash on that leg?

30:48.580 --> 30:51.606
Uh, Dr. Yang took good care of me.
Excellent care of me.

30:51.649 --> 30:56.177
I made a few calls. They speak very
highly of you at Maryland Shock Trauma.

30:56.221 --> 30:59.520
I also heard a story that
you constructed an OR table

30:59.557 --> 31:02.720
from a exploded humvee in
the middle of the desert. True?

31:02.760 --> 31:05.320
Had to be innovative
in the middle of the desert.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.331
Have to be innovative everywhere.

31:07.365 --> 31:10.061
How would you like a job, Dr. Hunt?

31:14.472 --> 31:18.909
Uh, appreciate the offer,
but I'm due to go back to the sandpit.

31:18.943 --> 31:20.467
Finish my tour.

31:22.046 --> 31:24.844
Well, good luck to you.

31:37.495 --> 31:38.519
What?

31:52.410 --> 31:54.935
I... I don't even know you.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.712
So?

32:27.111 --> 32:29.875
It might've been
the hypothermia treatment.

32:29.914 --> 32:32.508
- Or my surgical skills.
- We'll never know.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.147
What's going on?

32:36.187 --> 32:38.985
Phillip can wiggle his toes.

32:39.023 --> 32:41.548
Say it.

32:41.592 --> 32:44.186
- Don't make me say it.
- Please? Say it. Say it for me.

32:44.228 --> 32:47.129
Even though it's
technically not true yet.

32:50.201 --> 32:51.964
We made a man walk.

32:52.003 --> 32:54.836
- We made a man walk.
- We made a man walk!

33:24.969 --> 33:27.028
What a nice way to wake up.

33:30.775 --> 33:32.902
Did you sleep with Meredith?

33:35.580 --> 33:36.911
Yeah, I did.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.472
Why?

33:38.516 --> 33:42.316
I... I mean... Sorry.

33:43.054 --> 33:44.487
Were you in love with her?

33:44.522 --> 33:46.513
Thought I was.

33:48.126 --> 33:50.720
But I was too scared to admit it.

33:50.762 --> 33:54.960
I did know that she
did not like me that way,

33:54.999 --> 33:58.298
and I did it anyway.

33:58.336 --> 34:00.201
And I shouldn't have because...

34:00.238 --> 34:02.069
I'm...

34:02.106 --> 34:07.908
Besides just being so selfish, I...

34:07.945 --> 34:12.473
You know, take advantage of her that
way, to want her to want me like that

34:12.516 --> 34:14.542
when clearly she...

34:16.853 --> 34:19.254
Like I said,
I made mistakes the last year,

34:19.290 --> 34:21.315
but I'm trying to get back on track.

34:22.193 --> 34:25.321
- I gotta do that by myself.
- The only reason I...

34:25.362 --> 34:27.991
...I wanted to help...

34:28.733 --> 34:34.569
...is because I feel like you and I
are more than just roommates.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.665
We are more than just roommates.

34:38.376 --> 34:39.934
We are?

34:40.777 --> 34:45.147
Yeah, we're friends. I mean, right now,
you're probably one of my best friends.

34:45.183 --> 34:47.947
Best friend.

35:41.606 --> 35:43.597
I'm not an experimenter.

35:43.641 --> 35:46.201
I don't like to experiment.

35:46.244 --> 35:50.772
But then you showed up,
and we did it together,

35:50.815 --> 35:53.181
and the experiment
was kind of a success.

35:53.217 --> 35:54.343
Oh.

35:56.921 --> 35:59.321
Oh!

36:02.093 --> 36:04.118
Look, I've never done this before.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.562
I... I've never kissed a girl.

36:06.597 --> 36:09.464
I'm not sure I even like kissing girls.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.560
I don't, actually, like kissing girls.

36:12.603 --> 36:14.002
I just...

36:14.038 --> 36:16.529
...like kissing one girl.

36:17.441 --> 36:18.635
You.

36:20.578 --> 36:23.206
I don't have anything
to compare it with.

36:23.247 --> 36:27.013
I... You're the only woman
I've ever kissed.

36:27.051 --> 36:31.317
- So you're freaking out too?
- A lot of therapy time.

36:31.355 --> 36:34.085
I don't do therapy.
I just get all... Ah!

36:34.125 --> 36:35.820
And then I get all clingy, and...

36:35.860 --> 36:38.488
OK, you don't need to know that yet.

36:40.398 --> 36:41.524
So...

36:41.566 --> 36:45.935
Does this... This kind of
makes us virgins, doesn't it?

36:45.970 --> 36:49.030
I guess, in a way, it does.

36:49.073 --> 36:51.541
Virgins.

36:51.576 --> 36:53.840
Hey, we can be scared together.

36:53.878 --> 36:58.474
Kind of virgins, and, yeah,
we can be scared together.

37:02.653 --> 37:04.314
- OK?
- Yeah. Thanks.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.752
You said Derek and I
would never make it.

37:08.793 --> 37:11.819
And then I was
karmically impaled for saying it.

37:11.862 --> 37:12.920
But you're right.

37:12.964 --> 37:17.025
People don't have happily ever afters,
people barely have ever afters.

37:18.269 --> 37:21.295
So why would Derek and I
be any different?

37:23.341 --> 37:26.242
Mer. Why do you care what I think?

37:26.277 --> 37:28.472
Because you're my person.

37:29.780 --> 37:32.977
And if I'm going to do this with him,
be whole and healthy.

37:33.017 --> 37:36.282
Be a warm, gooey person
who lives with a boy...

37:36.320 --> 37:38.982
I need you. I need you on board.

37:39.023 --> 37:40.615
I need you to cheer me on.

37:40.658 --> 37:44.492
Because you're the only one
who knows me...

37:44.528 --> 37:46.393
...darkly.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.793
Really knows me.

37:48.833 --> 37:53.133
I need you to pretend that I can
do this, even if you don't believe.

37:53.170 --> 37:56.765
Because if you abandon me now
I will never make it.

37:56.807 --> 37:58.775
I'll never get my happy ending,

37:58.809 --> 38:01.004
- and that's just...
- Life.

38:01.045 --> 38:03.479
I'm saying please here.

38:08.486 --> 38:11.853
I think you and Derek will make it.

38:11.889 --> 38:13.618
You'll make it work.

38:13.658 --> 38:16.092
Are you just telling me
what I want to hear?

38:21.198 --> 38:23.223
I am your person.

38:23.267 --> 38:25.633
I'm on your side.

38:28.205 --> 38:32.073
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>happily ever after.</i>

38:32.109 --> 38:34.873
<i>The stories we tell</i>
<i>are the stuff of dreams.</i>

38:54.498 --> 38:57.058
<i>Fairy tales don't come true.</i>

39:02.106 --> 39:06.008
See? I told you
I would show you my dress.

39:07.378 --> 39:09.573
You look better than a bride.

39:52.590 --> 39:54.956
<i>Reality is much stormier.</i>

40:05.102 --> 40:06.592
<i>Much murkier.</i>

40:13.944 --> 40:15.969
<i>Much scarier.</i>

40:27.858 --> 40:29.917
Listen up, people!

40:31.362 --> 40:33.387
Listen up.

40:43.908 --> 40:47.207
We used to be the best
surgical program in the West.

40:48.412 --> 40:51.381
An upstart program
that no one ever heard of

40:51.415 --> 40:53.940
that blew everyone out the water.

40:54.852 --> 40:58.151
And then, overnight, we got old,

40:58.189 --> 41:01.852
entrenched and sloppy,
just like everyone else.

41:02.693 --> 41:05.321
We've been resting on our laurels.

41:05.362 --> 41:08.331
You have all been failing.

41:08.365 --> 41:11.960
Failing to take initiative,
failing to ask the tough questions.

41:12.002 --> 41:13.765
Failing to practice your skills.

41:13.804 --> 41:17.103
Failing to give opportunity
to practice skills.

41:19.543 --> 41:21.170
And I let it happen.

41:21.212 --> 41:24.613
So you have not failed, we have failed.

41:25.382 --> 41:28.112
Well, it stops. And it stops now.

41:28.652 --> 41:32.679
People sliding over general surgery
as though they'll never see anything,

41:32.723 --> 41:35.851
but a heart or a brain
through the course of their career.

41:35.893 --> 41:39.920
As though blood from the heart doesn't
make its way through the whole body.

41:39.964 --> 41:42.762
Or the nerves
don't travel past the brain stem.

41:44.001 --> 41:47.596
It's shoddy teaching,
and it makes for shoddy surgeons.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.602
We've failed.

41:51.609 --> 41:56.512
Get it? We all have. And it stops now.

42:00.117 --> 42:04.281
The surgical training protocol
is officially changing, people.

42:05.322 --> 42:07.017
The bar has been raised.

42:09.426 --> 42:11.724
Consider yourself on notice.

42:13.197 --> 42:15.757
<i>Reality.</i>
<i>It's so much more interesting</i>

42:15.799 --> 42:17.767
<i>than living happily ever after.</i>
