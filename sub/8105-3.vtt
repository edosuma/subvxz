WEBVTT

00:08.258 --> 00:09.550
Good morning.

00:19.687 --> 00:20.895
Hey, Alfredo.

00:22.898 --> 00:26.025
- You done already?
- No. Not yet. I finish tomorrow.

00:26.151 --> 00:29.320
- Mexico playing Argentina on TV?
- No, no.

00:30.614 --> 00:32.490
My asthma is very bad today.

00:32.616 --> 00:35.451
Six years, Alfredo.
You can't lie to me.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.370
- I'm throwing a dinner...
- First thing tomorrow...

00:37.496 --> 00:38.788
Party's tonight.

00:38.914 --> 00:41.916
A little rain and I'm gonna
have to put buckets
on the dining room table.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.961
- No clouds, no rain.
- I'll tell you what.

00:45.087 --> 00:48.423
You take off, but if it pours
into my guests' wineglasses...

00:49.133 --> 00:52.885
- Okay. Okay, seÃ±ora. I'll do it.
- Thank you.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.433
Spinal cord seems intact.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.060
Take a deep breath.

01:43.187 --> 01:44.687
- It hurts.
- Try.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.107
Breath sounds bilateral.
I don't think
he has a pneumothorax.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.359
- Just asthma.
- That and probably a broken rib.

01:50.486 --> 01:51.861
Tell me when it hurts
the most.

01:54.990 --> 01:57.158
Your two little fingers
are darker than the others.

01:57.284 --> 02:00.870
They feel funny. Como needles.

02:00.996 --> 02:04.207
- How long have they been like that?
- Never noticed before.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.374
Is bad?

02:40.202 --> 02:42.411
Judging by how it looks,
he could lose his hand.

02:42.538 --> 02:45.873
How does falling off your roof
do that to a guy's fingers?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.334
He could have tweaked
a vertebra in his neck.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.253
Could impinge the ulnar...

02:51.421 --> 02:53.422
Sorry, trouble concentrating.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.883
That tank top
really absorbs moisture.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.846
Could impinge the ulnar nerve,
cut the blood flow.

02:59.972 --> 03:03.140
Or it could be disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy.

03:03.267 --> 03:04.559
DIC?

03:04.685 --> 03:06.686
Guy falls off a roof,
the first thought is always,

03:06.812 --> 03:07.812
"It's a clotting problem".

03:07.938 --> 03:10.439
Trauma can activate
the clotting enzymes.

03:10.566 --> 03:13.401
- Guy could lose more than his hand.
- Thank you very much.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.486
This guy's been working for me
for a long time, and I...

03:15.612 --> 03:18.281
Do I get bonus points
if I act like I care?

03:19.867 --> 03:23.828
Cervical MRI.
Work up for DIC. And start him
on a heparin drip.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.413
- Who?
- You wanna know his name?

03:25.539 --> 03:28.082
I'm sure it's in the file.
Or you could ask her.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.043
She's his oldest, bestest friend.
They were in Cub Scouts together.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.795
I'll get started
on the blood tests.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.839
You haven't been
a real doctor in 10 years.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.424
You'll make a mess all over the sheets.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.426
- I'll do it.
- You have clinic duty.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.137
- I still know how to handle a patient.
- Get me blood.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.930
Lots of blood.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.974
They're better.
They've showered.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.576
You don't need to see him.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.746
One-handed handymen
aren't in big demand.

04:06.872 --> 04:09.582
Talking. That's how
lawsuits are lost.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.791
I know you, Lisa.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.836
You go in, you offer
to pay his medical bills, his wages,

04:13.962 --> 04:15.630
you'll say something stupid
like, "I'm sorry".

04:15.756 --> 04:16.881
You think I'm an idiot.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.717
I think you're not a lawyer.
Don't go in there.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.638
Trust me, House's people
can handle this.

04:25.724 --> 04:26.891
Yeah.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.269
This might
sting a little bit.

04:30.896 --> 04:34.023
The medicine will thin the blood
and help it to circulate.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.067
Those are pretty
nasty scars there.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.527
I work construction.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.909
How long
will I be in the hospital?

04:45.035 --> 04:47.411
Depends how long it takes us
to figure out what's going on.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.372
I need to work.
I'll get fired.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.040
I'm sure Dr. Cuddy
won't fire you.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.751
I'm a janitor at fast food six nights.
I need to work.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.295
- My mother doesn't make enough.
- I can work. I'm old enough.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.005
You're old enough
when you finish college.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.131
Why? You never went...

04:59.257 --> 05:01.050
I never had a big brother
to tell me to shut up!

05:01.176 --> 05:04.428
I promise we'll let you
out of here as soon as
we're able to.

05:04.554 --> 05:08.432
Look, I... I am fine. Okay?
I feel better. I go home now.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.560
No.
If this is a clotting problem,
it could be very serious.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.437
- All right?
- Look, you can't make me stay.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.898
- Wait...
- You can't make me stay.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.566
Turn your hand over.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.902
I need to see your hand.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.118
Where's Dr. Cuddy?

05:27.369 --> 05:29.036
We've got a third finger
turning dark.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.248
His PTT is prolonged and the fibrin
split products are off.

05:32.374 --> 05:35.251
He's not clotting properly.
It looks like a mild case of DIC.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.919
Well, obviously
not that mild.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.463
This keeps up,
his hand is literally gonna
be dead meat.

05:39.589 --> 05:42.717
His hand
is connected to his arm,
and his arm is connected to...

05:42.843 --> 05:44.260
I'm not sure,
but I bet it's important.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.554
All this from falling off
my roof!

05:46.680 --> 05:49.473
Yeah. If only he'd fallen
on his head.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.268
Then he wouldn't have any
of these symptoms.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.563
We need something
stronger than heparin.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.191
Human Activated Protein C.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.569
Looks like Cuddy,
same cleavage.

06:02.237 --> 06:05.281
Protein C is indicated
only for severe sepsis.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.867
How many of his limbs
have to be at stake
for it to be severe?

06:07.993 --> 06:10.619
But this stuff
is crazy dangerous.

06:10.746 --> 06:12.204
It can cause
internal bleeding.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.581
If he bleeds, he could stroke,
he could die.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.874
He could get better.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.959
You know, if I try
to scheme like this,

06:17.085 --> 06:20.254
you get that nasty
wrinkly face and screech
like a hyena.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.089
It's very sexy, I admit.

06:23.842 --> 06:24.842
Do it.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.932
Protein C
is borderline irresponsible,

06:32.059 --> 06:34.101
except that the safe stuff
isn't doing squat.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.396
- It's exactly what you would do.
- Obviously.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.317
- It's exactly what he'd do.
- I know.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.486
I think he's trying
to protect me.

06:43.612 --> 06:46.072
Now, that's not
the type of thing he would do.

06:46.198 --> 06:47.281
I overruled him.

06:47.407 --> 06:51.410
He's the best diagnostician
in this hospital,
and I overrule him.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.913
You care about this kid.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.290
Your judgment
should be worth more than his.

06:56.416 --> 07:00.169
He also pointed out
that I haven't been
a real doctor in years.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.213
Now that sounds like him.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.006
You were
just jerking Cuddy around?

07:04.132 --> 07:06.592
She seriously thought
I wanted to stop her.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.261
- One thing Cuddy is not is clueless.
- No.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.306
First casualty of this case
is her sense of humor.

07:12.432 --> 07:16.102
That's weird.
There's nothing funnier than
almost killing a guy.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.315
I'm just having trouble
getting up those steps.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.276
- When did you start noticing?
- Oh, a week ago.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.278
Your blood pressure's
a little high.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.280
I've got something new
that should help you out.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.741
It combines a nitrate
with a blood pressure pill.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.285
It's targeted
to African-Americans.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.662
Targeted?

07:34.788 --> 07:37.498
Yeah. Well, see,
we tend to have
nitric oxide deficiencies.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.667
And the studies show
this drug counteracts
that problem.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.626
It's the first drug to...

07:40.752 --> 07:42.878
What kind of studies you talking about?

07:43.004 --> 07:44.588
What kind of studies
are there?

07:44.714 --> 07:47.508
They get some patients.
They give them some drugs.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.387
I've had white people
lying to me for 60 years.

07:52.389 --> 07:55.891
- You think this is a tan?
- You think they tell you everything?

07:57.102 --> 07:58.269
The trouble
with us black folk,

07:58.395 --> 08:01.105
we can't tell
the difference anymore
between racism

08:01.231 --> 08:03.357
- and everybody gets screwed.
- Yeah?

08:03.483 --> 08:07.319
Well, how about them
cheap meningitis drugs
they're pawning off in Africa?

08:07.445 --> 08:10.698
- Gonna tell me that ain't racism?
- That's just greed.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.285
You really wanna screw whitey?

08:14.411 --> 08:18.706
Be one of the few black men
who live long enough
to collect social security.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.332
Take the medicine.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.265
Nurse.

08:36.391 --> 08:39.560
Nurse! Help! Nurse! Help!

08:40.395 --> 08:41.478
- Nurse!
- What's up?

08:41.605 --> 08:45.441
- I can't move my arm!
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

08:48.862 --> 08:52.948
The Protein C side effects
we were worried about,
they happened.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.867
- Where was the bleed?
- His brain.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.452
It's causing
right side paralysis.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.622
I've stopped the treatment
and called a neurosurgeon.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.579
I can move it now.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.540
- It's okay now? Can I go home soon?
- The surgery went well.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.752
But all we did
was fix the problem created
by the medicine we gave you.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.424
She says you...
You look young.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.093
Are you sure...

09:54.219 --> 09:56.553
There's five of us working on the case.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.639
The others are older.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.808
Why doesn't Dr. Cuddy
come to...

10:05.939 --> 10:07.731
That doesn't sound too good.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.328
His fingers are even darker.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.247
His temperature's 102
and spiking.

10:23.373 --> 10:27.042
And the x-ray
now shows lung infiltrates.

10:27.168 --> 10:30.921
Well, the good news is he
won't be bitching about losing
his hand if he can't breathe.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.300
The trauma from the fall
could have caused acute
respiratory distress syndrome.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.260
Right. I forgot. Your roof.

10:36.386 --> 10:39.179
It would cause
lung infiltrates
and maybe fever

10:39.306 --> 10:41.181
and conceivably
the cyanotic fingers.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.476
- The only question is why.
- Why what?

10:44.769 --> 10:46.603
Why her weird psychopathology

10:46.730 --> 10:50.774
requires a diagnosis
informed entirely
by personal guilt.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.235
Let's assume
we've been wrong up until now.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.070
Let's assume,
just for one second,

10:55.196 --> 10:58.032
that the earth doesn't revolve
around Cuddy's roof.

10:58.825 --> 11:02.161
What if he was sick
before he had his run-in
with gravity?

11:02.287 --> 11:03.370
He just didn't
notice anything.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.373
Well, pneumonia
can cause DIC which can cause
cyanotic fingers.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.542
- Pneumonia doesn't hit that fast.
- Sure.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.129
Only pavement hits that fast.
It's not pneumonia.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.548
He might have missed
a finger turning dark.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.133
He's not gonna miss
breathing problems.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.010
- What else?
- It's pneumonia.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.264
He wanted to go home.
I thought he was lying.

11:22.390 --> 11:25.476
I told him
I had a dinner party.
I made him go up there.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.354
Well, why didn't you
just take out a gun
and shoot him?

11:28.480 --> 11:30.147
I thought it was just asthma.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.358
You might've mentioned this
earlier, Doctor.

11:32.484 --> 11:35.069
Maybe we could have sent
some blood cultures to the lab

11:35.195 --> 11:37.696
instead of wasting a day
indulging your self-loathing.

11:37.822 --> 11:42.117
If it's just garden-variety
bacterial pneumonia,
he's gonna be fine.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.621
So give him garden-variety
Levaquin, and a garden-variety
echocardiogram.

11:45.747 --> 11:46.955
And go check out
the kid's house.

11:47.082 --> 11:49.333
The blood work
will show us which type
of pneumonia it is...

11:49.459 --> 11:52.961
If he's huffing nail polish
or pulling the wings
off his pet parrot,

11:53.088 --> 11:54.380
this way'll be faster.

11:54.506 --> 11:57.674
And I bet
Julio's just dying to find out
what's wrong with him.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.177
- Go with her.
- It's Alfredo.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.846
And I can handle
getting a key and...

12:02.972 --> 12:06.892
Rico and I no longer trust you
deciding what's important
and what's not.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.152
You ever think
about writing a book
on office politics?

12:17.278 --> 12:18.487
Trust me,

12:18.613 --> 12:21.907
it would be a lot worse
if I told her that you had
to break into her house.

12:22.909 --> 12:26.120
What? Wait, wait, wait...
Cuddy's house?

12:26.246 --> 12:27.830
See? It is shocking.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.333
The guy's
been working there every day
for the last three weeks.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.335
You think
it's impossible he could've
picked something up?

12:33.461 --> 12:36.630
- I'm not breaking into my boss's house.
- I'm your boss.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.507
She's scarier than you are.

12:39.134 --> 12:42.469
She's a woman.
Relax. I'm coming with.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.978
House is having lunch
with his juniors now?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.730
- No. Not a chance.
- Then where do you think they're going?

12:53.857 --> 12:56.150
I have no idea.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.693
Then why don't you think
they're going to lunch?

12:57.819 --> 12:59.903
Because it's not like House.
That was your point, right?

13:00.029 --> 13:01.321
He had that smug look
on his face.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.656
When he's that pleased
about something

13:02.782 --> 13:05.242
he's gotta tell somebody,
and the only somebody
he knows is you.

13:06.870 --> 13:10.456
- He's breaking into Cuddy's home.
- What?

13:10.582 --> 13:11.623
Why?

13:12.542 --> 13:14.251
Medical reasons?

13:14.377 --> 13:15.836
Why is he so curious
about Cuddy?

13:15.962 --> 13:17.337
Why are you so curious
about his curiosity?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.672
Why are you so curious
about me...

13:18.798 --> 13:21.341
Because you dumped him
and you're married

13:21.468 --> 13:25.012
and they are neither
of those things.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.472
I'm just curious.

13:27.390 --> 13:30.476
- Nothing wrong with that.
- No. Nothing wrong with that.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.648
What do you think? Red thongs?

13:38.067 --> 13:39.776
I think red thongs.

13:41.196 --> 13:44.948
Okay, 20 bucks says
I can get through this door
in 20 seconds.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.700
- You're on.
- Count me in.

14:03.384 --> 14:07.429
No furniture polish,
no paint thinner, nor
anything else worth sniffing.

14:07.555 --> 14:11.391
Nothing in here, either,
except a few cockroaches.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.146
Nice. Someone
should fix Alfredo's roof.

14:18.358 --> 14:21.652
So, why haven't you
fired House?

14:23.613 --> 14:26.949
It's just, you guys are always
screaming at each other,

14:27.075 --> 14:29.743
- and I figure you hate him, so...
- I don't hate him.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.121
Why not?

14:35.250 --> 14:37.167
He's a great doctor,

14:37.293 --> 14:40.170
but any other
hospital administrator would
have fired him years ago.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.922
Four of them did.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.258
The question is,
why did I hire him?

14:45.468 --> 14:47.302
So, how'd you know
about her key?

14:47.428 --> 14:50.514
You been doing
a little handyman work
for Cuddy yourself?

14:50.640 --> 14:54.434
Someone as obsessive
and insecure as Cuddy
probably has three extra keys

14:54.561 --> 14:56.228
hidden away
within 10 feet of the door.

14:56.354 --> 14:59.481
And you consider obsession
a negative quality.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.027
Insecticide is organic.
Soap is hypoallergenic.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.780
I got the bedroom.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.496
This is where it all happens.

15:20.503 --> 15:23.380
You both went to Michigan.
Did you know him
while you were there?

15:23.506 --> 15:26.300
I was still an undergrad,
but, yeah, I knew him.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.010
He was already a legend.

15:29.137 --> 15:32.723
- So you just knew him as a legend?
- My God, you're subtle.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.474
Anything on your mind?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.606
- More cockroaches?
- Worse.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.152
Beautiful.

15:46.821 --> 15:49.740
There's no way
you just deduced
where that key was.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.491
Does this count as red?

15:53.661 --> 15:56.371
You gave yourself 20 seconds
and put money on it.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.497
Oh, my God.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.460
She's got pictures
of you in here.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.463
Just you. It's like some kind
of weird shrine.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.340
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

16:13.514 --> 16:16.516
She uses super tampons.
What does that mean?

16:16.643 --> 16:20.646
You two are just
too nasty to each other
not to have been nasty.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.774
I can be a jerk to people
I haven't slept with.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.275
I am that good.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.527
There's nothing here.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.364
You ready to go,
or you got some more stuff
you wanna sniff?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.199
Whoa! Check this out.

16:33.576 --> 16:38.330
It's fuzzy. It's black.
It's alive.

16:54.514 --> 16:58.058
Patient's lung function's
declining rapidly.
Levaquin's not working.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.310
He obviously doesn't have
garden-variety pneumonia.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.896
I'm glad you learned
to take his impending death
in stride.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.023
- Guess what he does have.
- Rats.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.568
- Scars on his hand.
- Rat bites.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.529
But he says
they're from construction work

17:10.655 --> 17:13.740
so he won't have to admit
he's got rats at home.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.492
Catholics are right.
Pride will kill you.

17:15.618 --> 17:16.743
He has streptobacillus.

17:16.869 --> 17:17.953
Rat-bite fever.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.372
- Boogie oogie oogie.
- Fits the symptoms perfectly.

17:20.498 --> 17:22.374
That's certainly
one possibility.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.585
But what about
the aspergillus fungus
we found under the sink?

17:25.712 --> 17:29.214
- What sink?
- You should clean your bathroom better.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.383
You broke into my house?

17:31.509 --> 17:34.886
No. No. You're wrong.
I had a key.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.888
You had no right
to invade my privacy.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.015
There was no medical reason
for that whatsoever,

17:39.142 --> 17:41.101
and there was certainly
no moral reason for it.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.061
Oh, damn.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.397
You're right.

17:45.523 --> 17:48.150
The focal consolidation
makes fungal pneumonia
far more likely.

17:48.276 --> 17:49.484
You're right I'm right.

17:49.610 --> 17:53.363
On the bright side, it has
the advantage of keeping you
totally responsible.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.365
The treatment for aspergillus
is amphotericin.

17:55.491 --> 17:58.535
- That's hugely dangerous.
- Yeah? Your point being?

17:58.661 --> 18:01.371
Going the dangerous
and aggressive route
didn't work the last time.

18:01.497 --> 18:04.875
It's bound
to work this time. Start him
on the amphoterrible.

18:26.731 --> 18:27.856
Dr. Cuddy?

18:29.233 --> 18:31.401
I'm Manny, Alfredo's brother.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.195
How's he doing?

18:33.321 --> 18:36.114
He's worried about money.
I wanna work for you.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.826
How old are you, Manny?

18:40.495 --> 18:42.162
- Fifteen.
- Twelve?

18:43.372 --> 18:46.708
I can paint.
I mow lawns. I rake leaves.
I can start today.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.419
Alfredo wants you
to finish school.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.879
Like you care.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.715
Manny, I've known
your brother...

18:53.841 --> 18:57.135
He falls off your roof,
and you don't come
see him once?

18:59.806 --> 19:00.806
Bitch.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.523
With a patient.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.192
Not according to the log.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.528
- It's 3:15.
- Is it a commercial?

19:16.405 --> 19:17.656
How's Cuddy doing?

19:19.492 --> 19:21.827
She's not acting like Cuddy.
It's a pleasure.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.370
You know her.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.665
She has trouble
with these situations,
feels personally responsible.

19:26.791 --> 19:29.376
The technical term
is narcissism.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.086
You can't believe
that everything is your fault

19:31.212 --> 19:33.588
unless you also believe
you're all-powerful.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.465
Wow, does she sound messed up.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.343
I don't believe
I can fix everything.

19:38.469 --> 19:40.804
And I don't
lie awake at night,
tormented by that fact.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.639
No. You lie awake
tormented by how...

19:42.765 --> 19:44.766
I thought we were talking
about Cuddy here.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.059
She cares.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.187
She enjoys feeling guilty.

19:49.313 --> 19:53.066
Lisa cares. It's why
she drives you nuts. 'Cause
it's not just a puzzle to her.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.401
The patients
are actually real,

19:54.527 --> 19:56.236
their feelings
actually relevant.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.406
And I'm telling her
she can't even talk to him.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.617
My God, it's contagious.
You're feeling guilty, too.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.704
I'm just saying,
take it easy on her.
You owe her that.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.831
From the moment
I saw you at the EI...

20:08.499 --> 20:11.459
- Commercial's over.
- So glad we talked.

20:12.503 --> 20:14.462
Snap, crackle, pop.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.008
You got some
Rice Krispies in there?

20:18.801 --> 20:20.385
That bad, huh?

20:20.511 --> 20:22.387
You were here yesterday.

20:22.513 --> 20:26.808
I see from the chart
that Dr. Foreman prescribed
medicine, not a miracle.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.268
Got to give this stuff
more than a day.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.604
I didn't fill
that Oreo's prescription.

20:31.814 --> 20:34.983
On the theory
that you didn't trust him
because he's black.

20:35.109 --> 20:38.904
Well, I'm gonna prescribe
the same medicine and see
if you fill it this time.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.406
I'm not buying
into no racist drug, okay?

20:42.700 --> 20:46.244
It's racist because
it helps black people
more than white people?

20:46.370 --> 20:49.623
On behalf of my peeps,
let me just say thanks
for dying on principle for us.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.375
Look, my heart's red.
Your heart's red.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.669
And it don't make no sense
to give us different drugs.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.339
You know,
I have found a difference.

20:57.465 --> 20:58.673
Admittedly,
it's a limited sample,

20:58.799 --> 21:01.551
but based on my experience
of the last 90 seconds,

21:01.677 --> 21:04.137
all black people are morons.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.307
- Sorry, African-Americans.
- I'll see another doctor.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.310
Fine. Fine.

21:14.649 --> 21:17.525
I'll give you
the same medicine
we give Republicans.

21:22.073 --> 21:24.115
I think the medicine
is working.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.410
They're lighter, right?

21:27.536 --> 21:30.330
They don't look
lighter to me, Alfredo.
How's the tingling?

21:30.456 --> 21:33.083
- Does not bother me.
- Tell her the other thing.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.254
He hasn't peed
since yesterday.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.675
- Since last night?
- Afternoon.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.511
It's not a problem.
I don't drink much.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.849
I think
we'll give you a little rest
from the meds here.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.939
She says, "That's the medicine
that's supposed to cure me".

21:56.065 --> 21:58.525
Just making
a little adjustment.
Excuse me.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.862
He's not making any urine.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.824
I think we just destroyed
the kid's kidney
with the amphotericin.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.701
I think he's dying.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.411
Dying?

22:09.537 --> 22:11.121
Cheese it, the cops.

22:17.712 --> 22:20.296
I guess she understands
a little English.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.594
His kidneys are shutting down

22:26.721 --> 22:29.723
due to the direct toxicity
to the proximal
tubule epithelium.

22:29.849 --> 22:33.101
Proof that my brilliant idea
of giving him amphotericin
is killing him.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.020
That wasn't a complete
waste of time.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.981
His reaction shows
that you don't need to clean
under your sink.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.065
It wasn't aspergillus.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.651
And blood cultures
show he was negative
for rat-bite fever.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.154
There's still plenty of other
cool pneumonias.

22:44.280 --> 22:47.574
Tested negative for Moraxella,
Nocardia, cryptococcus.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.326
He has a low titer
for chlamydia antibodies.
Maybe...

22:50.453 --> 22:53.038
No, no.
His chest x-ray's all wrong
for chlamydial pneumonia.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.164
But the titer points to...

22:54.290 --> 22:56.750
- He had an STD last year.
- That explains the titer.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.626
He has low sodium.
Maybe it's Legionella.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.879
No. His antigen is negative.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.089
Well, that all sucks.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.384
Maybe we were right
to begin with.

23:06.510 --> 23:10.972
His problems are all caused
by DIC precipitated
by falling off my roof.

23:11.098 --> 23:13.349
DIC wouldn't cause
a fever this high.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.769
See? My lap dog
agrees with me.

23:15.895 --> 23:16.895
How high?

23:17.021 --> 23:19.439
Two hours ago
it was 103 with acetaminophen.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.691
What about on St. Alban's Day?

23:21.817 --> 23:25.820
Only temperature
I'm interested in right now
is his temperature right now.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.119
Open up.

23:35.164 --> 23:38.041
Okay. Let me clarify.
Open up and keep it open.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.757
- Yeah.
- Okay.

23:48.469 --> 23:49.969
Under your tongue.

23:54.308 --> 23:56.351
You're using your left hand.

23:56.477 --> 23:59.187
- Right one hurt?
- No, I feel better.

23:59.313 --> 24:00.396
What, it really doesn't hurt,

24:00.523 --> 24:01.689
or you just figure
if you say no,

24:01.816 --> 24:03.024
you'll get out
of the hospital sooner?

24:03.150 --> 24:05.193
It doesn't hurt. I feel good.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.074
You don't smell too hot.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.416
Your hand is starting to rot.

24:21.544 --> 24:22.585
Why are we here?

24:22.711 --> 24:24.337
We are talking about
cutting off a kid's hand.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.047
Yes, we're talking
about cutting it off,

24:26.173 --> 24:28.049
not subdividing it
and putting in condos.

24:28.175 --> 24:31.344
- It's not a legal issue.
- Are you being intentionally dense?

24:32.638 --> 24:33.805
I think it's premature.

24:33.931 --> 24:35.265
- I've heard enough.
- What?

24:35.391 --> 24:37.267
She says one word
and you take her side.

24:37.393 --> 24:40.061
You should at least wait
until she actually gives
a medical reason.

24:40.187 --> 24:43.064
- Otherwise I might take it personally.
- Shut up.

24:43.190 --> 24:46.442
If I were to somehow
find out that you two
were in disagreement

24:46.569 --> 24:48.236
over the proper
medical course of action,

24:48.362 --> 24:50.488
it could make it awkward
for my client in court.

24:50.614 --> 24:54.409
My client being
the two of you. So, guys,
I'm a little busy here.

24:54.535 --> 24:58.538
Why don't we
pick this conversation up
in half an hour? Okay?

24:58.664 --> 25:01.124
All of his symptoms are caused
by his underlying problem

25:01.250 --> 25:02.625
and the medicine we gave him.

25:02.751 --> 25:03.751
What underlying problem?

25:03.878 --> 25:05.587
You have no idea
what the underlying
problem is.

25:05.713 --> 25:08.006
- You're the diagnostician.
- Fine. It's all my fault.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.215
Does that make you
feel better?

25:09.341 --> 25:10.967
His hand still has
an arterial pulse.

25:11.093 --> 25:13.887
His hand is a cesspool.
And the crap is spreading.

25:14.013 --> 25:17.473
You are being
pretty aggressive about
destroying a man's livelihood.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.184
I don't give a damn
about his livelihood.

25:19.310 --> 25:22.645
He loses that hand,
he loses his job,
all of his jobs.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.315
- He's not like us...
- Can't work as a cripple?

25:28.819 --> 25:29.861
He loses his home.

25:29.987 --> 25:33.156
- His kid brother drops out.
- An American dream destroyed.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.657
Very sad, very emotional,

25:34.783 --> 25:37.410
not one medical fact
in the whole pathetic tale.

25:38.704 --> 25:39.829
You have lost perspective,
Cuddy.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.623
You've stopped looking
at this as a doctor.

25:41.749 --> 25:44.584
You're acting like someone
who shoved somebody
off their roof.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.962
You wanna make things right?
Too bad, nothing's ever right.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.175
I am happy to report
that we're now so in sync

25:52.301 --> 25:54.552
we're actually wearing
each other's underwear.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.137
Chop-chop time.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.973
- Is this true?
- No. I'm lying.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.684
It's stupid to do it with her
in the room, I guess.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.770
- This is a big decision.
- We made it.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.772
We should convene a meeting
of the ethics committee.

26:05.898 --> 26:06.981
No!

26:08.150 --> 26:11.653
Look, she is making
a medical decision based on
never wanting to feel regret.

26:11.779 --> 26:14.280
You're making a legal decision
based on wanting me
to be wrong.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.865
Greg, you have
a history of aggressive...

26:15.991 --> 26:17.408
You wanted
superficial agreement.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.410
You wanted
everybody's asses covered.
You got it.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.330
Now can I do the surgery?
Pretty, pretty please.

26:26.835 --> 26:27.835
Lisa,

26:29.463 --> 26:31.673
are you sure
you're okay with this?

26:34.510 --> 26:36.970
I should be the one
to tell the family.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.561
Your hand is dying.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.065
The bacteria are eating it.

26:50.484 --> 26:53.987
When
they run out of food there,
they go somewhere else.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.866
If you cut off my hand,
I'll be cured?

26:58.993 --> 27:00.743
Unfortunately, no.

27:00.869 --> 27:04.789
We still have to find
the disease that's making you
sick to begin with.

27:04.915 --> 27:07.834
But you won't die of gangrene
while we're looking.

27:14.258 --> 27:18.094
I quit school
when I am 12 to get a job,

27:18.220 --> 27:19.971
to help my family.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.933
I know I never get a good job,

27:24.977 --> 27:28.980
never save money
or own my own house like you.

27:31.108 --> 27:34.110
But, Manny, he's smart.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.780
He's the best in his class.

27:39.700 --> 27:42.994
Well, maybe Manny
doesn't have to quit school.
Maybe you can...

27:52.963 --> 27:55.965
Are you sure
I need to do this?

27:58.677 --> 27:59.761
Yes.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.640
Okay.

28:05.809 --> 28:06.809
Okay.

29:10.207 --> 29:13.042
I gave
one of my clinic patients
a follow-up call.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.919
Your name came up.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.880
I'm guessing an old black guy

29:18.006 --> 29:21.676
who thinks the CIA invented
rap music to make your people
want to kill each other.

29:21.802 --> 29:24.220
He said you gave him
the white folks' stuff.

29:24.972 --> 29:27.014
This is exactly
why black people
don't live as long...

29:27.141 --> 29:30.810
This isn't about race,
unless annoying is a race.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.396
- Is he not getting better?
- He's fine so far.

29:34.481 --> 29:37.525
I'm calling him back in.
I'm getting him
on the right stuff.

29:37.651 --> 29:39.986
Relax, Foreman, he already is.

29:41.989 --> 29:45.408
I told him
it was the white stuff.
I gave him the black stuff.

29:48.996 --> 29:50.079
He was right.

29:51.081 --> 29:52.748
You did exactly
what white people do.

29:52.875 --> 29:55.960
You figure we don't need
to know the truth
or can't understand it,

29:56.086 --> 29:58.296
so you just lie to us.

29:58.422 --> 30:01.007
- Just a white lie.
- Good one, massa.

30:02.009 --> 30:03.509
Right, and I'm a racist.

30:05.012 --> 30:08.973
Too bad that idiot
will never know for the rest
of his long, long life.

30:15.981 --> 30:20.526
Every slave master
thought they were doing
the black man a favor.

30:21.320 --> 30:25.114
Negro can't
take care of himself,
so we'll put him to work.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.950
We'll give him four walls,
a bed.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.370
We'll civilize the heathen.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.998
I'll tell you what.
Stop doing us favors.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.293
If you're right, and we end up
back in the jungle

30:37.419 --> 30:39.629
with lousy
blood pressure medicine,

30:40.297 --> 30:42.006
it won't be on your head.

31:35.352 --> 31:36.352
You okay?

31:39.940 --> 31:42.233
You wondering
if you made the right call?

31:44.194 --> 31:46.988
I've wanted to be a doctor
from the time I was 12.

31:48.991 --> 31:50.866
I wanted to be a lawyer
from the time I was six

31:50.993 --> 31:52.952
until my second week
of law school.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.704
Sorry. Your story.

31:56.999 --> 32:01.085
I graduated medical school
at 25, pissed off that I was
second in my class.

32:02.004 --> 32:06.632
Chief of medicine at 32,
second youngest ever,
first woman...

32:06.758 --> 32:07.758
Sad story.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.885
If I had been
Alfredo's doctor...

32:10.012 --> 32:11.512
You are his doctor.

32:13.140 --> 32:16.809
I insisted
on giving him Protein C.
We had to cut his skull open.

32:16.935 --> 32:20.187
I insisted on amphotericin,
killed his kidneys.

32:20.314 --> 32:22.481
I missed the pneumonia
completely.

32:23.358 --> 32:26.694
I would have searched his home
and ignored mine.

32:26.820 --> 32:30.781
I would have watched him die
trying to save his hand.

32:32.743 --> 32:35.911
If I didn't have House
looking over my shoulder...

32:36.038 --> 32:38.497
Are you saying
you're not as good a doctor
as House is?

32:38.624 --> 32:40.249
I'm saying House is right.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.003
I was so anxious to get ahead.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.923
I haven't been a doctor
in years.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.093
His little finger is dusky.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.179
Yeah, that's why
we're doing this.

32:53.305 --> 32:57.016
No. I mean the other hand,
the one we haven't
chopped off yet.

33:23.794 --> 33:25.795
His O2 sats are down to 88.

33:25.921 --> 33:28.631
His lungs are giving out.
He needs a ventilator.

33:29.466 --> 33:30.508
And dialysis.

33:30.634 --> 33:34.220
You're getting distracted
by the multisystem
organ failure.

33:34.346 --> 33:37.056
Pinkies are supposed
to be pink, right?

33:37.182 --> 33:38.849
I mean,
they're not called "gray-ies".

33:38.975 --> 33:40.768
But the organ failure
is gonna kill him.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.645
But the pinky is weirder.

33:43.397 --> 33:44.522
What does it tell us?

33:44.648 --> 33:46.732
The same thing the right hand
told us before we cut it off.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.652
- It's the same symptom.
- But at a different time.

33:50.654 --> 33:53.239
His blood work
indicates mild DIC.

33:53.907 --> 33:56.867
What if it's mild in the way
that when you get out
of the ocean,

33:56.993 --> 33:59.537
the water clinging
to your body makes
the sea level drop?

33:59.663 --> 34:01.539
It's technically true,
but it's completely
irrelevant.

34:01.665 --> 34:04.083
A lack of DIC
would explain everything

34:04.209 --> 34:06.961
if there were also
a lack of anything to explain.

34:09.339 --> 34:12.299
Endocarditis.
His heart's infected.

34:13.218 --> 34:16.721
Little bacteria cauliflowers,
clinging to his valves.

34:16.847 --> 34:20.224
Except sometimes
they can't hold on. They go
swimming in his bloodstream.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.935
Thursday, one breaks off,
goes to his right hand,

34:23.061 --> 34:24.520
black fingers, gangrene.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.856
Friday's child
heads for the kidneys.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.151
And we all know
what Saturdays are all about.

34:30.277 --> 34:32.278
Party with the left hand.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.612
Also explains the fever.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.698
It's perfect
except for the little fact

34:35.824 --> 34:37.491
that we already tested
for endocarditis,

34:37.617 --> 34:38.534
and he was negative.

34:38.660 --> 34:41.287
Which means he either
is negative or...

34:41.413 --> 34:45.207
What infection can cause
pneumonia and culture-negative
endocarditis?

34:47.544 --> 34:49.670
Prize value goes down
with every clue.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.259
You're thinking psittacosis?

34:55.385 --> 34:57.052
Alfredo doesn't have
any pet parrots.

34:57.179 --> 34:59.513
Quit your squawking.
Give him doxycycline.

34:59.639 --> 35:01.974
No! That'll just make
his clotting problem worse.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.519
I liked you better
when you were coming up with
wacky drugs for us to try.

35:05.645 --> 35:09.064
We give him the doxy now,
damn it, maybe we can
save his pinky.

35:09.191 --> 35:11.066
He can teach his brother
to count all the way to five.

35:11.193 --> 35:14.111
If you're wrong,
he'll end up with no hands
and no feet.

35:14.237 --> 35:17.031
Technically, if I'm wrong,
he'll end up dead,
but I take your point.

35:17.157 --> 35:19.575
- What's his night job?
- He cleans up at some fast food joint.

35:19.701 --> 35:21.535
What, you think he got it
from a chicken nugget?

35:21.661 --> 35:25.539
Since when do fast food joints
allow 12-year-olds
to mop floors?

35:25.665 --> 35:28.751
- Alfredo is 20.
- Really? Looks younger.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.381
Where were you going
to work tonight?

35:34.508 --> 35:36.634
What job do you do
on Saturday nights?

35:39.346 --> 35:40.846
- What are you doing?
- Wake him up.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.515
We just cut off his hand.

35:42.641 --> 35:45.643
- Yeah. We need to talk about it.
- It's not happening.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.818
Honest, I've got no idea
what I just said.

35:53.944 --> 35:56.153
Why didn't you say
you spoke Spanish?

35:56.279 --> 35:58.489
Well, because
she'd wanna talk to me.

35:58.615 --> 36:00.533
Or something like that.

36:05.789 --> 36:07.540
She says he doesn't work
Saturday nights.

36:07.666 --> 36:08.833
Give me the talking juice.

36:08.959 --> 36:11.085
The fact
it doesn't fit your theory
doesn't make it a lie.

36:11.211 --> 36:12.169
When she was out of the room,

36:12.295 --> 36:16.215
the kid brother insisted
he was gonna cover for Alfredo
at work tonight.

36:23.598 --> 36:26.058
Saturday nights
he goes dancing.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.727
Either it's a lie
or he's dancing with birds.

36:30.647 --> 36:31.605
Give her the talking juice.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.524
She doesn't know
what you're talking about.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.067
Odds are it's gonna be
close to his house.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.528
It's probably an abandoned
warehouse or factory.

36:37.654 --> 36:39.822
Take the Scooby gang
and spread out.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.448
What the hell
are we looking for?

36:41.575 --> 36:43.242
Find somebody
who looks like crap.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.494
Tell him you want
to place a bet.

37:40.175 --> 37:41.342
It's Cuddy.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.971
I already put him
on the psittacosis meds.

37:46.973 --> 37:49.016
As soon as you left.

37:49.142 --> 37:50.517
You're welcome.

37:51.853 --> 37:54.980
What do you think the record
for one-handed juggling is?

37:55.899 --> 37:57.650
You can yo-yo one-handed.

37:58.652 --> 37:59.693
Good point.

38:08.411 --> 38:09.954
I always wash my hands.

38:10.956 --> 38:15.084
If a bird is infected,
you can get psittacosis
just from breathing his dust.

38:15.919 --> 38:18.545
But then, why do I get sick
and nobody else?

38:18.672 --> 38:20.673
Your asthma
made you vulnerable.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.679
- You're gonna be all right now.
- Yes.

38:38.108 --> 38:39.608
For saving my life.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.828
He thanked me.

38:50.954 --> 38:53.497
- He should have.
- We cut off his hand.

38:56.501 --> 38:57.584
If we'd figured it out
earlier...

38:57.711 --> 38:59.586
If you'd figured it out later,
he'd be dead.

38:59.713 --> 39:01.880
I never figured it out at all.

39:02.966 --> 39:05.592
- Hello.
- What do you want, House?

39:06.302 --> 39:10.431
If you're wallowing
in self-loathing, I've got
something that might help.

39:10.557 --> 39:11.890
We're getting sued.

39:12.559 --> 39:15.561
- You saved his life. He admitted that.
- We'll settle.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.605
He's got a stub where his hand
used to be. We have insurance.

39:18.732 --> 39:20.566
Case seems pretty solid to me.

39:21.526 --> 39:24.194
The new American dream.
Happy ending.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.155
Kid's gonna be just fine.

39:32.287 --> 39:33.370
Cuddy,

39:35.498 --> 39:36.665
your guilt.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.627
It's perverse and it makes you
a crappy doctor.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.467
It also makes you
okay at what you do.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.846
You figure
a perverted sense of guilt
makes me a good boss.

39:50.972 --> 39:54.767
Now, would the world
be a better place if people
never felt guilty?

39:54.893 --> 39:56.769
Makes sex better.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.980
You should have
seen her in the last months
of our relationship.

40:00.106 --> 40:02.274
A lot of guilt.
A lot of screaming.

40:04.694 --> 40:07.863
I know this wasn't just
because it was your roof.

40:11.284 --> 40:12.367
Cuddy,

40:14.996 --> 40:19.083
you see the world as it is,
and you see the world
as it could be.

40:19.209 --> 40:21.835
And what you don't see
is what everybody else sees,

40:22.921 --> 40:25.422
the giant gaping chasm
in between.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.508
House, I'm not naive.
I realize...

40:27.634 --> 40:30.177
If you did,
you never would have hired me.

40:33.807 --> 40:37.392
You're not happy
unless things are just right,

40:37.519 --> 40:39.061
which means two things.

40:39.854 --> 40:43.690
That you're a good boss,
and you'll never be happy.

40:48.696 --> 40:52.366
By the way,
why does everybody think
you and I had sex?

40:53.118 --> 40:55.452
You think there could be
something to it?

41:05.672 --> 41:09.341
Cuddy feels guilty
about not diagnosing
psittacosis any earlier?

41:12.011 --> 41:13.262
I think so.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.557
There's no way
she could have.

41:17.225 --> 41:18.350
No.

41:20.353 --> 41:21.854
No way she could have.

41:33.116 --> 41:34.408
It's raining.
