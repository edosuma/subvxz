00:35.513 --> 00:40.257
[dark dramatic music]

03:23.768 --> 03:26.728
Time has come, my friends
[ominous music]

03:26.858 --> 03:29.905
For a long time we have
struggled, haven't we?

03:31.559 --> 03:35.040
Starving for what is to come.

03:37.521 --> 03:42.657
For tonight we quench our
thirst for the manifestation

03:42.787 --> 03:44.485
of our beliefs.

03:46.356 --> 03:49.098
A perfect subject approaches.

03:53.189 --> 03:55.539
A perfect subject approaches.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.891
A perfect vessel.

04:05.114 --> 04:06.246
Throw him in.

04:06.376 --> 04:07.856
Steve didn't dig a hole
to hell for nothing,

04:07.986 --> 04:09.031
put him in there.

04:14.428 --> 04:16.343
[light reflective music]

04:16.473 --> 04:17.735
Lorna.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.086
I really miss you.

04:24.307 --> 04:26.831
I'll try and get ya a
fresh one every day.

04:33.708 --> 04:34.970
[muffled groaning]

04:35.100 --> 04:37.015
[ominous music]

04:37.146 --> 04:39.453
Who the hell is on my property?

04:42.107 --> 04:43.370
Hello!?

04:50.246 --> 04:52.596
[man groaning]

04:52.727 --> 04:54.163
[ominous music]

04:54.294 --> 04:57.862

[dramatic music]

05:47.259 --> 05:50.001
[monster grumbling]

06:02.144 --> 06:11.196
We have brought you forth in
good faith and great effort.

06:11.327 --> 06:19.640
You must feed and transform
further and become stronger.

06:19.770 --> 06:23.992
My loyal subjects are
but your servants

06:24.122 --> 06:27.909
and are here to help you
with that task.

06:28.039 --> 06:31.042
Be free, but not just yet.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.830
Be free and let chaos reign.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.222
All right, cool.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.401
[ground thudding]

06:41.531 --> 06:45.013
Now, see that the beast is fed.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.538
[ominous music]

06:48.669 --> 06:49.757
No.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.541
Now, now, now, now.

06:52.847 --> 06:53.630
[gasping]

06:54.805 --> 06:56.938
Holy shit.

06:58.287 --> 07:02.160
Lorna, we got a big problem.

07:08.602 --> 07:12.432
[ominous music]
[birds chirping]

07:27.969 --> 07:30.232
[bell dings]

07:32.103 --> 07:33.453
Morning, Timmy.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.983
[saw buzzing]

07:46.204 --> 07:47.989
[man grunts]

07:48.119 --> 07:49.686
Damn it, Timmy, what?

07:51.601 --> 07:52.602
Damn kid.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.432
Poncho!
[suspenseful music]

07:56.563 --> 07:57.389
[whistles]

07:57.520 --> 07:58.303
Hey, Poncho!

08:00.392 --> 08:01.263
Come here, boy.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.615
Where the hell did
you run off to?

08:05.746 --> 08:07.835
Poncho, come here, boy.

08:07.965 --> 08:08.836
Hey!

08:08.966 --> 08:12.013
[suspenseful music]

08:42.130 --> 08:44.654
[ominous music]

09:05.457 --> 09:08.156
[glovebox clicks]

09:21.909 --> 09:23.867
[dramatic music]
Hey, Sheriff!

09:24.912 --> 09:25.782
Rick.

09:29.612 --> 09:32.093
[light music]
[Sheriff sighs]

09:34.704 --> 09:36.924
Getting all settled in, are ya?

09:37.054 --> 09:39.709
As much as one can, I guess.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.233
Not much to get settled
into now, is there?

09:42.364 --> 09:43.800
Yeah, I know.

09:43.931 --> 09:47.412
She ain't much to look at,
but we have a close knit

09:47.543 --> 09:49.980
community here, it's been
that way for 50 years.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.504
That's what they told me.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.204
I get it.

09:56.334 --> 09:59.642
You big town folk aren't too
keen on small town living.

09:59.773 --> 10:03.211
We don't got your supermarkets
or your Radioshacks.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.389
I like the quiet,
actually, Rick.

10:07.519 --> 10:10.087
Oh, well that's good 'cause
we got plenty of that.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.046
Chiggers and snakes, too.

10:16.833 --> 10:17.704
Rick.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.142
I'll leave ya to it.

10:24.536 --> 10:25.581
See ya.

10:28.236 --> 10:29.106
[Liz] Ooh, that's nice.

10:29.237 --> 10:30.194
- Look good?
- Yeah.

10:30.325 --> 10:31.369
- Come on, coffee.
- Where?

10:31.500 --> 10:32.632
- Right here.
- All right, get ready.

10:32.762 --> 10:33.371
Yeah.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.416
All right.

10:34.546 --> 10:35.678
- See if it works?
- Mm hmm.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.115
- Oh!
- That's a real good one,

10:38.246 --> 10:39.639
- that was real close.
- I know, pretty close.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.166
Morning, everyone.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.472
- Morning.
- Morning, Sheriff.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.910
[Sheriff] Anything
new to report?

10:50.040 --> 10:52.129
Yeah, um.

10:52.260 --> 10:55.655
Oh, somebody stole
Frosty from the Teegan's

10:55.785 --> 10:56.960
front yard yesterday.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.092
Really?

10:58.222 --> 11:00.007
I swear, who steals a
plastic snowman?

11:05.142 --> 11:06.013
That's it?

11:08.406 --> 11:11.671
Uh, there might be a rabid
coon up in Fox Tail Canyon.

11:11.801 --> 11:12.584
Again?

11:12.715 --> 11:13.673
Yeah.

11:13.803 --> 11:14.674
[scoffs]

11:14.804 --> 11:15.805
Raccoons, what do you...

11:15.936 --> 11:17.024
I don't know how to deal
with raccoons.

11:17.154 --> 11:18.721
How do you guys normally
deal with raccoons?

11:18.852 --> 11:20.201
We have to shoot 'em.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.159
Especially if it's rabid, yeah.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.466
I guess that makes sense.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.687
Not many raccoons in New York,
boss?

11:27.817 --> 11:30.602
Lots, just never had to
deal with any rabid ones.

11:30.733 --> 11:31.995
Is that a normal
thing around here?

11:32.126 --> 11:33.040
[Liz] What?

11:33.170 --> 11:34.432
Rabid animals.

11:34.563 --> 11:35.433
Sometimes.

11:35.564 --> 11:36.652
Yeah, especially the cows.

11:36.783 --> 11:37.871
Ooh.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.786
Cows.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.266
Oh yeah, a lot of
vampires swooping around.

11:45.356 --> 11:47.358
Vampires.

11:47.489 --> 11:49.099
What the hell are we
talking about here?

11:49.230 --> 11:50.100
Bats.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.232
Bats?

11:51.362 --> 11:52.537
Yeah, rodents who fly.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.583
Yeah, they carry rabies, boss.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.977
Bite the cow's legs and transfer
it over to the damn things.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.718
- It gets real bad.
- It gets weird.

12:00.197 --> 12:00.981
Like that movie.

12:02.983 --> 12:03.853
What movie?

12:05.028 --> 12:06.769
The movie.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.250
The one with the mother and
the son, they're in the car,

12:09.380 --> 12:11.426
the rabid dog just...

12:15.473 --> 12:16.692
The mother, the son,
they're in the car

12:16.823 --> 12:18.302
with the dog with
rabies and trapped.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.653
Really?

12:22.959 --> 12:23.786
No one here?

12:24.961 --> 12:26.180
No, I can't say

12:26.310 --> 12:28.878
I've ever seen a movie
like that, Sheriff.

12:29.009 --> 12:29.923
Yeah. Have you?

12:30.053 --> 12:31.707
- Uh, no.
- No.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.318
Are you a big fan of movies,
boss?

12:34.449 --> 12:35.929
Yeah, I guess you
could say that.

12:41.195 --> 12:44.372
All right, well, I'm gonna
go make the rounds, so...

12:45.547 --> 12:47.244
You hold down the fort?

12:47.375 --> 12:48.158
See you later.

12:49.725 --> 12:52.336
[Teddy whistles]

12:56.384 --> 12:57.254
He's got a crush.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.216
[chuckles]

13:03.695 --> 13:05.088
[sighs]

13:10.006 --> 13:12.443
[upbeat music]

14:31.609 --> 14:32.480
Oh.

14:35.483 --> 14:36.919
Hi, Teddy.

14:37.050 --> 14:37.877
Morning.

14:39.966 --> 14:43.099
Um, can I get you a
cup of coffee?

14:44.971 --> 14:45.885
That'd be wonderful.

14:48.713 --> 14:51.020
[Deanna] So, how's
the new sheriff?

14:51.151 --> 14:54.632
Oh, he's quiet.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.199
That makes sense.

14:56.330 --> 14:57.157
Does it?

14:57.287 --> 14:58.332
Sure.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.899
He doesn't really know
any of us here.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.814
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.425
Sure is.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.079
He moved all the way
out here from

15:06.209 --> 15:08.298
a place half a world away.

15:08.429 --> 15:12.650
Big city, all the lights,
all the people.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.827
I wonder what that must be like.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.265
What's that?

15:18.395 --> 15:20.223
That I wonder how
that must feel.

15:20.354 --> 15:21.442
Probably pretty lonely.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.358
Oh.

15:24.488 --> 15:25.881
I guess I hadn't
thought about it.

15:27.317 --> 15:28.710
Don't give him too much grief.

15:29.972 --> 15:30.799
Who, me?

15:31.843 --> 15:32.888
I wouldn't dream of it.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.023
Hey, Deanna.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.024
Mornin', Harry.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.503
Ah, Teddy.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.811
How you doing?

15:42.942 --> 15:46.206
How's our little fledgling
town doing this morning?

15:46.336 --> 15:49.209
Oh, well, the day's
just started, sir, so...

15:49.339 --> 15:51.951
Yeah, I suppose it is,
I suppose that is true,

15:52.081 --> 15:53.517
I suppose so.

15:53.648 --> 15:54.562
Uh, Teddy.

15:56.216 --> 15:58.000
Let me ask you something.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.828
He's a nice fella, Harry.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.962
He hasn't really begun making
his rounds around here yet,

16:03.092 --> 16:07.531
so a whole lotta people
think that he's a bit cold.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.969
Lonely maybe.

16:16.453 --> 16:19.935
Yeah, I guess it takes time
adjusting to a quiet place.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.372
Uh, Teddy, um...

16:24.940 --> 16:26.811
How's your mama doing?

16:26.942 --> 16:28.770
Is she liking it down in Dallas?

16:30.902 --> 16:32.730
She is.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.036
She does, likes it just fine.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.517
It's a change of
scenery for her,

16:36.647 --> 16:38.736
so it oughta do her some good.

16:41.435 --> 16:45.265
[sighs]

16:45.395 --> 16:46.788
There are some things about
home she misses, though.

16:51.575 --> 16:54.535
Yeah, make sure to
give her my best.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.931
All right, well, I
better be off.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.284
Thank you for the coffee,
Deanna.

17:04.414 --> 17:05.936
Harry.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.069
Teddy.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.684
[chuckles]

17:16.122 --> 17:18.037
What you waiting for, huh?

17:18.166 --> 17:19.212
That's a good kid.

17:19.342 --> 17:20.387
What's wrong with you?

17:23.912 --> 17:25.914
Let me have a glass of eggnog.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.959
Fine.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.526
[Harry] This kid doesn't
know what he started.

17:29.657 --> 17:30.832
[Deanna] Only one, though.

17:30.962 --> 17:32.747
Only one.

17:32.877 --> 17:33.574
There's nothing in it, right?

17:33.704 --> 17:35.097
[both laughing]

17:39.710 --> 17:41.060
Ooh, look at you lookin' busy.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.889
You doing all right?

17:45.020 --> 17:46.891
[Teddy] Yeah, I'll live.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.154
Streets are clean.

17:48.284 --> 17:49.198
All right.

17:57.859 --> 18:02.733
[dramatic music]

18:05.693 --> 18:07.477
Mornin', Bill.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.523
Anything I can do for you
and the 12 gauge

18:09.653 --> 18:11.046
you just slammed on my desk?

18:11.177 --> 18:13.222
I wanna make a complaint.

18:13.353 --> 18:15.398
Okay, about what exactly?

18:15.529 --> 18:17.922
On my property last
night something happened.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.360
I had a group of visitors.

18:20.490 --> 18:21.404
Trespassers?

18:21.535 --> 18:22.492
Visitors.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.366
What... I don't understand.

18:26.496 --> 18:27.715
Visitors, what do you call 'em?

18:27.845 --> 18:28.977
Trespassers.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.067
Oh, okay, well that
must be a big city word.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.112
I don't get it.

18:33.242 --> 18:34.852
Actually, it's just English,
Bill.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.027
Do you know who these
individuals are?

18:36.158 --> 18:37.072
No, sir.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.379
Did they take anything?

18:39.509 --> 18:41.076
Did they destroy anything?

18:41.207 --> 18:42.121
[suspenseful music]

18:42.251 --> 18:43.818
Well, they were
dressed in sheets.

18:45.907 --> 18:51.260
All kind of like, I don't
know, Purdue University

18:51.391 --> 18:54.481
sheet-looking things, you
know, with that color.

18:54.611 --> 18:56.744
They had that horrible
Purdue color, you know?

18:56.874 --> 18:58.528
The team never makes
the final four,

18:58.659 --> 19:01.227
but when they do, they wear
that awful, I don't know,

19:01.357 --> 19:03.142
yellowish kinda thing
that they have.

19:03.272 --> 19:04.926
Sheets that color.

19:05.056 --> 19:07.668
Faces covered, scarves
over their nose,

19:07.798 --> 19:09.496
and act like like they
were in Afghanistan

19:09.626 --> 19:10.671
or some fucking place.

19:11.846 --> 19:13.935
They started dancing around.

19:14.065 --> 19:16.285
Moving, swaying, doing
all that stuff,

19:16.416 --> 19:17.982
and started with all
that hippie stuff

19:18.113 --> 19:20.289
only it wasn't Na Merengue.

19:20.420 --> 19:24.685
You know, the bald guys,
and with the orange on.

19:24.815 --> 19:28.036
And they all start holding
hands and made a ring.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.169
There was about a dozen of 'em.

19:30.299 --> 19:33.302
They were dancing around,
then they joined hands,

19:33.433 --> 19:35.435
then they danced
around in a circle

19:35.565 --> 19:38.220
like old hippie girls or like,
you know,

19:38.351 --> 19:40.396
the Hare Krishna people.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.355
And then they started chanting.

19:42.485 --> 19:46.533
It was in rhyme and they
were altogether on it.

19:46.663 --> 19:50.276
And then they started
chanting words

19:51.842 --> 19:55.455
in a gibberish kind
of a language.

19:55.585 --> 19:59.850
And then, all of a sudden,
they drag a guy out

19:59.981 --> 20:03.637
of the bushes over there and
he's laying down right here

20:03.767 --> 20:07.728
and next to him the
earth started to open up.

20:07.858 --> 20:11.122
The earth started to open up.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.734
And I'm way over there
watching and I look down

20:13.864 --> 20:17.607
and I can't see down in the
hole but it goes way down.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.566
And it's a door to hell.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.045
And out of that hole.

20:21.176 --> 20:22.786
Hey, bud, look at me.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.180
Out of that hole comes a thing.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.878
And as it gets higher and
higher out of the ground

20:28.009 --> 20:30.403
and I see the whole thing
it's the most terrifying

20:30.533 --> 20:32.796
horrible looking beast you've
ever seen in your life.

20:32.927 --> 20:35.016
A being.

20:35.146 --> 20:38.019
Some kind of, you know,
thing you couldn't imagine

20:38.149 --> 20:39.412
could ever be put together.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.327
Frightening, terrifying!

20:41.457 --> 20:42.893
And then you know what
the beast says?

20:43.024 --> 20:47.202
He goes into the body of
the guy on the ground.

20:48.812 --> 20:52.076
And he's gone,
but the body is there.

20:52.207 --> 20:56.429
And he's in the body,
so he now is in this body.

20:56.559 --> 20:59.301
This horrifying thing.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.825
Who is capable, I'm sure,
of anything.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.353
Anything else?

21:07.483 --> 21:08.484
I'm sorry?

21:08.615 --> 21:10.399
Is there anything else?

21:10.530 --> 21:13.837
Uh, yeah.

21:13.968 --> 21:16.666
I was in 'Nam and I saw
a lotta shit.

21:16.797 --> 21:18.015
You're from the big city.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.321
Mmhmm.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.323
You've seen a lotta shit.

21:21.454 --> 21:23.151
But neither one of us
ever saw shit

21:23.282 --> 21:26.067
as scary or frightening as this

21:26.197 --> 21:27.808
and you gotta do
something about it.

21:30.854 --> 21:32.856
All right, let me get
this straight.

21:37.861 --> 21:39.602
You got a whole buncha
people on your property-

21:39.733 --> 21:41.038
[Bill] Yeah.

21:41.169 --> 21:43.084
They're wearing Purdue uniforms?

21:43.214 --> 21:45.086
[Bill] Yeah.

21:45.216 --> 21:46.870
They're dancing
around and singing.

21:47.001 --> 21:48.219
- Right.
- And wearing

21:48.350 --> 21:49.438
- funky pants.
- Chanting, chanting.

21:49.569 --> 21:50.744
Chanting.

21:52.093 --> 21:53.747
A hole opens in the ground.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.662
- Yeah.
- Okay, so something-

21:55.792 --> 21:57.490
[Bill] And the hole was deep.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.056
- Okay, so deep hole.
- Yeah.

21:59.187 --> 22:00.188
Something comes
out of the hole--

22:00.319 --> 22:01.494
- Yeah.
- Goes into the body.

22:01.624 --> 22:02.973
- Yeah.
- Where does the body go?

22:03.104 --> 22:07.064
Got up and ran off that
way into the woods.

22:07.195 --> 22:08.283
- Of course it did.
- The other folks

22:08.414 --> 22:09.589
all just took off.

22:11.721 --> 22:12.896
Let me ask you a question.

22:15.203 --> 22:16.987
You know if kids like
to come on your property

22:17.118 --> 22:18.075
and they like to party,

22:18.206 --> 22:19.294
- any of that stuff?
- Speak up, asshole.

22:19.425 --> 22:20.295
What?

22:20.426 --> 22:21.688
I'm trying to help you

22:21.818 --> 22:23.646
- and you call me an asshole?
- Yeah, but I can't hear you.

22:23.777 --> 22:24.691
Okay, am I allowed to be deaf?

22:24.821 --> 22:26.345
Yeah, you're allowed to
do whatever you want.

22:26.475 --> 22:28.651
Okay. What's
the question?

22:28.782 --> 22:30.740
You got a lotta kids that
come on your property

22:30.871 --> 22:32.873
- and they like to party?
- Never, never.

22:33.003 --> 22:36.398
You've only been here a couple
weeks, you don't know me.

22:36.529 --> 22:39.227
They know who I am and they
don't come on my property.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.491
And after three minutes with
me now you also know who I am.

22:42.622 --> 22:46.103
I'm a raging asshole,
but I got game.

22:46.234 --> 22:47.844
- You got game?
- And I saw something

22:47.975 --> 22:50.369
- bigger than game last night.
- Okay.

22:54.155 --> 22:55.809
Are you a drinker?

22:55.939 --> 22:58.333
Does Pinocchio have a
wooden dick?

22:58.464 --> 23:00.291
Hey.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.903
Y'all seen Poncho?
I can't find him anywhere.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.252
- Again, Bernard?
- Jesus Christ.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.037
Can't you put a leash on
your fucking dog one time?

23:07.168 --> 23:08.778
He doesn't need a leash
in this town, Bill.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.606
Of course he needs a leash,
he's a dog!

23:10.737 --> 23:13.043
He's got a dog named Poncho.

23:13.174 --> 23:15.785
The dog is never on a leash!

23:15.916 --> 23:17.613
You know, there are
signs out there that say

23:17.744 --> 23:19.572
every dog should be on a leash.

23:19.702 --> 23:23.184
He's a dog, he's mangy,
he's a critter, he bites people,

23:23.314 --> 23:25.491
and the dog is a bit
of an asshole.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.580
- Plus he's a Mexican dog.
- What!

23:27.710 --> 23:29.886
- Okay-
- Never call my dog

23:30.017 --> 23:31.279
an asshole, old man.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.368
- If you ever call my dog-
- I said he was a Mexican dog.

23:33.499 --> 23:34.543
All right, come on,
come on, let's go.

23:34.674 --> 23:35.675
- Let's go.
- Are you saying Mexicans

23:35.805 --> 23:36.589
are assholes?

23:36.719 --> 23:37.633
Okay, all right, Bill.

23:37.764 --> 23:39.722
- Let's go.
- Thank you, Teddy.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.855
I just told you you were
worried about some fucking guy

23:41.985 --> 23:43.770
who can't keep his
dog on a leash?

23:43.900 --> 23:45.075
I'm listening to you.

23:45.206 --> 23:46.990
- I'll go check your property-
- Please.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.036
Don't call me an
asshole anymore.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.124
Uh, did I call
you an asshole?

23:50.254 --> 23:51.734
You did.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.780
[Bill] But I also tell you
before that I'm an asshole?

23:53.910 --> 23:56.391
- Okay.
- In 'Nam communication

23:56.522 --> 23:58.045
was the whole thing.

23:58.175 --> 24:01.701
So look for the phone lines
to go down at some point

24:01.831 --> 24:03.659
and then be talking on
short wave radios

24:03.790 --> 24:06.140
and you'll hear the
chatter back and forth

24:06.270 --> 24:07.924
and that's the first warning.

24:08.055 --> 24:09.230
That's when you know.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.840
[suspenseful music]

24:12.320 --> 24:13.364
Hello.

24:13.495 --> 24:16.106
Yeah? Um, Bill, give me
a few minutes.

24:16.237 --> 24:18.282
I'll go take a look at
your property, okay?

24:18.413 --> 24:20.241
You don't need to
worry about it,

24:20.371 --> 24:22.286
I already prepared for it.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.071
What's that supposed to mean?

24:24.201 --> 24:25.159
You'll see.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.205
I get shit done.

24:28.336 --> 24:31.078
This is bad shit, get it
taken care of.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.210
Because if you don't
take care of it,

24:33.341 --> 24:35.125
all hell's about to break loose.

24:35.256 --> 24:37.171
I'll take care of it.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.042
First thing on my list, Bill.

24:39.173 --> 24:40.043
Thanks for coming in.

24:46.441 --> 24:47.573
[dramatic music]

24:47.703 --> 24:50.401
Bill, your gun.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.057
He's very creepy.

24:54.188 --> 24:55.929
Is that normal?

24:56.059 --> 24:58.148
Um, he's been a
little off lately.

24:58.279 --> 24:59.976
I mean, he's been
seeing weird things,

25:00.107 --> 25:02.892
he once claimed to see
like an alien landing,

25:03.023 --> 25:06.113
but that was just a couple
kids screwing around, so...

25:13.076 --> 25:15.557
[ominous music]

25:27.787 --> 25:28.831
- Charlie.
- Good morning, Sheriff.

25:28.962 --> 25:29.876
[Woman] Morning, Sheriff.

25:30.006 --> 25:31.007
Where are you two headed off to?

25:31.138 --> 25:32.487
Uh, we're just gonna
go look at some eagles.

25:32.618 --> 25:33.923
Oh, be careful.

25:34.054 --> 25:34.881
[Charlie] Yes, sir.

25:37.144 --> 25:38.580
Oh, Timmy.

25:39.842 --> 25:41.148
Timmy, do me a favor.

25:41.278 --> 25:43.106
Stop delivering papers
on your bicycle.

25:43.237 --> 25:44.543
They're blowing all over town,
okay?

25:44.673 --> 25:45.979
- Okay, Sheriff.
- All right.

25:56.642 --> 25:59.819
Are you counting the days?
'Cause I am.

25:59.949 --> 26:02.691
It's less than a week
until jolly old Saint Nick

26:02.822 --> 26:06.390
comes to visit Hope Valley
for the 22nd annual

26:06.521 --> 26:10.177
Christmas Giving Celebration
and photos with Santa.

26:10.307 --> 26:14.137
So, bundle up the kids,
bring 'em on down,

26:14.268 --> 26:15.399
and have a good one.

26:17.619 --> 26:18.577
Thanks, sweetie.

26:20.361 --> 26:23.843
And now here's the latest
hit from The Midnight.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.453
[upbeat music]

26:25.584 --> 26:26.628
Uh, morning, Sheriff.

26:27.847 --> 26:28.761
Bobby.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.634
Um, I'm gonna go open up
the store, Mom.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.420
[Georgia] Okay.

26:36.551 --> 26:37.944
Did you get anything
new down there?

26:39.685 --> 26:42.557
"Elvira" and "Killer
Clowns from Outer Space".

26:44.124 --> 26:46.256
I was hoping for
"All the President's Men".

26:46.387 --> 26:47.475
Yeah, next time.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.042
- I'll see you later, sweetie.
- All right.

26:50.783 --> 26:51.610
Sheriff.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.917
What can I do for you, Joe?

26:55.048 --> 26:56.136
You have time for
some questions?

26:56.266 --> 26:58.573
Yep, I got about three minutes.

27:02.577 --> 27:04.623
Do you get many
listeners out here?

27:04.753 --> 27:07.408
Lots of farm folk from
miles around.

27:07.538 --> 27:08.757
They gotta have
something to listen to

27:08.888 --> 27:13.022
while they fix their trailers
and milk their damn cows.

27:13.153 --> 27:16.025
You get any chatter on the
other channels with this thing?

27:16.156 --> 27:18.898
Uh, I don't switch
channels too often.

27:19.028 --> 27:22.249
Too much religion and
not enough rock n' roll.

27:22.379 --> 27:24.947
But on occasion I do,
especially if there's

27:25.078 --> 27:27.080
a disaster in the area.

27:27.210 --> 27:30.823
You might could say I
use it for news purposes.

27:30.953 --> 27:31.954
Why do ya ask?

27:34.653 --> 27:36.480
You listen to
anything last night?

27:36.611 --> 27:37.830
Yeah.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.136
Anything sound a bit unusual?

27:40.267 --> 27:41.311
Not that I can think of.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.359
Okay.

27:45.489 --> 27:49.580
There was a wreck up by
the junction and a man

27:49.711 --> 27:51.452
was reported missing
near Abel Station.

27:51.582 --> 27:52.496
Missing persons?

27:52.627 --> 27:53.541
Yeah.

27:56.109 --> 27:58.154
That's not unusual.

27:58.285 --> 28:01.201
A lotta guys up and leave
their wives for younger legs.

28:02.593 --> 28:04.073
The way of the world, Sheriff.

28:05.379 --> 28:06.336
The way of the world.

28:08.991 --> 28:10.471
Okay, thanks, Georgia.

28:10.601 --> 28:13.430
Hey, do me a favor.

28:13.561 --> 28:14.562
Let me know if anything
strange comes

28:14.693 --> 28:16.390
across these channels, okay?

28:16.520 --> 28:17.521
Anything I should know about?

28:17.652 --> 28:20.002
No, just wanna keep my ear close

28:20.133 --> 28:22.483
to the ground, that's all.

28:22.613 --> 28:25.878
I hate to tell ya, Joe,
but nothing too exciting

28:26.008 --> 28:27.531
happens around here.

28:27.662 --> 28:28.881
Yeah, that's what they
keep telling me.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.275
Can I give you some advice?

28:32.406 --> 28:33.363
Sure.

28:33.494 --> 28:36.671
Not all places are bad.

28:36.802 --> 28:40.370
Some places attract bad folks,
but don't go looking

28:40.501 --> 28:41.981
for trouble if there's
none to find.

28:45.071 --> 28:46.115
Thanks for the advice.

28:47.203 --> 28:48.422
Have a good day.

28:54.602 --> 28:57.257
[birds chirping]

28:59.128 --> 29:01.740
[engine rumbling]

29:03.002 --> 29:04.046
[Liz] Teddy, you copy?

29:06.309 --> 29:08.529
Go for Teddy.

29:08.659 --> 29:11.097
[Liz] Where the hell did
you disappear off to?

29:11.227 --> 29:13.752
I'm looking for Bernard's dog.

29:13.882 --> 29:15.231
He said he might be out
here on MacDaniels Road

29:15.362 --> 29:17.277
chasing jackrabbits.

29:17.407 --> 29:18.408
[Liz] So, then where are you?

29:20.193 --> 29:22.717
MacDaniels Road, Liz.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.371
[Liz] Copy that, see
you when you get back.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.722
Y'all ever get rid of Bill?

29:27.853 --> 29:29.506

45:09.141 --> 45:11.317
his usual crazy nonsense.

45:11.447 --> 45:13.362
This time something about
people on his property

45:13.493 --> 45:15.277
doing some weird stuff.

45:15.408 --> 45:17.584
[Bobby] Weird stuff?

45:17.715 --> 45:19.281
Yeah, he said to look
out for the phone lines.

45:19.412 --> 45:20.761
What does that mean?

45:20.892 --> 45:21.719
Uh, the phone lines.

45:21.849 --> 45:23.546
He said...

45:23.677 --> 45:25.679
He was going on about
communications.

45:25.810 --> 45:28.726
Teddy, where are the sheriff
and Liz headed to now?

45:31.293 --> 45:32.251
Bill's place.

45:35.515 --> 45:38.953
[birds chirping]

45:39.084 --> 45:41.608
[ominous music]

46:38.230 --> 46:39.100
[Liz] That looks like blood.

46:42.582 --> 46:43.713
Yes, it does.

47:01.383 --> 47:02.123
What is that?

47:08.477 --> 47:09.261
He mine the place?

47:10.740 --> 47:12.438
It would appear that way now,
wouldn't it?

47:15.441 --> 47:16.572
Where's Bill?

47:18.400 --> 47:19.488
I don't know.

47:27.061 --> 47:29.759
[eerie music]

47:32.458 --> 47:33.502
[Liz] Sheriff?

47:35.374 --> 47:37.028
Sheriff?

47:37.158 --> 47:38.116
[Sheriff] Give me a second.

47:40.335 --> 47:41.336
Joe!

47:41.467 --> 47:44.252
[suspenseful music]

47:49.344 --> 47:51.564
[monster grumbling]
[dramatic music]

47:51.694 --> 47:57.048
[guts crunching]
[Liz screaming]

47:57.178 --> 48:00.094
[monster screeching]

48:03.837 --> 48:05.839
[gun banging]

48:05.970 --> 48:08.363
[monster screeches]

48:08.494 --> 48:10.975
[ominous music]

48:16.589 --> 48:18.678
[crickets chirping]

48:31.821 --> 48:34.650
[suspenseful music]

48:39.220 --> 48:41.875
[dramatic music]

49:07.857 --> 49:10.948
[crickets chirping]

49:11.078 --> 49:12.036
This is Teddy for Joe.

49:12.166 --> 49:13.211
Come in, Joe.

49:13.341 --> 49:15.909
[static buzzing]
[light ominous music]

49:16.040 --> 49:17.432
Liz, do you read me?

49:17.563 --> 49:19.957
[static buzzing]

49:20.087 --> 49:21.697
Liz, give me a read here.
Anything.

49:23.873 --> 49:25.614
[Georgia] Maybe they're
talking to Bill.

49:25.745 --> 49:28.008
Sure, maybe they aren't
by their radio.

49:28.139 --> 49:29.923
No.

49:30.054 --> 49:33.448
No, a big city cop we're
talking about here.

49:33.579 --> 49:35.581
He ain't dumb.

49:35.711 --> 49:38.018
He done do things the
way we do here.

49:38.149 --> 49:39.324
What's that supposed to mean?

49:39.454 --> 49:41.369
He just means Joe's a
skeptical guy, that's all.

49:41.500 --> 49:43.154
I can clarify that.

49:43.284 --> 49:44.546
Even with Bill's
crazy ass stories

49:44.677 --> 49:45.983
he still wanted to investigate.

49:47.897 --> 49:49.116
I guess it takes somebody
from out of town

49:49.247 --> 49:51.727
to think that guy's not
totally off his nut.

49:51.858 --> 49:53.338
I wonder if Timmy's
folks have a CB.

49:54.904 --> 49:57.124
[Bobby] All right,
so what do we do?

49:57.255 --> 49:59.213
Why the hell you
looking at me for?

49:59.344 --> 50:00.780
There's your new leader
of the pack right there.

50:00.910 --> 50:02.303
[tense music]
No, no.

50:02.434 --> 50:04.001
Joe will be back.

50:04.131 --> 50:05.959
All right, he'll be back.
We just stay put.

50:06.090 --> 50:08.744
And what do we do if he
don't come back?

50:08.875 --> 50:09.832
All right.

50:11.399 --> 50:13.314
I'm gonna drive my rig
over to Bill's,

50:14.446 --> 50:15.882
see what I can drum up.

50:17.884 --> 50:20.278
I'll stay on the short
wave and listen

50:20.408 --> 50:22.671
for anything that comes in.

50:22.802 --> 50:24.543
All right, I guess I'll
make the rounds

50:24.673 --> 50:26.110
and make sure that
everybody's staying calm.

50:26.240 --> 50:27.589
And I guess I better
go make sure Bernard's

50:27.720 --> 50:29.722
not out looking for
his goddamn dog.

50:29.852 --> 50:32.029
Just stay calm, I'll go over
and check on Harry and Deanna

50:32.159 --> 50:34.553
and I'll fill them in
on the situation, Teddy.

50:34.683 --> 50:35.467
All right, Bobby.

50:43.562 --> 50:48.306
[crickets chirping]
[ominous music]

50:50.569 --> 50:52.440
Hey, Rick.

50:52.571 --> 50:53.789
I thought you were leaving.

50:54.877 --> 50:56.749
Look, I got a problem.

50:56.879 --> 50:59.404
- Somebody ran off with my--
- Somebody lifted my battery.

51:02.624 --> 51:04.626
[Teddy sighs]

51:04.757 --> 51:06.454
How much you wanna bet
every other vehicle

51:06.585 --> 51:08.717
on this block is inoperable?

51:10.632 --> 51:11.807
Bet you $5.

51:14.375 --> 51:16.856
[ominous music]

51:24.559 --> 51:26.039
Someone don't want us leavin'.

51:29.216 --> 51:31.479
[eerie music]

51:37.659 --> 51:41.098
[dramatic music]

51:41.228 --> 51:43.665
Um, hello?

51:46.494 --> 51:48.279
Though I could pretty much
guarantee that I got nothing

51:48.409 --> 51:50.716
in the shop that's gonna
fit in that cruiser.

51:50.846 --> 51:52.457
But if the lines are
back up I can give

51:52.587 --> 51:53.849
a call into Ingram
tomorrow morning

51:53.980 --> 51:55.503
and that's the best I
can do for you.

51:55.634 --> 51:57.331
I appreciate it, Rick.

51:57.462 --> 51:59.028
I've seen enough weird
shit in the last 24 hours,

51:59.159 --> 52:00.508
I don't wanna wait till
tomorrow morning.

52:01.683 --> 52:03.163
Okay.

52:03.294 --> 52:04.512
You have somewhere
secure to hole up?

52:04.643 --> 52:05.426
I'm right here.

52:06.514 --> 52:07.385
All right.

52:07.515 --> 52:09.169
[dramatic music]

52:09.300 --> 52:10.083
What do you want?

52:16.481 --> 52:17.308
Harry!

52:18.352 --> 52:19.875
Teddy!

52:20.006 --> 52:21.486
Someone!

52:21.616 --> 52:22.487
Help!

52:24.576 --> 52:26.360
Rick, you stay here.

52:26.491 --> 52:29.581
[suspenseful music]

52:36.762 --> 52:38.720
Harry! Teddy!

52:38.851 --> 52:39.808
Teddy!

52:39.939 --> 52:41.332
Somebody help!

52:41.462 --> 52:44.030
[Deanna screaming]

52:46.032 --> 52:48.687
[gun banging]

52:48.817 --> 52:50.297
Where's the other one?

52:50.428 --> 52:51.472
What other one?

52:51.603 --> 52:52.952
[dramatic music]
[thudding]

52:53.082 --> 52:56.173
[groaning]

52:58.566 --> 53:01.569
[thudding]

53:01.700 --> 53:03.267
[heavy breathing]

53:03.397 --> 53:04.311
Come on.

53:04.442 --> 53:07.053
[thudding]
[yelling]

53:07.184 --> 53:11.884
[guts squishing]
[Deanna grunting]

53:12.014 --> 53:13.277
Die!

53:13.407 --> 53:16.018
[heavy breathing]

53:20.458 --> 53:22.547
[ominous music]

53:22.677 --> 53:24.113
All right, you stay put, Bobby.

53:24.244 --> 53:25.593
Okay, you guys.

53:25.724 --> 53:26.855
I want you to get inside!

53:29.554 --> 53:31.686
All right, come on you
sons of bitches.

53:31.817 --> 53:32.687
Close the door!

53:32.818 --> 53:34.036
Harry, no, come on.

53:34.167 --> 53:35.864
- No, no, no, no.
- Come on.

53:35.995 --> 53:38.215
Shut the goddamn door!

53:38.345 --> 53:40.042
Harry!
[door slams]

53:40.173 --> 53:42.306
[Harry yells]
[dramatic music]

53:42.436 --> 53:43.698
[thudding]

53:43.829 --> 53:47.006
[groaning]

53:55.014 --> 53:59.845
[crickets chirping]

54:04.153 --> 54:06.678
[ominous music]

54:20.300 --> 54:21.562
Show yourselves!

54:21.693 --> 54:25.131
[suspenseful music]

54:25.262 --> 54:26.132
Come on!

54:32.051 --> 54:34.793
I ain't in the mood for
no hide and seek.

54:50.069 --> 54:52.637
[gun banging]

54:52.767 --> 54:55.422
[light dramatic music]

54:55.553 --> 54:58.338
[crickets chirping]

55:04.431 --> 55:06.651
[ominous music]

55:06.781 --> 55:08.914
What's with all the gunshots?

55:09.044 --> 55:11.308
I'm not so sure I know
what's going on.

55:14.659 --> 55:15.921
It's better we stay here.

55:19.272 --> 55:20.839
[Bobby] Gunshots from
Rick's place.

55:22.710 --> 55:23.668
Can you see him?

55:25.278 --> 55:27.846
No, but Rick's a smart fella.

55:27.976 --> 55:29.108
Yeah, well smarts don't
matter if they get

55:29.238 --> 55:31.066
the jump on you like
these fellas have.

55:31.197 --> 55:32.024
We've seen that.

55:33.678 --> 55:34.983
How the hell do they
move so fast?

55:35.114 --> 55:36.071
Who are these people?

55:37.812 --> 55:38.639
I don't know.

55:41.250 --> 55:43.296
We have any guns in here?

55:43.427 --> 55:44.950
No.
[Cindy crying]

55:45.080 --> 55:46.778
Harry's always hated the
damned things.

55:48.127 --> 55:49.302
Yeah.

55:49.433 --> 55:52.174
[suspenseful music]

56:04.970 --> 56:07.015
[dramatic music]

56:07.146 --> 56:08.930
[gun banging ]

56:14.632 --> 56:17.417
[suspenseful music]

56:23.597 --> 56:25.120
All right.

56:25.251 --> 56:26.470
Wanna dance?

56:29.690 --> 56:30.648
Let's tango.

56:32.432 --> 56:35.261
[dramatic music]

56:37.916 --> 56:39.396
Son of a bitch.

56:41.398 --> 56:43.312
How many of you
fuckers are there?

56:47.665 --> 56:50.407
[suspenseful music]

56:53.192 --> 56:54.411
See ya, kitties.

56:56.935 --> 56:59.764
[gun bangs]
[booming]

56:59.894 --> 57:00.895
Shit.

57:01.026 --> 57:03.855
[tense music]

57:03.985 --> 57:05.030
Holy shit.

57:06.205 --> 57:08.599
Oh, my God.

57:08.729 --> 57:10.427
All right, I gotta get
back to the station.

57:11.689 --> 57:12.864
You can't go out there.

57:12.994 --> 57:14.561
Yeah, she's right, Teddy,
you can't.

57:14.692 --> 57:16.084
No, there's no other option.

57:17.608 --> 57:18.522
Why?

57:19.958 --> 57:22.221
I got another revolver
in the office,

57:22.351 --> 57:24.745
ammo, and I'm pretty sure
I have a shotgun

57:24.876 --> 57:25.964
in the back of the cruiser.

57:27.313 --> 57:29.446
Shit, it might be in
Joe's cruiser.

57:29.576 --> 57:31.099
Come on. Think, Teddy, think.

57:33.841 --> 57:34.712
Teddy.

57:34.842 --> 57:35.756
Here.

57:36.975 --> 57:38.106
Take that.

57:38.237 --> 57:40.239
My god, what is this
thing doing in here?

57:40.369 --> 57:41.501
Harry always made us
keep it in case

57:41.632 --> 57:43.155
anybody ever tried to
rob the place.

57:44.852 --> 57:47.028
[gentle music]
[both laughing]

57:47.159 --> 57:48.769
Yeah, right.

57:48.900 --> 57:49.988
Yeah, as if.

57:50.989 --> 57:52.817
Okay.

57:52.947 --> 57:55.863
It's only about 100 feet
to the station, all right?

57:55.994 --> 57:57.299
As soon as I get in
there I can try

57:57.430 --> 57:59.432
and hail somebody on
the short wave.

57:59.563 --> 58:01.042
Hang in there, okay?

58:01.173 --> 58:02.522
All right.

58:02.653 --> 58:04.350
Hey, y'all, there's
something moving in there.

58:06.308 --> 58:08.006
[suspenseful music]

58:08.136 --> 58:09.094
[Teddy] What the hell?

58:09.224 --> 58:11.183
Is that one of us?

58:11.313 --> 58:12.576
[Teddy] I think it's Rick.

58:12.706 --> 58:14.447
[Bobby] Yeah.

58:14.578 --> 58:17.232
[Rick coughing]

58:24.413 --> 58:27.416
[Rick gasping]

58:27.547 --> 58:29.027
Bernard!

58:32.421 --> 58:33.771
[monster grumbling]

58:33.901 --> 58:35.816
Bernard?

58:35.947 --> 58:36.861
Bernard!

58:38.906 --> 58:43.650
[ominous music]
[monster grumbling]

58:49.308 --> 58:51.919
[dramatic eerie music]

58:53.965 --> 58:56.794
[suspenseful music]

58:59.666 --> 59:02.321
[monster roaring]
[eerie music]

59:02.451 --> 59:05.716
[Cindy screams]

59:05.846 --> 59:06.978
What happened?

59:08.457 --> 59:11.286
[suspenseful music]

59:14.855 --> 59:16.335
[thudding]
[dramatic music]

59:16.465 --> 59:19.033
[Cindy screaming]

59:22.776 --> 59:27.564
[light dramatic music]
[Cindy screams]

59:29.870 --> 59:31.959
[gun bangs]

59:32.090 --> 59:33.700
[ominous music]
Come on, come on.

59:35.180 --> 59:37.356
[Cindy shrieks]

59:37.486 --> 59:38.575
- Hurry, come on.
- Come on.

59:38.705 --> 59:39.576
Come on.

59:45.886 --> 59:47.105
Where's Rick?

59:48.672 --> 59:49.542
He didn't make it.

59:51.718 --> 59:54.068
We watched him go into
Bernard's and...

59:56.331 --> 59:57.332
Oh, my God.

59:59.813 --> 01:00:02.120
What is going on?

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:04.949
Georgia, have you been
keeping an ear on the radio?

01:00:05.079 --> 01:00:07.038
Yeah, but there's nothing.

01:00:07.168 --> 01:00:07.952
[Teddy] Nothing?

01:00:08.082 --> 01:00:08.996
Nothing.

01:00:09.127 --> 01:00:10.519
Nothing from Joe or Liz?

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:11.564
Nothing.

01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:15.655
Mom, do you think we
can call out?

01:00:15.786 --> 01:00:18.310
Best we could do is
broadcast out

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.879
and hope somebody driving
by has their radio on.

01:00:22.009 --> 01:00:23.576
Yeah, that's a hell
of a long shot.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.624
But it could work.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.584
You got any more
shells for that?

01:00:31.715 --> 01:00:33.978
The two shells I just
spent have been sitting

01:00:34.108 --> 01:00:35.719
in this thing for seven years.

01:00:35.849 --> 01:00:38.896
Why the fuck would I have
any more shells?

01:00:39.026 --> 01:00:40.462
Okay, Georgia.

01:00:40.593 --> 01:00:42.900
Well, I have more shells but
they're back at the station.

01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.988
Yeah.

01:00:44.118 --> 01:00:45.990
Mom, you got here
with no problem,

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.645
so maybe Teddy can get back
down a few doors without issue.

01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:50.298
How many of them are there?

01:00:52.474 --> 01:00:53.867
We don't even know, do we?

01:00:56.348 --> 01:00:58.045
Do we even know what they want?

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.009
There was something else.

01:01:08.316 --> 01:01:09.448
What do you mean, Cindy?

01:01:11.232 --> 01:01:13.582
There is something in
those trees.

01:01:15.236 --> 01:01:16.760
It got Rick.

01:01:18.587 --> 01:01:20.938
What like another one
of those people?

01:01:21.068 --> 01:01:22.026
No, no.

01:01:22.156 --> 01:01:24.245
It was like something inhuman.

01:01:38.738 --> 01:01:40.348
I'm gonna have to go
to the station.

01:01:41.436 --> 01:01:42.829
Teddy, you can't.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:43.743
It's okay, Deanna.

01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:45.876
It's my job.

01:01:47.965 --> 01:01:51.098
All right, y'all are
gonna have to stay here.

01:01:51.229 --> 01:01:52.447
Hold this place down.

01:01:52.578 --> 01:01:53.492
As soon as I leave you lock

01:01:53.622 --> 01:01:54.667
this place up, you understand,
Bobby?

01:01:54.798 --> 01:01:55.668
All right.

01:01:57.844 --> 01:01:59.716
Deanna, you still
have that radio?

01:02:05.112 --> 01:02:06.548
[Bobby sighing]

01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:10.117
Yeah, okay.

01:02:10.248 --> 01:02:12.337
All right, I can use this
to call you guys

01:02:12.467 --> 01:02:14.339
from the station but you
won't be able to respond.

01:02:15.601 --> 01:02:17.255
Take this.

01:02:17.385 --> 01:02:19.561
Do you a lot more good than us.

01:02:19.692 --> 01:02:20.606
Georgia, what the hell
am I gonna do

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.042
with an empty shotgun?

01:02:22.173 --> 01:02:24.088
[Georgia sighing]

01:02:24.218 --> 01:02:26.699
Look, I got another
pistol in the office.

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.919
I'll get you some more
shells for that

01:02:29.049 --> 01:02:30.529
and then I'll hustle back here.

01:02:30.659 --> 01:02:32.226
And then what?

01:02:32.357 --> 01:02:33.619
As soon as the sun comes up

01:02:35.447 --> 01:02:37.318
I will walk us outta
here if I have to.

01:02:37.449 --> 01:02:39.799
[ominous music]

01:02:42.323 --> 01:02:43.324
Okay.

01:02:44.586 --> 01:02:45.762
[Georgia] What are they doing?

01:02:53.421 --> 01:02:55.206
What are they doing?

01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:56.337
What the hell?

01:02:59.384 --> 01:03:02.082
[monster grumbling]

01:03:02.213 --> 01:03:03.954
They're feeding
whatever's in there.

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:14.573
I'm not so sure going
out there is the best.

01:03:20.709 --> 01:03:22.842
Must've gone out back, I'm
gonna make sure it's locked.

01:03:26.933 --> 01:03:29.936
[crickets chirping]

01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:39.990
[suspenseful music]

01:03:45.038 --> 01:03:47.824
[dramatic music]

01:03:47.954 --> 01:03:48.868
[Teddy] Come on.

01:03:48.999 --> 01:03:50.000
Okay.

01:03:54.221 --> 01:03:56.267
[thudding]

01:04:03.709 --> 01:04:07.539
[thudding]
[Teddy groaning]

01:04:12.196 --> 01:04:16.200
[Teddy groaning]
[thudding]

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:20.857
Come on. Come on.

01:04:22.336 --> 01:04:24.599
[thudding]

01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:26.863
[groaning]

01:04:26.993 --> 01:04:29.822
[gun bangs]

01:04:31.258 --> 01:04:36.002
Get the hell inside now!
[tense upbeat music]

01:04:41.312 --> 01:04:42.835
Come on, come on!

01:04:42.966 --> 01:04:45.098
[gun bangs]

01:04:46.665 --> 01:04:47.666
[door thuds]

01:04:47.796 --> 01:04:51.061
[grunting]

01:04:51.191 --> 01:04:52.714
Jesus Christ!

01:04:52.845 --> 01:04:53.933
Joe, you're alive!

01:04:54.064 --> 01:04:54.891
Oh yeah.

01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:58.329
Here.

01:04:58.459 --> 01:05:00.418
Anybody comes through
that door, you kill it.

01:05:00.548 --> 01:05:03.203
[heavy breathing]

01:05:03.334 --> 01:05:04.378
Where's Liz?

01:05:11.385 --> 01:05:13.257
What the hell's going on here,
Joe?

01:05:13.387 --> 01:05:14.693
Oh, haven't you heard?

01:05:14.823 --> 01:05:16.129
Some asshole said
some fancy words

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.262
and raised a goddamn
demon outta hell.

01:05:18.392 --> 01:05:20.829
[rustling]

01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:24.050
What the hell do they want?

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:26.487
Ain't it obvious?

01:05:32.276 --> 01:05:34.191
We saw them feeding it.

01:05:34.321 --> 01:05:35.670
There you go.

01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:38.108
Serving us up like dinner
on a goddamn silver platter.

01:05:38.238 --> 01:05:39.065
Shit.

01:05:41.154 --> 01:05:43.330
They're even feeding
it their dead.

01:05:43.461 --> 01:05:46.072
[heavy breathing]

01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:52.513
You saw it, didn't you, Joe?

01:05:54.733 --> 01:05:56.430
Up close and personal.

01:05:57.649 --> 01:05:58.867
How'd you get away from it?

01:06:01.783 --> 01:06:05.526
I wined it, dined it,
and then I claymore mined it.

01:06:07.006 --> 01:06:08.573
Where were you?

01:06:08.703 --> 01:06:11.837
[Joe] Bill's front yard.

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.056
Joe.

01:06:14.448 --> 01:06:15.710
Look in the evidence locker.

01:06:16.929 --> 01:06:19.801
[suspenseful music]

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:27.331
Holy shit.

01:06:29.376 --> 01:06:30.769
Where the hell did you get this?

01:06:30.899 --> 01:06:32.205
We caught Bill using
it a couple years back

01:06:32.336 --> 01:06:34.120
trying to get rid of a
mole problem.

01:06:34.251 --> 01:06:36.818
The sheriff before, he had
to wrestle it away from him.

01:06:36.949 --> 01:06:38.298
Thank you, Bill.

01:06:40.518 --> 01:06:41.910
Where the hell are these guys?

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:44.435
[tense upbeat music]

01:06:44.565 --> 01:06:45.914
Who's left?

01:06:46.045 --> 01:06:48.482
We've got Cindy, Georgia,
Bobby and Deanna

01:06:48.613 --> 01:06:49.788
all locked in at the grille.

01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:52.921
All right.

01:06:53.052 --> 01:06:54.401
You gotta make sure that
they stay alive,

01:06:54.532 --> 01:06:55.402
and when the time is right,

01:06:55.533 --> 01:06:57.230
you're gonna get
them outta town.

01:06:57.361 --> 01:06:59.015
How am I gonna do that?

01:06:59.145 --> 01:07:01.626
Oh, we're gonna level the
playing field.

01:07:01.756 --> 01:07:04.194
Where they feeding him at?

01:07:04.324 --> 01:07:05.804
Uh, last we saw it was over
at Bernard's tree farm,

01:07:05.934 --> 01:07:08.067
but shit, it could be
anywhere by now.

01:07:10.983 --> 01:07:12.506
Rick told me you were
a good football player.

01:07:12.637 --> 01:07:13.768
Is that true?

01:07:13.899 --> 01:07:15.683
I was back in high school, why?

01:07:17.381 --> 01:07:19.035
I want you to run
straight up the middle,

01:07:19.165 --> 01:07:21.037
draw as many of those
Michael Myers wannabes

01:07:21.167 --> 01:07:22.125
with you as you can.

01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:24.388
Okay.

01:07:25.563 --> 01:07:26.781
Who's Michael Myers?

01:07:29.871 --> 01:07:32.352
Oh, for Christ's sakes
just holster this thing up.

01:07:33.571 --> 01:07:34.702
What are you gonna do?

01:07:37.357 --> 01:07:40.752
Oh, I have a date with a
big toothy horny monster

01:07:40.882 --> 01:07:42.493
and it's about to get fucked!

01:07:44.016 --> 01:07:45.757
Okay, okay.

01:07:45.887 --> 01:07:48.542
[heavy breathing]

01:07:49.891 --> 01:07:50.805
Georgia.

01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:57.986
I'm over at the sheriff's
station and Joe's here,

01:07:58.117 --> 01:08:00.685
he's, he's alive.

01:08:00.815 --> 01:08:02.643
I'm on the way back to you,
Georgia.

01:08:02.774 --> 01:08:04.515
God, I hope you can hear this.

01:08:04.645 --> 01:08:06.256
You better be ready to get
that door open.

01:08:06.386 --> 01:08:07.518
[dramatic music]

01:08:07.648 --> 01:08:10.347

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.005
Mom, Mom.

01:08:17.136 --> 01:08:19.006
Bobby, no!

01:08:19.138 --> 01:08:21.618
[Bobby groans]

01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:26.102
Oh, my God.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.844
Go get some towels!

01:08:29.975 --> 01:08:32.412
- Bobby, Bobby.
- Here, here, here.

01:08:32.542 --> 01:08:35.850
How did he stab him?
[Bobby screaming]

01:08:35.981 --> 01:08:38.723
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,
look at me.

01:08:38.853 --> 01:08:40.594
Duct tape or any other
kind of tape.

01:08:40.725 --> 01:08:41.987
[Deanna] I don't see any.

01:08:43.206 --> 01:08:44.511
[Georgia] Breathe, Bobby.

01:08:44.642 --> 01:08:45.904
Breathe, breathe.

01:08:46.033 --> 01:08:47.122
Breathe, Bobby.

01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:49.341
- Bobby, look at me.
[Georgia] Really tight.

01:08:49.473 --> 01:08:51.475
[Georgia] It's gonna be
okay. You'll be okay.

01:08:51.604 --> 01:08:54.173
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:55.827
Don't say that, don't say that.

01:08:55.957 --> 01:08:57.611
There's nothing to be sorry for.

01:08:57.742 --> 01:08:59.743
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

01:09:01.876 --> 01:09:03.617
It's okay, it's okay.

01:09:03.747 --> 01:09:04.749
Just breathe son.

01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:06.185
[Cindy] Deanna, put some
pressure on him.

01:09:06.316 --> 01:09:07.447
Bobby, stay with me.

01:09:07.578 --> 01:09:09.319
Look at me, look at me.

01:09:09.448 --> 01:09:10.319
Look at me.

01:09:11.363 --> 01:09:13.540
[Bobby groaning]

01:09:13.671 --> 01:09:14.541
Bobby.

01:09:18.023 --> 01:09:20.852
It's all right,
you're gonna be okay.

01:09:20.982 --> 01:09:23.942
Bobby, Bobby, come back to me.

01:09:24.072 --> 01:09:25.551
Come back.

01:09:25.683 --> 01:09:26.858
- It's okay.
- I'm okay.

01:09:26.988 --> 01:09:30.296
Just breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe, breathe.

01:09:30.426 --> 01:09:32.385
No, slow, slow.

01:09:32.515 --> 01:09:34.908
It's okay, it's okay.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.345
It'll be okay.

01:09:36.475 --> 01:09:37.999
You're gonna be okay.

01:09:39.653 --> 01:09:41.698

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:47.678
Yeah.

01:10:47.808 --> 01:10:49.680
He died just a few minutes ago.

01:10:52.944 --> 01:10:54.250
I'm sorry.

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.338
It's not your fault.

01:10:55.468 --> 01:10:56.513
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

01:10:56.643 --> 01:10:58.428
I was just...

[Teddy sniffles]
[somber music]

01:11:01.344 --> 01:11:02.606
Help me.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:09.352
Joe.

01:11:13.747 --> 01:11:15.053
