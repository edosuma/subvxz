<i>Here comes the President's helicopter,
Marine helicopter number one...</i>

00:46.253 --> 00:50.212
<i>landing in the Plaza on the east
side of the east front of the Capitol.</i>

00:50.573 --> 00:53.565
<i>Helicopter hovering
gently, just off the ground.</i>

00:54.533 --> 00:57.923
<i>Amazing timing. The President flying
all the way across the world...</i>

00:58.013 --> 00:59.492
<i>across the Atlantic Ocean...</i>

00:59.573 --> 01:03.771
<i>arriving almost exactly
as scheduled at 9:30...</i>

01:04.132 --> 01:05.566
<i>in the Capitol Plaza...</i>

01:05.653 --> 01:08.292
<i>so that he can go up the steps

01:08.373 --> 01:12.048
<i>go into the chamber, and address the
members of the House and the Senate...</i>

01:12.133 --> 01:14.886
<i>the Supreme Court, the
diplomatic corps of Washington...</i>

01:14.973 --> 01:17.009
<i>all of whom are inside
waiting for him...</i>

01:17.093 --> 01:18.890
<i>in the chamber of the
House of Representatives.</i>

01:18.973 --> 01:20.292
<i>Mr. Speaker...</i>

01:20.373 --> 01:23.171
<i>the President of the United States.</i>

01:30.413 --> 01:33.086
<i>And the President, accompanied
by the Escort Committee...</i>

01:33.173 --> 01:36.529
<i>comes down the central aisle,
approaching the podium...</i>

01:37.853 --> 01:39.206
<i>greets members of his Cabinet...</i>

01:39.293 --> 01:42.410
<i>and those who are waiting to be
confirmed as members of his Cabinet...</i>

01:42.493 --> 01:44.484
<i>as he reaches the rostrum.</i>

01:47.413 --> 01:50.052
<i>Shakes hands with the
Speaker, Carl Albert...</i>

01:50.733 --> 01:52.724
<i>A happy President, smiling.</i>

01:54.013 --> 01:57.050
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, President
Nixon will, in a moment...</i>

01:57.133 --> 02:00.603
<i>address the Congress and the
people of the United States.</i>

02:03.253 --> 02:04.322
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:55.733 --> 03:58.042
<i>Car 727. Car 727.</i>

03:58.133 --> 04:00.283
<i>Open door at the
Watergate office building.</i>

04:00.373 --> 04:02.807
<i>Possible burglary.
See the security guard.</i>

04:02.893 --> 04:04.690
Are you sure you want us?

04:04.853 --> 04:06.844
517 is closer and they're in uniform.

04:06.933 --> 04:09.083
<i>They're getting gas. You take it.</i>

04:30.613 --> 04:32.171
Unit 1 to Unit 2.

04:34.213 --> 04:35.726
Unit 1 to Unit 2.

04:36.213 --> 04:38.204
<i>- What?
- We're home.</i>

04:55.493 --> 04:57.211
Base 1 to Unit 1.

04:58.293 --> 04:59.612
Base 1 to Unit 1.

05:00.453 --> 05:02.205
<i>We have some activity here.</i>

05:02.893 --> 05:04.372
<i>Silence is advised.</i>

05:07.813 --> 05:08.962
Shut it off.

05:17.973 --> 05:19.531
Base 1 to Unit 1.

05:20.373 --> 05:22.204
Lights on the eighth floor.

05:23.053 --> 05:24.611
Base 1 to Unit 1.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.051
Is there anybody there?

05:33.813 --> 05:36.611
There's people, people on
the balcony. Armed people.

05:39.093 --> 05:40.731
Base 1 to Unit 1.

05:43.173 --> 05:46.483
Base 1 to Unit 1. We
may have some problems.

05:51.973 --> 05:53.372
Someone's here.

06:18.613 --> 06:20.763
- Hold it, you...
- Police!

06:21.813 --> 06:23.166
Put your hands up!

06:33.773 --> 06:35.126
Drop that jacket!

06:37.413 --> 06:41.042
Walkie-talkie, two 35mm cameras.

06:41.933 --> 06:43.651
Got it. That's good.

06:44.093 --> 06:45.606
All right, stay there.

06:46.373 --> 06:48.284
I already got something
for you. Did you see this?

06:48.373 --> 06:50.204
A couple sleeping in
bed, car hits the house...

06:50.293 --> 06:52.204
goes through the bedroom,
comes out the other side.

06:52.293 --> 06:53.567
Good morning. Crash.

06:53.653 --> 06:55.644
Lewis is over at
Democratic headquarters.

06:55.733 --> 06:58.042
One of the burglars had $814.

06:58.253 --> 07:01.609
One $230, one $215, and one $234.

07:01.893 --> 07:05.568
Most of it was in $100
bills and in sequence.

07:06.253 --> 07:07.527
<i>- Woodward?
- Yeah?</i>

07:07.613 --> 07:09.569
There's been a break-in at
the Democratic headquarters.

07:09.653 --> 07:11.564
<i>- There's been an arrest.
- Local Democratic headquarters.</i>

07:11.653 --> 07:12.688
<i>They were bugging the place.</i>

07:12.773 --> 07:15.128
<i>Check the time of arraignment,
and get over there.</i>

07:15.213 --> 07:17.886
<i>And, Woodward, it was National
Democratic headquarters.</i>

07:17.973 --> 07:19.247
All right.

07:20.613 --> 07:22.524
- Anything else?
- Anything else?

07:22.853 --> 07:25.731
Break-in, car crash. That's
not bad for a Saturday.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.531
Okay, let me know what
happens. Hello, Carl.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.841
Got anything on that couple?

07:28.933 --> 07:31.208
Harry, I know somebody on
the staff over at Watergate.

07:31.293 --> 07:34.524
Bernstein, why don't you finish one
story before trying to get on another?

07:34.613 --> 07:35.966
I finished it.

07:36.293 --> 07:38.170
- The Virginia Legislature story?
- I finished it.

07:38.253 --> 07:39.845
All right, give it to me.

07:40.253 --> 07:42.687
I'm just polishing it.
I'll work the phones.

07:42.773 --> 07:45.048
Polishing it? Yeah, you work the phones.

07:50.693 --> 07:54.083
Excuse me, I'm sorry, who are the lawyers
for the five men arrested at Watergate?

07:54.173 --> 07:55.208
Do you know?

07:55.293 --> 07:57.602
- Well, these two were assigned to it.
- I'm sorry?

07:57.693 --> 07:59.923
These two were appointed to the case.

08:00.133 --> 08:03.045
But only now it turns out the
burglars have their own counsel.

08:03.133 --> 08:05.249
- The burglars have their own counsel?
- That's right.

08:05.333 --> 08:07.289
That's kind of unusual,
wouldn't you say?

08:07.373 --> 08:08.965
For burglars it's unusual.

08:09.053 --> 08:12.602
- You know the name of the counsel? -
I don't know. Some country-club type.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.568
<i>You are charged with
soliciting prostitution...</i>

08:15.653 --> 08:17.530
<i>at 14th and east street.</i>

08:18.133 --> 08:21.409
And you get as your
solicitor, one Perry Woodstock.

08:21.853 --> 08:25.732
Your Honor, Mrs. Hawkin has in the past
been a reliable, hardworking parent.

08:25.813 --> 08:29.931
<i>Parents are sworn over. I think
$300 would be acceptable...</i>

08:30.013 --> 08:32.129
Excuse me, what is your name?

08:33.253 --> 08:35.847
<i>I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.</i>

08:36.972 --> 08:38.611
- Markham.
- Markham.

08:38.813 --> 08:42.361
Mr. Markham, are you here in
connection with the Watergate burglary?

08:43.173 --> 08:44.606
I'm not here.

08:47.773 --> 08:48.808
Okay.

08:51.173 --> 08:53.209
Well, clearly, I am here...

08:53.613 --> 08:56.650
but only as an individual,
not as the attorney of record.

08:56.773 --> 08:57.888
Who is?

08:58.653 --> 08:59.972
Mr. Starkey.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.403
- Do you have any...
- Whatever you want...

09:03.493 --> 09:06.769
you'll have to get it from
him. I have nothing more to say.

09:16.373 --> 09:18.125
<i>Starkey.
S-T-...</i>

09:22.613 --> 09:24.171
Mr. Starkey was very helpful.

09:24.253 --> 09:27.484
Four Cuban Americans and
another man, James W. McCord.

09:28.293 --> 09:31.251
Look, I told you inside,
I have nothing more to say.

09:31.333 --> 09:32.925
I understand that.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.326
What I don't understand
is how you got here.

09:36.973 --> 09:39.965
I assure you there's nothing
very mysterious involved.

09:40.133 --> 09:42.806
Well, a little while ago, I was
talking to a couple of the lawyers...

09:42.893 --> 09:44.611
assigned to represent the burglars.

09:44.693 --> 09:45.728
So?

09:45.813 --> 09:48.281
They never would have been assigned
to represent the burglars...

09:48.373 --> 09:51.171
had anyone known the burglars had
arranged for their own counsel.

09:51.253 --> 09:53.721
Only, the burglars couldn't have
arranged for their own counsel...

09:53.813 --> 09:56.122
since they never even made a phone call.

09:56.533 --> 09:59.445
So, if no one asked you to
be here, why are you here?

10:00.213 --> 10:02.124
<i>I don't want you to take
this personally, Mr...</i>

10:02.213 --> 10:03.646
- Woodward.
- Woodward.

10:04.013 --> 10:05.890
It'd be a mistake to do that.

10:06.613 --> 10:08.649
I just don't have anything to say.

10:19.653 --> 10:22.884
Did one of the other men
involved in the break-in call you?

10:24.253 --> 10:27.211
What reason do you have to assume
that there were other people involved?

10:27.293 --> 10:30.126
Well, one of your clients was
arrested with a walkie-talkie.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.805
They're not my clients.

10:33.173 --> 10:34.925
Now, I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

10:35.013 --> 10:37.243
You're a lawyer and you're here.

10:38.773 --> 10:42.448
One of the defendants, Mr. Barker,
and I met at a social occasion once.

10:42.533 --> 10:45.570
- Where?
- I have nothing else to say.

10:45.653 --> 10:46.688
A Miami social occasion?

10:46.773 --> 10:49.287
Mr. Starkey says the
Cubans were from Miami.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.964
L-62, James McCord.

10:52.053 --> 10:53.771
L-63, Bernard Barker.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.492
L-64, Virgil Gonzales.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.643
L-65, Eugenio Martinez.

10:58.773 --> 11:01.207
L-66, Frank Sturgis.

11:01.653 --> 11:03.803
Please step forward, Attorney Starkey.

11:03.893 --> 11:05.804
All charged with Burglary 2.

11:08.293 --> 11:11.251
- Mr. Starkey, will you represent all five?
- Yes, Your Honor.

11:11.333 --> 11:14.405
And are all five gentlemen charged
with burglary, second degree?

11:14.493 --> 11:15.528
Yes, Your Honor.

11:15.613 --> 11:18.127
Your names, please, and
state your professions.

11:18.373 --> 11:21.251
Bernard Barker, anti-communist.

11:22.013 --> 11:25.608
Anti-communist? That, sir, is
not your average profession.

11:28.253 --> 11:31.131
James McCord, security consultant.

11:31.253 --> 11:32.368
Where?

11:32.453 --> 11:35.286
Government. Recently retired.

11:35.733 --> 11:39.328
- Where in the government?
- Central Intelligence Agency.

11:39.773 --> 11:40.888
Where?

11:41.213 --> 11:42.362
The CIA.

11:43.173 --> 11:45.971
Sturgis, Frank A., salvage operator.

11:46.533 --> 11:47.807
Holy shit!

11:49.013 --> 11:51.607
Eugenio Martinez, known as Gene Valdez.

11:51.693 --> 11:53.888
James W. McCord, alias Edward Martin.

11:53.973 --> 11:55.770
Frank Sturgis, alias Frank Fiorini.

11:55.853 --> 11:57.650
All five of them had at least one alias.

11:57.733 --> 12:00.645
Is there any proof they were trying to
bug the National Democratic Chairman?

12:00.733 --> 12:02.405
It's obvious they were
trying to bug O'Brien.

12:02.493 --> 12:04.404
They wouldn't go to all that
trouble to bug secretaries.

12:04.493 --> 12:05.721
- There's no proof.
- Wait a minute.

12:05.813 --> 12:07.007
I called a lawyer in Miami I know.

12:07.093 --> 12:09.653
He said four of the guys who
were arrested were from Miami...

12:09.733 --> 12:12.008
Gonzales, Martinez, Sturgis, and Barker.

12:12.093 --> 12:15.688
<i>Yeah, Barker. And all four of them
were involved in CIA activities...</i>

12:15.773 --> 12:17.286
- No, they weren't.
- Yeah.

12:17.373 --> 12:20.445
No, only one of them was admitted
CIA, and the CIA won't confirm that.

12:20.533 --> 12:22.364
In fact, they deny even knowing McCord.

12:22.453 --> 12:25.570
Yeah, but I just think it's obvious
that with all that money and equipment...

12:25.653 --> 12:29.168
they weren't out to work by
themselves. Somebody hired them.

12:29.253 --> 12:30.971
I'm not interested in
what you think is obvious.

12:31.053 --> 12:32.122
I'm interested in what you know.

12:32.213 --> 12:34.852
What we don't know is why they
wanted to bug Democratic Headquarters.

12:34.933 --> 12:36.412
Whether they were
working for themselves...

12:36.493 --> 12:38.085
or other individuals
or other organizations.

12:38.173 --> 12:40.050
Could be a story, or
could just be crazy Cubans.

12:40.133 --> 12:42.169
Bachinski, when you get
there tonight, take it easy.

12:42.253 --> 12:43.811
The police are nervous.

12:52.093 --> 12:53.162
Yeah?

12:53.253 --> 12:54.891
<i>Bachinski, calling from
Police Headquarters.</i>

12:54.973 --> 12:57.282
<i>A friend just showed me what
they found in the hotel rooms...</i>

12:57.373 --> 12:58.408
<i>of the Watergate burglars.</i>

12:58.493 --> 13:00.449
<i>There's something here you
might want to look into.</i>

13:00.533 --> 13:02.808
Hang on. Okay, go ahead.

13:02.893 --> 13:05.851
<i>There's a strange entry in two
of the burglars'address books.</i>

13:05.933 --> 13:09.209
<i>- Yeah.
- One says, "H.H. At W.H."</i>

13:09.893 --> 13:12.726
<i>The other says,
"Howard Hunt, W. House".</i>

13:16.013 --> 13:17.890
You can dial the White
House direct, can't you?

13:17.973 --> 13:19.042
Yeah.

13:19.133 --> 13:22.887
- What's the
number? - 456-1414.

13:33.293 --> 13:35.648
<i>- White House.
- Howard Hunt, please.</i>

13:36.173 --> 13:38.289
<i>Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.</i>

13:38.573 --> 13:41.451
<i>He might be in Mr. Colson's
office. I'll connect you.</i>

13:42.093 --> 13:43.367
Thank you.

13:44.093 --> 13:46.653
<i>- Charles Colson's office.
- Howard Hunt, please.</i>

13:46.733 --> 13:49.884
<i>- Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.
- Do you know when he'll be back?</i>

13:49.973 --> 13:51.088
<i>No, I don't.</i>

13:51.533 --> 13:52.602
Okay, thank you.

13:52.693 --> 13:55.161
<i>- Have you tried the Mullen Firm?
- I beg your pardon?</i>

13:55.253 --> 13:58.051
<i>He also works as a writer at
Mullen & Company Public Relations.</i>

13:58.133 --> 14:00.124
Do you have a phone on
that or an address, please?

14:00.213 --> 14:01.771
<i>No, I don't. I'm sorry.</i>

14:02.133 --> 14:03.327
All right, thank you.

14:07.093 --> 14:08.162
Harry?

14:08.893 --> 14:10.406
Who's Charles Colson?

14:11.973 --> 14:13.611
Who's Charles Colson?

14:14.133 --> 14:15.202
Sit down.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.244
You know, I'm glad you
asked me that question.

14:18.333 --> 14:20.244
The reason I'm glad you
asked me is because...

14:20.333 --> 14:22.608
if you had asked Simons or
Bradlee, they would've said:

14:22.693 --> 14:26.402
"You know we're going to have to fire
this schmuck at once because he's so dumb!"

14:26.493 --> 14:28.290
Who is Charles Colson?

14:29.133 --> 14:32.125
The most powerful man in the
United States is President Nixon.

14:32.213 --> 14:33.566
You've heard of him?

14:35.573 --> 14:38.406
Charles Colson is Special
Counsel to the President.

14:38.733 --> 14:40.644
There's a cartoon on his wall.

14:41.253 --> 14:44.450
Caption reads, "When you've
got them by the balls...

14:44.613 --> 14:47.127
"their hearts and minds will follow".

14:53.893 --> 14:55.008
<i>Mullen & Company.</i>

14:55.093 --> 14:57.482
<i>- Howard Hunt, please.
- One moment, please.</i>

14:58.373 --> 14:59.806
<i>Howard Hunt here.</i>

15:01.013 --> 15:03.573
<i>Hi, I'm Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

15:03.653 --> 15:05.166
<i>Yes, what is it?</i>

15:05.653 --> 15:08.121
I was just kind of wondering
why your name and phone number...

15:08.213 --> 15:11.922
were in the address books of two
of the men arrested at Watergate?

15:12.013 --> 15:13.048
<i>Good God!</i>

15:14.213 --> 15:15.248
Do you care to comment?

15:15.333 --> 15:18.848
<i>In view that the matter is under
adjudication, I have no comment.</i>

15:20.013 --> 15:21.082
<i>Hello?</i>

15:21.173 --> 15:23.164
<i>This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

15:23.253 --> 15:26.211
I was told that you had
worked with a Mr. Howard Hunt.

15:26.533 --> 15:28.489
<i>Why would anyone say that?</i>

15:28.613 --> 15:30.205
You do know Mr. Hunt?

15:30.293 --> 15:33.808
<i>No, I don't believe so, and I can't
imagine why anyone would say that.</i>

15:33.893 --> 15:36.771
<i>Listen, I'm really sorry, but
I was on my way out. Goodbye.</i>

15:36.853 --> 15:39.765
<i>Could we just confirm a couple... Bye.</i>

15:42.813 --> 15:46.089
<i>- Did you say the Washington Post?
- Yes, that's right, the Post.</i>

15:46.173 --> 15:50.166
Your publishing firm was listed in some
papers in connection with a Howard Hunt.

15:50.253 --> 15:52.323
<i>Yeah, he's one of our authors.</i>

15:52.573 --> 15:54.370
<i>He wrote spy novels, I think.</i>

15:54.853 --> 15:58.163
What type of spy novels were they?
Were they modern, or were they period...

15:58.253 --> 16:00.721
You say, "wrote"? You mean
he's no longer with you anymore?

16:00.813 --> 16:01.962
<i>No, not at this time.</i>

16:02.053 --> 16:04.283
How long has it been since
you've heard from him?

16:04.373 --> 16:05.601
<i>A couple of years, I think.</i>

16:05.693 --> 16:08.605
Could you tell me some of the names
of the novels that he has written?

16:10.533 --> 16:13.411
<i>- Hello? Is this Mr. Paul Herrera?
- ¿Quién?</i>

16:13.733 --> 16:16.201
<i>This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

16:17.013 --> 16:19.732
<i>Bob Woodward of the...
Do you speak English?</i>

16:20.613 --> 16:22.922
<i>Momento, momento.</i>

16:23.013 --> 16:26.688
Do any of you guys speak English?
Do any of you guys speak Spanish?

16:30.293 --> 16:31.806
<i>- Señor.
- Sí.</i>

16:37.413 --> 16:39.404
Never mind. Thank you.

16:39.813 --> 16:41.132
Thank you. Never mind.

16:47.533 --> 16:49.091
<i>- Hello.
- Mr. Bennett?</i>

16:49.173 --> 16:50.526
<i>- Yes.
- This is Bob Woodward...</i>

16:50.613 --> 16:51.648
<i>of the Washington Post.</i>

16:51.733 --> 16:52.768
Sorry to bother you at home.

16:52.853 --> 16:54.764
I was wondering if you could
confirm some information...

16:54.853 --> 16:56.809
on one of your employees,
Mr. Howard Hunt?

16:56.893 --> 16:58.042
<i>What kind of information?</i>

16:58.133 --> 16:59.646
It's just profile information mostly.

16:59.733 --> 17:02.042
We know, for example, that he
works for Mullen & Company...

17:02.133 --> 17:05.887
or did work for Mullen & Company
as a writer. He's also a novelist.

17:05.973 --> 17:09.089
We know that he works in the office of
Mr. Charles Colson at the White House.

17:09.173 --> 17:10.288
<i>And the CIA.</i>

17:11.252 --> 17:12.606
And the CIA.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.965
<i>If you're conducting that
kind of investigation...</i>

17:16.093 --> 17:19.972
<i>then certainly it comes as no surprise
to you that Howard was with the CIA.</i>

17:20.053 --> 17:22.044
No, no surprise at all.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.522
Hunt worked for the CIA till 1970.

17:27.012 --> 17:28.924
From '49 to '70. Now, this
is on deep background...

17:29.013 --> 17:31.368
but the FBI thinks he's
involved with the break-in.

17:31.453 --> 17:32.522
What else you got?

17:32.613 --> 17:34.046
According to White House personnel...

17:34.133 --> 17:36.283
Hunt definitely worked there
as a consultant for Colson.

17:36.373 --> 17:39.729
That's Charles Colson, the
President's Special Counsel.

17:39.813 --> 17:41.371
Did you call the White
House Press Office?

17:41.453 --> 17:42.772
I went over there. I talked to them.

17:42.853 --> 17:45.287
They said Hunt hadn't worked
there for three months.

17:45.373 --> 17:47.933
Then a PR guy said
this weird thing to me.

17:49.573 --> 17:51.882
He said, "I'm convinced
that neither Mr. Colson...

17:51.973 --> 17:53.372
"nor anyone at the White House...

17:53.453 --> 17:55.728
"had any knowledge of
or participation in...

17:55.813 --> 17:59.328
"this deplorable incident at the
Democratic National Committee".

17:59.933 --> 18:03.050
- Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
- Absolutely.

18:03.893 --> 18:04.928
So?

18:05.453 --> 18:07.250
I never asked about Watergate.

18:08.133 --> 18:11.045
I simply asked what were Hunt's
duties at the White House.

18:11.453 --> 18:14.809
They volunteered he was innocent
when nobody asked if he was guilty.

18:16.973 --> 18:18.804
Be careful how you write it.

18:20.893 --> 18:23.453
Looks like we've got a White House
consultant linked to the bugging.

18:23.533 --> 18:25.808
Harry, this isn't a police
story anymore. This is national.

18:25.893 --> 18:27.531
We need a top political writer on it.

18:27.613 --> 18:29.205
Well, they don't want it.

18:29.453 --> 18:31.523
They're all over the goddamned
map covering the Primaries.

18:31.613 --> 18:33.331
Besides, this guy has busted his ass.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.563
He's been on this paper
for only nine months.

18:35.653 --> 18:37.769
- What's the matter with you?
- He's a humper!

18:37.893 --> 18:40.043
What's he been writing about,
rat shit in restaurants?

18:40.133 --> 18:42.522
- He's got no experience.
- He got a few of them closed, didn't he?

18:42.613 --> 18:44.171
Minor incidents. Small
government agencies.

18:44.253 --> 18:47.404
Have Mr. Moffitt come in here,
please. And see if Mr. Bradlee's free.

18:47.493 --> 18:48.642
I want Ben to hear this.

18:48.733 --> 18:50.644
Sure Moffitt'll want the
story for the National desk...

18:50.733 --> 18:52.166
now that we've built it into something.

18:52.253 --> 18:53.652
Even Bernstein's busting his ass!

18:53.733 --> 18:56.770
I read that cockamamie memorandum
he wrote on the break-in.

18:56.853 --> 18:59.083
All right, so some of it was bullshit.

18:59.173 --> 19:00.686
What is the matter with you?

19:00.773 --> 19:03.651
You told me yourself you were
going to fire him last month.

19:04.293 --> 19:07.842
Look, he wants on the
story bad. They both do!

19:08.973 --> 19:10.645
He knows a lot of people.

19:11.773 --> 19:13.411
Howard, they're hungry!

19:13.493 --> 19:15.085
You remember when you were hungry?

20:31.613 --> 20:33.285
<i>Hello. Can you get me Nigel...</i>

20:38.413 --> 20:39.732
Right away.

20:53.053 --> 20:54.725
- How's it going?
- What are you doing?

20:54.813 --> 20:56.166
- Polishing it a little.
- What?

20:56.253 --> 20:57.891
- Polishing it.
- What's wrong with it?

20:57.973 --> 20:59.565
Nothing. Nothing. It's good.

20:59.653 --> 21:00.847
Then what are you doing with it?

21:00.933 --> 21:03.493
I'm just helping. It's a little fuzzy.

21:03.773 --> 21:04.922
May I have it?

21:05.013 --> 21:06.571
I don't think you're
saying what you mean.

21:06.653 --> 21:08.006
I know exactly what I mean.

21:08.093 --> 21:09.685
Not here, I can't tell
from this whether...

21:09.773 --> 21:11.491
Hunt works for Colson
or Colson works for Hunt.

21:11.573 --> 21:13.404
- May I have it, please?
- Some of the conclusions...

21:13.493 --> 21:15.324
- May I have it?
- Yes. I'm not looking for a fight.

21:15.413 --> 21:16.687
I'm not looking for a fight, either.

21:16.773 --> 21:19.924
I'm just aware of the fact that
you've only been here nine months.

21:20.253 --> 21:21.527
What's that got to do with anything?

21:21.613 --> 21:22.966
I've been in the business since I'm 16.

21:23.053 --> 21:24.088
What are you saying?

21:24.173 --> 21:26.812
<i>I'm trying to tell you that if you'd
read mine and then read yours...</i>

21:26.893 --> 21:28.485
- May I read yours?
- Yeah.

21:29.293 --> 21:31.363
I walked by, gave yours a
glance, it didn't look right...

21:31.453 --> 21:32.966
so I just figured I'd
refine it a little.

21:33.053 --> 21:34.850
The first paragraph has
to have more clarity...

21:34.933 --> 21:36.332
if the reader's going to understand it.

21:36.413 --> 21:39.211
You don't mention Colson's
name till the third paragraph.

21:39.293 --> 21:41.204
I think mine's better. But
you go ahead and read it.

21:41.293 --> 21:43.363
If you think yours is better,
we'll give yours to the desk.

21:43.453 --> 21:45.409
I've got Colson's name up front.

21:46.573 --> 21:48.564
He's a White House consultant
and nobody knows it.

21:48.653 --> 21:50.052
You're right.

21:50.693 --> 21:52.206
Yours is better.

22:03.533 --> 22:05.444
If you're going to do it, do
it right. Here are my notes.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.489
If you're going to hype
it, hype it with the facts.

22:07.573 --> 22:10.451
I don't mind what you did.
I mind the way you did it.

22:11.853 --> 22:13.445
Woodward. Bernstein.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.842
You're both on the story.
Now don't fuck it up.

22:22.173 --> 22:25.210
Steuben, what's the name of that
girl that you bombed out with...

22:25.293 --> 22:27.682
- that works in Colson's office?
- Sharon Lyle.

22:29.453 --> 22:32.843
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- You're attractive.

22:34.453 --> 22:36.045
You are very attractive.

22:36.493 --> 22:38.927
You know, my girlfriend
told me to watch out for you.

22:39.013 --> 22:41.129
- Who?
- I'm not giving any names.

22:42.453 --> 22:44.523
Steuben said you worked for Colson.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.808
Steuben's crazy. I
never worked for Colson.

22:49.893 --> 22:51.121
That's what he said.

22:51.213 --> 22:55.092
I worked for an assistant. Colson
was really big on secrets, anyway.

22:55.733 --> 22:59.043
Even if I had worked for
him, I wouldn't know anything!

23:00.773 --> 23:04.288
Did you know Howard Hunt?
Didn't he work in the office?

23:04.373 --> 23:05.601
Yeah, I knew Howard.

23:05.693 --> 23:07.888
- Nice?
- He's a nice person.

23:08.173 --> 23:11.245
He's secretive, he is
secretive, but a decent man.

23:11.533 --> 23:14.093
Do you have any idea what he did?

23:15.533 --> 23:18.570
The White House said he was
doing some investigative work.

23:18.653 --> 23:19.881
What do you say?

23:21.653 --> 23:24.167
- He was doing investigative work.
- On what?

23:26.613 --> 23:28.490
- Different things.
- Like what?

23:30.453 --> 23:31.522
She warned me.

23:31.613 --> 23:34.173
I'm not going to take my
book out. I'm just asking you.

23:35.213 --> 23:38.683
The scuttlebutt for a while was
that he was investigating Kennedy.

23:38.773 --> 23:39.842
Go on.

23:40.173 --> 23:42.846
The White House was real
paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.

23:44.493 --> 23:47.690
I remember seeing a book about
Chappaquiddick on his desk.

23:47.773 --> 23:50.571
And he was always getting material
out of the White House Library...

23:50.653 --> 23:53.645
and the Library of Congress,
and anything he could find.

23:55.973 --> 23:57.452
<i>White House Library.</i>

23:57.533 --> 23:59.728
<i>Hi, this is Carl Bernstein
of the Washington Post...</i>

23:59.813 --> 24:01.849
and I was just wondering
if you can remember...

24:01.933 --> 24:05.721
any books that a Howard Hunt
checked out on Senator Kennedy?

24:05.813 --> 24:07.451
<i>- Howard Hunt?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

24:08.693 --> 24:11.446
<i>Yes, I think I do remember.</i>

24:11.773 --> 24:13.968
<i>He took out a whole lot of material.</i>

24:14.133 --> 24:17.808
<i>- Why don't you hold on and I'll see?
- I sure will. Thank you very much.</i>

24:30.453 --> 24:32.171
<i>- Mr. Bernstein?
- Yes, ma'am?</i>

24:32.853 --> 24:34.764
<i>- I was wrong.
- I beg your pardon?</i>

24:34.853 --> 24:39.210
<i>The truth is, I don't have a card
that says Mr. Hunt took any material.</i>

24:40.453 --> 24:42.569
<i>I don't remember getting material for...</i>

24:42.653 --> 24:45.565
<i>I do remember getting material for
somebody, but it wasn't for Mr. Hunt.</i>

24:45.653 --> 24:46.881
All right.

24:47.573 --> 24:51.248
<i>The truth is, I didn't have any
requests at all from Mr. Hunt.</i>

24:54.733 --> 24:57.372
<i>The truth is, I don't know any Mr. Hunt.</i>

25:02.093 --> 25:06.086
<i>I was just wondering if
you have any books... Hello?</i>

25:10.093 --> 25:12.653
Yes, we're checking
that information now.

25:12.733 --> 25:15.531
We'd just like to find out just
what it was that Hunt did...

25:15.613 --> 25:18.923
when he worked out as a White House
consultant on the Pentagon Papers.

25:19.013 --> 25:20.605
Yes, I'd appreciate that, if you could.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.604
Yes, sir. Thank you.

25:22.693 --> 25:24.649
I just got off the phone with
the White House librarian.

25:24.733 --> 25:26.883
You want to look at the notes on it?

25:28.373 --> 25:32.002
This is some stuff from the
Eisenhower campaign in 1952...

25:32.093 --> 25:34.243
that Hunt was connected with.

25:36.333 --> 25:38.324
Did you call the White
House Communications Office?

25:38.413 --> 25:40.688
No, I just got off the
phone with the librarian.

25:42.093 --> 25:43.924
- 524-743. - I
know the number.

25:46.093 --> 25:48.846
Between the first and second quote
there's a complete contradiction.

25:48.933 --> 25:50.412
It's a space of about five seconds.

25:50.493 --> 25:51.642
<i>- My feeling is...
- Was this all...</i>

25:51.733 --> 25:52.802
<i>Mr. Clawson's office.</i>

25:52.893 --> 25:54.565
<i>This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

25:54.653 --> 25:57.087
<i>- Could I talk to Mr. Clawson, please?
- One moment, please.</i>

25:57.173 --> 25:58.401
Thank you.

25:58.973 --> 26:00.804
When she came back she
said she didn't even know...

26:00.893 --> 26:03.248
<i>- Ken Clawson.
- Mr. Clawson, this is Bob Woodward.</i>

26:03.333 --> 26:05.767
<i>Carl Bernstein of the Washington
Post had a conversation...</i>

26:05.853 --> 26:07.286
with a White House librarian...

26:07.373 --> 26:10.683
on some books a Mr. Howard Hunt
took out on Senator Edward Kennedy.

26:10.773 --> 26:14.049
She first said that Howard Hunt had
taken out books on Senator Kennedy...

26:14.133 --> 26:16.283
and then she denied
even knowing who he was.

26:16.373 --> 26:19.092
I was wondering if you'd like
to comment on this confusion.

26:19.173 --> 26:21.323
<i>Listen, let me call
you back on this matter.</i>

26:21.413 --> 26:24.166
<i>- I'm going to check on it for you.
- All right, thank you. Bye.</i>

26:24.253 --> 26:25.481
- Call back?
- Yes.

26:25.573 --> 26:27.529
- This was all one conversation?
- Yeah.

26:27.613 --> 26:30.491
She says first of all, "I think
I got a bunch of books on Hunt".

26:30.573 --> 26:33.531
She comes back five seconds later, she says,
"I don't even know a Mr. Hunt".

26:33.613 --> 26:34.728
It's obvious someone got to her.

26:34.813 --> 26:37.168
Not enough proof. I mean, if
there was just a piece of paper...

26:37.253 --> 26:40.211
that said that Hunt was taking out
books on Kennedy and Chappaquiddick.

26:40.293 --> 26:41.931
<i>Like a... I don't know, library slip.</i>

26:42.013 --> 26:43.924
Hunt also took out books from
the Library of Congress...

26:44.013 --> 26:47.050
but what's more important is that
somebody got to her in that space of time.

26:47.133 --> 26:49.601
<i>- How do you know somebody got to her?
- Because she said that Hunt...</i>

26:49.693 --> 26:51.445
There was a lot of books
that Hunt checked out.

26:51.533 --> 26:53.444
And then she comes back
and she don't even know him.

26:53.533 --> 26:56.331
<i>- Woodward.
- Mr. Woodward, Ken Clawson calling back.</i>

26:56.413 --> 26:59.166
<i>- I've just talked with the librarian.
- Yes, sir.</i>

26:59.253 --> 27:03.326
<i>She denies that the conversation
with Mr. Bernstein ever took place.</i>

27:03.413 --> 27:05.688
<i>She said she referred
him to the Press Office.</i>

27:05.773 --> 27:07.729
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you
say she denies even knowing...

27:07.813 --> 27:09.451
about the conversation taking place?

27:09.533 --> 27:14.209
<i>That's right. She said someone did
call her asking about Mr. Hunt...</i>

27:14.293 --> 27:16.966
<i>but all she did was refer
him to the Press Office...</i>

27:17.053 --> 27:18.202
<i>and she denies that...</i>

27:18.293 --> 27:20.568
<i>- any other conversation took place.
- Total bullshit.</i>

27:20.653 --> 27:23.725
<i>- I hope that's been of some help to you.
- Thank you.</i>

27:27.293 --> 27:30.603
- We've got to get something on paper.
- The Library of Congress.

27:32.493 --> 27:33.528
Mona?

27:33.933 --> 27:36.322
Excuse me, Mona, could you
take any calls for me, please?

27:36.413 --> 27:38.005
- Sure.
- Here's my note.

27:38.933 --> 27:40.651
<i>If I get any calls...</i>

27:41.693 --> 27:44.161
- Will you be back later?
- I don't know when.

27:58.093 --> 28:01.130
You want all the material
requested by the White House?

28:01.653 --> 28:04.292
All White House transactions
are confidential.

28:05.373 --> 28:07.284
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

28:12.973 --> 28:16.443
- We need a sympathetic face.
- We're not going to find one here.

28:16.813 --> 28:18.804
You want every request since when?

28:19.373 --> 28:21.364
- When did he start?
- July of '71.

28:21.453 --> 28:23.364
I imagine the whole last year.

28:25.533 --> 28:28.172
I'm not sure you want
them, but I've got them.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.170
Maybe they pulled the cards.

29:23.253 --> 29:24.572
Maybe they changed the names.

29:24.653 --> 29:27.565
There might have been a
card there, and we missed it.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.286
Hey, wait a minute.

29:30.293 --> 29:33.126
I met a White House aide
once at a social occasion.

29:33.213 --> 29:35.488
- So?
- He might confirm.

29:37.613 --> 29:40.173
- Do we need W.H. In White House?
- Not in the second paragraph.

29:40.253 --> 29:42.244
- I don't think we do. Do we?
- White House will be enough.

29:42.333 --> 29:44.244
- White House.
- Just use White House. Forget the W.H.

29:44.333 --> 29:46.722
I want to know about Colson. What
was his job at the White House?

29:46.813 --> 29:49.691
- Special consultant to the President.
- I gotta say it.

29:51.213 --> 29:54.489
These notes on the White House
librarian, are they accurate?

29:55.853 --> 29:57.923
The White House librarian,
the notes, are they accurate?

29:58.013 --> 29:59.731
Yeah, but I wanna hear him say it.

30:19.933 --> 30:22.572
- Okay, let's have it.
- Here you are, Ben.

30:22.893 --> 30:25.361
It's a good, solid piece
of American journalism...

30:25.453 --> 30:27.921
<i>that the New York Times doesn't have.</i>

30:50.933 --> 30:52.048
You haven't got it.

30:52.133 --> 30:54.249
A librarian and a secretary
saying Hunt looked at a book.

30:54.333 --> 30:55.368
That's not good enough.

30:55.453 --> 30:58.570
A White House aide told me that
Hunt was investigating Kennedy.

30:58.653 --> 30:59.768
Who was it?

31:00.453 --> 31:02.409
Who was it? You want the name, you mean?

31:02.493 --> 31:04.324
No, how senior, how high up?

31:04.653 --> 31:06.132
I don't know titles.

31:19.653 --> 31:20.847
"Showed a special interest".

31:20.933 --> 31:23.163
No, we said the White House
was investigating Kennedy.

31:23.253 --> 31:24.891
"Showed a special interest in him".

31:24.973 --> 31:26.372
Jesus, the story's stronger than that.

31:26.453 --> 31:28.808
The White House librarian says
Hunt checked out a lot of books.

31:28.893 --> 31:31.487
<i>We got a secretary in Colson's
office said Hunt was sitting...</i>

31:31.573 --> 31:34.645
All right, Carl. Ben,
that's a Page 1 story.

31:36.013 --> 31:38.243
Stick it inside someplace.

31:39.373 --> 31:41.728
This is a goddamn important story.

31:47.013 --> 31:49.288
Get some harder information next time.

31:54.053 --> 31:56.931
Asshole. Bradlee's just
sticking up for the Kennedys.

31:57.013 --> 31:58.924
- We didn't have it, that's all.
- Bullshit. We had it cold.

31:59.013 --> 32:00.890
- No, we didn't.
- Why didn't you say something?

32:00.973 --> 32:04.409
Do you think bitching about it is
going to get the story where we want it?

32:05.533 --> 32:07.205
Throw it in the can.

32:37.213 --> 32:38.885
<i>- Yes?
- This is Woodward.</i>

32:41.253 --> 32:43.687
I want to talk about
Watergate. I know...

32:43.773 --> 32:46.241
<i>We're not going to
talk about that subject.</i>

32:48.053 --> 32:50.931
<i>- We talked about Wallace.
- But this is different.</i>

32:51.853 --> 32:55.050
That was about the shooting
of a man running for President.

32:55.773 --> 32:57.684
<i>- This is different.
- How?</i>

32:58.653 --> 33:01.406
<i>Not about this story.
Don't call me again.</i>

34:23.693 --> 34:25.603
Good luck, Mr. President.

34:51.933 --> 34:53.002
Taxi.

36:25.693 --> 36:27.684
- Where are you?
- Stuck.

36:28.613 --> 36:30.569
The story's stalled on us.

36:33.253 --> 36:35.209
And you thought I'd help?

36:38.093 --> 36:39.845
I'll never quote you.

36:41.653 --> 36:44.372
<i>I wouldn't quote you even
as an anonymous source:</i>

36:44.453 --> 36:46.523
You'd be on deep background.

36:49.853 --> 36:51.923
You can trust me. You know that.

36:54.893 --> 36:56.008
Go on.

36:59.013 --> 37:02.085
- Can you tell me what you know?
- You tell me what you know.

37:06.733 --> 37:09.452
Hunt worked for Colson
at the White House.

37:10.453 --> 37:13.331
Hunt was investigating
Kennedy at Chappaquiddick.

37:13.413 --> 37:15.449
That should tell you a lot.

37:15.533 --> 37:16.807
What else?

37:18.133 --> 37:22.092
We're beginning to hear a lot about
a lawyer at CREEP named Gordon Liddy...

37:22.773 --> 37:24.001
<i>who's...</i>

37:36.693 --> 37:38.172
Gordon Liddy...

37:38.613 --> 37:42.083
was fired by Mitchell because
he wouldn't talk to the FBI.

37:42.933 --> 37:45.401
- You'll hear more.
- Will he talk?

37:50.693 --> 37:52.763
I was at a party once, and...

37:52.853 --> 37:56.448
Liddy put his hand over a
candle, and he kept it there.

37:57.293 --> 38:00.763
He kept it right in the flame
until his flesh was burned.

38:02.573 --> 38:06.691
Somebody said, "What's the trick?"
And Liddy said, "The trick is not minding".

38:10.693 --> 38:12.251
The story is dry.

38:13.973 --> 38:16.248
All we've got are pieces.

38:16.333 --> 38:19.928
We can't seem to figure out what
the puzzle is supposed to look like.

38:20.013 --> 38:22.447
John Mitchell resigns
as the head of CREEP...

38:22.533 --> 38:25.252
and says that he wants to
spend more time with his family.

38:25.333 --> 38:28.086
Sounds like bullshit. We
don't exactly believe that.

38:28.173 --> 38:29.970
No, but it's touching.

38:33.013 --> 38:36.608
Forget the myths the media's
created about the White House.

38:37.613 --> 38:40.286
The truth is, these are
not very bright guys...

38:40.373 --> 38:42.364
and things got out of hand.

38:43.693 --> 38:45.809
Hunt's come in from the cold.

38:46.373 --> 38:50.730
Supposedly, he's got a lawyer
with $25,000 in a brown paper bag.

38:50.813 --> 38:52.371
Follow the money.

38:54.573 --> 38:57.770
What do you mean? Where?

38:57.853 --> 38:59.605
I can't tell you that.

39:00.013 --> 39:02.049
But you could tell me that.

39:02.573 --> 39:04.723
No, I have to do this my way.

39:05.013 --> 39:08.005
You tell me what you
know and I'll confirm.

39:08.573 --> 39:12.248
I'll keep you in the right
direction if I can, but that's all.

39:15.533 --> 39:17.524
Just follow the money.

39:28.053 --> 39:30.726
<i>- Goddamn New York Times.
- What is it?</i>

39:32.333 --> 39:35.962
Phone calls from burglars in
Miami to the Committee to Re-Elect.

39:39.253 --> 39:40.732
Fifteen phone calls.

39:40.813 --> 39:44.567
At least 15 phone calls and those phone
calls were made as early as March 15...

39:44.653 --> 39:46.530
which is a full three
months before the break-in.

39:46.613 --> 39:49.810
"$89,000 issued in the name
of a prominent Mexican lawyer".

39:49.893 --> 39:52.282
$89,000 in Mexican checks?

39:53.093 --> 39:54.924
Why didn't we get this?

39:55.653 --> 39:56.927
Who are their sources?

39:57.013 --> 40:00.130
I even know someone who
works at the phone company.

40:00.453 --> 40:02.842
Carl, if John Mitchell
wanted your phone records...

40:02.933 --> 40:05.163
you'd be running around
yelling invasion of privacy.

40:05.253 --> 40:06.732
<i>Was the New York Times article accurate?</i>

40:06.813 --> 40:09.452
- Yeah, but I can't get you a fuller listing.
- Why?

40:09.533 --> 40:11.808
They've subpoenaed all of
Bernard Barker's phone records.

40:11.893 --> 40:16.284
I think they're trying to find out if the
Watergate burglars broke any Florida law.

40:17.333 --> 40:19.483
- Who subpoenaed them?
- Miami DA.

40:19.573 --> 40:21.404
- What's his name?
- I don't know his name.

40:21.493 --> 40:24.326
But, the guy who's heading the
investigation is named Dardis.

40:24.413 --> 40:26.324
Dardis. What's his first name?

40:26.973 --> 40:30.522
I don't know his first name. I
guess you'll have to find that out.

40:37.373 --> 40:40.445
Hi. I'm Carl Bernstein, I have a
9:15 appointment with Mr. Dardis.

40:40.533 --> 40:42.808
Yes, Mr. Bernstein, I'm
afraid that Mr. Dardis...

40:42.893 --> 40:44.292
won't be able to see you this morning.

40:44.373 --> 40:45.692
His calendar is really quite full.

40:45.773 --> 40:48.287
There must be a mistake. I made
the appointment with him personally.

40:48.373 --> 40:50.841
- I called from Washington.
- It should've been made through me.

40:50.933 --> 40:53.208
If you care to wait, I'll see
if I can squeeze you in later.

40:53.293 --> 40:55.011
Oh, thanks very much.

40:56.253 --> 40:59.928
I guess it's difficult when
he makes his own appointments.

41:00.293 --> 41:02.523
Yes, well, we try to handle it.

41:10.773 --> 41:14.209
It's 4:00, we'll be back in
15 minutes. You want anything?

41:14.293 --> 41:16.124
- Coffee, black.
- Coffee, black.

41:21.493 --> 41:22.972
I'm still here.

41:23.373 --> 41:24.442
I'm so glad.

41:24.533 --> 41:27.491
If you could just get me in to see him
for five minutes, I'd appreciate it.

41:27.573 --> 41:30.212
- No, Mr. Bernstein.
- I have to get back.

41:30.373 --> 41:32.045
We're going to try.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.684
Oh, hi. He's expecting you.

41:42.213 --> 41:46.604
I do have a couple of things to do. I'll
be at the Sheraton if you want to reach me.

41:46.693 --> 41:49.730
If he has any space tomorrow, I'd
appreciate it. Number's on the back.

41:50.133 --> 41:51.930
- Fine.
- Thank you for your patience.

41:52.013 --> 41:55.164
Thank you, Mr. Bernstein.
Tomorrow it should be better.

41:55.253 --> 41:56.572
I guess so.

42:00.773 --> 42:02.126
<i>Mr. Dardis' office.</i>

42:02.213 --> 42:05.762
Hi. Please tell Mr. Dardis that
Mr. Bernstein has just left.

42:05.853 --> 42:07.923
He'll be available all day tomorrow.

42:08.013 --> 42:10.811
I think we can probably
squeeze him in around 4:30.

42:10.893 --> 42:11.962
<i>Yes.</i>

42:12.053 --> 42:15.966
And please tell Mr. Dardis that he doesn't
want to be late for his 6:30 appointment.

42:16.053 --> 42:17.725
<i>- Yes, I will.
- Thank you.</i>

42:25.453 --> 42:26.522
Mr. Dardis' office.

42:26.613 --> 42:28.922
<i>- This is Mr. Martinson over at the County...
- I beg your pardon?</i>

42:29.013 --> 42:30.605
<i>Martinson, over at the
County Clerk's office.</i>

42:30.693 --> 42:32.604
<i>There's some records here
that Dardis wanted right away.</i>

42:32.693 --> 42:34.684
<i>Could you come and get
them? We're closing.</i>

42:34.773 --> 42:36.604
Well, yes, I'll be right over.

43:00.853 --> 43:03.925
Could be easier, too.
All right. Hold it.

43:04.013 --> 43:05.969
- What?
- Excuse me.

43:06.053 --> 43:07.532
Hi. Can I help you in some way?

43:07.613 --> 43:09.410
I'm Carl Bernstein. I've
been waiting since 9:00.

43:09.493 --> 43:11.688
- Would you wait outside?
- I've been waiting out since morning.

43:11.773 --> 43:14.082
- Go ahead. Finish your call.
- Wait outside, please, will you?

43:14.173 --> 43:16.562
<i>No. I'm the reporter
from the Washington Post.</i>

43:16.653 --> 43:18.245
We talked on the telephone yesterday...

43:18.333 --> 43:20.244
and you told me to come
on down here and I'm here.

43:20.333 --> 43:23.211
Okay, yeah. I've got the press here.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

43:23.293 --> 43:25.249
If you didn't want to see me
I don't know why the hell...

43:25.333 --> 43:26.891
you didn't tell me when
I was in Washington?

43:26.973 --> 43:29.726
I just wasted a whole goddamned day
here. My paper's waiting for a story.

43:29.813 --> 43:32.452
You tell me yesterday to come here.
You said I got a 9:30 appointment.

43:32.533 --> 43:35.684
- I've been waiting out here the whole day.
- Caught me on the worst day possible.

43:35.773 --> 43:37.889
The man I work for has just
started a re-election campaign.

43:37.973 --> 43:40.282
Now, we're gonna have to see
each other tomorrow. Okay?

43:40.373 --> 43:43.012
No, sir, I'm facing a deadline and
my paper's saving a space for me.

43:43.093 --> 43:45.926
<i>- I just don't have a minute now.
- Well, I'm sorry...</i>

43:46.493 --> 43:49.212
Mr. Dardis, I'm really very
sorry about this. Mr. Bernstein...

43:49.293 --> 43:51.170
I beg your pardon, ma'am,
but this gentleman...

43:51.253 --> 43:52.845
made the appointment
with me specifically.

43:52.933 --> 43:55.128
<i>And I think the Washington Post
deserves the same courtesy...</i>

43:55.213 --> 43:57.408
as any of the people waiting
out there, with all due respect.

43:57.493 --> 43:59.643
I'll buzz you in about five minutes.

44:01.413 --> 44:03.324
The lady takes good care of me.

44:04.453 --> 44:07.013
The fact is we just can't
go into it this evening.

44:07.093 --> 44:08.845
It's going to have to
wait till tomorrow. Okay?

44:08.933 --> 44:10.844
I just wish you could've
told me that before I left...

44:10.933 --> 44:13.242
because I gotta go back to my
paper now and write that story...

44:13.333 --> 44:15.210
one way or another, that's all.

44:18.293 --> 44:21.888
Do you want to see Mr. Barker's
phone records and his money records?

44:21.973 --> 44:25.249
You told me on the phone if I'd come here
you'd show everything you got on Barker.

44:25.333 --> 44:27.801
- That's all I want.
- Well, that's what I've got.

44:27.893 --> 44:29.042
Well, that's fine.

44:29.133 --> 44:31.249
Okay, you and I are going to
have to have an agreement...

44:31.333 --> 44:34.689
that you're not going to reveal
the source of your information.

44:34.773 --> 44:39.130
All these are cashier's checks
on a bank in Mexico City.

44:39.213 --> 44:40.931
<i>- All these checks from Mexico?
- Sí.</i>

44:41.013 --> 44:43.004
How come? Did the money originate there?

44:43.093 --> 44:45.482
Well, I doubt it started off as pesos.

44:46.853 --> 44:48.445
Wait a minute, what's this one?

44:48.533 --> 44:50.683
<i>What's... Okay, $25,000.</i>

44:50.773 --> 44:52.843
- Who's that?
- Kenneth H. Dahlberg.

44:52.933 --> 44:55.049
We haven't been able to
ascertain who that is.

44:55.453 --> 44:57.444
Bob, listen, I think I got
something. I don't know what it is.

44:57.533 --> 44:59.649
But somewhere in this world
there's a Kenneth H. Dahlberg.

44:59.733 --> 45:01.883
<i>And we've got to get to him
before the New York Times does.</i>

45:01.973 --> 45:03.691
Because I think they
have the same information.

45:03.773 --> 45:05.206
Got a pencil? Write this down. Quick.

45:05.293 --> 45:08.729
Kenneth H. Dahlberg.
D-A-H-L-B-E-R-G.

45:10.093 --> 45:13.085
<i>McGovern, who at first had voiced
complete support for Eagleton...</i>

45:13.173 --> 45:15.050
<i>has more recently expressed doubts...</i>

45:15.133 --> 45:17.363
<i>and said that Eagleton
must make a decision...</i>

45:17.453 --> 45:19.728
<i>whether to stay or leave the ticket.</i>

45:20.933 --> 45:22.651
You're the one that
wanted the articles...

45:22.733 --> 45:24.291
- on Dahlberg, Kenneth H. Dahlberg?
- Yeah.

45:24.373 --> 45:26.204
Couldn't find anything
in the clip file at all.

45:26.293 --> 45:27.726
Oh, wonderful.

45:28.613 --> 45:31.571
I did find one picture
though, if it's any help.

45:33.893 --> 45:35.008
Thanks.

45:40.733 --> 45:42.052
Minnesota.

45:47.453 --> 45:48.772
<i>Minneapolis...</i>

46:04.373 --> 46:08.924
<i>I base that conclusion upon my
conversations with his doctors...</i>

46:09.853 --> 46:12.970
<i>and my close personal and
political association...</i>

46:13.413 --> 46:15.165
<i>- Outside line, please.
- Yes.</i>

46:15.453 --> 46:16.932
<i>- Thank you.
...the joint decision...</i>

46:17.013 --> 46:21.165
<i>that we have reached tonight,
health would not affect.</i>

46:21.613 --> 46:23.524
<i>But the public debate...</i>

46:23.893 --> 46:26.851
<i>over Senator Eagleton's
past medical history...</i>

46:27.373 --> 46:31.161
<i>continues to divert attention
from the great national issues...</i>

46:31.253 --> 46:33.244
<i>that need to be discussed.</i>

46:34.013 --> 46:37.562
<i>I have referred to the
growing pressures that ask...</i>

46:37.653 --> 46:39.962
<i>for Senator Eagleton's withdrawal.</i>

46:41.293 --> 46:42.408
<i>Hello?</i>

46:42.853 --> 46:44.923
<i>- Could I please... Mr. Dahlberg?
- Yes.</i>

46:45.013 --> 46:47.049
<i>- Kenneth Dahlberg?
- Yes.</i>

46:47.813 --> 46:50.611
<i>This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

46:51.813 --> 46:54.202
<i>- Yes?
- About that $25,000 check...</i>

46:54.293 --> 46:56.932
deposited in the bank account of
one of the Watergate burglars...

46:57.013 --> 46:58.810
<i>Mr. Bernard Barker...</i>

47:01.093 --> 47:04.085
As you know, sir, the
check has your name on it.

47:04.693 --> 47:06.251
We were doing a story on this...

47:06.333 --> 47:09.609
and I was wondering if you
would care to comment or explain?

47:09.933 --> 47:12.652
<i>I turn all my money
over to the Committee.</i>

47:13.093 --> 47:15.766
What committee is that, sir?
The Committee to Re-Elect?

47:15.853 --> 47:18.128
<i>- Yes.
- Why would you do that?</i>

47:19.253 --> 47:23.804
<i>I raise a lot of money. I'm
Midwest Finance Chairman.</i>

47:24.373 --> 47:26.523
For the Committee to Re-Elect?

47:27.013 --> 47:29.004
<i>- Hello?
- Yes, that's right.</i>

47:29.573 --> 47:33.407
How do you think your check got into the
bank account of the Watergate burglar?

47:33.493 --> 47:37.691
<i>I'm a proper citizen.
What I do is proper.</i>

47:38.413 --> 47:39.732
Oh, I understand.

47:39.813 --> 47:42.407
<i>I've just been through
a terrible ordeal.</i>

47:42.493 --> 47:44.768
<i>My neighbor's wife has been kidnapped.</i>

47:45.413 --> 47:48.962
How do you think your check
got into Barker's account list?

48:21.413 --> 48:24.450
<i>- Committee to Re-Elect the President.
- Could I speak to Mr. Clark MacGregor?</i>

48:24.533 --> 48:26.922
<i>- One moment, I'll connect you.
- Thank you.</i>

48:28.133 --> 48:29.202
<i>Yes?</i>

48:29.293 --> 48:30.442
<i>- Mr. MacGregor?
- Yes.</i>

48:30.533 --> 48:33.286
<i>This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

48:33.933 --> 48:35.366
<i>- Hello?
- Yes.</i>

48:35.453 --> 48:37.808
<i>This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

48:37.893 --> 48:39.963
I just spoke to a Mr.
Kenneth Dahlberg...

48:40.053 --> 48:41.725
who says that he is
Midwest Finance Chairman.

48:41.813 --> 48:43.769
<i>Yeah, I know Ken Dahlberg.</i>

48:44.173 --> 48:46.687
Well, I can't seem to get an
explanation on why a check...

48:46.773 --> 48:49.082
for $25,000 made out to Mr. Dahlberg...

48:49.173 --> 48:51.812
that he apparently sent to the
Committee to Re-Elect the President...

48:51.893 --> 48:53.884
would end up in the bank
account of a Watergate burglar.

48:53.973 --> 48:55.008
<i>I don't know.</i>

48:55.093 --> 48:57.561
<i>- But you're head of the Committee, sir.
- Look, I just came aboard.</i>

48:57.653 --> 48:59.769
<i>John Mitchell was the head of
the Committee. He might know.</i>

48:59.853 --> 49:01.525
Well, what would the
explanation possibly be...

49:01.613 --> 49:02.648
<i>I don't know.</i>

49:02.733 --> 49:04.530
<i>You're implying that I should know...</i>

49:04.613 --> 49:07.685
<i>and if you print that, our
relationship will be terminated.</i>

49:08.773 --> 49:10.206
Sir, we don't have a relationship.

49:10.293 --> 49:13.251
<i>The issues of the campaign
are peace and prosperity...</i>

49:13.333 --> 49:14.925
<i>not a campaign check.</i>

49:15.173 --> 49:17.289
<i>- Bob.
- Sir, no one is saying...</i>

49:17.373 --> 49:19.967
<i>...this happened before I came on board.
- Mr. Dahlberg is on line 2.</i>

49:20.053 --> 49:22.203
<i>I'm running a campaign for the
re-election of the President.</i>

49:22.293 --> 49:25.888
<i>We've raised $60 million and
you're asking about a $25,000 check.</i>

49:25.973 --> 49:28.612
Mr. MacGregor, excuse me, could
you hold one second, please?

49:28.693 --> 49:30.411
<i>- All right.
- Thank you. Yes?</i>

49:30.693 --> 49:32.046
<i>- Hello.
- Mr. Dahlberg?</i>

49:32.133 --> 49:33.612
<i>- Yes?
- Could you please hold one second, sir?</i>

49:33.693 --> 49:34.842
<i>- Yes.
- Thank you.</i>

49:34.933 --> 49:36.048
<i>- Mr. MacGregor?
- Yeah?</i>

49:36.133 --> 49:37.964
Can I call you right
back, sir? I'm very sorry.

49:38.053 --> 49:39.486
<i>- Yeah, okay.
- Mr. Dahlberg.</i>

49:39.573 --> 49:42.690
<i>Yes. I'm sorry I hung up before.</i>

49:42.773 --> 49:45.810
<i>I wasn't sure you were a
Washington Post reporter.</i>

49:45.893 --> 49:48.851
I believe we were talking
about a $25,000 check.

49:50.173 --> 49:52.733
<i>Obviously this is difficult for me.</i>

49:53.493 --> 49:56.291
<i>I'm caught in the middle
of something and...</i>

49:56.973 --> 49:58.531
<i>I don't know what.</i>

49:58.933 --> 50:01.083
What do you think it could be?

50:01.573 --> 50:03.564
<i>I deal with a lot of important people.</i>

50:03.653 --> 50:05.644
People who work for
the Committee? Hello?

50:05.733 --> 50:07.166
<i>For the Committee.</i>

50:07.253 --> 50:09.687
<i>- The Committee to Re-Elect
the President? - Yes.</i>

50:09.773 --> 50:12.446
<i>You see, I raised that money in cash...</i>

50:12.533 --> 50:14.967
<i>and I have a winter home in Florida.</i>

50:15.053 --> 50:18.045
<i>- Is that Miami?
- Boca Raton...</i>

50:18.453 --> 50:20.887
<i>and I didn't want to
carry all that cash around.</i>

50:20.973 --> 50:23.487
<i>- Now, you can understand that.
- Of course I can.</i>

50:23.573 --> 50:26.246
<i>So, I had it exchanged
for the cashier's check.</i>

50:26.333 --> 50:29.405
And how do you think it
got into Barker's account?

50:31.253 --> 50:33.972
<i>I know I shouldn't
be telling you this...</i>

50:36.413 --> 50:38.973
<i>I gave it to Mr. Stans.</i>

50:42.093 --> 50:43.492
I beg your pardon?

50:43.973 --> 50:45.725
<i>I gave it to Stans.</i>

50:45.813 --> 50:47.246
Maurice Stans?

50:47.733 --> 50:50.884
<i>- The head of finance for Nixon?
- Yes, in Washington.</i>

50:50.973 --> 50:54.522
<i>Now what he did with
it, I really do not know.</i>

50:54.853 --> 50:58.482
I see. Were there any other checks that
you might be aware of, that could...

50:58.573 --> 51:00.723
<i>That's all I have to say.</i>

51:01.813 --> 51:04.486
<i>Mr. MacGregor... Mr. Dahlberg...</i>

51:05.013 --> 51:06.969
I'm sorry. Thank you very much.

51:23.653 --> 51:24.722
- Bob?
- Yeah.

51:24.813 --> 51:27.486
- Carl Bernstein on line 1.
- One?

51:28.493 --> 51:29.528
<i>- Yeah?
- Woodward?</i>

51:29.613 --> 51:31.331
<i>- Bernstein.
- I think I got a lead on Dahlberg.</i>

51:31.413 --> 51:32.846
<i>- I just... I got it.
- What?</i>

51:32.933 --> 51:34.525
I just talked to him.
I just hung up from him.

51:34.613 --> 51:36.285
Bernstein, listen, it
goes all the way to Stans!

51:36.373 --> 51:38.364
<i>- What're you talking about?
- It goes all the way to Stans.</i>

51:38.453 --> 51:40.603
He gave the check to Stans
for the Committee to Re-Elect!

51:40.693 --> 51:43.571
<i>- Did he say that?
- He said it. I've got it in my notes.</i>

51:43.653 --> 51:45.245
<i>- Jesus.
- It's down on record, Bernstein.</i>

51:45.333 --> 51:47.972
<i>That money winds up in the bank
account of a Watergate burglar?</i>

51:48.053 --> 51:49.884
<i>- Yes!
- Fantastic. I'm coming home.</i>

51:49.973 --> 51:51.008
Okay.

51:52.573 --> 51:55.804
<i>... catapulted the unknown Senator from
Missouri into national prominence...</i>

51:55.893 --> 51:57.406
<i>by naming Eagleton as his running mate.</i>

52:02.213 --> 52:04.090
<i>... bolstering of support
for the Democratic ticket...</i>

52:04.493 --> 52:07.007
Scott, what happened with that Taiwan
thing you were telling us about?

52:07.093 --> 52:09.448
Japan is going to break
diplomatic ties with Taiwan...

52:09.533 --> 52:11.091
when they recognize Red China.

52:11.173 --> 52:13.846
The irony, of course, that's a direct
result of Nixon's visit to China.

52:13.933 --> 52:15.889
Jesus, what did he tell
them? What did he say to them?

52:15.973 --> 52:18.203
Incidentally, that's a
great parallel story...

52:18.293 --> 52:20.932
if you're going to do
that piece on détente.

52:21.333 --> 52:23.528
Right, "Queen Elizabeth
proclaims a state of emergency...

52:23.613 --> 52:25.683
"to deal with what we call
a 'dock strike' ".

52:25.773 --> 52:27.047
Breaking it off...

52:28.533 --> 52:30.171
I'll give you a human interest.

52:30.253 --> 52:32.164
"Thirty-one days of rain
in the Philippines...

52:32.253 --> 52:34.608
"is being blamed on the
theft of a statue of Jesus".

52:34.693 --> 52:36.445
We had one like that before.

52:38.493 --> 52:41.530
- I'll put my best writer on that.
- What about the one in India?

52:41.813 --> 52:44.646
Laugh, gentlemen, it'll be
the only story everyone reads.

52:44.733 --> 52:45.848
Okay, National?

52:45.933 --> 52:49.243
We have the Bremer diary.
"Wish to kill Nixon".

52:49.333 --> 52:52.803
He took a car trip to New York,
Ottawa, and Washington to kill him.

52:53.533 --> 52:56.411
We have the "Senate
approving the ABM Treaty".

52:56.733 --> 52:57.802
ABM.

52:57.893 --> 53:00.805
Of course, we have "McGovern
offering the VP spot..."

53:00.893 --> 53:02.326
to everybody.

53:02.413 --> 53:03.687
- Yeah, that's news.
- I have...

53:03.773 --> 53:05.092
Because everybody's been offered it.

53:05.173 --> 53:09.086
Now, I'll tell you what will be news.
When somebody accepts it. That's news.

53:09.373 --> 53:11.204
Here is some great art.

53:12.013 --> 53:15.767
McGovern and Humphrey at
breakfast, smiling their asses off.

53:15.853 --> 53:17.411
Isn't that great?

53:17.853 --> 53:21.209
- He says, "I am George's friend..."
- Why is that man smiling?

53:22.053 --> 53:23.645
Sounds friendly. Very friendly.

53:23.733 --> 53:26.486
"I'll be helping him in ways
he never dreamed possible".

53:26.573 --> 53:28.291
Breakfast followed by lunch.

53:30.293 --> 53:31.487
Okay. Metro?

53:31.573 --> 53:33.928
Well, we got the
schoolteachers on Capitol Hill.

53:34.013 --> 53:38.052
They want a 17% increase in pay
or this fall they go on strike.

53:38.133 --> 53:41.125
Harry, I think we could mention
that this might be the time...

53:41.213 --> 53:43.647
to go to the front page
on the district home rule.

53:43.733 --> 53:45.530
- Oh, come on!
- Listen to him.

53:45.613 --> 53:48.366
Ben, this time it could go all the way.

53:48.453 --> 53:51.331
The House is going to vote next
week on a Senate resolution.

53:51.413 --> 53:53.802
Okay then, well, when they
pass it, we'll run with it.

53:53.893 --> 53:56.202
Okay, fellas, let's go
around again now. Foreign?

53:56.733 --> 53:58.371
Taiwan emergency, Philippines.

53:58.453 --> 53:59.772
Okay, fine. National?

53:59.853 --> 54:01.366
I'll stand on the
Eagleton follow-ups...

54:01.453 --> 54:03.125
McGovern not being able
to get a replacement.

54:03.213 --> 54:05.966
He's offered it to Humphrey, Kennedy,
and Ribicoff. All turned him down.

54:06.053 --> 54:07.281
That's the Page 1 lead right there.

54:07.373 --> 54:10.012
You're ignoring the importance
of the Dahlberg repercussions.

54:10.093 --> 54:12.209
Nobody cares about the
Dahlberg repercussions.

54:12.293 --> 54:14.807
Now look, it was our story that
got the General Accounting Office...

54:14.893 --> 54:16.804
to start an audit with CREEP Finance.

54:16.893 --> 54:20.249
We printed that didn't we? When the
frigging audit's done, we'll print that, too.

54:20.333 --> 54:22.130
Let me tell you what happened today.

54:22.213 --> 54:24.681
I was having lunch at
the Sans Souci, and...

54:27.213 --> 54:29.204
this White House guy,
a good one, a pro...

54:29.293 --> 54:32.569
came up and asked me, "What is this
Watergate compulsion with you guys?"

54:32.653 --> 54:35.770
Compulsion? This is a story.
This is not compulsion.

54:36.053 --> 54:38.408
I said, "Well, we think it's important".
And he said:

54:38.493 --> 54:42.168
"If it's so goddamn important, who in
the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?"

54:42.253 --> 54:44.244
Now, what do you expect him
to say from the White House?

54:44.333 --> 54:45.607
"You're doing a great job"?

54:45.693 --> 54:48.082
Why don't you ask him
what he's really saying?

54:48.173 --> 54:50.448
He wants to take the story
away from Woodstein and...

54:50.533 --> 54:52.569
- give it to his National desk.
- At least I have...

54:52.653 --> 54:55.121
some experienced guys sitting
around who know the politicians...

54:55.213 --> 54:57.283
- who have the contacts.
- We're aware of that.

54:57.413 --> 54:59.051
You said it. Sitting around.

54:59.933 --> 55:02.447
Ben, it's a dangerous
story for this paper.

55:03.173 --> 55:06.290
- What if your boys get it wrong?
- Then it's our ass, isn't it?

55:06.373 --> 55:08.728
We all have to go out
and work for a living.

55:09.533 --> 55:11.444
National gets eight columns.

55:11.533 --> 55:13.091
Nine for Foreign.

55:13.533 --> 55:15.285
Metro, 15.

55:16.253 --> 55:17.686
That's it, fellas.

55:21.853 --> 55:23.923
Hey, Scott, I need to see you.

55:26.093 --> 55:27.082
How dangerous?

55:32.191 --> 55:35.945
Well, it's not just that we're using
unnamed sources that bothers me...

55:36.031 --> 55:39.307
or that everything we print,
the White House denies...

55:39.711 --> 55:42.828
or that almost no other papers
are reprinting our stuff.

55:42.911 --> 55:44.185
What then?

55:44.631 --> 55:46.986
Look, there are over 2,000
reporters in this town...

55:47.071 --> 55:49.107
are there five on Watergate?

55:49.871 --> 55:53.341
<i>Where did the Washington Post
suddenly get the monopoly on wisdom?</i>

55:54.471 --> 55:56.382
Why would the Republicans do it?

55:56.991 --> 56:01.064
McGovern is self-destructing, just like
Humphrey, Muskie, the bunch of them.

56:03.151 --> 56:04.903
I don't believe their story.

56:06.031 --> 56:07.828
It doesn't make sense.

56:09.911 --> 56:11.185
Yeah, Bernstein.

56:11.991 --> 56:13.504
Now? All right.

56:13.911 --> 56:16.345
Woodward, Bradlee will see us now.

56:16.431 --> 56:17.830
Answer the phone for me, will you?

56:17.911 --> 56:20.948
<i>Are you trying to find the lowest
possible common denominator...</i>

56:39.151 --> 56:40.550
Ben, it's the hottest item.

56:40.631 --> 56:42.189
- It's in over 500 papers.
- What is it?

56:42.271 --> 56:44.227
Yesterday's weather report
for people who were drunk...

56:44.311 --> 56:45.505
and slept all day.

56:45.591 --> 56:46.660
Jesus! Send it out...

56:46.751 --> 56:48.469
<i>to the San Francisco
Chronicle. They need it.</i>

56:48.551 --> 56:49.870
- How about the crossword puzzle?
- No.

56:49.951 --> 56:51.179
Anagrams?

56:51.871 --> 56:53.748
- No space, Mickey.
- Goodbye.

56:54.071 --> 56:56.426
The last thing you bought
from me was the obituaries.

56:56.511 --> 56:58.308
- Make him buy something, will you?
- All right.

56:58.391 --> 56:59.790
Hey, what do you guys want?

56:59.871 --> 57:02.749
The GAO report's due out the
morning of Nixon's renomination.

57:02.831 --> 57:04.105
Sit down.

57:04.591 --> 57:06.661
Well, that's two weeks from now.

57:07.391 --> 57:09.109
Since they're only
responsible to Congress...

57:09.191 --> 57:11.989
there's no way the White House
can control the investigation.

57:12.071 --> 57:14.301
There's a source over at General
Accounting that tells us...

57:14.391 --> 57:17.701
there's a whole rat's nest of
illegal shit going on over at CREEP.

57:17.791 --> 57:19.543
- Like what?
- Like a slush fund.

57:19.631 --> 57:22.191
Hundreds of thousands of
dollars of unaccounted-for cash.

57:22.271 --> 57:23.784
Hundreds of thousands of dollars?

57:23.871 --> 57:25.065
Any comment from CREEP?

57:25.151 --> 57:27.381
Yes. Unavailable for
comment. They're not talking.

57:27.471 --> 57:30.781
But what else besides the
money? Where's the goddamn story?

57:32.631 --> 57:34.508
The money's the key to whatever this is.

57:34.591 --> 57:36.070
- Says who?
- Deep Throat.

57:36.151 --> 57:38.267
- Who?
- Oh, that's Woodward's garage freak...

57:38.351 --> 57:39.909
his source in the executive...

57:39.991 --> 57:43.586
Garage freak? Jesus, what kind
of a crazy, fucking story is this?

57:44.191 --> 57:45.544
Who did you say?

57:47.791 --> 57:51.147
He's on deep background.
I call him "Deep Throat".

57:52.311 --> 57:54.188
Look, McGovern's dropped to nothing...

57:54.271 --> 57:56.102
Nixon's guaranteed the renomination...

57:56.191 --> 57:58.147
<i>and the Post is stuck with
a story no one else wants.</i>

57:58.231 --> 57:59.744
It'll sink the goddamn paper.

57:59.831 --> 58:02.186
Everyone says, "Get off it, Ben".
And I come on very sage...

58:02.271 --> 58:04.990
and I say, "You'll see.
You wait till this bottoms out".

58:05.071 --> 58:08.222
But the truth is, I can't
figure out what we've got.

58:10.791 --> 58:12.349
What else are you working on?

58:12.431 --> 58:14.308
We're after a list of CREEP employees.

58:14.391 --> 58:16.507
- Where is it?
- It's classified.

58:16.711 --> 58:19.703
- How are you gonna get it?
- We haven't had any luck, yet.

58:20.071 --> 58:21.220
Get some.

58:26.351 --> 58:27.625
Anything else?

58:37.191 --> 58:39.227
You made a mistake in there.

58:42.671 --> 58:43.740
What?

58:44.031 --> 58:45.987
You said to Brad that we
haven't had any luck yet...

58:46.071 --> 58:48.631
and that's the thing that he jumps
on. You can't talk about luck.

58:48.711 --> 58:52.260
If you can't talk in specifics,
you shouldn't say anything.

58:57.231 --> 58:59.062
Is there any place you don't smoke?

59:01.831 --> 59:03.310
- What?
- Hold it.

59:03.671 --> 59:05.741
- What're you doing?
- Kay Eddy.

59:05.831 --> 59:08.743
Doesn't she go with a guy that
works for the Committee to Re-Elect?

59:09.151 --> 59:10.584
<i>- The E.R.
- All right.</i>

59:10.671 --> 59:12.821
- Eddy? Hey. Kay, can...
- Just a second.

59:13.391 --> 59:17.100
<i>- 757-6521. - Okay, I'll get
back to you on this, thanks.</i>

59:18.151 --> 59:21.587
Don't you go with a guy that works
for the Committee to Re-Elect?

59:22.391 --> 59:24.268
- Not anymore.
- You did go with him, though.

59:24.351 --> 59:26.103
I think you were engaged
to him, weren't you?

59:26.191 --> 59:28.182
- Yeah.
- You got out of it?

59:29.591 --> 59:31.786
- So?
- You're looking better.

59:34.591 --> 59:36.582
Look, we need a list of
the people that work there.

59:36.671 --> 59:38.309
<i>Do you think that...</i>

59:38.391 --> 59:40.382
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

59:41.391 --> 59:42.585
It's personal.

59:42.671 --> 59:45.026
What do you mean? You said it was over.

59:47.631 --> 59:50.099
You're asking me to
use a guy I care about.

59:50.191 --> 59:52.785
- No. We're not asking you to use him...
- Well, sure...

59:52.871 --> 59:55.260
...just to help us. I mean,
we'd do the same for you.

59:55.351 --> 59:57.467
My only chance of getting
that story is if I see him.

59:57.551 --> 59:59.303
I don't want to see him again.

59:59.391 --> 01:00:01.621
- Do you have to see him?
- Sure, I have to see him.

01:00:01.711 --> 01:00:02.985
No. Do you have to see him that way?

01:00:03.071 --> 01:00:04.743
Can't you just call him
up on the telephone...

01:00:04.831 --> 01:00:06.981
and say you want to have a drink
with him, just feel him out?

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:10.666
You say the relationship is over.
What the hell do you have to lose?

01:00:11.511 --> 01:00:12.785
Forget it.

01:00:13.391 --> 01:00:15.666
We don't want you to do anything
that would embarrass you...

01:00:15.751 --> 01:00:18.140
or that you don't feel right about.

01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:20.105
Forget it.

01:00:28.431 --> 01:00:31.309
Don't let her just get off. I think
she was going to say something.

01:00:31.391 --> 01:00:33.905
You just overdramatized it, she
was going to give us what we want.

01:00:33.991 --> 01:00:35.026
It's over.

01:00:35.111 --> 01:00:36.464
- What?
- It's over.

01:01:19.631 --> 01:01:20.984
Is this the whole list?

01:01:21.071 --> 01:01:24.586
Look what it says. "Personnel,
Committee to Re-Elect the President".

01:01:26.511 --> 01:01:29.071
This is all in alphabetical order.
You can't tell who works for who.

01:01:29.151 --> 01:01:32.109
Well, find out the department heads
like Mitchell, Magruder, Stans.

01:01:32.191 --> 01:01:33.385
Here. John Mitchell.

01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:34.950
- What's the number?
- 301.

01:01:35.031 --> 01:01:37.499
All right. Find somebody
who has a number close to it.

01:01:37.591 --> 01:01:39.149
- They probably work for him.
- There's a 303.

01:01:39.231 --> 01:01:40.300
Okay.

01:01:42.511 --> 01:01:46.026
<i>Okay, we have to find out how the money
got from Maurice Stans to the burglars.</i>

01:01:46.111 --> 01:01:48.067
<i>Somebody who worked in Finance.</i>

01:01:48.751 --> 01:01:51.629
<i>All right. Here's the head of
Finance. Maurice Stans, 269.</i>

01:01:51.711 --> 01:01:54.509
<i>If we can just get somebody
who works under Stans.</i>

01:01:55.271 --> 01:01:57.227
<i>- Sloan? You need him?
- He's the treasurer.</i>

01:01:57.311 --> 01:01:59.267
<i>- What's the number?
- Hugh Sloan, 287.</i>

01:01:59.351 --> 01:02:01.069
<i>Is there a secretary?</i>

01:02:02.751 --> 01:02:05.709
<i>Wait a minute. Manley.
Here it is. Irene Manley?</i>

01:02:06.511 --> 01:02:08.866
<i>1406 Lee Jackson Memorial Highway.</i>

01:02:09.231 --> 01:02:11.381
- Hi, I'm Bob Woodward.
- I'm Carl Bernstein.

01:02:11.471 --> 01:02:12.540
<i>We're from the Washington Post.</i>

01:02:12.631 --> 01:02:14.826
We'd like to know if we could
speak to you for a few minutes.

01:02:14.911 --> 01:02:17.300
We understand your daughter works
for the Committee to Re-Elect.

01:02:17.391 --> 01:02:20.383
- Wouldn't be anything embarrassing.
- Would you object to just...

01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:23.506
- Yes?
- Hi.

01:02:23.591 --> 01:02:24.944
Miss Milland? Betty Milland?

01:02:25.031 --> 01:02:26.749
- I'm Bob Woodward.
- Carl Bernstein.

01:02:26.831 --> 01:02:28.105
<i>We're from the Washington Post.</i>

01:02:28.191 --> 01:02:30.830
<i>I know you're trying to
do your job. I mean...</i>

01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:33.427
You don't understand the
pressure that we're under.

01:02:33.511 --> 01:02:36.548
It'll just take a couple of seconds. If
we can just come in for a couple of...

01:02:36.631 --> 01:02:38.349
- No, I really don't...
- We don't want to come in.

01:02:38.431 --> 01:02:40.183
We understand that there
was some documents...

01:02:40.271 --> 01:02:42.023
that were shredded at the Committee.

01:02:42.111 --> 01:02:43.464
<i>Well, there...</i>

01:02:43.671 --> 01:02:46.060
There's often shredding.
We do that a lot.

01:02:46.151 --> 01:02:48.346
- Were you there during the shredding?
- Yes, I was.

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:50.945
I see. Were there any
department heads from...

01:02:51.031 --> 01:02:52.669
the Committee who were also present?

01:02:52.751 --> 01:02:55.219
Yes. Mr. Mitchell came in one night.

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:57.541
John Mitchell? The Attorney General?

01:02:57.991 --> 01:03:00.824
He was carrying a
raincoat over his head.

01:03:01.871 --> 01:03:04.101
<i>I thought he was going to go...</i>

01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:06.349
Did he supervise the shredding?

01:03:06.431 --> 01:03:09.901
<i>Can I not answer any more
questions? I'd just soon not...</i>

01:03:10.031 --> 01:03:11.942
Okay? Maybe I could call you?

01:03:13.151 --> 01:03:16.268
- Are you being told not to talk?
- Will you call us?

01:03:16.831 --> 01:03:18.230
I don't know.

01:03:18.631 --> 01:03:19.780
I'll try.

01:03:19.871 --> 01:03:22.260
What about all that shredding
that took place after the break-in?

01:03:22.351 --> 01:03:24.262
Need to know more about the
papers that were in shredding.

01:03:24.351 --> 01:03:25.909
I think you've some idea
what's in the papers...

01:03:25.991 --> 01:03:27.788
when the former Attorney
General comes to the office...

01:03:27.871 --> 01:03:29.509
when it's taking place at
the Committee to Re-Elect...

01:03:29.591 --> 01:03:31.468
and got a raincoat over his
head. Why's he in a raincoat?

01:03:31.551 --> 01:03:32.904
Could be raining is
what could've happened.

01:03:32.991 --> 01:03:34.140
Let me go through the story again.

01:03:34.231 --> 01:03:36.461
You got a woman who's frightened
at the door. Works for CREEP.

01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:39.543
She said there's shredding taking place.
We don't know what's in the papers.

01:03:39.631 --> 01:03:42.589
We know the former Attorney General
comes in with an overcoat over his head.

01:03:42.671 --> 01:03:44.309
It could be raining.
There's a lawyer present.

01:03:44.391 --> 01:03:46.541
We don't know what he asked
them. She wouldn't talk about it.

01:03:46.631 --> 01:03:48.349
Now, will you please tell
me where there's a story?

01:03:48.431 --> 01:03:51.548
There's a story in the fact that the
interview did not take place in her home...

01:03:51.631 --> 01:03:53.189
but in the office of the
Committee to Re-Elect.

01:03:53.271 --> 01:03:54.750
How's there a story in
that? It's not enough!

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.742
There's a story because
there's a lawyer in the office.

01:03:56.831 --> 01:03:58.822
- I mean, you're more resistant than she is.
- That's right.

01:03:58.911 --> 01:04:00.788
- Why?
- Because there's not enough fact.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:04.743
<i>Well, let's just turn around and
go back and question her again.</i>

01:04:06.671 --> 01:04:09.390
- This won't take long at all. We just want...
- Please go away, okay?

01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:11.826
Will you please leave
before they see you.

01:04:12.311 --> 01:04:14.950
- Who did you mean by...
- Who do you mean, "they"?

01:04:15.271 --> 01:04:16.909
Could you give us their names?

01:04:16.991 --> 01:04:20.347
We haven't revealed the sources
of people that have talked to us.

01:04:21.271 --> 01:04:23.307
You know, I really can't
talk about this because...

01:04:23.391 --> 01:04:25.666
Would "they" be members
of the Committee?

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:30.103
<i>Someone got to that woman.</i>

01:04:30.191 --> 01:04:31.670
<i>It's the key to the whole cover-up.</i>

01:04:31.751 --> 01:04:33.343
<i>How can you write that
there's a cover-up?</i>

01:04:33.431 --> 01:04:34.830
<i>We don't know that there's a cover-up!</i>

01:04:34.911 --> 01:04:36.742
Well, then, I don't know
what the hell you need.

01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:38.947
So, you tell me what you need.

01:04:39.391 --> 01:04:41.222
I need more fact for a
story is what I need...

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:42.869
and I think you should
need the same thing.

01:04:42.951 --> 01:04:44.669
Okay, if you get in the car...

01:04:44.751 --> 01:04:47.311
and there's music playing
in the car, hypothetically.

01:04:47.391 --> 01:04:49.302
There's music playing in
the car for 10 minutes...

01:04:49.391 --> 01:04:51.859
and there's no commercial.
What can you deduce from that?

01:04:51.951 --> 01:04:53.384
- Is it AM or FM?
- Come on, Bernstein!

01:04:53.471 --> 01:04:54.665
Is it AM or FM?

01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:58.346
A guy can come up to me on the
street and he can ask me an address.

01:04:58.631 --> 01:05:01.429
Now, is the man interrogating
me, or is he lost?

01:05:01.511 --> 01:05:02.830
What kind of a story do I write?

01:05:02.911 --> 01:05:04.742
What kind of a deduction
do I make from that?

01:05:04.831 --> 01:05:07.982
Because you don't have a gut feeling
that the woman is trying to help us?

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.824
No, I don't have enough gut
feeling and I wish I did.

01:05:11.791 --> 01:05:14.100
<i>We're from the Washington Post...</i>

01:05:18.151 --> 01:05:21.063
<i>Abbott, Addis, Agusto, Albus...</i>

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:31.705
<i>Is there something that
strikes you as odd about this?</i>

01:05:31.791 --> 01:05:33.543
<i>- What?
- It's almost like there's a pattern...</i>

01:05:33.631 --> 01:05:34.666
<i>to the way they're not talking.</i>

01:05:34.751 --> 01:05:37.788
<i>The way they say "no"all
the time. I think it's odd.</i>

01:05:38.231 --> 01:05:39.903
- Mrs. Hambling?
- Yes.

01:05:40.111 --> 01:05:42.341
<i>Hi, we're from the Washington Post.</i>

01:05:42.431 --> 01:05:44.342
I'm Carl Bernstein,
this is Bob Woodward.

01:05:44.431 --> 01:05:47.343
A friend of the Committee
said that we could contact you.

01:05:47.431 --> 01:05:49.387
- Who was it?
- We can't reveal that.

01:05:49.471 --> 01:05:51.780
You can talk to us. We
don't reveal our sources.

01:05:51.871 --> 01:05:53.350
<i>You people...</i>

01:05:54.311 --> 01:05:57.542
You think you can come into
my home, ask a few questions...

01:05:58.111 --> 01:06:02.423
have me destroy the reputations
of men that I work for and respect?

01:06:04.031 --> 01:06:05.987
Do you understand loyalty?

01:06:06.351 --> 01:06:08.307
Have you ever heard of loyalty?

01:06:09.591 --> 01:06:10.785
- Hi.
- Yes?

01:06:10.991 --> 01:06:12.026
I'm Bob Woodward.

01:06:12.111 --> 01:06:13.908
<i>Carl Bernstein. We're
from the Washington Post.</i>

01:06:13.991 --> 01:06:15.060
Yes.

01:06:15.151 --> 01:06:17.870
I've read what you've
written. I want to thank you.

01:06:18.751 --> 01:06:22.027
I've been a Republican all my life,
but this goes beyond party politics.

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:24.579
Would you mind if we
asked you a few questions?

01:06:24.671 --> 01:06:27.105
No. Come in. Would you like coffee?

01:06:28.111 --> 01:06:29.180
Sure.

01:06:29.591 --> 01:06:32.264
What they've done is a
threat to the Constitution.

01:06:32.351 --> 01:06:34.581
It goes against everything we stand for.

01:06:34.671 --> 01:06:37.344
Could you be a little bit
more specific than that?

01:06:37.431 --> 01:06:40.104
I'm afraid your articles have
just scratched the surface.

01:06:40.191 --> 01:06:42.910
You don't mind if I just
take a few notes, do you?

01:06:42.991 --> 01:06:44.026
No.

01:06:44.991 --> 01:06:47.300
How long have you
worked at the Committee?

01:06:47.631 --> 01:06:48.700
Committee?

01:06:48.791 --> 01:06:51.589
Yes, the Committee to
Re-Elect the President.

01:06:52.991 --> 01:06:56.540
Oh, I don't work at the Committee
to Re-Elect the President.

01:06:56.751 --> 01:07:00.221
I work at Garfinkel's, in
the accounting department.

01:07:04.191 --> 01:07:05.863
- Miss Abbott?
- Yes.

01:07:07.551 --> 01:07:08.984
Judith Abbott?

01:07:11.271 --> 01:07:12.750
Carolyn Abbott.

01:07:15.511 --> 01:07:17.820
We're just doing something wrong.

01:07:20.351 --> 01:07:22.182
- Never been there.
- No.

01:07:23.231 --> 01:07:25.267
We're doing something wrong.

01:07:25.871 --> 01:07:27.827
It's just not good enough.

01:07:28.191 --> 01:07:31.308
How can you keep going at something
past the point when you believe it?

01:07:31.391 --> 01:07:33.427
We just have to start all over again.

01:07:39.111 --> 01:07:41.864
<i>Nasmith, Narrow, Ness...</i>

01:07:42.031 --> 01:07:43.544
<i>Nickels, Nixon...</i>

01:07:44.151 --> 01:07:45.470
<i>Ed Nixon.</i>

01:07:46.031 --> 01:07:48.465
<i>Jolson, Jones...</i>

01:07:49.071 --> 01:07:50.982
<i>Jordan, Jost.</i>

01:07:51.111 --> 01:07:53.545
<i>If we could only get somebody
that worked for Finance to talk.</i>

01:07:53.631 --> 01:07:54.700
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:56.349
<i>- What about the bookkeeper?
- Which bookkeeper?</i>

01:07:56.431 --> 01:07:58.228
<i>The bookkeeper that worked
for both Slans and...</i>

01:07:58.311 --> 01:08:00.267
<i>- Oh, you're all right.
- Sloan and Stans.</i>

01:08:00.351 --> 01:08:03.149
<i>I've been there. I've called
her twice. There's no answer.</i>

01:08:03.231 --> 01:08:05.028
<i>I say we should start again.</i>

01:08:05.871 --> 01:08:08.669
<i>Abbott, Addis, Agusto...</i>

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:12.266
<i>Albus, Aldus, Alexander...</i>

<i>Skroes, Skully...</i>

01:08:31.791 --> 01:08:33.747
<i>Skully. We've been there twice.</i>

01:08:33.831 --> 01:08:37.665
<i>All right, Willcox, Windfall, Winter...</i>

01:08:38.991 --> 01:08:42.028
Two weeks work, half the names
crossed off and what've you got?

01:08:42.111 --> 01:08:43.669
People aren't talking, Harry.

01:08:43.751 --> 01:08:46.424
And it's the way they're
not talking that's unnatural.

01:08:46.671 --> 01:08:49.549
Harry, we've been up all night. We
went over all the quotes of the people.

01:08:49.631 --> 01:08:52.270
- Slamming doors in our faces.
- It's like they're getting instructions.

01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:54.103
Want to hear some real news?

01:08:54.751 --> 01:08:56.946
That GAO report in which
you placed so much faith...

01:08:57.031 --> 01:08:59.499
well, it's been postponed till
after tonight's renomination.

01:08:59.591 --> 01:09:02.185
- What do you mean?
- Hughes got a call from Stans in Florida.

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:04.580
Says he has new information,
not to republish without it.

01:09:04.671 --> 01:09:07.231
They're going to bury the report
until after the renomination.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:10.064
The Grand Jury indictment will be
out soon and every indication says...

01:09:10.151 --> 01:09:13.063
the indictment will stop at the
five burglars, Hunt and Liddy.

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:15.501
And that's the end of your story.

01:09:19.991 --> 01:09:23.142
<i>The vote of all the
delegates has been recorded.</i>

01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:28.582
<i>The vote for Richard Nixon...</i>

01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:33.582
<i>is 1,347.</i>

01:09:34.831 --> 01:09:38.107
<i>The vote for Paul McCloskey is one.</i>

01:09:42.631 --> 01:09:44.826
<i>And therefore I declare the
nominee of the Republican Party...</i>

01:09:46.511 --> 01:09:49.024
<i>for President of the United States...</i>

01:09:49.751 --> 01:09:51.901
<i>President Richard Nixon.</i>

01:09:58.991 --> 01:10:01.903
<i>Four more years!</i>

01:10:18.151 --> 01:10:22.861
<i>The President, and the future President
of the United States of America!</i>

01:10:24.431 --> 01:10:26.661
<i>Wonderful young faces I see out there.</i>

01:10:26.751 --> 01:10:30.426
<i>Your enthusiasm, your
idealism, your hard work.</i>

01:10:32.791 --> 01:10:35.146
<i>This is your first vote,
and years from now...</i>

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:37.222
<i>I just hope you can all look back...</i>

01:10:37.311 --> 01:10:40.303
<i>and say it was one of
your best votes. Thank you.</i>

01:11:03.951 --> 01:11:06.590
<i>Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein of
the Washington Post and...</i>

01:11:06.671 --> 01:11:08.946
I just want to ask you
a couple of questions.

01:11:09.031 --> 01:11:11.067
Well, you don't want
me. You want my sister.

01:11:11.151 --> 01:11:13.381
It's for you. It's Carl Bernstein.

01:11:13.471 --> 01:11:15.427
<i>Oh, my God. He's the guy
from the Post. Get rid of him.</i>

01:11:15.511 --> 01:11:17.388
Could I just borrow one
of your cigarettes there?

01:11:17.471 --> 01:11:18.540
Sure.

01:11:19.991 --> 01:11:21.265
You've really got to go.

01:11:21.351 --> 01:11:23.421
Sure. Could I just get a match?

01:11:24.711 --> 01:11:26.110
I can understand your being afraid.

01:11:26.191 --> 01:11:28.182
There's a lot of people at
the Committee just like you...

01:11:28.271 --> 01:11:31.468
who wanted to tell the truth
but some people wouldn't listen.

01:11:31.911 --> 01:11:35.028
Certain people have gone back
to the prosecutors and the FBI...

01:11:35.111 --> 01:11:37.830
to give information which
they were never asked.

01:11:39.471 --> 01:11:43.066
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when
he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance...

01:11:43.151 --> 01:11:45.540
and we were just
wondering if you were...

01:11:45.871 --> 01:11:49.420
promoted to work for Mr. Stans
immediately after Mr. Sloan quit...

01:11:49.511 --> 01:11:51.979
or whether there was some time lapse?

01:11:55.791 --> 01:11:58.100
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.

01:12:00.471 --> 01:12:03.429
Can I get you some coffee or something?

01:12:03.551 --> 01:12:05.382
Yeah. Thanks very much.

01:12:09.711 --> 01:12:10.939
Door sticks.

01:12:14.671 --> 01:12:17.026
Could I just sit down for a second?

01:12:19.831 --> 01:12:23.141
Sure, you can sit down, but I'm
not going to tell you anything.

01:12:24.431 --> 01:12:25.500
Okay.

01:12:46.351 --> 01:12:48.740
I was just curious
why you lied just then.

01:12:49.271 --> 01:12:52.229
Have you been threatened
if you tell the truth?

01:12:53.231 --> 01:12:54.266
No.

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:57.109
Never in so many words.

01:12:57.831 --> 01:12:59.025
- How do you like it?
- Just milk.

01:12:59.111 --> 01:13:00.829
- Thanks.
- Okay, I'll just get that.

01:13:01.351 --> 01:13:05.230
I saw in the wires that Mrs.
Stans was in the hospital.

01:13:05.311 --> 01:13:07.108
Is she feeling better?

01:13:11.951 --> 01:13:15.068
The GAO, the General
Accounting Report said that...

01:13:15.911 --> 01:13:20.348
there was $350,000 in the safe of the
Committee to Re-Elect the President.

01:13:21.351 --> 01:13:24.946
Were you aware that it was that kind
of funds from the very beginning?

01:13:29.151 --> 01:13:32.109
A lot of people are watching
me. They know I know a lot.

01:13:32.671 --> 01:13:34.343
Was it all in $100 bills?

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:36.230
A lot of it was.

01:13:37.511 --> 01:13:40.105
I thought it was an
all-purpose, political fund...

01:13:40.191 --> 01:13:43.069
you know, for taking fat cats
to dinner, things like that.

01:13:43.151 --> 01:13:45.028
$350,000 for dinners?

01:13:47.671 --> 01:13:49.263
How was it paid out?

01:13:53.751 --> 01:13:55.264
Not in one big chunk.

01:13:57.311 --> 01:13:59.779
There was a list of 15 names
and the amount of money...

01:13:59.871 --> 01:14:02.066
given to each person next to the name.

01:14:02.751 --> 01:14:04.548
What happened to the list?

01:14:06.431 --> 01:14:09.264
It was destroyed. It
was the only record.

01:14:11.231 --> 01:14:14.143
Don't pay attention to
this. This is for my memory.

01:14:16.711 --> 01:14:18.622
I have a very bad memory.

01:14:19.791 --> 01:14:21.509
You won't be quoted by name.

01:14:21.591 --> 01:14:24.628
In fact, we get confirmations
before we print anything.

01:14:24.711 --> 01:14:26.110
I can't be...

01:14:26.431 --> 01:14:29.309
positive that that money was used
for the break-in, you understand?

01:14:29.391 --> 01:14:30.665
Yes, I do.

01:14:31.071 --> 01:14:33.869
- But, people sure are worried.
- Which people?

01:14:40.351 --> 01:14:44.185
Think you could help me with
the disbursement of money...

01:14:44.271 --> 01:14:47.866
in terms of the number of people
that were involved? How many?

01:14:50.471 --> 01:14:53.110
A group of them. About five.
I don't know their names.

01:14:53.191 --> 01:14:55.625
Would Mr. Sloan know?

01:15:00.391 --> 01:15:03.303
- Would he...
- I don't want to say anymore, okay?

01:15:12.391 --> 01:15:14.029
I won't be much longer.

01:15:16.151 --> 01:15:19.621
I wondered if you could just
help me a little bit about...

01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:23.110
the money. We hear all kinds of figures.

01:15:26.791 --> 01:15:30.181
- There's so much of it.
- How much is "so much"?

01:15:30.311 --> 01:15:33.587
In one two-day period,
$6 million came in.

01:15:34.591 --> 01:15:37.185
- Six!
- Six million, cash.

01:15:39.311 --> 01:15:41.381
We didn't know where to put it all.

01:15:42.511 --> 01:15:45.708
I thought it was all legal.
I mean, I guess I did until...

01:15:45.911 --> 01:15:48.869
after the break-in when I
remembered Gordon got so much of it.

01:15:48.951 --> 01:15:51.385
- This is Mr. Liddy?
- It's all so rotten.

01:15:53.151 --> 01:15:54.664
It's getting worse.

01:15:55.631 --> 01:15:58.065
And the only one I care
about is Hugh Sloan.

01:15:58.671 --> 01:16:02.664
His wife was going to leave him if he
didn't stand up and do what was right.

01:16:03.031 --> 01:16:04.384
So, he quit.

01:16:05.751 --> 01:16:07.343
I was wondering...

01:16:09.071 --> 01:16:13.462
if Hugh Sloan was being set up now
as a fall guy for John Mitchell.

01:16:14.671 --> 01:16:16.024
What do you think?

01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:27.227
If you guys could get John
Mitchell, that would be beautiful.

01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:36.424
Coffee's cold.

01:16:38.631 --> 01:16:40.508
Is there any evidence that...

01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:43.940
any of Mr. Mitchell's assistants...

01:16:45.631 --> 01:16:47.144
were part of this?

01:16:47.631 --> 01:16:51.385
I had all the evidence. It was
destroyed. I don't know who destroyed it.

01:16:51.671 --> 01:16:54.663
- I think Gordon did a lot of shredding.
- Hard evidence?

01:16:54.751 --> 01:16:58.664
Well, I can't say that it would positively
prove that they planned the break-in...

01:16:58.751 --> 01:17:00.707
but it would come pretty close.

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:04.188
Can you tell me anything
about who got the money?

01:17:05.751 --> 01:17:07.184
We have...

01:17:07.711 --> 01:17:10.908
had some help on this
from a couple of sources...

01:17:11.511 --> 01:17:13.786
and this is a way of confirming it.

01:17:17.231 --> 01:17:19.187
I don't want you to feel
that you're in a position...

01:17:19.271 --> 01:17:21.227
where you have to disclose names.

01:17:21.431 --> 01:17:23.626
I can just ask you initials...

01:17:24.231 --> 01:17:27.189
and then that way you're not
divulging any information.

01:17:28.151 --> 01:17:30.745
We have some idea.
Would that be all right?

01:17:35.591 --> 01:17:36.944
Was there an "M"?

01:17:40.031 --> 01:17:41.862
Can you just nod either way?

01:17:43.311 --> 01:17:44.983
Did it go that high up?

01:17:48.911 --> 01:17:49.980
"L"?

01:17:52.031 --> 01:17:53.828
I don't want to say any more, okay?

01:17:53.911 --> 01:17:56.106
I'm sorry. You said "L"...

01:17:56.871 --> 01:17:58.350
or... I get confused.

01:17:58.911 --> 01:18:00.629
Could we just go back for a second?

01:18:01.031 --> 01:18:03.340
In one six-day period,
over $6 million came in.

01:18:03.431 --> 01:18:05.387
You wouldn't believe what was
going on inside that woman.

01:18:05.471 --> 01:18:06.790
The stuff was just ready to pour out.

01:18:06.871 --> 01:18:09.021
I'm pouring down cups of coffee
trying to get it out of her...

01:18:09.111 --> 01:18:10.305
before she throws me out of the house.

01:18:10.391 --> 01:18:12.109
- Give me your notes so...
- These are the notes.

01:18:12.191 --> 01:18:14.386
- These are the notes?
- I've got stuff on napkins, matchbooks...

01:18:14.471 --> 01:18:16.541
I'm writing in the bathroom
while she's getting coffee.

01:18:16.631 --> 01:18:18.349
- I'm a walking litter basket!
- You're crazy.

01:18:18.431 --> 01:18:20.899
You'd be crazy, too, if you were
operating on 20 cups of coffee.

01:18:20.991 --> 01:18:22.663
Could you give me
something I can get down?

01:18:22.751 --> 01:18:23.979
I got it. I got it all.

01:18:24.071 --> 01:18:25.424
Okay. Write.

01:18:25.591 --> 01:18:27.866
- Mitchell was in control.
- Wait a minute.

01:18:28.591 --> 01:18:30.502
- There were men working under Mitchell...
- How many?

01:18:30.591 --> 01:18:32.661
I don't know how many, but the
men working under Mitchell...

01:18:32.751 --> 01:18:34.343
received the money from the slush fund.

01:18:34.431 --> 01:18:35.864
Do we know how much money?

01:18:35.951 --> 01:18:38.021
We're talking about hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

01:18:38.111 --> 01:18:40.750
And these men are the key to
what that money was used for.

01:18:40.831 --> 01:18:42.230
Boy, that woman was paranoid.

01:18:42.311 --> 01:18:45.030
At one point, I suddenly wondered
how high up this thing goes...

01:18:45.111 --> 01:18:46.590
and her paranoia finally got to me.

01:18:46.671 --> 01:18:48.946
I thought what we had was so
hot, that any minute CBS or NBC...

01:18:49.031 --> 01:18:50.862
would come in through the
windows and take the story away.

01:18:50.951 --> 01:18:51.986
You're both paranoid.

01:18:52.071 --> 01:18:54.380
She's afraid of John Mitchell,
you're afraid of Walter Cronkite.

01:18:54.471 --> 01:18:56.507
- Right.
- Can we go back to what she said?

01:18:57.871 --> 01:18:59.862
Here. "L," "P," and "M."

01:19:01.231 --> 01:19:02.903
- What do you mean?
- It's "L," "P," and "M".

01:19:02.991 --> 01:19:04.743
- She'd only give initials.
- Initials?

01:19:04.831 --> 01:19:08.107
The initials are the name of the men that
worked under Mitchell. "L," "P," and "M."

01:19:08.191 --> 01:19:09.943
You couldn't get the names?

01:19:11.271 --> 01:19:13.262
If I could've gotten the names,
I would've gotten the names!

01:19:13.351 --> 01:19:14.909
I'm with the woman, trying
to get anything I can.

01:19:14.991 --> 01:19:17.061
She said "L," "P," and "M,"
that's all she would give me...

01:19:17.151 --> 01:19:18.823
are the people who
worked under Mitchell.

01:19:18.911 --> 01:19:21.550
She said something about
Mitchell. She hates him.

01:19:21.631 --> 01:19:22.984
<i>She said, "John Mitchell...</i>

01:19:23.071 --> 01:19:25.346
"If you guys could get John Mitchell,
that would be beautiful".

01:19:25.431 --> 01:19:27.820
Wait a minute, what's this here?
What are you writing about Sloan?

01:19:27.911 --> 01:19:29.867
"Sloan was the treasurer of
the Committee to Re-Elect.

01:19:29.951 --> 01:19:32.465
"His wife is pregnant and she made
Sloan quit because apparently...

01:19:32.551 --> 01:19:34.064
"he no longer wanted
to be a part of it".

01:19:34.151 --> 01:19:35.266
We've got to go see Sloan.

01:19:35.351 --> 01:19:37.706
Okay. Make a note of
it. So, what have we got?

01:19:37.791 --> 01:19:39.019
Where's that matchbook?

01:19:39.111 --> 01:19:40.226
- Here.
- "L," "P," and "M."

01:19:40.311 --> 01:19:41.539
Okay, "L," "P," and "M."

01:19:41.631 --> 01:19:44.270
- "L" could be La Rue. It could be Liddy.
- "L" is Liddy.

01:19:44.351 --> 01:19:46.182
- How do we know that?
- Because she said it.

01:19:46.271 --> 01:19:48.626
Right here. She said, "At
the time of the break-in...

01:19:48.711 --> 01:19:50.349
"there was so much
money floating around...

01:19:50.431 --> 01:19:51.784
"that I know Gordon got part of it".

01:19:51.871 --> 01:19:53.827
So I said, "You mean Gordon Liddy?"
She said, "Yes".

01:19:53.911 --> 01:19:56.106
So, "L" is Liddy. Okay,
that leaves "P" and "M."

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:57.670
"P" could be...

01:19:58.311 --> 01:20:01.508
Parkinson. It could be
Porter. It could be...

01:20:01.591 --> 01:20:04.503
Wait a minute! There was a guy once.
There was a guy we talked to last week.

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:06.229
Didn't he say that there
was a Bart Porter...

01:20:06.311 --> 01:20:08.222
who at one time was a member
of the Committee to Re-Elect?

01:20:08.311 --> 01:20:10.188
Porter was called before
the Grand Jury investigation.

01:20:10.271 --> 01:20:11.784
So "P" is definitely Porter.

01:20:11.871 --> 01:20:13.099
"P" could be Porter.

01:20:13.191 --> 01:20:16.103
"P" is Porter, "L" is Liddy.
All that leaves is "M"!

01:20:16.631 --> 01:20:19.020
"M" could be McCord? That's out.

01:20:19.471 --> 01:20:21.382
It could be Mardian.

01:20:22.111 --> 01:20:23.305
It could be...

01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:25.590
- Magruder!
- I think it's Magruder.

01:20:25.671 --> 01:20:27.821
- I think it's Magruder, too.
- Why do you think it's Magruder?

01:20:27.911 --> 01:20:29.424
Because he was second in
command under Mitchell.

01:20:29.511 --> 01:20:30.580
Why do you think it's Magruder?

01:20:30.671 --> 01:20:32.946
Because at one time he
was a temporary head...

01:20:33.031 --> 01:20:34.987
of the Committee to
Re-Elect, before Mitchell.

01:20:35.071 --> 01:20:36.106
I don't want a cookie.

01:20:36.191 --> 01:20:38.227
We've got to get that bookkeeper
to say it was Magruder.

01:20:38.311 --> 01:20:39.630
Never get her to say anything about "M."

01:20:39.711 --> 01:20:42.225
We have got to go back there
and try to get her to say it.

01:20:42.711 --> 01:20:45.430
If we could make names
of the initials...

01:20:45.591 --> 01:20:47.821
then we'll know the people at
CREEP who paid off the burglars.

01:20:47.911 --> 01:20:50.471
We'll at least know who got the money.

01:20:52.111 --> 01:20:54.864
The indictments that came down
from the Grand Jury today...

01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:56.100
stopped...

01:20:56.751 --> 01:20:59.219
with the five burglars, Hunt and Liddy.

01:20:59.471 --> 01:21:01.701
Carl, we have got to go back
there and get that bookkeeper...

01:21:01.791 --> 01:21:03.588
to say who the names
are and not initials.

01:21:03.671 --> 01:21:04.899
She ain't going to give it to you...

01:21:04.991 --> 01:21:06.344
because I was with the
woman for six hours.

01:21:06.431 --> 01:21:08.626
- We have to try.
- Then you'll have to trick her, threaten her.

01:21:08.711 --> 01:21:10.349
- She's not going to do it.
- Wait a minute.

01:21:10.431 --> 01:21:12.467
- You know what we could do?
- What?

01:21:15.231 --> 01:21:17.540
- Listen, we go back there...
- Yeah.

01:21:18.111 --> 01:21:20.261
...and you ask her who "P" is.
- Yeah.

01:21:20.351 --> 01:21:21.989
And then I say, "No,
don't worry about it...

01:21:22.071 --> 01:21:23.584
"we know 'P' is Porter".
I just bury it.

01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:25.787
Okay. Now, wait a minute.
I say to her, "Who is 'P'?"

01:21:25.871 --> 01:21:28.704
- And then you say to me...
- I say, "No, we know 'P' is Porter".

01:21:28.791 --> 01:21:30.463
- You mean, you try to fake her out?
- Right.

01:21:30.551 --> 01:21:33.065
- And what if she denies it?
- We're screwed.

01:21:33.151 --> 01:21:35.062
- So?
- But if she doesn't, we know we got it.

01:21:35.151 --> 01:21:37.346
- We know "P" is Porter.
- Try it.

01:21:46.391 --> 01:21:47.426
Hi.

01:21:47.551 --> 01:21:49.064
They'll see you.

01:21:49.711 --> 01:21:51.986
Not if you let us in, they won't.

01:21:52.071 --> 01:21:53.584
And I'm Bob Woodward.

01:21:53.671 --> 01:21:56.822
- They'll see your car.
- We parked around the corner.

01:21:57.711 --> 01:22:00.145
You have answers for
everything, don't you?

01:22:00.471 --> 01:22:02.666
If we did, we wouldn't be here.

01:22:04.791 --> 01:22:05.985
You wrote what I told you.

01:22:06.071 --> 01:22:08.027
Oh, no. Not your name.
No one knows it was you.

01:22:08.111 --> 01:22:10.227
Could you tell us who got the money?

01:22:10.831 --> 01:22:12.264
And how much?

01:22:13.191 --> 01:22:16.308
You mean like, "What did you
do with the $25,000, lady?"

01:22:16.591 --> 01:22:17.706
What?

01:22:18.511 --> 01:22:21.423
Little jokes they're making
down at Finance these days.

01:22:22.351 --> 01:22:23.750
If people are to be convinced...

01:22:23.831 --> 01:22:26.789
that Stans and Sloan are innocent,
then our reporting must be precise...

01:22:26.871 --> 01:22:28.429
and you can help us.

01:22:28.511 --> 01:22:29.546
Who is "P"?

01:22:29.631 --> 01:22:32.350
"P" we know, is Porter.
You said, "$25,000."

01:22:32.751 --> 01:22:34.787
Is that how much Porter got?

01:22:38.551 --> 01:22:39.870
Was it more?

01:22:44.751 --> 01:22:46.662
Was it more than $50,000?

01:22:50.191 --> 01:22:52.910
Was Magruder the only
"M" to receive money?

01:23:00.191 --> 01:23:02.147
Who told you about Porter?

01:23:03.911 --> 01:23:08.223
<i>I'd like to move on now to the subject
of the break-in at the Watergate...</i>

01:23:08.471 --> 01:23:10.780
<i>and the controversies that
keep coming up out of that.</i>

01:23:10.871 --> 01:23:13.943
<i>It has recently, very recently
been reported now, that...</i>

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:15.623
<i>some documents were torn up...</i>

01:23:15.711 --> 01:23:18.020
<i>at the Committee to
Re-Elect the President.</i>

01:23:18.111 --> 01:23:21.262
<i>Are you investigating the
tearing up of those documents...</i>

01:23:21.351 --> 01:23:23.945
<i>Well, I think that came out in
a story in the Washington Post.</i>

01:23:24.031 --> 01:23:25.908
<i>- Yes.
- I think the investigation...</i>

01:23:25.991 --> 01:23:27.709
<i>that has just concluded itself...</i>

01:23:27.791 --> 01:23:29.986
<i>has probably been one
of the most intensive...</i>

01:23:30.071 --> 01:23:33.666
<i>that the Department of Justice and
the FBI has ever been involved in.</i>

01:23:33.751 --> 01:23:35.787
<i>Some 1,500 persons were interviewed...</i>

01:23:35.871 --> 01:23:40.023
<i>1,800 leads were followed,
333 agents were involved...</i>

01:23:40.111 --> 01:23:41.749
<i>14,000 man-hours...</i>

01:23:42.231 --> 01:23:45.541
<i>fifty-one of the 59 FBI
field officers were involved.</i>

01:23:47.151 --> 01:23:49.267
<i>And that, I think...</i>

01:23:49.871 --> 01:23:52.749
<i>is a great credit to
justice in this country.</i>

01:23:52.831 --> 01:23:54.901
<i>Did you know that documents
had been destroyed?</i>

01:23:54.991 --> 01:23:56.060
<i>No, I did not.</i>

01:23:58.831 --> 01:24:02.187
All these neat little houses and
all these nice little streets.

01:24:02.711 --> 01:24:06.863
It's hard to believe that something's
wrong in some of those little houses.

01:24:07.311 --> 01:24:08.710
No, it isn't.

01:24:10.311 --> 01:24:12.347
- Hello, I'm Carl Bernstein.
- Bob Woodward.

01:24:12.431 --> 01:24:15.423
We'd just like to talk to Mr.
Sloan for a couple of minutes.

01:24:15.511 --> 01:24:18.344
- He's resting right now.
- Are you Mrs. Sloan?

01:24:19.751 --> 01:24:22.709
<i>- You're the two from the Post, aren't you?
- Yes.</i>

01:24:23.311 --> 01:24:24.790
This is an honest house.

01:24:24.871 --> 01:24:27.544
That's why we'd like
to see your husband.

01:24:27.791 --> 01:24:29.941
Faced with certain criminal
charges that might be brought...

01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:32.101
against some people that are
innocent, we just feel that...

01:24:32.191 --> 01:24:34.022
It's really for his benefit.

01:24:34.111 --> 01:24:35.510
No, it's not.

01:24:38.831 --> 01:24:41.061
No, it's not.

01:24:41.311 --> 01:24:43.905
Deborah, tell them to come in.

01:24:44.231 --> 01:24:45.300
Thanks.

01:24:45.391 --> 01:24:47.780
- Hi, Carl Bernstein.
- How do you do? Hugh Sloan.

01:24:47.871 --> 01:24:49.190
- Bob Woodward.
- How are you doing?

01:24:49.271 --> 01:24:51.705
I appreciate you giving us the time.

01:24:58.471 --> 01:25:00.621
You know, the reason that
we're here, basically...

01:25:00.711 --> 01:25:02.463
is that we've talked
to certain people who...

01:25:02.551 --> 01:25:04.587
have indicated that the reason
you left the Committee...

01:25:04.671 --> 01:25:07.026
was because you no longer
want to be part of it.

01:25:07.111 --> 01:25:09.067
Yeah, right. Maybe there's
a legitimate explanation...

01:25:09.151 --> 01:25:12.268
why the money was handed to
Liddy and Mitchell's aides.

01:25:15.351 --> 01:25:17.182
Try to understand this.

01:25:18.511 --> 01:25:20.627
- I'm a Republican.
- I am, too.

01:25:20.911 --> 01:25:22.947
Well, I believe in Richard Nixon.

01:25:23.031 --> 01:25:25.909
I worked in the White House for
four years and so did my wife.

01:25:25.991 --> 01:25:29.984
What happened on June 17, I don't
think the President knew anything about.

01:25:30.351 --> 01:25:32.660
Is it possible that some of
his people might have known?

01:25:32.751 --> 01:25:33.786
I'm not sure about that.

01:25:33.871 --> 01:25:35.827
Do you think the truth will
ever come out at the trial?

01:25:35.911 --> 01:25:37.788
- That's another thing I'm not sure about.
- Why?

01:25:37.871 --> 01:25:40.339
Well, obviously, because certain
people lied to the prosecutor.

01:25:40.431 --> 01:25:42.581
No. We were never told
flat out, "Don't talk!"

01:25:42.671 --> 01:25:44.423
But the message was clear, though.

01:25:44.511 --> 01:25:47.423
In other words, by their very
silence, there was a cover-up.

01:25:47.511 --> 01:25:50.184
Well, they didn't urge us to
come forward and tell the truth.

01:25:50.271 --> 01:25:52.227
"They," meaning the White House?

01:25:52.311 --> 01:25:54.427
Well, the Committee's not
an independent operation.

01:25:54.511 --> 01:25:56.422
Everything's cleared
with the White House.

01:25:56.511 --> 01:25:59.583
And I don't think the FBI or
the prosecutors understand that.

01:25:59.671 --> 01:26:01.548
That report on the cash...

01:26:02.431 --> 01:26:06.106
in the CREEP safe, that $350,000?

01:26:06.191 --> 01:26:08.580
- No, more.
- Was that a correct figure?

01:26:08.671 --> 01:26:10.866
No, it was closer to $1,000,000.

01:26:12.271 --> 01:26:14.831
And, as treasurer, you
could release those funds?

01:26:14.911 --> 01:26:16.424
When so ordered.

01:26:16.711 --> 01:26:19.066
We don't know the names of
the people who could order you.

01:26:19.151 --> 01:26:21.267
- We just know that there were four.
- No, there were five.

01:26:21.351 --> 01:26:24.070
Mitchell, Stans,
Magruder, they're obvious.

01:26:24.911 --> 01:26:28.108
- There had to be a White House overseer.
- Yeah, Colson.

01:26:28.351 --> 01:26:32.105
No, Colson's too smart to get involved
directly with anything like that.

01:26:33.071 --> 01:26:34.504
It's Haldeman.

01:26:36.711 --> 01:26:37.826
Right?

01:26:39.311 --> 01:26:40.983
I won't talk about the other two.

01:26:41.071 --> 01:26:42.868
They both worked at the White House?

01:26:42.951 --> 01:26:46.421
One of them did, the other one's not
in Washington. But that's all I'll say.

01:26:46.511 --> 01:26:48.627
- Kalmbach.
- Nixon's personal lawyer.

01:26:48.951 --> 01:26:50.862
- Right?
- Nixon's personal lawyer?

01:26:50.951 --> 01:26:53.181
I can't say anything. I'm sorry.

01:26:54.831 --> 01:26:56.981
<i>- Well...
- When's the baby due?</i>

01:26:59.311 --> 01:27:00.903
Soon. Next month.

01:27:01.591 --> 01:27:04.264
- Are you going to stay here?
- No, I don't think so.

01:27:04.351 --> 01:27:06.148
Decided where you're gonna go?

01:27:06.231 --> 01:27:09.667
<i>I've been looking for a job in
the private sector, but it's...</i>

01:27:10.071 --> 01:27:12.949
It's very hard. My name's
been in the papers too much.

01:27:14.351 --> 01:27:17.741
You know, one thing I'm just
still not completely clear about?

01:27:18.991 --> 01:27:22.028
When you handed out the money,
how did that work, exactly?

01:27:22.111 --> 01:27:23.260
Badly.

01:27:26.751 --> 01:27:30.744
I think what Bob means is, that
ordinarily, what was the procedure?

01:27:31.031 --> 01:27:34.262
Routine. I'd call John Mitchell
over at the Justice Department.

01:27:34.351 --> 01:27:35.909
He'd say, "Go ahead,
give out the money".

01:27:35.991 --> 01:27:37.982
This was all done verbally?

01:27:38.911 --> 01:27:39.946
Yes.

01:27:40.831 --> 01:27:43.220
Okay, we know there were five
men who controlled the slush fund.

01:27:43.311 --> 01:27:44.380
Mitchell, Stans, and Magruder.

01:27:44.471 --> 01:27:47.304
Yeah, those three we've got. And all
three have been named by two sources.

01:27:47.391 --> 01:27:49.029
What about the other two?

01:27:49.471 --> 01:27:51.382
- Kalmbach.
- We're pretty sure of Kalmbach.

01:27:51.711 --> 01:27:54.384
Maybe we better wait
until we get all five, huh?

01:27:54.471 --> 01:27:55.620
Certain on Mitchell?

01:27:55.711 --> 01:27:58.828
We know that he approved payments to
Liddy while he was Attorney General.

01:27:58.911 --> 01:28:00.583
- You've got more than one source?
- Yes, Harry.

01:28:00.671 --> 01:28:01.706
- Who are they?
- Sloan.

01:28:01.791 --> 01:28:02.826
Sloan and who else?

01:28:02.911 --> 01:28:04.822
There's another guy at Justice
who so far won't confirm...

01:28:04.911 --> 01:28:07.220
the names of the others who control
the fund. We're working on it.

01:28:07.311 --> 01:28:09.222
- What about Deep Throat?
- He's not a source on this.

01:28:09.311 --> 01:28:10.585
- But do any of them have an axe?
- No.

01:28:10.671 --> 01:28:12.389
Personal, political, sexual.

01:28:12.471 --> 01:28:13.984
- Is there anything at all on Mitchell?
- No.

01:28:14.071 --> 01:28:15.424
- Then can we use their names?
- No.

01:28:15.511 --> 01:28:19.470
God damn it! When is somebody gonna
go on the record in this story?

01:28:22.031 --> 01:28:25.103
You guys are about to write a story
that says the former Attorney General...

01:28:25.191 --> 01:28:28.900
the highest ranking law enforcement
officer in this country is a crook!

01:28:32.031 --> 01:28:33.987
Just be sure you're right.

01:28:36.831 --> 01:28:39.629
<i>- Essex House, may I help you?
- John Mitchell.</i>

01:28:47.391 --> 01:28:48.426
<i>Yes?</i>

01:28:49.231 --> 01:28:51.620
<i>Sir, this is Carl Bernstein
of the Washington Post...</i>

01:28:51.711 --> 01:28:54.020
and I'm sorry to
disturb you at this hour.

01:28:54.111 --> 01:28:57.706
Tomorrow we're running
a story in the paper...

01:28:57.791 --> 01:29:01.181
and we just think that you should
have a chance to comment on it.

01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:03.945
<i>What does it say?</i>

01:29:04.591 --> 01:29:06.980
"John N. Mitchell, while serving...

01:29:07.071 --> 01:29:10.029
"as United States Attorney General...

01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:12.466
"personally controlled
a secret cash fund...

01:29:12.551 --> 01:29:14.906
"that was used to gather
information about the Democrats...

01:29:14.991 --> 01:29:16.185
<i>- "according to"...
- Jesus.</i>

01:29:16.271 --> 01:29:18.262
"...sources involved in
the Watergate investigation".

01:29:18.351 --> 01:29:21.229
<i>- Jesus.
- "Beginning in the spring of 1971...</i>

01:29:21.311 --> 01:29:23.381
"almost a year before he
left the Justice Department...

01:29:23.471 --> 01:29:25.826
"to become President
Nixon's campaign manager...

01:29:25.911 --> 01:29:29.984
"on March 1, Mitchell personally
approved withdrawals from the fund".

01:29:30.071 --> 01:29:32.505
<i>All that crap. You're
putting it in the paper?</i>

01:29:32.591 --> 01:29:34.661
<i>- Well...
- It's all been denied.</i>

01:29:35.311 --> 01:29:37.222
<i>You tell your publisher,
tell Katie Graham...</i>

01:29:37.311 --> 01:29:40.428
<i>she's going to get her tit caught in
the big ringer if that's published.</i>

01:29:40.511 --> 01:29:43.071
<i>Christ, that's the most
sickening thing I ever heard.</i>

01:29:43.151 --> 01:29:45.346
Sir, I was just wondering if
I could ask you some questions?

01:29:45.431 --> 01:29:47.740
<i>- What time is it?
- It's 11:30, sir.</i>

01:29:48.311 --> 01:29:51.144
<i>11:30? Is it morning or night?</i>

01:29:51.231 --> 01:29:53.108
It's 11:30 at night, sir.

01:29:54.711 --> 01:29:58.863
Sir, the Committee to Re-Elect has
issued a statement to our story...

01:29:58.951 --> 01:30:00.543
but there are just a
couple of questions...

01:30:00.631 --> 01:30:03.429
<i>Did the Committee tell you to
go ahead and publish the story?</i>

01:30:03.511 --> 01:30:05.945
<i>You fellows have got
a great ballgame going.</i>

01:30:06.031 --> 01:30:09.387
<i>As soon as you're done, we're
going to do a story on all of you.</i>

01:30:09.471 --> 01:30:11.223
Sir, there's just a
couple of questions...

01:30:11.311 --> 01:30:13.381
<i>Call my law office in the morning.</i>

01:30:16.031 --> 01:30:18.545
There's no question you
properly identified yourself?

01:30:18.631 --> 01:30:20.747
He said it right off the top.

01:30:21.631 --> 01:30:23.462
Mitchell know he was
talking to a reporter?

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:25.781
Yeah, but I think I woke him up.

01:30:26.231 --> 01:30:28.187
- Get good notes?
- Verbatim.

01:30:29.871 --> 01:30:32.431
He really said that about Mrs. Graham?

01:30:33.951 --> 01:30:35.782
Well, I'd cut the words
"her tit" and print it.

01:30:35.871 --> 01:30:36.906
Why?

01:30:36.991 --> 01:30:38.982
This is a family newspaper.

01:30:42.231 --> 01:30:43.630
You know, once when I was reporting...

01:30:43.711 --> 01:30:46.179
Lyndon Johnson's top
guy gave me the word.

01:30:46.711 --> 01:30:49.703
They were looking for a
successor for J. Edgar Hoover.

01:30:49.791 --> 01:30:53.386
I wrote it and the day it appeared,
Johnson held a press conference...

01:30:53.471 --> 01:30:56.349
and appointed Hoover
head of the FBI for life.

01:30:56.831 --> 01:30:59.470
When he was done, he
turned to his top guy...

01:30:59.551 --> 01:31:03.066
and the President said,
"Call Ben Bradlee and tell him, 'Fuck you' ".

01:31:03.591 --> 01:31:05.866
Then everybody said, "You
did it, Ben. You screwed up.

01:31:05.951 --> 01:31:08.340
"You stuck us with Hoover forever".

01:31:09.351 --> 01:31:11.911
I screwed up, but I wasn't wrong.

01:31:15.711 --> 01:31:18.430
How much can you tell
me about Deep Throat?

01:31:19.391 --> 01:31:21.507
How much do you need to know?

01:31:21.591 --> 01:31:23.149
Do you trust him?

01:31:24.751 --> 01:31:25.786
Yeah.

01:31:27.951 --> 01:31:32.342
I can't do the reporting for my reporters
which means I have to trust them.

01:31:33.951 --> 01:31:35.987
And I hate trusting anybody.

01:31:43.991 --> 01:31:45.470
Run that, baby.

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:27.464
<i>The Washington Post reported that while
still in office as Attorney General...</i>

01:32:27.551 --> 01:32:31.544
<i>John Mitchell had personally
controlled a secret Republican fund.</i>

01:32:31.671 --> 01:32:35.459
<i>Mitchell denied any such involvement
and called the story ludicrous.</i>

01:32:35.831 --> 01:32:38.982
<i>The new charge also brought a
response from Vice President Agnew...</i>

01:32:39.071 --> 01:32:40.390
<i>at his stop in Tampa.</i>

01:32:40.471 --> 01:32:43.144
<i>I have full confidence
in Mr. Mitchell...</i>

01:32:43.951 --> 01:32:46.988
<i>and in the people in the
Republican organization.</i>

01:32:47.071 --> 01:32:50.825
<i>And I think that that kind
of unattributed report...</i>

01:32:50.911 --> 01:32:53.584
<i>at a time like this
is counterproductive.</i>

01:32:53.751 --> 01:32:57.346
<i>We must bear in mind that
those who published it...</i>

01:32:58.231 --> 01:33:01.303
<i>have already shown their
sympathy for the other ticket.</i>

01:33:01.391 --> 01:33:02.983
<i>A band and some young cheerleaders...</i>

01:33:03.071 --> 01:33:04.424
All non-denial denials.

01:33:04.511 --> 01:33:07.150
They doubt our ancestry, but they
don't say the story isn't accurate.

01:33:07.231 --> 01:33:09.187
I mean, did you understand
one thing he was saying?

01:33:09.271 --> 01:33:12.343
What I can't figure out
is, what is a real denial?

01:33:12.471 --> 01:33:16.464
Well, if they start calling us goddamn
liars, we better start circling the wagons.

01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:18.343
When do you think
they'll start doing that?

01:33:18.431 --> 01:33:19.910
When they get out of Tampa.

01:33:21.151 --> 01:33:23.745
Joe, come on. What's going
on with you guys at the FBI?

01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:25.389
I've been trying to
get to you for weeks.

01:33:25.471 --> 01:33:26.745
Your secretary says you're not in.

01:33:26.831 --> 01:33:28.822
Last night I called, you
said you couldn't talk...

01:33:28.911 --> 01:33:31.471
and this morning, as soon as our
Mitchell story hits the stands...

01:33:31.551 --> 01:33:33.826
you call me and say you've
got to see me right away. Why?

01:33:33.911 --> 01:33:36.425
Look, you guys have been causing
big trouble at the Bureau.

01:33:36.511 --> 01:33:37.546
Why?

01:33:37.911 --> 01:33:41.221
Our reports are showing up
in your paper almost verbatim.

01:33:41.311 --> 01:33:44.860
I mean, you've really been on
the mark, except for Mitchell.

01:33:44.951 --> 01:33:46.987
Now, we didn't have that...

01:33:47.351 --> 01:33:49.865
- that he controlled the funds.
- Right.

01:33:50.031 --> 01:33:51.783
Our agents have been busting ass...

01:33:51.871 --> 01:33:54.180
but we're gonna go back now and
see if we've missed anything.

01:33:54.271 --> 01:33:55.943
What I don't understand
is all the people...

01:33:56.031 --> 01:33:58.022
who might know details of
the bugging operation...

01:33:58.111 --> 01:33:59.669
the FBI hasn't even talked to.

01:33:59.751 --> 01:34:02.140
And why have you conducted your
interviews of CREEP personnel...

01:34:02.231 --> 01:34:03.346
at CREEP headquarters...

01:34:03.431 --> 01:34:06.343
instead of at their homes where
they might feel freer to talk?

01:34:06.431 --> 01:34:07.580
Joe, wait a minute.

01:34:07.671 --> 01:34:10.344
Why have the interviews at
CREEP always been conducted...

01:34:10.431 --> 01:34:12.945
within the presence of the
lawyer who works for CREEP?

01:34:13.031 --> 01:34:15.909
Look, you know I can't
answer for the whole Bureau.

01:34:15.991 --> 01:34:18.789
- Oh, come on, I'm just...
- I do what I'm told.

01:34:19.991 --> 01:34:22.107
I followed my orders. Period.

01:34:28.071 --> 01:34:29.390
What orders?

01:34:33.391 --> 01:34:35.302
Wait. Woodward!

01:34:37.831 --> 01:34:38.866
Wait!

01:34:40.151 --> 01:34:41.186
Bob!

01:34:43.911 --> 01:34:46.220
Out of the blue. Out of the blue.

01:34:48.311 --> 01:34:51.428
Okay, this morning I get a tip to call
a guy by the name of Alex Shipley...

01:34:51.511 --> 01:34:53.900
who is now the Assistant
Attorney General of Tennessee.

01:34:53.991 --> 01:34:56.459
<i>Now, the guy told me, that
called me, that said...</i>

01:34:56.551 --> 01:34:59.111
He said that Shipley was
asked in the summer of 1971...

01:34:59.191 --> 01:35:01.500
by an old army buddy,
a Donald Segretti...

01:35:01.591 --> 01:35:03.388
to join a group of other lawyers...

01:35:03.471 --> 01:35:05.826
for Nixon's campaign to sabotage
the Democratic candidates.

01:35:05.911 --> 01:35:07.822
Listen, make a left when you
can. We'll go to my place.

01:35:07.911 --> 01:35:08.980
Sabotage Democratic candidates?

01:35:09.071 --> 01:35:11.426
That's right. Now, I was able to
make a couple of calls today...

01:35:11.551 --> 01:35:13.303
<i>and I got Segretti's
records for the year...</i>

01:35:13.391 --> 01:35:16.224
His travel records for the years 1971
- '72.

01:35:16.751 --> 01:35:17.820
<i>Does the FBI know about...</i>

01:35:17.911 --> 01:35:19.105
- Did you say left or right?
- Left!

01:35:19.191 --> 01:35:21.466
We're going to my place. We
gotta go over the records.

01:35:21.551 --> 01:35:24.224
- Does the FBI know about Segretti?
- The FBI interrogated Segretti...

01:35:24.311 --> 01:35:26.905
and found out he wasn't involved
in the break-in so they dropped it.

01:35:26.991 --> 01:35:28.026
They didn't follow through on it.

01:35:28.111 --> 01:35:29.180
- Where is he?
- He's in California.

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:32.029
- Jesus, look at this.
- What?

01:35:32.111 --> 01:35:35.501
Segretti crisscrossed the
country at least a dozen times.

01:35:37.071 --> 01:35:39.744
He only stayed in cities where
there were Democratic primaries.

01:35:39.831 --> 01:35:43.107
Well, if the break-in is just one
incident in a campaign of sabotage...

01:35:43.191 --> 01:35:44.749
that began a whole
year before Watergate...

01:35:44.831 --> 01:35:46.708
then for the first time,
the break-in makes sense.

01:35:46.791 --> 01:35:47.906
This isn't so crazy.

01:35:47.991 --> 01:35:50.221
This thing didn't start with
the bugging at the headquarters.

01:35:50.311 --> 01:35:52.302
Segretti was doing this
a year before the bugging.

01:35:52.391 --> 01:35:54.109
And a year before, Nixon
wasn't slaughtering Muskie.

01:35:54.191 --> 01:35:57.740
He was running behind Muskie,
before Muskie self-destructed.

01:35:58.151 --> 01:35:59.903
If he self-destructed.

01:36:00.951 --> 01:36:03.340
- Hi. Donald Segretti?
- That's right.

01:36:03.631 --> 01:36:06.429
<i>I'm Carl Bernstein from
the Washington Post.</i>

01:36:06.951 --> 01:36:07.986
Hi.

01:36:08.791 --> 01:36:10.509
What can I do for you?

01:36:10.591 --> 01:36:14.903
Well, my paper just sent me out here to
try to persuade you to go on the record.

01:36:15.151 --> 01:36:16.186
Why me?

01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:18.307
I guess because you were
the head coordinator...

01:36:18.391 --> 01:36:21.747
of Nixon's sabotage campaign
against the Democrats.

01:36:22.951 --> 01:36:25.863
- Carl, you want some coffee?
- You read my mind.

01:36:31.471 --> 01:36:33.348
Carl, tell me something.

01:36:34.271 --> 01:36:36.739
What do you imagine the
head coordinator does?

01:36:36.831 --> 01:36:40.540
Well, I guess basically you're involved
in recruiting other people like yourself...

01:36:40.631 --> 01:36:41.666
other lawyers.

01:36:41.751 --> 01:36:44.311
- Lawyers?
- Like Alex Shipley.

01:36:45.311 --> 01:36:49.099
I made it clear that I would not
do anything violent or illegal.

01:36:49.351 --> 01:36:51.421
What do you mean by illegal?

01:36:51.911 --> 01:36:55.426
<i>Watergate, I mean, that's... The
whole bugging. That's horrendous!</i>

01:36:55.791 --> 01:36:58.021
And what kind of stuff
do you guys do then?

01:36:58.111 --> 01:36:59.908
Nickel-and-dime
stuff.

01:37:01.031 --> 01:37:04.262
Stuff. Stuff with a
little wit attached to it.

01:37:04.351 --> 01:37:06.467
You mean, when you sent out
on Muskie's stationery that...

01:37:06.551 --> 01:37:09.702
Senator Hubert Humphrey was
going out with call girls?

01:37:10.111 --> 01:37:12.750
Listen, if anything, it
helped the man's image.

01:37:12.831 --> 01:37:15.868
What was the one on Muskie's
stationery that you sent out...

01:37:15.951 --> 01:37:19.307
that said that Scoop Jackson
was having a bastard child?

01:37:19.711 --> 01:37:22.942
So, sometimes it got up to
a quarter. Off the record.

01:37:23.471 --> 01:37:27.225
I think one of the most interesting
ones was the Canuck letter.

01:37:28.151 --> 01:37:29.584
What about it?

01:37:30.271 --> 01:37:33.661
Come on. Where you claimed that
Muskie slurred the Canadians.

01:37:33.831 --> 01:37:35.708
No, I didn't write that.

01:37:36.031 --> 01:37:37.180
Do you know who did?

01:37:37.271 --> 01:37:40.422
Carl, when you guys print it
in the papers, then I'll know.

01:37:40.511 --> 01:37:42.103
Smart guy, Donald.

01:37:42.791 --> 01:37:44.349
You're no dummy.

01:37:45.191 --> 01:37:46.863
I'm a lawyer, Carl.

01:37:47.431 --> 01:37:49.820
I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer...

01:37:50.391 --> 01:37:54.066
and I'll probably wind up going
to jail and being disbarred...

01:37:54.711 --> 01:37:58.829
and I don't know what I did
that was so goddamn awful.

01:38:04.311 --> 01:38:07.223
I'll tell you something.
None of this was my idea.

01:38:07.311 --> 01:38:09.108
I didn't go looking for the job.

01:38:09.191 --> 01:38:11.022
Well, that's important.

01:38:12.151 --> 01:38:13.823
Chapin came to you.

01:38:20.391 --> 01:38:21.426
You know what?

01:38:21.511 --> 01:38:25.345
It's funny, but I keep forgetting that
you guys knew each other in college.

01:38:25.431 --> 01:38:28.946
You were friends at SC, you
and Chapin. Who else was there?

01:38:29.351 --> 01:38:30.830
There was me...

01:38:31.591 --> 01:38:32.706
Dwight...

01:38:33.191 --> 01:38:34.419
Ziegler...

01:38:34.591 --> 01:38:36.070
all the USC mafia.

01:38:36.231 --> 01:38:39.064
And that's when you got involved
in meaningless student elections...

01:38:39.151 --> 01:38:43.064
<i>when you start to try to get your man
in so you stuffed ballot boxes and...</i>

01:38:43.151 --> 01:38:46.507
What's that term you guys use
for screwing up the opposition?

01:38:46.631 --> 01:38:49.020
- Rat-fucking.
- That's right.

01:38:49.111 --> 01:38:50.829
You were just doing the
same kind of stuff...

01:38:50.911 --> 01:38:53.550
when you were out campaigning
for President Nixon.

01:38:53.631 --> 01:38:57.260
Let me tell you something, we did
a lot of worse things in college.

01:38:58.311 --> 01:39:00.506
Look, let me ask you something, Carl.

01:39:00.871 --> 01:39:03.431
What would you have done if you
were just getting out of the army...

01:39:03.511 --> 01:39:05.547
been away from the real
world for four years...

01:39:05.631 --> 01:39:08.782
didn't know what kind of
law you wanted to practice...

01:39:08.871 --> 01:39:11.339
and one day you get a
call from an old friend...

01:39:11.431 --> 01:39:15.185
asking if you want to go to work for
the President of the United States?

01:39:15.951 --> 01:39:19.341
Chapin was the appointment
secretary for Nixon when he called.

01:39:19.431 --> 01:39:22.389
Yeah. Listen, if those sinister
things really happened...

01:39:22.471 --> 01:39:24.223
I don't think Dwight
knew anything about them.

01:39:24.311 --> 01:39:25.790
He just did what he was told.

01:39:25.871 --> 01:39:27.224
Told by who?

01:39:37.991 --> 01:39:40.107
What's the topic for tonight?

01:39:45.071 --> 01:39:46.424
Rat-fucking.

01:39:48.431 --> 01:39:51.503
In my day it was simply
known as the double-cross.

01:39:52.351 --> 01:39:54.307
In our present context...

01:39:55.991 --> 01:39:58.630
it means infiltration of the Democrats.

01:40:00.471 --> 01:40:02.780
Segretti won't go on the record...

01:40:02.991 --> 01:40:06.142
but if he would, we know
he would implicate Chapin.

01:40:07.591 --> 01:40:10.469
And that would put you
inside the White House.

01:40:11.271 --> 01:40:12.306
Who?

01:40:14.591 --> 01:40:15.910
Be specific.

01:40:16.991 --> 01:40:18.344
How high up?

01:40:21.511 --> 01:40:24.230
You'll have to find
that out for yourself.

01:40:25.671 --> 01:40:27.548
I don't like newspapers.

01:40:29.511 --> 01:40:32.230
I don't care for inexactitude...

01:40:33.111 --> 01:40:34.669
and shallowness.

01:40:35.991 --> 01:40:39.063
The CREEP slush fund that
financed the rat-fucking...

01:40:39.151 --> 01:40:41.346
we've just about got that
nailed down. I don't know how...

01:40:41.431 --> 01:40:43.103
Did you change cabs?

01:40:50.031 --> 01:40:51.066
Yeah.

01:40:51.751 --> 01:40:53.981
Does the FBI know what we know?

01:40:57.991 --> 01:40:59.424
Does Justice?

01:41:03.471 --> 01:41:05.666
Why haven't they done anything?

01:41:06.311 --> 01:41:10.589
If it didn't deal directly with
the break-in, they didn't pursue.

01:41:11.671 --> 01:41:13.389
Who told them not to?

01:41:13.711 --> 01:41:16.305
Don't you understand what you're on to?

01:41:19.711 --> 01:41:22.623
- Mitchell knew?
- Of course Mitchell knew.

01:41:23.511 --> 01:41:26.150
Do you think something
this size just happens?

01:41:26.231 --> 01:41:27.983
Haldeman had to know, too.

01:41:28.071 --> 01:41:30.744
You'll get nothing
from me about Haldeman.

01:41:34.631 --> 01:41:36.030
Segretti said that...

01:41:36.111 --> 01:41:39.421
Don't concentrate on Segretti.
You'll miss the overall.

01:41:41.631 --> 01:41:44.941
The letter that destroyed
the Muskie candidacy...

01:41:45.031 --> 01:41:47.101
the Canuck letter, did that
come from inside the White...

01:41:47.191 --> 01:41:48.909
You're missing the overall.

01:41:49.071 --> 01:41:50.345
But what overall?

01:41:50.431 --> 01:41:53.582
They were frightened of Muskie,
and look who got destroyed.

01:41:53.671 --> 01:41:57.380
They wanted to run against McGovern.
Look who they're running against.

01:41:57.511 --> 01:42:00.389
They bugged, they followed people...

01:42:00.871 --> 01:42:03.101
false press leaks, fake letters.

01:42:03.751 --> 01:42:06.106
They canceled Democratic
campaign rallies.

01:42:06.191 --> 01:42:09.183
They investigated
Democratic private lives.

01:42:09.831 --> 01:42:12.709
They planted spies, stole
documents, and on and on.

01:42:12.791 --> 01:42:17.023
Now, don't tell me you think this is
all the work of little Don Segretti.

01:42:19.271 --> 01:42:21.387
The FBI and Justice know this?

01:44:46.191 --> 01:44:47.340
- Carl?
- Yeah.

01:44:47.431 --> 01:44:49.342
Why don't you pick up
your messages more often?

01:44:49.431 --> 01:44:51.183
- Right. You got a cigarette?
- Yeah.

01:44:51.391 --> 01:44:52.540
Who's Pete Teller?

01:44:52.631 --> 01:44:55.828
I haven't the slightest idea, Carl. I
have this whole place to take care of.

01:44:55.911 --> 01:44:57.503
- Carl?
- Yeah, one second.

01:44:59.151 --> 01:45:01.949
Tell him to leave his phone number
next time, all right? Hi, Sally.

01:45:02.031 --> 01:45:03.862
Listen, do you guys know
about the Canuck letter?

01:45:03.951 --> 01:45:05.066
Yep. I'm sorry, I'm late.

01:45:05.151 --> 01:45:07.824
I just wanted to make
sure you knew who wrote it.

01:45:08.871 --> 01:45:11.180
What?

01:45:11.391 --> 01:45:13.507
You mean the letter that
sabotaged the Muskie candidacy?

01:45:13.591 --> 01:45:15.183
All right, come here.

01:45:15.351 --> 01:45:17.307
When did he tell you this?

01:45:20.311 --> 01:45:22.222
Gotta tell Bob.

01:45:25.351 --> 01:45:26.943
- Woodward.
- What?

01:45:27.791 --> 01:45:30.100
<i>One second. Very important... Come here.</i>

01:45:31.471 --> 01:45:33.427
Tell him what you told me.

01:45:34.471 --> 01:45:35.950
Here, sit down.

01:45:37.751 --> 01:45:41.027
Just exactly the way you
said it to me, say it to him.

01:45:41.591 --> 01:45:43.821
Ken Clawson told me he
wrote the Canuck letter.

01:45:43.911 --> 01:45:45.742
The letter that said Muskie
was slurring the Canadians.

01:45:45.831 --> 01:45:46.866
Clawson?

01:45:46.951 --> 01:45:49.829
The Deputy Director of White House
Communications wrote the Canuck letter.

01:45:49.911 --> 01:45:51.947
- When did he tell you this?
- When we were having drinks.

01:45:52.031 --> 01:45:53.828
- Where were you?
- My apartment.

01:45:53.911 --> 01:45:55.902
- When did you say he told you?
- Two weeks ago.

01:45:55.991 --> 01:45:58.459
What else did he say?
He didn't say anything?

01:45:58.551 --> 01:45:59.586
Come on, you're hedging.

01:45:59.671 --> 01:46:02.231
You think he said it to impress you
to get you to go to bed with him?

01:46:02.311 --> 01:46:04.142
- Jesus.
- No, I want to hear her say it.

01:46:04.231 --> 01:46:07.428
Do you think he said that to impress
you, try to get you to go to bed with him?

01:46:07.511 --> 01:46:10.787
Why did it take you two
weeks to tell us this, Sally?

01:46:12.031 --> 01:46:15.660
I guess I don't have the taste
for the jugular you guys have.

01:46:18.711 --> 01:46:20.429
You're claiming it was
all a misunderstanding?

01:46:20.511 --> 01:46:22.661
<i>Absolutely. Sally's got it all wrong.</i>

01:46:22.751 --> 01:46:24.707
<i>I never told her that
I wrote that letter.</i>

01:46:24.791 --> 01:46:26.782
<i>We were just shooting the
breeze about the election.</i>

01:46:26.871 --> 01:46:28.065
She's an awfully good reporter.

01:46:28.151 --> 01:46:30.301
I don't remember her getting
that much wrong before, do you?

01:46:30.391 --> 01:46:32.666
<i>Look, that's a real
bullshit question, Woodward.</i>

01:46:32.751 --> 01:46:35.424
<i>That is a question straight
out of Wichita, Kansas.</i>

01:46:35.511 --> 01:46:36.910
Listen. One last thing.

01:46:36.991 --> 01:46:39.869
Do you remember where this
shooting the breeze took place?

01:46:39.951 --> 01:46:41.828
<i>What do you mean, where?</i>

01:46:42.071 --> 01:46:44.426
I mean, was it a restaurant,
or her apartment, or a bar?

01:46:44.511 --> 01:46:46.467
<i>Now, look. I'd forgotten
the entire incident...</i>

01:46:46.551 --> 01:46:48.587
<i>but it most certainly
wasn't in her apartment.</i>

01:46:48.671 --> 01:46:52.107
<i>- Do you remember when it took place?
- I don't have time for this. I'm a busy man.</i>

01:46:52.191 --> 01:46:53.226
Did you get all that?

01:46:53.311 --> 01:46:55.222
What did he say about meeting
in a bar or restaurant?

01:46:55.311 --> 01:46:56.664
He said he forgot the entire incident.

01:46:56.751 --> 01:46:59.106
- That means he didn't deny it.
- That's a non-denial denial.

01:46:59.191 --> 01:47:00.590
Wichita, Kansas?

01:47:00.671 --> 01:47:02.662
Yeah, he said that's a
bullshit question, Woodward...

01:47:02.751 --> 01:47:04.867
I know what he said. But
I'm from Wheaton, Illinois.

01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:06.464
Hey, Bob, Carl. He's on the phone.

01:47:06.551 --> 01:47:07.984
- Who?
- Clawson.

01:47:11.711 --> 01:47:15.340
Get over there on line 4 and
transcribe this, will you? Four.

01:47:16.071 --> 01:47:17.663
- Four?
- Okay. Yeah.

01:47:19.151 --> 01:47:20.220
Yes, Ken.

01:47:20.311 --> 01:47:23.542
<i>Sally, for Christ's sakes, don't
tell them I came to your place.</i>

01:47:23.631 --> 01:47:25.986
Why not? What's wrong with
coming over for a drink?

01:47:26.071 --> 01:47:28.460
<i>You and me? In your apartment?</i>

01:47:29.271 --> 01:47:30.306
Well?

01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:33.420
<i>Jesus Christ, you just shot me down.</i>

01:47:33.511 --> 01:47:37.106
<i>If that appears in the papers that
I'm over at your house, having...</i>

01:47:37.831 --> 01:47:40.550
<i>- Do you know what that does?
- No, I don't see why.</i>

01:47:40.631 --> 01:47:42.587
<i>You don't? You don't?</i>

01:47:43.671 --> 01:47:46.822
<i>- There's nothing bad about it.
- Well, there sure is.</i>

01:47:48.951 --> 01:47:50.828
<i>This is just incredible.</i>

01:47:51.551 --> 01:47:53.189
Well, I have a clear conscience.

01:47:53.271 --> 01:47:56.263
<i>Sally, I have a wife, and a
family, and a dog, and a cat.</i>

01:47:57.671 --> 01:47:59.502
She said that he was in
her house having drinks.

01:47:59.591 --> 01:48:02.628
Now, look, I don't care where it
happened. What happened is what counts.

01:48:02.711 --> 01:48:05.748
When we asked him about it, he
said he forgot the entire incident.

01:48:06.071 --> 01:48:08.266
<i>- Yeah?
- Ken Clawson on the line.</i>

01:48:08.431 --> 01:48:10.661
- Ken Clawson on the line.
- Jesus.

01:48:13.551 --> 01:48:15.269
Ken. What's up, kid?

01:48:15.351 --> 01:48:18.070
<i>Ben, now, look, this whole thing
that's going on over there, Ben...</i>

01:48:18.151 --> 01:48:21.029
<i>I want you to know that I never
claimed authorship of the Canuck letter!</i>

01:48:21.111 --> 01:48:22.510
Says he never wrote the letter.

01:48:22.591 --> 01:48:25.389
<i>It's some kind of misunderstanding,
a confusion, I want you to know...</i>

01:48:25.471 --> 01:48:28.349
Slow down, Ken. You sound frazzled.

01:48:28.431 --> 01:48:29.830
<i>Now, Ben, please, listen.</i>

01:48:29.911 --> 01:48:33.301
<i>If you're going to refer to that
alleged conversation with Sally Aiken...</i>

01:48:33.391 --> 01:48:35.700
<i>you can't print that it
took place in her apartment.</i>

01:48:35.791 --> 01:48:38.430
<i>I have a wife, and a
family, and a dog, and a cat.</i>

01:48:38.511 --> 01:48:40.706
"A wife, and a family,
and a dog, and a cat".

01:48:40.791 --> 01:48:42.782
Right, Ken, right. Yeah.

01:48:42.871 --> 01:48:46.102
Now, Ken, I don't want to print
that you were in Sally's apartment.

01:48:46.191 --> 01:48:47.226
<i>Thank God.</i>

01:48:47.311 --> 01:48:50.621
I just want to know what you
said in Sally's apartment.

01:49:03.031 --> 01:49:04.430
<i>- Hello.
- Bernstein...</i>

01:49:04.511 --> 01:49:07.821
<i>I just got a tip from our FBI source.
The secret cash fund financed Segretti.</i>

01:49:07.911 --> 01:49:09.549
<i>- Jesus.
- All right. Now, listen.</i>

01:49:09.631 --> 01:49:12.941
<i>Chapin hired Segretti, we know that.
And we know Haldeman hired Chapin.</i>

01:49:13.031 --> 01:49:15.545
<i>Haldeman has to be the fifth
name to control the fund.</i>

01:49:16.431 --> 01:49:17.830
Sloan knows.

01:49:20.071 --> 01:49:22.266
We've only got four out of the
five who controlled the fund.

01:49:22.351 --> 01:49:23.625
It has to be Haldeman.

01:49:23.711 --> 01:49:25.702
I don't think we've got it.

01:49:26.191 --> 01:49:28.068
We know the fifth is a
top White House official.

01:49:28.151 --> 01:49:30.062
But no one has said it.
No one has named Haldeman.

01:49:30.151 --> 01:49:33.860
- No one's denied it.
- That still doesn't prove it was Haldeman.

01:49:35.631 --> 01:49:37.826
If you go to bed at night and
there's no snow on the ground...

01:49:37.911 --> 01:49:39.549
when you wake up and
there's snow on the ground...

01:49:39.631 --> 01:49:42.145
you can say it snowed during the
night, although you didn't see it.

01:49:42.231 --> 01:49:44.540
But if we can't prove the fifth
man is Haldeman, we're wiped out.

01:49:44.631 --> 01:49:46.587
Everything in that campaign
is done with his approval.

01:49:46.671 --> 01:49:48.548
We know that everybody
who works under Haldeman...

01:49:48.631 --> 01:49:50.462
does so with his knowledge.

01:49:50.551 --> 01:49:52.507
And everybody is under
Haldeman, except the President.

01:49:52.591 --> 01:49:54.821
Common sense says it's Haldeman.

01:49:57.071 --> 01:49:58.948
If we go and see Sloan...

01:49:59.031 --> 01:50:03.263
<i>and we tell him that we know that he
named Haldeman to the Grand Jury...</i>

01:50:04.671 --> 01:50:07.310
Then all we would need to
do is have him confirm it.

01:50:07.391 --> 01:50:08.506
Right.

01:50:09.031 --> 01:50:11.147
- Want to do it that way?
- Yes.

01:50:12.191 --> 01:50:14.227
Let's go back and see Sloan.

01:50:17.551 --> 01:50:19.542
We can't go now 'cause
he's not home yet.

01:50:20.271 --> 01:50:23.024
He may not be answering,
but he might be there.

01:50:37.231 --> 01:50:38.300
- Hi.
- Please.

01:50:38.391 --> 01:50:41.064
Listen, we've already written the
story. We just need you to define...

01:50:41.151 --> 01:50:43.028
Deborah's in the hospital
and my in-laws are coming...

01:50:43.111 --> 01:50:44.749
- Two questions?
- We understand.

01:50:44.831 --> 01:50:46.264
Two questions?

01:50:49.471 --> 01:50:51.860
The cash that financed
the Watergate break-in...

01:50:51.951 --> 01:50:53.589
five men had control of the fund.

01:50:53.671 --> 01:50:56.549
Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach.
We have confirmations on those four.

01:50:56.631 --> 01:50:59.304
- We just found out Haldeman's the fifth.
- I'm not your source on that.

01:50:59.391 --> 01:51:02.110
We're not asking you to be our source.
All we're asking is to confirm it.

01:51:02.191 --> 01:51:03.306
I'm not your source on Haldeman.

01:51:03.391 --> 01:51:05.347
Okay, look, when you were
questioned by the Grand Jury...

01:51:05.431 --> 01:51:06.466
You had to name names.

01:51:06.551 --> 01:51:09.987
<i>- Of course, everything they asked, yes.
- Lf they asked you. All right if they...</i>

01:51:12.671 --> 01:51:15.185
<i>I don't know... Say we wrote a
story that said that Haldeman...</i>

01:51:15.271 --> 01:51:16.989
was the fifth name to control the fund.

01:51:17.071 --> 01:51:20.063
- Would we be in any trouble?
- Would we be wrong?

01:51:23.431 --> 01:51:25.262
Let me put it this way.

01:51:25.591 --> 01:51:28.663
I would have no problems if
you wrote a story like that.

01:51:28.751 --> 01:51:30.343
- You wouldn't?
- No.

01:51:32.111 --> 01:51:34.022
- That's okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

01:51:34.511 --> 01:51:36.706
- Oh, you had a baby.
- Yes, my wife did.

01:51:36.791 --> 01:51:38.110
- Little boy or girl?
- That's terrific.

01:51:38.191 --> 01:51:39.226
It's a girl.

01:51:39.311 --> 01:51:40.983
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:51:41.071 --> 01:51:42.789
- We're sorry to bother you.
- Yeah.

01:51:42.871 --> 01:51:45.465
- Will you give our best to her?
- I will.

01:51:48.431 --> 01:51:51.662
Well, I think that, Woodward,
and I am curious of the fact...

01:51:51.751 --> 01:51:54.629
<i>that the FBI, in its entire
inquiry, never talked to the...</i>

01:51:54.711 --> 01:51:57.828
Or did any inquiries into the second
most-powerful man to the President.

01:51:57.911 --> 01:51:59.469
<i>You don't seem to understand.</i>

01:51:59.551 --> 01:52:02.019
<i>No, you get nothing
about Haldeman out of me.</i>

01:52:02.311 --> 01:52:04.063
But we don't need to know anything, Joe.

01:52:04.151 --> 01:52:06.221
Tomorrow we're going
with a story on the FBI.

01:52:06.311 --> 01:52:07.346
<i>Now, what does that mean?</i>

01:52:07.431 --> 01:52:09.308
And we're going to
establish in that story...

01:52:09.391 --> 01:52:11.700
that you guys just about
blew the whole investigation.

01:52:11.791 --> 01:52:13.509
<i>Oh, no, we didn't miss so much.</i>

01:52:13.591 --> 01:52:15.502
You didn't know Haldeman had
control of the slush fund?

01:52:15.591 --> 01:52:17.263
<i>Oh, yes, we did. It's all in our files.</i>

01:52:17.351 --> 01:52:19.581
<i>- Not about Haldeman.
- Yeah, Haldeman. John Haldeman.</i>

01:52:19.671 --> 01:52:23.107
<i>Look, now, look, I'm very busy.
I've got to go put the kids to bed.</i>

01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:27.305
That's the confirmation right there.

01:52:28.431 --> 01:52:30.786
Wait a minute, wait a
sec. Did he say John?

01:52:31.311 --> 01:52:33.347
- He said Haldeman.
- He said John Haldeman.

01:52:33.431 --> 01:52:35.820
What the hell difference does it
make if he said Isaiah or David?

01:52:35.911 --> 01:52:36.980
There's only one Haldeman.

01:52:37.071 --> 01:52:40.381
Yeah, well, Isaiah or David
aren't assistants to the President.

01:52:40.871 --> 01:52:42.668
I don't know, it still feels thin.

01:52:42.751 --> 01:52:44.707
Christ, I just wish we
knew if we could print this.

01:52:44.791 --> 01:52:46.827
Now wait a minute, we didn't
make them do these things...

01:52:46.911 --> 01:52:48.310
but once they did, they're fair game!

01:52:48.391 --> 01:52:50.586
Harry, let's go over your
sources again. I want to hear it.

01:52:50.671 --> 01:52:53.663
Sloan told the Grand Jury. He
answered everything they asked him.

01:52:53.751 --> 01:52:55.582
That means there's gotta
be a record somewhere.

01:52:55.671 --> 01:52:58.663
He told the Grand Jury, the FBI
confirms. What more do you need?

01:52:58.751 --> 01:52:59.866
I happen to love this country.

01:52:59.951 --> 01:53:02.021
You know, we're not a bunch
of zanies out to bring it down!

01:53:02.111 --> 01:53:03.749
Harry, weren't you
arguing the opposite way?

01:53:03.831 --> 01:53:05.310
No, not at all.

01:53:05.471 --> 01:53:06.506
All right, now hold it.

01:53:06.591 --> 01:53:08.661
One thing has nothing
to do with the other.

01:53:08.871 --> 01:53:11.180
We're about to accuse Haldeman
who only happens to be...

01:53:11.271 --> 01:53:13.102
the second-most-important
man in this country...

01:53:13.191 --> 01:53:15.864
of conducting a criminal conspiracy
from inside the White House.

01:53:15.951 --> 01:53:17.623
It would be nice if we were right.

01:53:17.711 --> 01:53:19.588
- Have you double-checked
your sources? - Jesus.

01:53:19.671 --> 01:53:22.344
- Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
- Absolutely!

01:53:22.431 --> 01:53:24.103
- Woodward?
- I'm sure.

01:53:24.671 --> 01:53:26.946
I'm not. It still seems thin.

01:53:27.231 --> 01:53:28.505
Get another source.

01:53:28.591 --> 01:53:31.583
How many fucking sources
do they think we've got?

01:53:34.871 --> 01:53:38.147
- Are you sure Deep Throat won't confirm?
- He won't confirm, I told you that.

01:53:38.231 --> 01:53:39.425
What about the guy in Justice?

01:53:39.511 --> 01:53:41.422
You can't call him. He's
right next to the Grand Jury.

01:53:41.511 --> 01:53:43.820
- We have no choice. It's trouble.
- It's 20 minutes to deadline.

01:53:43.911 --> 01:53:46.630
I don't even know if I
can get him on the phone.

01:54:01.031 --> 01:54:03.386
<i>- Dr. Kissinger's office.
- Deputy General's office, please.</i>

01:54:08.031 --> 01:54:09.749
Do you know when you expect him back?

01:54:09.831 --> 01:54:11.742
<i>No, sir. I believe he's
left for the evening.</i>

01:54:11.831 --> 01:54:15.187
<i>If you'd like to leave a message...
Oh, could you hold, please?</i>

01:54:15.271 --> 01:54:17.546
Hi, this is Carl. I'm
sorry to disturb you now...

01:54:17.631 --> 01:54:20.020
but we're going with the story
that Haldeman was the fifth man...

01:54:20.111 --> 01:54:21.988
in control of the fund and
they're hassling us here.

01:54:22.071 --> 01:54:24.631
We've got three confirmations. If
you could help us, I'd appreciate it.

01:54:24.711 --> 01:54:26.383
<i>I won't say anything
about Haldeman. Not ever.</i>

01:54:26.471 --> 01:54:27.984
I understand. We wouldn't
want you to do that.

01:54:28.071 --> 01:54:29.982
We know it's against the
law for you to say anything.

01:54:30.071 --> 01:54:32.983
If there's a way you could warn us to
hold on the story, we'd appreciate it.

01:54:33.071 --> 01:54:34.948
<i>I'd really like to
help you, but I can't.</i>

01:54:35.031 --> 01:54:37.386
Look, I'm going to
count to 10, all right?

01:54:37.471 --> 01:54:39.427
If there's any reason we
should hold on the story...

01:54:39.511 --> 01:54:41.024
hang up the phone before I get to 10.

01:54:41.111 --> 01:54:44.626
If the story's all right, you just be on
the phone after I get to 10, all right?

01:54:44.711 --> 01:54:46.508
<i>- Hang up, right?
- That's right.</i>

01:54:46.591 --> 01:54:47.865
<i>- You got it?
- Yeah.</i>

01:54:47.951 --> 01:54:50.624
We're straight. All right, I'm
going to start counting, okay?

01:54:50.711 --> 01:54:51.905
<i>- We all right?
- Yeah.</i>

01:54:51.991 --> 01:54:53.140
Okay, I'm counting.

01:54:53.231 --> 01:54:55.301
One, two...

01:54:55.831 --> 01:54:58.868
three, four, five...

01:54:59.511 --> 01:55:01.502
six, seven...

01:55:02.751 --> 01:55:06.460
eight, nine, ten.

01:55:08.271 --> 01:55:10.944
<i>You got it straight
now? Everything okay?</i>

01:55:11.591 --> 01:55:13.229
Everything's fine.

01:55:16.671 --> 01:55:17.865
Woodward!

01:55:22.751 --> 01:55:24.025
We got it.

01:55:26.311 --> 01:55:27.505
- He confirmed.
- What happened?

01:55:27.591 --> 01:55:30.105
I said if I get up to 10 and
you don't hang up, it's solid.

01:55:30.191 --> 01:55:31.340
- Did he confirm it?
- Absolutely.

01:55:31.431 --> 01:55:33.387
We've got to tell Bradlee!

01:55:41.671 --> 01:55:45.186
Bernstein got another source.
The guy at Justice confirmed.

01:55:45.351 --> 01:55:47.023
If there's any doubt,
we can run it tomorrow.

01:55:47.111 --> 01:55:49.102
You don't have to. The story's
solid. We're sure of it.

01:55:49.191 --> 01:55:52.069
I just got off the phone
with him. It's gold.

01:55:53.191 --> 01:55:54.943
Okay, we go with it.

01:56:07.591 --> 01:56:08.865
Woodstein!

01:56:23.711 --> 01:56:25.827
- You know what it's about?
- No.

01:56:26.631 --> 01:56:28.542
<i>Sloan, who resigned as
campaign treasurer...</i>

01:56:28.631 --> 01:56:30.269
<i>after the Watergate break-in...</i>

01:56:30.351 --> 01:56:32.911
<i>showed up for a deposition
in the common-cause suit on...</i>

01:56:32.991 --> 01:56:36.666
<i>disclosure of campaign contributions,
and denied naming Haldeman.</i>

01:56:36.751 --> 01:56:39.504
<i>Mr. Sloan, would you care to comment
on testimony before the Grand Jury?</i>

01:56:39.591 --> 01:56:41.263
<i>I'd like my attorney
to answer that question.</i>

01:56:41.351 --> 01:56:43.421
<i>Gentlemen, the answer
is an unequivocal "no".</i>

01:56:43.511 --> 01:56:46.708
<i>Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr.
Haldeman in that testimony at all.</i>

01:56:46.791 --> 01:56:48.702
<i>It is in his testimony that
Mr. Sloan acknowledged...</i>

01:56:48.791 --> 01:56:50.622
<i>- that it was an espionage fund?
- No, not at all.</i>

01:56:50.711 --> 01:56:52.702
<i>Did he mention any use of
funds for espionage activity?</i>

01:56:52.791 --> 01:56:54.702
<i>None, whatsoever. Thank
you, gentlemen. Thank you.</i>

01:56:54.791 --> 01:56:57.863
<i>Sloan expanded his denial to
include his statements to the FBI...</i>

01:56:57.951 --> 01:57:00.909
<i>and to all federal authorities. A
short time later at the White House...</i>

01:57:00.991 --> 01:57:03.585
<i>News Secretary Ronald Ziegler
delivered a strong attack...</i>

01:57:03.671 --> 01:57:05.389
<i>on the Washington Post.</i>

01:57:05.471 --> 01:57:08.747
<i>Why is the Post trying to
do it? You have a man...</i>

01:57:09.791 --> 01:57:13.022
<i>who is the editor of the Washington
Post by the name of Ben Bradlee.</i>

01:57:13.111 --> 01:57:16.467
<i>I think anyone who would
want to honestly assess...</i>

01:57:16.551 --> 01:57:19.429
<i>what his political
persuasions are, would...</i>

01:57:19.511 --> 01:57:21.979
<i>I think come to the
conclusion, quite quickly...</i>

01:57:22.071 --> 01:57:24.744
<i>that he is not a supporter
of President Nixon.</i>

01:57:24.831 --> 01:57:26.389
<i>I respect the free press.</i>

01:57:26.471 --> 01:57:29.304
<i>I don't respect the
type of journalism...</i>

01:57:29.831 --> 01:57:33.619
<i>the shabby journalism that is being
practiced by the Washington Post.</i>

01:57:33.711 --> 01:57:36.623
<i>All I know is that the story
that ran this morning...</i>

01:57:37.391 --> 01:57:39.666
<i>is incorrect and it's been so...</i>

01:57:40.551 --> 01:57:42.667
<i>stated as being incorrect...</i>

01:57:43.111 --> 01:57:45.705
<i>by not only me, but by the individual...</i>

01:57:45.991 --> 01:57:48.824
<i>whose Grand Jury, secret
Grand Jury testimony...</i>

01:57:48.911 --> 01:57:50.583
<i>they based their story on.</i>

01:57:50.671 --> 01:57:54.220
<i>And that individual has denied
that he ever so testified.</i>

01:57:54.911 --> 01:57:57.823
<i>No sooner had Ziegler finished, than
the President's campaign manager...</i>

01:57:57.911 --> 01:57:59.708
<i>Clark MacGregor, met with reporters.</i>

01:57:59.791 --> 01:58:01.349
<i>Using innuendo...</i>

01:58:01.471 --> 01:58:03.268
<i>third-person hearsay...</i>

01:58:03.351 --> 01:58:06.343
<i>unsubstantiated charges,
anonymous sources...</i>

01:58:06.631 --> 01:58:08.667
<i>and huge, scare headlines...</i>

01:58:08.751 --> 01:58:11.743
<i>the Post has maliciously
sought to give the appearance...</i>

01:58:11.831 --> 01:58:14.789
<i>of a direct connection between
the White House and the Watergate.</i>

01:58:14.871 --> 01:58:16.862
<i>A charge which the Post knows...</i>

01:58:16.951 --> 01:58:20.227
<i>and half a dozen investigations
have found to be false.</i>

01:58:20.951 --> 01:58:23.988
<i>The hallmark of the Post
campaign is hypocrisy...</i>

01:58:24.551 --> 01:58:28.544
<i>and its celebrated double standard
is today visible for all to see.</i>

01:58:29.031 --> 01:58:31.226
I'm not talking to you about
Haldeman or anybody else.

01:58:31.311 --> 01:58:32.426
- Then what went wrong?
- Nothing.

01:58:32.511 --> 01:58:33.626
Just tell us what went wrong?

01:58:33.711 --> 01:58:36.544
Didn't you say that the FBI had the
information on Haldeman in the files?

01:58:36.631 --> 01:58:38.030
- No.
- Because we have it in the notes...

01:58:38.111 --> 01:58:40.067
from the conversation we had
on the telephone right here.

01:58:40.151 --> 01:58:42.142
We have to go talk to your
boss if you don't talk to us.

01:58:42.231 --> 01:58:44.950
What the hell are you talking
about? I'll deny everything.

01:58:45.031 --> 01:58:46.623
We're not trying to get
anybody into trouble.

01:58:46.711 --> 01:58:48.667
We're just trying to find
out if we made some errors.

01:58:48.751 --> 01:58:50.662
If we made a mistake, then
we'll come off the story.

01:58:50.751 --> 01:58:54.460
Just tell us if we're wrong.
Tell us if we screwed up.

01:58:54.631 --> 01:58:56.223
I'm not talking about it.

01:58:56.311 --> 01:58:59.383
I am not talking to you about
Haldeman or anybody else.

01:58:59.471 --> 01:59:02.031
In fact, I can't even be seen
talking to either one of you bastards.

01:59:02.111 --> 01:59:05.342
- What are you afraid of? Who got to you?
- Are we being set up?

01:59:06.231 --> 01:59:08.062
- Are we, Joe? Tell us!
- Are we being set up?

01:59:08.151 --> 01:59:10.540
- Just tell us, we won't print it.
- Fuck you.

01:59:10.791 --> 01:59:12.190
And fuck you!

01:59:18.711 --> 01:59:19.860
Honest to God, I just don't know.

01:59:19.951 --> 01:59:21.862
- Oh, I see.
- It's in the notes!

01:59:22.631 --> 01:59:26.306
Yeah, we had another call on a long list
and I've got another call, I've gotta go.

01:59:26.391 --> 01:59:28.700
- Did you mean Bob Haldeman?
- Yeah, Bob Haldeman.

01:59:31.271 --> 01:59:33.341
Jesus, what was our mistake?

01:59:33.671 --> 01:59:35.707
Maybe there was no mistake.

01:59:35.911 --> 01:59:39.870
Then they're just setting us up.
Then the whole thing was a set-up?

01:59:41.271 --> 01:59:43.068
And they just hung us.

01:59:43.791 --> 01:59:46.510
More denunciations. You'll
have to make a statement, Ben.

01:59:46.591 --> 01:59:50.425
One senator just gave a speech
slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.

01:59:50.511 --> 01:59:53.787
I knew we had enemies, but I
didn't know we were this popular.

01:59:54.351 --> 01:59:55.943
Wow, look at this.

01:59:58.311 --> 02:00:00.029
My non-denial denial.

02:00:08.711 --> 02:00:11.020
Fuck it, let's stand by the boys.

02:00:11.631 --> 02:00:13.064
Okay. Foreign?

02:00:14.351 --> 02:00:16.228
All right, here's our headline.

02:00:16.311 --> 02:00:19.701
Radio Hanoi reports the United
States-North Vietnam agreement...

02:00:19.791 --> 02:00:21.861
for a settlement of the Vietnam War.

02:00:29.591 --> 02:00:32.105
<i>Woodward, what did you
find out? What'd he say?</i>

02:00:32.191 --> 02:00:33.306
What time is it?

02:00:33.391 --> 02:00:35.541
<i>- You fell asleep?
- God damn it!</i>

02:01:56.391 --> 02:01:57.665
Over here.

02:02:20.431 --> 02:02:22.262
You let Haldeman slip away.

02:02:22.351 --> 02:02:23.386
Yes.

02:02:23.471 --> 02:02:25.587
You've done worse than
let Haldeman slip away.

02:02:25.671 --> 02:02:29.346
You've got people feeling sorry for
him. I didn't think that was possible.

02:02:29.431 --> 02:02:31.228
In a conspiracy like this...

02:02:31.311 --> 02:02:34.621
you build from the outer
edges and you go step by step.

02:02:34.791 --> 02:02:38.386
If you shoot too high and miss,
everybody feels more secure.

02:02:38.631 --> 02:02:42.180
- You put the investigation back months.
- Yes, we know that.

02:02:42.551 --> 02:02:44.985
And if we're wrong, we're resigning.

02:02:46.311 --> 02:02:47.744
Were we wrong?

02:02:49.791 --> 02:02:51.827
You'll have to find that out, won't you?

02:02:51.911 --> 02:02:54.709
Listen, I'm tired of
your chicken-shit games!

02:02:55.951 --> 02:02:57.623
I don't want hints.

02:02:58.151 --> 02:03:00.221
I need to know what you know.

02:03:15.471 --> 02:03:17.507
It was a Haldeman operation.

02:03:18.951 --> 02:03:22.626
The whole business was run by
Haldeman, the money, everything.

02:03:23.031 --> 02:03:27.104
It won't be easy getting at him. He was
insulated. You'll have to find out how.

02:03:30.791 --> 02:03:33.828
Mitchell started doing covert
stuff before anyone else.

02:03:33.911 --> 02:03:36.709
The list is longer
than anyone can imagine.

02:03:38.951 --> 02:03:42.626
It involves the entire U.S.
Intelligence community...

02:03:44.191 --> 02:03:45.306
FBI...

02:03:46.471 --> 02:03:49.668
CIA, Justice. It's incredible.

02:03:52.431 --> 02:03:54.467
The cover-up had little
to do with Watergate.

02:03:54.551 --> 02:03:57.782
It was mainly to protect
the covert operations.

02:03:59.711 --> 02:04:01.383
It leads everywhere.

02:04:04.391 --> 02:04:06.825
Get out your notebook. There's more.

02:04:12.711 --> 02:04:14.667
Your lives are in danger.

02:04:16.231 --> 02:04:18.699
Hi, I finally got Sloan on the phone.

02:05:35.111 --> 02:05:36.988
Why the hell didn't you
tell me over the phone?

02:05:37.071 --> 02:05:39.107
- Woodward says phones aren't safe.
- Can't trust them.

02:05:39.191 --> 02:05:40.909
- Come on in.
- We can't come in, sir.

02:05:40.991 --> 02:05:43.903
Woodward says there's
electronic surveillance.

02:05:59.911 --> 02:06:01.981
- Surveillance? Who's doing it?
- It's being done.

02:06:02.071 --> 02:06:04.301
People's lives are in
danger. Maybe even ours.

02:06:04.391 --> 02:06:06.109
What happened to that
Justice source of yours?

02:06:06.191 --> 02:06:07.943
I guess I made the
instructions too complicated.

02:06:08.031 --> 02:06:10.306
Because he thought I said "hang up"
when I just said "hang on".

02:06:10.391 --> 02:06:12.302
- Oh, Jesus!
- The story is right.

02:06:12.391 --> 02:06:14.302
Haldeman was the fifth
name to control that fund...

02:06:14.391 --> 02:06:17.349
- and Sloan would've told the Grand Jury.
- Sloan wanted to tell the Jury.

02:06:17.431 --> 02:06:18.784
- Why didn't he?
- Because nobody asked.

02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:20.270
Nobody asked him.

02:06:20.351 --> 02:06:22.103
The cover-up had little
to do with the break-in.

02:06:22.191 --> 02:06:24.625
It was to protect covert operations
and the covert activities...

02:06:24.711 --> 02:06:26.986
involving the entire U.S.
Intelligence community.

02:06:27.071 --> 02:06:29.585
Did Deep Throat say that
people's lives are in danger?

02:06:29.671 --> 02:06:30.706
Yes.

02:06:30.791 --> 02:06:34.340
- What else did he say?
- He said everyone is involved.

02:06:42.031 --> 02:06:44.591
You know the results of
the latest Gallup Poll?

02:06:44.671 --> 02:06:47.390
Half the country never even
heard of the word "Watergate".

02:06:47.471 --> 02:06:49.189
Nobody gives a shit.

02:06:51.711 --> 02:06:54.066
You guys are probably
pretty tired, right?

02:06:54.471 --> 02:06:56.701
You should be. Go on home.

02:06:57.271 --> 02:06:59.990
Get a nice hot bath,
rest up 15 minutes...

02:07:00.391 --> 02:07:02.700
then get your asses back in gear.

02:07:03.151 --> 02:07:06.826
We're under a lot of pressure,
you know, and you put us there.

02:07:08.151 --> 02:07:12.508
Nothing's riding on this except the
First Amendment of the Constitution...

02:07:12.591 --> 02:07:16.061
freedom of the press, and
maybe the future of the country.

02:07:18.031 --> 02:07:20.226
Not that any of that matters...

02:07:20.431 --> 02:07:23.582
but if you guys fuck up
again, I'm going to get mad.

02:07:25.551 --> 02:07:26.825
Goodnight.

02:07:53.591 --> 02:07:55.627
<i>And now, fellow Americans...</i>

02:07:55.911 --> 02:07:59.745
<i>the Honorable Chief Justice will
administer the oath of office...</i>

02:08:00.311 --> 02:08:03.348
<i>to the President of the
United States of America.</i>

02:08:03.431 --> 02:08:05.023
<i>Mr. Chief Justice.</i>

02:08:26.351 --> 02:08:29.980
<i>Mr. President, are you ready
to take the constitutional oath?</i>

02:08:30.191 --> 02:08:34.309
<i>If you will place your left hand on
the Bible and raise your right hand...</i>

02:08:34.391 --> 02:08:38.987
<i>and please repeat after me. "I,
Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear...</i>

02:08:39.111 --> 02:08:41.625
<i>"I, Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear...</i>

02:08:41.711 --> 02:08:46.068
<i>"...that I will faithfully execute the office

02:08:46.311 --> 02:08:49.940
<i>"...that I will faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States...</i>

02:08:50.031 --> 02:08:54.468

02:08:58.951 --> 02:09:02.785
<i>"...preserve and protect and defend

02:09:02.871 --> 02:09:05.669
