WEBVTT

00:03.820 --> 00:05.963
(TV playing faintly)

00:08.917 --> 00:10.175
What are you doing?

00:10.327 --> 00:12.845
I'm just really turned on
by this movie.

00:13.072 --> 00:14.421
<i> Hidden Figures?</i>

00:14.515 --> 00:17.474
It's about ladies who do math
for the space program.

00:18.668 --> 00:20.352
I know. Say it again.

00:21.747 --> 00:22.837
Oh.

00:22.931 --> 00:24.172
All right, well,

00:24.191 --> 00:25.766
the one lady just filled up
the chalkboard

00:25.918 --> 00:28.877
with all sorts of numbers
and fraternity letters.

00:28.937 --> 00:30.103
(chuckles)

00:30.256 --> 00:32.847
Mmm. Are her mean male bosses
impressed?

00:32.941 --> 00:35.092
Yeah, and they're
a little mad about it.

00:35.185 --> 00:36.535
Yeah, they are.

00:37.763 --> 00:40.097
-(phone ringing)
-Mm. Terrible timing.

00:40.190 --> 00:41.448
It must be my mother.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.100
Yeah, she must have sensed
I was happy.

00:43.269 --> 00:44.935
Can't it wait an hour?

00:44.953 --> 00:46.270
An hour?

00:46.288 --> 00:47.454
I'm building in time
to finish the movie.

00:47.606 --> 00:49.790
Geez.
(sighs)

00:49.884 --> 00:51.124
Hello, Mother.

00:51.277 --> 00:52.442
Katharine, I need you
to go to the store

00:52.461 --> 00:54.202
-to get me some batteries.
-(steady beeping)

00:54.221 --> 00:56.113
Why would you need batteries
at 10:00 at night?

00:56.206 --> 00:57.413
Actually, don't answer that.

00:57.466 --> 00:59.374
Kat, the rocket's
ready to launch.

00:59.468 --> 01:01.042
(whispers):
Both rockets.

01:01.062 --> 01:04.288
<i> I'm sorry, but</i>
<i> my smoke detector is beeping,</i>

01:04.306 --> 01:06.381
and you know
I can't drive myself.

01:06.475 --> 01:08.642
(sighs) I suppose
I could shoot it down

01:08.794 --> 01:10.811
with your father's pistol.

01:10.905 --> 01:13.297
I'll-I'll be right there.

01:13.390 --> 01:15.632
<i> Also, I need milk.</i>
<i> You're a dear. Bye.</i>

01:15.725 --> 01:16.633
(groans)

01:16.726 --> 01:18.318
Wait, you're really gonna go?

01:18.412 --> 01:21.062
Yeah. She's losing her eyesight.

01:21.231 --> 01:22.414
And when they took away
her license,

01:22.641 --> 01:24.065
I promised I would help her out.

01:24.234 --> 01:25.417
Okay.

01:25.644 --> 01:27.402
If you trust me alone
with all these math ladies.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.979
(scoffs) Very cute.

01:29.148 --> 01:32.482
You know I'm the only math lady
who can factor your polynomials.

01:32.501 --> 01:34.760
-Yeah, factor me, baby.
-(laughs)

01:34.911 --> 01:36.762
Okay, I'll be back soon.

01:36.931 --> 01:39.473
(door opens, closes)

01:40.175 --> 01:42.518
What are polynomials?

01:44.330 --> 01:46.629
-Hello.
-Ah. What took you so long?

01:47.349 --> 01:48.682
What did you do to your hair?

01:48.834 --> 01:51.593
Did you drive here
with your head out the window?

01:51.612 --> 01:54.020
This is just my normal hair,
Mother.

01:54.173 --> 01:55.763
And before you ask, yes,

01:55.783 --> 01:58.117
this is what I wore
to the store.

01:58.344 --> 01:59.618
Here's your milk and batteries.

01:59.769 --> 02:01.027
Where's the smoke detector?

02:01.122 --> 02:02.346
Oh, funny story.

02:02.364 --> 02:03.956
It wasn't
the smoke detector beeping.

02:04.107 --> 02:05.182
It was the freezer.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.442
-What?
-The door was open.

02:07.536 --> 02:09.294
I didn't even know it beeped.

02:09.446 --> 02:12.205
My fault
for not buying American.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.092
Wonder where she put that gun.

02:16.044 --> 02:17.469
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

02:17.621 --> 02:19.972
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

02:21.533 --> 02:22.290
Hey, y'all.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.050
(imitating):
Hey, y'all.

02:24.203 --> 02:27.371
Sorry. We just spent five hours
running errands with my mother,

02:27.481 --> 02:29.464
and I think maybe
Max has hit his limit.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.542
An hour of looking at birthday
cards for her friend Elaine,

02:32.636 --> 02:34.878
who she-- and I quote--
"isn't a big fan of,"

02:34.897 --> 02:38.048
and, "Shoulders back, Max.
Somebody here might know me,"

02:38.066 --> 02:39.658
end quote.

02:41.011 --> 02:43.311
I haven't gotten a birthday card
from my mother since I was 12.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.314
It said,
"My condolences, Steve."

02:46.333 --> 02:48.742
I kept it.
It means a lot to me.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.395
Really? Your mom always sends me
a birthday card.

02:51.488 --> 02:53.230
I got a random one last week
that just said,

02:53.248 --> 02:55.749
"I'm proud of you."

02:55.901 --> 02:58.010
PHIL:
Oh, everybody be cool.

02:58.161 --> 02:59.661
My crush is here. Quick.

02:59.829 --> 03:01.346
Laugh like I said
something funny.

03:01.498 --> 03:03.423
(laughter)

03:03.592 --> 03:07.978
Oh, Phil, jumbo shrimp.
Which is it?!

03:09.190 --> 03:10.672
(chuckles):
Oh, hey, Jalen.

03:10.766 --> 03:14.100
I didn't realize you walked in
while I was amusing my friends.

03:14.253 --> 03:16.102
-Hey, everyone.
-Hi.
-Hey.

03:16.255 --> 03:17.587
Hi, I'm Max, nice to meet you.

03:17.681 --> 03:19.923
Okay, enough of that.

03:19.942 --> 03:21.942
Straight people, am I right?

03:22.094 --> 03:25.019
Uh, I'm Kat. I'm straight, too,
but I'm cool.

03:25.113 --> 03:27.706
-Eh.
-(chuckles)

03:27.933 --> 03:29.433
I just wanted to drop by

03:29.451 --> 03:31.451
and invite you all
to my drag show tonight.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.604
-Oh!
-Got to show the boss
I can put asses in seats,

03:34.698 --> 03:35.956
especially cute asses.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.791
All right, I'll be there.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.609
I don't think he meant you.

03:39.628 --> 03:41.202
Uh, okay.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.371
(groans)
Got to get back to court.

03:43.465 --> 03:45.873
Trying a case,
and it might be a hung jury,

03:45.968 --> 03:47.634
but not the kind I like.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.228
(laughs):
Hung jury, that's funny.

03:49.379 --> 03:51.788
Okay, tone it down there,
Stretch.

03:52.624 --> 03:54.124
Well, I hope to see you all
tonight.

03:54.142 --> 03:55.625
KAT AND RANDI:
Bye.

03:55.644 --> 03:59.238
Damn, Phil, a hot younger man
who's also a lawyer?

03:59.389 --> 04:02.724
My boyfriend farts in the car
and locks the windows.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.801
(laughs) Hot box.

04:04.820 --> 04:06.486
(phone ringing)

04:06.580 --> 04:08.396
-Oh. My mother.
-No, don't answer it.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.064
-Don't.
-No, it could be
something important.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.084
Maybe she's calling
to tell me she's proud of me.

04:12.235 --> 04:14.828
It might be
something important.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.162
Hello.

04:16.315 --> 04:18.148
I lost my sunglasses
while we were out today.

04:18.241 --> 04:19.258
I need you to find them.

04:19.485 --> 04:21.075
M-Mother, I-I gave you
my whole morning.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.319
I have a life, too.

04:22.337 --> 04:25.155
Attagirl. Put it out
into the world,

04:25.157 --> 04:26.556
and it will come true.

04:27.843 --> 04:29.434
Please?

04:29.661 --> 04:30.677
(sighs)

04:30.938 --> 04:33.179
I suppose Max and I could
retrace our steps later.

04:33.348 --> 04:34.756
You're a dear,
I really appreciate this.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.776
Also, I need vodka.
Not that cheap stuff you like.

04:37.927 --> 04:39.427
Okay, bye.

04:40.339 --> 04:41.947
I thought
tonight was date night.

04:42.098 --> 04:43.840
We were gonna watch<i> Life of Pi.</i>

04:43.933 --> 04:45.342
It's about math.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.435
(chuckles) It's not about math.

04:47.529 --> 04:49.079
That's the boy's name.

04:50.699 --> 04:52.516
I hate this day.

04:52.609 --> 04:55.185
And then I said, "You can't
put that in my mouth."

04:55.278 --> 04:56.536
-Oh.
-(laughter)

04:56.705 --> 04:59.447
All right, baby,
I don't want you to get jealous,

04:59.541 --> 05:02.301
but gay guys got a queer eye
for this straight guy.

05:02.528 --> 05:04.210
What? That doesn't surprise me.

05:04.363 --> 05:06.138
You have the looks
of Michael B. Jordan

05:06.289 --> 05:08.473
and the arms of Michelle Obama.

05:08.625 --> 05:09.866
Hey, girl. (laughs)

05:10.035 --> 05:12.978
Where'd you buy those boobs?
I need to go shopping.

05:13.205 --> 05:15.555
(laughs):
Got her! They are big!

05:15.649 --> 05:17.298
I'm so sorry, honey.

05:17.318 --> 05:21.153
-You need to be this tall
to ride the ride.
-(laughs)

05:21.380 --> 05:22.562
But you are the perfect height
to service it.

05:22.714 --> 05:25.324
Oh! Well, I do got
the right tool for that job.

05:25.551 --> 05:28.234
-(laughter)
-All right, I'm next.

05:28.387 --> 05:30.070
Now, remember, no jealousy.

05:30.222 --> 05:32.238
Is it gonna be my hair, my body,

05:32.391 --> 05:35.292
my impossible-to-nail-down age?

05:37.396 --> 05:41.398
Oh, no, stop.
I am so jealous.

05:41.491 --> 05:44.584
Never in my 30 to 45 years
have I been ignored like that.

05:44.736 --> 05:45.677
(laughs)

05:46.572 --> 05:51.475
(gasps) Hey, guys, here she is,
Queen Dicktoria.

05:52.836 --> 05:54.744
-(chuckles): Oh.
-Uh-oh.

05:54.746 --> 05:57.263
It looks like
your queen has a lot of fans.

05:57.416 --> 06:00.567
Or are they waving at you,
Carter?

06:02.029 --> 06:05.680
Oh, no, I'm just a groupie.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.258
It's Elton John all over again.

06:08.351 --> 06:11.995
"Tiny Dancer," that was me.

06:14.433 --> 06:16.433
Hello, Mother,
we found your sunglasses.

06:16.451 --> 06:19.269
Oh, she must be asleep,
let's go get our math movie on.

06:19.287 --> 06:20.995
(whispers):
I have to pee.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.196
Pee in a bush.

06:22.290 --> 06:23.698
It's the only reason I came in.

06:23.867 --> 06:25.217
SHEILA:
Katharine, is that you?

06:25.444 --> 06:26.109
Yep.

06:26.202 --> 06:27.961
Oh, I thought I heard you.

06:28.113 --> 06:29.221
If you'd stuck with ballet,

06:29.372 --> 06:31.114
you wouldn't have
that plodding gait.

06:31.207 --> 06:32.632
She has fat feet.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.134
I have flat feet.

06:34.286 --> 06:35.727
-Both can be true.
-(Max chuckles)

06:35.879 --> 06:37.287
-We found your sunglasses.
-Oh.

06:37.347 --> 06:39.064
Yeah. They were not
at the doctor's office,

06:39.215 --> 06:42.383
so we also checked
the nail salon, the mall,

06:42.403 --> 06:44.736
the blow-dry bar,
and then I had Max drive,

06:44.888 --> 06:46.630
which turned out
to be a smart thing,

06:46.648 --> 06:48.314
because do you know
where I found your sunglasses?

06:48.467 --> 06:50.558
Katharine, just land the plane.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.318
Side pocket of
the passenger door.

06:52.395 --> 06:55.805
Did you try these on?
They seem bent.

06:55.974 --> 06:57.231
Max, let's go.

06:57.309 --> 06:59.476
Yoga's at 7:00 tomorrow,
be here by 6:30.

06:59.569 --> 07:03.163
What? No. No. I cannot
take you to yoga tomorrow.

07:03.315 --> 07:05.982
Well, if it's too much trouble
to help your mother,

07:06.075 --> 07:07.834
I understand.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.337
No, no, it's fine.
I'll-I'll be here at 6:30.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.432
Make it 6:15,
you'll have to parallel park,

07:13.659 --> 07:16.351
and I know you need
a couple shots at that.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.229
(Kat sighs)

07:22.517 --> 07:24.109
Sheila, yeah, maybe
you should try to find

07:24.260 --> 07:25.518
another way to get to yoga.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.261
I think Kat needs a break.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.172
Oh, you heard her, she's fine.

07:29.265 --> 07:30.431
I think she's just saying that

07:30.451 --> 07:31.858
'cause she doesn't want
to disappoint you.

07:32.027 --> 07:34.010
(scoffs) Since when?

07:34.103 --> 07:36.846
If she keeps having
to drop everything to help you,

07:37.015 --> 07:38.606
she's gonna crack.

07:39.868 --> 07:44.111
You have no idea how much
I hate depending on people.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.614
Yeah, that's got to be so hard.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.509
I can't even imag--
I'm sorry, I really got to pee.

07:56.960 --> 07:58.810
(laughter)

07:58.962 --> 08:00.220
I spent 15 minutes at the bar,

08:00.314 --> 08:01.721
and the only person
that talked to me said,

08:01.798 --> 08:03.540
"Are you the guy
who played Urkel?"

08:03.542 --> 08:05.892
(imitating Urkel):
I did not do that.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.894
Baby, settle down, it's okay.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.062
(regular voice):
It's not okay.

08:09.214 --> 08:10.322
I did 300 squats today.

08:10.473 --> 08:12.065
I mean, I came in here
dragging a wagon,

08:12.159 --> 08:13.733
and not one person
asked for a ride.

08:13.885 --> 08:16.553
DAME BOOTY CLENCH

09:23.121 --> 09:25.522
Suck it, hoes,
I'm her favorite.

09:28.402 --> 09:31.144
Whoa, how late were y'all out
last night?

09:31.296 --> 09:33.405
I got in at 4:00.

09:33.632 --> 09:36.441
Jalen's friends wanted
to go to a club after.

09:36.668 --> 09:39.911
-I'm gonna go lay down.
-Wait, in my bed?

09:40.063 --> 09:43.623
Don't worry, I'll keep
my drawers on this time.

09:46.144 --> 09:47.401
-Oh, no.
-Oh.

09:47.495 --> 09:49.979
-Hello, all.
-Morning, Sheila.

09:49.998 --> 09:54.075
If you're looking for Kat,
she's, uh, at the zoo.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.169
Yeah, yeah, she at the zoo.

09:56.321 --> 10:00.824
So, she didn't just duck behind
the counter when I came in?

10:00.826 --> 10:02.175
No. No duck.

10:02.327 --> 10:03.918
But you know
where there are ducks?

10:04.012 --> 10:06.646
At the zoo where she at.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.256
Well, if you see her,

10:09.351 --> 10:11.351
tell her that
I'm not going to ask her

10:11.427 --> 10:13.111
to do anything for me
anymore.

10:13.262 --> 10:15.338
-Hello, Mother.
-Oh.

10:15.340 --> 10:17.023
Why'd you say I was at the zoo?

10:17.175 --> 10:18.675
I was just...
I was just seeing

10:18.768 --> 10:21.119
if the, uh, counter is still
connected to the floor.

10:21.196 --> 10:24.122
Breaking news, it is. (laughs)

10:24.273 --> 10:25.865
Well, I have news, too.

10:26.017 --> 10:29.276
I found something that's gonna
make both of our lives easier.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.445
Just land the plane, Mother.

10:31.465 --> 10:36.468
I'm thinking of moving into
an active senior community.

10:36.695 --> 10:37.543
What?

10:37.638 --> 10:39.137
It's called Valley Hills.

10:39.364 --> 10:42.474
Imagine the Four Seasons
meets<i> Eyes Wide Shut</i>

10:42.625 --> 10:43.883
with dinner at 4:30.

10:44.035 --> 10:46.478
Ooh, how old do you have to be
to live there?

10:46.554 --> 10:48.313
What-what,
are you gonna sell the house?

10:48.464 --> 10:50.390
I'd have to.
I'm on a fixed income,

10:50.466 --> 10:52.542
and my only daughter
runs a business

10:52.560 --> 10:55.879
that's increasingly difficult
to explain.

10:55.972 --> 10:57.972
It's the cats.
Nobody gets the damn cats.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.807
Everybody loves the cats!

11:00.552 --> 11:03.477
Look, I-I know
I complained about yesterday,

11:03.497 --> 11:05.146
but I really don't mind
helping you out.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.056
But there's a lot of upsides
to this.

11:07.075 --> 11:09.984
They have a lovely spa,
three restaurants,

11:10.003 --> 11:12.837
and a complimentary shuttle
that doesn't whine

11:12.989 --> 11:15.489
if I want to stop at Pier 1.

11:15.509 --> 11:18.659
You don't need more wind chimes.

11:19.754 --> 11:21.754
Just, I can't believe
you're gonna sell the house.

11:21.831 --> 11:24.165
This is a lot to process
right now.

11:24.184 --> 11:28.061
Kat, we're out of conditioner.

11:30.932 --> 11:33.340
Ooh, if I prepay the first year,

11:33.360 --> 11:36.027
they'll throw in
the premium liquor package.

11:36.179 --> 11:37.420
(chuckles):
Oh, Valley Hills.

11:37.439 --> 11:40.590
I am about to wreck
your bottom line.

11:40.683 --> 11:43.943
You're not seriously
considering that dump, are you?

11:44.095 --> 11:45.278
I enjoyed the tour.

11:45.430 --> 11:46.946
And I can get
a room with a balcony,

11:47.098 --> 11:50.458
if Mr. Murray's heart surgery
doesn't go well.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.953
You are not gonna like it there.

11:54.105 --> 11:55.362
You're gonna end up in a room

11:55.382 --> 11:57.215
next to some guy
with an oxygen tank.

11:57.366 --> 11:58.791
You'll nickname him Wheezy.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.461
Then after one too many
at Merlot Monday,

12:01.613 --> 12:03.921
you'll be like, "Hey, Wheezy,
let's spark up a doobie."

12:04.148 --> 12:05.539
And then, boom.

12:05.633 --> 12:08.618
Wheezy's toupee lights up like
a menorah on the eighth night.

12:08.711 --> 12:11.378
I'm not befriending
anyone with a toupee,

12:11.398 --> 12:13.881
but the rest of that story
sounded fun.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.460
Yeah, fine. Sell the house,
move in there.

12:17.479 --> 12:19.220
But when you realize
that this was a huge mistake,

12:19.239 --> 12:21.573
you are not coming to live
with me.

12:21.724 --> 12:22.699
Promise?

12:23.559 --> 12:25.076
I-I'm serious.

12:25.228 --> 12:27.061
I think this is a bad idea.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.748
-You are gonna hate
being with all those old people.
-It's not your decision.

12:29.899 --> 12:34.085
I'm doing it, and I don't
really care if you approve.

12:34.237 --> 12:36.629
-Fine.
-Fine.

12:38.817 --> 12:41.651
Huh. Look at that. A Pier 1.

12:41.669 --> 12:43.678
(chuckles) Not gonna stop.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.508
-When were y'all gonna tell me?
-All right, all right.

12:48.660 --> 12:52.086
Al Roker didn't write you
that letter, I did.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.346
I'm talking about my body.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.774
I put on some pounds,
let myself go.

12:56.001 --> 12:57.517
Wait, you wrote that letter?

12:57.611 --> 13:00.019
So he's not coming here
to play pickleball with me?

13:01.022 --> 13:02.113
What are you talking about,
you put on pounds?

13:02.265 --> 13:04.532
I love your body.

13:06.361 --> 13:09.237
No, I'm doubling down,
I love your body.

13:10.532 --> 13:12.348
Wait, are you still mad
that a room full of gay men

13:12.441 --> 13:14.367
didn't sexually harass you?

13:14.461 --> 13:16.019
It makes no sense.

13:16.037 --> 13:18.187
My personality?
Sparkling.

13:18.281 --> 13:19.613
My hair? On point.

13:19.707 --> 13:23.209
My eyes? You need a lifeguard
or you'll drown in 'em.

13:23.303 --> 13:27.196
Your vanity? Astounding.
Your self-esteem? Misguided.

13:27.215 --> 13:29.474
She doesn't see what I see.

13:30.718 --> 13:35.555
Sorry, I overslept,
and I can't find my drawers.

13:35.707 --> 13:37.223
You go out again last night?

13:37.375 --> 13:40.376
Jalen and I closed down
a dueling piano bar.

13:40.395 --> 13:43.304
It was like yours, but
there were tons of people there.

13:43.398 --> 13:46.991
Could've just said
you went to a bar, man.

13:47.218 --> 13:48.809
-(beeping)
-What the hell?

13:48.829 --> 13:50.144
My brownies!

13:50.163 --> 13:52.997
Just so you know,
I see you, too.

14:01.733 --> 14:03.490
Oh, my poor brownies.

14:03.568 --> 14:07.570
And how in the world did
my drawers end up in the oven?

14:07.663 --> 14:09.347
I know you like Jalen,

14:09.498 --> 14:11.165
but you're gonna have
to take a night off.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.335
I can't. Jalen has
a lot of men after him.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.246
And if I'm not there,
he'll be hounded

14:17.265 --> 14:20.191
by that hussy
Allen from LensCrafters.

14:20.343 --> 14:22.343
Jalen will still like you

14:22.362 --> 14:24.270
if he finds out
your bedtime is 9:30.

14:24.422 --> 14:26.847
9:30? Maybe if I did cocaine.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.424
CARTER:
Hey, Randi, is this sexy?

14:28.517 --> 14:30.743
I want to take a picture
for Phil's friends.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.539
Chin up. Flex a little.

14:34.766 --> 14:35.707
No.

14:37.102 --> 14:38.859
I got you. I know your angles.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.503
(high-pitched scream)

14:42.123 --> 14:44.198
-(line rings, beeps)
<i> -Hey, it's Sheila.</i>

14:44.217 --> 14:45.958

14:46.111 --> 14:49.295
<i> -And stay frosty.</i>

14:49.447 --> 14:51.280
Hello, Mother,
this is Katharine.

14:51.299 --> 14:53.299
This is message number seven.

14:53.468 --> 14:55.727
Please listen to them in order.

14:55.878 --> 14:57.562
When you start
cleaning out my room,

14:57.789 --> 15:00.957
do not throw away
my Best at Algebra trophy

15:00.975 --> 15:03.292
or my Most Improved
Hall Monitor award.

15:03.311 --> 15:05.686
Cost me three weeks' allowance
to get those made.

15:05.813 --> 15:07.813
Don't forget
your homemade Grammy

15:07.966 --> 15:11.117
for your "Tattling
Gets a Bad Rap" rap.

15:12.061 --> 15:13.411

15:22.647 --> 15:26.841
Well, you know,
not bad for being dead.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.835
What's up with you, kiddo?

15:29.988 --> 15:31.504
Oh, a lot.

15:31.580 --> 15:33.080
I've got a boyfriend.

15:33.174 --> 15:35.082
The café's doing really well.

15:35.176 --> 15:36.267
Mom's selling the house

15:36.494 --> 15:38.327
'cause I didn't want
to take her to yoga.

15:38.346 --> 15:39.586
I know.

15:39.755 --> 15:41.422
You bought that house
when you guys got married.

15:41.516 --> 15:42.589
I grew up there.

15:42.684 --> 15:43.975
It was a great house.

15:44.127 --> 15:46.169
She says she wants to move
into a retirement home.

15:46.187 --> 15:49.021
Good news is, she'll get
that room with a balcony.

15:49.174 --> 15:51.616
I have inside information.

15:51.767 --> 15:53.117
You've got to stop her, Dad.

15:53.269 --> 15:55.269
Haunt the crap out of her.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.288
Let me ask you a question.

15:57.440 --> 16:00.441
Are you sure what you're
upset about is the house?

16:01.202 --> 16:02.609
Yeah, I don't want
her selling it.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.855
Plus, Mom doesn't belong
in a place like that,

16:05.948 --> 16:07.781
with all those old people.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.116
Kat.

16:09.210 --> 16:10.969
Your mother is getting older.

16:12.030 --> 16:13.137
And if you tell her I said that,

16:13.364 --> 16:15.531
I will haunt
the crap out of you.

16:15.624 --> 16:19.126
I just still see her
as the young, vibrant woman

16:19.220 --> 16:21.980
who packed cigarettes in my
lunch so I could make friends.

16:22.131 --> 16:24.465
(laughs) And then you turned her
in to the principal

16:24.559 --> 16:27.819
and gave yourself
a citizenship award.

16:28.046 --> 16:30.989
Just, those senior
communities are

16:31.140 --> 16:33.199
usually the last stop before...

16:34.327 --> 16:38.496
Just, I don't even want
to think about it.

16:40.575 --> 16:42.316
It's possible
you're not the only one

16:42.335 --> 16:44.711

16:46.914 --> 16:50.383
Yeah. You're right.

16:54.255 --> 16:56.556
Hey, you should be wearing

What are you doing here?

Oh, you, uh, left
your sunglasses in my car again.

17:37.481 --> 17:38.781
I was leaving them for you.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.967
Your big Charlie Brown head
stretched them out.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.120
What do we have here?

17:44.122 --> 17:45.788
(chuckles):
Oh, yep.

17:45.807 --> 17:48.140
You really stole the spotlight
at my bat mitzvah, didn't you?

17:48.293 --> 17:49.901
You started rapping.

17:50.052 --> 17:53.029
I had to show some skin
to distract people.

17:53.889 --> 17:54.572
(sighs)

17:54.799 --> 17:57.283
Look, I'm sorry about earlier.

17:58.561 --> 18:00.227
I got you this.

18:00.321 --> 18:04.731
Oh, Katharine,
that's so thoughtful.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.733
(chiming)

18:06.753 --> 18:07.977
Oh.

18:07.995 --> 18:09.812
They're for your new place.

18:09.831 --> 18:11.756
Thank you. (chuckles)

18:11.983 --> 18:14.317
Is the receipt in the bag?

18:14.335 --> 18:17.261
Look, if, if Valley Hills
is what you want,

18:17.488 --> 18:19.913
-I support you 100%.
-(scoffs)

18:19.933 --> 18:23.342
Of course it's not what I want.

18:23.494 --> 18:27.012
I wanted to grow old here
with my husband.

18:27.165 --> 18:29.014
I wanted to have perfect vision.

18:29.167 --> 18:32.335
I wanted to have
many grandbabies.

18:32.428 --> 18:35.780
I'm sorry things have not
worked out the way you planned.

18:35.931 --> 18:37.523
And you're right,
I have not given you

18:37.617 --> 18:38.858
any grandbabies yet,

18:38.952 --> 18:40.693
but I have given you
many grand-kittens.

18:40.845 --> 18:45.373
Oh, Katharine, you always know
the exact wrong thing to say.

18:47.443 --> 18:49.293
Wherever you go,

18:49.445 --> 18:52.755
whatever you need,
I'll be here.

18:53.875 --> 18:55.424
Thank you.

18:56.527 --> 18:59.971
I know I don't tell you this
enough,

19:00.198 --> 19:03.057
but I raised
a wonderful daughter.

19:08.206 --> 19:09.555
You know, um,

19:09.707 --> 19:12.558
Valley Hills is known for
its robust theater program.

19:12.710 --> 19:14.468
Maybe we could finally star
in<i> Gypsy.</i>

19:14.562 --> 19:18.447
Again,
the exact wrong thing to say.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.904
-Hey, everyone.
-Hi.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.055
-So glad you made it.
-Hey.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.907
-Oh, you look beautiful.
-Aw.

19:28.075 --> 19:29.483
I loved your song.

19:29.502 --> 19:34.005
I've never seen anybody twerk
to Sinatra before.

19:34.232 --> 19:36.248
Well, you know,
"I did it my way."

19:36.342 --> 19:37.842
(laughter)

19:37.993 --> 19:39.568
Phil, I need to talk to you.

19:39.587 --> 19:41.420
Oh, is that bitch Allen
from LensCrafters here?

19:41.589 --> 19:45.099
-You've seen his overbite,
haven't you?
-(chuckles)

19:47.261 --> 19:49.428
Listen, I got to be honest.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.747
Going out every night
is killing me.

19:51.840 --> 19:52.857
What?

19:52.934 --> 19:55.693
I know you're kind of
a party animal.

19:55.844 --> 20:00.089
(laughs):
Well, true dat, as you kids say.

20:00.107 --> 20:01.515
And Queen Dicktoria is, too,

20:01.534 --> 20:05.277
but, well, Jalen is more of
a homebody.

20:05.430 --> 20:07.446
His idea of a good time
is an Aperol Spritz

20:07.598 --> 20:09.615
and a couple episodes
of<i> Love Island.</i>

20:09.709 --> 20:13.544
(sighs)
Fake tans, real drama?

20:13.696 --> 20:15.104
Sign me up.

20:15.197 --> 20:17.606
Thank you for understanding.

20:17.775 --> 20:22.869
Please, I'd be happy
doing anything with you.

20:22.964 --> 20:24.472
Me, too.

20:29.971 --> 20:31.971
(giggles softly)

20:32.957 --> 20:36.809
Oh, girl, save some Botox
for the rest of us.

20:36.961 --> 20:38.236
I'm actually laughing.

20:38.387 --> 20:41.072
You just can't tell
because my eyebrows don't move.

20:41.299 --> 20:44.800
(laughs) Oh,
and who's this handsome devil?

20:44.893 --> 20:46.652
Me? I'm handsome?

20:46.804 --> 20:50.414
Is that your usual haircut
or are you just happy to see me?

20:50.566 --> 20:52.491
Aw, Dame Booty Clench,

20:52.643 --> 20:55.253
you just made
a young-to-middle-aged man's

20:55.480 --> 20:56.754
dream come true.

20:58.073 --> 20:59.482
And this one.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.677
Oh, whatever you're gonna
say, my mother's beat you to it.
