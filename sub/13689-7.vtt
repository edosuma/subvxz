{\an8}over--over Demi.

02:26.579 --> 02:28.748
{\an8}- Callum feels like
he's protective of the house,

02:28.815 --> 02:30.950
{\an8}<i>like he always has to</i>
<i>protect everyone.</i>

02:31.017 --> 02:32.919
{\an8}<i>and I feel like Callum</i>
<i>needs to learn</i>

02:32.986 --> 02:34.787
{\an8}<i>that you can't protect</i>
<i>everyone.</i>

02:34.854 --> 02:36.356
{\an8}They have to learn
by themselves.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.625
But Demi's gonna
decide what she wants.

02:38.691 --> 02:40.693
- Yeah, I mean,
it's hard not to

02:40.760 --> 02:43.530
{\an1}when, you know, you [bleep]--
when you care about someone

02:43.596 --> 02:44.797
{\an1}and when you're punching
holes in the walls

02:44.864 --> 02:46.666
{\an1}because you're so pissed off
that she, you know,

02:46.733 --> 02:48.735
{\an1}is probably gonna fall for
that [bleep], but you know...

02:48.801 --> 02:50.637

of our relationship.

a few days,

03:32.879 --> 03:34.147

- Yeah.

{\an7}- I really can't, like,
read you,

03:35.949 --> 03:37.784
{\an8}like I can't tell if

03:37.850 --> 03:39.819
{\an7}you're being serious
with me or not.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.721
{\an8}- I do like you, Allie,
I told you--

03:41.788 --> 03:44.090
{\an7}- Okay, all right, yeah,
but this is like the first time

03:44.157 --> 03:46.025
{\an7}you're kind of like...
telling me.

03:46.092 --> 03:48.861
{\an8}- I thought I was gonna get
a bit of hanky-panky with Allie

03:48.928 --> 03:50.863
{\an8}and then she started
gettin' all deep on me.

03:50.930 --> 03:52.899
{\an8}<i>Look, I've told the girl,</i>

03:52.966 --> 03:55.535

I do generally like her.

04:01.708 --> 04:04.043
{\an8}<i>She's talking so seriously,</i>

04:04.110 --> 04:06.646
{\an8}I've only got about two serious

04:08.781 --> 04:10.617

{\an3}"What did you say?"
I was like,

04:24.397 --> 04:26.132
{\an3}I literally said nothing

04:26.199 --> 04:27.400
{\an3}I had a little crush

04:27.467 --> 04:28.835
{\an3}I have like this much
of a crush.

04:28.901 --> 04:30.670
- On who?
- You.

04:30.737 --> 04:33.039
- You're gonna tell that girl
that your bull[bleep] upstairs

04:33.106 --> 04:35.208
that she's actually starting
to believe your [bleep].

04:35.274 --> 04:36.876
{\an3}- I'm very confused
on what you're talking about.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.578

04:40.213 --> 04:41.581
{\an1}I [bleep] know
that man.

04:41.648 --> 04:44.283
- Everything I said is,
like, 100%, so...

04:44.350 --> 04:45.785
{\an3}I don't wanna be
the reason why

04:45.852 --> 04:48.121
{\an3}I bring more bull[bleep]
to you, you know, [bleep]?

04:48.187 --> 04:50.490
And I'm not.

04:50.556 --> 04:53.126
{\an1}- But, yeah,
it's weird, it's weird.

04:53.192 --> 04:54.794
- It's weird and it's awkward.
- It's weird.

04:54.861 --> 04:57.930
{\an8}- It's a little bit [bleep]
how that first impression,

04:57.997 --> 04:59.565
{\an8}<i>that that one little tiny</i>
<i>conversation</i>

04:59.632 --> 05:01.334
{\an8}<i>with Sam went off.</i>

05:01.401 --> 05:02.735
{\an8}Callum [bleep]
created a ruckus.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.370
{\an8}Now I look like
the drama of the house.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.539
<i>Sam's not gonna want to</i>
<i>come [bleep] with me anymore.</i>

05:06.606 --> 05:08.274
{\an1}- But I get people are
obviously protective of you.

05:08.341 --> 05:10.476
- But I felt like
they were looking for

05:10.543 --> 05:12.445
any slight reason on you...

05:12.512 --> 05:13.913
- Yeah.
- For an argument.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.416
And that was the start of it.
- Mm.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.583
{\an8}So La Demi actually told me

05:17.650 --> 05:19.886
{\an8}she's got a bit
of a crush on me.

05:19.952 --> 05:22.789

<i>I want to find the best</i>

05:26.759 --> 05:29.028
{\an3}- I'm just done
taking sides, I'm like

05:29.095 --> 05:31.197
I want to hang out and vibe

05:31.264 --> 05:33.700
{\an3}without all the bull[bleep]
brought to my attention.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.868

getting

05:45.578 --> 05:46.879
all [bleep] serious on me.

05:46.946 --> 05:48.648
She was like--
she was like,

"You know what,
I do actually like ya.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.785
I don't want you
to hurt me."

05:52.852 --> 05:54.787
We've had the serious
conversation

05:54.854 --> 05:56.723
and she's like,
"Oh, I'm glad we had it,"

05:56.789 --> 05:58.291
but [bleep] me, right?
I don't wanna have it

05:58.357 --> 06:00.059

- Right.

votin' to get me home.

26:24.249 --> 26:27.052

Do I regret taking it that far

26:33.892 --> 26:35.760

put me on the chopping block.

26:47.405 --> 26:49.441

it had to be done

26:49.507 --> 26:51.977
{\an8}and let's just move on
from it if you want to.

I was just like, man, come on.

any connections.

37:08.793 --> 37:10.494
