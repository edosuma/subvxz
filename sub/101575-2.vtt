00:12.012 --> 00:14.222
[Burnham] <i>Previously on</i>
Star Trek: Discovery:

00:14.305 --> 00:16.766
[woman] <i>Attention, all vessels.</i>
<i>Leland's fleet has arrived.</i>

00:16.850 --> 00:20.812
Control will not stop coming.
Eventually, Leland will find you.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.610
[Leland] <i>Last warning.</i>
<i>Transmit the data to me...</i>

00:28.153 --> 00:29.404
<i>or you will be destroyed.</i>

00:29.487 --> 00:32.073
The Sphere's data has already merged
with <i>Discovery.</i>

00:32.157 --> 00:36.161
As long as <i>Discovery </i>exists here and now,
this will never be over.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.039
<i>Discovery</i> has to go to the future.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.624
Commander Burnham will use
the suit to open a wormhole.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.543
<i>Discovery </i>will be on autopilot behind her.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.129
[Tilly] We are here
because we're staying with you.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.756
But I don't know what the future holds.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.924
It is done, Michael.
And we are running out of time.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.634
[weapons firing]

00:51.718 --> 00:55.889
[Stamets] The housing is prepped.
I need that last panel!

00:56.639 --> 00:58.475
[grunting]

01:00.018 --> 01:02.103
[Nilsson] Oh, my God. No, no, no.

01:02.187 --> 01:06.483
Paul, your injuries are pretty severe.
I'm gonna induce coma.

01:06.566 --> 01:07.984
-[groans]
-You'll be fine!

01:11.529 --> 01:14.616
This does not end here.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.409
Actually, it does.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.869
No!

01:19.871 --> 01:21.873
Commander Burnham, on your mark.

01:21.956 --> 01:25.460
Burnham to <i>Discovery.</i> Let's go.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.798
Lieutenant Detmer, full power.
Follow our signal.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.550
[engine whirring]

02:07.710 --> 02:09.712
[rumbling]

02:17.137 --> 02:19.556
[alarm wailing]

02:34.362 --> 02:35.446
Back to stations!

02:38.575 --> 02:39.826
[Saru] Lieutenant Detmer!

02:39.909 --> 02:41.744
Everyone! Everyone, back to stations now!

02:41.828 --> 02:43.913
[explosion]

02:48.459 --> 02:50.545
Feels like my head is in a vice.

02:50.628 --> 02:54.424
Tidal forces from the wormhole.
Like G-forces but nastier.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.468
Must have knocked us all out,
including my damn back.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.475
Commander, I can't get control.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.935
Shields are collapsing.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.145
Injuries on multiple decks.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.480
Sensors are not responding, sir.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.441
-Critical systems failing.
-Detmer!

03:11.524 --> 03:12.984
Sir, <i>Discovery </i>is unresponsive.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.736
Rerouting to gain control.

03:17.822 --> 03:18.698
Brace!

03:18.781 --> 03:20.491
-Brace! Brace!
-Brace! Brace!

03:37.884 --> 03:39.969
We'll disintegrate in 15 seconds
at current velocity.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.014
I've got minimal controls
back online, sir.

03:43.097 --> 03:44.724
Recommendation, lieutenant?

03:44.807 --> 03:45.767
A thermal roll.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.144
Let the top of the shields
take some of the brunt.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.312
Quickly, please.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.521
Go hard.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.200
[Saru] A glacier?

04:02.283 --> 04:05.119
I need the spot with the highest thickness
and density levels.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.872
-On it.
-Ready the graviton beam.

04:07.956 --> 04:11.000
Activate deflector shields in bursts
to cushion our landing. On my mark.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.085
[all] Aye, commander.

04:12.168 --> 04:15.338
Up five degrees from port side,
ice is 50 meters thick.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.006
-Copy.
-Is that deep enough?

04:17.090 --> 04:19.342
-We're gonna find out.
-This is Commander Saru.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.094
All decks prepare for impact.

04:31.562 --> 04:32.772
Rhys, fire now!

04:38.736 --> 04:40.280
Deflector shields are offline.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.823
Hold us steady, lieutenant!

04:50.164 --> 04:51.332
[grunting]

06:31.557 --> 06:34.185
[panting]

06:56.165 --> 06:57.166
[gasps]

06:57.583 --> 06:59.585
Whoo!

07:00.253 --> 07:01.129
[Reno] All right!

07:01.212 --> 07:02.964
-[Bryce] Oh, yeah! Detmer!
-Yeah.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.178
Well done, Lieutenant Detmer.

07:09.262 --> 07:13.724
Someone buy that woman a drink.
And a neuroblocker for me.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.227
Keyla?

07:16.310 --> 07:17.311
Yeah?

07:17.395 --> 07:18.312
We made it.

07:19.730 --> 07:20.982
[laughs]

07:21.983 --> 07:22.900
We're good.

07:27.029 --> 07:27.905
Yeah.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.700
You need to go to sickbay.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.035
[grunts] No, it's nothing.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.706
Your comrade is correct, lieutenant.
Get to sickbay.

07:37.373 --> 07:38.374
Yes, sir.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.303
Status reports?

07:50.386 --> 07:51.804
Tactical systems are down.

07:51.888 --> 07:55.308
As are long-range comms
and all in-ship communications, commander.

07:55.391 --> 07:56.809
Sensors are not responding.

07:56.893 --> 08:01.230
We don't know where we are,
and we don't know when we are, sir.

08:01.731 --> 08:04.901
My back might be short-circuiting
my brain right now,

08:04.984 --> 08:09.989
but I don't recall Terralysium
being particularly icy.

08:10.781 --> 08:13.784
Can you speculate on the cause
of the systems outage?

08:13.868 --> 08:18.498
Based on how hard we hit,
probably a plasma-manifold rupture.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.792
We'll have to find and fix
all of the blown EPS relays

08:21.876 --> 08:26.214
and conduits on the ship before
we can go anywhere. We can't fly.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.218
We can't call for help.
We can't call Michael.

08:31.552 --> 08:32.887
She's alone.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.891
We are completely disconnected
at present, yes.

08:36.974 --> 08:43.272
But we are also together and alive.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.400
If Commander Burnham landed elsewhere,

08:46.484 --> 08:49.403
I trust she is aware that we will find her
as soon as we are able.

08:50.071 --> 08:53.574
Begin a search for the affected relays
and conduits.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.494
Inform all you come in contact with
to do the same.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.079
Crew members are to work in pairs

08:58.162 --> 09:00.748
until internal communications
are reestablished.

09:00.831 --> 09:03.834
Commander, we can't locate the problems
without internal sensors.

09:03.918 --> 09:07.046
I can modify the tricorders,
like I did on the <i>Hiawatha</i>.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.298
I will survey the damage in person.

09:09.799 --> 09:10.716
And...

09:12.510 --> 09:16.806
I am aware that you all may feel
an expedited need to see

09:16.889 --> 09:19.183
and understand what is out there.

09:20.351 --> 09:24.480
But our first priority is in here.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.567
The integrity of this ship and this crew.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.611
-Am I clear?
-[all] Aye, sir.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.407
Lieutenant Rhys, you have the conn.
Ensign, with me.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.997
[electricity crackling]

09:41.080 --> 09:43.624
Coming through, coming through.
On your right.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.253
[Tilly] It's, uh-- It's odd.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.964
There are, uh, excuse me, large pockets,

09:50.047 --> 09:52.550
on the surface where the atmosphere
has higher levels of oxygen

09:52.633 --> 09:54.051
than the rest of the planet.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.762
Is there any discernible pattern?
A design?

09:56.846 --> 10:00.349
Yes, sir.
Each pocket is essentially a decagon.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.810
It would indicate to me
that someone made them.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.896
And I know, but it's its only explanation.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.691
Then we are not on Terralysium.

10:09.859 --> 10:10.693
No, sir.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.155
Um, but there is evidence
of an active settlement

10:14.238 --> 10:15.823
in one of these pockets so there--

10:17.825 --> 10:18.701
There's life.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.289
There is... life?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.339
How long for repairs, Mr. Bryce?

10:33.257 --> 10:34.925
Well, it's not a repair, sir.

10:35.051 --> 10:39.055
For this particular transtator,
it's a complete rebuild.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.806
Six hours minimum.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.059
Assuming we have enough rubindium.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.895
So no communications until then.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.688
[squeaking]

10:49.273 --> 10:52.860
Um, you have some, uh,
Leland on your shoes.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.695
Somebody had to make sure he was dead.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.782
And someone else needs
to clean the spore cube.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.617
There's gooey bits of him everywhere. You!

11:00.368 --> 11:03.412
Did I hear you say
we still have no communications?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.330
Uh...

11:05.206 --> 11:08.292
He will complete repairs as soon
as he is able, commander.

11:09.001 --> 11:12.672
All available hands
are busy repairing the EPS grid.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.216
-Do you require medical attention?
-Of course not.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.509
We can spare one engineer.

11:16.592 --> 11:17.885
Ah.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.389
I have no desire to leave
Commander Burnham on her own.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.767
But we must get all systems up and running
as quickly as possible.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.770
Wherever we have arrived,
we are strangers,

11:28.104 --> 11:29.772
and we cannot assume that we are welcome.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.441
-Carry on, Mr. Bryce.
-Yes, sir.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.320
Oh, commander!

11:36.862 --> 11:37.696
Excuse me.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.297
[footsteps approaching]

12:01.971 --> 12:04.390
-[man] <i>Elevate pressure.</i>
-[Culber] Paul?

12:04.974 --> 12:06.725
<i>-Paul.</i>
-[woman] <i>Doctor, Paul!</i>

12:06.809 --> 12:08.227
[Culber] I know, I know.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.694
I'm gonna induce coma. You'll be fine.

12:18.612 --> 12:19.447
Where...?

12:19.780 --> 12:21.490
-[Culber] Can you hear me?
-Hm?

12:22.575 --> 12:24.076
Follow my fingers.

12:27.037 --> 12:27.872
Good. Good.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.207
We made it through.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.334
It was a pretty rough landing.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.253
And I wouldn't have brought you
out so soon,

12:34.670 --> 12:36.630
but there are some people
in really bad shape.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.216
We need your biobed.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.302
Worse than me?

12:42.761 --> 12:43.596
Yeah.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.934
-When are we?
-We don't know when we are.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.312
Sensors are down, comms are down.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.565
As soon as I have an answer,
I'll let you know, okay?

12:55.524 --> 12:58.110
Gonna take you to
the cellular regeneration chamber.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.528
You should be good in a few days.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.072
-I'm good now.
-No. No, you're not.

13:02.948 --> 13:03.991
Take it slow.

13:05.034 --> 13:09.413
The-- The plasma manifold? The EPS grid?

13:09.497 --> 13:11.916
-It's being handled.
-They'll need all the help they can get.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.877
I'll tell you what,
I'll let you go to work if you can spell:

13:14.960 --> 13:18.005
"my partner brought me out of a coma
and all I got was this lousy T-shirt."

13:19.048 --> 13:19.882
Spell it.

13:22.009 --> 13:22.927
My brain.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.720
Yes, it's scrambled like an egg.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.597
Come on. Slow.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.974
[groans]

13:33.354 --> 13:36.232
[Stamets] L-O-U-S-Y

13:36.690 --> 13:38.275
T-S-H-I-R-T.

13:39.401 --> 13:41.153
[Culber] "T-shirt" has a hyphen.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.114
Cellular regeneration is the only way
we'll get you

13:44.198 --> 13:46.075
even moderately functional today.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.660
One full cycle minimum.

13:47.743 --> 13:50.246
Five cycles,
if you wanna finish healing that scar.

13:52.122 --> 13:55.292
-Ow, are you punishing me?
-Yes.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.794
And I love you.

13:56.877 --> 13:59.838
And that was a neuroblocker
to help with the pain, so you're welcome.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.550
And if you don't stay in for a full cycle
before doing anything else,

14:02.633 --> 14:04.677
I'll have Saru ground you. Understood?

14:05.177 --> 14:06.053
Understood.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.183
It's good to have you back.

14:13.769 --> 14:14.937
It's good to have you alive.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.984
Mm-hm. All right.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.161
-He didn't make it?
-No.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.873
[telepathically]
<i>Your neurological tests are clear.</i>

14:33.956 --> 14:36.250
<i>No concussion. You're good to go.</i>

14:37.710 --> 14:38.544
What?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.421
I said you're good to go.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.298
Is there something else?

14:44.758 --> 14:45.593
No.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.303
Thanks.

15:06.488 --> 15:07.698
[Georgiou] Why is this here?

15:07.781 --> 15:10.159
Shouldn't what's-his-name
be building the new assembly?

15:10.242 --> 15:11.827
We don't have enough rubindium onboard.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.787
No transtator means no communication,

15:13.871 --> 15:15.581
not within the ship,
not outside of the ship,

15:15.664 --> 15:17.499
and not to Michael, wherever she is.

15:17.833 --> 15:21.045
Scans show that the settlement
has a natural supply of rubindium,

15:21.128 --> 15:22.630
as well as several other minerals,

15:22.713 --> 15:24.798
most of which
I can't even begin to identify.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.009
[Georgiou] Looks like the future
has brought us

15:27.092 --> 15:29.345
an entirely new elemental table.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.264
I think there's enough able-bodied
to pull together a recon team.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.977
Are there other relevant details
you've gathered thus far?

15:37.061 --> 15:38.562
Not much. Um...

15:38.646 --> 15:40.648
I have a lot of information
about this planet,

15:40.731 --> 15:43.025
but I don't know which planet we're on.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.402
This is like reading
an obituary backwards.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.529
The settlement only has 50 life signs,

15:47.613 --> 15:51.700
but they have ships whose design
would presume warp capability...

15:52.785 --> 15:54.578
but I haven't gotten
any dilithium readings.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.830
So, they can't possibly fly them.

15:57.414 --> 16:02.211
I don't understand, but they have warp
and they have ships, so that's-- Uh...

16:02.294 --> 16:04.880
That's one... common-- Um...

16:05.965 --> 16:08.175
-Mutual--
-Should we get the training manual?

16:08.258 --> 16:10.636
Or can you find your own way
to making a point?

16:10.719 --> 16:12.721
-Commander.
-We need to fix communications,

16:12.805 --> 16:14.473
and time is of the essence.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.892
We are all acutely aware of that.

16:19.478 --> 16:23.107
We will acquire what we need to repair
our transtator as quickly as possible.

16:23.691 --> 16:27.319
And we will reveal as little of ourselves
as possible in the process.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.239
They have an artificial atmosphere, Saru.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.200
These are not Kelpiens
who have never seen a starship.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.664
They have 930 years on us.
Why hide from them?

16:38.747 --> 16:41.542
Assuming we arrived in the correct time,

16:42.167 --> 16:47.047
we carry with us a knowledge of certain
past events that we cannot share,

16:47.131 --> 16:51.343
lest we impact the present or future
of any society with which we interact.

16:51.427 --> 16:56.598
Whether or not the local population
is more or less advanced is immaterial.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.059
We will adhere
to their cultural standards.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.352
We will barter peacefully.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.272
We crash landed, and we're going in blind.

17:03.355 --> 17:07.609
The chances that they greet us peacefully
are preposterously low.

17:08.193 --> 17:11.071
We will not abandon what we believe.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.783
If this were my planet,
I'd already have us surrounded,

17:14.867 --> 17:16.535
weapons drawn.

17:16.618 --> 17:19.580
I am not asking you
to participate, commander.

17:20.247 --> 17:23.917
I am telling you what we will do
in your absence.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.212
Ensign Tilly, you will join me.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.422
-Me?
-Her?

17:30.507 --> 17:32.593
[Georgiou]
Are you trying to get us all slaughtered?

17:32.676 --> 17:35.971
She has as much
psychic dominance as a kitten.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.514
Okay, what the--?!

17:38.348 --> 17:39.391
Report to sickbay.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.935
We will have Dr. Pollard
administer appropriate treatment

17:42.019 --> 17:44.897
so that we may breathe naturally
in this atmosphere.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.859
Commander Nhan, I'm placing you
in charge of the ship's repairs.

17:49.568 --> 17:53.238
And I need you to assist
in the repair of the EPS grid.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.492
If we can't fly
to Commander Burnham's location,

17:56.575 --> 17:57.618
we are of no use to her.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.039
You are dismissed.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.388
[groaning]

18:21.558 --> 18:23.602
How many drugs are you on right now?

18:23.685 --> 18:25.938
I'm just moving a little slowly.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.358
As a person in great pain would move.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.985
As I know all too well.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.823
Let me take a wild guess,
you didn't find what you were looking for

18:35.906 --> 18:40.160
and are now wondering if maybe
the problem's in the Jefferies tubes?

18:40.244 --> 18:43.080
Why are you talking to me
as if we're working on this together?

18:43.163 --> 18:45.582
-Because that's exactly what's happening.
-Absolutely not.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.626
Saru wants us working on teams,

18:47.709 --> 18:49.711
and apparently, if you can breathe,
you can work.

18:49.795 --> 18:54.967
So, unless Hazmat over here is gonna be
helping after he cleans up Aisle 5--

18:55.050 --> 18:56.510
My name's Gene.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.804
-I've already forgotten that.
-I don't need--

18:59.304 --> 19:02.057
I've already determined
the location of the ruptured relay.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.559
Great. Let's go.

19:03.892 --> 19:06.645
That wasn't an invitation.
I can do this on my own.

19:06.728 --> 19:09.982
Fine. Then I'll just follow you
for the witty repartee.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.925
[Tilly] Nobody's ever been here before.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.718
No one's ever...

20:21.011 --> 20:22.763
had to say what this is like...

20:24.306 --> 20:26.808
or what this feels like. It's just--

20:27.100 --> 20:28.393
It's so weird.

20:29.895 --> 20:34.024
I mean, there's a giant hunk of planet
hanging there in the sky.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.570
Wish we had the time to figure out
how all this works.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.242
Sorry, sir.
I'm talking because I'm scared.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.368
I know.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.329
Keep talking, ensign.

20:47.746 --> 20:52.793
You know, on the ship,
I said the scans were odd or strange,

20:52.876 --> 20:54.628
but it's not true, it's--

20:54.711 --> 20:56.088
We're odd and strange.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.173
Not to each other.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.385
Thank you for asking me
to accompany you, sir.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.222
Why did you ask me to accompany you, sir?

21:05.305 --> 21:06.974
I needed an engineer.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.517
The ship's full of engineers.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.269
Georgiou's an engineer.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.895
An engineer I could trust.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.647
She thinks I'm useless.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.232
She's concerned for Michael

21:15.315 --> 21:18.944
and lacks the self-awareness
to control her behavior

21:19.027 --> 21:20.862
in such an unsettled state.

21:21.822 --> 21:24.408
We are introducing ourselves
to the future.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.161
You, Ensign Tilly,

21:29.121 --> 21:31.039
are a wonderful first impression.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.213
[sniffs]

21:54.271 --> 21:55.731
First contact.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.201
[Nhan] It's parasitic ice of some kind.

22:10.245 --> 22:12.497
Nilsson and her team
were trying to figure it out.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.875
So far, we know
it accelerates in the shade.

22:14.958 --> 22:17.294
So, when the sun goes down, we're screwed.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.796
All the more reason
to get off this piece of rock

22:19.880 --> 22:22.007
before we're entombed like wooly mammoths.

22:22.090 --> 22:23.800
[hull creaking]

22:23.884 --> 22:25.844
Oh, well, that's a fun new sound.

22:27.554 --> 22:29.890
All relays and conduits
are clear on Deck 4.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.641
We could use some help on Deck 8.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.853
What the hell are you doing here
besides saving their asses?

22:34.936 --> 22:36.396
Saving your ass.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.481
You're welcome.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.316
I don't do gratitude.

22:39.399 --> 22:41.276
You could've stayed on the <i>Enterprise</i>

22:41.359 --> 22:43.278
and remained in the time
you were meant to be in,

22:43.361 --> 22:46.239
if you believe in that kind of thing,
which I don't.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.283
I stayed for Airiam.

22:49.576 --> 22:52.913
She was a science officer,
but she paid the price of a soldier.

22:53.413 --> 22:56.166
I felt like someone should honor that.
A life for a life, you know?

22:56.541 --> 22:59.544
I do.
What an unbelievably shitty decision.

23:00.253 --> 23:02.589
Says the woman who's still here.

23:04.049 --> 23:07.427
Section 31 would have begged me
to take over sooner or later,

23:07.511 --> 23:10.180
and bureaucracy is where fun goes to die.

23:10.263 --> 23:13.391
I like jumping from universe to universe.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.187
Commander.

23:17.604 --> 23:20.565
The EPS grid is functional on Deck 6.

23:22.692 --> 23:23.610
Hello, Georgiou.

23:24.361 --> 23:27.489
You must have an enormous
visible spectrum.

23:27.572 --> 23:30.700
Hm, 74,000 nanometers.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.119
We should talk.

23:32.410 --> 23:34.830
Report to Deck 8, Linus.

23:34.913 --> 23:35.747
They could use help.

23:37.415 --> 23:38.500
I'll join him.

23:39.417 --> 23:40.710
See you later.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.728
Those are blast marks on those rigs.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.106
Somebody wanted to shut this place down.

24:01.189 --> 24:02.399
So it would appear.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.110
Not to state the obvious, sir,
but it occurs to me

24:05.193 --> 24:07.404
that the somebody we're following

24:07.487 --> 24:10.365
could be the same somebody
who wanted to shut this place down.

24:10.448 --> 24:12.075
Could be a different somebody,

24:12.784 --> 24:15.370
but if it's not,
then we would be walking into...

24:16.413 --> 24:17.664
a trap.

24:18.165 --> 24:18.999
Maybe?

24:19.749 --> 24:22.794
I would never expect any of my crew
to not have fear.

24:23.837 --> 24:25.797
But I will ask you to contain it now.

24:26.339 --> 24:27.382
Are you with me, ensign?

24:36.808 --> 24:37.934
[Tilly] Hundred percent, sir.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.383
Greetings.

25:52.133 --> 25:53.176
We mean no harm.

25:54.302 --> 25:57.013
-Our ship crashed.
-A Starfleet ship. We know.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.765
So much for not giving ourselves away.

25:58.848 --> 26:01.101
Who are you and what do you want?

26:01.184 --> 26:02.560
I am Saru.

26:03.186 --> 26:04.271
This is Tilly.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.191
-My name lacks authority.
-What?

26:08.275 --> 26:11.152
-What?
-We are officers of Starfleet.

26:12.821 --> 26:13.905
Prove it.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.408
You have already identified our ship.

26:16.491 --> 26:18.368
Anyone could be flying that ship.

26:19.703 --> 26:22.664
Starfleet regulation 256.15,

26:23.248 --> 26:26.501
officers shall display behavior
befitting an officer at all times.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.462
Which is why we're not
freaking out right now

26:29.546 --> 26:31.673
by being held at Phaser-point
by a bunch of strangers.

26:32.299 --> 26:36.052
It's actually really scary,
so can you please lower your weapons,

26:36.970 --> 26:39.848
or I don't know, tell us your names,
so one of those things isn't true?

26:43.685 --> 26:44.853
[weapon powers down]

26:45.854 --> 26:47.230
[weapons power down]

26:48.189 --> 26:49.149
My name is Kal.

26:50.692 --> 26:51.693
[weapon powers down]

26:51.776 --> 26:53.737
-I told you.
-They can't help us, Kal.

26:53.820 --> 26:56.114
Yes, they can, and they will.

26:57.198 --> 26:59.909
It's a part of them, how they are.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.790
Friends, our navigation system is damaged.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.167
What planet are we on?

27:08.084 --> 27:09.544
It's never had a proper name.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.838
We call our home The Colony.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.758
We're miners. Many of us, Coridan.

27:14.841 --> 27:17.469
Please, Kal,
Zareh will have tracked them here.

27:17.552 --> 27:19.054
-I know.
-Who is Zareh?

27:19.763 --> 27:20.722
[Kal] Can your ship fly?

27:20.805 --> 27:22.474
Do you have a weapons system?

27:22.557 --> 27:24.559
[Saru] We are a science vessel.

27:24.642 --> 27:27.103
A piece of our communications equipment
is damaged.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.481
Kal. They have to go.

27:29.564 --> 27:30.565
Who is Zareh?

27:37.864 --> 27:38.698
We have dilithium.

27:39.699 --> 27:41.868
We do. We can help you.

27:41.951 --> 27:43.536
We can help each other.

27:45.080 --> 27:45.997
I told you.

27:46.873 --> 27:49.918
-How much dilithium?
-Sufficient to power your vessels.

27:50.001 --> 27:53.171
We need more.
And extra to sell at the exchange.

27:53.254 --> 27:56.341
And we have to fix our equipment as well.

27:56.966 --> 27:59.052
I am confident that we can come
to an agreement.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.556
Give it to me. We have to hurry.

28:09.020 --> 28:13.733
[Stamets] The blown relay can be accessed
via the junction point five meters up,

28:14.317 --> 28:16.986
and then it's located 11 meters in.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.530
Should be an easy fix.

28:18.613 --> 28:20.448
Great. Let me know if you need any help.

28:21.157 --> 28:23.868
I need you to access the blown relay.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.204
Sorry, sunshine, spine says no.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.705
[hull groans]

28:29.833 --> 28:32.252
So, what, you're just gonna sit there?

28:32.335 --> 28:34.379
I'm offering moral support.

28:34.462 --> 28:36.256
And you're in great shape, right?

28:36.339 --> 28:40.927
I mean, for two hours I've just heard
about how pain is not in your vocabulary.

28:42.720 --> 28:43.763
Fine. I'm...

28:44.806 --> 28:46.725
experiencing some discomfort.

28:46.808 --> 28:51.312
Yeah, you were impaled
by a 7-inch shard of duranium alloy.

28:51.604 --> 28:52.981
And put in a coma.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.817
Helpless is a shitty feeling,

28:55.900 --> 28:59.571
but it is not forever,
and it doesn't make you any less capable.

29:00.655 --> 29:04.701
Do us both a favor and just admit
that you're not bringing your A game.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.328
Let's get Nilsson up there.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.913
I'm sure she can do it.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.082
No.

29:11.791 --> 29:12.625
I'm good.

29:13.251 --> 29:14.335
I've got this.

29:20.675 --> 29:23.219
[Kal] I have never
seen anything like this.

29:24.679 --> 29:26.347
How old is your starship?

29:26.765 --> 29:29.476
[Tilly] Oh, we like to think of her
as a classic, so...

29:32.187 --> 29:34.230
[device powering up]

29:35.148 --> 29:36.357
Is this your repair kit?

29:42.864 --> 29:43.865
Whoa.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.868
I've never seen rubindium do that.

29:48.828 --> 29:50.830
This is programmable matter.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.582
Yeah, no. No, I know.

29:52.665 --> 29:54.209
That was a quiz. You passed.

29:56.211 --> 29:59.881
Luckily, my repair database has equipment

29:59.964 --> 30:02.550
with similar functionality
to your transtator.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.595
Otherwise, I couldn't have helped.

30:06.095 --> 30:09.641
Can't bake a peach pie
with a gazpacho recipe, right?

30:12.227 --> 30:14.854
Oh, that's something
my grandma used to say.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.691
You're really adept at that, wow.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.446
Maybe I'm Starfleet material.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.742
[chuckles]

30:30.286 --> 30:32.288
I just always believed you would come.

30:35.124 --> 30:35.959
And you did.

30:36.876 --> 30:37.710
So...

30:41.339 --> 30:43.007
-Been a long time, huh?
-Yeah.

30:43.842 --> 30:47.262
But once we're self-sufficient again,
we can defend ourselves.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.222
Why did nobody try until now?

30:50.890 --> 30:52.058
My brothers tried.

30:54.686 --> 30:59.399
Might I inquire as to why this Zareh
inspires such fear?

30:59.482 --> 31:02.569
Might I inquire how you managed to avoid
finding that out for yourself?

31:02.652 --> 31:05.405
As I said, we have been adrift
for quite some time.

31:05.488 --> 31:08.449
Yeah. Well, you should've stayed adrift.
You're just gonna make things worse.

31:09.576 --> 31:11.077
Zareh's our courier.

31:11.160 --> 31:14.372
He delivers what we can't make or grow,
which is pretty much everything.

31:14.455 --> 31:17.375
And you have no dilithium to gather
what you need for yourselves.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.879
How long has he exploited your community?

31:20.962 --> 31:22.589
Since he blasted our equipment,

31:22.672 --> 31:25.300
decapitated the last courier,
and took the route for himself.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.176
And the Federation has not intervened?

31:28.261 --> 31:29.262
[aircraft whirring]

31:29.345 --> 31:30.722
Where are you from?

31:30.805 --> 31:33.016
[rumbling]

31:37.896 --> 31:38.980
Here we go!

31:39.772 --> 31:41.649
You have to go now. Out the back.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.444
But we've not held up
our end of the deal, your dilithium.

31:44.527 --> 31:47.155
It won't matter if we're all dead.
Please, go!

32:12.013 --> 32:13.765
[Zareh] You must be our friends

32:14.432 --> 32:16.142
from the <i>U.S.S. Discovery.</i>

32:18.061 --> 32:19.854
Hello, Kal. How's the family?

32:23.399 --> 32:27.362
There was no trace of your vessel
in our databases.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.113
We are an older model.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.907
Aren't we all?

32:30.990 --> 32:33.242
They've been in contact
with other Federation ships...

32:34.077 --> 32:35.370
who know where they are.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.582
They've been adrift for a long time.

32:39.666 --> 32:42.919
Kal, this is more
than I've heard you speak

32:43.002 --> 32:44.337
since I've known you.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.132
Our visitors must be having...

32:50.009 --> 32:51.761
a garrulous effect.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.349
Must've been very disorienting for you,

32:57.308 --> 32:58.434
being adrift.

32:58.893 --> 33:00.603
-I'm good.
-[Zareh] Good.

33:01.020 --> 33:04.107
We did, however,
register a freaky signature

33:04.649 --> 33:06.150
right before you got here.

33:06.234 --> 33:08.152
High-energy gamma rays

33:08.653 --> 33:10.697
and gravitational waves.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.657
Do you know how those show up?

33:13.408 --> 33:14.909
Why those show up?

33:14.993 --> 33:16.369
I bet you do.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.621
You look so smart.

33:19.247 --> 33:20.206
Say it.

33:20.289 --> 33:22.792
Our mission is not of your concern.

33:22.875 --> 33:23.835
Okay.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.338
Get them a drink. Put it in a flask.

33:28.798 --> 33:31.426
-We can drink as we walk.
-Where are you taking them?

33:32.802 --> 33:35.138
Really, Kal?
Now you need to shut the hell up.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.765
They're taking me to their ship.

33:39.142 --> 33:39.976
No.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.062
It wasn't a question, it was a statement.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.523
There's no implied choice.

33:51.821 --> 33:54.574
What is that you're hiding
behind your back, sweetheart?

34:06.002 --> 34:07.086
Ah.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.632
So, if they crashed and they needed you

34:12.300 --> 34:14.052
to repair their communications,

34:14.719 --> 34:17.555
well, that means that
they couldn't repair it themselves.

34:18.765 --> 34:22.393
This is an easy fix with up-to-date tech,

34:23.227 --> 34:24.937
but you don't have up-to-date anything.

34:26.064 --> 34:30.109
High-energy gamma
and gravitational waves...

34:32.111 --> 34:34.197
You're time travelers.

34:36.282 --> 34:41.037
I'm sure they really appreciate
that repair job, Kal.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.955
[Saru] I gave him no choice.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.166
If you take issue with that,
you may take issue with me.

34:45.249 --> 34:46.709
I'll take issue with him.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.090
[screaming]

35:02.517 --> 35:04.310
[gun cocks]

35:04.393 --> 35:06.395
[groaning]

35:10.691 --> 35:11.526
No.

35:15.571 --> 35:18.950
Or you won't live long enough
to watch her die.

35:31.379 --> 35:34.340
[Zareh] Give me those bags.
I wanna see what they brought with them.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.970
Scan the perimeter,
make sure they were stupid enough

35:39.053 --> 35:40.388
to come here on their own.

35:41.389 --> 35:43.391
Aya, contact the Tellarite Exchange.

35:44.642 --> 35:46.894
I think we'll do better
breaking these down for parts.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.814
Vintage tricorder, communicator.

35:50.690 --> 35:53.067
I'm gonna get these to the Orions myself.

35:53.484 --> 35:56.696
Zareh, I'm willing to discuss an exchange.

35:57.113 --> 35:59.824
Those items for the release
of Os'Ir and Tilly.

35:59.907 --> 36:01.909
[in pidgin]
We could shave the girl's head.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.953
Get something for the hair.

36:04.036 --> 36:06.998
They're time travelers.
They have a space ship.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.250
There are greater spoils to be had.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.961
We will get further
using the common tongue.

36:14.297 --> 36:17.925
[in English] Any captain with some miles
on him, even a V'draysh captain,

36:18.009 --> 36:19.385
would know pidgin.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.679
Are you new?

36:22.513 --> 36:24.515
I should offer my congratulations.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.894
The thing is, you got no authority here.

36:28.644 --> 36:32.523
Whereas, the burn was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

36:33.399 --> 36:35.443
Any success you achieve here
will be short-lived,

36:35.526 --> 36:37.945
because we will not permit
your tyranny to stand.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.947
But here it is, standing.

36:40.656 --> 36:43.451
And you, and what's left of your ship,

36:44.160 --> 36:46.078
aren't enough to do anything, really.

36:46.662 --> 36:49.290
We're all adrift together.

36:49.999 --> 36:53.169
All that matters now... is dilithium.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.504
Make it through the night.

36:56.130 --> 36:57.381
You'll understand that.

36:57.965 --> 36:58.799
So...

37:00.134 --> 37:01.135
shall we?

37:01.219 --> 37:04.639
I have made my position clear.
I will not take you to our ship.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.140
Principles, I get it.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.434
If dilithium is your priority,

37:08.517 --> 37:11.145
you and I will discuss
a reasonable trade here.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.814
Then we will go back
to retrieve the dilithium.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.524
Don't waste my time.

37:16.192 --> 37:18.945
-Or your 72 crew members--
-Eighty-eight.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.322
Our wounded are still our crew.

37:21.405 --> 37:24.367
Eighty-eight crew members
aboard your ship will, you know...

37:25.117 --> 37:26.035
they'll regret it.

37:27.245 --> 37:30.623
You're running out of time
to get the <i>Discovery</i> off the ground.

37:31.540 --> 37:32.500
[Zareth] <i>The ice...</i>

37:33.334 --> 37:34.710
<i>is parasitic.</i>

37:35.169 --> 37:36.796
<i>It'll crush the hull.</i>

37:37.713 --> 37:39.632
And eventually, everyone inside.

37:42.677 --> 37:45.721
[Stamets over radio]
<i>I'm at junction XG-11 beta. What now?</i>

37:45.805 --> 37:48.099
Tube will curve in three meters.

37:48.182 --> 37:51.477
Damaged relay is one meter beyond that.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.853
Commander?

37:53.437 --> 37:56.190
Linus said Georgiou left Deck 8
to help out here?

37:56.274 --> 37:57.191
And you believed that?

37:57.900 --> 37:59.652
Georgiou, helping?

37:59.735 --> 38:00.820
Seriously?

38:03.572 --> 38:05.700
-Damn it.
-Two hundred units.

38:05.783 --> 38:06.826
One hundred.

38:06.909 --> 38:09.787
-One seventy-five.
-One hundred and fifty units.

38:09.870 --> 38:11.080
See, that wasn't so hard.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.332
Now you...

38:15.209 --> 38:16.794
I genuinely like you...

38:17.753 --> 38:20.006
And I believe you'll come back
with my property.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.925
So, you're gonna go get me that dilithium.

38:25.011 --> 38:28.264
How about we wait here where it's cozy?

38:28.347 --> 38:30.308
But be quick, ensign.

38:31.475 --> 38:32.560
Come nightfall...

38:33.728 --> 38:34.687
the ice...

38:36.105 --> 38:39.066
well, it does what parasites do.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.278
It infests everything.

38:43.237 --> 38:45.406
I've seen it get down someone's throat.

38:47.033 --> 38:50.619
But you look like you can handle yourself.

38:50.703 --> 38:52.413
Maybe you can outrun it.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.623
Explosives help.

38:56.751 --> 39:01.505
You forge yourself a path
back to us once it's dark.

Okay, sweetheart?

<i>Do I look like a man who has no idea</i>
<i>what he's doing?</i>

39:16.729 --> 39:19.648
No, but you do look like a man

39:19.732 --> 39:21.609
and enjoys mixing metaphors.

39:21.692 --> 39:23.444
<i>Keep at it, cranky pants.</i>

39:24.028 --> 39:26.405
They said you might need
some help in here?

39:26.906 --> 39:30.826
No. We're at the ne plus ultra
of personal satisfaction.

39:30.910 --> 39:34.163
Say it just like that, "Ne plus ultra."

40:14.829 --> 40:17.039
A one-woman tactical response?

40:18.791 --> 40:22.128
V'draysh has officially reached its nadir.

40:22.545 --> 40:25.840
A fancy vocabulary
doesn't mean you're scary.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.299
It means you have a thesaurus.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.552
-Shoot her.
-No, shoot him.

40:29.635 --> 40:31.220
He's gonna get you killed.

40:32.513 --> 40:33.931
This is when you ask, "Why?"

40:34.682 --> 40:37.059
-Why?
-Glad you asked.

40:37.143 --> 40:39.937
You think you're the only ones
that saw a big ship fall from the sky?

40:40.020 --> 40:43.649
He knows your competitors
probably detected the ship,

40:43.732 --> 40:45.067
and they're already on their way.

40:45.734 --> 40:48.112
But he hasn't told you
you're too weak to take them out.

40:48.195 --> 40:50.114
And you don't have the firepower.

40:50.197 --> 40:51.574
Enough.

40:51.657 --> 40:53.826
I'm gonna enjoy this new world.

If this idiot can run a settlement,

45:19.550 --> 45:21.301
If not for me, you'd both be dead.

45:21.385 --> 45:24.138
And he'd be taking our dilithium
as we speak.

45:24.221 --> 45:27.266
Shoot them,
or you'll never get another delivery.

45:28.100 --> 45:30.978
I'll take out the silos
that maintain your atmosphere.

45:31.061 --> 45:33.897
Your kids will die gasping.

45:39.236 --> 45:40.279
Gasping!

45:40.362 --> 45:41.822
[grunts]

45:42.990 --> 45:44.324
Sorry, sweetheart.

45:45.325 --> 45:46.410
Give me your weapon.

45:46.493 --> 45:47.744
Now.

45:49.413 --> 45:50.497
I like my weapon.

45:50.581 --> 45:53.959
We defeated Control
and lost lives in the process.

45:54.334 --> 45:57.212
That sacrifice was not for this,
commander.

45:57.296 --> 46:00.841
I am the acting captain of the vessel
that brought you here. Stand down.

46:09.808 --> 46:11.059
[Georgiou chuckles]

46:15.856 --> 46:18.150
Kal always believed that
you were out there somewhere.

46:19.693 --> 46:21.945
And that we were a part of the Federation
no matter what.

46:22.613 --> 46:25.157
I get now why he never stopped
talking about you.

46:27.618 --> 46:30.412
I am truly sorry we could not save him.

46:31.788 --> 46:33.540
We will send more than enough dilithium

46:33.624 --> 46:35.792
for you to reach
the exchange Kal mentioned

46:36.543 --> 46:38.212
and repair your mining equipment.

46:40.297 --> 46:42.049
And we will leave you his vessel.

46:42.716 --> 46:45.427
But it is not our place
to decide his fate.

46:46.178 --> 46:47.012
It is yours.

46:47.596 --> 46:49.264
We have done enough damage here,

46:49.848 --> 46:51.808
and we humbly apologize.

47:10.619 --> 47:11.787
You're free to go.

47:11.870 --> 47:13.622
I won't last the night.

47:13.705 --> 47:15.999
You were willing to send her out there.

47:16.083 --> 47:17.125
Can I give him your pack?

47:25.425 --> 47:27.886
And if I see you reaching for it...

47:29.721 --> 47:31.014
I'll shoot you in the back.

47:31.974 --> 47:33.225
[grunts]

47:33.308 --> 47:34.685
And if you manage to live

47:34.768 --> 47:37.980
and decide you're feeling punitive
about this settlement,

47:39.022 --> 47:41.066
I'll come back and rip your throat out.

48:14.016 --> 48:15.517
We'd better get you back to your ship.

48:21.273 --> 48:22.441
Personal transporter.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.818
Welcome to the future.

48:33.744 --> 48:36.038
Commander, internal comms
are back up and running.

48:36.121 --> 48:37.205
We are good to go.

48:37.289 --> 48:40.375
All crew, this is Commander Saru.
Stations please.

48:40.459 --> 48:43.378
-Tactical is still offline.
-Sensors at 73 percent.

48:43.462 --> 48:46.340
External comms still reinitializing.
Three minutes until ready.

48:46.423 --> 48:48.133
Shields back in three minutes as well.

48:48.216 --> 48:49.718
Other operational systems online.

48:49.801 --> 48:52.638
None at full functionality just yet,
but we'll be all right.

48:55.307 --> 48:56.308
[Saru] Lieutenant Detmer?

48:58.935 --> 49:00.646
Lieutenant Detmer, status report?

49:02.022 --> 49:05.734
Impulse engines and maneuvering thrusters
are ready, sir, but we've never--

49:05.817 --> 49:10.238
I am well aware that starships were not
designed for lift-off in this fashion,

49:10.322 --> 49:12.240
but we have no choice.

49:12.324 --> 49:13.283
Full power, please.

49:14.368 --> 49:15.202
Aye, sir.

49:16.244 --> 49:17.496
Full power to thrusters.

49:34.179 --> 49:35.972
Hold us steady, lieutenant.

49:49.152 --> 49:50.570
[hull groaning]

49:51.279 --> 49:53.240
Divert all auxiliary power
to main thrusters.

49:53.740 --> 49:55.117
Diverting power now, sir.

49:55.450 --> 49:57.577
Sensors are showing hull strain
in the lower decks.

49:57.661 --> 49:59.955
System temperatures are exceeding
nominal levels, commander.

50:00.038 --> 50:02.457
Commander, something is coming toward us.
Something big.

50:02.541 --> 50:04.668
Enemy vessel. Right on top of us.

50:08.547 --> 50:11.383
Seems like Zareh's
more powerful friends have found us.

50:11.466 --> 50:14.052
-Red alert. Shields up.
-I need 18 more seconds.

50:14.136 --> 50:16.346
[Saru] Lieutenant Detmer,
get us out of here.

50:16.430 --> 50:17.681
[Detmer] I'm trying, sir.

50:23.729 --> 50:26.273
[Saru] Lieutenant, where are we
with those shields?

50:41.496 --> 50:43.582
Tractor beam.
They've grabbed ahold of our ship.

50:44.166 --> 50:47.085
Comms are back online, commander.
And we're being hailed.

50:47.711 --> 50:49.171
Shields are also back online.

50:49.254 --> 50:52.466
Weapons armed and ready.
What do you want us to do?

51:08.231 --> 51:09.649
Open a channel, Mr. Bryce.

51:10.317 --> 51:15.238
We will face whatever or whomever
has come for us... together.

51:15.322 --> 51:16.490
Channel open.

51:16.573 --> 51:18.074
On view screen, please.

51:32.964 --> 51:34.132
[chuckling]

51:34.216 --> 51:35.342
<i>Saru!</i>

51:37.594 --> 51:38.512
Michael?

51:41.473 --> 51:43.350
<i>Yeah. It's me.</i>

51:44.643 --> 51:45.811
<i>I found you.</i>

51:46.895 --> 51:48.980
<i>I've been looking for so long.</i>

51:54.528 --> 51:56.029
You-- You're--

51:56.905 --> 51:58.657
-You look--
<i>-Saru...</i>

52:00.408 --> 52:02.494
<i>I landed here a year ago.</i>

52:04.079 --> 52:06.039
<i>I've been waiting for all of you,</i>

52:06.665 --> 52:07.833
<i>all this time.</i>
