00:02.336 --> 00:06.249
BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

00:07.383 --> 00:10.170
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

00:10.386 --> 00:13.128
But secretly with the help of my friends
at 8. TA. R. Labs,

00:13.347 --> 00:16.180
I ﬁght crime
and ﬁnd other meta-humans like me.

00:16.976 --> 00:18.637
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

00:18.853 --> 00:22.311
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.435
And I am the only one fast enough
to stop them.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.687
I am The Flash.

00:28.988 --> 00:30.478
HARRISON: Previously on The Flash...

00:30.698 --> 00:35.909
There is indeed a hole in our universe
which leads to his Earth.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.204
.mm-m:mmmmmmm

00:40.416 --> 00:44.250
Do you think we've reached
the goodnight-kiss stage?

00:44.879 --> 00:48.087
Zoom is obsessed with speed.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.964
He has been sending
meta-humans from your world

00:51.177 --> 00:52.667
through the breaches to ﬁght me.

00:52.929 --> 00:54.715
Her name is Dr. Light.

00:54.931 --> 00:55.966
Hello, gorgeous.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.175
What do you want from me?

00:58.184 --> 00:59.219
Your life.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.508
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:00.728 --> 01:01.968
I saw myself.

01:02.188 --> 01:03.769
It sounds like you have an evil meta-twin.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.268
Where are you?

01:06.567 --> 01:07.602
(GROANS)

01:07.902 --> 01:08.937
I'm right here.

01:12.281 --> 01:15.773
I'm here to kill you, Flash.
So get ready to fry.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.028
(GROANS)

01:17.495 --> 01:18.530
Bring it on.

01:18.871 --> 01:19.986
Hmm. (CHUCKLES)

01:37.932 --> 01:38.967
Told you.

01:41.352 --> 01:43.934
Zoom always wins.

01:55.825 --> 01:57.361
Zoom sent me here to kill you.

01:58.411 --> 01:59.526
371]“me

02:00.663 --> 02:02.619
But you were ﬁne with killing Linda Park.

02:02.832 --> 02:05.744
It was the best bad idea
I could come up with.

02:06.168 --> 02:10.002
Leave her body for Zoom to ﬁnd.
He'd think I was dead and I'd be free.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.255
How was he supposed to know
where to ﬁnd her body?

02:14.010 --> 02:15.295
Just let me go.

02:16.429 --> 02:17.635
Let me disappear.

02:18.973 --> 02:21.180
You would spend the rest of your life
looking over your shoulder,

02:21.392 --> 02:22.882
never knowing when Zoom is coming.

02:23.102 --> 02:24.137
Okay.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.428
And what's your great idea?

02:27.523 --> 02:29.514
How were you supposed to contact him
after you killed me?

02:29.859 --> 02:31.690
I was supposed to get something.

02:32.361 --> 02:34.192
Something I could only get
if you were dead.

02:34.405 --> 02:36.066
And then throw it through
the breach as proof.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.525
rmnmmi

02:37.700 --> 02:40.658
Then he'd come for me.
Conﬁrm the kill and bring me home.

02:40.870 --> 02:42.610
-Why do you want to know?
-Because I want to ﬁnd him.

02:42.830 --> 02:43.865
You really don't.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.280
He's gonna keep coming for me.

02:46.042 --> 02:49.626
He's gonna keep kidnapping people like
you, forcing them to do what he wants.

02:50.087 --> 02:53.045
I have to stop him before more people die.

02:53.424 --> 02:54.664
You can't stop Zoom.

02:54.884 --> 02:59.048
Yes I can. I will. But I need your help.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.841
Zoom wants Dr. Light to send him
your new emblem?

03:06.062 --> 03:07.643
Yes. We need it for bait.

03:07.855 --> 03:11.973
If we can get Dr. Light to take
my emblem, throw it through the breach.

03:12.193 --> 03:15.026
then Zoom will come to collect my body
and we can trap him.

03:15.237 --> 03:17.023
You know it took a lot of work
to make that emblem, right?

03:17.239 --> 03:19.491
This is the woman
who was willing to kill Linda

03:19.700 --> 03:22.942
in order to escape Zoom, but now
she's willing to help us catch him?

03:23.162 --> 03:24.368
She knows it's the only way.

03:24.580 --> 03:29.700
Before I left Earth-2, I worked on a
serum to dampen Zoom's speed.

03:29.919 --> 03:33.127
All we would need is for Ramon
to develop a weapon to deliver it.

03:33.339 --> 03:35.625
Oh, great. that could be
this year's cold gun.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.583
Maybe another criminal can get it
and then we'd have Sergeant Slow.

03:38.803 --> 03:41.715
I would never let that happen.
Sergeant Slow is a terrible name.

03:41.931 --> 03:46.095
Are we forgetting how much more powerful
than Bany Zoom seems to be?

03:46.310 --> 03:47.971
I mean, if Bany can catch bullets,

03:48.187 --> 03:50.394
what's to say Zoom can't catch
whatever you shoot at him?

03:50.606 --> 03:53.814
Surprise, the element of surprise.

03:54.026 --> 03:57.735
All we would do is rig a projectile to
ﬁre as Zoom crosses into the breach.

03:57.947 --> 03:59.778
He can't stop what he can't see coming.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.109
-That's great
-Thanks.

04:01.283 --> 04:02.944
(SIGHS) Joe, voice of reason here?

04:03.911 --> 04:07.950
We need a plan, that's as good as any.
As long as he can deliver.

04:08.249 --> 04:09.329
Don't underestimate me. Detective.

04:09.542 --> 04:10.622
-(PHONE VIBRATING)
-Oh.

04:10.835 --> 04:14.794
Patty needs us back at the station.
I'll meet you there, all right?

04:21.554 --> 04:24.762
Are you just forgetting everything Jay
told us and supporting Wells now?

04:24.974 --> 04:26.464
Oh, no, I don't trust Wells at all.

04:26.684 --> 04:27.924
I just want to see what he's up to.

04:28.144 --> 04:30.009
I ﬁgure, we give him some rope,
he'll hang himself.

04:30.229 --> 04:32.220
Yeah, I'm totally with you.
I think he's hiding something.

04:32.648 --> 04:36.516
Look, my hunch after interrogating
suspects all these years,

04:37.319 --> 04:38.604
something's not right with this dude.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.605
Bany told me about this thing you can do?

04:42.783 --> 04:43.818
-Oh. God.
-VIbing.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.453
Can you do it with Wells?

04:47.580 --> 04:48.740
loan try.

04:57.298 --> 05:00.005
HARRISON: Incapable?
Well, let me tell you something.

05:00.342 --> 05:03.834
If you're
incapable of aligning the quantum helix,

05:04.054 --> 05:07.512
and by the way, the sole purpose
of your employment here at S.T.A.R. Labs,

05:07.766 --> 05:08.846
could you save me some time and effort,

05:09.059 --> 05:13.018
could you go out there and ﬁnd someone
who can actually do your job for you?

05:15.149 --> 05:16.229
There it is.

05:17.860 --> 05:18.895
I'll-11m

05:21.030 --> 05:23.521
When I was little, and you used
to bring me to S.T.A.R. Labs with you,

05:23.741 --> 05:24.821
it used to freak me out,

05:25.034 --> 05:26.899
how differently you talked here
than when you're at home.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.993
You and your mother, both.
Shouldn't you be at school?

05:30.247 --> 05:31.657
I graduated high school
when Iwas 15, Dad.

05:31.874 --> 05:33.159
-(CHUCKLES)
-Right.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.535
I can miss a day of college.

05:34.877 --> 05:37.664
Ah. that's my Jess, always so quick.

05:39.215 --> 05:40.375
[CI-T]

05:41.091 --> 05:42.126
So.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.423
IS it true? (SIGHS)

05:48.891 --> 05:51.177
that your particle accelerator
created the meta-humans?

05:53.229 --> 05:56.062
-It is... (SIGHS) Jesse—
-Look, why didn't you just tell me?

05:58.734 --> 06:00.395
Jay Garrick, it turns out,

06:00.611 --> 06:06.151
is much faster at assigning blame
than he is at actual heroics.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.358
-Dad, The Flash is a hero.
-Uh-huh.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.738
Hey, I've never understood
why you disliked him so much.

06:10.955 --> 06:13.947
But now I know it's because he knew
what you'd done.

06:14.166 --> 06:17.374
What I've done at S.T.A.R. Labs
is change the world, Jesse.

06:17.586 --> 06:20.544
Unlocking the mysteries of the universe.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.168
And when you don't have
the key to the lock,

06:24.093 --> 06:25.958
sometimes you have to kick in the door.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.423
You should get to school.

06:30.182 --> 06:33.674
Don't wony. I got my education today.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.063
You're my joy, Jesse Quick.

06:50.494 --> 06:52.325
-JOE: All right. Talk to you later.
-WOMAN: See you, Joe.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.036
Great, you're here.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.366
Good morning to you too, Patty.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.619
Yes. I was up all night
working on the Dr. Light case.

06:57.835 --> 07:00.451
I've been trying to anticipate
all the powers she might throw our way,

07:00.671 --> 07:03.037
you know, on the premise
that she can manipulate light energy.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.542
-I appreciate it, but—
-Did you know

07:04.758 --> 07:07.044
that light energy
can be turned into hard light?

07:07.219 --> 07:08.800
I mean, that doesn't even
sound like a thing, but it is.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.006
-Seriously, Patty—
-No,

07:10.180 --> 07:11.841
and on the other end of the spectrum
is invisibility.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.888
Look, it's just hypothetical.
but I think that—

07:14.101 --> 07:16.592
The Dr. Light case is closed.

07:18.022 --> 07:19.228
Oh. Uh...

07:20.608 --> 07:22.018
Okay, can you tell me why?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.190
1r.)

07:26.238 --> 07:27.273
15?]

07:29.033 --> 07:30.193
-Okay.
-Hey.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.899
-Hi.
-Are you good?

07:32.119 --> 07:35.282
Yeah. I'm ﬁne, your dad just shut me down
in a big way.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.033
-What do you mean?
-(STUTTERS)

07:37.374 --> 07:42.744
I don't know, it just... You don't think
it's because you and I kissed?

07:43.922 --> 07:45.708
No, I don't think he knows.
I didn't say anything.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.634
But I can talk to him if you want.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.128
NO, no, no. (STUTTERS) I'll talk to him.

07:49.345 --> 07:52.087
You know, he's my partner,
we should have trust and communication.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.967
Are you sure?
I don't mind talking about that kiss.

07:54.183 --> 07:55.218
It was a good kiss.

07:55.392 --> 08:00.807
Yeah, yeah. Although. the memory.
it's a little foggy.

08:01.732 --> 08:02.938
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.812
I might need, like, a reminder soon.

08:06.779 --> 08:07.814
Okay.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.579
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.742
Have you had any word from The Flash
about the meta-human that killed Larkin?

08:25.130 --> 08:27.507
No. Not yet.
But I know he's working on it.

08:28.884 --> 08:29.999
You know. maybe I could talk to him.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.880
Linda, I don't think that's a good idea.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.675
Look, Larkin is dead,
which makes it really hard for me

08:35.891 --> 08:38.473
to concentrate
on ﬁeld goals and doping scandals.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.723
I don't want to sit around being told not
to wony my pretty little head about it.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.687
I get that. Believe me, I do.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.107
Then tell him I want to help. Please.

08:47.486 --> 08:50.023
I can't let this woman who looks like me
hurt anyone else.

08:50.906 --> 08:55.650
I'll ask again. But trust me.
Flash has everything under control.

09:04.795 --> 09:05.830
Crap.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.803
(BREATHES SHAKILY)

09:28.026 --> 09:29.186
Dr. Light's gone invisiblel

09:29.403 --> 09:30.438
rmmrmmi

09:31.488 --> 09:32.523
5mm

09:34.825 --> 09:38.158
The door is not responding. None of
the security protocols are responding.

09:38.954 --> 09:39.989
She's hacked the system.

09:40.164 --> 09:41.654
Bany, Dr. Light is escaping!

09:47.546 --> 09:48.661
mmm

09:57.890 --> 10:00.256
Dr. Light managed to hack
into the lights of her cell.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.553
So, she turned off the dampeners
and used her power.

10:06.774 --> 10:07.854
I told you how dangerous she was.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.351
You should've listened to me
and sedated her.

10:09.568 --> 10:10.603
I thought I had convinced her

10:10.819 --> 10:12.980
that helping us was the only way
she'd free herself from Zoom.

10:13.197 --> 10:14.232
-Well, you thought wrong.
-Yeah.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.733
Okay, look. Dr. Light is gone.

10:15.908 --> 10:19.071
So, instead of assigning blame, let's try
to ﬁgure out what we're going to do next.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.859
Do you think she's going to try
and take Linda again?

10:21.079 --> 10:23.912
I had Iris bring Linda to the house,
just in case. to keep an eye on her.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.739
How are we doing with the speed-dampener?

10:25.959 --> 10:27.244
I think we isolated the composite.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.668
And we're modifying the dart
the Arrow used to take down Wells.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.713
He's not Wells, I'm Wells.

10:32.925 --> 10:33.960
Whatever, Hany.

10:34.176 --> 10:35.586
But we don't even really know
if this thing works.

10:35.761 --> 10:37.422
HARRISON: Until we try it, no.
This will be a ﬁeld test.

10:37.596 --> 10:40.133
So, can we end this scintillating
staff meeting and get back to work?

10:40.349 --> 10:41.589
Or how 'bout I say
what everybody's thinking.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.549
Maybe it's a good thing
that Dr. Light is gone.

10:43.769 --> 10:46.511
Maybe it's the universe stopping us
from doing something really stupid.

10:46.730 --> 10:51.064
No. No. Keep going. I'm gonna ﬁgure out
another way to get Zoom.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.561
Hey, slow your roll. I wanna talk to you.

10:55.781 --> 10:58.523
Joe, look, I know what I'm doing.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.357
Okay, I don't.
So why don't you clue me in?

11:00.577 --> 11:03.159
I'm trying to stop Zoom.
I thought you were on board with that.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.612
I'm keeping my options open.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.368
I don't understand
why you think we have a choice.

11:09.211 --> 11:10.667
The meta-humans
that he's sending from Earth-2,

11:10.879 --> 11:12.540
they don't care
how many innocent people get in the way.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.667
Look at what happened
to Iris and Linda's boss.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.965
He was just collateral damage
in Zoom's war.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.088
The next time, that could be you, or Iris.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.011
I'm just wondering
if going after him now is premature.

11:22.224 --> 11:23.930
I mean, we barely know anything
about his abilities.

11:24.101 --> 11:25.136
wmmm

11:25.310 --> 11:26.561
You're putting a whole lot of faith
in the man

11:26.770 --> 11:28.351
wearing the face of your mother's killer.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.684
I think we should ﬁnd Jay,
get him to help us on this.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.354
Nah, Jay made it pretty clear
that he doesn't wanna help get me killed.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.611

your high school football tryouts.
