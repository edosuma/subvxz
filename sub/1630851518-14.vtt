WEBVTT

00:23.806 --> 00:26.287
It's the end of an era,
y'all.

00:29.594 --> 00:33.163
I'm the king
of unemployment!

00:37.646 --> 00:38.473
23!

00:38.516 --> 00:40.083
Hey!

00:42.129 --> 00:43.608
Hey, let's get one
with the cap.

00:43.652 --> 00:44.435
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Come on.

00:44.479 --> 00:45.784
Alright.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.482
- Be like Jordan, baby.

00:47.525 --> 00:50.180
Hey.
Come on, come on.

00:50.224 --> 00:50.920
Can you snap me
with them real quick?

00:50.963 --> 00:52.182
Oh, yeah. Oh.

01:51.154 --> 01:53.200
It was my first house.

01:53.243 --> 01:54.853
It was my only house.

01:54.897 --> 01:57.247
It was the house that took me in
after I lost it all.

01:57.291 --> 02:00.032
Same.

02:00.076 --> 02:03.514
It was a good house.

02:03.558 --> 02:05.603
Hear, hear.

02:05.647 --> 02:06.778
Okay,
who wants a drink?

02:06.822 --> 02:07.910
- Oh.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:07.953 --> 02:09.259
Yes.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.000
I better hit the road
before my wife comes

02:11.043 --> 02:12.567
and drags me home, so --

02:12.610 --> 02:13.916
- Aw!
- Yeah.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.918
Boo!
I know. I know. I know.

02:15.961 --> 02:17.137
Come on, man.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.268
23!

02:18.312 --> 02:20.140
23!

02:20.183 --> 02:23.055
Herrera,
I know that was tough,

02:23.099 --> 02:24.927
but you handled it
with grace.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.408
I can't make you any promises,
but I'm doing everything

02:27.451 --> 02:30.019
that I can to make sure
you land back at 19.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.194
Thanks, Chief.

02:31.238 --> 02:32.978
Yeah.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.893
See you.

02:51.997 --> 02:54.913
It was a good clinic day,
I thought.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.351
Twice the volume
as the first day.

02:57.394 --> 02:58.961
Yeah, you know, and, uh,
Chief Ross wasn't here

02:59.004 --> 03:00.484
to see my big comeback, either,
so...

03:00.528 --> 03:02.269
Well, probably too busy shutting
down stations

03:02.312 --> 03:04.923
and denying promotions.

03:04.967 --> 03:07.622
Sorry.
I'm still working on it.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.667
Almost there, I swear.

03:09.711 --> 03:14.237
And have you thought about it
yet?

03:14.281 --> 03:17.414
Oh, about the fact that you are
actually entertaining

03:17.458 --> 03:21.026
the idea of my ex-boyfriend
being our sperm donor?

03:21.070 --> 03:21.853
Yeah, it's all
I can think about.

03:21.897 --> 03:23.986
Okay, okay.

03:24.029 --> 03:27.468
I prefer to think of him
as my friend,

03:27.511 --> 03:31.472
not as your ex-boyfriend,
and I know,

03:31.515 --> 03:35.215
he's the last person I thought
I'd want as our sperm donor,

03:35.258 --> 03:38.261
but we've been looking
at options for months,

03:38.305 --> 03:41.351
and nothing has felt right,
and then he offered,

03:41.395 --> 03:43.223
and it got into my brain

03:43.266 --> 03:45.486
and I can't seem to
shake it out of it.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.270
It's just that,
a couple months ago,

03:47.314 --> 03:49.359
you didn't want me to be
in the same room with him,

03:49.403 --> 03:53.015
and now you want him to
potentially be in our family.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.843
I know. I know.
It sounds crazy.

03:54.886 --> 03:57.454
But the thought of
the two of you together

03:57.498 --> 04:00.631
used to make me want
to smash dishes.

04:00.675 --> 04:03.460
But now, honestly?

04:03.504 --> 04:05.680
I can't imagine it.
It makes me laugh.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.291
He's a doofus.
Come on.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.641
I've been spending
so much time with him

04:10.685 --> 04:14.079
because of the clinic,
and he's a little awkward,

04:14.123 --> 04:18.606
but he's also kind
and humble and smart.

04:18.649 --> 04:21.435
And handsome. Whatever.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.437
Do I need to be concerned
about you two?

04:23.480 --> 04:27.963
I'm only saying maybe we think
about the future

04:28.006 --> 04:30.052
and not about the past.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.230
Well, it's just that I
thought I was supposed to

04:34.274 --> 04:35.710
have an interview
with that Tabitha woman,

04:35.753 --> 04:36.928
and then I heard nothing.

04:36.972 --> 04:38.190
You take me off the list?

04:38.234 --> 04:40.192
No, no.
You're still on the list.

04:40.236 --> 04:42.325
Oh, God, are the Millers pulling
some crap again?

04:42.369 --> 04:45.285
I swear, I don't know how Dean
came out of those two ass--

04:45.328 --> 04:47.417
No, they are very
fine people, okay?

04:47.461 --> 04:49.637
They just, uh...

04:51.508 --> 04:53.249
We might be settling
out of court.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.946
They want us to have
full custody.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.340
What? Are you serious?

04:57.384 --> 04:58.733
Shh!
We have to celebrate.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.082
We got her? We got Pru?

05:00.125 --> 05:01.649
Y-Y-Yes.
K-Keep your voice down.

05:01.692 --> 05:03.303
- We got -- mm-hm-mm.
- Keep your voice down.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.392
But we have her, yes.
For now.
Mm-hmm.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.959
It's looking promising,
but, uh --
Okay.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.398
They've, uh --
They've got one request.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.008
They've got
one final request,

05:13.051 --> 05:15.358
and I don't know
if I can give it to them.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.925
Okay, well, whatever it is,
you got to do it

05:16.968 --> 05:19.231
'cause it's Pru, so --I am aware.

05:19.275 --> 05:21.364
Okay, so stop being Mr.
Cautious-Keep-Your-Voice-Down

05:21.408 --> 05:22.974
and start celebrating.

05:23.018 --> 05:25.542
Cause we got Pru.
We got Pru!

05:25.586 --> 05:26.630
What?
Shh!

05:26.674 --> 05:27.631
Uh, n-nothing. Nothing.

05:27.675 --> 05:28.937
She's just being silly.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.591
Shh!
Would you shut up?

05:30.634 --> 05:34.508
Ugh.
Come on, Trav.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.385
Mom, Dad, we're here.

05:42.429 --> 05:43.734
Whose birthday is it?

05:43.778 --> 05:45.606
Uh, Dad's.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.259
You didn't tell me it was
your dad's birthday.

05:47.303 --> 05:49.392
Yeah, I didn't want to give you
a reason to skip it.

05:49.436 --> 05:50.698
I didn't bring a gift.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.526
Trust me, he won't care.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.179
I care.

05:54.223 --> 05:56.530
I mean, it's bad enough
showing up empty-handed.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.096
I told you to.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.620
But showing up empty-handed
to a birthday?

05:59.663 --> 06:02.231
I mean, not even a card or
flowers or a bottle of wine.

06:02.274 --> 06:04.581
Believe me,
my mom will have wine.

06:04.625 --> 06:07.105
I can feel my mother's
red-hot laser beam of shame

06:07.149 --> 06:09.020
roasting me
from way across town.
Hi, Mom.

06:09.064 --> 06:11.849
Trav, I'm telling you,
it's fine.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.416
Hello.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.417
Hi.
Hey.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.114
Hi. Mwah.

06:16.158 --> 06:18.900
Mm, nice to see my boy
on time for once.

06:18.943 --> 06:21.555
Kitty Dixon. So lovely to
finally meet you, Trevor.

06:21.598 --> 06:22.817
It's Travis, Mom.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.427
Oh! Right.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.037
Uh, Trevor's the surgeon
who did my neck lift.

06:26.081 --> 06:28.736
He's a genius.
I look 30.
Yes.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.477
Uh, Birthday Boy,
our guests are here.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.130
Don't be rude.

06:32.174 --> 06:34.176
Oh, tell him he looks nice,
okay?

06:34.219 --> 06:35.438
I'm trying to upgrade his look
a bit.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.657
Oh.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.485
- Welcome. Hey.
- Hey.

06:38.528 --> 06:39.921
- Nice sweater.
- Really great sweater.

06:39.964 --> 06:42.097
- It looks very warm.
- Mm-hmm.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.490
- I look like a cupcake.
- Oh, God.

06:43.533 --> 06:44.969
Your mother's doing.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.318
Mm.

06:46.362 --> 06:48.103
Nice to see you,
Montgomery.

06:48.146 --> 06:50.453
Happy birthday, Chief --
sir -- Dixon.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.890
- No, just call him Dick.
- I don't think I can.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.457
Kitty, do these boys
need drinks?

06:54.501 --> 06:55.806
Yes.
Oh, yeah,
just wine for me,

06:55.850 --> 06:57.460
- please, yeah.
- Ah, come on, Emmett.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.723
Be a man.
Have a Scotch.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.464
Travis, what's your poison?

07:01.508 --> 07:03.684
- I make a mean Manhattan.
- Oh, I got it, honey.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.599
Trust me, mine are better.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.383
He shakes his Manhattans
like a heathen.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.952
He also likes his steaks
well done.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.344
Yes, sir, you can bring it in
anytime.

07:12.388 --> 07:14.129
We'd be glad to check out
your fire extinguisher

07:14.172 --> 07:15.957
to make sure
it works alright.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.350
Yes, sir.
Have a good night.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.265
Chief Ross,
how can I help you?

07:20.309 --> 07:21.528
Lieutenant Sullivan,
this is Captain Henderson,

07:22.224 --> 07:25.314
a representative from
the Professional Standards Unit.

07:25.357 --> 07:26.794
I've heard good things.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.230
Wish I could say
the same.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.712
Uh, Captain, why don't you go
ahead in and say hello

07:31.755 --> 07:34.454
to Captain Beckett and I'll join
you in a moment, okay?

07:35.933 --> 07:37.457
Come in.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.459
You're doing this now?
In the middle of a shift?

07:39.502 --> 07:41.504
Hey, it took me a couple of days
to get the department behind me,

07:41.548 --> 07:44.507
but I didn't want to wait any
longer if he's a danger to 19.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.248
Sully, you better be right
about this.

07:46.291 --> 07:47.249
'Cause if you're wrong --

07:47.292 --> 07:48.990
I'm not wrong.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.078
Alright.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.258
Captain Beckett.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.652
Chief Ross.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.132
So, the department
just has a few questions

08:01.176 --> 08:03.700
about your recent
- performance.
- Uh-huh.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.573
The pipeline explosion
which resulted in the death

08:06.616 --> 08:07.922
of two firefighters --

08:07.965 --> 08:10.054
Is still under investigation
by the city.

08:10.098 --> 08:12.013
But you made the call
to leave your post

08:12.056 --> 08:13.493
and go on foot,
is that correct?

08:13.536 --> 08:15.190
I left Incident Command
to Chief McCallister,

08:15.233 --> 08:16.713
as more hands
were needed,

08:16.757 --> 08:19.324
just like any good firefighter
would do.

08:19.368 --> 08:22.327
And the incident with the engine
at the Phoenix fair?

08:22.371 --> 08:23.807
Do you have eyes in the back

08:23.851 --> 08:24.982
of your head at all times,
Chief?

08:25.026 --> 08:26.418
What about
the candy factory fire?

08:26.462 --> 08:28.159
You had
the schematics wrong.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.205
I was working off
of a hand-drawn map.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.556
Respectfully, Chief,
you say you're direct,

08:33.600 --> 08:35.950
so, please, be direct.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.521
I recently had an anonymous tip
with concern

08:41.564 --> 08:44.219
that you have been drinking
on the job.

08:44.262 --> 08:45.699
- Hmm.
- After asking you
a few questions,

08:45.742 --> 08:48.310
I don't think that's
an unfounded concern.

08:48.353 --> 08:50.094
Thank you.

08:50.138 --> 08:53.141
You will need to submit
a urine sample.

08:53.184 --> 08:55.360
Captain Henderson will escort
you to the restroom

08:55.404 --> 08:57.667
to witness the sample, and then
he will escort you home,

08:57.711 --> 09:00.583
where you will remain
until the results come in.

09:00.627 --> 09:03.586
Permitting you're clean, you can
come back to your shift.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.066
Is this clear, Captain?

09:05.109 --> 09:06.981
Is that how we're gonna
play this?

09:07.024 --> 09:10.245
The department takes accusations
of this nature very seriously.

09:10.288 --> 09:12.508
Are we clear, Captain?

09:12.552 --> 09:14.249
I'm not leaving
my team mid-shift

09:14.292 --> 09:16.033
and having them
wonder why.

09:16.077 --> 09:19.863
I'll stay here. You can even
send in a babysitter.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.865
Fine.

09:21.909 --> 09:23.606
But once you give us the sample,
you're not to leave this room

09:23.650 --> 09:26.261
until the results come in.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.393
Please escort Captain Beckett
to the restroom.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.937
Alright,
first round's on me.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.636
10 beers, please.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.072
Hey, what's up,
man?!

09:55.116 --> 09:57.118
You okay?

09:57.161 --> 09:59.207
Yeah.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.471
You know it's okay not to be,
right?

10:02.514 --> 10:04.168
You were at 23
a long time.

10:04.212 --> 10:08.608
I was, uh -- I was sent to 23
after Michael...

10:08.651 --> 10:10.784
It felt like exile.

10:10.827 --> 10:14.265
And then it kinda became
a-a haven.

10:14.309 --> 10:17.225
You know, there were no
expectations to promote again...

10:17.268 --> 10:18.661
Mm.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.794
...make big splashes,
or be anything

10:20.837 --> 10:24.449
other than a dutiful
firefighter.

10:24.493 --> 10:28.758
You know, and yeah, 23 had its
problems, but, you know,

10:28.802 --> 10:32.283
being there let me be okay,
so...

10:32.327 --> 10:35.069
I'm mad as hell that some
new brass from San Diego

10:35.112 --> 10:38.855
can just show up and decide
it's closed like that.

10:38.899 --> 10:41.075
Actually, can I get a shot
of tequila, too?

10:41.118 --> 10:42.859
And, yeah,
we're all here drinking,

10:42.903 --> 10:43.991
'cause our station's
closed down.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.559
You're staring.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.953
Shut up.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.607
Whoo! Alright.

10:54.218 --> 10:56.003
Warren, how's it going with
the Millers

10:56.046 --> 10:58.048
and Pru and all that?

10:58.092 --> 11:00.137
Oh, well, you know --
you know, it's a whole --

11:00.181 --> 11:01.704
I don't think Travis
has missed a shift

11:01.748 --> 11:02.618
since he started at 19.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.228
Mm, that's not true.

11:04.272 --> 11:06.143
You know, he missed
them three weeks when the...

11:06.187 --> 11:08.711
Well, give a guy a pass
for penetrating trauma.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.887
Okay, but, you know,
it just speaks to his work ethic

11:10.931 --> 11:13.150
is all I'm saying.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.891
I wonder what Dixon's house
looks like.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.719
Uh, well, he probably
has a sex dungeon

11:16.763 --> 11:17.633
even his wife doesn't know
about.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.722
19.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.246
No, sit, sit.
Keep eating.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.945
I just wanted to
update you all.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.730
There's, um --
There's been a situation,

11:27.774 --> 11:30.820
and Captain Beckett will not be
on duty until further notice.

11:30.864 --> 11:33.344
Lieutenant Sullivan,

11:33.388 --> 11:36.521
you are acting captain
for the rest of the shift.

11:36.565 --> 11:39.524
Enjoy your dinner.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.357
Did you know that Chief Ross --

11:46.401 --> 11:49.273
<i>Engine 19, Ladder 19,</i>
<i>and Aid Car 19</i>

11:49.317 --> 11:51.711
<i>requested to 8214 Crabb Way.</i>

12:02.460 --> 12:04.071
What the hell's
going on?

12:04.114 --> 12:05.594
No idea.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.555
Let's go, 19!

12:22.872 --> 12:25.179
Uh, you're welcome.

12:25.222 --> 12:27.181
But you should tell them.

12:27.224 --> 12:29.096
We need a win around here,
and Pru is ours.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.227
And she might be living
in your house,

12:30.271 --> 12:31.620
but she's
our firehouse baby,

12:31.663 --> 12:32.795
and we deserve a little bit
of happy --

12:32.839 --> 12:34.362
They want me to quit
firefighting.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.625
Alright?
Th-That's their request.

12:40.629 --> 12:43.023
They don't want Pru
- to lose another dad.
- Yeah.

12:43.066 --> 12:45.765
That's why
we're not celebrating.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.157
But you can't quit.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.029
Mm-hmm.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.421
But you have
to raise Pru.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.641
Yeah.

12:52.684 --> 12:54.208
Here we go.

13:05.610 --> 13:09.049
Alright, reports are a car fire
four floors down.

13:09.092 --> 13:11.573
Gibson, Bishop,
you're on fire attack on S4.

13:11.616 --> 13:14.402
Warren, Hughes, search
and rescue, S1 down to S4.

13:14.445 --> 13:16.143
Let's go.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.449
Dispatch, requesting
additional aid cars.

13:18.493 --> 13:21.452
Cutler, Klyne, assist Warren
and Hughes on evac.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.935
Nice and clean tonight, 19.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.850
Nice and clean.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.721
Three people down!

13:31.549 --> 13:33.464
Hello!
Seattle Fire!

13:33.508 --> 13:36.859
Seattle Fire!
Seattle Fire!

13:36.903 --> 13:38.208
Is anybody in here?!

13:38.252 --> 13:42.125
Seattle Fire!
Holler if you can hear me!

13:42.169 --> 13:44.345
Hello?! Seattle Fire!

13:45.825 --> 13:47.652
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am,
no, no, no.

13:47.696 --> 13:49.524
- You cannot be in here.
- My kids are down there.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.874
No! What are you doing?
I have to get back down there!

13:51.918 --> 13:52.962
No, no, ma'am --Let go of me!

13:53.006 --> 13:55.095
We cannot let you go
back down there.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.574
- The smoke is too thick.
- I don't give a damn
about the smoke.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.098
My kids are still
in the car.

13:58.141 --> 13:59.490
Okay, okay, ma'am.
What are their names?

13:59.534 --> 14:00.883
Abby and Jonny.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.363
I just had to run
into the store.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.539
This is Incident Command,
maintenance says

14:04.582 --> 14:07.411
the fire's coming from a hybrid
car that may be plugged in.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.457
Gonna cut power.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.546
Okay, ma'am, it's about to get
really dark in here.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.069
If you can't help me,
then get out of my way!

14:13.113 --> 14:14.897
Ma'am, ma'am,
we can find your children.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.333
You're just wasting time!

14:16.377 --> 14:17.639
We cannot do that
with you in here.

14:17.682 --> 14:19.119
Okay?
Cutler, Cutler,

14:19.162 --> 14:20.468
can you take her outside
so we can continue evac?

14:20.511 --> 14:21.730
I am not leaving!

14:21.773 --> 14:23.645
Ma'am, listen --
listen to me!

14:23.688 --> 14:25.821
You need to let us do our job
so we can bring

14:25.865 --> 14:27.388
your kids back to you
safely.

14:27.431 --> 14:30.695
The longer you fight us, the
longer it takes us to find them.

14:33.263 --> 14:34.525
Alright, great.
Now, go with them.

14:34.569 --> 14:35.657
They'll take care of you.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.571
Okay.
Thanks, fellas.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.660
Abby! Jonny!
Hello?!

14:42.925 --> 14:44.927
A toy gun?
Yep. That's my boy.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.103
He used to love playing
cops and robbers.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.018
No, he loved
playing dress-up.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.802
Oh, I had this pair
of high-heeled leather boots

14:50.846 --> 14:52.935
that he was obsessed with.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.371
I always found him
in my closet.

14:54.415 --> 14:55.807
Okay, no more photos.
Thanks, Mom. We know --

14:55.851 --> 14:57.331
Oh, no, no, no.

14:57.374 --> 14:58.898
Please,
- please keep them coming.
- Ah.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.074
Montgomery, did you play
any sports in school?

15:01.117 --> 15:02.902
I wrestled for four years
in high school,

15:02.945 --> 15:04.947
varsity for three.
Impressive.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.515
Yeah, I mean, I only joined
the team freshman year

15:07.558 --> 15:08.995
because I had a crush
on this guy,

15:09.038 --> 15:10.474
but then I ended up
really liking it.

15:10.518 --> 15:12.476
Oh, so you were gay
even back then? Trendsetter.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.957
- Mom.
- What'd I say?

15:15.001 --> 15:20.397
Montgomery, how's that new, uh,
lady fire chief working out?

15:20.441 --> 15:22.269
I heard she closed
Station 23.

15:22.312 --> 15:24.053
Chief Ross is impressive.

15:24.097 --> 15:27.013
You know, she's smart.
Direct. Decisive.

15:27.056 --> 15:30.494
And the right fit
for the moment we're in --

15:30.538 --> 15:32.409
female
and a double minority --

15:32.453 --> 15:34.107
- Black and Asian.
- Ah.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.065
- Isn't she gay, too?
- Who isn't nowadays?

15:38.198 --> 15:40.896
Uh, I'm not quite sure
about her personal life.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.811
The department needs
more conservatism.

15:42.854 --> 15:44.160
Get too many people in there
with liberal ideas

15:44.204 --> 15:46.249
and, well, you get 19.

15:46.293 --> 15:48.599
- What's wrong with 19?
- What <i>isn't</i> wrong with 19?

15:48.643 --> 15:49.644
- Dad.
- Another Manhattan, dear?

15:49.687 --> 15:51.385
- No, thank you.
- Okay.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.082
I think it all stems
from Pruitt Herrera.

15:53.126 --> 15:55.041
Frankly, he let his house
run rampant.

15:55.084 --> 15:58.566
And now what you have is
a bunch of entitled millennials.

15:58.609 --> 15:59.828
I'll take another, Kit.

15:59.871 --> 16:01.047
Could I get
a please on that?

16:01.090 --> 16:02.874
Pretty please,
pretty Kitty.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.833
Oh, see?
That's not so hard.

16:04.876 --> 16:07.140
At least McCallister came up
through the ranks.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.532
He respected the history,

16:08.576 --> 16:11.274
although he had
his own problems.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.581
If I'm being honest,
the whole department

16:13.624 --> 16:15.322
has been flailing
since I retired.

16:15.365 --> 16:17.193
Retired? Oh.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.021
I thought you left because
of the charges against you.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.937
Trav. D-Dad,
I think what Trav means --

16:21.981 --> 16:25.332
Oh, I-I-I know
what he's trying to do.

16:25.375 --> 16:28.596
But the charges were dropped
and my pension was reinstated,

16:28.639 --> 16:32.556
so it's just as though
I had retired.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.036
Right.
Yes, of course.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.907
The old boys' club working
just the way

16:35.951 --> 16:37.387
it's supposed to,
right?

16:37.431 --> 16:39.520
Okay, uh, Mom, yeah,
I think dinner must be ready.

16:39.563 --> 16:40.782
Yeah, right, right.
I think the potatoes

16:40.825 --> 16:41.913
should be ready, honey.

16:41.957 --> 16:42.958
- Great, yeah.
- Potatoes.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.742
Yeah, so...

16:49.138 --> 16:52.315
Sullivan, place is like
a maze with low visibility.

16:52.359 --> 16:55.014
Where is
the stairwell located?

16:55.057 --> 16:56.537
<i>East wall,</i>
<i>side of the hall,</i>

16:56.580 --> 16:58.278
through the double doors.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.019
We need to get water
on that vehicle

17:00.062 --> 17:01.846
and keep water on it
until it cools.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.152
We don't want
the lithium batteries

17:03.196 --> 17:05.154
<i>or the fuel tank</i>
<i>to catch fire.</i>

17:05.198 --> 17:07.113
Copy.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.288
That way.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.596
Got it.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.166
- I got it, I got it.
- What?

17:17.210 --> 17:18.559
I got it.
O-Okay, okay.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.738
Come on.
Pretend it's Chief Ross.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.435
I'm not --

17:25.479 --> 17:27.394
Chief Ross.

17:29.439 --> 17:31.354
Screw you!

17:31.398 --> 17:35.924
I should be captain
of 19!

17:37.186 --> 17:38.753
Ugh!
Yeah, whoo!

17:41.234 --> 17:43.845
So -- So, he's all amped up
after we knocked down the fire,

17:43.888 --> 17:45.629
right, and he's all --
he starts strutting around,

17:45.673 --> 17:47.240
walking around like --
like he won a Super Bowl
or something, right?

17:47.283 --> 17:48.371
- You know what saying?
- Flexing.

17:48.415 --> 17:49.894
Flexing. Flexing.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.113
And out of nowhere --
bam! --

17:51.157 --> 17:53.985
Maddox disappears
into the open septic...

17:54.029 --> 17:55.378
which had not been
emptied yet.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.424
Oh!

17:57.467 --> 17:59.382
Oh, what are
we talking about?

17:59.426 --> 18:02.124
Hey, guys, uh, Cap, Ruiz,
this is Jeremy.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.952
We were in the --
the academy together,

18:03.995 --> 18:06.650
but now he's a big shot at 42
in Oregon.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.348
Hey, man.

18:08.391 --> 18:09.653
Yeah, thanks for letting me
crash the commiserating.

18:09.697 --> 18:10.828
Hey, uh, Herrera's buying
tonight,

18:10.872 --> 18:12.439
so you picked
a good one.

18:12.482 --> 18:13.788
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

18:13.831 --> 18:15.659
It's the first round.
The first round.

18:15.703 --> 18:18.619
Oh, my God.
This is my song.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.360
Same.
Come on.

18:20.403 --> 18:22.971
Girl.
Hey!

18:30.587 --> 18:32.850
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

18:34.896 --> 18:37.072
Ooh, sorry.
Sorry.

18:38.465 --> 18:39.422
Jeremy.

18:39.466 --> 18:41.076
Andy.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.643
Andy.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.384
Nice to meet you.
You, too.

18:44.427 --> 18:45.602
Likewise.

18:45.646 --> 18:48.910
Whoo!
I love you, man!

18:48.953 --> 18:50.694
- I love you, too!
- I love you, John!

18:50.738 --> 18:52.435
I love you!
Whoo!

18:55.090 --> 18:57.048
Abby!

18:57.092 --> 18:59.007
Hello?!
Jonny!

18:59.050 --> 19:00.487
<i>Incident Command</i>
<i>to search and rescue --</i>

19:00.530 --> 19:02.097
<i>any word</i>
<i>on your primary search?</i>

19:02.141 --> 19:03.925
Yeah,
second floor's clear.

19:03.968 --> 19:07.494
We're still searching for
the two missing civilians.

19:07.537 --> 19:10.497
If you don't find them soon,
I need you on fire attack.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.281
Unh-unh. No, we are not gonna
go back up there

19:12.325 --> 19:15.197
to that broken mother
without her kids.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.373
Okay, keep you posted.

19:20.985 --> 19:23.205
What?!

19:23.249 --> 19:25.033
It's just dancing.

19:25.076 --> 19:27.078
Uh-huh, yeah.
It's never just dancing.

19:27.122 --> 19:29.429
Oh, "it's never just dancing."
Mm.

19:32.214 --> 19:35.086
Ugh, this stupid no-sex pact.

19:35.130 --> 19:36.740
Yell, well, you realize
you only have yourself

19:36.784 --> 19:38.307
- to blame for that.
- Well, you know what?

19:38.351 --> 19:42.355
Sadly, it's actually given me
so much clarity.

19:42.398 --> 19:46.489
Like, without any entanglements
and complications,

19:46.533 --> 19:50.493
I see what I want and need
so much more clearly now.

19:50.537 --> 19:53.714
Like, if I had tried talking
to Chief Ross before the pact,

19:53.757 --> 19:55.803
it would've been even more
disastrous.

19:55.846 --> 19:59.241
Even more disastrous?

19:59.285 --> 20:03.114
Oh. No, I meant, like,
if I had tried talking

20:03.158 --> 20:05.639
to Chief Ross about my future
before the pact,

20:05.682 --> 20:08.990
it would've gone badly.

20:09.033 --> 20:10.600
When did you talk to her?

20:10.644 --> 20:12.602
After you told me to go after
what I wanted.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.256
What did you say?

20:16.476 --> 20:17.955
I just -- I

20:17.999 --> 20:19.392
I was -- I was honest.

20:19.435 --> 20:22.786
I told her that Aquino
was coming back

20:22.830 --> 20:25.659
and that means I would've been
bumped to lieutenant

20:25.702 --> 20:27.530
and if I'm gonna be
a lieutenant anywhere,

20:27.574 --> 20:30.620
I'd rather it be at 19.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.492
No, I-I told her

20:32.535 --> 20:35.190
I was proud of the changes
I made at 23,

20:35.234 --> 20:37.540
but it would've been hard
to see it revert back

20:37.584 --> 20:39.020
to a boys' club.

20:39.063 --> 20:41.501
So you told her that 23
was a lost cause?

20:41.544 --> 20:45.287
I didn't sa-- No, Theo,
I was just honest. I --

20:45.331 --> 20:48.421
So you wanting to go back to
your precious 19

20:48.464 --> 20:50.161
is the reason 23
got shut down?

20:50.205 --> 20:51.380
What?

20:59.301 --> 21:01.738
So you're the one
who got us shut down?

21:01.782 --> 21:04.045
- No, that is not what I said.
- Okay, then what did you say?

21:04.088 --> 21:06.308
'Cause if Ruiz
is calling you out, then --

21:06.352 --> 21:08.789
Hey, ladies, we are
commiserating here.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.443
We are not fighting.

21:10.486 --> 21:11.705
Unless it's with Jell-o.

21:11.748 --> 21:12.749
Hello.
Hello.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.100
Okay, what's happening?

21:16.144 --> 21:17.885
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
- Stop it.

21:17.928 --> 21:20.888
We all deserve to know
the truth.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.542
So you can tell them
or I will.

21:27.764 --> 21:32.073
Look, okay, I-I-I talked
to Chief Ross

21:32.116 --> 21:36.077
before the station shut down,
and I asked her if --

21:36.120 --> 21:38.993
I asked her to transfer me back
to 19 as a lieutenant, alright?

21:40.777 --> 21:43.258
Aquino was coming back anyway,
and I decided

21:43.302 --> 21:46.522
McCallister's punishment
had gone on long enough.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.916
Look, I didn't ask
to be at 23.

21:48.959 --> 21:52.006
I didn't ask to be in charge
of changing decades

21:52.049 --> 21:54.443
of toxicity and misogyny,
alright?

21:54.487 --> 21:58.055
- Whoa.
- I-I-I had done my part,
and I was ready to go home.

21:58.099 --> 22:00.319
But you were supposed to be
our -- our captain.

22:00.362 --> 22:03.017
I-I didn't tell her
to close it.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.671
And after she decided to,
I tried to fight --

22:04.714 --> 22:07.282
You sold us out to leverage your
way back to the Girl Scouts.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.371
That is...

22:09.415 --> 22:12.592
You know, you constantly preach
- that we are a team.
- That --

22:12.635 --> 22:14.681
We have each other's backs,
right?

22:14.724 --> 22:17.379
But the first chance you get,
you just stab us in ours.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.163
That is not --Some freaking captain
you are.

22:19.207 --> 22:20.643
Hey, 23,
let's go somewhere else.

22:20.687 --> 22:21.644
Come on.

22:21.688 --> 22:23.298
Hey, Jer, you coming?

22:23.342 --> 22:26.345
Dude, she just said she tried to
protect you all.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.912
You think an interim captain
really has the power to --

22:28.956 --> 22:31.959
to shut down
an entire station?

22:32.002 --> 22:33.308
I'm gonna finish
my beer, man.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.570
Whatever.

22:34.614 --> 22:37.094
Hey, Theo,
hey, you know that...

22:47.670 --> 22:52.283
Jonny?! Abby?!

22:52.327 --> 22:53.459
Jonny!

22:53.502 --> 22:55.112
Call out
if you can hear me!

22:55.156 --> 22:57.288
Jonny!

22:57.332 --> 22:58.464
That poor woman.

22:58.507 --> 23:01.031
The guilt she must feel.

23:01.075 --> 23:03.120
- Abby! Jonny!
- No, d-do you hear that?

23:03.164 --> 23:04.948
- Do you hear that?
- I hear a fire alarm.

23:04.992 --> 23:06.602
No.
No, no no. This way.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.125
Abby! Jonny!

23:08.169 --> 23:09.257
Abby!

23:18.005 --> 23:20.050
Well, of course,
we all loved Alicia.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.096
I was so looking forward

23:22.139 --> 23:23.924
to those gorgeous grandbabies,
but...

23:23.967 --> 23:26.143
Gay couples can have kids,
too, Mom.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.841
You know, one of our lieutenants
and her wife

23:27.884 --> 23:28.929
are about to start
a family.

23:28.972 --> 23:30.365
Is that Bishop? See?

23:30.409 --> 23:32.193
Lesbians everywhere.

23:32.236 --> 23:34.804
Well, I do suppose
it's a little easier for them,

23:34.848 --> 23:35.805
uterus and all.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.546
Kitty, not at the table.

23:37.590 --> 23:40.288
Dick, the word uterus
is not a provocative word.

23:40.331 --> 23:41.681
Uterus. Uterus. Uterus.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.378
You know, I still want
to have kids one day.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.424
Yeah, I'm open to it
with the right person.

23:47.251 --> 23:51.081
B-- Um, I mean, we've -- we've
never talked about it, so...

23:51.125 --> 23:54.084
We don't talk
about a lot of things.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.304
Leave it to you, Kit,
to find the sore spot.

23:56.347 --> 24:00.090
What? All I said was
that I'm pro-grandchildren.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.092
But by all means, save us
from this awkward silence.

24:04.921 --> 24:06.836
I was sorry to hear
about Miller.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.839
Thank you, sir.
It's been tough.

24:09.883 --> 24:11.058
I can imagine.
Down a member,

24:11.101 --> 24:13.364
and then you have to pilot
a program

24:13.408 --> 24:14.844
that wasn't even
your baby.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.716
Well, I mean,
actually, I'm --

24:16.759 --> 24:18.848
I'm pretty grateful
Crisis One is thriving.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.154
It's Dean's legacy.

24:20.197 --> 24:21.851
Oh, sure.
I was skeptical at first,

24:21.895 --> 24:24.985
but PD's overall call volume
is down, which is nice.

24:25.028 --> 24:26.856
Oh, honey, you're gonna have to
fake it much better than that

24:26.900 --> 24:28.989
when you're stumping
for mayor.

24:29.032 --> 24:31.295
I'm sorry. What?

24:31.339 --> 24:32.471
You're running
for mayor?

24:34.603 --> 24:36.518
Did you know about this?

24:36.562 --> 24:38.259
Uh, h-he's joking, right?

24:38.302 --> 24:41.001
No, he's not. No.
Tell 'em, honey.

24:41.044 --> 24:43.090
And tell the truth,
about how your first order

24:43.133 --> 24:45.396
of business is to eliminate
this, um,

24:45.440 --> 24:48.182
Crisis One program that
you're pretending to like.

24:48.225 --> 24:49.226
What?

24:49.270 --> 24:51.098
Oh, see, there I go again,

24:51.141 --> 24:52.534
touching on the sore spot.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.536
Why would you kill a program
that's working?

24:56.277 --> 24:58.105
Wow.
You are unbelievable.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.194
Trav, just stop.
Seriously?

25:00.237 --> 25:03.110
You're a founding member
of Crisis One.

25:06.287 --> 25:08.376
Well, I think it's time
we have cake.

25:16.166 --> 25:18.081
- I heard it that time.
- Yeah, yeah,
I think it's this way.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.256
- Think it's this way.
- Jonny, get up.

25:19.300 --> 25:20.823
We have to find Mom.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.521
Abby?! Abby?!
Hey. Hey, hey.

25:22.564 --> 25:24.610
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Hey.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.786
My name is Ben.
This is my friend, Vic.

25:26.829 --> 25:28.788
We're here to help you.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.441
Sullivan, we found
the two civilians.

25:30.485 --> 25:31.965
We're bringing them
up now.

25:32.008 --> 25:33.444
<i>Copy, Hughes.</i>

25:33.488 --> 25:35.272
I tried to get us away
from the fire,

25:35.316 --> 25:37.666
but I couldn't see anything
and then Jonny wouldn't wake up

25:37.710 --> 25:39.059
and I didn't know what
to do.

25:39.102 --> 25:41.583
You did great.
You did so, so great.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.803
Will my brother be okay?

25:43.846 --> 25:46.457
Let's get you
out of here, okay?

25:51.027 --> 25:52.942
Hey, Sullivan.
This is Gibson.

25:52.986 --> 25:54.509
We've arrived
at the vehicle.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.902
We're gonna need an extra set
of hands down here.

26:06.086 --> 26:08.131
Okay, okay.

26:13.615 --> 26:14.921
Aah!

26:22.972 --> 26:24.104
Abby?
You okay?

26:27.629 --> 26:30.414
Let me see.A-Ab-- A-Abby.

26:30.458 --> 26:31.633
- Jonny!
- Abby.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.635
Jonny, you're awake.
I'm here.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.681
No, you're hurt. We got to get
you guys outside, okay?

26:37.421 --> 26:39.510
<i>19, report, what happened?</i>

26:41.817 --> 26:43.732
Yeah, this is Gibson.

26:43.776 --> 26:46.126
Bishop and I were thrown
by the car exploding --

26:46.169 --> 26:47.736
<i>Sending in help.</i>

26:47.780 --> 26:49.172
Sullivan,
Sullivan this is Warren.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.391
I'm one floor up
from the explosion.

26:50.434 --> 26:51.697
- I can help.
- No, no, no, no, no.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.176
Sullivan, this is Hughes,

26:53.220 --> 26:54.917
Warren is evac-ing
two civilian minors.

26:54.961 --> 26:56.571
I'll go down to help Gibson
and Bishop.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.181
You can't let the Millers
be right.

26:58.225 --> 27:00.531
Okay?

27:00.575 --> 27:01.968
Hey, Abby,
how's your head?

27:05.232 --> 27:07.582
You okay?

27:07.626 --> 27:10.324
Hey, you guys good?
What happened?

27:10.367 --> 27:13.153
The fire must have reached
the hybrid's gas tank.

27:13.196 --> 27:14.763
So much for saving
the planet.

27:24.817 --> 27:27.950
Abby! Jonny!
Oh, my God.

27:27.994 --> 27:32.563
Oh, you're okay. Oh.
You're okay.

27:32.607 --> 27:36.306
Oh. What happened?

27:36.350 --> 27:38.657
My babies.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.180
Mom, I'm so sorry.

27:40.223 --> 27:43.096
No, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have left you.

27:43.139 --> 27:45.011
You didn't know there was gonna
be an accident, Mom.

27:45.054 --> 27:47.274
The man is right about that.

27:47.317 --> 27:49.711
Now, here. Take a few breaths
of oxygen for me.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.409
He carried us both out
like we weighed nothing.

27:52.453 --> 27:55.717
- It was so cool.
- Yeah, I was just doing
my job.

27:55.761 --> 27:58.459
Your job is really cool.

27:58.502 --> 28:01.114
I can't thank you enough.

28:01.157 --> 28:03.507
I just had to grab
some chocolate milk.

28:03.551 --> 28:05.509
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am,
I promise you.

28:05.553 --> 28:07.207
They are not gonna remember that
Mom left them in the car.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.165
They're gonna remember
that Mom was exhausted

28:09.209 --> 28:11.472
but made time to still get
the chocolate milk.

28:11.515 --> 28:14.344
Thank you.

28:14.388 --> 28:16.477
But, yeah, don't ever leave
your kids in the car.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.913
Back it up, back it up.

28:17.957 --> 28:20.307
Thanks.

28:23.571 --> 28:25.225
Bishop, Gibson,
we're all done.

28:25.268 --> 28:26.879
You made me look good
in there.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.968
You look happy.
I guess you got what you wanted.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.536
It's just temporary.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.713
Uh-huh.
Until it's not.

28:34.756 --> 28:37.890
And then,
"Oops, sorry, Bishop,

28:37.933 --> 28:40.370
guess I was the better man
for the job."

28:40.414 --> 28:42.808
I'm sorry Chief Ross
isn't reinstating you, Bishop.

28:42.851 --> 28:44.679
You're sorry?

28:44.723 --> 28:46.550
You're the reason I got demoted
in the first place.

28:46.594 --> 28:48.770
Are we rehashing this now,
Bishop?

28:48.814 --> 28:50.293
No.
Sorry, Lieutenant.

28:50.337 --> 28:51.164
It's Captain today.

28:53.601 --> 28:54.733
Sorry, Captain.

28:54.776 --> 28:55.821
Yeah.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.785
Uh, dude,
I know you're hurting.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.395
Like, you feel like you got
something taken away from you --

29:05.439 --> 29:07.180
something you love.

29:07.223 --> 29:09.486
I mean, trust me, I get it.
I mean, this pact with Andy --

29:09.530 --> 29:11.401
Okay, not letting yourself
have sex is not the same thing

29:11.445 --> 29:13.142
as losing your career,
Jack.

29:13.186 --> 29:16.189
Uh, we are both giving up
things we love, huh?

29:16.232 --> 29:18.452
Sex and winning.

29:21.411 --> 29:23.544
Look, all I'm saying is,
don't let your frustrations

29:23.587 --> 29:25.241
get you in even more trouble
than you're already in, okay?

29:25.285 --> 29:27.504
You know,
it doesn't matter.

29:27.548 --> 29:29.158
Chief hates me.

29:29.202 --> 29:30.377
There's no way
I'm gonna rise again.

29:32.118 --> 29:34.468
Hey.

29:34.511 --> 29:36.078
Hey.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.515
If there's anyone I know
who can get knocked down

29:38.559 --> 29:41.823
and then get back up again,
it's you.

29:41.867 --> 29:44.304
I know 'cause
I just saw it happen.

29:55.794 --> 29:56.925
Okay.
Yeah.

29:59.058 --> 30:00.929
So, my first station
down in Oregon

30:00.973 --> 30:03.149
got shut down two months
into my gig there.

30:03.192 --> 30:05.194
It sucks,
but it happens.

30:05.238 --> 30:07.153
And they will get over it and
they will land on their feet

30:07.196 --> 30:08.763
- somewhere else.
- Yeah, right, no, I get --

30:08.807 --> 30:10.112
I get that they're mad.
I was mad.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.810
But I

30:11.853 --> 30:14.029
I don't think I did
- anything wrong.
- Mnh-mnh.

30:14.073 --> 30:16.640
Like, all I did was advocate
for myself,

30:16.684 --> 30:18.860
which, by they way, Ruiz was
the one who told me to do that.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.601
Yeah.

30:20.644 --> 30:23.430
Knowing what you want
and fighting for yourself,

30:23.473 --> 30:24.910
I like that in a woman.

30:24.953 --> 30:26.607
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

30:26.650 --> 30:28.914
Mm.

30:28.957 --> 30:31.960
What else -- What else
do you like in a woman?

30:32.004 --> 30:33.788
A lot of what I'm seeing
right now.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.138
Sorry. Sorry.

30:36.182 --> 30:38.880
I'm sorry.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.882
Does that -- Does that line
normally work for you?

30:40.926 --> 30:42.536
Yeah.
Yeah, it d-- No.

30:42.579 --> 30:43.885
Not really.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.974
Two more shots, please.

30:46.018 --> 30:47.846
Oh, God, no, I don't think
I can do another one.

30:47.889 --> 30:50.718
Oh, no, these are for me.
Got some erasing to do.

30:50.761 --> 30:51.893
Ah, right.

30:51.937 --> 30:53.286
Um, so wait.
Thank you.

30:53.329 --> 30:54.853
So wait. So wait.
So wait. So wait.

30:54.896 --> 30:58.073
Um, there's one thing
I can't get past.

30:58.117 --> 30:59.814
What? Oh, I know.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.076
Some people like conventionally
attractive men.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.296
- Oh, hilarious. No.
- What are you gonna do?

31:03.339 --> 31:07.691
Um, are you -- are you
really friends with Maddox?

31:07.735 --> 31:09.302
That douchebag? No.

31:09.345 --> 31:10.607
I was gonna leave,
pretend I didn't see him,

31:10.651 --> 31:12.044
then I saw
who he was with.

31:12.087 --> 31:13.697
Who?

31:13.741 --> 31:16.178
You.

31:18.659 --> 31:20.617
You did it again.
You did it again.

31:20.661 --> 31:23.403
Okay, I swear
that wasn't a line.

31:23.446 --> 31:24.970
Sure, sure,
sure, sure.
It just happened.

31:28.974 --> 31:29.931
Whoo!

31:29.975 --> 31:31.019
Pretty good, right?

31:31.063 --> 31:32.629
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep.
Two more?

31:32.673 --> 31:34.240
Well, sure. Why not?

31:34.283 --> 31:35.806
Why not?

31:35.850 --> 31:37.286
That's ridiculous.

31:37.330 --> 31:39.201
The voters of Seattle
are not going to elect a man

31:39.245 --> 31:41.421
who has a record
of public corruption.

31:41.464 --> 31:43.814
Bleeding hearts only
bleed until crime shows up

31:43.858 --> 31:46.600
on their doorstep or
the homeless set up
camp on their street.

31:46.643 --> 31:49.255
Then they clamor for
law and order, and that's me.

31:49.298 --> 31:51.387
Good luck winning votes by
attacking the fire department.

31:51.431 --> 31:52.954
I'll show them that
it's out of control,

31:52.998 --> 31:55.217
that it's cowed
to the woke mob.

31:55.261 --> 31:57.002
Instead of focusing
on fire safety,

31:57.045 --> 31:58.699
it's treating
homeless crazies,

31:58.742 --> 32:00.919
paying for
a roving knife-mobile,

32:00.962 --> 32:02.224
and operating
a free clinic.

32:02.268 --> 32:04.357
You know,
those programs save lives.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.186
We show up and provide
quality care to the community,

32:07.229 --> 32:10.102
and we do it unarmed
and without a threat.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.581
So, you guys gonna have
some cake, or...

32:11.625 --> 32:12.887
That money could be
better used

32:12.931 --> 32:14.193
to increase public safety.

32:14.236 --> 32:15.542
Talking about PD, right?

32:15.585 --> 32:17.500
Because you guys need
more money?

32:17.544 --> 32:20.112
Whereas we could use the money
for mental health services

32:20.155 --> 32:24.116
or making the streets safer or
expanding public transportation.

32:24.159 --> 32:26.553
Please, spare me your
- "defund the police" propaganda.
- What else do
you guys need?

32:26.596 --> 32:27.597
What are you missing?
A couple of tanks

32:27.641 --> 32:29.164
and a battle ship?
Trav --

32:29.208 --> 32:30.949
Since when do you care
about saving lives?

32:30.992 --> 32:32.907
Didn't you just let a guy
light himself on fire

32:32.951 --> 32:34.387
during one of
your crisis calls?

32:34.430 --> 32:36.563
Actually, we saved that man
from killing himself.

32:36.606 --> 32:39.218
Yeah, and humiliated my son
in the process.

32:39.261 --> 32:40.654
Trav, just stop, okay?
It's not worth it.

32:40.697 --> 32:42.612
Come on, Montgomery.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.963
You've been in FD for what,
a decade?

32:45.006 --> 32:47.269
You're clearly
a career firefighter

32:47.313 --> 32:50.011
who lacks any ambition
to climb to the top,

32:50.055 --> 32:52.274
which seems to stem
from some lack of commitment

32:52.318 --> 32:55.669
to something or someone
other than himself.

32:55.712 --> 32:57.236
Dick.
Dad.

32:57.279 --> 33:00.543
Or maybe you just prefer
to stay in the shallow end,

33:00.587 --> 33:02.676
where nobody expects
anything of you.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.025
Yeah.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.549
As opposed to you,

33:06.593 --> 33:09.378
who continually fails
his way upward.

33:09.422 --> 33:10.640
You are not a leader.

33:10.684 --> 33:12.991
You are a mediocre
company man

33:13.034 --> 33:15.036
who thinks power is gained
by grinding down

33:15.080 --> 33:16.429
everyone around him.

33:16.472 --> 33:17.821
Even your own son
hates you.

33:17.865 --> 33:19.780
Travis.
Trenton.

33:19.823 --> 33:24.045
My son was on a path,
and you took him off that path.

33:24.089 --> 33:26.047
He wasn't even gay
till he met you...

33:26.091 --> 33:27.744
What? No.
Travis didn't make me gay.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.616
Nobody makes anybody gay.

33:29.659 --> 33:31.052
...and now
he's a laughingstock.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.011
The only laughingstock
in this room is you.

33:33.054 --> 33:35.143
If I'm a laughingstock,
it's 'cause you're my father.

33:35.187 --> 33:36.884
- What?
- No. Do it.

33:36.927 --> 33:37.972
Look, Trav, I don't need you
to fight this fight

33:38.016 --> 33:38.973
- for me, okay?
- Clearly you do

33:39.017 --> 33:40.235
because it's
the first time tonight

33:40.279 --> 33:41.845
that you've actually stood up
to him.

33:41.889 --> 33:44.109
Oh, wow.
Oh, wow.

33:44.152 --> 33:46.850
See? There it is.

33:46.894 --> 33:47.938
That's how you think of me.

33:47.982 --> 33:50.071
No. That's not...

33:56.034 --> 33:58.297
- Mmm.
- Oh, you're not even
gonna heat it up?

33:58.340 --> 34:00.212
You're not worried about,
like, salmonella?

34:00.255 --> 34:02.083
I just inhaled smoke
from a lithium battery fire.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.346
You think I'm worried
about salmonella?

34:08.133 --> 34:09.525
Sullivan, I'm --

34:09.569 --> 34:11.049
We're good, Bishop.

34:11.092 --> 34:12.528
We're cool.

34:14.965 --> 34:17.838
You know what? No.

34:17.881 --> 34:20.275
No, they -- they -- they do not
- get to steal my joy.
- Hmm?

34:20.319 --> 34:22.451
Miranda always says no one
can steal your joy,

34:22.495 --> 34:24.584
but all I do is let people
steal my joy.

34:26.890 --> 34:28.327
We got Pru.

34:28.370 --> 34:30.242
- What?
- Yeah. Full custody.

34:30.285 --> 34:32.113
- Congrats.
- Yeah.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.463
Yeah, the Millers
get to visit on holidays.

34:34.507 --> 34:35.812
Congratulations.

34:35.856 --> 34:37.901
Yeah, baby.

34:37.945 --> 34:38.728
So, wait, does this --

34:38.772 --> 34:40.034
Oh. No catch. No catch.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.122
They're not gonna --

34:41.166 --> 34:43.124
No,
I'm calling their bluff.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.256
Yeah, and they're just gonna
have to deal with it.

34:44.299 --> 34:45.996
Yeah, firehouse baby!

34:46.040 --> 34:47.346
They do not get to
steal my joy.

34:48.912 --> 34:51.654
I feel I owe you all
an explanation.

34:51.698 --> 34:54.135
I wasn't on the call
because earlier this evening,

34:54.179 --> 34:56.006
I was accused of drinking
on the job.

34:58.313 --> 35:00.185
They were baseless accusations,
of course,

35:00.228 --> 35:03.797
and I came out clean, because
I do not drink on the job.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.539
However, I have it
on pretty good authority

35:06.582 --> 35:08.932
that it was someone in this
firehouse -- not saying who --

35:08.976 --> 35:10.369
that submitted the tip.

35:10.412 --> 35:13.502
And while I thank you

35:13.546 --> 35:16.026
While I thank you for your
concern, I can't help but think,

35:16.070 --> 35:19.726
how can I expect my team
to follow me into a fire

35:19.769 --> 35:22.511
if they don't even think I can
get through a puny 24-hour shift

35:22.555 --> 35:24.339
without taking to the bottle?

35:24.383 --> 35:26.950
So
in order to ensure your safety

35:26.994 --> 35:29.605
and the safety
of your community,

35:29.649 --> 35:35.176
I think it's best for all of us
that you get in fighting shape.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.786
But what's hap--
what's happening?

35:36.830 --> 35:38.919
What's happening
is intervals.

35:38.962 --> 35:40.703
In the barn. Right now.

35:40.747 --> 35:42.314
N-Now?

35:42.357 --> 35:45.143
But, sir, it's --
it's almost midnight.

35:45.186 --> 35:47.188
- Been going all day.
- We haven't even
finished dinner yet.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.494
You don't want to be
the last one out, Bishop,

35:48.537 --> 35:50.409
if your captain's a drunk.

35:50.452 --> 35:52.715
Sir, um, none of us accused you
of drinking on the job.

35:52.759 --> 35:54.195
No, you don't know that
to be true, Warren.

35:54.239 --> 35:55.501
One of you did.
Until that one of you

35:55.544 --> 35:57.024
comes forward and admits
you made false claims,

35:57.067 --> 35:59.896
then intervals.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.289
Now!

36:04.249 --> 36:06.381
There goes my joy.

36:13.954 --> 36:15.260
I'll give you two
a moment, okay?

36:15.303 --> 36:16.783
Thanks.

36:27.054 --> 36:29.622
I'm really sorry.

36:29.665 --> 36:33.016
I should've let you stand up
for yourself.

36:33.060 --> 36:36.368
You said I reminded you
of your dad.

36:36.411 --> 36:39.675
Well, it turns out,
you remind me of mine.

36:39.719 --> 36:42.548
I think we both know that
we shouldn't be together, Trav.

36:42.591 --> 36:48.554
But, uh, I think we're both
just so afraid of letting go.

36:48.597 --> 36:52.384
I mean, you -- you told everyone
in a two-block radius

36:52.427 --> 36:55.865
that you didn't want to be with
me and I just...

36:55.909 --> 36:59.869
came running right back to you
like a sad little puppy.

36:59.913 --> 37:03.656
Just like I do
with my dad.

37:03.699 --> 37:06.659
I, uh --
I applied to an art program.

37:06.702 --> 37:09.270
In Florence.

37:09.314 --> 37:12.708
I didn't tell you 'cause I
didn't think I'd get in,

37:12.752 --> 37:15.276
and -- and things were weird
between us at that time,

37:15.320 --> 37:20.107
but, uh...I got in.

37:20.150 --> 37:21.500
That's amazing.

37:21.543 --> 37:23.632
Yeah, yeah.
I honestly can't believe it.

37:23.676 --> 37:26.592
Why?
Your work's incredible.

37:26.635 --> 37:29.159
You don't have to be nice
to me now.

37:29.203 --> 37:31.901
I guess, um, I can't believe
I even applied.

37:31.945 --> 37:34.556
You know,
it's so unlike me.

37:37.255 --> 37:44.566
Emmett, you are one
of the most beautiful,

37:44.610 --> 37:50.093
amazing, generous,
bravest souls

37:50.137 --> 37:53.749
I've ever been lucky enough
to know.

37:53.793 --> 37:56.012
I wish you treated me
like it.

37:59.102 --> 38:03.150
But I wouldn't have
got this far

38:03.193 --> 38:07.023
if you hadn't been
in my life, so...

38:07.067 --> 38:08.895
I guess
I have to thank you.

38:10.940 --> 38:14.944
I am so sorry
for so much.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.648
You should go.

38:22.691 --> 38:24.084
Yeah.

38:26.695 --> 38:30.569
Will you tell
your parents I said...

38:30.612 --> 38:33.441
thanks?
I won't.

38:37.227 --> 38:39.012
I really do care
about you.

38:39.055 --> 38:40.405
Yeah, I know.

38:43.059 --> 38:44.931
Bye, Trav.

39:01.034 --> 39:03.819
Hughes, are you good?

39:03.863 --> 39:05.908
Hughes? Hughes?

39:05.952 --> 39:08.737
Bishop, I thought you were
an Olympian. Keep it moving.

39:11.218 --> 39:14.439
Okay, Beckett, stop it.
They're getting sick.

39:14.482 --> 39:15.440
They're not even
wearing turnouts,

39:15.483 --> 39:17.398
they can't be tired yet.

39:17.442 --> 39:20.096
Alright, fine, it was me.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.750
- What's that, Sullivan?
- It was me!

39:21.794 --> 39:24.144
I accused you of drinking

39:24.187 --> 39:25.754
because I found booze
in your office,

39:25.798 --> 39:27.277
which I was looking for

39:27.321 --> 39:29.628
because I thought
you were getting sloppy.

39:29.671 --> 39:31.325
And I was right.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.328
No, in fact, you were wrong.
I'm clean. Wow.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.852
The new chief takes a chance on
you, gives you a promotion.

39:36.896 --> 39:39.377
This is how
you repay her?

39:39.420 --> 39:42.205
Can't be very good for
your rapport, now, can it?

39:42.249 --> 39:45.208
Thank you for your honesty,
Sullivan.

39:45.252 --> 39:46.819
I appreciate it.

39:46.862 --> 39:49.691
I'm sorry.
Sorry you doubted me.

39:49.735 --> 39:51.345
Hit the showers,
everyone.

39:55.305 --> 39:58.744
I knew you were ruthless,
but I didn't know

39:58.787 --> 40:00.441
you were that ruthless,
man.

40:02.269 --> 40:04.097
I...

40:05.751 --> 40:08.536
Warren.
Come on.

40:16.022 --> 40:17.502
Totally. Oop.

40:19.155 --> 40:20.113
Watch your step.
Watch your step.

40:20.156 --> 40:21.897
Okay, I definitely
cannot drive.

40:21.941 --> 40:23.290
No,
I'll get you an Uber.

40:23.333 --> 40:24.813
No, it's okay.
I-I can get my own.

40:24.857 --> 40:26.380
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.470
Or --
Or we could share one.

40:31.516 --> 40:32.821
What?

40:32.865 --> 40:35.302
Okay, I-I have a pact.

40:35.345 --> 40:37.826
Oh, yeah?
Like a pinky promise?
Mm-hmm.

40:39.741 --> 40:41.961
Ooh!
Um yeah.

40:42.004 --> 40:45.878
A-A pinky promise to a friend
that I won't sleep with anyone.

40:45.921 --> 40:47.749
Well, is this friend
a boyfriend?

40:47.793 --> 40:51.318
No, just a friend
who has my back.

40:51.361 --> 40:52.537
And...

40:54.147 --> 40:57.411
And we -- we've decided
to try celibacy.

40:57.455 --> 40:58.630
Hoo!

41:00.545 --> 41:02.503
Okay, well, then you really
shouldn't be kissing me

41:02.547 --> 41:03.548
in a parking lot.

41:06.768 --> 41:08.422
Okay, sorry. No.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.555
I'm gonna --
I'm gonna stay strong.

41:10.598 --> 41:12.470
As cute as you are.

41:12.513 --> 41:14.559
But if you give me your number,
I mean, we --

41:14.602 --> 41:16.517
when the pact is over,
I, you know --

41:16.561 --> 41:20.608
Okay, why -- why -- why would
you kiss me in a parking lot

41:20.652 --> 41:23.219
if you have this --
this "pact"?

41:23.263 --> 41:25.657
Well, um,
because you're hot.

41:25.700 --> 41:27.528
And I like you.

41:27.572 --> 41:30.009
And you forced me
to have fun

41:30.052 --> 41:32.402
when I was having
a really crappy night.

41:32.446 --> 41:35.014
But, um, now
I got to get home.

41:35.057 --> 41:38.060
So...
Wow. Okay.

41:38.104 --> 41:41.368
Yeah, alright.
It was fun hanging out.

41:41.411 --> 41:42.848
Come on, Andy.
We were having a good time.

41:42.891 --> 41:44.153
Yeah --
Come here.

41:44.197 --> 41:46.155
And now it's time
to go home.

41:47.548 --> 41:49.463
Why are you being
such a bitch?

41:49.507 --> 41:52.292
Why are you being
such an ass?

41:52.335 --> 41:54.250
- Come on, you can stop the game.
- What are you doing?

41:54.294 --> 41:55.730
I'm not playing a game.
What are you doing?

41:55.774 --> 41:58.167
I said get --Come on.

42:04.652 --> 42:06.349
No. Stop it.
