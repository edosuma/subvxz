01:15.325 --> 01:17.994
DIVORCE BY MUTUAL CONSENT
CHANG YEONG-GUK, YEO HWA-JEONG

01:20.497 --> 01:24.125
<i>We all have moments we regret in life.</i>

01:54.114 --> 01:58.201
DEMO OF <i>THE END AND THE BEGINNING</i>,
OH YOON'S 2ND ALBUM

02:47.750 --> 02:49.085
<i>Nevertheless,</i>

02:49.669 --> 02:53.673
<i>we can never turn back the clock.</i>

02:58.970 --> 03:01.639
TWO WEEKS AGO

03:01.723 --> 03:04.642
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

03:04.726 --> 03:07.270
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.980
EPISODE 2

03:19.073 --> 03:20.950
Look. Sweet, isn't it?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.494
Open your clinic here

03:23.578 --> 03:26.497
and your patients will heal
just by looking out the window.

03:26.581 --> 03:27.832
The view sure is nice.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.752
Nothing beats this
when it comes to good feng shui.

03:30.835 --> 03:33.087
Mountain in the back
and water in the front.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.507
I see the ocean, but where's the mountain?

03:36.591 --> 03:40.053
Have you forgotten about the hill
that's behind the marketplace?

03:41.971 --> 03:44.140
If you're done, let's go. I'm a busy man.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.602
Hold your horses.
I have a long checklist to go through.

03:48.186 --> 03:51.564
Good water pressure and sunlight
are essential.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.860
Does this air conditioner work?

03:55.944 --> 03:59.322
It doesn't.
I see you're the exhausting type.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.032
No, I'm just thorough.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.659
What's this?

04:04.077 --> 04:05.286
The storage room.

04:07.580 --> 04:11.125
Where will we check out next?
Is it far from here?

04:12.418 --> 04:13.753
This is the only one.

04:15.129 --> 04:16.756
You said we should get going.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.759
Yes, to check out the house
for you to live in.

04:20.885 --> 04:23.513
Then this is the only one
you have to show me?

04:23.596 --> 04:24.597
Yes.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.446
Two bedrooms and one…

04:41.239 --> 04:42.490
One bathroom.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.326
An air-conditioner, gas stove, washer,

04:46.202 --> 04:47.912
and even a dryer are provided.

04:48.663 --> 04:51.749
Who uses this kind of wallpaper
these days?

04:52.625 --> 04:56.504
Sweet, isn't it?
A tropical vibe with contrasting colors.

04:57.255 --> 05:00.925
An eco-friendly atmosphere. Don't you
think it'll put you on a flowery path?

05:01.718 --> 05:04.679
The interior design isn't my style at all.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.515
What exactly is your style then?

05:08.891 --> 05:11.019
-As if that changes anything.
-Let's hear it.

05:11.102 --> 05:15.982
Well… An overall vibe that incorporates
an antique, simple, and European style.

05:16.649 --> 05:21.195
Wainscot paneling on the walls
and porcelain tiles on the floor.

05:21.279 --> 05:26.326
Spanish tiles in the foyer
and light fixtures from Denmark would do.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.829
I doubt you understood any of it.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.998
How about some new wallpaper instead?

05:32.081 --> 05:34.208
Off-white like teeth would be nice.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.627
Let's sign the contract.

05:38.379 --> 05:42.216
Hold on. What did you say
will be provided other than the washer?

05:42.300 --> 05:43.384
A dryer!

05:43.468 --> 05:45.553
Are you saying you own

05:45.636 --> 05:48.681
both the office building and apartment?

05:48.765 --> 05:49.849
That's right.

05:49.932 --> 05:52.852
Am I the only one
who finds this suspicious?

05:52.935 --> 05:54.729
-What do you mean?
-Just think about it.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.274
When she found out
I'd open a dental clinic here,

05:58.357 --> 05:59.859
she introduced me to you,

05:59.942 --> 06:02.528
and the office space
you showed me is hers.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.739
How is this a coincidence?

06:06.699 --> 06:10.203
You're not scamming me
because I'm not from around here, right?

06:11.329 --> 06:15.583
Doctor, I get how this
might seem suspicious to you,

06:16.167 --> 06:18.544
but ask anyone in this town.

06:18.628 --> 06:21.130
Everyone knows who we are.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.048
Exactly.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.758
We could never scam anyone.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.470
I'm on government payroll, you see.

06:27.553 --> 06:31.015
How can you be when you
obviously own a restaurant?

06:31.682 --> 06:33.810
I guess it's my turn this time.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.607
YEO HWA-JEONG, ZONE CHIEF

06:39.690 --> 06:40.858
Zone chief?

06:40.942 --> 06:44.028
That's right. The government pays me
300,000 won a month.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.696
And 20,000 won more for a meeting.

06:45.780 --> 06:49.158
Chief Hong is a regular chief.
Only 50,000 a year.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.620
Forget it. She still doesn't believe you,
so let's give her better proof.

06:52.703 --> 06:55.331
See how much of a bargain you're getting.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.709
GONGJIN, CHUNG-HO

06:59.961 --> 07:01.504
The office space you just saw

07:01.587 --> 07:04.465
is the unit she had saved
for her second restaurant.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.802
But she offered it to you
because she thought

07:07.885 --> 07:11.097
it'd benefit the whole town
if you opened a dental clinic.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.641
Hey, stop that. That's not necessary.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.602
She should know, though.
Forget it if you don't want it.

07:26.070 --> 07:28.781
All right. Take a copy each.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.659
Now that the contract has been signed,

07:31.742 --> 07:35.163
you will fulfill your duties
as landlady and tenant.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.789
Good job.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.041
-How many hours did you work today?
-Four.

07:42.378 --> 07:44.088
So, for four hours…

07:45.256 --> 07:46.215
Here.

07:47.216 --> 07:50.511
I got that number too. I'll wire
the money. Coins can be a nuisance.

07:50.595 --> 07:51.888
Much appreciated.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.476
It's fine. You don't have to see us out.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.326
Why are you following me?

08:14.285 --> 08:18.206
You sure are dense, aren't you?
Do I really have to tell you?

08:18.915 --> 08:19.790
What do you mean?

08:19.874 --> 08:22.710
You need to pay me.
17,440 won for my service.

08:23.377 --> 08:24.962
Did you say 17,440 won?

08:26.214 --> 08:29.175
Listen up. Whatever the task,
I go by minimum wage.

08:29.258 --> 08:33.095
I'm sure you know. The minimum wage
in 2021 is 8,720 won per hour.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.390
I worked 4 hours, which is 34,880 won.

08:36.974 --> 08:40.019
And it should be evenly split
between you and Ms. Yeo.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.566
I only have big notes.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.443
I always have change ready.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.654
All right.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.031
Take 2,000 won first.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.493
And here's 560 won.

08:57.703 --> 08:58.788
Are we done now?

08:58.871 --> 09:02.416
Don't you need renovating?
I do that for minimum wage too.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.460
As if anyone could do it.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.129
I mentioned my high standards earlier.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.680
What are they?

09:18.224 --> 09:22.019
Wallpaper and painting,
cement work, tiles, heating,

09:22.103 --> 09:23.104
even plumbing?

09:23.187 --> 09:24.188
CERTIFIED PLUMBER

09:24.814 --> 09:26.107
I'll consider myself hired.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.866
He's so weird.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.370
Did you say Gongjin?

09:40.371 --> 09:41.706
Where the heck is that?

09:42.331 --> 09:44.959
Gongjin, Chung-ho City, Gangwon Province.

09:45.042 --> 09:48.921
You're nuts. How are you going
to live in such hicksville?

09:49.005 --> 09:51.632
I'm in the middle
of drawing a big picture.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.928
Take a look. Awesome, right?

09:56.012 --> 09:58.014
PRIVATE CLINIC DOCTORS
EARN MORE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE

09:59.015 --> 10:01.601
So you're moving there just to earn money?

10:02.685 --> 10:03.978
Well,

10:05.062 --> 10:06.647
I can't find a job here,

10:06.731 --> 10:09.108
and it's impossible
to open a clinic in Seoul.

10:09.900 --> 10:13.154
This could fatten my bank account
in a short period of time.

10:13.946 --> 10:17.366
You still shouldn't have signed the lease
without even telling me.

10:17.867 --> 10:18.701
Sorry.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.662
What can I do when it's already signed?

10:23.289 --> 10:26.667
But why are you packing already?

10:26.751 --> 10:30.838
You need to put this place on the market,
and I'm sure it'll take a while.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.214
It's already sold.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.343
Housing is in high demand these days.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.094
When are you moving then?

10:39.180 --> 10:40.931
-The day after tomorrow.
-Hey!

10:41.599 --> 10:44.894
-My gosh.
-Is someone pointing a gun at you?

10:44.977 --> 10:46.395
What's with the rush?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.856
It just happened that way.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.232
Unbelievable.

10:51.400 --> 10:56.113
I'll be so bored here without you.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.700
We've never been apart
since middle school.

10:59.784 --> 11:00.993
I know.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.667
Mi-seon.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.670
Take this.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.172
This…

11:13.255 --> 11:16.175
It'll look good on you
since you're slender and all.

11:16.258 --> 11:20.930
Forget it! Do you think
I care about this stupid dress right now?

11:21.013 --> 11:22.431
Just don't go. Stay here!

11:22.515 --> 11:26.310
Why are you being like that?
You're making it hard for me to leave.

11:26.394 --> 11:30.189
Don't leave. Just don't go.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.484
-Are you crying?
-I'm not.

11:40.032 --> 11:44.161
Come on. You're making me feel so bad.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.088
Just so you know,
I hate this dress so much.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.259
Give me that one instead. The nice one.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.344
That one's too expensive.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.805
-Cheapskate.
-Just try it on.

12:02.888 --> 12:06.350
-Forget it.
-Darn it.

12:07.768 --> 12:10.104
Just go. Go away to Gongjin.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.344
-I'm good.
-You're doing great today.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.971
MR. YU EXPRESS

12:45.431 --> 12:46.640
What's going on?

12:47.224 --> 12:49.059
-What is it?
-Hey.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.187
What's up? Is there a party somewhere?

12:51.270 --> 12:52.730
Hey, Chun-jae.

12:52.813 --> 12:56.317
It's not Chun-jae.
I told you to address me as Oh Yoon.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.361
-Not according to your birth certificate.
-It's Oh Yoon, damn it.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.322
Fine. Oh Yoon.

13:01.405 --> 13:04.366
Someone's moving into Ms. Yeo's house.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.535
It's a young lady who's a dentist.

13:08.704 --> 13:11.582
Wait. Was she really a dentist?

13:11.665 --> 13:13.584
That girl's actually a dentist?

13:13.667 --> 13:14.543
Do you know her?

13:14.627 --> 13:16.420
Not personally.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.297
You can say there's a debt between us.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.674
A debt? What's that about?

13:20.758 --> 13:24.136
She didn't seem to be dexterous,
so I'm kind of worried.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.847
Why are you all shyly watching from afar?

13:26.931 --> 13:27.848
Hello, Ms. Yeo.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.434
-I see you're here to play landlady.
-She's not looking.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.270
-She always ignores me.
-That goes in the living room.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.271
Doctor.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.940
Hello.

13:37.399 --> 13:38.817
You didn't have to come.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.487
How can I not when you're moving in today?

13:41.987 --> 13:43.864
I see you have a lot of stuff.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.324
Yes.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.037
They all live around here.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.539
I see.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.249
Remember me from the cafe?

13:53.749 --> 13:56.502
They are your neighbors now,
so say hello as you come and go.

13:56.585 --> 13:57.628
-Sure.
-Say hello.

13:57.711 --> 13:59.004
Hello, everyone.

13:59.088 --> 14:02.299
-Where does this go?
-Excuse me.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.344
To the room… No, let me lead the way.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.642
Is she actually moving here?

14:17.815 --> 14:18.941
She's pretty.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.026
She resembles me in some ways.

14:27.658 --> 14:28.868
Hey, Dad.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.287
Yes, the move went smoothly.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.331
I'm still so busy unpacking.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.167
You can visit once the clinic opens.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.004
Sure, and take care of yourself.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.047
Bye.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.250
-Why are you here at this hour?
-To verify your registration.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.008
Are you worried
that I might have falsified my move?

15:26.091 --> 15:29.970
What do you think of the wallpaper?
I chose one of the best ones.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.556
Well, I guess it's not bad.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.643
-So, what is it?
-I have a few things to tell you.

15:35.726 --> 15:38.812
Recyclables are collected
every Wednesday at 9:00 a.m.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.689
-At the end of the alley--
-Hold on.

15:42.524 --> 15:45.277
-Recyclables?
-Bring them to the end of the alley.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.572
Boxes like these
should be taken out the day before.

15:48.656 --> 15:49.740
Got it.

15:49.823 --> 15:52.701
The combination
to the front door lock is 870724.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.203
-So, 87…
-And 0724.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.955
Okay, 0724.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.207
You can change it to whatever you want.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.375
What's this number?

15:59.458 --> 16:00.793
My birthday.

16:01.418 --> 16:04.046
Why is my lock combination your birthday?

16:04.129 --> 16:07.257
Nothing came to mind,
so I used the combination to my door lock.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.510
Why would you tell me that?

16:09.593 --> 16:12.805
Whatever. I didn't hear it.
I already forgot.

16:12.888 --> 16:13.973
I'll throw this away.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.433
You need it if you want
to change the combination.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.978
Really? You should've just said so.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.109
-Are you 35, then?
-Yes.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.362
You're a year older than me.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.281
Was that a hint of affection I heard?

16:31.365 --> 16:32.908
Don't you dare show me any.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.329
Are you nuts? I just got goose bumps.

16:37.413 --> 16:41.291
Same here. All right.
That's all I came to tell you.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.376
Any questions?

16:44.420 --> 16:45.295
Go ahead.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.757
Where can I get
a decent cup of coffee around here?

16:49.800 --> 16:53.178
Taking a coffee to go is
how I start my workday.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.180
There are a few near the harbor,

16:55.264 --> 16:58.017
but that place is closest to your clinic.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.268
Where's it?

16:59.351 --> 17:00.686
The 4,000-won place.

17:01.478 --> 17:02.730
No way.

17:04.064 --> 17:07.526
Let bygones be bygones.
They're your neighbors now.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.903
That's not it.

17:09.987 --> 17:13.240
It's just that the coffee there is awful.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.617
Give it another try.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.454
And the renovation will take a while.
I'll let you know.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.540
Sure. How long will it take, though?

17:21.623 --> 17:22.541
I'll call you.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.334
It can't take too long.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.172
He just left.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.093
Recyclables, Wednesday.

17:33.802 --> 17:37.181
Lock combination, 8707…

17:54.156 --> 17:56.450
You heard a new dental clinic
will open up, right?

17:56.533 --> 17:58.368
Who hasn't heard?

17:58.452 --> 18:00.954
I saw the dentist move in the other day,

18:01.038 --> 18:04.500
and it's someone we all know!

18:04.583 --> 18:08.962
It's the young lady
Chief Hong brought to the gutting deck.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.297
-What?
-Are you sure?

18:10.380 --> 18:12.800
Of course, I am!

18:12.883 --> 18:15.761
So? What's so great about doctors?

18:15.844 --> 18:18.388
My son is an accountant in Seoul.

18:18.472 --> 18:22.684
Not that again.
Everyone in Gongjin knows now.

18:22.768 --> 18:26.605
This is great, though. You've been
having trouble with your teeth,

18:26.688 --> 18:28.273
so visit there once it opens.

18:28.357 --> 18:31.276
You think I'll spend my money
for my damn teeth

18:31.360 --> 18:34.279
when I don't have many days to live?

18:34.363 --> 18:37.324
Tell me about it. That implant thingy

18:37.407 --> 18:40.160
costs as much as a car.

18:40.244 --> 18:44.915
Come on. You know
eating well is most important.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.920
Over there. There's that dentist.

18:50.003 --> 18:51.463
-What?
-What?

18:52.548 --> 18:53.549
Goodness.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.343
Is she…

18:56.426 --> 19:01.265
Did I see that right?
She's only wearing her long johns, right?

19:02.057 --> 19:04.351
Is that what you saw too?

19:04.434 --> 19:07.771
For a second, I thought my mind
was playing tricks on me.

19:07.855 --> 19:11.483
My goodness. What has the world come to?

19:11.567 --> 19:14.653
All of her skin was showing over here.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.196
How embarrassing.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.833
MODERN PHOTO STUDIO

19:34.298 --> 19:37.467
I know a mischievous face when I see one.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.668
Are the renovations over or not?

20:44.034 --> 20:45.285
He did a good job.

20:48.997 --> 20:49.998
It sure is nice.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.638
-Chief Hong!
-What?

21:05.472 --> 21:06.974
There he is.

21:07.891 --> 21:08.725
Hey.

21:19.695 --> 21:23.240
The <i>gamju</i> is sweet and refreshing.
Who made it?

21:23.323 --> 21:25.200
Isn't it obvious? Du-sik, of course.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.202
You know how to make it?

21:27.286 --> 21:29.705
As if there's anything he can't do.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.624
Apart from finding a wife, I mean.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.917
You're absolutely right.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.837
How did the conversation
turn that way all of a sudden?

21:38.422 --> 21:39.548
Chief Hong,

21:40.173 --> 21:42.634
why is this suit out here?

21:43.385 --> 21:44.428
I'm throwing it out.

21:44.511 --> 21:47.264
Why throw away something perfectly fine?

21:47.347 --> 21:48.640
It looks expensive.

21:49.516 --> 21:52.019
Maybe I should give it to my son-in-law.

21:52.102 --> 21:57.399
Unbelievable. How can you give
your son-in-law a hand-me-down?

21:57.482 --> 22:01.737
Hurry with the soap, will you?
I'm a very busy woman.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.071
Okay. How many do you need?

22:03.155 --> 22:05.115
-I'll take two.
-Two it is.

22:05.198 --> 22:06.658
-Four for me.
-Noted.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.535
-I'll take ten.
-Ten?

22:08.618 --> 22:11.246
Ms. Mat-i, you're a big spender!

22:11.330 --> 22:13.415
Nothing beats it
when it comes to rubbing off

22:13.498 --> 22:15.208
the stench of squid and fish.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.878
-Right.
-It's the absolute best.

22:17.961 --> 22:20.339
Is that so? I appreciate
you saying that, ma'am.

22:20.422 --> 22:23.258
I'll continue to sell it
at 500 won a piece.

22:24.259 --> 22:25.427
That reminds me.

22:25.510 --> 22:28.180
The young lady
you brought to the gutting deck

22:28.263 --> 22:30.265
-is a dentist, correct?
-Yes.

22:30.348 --> 22:33.643
My gosh. You won't believe what we saw.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.772
-How can she be that way?
-Why? Did something happen?

22:36.855 --> 22:41.151
A while ago, we saw her running
along the walking trail.

22:41.234 --> 22:43.904
Her outfit couldn't be more raunchy.

22:43.987 --> 22:47.991
Her top barely covered her
while her pants clung to her body.

22:48.075 --> 22:51.703
I could see her sheer bottom
which had me looking away!

22:51.787 --> 22:56.041
How can one run around
wearing something like that?

22:56.124 --> 22:57.584
-How embarrassing.
-Gosh.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.587
I could even see her belly button.

23:00.670 --> 23:04.216
That's just workout gear.
Many people wear that these days.

23:04.299 --> 23:05.842
-What?
-What?

23:11.223 --> 23:13.183
Grab your soap now.

23:13.266 --> 23:16.311
It smells incredible
thanks to the tangerine peel.

23:16.394 --> 23:18.688
Who will take this? Gosh, I dropped one.

23:18.772 --> 23:22.400
This one got crushed.
I'll cut another piece for you.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.278
Two for Ms. Gam-ri.

23:25.362 --> 23:29.324
Ms. Suk-ja wanted four, right?

23:29.407 --> 23:31.868
And ten for Ms. Mat-i. You're so generous.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.495
Why isn't anyone answering me?

23:36.581 --> 23:38.416
Let's see.

23:44.714 --> 23:45.549
Ms. Yeo?

23:45.632 --> 23:48.135
Doctor. Hi, how are you?

23:48.218 --> 23:51.763
Well, my goodness.

23:51.847 --> 23:52.973
I'm still unpacking…

23:53.056 --> 23:56.601
I love what you've done with the place.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.645
It looks totally different.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.899
Can I get you something to drink?

24:02.983 --> 24:05.861
No, it's fine. I have to get going anyway.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.070
I just came by

24:07.154 --> 24:12.159
to invite you to the party
for the elderly we're having tomorrow.

24:12.742 --> 24:15.537
I see. A party for the elderly?

24:15.620 --> 24:18.248
What do you say? Can you make it?

24:18.331 --> 24:20.250
I'd have to check my schedule.

24:20.834 --> 24:23.128
Please stop by even though you're busy.

24:23.211 --> 24:24.963
Greet your neighbors properly

24:25.046 --> 24:27.048
and promote the opening of your clinic.

24:27.883 --> 24:28.717
A promotion?

24:38.602 --> 24:39.436
Here you go.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.939
-Eat lots.
-Sure.

24:57.996 --> 25:01.249
Let's just consider it
fixed and sunk costs.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.668
-What are you standing there?
-Gosh.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.337
I was about to join.

25:07.005 --> 25:10.342
-What's with the camera?
-I'm here to take photos of the party.

25:10.425 --> 25:11.426
By the hour?

25:11.509 --> 25:14.012
Unfortunately, this one's for free.

25:14.095 --> 25:17.057
Don't take my photos.
I value my portrait rights.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.935
Don't worry. I have high standards
when it comes to my models.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.649
Doctor, over here!

25:25.732 --> 25:27.108
Yes, coming.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.452
Welcome.

25:37.535 --> 25:39.537
-Please have a seat.
-Hello.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.415
You remember us, don't you?

25:42.499 --> 25:45.460
Yes, of course.
I was grateful for the other day.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.629
-You're a dentist, right?
-Yes.

25:48.213 --> 25:51.341
I opened a dental clinic
in the building up there.

25:51.424 --> 25:54.010
Please come by if your teeth bother you.

25:54.094 --> 25:56.304
The world has changed
for the better, hasn't it?

25:56.388 --> 25:58.932
Back then, we could barely make do,

25:59.015 --> 26:01.226
so women rarely received higher education.

26:01.309 --> 26:02.394
I see.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.438
Anyway, enjoy the food.

26:05.522 --> 26:08.900
From what I saw the other day,
you could use some food.

26:08.984 --> 26:12.237
Hold on a second. This piece of meat

26:13.280 --> 26:16.241
wrapped in some of this kimchi…

26:17.033 --> 26:19.661
Go ahead. It's really good, you know.

26:19.744 --> 26:21.579
Open wide.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.375
-Here you go.
-I…

26:26.084 --> 26:26.918
There.

26:29.504 --> 26:32.424
What… Why aren't you eating it?

26:32.507 --> 26:33.591
Well, I…

26:34.175 --> 26:36.803
I'll have it later.
I'm not hungry right now, so…

26:36.886 --> 26:41.141
Is it because she used her hands?
They're clean, you know.

26:41.224 --> 26:43.268
No, that's not it.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.565
Doctor, when did you get here?

26:48.648 --> 26:49.941
Ms. Yeo.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.861
Things were so hectic
that I didn't see you arrive.

26:53.653 --> 26:54.904
Hello.

26:54.988 --> 26:57.741
I saw you move in the other day.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.618
I'm the owner of
Gongjin Korean-Chinese Restaurant.

27:01.578 --> 27:03.163
-Hello.
-Right.

27:03.246 --> 27:06.583
Goodness me. How have things been for you?

27:07.709 --> 27:09.210
It turns out

27:09.294 --> 27:13.798
you rented out the house and office space
that are in her name.

27:13.882 --> 27:17.719
A good landlady should be in your cards,
but you ended up with a fussy one.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.638
What are you spewing?

27:20.722 --> 27:22.057
But I'm right.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.142
Everyone knows you're a fussy one.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.145
That's not true.

27:28.229 --> 27:30.857
Doctor, I'm a friendly one, you know.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.902
I gave you a discount on your deposit
since you leased two.

27:33.985 --> 27:37.030
Don't hesitate to let me know
if anything bothers you.

27:37.113 --> 27:39.866
-Actually, there are a few things.
-Goodness.

27:39.949 --> 27:42.702
Do tell. I'll get it sorted immediately.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.121
Is that so? Then could you

27:45.205 --> 27:47.290
change the utility room floor tiles?

27:47.374 --> 27:49.084
Why? Are there any cracks?

27:49.167 --> 27:52.045
Actually, there are some minor cracks

27:52.128 --> 27:54.714
which don't seem pleasant to the eyes.

27:54.798 --> 27:58.051
-There's also a hole in the screen window.
-My gosh.

27:58.134 --> 28:01.137
It's only as big as
a quarter of my pinky fingernail,

28:01.221 --> 28:05.141
but mosquitoes and fruit flies
can still make it in

28:05.225 --> 28:07.519
-which is a nuisance.
-Goodness.

28:07.602 --> 28:10.230
-Also, you sell fish at your restaurant.
-Right.

28:10.313 --> 28:13.650
Maybe you should consider
another way of grilling it.

28:13.733 --> 28:17.404
The smell is quite overpowering, you see.

28:17.487 --> 28:20.657
I'm particularly not fond
of fishy smells, so…

28:20.740 --> 28:21.741
She's not wrong.

28:22.951 --> 28:26.913
Hi, I'm Bo-ra's mother,
the owner of the supermarket nearby.

28:26.996 --> 28:27.997
Hello.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.624
And this is my husband.

28:29.707 --> 28:31.042
-Hello.
-Hi.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.169
-I run the hardware store.
-I see.

28:33.253 --> 28:36.923
-It's nice to have some youth in the town.
-Right.

28:37.006 --> 28:39.342
You didn't buy anything
at the store the other day.

28:39.426 --> 28:41.261
-Really?
-Just come by anytime.

28:41.344 --> 28:46.266
Actually, it's because
I didn't find what I was looking for.

28:46.349 --> 28:48.435
-What?
-What? What didn't we have?

28:48.518 --> 28:50.729
We have more items
than any other place in town.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.689
-She's right.
-It's a shampoo

28:52.772 --> 28:54.441
from a high-end brand,

28:54.524 --> 28:56.359
so I doubt the countryside has it.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.361
Countryside?

28:58.445 --> 29:00.572
I went by just in case, but I was right.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.282
Don't worry about it.

29:02.365 --> 29:05.034
-I bought some online.
-I see.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.829
-Honey, can you…
-Right.

29:07.912 --> 29:08.830
Slow and steady.

29:08.913 --> 29:13.084
Did you manage to get an
internet connection all the way out here?

29:13.168 --> 29:16.087
I should go change the way I grill fish.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.007
I should get going too.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.384
Does the store not have certain items?

29:21.468 --> 29:22.552
We have the essentials.

29:23.386 --> 29:26.347
If your teeth ever bother you…

29:38.109 --> 29:39.986
So you're really a dentist.

29:41.863 --> 29:42.989
Yes.

29:43.573 --> 29:44.449
My gosh.

29:45.241 --> 29:47.786
I shouldn't have gotten
the wrong idea about you.

29:49.287 --> 29:50.371
I apologize.

29:51.748 --> 29:54.334
Let's forget what happened, shall we?

29:54.417 --> 29:58.046
Let me properly introduce myself then.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.340
<i>A sleepless moonlit night</i>

30:00.423 --> 30:01.966
Right, you don't know the song.

30:02.759 --> 30:04.010
Anyway, I'm Oh Yoon.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.679
A singer.

30:06.763 --> 30:07.639
Hello.

30:11.476 --> 30:14.687
This happens to be my first studio album.

30:14.771 --> 30:17.065
Think of it as a welcoming gift.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.650
-For me?
-Yes.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.194
Thank you. It also has my autograph.

30:23.029 --> 30:24.113
Thank you.

30:26.866 --> 30:28.201
Did you enjoy enough food?

30:28.284 --> 30:29.536
Yes, go ahead.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.093
Ms. Yeo, I'll take a bowl
of <i>yukgaejang</i> too.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.263
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

30:48.346 --> 30:50.640
Does the smell of my grilled fish
disgust you?

30:50.723 --> 30:52.225
-Of course not.
-Right?

30:53.017 --> 30:55.562
I always use fresh fish caught daily.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.857
-Did someone say something?
-Forget it.

31:01.609 --> 31:06.114
<i>Greetings. This is the village chief,
Chang Yeong-guk.</i>

31:06.614 --> 31:11.160
Today, a party for the elderly

31:11.244 --> 31:15.164
is taking place at the town hall.

31:15.248 --> 31:18.167
<i>We're gathering to wish
our elders good health.</i>

31:18.251 --> 31:21.921
<i>Meat and rice cakes
will be served as part of the feast,</i>

31:22.005 --> 31:26.009
<i>so please attend the party
if you haven't already</i>

31:26.092 --> 31:29.220
<i>and make sure to get there
as soon as you can.</i>

31:30.597 --> 31:34.559
Just so you know, I would've won
the number one song on <i>Top Ten Songs</i>

31:34.642 --> 31:38.438
if I hadn't gone up against
Seo Taiji and Boys in 1993.

31:38.521 --> 31:41.232
Do you know the song "Hayeoga"?

31:41.316 --> 31:42.775
-<i>To you, I'm--</i>
-That song I know.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.652
See? Everyone knows "Hayeoga."

31:44.736 --> 31:46.446
Do you know what Korea's number two

31:46.529 --> 31:47.989
-national treasure is?
-No.

31:48.072 --> 31:50.366
The ten-story Stone Pagoda
at Wongaksa Temple Site.

31:50.450 --> 31:53.036
We all know what
the number one treasure is,

31:53.119 --> 31:54.203
but not number two.

31:54.287 --> 31:56.623
It's the same with you.
You know "Hayeoga,"

31:56.706 --> 31:58.750
but not "Exercising in the Moonlight."

31:58.833 --> 32:01.169
No one ever remembers second place.

32:01.252 --> 32:03.379
Why am I so worked up about this?

32:04.339 --> 32:05.673
It's not you I'm blaming.

32:06.507 --> 32:10.053
Anyway, my second album
was well on its way.

32:10.136 --> 32:11.596
I poured my soul into it.

32:11.679 --> 32:13.848
I even recorded the title song,

32:13.932 --> 32:16.976
but my manager ran off
with all of the production funds.

32:17.060 --> 32:21.147
And while I looked for him
everywhere throughout the country,

32:21.230 --> 32:23.524
people forgot about me.

32:23.608 --> 32:26.903
Since then, all I could do
was sing at nightclubs,

32:26.986 --> 32:29.614
and I ended up settling here in Gongjin.

32:31.199 --> 32:34.202
-I met a woman, you see.
-I need to use the restroom.

32:34.285 --> 32:35.495
Yes, sure thing.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.039
I see you go to the restroom often.

32:39.499 --> 32:42.710
Ms. Dentist, why don't you come
have a bowl of <i>yukgaejang</i> too?

32:42.794 --> 32:45.755
-I'm good.
-Why not? Still on a diet?

32:45.838 --> 32:48.049
That's not it.
I just don't have an appetite.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.634
But it smells incredible.

32:52.095 --> 32:54.514
Are you aware of how much dust is here?

32:54.597 --> 32:56.224
And there are so many people here.

32:56.307 --> 33:00.144
Food cooked out here in the open
is just unsanitary.

33:00.228 --> 33:03.564
Hold on a second.
Are you calling this soup dirty?

33:03.648 --> 33:04.816
I'm just saying.

33:04.899 --> 33:07.360
Spoken like a fussy Seoulite.

33:07.443 --> 33:09.404
Must you be so picky?

33:09.487 --> 33:12.824
Why can't you look the other way
and only see the good things?

33:12.907 --> 33:14.117
What for?

33:15.076 --> 33:16.828
Because you just moved here and--

33:18.246 --> 33:20.581
Hey, Mi-seon. Where are you?

33:22.917 --> 33:24.794
<i>I'm out grocery shopping.</i>

33:24.877 --> 33:28.840
My boyfriend's been busy at work,
so we haven't been able to get together.

33:28.923 --> 33:30.258
I thought I'd cook for him.

33:30.341 --> 33:32.135
Devoted, aren't you?

33:35.430 --> 33:37.557
What's with the commotion?

33:37.640 --> 33:41.227
This is Oh Yoon speaking. It's not
a true party without a song from me!

33:41.310 --> 33:43.813
Geum-cheol, let's do this!

33:43.896 --> 33:44.856
All right!

33:45.523 --> 33:47.483
-Just a second.
-<i>When spring comes</i>

33:47.567 --> 33:50.820
<i>You said you'd come to me</i>

33:51.487 --> 33:55.575
<i>Like a singing swallow</i>

33:55.658 --> 33:56.826
Geum-cheol!

33:58.661 --> 34:01.581
A party for the elderly?
You really went there?

34:01.664 --> 34:04.250
I was hoping I could
promote my new clinic,

34:04.333 --> 34:05.710
but I shouldn't have come.

34:05.793 --> 34:08.004
<i>Why's that? It's not for you, is it?</i>

34:08.087 --> 34:09.589
You have no idea.

34:10.423 --> 34:12.467
In a yard where dirt is kicked up,

34:12.550 --> 34:14.635
they grill meat, boil soup, and sing.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.889
On top of that, the old ladies
use their bare hands when eating.

34:17.972 --> 34:21.434
Gosh, it's like they're doing
everything you hate.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.603
Exactly.

34:24.854 --> 34:26.689
<i>Looking up at the blue sky</i>

34:26.773 --> 34:27.690
I'm reminded of you!

34:27.774 --> 34:29.817
<i>I'm reminded of you</i>

34:30.401 --> 34:31.444
Geum-cheol!

34:31.527 --> 34:33.446
<i>Just like a swallow</i>

34:34.614 --> 34:35.948
<i>My heart flies to you</i>

34:36.032 --> 34:39.577
This is so annoying.
I shouldn't have come.

34:41.204 --> 34:42.288
CANCEL

34:43.706 --> 34:44.665
Hey, what the hell?

34:44.749 --> 34:46.000
-What?
-Darn it.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.628
-Hey, who did that?
-It was getting good.

34:48.711 --> 34:49.837
What's going on?

34:51.255 --> 34:54.509
<i>I don't like anything here.
Maybe I should've just stayed in Seoul.</i>

34:54.592 --> 34:55.468
-What?
-What?

34:55.551 --> 34:59.472
<i>There's this cafe owner here
who's apparently</i>

34:59.555 --> 35:01.140
<i>an obscure singer.</i>

35:01.641 --> 35:03.017
<i>Do you know Oh Yoon?</i>

35:05.937 --> 35:07.480
You don't know, right?

35:07.563 --> 35:11.776
He keeps on talking about himself
when I didn't even ask.

35:11.859 --> 35:16.030
<i>His second album was scrapped
after his manager took off with the money.</i>

35:17.406 --> 35:18.741
<i>Isn't that an excuse though?</i>

35:19.325 --> 35:23.538
<i>If he had the willpower or talent,
he would've made it one way or another.</i>

35:25.706 --> 35:27.542
-<i>I…</i>
-Don't. It's all right.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.001
-<i>Living in the past</i>
-I'm good.

35:29.085 --> 35:30.711
<i>when one's present is in shambles?</i>

35:30.795 --> 35:32.547
<i>That's only what cowards do.</i>

35:33.548 --> 35:35.883
-<i>I feel bad though.</i>
-About what?

35:36.384 --> 35:39.428
I feel bad for those
whose hopes are left behind in the past.

35:40.179 --> 35:43.850
One's unfulfilled dreams
tend to hold a place in the heart.

35:46.102 --> 35:50.022
<i>Anyway, I'm nearly at the cashier now.</i>

35:50.106 --> 35:51.774
Right, bye.

36:21.637 --> 36:24.807
Unbelievable.
How could you have left the mike on?

36:24.891 --> 36:25.725
Turn it off!

36:25.808 --> 36:27.101
What?

36:27.185 --> 36:28.186
Oh, gosh.

36:31.898 --> 36:33.691
Chun-jae.

36:33.774 --> 36:35.568
-Chun-jae!
-Chun-jae!

37:13.689 --> 37:16.150
Here you are. I looked everywhere for you.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.153
Why did you have to… Damn it.

37:19.862 --> 37:22.782
You should take more photos.
Why are you here?

37:22.865 --> 37:24.450
I took enough.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.789
Chun-jae, are you all right?

37:32.333 --> 37:36.212
Don't take what she said to heart.
Consider it as ignorant babbling.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.299
All she said is right though.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.552
My life is worthy of such an assessment.

37:44.136 --> 37:45.763
What are you talking about?

37:45.846 --> 37:47.765
Regulars come by to hear your song,

37:47.848 --> 37:50.059
and you have a daughter you love so much.

37:54.605 --> 37:58.317
You know what?
Let's go someplace nice for a drink

37:59.026 --> 38:00.569
and lighten our mood.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.655
I need to make lunch for Ju-ri.

38:03.239 --> 38:06.242
She didn't want to eat at the party today,

38:06.325 --> 38:07.910
which I scolded her for.

38:10.496 --> 38:12.039
Good thing she didn't come.

38:14.625 --> 38:15.626
I'm off.

38:27.179 --> 38:28.097
DENTAL HYGIENIST WANTED

38:28.180 --> 38:30.308
NEW DENTAL CLINIC IN GONGJIN
LOOKING FOR LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE

38:35.771 --> 38:37.356
Me and my big mouth.

38:38.983 --> 38:41.444
To hell with my business.
I should pack up.

38:53.122 --> 38:55.791
Delivery. Are you Yoon Hye-jin?

38:55.875 --> 38:56.959
I am.

38:57.543 --> 38:58.794
Can you sign here?

38:58.878 --> 39:02.089
I didn't expect it to get here so soon
since it's an overseas delivery.

39:03.424 --> 39:04.967
That's how it usually is,

39:05.718 --> 39:07.011
but this one's early.

39:07.094 --> 39:08.804
You really do everything around here.

39:12.099 --> 39:14.560
What? Why are you staring at me like that?

39:15.144 --> 39:18.147
-You think you're better than everyone.
-What?

39:18.230 --> 39:21.067
Being smart, you got good grades
and became a dentist.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.194
Your life must've been smooth.

39:23.736 --> 39:27.281
Not always, of course,
but all you hit were simple speed bumps.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.408
Getting over those small bumps,

39:29.492 --> 39:32.078
you thought that willpower
could get you anywhere.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.288
If this is about earlier, stop.

39:34.955 --> 39:36.874
I shouldn't have to hear this from you.

39:36.957 --> 39:39.835
Why not? You freely judge
other people's lives,

39:39.919 --> 39:41.921
but are offended
when you're being assessed?

39:43.506 --> 39:46.425
Look here, doctor.
It seems like you're mistaken.

39:47.343 --> 39:50.346
Life isn't so fair for all of us.

39:51.472 --> 39:54.266
Some spend their whole lives
on unpaved roads,

39:54.850 --> 39:58.687
while some run at full speed
only to reach the edge of a cliff.

39:59.438 --> 40:00.564
Got that?

40:16.997 --> 40:18.833
What now? Do you have more to say?

40:23.254 --> 40:24.088
Mi-seon?

40:28.175 --> 40:29.844
I took a cab here.

40:30.386 --> 40:31.762
It cost me 200,000 won.

40:32.721 --> 40:33.806
What's going on?

40:41.647 --> 40:42.815
Let's head inside.

40:42.898 --> 40:44.525
Damn bastard.

40:48.237 --> 40:50.322
So you went to his place with groceries,

40:50.406 --> 40:53.242
and a woman with a two to eight parting

40:53.868 --> 40:55.703
was there in his dress shirt?

40:56.370 --> 40:57.204
Yes.

40:58.038 --> 41:00.791
Apparently, she came after landing.
She's a flight attendant.

41:00.875 --> 41:01.709
And?

41:03.169 --> 41:06.088
Both she and I had no idea.

41:06.172 --> 41:08.757
-That's when the bastard crawled in.
-And?

41:08.841 --> 41:11.385
We both took out items
from the grocery bag.

41:11.469 --> 41:14.263
I wielded spring onions
while she swung the net of onions.

41:15.806 --> 41:17.516
Wasn't there anything sharp?

41:17.600 --> 41:20.644
The spring onions were the sharpest item.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.191
You're a true friend
who'd let me ruin my life completely.

41:26.775 --> 41:28.569
Come on. We're going back to Seoul.

41:28.652 --> 41:29.904
Sit back down.

41:29.987 --> 41:31.906
Why? We should go and kill that bastard.

41:34.450 --> 41:35.826
Or did you already?

41:36.535 --> 41:39.288
Enough with the crap
and take down that classified ad.

41:44.919 --> 41:47.671
Board and lodging
and a ten percent raise. Okay?

41:51.050 --> 41:52.134
Deal?

41:52.843 --> 41:53.677
Deal.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.680
Come here!

42:01.185 --> 42:02.311
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

42:02.394 --> 42:03.562
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

42:10.402 --> 42:12.530
It's finally D-day.

42:12.613 --> 42:14.365
Let's get off to a good start.

42:32.466 --> 42:34.385
YOON DENTAL CLINIC OPENING EVENT

42:51.986 --> 42:54.905
I guess word didn't spread properly.

42:54.989 --> 42:59.410
What if I promote the clinic online?
I have 50,000 followers on social media.

43:00.369 --> 43:01.704
BORA SUPERMARKET

43:01.787 --> 43:03.872
-Hello.
-Hello.

43:11.630 --> 43:12.756
-Hello.
-Hello.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.925
Yun-gyeong, I'd like to buy some shampoo.

43:15.467 --> 43:17.094
The one with the nice scent.

43:18.887 --> 43:19.888
Unbelievable.

43:19.972 --> 43:21.140
What's going on?

43:26.020 --> 43:28.647
Hey, did you do something wrong?

43:46.040 --> 43:47.082
What is it?

43:47.583 --> 43:48.834
What?

43:54.340 --> 43:55.424
What's wrong?

43:57.509 --> 43:58.802
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

43:58.886 --> 44:00.387
Why do you keep glancing at her?

44:00.471 --> 44:03.932
It's nothing. The anchovies
are on the smaller side today.

44:04.016 --> 44:07.436
Well, they're supposed to be small.

44:07.519 --> 44:09.104
-Right.
-They look delicious.

44:10.564 --> 44:11.982
Goodness.

44:13.025 --> 44:13.942
Gosh!

44:14.652 --> 44:17.404
Seriously? And you're telling me this now?

44:17.488 --> 44:20.658
If I had told you sooner,
you wouldn't have moved here.

44:20.741 --> 44:23.410
You're not a friend, but a scam artist.

44:25.579 --> 44:29.500
What am I going to do?
The rumors must've spread.

44:33.003 --> 44:34.421
Forget it.

44:34.505 --> 44:37.549
Private clinics can't stay afloat
without the town's trust.

44:37.633 --> 44:40.219
Let's pack it up and head back to Seoul.

44:40.302 --> 44:41.887
How can I

44:42.930 --> 44:44.264
when I spent a fortune here?

44:44.348 --> 44:46.892
Don't think of it like that.
Cut your losses now,

44:46.975 --> 44:50.979
or you'll spend months being in the red.

44:51.605 --> 44:52.731
Like my dad.

44:56.402 --> 44:57.403
Hey!

44:58.237 --> 44:59.321
Where are you going?

45:00.072 --> 45:01.198
Where is she going?

45:31.353 --> 45:32.896
Out for some moonlight jogging?

45:37.401 --> 45:40.112
You must be angry
about what I said that day.

45:42.072 --> 45:43.073
By the way,

45:44.241 --> 45:46.952
how about you run
in a different outfit next time?

45:49.413 --> 45:51.415
-What?
-Rumor has it

45:51.498 --> 45:53.667
that the dentist
runs around in her long johns.

45:55.586 --> 45:56.753
These are leggings.

45:56.837 --> 46:00.048
Whether I wear long johns or a bikini
is none of their business.

46:00.132 --> 46:04.011
Yes, you're right. But I'd appreciate
you meeting them halfway.

46:05.095 --> 46:07.347
I see you've yet
to catch up with the world.

46:07.431 --> 46:09.308
Meddling can be dangerous, you know.

46:09.391 --> 46:13.520
I know that it's for a better workout
and not for other people to see.

46:13.604 --> 46:15.397
-But?
-This may sound old-fashioned,

46:15.481 --> 46:18.734
but this isn't Seoul.
The town has an older population.

46:18.817 --> 46:20.068
It sure is exhausting.

46:20.152 --> 46:23.447
Yet, you're the one
who chose to open a dental clinic here.

46:24.072 --> 46:26.283
Don't we all need some time to adjust?

46:27.618 --> 46:31.538
I've thought about it,
and all people make mistakes.

46:32.206 --> 46:35.501
Technically speaking, you didn't know
that the mic was turned on.

46:36.001 --> 46:38.462
We all badmouth others
at least once in our lives.

46:38.545 --> 46:39.922
It'll be fine, so don't worry.

46:40.589 --> 46:44.676
Everyone in this town is probably busy
talking smack about you too.

46:46.011 --> 46:49.723
Now that things are even,
you can move forward from here.

46:50.807 --> 46:52.434
Did you hand out rice cakes?

46:55.395 --> 46:56.813
Unbelievable.

47:08.534 --> 47:10.369
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

47:10.452 --> 47:11.453
Ms. Yeo.

47:13.330 --> 47:16.333
Hello. This is to celebrate
the opening of my clinic.

47:17.084 --> 47:19.545
Right. I see you bought rice cakes.

47:19.628 --> 47:21.755
-Please have it while it's warm.
-Thank you.

47:24.007 --> 47:27.344
Hello, I'm here from Yoon Dental Clinic.

47:27.427 --> 47:28.762
Please have some rice cakes.

47:31.014 --> 47:32.057
You can leave it here.

47:37.104 --> 47:38.188
Have a good day.

47:39.064 --> 47:40.607
Darn it. Why isn't this working?

47:40.691 --> 47:42.067
BORA SUPERMARKET

47:42.150 --> 47:43.235
Hello.

47:44.152 --> 47:45.112
Have some rice cake.

47:45.195 --> 47:48.073
I'm being tested for
gestational diabetes tomorrow.

47:48.156 --> 47:49.533
I see you can't have any.

47:51.577 --> 47:52.578
Sorry about that.

47:52.661 --> 47:53.996
I'm sorry.

47:56.832 --> 47:58.208
Hello.

47:58.917 --> 48:01.712
Yoon Dental Clinic just opened.
I hope we get along.

48:11.430 --> 48:14.600
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

48:31.366 --> 48:32.826
Hey, it's the dentist!

48:34.077 --> 48:35.746
-Hello.
-Hello.

48:35.829 --> 48:37.289
Hi, kids.

48:37.873 --> 48:38.749
What are you up to?

48:43.211 --> 48:44.212
What's this?

48:45.547 --> 48:46.840
Is it a hedgehog?

48:46.923 --> 48:48.091
Yes.

48:48.175 --> 48:49.134
No way.

48:54.306 --> 48:57.059
You want me to take care of it?

48:57.976 --> 49:01.229
Yes, we saved up our allowance to buy it,

49:01.897 --> 49:04.107
but my mom won't let me keep it.

49:04.191 --> 49:05.734
GONGJIN MARKET

49:05.817 --> 49:07.694
You can take it instead then.

49:08.362 --> 49:09.905
I was going to,

49:10.447 --> 49:12.532
but I haven't been able
to tell my mom yet.

49:12.616 --> 49:16.119
He'll ask her once he wins a prize
at the math competition.

49:16.203 --> 49:17.329
Is that so?

49:17.954 --> 49:20.916
That'll be really hard.
Are you sure you can do it?

49:20.999 --> 49:23.043
He's super smart!

49:23.126 --> 49:25.087
He gets a perfect score all the time.

49:25.170 --> 49:26.838
Really?

49:31.343 --> 49:33.845
Still, I'm afraid I can't take this.

49:35.430 --> 49:39.226
Hey, why don't you ask
Chief Hong to look after it?

49:39.309 --> 49:41.395
We already asked,

49:42.312 --> 49:43.689
and he declined.

49:43.772 --> 49:44.856
Why?

49:48.110 --> 49:51.905
He acts all high and mighty
but declines a child's request?

49:53.407 --> 49:57.244
I'm sorry to say this,
but I can't look after it either.

49:57.994 --> 49:59.871
Pets aren't really my thing,

50:00.539 --> 50:02.541
and providing for myself is tough enough.

50:02.624 --> 50:06.336
Look for someone else to help, okay?
Again, I'm sorry.

50:07.295 --> 50:08.630
Enjoy your rice cake.

50:11.717 --> 50:14.636
See? I told you she wouldn't do it for us.

50:15.178 --> 50:20.308
My mom said that
she's such a cold-hearted person.

50:29.109 --> 50:33.363
Money sure is great.
You always get what you pay for.

50:33.864 --> 50:35.407
How was the facial?

50:35.490 --> 50:36.408
Gosh.

50:37.993 --> 50:40.454
What's this? Is that a hedgehog?

50:40.537 --> 50:42.247
Where did you get it?

50:42.330 --> 50:45.333
Someone asked me
to take care of it for a few days.

50:45.834 --> 50:48.086
Who in this town would ask you?

50:48.170 --> 50:52.382
Well, my first patient in Gongjin did.

50:52.466 --> 50:55.594
What do you mean?
We still have zero patients.

50:57.679 --> 50:58.680
Hey.

50:59.389 --> 51:00.974
What's with all this mail?

51:01.933 --> 51:04.811
How many charity organizations
do you support?

51:04.895 --> 51:07.105
Jeez. It's not that many.

51:07.189 --> 51:08.774
Not that many, my foot.

51:09.441 --> 51:11.276
Single mothers, low-income households,

51:11.359 --> 51:13.236
and schools in Africa.

51:13.320 --> 51:16.031
Shouldn't you be
tightening your belt instead?

51:16.114 --> 51:18.533
Until we get patients,
cut back on monthly donations.

51:18.617 --> 51:20.243
Look at it run.

51:21.119 --> 51:22.370
Just look at it go.

51:23.371 --> 51:25.540
-There you go.
-Unbelievable.

51:25.624 --> 51:28.168
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

51:28.251 --> 51:31.213
REGULAR PERFORMANCE CANCELED

51:32.214 --> 51:34.466
Chun-jae, has today's performance
been canceled?

51:35.050 --> 51:37.302
Yes, I'm not feeling all that good.

51:37.385 --> 51:38.553
What, how bad is it?

51:38.637 --> 51:41.389
What? My head is a bit…

51:42.599 --> 51:46.978
Customers never seem
to finish their coffee. What a waste.

51:47.062 --> 51:49.439
-That's because it's no good.
-What?

51:49.523 --> 51:52.025
Your coffee tastes awful.
Uncle Du-sik's is good though.

51:52.108 --> 51:53.944
-It's really bad.
-Ju-ri, stop.

51:54.027 --> 51:55.362
-What? It's true.
-Right?

51:56.780 --> 51:58.114
I don't do anything right.

52:03.995 --> 52:06.623
Ju-ri, I know you've hit puberty
and want to rebel

52:06.706 --> 52:08.333
-every three seconds.
-Puberty?

52:08.416 --> 52:11.419
But don't be so mean to your father.
You'll regret it later.

52:11.503 --> 52:13.213
-You smell like a geezer.
-What?

52:13.296 --> 52:14.589
-You stink.
-I don't.

52:14.673 --> 52:15.757
You do.

52:15.841 --> 52:19.761
I only say this
because I'm the slightest bit wiser.

52:19.845 --> 52:23.682
-And I sound like an adult, not a geezer.
-"Adult."

52:23.765 --> 52:27.435
-Don't be crooked like your eyebrows.
-Wait. Do my eyebrows look weird?

52:27.519 --> 52:28.645
That can't be.

52:29.521 --> 52:31.648
Gosh. They look perfectly fine!

52:31.731 --> 52:33.984
I sure did a good job on them.

52:40.490 --> 52:41.366
Jeez.

52:56.047 --> 52:57.507
<i>THE END AND THE BEGINNING</i>
OH YOON

52:57.591 --> 52:59.718
DEMO OF <i>THE END AND THE BEGINNING</i>,
OH YOON'S 2ND ALBUM

53:09.269 --> 53:11.730
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

53:11.813 --> 53:15.066
WEEKDAYS 9:00 TO 18:00
SATURDAYS 9:00 TO 12:00

53:15.150 --> 53:17.110
I hope we get patients today.

53:17.193 --> 53:20.196
We will. You handed out
the rice cakes, remember?

53:20.280 --> 53:21.197
The rice cakes?

53:28.622 --> 53:29.456
Welcome.

53:29.539 --> 53:30.874
Good day.

53:30.957 --> 53:32.042
What the hell?

53:36.254 --> 53:37.589
You still don't get it.

53:37.672 --> 53:39.132
Why are you on my case again?

53:39.215 --> 53:41.509
Because you're pathetic.
Do you really think

53:41.593 --> 53:43.595
that giving out rice cakes was enough?

53:43.678 --> 53:45.055
I followed your advice.

53:46.264 --> 53:48.516
-It made no difference.
-Because it was insincere.

53:48.600 --> 53:52.062
Didn't you reluctantly show your face
and ask them to come by some time?

53:52.145 --> 53:53.438
I can almost see it.

53:53.521 --> 53:54.564
So what?

53:54.648 --> 53:56.483
-Come with me.
-Where?

53:56.566 --> 53:58.652
Would you rather let your business tank?

54:00.445 --> 54:03.198
Are you nuts? Why would you bring me here?

54:03.281 --> 54:06.785
Aren't you a resident too?
You should be at the neighborhood meeting.

54:06.868 --> 54:08.328
You know what I mean.

54:08.912 --> 54:10.747
-I can't go in there.
-Jeez.

54:11.498 --> 54:13.541
Will you just keep avoiding them then?

54:13.625 --> 54:15.418
If you can't pick up spilt milk,

54:15.502 --> 54:18.296
you should at least
apologize to them for spilling the milk,

54:18.380 --> 54:19.923
rather than avoid them.

54:21.299 --> 54:22.801
Go in already. I'm busy.

54:22.884 --> 54:24.094
Aren't you going in?

54:24.177 --> 54:26.054
No, I have other things to do.

54:26.137 --> 54:26.972
Wait.

54:27.597 --> 54:29.349
How can I possibly go in there alone?

54:29.432 --> 54:31.267
They're all strangers to me.

54:31.351 --> 54:32.769
Are you leaning on me?

54:34.270 --> 54:36.272
-Of course not.
-Then get in there already.

54:36.356 --> 54:39.359
Don't even think about running.
I'll hunt you down.

54:41.695 --> 54:42.737
Are you leaning on me?

54:42.821 --> 54:44.030
No.

54:55.041 --> 54:59.421
Did she really think that
giving out the rice cakes would do?

54:59.504 --> 55:01.089
I thought she was nice,

55:01.172 --> 55:03.550
but she thinks my supermarket
is a corner shop

55:03.633 --> 55:05.677
and calls Gongjin the countryside.

55:05.760 --> 55:09.723
She couldn't be more wrong.
This is an old town with a long history.

55:09.806 --> 55:12.058
It has history and is on the bigger side.

55:12.142 --> 55:14.728
Gongjin used to be home
to the Dragon King.

55:14.811 --> 55:17.063
But there she is running
while barely covered.

55:17.147 --> 55:19.024
It must've angered the Dragon King.

55:19.107 --> 55:20.108
Tell me about it.

55:20.191 --> 55:23.194
And how dare she
look down on us like that?

55:23.278 --> 55:24.946
It sure is upsetting.

55:26.197 --> 55:28.825
That's enough. Please drop it already.

55:28.908 --> 55:30.785
What do you mean we should drop it?

55:30.869 --> 55:32.954
Aren't you just as pissed off?

55:33.038 --> 55:36.082
When will you stop hitting people
while you talk?

55:36.166 --> 55:37.333
When did I do that?

55:37.417 --> 55:38.918
You did it just now.

55:39.002 --> 55:40.628
Sitting next to you hurts.

55:41.379 --> 55:44.382
Stop accusing me
of something I didn't do. My gosh.

55:44.466 --> 55:46.634
Chun-jae, you tell me. Did I do that?

55:46.718 --> 55:48.178
Goodness.

55:48.261 --> 55:52.015
Must you two get into it again?

55:52.682 --> 55:53.683
Gosh.

55:55.310 --> 55:56.936
Hello, everyone.

55:57.020 --> 55:57.979
-What?
-Huh?

55:58.063 --> 55:59.689
-Dr. Yoon!
-What?

55:59.773 --> 56:03.359
I never expected you
to attend the neighborhood meeting.

56:03.443 --> 56:04.694
Tell me about it.

56:04.778 --> 56:07.781
I'm sorry about the town hall
not meeting your high standards.

56:08.406 --> 56:09.616
Jeez.

56:10.575 --> 56:12.994
God, it's heavy. Move out of the way.

56:14.829 --> 56:17.332
-Gosh, this almost killed my back.
-What is it?

56:17.415 --> 56:19.793
-I'm a little late, aren't I?
-Yes.

56:20.418 --> 56:22.587
I went to bring today's snacks.

56:22.670 --> 56:24.047
-Snacks?
-Yes.

56:24.130 --> 56:26.716
It's all Dr. Yoon's treat.

56:26.800 --> 56:27.759
-What?
-What?

56:27.842 --> 56:28.843
She asked for my help.

56:28.927 --> 56:32.347
She was edgy because she just moved,
so she made a mistake.

56:32.430 --> 56:35.058
She wanted to apologize
and asked me to prepare some food.

56:39.479 --> 56:43.775
Yun-gyeong, I bought these
from your store earlier

56:43.858 --> 56:45.485
-and left a receipt.
-Really?

56:45.568 --> 56:46.736
Of course.

56:46.820 --> 56:49.447
Please take your pick then!

56:49.531 --> 56:53.701
We have <i>yugwa</i> and <i>gangjeong</i>,
as well as fruits and beverages.

56:54.285 --> 56:55.662
For those with bad teeth,

56:57.330 --> 56:59.290
there are white and yellow peaches.

56:59.374 --> 57:01.084
-Goodness.
-Yellow peaches?

57:02.293 --> 57:04.379
-Don't just sit there. Help me.
-Of course.

57:04.462 --> 57:05.880
-Geum-cheol.
-Yes?

57:05.964 --> 57:07.298
Me? Okay.

57:07.382 --> 57:08.758
Take this.

57:08.842 --> 57:10.844
-Take the box.
-Here you go.

57:10.927 --> 57:13.263
-It's fine. You can take a seat.
-Goodness.

57:13.346 --> 57:15.390
-Here.
-My gosh.

57:15.974 --> 57:19.519
Here. Take the beverages.

57:19.602 --> 57:21.229
And this.

57:21.312 --> 57:23.398
-Also…
-She bought a lot.

57:25.191 --> 57:27.777
<i>So that'll be the end of today's meeting.</i>

57:27.861 --> 57:30.822
I hope you didn't forget about
the weekly cleaning this Saturday.

57:30.905 --> 57:31.781
-No.
-Of course not.

57:31.865 --> 57:33.616
Please bring your cleaning tools

57:33.700 --> 57:37.620
and gather at the recycling site
at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

57:37.704 --> 57:39.497
-Right.
-Got it.

57:39.581 --> 57:40.999
Before we wrap up,

57:41.082 --> 57:46.379
let's give it up for Dr. Yoon who
provided the snacks for today's meeting.

57:46.463 --> 57:47.630
Right.

57:47.714 --> 57:49.257
It was nice.

57:50.049 --> 57:52.010
We enjoyed it.

57:52.093 --> 57:53.386
Everything was good.

57:59.684 --> 58:00.727
I enjoyed those snacks.

58:00.810 --> 58:02.187
-Bye.
-Good night.

58:02.270 --> 58:03.730
Good job for today.

58:03.813 --> 58:05.773
You too, Ms. Gam-ri.

58:05.857 --> 58:07.650
-Get some rest then.
-Good night.

58:07.734 --> 58:08.693
-Bye!
-Good night!

58:08.776 --> 58:11.321
-Thanks for today.
-Chun-jae, get home safely.

58:11.404 --> 58:12.489
-Good night.
-You too.

58:17.785 --> 58:20.455
Thank you for today.

58:21.664 --> 58:24.000
I didn't expect you to care so much.

58:29.506 --> 58:31.299
-Give me your hand.
-What?

58:31.382 --> 58:33.051
Show me your hand.

58:33.134 --> 58:34.052
My hand?

58:57.325 --> 58:59.160
-What's this?
-Take a look.

59:04.791 --> 59:05.959
A total of 125,000 won?

59:06.042 --> 59:08.795
Before I knew it, I bought that much.

59:09.796 --> 59:11.714
You know where to wire the money, right?

59:13.633 --> 59:15.677
So does this mean

59:16.636 --> 59:20.139
you bought the snacks to help me,

59:21.140 --> 59:23.059
-but I have to pay?
-Of course.

59:23.142 --> 59:25.937
You're obviously richer,
so why should I pay?

59:26.020 --> 59:27.605
-You're telling me now?
-Why not?

59:28.523 --> 59:30.191
I didn't ask you to do this.

59:30.275 --> 59:32.485
You didn't even ask for my consent.

59:32.569 --> 59:34.571
You should work on how to say thanks.

59:34.654 --> 59:38.283
Neighborhood meeting or whatnot,
don't invite me to events like this again.

59:39.242 --> 59:40.451
I won't let it slide.

59:40.535 --> 59:42.412
Wire it by the end of the day. Bye.

59:42.495 --> 59:43.830
I warned you.

59:43.913 --> 59:45.081
Duly noted.

59:48.918 --> 59:50.253
What the hell?

59:51.546 --> 59:52.880
I'm not grateful anymore.

59:56.676 --> 59:58.052
Hurry, guys.

59:58.136 --> 1:00:00.388
-Hurry over!
-Morning!

1:00:00.471 --> 1:00:03.266
-Morning.
-Hurry up. Just look at the time!

1:00:03.349 --> 1:00:05.184
-There they come.
-Hello.

1:00:05.268 --> 1:00:07.145
Honey, I told you to stay home.

1:00:07.228 --> 1:00:09.230
-Let's get this over with.
-Hello.

1:00:09.314 --> 1:00:11.691
Let's split into teams

1:00:11.774 --> 1:00:15.612
and pick up the trash thoroughly.
We'll all contribute, okay?

1:00:15.695 --> 1:00:18.531
Thank you, everyone.
Let's get started then.

1:00:27.665 --> 1:00:30.501
Goodness. I see you just got up.

1:00:30.585 --> 1:00:32.670
Right. What is this about?

1:00:32.754 --> 1:00:35.882
At the neighborhood meeting,
I mentioned the weekly cleaning.

1:00:35.965 --> 1:00:40.219
Everyone else showed up, but you didn't
until well over 9:00 a.m., so I came.

1:00:40.303 --> 1:00:41.638
Right.

1:00:43.139 --> 1:00:45.642
Could I perhaps skip it this once?

1:00:45.725 --> 1:00:48.019
As you know, I just moved here.

1:00:48.102 --> 1:00:49.812
I'll participate starting next week.

1:00:50.396 --> 1:00:51.314
Sure thing.

1:00:51.397 --> 1:00:52.732
All right, then.

1:00:59.530 --> 1:01:00.740
That's understandable.

1:01:04.702 --> 1:01:07.455
Ms. Dentist, get out here.

1:01:08.956 --> 1:01:11.000
Get out here, Ms. Dentist!

1:01:11.084 --> 1:01:12.251
He's so annoying.

1:01:14.295 --> 1:01:16.047
I know you're in there.

1:01:16.130 --> 1:01:17.840
I won't leave until you come out.

1:01:20.551 --> 1:01:21.552
Get out here!

1:01:22.470 --> 1:01:23.471
Ms. Dentist!

1:01:24.263 --> 1:01:26.015
Jeez.

1:01:26.099 --> 1:01:29.644
Out. Get out.

1:01:30.311 --> 1:01:33.189
Go, see what he wants!

1:01:49.747 --> 1:01:50.998
Chief Hong,

1:01:51.791 --> 1:01:54.252
I feel a little under the weather.

1:01:54.752 --> 1:01:57.130
Opening the clinic
must've taken a toll on me.

1:01:57.213 --> 1:01:58.047
What?

1:02:03.386 --> 1:02:04.470
I have a fever too.

1:02:04.554 --> 1:02:07.598
Is that so? That's too bad.

1:02:08.307 --> 1:02:10.059
Let me see. Hold on.

1:02:11.018 --> 1:02:12.019
Found it.

1:02:12.103 --> 1:02:13.980
Here it is.

1:02:15.231 --> 1:02:16.232
Here.

1:02:19.694 --> 1:02:21.237
That's 36.3°C.

1:02:22.238 --> 1:02:23.740
You're 0.2°C below average.

1:02:23.823 --> 1:02:24.991
Well…

1:02:26.075 --> 1:02:27.243
Maybe I run colder.

1:02:27.326 --> 1:02:28.661
Get out here now!

1:02:29.704 --> 1:02:31.914
Just leave me alone!

1:02:32.707 --> 1:02:34.542
I need my sleep.

1:02:52.310 --> 1:02:53.394
Chun-jae.

1:02:53.478 --> 1:02:55.021
Help the ladies over there.

1:02:57.106 --> 1:02:57.940
Won't you sweep?

1:02:58.024 --> 1:03:00.651
Can't you see that I am?
I'm not the only one out here.

1:03:13.164 --> 1:03:15.333
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

1:03:34.936 --> 1:03:37.480
The clinic is open, right?

1:03:38.272 --> 1:03:40.942
Right, of course. Ms. Pyo?

1:03:41.025 --> 1:03:42.652
-It's your first time, right?
-Yes.

1:03:42.735 --> 1:03:44.737
-Please fill out this form first.
-Sure.

1:03:44.821 --> 1:03:46.072
-Right here.
-Got it.

1:03:56.499 --> 1:03:57.667
-Here.
-Thank you.

1:03:58.835 --> 1:04:01.587
Mr. Choi Eun-cheol, shall we?

1:04:01.671 --> 1:04:02.713
Okay.

1:04:07.635 --> 1:04:08.636
Hello.

1:04:09.804 --> 1:04:10.721
Hello.

1:04:10.805 --> 1:04:12.974
Hello. It's your first time, right?

1:04:15.184 --> 1:04:17.812
<i>I went there because you recommended it,
and it was nice.</i>

1:04:19.021 --> 1:04:19.981
Really?

1:04:20.064 --> 1:04:22.942
<i>The treatment didn't hurt
which shows her competence,</i>

1:04:23.025 --> 1:04:24.652
<i>and the cost was reasonable.</i>

1:04:25.945 --> 1:04:26.946
I'm glad.

1:04:27.613 --> 1:04:28.906
Anyway, thanks.

1:04:28.990 --> 1:04:30.199
See you.

1:04:31.993 --> 1:04:33.244
-No customers?
-You're here.

1:04:33.327 --> 1:04:35.121
I'm sorry I had to step out.

1:04:35.204 --> 1:04:37.456
Don't be. I'm paid to watch the cafe.

1:04:37.540 --> 1:04:40.793
One might think I actually pay you a lot.

1:04:40.877 --> 1:04:42.879
Why you won't accept a raise is beyond me.

1:04:42.962 --> 1:04:44.422
I like things the way they are.

1:04:44.505 --> 1:04:46.048
Aren't you going fishing today?

1:04:46.549 --> 1:04:47.675
I'm here, so get going.

1:04:47.758 --> 1:04:48.968
After I'm done with this.

1:04:49.051 --> 1:04:51.637
By the way,
I uploaded a file on your computer.

1:04:52.179 --> 1:04:54.098
A file? What kind of file?

1:04:55.391 --> 1:04:57.727
Your second title song,
"The End and the Beginning."

1:04:59.103 --> 1:05:01.022
2ND ALBUM <i>THE END AND THE BEGINNING</i>

1:05:01.105 --> 1:05:03.190
I didn't think it belonged in the trash.

1:05:06.193 --> 1:05:07.403
Times have changed.

1:05:07.486 --> 1:05:10.948
It's been digitized, so you
don't need to listen to it on a tape.

1:05:13.451 --> 1:05:15.995
How nice of you to care so much about me.

1:05:17.455 --> 1:05:18.706
Thanks, Du-sik.

1:05:21.918 --> 1:05:23.210
I'm good though.

1:05:24.086 --> 1:05:24.921
What?

1:05:25.588 --> 1:05:28.507
I'm done reminiscing my past.

1:05:28.591 --> 1:05:32.053
I can't make it big
as a singer anymore at this age,

1:05:32.136 --> 1:05:34.180
so I should focus on the present.

1:05:34.263 --> 1:05:37.767
I'm going to put my head on straight
and improve the cafe instead.

1:05:37.850 --> 1:05:41.646
I need to put Ju-ri through fashion school
so that she can become a designer.

1:05:47.443 --> 1:05:50.655
-Chun-jae.
-So can you teach me how to make coffee?

1:05:50.738 --> 1:05:54.784
How can I run a cafe when I can't
even make a decent cup of it?

1:05:54.867 --> 1:05:56.243
I guess that was bad.

1:05:56.327 --> 1:05:57.203
I'm in.

1:05:57.954 --> 1:05:59.330
I won't go easy on you.

1:05:59.413 --> 1:06:00.539
-Got it.
-Right.

1:06:00.623 --> 1:06:02.458
-Get over here then.
-Right now?

1:06:02.541 --> 1:06:05.169
Of course. I said I wouldn't
go easy on you.

1:06:05.920 --> 1:06:07.213
-Gosh.
-Darn.

1:06:07.296 --> 1:06:09.131
Even I don't drink the coffee I make.

1:06:10.925 --> 1:06:13.427
Thank you. Please have a good day.

1:06:14.095 --> 1:06:15.429
Ms. Park In-sun?

1:06:16.597 --> 1:06:17.765
Hello, sir.

1:06:17.848 --> 1:06:19.600
Is this your first time here?

1:06:27.024 --> 1:06:28.859
You're almost done.

1:06:30.861 --> 1:06:32.530
Suction, please.

1:06:32.613 --> 1:06:33.531
Okay.

1:06:42.039 --> 1:06:45.001
<i>WALDEN</i> BY HENRY DAVID THOREAU

1:06:47.837 --> 1:06:51.674
WHAT I DESIRE ARE
THE FLOWERS AND FRUIT OF PEOPLE

1:06:59.348 --> 1:07:03.728
Hye-jin, my gosh. What a day.
It was exhausting, wasn't it?

1:07:03.811 --> 1:07:07.356
No, I was so happy
that I didn't feel tired at all.

1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:09.984
This could be the beginning
of great success!

1:07:10.067 --> 1:07:12.862
Tell me about it.

1:07:12.945 --> 1:07:17.241
It's odd though.
How did we get so many all of a sudden?

1:07:17.324 --> 1:07:18.617
What?

1:07:18.701 --> 1:07:21.871
Our situation changed literally overnight.

1:07:23.414 --> 1:07:25.332
Did my social media pay off?

1:07:27.668 --> 1:07:32.214
Or maybe the bad rumors about you
have finally subsided.

1:07:37.344 --> 1:07:40.222
<i>Life isn't so fair for all of us.</i>

1:07:41.766 --> 1:07:44.602
<i>Some spend their whole lives
on unpaved roads,</i>

1:07:45.186 --> 1:07:48.981
<i>while some run at full speed
only to reach the edge of a cliff.</i>

1:07:51.942 --> 1:07:53.944
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

1:08:00.785 --> 1:08:01.786
I…

1:08:03.079 --> 1:08:05.372
listened to the album you gave me.

1:08:06.791 --> 1:08:07.792
Right.

1:08:07.875 --> 1:08:09.293
To be honest though,

1:08:09.794 --> 1:08:12.088
"Exercising in the Moonlight"
wasn't all that good.

1:08:13.756 --> 1:08:14.757
I see.

1:08:14.840 --> 1:08:16.217
But,

1:08:16.300 --> 1:08:19.011
I did enjoy "Blue Scar on the Heart".

1:08:21.347 --> 1:08:25.059
The melody was nice
and I could relate to the lyrics.

1:08:25.768 --> 1:08:26.852
I really liked it.

1:08:31.065 --> 1:08:32.525
Oh, I see.

1:08:33.192 --> 1:08:34.652
So that's more your style.

1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:39.657
I'm truly sorry about
what I said that day.

1:08:39.740 --> 1:08:44.578
That day? And what day would that be?

1:08:49.667 --> 1:08:52.336
Have you perhaps seen Chief Hong today?

1:08:52.419 --> 1:08:54.839
You mean Du-sik? Well,

1:08:54.922 --> 1:08:57.550
he went out to the mudflats.

1:08:57.633 --> 1:08:59.385
Would you be able to find it though?

1:08:59.468 --> 1:09:03.055
-From Gongjin Harbor--
-Yes, I know where it is.

1:09:03.139 --> 1:09:04.723
I see. It's where Turtle Rock is.

1:09:04.807 --> 1:09:07.184
Right. Well, enjoy your smoke.

1:09:07.268 --> 1:09:09.103
Actually, I'm trying to quit.

1:09:10.563 --> 1:09:12.731
-Thank you.
-Thanks to you too.

1:09:17.653 --> 1:09:20.698
I really should quit.
A singer shouldn't smoke.

1:09:33.460 --> 1:09:35.629
2ND ALBUM <i>THE END AND THE BEGINNING</i>

1:09:35.713 --> 1:09:38.549
3. "THE END AND THE BEGINNING"

1:10:38.609 --> 1:10:39.693
Chief Hong.

1:10:42.488 --> 1:10:43.697
Chief Hong!

1:10:47.409 --> 1:10:48.702
Fancy seeing you here.

1:10:50.371 --> 1:10:53.040
Well, I had something to say.

1:10:55.709 --> 1:10:56.835
Go ahead.

1:10:57.836 --> 1:11:01.006
The clinic had a surge of patients today,

1:11:01.090 --> 1:11:03.050
and I think I have you to thank.

1:11:03.926 --> 1:11:06.095
I thought about
what you said the other day too.

1:11:06.762 --> 1:11:09.431
I'm not saying you were right,

1:11:09.515 --> 1:11:12.685
-but you have a point--
-I can't hear a thing!

1:11:12.768 --> 1:11:14.019
Can you come up here?

1:11:15.229 --> 1:11:16.563
I don't think I can.

1:11:19.191 --> 1:11:21.068
Your shoes always cause trouble.

1:11:29.368 --> 1:11:30.536
Here.

1:11:32.788 --> 1:11:33.789
Come on.

1:12:23.297 --> 1:12:26.717
Did I keep you waiting long?

1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:31.055
Absolutely.
Did you catch a lot of fish today?

1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:33.849
Well, there was a ton caught on the net.

1:12:34.808 --> 1:12:36.727
Some of your favorite croaker too.

1:12:36.810 --> 1:12:40.606
Gosh, that's my favorite.

1:12:41.273 --> 1:12:44.485
Why don't we grill some for dinner today?

1:12:45.027 --> 1:12:46.820
Sounds delicious!

1:12:48.405 --> 1:12:52.242
Sir, if you don't mind,
could you take a photo of us?

1:12:52.326 --> 1:12:54.244
I'm not good at things like this though.

1:12:54.328 --> 1:12:58.040
It's quite easy.
Look into this lens and press the button.

1:12:59.083 --> 1:13:01.210
-Let me give it a try.
-Thank you.

1:13:01.293 --> 1:13:02.586
Go stand there.

1:13:06.924 --> 1:13:09.468
Hye-jin, smile for the camera.

1:13:09.551 --> 1:13:12.888
But Mom, you were sick just a while ago.

1:13:12.971 --> 1:13:15.891
I'm fine. I'm not sick at all anymore.

1:13:22.398 --> 1:13:24.483
All right. One…

1:13:25.401 --> 1:13:26.902
Two…

1:13:28.987 --> 1:13:29.988
Three!

1:13:32.783 --> 1:13:33.784
Here.

1:13:33.867 --> 1:13:35.077
Thank you, sir.

1:13:35.953 --> 1:13:37.454
Come on. Let's go.

1:13:37.538 --> 1:13:38.539
Thank you.

1:13:53.137 --> 1:13:54.346
Hye-jin.

1:13:54.430 --> 1:13:56.723
One, two, three.

1:14:00.519 --> 1:14:03.814
Why don't we go to the photo studio
and take a photo too?

1:14:03.897 --> 1:14:06.024
Yes, I'd love that!

1:14:18.370 --> 1:14:20.497
<i>WALDEN</i>

1:14:36.096 --> 1:14:38.056
MODERN PHOTO STUDIO

1:15:20.265 --> 1:15:21.558
<i>It's perfect.</i>

1:15:21.642 --> 1:15:23.727
Into the battlefield!

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:26.605
I heard you're going to Seoul today.
Let's go together.

1:15:26.688 --> 1:15:28.857
<i>What? When did this get taken?</i>

1:15:28.941 --> 1:15:30.776
<i>He's not a boyfriend.</i>

1:15:30.859 --> 1:15:33.278
<i>I'm not interested,
but he keeps chasing me.</i>

1:15:33.362 --> 1:15:35.948
<i>Do you want me to wait with you?</i>

1:15:36.031 --> 1:15:38.742
<i>-You must have been in a lot of pain.</i>
-Is it bad?

1:15:38.825 --> 1:15:39.868
Can you please leave?

1:15:39.952 --> 1:15:42.871
You know I grew up this big
because you fed me.

1:15:42.955 --> 1:15:44.331
So, with this…

1:15:44.957 --> 1:15:46.416
<i>Please come back to the clinic.</i>

1:15:47.042 --> 1:15:49.336
<i>But you have to keep it a secret.</i>

1:15:50.963 --> 1:15:55.968
