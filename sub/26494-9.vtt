00:01.176 --> 00:03.011
I know what it's like
to see monsters.

00:03.012 --> 00:05.179
Time to slice and dice.

00:05.181 --> 00:06.881
And I know that when
they're gone...

00:07.950 --> 00:09.383
...they never really go away.

00:09.385 --> 00:11.786
Me and my brother?

00:11.788 --> 00:13.554
We're the guys that stop
the monsters.

00:18.194 --> 00:20.828
We're the guys that
scare <i>them.</i>

00:20.830 --> 00:22.696
Dean!

00:25.234 --> 00:26.967
We had a deal!

00:26.969 --> 00:28.035
Thanks for the suit.

00:28.037 --> 00:29.470
No!

00:30.840 --> 00:32.840
Do you propose we wage a war
on the humans?

00:32.842 --> 00:35.509
There are ways
to enhance your...talents.

00:36.212 --> 00:38.546
Silver bullets aren't working!

00:40.283 --> 00:41.982
Sammy.

00:41.984 --> 00:43.818
When Jack's grace
was taken from him,

00:43.820 --> 00:45.619
his being fell into chaos.

00:45.621 --> 00:47.455
The cells
are gobbling each other up.

00:47.457 --> 00:49.290
Jack!

00:49.292 --> 00:52.493
Before my life is over,
I want to live it.

00:52.495 --> 00:54.295
And when it's all over...

00:54.297 --> 00:55.529
die.

00:55.531 --> 00:57.131
He's gone.

00:57.133 --> 00:59.233
Maybe we should start
thinking about next steps.

00:59.235 --> 01:02.670
Wake and a bonfire,
Hunter style.

01:06.909 --> 01:08.242
Michael wants the spear

01:08.244 --> 01:09.877
because he knows
it can hurt him.

01:12.548 --> 01:13.747
Where is it?!

01:13.749 --> 01:14.982
You're no different
than him.

01:14.984 --> 01:16.817
I am nothing like him.

01:16.819 --> 01:18.552
Get in the damn car!

01:22.925 --> 01:25.593
You're the Empty.

01:27.263 --> 01:29.029
I'm taking him.

01:29.031 --> 01:30.598
Take me.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.433
Deal.

01:32.435 --> 01:34.768
When you finally give yourself
permission to be happy,

01:34.770 --> 01:36.837
that's when I'll come.

03:07.763 --> 03:11.165
Keeping my "appetite up."

03:11.167 --> 03:12.533
Michael?

03:17.607 --> 03:19.173
Why here?

03:19.175 --> 03:21.208
This building, this floor,

03:21.210 --> 03:22.676
cleaning it out

03:22.678 --> 03:24.712
and killing everyone?

03:26.048 --> 03:27.948
I like the view.

03:36.125 --> 03:37.891
Melanie.

03:39.195 --> 03:41.161
These are
the latest volunteers?

03:41.163 --> 03:42.396
Yes, sir --

03:42.398 --> 03:43.731
the last ones.

03:43.733 --> 03:45.232
Two wolves.

03:49.138 --> 03:53.907
This one's a bit scrawny
and a bit familiar.

03:53.909 --> 03:57.177
I recognize you, Garth.

03:57.179 --> 03:58.679
We've met?

03:58.681 --> 04:00.981
'Cause I think
I'd remember that.

04:00.983 --> 04:03.083
Oh, I've spent some time
in Dean Winchester's head --

04:03.085 --> 04:05.419
his, um, memories.

04:05.421 --> 04:06.887
You were his friend.

04:06.889 --> 04:08.355
Still am.

04:08.357 --> 04:09.423
Makes one of us.

04:09.425 --> 04:11.358
But I've got
a family now.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.661
And there's a war coming --
your war.

04:13.663 --> 04:16.764
And whether I like it or not,
for my family --

04:16.766 --> 04:19.033
for my little girl --

04:19.035 --> 04:21.235
I gotta be
on the winning side.

04:27.243 --> 04:30.611
- And we're prepared otherwise?
- We are.

04:30.613 --> 04:35.683
Tomorrow night, Kansas City
won't know what hit it.

05:10.786 --> 05:12.352
Jack, it's the middle
of the night.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.288
Ah, I know. I couldn't wait
till breakfast.

05:14.290 --> 05:17.090
Sam says this stuff
will rot your teeth, but...

05:17.092 --> 05:19.927
- I like it.
- Jack.

05:19.929 --> 05:21.695
If you can't sleep,
that's understandable,

05:21.697 --> 05:23.130
given recent events.

05:23.132 --> 05:26.300
You mean dying
and coming back to life.

05:26.302 --> 05:28.435
Yeah, we've all
been through it.

05:28.437 --> 05:31.972
It's something of a rite
of passage around here.

05:31.974 --> 05:33.707
That's not --

05:35.144 --> 05:37.844
I've been thinking
about Heaven.

05:41.216 --> 05:44.117
My mother.

05:44.119 --> 05:46.186
You think she's safe?

05:46.188 --> 05:48.055
Yeah, of course.

05:48.057 --> 05:51.491
But how could
the Empty get in?

05:51.493 --> 05:54.328
And I thought Heaven was
supposed to be perfect.

05:54.330 --> 05:57.197
No. It's not.

05:57.199 --> 05:59.066
Nothing's perfect, Jack.

05:59.068 --> 06:02.803
But I know Naomi,
and she's complicated,

06:02.805 --> 06:05.472
but there is nothing
that she won't do

06:05.474 --> 06:08.542
to protect the souls
that are in her charge.

06:08.544 --> 06:10.777
Try not to worry, okay?

06:12.715 --> 06:15.349
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:16.819 --> 06:18.685
Cass.

06:18.687 --> 06:21.488
The deal you made...

06:21.490 --> 06:23.323
why can't
Sam and Dean know?

06:26.729 --> 06:29.429
They can. I...

06:29.431 --> 06:30.831
I just don't...

06:30.833 --> 06:33.767
I don't want them to.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.736
They don't need
that burden.

06:35.738 --> 06:38.271
<i>- You</i> don't need that burden.
- Of course I do.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.273
You did that for me.

06:44.413 --> 06:47.614
You know, the Empty said
that it wouldn't come for me

06:47.616 --> 06:53.253
until I had finally given myself
permission to be happy,

06:53.255 --> 06:55.622
but with everything
we have going on, with --

06:55.624 --> 06:58.058
with Michael
still out there,

06:58.060 --> 07:00.627
I don't see that happening
anytime soon.

07:00.629 --> 07:06.266
This life may be a lot of
things, but it's rarely happy.

07:08.137 --> 07:09.903
I'm sorry.

07:12.141 --> 07:13.540
Hey.

07:13.542 --> 07:17.411
At least we have
Krunch Cookie Crunch.

07:17.413 --> 07:19.312
Yeah.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.748
We do.

07:21.750 --> 07:24.518
Did you take the decoder ring
out of the box?

07:26.789 --> 07:29.423
Maybe.

07:29.425 --> 07:31.258
The secret password
is...

07:31.260 --> 07:33.393
"Cookietacular."

07:33.395 --> 07:34.594
Shh.

07:43.138 --> 07:45.138
<i>Sam, that's not all.</i>

07:45.140 --> 07:47.507
They want me to "make the
change," become one of them.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.243
<i>-When?</i>
-I don't know. Soon, I think.

07:50.245 --> 07:53.113
Guess that's what she meant
by "volunteer."

07:53.115 --> 07:55.615
Well, did they say
how it works?

07:55.617 --> 07:56.616
Uh, yeah.

07:56.618 --> 07:57.984
Uh, we're supposed to drink

07:57.986 --> 07:59.953
<i>blood mixed with</i>
<i>Michael's grace.</i>

07:59.955 --> 08:02.489
Garth,
y-you can't do that.

08:02.491 --> 08:04.624
W-We don't know what
that stuff does, you know?

08:04.626 --> 08:05.759
Look, Sam, I knew this
was a risky one.

08:05.761 --> 08:07.127
Besides,
I'll just pull the old

08:07.129 --> 08:08.428
fake-swallow-
and-spit-it-out-later

08:08.430 --> 08:09.529
cough-syrup trick.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.031
- What?
- Used to work on my mom.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.833
<i>- Garth --</i>
- Well, most of the time.

08:12.835 --> 08:15.469
This isn't your mom, Garth.
This is an archangel.

08:15.471 --> 08:16.803
- Hey, dude!
- Oh, got to go.

08:16.805 --> 08:17.971
Where'd you go?

08:17.973 --> 08:20.640
No, Garth --

08:20.642 --> 08:22.209
Garth?

08:22.211 --> 08:24.344
Hey, buddy.
They're ready for us.

08:28.217 --> 08:30.050
Balls.

08:32.654 --> 08:35.388
Garth, huh?
He'll be okay.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.191
He's fooled Michael
this far, right?

08:38.193 --> 08:39.826
Dean, I pulled him
out of retirement

08:39.828 --> 08:41.160
for an
undercover mission.

08:41.163 --> 08:42.828
If something happens to him,
it's on me.

08:42.831 --> 08:44.965
Okay. Hey, look.

08:44.967 --> 08:47.234
Naomi gave us
Michael's location, okay?

08:47.236 --> 08:50.070
We got a spy
on the inside --

08:50.072 --> 08:52.005
for a change,
we're a step ahead.

08:52.007 --> 08:53.974
And given everything
we've pulled off lately,

08:53.976 --> 08:56.009
I like our odds.

08:59.848 --> 09:02.549
It's Ketch.

09:04.419 --> 09:08.421
<i>Mm. Valko's compound</i>
<i>was a breeze,</i>

09:08.423 --> 09:10.090
<i>as it turned out.</i>

09:10.092 --> 09:12.692
<i>Jammed the security system</i>
<i>from the outside,</i>

09:12.694 --> 09:16.329
<i>sedated the guard dogs --</i>
<i>Rottweilers, naturally...</i>

09:16.331 --> 09:18.565
- Ketch.
- Hey. You have it?

09:18.567 --> 09:20.700
<i>Sam, Dean.</i>

09:20.702 --> 09:23.069
<i>What, no "hellos",</i>
<i>"how are yous"?</i>

09:23.071 --> 09:25.071
- No time.
- The egg, Ketch.

09:25.073 --> 09:27.607
<i>And as I was</i>
<i>just telling Jack,</i>

09:27.609 --> 09:31.178
<i>I did, in fact, manage</i>
<i>to expropriate the egg</i>

09:31.180 --> 09:34.114
<i>from a certain Hungarian</i>
<i>rare-weapons collector.</i>

09:34.116 --> 09:37.717
Yeah, uh, uh, Arpad Valko.
W-We got the messages, but so?

09:37.719 --> 09:40.120
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>once I got back to Budapest,</i>

09:40.122 --> 09:41.955
<i>where I was intending</i>
<i>to catch the red-eye</i>

09:41.957 --> 09:44.624
<i>back to the good ole</i>
<i>U.S. of A.,</i>

09:44.626 --> 09:48.795
<i>he unleashed a swarm</i>
<i>of mercenaries upon me.</i>

09:48.797 --> 09:51.398
<i>I was cornered,</i>
<i>and so I was forced to,</i>

09:51.400 --> 09:52.732
<i>I'm afraid,</i>

09:52.734 --> 09:54.701
<i>drop the egg like...</i>

09:54.703 --> 09:57.904
<i>well, to mix a metaphor,</i>
<i>like a hot potato.</i>

09:57.906 --> 10:00.540
- Oh.
- You dropped it?

10:00.542 --> 10:03.543
<i>Never you mind, boys.</i>
<i>I put it somewhere safe.</i>

10:03.545 --> 10:07.214
<i>In fact, it should be arriving</i>
<i>in Lebanon, Kansas,</i>

10:07.216 --> 10:10.317
<i>the day after tomorrow</i>
<i>between, mm...</i>

10:10.319 --> 10:12.385
<i>2:00 and 6:00 p.m.</i>

10:12.387 --> 10:15.088
You put the only weapon
we have against Michael...

10:15.090 --> 10:16.156
in the mail?

10:16.158 --> 10:17.824
<i>Ah, not just any mail.</i>

10:17.826 --> 10:19.125
<i>I paid extra.</i>

10:19.127 --> 10:21.261
<i>Certified Priority Express.</i>

10:21.263 --> 10:22.495
He paid extra.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.632
<i>Look, I improvised.</i>

10:25.634 --> 10:27.434
<i>It's not</i>
<i>as if I have access</i>

10:27.436 --> 10:29.436
<i>to the top-shelf clandestine</i>
<i>courier networks I did</i>

10:29.438 --> 10:31.671
<i>during my</i>
<i>British Men of Letters days.</i>

10:31.673 --> 10:35.275
<i>And really, so,</i>
<i>whose fault is that, hmm?</i>

10:37.613 --> 10:39.012
Okay, K-Ketch, we're --
we're not mad,

10:39.014 --> 10:41.681
- W-We appreciate the effort.
- Do we?

10:41.683 --> 10:44.484
It's just that big Michael stuff
is going down soon.

10:44.486 --> 10:48.188
We -- We -- We kind of
needed the egg...now.

10:51.426 --> 10:53.493
<i>Oh. Well, um...</i>

10:59.034 --> 11:00.634
<i>Sorry, chaps.</i>

11:29.698 --> 11:33.166
Buddy of mine,
he "made the change."

11:33.168 --> 11:35.135
Says he's immune
to silver now.

11:35.137 --> 11:37.037
- Pretty cool, right?
- Mm.

11:37.039 --> 11:39.479
The only thing that can take him
down now is the Full Ichabod.

11:41.043 --> 11:43.209
- Khhht!
- Oh.

11:43.211 --> 11:45.078
Says he's never felt
so great.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.480
Called archangel grace,

11:47.482 --> 11:51.117
the ultimate powerup --
a real Chug Jug.

11:52.321 --> 11:53.920
Dude, "Fortnite."

11:53.922 --> 11:55.855
Oh, yeah.

12:04.866 --> 12:06.232
Drink up.

12:35.530 --> 12:37.430
You have nothing to fear.

12:37.432 --> 12:39.766
Only about one in seven
volunteers explode

12:39.768 --> 12:41.067
when they drink it.

12:42.437 --> 12:44.904
Russian roulette odds.
I like it.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.209
Well, <i>sláinte.</i>

13:04.059 --> 13:05.492
All gone?

13:18.106 --> 13:19.939
All gone.

13:23.845 --> 13:26.179
She's been seen
taking shelter

13:26.181 --> 13:29.282
at an abandoned recycling
facility outside Omaha.

13:29.284 --> 13:30.702
What would you like me
to do?

13:30.703 --> 13:31.507
You feel that, buddy?

13:31.531 --> 13:34.121
My pulse is up a bit,
and I'm a bit sweaty.

13:34.122 --> 13:37.128
Send a team. Kill her
and destroy the spear.

13:37.129 --> 13:38.958
I want it off the board
before tomorrow night.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.461
Damn. I wish we could
sneak off to the gym.

13:41.463 --> 13:43.196
I can feel them
drawing closer...

13:43.198 --> 13:45.365
- Yeah, bro.
- ...each and every monster I've turned...

13:45.367 --> 13:47.467
It's different than when I went wolf.
That was, like, white, hot energy, remember?

13:47.469 --> 13:49.202
...taking their positions
throughout the city...

13:49.204 --> 13:51.171
...waiting for my order.
- This? It's...

13:51.173 --> 13:53.206
Oh, boy, I take it back.

13:53.208 --> 13:57.010
- This is strong stuff.
- And your order...

13:57.012 --> 13:58.845
what will it be?

14:05.487 --> 14:07.687
- Well?
- It's not far.

14:07.689 --> 14:10.523
It's being held at a hub
facility in Joplin, Missouri.

14:10.525 --> 14:12.559
Apparently, it would've
made it to Lebanon

14:12.561 --> 14:13.960
if it weren't closed
for the holiday.

14:13.962 --> 14:15.795
Well, if they're closed...

14:15.797 --> 14:17.063
Means we can get it.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.998
How?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.366
We break in.

14:26.041 --> 14:27.140
Garth.

14:27.142 --> 14:28.308
Hey.

14:28.310 --> 14:29.876
<i>Hey, Sam.</i>

14:29.878 --> 14:31.845
<i>Michael's sending some guys</i>
<i>after...someone.</i>

14:31.847 --> 14:34.681
They're headed to an old
recycling plant north of Omaha.

14:34.683 --> 14:37.050
<i>Uh, says he wants them</i>
<i>to get a weapon.</i>

14:37.052 --> 14:39.419
A spear?

14:39.421 --> 14:41.554
<i>That mean anything to you?</i>

14:41.556 --> 14:43.523
Uh, yeah. I have an idea.

14:43.525 --> 14:45.325
But what about you?
How are you?

14:45.327 --> 14:46.593
<i>Were you able</i>
<i>to fake 'em out?</i>

14:46.595 --> 14:49.028
Oh, yeah. All good.

14:49.030 --> 14:50.597
Uh, but --
But what?

14:50.599 --> 14:53.366
There's more.
I heard Michael's plan.

14:55.403 --> 14:57.737
The whole damn town?

14:57.739 --> 15:00.039
It's gonna be
a bloodbath.

15:00.041 --> 15:02.675
All of Michael's monsters
activating all at once,

15:02.677 --> 15:05.945
attacking, turning everyone
in Kansas City?

15:05.947 --> 15:08.114
It's his army.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.250
And all on a night
when nobody's guard's up --

15:10.252 --> 15:12.352
all nogged up,
waiting for Santa.

15:12.354 --> 15:14.621
- Merry freakin' Christmas.
- Yeah, well, Garth said

15:14.623 --> 15:16.356
Michael was gonna give
the signal at midnight,

15:16.358 --> 15:17.857
so if we can get to him
before he does...

15:17.859 --> 15:19.459
Then we can stop this.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.127
And with the spear
still in play,

15:21.129 --> 15:22.762
that can hurt Michael.

15:22.764 --> 15:24.631
Given as much trouble as he's
gone through to find it,

15:24.633 --> 15:26.432
it might do worse.

15:26.434 --> 15:28.601
Could be a shot at actually
killing the son of a bitch.

15:28.603 --> 15:30.570
And we may be able
to trap him.

15:30.572 --> 15:32.705
I mean, Bobby's been working
on those angel cuffs.

15:32.707 --> 15:33.973
They might be able
to hold him.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.441
Yeah, and --
and getting the egg?

15:35.443 --> 15:36.776
I mean,
we have Rowena's spell.

15:36.778 --> 15:38.378
We can put Michael
back in the Cage.

15:38.380 --> 15:39.979
It's literally a trip
to the post office.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.282
Okay, well, getting the spear
is literally a trip

15:42.284 --> 15:45.385
to the Carter Lake
recycling facilities.

15:45.387 --> 15:46.986
I say we get both.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.655
Me and Cass -- we'll go deal
with Michael's monsters

15:48.657 --> 15:49.923
and get the spear.

15:49.925 --> 15:51.257
You and Jack --

15:51.259 --> 15:53.126
you do your mail run
and get the egg.

15:53.128 --> 15:56.229
We'll meet back at Hitomi Plaza
with both weapons,

15:56.231 --> 15:57.931
and we'll hit him
from both sides.

16:22.023 --> 16:23.656
You seem good lately.

16:23.658 --> 16:25.358
Happy, even.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.859
You --

16:26.861 --> 16:28.595
We have
a broken tape deck,

16:28.597 --> 16:30.463
we drove this whole way
without music,

16:30.465 --> 16:32.966
and you did not complain once.

16:32.968 --> 16:35.602
You know, I guess
I'm just fired up.

16:35.604 --> 16:37.303
I mean, look. We got --
We got Jack back.

16:37.305 --> 16:38.705
When was
the last time we had

16:38.707 --> 16:40.807
a big, no-strings-attached
win like that?

16:45.614 --> 16:47.513
But now we have Michael.

16:47.515 --> 16:49.949
I know.

16:49.951 --> 16:51.351
And, Dean...

16:51.353 --> 16:52.952
we're taking a big risk

16:52.954 --> 16:54.621
going after the spear
like this.

16:54.623 --> 16:56.155
I know we are.

16:56.157 --> 16:58.891
Listen to me.
Michael conned me.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.728
Kept me trapped and drowning
inside my own body.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.730
Now, when you and Sam
were possessed by Lucifer,

17:03.732 --> 17:05.397
I -- I thought
I understood,

17:05.400 --> 17:09.402
but I didn't,
not really.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.971
So, yeah, if we get
a chance to trap him,

17:11.973 --> 17:13.740
I'll take that,

17:13.742 --> 17:16.576
but I won't be truly happy
until he is dead

17:16.578 --> 17:18.778
and <i>I</i> kill him.

17:20.015 --> 17:22.515
And now I have
a chance to do that,

17:22.517 --> 17:25.685
so, yeah, I'm good.

17:25.686 --> 17:27.020
Let's go.

17:57.719 --> 17:59.185
All right.

17:59.187 --> 18:01.888
That should take care
of the security system.

18:01.890 --> 18:03.156
May I?

18:04.726 --> 18:07.327
Oh. Sure.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.933
I used to be able to do this
just by touching the handle.

18:15.403 --> 18:17.370
Who taught you
how to pick a lock?

18:17.372 --> 18:18.738
I did.

18:18.740 --> 18:20.973
And the Internet.

18:20.975 --> 18:24.077
I just...wanted
to stay useful.

18:31.786 --> 18:33.086
Nice work.

19:48.396 --> 19:49.729
I don't think she's here.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.564
Well, she was.

19:51.566 --> 19:53.733
The food's still warm,

19:53.735 --> 19:56.269
so either she took a hike
or she's hiding.

19:58.339 --> 20:01.674
Dean, where
are Michael's forces?

20:01.676 --> 20:04.911
We're going off <i>their</i> Intel,
and they had a head start.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.746
And a shorter drive.

20:06.748 --> 20:10.349
Do you think
they already got her?

20:10.351 --> 20:13.252
Well, there's no signs
of a struggle.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.921
The Dark Kaia I know?

20:14.923 --> 20:17.323
She wouldn't have gone out
without a fight.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.162
It's lighter
than I expected.

20:23.164 --> 20:24.730
Yeah, it'll do the job.

20:24.732 --> 20:26.065
"Happy Holidays."

20:42.083 --> 20:43.916
Sam!

20:43.918 --> 20:45.785
Jack!

20:48.590 --> 20:49.689
Jack!

20:51.292 --> 20:53.793
- Jack!
- I wouldn't.

20:55.230 --> 20:56.729
Hey, Sam.

20:59.734 --> 21:01.067
Michael.

21:01.069 --> 21:04.270
Happy holidays.

21:15.680 --> 21:18.280
How'd you find us?

21:18.282 --> 21:20.783
What are you gonna do,
Sam, hmm?

21:25.957 --> 21:28.290
You're gonna kill me,
anyways.

21:44.642 --> 21:46.876
No.

21:46.878 --> 21:48.377
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

22:02.727 --> 22:05.794
Still no answer?

22:05.796 --> 22:07.296
No.

22:07.298 --> 22:08.764
I --

22:08.766 --> 22:09.899
Sam?

22:09.901 --> 22:11.100
It's Garth.

22:11.102 --> 22:12.568
Hey, Garth.

22:12.570 --> 22:14.436
Hey, Dean.
Uh, I tried to call Sam, but --

22:14.438 --> 22:16.338
No answer. Yeah.
Us, too.

22:16.340 --> 22:19.775
Yeah. Um, listen.
Michael left a few minutes ago.

22:19.777 --> 22:22.077
I overheard him say he was going
to back up his forces.

22:22.079 --> 22:23.479
Oh, do you mean
the "forces"

22:23.481 --> 22:24.747
that are supposed to
be here at Omaha?

22:24.749 --> 22:25.948
Because they
are definitely not.

22:25.950 --> 22:27.316
<i>What?</i>

22:27.318 --> 22:29.351
Dean, I swear.
Michael said --

22:29.353 --> 22:32.855
It's okay. Just...call us
if you hear anything, okay?

22:32.857 --> 22:35.257
Got it.

22:36.460 --> 22:38.527
Garth.

22:38.529 --> 22:39.795
Let's talk.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.534
- So, what, was this a setup?
- I don't know.

22:45.536 --> 22:48.170
Well, what do we do? Do we --
Do we go to Hitomi Plaza?

22:48.172 --> 22:50.806
- Do we go t-to Joplin, Missouri?
- Dean!

22:57.281 --> 22:59.281
- Why are you here?
- Hey.

22:59.283 --> 23:01.350
What do you want?

23:01.352 --> 23:03.519
Cass. Cass, no.

23:05.690 --> 23:07.690
You know what we want.

23:11.462 --> 23:13.696
You think you can
take this from me?

23:13.698 --> 23:15.898
You've tried before.

23:17.535 --> 23:21.804
Look, we didn't come
to fight you for it.

23:21.806 --> 23:23.739
I came to ask.

23:25.409 --> 23:28.177
You should know by now
I won't give it up.

23:31.182 --> 23:33.048
Well, then,
you should just kill me.

23:39.390 --> 23:42.157
There are people
that I care about --

23:42.159 --> 23:44.760
my family --

23:44.762 --> 23:46.762
and they're in danger.

23:46.764 --> 23:49.031
Michael,
the one who tortured me,

23:49.033 --> 23:50.566
the one
who tortured you --

23:50.568 --> 23:54.036
he's gonna hurt them
and kill them.

23:54.038 --> 23:55.704
And then, worse.

23:55.706 --> 23:58.540
<i>Thousands</i> will die.

23:58.542 --> 24:00.743
And the only thing in this world
that will stop him

24:00.745 --> 24:03.412
is the spear
in your hands.

24:05.683 --> 24:08.350
So if you're not gonna
give it to me,

24:08.352 --> 24:10.185
kill me.

24:22.700 --> 24:25.000
What'll you do for me?

24:26.137 --> 24:28.237
What do you want?

24:28.239 --> 24:30.572
I want to go back.

24:30.574 --> 24:33.075
- To the Bad Place?
- I call it home.

24:33.077 --> 24:35.044
But you came to this world
for a reason.

24:35.046 --> 24:38.414
I came here to escape a life
of running from monsters.

24:38.416 --> 24:41.116
But here, it's no different,
not for me.

24:41.118 --> 24:43.085
Michael's monsters
haven't stopped hunting me.

24:43.087 --> 24:45.454
At least over there,
I understood things --

24:45.456 --> 24:47.823
the world, my place in it.

24:47.825 --> 24:49.591
The magic
I used to get here,

24:49.593 --> 24:51.894
magic from my home --
it doesn't work here.

24:51.896 --> 24:54.129
To get back, I need help.

24:54.131 --> 24:55.664
We'll do what we can.

24:55.666 --> 24:57.433
The boy.

24:57.435 --> 25:00.135
The special boy.

25:00.137 --> 25:02.638
The one that used Kaia
to open up the door?

25:02.640 --> 25:05.174
He can do it again,
for me.

25:05.176 --> 25:07.676
Yes, he can.

25:07.678 --> 25:11.347
And he will, if...

25:11.349 --> 25:13.482
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

25:16.487 --> 25:18.354
You don't.

25:18.356 --> 25:20.989
Just like we don't know
<i>you're</i> telling the truth.

25:20.991 --> 25:23.292
But we do know that
you are hiding something.

25:23.294 --> 25:25.661
Like Dean said,
you came here for a reason,

25:25.663 --> 25:28.364
but if you're so desperate
to return,

25:28.366 --> 25:30.799
you're so driven
that you would consider

25:30.801 --> 25:33.969
giving up your spear...

25:33.971 --> 25:37.106
well, that means you have
a new reason,

25:37.108 --> 25:38.707
something you're not
telling us.

25:41.178 --> 25:44.179
You have people you feel
bound to protect,

25:44.181 --> 25:45.647
to save.

25:48.319 --> 25:49.852
So do I.

25:59.630 --> 26:01.864
If you don't
bring this back to me,

26:01.866 --> 26:03.966
I will find you
and kill you.

26:13.477 --> 26:16.545
- How will we track you down?
- You've done it before.

26:16.547 --> 26:18.380
Do it again.

26:30.528 --> 26:32.261
Cass, hey.

26:32.263 --> 26:33.729
Sam?

26:33.731 --> 26:36.598
It was Michael.
He knew where we were.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.400
He got the drop on us
and destroyed the egg,

26:38.402 --> 26:40.369
and, uh...

26:40.371 --> 26:42.171
Dean, he's got Jack.

26:47.279 --> 26:49.447
- Sam?
<i>- Hey. It was Michael.</i>

26:50.553 --> 26:52.220
<i>He knew where we were.</i>

26:52.222 --> 26:53.354
<i>He got the drop on us</i>
<i>and destroyed the egg,</i>

26:53.356 --> 26:54.388
<i>and, uh...</i>

26:54.390 --> 26:55.957
<i>Dean, he's got Jack.</i>

26:57.160 --> 26:58.559
How did you escape?

26:58.561 --> 27:00.228
I didn't.
He knocked me out.

27:00.230 --> 27:01.796
I...

27:01.798 --> 27:03.364
I don't know why
he didn't kill me.

27:03.366 --> 27:05.566
- So, what -- is he playing us?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

27:05.568 --> 27:07.502
I mean, Garth's not answering
my phone calls.

27:07.504 --> 27:09.203
Best guess --
Jack's in Kansas City

27:09.205 --> 27:10.705
and that it's still game time
for Michael there.

27:10.707 --> 27:12.507
I -- I'm gonna
head there now.

27:12.509 --> 27:15.343
Okay. Hey,
we got the spear,

27:15.345 --> 27:17.411
so we'll meet you there.
- Great.

27:17.413 --> 27:19.080
<i>-And, Sam...</i>
-Yeah?

27:19.082 --> 27:20.815
...don't you
go in there alone.

27:20.817 --> 27:22.350
<i>I know.</i>

27:22.352 --> 27:23.885
Drive fast.

27:41.938 --> 27:45.072
Why am I here?

27:45.074 --> 27:47.575
Why didn't you
just kill me?

27:47.577 --> 27:51.045
In your present,
powerless condition?

27:51.047 --> 27:53.414
Why would I bother?

27:53.416 --> 27:56.083
Are you familiar
with Kansas City --

27:56.085 --> 27:59.754
the people, the terrain?

27:59.756 --> 28:03.691
Back in my world, I enlisted
a garrison to invade it.

28:03.693 --> 28:06.193
We leveled it.

28:06.195 --> 28:07.795
Death from above.

28:07.797 --> 28:10.798
But there was
human resistance.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.466
Things got messy.

28:12.468 --> 28:14.201
I'm trying something
different this time --

28:14.203 --> 28:16.771
an insurgency
from within.

28:16.773 --> 28:18.739
My monster army turning

28:18.741 --> 28:20.875
every last
man, woman, and child --

28:20.877 --> 28:22.977
a wave
of transformation.

28:22.979 --> 28:25.313
Vampires or werewolves --
it won't matter which.

28:25.315 --> 28:28.049
Everyone they turn
will be mine.

28:28.051 --> 28:29.884
No muss, no fuss.

28:29.886 --> 28:33.454
Why would you think I want
to hear any of this?

28:33.456 --> 28:34.789
I hate you.

28:34.791 --> 28:37.458
Oh, but, Jack,
we're family.

28:37.460 --> 28:38.993
You know, in fact,

28:38.995 --> 28:43.130
we're the only kin each other
has left in this world.

28:43.132 --> 28:46.100
My uncle's in the Cage.

28:46.102 --> 28:48.669
And you --
you're not family.

28:48.671 --> 28:50.605
Well, not literally, no.

28:50.607 --> 28:53.441
Our connection,
our relation

28:53.443 --> 28:55.142
is more a matter
of scale...

28:55.144 --> 28:56.410
of power.

28:56.412 --> 28:58.245
Haven't you learned yet?

28:58.247 --> 29:01.248
In this reality, monsters,
humans, even angels --

29:01.250 --> 29:03.084
they are insects,

29:03.086 --> 29:05.353
atoms compared to us.

29:05.355 --> 29:07.121
But you --

29:07.123 --> 29:10.458
you're just a child,
a mere infant.

29:10.460 --> 29:11.792
For you,
the past two years --

29:11.794 --> 29:13.694
the entirety
of your existence --

29:13.696 --> 29:15.496
feel like eons.

29:15.498 --> 29:17.999
You don't even know
what time is.

29:20.436 --> 29:22.770
But you will.

29:22.772 --> 29:26.707
Real time, the time
that makes mountains,

29:26.709 --> 29:29.010
that wipes out species.

29:29.012 --> 29:32.213
You'll see it all...
with me.

29:34.617 --> 29:35.816
No.

29:35.818 --> 29:38.853
Year by year,
century by century,

29:38.855 --> 29:41.856
and as your power
returns and grows,

29:41.858 --> 29:44.158
we'll only become
more alike.

29:46.362 --> 29:47.862
Oh, I know.

29:47.864 --> 29:51.499
Your loyalty to Castiel,
the Winchesters,

29:51.501 --> 29:53.734
the rest of humanity?

29:53.736 --> 29:55.369
It will fade.

29:57.306 --> 29:59.073
And so will the minor
differences --

29:59.075 --> 30:01.575
angel armies
versus monster armies,

30:01.577 --> 30:04.078
this Kansas City
or that Kansas City,

30:04.080 --> 30:06.881
one world from another --

30:06.883 --> 30:08.683
they'll fade, too.

30:12.021 --> 30:15.456
Sam, Dean, and Castiel.

30:17.026 --> 30:19.026
They'll come for me.

30:20.229 --> 30:22.063
Mm.

30:39.916 --> 30:41.382
You have
your coordinates?

30:41.384 --> 30:42.717
Uh, yes, sir.

30:42.719 --> 30:43.951
The Cathedral
on Oak Street --

30:43.953 --> 30:45.853
embed myself
in the Christmas mass,

30:45.855 --> 30:47.588
wait for Michael's signal.

30:47.590 --> 30:48.723
All right.

30:53.896 --> 30:55.796
You can go now.

31:47.183 --> 31:48.849
- Jack.
- Sam?

31:48.851 --> 31:50.618
Hey.

31:50.620 --> 31:51.919
Where's Michael?

31:51.921 --> 31:53.420
Ahh. I don't know.

31:53.422 --> 31:54.955
Come on. Let's go.

31:54.957 --> 31:56.490
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:56.492 --> 31:57.925
Shh, shh.

32:07.203 --> 32:08.702
- Garth.
- Hey.

32:08.704 --> 32:10.471
- You're okay.
- Yeah.

32:11.874 --> 32:14.008
Great.
Let's get out of here.

32:16.813 --> 32:18.279
All right.

32:18.281 --> 32:20.114
Dean and Cass
are almost here.

32:20.116 --> 32:22.116
They got the spear.
As soon as they get here,

32:22.118 --> 32:24.351
we regroup, go upstairs...
- Kick Michael's ass.

32:24.353 --> 32:25.986
Yep.

32:29.025 --> 32:30.324
Garth?

32:37.633 --> 32:39.133
Jack!

32:39.135 --> 32:41.368
Oh, Sam. He's in my head.

32:41.370 --> 32:42.736
He won't stop.

32:42.738 --> 32:44.672
He won't let me stop.

32:48.744 --> 32:50.644
- Garth.
- I'm sorry.

32:59.635 --> 33:01.068
Hey, don't do this.

33:01.070 --> 33:02.302
You don't
have to do this.

33:02.304 --> 33:03.737
Garth.

33:07.109 --> 33:09.777
You can fight this.
You can fight this one.

33:11.180 --> 33:12.913
Ohh!

33:22.992 --> 33:24.391
Sorry, Garth.

33:25.761 --> 33:27.094
I'm sorry.

33:37.106 --> 33:38.505
Sleep tight, buddy.

33:39.975 --> 33:42.142
Well, thanks for waiting
for us.

33:44.313 --> 33:45.779
I didn't have a choice.

33:48.617 --> 33:50.984
He drank
Michael's grace.

33:50.986 --> 33:52.352
Why didn't he tell me?

33:52.354 --> 33:53.854
I don't know.

33:55.958 --> 33:58.072
When Garth turned, I think
it gave Michael a window.

33:58.521 --> 34:00.662
I think he was spying
on us through him.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.529
I think that's how Michael
knew where we'd be,

34:02.531 --> 34:04.798
how he got the jump
on us.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.467
All right, well,
Garth's on ice now.

34:06.469 --> 34:08.601
You know, maybe if we kill
Michael, it'll cure him.

34:08.603 --> 34:09.837
Well, I-I called
the other Hunters.

34:09.839 --> 34:10.804
They're on their way.

34:10.806 --> 34:12.539
Take care of the city,

34:12.541 --> 34:14.875
in case we don't win
up there.

34:18.313 --> 34:21.181
I wouldn't bet against us,
you know?

34:21.183 --> 34:22.882
Hyah. Hyah.

34:22.885 --> 34:24.717
Ah! Whoa. Ah!

34:24.719 --> 34:27.154
I got it. It's cool.
It's good.

34:29.692 --> 34:30.991
How we looking
over there?

34:30.993 --> 34:32.693
Good as new.

34:36.998 --> 34:38.966
Jack.

34:40.503 --> 34:44.004
He's up there,
waiting for us.

34:44.005 --> 34:48.342
You know, Michael's monsters
are all over this city.

34:48.344 --> 34:51.078
If he feared us
in the least,

34:51.080 --> 34:52.813
he would've sent
some our way.

34:52.815 --> 34:54.014
Yeah, well,
he could've killed me

34:54.016 --> 34:55.748
back at
the shipping facility.

34:55.751 --> 34:58.519
I think he wanted us to come here.

34:58.521 --> 35:00.154
We have to remember --

35:00.156 --> 35:01.889
Michael will sense
my approach.

35:01.891 --> 35:04.391
So zero element
of surprise.

35:04.393 --> 35:05.826
Walking right into
a trap.

35:05.828 --> 35:07.728
Which is set
by a full-power archangel.

35:09.231 --> 35:11.365
Impossible odds.

35:12.735 --> 35:14.401
Feels like home.

35:16.071 --> 35:17.404
Let's do it.

35:22.077 --> 35:26.113
♪ Freude,
schoener Goetterfunken ♪

35:26.115 --> 35:29.950
♪ Tochter aus Elysium ♪

35:29.952 --> 35:33.921
♪ Wir betreten feuertrunken ♪

35:33.923 --> 35:38.025
♪ Himmlische, dein Heiligtum! ♪

35:51.462 --> 35:53.662
Come on, fellas.

35:56.300 --> 35:58.400
You're gonna miss the show.

36:25.529 --> 36:27.529
Mm.

36:29.567 --> 36:33.001
There he is.

36:47.084 --> 36:50.018
Castiel.

36:50.020 --> 36:53.756
You do realize
I can feel you in here.

36:53.758 --> 36:55.858
There's really no need
to be...

36:57.862 --> 36:59.061
...coy.

36:59.063 --> 37:01.096
Michael.

37:06.804 --> 37:08.470
Tell me something, Cass.

37:08.472 --> 37:09.872
Why'd you come alone?

37:09.874 --> 37:12.708
Advance scout?
Strongest player first?

37:16.747 --> 37:18.747
Not that strong.

37:18.749 --> 37:21.784
But, hey, if they want to miss
all the festivities,

37:21.786 --> 37:23.886
well, then that's...

37:23.888 --> 37:24.920
...their...

37:24.922 --> 37:25.921
loss.

37:27.658 --> 37:29.458
But I got a schedule
to keep.

37:56.153 --> 37:57.853
You got it.

37:57.855 --> 37:59.455
I sure did.

38:16.674 --> 38:19.107
I'm so glad
you could make it tonight.

38:19.109 --> 38:22.010
I know you hate me, Dean,
but don't forget --

38:22.012 --> 38:23.612
you let me in.

38:26.784 --> 38:28.150
And now
you get to see it --

38:28.152 --> 38:30.986
everything your mistake
will make possible --

38:30.988 --> 38:33.889
all the bloodshed,
all the death --

38:33.891 --> 38:35.691
all on you.

38:35.693 --> 38:37.493
Dean!

38:46.170 --> 38:48.370
Trust me.

38:48.372 --> 38:50.038
That's gonna leave a scar.

38:57.715 --> 38:59.481
Kill him!

39:09.193 --> 39:10.526
Dean?

39:22.039 --> 39:24.072
Dean?

39:44.261 --> 39:45.761
No.

39:45.763 --> 39:47.596
Yeah.

39:51.735 --> 39:55.270
When I gave up Dean,
you didn't think to question it,

39:55.272 --> 39:58.073
to ask why?

39:58.075 --> 40:01.076
Dean was...

40:01.078 --> 40:03.645
resisting me.

40:03.647 --> 40:06.481
He was
too attached to you,

40:06.483 --> 40:09.284
to all of you.

40:09.286 --> 40:12.921
He wouldn't
stop squirming --

40:12.923 --> 40:15.457
to get out, to get back.

40:15.459 --> 40:18.060
So I left...

40:18.062 --> 40:21.830
but not without leaving
the door open...

40:21.832 --> 40:23.165
just a crack.

40:25.936 --> 40:27.569
Why wait?

40:27.571 --> 40:32.474
To break him, to crush
and disappoint him so completely

40:32.476 --> 40:36.778
that, this time, he'll be
nice and quiet for a change --

40:36.780 --> 40:38.780
buried.

40:38.782 --> 40:41.516
And he is.

40:41.518 --> 40:42.851
He's gone.

40:47.291 --> 40:49.124
And now...

40:49.126 --> 40:51.760
I have a whole army
out there,

40:51.762 --> 40:54.796
waiting,
ready for my command,

40:54.798 --> 40:58.033
ready...for this.
