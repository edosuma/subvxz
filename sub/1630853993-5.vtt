Ms Bello claims the affair
happened four years ago,

00:04.440 --> 00:06.160
while the MP was visiting Nigeria.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.680
Those are the guys
I saw getting into the grey van.

00:08.680 --> 00:11.320
To tell you the truth, I'd rather
avoid this place altogether.

00:11.320 --> 00:14.320
Not easy when half your clients
are in the same building.

00:14.320 --> 00:17.120
Actually, Mr Knox,
I came to ask for your help.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.800

00:26.920 --> 00:28.560
Vanguard needs a new home.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.880
You accuse me of sabotage, and...

00:30.880 --> 00:32.480
..and now you want my help.

00:32.480 --> 00:35.920
China's going to lose the facial-rec
bid. The US are waiting in line.

Guilt and regret.

This isn't about facial rec -
this is about me.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.720
I beg your pardon, Mr Turner?
I said, I hope you're proud,

00:51.720 --> 00:53.400
forcing my family away
from their home.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.840
He looks like you.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.280
What? Victoria Bello's son, Amandi.

Your paternity test has come back
negative - you must be delighted.

01:08.320 --> 01:12.600
Why do you think she made those
claims? I understand.

01:12.600 --> 01:16.120

lengths to jump the queue.

and stopped looking
like you're about to hit me.

It's probably why they asked me
to get you.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.400

I've always been Team Zac.

11:04.600 --> 11:08.280
To be fair, that is true. Even when
I was fired, you answered my calls.

through. Yeah. Fucking Vodafone.

But then again,
maybe it was just a decoy

11:13.680 --> 11:16.440

you to do, which was to dig up

11:16.440 --> 11:19.200

16:56.000 --> 16:57.520
CHUCKLING

16:57.520 --> 17:01.280
Although this remains
a UK counterterrorism operation,

17:01.280 --> 17:05.200
inside this building
you are in US territory,

17:05.200 --> 17:07.960
and you will operate in accordance
with US laws,

17:07.960 --> 17:11.240
regulations,
and standard operating procedures.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.600
Our hosts will be on hand at
all times

17:13.600 --> 17:17.760
to support us through
any, uh, cultural differences.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.960
Connor here will be leading a
support team

17:20.960 --> 17:23.840
of technical operatives, alongside
someone many of you will be

17:23.840 --> 17:26.200
acquainted with already,
our very own DI Phillips,

17:26.200 --> 17:28.520
who's been on secondment here
for the past six months,

17:28.520 --> 17:31.200
and I'm pleased to say
hasn't picked up the accent.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.200
CHUCKLING

17:33.200 --> 17:36.600
Um, I know you're all
still reeling from

17:36.600 --> 17:42.120
the tragic loss
of Detective Sergeant Patrick Flynn,

17:42.120 --> 17:44.840
Specialist Firearms Officer
Jason McKenna

17:44.840 --> 17:47.200
and Specialist Firearms Officer
Lee Bradbury.

17:48.320 --> 17:53.280
But the way to...honour
our fallen colleagues...

17:55.320 --> 17:58.800
..is to catch the scum
that took their lives.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.480
Thank you, sir.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.120
As Commander Hart said...

18:06.120 --> 18:09.280
Is he going to maintain
his stiff upper lip?

18:09.280 --> 18:11.160
I think I see it quivering.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.080
..with a much wider range

18:14.080 --> 18:16.360
of intelligence-gathering tools
at our disposal.

18:16.360 --> 18:17.760
Now, given the urgency,

18:17.760 --> 18:20.680
we've begun analysing existing data
from the operation,

18:20.680 --> 18:22.920
and we've uncovered
a few truffles already.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.800
Danny? Sir?

18:32.480 --> 18:35.160
A long time since
you called me that.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.240
I just wanted to say thank you.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.480
That was the team talk
we all needed.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.600
It's the last one
you'll hear me give.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.520
I stopped by the Commissioner's
office this morning.

18:48.520 --> 18:51.320
Handed in my 7-28.
You're resigning?

18:51.320 --> 18:53.240
After Vanguard, I'm out.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.880
Don't worry, Gemma.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.960
I didn't give the real reason.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.960
I'm in the middle of a meeting.
I've got about two minutes.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.840
Did you have to interview her?

19:17.840 --> 19:19.120
I beg your pardon?

19:19.120 --> 19:21.800
Victoria Bello.
Was that really necessary?

19:21.800 --> 19:23.720
SHE SCOFFS

19:21.800 --> 19:23.720
Last time I checked,

19:23.720 --> 19:26.400
I'm not required
to justify my editorial choices

19:26.400 --> 19:29.400
to the authorities. We're not living
in a police state yet.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.560
Well, I hope it was worth it. Cos
Isaac Turner is now out of the deal.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.440
What, because of that? Oh, please.

19:34.440 --> 19:38.320
You do not understand. I understand
perfectly. I will call Zac myself,

19:38.320 --> 19:40.320
show the requisite humility.

19:40.320 --> 19:43.040
It's a dance.
You'd do well to learn the steps.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.440
Learn this!
I was with Isaac Turner an hour ago.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.120
He wouldn't even admit we had a
deal! He doesn't trust us,

19:48.120 --> 19:51.520
and that is your fault.
Lower your tone.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.240
I don't let anyone raise their voice
at me off camera.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.880
I am not anyone!
You have fucked it up, Khadija.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.360
For all of us!

20:04.480 --> 20:06.240
I thought we said three o'clock?

20:06.240 --> 20:08.200
I'd rather be early - always.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.160
How much did you hear?

20:12.280 --> 20:13.680
Nothing.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.960
I brought your comms.

20:16.960 --> 20:20.040
And I thought you'd
want to know there's a new lead.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.360
Take me to the new base.
I'll follow.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.880
After the presentation,

20:29.880 --> 20:32.720
the Home Secretary will make
what he promises will be

20:32.720 --> 20:34.400
a short announcement,

20:34.400 --> 20:37.720
and the Security Minister will take
questions from the press.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.280
APPLAUSE

20:43.120 --> 20:46.920
Britain's border security
will soon be bolstered

20:46.920 --> 20:49.440
by a digital layer of protection,

20:49.440 --> 20:53.120
provided by a company
who count among their clients

20:53.120 --> 20:54.640
the US Pentagon.

20:54.640 --> 20:57.200
All of us who value the security

20:57.200 --> 20:59.760
and sovereignty of our nation

20:59.760 --> 21:04.520
will value the support
of Clear Horizons AI. Thank you.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.240
Care to make a statement about
Victoria Bello? Have you spoken

21:07.240 --> 21:09.440
to Isaac Turner today, Home
Secretary? Did anyone

21:09.440 --> 21:10.640
at the Home Office obstruct

21:10.640 --> 21:13.280
Victoria Bello's application,
Home Secretary? Thank you.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.200
This is where the magic happens.

21:45.200 --> 21:48.600
Tom. What have I missed?
Lots, by the looks of things.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.800
Well, that's what comes of skipping
the briefings.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.800
We can't hold the class up
just for you, Carey.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.680
I've been on compassionate leave,
so...

21:55.680 --> 21:57.080
..be compassionate.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.880
No time for compassion.
Not in the middle of a manhunt.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.680
Who's the target?

22:11.680 --> 22:15.000
A Russian National. Nikolai Mirsky.

22:16.440 --> 22:19.880
We've got every facial-rec system
in the UK looking for him

22:19.880 --> 22:22.360
and every ANPR looking
for his van.

22:24.800 --> 22:28.120
Do we, um, do we know the source?

22:28.120 --> 22:30.400
I mean, how did he get on our
radar?

22:30.400 --> 22:32.120
You think they'd tell me?

22:35.600 --> 22:37.040
How are you feeling, Rachel?

22:37.040 --> 22:39.440
Ma'am. Just getting up to speed.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.960
I appreciate you coming back
to work so soon,

22:41.960 --> 22:43.760
after the experience you've had.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.800
I'd rather...keep going.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.480
Rest when you're dead.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.440
Can I show you something?

22:59.320 --> 23:03.120
Frank, I felt DCI Carey should be
briefed on the ongoing developments.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.480
Welcome to America.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.120
Is that...? The hospital.

23:12.120 --> 23:15.200
Staff entrance.
The night of DS Flynn's murder.

23:15.200 --> 23:18.840
I thought whoever did this took over
the camera network completely?

23:21.080 --> 23:25.000
This section of the briefing
is sensitive.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.440
Understood.

23:27.800 --> 23:31.840
Every state has its own style
when it comes to subterfuge.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.680
Its own telltale signs.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.920
The Russians, for instance,
very sloppy. Online and off.

23:36.920 --> 23:40.480
They hacked SO15, but it appears
they didn't consider our...

23:42.120 --> 23:43.720
..auxiliary network.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.760
You can access the real footage?

23:45.760 --> 23:47.280
We can recover it

23:47.280 --> 23:50.480
from a covert signal
embedded in the time code.

23:50.480 --> 23:53.400
It's kind of like scratching
the oil paint off a canvas

23:53.400 --> 23:55.640
to reveal the pencil drawing
underneath.

23:55.640 --> 23:58.480
Stop me if I'm...getting too
technical.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.560
So, de-correction, then?

24:08.840 --> 24:12.600
Eventually we'll recover
all the footage from the attack.

24:12.600 --> 24:18.000
But, for now, our focus,
Todd, is this.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.960
Nikolai Mirsky.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.960
I-I thought Isaac Turner's
witness statement said

24:27.960 --> 24:30.720
the killers were
wearing face masks.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.800
Like I said, sloppy.

24:34.760 --> 24:37.960
Result. Intelligence on the suspect
is patchy.

24:37.960 --> 24:41.760
Facial rec points us to
a private security firm in Belarus.

24:41.760 --> 24:44.880
Russian black ops,
by any other name.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.400
Do we know if the suspect's
still in the UK?

24:47.400 --> 24:50.520
They hacked the feeds at Heathrow
last time - they could do it again.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.240
The manhunt is under way, Rachel.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.240
I'd like you to run something else.

24:55.240 --> 24:59.080
DC Tan is briefed
and making progress,

24:59.080 --> 25:04.040
but this requires the leadership
of someone fully conversant.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.640
What does, ma'am?

25:05.640 --> 25:07.760
The criminal case
against the suspect.

25:07.760 --> 25:10.400
We need an evidence dossier,

25:10.400 --> 25:13.400
robust enough to put in front of
a judge.

25:13.400 --> 25:19.040
The more evidence we can compile
against Nikolai Mirsky the better.

25:21.640 --> 25:23.040
Understood.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.280
You know the way back.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.240
I appreciate the chance to speak,
Home Secretary.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.080
I imagine you can guess what this
is about.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.640
Uh, well, let me see. You told BBC
Breakfast I failed to deliver.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.040
You told reporters I have
your full support.

25:54.040 --> 25:57.360
So, at a push, I'd guess you were
trying to steal my fucking job?

25:57.360 --> 26:00.120
So, I should have said
you don't have my support?

26:00.120 --> 26:02.760
You'll be saying the department
needs a breath of fresh air next.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.240
You're fucking me over, Isaac.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.680
Have the decency to look me
in the eye while you're doing it.

26:06.680 --> 26:08.840
You can hardly blame me for leaving
the department

26:08.840 --> 26:10.360
acutely aware of its shortcomings.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.080
Not to mention our unkept promise
of firm but fair immigration.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.920
Oh, don't quote the manifesto at me.

26:14.920 --> 26:17.240
You weren't even elected
when we wrote that.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.520
After all I've done for you.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.680
Go on.

26:26.720 --> 26:29.320
No, what did you do for me,
Home Secretary?

26:31.000 --> 26:32.880
Take a wild guess.

26:34.240 --> 26:37.120
I mean, I thought I was selected for
government by the PM?

26:38.240 --> 26:42.920
But if you had a hand in making me
Security Minister, Home Secretary...

26:42.920 --> 26:45.840
I'm not talking about making
you a minister.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.320
So, what are you talking about?

26:47.320 --> 26:49.360
I'm talking about that girl.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.000
Victoria Bello?

26:52.000 --> 26:54.880
Unless you have others
that I don't know about?

26:54.880 --> 26:56.680
I told you, that was all lies.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.720
You told me that a few days ago.

26:58.720 --> 27:01.560
That application hit my desk
six months back.

27:01.560 --> 27:05.080
Sorry, hit your desk? Why yours?

27:05.080 --> 27:07.720
Why don't you ask
your private secretary?

27:07.720 --> 27:09.160
Aliza?

27:09.160 --> 27:10.680
She came to you?

27:10.680 --> 27:13.200
Yep. All flummoxed,
convinced it was real,

27:13.200 --> 27:15.600
convinced that love child was yours,

27:15.600 --> 27:19.120
and convinced, as I was, that
it would be the bloody ruin of you.

27:19.120 --> 27:20.920
And then, so you...?

27:23.880 --> 27:26.720
The file found its way
to the bottom of the pile.

27:26.720 --> 27:30.200
Got lost. Drowned in a sea of
bureaucracy.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.680
You're welcome.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.400
So, that's how it's done, is it?

27:39.800 --> 27:42.000
And all that
because you assumed it was true.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.720
Don't be so bloody supercilious.
Are you really that surprised?

27:46.840 --> 27:49.800
No, Home Secretary,
I'm not surprised. In fact,

27:49.800 --> 27:52.120
it's exactly what I thought.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.680
I just needed to hear you say it.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.760
What do you mean? To say what?
What are you talking about?

27:58.760 --> 28:01.320
Don't walk away from me.
Don't you...!

28:02.560 --> 28:05.680
What is that?!
Are you recording this?!

28:05.680 --> 28:09.080
Are you mad?! Recording the Home
Secretary without his consent!

28:09.080 --> 28:11.160
That is a breach
of national security!

28:11.160 --> 28:12.560
I will have you stripped

28:12.560 --> 28:15.600
of every clearance level there is,
you little prick.

28:17.200 --> 28:20.880
It's insurance, Rowan,
in case you try to deny it.

28:20.880 --> 28:22.640
Deny it?! What are you talking
about?!

28:22.640 --> 28:25.720
Why are you doing this to me,
Isaac?!

28:27.920 --> 28:30.240
It's nothing personal.

28:40.360 --> 28:42.680
QUIET CHATTER

29:10.400 --> 29:13.520
Is it possible to embed a video
in time code?

29:13.520 --> 29:16.160
You don't do small talk,
do you, Carey?

29:16.160 --> 29:18.760
How's your day going, Tom?
Not bad. How's yours?

29:18.760 --> 29:19.960
Good.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.320
Is it possible to embed a video
in time code?

29:22.320 --> 29:25.680
I think you mean a time code signal
in audio, don't you?

29:25.680 --> 29:27.680
Nope. I mean what I said.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.760
Well, then,
you're talking bollocks.

29:29.760 --> 29:32.520
That's your technical assessment,
is it?

29:32.520 --> 29:33.760
Yep.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.440
I don't suppose it's possible
to recover a signal

29:38.440 --> 29:40.680
from a hacked feed either, is it?

29:40.680 --> 29:46.120
Like scratching the paint off
a canvas to reveal the drawing.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.800
What are you talking about?

29:50.480 --> 29:51.880
Nothing.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.600
Ma'am. The suspect's name was used
to rent

30:15.600 --> 30:18.560
a storage unit in Clapham two years
ago. It might be a dead end -

30:18.560 --> 30:20.800
the storage company is
no longer in business,

30:20.800 --> 30:23.280
but do you want me to head down
there and take a look?

30:24.680 --> 30:27.640
No, you stay here. I'll go.
Yes, ma'am.

30:38.160 --> 30:40.360
PHONE VIBRATES

30:41.520 --> 30:43.640
Hello? It's me.

30:43.640 --> 30:46.680
What phone are you calling from?
Have you left yet?

30:46.680 --> 30:50.480
Yeah. Just now.
I'm right here. Why?

30:50.480 --> 30:52.880
Good. I need you to do something
for me.

30:52.880 --> 30:55.600
Look, in the bathroom,
there's a laptop.

31:06.520 --> 31:07.880
Hi.

31:10.360 --> 31:12.640
You guarantee
they won't print my name?

31:12.640 --> 31:16.440
The clue is in the word anonymous.
Anonymous whistle-blower.

31:41.800 --> 31:44.440
I'm afraid you've caught me
on the hoof.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.640
Train was delayed
coming back from my conference,

31:46.640 --> 31:48.840
and now I'm running late for
a dinner engagement.

31:48.840 --> 31:52.600
I always seem to catch you either
coming or going. Time and tide.

31:52.600 --> 31:55.840
Was that the Home Secretary's
conference? His big announcement?

31:55.840 --> 31:58.160
Er, no. Different one.

31:59.520 --> 32:03.200
They're here, aren't they?
Clear Horizons AI?

32:04.600 --> 32:07.720
Yes, on the top floor.
US company, right?

32:07.720 --> 32:09.760
Silicon Valley, of course.

32:09.760 --> 32:13.160
But now they're taking over
the world, so to speak.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.040
You must be delighted.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.680
Your client winning the
UK facial recognition contract.

32:20.680 --> 32:23.200
You mentioned half your clients were
in this building.

32:23.200 --> 32:25.760
I'm assuming that includes them.

32:25.760 --> 32:29.240
We don't get involved
with their commercial operations.

32:32.800 --> 32:35.000
What do you get involved in?

32:37.640 --> 32:39.840
I'm sorry, Detective,
but where's this going?

32:39.840 --> 32:42.040
Surely you can see the problem,
Mr Knox.

32:43.440 --> 32:46.480
You belong to an independent
advisory group.

32:46.480 --> 32:50.880
You advised the government against
doing business with a Chinese firm,

32:50.880 --> 32:53.640
whilst in the pocket
of their US rivals.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.200
Looks like a conflict of interests
to me.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.720
I assure you,
I'm not in anyone's pocket.

33:04.200 --> 33:07.320
Tell me, what is it you do here,
exactly?

33:09.200 --> 33:14.080
Your website mentions
political consultancy,

33:14.080 --> 33:16.000
data analysis.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.800
Sounds...vague.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.560
I'd be glad to educate you,
Detective, but as I mentioned...

33:22.560 --> 33:24.840
Half the social media companies
on the planet seem

33:24.840 --> 33:28.920
to have an office in this building.
That's a lot of data to analyse.

33:28.920 --> 33:31.400
But as I mentioned,
I don't have all evening.

33:33.400 --> 33:37.600
How did you unmask the suspect
exactly? Nikolai Mirsky?

33:37.600 --> 33:41.120
Well, you supplied the image.
You know which program we used.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.440
Show me the process,
the working out.

33:43.440 --> 33:46.880
That involves my technical team,
none of whom are here.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.480
It's after hours.

33:48.480 --> 33:51.200
Did you supply the image
to anyone outside this company?

33:51.200 --> 33:53.320
You were quite clear about that.

33:53.320 --> 33:56.200
See, you haven't actually answered
the question.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.160
Is that something you teach
your politicians?

33:59.160 --> 34:00.880
Am I under suspicion, Detective?

34:00.880 --> 34:02.760
Increasingly.

34:02.760 --> 34:04.280
Well, if you want to arrest me

34:04.280 --> 34:07.200
for a conflict of interest,
go ahead.

34:08.240 --> 34:10.080
That won't be the charge.

34:23.720 --> 34:27.480
Suspect vehicle. Golf, X-ray,
six, six, Alpha, Echo Echo.

34:27.480 --> 34:30.000
Pos ID. Coleman Street, Echo,
Charlie, four.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.840
Vehicle heading north.
Bring it up. Let's see it.

34:32.840 --> 34:36.720
Deploy armed units to the vicinity.
Prepare for tactical response.

34:38.040 --> 34:41.040
The murder of Edison Yao and the
attempt on your life were designed

34:41.040 --> 34:43.640
to send Isaac Turner
into police protection,

34:43.640 --> 34:46.360
to keep him out of the public eye.
That's when this began.

34:46.360 --> 34:50.840
What began? The onslaught
of disinformation and lies

34:50.840 --> 34:54.040
that led us to believe
we were under attack from China,

34:54.040 --> 34:58.840
that ended with UK facial
recognition being handed to America.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.160
You have completely lost me.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.360
I don't believe you.

35:07.280 --> 35:10.120
I'm not continuing this conversation
until I have a lawyer.

35:10.120 --> 35:13.120
What is it you don't want me
to see on that laptop, Mr Knox?

35:13.120 --> 35:14.520
What?

35:14.520 --> 35:16.960
You've been glancing at it
like a schoolboy who forgot

35:16.960 --> 35:20.000
to delete his search history.
This is ridiculous.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.480
SIREN BLARES

35:26.640 --> 35:27.920
I can produce a warrant

35:27.920 --> 35:30.600
to seize every computer
in this building within 20 minutes.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.840
I'm afraid I've kept my dinner

35:31.840 --> 35:33.640
companions waiting....
But at this point,

35:33.640 --> 35:36.560
failure to cooperate will force my
hand. I employ corporate lawyers,

35:36.560 --> 35:39.400
but not criminal ones, so I'd like
time to arrange representation.

35:39.400 --> 35:42.000
Take one more step, and I will
have no option but to arrest.

35:43.040 --> 35:46.000
Gregory Knox, I am arresting you
for obstructing a police officer

35:46.000 --> 35:48.440
in the execution of their duty.
You do not have to say...

35:48.440 --> 35:49.800
Where the fuck are you going?!

35:49.800 --> 35:53.080
Do NOT make me add resisting
arrest to the list of charges!

35:55.400 --> 35:56.800
Do not move.

36:01.240 --> 36:04.040
Kilo 3 to all units.
Request urgent backup...

I hope you don't think of me
too unfavourably, Detective.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.960
I'm not a violent person.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.360
I've certainly never laid a finger
on a woman, as they say.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.480
Present company excepted, of course.

36:45.720 --> 36:51.280
Point is, I share the widely held
public-facing belief

36:51.280 --> 36:54.280
that violence towards women
is abhorrent.

36:54.280 --> 36:57.320
I say public-facing because online
it's a different picture.

36:57.320 --> 36:59.120
You poll 100 university students -

36:59.120 --> 37:01.720
"Is violence towards women
ever justified?" -

37:01.720 --> 37:03.440
You'll get 100 emphatic noes.

37:03.440 --> 37:04.920
But look at their Twitter feeds -

37:04.920 --> 37:07.440
you'll find 10% to 15% have,

37:07.440 --> 37:10.720
at some point or another,
sent death threats to women.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.560
Just one of the countless incidences
of data providing

37:13.560 --> 37:16.800
a clearer look at human behaviour
than humans themselves.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.840
Ugh!

37:28.000 --> 37:31.320
Suspect vehicle, check.

conspiracy to murder,

37:53.280 --> 37:56.640
perverting the course of justice,
grievous bodily harm,

37:56.640 --> 37:59.320
assaulting a police officer
and resisting arrest.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.320
Oh, no, stay on him!

38:07.320 --> 38:09.480
Repeat, out of range.
Blind spot, 50m.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.600
I want every border feed
where I can see it.

38:11.600 --> 38:15.000
And I want every armed unit in

Gill had direct involvement in
the interference

44:46.120 --> 44:48.400
of British passport applications,

44:48.400 --> 44:51.320
including that of Victoria
Bello's.

44:51.320 --> 44:54.960
So, can he cling on
and endure another scandal?

you know our...consultants.

Our c... What, Gregory's lot? Truro?

45:47.960 --> 45:50.120
I mean, we did consider
several alternatives.

45:50.120 --> 45:52.720
As I recall, you were the one
who made the final decision.

45:52.720 --> 45:55.200
We hired them a year ago.
What's the problem with them?

45:55.200 --> 45:57.560
Not to be pedantic,
but we didn't hire them, did we?

45:57.560 --> 45:59.240
They offered their services
for free.

45:59.240 --> 46:01.880
Which, now I think about it,
should've raised some alarm bells.

46:01.880 --> 46:04.720
I thought they just crunched data
and helped us reach voters?

46:04.720 --> 46:06.240
It's more the way they do it.

46:09.400 --> 46:12.760
I mean, it's bloody clever.
They are the dons of data.

They, er, haven't been trying
to destroy you, mate.

46:25.280 --> 46:27.760
Well, what the fuck have they
been doing?

46:29.080 --> 46:30.920
You really ought to get dressed.

46:30.920 --> 46:33.080

A political candidate

Last summer, inspired by
a wave of optimism across

48:38.840 --> 48:41.040
Georgia's burgeoning democracy,

48:41.040 --> 48:44.040
Alfonsi decided to run
for Mayor of Tbilisi,

48:44.040 --> 48:45.800
the capital city.

48:45.800 --> 48:49.360
The candidate had no experience
or media training.

48:54.440 --> 48:56.760
What the fuck is this? Sh!

48:56.760 --> 49:00.720
So far, Alfonsi had sought
to promote himself as a family man,

49:00.720 --> 49:02.040
a down-to-earth local

49:02.040 --> 49:05.240

50:20.160 --> 50:23.400
But the algorithm had seen
what they couldn't.

50:24.840 --> 50:28.480
Online, the data revealed
a different Tbilisi.

50:29.720 --> 50:32.000
Here was a city at war

50:32.000 --> 50:34.680
divided over a number
of burning issues.

50:34.680 --> 50:37.160
Looking deeper, data revealed

50:37.160 --> 50:40.640
exactly which issues caused
most concern,

50:40.640 --> 50:44.840
which news stories literally kept
the locals awake at night.

50:52.200 --> 50:53.920
The silent majority

50:53.920 --> 50:55.720
had suddenly been spoken for.

50:55.720 --> 50:59.280
"The real people of Tbilisi"
began to trend,

50:59.280 --> 51:01.360
spawning a movement, a base.

51:01.360 --> 51:04.400
CHANTING: Alfonsi! Alfonsi!

51:04.400 --> 51:08.480
Alfonsi was a rising star of
the populist right.

51:10.800 --> 51:12.720
Or so it seemed.

51:12.720 --> 51:15.480
STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS
Alfonsi Guruli.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.480
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE

51:25.520 --> 51:27.200
APPLAUSE

51:31.160 --> 51:32.640
LAUGHTER

51:32.640 --> 51:34.960
Scores of people
appeared on social media,

51:34.960 --> 51:36.400
insisting he had always been

51:36.400 --> 51:38.400
a strong advocate of gay rights.

51:38.400 --> 51:41.600
The Alfonsi Guruli THEY knew
was no bigot.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.120
A new narrative began to take shape.

51:45.120 --> 51:48.000
Alfonsi was a savvy politician,

51:48.000 --> 51:50.720
playing the orthodox right
for votes.

51:50.720 --> 51:54.280
And the real REAL people of Tbilisi
knew that.

51:59.280 --> 52:00.680
LAUGHTER

52:03.040 --> 52:07.120
Truro's AI had created
a political campaign

52:07.120 --> 52:08.920
for a polarised world...

52:10.800 --> 52:14.520
..in which every different
sub-section of the electorate

52:14.520 --> 52:17.680
is sold a version of the candidate
they can vote for.

52:26.120 --> 52:31.200
Today, Alfonsi is Mayor of Tbilisi,

52:31.200 --> 52:34.800
elected with 65% of the vote.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.920
CHEERING AND WHOOPING

52:44.480 --> 52:47.000
Perhaps next time we meet,

52:47.000 --> 52:49.080
Truro's algorithm

52:49.080 --> 52:51.560
will have decided the fate
of a British MP.

52:56.120 --> 52:58.280
Or even PM.

52:59.680 --> 53:02.080
APPLAUSE
MUSIC PLAYS

53:10.280 --> 53:13.080
# I'm ever so confident
I'm reppin' for my continent

53:13.080 --> 53:14.560
# Not looking for a compliment

53:14.560 --> 53:16.760
# When I break through
I'm coming to America

53:16.760 --> 53:19.320
# Tearing down the barriers
and reppin' for my area

53:19.320 --> 53:22.920
# Now I'm surrounded by a dream team
Sitting on top of the league

53:22.920 --> 53:27.200
# Supporting the grand vision I see
Spotlights on me, riding lyrically

53:27.200 --> 53:30.960
# Cos I float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee... #

53:30.960 --> 53:34.200
So, what, that's supposed to be me?
I'm an Alfonso?

53:34.200 --> 53:35.920
Alfonsi. Al...

53:37.880 --> 53:40.360
You made me an advocate
of racial profiling.

53:40.360 --> 53:42.760
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
It's the algorithm.

53:42.760 --> 53:45.600
Every action suggested
by the algorithm

53:45.600 --> 53:48.160
moves you one step closer
to where you want to be.

53:49.840 --> 53:51.800
Where do you want to be, Isaac?

53:53.720 --> 53:56.560
I don't need a program
to figure that one out.

53:56.560 --> 53:59.360
What ambitious politician
doesn't want the top job?

ISAAC SCOFFS

54:03.960 --> 54:07.160
I can only imagine the impact you'll
make when you finally get there.

54:09.800 --> 54:12.120
But, goodness,
I'm getting ahead of myself.

54:12.120 --> 54:15.480
The road to Number 10 is long.
Years of work.

54:15.480 --> 54:18.520
We need to be patient.
Do as the algorithm says,

54:18.520 --> 54:21.240
step by step, heart to heart,

54:21.240 --> 54:23.720
and we'll get there in the end.
You're mad.

54:23.720 --> 54:25.720
Look at where it's got you already.

54:25.720 --> 54:29.840
A critical stage in your journey is
within your grasp.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.920
Home sec, baby.

54:32.920 --> 54:36.280
You actually...you actually believe
this shit?

54:36.280 --> 54:39.600
You think that data witchcraft can
decide who runs the Home Office?

54:39.600 --> 54:42.120
It can decide who runs the country.

54:43.160 --> 54:46.960
Consider Home Secretary
your gruelling audition.

54:48.720 --> 54:49.960
Fuck this.

54:51.120 --> 54:54.840
After everything you've put me
through. And my family...

54:56.840 --> 55:00.160
I should be ramming your head
through that wall.

55:00.160 --> 55:02.480
And yet you're not.

55:05.280 --> 55:07.640
Your popularity is on the rise,
Isaac.

55:07.640 --> 55:10.000
While poor Rowan Gill's...

55:11.760 --> 55:16.360
Well, there's work to be done.
Your trusty spad will fill you in.

55:18.200 --> 55:21.520
Sorry, what, you expect me
to collude in this fuckery?

55:21.520 --> 55:23.600
I-I thought you didn't need me
anyway?

55:23.600 --> 55:25.760
You built your own version
of me. Who, Digi-Zac?

55:25.760 --> 55:27.120
I've enjoyed working with him,

55:27.120 --> 55:28.960
but I'm thrilled you're ready
to take over.

55:28.960 --> 55:31.360
The hell makes you think
I'm going to do that?

55:31.360 --> 55:33.400
Why, the algorithm, of course.

55:34.920 --> 55:38.600
The algorithm sees the world
in all its complexity.

55:41.080 --> 55:44.840
The algorithm understands you, me,

55:44.840 --> 55:47.480
and every segment of our society

55:47.480 --> 55:49.400
better than we understand ourselves.

55:50.960 --> 55:54.680
And it predicts, Isaac Turner,
that you will comply

55:54.680 --> 55:58.120
with this campaign just as soon
as it brings you success.

56:01.560 --> 56:04.560
For with success comes power.

56:06.360 --> 56:08.120
And with power...

56:09.560 --> 56:12.720
..you can do all the good
you've ever dreamt of.

56:23.520 --> 56:25.360
Cars are outside when you're ready.

56:27.240 --> 56:29.160
Catch some shuteye on the way back.

56:30.320 --> 56:32.960
We need you fresh-faced
for the press.

56:34.960 --> 56:36.920
I didn't say anything.

56:36.920 --> 56:38.440
What?

56:40.080 --> 56:41.920
I didn't say yes.

56:44.520 --> 56:46.560
You didn't say no.

56:49.720 --> 56:51.800
PHONE BUZZES

57:05.120 --> 57:07.520
Hello? What ya watching?

57:08.480 --> 57:10.280
Home Sec looking silly?

57:12.800 --> 57:15.840
All seems to have gone rather well,
don't you think?

57:20.480 --> 57:21.600
So...

57:23.400 --> 57:26.560
..what do you say? You in?

57:33.680 --> 57:35.120
Yes.

57:37.720 --> 57:39.160
Wonderful.

57:40.440 --> 57:44.320
I'll be in touch first thing.
Sleep well, Isaac Turner.

57:45.880 --> 57:48.920
It's been a long,
discombobulating day.

57:51.920 --> 57:55.360
But everything's falling perfectly
into place.

57:57.960 --> 57:59.840
