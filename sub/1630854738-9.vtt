WEBVTT

00:08.049 --> 00:09.884
Summer's almost over.

00:09.968 --> 00:13.179
They gave me everything,
and now they're taking it all away.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.848
-Who's they?
-I don't know!

00:16.016 --> 00:17.017
School.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.394
Son of a bitch.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.398
I haven't even started my summer reading,
so I'm reading one line from each book.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.735
"Big Brother is watching you."

00:27.527 --> 00:29.571
Okay. So it's about a perv. Next.

00:30.572 --> 00:34.075
Hang on, there's a lot to love
about starting a new school year.

00:34.159 --> 00:37.829
New homerooms,
the smell of fresh textbooks,

00:37.912 --> 00:39.664
getting up early to learn.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.209
Boo!

00:43.960 --> 00:45.837
Hey! Go easy on her.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.505
School is cool.

00:47.589 --> 00:51.176
I mean, we learn stuff,
and there's lockers, and…

00:52.844 --> 00:54.596
I'm sorry, babe. My heart's not in it.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.725
"Once you stop learning, you start dying."

00:58.808 --> 01:00.852
You know who said that? Einstein.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.771
-Einstein the bear?
-I'm done.

01:05.398 --> 01:07.233
I am so screwed.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.737
I was supposed to be working out
all summer for football. But instead,

01:10.820 --> 01:11.780
I didn't.

01:13.156 --> 01:16.159
Bro, come to my gym. I'll get you ripped.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.203
Here, check it out.

01:19.329 --> 01:22.749
It's like a snake ate a big rat,
and it hasn't digested it yet.

01:25.543 --> 01:27.629
I want snake arms. Let's do this.

01:27.712 --> 01:28.546
Sweet.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.633
Oh, since it's your last weekend,
I traded shifts at work

01:31.716 --> 01:33.301
so we can spend tomorrow together.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.804
I wanna take you
to my special place in the woods.

01:36.429 --> 01:39.307
And that was the last time
anyone saw her alive.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.685
No, for a picnic.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.272
I want to show you this overlook
with an amazing view.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.649
That's so romantic.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.693
There's this rock up there,
and it looks like two people doin' it.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.822
They call it the bone stone.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.326
Slightly less romantic…
But I can't wait.

01:58.409 --> 01:59.494
See you tomorrow.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.000
What the hell? You're blowing me off?

02:06.084 --> 02:08.211
We're supposed to sneak
into the country club tomorrow.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.797
Oh crap. I totally blanked.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.883
But Jay's right.
It's our last Saturday together.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.177
Dude, but it's <i>our</i>
last Saturday together too.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.514
A bunch of rich people put up a fence
to keep us out?

02:19.597 --> 02:22.475
Screw them. They're not better than us.
Right, Ozzie?

02:22.559 --> 02:24.269
I mean…

02:25.186 --> 02:26.354
No. I'll cancel with Jay.

02:26.437 --> 02:27.313
Nice.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.691
The revolution starts tomorrow.

02:30.441 --> 02:32.360
I'm gonna go see if my mom can drive us.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.865
So you're canceling
the romantic picnic with snake arms?

02:37.448 --> 02:38.700
Um…

02:38.783 --> 02:41.452
-You're gonna ditch your best friend?
-Ehh…

02:42.996 --> 02:44.414
You're a dirty double-booker!

02:46.291 --> 02:49.752
I don't know what else to do,
but I think I can make it work, right?

02:49.836 --> 02:51.254
I mean…

02:51.754 --> 02:53.590
-<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

03:05.226 --> 03:07.270
<i>Hello, Wisconsin!</i>

03:09.230 --> 03:11.149
Are you finished with the finance section?

03:11.649 --> 03:12.650
Why are you here?

03:14.110 --> 03:15.945
I can't be in the basement anymore.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.947
Those kids are idiots.

03:18.573 --> 03:19.741
I like you!

03:20.617 --> 03:23.828
Okay, 3:00 p.m., great. I will be there.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.292
Red, that was Penny McFadden.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.627
Penny McFadden?!

03:30.710 --> 03:31.544
Yeah!

03:33.421 --> 03:34.797
I have no idea who that is.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.884
From the high school.

03:37.967 --> 03:40.261
Their school nurse didn't know
she was pregnant,

03:40.345 --> 03:43.181
and just had her baby in the LensCrafters.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.390
Eww!

03:45.058 --> 03:46.851
That's where I get my contacts.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.979
Well, she is taking
an extended maternity leave,

03:50.063 --> 03:52.982
and I have an interview tomorrow
to replace her.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.069
Kitty, why would you
want to go back to work?

03:56.152 --> 03:58.071
You know what's there, don't you?

03:58.571 --> 03:59.572
Work.

04:00.323 --> 04:04.327
Leia will be leaving soon, and I really
enjoyed being around the kids.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.664
Yeah, but you're forgetting about the part
where there's some jerk there

04:07.747 --> 04:09.290
bossing you around.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.084
By the way, I could use a refill.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.672
Don't listen to him.
I think it's a great idea, Mrs. Forman.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.507
I don't like you anymore.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.051
Think about it.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.594
You haven't worked in years.

04:21.678 --> 04:25.431
You've gotten older and slower and softer.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.059
Uh-huh?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.436
You might need another refill.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.065
How long have you been married?

04:34.148 --> 04:36.025
'Cause that was a rookie mistake.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.491
Bro.

04:44.492 --> 04:45.785
Are you ready to shred?

04:46.703 --> 04:49.831
Call me a block of mozzarella
and grate me over a pizza.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.749
That's what I'm talking about.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.710
-Bro!
-Bro!

04:53.793 --> 04:55.003
-Bro!
-Let's go!

04:55.086 --> 04:56.045
Let's go!

05:35.877 --> 05:39.047
You are so sweet
to help me with my résumé.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.716
Some people are not so supportive.

05:41.799 --> 05:45.636
Oh, I meant "softer" in a good way!

05:45.720 --> 05:48.056
You know, like an old pillow.

05:51.309 --> 05:52.185
I got it.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.856
-Okay, tell me about your last job.
-I was a head nurse.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.608
Perfect. Do you have any references?

05:58.691 --> 06:00.568
Oh, my bosses all loved me.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.362
But they are dead.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.826
Come on, slowpoke.
Don't make me have to carry you.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.536
Wait, hang on.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.749
Look at the way
the sunlight is hitting those branches.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.127
Nature can be so overwhelming.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.464
Cool. Clocked it. Moving on.

06:21.547 --> 06:22.382
Hey.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.884
What's the rush? We've got all day.

06:25.843 --> 06:26.969
About that, um…

06:27.470 --> 06:30.515
I didn't want to tell you this,
but I might have to leave a little early.

06:31.265 --> 06:34.727
-Why? Do you have something else to do?
-No, no, it's just, um…

06:34.811 --> 06:37.313
I want to start getting back
on Chicago time before I move home.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.734
-Isn't it the same time there?
-No. It's… It's way different.

06:42.735 --> 06:47.198
Because of the, um…
the gravitational pull of the lake.

06:49.158 --> 06:49.992
That makes sense.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.205
Those lakes are doing
more than we think they're doing.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.166
Yeah. So are we almost there?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.251
Uh…

06:59.919 --> 07:02.713
-Actually, I'm kinda turned around.
-So, what, we're lost?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.133
Wait, are we lost?

07:05.216 --> 07:07.593
No. No, no, no. I think we're close.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.929
Here, let me ask this guy if he knows.

07:11.722 --> 07:12.807
Excuse me?

07:16.394 --> 07:18.396
Do you know
where we can find the overlook?

07:18.479 --> 07:20.940
Yeah, you've got to find
the under-look, okay?

07:21.566 --> 07:23.109
And it's right above that.

07:24.902 --> 07:25.736
Wait, Leo?

07:25.820 --> 07:28.531
Good guess!

07:28.614 --> 07:29.615
Okay, let me try.

07:30.825 --> 07:31.868
Patricia?

07:32.577 --> 07:34.787
Yes. Patricia.

07:35.496 --> 07:36.330
I knew it.

07:37.039 --> 07:39.083
Um, but the overlook is up this way?

07:39.167 --> 07:41.002
Yeah, yeah. Just around the corner, man.

07:41.752 --> 07:42.753
Thanks.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.631
Wait, wait, wait!

07:46.549 --> 07:49.385
If you stand here, you can see
the very tip of the bone stone.

07:51.804 --> 07:52.805
Uh-huh.

08:02.231 --> 08:03.608
I am so sore.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.028
It took me 20 minutes
to get up your driveway.

08:07.528 --> 08:11.699
Why did you think you can do an entire
summer's worth of workouts in one day?

08:11.782 --> 08:12.867
He never thinks ahead.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.869
Now he's so sore
he can't even use a toilet.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.205
You're making me sound pathetic.

08:17.288 --> 08:18.206
I can use it.

08:18.706 --> 08:19.790
I just can't get up.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.044
Those cookies look good.

08:27.882 --> 08:28.716
Here.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.302
Now go downstairs. We're busy.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.678
Thanks, babe.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.431
You know what would help you, honey?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.183
Rub some Bengay on it.

08:37.266 --> 08:41.562
I use it on my shoulder when I go too hard
on a big bowl of scrambled eggs.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.106
Oh jeez.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.400
Maybe Red was right.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.445
If I get sore making breakfast,

08:49.529 --> 08:52.240
how can I keep up with
a bunch of high school kids?

08:58.037 --> 09:00.706
Grandma. I got a little paper cut
in math class.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.875
Oh, honey, let me get you a Band-Aid.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.670
Mrs. Forman, I'm having a problem
with my eye. It fell out.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.296
Oh dear. How did that happen?

09:07.380 --> 09:10.049
It's a long story. Do you really feel like
we have time for that?

09:10.132 --> 09:11.592
This paper cut's a gusher!

09:11.676 --> 09:13.761
Oh! Put… Put pressure on it!

09:13.844 --> 09:16.847
I need this kidney transferred
into my body before sixth period.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.516
Surgery?!

09:18.599 --> 09:21.269
She's having a baby now!
She was gonna go to the hospital,

09:21.352 --> 09:23.604
but I said,
"No, let the school nurse handle it."

09:24.730 --> 09:26.482
-What do I do?
-Don't push!

09:26.566 --> 09:28.109
I pushed!

09:33.447 --> 09:35.741
I told you, you were in over your head.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.118
Wah!

09:37.201 --> 09:38.744
Wah! Wah!

09:43.666 --> 09:45.376
That could all happen.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.045
Hey, Mrs. Forman.

09:49.338 --> 09:52.758
Holy smokes! How cute are the two of you?

09:52.842 --> 09:56.095
You look like you just
came out of <i>The Great Gatsby</i>.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.806
I read a line from that book today.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.101
Where's Leia? We're supposed to hang out.

10:02.184 --> 10:05.396
Oh, she's not back yet.
She went on a picnic with Jay.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.731
She's with Jay?

10:06.814 --> 10:08.941
-Can you believe this?
-Yeah, she told me.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.234
Ozzie!

10:11.485 --> 10:13.404
A part of me thought
she could pull it off.

10:13.487 --> 10:15.364
The same foolish part of me that believed

10:15.448 --> 10:18.034
that Madonna and Dennis Rodman
would be together forever.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.704
Whatever. Tell Leia she can bite me.

10:21.787 --> 10:25.416
Okay, I'm just…
I'm gonna put my own spin on it.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.381
Hey! Be careful!

10:33.966 --> 10:35.635
Are you still here?

10:42.266 --> 10:43.934
Jay, why are we stopping?

10:44.018 --> 10:45.936
We have no idea where we are.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.104
I know.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.398
Let's just take a break
and have our picnic.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.360
Then I can start
working on the signal fire.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.280
A signal fire?
I was supposed to be done with you by now.

10:57.573 --> 10:58.741
Done with me?

10:59.241 --> 11:01.494
All right, you've been acting weird
since we got here.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.872
Is it 'cause I cried
when I saw that butterfly?

11:05.873 --> 11:06.999
The truth is, I…

11:08.417 --> 11:09.794
I made plans with Gwen today too.

11:11.253 --> 11:12.630
You're a dirty double-booker!

11:13.214 --> 11:15.049
I know. I'm not proud.

11:15.132 --> 11:17.510
Leia, you should have just told me.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.513
I mean, I know I don't let anyone
touch my hair,

11:20.596 --> 11:22.807
but other than that, I'm not unreasonable.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.101
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied. I…

11:25.810 --> 11:29.105
I didn't want to disappoint you,
and I didn't want to disappoint Gwen.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.691
-I messed up.
-And what about Chicago?

11:32.274 --> 11:33.526
It's the same time zone.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.028
That one hurt.

11:39.031 --> 11:42.243
-Leo?
-Hey! Great guess, man.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.453
Hey, I got a question.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.288
You guys know how to get to the overlook?

11:46.372 --> 11:48.290
You just gave us
directions to the overlook.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.084
Oh good. What did I say?

11:51.210 --> 11:52.420
Great, we're all lost.

11:52.503 --> 11:53.462
Just a heads-up.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.132
There's a squirrel
that's been picking on me, man.

11:57.383 --> 12:00.678
Tells me a joke and then he runs away
before he gets to the punch line.

12:01.679 --> 12:02.763
Not cool.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.181
How are we ever getting home?

12:04.265 --> 12:06.642
Hey. Why don't you use my car?

12:06.726 --> 12:10.146
Yeah. It's parked on the road
that goes right into town.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.650
Knock-knock what, you jerk?!

12:18.112 --> 12:19.905
I'm so pissed at Leia right now.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.658
Yeah, yeah. She's a monster.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.118
I have bigger problems.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.870
Um, excuse me.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.291
I'd like to send this lemonade back.
I can taste the can.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.877
I want freshly squeezed,
and I want it pronto.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.254
Okay. May I have your member number?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.715
May I have your unemployment number?

12:38.716 --> 12:40.926
I'm so sorry.
I'll be right back with your drink.

12:42.344 --> 12:44.138
And bring some nachos for the lady!

12:45.389 --> 12:47.975
I'm here. I know I'm a little late,
but I can explain.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.977
Oh my God, I can't wait to hear.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.854
Oh wait. Don't care.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.858
You know what I went through to get here?
I risked my life.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.819
I just rode in a car where the seat belt
was a dried-out rattlesnake.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.947
-Do you want to split a cheese plate?
-I got you.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.657
Cheese plate!

13:04.241 --> 13:06.202
Gwen, are you serious? You're ignoring me?

13:06.786 --> 13:11.332
You knew how important this was to me,
and you still blew me off for Jay.

13:11.832 --> 13:12.792
Just forget it.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.877
-Forget what?
-Everything.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.921
Go back to Chicago and leave me alone.

13:17.004 --> 13:20.090
What? No, I'm not leaving
until we talk about this.

13:20.591 --> 13:21.592
Excuse me?

13:21.675 --> 13:23.177
Oh, good idea. Order some food,

13:23.260 --> 13:25.137
and we'll have
that heart-to-heart we need.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.514
She's not a member.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.266
Gwen, you don't have to do this.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.268
At least let me try the cheese plate!

13:32.436 --> 13:34.980
They are just letting
anyone in these days.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.365
Thank you for coming for moral support.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.867
I hope it wasn't
too much of an inconvenience.

13:46.951 --> 13:47.827
Are you kidding?

13:47.910 --> 13:51.956
Being inside of the school before everyone
else is giving me such an adrenaline rush.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.750
I feel like I can flip over a car.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.671
Oh no.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.549
Where is my résumé? It's not here.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.137
A can of tuna?

14:07.847 --> 14:11.100
Yeah, I put that on top of my résumé
so I wouldn't forget it.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.063
"To not" forget your résumé.

14:18.482 --> 14:21.402
-But you forgot it.
-Okay, why am I on trial here?

14:23.153 --> 14:26.699
Maybe this is a sign.
I have no business going back to work.

14:26.782 --> 14:27.700
Red was right.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.660
Well, I like the sound of that.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.954
Red, what are you doing here?

14:32.037 --> 14:34.540
-You forgot your résumé.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.042
And your wallet.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.713
And I found a slipper in the microwave.

14:42.172 --> 14:45.175
Yeah, yeah. I was… I was a little nervous.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.302
Yeah.

14:47.928 --> 14:50.598
And now that I'm here,
I think I'm losing my nerve.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.850
I mean, look how young they are.

14:53.767 --> 14:57.438
I bet none of them even remember
the days when you could smoke in the ER.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.107
Look.

15:00.190 --> 15:04.528
Any time that you have set your mind
to something, you have done it.

15:05.112 --> 15:08.574
I mean, I only wanted one kid,
and you talked me into Eric.

15:08.657 --> 15:09.867
And that turned out…

15:10.659 --> 15:12.161
So don't give up.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.957
You're a damn good nurse.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.795
Go on in there and get this job.

15:23.213 --> 15:24.214
Thank you.

15:26.467 --> 15:30.262
They are not gonna know what hit them.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.312
They'll call me when it's my turn.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.735
Nate? Are you okay?

15:45.277 --> 15:46.946
I'm so thirsty.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.657
Can you reach that water for me?

15:50.157 --> 15:51.450
And bring it to my lips?

15:51.533 --> 15:53.911
And tip it in my mouth? I'll do the rest.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.127
I thought you were
at the country club with Gwen.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.671
We got in a fight.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.965
She went off on me
for being a little late.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.549
She said some really mean things.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.510
Did she say you had dog nipples too?

16:11.595 --> 16:13.472
Um… no.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.474
Yeah.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.558
Me neither.

16:18.686 --> 16:23.107
Look. Whatever she said,
you gotta let it roll off your back.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.734
She gets like this. I mean…

16:26.902 --> 16:27.903
You're leaving soon.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.155
But I don't understand.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.492
I'm the one who has to go back to Chicago
and be invisible again.

16:33.575 --> 16:36.870
Gwen's gonna be all busy doing cool stuff,
hanging out with friends at school.

16:38.497 --> 16:42.001
Look, I know Gwen is like "Gwen" to you,

16:42.084 --> 16:45.004
but… it's different at school.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.339
A lot of people don't get her.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.301
I think she's gonna miss you
a lot more than you realize.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.304
She wasn't acting like it today.

16:54.805 --> 16:57.141
She got me tossed out of the country club.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.142
Tossed.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.935
Like DJ Jazzy Jeff.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.396
I don't know,

17:02.479 --> 17:06.358
but… it's probably just Gwen's
messed-up way of dealing with losing you.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.443
She's not.

17:08.068 --> 17:11.655
I'm gonna call and… and write
and visit whenever I can.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.199
She's my best friend.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.493
Can't imagine my life without her.

17:17.995 --> 17:19.079
Have you told her that?

17:19.663 --> 17:20.664
Maybe not enough.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.293
Thanks, Nate. You're really smart.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.463
No one's ever called me smart before.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.007
It sounds weird.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.967
Aw, Nate.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.469
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

17:37.473 --> 17:38.807
I got the job!

17:41.852 --> 17:43.979
Attagirl! I knew you would.

17:44.063 --> 17:48.150
They were so impressed
with my knowledge and my experience.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.028
And the woman who was interviewing me
forgot her lunch,

17:51.111 --> 17:52.821
so I gave her my can of tuna.

17:52.905 --> 17:53.906
Sealed the deal.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.243
Well, as long as you're happy,
I am happy for you.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.203
I am.

17:59.286 --> 18:02.081
I can't believe it.
I'm going back to work.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.421
It happened again.
I'm not cut out for woodshop.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.387
Neat. Guess I'll be having those
all the time now.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.478
I know you're there.

18:25.729 --> 18:26.730
Hey, buddy.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.275
-Don't.
-Oh, I'm gonna.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.904
Look. Sometimes distance
can bring you closer.

18:34.404 --> 18:37.533
Have you ever made someone laugh
from thousands of miles away?

18:37.616 --> 18:39.868
Or… or… faxed your friend a recipe

18:40.619 --> 18:41.495
from the beach?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.623
That's from an AT&T commercial.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.625
I'm trying here.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.753
You can try all you want,
but I'm not doing this.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.630
Yes, we are doing this.

18:51.713 --> 18:54.133
You think I'm gonna leave
and never talk to you again?

18:54.633 --> 18:57.094
That's not an option.
You have to talk to me.

18:59.721 --> 19:02.599
Because, with AT&T's
new long-distance plan,

19:02.683 --> 19:04.143
you can't afford not to.

19:06.562 --> 19:11.191
Gwen, for real, you're my best friend,
and nothing will ever change that.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.985
If I'm in Chicago, I'm here for you.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.028
If I'm on the moon, I'm here for you.

19:15.529 --> 19:18.490
When we die,
my ghost will haunt your ghost.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.160
So get used to it,
because you're stuck with me.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.124
I'm gonna miss you.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.043
I'll miss you even more.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.007
You're listening to Michael Bolton?

19:35.090 --> 19:37.009
You really were
in a dark place.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.636
If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.226
Come on. You got this.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.437
Push. Push, Nate!

19:50.939 --> 19:51.899
Nice.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.067
You're an animal.

19:54.943 --> 19:55.944
Thanks, bro.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.363
This time tomorrow,
I'll be able to use a fork.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.410
Hey. Sorry I wasn't here to help you out.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.913
That's okay. Nikki wasn't either.

20:06.663 --> 20:08.373
I think she was pretty annoyed.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.627
But you know who did help me out? Leia.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.463
You lucked out, man. She's pretty great.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.089
Yeah, when she's here.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.257
What do you mean?

20:17.341 --> 20:18.175
Well…

20:18.884 --> 20:21.428
How am I supposed to make this work
with Leia when she leaves?

20:21.929 --> 20:23.347
I mean, yesterday was a mess,

20:23.430 --> 20:27.309
and it's only gonna get more complicated
when she's all the way in Chicago.

20:27.809 --> 20:28.727
I'm kinda freaked out.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.607
-I think we need to have a serious talk.
-We <i>are </i>having a serious talk.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.276
I meant me and Leia.

20:36.860 --> 20:37.819
Oh.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.656
Oh!
