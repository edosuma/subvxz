The L Word: Generation Q...</i>

00:08.717 --> 00:09.926
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

00:09.926 --> 00:11.469
<i>You should not be
fucking around in here.</i>

00:11.469 --> 00:12.929
<i>I'll just stay
out of your way then.</i>

00:12.929 --> 00:13.972
<i>You kind of have a pattern.</i>

00:13.972 --> 00:15.181
<i>Is that what you think about?</i>

00:15.181 --> 00:16.641
<i>When you think about me?
- Sometimes.</i>

00:16.641 --> 00:18.977
<i>Contestant three, I choose you!</i>

00:18.977 --> 00:20.562
You're not regular.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.230
<i>- Yes, I am.
- Well, so am I.</i>

00:22.230 --> 00:24.816
<i>There's a 45-foot
picture of you outside.</i>

00:24.816 --> 00:26.526
<i>Guess who's
coming to town tonight?</i>

00:26.526 --> 00:28.194
<i>Roxy!</i>

00:28.194 --> 00:29.446
She is into you.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.031
<i>Do you want to
go home with me?</i>

00:31.031 --> 00:32.532
<i>I'm halfway
out the door, baby.</i>

00:32.532 --> 00:34.284
<i>I just can't stop thinking
about this person.</i>

00:34.284 --> 00:36.077
<i>When are you
gonna stop punishing me, Fin?</i>

00:36.077 --> 00:37.370
<i>I don't want to be
your patient.</i>

00:37.370 --> 00:38.830
Mom, I don't mind.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.206
<i>I want to go live
in the nursing home.</i>

00:40.206 --> 00:41.833
<i>- I want to have a baby.
- My mom</i>

00:41.833 --> 00:43.084
<i>doesn't even
know we're dating yet.</i>

00:43.084 --> 00:44.586
So, who's the guy?

00:44.586 --> 00:46.046
<i>It's just the fact
that it's really new</i>

00:46.046 --> 00:47.130
<i>and nobody knows.</i>

00:47.130 --> 00:49.257
<i>Okay.
- A secret boyfriend?</i>

00:49.257 --> 00:51.342
<i>Who are you?
- I can show you who I am.</i>

00:51.342 --> 00:54.262
Well, it's not a bad start.

00:54.262 --> 00:55.930
As much as I'd like to,

00:55.930 --> 00:58.266
<i>I can't.</i>

00:58.266 --> 01:00.018
<i>- Fuck you, Shane.
- I don't find trouble</i>

01:00.018 --> 01:02.228
<i>- Ah!
- Yeah, trouble finds me</i>

01:03.104 --> 01:05.690
<i>Ladies make the</i>

01:05.690 --> 01:07.192
<i>Ladies, ladies</i>

01:07.192 --> 01:10.070
<i>Ladies make, ladies make
the world go round</i>

01:12.530 --> 01:14.324
<i>Yeah, I couldn't get
middle seats,</i>

01:14.324 --> 01:17.744
<i>but I did get a row
where there's no one behind us,</i>

01:17.744 --> 01:18.953
<i>so we don't have to worry about</i>

01:18.953 --> 01:20.330
<i>people kicking our seats.</i>

01:20.330 --> 01:21.706
Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.

01:21.706 --> 01:22.791
<i>I'll just...</i>

01:22.791 --> 01:23.958
<i>I'll find you guys
when I get there.</i>

01:23.958 --> 01:25.043
Oh, it's just us.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.377
<i>Um, Taylor's got to work.</i>

01:26.377 --> 01:27.962
<i>But, can you please not be late?</i>

01:27.962 --> 01:29.714
<i>'Cause you know how I like
to watch the previews.</i>

01:29.714 --> 01:30.799
<i>I know that.</i>

01:30.799 --> 01:32.092
<i>I know, I know, I know.
I promise.</i>

01:32.092 --> 01:33.510
<i>I'm gonna be there
at 7:30 sharp.</i>

01:33.510 --> 01:35.345
<i>Okay. I'm gonna get two
popcorns though, 'cause I don't</i>

01:35.345 --> 01:37.055
<i>like to share. But then
sometimes I'm like, should I</i>

01:37.055 --> 01:38.223
<i>get a medium...
- Okay, okay, bye.</i>

01:38.223 --> 01:41.559
<i>Oh...
- Hi. How are you?</i>

01:43.019 --> 01:45.939
<i>I just started
packing these for your mom.</i>

01:46.815 --> 01:48.650
<i>Okay.</i>

01:50.151 --> 01:51.778
<i>Are those...?</i>

02:00.870 --> 02:04.165
<i>I-I think we should
talk about this.</i>

02:04.165 --> 02:07.001
<i>I don't really have anything
to say to you right now.</i>

02:07.001 --> 02:10.130
<i>All right. I just, uh...
-</i>

02:10.130 --> 02:11.339
<i>I don't know...
- Oh. Oh, my God!</i>

02:11.339 --> 02:12.674
<i>What?
- Is that a bee?</i>

02:12.674 --> 02:14.384
<i>What?
- Oh, my God. Go!</i>

02:14.384 --> 02:15.635
<i>Okay, okay, okay.
- Get it.</i>

02:15.635 --> 02:17.262
<i>Okay, I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it.</i>

02:17.262 --> 02:18.513
<i>Well, don't kill it.
Wh-What are you doing?</i>

02:18.513 --> 02:19.973
<i>It's right there.
- Okay, yes.</i>

02:19.973 --> 02:21.182
<i>Who said anything
about killing it?</i>

02:21.182 --> 02:22.433
<i>Hold on.
- Okay, well, just, I don't know.</i>

02:22.433 --> 02:24.144
<i>They're just endangered
or whatever.</i>

02:24.144 --> 02:25.186
<i>Okay, good.
- It's fine.</i>

02:25.186 --> 02:26.312
<i>I wasn't gonna kill it.</i>

02:26.312 --> 02:27.480
Fine.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.399
<i>Can you open the door?
Tess, do you want me</i>

02:29.399 --> 02:30.984
<i>to release it
here in the kitchen?</i>

02:30.984 --> 02:32.277
<i>Okay, no, but just--
- Open the door. Come on.</i>

02:32.277 --> 02:33.820
<i>Keep... Wait.
- What?</i>

02:33.820 --> 02:35.363
<i>Keep it away from me.</i>

02:35.363 --> 02:37.073
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

02:37.073 --> 02:38.283
<i>How do you fucking do this?</i>

02:38.283 --> 02:40.118
<i>I know, I know, it sticks.
Just open it.</i>

02:40.118 --> 02:41.244
<i>Oh, goddamn it.</i>

02:41.244 --> 02:42.620
<i>No, don't get it near me.
- All right.</i>

02:42.620 --> 02:44.497
<i>It's all right.
- Okay, but just wait, let me,</i>

02:44.497 --> 02:46.875
<i>let me close the door first.
Let me close the door first.</i>

02:46.875 --> 02:48.543
<i>Okay.</i>

02:49.335 --> 02:50.879
<i>Okay. Okay, go.</i>

02:50.879 --> 02:53.381
All right, it's gone.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.258
<i>Are you all right?
We survived.</i>

02:55.258 --> 02:57.677
<i>Whew.
- Are you allergic?</i>

02:57.677 --> 02:59.554
<i>I just, I've never seen you
act like this.</i>

02:59.554 --> 03:03.391
<i>I don't know. Maybe.
Those plants need watering.</i>

03:05.268 --> 03:06.227
<i>What?</i>

03:06.227 --> 03:07.812
<i>What?
- This is locked.</i>

03:07.812 --> 03:09.439
<i>No, it's not.</i>

03:09.439 --> 03:11.900
<i>It's jammed.
It's not locked.</i>

03:17.113 --> 03:18.198
<i>It's locked.</i>

03:18.198 --> 03:20.116
<i>Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no.</i>

03:20.116 --> 03:22.702
<i>Please tell me you have
your phone on you.</i>

03:24.162 --> 03:25.538
<i>Do you?</i>

03:25.538 --> 03:27.373
<i>No.</i>

03:28.416 --> 03:32.045
<i>Are we fucking trapped
out here together?</i>

03:32.045 --> 03:34.339
<i>Well, it's certainly
feeling that way. Yeah.</i>

03:34.339 --> 03:36.090
<i>You're fucking kidding me.
Oh, my God.</i>

03:36.090 --> 03:38.801
<i>Uh-uh, no. Hello!</i>

03:38.801 --> 03:40.345
<i>What, um, what is his name?</i>

03:40.345 --> 03:42.680
<i>Harvey.
- Harvey!</i>

03:42.680 --> 03:45.558
<i>The-the wife, the wife...
What is the wife's name?</i>

03:45.558 --> 03:46.351
<i>Ellen.</i>

03:46.351 --> 03:48.061
<i>Ellen!
Why the fuck...</i>

03:48.061 --> 03:50.772
<i>They are never home!</i>

03:50.772 --> 03:52.190
<i>Mack. Mack. Mack!</i>

03:52.190 --> 03:54.067
<i>Mack! Mack!</i>

03:54.067 --> 03:55.902
<i>There we go. Come on.</i>

03:55.902 --> 03:57.362
<i>Be the hero, Mack.
Be the hero.</i>

03:57.362 --> 03:59.530
<i>Honey, up here. High-five me.
Come on, baby, high five.</i>

03:59.530 --> 04:00.907
<i>Paw.
- Oh, my God.</i>

04:00.907 --> 04:02.158
Paw, Mack, paw.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.952
<i>As if the dog can open the door.</i>

04:03.952 --> 04:05.119
<i>Do you have a better suggestion?</i>

04:05.119 --> 04:06.663
<i>Mack, come on, big boy.</i>

04:06.663 --> 04:07.622
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

04:07.622 --> 04:09.207
<i>Come up here.
- Oh, my God, is anybody</i>

04:09.207 --> 04:10.375
<i>gonna find us out here?
- Listen to your mom.</i>

04:10.375 --> 04:13.127
<i>Mack, Mack. Mack...
No, Mack.</i>

04:14.837 --> 04:16.965
<i>Ah, fuck!</i>

04:22.512 --> 04:26.099
You wanted to talk, right?

04:29.978 --> 04:31.354
<i>Okay, let's talk.</i>

04:31.354 --> 04:33.523
<i>Baby, you could be
the death of me</i>

04:33.523 --> 04:36.401
<i>Maybe I'm crazy</i>

04:36.401 --> 04:38.653
<i>I know you're danger</i>

04:39.237 --> 04:42.532
<i>Baby, you could be
the death of me</i>

04:42.532 --> 04:44.200
<i>I'm falling, fading</i>

04:44.200 --> 04:46.869
<i>And seeing angels</i>

04:46.869 --> 04:50.999
<i>Baby, you could be
the death of me</i>

04:56.045 --> 04:57.547
<i>G, are you busy?</i>

04:57.547 --> 05:00.842
<i>Please say no 'cause I kind of
have a she-mergency.</i>

05:00.842 --> 05:01.592
<i>What? What happened?</i>

05:01.592 --> 05:03.094
<i>Promise you won't judge me?</i>

05:03.094 --> 05:04.804
<i>I promise. Wh...?
- Um, okay,</i>

05:04.804 --> 05:08.433
<i>So I was at the Lambda Chi house
and one of the baseball guys</i>

05:08.433 --> 05:10.435
<i>was eyeing me.
- Uh-huh.</i>

05:10.435 --> 05:12.270
<i>I love how the booty looks
in those pants.</i>

05:12.270 --> 05:14.355
<i>I'm not sure I can help you out
with that one but--</i>

05:14.355 --> 05:15.732
<i>We started making out
in his room.</i>

05:15.732 --> 05:18.026
<i>He had, like, no bedsheets,
by the way.</i>

05:18.026 --> 05:19.902
<i>Ew. I...
- Angie...</i>

05:19.902 --> 05:21.029
<i>there's a condom stuck inside me</i>

05:21.029 --> 05:22.238
<i>and you got to help me
get it out.</i>

05:22.238 --> 05:23.489
<i>Please.</i>

05:23.489 --> 05:25.325
<i>Something about that
- A what?</i>

05:25.325 --> 05:27.994
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

05:27.994 --> 05:31.998
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...</i>

05:31.998 --> 05:34.042
<i>Okay, so...</i>

05:34.042 --> 05:36.002
<i>what do you want to know?</i>

05:37.211 --> 05:38.588
Oh, man, okay.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.007
Um...

05:41.007 --> 05:44.135
<i>What's their name?
- Um, Dre.</i>

05:44.135 --> 05:47.347
<i>She has a hot person's name.
- No, that is not</i>

05:47.347 --> 05:49.390
<i>a hot person's name.</i>

05:49.390 --> 05:51.225
<i>No. No.</i>

05:51.225 --> 05:53.019
<i>They're not hot.</i>

05:54.270 --> 05:55.605
<i>Okay.</i>

05:55.605 --> 05:58.274
<i>That actually makes me feel
a little bit better.</i>

05:58.274 --> 06:00.401
<i>Okay, good. Good.</i>

06:00.401 --> 06:03.905
<i>Um, how did you meet them?</i>

06:03.905 --> 06:08.117
<i>Um, I-I met them on Hinge.</i>

06:08.117 --> 06:10.244
<i>Hinge?
When did you join Hinge?</i>

06:10.244 --> 06:13.414
<i>After you left rehab</i>

06:13.414 --> 06:16.459
<i>and decided you were gonna stay
at sober living.</i>

06:16.459 --> 06:18.544
<i>Up in the Bay.</i>

06:20.004 --> 06:21.297
<i>I got lonely.</i>

06:23.424 --> 06:25.593
<i>Uh, how many times?</i>

06:25.593 --> 06:27.470
<i>How many times, what?</i>

06:27.470 --> 06:30.556
<i>How many times
did you sleep together?</i>

06:33.518 --> 06:35.019
<i>Once.</i>

06:35.019 --> 06:37.397
<i>So, you had a one-night stand?</i>

06:37.397 --> 06:39.190
Basically.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.860
<i>What does that mean?
- We...</i>

06:42.860 --> 06:46.823
<i>we slept together once,
but we hung out twice.</i>

06:47.365 --> 06:51.119
<i>Okay, so you liked them enough
to call them again.</i>

06:51.119 --> 06:54.122
<i>I guess so.</i>

06:55.206 --> 06:58.418
Uh...

06:58.418 --> 07:00.336
<i>Why did it end?</i>

07:00.336 --> 07:03.756
<i>Because I was in love with you.</i>

07:04.715 --> 07:08.010
<i>And I told them that,
and then that was it.</i>

07:08.010 --> 07:11.055
<i>Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

07:11.055 --> 07:12.181
Okay.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.391
<i>Right answer.</i>

07:15.184 --> 07:17.395
<i>Why didn't you just tell me?</i>

07:17.395 --> 07:19.439
<i>gentle music</i>

07:21.274 --> 07:26.946
<i>Because...
you were doing so well and...</i>

07:28.823 --> 07:33.786
<i>I didn't want to be the reason
you weren't doing well.</i>

07:38.291 --> 07:39.542
<i>Are they as charming as I am?</i>

07:39.542 --> 07:41.502
<i>No!
-</i>

07:41.502 --> 07:43.129
<i>No way.</i>

07:43.129 --> 07:45.298
<i>Got nothing on you.</i>

07:45.298 --> 07:46.299
<i>Yeah?</i>

07:46.299 --> 07:49.302
<i>upbeat, energetic music</i>

07:54.807 --> 07:57.393
<i>Yeah. No, I love you, too.</i>

07:57.393 --> 07:59.353
<i>I said I love you, too.</i>

07:59.353 --> 08:01.022
<i>Okay, yeah.</i>

08:01.022 --> 08:03.566
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

08:03.566 --> 08:05.443
<i>She knows.</i>

08:05.443 --> 08:07.195
<i>My mom knows that we're dating.</i>

08:07.195 --> 08:08.321
<i>Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

08:08.321 --> 08:10.239
<i>How scared
should I be of Grace?</i>

08:10.239 --> 08:11.657
<i>No, she's...
she's totally into it.</i>

08:11.657 --> 08:12.700
<i>Come on.
- Oh, my--</i>

08:12.700 --> 08:15.119
<i>Should we celebrate?
- Sure.</i>

08:15.119 --> 08:16.829
<i>You want to find a sperm donor?</i>

08:16.829 --> 08:20.541
<i>Whoa, that is way better
than what I was going to say.</i>

08:20.541 --> 08:21.751
<i>What were you going to say?</i>

08:21.751 --> 08:25.046
<i>Organize the Tupperware drawer?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

08:25.046 --> 08:27.548
<i>Okay, well, maybe we
could be wild and do both.</i>

08:27.548 --> 08:28.758
<i>Can we be in bed by 9:00?</i>

08:28.758 --> 08:32.553
<i>Maybe, uh... 8:30?
-</i>

08:32.553 --> 08:34.347
<i>Shut up.
What a dream!</i>

08:34.347 --> 08:36.098
<i>Okay. I'll get started
on the lids.</i>

08:36.098 --> 08:37.642
<i>Okay. Mwah.</i>

08:37.642 --> 08:39.644
<i>gentle, optimistic music</i>

08:41.062 --> 08:44.899
<i>No, no. I don't want to hear
how sorry you are.</i>

08:44.899 --> 08:46.651
<i>Okay, then,
what do you want to hear?</i>

08:46.651 --> 08:47.818
<i>Nothing, actually.</i>

08:47.818 --> 08:49.570
<i>There's nothing
that you could say.</i>

08:49.570 --> 08:50.947
<i>So just...
- Okay.</i>

08:50.947 --> 08:53.282
<i>Then I'll say nothing,
and then you'll say nothing.</i>

08:53.282 --> 08:57.119
<i>And sure, yeah.
That sounds like fun.</i>

08:57.119 --> 08:58.996
<i>Yeah, it does.</i>

09:06.379 --> 09:08.631
<i>I know you're
thinking something.</i>

09:08.631 --> 09:11.342
<i>I'm thinking that I'm an idiot.</i>

09:11.342 --> 09:14.095
<i>You're not an idiot.
- Oh, yes, I am.</i>

09:14.095 --> 09:16.222
<i>Because I knew about you.</i>

09:16.222 --> 09:19.100
<i>Your reputation.
Everybody does.</i>

09:20.059 --> 09:22.228
<i>But what-what I don't
understand is this...</i>

09:22.228 --> 09:24.522
<i>Is this really what you do?
Is this really who you are?</i>

09:24.522 --> 09:26.023
<i>You know who I am.</i>

09:26.023 --> 09:27.608
<i>I thought I did.</i>

09:27.608 --> 09:31.153
<i>I also thought
that you loved me.</i>

09:31.153 --> 09:32.488
<i>I do love you.</i>

09:32.488 --> 09:35.408
<i>You have a really fucked-up
way of showing it, Shane.</i>

09:35.408 --> 09:38.327
<i>You're right. I do.</i>

09:38.327 --> 09:40.955
<i>I understand that.</i>

09:42.832 --> 09:45.751
<i>I didn't mean to hurt you.</i>

09:47.295 --> 09:48.087
<i>I didn't.</i>

09:48.087 --> 09:53.092
<i>Well, you failed miserably
at that then.</i>

09:56.721 --> 10:00.600
<i>I do want to know why though.</i>

10:00.600 --> 10:02.810
<i>Just an old pattern.</i>

10:04.312 --> 10:05.730
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

10:05.730 --> 10:08.316
<i>I don't know why.</i>

10:09.400 --> 10:10.943
<i>Okay.</i>

10:14.864 --> 10:16.198
<i>Then how about you
take this time</i>

10:16.198 --> 10:18.784
<i>while we're locked out here
on your fucking patio</i>

10:18.784 --> 10:20.911
<i>and think about it.</i>

10:31.797 --> 10:33.883
<i>Okay, so what
the website said to do</i>

10:33.883 --> 10:35.051
<i>is to get into the position</i>

10:35.051 --> 10:37.178
<i>that you would
to put in a tampon.</i>

10:37.178 --> 10:39.555
<i>Okay.</i>

10:39.555 --> 10:41.807
<i>Wait, that's how
you put in a tampon?</i>

10:41.807 --> 10:44.477
<i>How do you do it?
- Like this.</i>

10:44.477 --> 10:46.145
<i>Oh.</i>

10:46.145 --> 10:47.605
<i>Okay, and then it said</i>

10:47.605 --> 10:49.565
<i>you need to, like, put your fi--</i>

10:49.565 --> 10:51.567
<i>two fingers, and like a,
like a hooking,</i>

10:51.567 --> 10:53.361
<i>like a hook, hook,
hooking situation.</i>

10:53.361 --> 10:54.820
<i>Okay.
- To try to get it out.</i>

10:54.820 --> 10:56.614
<i>Okay.
- Okay.</i>

10:56.614 --> 10:57.698
<i>Mm.</i>

10:57.698 --> 10:59.825
<i>pulsing, intriguing music</i>

11:05.164 --> 11:08.751
<i>Mm, I-I can't tell what's me
and what's the condom.</i>

11:08.751 --> 11:10.378
<i>Just feel for something slimy.</i>

11:10.378 --> 11:11.879
<i>Well, everything is slimy.</i>

11:11.879 --> 11:13.589
<i>Ow, ow, ow.
- Oh, no, what's wrong?</i>

11:13.589 --> 11:14.882
<i>What's wrong?
- Mm.</i>

11:14.882 --> 11:16.717
<i>I picked the wrong day
to get my claws done.</i>

11:16.717 --> 11:18.803
<i>Ow! Okay, okay.
This isn't working.</i>

11:18.803 --> 11:20.513
Just calm down.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.681
<i>Just calm down.</i>

11:21.681 --> 11:23.557
<i>That's, like, the main thing.
You're okay.</i>

11:23.557 --> 11:26.310
<i>Okay, okay.
- Take a deep breath.</i>

11:26.310 --> 11:27.561
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

11:33.776 --> 11:35.069
<i>Angie?</i>

11:35.069 --> 11:35.945
<i>What?</i>

11:35.945 --> 11:40.741
<i>Will you please
get it out for me?</i>

11:40.741 --> 11:43.619
<i>Gotta move things forward,
everywhere I go</i>

11:43.619 --> 11:46.038
Hey, D-bag, it's Roxy.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.207
<i>I caught an early flight
to Costa Rica.</i>

11:48.207 --> 11:50.543
<i>Good job crying it out
the other night.</i>

11:50.543 --> 11:51.919
<i>The real deal is gonna happen</i>

11:51.919 --> 11:53.587
<i>for you soon. Trust me.
- No, no, no. Oh, yo! Yo!</i>

11:53.587 --> 11:55.589
<i>Whoa, bro!
- Hey, hey, hey. Watch it!</i>

11:55.589 --> 11:57.383
<i>upbeat music</i>

11:57.383 --> 11:58.759
Oh, shit.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.094
<i>You good?</i>

12:00.094 --> 12:03.055
<i>Yeah, I get it,
it's all happening quickly</i>

12:03.055 --> 12:04.014
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:04.014 --> 12:05.850
<i>The scooter almost
took you out. [laughs]</i>

12:05.850 --> 12:06.976
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:06.976 --> 12:08.853
<i>When I'm crying all night</i>

12:08.853 --> 12:11.105
<i>I think you might have
just saved my life.</i>

12:12.773 --> 12:14.525
<i>From my mouth, huh?</i>

12:14.525 --> 12:16.902
<i>I feel like I should
kiss you right now.</i>

12:16.902 --> 12:18.779
<i>But, I mean, I won't</i>

12:18.779 --> 12:22.700
<i>because this is real life
and not a shitty rom-com.</i>

12:22.700 --> 12:24.493
<i>I'm trying, I'm trying hard</i>

12:24.493 --> 12:29.331
<i>Still you managed to get me
with my guard down</i>

12:29.331 --> 12:32.543
<i>How? How? How?</i>

12:33.127 --> 12:36.422
<i>I like it, don't stop now</i>

12:36.422 --> 12:38.924
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

12:38.924 --> 12:40.926
<i>No, no, no. No.
Don't, don't apologize.</i>

12:40.926 --> 12:42.261
<i>I'm sorry.
- No...</i>

12:42.261 --> 12:45.765
<i>I just, I didn't mean to
just kiss you, it just...</i>

12:45.765 --> 12:47.475
<i>Whoo-ooh-ooh</i>

12:47.475 --> 12:49.101
Next up, we have...

12:49.101 --> 12:50.895
<i>What do you think?
You gonna, uh...</i>

12:50.895 --> 12:52.521
<i>sign up, serenade me again?</i>

12:52.521 --> 12:55.316
That was a good move, okay?

12:55.316 --> 12:56.650
<i>It was.
- It sure was.</i>

12:56.650 --> 12:59.445
<i>It worked. I believe I went home
with you that night.</i>

12:59.445 --> 13:02.364
<i>Oh, you sure did.
- You got me.</i>

13:02.364 --> 13:03.949
<i>Where's my song?</i>

13:03.949 --> 13:06.368
<i>Oh, you do not want to hear
this bad boy sing.</i>

13:06.368 --> 13:07.620
<i>Yes, I do.
- No.</i>

13:07.620 --> 13:08.871
<i>Sing for me, please.</i>

13:08.871 --> 13:10.915
<i>Sing something in my ear. Go.</i>

13:14.585 --> 13:15.711
<i>Okay, stop, stop,</i>

13:15.711 --> 13:17.338
<i>you're hotter when you don't.</i>

13:17.338 --> 13:18.631
<i>Okay. See, I told you.</i>

13:18.631 --> 13:20.257
But I do have something

13:20.257 --> 13:23.093
<i>that, um, you might
like way better</i>

13:23.093 --> 13:25.262
<i>that I've been
thinking about all day.</i>

13:25.262 --> 13:27.515
<i>Yeah, what?</i>

13:28.349 --> 13:32.186
<i>You want to meet me
in the back office in ten?</i>

13:32.770 --> 13:33.854
<i>Really?</i>

13:33.854 --> 13:36.690
<i>Yeah, I'm the,
uh, big boss tonight.</i>

13:36.690 --> 13:39.026
<i>Ooh, big boss.
Big boss lady.</i>

13:39.026 --> 13:40.820
<i>Yeah, I'm in charge.</i>

13:40.820 --> 13:41.987
Ew.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.072
<i>Oh. Sorry.
- Sorry.</i>

13:43.072 --> 13:45.699
<i>I'm kidding. Hi.
- Hi.</i>

13:45.699 --> 13:47.701
<i>Uh, can I get you anything?
- Yes.</i>

13:47.701 --> 13:49.370
<i>I'll have a tequila rocks.</i>

13:49.370 --> 13:51.831
<i>Okay. Nothing cheap.
- Okay. No, I know, bud.</i>

13:51.831 --> 13:54.834
<i>I've been to your house.
Okay? [clucks tongue]</i>

13:54.834 --> 13:56.710
<i>Okay.
- So, uh...</i>

13:56.710 --> 13:58.212
<i>Wait, where's Roxy?
- Oh, she's...</i>

13:58.212 --> 14:00.548
<i>she's off to Costa Rica
because of course she is.</i>

14:00.548 --> 14:02.007
<i>Can I tell you something</i>

14:02.007 --> 14:04.218
<i>without you being
totally judgy?</i>

14:04.218 --> 14:07.054
<i>Uh, when have I ever?
- Okay.</i>

14:07.054 --> 14:09.598
<i>I just kissed
this really hot person.</i>

14:09.598 --> 14:10.850
What?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.768
<i>Yeah.
- Okay.</i>

14:12.768 --> 14:14.061
<i>I'm thinking maybe
I'll have, like a,</i>

14:14.061 --> 14:15.479
<i>like a hot girl autumn
or something?</i>

14:15.479 --> 14:16.647
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

14:16.647 --> 14:18.399
<i>I love this for you!</i>

14:18.399 --> 14:19.483
<i>They saved my life.</i>

14:19.483 --> 14:20.609
<i>Did I mention that?
- No.</i>

14:20.609 --> 14:21.694
<i>I was literally</i>

14:21.694 --> 14:23.112
<i>like J.Lo
in The Wedding Planner.</i>

14:23.112 --> 14:25.739
<i>Oh, my God, you get to be
J.Lo in The Wedding Planner?</i>

14:25.739 --> 14:27.491
<i>I fucking love that movie.</i>

14:27.491 --> 14:28.701
<i>Me too!
- Wait,</i>

14:28.701 --> 14:31.412
<i>but also problematic
culturally... [hisses]</i>

14:31.412 --> 14:32.329
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>

14:32.329 --> 14:33.873
<i>but everything in
the 2000s kind of was.</i>

14:33.873 --> 14:34.915
I know.

14:34.915 --> 14:35.958
<i>What, what?</i>

14:35.958 --> 14:37.209
<i>She was playing
an Italian person.</i>

14:37.209 --> 14:38.836
<i>J.Lo is Puerto Rican!
- Right.</i>

14:38.836 --> 14:40.462
<i>And what was that, the-the guy
with the shitty accent?</i>

14:40.462 --> 14:42.339
<i>Oh, my God, what was his name?</i>

14:42.339 --> 14:43.549
<i>Massimo!</i>

14:44.675 --> 14:46.844
<i>Oh, my God.
- So cheesy.</i>

14:46.844 --> 14:49.763
<i>Oh, God, we loved Massimo.
Oh, my God, wait.</i>

14:49.763 --> 14:51.974
<i>What did J.Lo say
when Matthew McConaughey</i>

14:51.974 --> 14:53.976
<i>saved her fucking life?
It was, um...</i>

14:53.976 --> 14:56.896
<i>Oh, she goes, she goes,
"You saved...</i>

14:56.896 --> 14:59.231
<i>...my shoe."</i>

15:01.150 --> 15:05.279
<i>Wow, we have
a ton of options here.</i>

15:05.279 --> 15:07.907
<i>Well, the, uh, the rock climber
sounded promising.</i>

15:07.907 --> 15:09.450
<i>Eh, he's only five-seven.</i>

15:09.450 --> 15:12.620
<i>Six-plus or bust.
We are not messing around here.</i>

15:12.620 --> 15:13.996
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

15:13.996 --> 15:15.789
<i>Are you serious?
- I mean,</i>

15:15.789 --> 15:17.791
<i>why not?
If you have the option to.</i>

15:17.791 --> 15:20.169
<i>My family are all shorties.</i>

15:20.169 --> 15:22.046
<i>We have to average it out somehow.</i>

15:22.046 --> 15:23.631
<i>Right. Okay.</i>

15:23.631 --> 15:25.341
<i>Okay, I definitely think</i>

15:25.341 --> 15:27.051
<i>that we should go
with the athletic body type.</i>

15:27.051 --> 15:30.554
<i>This is weird.
It's weird. It's weird.</i>

15:30.554 --> 15:32.306
<i>Why?</i>

15:32.306 --> 15:34.516
<i>It kind of feels like eugenics.
- What?</i>

15:34.516 --> 15:36.435
<i>No! Ew, no.
- Come on.</i>

15:36.435 --> 15:38.854
<i>I'm sorry but, you know,
choosing physical traits,</i>

15:38.854 --> 15:41.440
<i>it's-it's weird, right?
- No, it's not.</i>

15:41.440 --> 15:46.779
<i>Look, we have a chance
to design the perfect baby.</i>

15:49.949 --> 15:51.992
<i>Yeah, it's eugenics.</i>

15:51.992 --> 15:53.619
<i>Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

15:53.619 --> 15:56.705
<i>Um, also, this is insane.</i>

15:56.705 --> 15:58.457
<i>Why do we have
so much Tupperware?</i>

15:58.457 --> 16:00.501
<i>We have a problem.</i>

16:15.933 --> 16:18.602
<i>Oh. Shane!</i>

16:18.602 --> 16:20.354
<i>Psst, Shane!</i>

16:20.354 --> 16:22.481
<i>Oh.</i>

16:23.023 --> 16:24.692
<i>That's not Shane.</i>

16:29.738 --> 16:31.281
It makes sense, but, like,

16:31.281 --> 16:33.701
<i>this is like wax and sugar.
Is this good?</i>

16:33.701 --> 16:35.619
<i>Oh, yeah, that's great.</i>

16:35.619 --> 16:38.872
<i>intriguing music</i>

16:43.210 --> 16:45.671
<i>You can have the salty popcorn.</i>

16:59.768 --> 17:02.688
Sex always means something.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.691
<i>To me it really is... just sex.</i>

17:05.691 --> 17:09.445
<i>So what, are you like proposing
we do ENM or something?</i>

17:09.445 --> 17:12.614
<i>I don't know what that is.
- Ethical Non-Monogamy.</i>

17:12.614 --> 17:13.949
<i>It's like multiple partners.</i>

17:13.949 --> 17:16.910
<i>No, no, no, no, no.
I just...</i>

17:18.662 --> 17:20.205
<i>I wanted you.</i>

17:20.205 --> 17:24.209
<i>Well, it does not
feel like that.</i>

17:26.962 --> 17:29.465
<i>Are you an addict?</i>

17:30.049 --> 17:32.468
<i>I don't know.
- Because when I think about</i>

17:32.468 --> 17:37.222
<i>your behavior like that, like,
it makes more sense to me.</i>

17:40.851 --> 17:43.520
<i>M-Maybe I am.</i>

17:44.980 --> 17:47.107
<i>O-Okay.</i>

17:47.107 --> 17:51.153
<i>Okay, then...
- It's not that simple though.</i>

17:51.153 --> 17:53.739
<i>It's just, it's been a lot.</i>

17:55.032 --> 17:56.075
<i>Hasn't it?</i>

17:56.075 --> 17:58.619
<i>Admit that. Please.</i>

17:58.619 --> 18:00.120
<i>Uh, okay.</i>

18:00.120 --> 18:02.414
<i>When you moved in here,
it was great.</i>

18:02.414 --> 18:05.125
<i>It was. And then,
and then your mom comes.</i>

18:05.125 --> 18:07.544
<i>Oh, my God, that is not fair.</i>

18:07.544 --> 18:09.088
<i>You said that you wanted her
to move in.</i>

18:09.088 --> 18:10.798
<i>Wait, wait.
No, no, no, no, no.</i>

18:10.798 --> 18:11.965
<i>Let me finish.</i>

18:11.965 --> 18:14.134
<i>I'm glad she came here.</i>

18:14.134 --> 18:16.595
<i>And I'm so happy
we could help her.</i>

18:16.595 --> 18:17.971
<i>I don't regret that.</i>

18:17.971 --> 18:20.599
<i>We also have Dana's.</i>

18:20.599 --> 18:22.392
<i>And then you want a second bar.</i>

18:22.392 --> 18:26.647
<i>And somewhere
within all of that...</i>

18:27.898 --> 18:30.150
<i>...you changed.</i>

18:30.150 --> 18:32.736
<i>And you stopped seeing me.</i>

18:34.404 --> 18:36.365
<i>I'm not trying to blame you.</i>

18:36.365 --> 18:38.659
<i>I'm just trying to explain this.</i>

18:38.659 --> 18:40.744
<i>There was a disconnect.</i>

18:40.744 --> 18:42.496
Yes. Okay, yes.

18:42.496 --> 18:46.708
<i>Like, it's...
It's been hard.</i>

18:46.708 --> 18:48.418
<i>But you know</i>

18:48.418 --> 18:53.215
<i>what I did when I started
feeling like it was too much?</i>

18:53.215 --> 18:56.510
<i>I wrote in my fucking journal,</i>

18:56.510 --> 18:57.594
<i>Shane.</i>

18:57.594 --> 19:00.055
<i>I didn't go out
and fuck the first person</i>

19:00.055 --> 19:03.016
<i>that showed me
some kind of attention.</i>

19:04.434 --> 19:06.353

19:06.353 --> 19:08.188
<i>Yeah, no shit, I'm right.</i>

19:10.440 --> 19:12.359
Anyway, how's work?

19:12.359 --> 19:14.153
<i>It's good.
- Yeah?</i>

19:14.153 --> 19:15.571
<i>Yeah, um,
I'm actually throwing</i>

<i>Fletcher?</i>

19:18.407 --> 19:20.033
<i>Mm-hmm.
- Can I come?</i>

19:20.033 --> 19:22.244
<i>Yeah, everyone can come.
- Wow.</i>

19:22.244 --> 19:25.205
<i>Yeah, I feel like things
are finally turning around.</i>

19:25.205 --> 19:27.499
Yeah.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.459
<i>Can you, can you play this one?</i>

19:29.459 --> 19:31.295
<i>I'll give you the signal.
- All right.</i>

19:31.295 --> 19:32.337
<i>Oh, my God. That's them.</i>

- I missed you, too.</i>

20:25.224 --> 20:30.062
<i>It's pretty clear
that I'm not over you</i>

20:31.980 --> 20:36.944
<i>I'm still thinking 'bout
the things you do</i>

- No problem.</i>

23:06.259 --> 23:07.677
<i>No.</i>

23:07.677 --> 23:10.305
<i>Well, would you consider it?</i>

23:10.305 --> 23:12.182
<i>Yeah, I mean...</i>

23:13.558 --> 23:16.019
<i>...if I thought it would help.</i>

23:16.520 --> 23:20.107
<i>I'm not against it.
- It does work.</i>

23:20.816 --> 23:25.654
<i>I know that you have been
through so much.</i>

23:25.654 --> 23:28.824
<i>I try to remind myself of that</i>

23:28.824 --> 23:34.579
<i>every... every time
I think about that you...</i>

23:35.705 --> 23:39.209
<i>Just say it.
I cheated on you. Right?</i>

23:39.209 --> 23:41.753
<i>Yes, that you cheated.</i>

23:42.462 --> 23:45.006
<i>We've all been through a lot.</i>

23:45.006 --> 23:46.675
<i>All of us.</i>

23:46.675 --> 23:50.762
<i>But we all don't hurt people
the way that you do.</i>

23:50.762 --> 23:52.806
<i>And that's nobody else's fault.</i>

23:52.806 --> 23:54.558
<i>I'm not saying it is.
- Okay, so you need to</i>

23:54.558 --> 23:56.643
<i>take responsibility for that.</i>

23:56.643 --> 23:58.812
<i>I am taking
responsibility for it.</i>

23:58.812 --> 24:00.772
<i>Have I been denying this?
- No.</i>

24:00.772 --> 24:06.236
<i>You're taking responsibility
for it now because you feel bad.</i>

24:07.487 --> 24:10.323
<i>So what happens when
that feeling disappears,</i>

24:10.323 --> 24:12.534
<i>and you're not feeling
so bad about it?</i>

24:12.534 --> 24:14.870
<i>Are you still gonna want to take
responsibility for it?</i>

24:14.870 --> 24:16.538
<i>Because that's
what has to happen</i>

24:16.538 --> 24:18.290
<i>in order for you to change.</i>

24:19.332 --> 24:23.003
<i>And I need you to change.</i>

24:23.003 --> 24:24.337
<i>I want you to change.</i>

24:24.337 --> 24:27.507
<i>Like, but, is that,
is that something that you want?</i>

24:27.507 --> 24:30.177
<i>Do you want to change?</i>

24:34.681 --> 24:37.559
<i>Yeah, everybody just make
your way to the exit.</i>

24:37.559 --> 24:38.518
<i>Thank you.</i>

24:38.518 --> 24:40.187
<i>Please, leave your drinks.</i>

24:40.187 --> 24:41.521
<i>Night, night's over.
I'm so sorry.</i>

24:41.521 --> 24:43.106
<i>This-this isn't a drill.</i>

24:43.106 --> 24:44.357
<i>We appreciate the business.</i>

24:44.357 --> 24:45.734
<i>Just make your way calmly.</i>

The-the alarm is going off.</i>

24:53.492 --> 24:54.993
<i>I saw you pull the alarm, okay?</i>

24:54.993 --> 24:56.995
<i>I need, I need you
to leave the premises.</i>

24:56.995 --> 24:59.289
<i>I didn't know that
they were going to be here.</i>

24:59.289 --> 25:00.415
<i>I didn't know.
- Please.</i>

25:00.415 --> 25:02.417
<i>Go, go!</i>

25:02.417 --> 25:04.544
<i>It's for your own safety,
ma'am, please.</i>

25:04.544 --> 25:05.837
<i>Fin, come on.</i>

25:05.837 --> 25:09.007
<i>I need you to exit
the building, please!</i>

<i>No shame.
- No, but, yeah.</i>

<i>That's, like, a big question
to ask before I penetrate you.</i>

27:56.883 --> 27:59.636
Okay, it felt natch to me.

27:59.636 --> 28:00.845
<i>Well, he asked me to go away</i>

28:00.845 --> 28:03.014

- OMG, are you gonna do it?</i>

28:03.014 --> 28:07.686

- But what?</i>

28:07.686 --> 28:10.480
<i>Ask me anything.
I'm an open book.</i>

28:11.731 --> 28:15.568
<i>I just don't even know
like how it starts.</i>

28:15.568 --> 28:16.736
<i>Okay.</i>

28:16.736 --> 28:18.905
<i>My experience is, like,</i>

28:18.905 --> 28:20.657
<i>it will be super awkward
and quiet,</i>

28:20.657 --> 28:22.534
<i>and then I'll lean in
and kiss whoever it is,</i>

28:22.534 --> 28:23.993
<i>and then it sort of
just goes from there.</i>

28:23.993 --> 28:26.079
<i>Cool.
- With consent, of course.</i>

28:26.079 --> 28:27.664
<i>Of course,
yeah, we love consent.</i>

28:27.664 --> 28:29.916

He touches you.</i>

like, a little off.</i>

28:33.712 --> 28:34.754
<i>Off, how?</i>

28:34.754 --> 28:36.089
<i>Hmm, they miss. They think</i>

28:36.089 --> 28:37.632
<i>they're on your clit
and they're rubbing your labio</i>

- Ew.</i>

28:39.467 --> 28:41.052
Stop it.

28:41.052 --> 28:43.388

a little bit.</i>

28:48.435 --> 28:49.561
<i>Tell them what you like.</i>

28:49.561 --> 28:51.438

<i>PowerPoint presentation that pussy.</i>

28:55.525 --> 28:57.026
<i>And I'll just know what I want.</i>

28:57.026 --> 29:00.155
<i>Yeah, you got to trust
your instincts.</i>

29:00.155 --> 29:02.282
<i>You probably know
a lot more than you think.</i>

29:02.282 --> 29:04.284
<i>Okay.
- Okay.</i>

29:04.284 --> 29:05.452
<i>I'm ready.</i>

29:05.452 --> 29:06.619
<i>Okay.</i>

29:07.787 --> 29:09.914
<i>Okay, please let me know
if I hurt you.</i>

29:09.914 --> 29:11.458
<i>Mm-hmm. Just-just do it.</i>

29:11.458 --> 29:14.127
<i>Do it.
- Okay. Ready? Here we go.</i>

29:20.383 --> 29:22.218
<i>Mm. Mm.</i>

29:22.719 --> 29:24.679
<i>I got it. I got it!
- Oh, my God!</i>

29:24.679 --> 29:27.015
<i>Thank you!
- Oh, my God, ew, ew, ew.</i>

29:27.015 --> 29:29.559
<i>I knew you could do it!
I knew you could do it!</i>

29:29.559 --> 29:31.394
<i>I feel really accomplished!</i>

29:31.394 --> 29:32.771
<i>Yes!
- Oh.</i>

29:32.771 --> 29:35.774
<i>Good, good. Oh, my God.
- Wow. Wow.</i>

29:35.774 --> 29:40.862
<i>Oh, well, now you just got to do
a little something for yourself.</i>

29:40.862 --> 29:42.197
<i>Like what?</i>

29:42.197 --> 29:45.450
<i>Like this.</i>

29:45.450 --> 29:46.618
<i>Here.</i>

29:46.618 --> 29:47.994
<i>Yeah, we are fired up.</i>

29:52.665 --> 29:54.959
<i>Uh, excuse me,</i>

29:54.959 --> 29:56.503
<i>can you please move?</i>

29:56.503 --> 29:58.087
<i>I'm trying to watch the movie.</i>

29:58.087 --> 29:59.798
<i>Oh, it's just gonna take
a second.</i>

29:59.798 --> 30:01.007
<i>You're being rude.</i>

30:01.007 --> 30:04.594
<i>I'm trying to spy
on my girlfriend.</i>

30:06.054 --> 30:07.555
<i>Hey, actually,
what do you think?</i>

30:07.555 --> 30:09.516
<i>You think they look like
they're on a date?</i>

30:09.516 --> 30:11.142
<i>Or do you think that could be,</i>

30:11.142 --> 30:14.187
<i>like, her cousin or something?
It's hard to tell.</i>

30:14.187 --> 30:15.230
<i>I can't...</i>

30:15.230 --> 30:17.941
<i>I can't really tell from here.
Can you?</i>

30:17.941 --> 30:19.359
That's the most exciting thing

30:19.359 --> 30:21.903
<i>anyone's ever done for me.
- Ooh.</i>

30:21.903 --> 30:24.322
<i>Well, let's hope
they're not full-blood.</i>

30:24.989 --> 30:26.825
<i>What the actual fuck, Taylor?</i>

30:26.825 --> 30:28.952
<i>You're on a date?
- Alice?</i>

30:28.952 --> 30:30.453
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

30:33.915 --> 30:36.209
Are you crazy?

30:36.209 --> 30:37.836
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

30:37.836 --> 30:38.920
<i>You lied to me.</i>

30:38.920 --> 30:40.088
<i>Sit down, lady.</i>

30:40.088 --> 30:41.631
<i>Okay, this is just gonna
take a second, sir,</i>

30:41.631 --> 30:42.966
<i>so just pipe down.</i>

30:42.966 --> 30:47.345
<i>You told me you were working
and you're clearly on a date.</i>

30:48.304 --> 30:49.430
<i>I know.</i>

30:49.430 --> 30:50.431
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

30:50.431 --> 30:51.975
<i>I shouldn't have lied to you
about having to work.</i>

30:51.975 --> 30:54.185
Yeah, no shit.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.812
<i>I thought we were,
like, a thing.</i>

30:55.812 --> 30:57.105
<i>We are a thing.</i>

30:57.105 --> 30:59.858
<i>And we can be a thing, too.
We just don't know yet,</i>

30:59.858 --> 31:01.734
<i>because we're dating.</i>

31:01.734 --> 31:03.987
<i>Yeah, we're dating.</i>

31:03.987 --> 31:05.697
<i>Yes, this is dating.
We date each other</i>

31:05.697 --> 31:07.991
<i>and we date other people.</i>

31:07.991 --> 31:09.367
<i>Uh, since when?</i>

31:09.367 --> 31:12.579
<i>Since the beginning of time,
as far as I know.</i>

31:12.579 --> 31:14.289
<i>Well, I wish somebody
had told me.</i>

31:14.289 --> 31:15.748
<i>Namely you.</i>

31:15.748 --> 31:16.875
<i>I thought you knew.</i>

31:16.875 --> 31:18.293
<i>And I definitely thought</i>

31:18.293 --> 31:20.044
<i>you were dating
other people, too.</i>

31:20.044 --> 31:22.630
<i>Why would you think that?
- I don't know.</i>

31:22.630 --> 31:23.673
<i>You're famous.</i>

31:23.673 --> 31:24.924


31:24.924 --> 31:26.050
<i>Who is she?</i>

31:26.050 --> 31:27.677
<i>Okay...
- Is it Ellen?</i>

31:27.677 --> 31:30.847
<i>No. Okay, that is such
a bullshit excuse.</i>

31:30.847 --> 31:32.682
<i>I should just go.
- No.</i>

31:32.682 --> 31:35.685
<i>What?
- No, you should stay.</i>

31:35.685 --> 31:37.270
<i>Alice...</i>

31:37.270 --> 31:40.523
<i>It's not an excuse. Okay?
It's just a fact.</i>

31:40.523 --> 31:42.108
<i>I like you.</i>

31:42.108 --> 31:44.110
<i>But I also like my regular life.</i>

31:44.110 --> 31:47.196
<i>And those two things
don't naturally go together</i>

31:47.196 --> 31:49.073
<i>because we just live
in different worlds.</i>

31:49.073 --> 31:51.576
<i>You with the reg--
Oh, my God, I'm normal.</i>

31:51.576 --> 31:53.369
<i>I have normal friends.</i>

31:53.369 --> 31:54.495
<i>No. You're not.</i>

31:54.495 --> 31:57.415
<i>And you haven't been for so long
you can't even see it.</i>

31:57.415 --> 31:59.125
<i>No. No, you know what?</i>

31:59.125 --> 32:01.127
<i>I think you're looking for
things that are wrong</i>

32:01.127 --> 32:02.545
<i>because this is right.</i>

32:02.545 --> 32:04.881
<i>Did you ever think of that?
Did that ever occur to you?</i>

32:04.881 --> 32:07.967
<i>That maybe this is about you
and not about me?</i>

32:07.967 --> 32:09.469
<i>I just need to go slow.</i>

32:09.469 --> 32:12.305
<i>You know, just turn
the heat down a little.</i>

32:12.305 --> 32:15.725
<i>And I guess I just didn't know
how to tell you that.</i>

32:15.725 --> 32:17.936
<i>Well, this way sucked.</i>

32:17.936 --> 32:19.896
<i>For all of us.
- Sit down.</i>

32:19.896 --> 32:21.272
<i>Oh, shut it, mister.
- Yeah.</i>

32:21.272 --> 32:23.983
<i>You never had a little
dating drama in your life?</i>

32:23.983 --> 32:25.652
<i>No.</i>

32:26.986 --> 32:30.990
<i>I'm sorry... I lied to you.
I really am.</i>

32:30.990 --> 32:33.826
<i>Yeah, I am, too.</i>

32:36.204 --> 32:38.414
<i>You like her more than me?</i>

32:38.414 --> 32:40.166
<i>Alice.</i>

32:40.959 --> 32:43.169
<i>You didn't have to answer that.</i>

32:43.169 --> 32:46.631
<i>Well, enjoy your movie.</i>

32:49.342 --> 32:52.345
<i>By the way, he dies in the end!</i>

32:52.345 --> 32:55.473
<i>Come on, lady!
-</i>

32:56.349 --> 33:00.728
<i>Okay, okay, let's just think
of another way to pick a donor.</i>

33:00.728 --> 33:04.482
<i>Right? Let's, uh,
not focus on perfection.</i>

33:05.191 --> 33:06.943
<i>What are we looking for?</i>

33:06.943 --> 33:08.611
<i>I guess you.</i>

33:09.821 --> 33:13.574
<i>You have managed to both
flatter me and insult me?</i>

33:13.574 --> 33:15.076
<i>Only you can really do that.</i>

33:15.076 --> 33:16.160
<i>Oh, thanks.</i>

33:16.160 --> 33:19.497
<i>Okay, so, who are you?</i>

33:19.497 --> 33:20.623
<i>Uh...</i>

33:20.623 --> 33:23.001
<i>Okay, me, uh...</i>

33:23.001 --> 33:25.712
<i>Who am I? Um...</i>

33:25.712 --> 33:27.714
<i>I am Chinese American.</i>

33:27.714 --> 33:30.258
<i>That feels important.
- Of course.</i>

33:30.258 --> 33:32.176
<i>Uh, I don't know, I'm anxious.</i>

33:32.176 --> 33:34.262
You want our kid to be anxious?

33:34.262 --> 33:37.682
<i>No, no, of course not.
I'm just describing myself.</i>

33:37.682 --> 33:38.808
<i>You like books.</i>

33:38.808 --> 33:40.184
<i>That's true. I do.</i>

33:40.184 --> 33:42.854
<i>But, I mean,
is there a section for that?</i>

33:42.854 --> 33:44.147
<i>I see, uh,</i>

33:44.147 --> 33:46.733
<i>favorites animal,
favorite person,</i>

33:46.733 --> 33:48.818
<i>education, food. I mean...</i>

33:48.818 --> 33:53.239
This is really making me sad.

33:54.449 --> 33:55.825
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:55.825 --> 33:57.910
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

33:57.910 --> 34:00.079
<i>You know, this was
supposed to be really fun,</i>

34:00.079 --> 34:02.790
<i>and it's just
depressing, really.</i>

34:02.790 --> 34:05.334
<i>I just wish we could
make a baby</i>

34:05.334 --> 34:07.712
<i>that's part of you
and part of me and...</i>

34:07.712 --> 34:09.130
<i>Yeah, me too.
-</i>

34:09.130 --> 34:12.800
<i>Cis-heads can just get drunk
and do this on accident,</i>

34:12.800 --> 34:14.969
<i>but we have
to self-reflect and...</i>

34:14.969 --> 34:16.304
<i>Oh, cis-heads definitely need</i>

34:16.304 --> 34:18.264
<i>to be doing some
self-reflecting, too.</i>

34:18.264 --> 34:20.183
<i>And there should be a test.
- Right?</i>

34:20.183 --> 34:22.977
<i>There's a test for everything,
except to be a parent.</i>

34:22.977 --> 34:25.521
<i>Any idiot could do it.
- Oh, and they do.</i>

34:25.521 --> 34:26.647
<i>All the time.</i>

34:26.647 --> 34:28.775
<i>Okay, maybe we just have to</i>

34:28.775 --> 34:30.151
<i>figure out
what we have in common.</i>

34:30.151 --> 34:34.405
<i>So the baby, like,
fits in our family, you know?</i>

34:34.405 --> 34:36.365
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:36.365 --> 34:38.493
<i>Yeah, I love that idea.
- Okay.</i>

34:38.493 --> 34:40.119
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

34:40.119 --> 34:44.040
<i>Well, let's see if
shit-talking is a category.</i>

34:44.040 --> 34:46.417
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, it's right here.</i>

34:46.417 --> 34:49.796
<i>Under religion.
- Wow. [laughs]</i>

34:50.421 --> 34:53.549
I thought you were it for me.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.303
<i>Yeah, I never...</i>

34:57.303 --> 35:00.056
<i>let myself think about
the future.</i>

35:00.056 --> 35:01.599
<i>'Cause my mom,</i>

35:01.599 --> 35:03.601
<i>she always made
all of these big promises,</i>

35:03.601 --> 35:07.188
<i>every time she got a new gig,
or met a new guy.</i>

35:07.188 --> 35:10.149
<i>And none of them
ever panned out.</i>

35:10.149 --> 35:11.526
<i>So...</i>

35:11.526 --> 35:15.321
<i>I just stopped
thinking long-term.</i>

35:15.321 --> 35:16.781
Yep.

35:16.781 --> 35:17.949
<i>And I've tried,</i>

35:17.949 --> 35:21.035
<i>but I've never been able
to think long-term.</i>

35:21.035 --> 35:23.663
<i>I let myself with you though.</i>

35:25.248 --> 35:29.502
<i>I saw my life with you.</i>

35:30.211 --> 35:32.088
<i>Us getting old together.</i>

35:32.088 --> 35:35.842
<i>I've never been able
to do that with anyone.</i>

35:36.676 --> 35:38.219
<i>But it can't happen.</i>

35:38.219 --> 35:39.512
<i>Unless you really</i>

35:39.512 --> 35:42.682
<i>try to figure out why it is
you do what you do.</i>

35:42.682 --> 35:44.934
<i>Because if you don't,
we're just gonna end up</i>

35:44.934 --> 35:47.186
<i>right back here
and I can't do this again.</i>

35:47.186 --> 35:50.690
<i>It's just too painful.
Do you understand that?</i>

35:54.318 --> 35:56.445
<i>I'm not happy, Tess.</i>

35:56.445 --> 35:58.948
<i>soft, somber music</i>

36:09.500 --> 36:12.712
<i>Hey. Tess.
-</i>

36:21.470 --> 36:26.017
<i>No, I'm so sorry,
I can't do this back-and-forth.</i>

36:26.017 --> 36:29.478
<i>I just, I need to get off
this fucking ride.</i>

36:34.066 --> 36:36.736
Oh, my God! No.

36:36.736 --> 36:39.405
<i>Just not. Definitely.</i>

36:39.405 --> 36:41.532
<i>How do you even do that?</i>

36:43.075 --> 36:44.035
<i>Hmm.</i>

36:44.035 --> 36:47.038
Okay, uh.... let's see.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.372
<i>Oh, what about this one?</i>

36:48.372 --> 36:50.166
<i>Yeah, I like her.
- Yeah.</i>

36:51.292 --> 36:53.336
<i>She's all like, I'm cute,
I'm compact...</i>

36:53.336 --> 36:55.004
<i>And I get shit done.</i>

36:55.004 --> 36:57.381
<i>Sure.
- Yeah.</i>

36:57.381 --> 36:59.967
<i>Oh, God, you're hilarious.</i>

36:59.967 --> 37:01.052
<i>He's lucky to have you.</i>

37:01.052 --> 37:03.346
<i>Thanks, Bella.
- Mm.</i>

37:03.346 --> 37:06.349
<i>That's super sweet.
- Mm-hmm. [chuckles]</i>

37:06.349 --> 37:08.893
<i>Okay, purchased.</i>

37:08.893 --> 37:13.439
<i>Oh, I should get one, too.
- But, like, in different colors.</i>

37:13.981 --> 37:15.149
<i>So we don't mix them up.</i>

37:15.149 --> 37:17.985
Oh, my God.

37:17.985 --> 37:19.403
<i>Such a good call.</i>

37:19.403 --> 37:21.072
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

37:21.072 --> 37:24.784
<i>Yep, yep.
That is the right move.</i>

37:33.292 --> 37:35.378
Hey, Mack. Where's your mama?

37:35.378 --> 37:37.213
<i>Oh, my God.
- Shane?</i>

37:37.213 --> 37:39.340
<i>Oh, my God. Finley!</i>

37:39.340 --> 37:41.259
<i>Open, open the door,
open the door.</i>

37:41.259 --> 37:43.344
Hi, okay.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.516
<i>Hey.</i>

37:48.516 --> 37:51.769
<i>Oh, my God, I was wondering why
you weren't answering my texts.</i>

37:51.769 --> 37:53.729
Oh, God.

37:53.729 --> 37:57.608
<i>I, uh-- what happened?
- Thank you.</i>

38:01.529 --> 38:04.657
<i>I'm gonna get my stuff
and I'll take the dog.</i>

38:04.657 --> 38:07.743
<i>What? That's it?
You're just gonna go?</i>

38:08.995 --> 38:10.496
<i>Yeah.</i>

38:11.247 --> 38:14.583
<i>I don't know
what else to do, Tess.</i>

38:14.583 --> 38:17.628
<i>I can't keep hurting you, so...</i>

38:18.671 --> 38:21.465
<i>I think this is for the best.</i>

38:22.133 --> 38:24.135
<i>slow, somber music</i>

38:28.055 --> 38:30.016
Oh, my God.

38:37.064 --> 38:40.151
<i>I had a shit day, too.</i>

38:41.235 --> 38:43.279
<i>It's okay.</i>

38:43.279 --> 38:46.365
<i>Ready?
- Yeah.</i>

38:50.870 --> 38:53.205
<i>No fucking results?</i>

38:53.205 --> 38:56.042
You got to be kidding me.

38:58.252 --> 39:00.504
<i>Back to the Tupperware?</i>

39:02.089 --> 39:03.632
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:09.388 --> 39:11.932
<i>"Different" by Wild Story</i>

39:13.517 --> 39:16.645
<i>Keep trying to fit
inside the lines now</i>

39:16.645 --> 39:19.565
<i>What if we never do?</i>

39:19.565 --> 39:23.027
<i>Sick of standing
on the outside</i>

39:23.027 --> 39:24.987
<i>Of a crowded room</i>

<i>The great divide

will tell themselves</i>

<i>It's us that's the problem</i>

39:38.793 --> 39:41.670
<i>Sometimes it feels like</i>

39:41.670 --> 39:44.507
<i>Nobody is listening</i>

39:44.507 --> 39:47.676
<i>Sharks in the water</i>

39:47.676 --> 39:49.887
<i>But I just keep swimming</i>

39:49.887 --> 39:53.557
<i>We'll never fit in
with the rest</i>

39:53.557 --> 39:55.893
<i>We've all got monsters
under beds</i>

39:55.893 --> 39:58.979
<i>We'll never change it
-</i>

39:58.979 --> 40:03.275
<i>'Cause, darling,
we're different</i>

40:03.275 --> 40:06.362
<i>Would they notice
if we got lost?</i>

40:06.362 --> 40:08.989
<i>If we disappeared?</i>

40:08.989 --> 40:12.326
<i>Tell me right after
this rainstorm</i>

40:12.326 --> 40:14.745
<i>That the smoke will clear</i>

40:14.745 --> 40:16.247
<i>Looking at our dreams</i>

40:16.247 --> 40:18.499
<i>On movie screens
and magazines</i>

40:18.499 --> 40:20.626
Don't see a reflection

40:20.626 --> 40:22.086
<i>Could be somebody else</i>

40:22.086 --> 40:24.755
<i>But who the hell
will tell themselves</i>

40:24.755 --> 40:25.589
<i>Hey.</i>

40:25.589 --> 40:28.050
<i>It's us that's the problem</i>

40:28.050 --> 40:30.219
<i>Outside? Here?</i>

40:30.219 --> 40:32.263
<i>Now?</i>

40:32.263 --> 40:33.264
<i>Okay.</i>

40:33.264 --> 40:35.808
<i>We'll never change it</i>

40:35.808 --> 40:38.477
<i>'Cause, darling,
we're different</i>

40:43.315 --> 40:45.526
<i>Sorry I closed the bar early.</i>

40:45.526 --> 40:47.236
<i>It's fine.</i>

40:47.236 --> 40:49.447
<i>I'll pay you back
whatever I lost.</i>

40:49.447 --> 40:50.948
<i>I'm sure it wasn't much.</i>

40:50.948 --> 40:53.200
<i>Or you can just take it
out of my paycheck.</i>

40:53.200 --> 40:54.410
<i>But maybe not all at once.</i>

40:54.410 --> 40:57.371
<i>Or just do whatever
you think is best.</i>

40:58.372 --> 40:59.999
<i>It's fine.
- Also,</i>

40:59.999 --> 41:04.628
<i>we might owe the fire department
a couple thousand dollars.</i>

41:04.628 --> 41:06.797
But it was that or drink.

41:06.797 --> 41:09.925
<i>So I just thought it was best
to get the hell out of there.</i>

41:09.925 --> 41:12.136
<i>Mm.</i>

41:12.136 --> 41:15.181
<i>I'm talking because I felt like</i>

41:15.181 --> 41:19.643
<i>whatever happened
out there was bad,</i>

41:19.643 --> 41:24.523
<i>and I want to make it better,
but I don't know how to, so...</i>

41:24.523 --> 41:26.650
<i>gentle music</i>

41:35.493 --> 41:37.161
<i>We need to go to a meeting.</i>

41:37.161 --> 41:39.163
<i>Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

41:39.163 --> 41:43.417
<i>Um, let's go to a meeting.
- Okay, yeah, let's do that.</i>

41:43.417 --> 41:44.543
<i>Let's, um--
- That's a good idea.</i>

41:44.543 --> 41:46.378
<i>Yeah.
-</i>

41:49.465 --> 41:52.801
<i>All right.
We got ice cream.</i>

41:52.801 --> 41:55.971
<i>Mm-hmm.
- Popcorn. Here we go.</i>

41:55.971 --> 41:58.349
<i>Yeah, for sure.</i>

41:58.349 --> 42:00.809
<i>Oh. God.</i>

42:00.809 --> 42:04.313
<i>What happened tonight was...
- Oh, my gosh.</i>

42:04.313 --> 42:07.733
<i>It was... gay, so very gay.</i>

42:07.733 --> 42:09.527
<i>There really
aren't enough of us.</i>

42:09.527 --> 42:12.321
<i>Mm-mm. You know...</i>

42:12.321 --> 42:13.572
<i>you should hit them streets</i>

42:13.572 --> 42:14.990
<i>and start recruiting
some more people.</i>

42:14.990 --> 42:17.159
<i>I'm sure they'd sign up
in a heartbeat.</i>

42:18.369 --> 42:19.870
<i>Right.</i>

42:20.955 --> 42:22.414
<i>Mm.</i>

42:26.293 --> 42:28.754
<i>You know, I, um...</i>

42:29.588 --> 42:33.133
<i>I haven't really let myself
think about Dre since we met.</i>

42:33.968 --> 42:38.931
<i>God, we had the best
weekend together.</i>

42:38.931 --> 42:41.433
<i>It was like I was
in a different life</i>

42:41.433 --> 42:43.143
<i>for a minute or something.</i>

42:43.143 --> 42:45.229
<i>I can imagine.</i>

42:46.313 --> 42:47.565
<i>I don't have to imagine, actually.</i>

42:47.565 --> 42:51.777
<i>I have my own version of them
right up here.</i>

42:51.777 --> 42:55.614
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

42:55.614 --> 42:57.366
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

42:57.366 --> 43:01.036
<i>You know, if...
if you're into them</i>

43:01.036 --> 43:03.205
<i>and you wanna see
where it goes, like, don't--</i>

43:03.205 --> 43:04.248
<i>Mm. No.
- I'm--</i>

43:04.248 --> 43:06.208
<i>No, no, no, no.
No, no. No.</i>

43:06.208 --> 43:07.918
<i>I'm not gonna do that to you.</i>

43:07.918 --> 43:11.380
<i>You know me.
Loyal like a dog.</i>

43:12.673 --> 43:14.049
<i>Yeah.</i>

43:14.049 --> 43:15.259
<i>Mm!
- Hmm?</i>

43:15.259 --> 43:17.678
<i>We should watch the director's
cut of The Wedding Planner.</i>

43:17.678 --> 43:20.055
<i>Oh, my God. Yes, we should.
- Yes.</i>

43:20.055 --> 43:21.098
<i>And you know why?</i>

43:21.098 --> 43:23.058
<i>Because, you know,
it just makes me feel good</i>

43:23.058 --> 43:26.395
<i>knowing that J.Lo's heel
just so happens to be</i>

43:26.395 --> 43:29.815
<i>the exact same size
as a manhole cover hole.</i>

43:29.815 --> 43:30.983
<i>You remember that shit?</i>

43:30.983 --> 43:32.526
<i>That is what makes it
fate though.</i>

43:32.526 --> 43:34.069
<i>I know, it's fucking fate.
- It's fate.</i>

43:34.069 --> 43:36.071
Oh, wait, what does he say?

43:36.071 --> 43:38.324
"I have no idea

43:38.324 --> 43:41.702
<i>why you became
a wedding planner, Mary.</i>

43:41.702 --> 43:46.165
<i>But I know the curves
of your face.</i>

43:47.416 --> 43:51.712
<i>And I know every
fleck of gold in your eyes.</i>

43:51.712 --> 43:55.549
<i>And I know that that night
in the park</i>

43:55.549 --> 43:58.510
<i>was the best night I ever had."</i>

43:58.510 --> 43:59.720
<i>So good.</i>

43:59.720 --> 44:01.138
<i>Okay, you've definitely seen it
too many times.</i>

44:01.138 --> 44:03.932
<i>Oh, fuck, yeah.
Again and again and again.</i>

44:03.932 --> 44:07.853
<i>- By the way, he dies in the end.
- Come on, lady!</i>

44:07.853 --> 44:09.647
<i>Okay, stop.
I can't watch it anymore.</i>

44:09.647 --> 44:12.107
<i>Stop.
- Wow, they really turned on you.</i>

44:12.107 --> 44:15.319
<i>I know.</i>

44:15.319 --> 44:16.779
<i>Can you blame them?</i>

44:16.779 --> 44:19.239
<i>Okay, it wasn't
my finest moment.</i>

44:19.239 --> 44:20.783
You look insane.

44:20.783 --> 44:22.868
<i>Okay! Okay. Okay.</i>

44:22.868 --> 44:24.536
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

44:24.536 --> 44:26.747
<i>And it looks like I ate
both tubs of popcorn.</i>

44:26.747 --> 44:28.374
<i>Did you eat both popcorns?</i>

44:28.374 --> 44:30.459
<i>Well, yeah, I mean...</i>

44:30.459 --> 44:31.543
<i>Duh.</i>

44:31.543 --> 44:33.921
<i>All right.
-</i>

44:33.921 --> 44:38.634
<i>You know, it's not like it was
even right with Taylor...</i>

44:38.634 --> 44:40.928
<i>Or anyone lately.</i>

44:40.928 --> 44:46.058
<i>Do you ever think that
maybe this "not right" thing...</i>

44:46.975 --> 44:49.269
<i>...has more to do with you?</i>

44:49.269 --> 44:51.438
<i>No.
- No?</i>

44:51.438 --> 44:53.315
<i>Mm-mm.
- All right.</i>

44:57.528 --> 45:00.030
<i>You okay?</i>

45:00.030 --> 45:01.824
<i>No.</i>

45:01.824 --> 45:04.201
<i>No, no, I'm not. I'm not okay.</i>

45:04.201 --> 45:06.745
<i>I, uh...</i>

45:06.745 --> 45:08.747
<i>I ruined it.</i>

45:08.747 --> 45:11.834
<i>I ruined it. With Tess.</i>

45:11.834 --> 45:14.795
<i>No, she loves you.</i>

45:14.795 --> 45:17.423
<i>Yeah, but that's not enough.</i>

45:19.216 --> 45:20.968
<i>Well, look at us.</i>

45:20.968 --> 45:23.220
<i>Oh, yeah.
