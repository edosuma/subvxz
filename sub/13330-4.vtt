WEBVTT

00:07.807 --> 00:09.576
Here we go again.

00:10.043 --> 00:11.878
We're back, Geordie Shore.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.381
Bigger and better than ever.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.216
Bucking, birds and banter.

00:16.282 --> 00:17.517
I've got a boyfriend.

00:17.584 --> 00:18.618
New housemates.

00:18.685 --> 00:21.421
If there's new talent,
I've got first dibs.

00:21.488 --> 00:24.491
I grill more birds
than George Foreman. All reet?

00:24.557 --> 00:26.659
I'm young and I love bucking birds.

00:26.726 --> 00:28.361
(all) New boys!

00:28.428 --> 00:30.897
It's Vicky and Ricci's
engagement party.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.799
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

00:33.600 --> 00:35.468
(Charlotte) He's here.

00:35.535 --> 00:36.536
Fucking slag.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.004
Biggest argument ever.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.807
Engagement party's
been a fucking joke.

00:40.874 --> 00:44.544
(Anna) I've asked Vicky, Ricci
and Sophie to leave the house.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.447
Holly's going on her first date.

00:47.514 --> 00:48.982
What do I talk about?

00:49.048 --> 00:51.351
I'm better at blowjobs
than I am with words.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.286
Sophie, she's back.

00:53.887 --> 00:54.888
Yes.

00:54.954 --> 00:57.157
(Vicky) I cannot get down
quick enough.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.626
(Charlotte)
You could cut it with a knife.

00:59.692 --> 01:02.929
Charlotte has thought,
"What am I doing in Gary's bed?"

01:02.996 --> 01:04.330
This is a disaster.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.100
I apologise.
I don't accept. You're an arsehole.

01:07.167 --> 01:08.468
That went perfectly.

01:08.535 --> 01:10.703
Fat, washed-up
useless fucking bitch.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.305
When is this going to end?

01:12.839 --> 01:14.507
Where's the fucking fanny?

01:17.844 --> 01:20.280
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:20.346 --> 01:22.549
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:22.615 --> 01:24.851
If you look up "pulling",
I'm next to it.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.920
I'd not kiss a guy
without a six-pack.

01:26.986 --> 01:29.022
Get me in.
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:29.088 --> 01:31.024
I could talk the legs off a donkey.

01:31.090 --> 01:33.092
Got the looks, the charm.
Just works.

01:33.159 --> 01:35.462
I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:35.528 --> 01:37.397
The hardest graft I do is my hair.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.866
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:58.351 --> 01:59.819
She didn't suck him off.

01:59.886 --> 02:03.623
She didn't get her tits out.
She didn't brag about her tight hole.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.826
She didn't let his fingers
insert the tight hole.

02:07.794 --> 02:08.862
It's amazing.

02:08.928 --> 02:10.562
We were talking about shit.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.166
I couldn't tell you
what we talked about.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.134
I think they all just expected me

02:15.201 --> 02:17.937
to take him back to the house
and buck him.

02:18.004 --> 02:20.573
But they don't know about
hard-to-get Holly.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.909
She doesn't buck
on a first date any more.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.713
He was like, "So do I get a kiss
then?" And I was like, "OK."

02:27.714 --> 02:30.016
Did you neck on?
Necked on with him.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.886
I do want James to know
that I had a really good date,

02:32.952 --> 02:35.421
that I didn't fail,
that it wasn't awkward

02:35.488 --> 02:38.958
and I can actually do
these ladylike things like that.

02:39.025 --> 02:41.961
And that actually I am over him.

02:42.028 --> 02:44.497
Fucking hell,
she didn't even suck him off.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.533
I'm thinking, eh, you've changed.

02:46.599 --> 02:49.135
I didn't even take you on a date
and I got one.

02:49.936 --> 02:51.838
Sophie and me are barely speaking.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.706
In fact we're not speaking.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.909
Her apology to us was a joke.

02:55.975 --> 02:58.778
It wasn't the best but that is me

02:58.845 --> 03:01.581
and I don't know how to
be so soft and gentle.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.516
I want us to be friends.

03:03.583 --> 03:07.253
I'm sick of all this drama,
but I can't lick someone's arse.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.400
We decided to get out the house,
bit of fresh air

03:20.466 --> 03:22.268
and go for a game of five aside.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.940
I'm not gonna play, cos
I still don't wanna risk my knee.

03:27.006 --> 03:29.442
Last thing I want
is to be back on crutches

03:29.509 --> 03:31.744
and Nurse Holly
trying to jump in me bed.

03:31.811 --> 03:35.381
It's wicked to be out the house.
I'm not the best at football,

03:35.448 --> 03:37.050
but I'll have a frisk.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.720
(James) Scott! Scott's useless.

03:40.787 --> 03:43.723
Scott all day banging on about
how good he is at this,

03:43.790 --> 03:45.224
how good he is at that.

03:45.291 --> 03:48.561
Gets on the football pitch,
he's like fucking Bambi on ice.

03:49.362 --> 03:50.663
Oh, my God.

03:51.664 --> 03:54.934
Scott is just running around
like Big Bird.

03:55.001 --> 03:59.606
He's got no coordination whatsoever.
Big dangly arms, big dangly legs.

03:59.672 --> 04:01.441
Just getting in everyone's way.

04:01.507 --> 04:04.611
Scott plays how he dances.
Kid's got two left feet.

04:04.677 --> 04:07.981
What's happening with this, erm...
with this bird?

04:08.047 --> 04:10.183
I've told all the lads
about this girl.

04:10.249 --> 04:13.786
They're all telling us I should go
meet her, I should go on a date.

04:13.853 --> 04:16.322
But I'm thinking, to be honest,

04:16.389 --> 04:20.560
the success rate of relationships
in Geordie Shore is fucking zero.

04:20.627 --> 04:22.862
I'm gonna give her a ring today.
Are you?

04:22.929 --> 04:25.465
Aye. I wouldn't mind meeting her.
You should.

04:25.531 --> 04:28.901
You tell us you've got
a bit of feelings for this girl.

04:28.968 --> 04:32.538
I'm buzzing to see her, like.
I wanna see her tonight, aye.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.174
See, everyone's fucking
getting loved up.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.612
We know one person
that'll not get fucking loved up.

04:39.679 --> 04:40.813
(laughs)

04:40.880 --> 04:43.316
Gaz'll always be single.
Single forever.

04:47.754 --> 04:49.088
All the lads get on well,

04:49.155 --> 04:51.691
but there's still a divide
between the girls.

04:59.232 --> 05:03.069
When Sophie and Vicky aren't speaking
it does create a massive divide.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.239
If Vicky's with the girls
then Sophie comes with the lads

05:06.305 --> 05:09.742
but so does Ricci, and Ricci
and Sophie don't like each other.

05:09.809 --> 05:13.012
So then if Sophie's talking to
the girls then Vicky can't.

05:13.079 --> 05:16.015
So Vicky's back with Ricci
and there's three groups.

05:16.082 --> 05:19.919
It is just so fucking confusing
and it needs sorting out ASAP.

05:25.124 --> 05:27.727
Charlotte, what the hell
are you doing in here?

05:27.794 --> 05:30.697
I've been looking for you,
shouting your name.

05:30.763 --> 05:34.300
It's a while since I spoke to Scott.
I need to tell him about Gary.

05:34.367 --> 05:38.004
I can't tell him over the phone.
I just couldn't do that to someone.

05:38.071 --> 05:41.641
I need to tell him face to face,
the mature grown-up way to do it.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.777
I'm going to tell him
that I got into Gary's bed.

05:44.844 --> 05:48.381
Oh, shit. Have you thought about
how you're gonna say it?

05:48.448 --> 05:52.485
I don't even know how to get...
I don't even know how to start it.

05:52.552 --> 05:56.456
I don't know when to bring it up.
I don't know how he's gonna react.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.124
Charlotte's so nervous

05:58.191 --> 06:01.728
cos she knows she has to tell Scott
about what happened with Gaz.

06:01.794 --> 06:04.931
She building it up so, so much
that she's freaking out

06:04.997 --> 06:06.766
and she's getting stressed.

06:06.833 --> 06:12.105
Knowing Scott, he doesn't take a good
liking to things like that, does he,

06:12.171 --> 06:14.307
especially when it's to do with Gary.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.309
I'm so scared, you know.

06:16.375 --> 06:17.977
Make it sound just innocent.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.247
How the fuck do you make that
sound innocent? I don't know.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.249
I'm so bad at these situations.

06:23.316 --> 06:26.018
I'm so scared.
I don't know how he's gonna react.

06:26.085 --> 06:29.489
This is the first time
I've seen him since the party.

06:30.389 --> 06:31.958
(exhales)

06:32.024 --> 06:33.392
So stressful.

06:33.993 --> 06:35.428
Have fun.

06:35.495 --> 06:36.763
Have fun?

06:36.829 --> 06:38.531
Bye.
Bye.

06:42.268 --> 06:44.170
I'm so scared.

06:48.207 --> 06:49.575
(opens canned drink)

06:55.047 --> 06:58.785
I'm gonna call Kate, the girl
I was telling the lads about.

06:58.851 --> 07:02.121
I feel like a kid at Christmas
waiting to open his toys.

07:02.188 --> 07:03.956
(line rings)

07:05.958 --> 07:08.094
"Hello."
Hello.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.663
"Hello?"
Hi, you all right?

07:10.730 --> 07:12.799
"Yeah, are you?"
Oh, good, good.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.401
Do you wanna see us?
I really wanna see you.

07:16.202 --> 07:18.037
"Yeah, I do."
Good.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.640
Do you wanna meet us in town later?

07:20.706 --> 07:22.108
"Erm, yeah."

07:22.175 --> 07:25.178
I'm missing you here, you know.
I'm dying to see you.

07:25.244 --> 07:26.345
(laughs)

07:26.412 --> 07:30.049
I've done the phone call. It may have
been a bit awkward but fuck it.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.519
It's gonna be my first proper date
in the Geordie Shore house.

07:33.586 --> 07:36.422
I was nervous there for some reason.
I'm never.

07:36.489 --> 07:39.525
What did you say? I'm gonna meet her
later on for a drink.

07:39.592 --> 07:41.561
I'm buzzing, like. I can't wait.

07:41.627 --> 07:45.364
Never ever been like this before.
Are you gonna bring her out?

07:45.431 --> 07:48.668
Hopefully, like. I wanna be
looking me best for the night.

07:48.734 --> 07:51.370
I might do another little
tricep workout.

07:51.437 --> 07:53.573
Pulling out all the stops.
Get in, son.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.880
Part of looking me best,
get me eyebrows done.

08:00.947 --> 08:03.683
So I'm taking Gaz with us
cos I'm sick of looking at

08:03.749 --> 08:06.485
them two fucking
hairy caterpillars on his face.

08:06.552 --> 08:08.621
I've not had mine done
for four weeks.

08:08.688 --> 08:11.424
That's the longest
I've not had them done for.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.926
How do you think
Charlotte and Scott will go?

08:13.993 --> 08:16.462
Oh, God, I feel a bit sorry for him,
you know.

08:16.529 --> 08:19.565
I think she's still into you,
trying to get in your bed.

08:19.632 --> 08:22.368
I think it will do her
the world of good to go see him

08:22.435 --> 08:25.238
and sort something out,
but it wasn't a random lad,

08:25.304 --> 08:28.741
it was me. After everything we've
been through, it'll kill him.

08:28.808 --> 08:31.811
Do you think she'll tell him?
She said she's gonna.

08:31.878 --> 08:36.215
Did she? Oh, I think, he'll, like...
That will be another step for him.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.484
Like, he will kick off about that,
like.

08:38.551 --> 08:43.489
I don't know how he'll take this cos
I know if it was me, I'd kick off.

08:43.556 --> 08:46.792
So where's the hedge trimmer stashed?
Is it under the bed?

08:47.593 --> 08:48.628
(whimpers)

08:48.694 --> 08:52.031
I'm looking at him
and he looks like he's gonna cry.

08:53.232 --> 08:55.768
Oh, you fucker.
(laughs)

08:55.835 --> 08:57.970
Eyebrow waxing fucking hurts, right.

08:58.037 --> 09:01.908
James gets it done every couple of
weeks. Fuck that for a laugh.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.745
Having a banter and I think,

09:05.811 --> 09:08.214
it has been a while
since I've pulled.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.883
The longest I've gone
without banging is a week

09:10.950 --> 09:12.919
and we're coming up to that mark.

09:15.321 --> 09:17.490
So I need to get me banging boots
back on.

09:20.726 --> 09:21.861
Sorted.

09:21.928 --> 09:24.297
Oh, my God, what the bloody hell?

09:24.363 --> 09:26.999
He looks more feminine
than my vagina.

09:27.934 --> 09:31.437
Absolute nightmare. He just looks
in a constant state of shock.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.641
Ricci's gonna cut me hair for us.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.977
He knows
I'm looking forward to tonight.

09:38.044 --> 09:40.479
So just let's hope
he doesn't fuck it up.

09:40.546 --> 09:43.082
Had me eyebrows done,
get me hair cut.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.617
Whack a shirt on.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.819
Like fucking slick Rick tonight.

09:46.886 --> 09:52.491
James is getting absolutely dolled
to the nines for this girl tonight.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.566
It makes me jealous because
he was never like that with me.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.370
Bet you're having this conversation
with me one day.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.838
I dunno, like.

10:06.572 --> 10:07.807
Aye, in your 70s.

10:07.873 --> 10:10.109
James says he's not
the best at pulling.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.411
He's got a bird,
he's gonna hold on to her.

10:12.478 --> 10:14.180
But, for me, fuck that.

10:14.246 --> 10:17.083
It's just fucking way too fun
single.

10:17.750 --> 10:21.153
All right, that's your hair
fucked up then, mate. Aw, cheers.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.130
All right? You can get up
and give us a hug if you want.

10:31.797 --> 10:32.798
All right?

10:32.865 --> 10:35.701
I walk in and there he is
sitting at the table

10:35.768 --> 10:38.337
and me heart is just beating so fast.

10:38.404 --> 10:41.807
I know what I've got to tell him
and he hasn't got a clue.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.645
We're talking and it's so awkward

10:46.712 --> 10:50.149
and I'm just so fucking scared.

10:56.589 --> 11:00.626
I don't know how I'm gonna bring up
the fact I got into Gary's bed.

11:25.084 --> 11:28.954
It's not looking good.
I can tell in his eyes he's so angry.

11:33.926 --> 11:38.197
Scott is getting up to leave and he
doesn't wanna be with us any more.

11:42.368 --> 11:45.371
I'm thinking, how did I not know
this was gonna happen?

11:45.438 --> 11:47.973
Obviously it was.
He wasn't just gonna think,

11:48.040 --> 11:50.743
"Oh, that's fine,
let's just get on with things."

11:51.677 --> 11:55.214
I'm so disappointed in me self.
I can't believe it.

11:55.281 --> 11:59.452
And at this minute in time I know for
a fine fact this isn't what I want.

12:00.286 --> 12:01.787
And it's just because

12:01.854 --> 12:04.824
I don't know how to be a girlfriend.

12:10.029 --> 12:12.998
It hadn't sunk in.
I'm still in shock.

12:13.065 --> 12:16.669
It all ends in tears
cos Gary's in the way.

12:16.735 --> 12:19.038
You and Sophie have to go to work.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.840
I already feel hung over.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.542
The last thing I need
is to be anywhere near her.

12:23.609 --> 12:24.810
There we go.

12:24.877 --> 12:28.314
I've never made this much effort
for a bird in me life.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.184
I need to bang someone tonight.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.920
Someone is definitely getting
hashtag Gazzed.

12:34.987 --> 12:37.323
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:54.240 --> 12:56.308
We're getting ready for the night out

12:56.375 --> 12:58.611
and I can't wait
for Charlotte to come in.

12:58.677 --> 13:01.780
I'm hoping so much that everything
went perfect for her

13:01.847 --> 13:03.716
cos she was so, so worried.

13:04.884 --> 13:08.454
But she comes through the door
and it's not a happy face.

13:09.188 --> 13:11.056
Oh, Jesus.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.225
Oh, my God. What's happened?

13:15.594 --> 13:16.929
It hasn't sunk in.

13:16.996 --> 13:21.934
I'm still in shock and I feel like
everything's just a blur.

13:28.707 --> 13:31.844
It's horrible to see her this way.
I don't know what to say

13:31.911 --> 13:34.747
cos being in this house
tears relationships apart.

13:34.813 --> 13:39.118
Unless you're really strong or
really dedicated or really in love,

13:39.185 --> 13:42.188
there's too much temptation
to make something work.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.697
I think Charlotte right now
has got the relationship curse.

13:51.764 --> 13:55.000
It's not gonna go well.
It never does for Charlotte.

13:55.067 --> 13:58.604
No matter what boy she gets with,
it all ends in tears,

13:58.671 --> 14:01.307
and it's all because
Gary's in the way.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.816
Ricci comes in, tells us about
Charlotte meeting Scott,

14:10.883 --> 14:13.485
and says they're finished.
I was like, "What?"

14:13.552 --> 14:17.356
She told him about trying to get in
bed and I knew that would go tits up.

14:22.561 --> 14:24.196
I do feel sorry for Charlotte.

14:24.263 --> 14:27.900
I do wanna comfort her but I don't
want her to get any feelings back

14:27.967 --> 14:29.401
or think I'm... You know?

14:29.468 --> 14:32.605
It is hard to comfort someone
when they've been finished

14:32.671 --> 14:36.675
when they got finished cos of you.
It's a fucked-up situation again.

14:40.079 --> 14:43.549
Charlotte, we're all out tonight,
man, we're all cheer you up.

14:43.616 --> 14:44.783
Yeah.

14:44.850 --> 14:47.119
I am not letting that girl
sit in alone.

14:47.186 --> 14:49.121
She's coming out with us to party.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.638
Bye.

15:13.545 --> 15:15.948
I'm looking good.
I'm feeling good.

15:16.015 --> 15:19.852
Fuck me, I've never made this
much effort for a bird in me life.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.254
I'm a little bit nervous.

15:22.321 --> 15:25.724
I've never been this bothered
about a girl having a good time.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.661
Hello. How you doing?

15:28.727 --> 15:31.096
Other than when me cock was up her.

15:31.163 --> 15:34.867
I mean, going out now, I'm not
looking in the club for girls,

15:34.933 --> 15:36.168
I'm looking for you.

15:36.235 --> 15:38.971
Seeing Kate again
has definitely made us realise

15:39.038 --> 15:40.906
I don't wanna be like Scott or Gaz.

15:40.973 --> 15:44.243
I don't wanna run around Newcastle
chasing minging birds

15:44.310 --> 15:45.644
when I've got a worldie.

15:49.214 --> 15:51.116
(urban music)

15:58.624 --> 16:00.859
(Sophie)
We all wanna get on it so badly.

16:00.926 --> 16:04.396
We wanna get drunk.
Let our hair down, enjoy the music.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.199
It's Koos and it is
a really good night.

16:09.768 --> 16:13.505
But when I look over at Charlotte,
she doesn't seem drunk.

16:13.572 --> 16:16.241
Charlotte isn't herself.
She's not drinking,

16:16.308 --> 16:19.278
there's no big smile on her face.
She's devastated.

16:22.047 --> 16:26.118
If I get drunk I'll cry and probably
end up smashing something.

16:26.185 --> 16:29.722
# OWL CITY &amp; CARLY RAE JEPSEN:
Good Time

16:29.788 --> 16:31.490
# Whoa-oh-oh

16:31.557 --> 16:34.093
# It's always a good time

16:34.159 --> 16:37.696
# Whoa-oh-oh... #

16:37.763 --> 16:39.598
(cheering)

16:41.333 --> 16:42.868
Everyone's having a dance,

16:42.935 --> 16:45.504
and James comes in
with a big smile on his face.

16:45.571 --> 16:48.273
So I'm guessing his date went well
and he's happy.

16:52.044 --> 16:55.047
I've had a mint night,
but I still don't think I'm ready

16:55.114 --> 16:57.449
to introduce Kate
to the rest of the house.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.718
I don't know how the lasses
will take it.

16:59.785 --> 17:01.987
So I think I'm gonna wait
a bit longer.

17:07.559 --> 17:10.229
Vicky and Sophie
kicking off with each other.

17:10.295 --> 17:12.731
Does my head in.
I can't be arsed with drama.

17:12.798 --> 17:13.866
I hate whinging.

17:20.439 --> 17:22.374
I'm coming close to that week mark.

17:22.441 --> 17:24.376
I need to bang someone tonight.

17:24.443 --> 17:27.512
Someone is definitely getting
hashtag Gazzed.

17:29.281 --> 17:32.284
Me and Scott hit the dance floor,
whacking shapes out.

17:32.351 --> 17:35.220
Out the corner of me eye
spy the bird from Mr Lynch's.

17:35.287 --> 17:37.756
Blondie I put the graft in
the other night with.

17:40.993 --> 17:45.164
She's looking fucking mint.
Blonde, pretty, good banter.

17:45.230 --> 17:48.434
I'm just thinking, "Come on, Gaz,
seal the fucking deal."

17:51.837 --> 17:54.807
She's not a pig.
She's actually a nice-looking bird

17:54.873 --> 17:56.575
with a decent bit of banter.

17:57.276 --> 18:01.079
It must be his fucking brows.
Get in, you browsy bastard.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.785
Had an amazing night,
and I'm leaving with her.

18:06.852 --> 18:08.353
Couldn't have went better.

18:15.160 --> 18:18.530
If you weren't pissed you'd have
the Hoover out and that.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.936
The graft's been put in,
she's back at the house.

18:24.002 --> 18:27.973
She's fit, banter's flowing. I'm
buzzing. It's been nearly a week.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.376
I'm walking into the bungalow,
she's taking her clothes off

18:31.443 --> 18:32.945
and I fucking fall asleep.

18:33.011 --> 18:34.947
(snores)
Fucking kidding us.

18:46.425 --> 18:48.427
Last night was good.
(Dan) So tired.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.175
I've not been in the house that long

19:03.242 --> 19:05.511
and even I know
Charlotte's talking shit.

19:16.121 --> 19:19.258
Shock. I'm fucking cooking
everyone breakfast again.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.426
And probably cleaning up after.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.828
Liberty.

19:24.663 --> 19:28.767
What better way to start a morning
than with a sausage in your mouth?

19:33.472 --> 19:36.275
How'd your drinks go
with your special lady?

19:36.875 --> 19:38.310
Mint. Aye, mint, mate.

19:41.446 --> 19:43.615
(phone rings)
I'm not answering that.

19:48.587 --> 19:52.491
Oh, I'm not going to work.
(Charlotte) I'm ringing in sick.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.526
Hello.
"Hello. Good morning."

19:54.593 --> 19:56.361
Hi! Is that Anna?
"It's Anna."

19:56.428 --> 19:58.564
Hiya.
"We have got work this morning."

19:58.630 --> 20:01.567
So the phone rings and I answer it

20:01.633 --> 20:03.535
and it's bloody Anna

20:03.602 --> 20:06.305
and obviously it's going to be work.

20:06.371 --> 20:10.509
One of the names is Vicky
and the other name is me.

20:10.576 --> 20:13.045
Okie doke, see you later. Bye.
"Bye."

20:13.111 --> 20:16.181
Oh, my days, this is going to be

20:16.248 --> 20:20.118
the worst, worst shift
I've ever done in my life.

20:20.185 --> 20:22.321
How can I work with someone

20:22.387 --> 20:26.458
that will not verbally speak to us?

20:26.525 --> 20:29.494
Or even make a tiny bit
of eye contact.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.129
I'm dreading this.

20:32.664 --> 20:35.734
Sophie and Vicky haven't said
two words to each other.

20:35.801 --> 20:39.404
I understand why Vicky's pissed off,
but for the sake of the house

20:39.471 --> 20:42.007
they need to bite the bullet
and get on with it.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.743
Scramble and egg
have had more crack than them two.

20:45.344 --> 20:48.313
Vicky, you and Sophie
have gotta go to work.

20:50.515 --> 20:51.717
Have fun.

20:51.783 --> 20:55.120
Anna has got a salon and I find out
I'm at work with Sophie.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.888
I know it's gonna be awkward.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.357
I already feel hung over.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.726
Last thing I need
is to be anywhere near her.

21:00.792 --> 21:02.260
She gave us a shit apology.

21:02.327 --> 21:04.863
She's swanning about
like she owns the place.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.498
She's getting on me tits.

21:06.565 --> 21:10.636
I don't want to be near her,
especially not in an enclosed space.

21:12.504 --> 21:15.140
(James) See youse all soon.
Tidy the bedroom.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.509
(laughs)
(Dan) Wash your fanny.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.683
I'll show you what you're doing.

21:24.750 --> 21:27.653
I get sent into the laundry room
with Vicky

21:27.719 --> 21:29.955
to fold bastard towels.

21:32.357 --> 21:37.029
Today has been totally pleasurable.
Myself and Sophie have spoke loads.

21:37.095 --> 21:40.332
We are great friends again.
She's really nice to be around.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.834
I love folding towels. Hmm!

21:45.037 --> 21:48.306
I want to apologise to her again
but I'm just so scared

21:48.373 --> 21:50.976
that she's gonna chuck it back
in me face again.

21:52.277 --> 21:54.346
It's shit, it's not fair on anybody.

21:54.413 --> 21:56.348
Not fair on me and not fair on her.

21:56.415 --> 21:59.117
We just need to bite the bullet
and be mates again.

21:59.184 --> 22:02.120
But I can't bring meself
to say sorry again.

22:02.187 --> 22:05.524
I feel like I've left it for so long,
it's build up and build up

22:05.590 --> 22:08.126
and I'm making more of an issue
than what it is.

22:08.193 --> 22:10.629
There's no love lost
between me and Sophie.

22:10.696 --> 22:14.399
I still think she's a little twit.
So, no, we're not talking.

22:14.466 --> 22:17.102
I'm just folding fucking towels
like a twat.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.503
There we go.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.809
Charlotte, Gary, burger van tonight.

22:23.875 --> 22:26.211
This is one thing I never wanted.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.280
I never wanted it to get awkward.

22:30.248 --> 22:35.654
Dan is in the club when Holly
looks like a total minger.

22:35.721 --> 22:39.591
They are touching places that should
only be touched in the bedroom.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.294
This is the drunkest I've ever been.

22:43.795 --> 22:46.331
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:59.845 --> 23:01.480
Not putting any pants on?
Nah.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.882
You've got a shirt on
with just underwear.

23:03.949 --> 23:07.352
That's what I had on last night.
Have you got knickers on? Yep.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.321
Oh, my God.

23:12.591 --> 23:17.095
Scott has taken over the role
of being daddy of the house

23:17.162 --> 23:20.732
and cooking all the time
and cleaning up and tidying.

23:20.799 --> 23:23.668
We'll get food
cos there's nee scran in the house.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.971
I feel like
I've lost me role a little bit

23:26.037 --> 23:27.773
and I don't know where to stand.

23:27.839 --> 23:30.609
I'm a bit upset
cos I thought that used to be me.

23:30.675 --> 23:34.146
We'll get a massive shop in.
Get a fuck load of meat.

23:34.212 --> 23:38.116
So I think, "No, you are not taking
this role, I'm coming with you."

23:44.923 --> 23:47.526
Rock up at this food shop,
lasses are loving it.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.861
Right up their street.
Kebab.

23:49.928 --> 23:52.264
Nah, not a chance.
That looks horrible.

23:52.330 --> 23:54.800
Why? Do you really want to eat that?
Yes.

23:54.866 --> 23:58.170
You told me, "Don't let me eat
any shit." Boneless banquet.

23:58.236 --> 24:02.808
This is my type of supermarket.
They've got doner meat in a box.

24:02.874 --> 24:05.043
They've got lamb curry in a box.

24:05.110 --> 24:08.246
They've got chips and curry
in a box.

24:08.313 --> 24:11.016
Put it in.
Oh, my God.

24:11.082 --> 24:13.518
I don't even wanna touch it.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.720
The lasses bang on
about being on diets

24:15.787 --> 24:17.722
and they whinge about their weight.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.090
Two minutes in the shop

24:19.157 --> 24:22.294
and they stuff kebabs and chips
in the fucking trolley.

24:22.360 --> 24:25.197
Peperami.
Oh, they're the wide ones.

24:25.263 --> 24:26.531
Wide Boys.

24:26.598 --> 24:29.801
It is mad in the house, cos the lads,
we eat well, go the gym,

24:29.868 --> 24:31.136
look after ourselves.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.138
The girls couldn't give a fuck.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.608
They will just eat shit,
go round with their tits hanging out.

24:36.675 --> 24:38.343
They just don't care at all.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.345
(gasps) Meatballs.

24:40.412 --> 24:43.181
Get rid of them, get rid of them.

24:43.248 --> 24:45.250
Shut it.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.384
We are snipers.

24:46.451 --> 24:48.320
They take my fucking stuff out.

24:48.386 --> 24:51.122
We'll have these back.

24:57.495 --> 25:01.066
Charlotte, they're your usual ones.
Want me to get them for you?

25:02.534 --> 25:04.536
She does actually need nappies.

25:04.603 --> 25:08.640
I can count, like, four times now
when she's pissed or shit somewhere.

25:08.707 --> 25:12.010
What is hard about going to
the toilet? I'll make her a potty.

25:16.281 --> 25:17.682
(burps)

25:17.749 --> 25:19.184
(phone rings)

25:21.319 --> 25:23.455
Hello.
"It's Anna."

25:33.131 --> 25:36.167
All right, no problem.
Thanks, Anna. Bye.

25:40.005 --> 25:42.507
Charlotte.
(Charlotte) Oh, fuck off.

25:42.574 --> 25:45.343
Gary. Mortal Meats
burger van tonight.

25:45.410 --> 25:47.746
Burger van?

25:47.812 --> 25:49.948
Anna's called
and we're going to work,

25:50.015 --> 25:51.349
but it's something new.

25:51.416 --> 25:54.119
We're not spray tanning
and we're not massaging.

25:54.185 --> 25:56.321
We're going to work in a burger van.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.589
Nightmare.

25:57.656 --> 26:01.359
With everything that's going on,
the last place I want to go is work.

26:01.426 --> 26:04.496
Especially with Charlotte,
especially in a burger van.

26:05.563 --> 26:06.564
Charlotte.

26:06.631 --> 26:09.701
Gary is the last person on Earth
I want to spend time with

26:09.768 --> 26:12.971
because he's the reason
me and Scott have finished. Bye.

26:13.038 --> 26:19.044
To make things worse, I'm going
to work in a stupid blue cap

26:19.110 --> 26:22.247
and a silly blue polo shirt
with a name badge.

26:22.314 --> 26:25.183
I look like I'm going to
some dodgy Smurf PE class.

Buzzing to go out tonight.
Nightmare for Gaz. He's at work.

26:36.795 --> 26:40.365
Lost me wingman, but I'll still do
damage for the both of us.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.301
Charlotte's not going to have
any time to get ready,

26:43.368 --> 26:45.136
so as such good friends as we are

26:45.203 --> 26:47.639
we decide we're gonna go out
like tramps.

26:49.207 --> 26:52.677
With me and Sophie not speaking,
I'm feeling a little bit down.

26:52.744 --> 26:55.080
Doesn't feel like
I'll be able to have fun.

26:55.146 --> 26:59.050
I'd rather not ruin everyone's night
so I think it's best if I stay in.

26:59.117 --> 27:03.655
I hope to God that Vicky and Sophie
finally give in, make up

27:03.722 --> 27:05.790
and then we can all be together
again.

27:18.703 --> 27:22.240
The conversation with me and Gary
is very little,

27:22.307 --> 27:24.476
very inadequate, very awkward.

27:25.210 --> 27:28.813
This is one thing I never wanted.
I never wanted it to get awkward.

27:29.447 --> 27:34.719
I told Scott about...
about how I got in your bed.

27:34.786 --> 27:36.121
Did ya?

27:36.187 --> 27:39.524
The last thing you want is
your girlfriend in someone's bed.

27:39.591 --> 27:41.893
Even if I got out,
what was her intention?

27:41.960 --> 27:44.429
You were pissed,
you crawled into bed

27:44.496 --> 27:47.132
and I got out. Nothing happened.
I told him that.

27:47.198 --> 27:49.401
I do love that girl to bits
as a friend.

27:49.467 --> 27:51.836
I care about her
and I want her to be happy.

28:02.347 --> 28:05.817
Hit Florita's and it's dead.
Slim pickings, there's no girls.

28:05.884 --> 28:08.720
It's international night.
I was expecting fitties

28:08.787 --> 28:10.789
from different countries. No-one.

28:12.791 --> 28:14.025
We get in this club.

28:14.092 --> 28:16.928
There's absolutely no fucking talent
whatsoever.

28:16.995 --> 28:21.399
Best-looking bird is the glass
collector and it's a boy anyway.

28:24.469 --> 28:28.206

I'm an onion

28:28.273 --> 28:32.010
# And I'm lying on a grill
I'm an onion... #

28:32.077 --> 28:34.345
All of a sudden
the mood starts changing.

28:34.412 --> 28:37.482
We are getting on, we are friends,
we are having a laugh.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.850
It actually felt nice.

28:39.517 --> 28:42.187
Please do that properly.
Ready, ready, go on.

28:42.253 --> 28:44.622
I've never laughed so much in ages.

28:44.689 --> 28:46.524
(both laugh)

28:55.800 --> 29:00.371
After work I'm literally stinking of
onion, burgers, fucking everything.

29:00.438 --> 29:02.807
I've got a weird hat on.
My hair's not done.

29:02.874 --> 29:05.643
For once I just cannot be arsed.

29:05.710 --> 29:06.978
Where's Char?

29:07.045 --> 29:10.348
She's gone to meet them,
dressed like this.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.783
I stink of onions.

We're raving, we've got trainers on.
Letting our hair down.

29:25.230 --> 29:28.133
We're having a mint night,
then Charlotte rocks up,

29:28.199 --> 29:30.602
fucking looking like
she's in fancy dress

29:30.668 --> 29:32.137
as a sweaty dinner nanny.

in flats, hair in scraggy buns.

29:41.279 --> 29:44.916
And I'm like, "Yes! This is going
to be such a good night!"

29:46.751 --> 29:50.188
# Eh, sexy lady... #

29:52.157 --> 29:55.160
I'm out, I'm dancing
and everyone can notice

29:55.226 --> 29:58.930
that I stink of onions and grease
and cheesy burgers.

29:58.997 --> 30:01.933
She normally smells of fanny
so it's an improvement.

30:10.041 --> 30:11.709
Oh, my God,

30:11.776 --> 30:16.047
Dan is in the club
when Holly looks like a total minger.

30:21.085 --> 30:23.121
Have you seen
the fucking state of us?

30:23.188 --> 30:24.923
Just my fucking luck.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.258
I go out like a tramp

30:27.325 --> 30:31.196
and I look round and who's there.
Dan, for fuck's sake.

30:36.801 --> 30:39.904
Now I'm like,
"Whoa, I look like a tramp

30:39.971 --> 30:42.040
and he still fancies us."

30:42.106 --> 30:44.309
Like, he might actually
like me for me.

30:45.210 --> 30:46.344
Holly seems buzzing

30:46.411 --> 30:49.280
even though she's come out
dressed like a scruff.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.417
But I'm happy for her.
I'm glad she's finally moving on.

30:52.483 --> 30:54.586
They are touching each other

30:54.652 --> 30:57.822
places that should only be touched
in the bedroom.

30:57.889 --> 31:00.892
Little does he know that
I'm still hard-to-get Holly.

31:00.959 --> 31:03.928
There's not a chance
that I'm gonna suck him off yet.

31:12.604 --> 31:15.240
I get home absolutely mortal,

31:15.306 --> 31:18.343
making Sunday dinners
at daft o'clock in the morning.

31:18.409 --> 31:20.812
I'm in bed and I don't think
any drunk person

31:20.878 --> 31:22.780
realises how much noise they make

31:22.847 --> 31:27.518
but there's fucking pans clattering,
voices shrieking, and I'm awake.

31:27.585 --> 31:31.122
Surprisingly, Charlotte
is the drunkest.

31:31.990 --> 31:34.158
This is the drunkest I've ever been.

31:37.362 --> 31:40.098
Do you want to come
and try wedding dresses on?

31:40.164 --> 31:43.268
I wanna be there but I'm not
because of this argument.

31:43.334 --> 31:45.136
Oh, my God. I feel emotional.

31:45.203 --> 31:48.172
It's a black cloud
over everything that makes us happy.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.575
(they hum "Wedding March")

31:50.642 --> 31:52.043
Just do it, Sophie.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.746
She's got an apology in mind
but I'm not ready.

31:54.812 --> 31:56.447
Vicky, please, man.

31:56.514 --> 31:57.882
(cheering)

31:57.949 --> 31:59.784
I haven't got a care in the world.

31:59.851 --> 32:02.787
Next thing, the girl
who James fancies walks in.

32:02.854 --> 32:05.123

32:19.837 --> 32:20.972
(doorbell rings)

32:21.039 --> 32:25.009
So the doorbell goes.
Who on earth could it be?

32:25.076 --> 32:26.944
We're not expecting anyone.

32:28.346 --> 32:31.182
Hiya, how you doing?
I'm all right. How are you?

32:31.249 --> 32:35.286
I'm Scott. Pleased to meet you,
Scott, I'm Kevin, Sophie's dad.

32:35.353 --> 32:40.825
And there he is coming to greet
his young children once again.

32:42.226 --> 32:45.330
The godfather of all
Geordie Shores.

32:45.396 --> 32:47.131
It's my dad.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.768
He always knows
how to make an entrance

32:50.835 --> 32:53.905
and he even walks in
on Vicky and Ricci shagging.

32:55.306 --> 32:56.541
(Ricci) Yeah.

32:56.607 --> 32:58.109
(Vicky) Come in.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.446
Hiya. (laughs)
Hi.

33:01.512 --> 33:03.748
Last thing I want
is for Sophie's dad

33:03.815 --> 33:05.717
to come bursting through the door,

33:05.783 --> 33:09.987
with his fucking fake Italian accent
and ruin me moment.

33:10.054 --> 33:12.490
Thanks a lot, Kev, you fucking tit.

33:12.557 --> 33:15.026
Listen, you've all been good

33:15.093 --> 33:19.364
so I've decided to invite you to
Mambo's for a night out for a meal.

33:19.430 --> 33:22.700
What he wants is for us all
to go to his restaurant, Mambo's,

33:22.767 --> 33:26.604
and have a really good family meal.
But when me dad tells us this

33:26.671 --> 33:29.307
I know that the storm's
still hanging above us.

33:29.374 --> 33:31.776
I know that Ricci and Vicky
are not speaking

33:31.843 --> 33:34.712
and I don't even know
if they'll probably come.

33:40.451 --> 33:44.722
We've had an idea. Do you want to
come try wedding dresses on today?

33:45.790 --> 33:47.358
After how I've been feeling

33:47.425 --> 33:52.797
the last thing I want to do
is go shopping for me wedding dress.

33:53.531 --> 33:55.400
I didn't know where to put meself.

33:55.466 --> 33:59.036
Vicky and Sophie aren't talking,
so it means Sophie can't come.

33:59.837 --> 34:01.372
I feel shit cos I thought

34:01.439 --> 34:04.842
the first time Vicky tries on
a wedding dress I wanna be there.

34:04.909 --> 34:07.345
But I'm not because of
this stupid argument.

34:08.012 --> 34:11.616
And I'm lying in bed by meself and
I think, "You know what, Sophie,

34:11.681 --> 34:16.053
fuck this, we need to be friends,
it's gone on for too long."

34:16.120 --> 34:18.054
Me and Vicky just need to make up.

34:37.041 --> 34:39.277
Bachelor party.
Bachelor party.

34:39.342 --> 34:41.579
Vicky's away
trying wedding dresses on

34:41.646 --> 34:45.216
so the boys think, we'll get a
burger, games of pool, bit of banter,

34:45.283 --> 34:48.252
and it's just nice to get
out of the house with the lads.

34:48.319 --> 34:51.722
The reason why Vicky didn't accept
the apology straight away

34:51.789 --> 34:55.259
is cos Sophie didn't make an effort
when she came back.

34:55.326 --> 34:58.763
Sophie's been back and hasn't
properly apologised to Vicky.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.732
Vicky's like, why doesn't
she apologise properly?

35:04.735 --> 35:06.971
Hi.
Hiya.

35:07.038 --> 35:11.409
As soon as we get into the shop I can
tell that Vicky's emotional and down.

35:11.476 --> 35:14.011
We're waiting for her
to try on the first dress

35:14.078 --> 35:16.447
and we think
it's going to look stunning.

35:17.114 --> 35:20.218
(gasps) Oh, my God,
I feel really emotional.

35:20.284 --> 35:22.854
She comes out
and we just burst into tears.

35:22.920 --> 35:25.122
Don't cry cos I will.

35:25.189 --> 35:29.360
I'm glad I didn't wear any make-up.
Sort of wish I hadn't bothered now.

35:29.427 --> 35:31.963
When I saw them crying
and I felt meself well up

35:32.029 --> 35:35.666
I just thought, maybe you're down,
maybe things aren't perfect,

35:35.733 --> 35:38.135
but these girls do care about you.

35:38.202 --> 35:40.371
It's time to just fucking cheer up.

35:41.439 --> 35:43.374
I think I need some bigger boobs.

35:43.441 --> 35:45.676
Holly, this is probably
the one for you.

35:45.743 --> 35:49.013
Deep down I know there's
only one thing missing.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.382
But I do think
Sophie's gonna come round.

35:51.449 --> 35:54.051
I just feel like there's
a horrible black cloud

35:54.118 --> 35:56.521
over everything that makes us happy.

35:56.587 --> 35:59.257
And if she'd said sorry
she could have been here.

35:59.323 --> 36:02.159
But she didn't want to,
she didn't want to say sorry.

36:02.226 --> 36:05.229
Sophie is so scared to apologise
because she's scared

36:05.296 --> 36:09.066
that Vicky's gonna fling it in her
face, which she did the first time.

36:09.133 --> 36:11.369
But Sophie does need
to apologise to her.

36:12.136 --> 36:13.771
What's the song go like?

36:13.838 --> 36:15.973
(they hum "Wedding March")

36:28.753 --> 36:29.820
Hi.

36:29.887 --> 36:31.489
The house is feeling awkward

36:31.556 --> 36:34.392
and what everyone wants
is for me and Vicky to get on.

36:41.465 --> 36:44.936
I'm trying to build the confidence
to go see her and apologise.

36:45.002 --> 36:48.372
I think, just do it, Sophie. Get
a grip. You've knew her for ages.

36:53.544 --> 36:55.813
Sophie comes
storming round the corner.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.349
I know she's got an apology
but I'm not ready.

36:58.416 --> 37:00.618
It's stupid
cos it's all I want from her.

37:00.685 --> 37:04.789
At the same time I'm completely
blindsided by what she's gonna do.

37:04.855 --> 37:06.023
And I'm not ready.

37:10.528 --> 37:12.730
I just run away like a fucking child.

37:14.632 --> 37:18.669
I'm so emotional. I'm so upset that
I just go in me bedroom and cry.

37:29.914 --> 37:32.783
Sophie's gonna try again
to apologise to Vicky

37:32.850 --> 37:34.485
and I'm hoping that this time

37:34.552 --> 37:36.821
Sophie will be
a lot more sincere about it

37:36.887 --> 37:38.889
and Vicky will accept it.

37:49.166 --> 37:51.736
It's a complete and utter relief.

37:51.802 --> 37:54.772
It feels like a weight's
been lifted off me shoulders

37:54.839 --> 37:56.641
and I can finally start to relax.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.383
I peek over and there's hugs, cries,

38:05.449 --> 38:07.351
kisses. It's just back to normal.

38:11.155 --> 38:14.592
You haven't, man, you stupid idiot.

38:15.993 --> 38:18.062
Me and Vicky are mates again.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.664
Thank fuck.

38:19.730 --> 38:21.532
Praise the Lord.

38:21.599 --> 38:24.935
(cheering) Vicky's back,
Vicky's back, Vicky's back.

38:27.438 --> 38:28.973
Sophie and Vicky made up.

38:29.040 --> 38:32.843
They've got their arm around each
other. How long will it last?

38:40.484 --> 38:45.690

38:50.361 --> 38:52.496
I'm absolutely buzzing
for the night.

38:52.563 --> 38:55.666
The whole family back together.
It's gonna be mint.

38:55.733 --> 38:57.301
Right, let's go, everyone.

38:57.368 --> 38:59.136
It's a chance to see me family.

38:59.203 --> 39:02.440
Everyone can go out and have
some decent food for once, too.

39:12.116 --> 39:14.785
Hey, man.
Are you all right, darling?

39:15.586 --> 39:19.323
First time I've met Kev, he's an
absolute hero, like the Godfather.

39:19.390 --> 39:21.759
Everyone back as a family again.

39:21.826 --> 39:22.860
(all cheer)

39:22.927 --> 39:26.297
Vicky and Sophie are next to
each other. We're having a laugh.

39:26.363 --> 39:29.133
And I'm just so happy
that after quite a long time

39:29.200 --> 39:30.668
the atmosphere has gone.

39:33.904 --> 39:38.309
As always, me dad's got to go
and embarrass the fuck out of me.

39:38.375 --> 39:39.944
And everyone else, too.

39:42.947 --> 39:46.884
Kev comes over straight away
asking embarrassing questions.

39:46.951 --> 39:50.988
Like, are me and Holly still getting
with each other, this sort of crack.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.957
Nah, just friends.

39:53.023 --> 39:55.626
Friends with benefit?
No.

39:55.693 --> 39:58.763
We've had an amazing meal.
We're all together again.

39:58.829 --> 40:02.767
Kevin's come over with a tray of
shots. Everyone whacks them back.

40:02.833 --> 40:05.970

40:14.612 --> 40:16.347
(Scott) Fucking rocking.

40:16.413 --> 40:19.049
Tup Tup VIP to ourselves.
Everyone's hammered.

40:19.116 --> 40:20.718
One big happy family.

40:20.785 --> 40:23.521
Fucking cheers.
(all cheer)

40:25.756 --> 40:28.826
The tunes are bouncing.
I haven't got a care in the world.

40:34.365 --> 40:38.402
And next thing you know,
the girl who James fancies walks in.

40:38.469 --> 40:39.570
Shit.

40:39.637 --> 40:40.805
Hello, how are you?

40:40.871 --> 40:43.707
I'm most nervous about
introducing Kate to Holly.

40:43.774 --> 40:47.178
She's in a good mood now,
but like that she could just change.

40:47.244 --> 40:49.046
Nice to meet you.
And you, babe.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.782
I'm not gonna try and make
massive conversation

40:51.849 --> 40:54.084
because I don't want to be
disrespectful

40:54.151 --> 40:56.020
and say something wrong. Like,

40:56.086 --> 40:58.389
"It's great bouncing on
James's dick."

41:00.124 --> 41:02.259
She's tanned, dark haired, gorgeous.

41:02.326 --> 41:06.363
He's gonna have to get some heels,
cos she dominates him on height.

41:07.798 --> 41:11.502
Wow, she is actually stunning
and I'm just stood here like,

41:11.569 --> 41:13.370
"Whoa, I'm a fat Oompa Loompa."

41:16.473 --> 41:18.776
Holly is not going
to take this good.

41:18.843 --> 41:21.145
She's gonna get fucking mortal.

41:24.748 --> 41:27.384
The awkward bit's over,
Holly's met Kate.

41:27.451 --> 41:30.287
But I see her reaching straight over
for the vodka.

41:33.891 --> 41:37.461
Holly's dealing the only way
she knows how. She's getting drunk.

41:37.528 --> 41:40.865
She's getting really drunk,
acting like she's not bothered

41:40.931 --> 41:43.467
when really that's the total sign
that you are.

41:43.534 --> 41:46.303
# I love cock
I love cock, yes, I do #

41:53.677 --> 41:56.180
It's dead weird
seeing James with a girl

41:56.247 --> 41:57.748
who he really cares about.

41:59.516 --> 42:03.988
For once in James's life he likes
someone more than they like him.

42:09.560 --> 42:12.763
Kate is in a position that Holly
would love to have been in.

42:12.830 --> 42:14.298
No matter what she says,

42:14.365 --> 42:17.001
Holly would love to be
James's girlfriend.

42:32.583 --> 42:34.218
James brings his girl back.

42:34.285 --> 42:37.955
This is the first time James has
walked into the bucking bungalow.

42:39.089 --> 42:42.326
I brought Kate back to the house,
straight to the bungalow.

42:42.393 --> 42:45.396
It's been such a good night.
What a way to finish it off.

42:46.830 --> 42:48.265
Holly hasn't kicked off.

42:48.332 --> 42:51.368
It's looking like
she's finally got over us.

42:51.435 --> 42:53.704
I'm so glad we can now move on.

42:54.772 --> 42:58.575
James and Kate come back to the house
and go straight to the bungalow.

42:58.642 --> 43:03.147
In Mexico that used to be my place
in the bed, not hers.

43:03.213 --> 43:07.484
I thought I would be OK with it,
but I'm not.

43:09.853 --> 43:11.455
(clucking)

43:11.522 --> 43:16.160
It's all about the Bs. Birds, banter,
back, bungalow, bucking, bosh.

43:16.226 --> 43:19.096
Ricci's drinking
and I know what's gonna happen.

43:19.163 --> 43:20.364
You are a liar!

43:20.431 --> 43:22.399
I've never ever seen them this bad.

43:22.466 --> 43:23.534
(yells)

43:23.600 --> 43:25.469
My wingman is letting us down.

43:25.536 --> 43:26.971
Same bird, two nights.

43:27.037 --> 43:30.574
Next thing you know he'll be taking
his kids to the fucking park.

43:32.476 --> 43:34.378
She's going fucking nuts.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.613
Psycho Charlotte is back.
