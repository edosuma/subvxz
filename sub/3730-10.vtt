<i>Previously on "The Whispers"...</i>

00:01.718 --> 00:03.511
- My wish came true.
- What did you wish for?

00:03.660 --> 00:05.963
For Drill make you and daddy
love each other again.

00:06.129 --> 00:07.925
Here's what we know about the entity.

00:08.267 --> 00:10.635
It travels electrically,
through power cables,

00:10.977 --> 00:12.761
so it can be identified
by a heat signature.

00:13.138 --> 00:15.093
He uses kids, but not just any kids.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.482
He chooses them carefully.
They all have access.

00:17.558 --> 00:19.792
Thomas: His whole planet was dying.

00:19.827 --> 00:21.794
He needed to send a signal
back to the others.

00:21.829 --> 00:24.763
Mr. President, we
learned how to kill Drill.

00:24.799 --> 00:26.765
He can posses the body of a child.

00:26.801 --> 00:28.867
Once he does, he can be destroyed.

00:30.004 --> 00:31.637
Mr. Brewster: He never goes outside.

00:31.672 --> 00:33.839
- He's always on the computer.
- Well, that's what kids do today.

00:34.283 --> 00:36.077
- They play on the computer.
- Maybe we should take his away, then.

00:36.494 --> 00:37.843
Let's just sign him up
for some sports or...

00:37.878 --> 00:39.745
He's not you. He doesn't like sports.

00:39.780 --> 00:41.613
Well, we don't always get
to do what we want, do we?

00:41.649 --> 00:43.515
And you know what? It's about
time Nicholas learned that.

00:43.551 --> 00:45.551
Seriously? He is a 10-year-old boy.

00:45.586 --> 00:46.985
Why don't you take him to the park?

00:47.021 --> 00:49.221
I... I see other kids
playing there all the time.

00:49.256 --> 00:51.323
Yeah, the other kids pick on him.

[Amplified whispering]

Stop it! Stop it!

01:13.681 --> 01:14.747
[Crying]

01:14.782 --> 01:15.881
- Nicholas? Nicholas?
- What's wrong?

01:15.916 --> 01:17.483
Nicholas, are you all right?

[Gasping]

01:18.452 --> 01:21.787
Baby?

01:22.373 --> 01:25.508
I heard a voice... Like a ghost.

01:25.543 --> 01:27.443
What are you talking about?

01:27.478 --> 01:30.446
He says he wants to be my friend.

01:30.481 --> 01:32.515
A ghost?

01:32.550 --> 01:34.116
Maybe if he made some real friends,

01:34.152 --> 01:38.054
he wouldn't have to invent imaginary ones.

01:38.089 --> 01:40.256
Come here, baby. You're okay.

01:40.291 --> 01:42.191
Okay.

How long are we gonna live like this?

02:21.733 --> 02:23.733
Until we know we're safe.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.868
How will we know when that is?

02:25.903 --> 02:28.704
- I mean, if Drill can posses a child...
- Lena.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.539
We know how close he is with Minx.

02:30.575 --> 02:32.541
What if... [Sighs]

02:32.577 --> 02:35.711
What if he chooses her?

02:35.747 --> 02:39.382
That's... that's why we have monitors,

02:39.417 --> 02:42.051
sensors all over the house, okay?

02:42.086 --> 02:45.388
If he tries to go near Minx
or any of us, we'll know.

02:45.423 --> 02:49.158
How will knowing stop it from happening?

02:51.129 --> 02:52.595
He finally got to sleep.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.930
Just took three stories
and a children's aspirin.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.932
Said he had a headache again.

02:56.968 --> 03:00.102
He had one last night, too.

03:00.138 --> 03:04.106
Everything he's been through,
to only have a headache?

03:04.142 --> 03:05.441
Pretty tough kid.

03:05.476 --> 03:07.376

03:07.412 --> 03:10.246

Minx?!

04:30.628 --> 04:31.527
No, Drill! Leave me alone!

04:31.562 --> 04:32.761
You stay away from her!

04:32.797 --> 04:34.029
[Gasps]

04:35.733 --> 04:37.967
It's okay, daddy. He's gone now.

04:38.002 --> 04:40.503
Okay. What did he want?

04:40.538 --> 04:45.107
He said that he'd forgive us
for everything we've done if...

04:45.142 --> 04:46.909
If I help him make a new friend.

04:46.944 --> 04:48.978
Okay, what... what... what friend, honey?

04:49.013 --> 04:50.312
Did he... did he say who it is?

04:50.348 --> 04:53.716
No. You said not to talk to him anymore.

04:53.751 --> 04:54.950
- Good.
- So I didn't.

04:54.986 --> 04:57.052
- Good.
- It's okay, baby. You did good.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.622
We're just trying to figure out
what Drill is up to.

04:59.657 --> 05:03.726
I don't know. But whatever
it is, it's gonna happen soon.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.628
How do you know?

05:05.663 --> 05:08.964
Because he said he needed to
play with his new friend <i> now</i>

05:09.000 --> 05:13.135
because... He's running out of time.

05:13.170 --> 05:14.770
Claire: Time for what?

05:14.805 --> 05:15.738
We don't know.

05:15.773 --> 05:16.772
Well, if Drill's looking for a new friend,

05:16.823 --> 05:18.869
- that means he needs access to someone.
- Or something.

05:18.992 --> 05:20.532
But what? A-a new energy source?

05:20.702 --> 05:21.544
Well, we know he tried to call his friends,

05:21.620 --> 05:23.579
and we destroyed any possibility of that.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.015
So what would he want to do next?

05:26.050 --> 05:27.283
It doesn't matter what Drill
wants. It's what <i> we</i> want.

05:27.318 --> 05:28.584
It's this thing out of lives for good.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.252
Now, the only way we're gonna do that

05:30.288 --> 05:31.420
is to stop reacting to Drill.

05:31.421 --> 05:33.376
- We need to get a step ahead of him.
- Okay, but how?

05:33.412 --> 05:34.644
The same way we would if we were tracking

05:34.680 --> 05:36.980
any other killer... we profile Drill.

05:37.260 --> 05:39.160
What are his habits?
How does he choose his victims?

05:39.196 --> 05:40.829
And what happens when you find him?

05:40.864 --> 05:43.064
We all know what
it's gonna take to kill Drill.

05:43.099 --> 05:44.566
Are we really willing to go that far?

05:44.601 --> 05:46.868
Henry: Dad?

05:46.903 --> 05:47.902
Yeah?

05:47.938 --> 05:50.705
I... I don't feel very good.

05:52.008 --> 05:55.577
Is it your head again, sweetheart?

05:55.612 --> 05:57.712
No, it's all over.

05:59.049 --> 06:01.716
I got it, Claire.
I'll take him to the doctor.

06:03.186 --> 06:06.888
You guys find the bastard
that's been hurting our kids.

06:06.923 --> 06:08.990
- Okay. How the hell do we do that?
- We know he feeds on energy.

06:09.025 --> 06:10.725
We know he travels through power lines.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.928
So there has to be some kind
of evidence of that, right?

06:13.964 --> 06:17.265
Trail of breadcrumbs
telling us where he's been,

06:17.300 --> 06:19.734
hopefully where he's going next.

06:19.769 --> 06:24.772
Ah, there you are. Good afternoon.
Agents, what can I do for you?

06:24.808 --> 06:26.708
We're wondering if
you've noticed any anomalies

06:26.743 --> 06:29.677
in energy consumption over
the last few weeks...

06:29.713 --> 06:32.313
spikes, dips, anything out of the ordinary.

06:32.349 --> 06:34.749
Guess it depends on what you
mean by "out of the ordinary."

06:34.784 --> 06:37.518
[Clears throat]

06:38.922 --> 06:40.989
[Beeping]

06:41.024 --> 06:41.923
What are those?

06:41.958 --> 06:43.491
Brownouts.

06:43.526 --> 06:44.726
They're not uncommon in the summer heat,

06:44.761 --> 06:45.793
when, uh, people crank their A.C.,

06:45.829 --> 06:48.496
but it's been pretty cool lately, so...

06:48.531 --> 06:49.964
Can you pull up the addresses?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.165
Yeah, sure. Over here.

06:53.236 --> 06:54.369
[Sighs]

06:54.404 --> 06:56.671
- [Beep]
- There you go.

06:59.276 --> 07:00.875
There's a school, playground...

07:02.979 --> 07:04.379
Harbor Point nuclear power plant.

07:04.414 --> 07:07.282
Bureau office where
we interviewed the kids.

07:07.317 --> 07:09.517
Wes' house.

07:09.552 --> 07:11.352
My house.

07:11.388 --> 07:13.288
Capitol University Hospital, last night.

07:13.323 --> 07:15.757
[Sighs] This is him, Claire.

07:15.792 --> 07:18.493
That one, from this morning...
what's this spot?

07:18.561 --> 07:21.863
Don't know. It's restricted.

07:21.898 --> 07:23.398
One of those government buildings.

07:23.433 --> 07:25.199
Usually NSA, D.O.D.

07:25.235 --> 07:27.769
Uh-huh.

07:27.837 --> 07:29.570
We need to know what's there.

07:29.606 --> 07:33.441
Okay, Claire. I... I'll make a few calls.

07:33.476 --> 07:34.575
- [Beep]
- Mr. Lawrence.

07:34.611 --> 07:35.743
Talk to me, Theo.

07:35.779 --> 07:37.845
Okay, so, we looked
at the four thermal images

07:37.881 --> 07:39.781
that you brought to us.

07:39.816 --> 07:41.416
The first image is from 10 days ago,

07:41.451 --> 07:44.319
directly after he consumed
the energy from the meltdown.

07:44.354 --> 07:46.120
Now, the most recent image is from today.

07:46.156 --> 07:48.890
Now, these images might
look similar to the naked eye,

07:48.925 --> 07:50.258
but they're not.

07:50.293 --> 07:52.827
From one image to the other,
the I.R. Energy is changing.

07:52.862 --> 07:54.996
Theo? Layman's terms, please.

07:55.031 --> 07:57.598
Uh, your alien has dissipated.

07:57.634 --> 07:59.734
It's literally getting less powerful.

07:59.769 --> 08:01.135
That's not possible.

08:01.171 --> 08:03.104
It's continually eating...
lights, power lines, et cetera.

08:03.139 --> 08:05.039
Maybe it's different where he's from.

08:05.075 --> 08:07.608
But in this planet, in this atmosphere,

08:07.644 --> 08:09.610
he's basically chewing celery.

08:09.646 --> 08:10.845
I don't understand.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.481
It takes more energy to chew celery

08:13.516 --> 08:15.316
than the celery can provide,

08:15.352 --> 08:16.918
so a human being
eating nothing but celery...

08:16.953 --> 08:20.121
will starve to death.

08:28.498 --> 08:30.298
Hey, Nicholas.

08:30.333 --> 08:31.799
Can we ask you a couple of questions?

08:31.835 --> 08:34.268
I guess.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.403
When you were born,

08:35.438 --> 08:36.738
did the whole hospital get stretch marks?

08:36.773 --> 08:38.006
[Laughs]

08:38.041 --> 08:39.440
Just leave me alone, okay?

08:42.379 --> 08:43.378
Please!

08:43.413 --> 08:44.812
Okay, let him go.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.626
[Grunts]

08:58.661 --> 08:59.861
[Grunting]

08:59.896 --> 09:03.097
[Electricity crackling]

09:04.200 --> 09:05.566

09:06.736 --> 09:09.370

09:09.406 --> 09:11.372
[Whispering]

09:19.716 --> 09:21.015
What did you say your name was?

09:21.051 --> 09:24.352
[Whispering]

09:24.387 --> 09:26.020
Thank you for saving me, Drill.

09:26.056 --> 09:28.356
[Whispering]

09:28.391 --> 09:29.690
Okay.

09:29.726 --> 09:30.858
[Whispering]

09:30.894 --> 09:32.360
How can I help save you?

09:32.395 --> 09:33.928
[Electricity crackles]

09:38.559 --> 09:39.725
The location you asked about...

09:39.761 --> 09:42.828
there's a good reason
why it's ghosted on the map.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.602
- DSN.
- The deep space network.

09:46.603 --> 09:48.370
It's a system of transmission equipment

09:48.405 --> 09:52.874
used to track, receive, and send
messages to orbiting spacecraft.

09:52.910 --> 09:55.777
We destroyed the rock, so Drill,

09:55.813 --> 09:57.946
he must be looking for another
way to send out the signal.

09:57.981 --> 09:59.581
While he still can.

09:59.616 --> 10:02.617
When he told Minx that he was
"running out of time,"

10:02.653 --> 10:04.219
this is what he meant.

10:04.254 --> 10:05.420
Now, according to my team,

10:05.456 --> 10:08.890
Drill is getting weaker
every minute of every day.

10:08.926 --> 10:10.659
Now, if we can keep him away from DSN

10:10.694 --> 10:13.094
or, more importantly,
keep him from feeding,

10:13.130 --> 10:14.329
them maybe we don't have to kill him,

10:14.364 --> 10:15.397
'cause maybe he'll just die off.

10:15.432 --> 10:17.332
Wes...

10:17.367 --> 10:19.034
I think I know how we do it.

10:19.069 --> 10:21.603
- Wes?
- [Knock on wall]

10:21.638 --> 10:23.505
[Sighs] Lena, what's...

10:23.574 --> 10:26.575
What's going on?

10:26.610 --> 10:27.876
Honey, I think I forgot
my sweater upstairs.

10:27.911 --> 10:29.177
Would you go check for me?

10:29.213 --> 10:31.413
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

10:31.448 --> 10:34.082
What's this?

10:34.117 --> 10:35.851
I'm scared.

10:35.886 --> 10:38.920
If this thing can possess a child...

10:38.956 --> 10:41.957
I can't lose her.

10:41.992 --> 10:43.525
Not to something like that.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.927
If Drill really wants Minx,

10:45.963 --> 10:48.363
there's not a place he can't find her.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.932
It doesn't matter if he knows where she is

10:50.968 --> 10:52.033
if he can't get to her.

10:53.704 --> 10:57.839
We're taking a cruise from
Baltimore to the Caribbean.

10:57.875 --> 11:00.275
If Drill travels through
power lines, then...

11:00.310 --> 11:02.777
you're taking her where there aren't any.

11:02.813 --> 11:04.513
It's a good plan.

11:04.548 --> 11:05.847
It's not a good plan.

11:07.050 --> 11:08.483
It's a <i> great</i> plan.

11:08.519 --> 11:09.918
[Chuckles]

11:09.953 --> 11:13.288
I don't want you to leave... either of you.

11:13.323 --> 11:16.424
Well, we're not <i> leaving.</i>
We're just taking a vacation.

11:17.494 --> 11:19.594
- Okay.
- [Chuckles]

11:19.630 --> 11:21.363
[Smooches]

11:21.398 --> 11:23.965
[Chuckles]

11:24.001 --> 11:25.600
I couldn't find it, mommy.

11:25.636 --> 11:27.869
That's okay, sweetie.
Come say goodbye to daddy.

11:27.905 --> 11:30.438
Hey. [Smooches] Come here.

11:30.474 --> 11:33.141
Now, listen to me.

11:33.176 --> 11:34.576
You be a good girl for your mother, okay?

11:34.611 --> 11:35.844
Okay.

11:35.879 --> 11:37.412
- Okay?
- Okay.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.547
- Okay?
- Okay.

11:38.582 --> 11:39.848
Okay. [Smooches]

11:39.883 --> 11:41.149
[Chuckles] Take care. I love you.

11:41.184 --> 11:42.417
Bye, daddy. I love you, too.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.352
See you soon. Bye.

11:44.421 --> 11:45.520
Mwah.

11:45.556 --> 11:48.423
Okay, off we go.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.192
[Wheels roll]

11:51.228 --> 11:53.194
Sean: It started as a headache.

11:53.230 --> 11:55.797
Now he's saying he's hurting everywhere.

11:55.832 --> 11:59.234
- Feels tired, weak.
- [Sighs]

11:59.269 --> 12:01.002
This is a hospital, Sean.

12:01.038 --> 12:02.771
Why not just bring him to his pediatrician?

12:02.806 --> 12:05.540
I wasn't sure if his unique circumstance

12:05.609 --> 12:06.975
was the thing that might
be causing any of this,

12:07.010 --> 12:09.477
so I thought if anybody
understood, it was you.

12:12.449 --> 12:13.515
I know what you're thinking

12:13.550 --> 12:14.749
about those kids from last night.

12:14.785 --> 12:17.986
But Henry's not like that.
He's a good boy, Maria.

12:18.021 --> 12:20.589
You think he wouldn't
do whatever Drill asked

12:20.624 --> 12:23.792
to save your life or his mother's?

12:23.827 --> 12:26.394
We're all good, Sean,

12:26.430 --> 12:28.496
until we have something to lose.

12:31.034 --> 12:33.101
Haley: Have you lost your mind?

12:33.136 --> 12:35.103
Black out an entire city?

12:35.138 --> 12:36.705
Not the whole city, sir.
Just the parts that...

12:36.740 --> 12:39.174
Do you have any idea of
the panic it would cause?

12:39.209 --> 12:40.275
Oh, we do, sir. And by all means,

12:40.310 --> 12:42.210
we are open to any ideas
you have to capture

12:42.245 --> 12:43.945
the alien loose in our nation's capitol.

12:43.981 --> 12:46.214
Watching the grid,
we can identify his signature.

12:46.249 --> 12:47.382
The next time he shows himself,

12:47.417 --> 12:50.318
we shut the power down
grid by grid, block by block.

12:50.354 --> 12:55.323
We drive him, funnel him
right where we want him.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.425
Wes: A secure, abandoned
building by the water.

12:57.461 --> 12:59.995
A safe zone with no people, no electricity.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.797
- Yeah, and then what?
- We starve him out.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.899
With no energy to feed on,
no way to leave the area...

13:04.935 --> 13:07.335
and how long will that take?
We can't truly predict...

13:07.371 --> 13:09.938
wait, you want to bring
Washington to its knees,

13:09.973 --> 13:12.040
and you can't even tell me
how long it's gonna take?

13:12.075 --> 13:13.508
Sir, I don't care how long it takes

13:13.543 --> 13:14.943
because if we don't do something today,

13:14.978 --> 13:17.212
Drill could bring this country
to its knees by tomorrow.

13:17.247 --> 13:18.813
The DSN is secure.

13:18.849 --> 13:21.216
Even if Drill can access
the electrical system,

13:21.251 --> 13:23.351
operating the satellites
requires security codes

13:23.387 --> 13:24.919
that change daily.

13:24.955 --> 13:26.254
There's no way he can access...

13:26.289 --> 13:28.857
he accessed a secure nuclear
facility while were outside,

13:28.892 --> 13:30.291
waiting for him to get there.

13:31.862 --> 13:33.928
He will find a way, sir.

13:33.964 --> 13:35.930
He always does.

13:38.201 --> 13:39.801
[Sighs]

13:39.836 --> 13:42.037
I... fine, fine. I'll come in early.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.438
But tell Bishop he owes me, all right?

13:43.473 --> 13:45.173
That's three times this month.

13:45.208 --> 13:46.508
And it's always me that gets the call.

13:46.543 --> 13:49.110
Why is that?

13:49.146 --> 13:51.079
I do have a life, you know.

13:51.114 --> 13:53.181
No, I'm not trying to
make more of this than it is.

13:53.216 --> 13:56.685
Just a schedule's a schedule, right?

13:58.722 --> 13:59.654
[Clicking]

13:59.690 --> 14:00.855
Yeah, well, tell that to Bishop.

14:02.159 --> 14:04.526
Tell him I can't do it tonight.

14:14.404 --> 14:16.304
Claire: How's my boy?

14:16.339 --> 14:17.605
I'm worried about him.

14:17.641 --> 14:19.074
Maria's still examining him.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.141
Still?

14:20.177 --> 14:21.509
I thought you'd be home by now.

14:21.545 --> 14:24.612
Yeah. Hopefully soon. Why? What's wrong?

14:24.648 --> 14:25.814
We're blacking out the city, Sean.

14:25.849 --> 14:27.916
But to help make sure
that Drill doesn't find out,

14:27.951 --> 14:29.284
we can't tell the public, so...

14:29.319 --> 14:30.464
You know it's gonna be
a madhouse out there.

14:30.752 --> 14:33.822
Yeah. Get home as soon as possible.

14:33.857 --> 14:35.123
Okay, I don't want the two of you

14:35.158 --> 14:36.758
out on the streets when this hits.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.561
Okay.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.536
The school was shut down three years ago,

14:48.572 --> 14:50.572
so we got complete control of the campus.

14:50.607 --> 14:53.842
- Neighbors?
- Compliant so far.

14:53.877 --> 14:55.810
We've evacuated nearly all of them.

14:55.846 --> 14:57.145
[Radio chatter]

14:57.180 --> 14:58.646
What do you got?

14:58.682 --> 15:00.949
All right.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.951
These give us what
the thermal cameras are showing,

15:02.986 --> 15:04.419
and this one's tapped
into the city power grid.

15:04.454 --> 15:06.354
[Beep]

15:06.389 --> 15:07.655
Mr. Secretary, can you hear me?

15:07.691 --> 15:10.625
Loud and clear, Wes.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.293
Everything is in position.

15:12.329 --> 15:13.628
We're just waiting for eyes on the target.

15:13.663 --> 15:14.696
Jessup: Any sign?

15:14.731 --> 15:17.198
Not yet.

15:17.234 --> 15:18.399
Where are you, you son of a bitch?

15:22.506 --> 15:24.472
Is that him?

15:24.508 --> 15:25.707
It's the same energy draw

15:25.742 --> 15:28.143
as the brownouts you isolated before.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.978
Looks like a park in Columbia Heights.

15:30.013 --> 15:33.815
[Breathes deeply] What do you think?

15:33.850 --> 15:36.651
President Winters: You better be
damn sure, Mr. Lawrence,

15:36.686 --> 15:38.286
before I blind this city.

15:39.489 --> 15:41.790
We're sure, Mr. president.

15:43.727 --> 15:46.027
Then shut it down.

15:46.062 --> 15:47.962
[Beep]

15:47.998 --> 15:50.999
[Powering down]

16:00.257 --> 16:01.124
Minx: What is it, mommy?

16:01.134 --> 16:03.034
It looks like we're delayed an hour.

16:03.069 --> 16:05.903
Okay, honey. Why don't
we go sit over there?

16:05.939 --> 16:07.872
[Indistinct talking over P.A.]

16:12.312 --> 16:14.178
[Insects chirping]

16:19.519 --> 16:21.085
Drill?

16:21.120 --> 16:22.686
Where are you?

16:22.722 --> 16:25.256
I brought what you wanted.

16:25.291 --> 16:27.458
Look who's back.

16:30.596 --> 16:31.996
I'm supposed to meet my friend.

16:32.031 --> 16:34.265
Sorry. Your friend ain't coming this time.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.733
How do you know?

16:35.768 --> 16:36.967
'Cause he told me.

16:37.003 --> 16:39.570
What?

16:39.605 --> 16:40.538
It was pretty cool.

16:40.573 --> 16:41.972
He said he couldn't stay here

16:42.008 --> 16:45.342
and that you have to follow
the lights to find him.

16:45.378 --> 16:47.444
He also told me you're all right,

16:47.480 --> 16:49.413
and we should give you a chance to show it.

16:49.448 --> 16:51.715
Thank you.

16:51.751 --> 16:53.150
Good luck, Nicholas.

16:58.724 --> 17:00.925
Haley: We're getting the first
crime reports in now

17:00.960 --> 17:02.460
from the blacked-out areas, Agent Bennigan.

17:02.484 --> 17:03.884
Well, that's to be expected, sir.

17:03.919 --> 17:05.050
Question is, how long do
you stand around at the dance

17:05.087 --> 17:07.521
till you realize you've been stood up?

17:07.556 --> 17:09.756
Maybe you should tell me, sir.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.458
My dates always showed.

17:14.930 --> 17:16.863
[Sighs]

17:16.898 --> 17:18.898
Come on. Where are you?

17:20.935 --> 17:22.868
[Horns honking] Man: <i> We're monitoring
the situation as best can.</i>

17:22.905 --> 17:24.971
<i>Obviously, the conditions</i>
<i>are just horrendous</i>

17:25.007 --> 17:26.906
<i>for anyone in Baltimore today.</i>

17:26.942 --> 17:28.407
<i>Because of these power outages, traffic...</i>

17:28.443 --> 17:29.376
Almost home.

17:29.411 --> 17:32.279
Shouldn't be too much longer, okay?

17:32.314 --> 17:36.016
Did the doctor tell you
what's wrong with me?

17:36.051 --> 17:37.651
Uh, we had to leave
before the test came back,

17:37.686 --> 17:38.818
but I'm sure it's probably nothing

17:38.854 --> 17:40.754
to worry about right now, okay, little man?

17:40.789 --> 17:42.989
[Siren wails in distance]

17:43.025 --> 17:46.026
But what if it's not nothing?

17:46.061 --> 17:48.728
What if it's Drill punishing me

17:48.764 --> 17:50.197
'cause I won't play with him anymore?

17:50.232 --> 17:51.831
Drill's not gonna hurt you, Henry.

17:51.867 --> 17:54.267
In fact, mom is out there right now,

17:54.303 --> 17:57.771
making sure that he can't hurt
you or anyone else ever again.

17:57.806 --> 17:59.673
[Indistinct shouting in distance]

17:59.708 --> 18:02.876
Okay.

18:04.947 --> 18:06.079
[Sighs]

18:06.114 --> 18:08.715
[Electricity crackling]

18:17.025 --> 18:19.092
- [Tap on shoulder]
- What?

18:19.127 --> 18:21.027
He's here.

18:25.367 --> 18:26.900
[Beep]

18:26.935 --> 18:28.668
- 8th and Jefferson?
- 8th and Jefferson.

18:28.704 --> 18:29.903
Are you sure it's him?

18:29.938 --> 18:31.137
There's nothing on the grid
at their location.

18:31.173 --> 18:33.106
If Henry says it's there,
I say we go for it.

18:33.141 --> 18:34.341
Claire: If we black out that grid,

18:34.376 --> 18:36.610
they'll be stuck right in the middle of it.

18:36.645 --> 18:38.211
Sean: Claire, we're gonna be fine.

18:38.247 --> 18:39.512
Just do it.

18:39.548 --> 18:41.314
[Beeping]

18:41.350 --> 18:43.717
Take out grid 8.

18:57.432 --> 18:59.532
What's going on?

18:59.568 --> 19:00.634
Hey.

19:00.669 --> 19:03.236
We're gonna be fine. Okay?

19:04.740 --> 19:05.939
It worked. There he is.

19:05.974 --> 19:07.540
[Beep] Claire: Look at all those brownouts.

19:07.576 --> 19:08.708
It's like he's starting to panic.

19:08.744 --> 19:11.645
He must be trying to find a way out.

19:11.680 --> 19:12.912
Well, let's give him one.

19:12.948 --> 19:16.950
Funnel him straight to us.
Take out 5, 6, and 7.

He's inside the school.

20:30.492 --> 20:33.360
He's here.

Go dark now.

20:43.516 --> 20:45.916
[Powering down]

20:47.987 --> 20:50.888
- It worked?
- It seems so.

20:50.923 --> 20:53.924
Without any power source,
he can't move, right?

20:53.960 --> 20:55.193
That's the idea.

20:55.252 --> 20:57.820
I think we can assume he's not
gonna be too happy about this.

Honey, we've been through this.

21:47.438 --> 21:49.471
I don't want to leave daddy here.

21:49.507 --> 21:51.273
He's gonna come meet us as soon as he can.

21:52.843 --> 21:55.077
Honey, here. Come.

22:00.117 --> 22:02.151
Look, I don't like the idea
of being away from your dad

22:02.186 --> 22:04.586
any more than you do.

22:04.622 --> 22:06.321
But...

22:06.357 --> 22:09.558
Drill doesn't care about <i> us.</i>
He's after <i> you.</i>

22:09.593 --> 22:12.494
And we need to keep you as
far away from him as possible.

[Sighs]

22:21.906 --> 22:24.907
I don't know.

22:24.942 --> 22:26.508
We need to find your dad.

22:26.544 --> 22:28.110
Claire: Have you heard from Lena?

22:28.145 --> 22:29.745
Yeah, she said she'd call me when she gets

22:29.780 --> 22:31.947
far enough out to sea.

22:31.982 --> 22:34.216
Hopefully, you'll be able
to tell her this is all over,

22:34.251 --> 22:36.385
she and Minx can come home.

22:36.420 --> 22:40.889
Sean and Henry would like
that news, too, right?

22:40.925 --> 22:45.160
I like him... Sean.
He's... he's a good man.

22:45.196 --> 22:47.730
Yeah.

22:49.900 --> 22:53.368
Yeah, he is.

22:53.404 --> 22:55.938
It's funny.

22:55.973 --> 23:00.776
I think I had to lose him...
<i>really</i> lose him...

23:00.811 --> 23:03.879
to understand exactly what
it was I needed to save.

23:03.914 --> 23:06.315
I feel the same way...

23:06.350 --> 23:08.417
About Lena.

23:08.452 --> 23:11.286
I guess I just forgot who she really was.

[Indistinct conversation in distance]

23:31.876 --> 23:34.743
There's something there.

23:34.779 --> 23:36.645
What?

23:36.680 --> 23:37.980
There. You see?

23:38.015 --> 23:39.248
Wes, there's a kid inside.

23:39.283 --> 23:40.249
How?

23:40.284 --> 23:41.617
Drill. He must have lured him.

23:41.652 --> 23:43.218
He knew what was happening.
He took a hostage.

23:48.125 --> 23:50.025
Sir, we need to get the kid out.

23:50.060 --> 23:52.795
No, what we need to do
is hold our position.

23:52.830 --> 23:54.429
I can get to him before anything happens.

23:54.465 --> 23:57.199
For all we know, that kid
may be part of a trap.

23:57.234 --> 23:58.967
I will not allow you or any
of my men to take that risk.

23:59.003 --> 24:01.904
- I need you to stay here, Claire.
- Wes, I'm going with you.

24:01.939 --> 24:03.205
Claire.

24:07.444 --> 24:11.880
What the hell are you doing?
I ordered you to stand down.

24:11.916 --> 24:14.616
I'm sorry, Mr. Secretary.
I'm disobeying those orders.

24:14.652 --> 24:18.187
Wes, this is insubordination.

You stay away from Henry!

Aah! It's so hot! It's burning!

32:14.780 --> 32:16.814
Please make it stop! Drill,

32:16.849 --> 32:18.983
you say you love them, but you don't.

32:19.018 --> 32:20.037
You wouldn't do this to someone that

- you love.
- I'm burning! I'm burning!

- I can't do that, Wes.

We can't do it this way.

Sir, we may not get another shot.
[Screaming]

32:38.571 --> 32:41.805
This is our chance to destroy the enemy.

32:41.841 --> 32:43.874
- Yes, at what cost?
- "At what cost?"

32:43.909 --> 32:46.176
We make these decisions every day, Wes.

32:46.212 --> 32:48.312
As difficult as this sacrifice is,

32:48.347 --> 32:49.880
it's ultimately a small price,
when you consider...

32:49.915 --> 32:53.684
if you think this comes at
a small price, you're wrong.

32:53.719 --> 32:55.386
- Wes, we can't let this happen.
- I know.

32:55.421 --> 32:57.521
Mr. president, before
you were commander in chief,

32:57.556 --> 32:59.923
you were a father. You are a father.

32:59.959 --> 33:02.760
And Nicholas, he has a father...

33:02.795 --> 33:04.228
a father who you will
have to face and explain why

33:04.263 --> 33:05.529
you allowed his son to die.

33:05.564 --> 33:07.631
For that father, there will be no solace.

33:07.666 --> 33:10.601
So for that, I assure you
this is no small price.

33:10.636 --> 33:13.437
Let Drill go. Please.

33:13.472 --> 33:14.438
Nicholas: Please! Please stop!

33:14.473 --> 33:15.739
We will find another way.

33:15.775 --> 33:18.075
Open up the grid.

33:18.110 --> 33:19.743
Mr. President, I have to advise you...

This is not over.

33:37.663 --> 33:39.630
You hear me?

33:42.668 --> 33:45.302
I will hunt you down.

33:45.337 --> 33:48.972
I will destroy you.

Mark my words, you will never win!

Are you okay?

Oh, I'm not gonna take your money.

- Please.
- No, y... You needed a helping hand.

That's all I offered.

34:52.813 --> 34:54.112
Oh.

I was worried you were gonna be
some crazy killer or something.

I'm sorry.
