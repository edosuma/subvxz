00:01.208 --> 00:02.959
So, who are you bringing
to this engagement party?

00:03.041 --> 00:04.417
Nice little side piece?

00:04.500 --> 00:06.375
Pretty sure I know
what "side piece" means,

00:06.458 --> 00:07.875
and no, I will be flying solo.

00:07.959 --> 00:09.875
Oh. Are you
in a rut?

00:09.959 --> 00:12.208
My two cents? Put the ladies
in the game, coach.

00:12.291 --> 00:15.375
The.. the ladies and I
are doing just fine.

00:15.458 --> 00:17.583
And why is it
that everyone always assumes

00:17.667 --> 00:19.125
that if a 46-year-old woman
shows up

00:19.208 --> 00:20.625
somewhere alone,
she's miserable?

00:20.709 --> 00:22.750
I lead a very fulfilling life.

00:22.834 --> 00:23.875
Sounds lovely.

00:23.959 --> 00:25.583
But, just FYI,

00:25.667 --> 00:27.041
there is a very
reputable service

00:27.125 --> 00:28.583
that caters to women
like yourself.

00:28.667 --> 00:29.875
They're very discreet

00:29.959 --> 00:31.875
and you're only paying
for their company.

00:31.959 --> 00:33.208
I'm not gonna take an escort

00:33.291 --> 00:34.917
to my friend's engagement party.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.333
Besides, if I wanted
to have a date, I could.

00:37.417 --> 00:38.625
My phone is, like,

00:38.709 --> 00:39.917
all men's names.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.917
Look! Adam. Man.
First one. Boom.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.917
I just know if I were showing up
to an engagement party

00:45.000 --> 00:46.583
full of my judgey
married friends,

00:46.667 --> 00:48.000
I'd either bring a date
or a Vicodin.

00:48.083 --> 00:50.458
Yeah, I ran out.

00:50.542 --> 00:53.083
Maybe you're right, I should
just bring a date to this thing.

00:53.166 --> 00:54.959
Oh, yeah?

00:55.041 --> 00:56.250
Well, your prayers
have been answered.

00:56.333 --> 00:57.917
What's the occasion?
Wedding?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.875
Bar mitzvah? Oh, please say
it's a bar mitzvah.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.917
I love those little hats
and I dance a mean Hora.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.125
Oh, no.
Never gonna happen.

01:04.208 --> 01:06.291
Sara, some people are put on
this earth to play baseball,

01:06.375 --> 01:07.917
others to explore
the infinite mystery

01:08.000 --> 01:10.917
of our oceans' depths.
Me?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.959
I was born to be a plus one.
It's what I love to do

01:13.041 --> 01:14.291
and nobody does it better.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.583
Oh, come on,

01:15.667 --> 01:16.917
can you honestly tell me

01:17.000 --> 01:18.333
that you don't want to walk...

01:18.417 --> 01:20.917
into that party
with this on your arm?

01:21.000 --> 01:24.792
(chuckles) Hand me a gavel,
'cause this case is closed.

01:24.875 --> 01:26.500
Oh, I like that one. Check to
see if anyone said that before.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.083
I'd prefer not to.

01:28.166 --> 01:30.959
swivel back around
and grab my purse.

01:31.041 --> 01:32.792
All right, fine.
It's your funeral.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.333
Oh, is it a funeral?
I kill at funerals. Ooh,

01:35.417 --> 01:37.625
accidental joke.

01:37.709 --> 01:39.125
What?

01:39.208 --> 01:41.959
Yes?

01:42.041 --> 01:43.625
Oh... (scoffs)
Come on. Like her.

01:43.709 --> 01:45.375
I mean, I like her.
I mean, we have a kid together

01:45.458 --> 01:46.959
and a grandkid
and she introduced me

01:47.041 --> 01:48.375
to turkey bacon.
I like her, sure.

01:48.458 --> 01:49.959

where it is,
who's on the guest list,

Boom, hand me a gavel,

Hold on, I'm gonna

02:02.291 --> 02:04.041

03:20.125 --> 03:23.041
Right, I was transferred
to Boise,

03:23.125 --> 03:24.959
but they transferred me back.

03:25.041 --> 03:27.959

it could hurt to ask.

I haven't done that
since the '80s.

03:39.375 --> 03:42.625
No, no, no, Laura, I swear,
I told Eli not to ask you.

03:42.709 --> 03:45.375
Yes, I'm familiar with that
marriage arrangement,

03:45.458 --> 03:47.000

Why would she do this?

04:24.875 --> 04:27.000
Kim did not
deserve to get fired.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.041
That TV remote was not small.

04:29.125 --> 04:31.125
What kid is so determined
to flush something

04:31.208 --> 04:33.333
that she breaks it into smaller,
flushable pieces?

04:33.417 --> 04:34.625
Clearly she's acting out, right?

04:34.709 --> 04:36.208
Do you think she's mad at us?

04:36.291 --> 04:38.917
She can't be mad at me.
I buy her presents all the time.

just remember:

Don't look. Okay, a
couple of years ago,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.125
we went on a date, and
it turned into this crazy,

08:52.208 --> 08:54.625
passionate weekend.

08:54.709 --> 08:57.625
He was artistic
and free-spirited, confident,

08:57.709 --> 09:00.375
and we even made plans to go out
the following weekend.

09:00.458 --> 09:02.583
And then I did that stupid
thing where you start to think,

09:02.667 --> 09:04.291
"Oh, this could be
something real."

09:04.375 --> 09:06.625
And it would have been the
first real thing that I'd had

09:06.709 --> 09:10.417
in a long time. Plus, we were
extremely compatible sexually.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.250
You are a grandmother.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.750
The next weekend never happened.

09:12.834 --> 09:13.834
He just disappeared.

09:13.917 --> 09:14.875
And the jerk didn't

09:14.959 --> 09:16.250
even text me.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.250
And now he's here
with a pretty girl,

09:18.333 --> 09:21.083
and I'm alone.

09:21.166 --> 09:23.083
All right. Come on.

09:23.166 --> 09:26.000
Let's go make this clown regret
ever letting you go, huh?

09:26.083 --> 09:28.417
Okay.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.792
Okay. Okay.

09:30.875 --> 09:33.583
What's sexier, do you think,
Australian or Spanish accent?

09:33.667 --> 09:36.583
Neither, please.

09:36.667 --> 09:38.458
GERALD:
<i>So, to solve the problem,</i>

09:38.542 --> 09:39.750
we have locked down the toilet

09:39.834 --> 09:41.417

everywhere.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.083

office, bathroom.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.709
Yeah, that's why you put
a camera

09:45.792 --> 09:48.792
in the bathroom Vanessa uses.
(chuckles)

09:48.875 --> 09:49.834

09:52.291 --> 09:55.375
Huh. Edie's not in her bed.

It's Craig, actually.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.333
No biggie.
It's really good to see you.

10:54.417 --> 10:57.750
This is my boyfriend.

Actually, second.

11:05.458 --> 11:08.083
Second date. What was our second
date? It was so long ago.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.083
It was, like, what,
two years ago, right?

11:10.166 --> 11:12.083
Feels like it
was just yesterday.

11:12.166 --> 11:15.083
You can't beat new love.
But the real trick

11:15.166 --> 11:18.834
is finding a way to keep that
excitement alive year two.

11:18.917 --> 11:20.417
JIMMY:
We can't tell you
how we did it.

11:20.500 --> 11:21.959
Wouldn't be appropriate
around mixed company.

11:22.041 --> 11:26.667
(chuckling)

11:26.750 --> 11:27.792
Uh, we're gonna take off.

James.

11:34.792 --> 11:36.208
Hey, Craig.

11:36.291 --> 11:37.500

Thanks, but we're pretty beat...

11:43.542 --> 11:44.583
why not?

11:44.667 --> 11:46.709
Follow us, huh?

11:46.792 --> 11:48.709
(quietly):
He's jealin' so hard.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.625

11:50.709 --> 11:52.542
Yep. Whoa.

Okay, no cupping.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.917
we slept together.
Like, a year ago.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.125
Which means
he cheated on her.

12:10.208 --> 12:12.083
Yeah.

12:12.166 --> 12:15.083
I know who she is. I think
she's my dental hygienist.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.375
No, it's not her.

12:21.125 --> 12:23.041
For those of you just tuning in,
Vanessa is out of the tub.

12:23.125 --> 12:25.583
We don't know if it's a robe
or a towel situation.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.000
What we do know is right now
she's headed over

12:27.083 --> 12:29.250
to Gerald's bathroom
to stop Edie

12:29.333 --> 12:31.041
from flushing everything
they hold dear

12:31.125 --> 12:32.834
<i>down the toilet.</i>

12:33.208 --> 12:34.959
Uh, my class ring.

12:37.208 --> 12:40.083

the toilet monster! (grunts)

12:47.250 --> 12:49.041
Last item in the cart, folks.
Could be anything.

12:49.125 --> 12:50.458
I know I'm hoping
for a family heirloom.

12:50.542 --> 12:53.291
Mm-hmm.

12:53.375 --> 12:56.333

it's been one heck of a ride.

13:39.709 --> 13:41.375
what is it that you do?

13:41.458 --> 13:43.125
I'm a musician.
Ah.

13:43.208 --> 13:45.959
Right now, I'm in a jazz
quintet, The Quintangibles.

13:46.041 --> 13:47.375

but I hate it.

13:49.166 --> 13:50.709

13:52.458 --> 13:54.542

15:34.333 --> 15:37.041
We worked together
in a bistro.

15:37.125 --> 15:39.250
It was, what, 1989?

15:39.333 --> 15:40.458
That is true.

15:40.542 --> 15:42.500
She was the pastry chef,
I was the host, and,

15:42.583 --> 15:44.917
oh, God, the moment
I saw her, I was into her.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.250

15:47.333 --> 15:49.125

JIMMY:
Right. She avoided me,
and then,

15:50.792 --> 15:53.166
I eventually wore her down,
and we dated

15:53.250 --> 15:55.166
for a while, and then...

15:55.250 --> 15:58.000
But I was young
and dumb, and I...

15:58.083 --> 16:02.083
I didn't realize what I had,
and so I let her go.

16:02.166 --> 16:04.250
I'm sure you guys want me to
get to the end of the story.

16:04.333 --> 16:07.834

16:07.917 --> 16:09.667

16:46.041 --> 16:47.834

16:47.917 --> 16:49.208
It's not that funny.

16:49.291 --> 16:51.750
We're not a couple, Craig.

16:51.834 --> 16:54.417

that clearly went on too long.

16:54.500 --> 16:58.000
Sorry. What?

16:58.083 --> 17:00.000
and then you just disappeared.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.667
And, believe me, I get
the no-text fade-away.

17:02.750 --> 17:06.583
I just did it last week
with my podiatrist.

17:06.667 --> 17:08.125
But we both know that
weekend was different.

17:08.208 --> 17:10.208
Ask any piece of furniture
in that cabin,

17:10.291 --> 17:12.000
and they'll tell you
the same thing.

17:12.417 --> 17:13.333
On that note,

17:13.417 --> 17:16.667
I'm going home to drink.

17:16.750 --> 17:21.208
Ah. This is fuller.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.792
(sighs)
You know, I'm a
big fan of Edie's,

17:23.875 --> 17:26.500

parenting is mostly waking up,

17:26.583 --> 17:29.333
working, and then fishing all
your stuff out of the toilet.

17:29.417 --> 17:30.917
Tyra never said

17:31.000 --> 17:33.208

mess up your kid like this.

We've tried everything.

17:36.375 --> 17:39.458
Well, not everything.

17:46.083 --> 17:47.417
and Daddy's things
down the toilet?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.208
Yeah, what's got you so upset?

17:49.291 --> 17:51.291
Toilet hungry.

17:51.375 --> 17:52.709
Toilet hungry?

17:52.792 --> 17:55.917
(laughter)

17:56.000 --> 17:57.375
(laughing)

17:57.458 --> 17:59.875
I guess we're not inflicting

17:59.959 --> 18:02.375
lifelong damage on our
daughter after all.

18:02.458 --> 18:03.625
(giggling)

18:03.709 --> 18:05.750
Are we the most
awesome parents ever?

18:05.834 --> 18:08.083
Yeah, I don't think there's any
other way to interpret it.

18:08.166 --> 18:09.917
But to be honest,
I'm barely paying attention

18:10.000 --> 18:12.417
because your robe's
half-open.
Uh!

18:12.500 --> 18:14.250
Uh. Oh. Oh!
You!

18:14.333 --> 18:16.417
(laughing)

18:16.500 --> 18:18.041
You get Mama.
Get Mama. Get her.
Oh, no.

18:18.125 --> 18:20.125
Get her! Get her!
Uh-uh. No!

18:20.208 --> 18:24.417
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

18:24.500 --> 18:26.959
Is it just me,
or do those two belong together?

18:27.041 --> 18:29.417
They do. They're just
too emotionally stunted

18:29.500 --> 18:30.959
to do anything about it.

18:31.041 --> 18:34.250
(sighs)
If I'm that stupid
at 25, kill me.

18:34.333 --> 18:36.166
Wait. How old are you?

18:36.250 --> 18:38.375
19.

18:38.458 --> 18:40.125
Oh, Victor, you
need to moisturize.

18:40.208 --> 18:41.500
Whoa!

18:45.667 --> 18:47.500
Hey.

18:48.709 --> 18:52.709
All right, what's wrong?

18:53.959 --> 18:56.000
No, nothing's wrong.
Jimmy,

18:56.083 --> 18:58.583
you're editing yourself
into photos with Kate Middleton,

18:58.667 --> 19:01.625
but your heart's not in it. You
didn't even get rid of William.

19:01.709 --> 19:03.291
JIMMY:
You think most people would

19:03.375 --> 19:05.083
remember what a person
with glasses looks like

19:05.166 --> 19:07.291
if that person suddenly
stopped wearing glasses?

19:07.375 --> 19:08.792
You forgot
someone you slept with,

19:08.875 --> 19:12.291
and it reminded Sara
you're a cad?
No. Maybe.

19:12.375 --> 19:13.583
How did you know that?

19:13.667 --> 19:15.083
None of that's
a deal breaker for her.

19:15.166 --> 19:16.583
I've seen the way
she looks at you.

19:16.667 --> 19:18.208
Nah, she doesn't look at me.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.792
She looks at me?

19:19.875 --> 19:21.417
Listen, I know

19:21.500 --> 19:23.458
you're never gonna admit
to me that you like her,

19:23.542 --> 19:25.625
but if you ever decide
to admit it to yourself,

19:25.709 --> 19:28.583
I wouldn't wait around
to do something about it.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.667
You know what a cad wouldn't do?

19:31.750 --> 19:35.291
Let Sara know tonight wasn't
just fun and games to you.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.500
Hey.

19:45.583 --> 19:48.834
Hey, Craig. Uh, I've got
couch hair and cake on my shirt.

19:48.917 --> 19:50.583
Ignore that.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.667
Look, we didn't really get
a chance to talk tonight,

19:52.750 --> 19:55.458
and I thought you deserved
to know why I disappeared on you

19:55.542 --> 19:57.709
back then.
Okay.

19:57.792 --> 20:00.500
I must have written and deleted

20:00.583 --> 20:02.500
20 different texts to you
since that weekend.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.917
I guess I just thought
if I saw you again,

20:05.000 --> 20:06.625
it would lead
to something serious,

20:06.709 --> 20:09.375
and I didn't know if I was ready
to take that journey.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.083
Look, I could come up
with a bunch of excuses

20:11.166 --> 20:12.542
about the tortured life
of an artist,

20:12.625 --> 20:14.166
or my bone marrow
situation...

20:14.250 --> 20:15.834
What? Are you okay?

20:15.917 --> 20:18.625
Yeah. No, no, that's just
an example of an excuse.

20:18.709 --> 20:20.291
Look, the point is,

20:20.375 --> 20:23.333
I know I don't deserve
another chance,

20:23.417 --> 20:26.041
but I'm still gonna ask for one.

20:49.041 --> 20:51.000
Hey. Uh, I know it's late.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.166
I-I just wanted
to call you and tell you

20:53.250 --> 20:55.208
that I had a really good time
tonight.

20:55.291 --> 20:57.000
And, listen,
next time we do that dance,

20:57.083 --> 20:58.583
I think...

20:58.667 --> 21:00.208
I'm sorry. You know,
now is not the best time.

21:00.291 --> 21:01.709
No, that's okay, darlin'.

21:01.792 --> 21:03.458
