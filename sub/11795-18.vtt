00:02.402 --> 00:04.170
( bell rings )

00:04.204 --> 00:07.273
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:07.307 --> 00:10.143
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:10.176 --> 00:13.079
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:13.113 --> 00:16.483
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.516 --> 00:22.188
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:22.222 --> 00:25.358
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:25.392 --> 00:28.261
   <i>* And my dog ate</i>
   <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:28.294 --> 00:31.231
 <i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
 <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:31.264 --> 00:34.834
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>

00:34.868 --> 00:39.372
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:52.886 --> 00:55.922
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:55.955 --> 00:58.858
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:58.892 --> 01:02.495
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:07.467 --> 01:09.336
 Love is in the air,
 and you'll never guess

01:09.369 --> 01:11.471
who's the hottest couple
at Bayside.

01:12.539 --> 01:14.140
 Nope.
 It's not me and Kelly.

01:14.174 --> 01:17.377
   I mean we're hot
   but these two are sizzling.

01:17.410 --> 01:21.348
  Jessie and Slater?
  Nah, they're a couple
  of ice cubes compared to...

01:23.383 --> 01:25.452
   ( Violet snorts, laughs )

01:28.421 --> 01:31.958
  Oh, Samuel,
  you're such a funny hunk.
  ( giggles )

01:31.991 --> 01:34.094
  Quit it,
  I'm not that funny.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.930
 Here they are,
 Bayside's own love connection.

01:36.963 --> 01:38.998
  Violet and Screech.

01:46.539 --> 01:48.308
   Look at Screech.

01:48.341 --> 01:51.511
 I haven't seen him this happy
 since Mr. Ed was colorized.

01:54.247 --> 01:56.449
 Oh, look at Violet,
 she's got stars in her eyes.

01:56.483 --> 01:57.817
And rocks in her head.

01:57.851 --> 02:02.322
My cat won't even go near
Screech when he has
a fish in his pocket.

02:02.355 --> 02:05.859
  Lisa, leave him alone...
  I think they
  make a cute couple.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.064
 I had a swell time
 at the movies Saturday, Sammy.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.299
  Oh, me too. It was nice
  of your father to drive us,

02:13.333 --> 02:17.303
  but when he takes you places,
  does he always
  wear that uniform?

02:17.337 --> 02:20.340
 That wasn't Daddy,
 that was Edward our chauffeur.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.311
Hey,
we're bowling after school,
you want to come?

02:25.345 --> 02:29.082
 Thanks, Zack, but I
 have Glee Club rehearsal.
 You guys should join!

02:29.082 --> 02:32.152
 - ( Slater groans )
 - Well, uh,
 I'd love to Violet, really...

02:32.185 --> 02:34.521
  But you see I have a conflict
  with detention.

02:34.554 --> 02:37.223
 I had pizza delivered
 to geometry.

02:37.257 --> 02:40.393
The Glee Club is not really
my style, Violet.

02:40.427 --> 02:44.497
 I like more active things...
 Football, wrestling... Jessie.

02:46.299 --> 02:48.335
 Besides, the Glee Club
 is for geeks.

02:50.370 --> 02:54.174
 Well, my parents insist I have
 an extracurricular activity.

02:54.207 --> 02:57.977
   So the Glee Club
   is perfect for me...
   I can hide in the group.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.847
 I'd love to join the Glee Club
 and hide with you, Violet.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.049
 ( snorts, laughs )
 Oh.

03:03.049 --> 03:06.519
 Samuel, maybe our Glee Club
 will win the All-City Sing...

03:06.553 --> 03:09.189
   We can both go
   to the finals in Hawaii.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.491
Hawaii?

03:11.524 --> 03:13.393
Now that's something
to sing about.

03:13.426 --> 03:15.862
  I can't believe
  you talked me
  into this, Preppie.

03:15.895 --> 03:17.263
   I've missed two
   days of wrestling

03:17.297 --> 03:20.233
  to sing four-part harmony
  with three geeks.

03:20.266 --> 03:23.837
 Hey, you're off
 our Christmas list, jock-boy.

03:25.905 --> 03:29.109
  Okay,
  my gleeful glee clubbers,
  places.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.577
   - Slater: Right.
   - Hey, what's up?

03:34.080 --> 03:36.883
Now, let's be bouncy
with our beat.

03:36.916 --> 03:38.351
  ( sneezes )

03:39.586 --> 03:42.188
Off-key, Lisa.
And wait till I start.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.891
Can I move, please?
I don't want to
catch her cold.

03:48.461 --> 03:51.398
  Let's focus,
  fellas and females.

03:51.431 --> 03:54.167
   - Hello, everyone.
   - All: Hey, Mr. Belding.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.103
   - Hi, Tuttle.
   - What are you
   doing on my turf?

03:57.103 --> 03:59.105
   The All-City Sing
   is one week away,

03:59.139 --> 04:03.043
and I would like see what
kind of
progress you're making.

04:03.043 --> 04:06.312
  If needed to be nagged,
  I'd call your wife.

04:10.050 --> 04:13.353
   Okay, Tuttle.
   Let's just see
   what you've got.

04:14.454 --> 04:17.824
Okay, everyone,
"The Civil War Medley."

04:17.857 --> 04:19.526
Ready?

04:19.559 --> 04:22.395
One, two, three, four.

04:22.429 --> 04:26.366
  <i>* When Johnny comes marching</i>
  <i>home again, hoorah, hoorah...</i>

04:26.399 --> 04:29.803
  ( out of tune ) <i>* When Johnny</i>
 <i>comes marching home again...</i>

04:29.836 --> 04:31.438
  <i>* Oh, I wish I was</i>
  <i>in the land of cotton</i>

04:31.471 --> 04:33.973
   <i>* Old times there</i>
   <i>were not forgotten</i>

04:34.074 --> 04:36.209
 <i>* Look away, look away,</i>
 <i>look away, Dixieland *</i>

04:36.242 --> 04:38.278
 ( yells )
 No, no, altos then sopranos!

04:38.311 --> 04:41.581
 ( overlapping noise )

04:41.614 --> 04:44.217
( yells )
Enough, enough!

04:44.250 --> 04:45.452
 Stop!

04:45.485 --> 04:47.854
  <i>* ...Marching home again,</i>
  <i>hoorah, hoorah... *</i>

04:53.093 --> 04:56.129
   - We've come a long way.
   - Tuttle.

04:57.464 --> 05:00.433
 The All-City
 Sing is right here
 at Bayside this year.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.236
 A performance like that could
 embarrass the entire school,

05:03.269 --> 05:05.505
   not to mention the kids.

05:05.538 --> 05:08.274
I'm giving you 48 hours
to shape up...

05:08.308 --> 05:11.444
  Or I'll be forced to withdraw
  this team from
  the competition.

05:13.279 --> 05:15.115
  Come on, Screech,
  we've got to think

05:15.148 --> 05:17.550
  of a plan to make
  the Glee Club sound better.

05:17.584 --> 05:20.353
   Why don't we cut out
   the singing part?

05:20.387 --> 05:22.922
 - ( phone rings )
 - I got it. I got it.

05:25.425 --> 05:26.793
Hello.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.561
   Oh yeah, Violet,
   he's right here.

05:30.196 --> 05:32.065
   Hello, my heart.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.101
Uh-huh.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.538
Okay, hold on.

05:38.571 --> 05:41.341
  Violet got tickets
  to a concert at
  Cal State tonight,

05:41.374 --> 05:42.842
 she wants
 to know if we can go.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.911
  Screech, please.
  We've got to think tonight.

05:44.944 --> 05:47.213
  Violet, please.
  We've got to think tonight.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.315
Oh! I mean,
I'm so sorry, my heart.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.451
   But we can't do it.
   See you tomorrow.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.420
  ( kisses )

05:57.624 --> 05:59.926
   Zack, maybe we should go.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.529
 We could pick up some pointers
 from some real singers.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.464
  What do you mean, my heart?

06:04.497 --> 06:06.433
   Now you got me saying it.

06:06.466 --> 06:10.470
   It's not
   everyday you get to see
   the California Glee Club.

06:10.503 --> 06:13.373
   You're right. Call her back,
   tell her we're going.

06:13.406 --> 06:15.175
  I'm bringing
  something with us.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.043
 We're bringing your underwear?

06:17.043 --> 06:19.846
 No, you nitwit.
 I'm bringing my tape recorder.

06:19.879 --> 06:23.450
Good thing. You don't
have enough underwear
for the entire Glee Club.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.954
  All right, everybody.
  Just do what we practiced.

06:32.158 --> 06:36.896
 The progress
 we've made might not
 be clear to the amateur ear.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.232
   Enough excuses, Tuttle.
   Your time is up.

06:39.265 --> 06:41.468
   Let's just hear
   what you've got.

06:41.501 --> 06:46.373
   Okay, everyone. Remember:
   posture, pitch and pray.

06:50.110 --> 06:55.215
   ( lip syncing )
   <i>* Oh, when</i>
   <i>the saints go marching in</i>

06:55.248 --> 06:59.185
    <i>* Oh, when</i>
    <i>the saints go marching in</i>

06:59.219 --> 07:01.021
    ( perfect harmony )
   <i>* Go marching in</i>

07:01.021 --> 07:06.159
   <i>* Oh, Lord, I want to be</i>
   <i>in that number</i>

07:06.192 --> 07:10.830
    <i>* When</i>
    <i>the saints go marching in</i>

07:10.864 --> 07:15.168
   <i>* Oh, Lord, I want to be</i>
   <i>in that number</i>

07:16.102 --> 07:19.339
 <i>* When the saints go</i>

07:19.372 --> 07:22.342
 <i>* Marching in</i>

07:22.375 --> 07:26.780
 <i>* I want to see</i>
 <i>the saints march in *</i>

07:28.481 --> 07:29.549
 My goodness.

07:29.582 --> 07:33.386
 You sound like
 a completely
 different Glee Club.

07:33.420 --> 07:37.557
   Mr. Tuttle, I was wrong.
   I'm sorry.

07:37.590 --> 07:41.528
   Yes, I'd say you made
   a total fool of yourself.

07:41.561 --> 07:44.931
  - I said I'm sorry.
  - Okay.

07:44.964 --> 07:49.102
   It's clear you're going to
   make Bayside proud
   at the All-City Sing.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.470
  ( cheers )

07:50.503 --> 07:53.340
 - Bring home a winner.
 - Okay.

07:56.142 --> 08:00.013
 Okay...
 I've just witnessed a miracle.

08:00.046 --> 08:03.450
 I'd like to know how
 it was accomplished.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.820
Well, sir, it was a miracle
of modern technology.

08:06.853 --> 08:09.489
 The reason we sound like
 a completely
 different Glee Club,

08:09.522 --> 08:13.026
 is because we were
 a completely
 different Glee Club.

08:13.059 --> 08:16.396
Zachary, that's despicable,
deceitful...

08:16.429 --> 08:18.832
 And I'm delighted you did it!

08:18.865 --> 08:22.369
  All right.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.237
But what are we going to do
in the competition?

08:24.270 --> 08:27.240
 Yeah, we can fool Belding,
 but we'll never
 fool the judges.

08:27.273 --> 08:30.243
 Fear not! Now that you've
 bought me some time,

08:30.276 --> 08:34.047
   I'll have you singing like
   you've never sung before.

08:34.047 --> 08:37.817
 Well, that's good, Mr. Tuttle,
 because we've
 never sung before.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.919
 ( laughing )

08:43.456 --> 08:45.625
Now that the Glee Club
is in the competition,

08:45.658 --> 08:48.194
  Mr. Tuttle and I
  have come up with a plan...

08:48.228 --> 08:51.564
Feature the best singers
and hide everyone else.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.935
Slater,
can you hold the pitch?

08:55.969 --> 08:59.305
   Sure, but someone's
   got to throw me the ball.

08:59.339 --> 09:03.576
  That must be some
  sort of jock joke.
  ( scoffs )

09:03.610 --> 09:06.479
   Settle, singers.
   All right, Kelly.

09:06.513 --> 09:09.716
 - Let's hear you sing a scale.
 - ( Kelly clears throat )

09:09.749 --> 09:15.255
 <i>* Do, re, mi, fa,</i>
 <i>so, la, ti, do *</i>

09:16.723 --> 09:19.259
 Well,
 you got all the words right.

09:20.627 --> 09:21.728
Jessie, you're up next.

09:24.664 --> 09:28.735
  Oh, are we keeping
  you from surgery,
  Dr. Spano?

09:28.768 --> 09:31.237
  Lisa's got a cold
  and I am not going to allow

09:31.271 --> 09:32.806
 her germs to invade my body.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.208
   Come on, Jessie,
   you've got a great voice.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.776
   Don't you want
   to go to Hawaii?

09:36.810 --> 09:39.646
What good will it do me
if I've got pneumonia?

09:39.679 --> 09:42.282
  Look, all we need
  is one good singer.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.684
  Yeah,
  and the rest of us can hum.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.855
  Violet, you're up.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.796
   ( clears throat )

09:58.198 --> 10:00.300
( plays chord )

10:01.267 --> 10:04.237
   <i>* Do, re</i>

10:04.270 --> 10:07.340
   <i>* Mi, fa</i>

10:07.374 --> 10:10.777
   <i>* So, la</i>

10:10.810 --> 10:15.715
  <i>* Ti, do *</i>

10:16.950 --> 10:19.619
 - Whoa.
 - ( murmurs )

10:19.652 --> 10:22.922
 - Try the next octave.
 - Okay.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.492
( chord plays )

10:25.525 --> 10:28.328
   <i>* Do, re</i>

10:28.361 --> 10:30.497
   <i>* Mi, fa</i>

10:30.530 --> 10:32.599
   <i>* So, la</i>

10:32.632 --> 10:35.568
  <i>* Ti, do *</i>

10:35.602 --> 10:39.539
( opera trill )

10:42.976 --> 10:45.712
 Zack: We've got Hawaii
 in the bag.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.981
  Fantastic, Violet!

10:48.014 --> 10:49.816
You're going to
be our soloist.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.888
 Me? In front of the group,
 all by myself?

10:54.921 --> 10:57.490
   No, no, no.
   Please get someone else.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.428
  Screech, old buddy.

11:03.229 --> 11:04.831
   She's your woman.

11:04.864 --> 11:07.634
 Take her out in the hall
 and talk her into it.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.637
 ( sighs )
 Come here, my heart.

11:12.739 --> 11:15.809
But, Samuel,
all those people
will be staring at me.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.678
  My goal in life
  is to blend in.
( giggles )

11:18.712 --> 11:20.780
 Don't worry, Violet.
 You'll be fantastic.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.415
   I'll be right
   there behind you,

11:22.449 --> 11:24.617
   kind of like your nerd
   in shining armor.

11:25.685 --> 11:29.723
- Oh, you promise?
- I promise, my heart.

11:29.756 --> 11:32.459
   All right, I'll do it...
   For you.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.495
   ( Violet sighs, giggles )

11:35.528 --> 11:36.896
Oh, you're such a doll.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.766
 I know my
 parents will like you
 just as much as I do.

11:39.799 --> 11:41.768
They want you
to come to dinner
Saturday night.

11:41.801 --> 11:42.936
 Huh?

11:42.969 --> 11:45.538
 Yeah, they're really eager
 to meet you.

11:45.572 --> 11:49.576
  Oh, I got to run.
  Edward's waiting
  with the limo. Bye.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.417
   Hey, Screech!
   Did you talk her into it?

11:57.450 --> 11:59.552
- Yeah.
- All right. You stud.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.821
 - But I'm in terrible trouble.
 - Why?

12:01.855 --> 12:04.357
   Her parents invited me
   over for dinner.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.394
 They're rich.
 I don't know how I'm
 supposed to act around them.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.362
 Don't worry, we'll help you.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.698
 We'll teach you everything
 you need to fit in.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.502
Screech, if you really want
to get in good
with her mother, say,

12:15.535 --> 12:19.305
"Excuse me.
Has anyone ever told you
look very much like..."

12:19.339 --> 12:23.643
 And then name
 some big movie star.
 Moms always fall for that one.

12:23.677 --> 12:26.846
 Is that why you told my mother
 she looks like Candice Bergen?

12:26.880 --> 12:30.250
 Oh, no.
 That's true.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.622
Hey, Screech.
How did it go?

12:35.655 --> 12:38.658
 - Tell me every single detail.
 - From the beginning.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.630
  Screech:
  <i>I did just what you guys</i>
  <i>told me to do.</i>

12:43.663 --> 12:45.799
   Mrs. Bickerstaff,
   has anyone ever told you

12:45.832 --> 12:47.901
that you look like
Arnold Schwarzenegger?

12:47.934 --> 12:49.803
 ( piano plays discordantly )

12:52.238 --> 12:53.707
   So these are frogs' legs?

12:53.740 --> 12:55.842
   If I eat them
   will I get warts?

12:55.875 --> 12:57.677
   ( pianos plays off-key )

12:58.712 --> 13:00.747
 Why do you call these
 finger-bowls?

13:00.780 --> 13:04.150
 ( slurping )

13:04.184 --> 13:06.286
 Mmm, this lemon soup
 is delicious.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.854
  Can I have seconds?

13:07.887 --> 13:09.823
 Mrs. Bickerstaff,
 where are you going?

13:09.856 --> 13:11.725
   Mrs. Bickerstaff?

13:18.398 --> 13:19.599
  I guess I blew it.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.801
 Screech, I'm sure
 it's not as bad as you think.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.939
   How are my singers today?

13:25.972 --> 13:27.841
  - Zack: Good.
  - Mr. Tuttle: Good.

13:29.676 --> 13:31.878
  And here's my star.

13:31.911 --> 13:34.581
  Violet, you're our ticket
  to Hawaii.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.953
I'm sorry, Mr. Tuttle,
but I'm
quitting the Glee Club.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.256
- All: What?
- Slater:
Quitting the Glee Club?

13:43.289 --> 13:46.359
  She hates me and doesn't want
  to be around me anymore.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.795
   Jessie, it's up to you.
   You've got to take over.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.197
   You're the only one
   with a voice as
   good as Violet's.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.799
   ( strained whisper )
   You want to bet?

13:52.832 --> 13:55.402
 I caught Lisa's cold.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.239
Sorry!

14:02.475 --> 14:06.046
  ( crying )

14:06.046 --> 14:08.248
( whimpering )

14:09.382 --> 14:10.450
 Violet, is that you?

14:10.483 --> 14:12.919
 ( Violets snorts, sniffles )

14:13.453 --> 14:15.055
   Who else?

14:15.055 --> 14:17.791
  ( bawling )

14:19.859 --> 14:23.063
 It's so awful.
 I don't know where to start.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.330
   ( raspy voiced )
   Why don't you start with

14:24.364 --> 14:25.965
 why'd you quit the Glee Club.

14:26.066 --> 14:30.770
  Oh, I'm sorry about that.
  I know I let everyone down.

14:30.804 --> 14:34.074
  It would just be too painful.
  ( snorts )

14:34.107 --> 14:36.943
 Violet, what would be
 too painful?

14:36.976 --> 14:40.814
 Being around Samuel.

14:40.847 --> 14:44.484
 You see, he made a few
 mistakes when he came to
 my house for dinner.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.953
   And you hate him
   because of that?

14:46.986 --> 14:49.756
   ( cries louder, snorts )

14:49.789 --> 14:51.491
 He thinks I hate him?

14:51.524 --> 14:53.927
 Oh, no!
 Poor Samuel.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.829
   Well, yeah.
   The poor dork...

14:55.862 --> 15:00.033
  I... I... I mean the poor
  handsome dork is miserable.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.202
 I have to tell him the truth.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.070
( snorts and sniffles )

15:10.276 --> 15:13.113
 Zack, I'm sorry I drove
 Violet out of the Glee Club,

15:13.146 --> 15:15.181
 and ruined our chances
 for Hawaii.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.183
 That's okay, Screech.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.219
   I'm just sorry
   you lost your girlfriend.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.254
   Thanks. Me, too.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.291
Violet!

15:29.062 --> 15:30.830
Zack, can we be alone?

15:30.864 --> 15:32.198
Screech: Okay, Violet.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.836
Not with me,
she wants to be
alone with you.

15:44.511 --> 15:47.080
  Samuel,
  after you left last night,

15:47.080 --> 15:49.983
  my parents forbid me
  to go out with you anymore.

15:52.085 --> 15:55.889
   It would just be too painful
   seeing you in Glee Club.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.091
 But, Violet,
 I should be the one to quit.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.226
 I only joined to be with you.

16:00.260 --> 16:03.897
 Oh, Samuel, I couldn't perform
 in public
 without you behind me.

16:03.930 --> 16:07.434
I don't have to be standing
on the bleachers
to be behind you.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.369
  I'll always be behind you.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.875
 ( choir sings in background )

16:17.143 --> 16:19.946
Gee, Valley's Glee Club
is pretty good.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.548
Aw, don't worry
about it, Kelly.

16:21.581 --> 16:26.052
 While we're in Hawaii, they'll
 still be "down by the old
 mill stream." For sure.

16:29.923 --> 16:31.191
Violet: Samuel.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.227
 I just wanted to let you
 know that I'm here...

16:34.260 --> 16:36.262
 And I wanted to give you this.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.431
 Oh...

16:42.068 --> 16:44.137
 Violet, what are you doing
 with that boy?

16:44.170 --> 16:45.505
  ( nervously )
  Mom... Dad.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.240
 What are you doing backstage?

16:47.273 --> 16:50.410
 We wanted to wish you
 good luck before you perform.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.345
   Young man,
   please excuse us.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.748
 Well, sure,
 I didn't even hear you burp.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.288
 Violet,
 we're very disappointed
 that you chose to disobey us.

17:02.322 --> 17:05.290
- But, Dad, he was
just... He...
- No, no.

17:05.325 --> 17:08.361
  - ( applause )
  - Kids, line up. We're on.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.501
  We'll continue
  this conversation at home.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.839
   ( sobs )

17:24.044 --> 17:26.279
 ( whispers )
 Mr. Tuttle, Violet's not here.

17:26.311 --> 17:27.446
  What? Where is she?

17:27.480 --> 17:29.749
I bet I know.
Bathroom, first stall.

17:29.783 --> 17:32.419
   Great. What do I do
   in the meantime?

17:32.452 --> 17:34.454
 You heard her, stall... Stall.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.392
 Good evening.

17:39.426 --> 17:44.197
 We're going to
 begin our program
 with a Stephen Foster medley.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.767
   For those of you
   who aren't
   familiar with the term...

17:47.801 --> 17:49.936
   Time out!

17:49.969 --> 17:52.772
 Fortunately, I always have
 a backup plan.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.741
  Excuse me.

17:57.477 --> 18:00.013
 Screech, hook up this tape
 to the sound system.

18:00.013 --> 18:02.015
 Okay, Zack,
 but I'm not sure how it works.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.249
  Just do it.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.421
   ( clears throat )

18:08.455 --> 18:11.191
   Time in.

18:11.224 --> 18:15.028
   - ( whispers )
   - Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

18:15.028 --> 18:19.032
  Now, we're going to sing
  that rousing jazz classic,

18:19.065 --> 18:22.235
<i>When the Saints</i>
<i>Go Marching In.</i>

18:24.838 --> 18:27.774
   ( tape play fast )
   <i>* When the saints</i>
   <i>go marching in</i>

18:27.807 --> 18:29.442
 <i>* Oh, when the saints</i>
 <i>go marching in</i>

18:29.476 --> 18:31.878
  <i>* Oh, Lord, I want</i>
  <i>to be in that number</i>

18:31.911 --> 18:34.180
 <i>* When the saints</i>
 <i>go marching in</i>

18:34.214 --> 18:36.816
  <i>* Oh, Lord, I want</i>
  <i>to be in that number</i>

18:36.850 --> 18:38.752
   <i>* When the saints</i>
   <i>go marching in... *</i>

18:38.785 --> 18:40.053
  What are you doing?

18:41.788 --> 18:46.259
  ( extra slow )
 <i>* Oh, when the saints</i>

18:46.292 --> 18:49.929
 <i>* Go marching in... *</i>

18:49.963 --> 18:52.332
   Tuttle, what is going on?

18:52.365 --> 18:55.268
   <i>- * Oh, when the saints...</i>
    - Screech?

18:55.301 --> 18:58.371
 <i>* - Go marching... *</i>
  - ( extremely fast singing )

19:04.744 --> 19:05.845
Let me explain.

19:05.879 --> 19:08.014
That was our...

19:08.048 --> 19:11.351
   That was our impression
   of a Glee Club tuning up.

19:15.021 --> 19:19.025
 And now, for some real singing
 with our featured soloist

19:19.025 --> 19:21.027
  Violet Bickerstaff.

19:29.235 --> 19:31.438
   All: <i>* Bom, bom</i>

19:33.473 --> 19:35.442
 <i>* Bom, bom *</i>

19:35.475 --> 19:37.744
   ( whispers )
   Violet, that's your cue.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.247
  <i>* Bom, bom</i>

19:42.816 --> 19:46.052
   ( wavering )
  <i>* Beautiful</i>

19:46.052 --> 19:49.456
   <i>* Dreamer</i>

19:50.457 --> 19:55.929
<i>* Wake unto me</i>

19:55.962 --> 19:57.263
 <i>* Bom</i>

19:58.164 --> 20:03.103
  <i>* Starlight and dewdrops...</i>

20:08.541 --> 20:11.511
<i>* Are waiting for thee</i>

20:11.544 --> 20:13.279
  <i>* Bom, bom</i>

20:13.313 --> 20:17.450
   ( off-key )
  <i>* Sounds of the rude world</i>

20:17.484 --> 20:21.221
  <i>* Heard in the day</i>

20:21.254 --> 20:22.455
 <i>* Bom</i>

20:22.489 --> 20:26.092
  <i>* By the moonlight</i>

20:26.126 --> 20:30.330
<i>* Have all passed away</i>

20:30.363 --> 20:32.232
  <i>* Bom, bom</i>

20:32.265 --> 20:37.303
   <i>* Starlight and dewdrops</i>

20:37.337 --> 20:43.043
<i>* Are waiting for thee</i>

20:44.077 --> 20:49.883
  <i>* Beautiful dreamer</i>

20:49.916 --> 20:56.089
 <i>* Awake unto</i>

20:56.122 --> 20:59.859
 <i>- * Me</i>
 - All: <i>* Bom *</i>

20:59.893 --> 21:03.296
 ( applause, cheers )

21:05.198 --> 21:08.468
  Screech,
  what you did for Violet
  was very romantic.

21:08.501 --> 21:12.072
  Yeah, Screech.
  We would've been
  lost if it wasn't for you.

21:12.105 --> 21:15.108
  I'm just sorry
  things aren't going
  to work between you and...

21:16.443 --> 21:17.844
Violet!

21:19.245 --> 21:20.847
   And your parents.

21:22.916 --> 21:25.785
   Young man, we saw you rescue
   our daughter tonight.

21:25.819 --> 21:30.957
 And we no longer object to you
 and Violet seeing each other.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.759
Slater: Hey, all right.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.928
  All right, Screech.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.497
 Samuel, you're welcome
 at our house anytime.

21:37.530 --> 21:40.100
   - Except for dinnertime.
   - ( all laugh )

21:47.140 --> 21:50.143
 ( instrumental music plays )
