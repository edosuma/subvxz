14:03.717 --> 14:06.220
Only public spaces and the med bay.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.305
As I told you, this is me

14:08.389 --> 14:11.016
receiving treatment from Eva.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.437
Life extension therapy.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.486
The scan extends to approximately

14:22.570 --> 14:25.322
ten meters beyond the outer walls.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.580
Oh, shit.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.752
Sorry.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.838
I should've protected you from that.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.846
So, um...

14:48.929 --> 14:51.307
so you have...

14:51.390 --> 14:56.312
um, everyone's locations
in the common areas and outside?

14:56.395 --> 14:58.898
We do, except for a few minutes

14:58.981 --> 15:02.359
at 11:59 when the system
does an auto backup.

15:02.443 --> 15:05.446
The exact time the killer chose to strike.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.408
So they're an insider to security.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.706
Can I see 11:30 p.m.?

15:15.789 --> 15:17.791
Sure. Ray?

15:17.875 --> 15:19.293
[Ray] Yes, Andy?

15:19.376 --> 15:21.754
Screen through the 11:30 p.m. lidar scan.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.934
So Lee, Lu Mei,

15:35.017 --> 15:36.852
Martin and Marius

15:36.936 --> 15:39.396
are all playing poker in the dining room

15:39.480 --> 15:42.566
from 10:30 p.m. until the 1:00 a.m. scan.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.027
We can't rule them out completely

15:45.110 --> 15:46.862
because of the chunk of missing time.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.197
Right?

15:48.280 --> 15:50.407
Ray?

15:50.491 --> 15:52.451
Would you put on
the screen images of the guests

15:52.534 --> 15:54.536
and all of the staff?

15:55.663 --> 15:57.998
And, Ray, would you rule out
any of the staff

15:58.082 --> 16:00.000
whose door cam footage
shows that they entered

16:00.084 --> 16:01.669
their rooms, but didn't leave?

16:01.752 --> 16:04.171
Sorry, Darby.
That's not public information.

16:04.254 --> 16:07.007
Ray, rule out the staff whose cameras

16:07.091 --> 16:09.510
show that they entered their room
and did not leave

16:09.593 --> 16:12.805
between 11:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.890
Certainly, Andy.

16:18.727 --> 16:21.188
Do you have anyone else's alibi?

16:21.271 --> 16:23.399
Tomas in the kitchen

16:23.482 --> 16:25.275
from 11:15 p.m. until he turned up

16:25.359 --> 16:26.944
at Bill's door.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.905
We've got no hard evidence
for anybody else.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.949
Whoever did this

16:32.032 --> 16:34.827
-also hacked Rohan's pacemaker.
-Sian's suit.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.870
And deleted themselves
from Bill's door cam footage.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.415
I mean, Todd doesn't
have the skills for that.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.209
-And Ziba's not a secret hacker.
-No.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.420
[chuckles]

16:44.503 --> 16:46.505
David?

16:47.923 --> 16:50.009
I think David was in the hall.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.885
Ray, um...

16:51.969 --> 16:56.557
can you screen the 12:06 a.m. scan
and look for David Alvarez?

17:02.312 --> 17:03.605
Wait, no.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.815
That's weird.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.026
Standing in the hall isn't a crime.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.111
No, but David was in the hallway

17:09.194 --> 17:11.238
when Eva led me out of Bill's room.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.157
And that was 12:15.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.992
So what was David doing

17:15.075 --> 17:16.952
in the hall for the ten minutes

17:17.036 --> 17:19.288
when Sian was trying to revive Bill?

17:25.669 --> 17:27.421
I don't know why
you didn't call me sooner.

17:27.504 --> 17:29.423
We're in the middle of an epic bukkake.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.010
What's this?

17:33.093 --> 17:35.054
We need to ask you a few questions.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.139
"We"?

17:37.222 --> 17:38.515
This a joke?

17:38.599 --> 17:40.059
[Andy] No.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.144
I don't know why you're indulging
a non-player character

17:42.227 --> 17:44.146
like Darby when we should
be on the phone to K2

17:44.229 --> 17:46.273
or Black Rock trying to save our asses.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.358
I'm not sure your ass is on the line.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.985
I'm the one that's leveraged to the hilt,

17:50.069 --> 17:52.905
and there's only you and Lee knows that.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.239
Darby.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.077
Um...

17:59.244 --> 18:01.080
So the night that Bill was killed,

18:01.163 --> 18:02.956
um, I bumped into the waiter,

18:03.040 --> 18:04.917
Tomas, in the hall.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.127
And then Eva took me

18:07.211 --> 18:09.296
back to my room.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.215
And you appeared in the hall

18:11.298 --> 18:13.884
just as that was happening.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.969
What were you doing?

18:19.056 --> 18:21.600
I was, uh, I was going
to another guest's room.

18:21.683 --> 18:22.893
Whose?

18:22.976 --> 18:24.603
I don't fucking have to answer that.

18:24.686 --> 18:27.481
It think it would be best,
David, if you did.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.362
Oliver's.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.697
After midnight?

18:35.781 --> 18:37.366
I'm on New York time.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.076
[Andy] Are you trying to poach my talent?

18:39.159 --> 18:40.744
[David] "Poach your talent"?

18:40.828 --> 18:42.538
We're on the same fucking team.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.415
[Darby] Um, there are other things
that people do

18:45.499 --> 18:48.335
at midnight besides corporate espionage.

18:48.418 --> 18:50.295
I'm not saying

18:50.379 --> 18:52.339
another word without Mark.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.508
-[Darby] Who's Mark?
-His lawyer.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.719
[Oliver] Yeah, David and I fucked.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.431
Your mouth dropping
because you don't think

19:01.515 --> 19:04.059
disabled guys can fuck?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.394
Oliver...

19:05.477 --> 19:07.437
could you talk us through
what happened that night?

19:07.521 --> 19:09.690
Well, uh, the first time

19:09.773 --> 19:11.483
we had sex was in David's room.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.694
That was probably around 11:30.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.113
He got a call, seemed kind of distracted.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.031
Then he told me I had to go.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.491
So I did.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.702
Half hour later, he's knocking on my door.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.203
Says he wants to go again.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.580
[Darby] What was he like?

19:24.663 --> 19:26.874
-His mood?
-Flustered.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.834
But horny.

19:28.917 --> 19:31.128
Did you ask him what was on his mind?

19:31.211 --> 19:33.463
Why he was so agitated?

19:33.547 --> 19:35.382
No.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.759
But he talked a lot about Lu Mei.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.928
Thinks she's a Chinese spy or something.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.972
I told him he was racist.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.601
Wait, so you were actually alone

19:45.684 --> 19:47.436
at midnight when Bill was killed?

19:47.519 --> 19:49.271
[Oliver chuckles]

19:49.354 --> 19:52.232
Look, I thought Bill

19:52.316 --> 19:54.401
was a phony moral crusader.

19:54.484 --> 19:57.279
It's easy to be a luddite
when you're a handsome,

19:57.362 --> 19:59.656
able-bodied white guy with charisma.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.742
But I didn't kill the guy.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.204
Your sneakers.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.289
Um...

20:07.372 --> 20:10.083
the tread on the bottom is pretty worn.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.712
You're not paralyzed, right?

20:14.838 --> 20:16.924
Like, you can walk if you have to?

20:18.008 --> 20:20.052
Not very far.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.596
And not for very long.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.271
I had planned to share this with you.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.398
I figured, at some point, you'd tell me

20:33.482 --> 20:36.401
why you invited me here,
and we'd have a drink together.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.782
I'm sorry, Lu Mei. This has been a...

20:41.865 --> 20:44.451
-a very difficult time.
-[Lu Mei] I survived

20:44.534 --> 20:46.870
the Cultural Revolution,
I'm going to survive this.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.581
So are you.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.168
Uh, after the baths,

20:53.252 --> 20:56.838
I played poker
with your wife and the filmmaker.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.216
Lee is quite the poker player.

20:59.299 --> 21:01.385
She took a lot of my money.

21:02.469 --> 21:04.429
We played from 11:00

21:04.513 --> 21:07.182
to about 1:00 a.m.,

21:07.266 --> 21:09.393
and, uh, then I went directly to bed.

21:09.476 --> 21:11.645
Did anyone leave the table
during that time?

21:11.728 --> 21:15.440
The table, for sure, but not the room.

21:15.524 --> 21:19.236
Except... maybe Lee once.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.405
I had a bit to drink.

21:21.488 --> 21:24.616
You have hacking skills, right, Lu Mei?

21:28.662 --> 21:32.165
I'm not the brains of my operation.
I'm the brawn.

21:32.249 --> 21:35.085
No, but you build smart cities

21:35.168 --> 21:37.296
run by computers, so,

21:37.379 --> 21:40.048
must know a bit about 'em.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.135
-All right.
-[sets drink on table]

21:45.721 --> 21:48.974
After Rohan, I became alarmed.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.977
I hacked through the firewall.

21:52.060 --> 21:54.438
I wanted to see
if I could reach my security team

21:54.521 --> 21:56.523
in Siglufjördur, and, uh,

21:56.606 --> 21:59.651
have them arrange an evacuation for me

21:59.735 --> 22:02.904
to get me the hell out of this place.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.073
But I couldn't reach them.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.451
Thanks for your honesty.

22:07.534 --> 22:10.704
I've come down here
because I want to help.

22:10.787 --> 22:14.249
And I will help you, Andy,
even after we get out of here.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.918
My team has developed a software

22:17.002 --> 22:20.422
to keep the residents
of our smart cities safe.

22:20.505 --> 22:23.383
It looks for patterns
in mental health records,

22:23.467 --> 22:25.510
criminal records, cell phone data

22:25.594 --> 22:27.888
to create profiles that

22:27.971 --> 22:29.723
anticipate criminal behavior.

22:30.807 --> 22:33.894
Clearly, something like that
could have been useful here.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.397
Wouldn't you say?

22:48.617 --> 22:50.660
I think we should talk to Lee next.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.245
Why?

22:52.329 --> 22:54.498
Well, Lu Mei said
she left the poker game.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.876
-She could have seen something.
-No. She would have told me.

22:57.959 --> 23:00.504
What we need to do
is to track down that call

23:00.587 --> 23:02.756
that came into David's room. Ray,

23:02.839 --> 23:04.758
could you go through the list of calls

23:04.841 --> 23:07.803
that came into David Alvarez's
room on February the third.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.971
[Ray] There are two incoming calls.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.766
The front desk called at 9:15.

23:12.849 --> 23:15.394
The call was unanswered. At 11:07,

23:15.477 --> 23:17.396
there was an incoming call to David.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.147
Who from?

23:19.231 --> 23:21.233
The call came from William Farrah's room.

23:23.568 --> 23:24.653
Bill called David?

23:24.736 --> 23:27.239
Um, Ray, how long was the call?

23:27.322 --> 23:28.990
27 seconds.

23:31.701 --> 23:34.162
Bill didn't even know David, did he?

23:34.246 --> 23:36.998
Um, do you guys keep transcripts of calls?

23:37.082 --> 23:39.000
No, not unless
something dangerous is said,

23:39.084 --> 23:40.585
which triggers a recording.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.004
Andy?

23:43.088 --> 23:44.464
-No, not now.
-Andy,

23:44.548 --> 23:45.966
I think you should take this one.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.384
It's The Wall Street Journal.

23:47.467 --> 23:48.885
They know Rohan's dead.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.387
They know we're stuck here.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.389
-How?
-They're on the SAP repeater.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.933
How do they know?

23:55.016 --> 23:56.601
Who told them?

23:56.685 --> 23:57.853
I-I don't know.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.688
Who do you think told them?

24:00.981 --> 24:04.067
[shouting] What... is fucking wrong

24:04.151 --> 24:05.569
with people?!

24:05.652 --> 24:08.447
I cannot trust a single

24:08.530 --> 24:10.740
fucking person!

24:30.427 --> 24:32.929
Hello?

24:33.013 --> 24:36.266
Hey, Susan. It's Andy.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.977
Yeah. It's true.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.563
[indistinct, distant chatter]

25:10.217 --> 25:13.428
[faint wailing]

25:24.356 --> 25:27.776
[wailing grows louder]

25:38.078 --> 25:40.497
[recorded whale sounds playing]

25:54.511 --> 25:56.596
[quietly] Did you figure anything out?

25:56.680 --> 25:58.807
No.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.643
Well, yeah, I... I don't know.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.645
It's like I have
all the edges of the puzzle,

26:03.728 --> 26:06.982
but nothing in the middle, you know?

26:07.065 --> 26:08.900
Hey, can I ask you something?

26:08.984 --> 26:10.986
Yeah, of course.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.780
Lu Mei said you disappeared
from the poker game.

26:13.863 --> 26:15.907
Where'd you go?

26:15.991 --> 26:18.368
I went to check on Zoomer.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.537
Do you know what time that was exactly?

26:21.705 --> 26:24.457
Um... I don't know.

26:24.541 --> 26:28.169
Uh, it was probably a little after 11:00.

26:28.253 --> 26:32.716
And you didn't notice
anything strange around, or off?

26:33.967 --> 26:36.469
I took the elevator in the medical bay.

26:36.553 --> 26:39.097
There wasn't anyone in the hall.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.268
Where's Andy?

26:43.351 --> 26:45.353
Um, on the phone.

26:45.437 --> 26:49.065
Look, Lee, um, I owe you an apology.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.486
there is no trace of her.

01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:41.572
And get this: he was then put on probation

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:43.199
for discharging a weapon without cause

01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:46.119
and then given early retirement.

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:49.664
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

01:01:49.747 --> 01:01:52.250
And I have an address.

01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:54.085
Whose?

01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:55.712
His.

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:58.965
I have his last-known address
where he lived with Patricia.

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:01.926
And it's currently for sale,
so it's standing open.

01:02:03.678 --> 01:02:06.681
Are you saying we should...

01:02:06.764 --> 01:02:09.434
we should go to the house
to see if Patricia Bell never left?

01:02:11.519 --> 01:02:13.938
That's why I like you so much.

01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:17.734

I mean, you can see for yourself.

No, I mean, a-are you
on something right now?

01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:37.962
Yeah, Adderall.
I'm... I was on a roll, so...

01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:40.882
-Where'd you get Adderall?
-At a truck stop.

01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:47.555

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:51.058
Okay. [laughs softly]

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.061
Yeah?

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:59.150
I think we should go home. I...

01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:02.278
I think you might be losing it, Darbs.

01:03:02.361 --> 01:03:03.946
What?

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:05.573
Losing it? I-I've found it.

01:03:05.656 --> 01:03:08.367
I've fucking found everything.

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.203
What, is this because it wasn't
your break or something?

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:11.621
No, I could give a fuck.

01:03:11.704 --> 01:03:13.998
What, you just don't care anymore?

01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:16.501
No, of course I care,
I'm just worried about you.

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:19.086
I mean, you... since Utah,
you're not here anymore.

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:22.006
You're just on the case
the whole time. It's...

01:03:22.089 --> 01:03:24.550
It's alarming, I mean,
you're taking uppers, taking downers.

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.385
You're not sleeping, not eating.

01:03:27.428 --> 01:03:28.387
Y-You're ready to break into

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:29.388
a potential serial killer's house

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:30.807
to, what, to save them?

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:33.351
I mean, you can't. They're dead.

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:40.399
You know what? I really...

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:43.027
I really thought you were different.

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:44.612
But maybe you're
just like everything else.

01:03:44.695 --> 01:03:46.656
-"Everything"?
-Everyone else.

01:03:46.739 --> 01:03:48.449
You need sleep, Darby.

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:51.536
After 48 hours,
brain function starts to fail. Uh...

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:53.996
So, what, so are you gonna,
what, take me to a spa?

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.039
Check me into an asylum?

01:03:55.122 --> 01:03:56.958
I mean, fuck,
there's good precedent for that.

01:03:57.041 --> 01:03:58.626
All the millions of women
who have been locked up

01:03:58.709 --> 01:04:00.878
because they dare to think differently.

01:04:00.962 --> 01:04:02.296
I mean, what's next,
are you gonna chop off

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.382
-part of my brain or something?
-Ugh, a lobotomy?

01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:06.300
Jesus, that's not what I meant,
Darby, you know that.

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:08.094
-I'm not going home.
-Okay, well, I'm not going

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:11.222
-to a serial killer's house--
-Former house, Bill. Former.

01:04:11.305 --> 01:04:12.348
Also, don't you think
some of this has come

01:04:12.431 --> 01:04:15.017
-a little too easily?
-Easily?

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:17.186
-Fuck, I mean, if this was easy, then...
-Okay, all right, not easy,

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:19.063
but, uh, it just feels like
we're picking up breadcrumbs

01:04:19.146 --> 01:04:21.148
deliberately left to be found.

01:04:21.232 --> 01:04:23.234
I have a feeling this guy's
dying for company.

01:04:23.317 --> 01:04:25.194
He-he wants to be seen so bad,
and I-I don't want to see him.

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:27.530
So you're just, you're gonna go home?

01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:29.156
-No.
-'Cause you're chickenshit.

hunts down and destroys women?

someone die unnamed and unacknowledged,

we're basically saying we're okay with it.

is just a fucking mass grave

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:43.254
and everyone's okay with it, but I'm not.

01:04:43.337 --> 01:04:44.422
-I don't want to be okay with it.
-Darby, Darby, Darby.

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:48.926
I'll get the towel.

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:51.804
-Fuck. Oh, my God.
-Oh...

for you to love me.

Will you enable projection?

01:06:35.032 --> 01:06:37.868
I think I need to talk to someone.

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:40.579
You can talk to me, Darby.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.207
I...

01:06:45.209 --> 01:06:47.878
I don't think I want to be awake anymore.

01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:52.550
Everything hurts.

Why does everything hurt, Darby?

I think it's hurt
for as long as I can remember, really.

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:08.399
That sounds painful.

01:07:08.482 --> 01:07:11.235
Why don't you tell me more about it?

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:21.078
Um, I think life's like a Brillo pad.

01:07:23.247 --> 01:07:26.584
And it rubs your skin away.

So you don't really notice
at first, and then...

01:07:35.926 --> 01:07:41.223
And then, one day, it all comes at once.

01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:46.937
And you realize
you don't have any skin left.

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:52.610
And there's nothing
between you and the world anymore.

01:07:52.693 --> 01:07:54.904
You've got no skin.

01:07:54.987 --> 01:07:58.741
