He set off on a seven-month
tour of Europe,

35:18.167 --> 35:20.333
the Middle East,
and the Soviet Union,

35:20.500 --> 35:23.125
meeting with leaders,
diplomats,

35:23.292 --> 35:25.958
and everyday people
to gather information

35:26.042 --> 35:29.208
about the growing threat

35:29.375 --> 35:31.542
Jack's journey began in London

35:31.667 --> 35:34.208

with Princess Elizabeth.

35:34.375 --> 35:36.708
Then he was off
to Eastern Europe,

35:36.875 --> 35:39.000
stopping in Warsaw, Poland.

35:39.167 --> 35:42.042
As he traveled,
he often corresponded

35:42.208 --> 35:44.917
with Lem Billings
and reported his observations

35:45.042 --> 35:46.375
back to his father.

35:48.375 --> 35:49.792
- Bye, Rosie.

Torby Macdonald.

They crossed into
Nazi Germany and were heckled

36:02.375 --> 36:04.542
by local stormtroopers
who believed

36:04.625 --> 36:09.333
they were disrespecting
the statue of a Nazi hero.

Days later,

his near-death experience.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.583
