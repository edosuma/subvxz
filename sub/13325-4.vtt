WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:04.436
Is sam still out
with your dad?

00:04.438 --> 00:06.405
It's been
almost six hours.

00:06.407 --> 00:07.740
Maybe he took her
to the mall again.

00:07.742 --> 00:10.209
I mean, for a guy his age,
that's like three hours

00:10.211 --> 00:13.712
To find a parking spot
and three more hours
to back out.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.115
Actually, I think he was
taking her to long beach

00:16.117 --> 00:21.420
Oh, well, then she's
probably just waiting for
the adrenaline to wear off.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.455
He's monopolizing
all her time.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.591
It's not fair to sam.
She's not me.

00:25.593 --> 00:28.360
I'm good at making up excuses
and I'm running out.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.530
I mean, how many quinceañeras
can one white lady go to?

00:32.732 --> 00:34.767
I thought you guys loved
hanging out with my dad.

00:34.769 --> 00:38.303
No, we do it because
his wife kicked him out
and he's lonely.

00:38.305 --> 00:40.272
But we can only
take so much.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.174
I mean, you've got to
do something about it.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.409
What am I supposed to do?

00:43.411 --> 00:46.278
I grew up with the guy.
I did my time.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.780
Well, sam's 15.

00:47.782 --> 00:49.815
She should be up
in her room hating us,

00:49.817 --> 00:52.317
Listening to some
super sincere

00:52.319 --> 00:55.788
Neo-folk bearded
jug band bs.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.491
What happened
to metal, charlie?

00:59.493 --> 01:02.194
What a day.
What a day.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.829
Hey, you're back.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.831
- Did you see the ships?
- We saw the ships.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.400
We visited a cemetery
for war veterans.

01:08.402 --> 01:12.271
We read a terrific brochure
about california's
largest flag.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.273
And what was
the best part, sam?

01:14.275 --> 01:16.775
Hard to beat the cemetery.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.311
No, the best part
is we're going out
again tonight.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.747
I'm taking sam to
a little italian restaurant

01:21.749 --> 01:25.117
I discovered where
all the waiters sing
bobby darin songs.

01:25.119 --> 01:26.852
"splish splash."
you want to go
with us, jen?

01:26.854 --> 01:28.787
Tonight?
Oh, I can't.

01:28.789 --> 01:32.091
I got my online
banjo lessons.

01:32.093 --> 01:34.426
You should play
for us sometime.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.563
All right, I'm gonna
go home for a nap,

01:37.565 --> 01:39.731
And then I'll be back
to pick you up
at 6:30 sharp.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.834
Be there or be square.

01:41.836 --> 01:43.735
Bye-bye, sweetheart.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.638
Oh.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.109
Sam, you know you
don't have to go out
with grandpa again tonight.

01:50.111 --> 01:52.377
Or ever, really.

01:52.379 --> 01:56.315
But he's my grandpa.
I mean, who knows how much
time he has left?

01:56.317 --> 01:58.884
I know.
The suspense
is killing me.

02:01.888 --> 02:04.490
Okay, we still have
a few minutes left.
Anybody have anything?

02:04.492 --> 02:08.393
Well, if I'm being
totally honest,

02:08.395 --> 02:11.263
I'm a little worried
I've been smoking too much
pot lately.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.732
Nolan, if I'm being
totally honest,

02:13.734 --> 02:16.702
You just said the exact
same thing 10 minutes ago.

02:17.770 --> 02:18.837
Anybody else?

02:18.839 --> 02:22.808
Okay, there's
this douchebag

02:22.810 --> 02:24.343
Who tormented me
in high school

02:24.345 --> 02:25.911
And, according to
my schedule at work,

02:25.913 --> 02:27.913
He's coming in
for a fashion consultation.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.715
It may not even
be the same guy.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.885
Could be some
random non-douchebag
with the same name.

02:32.887 --> 02:34.820
He's a mexican jew

02:34.822 --> 02:38.157
And his name
is gonzalo rosenblatt.

02:38.159 --> 02:40.325
You were saying?

02:40.327 --> 02:42.761
Give me five minutes
and I'll show you

02:42.763 --> 02:44.763
How to sever
his achilles tendon

02:44.765 --> 02:47.766
With a credit card
and a ballpoint pen.

02:47.768 --> 02:51.236
Ed, I am already here because
of an incident at work.

02:51.238 --> 02:52.871
If he starts in,
I'm gonna lose it.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.740
And if that happens again,
I'm out of a job.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.808
You're just being
dramatic, patrick.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.478
You were probably
an insignificant bug
to this guy.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.580
I bet he doesn't
even remember you
from high school.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.782
I bet <i>nobody</i> remembers you
from high school.

03:03.784 --> 03:07.619
You can now get back
to the top of your slutty
christmas tree.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.925
I think what lacey
is trying to say is--

03:12.927 --> 03:15.227
No, even I can't
save that one.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.796
Lacey, you just
bought yourself a job

03:17.798 --> 03:21.200
I want you there for him when
this guy comes in the store.

03:21.202 --> 03:23.402
- What does it pay?
- It doesn't pay anything.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.836
You're there
to support patrick.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.471
Oh, what does that pay?

03:26.473 --> 03:29.741
Tell you what,
you see a pair
of shoes you like,

03:29.743 --> 03:32.244
- I will look the other way.
- I'm there.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.879
Patrick, that's not
gonna happen.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.415
Come on, I was
obviously kidding.

03:39.352 --> 03:40.919
I saw that.

03:42.855 --> 03:44.957
Ed, you were gonna find
a hobby as a way

03:44.959 --> 03:47.826
To bring some joy
back in your life.
Any luck with that?

03:47.828 --> 03:49.628
Well, I was looking
for a choir group

03:49.630 --> 03:52.564
Like I was in
in texas, but the wife
wouldn't have it.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.765
You sing?

03:53.767 --> 03:56.768
Like a goddamn angel.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.838
I sing.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.308
Not out loud,
obviously.

04:04.877 --> 04:06.712
Ed, what kind
of stuff did you sing?

04:06.714 --> 04:09.848
Well, it was
a heritage choir.
We sang folk songs.

04:09.850 --> 04:13.585
You know, things like
"that old cotton field
back home"

04:13.587 --> 04:16.588
And "big old shiny smile."

04:16.590 --> 04:19.791
Ed, those songs sound
horribly racist and offensive.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.960
Oh, no.
It's real americana.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.863
♪ old jim dandy
dancing in the streets ♪

04:24.865 --> 04:27.299
♪ folks come
from miles around ♪

04:27.301 --> 04:29.534
♪ to see
his dancing feets. ♪

04:31.604 --> 04:33.839
Oh.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.808
Ed, if you enjoyed
the choir so much,

04:36.810 --> 04:38.343
Why'd your wife
make you quit?

04:38.345 --> 04:40.479
She said it takes up
all my time.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.048
Really?
All your time?

04:43.050 --> 04:45.717
She says she hardly
ever sees me.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.886
- Even on the weekends?
- Especially on the weekends.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.555
This is perfect.

04:50.557 --> 04:53.392
That's okay.
I've already got
another hobby.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.961
I've been building
ships in a bottle.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.597
Slave ships in a bottle?

04:58.599 --> 05:00.732
No.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.870
Oh.

05:07.340 --> 05:11.043
Give it up, charlie.
I am not a men's choir
kind of guy.

05:11.045 --> 05:14.379
These are all guys
your age, dad.

05:14.381 --> 05:16.648
They're all
retired professionals
and they're funny.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.518
Who else would name themselves
the artificial hipsters?

05:19.520 --> 05:24.690
Besides, it would
take up a lot of the time
I normally spend with sam.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.391
All the more reason
to join the choir.

05:26.393 --> 05:29.061
Give sam a little
push out of the nest
like a baby bird.

05:29.063 --> 05:30.896
I know it's not
going to be easy.

05:30.898 --> 05:34.499
She was really looking
forward to that tour
of the oatmeal factory.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.669
Two tons of cinnamon
per day.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.973
Well, well.
Martin and charlie goodson.

05:41.975 --> 05:45.010
I can never remember
which is the father
and which is the son.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.612
Brett, you'd be
a good judge of this.

05:47.614 --> 05:50.082
Do you think guys
in singing groups
are losers?

05:50.084 --> 05:52.017
Hell, no.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.820
Charlie, every woman
knows a guy who can
keep a beat onstage

05:54.822 --> 05:57.956
Can keep a beat
in bed or a van

05:57.958 --> 06:00.792
Or the first aid station
at burning man.

06:01.794 --> 06:04.096
Let me see that flyer
again, charlie.

06:04.098 --> 06:05.931
You're gonna
love it, dad.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.900
And just how did you
wind up at burning man?

06:08.902 --> 06:11.837
Well, I took three ambien
at a fireworks show
in bakersfield

06:11.839 --> 06:15.874
And to this day
I have not been able
to connect the dots.

06:19.780 --> 06:23.949
I don't want to bust in
on your dad's choir practice.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.852
I know.
If they saw you in
that outfit, they'd die.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.488
Of course, if they
miss the damn baby
aspirin, they'd die.

06:30.823 --> 06:33.024
So why didn't they
just rehearse at
your dad's place?

06:33.026 --> 06:35.927
His apartment's tiny,
so I told him as long
as he keeps the place neat...

06:35.929 --> 06:38.964
Oh, well, I was
hoping we could make
it a little dirtier.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.668
- Oh, my god.
- Damn right.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.137
And that's just one hand.

06:45.139 --> 06:47.939
No, charlie, look.

06:51.811 --> 06:53.445
I'm gonna kill him.

06:53.447 --> 06:54.880
He might
be dead already.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.915
( snores )

06:57.884 --> 07:00.685
Oh, good.
I'm gonna kill him.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.688
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

07:06.859 --> 07:08.560
I'd dip his hand
in warm water,

07:08.562 --> 07:10.729
But that's my couch.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.665
Oh, just let him sleep.
He looks so peaceful.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.536
That's what makes this
so much fun.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.504
- Dad!
- Oh!

07:21.207 --> 07:23.008
Oh.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.143
Oh, hey, guys.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.845
How's it going?

07:26.847 --> 07:28.447
What the hell
happened here?

07:28.449 --> 07:32.617
I guess the choir practice
got a little out of hand.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.654
A little?
How much drinking went on?

07:35.656 --> 07:37.556
I don't know.
It doesn't take much.

07:37.558 --> 07:41.493
They're all on
prescription meds.

07:41.495 --> 07:44.863
Ooh, looks like somebody
had a lady over.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.799
Ooh, yes, that would be sal.
He's got a hernia.

07:50.536 --> 07:53.505
You know, at your age,
I thought I could trust you
to be responsible.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.607
Oh, I was just trying
to be one of the guys.

07:55.609 --> 07:58.143
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.079
You're right,
it won't happen again

08:01.081 --> 08:03.615
Because your friends
are never allowed back here.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.552
Were you guys smoking pot?

08:07.554 --> 08:10.689
That was morten.
He's got glaucoma.

08:10.691 --> 08:11.890
Uh-huh.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.059
What about sal?

08:14.061 --> 08:15.994
He's got anxiety.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.696
What about you?

08:17.698 --> 08:20.131
I thought about
having anxiety,

08:20.133 --> 08:22.667
But then I chickened out.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.174
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.909
I'm worried
about my dad, jen.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.811
I think he might
have fallen in with
the wrong crowd.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.613
Cut him some slack.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.748
You know, he's not
bothering sam anymore.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.283
He's making friends.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.085
And you know
how stubborn he is.

08:40.087 --> 08:43.054
If you come down too hard
on him, he's gonna
end up rebelling.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.056
Yeah, you're right.
Maybe I'm overreacting.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.659
But I do kind of want
to be the cool son

08:47.661 --> 08:49.594
That "gets it," you know?

08:49.596 --> 08:52.097
( phone rings )

08:53.266 --> 08:55.200
Hello?

08:55.202 --> 08:59.137
Charlie, it's your daddy.
You need to come pick him up.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.206
He and the rest
of the gray men's choir

09:01.208 --> 09:03.808
Are chasing away
all my customers
with their singing.

09:03.810 --> 09:07.145
Apparently they like to go
swimming with bowlegged women.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.215
Sea shanties?
Are they drunk?

09:10.217 --> 09:13.552
They might be
a bit overserved.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.287
Well, that's because
you overserved them.

09:15.289 --> 09:17.088
Don't worry, I took
your daddy's car keys

09:17.090 --> 09:20.258
And I put them where
I put all drunks' keys.
They're in my bra.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.893
Okay, I'll be right down.

09:21.895 --> 09:26.598
And every time I circle
the bar, I sound like
a team of reindeer.

09:28.167 --> 09:29.634
Hope you're happy, jen.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.803
My dad's friends got him
kicked out of a bar.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.339
Is there anything
I can do to help?

09:34.341 --> 09:36.141
Yeah, you can
go down there

09:36.143 --> 09:38.343
And drag my stupid,
drunken dad home.

09:47.153 --> 09:50.121
I'd love to, charlie,
but I'm in no condition
to drive.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.965
<i>( turns on radio,</i>
<i>music playing )</i>

10:03.302 --> 10:05.337
<i>( turns radio off )</i>

10:07.106 --> 10:09.374
I can't even listen
to my music?

10:09.376 --> 10:12.243
That's not music.
That's noise.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.246
Do you think I like
coming to get you in
the middle of the night?

10:15.248 --> 10:17.282
Fine, then don't do it.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.189
You really embarrassed me
in front of the guys.

10:24.191 --> 10:27.192
You're drunk
and I embarrassed you?

10:27.194 --> 10:29.027
They were playing quarters

10:29.029 --> 10:31.630
And stan said
if I didn't play,

10:31.632 --> 10:33.832
There weren't enough
guys for a game.

10:33.834 --> 10:37.268
If stan told you
to jump off a bridge,
would you do it?

10:37.270 --> 10:39.270
Yes.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.940
He was
a structural engineer.

10:43.776 --> 10:46.211
If he tells me to jump,
I have to assume

10:46.213 --> 10:49.681
There's something wrong
with the bridge's integrity.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.985
Well, I guess you have
an answer for everything.

10:55.755 --> 10:58.857
Dad, I understand
peer pressure,

10:58.859 --> 11:00.692
But you're not
a kid anymore.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.794
You can't run
around like one.
You understand?

11:02.796 --> 11:05.230
Whatever.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.132
Jerk.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.401
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.772
All right, gonzalo
just walked in.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.241
Now, remember,
you're my assistant, okay?

11:16.243 --> 11:18.910
Yeah, no, look at me.
I'm obviously your manager.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.346
Yeah, no,
you're my assistant.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.948
- Uh, yeah, no.
- Uh, yeah, no.

11:25.451 --> 11:28.787
Hi. You must be
mr. Rosenblatt.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.289
I'm patrick.
This is lacey,
my assistant.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.024
Manager.
So nice to meet you.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.126
Well, it's good to meet
the both of--

11:35.128 --> 11:36.895
Hang on.
Don't I know you?

11:36.897 --> 11:38.897
Oh, no.
I have a familiar face.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.299
- Shall we start with jackets?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.901
From riverside high.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.936
Remember
the homecoming game?

11:44.938 --> 11:47.072
We rolled you down
the bleachers in a trash can

11:47.074 --> 11:50.075
And you spilled out
at the 50-yard line in front
of the whole school.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.409
Nah, it doesn't
ring a bell.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.278
It's 50% silk,
so it lays beautifully.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.147
We called you... Patty.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.216
( laughs )
you know why?

11:58.218 --> 12:00.118
Yeah, duh,
'cause he's gay.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.854
What? No, 'cause he's
a pasty irish guy.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.856
Pat. Man.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.292
If I knew you were gay,
we would have called you...

12:07.294 --> 12:10.195
Yeah, probably patty.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.063
All right, it's me.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.500
And now I'm your
personal stylist,
so what can I do for you?

12:15.502 --> 12:17.268
I need to get
a couple of suits.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.772
I've got some meetings with
jp morgan and goldman sachs.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.274
So you must be what
they call in business

12:23.276 --> 12:25.210
A businessman.

12:25.212 --> 12:27.879
Yeah, I trade derivatives,
mostly currency swaps

12:27.881 --> 12:29.347
For institutional clients,

12:29.349 --> 12:32.150
And I do a little merger
arbitrage on the side.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.351
Do you work out?

12:33.353 --> 12:36.354
P90x every day.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.856
You got a boyfriend?

12:37.858 --> 12:39.424
I mean, I know
it ain't this guy.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.761
- ( laughs )
- right?

12:42.763 --> 12:45.797
Anyway, maybe we'll go
out for drinks tonight?

12:45.799 --> 12:47.365
Uh, yeah, we will.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.234
Just for size,
let's try these on.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.369
Okay.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.304
You put your digits
in here.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.340
I'll be right back.

12:57.243 --> 12:59.410
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be
helping me,

12:59.412 --> 13:01.346
Not get a date
to the douchebag ball.

13:01.348 --> 13:04.516
I'm just gonna make a date
with him and then not show up.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.951
- It'll be awesome.
- Really?

13:06.953 --> 13:08.520
You would do that for me?

13:08.522 --> 13:11.289
Dude, I'm totally
gonna blue-ball the guy.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.391
When I get done with him,
he won't be able to walk.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.393
Oh, my god, lacey.

13:15.395 --> 13:18.797
You are the most evil bitch
I've met in my entire life.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.132
Thank you.

13:22.401 --> 13:24.335
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

13:27.406 --> 13:29.240
Hi. Can I help you?

13:29.242 --> 13:32.177
This is a little awkward.
Are you charlie goodson?

13:32.179 --> 13:35.346
Well, you're both too old
to be my children,
so, yes, I am.

13:37.049 --> 13:38.983
I'm karen, this is bob.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.352
Bob's father stan is in
your dad's choir group

13:41.354 --> 13:42.887
And so is my father sal.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.355
Ah, with the girdle.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.391
Sure.
Come on in.

13:50.462 --> 13:53.531
So, what's going on?

13:53.533 --> 13:55.233
It's about your dad,
charlie.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.602
I'm afraid he's a bad
influence on our fathers.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.171
Look, I don't know
what your parents
are telling you,

14:00.173 --> 14:03.441
But my dad says that
your dads are the ones
starting all the trouble.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.078
Yeah, well, of course
he's gonna tell you that.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.413
He's scared
you'll get mad at him.

14:08.415 --> 14:11.115
My dad is not a ringleader.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.551
He just wants their approval
'cause he thinks they're cool.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.587
Let me tell you
what's not cool--

14:15.589 --> 14:17.388
Assuming, blaming.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.957
'cause you know what
happens when you blame?

14:18.959 --> 14:22.560
You... Be lame.

14:22.562 --> 14:26.865
Listen, one of these
nights, one of our dads
is gonna drink too much

14:26.867 --> 14:28.499
And he's gonna wind up
dead behind the wheel.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.202
And when that happens,
we're holding you responsible.

14:32.938 --> 14:35.940
Well, then I'll see you
at your dads' funerals.

14:35.942 --> 14:38.042
I know that sounds
like a threat, but it's not.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.245
It is a common courtesy
since I assume

14:40.247 --> 14:42.881
That your family will be
at my dad's as well.

14:51.991 --> 14:53.458
Hey, charlie.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.629
Got your message.
You wanted to see me?

14:57.631 --> 14:59.330
Have a seat, dad.

15:02.034 --> 15:04.235
So what's going on?

15:09.275 --> 15:13.177
Just had a visit
from a bob and a karen.

15:13.179 --> 15:16.180
Their fathers are in
your choir group.

15:16.182 --> 15:17.649
You know what
they told me?

15:17.651 --> 15:21.486
They told me that the real
troublemaker here is you.

15:21.488 --> 15:24.188
Get off my back.
It's none of your beeswax.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.291
Oh, it is my beeswax.

15:26.293 --> 15:29.027
It is very much
my beeswax, dad.

15:29.995 --> 15:31.462
I am responsible for you.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.698
Oh, yeah?
You know, when we go
to louie's house,

15:33.700 --> 15:36.467
His son buys us beer
and he's cool about it.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.970
Well, I'm not louie's son

15:38.972 --> 15:42.006
And I don't care
what louie's son lets
his father do.

15:42.008 --> 15:44.142
- ( phone chimes )
- oh.

15:44.144 --> 15:48.012
Will you get off
your damn cell phone
while I'm talking to you?

15:48.014 --> 15:49.347
It's stan.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.150
He wants me
to meet his sister
at p.F. Chang's.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.953
Jeez, if she looks
anything like stan...

15:54.955 --> 15:56.554
I wonder what
louie's up to.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.089
( sighs )

15:58.091 --> 15:59.958
You're not going
anywhere, mister,

15:59.960 --> 16:01.726
Until we're done
talking.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.728
Oh, yeah?
How you gonna stop me?

16:03.730 --> 16:05.129
I'm gonna take away
your car keys.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.031
I'd like to see you try.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.703
What else would you
like to see?

16:11.705 --> 16:13.972
Now don't be a smart-ass.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.740
I can still take you.
Now give me the keys.

16:15.742 --> 16:19.210
It wouldn't kill you
to not go out every
once in a while.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.679
Okay, fine.
Have it your way.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.748
I'm taking a nap.

16:23.750 --> 16:28.019
Unless sleeping in this house
is against the law, too.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.557
When does it get easier?

16:34.760 --> 16:37.261
Hey, patty.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.297
Gonzalo, hi.
How was your date
with lacey?

16:39.299 --> 16:41.299
Wait till you hear this.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.734
Oh, no, she stood you up?
That whore.

16:42.736 --> 16:45.136
What? No.

16:45.138 --> 16:48.506
One drink, we went back
to my place and got busy.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.708
What?
That whore.

16:52.411 --> 16:54.779
- Hey, is she here?
- No, she's not.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.149
But I plan on seeing her
very, very shortly.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.752
Awesome. Tell her
little gonzalo says hi.

17:00.754 --> 17:02.286
She'll know
what that means.

17:02.288 --> 17:03.788
I'm sure she will.

17:03.790 --> 17:07.125
- Little gonzalo is--
- is your penis. I got it.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.165
You had sex with him?

17:14.167 --> 17:16.501
Yeah, it was awesome.
You owe me.

17:16.503 --> 17:19.270
I owe you for having
awesome sex

17:19.272 --> 17:24.042
Hey, having crazy sex
with him was just part
of a bigger plan.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.711
I totally have
your back, okay?

17:26.713 --> 17:29.480
Actually, I think
gonzalo had your back.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.682
I'm just guessing.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.584
Okay, here's the plan.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.120
I keep going out with him,
get him totally hooked on me.

17:36.122 --> 17:37.722
And then in,
like, 10 years

17:37.724 --> 17:39.724
When we have a boy
and a girl and an escalade,

17:39.726 --> 17:41.759
I'll totally leave him
and take all his money.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.630
You know what?
You deserve each other.

17:45.632 --> 17:49.233
You're both selfish,
insensitive narcissists.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.468
I'm sorry,
what were you saying?

17:50.470 --> 17:55.173
I should have known better
than to think I could
count on you.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.475
Hey, patrick.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.644
What?

17:59.646 --> 18:01.345
If it makes you
feel any better,

18:01.347 --> 18:04.348
He's got some
ugly-ass feet.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.185
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.754
His big toe looks like
a baby bird's head.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.090
I'll take it.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.597
Nobody tells you how
to parent your parents.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.566
Yeah, it's tough, man.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.535
It's a very difficult age.

18:24.537 --> 18:29.107
They've got no jobs.
They can get pills from
all their friends.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.809
You can't trust them.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.511
Ever since
my parents retired,

18:33.513 --> 18:36.747
All they seem to want to do
is gamble my money away.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.149
Stop giving them money.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.817
Oh, it's still their money.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.519
It's just that
once they're dead,
it was gonna be mine.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.857
<i>( car engine starts )</i>

18:49.128 --> 18:50.895
Where's your dad now?

18:50.897 --> 18:53.264
In the other room
watching "judge judy."

18:53.266 --> 18:56.901
Well, in that case,
the ghost of jack kennedy
is stealing your car.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.538
You're kidding me.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.710
That's it.
I'm calling the cops.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.279
You'd actually send
your dad to jail, charlie?

19:08.281 --> 19:10.381
Hey, he likes oatmeal
and the toilet's right
next to the bed.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.450
He'll love it.

19:14.853 --> 19:16.787
Still not picking up
his phone.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.190
Will you relax, jen?
You're starting to make
me nervous.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.858
No, I can't relax,
not when your father

19:20.860 --> 19:22.560
Is out there
doing god knows what.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.695
Oh, so when he misbehaves,
he's my father?

19:24.697 --> 19:26.764
Yes, charlie.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.233
Because he's your father.

19:29.235 --> 19:32.270
Oh, sure, throw that
in my face.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.472
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

19:38.645 --> 19:43.381
This gentleman
was driving a car
that you reported stolen.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.850
And he was at
the airport doing five

19:45.852 --> 19:47.752
In a 15-mile-an-hour zone.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.488
Well, at least he's safe.

19:53.492 --> 19:55.760
Could you just tase him
once before you go?

19:57.196 --> 19:59.864
Thank you so much
for bringing him
home, officer.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.599
Well, I should get going.

20:03.702 --> 20:07.371
Oh, my gosh,
I think I parked
in front of a hydrant.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.440
There's no hydrant.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.442
I'm going.

20:17.249 --> 20:20.284
Dad, what the hell were
you doing at the airport
driving my car?

20:20.286 --> 20:21.752
I don't know.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.921
You do know.
You drove there.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.356
I don't want
to talk about it.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.591
You wouldn't
understand anyway.

20:26.593 --> 20:29.760
Try me.

20:29.762 --> 20:33.397
I was gonna fly
back to cincinnati
and see corinne.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.000
I got the divorce
papers, okay?

20:36.002 --> 20:37.835
She wants to finalize it.

20:37.837 --> 20:41.472
Yeah, I'm sorry, dad.
That sucks.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.274
It's bad enough
that I'm all alone.

20:43.276 --> 20:46.911
Now I get these damn papers
and I lose my mind completely.

20:46.913 --> 20:50.014
So, that explains
all the drinking.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.749
Yeah, that,

20:51.751 --> 20:53.951
And I love drinking.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.922
Now I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.458
Come on, dad.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.792
You're still a young guy.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.328
- No, I'm not.
- No, you're not.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.430
But you're certainly a catch.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.565
No, I'm not.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.567
No, you're not.

21:10.402 --> 21:11.769
Hey, you still got
your health.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.504
I do.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.706
Maybe I'll live
a long time.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.009
Yeah, that would be great.
