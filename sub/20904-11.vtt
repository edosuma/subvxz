18:34.706 --> 18:35.974
<b>- April.</b>

18:36.041 --> 18:37.576
<b> <i>- Your rider</i> </b>
<b> <i>looks super tough.</i> </b>

18:37.642 --> 18:39.578
<b> <i>And then the skull in there,</i> </b>
<b> <i>you shade it nicely.</i> </b>

18:39.644 --> 18:41.646
<b>It's soft.</b>
<b>It's not overdone.</b>

18:41.713 --> 18:43.281
<b>- But it's</b>
<b>a little bit weird.</b>

18:43.315 --> 18:45.751
<b> <i>The whole head of the horse</i> </b>
<b> <i>is just fleshless,</i> </b>

18:45.817 --> 18:48.353
<b> <i>and then it instantly just</i> </b>
<b> <i>turns into a regular horse.</i> </b>

18:48.420 --> 18:51.857

<b>ends is one of the messier ones.</b>

18:51.923 --> 18:54.059

<b> <i>of how your backgrounds</i> </b>
<b> <i>are gonna work together.</i> </b>

19:04.169 --> 19:06.171

<b>their own approach on it.</b>

19:06.304 --> 19:08.573
<b>- We didn't want them to--</b>

19:08.640 --> 19:10.475
<b>- Understood, but if there</b>

19:10.542 --> 19:11.643

<b>artist did them--</b>

19:11.710 --> 19:12.944

<b>- Yeah, I think</b>
<b>they all go together.</b>

19:14.413 --> 19:15.614

<b>of your back tattooed</b>

19:15.680 --> 19:16.982
<b>that look like</b>
<b>the same artist did it,</b>

19:17.048 --> 19:18.550

19:18.617 --> 19:19.851

19:19.918 --> 19:21.219
<b>That's the way every tattoo</b>

19:21.319 --> 19:22.754
<b>the whole time</b>

19:22.821 --> 19:24.189

<b>and just slapped it</b>
<b>on all of them.</b>

19:25.590 --> 19:26.958

19:27.025 --> 19:28.994
<b>when it's adaptability,</b>
<b>just to throw that away</b>

19:29.060 --> 19:30.295

19:30.362 --> 19:32.030

19:32.097 --> 19:34.366

37:13.201 --> 37:16.171
