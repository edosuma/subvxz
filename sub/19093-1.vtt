What are you doing here, Gwen?

I wanted to tell you.

What?

What could you possibly
have to say to me?

I've been trying to tell you!

I said no.

But I saw him put a ring
on your finger.

I don't know.

I couldn't stick around
to watch it.

I'd stuck around to watch that.

When I finally realized

01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:23.570
that planning my whole life out
didn't make me any happier.

when I was with Alex,

we were putting on a show.

When I saw
Alex propose to you...

for my future was over.

we have a chance...

it took so long to realize it.
