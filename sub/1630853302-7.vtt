00:10.125 --> 00:12.541
- Ruchel?

00:17.375 --> 00:19.625
Ir hot mikh gefunen.

00:22.250 --> 00:24.666
You found me.

00:31.708 --> 00:34.250
Why have you been
behind this door?

00:34.291 --> 00:36.000
I was left here.

00:36.041 --> 00:38.166
By who?

00:38.250 --> 00:39.583
By me.

00:39.666 --> 00:42.291
What do you mean?
Wh-What happened?

00:42.375 --> 00:44.416
I'm not so sure anymore.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.916
Where are we?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.416
- Home.
- Can you show us?

00:48.500 --> 00:51.500
We want to understand.
We want to help.

00:51.583 --> 00:55.000
Come on. You'll be safe with us.

01:05.375 --> 01:06.875
This is where I grew up.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.916
If you didn't see who did it,
we can't help you.

01:18.083 --> 01:19.875
Ruchel, what goes there?

01:20.916 --> 01:22.208
Oh, that's my house.

01:27.625 --> 01:28.791
Hello, can I help you?

01:28.875 --> 01:30.916
You're Zusman Talmon.

01:31.000 --> 01:31.958
Yes.

01:32.041 --> 01:34.625
I need to see your wife.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.708
Why is he going inside?

01:39.791 --> 01:42.083
He wanted Mama to see for him.

01:43.125 --> 01:44.666
Can you show us?

01:44.750 --> 01:46.583
Sure.

01:49.958 --> 01:51.416
Leeba.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.750
There's an officer here.

01:53.666 --> 01:54.708
Is there a problem?

01:54.791 --> 01:56.666
I heard you're a soothsayer.

01:57.666 --> 01:59.333
You can tell the future.

01:59.416 --> 02:01.083
No.

02:01.166 --> 02:02.208
Not exactly.

02:02.291 --> 02:03.666
I know you can.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.500
And I need to know something.

02:07.375 --> 02:08.916
I will pay you.

02:12.916 --> 02:14.458
What do you think, darling?

02:15.291 --> 02:16.833
Can you help this man?

02:16.916 --> 02:18.375
You help people, right?

02:19.083 --> 02:22.125
Friends and family,
and never for money.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.875
Well, make an exception.

02:41.916 --> 02:45.708
Mama had a gift.
I was learning from her.

02:50.833 --> 02:52.208
What is it you want to know?

02:52.291 --> 02:54.583
There's a woman.
I want her to be my wife...

02:55.916 --> 02:57.000
What will she say?

03:00.166 --> 03:02.083
I never knew my grandmother
was a mystic.

03:02.166 --> 03:04.083
What was she doing
with the bowl?

03:04.166 --> 03:06.375
She's using it
to focus power.

03:06.458 --> 03:09.875
You know, many ancient cultures
used reflecting pools

03:09.958 --> 03:12.041
as portals to higher planes.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.875
I am not getting
a clear reading.

03:15.958 --> 03:16.875
But I'm sure this woman
loves you.

03:16.958 --> 03:17.875
How could she not?

03:17.958 --> 03:19.083
Try again.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.875
It is clear, Mama.

03:20.958 --> 03:22.041
She will deny him.

03:22.125 --> 03:24.625
I know, but he cannot hear this.

03:24.708 --> 03:25.750
He will blame us.

03:25.833 --> 03:27.541
What did she say?

03:27.625 --> 03:28.625
What are you saying?

03:28.708 --> 03:30.250
Speak in Polish,
not your Jew-tongue.

03:30.333 --> 03:31.333
Apologies.

03:31.416 --> 03:32.500
My daughter was confused.

03:33.041 --> 03:35.208
I'm sorry we cannot help you.

03:40.500 --> 03:41.958
What a waste.

03:52.708 --> 03:53.875
But why?

03:53.958 --> 03:55.166
Why must we burn them?

03:55.250 --> 03:58.041
They can arrest us
just for owning such things.

03:58.125 --> 03:59.708
Even our rabbi
is opposed to this.

03:59.791 --> 04:01.666
Our emigration papers
will be ready soon.

04:01.750 --> 04:03.208
Then we'll be able to leave.

04:03.291 --> 04:04.458
Where are we going?

04:07.125 --> 04:08.708
We love our home.

04:08.791 --> 04:11.458
But there is a dangerous
feeling rising.

04:11.541 --> 04:14.416
We must be careful
as we plan our way out.

04:38.541 --> 04:39.791
Come and see.

04:45.708 --> 04:46.625
Mama!

04:46.708 --> 04:48.125
Papa!

04:48.208 --> 04:49.208
Mama...

04:52.166 --> 04:53.541
Damn it.

04:54.791 --> 04:56.125
If we don't
destroy these things,

04:56.208 --> 04:57.375
we will be the ones destroyed.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.375
Now go to the shed
and fetch the broom.

05:02.958 --> 05:03.958
Go on.

05:11.333 --> 05:14.333
What happened in there?
What did you see?

05:19.708 --> 05:22.458
I can't remember,
but what happens next

05:22.541 --> 05:25.708
is lost in there.

05:29.458 --> 05:32.083
You have no idea
what belongs there?

05:32.166 --> 05:34.250
No. But the Geraldines
live there.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.250
The Geraldines?

05:36.333 --> 05:39.000
Yeah. She's me.

05:39.083 --> 05:40.958
All of them.

05:49.500 --> 05:52.375
The other part of her collage.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.625
That's
everything.

05:54.708 --> 05:57.041
The house on Greene Road.

05:57.125 --> 05:58.833
And that's the boarding house
where she first lived

05:58.916 --> 06:00.208
in San Antonio.

06:00.291 --> 06:02.791
- Her giving birth.

06:02.875 --> 06:04.541
It's all there.

06:05.958 --> 06:08.375
It's all
so real.

06:08.458 --> 06:11.000
So real but so far away.

06:11.083 --> 06:15.291
She's keeping her childhood
deep in her subconscious.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.166
Something she doesn't want
to access about this village.

06:18.250 --> 06:21.333
There's some traumatic memory
lost in the blankness.

06:21.416 --> 06:23.708
Right. I was right.

06:23.791 --> 06:27.083
Whatever belongs in that blank
space is what haunted her.

06:27.166 --> 06:30.000
The reason she told Mom
not to adopt Alejandro.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.625
We fix this, we fix everything.

06:32.708 --> 06:35.708
- It's possible.
- We have to get to those
other versions of you.

06:35.791 --> 06:37.083
We have
to help them remember

06:37.166 --> 06:39.333
- what they want to forget.
- What is it?

06:39.416 --> 06:41.083
Ruchel, what is it?
What's wrong?

06:41.166 --> 06:43.083
I don't want to go in there.

06:44.791 --> 06:48.083
Every time I go, I call
for them. They don't care.

06:48.166 --> 06:51.000
They don't understand
I'm lonely here.

06:51.083 --> 06:53.916
Okay. Well, Ruchel,
we're here with you now, okay?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.583
We'll take care of you.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.750
Can you show us
how to get there?

06:57.833 --> 07:00.625
Okay.

07:17.291 --> 07:18.916
Hello there.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.083
Do you need help
finding your family?

07:21.166 --> 07:23.666
Oh, um...

07:23.750 --> 07:25.125
Mishpokhe?

07:25.208 --> 07:28.333
Ah, mishpokhe.

07:28.416 --> 07:30.750
No. No mishpokhe.

07:32.083 --> 07:35.416
Uh... Evelyn.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.791
You? Who are you?

07:44.333 --> 07:47.041
- Geraldine.
- Come on.

07:47.125 --> 07:50.583
Geraldine.

07:50.666 --> 07:52.541
I knew
she changed her name,

07:52.625 --> 07:54.250
but I still don't
understand why.

07:54.333 --> 07:55.666
What happened to her parents?

07:55.750 --> 07:58.583
- I don't know.
- Whatever
this trauma was,

07:58.666 --> 08:01.250
it forced her
to change everything.

08:01.333 --> 08:02.500
We need to find a moment
where she's open

08:02.583 --> 08:04.083
to tell us what happened.

08:04.166 --> 08:07.583
Just one moment
in her entire life, but...

08:11.833 --> 08:13.375
That's a lot of life.

08:22.083 --> 08:24.166
Whoa! Jesus Christ.

08:27.125 --> 08:28.916
We got to be careful in here.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.541
Yeah. Look, there she is
on her wedding day.

08:31.625 --> 08:33.666
Let's just try there.

08:33.750 --> 08:35.291
Okay, we'll just ask her
what happened after your dad

08:35.375 --> 08:37.875
- broke the reflecting bowl.
- Okay.

08:50.375 --> 08:52.083
Mom, we need
to ask you something.

08:54.041 --> 08:57.083
No. Not today.

09:03.541 --> 09:06.208
It's me. We're here to help.

09:06.291 --> 09:09.708
No, you're not. Go away.

09:11.583 --> 09:14.916
Mom, I need you to help us
understand what happened.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.333
What goes in here?

09:17.458 --> 09:19.333
Why would you bring her here?

09:28.208 --> 09:30.750
Hey, can you keep her
in the hallway a little while?

09:30.833 --> 09:32.791
We're not getting anywhere
once Geraldine sees her.

09:32.875 --> 09:34.875
- Okay.
- Dad, come on.

09:38.750 --> 09:40.541
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

09:52.416 --> 09:54.000
Mama, what are you singing?

09:55.458 --> 09:57.708
Something I heard in a dream.

09:59.083 --> 10:01.000
Oh, my God. We've seen this.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.833
Mama, we need your help.
Will you talk to us?

10:03.916 --> 10:05.250
No, no.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.541
I don't think so.
Not a good idea.

10:07.625 --> 10:10.666
Yeah, but we can fix everything.
Just-just talk to us.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.250
It's important.

10:12.333 --> 10:13.833
You have to tell us
what happened to you,

10:13.916 --> 10:15.458
why you abandoned Ruchel.

10:15.541 --> 10:17.333
I said no!

10:25.625 --> 10:28.166
It's okay, Dad.
We'll find a better moment.

10:29.708 --> 10:33.166
You ready to see the closest
I got to being Sandy Koufax?

10:33.250 --> 10:34.500
What?

10:36.583 --> 10:38.458
- Jacob?

10:38.541 --> 10:39.958
Step away from there,
it's dangerous.

10:40.041 --> 10:41.166
What are you doing?

10:41.250 --> 10:43.000
Look, when Dad
comes home, I'll tell him

10:43.083 --> 10:44.541
I was playing and broke the TV.

10:44.625 --> 10:46.583
'Cause if he doesn't
find out you broke it,

10:46.666 --> 10:48.000
you won't have to go away
again, right?

10:50.416 --> 10:52.583
You got a plan
for everything, huh?

10:54.500 --> 10:56.041
Jacob,

10:56.125 --> 11:00.416
I know I do things
that you don't understand,

11:00.500 --> 11:03.333
but just know that your mama
is always there deep down.

11:05.333 --> 11:08.625
I just, I just get
a little mixed up.

11:08.708 --> 11:12.500
So, how about I clean this up,

11:12.583 --> 11:16.000
and then we have
some ice cream?

11:16.083 --> 11:18.750
She really was
my whole world.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.250
I have an idea.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.125
Mama?

11:33.208 --> 11:35.583
Did something happen
when you were little?

11:35.666 --> 11:38.750
Something that made you
mixed up?

11:40.750 --> 11:42.291
No.

11:42.375 --> 11:46.833
No, my, my mama and papa
loved me very much.

11:46.916 --> 11:49.625
They loved me so much,
they bought me a ticket

11:49.708 --> 11:52.250
on a giant boat to America,

11:52.333 --> 11:54.791
where I've had
every opportunity.

11:56.125 --> 11:59.541
I am so very lucky.

11:59.625 --> 12:01.541
But what about
your mama and papa?

12:01.625 --> 12:03.583
Did they come later?

12:03.666 --> 12:05.208
They stayed.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.125
They stay with me in my heart.

12:07.208 --> 12:10.416
And that's where
I keep them today.

12:11.458 --> 12:13.250
This...

12:13.333 --> 12:15.416
it didn't happen like this.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.666
- What do you mean?
- That red coat,

12:17.750 --> 12:20.166
it was my mother's.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.833
Oh.

12:25.916 --> 12:28.375
Oh, no.

12:28.458 --> 12:29.958
I remember.

12:32.166 --> 12:33.750
Please, don't do this!

12:33.833 --> 12:35.208
You made her say no to me.

12:35.291 --> 12:37.125
You cursed me.

12:38.375 --> 12:39.291
Mama!

12:39.375 --> 12:40.375
Papa!

12:42.333 --> 12:43.708
Damn it.

12:44.958 --> 12:46.291
If we don't
destroy these things,

12:46.375 --> 12:47.833
we will be the ones destroyed.

12:47.916 --> 12:49.291
- I knew I wasn't
- Now go to the shed

12:49.375 --> 12:50.541
- supposed to see anymore.
- and fetch the broom.

12:50.583 --> 12:53.041
But I wanted to be
more like Mama.

12:53.125 --> 12:55.458
- Go on.
- I wanted to help people.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.958
There was a moment
that I thought my vision

13:08.041 --> 13:09.500
wouldn't come true.

13:17.041 --> 13:18.916
But it did.

13:26.541 --> 13:28.833
Please, don't do this!

13:28.916 --> 13:30.625
You made her say no to me.

13:30.708 --> 13:32.083
You cursed me.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.833
I didn't.
I promise, please.

13:33.916 --> 13:35.041
We destroyed everything.

13:35.125 --> 13:36.041
This is the end of it.

13:36.125 --> 13:37.833
Yes, this is the end.

13:37.916 --> 13:39.125
Where's your daughter?

13:39.208 --> 13:40.666
She's with a friend.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.791
No, please, no!

13:55.375 --> 13:57.791
I waited days
for them to return.

13:57.875 --> 14:00.583
But I knew they wouldn't.

14:06.375 --> 14:07.708
This is it. It's all my fault.

14:07.791 --> 14:09.916
They died because of me.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.166
- No, no.
Don't say that.
- I should have told them.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.916
I saw it all. We could have
all run and hid together.

14:26.375 --> 14:28.416
This is what she carried
her whole life.

14:31.083 --> 14:34.166
She blamed herself
for her parents' death.

14:37.791 --> 14:40.833
If you could tell your parents
one more time,

14:40.916 --> 14:42.666
do you think you could
change their mind?

14:42.750 --> 14:44.083
I don't know.

14:44.166 --> 14:46.666
You called us here
to help out.

14:46.750 --> 14:47.833
Right?

14:47.916 --> 14:49.416
Well, there you go.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.916
No reason to be afraid.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.750
What do you say
we give this another try?

14:52.833 --> 14:55.208
Okay.

14:58.083 --> 14:59.458
Damn it.

15:00.791 --> 15:01.958
If we don't
destroy these things,

15:02.041 --> 15:03.083
we will be the ones destroyed.

15:03.166 --> 15:04.250
Please, Papa!

15:04.333 --> 15:05.750
We have to run.

15:05.833 --> 15:07.000
We have to get out.

15:07.083 --> 15:08.166
The police are coming,

15:08.250 --> 15:09.166
and they're going
to take you away.

15:09.250 --> 15:10.166
They can't.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.666
We've done nothing.

15:11.750 --> 15:12.750
See?

15:13.916 --> 15:15.083
There's no evidence.

15:15.166 --> 15:16.958
No, listen, please!

15:17.041 --> 15:18.708
I know what will happen.

15:18.791 --> 15:20.708
Mama, please.

15:20.791 --> 15:22.375
Darling, I'm scared, too.

15:22.458 --> 15:23.625
But your father is right.

15:23.708 --> 15:25.125
We have our papers now.

15:25.208 --> 15:26.916
We'll leave
in only a few days more.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.458
If we run now,
we'll look guilty.

15:29.541 --> 15:31.541
But I know what will happen.
Please!

15:31.625 --> 15:33.250
Ruchel, go to the shed
and fetch the broom.

15:36.791 --> 15:39.708
I told you. I told you
they wouldn't listen,

15:39.791 --> 15:41.791
and now I let them down
all over again.

15:45.583 --> 15:47.541
I've got good news.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.875
We can try this again.

15:49.958 --> 15:52.625
And again.
Until we get it right.

15:54.958 --> 15:56.916
I can change their minds
for them.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.291
Again.

16:01.375 --> 16:03.500
You have to run,
you have to get out.

16:03.583 --> 16:04.708
If we don't
destroy these things,

16:04.791 --> 16:05.833
we will be the ones destroyed.

16:17.291 --> 16:18.583
Please, Papa.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.166
Enough. Get out. Now.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.416
Dad, my God,
are you okay?

16:27.500 --> 16:29.041
- Are you okay, Dad?
- Again.

16:29.083 --> 16:30.916
Please listen...

16:34.083 --> 16:35.333
Dad, let's talk
this through, okay?

16:35.416 --> 16:37.416
- No. Again.
- Oh, my God, Dad.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.208
Please, Papa.

16:45.416 --> 16:46.875
Please listen...

16:53.041 --> 16:54.833
Yes! We must listen to her.

16:55.791 --> 16:57.708
Now. Let's go hide in the shed.

16:57.791 --> 16:58.916
Quickly!

17:17.500 --> 17:19.583
No, no, no.

17:19.666 --> 17:21.458
Please. Please!

17:27.541 --> 17:29.458
- No.

17:35.708 --> 17:37.166
Okay, again.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.791
Dad, you have to slow down.

17:38.875 --> 17:40.333
No, they took her.
We have to fix this.

17:40.416 --> 17:42.166
Her reality is shifting.

17:42.250 --> 17:45.083
Who knows what could happen?
We have to go again.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.291
Damn it, Alma.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.291
Oh, my God,
he's gonna kill himself

17:49.375 --> 17:50.916
trying to change this.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
This is so much worse.
We should have never...

17:53.083 --> 17:55.208
No, no, no, no, no.
I have an idea.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.875
- Help him.
- How?

17:58.208 --> 18:00.583
- Use your instincts.
- Dad!

18:18.125 --> 18:19.708
I know you don't want to see me,
but Jacob's in trouble.

18:19.791 --> 18:22.125
- What do you mean?
- He's trying to save you,

18:22.208 --> 18:24.416
but he's destroying himself
in the process.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.416
He did always think
he could save me.

18:29.333 --> 18:32.125
You have to come with me.
Tell him to stop.

18:33.750 --> 18:36.583
Please, believe me.

18:36.666 --> 18:38.333
The way you wished
your parents had believed you.

18:38.416 --> 18:40.458
Please.

18:40.541 --> 18:43.250
You have to help your son.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.833
I love you. I don't want you
to hurt yourself.

18:48.916 --> 18:51.541
I need to do this.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.041
Great.

18:57.125 --> 18:58.875
Now look what you've done.

18:58.958 --> 19:01.500
Maybe we can't change this.
Maybe we shouldn't.

19:01.583 --> 19:04.208
If I could just control
one of them.

19:04.291 --> 19:06.500
- Dad, you have to stop.
- Dad, it's killing you.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.791
No. I've wasted enough chances.

19:08.875 --> 19:10.666
I'm willing to die
to take this one.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.083
- Finally do some good.
- Dad, that's not true.
Listen...

19:13.166 --> 19:14.375
Again.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.375
No. I can fix it.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.541
- I can.
- Jacob, you have to stop.

19:22.625 --> 19:25.625
No, Mama, I'm fixing it.
I'm fixing everything.

19:25.708 --> 19:28.041
Then you'll be better,
and everything can be better.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.000
You can't fix this, Jacob.

19:30.083 --> 19:32.083
No one can heal this.

19:39.250 --> 19:41.291
I'm sorry.

19:41.375 --> 19:42.791
Please don't leave me.

19:42.875 --> 19:44.916
God, I was so young.

19:51.750 --> 19:55.750
I know how sad
and angry you are.

19:55.833 --> 19:58.083
You just want
Mama and Papa back,

19:58.166 --> 20:01.583
but there was nothing you could
have done to save them.

20:02.625 --> 20:03.958
I wanted to.

20:05.833 --> 20:10.541
All they ever wanted was for you
to be safe, and you are.

20:12.041 --> 20:13.583
Somehow that was a gift

20:13.666 --> 20:16.333
that they were
still able to give you.

20:16.416 --> 20:21.541
And, look, now we have
a family of our own.

20:21.625 --> 20:27.416
An incredible, loving family
who would do anything for us.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.458
And you're part of it.

20:31.916 --> 20:34.750
- Really?
- Really.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.708
You're part of us.

21:00.916 --> 21:02.916
And we forgive you.

21:33.250 --> 21:36.541
My mother's life
was plagued by difficulty.

21:36.625 --> 21:41.083
But she found a way to love
and forgive herself and others.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.500
Who are you?

21:51.041 --> 21:52.500
Ruchel.

21:52.583 --> 21:54.833
And because of this,
for every hardship,

21:54.916 --> 21:57.000
she continued with resilience.

21:57.083 --> 22:00.208
From her emigration to a strange
new country on her own,

22:00.291 --> 22:03.000
to the life she built for me.

22:03.083 --> 22:07.625
Maybe that's why she said our
hardest work is also our best.

22:09.916 --> 22:12.583
Even, or especially,
when that work

22:12.666 --> 22:15.583
came from unexpected places.

22:20.333 --> 22:22.916
Sometimes it's hard
to conceive of all the good

22:23.000 --> 22:25.875
one person or one action can do.

22:29.708 --> 22:31.458
But all our lives are connected.

22:33.833 --> 22:37.125
And her life set those
connections on the right course.

22:42.625 --> 22:46.250
So tonight we light
this yahrzeit candle

22:46.333 --> 22:49.708
on the anniversary
of my mother's passing.

22:49.791 --> 22:53.416
It will burn for one day
to remind us

22:53.500 --> 22:56.541
of the spark of life
that Ruchel gave us all.
