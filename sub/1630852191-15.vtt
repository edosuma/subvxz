01:10.111 --> 01:12.530
Did you go somewhere this late at night?

01:17.827 --> 01:19.370
What is going on?

01:22.832 --> 01:25.335
What have you done to him?

01:27.545 --> 01:28.421
I comforted him.

01:29.380 --> 01:30.298
What?

01:30.924 --> 01:33.384
Mr. An seemed
to be having such a tough time

01:33.468 --> 01:36.012
to the point where
watching him suffer felt awful.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.309
Why did you do it?

01:41.392 --> 01:43.478
You two had a happy marriage

01:44.229 --> 01:45.647
and he really cherished you.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.608
What was the problem?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.485
Your mother-in-law?

01:51.402 --> 01:54.697
You said you could put up with her
as long as he was on your side

01:54.781 --> 01:56.574
no matter how scary she was.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.702
So why?

02:03.206 --> 02:04.541
Shut up and leave.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.961
You were the problem after all.
Your greed.

02:09.504 --> 02:12.132
You wanted to maintain
stability in your life

02:12.674 --> 02:14.968
and satisfy your desires at the same time.

02:15.677 --> 02:19.389
Had you been willing to risk everything,
I wouldn't have hated you as much.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.018
If you were going to steal him,
you should've kept him.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.479
Was he a toy you could toss away
once you were done?

02:29.149 --> 02:33.486
You must have been so happy
when you found out he'd lost his memories.

02:33.570 --> 02:37.031
Blame me for what I did to you.
Just stick to what concerns you!

02:38.324 --> 02:39.909
You don't get to blame me

02:39.993 --> 02:42.996
for what I did to Woo-jae.
That's his business.

02:43.955 --> 02:47.750
And everything between my husband and me,
that's none of your business, so butt out.

02:48.459 --> 02:51.796
Don't use someone else's pain
against them. Got it?

03:00.805 --> 03:03.099
Do you know why betrayal is so cruel?

03:05.435 --> 03:07.228
Because betrayal makes you

03:07.979 --> 03:10.648
endlessly doubt
the person you love the most.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.322
You ruined everyone.

03:19.198 --> 03:21.826
Me, Woo-jae,

03:23.244 --> 03:24.704
and even your husband.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.186
Honey--

04:36.192 --> 04:37.986
<i>He's a man, after all.</i>

04:38.069 --> 04:39.779
You don't think he can't cheat too?

04:58.423 --> 04:59.674
Damn it.

05:11.561 --> 05:16.649
EPISODE 15
BREAKUPS ARE HARDER THAN BEING IN LOVE

05:32.165 --> 05:33.291
Thanks.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.394
Do you remember?

05:55.271 --> 05:56.147
What?

05:57.315 --> 05:59.192
Who brought you home?

06:06.282 --> 06:07.116
Yes.

06:08.576 --> 06:09.786
What happened?

06:12.038 --> 06:14.582
Why did Gu Hae-won bring you home?

06:15.750 --> 06:16.751
Well…

06:20.088 --> 06:21.339
Hyeong-gi…

06:22.673 --> 06:23.925
I went to the building

06:25.426 --> 06:27.345
where Mr. Lee's accident took place.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.972
And I ran into Seo Woo-jae there.

06:32.850 --> 06:36.104
<i>You see, we still have lingering feelings.</i>

06:39.357 --> 06:42.235
I remember that look on your face.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.153
You looked just like this

06:44.654 --> 06:47.073
when you came to the pub looking for her.

06:47.740 --> 06:51.285
<i>You were worried that Hui-ju might come
back to me, but you pretended not to be</i>

06:52.203 --> 06:53.329
and that you were fine.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.500
I'm going to split it with Gu Hae-won.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.169
I'm willing to give up everything I have.

07:00.253 --> 07:04.590
Can you still say that
this is just infatuation and lust?

07:07.510 --> 07:09.262
You must be more worried than before

07:10.388 --> 07:11.597
because Hui-ju…

07:12.723 --> 07:15.893
doesn't need the stability
from you anymore.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.064
Who are you kidding?

07:22.733 --> 07:25.403
You knew that Hui-ju
would abandon you in the end.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.780
That's why you didn't end things with me.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.533
You were a selfish coward.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.785
Stop pretending you're some romantic.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.454
What's going on between you two?

07:34.537 --> 07:35.746
I'm not like you.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.583
I came here to see Mr. Lee.

07:39.208 --> 07:42.420
Where is he? He said he was
meeting you here the last time we talked.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.005
Mr. Lee is severely injured.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.050
-What happened?
-I heard it was an accident.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.473
It was an accident.

07:56.517 --> 07:57.894
And it must stay that way.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.702
<i>We can only find out what happened
if Mr. Lee gains consciousness.</i>

08:14.785 --> 08:16.787
<i>There are no security cameras
in that area.</i>

08:17.330 --> 08:20.750
<i>So for now, Seo Woo-jae's statement
as the witness is everything we have.</i>

08:22.502 --> 08:24.086
You don't believe him, do you?

08:27.298 --> 08:30.259
I doubt that Woo-jae hurt Mr. Lee.

08:31.802 --> 08:34.430
He has no reason
to turn down Mr. Lee's help.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.935
But seeing how he still won't talk…

08:39.018 --> 08:41.187
Hui-ju might have something to do with it.

08:42.396 --> 08:43.689
Is that your point?

08:47.527 --> 08:49.904
We'll know once Mr. Lee wakes up.

08:53.407 --> 08:54.408
I…

08:59.413 --> 09:02.124
I'm not sure if that's what I want…

09:05.753 --> 09:07.505
If I really want to find it out…

09:12.802 --> 09:14.011
I'm not sure.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.266
I don't know.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.310
They say forgiving someone

09:22.645 --> 09:24.689
is like letting go of a prisoner

09:25.398 --> 09:28.276
and then realizing
that the prisoner was actually yourself.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.070
But look at us.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.614
It looks like

09:34.949 --> 09:37.785
you and I are still locked up in prison.

09:41.289 --> 09:45.001
That means
you still haven't forgiven Hui-ju yet.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.385
<i>I was exhausted and desperate for a drink.</i>

10:04.937 --> 10:06.355
Is that all?

10:06.439 --> 10:07.732
Should there be more?

10:09.317 --> 10:11.360
But you didn't have to drink with--

10:11.444 --> 10:13.613
Don't assume
that I'd cheat because you did.

10:22.538 --> 10:23.539
Yes.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.631
His surgery is over.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.477
<i>His post-op condition
is better than expected.</i>

10:45.061 --> 10:47.647
As you all know,
Ms. An is an excellent surgeon.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.024
But it is possible that
he may have a disability

10:50.107 --> 10:51.776
due to the damaged nervous system.

10:51.859 --> 10:52.818
What disability?

10:52.902 --> 10:56.155
There's a loss of sensation and movement
on the right side of his body.

10:56.947 --> 11:00.076
As for his left leg,
some of the nerves are still working.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.119
So we'll see after physical therapy.

11:02.620 --> 11:06.332
But regaining his speech
is a more serious problem.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.595
He can't talk?

11:20.429 --> 11:22.348
What good will a mute lawyer be?

11:23.724 --> 11:25.768
I've finally taught him to be useful.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.062
What will you do?

11:30.272 --> 11:31.857
What do you mean?

11:32.650 --> 11:34.235
I'll help him recover as much--

11:34.318 --> 11:36.195
And look after him
for the rest of your life?

11:39.657 --> 11:40.699
Are you laughing?

11:43.077 --> 11:44.412
How can you laugh right now?

11:47.081 --> 11:52.169
I just remembered why I married him.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.258
He wasn't like you.

12:01.095 --> 12:05.850
But it turned out I was fooled
and tamed by his kind and sweet words

12:08.060 --> 12:10.855
Growing up, you were never nice to me.

12:10.938 --> 12:12.898
So I focused on my studies,

12:13.607 --> 12:16.068
thinking you'd compliment me
if I became a doctor.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.528
What are you talking about?

12:19.822 --> 12:21.574
Why are you bringing that up now?

12:22.158 --> 12:26.495
"You. I didn't give birth to you because
I wanted to, so don't get in my way."

12:28.456 --> 12:32.251
"How can you survive in this world
if you can't even befriend those losers?"

12:33.752 --> 12:35.045
"Aren't you on a diet?"

12:36.338 --> 12:37.965
"You're such a pig."

12:38.549 --> 12:40.050
"How can you even be eating after that?"

12:40.134 --> 12:41.051
Hey.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.930
When I said I didn't want
to marry the man you chose,

12:45.764 --> 12:47.183
what was it you said?

12:49.351 --> 12:50.978
"You'll come to your senses

12:51.061 --> 12:55.149
once you marry an awful man
who beats you for the rest of your life."

12:58.611 --> 12:59.904
Should I continue?

12:59.987 --> 13:03.282
Hey. Why do you still remember those--

13:03.365 --> 13:05.659
Don't "hey" me from now on.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.579
Because you treat me so badly, he also…

13:17.505 --> 13:18.547
I…

13:20.007 --> 13:21.467
forgot I even said those.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.553
She remembers them verbatim.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.768
I think it's been really hard for Min-seo.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.104
What?

13:35.981 --> 13:39.985
The person who was hurt
remembers things much more clearly.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.291
TAERIM HIGH SCHOOL OF ARTS

13:58.504 --> 14:01.549
Mr. Lee is in pretty bad shape.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.802
I need your help
with the foundation for now.

14:04.885 --> 14:05.886
Yes, sir.

14:06.470 --> 14:07.930
And regarding Mr. Seo…

14:08.973 --> 14:10.766
He's appearing in print ads.

14:10.849 --> 14:15.271
And he's accepting all the interviews
from the press and production studios.

14:15.354 --> 14:19.149
He'll also be walking on the runway
for a charity at Fashion Week.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.986
A documentary about his father
will be put together too.

14:22.945 --> 14:26.490
Was it Park Jae-gwan?
The critic we met before.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.201
Why don't we use him again?

14:29.910 --> 14:32.788
He can only critique his art,
not his personal life.

14:33.455 --> 14:37.001
It seems Ms. Lee of Hwain Gallery
has already talked to him.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.213
Ms. Lee is serious
about supporting Mr. Seo.

14:50.639 --> 14:52.308
I haven't seen this before.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.561
I'm trying out something new.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.105
Don't you think it's better

14:58.188 --> 15:00.774
to stick to your style
than to try something new for now?

15:00.858 --> 15:03.527
I'm sick of hearing
how my work resembles my father's.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.490
You're his son. What's wrong with that?

15:09.116 --> 15:12.077
Besides, your father was
definitely an artistic genius.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.538
But no one recognized him.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.916
Because he wasn't flexible like you.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.668
You're different. You will be successful.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.587
I guarantee it.

15:27.009 --> 15:31.722
Come to think of it,
Ms. Jeong knew you better than I did.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.727
At your exhibition, she said…

15:36.810 --> 15:39.521
But even if he wasn't
a good father to Mr. Seo,

15:39.605 --> 15:43.317
I'm sure he was the best father
to the artist within Mr. Seo.

15:44.818 --> 15:46.612
Not only did he pass down his talent,

15:47.196 --> 15:50.199
but also a sense of hunger
that couldn't be satiated.

15:51.575 --> 15:54.536
I'm sure Mr. Seo will prove his worth.

16:26.777 --> 16:30.447
Min-seo.
There's something I must tell you.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.619
Can we talk outside?

16:35.703 --> 16:36.787
Let's talk here.

16:37.788 --> 16:38.872
He can't…

16:40.582 --> 16:41.834
hear us anyway.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.426
What? What is it?

16:51.885 --> 16:53.679
When your husband had an accident,

16:54.888 --> 16:56.473
I was there with him.

17:04.940 --> 17:08.360
That flower comes up a lot
in a novel called <i>Wuthering Heights.</i>

17:08.444 --> 17:09.319
Give it a read.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.746
<i>WUTHERING HEIGHTS</i>

17:38.557 --> 17:39.933
Let me get this straight.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.854
He suspected you cheated,
so he called you there to threaten you,

17:43.937 --> 17:45.439
but he tragically fell?

17:46.732 --> 17:49.526
In other words, my husband is a bastard?

17:52.946 --> 17:56.658
Do you expect me to say that to people?

17:57.618 --> 18:00.454
I could've grabbed his hand
before he fell.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.420
What if you did?

18:11.465 --> 18:14.009
Both of you could have fallen
if you tried to save him.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.181
I can't be responsible for you too.

18:21.225 --> 18:24.061
He told me the building
needed a safety inspection

18:24.144 --> 18:25.604
which was bad for construction.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.359
As long as I'm concerned,
he fell when he went to check up on that.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.485
But…

18:32.486 --> 18:35.322
If that's all, leave.
I'm done listening to you now.

19:22.452 --> 19:25.289
What brings you here at this hour?

19:26.248 --> 19:29.334
I came out for some business,
so I stopped by to see you.

19:30.878 --> 19:34.256
-What business?
-I sold the fishing spot.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.300
Already?

19:36.383 --> 19:39.511
The association wanted to hold out
to raise the compensation.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.805
But it seemed unnecessary.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.768
This is for the better. I should sell it
when I can and get out of there.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.146
When?

19:49.855 --> 19:52.024
Cooking is already
prohibited there at night.

19:52.107 --> 19:55.569
I'll keep it open during the day
for my regulars and start wrapping it up.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.824
Do you think you can stay there
at night all by yourself?

20:00.908 --> 20:04.203
Didn't I tell you? People scare me more.

20:08.081 --> 20:10.125
By the way, what are you doing here?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.461
I wanted to see your kids
if you were at home.

20:19.593 --> 20:20.761
What is it?

20:23.555 --> 20:26.475
Why the long face?
What happened this time?

20:26.558 --> 20:28.101
Gosh. I don't know.

20:30.979 --> 20:33.899
I don't know
what's wrong with me these days.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.367
What is it?

20:44.993 --> 20:47.663
Why can't you ever catch a break?

20:54.086 --> 20:55.045
Thanks.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.220
Once I'm as old as him,

21:04.054 --> 21:06.765
do you think I can let go of everything
and live peacefully?

21:09.476 --> 21:11.144
Do you think he's living peacefully?

21:13.730 --> 21:16.692
His wife's dementia is pretty bad,
so she's in a nursing home.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.904
And his only daughter got a brain lesion
from a car accident as a kid,

21:21.613 --> 21:23.198
so he's been taking care of her.

21:25.951 --> 21:29.121
A caretaker comes
to bathe and look after her for two hours.

21:30.455 --> 21:33.375
For those two hours,
he dresses up and indulges himself here.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.876
The only luxury he has in life.

21:36.670 --> 21:40.173
He's still living because
he can't leave behind his daughter alone.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.510
This is his last place of rest.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.557
Getting old doesn't bring peace.

21:49.474 --> 21:51.643
You do whatever it takes
to find a way to cope.

21:52.728 --> 21:56.565
So if there are things
you can let go, you should do it now.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.319
If you push them to the cliff,

22:02.029 --> 22:03.530
you will fall with them.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.930
I couldn't stop thinking all day.

22:30.974 --> 22:33.060
Where you and Hae-won were yesterday

22:34.436 --> 22:35.812
and what you did

22:37.147 --> 22:38.440
and talked about together.

22:39.608 --> 22:40.650
Hui-ju.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.570
I told you it was nothing--

22:43.653 --> 22:46.364
I'm not saying I'm doubting you.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.825
That's what I did.

22:50.744 --> 22:53.330
So things must have been
really difficult for you.

22:54.748 --> 22:57.000
How could you have been okay?

23:02.839 --> 23:06.259
I wanted to turn a blind eye
when I knew you were suffering.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.848
I was being selfish. I'm sorry.

23:17.521 --> 23:21.650
I will withdraw
from the project with Hwain Gallery.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.861
My family means more to me than my career.

23:27.114 --> 23:30.033
I don't ever want to
make you feel insecure again.

23:33.787 --> 23:37.165
Just let me smooth things out
with the gallery.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.711
I don't want to
cause trouble for the project.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.756
I'd be grateful.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.890
Thank you for being patient.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.481
Go to bed first. I'll be in the studio.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.625
If you find what I have done so far

24:21.459 --> 24:23.336
helpful to the project,

24:24.004 --> 24:26.089
feel free to use my work

24:26.173 --> 24:27.799
without any conditions.

24:29.092 --> 24:31.511
May I ask why you want to drop out
all of a sudden?

24:31.595 --> 24:33.638
It wasn't sudden.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.308
I'm sure you sensed it too.

24:36.391 --> 24:38.059
But still. This isn't right.

24:38.143 --> 24:41.354
If this is about Ms. Gu, I already…

24:49.779 --> 24:53.825
<i>You don't love me. Wake up!</i>

24:53.909 --> 24:55.619
<i>Who are you to judge my feelings?</i>

24:56.203 --> 24:58.330
<i>This isn't love!</i>

24:58.914 --> 25:02.626
This is why I cannot continue
to work with him on this project.

25:02.709 --> 25:03.543
<i>Please stop!</i>

25:03.627 --> 25:05.754
-Giving up
<i>-This is wrong, Woo-jae!</i>

25:07.047 --> 25:11.218
being part of Mr. Woo's last masterpiece
was a huge decision for me.

25:15.305 --> 25:19.893
I don't want to involve the police
or make this public.

25:21.269 --> 25:24.147
As I've been
in the public eye more than him,

25:25.774 --> 25:27.901
a lot more people would criticize me.

25:29.778 --> 25:32.447
Is Mr. Seo aware of this?

25:32.530 --> 25:33.448
No.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.328
You're the only one
who watched this footage.

25:40.121 --> 25:42.582
What do you want me to do?

25:46.503 --> 25:48.797
I know very well how much you care

25:49.464 --> 25:53.051
about this project and how hard
you've been working for it.

25:54.511 --> 25:57.764
I don't want to ruin this project either.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.894
I'm indebted to Mr. Seo for something.

26:02.978 --> 26:05.772
So I will let this incident slide.

26:08.191 --> 26:12.737
But please make sure
he never does anything

26:12.821 --> 26:14.864
like this again in the future.

26:16.283 --> 26:20.036
Can you guarantee that
you will never bring this up again?

26:37.137 --> 26:37.971
Get in.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.682
Weren't you following me?

26:45.937 --> 26:49.149
Yes, ma'am. So are you saying Li-sa has--

26:49.232 --> 26:50.442
<i>The wounds.</i>

26:51.443 --> 26:54.571
<i>She has a lot of wounds on her thighs.
Did you know about them?</i>

26:59.576 --> 27:05.373
I know that she's gotten hurt often lately

27:05.915 --> 27:08.335
because she's careless and clumsy.

27:08.418 --> 27:09.377
<i>No.</i>

27:11.296 --> 27:14.799
I think they are self-inflicted wounds.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.762
<i>I think you should check up on her.</i>

27:21.097 --> 27:24.851
Then where's… Where is Li-sa now?

27:25.602 --> 27:28.646
<i>She called in sick and hasn't come
for a few days. Didn't you know?</i>

27:42.410 --> 27:44.204
DIVORCE AGREEMENT
HUSBAND: SEO WOO-JAE

27:44.287 --> 27:45.914
Are you divorcing Ms. Gu?

27:46.498 --> 27:48.958
Yes. Did you follow me
to find out about that?

27:50.877 --> 27:52.337
Why'd you tell me about that book?

27:54.381 --> 27:55.465
Did you even read it?

27:55.548 --> 27:58.510
It was very long and boring.
I didn't understand it at all.

27:58.593 --> 28:01.638
Love is hard to understand.

28:01.721 --> 28:04.599
That's not love.
They keep saying they're miserable.

28:05.975 --> 28:06.976
So you did read it.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.273
Two nights ago,

28:13.775 --> 28:15.235
you were at my house, right?

28:17.779 --> 28:19.197
You met my mom, didn't you?

28:20.949 --> 28:22.075
Why?

28:24.327 --> 28:27.455
Do you seriously not know?
Or are you trying to see if you're right?

28:30.708 --> 28:32.085
You read the book.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.755
You really don't know
why two people would meet?

28:45.640 --> 28:46.516
<i>Where are you?</i>

29:02.699 --> 29:04.075
Get in the car.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.702
-He--
-Stop talking. Get in.

29:17.213 --> 29:18.673
Why were you with Li-sa?

29:19.257 --> 29:20.633
What are you plotting?

29:20.717 --> 29:24.220
I never intended to meet her.
She came to me.

29:25.555 --> 29:27.056
Cut her some slack.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.976
It was something like a book club meeting.

29:30.059 --> 29:31.269
Why are you here?

29:32.353 --> 29:33.730
I moved here.

29:34.439 --> 29:37.025
I told you. I'm divorcing Hae-won.

29:37.108 --> 29:38.735
But why here of all places?

29:38.818 --> 29:42.197
The unit was available, and I want
to remember more of our good days.

29:43.907 --> 29:47.243
It's the same passcode.
Come anytime you want.

29:50.663 --> 29:55.001
The police couldn't find
Mr. Lee's cell phone.

29:55.084 --> 29:57.879
He said he needed to tell me
something about your husband.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.965
Did you take his cell phone?

30:02.050 --> 30:03.259
No.

30:03.343 --> 30:06.971
There might be something in the phone
that other people shouldn't see.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.515
I don't know where it is.

30:09.390 --> 30:10.600
And I don't want to.

30:26.115 --> 30:27.367
Gosh.

30:30.286 --> 30:31.621
Did you do this to yourself?

30:32.205 --> 30:34.332
Why? What's the problem?

30:34.415 --> 30:36.709
We give you everything
you want and ask for.

30:37.293 --> 30:39.337
You have everything.
Why are you doing this?

30:39.420 --> 30:40.672
It's all because of you!

30:42.006 --> 30:43.466
Everything that happened

30:43.550 --> 30:46.010
with Mimi, Ju-yeong,
and Ho-su is all your fault!

30:51.558 --> 30:52.475
I saw everything.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.352
I saw it that day.

30:54.435 --> 30:56.855
You left Dad and me there.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.691
And I saw you with that man!

31:00.358 --> 31:04.279
You didn't see anything. I told you.
You're mistaken. Why won't you believe--

31:04.362 --> 31:08.116
Yes! That's why I pretended
I didn't know anything about you two!

31:08.199 --> 31:10.869
Then you should be careful!
Why do you keep seeing him?

31:10.952 --> 31:13.329
What if Dad finds out?

31:17.125 --> 31:21.880
Do you like that man more than me or Dad?

31:25.174 --> 31:26.217
Li-sa.

31:49.407 --> 31:52.201
Please book me an appointment
with Dr. Jeong for next week.

31:52.285 --> 31:53.119
One moment.

31:58.124 --> 32:00.710
Dr. Jeong will be leaving
the hospital next week.

32:00.793 --> 32:03.087
I'll make you an appointment
with another doctor.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.302
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

32:09.802 --> 32:11.471
Are you running away?

32:12.138 --> 32:14.724
You didn't ask me for permission.
I didn't sign off on it.

32:14.807 --> 32:18.311
How dare you try to run away
from me behind my back?

32:19.103 --> 32:21.981
That's not true. Right?

32:22.065 --> 32:25.485
It's not, right?
Tell me it's not true! It can't be.

32:25.568 --> 32:26.778
Tell me you're staying!

32:27.278 --> 32:29.697
If you cared even a bit about Jeong-seop,
how could I…

32:29.781 --> 32:32.367
No. How could you leave?

32:33.034 --> 32:34.494
You can't run away

32:34.577 --> 32:37.622
to live your own life.
You just can't, you bastard.

32:37.705 --> 32:41.167
You bastard!

32:42.835 --> 32:43.795
Please stop.

32:43.878 --> 32:46.756
Why do you keep butting in?
You don't know anything.

32:47.590 --> 32:51.302
Do you know what he did to Jeong-seop? He…

32:53.179 --> 32:56.140
Yes. Your son

32:57.433 --> 32:59.352
was Dr. Jeong's friend.

32:59.435 --> 33:01.938
Yes. They were friends.

33:02.772 --> 33:06.401
They were friends. But why…

33:06.484 --> 33:10.613
Why did only my son die?
Why did only my Jeong-seop have to die?

33:12.865 --> 33:13.866
I'm sorry.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.785
How could you do this if you're sorry?

33:15.868 --> 33:17.745
Jeong-seop would think it's so unfair

33:17.829 --> 33:21.165
seeing you enjoying your life
when he's dead!

33:21.249 --> 33:22.458
You bastard.

33:24.877 --> 33:26.129
Is that how he would think?

33:26.838 --> 33:27.880
What?

33:28.381 --> 33:32.969
Do you think he would want his friend
to live a life of suffering forever?

33:35.388 --> 33:37.181
Was that the kind of person he was?

33:43.604 --> 33:44.814
Stop it.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.483
She's right.

33:49.527 --> 33:50.528
Ma'am.

34:39.285 --> 34:40.787
Did you send her off safely?

34:41.370 --> 34:42.413
Yes.

34:43.623 --> 34:47.043
But if this ever happens again,

34:47.877 --> 34:50.755
just let it go because
she has the right to do that.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.799
How do you endure it?

34:55.051 --> 34:56.344
I'm not enduring it,

34:57.428 --> 34:59.764
I'm just waiting
for her anger to die down.

35:00.515 --> 35:03.184
-For how long?
-I don't know.

35:04.852 --> 35:09.273
I can only imagine
how deep her pain must be.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.401
What was that about going to America?

35:15.321 --> 35:16.739
An internship.

35:17.782 --> 35:21.702
An opportunity to study more
on physical therapy came up,

35:23.955 --> 35:27.792
But I don't know if I should go.

35:29.001 --> 35:30.044
You should go.

35:32.213 --> 35:35.508
I also had an opportunity once,
but I lost it.

35:36.759 --> 35:41.139
I pitied myself for losing the chance
and regretted it a lot.

35:44.100 --> 35:47.436
So, don't regret it and go.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.611
You also…

35:57.238 --> 36:00.575
You also have regrets,
so you should start over.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.329
It's already too late for me.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.680
Mr. Lee's surgery went well.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.560
Once he regains consciousness,

36:28.477 --> 36:32.398
he will tell the police what happened.
Is that okay with you?

36:38.696 --> 36:40.406
Hui-ju was there that day too.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.369
Does that change anything?

36:47.788 --> 36:51.125
He fell because he wasn't careful.
That's a fact.

36:54.128 --> 36:55.755
I sent over the paper again.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.424
Let's end this quickly.
You'll be better off that way.

36:58.507 --> 36:59.759
Better?

37:01.260 --> 37:03.554
Who are you to judge what I want?

37:03.638 --> 37:05.389
Then what is it that you want?

37:06.807 --> 37:08.309
What do you gain from this?

37:10.353 --> 37:13.147
If you're holding onto me
out of fear and loneliness, stop.

37:13.981 --> 37:17.276
You always had a lot of people
who cared about you. And you still do.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.946
Don't act like I ruined your life.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.156
If you do, you're disrespecting them.

37:30.164 --> 37:31.540
If you don't let go of me,

37:32.583 --> 37:35.044
we will only keep
hurting each other like this.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.505
It's better to be lonely alone

37:38.422 --> 37:39.882
than be miserable together.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.557
Remember what I told you?

37:49.934 --> 37:51.477
For us, a divorce means

37:52.645 --> 37:54.272
either your death…

37:55.773 --> 37:57.566
or mine.

38:02.488 --> 38:03.948
Do you still want that?

38:39.859 --> 38:41.986
Ho-su and Li-sa are staying
with my mom today.

38:42.069 --> 38:43.696
What on earth happened?

38:45.948 --> 38:48.576
Li-sa didn't tell you anything?

38:48.659 --> 38:49.910
Tell me what?

38:49.994 --> 38:52.163
She stopped talking to me a long time ago.

38:59.128 --> 39:00.588
What's going on?

39:15.478 --> 39:17.772
Li-sa is harming herself.

39:18.773 --> 39:19.774
What do you mean?

39:19.857 --> 39:21.484
I had no idea.

39:23.611 --> 39:27.948
I'm her mother, but I was so blind.
I found out when her teacher told me.

39:32.119 --> 39:35.539
I knew that Li-sa was acting strange.

39:38.084 --> 39:41.295
But why didn't I
try harder to look into it?

39:44.256 --> 39:46.801
What did her teacher say?
There must be a reason behind it.

39:47.301 --> 39:49.303
I have no idea.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.472
I don't know what to do.

39:51.555 --> 39:54.058
I don't know
how I'm going to face Li-sa now.

39:54.642 --> 39:56.435
I just don't know, honey.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.190
You will have to face her.
She's our daughter.

40:01.774 --> 40:04.485
We must take good care of her,
so things don't get worse.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.332
Ms. Gu!

40:18.416 --> 40:20.209
There's someone inside,
but she's not answering.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.002
Please open the door.

40:31.637 --> 40:32.805
Ms. Gu.

40:33.889 --> 40:35.015
Ms. Gu!

40:38.060 --> 40:40.438
SLEEPING PILLS

40:42.898 --> 40:43.899
Ms. Gu!

40:54.994 --> 40:56.829
Seeing how you're here,

40:57.955 --> 41:00.666
I guess Hae-won is fine. I was worried.

41:01.417 --> 41:02.543
Worried?

41:03.169 --> 41:05.129
If you were worried,
you should've gone right away.

41:05.212 --> 41:07.256
Why did you call me?

41:07.840 --> 41:12.011
Were you just going to let her die
if you couldn't reach me? Were you?

41:12.511 --> 41:14.472
Then I would've gone to her myself.

41:15.514 --> 41:16.974
She wouldn't want me to, though.

41:17.057 --> 41:21.145
That doesn't matter.
Even if you're going to divorce her…

41:23.814 --> 41:25.441
shouldn't you have gone to her

41:26.233 --> 41:27.943
once you knew her life was in danger?

41:31.530 --> 41:33.282
You went there in my place.

41:45.961 --> 41:49.423
At least,
I realized something from all of this.

41:50.883 --> 41:52.510
Now I know how useless

41:53.177 --> 41:55.679
and harmful you are to Ms. Gu.

41:59.850 --> 42:02.311
And one more thing.

42:04.188 --> 42:05.564
That I shouldn't let

42:06.440 --> 42:08.817
someone like you come close to my sister.

42:14.281 --> 42:18.118
At one point in your life,
these amazing two women both loved you.

42:20.996 --> 42:22.665
How did you turn into such a loser?

42:35.511 --> 42:37.346
<i>Ms. Jeong is withdrawing?</i>

42:37.846 --> 42:39.723
Artists from other fields

42:39.807 --> 42:43.352
will be participating
to take up where Ms. Jeong left off.

42:44.019 --> 42:46.188
No. Let me go and see Ms. Jeong.

42:46.272 --> 42:48.857
No. That is the gallery's job.

42:49.733 --> 42:52.236
You should only focus on your work.

42:52.319 --> 42:55.155
This project will proceed
as planned without her.

42:55.239 --> 42:56.657
And I'll make it successful.

42:57.741 --> 43:00.327
Mr. Woo is the pillar
of Korean architects. I can easily

43:00.411 --> 43:02.788
find artists who want to join
his last exhibition.

43:02.871 --> 43:04.081
Exactly.

43:04.582 --> 43:08.502
I'm asking why Ms. Jeong
wants to drop out of this great project.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.170
You want to be successful. Right?

43:11.255 --> 43:13.173
Then distance yourself from her.

43:14.425 --> 43:17.845
She wants you to succeed.

43:17.928 --> 43:18.929
I'm certain of that.

43:20.139 --> 43:22.308
So stop causing trouble.

43:22.391 --> 43:23.934
And only focus on your work.

43:25.728 --> 43:26.770
Why did you

43:27.563 --> 43:29.690
-call me here to tell me--
-Because…

43:31.650 --> 43:35.529
I'm the CEO of Hwain Gallery
in charge of protecting you.

43:36.280 --> 43:39.742
Ms. Jeong has
many powerful people around her.

43:40.951 --> 43:43.621
I don't want to cause trouble with her.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.273
I'll take him inside. You can go home.

44:11.357 --> 44:12.316
Ho-su.

44:14.318 --> 44:15.152
Are you okay?

44:16.737 --> 44:17.780
I want to play.

44:26.372 --> 44:27.790
What the hell are you doing?

44:27.873 --> 44:29.291
I just played with him.

44:30.709 --> 44:34.296
I'm glad that Ho-su still remembers me.

44:36.632 --> 44:37.633
Dad!

44:45.265 --> 44:46.684
I cut his umbilical cord,

44:48.227 --> 44:50.354
comforted him when he cried at night…

44:52.398 --> 44:53.857
fed him baby formula,

44:55.359 --> 44:57.152
and watched him take his first step.

44:59.571 --> 45:01.281
What were you doing in the meantime?

45:02.282 --> 45:03.534
You crazy bastard.

45:03.617 --> 45:05.994
Do you want the paper
that says he's not your son?

45:06.078 --> 45:08.914
A piece of paper
doesn't mean anything to me.

45:10.124 --> 45:12.084
It doesn't change the fact that

45:12.167 --> 45:15.087
I was the one who raised him
before you took him away from me.

45:24.096 --> 45:26.056
Ho-su, let's go inside.

45:29.268 --> 45:30.477
Ho-su.

46:04.178 --> 46:06.555
What happened? Why am I here?

46:06.638 --> 46:08.557
Why? Did you ask me why?

46:11.935 --> 46:15.105
Why didn't you tell me?
When did you break up with that jerk?

46:15.189 --> 46:17.274
You guys had just gotten back together!

46:18.734 --> 46:22.112
I told you he'd do it again.
Only the first time is hard.

46:24.239 --> 46:26.450
If you know that,
why do you live like this?

46:26.533 --> 46:29.411
So learn from my mistakes!
This is so frustrating!

46:29.495 --> 46:30.787
I didn't ask you for much.

46:30.871 --> 46:33.624
I only asked you to outlive me.
That's all I want!

46:33.707 --> 46:36.376
Gosh. Stop yelling at me.
You're hurting my ears.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.296
And you're totally wrong.
I'm not going to die.

46:41.089 --> 46:44.009
I couldn't sleep, so I took
some sleeping pills. Why the fuss?

46:44.092 --> 46:44.968
Fuss?

46:45.802 --> 46:48.263
You ended up in the ER
and scared the crap out of me.

46:48.347 --> 46:49.223
I'm making a fuss?

46:53.393 --> 46:54.561
Sorry.

46:55.687 --> 46:57.648
I shouldn't have taken them with alcohol.

46:59.274 --> 47:00.692
I won't do that again.

47:07.658 --> 47:08.992
Who's that guy?

47:10.244 --> 47:11.119
Guy?

47:11.203 --> 47:12.746
The guy who carried you to the ER.

47:12.829 --> 47:13.997
What guy?

47:14.873 --> 47:16.542
Didn't you bring me here?

47:16.625 --> 47:19.628
Look at you.
The drugs haven't worn off yet.

47:19.711 --> 47:22.130
I rushed there
after getting a call from him.

47:42.943 --> 47:45.862
You were totally out of it.
And I couldn't find your husband.

47:45.946 --> 47:47.406
And I was losing it too.

47:47.489 --> 47:50.450
If it weren't for him,
I would've been admitted too.

47:53.412 --> 47:55.831
He seemed boring and pale,

47:56.540 --> 47:59.334
but he was such a sweet guy.

48:00.502 --> 48:02.337
And he's nice and tall.

48:04.923 --> 48:06.675
A girl has to meet someone like him.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.386
Look at your asshole husband.

48:09.469 --> 48:12.681
I forgave him because he was good-looking.
See? Look what he did.

48:14.516 --> 48:17.185
Since this happened,
you should divorce him right away

48:17.269 --> 48:19.104
and date this guy. Okay?

48:23.692 --> 48:24.693
No.

48:25.277 --> 48:28.155
I can't. So don't bring it up again.

48:28.238 --> 48:29.489
Ms. Gu.

48:31.825 --> 48:32.993
Right.

48:33.076 --> 48:37.289
I was on my way out to buy abalones
to cook porridge. My goodness.

48:37.372 --> 48:39.499
Hey, your teacher is not well.

48:39.583 --> 48:41.877
She must stay home to recover.
Keep an eye on her.

48:41.960 --> 48:42.961
You're in charge.

48:44.379 --> 48:45.255
Gosh.

48:46.173 --> 48:47.758
You're not well? What's wrong?

48:47.841 --> 48:50.260
I'm okay. I feel refreshed
after getting some sleep.

48:51.094 --> 48:53.764
Are you done with your exams?
Did you do well?

48:54.389 --> 48:55.390
I aced them.

48:57.392 --> 48:58.685
And I got this.

49:03.565 --> 49:06.485
SEOUL FAMILY COURT
NOTICE FOR HEARING

49:06.568 --> 49:08.528
PETITIONER: GU HAE-WON
MINOR: LEE JU-YEONG

49:08.612 --> 49:11.031
THE DATE OF THE RULING
HAS BEEN SET AS FOLLOWING

49:18.997 --> 49:21.291
Give me ten big abalones.

49:21.375 --> 49:22.459
Sure.

49:22.542 --> 49:23.877
Give me big ones.

50:02.791 --> 50:04.000
<i>Going up.</i>

50:08.213 --> 50:09.798
The flowers are beautiful.

50:11.633 --> 50:13.552
I like roses too.

50:15.303 --> 50:18.306
I heard that flowers

50:18.390 --> 50:21.727
in subtle, pastel colors
are popular these days.

50:23.645 --> 50:26.440
But I still think
bright, colorful flowers are better.

50:27.858 --> 50:29.609
Colorful like those.

50:31.820 --> 50:34.948
Who are they for? Your wife?

50:36.992 --> 50:38.702
She must be so happy.

50:40.787 --> 50:42.372
<i>The doors are opening.</i>

50:54.134 --> 50:57.053
NAME: KIM SO-YEON

51:03.685 --> 51:04.853
So-yeon.

51:07.230 --> 51:08.982
I'm here.

51:11.568 --> 51:14.905
I'm sorry that I took so long.

51:18.450 --> 51:20.327
I just heard what happened--

51:27.083 --> 51:28.335
I'm sorry.

51:30.837 --> 51:32.088
I'm really…

51:40.013 --> 51:43.016
<i>My wife spent
all my retirement pay, savings,</i>

51:43.099 --> 51:45.393
<i>and money from our home equity loan</i>

51:46.269 --> 51:48.563
<i>on a patch of land without telling me.</i>

51:50.190 --> 51:51.525
<i>She was scammed.</i>

51:52.484 --> 51:55.654
<i>After keeping it from me
for a while, she fell ill.</i>

51:56.363 --> 51:57.739
<i>There was nothing we could do.</i>

51:58.949 --> 52:00.033
<i>However,</i>

52:01.201 --> 52:04.037
<i>I was too busy chasing
after those frauds to mourn for her.</i>

52:20.053 --> 52:21.263
Excuse me.

52:23.265 --> 52:25.225
You need to take your abalones!

52:25.851 --> 52:26.935
Jeong-yeon!

52:28.854 --> 52:30.230
Jeong-yeon!

52:34.776 --> 52:35.861
Was it not her?

52:47.581 --> 52:48.415
Ho-su.

52:51.126 --> 52:54.421
What did you do with that man earlier?

52:54.963 --> 52:58.133
He's really good at building sandcastles.

52:59.050 --> 53:01.011
He built everything I asked for.

53:04.014 --> 53:05.265
You're still here.

53:07.809 --> 53:11.062
You left work early because
your wife is sick. Why are you still here?

53:16.735 --> 53:18.236
You told Mr. Choi to prepare

53:19.154 --> 53:21.406
his admission documents
for a school in England.

53:21.489 --> 53:23.825
Should I have asked
your unconscious brother-in-law?

53:23.909 --> 53:25.410
That's not what I mean.

53:25.493 --> 53:26.786
Then what do you mean?

53:26.870 --> 53:29.122
Jeong-hwan only wants
to study just like his mom.

53:31.124 --> 53:33.960
Ho-su will get everything
including the hospital.

53:34.044 --> 53:36.296
I'll give everything to you, Ho-su.

53:38.715 --> 53:39.758
Mom.

53:42.969 --> 53:45.347
I don't expect anything
from any of you now.

53:46.056 --> 53:47.474
I raised you wrong.

53:48.099 --> 53:51.645
Everything you have all came from me.
You and your sister are so ungrateful.

53:57.525 --> 53:58.652
All right.

53:59.152 --> 54:01.571
Ho-su, why don't you have one of these?

54:01.655 --> 54:02.989
There.

54:04.115 --> 54:04.950
Open wide.

54:07.327 --> 54:11.414
There you go. Good boy.

54:11.498 --> 54:14.250
You'll get only the best stuff from me.

54:14.334 --> 54:16.795
Eat a lot, so you can be a healthy boy.

54:18.463 --> 54:20.298
Ho-su won't turn out like you.

54:20.382 --> 54:22.550
The hospital is running smoothly now.

54:23.093 --> 54:25.887
So I'll take care of him from A to Z
and raise him right.

54:27.389 --> 54:31.434
When will you stop being so greedy?

54:31.935 --> 54:33.520
Let this go and make peace--

54:33.603 --> 54:35.730
Change too suddenly and you die.

54:36.356 --> 54:37.899
Are you praying for my death?

54:37.983 --> 54:39.275
Mom.

54:40.402 --> 54:43.029
You weren't even sure if he was your son.

54:43.113 --> 54:45.865
Your wife might've been sleeping
with some guy for years.

54:45.949 --> 54:47.993
How can I trust you to raise my grandson?

54:48.076 --> 54:49.786
Can't you just drop it?

54:53.289 --> 54:54.374
Drop what?

54:58.628 --> 54:59.671
Li-sa, when did you--

54:59.754 --> 55:02.799
I called her over. Your wife is not well.

55:02.882 --> 55:04.467
I doubt that she'll feed the kids.

55:06.594 --> 55:07.595
Let's go.

55:21.985 --> 55:24.029
Come on. Not you too.

55:24.738 --> 55:27.157
Ho-su still needs us.

55:28.158 --> 55:31.703
Your mother can look after him.
But he still needs his parents.

55:32.704 --> 55:34.998
She keeps coddling him,

55:35.081 --> 55:37.292
so he won't even come to his mom.

55:39.169 --> 55:41.838
I'm not against him going
abroad to study. Let him finish--

55:41.921 --> 55:43.256
Seo Woo-jae was here.

55:44.758 --> 55:49.971
He was with Ho-su
at the playground in front of the house.

55:51.473 --> 55:54.476
I can't be there every time
to see if he's here or not.

55:55.268 --> 55:58.021
And it's not a bad idea
to learn their culture early on

55:58.813 --> 55:59.731
like my mom said.

56:02.150 --> 56:06.029
It'll be okay if we visit him there often.
We've done that for Li-sa,

56:08.156 --> 56:09.866
so we won't make mistakes this time.

56:31.888 --> 56:32.847
I'll get going then.

56:33.473 --> 56:34.641
Take care.

56:34.724 --> 56:37.102
I'll be back soon. Don't worry about me.

56:37.185 --> 56:39.854
-Bye. Good luck.
-Bye.

56:42.565 --> 56:44.484
-Take care.
-Go back inside.

56:58.123 --> 56:59.666
IN FRONT OF TAERIM HOSPITAL

57:03.545 --> 57:05.547
You won't be working at the hospital now?

57:08.258 --> 57:11.177
I've been meaning to call you, actually.

57:12.846 --> 57:16.141
I heard what you did.
Thank you for taking me to the ER.

57:18.518 --> 57:19.853
Are you okay now?

57:20.937 --> 57:22.272
Totally.

57:22.355 --> 57:25.692
It was nothing.
I had a hard time falling asleep.

57:29.154 --> 57:30.363
I mean it.

57:31.739 --> 57:33.700
If I was miserable to death,

57:33.783 --> 57:37.162
I'd kill the people who made me
miserable. Why would I die?

57:45.128 --> 57:47.005
I wasn't scared of death.

57:48.798 --> 57:50.842
Seeing how much pain life brought me,

57:51.801 --> 57:54.929
I wondered if the afterlife
would be better than living.

57:56.264 --> 57:57.390
That's what I thought.

58:01.686 --> 58:03.521
But when I saw you unconscious…

58:05.899 --> 58:07.650
I didn't care about that anymore.

58:09.110 --> 58:13.823
I kept praying.
"Please don't let her die."

58:15.283 --> 58:17.160
I ran to the ER like a madman.

58:21.873 --> 58:24.334
Gosh. It was really scary.

58:27.295 --> 58:28.880
Don't ever do that again.

58:29.422 --> 58:32.050
If you have trouble sleeping at night,
call me instead.

58:40.099 --> 58:41.976
I know you're uncomfortable around me.

58:43.144 --> 58:46.731
But I'm not asking you
to do anything with me right now.

58:47.482 --> 58:48.608
Just…

58:49.943 --> 58:52.904
Just let me help you.

58:53.988 --> 58:57.659
Let me do that little by little.

59:40.952 --> 59:42.453
I don't feel uncomfortable.

59:43.454 --> 59:46.708

JEONG HUI-JU BOUGHT MY WORK, I'M HONORED
FROM PUPIL TO RESPECTABLE ARTIST

1:00:43.848 --> 1:00:47.977
So you're accusing me of paying off
these reporters to write these articles?

1:00:48.061 --> 1:00:49.228
Didn't you?

1:00:52.857 --> 1:00:55.693
That's too bad. Unfortunately, I did not.

1:00:59.447 --> 1:01:02.867
I wouldn't buy off this many people
just to bring you down.

1:01:02.950 --> 1:01:04.994
I'm not that interested in you.

1:01:05.620 --> 1:01:06.871
And I have no time for it.

1:01:08.748 --> 1:01:13.044
Would your pride have been hurt less
if I was behind these articles?

1:01:17.799 --> 1:01:19.008
You seem disappointed.

1:01:20.176 --> 1:01:21.052
I knew it.

1:01:23.137 --> 1:01:24.806
You should have known your place.

1:01:27.308 --> 1:01:29.602
No matter how hard
Ms. Lee tries to help you,

1:01:29.686 --> 1:01:32.063
you see, one's character…

1:01:33.648 --> 1:01:37.360
is bound to surface eventually.

He's just leaving.

Have a seat.

This is absurd!
That school director was right about you.

1:02:31.164 --> 1:02:34.041
You set me up!
So you could take the money!

1:02:34.125 --> 1:02:36.377
You talked Ju-yeong into this!

1:02:36.461 --> 1:02:38.671
You did that to steal all of my money!

1:02:38.755 --> 1:02:40.506
How could you do this to me?

1:02:40.590 --> 1:02:42.759
How could you?

1:03:36.813 --> 1:03:39.857
I didn't expect to see you here.
I'm glad you are here.

1:03:40.358 --> 1:03:41.818
How dare you show up here?

1:03:43.402 --> 1:03:45.279
I was curious about his recovery.

1:03:46.030 --> 1:03:47.907
I want him to gain consciousness

1:03:49.033 --> 1:03:50.243
more than anyone.

1:03:51.494 --> 1:03:53.579
And I have the right to be here

1:03:53.663 --> 1:03:56.833
because after all,
I'm a witness to the accident.

1:03:59.001 --> 1:04:01.212
Once he wakes up, the lies you told--

1:04:01.295 --> 1:04:03.881
At least your husband
will believe it was an accident.

1:04:04.590 --> 1:04:08.511
No. He will have to
because what he did was worse than this.

1:04:11.305 --> 1:04:14.100
<i>It was unfair that
you wasted three years of your life.</i>

1:04:14.851 --> 1:04:17.645
<i>And I have new evidence
regarding your accident in Ireland.</i>

1:04:18.646 --> 1:04:20.606
<i>Why do you want to help me?</i>

1:04:21.607 --> 1:04:24.819
<i>Because helping you will help me.</i>

1:04:28.906 --> 1:04:31.367
He made me lie in bed
unconscious for three years.

1:04:32.994 --> 1:04:35.955
That's the kind of man your husband is.

1:04:37.290 --> 1:04:41.002
Hui-ju, you are living with a monster.

1:04:41.502 --> 1:04:43.629
He'll be here soon. You should go.

1:04:43.713 --> 1:04:45.172
I have no reason to avoid him.

1:04:45.256 --> 1:04:47.800
Discussing how
he'll compensate me for the years I lost

1:04:48.593 --> 1:04:50.469
sounds good too.

1:04:51.762 --> 1:04:54.599
Then let's talk about this outside.

1:04:55.266 --> 1:04:56.601
You said that back then too.

1:04:56.684 --> 1:05:00.146
You told me to leave Ho-su
and get out for a while that day.

1:05:01.898 --> 1:05:05.902
If I knew I would lose you and him,
I wouldn't have done as you said.

1:05:06.444 --> 1:05:08.029
I should've held out.

1:05:08.112 --> 1:05:09.780
You didn't lose anyone.

1:05:11.282 --> 1:05:13.034
I decided to leave you.

1:05:13.117 --> 1:05:14.493
Then come back to me.

1:05:14.577 --> 1:05:15.953
Come back to me with Ho-su.

1:05:16.913 --> 1:05:18.497
The three of us can start over.

1:05:19.665 --> 1:05:21.626
Bring Li-sa too if you want.

1:05:21.709 --> 1:05:23.044
I'm different now.

1:05:23.544 --> 1:05:24.712
I'll support you.

1:05:26.005 --> 1:05:27.298
I'll be successful.

1:05:28.549 --> 1:05:30.426
More successful than your husband.

1:05:39.352 --> 1:05:40.978
Where's Mr. Lee's cell phone?

1:05:42.563 --> 1:05:46.067
I know you took it.
There's something in it, isn't there?

1:05:46.984 --> 1:05:49.570
That's why you remembered
to take it even when he…

1:05:53.658 --> 1:05:55.785
HYEON-SEONG

1:05:59.956 --> 1:06:01.999
Get out. Let's talk outside.

1:06:02.083 --> 1:06:03.918
Let's talk outside. Please?

1:06:09.507 --> 1:06:11.884
<i>I'm on my way up.
Are you still in the room?</i>

1:06:15.012 --> 1:06:16.472
Please.

1:06:22.979 --> 1:06:25.231
Why are you out here?
Why didn't you go in?

1:06:25.314 --> 1:06:27.441
I didn't want to go in by myself.

1:06:29.986 --> 1:06:31.570
It's bad. He's still unconscious.

1:06:32.154 --> 1:06:33.531
Is Li-sa's therapy over?

1:06:33.614 --> 1:06:37.076
Oh, my. She should be done soon.
I'll go check on her.

1:06:37.159 --> 1:06:40.037
I'll go too.
We should work on this together.

1:06:40.538 --> 1:06:41.414
She's our daughter.

1:06:55.261 --> 1:06:58.639
You won't do it without Ms. Jeong?
Come on, don't do this again.

1:06:59.223 --> 1:07:00.933
This is an important time for you.

1:07:01.017 --> 1:07:03.102
This is a great chance
to fix their prejudice.

1:07:03.185 --> 1:07:05.855
Exactly. That's why
I must do it with Ms. Jeong.

1:07:06.897 --> 1:07:08.441
This was a joint project.

1:07:08.524 --> 1:07:10.943
If she drops out,
what will people say about that?

1:07:11.027 --> 1:07:12.820
How many more times must I tell you?

1:07:12.903 --> 1:07:16.615
You must distance yourself
from Ms. Jeong to protect yourself.

1:07:16.699 --> 1:07:19.368
Exactly. I asked you several times
why that's the case.

1:07:30.838 --> 1:07:33.841
<i>You don't love me. Wake up!</i>

1:07:33.924 --> 1:07:36.218
If you approach her again,

1:07:36.302 --> 1:07:38.220
I won't be able to stop her.

1:07:38.304 --> 1:07:41.766
If this video reaches the public,
your career is over before it even starts.

1:07:42.433 --> 1:07:43.809
This isn't what it looks like.

1:07:43.893 --> 1:07:45.519
Of course you'd say that.

1:07:45.603 --> 1:07:46.687
It's not!

1:07:46.771 --> 1:07:49.231
Right. I don't know
what happened between you two.

1:07:49.315 --> 1:07:52.610
What's important is that people will
only believe what they want to.

1:07:52.693 --> 1:07:54.862
And people will believe
Ms. Jeong over you.

1:07:55.446 --> 1:07:56.989
This is a lie!

1:07:59.784 --> 1:08:02.745
That's not true! It's a lie!

1:08:08.292 --> 1:08:09.418
It's not true.

1:08:14.507 --> 1:08:15.966
That's a lie.

1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:25.643
I lived here only briefly,
but I still have a lot of stuff to pack.

1:08:27.686 --> 1:08:30.106
It was so easy to start.

1:08:30.189 --> 1:08:31.774
But breaking up is difficult.

1:08:34.318 --> 1:08:36.570
Why do we always make the same mistake?

1:08:38.864 --> 1:08:40.241
What brings you here anyway?

1:08:43.911 --> 1:08:46.956
I know I don't deserve it,
but I'm here to ask you for a favor.

1:08:48.707 --> 1:08:49.959
Please stop Woo-jae.

1:08:50.751 --> 1:08:52.753
He will listen to you.

1:08:54.713 --> 1:08:56.090
Remember what you told me?

1:08:57.299 --> 1:08:59.343
That I would destroy myself

1:08:59.844 --> 1:09:02.596
because of my victim mentality.

1:09:04.431 --> 1:09:06.559
You were right, as you can see.

1:09:07.768 --> 1:09:11.730
And I can now understand
that you will not crumble

1:09:12.565 --> 1:09:13.899
no matter how hard I try.

1:09:15.985 --> 1:09:18.779
It was impossible to achieve something

1:09:18.863 --> 1:09:22.408
only out of hatred and resentment.

1:09:27.121 --> 1:09:28.539
But Woo-jae isn't like me.

1:09:29.039 --> 1:09:32.209
His feelings for you,
whatever they may be…

1:09:33.878 --> 1:09:36.088
He firmly believes that it's love.

1:09:36.630 --> 1:09:40.301
It's your responsibility
to cut off his obsession with you.

1:09:42.136 --> 1:09:43.679

1:09:44.638 --> 1:09:46.891
you would never break down like me. Right?

1:09:49.018 --> 1:09:52.938
I will be watching you to see

1:09:53.022 --> 1:09:56.275
if you can do what you so proudly claimed.

1:10:35.689 --> 1:10:36.732
Why'd you come?

1:10:40.152 --> 1:10:41.862
Ms. Lee called me.

1:10:42.738 --> 1:10:44.073
She's worried about you.

1:10:46.075 --> 1:10:48.327
She doesn't know that we broke up.
