00:03.858 --> 00:05.726
My new sheets
from the "Under A Dollar" store

00:05.727 --> 00:07.694
feel so luxurious,

00:07.695 --> 00:09.663
like they could maybe cost
over a dollar,

00:09.664 --> 00:11.999
maybe even 2 or 3.

00:12.500 --> 00:16.703
Yup. It was a good day
over at the "Under A Dollar."

00:16.704 --> 00:20.941
Steak, bed stuff,
and my new steak eatin' chair.

00:20.992 --> 00:23.560
Doesn't it worry you that
you got that meat and furniture

00:23.561 --> 00:26.263
for the price
of an Angry Birds update?

00:26.264 --> 00:29.399
Yeah, it worries me
that it'll never happen again.

00:29.900 --> 00:33.737
Sheets and steak?
Never dared to dream it.

00:33.738 --> 00:35.572
These sheets
smell amazing too,

00:35.573 --> 00:37.841
thanks to that
one little fabric softener ball,

00:37.842 --> 00:39.276
also under a dollar.

00:39.277 --> 00:42.679
I dated a guy
with one ball once.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.681
He was all self-conscious,
but I told him,

00:44.682 --> 00:47.984
"No big deal.
It's just as ugly as two."

00:47.985 --> 00:50.320
I am going to get
such a good night's--

00:50.321 --> 00:51.825
Oh, sheet!

00:55.026 --> 00:58.128
"Thread count: Yes.

00:58.129 --> 01:01.298
Washing instructions:

01:01.599 --> 01:03.300
Are you sure
you want to sit in that?

01:03.301 --> 01:05.869
Woman, don't talk to me
while I'm eatin' my steak!

Ow!

01:38.913 --> 01:42.148
What?
A candy trail.

01:42.399 --> 01:45.401
God, are you just
getting to me now?

01:45.402 --> 01:47.737
You do work

01:47.988 --> 01:49.689
I'm not God,

01:49.690 --> 01:51.490
I did answer your roommate's
prayers last night.

01:51.491 --> 01:52.491
[Laughs]

01:52.492 --> 01:53.759
Andy!

01:53.760 --> 01:55.462
So how'd this happen?

01:55.463 --> 01:59.265
Where'd you guys find
each other again? Rematch.com?

01:59.266 --> 02:02.168
Empty-vajay date?

02:02.919 --> 02:04.103
No, last night,
I thought,

02:04.104 --> 02:05.638
"Well, these sheets
are already ruined,

02:05.639 --> 02:07.974
so I might as well
really ruin them with sex,"

02:07.975 --> 02:09.809
so I called Andy.

02:09.810 --> 02:13.179
And I was obviously flattered,
so I came over.

02:13.380 --> 02:16.649
Well, I hope you guys spent
more than $1 for condoms.

02:16.650 --> 02:18.751
- Hey, there are two things
I never skimp on:

02:18.752 --> 02:20.920
Condoms and candy.
And Max, did you see

02:20.921 --> 02:22.755
what I left over there
on the kitchen counter for you?

02:22.756 --> 02:25.725
Condoms? Candy?
Condoms full of candy?

02:25.726 --> 02:27.694
Well, now, you're
going to be disappointed,

02:27.695 --> 02:31.364
because
it's just candy.

02:31.365 --> 02:33.232
Ooh,
all my favorites!

02:33.233 --> 02:36.102
I wonder if I can get diabetes
before breakfast.

02:36.103 --> 02:38.604
Thanks, Andy.

02:38.605 --> 02:40.740
Ha ha! That candy
was just a decoy,

02:40.741 --> 02:43.609
so you didn't see my push pop
when I got out of bed.

02:45.079 --> 02:48.448
So... Are you and Andy
back together?

02:48.449 --> 02:51.617
No. It was just
a one-time thing.

02:51.618 --> 02:53.186
Look at you.

02:53.187 --> 02:55.688
You're like the Greek goddess
of booty calls.

02:55.689 --> 02:57.890
Aphro-whitey.

02:57.891 --> 03:01.260
Kind of proud of myself.
My very first booty call.

03:01.261 --> 03:02.962
Well, actually,
it was a booty tweet.

03:02.963 --> 03:05.231
Booty's up
with the times.

03:05.232 --> 03:07.133
Technically,
booty call's been around

03:07.134 --> 03:09.769
since the old-timey times.
Alexander Graham Bell's

03:09.770 --> 03:13.339
very first phone call
was "Hey, you up?"

03:15.242 --> 03:18.911
Hey, so, um, I gotta go.
Is that cool?

03:18.912 --> 03:21.147
Oh, super cool, sure.

03:21.148 --> 03:23.583
What do we do, kiss?
High-five?

03:23.584 --> 03:25.551
Max, what do you do
in this situation?

03:25.552 --> 03:27.787
I usually wave at him
with my arm clenched,

03:27.788 --> 03:30.323
'cause I'm hiding his wallet
in it.

03:31.658 --> 03:34.527
Well,
nice seeing you.

03:38.265 --> 03:39.465
I don't usually
do the salute,

03:39.466 --> 03:42.135
but okay,
that can be your thing.

03:44.972 --> 03:46.606
Earl,
here's my last check.

03:46.607 --> 03:50.109
Can you tip me out?
I have a possible booty call.

03:50.110 --> 03:51.844
Well, Caroline,
you've reached

03:51.845 --> 03:55.348
a new place of familiarity
with me.

03:55.349 --> 03:59.352
Unfortunately, I've not reached
that same place with you.

04:01.321 --> 04:03.422
Can you cover my tables?

04:03.423 --> 04:05.158
I've been doing that
since you started working here,

04:05.159 --> 04:06.592
so yes.

04:06.593 --> 04:07.994
Good, 'cause I'm gonna
text Andy

04:07.995 --> 04:09.629
for another booty call,
and maybe this time

04:09.630 --> 04:11.697
we can go out
and have a booty breakfast.

04:11.698 --> 04:16.935
As the President of the casual
sex society, local chapter,

04:16.937 --> 04:18.637
I call bull on your booty.

04:18.639 --> 04:20.439
What?
It's a booty call.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.641
Not with you it isn't.

04:21.642 --> 04:23.209
You think
that booty breakfast

04:23.210 --> 04:24.710
will maybe lead
to a booty dinner

04:24.711 --> 04:26.612
then maybe booty engaged
and booty married

04:26.613 --> 04:28.681
and have a couple booty kids
and a booty retirement home

04:28.682 --> 04:30.349
and then
booty die together.

04:30.660 --> 04:32.819
That's not true.
He'll die before me,

04:32.820 --> 04:35.888
then I'll take
a dance class.

04:38.325 --> 04:41.194
What are you doing?
Do you have to pee?

04:41.195 --> 04:44.864
No, I feel something...
[Whispering] down there.

04:44.865 --> 04:48.568
Yeah, you woke it up.
Now it's hungry.

04:53.807 --> 04:58.578
But you don't take it back
to the same restaurant.

04:58.579 --> 05:01.514
What is that and why is it
wearing a bow tie?

05:01.515 --> 05:05.151
Maybe because an actual tie
would drag on the ground.

05:06.854 --> 05:09.088
Speaking
of "dragging on the ground,"

05:09.089 --> 05:11.257
maybe you could drag an antelope
back to your cave

05:11.258 --> 05:13.726
and have sex with it.

05:13.727 --> 05:16.662
See, I have
a sense of humor too.

05:16.663 --> 05:19.832
That's one of the attributes
on my online dating profile.

05:19.833 --> 05:22.235
Han, are you all dressed up
because you're expecting a date?

05:22.236 --> 05:24.170
Oh, I'm expecting
a lot more than a date.

05:24.171 --> 05:26.339
Our profiles
matched us perfectly.

05:26.340 --> 05:27.907
This might be the one.

05:27.908 --> 05:29.609
Which one? The first one?
The only one?

05:29.610 --> 05:32.278
The one that accidentally
steps on you?

05:32.279 --> 05:35.047
She was supposed to be here
a half hour ago.

05:35.048 --> 05:37.283
Well, you know,
subways run late,

05:37.284 --> 05:40.786
especially if you don't get on them
because you don't really exist

05:40.787 --> 05:43.689
and are a money-scamming man
in Nairobi.

05:44.690 --> 05:47.193
Hi, I'm looking for Han Lee,
the owner.

05:47.194 --> 05:50.096
There she is.
Pretty, blonde, and clearly not a man.

05:50.097 --> 05:52.365
Who's laughing now?

05:52.366 --> 05:54.367
You shouldn't
jump to conclusions.

05:54.368 --> 05:56.435
I once had a date
with a blonde woman.

05:56.436 --> 06:00.106
Turns out, the curtains
matched the penis on that one.

06:03.043 --> 06:05.978
Hello. Are you Ashley?
I'm Han Lee.

06:05.979 --> 06:08.714
Hi. Nice to meet you.

06:08.715 --> 06:11.617
I left something in my car
I'll be right back.

06:13.587 --> 06:15.254
Is she coming back?

06:15.255 --> 06:18.293
Han, Jesus is coming back
before she is.

06:22.729 --> 06:24.664
Han,
you're too good for her.

06:24.665 --> 06:26.065
I don't understand.

06:26.066 --> 06:29.068
We were 97% compatible
on the website.

06:29.069 --> 06:30.970
Let me see your profile.

06:30.971 --> 06:33.472
- Who's that?
- That's me.

06:33.473 --> 06:38.811
No, that's the hot Asian star
from <i>Hawaii Five-0.</i>

06:38.812 --> 06:40.813
What?
We kinda look alike.

06:41.814 --> 06:43.582
The only thing
you have in common

06:43.583 --> 06:48.688
with this guy from <i>Hawaii Five-0</i>
is that you are 5'0".

06:51.691 --> 06:53.759
And Han, "Athletic"?

06:53.760 --> 06:55.461
In school, I ran track.

06:55.462 --> 06:59.966
Running under the hurdles
doesn't count as track.

06:59.967 --> 07:01.701
Han,
this is totally lame.

07:01.702 --> 07:03.602
Let me help you
find the right girl.

07:03.603 --> 07:06.105
You give me so much joy
at your expense,

07:06.106 --> 07:08.007
I feel like
I need to give back.

07:08.008 --> 07:11.877
Thank you, Max, I'm insulted
and honored at the same time.

07:13.380 --> 07:15.514
Seeing Han and Ashley together
for that one second

07:15.515 --> 07:17.683
made me realize I want to be
back in a relationship.

07:17.684 --> 07:19.285
I'm going to text Andy.

07:19.286 --> 07:22.388
I knew it. I called that.
I booty called that.

07:22.889 --> 07:25.224

is being revoked.

07:25.225 --> 07:29.128
Unfortunately, Andy is still
an active member, very active.

07:29.129 --> 07:30.629
What are you talking about?

07:30.630 --> 07:33.799
I'm saying
he has an active member.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.501
He told me
he's seeing someone.

07:35.502 --> 07:37.003
He's seeing someone?

07:37.004 --> 07:39.372
Actually,
he's seeing a few someones.

07:39.373 --> 07:41.474
How many someones?

07:41.475 --> 07:43.809
Oh, it's back.

07:43.810 --> 07:45.511
Do you think this itch
has anything to do

07:45.512 --> 07:47.313
with those many someones?

07:47.314 --> 07:49.348
Do you think
he gave me something?

07:49.349 --> 07:52.985
Well, if he did,
you just gave it to the counter.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.841

08:12.842 --> 08:16.178
It's all red and chunky.
I hope that's not what you have.

08:16.179 --> 08:18.013
Max, that's salsa.

08:22.284 --> 08:26.087
- But look.
- Oh! What the hell is that?

08:26.088 --> 08:29.691
What the hell does Jen
from New Rochelle have?

08:29.692 --> 08:31.059
It's a rash.
Jen says

08:31.060 --> 08:33.227
"It was bad for awhile,
then disappeared."

08:33.229 --> 08:36.765
So Jen came down
with a case of "My father"?

08:37.765 --> 08:39.268
A rash.
That doesn't sound so bad.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.702
I could live with a rash.

08:40.703 --> 08:43.639
Except Dr. Web thinks
it might be herpes.

08:44.140 --> 08:48.443
Trust me, I don't have it.
Jen's obviously a whore.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.412
Well,
does it look like this?

08:50.413 --> 08:52.881
I don't know, I can't quite
bend over far enough to see it.

08:52.882 --> 08:55.083
Fine.
I'll look at it.

08:55.084 --> 08:57.252
What? No!

08:57.503 --> 09:00.972
What?
Jen showed me hers.

09:00.973 --> 09:03.308
I'm sure
mine is just a rash.

09:03.309 --> 09:07.045
Cathy from Colorado says,
"I thought it was just a rash,

09:07.046 --> 09:11.583
but guess what?
Rashes are always herpes."

09:12.334 --> 09:14.186
I can't have herpes.

09:14.187 --> 09:17.589
Sex is the only fun thing
poor people can afford.

09:17.890 --> 09:21.393
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.595
Just let me see it.

09:23.596 --> 09:26.231
Max, I could not continue
to live here if you ever saw it.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.400
Well, then definitely
let me see it.

09:28.901 --> 09:33.405
It's okay, I have one too,
except mine has a "Welcome" mat.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.609
I know, I'll just
take a picture of it.

09:38.110 --> 09:41.279
And that's how Kim Kardashian
became famous.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.682
It's bad enough I'm taking
a picture of my vagina,

09:43.683 --> 09:46.418
I'm doing it
with an iPhone 3.

09:50.022 --> 09:52.290
Too dark.
Needs a flash.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.793
All right,
but watch out for red-eye.

10:01.067 --> 10:05.270
Ohh... There she is.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.239
Yeah, that's definitely
something.

10:07.240 --> 10:11.109
- Let me see it.
- Wait, it needs a filter.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.879
Lo-Fi, no.
Valencia, no.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.747
Oh, maybe just a border.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.482
Just give it to me.

10:17.483 --> 10:20.652
Oh ho,
that's not good.

10:20.653 --> 10:21.953
I just want to go
on the record.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.154
It doesn't always
look like that.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.390
It's actually quite pretty.

10:25.391 --> 10:28.293
Well, now it has
a good personality.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.061
[Knocking at the door]

10:30.062 --> 10:32.330
Oh, that's probably
the Center for Disease Control

10:32.331 --> 10:34.399
coming to get me
with their van.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.269
I'll get it.
The walking helps.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.670
Oh, my God.

10:38.671 --> 10:41.172
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

10:41.173 --> 10:46.144
Hi, girls! I got Chinese food.
You want to hang out?

10:46.145 --> 10:48.246
Sophie,
this isn't a good time.

10:50.082 --> 10:53.585
Uhohh, someone's got
the herp walk.

10:56.188 --> 10:59.090
Sophie, we don't know what
it is. It could just be a rash.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.660
Yeah, it could,
but it probably isn't.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.094
- Yeah, let me see.
- Stop it.

11:03.095 --> 11:07.165
What? It's okay,
I was a nurse back in Poland.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.868
You've heard
of "Doctors Without Borders"?

11:09.869 --> 11:14.105
Well, we were
"nurses without credentials."

11:14.106 --> 11:18.343
Yeah. Our motto was:
"What? We want to help."

11:18.344 --> 11:19.811
Quit! Stop it!

11:19.812 --> 11:22.280
Max,
don't show Sophie--

11:22.281 --> 11:25.383
Oh, my <i>God!</i>

11:25.384 --> 11:31.856
Oh, I mean, come on,
slap a filter on this thing.

11:31.857 --> 11:35.493
Okay. I'm done. I'm done
with nurses without credentials

11:35.494 --> 11:37.329
or doctors without faces.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.130
Tomorrow,
I'm going to a free clinic.

11:39.131 --> 11:43.034
Well, is real bad.
You better run, don't herp walk.

11:44.971 --> 11:49.040
Whoa, this thing says one
out of six people have herpes!

11:51.410 --> 11:53.745
Uh-ohh.

11:53.746 --> 11:56.648
Max, anyone in here
could be the "one in six."

11:56.649 --> 11:59.084
Are you sure you don't want
to get tested while we're here?

11:59.085 --> 12:00.652
Nah, I'm bad at tests.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.487
Besides,
if you can't afford a doctor,

12:02.488 --> 12:04.823
it's better to just spend
whatever money you got on weed

12:04.824 --> 12:07.325
to help you forget
whatever you got.

12:07.326 --> 12:08.860
Caroline Channing.

12:08.861 --> 12:10.228
That's so embarrassing.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.163
Could she say my name
any louder?

12:12.164 --> 12:14.165
[Shouting]
Caroline Channing!

12:14.866 --> 12:16.901
- I guess she could.
- Miss Channing,

12:16.902 --> 12:18.937
now, you wrote here
the reason for your visit

12:18.938 --> 12:22.874
is an "Uncomfortable sensation
in your nether regions."

12:22.875 --> 12:24.909
Could you be
more specific?

12:24.910 --> 12:26.411
Is there
a more private area

12:26.412 --> 12:28.747
we could discuss
my private area?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.615
Oh, I'm sorry!

12:30.616 --> 12:32.851
Let me bring out
my hot air balloon

12:32.852 --> 12:37.555
and we'll take
a tour of the city...

12:37.556 --> 12:41.693
While we discuss your
uncomfortable lady sensation.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.029
Shirley,
the only lady sensation

12:44.030 --> 12:46.197
I'm seeing in this office
is you.

12:46.198 --> 12:48.199
Oh, well,
I appreciate that, girl.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.535
I try to lighten the load
with a little humor.

12:50.536 --> 12:52.704
Well, I don't need the jokes.
Thank you.

12:52.705 --> 12:55.807
Oh, they not for you.
They for us. [Chuckles]

12:56.308 --> 13:00.078
I need to be tested for...
[Whispering] herpes.

13:00.079 --> 13:03.948
Girl, you sound like you're
doing a perfume ad for herpes.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.284
Just give her the phone.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.487
Mm.

13:09.488 --> 13:10.955
Well,
this is either herpes

13:10.956 --> 13:13.058
or something
I ain't never seen before.

13:13.059 --> 13:16.161
Now, the HSV-2
is not a standard pap.

13:16.162 --> 13:20.398
It is a specific blood test,
and it is $250.

13:20.399 --> 13:22.734
Well, the only way I know
how to get money for that test

13:22.735 --> 13:26.104
in the next hour
will probably give me an STD.

13:26.105 --> 13:28.406
Can we maybe work out
a cheaper price?

13:28.407 --> 13:30.575
We're waitresses nearby
at the Williamsburg diner.

13:30.576 --> 13:33.178
I can give you free food
for as long as I work there.

13:33.179 --> 13:36.514
And now that I may have this,
I mean, where else am I going?

13:36.515 --> 13:39.451
Blood test or denial?

13:39.452 --> 13:41.319
Blood test.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.354
I'll just ask Andy
for a loan.

13:43.355 --> 13:44.622
But it's actually
more of a buy,

13:44.623 --> 13:46.758
since he already
ruined the property.

13:46.759 --> 13:49.327
Classic
"You break it, you buy it."

13:49.328 --> 13:51.429
Hey, Max.

13:51.430 --> 13:54.766
Good to see you.

13:59.271 --> 14:01.506
I hooked up with that guy
once.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.275
Um, do you know
what he was here for

14:04.276 --> 14:06.711
and how long he's had it?

14:06.712 --> 14:09.315
You know what, give me one
of those sexual history forms.

14:10.816 --> 14:13.451
This sexual history list
is hard.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.386
Can't it just be
a top ten?

14:15.387 --> 14:17.522
Well,
Andy's not here yet.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.957
He's probably busy
getting busy

14:18.958 --> 14:21.826
with his ragtag team
of gutter skanks.

14:21.827 --> 14:23.695
"Gutter skanks"?
Didn't I see them open

14:23.696 --> 14:24.829
for Cannibal Corpse?

14:24.830 --> 14:27.298
Look,
you need to relax.

14:27.299 --> 14:29.834
Why don't we just get a drink,
or nine?

14:29.835 --> 14:32.237
Two double Jack and Gingers.
Oh, yeah, Jack.

14:32.238 --> 14:34.873
Number 38.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.909
Oh, and that Ginger.
Number 39.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.677
Max, look,
Jen from New Rochelle

14:39.678 --> 14:41.312
put up a new update
on WebMD.

14:41.313 --> 14:44.082
She says her life has gotten
so much better

14:44.083 --> 14:47.986
after joining a site
called "His-and-Herpes."

14:47.987 --> 14:50.588
Hi, Andy.
Have a seat.

14:50.589 --> 14:53.324
Remember, you don't know
that he gave it to you,

14:53.325 --> 14:55.160
and you don't know
that you have it, so be cool.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.028
Don't worry, Max,
I got this.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.597
And Andy, I got that!

14:59.598 --> 15:02.500
Oh!
I thought it was annoying

15:02.501 --> 15:05.036
when people took pictures
of their food.

15:05.037 --> 15:07.105
When were you gonna
tell me, Andy?

15:07.106 --> 15:08.873
When my vagina
burst into flames

15:08.874 --> 15:11.376
and became
an actual burning bush?

15:12.377 --> 15:13.945
Wait, that's yours?

15:13.946 --> 15:16.181
Worst selfie ever,
right?

15:17.182 --> 15:20.084
Wow,
I didn't recognize it.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.587
Was it out in the sun?

15:22.588 --> 15:26.357
You owe me $250
for the blood test, Andy.

15:26.358 --> 15:28.193
And $9 for that drink.

15:28.194 --> 15:31.129
Look,
everybody just calm down.

15:31.130 --> 15:34.032
Andy, you may or may not
have given her herpes.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.100
She may or may not be
overreacting.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.703
I may or may not have
slept with that bartender.

15:38.704 --> 15:42.373
He is my type, and yet,
he has a job, so he's not,

15:42.374 --> 15:45.977
and he goes
in the "Maybes."

15:45.978 --> 15:47.879
Look, Caroline,
I'm really sorry,

15:47.880 --> 15:49.380
but I am totally clean.

15:49.381 --> 15:51.749
Since we broke up,
I have only had safe sex

15:51.750 --> 15:54.219
with a special ed teacher
and a dental hygienist.

15:54.220 --> 15:57.155
I mean, that job has "hygiene"
right in the title.

15:57.956 --> 15:59.924
Wait, oh,
there were a couple of times

15:59.925 --> 16:02.927
where I did have unsafe sex
with myself.

16:02.928 --> 16:06.397
But only when I couldn't sleep.
And a lot of other times.

16:06.398 --> 16:09.400
I will go get tested tomorrow,
but please, in the meantime,

16:09.401 --> 16:11.169
try not to go
to the worst-case scenario.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.937
I'm not going
to the worst-case scenario,

16:12.938 --> 16:14.939
but if we both have it,
no one else is going to want us,

16:14.940 --> 16:16.941
so we should just
get married.

16:16.942 --> 16:18.910
"You gave me herpes,
now you have to marry me."

16:18.911 --> 16:21.412
You want to save that gold
for our wedding vows?

16:21.413 --> 16:24.315
Well, if you don't use it,
I will.

16:33.686 --> 16:35.553
I can't wait till tomorrow
for my test results.

16:35.604 --> 16:37.004
I'm going to call
the clinic.

16:37.005 --> 16:38.739
You've left, like,
ten messages.

16:38.740 --> 16:41.876
You're acting like the clinic's
crazy ex-girlfriend.

16:41.877 --> 16:43.577
Well, I'm leaving
another message.

16:43.578 --> 16:44.912
Hand me my phone.

16:49.184 --> 16:52.253
What? I have to stay healthy
in case you have it.

16:52.254 --> 16:55.723
Someone's got to pick up
your welfare checks.

16:55.724 --> 16:59.860
Well, this is my life now.
Working at a diner with herpes.

16:59.861 --> 17:01.429
The very best
I can ever hope to be

17:01.430 --> 17:04.498
is a mentor
for a younger girl with herpes.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.868
Hi.
Maybe you can help me.

17:08.869 --> 17:12.573
Well, with that smile and
my bad heart, I'll die trying.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.241
[Laughs]

17:14.242 --> 17:16.143
I'm looking
for the overly-emotional girl

17:16.144 --> 17:17.811
that works here
as a waitress.

17:18.563 --> 17:21.048
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

17:21.049 --> 17:24.085
Am I dying?
Are you the angel of death?

17:24.086 --> 17:26.654
I think I found her.

17:26.655 --> 17:28.556
Can we have a seat
for a minute?

17:28.557 --> 17:30.624
Max, Max,
she wants to sit down.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.426
Come here
and hold my hand.

17:32.427 --> 17:37.264
Oh, I'll hold your hand
after I find out what you have.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.966
No need to be
all dramatic.

17:38.967 --> 17:41.802
I just came to tell you
that your blood test came back,

17:41.803 --> 17:46.741
but I am not allowed to give you
the results without a doctor.

17:46.742 --> 17:47.975
You're not?

17:47.976 --> 17:49.410
No, I am not.

17:49.411 --> 17:53.414
That's a neg-a-tive,
a neg-a-tive.

17:53.415 --> 17:55.950
Wait. Are you saying
it's negative?

17:55.951 --> 17:59.019
I could not tell you that.

17:59.020 --> 18:01.922
I also could not tell you
that it was probably

18:01.923 --> 18:04.992
an allergic reaction to soap
or laundry detergent.

18:04.993 --> 18:08.129
Oh, my God! Max, it was
that fabric softener ball

18:08.130 --> 18:10.531
from the "Under A Dollar" store.
Oh!

18:10.532 --> 18:14.935
I'm not a cheap whore.
I'm just poor.

18:14.936 --> 18:18.105
Shirley, it was really cool
of you to come all the way in,

18:18.106 --> 18:20.274
because we were really
very upset,

18:20.275 --> 18:23.344
so upset that a caring
medical professional like you

18:23.345 --> 18:25.012
would probably
help us out

18:25.013 --> 18:28.816
with something
for our anxiety or parties.

18:28.817 --> 18:31.185
Nice try.

18:31.186 --> 18:33.954
But I'm not here just
out of the goodness of my heart.

18:33.955 --> 18:37.324
I'm here for my free fries.
I'm starving.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.893
I haven't been able to eat
since you showed me

18:38.894 --> 18:40.898
that phone picture
of your bits and pieces.

18:43.899 --> 18:46.867
- Fries coming right up.
- And thank you so much.

18:46.868 --> 18:49.136
Oh, it's nice
to give out good news.

18:49.137 --> 18:52.039
What about you? When can I
give you some good news?

18:52.040 --> 18:53.574
I'll be in tomorrow,
I'm just waiting

18:53.575 --> 18:56.644
for a call back
from John Mayer.

18:58.547 --> 19:01.315
Hi,
I'm looking for Han Lee.

19:01.316 --> 19:03.384
Oh, that's the girl
I set up Han with.

19:03.385 --> 19:07.721
No visible Adam's apple.
Go for it.

19:07.722 --> 19:11.058
Oh, Max, she's very pretty.
Are you sure she'll go for me?

19:11.059 --> 19:13.260
I think she might.
Let's go say hi.

19:13.761 --> 19:16.197
Hi, you must be Jen.
Jen, this is Han.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.899
Han, this is Jen
from New Rochelle.

19:18.900 --> 19:20.501
- Hi.
- Hello.

19:20.502 --> 19:23.204
Jen from New Rochelle?
Max, no!

19:23.205 --> 19:24.572
What?
It could just be

19:24.573 --> 19:28.442
a reaction
to her laundry detergent.

19:31.446 --> 19:35.616
I'm clean!
Totally clean!

19:37.852 --> 19:40.688
Shirley was as surprised
as I am.

19:40.689 --> 19:43.057
Oh, Max,
I'm so happy for you.

19:43.058 --> 19:45.593
Yep, I dodged a bullet,
but from now on,

19:45.594 --> 19:47.094
I'm going to be
a little more discerning.

19:47.095 --> 19:49.263
I'm not 13 anymore.

19:49.764 --> 19:52.533
So I just texted Andy and
told him it was a false alarm.

19:52.534 --> 19:54.301
- I didn't have it.
- What did he say?

19:54.302 --> 19:56.704
He said,
"Hey, you up?"

19:56.705 --> 19:58.906
But I'm definitely not
gonna go.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.441
Am I?

20:00.442 --> 20:01.876
All right,
here's the thing.

20:01.877 --> 20:04.044
This is about something bigger
than Andy.

20:04.045 --> 20:05.579
Actually,
Andy's quite--

20:05.580 --> 20:07.481
Oh, I know.

20:07.482 --> 20:09.149
Came out to get
a drink of water.

20:09.150 --> 20:11.552
Saw it, loved it.

20:12.353 --> 20:14.455
Look, I'm going to
keep this simple.

20:14.456 --> 20:18.492
You are using Andy
to fill a hole.

20:20.295 --> 20:24.064
Yes, Max,
that's how sex works.

20:24.065 --> 20:26.233
Ever since
the business closed,

20:26.234 --> 20:27.835
you've got
all this free time,

20:27.836 --> 20:29.670
and you don't know
what to do with yourself.

20:29.671 --> 20:33.741
I hear you. You're right,
ever since the business closed,

20:33.742 --> 20:35.442
I do have a huge hole.

20:35.443 --> 20:37.745
I know. Came out
to get a drink of water.

20:37.746 --> 20:40.147
Saw it, loved it.

20:40.148 --> 20:42.016
Max, I know we said
we were gonna

20:42.017 --> 20:44.852
do the cupcake business again,
but now we have to make it real.

20:44.853 --> 20:46.520
I mean,
I'm a businesswoman.

20:46.521 --> 20:48.155
I need to have a business,
or apparently, I'm gonna

20:48.156 --> 20:50.324
put someone else's business
into my business.

20:50.325 --> 20:51.525
[Knocking at the door]

20:51.526 --> 20:53.027
So Max, tomorrow,
we start again,

20:53.028 --> 20:55.029
and this time,
we have to give it our all.

20:55.030 --> 20:59.199
Clear vaginas, full hearts,
can't lose.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.936
Hey, girls.

21:01.937 --> 21:03.370
I came down
with a solution

21:03.371 --> 21:06.106
to your herpes problem,
Caroline.

21:06.107 --> 21:08.809
Just don't tell anyone!

21:08.810 --> 21:10.711
Sophie,
I don't have it.
