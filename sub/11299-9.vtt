<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies...

00:09.883 --> 00:11.116
I know you
got a day job,

00:11.151 --> 00:12.450
but I'd like for you
to advise the campaign.

00:12.486 --> 00:14.219
I represent the Kohl brothers.

00:14.254 --> 00:15.220
Cha-ching.

00:15.255 --> 00:16.421
<i>We could be there</i>

00:16.456 --> 00:18.590
- <i>for Phoebe in a very real way.</i>
- Fuck yeah.

00:18.625 --> 00:19.791
<i>Assuming your ex-wife</i>

00:19.826 --> 00:21.493
- doesn't win the offer first.
- Correct.

00:21.528 --> 00:23.595
We're gonna blow her
right out of the water.

00:23.630 --> 00:24.930
We screw people over
all the time,

00:24.965 --> 00:26.331
but if we're just gonna
hand the whole thing

00:26.366 --> 00:27.732
over to Skip Galweather,

00:27.768 --> 00:28.833
what's the point?

00:28.869 --> 00:31.136
The point is money, Jeannie.

00:31.171 --> 00:32.570
Skip just called,

00:32.606 --> 00:34.639
and the Kohl brothers
are going with Monica.

00:34.675 --> 00:36.007
Until they sign
on that dotted line,

00:36.043 --> 00:37.175
we can still win this thing.

00:37.210 --> 00:39.444
You still have
a connection in Cuba, right?

00:39.479 --> 00:40.812
I don't know if Cuba's
ready for the Kohl brothers.

00:40.847 --> 00:42.314
Let's make 'em ready.

You're creeping me out.
What's up?

01:27.027 --> 01:28.627
Seth Buckley
is leading the polls,

01:28.662 --> 01:30.328
and by extension...

01:30.364 --> 01:31.229
Your penis?

01:31.264 --> 01:32.397
- My penis.
- What a shock.

01:32.432 --> 01:33.798
Slapping around that boy band

01:33.834 --> 01:36.301
has turned Seth into
a social media sensation.

01:37.437 --> 01:38.870
Can I give you a little
word of advice, Clyde?

01:38.905 --> 01:41.039
I really came in here to gloat.
I don't care about your advice.

01:41.074 --> 01:43.074
- Proceed with caution, my friend.
- Okay.

01:43.110 --> 01:44.909
Social media can be
a fickle mistress.

01:44.945 --> 01:46.511
- Mm-hmm.
- One minute, you're being called

01:46.546 --> 01:48.146
the King of the TED Talk,

01:48.181 --> 01:50.949
and the next, VagBreath69

01:50.984 --> 01:51.850
is telling you to

01:51.885 --> 01:53.251
"choke on a druid's cock."

01:53.286 --> 01:56.021
This is the exact type
of break we needed.

01:56.056 --> 01:57.922
See, people are taking
a closer look at him.

01:57.958 --> 02:00.458
Seth Buckley is going
to be the new mayor.

02:00.494 --> 02:03.061
And VagBreath69
is going to be his chief

02:03.096 --> 02:04.462
economic advisor.

02:04.498 --> 02:06.231
Fucking knew
it was you. Marty!

02:06.266 --> 02:07.866
Clyde's been saying mean things
about me on social media again.

02:07.901 --> 02:08.833
I have.

02:08.869 --> 02:09.734
Aw.

02:09.770 --> 02:11.636
Isn't this nice?

02:11.672 --> 02:13.972
Couple of co-workers just
easing into their morning.

02:14.007 --> 02:15.073
Yeah.

02:15.108 --> 02:16.408
Maybe reading an
online article or two.

02:16.443 --> 02:17.909
Sippin' a nice
cup of joe.

02:17.944 --> 02:19.544
You know what? I've actually
recently switched to tea,

02:19.579 --> 02:21.546
and I got to say,
digestively speaking...

02:21.581 --> 02:23.048
Pretty certain we're about
to get yelled at, Douglas.

02:23.083 --> 02:24.115
What the fuck
is wrong with you guys?

02:24.151 --> 02:25.116
Should I move away from you?

02:25.152 --> 02:26.284
- If you cherish your life.
- Yeah.

02:26.319 --> 02:27.552
- Of course. I apologize.
- Why haven't I gotten

02:27.587 --> 02:29.421
the PowerPoint
on the fucking Cuba pitch?

02:29.456 --> 02:31.589
- I e-mailed it to you yesterday.
- Well, I haven't gotten it.

02:31.625 --> 02:32.924
'Cause the Internet
in this building is fucked.

02:32.959 --> 02:35.126
- Doug...
- I-I'm on it, Marty.

02:35.162 --> 02:36.261
I've e-mailed I. T.
a bunch of times,

02:36.296 --> 02:37.395
I haven't heard anything...

02:37.431 --> 02:38.596
E-mailed.

02:38.632 --> 02:40.765
Where's my head? I'll call them.

02:40.801 --> 02:42.333
In the meantime, I guess,
I'll just go sit in my office

02:42.369 --> 02:43.835
in front of the computer
and wait for the thing.

02:43.870 --> 02:44.969
All right. We'll be in touch.

02:45.005 --> 02:45.904
Wow, you don't
see it coming again?

02:45.939 --> 02:46.938
Or you dickheads

02:46.973 --> 02:48.073
could pitch it to me

02:48.108 --> 02:49.407
right the fuck now!

02:49.443 --> 02:50.408
Cuba strategy
for the Kohl brothers.

02:50.444 --> 02:51.409
Let me hear it.

02:51.445 --> 02:52.410
With the trade ban lifted,

02:52.446 --> 02:53.712
demand for hotel inventory

02:53.747 --> 02:55.213
is about to shoot through
the motherfucking roof.

02:55.248 --> 02:58.483
That's 1.5 million
American visitors per year,

02:58.518 --> 02:59.751
trying to fit into
60, 000 hotel rooms.

02:59.786 --> 03:02.420
Yeah, resort development
is the tip of the spear.

03:02.456 --> 03:05.356
Okay? If they can establish
a foothold in Cuba,

03:05.392 --> 03:07.325
the Kohl brothers can
extend their tentacles

03:07.360 --> 03:08.493
into many arenas,
such as...

03:08.528 --> 03:09.494
Agriculture,

03:09.529 --> 03:10.628
energy, polymers
and paper.

03:10.664 --> 03:11.963
A vast,

03:11.998 --> 03:13.865
untamed frontier, just
off the coast of Florida.

03:13.900 --> 03:15.467
Kohl brothers are gonna
eat this shit up.

03:15.502 --> 03:17.001
Now, the tricky part is gonna be

03:17.037 --> 03:18.770
navigating Cuban bureaucracy,
but Ron Zobel's

03:18.805 --> 03:20.472
- got that covered, right?
- He better.

03:21.608 --> 03:23.508
Hey.

03:23.543 --> 03:25.176
So guess who called in
sick again?

03:25.212 --> 03:26.511
Fucking nanny.

03:26.546 --> 03:27.645
<i>Did she do the whole, like,</i>

03:27.681 --> 03:28.980
<i>voice with the cough, like...</i>

03:30.183 --> 03:31.683
"Oh, I don't want
to get Phoebe sick."

03:31.718 --> 03:33.184
No, she went with stomach flu.

03:33.220 --> 03:35.620
<i>I think she knows
we're hip to the fake cold.</i>

03:35.655 --> 03:37.355
Is that Jeannie?
Hello, Jeannie.

03:37.390 --> 03:38.857
Yeah, Ron Zobel says hi.

03:38.892 --> 03:39.858
<i>Yeah, I heard.</i>

03:39.893 --> 03:41.025
<i>So I checked around</i>

03:41.061 --> 03:43.128
and I got no hits
on a replacement sitter.

03:43.163 --> 03:45.497
I think I'm just gonna
take a mommy-daughter day.

03:45.532 --> 03:46.564
Yeah, that sounds good.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.333
Uh, give Phoebe
a kiss for me, okay?

03:48.368 --> 03:50.301
You do the same with Ron Zobel.

03:51.805 --> 03:53.772
Ron. Just the man
I was looking for.

03:53.807 --> 03:55.707
Oh, you want me to double
my output of PSLs?

03:55.742 --> 03:56.441
PSLs?

03:56.476 --> 03:57.675
Pumpkin spice lattes.

03:57.711 --> 03:58.777
No.

03:58.812 --> 04:00.044
Uh, I'm good there.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.013
Listen, I was wondering
about your Cuba contact.

04:02.048 --> 04:03.081
- Mm-hmm.
- Has he been able

04:03.116 --> 04:04.149
to arrange a sit-down?

04:04.184 --> 04:05.517
Yeah, one second,
because, you know,

04:05.552 --> 04:06.918
this requires focus,

04:06.953 --> 04:09.120
and you do not want
to over-cinnamon, Martin.

04:09.156 --> 04:11.489
God, no.

04:11.525 --> 04:12.524
So, Ron?

04:13.727 --> 04:15.660
Yeah, Orozco and I
have already had

04:15.695 --> 04:16.995
our preliminary
discussions.

04:17.029 --> 04:18.897
Man, you really
need to taste this.

04:18.932 --> 04:20.231
I don't want
a fucking latte.

04:20.267 --> 04:21.632
Because if you've
only ever had

04:21.668 --> 04:22.867
the kind from Starbucks,
man...

04:22.903 --> 04:25.670
Ron, just how preliminary
have these discussions been?

04:25.705 --> 04:27.672
Yeah. I have not
broached the topic

04:27.707 --> 04:29.174
of K and A's
interest in Cuba.

04:30.210 --> 04:31.176
Great.

04:31.211 --> 04:32.177
I mean, no sweat.

04:32.212 --> 04:33.378
Not like there's a ticking clock

04:33.413 --> 04:34.512
on this fucking thing.

04:34.548 --> 04:35.947
Listen, I know
you're looking

04:35.982 --> 04:38.216
to get Skip's dick hard
about Cuba ASAP.

04:38.251 --> 04:41.252
But listen to me, I have put
major time and resources

04:41.288 --> 04:43.755
into cultivating Orozco,
predating my employment here.

04:43.790 --> 04:45.023
You hedgey motherfucker.

04:45.058 --> 04:46.357
Come on.
I mean, obviously,

04:46.393 --> 04:48.993
I know it'll be a huge win
if we can parlay Cuba

04:49.029 --> 04:50.662
into an offer from the Kohls
to buy K and A.

04:50.697 --> 04:53.097
Yeah. Because you'd be sitting
in the captain's chair, right?

04:53.133 --> 04:54.966
If the sale goes through.

04:55.001 --> 04:57.068
But if not,
I need some guarantee.

04:57.103 --> 05:00.872
Um, how about I guarantee I will
stomp a mud hole in your ass

05:00.907 --> 05:03.441
if you don't get this guy
on the phone right fucking now.

05:03.476 --> 05:05.210
Is that the kind of guarantee
you're looking for, Ron?

05:05.245 --> 05:07.212
I was thinking more like
a larger equity piece.

05:07.247 --> 05:08.613
I fucking swear...

05:08.648 --> 05:10.248
You know I've been
a good soldier.

05:10.283 --> 05:12.417
Okay? And I've eaten
a lot of shit from you.

05:12.452 --> 05:14.586
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:14.621 --> 05:16.654
But don't confuse me
with being a patsy.

05:16.690 --> 05:17.989
Do you understand?

05:18.024 --> 05:21.459
Cuba moves forward
on my terms

05:21.494 --> 05:24.362
or not at all.

05:24.397 --> 05:26.197
We clear?

05:26.233 --> 05:28.633
<i>Don't forget to breathe.
That's the way.</i>

05:29.936 --> 05:33.304
<i>Five, four, three, two,</i>

05:33.340 --> 05:34.739
<i>one.</i>

05:34.774 --> 05:36.708
<i>Right back into
standing crunches.</i>

05:36.743 --> 05:39.110
<i>Five, four, three,</i>

05:39.145 --> 05:41.846
<i>two, one. Almost there.</i>

05:41.882 --> 05:43.147
- Ha, yeah, Phoebe.
- <i>Two more left.</i>

05:43.183 --> 05:44.616
Work those baby abs.

05:44.651 --> 05:46.584
<i>Here we go. Five, four...</i>

05:46.620 --> 05:50.488
No, you absolutely do not
spark joy, dress. No.

05:50.523 --> 05:52.624
No. No.

05:52.659 --> 05:55.560
No.

06:32.766 --> 06:36.301
Oh! Ow.

06:39.072 --> 06:41.272
"What does your
favorite ice cream say

06:41.308 --> 06:43.041
about your sexual prowess?"

06:43.076 --> 06:45.109
Give me a break.

06:45.145 --> 06:46.611
There's a fly in here.

06:46.646 --> 06:48.146
Phoebe, there's a fly!

06:48.181 --> 06:50.648
How does Rocky Road
make me a wet noodle?

06:50.684 --> 06:52.116
Phoebe.

06:52.152 --> 06:53.818
Phoebe...

06:58.491 --> 06:59.624
Wake up.

07:01.161 --> 07:02.694
Wake up, you lazy bum.

07:02.729 --> 07:04.062
Phoebe, Phoebe,
Phoebe, Phoebe.

07:12.005 --> 07:14.138
Are you fucking kidding me?

07:15.475 --> 07:16.674
<i>Okay, well...</i>

07:16.710 --> 07:19.143
we dropped Mommy's stuff
off at the dry cleaner.

07:19.179 --> 07:21.179
We got you shoes.

07:22.882 --> 07:24.882
Where should we go now?

07:26.252 --> 07:28.219
I asked you
a question, young lady.

07:28.254 --> 07:30.054
Oh, well, if that's

07:30.090 --> 07:32.290
your attitude,
I guess we won't go anywhere.

07:35.061 --> 07:36.494
What did you say?

07:36.529 --> 07:38.329
"I said
I think you should go to a bar

07:38.365 --> 07:40.264
and drink until you pass out."

07:40.300 --> 07:41.933
Phoebe!

07:41.968 --> 07:44.769
That's horribly irresponsible.

07:44.804 --> 07:46.170
It's not even noon.

07:46.206 --> 07:49.607
"Don't be so locked
into societal conventions."

07:49.642 --> 07:51.676
I am not locked in.

07:51.711 --> 07:53.344
"I dare you."

07:53.380 --> 07:56.347
Oh, you dare me, do you?

07:56.383 --> 07:57.515
What...?

07:57.550 --> 07:58.549
Are you leaving?

07:58.585 --> 08:00.718
Yeah. Yes.
Yes. Sorry.

08:02.989 --> 08:04.122
Shit.

08:04.157 --> 08:06.057
You got a gnarly piece
of malware here.

08:06.092 --> 08:07.058
This is impressive.

08:07.093 --> 08:08.259
Mm-hmm. Can you fix it?

08:08.294 --> 08:09.460
That's above my pay grade.

08:09.496 --> 08:10.862
You got to call
Cisco Security.

08:10.897 --> 08:12.430
You got to be kidding.
So coming down here

08:12.465 --> 08:13.631
was a complete waste of my time.

08:13.666 --> 08:15.066
- Great.
- Well, I can tell you

08:15.101 --> 08:17.602
the infection point is
a computer registered to

08:17.637 --> 08:18.870
a Douglas Guggenheim.

08:18.905 --> 08:20.204
That's you, right?

08:20.240 --> 08:22.206
- What?
- You know, they're not

08:22.242 --> 08:24.242
sending those sexy pics
to you personally.

08:24.277 --> 08:26.377
Uh... yeah. No, I know that.
That's...

08:26.413 --> 08:28.646
Tho-Those, actually,
those are from Marceline,

08:28.681 --> 08:31.115
and I knew a Marceline
from college... uh, Harvard...

08:31.151 --> 08:32.984
and I always thought there
was kind of an unresolved

08:33.019 --> 08:34.652
sexual tension
between us.

08:34.687 --> 08:35.787
What's the backstory

08:35.822 --> 08:37.321
on you clicking on
"Quick Snatch Alert"?

08:37.357 --> 08:38.389
What the fuck?

08:38.424 --> 08:39.390
Don't sweat it, man.

08:39.426 --> 08:41.058
You're into sex. That's cool.

08:42.261 --> 08:43.227
Yeah?

08:43.263 --> 08:44.328
Douche bag.

08:44.364 --> 08:46.064
And the pediatrician said

08:46.099 --> 08:47.465
that she'd be happy
if he never had

08:47.500 --> 08:48.933
a glass of juice in his life.

08:48.968 --> 08:50.635
Which is funny.

08:50.670 --> 08:54.439
When we were kids, I feel like
all we did was drink juice.

08:54.474 --> 08:57.675
Like, I grew up on
apple juice and orange juice.

08:57.710 --> 08:59.977
Do you remember that,
like, concentrated

09:00.013 --> 09:03.915
can of orange juice
you could just mix with water?

09:03.950 --> 09:05.450
And it was fine for our parents.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.466
Marty,

09:21.501 --> 09:23.367
what a lovely surprise.

09:23.403 --> 09:24.769
How's work?
How are the kids?

09:24.804 --> 09:26.771
Listen, I need for you
to arrange a meeting

09:26.806 --> 09:27.972
for me with the Kohl brothers.

09:28.007 --> 09:29.540
- Getting right down to it, huh?
- Yeah.

09:29.576 --> 09:31.542
I know that your guys are
all about untapped markets.

09:31.578 --> 09:34.112
Hey, Marty, did you ever
watch <i>Gilligan's Island?</i>

09:34.147 --> 09:37.048
Did I ever watch
<i>Gilligan's Island?</i> What?

09:37.083 --> 09:38.216
Man, I loved that show.

09:38.251 --> 09:40.218
There was this one episode

09:40.253 --> 09:42.453
where this Japanese sailor
gets washed up onshore.

09:42.489 --> 09:45.456
He was played by this
white actor.

09:45.492 --> 09:48.226
Coke-bottle glasses
and "ching chong" accent.

09:48.261 --> 09:49.560
- Oh.
- Super racist.

09:49.596 --> 09:51.629
- Yeah, hilarious.
- Uh, well, anyway,

09:51.664 --> 09:54.632
he imprisons the castaways
because, get this,

09:54.667 --> 09:57.068
he still thinks
it's World War Two.

09:58.705 --> 10:02.340
It's 1965; the war's
been over for 20 years!

10:02.375 --> 10:04.809
- Nobody told the guy. Yeah.
- Nobody told the guy.

10:04.844 --> 10:07.345
Take off the Coke-bottle
glasses, Hirohito.

10:07.380 --> 10:08.679
War's over.

10:08.715 --> 10:10.681
You lost, move on.

10:10.717 --> 10:12.350
When the Kohl brothers hear
what I have to pitch,

10:12.385 --> 10:14.152
- they're gonna be all over it.
- No, no, no, no.

10:14.187 --> 10:15.820
You're not quite getting it.
I'm gonna speak slowly.

10:15.855 --> 10:18.523
This was never
a real competition.

10:18.558 --> 10:21.526
So whatever "Hail Marty"
you're planning on throwing,

10:21.561 --> 10:24.061
don't bother, because it won't
change a goddamn thing.

10:24.097 --> 10:27.398
Why? Because I've got my thumb...
boom... on the scale,

10:27.433 --> 10:30.101
and... I don't want you to win.

10:30.136 --> 10:33.437
So all that sweet talking you
were doing at the beginning,

10:33.473 --> 10:34.505
that was just bullshit?

10:34.541 --> 10:35.840
Well, no.

10:35.875 --> 10:37.775
But then you actually
started to want it,

10:37.810 --> 10:40.178
and I couldn't resist
picking up that football.

10:40.213 --> 10:43.014
I'm Charlie Brown?
I'm Charlie Brown?

10:43.049 --> 10:45.683
Ah, yeah. Ha, ha, ha.

10:45.718 --> 10:49.020
Okay, well, it's always a
pleasure to see you, Skip.

10:49.055 --> 10:51.022
I will send you
a box of cigars

10:51.057 --> 10:54.692
when I am building hotels
with Marriott in Cuba.

10:54.727 --> 10:55.726
Wait, what?

10:55.762 --> 10:57.061
"Wait, what?"

10:57.096 --> 10:59.297
Huh? That got your fucking
attention, didn't it?

10:59.332 --> 11:02.767
That's right, Uncle Marty has
a plan that is gonna make

11:02.802 --> 11:04.969
the Kohl brothers' <i>Havana Nights</i>
wet dream a reality.

11:05.004 --> 11:06.971
Holy shit.

11:07.006 --> 11:10.141
Cuba, that's, like,
a billion-dollar opportunity.

11:10.176 --> 11:13.144
I serve that up to the Kohls,
they'll lift me up on my back

11:13.179 --> 11:15.947
and parade me
through the streets!

11:15.982 --> 11:19.083
Viva la Galweather, baby!

11:19.118 --> 11:22.420
Monica already brought us
Cuba this morning, slowpoke.

11:22.455 --> 11:25.056
Oh, shit, did I yank away
that football again?

11:25.091 --> 11:27.725
She's actually got
a very smart plan,

11:27.760 --> 11:30.061
centering around
resort development.

11:30.096 --> 11:32.063
Once they have established
a toehold in Cuba,

11:32.098 --> 11:33.397
the Kohl brothers
can spread

11:33.433 --> 11:35.233
their many tentacles
into other arenas.

11:35.268 --> 11:40.104
Agriculture, energy,
polymers and paper.

11:55.321 --> 11:57.955
We'll look at
the file trajectory,

11:57.991 --> 11:59.957
determine the extent
of the malware compromise.

11:59.993 --> 12:01.292
Hey, how's it going?

12:01.327 --> 12:02.960
- Hey, guys. How you doing?
- Hi.

12:02.996 --> 12:04.629
All right, listen,
if anyone asks,

12:04.664 --> 12:06.297
you're my cousin Edgar
from out of town, okay?

12:06.332 --> 12:07.632
What? Why?

12:07.667 --> 12:09.166
Because I said so, Edgar.

12:09.202 --> 12:10.201
Jesus.

12:11.571 --> 12:13.137
Oh, hey! Holy shit.

12:13.172 --> 12:15.306
I didn't, uh, think
you'd be here.

12:15.341 --> 12:16.941
I thought you were
eating out today, JR.

12:16.976 --> 12:17.942
No? Good. Great.

12:17.977 --> 12:19.377
Great, great, great to see you.

12:19.412 --> 12:22.113
This is
JR, my office mate,

12:22.148 --> 12:23.547
my pal, my mentee.

12:23.583 --> 12:25.683
- Not your mentee, Doug.
- Well, doesn't matter.

12:25.718 --> 12:27.718
Uh, JR, this is
my cousin Edgar.

12:27.754 --> 12:30.221
Um, Edgar grew up a couple
towns over from me.

12:30.256 --> 12:31.956
Spent our formative
years together.

12:31.991 --> 12:33.824
Even lost our virginity
to the same girl.

12:33.860 --> 12:35.459
Can you imagine?

12:35.495 --> 12:36.560
What was her name again?

12:36.596 --> 12:38.162
I don't remember.

12:39.332 --> 12:41.565
You don't remember.

12:41.601 --> 12:42.533
Classic Edgar.

12:42.568 --> 12:43.901
Can I get on this computer?

12:43.936 --> 12:46.237
Yeah. Oh, God, listen to him.

12:46.272 --> 12:48.906
Straight off the plane,
already has to check Facebook.

12:48.941 --> 12:50.875
This guy, always with
the status updates, huh?

12:50.910 --> 12:51.876
Sorry.

12:51.911 --> 12:53.577
- All right.
- Nice meeting you.

12:57.583 --> 12:59.550
You don't remember
her name?

12:59.585 --> 13:01.652
Get your head
in the game, Edgar.

13:32.218 --> 13:33.184
Yeah!

13:37.890 --> 13:40.024
Okay, I like
where your head's at.

13:40.059 --> 13:41.359
Oh.

13:47.166 --> 13:48.099
Guys. Guys.

13:48.134 --> 13:49.033
Yeah.

13:49.068 --> 13:50.368
What the fuck
are you doing?

13:50.403 --> 13:51.769
Oh, yeah,
what are we doing?

13:51.804 --> 13:53.604
It seems that Ron
hedged his bets

13:53.639 --> 13:56.107
and gave Monica
our plan on Cuba.

13:56.142 --> 13:59.110
So we are taking the measured
response of trashing his office

13:59.145 --> 14:01.112
before we do the
very same to him.

14:02.615 --> 14:04.315
Marty, that... that
doesn't make any sense.

14:04.350 --> 14:05.816
Jeannie, if you're
gonna try to stop us,

14:05.852 --> 14:09.153
you should keep in mind it is
twice as much fun as it looks.

14:09.188 --> 14:10.254
Marty, Marty.

14:10.289 --> 14:13.424
Marty, Ron gave you
the keys to Cuba, right?

14:13.459 --> 14:15.826
So... why would he do that
if he's just gonna turn around

14:15.862 --> 14:16.827
and give them to Monica?

14:16.863 --> 14:18.829
I do not fucking know, Jeannie.

14:18.865 --> 14:21.499
But what I know is that
Skip fucking Galweather

14:21.534 --> 14:25.102
had details about Monica's plan
that matched ours exactly.

14:25.138 --> 14:27.104
So if you don't mind...

14:27.140 --> 14:28.172
- Ha!
- No, no, no, no!

14:28.207 --> 14:29.907
- God.
- Um...

14:29.942 --> 14:32.243
Okay, look, I don't know
if any of you heard

14:32.278 --> 14:34.812
that my cousin Edgar is
visiting from out of town.

14:34.847 --> 14:36.447
Truth is...

14:37.483 --> 14:39.083
...he's not really my cousin.

14:39.118 --> 14:40.918
Yeah, I know that, Doug.

14:40.953 --> 14:42.086
Well, sure,
now that I told you.

14:42.121 --> 14:43.087
Are you serious? No.

14:43.122 --> 14:44.155
Hey, Doug?

14:44.190 --> 14:45.823
I think I might know

14:45.858 --> 14:47.992
how Monica figured
out our plan.

14:48.027 --> 14:49.527
Okay, your server was
definitely compromised.

14:49.562 --> 14:51.662
Jesus, Doug.

14:51.697 --> 14:54.265
Of all the ways you could have
fucked over this company...

14:54.300 --> 14:56.300
This is by far
the least surprising.

14:56.335 --> 14:57.968
Hey, let's not forget

14:58.004 --> 14:59.870
who brought Monica into
our lives in the first place.

15:02.141 --> 15:05.142
I mean, fucking Monica, right?

15:05.178 --> 15:07.711
So I'll run AMP to remove
the malicious files.

15:07.747 --> 15:10.047
No, no, wait, hold on,
don't... don't do anything.

15:10.082 --> 15:12.883
Just, um, leave it
in place for now.

15:12.919 --> 15:14.552
Monica can still
read our e-mails.

15:14.587 --> 15:15.653
Correct.

15:15.688 --> 15:17.655
Which is something you could
use to your advantage

15:17.690 --> 15:19.657
since she doesn't
know you know.

15:19.692 --> 15:21.659
Would you ever consider
coming to work here, Bruce?

15:21.694 --> 15:23.227
I mean, we're gonna
have an opening soon.

15:23.262 --> 15:25.229
No, we're not.

15:25.264 --> 15:26.564
He's joking. He's kidding.

15:26.599 --> 15:28.899
No, I-I... I understand
how difficult it was

15:28.935 --> 15:30.234
for you to wrangle
this meeting,

15:30.269 --> 15:32.736
and I-I appreciate it,
but I'm not gonna call...

15:32.772 --> 15:34.972
I'm not gonna say it. Um...

15:36.275 --> 15:37.475
You're the magic man.

15:37.510 --> 15:39.477
Okay? Yep, there you go.

15:39.512 --> 15:41.145
Bye-bye.

15:41.180 --> 15:43.180
Um, was that the magic man?

15:43.216 --> 15:46.183
Seems that Ron was able
to get us five minutes

15:46.219 --> 15:48.352
- with the Kohl brothers.
- What did you have to give up?

15:48.387 --> 15:50.521
You haven't grown too attached
to Phoebe, have you?

15:50.556 --> 15:52.923
For five minutes with
the Kohls? Phoebe who?

15:53.793 --> 15:55.059
Right?

16:00.066 --> 16:01.732
Oh, hey, Dad. Hey, Jeannie.

16:03.870 --> 16:05.836
- What was that?
- What was what?

16:05.872 --> 16:09.607
Okay, y'all were
watching some porn. Okay.

16:09.642 --> 16:12.009
You were supposed to be home
an hour ago, you realize that?

16:12.044 --> 16:14.678
You know what, go do
your homework, okay?

16:14.714 --> 16:16.380
Go on.

16:16.415 --> 16:18.082
I'll go do my homework.

16:19.752 --> 16:22.052
- Good night, Roscoe.
- You got it, Mr. Kaan.

16:22.088 --> 16:23.687
I got you.
Good night, Jeannie.

16:27.093 --> 16:28.559
Good, good.

16:28.594 --> 16:31.562
It did not come off
insanely paranoid.

16:31.597 --> 16:33.564
Listen, Monica hacked
into our server, okay?

16:33.599 --> 16:34.899
You think she's above
pumping her own kid

16:34.934 --> 16:36.967
for some insider information?

16:38.504 --> 16:40.371
Phoebe and I had
a pretty interesting day.

16:40.406 --> 16:41.372
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

16:41.407 --> 16:42.706
We went to the park.

16:42.742 --> 16:44.375
And we saw
this old man,

16:44.410 --> 16:47.878
who was, uh, in
this amazing suit.

16:47.914 --> 16:49.547
Like, a pin-striped.

16:49.582 --> 16:51.415
Like, Yves
Saint Laurent.

16:51.450 --> 16:53.117
I don't know, I felt like
he must have been,

16:53.152 --> 16:55.119
uh, a dynamo in '73.

16:55.154 --> 16:56.453
And he...

16:56.489 --> 16:59.123
it was like he got all
dressed up to go to work,

16:59.158 --> 17:02.159
and there was just
no work to go to,

17:02.194 --> 17:04.929
so he... he sat down
and fed the pigeons.

17:04.964 --> 17:07.263
It's actually
kind of sad.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.900
Not for the pigeons.

17:11.604 --> 17:14.238
Not for the pigeons.

17:14.272 --> 17:16.073
Jeannie, we're not 83.

17:16.108 --> 17:17.575
- I know.
- And if it gets to the point

17:17.609 --> 17:19.242
where, you know,
we're buying birdseed...

17:19.278 --> 17:20.877
Obviously, it's not
gonna get to the point

17:20.913 --> 17:23.580
where we're buying
birdseed, but I just...

17:23.616 --> 17:26.250
you know, we've never had
that kind of time before.

17:26.285 --> 17:28.786
We get bored,
we'll just go back to work.

17:28.821 --> 17:31.121
Is that what you're
planning on doing?

17:31.157 --> 17:32.790
Because I thought
the whole point was

17:32.825 --> 17:35.793
that-that... that we're not
supposed to jump right back in.

17:35.828 --> 17:37.595
Okay, then we don't.

17:39.298 --> 17:41.265
That...

17:41.300 --> 17:43.133
Okay. Great.

17:44.837 --> 17:46.170
Great.

17:52.211 --> 17:54.178
So when would
we be going?

17:54.213 --> 17:55.679
And how long will
we be there?

17:55.715 --> 17:57.014
It's supposed
to rain early next week;

17:57.049 --> 17:58.015
should I be packing
an umbrella?

17:58.050 --> 17:59.350
I don't know, Douglas.

17:59.385 --> 18:01.619
If it rains, you can always
buy an umbrella in Cuba.

18:01.654 --> 18:03.954
Can I? Uh, it's
a communist country.

18:03.990 --> 18:05.289
Are umbrellas even available?

18:05.324 --> 18:06.624
You know I can't think
when I'm wet.

18:06.659 --> 18:08.125
By the way, if you guys
are going this week,

18:08.160 --> 18:09.293
I will be joining late.

18:09.328 --> 18:10.628
Campaign has a lot
of big meetings

18:10.663 --> 18:11.962
about the shape
of the administration,

18:11.998 --> 18:13.063
and Seth is gonna
want my input.

18:13.099 --> 18:14.398
Oh, well, if you're not going,

18:14.433 --> 18:16.333
maybe we should just
skip the whole Cuba thing.

18:16.369 --> 18:17.701
Yeah, you know what?

18:17.737 --> 18:19.303
Let's just cancel the Kohl
brothers meeting, too.

18:19.338 --> 18:21.071
Actually, Marty,
you better call Monica,

18:21.107 --> 18:22.473
tell her we surrender.

18:22.508 --> 18:24.108
You know what, fuck,
before I forget.

18:24.143 --> 18:26.243
'Cause we have to be so careful
about our e-mail and everything,

18:26.278 --> 18:28.579
I want to deliver this
the old-fashioned way.

18:28.614 --> 18:30.347
Douglas, for you.

18:30.383 --> 18:32.916
Oh, my God,
is that a snatch alert?

18:32.952 --> 18:34.485
Very funny, Clyde.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.853
- Very funny.
- Mm.

18:35.888 --> 18:37.755
Boy, you really want to open
that thing, don't you?

18:37.790 --> 18:38.956
- Huh?
- What is wrong with you?

18:38.991 --> 18:41.058
I'm not saying it definitely is,

18:41.093 --> 18:43.127
but there's a possibility
that is an actual snatch alert.

18:44.296 --> 18:45.963
Okay, you know what?

18:45.998 --> 18:47.631
I'm gonna put this exactly
where it belongs.

18:47.667 --> 18:50.601
Right here in the, uh...

18:50.636 --> 18:52.136
in the trash there.

18:52.171 --> 18:53.237
Right there, yeah.

18:53.272 --> 18:54.838
Okay... Oh.
You know what?

18:54.874 --> 18:57.441
I'll, um, I'll meet you
downstairs. I forgot to...

18:57.476 --> 18:58.876
Your snatch alert?

18:58.911 --> 19:00.310
Uh, oh, no, no, no!

19:08.120 --> 19:11.055
Last meeting didn't
go as expected?

19:11.090 --> 19:13.057
When I was eight
and Sean was nine,

19:13.092 --> 19:14.458
our father locked us
in our room.

19:14.493 --> 19:16.994
Told us there was
only one candy bar.

19:17.029 --> 19:18.128
Said whichever
one of us

19:18.164 --> 19:19.997
was still standing
in an hour got it.

19:20.032 --> 19:21.765
What kind of candy bar?
Doesn't matter.

19:21.801 --> 19:23.233
We did that every night
for a year.

19:23.269 --> 19:24.735
That's a lot of candy.

19:24.770 --> 19:26.136
Stop talking, Doug.

19:26.172 --> 19:27.471
Humans are animals.

19:27.506 --> 19:28.839
World is a jungle.

19:28.874 --> 19:31.108
Our father wanted us
to understand that.

19:31.143 --> 19:32.609
We're not sitting here today
if not for him.

19:32.645 --> 19:33.577
Great man.

19:33.612 --> 19:34.912
- Oh, yeah.
- Great man.

19:34.947 --> 19:36.613
You can tell from that
story that he sounds cool.

19:36.649 --> 19:38.082
What's he up to?

19:38.117 --> 19:39.516
We're vigilant about
not forgetting that lesson.

19:39.552 --> 19:41.852
That's why you still beat
the shit out of each other.

19:41.887 --> 19:43.187
It's always nice to hold on
to a piece of your childhood.

19:43.222 --> 19:45.289
Are we done bullshitting?

19:45.324 --> 19:46.457
Thought we were
talking about Cuba.

19:46.492 --> 19:47.658
We are. May we?

19:50.596 --> 19:54.298
Now, we understand that
Monica Talbot made you a lot

19:54.333 --> 19:57.701
of big promises, but she
doesn't have what we have.

19:57.737 --> 20:00.003
An actual Cuban contact.

20:00.039 --> 20:01.872
Excuse me.

20:01.907 --> 20:04.274
I'm so sorry, Marty.

20:04.310 --> 20:05.676
Am I interrupting?

20:05.711 --> 20:07.044
Marty, did you think

20:07.079 --> 20:09.012
I wasn't gonna find out?
What is this?

20:09.048 --> 20:10.147
A little end-around?

20:10.182 --> 20:11.682
Little League. Excuse me.

20:11.717 --> 20:13.784
I'm so sorry.
I apologize.

20:13.819 --> 20:15.519
I told him it was over.

20:15.554 --> 20:17.054
Did you tell them why?

20:17.089 --> 20:18.222
You know,
why you insisted

20:18.257 --> 20:20.357
on them spending
$100 million dollars

20:20.392 --> 20:22.626
to buy Talbot &amp; Company
as opposed to us?

20:22.661 --> 20:24.328
You didn't tell them?

20:24.363 --> 20:26.663
That's fine. I'll take
care of it, Skipper.

20:26.699 --> 20:29.133
You see, Skip thinks
I'm an asshole.

20:29.168 --> 20:31.969
And Skip is right.
He is.

20:32.004 --> 20:33.303
Playing with
other people's money

20:33.339 --> 20:35.205
just to pursue
a personal vendetta?

20:35.241 --> 20:36.173
It's not cool, Skip.

20:36.208 --> 20:38.041
Ain't cool, Skip.

20:38.077 --> 20:39.476
You see, he doesn't
really believe

20:39.512 --> 20:40.711
that Monica
is the smarter play.

20:40.746 --> 20:42.312
He's just upset

20:42.348 --> 20:45.516
because, a long time ago,
I hurt his little feelings.

20:45.551 --> 20:47.985
I chose Monica...

20:48.020 --> 20:49.987
- You're a fucking pussy.
- That's the word, yes.

20:50.022 --> 20:51.722
I've been saying that
for years, thank you.

20:51.757 --> 20:53.190
I am not a pussy.

20:53.225 --> 20:54.825
Look, I don't give
a shit about you.

20:54.860 --> 20:56.660
And I don't give a shit

20:56.695 --> 20:58.896
about the skinny girl
with the whisper voice.

20:59.932 --> 21:00.898
That's Monica.

21:00.933 --> 21:02.833
I do give a shit

21:02.868 --> 21:04.201
about Cuba.

21:04.236 --> 21:07.104
Our grandfather had
substantial holdings there.

21:07.139 --> 21:09.373
All repatriated
after the revolution.

21:09.408 --> 21:11.742
Fucking communists
stole our birthright.

21:11.777 --> 21:13.377
We're gonna take back
what's ours.

21:13.412 --> 21:16.246
For Paw-Paw.

21:16.282 --> 21:17.915
For Paw-Paw.

21:17.950 --> 21:19.216
For Paw-Paw.

21:19.251 --> 21:20.017
For Paw-Paw!

21:23.622 --> 21:25.355
Whichever firm
has the balls

21:25.391 --> 21:28.559
and the brains to help
us make that happen...

21:30.429 --> 21:31.795
...that's who we buy.

21:51.283 --> 21:52.583
This is great.
This is great.

21:52.618 --> 21:53.917
Actually, but
I just need you to shorten it.

21:53.953 --> 21:55.619
So shorten it.
Shorter is always better.

21:55.654 --> 21:57.521
- Oh, there he is!
- Hey.

21:57.556 --> 21:58.856
Next mayor of Los Angeles.

21:58.891 --> 22:00.057
Hey, fingers crossed.

22:00.092 --> 22:01.792
Hey, I'll meet you guys
inside, okay?

22:01.827 --> 22:03.160
You what what I can't
wait to do?

22:03.195 --> 22:04.695
- Huh?
- Trade in my boring old scissors

22:04.730 --> 22:06.196
for those giant
ribbon-cutting ones?

22:06.232 --> 22:07.464
- Yes.
- You know what I'm talking about?

22:07.499 --> 22:08.665
- Yeah, of course.
- You want to grab a chai tea?

22:08.701 --> 22:09.967
Yeah, you know what
I was thinking?

22:10.002 --> 22:11.501
Post-election,
first order of business.

22:11.537 --> 22:13.971
- If we attack strong...
- Whoa, slow down there, cowboy.

22:14.006 --> 22:16.373
You're already talking
like I'm gonna offer you a job.

22:16.408 --> 22:17.841
I'm gonna offer you a job.

22:17.877 --> 22:19.009
I figured you would.

22:19.044 --> 22:20.811
Of course you got to meet
with Josh DuVall first.

22:20.846 --> 22:22.012
But that's just a formality.

22:22.047 --> 22:23.680
"Josh DuVall"?

22:23.716 --> 22:24.815
Yeah, he's gonna be
the executive director

22:24.850 --> 22:26.049
of my economic council.
He's great.

22:26.085 --> 22:27.317
You're gonna love him.
And Cathy, too.

22:27.353 --> 22:28.719
She's gonna be his deputy.

22:28.754 --> 22:31.121
Josh and Cathy.
They sound good.

22:31.156 --> 22:34.291
Wait a sec, you...
you didn't think I was gonna...

22:34.326 --> 22:36.827
Clyde, you have
no experience in politics.

22:36.862 --> 22:37.995
Uh...

22:38.030 --> 22:39.363
Josh has been at this
for 30 years.

22:39.398 --> 22:41.598
What kind of mayor would I be
if I chose you over him?

22:41.634 --> 22:43.800
I don't know... the kind that
promised to shake things up?

22:43.836 --> 22:46.670
The kind who's gonna
challenge the establishment

22:46.705 --> 22:48.005
with his bold new vision...
do you remember that shit?

22:48.040 --> 22:49.506
- You used to say that to me.
- Hey.

22:49.541 --> 22:51.041
You're still a baby bird, okay?

22:51.076 --> 22:53.343
- Josh is gonna teach you how to fly.
- Wow.

22:53.379 --> 22:54.544
So I'll have his aide reach out
and set up a time...

22:54.580 --> 22:56.313
You know what?
I'm good.

22:56.348 --> 22:57.848
Don't even worry about it.

22:57.883 --> 22:59.182
I'm excellent.
I'm not even some...

22:59.218 --> 23:01.652
Oh, my...
Po-cock!

23:01.687 --> 23:03.921
I'm a baby bird!

23:03.956 --> 23:05.589
It's happening.

23:05.624 --> 23:07.090
I'm doing it!

23:07.126 --> 23:08.825
I'm flying!

23:08.861 --> 23:10.961
Oh, the view is amazing
from up here!

23:10.996 --> 23:14.131
Good-bye, Seth!
Good-bye!

23:15.401 --> 23:17.501
Whoa...!

23:17.536 --> 23:19.436
Okay, all right.

23:19.471 --> 23:22.506
- Whoa...
- All right, all right.

23:22.541 --> 23:26.376
<i>This is a gate change
announcement for Flight 317.</i>

23:26.412 --> 23:28.645
Hey, Clyde, you're here.

23:28.681 --> 23:31.014
- Oh...
- Whoa, whoa, wait a minute!

23:31.050 --> 23:33.016
If you're here,
who's running the city?

23:33.052 --> 23:34.551
Ha...

23:34.586 --> 23:36.219
All right, so I'm standing
there with Seth, right?

23:36.255 --> 23:37.521
- Uh-huh, right.
- And he's offering me this

23:37.556 --> 23:39.723
huge position in
his administration.

23:39.758 --> 23:41.725
But all I could
think about was

23:41.760 --> 23:43.327
I should be on that
plane to Cuba.

23:43.362 --> 23:45.629
'Cause at the
end of the day,

23:45.664 --> 23:47.364
I want to be
with you guys.

23:49.001 --> 23:50.667
- Fuck, my face.
- What?

23:50.703 --> 23:52.336
- Goddamn it!
- Yuck.

23:52.371 --> 23:53.603
The, uh, the last
part, right?

23:53.639 --> 23:55.005
I was right there
with you till that part.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.074
I mean, I really thought
you got the big job

23:57.109 --> 23:58.375
and then you were like,
"I want to be with you guys."

23:58.410 --> 23:59.576
That's not how
I sound like.

23:59.611 --> 24:00.777
- That was the thing...
- It was close!

24:00.813 --> 24:01.912
But that's not
what I sound like.

24:01.947 --> 24:03.347
God, was there ever
even a Seth Buckley?

24:03.382 --> 24:04.614
- Oh, my God.
- Come on.

24:04.650 --> 24:06.249
It's all good.
Hey, we're glad you're here.

24:06.285 --> 24:07.784
Thanks, man.

24:07.820 --> 24:09.353
Did you hear how I did that?

24:09.388 --> 24:10.587
- I love the way you did that.
- So smooth. - Oh.

24:10.622 --> 24:11.722
- Was it good?
- That was nice.

24:16.495 --> 24:17.928
When the sale goes through...

24:17.963 --> 24:20.530
or if-if the sale goes through,

24:20.566 --> 24:22.799
I was thinking,

24:22.835 --> 24:26.236
I might want
to take Phoebe to Rome.

24:26.271 --> 24:27.904
I don't know.
I also,

24:27.940 --> 24:29.906
I've heard that Denmark
is really beautiful.

24:29.942 --> 24:31.508
Regardless,
we're gonna have to discuss

24:31.543 --> 24:33.910
how that affects
our co-parenting.

24:35.247 --> 24:37.848
Hello, Marty?

24:37.883 --> 24:38.982
Hmm?

24:39.018 --> 24:41.318
Uh, yeah...
yeah, all that.

24:41.353 --> 24:42.986
That you said,
whatever, it's great.

24:43.022 --> 24:44.488
Did you hear any
of what I just said?

24:44.523 --> 24:45.622
No.

24:45.657 --> 24:47.791
Why engage on this, right?

24:47.826 --> 24:48.892
Jeannie,

24:48.927 --> 24:50.494
we are orbiting
the fucking payday

24:50.529 --> 24:52.529
to end all
motherfucking paydays.

24:52.564 --> 24:54.164
Please don't pick
this particular moment

24:54.199 --> 24:56.600
to go scurrying
down the rabbit hole.

24:56.635 --> 24:57.901
Uh, trying to plan
for my future

24:57.936 --> 24:59.269
is not scurrying
down a rabbit hole, Marty.

24:59.304 --> 25:00.504
We are far

25:00.539 --> 25:02.039
from done...
you understand that?

25:02.074 --> 25:03.840
Okay, I need your
head in the game

25:03.876 --> 25:05.675
if we're gonna
win this thing.

25:05.711 --> 25:07.477
You want to win
this thing, right?

25:07.513 --> 25:08.645
I don't know.

25:08.680 --> 25:10.180
Now, you don't want
to win this thing?

25:10.215 --> 25:11.748
I didn't say I don't
want to win it.

25:11.784 --> 25:13.450
I just said I don't know.

25:13.485 --> 25:16.086
Jeannie, we're not gonna end
up on a fucking park bench.

25:16.121 --> 25:18.655
Have you thought about it
for one minute?

25:18.690 --> 25:20.357
Have you thought
about what our lives

25:20.392 --> 25:21.792
would be like
if this happens?

25:21.827 --> 25:22.793
Thank you.

25:22.828 --> 25:24.261
Or what our-our daughter's life

25:24.296 --> 25:26.630
would be like if this happens?

25:26.665 --> 25:28.198
So we win.
Let's say we win, okay?

25:28.233 --> 25:29.633
Great, we win.

25:29.668 --> 25:31.034
Monica's bleeding out.

25:31.070 --> 25:33.103
We've pounded Skip
into a fine dust.

25:33.138 --> 25:34.237
Then what?

25:34.273 --> 25:35.605
We mix the dust
and the blood,

25:35.641 --> 25:36.973
put it a goblet
and drink it.

25:37.009 --> 25:38.809
Uh...

25:38.844 --> 25:40.811
We are who we are.

25:40.846 --> 25:42.813
Oh, that's profound.

25:42.848 --> 25:45.382
And the payday of all
motherfucking paydays, Marty,

25:45.417 --> 25:46.750
isn't going to change that.

25:46.785 --> 25:48.385
The only thing
that's gonna change

25:48.420 --> 25:50.387
is that we are not going
to have our company.

25:50.422 --> 25:52.255
And we have been
through so much shit,

25:52.291 --> 25:54.858
and we've come out
on the other side in, like,

25:54.893 --> 25:57.194
a pretty good place.

25:57.229 --> 25:59.996
So...

26:00.032 --> 26:02.699
I'm just saying
can we slow down for a minute

26:02.734 --> 26:04.868
and think about this?

26:04.903 --> 26:07.838
We're going 55 fucking
thousand miles an hour

26:07.873 --> 26:09.973
toward Cuba right now,

26:10.008 --> 26:13.477
and you want to slow
down and think about it.

26:18.550 --> 26:20.550
What, what is it
that you want?

26:32.164 --> 26:35.499
I need goddamn time.
