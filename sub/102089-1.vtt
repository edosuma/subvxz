00:32.380 --> 00:35.426
[Mary] What is this light
that calls to me?

00:48.004 --> 00:49.832
This truth.

00:59.233 --> 01:05.065
If you're real,
show me how to find you.

01:30.568 --> 01:34.920
[tranquil music playing]

02:19.095 --> 02:22.881
Daddy, eggs are on.

02:38.941 --> 02:43.772
[indistinct chatter]

02:43.815 --> 02:46.340
The tomato festival
started today.

03:00.484 --> 03:03.226
You want anything special
for dinner tomorrow?

03:03.270 --> 03:06.708
[man 1 speaking indistinctly
on radio]

03:08.536 --> 03:09.798
[coughs]

03:41.960 --> 03:43.484
Wish we could get some rain.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.541
-Hi, Russell.
-Hi, Mary.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.108
-How are you today?
-I'm good.

04:00.283 --> 04:01.328
Guess which hand.

04:02.894 --> 04:05.593
Ah, ooh, thank you.
That's so sweet.

04:05.636 --> 04:06.811
You're welcome, Mary.

04:10.554 --> 04:13.165
-Bye, Mary.
-[Mary] Bye, Russell.

[crow cawing]

06:08.324 --> 06:12.197
[mellow music playing]

06:13.329 --> 06:15.810
There's probably, uh,
rocket fuel in that.

06:17.899 --> 06:20.031
Yeah, they're finding rocket
fuel in the soil now

06:20.075 --> 06:22.425
where they're growing vegetables
and wheat.

06:22.469 --> 06:23.687
I bet you didn't know that.

06:27.212 --> 06:30.912
Yeah, I mean for a while though
all you had to worry about were
the cows, you know,

06:30.955 --> 06:33.958
because they'd give hormones
to the cows to make them
grow faster,

06:34.002 --> 06:35.917
then the hormones would get in
the milk and...

06:37.571 --> 06:39.442
Oh, don't tell me
your mom let you drink milk.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.794
My mom's dead.

06:43.838 --> 06:44.882
Oof.

06:50.584 --> 06:53.108
So what kind of sandwich
is that?

06:53.151 --> 06:56.720
-Meatloaf.
-Meatloaf? Oh, f...
Oh, my God!

06:56.764 --> 07:00.420
You're going to be flying
to the moon on hormones
and rocket fuel and...

07:03.553 --> 07:06.556
-Look, is that water?
-Yeah.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.906
-Is it clean?
-Yeah.

07:08.950 --> 07:11.343
Yeah, can I... can I buy some?
Is that okay?

07:12.519 --> 07:14.521
-Here you go, just take it.
-Really?

07:14.564 --> 07:17.437
This is not like... like a
radiator or anything, is it?

07:18.350 --> 07:20.788
I don't know if I'm going to
keel over and die
and get poisoned?

07:20.831 --> 07:23.617
-Just leave the empty inside.
-Okay.

07:27.403 --> 07:30.101
-Oh, man.
This is really good.
-Leave the bottle inside.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.626
Hey, you know,
I'm only here for a couple days.

07:32.669 --> 07:35.193
I can really use some
like good water and stuff.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.369
I'll refill it with rocket fuel.
[laughs]

07:39.676 --> 07:41.591
Hey, I'm Cole by the way.

07:46.291 --> 07:50.339
[insects chirping]

08:02.612 --> 08:06.181
[man 1 speaking indistinctly
on radio]

08:49.616 --> 08:51.139
It's getting hot out there.

08:54.185 --> 08:58.581
You know, I got you that fan,
so you can put it on.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.063
Be sure to put it on.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.635
It's pretty busy in town.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.814
All the tourists coming in.

09:21.691 --> 09:26.000
[tranquil music playing]

10:20.358 --> 10:23.492
[traffic noises]

10:24.841 --> 10:28.192
[Cole] Hey, I got your bottle?

10:28.236 --> 10:31.587
-I told you
to leave it at the diner.
-Yeah, I know.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.722
So it was like really,
really good water.
What do you do?

10:35.765 --> 10:38.420
-Do you filter it?
Or is it ionized or--
-No.

10:38.463 --> 10:41.641
Also, it's like the best
I've ever had.

10:41.684 --> 10:44.078
-Where do you get it?
-A well.

10:44.121 --> 10:49.213
A well? [laughs]
Like a ground well,
from the ground?

10:49.257 --> 10:52.956
Ha, I guess that makes sense.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.308
Sediment filtration, no chloride
in it, so what's that you do?

10:57.352 --> 11:00.007
You sort of go around town
and sell water?

11:00.050 --> 11:01.312
Yep.

11:01.356 --> 11:04.664
-They buy it?
-Sometimes.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.144
It's really cool.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.366
I need to go.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.890
Hey, do you mind
if I come with you?

11:13.934 --> 11:16.284
I'm only going to be in town
for a couple days.

11:16.327 --> 11:18.547
I'm getting a new timing belt
put on my car,
so I've got some time to kill.

11:18.590 --> 11:21.115
I'm on my way
to, uh, Grand Flats, Utah.
You ever been?

11:21.158 --> 11:22.769
Mm-mm.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.640
People say it's the
eighth wonder of the world.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.860
It's the, uh, lowest
point in North America.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.297
Everyone thinks
it's Death Valley, but it's not.

11:29.340 --> 11:34.389
This is 270 feet below sea level
and it's a 1100 depth valley.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.130
-Wow.
-Yeah.

11:36.173 --> 11:39.133
I could just tag along,
kind of walk with you.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.657
We don't have to talk.
I'll be silent.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.661
I could really use the company.

11:50.013 --> 11:54.409
[mellow music playing]

13:00.518 --> 13:02.477
You know, I'm going after
Grand Flats, did I tell you?

13:02.520 --> 13:04.609
-Where?
-Sawtooth National Forest.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.307
-You ever been?
-Nope.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.875
It's the, uh, ninth
tallest point in all of Idaho.

13:08.918 --> 13:12.748
It's like 12,009 feet
above sea level.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.445
-Does this go here?
-Yeah.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.013
[groans]

13:17.057 --> 13:20.147
So this is what you do?

13:20.190 --> 13:22.671
You just travel the country,
you go into different places?

13:22.714 --> 13:24.412
Yeah, that's the plan.
[chuckles]

13:26.718 --> 13:28.720
What's the coolest place
you've ever been?

13:28.764 --> 13:31.158
-Here?
-Yeah, here or outside here.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.377
-I've never been outside of
here. -Really?

13:33.421 --> 13:35.205
Hmm.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.686
Yeah, I mean that's cool.
This is... It's a cool place.

13:39.514 --> 13:41.429
Hey, thanks for letting
me come with you today.

13:41.472 --> 13:42.909
I kind of needed it.
I was getting
a little sick of myself.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.607
Are you staying at the motel?

13:45.650 --> 13:47.348
Uh, Casa Ceviche.

13:47.391 --> 13:51.439
-Where's that?
-It's my car.
It's a Honda Civic.

13:51.482 --> 13:56.357
-You're sleeping in your car.
-Yeah, it kind of came to a stop
on the side of the road,

13:56.400 --> 13:58.228
right outside of town.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.013
I didn't want to leave it there
and go in a motel,

14:00.056 --> 14:02.145
I was kind of afraid my stuff
would get stolen so...

14:02.189 --> 14:04.452
But it's nice. It's great.
There's like a creek right there

14:04.495 --> 14:07.020
and the sun kind of
rises above the hills.
It's really pretty.

14:07.063 --> 14:09.587
Plus, I'm used to it. When I was
a kid, my dad used to take me

14:09.631 --> 14:11.633
to all these kind of
cool different places.

14:11.676 --> 14:14.418
He used to say,
"We owe it to ourselves
to see everything we can."

14:14.462 --> 14:16.116
So why didn't he
come with you?

14:16.159 --> 14:18.422
A road trip sounds
like a father-son thing to do.

14:18.466 --> 14:23.253
Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Um, he passed away.

14:23.297 --> 14:27.605
He, uh... he was a painter.
He used to paint landscapes.

14:27.649 --> 14:31.348
He always wanted to paint
Grand Flats,
but he never did, so...

14:31.392 --> 14:34.090
In a way, this trip
is like kind of for him.

14:35.352 --> 14:36.440
It's cool.

14:40.705 --> 14:43.795
-Would you want to see the well?
-Hmm?

14:43.839 --> 14:47.538
-The well.
-Like, like your well?
Like the water well?

14:47.582 --> 14:52.456
-Yeah, if it's interesting.
-Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.459
-It's a bit of a walk from here.
-Sure, yeah.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.548
-All right.
-Yeah, let's do it. All right.

14:57.592 --> 14:58.767
-[Mary] Cool.
-[Cole] There you go.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.552
-Thanks.
-Okay, lead the way.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.297
-[Mary] This is it.
-[Cole] Wow!

15:07.341 --> 15:10.300
[insects chirping]

15:11.954 --> 15:13.956
It's around to the side.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.356
-That's it.
-Oh, man!
This is awesome.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.969
-You can pump it if you want?
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.623
-All right.
-Okay, what do I do?

15:28.666 --> 15:31.278
-So you're going
to put your hand here.
-Okay.

15:31.321 --> 15:34.716
And then, you're going to put
your hand there on the handle
and then you're going to go up.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.413
Okay.

15:36.457 --> 15:38.763
-Three times.
-All right.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.896
-And it's going to be a little
hard when you come back down.
-All right.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.898
-I look like a man now.
-There you go.

15:42.942 --> 15:49.557
-One, two, three.
-[handle clanking]

15:49.600 --> 15:52.560
-There it goes. Well done.
-[laughs]

15:54.866 --> 15:58.653
My dad used to tell the story
of the guy who drilled this.

15:58.696 --> 16:02.004
My mom really wanted a well.
And so, he had a couple
different men from the city

16:02.048 --> 16:04.528
come out
with their fancy equipment.

16:04.572 --> 16:07.836
They drilled all over the place,
couldn't find anything.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.620
So dad had this old man come out

16:09.664 --> 16:13.798
with this handmade, um,
rickety trailer

16:13.842 --> 16:16.888
-and he had these sticks
that tilt down.
-A dowsing rod?

16:16.932 --> 16:19.326
And... It's... A dowsing rod.
So he had a dowsing rod

16:19.369 --> 16:22.546
and he was walking around
and they tilted down

16:22.590 --> 16:25.419
and this is where he drilled

16:25.462 --> 16:29.989
and water came up on the first
shot and hasn't gone dry since.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.992
That is really cool.
That is a really cool story.

16:34.732 --> 16:37.039
-Take that.
I'll show you something else.
-Yeah?

16:37.083 --> 16:38.649
-Yeah.
-Okay.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.438
We used to have horses up there.

16:44.481 --> 16:48.442
[mellow music playing]

16:53.142 --> 16:55.057
-This is cool.
-She is.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.146
[chuckles]

16:58.060 --> 17:00.193
Hey.

17:00.236 --> 17:03.065
-Oh. A boy or girl?
-A girl.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.807
-Girl. Hey, what's her name?
-Pepper.

17:05.850 --> 17:08.157
Pepper!
What's up Pepper?

17:09.115 --> 17:12.205
Are you itchy?
[laughs]

17:13.162 --> 17:15.904
-She's shy, huh?
-Yeah.
-Hey.

17:24.869 --> 17:27.176
-Can I take a look?
-Uh, yeah.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.483
Let's see.
What are we working with?

17:29.526 --> 17:31.572
Okay.

17:31.615 --> 17:35.315
Give me like, um, longer screws
and a screwdriver.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.621
-It's inside so--
-Yeah, it's okay.
Go grab it real quick.

17:37.665 --> 17:40.059
-No, it's okay.
-It's going to take me
like two seconds to fix.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.364
Um...

17:43.584 --> 17:45.064
Yeah. Go grab it.

17:48.632 --> 17:52.027
[man 1 speaking indistinctly
on radio]

18:11.394 --> 18:14.310
Daddy, daddy.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.053
Someone's fixing the feeder.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.925
I'll start dinner
as soon as he finishes.

18:24.712 --> 18:27.541
No we don't have to pay him.
He's just doing it to help.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.760
It's okay.
It's just someone I met in town.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.849
I'll fix dinner
as soon as he finishes.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.027
Uh, I'm sure he has to go.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.510
Okay, okay.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.520
-Here you go.
-Perfect.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.261
Oh, yeah, this is great.

18:54.524 --> 19:00.008
My dad wanted to know if you
wanted something to eat in
exchange for fixing the feeder.

19:00.051 --> 19:01.531
Is that cool?

19:03.620 --> 19:05.056
Yeah.

19:06.101 --> 19:09.060
Yeah, I'd like that a lot.
Thanks.

19:09.104 --> 19:12.063
-20 minutes.
-I'll be here.

19:12.107 --> 19:13.195
Okay.

19:14.501 --> 19:18.853
[mellow music playing]

19:49.362 --> 19:50.928
[door squeaks open]

19:50.972 --> 19:52.234
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.801
Fixed.

19:54.976 --> 19:56.369
Ah...

19:59.154 --> 20:01.069
-There you go.
-Wow! Thank you.

20:01.112 --> 20:02.418
Welcome.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.682
-You hungry?
-Starving.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.945
Great. [chuckles]

20:07.989 --> 20:11.819
[man 1 speaking indistinctly
on radio]

20:16.432 --> 20:18.260
You don't have to eat the
pork chops if you don't want to.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.828
No, this is great. Thanks.

20:20.871 --> 20:24.571
-You can wash your hands
over there.
-Cool. Yeah.

20:38.672 --> 20:43.024
Dad, um, this is Cole.
Cole, this is my dad.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.335
How are you, sir?
It's really great to meet you.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.294
You can sit over there.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.165
Cool.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.521
Cole's just here
for a couple of days.

21:01.564 --> 21:04.785
He's, um, going to see...
What was it?

21:04.828 --> 21:08.397
Uh, Grand Flats, Utah.

21:08.441 --> 21:11.313
People say it's the
eighth wonder of the world.

21:11.357 --> 21:13.228
It's the lowest point
in North America.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.362
Everyone says
it's Death Valley but it's not.

21:16.405 --> 21:19.930
-Did I tell you that already?
-Uh, yeah.

21:19.974 --> 21:21.628
Yeah. [chuckles]

21:21.671 --> 21:23.717
-Um, potatoes okay?
-Yeah, it's great.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.327
-[Mary] Okay.
-Thanks.

21:34.858 --> 21:39.472
So, uh, your water is like the
best I've ever had, seriously.

21:39.515 --> 21:44.477
Mary was telling me the story
about the guy who came to drill
the well using a dowsing rod.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.609
That's so cool.
It's a great story.

21:47.654 --> 21:50.352
I was with Mary earlier
when she was selling the bottles
around town.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.966
Did you tell your dad
that we found an arrowhead?

21:56.010 --> 21:58.578
-It was a rock, heh.
-It was an arrowhead.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.710
I'm telling you it
was an arrowhead.

22:00.754 --> 22:02.016
Actually, you know what?
You could be
the judge of this for us.

22:02.059 --> 22:06.107
I picked it up.
Um, you know what?

22:06.150 --> 22:07.978
It must have fallen out.

22:09.632 --> 22:13.593
I think we're both right though
because an arrowhead
is a rock, right?

22:13.636 --> 22:15.899
I mean what else are you going
to make an arrowhead out of?

22:15.943 --> 22:20.295
Something squishy,
like a worm or a dead fish?

22:21.340 --> 22:23.342
Although, maybe you would,
maybe you would use a dead fish.

22:23.385 --> 22:25.605
You wouldn't
have to tie it to anything.

22:25.648 --> 22:27.650
-All you have to do is hold
it out in front of you, right?
-[chuckles]

22:27.694 --> 22:29.043
[Cole] That's a good idea.
I don't have
a lot of good ideas.

22:29.086 --> 22:30.523
I think that one could work.

22:32.438 --> 22:36.355
[mellow music playing]

22:36.398 --> 22:38.922
So he grabs this thing
with both hands, right?

22:38.966 --> 22:41.664
And it's huge, it's enormous
and it's fighting and it's
flipping and it's kicking him.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.710
I mean, come on,
it's so much of work.

22:43.753 --> 22:48.541
I wouldn't do that,
but you, noodling, come on.
[chuckles]

22:48.584 --> 22:50.107
Are you sure
you don't want some?

22:50.151 --> 22:52.240
Mm, I'm okay. Thanks.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.118
Dad?

23:12.260 --> 23:13.392
[door closes]

23:13.435 --> 23:18.048
[tranquil music playing]

24:19.414 --> 24:21.764
[music fades]

24:25.551 --> 24:27.509
So something happened to him?

24:28.554 --> 24:31.295
-My dad?
-Yeah.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.689
-He had a stroke.
-Oh, man.

24:34.908 --> 24:37.127
Recently?

24:37.171 --> 24:38.825
After my mom died.

24:38.868 --> 24:40.435
When was that?

24:41.480 --> 24:42.959
When I was six.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.354
You've taken care of him
ever since?

24:46.397 --> 24:48.443
He can't be on his own.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.490
And selling water
pays the bills?

24:52.839 --> 24:56.712
He gets disability checks
and I do my best to help.

24:59.541 --> 25:00.934
It's really sweet.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.327
You should go.

25:03.371 --> 25:06.374
[crickets chirping]

25:14.077 --> 25:15.165
I can't.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.560
Please go.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.562
-I... I'm sorry. I thought--
-Please go.

25:20.606 --> 25:24.392
Okay. Yeah, yeah.
I'm sorry. I, uh...

25:28.309 --> 25:32.792
[mellow music playing]

25:54.857 --> 25:58.644
[tense music playing]

26:53.829 --> 26:57.311
[birds chirping]

27:23.816 --> 27:27.558
-[gasps]
-Sorry.
-Oh, God!

27:27.602 --> 27:28.995
Oh, you scared
the heck out of me.

27:29.038 --> 27:30.474
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

27:30.518 --> 27:32.085
[clears throat]

27:33.477 --> 27:34.653
[groans]

27:36.611 --> 27:38.265
[laughs]

27:38.308 --> 27:41.398
-You found me.
-It wasn't hard.

27:45.402 --> 27:46.969
What are you doing here?

27:48.492 --> 27:50.190
I brought you this.
I thought you could use it.

27:50.233 --> 27:53.193
Oh, thanks.

27:57.850 --> 28:00.679
-I'm sorry about last night.
I--
-No. I'm... I'm sorry.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.246
-The way I reacted--
-I'm sorry.

28:03.290 --> 28:05.901
-I shouldn't have--
-I... I just can't.

28:06.902 --> 28:08.034
I get it.

28:11.472 --> 28:14.388
So this is you.

28:14.431 --> 28:17.043
Yeah, it's me.

28:17.086 --> 28:21.917
-Casa Caviche?
-Uh, Ceviche.

28:21.961 --> 28:25.355
It's, um, raw fish
in lime juice.

28:26.269 --> 28:28.184
Um...

28:28.228 --> 28:32.014
-Casa Ceviche.
-There it is.

28:32.058 --> 28:34.756
Yeah,
she's reliable most of the time.

28:36.236 --> 28:41.415
Um, before you'd asked me
where my favorite place was.

28:42.895 --> 28:45.549
I was just wondering if...

28:46.420 --> 28:49.640
before you leave, if you wanted
to see my favorite place here.

28:49.684 --> 28:51.947
I could show you.

28:51.991 --> 28:54.471
Unless you don't want to
and that's fine.

28:54.515 --> 28:56.212
Oh, boy. Uh...

28:57.126 --> 28:58.649
You sure that's a good idea?

28:59.999 --> 29:02.479
If it's interesting.

29:02.523 --> 29:05.221
Yeah, I know it's...
it's very interesting. I...

29:07.267 --> 29:08.398
I would love that.

29:10.270 --> 29:12.054
Okay.

29:12.098 --> 29:15.492
Uh, meet me outside
the diner tomorrow at 9:30?

29:15.536 --> 29:19.714
Sounds good.
I'll bring sandwiches.
You, uh, bring water.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.283
-Deal.
-Okay.

30:27.608 --> 30:29.697
Are you sure
you're okay with this?

30:39.968 --> 30:42.623
Okay. I'll be back in time
to make dinner.

30:57.203 --> 30:59.118
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:59.161 --> 31:01.685
-Wow, you look great.
-Thanks.

31:01.729 --> 31:04.688
-I brought water.
-I brought sandwiches.

31:04.732 --> 31:06.865
-Great, you ready?
-Let's do it.

31:07.866 --> 31:08.997
Let's go.

[music fades]

33:14.209 --> 33:15.732
All right.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.257
Wow!

33:19.954 --> 33:21.651
You can see the sunrise
from here.

33:27.614 --> 33:29.355
I like the way the light feels.

33:31.574 --> 33:33.315
It takes away my fear.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.014
Fear of what?

33:37.928 --> 33:39.278
Messing up.

33:45.849 --> 33:47.895
-Hey, can I ask you something?
-Mm-hmm.

33:47.938 --> 33:49.505
What happened to your mom?

33:51.855 --> 33:56.773
One day my dad said she had a
stomachache and it never went
away, ended up being cancer.

33:58.601 --> 34:01.256
By the time they figured it out,
it was too late.

34:02.301 --> 34:06.479
My dad worked really
hard to take care of everything.

34:06.522 --> 34:08.916
The doctor said, he overdid it.

34:10.352 --> 34:12.311
Is that what caused the stroke?

34:14.139 --> 34:17.664
I found him in the
field one day on the ground.

34:18.795 --> 34:20.232
He couldn't talk.

34:21.407 --> 34:22.886
I froze.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.240
Let me show you something.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.773
-That is where I'm from.
-Hmm.

34:39.816 --> 34:41.644
Danville, Virginia.

34:42.776 --> 34:44.560
Is it nice?

34:44.604 --> 34:49.261
It's... it's okay. It's mostly
rednecks and hillbillies.

34:49.304 --> 34:52.177
The CIA and FBI headquarter
is up north.

34:52.220 --> 34:55.484
Wow!
This is everywhere you've been.

34:55.528 --> 34:57.007
So far.

35:00.054 --> 35:01.534
[Mary] You have a pen?

35:12.284 --> 35:14.634
Now you know you've been here.

35:20.901 --> 35:25.819
All right, if you can where
go anywhere, where would it be?

35:27.168 --> 35:30.867
I've seen pictures of the ocean
that were amazing.

35:30.911 --> 35:32.739
Yes, which ocean?

35:33.696 --> 35:37.004
Um, I don't know
which one it was.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.925
Well,
this is pretty amazing too.

35:47.406 --> 35:48.668
Yeah.

35:50.844 --> 35:53.063
You ever had kale?

35:53.107 --> 35:57.198
It's vitamins A, C, E, B6,

35:57.242 --> 36:00.549
magnesium, pantothenic acid.

36:00.593 --> 36:03.117
It's yours. Cheers.

-Cheers.
-After you.

36:11.691 --> 36:17.436
-Very, mm, very green.
-Yeah.

-Mm.

37:53.053 --> 37:54.924
[music fades]

37:54.968 --> 37:58.319
So where are you going
after the Sawtooth place?

37:58.363 --> 38:01.409
-Sawtooth National Forest.
-Yeah.

38:01.453 --> 38:04.194
Uh, I don't know. Get a job.

38:04.238 --> 38:06.196
-You?
-Yeah, right?

38:06.240 --> 38:07.850
[laughs]
Yeah, but doing what?

38:07.894 --> 38:09.983
I don't know,
something outside maybe.

38:10.026 --> 38:12.942
-I'd be seriously impressed.
-Thanks. [chuckles]

38:16.076 --> 38:18.121
I have a son.

38:20.036 --> 38:22.256
-What?
-He's two.

38:22.300 --> 38:25.564
He lives in Pittsburgh
with my ex.

38:27.522 --> 38:31.613
I'm not with her
anymore or anything. She...

38:31.657 --> 38:34.573
She wanted to be
with another guy so she was.

38:36.966 --> 38:41.971
-Oh, um, you have a son?
-Yeah. Heh.

38:43.973 --> 38:47.150
That's him.
I've never met him before.

38:48.543 --> 38:53.679
She was pregnant and I was going
to marry her, but she left so...

38:55.420 --> 38:58.988
-You didn't stop her?
-I didn't try.

39:00.947 --> 39:04.298
-Is she still with him?
-I don't know.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.213
It kind of messed me up.

39:07.954 --> 39:09.390
Wow!

39:11.784 --> 39:13.438
I don't love her.

39:14.439 --> 39:17.746
My ex. I...
I don't love her anymore.

39:19.444 --> 39:20.749
Hmm.

39:23.317 --> 39:25.188
We should probably get going,
huh?

39:25.232 --> 39:27.669
Uh, yeah.

39:27.713 --> 39:30.150
Thanks for today.

39:30.193 --> 39:32.761
Mm-hmm. Oh.

39:42.728 --> 39:44.251
Thanks.

Okay. I'll be back.

There you go.

It was no big deal.

42:36.641 --> 42:38.904
It was just a walk.

42:38.947 --> 42:40.601
It was a mistake.

-Your car's working.
-Yep, got the belt put in,
checked into a hotel,

took a shower, feel great.

-I'm working.

Everything okay?

47:21.926 --> 47:24.058
So when are you leaving?

47:24.102 --> 47:27.496
I was thinking about early
tomorrow morning,
getting a head start.

47:27.540 --> 47:31.152
It takes eight or nine hours to
get to Grand Flats. I figured
I'd get there by nighttime.

47:32.458 --> 47:34.373
Then what?

47:34.416 --> 47:36.157
Sawtooth National Forest.

47:36.201 --> 47:37.811
I don't know.

47:38.725 --> 47:42.033
That's right. You have a whole
map of red stars to fill in.

What's that supposed to mean?

47:44.426 --> 47:48.256

-Just keep on moving.
-Come with me.

47:51.694 --> 47:53.218
-To Grand Flats?
-Yeah.

47:53.261 --> 47:56.264
-And Sawtooth National Forest?
-Sure, why not?

47:56.308 --> 47:59.615
-Can I bring my dad?
-If you want, bring him.
I don't care.

47:59.659 --> 48:02.401
-[scoffs] Right.
-Or don't.

48:02.444 --> 48:04.882
Leave him here. It seems like
he can take care of himself.

48:04.925 --> 48:07.623
-Is that what you think?
-He seems okay to me.

48:07.667 --> 48:10.278
Because you're the expert
on everything.

48:10.322 --> 48:14.630
Mary, he walked out
on the field with us.

48:14.674 --> 48:16.937
You know,
he held that giant rabbit,

48:16.981 --> 48:21.637
but yet you feel like you need
to cut his food for him,
clean up after him.

48:21.681 --> 48:23.770
He gets disability checks,

48:23.813 --> 48:25.946

town to help out
the best you can.

-It doesn't make any sense.
-You don't know.

48:30.864 --> 48:34.433
He can take care of himself
and you don't want him to.

48:37.088 --> 48:40.569
Mary, you can't go through life
too afraid to act
on something you feel

48:40.613 --> 48:42.789
because you're too terrified
something's going to happen
to your dad

48:42.832 --> 48:44.965
and you're not going to be there
to take care of him.

48:45.009 --> 48:48.926
Because things do, things happen
and you need to be there
to deal with it.

48:48.969 --> 48:51.319
Okay, so they happen
and then you deal with it.

48:51.363 --> 48:54.496
-Like you are with your son?
-[chuckles]

48:55.367 --> 48:58.674
Right, of course.

49:05.638 --> 49:07.553
Mary.

49:07.596 --> 49:12.297
[tense music playing]

49:21.001 --> 49:22.872
Mary.

49:24.744 --> 49:27.616
Mary, come on.

49:27.660 --> 49:29.531
I'm sorry, okay.

49:30.576 --> 49:32.012
Mary.

49:49.638 --> 49:53.686
[Cole]
He can take care of himself
and you don't want him to.

49:53.729 --> 49:58.952
[mellow music playing]

51:28.911 --> 51:32.089
[breathing heavily]

51:42.795 --> 51:45.798
[Mary] What is this light
that calls to me?

52:00.508 --> 52:02.989
Warm to my skin.

52:06.166 --> 52:07.559
To my heart.

52:24.576 --> 52:26.752
Where do you go
when you leave me?

52:33.019 --> 52:35.804
Or is it I that strays?

52:46.989 --> 52:50.079
[music fades]

52:52.386 --> 52:55.607
[man 1 speaking indistinctly
on radio]

52:57.261 --> 53:00.525
We brought you a pie
for the 4th of July, Mary.

53:00.568 --> 53:03.789
-Thank you, Russell.
-It's blueberry.
We baked it last night.

53:04.659 --> 53:06.313
That's so nice.

53:06.357 --> 53:08.707
Do you and your father
have any plans for tomorrow?

53:08.750 --> 53:12.711
-We're just going to be here.
-I was going to fix some food,
nothing fancy.

53:12.754 --> 53:14.495
Just thought maybe you guys
want to come join us?

53:14.539 --> 53:18.195
-[gasps] Do you still
have a rabbit, Mary?
-We do.

53:18.238 --> 53:20.980
-How is she?
How is your rabbit?
-She's fine.

53:21.023 --> 53:23.461
-Does she get enough to eat?
-I think so.

53:23.504 --> 53:26.464
Mom, can we come here tomorrow
for the 4th of July instead, so
we could play with the rabbit?

53:26.507 --> 53:29.641
Well, we came over here
to invite Mary and her father
to our house.

53:29.684 --> 53:32.252
But if we came here, we'd
be able to play with the rabbit.

53:32.296 --> 53:36.691
Wouldn't we, Mary? We would be
able to play with the rabbit
if we came here?

53:36.735 --> 53:40.521
-You guys
want to come over here?
-Yes, please, Mary.

53:40.565 --> 53:44.177
-Russell, honey--
-It actually would be easier for
my dad, if you guys came here.

53:44.221 --> 53:46.179
-[chuckles]
-Are you sure?

53:46.223 --> 53:48.268
Yeah, it'd be good
to see you guys.

53:48.312 --> 53:50.749
Would you like us to bring
some food for the rabbit, Mary?

53:50.792 --> 53:52.968
Do you want to
bring some carrots?

53:53.012 --> 53:56.102
Okay, Mary. I will bring
some carrots for the rabbit.

53:56.145 --> 53:58.191
-Two o'clock?
-Okay.

53:58.235 --> 53:59.801
See you then. Thanks.

53:59.845 --> 54:02.326
-Bye, Mary.
-[Mary] Bye, Russell.

54:12.031 --> 54:14.294
That was Russell and Laura.

54:14.338 --> 54:16.601
They wanted to know if we wanted
to go to their house
for a picnic tomorrow.

54:16.644 --> 54:19.386
I told them I thought it'd
be easier if they came here.

54:23.564 --> 54:25.131
I'll go to the store.

54:28.003 --> 54:30.049
I'm fine. I'm fine.

54:34.401 --> 54:36.447
You want anything special
for tomorrow?

54:39.276 --> 54:42.017
Fine,
I'll get whatever's on sale.

59:09.937 --> 59:12.636
[Mary]
Tell me what you want from me?

59:33.352 --> 59:36.877
[birds chirping]

59:51.109 --> 59:52.284
[Mary] Dad!

59:55.766 --> 59:56.767
Dad!

59:59.421 --> 1:00:01.336
What are you doing out here?

1:00:02.773 --> 1:00:05.776
I'm about to fix dinner.
Why don't you come inside?

1:00:06.820 --> 1:00:08.561
Daddy!

1:00:09.518 --> 1:00:11.085
What is it?

1:00:13.392 --> 1:00:15.524
Daddy, what is it?

1:00:23.271 --> 1:00:25.317
[door closes]

1:00:27.014 --> 1:00:33.630
Dad, open the door. Dad!
What is going on?

1:00:33.673 --> 1:00:38.025

The... the house you grew up in.

1:03:20.405 --> 1:03:22.668
[Mary's father mumbles]
In this town...

1:03:22.711 --> 1:03:26.454
[tranquil music playing]

1:03:33.722 --> 1:03:35.246
Mama's house.

1:03:36.551 --> 1:03:38.771
In this town...

1:03:41.121 --> 1:03:42.296
we never left.

1:03:44.168 --> 1:03:49.608
Your mother and I never got
a chance to see other places.

1:03:51.392 --> 1:03:53.394
I would like to.

1:03:55.701 --> 1:03:58.530
What happened to me
was not your fault.

1:04:01.402 --> 1:04:05.406
What happened to me
was not your fault.

1:04:07.147 --> 1:04:11.325
Don't let me stop you
from seeing other places,

1:04:12.631 --> 1:04:15.112
experiencing things...

1:04:16.548 --> 1:04:18.332
special things.

1:04:21.683 --> 1:04:25.078
You've taken care of me
your whole life.

1:04:27.646 --> 1:04:30.301
I'm just fine.

[knocking on door]

1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:17.000
-Hey, happy 4th of July.
-[Russell] Happy 4th of July,
Mary.

1:05:17.043 --> 1:05:20.133
-Happy 4th...
Russell, let me get this.
-We bought carrots.

1:05:20.177 --> 1:05:21.482
-I see.
-Carrots for the rabbit.

1:05:21.526 --> 1:05:24.094
I see. Come in, come in.

1:05:29.751 --> 1:05:33.842
-[chuckles] Can I go out?
-Sure, honey.

1:05:35.801 --> 1:05:39.022
[Russell] Happy 4th of July.

1:05:47.552 --> 1:05:50.250
-How's your dad?
-[Mary] He's good.

1:05:51.338 --> 1:05:53.514
[Laura] I haven't seen him
in a really long time.

1:05:54.994 --> 1:05:57.127
I'm glad you guys are here.

1:05:59.216 --> 1:06:00.913
Me too.

1:07:43.624 --> 1:07:45.670
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:07:47.063 --> 1:07:50.327
-I thought
you went to Grand Flats.
-I did.

1:07:50.370 --> 1:07:51.719
You got a sec?

1:07:53.069 --> 1:07:54.505
Yeah.

1:08:02.034 --> 1:08:04.819
So, how was it?

1:08:04.863 --> 1:08:07.474
It was big, empty.

1:08:08.780 --> 1:08:11.652
When I was there,
I thought about what you said.

1:08:11.696 --> 1:08:13.959
About what?

1:08:14.002 --> 1:08:17.354
How things sometimes happen
and you have to be there
to deal with them.

1:08:17.397 --> 1:08:20.008
-I'm not the one
to be giving advice.
-[chuckles softly]

1:08:21.184 --> 1:08:23.925
I'm going to Pittsburgh
to be with my son.

1:08:25.536 --> 1:08:27.799
-Oh!
-When I was standing
in Grand Flats,

1:08:27.842 --> 1:08:30.193
I realized you were right.

1:08:30.236 --> 1:08:32.760
I've been making all of my
decisions out of fear
and when I figured that out,

1:08:32.804 --> 1:08:38.331
this calming feeling came over
me and for the first time
things sort of made sense.

1:08:38.375 --> 1:08:39.593
Hmm.

1:08:41.595 --> 1:08:45.556
We're not meant to live our life
in fear and that's what
I was doing.

1:08:51.214 --> 1:08:53.738
Come on, I got you something.

1:09:06.316 --> 1:09:07.447

1:09:20.373 --> 1:09:22.636
Thanks.

Why don't you come in?

1:09:26.118 --> 1:09:28.990
Uh, I should probably go.

Okay.

that loves me?

Warm to my skin.

1:15:27.610 --> 1:15:29.525
To my heart.

that loves me.
