00:10.051 --> 00:11.803
<i>I never really thought I'd be
an astronaut.</i>

00:11.886 --> 00:14.180
<i>I always considered it more of a dream</i>

00:14.305 --> 00:16.933
<i>rather than something
that would actually happen.</i>

00:21.021 --> 00:26.067
We understand how fragile Earth is
because we have a very clear view

00:26.151 --> 00:30.405
of how thin the atmosphere is,
how fragile our planet is.

00:30.864 --> 00:34.534
<i>It still, sort of, is amazing to me that,
here I am,</i>

00:34.909 --> 00:36.286
<i>living... living the dream.</i>

00:38.997 --> 00:44.002
It's just so unique and such
an incredible humbling place to see it.

00:45.003 --> 00:48.423
I'm Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano
from the European Space Agency.

00:50.258 --> 00:54.637
<i>I was born in Sicily,
far away from anything airspace related.</i>

00:55.513 --> 00:59.934
<i>So, I turned 19, I was in love
with flying...</i>

01:01.144 --> 01:05.690
<i>so I went to the Italian Air Force Academy
with this dream of becoming an astronaut.</i>

01:11.321 --> 01:13.948
<i>And then when I was announced
as an astronaut...</i>

01:15.408 --> 01:17.077
<i>I can tell you that I started crying.</i>

01:18.161 --> 01:19.454
<i>Crying tears of joy.</i>

01:20.789 --> 01:23.208
And after that I don't think I slept
for about a week.

01:26.169 --> 01:29.422
I think exploration
is just part of human nature.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.592
Five hundred years ago
I would have liked to be on those boats

01:32.675 --> 01:34.427
that sailed towards America,

01:34.844 --> 01:39.724
and today I happen to be embarking
on a much bigger exploration.

01:43.394 --> 01:46.773
<i>The continuing science of AMS
is going to revolutionize</i>

01:46.856 --> 01:49.192
<i>the way we understand the universe.</i>

01:49.943 --> 01:52.362
Hi. I'm Astronaut Drew Morgan.

01:52.695 --> 01:54.239
You may remember me from...

01:55.281 --> 01:56.741
- Are you still recording?
Yes.

01:56.908 --> 01:59.244
You may remember me from such EVAs as...

02:00.203 --> 02:02.372
P six batteries, part one and two...

02:02.789 --> 02:04.833
- How's it going? Is it going all right?

02:05.208 --> 02:07.293
<i>For Drew and I, this is probably</i>

02:07.794 --> 02:10.797
a big part of our legacy,
if we ever have one.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.281
<i>Good morning
from Mission Control in Houston</i>

02:36.406 --> 02:39.075
<i>and the International Space Station
flight control room.</i>

02:39.409 --> 02:42.579
<i>You are looking live inside
the station's Quest airlock,</i>

02:42.912 --> 02:46.499
<i>where two astronauts,
expedition 61 commander Luca Parmitano</i>

02:46.833 --> 02:49.502
<i>and NASA flight engineer Drew Morgan,
are suited up,</i>

02:49.669 --> 02:52.714
<i>ready to begin the first
of at least four complex spacewalks.</i>

02:53.965 --> 02:56.176
<i>These spacewalks, uh, were first designed</i>

02:56.259 --> 03:00.013
<i>and, uh, began to be formulated
some four years ago</i>

03:00.263 --> 03:03.224
<i>with a cast of thousands
bringing us to this day,</i>

03:03.474 --> 03:08.229
<i>the first of four spacewalks
to repair the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer.</i>

03:08.313 --> 03:10.190
- What's up, Mike?
Hey, Chris, good morning.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.399
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

03:17.989 --> 03:19.991
<i>Being with this AMS team throughout,</i>

03:20.200 --> 03:22.410
<i>we've gone through
some ups and downs in emotions</i>

03:22.535 --> 03:26.247
but it's so cool to feel the momentum,
feel the energy, feel the excitement.

03:27.373 --> 03:30.126
<i>I'm super excited to watch my friends
and get it all done.</i>

03:31.669 --> 03:34.297
<i>This is the stuff a lot of folks
have worked a lot of hours</i>

03:34.422 --> 03:35.423
<i>for several years...</i>

03:36.382 --> 03:39.761
to bring it all together,
so it's fun to see it all occur

03:39.844 --> 03:41.638
and hopefully be very successful
at the end.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.600
<i>Luca and Drew, good morning.
Good to be with you.</i>

03:47.268 --> 03:48.811
<i>We've got a good plan
and we've got the time</i>

03:48.895 --> 03:51.231
<i>to do this right once,
so that's what we'll do.</i>

03:58.488 --> 04:01.407
<i>-Yes, sir, we are on the same page.
Sounds good.</i>

04:03.034 --> 04:04.661
<i>Okay, for both of you,
you can take</i>

04:04.744 --> 04:07.038
<i>your temperature control valves
to max hot.</i>

04:14.545 --> 04:15.546
<i>Okay.</i>

04:20.051 --> 04:23.972
<i>After 25 years, uh...
uh, it's not just Professor Ting's baby,</i>

04:24.055 --> 04:26.849
<i>it's all of us that have worked on it,
it all becomes part of us.</i>

04:28.268 --> 04:31.104
They built some amazing things
that are gonna make this happen.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.899
<i>You know, the... the clean cutter,
the rough cutter, the tube straightener...</i>

04:36.109 --> 04:39.779
<i>but the debris shield
was never designed to be removed.</i>

04:40.530 --> 04:44.242
We have all sorts of things
to keep it from coming off.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.953
That's what it's designed to do,
not come off.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.999
<i>If we can't get this shield off,
the EVA is done.</i>

04:53.960 --> 04:55.545
<i>The first EVA...</i>

04:57.839 --> 05:01.175
<i>First we've got to gain access
to everything that we need to get to.</i>

05:02.552 --> 05:06.139
<i>So we've gotta take off the big debris
shield on the side of the AMS.</i>

05:07.974 --> 05:12.270
<i>So we've had to develop, uh,
handling aids to be able to do that.</i>

05:13.396 --> 05:15.940
<i>But we don't know what's gonna...</i>

05:16.316 --> 05:18.609
<i>What everything's gonna look like
when we take the debris shield off,</i>

05:19.360 --> 05:22.822
<i>so there's a lot of, just,
real unknowns going into this.</i>

05:27.952 --> 05:31.372
<i>As Luca already identified,
you guys are going out into daylight...</i>

05:32.415 --> 05:35.001
<i>so at this point,
I heard the thermal hatches open.</i>

05:35.168 --> 05:37.003
Luca, you are go for egress.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.426
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:57.774 --> 06:01.569
<i>So, Luca, we're approaching
sunset here, just so you know.</i>

06:38.856 --> 06:41.567
<i>Put some tension on the reel
to help you figure it out.</i>

06:46.864 --> 06:48.950
<i>There's kind of an art to being
a ground IV.</i>

06:49.951 --> 06:52.453
<i>You... You wanna give them
all the information they need</i>

06:52.537 --> 06:53.704
<i>to never make a mistake.</i>

06:54.414 --> 06:57.291
And Drew, uh, do you know
where you're putting that red bag?

06:59.544 --> 07:01.295
<i>But you don't wanna give them
too much information,</i>

07:01.504 --> 07:03.172
<i>because then you're just drowning them
in noise.</i>

07:04.048 --> 07:07.093
<i>They're doing something really dangerous,
and you kinda gotta understand</i>

07:07.176 --> 07:10.638
what do they need right now
to make this go smoothly for them?

07:13.516 --> 07:14.517
<i>Okay, copy.</i>

07:19.480 --> 07:22.400
<i>Drew, Luca, this is Houston,
and you are ready to go.</i>

07:36.372 --> 07:38.791
This is Jessica.
We are ready for motion.

07:40.042 --> 07:41.752
<i>Copy, I'm ready for motion.</i>

07:45.506 --> 07:47.884
<i>All you have to do now is sit back
and enjoy the ride.</i>

07:53.806 --> 07:54.849
<i>Getting motion.</i>

07:57.518 --> 08:01.439
<i>The Canadarm is a robotic arm
that's on the outside of the space station</i>

08:01.522 --> 08:05.443
<i>that can be used to pick up
very large pieces of equipment,</i>

08:06.110 --> 08:08.988
<i>as well as flying the spacewalkers
around the space station.</i>

08:20.333 --> 08:22.335
<i>Normally when we're flying the arm around,</i>

08:22.418 --> 08:25.046
<i>we'll be using external cameras
on the space station.</i>

08:25.963 --> 08:28.174
<i>But during this operation for the AMS,</i>

08:28.257 --> 08:31.928
<i>we had to completely re-envision
how we were flying the arm</i>

08:32.011 --> 08:35.264
<i>because of the geometry
of where the AMS is located.</i>

08:38.643 --> 08:42.271
<i>Okay, Luca, we are still in course
and this is going to be three minutes.</i>

08:45.107 --> 08:48.069
I didn't have a view through a window.
I didn't have a view through a camera.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.530
<i>Kind of flying in the blind.</i>

08:51.864 --> 08:54.158
<i>Hey, Luca, confirm you wanted
right 80 centimeters?</i>

08:56.827 --> 08:58.871
<i>And we're talking a 17-foot arm.</i>

08:59.080 --> 09:01.707
<i>If I were to drive the arm
in the wrong direction,</i>

09:01.791 --> 09:04.835
<i>then we could impact space station or AMS.</i>

09:06.587 --> 09:09.048
<i>When you're talking
about inches of clearance,</i>

09:09.173 --> 09:10.967
<i>that starts getting a little bit scary.</i>

09:11.717 --> 09:14.011
Okay, position hold there
and give us a minute,

09:14.095 --> 09:16.305
we're gonna get loaded
for the final show test.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.357
<i>Luca, looks like there's
an amazing view from where you are.</i>

09:26.440 --> 09:28.526
<i>Looking through your WVS, what do you see?</i>

09:42.915 --> 09:44.792
<i>Okay, we've stopped motion
and that's your published.</i>

09:45.376 --> 09:46.752
<i>Perfect, wow!</i>

10:05.021 --> 10:06.063
<i>Okay, Luca.</i>

10:06.981 --> 10:09.734
Your first task is the handling aid
for the...

10:36.927 --> 10:38.429
<i>Okay, that looks great.</i>

10:47.980 --> 10:49.774
<i>You're doing great Luca,
looks good.</i>

11:03.371 --> 11:07.458
<i>Okay, Luca. Now you're go
to remove those bolts with the blue tool.</i>

11:11.879 --> 11:15.091
<i>And Luca and Drew,
sun's gonna be coming up shortly here.</i>

11:34.360 --> 11:36.570
<i>Yeah, we see it floating there,
excellent work.</i>

11:53.713 --> 11:55.089
<i>Excellent work, Luca.</i>

11:56.882 --> 12:00.094
<i>And a reminder for everyone,
we're releasing the debris shield.</i>

12:01.053 --> 12:03.514
<i>This is something
we don't like to do.</i>

12:03.639 --> 12:05.474
<i>We only do it in extreme circumstances,</i>

12:05.808 --> 12:08.728
<i>because if you have a bad throw
you could hit something right away.</i>

12:09.520 --> 12:10.896
<i>But if you throw it
in the right direction,</i>

12:11.021 --> 12:14.233
<i>you can safely jettison
and this will burn up in the atmosphere,</i>

12:14.316 --> 12:17.194
<i>so that it doesn't come back
and hit space station one orbit later.</i>

12:17.987 --> 12:19.321
<i>EVA, you ready to jettison?</i>

12:19.405 --> 12:22.324
<i>Flight EVA, we are go as
long as we jettison ten degrees outboard.</i>

12:22.408 --> 12:23.409
Copy.

12:26.036 --> 12:28.289
<i>All right, Drew,
that's ten degrees outboard.</i>

12:32.334 --> 12:34.044
<i>If he snags it
as he's throwing it,</i>

12:34.128 --> 12:35.755
<i>he could actually throw it
into space station.</i>

12:35.838 --> 12:37.006
<i>We don't want him to do that.</i>

12:37.339 --> 12:41.093
<i>So his job is just to throw it
straight away from him.</i>

12:49.518 --> 12:51.270
<i>Okay, you are go.</i>

12:51.353 --> 12:52.438
<i>Here's the big pitch.</i>

12:58.778 --> 12:59.862
<i>He's go.</i>

13:01.447 --> 13:02.782
<i>Okay, you are go.</i>

13:03.449 --> 13:04.867
<i>Toss this thing overboard.</i>

13:05.576 --> 13:08.412
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

13:36.899 --> 13:40.486
<i>Great pitch, Drew. Looks good.
Exactly what we wanted, excellent job.</i>

13:44.990 --> 13:48.077
<i>And the last few minutes
I've got with you here,</i>

13:48.285 --> 13:50.287
I gotta tell you,
you made the ground team

13:50.454 --> 13:54.458
awfully happy and proud of you guys today.
Just some excellent, excellent work.

13:57.878 --> 14:01.674
I was, like, glued to the TV
because I just wanted to...

14:02.675 --> 14:05.594
be in the moment with them
as all... as they were doing it.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.515
<i>I feel proud for Drew and Luca.</i>

14:10.224 --> 14:14.061
You can tell there's this welling
of happiness in the building right now.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.022
- And high five. Bye guys.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.315
- I'm gonna go...
Going home?

14:18.440 --> 14:19.608
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.319
There. Whoo!

14:23.821 --> 14:25.364
Right.
- Got the handrail working.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.908
All right. Well, I'll let you guys
get to it. Congratulations.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.035
<i>Not wanting to get too excited,</i>

14:30.160 --> 14:32.580
<i>because the team has
a challenge ahead of them</i>

14:32.663 --> 14:35.457
<i>in figuring out the timeline and the plan
for next week.</i>

14:36.625 --> 14:38.544
We still have
the real work ahead of us

14:38.627 --> 14:41.130
which is cutting open the tubes,
and that's where

14:41.672 --> 14:43.591
we'll make our money, so...

14:45.217 --> 14:47.803
How did it go?
I think it went amazing.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.223
I think it was outstanding.
Good!

14:51.348 --> 14:53.684
Everything is faster.
I thought it went well too.

14:54.852 --> 14:57.730
All right. Well, another job done.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.823
<i>Children,
ladies and gentlemen, there she is!</i>

15:08.198 --> 15:09.783
<i>The Grumman Tigercat.</i>

15:22.129 --> 15:23.505
<i>Have you been in these, flying?</i>

15:23.589 --> 15:24.882
Oh, yeah.
Yeah?

15:25.049 --> 15:26.383
I've parachuted out of this thing.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.719
It's kind of cool
we just get to walk up in here.

15:28.844 --> 15:29.845
Yeah.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.516
<i>Gonna call Mom?</i>
- All right, let's call Mom.

15:35.559 --> 15:36.602
<i>Hello?</i>

15:36.685 --> 15:38.437
Hey!
<i>Hi!</i>

15:39.146 --> 15:40.356
Found some cool news out.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.442
<i>Yeah. Okay. What?</i>

15:43.859 --> 15:45.361
I'm getting another chance
to go to space.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.988
<i>Oh, that is awesome!</i>
- Yeah!

15:48.072 --> 15:50.658
<i>That's exciting, that'll be...
Oh, what a thrill!</i>

15:50.741 --> 15:54.453
We're going to have a pre-launch party
at the JFK Library.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.498
<i>Oh, come on!</i>
- Yeah.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.166
<i>In Boston?</i>
Yeah, in Boston.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.502
<i>Oh my gosh.</i>
Won't that be fun?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.254
<i>Well, I don't know.
I'll see if I can... If I'm free.</i>

16:04.964 --> 16:08.634
<i>I'll have to check my schedule
and I'll pencil you in.</i>

16:09.885 --> 16:11.553
All right.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.436
<i>It was an exciting week.</i>

16:20.020 --> 16:22.481
<i>A seat has opened up
on the April Soyuz rocket.</i>

16:23.565 --> 16:27.194
<i>The AMS mission will be finished
and Luca will be home by then,</i>

16:27.611 --> 16:29.488
<i>but Drew and I will overlap for a week.</i>

16:36.745 --> 16:39.873
<i>So it's so cool to know
that I'm actually going back to space</i>

16:40.040 --> 16:42.167
and I just couldn't even believe it.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.587
<i>Good afternoon
and welcome to NASA's Johnson Space Center</i>

16:45.713 --> 16:49.133
and the Expedition 62/63
Crew News Conference.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.469
We are joined
by the Expedition 62/63 crew,

16:52.594 --> 16:57.391
Chris Cassidy, Nikolai Tikhonov,
and Andrei Babkin from Roscosmos.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.768
Yeah, Brandi,
great to be with you today

16:59.852 --> 17:02.604
and super exciting for the three of us
to be here.

17:02.771 --> 17:07.443
Obviously I'm Chris Cassidy
and a, um, proud member of NASA...

17:07.776 --> 17:10.904
<i>When Chris got bumped off
of the AMS mission,</i>

17:11.822 --> 17:13.198
I think that was really hard for him.

17:13.991 --> 17:19.038
<i>He is a stoic guy
and somebody who controls his emotions.</i>

17:19.913 --> 17:21.957
But yeah, I think...
I think that was difficult.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.919
<i>So, when he got that phone call,</i>

17:26.587 --> 17:32.593
it was super exciting and cool,
and I was just so psyched for him.

17:33.469 --> 17:37.014
So this is our... our first flight
and we are excited.

17:37.139 --> 17:40.142
We are waiting for this.
We were trained well for a long time.

17:40.476 --> 17:44.563
<i>I'm excited to be at this point.
The last time I flew was six years ago.</i>

17:45.189 --> 17:49.193
I feel like a little kid right now
with this cool feeling of... of

17:49.359 --> 17:51.153
"It's real. It's actually real."

17:51.320 --> 17:54.490
Astronaut and cosmonaut community
is a very small and tight-knit...

17:55.282 --> 17:56.825
<i>I am just a firm believer</i>

17:56.950 --> 17:59.787
<i>that everything in life
happens for a reason.</i>

18:01.622 --> 18:07.086
<i>I think that after waiting several years,
uh, to be able to launch again...</i>

18:08.337 --> 18:11.131
<i>you just get that excitement
moving inside of you.</i>

18:11.256 --> 18:12.758
Yeah. Ladies first.
That's right.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.844
<i>He loves it. He loves going into space.</i>

18:16.303 --> 18:21.141
<i>And so I think it's just real important
to him just to be able to do it again.</i>

18:40.119 --> 18:41.829
<i>Isn't it? Yeah.
I just wanted to say</i>

18:41.912 --> 18:43.831
- congratulations as well.
Thank you, yeah.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.749
- Congratulations.
- We already gave her a hug,

18:45.874 --> 18:47.751
- so...

18:48.377 --> 18:50.921
<i>It's been a dynamic year
for all of the crews involved</i>

18:51.046 --> 18:52.589
<i>with space station training,</i>

18:52.756 --> 18:56.009
<i>when launches will be.
And I was just, I don't know, relieved.</i>

18:56.301 --> 18:59.138
<i>Just, uh, happy that there's a decision.</i>

18:59.263 --> 19:00.597
All right.
- Okay.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.519
<i>But, you know, when you fly in space...</i>

19:06.979 --> 19:10.399
a large percentage of the mission
is who you fly in space with.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.533
<i>I've been training
with Nikolai and Andrei...</i>

19:24.663 --> 19:28.000
<i>and this time,
for the first time in my space career,</i>

19:28.083 --> 19:30.085
<i>I'll be the commander of the mission.</i>

19:30.335 --> 19:32.754
Hatches closed.
No two-aft hatch closed.

19:33.463 --> 19:36.258
<i>I have never been a commander
of a mission before in space.</i>

19:36.466 --> 19:38.177
<i>That is a... is a new event for me...</i>

19:38.302 --> 19:40.387
- We get all the lab equipment.
<i>Copy that, Chris.</i>

19:40.512 --> 19:42.681
<i>...and, uh, I'm really excited
about that.</i>

19:46.393 --> 19:50.814
<i>Nikolai will be the Soyuz Commander
and Andrei will be the Flight Engineer,</i>

19:51.190 --> 19:53.358
and it's their first flight
but they've been around,

19:53.442 --> 19:55.485
they've been cosmonauts for a long time.

19:55.903 --> 20:01.783
I think about ten years, uh,
so, seen many, many training sessions,

20:01.867 --> 20:05.078
<i>and the only thing they're missing is...
is a little bit of a real launch,</i>

20:05.454 --> 20:08.457
but, uh, really, really solid guys.

20:11.585 --> 20:15.088
You always need a good excuse
to cancel Russian class.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.258
<i>The three of us complement each other
really, really well.</i>

20:19.134 --> 20:24.097
<i>Nikolai, very talkative, funny,
has great jokes.</i>

20:25.307 --> 20:26.934
<i>Andrei, quiet.</i>

20:27.643 --> 20:30.395
<i>At first, I... I didn't appreciate
his sense of humor,</i>

20:30.479 --> 20:32.022
<i>but he is really, really funny.</i>

20:32.105 --> 20:34.233
Survival in the stone jungle!

20:34.316 --> 20:36.526
- Jungle.

20:36.610 --> 20:41.114
So, personalities, it matches
and we... we just click really well.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.825
It's fantastic to be a part of this group.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.619
- No flash?
No flash.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.412
No flash?
- One, two, three.

20:47.913 --> 20:51.416
<i>Myself and my two crewmates,
we're the next ones to leave the planet.</i>

21:06.265 --> 21:08.392
<i>And what I...
What you're saying is,</i>

21:08.892 --> 21:13.355
that we are going to discover the origins
of the universe by repairing AMS?

21:13.772 --> 21:15.524
- Yes, I think that's what we're saying.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.150
And if we don't, we'll never know?

21:19.027 --> 21:20.737
- That's actually...
- That's a lot of pressure.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.030
That's a lot of pressure.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.212
- Something...
- Something is wrong here.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.131
You have three options
over here, right?

21:45.137 --> 21:46.555
Jeremy Hansen, folks.

21:46.888 --> 21:47.973
She's off to...

21:55.397 --> 21:57.983
That happens every time.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.986
<i>Good morning, everybody.
Good morning, team.</i>

22:01.320 --> 22:03.655
Hey! Fantastic.
It's great to see you guys.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.616
So, we're just gonna
chair fly this right now

22:06.950 --> 22:08.827
and we'll go
through the common protocol, so...

22:08.994 --> 22:13.582
<i>That's it. I will confirm
or identify each tube</i>

22:13.707 --> 22:18.170
<i>before actually cutting and making sure
that everybody is happy with the wording.</i>

22:18.378 --> 22:21.548
Yeah, and so where
we've gone wrong with this before

22:21.757 --> 22:24.634
is when someone has taken
their eyes off the tubes

22:25.052 --> 22:28.847
and then gone back,
this is where we've cut the wrong tubes.

22:29.014 --> 22:32.934
So there's gonna be about three people
on the ground listening to that call

22:33.018 --> 22:36.229
and giving us a go,
before I give you a go to cut.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.858
So you don't cut until we... I say go.

22:40.108 --> 22:42.986
<i>I understand very well
that this is critical.</i>

22:43.320 --> 22:45.238
Yeah, no, we know you do,
that's perfect.

22:45.614 --> 22:46.615
Okay.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.012
<i>On this EVA,
one of the critical things</i>

23:09.096 --> 23:12.349
<i>is we have to cut
into these tiny little tubes</i>

23:12.432 --> 23:15.727
<i>and they're all stacked together.
There's ten of them on top of each other</i>

23:15.852 --> 23:19.272
<i>and it's actually really challenging
to tell them apart.</i>

23:21.066 --> 23:23.860
<i>The first spacewalk,
everything worked so flawlessly...</i>

23:26.363 --> 23:31.743
but now it is, uh, just a different level
of awareness and stress.

23:33.036 --> 23:35.831
<i>You know, my friends are gonna be outside
in the vacuum of space.</i>

23:35.914 --> 23:38.417
Their lives depend on A,
them doing it right,

23:38.500 --> 23:41.545
and B, us catching it on the ground
if they do make mistakes,

23:41.628 --> 23:42.712
because they do happen.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.466
<i>And so it... it is just a different level
of intensity</i>

23:46.550 --> 23:47.843
<i>and a different level of focus.</i>

23:49.886 --> 23:52.180
<i>Oxygen EMP one
and two valves are open.</i>

23:52.389 --> 23:54.891
<i>Okay, Luca and Drew.
Luca, you're go for egress.</i>

24:03.191 --> 24:06.570
<i>You know, we nicknamed it
the nail biter. Uh, we're cutting tubes.</i>

24:06.903 --> 24:09.948
In a lot of ways we're doing
open heart surgery on AMS,

24:10.157 --> 24:13.702
and you know, just like in surgery,
if you cut an artery,

24:13.910 --> 24:14.953
<i>there's no going back.</i>

24:28.717 --> 24:33.180
<i>Every single person working on
the development of the AMS procedures</i>

24:33.472 --> 24:36.057
<i>at one point cut the wrong tube.</i>

24:38.018 --> 24:40.479
<i>I know Chris cut the wrong tube, Jeremy,</i>

24:40.770 --> 24:43.857
<i>every person in that...
in this suit cut the wrong tube.</i>

24:44.858 --> 24:46.776
<i>There is no space for mistakes.</i>

24:48.987 --> 24:53.241
<i>Luca Parmitano is gonna be doing
the role of the actual surgery itself.</i>

24:54.075 --> 24:56.077
<i>Drew Morgan will be
a kind of surgical nurse,</i>

24:56.161 --> 24:58.413
<i>make sure the right tools
are configured the right way</i>

24:58.497 --> 25:00.290
<i>and handed to Luca at the right time.</i>

25:02.083 --> 25:04.002
<i>Every time you open one
of these bags...</i>

25:05.003 --> 25:07.547
<i>the tools, they just want to come outside.</i>

25:07.756 --> 25:10.634
<i>And once they come out
and start floating it's...</i>

25:11.426 --> 25:13.053
<i>It is a kelp forest.</i>

25:14.221 --> 25:17.182
<i>You have to meticulously
separate everything</i>

25:17.349 --> 25:21.353
<i>so that... so that it doesn't get tangled
and become an impossible mess.</i>

25:23.772 --> 25:27.817
<i>Drew and I actually have
an unspoken code where if we say,</i>

25:27.901 --> 25:29.110
<i>"I'm working on it,"</i>

25:29.569 --> 25:34.574
it actually means "I'm in trouble,
I'm very frustrated, I need more time."

25:35.075 --> 25:37.494
<i>So if I say, "Hey,
how are we doing with that tool?"</i>

25:38.203 --> 25:40.580
<i>I'm working on it.
Working on it.</i>

25:40.705 --> 25:43.166
Mm-hmm.

25:43.917 --> 25:46.253
<i>And that's all we needed
between the two of us.</i>

25:49.214 --> 25:50.882
<i>Luca and Drew, let's get to work.</i>

25:52.384 --> 25:57.138
<i>So first step is identifying
tube nadir upper one.</i>

26:11.236 --> 26:12.654
<i>That should be fourth
from the vacuum case</i>

26:12.779 --> 26:15.115
<i>-and one down from the middle.
- It's fourth from the vacuum case.</i>

26:15.240 --> 26:17.701
Yes, APO, that's not what we have,
it's four down from the vacuum case,

26:17.784 --> 26:19.286
- one down from the middle.
<i>Okay.</i>

26:20.579 --> 26:22.539
All right, IV, let's have them wait.
We need to have a conversation

26:22.622 --> 26:23.915
before we cut the tube here.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.503
<i>Okay. We're not cutting yet,
we're gonna pause here for a second, Luca.</i>

26:28.670 --> 26:33.550
<i>So do whatever you need to do to make sure
we have identified on the correct tube,</i>

26:33.633 --> 26:35.594
we're just giving it
a little bit more time.

26:37.345 --> 26:38.388
<i>Copy.</i>

26:50.025 --> 26:52.861
<i>Well, say the words one more time
and then I'll give you the final go.</i>

26:58.783 --> 27:00.118
<i>Yeah, you guys happy
with the words?</i>

27:00.327 --> 27:01.369
<i>We're good.</i>

27:07.500 --> 27:08.710
<i>EVA, does that look correct?</i>

27:10.170 --> 27:11.755
<i>We concur, flight.
Okay.</i>

27:12.005 --> 27:14.049
<i>IV, we're go for him
to cut the tubes.</i>

27:15.800 --> 27:17.761
<i>Luca, you are go,
that is the correct tube.</i>

27:40.617 --> 27:42.035
<i>He's got it. Correct.</i>

27:42.243 --> 27:44.996
<i>It's a good cut.
Okay, good work, Luca.</i>

27:49.250 --> 27:50.251
No.

27:51.044 --> 27:54.130
We've had many times in the NBL
where they've cut the wrong one.

28:02.180 --> 28:06.393
<i>Okay, Luca, you can identify
nadir lower three.</i>

28:19.781 --> 28:21.658
EVO cannot read that call.

28:23.952 --> 28:24.994
<i>We'll get it again.</i>

28:25.286 --> 28:26.579
<i>Yeah, and IV, let's tell them</i>

28:26.663 --> 28:29.416
<i>we didn't hear the whole thing, if we can
ask him to give it to us again please.</i>

28:29.499 --> 28:31.042
All right, read it to us
one more time, Luca,

28:31.126 --> 28:32.502
and we'll give you the go.

28:45.932 --> 28:47.892
<i>One down from the middle,
one up from bottom.</i>

28:48.017 --> 28:49.102
<i>EVO concurs.</i>

28:49.769 --> 28:51.771
<i>Okay. All right. EVA?</i>

28:52.731 --> 28:54.941
<i>EVA concurs.
IV, he's good to cut it.</i>

28:55.275 --> 28:57.569
Luca, that is correct.
You are go to cut that tube.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.543
<i>That's the last one.</i>

29:17.422 --> 29:18.715
<i>Okay. That's the right one.</i>

29:27.640 --> 29:30.268
<i>Okay.
We got the really hard task done,</i>

29:30.351 --> 29:32.479
<i>-the ones we were concerned about.</i>
- Okay!

29:37.025 --> 29:39.319
<i>Yeah. Well, we don't wanna
give you an easy job.</i>

29:40.028 --> 29:43.406
<i>Okay, that wraps it up, Luca.
Yeah, take yourself home.</i>

29:43.740 --> 29:47.660
<i>And to all of you up there,
thanks again for another incredible EVA.</i>

29:58.338 --> 30:01.424
<i>The first EVA had gone so smoothly
and was so successful,</i>

30:01.758 --> 30:05.720
<i>I had even said, you know,
we might have to be careful of complacency</i>

30:05.804 --> 30:07.388
<i>because there's no guarantee</i>

30:07.472 --> 30:09.766
<i>that every EVA is gonna continue
to go like this.</i>

30:10.225 --> 30:14.020
<i>The training paid off
with us knowing exactly</i>

30:14.145 --> 30:15.396
<i>what we were going to do.</i>

30:17.315 --> 30:22.195
We cut the lines on the tracker
so the AMS entire experiment

30:22.320 --> 30:23.780
<i>is now shut off.</i>

30:24.489 --> 30:26.449
<i>But if we keep on this way,</i>

30:26.574 --> 30:28.910
<i>we're gonna have great success
in finishing this.</i>

30:30.370 --> 30:32.831
<i>Everybody's happy.
Everything was done properly,</i>

30:32.914 --> 30:35.083
<i>cut all the right tubes,
all the right sides</i>

30:35.208 --> 30:36.793
<i>and so, uh, we're in good shape.</i>

30:59.357 --> 31:05.154
We have a fire,
or, we have a smoke alarm...

31:07.115 --> 31:09.742
Mm-hmm.
-...in the Functional Cargo Block

31:10.326 --> 31:11.411
Sensor...

31:13.121 --> 31:14.080
One to six...

31:14.706 --> 31:16.624
Sensors one to six and one to seven...

31:16.749 --> 31:19.085
<i>We're flying in a Soyuz,</i>

31:19.294 --> 31:22.171
<i>and that means
that when you don the headset,</i>

31:22.422 --> 31:24.716
<i>the people you're speaking to
are speaking in Russian.</i>

31:24.841 --> 31:26.259
<i>When you're looking at the panel,</i>

31:26.426 --> 31:29.429
<i>all of the displays
and all of the switches, all in Russian.</i>

31:29.512 --> 31:31.514
A6...

31:33.474 --> 31:35.184
is located...

31:35.435 --> 31:36.978
- Or is it "are"?
- Is. Is located.

31:37.186 --> 31:41.357
<i>Every single set
of lessons culminates with an oral exam</i>

31:41.441 --> 31:45.236
<i>with a group of engineers
and specialists on that system.</i>

31:45.361 --> 31:47.113
<i>So you..
you can't bluff your way through it.</i>

31:47.196 --> 31:48.990
<i>You really need to know
what you're talking about.</i>

31:49.490 --> 31:50.658
The r-e...

31:51.326 --> 31:54.454
- r-e-d...
- No. It should be "readings" here.

31:54.662 --> 31:55.830
This is a mistake.

31:55.955 --> 31:56.915
The readings.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.333
Yeah, that's what I thought.
- Mm-hmm.

31:58.416 --> 31:59.542
Yes. The readings.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.794
That's a small victory, I knew that was...

32:01.920 --> 32:03.296
- A mistake! You knew it!
Yeah!

32:03.463 --> 32:05.506
Yes, a hero!
- I'm a hero!

32:05.673 --> 32:08.593
- It's a big achievement! Very well done!

32:08.927 --> 32:10.803
<i>We're one crew, we're one team.</i>

32:11.262 --> 32:14.724
<i>So it ups my game to try to speak
to them in Russian.</i>

32:15.141 --> 32:18.102
Sometimes I fail at that,
but I'm always trying.

32:19.604 --> 32:22.231
<i>But there's so many aspects</i>

32:22.315 --> 32:24.442
<i>to a six month mission
on the space station.</i>

32:27.570 --> 32:31.950
<i>The International Space Station
is an orbital laboratory.</i>

32:38.915 --> 32:41.834
<i>It really is about two things.
Making life on Earth better...</i>

32:42.335 --> 32:43.336
<i>And Luca,</i>

32:43.419 --> 32:45.296
<i>for the next activity,
we're gonna try to...</i>

32:45.546 --> 32:48.549
<i>...and enabling us
to go beyond low-Earth orbit.</i>

32:52.136 --> 32:55.556
Okay. This is the veggie experiment,
growing plants in space.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.935
The great thing about this payload
or this experiment,

32:59.102 --> 33:01.604
is that when we're all done,
we get to eat this.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.732
<i>When we were there six years ago,</i>

33:05.024 --> 33:07.860
<i>we were not running
nearly the number of experiments</i>

33:07.944 --> 33:09.112
<i>that are happening now.</i>

33:10.113 --> 33:13.574
<i>And now it's like non-stop,
so that's exciting.</i>

33:15.159 --> 33:16.160
Right here.

33:16.244 --> 33:17.870
Of course here, we would see that it's...

33:18.162 --> 33:19.163
- The thing is...
- On the bottom?

33:19.288 --> 33:21.833
On the bottom.
On orbit it's not at the bottom because...

33:22.000 --> 33:24.752
So our mission will be to go
to the space station for six months,

33:25.211 --> 33:26.838
and conduct science and research,

33:27.547 --> 33:30.383
<i>and I'll be the specialist
for the US side of the space station.</i>

33:31.384 --> 33:35.805
<i>The US side includes the Canadian,
Japanese and European Space agencies...</i>

33:37.056 --> 33:39.976
<i>and you just learn the nuances of...
of each module</i>

33:40.101 --> 33:41.352
<i>when you go to those countries.</i>

33:43.896 --> 33:45.523
- Oh my God!
- These things...

33:45.606 --> 33:47.525
We would like to thank...

33:48.317 --> 33:52.572
the wonderful producers of these fruits
and vegetables from Japan.

33:52.739 --> 33:55.408
We'd like to say
<i>domo arigato gozaimashita.</i>

33:55.575 --> 33:58.703
<i>-Arigato gozaimasu.
- Domo arigato gozaimasu.</i>

33:59.871 --> 34:01.664
<i>Is it an inspiring program
to be a part of?</i>

34:01.789 --> 34:03.082
<i>Absolutely, no question.</i>

34:03.249 --> 34:08.171
Any... Any endeavor that brings together
multiple cultures, multiple nations

34:08.588 --> 34:11.841
<i>to conduct one mission, unified, is...</i>

34:12.258 --> 34:14.010
can only be inspirational.

34:28.566 --> 34:32.111
<i>Jeff Radigan was the on-console
flight director for the first two EVAs</i>

34:32.236 --> 34:34.322
<i>and then I'll take
the third and fourth EVAs.</i>

34:34.614 --> 34:36.491
Every EVA has its own flavor,

34:36.574 --> 34:41.037
and these have been fun,
and so I'm planning for success

34:41.120 --> 34:42.705
and ready for surprises.

34:46.584 --> 34:48.628
<i>I've led five different expeditions.</i>

34:49.670 --> 34:52.256
<i>Since the first woman
became a flight director,</i>

34:52.924 --> 34:55.301
<i>we've been in about 16 so far.</i>

34:55.426 --> 34:56.427
<i>Turn it to one,</i>

34:56.594 --> 34:59.263
<i>we would like you to go back
to GPC on the S-band.</i>

34:59.514 --> 35:02.517
No. It's not NSP,
it's Antenna Pointing Electronics.

35:02.850 --> 35:05.436
That's another LRU in the com system.

35:06.020 --> 35:09.273
And he should go back to GPC
on antenna pointing.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.109
And that should work.

35:16.781 --> 35:19.242
<i>I have seen the women
who came before me,</i>

35:19.367 --> 35:21.702
<i>and have talked to them
and heard their stories,</i>

35:21.786 --> 35:24.664
and heard that it wasn't necessarily
the easiest thing in the world

35:24.789 --> 35:25.957
for them to...

35:27.542 --> 35:29.961
to break into that "all-male" world.

35:31.337 --> 35:35.591
<i>But it's always about what you're able
to bring to the team here.</i>

35:37.218 --> 35:40.596
If you bring what the team needs,
then that's what's valued.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.559
Okay. Let's not get ahead of ourselves,
we've got some more work to do.

35:47.395 --> 35:51.315
<i>Emily just made a good point here,
that, uh, we've... we've completed</i>

35:51.399 --> 35:53.442
<i>the demolition phase of AMS repair</i>

35:53.526 --> 35:56.237
<i>and now we're in the construction phase
of AMS.</i>

35:57.113 --> 35:58.739
<i>So no more throwing things overboard.</i>

36:01.576 --> 36:02.827
<i>I'll keep that in mind.</i>

36:06.914 --> 36:10.209
<i>So EVA3 is when we bring
the box out, the UTTPS,</i>

36:10.459 --> 36:13.880
<i>and make all the connections,
clean cutting and swaging.</i>

36:14.338 --> 36:16.340
<i>So, swaging is when we take
the two tubes,</i>

36:16.632 --> 36:18.092
<i>and we have to put them together,</i>

36:18.176 --> 36:20.219
<i>and make sure
that they're leak-proof in space,</i>

36:20.511 --> 36:23.639
<i>and that's kind of been one of
the big cruxes of this EVA series,</i>

36:23.764 --> 36:28.352
<i>is coming up with that tool system,
this AAF, that can do the swages in space.</i>

36:30.229 --> 36:31.355
These are brand new tools.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.816
All these things we just don't know
what we're gonna find.

36:36.652 --> 36:39.322
<i>Luca, your next job
is don't let go of the box,</i>

36:39.405 --> 36:41.032
<i>and enjoy the view.</i>

36:42.366 --> 36:43.409
<i>You're on your way.</i>

36:47.413 --> 36:49.207
<i>The crew has worked so hard
to get to this point,</i>

36:49.290 --> 36:52.001
<i>and they are the ones
ultimately making the calls on,</i>

36:52.168 --> 36:56.130
<i>"Is this okay? Is this not okay?"
We have to rely on them so much.</i>

36:56.380 --> 36:59.050
<i>Their eyes are much better
than our drawings,</i>

36:59.425 --> 37:02.678
<i>our plans, our pictures,
all the stuff that we have on the ground.</i>

37:03.054 --> 37:05.681
Ultimately, it's going to be their eyes
looking at this and saying,

37:06.098 --> 37:07.850
"Yeah, I think we can do this,"
or, "I can't."

37:11.062 --> 37:13.981
<i>Okay, that looks good.
You're go to swage.</i>

37:21.822 --> 37:23.241
<i>Okay. Number five.</i>

37:34.877 --> 37:37.004
It didn't look like he tightened it
very hard that time.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.673
it just looked like fingertips.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.427
<i>Just make sure on
that VLI you tighten it</i>

37:43.511 --> 37:45.429
<i>to a high torque value by hand.</i>

37:51.978 --> 37:54.272
<i>Yep, no problem,
we just want to double check.</i>

37:54.647 --> 37:55.856
<i>We trust you.</i>

37:57.024 --> 37:58.109
<i>Copy.</i>

38:00.903 --> 38:02.071
<i>Okay. Looks like it's complete.</i>

38:02.863 --> 38:03.864
<i>Copy.</i>

38:05.241 --> 38:08.327
<i>Drew and Luca, we are, uh,
we're in good shape here.</i>

38:08.452 --> 38:10.538
<i>We've got everything done here
that we... we planned to get done.</i>

38:11.247 --> 38:12.873
<i>Okay. Yeah. We're gonna come inside.</i>

38:12.999 --> 38:16.252
<i>I've just got to catch up with you guys
on your safety, um, tether.</i>

38:17.211 --> 38:20.506
<i>This team is phenomenal,
top... from top to bottom.</i>

38:21.841 --> 38:24.719
<i>Building all of the tools,
solving the problems that we've found.</i>

38:25.261 --> 38:30.182
<i>Incorporating, kind of, the craziness
of AMS into their very, very busy plan</i>

38:30.308 --> 38:34.103
without sacrificing all the rest
of the research we have going on onboard.

38:34.228 --> 38:36.022
Um, this team has been incredible.

38:37.857 --> 38:42.737
<i>Today was really a big day.
It all went just surprisingly smooth,</i>

38:43.404 --> 38:47.783
and come back in a few weeks
and do AMS, uh, EVA number four,

38:48.242 --> 38:49.243
and that'll be it.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.579
And then we'll be able to operate
the entire experiment again.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.310
Oh my gosh, check you guys out.

39:17.521 --> 39:18.564
Hi, Mom.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.817
Oh my God, there's Heather.

39:21.984 --> 39:23.402
- Yeah.
- How are you?

39:23.569 --> 39:24.820
So glad you guys are here.

39:24.945 --> 39:26.364
- Happy birthday, by the way.
Thank you.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.324
Happy birthday.
Thanks a lot, man.

39:31.619 --> 39:32.661
You've met Peggy.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.663
- So, you have not. Jamie.
- Hi, Jamie.

39:35.664 --> 39:37.917
<i>It's hitting in
that it's getting close.</i>

39:38.000 --> 39:42.254
In fact, both of us have mentally
had this launch party

39:42.505 --> 39:46.133
as, like, a checkpoint
where it's gonna start going fast,

39:46.217 --> 39:47.676
and we were talking
about that this morning like,

39:47.760 --> 39:48.928
"Okay, here we go. Are you ready?"

39:49.470 --> 39:51.764
Uh, but yeah,
we're both excited, both ready.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.516
Oh my God, cheers.

39:56.727 --> 40:00.564
This is kind of the last part
of this, you know, whole thing,

40:00.689 --> 40:04.402
and, yeah, so now the whole launch
becomes very real at this point.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.947
<i>It's really happening fast.</i>

40:08.322 --> 40:09.907
I'm so happy that you guys are here.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.868
<i>It's just gonna be
a series of quick trips.</i>

40:13.661 --> 40:17.081
We were in the SEAL Teams long time ago.
That was many inches on his waist.

40:17.289 --> 40:21.168
<i>And, uh, and then I'll be packing
my bags for good to head off.</i>

40:22.711 --> 40:24.505
- How are you? Yeah.
Lou, my man!

40:24.630 --> 40:26.132
- How you doing, buddy?
Good to see you.

40:26.215 --> 40:27.299
Lisa. Oh my God!

40:31.720 --> 40:32.763
- Oh my gosh.
- Oh my God.

40:32.888 --> 40:34.348
- Isn't this is awesome.
What do you think?

40:34.432 --> 40:35.766
- Is it going for you?
- Yeah!

40:36.016 --> 40:37.893
- Isn't this fun?
It's blowing me away, babe.

40:38.018 --> 40:40.271
- I know.
It's almost too much for me.

40:40.354 --> 40:42.356
- It is too much. It's emotional, isn't it?
Like...

40:42.440 --> 40:43.983
- Peggy, oh my God. I love you.
- I love you.

40:44.525 --> 40:47.111
Yeah. It's... It's fun. This is fun.

40:48.779 --> 40:49.989
Hello, can you hear me?

40:50.156 --> 40:51.240
Yes.

40:51.532 --> 40:54.076
You can.
Holy cow, it's a booming microphone.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.121
I need one of my SEAL friends
to go over there

40:57.204 --> 40:58.956
and grab the guys from the bar and...

40:59.123 --> 41:00.666
Those are your SEAL friends
at the bar!

41:00.791 --> 41:02.460
Those are my SEAL friends at the bar.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.630
So, to have all of you here...

41:07.840 --> 41:09.675
is just amazing to me.

41:10.718 --> 41:14.221
I've heard it said before
that one never really knows

41:14.597 --> 41:18.184
the value of a moment until it's a memory.

41:18.767 --> 41:21.395
But tonight, I beg to differ,

41:21.479 --> 41:25.733
because I truly appreciate
the value of this moment

41:25.816 --> 41:28.235
in having each and every one of you here.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.988
<i>What's the probability of a kid
from New York,</i>

41:31.071 --> 41:33.532
throwing a NERF football
around in my backyard with my brother,

41:33.782 --> 41:38.162
would end up here at the JFK Library
for a pre-launch party to space?

41:38.287 --> 41:40.581
<i>I mean, it just blows my mind
when I think about that.</i>

41:42.208 --> 41:45.961
<i>I've learned that you never really know
what's behind the next door.</i>

41:46.504 --> 41:49.089
You really don't know what impact
you are gonna have

41:49.173 --> 41:52.885
or what impact somebody else
is gonna have on... on your life.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.598
And finally, the last thing
I have to share with you

41:57.681 --> 42:01.644
is... is very personal
and a bit of a secret.

42:02.394 --> 42:03.771
Do you wanna know the secret?

42:04.063 --> 42:05.314
We do, yes.

42:05.648 --> 42:06.690
Well...

42:07.399 --> 42:11.278
today's January 4th,
and just four days ago,

42:11.362 --> 42:15.157
five days ago, I guess, on New Year's Eve,
Peggy and I were married.

42:25.668 --> 42:29.380
- My God, man.
- This is so crazy for me.

42:29.463 --> 42:31.632
Oh, what a good kept secret
you had.

42:31.757 --> 42:33.717
- Very well-kept secret, right?
- Yes!

42:35.302 --> 42:37.388
Birthday and wedding!
Yeah, I won the lottery.

42:37.638 --> 42:38.931
<i>He managed to pack an awful lot</i>

42:39.056 --> 42:40.057
<i>-into December.
Yeah.</i>

42:40.266 --> 42:42.810
I think he'll breathe
a sigh of relief when...

42:42.977 --> 42:44.937
- When he gets to space.
- Yeah.

42:46.522 --> 42:47.773
He'll be like, "Oh!"

42:47.856 --> 42:50.859
<i>I don't know, we're only, what,
four days in?</i>

42:51.068 --> 42:55.447
It's great. Yeah. No. It's great.
It was a perfect moment, perfect day.

42:56.532 --> 42:57.783
<i>I love him very much.</i>

42:59.618 --> 43:01.161
<i>Everything works out for a reason.</i>

43:01.245 --> 43:04.456
<i>Like, I was supposed to be right here
at this time.</i>

43:05.624 --> 43:07.626
<i>I was supposed to be on this mission...</i>

43:08.877 --> 43:10.838
<i>but you just never know.</i>

43:11.589 --> 43:14.550
You never know who and when
you're gonna get to space with

43:14.633 --> 43:16.468
until the rocket lights.
