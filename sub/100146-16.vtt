COACH WILSON: WHAT A GAME!

00:38.700 --> 00:41.870
I'LL LET COACH KELLY KNOW
THAT SPENCER JAMES IS BACK.

00:43.770 --> 00:45.610
BILLY: I THOUGHT
THAT WAS YOU.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.940
HOW COME YOU AIN'T
CELEBRATING WITH
THE REST OF THE TEAM?

00:48.980 --> 00:52.180
I'LL CELEBRATE
WITH THEM AT THE END
OF THE YEAR GALA.

00:52.210 --> 00:53.620
OK.

00:53.650 --> 00:55.050
RIGHT NOW I
JUST WANTED--

00:55.080 --> 00:57.120
WANTED THE PEACE
AND QUIET.

00:57.150 --> 00:59.090
YEAH.

01:04.190 --> 01:08.260
17-35, LOSS,
UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.870
THE GRASS WAS STILL WET
FROM WHEN IT RAINED
THAT MORNING.

01:11.900 --> 01:16.140
THAT WAS THE FIRST GAME
AFTER MY MOM'S PASSING.

01:16.170 --> 01:19.670
I REMEMBER EVERY DETAIL
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY

01:19.710 --> 01:23.750
JUST LIKE I REMEMBER
MY FIRST DATE
AFTER SHE PASSED,

01:23.780 --> 01:26.210
MY FIRST THANKSGIVING,

01:26.250 --> 01:29.150
MY FIRST TIME
BACK HOME AGAIN.

01:29.180 --> 01:33.060
WELCOME TO A YEAR
OF FIRSTS, SON.

01:35.090 --> 01:37.760
DOES IT, UM...

01:37.790 --> 01:39.830
DOES IT GET EASIER?

01:39.860 --> 01:41.830
YEAH, IT WILL.

01:41.860 --> 01:43.670
TREY: LOOKS LIKE I MADE
THE RIGHT CALL

01:43.700 --> 01:45.200
OKing YOU TO PLAY, SPENCER.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.870
CONGRATS ON
THE JAMBOREE WIN.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.900
UH, THANK YOU,
MR. HART.

01:49.940 --> 01:52.710
BILLY, LET'S TALK.

01:52.740 --> 01:54.710
WHAT'S GOING ON,
COACH?

01:56.080 --> 01:58.250
TREY: PART OF
THE INVESTIGATION
WILL INCLUDE--

01:58.280 --> 02:00.120
YOU MEAN WITCH HUNT,
RIGHT?

02:00.150 --> 02:02.150
I MEAN, 'CAUSE
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

02:02.180 --> 02:03.650
AS ATHLETIC DIRECTOR,
IT'S MY JOB TO LOOK
INTO THINGS

02:03.690 --> 02:05.350
THAT PUT OUR PROGRAM
AT RISK.

02:05.390 --> 02:07.990
YOU LIED ABOUT
ASHER ADAMS
USING STEROIDS.

02:08.020 --> 02:10.760
NOW, UNDERSTANDABLY,
THE BOOSTERS,
THE ADMINISTRATION

02:10.790 --> 02:12.890
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
WHAT ELSE YOU'VE DONE
OVER YOUR TIME HERE.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.200
OH, THAT'S FUNNY
TO YOU.

02:16.230 --> 02:20.700
LAST SEMESTER, I SUSPEND
ASHER BECAUSE HE WAS
DRUNK AT HOMECOMING,

02:20.740 --> 02:22.370
AND Y'ALL WANTED TO DAMN
NEAR BURN ME AT THE STAKE.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.670
THIS TIME, I'M TRYING TO
CUT THE KID A BREAK,

02:24.710 --> 02:27.710
AND YOU AND YOUR
MOB BOOSTERS ARE
COMING FOR MY JOB?

02:27.740 --> 02:29.780
THOSE TWO INCIDENTS ARE
NOT COMPARABLE, BILLY.

02:29.810 --> 02:31.210
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST ADMIT IT?

02:31.250 --> 02:32.450
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ASHER

02:32.480 --> 02:34.420
AND EVERYTHING
TO DO WITH THE FACT

02:34.450 --> 02:37.090
THAT YOUR BOOSTERS
CAN'T CONTROL THE WAY
I RUN MY TEAM.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.920
MOVING ON.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.020
THE INVESTIGATION
WILL ALSO INCLUDE

02:41.060 --> 02:43.390
TALKING TO YOUR
ASSISTANT COACHES AS
WELL AS YOUR PLAYERS.

02:43.420 --> 02:46.930
SO IF THERE ARE
ANY OTHER SKELETONS
IN YOUR CLOSET,

02:46.960 --> 02:49.260
SPEAK NOW.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.040
NICE. LAST ONE.

03:02.410 --> 03:05.180
ALL RIGHT. I'VE GOT
GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS.

03:05.210 --> 03:07.880
WHATEVER IT IS,
JUST TELL ME, PLEASE.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.020
WELL, I'LL START
WITH THE BAD.

03:10.050 --> 03:11.920
LOOKS LIKE THIS
WILL BE THE END
OF OUR TIME TOGETHER.

03:11.950 --> 03:13.460
YOUR SHOULDER'S
COMPLETELY HEALED.

03:13.490 --> 03:15.720
YOU'RE BACK TO YOUR
OLD SELF, SPENCER JAMES.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.260
IF THERE WAS ANY
RESIDUAL NERVE DAMAGE,
WE'D KNOW BY NOW.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.730
ESPECIALLY GIVEN
THE INTENSITY OF
THE JAMBOREE GAMES,

03:20.760 --> 03:22.460
YOU'D HAVE NECK PAIN,
AGGRESSIVE
MUSCLE WEAKNESS,

03:22.500 --> 03:24.170
FULL NUMBNESS IN
YOUR HAND,

03:24.200 --> 03:26.500
NONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE,

03:26.530 --> 03:30.240
ALTHOUGH I WOULD'VE
SWORN I'D GET A SLIGHTLY
MORE EXCITED RESPONSE.

03:30.270 --> 03:32.870
I'M SORRY.
I AM EXCITED.

03:32.910 --> 03:35.880
IT'S JUST IT'S--

03:35.910 --> 03:37.480
IT'S MY YEAR OF FIRSTS.

03:39.410 --> 03:42.780
OK, AND THE FOLLOWING
TUESDAY?

03:42.820 --> 03:44.320
OK. UH, JUST PLEASE
LET ME KNOW

03:44.350 --> 03:46.250
IF SOMETHING
OPENS UP. THANKS.

03:46.290 --> 03:48.020
-HEY.
-HEY.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.430
ANY LUCK BOOKING VENUES
FOR COOP'S TOUR THIS SUMMER?

03:50.460 --> 03:52.230
MOST OF THE SLOTS
ARE ALREADY FILLED.

03:52.260 --> 03:54.100
DID YOU TELL 'EM
WHO YOU ARE?

03:54.130 --> 03:55.930
NO. I DON'T WANT
TO GET THIS

03:55.960 --> 03:57.500
'CAUSE I'M
J.P. KEATING'S DAUGHTER.

03:57.530 --> 03:59.930
I NEED TO DO THIS
ON MY OWN.

03:59.970 --> 04:01.870
WELL, I CAN RESPECT THAT.

04:01.900 --> 04:04.510
MMM! SAUSAGE PANCAKES
WITH A SIDE OF BACON?

04:04.540 --> 04:07.140
OH. I ALREADY GOT US
THE EGG WHITE SCRAMBLE
WITH EXTRA AVOCADO.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.410
SOUNDS EXTRA BORING.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.350
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
EAT CRAP ON TOUR.

04:11.380 --> 04:13.150
I'M JUST TRYING
TO SQUEEZE IN
SOME HEALTHY FOOD

04:13.180 --> 04:14.850
BEFORE YOU GO.

04:17.150 --> 04:19.320
HEY.

04:19.350 --> 04:21.060
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU,

04:21.090 --> 04:23.490
BUT COOP'S TOUR SHOULD KEEP
YOU BUSY WHILE I'M GONE.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.860
YEAH. EVERYTHING'S
GOING BACK TO NORMAL.

04:26.890 --> 04:28.160
NORMAL'S GOOD?

04:28.200 --> 04:30.470
NORMAL'S GREAT.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.200
OLIVIA: OK...

04:35.240 --> 04:37.970
IMPROMPTU FAMILY
MEETINGS NEVER REALLY
GO WELL FOR US.

04:38.010 --> 04:40.210
SO JUST RIP
THE BAND-AID OFF, DAD.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.810
BILLY: OK. I'M MOVING OUT.

04:46.350 --> 04:48.050
OLIVIA: WAIT. YOU'RE
LEAVING US AGAIN?

04:48.080 --> 04:50.320
THIS IS NOTHING LIKE
LAST TIME.

04:50.350 --> 04:52.320
I LEASED A NICE
CONDO THAT'S JUST
A COUPLE OF MILES AWAY.

04:52.350 --> 04:54.390
SO I'M GONNA BE AROUND.
I'M GONNA BE AROUND A LOT.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.830
JORDAN: IS THIS BECAUSE OF
THE INVESTIGATION AT SCHOOL?

04:56.860 --> 04:59.060
ARE YOU LEAVING TO
PROTECT US FROM
SOMETHING THAT'S COMING?

04:59.090 --> 05:00.400
NO, NO, NO, NO.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.030
THE TRUTH IS,
YOUR MOTHER AND I,

05:02.060 --> 05:04.370
WE HAVE BEEN SEPARATED
FOR A WHILE NOW.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.900
AND MOVING FORWARD
IS WHAT'S BEST

05:07.940 --> 05:09.970
FOR THE FAMILY,
RIGHT, LAURA?

05:13.270 --> 05:15.340
RIGHT, YEAH.

05:15.380 --> 05:19.280
BILLY: RIGHT. SO...YEAH.

05:22.980 --> 05:24.120
OK.

05:24.150 --> 05:26.390
OK.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.890
THANK YOU.

05:31.930 --> 05:33.330
UH, I CALL DIBS ON
THE BIGGER ROOM.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.260
MM-MM. NOPE.
IN YOUR DREAMS.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.130
OLIVIA: WHAT?
JORDAN: GET OUT OF HERE.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.430
-LOVE YOU, DAD.
-I LOVE YOU, TOO, MAN.

05:41.070 --> 05:43.200
OLIVIA: LOVE YOU, DAD.
BILLY: LOVE YOU, OLIVIA.

05:43.240 --> 05:47.580
♪ ALL MY LIFE, I READ
BETWEEN THE LINES... ♪

05:47.610 --> 05:50.480
POPS, WHAT DID YOU DO
TO PISS OFF THESE BIRDS?

05:50.510 --> 05:54.350
I LITERALLY CLEANED THIS,
LIKE, TWO DAYS AGO. DAMN.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.550
HEY. WE WON THE JAMBOREE
YESTERDAY.

05:58.590 --> 06:01.260
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.
IT FELT GOOD TO WIN AGAIN.

06:01.290 --> 06:04.430
AIN'T BEEN A WHOLE LOT OF
THAT GOING ON.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.260
DARNELL AND DILLON ARE STILL
WHUPPING MY ASS

06:06.290 --> 06:07.630
AT FRIDAY NIGHT TABOO.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.530
I MEAN, ME AND MOMS KNOW
THEY'RE CHEATING.

06:09.560 --> 06:12.900
WE JUST AIN'T FIGURED OUT
THEIR TRICKS YET, YOU KNOW?

06:12.930 --> 06:14.640
I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS.

06:14.670 --> 06:17.040
MY SHOULDER IS FINALLY HEALED.

06:17.070 --> 06:20.910
NO MORE P.T. FOR ME. YOUR BOY
SPENCER JAMES IS BACK.

06:20.940 --> 06:22.580
DARNELL: YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY SAY ABOUT FOLKS WHO
TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES

06:22.610 --> 06:24.380
IN THIRD PERSON?

06:24.410 --> 06:27.250
YEAH. THEY SAY WE
DESTINED FOR GREATNESS.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.180
YEAH. OK, WHATEVER.

06:29.220 --> 06:30.990
BRO.

06:31.020 --> 06:33.590
LOOKS LIKE WE HAD
THE SAME IDEA.

06:33.620 --> 06:35.920
I WON'T INTERRUPT.
I'LL WAIT MY TURN.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.090
YOU GOOD, MAN?

06:38.130 --> 06:42.400
YEAH. JUST TRYING
TO GET AS MUCH TIME IN
WITH COREY AS I CAN.

06:42.430 --> 06:44.400
YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

06:44.430 --> 06:46.300
YOU AIN'T HEARD?

06:46.330 --> 06:49.300
SOUTH CRENSHAW IS
BEING CONVERTED INTO
A MAGNET SCHOOL

06:49.340 --> 06:51.170
WITH LESS FOCUS ON
ATHLETICS.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.410
-WAIT. WHAT?
-YEAH.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.610
ME AND EVERYBODY ELSE
ARE GONNA HAVE TO ENTER
SOME LOTTERY SYSTEM

06:55.640 --> 06:57.950
TO EVEN HAVE A SHOT
AT ENROLLING.

06:57.980 --> 06:59.280
SOUTH CRENSHAW MEANS
EVERYTHING TO
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

06:59.310 --> 07:01.150
WHY THEY DOING THIS?

07:01.180 --> 07:03.280
I MEAN, WITH ALL
THE FOOTBALL DRAMA
THIS YEAR

07:03.320 --> 07:05.650
AND LOSING
TWO HEAD COACHES,

07:05.690 --> 07:08.360
IT CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR SOME FOLKS WHO WANTED
A MAGNET CONVERSION

07:08.390 --> 07:09.990
TO FINALLY
PUSH IT THROUGH.

07:10.020 --> 07:12.030
THEY OFFICIALLY VOTING
ON IT NEXT WEEK.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.100
SUPPOSEDLY
IT'S A LOCK.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.030
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
MY OLD SCHOOL,

07:18.070 --> 07:21.100
COOP'S SCHOOL,
THE SCHOOL WHERE MY POPS
BUILT HIS LEGACY...

07:22.600 --> 07:25.970
YOU TELLING ME THAT'S
GOING AWAY?

07:30.910 --> 07:33.050
PATIENCE: TAKING AWAY
OUR SCHOOL IS SOME BULL,
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.

07:33.050 --> 07:36.080
KIA: HOW ARE A BUNCH OF
SUITS GONNA DECIDE WHAT'S
BEST FOR THE COMMUNITY

07:36.120 --> 07:37.850
WITHOUT CHECKING
WITH THE COMMUNITY?

07:37.880 --> 07:39.950
WE GOT TO RALLY EVERYONE--
STUDENTS, TEACHERS.

07:39.990 --> 07:41.690
WE GOT TO SHOW
THE DISTRICT WE UNIFIED.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.990
OR MAYBE WE DO
A FUND RAISER.

07:44.020 --> 07:45.730
AIN'T LACK OF RESOURCES
PART OF THE EXCUSE

07:45.760 --> 07:47.390
FOR CONVERTING IT
TO A MAGNET?

07:47.430 --> 07:49.700
I'M LOVING THIS
BLACK EXCELLENCE,

07:49.730 --> 07:51.830
BUT Y'ALL CAN'T MOVE
MOUNTAINS ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

07:51.870 --> 07:53.930
YES. THANK YOU.

07:53.970 --> 07:56.000
CHRIS: OK, BUT I'M STILL
HELLA CONFUSED, THOUGH.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.740
LIKE, WHY DOES THE SCHOOL BOARD
SUDDENLY THINK

07:58.770 --> 08:01.080
A MAGNET SCHOOL IS THE ANSWER
TO ALL OF CRENSHAW'S PROBLEMS?

08:01.110 --> 08:03.710
-I MEAN, WHAT HAPPENED?
-SUPERINTENDENT CARTER HAPPENED.

08:03.740 --> 08:06.180
APPARENTLY, HE'S
WORKING ON A REHAUL OF
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT.

08:06.210 --> 08:07.980
THINKS CONVERTING
THE SCHOOL IS THE KEY

08:08.010 --> 08:09.420
TO BRINGING NEW MONEY
INTO CRENSHAW.

08:09.450 --> 08:11.490
WE GOT TO CHANGE
CARTER'S MIND.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.250
OR AT LEAST
THE OTHER VOTING
MEMBERS OF THE BOARD.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.060
WELL, HOW?

08:15.090 --> 08:17.060
SPENCER:
BY DRAWING ATTENTION
TO THE CONVERSION.

08:17.090 --> 08:18.460
I MEAN, THERE'S PRESSURE
IN NUMBERS, RIGHT?
WHAT ABOUT A WALK OUT?

08:18.490 --> 08:20.290
OR A SIT-IN.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.260
OK, I HEARD THE SUPERINTENDENT
WAS PLANNING A VISIT

08:22.300 --> 08:24.100
AFTER SCHOOL TOMORROW WITH
SOME BOARD MEMBERS.

08:24.130 --> 08:26.370
HE WANTS TO SHOW THEM
HIS BIG PLAN.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.740
HEY, THAT'S LIT. WE
GONNA GO ROSA PARKS
ON THESE FOOLS.

08:31.140 --> 08:34.840
UH, DON'T YOU HAVE
YOUR FINAL ENGLISH
PRESENTATION TOMORROW?

08:34.880 --> 08:36.940
YEAH,
BUT I NEED TO BE HERE.

08:36.980 --> 08:38.850
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS
GET GOING TO BEVERLY HILLS

08:38.880 --> 08:41.420
SO YOU DON'T MISS
THE LAST BUS.

08:41.450 --> 08:44.520
-CHRIS?
-OOH!

08:44.550 --> 08:46.320
♪ IT LOOK GOOD,
READY TO EAT ♪

08:46.350 --> 08:49.020
HEY, Y'ALL,
I GOT TO--I GOT
TO ROLL OUT.

08:49.060 --> 08:51.530
OH, NO, IT'S
ALL GOOD, MAN. WE
GOT THIS COVERED.

08:51.560 --> 08:55.130
LOOK, WE SHOULD HAVE
PEOPLE SPEAK UP AT
THE SIT-IN TOMORROW,

08:55.160 --> 08:57.500
TALK ABOUT WHAT
THE SCHOOL MEANS
TO THEM,

08:57.530 --> 08:59.830
AND POST IT
ON THE GRAM.

08:59.870 --> 09:02.240
KIA: OK, I SEE YOU.
THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME BRAINS
BEHIND THOSE GOOD LOOKS.

09:02.270 --> 09:04.000
PATIENCE: OH, MY GOSH.
SHE SAID HE HAS BRAINS.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.380
MAN, I GOT THIS NEW
TRACK I'MMA DROP
THIS SUMMER ON TOUR

09:09.410 --> 09:11.510
CALLED "FLY THE COOP."
IT IS FIRE.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.850
DON'T YOU STILL GOT
WORK TO DO TO GET READY?

09:13.880 --> 09:15.980
WHAT YOU DOING HERE?

09:16.020 --> 09:17.280
I'M VISITING
MY UNGRATEFUL FRIEND,
LIKE I DO EVERY DAY.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.090
YOU NEED
TO MOVE ON, COOP.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.420
YOUR LIFE AIN'T HERE
DISCUSSING MY
CAFETERIA OPTIONS.

09:21.450 --> 09:23.990
MAN, WHATEVER.
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT
MEAT LOAF, THOUGH, HUH?

09:24.020 --> 09:26.330
YO, DO NOT TRUST ANYTHING
MADE OF MYSTERY MEAT.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.860
YOU THINK
I'M PLAYING?

09:28.900 --> 09:30.460
TRY TO VISIT ME
HERE AGAIN AND SEE
WHAT HAPPENS.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.200
GO LIVE
YOUR LIFE, COOP.

09:33.230 --> 09:34.970
IT'S YOUR TIME
TO SHINE.

09:46.980 --> 09:49.550
UH, MS. BRYANT'S
FINAL?

09:49.580 --> 09:52.320
OK, LOOK, SIMONE, IF
YOU'RE HERE TO YELL--

09:52.350 --> 09:55.090
JORDAN, NO YELLING.

09:55.120 --> 09:58.160
I JUST WANTED TO
SAY THANK YOU,
ACTUALLY,

09:58.190 --> 10:00.830
FOR TALKING
TO MY MOM.

10:00.860 --> 10:02.830
OHH.

10:02.860 --> 10:04.970
AND WHATEVER JORDAN BAKER
MAGIC YOU USED ON HER,

10:05.000 --> 10:06.030
IT ACTUALLY WORKED.

10:06.070 --> 10:08.200
I'M BACK HOME,

10:08.240 --> 10:10.500
AND THINGS ARE--
THEY'RE KIND OF GOOD.

10:10.540 --> 10:13.210
WOW. THAT'S GREAT, SIMONE.
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

10:13.240 --> 10:16.180
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'VE
CHANGED YOUR MIND
ABOUT THE BABY OR...?

10:16.210 --> 10:19.380
I THINK ADOPTION
IS STILL BEST, SO...

10:19.410 --> 10:22.250
ANYWAY...

10:25.520 --> 10:28.460
I KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED WITH ME,

10:28.490 --> 10:30.620
IT KIND OF TOOK YOUR
ATTENTION AWAY
FROM FOOTBALL,

10:30.660 --> 10:34.160
AND I PUT TOGETHER
THIS SPECIAL HIGHLIGHT
REEL OF YOUR CAREER,

10:34.190 --> 10:36.530
TO REMIND YOU OF
HOW GOOD YOU ARE.

10:40.570 --> 10:43.470
THANK YOU, SIMONE. UM...

10:43.500 --> 10:47.370
NO ONE--NO ONE'S EVER
DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS
FOR ME BEFORE.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.580
YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.250
HAVE AN AMAZING SUMMER,
JORDAN BAKER.

11:06.330 --> 11:08.100
HI. YOU'VE
REACHED LESLIE.

11:08.130 --> 11:09.660
I'M NOT AROUND RIGHT NOW,
BUT LEAVE A MESSAGE

11:09.700 --> 11:12.200
AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU
AS SOON AS I CAN. THANK YOU.

11:12.230 --> 11:17.000
AHEM. HEY, LESLIE,
UM, BEEN A WHILE.

11:17.040 --> 11:22.940
I WAS, UM, I WAS
HOPING TO CATCH UP
OR SOMETHING.

11:22.980 --> 11:25.910
UM, YEAH.
HIT ME BACK, OK?

11:32.690 --> 11:35.120
-HEY.
-HI.

11:38.330 --> 11:41.600
ASH, I KNOW I SAID THAT
WE SHOULD TAKE A BREAK,

11:41.630 --> 11:43.660
AND THAT MAKES THINGS
REALLY WEIRD NOW,

11:43.700 --> 11:48.940
BUT, UM, BUT WE WERE
BEST FRIENDS FIRST,

11:48.970 --> 11:51.440
AND I...

11:51.470 --> 11:55.310
-I MISS YOU.
-I MISS YOU, TOO.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.710
WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.

11:57.740 --> 11:59.610
I MEAN, WE HAVE ALL SUMMER
TO SORT THROUGH

11:59.650 --> 12:01.680
THE MESS WE MADE.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.320
ACTUALLY, MY MOM
INVITED ME TO SPEND
THE SUMMER WITH HER

12:03.350 --> 12:05.220
ON JACOB'S YACHT.

12:05.250 --> 12:08.590
YOU KNOW, JUST
THE TWO OF US,
MINI WORLD TOUR.

12:08.620 --> 12:11.290
SHE WANTS TO GET BACK
THE TIME WE LOST.

12:11.320 --> 12:15.730
WOW. THAT'S--
THAT'S AMAZING.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.360
YEAH.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.570
UM, WELL, I SHOULD--

12:19.600 --> 12:22.000
I SHOULD GET
TO CLASS, SO...

12:22.040 --> 12:23.540
YEAH.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.750
SPENCER: DAMN.

12:31.780 --> 12:33.350
YO, THESE ARE
DOPE, LAYLA.

12:33.380 --> 12:34.550
COOP: I KNOW, RIGHT?
WHICH ONE YOUR POP LIKE?

12:34.580 --> 12:36.180
I HAVEN'T
SHOWN HIM YET.

12:36.220 --> 12:37.550
HE'S BEEN SO BUSY
WITH THE BIG TOUR,

12:37.580 --> 12:39.250
I DIDN'T WANT TO
GET IN HIS WAY.

12:39.290 --> 12:41.620
I THOUGHT YOU WAS COOL
WITH HIM LEAVING.

12:41.650 --> 12:45.160
I AM. I--HE'S ALREADY
SPENT ENOUGH TIME AT
HOME DEALING WITH ME.

12:45.190 --> 12:47.560
AND HIS WORK IS
IMPORTANT TO HIM,

12:47.590 --> 12:51.100
AND HIS CLIENTS NEED
HIM, AND I NEED TO LET
HIM GET BACK TO THEM.

12:51.130 --> 12:53.330
-HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S UP?
-HEY, WHAT'S UP, PATIENCE?

12:53.370 --> 12:54.570
YOU READY?

12:54.600 --> 12:56.740
WE GOT TWO HOURS.

12:56.770 --> 12:59.710
IN L.A. TRAFFIC? NO.
DARNELL AND KIA WILL
KILL US IF WE'RE LATE.

12:59.740 --> 13:01.380
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO THE SIT-IN?

13:01.410 --> 13:03.480
I CAN'T. I GOT TO WORK.

13:03.510 --> 13:05.250
I COULDN'T FIND NOBODY
TO COVER MY SHIFT.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.080
BE GLAD, BRO.

13:07.110 --> 13:08.550
THAT WAY, YOU AIN'T GOT
TO DEAL WITH COMMANDER KIA

13:08.580 --> 13:10.450
AND LIEUTENANT DARNELL. OK?

13:10.480 --> 13:11.790
THEY ARE TAKING THIS
LEADING THE CHARGE
THING VERY SERIOUS.

13:11.820 --> 13:14.590
HEY, YOU ALL DO
YOUR THING TONIGHT.

13:14.620 --> 13:18.160
I SHOULD GET GOING,
TOO. I GOT TO HELP
MY DAD PACK.

13:18.190 --> 13:20.090
PACK FOR WHAT?

13:20.130 --> 13:21.660
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THE TOUR.

13:21.690 --> 13:23.260
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

13:23.300 --> 13:25.130
HE BACKED OUT.

13:25.170 --> 13:26.730
ONE OF HIS EXECS IS
COVERING FOR HIM.

13:26.770 --> 13:29.340
YOUR DAD IS STAYING HOME
FOR THE SUMMER.

13:44.250 --> 13:46.220
SPENCER, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

13:46.250 --> 13:48.320
AND "WHAT'S UP"
TO YOU, TOO.

13:48.350 --> 13:50.390
BABY, SHOULDN'T YOU BE
GETTING READY FOR
YOUR TEAM'S GALA?

13:50.420 --> 13:53.130
I FORGOT
MY DRESS SHOES.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.360
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON?

13:55.400 --> 13:57.660
NOTHING. NOTHING.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.230
I JUST WANTED
TO COME HOME.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.730
I WANTED TO SEE YOU
AND DILLON.

14:00.770 --> 14:03.300
WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM?

14:03.340 --> 14:06.740
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
WE MISS YOU, TOO.

14:06.770 --> 14:09.380
-YOU SURE?
-HA HA!

14:09.410 --> 14:11.080
WHAT'S THAT?

14:11.110 --> 14:14.210
SUPPLIES FOR THE RALLY
AT SLAUSON CAFE TONIGHT.

14:14.250 --> 14:15.780
WHAT RALLY?

14:15.820 --> 14:19.120
DARNELL AND KIA AND COOP
PLANNED IT TO SAVE CRENSHAW.

14:19.150 --> 14:22.190
THE SIT-IN LAST NIGHT
WAS KIND OF A BUST.

14:22.220 --> 14:25.190
YEAH, SUPERINTENDENT CARTER
FOUND OUT ABOUT IT SOMEHOW,

14:25.230 --> 14:27.130
HAD THE COPS ALREADY AT
THE SCHOOL WAITING.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.300
BUT LIKE DARNELL SAID,

14:29.330 --> 14:32.430
CARTER CAN'T STOP
THEM FROM RALLYING
THE COMMUNITY ELSEWHERE.

14:32.470 --> 14:35.470
SLAUSON CAFE IT IS. UH!

14:35.500 --> 14:37.500
SO WHY DIDN'T
NOBODY TELL ME?

14:37.540 --> 14:39.570
HONEY, IT CAME
TOGETHER ALL
VERY LAST MINUTE,

14:39.610 --> 14:41.480
AND YOU HAVE YOUR
GALA TONIGHT.

14:41.510 --> 14:43.240
DARNELL AND
THE OTHER KIDS
GOT IT HANDLED.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.480
SO DON'T NOBODY
NEED ME.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.710
SPENCER, NOBODY
SAID THAT.

14:46.750 --> 14:49.150
YOU ALL GOT THIS BIG
FIGHT FOR SOUTH CRENSHAW,

14:49.180 --> 14:50.650
AND MEANWHILE, I'M JUST
SUPPOSED TO GO PLAY DRESS UP

14:50.680 --> 14:53.290
WITH MY RICH FRIENDS
INSTEAD?

14:53.320 --> 14:55.620
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE
TO BE YOU ON THE FRONT
LINE, SPENCER.

14:55.660 --> 14:57.890
AND YOUR GALA
IS IMPORTANT.

14:57.920 --> 15:01.460
IT'S THE CULMINATION
OF AN UNBELIEVABLE YEAR
FOR YOU AND THE EAGLES.

15:01.490 --> 15:05.500
LOOK AT EVERYTHING
YOU OVERCAME LAST YEAR
ON THAT FIELD, SPENCER.

15:05.530 --> 15:06.900
THAT DESERVES TO BE
CELEBRATED.

15:06.930 --> 15:13.310
YOU DESERVE TO BE
CELEBRATED, OK?

15:24.220 --> 15:26.690
HAROLD: PACKING'S
A LITTLE PREMATURE,
ISN'T IT?

15:26.720 --> 15:29.790
WE BOTH KNOW THIS
INVESTIGATION ISN'T
GONNA GO MY WAY.

15:29.820 --> 15:32.790
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT WASN'T GONNA
GO YOUR WAY.

15:32.820 --> 15:35.660
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WASN'T"?

15:37.630 --> 15:39.370
FROM THE BOOSTERS,

15:39.400 --> 15:42.670
LETTERS OF SUPPORT FOR
ENDING THE INVESTIGATION

15:42.700 --> 15:44.640
AND YOU STAYING ON
AS HEAD COACH.

15:44.670 --> 15:46.870
THE INVESTIGATION IS
EFFECTIVELY OVER.

15:46.910 --> 15:49.210
HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO--

15:49.240 --> 15:51.610
I OWED YOU FOR
STANDING UP FOR MY BOY.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.450
CONSIDER US EVEN
FOR NOW.

15:54.480 --> 15:58.680
OH, OK.
I SEE HOW THIS GOES.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.490
SO, THEN, WHAT DO
THE BOOSTERS WANT FROM ME

16:01.520 --> 16:04.690
IN RETURN FOR THIS, UH,
THIS FAVOR?

16:04.720 --> 16:07.260
THEY HAVE SOME THOUGHTS
FOR NEXT SEASON.

16:07.290 --> 16:08.760
THEY'LL BE IN TOUCH.

16:24.580 --> 16:26.450
WHY THEY GOT TO MAKE
THE HOLES SO SMALL AND
THE CUFFLINKS SO BIG?

16:26.480 --> 16:28.750
LOOK, I NEED HELP
FROM A PRO. PLEASE.

16:30.620 --> 16:31.920
COME ON.

16:33.790 --> 16:35.820
HELPING OTHERS
IS OVERRATED.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.690
I AIN'T SEEN YOU
AT NONE OF OUR
MIDNIGHT HANGS LATELY.

16:40.730 --> 16:42.430
HOPE THAT MEANS YOU'RE
SLEEPING BETTER.

16:42.460 --> 16:46.800
NOT REALLY. JUST BEEN
DRAWING IN MY ROOM,

16:46.830 --> 16:48.530
TRYING TO CLEAR
MY MIND INSTEAD.

16:48.570 --> 16:50.500
HEY, I CAN'T BLAME YOU.

16:50.540 --> 16:53.410
THEM REAL HOUSEWIVES
ARE GETTING REAL CRAZY.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.440
AIN'T NOTHING SCARIER
THAN A RICH WHITE WOMAN
PLANNING

16:55.470 --> 16:56.980
A 3-YEAR-OLD'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

16:58.610 --> 17:00.310
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,
YOU DOING OK?

17:02.610 --> 17:04.450
JUST A LOT GOING ON
RIGHT NOW.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.490
YEAH, AND YOUR POPS
MOVING OUT DON'T HELP.

17:06.520 --> 17:09.560
YEAH. WELL, PLUS,
ASHER'S GOING AWAY WITH
HIS MOM FOR THE SUMMER.

17:09.590 --> 17:12.960
MY MOM'S GOT
AN IMPORTANT NEW JOB.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.760
IT JUST FEELS LIKE
EVERYONE'S MOVING ON.

17:15.790 --> 17:18.260
YOU REACH OUT TO YOUR
SPONSOR LATELY?

17:18.300 --> 17:20.300
-YES.
-LIV.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.670
I'M GOOD, SPENCER.
I PROMISE.

17:22.700 --> 17:25.940
-OK.
-OK.

17:32.710 --> 17:34.380
JORDAN: WELL, I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE THIS INTO A DRINK

17:34.410 --> 17:35.510
CALLED CUDDLES ON
THE BEACH,

17:35.550 --> 17:38.280
BUT, HEY, HERE WE ARE. MMM.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.820
YO, FOR REAL,

17:39.850 --> 17:41.420
THIS PARTY'S
INSANE.

17:41.450 --> 17:42.820
JORDAN: AND ALL PAID FOR
WITH LEFT-OVER MONEY

17:42.850 --> 17:43.920
FROM THE FOOTBALL PROGRAM.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.660
THAT'S THE CRAZIER PART.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.430
-ARE YOU SERIOUS?
-MM-HMM.

17:47.460 --> 17:49.600
MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY
ARE JUST 10 MILES AWAY

17:49.630 --> 17:52.000
FIGHTING TO KEEP
THEIR SCHOOL OPEN.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.830
MEANWHILE, WE LITERALLY
WATCH MONEY MELT
OFF ICE SCULPTURES?

17:53.870 --> 17:55.470
YEAH...

17:56.770 --> 17:58.640
IS THAT A CUDDLES
ON THE BEACH?

17:58.670 --> 18:00.540
MAYBE.

18:00.570 --> 18:02.880
HOW ABOUT WE MAKE IT
A LITTLE BIT MORE
THAN A CUDDLE?

18:02.910 --> 18:09.550
OH. UM, NOT TONIGHT.
THANK YOU, THOUGH.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.650
HI.

18:13.890 --> 18:15.490
-YOUR FAN CLUB'S BACK.
-MM-MM. NO.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.760
NOT MY TYPE.

18:17.790 --> 18:19.960
SIMONE'S GOT YOU
WIDE OPEN LIKE THAT.

18:19.990 --> 18:21.660
WHATEVER. OK,
SIMONE'S NOT
INTERESTED ANYWAY.

18:21.690 --> 18:24.030
UH, YOU MEAN THE SIMONE
WHO SPENT ALL THAT TIME

18:24.060 --> 18:25.700
CREATING THAT DOPE-ASS
HIGHLIGHT REEL,

18:25.730 --> 18:27.870
THE ONE WHO MOVED HERSELF
OUT TO A HOTEL

18:27.900 --> 18:29.540
JUST SO YOU COULD HAVE
YOUR LIFE BACK?

18:29.570 --> 18:32.610
YEAH, YOU RIGHT.
SHE NOT FEELING YOU.

18:34.710 --> 18:36.380
GOOD LUCK, MAN.

18:37.710 --> 18:39.910
♪ 4, 3, 2, 1 ♪

18:45.750 --> 18:47.990
TREY: I MEAN, I TOOK IT
EASY ON HIM, OF COURSE,
RIGHT?

18:48.020 --> 18:51.020
I SHOT A COUPLE
OVER PAR.

18:51.060 --> 18:53.030
I MEAN, IT'S
TOM BRADY, OK?

18:53.060 --> 18:55.090
I COULDN'T
MAKE HIM LOOK BAD.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.930
A LITTLE UNDERDRESSED,
DON'T YOU THINK?

18:58.960 --> 19:01.130
YEAH, IT'S ALL GOOD.
I WON'T BE HERE LONG.

19:01.170 --> 19:03.970
I FINALLY REALIZED,
IT AIN'T GONNA MATTER

19:04.000 --> 19:06.110
HOW MANY CHAMPIONSHIPS
I LEAD US TO.

19:06.140 --> 19:09.110
I AM CONSTANTLY
GONNA KEEP TRYING
TO PROVE MY WORTH

19:09.140 --> 19:12.750
TO YOU AND THE BOOSTERS,
AND I AIN'T ABOUT THAT LIFE.

19:12.780 --> 19:16.080
I KNOW MY WORTH. I KNOW
I'LL NEVER BE THE PUPPET
THAT Y'ALL WANT ME TO BE.

19:16.110 --> 19:20.850
AND IF I STAY ON, I'LL
EVENTUALLY STOP BEING
THE MAN I KNOW MYSELF TO BE.

19:20.890 --> 19:23.760
THE ONES WHO'LL
SUFFER THE MOST ARE
MY BOYS ON THE TEAM,

19:23.790 --> 19:25.720
AND I AIN'T GONNA LET
THAT HAPPEN.

19:25.760 --> 19:29.530
SO THANKS,
BUT, NO, THANKS.

19:31.430 --> 19:32.900
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING, BILLY?

19:32.930 --> 19:34.600
I AM OFFICIALLY
RESIGNING AS HEAD COACH

19:34.630 --> 19:35.870
OF THE BEVERLY EAGLES.

19:38.100 --> 19:39.570
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.070
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

19:41.110 --> 19:43.740
BILLY.

19:50.550 --> 19:53.790
THE AUDACITY, AFTER
WE WERE WILLING TO GIVE
HIM ANOTHER CHANCE.

19:53.820 --> 19:55.850
HE LACKS WORTH ETHIC, OK?

19:55.890 --> 19:58.220
THAT WAS ALWAYS
BILLY'S PROBLEM.

19:58.260 --> 19:59.960
EVER SINCE I'VE KNOWN HIM,
HE'S DONE THIS.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.830
HOW DARE YOU.

20:02.860 --> 20:04.360
AH--

20:04.400 --> 20:05.760
D.A. BAKER. UM...

20:05.800 --> 20:08.730
YOU KNOW WHAT?
STOP TALKING, OK?

20:08.770 --> 20:12.300
BILLY PUT HIS HEART
AND SOUL INTO THIS
FOOTBALL PROGRAM

20:12.340 --> 20:14.870
AND NEVER ASKED FOR
ANYTHING IN RETURN.

20:14.910 --> 20:17.540
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT CHARACTER?

20:17.580 --> 20:20.810
BEVERLY WILL NEVER FIND
ANOTHER HEAD COACH THAT
CARES ABOUT HIS PLAYERS

20:20.850 --> 20:22.510
AS MUCH AS BILLY DOES.

20:22.550 --> 20:26.480
TRUST ME, YOU'RE GONNA
REGRET LOSING HIM.

20:31.790 --> 20:34.560
-FOR COACH BAKER.
-YEAH!

20:37.660 --> 20:39.030
HOW'S COACH BAKER?

20:39.060 --> 20:40.670
SURPRISINGLY GOOD.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.130
HE SAID HE'S AT PEACE
WITH HIS DECISION.

20:42.170 --> 20:44.140
ARE YOU?

20:44.170 --> 20:46.700
I HAVEN'T REALLY
PROCESSED IT YET.

20:46.740 --> 20:49.070
I MEAN, THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH
CHANGE THESE PAST FEW MONTHS,

20:49.110 --> 20:51.940
NOTHING SURPRISES
ME NO MORE.

20:51.980 --> 20:54.710
DARNELL ON VIDEO: HEY, GUYS,
WE JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU...

20:54.750 --> 20:56.710
LAYLA: LOOKS LIKE
THE RALLY'S GOING WELL.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.220
HOPEFULLY, A LITTLE
LESS DRAMA THAN HERE.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.750
EVERYBODY'S THERE.

20:59.780 --> 21:02.020
NOT EVERYBODY.

21:03.820 --> 21:05.820
THEY DON'T NEED ME.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.930
WELL, MAYBE THIS TIME
IT'S YOU THAT NEEDS THEM.

21:07.960 --> 21:11.200
I'D BE BLIND NOT
TO NOTICE HOW RESTLESS
YOU'VE BEEN LATELY.

21:11.230 --> 21:14.600
HOME, CRENSHAW.
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
WHAT CENTERS YOU.

21:14.630 --> 21:19.170
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
YOU COULD USE A MAJOR
DOSE OF HOME RIGHT NOW.

21:21.140 --> 21:22.810
YOU DOWN FOR A RIDE?

21:22.840 --> 21:24.640
COME ON.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.110
KIA: THEY'RE TRYING
TO IMPOSE

21:27.140 --> 21:29.050
THIS TRANSFORMATION
ON OUR SCHOOL

21:29.080 --> 21:32.050
WITHOUT CONSULTING PARENTS,
TEACHERS, ANY OF US.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.050
DARNELL: TEACHERS
ARE GONNA HAVE
TO REAPPLY FOR JOBS

21:34.080 --> 21:35.950
JUST LIKE WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO REAPPLY

21:35.990 --> 21:37.920
JUST FOR A CHANCE
TO ATTEND
THROUGH A LOTTERY.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.820
AND AIN'T NO WAY WE'RE
STANDING FOR THIS, RIGHT?

21:39.860 --> 21:41.930
THANK YOU...

21:41.960 --> 21:43.860
YO, REMIND ME TO
NEVER GET ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF THOSE TWO.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.700
HEY.

21:47.730 --> 21:49.670
GRACE: HEY. WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

21:49.700 --> 21:51.840
DONATE WHATEVER
RESOURCES YOU CAN
FOR THE SCHOOL.

21:51.870 --> 21:54.770
HELP US BUILD THE CASE
THAT WE CAN SUCCEED AS
A REGULAR PUBLIC SCHOOL.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.740
BILLY DID WHAT?

21:57.780 --> 21:59.010
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE, MA.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.650
EVEN WITHOUT COACH BAKER,

22:00.680 --> 22:02.610
BEVERLY FOOTBALL'S
STILL GOT A FUTURE,

22:02.650 --> 22:04.750
WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY
FOR SOUTH CRENSHAW RIGHT NOW.

22:04.780 --> 22:07.220
SO WHO'S GOT NEXT?
THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.

22:07.250 --> 22:09.550
THIS IS WHERE I NEED TO BE
TONIGHT.

22:09.590 --> 22:11.090
GRACE: OK.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.690
YOU STICKING AROUND?

22:12.720 --> 22:15.630
UH, NO. I GOT TO
GO FIND MY DAD.

22:15.660 --> 22:17.560
THE SAME WAY BEING
AT HOME SETTLES YOU,

22:17.600 --> 22:19.100
BEING ON TOUR SETTLES HIM.

22:19.130 --> 22:22.100
I GOT TO SOMEHOW CONVINCE
HIM TO GO ON TOUR.

22:22.130 --> 22:24.770
MY MONEY'S ON YOU.

22:27.810 --> 22:30.210
BYE.

22:45.390 --> 22:47.930
ASH, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

22:47.960 --> 22:49.630
IF HART SEES YOU,
HE'LL--

22:49.660 --> 22:51.930
HE'LL WHAT? SUSPEND
AN ALREADY SUSPENDED PLAYER?

22:51.960 --> 22:56.170
LOOK, LIV, I THOUGHT A LOT
ABOUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT,

22:56.200 --> 22:59.170
AND I DON'T WANT TO
LEAVE YOU THIS SUMMER.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.170
ASHER.

23:01.210 --> 23:03.070
AND I DON'T WANT TO MISS
THIS TIME WITH MY MOM EITHER.

23:03.110 --> 23:06.140
SO WHAT IF YOU
CAME WITH US?

23:07.880 --> 23:09.280
WHAT, FOR
THE WHOLE SUMMER?

23:09.310 --> 23:11.280
WHAT BETTER WAY TO
WORK ON US

23:11.320 --> 23:13.280
THAN TO BE STUCK
ON A BOAT TOGETHER?

23:19.860 --> 23:23.360
OK.

23:23.390 --> 23:25.360
SIMONE: IT TAKES A LOT

23:25.400 --> 23:27.970
TO DRAG A PREGNANT
GIRL OUT OF BED
THIS LATE, JORDAN.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.100
OK, LOOK, IN MY DEFENSE,
I HAD A WHOLE PLAN ON
THE FIELD FOR A PICNIC,

23:32.140 --> 23:36.040
BUT THE FOG KIND OF
MESSED THAT UP.

23:36.070 --> 23:38.040
ANYWAYS, IT DOESN'T
MATTER, BECAUSE...

23:40.080 --> 23:42.110
I COME BEARING TREATS.

23:42.150 --> 23:43.650
JORDAN, WHAT IS THIS?

23:43.680 --> 23:44.850
THAT'S A MOCKTAIL.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.250
IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED
CUDDLES ON--

23:46.280 --> 23:49.850
NO. I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE DRINK.

23:52.820 --> 23:54.730
UM...

23:54.760 --> 23:56.360
I JUST--I WANTED TO ASK.

23:56.390 --> 23:58.700
WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT
HIGHLIGHT REEL FOR ME?

24:06.440 --> 24:11.140
YOU KNOW, SIMONE, WATCHING
MY HIGHLIGHTS GOT ME THINKING

24:11.180 --> 24:13.780
ABOUT MY FAVORITE PLAY WHEN
THE GAME IS ON THE LINE.

24:13.810 --> 24:17.310
BALL IN MY HANDS, I THROW
IT AS FAR AS I CAN,

24:17.350 --> 24:19.220
HOPING MY RECEIVER
WILL MAKE THE CATCH.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.420
IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED A--

24:20.450 --> 24:21.750
HAIL MARY.

24:24.150 --> 24:25.920
RIGHT.

24:25.960 --> 24:29.930
IT'S A LAST DITCH EFFORT.

24:29.960 --> 24:33.930
HARD TO MAKE WORK, BUT
YOU HAVE TO TRY, RIGHT?

24:33.960 --> 24:36.300
OTHERWISE THE GAME'S OVER.

24:36.330 --> 24:38.840
YEAH. BUT, JORDAN,
THIS ISN'T A GAME.

24:38.870 --> 24:41.910
THIS IS...

24:41.940 --> 24:43.410
IT'S REAL LIFE.

24:43.440 --> 24:47.210
OH, I KNOW.
BUT THE SAME RULES APPLY.

24:52.750 --> 24:56.390
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU,
SIMONE, OK?

24:56.420 --> 24:58.760
AND I KNOW YOU MIGHT NOT
FEEL THE SAME WAY,

24:58.790 --> 25:04.100
AND THAT'S OK, BUT I JUST
NEEDED YOU TO KNOW.

25:04.130 --> 25:06.930
AND THAT WAS MY HAIL MARY,
BY THE WAY, IN CASE--

25:14.300 --> 25:18.110
GRACE: AN ORGANIZED,
TELEVISED PROTEST
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.

25:18.140 --> 25:20.480
GET OUR FIGHT IN
THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT.

25:20.510 --> 25:24.750
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
RAISE SOME REAL FUNDS
FOR THIS SCHOOL?

25:24.780 --> 25:28.850
A BACHELOR AUCTION, RIGHT?

25:30.250 --> 25:31.920
UM, EXCUSE ME.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.420
MICAH: YOU GOOD?
GRACE: YEAH.

25:33.460 --> 25:37.230
I GOT 400 FOR A DATE NOW
WITH YOUR FINE YOUNG SELF.

25:37.260 --> 25:39.100
YOU PUT ME UP ON THAT
STAGE, I COULD GET YOU

25:39.130 --> 25:41.370
BIDS QUADRUPLE THAT
IN MINUTES.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.070
UM, I'M NOT
SINGLE, DENISE.

25:44.100 --> 25:47.370
AW. NOT EVEN TO HELP
THE KIDS?

25:52.140 --> 25:54.910
GRACE: SUPERINTENDENT CARTER,
ARE YOU LOST?

25:56.480 --> 25:59.420
THE FLYER SAID THIS EVENT
WAS OPEN TO THE COMMUNITY.

25:59.450 --> 26:01.290
WELL, IF YOU REALLY
CARED ABOUT THIS COMMUNITY,

26:01.320 --> 26:02.950
YOU WOULDN'T BE
TRYING TO SHOVE

26:02.990 --> 26:05.160
THIS MAGNET CONVERSION
DOWN OUR THROATS.

26:05.190 --> 26:08.030
WHAT I'M PROPOSING IS
GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY.

26:08.060 --> 26:11.330
URBAN REVITALIZATION
CAN'T HAPPEN
WITHOUT GENTRIFICATION.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.900
AND STUDIES HAVE SHOWN
THAT NEIGHBORHOODS
GENTRIFY FASTER

26:13.930 --> 26:16.500
WITH THE INCREASED PRESENCE
OF MAGNET SCHOOLS.

26:16.530 --> 26:18.140
EVERYTHING GOOD, MA?

26:18.170 --> 26:19.800
ABSOLUTELY.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.840
JUST LISTENING TO
SUPERINTENDENT CARTER

26:21.870 --> 26:24.580
MANSPLAIN URBAN
REVITALIZATION TO ME.

26:24.610 --> 26:26.510
AND LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, CARTER,

26:26.540 --> 26:29.250
GENTRIFICATION ISN'T
ALWAYS THE ANSWER
TO FIXING THE HOOD.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.020
CLEARLY IT WAS
A MISTAKE COMING HERE.

26:31.050 --> 26:32.820
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

26:32.850 --> 26:34.820
SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
BOUNCE WITHOUT
HEARING OUR SIDE?

26:34.850 --> 26:36.920
LOOK AROUND, SIR.

26:36.950 --> 26:40.360
LOOK HOW MANY PEOPLE
RALLIED WITH LESS THAN
A DAY'S NOTICE.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.260
IMAGINE HOW MANY MORE
GONNA SHOW UP

26:42.290 --> 26:43.890
TO FIGHT AT
THE SCHOOL BOARD
MEETING NEXT WEEK.

26:43.930 --> 26:46.300
THIS IS
OUR CRENSHAW, MAN.

26:46.330 --> 26:49.070
AIN'T NO WAY WE LETTING
OUR HOOD, OUR SCHOOLS

26:49.100 --> 26:52.200
GET STRIPPED
AWAY FROM US
PIECE BY PIECE.

26:52.240 --> 26:55.610
YOUR PASSION IS COMMENDABLE.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.080
I'M AFRAID IT'S TOO LATE.

26:58.110 --> 27:00.510
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

27:00.540 --> 27:02.050
I HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH
VOTES TO PUSH THROUGH

27:02.080 --> 27:04.380
MY MAGNET CONVERSION PLAN
TO THE SCHOOL,

27:04.410 --> 27:07.420
SO THE BOARD AGREED THERE'S
JUST NO POINT IN WAITING.

27:07.450 --> 27:11.060
THE MEETING TO VOTE ON
THE FATE OF SOUTH CRENSHAW

27:11.090 --> 27:12.360
HAS BEEN MOVED UP
TO TOMORROW.

27:14.890 --> 27:17.230
GOOD LUCK
WITH YOUR EVENT.

27:43.020 --> 27:44.920
DON'T EVEN
SEEM REAL.

27:47.020 --> 27:50.490
YEAH. YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

27:50.530 --> 27:55.600
THE WORD'S ALREADY SPREAD
TO RECRUITERS ABOUT YOUR
IMPRESSIVE RUN AT JAMBOREE.

27:55.630 --> 27:57.770
EVERYBODY LOVES
A GOOD COMEBACK STORY.

27:57.800 --> 28:02.100
SENIOR YEAR.
EVERY D-I SCHOOL IN
THE NATION IS GONNA WANT

28:02.140 --> 28:03.870
A PIECE OF
SPENCER JAMES.

28:03.910 --> 28:05.980
WON'T BE THE SAME
WITHOUT YOU.

28:06.010 --> 28:08.140
YOU THE REASON I'M
THE PLAYER I AM.

28:08.180 --> 28:11.950
NO. YOU, YOU'RE THE REASON.

28:11.980 --> 28:14.120
DON'T FORGET THAT.

28:14.150 --> 28:18.020
HEY, I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

28:22.890 --> 28:26.100
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEING
YOUR YEAR OF FIRSTS.

28:26.130 --> 28:29.530
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GO THROUGH IT ALONE.

28:29.570 --> 28:34.940
COREY WILL ALWAYS BE
BY YOUR SIDE.

28:37.870 --> 28:40.010
SO WILL I

28:40.040 --> 28:45.750
NOT AS A COACH, BUT
ALWAYS AS YOUR FRIEND.

28:56.790 --> 28:58.860
J.P.: MAKE SURE YOU
HAVE EXTRA SECURITY
AT THAT VENUE.

28:58.890 --> 29:01.530
I DON'T WANT A REPEAT
OF LAST YEAR.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.830
AND MAKE SURE EVERY
ARTIST SHOWS UP ON--

29:03.870 --> 29:05.900
HEY. SERIAH,
CAN YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A SEC?

29:05.930 --> 29:07.070
OK.

29:08.270 --> 29:09.770
EVERYTHING OK?

29:09.810 --> 29:11.710
YOU'RE GOING ON
YOUR TOUR, DAD.

29:11.740 --> 29:14.880
YOU JUST GOT OUT OF REHAB
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

29:14.910 --> 29:16.950
LEAVING SO SOON WAS
A CRAZY IDEA.

29:16.980 --> 29:18.650
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.250
I NEED TO BE
HOME WITH YOU.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.950
I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT
THE HOME PART,

29:22.990 --> 29:24.850
BUT HOME ISN'T THE 4
WALLS WE LIVE BETWEEN.

29:24.890 --> 29:27.790
IT'S WHEREVER YOU
AND I ARE TOGETHER.

29:27.820 --> 29:31.860
SO THIS SUMMER, I'M
COMING WITH YOU.

29:31.890 --> 29:34.600
-YOU MEAN THAT?
-MM-HMM.

29:34.630 --> 29:36.200
WELL, HOW ABOUT YOUR
INDIE TOUR WITH COOP?

29:36.230 --> 29:38.000
I'VE ALREADY STARTED
CALLING THE SMALLER VENUES

29:38.030 --> 29:40.170
IN ALL THE CITIES
YOU'RE HITTING.

29:40.200 --> 29:42.140
COOP CAN PLAY
THOSE SPOTS, I STILL
GET MY INDIE TOUR,

29:42.170 --> 29:43.910
AND YOU AND I GET
OUR QUALITY TIME.

29:47.210 --> 29:49.280
OHH.

29:59.020 --> 30:00.860
HEY, WHERE'S YOUR
SUITCASE?

30:00.890 --> 30:02.890
THOUGHT YOUR MOM AGREED.

30:02.930 --> 30:04.830
I CAN'T GO WITH YOU, ASH.

30:06.230 --> 30:09.030
-LOOK--
-JUST WAIT. HEAR ME OUT, OK?

30:11.100 --> 30:16.810
YOU DESERVE TO HAVE
THE SUMMER ALONE
WITH YOUR MOM, OK,

30:16.840 --> 30:19.240
TO RECONNECT
AND REBUILD WHAT
YOU BOTH LOST.

30:19.270 --> 30:21.840
AND I KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS TO YOU.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.910
THAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP
YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSING
ON RIGHT NOW.

30:24.950 --> 30:27.020
WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN FOR US?

30:27.050 --> 30:31.120
IT MEANS THAT I WILL
SPEND THE SUMMER
WORKING ON MY PODCAST

30:31.150 --> 30:32.590
AND DRAWING.

30:32.620 --> 30:34.660
HEY, BUT
WHATEVER IT IS,

30:34.690 --> 30:36.590
I'LL BE WAITING
FOR MY BOYFRIEND
TO COME HOME

30:36.630 --> 30:39.660
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE
A KICK-ASS SENIOR YEAR.

30:45.270 --> 30:47.240
GRACE: HOW CAN THEY NOT
SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING?

30:47.270 --> 30:48.740
WHAT'D I MISS?

30:48.770 --> 30:51.740
MOM AND SOME OTHER
PARENTS WENT TO TALK

30:51.770 --> 30:54.040
TO THE PRESIDENT OF
THE SCHOOL BOARD
ABOUT SOUTH CRENSHAW,

30:54.080 --> 30:56.350
BUT SHE DIDN'T
LISTEN.

30:56.380 --> 30:58.180
DARNELL: THEY'RE SET ON
CONVERTING THE SCHOOL, MAN.

30:58.210 --> 31:00.350
THERE'S NOTHING WE
CAN DO ABOUT IT.

31:00.380 --> 31:03.050
SOUTH CRENSHAW WAS A PART
OF DAD'S LEGACY.

31:03.090 --> 31:06.620
SO NOW I'M NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO SHARE
THAT WITH HIM?

31:06.660 --> 31:09.330
WHEN WILL PEOPLE LEARN
THAT YOU CAN'T KEEP
TAKING RESOURCES

31:09.360 --> 31:12.290
OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AND EXPECT THE HOOD
TO STAY STANDING?

31:12.330 --> 31:16.030
HEY, WHAT IS THAT?

31:16.060 --> 31:18.700
IT'S THE RESOURCE.

31:44.430 --> 31:46.260
YO, WHAT'S UP, BROTHER?

31:48.430 --> 31:49.830
ASHER:
WHY DID YOU CALL
A TEAM MEETING?

31:49.870 --> 31:52.640
JORDAN: YO,
IS THIS ABOUT MY DAD?

31:54.670 --> 31:57.270
CROWD: THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER!
WE WILL TAKE OVER!

31:57.310 --> 32:00.280
THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER.
WE WILL TAKE OVER...

32:00.310 --> 32:02.910
SETTLE--QUIET!

32:02.940 --> 32:07.050
IF YOU DON'T QUIET DOWN,
YOU WILL BE REMOVED.

32:07.080 --> 32:09.190
QUIET.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.660
MAY I SPEAK,
MS. SANCHEZ?

32:16.690 --> 32:18.960
SPENCER JAMES ISN'T
A STUDENT AT THIS SCHOOL.

32:18.990 --> 32:20.300
IT'S NOT HIS PLACE
TO SPEAK.

32:20.330 --> 32:22.130
BUT I AM A MEMBER OF
THIS COMMUNITY, SIR.

32:22.160 --> 32:23.800
SO THAT GIVES ME
EVERY RIGHT.

32:23.830 --> 32:25.670
SANCHEZ: GO AHEAD,
MR. JAMES.

32:25.700 --> 32:27.670
TWO MINUTES.

32:30.110 --> 32:32.140
PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP ON
SOUTH CRENSHAW HIGH,

32:32.170 --> 32:34.940
MS. SANCHEZ.

32:34.980 --> 32:37.180
NOT YET.

32:37.210 --> 32:39.350
MY MOMS REMINDED ME TODAY THAT

32:39.380 --> 32:41.420
IF WE KEEP TAKING RESOURCES
OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

32:41.450 --> 32:44.220
IF WE KEEP DILUTING
THE LEGACIES AND MEMORIES

32:44.250 --> 32:45.990
CREATED BY THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,

32:46.020 --> 32:48.860
THERE GONNA BE NO HOOD LEFT
STANDING.

32:48.890 --> 32:50.890
AND, LOOK,
I'M GUILTY OF IT, TOO.

32:50.930 --> 32:53.160
I TOOK A RESOURCE AWAY
FROM MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.860
AND LIKE SUPERINTENDENT CARTER,
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING IT

32:55.900 --> 32:58.730
FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS,
BUT I WAS WRONG.

32:58.770 --> 33:01.400
I WAS WRONG.

33:02.940 --> 33:05.970
REINVESTING IN OUR COMMUNITY,
REINVESTING IN US,

33:06.010 --> 33:09.810
IN ALL OF US,
IS THE RIGHT CHOICE.

33:09.850 --> 33:12.850
THAT'S WHY I'M BRINGING BACK
THE RESOURCE I TOOK AWAY.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.050
WHAT RESOURCE ARE
YOU REFERRING TO?

33:15.080 --> 33:17.450
ME.

33:19.350 --> 33:22.420
I'M THE RESOURCE.

33:22.460 --> 33:25.260
I'M ONE OF THE TOP 100 PLAYERS
IN THE COUNTRY,

33:25.290 --> 33:28.000
BACK ON TOP OF EVERY
RECRUITER'S LIST.

33:28.030 --> 33:31.000
D-I SCHOOLS WILL TRAVEL
TO SEE MY PLAY.

33:31.030 --> 33:33.870
THAT KIND OF NATIONAL ATTENTION
WILL ATTRACT EVEN MORE RESOURCES

33:33.900 --> 33:36.470
AND TALENT NOT JUST FOR
THE SCHOOL

33:36.510 --> 33:40.040
BUT TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITHOUT
PUSHING THE LOCALS OUT.

33:41.880 --> 33:45.910
SO AS OF THIS FALL, I'LL BE
REENROLLING AS A STUDENT

33:45.950 --> 33:47.450
AT SOUTH CRENSHAW HIGH.

34:05.900 --> 34:08.900
SOUTH CRENSHAW DESERVES
ITS SHOT AT BEING GREAT.

34:10.870 --> 34:12.340
I RESPECTFULLY ASK

34:12.370 --> 34:14.280
THAT YOU ALL THINK
LONG AND HARD ABOUT THAT

34:14.310 --> 34:16.250
BEFORE YOU CAST YOUR VOTE.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.570
-HEY.
-HEY.

34:44.610 --> 34:46.980
THANKS FOR MEETING ME.

34:47.010 --> 34:50.180
YEAH, WELL, HA!
I HAD SOME FREE TIME
ON MY HANDS.

34:50.210 --> 34:52.850
HEY, I HEARD ABOUT
THE SCHOOL BOARD MEETING.

34:52.880 --> 34:56.120
ALL RIGHT. BRINGING IT BACK
TO WHERE IT ALL STARTED, HUH?

34:56.150 --> 34:57.190
YUP.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.250
COREY WOULD BE PROUD.

34:59.290 --> 35:03.830
THANKS. WELL, WE AIN'T
OUT THE WOODS YET.

35:03.860 --> 35:06.090
THEY ONLY
HOLDING OFF ON
CONVERTING THE SCHOOL

35:06.130 --> 35:07.860
FOR ANOTHER YEAR.

35:07.900 --> 35:09.970
OH, OK.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.840
AND THEN IF THEY CAN'T PROVE
BY THEN THAT THEY'RE WORTH
BEING KEPT OPEN,

35:12.870 --> 35:14.000
IT'S A WRAP.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.500
-YEAH.
-WHEW.

35:15.540 --> 35:17.140
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

35:19.070 --> 35:21.410
WIN THE STATE
CHAMPIONSHIP NEXT YEAR.

35:22.980 --> 35:25.010
COME ON, MAN.

35:25.050 --> 35:27.050
AIN'T NOBODY SHUTTING
DOWN THE HOME OF
THE STATE CHAMPS.

35:27.080 --> 35:31.090
YEAH. THAT'S
A LOT OF WEIGHT ON
YOUR SHOULDERS, SON.

35:31.120 --> 35:35.460
YEAH, I CAN HANDLE IT
WITH THE RIGHT COACH.

35:37.490 --> 35:40.900
MAYBE ONE WHO NEVER GOT
TO WIN STATE WHEN HE
WAS A STUDENT HERE

35:40.930 --> 35:42.600
WITH HIS BEST FRIEND.

35:55.410 --> 35:57.980
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

35:58.010 --> 35:59.650
DEAD SERIOUS.

35:59.680 --> 36:03.520
COME COACH FOR ME HERE,
ON YOUR HOME FIELD,

36:03.550 --> 36:05.920
RUNNING THE PROGRAM
YOUR WAY.

36:10.590 --> 36:12.260
THIS FEELS VERY FAMILIAR.

36:12.290 --> 36:13.460
IT SHOULD.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.300
WE HAD
A SIMILAR
CONVERSATION

36:15.330 --> 36:17.330
ALMOST
A YEAR AGO.

36:17.370 --> 36:19.640
AND I TOOK A RISK,
AND I BET ON YOU.

36:21.370 --> 36:23.940
SO WHAT'S UP, COACH?

36:23.970 --> 36:27.280
YOU WILLING TO TAKE
A RISK AND BET ON ME?

36:35.720 --> 36:37.190
OH, WOW.

36:49.130 --> 36:52.370
I THOUGHT I TOOK
TAMIA COOPER OFF
MY APPROVED VISITORS LIST.

37:09.880 --> 37:12.350
WHAT YOU
DOING HERE, MO?

37:12.390 --> 37:15.820
WELL, THAT'S NO WAY
TO GREET AN OLD FRIEND.

37:15.860 --> 37:21.400
DID YOU REALLY THINK
THAT I WOULD LET SOMEONE
MURDER MY BABY BROTHER

37:21.430 --> 37:23.360
AND I WOULDN'T
COME BACK TO TOWN?

37:23.400 --> 37:26.500
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.
TYRONE'S GONE.

37:26.530 --> 37:29.040

HIM OUT IS IN CUSTODY.

37:29.070 --> 37:30.470
RUTH SCOTT MAY HAVE
PULLED THE TRIGGER,

37:30.500 --> 37:32.470
BUT SHE DIDN'T TAKE HIM
DOWN ALONE.

37:32.510 --> 37:35.880
YOU LEFT THIS LIFE
A LONG TIME AGO, MO.

37:35.910 --> 37:38.450
DON'T DO THIS.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.050
WE BOTH KNOW HOW
IT'S GONNA END.

37:41.980 --> 37:45.950
