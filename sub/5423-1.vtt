01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:49.954
It doesn't matter where they're going.

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:54.125
What matters is deciding to get on.

01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:12.643
CONDUCTOR [MUFFLED]:
Merry Christmas!

01:27:16.315 --> 01:27:17.565
What?

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:23.237
Merry Christmas!

01:28:31.723 --> 01:28:36.143
Wake up. Wake up.
Santa's been here. Santa's been here.

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:37.979
Hurry up. Hurry up!

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:41.482
Mom, Dad, wake up. Wake up!

01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:44.652
Santa's been here! Santa's been here!

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:48.739
Mom, Dad, look!
He brought us all kinds of stuff!

01:28:48.907 --> 01:28:51.409
Look, a train!

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:13.347
SARAH: This is the most beautiful-est,
most wonderful-est Christmas ever.

01:29:13.515 --> 01:29:15.766
Wait. Look.

01:29:17.102 --> 01:29:18.936
Here's one more.

01:29:20.522 --> 01:29:22.398
Has your name on it.

01:29:39.458 --> 01:29:41.667
[BELL RINGS]

01:29:46.423 --> 01:29:48.466
[BELL RINGS]

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:53.888
SANTA:
Found this on the seat of my sleigh.

01:29:54.056 --> 01:29:56.724
Better fix that hole in your pocket.

01:29:56.892 --> 01:29:58.142
Mr. C.

01:30:05.817 --> 01:30:07.985
[BELL RINGS]

01:30:08.153 --> 01:30:11.322
MOM: Oh, what a beautiful bell.
Who's it from?

01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:13.574
- Santa.
- Santa?

01:30:13.742 --> 01:30:15.326
Really?

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:18.829
- Oh, that's too bad.
DAD: - What's this?

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:22.333
Broken. Huh?

01:30:22.501 --> 01:30:24.668
Sorry about that, sport.

01:30:27.631 --> 01:30:29.006
[BELL RINGS]

01:30:29.216 --> 01:30:32.343
MOM: Come on, kids.
We don't wanna be late.

01:30:40.352 --> 01:30:43.854
NARRATOR: At one time,
most of my friends could hear the bell.

01:30:44.022 --> 01:30:48.109
But as years passed,
it fell silent for all of them.

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:53.531
Even Sarah found, one Christmas, that she
could no longer hear its sweet sound.

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:55.366
Though I've grown old...

01:30:55.534 --> 01:30:57.952
...the bell still rings for me.

01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:02.206
As it does for all who truly believe.
