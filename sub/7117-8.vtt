No. Well...
Nah.

02:14.230 --> 02:16.300
Why'd you cast trina as the lead girl?

02:16.300 --> 02:17.700
I didn't want to.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.310
Y'know my cuddle me Cathy doll

02:20.310 --> 02:21.740

02:21.740 --> 02:23.040
No, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.810
You've never mentioned that, Tori.

02:25.810 --> 02:28.450
Oh... Well, trina kidnapped her
and she wouldn't give her back

02:28.450 --> 02:31.280
unless... ...
Unless you gave trina the lead.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.250
Yep.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.480
That's janked up.

02:33.490 --> 02:36.050
Yeah. But uhhh...
Don't ya think you're a little "old"

02:36.060 --> 02:37.390

02:37.390 --> 02:37.890
Right?

02:37.890 --> 02:40.890
I know.

02:40.890 --> 02:42.390
Okay, we're all good.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.500
Foon-yee can take me at five.

02:44.500 --> 02:47.530
Well, that's fantastic news.

02:47.530 --> 02:48.900
You go to foon-yee?

02:48.900 --> 02:50.700

02:50.700 --> 02:51.870
She bleaches my feet!

02:51.870 --> 02:52.840
Ah! No way!

02:52.840 --> 02:54.170
Oh my God!

02:54.170 --> 02:55.070
Sinjin.

02:55.080 --> 02:58.940

Heeeeyy, trina.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.150
What?

03:01.150 --> 03:03.980
You wanna know my two
favorite things about you?

03:03.980 --> 03:05.280
Ah!

03:05.290 --> 03:06.750
Trina!

03:06.750 --> 03:08.550
You don't know what I was gonna say!

03:08.560 --> 03:11.890
Shut it, puppet.

03:11.890 --> 03:14.760
Ah, so listen...
About your script... Yeah?

03:14.760 --> 03:19.530
Why did you change all
my lines to alien words?

03:19.530 --> 03:25.840
Well, it's not 'cuz I
think you're a bad actor.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.140
Duh.

03:27.140 --> 03:31.710
So can't I say some of
my lines in American?

03:31.710 --> 03:36.210
Well, I just felt like...
You're such an amazing actor...

03:36.220 --> 03:40.850
You don't even need real words to be great.

03:40.850 --> 03:43.020
Yeeeaaaah, I get it.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.920
Unh! Say it in alien.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.370
Atta girl.

I was just sayin' that...

05:07.930 --> 05:09.160
I know what you were saying.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.900
Kev! I just... look, if you think
my sister's a freaky weirdo,

05:11.900 --> 05:14.800
then why don't you just say so?!

05:14.800 --> 05:15.870
You liking it so far?

05:23.850 --> 05:25.480
Don't chew like that.

Get out! Get outta here!

05:29.750 --> 05:32.820
You got your wish!

05:32.820 --> 05:35.860
I thought he was my friend.

05:35.860 --> 05:38.690
But anyone who'd call my
adopted sister a "weirdo"

05:38.690 --> 05:41.390
is no friend of mine.

Aw Mandy, you know I
can't understand you...

05:47.170 --> 05:49.270
Not with your speech impediment.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.070
Ahhh, you're... you're hungry!

05:54.380 --> 05:55.010
You're frightened!

05:55.810 --> 05:56.710
You're sticky?!

05:57.710 --> 05:58.480
You're canadian!

05:59.820 --> 06:00.580
You like my pants.

06:01.680 --> 06:07.290
Ohhh I don't understand!!!

06:10.290 --> 06:12.090
You want me to come closer?

06:17.670 --> 06:18.700
Whoa Mandy! Wait.

06:18.700 --> 06:31.010

06:31.010 --> 06:32.950
Tori... What do you mean

06:32.950 --> 06:33.450

06:33.450 --> 06:34.380
You wrote this play?

06:34.380 --> 06:41.490
Yeah. Ya like it?

06:41.490 --> 06:43.120
You're not of this earth?!

06:43.130 --> 06:44.090
What does that mean?!

06:44.090 --> 06:45.190
You're... ?!?!

06:45.190 --> 06:49.460
You're from another planet?!

06:49.460 --> 06:50.860
I don't believe you!

06:53.170 --> 06:53.830
Oh, c'mon!

06:53.840 --> 06:56.770
If you're an alien, why would
you pretend to be my sister,

06:56.770 --> 07:01.240
here in this simple ranch house?!

07:04.210 --> 07:07.510
Okay. Okay, then prove it!

07:07.520 --> 07:08.720
Ya ready for this?

07:08.720 --> 07:16.290
Yeah, get excited.

07:16.290 --> 07:17.190
Ooo!

07:17.190 --> 07:21.630
How did she get her feet so white?

07:21.630 --> 07:24.160
Well done, foon-yee.

07:24.170 --> 07:25.000
Oh my God! Mandy!

07:25.000 --> 07:29.640
You are an alien!

07:29.640 --> 07:30.540
Oh my gosh!

07:30.540 --> 07:36.740
How come you never told me... help!

07:36.750 --> 07:37.680
Get her down!

07:37.680 --> 07:40.950
Stop the play! Hurry!

07:40.950 --> 07:47.490
Well I guess someone
should get this on video.

07:47.490 --> 07:54.430
Grab the light thingy!

07:54.430 --> 07:59.370
Thank you for making me come to ts s play.

07:59.370 --> 08:08.780
Their poor ranch house.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.710
Please tell me it's over.

08:15.220 --> 08:16.920
It's over.

08:16.920 --> 08:19.090
Get this wall off of me.

08:19.090 --> 08:21.120
Come on, help me!

08:21.120 --> 08:22.320
Lift it!

08:22.320 --> 08:32.070
1..2..

08:32.070 --> 08:33.400
Poor trina.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.370
I just don't understand what went wrong.

08:35.370 --> 08:36.470
Don't worry.

08:36.470 --> 08:39.210
One time my brother was
in Vegas and he fell out

08:39.210 --> 08:41.240
of a fourth storey hotel
window and landed on the roof

08:41.240 --> 08:44.510
of a shuttle bus.

08:44.510 --> 08:46.710
And he was okay?

08:46.720 --> 08:51.280
No.

08:51.290 --> 08:54.020
Well...
But he's okay now?

08:54.020 --> 08:58.460
Nooooo.

08:58.460 --> 09:02.160
He's seriously messed up.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.960
C'mon c'mon, I gotta get outta here.

09:03.970 --> 09:06.470
I'm supposed to meet keeko after school.

09:06.470 --> 09:07.230
Keeko?

09:07.240 --> 09:09.600
Yeah, this girl I met at b.
F. Wangs.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.370
She's all exotic and polynesian.

09:11.370 --> 09:13.640
I gotta get outta here!

09:13.640 --> 09:15.310
I love b.F. Wangs!

09:15.310 --> 09:21.510
Have you guys heard their
bang bang noodles?!

09:21.520 --> 09:24.580
No?

09:24.590 --> 09:25.390
Bye!

09:25.390 --> 09:26.990
Ah, lane says we can't leave.

09:26.990 --> 09:31.620
Lane doesn't know about keeko!

09:31.630 --> 09:32.690
What's so funny?

09:32.690 --> 09:35.160
Are you laughing at that
video of trina getting hurt?

09:35.160 --> 09:37.400
No.

09:37.400 --> 09:40.670
I'm laughing at the comments.

09:40.670 --> 09:42.300
You posted it online?!

09:42.300 --> 09:45.100
A little bit.

09:45.110 --> 09:45.870
How's trina?!?!

09:45.870 --> 09:46.770
Is she all right?!?!

09:46.780 --> 09:50.010
How's the ranch house?

09:50.010 --> 09:52.950
Trina's banged up but she's gonna
be fine... nothing serious.

09:52.950 --> 09:54.080
Oh, thank God.

09:54.080 --> 09:54.910
Yup. Bye!

09:54.920 --> 09:56.620
No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

09:56.620 --> 09:57.750
Sit down.

09:57.750 --> 10:00.850
Whyyyy?

10:00.860 --> 10:02.660
Yeah, why do we have to be here?

10:02.660 --> 10:07.830
'Cuz. You all are suspects.

10:07.830 --> 10:10.860
Aw, not again.

10:10.870 --> 10:11.860
Suspects?

10:11.870 --> 10:13.370
For what happened to trina?

10:13.370 --> 10:14.270
Mmm-hmm.

10:14.270 --> 10:15.400
But that was an accident.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.270
Yeah.

10:16.270 --> 10:19.470
A terrible, hilarious accident.

10:19.470 --> 10:23.480
That already has seventeen hundred views.

10:23.480 --> 10:27.680
Posting videos of people's
tragedies is just mean and wrong.

10:27.680 --> 10:28.510
Yeah, no... thanks.

10:28.520 --> 10:33.190
I really appreciate your input on that.

10:33.190 --> 10:39.660
And what happened to trina...
Wasn't an accident.

10:39.660 --> 10:41.930
This is the gimbal that
connected trina's harness

10:41.930 --> 10:44.200
to the steel wires that mad] Her fly.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.400
Hey listen, I'd love to hang,
but I met this girl named keeko

10:47.400 --> 10:53.140
at b.F. Wangs and I... hey.
See this?

10:53.140 --> 10:59.650
Someone cut a notch here, and
that's what made trina fall.

10:59.650 --> 11:04.450
So... you're saying it was...
Sab-o-tage?

11:04.450 --> 11:07.650
Yeah, and according to
trina, every one of you

11:07.660 --> 11:11.760
was with her at some point,
just before the show.

11:11.760 --> 11:15.430
Man, whoever did it, you better step up!

11:15.430 --> 11:18.400
I wanna go play with keeko!

11:18.400 --> 11:19.200
Oh come on!

11:19.200 --> 11:21.230
Nobody here would do that to trina.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.870
Except you.

11:22.870 --> 11:24.070
Wh... me?!

11:24.070 --> 11:24.840
Who me?

11:24.840 --> 11:26.810
Why I would never harm
my dear sister trina!

11:26.810 --> 11:30.280
Not me, sweet Sally peaches!

11:30.280 --> 11:32.410
I don't talk like that!

11:32.410 --> 11:33.250
Whatever.

11:33.250 --> 11:34.780
I saw what happened.

11:34.780 --> 11:35.750
When?

11:35.750 --> 11:36.550
Before the play.

11:36.550 --> 11:38.350
She and trina were fighting.

11:38.350 --> 11:39.390
We were arguing.

11:39.390 --> 11:40.190
Yeah?

11:40.190 --> 11:44.060
And do all your arguments end
in "I'm gonna kill you"?

11:44.060 --> 11:45.090
Oh don't gasp.

11:45.090 --> 11:46.960
But I really didn't threaten her.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.330
Sounded like it to me.

11:48.330 --> 11:51.400
Okay, why don't you tell us
exactly what you saw and heard.

11:51.400 --> 11:54.830
Sure. Ah, let's see...
It was about twenty minutes

11:54.840 --> 11:57.840
before the play started and
I walked into the black box

11:57.840 --> 12:00.310
'cuz Robbie owed me ten
bucks and I wanted it back.

12:00.310 --> 12:01.510
Robbie.

12:01.510 --> 12:03.910
And I saw Tori and trina fighting.

12:03.910 --> 12:06.710
Trina!!! Trina!!!

12:06.720 --> 12:08.380
What?

12:08.380 --> 12:11.680
I gave you the lead in my play,
now gimme my stinking cuddle me

12:11.690 --> 12:14.150
Cathy doll back!

12:14.160 --> 12:21.660
Okay okay, just a sec, relax...
here.

12:21.660 --> 12:28.230
Where is her bonnet?!

12:28.240 --> 12:31.900
This thing?

12:31.910 --> 12:33.910
What'd you do to it?!

12:33.910 --> 12:37.040
Ahhhh, I might have blown my nose into it.

12:37.050 --> 12:40.080
Ooooohhhh you filthy skunk bag!!!

12:40.080 --> 12:46.420
I am gonna kill you so hard.

12:46.420 --> 12:54.960
Hey Tori, I brought you some pansies.

12:54.960 --> 13:00.630
Why can't I be pretty like you?

13:00.640 --> 13:03.140
That's not even close to how it happened!

13:03.140 --> 13:04.100
It's how I remember it.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.210
Yeah 'cuz you're demented.

13:06.210 --> 13:10.640
Ooo, so you think I'm pretty and demented?

13:10.650 --> 13:13.450
I never said you were pretty
and I never "punched" sinjin!

13:13.450 --> 13:15.010
But you admit you threatened trina.

13:15.020 --> 13:15.780
No!

13:15.780 --> 13:22.690
Wait... I did kinda hear you tell
trina you were gonna kill her.

13:22.690 --> 13:25.930
So did I.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.390
But if you're gonna try to
kill me, too, then all I heard

13:28.400 --> 13:30.260
was pretty music.

13:30.270 --> 13:35.430
La la la la la.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.800
Two witnesses.

13:36.810 --> 13:41.270
Oh c'mon, I know Tori and
there's no she'd ever...

13:41.280 --> 13:42.580
Aw, it's keeko!

13:42.580 --> 13:49.550
Tori's guilty, I gotta go!!!

13:49.550 --> 13:51.320
A r right, I might've said something

13:51.320 --> 13:53.290
that kinda sounded threatening,
but I didn't really mean...

13:53.290 --> 13:55.660
So you threatened her, and
then somebody just happen

13:55.660 --> 13:57.520
to cut the gimbal on her harness.

13:57.530 --> 14:00.630
I didn't punch sinjin, and I'd
never sabotaged trina's gimbal!

14:00.630 --> 14:01.230
Yes, you did!

14:01.230 --> 14:04.760
No, why would I... why... what you
saw doesn't make any sense.

14:04.770 --> 14:09.440
Hey... c'mon...
Hey! Come in.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.270
You know where nurse kotter is?

14:11.270 --> 14:12.640
No, why?

14:12.640 --> 14:18.580
I think Tori broke my jaw.

14:18.580 --> 14:24.080
Dun, dun, dunnnnn.

14:24.090 --> 14:26.820
Dun, dun, dunnnnn.
La, la, la, la, la, la.

14:33.410 --> 14:35.220
- What's wrong with you?
- Just give me a break, man.

14:35.220 --> 14:38.920
Hey. Hey. Okay okay!

14:38.930 --> 14:41.660
Sinjin...
did Tori punch you in the jaw?

14:41.660 --> 14:42.830
Well, yeah.

14:42.830 --> 14:43.560
Ha!

14:43.560 --> 14:44.230
But it was an accident.

14:44.230 --> 14:44.830
Ha!

14:44.830 --> 14:45.460
Bleeeeghhhhh!

14:45.470 --> 14:47.830
Leaaaghhh!!

14:47.840 --> 14:50.070
I think nurse kotter's in
the gym with coach Davis.

14:50.070 --> 14:54.970
I'll go to the gym.

14:54.980 --> 14:57.710
Okay... do you guys wanna
hear what really happened

14:57.710 --> 15:00.680
between me and trina
before the play started?

15:00.680 --> 15:02.080
Oh my God it's keeko!

15:02.080 --> 15:05.980
Shhhh shhhh!!!

15:05.990 --> 15:09.190
Hey girl.

15:09.190 --> 15:11.460
Mmm-hmm.

15:11.460 --> 15:15.990
Andre... shhh, shhh, shh.
Yeah.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.700
You just hang now I'll be there in a beat.

15:18.700 --> 15:21.100
All right then.

15:21.100 --> 15:27.510
Can we get through this fast, please?!

15:27.510 --> 15:30.710
Tell your story, Tori.

15:30.710 --> 15:38.080
"Tori's story"... that's so rhymie.

15:38.090 --> 15:42.550
Okay. So it was uhhh...
Twenty minutes before the play...

15:42.560 --> 15:46.630
I heard Jade come in, yelling for Robbie.

15:46.630 --> 15:51.730
Blerrrrggghhh!!!

15:51.730 --> 15:53.800
Robbie!

15:53.800 --> 15:55.730
Me want Robbie!

15:55.740 --> 15:57.740
Blerrrrggghhh!!!

15:57.740 --> 15:59.800
Oh so I'm a monster now?

15:59.810 --> 16:02.070
Let her tell it how she remembers it.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.110
Thank you.

16:03.110 --> 16:05.810
So yes, I was arguing with trina,
'cuz she wouldn't gimme back

16:05.810 --> 16:07.950
my cuddle me Cathy doll.

16:07.950 --> 16:09.980
Trina, c'mon, please?

16:09.980 --> 16:11.120
What?

16:11.120 --> 16:14.090
I gave you the lead role in my
play... so I could I please have

16:14.090 --> 16:17.820
my doll back, please?

16:17.820 --> 16:18.560
All right.

16:18.560 --> 16:23.230
Just a sec...
Here.

16:23.230 --> 16:26.570
Awww, thank you so much.

16:26.570 --> 16:32.640
Uh, I'm pretty sure she had a bonnet.

16:32.640 --> 16:35.610
Ah, whatever.

16:35.610 --> 16:38.080
Take it.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.050
Thank you.

16:40.050 --> 16:44.120
Do you know what happened to it?

16:44.120 --> 16:50.220
Yeah, I blew some snot into it.

16:50.220 --> 16:58.960
Oh my God, stop making me
laugh or I'm gonna kill you.

16:58.970 --> 17:02.170
Well, thanks for giving me
my cuddle me Cathy back.

17:02.170 --> 17:03.870
I'm so happy!

17:03.870 --> 17:06.300
Aah.

17:06.310 --> 17:09.010
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry!

17:09.010 --> 17:12.480
Yeah I'm gonna go put my alien makeup on.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.680
Move.

17:14.680 --> 17:17.349
Blerrrrrgggghhh!!!

17:17.349 --> 17:19.480
It's not my fault you spilled your coffee.

17:19.490 --> 17:26.020
Klutz.

17:26.030 --> 17:29.430
Okay, that's like the opposite
of what really happened.

17:29.430 --> 17:31.930
That's exactly what happened.

17:31.930 --> 17:34.230
Okay, hold on...Hooooold on.

17:34.230 --> 17:36.070
There is another person
here who had a reason

17:36.070 --> 17:37.370
to get back at trina.

17:37.370 --> 17:38.540
Well, it's not me!

17:38.540 --> 17:42.670
All I wanna do is go play with keeko!

17:42.680 --> 17:46.110
Who else had a motive to get back at trina?

17:46.110 --> 17:51.620
Cat.

17:51.620 --> 17:54.650
Hiiiiii.

17:54.660 --> 17:55.790
Cat?

17:55.790 --> 17:57.220
Whaty?

17:57.220 --> 17:59.490
Did you cut trina's harness gimbal?

17:59.490 --> 18:00.130
Noooooo.

18:00.130 --> 18:01.260
Why would I wanna hurt trina?

18:01.260 --> 18:02.490
'Cuz of what happened between you two

18:02.500 --> 18:04.030
right before the play started.

18:04.030 --> 18:05.100
What happened?

18:05.100 --> 18:07.070
Well, um...
Aw, no no!

18:07.070 --> 18:09.000
Now we gotta hear another
version of the story

18:09.000 --> 18:15.440
from a unique point of view?!
.. Ahhhh, hah hah.

18:15.440 --> 18:15.870
Okay.

18:15.880 --> 18:19.940
Ummmm, it was an unusually windy
day here in Los Angeles...

18:19.950 --> 18:22.010
Get to the point!

18:22.020 --> 18:24.650
Okay, uhhh, Tori had just accidentally

18:24.650 --> 18:28.150
whacked sinjin in the jaw...
And right about then,

18:28.160 --> 18:33.190
Cat was helping me with my
costume and feeling my muscles.

18:33.190 --> 18:38.500
When trina walked by and said...
Hey Robbie.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.600
Why don't you come backstage with me

18:40.600 --> 18:45.670
and, ah, help me do my makeup or...
whatever.

18:45.670 --> 18:51.280
You make me happy.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.080
Why don't you just get outta here?!

18:53.080 --> 18:53.750
Why don't you?!

18:53.750 --> 18:56.150
Ladies. Come on now.

18:56.150 --> 18:59.980
Look there's one of me... Two of you...
And seven swinging days

18:59.990 --> 19:02.350
in the week.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.920
He even makes math hot.

19:03.920 --> 19:04.590
Mmmhmm.

19:04.590 --> 19:05.460
Robbie's mine!

19:05.460 --> 19:06.260
He loves me!

19:06.260 --> 19:07.390
Ah!

19:07.390 --> 19:09.890
Ow!!! You thwacked my head!

19:09.900 --> 19:12.160
She thwacked my head!

19:12.170 --> 19:13.970
I'll get you for that, Trina Vega!

19:13.970 --> 19:23.810
I'll get you good!

19:23.810 --> 19:25.980
What?

19:25.980 --> 19:27.880
That's how it happened.

19:27.880 --> 19:30.320
It is not!

19:30.320 --> 19:33.550
Okay, Cat... tell us
what you remember.

19:33.550 --> 19:36.350
So none of you people want me
to have a pretty girlfriend,

19:36.360 --> 19:38.960
is that it?!

19:38.960 --> 19:42.190
I find myself a keeko, I
make myself a keeko date,

19:42.200 --> 19:43.600
and nobody cares!

19:43.600 --> 19:44.860
Well, that's cool!

19:44.870 --> 19:47.200
Go on, Cat, tell us what happened!

19:47.200 --> 19:48.470
And start from the beginning!

19:48.470 --> 19:53.240
Just start with Adam and
eve and go from there!!

19:53.240 --> 19:55.040
Just tell us what happened.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.440
With what?

19:57.440 --> 19:58.440
With trina!

19:58.450 --> 20:00.210
Before the play started.

20:00.210 --> 20:02.950
Oh yeah!

20:02.950 --> 20:05.920
So Tori and trina realized
that they had been tricked.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.320
So they needed to replace their furniture.

20:08.320 --> 20:15.490
And so they... they got jobs packaging Sushi...
But the Sushi

20:15.500 --> 20:22.670
was moving way too fast, ...
so Tori and trina couldn't keep up.

20:22.670 --> 20:29.510
And things got so crazy!

20:29.510 --> 20:33.510
Cat...Cat!

20:33.510 --> 20:36.780
Whaty?

20:36.780 --> 20:38.880
That didn't happen to Tori and trina.

20:38.890 --> 20:40.750
No?

20:40.750 --> 20:43.460
It happened on a tv show.

20:43.460 --> 20:45.420
Drake & Josh.

20:45.430 --> 20:47.930
Heh heh... that show was classic.

20:47.930 --> 20:48.490
Oh.

20:48.500 --> 20:51.000
Then I don't know what
happened with Tori and trina.

20:51.000 --> 20:51.930
Can I have some oatmeal?

20:51.930 --> 20:53.830
No.

20:53.830 --> 20:56.330
Well, we're not any closer to
figuring out who in this room

20:56.340 --> 20:58.070
sabotaged trina.

20:58.070 --> 21:07.410
This is...... listen all right?!

21:07.410 --> 21:10.110
Lane, you know I think you're awesome

21:10.120 --> 21:12.150
but this whole thing is insane.

21:12.150 --> 21:15.050
I mean, okay, we all know that
trina can be really annoying...

21:15.060 --> 21:15.720
Amen.

21:15.720 --> 21:16.250
Mmmhmm.

21:16.260 --> 21:16.960
Yeah.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.760
...But honestly... c'mon...
Do you think any person in this room

21:19.760 --> 21:22.960
would seriously try to hurt her?

21:22.960 --> 21:24.500
I know I wouldn't.

21:24.500 --> 21:28.300
And I don't think any of
you guys would either.

21:28.300 --> 21:32.000
Not even Jade.

21:32.010 --> 21:35.010
I might.

21:35.010 --> 21:37.380
But I didn't.

21:37.380 --> 21:41.750
But you know, some of the rigging
equipment we use is kinda old.

21:41.750 --> 21:42.280
Yeah.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.950
Right.

21:43.950 --> 21:45.850
I think it was just an accident.

21:45.850 --> 21:49.250
A terrible, hilarious accident.

21:49.260 --> 21:54.490
That now has twenty-six
thousand views.

21:54.490 --> 21:57.200
I think Tori is probably right.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.300
It looks like it was cut...
Sab-o-tage?

22:00.300 --> 22:02.530
But maybe it was just old, and it broke.

22:02.540 --> 22:06.140
So not sab-o-tage?

22:06.140 --> 22:09.710
And since trina wasn't seriously hurt...
I say we just put

22:09.710 --> 22:14.110
this whole incident behind
us and... keeeeekoooo! Keeko!

22:14.110 --> 22:15.950
Keeekoooo!

22:15.950 --> 22:19.380
I'm coming, keeko. Keeko.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.290
Now, listen!

22:26.290 --> 22:29.890
Don't you ever put me in a
situation like that, ever again.

22:29.900 --> 22:31.560
Relax, Rob.

22:31.570 --> 22:35.170
You shouldn't have cut trina's gimbal.

22:35.170 --> 22:38.440
Trina shouldn't have
whacked me in the face.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.970
Mischief is never the answer!

22:40.970 --> 22:42.740
Never?

22:42.740 --> 22:43.780
Never!

22:43.780 --> 22:45.840

22:45.850 --> 22:53.990
And if anyone ever finds
out... they won't.

22:53.990 --> 22:56.120
Nobody ever suspects the puppet.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.990
Heh heh heh heh.

22:57.990 --> 22:59.520
I thought you hated that word.

22:59.530 --> 23:00.790
It's okay if I say it.
