00:05.573 --> 00:07.675
Hey, let her go!
<i>Help, help!</i>

00:07.708 --> 00:11.011
He just walked up
and started stabbing Darius,

00:11.045 --> 00:12.680
and I don't got no idea why.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.616
It's a crime
to lie to a police officer.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.425
<i>These the biggest
earners in my stable.</i>

00:24.458 --> 00:26.227
Nice to meet y'all, man.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.129
Ruffle his feathers...

00:28.162 --> 00:29.663
nothing else.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.365
<i>Damn, I guess
Christmas came early.</i>

00:31.399 --> 00:32.700
<i>Autopsy report confirms</i>

00:32.733 --> 00:35.236
<i>Jay Mo died of a single
gunshot to the head.</i>

00:35.269 --> 00:37.538
This here? Also done.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.573
There was a nurse present
at Terry's second surgery.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.642
<i>I have reason to believe
the surgeon made a mistake.</i>

00:41.675 --> 00:43.511
We might have to adjust
our re-up schedule.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.212
I'm not giving you
an extension.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.414
Look, this chick's special,
a'ight?

00:46.447 --> 00:48.682
Dead that shit
right here, right now.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.385
You kill Meech.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.487
- Talk!
- I been workin' for Lamar.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.289
I want you to get out the game.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.724
<i>It's time to choose, Tee.</i>

01:01.629 --> 01:03.097
I said officer down!

01:03.130 --> 01:04.398
Detective Lopez sustained

01:04.432 --> 01:06.233
a massive brain hemorrhage
from head trauma.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.735
<i>I'm sorry. He didn't make it.</i>

01:30.524 --> 01:32.193
<i>Ain't nothing like</i>

01:32.226 --> 01:34.361
<i>when the weather first breaks
in the D.</i>

01:34.395 --> 01:36.831
<i>Everybody be out kickin' it,
doing their thing</i>

01:36.864 --> 01:38.699
<i>without a care in the world.</i>

01:38.732 --> 01:41.669
<i>Michigan weather,
like life, is unpredictable.</i>

01:41.702 --> 01:45.406
<i>Wait five minutes and
the temperature will change.</i>

01:45.439 --> 01:49.243
<i>But the one thing that should
never change is loyalty.</i>

02:15.269 --> 02:17.204
What happen to you?
- I'll be fine whenever

02:17.238 --> 02:19.139
you do what the fuck I said.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.741
Security on Meech is
gonna be light tomorrow

02:20.774 --> 02:22.142
when he meets his new plug

02:22.176 --> 02:24.144
at the repair shop
on High Street.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.847
Man, you think
I'm fucking stupid?

02:26.881 --> 02:28.849
Ain't no way
that bitch-ass nigga

02:28.883 --> 02:30.885
gonna be coppin' shit
without no shooters.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.286
Man, I saw his brother.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.921
Meech ain't trusting
nobody these days,

02:34.154 --> 02:35.589
especially not around no plug.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.924
How the fuck you know that?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.527
'Cause I'm fucking his boy.
Come on, now.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.462
It's easier to kill a bee
with honey than vinegar

02:41.495 --> 02:44.565
when you got that good-good.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.867
Man, this better
not be no okie-doke.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.304
I'ma scope the security inside

02:50.337 --> 02:52.740
to make it easier for you
to take his ass out,

02:52.773 --> 02:54.842
unless you worried about
doing it in your condition.

02:59.914 --> 03:01.782
<i>Just keep me posted.</i>

03:49.496 --> 03:51.999
Fuck. Fuck!

04:00.941 --> 04:02.676
<i>It's the police!</i>

04:08.649 --> 04:10.484
<i>Keep your hands
on the steering wheel</i>

04:10.517 --> 04:12.553
and don't fucking move.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.024
Young man,

04:17.257 --> 04:19.493
I need you to step out
the vehicle slowly, okay?

04:19.526 --> 04:21.495
What's the problem, Officer?

04:21.528 --> 04:22.896
- I wasn't speeding.
- It doesn't matter.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.633
Keep your fuckin' hands
where we can see 'em, okay?

04:27.034 --> 04:29.269
<i>When I open the door,
step out of the vehicle.</i>

04:30.504 --> 04:31.705
Come on.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.745
This some bullshit.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.821
I'm so tired of Ms. Khem's ass

04:47.855 --> 04:49.590
giving us
all this fucking homework.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.358
Bro, who you telling?

04:51.392 --> 04:53.527
Oh, shit, check it out.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.431
Yo, they killing it.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.334
<i>Oh, damn.</i>

05:00.367 --> 05:01.502
<i>Okay.</i>

05:05.539 --> 05:08.308
<i>Hey, check out
the moves...</i>

05:15.015 --> 05:17.051
Terry Flenory,
you need to come with us.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.519
Yo, what the hell
is this about?

05:23.357 --> 05:24.958
- Just go with them, Terry.
<i>Hey, yo, what the--</i>

05:24.992 --> 05:27.061
<i>yo, I ain't even do shit.</i>

05:31.598 --> 05:34.768
Everyone, back to class.
Back to class.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.375
Man, quit playin' and go get me
another piece of chicken.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.343
You know
my mama don't like nobody

05:43.377 --> 05:44.845
pickin' in her food
when she cooking.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.013
You know
she ain't gon' say nothing

05:46.046 --> 05:47.881
if you tell her it's for me.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.516
You know Josie loves me.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.685
I'm glad you think
somebody in this house do.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.021
Your mama love me,
your daddy...

05:54.054 --> 05:56.090
- Mm-hmm.
- Everybody.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.634
<i>What's goin on, Meech?</i>

06:07.668 --> 06:09.103
Man, what the fuck
y'all doing, man?

06:09.136 --> 06:10.671
You're under arrest,
motherfucker!

06:10.704 --> 06:12.740
Hey, get your hands off of him!
What the hell?

06:12.773 --> 06:14.808
That's some bullshit.
- What the fuck is goin' on?

06:14.842 --> 06:15.976
Get the fuck off me, man.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.145
Man, get off of him!
This some bullshit.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.847
I'm reporting this.

06:23.417 --> 06:26.386
<i>What the fuck

06:26.420 --> 06:28.088
Consequences, motherfucker.

06:28.122 --> 06:29.089
Get his ass outta here.

06:29.123 --> 06:30.591
Let's go.
- What?

06:30.624 --> 06:32.893
Man, you got me
fucked up, nigga.

06:32.926 --> 06:36.096
Really? At my mama house?

06:36.130 --> 06:39.900
Get your ass in the house.

Where the fuck

08:41.088 --> 08:42.623
- she's at anyway?
Hell if I know.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.524
<i>-Maybe she ran.</i>
- Kato didn't run.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.792
Of course
Wet Dick Willie over here

08:45.826 --> 08:46.994

08:47.027 --> 08:48.528

slick shit like that.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.967

08:54.935 --> 08:56.770
All I'm saying is, every time

somethin' fucked up goes down,

just happens to be around.

09:00.774 --> 09:01.975
<i>Yeah, I get that.</i>

yesterday, nigga,

<i>Shit. We know she ain't run.</i>

09:18.892 --> 09:21.662
But we still need to figure out
how to get outta this shit.

09:21.695 --> 09:22.763
When the hook rolled,

09:22.796 --> 09:23.964
we dumped all our shit
on the ground

09:23.997 --> 09:25.198
so it was just laying

10:31.798 --> 10:33.300

10:33.333 --> 10:35.268

10:35.302 --> 10:36.837
Yeah, Nicole
sat in that very seat

10:36.870 --> 10:39.639
and lied to my face
about who killed Darius Grills.

10:39.673 --> 10:42.876
His murder led to the crackdown
which got my officer whacked.

10:42.909 --> 10:47.381
But despite all of the shit
you got away with,

10:47.414 --> 10:49.916
baby sis is wrapped up
in the murder of a cop.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.860
You might need a step stool,
hard as you reachin'.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.361
Let's try this.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.263
If I don't get a name,

11:03.296 --> 11:05.298
I'll throw Nicole
back in the hot seat.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.167
Maybe lock her up
as a material witness

11:07.200 --> 11:08.835
and press charges
against your mom.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.370
How long you think it'll be

11:10.404 --> 11:12.739
before either of their asses
crack like an egg?

11:14.975 --> 11:16.443
Take care, Meech.
I'll see you soon.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.311
Oh, yeah?
When is that?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.447
Oh, real soon.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.986
My people found the nurse
we were talking about,

11:26.019 --> 11:28.155
and she gave her deposition.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.992
Nurse Alicia Green smelled
alcohol on the surgeon's breath

11:32.025 --> 11:33.794
<i>during Terry's second surgery.</i>

11:33.827 --> 11:35.796
I went to the hospital
and threatened to go public...

11:35.829 --> 11:37.731
And they offered
another settlement?

11:37.764 --> 11:39.232
Mm-hmm.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.242
$230,000?

11:49.276 --> 11:50.410
After fees,

11:50.444 --> 11:52.979
you'll be in the neighborhood
of $150,000.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.015
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness, Charles.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.483
<i>This is as good
as an offer</i>

11:56.716 --> 11:57.984
<i>we'll get
without going to trial.</i>

11:58.018 --> 12:00.253
And in this case,
I don't wanna chance that.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.355
So would you like
to accept the settlement?

12:02.389 --> 12:03.490
Yes.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.292
Yes, we would.
Of course we would.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.860
Great.
I'll just need the two of you

12:06.893 --> 12:08.161
and Terry to sign these papers,

12:08.195 --> 12:10.363
and we'll move
this process along.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.766
I-I'd just like to apologize

12:12.799 --> 12:15.435
and, um, say thank you.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.037
You're very welcome.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.459
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,</i>

12:39.493 --> 12:41.895
one-time had us
on some bullshit!

12:41.928 --> 12:43.163
They know. They know it.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.831
<i>That's why they had
to let our asses go.</i>

12:44.865 --> 12:46.466
And we stepping out this bitch
on some straight up

12:46.500 --> 12:47.868
mafioso-type shit.
You feel me?

12:47.901 --> 12:49.402
<i>Why are we letting 'em go?</i>

12:49.436 --> 12:51.138
Because we didn't bust
any of them with drugs

12:51.171 --> 12:52.806
and got nothing for the DA

12:52.839 --> 12:54.508
to make a case
on Lopez's murder.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.877
<i>Then why did we
pull them off the street?</i>

12:56.910 --> 12:59.012
<i>Because one
of our own was killed.</i>

12:59.045 --> 13:01.148
Like watching
a shitty-ass toilet overflow.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.883
<i>Thanks for the visual.</i>

13:02.916 --> 13:04.284
I don't want
any of these assholes

13:04.317 --> 13:05.919
moving so much as a nickel bag

13:05.952 --> 13:07.220
without us
raining down on them.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.055
That entire area
stays on lockdown

13:09.089 --> 13:10.524
until one of them
comes forward.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.826
<i>Dublin, Hall, I want you
on the Rec Center.</i>

13:12.859 --> 13:14.461
<i>You got it.</i>

13:14.494 --> 13:16.029
Okay. So what am I doing?

13:16.062 --> 13:18.165
I'm still not sure what side
of the field you're playing.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.867
So until further notice,
you're on desk duty.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.354
I need you to come with me.

14:01.908 --> 14:03.443
So what you tell
the po-po?

14:03.476 --> 14:04.578
Shit.

14:04.611 --> 14:05.946
Told 'em
I didn't know what the hell

14:05.979 --> 14:07.514
they was talking about.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.282
But I'ma be real.

14:09.316 --> 14:13.119
It was hard as hell lookin'
at them photos of that cop.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.055
I still can't believe
he's dead.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.490
Shit, don't trip.
You did the right thing.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.228
Thanks.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.997
Thanks for saying that.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.434
Hey, how you get wrapped up
in this life anyway?

14:29.336 --> 14:31.171
Man, me and my moms
used to get into it

14:31.204 --> 14:33.340
all the damn time

14:33.373 --> 14:36.042
to where I ended up
moving from Tennessee

14:36.076 --> 14:38.445
to stay with my pops
when I was 12 years old.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.347
He used to hustle everything.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.550
I'm talking 'bout scripps
and auto parts.

14:43.583 --> 14:44.618
So I used to just chill

14:44.651 --> 14:46.253
with him and his boys
in the basement,

14:46.286 --> 14:47.988
soaking up knowledge and shit.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.589
You know, my best friend
Roly and I,

14:49.623 --> 14:51.191
we used to drive
all the way to the Eastside

14:51.224 --> 14:53.627
and go check out Maserati Rick
and his crew at the carwash

14:53.660 --> 14:55.962
- to peep game.
- Damn, my pops and them

14:55.996 --> 14:58.198
used to always
talk about that spot.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.400
Shit, we used to be
over there all the time.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.035
Shit, I probably knew
your pops.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.136
What's his name?

15:03.169 --> 15:05.105
Cliff. Clifford Forday.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.207
But everybody
used to call him C-Luv.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.677
That's what's up.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.313
Who he used to run with,
the Delray Boyz?

15:13.346 --> 15:16.616
Nah, it was the BKs, I think.
Somethin' like that.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.551
Now that's a blast
from the past.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.320
It should be.

15:20.353 --> 15:23.290
Shit, a gang of Black dudes
calling themselves

15:23.323 --> 15:24.291
the Black Killers?

15:24.324 --> 15:25.992
- What?

15:26.026 --> 15:28.928
Man.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.231
You a good soldier, Kato.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.932
You work hard

15:32.966 --> 15:35.635
and you got a good head
on your shoulders.

15:35.669 --> 15:37.504
Thanks.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.006
That means a lot
coming from you.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.279
What up, doe?

15:46.313 --> 15:48.148
Shit, I'm on my way.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.384
Just got a hit on Lamar.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.720
He holed up in a spot
on Joy Road.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.026
I would say
that this is hurting me

16:00.060 --> 16:02.562
more than it's hurting you,
but... I'd be lying.

16:04.030 --> 16:04.998
Okay. Almost there.

16:05.031 --> 16:06.032
- Almost there.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.134
Almost there. Almost there.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.004
Fuck! Ow!
Just hurry the fuck up.

16:11.037 --> 16:12.272
So what,
you want me to hurry up

16:12.305 --> 16:13.506
and do a fucked up job?

16:13.540 --> 16:16.576
Or do you want me to take
my time and get it right?

16:16.609 --> 16:18.478
Relax. It's almost done.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.282
See? Hard part is over.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.985
That wasn't bad.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.093
Dawg, ain't you supposed
to cover these people

16:33.126 --> 16:34.494
with sheets or something?

16:34.527 --> 16:37.197
Man, that's gonna block
my eye candy.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.165
You see the titties
on that bitch?

16:39.199 --> 16:41.201
God damn, that's my baby
right there.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.036
You fuckin' sick
in the head.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.473
You ain't got no pain meds
or something?

16:46.506 --> 16:48.041
Pain med--

16:48.074 --> 16:51.211
Do--do it look like
anybody here'd need pain--

16:51.244 --> 16:53.380
Raise your hand
if you need pain medicine.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.148
Raise your--

16:55.181 --> 16:58.618
raise your hand
if you need pain medicine.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.755
Looks good, though.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.290
All right, now get
the fuck out of here.

17:07.627 --> 17:11.431
Oh, yeah, and one more thing.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.736
Get his ass a lollipop.

17:16.770 --> 17:19.472
- Hell nah.
- Man, get out of here.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.541
Hey, yo, bro,
we was rollin' over to Rouge

17:21.574 --> 17:23.510
and we saw the Thunderbird
Lamar been whipping around in.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.278
What happened to his other car?

17:25.311 --> 17:27.046
Look like he ditched
that shit with the devil

17:27.080 --> 17:29.349
fucking an angel ornament.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.284
He in there,
'cause there's blood

17:31.317 --> 17:32.786
all in this muh'fucker, man.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.554
Shit, let's go get
this motherfucker then.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.523
No, let's get this nigga.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.358
<i>Music in Detroit

<i>And I ain't just talkin'

17:41.327 --> 17:44.130

comfy before we get it in.

Let me--ooh, that is a
motherfucking areola!

18:04.184 --> 18:06.319
Now, what the fuck type
of freaky-ass shit is this?

18:06.352 --> 18:10.089
Yo, this is a motherfuckin'
mortuary, nigga,

18:10.123 --> 18:11.858
so have some fucking respect.

talking about respecting--

18:16.563 --> 18:18.164
- Wha--
- We looking for Lamar.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.733
Well, this is Coco.
This is Tanya.

18:20.767 --> 18:24.437
I'm Alvin, and I don't know
who Lamar is.

Check every casket and room
in this toe-tag bash

18:26.639 --> 18:28.241

18:29.442 --> 18:30.777
If that nigga in here,

18:30.810 --> 18:33.847

You dropped somethin'.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.370
What's this?

18:59.205 --> 19:02.175
Pastor Swift suggests I think
about starting a car service.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.711
Now you taking advice from him?

19:04.744 --> 19:07.180
You know I've been talkin'
about this for a minute now.

19:07.213 --> 19:10.550
Babe, this money is Terry's.
It's not ours.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.353
And that's if he decides
to accept the settlement.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.587
He don't deserve it.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.656
After what him and his brother
put us through?

19:16.689 --> 19:20.493
Baby, what's for us
will be for us.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.729
And whatever Terry decides
to do with that money,

19:22.762 --> 19:24.531
that's on him.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.232
We gon' be fine.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.548
And that right there
is dominos, bro!

19:44.517 --> 19:46.319
Hey, yo, yo, yo,
hold up, hold up.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.888
I been thinking 'bout names
for the crew.

19:48.922 --> 19:50.790
What y'all think
about the Mafia Family?

19:50.823 --> 19:53.893
Ooh, shit. That's fresh.
Y'know, that's how we roll.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.395
<i>Right.</i>
- Tight like a family.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.630
Except we ain't Italian though.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.732
- We Black, motherfuckers.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.301
So?

20:01.334 --> 20:03.503
Ain't no Black Italians around
this motherfucker nowhere?

20:03.536 --> 20:04.837
- Dawg, stop while you ahead.
<i>A'ight.</i>

20:04.871 --> 20:08.775
<i>Both y'all. 15.</i>

20:08.808 --> 20:10.276
<i>I know your fat ass
ain't talkin',</i>

20:10.310 --> 20:11.744
<i>wearin' that baby powder
and shit.</i>

20:11.778 --> 20:14.280
What took y'all so long?

20:14.314 --> 20:16.382
Somebody called
with a bead on Lamar.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.418
But he was on some Casper shit
for real.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.454
Man, fuck Lamar.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.790
We need to concentrate
on moving these damn bags.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.592
Yo, Capone and Gotti,
come help me count this.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.226
You ain't
my damn boss.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.861
Man, it's all good.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.967
You know, time's running out.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.336
We got two days
to re-up, nigga.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.738
Shit, we might
just have to bounce.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.006
How the Eastside looking?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.808
<i>Gravy,
if we find a spot.</i>

20:41.841 --> 20:44.243
But there is a local crew
that roams the area.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.012
It's better to deal with them
than one-time, nigga.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.847
Yeah, but they probably
not finna to just roll over

20:47.880 --> 20:49.015
without no funk shit.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.284
Yeah, well,
that's what I'm counting on.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.754
<i>Terry, here's
your settlement check.</i>

20:57.557 --> 20:59.292
The money will be held
in a trust for Terry

20:59.325 --> 21:00.526
until he turns 18.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.762
<i>He can't spend it before then.</i>

21:03.763 --> 21:05.031
I'm--I'm sorry.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.966
I just wanna make sure
I'm hearing this correctly.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.602
You're saying that nobody
in the family

21:09.636 --> 21:11.437
has access to the money?

21:11.471 --> 21:12.672
Parents can invest the money

21:12.705 --> 21:14.507
with permission
from the surrogate's court.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.309
Wait, wait, wait, hold up.

21:16.342 --> 21:18.711
So a doctor messes up my sight,

21:18.745 --> 21:20.346
and the money
that I was awarded,

21:20.380 --> 21:21.881
I can't do anything with

21:21.914 --> 21:24.517
without the permission
of a judge or my parents?

21:24.550 --> 21:25.752
Like, how the hell
is that fair?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.620
It's not.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.989
It's a mess the man is trying
to pull to keep us in the dark.

21:30.023 --> 21:32.291
If y'all wanna spend money,
come to an agreement.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.793
I can help you get permission
from the judge.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.795
This some bullshit.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.530
Charles...

21:42.802 --> 21:45.705
Mrs. Flenory, this is
actually a nice settlement

21:45.738 --> 21:47.674
your family can use
for years to come.

21:47.707 --> 21:48.808
Congratulations.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.376
Thank you.

22:00.753 --> 22:01.988

$50 worth of crack.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.002
Nigga, not from us.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.570

22:17.603 --> 22:19.572
Come on. You know that.

22:24.510 --> 22:27.413
You said there was
a local crew out here.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.816
You know who supplies 'em?

22:29.849 --> 22:31.784
No.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.034
My man, let me holla
at you real quick.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.903
Boy, if you don't get the fuck
out my face, man...

23:23.936 --> 23:25.671
Why don't you take me
to your boss?

23:25.705 --> 23:26.806
Shit, you're looking at him,

23:26.839 --> 23:29.408
you Billy Dee-lookin'
motherfucker.

23:29.442 --> 23:30.610
Shit, I doubt that.

23:30.643 --> 23:31.878
It's clear you carrying weight,

23:31.911 --> 23:35.081
so if you the boss,
you ain't that damn smart.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.649
Smart enough.

23:36.682 --> 23:39.051
Yo. Ain't no disrespect.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.920
I'm just statin' facts.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.022
Now, what would
your real boss say

23:43.055 --> 23:44.724
if he found out
that I tried to offer him

23:44.757 --> 23:47.994
a better price
and purer weight,

23:48.027 --> 23:50.596
but you fucked it up?

23:50.630 --> 23:52.632
Where would that put
your ass at, huh?

24:03.576 --> 24:05.578
- Yes, sir!
- Oh!

24:19.759 --> 24:21.194
Y'all know each other?

24:21.227 --> 24:22.795
Yeah, I know 'em.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.564
<i>Man, fuck them
light-skin niggas.</i>

24:24.597 --> 24:26.899
Man, shut up, Saint. Meech!

24:26.933 --> 24:30.169
Terry, baby. What's up?
What's going on?

24:30.203 --> 24:32.738
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I want you to meet Tracy.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.207
Y'all gettin' in on the action?

24:34.240 --> 24:35.808
Well, damn, give me a minute.

24:35.842 --> 24:37.476
Let me check
the lay of the land first.

24:37.510 --> 24:38.945
<i>Hey, man, you
talking all this shit.</i>

24:38.978 --> 24:40.680
Man, pick up them dice.
Roll them dice, bro.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.014
For what nigga?

24:42.048 --> 24:43.482
I'm gon' keep
cracking your head

24:43.516 --> 24:44.650
like I been doing all night.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.190
Let's do this, all right? 20.

24:51.224 --> 24:54.193
No, matter of fact,
make it 40 on 6-8.

24:54.227 --> 24:55.895
<i>Ooh.
- You got that?</i>

24:55.928 --> 24:56.963
Double up.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.831
- Damn.
- Oh, shit.

24:58.865 --> 25:00.566
I ain't gonna be
stupid like y'all.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.034
Come on, Ponytail. I got a 5.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.103
You can bet that shit.

25:04.136 --> 25:05.238
Ooh, crazy no more.

25:05.271 --> 25:06.939
See y'all niggas getting
a little money.

25:10.576 --> 25:13.112
God damn! See, that's why--

25:13.145 --> 25:14.513
- Yeah.
- It's your fault!

25:14.547 --> 25:15.915
Yeah, baby.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.950
That what I'm talking 'bout.
That what I'm talking 'bout.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.819
Yeah, man. Yeah, yeah.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.922
- You know what I'm saying?

25:22.955 --> 25:24.891
<i>Hey Meech, let me rap at you.</i>

25:29.562 --> 25:30.897
Man, I hate sitting down

25:30.930 --> 25:32.865
and chopping it up
after a loss.

25:32.899 --> 25:35.668
Wins and losses
are part of this.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.237
You gon' get both if you keep
fucking around in this game.

25:38.271 --> 25:40.306
You know, me and Tee
walked away from Pat

25:40.539 --> 25:42.842
'cause we was tired of losing.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.176
Yeah.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.712
Yeah, I heard about that.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.815
So is that why you been
roaming around town

25:49.849 --> 25:51.217
fuckin' up my business?

25:51.250 --> 25:53.319
Look, we actually trying
to do the opposite, nigga.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.620
What's that?

25:54.654 --> 25:57.089
We trying to bring you
more business.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.829
Nigga, do I look like
I need some more business?

26:05.064 --> 26:06.265
Come on, man.

26:06.299 --> 26:08.801
I like the fact
that you even had the audacity

26:08.834 --> 26:10.636
to try to even make this play.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.138
Shit, that's the only way
you get ahead.

26:12.171 --> 26:15.741
And trust me when I tell you,
me and Tee,

26:15.775 --> 26:18.177
we gon' do exactly
what we tell you we gon' do.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.046
Yeah, I know.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.248
I can see it in your eyes.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.286
Stay the fuck out my lane.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.922
Hey, Boom, you ever heard
of an old head named C-Luv?

26:29.956 --> 26:31.590
Used to roll with the BKs?

26:31.624 --> 26:34.193
Oh, yeah.
That crazy motherfucker?

26:34.226 --> 26:36.162
But yeah,
that nigga wasn't no BK.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.730
He was with the Delray Boyz.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.665
Lamar Silas used to roll
with them too?

26:39.699 --> 26:41.701
Hell yeah.
Both they crazy asses.

26:43.669 --> 26:44.804
Cool.

26:44.837 --> 26:47.039
<i>Hey, remember
what I said, Meech.</i>

27:01.887 --> 27:04.056
I'm tired as hell.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.625
Yeah, Meech got us
all grindin' like crazy.

27:07.994 --> 27:09.662
You think he's onto us?

27:09.695 --> 27:12.031
Nah, I woulda
heard about that.

27:12.064 --> 27:15.034
I was nervous as hell
when he said, "Come with me."

27:15.067 --> 27:16.402
I thought you sold me out.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.337
Hmm. Is that right?

27:18.371 --> 27:20.306
Wha--I mean, y'all go way back.

27:20.339 --> 27:21.707
I don't know.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.876
Look,
Meech is like fam, a'ight?

27:23.909 --> 27:26.012
But he can't make me
feel like you do.

27:32.918 --> 27:35.054
What are we gonna do
about Lamar?

27:35.087 --> 27:37.056
We missed our shot yesterday,
and it's not like

27:37.089 --> 27:40.092
I'm tryin' to call this nigga
again and set up another meet.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.794
Let's use the one
you still got.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.229
I mean, you told him
Meech is meeting up

27:43.262 --> 27:44.730
with a plug tonight, right?

27:44.764 --> 27:46.165
Yeah, but I made
that shit up on the fly.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.300
Lamar don't know that.

27:49.702 --> 27:53.039
So--so we just play
like we still on?

27:53.072 --> 27:54.407
Hell yeah.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.741
Then I'll show up
to the meeting

27:55.775 --> 27:57.043
instead of Meech.

27:57.076 --> 27:59.378
Kill his ass. Simple.

27:59.412 --> 28:01.247
Mm.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.815
Mmm.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.250
You...

28:04.283 --> 28:06.118
are a very...

28:06.152 --> 28:07.286
smart boy.

28:07.319 --> 28:09.321
Mm.

28:11.157 --> 28:13.159
I got it all worked out. Trust.

28:15.461 --> 28:16.929
Uh, uh.

28:16.962 --> 28:19.265
But don't miss or get
picked up by the cops again,

28:19.298 --> 28:21.000
all right,
'cause he'll kill my ass.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.269
Tell that motherfucker
to meet you at Visger Bar

28:23.302 --> 28:25.905
for a celebratory drink
after he kills Meech.

28:25.938 --> 28:28.841
That way, if anything
goes down, Lamar'll show up.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.043
But you already got
the drop on him.

28:32.278 --> 28:35.848
Look, don't trip, a'ight?

28:35.881 --> 28:37.283
I'll page your ass
as soon as I kill

28:37.316 --> 28:39.718
that crazy-ass motherfucker.

28:39.752 --> 28:40.853

29:06.312 --> 29:08.781
<i>Jay Freedman lives here.
He owns a car service.</i>

29:08.814 --> 29:10.449
<i>Sometimes I drive for him
on the weekend.</i>

29:10.483 --> 29:12.118
Charles, we talked about this.

29:12.151 --> 29:14.487
We talked about us
using the settlement money.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.088
This would be for Terry.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.458
Now why doesn't this man
have his own office?

29:19.492 --> 29:20.993
Jay's wife got sick last year,

29:21.026 --> 29:22.828
so he began working from home.

29:22.862 --> 29:25.197
Now he's selling this business
so he can devote all his time

29:25.231 --> 29:28.067
to taking care of her,
and business ain't bad.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.270
He makes about $85 a day after
paying for the driver and gas.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.805
Oh, wow.

29:32.838 --> 29:35.941
That's, like--that's 600 a week
with just four cars.

29:35.975 --> 29:40.012
That man's clearing

- K annually.

29:40.045 --> 29:42.548

29:42.781 --> 29:45.551
That's what makes this
a solid business investment.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.186
So you're trying
to bring me in on this?

29:47.219 --> 29:49.922
Like I said, the goal
is to give this to you.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.991
I could drive until
you get the proper license,

29:52.024 --> 29:54.793
and your mom could quit working
at the restaurant and help out.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.235
Terry, this could be
your way out

30:03.269 --> 30:04.970
for you and your family.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.573
<i>This could be a win-win

30:07.806 --> 30:09.008
Black folks rarely
have businesses

30:09.041 --> 30:10.910
to pass down to they kids.

30:10.943 --> 30:13.245
I know I ain't got
nothing for y'all.

30:13.279 --> 30:14.580
This would be an opportunity
for you

30:14.813 --> 30:17.516
to do that for Terry Jr.

30:23.289 --> 30:26.926
Yeah, I hear you, Pops, I do,

30:26.959 --> 30:29.595
but I just--I need time
to think about all this.

I just fixed your speaker.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.957
And put in that stash spot
you asked about.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.058
Oh, yeah?

huh?

31:10.970 --> 31:13.072

31:43.335 --> 31:44.670
I already know.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.673
I appreciate you,
dawg, for real.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.541
I appreciate you.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.477
Everything you've been doin'
with us, man.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.146
If I could get these fools
to be as half as loyal as you,

31:54.179 --> 31:57.049
yo, we'd already be
running this fucking city.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.921
Look, I need
to tell you something.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.557
Kato's been working with Lamar.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.493
I already knew.

32:07.526 --> 32:10.162
<i>I had to check the loyalty
around me and my brother.</i>

32:10.195 --> 32:11.664
What?

32:11.697 --> 32:14.967
What the hell you was gon' do
if I ain't told you?

32:15.000 --> 32:16.502
Look, she came to me

32:16.535 --> 32:18.370
because she don't wanna fuck
with Lamar no more.

32:18.404 --> 32:19.972
But Kato wasn't going down
like that,

32:20.005 --> 32:22.174
so we came up with a plan
to pop Lamar's ass

32:22.207 --> 32:24.343
at the repair shop
on High Street.

32:24.376 --> 32:27.980
That crunchy-ass
Black motherfucker is crazy,

32:28.013 --> 32:29.982
but he ain't no goddamn fool.

32:30.015 --> 32:32.685
He woulda have seen
that shit a mile away.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.092
Unless we want him to.

32:45.097 --> 32:47.199
So what'd you find out
about ol' girl?

32:47.232 --> 32:49.201
She straight.

32:49.234 --> 32:51.070
What about your boy Lamar?

32:51.103 --> 32:53.038
Still got a bounty on his head.

32:54.573 --> 32:57.242
I heard you got that
settlement, Terry Flenory.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.678
Did Mom and Pops
try to convince you

32:59.712 --> 33:02.381
to put that shit
to college or some shit?

33:02.414 --> 33:04.516
Nah, not at all.

33:04.550 --> 33:06.518
Yeah, right, nigga.

33:09.355 --> 33:12.558
So look, what you think
about BMF?

33:12.591 --> 33:13.992
<i>The hell that stands for?</i>

33:14.026 --> 33:16.195
Big Meech Flenory, nigga?

33:16.228 --> 33:17.296
Hell nah, nigga.

33:17.329 --> 33:20.332
You think
I'm conceited or something?

33:20.366 --> 33:22.000
Don't answer that.

33:22.034 --> 33:24.636
BMF stands
for Black Mafia Family, fool.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.739
<i>And it represents
everything we about, Tee.</i>

33:26.772 --> 33:28.674
Shit, we Black,

33:28.707 --> 33:31.577
our crew is structured
like the mafia,

33:31.610 --> 33:34.146
and we all a family.

33:34.179 --> 33:37.082
A'ight.
Yeah, I mean, it's a'ight.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.784
Nah, that shit is dope as fuck.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.386
- I ain't gonna lie.
- Yeah, you know it.

33:40.419 --> 33:42.054
That shit is dope.

33:42.087 --> 33:44.256
Hey, yo, we killed it
running out of the store.

33:44.289 --> 33:45.724
Yeah, and I made
a little deal with Saint

33:45.758 --> 33:48.394
promising five keys of his own
to smooth shit out.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.062
Nigga, that's all our shit.

33:50.095 --> 33:51.163
I know, Tee.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.332
Shit, we could always cop more.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.566
Look, if you don't wanna do it,

33:54.600 --> 33:56.568
take me to Big L,
and I'ma do it myself.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.504
No. No. Ain't shit happening.

33:58.537 --> 34:01.707
You see, that's the difference
between us.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.409
You always asking
for permission

34:03.442 --> 34:05.244
instead of just taking
what's rightfully yours.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.678
Niggas would still be slaves
or riding

34:06.712 --> 34:08.380
in the back of the bus
fucking with a nigga like you.

34:08.414 --> 34:10.115
If we piss this lady off...

34:10.149 --> 34:12.785
We not, a'ight?
Just bring me with you.

34:12.818 --> 34:15.254
I promise I'm gonna get us
double the work we had.

34:15.287 --> 34:18.223
God damn. All right. Fine.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.321
Man, this bitch done set me up.

35:03.302 --> 35:06.271
You tried to play me.
Get your motherfucking ass up.

35:06.305 --> 35:07.840
C'mon. Let's go.

35:10.175 --> 35:12.478
- Get your fucking hands off me.
- Cause a scene if you want.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.346
I will smoke you and everybody
else in this bitch.

35:14.379 --> 35:15.647
Lamar, let me explain.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.549
You tried to lure me there
so your boyfriend

35:17.583 --> 35:19.284
could pop my ass, huh?

35:19.318 --> 35:20.486
No. No, Lamar--

35:20.519 --> 35:21.820
You think I'm fucking stupid?

35:21.854 --> 35:23.689
<i>I know you are,
Black motherfucker.</i>

35:27.626 --> 35:29.461
You think
we actually give a fuck

35:29.495 --> 35:31.230
about a rat bitch
workin' for you?

35:37.469 --> 35:40.138
I'm sorry, Kay.

35:40.172 --> 35:43.542
Man, ain't this a bitch?
Nigga used you to get to me.

36:11.904 --> 36:13.372
Look at me, motherfucker.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.910
Did you shoot
my fucking brother?

36:19.711 --> 36:22.281
Don't even matter, nigga.
You already dead.

36:23.849 --> 36:26.351
I'ma watch your ass suffer.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.501
<i>I love you.</i>

36:53.812 --> 36:56.315
I love you too, boo.

37:03.288 --> 37:06.592
Yo, B. B, we gotta go. Now!

37:19.705 --> 37:21.707
<i>I fucked up, Meech.</i>

37:21.740 --> 37:23.642
<i>I can't believe
I killed my baby.</i>

37:28.747 --> 37:31.483
She would've broke your heart
sooner or later.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.385
Sometimes it's better
to just rip the Band-Aid off

37:33.418 --> 37:34.453
and deal with the pain.

37:34.486 --> 37:35.721
That's coming
from a motherfucker

37:35.754 --> 37:37.823
who don't love nobody
but his goddamn self.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.859
Kato was the first girl
I loved.

37:43.695 --> 37:45.597
And I burnt that shit
for your ass.

37:45.631 --> 37:46.698
<i>B, we family.</i>

37:46.732 --> 37:48.567
And family do
whatever they gotta do

37:48.600 --> 37:49.668
to protect one another.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.903
Man, fuck you.

38:04.316 --> 38:06.585
Mama, how you doing?

38:07.853 --> 38:10.355
Brian, I don't want you
driving like this.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.557
Now, you go lay
on that couch, you hear me?

38:12.591 --> 38:14.559
A'ight, that's what I'll do.

38:17.029 --> 38:18.463
Sorry for being here.

38:18.497 --> 38:19.831
His girlfriend just
broke up with him.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.668
That's why you turned my house
into a den of iniquity?

38:22.701 --> 38:26.672
I was just passing through.

38:31.076 --> 38:32.444
I notice your guards

38:32.477 --> 38:34.579
<i>aren't in front
of the house anymore.</i>

38:35.947 --> 38:38.383
Y'all don't have
nothing else to worry about.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.554
What have you done, Demetrius?

38:42.587 --> 38:44.089
<i>Protected our family.</i>

38:46.692 --> 38:48.927
Mama, this ain't your fault.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.862
That don't make me
feel no better.

38:53.365 --> 38:56.535
I don't know
who the hell you are anymore.

38:57.602 --> 38:59.538
I'm still your first born.

39:00.806 --> 39:02.407
I promise.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.076
Yes, you are.

39:07.379 --> 39:10.849
But you broke that seal
a long time ago.

39:38.076 --> 39:39.911
What the fuck is this place?

39:39.945 --> 39:41.947
This is where Big L
keep all her shit.

39:43.515 --> 39:44.783
Check this out.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.818
Yo, Mee--Meech, c'mon.
Stop being like a little kid

39:46.852 --> 39:48.386
in a candy store.
Put that shit down.

39:48.420 --> 39:49.621
Nigga, I can't help it,
all right?

39:49.654 --> 39:51.156
I'm geek. Fuck.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.791
You don't even know
what happened last night.

39:52.824 --> 39:54.059
<i>Last night?</i>

39:54.092 --> 39:57.129
Hell no. God damn!

39:57.162 --> 39:59.531
That piece is from Japan's
Shigaraki Kilns

39:59.564 --> 40:02.000
during the 19th century
Meiji period.

40:02.033 --> 40:05.403
And it costs $250,000.

40:05.437 --> 40:06.838
<i>So unless you plan
on buying it,</i>

40:06.872 --> 40:08.940
I suggest you take your hands
off my merchandise

40:08.974 --> 40:11.109
and get the hell out
of my gallery.

40:11.143 --> 40:12.911
I don't do business
with you, Meech.

40:12.944 --> 40:15.847
Not directly,
but my hands have been

40:15.881 --> 40:17.549
on every fucking dollar
in that bag

40:17.582 --> 40:18.917
that my brother's
about to give to you,

40:18.950 --> 40:20.585
so I think
that I'm connected enough

40:20.619 --> 40:22.621
to tell you that our business
is expanding.

40:22.654 --> 40:25.624
<i>But we need more product.
Ten keys should suffice.</i>

40:25.657 --> 40:27.726
And we'd love
to continue expanding

40:27.759 --> 40:29.661
our business together.

40:32.197 --> 40:33.832
Get the fuck outta here

40:33.865 --> 40:35.133
<i>before I splatter
your motherfucking ass</i>

40:35.167 --> 40:37.669
and make a new art piece
out of your blood.

40:40.172 --> 40:42.808
Cool. I get the picture.

40:50.148 --> 40:53.018
If you ever disrespect me
like that again,

40:53.051 --> 40:55.854
your brother's blood won't be
the only one getting shed.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.956
Everything Meech said
was the truth.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.858
I don't give a fuck.

40:59.891 --> 41:01.693
Ten keys is a big ask for a man

41:01.726 --> 41:04.529
who was just asking for an
extension the last time we met.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.598
Yeah, well,
we the top dogs of Southwest,

41:06.631 --> 41:08.033
and now we branching off
to the North end

41:08.066 --> 41:09.601
and the Eastside.

41:15.941 --> 41:18.643
<i>Terry, are you sure
this is what you wanna do?</i>

41:19.845 --> 41:23.014
Hell yeah.

41:23.048 --> 41:24.216
Good.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.251
That's exactly
what I needed to hear.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.119
<i>Carl will get you started.</i>

41:28.153 --> 41:29.187
Thanks.

41:31.056 --> 41:33.525
There's no limit to where
this partnership can go,

41:33.558 --> 41:36.928
provided you continue to value
the terms of our agreement.

42:05.891 --> 42:08.159
<i>Damn, girl.
You clean up well.</i>

42:08.193 --> 42:09.861
Nice teamwork.

42:09.895 --> 42:11.830
All day, but that shit
ain't gon' last.

42:22.007 --> 42:25.310
Please help me take down Lamar.
Baby, we can do this together.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.980
B, just you and me.

42:34.185 --> 42:36.554
Fuck. Shit.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.611
Can you get
out the car, please?

43:01.012 --> 43:03.248
What's the problem, Officer?

43:03.281 --> 43:05.317
I said get out the fuckin' car.

43:11.690 --> 43:13.692
Now, close the door, nigga.

43:16.962 --> 43:18.897
Get used to this position.

43:18.930 --> 43:22.000
Come on.

43:44.122 --> 43:46.858
Ooh, shit!

43:46.891 --> 43:48.960
God damn, she actually
gave it to us?

43:48.994 --> 43:50.895
Now, look, gather
the whole crew, nigga.

43:50.929 --> 43:53.131
We 'bout to go celebrate.
This is epic.

43:53.164 --> 43:55.800
You just say this is epic?

43:55.834 --> 43:57.869
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, Meech.

43:57.902 --> 44:00.038
We still got this whole Lamar
shit hanging over our heads.

44:00.071 --> 44:02.640
He ain't seeing
no more birthdays thanks to me.

44:02.674 --> 44:03.975
Are you happy
about that, Meech?

44:04.009 --> 44:05.844
<i>Hell fuck, yeah.
I'm happy about that shit.</i>

44:05.877 --> 44:07.846
And you should be trying
to party and celebrate with me

44:07.879 --> 44:09.014
instead of trying to play

44:09.047 --> 44:10.682
Darnell the fucking Downer,
nigga.

44:10.715 --> 44:12.417
We done got everything
we coulda ever asked for.

44:12.650 --> 44:15.687
Lamar's dead as fuck.
Nigga, we just got ten keys.

44:15.720 --> 44:16.821
<i>We're on our way to becoming</i>

44:16.855 --> 44:18.923
<i>the kings
of the motherfucking D.</i>

44:18.957 --> 44:20.025
Hey, look, I'm out.

44:20.058 --> 44:21.726
You ain't about the rain
on my parade.

44:40.378 --> 44:42.814
<i>What do you want
to talk to us about, son.</i>

44:46.051 --> 44:49.721
So I've been--I've been
thinking a lot about...

44:49.754 --> 44:52.257
what you guys been saying about
everything that's been going on

44:52.290 --> 44:55.994
and--yo, where you going?

44:56.027 --> 44:58.463
Terry Jr. and I
are gonna go live

44:58.696 --> 45:00.932
with my cousin in Pennsylvania
for a few months.

45:00.965 --> 45:02.767
A few months?

45:02.801 --> 45:04.035
What the hell
you talking about?

45:04.069 --> 45:06.304
I gave you the opportunity
to make a choice,

45:06.337 --> 45:08.807
but I didn't think
it'd take this long.

45:08.840 --> 45:11.209
I didn't wanna rush
my decision, Wanda,

45:11.242 --> 45:12.477
so I took my damn time.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.746
Well, this is my answer, Terry.

45:16.281 --> 45:18.349
Now I need to take
some time to think

45:18.383 --> 45:20.218
and figure out
what I wanna do, okay?

45:20.251 --> 45:21.386
- No, no, no.
Terry.

45:21.419 --> 45:22.854
No, you ain't
taking my son.

45:22.887 --> 45:24.389
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey now.

45:24.422 --> 45:26.191
You can't keep her
against her will.

45:26.224 --> 45:27.459
Fuck that.

45:27.492 --> 45:29.160
She can't take my son away
from me either, pops.

45:29.194 --> 45:32.297
Hey, hey.

45:32.330 --> 45:34.799
<i>Come on, Lawanda.
I'll walk you out.</i>

45:39.170 --> 45:41.473
Fuck.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.275
Don't worry.

45:44.309 --> 45:46.211
It's all gonna work out, okay?

45:46.244 --> 45:49.180
Ma, this is some bullshit.

45:58.523 --> 45:59.958
Who you think this is?

45:59.991 --> 46:01.793
Meech or Terry?

46:01.826 --> 46:04.129
Got 100 says Meech.

46:07.465 --> 46:10.401
It's Ronald
motherfucking Reagan, nigga.

46:10.435 --> 46:12.070
Now can I fucking leave?

46:12.103 --> 46:14.239
No, not until
I get some answers.

46:14.272 --> 46:16.040
Look, we been
through this, a'ight?

46:16.074 --> 46:17.375
So what, some fool saw my car

46:17.408 --> 46:20.211
leaving Visger Bar
and Grill last night?

46:20.245 --> 46:21.846
That don't mean
I had anything to do

46:21.880 --> 46:24.115
with Lamar getting capped.

46:28.086 --> 46:30.054
<i>Pulled that from your car</i>

46:30.088 --> 46:32.190
<i>in that bogus stash spot.</i>

46:32.223 --> 46:34.392
See, it don't matter
that we can't pin you

46:34.425 --> 46:36.794
to Lamar Silas' murder.

46:36.828 --> 46:38.863
Our ballistics
connected your gun

46:38.897 --> 46:40.198
<i>to the murders
of Catherine Eda</i>

46:40.231 --> 46:42.867
<i>and James Williams.</i>

46:42.901 --> 46:44.469
Never heard of 'em.

46:44.502 --> 46:45.937
Jay-Mo.

46:45.970 --> 46:48.006
Yeah, see, a funny,
thin nigga like you,

46:48.039 --> 46:50.308
oh, you gonna be
a hit in prison.

46:50.341 --> 46:53.411
Or that gun could get misplaced
on its way back evidence.

46:56.047 --> 46:57.949
What type of game
you trying to run here?

46:57.982 --> 47:00.818
Ain't no game. Man, I don't
give a fuck about you.

47:00.852 --> 47:03.188
I want Meech.

47:03.221 --> 47:05.290
Help me get him,
or I'ma make sure

47:05.323 --> 47:07.192

both these charges.

47:10.061 --> 47:13.431

47:13.464 --> 47:14.999
Tick tock.

47:20.505 --> 47:22.173

47:22.207 --> 47:24.142
You eating street meat
instead of a Coney?

47:24.175 --> 47:25.577
Yeah, I just left my lawyer's.

47:25.610 --> 47:27.478
I was thirsty,
so I grabbed a pop.

47:27.512 --> 47:29.581
Where the fuck is everybody at?

47:29.614 --> 47:32.550
I canceled the meeting.

47:32.584 --> 47:34.986
A'ight, check this shit out.
Look at this shit, nigga.

47:36.387 --> 47:38.389
- Damn.

47:38.423 --> 47:40.625
BMF.

47:40.858 --> 47:42.126
Yo, you really on your way

47:42.160 --> 47:43.628
to becoming the King
of Detroit, Meech.

47:43.861 --> 47:46.431
Man, fuck the D, nigga.
We takin' over the nation.

47:46.464 --> 47:47.932
And then the whole
fucking world.

47:47.966 --> 47:49.467
- Shit.
- Yeah.

47:55.306 --> 47:56.874
Yo, Meech.

47:56.908 --> 47:59.177
What's up?

48:01.012 --> 48:04.549
What?

48:04.582 --> 48:06.417
I'm out.

48:06.451 --> 48:08.620
I'm gonna use
my settlement money

48:08.653 --> 48:11.122
to invest in a family business.

48:11.155 --> 48:13.291
Me and Pops are starting
a car service.

48:15.627 --> 48:16.995
Nigga, what?

48:17.028 --> 48:19.297
Why would you leave
something you good at

48:19.330 --> 48:22.133
to do some shit you ain't
never done in your life?

48:23.234 --> 48:24.902
Ha.

48:24.936 --> 48:26.938
All right, fuck it, man.

48:26.971 --> 48:28.539
Guess this car shit
is the move then.

48:28.573 --> 48:30.608
Duke just put a stash spot
in my whip, so shit.

48:30.642 --> 48:32.277
I could have him lace
all the cars

48:32.310 --> 48:34.979
- in your business to move shit.
- I'm not doing that.

48:35.013 --> 48:38.049
I'm not doing
any of this shit anymore.

48:38.082 --> 48:39.651
Yo, Lawanda's
pressuring you, bro?

48:39.684 --> 48:42.020
This had nothin'
to do with her.

48:42.053 --> 48:43.454
Nor you, for the matter.

48:43.488 --> 48:45.023
This is about me

48:45.056 --> 48:47.091
and what the fuck I want
out of my life.

48:47.125 --> 48:49.360
After everything
we've been through to get here,

48:49.394 --> 48:51.362
you're doing this now?

48:51.396 --> 48:53.398
Just tell me why.

48:53.431 --> 48:55.500
I wanna use this settlement

48:55.533 --> 48:57.502
to build a legacy
for our family.

48:57.535 --> 48:59.437
And what your dumb ass
think we been doing?

48:59.470 --> 49:02.573
Meech, I'm not gettin'
shot at or locked up anymore.

49:02.607 --> 49:04.642
I'm not.

49:04.676 --> 49:06.244
You my baby brother.

49:06.277 --> 49:07.712

than anybody else

49:07.945 --> 49:09.947

49:09.981 --> 49:12.984

hold you over, nigga.

49:13.017 --> 49:14.585
We hustlers.

49:14.619 --> 49:17.288
And you love this money
as much as I do.

49:17.322 --> 49:20.425
It's in our fuckin' blood.

49:20.458 --> 49:23.227
And we damn sure
the shit at it,

49:23.261 --> 49:24.962
especially when we together.

49:24.996 --> 49:27.031
Can't nobody fuck with us.

49:30.068 --> 49:32.437
I'm sorry, bro. I'm out.

49:35.707 --> 49:38.042
How are you gon' bounce on me
and we still got Big L?

49:38.076 --> 49:39.577
You know she ain't gonna
fuck with me.

49:39.610 --> 49:41.512
That's not my problem anymore.

49:43.047 --> 49:45.516
Don't fuckin' walk away
from me, Tee.

49:46.751 --> 49:48.986
You gon' walk away
from your brother?

49:51.122 --> 49:53.057
