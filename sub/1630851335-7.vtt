00:05.965 --> 00:07.800
"Only 3% of all mammals on Earth,

00:07.883 --> 00:10.553
including homo sapiens,
are actually monogamous.

00:10.636 --> 00:14.390
Bonobos, which are the closest apes
to humans, are not."

00:34.994 --> 00:36.537
Look at this beauty!

00:37.913 --> 00:38.914
Wow!

00:39.415 --> 00:42.501
- What's that supposed to be?
- An "M" for Mica.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.378
Looks like a dead snake.

00:44.462 --> 00:46.380
It isn't a dead snake.

00:47.465 --> 00:48.507
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.765
Is everything okay?

00:56.432 --> 00:59.769
- Everything okay, honey.
- I had a bad night's sleep.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.813
I'm just making pancakes.

01:04.106 --> 01:05.649
Eat them all, okay?

01:18.621 --> 01:19.789
Can you drive me?

01:20.414 --> 01:21.832
Sure, honey.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.251
Let's go.

01:25.294 --> 01:27.713
- Come on, sweetheart.
- Bye, honey.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.298
Have a nice day.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.302
Come on, let's go.

01:38.057 --> 01:39.975
OV7 FOREVER.
SEE YOU TONIGHT.

01:46.148 --> 01:49.360
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
CAN WE MEET LATER?

01:53.614 --> 01:54.865
Hey, babe.

01:55.699 --> 01:59.328
Gala invited us to an erotic poetry
reading, do you want to come?

02:02.081 --> 02:04.166
I can't. I have plans.

02:04.834 --> 02:08.587
- What kind of plans?
- Men stuff, you know.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.843
I need to get back to the office.

02:15.094 --> 02:16.262
I'll see you later.

02:21.225 --> 02:23.060
THE GAME OF KEYS

02:23.394 --> 02:24.812
Leo, please!

02:25.271 --> 02:27.690
- Stop!
- You have to come, babe.

02:28.983 --> 02:31.694
Oh, yeah.

02:37.116 --> 02:39.034
Oh, yeah.

02:50.421 --> 02:52.298
That was great, babe.

02:54.884 --> 02:57.303
Uncuff me, please. I need to...

02:58.053 --> 02:59.680
- I have to go.
- Okay, okay.

03:01.307 --> 03:03.893
- And the keys?
- Come on!

03:05.269 --> 03:07.104
Relax, honey!

03:08.772 --> 03:10.316
But you enjoyed it though, right?

03:11.984 --> 03:13.986
Good.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.035
- You know what I feel like?
- I don't know.

03:21.285 --> 03:24.747
- You're being demanding.
- I want role-playing again.

03:25.414 --> 03:26.707
But this time...

03:27.583 --> 03:29.168
I choose.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.713
Then, choose something hot.

03:39.929 --> 03:41.221
I have an idea.

03:44.683 --> 03:48.020
We raised a lot of money
for cancer research in children.

03:48.854 --> 03:50.814
Significant breakthrough
is being achieved.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.692
- Excellent!
- That's good. Very good.

03:54.318 --> 03:55.986
I think it's great
that you want to care

03:56.070 --> 03:57.529
for all the children in the world.

03:58.948 --> 04:02.201
- But you don't want your own?
- Does anyone want more lemonade?

04:02.493 --> 04:04.787
- Thanks.
- Tell me something.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.958
Have you thought who will inherit
your fortune when you die?

04:09.083 --> 04:11.669
- It has chia seeds.
- No. Thanks.

04:11.752 --> 04:16.131
I don't need to think about it.
You remind me on a daily basis.

04:19.218 --> 04:22.429
And I'll keep doing it
every single day.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.765
Until you finally make up your mind

04:25.224 --> 04:27.351
and do the only thing
we've asked you to do...

04:27.434 --> 04:28.769
Let me finish, please.

04:29.144 --> 04:32.982
Seems like you're still determined
to live like you were a young kid.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.317
Believing that you'll always have
money available...

04:35.401 --> 04:37.486
-Ernesto. Ernesto.
-What is it, Gaby?

04:38.529 --> 04:40.447
Valentín and I will have babies.

04:40.990 --> 04:42.992
But whenever we want to.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.704
If you agree, fine.
And if you disagree, that's fine too.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.166
Shall we go, babe?

04:51.959 --> 04:52.876
Let's go.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.754
Come on, Chata.

04:56.255 --> 04:57.548
Take care.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.217
Come on.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.386
Bye, Chata.

05:05.597 --> 05:06.890
"If you agree, fine.

05:07.266 --> 05:09.435
And if you disagree,
that's fine too."

05:14.398 --> 05:18.360
I swear I've never heard anyone
talk to my old man like that before.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.571
Did you see his face?

05:21.238 --> 05:22.573
His reaction?

05:23.907 --> 05:26.910
He was speechless
for the first time ever.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.954
Totally speechless.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.498
My God, Gabriela Albarrán!

05:33.000 --> 05:34.126
I love you.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.003
I'd be lost without you.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.014
Good afternoon.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.183
Adriana!

05:49.391 --> 05:51.727
Hey, Barbs! What are you doing here?

05:53.520 --> 05:57.775
Well, Siena texted me.
She needed to see me.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.360
- That's funny. Me too.
- What are you doing here?

06:02.237 --> 06:04.239
Probably same as you.

06:04.615 --> 06:06.742
-Siena?
- She's so fucking weird.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.500
- Everything all right?
- Yes. Why?

06:15.167 --> 06:16.376
Just asking.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.296
Because...

06:20.839 --> 06:23.592
Oh, right. Everything was fine.

06:23.926 --> 06:28.305
Let's just say it was
like an explosive... situation.

06:30.349 --> 06:31.725
Yeah, gross.

06:32.935 --> 06:34.019
How about you?

06:34.686 --> 06:37.898
Fine. As usual.
Just like the last time. You?

06:37.981 --> 06:39.775
How was it with Sergio?

06:40.484 --> 06:41.985
Nothing unusual.

06:42.903 --> 06:43.946
Really.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.323
- Boo!
- Jeez!

06:47.282 --> 06:48.742
You scared me.

06:49.618 --> 06:52.246
You're probably wondering
why I needed to see you.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.082
The thing is,
I'm having my birthday party

06:55.165 --> 06:58.335
and I want to have you
as my special guests.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.045
A Game of Keys.

07:00.796 --> 07:04.675
Imagine a mansion full of rooms.

07:04.842 --> 07:08.470
Everyone wearing masks.
No one knows who is who.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.931
- Men...
- Women...

07:11.056 --> 07:12.891
- Threesomes...
- Foursomes...

07:12.975 --> 07:13.851
Gala!

07:14.143 --> 07:17.104
- What?
- Anything is possible.

07:17.563 --> 07:20.941
- Just sex.
- Unlimited lust.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.734
- Boobs...
- Asses...

07:22.818 --> 07:23.861
Dicks...

07:24.903 --> 07:25.946
What do you think?

07:26.363 --> 07:28.031
- Gang sex.
- Great.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.159
Tell your spouses.
I'll see you there.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.625
- Can you explain?
- These girls are fucking crazy.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.170
- Shall I take your order?
- Tequila for me.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.130
- Okay.
- Triple.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.215
Fucking game.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.759
I don't know whether I like it
or it scares me.

07:48.802 --> 07:52.055
Now I'm only missing
your husband, and you.

07:53.849 --> 07:57.019
With my luck,
I'll get an 80 year old man

07:57.102 --> 07:59.062
with erectile dysfunction
and chlamydia.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.440
- That's so gross!
- Indeed.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.902
New clients?

08:07.029 --> 08:08.739
Bárbara, come here.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.157
What?

08:10.741 --> 08:15.078
- This girl is...
- Aurelia Ortiz-Villalobos.

08:15.871 --> 08:19.082
- Daughter of the billionaire politician.
- Right.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.918
She's mine.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.961
- Bárbara, wait!
- What?

08:23.128 --> 08:24.963
- You reek of Tequila!
- Do I?

08:25.047 --> 08:26.298
Yes, you do.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.134
I'll have a cup of coffee.

08:29.801 --> 08:30.761
Listen.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.305
We can't screw it up.
It could be quite a deal.

08:33.388 --> 08:34.806
Go get them, girl!

08:37.434 --> 08:40.395
And that's why we do what we do.
We do love our job.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.358
Our mission is to plan every wedding
as if it were our own.

08:44.441 --> 08:48.445
We are aware that every client
is special and unique.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.322
This is why we take care of every detail.

08:52.783 --> 08:56.912
I don't know. Everything you're saying
sounds so unexceptional.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.540
I want my wedding to be unmatched.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.502
I want something wild, eccentric...

09:04.002 --> 09:05.545
outrageous.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.006
I see.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.760
- Thanks.
- I can see your point.

09:11.885 --> 09:16.306
We've got a lot of wild ideas
that are a perfect match for your needs.

09:16.515 --> 09:17.766
- For example?
- Like...

09:17.849 --> 09:19.351
Did I hear wild?

09:20.560 --> 09:24.064
- This is Bárbara, my business partner.
- Please, let me.

09:24.398 --> 09:28.443
I heard you were mentioning
our wild, eccentric weddings.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.905
Nothing can be more eccentric
than Vegas.

09:32.155 --> 09:35.325
Getting married in Vegas is a cliché.

09:36.326 --> 09:39.830
I'm not talking about going to Vegas.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.416
I mean bringing Vegas here.

09:42.499 --> 09:47.879
Imagine a venue emulating
the finest casino in Vegas.

09:48.005 --> 09:50.757
Baccarat and roulette tables...

09:51.133 --> 09:52.884
Burlesque strippers...

09:53.010 --> 09:55.762
- A priest disguised as...
- Elvis Presley.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.932
Of course.
And international performers.

09:59.391 --> 10:02.227
Remember when we had
Celine Dion here?

10:02.519 --> 10:05.814
Right. But it's too expensive.
I think...

10:06.315 --> 10:08.108
that'll exceed their budget.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.360
- Too expensive.
- Mhm.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.863
My parents are going to hate it.

10:16.199 --> 10:17.242
I love it.

10:17.868 --> 10:21.580
You are geniuses. That's just what
we were talking about this morning.

10:21.872 --> 10:24.458
- I think I love you!
- Good for you.

10:26.335 --> 10:27.878
- So nice meeting you.
- Excuse us.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.130
- We'll be in touch.
- Goodbye.

10:46.480 --> 10:50.067
CAN WE TALK, VALENTÍN?
WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING MY TEXTS?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.778
Chata! Come here!

11:02.871 --> 11:06.375
That's it! Good job!

11:10.087 --> 11:14.049
Regardless of your dad's pressure...

11:15.050 --> 11:17.052
do you...

11:18.470 --> 11:19.721
want to be a dad?

11:23.475 --> 11:24.643
Gaby, please.

11:25.811 --> 11:29.189
You too want to know who's getting
the Lombardos' fortune?

11:29.231 --> 11:31.733
Don't be silly.
That's not the reason I'm asking you.

11:31.817 --> 11:32.859
So?

11:34.403 --> 11:35.779
Someone will inherit it.

11:37.656 --> 11:38.782
She's the only one.

11:39.282 --> 11:40.867
Our baby girl. Right, honey?

11:41.660 --> 11:44.204
She'll inherit it. Let's go.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.530
You should do as Carmen says.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.824
Or you'll suffer the consequences.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.047
Welcome home, macho.

12:36.506 --> 12:40.719
Welcome. Now that you are here,
you may spank me.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.557
- I forgot my keys.
- Carmen!

12:45.640 --> 12:47.893
The kids are with my parents.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.770
They must be here somewhere.
In the kitchen.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.481
I'll look in the living room.

12:52.689 --> 12:53.773
Here!

12:54.232 --> 12:55.442
Thank God!

12:56.610 --> 12:57.611
Thanks, Carmen.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.823
Thanks.

13:02.699 --> 13:03.867
- I have to go.
- Yes.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.160
Good evening.

13:05.702 --> 13:06.912
Bye. Have a good night.

13:10.707 --> 13:11.917
Fuck!

13:22.219 --> 13:23.762
It's your turn.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.388
Good. Jump!

13:27.349 --> 13:28.558
- No.
- No.

13:28.683 --> 13:29.809
I have to go.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.145
Where are you going
dressed like that?

13:32.395 --> 13:34.272
To an OV7 concert.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.858
With your friends, or what?

13:37.317 --> 13:38.360
No.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.153
Sergio invited me.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.864
Dad, pay attention.
We're being killed.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.576
See you later.

13:49.621 --> 13:50.830
Enjoy, Mom!

13:51.581 --> 13:52.624
I will!

13:53.625 --> 13:55.919
Come on, Dad.

13:57.963 --> 13:59.256
Well done!

14:00.549 --> 14:02.926
Look! It's Mica's present.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.679
- I'll take it to her.
- Now?

14:05.762 --> 14:07.222
Yes, now. Sorry.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.143
Okay. Take care.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.272
- Come on.
- Hi, Pedro!

14:15.730 --> 14:17.399
- Hello, Gaby.
- What are you doing here?

14:17.732 --> 14:20.777
I have Chata's food.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.698
- Pedro is here, baby!
- I know. Send him in.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.663
What is it?
We have enough dog food.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.915
Yes, I know.

14:34.666 --> 14:37.168
But you didn't return my texts and...

14:38.920 --> 14:42.716
Well. Actually, I wanted
to apologize for kissing you...

14:44.593 --> 14:45.760
It wasn't cool.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.263
It was.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.600
I mean, you took me by surprise,
but...

14:52.100 --> 14:53.768
you helped me understand.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.228
Really?

14:57.480 --> 14:58.523
Like what?

14:58.773 --> 15:01.192
I don't want to talk about it. That's
why I didn't return your texts.

15:01.276 --> 15:03.612
Listen. It happens often.

15:05.322 --> 15:06.781
Why don't you come with me?

15:07.699 --> 15:08.783
Where?

15:09.492 --> 15:11.161
- You'll have fun.
- Where?

15:11.244 --> 15:12.579
- Let's go.
- Now?

15:12.621 --> 15:13.955
Now. I'll leave this here.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.961
- Hi.
- What's up, Gaby?

15:20.712 --> 15:22.464
I got Mica's present.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.257
What a nice surprise.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.426
- May I?
- Sure. Come in.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.762
- How have you been?
- Fine.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.642
- Is Adriana home?
- No.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.226
Okay.

15:35.727 --> 15:36.936
Come in.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.108
Godmother!

15:43.068 --> 15:45.737
- I hope you like it. Sorry for the delay.
- Thanks!

15:47.238 --> 15:48.239
Open it.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.076
Are you staying for dinner?

15:52.827 --> 15:54.204
I don't think so.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.665
Join us! Pizzas will be here any minute.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.127
Where did you find this?
I couldn't get it anywhere.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.798
- Thank you!
- Look at this!

16:13.223 --> 16:16.685
- Come on! Dad, please. Not now.
- What's that?

16:16.893 --> 16:19.270
- Why not?
- Dad, please. Not now.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.773
- This is so lovely.
- What's that?

16:22.482 --> 16:25.068
- It's a family tradition, Mica.
- It's so embarrassing.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.028
Oh, come on, Mica.

16:27.112 --> 16:29.114
- Look at that...
- Gaby?

16:29.572 --> 16:31.908
- Come with me.
- Mica, please.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.828
We need to talk girls' stuff.

16:35.412 --> 16:36.788
We'll be right back.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.460
- Tell me.
- Don't leave me here!

17:06.151 --> 17:07.569
This is a gay club.

17:12.073 --> 17:13.241
What next?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.619
Pull your pants down.
Someone will suck your dick.

17:17.746 --> 17:20.081
I'm joking, man.
Let's get a drink.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.378
Whisky, please.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.259
- Whisky for you?
- Yes.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.261
Two whiskies, please.

17:34.637 --> 17:37.098
- Pedro! It's been a long time.
- Hi!

17:37.223 --> 17:38.600
How are you?

17:39.350 --> 17:41.436
And you? I've never seen you around.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.773
- No. It's my first time.
- In town?

17:46.316 --> 17:47.734
No. Here.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.738
Welcome to your new world.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.490
I'm Daniel.

17:56.451 --> 17:57.535
I'm Valentín.

17:57.827 --> 17:58.912
Thanks.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.623
I wouldn't call it a date.

18:02.373 --> 18:04.167
I think it's more like,

18:04.501 --> 18:08.129
"You're a movie nerd, and I'd like
to have a good time with you."

18:08.463 --> 18:10.590
Okay. You said he was tense.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.467
That he is a Capricorn,

18:13.051 --> 18:14.969
and he just invited you.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.473
Then, it's a date. He likes you.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.310
Claudio likes me?

18:23.603 --> 18:26.731
But he is the coolest guy in school.

18:26.856 --> 18:30.109
Exactly!
And you're the coolest girl in the world.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.779
You're bright, beautiful,

18:32.987 --> 18:35.031
nice, and cool.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.535
Thank you, Gaby. Really.

18:39.327 --> 18:42.622
You're amazing.
You're like my second mom.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.056
Among so many nasty guys,

21:05.139 --> 21:08.685
finding someone who's not a psychopath
is like hitting the jackpot.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.522
Being told I'm not a psychopath

21:13.648 --> 21:16.526
is the most romantic thing
I've ever heard in my life.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.528
- Really?
- Yes.

21:20.154 --> 21:21.447
I've had a great time.

21:22.782 --> 21:23.866
Me too.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.369
And I want to see you again.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.180
Call me.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.141
Okay?

22:08.369 --> 22:10.204
- Follow me.
- Where are you taking me?

22:10.288 --> 22:12.123
We've got our backs to it.

22:12.623 --> 22:14.876
Relax. I have a surprise for you.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.757
- Guys, this is Adriana.
- Hello!

22:20.923 --> 22:23.134
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.220
- Nice meeting you.
- Hi!

22:26.345 --> 22:28.681
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hello.

22:29.432 --> 22:30.767
We loved your concert.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.561
Can we take a picture?

22:33.686 --> 22:35.104
Say "cheese".

22:36.898 --> 22:39.025
- Another one, please. Just in case.
- Sure.

22:40.902 --> 22:43.988
- This is the worst.
- Look at your shirt.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.700
- This is you and Mica.
- My sweet girl.

22:48.409 --> 22:51.370
It's crazy. You've always been
a part of our lives.

22:53.289 --> 22:54.665
Of my life.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.918
But I've always seen you...

22:57.585 --> 22:59.212
as Adriana's friend.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.507
But being honest, Gaby.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.842
I'm so attracted to you.

23:10.264 --> 23:11.307
A lot.

23:41.379 --> 23:42.421
Hey, honey.

23:42.839 --> 23:45.591
So, what do you say?
Can we watch a movie?

23:47.218 --> 23:50.179
- You want to watch a movie? You choose.
- I do.

23:50.304 --> 23:52.223
- Which one do you prefer?
- Whatever it is.

23:52.723 --> 23:54.267
I had so much fun tonight.

23:55.059 --> 23:57.019
I had a great time. Thank you.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.439
- Me too.
- Well then...

24:03.025 --> 24:04.443
Right...

24:06.195 --> 24:07.446
Thanks for the ride.

24:09.699 --> 24:10.783
See you.

24:13.327 --> 24:14.412
Bye.

25:21.938 --> 25:23.105
My God.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.655
This was more than just sex.

26:05.022 --> 26:06.023
Hi.

26:07.191 --> 26:08.192
Hello.

26:10.111 --> 26:11.529
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

26:13.322 --> 26:15.366
I'm fine. You?

26:19.203 --> 26:20.371
Can we talk?

26:23.666 --> 26:25.001
Are you okay?

26:31.799 --> 26:33.217
You need to know something.

26:36.679 --> 26:39.348
I can't hold it inside anymore.
It's killing me.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.481
This isn't working.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.442
Right?

26:51.569 --> 26:52.862
I want you to know...

26:54.322 --> 26:55.948
that I love you very much.

26:56.490 --> 26:57.950
I love you too.

26:59.785 --> 27:00.870
But...

27:02.413 --> 27:03.581
But...

27:12.923 --> 27:17.345
I think we need a baby girl or boy.
This is such a huge house...

27:18.888 --> 27:20.389
just for the two of us.

27:23.267 --> 27:24.310
Do you mean it?

27:26.520 --> 27:28.689
I do. I want to have our baby...

27:29.607 --> 27:32.443
- running around this house.
- That's what you needed to tell me?

27:35.112 --> 27:37.031
- Yes.
- I was so scared.

27:43.621 --> 27:45.623
Okay. Let's have a baby.
