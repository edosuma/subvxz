01:47.608 --> 01:53.030
China provides 40% of the bailout,
the IMF provides another 40%

01:53.113 --> 01:57.575
and a consortium of American
and Chinese energy companies

01:57.660 --> 01:59.119
tackles the remaining 20%,

01:59.202 --> 02:02.706
in exchange for which
they get drilling rights.

02:02.790 --> 02:06.501
The US would only have
to contribute 150 of the $800 billion.

02:06.584 --> 02:09.755
Russian companies would oversee production
and get a slice of the revenues.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.799
These are the proposed development zones.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.217
We split the drilling rights?

02:14.301 --> 02:18.555
Yes, sir. China puts in more money,
but we contribute our drilling technology.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.349
Should we really be sharing that?

02:21.433 --> 02:23.143
They're already trying
to hack it from us.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.853
Has Petrov agreed to this?

02:24.937 --> 02:27.898
I'm planning to propose it to him
in Brandenburg at the G7 Summit.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.818
We've invited Russia and China to attend,

02:30.901 --> 02:34.487
but we didn't wanna move forward
until we had congressional approval.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.950
- Bob?
- We should discuss privately.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.743
You're going to Brandenburg yourself?

02:40.911 --> 02:43.789
If his health continues to worsen--

02:43.872 --> 02:47.459
We'll assess as we get closer,
but, no, I'll stay here if it looks dire.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.212
We should probably draft
an appropriation

02:50.295 --> 02:52.339
in case we need to pay
for a state funeral.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.836
- Doug.
- Madam Secretary.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.049
I could've come to the White House.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.721
The organ network, it answers to you.

03:41.764 --> 03:44.141
Yes and no.
Uh, in a regulatory capacity--

03:44.224 --> 03:46.518
You have the power to modify
the recipient list.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.561
That's up to the network.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.188
They have an expert committee that--

03:50.272 --> 03:52.900
The president's life isn't going to be
decided by a committee.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.652
Let me show you something.

04:02.492 --> 04:06.121
He was number three yesterday.
Number one got a transplant.

04:06.204 --> 04:10.500
Makes the president number two.
His chances are very good.

04:11.251 --> 04:15.088
But this man, Anthony Moretti,
he's just hours away from dying.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.173
Then let him die.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.803
I'm not doing this.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.889
It's not just the law.
It's the ethics--

04:23.972 --> 04:25.891
Then change your ethics.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.518
Or you can resign,
and your deputy can make this call.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.396
And if he won't,
then he can resign, too.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.024
I will strip away this entire department
until I find who I need.

04:40.613 --> 04:41.990
Now make the call.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.037
- Okay, I'm on.
<i>- You ever use it?</i>

04:47.120 --> 04:48.872
No, I use Google.

04:48.956 --> 04:52.209
Uh, it's a small market share, but still,
it's billions of searches a month.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.253
Now, what if a certain candidate
got more hits,

04:55.337 --> 04:59.174
<i>was ranked higher, more positive coverage
favored over negative coverage?</i>

04:59.257 --> 05:01.969
What if that candidate
was William Conway?

05:04.096 --> 05:06.473
<i>Manipulating searches?
The public would turn on them.</i>

05:06.556 --> 05:09.434
- It gets them millions of votes.
- Can you get me solid proof?

05:09.517 --> 05:11.561
<i>Well, I am not getting involved
in something like this.</i>

05:11.644 --> 05:14.481
<i>What I will give you is advice
as a friend.</i>

05:14.564 --> 05:17.150
Don't waste a year of your life
on the Underwoods.

05:17.234 --> 05:21.238
<i>They've already lost the election
and they don't even realize it.</i>

05:22.280 --> 05:24.074
I know you're only trying to help,

05:24.157 --> 05:27.035
and I'm sure you must feel
frightened about Frank's condition--

05:27.119 --> 05:28.661
You don't have to be delicate, Cathy.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.915
I'd like you to let me do my job.

05:31.999 --> 05:35.585
China cannot be at the center
of this negotiation, or Raymond Tusk.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.463
Involving the oil companies
is the only shot we have

05:38.546 --> 05:40.215
at winning Republican support.

05:41.591 --> 05:45.303
Do you remember when we played beer pong
and you let me win?

05:45.971 --> 05:48.598
The two of us were sitting
right over there, in those two chairs,

05:48.681 --> 05:51.018
and you asked me for my advice.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.352
It was good advice.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.854
And you listened to it.
I don't know why you won't now.

05:54.938 --> 05:58.150
You were proposing a way forward.
This time you're not.

05:58.233 --> 06:01.486
Well, unlike you,
my nomination was confirmed by the Senate,

06:01.569 --> 06:03.906
because they believed
I knew what I was doing.

06:03.989 --> 06:05.698
Forgive me, Claire,
but it seems to me

06:05.782 --> 06:08.035
that you are taking advantage
of the situation

06:08.118 --> 06:10.120
to assert authority
you don't have a right to assert.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.205
Cathy, you don't have Francis right now.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.958
I'm the best thing you've got,
so please work with me on this.

06:15.042 --> 06:19.296
Congress will never approve this.
You're just wasting everybody's time.

06:19.379 --> 06:23.008
- The Republicans will get in line.
- Not the Republicans, the Democrats.

06:23.091 --> 06:27.971
I spoke to Jackie Sharp.
When she heard you developed this plan...

06:28.055 --> 06:32.935
She's a formidable woman, Claire,
and very persuasive.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.783
<i>- Remy Danton.</i>
- Remy, we need to talk about Jackie.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.716
Such a nice night.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.010
Let's go somewhere outside.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.762
And where do you wanna go?

07:09.846 --> 07:11.598
Take me to the bay.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.808
We'll go skinny-dipping.

07:13.891 --> 07:17.729
- I thought you only had a couple hours.
- I'll make up some excuse.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.231
I'm sick of hotel rooms.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.318
We both got a big day tomorrow.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.820
Why are you being no fun?

07:25.903 --> 07:28.531
Because you're trying to kill my bill.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.368
You didn't wanna see me.
You wanted to lobby me.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.828
- Jackie, listen--
- Who told you I was against it?

07:36.873 --> 07:38.041
Birch's Chief of Staff.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.502
Well, I'm sure you stand to make
a lot of money on this, but--

07:40.585 --> 07:43.964
- It's not about the money.
- Isn't that how Claire convinced you?

07:47.342 --> 07:49.802
I just wanted to leave it tonight.
I didn't wanna be mad at you.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.305
I just wanted...

07:56.768 --> 07:59.271
I don't understand why you're helping her.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.232
You've gotta get Birch on board.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.986
The Underwoods have lied to me,

08:06.069 --> 08:07.904
they've used me,
they've tried to intimidate me.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.239
I don't know what Claire's up to,

08:09.322 --> 08:10.991
but I'm not gonna let it happen
without a fight,

08:11.074 --> 08:12.700
not with the State Department against it.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.202
Claire knows.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.580
About you and me.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.001
She got photographs of us

08:21.084 --> 08:24.212
leaving the same hotel at the same time,
multiple occasions.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.551
Take me back to my car.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.638
- Jackie, listen--
- Turn around now, please.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.308
It's the reason I haven't been in touch.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.559
I wanted to protect you...
but she's making--

08:38.643 --> 08:40.852
I don't wanna talk about it.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.731
Just stop the car and let me out
or drive me back.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.984
I'll take you back.

08:52.407 --> 08:53.616
A day or two.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.327
We might not have much warning,
Mr. President.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.995
When the liver is this close to failure,
things can happen suddenly.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.248
You should be prepared.

09:00.332 --> 09:03.210
- What's happening with his hands?
- It's called asterixis.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.504
It happens when the body
can't clear ammonia.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.381
Thank you, Dr. Saxon.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.915
I'm not going to Brandenburg.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.126
No, you have to.

10:26.209 --> 10:29.254
- Cathy will negotiate on my behalf.
- I don't trust her on this.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.173
That's a risk we'll have to take.

10:31.256 --> 10:35.385
The risk I won't take is being overseas
if the president dies.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.471
We don't even know if Congress will
approve the appropriation for the bailout.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.765
They will approve it.
I'll make sure they do.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.061
You shouldn't be worrying
about this now, Claire.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.979
You should be focused on Frank.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.456
We need to put him

12:28.540 --> 12:29.999
on the ventilator to protect his airways.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.377
You should go, ma'am.
Go get some rest.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.523
<i>♪ Pretty Polly ♪</i>

12:53.606 --> 12:55.983
<i>♪ Would you take me unkind? ♪</i>

13:00.322 --> 13:02.156
<i>♪ Tell you my mind ♪</i>

13:16.463 --> 13:17.839
Shh.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.686
- Now's not a good time, LeAnn.
- This can't wait.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.688
- What is it?
- Pollyhop.

13:33.771 --> 13:37.149
- The search engine?
- Conway is working with them.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.569
They can manipulate
what people search for.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.820
It gives them a huge advantage--

13:40.903 --> 13:41.988
Wait, slow down.
What does this mean?

13:42.071 --> 13:43.656
It means that we lose.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.033
Conway's name, his image,

13:46.117 --> 13:48.828
they can control what people see.
They can force-feed it.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.037
Even if they're not doing that,

13:50.121 --> 13:52.874
even if they're just tracking users,
it's enough to beat us.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.335
You know what people are searching for,
you know everything,

13:56.419 --> 13:58.295
their hopes, their fears,
what they're thinking about

13:58.380 --> 14:00.757
when they're staring at the ceiling
in the middle of the night.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.217
- Who told you this?
- Someone I trust.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.846
I can't deal with this right now.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.806
We have to do something, Claire,
or the election--

14:08.890 --> 14:11.684
LeAnn, my husband just had a seizure.
There may not even be an election.

14:11.768 --> 14:12.852
I'm sorry. I--

14:12.935 --> 14:15.062
If Francis survives,
we will deal with this then.

14:15.146 --> 14:18.232
Right now, I need to focus
on what's right in front of me.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.571
There was no criminal wrongdoing.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.323
That we can fathom.
But why take the chance?

14:26.408 --> 14:28.785
Because pleading the Fifth
makes it look like I broke the law.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.077
I agree.

14:31.078 --> 14:34.331
So I'll tell the truth.
I'll own it.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.626
Yes, that you didn't meet with him.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.087
Are you suggesting that--

14:40.171 --> 14:41.923
It's the attorney general's word
against Heather's.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.802
As your lawyer,
I can't be part of this conversation.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.679
We can still win this campaign.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.223
I'll be in the lobby.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.901
I'll back you up.

15:01.984 --> 15:05.447
The security detail
only saw me and Goodwin together,

15:05.530 --> 15:07.239
not the two of you.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.995
This is under oath.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.457
Underwood's people are trying to smear us.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.501
The whole point of this campaign
was to be the opposite of Underwood.

15:18.585 --> 15:22.422
- I thought you wanted this.
- Not if it means breaking the law.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.591
Do you think he'd even be
having this conversation?

15:26.008 --> 15:28.803
You actually care about the law,
Heather...

15:29.971 --> 15:31.848
which is why you need to be president.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.746
- Mrs. Underwood.
- Bob, I didn't realize--

15:54.829 --> 15:58.040
The Leader and I were just discussing
the bailout package.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.167
President Blythe
just wanted me to stress

16:00.251 --> 16:04.005
how important it is that the Democrats
stick together right now

16:04.088 --> 16:05.548
with Francis being--

16:05.632 --> 16:09.301
There's no need. I just called the Speaker
to schedule an emergency vote.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.138
I'm sure the president will be pleased.

16:12.221 --> 16:15.725
- How... How's Frank?
- He's hanging in there.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.434
I'm sure you wanna
get back to the hospital.

16:17.519 --> 16:20.104
But thank you for making
the personal visit.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.065
- Thoughts and prayers, Claire.
- Thank you, Bob.

16:23.149 --> 16:26.694
I'll walk you out.
Excuse me, Leader.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.791
You came here to threaten me.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.709
We don't need to be at odds, Jackie.

16:43.252 --> 16:47.006
Do you plan on hanging this over my head
every time I try to oppose you?

16:47.089 --> 16:49.300
You can't fault me for your sloppiness.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.511
That's a "yes."

16:52.094 --> 16:55.598
As long as we're working together,
you have nothing to worry about.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.439
Mr. President,
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

17:03.523 --> 17:07.527
The members of the G7 are already ruffled
because Russia was invited,

17:07.609 --> 17:10.070
and Petrov may be using this opportunity
to embarrass us

17:10.154 --> 17:12.073
in front of the international community.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.156
Yes?

17:13.240 --> 17:15.284
- <i>The First Lady is here, sir.</i>
- Send her in.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.703
Sir, I would like to finish our briefing--

17:16.786 --> 17:20.080
I'm not gonna keep the First Lady waiting
if she wants to see me.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.794
- I'm sure you've heard.
- Yes, Birch called a few minutes ago.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.130
I'd like to join you
in Brandenburg, Cathy.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.633
Well, I appreciate you
wanting to pitch in,

17:30.717 --> 17:32.051
but I really don't think that's necessary.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.220
Well, I know this plan
better than anyone.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.931
- Mr. President--
- There is only one shot at this.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.183
- Everyone at the same table.
- What about Frank?

17:40.059 --> 17:42.436
In Brandenburg, I can be useful.
I can't here.

17:42.519 --> 17:45.648
The First Lady cannot negotiate
on behalf of the United States government.

17:45.732 --> 17:49.068
The delegation is
at your discretion, Mr. President.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.362
It might be good for you
to have some support.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.240
Her presence undermines my authority
as Secretary of State.

17:54.323 --> 17:58.995
Cathy, Petrov is incredibly stubborn.
Trust me, I know.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.372
Why wouldn't you wanna have
every asset available to you?

18:02.289 --> 18:04.333
- Allow me to do this, Mr. President.
- Sir--

18:04.416 --> 18:07.879
- If it increases our chances.
- It will, I promise.

18:09.046 --> 18:12.091
Then join us.
We're going over the briefing now.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.441
You tried, Frank...

18:30.693 --> 18:33.404
which is more than most people ever do.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.657
Right now, it's just us.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.785
Rest your eyes.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.536
We have all the time in the world.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.047
Danny, what was that?

18:53.382 --> 18:56.260
- Danny?
- Nothing, Mom.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.269
Open the door.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.815
Open the door.

19:20.743 --> 19:24.163
Mrs. Underwood?
Dr. Saxon is on the line.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.667
Excuse me.

19:33.923 --> 19:34.966
Hello?

19:38.302 --> 19:40.304
Good evening,
or good morning.

19:42.056 --> 19:45.392
President Underwood
is currently being prepped for surgery

19:45.476 --> 19:47.186
to receive a liver transplant.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.731
Barring any complications,

19:49.814 --> 19:52.649
the surgery is expected to take
12 to 13 hours.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.028
<i>Uh, we'll update you
about the progress if need be,</i>

19:56.112 --> 19:59.531
<i>but probably nothing more
until the operation's completed.</i>

19:59.615 --> 20:02.702
We can turn the plane around
right now, ma'am.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.162
You'll be back
before he's out of surgery.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.249
We should do that, Claire.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.167
I'll be late to the summit,
but everyone will--

20:10.251 --> 20:12.294
No. We're almost there.

20:14.088 --> 20:16.883
- We keep going.
- Honestly, Claire--

20:16.966 --> 20:19.218
- Inform the captain to stay on course.
- Yes, ma'am.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.807
Connect me with Seth Grayson, please.

20:31.147 --> 20:34.066
He's already gone in.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.819
<i>The First Lady is currently
en route to Brandenburg</i>

20:36.903 --> 20:39.446
<i>and will not be in Washington
for the surgery.</i>

20:49.290 --> 20:55.004
<i>She will continue onto the G7 Summit
to assist Secretary Durant, as planned.</i>

20:55.087 --> 20:58.049
She asked me to read
the following statement.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.636
"It was a difficult decision
for me not to return..."

21:02.719 --> 21:06.015
But I know my husband.
If he were conscious...

21:06.098 --> 21:07.558
<i>"...he'd tell me to press on..."</i>

21:07.641 --> 21:10.853
<i>...that the best way to be
at his side is to serve my country.</i>

21:10.937 --> 21:13.647
"And I can serve it better in Germany
than in a waiting room.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.276
<i>If there's an emergency,
I'll return immediately..."</i>

21:17.359 --> 21:19.611
<i>...but I have the utmost faith...</i>

21:19.695 --> 21:21.488
"...in the medical team
at Jefferson Memorial."

21:21.572 --> 21:23.657
I'm praying for a successful procedure,

21:23.740 --> 21:28.412
<i>and I ask all of you to join me
in praying for my husband,</i>

21:28.495 --> 21:30.081
<i>your president.</i>

21:42.676 --> 21:44.553
Right over there, Ms. Dunbar.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.931
Will your attorneys
be joining us?

21:47.014 --> 21:48.891
I've asked my attorneys not to attend.

21:49.851 --> 21:52.144
We have to advise you
that it's in your best interest--

21:52.228 --> 21:53.855
I'm well aware, Mr. Morgan.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.191
It's not my first time at this table.

22:14.250 --> 22:18.545
Thank you, President Zhou.
President Petrov?

22:18.629 --> 22:21.257
Russia shares
China's desire for inclusion.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.135
We are looking forward
to productive talks.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.262
And we also want to extend
our sincere best wishes

22:26.345 --> 22:28.597
for President Underwood's surgery.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.183
He is dearly missed at this meeting.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.644
Thank you, Mr. President.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.023
So, shall we begin?

22:40.276 --> 22:42.569
The most pressing order of business

22:42.653 --> 22:48.367
is the joint IMF, American-Chinese
debt relief package

22:48.450 --> 22:50.411
to the Russian Federation.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.121
We're recording?

22:54.873 --> 22:58.044
Ms. Dunbar, any statement you make
will be part of the public record

22:58.127 --> 22:59.586
as part of the DOJ report.

22:59.670 --> 23:02.048
Although this video is simply
for purposes of--

23:02.131 --> 23:04.300
You can make the video
available to the media.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.467
I have nothing to hide.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.762
So you're waiving your right
to keep the video from public view?

23:08.845 --> 23:10.472
I am.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.641
The attorney general
says you pressured her

23:12.724 --> 23:14.185
to look into Lucas Goodwin's claims--

23:14.268 --> 23:16.770
I've read
the attorney general's statement.

23:16.853 --> 23:19.065
We also have a deposition
from a young woman,

23:19.148 --> 23:21.400
a staffer, who says Goodwin posed

23:21.483 --> 23:24.195
as a volunteer at an event
in Cincinnati on March 8th.

23:25.947 --> 23:27.448
Did you meet with Mr. Goodwin?

23:27.531 --> 23:30.242
I shake hundreds
of people's hands at every event.

23:30.784 --> 23:34.580
If he was in Cincinnati,
there's a chance I may have shaken his.

23:35.998 --> 23:39.043
But the claim that he and I
met one-on-one...

23:42.796 --> 23:44.340
So you're saying
you didn't meet with him?

23:44.423 --> 23:47.718
We have phone records, Ms. Dunbar.
You did speak to the attorney general.

23:47.801 --> 23:50.846
Martha is my former boss
and an old friend.

23:50.929 --> 23:53.140
We speak frequently.
Why she would claim that I--

23:53.224 --> 23:55.101
We need a simple answer,
Ms. Dunbar.

23:55.184 --> 23:59.313
Did you or did you not meet with
Lucas Goodwin privately in Cincinnati?

24:07.821 --> 24:08.947
Yes.

24:09.865 --> 24:14.161
I met with a man I didn't know
who turned out to be unhinged.

24:14.245 --> 24:16.080
I contacted the attorney general

24:16.163 --> 24:18.540
because she's the top law enforcement
official in the country

24:18.624 --> 24:22.503
and WITSEC is under her jurisdiction.
I did nothing wrong.

24:22.586 --> 24:23.837
Tell us the nature of this meeting.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.131
I'd like to say,
for the record,

24:25.214 --> 24:27.966
that I think this interview
is an act of political sabotage.

24:28.050 --> 24:31.762
Its goal is to make me
look guilty by association,

24:31.845 --> 24:35.849
but there are the way things look
and the way things actually are.

24:35.932 --> 24:39.645
When I investigated Frank Underwood,
he looked innocent, but he wasn't.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.688
I couldn't prove it,
but I knew it to be true.

24:41.772 --> 24:42.939
Ms. Dunbar--

24:43.024 --> 24:45.317
You have proof
that I met with Mr. Goodwin.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.069
I've admitted it.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.821
All that proves is that I'm honest,

24:49.905 --> 24:52.116
unlike a president who would
use the Department of Justice

24:52.199 --> 24:56.787
to target his political opponent
for his own personal gain.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.165
Let me remind you, ma'am,
the president was unconscious

24:59.248 --> 25:00.916
when this investigation began--

25:00.999 --> 25:03.335
It doesn't matter whether
he was unconscious or not,

25:03.419 --> 25:05.504
whether he lives or dies.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.923
The president is the people
who work for him.

26:13.322 --> 26:14.865
I don't think
this is going to work.

26:14.948 --> 26:19.120
Petrov's talking the talk in session,
but he won't meet with me privately.

26:19.203 --> 26:21.247
Chinese are ready to sign,
if that's the hold-up.

26:21.330 --> 26:22.789
It's not the Chinese.

26:22.873 --> 26:26.084
He refuses to meet with anyone
other than a head of state.

26:26.168 --> 26:28.587
Then see if he'll meet
with the president's wife.

26:30.631 --> 26:33.717
<i>It doesn't change the fact
that he is morally corrupt,</i>

26:33.800 --> 26:36.803
<i>and he has corrupted
the institutions that report to him.</i>

26:36.887 --> 26:41.767
<i>That is why I am running for president,
because someone needs to fight this.</i>

26:41.850 --> 26:43.602
<i>So not only did she meet with Goodwin,</i>

26:43.685 --> 26:46.272
<i>she's using the investigation
to attack a president</i>

26:46.355 --> 26:47.939
<i>who's on the operating table as we speak.</i>

26:48.023 --> 26:49.775
<i>Yeah, the way
she keeps defending herself</i>

26:49.858 --> 26:51.318
<i>only gives conspiracy theorists more...</i>

26:51.402 --> 26:52.403
She's done.

26:52.486 --> 26:53.737
<i>Now, I'm not saying
that she was involved...</i>

26:53.820 --> 26:54.863
Without a doubt.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.323
<i>...but many are
taking to social media...</i>

26:56.407 --> 26:58.450
- Seth.
<i>- Hello, Cynthia.</i>

26:58.534 --> 26:59.785
Think you might have anything for me?

26:59.868 --> 27:02.704
<i>...and certainly not a president
whose approval rating...</i>

27:02.788 --> 27:04.206
On your campaign?

27:05.123 --> 27:06.124
<i>Yeah, it's ironic...</i>

27:06.208 --> 27:08.835
<i>I'm gonna hang up now.
Good luck.</i>

27:08.919 --> 27:11.338
<i>...but I think
she may have just tanked it.</i>

27:14.550 --> 27:16.927
Mr. President...
the transplant's complete.

27:17.010 --> 27:21.682
Now they're closing him up.
We'll see how he accepts the new organ.

27:23.517 --> 27:25.644
Maybe we should try and get Claire
on the phone.

27:25.727 --> 27:26.895
Yeah.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.399
Soon. We're waiting for him now.

27:32.734 --> 27:36.071
Okay.
Okay, thank you, Donald.

27:37.239 --> 27:40.992
- So it's going well?
- Well, unless his body rejects the liver.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.458
- Mr. President.
- Mrs. Underwood.

27:47.541 --> 27:48.917
Mr. President.

27:50.919 --> 27:53.129
I thought we were meeting alone.

27:53.214 --> 27:55.757
As the administration's representative,

27:55.841 --> 27:58.385
I need to participate
in any conversations--

27:58.469 --> 28:02.097
Madam Secretary, I believe my people
were very clear, hmm?

28:03.349 --> 28:05.183
Would you give us a moment,
please, Cathy?

28:06.727 --> 28:08.520
Just a little while.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.237
I'll be outside.

28:22.576 --> 28:25.412
So... how is surgery going?

28:26.204 --> 28:27.456
So far, so good.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.959
Ah, you must be exhausted.
Now, sit. Sit.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.381
I imagine
you'd rather be at the hospital.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.090
Well, this is too important,

28:37.173 --> 28:39.843
and you weren't going to negotiate
with Secretary Durant.

28:39.926 --> 28:42.304
What makes you think
I'll negotiate with you?

28:42.388 --> 28:45.015
Oh, well, isn't that
why we're sitting here?

28:45.557 --> 28:50.646
Hmm. Maybe I just wanted to...
see your face again.

28:51.187 --> 28:52.856
Maybe I'm fond of it.

28:53.774 --> 28:57.110
You are a beautiful woman,
Mrs. Underwood, hmm?

28:57.193 --> 28:58.529
Those lips...

29:01.448 --> 29:03.742
Would you say something for me?

29:07.078 --> 29:09.122
Would you say, um...

29:10.541 --> 29:14.420
"Shame on you... Mr. President."

29:15.879 --> 29:18.840
Really, Viktor?
Are we gonna dredge that up?

29:19.966 --> 29:21.968
An apology would do...

29:22.636 --> 29:24.805
if you want to negotiate...

29:26.598 --> 29:30.060
Well, you would lose respect for me
if I apologized.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.688
Yes.

29:34.565 --> 29:36.232
Yes, this is true.

29:38.694 --> 29:41.322
I'm not here
for a sightseeing trip, Viktor.

29:42.113 --> 29:46.034
So, Francis needs a liver
and I need a bailout.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.871
- What do you need?
- I need for you to agree to the terms.

29:49.955 --> 29:53.584
Oh, yes, the terms.
The terms, yes.

29:53.667 --> 29:57.421
But why are you here...
and not with Francis?

30:00.674 --> 30:03.302
When your mother is sick,
you go to her.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.220
Not your husband, hmm?

30:07.431 --> 30:09.350
Were the stories true?

30:10.934 --> 30:13.479
Are there problems, Claire?

30:15.188 --> 30:17.774
What are your concerns with the Chinese?

30:21.069 --> 30:24.531
There are too many drilling sites
in sensitive areas.

30:24.615 --> 30:26.074
It's a security issue to us.

30:26.157 --> 30:27.951
And what sites, in particular,
are you worried about?

30:28.034 --> 30:30.787
Oh, you... you are familiar
with the individual zones?

30:30.871 --> 30:33.415
It's my plan.
I know it backwards and forwards.

30:33.499 --> 30:37.293
I see, so that's why
it's so important to you.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.046
Because it's yours.

30:44.760 --> 30:45.844
Is it one of these?

30:47.471 --> 30:49.097
On the Pacific coast?

30:59.358 --> 31:00.609
You asked for me, sir?

31:22.297 --> 31:25.091
I wanna get out of this place
as soon as possible.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.261
I'll make sure of it, sir.

31:29.971 --> 31:31.432
Where's Claire?

31:32.348 --> 31:33.809
She's in Germany.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.061
Germany?

31:37.353 --> 31:39.731
A lot to catch you up on,
Mr. President.

31:50.701 --> 31:53.078
- <i>Raymond.</i>
- The Chinese are getting skittish.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.831
<i>They wanna know
why it's taking so long.</i>

31:55.914 --> 31:58.667
Now, if Petrov doesn't agree soon,
they may back out.

31:58.750 --> 32:02.212
- Thank you, Raymond.
<i>- I'm on standby.</i>

32:03.880 --> 32:05.173
We need to shake hands on this.

32:05.256 --> 32:10.011
No. No, I told you,
nothing on Sakhalin Island.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.099
It's two zones on the southern end.
Then you have your bailout.

32:14.182 --> 32:15.851
It opens a door I don't want to open.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.604
They're being more than reasonable,
Mr. President.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.313
Reasonable?
In whose eyes?

32:20.396 --> 32:22.524
You and China are raping Siberia.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.943
We didn't run your economy
into the ground.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.402
You did.

32:26.487 --> 32:30.073
Is this how you tried to convince
Michael Corrigan before he hung himself?

32:30.156 --> 32:31.867
Because that's what
you are asking me to do,

32:31.950 --> 32:33.910
to tie the noose around my own neck.

32:34.995 --> 32:37.998
What's next?
The Black Sea? The Arctic?

32:38.081 --> 32:42.919
I cannot allow the Chinese ships
to come this close to my sovereign--

32:45.589 --> 32:48.884
Mrs. Underwood,
President Underwood is on the line.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.137
- He's awake?
- Yes, ma'am.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.306
Go, go.
We're done here.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.607
- I can't speak with him right now.
- Mrs. Underwood--

33:03.690 --> 33:05.358
I will let you know when I'm available.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.443
Yes, ma'am.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.823
You should talk to your husband.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.451
I'm not leaving here
until we have an agreement.

33:15.536 --> 33:17.287
But you're an amateur, Claire.

33:17.370 --> 33:21.583
You fly in, you puff up your chest
and you pretend to play president.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.210
But what would you be
without your husband?

33:24.294 --> 33:26.505
Nothing.
A pretty face.

33:27.839 --> 33:32.803
So, yes,
play the president if you like.

33:32.886 --> 33:37.182
Go. Tell the Chinese
they get nothing on the Pacific.

33:38.099 --> 33:41.978
You think you can do that,
Mrs. Underwood?

33:43.689 --> 33:45.982
Your people are hurting.

33:46.066 --> 33:49.069
Six months at most,
they're gonna be marching on Red Square.

33:50.236 --> 33:53.239
I'm done letting you have your dignity.

33:53.323 --> 33:56.284
The truth is you're a beggar
on your knees,

33:56.367 --> 34:00.163
and you will take
whatever we shove down your throat.

34:08.463 --> 34:09.464
Viktor.

34:14.219 --> 34:17.556
Take the deal.
Get your dignity back.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.487
Madam Secretary.

34:41.913 --> 34:45.125
Joint control of zones 61 and 67.

34:46.710 --> 34:49.920
We've got an agreement,
pending the president's approval.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.716
Well, he's sleeping now.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.136
They're moving him back
to the White House soon.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.347
- And how did he seem?
<i>- I only talked to him briefly,</i>

34:59.430 --> 35:03.977
<i>but the doctors say the organ is...
taking well so far.</i>

35:04.060 --> 35:05.896
They're expecting a quick recovery.

35:08.899 --> 35:11.151
You've done an outstanding job,
Mr. President.

35:12.068 --> 35:15.571
- So have you, Claire.
- I'm going to try and get some rest.

35:15.656 --> 35:18.784
<i>Of course.
Have a safe flight.</i>

35:26.875 --> 35:29.210
<i>Experts were pessimistic
that anything meaningful</i>

35:29.294 --> 35:31.212
<i>could come out of the summit.</i>

35:31.296 --> 35:33.298
Draft of the appropriations bill
from the Speaker's office.

35:33.381 --> 35:34.841
Just put it on the desk, please.

35:34.925 --> 35:37.177
<i>...Catherine Durant
had this to say from Brandenburg.</i>

35:37.260 --> 35:39.095
<i>President Petrov and I
worked through the night</i>

35:39.179 --> 35:43.684
<i>in concert with the Chinese government
in order to come up with an agreement.</i>

35:43.767 --> 35:46.519
<i>Along with partners
in the private sector,</i>

35:46.602 --> 35:50.190
<i>the United States, China, and Russia
will collaborate on a plan</i>

35:50.273 --> 35:55.445
<i>to extract oil from untapped sites
in eastern Siberia.</i>

35:55.528 --> 35:59.615
<i>This will then enable a return
to a more stable oil market,</i>

35:59.700 --> 36:03.203
<i>as well as a stable global economy.</i>

36:03.286 --> 36:05.872
<i>Now, in order to make this plan viable</i>

36:05.956 --> 36:07.833
<i>and mitigate any tax burden...</i>

36:07.916 --> 36:10.501
<i>...to the American
and Chinese taxpayers,</i>

36:10.585 --> 36:14.505
<i>the corporations will provide
the bulk of the investment,</i>

36:14.589 --> 36:19.469
<i>the, uh, infrastructure
to extract the oil and the technology.</i>

36:19.552 --> 36:21.429
<i>And then any of the profits</i>

36:21.512 --> 36:26.226
<i>will then be distributed commensurately
among these corporations, as well,</i>

36:26.309 --> 36:28.812
<i>and including
the land value invested</i>

36:28.895 --> 36:30.897
<i>by the Russian government.</i>

36:31.857 --> 36:33.399
<i>So at this time,
I'd like to open the floor</i>

36:33.483 --> 36:34.818
<i>to any questions.</i>

37:55.816 --> 37:58.651
I'm getting a lot of questions
about the First Lady's involvement.

37:58.734 --> 38:01.362
We stick to our message
that she was just there to assist.

38:01.446 --> 38:02.823
Secretary Durant led the effort.

38:02.906 --> 38:05.533
There's multiple reports
that she and Petrov had a long meeting.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.786
They greeted each other.
That's it.

38:07.869 --> 38:09.454
So we deny?

38:09.537 --> 38:11.414
The president
hasn't approved the plan yet.

38:11.497 --> 38:14.167
We wanna focus on his recovery, not the--

38:15.877 --> 38:19.047
- Yes?
<i>- Secretary of Health for you, sir.</i>

38:20.924 --> 38:22.050
I'll find you in your office.

38:31.852 --> 38:32.853
Madam Secretary.

38:33.353 --> 38:36.064
- I just sent you an email.
<i>- Hold on.</i>

38:42.320 --> 38:43.696
What is this?

38:43.779 --> 38:47.158
<i>The father you see there?
That's who we bumped for the president.</i>

38:47.242 --> 38:51.121
<i>He died an hour ago.
Father of two, loving husband.</i>

38:51.204 --> 38:54.290
Delete it right now
from your outbox.

38:54.374 --> 38:57.168
<i>I already did,
but I wanted you to see his face...</i>

38:57.752 --> 39:00.046
the family he left behind.

39:44.382 --> 39:48.219
Well, uh, it will probably
take a few days, but, uh, I'm--

39:49.429 --> 39:51.639
My wife is up.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.391
Thank you, gentlemen.

39:56.686 --> 39:59.647
- Mrs. Underwood.
- Mrs. Underwood.

39:59.730 --> 40:00.982
Claire.

40:27.133 --> 40:28.634
Are you in a lot of pain?

40:29.552 --> 40:31.137
Nothing I can't handle.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.145
Meechum?

40:41.731 --> 40:43.149
I spoke to his mother.

40:49.405 --> 40:51.241
- Francis, don't--
- Help me up.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.454
Are you sure?

40:57.372 --> 40:59.790
Yes. It's good for the recovery.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.043
Doctor's orders.

41:05.671 --> 41:08.549
They want me on my feet
at least once a day.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.142
Let's take a walk.

41:21.812 --> 41:24.983
Now, let me see if I can do it.

41:58.266 --> 42:00.101
I need a minute.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.802
I'm going to approve your plan.

42:39.724 --> 42:41.142
It's a good plan.

42:42.602 --> 42:44.104
It was hard.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.357
Harder than I thought it would be.

42:54.155 --> 42:55.490
Stay with me.

42:58.033 --> 43:01.036
It's us against them.
Always.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.956
Otherwise, what's the goddamn point?

43:06.834 --> 43:09.920
I can't do it, Francis.
I can't come back and be First Lady.

43:10.004 --> 43:11.547
Not that.

43:15.301 --> 43:17.220
Not that.

43:26.020 --> 43:29.940
I said you were nothing,
in the Oval, without me.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.569
It's the other way around.

43:38.408 --> 43:40.410
It would have to be different.

43:42.953 --> 43:44.247
I know.

43:46.666 --> 43:48.501
That's what I'm saying.

43:56.342 --> 43:59.011
Come on. Let's see if you can make it
to the end of the hall.
