WEBVTT

00:21.021 --> 00:23.982
[Marty] Okay, our partner thinks
that she's a good hire,

00:24.065 --> 00:26.151
-and you weren't at that meeting.
-No, I was at the casino

00:26.234 --> 00:27.193
covering your ass.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.362
Well, I wasn't exactly on vacation.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.698
-No, I know that.
-I was under a great deal of pressure.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.534
Yeah, but you made
a huge unilateral decision.

00:36.119 --> 00:40.165
[Sue] Wendy, did why do you feel
so resistant to hiring,

00:40.248 --> 00:42.167
-um... Maya?
-Maya. Maya. Maya.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.962
This isn't about her resume, is it?

00:46.671 --> 00:48.339
It's personal for you.

00:48.423 --> 00:51.843
No, no, no. No, not at all. I just...

00:53.636 --> 00:57.182
I just think that it is a <i>huge</i> risk

00:57.432 --> 01:01.728
to put somebody with such radically
different viewpoints from ours

01:01.811 --> 01:05.023
in a position of power in our life.
Like, I understand...

01:06.066 --> 01:09.027
I understand you are under
a lot of pressure, and I am...

01:09.736 --> 01:12.238
I'm so sorry you went through that,

01:12.655 --> 01:16.117
but Maya is not the answer
to any of our problems.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.203
Fine. Our partner thinks that she is.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.621
Yeah, well, I disagree.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.415
[Sue] Good. Good communication.

01:23.124 --> 01:26.586
Can you access some feeling words?

01:28.838 --> 01:30.340
I'm scared!

01:31.841 --> 01:34.094
I'm fucking terrified, actually.

01:34.302 --> 01:38.098
-[Sue] Ooh, those are strong feelings.
-Let me tell you why you're scared, Wendy.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.766
You don't believe in your husband.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.644
-Yet, I have kept us safe this entire--
-"Safe"?

01:42.727 --> 01:45.146
For some reason, you think that
you're somehow incapable--

01:45.230 --> 01:47.816
-You think we're safe?
-I do think that we're safe.

01:47.899 --> 01:48.733
[Wendy] Ha!

01:49.651 --> 01:51.694
-Gonna help me out here, Sue?
-Yeah! That'd be great.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.656
Can you explain to her that
everything that I do is for the family?

01:54.739 --> 01:57.867
Oh, and can you explain to him
that <i>that</i> is complete bullshit?

01:58.660 --> 02:02.455
I think that the two of you
are doing a terrific job

02:02.539 --> 02:03.957
at talking this out.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.001
Really? 'Cause I feel like
we're going in circles.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.338
So, please... weigh in.

02:10.421 --> 02:11.673
You gotta have something to say.

02:15.343 --> 02:18.096
I do, actually.

02:20.098 --> 02:23.017
What does it say about a marriage

02:23.434 --> 02:29.190
when a husband and wife
both try to bribe the therapist?

02:32.026 --> 02:34.487
You're both paying me off.

02:35.738 --> 02:38.199
There. I said it.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.332
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-Fuck's wrong with you?

02:46.416 --> 02:48.168
-You did the same goddamn thing I did.
-Once!

02:48.251 --> 02:49.502
-Once!
-You're a fucking beauty.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.130
Because I was worried when you came back
with that crazy idea,

02:52.255 --> 02:54.883
and I wanted Sue to work a little harder.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.135
You people don't make it easy for anybody.

02:57.218 --> 02:58.553
Just shut the fuck up, Sue.

02:58.636 --> 03:01.014
No, wait.
Have you been doing this the entire time?

03:01.097 --> 03:02.765
Are you that insecure?

03:02.849 --> 03:06.394
No, I'm that ignored, Wendy.
You wanna know why I'm bribing this woman?

03:06.477 --> 03:08.563
It's because you're completely incapable
of listening.

03:08.646 --> 03:10.148
This is my only chance
to convince you

03:10.231 --> 03:12.483
that what you are doing
is putting us in danger.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.360
First, you force us to stay here.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.030
Second, you dig us in so deep,
we're never going to get out.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.657
And now I discover that you've been
pouring your heart out

03:19.741 --> 03:22.118
on the phone every night to Navarro,

03:22.202 --> 03:24.579
interpreting his fucking omens.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.372
What is wrong with you?

03:26.456 --> 03:28.666
-You get how dangerous that is?
-You're listening to my calls.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.418
Wanna know what happened
to the maid that lost the teeth?

03:30.501 --> 03:31.711
-You're jealous.
-He killed her.

03:31.794 --> 03:34.380
You're jealous, that's what this is about.
You can't keep up with me.

03:34.464 --> 03:38.134
-Give me a fucking break.
-No, you can't. You can't keep up with me.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.846
And I have one sliver of success,
and you, you lose your mind.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.057
"Success." Chopping the balls off a horse.
Is that success?

03:44.140 --> 03:45.642
-Come on! I didn't know.
-[Marty] Exactly.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.477
Your ambition makes you reckless.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.938
You go into business with a drug lord,

03:50.021 --> 03:51.856
what did you think was gonna happen?

03:51.940 --> 03:53.524
-My ambition?
-Yeah.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.444
You're so arrogant,
you think you can flip an FBI agent.

03:56.527 --> 03:58.571
Do you know how crazy that sounds?

03:58.655 --> 04:00.406
Is it crazier than killing someone?

04:02.325 --> 04:03.493
Don't you dare.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.246
Don't you-- I didn't kill Cade.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.289
No, you had somebody else do it for you.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.416
For our family.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.626
And I stayed with you.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.670
Oh, wow!

04:13.753 --> 04:16.923
Well, does that make you
a big fucking hero?

04:17.465 --> 04:20.802
I only did what I did because you didn't
have the balls to do it yourself.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.929
No, I was busy trying
to get us the fuck out.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.555
-They would've found us.
-No, they wouldn't.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.683
We'd be dead by now if you'd got your way.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.435
You'd say anything
to justify what you did.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.562
I don't know how you live with yourself.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.108
You're an ungrateful prick.

04:35.191 --> 04:38.194
You did exactly what you wanted to do,
and you always have, haven't you?

04:38.278 --> 04:39.112
That is not true.

04:39.195 --> 04:42.240
Gary, Navarro, another casino,
a horse farm.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.367
You put everything before the family.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.368
I am trying.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.997
I am trying to build a future
for our family

04:49.080 --> 04:51.582
out of the mess that you created.

04:51.666 --> 04:55.420
[stammers] And you're too narrow-minded
and jealous to see it.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.714
Right, yeah,
and you're just a fucking scary,

04:57.797 --> 05:00.675
selfish, power-hungry fucking bitch.

05:06.472 --> 05:09.183
Great. Get the fuck out. Do it.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.269
-I don't need you.
-[door opens]

05:11.352 --> 05:14.022
-I don't even fucking know you anymore.
-[door shuts]

05:18.026 --> 05:19.110
[sighs]

05:26.826 --> 05:28.828
[theme music playing]

05:35.626 --> 05:38.671
[Marty] Obviously, we need to discuss
doctor-patient confidentiality.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.259
I mean, I don't have to tell you.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.262
Breathe even a word of this to someone,
it's got some...

05:47.055 --> 05:49.557
pretty nasty implications for your career.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.602
And for you and Wendy, I imagine.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.521
[Marty] Hmm.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.525
How much money do you want?

06:00.443 --> 06:02.278
It's not about money, Marty.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.446
How much?

06:07.825 --> 06:09.202
A shitload.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.329
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's what I thought.

06:23.633 --> 06:24.926
Get in the car, Wendy.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.516
You're gonna walk home?

06:32.517 --> 06:36.104
Home is a 43-minute walk from here.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.940
By the time I get there, I want you out.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.580
[Sam] Thanks.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.334
What's with all the federal agents?

06:58.418 --> 07:01.254
All good, Sam. Casinos are regulated.

07:01.337 --> 07:02.505
Regulated how?

07:02.797 --> 07:04.549
Just... regulated.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.676
What are they regulating?

07:06.759 --> 07:09.804
[sighs]
They're called compliance officers.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.472
All normal.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.850
Just don't look like
you're trying to lose.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.685
Look like you're having fun.

07:18.604 --> 07:21.482
-[Sam sighs]
-Fuckin' smile.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.364
[gamblers cheering]

07:28.448 --> 07:30.074
Hey, you know what this is?

07:31.033 --> 07:33.077
I could not care less what it is.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.456
It's a bill from my body shop for $7,800!

07:36.622 --> 07:37.874
For bird shit?

07:38.875 --> 07:41.085
For a custom paint job on my Trans Am.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.545
A little steep, don't you think?

07:42.628 --> 07:45.047
Considering the car is not worth
hardly half of that.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.133
Well, that's what it's gonna cost you.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.136
You and me are even.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.472
Call the Audubon Society or some shit.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.099
Better yet, the casino gives loans now.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.059
I can get you an application.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.813
Hey, this whole anti-authority thing
you got going on,

08:00.938 --> 08:02.440
it's gonna get you hurt.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.696
You're fucking touching me.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.250
I'm making some changes
with tomorrow's drop.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.877
I already talked to my boys.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.254
The abandoned stadium
off of Woodrow Wilson.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.672
-It's quiet.
-No.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.050
The drive-in in Branch. Got it?

08:29.175 --> 08:31.969
What the fuck is your problem?
That stadium is a good drop.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.638
No, the last time you picked,

08:33.721 --> 08:35.306
your crew tried to fuck with me

08:35.389 --> 08:38.226
and jeopardized a shit-ton of money, so...

08:43.564 --> 08:45.650
And you ain't a fucking authority!

09:03.918 --> 09:05.253
You heard from Omar?

09:06.337 --> 09:08.381
If you're wondering
if he's still angry with you,

09:08.464 --> 09:09.966
yes, he's still angry.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.260
Next time I give you advice, listen to it.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.723
-Mmm.
-I know. We need a new machine.

09:21.727 --> 09:25.064
I should probably let you know,
Marty and I are taking some time apart.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.570
Why?

09:33.155 --> 09:34.365
We had a fight.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.784
-What kind of a fight?
-A big one.

09:37.451 --> 09:39.078
You're not splitting up, I hope.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.497
No. No, I don't know.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.835
He was being a dick, so I tossed him out.

09:46.752 --> 09:47.795
You know how it goes.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.089
I do.

09:51.048 --> 09:54.302
I also know to never underestimate
the power of somebody moving out,

09:54.427 --> 09:55.511
however briefly.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.430
Well, we're still business partners.

09:57.513 --> 10:00.308
Everything will function exactly
as it has before.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.351
I just don't have to deal with his shit
right now.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.604
You say that, but the first time you--
[sighs]

10:04.687 --> 10:06.355
Jesus Christ. The fuck is she doing here?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.487
I want to talk to your boss, alone.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.032
Where's Zeke?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.326
-With my lover.
-Oh, right.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.119
It's summer vacation.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.204
Don't you worry about Zeke.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.499
He is safe and sound
and none of your business.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.209
Judge told you that.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.130
What do you want, Darlene?

10:31.547 --> 10:34.967
I've re-planted my crop.
We're back in business.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.094
I came about our distribution deal.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.888
Are you out of your mind?

10:38.971 --> 10:41.724
You can't plant poppies
that close to the casino.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.643
This is my land.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.936
We'll be up and running in four months.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.689
You killed 57 people

10:48.773 --> 10:50.358
when you spiked our dope.

10:50.441 --> 10:51.651
Junkies.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.987
That is dirty water under an old bridge.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.282
I don't care. Your deal went away
the second that you crossed the cartel.

11:00.451 --> 11:01.952
[Darlene] You burned our fields.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.623
You took our land
for this monstrosity of a casino.

11:05.706 --> 11:06.916
Whose profits you enjoy.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.043
And now you're going back on your word?

11:09.126 --> 11:11.837
You made a commitment. You owe us.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.840
The last thing that we promised you
was to spare your life.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.885
Don't make us go back on that one.
Now get the fuck out of my office.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.263
Broken promises got consequences.

11:21.764 --> 11:22.848
Bring 'em on.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.203
[Marty] <i>You had a guy killed, Wendy.</i>

11:44.286 --> 11:46.372
Does that weigh on your conscience at all?

11:46.455 --> 11:47.707
'Cause I don't see it.

11:47.790 --> 11:51.335
And now I'm-- I'm weak,
because I've got a soul.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.461
That's rich.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.879
You're so...

11:53.963 --> 11:57.967
so calm, so cold after Mason's death.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.885
Like it never fucking happened.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.220
Well, we could have gotten out.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.514
It all would have worked,
but you didn't want that.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.599
I saved us,
you pulled us right back into the shit.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.059
Now I gotta save us all over again.

12:07.143 --> 12:10.104
And I'm fucking arrogant?
Are you fucking kidding me?

12:10.187 --> 12:12.273
I'm doing exactly what you wanted.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.108
You wanted me to step up,
I'm stepping up,

12:14.233 --> 12:16.777
and you cannot even back
that one goddamn play.

12:16.861 --> 12:20.239
You think I'm gonna apologize
for protecting my family?

12:20.322 --> 12:21.449
You're out of your mind.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.493
You're out of your fucking mind.

12:40.718 --> 12:41.594
Hi.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.096
Hey. How are you doing?

12:44.722 --> 12:48.350
Uh, not great, actually.
Wendy and I had a fight, if you must know.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.394
Sorry, that sucks.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.855
Yeah, I was thinking that, um,

12:52.938 --> 12:56.650
I might go check out that place
that they put you up in. Do you like it?

12:57.067 --> 12:58.527
Yeah, it's great.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.780
As long as you don't care
about aesthetics.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.657
Or comfort or hygiene.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.452
Uh, it's got a roof though, right?

13:08.037 --> 13:08.913
[Maya] Hmm.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.170
-What's this?
-It's a confession.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.339
All you gotta do is sign.

13:18.422 --> 13:22.134
Oh, yeah. I gotta--
I gotta check with Wendy first. Okay?

13:22.927 --> 13:24.595
[Maya] Is this what you're fighting over?

13:25.429 --> 13:28.390
It is part of it, uh, you know.
She'll get there.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.519
-I just need a little bit of time.
-You know what this looks like, right?

13:31.602 --> 13:35.064
It looks like I'm stalling, but I'm not.
I just moved out of the house, so...

13:36.774 --> 13:39.318
Look, I went out on a limb
to get you this deal.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.613
Just look at it.
Cross out anything you don't like.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.865
[stammers] Can I be honest with you?

13:44.949 --> 13:46.116
I don't know yet.

13:46.742 --> 13:49.203
Uh, I don't-- I don't trust you.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.121
Okay.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.542
You know, there's a big risk for me,
and you can dress it up as safe,

13:54.625 --> 13:56.544
but we both know it's not that simple.

13:56.794 --> 14:00.089
-And everything I know about the FBI--
-You haven't had good agents on your case.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.633
Well, are there any? You know, I mean...

14:03.968 --> 14:06.011
Evans is out for blood, and...

14:07.221 --> 14:08.514
Petty was a sociopath.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.475
You know, he, um,
he got one of my people hooked on drugs.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.770
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
Look, I will deny ever saying it.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.898
Agent Petty, dick. Agent Evans, dick.

14:18.315 --> 14:19.525
Shouldn't even be on your case.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.027
Especially not when
the two of them were sleeping together.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.737
Completely unprofessional.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.115
But I'm not them.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.993
But how do I know that? You know?

14:29.326 --> 14:30.369
I don't know that.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.289
You know, this is--
this is a two-way street,

14:33.372 --> 14:35.791
and I tried to prove to you that

14:36.125 --> 14:37.793
I want to do the right thing,

14:37.877 --> 14:39.879
that you can trust me,
and you turned me down.

14:39.962 --> 14:43.257
And so now you gotta prove to me
that I can trust you,

14:43.340 --> 14:45.467
and until I do,
and until Wendy's on board,

14:45.551 --> 14:48.095
I cannot sign anything. I'm sorry.

14:48.178 --> 14:52.600
You know, I mean, I want to work with you,
but not at any cost, so...

15:01.317 --> 15:04.361
[Darlene] <i>You ever notice people</i>
<i>don't honor their word anymore?</i>

15:04.445 --> 15:07.740
Well, I've done everything I can do
for you and baby Zeke, Darlene.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.491
Not talking about you.

15:10.034 --> 15:14.371
The cartel's breaking their agreement
to distribute my product.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.749
Can you believe that? The nerve.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.710
Well, I don't know
what I can do about that.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.129
I can't arrest people
for not doing crime.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.925
How many people you got working under you?

15:26.634 --> 15:28.344
Ten. Count the reserves.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.305
How many you trust?

15:31.931 --> 15:34.767
Your kind of business? Three, four.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.020
That'll do, for a start.

15:38.395 --> 15:39.688
We can always recruit.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.899
People around here trust the police.

15:43.525 --> 15:45.945
[sighs] Darlene, no.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.614
No, come on.
There's limits to what I can do.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.741
Who sets those limits? Not you.

15:50.824 --> 15:54.453
[sighs]
Darlene, I cannot be slinging dope.

15:54.536 --> 15:55.704
Are you kidding me?

15:56.330 --> 15:58.165
How am I even supposed to ask 'em?

15:58.332 --> 16:00.668
You can stand there and refuse me

16:01.168 --> 16:02.920
after all I've done for you?

16:03.420 --> 16:05.589
Jacob's still warm in his grave,

16:05.673 --> 16:08.217
-and you want to cross me now?
-No.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.016
I'm gonna need some time.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.103
Get 'em primed.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.354
Figure it out.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.022
You got three months.

16:23.107 --> 16:26.318
And whatever arrangements you have
with the Byrde family...

16:27.152 --> 16:28.445
that's over.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.823
No more protecting them.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.075
-You got me?
-[door opens]

16:34.034 --> 16:35.035
[door closes]

16:37.246 --> 16:38.080
[sighs]

16:53.637 --> 16:55.764
I thought I told you
to stay away from Erin.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.641
Hmm. She called me.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.394
Well, then don't pick up.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.442
This is a bad idea.

17:06.525 --> 17:10.195
Uh, A of all, he brought us beer.
B of all, it's summer,

17:10.279 --> 17:12.406
and C of all, you're not my mom.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.576
He's not a nice guy, Erin.

17:15.659 --> 17:16.785
[Erin] He's nice to me.

17:20.456 --> 17:23.208
[rock music playing]

17:23.792 --> 17:24.835
[Erin] Mm-hmm.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.671
-[Tommy] Okay, iron lung.
-[Erin laughs]

17:36.138 --> 17:37.681
[Tommy] Wait, did you even inhale it?

17:37.806 --> 17:39.308
[Erin scoffs] Come on, Jonah.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.935
-[Tommy] It's good weed. Inhale it.
-[Erin laughs]

17:43.729 --> 17:46.148
[inhales]

17:46.231 --> 17:49.276
-[coughing]
-[laughing]

17:50.486 --> 17:53.197
-[Erin] Are you kidding?
-Would you cut it out? He's 14.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.365
Come on. You're having fun, right, buddy?

17:55.449 --> 17:57.618
Does anyone wanna play
a drinking game called "Suck It"?

17:57.701 --> 17:58.702
No!

17:59.161 --> 18:01.538
-Actually... I got a better idea.
-[Erin laughs]

18:16.637 --> 18:17.888
[Erin] Come on, Charlotte.

18:22.142 --> 18:22.976
[Charlotte gasps]

18:24.978 --> 18:25.813
[Tommy chuckles]

18:27.064 --> 18:30.109
Wanna hold it? It's safe, I promise.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.194
We should go.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.154
Uh, I'm not ready to go.

18:34.863 --> 18:37.866
Yo, if you want,
I can just ride with Tommy.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.662
[Tommy]
Hmm. Thirty-ish feet right here, right?

18:43.247 --> 18:45.499
Hey, mind pointing that down, dude?

18:45.666 --> 18:48.794
Why? Think I'm gonna shoot you?
Who'd load my fucking truck?

18:48.877 --> 18:51.672
Oh, Jesus. Come on, Erin.
This is fucking crazy.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.216
Let's go, Erin.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.843
"Let's go, Erin."

18:56.552 --> 18:58.011
God, you're such a pussy.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.431
-Does anybody hear a pussy talking?
-Screw you.

19:01.515 --> 19:04.351
Oh, my God. Pussy stood up to me.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.478
Can you shoot a gun, pussy?

19:06.603 --> 19:07.855
-Wanna try?
-[Jonah] Yeah.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.189
Don't.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.191
Let him.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.110
[Jonah] Okay.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.991
You get three shots. You hit one bottle,
I'll give you 20 bucks.

19:20.742 --> 19:21.952
If I hit all three?

19:23.245 --> 19:24.538
That's a nine millimeter, kid.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.206
It kicks.

19:35.632 --> 19:36.550
Okay.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.385
My turn.

19:40.929 --> 19:42.139
-God!
-[boy] Jesus.

19:42.222 --> 19:44.266
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

19:44.349 --> 19:45.893
Calm down, okay? I was--

19:46.602 --> 19:48.562
-[Charlotte sighs]
-Okay.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.564
Put it on your head.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.483
No! You put the fucking gun down!

19:53.567 --> 19:55.527
-[Tommy] Do it.
-No! Jonah!

19:55.611 --> 19:56.570
[Tommy] Could be fun.

19:58.071 --> 19:58.989
Come on.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.325
-Try it.
-No!

20:01.408 --> 20:03.577
-[sirens wailing]
-Fuck!

20:03.660 --> 20:06.038
[man] Drop your firearm. Hands in the air!

20:10.250 --> 20:12.377
[man speaking indistinctly
over police radio]

20:19.343 --> 20:21.511
We know anything more? [sighs]

20:21.595 --> 20:22.679
[Wendy] Mnh-mnh.

20:23.764 --> 20:24.640
[Marty sighs]

20:32.522 --> 20:33.899
Where are you staying?

20:34.983 --> 20:37.778
Uh, at the Howling Creek,
where Maya's living.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.073
[laughs] Perfect.

20:44.826 --> 20:46.745
[Charlotte]
I'm sorry. I thought I had it handled.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.705
Well, you didn't, did you?

20:57.464 --> 20:58.882
[Wendy] Were you drinking, too?

20:58.966 --> 21:00.300
[Jonah] No, I wouldn't.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.970
[Wendy] Oh, good. So it was just
the pot and the guns, then.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.805
Charlotte, I've got a question.

21:04.888 --> 21:07.015
Why didn't you leave? You had a van.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.809
Erin wouldn't leave.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.436
-Okay, you can't make your own--
-Wendy, a word.

21:12.062 --> 21:13.105
Okay.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.399
In my car. Now.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.276
Can I ride with you, Dad?

21:17.651 --> 21:20.195
Oh, uh, you should go
in your mom's car. Okay?

21:20.279 --> 21:21.113
Why?

21:21.196 --> 21:22.948
It's okay. We're just-- we're...

21:23.198 --> 21:24.283
-We're...
-Having a...

21:24.366 --> 21:25.701
-A thing. Here we go.
-...thing.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.244
What kind of thing?

21:27.327 --> 21:28.829
[Wendy] In my car. Now.

21:32.582 --> 21:34.960
All I asked was for your kids
to show her around.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.670
Charlotte tried to keep Erin
away from that boy,

21:36.753 --> 21:39.214
but she couldn't exactly explain why now,
could she?

21:39.339 --> 21:41.883
-Oh, I see. So this is my fault.
-I'm not saying that.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.177
She has never been in any trouble before.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.889
The first thing Erin said to Charlotte
when she got here

21:47.973 --> 21:51.184
was that she wanted lose her virginity
and could Charlotte help.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.356
So she drove her to the middle of nowhere
with some low-level mobsters?

21:56.440 --> 21:57.441
That's nice work.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.067
If Charlotte hadn't stayed with Erin,

21:59.151 --> 22:01.069
God only knows
what would have happened to her.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.656
Look, we are all upset here--

22:04.740 --> 22:07.492
You know something? We may have
dipped our toe in the friendship pool,

22:07.576 --> 22:10.537
-but I'm not sure we're gonna swim.
-Oh, fine with me.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.832
[Evans] <i>What the hell happened out there?</i>

22:13.915 --> 22:16.793
-[Tommy] <i>I got them loosened up.</i>
-[Evans] <i>No, you got them arrested.</i>

22:17.169 --> 22:19.504
-Look, I'm working the lawyer's kid.
-Yeah?

22:20.630 --> 22:23.633
Yeah,<i> </i>and I'd say
I'm doing pretty damn good.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.553
Okay? She can't stand the Byrde kids.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.096
She hates her mom.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.391
-And she loves me.
-Are you sure about that?

22:33.226 --> 22:35.062
Today she told me she's a virgin.

22:35.645 --> 22:37.814
So, what do you think?

22:40.984 --> 22:42.361
Just don't knock her up.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.993
[Ruth] He's sorely fucking mistaken

22:50.077 --> 22:53.497
if he thinks that I'm gonna pay
for that piece of shit car of his.

22:56.750 --> 23:00.003
[sighs] I shouldn't have messed with him.
I didn't realize.

23:00.670 --> 23:03.048
No, fuck that. It was funny.

23:03.507 --> 23:06.009
[laughs] He's a piece of shit anyway.

23:08.095 --> 23:11.598
Maybe, but you gotta be careful
with guys like that.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.352
No, he can't touch me.

23:16.436 --> 23:19.272
I'm like a made woman over there.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.653
If his boys try any shit tomorrow,
I swear to God--

23:24.736 --> 23:26.113
No, stop it.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.032
Don't worry so much.

23:30.826 --> 23:31.868
I can handle it.

23:59.187 --> 24:01.690
[panting]

24:30.218 --> 24:31.344
Are you okay?

24:32.846 --> 24:34.014
It's not you.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.518
-[Ben exhales]
-Um...

24:39.769 --> 24:42.439
I'm the only girl here. [sighs]

24:42.564 --> 24:45.525
[exhales] I just drank too much.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.360
That's all.

24:48.778 --> 24:50.280
[Ben groans]

24:50.947 --> 24:52.574
You are so fucking beautiful.

24:56.620 --> 24:57.662
Yeah, okay.

25:03.126 --> 25:04.002
I'm sorry.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.811
You know, someday...

25:23.230 --> 25:25.607
you're gonna meet a girl who's so dope

25:26.191 --> 25:28.652
that you won't need to shoot a gun
to impress her.

25:36.117 --> 25:38.036
You think Dad's moving out for good?

25:39.704 --> 25:40.747
I don't know.

25:41.248 --> 25:43.333
Let's just try to get some sleep, okay?

26:46.730 --> 26:48.898
Hey, Maya, good morning.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.610
Let me give you a hand with that.
It looks heavy.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.653
Thanks. Dryer's busted.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.072
[Marty chuckles]
I don't know what you expect.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.408
[Maya] Hmm. You got a suite.

26:59.409 --> 27:01.703
[Marty]
Yeah, well, that's what they call it.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.747
[Maya chuckles] You should try the buffet.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.875
Looks like they washed the food
a couple times to keep it fresh.

27:06.958 --> 27:07.792
[Marty chuckles]

27:09.628 --> 27:10.920
Did you forget something?

27:12.881 --> 27:16.426
Nobody tells you you're gonna be sick

42:31.549 --> 42:33.300
<i>I just checked. It's not us.</i>

42:35.970 --> 42:37.680
Then who the fuck is it then?

42:38.138 --> 42:39.932
<i>I don't know, but it's not us.</i>

42:40.349 --> 42:41.642
<i>Where are you exactly?</i>

42:42.601 --> 42:45.688
Uh, I'm out in front of a dollar store,

42:45.771 --> 42:49.316
in a mini-mall,
corner of Hawk Nest and Parkway.

42:49.400 --> 42:50.651
<i>Is there a back door?</i>

42:51.652 --> 42:54.738
Um, there's an alleyway,
so there must be.

42:54.989 --> 42:58.450
<i>Go inside. In five minutes,</i>
<i>Nelson will pick you up and take you home.</i>

43:02.121 --> 43:06.250
[Marty over phone] <i>Uh, okay,</i>
<i>but right now, I'm not living at home.</i>

43:08.627 --> 43:11.505
-[Helen] <i>You are tonight.</i>
-[knock on door]

43:20.431 --> 43:21.599
Is Ben here?

43:25.436 --> 43:26.645
He's downstairs.

43:44.913 --> 43:48.083
[Ruth panting]
I don't care if we can't fuck.

43:48.167 --> 43:50.002
I just want to talk, okay?

43:50.377 --> 43:51.295
Okay.

43:51.378 --> 43:53.380
[soft music plays over radio]

43:56.133 --> 43:57.259
What's going on?

44:03.349 --> 44:04.808
I saw Wyatt today.

44:06.518 --> 44:07.978
Up at the Snell place.

44:10.439 --> 44:11.607
What happened?

44:23.535 --> 44:25.371
I ruined his fucking life.

44:26.246 --> 44:27.206
Hey.

44:28.123 --> 44:30.000
Hey, no, you didn't.

44:31.752 --> 44:34.171
What? How?

44:36.256 --> 44:38.300
[breath trembling] I just...

44:40.219 --> 44:41.470
I just, I...

44:41.679 --> 44:44.014
I-- I-- I fucked it all up.

44:45.599 --> 44:48.185
[sobbing] I-- I might--

44:48.268 --> 44:51.397
I might as well have put him
in that psycho's bed.

44:52.606 --> 44:54.525
Shh. Come here.

44:55.192 --> 44:57.194
Shh.

45:01.657 --> 45:03.659
[sniffling]

45:37.818 --> 45:39.153
[racks round]

45:44.491 --> 45:45.909
What are you doing here?

45:47.035 --> 45:48.203
Helen didn't call?

45:48.954 --> 45:51.290
-No.
-That's great. I'm being followed.

45:52.708 --> 45:53.834
Who's following you?

45:53.917 --> 45:55.836
I don't know,
but I gotta spend the night here.

45:57.045 --> 45:59.673
Well... I'll leave, then.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.759
You can't. Helen's orders.

46:02.384 --> 46:04.803
Wendy, I don't want this
any more than you do.

46:05.012 --> 46:05.929
[Jonah] Dad?

46:07.055 --> 46:08.432
-[Marty] Nobody leaves.
-[Charlotte] Why?

46:12.519 --> 46:14.688
-Can we be in our rooms?
-No.

46:14.772 --> 46:17.399
-No, I want you where I can see you.
-[Charlotte sighs]

46:39.755 --> 46:41.632
Now do you believe it wasn't you?

46:42.883 --> 46:45.511
Shut up. [laughs]

46:52.142 --> 46:56.230
[panting, moans]

47:01.819 --> 47:03.153
I could put my drone up.

47:04.238 --> 47:05.405
No, thank you.

47:05.531 --> 47:07.115
Nelson's got us covered.

47:09.201 --> 47:11.453
-[indistinct clatter]
-Jonah, it's your turn.

47:24.925 --> 47:26.844
If we survive the night,
are we still grounded?

47:27.845 --> 47:29.596
Yes, absolutely.

47:33.141 --> 47:34.852
You know, I forgot to tell you.

47:35.936 --> 47:38.063
We're starting a charitable foundation.

47:38.438 --> 47:40.065
So, maybe you guys could...

47:41.024 --> 47:43.694
think about some of the causes
you'd like to support.

47:44.444 --> 47:45.654
That's a great idea.

47:47.155 --> 47:49.491
You could hide dirty money
as cash donations,

47:49.950 --> 47:52.035
and I guess you'd pay less money on tax,
too.

47:53.036 --> 47:53.912
Right?

47:56.123 --> 47:57.332
It's not for that.

47:58.750 --> 47:59.751
It's real.

48:02.921 --> 48:04.506
There is some good we can do.

48:06.049 --> 48:06.925
[Wendy] Hmm?

48:07.676 --> 48:10.721
Well, I think that
that's a very good idea, Mom. [chuckles]

48:15.017 --> 48:15.851
Go.

48:17.436 --> 48:18.437
I did it.

48:47.549 --> 48:50.177
You think, uh, grounding works?

48:50.928 --> 48:52.179
As a principle?

48:55.766 --> 48:57.351
About as well as prison does.

48:57.809 --> 48:58.977
What do we do?

48:59.227 --> 49:01.229
Are you kidding? We ground them.

49:02.064 --> 49:04.816
Remember in Chicago,
when they were, like, ten and seven,

49:04.900 --> 49:07.653
and they wanted to know what, uh,
murder was?

49:13.575 --> 49:14.618
Vaguely.

49:16.119 --> 49:18.413
And Jonah asked if someone was driving

49:18.497 --> 49:20.999
and they hit somebody who was walking,

49:21.083 --> 49:22.459
was that murder?

49:23.043 --> 49:25.003
And I said, "No, it was manslaughter."

49:25.420 --> 49:29.466
And he kept saying it over and over again.
"Manslaughter, manslaughter."

49:32.135 --> 49:34.137
-Why are you remembering this now?
-[chuckles]

49:34.596 --> 49:36.390
And Charlotte realized it was...

49:36.682 --> 49:38.183
"man's-laughter."

49:38.809 --> 49:40.018
It was funny.

49:41.645 --> 49:43.605
You can't-- You can't sleep out here.

49:44.481 --> 49:46.483
Just come to the bedroom, take the bed.

49:46.566 --> 49:48.902
I'll throw some cushions on the floor.

49:49.486 --> 49:50.570
It's fine.

49:53.615 --> 49:55.450
It's a house made of windows.

50:05.752 --> 50:06.920
I'll sleep in the loft.

50:22.769 --> 50:24.229
[Charlotte] What about the war on drugs?

50:24.312 --> 50:25.981
-[Wendy] Funny.
-[Charlotte snickers]

50:27.733 --> 50:28.859
[Jonah] Or animals?

50:30.527 --> 50:32.070
We could save native birds.

50:32.154 --> 50:33.113
[Wendy] Nice.

50:34.406 --> 50:35.782
There's women's issues.

50:35.949 --> 50:36.992
[Wendy] Mm-hmm.

50:39.244 --> 50:40.120
What'd she say?

50:40.996 --> 50:43.331
[sighs]
Three SUVs left early this morning.

50:43.415 --> 50:44.541
They were going north,

50:44.624 --> 50:46.835
and Helen seems to think
that they're headed to Chicago,

50:46.918 --> 50:48.920
so we're all clear.

50:50.547 --> 50:52.883
So... so that's it?

50:52.966 --> 50:54.092
[Marty] Seems like it.

50:58.430 --> 50:59.639
[Charlotte sighs]

51:05.896 --> 51:09.274
I was tired and fell asleep.
[clears throat]

51:14.821 --> 51:17.491
The drop is still on.
You know where it is?

51:18.575 --> 51:21.495
Uh, yeah. The drive-in, in Branch.

51:21.745 --> 51:23.371
Okay. Do you want some coffee?

51:23.914 --> 51:28.043
[stammers] No, I'm good.
I should probably get going, you know.

51:30.045 --> 51:31.379
[Wendy] I'll take her coffee.

51:36.343 --> 51:37.302
[Charlotte] Hmm.

51:43.934 --> 51:45.060
He's off his meds.

51:59.032 --> 52:02.202
Hey, what's the range on your drone?

52:03.745 --> 52:05.372
Three miles, about.

52:05.455 --> 52:07.165
You wanna take a drive with me?

52:08.667 --> 52:09.918
I'm grounded.

52:11.837 --> 52:12.754
So?

52:30.605 --> 52:32.274
You still have her there?

52:32.941 --> 52:35.694
Yep. She's, like, two miles ahead.

52:35.777 --> 52:37.404
[Ben] They better not fuck with her.

52:41.700 --> 52:42.826
You know,

52:43.994 --> 52:45.328
the two of us...

52:47.956 --> 52:51.042
we should drive cross-country
with the drone.

52:52.961 --> 52:55.380
[laughing]

52:55.463 --> 52:57.841
Lots of crazy-ass people

52:58.383 --> 53:00.051
in every city and town.

53:00.677 --> 53:02.262
-Whoo!
-[laughs]

53:04.931 --> 53:06.266
Maybe next summer?

53:08.935 --> 53:09.853
Yeah.

53:11.980 --> 53:13.231
That'd be awesome.

53:16.735 --> 53:17.903
[Ben] Do you see her?

53:41.259 --> 53:42.385
Fuckers.

53:51.937 --> 53:53.021
[Tommy] Go to the back.

53:58.610 --> 54:01.571
You fuckers gonna make me walk
all the way over there?

54:04.908 --> 54:05.951
Dicks.

54:17.337 --> 54:19.339
[cell phone vibrating]

54:22.509 --> 54:23.510
Oh, come on.

54:24.094 --> 54:25.178
[vibrates]

54:26.054 --> 54:28.431
-Get the fuck out of there.
-I don't have time for this.

54:28.556 --> 54:30.976
Something's fucked up. Run, now!

54:31.059 --> 54:32.811
[tires screeching]

54:33.228 --> 54:35.272
[gunfire]

54:45.448 --> 54:46.908
[Ruth gasps]

55:09.931 --> 55:10.932
[engine starts]

55:12.559 --> 55:14.811
[tires screeching]

55:42.589 --> 55:44.507
[theme music playing]
