WEBVTT

00:15.432 --> 00:17.142
SON :
Okay, so you walked Brooklyn Bridge,

00:17.142 --> 00:19.186
and that was the night you met Dad.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.438
And then how long
until you guys got together?

00:22.064 --> 00:25.692
‐ This story is about the journey,
not the destination.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.861
I'm going to get with
a whole bunch of dudes

00:27.861 --> 00:29.446
before I wind up with Dad.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.659
You know, I'm okay
with skipping to the destination.

00:33.659 --> 00:36.453
‐ I'm going to need you
to live in the moment here.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.373
Which, back in the day,
I was terrible at.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.919
After my super triumphant
Brooklyn Bridge Walk,

00:43.919 --> 00:46.004
I backslid.

00:46.004 --> 00:49.716
Instead of living in the moment,
I decided to live in my phone.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.760
‐ Morning!
‐ Can you knock?

00:51.760 --> 00:54.555
‐ Nope! Were you looking
at your old texts with Ian?

00:54.555 --> 00:55.764
‐ No.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.975
I was looking at porn.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.643
‐ Liar! You're scared of porn.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.603
‐ I'm not scared of porn.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.565
I'm scared of the government
tracking my search history.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.859
‐ Stop wallowing. Put these on.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.902
It's Fonda time!

01:08.902 --> 01:11.029
Up!

01:11.697 --> 01:13.991
So, what are we thinking for tonight?
‐ Uh,

01:13.991 --> 01:16.827
probably just going to stay in
and organize my darkroom closet.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.329
‐ You mean look at pictures of Ian

01:19.329 --> 01:21.123
while listening to
Drops of Jupiter on loop

01:21.123 --> 01:24.126
like you do every time
things don't work out with a guy?

01:24.126 --> 01:25.419
‐ : Tell me...

01:28.714 --> 01:32.217
It's my comfort song.
It works for everything.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.469
You remember when the dry cleaner
shrunk my favorite sweater?

01:37.723 --> 01:40.726
‐ You think Queen Jane stays in
on a Saturday night? No!

01:40.726 --> 01:42.895
She's out on the town, crushing dick.

01:42.895 --> 01:46.356
‐ Alright. I wish you'd stop
saying "crushing dick"

01:46.356 --> 01:49.151
about feminist icons, but you're right.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.697
‐ Good!

01:53.697 --> 01:56.825
' Cause I got us into FOMO tonight.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.036
‐ What's FOMO?

01:59.036 --> 02:00.704
‐ It stands for "fear of missing out."

02:00.704 --> 02:02.956
‐ Yeah, I know what it stands for. Thanks.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.249
How do we go to it?

02:04.249 --> 02:06.001
‐ Oh.

02:06.001 --> 02:08.003
FOMO is the name of this new club,

02:08.003 --> 02:09.963
which is a total sensory overload.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.508
There are a million different rooms.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.801
A rave room, a foam party room,

02:14.801 --> 02:16.845
a topless room, a tapas room,

02:16.845 --> 02:19.056
a topless tapas room.

02:19.056 --> 02:22.935
They say there's no such thing
as having FOMO inside of FOMO.

02:22.935 --> 02:25.354
This will be perfect for you. Plus,

02:25.354 --> 02:27.856
I'm going to need a big night out
after I end things with Charlie.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.484
‐ Wait, you're ending things with Charlie?

02:30.484 --> 02:32.945
‐ I gotta. He's smothering me.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.241
‐ Morning, Valentina!

02:37.241 --> 02:41.078
‐ I got us coffees
from a real New York bod‐ega

02:41.078 --> 02:43.288
and this chicken for dinner.
I opened the package,

02:43.288 --> 02:46.083
but I have no idea what happens next.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.918
‐ This morning,

02:47.918 --> 02:49.461
I told him the best New York bagels

02:49.461 --> 02:52.631
are in Jersey just to have
a little time to myself.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.551
Anyway, I already drafted up a text.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.803
‐ You cannot text break up with Charlie.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.222
You are crazy into the guy.
You just told me yesterday

03:00.222 --> 03:01.348
you were obsessed with him.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.308
‐ I did not.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.394
I'm obsessed with him!

03:07.062 --> 03:09.731
Fine, I'm conflicted, okay?

03:09.731 --> 03:11.275
I mean,

03:11.984 --> 03:14.027
he is fun...

03:14.027 --> 03:15.279
and sweet

03:15.279 --> 03:17.155
and hot.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.408
Plus, he does this thing
in bed with his tongue

03:19.408 --> 03:22.202
where he folds it into a cloverleaf.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.954
We call it lucky charming.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.415
‐ Uh, breakfast!

03:26.415 --> 03:29.251
Most important meal of the day!
‐ Girl...

03:29.251 --> 03:31.461
But he's always around.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.797
‐ Valentina. Of course
you think he's smothering you

03:33.797 --> 03:35.966
because you're the only person he knows

03:35.966 --> 03:37.759
in the entire city.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.636
You just have to help him
make some friends.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.805
‐ Ew. Sounds hard.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.600
‐ Yeah, well, if I have to be mature
and stop dwelling on Ian,

03:44.600 --> 03:46.143
then you need to be mature

03:46.143 --> 03:48.687
and try a little harder with Charlie.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.815
‐ Fine!

03:51.815 --> 03:53.317
Wow.

03:53.317 --> 03:56.862
I can totally feel us growing right now.
I think I finally even made good coffee.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.287
BOTH:
Mm‐hmm!

04:06.330 --> 04:09.082
‐ So, how do I make Charlie friends?

04:09.875 --> 04:11.877
Oh! I've got it.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.755
Step one,
I make him a Grindr account.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.298
Step two, the guy shows up.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.300
Step three, I lock the door...

04:18.300 --> 04:21.386
‐ Or we could invite those guys
we hung out with last weekend

04:21.386 --> 04:24.264
to come out with us. I feel like
Charlie really hit it off with them

04:24.264 --> 04:25.807
playing Drunk Face Jenga.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.018
You have to have this.
You have this.

04:30.479 --> 04:33.190
‐ Oh my god!
This is the best night of my life!

04:34.441 --> 04:37.069
‐ Soph, I don't think either
of those guys are on Grindr.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.279
‐ No! No Grindr!

04:39.279 --> 04:41.240
I'm DM‐ing Jesse.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.533
‐ Yeah. I think White Dove

04:42.533 --> 04:44.743
is going to pop way more
than Moonlight White.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.704
‐ Yeah. This will definitely be
what packs them into your bar.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.582
Everyone's going to be like,
"Hey, you got to check out Pemberton's.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.585
The upper walls are crisp AF!"

04:53.585 --> 04:57.214
‐ All I want is some regulars coming in
and ordering the usual, you know?

04:57.214 --> 04:59.842
Like when I bought this place,
I really thought I could spruce it up,

04:59.842 --> 05:02.094
make it the perfect blend
of classic New York

05:02.094 --> 05:03.136
and little titty!

05:03.136 --> 05:04.346
‐ What?
Oh,

05:04.346 --> 05:07.474
Jasper taught me some cool new slang
the NYU kids are saying.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.768
‐ Yeah, it's, uh, "litty titty," boss.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.813
‐ God, he's cool!

05:13.772 --> 05:17.192
‐ Oh. I just got a DM
from Sophie from last weekend.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.570
ALL:
Ooh!

05:19.570 --> 05:22.781
‐ Sophie likes Jesse!
‐ Does not.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.492
She's asking if we all want
to go to some club tonight.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.370
I'll just tell her that
we always spend Saturdays here,

05:28.370 --> 05:30.163
and that I hate clubs.
‐ Huh? Hey...

05:30.873 --> 05:33.000
‐ What?
‐ What are you doing?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.710
A hot, cool woman
just asked you on a date.

05:34.710 --> 05:37.045
You're really going to respond with
"I hate clubs"?

05:37.045 --> 05:38.463
‐ She didn't ask me on a date.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.257
She asked if we wanted
to hang out.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.884
And just last week,
I drove her to the airport,

05:41.884 --> 05:44.428
so she could tell another guy
that she loved him.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.430
‐ Yeah, that was last week.
And this is this week,

05:46.430 --> 05:48.849
and, clearly, she's looking
for a hot rebound thang.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.476
Ellen, you're a woman.
Tell your brother what's up.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.438
‐ I don't know if being
a woman qualifies me

05:54.438 --> 05:57.441
to decipher the DMs
of an erratic straight lady,

05:57.441 --> 05:59.276
but if I had to,

05:59.276 --> 06:01.278
yeah. She's simping.

06:02.321 --> 06:03.864
Jasper. Huh?

06:03.864 --> 06:04.865
‐ Bet.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.159
‐ You really think so?

06:07.159 --> 06:09.620
‐ I do.
And I'm not just saying that

06:09.620 --> 06:12.414
because I'm dying for my first
big New York night out.

06:12.414 --> 06:15.125
Come on, Jesse!

06:15.125 --> 06:17.711
I want to get dressed up
in a cool jumpsuit

06:17.711 --> 06:19.880
and pay too much for a cocktail,

06:19.880 --> 06:23.175
and then spill the overpriced cocktail
all over my cool jumpsuit

06:23.175 --> 06:26.345
because some club asshole
didn't look where he was going.

06:26.345 --> 06:27.721
Then be like, "Watch it!"

06:27.721 --> 06:30.015
But, he doesn't hear me
because I mumble,

06:30.015 --> 06:32.017
and the sick beats are too loud.

06:33.477 --> 06:36.522
‐ Wow. That was a very specific,

06:36.522 --> 06:38.440
very realistic fantasy.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.651
‐ And maybe, just maybe...

06:42.194 --> 06:45.113
I'd like to flirt with a cute girl
who isn't my ex‐wife.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.574
Come on. Tell her yes.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.785
You got to get back out there sometime.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.787
‐ Yeah, seriously, man.
Ever since Meredith dumped you,

06:51.787 --> 06:53.956
I've been spending
50 bucks a week on Kleenex.

06:53.956 --> 06:56.250
‐ Wait, because you're crying

06:56.250 --> 06:57.835
or because you're
going to town on yourself?

06:57.835 --> 06:59.586
‐ What? Ew! Crying!

06:59.586 --> 07:00.671
‐ Bro...

07:00.671 --> 07:02.297
‐ Crying!
‐ Bro...

07:02.798 --> 07:03.841
‐ Both.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.762
CHARLIE:
Ooh! So exciting.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.306
My first traditional
American friend setup.

07:11.306 --> 07:14.268
‐ Your what?
‐ I told him that was a thing. Be cool.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.311
‐ Ooh! Almost forgot
to put my cufflinks in.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.605
Busted out the rubies to impress the boys.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.859
‐ Oh! Charlie, come here. Look at me.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.529
Sid and Jesse don't wear cufflinks.

07:25.529 --> 07:28.365
They're just two regular New York guys.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.242
And if you want them to like you,

07:30.242 --> 07:32.995
you're just going to have
to be a little more...

07:32.995 --> 07:35.205
of the people. Okay?

07:35.205 --> 07:37.541
‐ Of course. No problem.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.877
I totally know how to do that.

07:39.877 --> 07:40.878
‐ Great.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.840
‐ My cuffs are going to be
flapping all over the place.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.466
‐ Oh! Hey!
‐ Hey!

07:47.801 --> 07:48.886
‐ Cool shirt.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.346
‐ Oh, this old thing? Thanks.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.890
‐ Alright!

07:52.890 --> 07:55.893
But just when I was ready
for a night of living in the moment...

07:58.478 --> 08:00.272
‐ Son of a bitch.

08:04.234 --> 08:07.446
‐ "My ship's deckhand
has strong Momoa vibes."

08:07.446 --> 08:09.239
‐ Ian texted you that?

08:09.239 --> 08:10.699
‐ Son of a bitch!
Right?

08:11.366 --> 08:14.453
Ian and I have this inside joke
where we sneak selfies

08:14.453 --> 08:16.205
and text them to each other
when we see someone

08:16.205 --> 08:17.956
who looks like Jason Momoa.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.125
There was Jason Mimosa,

08:20.751 --> 08:22.794
Jason Somosa,

08:23.337 --> 08:25.631
Jason with Boa.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.633
The last one was a stretch,
but I felt the pressure to text

08:27.633 --> 08:29.843
because he'd sent, like, three in a row.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.845
‐ Yeah, I'm so glad I'm engaged.

08:32.554 --> 08:36.099
‐ Ian should know that the moment
he rejected an LDR with Sophie,

08:36.099 --> 08:39.228
he lost inside joke texting privileges.
Sending this pic?

08:39.228 --> 08:42.231
Classic "have your cake and eat it, too."

08:42.231 --> 08:43.941
‐ I actually hate cake.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.361
Too hoity‐toity.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.112
I'm more of a bread guy.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.323
Plain old bread that I rip up

08:51.323 --> 08:54.952
with my rough... calloused hands.

08:56.078 --> 08:58.205
‐ Oh yeah. Yeah, b‐bread's cool.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.666
SOPHIE:
This is so messed up.

09:00.666 --> 09:03.836
I refuse to spend another second
thinking about Ian.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.465
I'm just going to write back
something super witty and charming,

09:08.465 --> 09:10.342
just so he realizes what he's missing.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.595
Okay! Okay, fine.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.180
‐ Next!

09:15.180 --> 09:18.100
No photos allowed inside of FOMO.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.977
Please put these stickers on your cameras.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.104
‐ I really don't think Sophie's into me.

09:22.104 --> 09:24.022
She's clearly still hung up
on that Ian guy.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.691
‐ Nah, I don't think so.

09:25.691 --> 09:27.943
She just got a little rattled
by his text is all.

09:28.527 --> 09:31.071
‐ Give me the best table you got, okay?
Tonight's a setup,

09:31.071 --> 09:34.199
and I'm gonna need it to be
as fun as humanly possible.

09:34.992 --> 09:38.203
‐ This is a trial‐size vitamin C
brightening serum.

09:38.662 --> 09:42.207
‐ Take care of us, and mama's got more
where that came from, daddio.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.586
‐ Did you hear that? Tonight's a setup.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.713
Valentina's trying to help her girl

09:47.713 --> 09:48.964
get with my boy.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.258
‐ Sophie did say my shirt was cool.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.468
‐ She compliments the shirt
to get into the pants.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.555
This is going to be the worst place ever.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.182
This is the best place ever!

09:58.182 --> 10:00.434
I wanted to hate the nostalgic candy room.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.352
Mm‐mmm! Look at me now!

10:05.105 --> 10:07.316
‐ Is that girl making eyes at me,

10:07.316 --> 10:09.234
or is she trying to blink
something out of her eye?

10:09.234 --> 10:13.238
‐ Woo‐woo!
To a night of bonding with new friends!

10:13.238 --> 10:15.616
And being in the moment.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.826
Especially you guys, the three musketeers.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.912
‐ The three who?

10:19.912 --> 10:23.498
What is that, some sort of
fancy pants literary reference?

10:23.498 --> 10:24.791
I'm not much of a reader, you know.

10:24.791 --> 10:28.587
Just give me the big game
and a cold can of "puh‐buh‐ruh."

10:28.587 --> 10:30.714
‐ What? What's "puh‐buh‐ruh"?

10:32.216 --> 10:34.092
‐ Oh, it's that cheap beer

10:34.092 --> 10:36.887
that we regular men... love.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.138
‐ Do you mean PBR?

10:39.681 --> 10:41.767
‐ Is that how it's pronounced? As PBR?

10:41.767 --> 10:43.769
‐ :
Oh, this is a disaster.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.688
‐ We just locked eyes again.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.482
Okay, I'm going to go ask
to buy her a drink.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.653
‐ Oh!

10:52.653 --> 10:53.904
‐ I'm good!

11:04.540 --> 11:06.458
‐ So this is pretty great, huh?

11:06.458 --> 11:08.460
If you told 8‐year‐old me
that I'd be at a club

11:08.460 --> 11:11.088
with a hula hoop room,
I'd have totally lost my shit.

11:11.922 --> 11:12.965
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

11:12.965 --> 11:14.800
No, I was really into
hula hooping growing up.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.219
My mom said I had the loosest
hips in Cincinnati.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.638
Which I'm now realizing
is a very disturbing thing

11:19.638 --> 11:21.223
to say to a young child.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.434
Um...

11:24.434 --> 11:27.521
Do‐do you want to go to the,
uh, candle room for a drink?

11:27.521 --> 11:30.357
‐ And that's when I realized
that there was

11:30.357 --> 11:32.901
a totally sweet, interested guy

11:32.901 --> 11:34.570
right in front of me.

11:35.279 --> 11:36.822
‐ Yeah.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.657
Yeah. I do.

11:38.657 --> 11:41.201
‐ Cool. Uh, okay,
I'll get drinks. I'll meet you there.

11:46.290 --> 11:49.293
FUTURE SOPHIE:
But then, I spotted him, right there,

11:49.293 --> 11:50.878
in the middle of FOMO.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.005
The ultimate Momoa‐lookalike.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.592
‐ FOMO‐Moa.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.014
‐ Hey! H‐how's it going
with Eye Contact Girl?

12:02.014 --> 12:04.224
‐ Oh, I moved on to No Bra Bethany!

12:05.976 --> 12:07.227
She's really nice.

12:09.479 --> 12:10.814
FUTURE SOPHIE:
It was like the universe

12:10.814 --> 12:13.775
was testing my willpower
to stay in the moment,

12:13.775 --> 12:16.570
and I was immediately failing that test.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.946
I had to get a picture.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.656
‐ Hey!

12:19.656 --> 12:22.576
You're taking a picture
of that Momoa for Ian.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.037
‐ I wanna send him a stupid text
to make him laugh.

12:25.037 --> 12:26.663
So then, he'll write me back
and make me laugh.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.290
And if that's immature, I just don't care!

12:28.290 --> 12:31.585
‐ Well, if you get to text Ian,
then I get to break up with Charlie.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.837
‐ Fine! I say, do it.

12:33.837 --> 12:36.298
Screw being mature.
Alright? We're young!

12:36.298 --> 12:38.592
We can still make
bad choices for a few more years.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.678
‐ Yes! That's how we'll learn
the lessons we need to become

12:41.678 --> 12:44.515
super‐wise dick‐crushing old people
like Jane Fonda.

12:44.515 --> 12:45.682
‐ Exactly!

12:46.517 --> 12:48.060
Good talk.
‐ Yep. Love you.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.311
‐ Love you.
‐ Bye.

12:50.729 --> 12:51.855
‐ Alright.

12:53.649 --> 12:54.733
I got ya.

12:55.651 --> 12:57.402
‐ Hey!

12:57.402 --> 12:59.154
No photos at FOMO!

12:59.154 --> 13:02.199
Especially here at FOMO Soho.
At FOMO Noho,

13:02.199 --> 13:04.409
you want a photo? Sure! YOLO!

13:04.409 --> 13:08.080
But at Soho FOMO, photos are no‐no.
You gotta go, yo!

13:14.086 --> 13:16.755
‐ So, what's your favorite
entry‐level sedan?

13:17.881 --> 13:21.343
‐ Have you guys seen Sophie anywhere?
‐ Uh, no.

13:21.343 --> 13:24.596
‐ Well, if this is a setup,
it's the worst setup I've ever been on.

13:24.596 --> 13:27.057
‐ This is a setup between
Jesse and Sophie, too?

13:27.057 --> 13:28.976
‐ Uh, what do you mean "too"?

13:28.976 --> 13:31.937
‐ Well, Valentina's setting
the three of us up tonight,

13:31.937 --> 13:34.231
on a traditional
American friends setup.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.400
‐ Charlie!

13:36.400 --> 13:39.194
We need to talk.
‐ Hey, uh, quick Q.

13:39.194 --> 13:42.447
Is tonight a setup between Charlie
and us or Jesse and Sophie?

13:42.447 --> 13:44.700
‐ Charlie and you guys.
Sophie isn't ready for a setup.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.201
She's still totally obsessed with Ian.

13:46.201 --> 13:47.995
Oh no.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.998
Did you think tonight
was about you and Sophie?

13:50.998 --> 13:53.375
‐ You know, I really,
really didn't, but...

13:54.293 --> 13:56.211
someone convinced me it was.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.131
‐ I'm sorry, man.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.175
Let's just go back to my bar, okay?

14:01.175 --> 14:03.677
With its lackluster drinks
and zero activities.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.180
Hey! Maybe Jasper will hang out with us.

14:09.224 --> 14:10.726
Your sister's got game.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.770
‐ Be honest with me.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.982
Is a traditional American friend setup
even a thing?

14:17.733 --> 14:19.276
‐ No, it's not.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.112
I thought maybe if you had
your own crew to hang out with,

14:22.112 --> 14:23.822
I would feel less smothered.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.074
‐ You feel smothered?

14:26.825 --> 14:29.161
But I'm always the little spoon.

14:29.161 --> 14:32.247
‐ You're great, Charlie,
but you're just...

14:32.247 --> 14:34.666
always there,
and it‐it's just too much for me.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.668
I think we should go our separate ways.

14:36.668 --> 14:39.004
‐ Well, why didn't you just tell me
that you needed space?

14:39.004 --> 14:41.215
That's why you sent me
to Jersey for the bagels. Okay.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.841
Wow.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.219
If this is how you deal
with the tiniest little wrinkle,

14:45.219 --> 14:46.470
then I agree.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.388
We should end things.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.523
Can't believe I lucky charmed you
twice this morning.

14:58.357 --> 15:02.194
‐ I crunched your captain twice, too!
It was an even trade!

15:03.987 --> 15:05.531
‐ :

15:11.787 --> 15:14.873
‐ :

15:20.295 --> 15:23.298
‐ I got kicked out of FOMO.
‐ I broke up with Charlie.

15:24.383 --> 15:25.592
‐ How did he take it?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.512
‐ He said I should have just
told him I needed some space.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.849
‐ Funny. I never thought of that.

15:31.849 --> 15:34.142
‐ I thought of it.
I just didn't wanna do it

15:34.142 --> 15:37.020
'cause if you tell a guy
what you need, and he does it,

15:37.020 --> 15:39.523
then when he tells you what
he needs, you have to do it.

15:40.315 --> 15:43.652
And I don't want to do that.
I only want to do exactly what I want

15:43.652 --> 15:45.904
when I want, how I want.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.991
‐ And now, you can.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.202
‐ Did Ian like your Momoa pic?

15:52.202 --> 15:54.162
‐ I haven't sent it.

15:54.162 --> 15:57.040
I can't decide if I'm going to.
‐ Mm.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.126
You know,

15:59.126 --> 16:02.004
Jesse thought you invited everyone out
tonight because you were into him.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.673
‐ Oh my god, I left him waiting
for me in the candle room!

16:05.215 --> 16:06.967
And his shirt looked very flammable.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.385
‐ Don't worry, he got out.

16:08.385 --> 16:10.721
All the guys left.

16:11.305 --> 16:13.724
‐ Looks like you two
are having a good night.

16:13.724 --> 16:15.350
‐ Who hurt you!?

16:20.731 --> 16:23.066
‐ Gin martini with a twist.
‐ Thanks.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.112
Mm.

16:27.112 --> 16:29.406
And thanks for giving me another chance.

16:29.406 --> 16:30.616
Mates.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.951
I swear when I'm allowed
to be my normal fancy self,

16:32.951 --> 16:34.536
I'm an absolute bloody delight.

16:35.871 --> 16:37.998
‐ Those cufflinks are gorgeous.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.128
‐ : Thank you.

16:44.713 --> 16:47.424
By the way, I noticed how crisp
your upper walls look.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.551
Is it White Dove?

16:50.344 --> 16:53.347
‐ Yeah. Yeah, it is.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.682
‐ Hey.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.100
Come here, we need to talk.

17:01.897 --> 17:03.190
SID:
Ooh...

17:03.190 --> 17:05.651
‐ Here. It's from Essa Bagel.

17:05.651 --> 17:07.277
Best bagels in the city.

17:07.277 --> 17:09.530
It's where I should have
sent you instead of Jersey.

17:10.531 --> 17:12.699
‐ Well, I mean,
how different can they be?

17:15.202 --> 17:18.455
Oh my god, those Jersey bagels
are just little shit circles, aren't they?

17:19.331 --> 17:20.624
‐ You were right.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.584
I should have just told you
that I needed some space.

17:22.584 --> 17:24.878
I'm... really sorry.

17:27.965 --> 17:29.800
‐ This isn't going to work.

17:30.968 --> 17:32.344
‐ Oh.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.972
‐ You know, living together,
it's... it's too much.

17:36.181 --> 17:37.933
So, I am going to move out.

17:38.684 --> 17:40.018
‐ Oh.

17:40.727 --> 17:44.022
‐ Then, I would like
to take you on a first date.

17:45.566 --> 17:46.859
‐ Oh?

17:46.859 --> 17:49.069
‐ We never really had one of those.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.488
We do need to take a step back and...

17:52.155 --> 17:53.824
start at the beginning.

17:54.533 --> 17:55.826
‐ I'd love that.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.663
‐ So, seeing as how
we're easing into things,

17:59.663 --> 18:01.707
we probably shouldn't go
and have sex in the storage closet.

18:01.707 --> 18:03.750
Bring the bagel.

18:08.547 --> 18:11.175
‐ Hey! How you guys doing? Don't care!

18:12.176 --> 18:15.679
I just had the best night of my life!

18:15.679 --> 18:17.514
‐ Somebody get lucky at Club FOMO?

18:17.514 --> 18:18.891
‐ No!

18:19.433 --> 18:22.144
‐ I was rejected constantly.
‐ Hi! I'm Ellen...

18:23.312 --> 18:26.023
I got way too drunk way too fast,

18:26.023 --> 18:28.942
and struck out many, many times.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.652
Cheers.

18:32.988 --> 18:34.489
‐ So, why are you so happy?

18:34.489 --> 18:37.826
‐ Because even though five... No, wait.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.453
Six!

18:39.453 --> 18:42.122
Six women didn't want
to give me their numbers,

18:42.122 --> 18:45.292
there are so many more out there
waiting for me.

18:45.292 --> 18:48.086
New York rules!
Woo!

18:48.086 --> 18:49.546
‐ I'll drink to that!

18:50.714 --> 18:53.050
‐ Just play, damn it.

18:53.050 --> 18:55.302
Really need this right now.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.012
Why does everything in the world hate me?

18:57.638 --> 18:58.639
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

18:58.639 --> 18:59.973
Hey!

18:59.973 --> 19:02.100
Just... playing a song.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.478
No big thang.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.566
‐ I hope this doesn't
make you feel too uncomfortable,

19:09.566 --> 19:11.944
but I know that
you thought tonight was a setup.

19:12.611 --> 19:16.031
‐ I'm extremely uncomfortable,
but go ahead.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.743
‐ I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

19:19.743 --> 19:22.079
And for standing you up
in the candle room earlier.

19:22.079 --> 19:25.541
‐ It's fine. I mean, it stung for a sec,
but nothing a quick spin

19:25.541 --> 19:28.460
in the old hula hoop room
couldn't fix.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.424
‐ Jesse...

19:35.676 --> 19:37.094
I'm a mess right now.

19:38.053 --> 19:40.556
And I know that you've been
through a lot with your ex,

19:41.682 --> 19:44.351
and that dating in the city
can make you feel...

19:44.351 --> 19:47.020
hopeless and alone and like
you will never find someone

19:47.020 --> 19:50.148
who realizes how amazing you are.

19:50.148 --> 19:53.861
And... I don't want to be one of
those people who make you feel like that.

19:55.821 --> 19:57.322
Because I actually can see it.

20:00.534 --> 20:02.536
‐ I'm a mess, too.

20:02.536 --> 20:04.246
I mean, it literally took all of my energy

20:04.246 --> 20:06.623
just to put this stupid shirt on
and leave the house tonight,

20:06.623 --> 20:08.625
and being in that...

20:08.625 --> 20:11.378
horrible club just made me
miss staying home

20:11.378 --> 20:13.088
and watching Love Island with Meredith.

20:13.088 --> 20:15.299
Even though Meredith is a terrible person

20:15.299 --> 20:16.967
who publicly rejected my proposal

20:16.967 --> 20:18.635
and took my cat in our breakup.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.554
‐ Oh! She got the cat?

20:20.554 --> 20:22.723
‐ No, not the cat. My cat.

20:22.723 --> 20:25.184
My 11‐year‐old cat
that I rescued from a shelter,

20:25.184 --> 20:28.187
and named Girl so that
I could call her Jesse's Girl.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.772
‐ Oh my god...

20:33.358 --> 20:35.569
And now you wish
that you had Jesse's Girl.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.573
‐ Like I said, I'm a mess, too.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.744
‐ Well, maybe we could
be friends that are messes

20:43.744 --> 20:45.829
instead of two messes who try to date

20:45.829 --> 20:49.374
because that would just
inevitably be... a mess.

20:50.709 --> 20:53.420
‐ Yeah, that sounds like
a really good plan.

20:55.339 --> 20:57.799
Oh! Hello, everyone.

21:01.929 --> 21:03.597
‐ Why are you covered in poppy seeds?

21:03.597 --> 21:04.973
‐ Don't worry about it.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.144
‐ I'll have another drink, please.
Just the usual.

21:09.144 --> 21:11.480
‐ Gin martini with a twist
coming right up.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.984
He has a usual! Jasper.

21:15.984 --> 21:18.403
Jasper... He has a usual.

21:18.403 --> 21:20.197
‐ Yo, that's fire, man.

21:20.197 --> 21:22.366
Yo, I need, uh, next Saturday off.

21:23.033 --> 21:25.327
Um, also, right now, I'm leaving early.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.829
‐ Hey, buh‐buh‐buh! You got it, buddy.
Get out of here.

21:29.998 --> 21:31.458
‐ Is this...
Yes.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.378
Drops of Jupiter.
I‐I know it's kind of cheesy,

21:34.378 --> 21:37.381
but it's just...
sort of my comfort song.

21:42.886 --> 21:45.973
It was hard to live
in the moment in 2022.

21:45.973 --> 21:49.059
There was always someplace
else you could be,

21:49.059 --> 21:50.811
someone else you could be with.

21:50.811 --> 21:52.980
But every once in a while,

21:52.980 --> 21:55.649
you found yourself in
the exact right spot.

21:56.817 --> 21:59.695
And you had that rarest of moments

21:59.695 --> 22:03.574
where you had absolutely no FOMO,

22:03.574 --> 22:07.160
and you could just... be.
