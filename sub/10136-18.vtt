07:47.508 --> 07:50.804
Two thousand dollars?

07:47.508 --> 07:50.804
For Nolan Ryan?

07:50.845 --> 07:52.347
I just had that card.

07:52.389 --> 07:55.725
Stretch Limo, here I come!

07:55.767 --> 07:57.978
I thought you said

07:55.767 --> 07:57.978
you didn't like Limos.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.063
That was before

07:58.019 --> 08:00.063
I had a rich boyfriend.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.149
You still don't.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.149
It's my money.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.443
Dream on.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.443
You gave that card to Steve!

08:04.484 --> 08:06.069
- I was cleaning out Joey's car.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.069
- You just handed it to him.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.946
[blows toot]

08:07.988 --> 08:10.573
Girls, could someone calmly

08:10.615 --> 08:12.075
explain to me

08:10.615 --> 08:12.075
what's going on here?

08:12.117 --> 08:13.743
- Okay.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.743
- Sure.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.120
See, I was cleaning out

08:13.785 --> 08:15.120
Joey's car and I brought it in--

08:15.162 --> 08:17.247
She gave the card to Steve,

08:15.162 --> 08:17.247
so the money is..

08:19.166 --> 08:21.960
[all laughing]

08:22.002 --> 08:25.130
And when we get to the museum,

08:22.002 --> 08:25.130
we've got to see those dead guys

08:25.172 --> 08:26.881
wrapped up in toilet paper.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.093
- Ew!

08:26.923 --> 08:30.093
- 'Ew!'

08:30.135 --> 08:32.387
Alright, let's get this

08:30.135 --> 08:32.387
prehistoric party on the road!

08:32.429 --> 08:34.097
- Is everybody pumped?

08:32.429 --> 08:34.097
- Oh, yes!

08:34.139 --> 08:38.143
I was awake all night

08:34.139 --> 08:38.143
in anticipation.

08:41.562 --> 08:44.149
I bet you were, Derek.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.109
Why'd Mrs. Gwelf

08:44.191 --> 08:46.109
have to get sick?

08:46.151 --> 08:48.569
Now, we're stuck with<i> you.</i>

08:49.654 --> 08:51.572
[chuckles]

08:51.614 --> 08:53.116
Aaron, my boy, you know

08:53.158 --> 08:55.243
why don't we, uh, just

08:53.158 --> 08:55.243
drop you off at her house.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.954
Maybe she has

08:55.285 --> 08:57.954
something contagious.

09:00.748 --> 09:03.377
Uncle Jesse, can we

09:00.748 --> 09:03.377
bring some music?

09:03.418 --> 09:05.379
Sure, Michelle.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.379
We're here to have a good time.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.339
- Crank it up, sista.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.339
- Cool.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.298
[pop music]

09:08.340 --> 09:10.300
(in unison)

09:08.340 --> 09:10.300
Yay!

09:10.342 --> 09:13.303
[upbeat music]

09:13.345 --> 09:15.596
[chuckling]

09:29.277 --> 09:30.611
Okay. Alright!

09:30.653 --> 09:31.988
Settle down, settle down.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.324
Whoa! Off my couch.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.324
Off my couch, buddy.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.450
Settle down, please.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.160
Settle, hello!

09:37.202 --> 09:39.579
[music stops]

09:39.620 --> 09:41.581
Jess, I thought you were

09:39.620 --> 09:41.581
gonna get the kids organized.

09:41.622 --> 09:42.832
Oh, they're organized.

09:42.874 --> 09:46.169
They're all here.

09:42.874 --> 09:46.169
No one's bleeding.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.255
Alright, kids, today,

09:46.211 --> 09:48.255
we're gonna learn a whole lot

09:48.296 --> 09:49.797
and we're gonna

09:48.296 --> 09:49.797
have a wonderful time.

09:49.839 --> 09:50.965
We're gonna pair off in buddies

09:51.007 --> 09:52.217
and we're gonna

09:51.007 --> 09:52.217
explore the museum

09:52.259 --> 09:53.676
in two nice straight lines.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.346
Danny, it's a field trip,

09:53.718 --> 09:56.346
not boot camp.

09:56.388 --> 09:57.722
Jess, kids need the rules.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.516
Our prisons are

09:57.764 --> 09:59.516
chock-full of people

09:59.558 --> 10:03.103
who went on field trips, where

09:59.558 --> 10:03.103
nobody told 'em the rules.

10:03.144 --> 10:07.607
Hey, can we go before we're

10:03.144 --> 10:07.607
as old as the<i> dinosaurs?</i>

10:07.648 --> 10:09.401
Uh, I got an idea.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.401
You know what?

10:09.443 --> 10:12.070
We'll split the little goobers

10:09.443 --> 10:12.070
up into two little groups..

10:12.112 --> 10:13.821
...you do your thing

10:12.112 --> 10:13.821
and I'll do my thing.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.532
Okay, okay, fine.

10:15.574 --> 10:18.452
Okay, everybody that wants

10:15.574 --> 10:18.452
a day of, of adventure

10:18.493 --> 10:20.537
and<i> enlightenment,</i>

10:18.493 --> 10:20.537
line up with me right over here.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.414
[clinking]

10:22.456 --> 10:25.708
And everyone who wants to

10:22.456 --> 10:25.708
get down with the dinosaurs..

10:25.750 --> 10:28.836
...hustle your

10:25.750 --> 10:28.836
little heinies over here.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.505
Okay, everybody

10:30.547 --> 10:31.965
'arms down at your sides.'

10:32.006 --> 10:33.800
Stand up straight, chest out.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.218
And stare at the back

10:33.841 --> 10:35.218
of the head of the person

10:35.260 --> 10:37.845
in front of you. Not you.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.598
Okay, everybody, get in

10:37.887 --> 10:39.598
a circle, put your hands in.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.724
Alright, that's good.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.059
Alright.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.064
Hey, Michelle,

10:45.520 --> 10:48.064
welcome to the group.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.983
Is it alright

10:48.106 --> 10:49.983
if I go with them?

10:52.277 --> 10:56.239
Sure. Sure. You go ahead.

10:52.277 --> 10:56.239
Do...you do whatever you want.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.782
- Alright. Come on, Michelle.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.782
- Alright.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.993
Put your hand in.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.993
We're in a fun group today!

11:00.034 --> 11:02.412
(kids)

11:00.034 --> 11:02.412
'Yay!'

11:12.922 --> 11:16.343
Kids, quiet, please.

11:12.922 --> 11:16.343
No chewing gum.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.261
'Cause we're in a museum.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.180
That rhymed, isn't that funny?

11:18.303 --> 11:20.180
I made that up.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.973
[sighing]

11:20.221 --> 11:21.973
Ah, look at this.

11:22.015 --> 11:25.059
This is a fine specimen

11:22.015 --> 11:25.059
of dinosaurhood, isn't it?

11:25.101 --> 11:26.311
This is, uh,

11:25.101 --> 11:26.311
this is my old friend.

11:26.353 --> 11:30.106
This is, uh,

11:26.353 --> 11:30.106
tsintaosaurus spinorhinus.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.690
He was a bird-hipped dinosaur

11:31.732 --> 11:35.153
that, uh, belonged to the

11:31.732 --> 11:35.153
hadrosaur or duck-billed family

11:35.195 --> 11:38.114
of plant-eating dinosaurs.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.114
That was way back.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.950
At end of the, uh, mesozoic era.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.994
- Yes, Terri.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.994
- You're smart.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.621
You should be on "Jeopardy!"

11:45.913 --> 11:47.374
Aw, thanks, Terri.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.916
He's not smart.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.877
He's reading the plaque.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.837
[all laughing]

11:52.879 --> 11:55.006
You know, Aaron..

11:55.048 --> 11:56.799
...one of the reasons

11:55.048 --> 11:56.799
this guy's extinct

11:56.841 --> 12:00.679
is 'cause he talked back

11:56.841 --> 12:00.679
to a bigger dinosaur.

12:00.719 --> 12:03.682
Sorry, sir.

12:00.719 --> 12:03.682
It'll never happen again.

12:03.722 --> 12:04.849
Alright. Now, look at that.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.226
[chuckles]

12:08.186 --> 12:09.479
[kids laughing]

12:13.191 --> 12:16.027
Well, look who's here.

12:13.191 --> 12:16.027
The Wild Bunch.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.529
Alright, gang. Look at this.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.365
This is the, uh,

12:17.571 --> 12:20.365
rare bonehead-a-saurus.

12:20.407 --> 12:24.411
Oh, not the tall kid with

12:20.407 --> 12:24.411
a tie, the big brown one.

12:24.452 --> 12:27.706
How come you never see these

12:24.452 --> 12:27.706
guys hanging out anymore?

12:27.746 --> 12:30.417
'Cause they used to live

12:27.746 --> 12:30.417
with the Fred Flintstones

12:30.458 --> 12:33.461
but then they got canceled.

12:33.503 --> 12:37.424
Well, Jess, I don't hear

12:33.503 --> 12:37.424
any sirens going off. Uh..

12:37.465 --> 12:40.427
So, I assume your group's

12:37.465 --> 12:40.427
been behaving themselves.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.263
Well, actually,

12:40.468 --> 12:43.263
Colonel Compulsive

12:43.304 --> 12:45.014
we're having a very

12:43.304 --> 12:45.014
educational afternoon.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.933
Michelle, tell your old man

12:45.056 --> 12:46.933
what you learned today.

12:46.974 --> 12:49.852
We learned about whales,

12:46.974 --> 12:49.852
mummies and birds.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.480
You see that? Whales, mummies,

12:49.894 --> 12:52.480
and birds, okay?

12:52.522 --> 12:53.772
So, you can have fun and learn

12:53.814 --> 12:55.149
at the same time.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.149
It's very simple.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.944
But the most fun

12:55.191 --> 12:57.944
was the escalator races.

12:57.985 --> 13:01.531
Whoa! Stop it with

12:57.985 --> 13:01.531
the escalator races.

13:01.573 --> 13:04.367
Escalator races?

13:01.573 --> 13:04.367
That's fascinating.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.869
Guess we must've missed

13:04.409 --> 13:06.869
that exhibit, huh?

13:06.911 --> 13:09.830
Okay, my group of well-behaved,

13:06.911 --> 13:09.830
beautiful children

13:09.872 --> 13:11.249
I'd like you to stay in

13:09.872 --> 13:11.249
this room and check out

13:11.291 --> 13:12.791
the rest of the exhibit, okay?

13:12.833 --> 13:15.420
Now, find your buddy.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.755
Alright.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.881
Have fun.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.760
Okay, my very cool group,

13:18.923 --> 13:21.760
find your buddy.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.304
Whoa! Ho ho.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.304
See? I'm their buddy.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.097
Okay. Okay, good.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.266
Now, you guys run off

13:26.139 --> 13:28.266
and have some fun, but learn.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.561
Okay? Learn and have fun.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.854
You see, Danny, you don't have

13:31.603 --> 13:33.854
to treat the kids like soldiers.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.440
You know, you let 'em

13:33.896 --> 13:35.440
have a little freedom

13:35.482 --> 13:36.941
and you'll be

13:35.482 --> 13:36.941
surprised what they do.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.653
Oh, yeah. They're mastering

13:36.983 --> 13:39.653
the limbo over there.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.449
Danny, relax.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.742
They're just

13:44.491 --> 13:45.742
havin' a little fun.

13:45.784 --> 13:48.244
No harm done, brother man.

13:48.286 --> 13:51.164
Yeah, yeah, no harm done,

13:48.286 --> 13:51.164
brother man!

13:51.205 --> 13:52.831
I don't need to take

13:51.205 --> 13:52.831
advice from a guy who spent

13:52.873 --> 13:54.668
his entire childhood

13:52.873 --> 13:54.668
in the principal's office.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.795
Look who's talking, here's

13:54.709 --> 13:56.795
the guy who was so proud to be

13:56.835 --> 13:58.421
the hall monitor

13:56.835 --> 13:58.421
just so he could bust people

13:58.463 --> 14:01.466
because they put their lips

13:58.463 --> 14:01.466
on the drinking fountain.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.967
If wasn't for guys like you,

14:01.508 --> 14:02.967
we wouldn't have needed

14:03.009 --> 14:04.552
hall monitors in

14:03.009 --> 14:04.552
the first place.

14:04.594 --> 14:05.844
What's your problem today, man?

14:05.886 --> 14:07.347
Hey, I don't have

14:05.886 --> 14:07.347
any problems, you know.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.515
If that sign didn't say

14:07.388 --> 14:08.515
"Quiet, please"

14:08.556 --> 14:10.141
I'd tell you what

14:08.556 --> 14:10.141
your problem was.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.144
Oh, who cares about being quiet.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.144
Everything in here's dead.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.356
[scoffs]

14:13.186 --> 14:16.356
Yeah, but your group's

14:13.186 --> 14:16.356
alive and kickin'.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.150
Aw, Derek, not you.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.777
Hey! Now, stop

14:19.192 --> 14:20.777
throwing those pamph..

14:20.819 --> 14:23.070
Hey, if throw another pamphlet

14:20.819 --> 14:23.070
I'm coming up there.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.948
Alright, one more after that,

14:23.112 --> 14:25.948
I'm running up those stairs.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.326
(Jesse)

14:25.990 --> 14:28.326
'Alright, come on. Let's

14:25.990 --> 14:28.326
pick 'em up, pick 'em up..'

14:28.368 --> 14:31.538
Alright. My group,

14:28.368 --> 14:31.538
everybody line up over here.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.581
[clicking]

14:33.623 --> 14:34.791
Perfect. Okay.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.167
Now, we're going to all march

14:36.209 --> 14:38.294
into the wonderful world

14:36.209 --> 14:38.294
of rocks and minerals.

14:38.336 --> 14:39.671
You ready?

14:38.336 --> 14:39.671
Hold onto your socks.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.506
We're going to see rocks.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.927
Hey, Michelle,

14:44.008 --> 14:46.927
you want to play tag?

14:46.969 --> 14:48.095
You think we should?

14:48.137 --> 14:51.224
Of course. We're the fun group.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.433
Oh, yeah.

14:52.475 --> 14:53.893
And you're it.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.144
[both chuckling]

14:55.186 --> 14:57.271
(Jesse)

14:55.186 --> 14:57.271
'Hold it! Whoa! Hey! Stop!'

14:58.481 --> 14:59.733
Mellow out.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.901
[both laughing]

15:01.942 --> 15:03.737
Hey! Drop that dinosaur!

15:03.778 --> 15:05.530
I mean, set it down gingerly.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.741
Guys, guys.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.576
Hey, stop it!

15:07.782 --> 15:09.576
Give me that thing!

15:09.617 --> 15:11.035
Give me that.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.750
(Michelle)

15:13.454 --> 15:16.750
You can't get me.

15:17.958 --> 15:21.045
You can't get me.

15:17.958 --> 15:21.045
You can't..

15:21.504 --> 15:23.172
Oops!

15:23.214 --> 15:25.383
Uh-oh!

15:26.718 --> 15:29.262
[intense music]

15:51.033 --> 15:53.578
[girl screaming]

15:59.709 --> 16:01.001
Are you guys okay?

16:07.801 --> 16:10.428
I broke the dinosaur.

16:12.806 --> 16:15.892
Man, there's nothing

16:12.806 --> 16:15.892
left but his butt.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.315
[instrumental music]

16:22.356 --> 16:24.317
Alright, don't panic.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.317
Everything's gonna be okay.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.820
Don't panic,

16:24.358 --> 16:26.820
all we have to do is..

16:26.861 --> 16:28.613
...put it back together somehow.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.448
How's that song go?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.448
Oh, I-I got it.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.658
Uh, oh! Alright.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.534
Leg bone is connected to a, uh..

16:33.576 --> 16:34.702
...the foot bone.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.246
And a foot bone is..

16:37.288 --> 16:38.957
...connected to

16:37.288 --> 16:38.957
a rib bone, of course.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.708
A foot, rib bone..

16:40.750 --> 16:43.169
(Jesse)

16:40.750 --> 16:43.169
'The rib bone is connected to..'

16:43.210 --> 16:45.296
Jesse!

16:45.338 --> 16:46.881
What did you do?

16:51.427 --> 16:53.053
Do you have any glue?

17:02.104 --> 17:03.439
Okay, thank you.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.232
- Was Steve there?

17:03.481 --> 17:05.232
- No!

17:05.274 --> 17:07.861
I called the Pizza Shack, the

17:05.274 --> 17:07.861
Waffle Hut, the Burger Corral

17:07.902 --> 17:10.697
and the Falafel House

17:07.902 --> 17:10.697
and they all said the same thing

17:10.738 --> 17:12.573
"He just left."

17:12.615 --> 17:14.408
Deej, it's obvious

17:12.615 --> 17:14.408
what happened.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.453
Steve finds out the Nolan Ryan

17:14.450 --> 17:17.453
card is worth big bucks.

17:17.495 --> 17:19.330
Now, he's got two grand

17:17.495 --> 17:19.330
in his pocket.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.707
So, he carbo loads

17:20.748 --> 17:22.667
flies to Fort Lauderdale

17:20.748 --> 17:22.667
and becomes a judge

17:22.709 --> 17:26.045
in the Sun and Buns

17:22.709 --> 17:26.045
bikini contest.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.505
Thanks, Kimmy.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.589
Hey, that's what grandpa

17:28.631 --> 17:30.174
did when he won the lotto.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.636
Hi! Have you decided

17:32.051 --> 17:33.636
who the card belongs to?

17:33.678 --> 17:35.221
- It's still mine.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.221
- The card belongs to Steve's.

17:35.262 --> 17:37.097
Joey told me that I could have..

17:37.139 --> 17:39.058
I see you're still

17:37.139 --> 17:39.058
working on it.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.353
Hey, does Joey know about this?

17:42.395 --> 17:43.771
Know about what?

17:43.813 --> 17:46.190
Joey, remember all that

17:43.813 --> 17:46.190
junks from your car?

17:46.232 --> 17:47.692
Uh-huh! Yeah.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.318
Well, there was a Nolan Ryan

17:49.360 --> 17:52.822
baseball card in there

17:49.360 --> 17:52.822
worth $2,000.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.451
Two thousand dollars?

17:57.493 --> 17:59.453
A two with, with three zeros?

18:00.914 --> 18:02.248
[water splashing]

18:05.334 --> 18:06.961
Oh, we're out of juice.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.590
- Hey, everybody.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.590
- Where have you been?

18:10.631 --> 18:12.926
Hey, Steph, did you know that

18:10.631 --> 18:12.926
one of those baseball cards

18:12.967 --> 18:15.302
that you gave me is worth money?

18:15.344 --> 18:17.638
Really? Fork it over.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.891
Well, it's too late.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.267
I already sold it

18:19.933 --> 18:21.267
to my brother's friend

18:21.308 --> 18:23.811
for a pretty nice

18:21.308 --> 18:23.811
chunk of change.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.354
Yes!

18:25.396 --> 18:27.231
And, Steph, since

18:25.396 --> 18:27.231
you gave me the card

18:27.273 --> 18:28.357
the money goes to you.

18:28.399 --> 18:29.734
Yes!

18:29.776 --> 18:32.319
Steve, did you know that

18:29.776 --> 18:32.319
Joey gave her that card?

18:32.361 --> 18:34.906
Oh, really, then

18:32.361 --> 18:34.906
I guess the right thing to do is

18:34.948 --> 18:36.616
I give the money to Joey.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.701
- No!

18:38.743 --> 18:40.078
Yes!

18:40.119 --> 18:42.038
And, uh, Steve, since you

18:40.119 --> 18:42.038
did the right thing

18:42.080 --> 18:43.330
I'm gonna do the right thing

18:43.372 --> 18:45.458
I'm gonna split the money

18:43.372 --> 18:45.458
with all you guys.

18:45.499 --> 18:48.419
- Yeah!

18:45.499 --> 18:48.419
- Yes! My new bike.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.421
Prom in a Limo!

18:50.463 --> 18:53.091
You know, I've never

18:50.463 --> 18:53.091
been to Dollywood.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.471
How are you gonna do

18:55.760 --> 18:58.471
all that on 30 bucks?

19:00.765 --> 19:02.600
What are you saying?

19:02.642 --> 19:05.519
Is that a three with one zero?

19:06.938 --> 19:10.024
- Hey, Donald Chump.

19:06.938 --> 19:10.024
- That card's worth 2,000 bucks.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.233
What?

19:11.275 --> 19:13.193
That little twerp ripped me off?

19:13.235 --> 19:14.570
Well, don't worry, okay?

19:14.612 --> 19:16.238
Because I'm gonna get

19:14.612 --> 19:16.238
the card back for us.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.907
Well, Steve, what if he

19:16.280 --> 19:17.907
doesn't wanna give it back.

19:17.949 --> 19:19.075
He's nine years old.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.535
I'm captain of

19:19.117 --> 19:21.535
the wrestling team.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.121
We'll work it out.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.207
You gotta love him.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.130
Hey, Jess!

19:32.171 --> 19:34.381
Tell me again, the foot

19:32.171 --> 19:34.381
bone's connected to what?

19:34.423 --> 19:35.675
Come on, give it a rest, okay?

19:35.716 --> 19:37.301
They said they

19:35.716 --> 19:37.301
could fix the dinosaur.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.637
And I promised to do

19:37.343 --> 19:39.637
volunteer work at the museum.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.263
For the next ten weekends

19:39.679 --> 19:41.263
in a row, I'm gonna be

19:41.305 --> 19:43.265
combing out the woolly mammoth.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.851
You're lucky they

19:43.307 --> 19:44.851
didn't press charges.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.102
(Danny)

19:44.892 --> 19:46.102
'You know, I asked

19:44.892 --> 19:46.102
you to make sure'

19:46.144 --> 19:47.728
that the kids follow the rules.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.022
But did you listen to me?

19:49.063 --> 19:51.941
No, not you,

19:49.063 --> 19:51.941
not Mr. Fun-boy.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.526
Come on, Mr. Law and order

19:53.567 --> 19:54.861
I was just tryin' to let

19:53.567 --> 19:54.861
the kids have some fun

19:54.902 --> 19:57.030
and, so it got

19:54.902 --> 19:57.030
a little out of hand.

19:57.071 --> 19:58.238
A little out of hand!

19:58.280 --> 19:59.991
Jess, a little

19:58.280 --> 19:59.991
out of hand is cutting

20:00.033 --> 20:02.493
in line at the algae exhibit.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.120
You let the kids

20:02.535 --> 20:04.120
run totally wild.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.746
They knocked over

20:04.162 --> 20:05.746
a priceless dinosaur!

20:05.788 --> 20:07.331
Oh, come on,

20:05.788 --> 20:07.331
it's not priceless.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.415
They said it was

20:07.373 --> 20:08.415
only worth about

20:08.457 --> 20:11.085
like, like $4 million bucks.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.253
When are you gonna

20:11.127 --> 20:13.253
stop trying to be Mr. Cool

20:13.295 --> 20:14.630
and start taking your

20:13.295 --> 20:14.630
responsibilities more seriously?

20:14.672 --> 20:16.256
When are you gonna

20:14.672 --> 20:16.256
get off my back?

20:16.298 --> 20:17.508
I'll get off your back,

20:16.298 --> 20:17.508
when you start acting grown--

20:17.550 --> 20:19.886
Stop it! Stop fighting!

20:19.927 --> 20:23.973
I'm the one who knocked it over,

20:19.927 --> 20:23.973
remember? It's my fault.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.523
Let's go.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.996
Listen, Michelle, what happened

20:44.284 --> 20:46.996
with the dinosaur today

20:47.038 --> 20:48.664
was not your fault.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.876
But I'm the one

20:48.706 --> 20:51.876
who knocked it over.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.252
It was an accident, sweetheart.

20:53.293 --> 20:56.172
A humongous accident.

20:56.214 --> 20:57.798
Yeah, you're right.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.426
But you shouldn't have

20:57.840 --> 21:00.426
been running around.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.178
The reason that

21:00.467 --> 21:02.178
dinosaur got knocked over

21:02.220 --> 21:04.847
is because I was doing

21:02.220 --> 21:04.847
a lousy job of being in charge.

21:04.889 --> 21:07.892
I was trying to be

21:04.889 --> 21:07.892
cool and be loose and, uh..

21:07.934 --> 21:10.352
...wound up messing

21:07.934 --> 21:10.352
everything up. I'm sorry.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.230
I wanted to be

21:10.394 --> 21:12.230
in the fun group

21:12.271 --> 21:13.606
but it was no fun.

21:13.647 --> 21:16.567
I wish I never went

21:13.647 --> 21:16.567
with you, Uncle Jesse.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.405
Hey, wait,

21:19.737 --> 21:21.405
just a second, Michelle.

21:22.949 --> 21:26.285
I want you to take it easy

21:22.949 --> 21:26.285
on your Uncle Jesse.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.746
I've been rough enough

21:26.326 --> 21:28.746
on him for the both of us.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.040
That's okay, Danny.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.040
I deserve it.

21:31.082 --> 21:33.584
No. You-you deserve some of it.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.046
Truth is, I think..

21:37.088 --> 21:39.090
...I think, I was a little

21:37.088 --> 21:39.090
hurt when Michelle chose

21:39.132 --> 21:41.008
to go with your group.

21:41.050 --> 21:44.511
And that's, that's why

21:41.050 --> 21:44.511
I was so hard on you today.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.431
I'm sorry, Jess.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.933
Cool.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.227
Michelle..

21:51.269 --> 21:53.353
...you have to remember how

21:51.269 --> 21:53.353
much you love your Uncle Jesse.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.273
How much fun you have with him.

21:55.355 --> 21:58.234
You might not believe this

21:55.355 --> 21:58.234
but before he moved in with us..

21:58.276 --> 22:00.069
...I used to be a little

21:58.276 --> 22:00.069
on the stiff side.

22:01.279 --> 22:03.572
(Michelle and Jesse)

22:01.279 --> 22:03.572
No!

22:03.614 --> 22:06.117
Yeah, yeah, it's true.

22:06.159 --> 22:09.870
But it took a guy

22:06.159 --> 22:09.870
like your uncle..

22:09.912 --> 22:12.999
...who knew how

22:09.912 --> 22:12.999
to...hang loose.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.668
He taught me how

22:13.040 --> 22:15.668
to bend a little bit.

22:15.709 --> 22:19.005
And, I think it's helped

22:15.709 --> 22:19.005
make me a better father.

22:19.046 --> 22:22.382
Well, your dad taught me what

22:19.046 --> 22:22.382
being a father is all about.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.384
I mean, he maybe a little strict

22:22.424 --> 22:24.384
and he may have a lot of rules

22:24.426 --> 22:27.638
but...I think, it's just

because he cares so much.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.767
Aw, thanks, brother man.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.393
Ain't nothing, brother man.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.941
Now, Michelle, next time you

22:35.771 --> 22:38.941
see me bending a little too much

22:38.983 --> 22:40.442
you let me know, okay?

a little carried away'

22:42.069 --> 22:43.904
and I start making

22:42.069 --> 22:43.904
too many rules

22:43.946 --> 22:45.656
you let me know, too.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.742
Does this mean I'll get

22:45.698 --> 22:48.742
extra bedtime stories?

22:48.784 --> 22:50.661
- Yes.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.661
- No.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.247
- Well, yeah, then.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.247
- No.

Boy, it's hard

22:53.289 --> 22:55.457
