WEBVTT

00:03.960 --> 00:05.680
My name is Detective Sergeant
Emer Berry.

00:05.680 --> 00:07.240
I'm with the
Criminal Assets Bureau.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.440
We'll seize anything we believe
to be the proceeds of crime

00:09.440 --> 00:11.320
or anything purchased
with the proceeds of crime.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.200
Got a scent from the cage.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.200
Diamonds, unpolished.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.520
The documents from the cage
are in Flemish.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.760
They're title deeds
to a property in Antwerp.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.920
I'm guessing this is about the
bombings?

00:23.920 --> 00:27.240
I saw the apartment as a crime scene
and this is CTU.

00:27.240 --> 00:30.760
The suicide bomber who carried out
the attack here in Antwerp,

00:30.760 --> 00:32.400
he stayed in the apartment the
night before.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.200
We also found the body of a woman

00:34.200 --> 00:35.800
who had been murdered in the
bathroom.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.720
Her name is Sana Retz.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.680
She worked for my company
for a short while.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.680
Your guy had a bag full of diamonds

00:41.680 --> 00:43.880
and his apartment was used by
my terrorist.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.360
We need to question him.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.840
We'd like you to present
to the station voluntarily

00:47.840 --> 00:51.040
or if not, we can issue a warrant
for your arrest, up to you.

00:51.040 --> 00:54.080
I'm not taking the rap for anyone,
that clear?

00:54.080 --> 00:55.640
HE GRUNTS

01:21.200 --> 01:25.400
INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER

01:25.400 --> 01:27.280
How long? 40 minutes.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.160
Is that really the best you can do?

01:29.160 --> 01:31.080
Fuck!

01:31.080 --> 01:33.000
Chopper's coming, but it won't
be here for another 40 minutes.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.520
Oh, seriously!

01:34.520 --> 01:36.320
It's coming from Cork.

01:36.320 --> 01:39.480
Any sightings of the bike? Just the
one headed in this direction.

01:41.080 --> 01:44.200
Description's gone out to all units.
Someone's bound to see them.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.840
We can't lose them.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.160
Is this road a dead end?
Where does this road lead?

01:56.320 --> 01:59.560
They've got to be ahead of us
somewhere.Got to be.

01:59.560 --> 02:02.600
Maybe they went off road.
That's why we need the chopper.

02:07.720 --> 02:10.440
Something up ahead, something up
ahead.

02:10.440 --> 02:13.040
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
what was that? What's that?

02:14.200 --> 02:15.760
Back it up, back it up!

02:42.760 --> 02:44.680
RAPID BEEPING

02:44.680 --> 02:45.880
Get down!

02:54.560 --> 02:56.760
It looks like a timer
from a detonator.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.400
Why risk using a detonator?

02:58.400 --> 03:01.040
Couldn't they just set the bike
on fire themselves?

03:01.040 --> 03:03.200
We triggered it.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.800
Must've gone off on foot.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.800
I'll check up here.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.680
This was well planned.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.960
Must have had someone pick them up.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.400
Chief Inspector De Jong?

04:15.400 --> 04:16.840
Yeah.I'm Norah.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.440
Emer said your flight was delayed

04:18.440 --> 04:20.280
and asked me to keep an eye out
for you.

04:20.280 --> 04:22.160
We should go inside. OK.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.840
What happened?

04:29.840 --> 04:34.000
Darren Reid, the man we were
about to question, was shot.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.880
Right here in front of your station?

04:39.320 --> 04:40.440
Yeah.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.280
This way.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.800
Why here? Brexit.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.000
I need a corporate
presence in the EU.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.640
And it had to be Antwerp?

05:11.960 --> 05:13.640
Antwerp's perfect.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.240
Half an hour from the seat of power.

05:15.240 --> 05:19.640
And I get to see my grandson
more often.

05:19.640 --> 05:20.680
Oh, yeah.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.080
Hi.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.680
Sorry I'm late. Hello, darling.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.560
The Port Authority
are now threatening me

05:34.560 --> 05:36.400
with an investigation
and license review.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.600
Well, send over your contract with
them, I'll have my

05:38.600 --> 05:39.800
legal take a look at it.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.400
We did the contracts.
Drew them up myself.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.000
Ah. Well, they're just
trying to cover their asses.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
You know, a lot of hot air
and panic.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.040
Maybe, but if this publicity
continues,

05:49.040 --> 05:51.560
it's going to hit the company hard.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.960
In my experience, you've got to meet
something like this head on.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.760
You can't win a battle in retreat.
Exactly.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.280
You know, if you let accusations

05:59.280 --> 06:01.400
that you hired terrorists go
unchallenged,

06:01.400 --> 06:03.040
it becomes an accepted truth.

06:03.040 --> 06:06.200
It's not good for business,
especially in your line of work.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.640
Well, it's already out there,
what can I do?

06:08.640 --> 06:11.720
Well, you could make
a couple of phone calls.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.480
Try and get your point of view
out there.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.640
What do you mean,
"get it out there"?

06:15.640 --> 06:17.400
Well, newspaper articles,
magazine interviews,

06:17.400 --> 06:20.320
possibly some television,
but that's up to Bibi.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.040
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.320
So, what do you think?

06:26.320 --> 06:27.960
Are you sure it's big enough?

06:27.960 --> 06:30.080
Well, if it's going to be corporate
headquarters in Europe,

06:30.080 --> 06:31.320
it's got to be big.

06:31.320 --> 06:34.200
In that case, it's perfect.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.720
VEHICLE APPROACHES

06:41.840 --> 06:44.640
Go have a nosey. See if
Crime Scene have found anything.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.360
Anyone looking after you?

06:50.360 --> 06:53.080
Yeah. Just waiting on someone
to take my statement.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.600
Can I get you a cup of tea
or something?

06:56.760 --> 06:59.600
No. Thanks.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.840
On his way here,
how did Darren seem to you?

07:03.680 --> 07:05.600
Are you interviewing me now,
Detective?

07:05.600 --> 07:08.360
No, the real police
will investigate the murder.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.200
It's just that I noticed
Darren started running

07:11.200 --> 07:13.240
as soon as he saw the motorbike.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.200
Which seems to me he was nervous,
aware his life was in danger.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.280
Darren Reid is dead.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.240
You're not betraying
client confidentiality

07:22.240 --> 07:24.360
by helping us establish
who killed him.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.600
He was...jumpy.

07:32.760 --> 07:35.680
He had me pick him up
at a car park in town.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.360
Usually, he just meets me
at the station.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.480
Do you think he felt safer
coming here with you?

07:41.600 --> 07:43.120
Possibly.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.520
And on the way here, he did ask

07:47.520 --> 07:50.800
about the possibility
of doing a deal with you lot.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.720
Information for immunity from
prosecution or reduced charge.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.240
He didn't say what information?

08:00.560 --> 08:02.720
No. Sorry.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.360
I've been trying to call you.

08:07.360 --> 08:09.200
Sorry, my phone was on silent.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.240
Gately's inside and
she's looking for you.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.120
Ah, where is she? In the kitchen...

08:14.120 --> 08:15.760
..with Chief Inspector De Jong.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.960
Oh, God. That's all I need.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.240
THEY CHUCKLE

08:28.240 --> 08:30.360
Apologies, Ma'am, I believe
you wanted to see me.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.240
Well, I came for a briefing
on the shooting outside.

08:33.240 --> 08:36.280
But then I discovered you have
a Belgian anti-terrorist officer

08:36.280 --> 08:37.800
hidden away here.

08:37.800 --> 08:42.400
A property we seized the other day
has links to the attacks in Belgium.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.960
I know. Christian
has been filling me in.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.960
And I got a call from
the Chief Commissioner's office.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.600
The Belgians have been
in touch with them.I see.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.800
Would have been nice to have
had a heads-up on all this.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.680
I'm sorry, Ma'am, it was
all very early stages... Hm.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.640
Anyway, the Commissioner
wants you and your team

09:01.640 --> 09:03.600
to assist Christian's
anti-terrorist department

09:03.600 --> 09:05.800
in a joint investigation unit
on this.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.840
Assist? Just make it work, Emer.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.800
Sharing resources
and working together.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.800
Does that mean we can exceed
CAB's investigative remit?

09:14.800 --> 09:17.600
If it's applicable to the
terrorist attacks, yes.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.000
Now, I have to make a statement
to the media

09:20.000 --> 09:21.480
so where are we on this murder?

09:21.480 --> 09:24.040
Darren Reid was under investigation

09:24.040 --> 09:26.320
and on his way here to be
interviewed when he was shot.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.720
It was an extremely professional
killing.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.200
I'd say that there's
a high probability

09:31.200 --> 09:33.800
it's linked to his involvement
in those bombings.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.080
Probably smarter if the
official line on this

09:36.080 --> 09:39.200
is that it was a local gangland
killing.Agreed.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.440
And...

09:41.760 --> 09:44.000
..next time the Commissioner calls,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.360
I don't want to be caught
with my pants down.

09:46.360 --> 09:49.560
That clear, Emer?Yes, Ma'am.

09:49.560 --> 09:51.080
Nice meeting you, Christian.

09:54.840 --> 09:58.200
So, that's official,
you're assisting me.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.160
We work together.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.640
Your witness is dead.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.480
How observant of you.

10:06.320 --> 10:07.600
Come on.

10:14.200 --> 10:17.960
OK. Nice office.It's temporary.

10:20.680 --> 10:24.400
Your unit must be very important,
getting a place like this.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.640
Now that Darren Reid's dead,

10:26.640 --> 10:29.200
it seems you came all the way
out here for no reason.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.600
So I'll have someone book your taxi
to the airport.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.640
cos we're a little busy right now.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.880
Well, I have this for you.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.240
I saw her in your offices.
She's Irish.

10:45.240 --> 10:48.320
Yeah, she is. And she employed
the woman we found murdered

10:48.320 --> 10:49.720
in the bomber's apartment.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.040
An immigrant employed
by an Irish woman

10:54.040 --> 10:56.640
is murdered in the apartment
used by the bomber

10:56.640 --> 10:58.680
and owned by an Irish man.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.200
That's a bit of a coincidence.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.120
Hmm, well...

11:04.800 --> 11:06.640
..I don't believe in coincidences.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.440
Neither do I.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.240
So I thought maybe you could
run a check on her,

11:12.240 --> 11:15.880
see if she has history
or connections to Mr Reid.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.240
Sure. Melnick.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.480
It's not a very Irish name.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.400
Well, that's her married name.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.840
Her father-in-law
is Richard Melnick.

11:24.840 --> 11:27.920
He owns Trestford Ltd,
the Canadian hedge fund company.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.560
He's very rich.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.440
Rich like God, as they say.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.680
Sean, this is
Chief Inspector De Jong.

11:35.680 --> 11:38.960
My colleague, Detective Prendergast.
Hi.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.680
We're going to be working together
on this so if it's about

11:43.680 --> 11:45.320
the investigation, spit it out.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.920
I just spoke to a mate who's on the
team investigating

11:47.920 --> 11:51.440
Darren Reid's murder, and he said
Reid's wife told them

11:51.440 --> 11:53.800
that after we spoke to him
yesterday,

11:53.800 --> 11:56.520
Reid drove off in a panic,
but she doesn't know where.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.640
Have Josh get online access
to Traffic Unit cameras.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.760
See if they can trace Reid's car.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.200
We need to know where he went.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.120
Way ahead of you, he's on it
already.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.000
Do a background check on this woman.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.720
See what turns up. Yes, boss.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.520
You said to your boss you believe
Reid's killing

12:22.520 --> 12:23.760
is linked to this case?

12:23.760 --> 12:26.280
Yeah. How's that?

12:26.280 --> 12:28.680
I was there. That wasn't
a local gangland hit.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.880
These guys were very well trained.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.480
They started shooting from distance
on a moving motorbike

12:33.480 --> 12:35.960
and hit him with the
very first shot.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.920
That's impressive.

12:37.920 --> 12:40.240
Despite being in front
of a police station,

12:40.240 --> 12:43.040
they drove up to Reid and shot him
two more times on the ground.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.680
Sounds like ex-military.It does.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.800
And these suspects, two men?
Yeah.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.920
CAR ENGINE STARTS

12:52.920 --> 12:56.040
A resident on the floor below the
apartment the bomber used

12:56.040 --> 12:58.720
claimed to have seen two men
on the fire escape stairs.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.760
But we can't find them anywhere
or CCTV.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.440
We'll check airports
and ferry manifests

13:05.440 --> 13:09.080
to see if anyone throws up a
red flag. OK.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.920
Well, I'll be flying home tonight.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.200
You'll let me know immediately
if you find anything?

13:13.200 --> 13:17.120
Yeah. And I presume that works both
ways? Of course, yeah.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.360
You're sure this is a good idea?

13:27.360 --> 13:29.320
I can't just do nothing.

13:30.480 --> 13:33.160
While they paint me like some
kind of terrorist sympathiser.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.000
I'd be left without a business.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.160
Or a reputation.

13:41.440 --> 13:42.800
SHE SIGHS

13:42.800 --> 13:45.320
I have to get out ahead of

You look perfect.

DISTANT CHATTER

14:20.720 --> 14:22.760
The news anchor is going to cue me
in, and then,

14:22.760 --> 14:25.600
I'll direct my questions to you.OK.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.960
I'm here today with Bibi Melnick.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.400
Her company employed Sana Retz,

15:02.400 --> 15:04.920
whose body was found in the
apartment used by the

15:04.920 --> 15:08.040
terrorist responsible
for this week's bombing.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.720
Mevrouw Melnick, is it true
that you hired Sana Retz

15:10.720 --> 15:12.600
even though she had no work permit?

15:12.600 --> 15:16.440
Yes, I hired Sana in good faith
after she promised

15:16.440 --> 15:18.280
she would provide us
with her work permits.

15:18.280 --> 15:22.360
But she never did. And still, you
kept on employing her.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.560
We did chase it up with her
a number of times.

15:24.560 --> 15:27.960
Another employee of yours,
Kamal Mersi,

15:27.960 --> 15:29.920
he's also being sought by the police

15:29.920 --> 15:32.760
for questioning in regards
to this investigation.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.080
Yes, I believe that's the case.

15:35.080 --> 15:39.320
Viktor Maes' National Reform Party
issued a statement earlier today

15:39.320 --> 15:42.480
in response to the news that
Sana Retz was an illegal immigrant.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.200
And he's claiming it might be time
for Belgium to close its border.

15:45.200 --> 15:48.280
Yes, I heard his statement and
it didn't surprise me one bit

15:48.280 --> 15:51.240
that Viktor Maes would use
a national tragedy

15:51.240 --> 15:55.200
as an excuse to air his abhorrent
views on race and immigration.

15:55.200 --> 15:58.200
If Viktor Maes were here to defend
himself today, he might claim

15:58.200 --> 16:00.920
that it's not very surprising that
someone who employs and profits

16:00.920 --> 16:02.680
from illegal immigrants would
defend them.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.000
SHE EXHALES SHARPLY

16:04.000 --> 16:06.880
I hired one woman, Sana Retz,

16:06.880 --> 16:09.200
who was an illegal immigrant.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.200
But she was also someone
who was desperate to build

16:12.200 --> 16:14.200
a new life for herself here.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.400
Because the country she was
fleeing was decimated by war.

16:17.400 --> 16:21.040
She was polite and hardworking
and punctual.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.160
And despite the insinuations
of people like Viktor Maes,

16:24.160 --> 16:26.400
there's absolutely no evidence

16:26.400 --> 16:29.160
that Sana had any involvement
with the bombings.

16:29.160 --> 16:31.880
As far as anyone knows,
she was as much a victim

16:31.880 --> 16:33.880
of this atrocity as the others were.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.680
That is true, but nor do we know
that she wasn't involved.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.640
Well, you're forgetting
that Sana was murdered.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.320
The only reason people label her
a terrorist

16:42.320 --> 16:44.760
is because she was a Muslim
and from the Middle East.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.000
Nobody is labelling her a terrorist.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.120
In his statement, Viktor Maes
referred to both Sana and Kamal

16:51.120 --> 16:52.880
as probable terrorists.

16:52.880 --> 16:56.320
Look, his party may call
themselves separatists

16:56.320 --> 17:00.880
or conservatives
or neo-populist or whatever,

17:00.880 --> 17:03.200
but we all know
they're just fig leaves

17:03.200 --> 17:05.280
designed to conceal the truth.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.120
Which is, of course, that Viktor
Maes and his party are racists.

17:08.120 --> 17:10.440
You can't make accusations
like that without substantial...

17:10.440 --> 17:12.240
It's the truth and everybody
knows it.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.480
He and his party and their
supporters are racists.

You're checking up on me?

17:57.520 --> 18:00.600
I just wanted to let you know
that we believe there's another bomb

18:00.600 --> 18:04.000
already in Antwerp. Which means the
next attack is imminent.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.800
Fuck! Yeah.

18:06.880 --> 18:10.160
Anything on the two on the
motorbike?No, nothing.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.360
The forensics here tell me
they have picked up

18:12.360 --> 18:14.920
shoe prints in the apartment
that Darren owned.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.760
I'll check with the lead detective
on Reid's murder

18:17.760 --> 18:19.560
and see if they found anything
similar.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.840
OK, perfect. Stay in touch.
Goodnight.

Sparkling water, Jack, please.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.920
How was Gately?

18:57.920 --> 19:00.000
She didn't look too happy
when she arrived.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.320
Cos I hadn't told her
about the Belgians. Oh...

19:04.320 --> 19:06.800
But mostly, I felt like she was
just holding fire.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.640
Holding for what?
To see how this pans out.

19:09.640 --> 19:12.400
Having a key suspect murdered
in the station car park

19:12.400 --> 19:14.600
is never really a good career move.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.240
She can't blame you for that.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.520
No, but it's our team,
here in Shannon like this.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.720
You do know it's just a trial run?

19:21.720 --> 19:23.960
I kind of figured that
when I saw our offices.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.520
They didn't exactly roll out
the red carpet.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.560
Now with Darren Reid's murder
all over the news and front pages,

19:31.560 --> 19:34.400
we're going to be really
under that microscope.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.080
If we mess up this case now,

19:36.080 --> 19:38.840
Gately will shut us down
and pack us all back to Dublin.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.480
And I always had you pegged
as a city girl.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.760
I thought moving back to Dublin
would be right up your street.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.560
The Dublin bit I don't mind.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.640
It's the failing I can't abide.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.720
Well, let's make sure we don't fail.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.600
Christian called me before I left
the office.

19:55.600 --> 19:59.280
They believe there's
another bomb in Antwerp. Christ!

19:59.280 --> 20:02.560
I'm not saying it's going to
be easy,

20:02.560 --> 20:05.920
but I, for one, am backing us.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.440
You always do.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.600
These are all the names and numbers

20:20.600 --> 20:23.320
the telecom companies identified
from Darren Reid's phone.

20:23.320 --> 20:27.240
Now, we only managed to photograph
the most recent calls he made

20:27.240 --> 20:29.200
before the phone was
completely erased.

20:29.200 --> 20:32.200
So there's every possibility that
whatever he was trying to hide

20:32.200 --> 20:33.880
from us was wiped.

20:33.880 --> 20:37.960
But what we did get was 41 calls
to 11 different numbers.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.320
The first ones are to his friends
and family.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.440
These two are for a car leasing
service he used,

20:43.440 --> 20:45.240
and the Revenue helpline.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.840
HE CHUCKLES

20:46.840 --> 20:48.840
And then, there's these
three numbers here.

20:48.840 --> 20:52.240
One call to a pay-as-you-go,
which we can't trace.

20:52.240 --> 20:55.760
Another four calls to a number
registered to a Jay Ward

20:55.760 --> 20:56.960
who, according to PULSE,

20:56.960 --> 20:59.160
had numerous convictions
for drug offences.

20:59.160 --> 21:02.560
And, it seems, was being supplied
with product by Reid.

21:02.560 --> 21:05.720
And then, there's this
last number here.

21:05.720 --> 21:08.520
And this is a really
interesting one.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.520
Five calls to a Mr Fionn Brannigan,

21:11.520 --> 21:14.920
who happens to be the son
of the late Barry Brannigan.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.080
Who is Barry Brannigan?

21:17.080 --> 21:20.200
You remember the businessman
who went bust owing millions,

21:20.200 --> 21:23.200
ended up killing himself? Vaguely.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.480
Don't you ever watch the news?

21:25.480 --> 21:27.520
I watch the sports.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.600
I had friends in Revenue who worked
on the Brannigan case

21:30.600 --> 21:32.760
and had dealings
with Brannigan Junior.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.840
Oh, I'm sensing
you're not a fan of his.

21:34.840 --> 21:37.680
Pardon my French, but from what I
heard, he's a sneaky little prick.

21:38.600 --> 21:41.600
Does he always look
that pleased with himself?

21:41.600 --> 21:43.600
I believe he does.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.480
Wait!

21:48.480 --> 21:50.240
Wait, who's that in the blue dress?

21:50.240 --> 21:53.200
That's his older sister, Bronagh.

Also known as Bibi.

you asked me to check.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.480
No pleasantries?

22:16.480 --> 22:18.600
No. OK.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.320
Her brother's number was found
on Darren Reid's phone.

22:21.320 --> 22:23.440
Talk about a coincidence.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.600
Hey!

22:45.600 --> 22:48.640
Well done!Did I miss something?

22:48.640 --> 22:50.360
Your interview yesterday.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.320
Ah, it's a bit of a car crash.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.480
No, no, you stood up for Sana.

22:54.480 --> 22:56.520
And it's all over the internet.

22:56.520 --> 22:58.960
You calling Maes and
his looney supporters racists.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.840
Yeah, I'm not sure that's a
good thing.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.480
Screw them. They are racists.

23:16.760 --> 23:19.000
Mr Brannigan?

23:21.160 --> 23:24.080
This is Detective Sergeant Berry
and Detective Prendergast.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.040

23:28.280 --> 23:30.600

if that's all right.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.480
Yeah, of course. Come inside.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.280
HE CHATS INDISTINCTLY

23:45.680 --> 23:49.400
Is this about the shooting
yesterday?In a way, yes.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.200
I saw the street was cordoned off

23:51.200 --> 23:53.400
and they said on the news
someone had been killed.

23:53.400 --> 23:56.640
The victim was a man we were
investigating called Darren Reid.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.400
We have security cameras landside.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.080
They may have picked something up.

24:02.080 --> 24:04.440
You're more than welcome to examine
the footage.Thank you.

24:04.440 --> 24:07.760
We may well do that. But the reason
we're here now is that,

24:07.760 --> 24:10.360
while we were examining
Mr Reid's phone, we discovered

24:10.360 --> 24:11.520
a number of calls to you.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.080
Yes.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.480
Why was Darren Reid calling you?

24:16.480 --> 24:19.120
I assume you already know that
Mr Reid was involved

24:19.120 --> 24:21.360
in the illicit drug business.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.800
Hm, that's one way of putting it.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.640
And I'm not admitting to anything,

24:24.640 --> 24:26.800
but I'm sure there were lots
of people in contact with Darren

24:26.800 --> 24:29.280
to purchase small amounts
of cocaine

24:29.280 --> 24:31.360
for their own personal use.

24:31.360 --> 24:35.360
What puzzles me is how you would
know someone like Darren Reid.

24:35.360 --> 24:38.520
I can't see you and him
socialising in the same circles.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.400
We were members of the same gym.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.280
I'd see him in the changing rooms.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.840
I guess we got chatting
and one thing led to another.

24:44.840 --> 24:48.080
You have a sister in Antwerp,
is that right?

24:48.080 --> 24:50.960
Yes.Did she know Darren Reid too?

24:50.960 --> 24:53.840
No. How would she? WHY would she?

24:53.840 --> 24:58.320
I don't know, maybe you introduced
them. No. I didn't.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.440
And Bibi hasn't been here for years.

25:00.440 --> 25:04.000
So, no, she doesn't know him.
I'm certain of that.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.480
It's just that an employee
of your sister's was found dead

25:06.480 --> 25:09.440
in an apartment in Antwerp that
appeared to be owned by Reid.

25:09.440 --> 25:13.080
It's quite a coincidence,
wouldn't you think? I don't know.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.720
Yes, I suppose it is.

25:14.720 --> 25:17.360
I mean, Darren Reid owns
this apartment.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.080
Your sister's employee was found
dead in it

25:19.080 --> 25:21.120
and your number is on his phone.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.280
I told you already.
I bought cocaine from Darren.

25:23.280 --> 25:25.160
Small amounts, that's all.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.520
And I'm absolutely certain Bibi
doesn't know him

25:27.520 --> 25:29.880
and I have no idea how
her employee ended up there.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.200
OK...

25:33.200 --> 25:37.400
And this gym you and Darren Reid
are members of, what's it called?

25:37.400 --> 25:40.360
Titanic Fitness.
Do I need my lawyer here?

25:40.360 --> 25:42.280
Not right now,

25:42.280 --> 25:44.320
but I would put him on notice.

25:51.160 --> 25:53.840
Aviation services.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.880
What exactly is that?

25:55.880 --> 25:58.480
Basically, I trade in aircraft.

25:58.480 --> 26:01.080
Buying them, leasing them,
selling them.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.040
Do you operate planes of your own?

26:04.040 --> 26:07.680
Yes, sometimes, but not normally.

26:07.680 --> 26:11.440
Did you have any planes flying
in and out of Ireland yesterday?

26:11.440 --> 26:12.920
No.

26:12.920 --> 26:16.320
And I presume you have documentation
to verify that?

26:16.320 --> 26:18.800
Yes, absolutely.

26:18.800 --> 26:22.040
If you make an official request,
I can provide it.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.800
Great. I'll do that.

27:11.680 --> 27:14.760
That won't be necessary.
Come this way.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.440
Do you know this man?

27:20.680 --> 27:23.560
No. His name is Darren Reid.

27:23.560 --> 27:27.280
You asked me about that name before.
I don't know him. Who is he?

27:27.280 --> 27:29.360
He's an Irish drug dealer.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.440
And we found your brother's number
on his phone.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.560
What's that got to do with me?

27:34.560 --> 27:36.720
Well, Darren Reid also owned
the apartment

27:36.720 --> 27:38.520
where Sana's body was found.

27:38.520 --> 27:41.520
An apartment that's also been used
by a terrorist.

27:43.320 --> 27:44.840
SHE EXHALES SHARPLY

27:50.480 --> 27:51.960
SHE EXHALES DEEPLY

27:53.280 --> 27:54.760
My brother...

27:56.720 --> 27:59.080
My brother is the reason that
I haven't been home in Ireland

27:59.080 --> 28:00.440
in over five years.

28:01.600 --> 28:04.840
He's the reason that I changed
my name when I got married.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.280
My dad took Fionn into the
family business

28:08.280 --> 28:12.680
that he had spent 40 years building
up and Fionn...

28:14.720 --> 28:16.960
..brought the whole thing
crashing down.

28:18.440 --> 28:20.640
And everyone went after my dad.

28:20.640 --> 28:23.480
Revenue, creditors, banks,

28:23.480 --> 28:26.480
media, especially.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.280
And he killed himself.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.760
After that, our family name
was destroyed.

28:35.760 --> 28:37.520
It became a byword for scandal
in Ireland.

28:37.520 --> 28:39.920
You can look it up,
it's all over the internet.

28:39.920 --> 28:42.280
And I have been trying to escape
from it for years.

28:42.280 --> 28:46.320
But Fionn always finds a way
of dragging me back into his shit.

28:46.320 --> 28:50.520
Look, I have no idea what my brother
and this drug dealer were doing.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.640
I have no idea how Sana ended up
in that apartment,

28:52.640 --> 28:54.640
but you need to speak to Fionn.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.080
You have any idea
if your brother knew Sana?

28:58.080 --> 28:59.840
No, how could he?

28:59.840 --> 29:02.440
There is this other thing
that bothers us.

29:02.440 --> 29:06.360
The address you gave for Sana,
that doesn't exist. It's fake.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.960
Well, that's the only one
she gave us. Hm.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.640
And what about Kamal Mersi?

29:11.640 --> 29:13.840
Another of your employees we
need to speak to. He vanished.

29:15.080 --> 29:17.960
All these things seem to lead
back to you.

29:17.960 --> 29:20.080
Hold on a minute.

29:20.080 --> 29:23.040
Josef, can you come here, please?

29:28.040 --> 29:31.120
Josef, you gave Kamal and Sana
lifts home after work, yes?

29:31.120 --> 29:33.360
Yes, sometimes.
So you know where Sana lived?

29:33.360 --> 29:35.720
No, never to her house.

29:35.720 --> 29:39.880
But she always asked me to
drop her off to the same street.

29:39.880 --> 29:43.040
Can you please show these police
officers where that street is?

29:43.040 --> 29:44.400
Yes.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.800
Ideally, I'd like a Section 6
search and seize

29:50.800 --> 29:52.440
to really go after Brannigan.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.440
What do we have?
He's on Reid's phone.

29:54.440 --> 29:56.320
But he's explained they were
members of the same gym

29:56.320 --> 29:58.360
and he bought drugs from him.

29:58.360 --> 30:01.680
That's IF they were members
of the same gym. They were.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.520
Fionn Brannigan has been a member
of Titanic Fitness for 18 months.

30:04.520 --> 30:06.600
And Darren Reid even longer,
almost five years.

30:08.360 --> 30:10.240
What about the woman
who worked for his sister?

30:10.240 --> 30:11.920
She was found dead
in Reid's apartment.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.960
That ties him in there, too.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.080
Not in the eyes of the law,

30:15.080 --> 30:17.160
unless you can link him directly
to the woman.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.160
Look, if we applied
with what you've got now,

30:19.160 --> 30:20.920
the judge will cite coincidence

30:20.920 --> 30:23.320
and say we don't have a case
that's strong enough to justify

30:23.320 --> 30:25.440
the level of intrusion
that Section 6 entails.

30:25.440 --> 30:29.120
We need more.Fine. Get an order
to access his bank accounts

30:29.120 --> 30:30.840
and see what that throws up.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.480
I'll put the application
together,

30:32.480 --> 30:34.640
but I'm not sure
we even have enough for that.

30:34.640 --> 30:37.360
Sean, I want you to focus
on Fionn Brannigan's tax returns

30:37.360 --> 30:39.160
and online presence.

30:39.160 --> 30:42.040
See if his income matches his
lifestyle. On it.

30:42.040 --> 30:45.200
Any progress on where Reid went
yesterday after we spoke to him?

30:45.200 --> 30:47.720
So far, I've found his car
on three cameras.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.560
So I know he was heading west
and in an hurry.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.760
Great. Now, keep at it.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.840
You sure? You sure it is
where you left her?

31:05.840 --> 31:07.520
Yes, I'm sure.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.400
What direction did she go
after she got out of the car?

31:11.400 --> 31:15.000
I don't know. She waved
and I drove away. That's it.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.160
Thank you.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.160
INAUDIBLE SPEECH

32:02.760 --> 32:05.240
INAUDIBLE SPEECH

32:05.240 --> 32:07.160
OK. Thank you.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.480
Can I help you?

32:25.480 --> 32:27.720
Chief Inspector De Jong,
Counter-Terrorist unit.

32:27.720 --> 32:29.040
This is Inspector Thijs.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.160
What is this place?

32:32.160 --> 32:33.880
We provide temporary housing units

32:33.880 --> 32:35.800
for women who have been
granted asylum.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.240
Do you know this woman?

32:42.680 --> 32:44.600
I have to warn you,
aiding a terrorist operation

32:44.600 --> 32:46.400
is a very serious offence.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.440
Yes, I know her.

32:56.520 --> 32:58.600
Is there another exit
to this building?

32:58.600 --> 33:01.040
There's a back door through there.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.760
I suggest you tell me what you know.

33:10.760 --> 33:12.880
There are a lot of lives
at stake here.

33:16.240 --> 33:19.040
Yes. Sana lived here.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.720
Sana lived here.Mm-hm. OK.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.320
I was just chatting with the lads
outside at the crime scene.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.800
And this isn't official until
they get the ballistics report,

33:37.800 --> 33:40.680
but they reckoned the bullet casings
used were from a Glock.

33:40.680 --> 33:43.480
It's gangland.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.880
What we saw out there
was not local.

33:45.880 --> 33:48.040
They were highly trained.
Check the airports.

33:48.040 --> 33:49.520
I went through the passenger lists,

33:49.520 --> 33:51.600
but no-one's throwing up
any red flags yet.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.480
I would look at the private
and charter jets.

33:53.480 --> 33:56.000
Especially anything linked
to Fionn Brannigan

33:56.000 --> 33:57.480
and his air service companies.

33:57.480 --> 34:00.560
Will do.
I think I might have something here.

34:03.160 --> 34:05.200
So, I've been able to trace
Darren Reid's journey

34:05.200 --> 34:07.640
after you spoke to him
across five cameras.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.360
And this is the fifth one.

34:11.960 --> 34:15.760
See? That's Darren Reid's car
there...

34:15.760 --> 34:18.800
..and it turns right.

34:18.800 --> 34:21.320
And here he is again,

34:21.320 --> 34:24.280
coming back less than
seven minutes later.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.880
Do you know what's in there?

34:25.880 --> 34:27.800
Do you have any idea
where he was going?

34:27.800 --> 34:29.480
Yeah, I checked on Google Maps.

34:29.480 --> 34:33.200
It's a pub called
the Crossroads Tavern.Good work.

Thank you, Louise.Enjoy!

36:02.200 --> 36:04.920
Hi!Hi. You're late.

36:04.920 --> 36:08.160
Sorry, it was just one of
those days.

36:08.160 --> 36:11.920
So, are you excited about
your big day tomorrow?

36:11.920 --> 36:13.760
It's not that big a day.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.240
Just think about the money
you'll be raking it.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.200
Jesus, Fionn, it's not about that.

36:18.200 --> 36:20.840
Oh, yeah. They talk
about all that God stuff.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.240
But me and Holly know, don't we?

36:33.360 --> 36:35.640
She might be calling to wish
Holly good luck.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.960
Yeah, I'll call Bibi later,
she can do it then.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.360
Let's order. What do we feel like?

36:45.560 --> 36:47.520
Fionn. Are you OK?

36:47.520 --> 36:51.680
Yeah, yeah. I told you, it's been
more of a shitty day. That's all.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.080
Actually, I need to go
to the toilet.

36:57.080 --> 36:59.040
You said you wanted to order.

36:59.040 --> 37:01.520
Yeah, I'll have the steak.
The big one. Medium rare.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.480

38:52.560 --> 38:55.360
Sorry I missed dinner. That's OK.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.280
What happened?

38:59.800 --> 39:01.120
I need a drink.

39:04.680 --> 39:06.200
What did the police say?

39:07.800 --> 39:11.440
Well, the apartment
that Sana was found in

39:11.440 --> 39:14.400
was owned by an Irish drug dealer.

39:14.400 --> 39:17.680
And Fionn's number was
on the drug dealer's phone.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.440
How can that be?

39:19.440 --> 39:22.600
I presume Fionn
was buying drugs off him?

39:22.600 --> 39:24.720
That doesn't explain Sana
being there.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.360
Did you call him?

39:26.360 --> 39:29.400
I've been calling him all
afternoon. He won't answer.

39:29.400 --> 39:33.400
If he drags us into another one of
his messes, I will kill him.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.360
This is a bit more than his
usual shit.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.480
You sure there hasn't been a
mistake?

39:39.480 --> 39:42.360
They seemed pretty certain to me.

39:42.360 --> 39:45.640
If this gets out on top of all the
publicity about Sana and Kamal,

39:45.640 --> 39:48.680
the business is gone,
I won't survive it.

39:50.440 --> 39:52.440
We'll apply for media blackout.

39:52.440 --> 39:54.280
That just makes me look like
I've got something to hide.

39:54.280 --> 39:56.800
It's just until the police
can establish the truth.

39:56.800 --> 39:59.800
You don't need your reputation
tarnished by Fionn again.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.840
Shall we talk to your dad?

40:04.840 --> 40:06.480
See what he says?

40:07.520 --> 40:08.800
No.

40:11.880 --> 40:13.400
I can handle this.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.120
OK?

40:17.120 --> 40:18.720
OK.

40:20.240 --> 40:23.400
I'm going to call Sebastian.
Media law is his area.

40:23.400 --> 40:25.000
He'll know what to do.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.440
SHE GASPS

40:39.440 --> 40:41.000
James!

40:45.120 --> 40:48.160
Oh, my God! Don't move.

40:48.160 --> 40:51.160
Arthur, stay where you are!
Do not come any closer.

40:51.160 --> 40:52.800
Chesa!

40:52.800 --> 40:54.880
Yes, Mevrouw Melnick?

40:54.880 --> 40:56.680
Could you please take Arthur
to his room?

40:59.520 --> 41:02.320
Don't move. I'll call an ambulance.

41:02.320 --> 41:05.640
It doesn't sting. It doesn't burn.

41:07.040 --> 41:09.760
If it was anthrax,
I'd be blistering, wouldn't I?

41:09.760 --> 41:12.800
I don't... We don't know what
it is. Let's get a doctor.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.440
Be careful, be careful!

41:15.400 --> 41:17.240
It's talcum powder.

41:17.240 --> 41:19.320
It's fucking talcum powder.

41:20.880 --> 41:22.720
SHE EXHALES SHARPLY

41:29.520 --> 41:32.760
I understand Sana was your friend
and you were just trying to help

41:32.760 --> 41:34.560
by allowing her to stay here
with you.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.800
But, actually, I don't care
about any of that.

41:36.800 --> 41:39.000
As long as you answer
my questions honestly.

41:40.320 --> 41:42.080
Was Sana radicalised?

41:42.080 --> 41:43.640
No.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.200
You're sure?

41:45.200 --> 41:48.080
Sana had no anger.

41:48.080 --> 41:51.000
None. About anything.

41:52.720 --> 41:55.080
She was a happy
and positive person.

41:55.080 --> 41:59.240
Then, how did she end up dead
in an apartment used by a terrorist?

41:59.240 --> 42:02.760
I have no idea. That's not her.

42:02.760 --> 42:07.200
Did she have friends or other people
she met up with outside this unit?

42:07.200 --> 42:09.600
Just at work, Kamal.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.120
Kamal?

42:11.120 --> 42:12.640
Kamal Mersi?

42:12.640 --> 42:16.320
Yes. He and his friend
came here to visit Sana.

42:16.320 --> 42:19.680
What friend? I don't know.

42:19.680 --> 42:22.280
Sana just said that
he was Kamal's friend.

42:22.280 --> 42:25.600
If they came to visit Sana,
they would have had to sign in.

42:25.600 --> 42:27.120
And you'll have a record of that.

42:28.440 --> 42:30.720
Get it for me, please.Of course.

42:32.600 --> 42:36.760
Was Sana in a romantic
relationship with this Kamal?

42:36.760 --> 42:38.440
No.

42:38.440 --> 42:39.760
But it's...

42:40.800 --> 42:42.840
..it's what she hoped would happen.

42:42.840 --> 42:46.040
They usually met for a coffee
or a film.

42:46.040 --> 42:48.320
And this friend, he went with them?

42:48.320 --> 42:50.280
Yes, sometimes.

42:51.320 --> 42:54.880
The friend who came to visit with
Kamal is named Hadi Mansour.

42:54.880 --> 42:56.920
OK. Hadi Mansour.

43:01.720 --> 43:03.840
OK. Thank you very much.

43:08.560 --> 43:11.680
It's got to be one of Maes'
nut job supporters.

43:13.600 --> 43:15.560
We call the police?No, please.

43:15.560 --> 43:18.160
I can't bear another police
questioning now.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.280
You're the victim here.

43:20.280 --> 43:22.760
Look, it was just some crackpot
trying to scare us.

43:22.760 --> 43:25.720
Well, they succeeded.
Look, I'm fine.

43:25.720 --> 43:27.280
I wasn't hurt. Nobody was hurt.

43:28.400 --> 43:31.120
I don't want to give Viktor Maes
fanatics any more attention

43:31.120 --> 43:32.280
than they already have.

43:34.200 --> 43:35.960
I'll hire security for the house.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.680
No. Look...

43:39.920 --> 43:41.880
..James, there's really no need.

43:41.880 --> 43:46.240
It was just a stupid prank. OK?

44:26.400 --> 44:28.560
What can I get you?

44:28.560 --> 44:30.880
Is the owner around?

44:30.880 --> 44:32.480
What's this about?

44:32.480 --> 44:33.960
We want to talk to the owner.

44:37.360 --> 44:39.920
If he's not here, you can
just give us his number.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.400
Jim!

44:51.960 --> 44:54.040
Something wrong?

44:54.040 --> 44:56.800
We'd like to talk to you
about your security system.

45:16.680 --> 45:18.280
You want to explain that?

45:20.840 --> 45:24.240
Sometimes, Darren would pay me
to use the phone back here.

45:24.240 --> 45:27.000
Why would he do that?
I don't know.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.200
So people don't know
who he's ringing, I suppose.

45:32.240 --> 45:35.280
Do you have a log of numbers called?

45:35.280 --> 45:37.600
It should be in our online account.

45:39.400 --> 45:41.600
I want to find out
who he called from here.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.200
What time exactly was it?

45:43.200 --> 45:45.760
8:37, Wednesday evening.

45:48.960 --> 45:50.440
There it is.

45:54.280 --> 45:56.040
Run a check on that.

46:05.680 --> 46:07.000
You're fired.

46:10.720 --> 46:12.280
Thank you, Josh!

46:12.280 --> 46:14.520
You're not going to believe this.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.000
That's Fionn Brannigan's mobile.

46:17.160 --> 46:19.800
Tell Norah to get us a search
and seize.

46:19.800 --> 46:22.240
We have him. On it.

47:17.120 --> 47:18.760
SIREN BEEPS

47:26.640 --> 47:28.040
Yeah.

47:46.760 --> 47:49.200
ENGINE STARTS

47:49.200 --> 47:52.080
SIREN WAILS

48:08.360 --> 48:09.840
Fuck!
