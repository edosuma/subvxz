Dispatch, this is Aid 19.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.390
We're about two minutes out
from Grey-Sloan

00:22.423 --> 00:24.592
with an unresponsive
20-year-old in the back

00:24.625 --> 00:26.594
who just went into
cardiac arrest.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.431
That's the platform.
Mayor, what's up?

00:30.464 --> 00:32.266
Hey, good to see you guys.
Let me grab you a beer.

00:32.300 --> 00:35.035
Theo: Oh, come on, fake burglar
Santa stuck in the chimney

00:35.069 --> 00:36.837
was the best call
that house ever saw.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.339
You know who's never seen
a call like that? Dixon.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.208
Man:
Yeah, he got my vote.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.575
Right, sure, but is Dixon
the guy you'd want with you

00:41.609 --> 00:43.444
in a five-alarm fire?
Just think about it.

00:43.477 --> 00:44.745
-But he helped me out, so --
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.447
No, no, I-I get it.
Dixon promoted you.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.015
Yeah, yeah.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.050
Well, hey,
enjoy the beer.
So...

00:50.084 --> 00:51.219
Alright, man.
Thank you.

Okay.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.977
Thanks. I will
absolutely let him know.

Herrera,
Happy Halloween.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.981
You're chipper.

02:28.015 --> 02:30.384
And early.
It's Halloween.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.320
The tricks, the treats.
Who doesn't love it?

02:32.353 --> 02:34.522
Yeah. I'm not used to you
being so cheerful.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.790
It's kinda creeping me out.
Just this one holiday.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.459
I'll switch back tomorrow,
I promise.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.027
Vic: I think they thought
some of it was interesting.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.162
They only talked to me
when I was buying them beer.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.631
Okay, they're
off-duty firefighters.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.633
What did you expect?
I bought so much beer

02:45.666 --> 02:47.835
that my bank thought
my card had been stolen.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.570
And I don't think I convinced
anyone that I'm their candidate.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.804
Oh, come on.
It wasn't that bad.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.806
It wasn't that bad?

02:52.840 --> 02:54.975
"Dixon helped me promote."
"Dixon's a good chief."
Oh.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.710
Okay, here, that's two.
"He's not all PC and that crap."

02:56.744 --> 02:57.978
That's two, two dollars.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.147
Two dollars, come on.
Come on.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.549
This is extortion.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.751
You are doing this to yourself,
okay?

03:03.784 --> 03:06.520
What --
We're charging him every time
he complains about Dixon.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.189
And at this rate, he has fully
funded his own campaign.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.658
How -- How was it
really?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.693
It was gross.
It was bad.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.428
[ Gasps ]
Not good. Terrible.
Disaster.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.763
And I got hit on a lot,
so...
Oh.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.865
Yeah, it was bad.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.233
Oh, hello.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.901
Are we late, or...?

03:20.934 --> 03:22.270
If you're on time,
you're late.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.004
And if you're early,
you're on time.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.839
And you were so early
you're leaving?

03:25.873 --> 03:27.375
Yeah, I just worked
the last shift with Bishop,

03:27.408 --> 03:29.877
and now I have
a romantic weekend

03:29.910 --> 03:32.079
planned with
my new lady friend.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.448
I'm sorry. You met somebody
on the Internet?

03:34.482 --> 03:36.450
Milkmaid47.
What?

03:36.484 --> 03:37.718
-Hey, hey, what?
-That's really her handle?

03:37.751 --> 03:39.086
Oh, okay.
Look, her name is Alana.

03:39.119 --> 03:41.054
She's smart, she's funny.
Mm.

03:41.088 --> 03:44.057
And, yes, her handle is...
Milkmaid.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.694
-Gross.
-Well, that sounds promising.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.429
What? Come on.
Oh, oh.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.464
And she lives in Oregon,
so I gotta get on the road.

03:50.498 --> 03:51.965
Wish me luck.
Uh, that seems like a long way

03:51.999 --> 03:53.634
to drive for a first date.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.470
You know what?
I have a feeling she's worth it.

03:56.504 --> 04:00.040
Oh. Ugh.
Here you go.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.110
You know I was the only woman
from FD in the bar last night?

04:03.143 --> 04:05.078
Oh.
Yeah, I thought that was weird.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.647
Well, half the department
was there

04:06.680 --> 04:08.582
because we advertised free beer,
and I was the only one.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.384
I wish I was surprised.

04:10.418 --> 04:13.321
I mean, women only make up,
like, what, 7% of SFD?

04:13.354 --> 04:15.289
Ben: I know the program
is finding its feet,

04:15.323 --> 04:16.990
but this is important, too.
Alright?

04:17.024 --> 04:19.126
Get this.
No, no, I can't.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.894
Fine. O-Okay.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.331
I-I said, "Okay."
Okay? Bye.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.732
-Whew.
-Ruh-roh.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.467
Who peed in your cereal?

04:26.500 --> 04:28.736
Come on. Tell us.
Was it Dixon?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.671
-Oh, um, Miranda.
-We didn't even get that one.

04:30.704 --> 04:34.174
Yeah. Miranda has
back-to-back surgeries,

04:34.207 --> 04:36.009
so she won't be bringing Pru
for trick-or-treating.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.578
-What?
-No!

04:37.611 --> 04:40.113
She needs to be here.
We need to see her costume.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.915
It's what the people need,
Warren.
Yeah.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.651
Okay. If you would let me
finish,

04:43.684 --> 04:44.685
Joey will be bringing her.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.186
-Oh.
-Oh.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.788
Theo: So it's all fine?
No crisis?

04:47.821 --> 04:49.657
Yeah, well, it would've been
nice if Miranda would bring her.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.360
I mean, this is our first
Halloween with Pru,

04:52.393 --> 04:53.661
and it's not like
I can request time off,

04:53.694 --> 04:55.195
and Miranda chose to work.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.930
No, no, no, Warren.
Hold on. Stop.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.532
You sat here for months
complaining

04:58.566 --> 05:00.100
that you were worried about
Bailey quitting,

05:00.133 --> 05:02.336
and now she finally found
the -- the passion, the joy,

05:02.370 --> 05:04.104
and the reward
in her job again,

05:04.137 --> 05:05.606
so don't you dare
diminish that

05:05.639 --> 05:07.140
just because it's not
what you want it to be.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.642
Okay, Dr. Miranda Bailey

05:08.676 --> 05:11.379
is a badass surgeon,
and those patients are lucky

05:11.412 --> 05:12.946
that she's choosing
to save their lives today.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.147
Okay?
-Mm.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.650
Okay.

05:16.684 --> 05:17.951
Maybe you should be
running for mayor.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.520
Well, I'm not gonna lie,
I've thought about it.

05:19.553 --> 05:22.656
Okay, so, uh,
who wants to see

05:22.690 --> 05:23.791
pictures of Pru
in her Halloween costume?

05:23.824 --> 05:24.992
-Yes!
-Yeah!

05:25.025 --> 05:26.460
-Of course we do.
-Obviously.

05:26.494 --> 05:27.961
Boom.
Right? Come on.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.464
Aww.
QuÃ© preciosa!

05:30.498 --> 05:32.065
I mean, I tried to beg, but they
wouldn't let me make costumes...
It's so cute!

05:32.099 --> 05:33.834
...anymore,
but look at her, right?
You made that?

-Why would you --
-Ahh!

05:39.206 --> 05:40.841
Man: Oh.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.243
Line up in 10!

05:43.276 --> 05:45.646
Dixon promoted that,
okay?

05:45.679 --> 05:46.814
That is
what I'm up against.
Man: Cha-ching!

05:46.847 --> 05:48.582
-Oh.
-Worth it.

05:48.616 --> 05:49.550
-Cough it up.
-Give it to him.

Okay.

Tonight, we'll be opening
our doors to the community

05:54.021 --> 05:55.556
for our annual
trick-or-treating event.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.025
I expect you all to be helpful,
to be cheerful,

05:58.058 --> 05:59.760
and to put
a little bit of love,

05:59.793 --> 06:03.497
a little bit of your heart into
decorating this place today.

06:03.531 --> 06:06.333
But given the unique spirit
of this holiday,

06:06.366 --> 06:09.537
today is also about
having a bit of fun.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.347
What? Come on, people!
I got you good!

06:20.380 --> 06:21.882
Captain, you started a prank war
with the wrong guy.

06:21.915 --> 06:22.916
Bring it, Warren!

06:22.950 --> 06:25.419
Happy Halloween, 19.

06:25.453 --> 06:28.088
I-I think he meant to hit
all of us.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.023
Yeah. But you might want
to take a shower.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.459
'Cause the blond is...

06:31.492 --> 06:33.093
not so blond.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.730
Can we do anything?
Nothing legal.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.365
There are a lot of paramedics
and a doctor here,

06:38.398 --> 06:41.134
so if you want to make it
look like an accident...

06:41.168 --> 06:42.636

I-I got you, Bishop.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.539

but I got you.
