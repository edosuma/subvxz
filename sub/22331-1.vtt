00:05.600 --> 00:08.700
News of a bizarre,
chainsaw-wielding family...

00:09.100 --> 00:12.900
...reports which were to ignite
the world's imagination...

00:13.300 --> 00:16.400
...began to filter out
of central Texas.

00:16.900 --> 00:21.200
Regrettably, not one of the family
members was ever apprehended...

00:21.700 --> 00:25.600
...and for more than 10 years,
nothing further was heard.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.900
Then over the next several years...

00:29.300 --> 00:34.100
...at least two minor, yet apparently
related incidents, were reported.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.700
Then again nothing.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.900
It's not clear how the shooting spree
was motivated...

02:11.800 --> 02:14.700
...although there has been
widespread speculation...

02:15.200 --> 02:17.900
...it was in retaliation for the bomb
threats in Hebron.

02:18.400 --> 02:23.100
A jury ruled guilty in the slaying
of abortion doctor Irwin Guthrie.

02:23.700 --> 02:26.400
It took the 7-man,
5-woman jury just hours...

02:26.800 --> 02:28.300
...to find Norris guilty...

02:49.500 --> 02:52.200
Hey, I think you're chasing
the wrong tail.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.300
Where have you been?!

02:54.700 --> 02:57.400
The wedding's going on.
You go on the top tier.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.800
Don't mind the footprints
in the icing.

03:00.200 --> 03:04.000
They look good. It's like a vest
thing. I fucking hate kids.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.500
Miss Abbott,
did Barry come through here?

03:14.300 --> 03:16.400
Oh, Barry?

03:16.800 --> 03:18.100
Didn't you break up?

03:18.500 --> 03:19.400
No.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.700
Well, never mind. I just thought...

03:23.400 --> 03:24.600
Forget it.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.500
She's doing it again.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.300
Miss Abbott, she's...

03:33.700 --> 03:37.500
She just does that to make trouble.
It is so obvious.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.600
What are you talking about?

03:40.200 --> 03:43.200
Don't listen to her.
She's trying to make trouble.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.300
She's such a bitch.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.500
Sean, hi.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.500
Have you seen Barry?

03:55.200 --> 03:56.900
Not in a while. Have you?

03:57.800 --> 03:59.700
- She was completely naked.
- Bullshit.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.500
She was spilling all over the place,
like a battleship.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.100
- A battleship?
- Okay, like a dinghy.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.200
Has anybody seen Barry?

04:19.600 --> 04:21.300
You've seen Barry?

04:31.300 --> 04:32.400
Oh, shit!

04:37.400 --> 04:39.500
Don't worry. She'll be back.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.700
If that's really what you want.

04:55.900 --> 04:56.700
Stop!

04:58.000 --> 04:59.900
Heather, stop the car!

05:05.300 --> 05:06.200
Damn it!

05:07.400 --> 05:10.000
You better fucking stop this car
right now!

05:10.800 --> 05:12.600
We have a wreck, it'll be my ass!

05:13.000 --> 05:14.500
- I don't care.
- Slow down.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.900
I wasn't doing anything.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.200
I saw you. You were kissing her.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.900
Once! What's wrong with that?

05:22.400 --> 05:25.100
I can't even talk to my friends.
You're so possessive.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.800
That's why you were feeling her up.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.500
Guys need sex. It's bad to be excited
and not get it.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.200
You can get prostate cancer.
You want that?

05:34.600 --> 05:35.900
That's a lie.

05:37.000 --> 05:37.700
Look out!

05:42.700 --> 05:43.700
Fuck!

05:47.600 --> 05:49.300
What's the matter with you?

05:49.700 --> 05:51.800
I'm so fucking dead right now!

05:52.300 --> 05:53.800
Oh, man.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.500
You can't get cancer
from not having sex.

05:56.900 --> 06:00.600
Like you'd know. You never
had a date, you're so ugly.

06:01.000 --> 06:01.800
She is not.

06:02.200 --> 06:02.900
Shut up.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.400
He wants you to think it's your fault.

06:05.800 --> 06:09.600
My father's a doctor. I know what
I'm talking about, so fuck you.

06:10.100 --> 06:13.200
It's true, it is my fault.
I won't have sex with him.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.300
It doesn't make it your fault.

06:15.600 --> 06:20.400
What if he gets cancer and his hair
falls out from the drugs? Could happen.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.800
So just shut up, all right?

06:23.100 --> 06:26.200
It's a line to get you
to have sex with him. Ask Sean.

06:26.700 --> 06:27.600
She's right.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.500
He's never had a hard-on.

06:29.900 --> 06:33.100
- I know his lines. We were neighbours.
- Shut up.

06:33.600 --> 06:37.000
We were friends before he got too cool.
So fucking annoying.

06:37.300 --> 06:39.700
It's not my fault you turned out
to be a geek.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.800
He used to come to my house and laugh
about the girls he felt up.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.200
He told them his father was a doctor...

06:47.600 --> 06:50.500
...and they'd get breast cancer
if they weren't felt up.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.300
It's not my fault they're
stupid enough to believe it.

06:54.700 --> 06:55.600
What a schmuck.

06:56.000 --> 06:56.800
What's your problem?

06:57.400 --> 06:59.200
Just because you hate guys.

06:59.700 --> 07:02.200
He's just trying
to change the subject.

07:03.300 --> 07:06.400
What are you afraid of?
That they might try to fuck you?

07:07.000 --> 07:07.700
No.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.200
It's no secret.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.400
What?

07:10.900 --> 07:11.800
Ask anybody.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.300
You never go anywhere
unless you're with Sean.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.600
Everybody knows he's a pothead
and you're only friends.

07:27.600 --> 07:31.400
What if we crashed into a car in front
of us and we all died?

11:03.300 --> 11:07.600
I dreamt about a weirdo following me
through the woods, and it's coming true.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.700
I'm sorry, but we're all gonna die.

11:11.100 --> 11:11.900
Some murderer...

11:16.100 --> 11:17.000
...will kill us.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.200
Now we can't see.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.100
Someone is following me.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.800
I can feel their eyes on me.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.000
Bullshit!

11:35.200 --> 11:38.000
They want us to wander around
in the dark.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.900
We need an ambulance.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.500
Piece of shit.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.400
You might be, but my father's
still gonna kill me.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.400
Call the police. There's been
an accident. A man's dying.

12:10.900 --> 12:11.900
Prom night.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.300
Somebody bring me a glass of water.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.900
I think I'm gonna pass out.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.800
Damn answering machine.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.600
Don't worry, he'll pick up.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.100
Vilmer, if you're there, babe,
pick up the phone.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.800
Phony as 3-dollar bills.
Changed my life, though.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.500
Goddamn it, button it up, babe.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.500
- Glass of water?
- Stop it!

12:41.800 --> 12:42.800
You know what?

12:43.200 --> 12:46.300
The minute I showed up with these,
every farmer in the county...

12:46.700 --> 12:49.200
...thought he was God's gift to women.

12:49.800 --> 12:53.200
What the hell, doubled my commissions
in the first six months.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.000
Goddamn, it's about time.
Vilmer, listen.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.600
Some kids got in a wreck up the road.
One of them is hurt.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.000
Wait a second.
Which way?

13:02.400 --> 13:04.500
- Back that way.
- How far?

13:05.700 --> 13:06.400
About a mile.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.600
About a mile back up 709 from me.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.900
Why do blonds stick their heads out
car windows?

13:21.600 --> 13:22.500
Why?

13:22.800 --> 13:24.300
To get a refill.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.200
I don't get it.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.400
Airheads?

13:31.800 --> 13:34.200
We should get back there
and see if Sean's okay.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.000
What was that?

13:38.600 --> 13:39.400
Don't worry.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.200
It's just some farmer's wife.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.700
Like I'm even interested!

13:45.100 --> 13:46.100
See them and weep!

13:51.800 --> 13:53.600
Or some high-school boy.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.100
They're always doing something
to get me to flash them.

14:01.800 --> 14:02.800
What?

14:17.500 --> 14:20.000
Is an ambulance coming?
This guy's hurt.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.200
I think he's delirious.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.600
Is he okay?

14:37.800 --> 14:39.200
Boy's dead.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.700
He's not. He's just passed out.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.600
I said he's dead.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.200
He was just talking in his sleep.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.000
Is that right?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.100
Well...

15:02.900 --> 15:04.600
He's dead now.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.800
Don't run off down that road.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.300
- It won't do you any good.
- What'll you do?

15:12.300 --> 15:15.100
First, I'm gonna kill you.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.500
It ain't no fucking biggie.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.900
Of course, it's different
for every individual.

15:45.900 --> 15:49.600
Sorry I can't give you a ride.
The wrecker will be here soon.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.900
- Thanks for calling for us.
- Yeah, thanks.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.400
Don't worry about that boy that drives
the wrecker. He talks tough.

15:58.900 --> 16:03.100
Tell him how the cows eat the cabbage
and you won't have any trouble.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.700
Thanks a lot.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.800
What about that service station?
Can someone there give us a ride?

16:09.300 --> 16:13.500
That old man? He's liable to shoot
first and ask questions later.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.700
We see you, you old fart!

16:21.100 --> 16:22.400
Thanks. Bye.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.700
You tired yet, boy?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.900
- Please, you're scaring me.
- No shit.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.100
What did I do?

16:50.500 --> 16:52.200
Let's just say you're shit out of luck.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.300
What can I do? Give me a chance.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.200
We ain't even having fun yet, son.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.099
Run, run, run!

17:10.099 --> 17:11.300
Swing right.

17:19.700 --> 17:23.000
Come back to Papa now!

17:28.000 --> 17:30.500
All right, racing fans...

17:31.100 --> 17:32.100
...here...

17:32.300 --> 17:33.400
...we...

17:33.700 --> 17:35.200
...go!

17:55.800 --> 17:57.700
This is what I want

18:00.600 --> 18:01.500
Still kicking?

18:08.700 --> 18:12.400
That should've done it!
Yes, that should have done it.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.900
There's somebody out there.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.100
I mean it this time.
I'm not making it up. Stop.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.700
- Listen.
- I don't hear anything.

18:29.100 --> 18:31.200
Jenny, stop. My feet hurt.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.100
Am I supposed to carry you?

18:33.500 --> 18:35.000
Carry me piggyback.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.000
Just for a while.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.600
Lose 20 pounds.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.100
Oh, man. All right.
This guy's a lifesaver.

18:48.700 --> 18:50.600
All we need is a ride! We'll pay!

18:55.200 --> 18:58.300
Wait! We could get arrested
for trespassing!

19:37.600 --> 19:39.300
Please, come on.

19:43.400 --> 19:47.600
If you guys can hear me, I'm gonna
go back and see if Sean's okay.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.500
All right?

19:52.800 --> 19:53.900
All right?

20:11.900 --> 20:13.100
No, wait!

20:34.000 --> 20:35.700
Okay, who's there?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.700
Is there anybody there?

21:07.700 --> 21:08.700
Wait.

21:09.100 --> 21:10.000
Stop.

21:10.300 --> 21:12.400
What if they want us to follow them...

21:12.800 --> 21:15.000
...so they can hide and stab us?

21:15.400 --> 21:18.300
There could be dead people
buried all around us.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.000
They could tie us in a cellar.
No one'd hear us.

21:21.300 --> 21:24.500
That's dumb. There are no cellars
in the houses around here.

21:24.900 --> 21:27.600
That's it. Don't call me dumb.

21:28.100 --> 21:31.600
I may not be the smartest person
in the world, but I'm not stupid.

21:31.900 --> 21:34.600
I act that way sometimes
to get people to like me.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.200
Yeah, right.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.300
All those stories about murderers,
I know it's not true.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.400
It's better than being bored.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.800
What's stupid is what you said
about you and Brenda.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.700
No one would believe that.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.400
She started this whole thing.
It's her fault.

21:50.800 --> 21:51.900
You'd like to think.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.500
I'll tell you what it is.
I'm a bitch.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.200
I'm just like my mother.
She can't stand my father...

21:58.600 --> 22:01.600
...but she stays with him because
she wants a certain kind of life.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.600
No matter what anybody thinks,
that's the way to get it.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.300
What's wrong with that?

22:08.600 --> 22:09.700
Forget it.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.400
You should've said something.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.600
It pisses me off
when you let me go on.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
It's embarrassing.

22:16.300 --> 22:18.000
I told you, I'm a bitch.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.500
If I were braver, I'd be like Jenny.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.200
No, you wouldn't.

22:24.300 --> 22:25.700
You're probably right.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.100
She's a dog.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.800
You just don't know.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.500
Everyone thinks she's such a wuss.

22:34.300 --> 22:36.300
Her mother gets married
every 15 minutes.

22:36.700 --> 22:39.700
Her husbands always hit on her.
That's why she's that way.

22:40.100 --> 22:43.200
But I've had P.E. With her.
She's got a body to die for.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.400
Really?

23:16.000 --> 23:17.100
Great.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.400
Tell them we'll give them
$50 for a ride.

23:33.800 --> 23:34.600
Fifty bucks?

23:34.900 --> 23:37.300
Don't give it to them.
Tell them to send us a bill.

23:37.800 --> 23:41.900
If they get mad, give them 5 bucks.
Tell them we'll send the rest later.

23:42.300 --> 23:43.800
It's no big deal.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.700
It's just business.
My father does it all the time.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.200
You are weird.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.500
Hey, is anybody home?

24:06.100 --> 24:07.600
Must be deaf.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.100
Hey, is anybody in there?

24:11.700 --> 24:13.300
Maybe they're out back.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.200
Go check.

24:16.800 --> 24:17.900
I have an idea.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.900
Why don't I go check?

24:20.300 --> 24:21.200
Bitch.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.200
Damn it!

26:11.400 --> 26:13.900
Hold it right there.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.700
It's okay. We had a wreck.
All we want is a ride.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.500
You better not shoot me.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.700
A man shot a kid wrapping his house.
They got him for murder.

26:26.900 --> 26:31.200
"I propose to fight it out on this line
if it takes all summer."

26:31.700 --> 26:33.400
That's Ulysses S. Grant.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.900
You didn't know that, did you?

26:36.400 --> 26:37.600
Of course you didn't.

26:38.100 --> 26:40.500
Because you're a bona fide moron.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.600
Come nosing around here
where you don't belong.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.500
It's okay. She's my girlfriend.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.100
Don't trouble yourself.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.300
No! God!

28:21.000 --> 28:22.800
Please! Please!

29:10.400 --> 29:12.200
If I go in there, it's kidnapping.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.500
I know what I'm talking about.

29:15.300 --> 29:18.100
"Among other evils that being unarmed
brings you...

29:18.500 --> 29:20.600
...it causes you to be despised."

29:21.000 --> 29:22.800
That's Niccolò Machiavelli.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.000
Now get!

29:24.700 --> 29:26.000
I need to use your bathroom.

29:29.000 --> 29:29.800
Dumb ass!

29:39.600 --> 29:41.100
Heather, you in here?

30:13.500 --> 30:15.000
Damn it, I need to piss.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.700
Where's the bathroom?

30:39.900 --> 30:41.300
Heather, are you okay?

30:47.500 --> 30:49.800
There's a crazy guy outside
with a shotgun.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.600
Locked him out, though.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.400
You should've seen me.

31:16.900 --> 31:17.900
Fuck!

31:24.400 --> 31:25.600
What's going on?

31:49.300 --> 31:50.300
Who's out there?

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
You shouldn't walk these roads
at night. Get in.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.100
Did you move the cars?

32:41.500 --> 32:43.600
Do you want a ride or not?
It's up to you.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.500
Where are you going?

32:45.900 --> 32:47.100
Where's Sean?

32:48.500 --> 32:49.700
Where do you want to go?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.200
Where's Sean?

32:51.700 --> 32:52.900
Your boyfriend?

32:53.300 --> 32:55.600
The one who wasn't hurt.
Know where he is?

32:56.000 --> 32:58.100
I know where he is. Get in.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.300
- Well, where is he?
- Damn it, get in the truck.

33:02.900 --> 33:04.400
Wait a second. Hang on.

33:28.700 --> 33:31.400
You gotta watch it, getting
into strangers' cars.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.700
I heard about an old man...

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
...picked up a girl on the road...

33:41.400 --> 33:44.700
...cut her arms off, put her
in a culvert. Left her for dead.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.500
God, I fucking hate that.

33:48.500 --> 33:52.400
That son of a bitch didn't have shit
for an imagination.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.900
How simple can you get?

33:55.300 --> 33:57.600
- Stop. You're scaring me.
- Scaring you?

33:58.200 --> 33:59.400
You're not scared.

33:59.800 --> 34:03.100
You don't know shit
about being scared yet.

34:03.900 --> 34:05.200
You want "scared"?

34:05.600 --> 34:06.600
You want "scared"?

34:07.200 --> 34:09.199
Have a look behind you. Look!

34:10.400 --> 34:12.500
How about that? Look again, damn it!

34:12.900 --> 34:14.000
Look again!

34:14.400 --> 34:16.199
I think I want you to let me out.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.699
You think? Or do you know?

34:19.800 --> 34:22.300
- Have a look! Get a better look!
- No!

34:22.699 --> 34:24.199
Don't want to look?

34:24.600 --> 34:25.500
What's wrong?

34:25.900 --> 34:26.900
Okay.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.400
If you stop, I'll look.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.400
- You wanted "stop."
- Stop it!

34:33.800 --> 34:35.900
Come on, have a look at that.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.199
Look at that.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.199
Look at that. What is that?

34:39.900 --> 34:40.900
What is that?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.199
Oh, God!

34:48.600 --> 34:50.699
You have to put in something extra...

34:51.100 --> 34:53.000
...to show it ain't the cartoons.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.800
What's gonna happen to me?

34:59.200 --> 35:02.300
You think I give a goddamn
what happens to you?

35:04.200 --> 35:05.400
Are you letting me go?

35:05.800 --> 35:08.000
Figure it out. It's your life.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.000
I don't understand.

35:12.100 --> 35:13.500
Welcome to the real world.

36:17.100 --> 36:19.500
You don't know what you're doing.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.100
Where do you think you're going?

36:36.700 --> 36:37.600
Okay...

36:38.800 --> 36:40.300
...if that's what you want.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.600
It's up to you.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.800
Live and learn.

38:05.900 --> 38:07.700
No, no, God, no!

38:26.700 --> 38:28.300
Somebody!

42:23.900 --> 42:25.400
Open this door!

42:26.500 --> 42:27.400
Open this...!

42:29.200 --> 42:30.400
Oh, God!

42:31.500 --> 42:32.700
It's okay.

42:33.100 --> 42:34.100
He's out there!

42:37.600 --> 42:40.100
Sit down.
I'm gonna go see what's what.

43:36.300 --> 43:38.800
The guy with the wrecker killed Sean.

43:39.600 --> 43:41.400
Hell's bells, it's party time.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.300
What about your friends?

43:43.700 --> 43:45.400
They tried to get a ride.

43:45.800 --> 43:49.400
What the hell is going on?
Where's Vilmer?

44:00.700 --> 44:02.000
Now listen...

44:02.900 --> 44:04.600
...don't you worry.

44:05.200 --> 44:07.900
Vilmer does something,
there's a good reason.

44:08.300 --> 44:09.200
Who's Vilmer?

44:09.500 --> 44:11.000
Good question.

44:11.800 --> 44:15.800
You know what? You look real pretty
with your glasses off.

44:17.800 --> 44:18.600
What?

44:18.900 --> 44:21.400
You should've brought a gunnysack
or something.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.200
What's this look like to you?
Green eggs?

44:25.700 --> 44:28.400
What the hell are you waiting for?
Tie her up!

44:29.000 --> 44:30.300
Sit down, little lady.

44:30.700 --> 44:32.300
I got enough trouble...

44:33.200 --> 44:34.400
Look what you started.

44:34.800 --> 44:37.900
Wait till Vilmer hears about this,
I swear to God.

44:42.300 --> 44:43.400
Where's my gun?

44:49.700 --> 44:53.100
It's easier to resist at the beginning
than at the end.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.700
Be sure to tell Vilmer I'm going
to the pizza place to get some dinner.

45:09.600 --> 45:12.000
Why are you doing this?

45:12.400 --> 45:16.800
"Conversation's a game of circles."
That's Ralph Waldo Emerson.

45:18.100 --> 45:21.400
What if I turned you loose?
What would you give me?

45:21.900 --> 45:22.900
What about that?

45:23.300 --> 45:27.000
- What do you want?
- I'll tell you what I want.

45:27.300 --> 45:30.200
W.E., what the hell
are you doing back there?

45:32.500 --> 45:34.200
Tell you what.

45:38.300 --> 45:40.300
Grow up, will you?

45:43.500 --> 45:46.500
Tell Vilmer our pizza will be ready
when I get there...

45:46.900 --> 45:48.800
...and then I'm coming home.

45:59.400 --> 46:03.200
One medium deluxe, one medium
pepperoni, one large vegetarian...

46:03.700 --> 46:05.400
...and I'll get your drinks.

46:07.600 --> 46:08.800
Lady...

46:09.500 --> 46:10.900
...I think something's in your trunk.

46:12.200 --> 46:14.300
That's just somebody I got tied up.

46:14.700 --> 46:15.500
Really?

46:15.900 --> 46:17.400
Really, what's back there?

46:18.900 --> 46:20.400
You wanna come see?

46:20.800 --> 46:21.600
Sure.

46:25.700 --> 46:27.800
I better not, I might get in trouble.

46:28.600 --> 46:29.700
All right.

46:37.900 --> 46:40.900
Will you shut up
and quit kicking my car?

46:41.400 --> 46:43.200
Okay, but I can't breathe.

46:43.800 --> 46:45.100
Can I get your order?

46:45.500 --> 46:47.900
What do you want? Black coffee?

46:48.500 --> 46:50.000
Two black coffees.

46:50.400 --> 46:51.500
Is that all?

46:53.100 --> 46:55.300
If I poke a hole for you,
will you quit?

47:00.200 --> 47:02.500
Well, somebody's gotta do it.

47:03.200 --> 47:04.400
In your dreams.

47:05.400 --> 47:08.000
If I hear any more kicking
or screaming...

47:08.500 --> 47:11.000
...l'm gonna tape your mouth shut.

47:13.700 --> 47:15.600
What you got in the car, honey?

47:17.600 --> 47:19.700
Believe me, you don't wanna know.

47:20.100 --> 47:22.000
Come on, I'm a nice guy.

47:26.900 --> 47:29.000
Ma'am, your drinks are ready.

48:32.100 --> 48:34.600
What are you doing out here
in the road?

48:35.900 --> 48:36.800
Please...

48:38.700 --> 48:39.600
...help me.

48:41.200 --> 48:42.300
All right...

48:42.700 --> 48:46.300
...but I have to run and get a blanket.
You stay right there.

49:01.400 --> 49:03.900
Please don't hit me. Don't!

49:06.100 --> 49:07.600
Don't hit me!

49:09.300 --> 49:10.200
Stop!

49:11.500 --> 49:12.400
Okay...

49:13.300 --> 49:15.500
...but don't you go crawling off.

49:50.900 --> 49:54.300
- I said get on out there. Move!
- Leave him alone.

49:56.300 --> 49:58.400
You do whatever W.E. Tells you.

49:58.800 --> 50:01.300
He even tries to hit you,
let me know...

50:01.900 --> 50:03.000
...and I'll tell Vilmer.

50:03.600 --> 50:07.500
"I have not yet begun to fight."
That's John Paul Jones.

50:10.300 --> 50:14.100
You can scare him, but you so much
as lay a finger on me...

50:14.600 --> 50:16.600
...you'll wish you'd never been born.

50:27.800 --> 50:28.700
I almost forgot...

50:29.100 --> 50:32.600
...one of them got away down the road.
Better get her too.

50:35.600 --> 50:37.200
Come on. Bring her in.

50:38.600 --> 50:40.100
I'm not gonna hurt you.

50:40.500 --> 50:42.600
I'm not gonna hurt you. See?

50:42.900 --> 50:45.300
See? I'm right here.
Not gonna hurt you.

50:45.700 --> 50:47.700
Go on. Get in there.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.100
Move!

50:49.700 --> 50:50.600
Get!

50:51.200 --> 50:52.600
Get, I said!

50:54.500 --> 50:56.900
Hi, sweetie.
How was your day?

50:57.300 --> 50:58.900
Sweetie, would you shut up?

50:59.400 --> 51:01.600
What are you so pissed off about?

51:03.500 --> 51:05.400
You having a bad day?

51:05.800 --> 51:07.600
Why aren't my batteries charged?

51:11.600 --> 51:13.200
Did W.E. Tell you?

51:14.600 --> 51:15.800
That son of a bitch!

51:16.200 --> 51:19.100
I told him to tell you
I was getting pizza.

51:19.500 --> 51:21.200
He didn't, and I'm sick of it.

51:27.200 --> 51:28.800
Look what your brother did.

51:29.600 --> 51:33.500
Nobody gives a damn about that door.
I've had it with you.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.700
I'm sick of you trying to make
trouble between me and Vilmer.

51:38.200 --> 51:40.000
You're nothing but trouble.

51:40.400 --> 51:43.500
I put things together here.
It was fine before you come.

51:43.900 --> 51:44.800
Shut up.

51:49.100 --> 51:50.000
Oh, my God.

51:51.000 --> 51:51.900
What are you gonna...?

51:52.300 --> 51:54.000
You don't believe this, do you?

51:54.300 --> 51:56.100
What are you gonna do to me?

51:56.500 --> 51:58.000
I asked you a goddamn question.

51:58.400 --> 51:59.700
He asked you a goddamn...

52:00.600 --> 52:02.200
Yes, I believe...

52:03.600 --> 52:07.100
You don't think the FBI
has us under 24-hour surveillance?

52:07.600 --> 52:09.600
And transmitters in all these walls?

52:10.000 --> 52:11.300
I don't know.

52:11.700 --> 52:13.200
Let me ask you a question.

52:14.300 --> 52:16.900
- Are you having fun yet?
- Oh, God!

52:17.300 --> 52:19.000
Because I promise you...

52:19.400 --> 52:21.400
...you and I are gonna have some fun.

52:21.800 --> 52:23.200
No more, please.

52:23.600 --> 52:25.300
What's my fucking name?

52:26.700 --> 52:27.600
- What's this?
- I don't know.

52:27.900 --> 52:30.100
- What is this?
- I don't know.

52:33.500 --> 52:35.400
You don't know shit, do you?

52:39.100 --> 52:41.800
Do you think all I wanna do
is kill you?

52:42.200 --> 52:43.400
I don't know.

52:44.700 --> 52:46.900
You're goddamn right, you don't.

52:51.100 --> 52:54.000
Why don't you try to relax?
I know it's hard...

52:54.400 --> 52:56.300
Why don't you mind your business?

52:58.200 --> 53:00.700
Look at this fucking door.

53:07.900 --> 53:08.900
What?

53:10.600 --> 53:14.300
"The woman's a whore
and there's an end on it."

53:14.700 --> 53:16.500
That's Samuel Johnson.

53:17.700 --> 53:19.900
Oh, take it on out of here.

53:23.400 --> 53:24.300
Now, now...

53:25.500 --> 53:29.000
...don't let him get to you,
because that's what he wants.

53:31.800 --> 53:33.100
Please tell me...

53:33.600 --> 53:35.500
...what all this is for.

53:35.900 --> 53:38.200
You'll have to ask Vilmer that.

53:38.600 --> 53:43.000
If you ask me, I think the son of a
bitch is from outer space.

53:51.600 --> 53:52.800
What are you gonna do?

53:53.200 --> 53:53.900
No...

53:54.500 --> 53:56.300
...what are you gonna do?

54:00.000 --> 54:01.100
Don't hurt her.

54:01.400 --> 54:04.500
- Give her a kiss.
- How could I hurt this pretty face?

54:05.500 --> 54:06.400
But then...

54:07.000 --> 54:08.900
...I am in the mood for love.

54:26.900 --> 54:28.100
There now...

54:29.100 --> 54:31.200
How's that? Feel better?

54:33.600 --> 54:35.000
Look at you!

54:36.300 --> 54:38.000
You're really pretty.

54:39.300 --> 54:40.500
You know what?

54:40.900 --> 54:43.700
I've got this dress
I've never even worn...

54:44.100 --> 54:46.400
...and it would be perfect on you.

54:48.800 --> 54:50.800
Oh, you're scared.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.800
I just don't wanna die.

54:56.200 --> 54:58.800
Well, of course you don't!

55:01.700 --> 55:03.200
Will you help me?

55:04.600 --> 55:06.500
Shut up in there.

55:07.700 --> 55:11.400
You hush up yourself.
It's just girl talk.

55:13.100 --> 55:16.700
He's not near as bad as he seems
once you get to know him.

55:17.100 --> 55:20.300
It's just this job, you know,
all the stress.

55:20.800 --> 55:23.100
It's his job to kill people?

55:23.600 --> 55:24.400
Well...

55:24.900 --> 55:26.600
...I shouldn't tell you this.

55:26.900 --> 55:30.200
You know those stories you hear
of people who run everything...

55:30.700 --> 55:32.600
...but nobody knows who they are?

55:34.200 --> 55:37.800
Well, it's true. I didn't believe it,
but it's true.

55:38.300 --> 55:39.900
Who do you think killed Kennedy?

55:40.300 --> 55:41.100
Government?

55:42.100 --> 55:44.200
That government stuff is bull crap.

55:44.600 --> 55:45.800
It's these people.

55:46.100 --> 55:50.400
They been doing this kind of thing for
1000 or 2000 years, I forget which.

55:50.900 --> 55:53.900
And nobody, I mean nobody,
knows their names.

55:54.400 --> 55:56.700
That's who Vilmer works for.

55:57.200 --> 55:59.000
I told you... No!

56:06.700 --> 56:08.200
Alone again, huh?

56:14.600 --> 56:16.300
Little desert flower.

56:19.900 --> 56:21.500
I've got a mind...

56:26.300 --> 56:28.300
...to slit your goddamn throat.

56:29.200 --> 56:30.900
Count of 10 to tell why I shouldn't.

56:31.300 --> 56:32.200
Nine, eight...

56:32.500 --> 56:34.400
...don't be late.

56:35.200 --> 56:36.900
Seven, six,
better get it right.

56:37.300 --> 56:38.900
Why you shouldn't kill me?

56:39.700 --> 56:40.500
Five, four...

56:43.700 --> 56:46.600
- Three, two!
- Because you want me alive!

56:47.000 --> 56:49.300
You want me alive for some reason.

56:51.300 --> 56:52.600
That's a good answer.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.300
That's a good answer.

56:59.000 --> 56:59.900
Smart girl.

57:00.500 --> 57:02.800
We've got us a smart girl.

57:05.600 --> 57:08.000
Kind of makes you think, doesn't it?

57:26.900 --> 57:29.700
You're embarrassing me
in front of company!

57:47.700 --> 57:49.100
Okay, stop!

57:50.600 --> 57:52.300
Don't move or I'll shoot!

57:54.900 --> 57:56.200
What'd she say?

57:58.400 --> 58:00.600
"Nobody move or I'll shoot"?

58:02.900 --> 58:04.900
My advice? Gut-shoot him.

58:05.300 --> 58:07.800
Poison his insides,
or it won't do no good.

58:08.200 --> 58:11.600
He's been shot before,
lots of times. Run over.

58:12.100 --> 58:14.200
- It don't mean spit.
- Shut up, W.E.

58:14.600 --> 58:16.800
- Nobody asked you.
- You shut up.

58:17.500 --> 58:18.600
Everybody, shut up!

58:19.000 --> 58:20.200
Why don't you shut up?

58:22.900 --> 58:24.600
Get down on the floor.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.800
Put your hands in front of you!

58:28.800 --> 58:29.600
Get down!

58:30.000 --> 58:30.900
Okay.

58:42.300 --> 58:43.400
You get down too.

58:46.400 --> 58:47.700
What are you gonna do...

58:48.300 --> 58:49.200
...shoot me?

58:50.600 --> 58:51.500
Yeah...

58:51.800 --> 58:53.400
...if you try something.

58:54.900 --> 58:55.900
What if I do this?

58:56.300 --> 58:58.700
Goddamn it, that ain't funny!

59:03.300 --> 59:06.300
Now we're going. What do you think?

59:08.100 --> 59:09.200
One, two.

59:10.300 --> 59:12.000
Take your fucking chances.

59:12.400 --> 59:13.500
It's a damn trick.

59:13.800 --> 59:15.400
Shut up, W.E.

59:15.800 --> 59:17.300
Why don't you shut up?

59:17.700 --> 59:19.900
Just forget it, hon.

59:20.300 --> 59:23.400
If that shotgun was anywhere
you could get it...

59:23.800 --> 59:26.200
...it's where he wanted it.

59:28.600 --> 59:31.200
You stop. You get back down.

59:31.900 --> 59:34.300
"Discretion is the better part
of valour."

59:34.700 --> 59:35.800
Billy Shakespeare.

59:38.200 --> 59:40.200
Get down, or I'll kill you.

59:42.100 --> 59:43.200
Come on.

59:43.600 --> 59:44.700
I'm sorry, sweetie.

59:45.400 --> 59:48.000
I got a big mouth, what can I say?

59:49.100 --> 59:52.900
Okay, maybe it's not loaded.
But maybe it is, so fuck you.

59:53.300 --> 59:57.600
And if you try and come near,
I'm gonna blow your fucking head off!

59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.300
- Come on.
- Let's not make this an all-nighter.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.500
I hate to be a party pooper, but it's
late and the pizza's getting cold.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And nobody asked you!

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.800
Heather, get up.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.200
Get up!

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:18.900
You have to!

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.000
Five more minutes.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.200
Get up!

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.100
You're gonna kill her!

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.800
Come on, get up, get up.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.500
I can't find my shoes.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.100
It's okay. Get up.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:45.200
No, you gotta get up.
We have to get out of here.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.300
Stop it!

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:57.700
Pop goes the weasel.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.300
Oh, my God!

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.300
What are you doing there?!

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.000
No, no, God!

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:54.000
What are you doing?!

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:04.600
Oh, God!

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.000
Damn shame about her face, Leather.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.400
At least you can have her shoes.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.900
We'll have to see that doesn't
happen again.

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.400
That'll settle her down for a while.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.200
You better be nice to me.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:32.600
'Cause I can always
go back to my husband.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.900
Is that all you got?

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.600
You better come and eat...

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.900
...before it gets cold.

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.700
All right, all right, all right!

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.200
What took you so long?

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.600
Welcome...

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.800
...to my world!

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.200
I suppose we can forget about having
a quiet evening?

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:59.500
Go ahead and breathe into this bag.
Go ahead.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:10.500
I told him a thousand times,
it's gonna end in tears.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.700
Lie down with dogs, get up with fleas.
Any fool knows that.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.000
"Common sense is not so common."

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.700
Henry Voltaire.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.800
Are you gonna help me or not?

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:31.600
- Are you gonna help me or not?
- And don't tell me any more stories.

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:34.100
You just don't understand.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.400
He doesn't work for anybody.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.200
The only reason for this...

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.800
...is, he's a psycho
and gets off on it.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.700
Get off.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.600
Now listen.

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:51.900
I just can't.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.400
He put this little thing in my head.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.900
All he has to do is push one
little button and...

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.300
...blow my head clean off.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.900
There's nothing in your head.

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.800
You just said a mouthful.

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:17.000
Get to running with the wrong crowd,
wind up in a reformatory.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.600
No respect, no discipline.
That's the problem.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.200
Family values have gone to hell.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.100
Now for why we came!

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:29.400
My brother is tired of
what's-her-name's face...

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.500
...and he wants a new one.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:35.600
It just happens to be
he wants this face right here.

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.000
Oh, no!

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.900
Don't touch me!

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.200
Don't you ever touch me!

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.500
If you're gonna kill me,
then do it!

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.900
I'm not putting up with any more crap!

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.400
It's bullshit.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:19.000
Nobody believes it
except your idiot girlfriend!

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:20.700
It's fucking pathetic!

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:29.000
"There is nothing to fear
but fear itself."

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.100
Now, I'm gonna leave...

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.200
...and no one is gonna stop me.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.600
You sit the fuck down!

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.800
And shut up!

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.899
Are we having a party or what?

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.600
Here we go!

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:02.500
Douse her down!

01:09:02.899 --> 01:09:06.100
You can't do that!
She has nothing to do with this!

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.800
- That doesn't matter!
- I'm sorry! Please!

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.200
Fire in the hole!

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:12.700
Burn!

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.300
Watch her burn!

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.899
Go to hell!

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:22.700
Burn!

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:38.399
Why'd you do that? I can never
get that smell out of my clothes.

01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:58.600
Well...

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:01.800
...what the hell do you want?

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.500
I assume that that is
a rhetorical question.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.300
Assume whatever you please.
It ain't no skin off my ass.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.400
Is that what you want me to think?

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.700
That you're a silly boy?

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.100
Oh, God, you have to help me.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.700
They're crazy. Please, let's go.

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:53.900
- Let's go, please.
- It's all right.

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:01.700
That's better. Come on, now.

01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:04.900
Come on. It's all right.

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:08.900
Just sit down. There you go.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.500
There.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.100
That's all right.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.600
That's fine. You just stay there.
It'll be fine, okay?

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.200
Come on, now.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.600
It's all right. All right.

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.000
Come on, there. There. See?

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.100
What is this?

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.300
No?

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.300
Can anybody else tell me?

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.100
Things are gonna change.

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.000
I can promise you that.

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.500
- Just sit there.
- No.

01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.700
You just sit there.

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:07.800
You...

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.800
...fuck!

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.900
This... is... appalling.

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.800
You are here for one reason...

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.200
...and one reason only.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.700
Do you understand that?

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.300
I want to hear you say
you understand that.

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.100
No?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.700
It's very simple.

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:38.100
I want these people...

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:41.500
...to know the meaning of horror.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:44.500
Horror.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.000
Is that clear?

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:52.600
You don't want to be a silly boy.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.100
Is... that... clear?

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:09.000
Is... that... clear?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.800
Fucking-A, it is.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.100
What...?

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.600
What are you...?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.500
What are you doing?

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:34.200
Why a woman like you
has anything to do with this...

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:37.900
...cripple...

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:40.500
...is a mystery to me.

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:44.000
You bastard.
You know exactly why I'm here.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.300
What are you gonna do?

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.900
Oh, God, what are you doing?

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:19.800
What?

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:25.400
No! Don't! It's not your fault!
Stop that.

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:25.000
Get her, Leather! Get her, Leather!
We got some more fun today!

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.900
Get that bitch!

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.400
Thank you, Mrs. Spottis.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.700
It's a beautiful morning.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.200
- Stop!
- Don't stop, don't stop!

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.300
Stop! Please, stop! Oh, God!

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.300
Oh, God! Help!

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.000
There's a monster chasing her
with a chain saw!

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:34.200
Step on it, Mr. Spottis!

01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:57.800
You have nothing to fear.

01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:25.000
This...

01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:29.100
...all of this...

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:32.000
...it's been an abomination.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.400
Please accept my apologies.

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:38.700
It was supposed to be a spiritual
experience.

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:40.700
I can't tell you how...

01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:42.800
...disappointed I am.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:46.500
I suppose it's something
we all live with...

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:51.200
...people like us
who strive for something...

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.700
...a sense of harmony.

01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:59.500
Perhaps it's disappointment
that keeps us going.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.700
Unfortunately...

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.500
...it's never been easy for me.

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.300
One of my many failings.

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:14.200
Fuck you.

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:19.900
Do you want to go
to the local hospital...

01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:22.200
...or to a police station?

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
This isn't the first time
something like this has happened.

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:28.000
Miss?

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.600
Miss?

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:34.700
We'll find out what this is all about.
This isn't the end of it.

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:45.500
Miss?

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:49.800
Do you know who that is, miss?

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.200
What the hell's going on around here?

01:22:56.305 --> 01:23:02.689
