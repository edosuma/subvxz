00:47.427 --> 00:50.871
My name's Ralph and I'm a bad guy

00:51.757 --> 00:54.830
Ah.. Let's see
I'm 9 feet tall

00:55.165 --> 00:59.592
I weigh 643 pounds
Got a little bit of a temper on me

00:59.627 --> 01:01.983
Hey, you moved my stump!

01:03.118 --> 01:06.241
My passion bubbles very
near the surface, I guess..

01:06.451 --> 01:07.855
I'm not gonna lie

01:08.981 --> 01:10.537
Anywho.. what else?
Aaah...

01:11.703 --> 01:14.316
I'm a wrecker I wreck things

01:14.351 --> 01:16.976
Professionally I'm gonna wreck it!

01:17.070 --> 01:20.488
I mean, I'm very good at what I do
Probably the best I know

01:20.707 --> 01:26.113
The thing is, Fixing is the name of
the game Literally, Fix-It Felix, Jr.

01:27.519 --> 01:29.600
I can fix it!

01:29.601 --> 01:33.354
So, ya.. naturally the guy with the name
Fix-it Felix is the good guy

01:33.554 --> 01:37.271
He's nice enough as good guys go
Definitely fixes stuff really well..

01:37.371 --> 01:43.688
but,.. aah.. if you got a magic hammer
from your father, how hard can it be?

01:43.830 --> 01:46.883
If he was a regular contractor..
carpenter guy

01:46.884 --> 01:51.347
I guarantee you, you would not be able
to fix the damage that I do.. as quickly

01:52.873 --> 01:55.309
And when Felix does a good job
He gets a medal

01:55.648 --> 02:02.451
But are there medals for wrecking stuff
really well? To that I say HAAH!!

02:03.122 --> 02:05.561
And no... there aren't

02:05.562 --> 02:08.547
- So cool..
- This animation is so real

02:08.582 --> 02:10.511
30 years I've been doing this

02:10.545 --> 02:13.906
And I've seen a lot other games
come and go.. kinda sad

02:13.941 --> 02:18.030
Think about all those guys from Asteroids?
...Boom!! ..gone..

02:18.065 --> 02:21.482
Centipede??
Who knows where that guy is.. you know

02:21.876 --> 02:25.286
Look a steady arcade game is nothing
to sneeze at I'm very lucky

02:26.729 --> 02:29.049
It's just.. I got to say:

02:29.084 --> 02:33.673
It becomes kinda hard to love your job
when no one seems to like you for doing it

02:37.500 --> 02:40.344
All clear..
The Arcade's closed!

02:41.814 --> 02:45.734
Woo.. what a day.
So, you wanna head to Tappers, Ken?

02:45.969 --> 02:47.727
If you're buyin' buddy

02:51.179 --> 02:53.326
Quittin' time!

03:04.490 --> 03:10.305
I donno.. Maybe I won't be feeling this
way if things were different after work

03:10.628 --> 03:13.550
But.. it is what it is.
- Good job, everyone!

03:13.585 --> 03:17.409
Felix and the Nicelanders
go hang out in their homes..

03:17.444 --> 03:20.075
which he just fixed and very..you know

03:21.695 --> 03:27.594
They go to their homes, I go to mine..
which happens to be.. a dump

03:27.629 --> 03:33.414
And when I say a dump I don't mean like
a shabby palce, I mean an actual dump

03:33.449 --> 03:36.174
Where the garbage goes
and a bunch of bricks

03:36.175 --> 03:38.899
and smashed building parts.. that's..

03:39.767 --> 03:42.017
That's what I call home.

03:42.540 --> 03:47.213
I guess I can't bellyache too much
without my bricks, without my stump.

03:49.677 --> 03:52.642
It looks uncomfortable
it's actually fine

03:52.677 --> 03:54.643
I'm good

03:57.454 --> 04:02.275
But..
if I'm really honest with myself

04:02.310 --> 04:06.823
I see Felix up there..
getting patted on the back..

04:06.858 --> 04:11.170
people are giving him pie..
thanking him and..

04:11.205 --> 04:16.678
so happy to see him all the time..
Sometime to think..

04:16.785 --> 04:22.983
Man!.. Sure must be nice
being the good guy

04:25.038 --> 04:28.515
Nice share, Ralph. As fellow
bad guys we've all felt

04:28.516 --> 04:31.992
what you're feeling and
we've come to terms with it

04:32.027 --> 04:36.799
Really?
- Right here, I'm Zangief, I'm bad guy!

04:37.706 --> 04:40.581
I relate to you Ralph When I hit bottom

04:40.582 --> 04:45.587
I was crushing man skull
like sparrow egg between my thighs

04:46.403 --> 04:49.287
And I think, why you
have to be so bad Zangief?

04:49.422 --> 04:51.940
Why can't you be more like good guy?

04:52.197 --> 04:54.813
Then I have moment of clarity

04:54.848 --> 05:01.131
If Zangief is good guy.. who'll crush man
skull like sparrow's egg between thighs?

05:01.231 --> 05:07.799
And I say, Zangief, you are bad guy,
but this does not mean you are bad guy.

05:09.771 --> 05:12.724
Right, I'm sorry. I
just..You lost me there.

05:12.725 --> 05:15.676
- Zombie, bad guy.

05:15.839 --> 05:19.510
Zangief saying:
Labels not make you happy

05:19.511 --> 05:22.835
Good...
Bad....

05:22.935 --> 05:24.944
You must love you

05:24.979 --> 05:27.192
Yea.. inside here!

05:27.317 --> 05:29.217
Whoa, whoa ..ok oh!
alright ..I get you..

05:29.236 --> 05:31.786
Watch out, it's dripping
- Question, Ralph

05:31.787 --> 05:34.910
We've been asking you
to BAD-ANON for years

05:34.911 --> 05:38.033
now and tonight you..
you finally show up

05:38.068 --> 05:41.181
Why is that?
- I donno, I just felt like coming

05:41.281 --> 05:44.945
I mean, I suppose it has something
to do with the fact that.. uh..

05:45.857 --> 05:48.768
Well.. today is the 30th Anniversary
of my game

05:48.868 --> 05:52.010
Happy Anniversary, Ralph
- Thanks, Satan.

05:52.011 --> 05:55.503
Err,. it's Satine, actually
- Got it!

05:55.804 --> 05:57.844
But here's the thing..

05:59.681 --> 06:01.932
I don't wanna be the bad guy anymore

06:04.885 --> 06:09.618
You can't mess with the program Ralph.
- You're not going Turbo, are you?

06:09.653 --> 06:13.116
Turbo? No, I'm not going Turbo
C'mon guys!!

06:13.117 --> 06:15.529
Is it Turbo who don't want a friend?
Or a medal?

06:15.530 --> 06:17.940
or a piece of pie every once in a while?

06:17.975 --> 06:20.620
Is it Turbo who want more out of life?
- Yess...

06:21.462 --> 06:23.592
Ralph, Ralph.. we get it!

06:23.593 --> 06:27.140
But we can't change who we are
And the sooner you accept that...

06:27.340 --> 06:31.228
..the better off your game
and your life will be.

06:31.263 --> 06:33.894
Hey, one game at a time, Ralph

06:34.021 --> 06:36.875
Now let's close out with the
Bad Guy Affirmation

06:40.595 --> 06:46.071
I am bad, and that's good
I will never be good

06:46.072 --> 06:51.097
And that's not bad
There's no one I'd rather be than me

06:51.671 --> 06:53.657
Ok guys, see you next week

06:55.094 --> 06:58.746
Hang in therel, Ralph.
- Hey Zombie, don't forget your hatchet

There you go

07:37.393 --> 07:40.561

Step aside sir, random security check

08:03.937 --> 08:06.033
Random my behind, you always stop me!

08:06.034 --> 08:08.128

and doing my job, sir.

08:08.398 --> 08:10.154
Name?

08:10.189 --> 08:11.884

08:11.885 --> 08:14.702

08:23.498 --> 08:25.041
Proceed.

08:28.364 --> 08:30.031
Bad guy coming..

08:31.692 --> 08:35.654
If you leave your game
stay safe, stay alert..

08:35.655 --> 08:38.082
and whatever you do..
don't die..

08:38.083 --> 08:42.779
Because if you die outside your own game
you don't regenerate ever

08:42.780 --> 08:44.169
Game over.

08:53.414 --> 08:55.411
Here you go, buddy

10:21.529 --> 10:25.651
He'll wreck the party.
- Get rid of him, Felix.

10:25.652 --> 10:29.587
Oh right! I'll go talk to him
Carry on everyone

10:31.385 --> 10:34.070
Ralph, can I help you?

10:34.105 --> 10:37.150
Hey Felix. Just wanted to check

10:37.151 --> 10:40.195

over the building there

10:40.608 --> 10:44.438
Oh.. That was our.. just fireworks

Never had it. No one ever
seem to throw it out so I..

11:23.729 --> 11:26.569
it never, never ends up in the dump,
I never actually tasted it

11:27.875 --> 11:31.021
I always wanted to try cake

11:31.874 --> 11:34.815
I don't suppose you'd like to
come in have a slice? would you?

11:34.816 --> 11:37.567

He's just here for a slice of cake

12:00.070 --> 12:02.654

game technically speaking

12:02.770 --> 12:04.875
Uh. Why are you here, Gene?

Umm.. what.. what's the flavor of

12:32.677 --> 12:36.875
Hm? Oh.. Chocolate
- Never been real fond of chocolate

12:37.076 --> 12:39.255
Well, I did not know that

12:39.256 --> 12:41.433
- One other little thing,
I hate to be picky but..

12:41.434 --> 12:44.842
you know this angry little
guy here would might be a

12:44.843 --> 12:48.249
lot happier if you put him
up here with everyone else

12:48.250 --> 12:51.522
See that? Look at that smile

12:51.523 --> 12:54.793
- No, no no.. You see Ralph,
there is no room for you up here

12:56.416 --> 12:59.366
Well what about this we can make room

12:59.367 --> 13:01.864
Here, we can take turn..
Easy!

13:01.865 --> 13:04.867
How about.. we just eat the cake?
- Hang on!

13:04.868 --> 13:08.950
Felix needs to be on the roof because
he's about to get his medal

13:08.952 --> 13:12.619
Well, how about we just take that medal
and give it to Ralph for once.

13:12.620 --> 13:16.125
Would that be the end of the world Gene?
- Now you're just being ridiculous

13:16.126 --> 13:20.415
Only good guys win medals
and you, sir .. are no good guy

13:20.416 --> 13:23.302
I could be a good guy if I wanted to
And I could win a medal

13:23.303 --> 13:26.821
Uh huh? and when you do
come and talk to us

13:26.822 --> 13:29.286
- And then would you finally let me
be on top of the cake with you guys?

13:29.287 --> 13:32.134
If you win a medal We'll let you
live up here in the Penthouse

13:32.135 --> 13:37.496
But it will never happen because you're
just the bad guy who wrecks the building

13:37.497 --> 13:40.427
No, I'm not
- Yes, you are.

13:40.428 --> 13:43.149
No, I'm not!!!

13:51.680 --> 13:54.635
Yes, you are

13:55.764 --> 13:59.687
Alright, Gene, you know what?
I'm gonna win a medal

13:59.688 --> 14:05.182
Oh I am gonna win a medal The shiniest
medal this place has ever seen

14:05.183 --> 14:11.096
A medal that will be so good that it
will make Felix's medals wet their pants

14:11.752 --> 14:14.371
And goodnight Thank you for the party

14:15.155 --> 14:17.318
Is he serious?

14:17.319 --> 14:19.481
- Oh please..where is a bad
guy gonna win a medal?

14:19.482 --> 14:21.578
Of course he's not serious

14:21.579 --> 14:24.732
I've never been more serious
about anything in my life

14:24.733 --> 14:29.053
That's why I came straight here Tapper
You never give me a bum steer now..

14:29.078 --> 14:32.278
C'mon.. where can a guy like me
go and win a medal

14:32.454 --> 14:35.076
I don't think such a game exist, Ralph

14:35.077 --> 14:36.787
Oh c'mon.. You know people,
there's gotta be..

14:36.788 --> 14:38.496

14:46.930 --> 14:50.095
Okay! As you were saying?
- I was saying...

14:50.196 --> 14:52.851
I can't spent another 30
years living alone in

14:52.852 --> 14:55.506
the garbage I'm not going
back without a medal

14:55.507 --> 14:59.286
Well, I don't know what to tell you
Maybe somebody left a medal here

14:59.287 --> 15:01.740

to lost and found

15:01.741 --> 15:05.499

But what about the game?
- I'll have someone look at it tomorrow

22:33.262 --> 22:35.581
But if he can't fix it,
it might be time to

22:35.582 --> 22:37.899
put old Ralph and Felix out the pastures

22:37.900 --> 22:39.336
..like my nana

They're gonna pull our plug

22:59.572 --> 23:03.276
Okay, everybody calm down..

23:03.277 --> 23:07.096

- Sugar Rush.

31:20.797 --> 31:23.580

31:38.483 --> 31:40.708
They don't know they're in a game
All they know is...

31:40.743 --> 31:44.510
eat, kill, multiply
Without a beacon to stop them

31:44.511 --> 31:48.126
..they'll consume Sugar Rush
- But you think they'll stop there?

31:48.226 --> 31:49.838
Yes!
- Wrong!

31:49.938 --> 31:52.522
Viruses do not stop

31:52.810 --> 31:55.362
Once those Cy-Bugs finish
off Sugar Rush..

31:55.393 --> 31:58.759
..they'll invade every other game
until this Arcade is..

31:58.794 --> 32:03.257

of forgotten dreams

32:03.957 --> 32:06.363

Sheepers, is she always this intense?
- It's not her fault

32:13.754 --> 32:17.204
She's programmed with
the most tragic backstory ever

32:17.494 --> 32:20.078
One day she didn't do a perimeter check

32:20.849 --> 32:22.638
Her wedding day

32:51.229 --> 32:54.949

The monster's been caught.

36:55.583 --> 37:01.844
We'll repair all the damage Don't worry we
will have our race before the Arcade opens

37:02.188 --> 37:04.103
And I'm in it

37:09.202 --> 37:12.680
There is no way that
I am racing with a glitch

37:12.780 --> 37:14.618
Francis, Candlehead, come on.

37:14.718 --> 37:19.264
Sour Bill, that glitch
cannot be allowed to race

37:19.279 --> 37:23.045
And bring that thing to my castle

37:45.460 --> 37:50.641
Sour Bill, detafify this monster
so we can see what we're up against here

37:51.319 --> 37:52.719
Mmmkay..

37:54.194 --> 37:56.766
Milk my duds, it's Wreck-It Ralph?

37:56.801 --> 37:59.500
Ya, who are you?
The guy that make the donuts?

37:59.535 --> 38:02.873
Please,... No!
I'm King Candy.

38:04.469 --> 38:06.288
I see you're a fan of pink

38:06.289 --> 38:08.107
- Salmon, salmon.. that
is obviously salm..

38:08.142 --> 38:09.698
What are you doing here?

38:09.733 --> 38:11.253
Look! Your candiness

38:11.680 --> 38:13.550
This is just a big misunderstanding

38:14.130 --> 38:17.497
Just get me out of this cupcake I'll get
my medal, and I'll be out of your way

38:17.532 --> 38:19.188
Your medal?

38:19.511 --> 38:22.021
Bad guys don't win medals

38:22.027 --> 38:25.188
Well, this one did!
I earned it over in.. Hero's Duty.

38:25.223 --> 38:29.217
You game jumped? Ralph!
You're not going Turbo, are you?

38:29.255 --> 38:31.636
What? No no no no..

38:31.637 --> 38:34.017
- Because if you think
you can come in here...

38:34.052 --> 38:36.413
to my kingdom and take over my game..
you've got another thing coming...

38:36.448 --> 38:38.353
Easy! Your Puffyness

38:38.453 --> 38:42.058
It's not my fault one of your children
of the candy corn stole my medal

38:42.093 --> 38:45.063
Children of the candy corn?
Who...?

38:45.163 --> 38:49.982
The glitch... the coin she used to buy her
way into the race, that was your medal?

38:49.988 --> 38:52.296
She did what?
I need that back

38:52.397 --> 38:54.978
Well, I'm afraid I can't help you,.
it's gone

38:54.979 --> 38:57.558
you know, it's.. it's
nothing but code now

38:58.123 --> 39:02.161
and it will stay that way until someone
wins the cup at the end of the race

39:02.428 --> 39:05.811
Well, maybe I'll just have to have
a little talk with the winner then

39:05.896 --> 39:07.762
Is that a threat I smell?

39:08.127 --> 39:12.276
Bwlaaah..beyond..halitosis is so
obviously you're suffering from

39:12.368 --> 39:15.935
Listen, nelly wafer, I'm not
leaving without my medal

39:16.053 --> 39:17.733
Yes, you are!

39:17.768 --> 39:20.617
Wynnchel, Duncan,
carry him out of that cupcake

39:20.717 --> 39:24.882
And on the first train back home And if I
ever see you here again Wreck-It Ralph...

39:25.668 --> 39:27.580
..I'll lock you in my Fungeon

39:27.865 --> 39:30.204
Fungeon?

39:30.205 --> 39:32.542
- Fun-dungeon? You know,
it's a play-on words?

39:32.760 --> 39:34.687
It's a Fu..
Never mind

39:34.787 --> 39:37.986
Now, I got a glitch to deal with
thanks to you

39:38.068 --> 39:41.802
Goodbye, Wreck-It Ralph.
It hasn't been a pleasure.

39:46.350 --> 39:48.314
It's hard as a rock
- I can see that

39:48.491 --> 39:49.835
Get the tools
- What tools?

39:49.870 --> 39:50.926
Quiet you!

39:52.710 --> 39:55.438
What?? No!
- Take it easy big boy

39:55.473 --> 39:57.351
Stay away from me
- He's getting away

40:02.506 --> 40:04.816
Quick, call out the Devil-dogs

40:21.963 --> 40:23.633
Chocolate I hate chocolate

40:25.359 --> 40:27.168
I gotta get my medal back

40:31.246 --> 40:33.423
The pot goes to the winning racer

40:33.524 --> 40:36.147
Hey kids, can I talk to you for a second?

40:46.389 --> 40:48.628
Hello, fellow racers

40:48.794 --> 40:51.003
It's that little crumb snatcher

40:51.099 --> 40:54.291
Candlehead, Taffyta, Rancis
you're looking well

40:54.326 --> 40:56.900
Came by to check out
the competition, huh?

40:56.935 --> 41:02.544
Well, here it is the Lickety Split
- Jeez, looks like she built it herself

41:02.549 --> 41:03.495
Built it myself

41:03.496 --> 41:07.308
Fastest pedal power west to
the Wack-a-Mole Check her out

41:11.678 --> 41:16.016
Oh..Vanellope
It's so.. you

41:16.117 --> 41:19.249
But.. you have to back out of the race

41:19.820 --> 41:23.222
Oh no, I.. I don't, you know
cause I..i paid my fee...

41:23.322 --> 41:26.658
and I'm on the board
So, ya.. I'm definitely racing

41:26.744 --> 41:29.700
Ya, well.. King Candy says
glitches can't race

41:29.735 --> 41:33.204
I'm not a glitch, Taffyta
Just got pixlexie, okay

41:33.471 --> 41:35.804
The rules are there for
a reason, Vanellope

41:35.839 --> 41:37.363
To protect us

41:37.392 --> 41:40.092
Say, I'm you..
I'm in my weird little car..

41:40.192 --> 41:44.199
and I'm driving and..
actually feel kinda cool for once..

41:44.234 --> 41:48.909
and then all of a sudden.. oh no..
I'm gli..gli..gli..gli... glitching

41:50.216 --> 41:52.713
See, you're an accident
just waiting to happen

41:52.714 --> 41:55.209
- Oh no, I gli..
gli..gli..gli..glitch too

41:55.551 --> 41:57.615
Oh hey hey, what are you doing?
- Uncool

41:58.081 --> 42:01.487
Stop. You're breaking it

42:02.441 --> 42:05.700
Please, I just wanna race like you guys

42:05.867 --> 42:09.464
You will never be a racer
because you're a glitch

42:09.499 --> 42:11.591
And that's all you'll ever be

42:13.230 --> 42:15.741
Hey.. leave her alone

42:18.613 --> 42:20.290
Let's get out of here

42:25.621 --> 42:29.336
Scram, you rotten little cavities
before I throw you in a mud

42:35.469 --> 42:37.552
What are you looking at?

42:38.354 --> 42:42.065
You're welcome, you rotten little thief
- I'm not a thief

42:42.188 --> 42:44.583
I just borrowed your
stupid coin I was gonna

42:44.584 --> 42:46.977
give it back to you as
soon as I won the race

42:47.030 --> 42:49.863
It's not a coin It is a medal

42:50.083 --> 42:54.176
Coin, medal.. whatever... just go back to
your own dumb game and win another one

42:54.177 --> 42:58.652
I can't, I didn't win it in my game
I won it in Hero's Duty.

42:59.070 --> 43:00.752
Hero's Duty?

43:03.253 --> 43:04.857
It's not that kind of duty

43:04.913 --> 43:09.376
I bet you really get a 'watch where you
step' in a game called Hero's Duty?

43:10.464 --> 43:12.992
What'd you won the medal for, wiping??

43:14.655 --> 43:17.609
I hope you wash your hands
after you handle that medal..

43:17.709 --> 43:18.987
Listen..
- One more, one more

43:19.023 --> 43:22.001
Why did the Hero flush the toilet?

43:22.250 --> 43:24.643
Say 'why?'
- Why?

43:24.678 --> 43:27.241
Because it was his 'duty'!

43:27.242 --> 43:29.804
- How dare you insult Hero's
Duty, you little girlsnipe!

43:29.839 --> 43:33.976
I earned that medal You better get
it back for me, too schweetz sister

43:34.077 --> 43:36.859
Well unless you've got
a go-cart hidden in

43:36.860 --> 43:39.640
the back-folds of your
neck, I can't help it

43:45.236 --> 43:47.449
What a moron...

43:47.484 --> 43:52.077
Hey, genius..that's a jaw-breaker
You're never gonna...

43:57.705 --> 44:02.032
Enjoy your little tantrum day, poor baby?
- Leave me alone

44:02.491 --> 44:04.807
Look, you want that medal, right?

44:04.988 --> 44:08.241
And I want a race
So, here's what I'm thinking

44:08.470 --> 44:11.284
You help me get a new cart a real cart

44:11.661 --> 44:14.460
and I'll win the race and get
you back your medal

44:14.568 --> 44:17.079
You want me..
to help you???

44:17.114 --> 44:19.905
All you gotta do is break
something for me...

44:19.952 --> 44:22.878
C'mon, what do you say, friend?

44:22.913 --> 44:24.573
We are not friends

44:24.607 --> 44:28.334
Oh. C'mon... pal
You son of a gun

44:28.488 --> 44:31.006
C'mon buddy Just shake on it

44:31.795 --> 44:36.170
Ah.. c'mon jumbo
Ralph my man.. my main man...

44:36.556 --> 44:41.134
Hey, my arms getting tired
We have a deal or not?

44:42.930 --> 44:44.652
You better win

44:47.908 --> 44:51.985
Well, I'll say this much... they don't
call your friend 'Wreck-it' for nothing

44:53.159 --> 44:54.136
There's the shuttle

44:58.326 --> 44:59.859
Is he in there?

44:59.988 --> 45:02.456
Nope. Lucky for him

45:02.556 --> 45:05.093
Otherwise, I would have slap his corpse

45:06.079 --> 45:08.018
No Cy-Bug either

45:08.053 --> 45:11.451
Gotta find it before it
lays it's filthy eggs

45:12.853 --> 45:17.343
He came this way but the Sugar particles
in the atmosphere are jamming my sensor

45:17.436 --> 45:19.032
Can't get a read on it

45:19.672 --> 45:21.142
So, what is it with this
Wreck-it joker, huh?

45:21.143 --> 45:22.612
Why'd he go AWOL?

45:23.040 --> 45:27.092
I wish I knew, ma'am
he was acting all squirely last night

45:27.127 --> 45:29.877
Going on about cake and medals

45:29.935 --> 45:32.442
But, I never thought he'd go Turbo!

45:32.477 --> 45:34.219
Go Turbo??

45:34.254 --> 45:36.959
That's right,
you guys just got plugged in

45:36.994 --> 45:39.966
Well, back when the Arcade first open

45:39.967 --> 45:42.937
TurboTime was by far the
most popular game...

45:42.992 --> 45:44.957
..and Turbo...
- Turbotastic.

45:45.023 --> 45:47.566
Well, he loved the attention..

45:47.685 --> 45:52.353
- Turbotastic
So, when Rogue Blaster got plugged in and

45:52.388 --> 45:54.071
stole Turbo's thunder
- New game

45:54.106 --> 45:56.909
- alright
...boy.. was he jealous.

45:56.944 --> 46:00.259
..so jealous that he abandoned..

46:00.347 --> 46:02.084
..his game

46:02.119 --> 46:03.678
..and try to take over the new one

46:03.679 --> 46:05.236
- These are the greatest
graphics I've ever seen

46:05.288 --> 46:08.266
Turbotastic
- Hey, is that..??

46:08.301 --> 46:12.256
That looks like Turbo.
- What's Turbo doing in this game?

46:12.317 --> 46:15.090
Oh, c'mon Mister Litwak

46:15.525 --> 46:21.158
Turbo ended up putting both games
and himself out of order

46:21.159 --> 46:22.951
...for good

46:23.052 --> 46:27.887
Yes, The selfish man is like a mangy dog
chasing its own cautionary tail

46:27.922 --> 46:29.963
I know..right?

46:30.198 --> 46:34.883
That's why I have to get Ralph home or
the same thing's gonna happen to my game

46:38.927 --> 46:40.558
Ungh... Oh
- What is this?

46:41.486 --> 46:42.700
Nesquicksand?

46:42.735 --> 46:45.031
Quicksand

46:45.066 --> 46:47.932
Oh, I'll hop out and
grab you one of those vines

46:52.512 --> 46:54.690
I can't hop
I'm hop-less

46:54.890 --> 46:57.309
This is hopeless We're gonna drown here

46:57.405 --> 47:01.197
Stop draking, stop..stop moving
You're making us sink faster

47:01.232 --> 47:03.187
- We're gonna die..
Get a hold of yourself

47:07.051 --> 47:09.607
Ah, the vines They are Laffy Taffy.

47:09.683 --> 47:12.053
They're attracted to whatever
makes them laugh

47:12.273 --> 47:13.942
Here, hit me again

47:17.751 --> 47:20.241
That's not funny enough Harder.

47:20.276 --> 47:22.445
Look, you're a nice guy I can't...

47:22.446 --> 47:24.613
- No, ma'am.. the Arcade
is depending on us

47:24.713 --> 47:27.767
Now do your duty That's an or..

47:30.592 --> 47:32.592
It's working..
Hit me again

47:32.617 --> 47:34.617
Oooh.. your eye..

47:34.670 --> 47:36.365
I can fix it

47:36.553 --> 47:38.180
Now go....

47:38.403 --> 47:40.230
Fra..fantastic

47:40.373 --> 47:41.582
Again

47:42.059 --> 47:43.881
You mean business..

47:49.438 --> 47:51.223
Killing

48:07.600 --> 48:10.700
s u b by:
m a X e e r ( M C )

48:19.491 --> 48:23.289
Alright, enought with the goo-goo eyes
We've got work to do, let's go

48:25.723 --> 48:27.366
Ungh!.. lost the Cy-Bug

48:27.545 --> 48:29.304
C'mon, we'll get a better
view from the air

48:29.339 --> 48:30.966
You think you can fix that shuttle?

48:31.497 --> 48:33.654
Can do

48:57.891 --> 48:59.616
Alright, do your thing
knuckles, bust it open

48:59.617 --> 49:01.340
- What's this?

49:01.540 --> 49:03.129
You're a full-on criminal, aren't you?

49:03.164 --> 49:05.466
hey, we shook on it

49:08.915 --> 49:10.699
Thank you, jeeps

49:12.369 --> 49:15.323
What is this place?
Where are the carts?

49:15.356 --> 49:17.746
We gotta make one
- What? No no no no.

49:17.846 --> 49:20.627
Look kid, bad idea
Trust me, I don't make things

49:20.727 --> 49:21.851
I break things

49:21.852 --> 49:25.542
Well, looks like you're gonna be stepping
outside your comfort zone then, gladius

49:26.069 --> 49:27.471
Ooh, this is a good one

49:27.811 --> 49:31.370
Welcome to the Bakery.
Let's bake a cart

49:31.405 --> 49:34.496
What is this? Another game?
- Ya, well.. it's a mini game

49:34.596 --> 49:36.788
You have one minute to win it

49:36.823 --> 49:39.427
C'mon, Ralph.
- Now..Mixing.

49:39.462 --> 49:42.906
Put the ingredients in the bowl
and throw away the trash

49:42.941 --> 49:44.369
Hairbrush..

49:44.376 --> 49:46.185
Underpants..

Afterall, I'll do it

49:53.389 --> 49:55.798
Urgh!..Gross

Bever up!

50:03.377 --> 50:05.734
C'mon, no sleeping on the job

50:05.769 --> 50:07.321
Baking

50:07.356 --> 50:10.971
Pump up the head and hold
the perfect temperature

50:11.337 --> 50:13.483
A little help here
- I'm on it

50:15.135 --> 50:16.600
Ralph!??

50:16.601 --> 50:18.065
- Yup, no bother.. I just...
- Give me this thing.

50:19.818 --> 50:23.564
Ok, good.. little more
Hold it, hold it

50:27.578 --> 50:31.098
C'mon get up Ralph.. 15 seconds

50:31.133 --> 50:32.347
Wheels first
- How many?

50:32.447 --> 50:33.902
Four, doink

50:35.321 --> 50:39.149
Now frosting, a butt load of frosting
- No problem

50:51.264 --> 50:52.924
Time's up!

50:52.959 --> 50:57.598
Congratulation you did it
and here's your cart

51:07.237 --> 51:09.147
Look, kid...

51:10.198 --> 51:11.877
I tried to warn you

51:11.912 --> 51:16.287
I..i can't make things, I just... break
- I love it!

51:16.569 --> 51:18.182
You do?

51:18.244 --> 51:21.955
I love it!
I love it, I love it, I love it

51:21.990 --> 51:25.120
Look, it's got a real engine
and look at these wheels

51:26.873 --> 51:29.834
I love it I finally have a real cart

51:30.479 --> 51:34.887
C'mon, a work of art like this
must be signed

51:45.427 --> 51:48.283
This is Beard Papa.
The glitch is in the Bakery.

51:48.318 --> 51:50.164
Get me King Candy.

51:54.815 --> 51:59.839
Well, what?? you have teeth? I don't
think I've ever seen you smile before

52:00.058 --> 52:01.472
I'm not smiling it was...

52:02.052 --> 52:04.179
I'm gassy.. okay

52:05.475 --> 52:08.276
Hold it right there, glitch

52:08.496 --> 52:10.116
And Wreck-It Ralph?

52:12.343 --> 52:14.830
Start the cart start the cart...

52:15.150 --> 52:17.216
- I.....
What are you waiting for? c'mon let's go

52:18.265 --> 52:21.494
I..uh.. I ..don't know how
to drive a real cart

52:21.529 --> 52:23.305
You don't...
What!?

52:23.340 --> 52:26.983
Are you hurt, sire?
- No, he just glazed me

52:27.018 --> 52:29.654
Get them
- Gain way

52:33.990 --> 52:35.651
Stop in the name of the king

52:35.654 --> 52:37.158
..that's me

52:41.681 --> 52:43.302
Get off the road

52:48.110 --> 52:50.668
Head for Diet Cola Mountain.

52:53.800 --> 52:55.619
Drive into the wall..
- What?

52:55.654 --> 52:57.540
Right there between the
two sugar-free lollipops

52:57.541 --> 52:59.425
- Are you crazy?

52:59.526 --> 53:01.051
Just do it

53:12.810 --> 53:14.155
Where'd they go?

53:14.268 --> 53:16.286
Maybe.. they've just turned..

53:17.798 --> 53:20.943
Find that glitch destroy that cart

53:20.978 --> 53:23.742
She can't be allowed to race

53:28.103 --> 53:29.720
So let me get this straight

53:29.931 --> 53:32.194
You don't know how to drive

53:32.229 --> 53:35.280
Well no, not technically
But I just thought that...

53:35.380 --> 53:38.114
What did you think? Oh.. I
just I'll just magically

53:38.115 --> 53:40.847
win the race just because
I really want to

53:40.848 --> 53:45.151
Look wise guy, I know I'm a
racer, I can feel it in my cone

53:46.769 --> 53:49.453
That's it..!
I'm never getting my medal back

53:49.617 --> 53:52.702
What is the big whoop about
that crummy medal, anyway?

53:52.703 --> 53:55.787
- The big whoop, well this
may come as a shock to you..

53:55.887 --> 54:00.069
but in my game, I'm the bad guy
and I live in the garbage

54:00.104 --> 54:04.786
Cool... - No, not cool
Unhygenic and lonely and boring

54:04.886 --> 54:08.742
And that crummy medal
was gonna change all that

54:08.777 --> 54:12.017
I go home with that
baby around my neck then I'll get a

54:12.026 --> 54:16.254
penthouse, pies,
ice sculptures, fireworks

54:17.414 --> 54:19.166
It's grown up stuffs,
you wouldn't understand

54:19.167 --> 54:20.917
- No, I get it

54:21.397 --> 54:23.892
That's exactly what racing
would do for me

54:23.927 --> 54:25.376
Well, guess what?
- What?

54:25.476 --> 54:28.619
News flash..neither one of us
is getting what we want

54:31.347 --> 54:32.615
What was that?

54:45.374 --> 54:47.763
Diet Cola Hot Springs

54:47.799 --> 54:51.517
Watch out for falling Mentos
- Ya, check it out, look

54:59.584 --> 55:02.660
Oh, you gotta watch out for the splash
That stuff is boiling hot

55:02.695 --> 55:04.863
Ya, I got that thank you

55:05.433 --> 55:07.099
What is this dump?

55:07.134 --> 55:10.609
I think it's some sort of
unfinished bonus level

55:10.962 --> 55:12.832
Ya, it's pretty cool, huh?

55:12.954 --> 55:16.209
I found that secret opening
and now I live here

55:16.777 --> 55:18.343
See, oh look look look look

55:18.961 --> 55:20.975
Welcome to my home

55:21.762 --> 55:24.439
I sleep in these candy wrappers I like

55:24.440 --> 55:27.116
bundling myself up like
a little homeless lady

55:28.289 --> 55:30.344
By yourself?

55:30.772 --> 55:32.729
With all these garbage around here?

55:33.565 --> 55:35.692
Well, ya

55:35.727 --> 55:37.808
I mean, everyone here
says I'm just the mistake

55:37.809 --> 55:39.888
and that I wasn't even suppose to exist

55:39.924 --> 55:41.683
What do you expect?

55:41.706 --> 55:43.251
Listen kid..

55:43.963 --> 55:46.521
I know it's none of my business

55:46.557 --> 55:49.057
but why do you even stick
around this game

55:49.350 --> 55:51.758
You really don't know anything, do you?

55:51.793 --> 55:54.165
Glitches can't leave their games

55:55.692 --> 55:58.569
It's one of the joyous of being me

56:07.248 --> 56:09.378
Hey, what are you doing?
C'mon..

56:09.973 --> 56:12.454
I know it's a dump but it's all I got

56:12.489 --> 56:15.494
If you're gonna be a racer,
then, you'll have to learn how to drive

56:15.535 --> 56:17.145
You can't do that...

56:17.480 --> 56:18.846
without a track

56:24.153 --> 56:25.514
Alright now..

56:25.601 --> 56:28.211
Let's hustle up, we got
some driving to do

56:28.212 --> 56:30.821
- No wonder I'm driving..I'm gonna
learn to drive.. I'm gonna..

56:30.822 --> 56:33.940
Oh wait, do you know how to drive?
- Ya, I mean, I haven't done it but...

56:33.975 --> 56:35.634
look, I flew a spaceship today okay

56:35.669 --> 56:38.896
You crashed it
- Just get in, how hard can it be? okay

56:39.071 --> 56:40.752
Uh.. start it up

56:43.335 --> 56:44.886
There you go

56:45.026 --> 56:47.638
So there's some buttons on the floor
- Pedals

56:47.673 --> 56:50.520
Pedals, right!
Now.. uh..

56:51.427 --> 56:53.866
Thats the 'go' pedal

56:53.901 --> 56:57.997
That, I believe is the stopper

56:58.208 --> 57:01.238
And this... wait

57:01.273 --> 57:03.224
What is this?
It doesn't do anything

57:03.555 --> 57:05.201
Woo, what's this joystick do?

57:06.242 --> 57:08.600
Okay, good.
Let's try that again

57:41.351 --> 57:44.446
That's good, keep going Shift it again

57:49.727 --> 57:52.645
I told you Racing's in my cone

57:55.529 --> 57:59.721
Is that little not the best?
- Hey you Ralphy, watch this

58:13.360 --> 58:15.002
Look out!

58:31.480 --> 58:33.195
So, how did I do?

58:34.162 --> 58:37.092
Well, you almost blew
up the whole mountain

58:37.635 --> 58:39.375
Righ right, that's a good note

58:39.410 --> 58:41.406
You gotta get that
glitch under control kid

58:41.441 --> 58:43.114
Ok, I will I will and..

58:43.853 --> 58:46.216
And then, you think I get a chance?

58:49.004 --> 58:49.975
Tiny

58:50.181 --> 58:53.577
Yes, I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win I'm
gonna win, I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win

58:53.612 --> 58:55.260
Top shelf
- Top shelf

59:08.136 --> 59:10.228
Did you find the..?
Tell me you found her..

59:11.949 --> 59:13.495
You didn't?

59:15.856 --> 59:17.966
Go, leave me.

59:39.500 --> 59:41.500
Up up down dwon..
hmm hmm.. hih ..hih

59:43.726 --> 59:45.470
Start.

59:47.468 --> 59:51.506
Oh.. Code
That's the sweet lifeblood of the game

59:57.570 --> 59:59.531
Where are you?

59:59.566 --> 01:00:03.042
The Stadium, no.
Jumbotrons

01:00:03.078 --> 01:00:04.567
Ahah!
There it is

01:00:04.894 --> 01:00:06.559
The winner's cup

01:00:08.032 --> 01:00:11.600
One of these things is not like
the others... it's you

01:00:11.635 --> 01:00:14.474
We're gonna give you a nice new home

01:00:26.432 --> 01:00:27.954
Success

01:00:29.602 --> 01:00:34.156
Sour Bill, I'm going out, you're in charge
of the castle until I get back

01:00:45.336 --> 01:00:48.904
Your face is still red, you might
wanna hit it again with your hammer

01:00:48.939 --> 01:00:51.739
Oh, that's not blood force trauma ma'am

01:00:51.756 --> 01:00:53.904
That's just the honey glow in my cheeks

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:58.642
Okay..
- Ma'am, I just gotta tell ya

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:02.789
You are one dynamite gal..

01:01:04.253 --> 01:01:08.166
Wow..
You are one dynamite gal..

01:01:08.639 --> 01:01:11.030
One dynamite gal

01:01:11.317 --> 01:01:14.739
Dynamite gal

01:01:14.764 --> 01:01:16.764
Dynamite....

01:01:21.053 --> 01:01:22.427
Get out

01:01:22.462 --> 01:01:26.014
All I said is you're a dynamite gal?
- I said get out

01:01:33.735 --> 01:01:36.700
Oh.. jimanny jamanny

01:01:42.801 --> 01:01:44.948
Yes

01:01:45.934 --> 01:01:50.563
I'm Fix-It Felix Jr, sir
from the game Fix-It Felix Jr.

01:01:50.575 --> 01:01:53.925
Have you seen my friend Ralph?
- Wreck-It Ralph?

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.421
Yes, yes that's him

01:01:55.456 --> 01:01:58.695
Should've lock him up
when we had the chance

01:01:58.956 --> 01:02:03.313
Lock him up?
- Not making the same mistake with you

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:10.545
Hurry hurry, let's go
time's a wastin' ..c'mon Ralph

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:14.159
This is it, this is really happening
I almost don't believe it

01:02:14.194 --> 01:02:17.442
I mean, I have dreamt about it
for so long and now..

01:02:17.478 --> 01:02:20.500
and now.. now I think I'm gonna
puke actually, I think I might puke

01:02:20.535 --> 01:02:22.183
You know, like a 'vurp'

01:02:22.218 --> 01:02:23.959
A what?
- Vomit and a burp together

01:02:23.994 --> 01:02:28.229
and you can taste it, and it's just
like rising up Oh this is so exciting

01:02:28.264 --> 01:02:30.290
Yes, it is, it's exciting

01:02:30.325 --> 01:02:32.342
I mean am I ready to be a real racer?

01:02:32.377 --> 01:02:34.428
Ralph, what if the gamers don't like me?

01:02:34.492 --> 01:02:36.279
Who doesn't love a brat with dirty hair?

01:02:37.327 --> 01:02:40.354
C'mon Those people are gonna love you

01:02:40.574 --> 01:02:43.163
You know why?
Cause you're a winner

01:02:43.198 --> 01:02:45.495
A winner
- And you're adorable

01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:49.401
I'm adorable
- And everyone loves an adorable winner

01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:54.269
Okay, c'mon
Listen to me, if you get nervous

01:02:54.304 --> 01:02:59.970
just keep telling yourslef 'I must win
Ralph's medal or his life will be ruined'

01:02:59.993 --> 01:03:02.814
And have fun, got it?
- Got it!

01:03:03.912 --> 01:03:07.872
Oh wait!
Hold on..

01:03:07.907 --> 01:03:11.047
Where you going?
- I forgot something, I'll be right back

01:03:13.672 --> 01:03:15.527
Kids

01:03:16.688 --> 01:03:19.561
Ralph, there you are, hello
- Huh??

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:22.434
You!!
- No no, I come alone, unarmed

01:03:23.121 --> 01:03:26.905
I've had enough of you, pillow pants
- Calm down, please

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:30.491
I'm gonna beat the hella out of you

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:32.511
You wouldn't hit a guy with
glasses, would you?

01:03:33.233 --> 01:03:35.976
You hit a guy with glasses, that's..

01:03:36.011 --> 01:03:38.888
well played
- What do you want Candy?

01:03:38.924 --> 01:03:40.866
Listen, I just wanna talk to you

01:03:40.901 --> 01:03:43.832
I'm not intrested in anything
you have to say

01:03:43.867 --> 01:03:47.863
But how about this?
Are you interested... in this?

01:03:47.879 --> 01:03:51.327
My medal..how did you..??
- It doesn't matter

01:03:51.362 --> 01:03:54.008
here, it's yours Go ahead and take it

01:03:57.608 --> 01:04:00.022
All I ask is that you hear me out

01:04:00.054 --> 01:04:02.243
About what?

01:04:02.278 --> 01:04:06.032
Ralph, do you know what the hardest
part about being a king is?

01:04:06.367 --> 01:04:08.116
Doing what's right

01:04:08.151 --> 01:04:10.180
No matter what
- Get to the point

01:04:10.215 --> 01:04:11.933
Point being I need your help

01:04:12.375 --> 01:04:17.361
Sad as it is,
Vanellope cannot be allowed to race

01:04:17.396 --> 01:04:21.054
Why are you people so against her?
- I'm not against her..

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:25.151
I'm trying to protect her.
If Vanellope wins that race..

01:04:25.186 --> 01:04:27.896
she'll be added to the race roster

01:04:27.899 --> 01:04:31.481
Then gamers can choose
the racer's avatar

01:04:32.416 --> 01:04:36.964
And when they see her glitching and then
get glitching in just being herself

01:04:37.015 --> 01:04:39.617
They'll think our game is broken

01:04:39.961 --> 01:04:42.291
We'll be put ourt of order for good

01:04:43.365 --> 01:04:46.024
All my subjects will be homeless

01:04:47.788 --> 01:04:51.759
But there is one who cannot escape
because she's a glitch

01:04:51.794 --> 01:04:54.874
Help.
Somebody help me..

01:04:54.909 --> 01:04:57.480
When the game's plug is pulled

01:04:59.847 --> 01:05:02.386
she'll die with it

01:05:03.182 --> 01:05:05.279
You don't know that will happen

01:05:05.314 --> 01:05:09.315
The gamers could love her
- And if they don't?

01:05:15.958 --> 01:05:21.695
I know it's tough, but heroes have
to make the tough choices, don't they?

01:05:21.977 --> 01:05:25.385
She can't race Ralph but...

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.383
She won't listen to me

01:05:27.427 --> 01:05:31.713
So, can I count on you to
talk a little sense into her?

01:05:33.578 --> 01:05:38.122
Very good
Uh.. I'll give you two some time alone

01:06:04.462 --> 01:06:06.218
I'm back..

01:06:06.785 --> 01:06:09.279
Did you miss me?
- Yea..Uh..

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.742
Hey, can we talk for a second?
- Wait, first kneel down

01:06:14.747 --> 01:06:17.391
What? no no. w.we really..
- You just do it!

01:06:17.516 --> 01:06:19.016
Okay

01:06:19.889 --> 01:06:22.453
Now, close your eyes

01:06:22.493 --> 01:06:24.030
Vanellope..
- Shut.. close them

01:06:28.339 --> 01:06:30.820
Okay, open them up

01:06:32.235 --> 01:06:35.350
To Stinkbrain Jee, thanks

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:38.927
Turn it over "YOURE MY HERO"

01:06:38.962 --> 01:06:42.637
I made it for you
Just in case we don't win

01:06:42.675 --> 01:06:46.367
Not that I think there's even a
remote chance we're not gonna win

01:06:46.494 --> 01:06:51.957
Thanks kid..Uhmm, listen
- Now.. rise, my royal champ

01:06:51.992 --> 01:06:54.468
I've got a date with destiny

01:06:54.503 --> 01:06:57.353
Ralph, c'mon move your molases

01:06:58.507 --> 01:07:01.539
Uh, I've been thinking
- That's dangerous

01:07:01.574 --> 01:07:04.704
Who cares about this
stupid race anyway? Right?

01:07:04.739 --> 01:07:07.936
That's not very funny, Ralph
- No, I'm serious and..uh..

01:07:08.128 --> 01:07:11.657
It was really fun to build the cart
and everything but.. maybe..

01:07:11.692 --> 01:07:15.679
maybe, you shouldn't do it
- Uh.. Hello? Is Ralph in there?

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:17.912
I'd like to speak to him please

01:07:17.913 --> 01:07:20.125
- Look what I'm saying
is, you can't be a racer

01:07:20.344 --> 01:07:24.059
What?
why would you..

01:07:24.659 --> 01:07:27.169
Wait a minute..

01:07:27.392 --> 01:07:29.812
No.
- Where did you get this?

01:07:30.161 --> 01:07:33.624
Look, I'm gonna be straight with you kid,
I've been talking to King Candy..

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:37.117
King Candy? You sold me out?
- Yea

01:07:37.118 --> 01:07:39.268
No, I didn't..
Listen, you don't understand

01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:41.590
No I understand, plunny traitor!

01:07:41.625 --> 01:07:44.194
I'm not a traitor, listen..
- You're a rat

01:07:44.229 --> 01:07:47.622
and I don't need you
and I can win the race on my own

01:07:47.657 --> 01:07:51.336
But I'm trying to save your skin, kid
- Put me down, let me go..

01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:54.546
No, you listen to me, you know whats gonna
happen when the players see you glitching

01:07:54.581 --> 01:07:57.625
They're gonna think the game's broken
- I don't care, you're a liar

01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.985
Yo, you better care because if your game
goes out of order

01:08:00.021 --> 01:08:01.711
you go down with the
ship later, thats true

01:08:01.712 --> 01:08:03.401
- I'm not listening to
you, get out of my way

01:08:03.734 --> 01:08:06.134
I'm going to that race
- No, you're not

01:08:07.818 --> 01:08:10.941
Take me down from here, Ralph... right now
- No

01:08:11.370 --> 01:08:13.578
I'm doing this for your own good

01:08:15.468 --> 01:08:17.578
Wait, wait wait

01:08:18.081 --> 01:08:22.336
No.. no.. no no no no
Please Ralph...

01:08:22.371 --> 01:08:25.567
No....
Stop it! ..Stop it...

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:28.765
No...

01:08:43.666 --> 01:08:46.991
You really are a bad guy

01:09:21.389 --> 01:09:24.725
Hello, anybody home?

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.295
Felix..
Mary..

01:09:27.321 --> 01:09:33.211
Well, you actually went and did it
- Gene, where is everybody?

01:09:33.537 --> 01:09:38.316
They're gone, after Felix went to find you
and then didn't come back

01:09:38.642 --> 01:09:40.898
Everyone panicked and abandon ship

01:09:40.933 --> 01:09:44.827
But.. but, I'm here now?
- It's too late, Ralph

01:09:45.421 --> 01:09:47.786
Litwak's pulling our plug in the morning

01:09:59.047 --> 01:10:03.293
But, never let it be said that
I'm not a man of my word

01:10:03.421 --> 01:10:06.754
The place is yours, Ralph.
Enjoy.

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:11.446
Gene, wait, wait

01:10:12.055 --> 01:10:14.816
Listen, this is not what I wanted

01:10:14.907 --> 01:10:19.594
Well, what did you want, Ralph?
- I don't know.. I.. I just

01:10:22.513 --> 01:10:25.807
I was just tired of living alone
in the garbage

01:10:26.849 --> 01:10:30.259
Well now, you can live alone
in the Penthouse

01:11:37.025 --> 01:11:40.368
Hey cough-drop,
explain something to me

01:11:40.403 --> 01:11:42.925
If Vanellope was never meant to exist...

01:11:43.038 --> 01:11:46.014
then why is her picture on
the side of the game console?

01:11:50.095 --> 01:11:53.930
What's going on in this candy coated
hearted darkness? -Nothing...

01:11:53.965 --> 01:11:55.680
Talk.. - No
I'll lick you..

01:11:55.863 --> 01:11:57.225
You wouldn't
- Oh yea?

01:11:58.971 --> 01:12:00.979
That's like sand-paper

01:12:01.537 --> 01:12:04.560
Wonder how many licks it will take
to get to your centre?

01:12:04.595 --> 01:12:07.608
Well, say that to my grave..
- Fair enough!

01:12:10.829 --> 01:12:13.403
They call you Sour Bill for a reason

01:12:14.058 --> 01:12:17.551
Had it enough yet?
- Okay okay, I'll talk, I'll talk.

01:12:17.586 --> 01:12:21.794
Vanellope was a racer until
King Candy try to delete her code

01:12:21.829 --> 01:12:25.485
Try to delete her code?
So, that's why she's a glitch

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.194
Why is he doing this to her?
- I don't know.

01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:31.865
Suit yourself
- No no no, I swear I don't know

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:35.822
He literally locked up our memory
and I cannot remember

01:12:35.823 --> 01:12:38.850
Nobody can But, I do know this..

01:12:38.885 --> 01:12:43.360
He'll do anything to keep her from racing
because if she crosses the finish line...

01:12:43.529 --> 01:12:46.661
the game will reset
and she won't be a glitch anymore

01:12:46.697 --> 01:12:48.309
Where is she now?

01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:49.920
- In the Fungeon with Fix-It Felix.
- Felix??

01:12:49.955 --> 01:12:52.411
I'm sorry, that's all I know
that's all I know, I swear

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:56.831
No please don't put me back
in your filthy mouth again

01:12:58.949 --> 01:13:03.625
Stick around
- Yes, okay I will, I will.. thank you

01:13:07.222 --> 01:13:09.005
C'mon I know you're out there

01:13:10.201 --> 01:13:13.519
Saccharin saturated nightmare

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.531
Where?

01:13:34.847 --> 01:13:39.850
Doomsday and Armageddon just had
a baby, and it is ugly

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:46.522
Hello, hello... somebody?
Anybody?

01:13:46.523 --> 01:13:49.155
Please let me out

01:13:49.988 --> 01:13:54.296
What is that.. what he says...?
I'm gonna wreck it

01:13:57.533 --> 01:14:00.817
Why do I fix everything I touch?

01:14:04.596 --> 01:14:08.320
Felix
- Ralph, I'm so glad to see you

01:14:08.882 --> 01:14:12.643
No, wait.. I'm not
What do you have to say for yourself?

01:14:12.678 --> 01:14:15.811
Wait, I don't want to hear
I'm not talking to you

01:14:15.846 --> 01:14:17.397
Okay, don't talk That's fine

01:14:17.432 --> 01:14:19.427
But you have to fix this go-cart
for me pronto

01:14:19.527 --> 01:14:22.964
I don't have to do boo
Forgive my potty mouth

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.995
I'm just so..
so crossed with you

01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:28.375
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

01:14:28.410 --> 01:14:31.314
I were in Hickelty pickelty
all over creation looking

01:14:31.315 --> 01:14:34.218
for you, I almost drowned
in chocolate milk mix

01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:38.072
And then, I met the most dynamite gal

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:41.845
Oh.. she gives me the
honey glow, something aweful

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:47.161
But, she rebuff my affections
And then, I got thrown in jail

01:14:47.196 --> 01:14:48.696
Felix, pull yourself together

01:14:48.731 --> 01:14:54.086
No, Ralph you don't know what it's like to
be rejected and treated like a criminal

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:57.755
Yes, I do That's everyday in my life

01:14:58.386 --> 01:15:01.171
It is?
- Which is why I ran off

01:15:01.206 --> 01:15:03.373
I try to be a good guy but I'm not

01:15:03.408 --> 01:15:06.386
Just a bad guy and I need your help

01:15:06.421 --> 01:15:08.557
There's a little girl
whose only hope is this cart

01:15:08.592 --> 01:15:10.505
Please, Felix fix it

01:15:10.933 --> 01:15:14.116
And I promise I will never try
to be good again

01:15:37.654 --> 01:15:40.220
I know, I know, I know I'm an idiot

01:15:40.686 --> 01:15:43.927
And?
- and a real Numbskull

01:15:43.962 --> 01:15:46.933
And?
- a selfish diaper baby.

01:15:46.968 --> 01:15:51.351
And?
- and.. a Stinkbrain.

01:15:51.386 --> 01:15:54.537
The stinkiest brain ever

01:16:16.696 --> 01:16:22.031
My sweet subjects, I came without a
flinch of hesitation to show you

01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:25.016
that I have never been
so happy in all my life

01:16:25.051 --> 01:16:27.323
to say the following words

01:16:27.554 --> 01:16:31.234
Let the Random Roster Race commence

01:16:47.767 --> 01:16:50.743
Okay, remember.. you don't
have to win Just cross

01:16:50.744 --> 01:16:53.718
that finish line and
you'll be a real racer

01:16:53.806 --> 01:16:55.723
I'm already a real racer

01:16:58.292 --> 01:17:00.544
And I'm gonna win

01:17:23.769 --> 01:17:25.299
Power Up.

01:17:32.847 --> 01:17:35.010
Oh..
A La Mode.

01:17:38.707 --> 01:17:40.757
Sweet Seekers.

01:17:40.912 --> 01:17:43.214
Have some candy

01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:05.140
Behind you..
Infront of you..

01:18:12.049 --> 01:18:15.203
It's the glitch
- The glitch

01:18:15.239 --> 01:18:17.705
Light 'em up Candlehead

01:18:20.454 --> 01:18:23.741
What's this?
Cherry Bomb.

01:18:30.407 --> 01:18:33.582
I told you
You're just an accident waiting to happen

01:18:51.069 --> 01:18:52.876
My candle...

01:18:53.668 --> 01:18:56.429
Alright, gotta keep it under control

01:18:56.491 --> 01:18:58.645
No more glitching

01:18:59.342 --> 01:19:02.822
Okay kid, let's finish this thing
without any more surprises

01:19:03.717 --> 01:19:05.936
Hope you're happy jump-pile

01:19:05.971 --> 01:19:08.953
This game is going down and
it's all your fault

01:19:08.988 --> 01:19:11.657
My lady, you came back
- Canned it, Fix-It.

01:19:11.811 --> 01:19:14.797
That Cy-Bug you brought with you
multiplied

01:19:14.832 --> 01:19:18.075
No, it died in the taffy swamp
believe me

01:19:20.531 --> 01:19:23.020
You're wrong!

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:33.125
Listen up people,
head to Game Central Station, now..

01:19:33.247 --> 01:19:35.224
Move it let's go let's go

01:19:45.142 --> 01:19:46.813
No

01:20:27.535 --> 01:20:32.795
Get off of my track
- hey, what are you crazy?

01:20:33.394 --> 01:20:38.408
I forbid you to cross that finish line

01:20:39.585 --> 01:20:42.202
Knock it out

01:20:43.345 --> 01:20:47.788
Ralph, look
- Kid...

01:20:49.618 --> 01:20:54.451
No, Stop it. - Let me.. urgh!!
- Not letting you undo all my hard work

01:20:56.672 --> 01:20:58.797
Is that....

01:21:00.281 --> 01:21:02.783
No way....

01:21:03.652 --> 01:21:07.408
What the... Who are you??
- I'm Turbo

01:21:07.447 --> 01:21:09.807
The greatest racer ever

01:21:09.992 --> 01:21:13.071
And I did not reprogram
this world to let you

01:21:13.106 --> 01:21:17.897
and that holocust riddled warhock
take it away from me

01:21:19.449 --> 01:21:21.046
Turbotastic

01:21:21.471 --> 01:21:24.136
End of the line, glitch

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:27.469
Glitch. That's it

01:21:27.569 --> 01:21:30.904
C'mon, Vanellope. I know you said
you wouldn't do it again...

01:21:30.939 --> 01:21:35.692
But you're gonna do it one more time
Just focus and concentrate

01:21:35.727 --> 01:21:39.302
And..
Glitch.

01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:41.839
No

01:21:42.808 --> 01:21:47.606
Sweet mother of monkey milk I did it

01:21:47.792 --> 01:21:50.041
No

01:21:54.833 --> 01:21:58.370
Bring it home kid
The finish line's wide open

01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:15.161
No

01:22:15.502 --> 01:22:17.072
Kid, kid are you okay?

01:22:17.107 --> 01:22:19.453
I'm fine, I'm fine
Let's finish this race

01:22:24.313 --> 01:22:27.391
Oh my randd!!
- Alright C'mon we gotta get out of here

01:22:27.426 --> 01:22:31.057
But I didn't cross the finish line
- There is no finish line

01:22:31.782 --> 01:22:34.460
Move it or lose it people
c'mon everybody out now

01:22:36.774 --> 01:22:39.449
Ralph, it's not gonna work
- We gotta try

01:22:43.651 --> 01:22:45.949
Kid
- Ralph I told you I can't leave the game

01:22:46.516 --> 01:22:48.852
C'mon
- Ralph, just stop

01:22:49.643 --> 01:22:53.351
It's gotta work
- Stop, it's no use

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:04.283
It's okay, Ralph.

01:23:05.677 --> 01:23:09.240
Alright Fix-It, that's everyone
now we gotta blow up this exit

01:23:11.757 --> 01:23:14.243
Just go, go without me

01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:17.619
What about this game?
- Nothing we can do about it

01:23:17.654 --> 01:23:21.782
Without a beacon, there's no way
to stop these monsters

01:23:25.045 --> 01:23:28.799
Beacon..
stay with Felix

01:23:29.237 --> 01:23:32.122
Let me borrow that thing lady
- Ralph, where are you going?

01:23:32.157 --> 01:23:34.258
I got some wrecking to do

01:23:34.357 --> 01:23:37.088
I'll meet you at the finish line
- No, wait

01:23:37.123 --> 01:23:39.104
Fix-It, get behind me

01:23:58.805 --> 01:24:00.383
One more..

01:24:02.664 --> 01:24:06.343
Welcome to the Boss Level
- Turbo.

01:24:07.137 --> 01:24:13.949
Because of you, Ralph, I'm now
the most powerful virus in the Arcade

01:24:14.363 --> 01:24:16.333
I can take over any game I want

01:24:16.368 --> 01:24:20.773
I should thank you
but.. it'd be more fun to kill you

01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:25.074
Get back here little guy

01:24:33.439 --> 01:24:35.472
Where do you think you're going?

01:24:39.854 --> 01:24:42.072
I'm not through with you yet

01:24:42.107 --> 01:24:44.290
Up we go
- No

01:24:50.319 --> 01:24:53.024
Fall back

01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:56.433
Kid

01:25:02.404 --> 01:25:04.593
Look at that, it's your little friend

01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:08.460
Let's watch her die together, shall we

01:25:08.569 --> 01:25:10.536
No

01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:15.623
It's game over for both of you
- No

01:25:16.181 --> 01:25:18.704
Just for me

01:25:27.259 --> 01:25:30.266
I'm bad, and that's good

01:25:30.943 --> 01:25:34.070
I will never be good and that's not bad

01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:42.309
There's no one I'd rather be..
..than me

01:26:09.982 --> 01:26:14.031
Kid
- Don't worry, I got it under control

01:26:39.631 --> 01:26:43.958
Why are you going into the light...

01:26:44.467 --> 01:26:49.889
No, no..
Yea.

01:26:51.126 --> 01:26:54.834
Go into the light

01:27:01.848 --> 01:27:06.696
Chocolate, it's chocolate
I love chocolate

01:27:07.134 --> 01:27:10.566
Beautiful chocolate

01:27:11.312 --> 01:27:15.180
You did it, Ralph.
Oh..Way to go brother

01:27:21.292 --> 01:27:23.894
I'm... es..

01:27:29.382 --> 01:27:32.514
All fixed
- You ready for this?

01:27:32.549 --> 01:27:34.644
Ready as I'll ever be

01:27:43.367 --> 01:27:46.242
Look at all the magic sparkles

01:28:16.251 --> 01:28:18.657
Now, I remember

01:28:19.632 --> 01:28:24.144
All hail, the rightful ruler
of Sugar Rush.

01:28:24.179 --> 01:28:26.414
Princess Vanellope.

01:28:26.449 --> 01:28:29.242
I remember She's a princess

01:28:29.277 --> 01:28:30.775
That's right

01:28:30.776 --> 01:28:32.272
- We are so sorry about
the way we treated you

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:33.467
Ya, those were jokes..

01:28:33.502 --> 01:28:37.087
See, I was just doing
what Taffyta told me to

01:28:37.122 --> 01:28:42.026
Tat tat! as your merciful princess
I hereby decree that

01:28:42.162 --> 01:28:47.265
everyone who has ever
mean to be shall be...

01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:49.887
..executed
- What?

01:28:49.922 --> 01:28:52.269
No no no, please please
- Oh my lamnd

01:28:52.304 --> 01:28:54.775
Oh this place just got interesting

01:28:55.157 --> 01:28:58.025
I don't wanna die
- I'm just kidding

01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:00.596
You are?
- Stop crying, Taffyta.

01:29:00.631 --> 01:29:02.976
I'm trying but..
it won't stop

01:29:03.747 --> 01:29:06.806
Wow.. so this is
the real you?

01:29:07.577 --> 01:29:10.665
Princess..
- Oh, Ralph, what are you nuts?

01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:16.173
C'mon, this isn't me This is me

01:29:17.063 --> 01:29:21.023
Look, the code may say I'm a princess but,
I know who I really am Ralph

01:29:21.058 --> 01:29:24.459
I'm a racer with the greatest
superpower ever

01:29:24.494 --> 01:29:26.079
I was here I was there.

01:29:26.114 --> 01:29:29.083
I was glitching through the wall
I'm not giving that up

01:29:29.741 --> 01:29:34.765
Pardon me for asking but, without a
princess, who's gonna lead us? - Yea who?

01:29:35.564 --> 01:29:41.019
Uh.. me. I'm thinking more along
the lines of a constitutional democracy

01:29:41.054 --> 01:29:44.301
President Vanellope von Schweetz.

01:29:44.351 --> 01:29:46.617
Has a nice ring to it don't you think?

01:29:47.789 --> 01:29:49.944
Fix-It, Wreck-It, the
Arcade's about to open.

01:29:49.945 --> 01:29:52.099
Let's move 'em out

01:29:59.616 --> 01:30:02.627
You know you could just stay here
and live in the castle

01:30:02.662 --> 01:30:05.405
You'd have your own wing
where no one would

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:08.459
ever complain about you or
treat you bad ever again

01:30:08.495 --> 01:30:10.638
You could be happy

01:30:11.007 --> 01:30:13.153
I'm already happy

01:30:13.188 --> 01:30:15.703
Got the coolest friend in the world

01:30:15.972 --> 01:30:18.889
And besides, I've got a job to do too

01:30:18.924 --> 01:30:22.218
May not be as fancy as
being president...

01:30:22.253 --> 01:30:25.617
but it's my duty And it's a big duty

01:30:26.621 --> 01:30:28.836
Ralph, you coming brother?

01:30:30.034 --> 01:30:32.845
See you later, president Fartfeathers.

01:30:32.912 --> 01:30:36.466
Au revoir, admiral Underpants.

01:30:36.649 --> 01:30:39.422
And farewell, bareness Boogerface.

01:30:39.457 --> 01:30:41.808
Goodbye, major Bodyodour.

01:30:41.841 --> 01:30:44.324
Hasta la vista.

01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:46.792
Ralph..
- Alright, to be continued

01:31:01.071 --> 01:31:03.446
I'm gonna wreck it

01:31:04.334 --> 01:31:07.541
Hey, Ralph's back Isn't it great?

01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:11.941
The game's all here
- So, I'm happy to report...

01:31:12.151 --> 01:31:16.571
and you'll be happy to hear
I'm taking life one game at a time

01:31:18.204 --> 01:31:20.625
First, the job hasn't change

01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:25.244
But, news flash..
The Nicelanders are being nice to me

01:31:25.530 --> 01:31:29.127
And you know that got me thinking about
those poor guys left without a game

01:31:29.776 --> 01:31:31.817
So here's what we did
- We're going to wreck it!

01:31:31.852 --> 01:31:34.494
We ask them to help us out
in the bonus level

01:31:34.883 --> 01:31:36.400
We can fix it!

01:31:36.658 --> 01:31:39.968
I'm tellin' you guys, we haven't been
this popular in years

01:31:40.003 --> 01:31:44.657
It's crazy The gamers say we're Retro

01:31:44.692 --> 01:31:47.237
which... It means...
Old.. but Cool

01:31:47.272 --> 01:31:48.566
How come I never noticed this game

01:31:48.601 --> 01:31:52.109
Oh and I decided that living in
a dump wasn't making me feel very good

01:31:52.144 --> 01:31:56.821
So, I cleaned it up, built myself a little
shack and a couple for the new guys too

01:31:57.420 --> 01:32:00.535
Well, with a little help from Felix

01:32:00.570 --> 01:32:03.977
Oh and guess who is the best man
at his and Calhoun's wedding?

01:32:04.012 --> 01:32:07.206
That's right my friend
Old ham hands himself

01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:10.786
Very elegant affair,
should've seen her, lot of grandeur.

01:32:10.821 --> 01:32:13.143
And not a single bug

01:32:16.435 --> 01:32:20.227
And let's just say
some tears were shed.

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:25.296
But I gotta say,
the best part of my day...

01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:27.537
is when I get thrown off the roof...

01:32:28.835 --> 01:32:31.277
because when the Nicelanders lift me up..

01:32:31.901 --> 01:32:34.453
I get a perfect view of Sugar Rush

01:32:34.983 --> 01:32:37.207
And I can see Vanellope racing

01:32:41.071 --> 01:32:42.774
The kid's a natural..

01:32:42.975 --> 01:32:46.024
And the players love her glitch and all

01:32:46.222 --> 01:32:48.218
Just like I knew they would

01:32:49.206 --> 01:32:53.287
Turns out I don't need a medal
to tell me I'm a good guy

01:32:54.157 --> 01:32:56.946
Cause, if that little kid likes me...

01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:02.250
How bad can I be?

01:33:07.036 --> 01:33:12.548
