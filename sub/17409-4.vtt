10:09.710 --> 10:10.734
THE INSIDE AND ANOTHER ON THE

10:10.740 --> 10:13.277

CARE IF YOU LIKE ME OR IF YOU

10:35.830 --> 10:37.320

10:37.330 --> 10:38.194
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS FEELING

10:38.200 --> 10:39.326
COMPLETE AND NOT HAVING

10:39.330 --> 10:40.433
EVERYBODY LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M

11:31.920 --> 11:32.852
TOUCH HANDSOME, SEAN.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.249
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU SHE'S NOT A

11:35.260 --> 11:36.352

11:36.360 --> 11:38.248
Sean: BUT SOPHIA LOPEZ IS.

11:38.260 --> 11:40.023

11:45.130 --> 11:46.097
Christian: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT

11:46.100 --> 11:47.499
CONSULT WAS A TRANSSEXUAL, SEAN.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.364
SHE DIDN'T GIVE ME THAT

11:48.370 --> 11:49.837
INFORMATION OVER THE PHONE.

11:49.840 --> 11:50.966
BUT CLEARLY SHE MADE YOU

11:50.970 --> 11:52.107
FEEL UPTIGHT.

11:52.110 --> 11:53.873
Sean: I AM NOT UPTIGHT!

11:53.880 --> 11:55.074
Christian: I'M SORRY.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.104
I STAND CORRECTED.

11:56.110 --> 11:57.247
THAT SAID,

11:57.250 --> 11:58.979
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE JUDGED

11:58.980 --> 12:00.470
UNFAIRLY WHICH IS A DAILY BATTLE

12:00.480 --> 12:02.846
WAGED BY BOTH WALLACE'S GIRLS,

12:02.850 --> 12:04.283
AND I'M SURE SOPHIA LOPEZ,

12:04.290 --> 12:05.848
TO BE PUT IN A BOX THAT DOESN'T

12:05.850 --> 12:07.112
DEFINE YOU?

12:07.120 --> 12:08.109
Sean: FOR YOUR INFORMATION, I

12:08.120 --> 12:09.257
BREAK OUT OF THAT BOX ALL

12:09.260 --> 12:11.023
THE TIME.

12:11.030 --> 12:14.022
IN FACT, JUST THIS MORNING...

12:14.030 --> 12:16.089
JULIA AND I HAD UNCONVENTIONAL

12:16.100 --> 12:20.537
SEX.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.861
Christian: IS THAT SO?

12:22.870 --> 12:27.136
HOW'D IT GO, KILLER?

12:27.140 --> 12:30.041
Sean: IT DIDN'T.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.177
I WAS CLUMSY AND UNCONVINCING,

12:32.180 --> 12:34.011
AND SHE WAS...

12:34.020 --> 12:36.887
HORRIFIED.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.414
I WAS TRYING TO SPICE THINGS UP.

12:38.420 --> 12:40.411
JULIA AND I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN

12:40.420 --> 12:42.388
CONNECTING LATELY, AND NOW THAT

12:42.390 --> 12:43.550
SHE'S GOIN' BACK TO SCHOOL, I'M

12:43.560 --> 12:44.549
AFRAID WE'RE GONNA BECOME EVEN

12:44.560 --> 12:47.427
MORE DISTANT.

12:47.430 --> 12:49.898
HOW DO YOU SEDUCE WOMEN INTO

12:49.900 --> 12:53.461
LOOSENING UP?

12:53.470 --> 12:56.906
Christian: WELL...

12:56.910 --> 12:59.162
IT'S ABOUT CHARM, SEAN, AND

12:59.170 --> 13:01.934
CONFIDENCE.

13:01.940 --> 13:04.443
YOU WINE, YOU DINE, YOU ROMANCE.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.042
JULIA NEEDS THAT.

13:06.050 --> 13:07.915
SHE'S CLEARLY STARVED FOR IT.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.185
Sean: HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

13:11.190 --> 13:12.851
Christian: EVERY WOMAN IS.

13:33.980 --> 13:34.969
Julia: SEAN?

13:40.480 --> 13:41.469
Sean: IN HERE.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.469
