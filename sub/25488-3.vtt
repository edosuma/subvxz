-Hello.
<i> Good morning,</i>
<i>Mr. St. Patrick.</i>

02:23.810 --> 02:25.186
<i>This is the front desk.</i>

02:25.270 --> 02:28.148
<i>There's an NYPD detective</i>
<i>here to see you.</i>

02:28.481 --> 02:30.233
-Send him up.
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

02:37.198 --> 02:39.450
-The police.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.578
-No idea, Tash.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.038
-Detective Leary.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.540
-Morning.
-Good morning.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.376
Has something happened?

02:48.835 --> 02:51.796
Setting up the public tip line
was the right move.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.508
I was kind of hoping I could
talk to, uh, Tariq.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.510
Sure, yeah. Um...

02:57.594 --> 03:00.972
Tariq, would you come
down here, please?

03:01.055 --> 03:02.265
He's just getting
ready for school.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.516
Yeah.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.060
Tariq, you remember
Detective Leary?

03:06.144 --> 03:07.729
-I'm good.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.230
We've had a tip
in your sister's case.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.149
Now, the night
Raina was killed,

03:11.232 --> 03:14.068
someone said they saw you
running out of the building,

03:14.152 --> 03:15.320
and your sister followed you.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.363
Now, that's different
from your statement

03:17.447 --> 03:19.240
where you said you went out
after your sister.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.326
I was just hoping
you could clear that up
for me.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.288
Go ahead,
he's here to help us.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.999
Well, I mean,
I guess I did go outside,
but...

03:29.667 --> 03:32.962
I came back in.
Maybe whoever saw me go out
didn't see me come back in.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.590
Can you tell me why you
went outside the first time?

03:37.508 --> 03:41.930
-I really don't remember.
-You know, we have to get
ready to go, Detective.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.891
-So, if that's all...
-Yeah, for now.

03:45.683 --> 03:48.728
Tariq, don't worry.
We're gonna solve this.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.650
I'll see him out.
Have a good day, son.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.777
-Bye, Tash.
-Bye.

03:58.529 --> 03:59.656
Goodbye, Detective.

03:59.739 --> 04:00.907
You hang in there.

04:07.997 --> 04:10.375
Riq, I need you
to tell me the truth.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.710
Were you out there
when Ray Ray killed Raina?

04:12.794 --> 04:14.796
I promise I wasn't out there,
I swear.

04:16.297 --> 04:17.924
All right.
All right.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.134
Go ahead.

04:26.015 --> 04:27.475
Yo, K, let me
ask you something.

04:30.144 --> 04:32.855
Did Riq tell you how he knew
Ray Ray was looking for him?
You know, when he hit you.

04:33.022 --> 04:34.941
Nah, he just said
he was looking for him.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.318
Damn.
And he ain't hit you since?

04:37.402 --> 04:39.696
I ain't supposed to be talking
to the little nigga, remember?

04:40.863 --> 04:42.323
Yo, what's up with
all these questions?

04:42.699 --> 04:44.158
Cop came by this morning.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.327
Oh, yeah?

04:47.495 --> 04:50.665
Yeah, we got tricked into
doing a press conference
about Raina's murder.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.250
-I got a question for you.
Yeah.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.460
Why you can't stay off
the fucking TV?

04:55.628 --> 04:57.005
I mean, you do
understand the concept

04:57.088 --> 04:58.506
of being a criminal,
right, Ghost?

04:58.798 --> 05:01.217
Come on, Tommy, I'm just
trying to build something
for my daughter, man.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.845
-Something to honor her.
It's under control?

05:07.473 --> 05:08.850
Yeah.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.935
Body's gone.
Gun's gone.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.647
-It's done.

05:14.731 --> 05:15.898
Good, let's go.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.903
I'm investigating the death
of a Detective Raymond Jones.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.239
I discovered he accessed
Tariq St. Patrick's

05:23.323 --> 05:26.326
witness statement regarding
his sister's death.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.494
I didn't know Detective Jones
accessed my case,

05:28.578 --> 05:31.164
-but he has come up
in my investigation.

05:31.247 --> 05:34.709
Apparently, Detective Jones
visited Tariq St. Patrick
in school.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.127
But the kid cut school
that day,

05:36.210 --> 05:37.670
so he talked
to his sister instead.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.547
So my dead cop

05:39.630 --> 05:42.508
talked to your dead girl
days before they were
both killed?

05:42.675 --> 05:46.721
The headmistress also told me
that a federal prosecutor
by the name of...

05:47.930 --> 05:49.932
Angela Valdes
came by the school

05:50.016 --> 05:52.393
the day
after the girl was shot,
asking about Jones. Why would a fed
be interested in this case?

05:56.064 --> 05:57.106
I don't know.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.192
But I'll find out.

06:02.987 --> 06:05.239
This is Diego Jimenez.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.325
We're not sure
who the woman is.

06:07.408 --> 06:10.411
NYPD thought that because
they were carrying a child,

06:10.495 --> 06:12.747
they were residents
in the building.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.333
Turns out they stole the baby
from the crime scene.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.668
Now, between
the surveillance footage,

06:17.752 --> 06:21.506
the match of the gold gun
to the murder,
plus the Jimenez calling card--

06:21.589 --> 06:24.550
-Angela, wait a minute--
-We have a rock-solid
arrest warrant.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.511
I can convict Diego
within six months.

06:26.594 --> 06:27.637
You're moving too fast.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.555
The Jimenez
were Lobos' only rival,

06:29.639 --> 06:32.350
and their organization has
become massive without him.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.186
Taking out just one of
the brothers won't do anything
to slow their momentum.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.688
-This is a bird in the hand.
-I get it.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.024
You have a history to rewrite.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.943
Don't fumble on the first play.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.489
I have another meeting.
We'll reconvene on this later.

06:46.572 --> 06:50.326
Tameika, arresting the Jimenez
should be
this office's top priority.

06:51.285 --> 06:53.371
Killing the Jimenez
should be our top priority.

06:53.579 --> 06:56.249
-No, I'd rather
shoot Dre in his face.
-Ha!

06:56.332 --> 06:58.084
We can't just keep
following Dre around

06:58.167 --> 07:00.378
and expect him
not to catch on.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.588
I got a better idea.
You know his nigga, 2

07:03.005 --> 07:04.090
-Yeah.
-No.

07:04.298 --> 07:07.135
Him and Dre beefing.
Got into a little scrap
the other day.

07:07.343 --> 07:08.469
How you know, K?

07:09.011 --> 07:10.138
I've been watching Dre move.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.976
I thought we were supposed to
be working together on this.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.228
I'm sharing with
the goddamn class, ain't I?

07:17.812 --> 07:20.106
I think I can turn
that 2-Bit motherfucker.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.817
At least get him to tell me
when Dre gonna meet
with the Jimenez.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.236
Unless Dre already
told him what's up.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.905
And he shoots you in the face
and gets a goddamn attaboy
from Dre.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.700
Ain't no small-time
motherfucker like that
gonna get the drop on me.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.077
You forget
who you talking to.

07:33.202 --> 07:34.245
Okay.
-I'm good.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.663
All right.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.290
K, you let me know
when you know, all right?

07:37.540 --> 07:39.041
-All right.
-I gotta wrap.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.210
Yo, no, Ghost, hold up.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.962
-Let me holler at you.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.798
I gotta clean my money
for Jason.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.383
I was wondering
if we could go back to do it

07:47.467 --> 07:49.218
like we did in the old days,
just for a little while.

07:49.385 --> 07:51.554
-I could run that money
through the club?
-Tommy, that's no <i>bueno, </i>man.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.265
I gotta stay squeaky clean.
I can't be involved
in no shit like that.

07:54.432 --> 07:55.391
-Tommy, come on.
-But, like--

07:55.475 --> 07:57.268
I gotta go meet
with an investor
about Raina's building.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.896
-We'll wrap later.
Hey, lay in.
-All right.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.522
-Thanks for the food.
-Yeah, peace.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.608
-Later, K.
-All right.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.613
You know, after Dre dead,

08:08.696 --> 08:10.656
he ain't got no skin
in the game.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.824
Tell me something I don't know.

08:12.617 --> 08:13.951
Then let me in
on that product.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.412
I'll help you move it fast
so you can pay Jason.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.289
Take some weight
off your hand today.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.124
I'm doing all right
selling through the Italians.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.002
What, you think I ain't?

08:23.336 --> 08:26.088
No offense, K, but if I do
bring you in on this,

08:26.172 --> 08:27.798
you gonna have to pay up front,

08:27.882 --> 08:29.091
just like everybody else.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.557
Make sure the flowers
is covering all that yay.

08:36.641 --> 08:38.142
Careful with them thorns, bro,

08:38.226 --> 08:39.810
you're gonna open up
one of them packs, man.

08:39.894 --> 08:40.937
Yo, pass me a light, bro.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.438
What's up?

08:45.191 --> 08:46.859
Come on, man,
let's hurry up.
Let's get this done.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.361
You see me working.

08:56.744 --> 08:58.871
Yo, what the fuck
are they saying, man?

08:58.955 --> 09:00.873
Need subtitles and shit.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.041
Diego.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.794
Hey, man, you didn't tell me
you was gonna be here.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.256
You should know by now, I don't
like to announce myself.

09:08.589 --> 09:11.717
What's up, Dre?
Why you brought us
all here together, man?

09:12.635 --> 09:14.428
Well, I gathered you here
because when there's change

09:14.512 --> 09:16.764
I need things to be
crystal fucking clear.

09:16.847 --> 09:18.891
All right, if you didn't know,
that's Arturo.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.769
He got revenge for
his cousin Uriel's death, man.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.521
Uriel was a good man.

09:23.604 --> 09:26.315
He was a good soldier.
Arturo's one of us now.

09:26.607 --> 09:30.528
You mean, little man took out
Lorenzo all by himself?

09:30.736 --> 09:32.530
I murdered that
traitor Lorenzo.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.865
Y'all need something now,
you come to me.  Shit, man.

09:36.826 --> 09:40.079
I've heard that there
are some supporters

09:41.414 --> 09:43.332
who challenge your accusation

09:43.416 --> 09:45.001
that Lorenzo killed Uriel.

09:46.627 --> 09:49.422
They question whether you
were justified to murder him.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.132
Well, if there's a dispute,

09:51.215 --> 09:53.342
then it'll get dealt with
quick and effectively.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.637
You see,
we run a tight ship
around here, Diego,

09:56.721 --> 09:58.389
so it's all good, man.

09:58.472 --> 09:59.473
Arturo.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.524
Some motherfuckers
still running their mouth.
Lorenzo's fools.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.526
We fixin' to light 'em up.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.820
I think I'd like to see
this thing firsthand.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.655
See how
you handle disloyalty.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.699
Come on down to the spot then.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.534
-I show you how we do it.
-Let's go.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.579
Uh, Diego, let me talk
to you real quick.

10:21.912 --> 10:22.913
You think that's the best idea?

10:22.997 --> 10:25.750
It's already tough enough
putting these face-to-face
meetings together.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.002
-If law enforcement sees us
running together--
-No, no, no.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.462
You think I give
a fuck about that?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.255
-No.

10:36.677 --> 10:37.887
Cristobal.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.310
I don't get it.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.813
Dre took our shit
'cause you shot
that Lorenzo motherfucker,

10:48.147 --> 10:50.733
but then let this nigga
take the credit for it?

10:51.400 --> 10:52.818
You see that bullshit?

10:54.236 --> 10:56.238
Yeah, I see that shit.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.533
As you can see,
residential units

10:59.617 --> 11:01.744
are on the upper floor,
which on the western side

11:02.036 --> 11:04.830
have unobstructed views
of the Manhattan skyline.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.583
It's really a thing of beauty.
Really, really is--

11:07.667 --> 11:09.251
And then in addition
to the sports center

11:09.335 --> 11:10.836
for the children,
we've set it up

11:10.920 --> 11:12.546
where we have retail spaces
on the ground level.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.132
We wanna make sure that
children have room to play

11:15.257 --> 11:16.467
and also jobs
for the community.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.303
Oh, I didn't realize
it was zoned for retail.

11:20.596 --> 11:21.555
It's not.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.808
But we're looking into it.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.019
Yes. We are certainly
looking into it.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.188
Uh, okay.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.732
And how much do you need
to fill the remainder?

11:31.816 --> 11:34.485
-About $12 million.
Rashad.

11:34.568 --> 11:37.321
-Take a girl to dinner first.

11:38.030 --> 11:41.617
Well, Linda, we have
so many investors that are
interested in meeting with us,

11:41.700 --> 11:43.828
but we wanted
to make sure that you

11:43.911 --> 11:46.288
-got the first bite
of the apple.
-Mmm.

11:47.331 --> 11:49.542
Well, guys, this sounds like
a wonderful little project,

11:49.625 --> 11:52.169
and as a memorial to
your daughter, James,
that's really nice.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.838
-Thank you.
-But it's not for me.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.631
Uh, hang on a second, Linda.
You haven't heard us--

11:55.714 --> 11:57.133
No, actually,
I have heard enough.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.760
Gentlemen, thank you.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.929
And I wish you luck.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.431
Thank you for the time, Linda.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.267
Thank you, Linda.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.313
-Hmm.
-James.

12:15.317 --> 12:16.777
What was that?

12:16.861 --> 12:18.279
We never discussed retail.

12:18.487 --> 12:19.738
Oh, come on, Rashad,
give me a break.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.115
She was into it
until you shut it down.

12:21.198 --> 12:24.869
-Besides,
there'll be other investors.
-Linda was worth six investors.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.745
Look, if you want her
to break open her checkbook,

12:26.829 --> 12:28.372
you gotta be on board with me. Follow my lead.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.209
-Yes.

12:32.293 --> 12:35.838
While you sit here and run your
mouth about residences
and views and shit.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.381
This is my vision, Rashad.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.133
The only reason
you're in my vision

12:39.216 --> 12:41.427
is because you know I know
how to make something great.

12:41.510 --> 12:42.511
Come on, man.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.431
I know you understand
how to run a successful club,

12:45.514 --> 12:47.099
and it's beautiful.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.268
But this is a completely
different game, my brother.

12:51.437 --> 12:55.774
Listen, we're in this together.
You and I, we are a team.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.693
And...

12:57.776 --> 13:00.404
as your partner,
with all due respect,

13:00.488 --> 13:02.156
I think you need
to take some time off.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.367
Yeah, I can handle
the private investors.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.912
And I'll be sure
that Raina gets honored.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.371
With all due respect,

13:09.455 --> 13:11.457
it's my project,
it's my daughter. I'll get it done.
You can see yourself out.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.055
Teresi.
Thanks for meeting us.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.807
The fuck do you want?

13:29.767 --> 13:32.478
-Your lawyer moved
to have your sentence commuted.
-Uh-huh.

13:32.561 --> 13:35.189
We'd be happy
to let you out, really,

13:36.148 --> 13:37.983
but not without
something in return.

13:38.567 --> 13:39.944
You didn't tell him, did you?

13:40.945 --> 13:42.321
The only reason
I'm in here is

13:42.404 --> 13:44.698
that I'm not a fucking
snitch piece of shit.

13:45.282 --> 13:48.494
You can hold on to
your Cosa Nostra bullshit
all you want.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.914
But we're here to give you
a chance to see Connie.

13:52.790 --> 13:53.958
Before she's gone.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.086
We're very interested in
what you can tell us about

13:57.545 --> 13:59.171
a man you've been
talking to recently.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.297
I've been locked up.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.508
I ain't talked
to anybody recently.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.468
Thomas Patrick Egan?

14:06.262 --> 14:08.597
Or... Or should I say,

14:08.681 --> 14:10.683
Thomas Patrick Teresi?

14:12.935 --> 14:14.853
Yeah, you know,
as far as we knew,

14:15.271 --> 14:18.691
Thomas Egan was raised
by a single mom out in Queens.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.818
No father to speak of.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.821
Now, all of a sudden,

14:23.904 --> 14:26.031
he's visiting
Daddy dearest in jail.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.536
We're thinking he might tell
you things about his business,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.873
about his friend
James St. Patrick, maybe.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.970
This is fucking hilarious.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.389
What's so funny?

14:50.723 --> 14:54.560
-What, you can't be
that close to him.
-No, it's not that.

14:55.102 --> 14:57.021
It's that the two of you think
you came up with this

14:57.104 --> 14:58.314
all by yourselves.

14:59.106 --> 15:03.110
I've been laying this track
ever since I heard
about Tommy Egan.

15:04.194 --> 15:07.698
You know, getting close to him,
getting to know him.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.159
And you guys
wouldn't bite.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.119
I finally had to get my lawyer

15:12.202 --> 15:14.371
to file one of those
"comm" things, the--

15:14.455 --> 15:15.623
-Commutation.
-Yeah.

15:16.665 --> 15:19.585
-You get us to make you a deal.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.920
Smart.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.672
-Do you think Egan
suspects anything?
-Ah.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.469
He thinks that I wanna get
close to the son I never knew.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.973
So, the day he died,
it turns out Detective Jones

15:33.057 --> 15:36.602
looked at a witness statement
from, uh,
Tariq St. Patrick

15:36.685 --> 15:38.520
about the death
of his sister, Raina.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.064
And?

15:40.898 --> 15:44.026
Well, it seems you accessed
this same witness statement.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.530
-That'd be a coincidence,
not a connection.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.409
He's a detective and likely
investigating something.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.161
For me,
the interest was personal.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.455
-I knew Raina.
-But you went to his flop.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.874
And before that, his house.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.834
I mean, didn't you?

16:01.585 --> 16:04.129
I... I know
you mentioned before

16:04.338 --> 16:06.590
that you never
spoke with him directly. But you did go
to his house, right?

16:10.594 --> 16:11.887
As I told you before,

16:11.971 --> 16:13.347
I'm conducting
an investigation.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.850
It's not that I won't answer
your questions, Sergeant,

16:16.934 --> 16:18.352
it's that I can't.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.145
But could you tell me

16:20.229 --> 16:22.815
how Raymond Jones and Raina
are connected?

16:24.233 --> 16:25.901
I've gotta get to work now.

16:26.110 --> 16:26.986
So should you.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.120
Could you get the door?

16:59.810 --> 17:03.480
Okay. Would anyone
like to start us off?

17:04.565 --> 17:08.318
Um... The other night,
it seems, uh,

17:08.402 --> 17:10.904
a prayer was answered.

17:12.197 --> 17:13.282
The man...

17:14.658 --> 17:15.909
The drunk

17:15.993 --> 17:17.745
who killed our son,
he, uh...

17:19.705 --> 17:20.956
He was stabbed to death.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.920
You know,
I thought this would
make me feel better.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.466
But it doesn't change anything.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.592
It do...

17:32.676 --> 17:33.594
It...

17:34.970 --> 17:36.722
The police, they suspect me.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.349
Obviously, I mean, uh,

17:40.809 --> 17:42.436
if anyone wanted him dead,

17:43.062 --> 17:43.979
I did.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.818
This doesn't bring Luke back.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.992
Nothing will.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.413
Nothing's gonna
bring my baby...

18:01.497 --> 18:02.498
Baby.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.971
But I didn't think
she was gonna be a problem.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.933
But she's made a connection
between Raymond Jones
and Raina.

18:22.893 --> 18:23.894
Tasha.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.939
Um, I'm sorry.

18:30.818 --> 18:31.735
It's nothing.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.447
Um, so, okay,
so you were saying this woman,

18:35.531 --> 18:37.449
she made a connection
between Ray Ray and Raina?

18:37.533 --> 18:40.577
-That I was conducting
a federal investigation,

18:40.661 --> 18:43.038
and as local NYPD
she needed to leave it alone.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.124
Do you think she will?

18:46.542 --> 18:47.668
No.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.380
But I can stop it.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.882
Obstruction of justice,
round two.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.219
I'm supposed to be
this great prosecutor

18:57.302 --> 19:01.140
and here I am
colluding with you to
cover up a fucking murder.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.351
I just came from church, so...

19:04.810 --> 19:06.061
-Here we are.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.989
If I can't stop this woman,
we may need to talk to Jamie,

19:17.239 --> 19:18.448
and bring him into the loop.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.702
No. Stop her, please.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.121
Ghost can only
make things worse.

19:35.757 --> 19:37.593
Oh, shit.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.557
In and out of town,
you know me.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.142
You still running for Dre?

19:45.225 --> 19:46.560
Yeah, you gonna see him?

19:47.144 --> 19:48.729
He ain't tell you
about me and him?

19:49.563 --> 19:51.106
What happened between y'all?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.608
You remember Broc, right?

19:53.650 --> 19:55.152
Last I heard,
he caught a body.

19:55.235 --> 19:56.278
He had to leave town.

19:57.237 --> 20:00.657
Remember the night Broc was
mouthing off to Tommy and shit,
getting all disrespectful?

20:00.741 --> 20:03.744
-Uh-huh.
-Dre went and beat
the boy half to death.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.787
-Come on, man.
-Cut his tongue out.
Shot him in the head.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.955
The fuck?

20:07.497 --> 20:09.625
Take you, show you
where the body at right now
if you want.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.877
But you know
where he be hiding his shit.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.632
He lying to you
about Broc, man.

20:17.633 --> 20:18.926
Damn, man,
I think he treating you

20:19.009 --> 20:20.636
like you the police
or some shit.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.722
Thought he was fucking
with you, right?

20:26.767 --> 20:28.435
Dre took away my gambling shit

20:28.518 --> 20:30.520
to check me like
I'm his goddamn kid.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.522
Word

20:32.606 --> 20:34.858
Cristobal,
head of the Tainos.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.360
His new best fucking friend.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.405
I think the new connect
like Cristobal

20:40.489 --> 20:41.823
more than he like Dre.

20:41.907 --> 20:45.077
Newsflash,
everybody like everybody
more than they like Dre.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.286
-And fast.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.663
Let me get one of them.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.957
You a crazy motherfucker.

20:50.707 --> 20:52.251
So what's up
with the gambling shit?

20:54.086 --> 20:55.504
Listen, I only got a minute.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.047
I just heard from my lawyer.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.132
There's something happening
with my case.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.884
I think I might see
daylight soon.

21:03.428 --> 21:04.513
How is he gonna do that?

21:04.596 --> 21:06.598
<i> Something to do</i>
<i>with a crooked prosecutor.</i>

21:06.974 --> 21:09.393
I don't know, but I think
they're throwing out
all of his cases.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.354
<i>Hey, I'm too old to worry</i>
<i>about the details.</i>

21:12.813 --> 21:15.565
I just can't wait to make up
for lost time with you, son.

21:18.318 --> 21:19.736
-All right.
<i>-Talk later.</i>

21:30.664 --> 21:33.792
You know that couple
who lost their son
to a drunk driver?

21:35.502 --> 21:37.754
The drunk driver
was killed the other night.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.925
Well, they can rest easier
knowing he's dead.

21:43.635 --> 21:45.345
Did you know
about this already?

21:49.474 --> 21:52.519
Ghost, please tell me
you didn't have anything
to do with this.

21:52.602 --> 21:54.104
I didn't have anything
to do with it.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.274
What is wrong with you?

21:57.357 --> 21:59.776
You can't kill Dre,
and for some fucking reason

21:59.860 --> 22:01.236
you refuse to kill Kanan. And now you're a vigilante?

22:02.988 --> 22:04.698
They don't feel better
that he's dead.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.034
Just like we don't feel
better that Ray Ray is dead.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.410
Trust me,
they will feel better.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.829
-That motherfucker can't hurt
anyone again, all right?

22:11.997 --> 22:13.165
Do you feel better?

22:14.708 --> 22:17.044
You can put a hundred bodies
in the ground, Ghost,

22:17.836 --> 22:20.213
and not one of them
is gonna bring her back.

22:23.550 --> 22:24.760
I had to do it.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.639
I had to make
one thing right, Tasha, okay?

22:30.891 --> 22:33.518
Come on, Tasha.
He's a goddamn drunk driver.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.521
He's gonna fucking
kill another kid.
Nobody will miss him.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.190
You don't get to make
that fucking call.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.484
I've been making that call
since you've known me.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.946
The next time
you feel you need

22:45.030 --> 22:46.990
to kill somebody
so damn bad,

22:48.408 --> 22:50.327
why don't you kill
Kanan instead?

23:01.004 --> 23:02.255
Let's get this over with.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.010
What do you know about them?

23:07.302 --> 23:08.428
This is Diego Jimenez,

23:08.512 --> 23:10.347
the Chihuahua
of the Jimenez clan.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.390
Been raised in the States
since his mom
moved to San Diego.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.643
-Mmm...

23:14.726 --> 23:16.144
Maybe a wife,
a girlfriend?

23:16.228 --> 23:18.146
I know she goes
by the name Alicia.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.483
I'm looking to connect him

23:21.566 --> 23:24.194
with his brother
who we think
stays across the border,

23:24.277 --> 23:25.904
and build a RICO case.

23:25.987 --> 23:28.031
Do you have any idea
as to his identity

23:28.115 --> 23:31.660
or are you familiar with
any of the other players?

23:31.743 --> 23:34.412
I mean,
the rest of them down there
stay pretty low-profile.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.873
They're ruthless,
but they're also survivors.

23:39.126 --> 23:42.254
I can hook you up with Mexico's
AUSA equivalent on the case.

23:42.879 --> 23:44.297
You wanna
work with me on this?

23:44.381 --> 23:46.758
If it means we get
the bad guys, sure.

23:48.385 --> 23:51.930
Oh, no, one last thing.
You're not fucking
Diego Jimenez by any chance?

23:52.347 --> 23:54.558
If I were,
I wouldn't need you.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.476
Oh. I just had to check.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.703
-Tommy.
-Hey, Keisha.

24:16.079 --> 24:17.080
Come in.

24:24.004 --> 24:24.838
What's up?

24:25.755 --> 24:28.133
-You can't stay that long.

24:28.383 --> 24:30.844
-'Cause I got a friend
coming over.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.430
-That's none of your business.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.265
Well...

24:36.141 --> 24:37.475
I got something I wanna
talk to you about.

24:37.559 --> 24:38.852
Can we sit down somewhere?

24:40.145 --> 24:41.188
Please?

24:46.693 --> 24:47.986
Sit down.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.743
-My dad is getting
out of prison.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.996
-I thought you said
he was in there for life.
-Yeah, that's what I thought.

24:58.288 --> 24:59.497
I don't trust it.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.499
And now he wants to
hang out and everything,

25:01.583 --> 25:03.293
like we're gonna
play catch or some shit.

25:03.376 --> 25:04.920
And the thing is,

25:05.003 --> 25:07.214
I just found out he existed,
you know?

25:07.297 --> 25:08.840
But he known about me
my whole life.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.885
So it's like, why now?

25:11.968 --> 25:14.179
Does he want some shit
from me or something?

25:14.679 --> 25:15.722
I don't know, Tommy.

25:16.848 --> 25:17.849
I mean,

25:19.100 --> 25:20.727
he's old, right?

25:20.810 --> 25:21.728
Yeah.

25:22.812 --> 25:25.857
So he might be trying to
make right by his mistakes.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.860
I'm not saying
you shouldn't be suspicious,

25:28.944 --> 25:30.820
but if it was me,
I wouldn't say no.

25:33.323 --> 25:35.325
Some mistakes
are made to be forgiven.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.246
You really believe that?

25:42.832 --> 25:45.252
'Cause I made a big mistake
with you, Keisha.

25:45.669 --> 25:48.713
I did too, with you.

25:49.297 --> 25:50.382
Ooh.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.635
So you really came over here
to talk about your dad?

25:54.636 --> 25:56.179
Or are you just
trying to get back in?

25:56.388 --> 25:57.806
-I'm asking.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.266
It ain't even like that.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.892
I don't know
what to do about my dad.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.852
And I sure as hell don't know
what to do about you.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.479
What, you gonna
hate me forever?

26:04.562 --> 26:07.232
-I don't hate you.

26:07.315 --> 26:10.568
Look, maybe your dad
had his reasons
why he stayed away.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.237
Yeah.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.614
Maybe he did.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.283
If you really don't trust it,

26:16.574 --> 26:18.201
is there any way you can
find out if it's real?

26:19.202 --> 26:21.162
Like, do you know anyone
that knows him?

26:21.246 --> 26:22.872
Anyone that knows
his situation?

26:24.124 --> 26:26.418
You know what?
I think I might know somebody.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.464
See, you're smart.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.842
-Thanks, Keish.
-You're welcome.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.471
Bye, Tommy.

26:40.348 --> 26:41.391
Okay.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.729
Bye, Keisha.

26:57.907 --> 26:59.701
Tommy ain't home?

27:03.204 --> 27:04.622
No, he's not.

27:05.165 --> 27:06.374
Sorry about Raina.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.836
You should be sorry
about Tariq.

27:10.086 --> 27:11.713
If it weren't for you,
he wouldn't have been messing

27:11.796 --> 27:13.298
with Ray Ray
in the first place.

27:13.381 --> 27:16.676
He'd still be a good kid.
And Raina would still be alive.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.721
I think you're forgetting
I saved Tariq's life,
twice now.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.222
If you didn't bring him
into the life, you wouldn't have had to.

27:22.974 --> 27:26.061
You don't get
no motherfucking points for
cleaning up a mess you made.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.355
You picked a drug dealer
for his father, Tasha.

27:28.438 --> 27:29.731
You brought the boy
into this life

27:29.814 --> 27:31.191
before the little nigga
was born. You still look good, though.

27:33.693 --> 27:34.652
Get the f--

27:34.736 --> 27:36.696
I bet you like to fight back.

27:38.948 --> 27:41.868
-Yeah, you like that.
-If you fuck with me,

27:42.577 --> 27:44.371
you better kill me, nigga.

27:44.454 --> 27:45.830
'Cause I swear to God,

27:46.539 --> 27:48.249
you best believe
I will get you back.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.627
-I believe you.

27:51.920 --> 27:52.837
What's up, y'all?

27:53.713 --> 27:55.090
I'm just chopping it up
about old times.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.800
Fuck you, Kanan.

27:56.883 --> 27:59.260
And fuck you too,
for bringing him
into our lives.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.679
I'm your family, not him.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.223
What the fuck
did you just say to her?

28:03.973 --> 28:06.059
-Nothing, she's just trippin'.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.019
Stay here.

28:13.691 --> 28:14.984
Tasha.

28:17.487 --> 28:19.614
What'd you do,
run down the stairs?

28:19.697 --> 28:22.659
-I've had to catch women
leaving here before.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.995
-What the fuck
happened up there?
-I don't wanna talk about it.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.497
I just don't want him around.

28:27.705 --> 28:29.582
He serves a purpose, T.

28:29.749 --> 28:33.128
Look, I know
how you feel about him,
but once this Dre shit is over,

28:33.211 --> 28:35.338
so will this
little reunion with K.

28:35.422 --> 28:36.381
Hmm.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.341
What'd you come here for?

28:41.136 --> 28:44.013
-Ghost killed somebody
the other night.

28:45.306 --> 28:46.516
Who?

28:46.599 --> 28:48.476
A drunk driver
killed a kid.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.812
The parents told the story
in our grief group.

28:52.355 --> 28:53.606
No one's gonna
miss the guy.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.400
That's not
the fucking point, Tommy.

28:55.483 --> 28:58.319
Ghost is acting reckless.
And if he gets caught,

28:58.403 --> 28:59.738
it could fuck up
our whole shit.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.406
So, please,
keep an eye on him.

29:01.489 --> 29:03.575
Yeah, yeah, okay,
I'll keep an eye.

29:03.658 --> 29:04.617
-I will.
-Thank you.

29:04.701 --> 29:05.952
You're welcome.
And, Tasha,

29:06.870 --> 29:08.455
I hear you about Kanan.

29:08.538 --> 29:11.458
-It won't be too long.
-It better not be.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.126
Or I'll do something
about him myself.

29:17.255 --> 29:20.550
These men
all remained loyal to Lorenzo,

29:20.633 --> 29:23.762
even after he conspired
to kill my cousin Uriel!

29:23.845 --> 29:24.846
Hmm?

29:26.014 --> 29:28.141
Far as I'm concerned,
these bitch-ass niggas

29:28.224 --> 29:29.893
deserve to die
right alongside him.

29:30.185 --> 29:32.020
-Yeah.

29:32.771 --> 29:33.813
The look in a man's face

29:33.897 --> 29:35.565
when he knows
he's made the wrong choice.

29:36.983 --> 29:39.402
Fear. Regret.

29:42.614 --> 29:43.907
Arturo, how did you know?

29:45.200 --> 29:48.119
I always assumed Lorenzo would
do better at planning a coup.

29:48.620 --> 29:52.040
Lorenzo would run his mouth,
so that's how word got out.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.834
Why do you insist
on answering a question
that isn't addressed to you?

29:55.251 --> 29:56.628
-No, I'm just--
-Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

30:04.928 --> 30:08.014
What Dre said is right.
Motherfucker was talking shit.

30:12.894 --> 30:16.022
Maybe we should ask him.
See what he has to say.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.273
Hmm?

30:19.567 --> 30:21.736
Nah. Go ahead, do it.

30:23.988 --> 30:26.866
-Yeah.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.294
Fuck you.
-Mmm-hmm.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.264
You know,

30:49.347 --> 30:51.683
the state of your business
is very volatile right now.

30:51.766 --> 30:54.644
I think you need
a strong hand to help you.

30:54.727 --> 30:56.229
I'm handling it just fine.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.815
And what about when
the Toros revolt again?

30:58.898 --> 31:01.442
Whose army will you use
to keep them in check?

31:02.151 --> 31:05.238
-No. Cristobal
is gonna be your number two.

31:05.321 --> 31:07.323
And you're gonna
watch your step.

31:07.407 --> 31:08.908
You know, I don't know
how it is that you made

31:08.992 --> 31:10.785
my sister's pussy so wet, but
you don't make my dick hard.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.329
I have no interest
in your sister
beyond business, Diego.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.333
I know. But keep
your fucking eyes to yourself.

31:18.751 --> 31:20.253
Or I'll rip 'em
from your head.

31:22.630 --> 31:24.257
And I'll choke you with them.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.136
All right.  I'll get back to you.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.273
Okay.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.735
-Oh--
-I'm so sorry.

31:43.818 --> 31:45.236
Oh, it's-- It's okay.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.447
-Let me help you with these.
-I-- I got it.

31:48.865 --> 31:49.949
I, um...

31:50.491 --> 31:53.286
You're Angela Valdes.
Right?

31:53.369 --> 31:55.663
You're the new Head of Criminal
here at the Eastern District?

31:56.414 --> 31:59.626
I'm sorry.
Agent Juan Julio Medina,
he spoke about you

31:59.709 --> 32:01.377
when I met with his division
a few days ago.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.964
He was actually just here,

32:05.048 --> 32:07.050
helping me with a case.

32:07.133 --> 32:09.677
That makes you... DEA?

32:09.761 --> 32:12.430
Oh, yeah.
Steve Tampio.

32:15.308 --> 32:16.893
D.C. office.

32:16.976 --> 32:19.896
Not bad.
I'm sure Mom's proud.

32:22.023 --> 32:26.361
What does the Director of
Public Enrichment do exactly?

32:26.444 --> 32:29.989
-I'm just the shadowy figure
that lurks in the background.

32:30.698 --> 32:32.825
Do you wanna have dinner,
AUSA Valdes?

32:39.123 --> 32:40.583
8'o clock?

32:40.667 --> 32:42.835
Listen, do you know anybody
that can launder money?

32:42.919 --> 32:44.963
Oh, don't-- Don't ask me
shit like that, okay?

32:45.046 --> 32:46.255
I'm just saying.

32:46.339 --> 32:47.757
You got a guy
for a lot of things.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.176
You know I'm not supposed to be
seen anywhere near you.

32:50.259 --> 32:53.763
-Th-- The bar committee hasn't
even rendered a decision.
-Oh, my God.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.556
This fucking
bar committee shit.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.392
When you gonna realize
there's a million ways

32:57.475 --> 33:00.687
-for you to make money if you
can't be a lawyer no more?

33:00.770 --> 33:02.522
I didn't say all that now.

33:03.314 --> 33:06.693
-I looked into Teresi
like you asked.
-Okay.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.069
Everything seems to check out.

33:08.778 --> 33:10.738
Him getting out looks legit.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.198
All right.

33:12.281 --> 33:14.367
So he ain't a snitch
or nothing?

33:14.450 --> 33:16.285
Not as far as I could see.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.621
He's a made man.

33:18.705 --> 33:21.416
If he was talking to the feds,
they would have him
in WITSEC...

33:21.499 --> 33:23.459
-Yeah.
-Long before he could catch
two to the base of his skull.

33:23.543 --> 33:26.421
-I know, no.
You right. You right.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.925
Look, if you suspect anything,
let me know.

33:31.217 --> 33:32.802
In the meantime,

33:32.885 --> 33:34.929
we should stay
far out of touch.

33:35.346 --> 33:39.267
So could you try
not to call
when you need stuff?

33:42.228 --> 33:43.563
I'm serious.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.112
Hey, yo, Dre.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.864
It's about 300 grand tonight.

33:52.947 --> 33:54.490
I got it with me.

33:54.574 --> 33:55.867
I'll see you in the morning.

34:15.011 --> 34:17.847
Give me the keys
or I'll shoot you right
in your fucking head.

34:17.930 --> 34:19.223
Easy.

34:19.307 --> 34:20.808
Take it easy.
You don't wanna do this.

34:22.101 --> 34:24.145
You're making a big mistake.
You know who the fuck I am?

34:24.228 --> 34:25.313
You think I give a fuck?

34:26.856 --> 34:28.775
I said give me the keys,
and your phone.

34:39.410 --> 34:42.038
That mask's not gonna stop me
from finding out who you are.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.457
Keep playing with me, bitch.

34:54.550 --> 34:55.927
So, James,

34:57.053 --> 34:59.764
what do you have
that's gonna make me
change my mind.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.684
Ah.

35:04.185 --> 35:06.604
-The Queens Child Project...

35:06.687 --> 35:09.607
It's not only personal to me
because I wanna
erect a monument

35:09.690 --> 35:10.817
to my daughter Raina...

35:10.900 --> 35:13.778
-Mmm-hmm.
-But also because
I grew up in that community.

35:15.321 --> 35:17.365
I was one of the lucky ones
that made it out.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.950
But I saw a lot of violence.

35:20.034 --> 35:22.620
I tried to protect my kids
from it, and I failed.

35:24.247 --> 35:26.624
And you really think
you're gonna
change the whole area around?

35:26.707 --> 35:29.710
I mean, the project
is just one building.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.504
Well, if I were you,
I would start buying buildings

35:31.587 --> 35:34.966
in the surrounding area, Linda,
fast as I can.

35:35.049 --> 35:38.052
I just need an anchor
to make a difference.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.345
You're so confident.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.348
I know what I'm capable of.

35:46.352 --> 35:48.604
Why don't we, uh,

35:48.688 --> 35:50.982
continue this
conversation upstairs?

35:53.276 --> 35:54.485
Okay.

35:57.947 --> 35:59.490
And, uh, James?

36:00.575 --> 36:01.951
Bring the bottle.

36:47.663 --> 36:49.957
The job's ruined
a few of my relationships.

36:50.583 --> 36:54.295
Being a boss means having more
enemies than friends at work.

36:56.088 --> 36:58.883
So what's your first win
gonna be, boss?

37:01.844 --> 37:02.970
I can't say much,

37:04.138 --> 37:07.767
but I got a lead
on the Jimenez cartel.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.477
The Jimenez?

37:09.560 --> 37:10.603
Fuck, good for you.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.231
Been trying to nail
those guys for years.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.440
Mmm.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.861
Let me buy you a drink

37:18.945 --> 37:20.279
in my hotel.

37:22.865 --> 37:24.075
Thanks.

37:24.784 --> 37:27.161
But I've got
an early day tomorrow.

37:29.372 --> 37:31.791
Well, if you, uh,
change your mind,

37:32.333 --> 37:35.002
I'll be in town just
for one more night.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.845
Do I need to explain
anything to her?

37:44.929 --> 37:48.266
No, that's exactly the point.
Her investigation's
gone too far.

37:48.349 --> 37:49.392
Shut it down.

37:54.730 --> 37:56.357
You need to get that?

37:56.440 --> 37:57.984
No.

37:58.067 --> 38:00.194
So I'd like this
to happen right away.

38:02.071 --> 38:03.322
Got it.

38:06.075 --> 38:09.412
-So I let Tommy think
I had a man coming over, right?
-Mmm-hmm.

38:09.495 --> 38:12.081
But it was just TeNaya
bringing samples from the shop.

38:12.999 --> 38:15.251
-But he didn't know that.

38:15.334 --> 38:17.420
'Keisha, you ain't changed
since the eighth grade.

38:17.503 --> 38:19.505
I am not gonna go
back there again.

38:19.588 --> 38:22.174
Nah.
I can't.

38:22.258 --> 38:23.968
So why you let him in?

38:24.051 --> 38:25.970
'Cause you know,
if you let him in now,

38:26.053 --> 38:28.431
you're gonna be
letting him in later.

38:28.514 --> 38:30.224
No, I'm not.

38:31.225 --> 38:33.060
He tried to kiss me
and I stopped him.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.271
All right,
well, just be careful.

38:35.980 --> 38:40.109
Because Tommy
is not himself lately.

38:40.735 --> 38:44.447
I mean, I guess
none of us are.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.075
How's 'Riq doing?

38:50.828 --> 38:52.413
Honestly, I don't know.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.459
I don't know who he is now.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.342
I--
I just still feel like

39:04.425 --> 39:07.345
he isn't telling me everything
that happened, you know?

39:07.428 --> 39:09.305
I mean, I don't know
how he got that way.

39:10.222 --> 39:11.474
I do.

39:12.224 --> 39:15.311
Tasha, you've been lying
to them kids they whole life.

39:15.394 --> 39:17.438
They don't even know
who you are.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.148
What you expect?

39:19.231 --> 39:20.733
They can't learn
what they don't see.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.988
Tash.
I'm sorry.

39:27.114 --> 39:28.699
I'm sorry, that was harsh.

39:28.783 --> 39:29.867
No.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.704
You're right.

39:36.165 --> 39:37.458
It's the truth.

39:38.793 --> 39:42.588
All I'm saying is,
if you want things
to be different,

39:43.422 --> 39:45.633
then you gotta
make 'em different.

39:58.979 --> 40:00.022
Tommy.

40:00.106 --> 40:01.482
Ma, what the fuck
are you doing here?

40:01.565 --> 40:03.234
-Oh, my Lord.

40:03.317 --> 40:04.902
So much sadness.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.613
Poor Rhonda.
I can't believe what happened.

40:07.696 --> 40:09.865
-Jamie's daughter.

40:10.157 --> 40:12.118
I made them this casserole,
because, you know,

40:12.201 --> 40:15.121
people like to eat
when they're grieving.
When's the funeral?

40:15.204 --> 40:19.041
-Well, Ma, Raina's funeral
was a few days ago.
-Ah.

40:19.125 --> 40:20.835
And I-- I haven't talked to you
since before that.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.253
Has it been that long?
-Yeah.

40:22.336 --> 40:24.380
-Yeah, about that long.
-Gosh, I must be
losing my mind.

40:24.463 --> 40:27.133
-Hey, honey, um.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.593
-My supply is a little low.
-Oh...

40:29.677 --> 40:31.053
Do you think you
could help me out?

40:31.137 --> 40:34.723
I fuckin' should've known!

40:34.807 --> 40:36.434
Have you actually
lost your mind?

40:36.517 --> 40:38.602
Can I finally put you
in a home?

40:38.686 --> 40:42.064
Is this about
the birth certificate?
Huh?

40:42.148 --> 40:44.984
Oh, you're still seeing
that shithead, Teresi?

40:48.362 --> 40:50.239
-He's getting
an early release.

40:53.534 --> 40:54.785
What's he asking you for?

40:54.869 --> 40:57.371
Nothin', Ma.
He ain't asking me for nothin'.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.832
He ain't asking you
for nothing yet.

40:59.915 --> 41:01.792
He's the devil, Tommy.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.043
He's gonna use you.

41:03.919 --> 41:05.087
Just like you use me?

41:05.171 --> 41:06.255
For coke?

41:07.256 --> 41:10.259
My son is smarter than this.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.553
Just you wait.

41:12.636 --> 41:13.721
I'll be right.

41:14.346 --> 41:15.973
Love you.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.146
Yo, Dre, I called you.

41:22.229 --> 41:23.647
Cristobal got hit
outside the Blind Pig.

41:24.106 --> 41:25.566
He already told me, man.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.527
You fucked up when you
gave him that shit, Dre.

41:28.611 --> 41:31.197
If it was me and Spanky,
only way them motherfuckers
would've left was in body bags.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.698
Look, man, we'll talk
about this later.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.742
I got other shit
I gotta handle.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.619
All right, listen up.

41:37.578 --> 41:40.623
We got some changes
I need to make official.

41:40.706 --> 41:43.375
I'm focused on our
international network.

41:43.459 --> 41:47.213
So here at home,
Cristobal is officially
my number two.

41:47.630 --> 41:48.797
He's running shit.

41:48.881 --> 41:51.258
So if you need anything,
come to him first.

41:52.968 --> 41:54.512
Listen, we got hit last night.

41:55.095 --> 41:57.848
So as a precaution,
we gonna switch up the drops.

41:57.932 --> 41:59.558
You got a question for Dre,

42:00.768 --> 42:04.230
-you come and see me first.
Man...

42:04.313 --> 42:05.481
How old are you, man?

42:05.773 --> 42:07.733
Yo, man, you got
a fucking problem with me?

42:07.816 --> 42:09.151
I'm not gonna report to you

42:09.235 --> 42:12.321
like some motherfucking vice
principal, you feel me, man?

42:12.404 --> 42:15.991
It's my call.
If you don't like it,
you can get the fuck out.

42:16.075 --> 42:17.243
Do you feel me?

42:24.124 --> 42:25.834
I really don't give a fuck,
all right?

42:28.629 --> 42:29.755
So we good?

42:31.090 --> 42:32.299
Yeah, we're good. Good.

42:34.260 --> 42:35.344
Good.

42:38.556 --> 42:39.682
We good.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.270
All right.

42:56.448 --> 42:57.741
What's going on?

42:57.825 --> 42:59.952
I'm Agent Jerry Donovan, FBI.

43:00.035 --> 43:02.121
We'd like your assistance
in gathering all the files

43:02.204 --> 43:04.456
associated with
the Raymond Jones murder.

43:04.540 --> 43:07.918
I have a court order stating
that your investigation
is now under our jurisdiction.

43:08.002 --> 43:10.170
Bullshit.
Let me see that order.

43:16.802 --> 43:18.554
Angela Valdes?

43:18.637 --> 43:19.930
I should've fuckin' known.

43:20.014 --> 43:22.057
Your boss is
covering her ass, you know.

43:22.141 --> 43:24.351
-She's involved.

43:26.395 --> 43:27.438
No.

43:27.521 --> 43:28.689
Then just stay out of our way.

43:32.276 --> 43:34.737
This is all we have
from Mexico.

43:34.820 --> 43:36.947
Okay. We've known this one
for a while,

43:37.031 --> 43:38.365
Diego Jimenez.

43:38.866 --> 43:42.328
What we don't know is
who the fuck are all these men,

43:42.411 --> 43:44.747
and are any of them
related to Diego?

43:44.830 --> 43:48.042
Well, these two might be
his bodyguards,
'cause we see them everywhere.

43:48.542 --> 43:51.629
Except when they're
following her, Alicia.

43:54.423 --> 43:55.758
Do you think
she's some kind of,

43:55.841 --> 43:59.428
I don't know,
spokesperson for the cartel
when Diego can't be in Mexico?

43:59.511 --> 44:00.888
What do you mean?

44:00.971 --> 44:04.516
The way she's surrounded
when he's not around.

44:04.600 --> 44:08.228
I don't know, it's as if she's,
like, the number two
in the organization.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.606
Honestly, we don't have a lot
of details on her, all right?

44:10.689 --> 44:13.359
Diego is a party animal.
Chicks all over the place.

44:14.318 --> 44:17.154
Maybe she's got his balls
in some sort of vice.

44:17.237 --> 44:19.948
I think she's in
a real position of power.

44:22.743 --> 44:24.870
The Jimenez brothers.

44:27.247 --> 44:29.208
Oh, my God.
Oh, my fucking God.

44:29.291 --> 44:31.794
-We're idiots.
-Uh, speak for yourself.

44:31.877 --> 44:35.339
<i>Los Hermanos Jimenez.</i>
Sure, <i>"hermanos"</i>
means "brothers."

44:35.422 --> 44:37.424
"Sisters," <i>"hermanas."</i>
But how do you say siblings?

44:37.508 --> 44:40.386
How do you say both
brother and sister?

44:40.469 --> 44:42.721
Oh, shit.
<i>"Hermanos."</i>

44:42.805 --> 44:43.972
Jesus.

44:44.056 --> 44:47.017
This Alicia is Diego's sister?

44:47.101 --> 44:50.979
-If that's true--
-Then we have the leaders
of the biggest cartel

44:51.063 --> 44:53.524
in North America
in New York City right now.

44:54.525 --> 44:57.528
Arresting them could end
their entire organization

44:57.611 --> 44:59.363
with no
jurisdictional bullshit.

45:00.406 --> 45:03.200
All right, gentlemen,
let's get our warrants.

45:07.704 --> 45:08.914
There he is,
councilman.

45:08.997 --> 45:10.416
-Hey.
-Hey.

45:11.583 --> 45:13.127
So, Linda's happy,

45:13.210 --> 45:15.629
and she's back on board.

45:16.380 --> 45:17.798
How'd you pull that off?

45:17.881 --> 45:20.300
We had dinner.
Sorted it out.

45:21.301 --> 45:23.512
Ah.

45:23.595 --> 45:26.682
You smooth talkin' her.
Spit some game.

45:26.765 --> 45:28.308
Then dropped the dick on her.

45:29.893 --> 45:31.728
That what you call
"sorting it out?"

45:33.021 --> 45:34.857
You know, after our meeting,

45:34.940 --> 45:37.776
her major concern was
your lack of professionalism.

45:37.860 --> 45:39.862
All you managed to do
by fucking her

45:39.945 --> 45:42.072
is prove she was right
to have concern.

45:42.865 --> 45:45.784
-She played me.
-You played yourself, James.

45:46.201 --> 45:47.953
And you're enjoying this.

45:48.036 --> 45:50.998
Maybe you should start
taking my advice.

45:51.081 --> 45:53.459
Lesson one,
I'm not your pimp.

45:53.876 --> 45:55.669
Did you not pimp out
me and Tasha

45:55.752 --> 45:57.463
with that little
press conference stunt, huh?

45:57.713 --> 46:00.632
Did you not pimp my daughter--
my dead daughter
at her funeral?

46:01.091 --> 46:03.218
James.
We...

46:05.095 --> 46:06.597
We still have
a lot of business.

46:07.556 --> 46:09.975
Our big fundraiser
is in a few days.

46:11.101 --> 46:13.145
Let's not let this go sour now.

46:15.564 --> 46:17.024
I'll get the money.

46:18.400 --> 46:19.818
Whatever it takes.

46:22.070 --> 46:24.114
That's the spirit.
Mmm.

46:24.698 --> 46:27.618
Damn, I'm glad you called.
I thought I struck out.

46:30.329 --> 46:31.914
No, that wasn't about you.

46:32.664 --> 46:35.417
-Just, you know, had to work.
-Mmm.

46:35.501 --> 46:38.170
And since you said you'd be
here one more night,

46:38.253 --> 46:40.923
-I figured...

46:41.006 --> 46:42.925
Ah, let me guess, work.

46:49.139 --> 46:50.724
Yes.

46:52.059 --> 46:54.478
Hey.
Let me see.

46:54.978 --> 46:56.480
Let me see.

47:23.590 --> 47:25.551
-Ignore it.

47:25.634 --> 47:28.804
-My boss will freak out

47:28.887 --> 47:30.556
if she can't reach me.

47:36.019 --> 47:37.396
Do you have to take it?

47:42.025 --> 47:43.068
So where were we?

47:50.075 --> 47:51.493
<i> This is Angela Valdes.</i>

47:51.577 --> 47:53.078
<i>I can't take</i>
<i>your call right now.</i>

47:53.161 --> 47:54.538
<i>Please leave your</i>
<i>message after--</i>

48:08.885 --> 48:10.220
What's up?

48:10.304 --> 48:12.264
<i>Tommy, what up?</i>
<i>Um...</i>

48:12.347 --> 48:13.974
<i>Look, man, I've been thinking.</i>

48:15.642 --> 48:18.687
I need clean money
to help me finance the QCP,

48:18.770 --> 48:20.397
and you need clean money
to pay Jason back.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.316
So I think we should go back
to our old arrangement

48:22.399 --> 48:23.567
that worked so well, at Truth.

48:24.610 --> 48:26.695
So how's that work?
You take a cut?

48:26.778 --> 48:29.031
<i>A service fee,</i>
<i>but we can into the details</i>

48:29.114 --> 48:30.699
<i>later, if you're down.</i>

48:30.782 --> 48:32.993
So, like old times.

48:33.452 --> 48:35.704
Yeah, like old times.

48:37.414 --> 48:39.333
But Tommy, if we're gonna
work together now...

48:39.416 --> 48:40.959
<i>I gotta make sure that</i>

48:41.043 --> 48:42.711
<i>you not fucking</i>
<i>with Kanan in business,</i>

48:42.794 --> 48:45.255
<i>'cause if you are, man,</i>
<i>I-- I gotta be out.</i>

48:47.799 --> 48:48.842
<i>Tommy?</i>

48:49.176 --> 48:50.969
<i> Yo, Ghost,</i>
<i>let me call you right back.</i>

48:51.053 --> 48:52.220
Later.

49:05.233 --> 49:06.610
Yo, what's up, K?

49:06.693 --> 49:07.819
What's in the bag?

49:08.445 --> 49:09.821
1/4 mil, up front.

49:10.155 --> 49:11.365
You gonna cut me in or not?

49:14.159 --> 49:16.078
I'll have it ready
for you tomorrow.

49:16.870 --> 49:18.205
That's what's up.

49:19.456 --> 49:20.707
Yo, you want a beer?

49:21.500 --> 49:23.251
Yo, you all right in here?

49:23.335 --> 49:25.837
Yeah, this old mobster I know
is getting out the joint.

49:25.921 --> 49:28.507
-Good for him.
-Yeah, I don't know.
I don't trust it.

49:28.590 --> 49:30.676
He was serving life,
now he's getting out?

49:30.759 --> 49:32.386
That's the same shit
happen to me, remember?

49:32.469 --> 49:34.846
Yeah, but I think
he's a snitch.

49:34.930 --> 49:37.683
-Maybe.
-Mobsters who snitch
ain't in jail.

49:37.766 --> 49:40.018
Well.

49:40.102 --> 49:42.270
Why you give a fuck?
He know some shit about you?

49:46.483 --> 49:47.776
He's my dad.

49:48.610 --> 49:50.195
Shit, you Mafia?

49:50.278 --> 49:52.072
That's how you know
the Italians?

49:52.155 --> 49:53.532
So this means you're gonna
get us, like,

49:53.615 --> 49:55.283
Armani suits
and shit like that?

49:55.367 --> 49:57.786
Would you stop, K?
Man, you play too much.

49:57.869 --> 49:59.621
So when you find out
you got a dad?

49:59.705 --> 50:02.416
I don't know.
Not long ago.

50:05.585 --> 50:07.087
So don't trip
and don't waste it.

50:07.170 --> 50:10.382
I ain't never had one.
I don't know, go to
the ball game or some shit.

50:10.465 --> 50:11.883
Fuck you, man.

50:11.967 --> 50:13.802
Y'all could play catch
or something.

50:27.899 --> 50:29.943
Well, here we are.

50:30.026 --> 50:31.278
This is Choate.

50:32.404 --> 50:33.488
It's big.

50:34.156 --> 50:35.365
Mmm-hmm.

50:36.616 --> 50:38.201
'Riq, wait.

50:39.786 --> 50:41.413
There's something
I gotta say to you.

50:45.417 --> 50:46.543
I'm sorry.

50:48.170 --> 50:49.212
Sorry for what?

50:53.049 --> 50:54.926
I'm sorry for lying to you

50:56.011 --> 50:57.304
all this time.

50:58.555 --> 50:59.973
You deserve the truth.

51:03.143 --> 51:04.394
Your dad and I,

51:06.021 --> 51:07.397
we grew up in Queens

51:07.481 --> 51:08.774
in the hood.

51:09.524 --> 51:11.401
I mean, it was a hard life.

51:12.569 --> 51:15.405
And-- And we just wanted to
protect you kids from that.

51:15.489 --> 51:17.574
I mean, people who
grew up like we did,

51:17.657 --> 51:19.409
they didn't have
a lot of options, 'Riq.

51:20.535 --> 51:22.746
And selling drugs was just

51:22.829 --> 51:24.790
a way to keep your head
above water,

51:24.873 --> 51:26.166
nothing more.

51:26.666 --> 51:28.376
But you make a lot of money.

51:28.668 --> 51:30.295
Not when you're a corner boy.

51:32.380 --> 51:35.008
When I met your father,
I knew he was different.

51:37.260 --> 51:40.138
We didn't get everything we got
'cause he was a drug dealer.

51:40.222 --> 51:42.224
He was always
a businessman first.

51:45.977 --> 51:48.104
Look, we always said that

51:49.606 --> 51:52.776
we didn't want our kids
to ever have to feel

51:52.859 --> 51:55.362
the hunger that we felt.

51:56.571 --> 51:59.783
We didn't want you to know
what the streets were like.

52:02.869 --> 52:04.496
So that's why
you didn't tell us.

52:08.542 --> 52:09.709
Yeah.

52:09.793 --> 52:10.836
I mean, it--

52:10.919 --> 52:12.712
It wasn't a lie, 'Riq.

52:12.796 --> 52:14.339
Not the way you think. It--

52:15.715 --> 52:16.925
it was a hope,

52:18.301 --> 52:20.637
a hope that
you wouldn't have to know.

52:21.805 --> 52:22.848
I mean, we--

52:22.931 --> 52:25.308
We thought we were
protecting you.

52:26.935 --> 52:28.395
But all we did was

52:29.729 --> 52:31.231
teach you how to lie.

52:34.401 --> 52:36.278
Baby, I'm so sorry.

52:44.077 --> 52:45.579
I'm sorry.

52:48.957 --> 52:50.166
I was scared.

52:53.086 --> 52:54.296
I saw...

52:54.796 --> 52:56.756
I saw Ray Ray shoot Raina.

53:00.260 --> 53:01.469
What...

53:01.553 --> 53:03.722
I didn't know
she followed me outside.

53:05.891 --> 53:07.893
I was hiding from Ray Ray and

53:07.976 --> 53:09.769
I-- I heard her voice.

53:10.645 --> 53:12.230
And I looked and

53:12.314 --> 53:13.481
there she goes.

53:14.983 --> 53:16.109
And she...

53:17.152 --> 53:18.904
It just happened so fast.

53:20.572 --> 53:22.824
I told her I--
I would handle it, but

53:24.784 --> 53:26.077
I watched.

53:29.414 --> 53:30.540
I watched her die.

53:33.460 --> 53:35.128
I miss her so much.

53:35.211 --> 53:36.630
I miss her too.

54:00.028 --> 54:01.446
Open the gate.

54:41.736 --> 54:43.029
Hey.

54:44.906 --> 54:46.074
Tommy.

54:46.157 --> 54:47.617
Hey.

54:47.701 --> 54:49.536
Welcome back to the other side.

54:51.955 --> 54:53.123
Breathe it in.

54:53.206 --> 54:54.290
It's good to see you, son.

54:55.250 --> 54:56.418
It's good to see you too.

54:58.378 --> 54:59.587
Come on.

55:00.505 --> 55:01.798
Yeah.

55:06.886 --> 55:08.930
Come on.
Get in the car.

55:11.349 --> 55:13.852
-Let's get the fuck
out of here.

55:14.227 --> 55:15.770
This is a nice ride.

55:22.569 --> 55:24.904
So, what you wanna do?

55:25.655 --> 55:27.032
Let's get a slice and go home.

55:27.115 --> 55:28.742
I wanna see Connie.

55:29.409 --> 55:30.577
Then you and me,

55:31.619 --> 55:33.413
we're gonna get
into some trouble.
