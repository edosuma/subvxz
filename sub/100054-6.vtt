01:51.228 --> 01:53.100
Skin Deep by Sloan.

01:53.353 --> 01:56.583
Since the beginning of time, man has
been obsessed with his own image.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.708
And now, with our new
body sculpting technique,

01:58.725 --> 02:00.457
that image can be perfected.

02:00.636 --> 02:01.904
- What's the secret you ask?
- _

02:01.936 --> 02:03.055
- Does it really work?
- _

02:03.083 --> 02:05.634
As you can see, our results
speak for themselves.

02:06.076 --> 02:08.549
This is Debbie before
the Skin Deep treatment.

02:08.740 --> 02:11.078
And this is Debbie three days later.

02:11.773 --> 02:14.900
Skin Deep by Sloan
helped change my life.

02:14.933 --> 02:17.555
Now, I'm here to help change yours.

02:17.622 --> 02:20.975
A 100% painless, completely
natural procedure.

02:20.997 --> 02:23.227
Skin Deep by Sloan is
the biggest breakthrough

02:23.245 --> 02:24.581
in body management history.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.789
Hi, I'm Dr. Herbert Sloan,

02:26.790 --> 02:30.670
and I promise, you'll have the
perfect body that you deserve.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.865
Skin Deep by Sloan,

02:35.243 --> 02:37.505
feel the miracle and see the difference.

02:39.263 --> 02:40.346
Wow!

02:40.815 --> 02:42.613
You're Debbie from the TV!

02:42.667 --> 02:43.749
May I help you?

02:43.750 --> 02:46.269
I'm Henry Quill. I got an email.

02:47.220 --> 02:49.327
Here you are, Mr. Quill.

02:49.341 --> 02:52.021
We want to thank you for being such
a loyal customer over the years.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.681
It says here you've
been a steady consumer

02:53.705 --> 02:55.235
of Dr. Sloan's previous products.

02:55.260 --> 02:57.779
Well, I've eaten my share
of his Ginkgo biloba pills.

02:57.820 --> 02:59.225
Which is why Dr. Sloan...

02:59.267 --> 03:01.666
You would be perfect to be
one of the first presented

03:01.680 --> 03:04.019
- with this more effective treatment.
- Okay.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.809
The doctor will be right with you.

03:05.833 --> 03:06.846
Skin Deep by Sloan.

03:06.847 --> 03:09.255
Mr. Simmons, you can come on back.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.671
_

03:21.226 --> 03:22.322
Hi.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.460
I'm Henry.

03:29.660 --> 03:30.764
Kelly.

03:34.434 --> 03:36.060
It's kind of mysterious.

03:36.511 --> 03:38.676
It's like we're gonna
meet the real Dr. Sloan.

03:39.275 --> 03:41.107
I don't care if he is Dr. Seuss,

03:41.167 --> 03:43.180
as long as he can make me look like her.

03:50.705 --> 03:52.551
Welcome, everybody.

03:52.552 --> 03:57.006
I'm Herbert Sloan with the skin
deep solution for every... body.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.419
I see what you did there.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.781
Please, come gather round
right over here, friends.

04:04.481 --> 04:05.904
Ah, don't be shy.

04:07.586 --> 04:09.833
Like magic, Mr. Simmons. It's a new you.

04:09.872 --> 04:11.122
That's impossible.

04:11.146 --> 04:12.479
Check out that guy.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.933
Wow, he's so skinny.

04:14.218 --> 04:15.379
How is that possible?

04:15.403 --> 04:16.478
How do they do that?

04:16.480 --> 04:18.233
- He looks great.
- Ah...

04:18.480 --> 04:19.690
Donuts anyone?

04:19.694 --> 04:22.536
I thought this was about
losing weight not gaining it.

04:22.537 --> 04:25.147
It is, but after a sit-in with me,

04:25.161 --> 04:28.131
- you'll never have to diet again.
- Hmm, we'll see.

04:29.278 --> 04:30.807
Maybe just one.

04:32.429 --> 04:33.429
One.

04:33.503 --> 04:36.142
My new procedure will work on you.

04:36.579 --> 04:39.108
And you, and you, and you.

04:40.181 --> 04:43.120
Trust me, you've never
seen anything like this.

04:43.220 --> 04:46.694
My success rate is an
unprecedented 100%.

04:55.220 --> 04:58.039
Everyone knows there's
no fountain of youth.

04:58.062 --> 05:00.287
But, it doesn't stop us from looking.

05:01.885 --> 05:05.523
Man has been obsessed with his own
image since the beginning of time.

05:06.240 --> 05:09.287
And now, that image can be perfected.

05:09.411 --> 05:13.411
_

05:16.597 --> 05:17.813
What is that?!

05:18.716 --> 05:22.234
Since 2012, my team and I
have collected 10 specimens

05:22.257 --> 05:25.495
from a water intake
reservoir in South America.

05:26.384 --> 05:29.036
To think, I was combing
the Brazilian rainforest

05:29.037 --> 05:31.134
searching for fat-melting berries,

05:31.165 --> 05:33.772
when I discovered
something so much more.

05:37.242 --> 05:39.800
Beautiful, isn't it?

05:39.972 --> 05:41.446
From this expedition,

05:41.463 --> 05:45.281
we concluded that a high number of
these large female Anguilliformes

05:45.320 --> 05:47.169
were effectively trapped
in the reservoir,

05:47.186 --> 05:49.242
unable to complete their
breeding migration.

05:49.280 --> 05:52.672
- Anguilla-what? Is it an eel?
- In a way.

05:52.940 --> 05:54.831
And you'd be surprised to learn

05:54.854 --> 05:57.871
how many species there still are
to be discovered on this planet.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.950
We've learned after extensive testing

06:00.995 --> 06:03.380
that it's an advanced form of a leech.

06:03.505 --> 06:06.052
But, with one major distinction.

06:06.386 --> 06:08.586
This one, doesn't drink blood.

06:09.645 --> 06:12.184
Once attached, it secretes a fluid

06:12.203 --> 06:14.219
that completely numbs
the patient's skin.

06:14.220 --> 06:17.361
Then the creature painlessly
uses its saliva...

06:17.390 --> 06:21.322
- It eats fat!
- To put it simply, Kelly, yes.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.032
It completely liquefies it.

06:23.060 --> 06:25.520
It absorbs excess adipose
stored within fat cells.

06:25.525 --> 06:29.146
Nothing else is removed,
of course. Just fat.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.776
- Of course.
- Think about it.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.880
Diet and exercise are
a thing of the past.

06:35.231 --> 06:38.184
Believe me when I tell
you, it's indisputable.

06:39.117 --> 06:40.937
Never again in our lifetime

06:40.960 --> 06:44.300
will we witness a truer
undiscovered miracle of nature.

06:44.425 --> 06:46.193
Take my money.

06:47.287 --> 06:49.417
Follow me please.

06:57.807 --> 06:59.085
Henry?

07:00.605 --> 07:02.804
You're not putting that thing on me.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.080
Just hear me out.

07:06.205 --> 07:08.047
Okay? No hard sell. This is me to you.

07:08.072 --> 07:10.035
But why me? You don't even know me.

07:10.036 --> 07:11.383
But I do.

07:12.601 --> 07:14.774
I was you once.

07:14.899 --> 07:16.469
And look at me now.

07:16.924 --> 07:19.960
I've got FDA approval,
had countless trials.

07:20.413 --> 07:22.981
Look, total transparency.

07:22.998 --> 07:25.888
I've sunk every dime I have into this.

07:26.140 --> 07:29.140
And would I put it all on the
line if it wasn't completely safe?

07:29.320 --> 07:31.535
Let me change your life.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.762
And I'm supposed to believe that no one

07:33.768 --> 07:36.365
has come across this animal until now?

07:36.490 --> 07:39.267
It's incredibly rare, for starters.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.949
We searched for months
and only found 10.

07:41.950 --> 07:43.971
10! Still,

07:44.011 --> 07:47.529
I braved uncharted territory
and I'll reap the rewards. But,

07:47.562 --> 07:50.252
trust me, we all win here.

07:55.519 --> 07:58.611
I'm sorry. It's too freaky for me.

07:59.008 --> 08:00.863
I really can't do this.

08:01.341 --> 08:03.885
And, uh, good luck.

08:09.636 --> 08:11.559
_

08:12.153 --> 08:15.090
Alright, here we go.
That will be $10.37.

08:15.619 --> 08:17.484
We'll take the next in line. Sir?

08:17.991 --> 08:19.480
What can I get for you?

08:23.360 --> 08:26.126
Wow, have you been working
out. You look great.

08:26.846 --> 08:29.822
- And you're up.
- Just finished working out.

08:30.663 --> 08:32.258
Hey, look.

08:32.558 --> 08:34.254
Would you like a drink with that?

08:34.279 --> 08:37.082
So this is where you disappeared to.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.004
Kelly?

08:41.880 --> 08:43.760
- Is that you?
- Mm-hmm.

08:43.831 --> 08:46.802
- It works.
- It's only been two weeks.

08:46.840 --> 08:49.353
And Sloan hired me to
be his spokesmodel.

08:49.478 --> 08:52.778
- Can you believe that?
- You look... fantastic.

08:53.320 --> 08:54.913
You really did it?

08:55.140 --> 08:58.915
- With the worm and the suck-it?
- Totally painless.

08:58.926 --> 09:00.225
Just like Sloan said.

09:00.251 --> 09:02.500
A sip here, a sip there.

09:02.513 --> 09:03.840
It's a miracle.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.282
Ohh, and he asked me to help
introduce him on AM America tomorrow.

09:07.328 --> 09:09.359
You're gonna be, you're
gonna be on the show?

09:09.360 --> 09:12.077
Yeah. I can get you a couple of tickets.

09:12.660 --> 09:15.924
Well... Just one ticket, right?

09:16.049 --> 09:18.866
There is no plus one for a plus three.

09:19.465 --> 09:21.024
- Order up!
- Hey,

09:21.669 --> 09:23.903
why don't you come be our volunteer?

09:24.240 --> 09:26.447
Oh, come on, Henry.

09:26.488 --> 09:28.549
Opportunity knocks twice.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.639
Henry.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.840
Everybody's doing it.

09:33.201 --> 09:35.815
- Order number 14.
- That's me.

09:36.414 --> 09:37.916
Ta-ta.

09:51.671 --> 09:55.286
Is there anything I can get
you? Water? Some donuts?

09:55.338 --> 09:56.895
No, I had a box.

09:56.927 --> 09:58.874
We're really happy you're here, Henry.

09:58.891 --> 10:01.482
Dr. Sloan is so excited to
see your transformation.

10:01.510 --> 10:03.018
- Yeah.
- Are you excited?

10:03.053 --> 10:04.280
A little terrified.

10:04.300 --> 10:07.060
Oh, so was I when I did it
but it's nothing, really.

10:08.010 --> 10:09.536
- See that man right there?
- Yeah.

10:09.541 --> 10:11.377
He owns the station. He did it,

10:11.412 --> 10:13.404
loved it, half the crewmen too.

10:13.421 --> 10:15.408
Wow, all these people.
That's incredible.

10:15.430 --> 10:19.052
Quiet on set, we're
going live in 3, 2...

10:21.269 --> 10:25.310
- Good morning. It's time for...
- AM America Live.

10:25.322 --> 10:27.692
Today, we have a big show.

10:27.699 --> 10:30.154
After months of secrecy and speculation,

10:30.161 --> 10:33.910
Dr. Herbert Sloan is here
to unveil his top secret

10:33.932 --> 10:36.724
body sculpting technique
due to be made available

10:36.732 --> 10:38.975
to the public in just four days.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.114
Maybe I should try it
on my love handles.

10:42.228 --> 10:45.420
But first, the celestial
event on everyone's mind,

10:45.440 --> 10:48.650
the big solar eclipse,
happening this morning.

10:48.960 --> 10:52.133
It's being called the next
Great American Eclipse.

10:52.168 --> 10:54.626
- It's so exciting.
- And we've got our own

10:54.647 --> 10:56.460
roving science expert, Jim Scott,

10:56.475 --> 10:59.886
standing by at the Horlicks
Observatory to tell us all about it.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.575
Hey, Jim!

11:01.760 --> 11:03.260
Morning Randy and Suzy.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.680
Hope you're not afraid of the dark,

11:04.704 --> 11:07.600
because this may be the most
spectacular eclipse of our lifetime.

11:07.620 --> 11:10.871
It's estimated to last no
longer than 160 seconds.

11:10.890 --> 11:12.130
But during that time, I'm told,

11:12.154 --> 11:14.607
this would be seen across
the entire United States,

11:14.720 --> 11:17.000
something that hasn't
happened for almost a century.

11:17.020 --> 11:19.669
Now, that sounds spooky.
Anything to worry about?

11:19.670 --> 11:21.425
Not so much. But if you have pets,

11:21.426 --> 11:22.977
you might want to keep an eye on them.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.892
Sometimes, our furred
and feathered friends

11:24.906 --> 11:26.808
get a little jumpy during an eclipse.

11:26.845 --> 11:28.429
Uh. Now, why is that?

11:28.480 --> 11:31.791
Well, there's been speculation
that abnormal animal behavior

11:31.814 --> 11:33.739
results in increase magnetic field flows

11:33.758 --> 11:35.669
during a solar eclipse
of this magnitude.

11:35.720 --> 11:38.312
- I don't know what that means!
- Me neither.

11:38.501 --> 11:41.004
Thanks, Jim. Let us know
when it starts to get dark.

11:41.005 --> 11:43.378
Well, and keeping with
our science theme,

11:43.388 --> 11:45.322
we would like to welcome Dr. Sloan,

11:45.354 --> 11:47.300
with Skin Deep by Sloan.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.179
Thank you. It's great to be here.

11:49.180 --> 11:52.580
Now, I understand you're going to be
performing this miracle procedure,

11:52.620 --> 11:55.564
right here in this studio,
in a matter of minutes.

11:55.640 --> 11:58.795
Randy, I think it's safe to
say that you will be amazed.

11:58.860 --> 12:02.862
Well, we will see right
after this message.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.547
- Clear! We're back in 90, folks.
- Thank you.

12:06.672 --> 12:08.706
- Hey.
- We'll be right over.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.725
I guess this is it.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.201
You nervous?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.500
You know, all my life,

12:14.540 --> 12:17.405
I've struggled with negative body image.

12:17.669 --> 12:20.272
Diet pills, fat burners,
I've tried everything.

12:20.820 --> 12:22.230
And now...

12:22.360 --> 12:23.847
with one big slurp...

12:24.260 --> 12:26.270
all my problems are gonna be gone.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.202
Hey, I can have a dating life.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.902
Trust me, I've been swatting
them away like flies.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.409
- Hey, you think when this is all...
- Excuse me.

12:38.354 --> 12:40.497
Where is my soon-to-be body beautiful?

12:40.622 --> 12:42.017
Dr. Sloan.

12:43.173 --> 12:45.091
I never should have doubted you.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.680
- Water under the bridge, my friend.
- All right, everyone.

12:47.704 --> 12:50.549
We're going live in 3, 2...

12:51.309 --> 12:54.488
Let's check in with another
update from Professor Jim Scott.

12:54.780 --> 12:57.907
It's staring to get darker
out here. The shadows are...

12:59.700 --> 13:01.400
- Jim?
- You okay, Jim?

13:01.736 --> 13:02.904
Buddy?

13:03.514 --> 13:05.972
Guess my own belly doesn't
know what time it is.

13:06.030 --> 13:08.557
Still fighting off last night's lasagna.

13:09.248 --> 13:11.149
Well, keep us updated.

13:11.150 --> 13:13.548
- I hope he's okay.
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

13:13.623 --> 13:16.577
Well, let's saunter
on over to Dr. Sloan,

13:16.594 --> 13:19.070
and witness another miracle of science.

13:19.460 --> 13:21.101
Hey there, Dr. Sloan.

13:21.337 --> 13:23.710
Are you ready to kiss
those pounds goodbye?

13:24.406 --> 13:25.764
Shall we?

13:28.039 --> 13:31.081
- This is Henry Quill.
- Hi, Henry.

13:31.206 --> 13:32.780
Hi, America.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.444
And this, is our little wonder worm.

13:36.478 --> 13:39.540
Wow, that is one big boy.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.389
A swamp dweller, you say?

13:41.400 --> 13:42.655
That's right.

13:42.730 --> 13:46.346
Our ecosystem would collapse
if nature hadn't provided us

13:46.352 --> 13:48.815
with an abundance of animals
that play a significant role

13:48.832 --> 13:52.074
in mankind existence.
Ants, termites, bats.

13:52.097 --> 13:55.586
Without bees pollinating the
world's food supply, we'd be goners.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.430
And this, is another one
of nature's miracles.

13:58.434 --> 14:00.162
Is it always that active?

14:01.837 --> 14:03.991
Probably wants its breakfast.

14:04.486 --> 14:05.845
Ready Henry?

14:05.970 --> 14:07.267
Ah!

14:07.590 --> 14:08.741
Kelly?

14:09.588 --> 14:12.086
Let's uh, let's check on Jim.

14:13.540 --> 14:15.616
The eclipse seems to have...

14:16.296 --> 14:17.811
- Jimbo?
- Jim?

14:17.936 --> 14:19.835
- Kelly?
- Henry?

14:19.960 --> 14:21.459
Is there something in my eye?

14:22.731 --> 14:25.373
The eclipse seems to have reached its...

14:25.770 --> 14:27.880
We are about at totality.

14:29.754 --> 14:32.834
- Oh, it does not look good.
- It does not.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.240
- Jim?
- You okay, Jim? Buddy?

14:36.927 --> 14:38.948
Ahh!!

14:45.691 --> 14:49.412
Ah, please help me! Please make it stop!

15:07.667 --> 15:09.470
This can't be, I just...

15:13.476 --> 15:15.077
You said it was safe.

15:26.682 --> 15:28.340
But it was safe.

15:32.795 --> 15:34.666
Stop. Stop!

15:44.454 --> 15:46.153
Oh my God, no!

15:46.930 --> 15:49.382
I promise. This is safe.

15:49.460 --> 15:50.931
This is not normal.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.103
Sloan. Sloan!

15:58.151 --> 15:59.989
You son of a bitch.

15:59.990 --> 16:01.917
You knew this was gonna happen.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.700
- You knew!
- No.

16:03.725 --> 16:05.589
You were gonna make millions?

16:05.590 --> 16:07.363
And let people die like that?

16:07.420 --> 16:10.260
- I... I didn't know.
- You greedy bastard.

16:10.322 --> 16:12.170
You didn't care how
many people you killed,

16:12.204 --> 16:14.196
as long as you made a profit!

16:14.432 --> 16:17.140
This... it wasn't like that. I mean...

16:17.160 --> 16:20.130
Oh my God, solar eclipse
messes with the magnetic waves.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.740
They affect birds and insects, but,

16:21.780 --> 16:23.340
who would have guessed leeches acted...

16:23.364 --> 16:26.467
- I never did see... they reproduce...
- What are you talking about?

16:27.039 --> 16:29.572
We... we're the same, Henry.

16:29.590 --> 16:31.921
Unhappy, desperate,

16:31.938 --> 16:33.952
looking in the mirror
and hating ourselves.

16:33.977 --> 16:35.600
See, that's the wrong attitude.

16:35.611 --> 16:39.204
I was close to 300 pounds.

16:39.796 --> 16:41.506
I was looking for an easy cure,

16:41.535 --> 16:43.412
a fast miracle... but then...

16:43.809 --> 16:45.796
then my team discovered the leech.

16:45.840 --> 16:47.610
You said you tested it,

16:47.735 --> 16:50.989
- over and over and over.
- We did!

16:51.052 --> 16:53.453
In every situation imaginable. I just...

16:53.764 --> 16:58.204
We didn't count on the solar
eclipse. Who would? Oh God!

16:58.538 --> 17:02.136
I'm such a fool. I just thought
they would suck it all out of us.

17:02.140 --> 17:04.630
I didn't think it would
leave anything behind.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.905
Oh!

17:09.050 --> 17:10.829
No, no, no, no.

17:11.589 --> 17:13.554
Oh! No!

18:12.163 --> 18:13.396
Damn it!

18:14.196 --> 18:16.340
My glasses, glasses.

18:36.009 --> 18:37.489
I changed my mind!

18:37.869 --> 18:39.769
Let me go! Don't wanna see that.

18:44.115 --> 18:46.176
No! No!

18:48.283 --> 18:54.201
No! No, no, no, no, no...

19:38.280 --> 19:41.034
Suck... that!

20:52.505 --> 20:59.005
_

20:59.846 --> 21:03.746
_

21:03.747 --> 21:06.700
Hey there, Lakers. This is Jolene Payne,

21:06.710 --> 21:10.494
coming to you live on this
foggy Columbus Day weekend.

21:10.569 --> 21:13.707
I hate to be the bearer of
bad news, boys and girls,

21:13.760 --> 21:17.818
but Parks and Rec just faxed over
a water travel ban announcement.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.510
Effective immediately.

21:19.519 --> 21:23.767
But we won't let a little fog ruin
our holiday weekend, will we?

21:23.892 --> 21:25.414
So, stick around,

21:25.480 --> 21:28.080
and celebrate with me, Jolene Payne,

21:28.220 --> 21:30.775
on WNGY, the Champ,

21:30.824 --> 21:33.023
Lake Champlain Radio.

21:38.938 --> 21:41.052
How are those dishes
coming along there, Joseph?

21:41.080 --> 21:42.420
Good, Mama.

21:56.841 --> 21:57.946
Did you know?

21:58.977 --> 22:03.344
April 8th, 1977, there are 6
sightings at Champlain Lake?

22:03.361 --> 22:05.019
Rose, please.

22:05.020 --> 22:06.231
The temperature of the water

22:06.249 --> 22:08.290
was 20 degrees colder
than normal that day.

22:09.420 --> 22:10.842
Same as today.

22:11.380 --> 22:13.577
I thought we had an understanding.

22:13.630 --> 22:16.645
We agreed never to bring this up again.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.592
Champy doesn't exist. It's not real.

22:23.642 --> 22:27.603
But, Mom, didn't Daddy use
to joke that the foghorn was

22:27.626 --> 22:30.201
Champy yawning before taking a nap?

22:30.500 --> 22:31.804
Okay, hurry up.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.608
You know how Chet gets when
he's in one of his moods.

22:50.042 --> 22:51.880
- What are you doing?
- Thomas is coming.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.718
I can't let him see me like this.

22:56.726 --> 22:59.033
Oh, hi, Ms. Philips.

23:00.309 --> 23:02.202
Is... is Rose home?

23:05.791 --> 23:08.447
Thomas, this might not be a great time.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.560
You better go now, honey.

23:12.262 --> 23:13.860
I'll tell Rose you were here.

23:18.010 --> 23:20.400
_

23:22.915 --> 23:24.416
Well, well, well.

23:27.060 --> 23:29.003
What do we have here?

23:30.039 --> 23:31.840
Something I can help you with, stud?

23:32.200 --> 23:33.737
Nah, I was, I was just...

23:34.100 --> 23:35.773
seeing if Rose was...

23:35.828 --> 23:37.245
That's a nice knife.

23:38.365 --> 23:39.761
A Rambo?

23:41.042 --> 23:43.020
Got the fishhooks and wire saw...

23:43.820 --> 23:45.588
matches and shit in the handle?

23:45.860 --> 23:46.864
Uh...

23:47.518 --> 23:50.369
No, not the matches,
I used them already.

23:52.446 --> 23:54.551
You know, it's one
thing to have a knife,

23:56.434 --> 23:59.921
it's a whole nother thing
to know how to use it.

24:09.574 --> 24:11.315
Yeah, I learned this in 'Nam...

24:11.780 --> 24:13.107
Kill.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.142
Kill.

24:17.420 --> 24:19.863
Cut those arteries, it's over fast.

24:23.736 --> 24:25.058
Right here...

24:26.000 --> 24:27.936
that's how you make a man suffer.

24:29.585 --> 24:31.571
Just twist it right in there.

24:32.975 --> 24:34.150
Oh, yeah.

24:34.776 --> 24:36.826
He'll bleed out real slow.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.220
I saw it myself.

24:39.690 --> 24:41.391
I killed a VC once.

24:47.949 --> 24:49.119
That's right.

24:50.467 --> 24:53.078
There's only one rooster
at this henhouse.

24:56.892 --> 24:58.246
Get your ass gone.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.100
And Rambo?

25:05.914 --> 25:07.508
Stay away from Rose.

25:13.421 --> 25:15.713
- Meatloaf's on the table.
- Beer.

25:42.393 --> 25:43.441
It's cold.

25:44.933 --> 25:48.557
Is there anything more
disgusting than cold meatloaf?

25:48.860 --> 25:51.130
Why don't you just
pour me a can of Alpo?

25:51.140 --> 25:53.409
I'm sorry, I thought
you'd be in earlier.

25:53.410 --> 25:56.320
Yeah, well, I was out there all day

25:56.340 --> 25:59.760
trying to find work to
support this family.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.555
- You were out at O'Reilly's drinking.
- Rose.

26:02.619 --> 26:04.020
That's what you were doing.

26:20.387 --> 26:21.557
Give it back!

26:23.141 --> 26:25.085
Oh, Rose.

26:25.965 --> 26:28.540
You know how much this
upsets your mother.

26:30.678 --> 26:33.777
You know this is the nonsense
that killed your dad, right?

26:34.930 --> 26:36.210
Trash.

26:36.900 --> 26:39.576
Right where it belongs. Sit down.

26:45.711 --> 26:47.340
You didn't have to do that.

26:53.134 --> 26:54.235
You know what?

26:56.820 --> 26:58.131
Fuck this.

26:58.780 --> 27:00.577
I was just trying to help.

27:01.857 --> 27:03.133
Shit.

27:04.229 --> 27:06.615
I'll go work on my fucking truck.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.040
Why do you put up with him, Mom?

27:21.068 --> 27:22.768
After your father died...

27:23.252 --> 27:25.980
- he made sure we were okay.
- No, Mom.

27:26.173 --> 27:28.354
He just took advantage of you.

27:28.740 --> 27:30.226
Can't you see that?

27:30.456 --> 27:33.485
He only started coming round
when Daddy's insurance paid up.

27:33.680 --> 27:35.759
I'm surprised he's still here,

27:36.202 --> 27:37.987
now that the money's gone.

27:39.890 --> 27:42.711
Joseph, please go outside and play.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.280
Your dad...

27:58.401 --> 28:02.579
Your dad came home one day spouting
off about that thing in the lake.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.206
He spent his life chasing it.

28:06.230 --> 28:08.707
Everyone in town thought he was crazy.

28:11.360 --> 28:14.791
He spent all his time and our money.

28:14.814 --> 28:15.960
For what?

28:17.440 --> 28:19.280
He forgot about us, Rose.

28:19.780 --> 28:21.420
He forgot about you.

28:21.980 --> 28:23.722
And where did it get him?

28:29.820 --> 28:31.459
At the bottom of the lake.

28:36.939 --> 28:37.994
You know...

28:38.395 --> 28:41.724
Dad didn't care if the whole
town believed him or not.

28:43.020 --> 28:45.064
He went out there every night

28:45.077 --> 28:47.275
because he just wanted you to believe.

29:00.620 --> 29:01.800
Rose!

29:08.087 --> 29:09.160
Rose.

29:09.590 --> 29:11.030
Rose, everything okay?

29:19.495 --> 29:20.532
Rose!

29:21.300 --> 29:22.590
Rose, wait up!

29:23.166 --> 29:24.860
Just leave me alone.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.097
Rose!

29:31.115 --> 29:32.320
Rose!

29:41.906 --> 29:42.910
Rose.

29:44.020 --> 29:45.480
Rose, you're bleeding.

29:45.840 --> 29:46.867
Uh?

29:48.040 --> 29:49.939
Where the hell did that come from?

29:50.480 --> 29:53.094
Whoa, that's weird.

29:54.387 --> 29:57.050
- I... I don't know.
- Rose!

29:59.361 --> 30:00.660
What is that?

30:07.980 --> 30:09.060
Weird.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.700
- Rose?
- What?

30:17.711 --> 30:18.980
What's the matter?

30:20.345 --> 30:21.560
Oh my God.

30:21.860 --> 30:23.020
Rose, what?

30:25.536 --> 30:26.860
What is that?

30:28.819 --> 30:29.900
It...

30:34.825 --> 30:36.281
It looks like some sort of

30:37.013 --> 30:38.570
messed up whale.

30:41.803 --> 30:43.460
That's no whale.

30:44.995 --> 30:46.400
He was right.

30:47.708 --> 30:49.080
Who was right?

30:49.230 --> 30:51.674
My dad. He was right, all along.

30:52.687 --> 30:55.129
Look, it's her.

30:55.470 --> 30:56.580
You see?

30:58.376 --> 31:00.086
It's really Champ.

31:02.840 --> 31:04.580
No, no, Rose.

31:05.380 --> 31:06.820
Champy was just...

31:07.832 --> 31:09.480
made up to sell T-shirts.

31:09.530 --> 31:11.231
It's smaller than my dad thought,

31:12.020 --> 31:13.838
but it's definitely Champ.

31:16.168 --> 31:17.688
Is it sleeping?

31:18.871 --> 31:19.980
No.

31:21.179 --> 31:23.120
I think she's dead, Joey.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.740
I think she's some sort of dinosaur.

31:31.721 --> 31:33.517
A real dinosaur?

31:40.240 --> 31:42.336
I think this is what
killed the poor thing.

31:43.146 --> 31:44.758
Come here. It's okay.

31:47.826 --> 31:49.009
Look.

31:49.396 --> 31:53.159
This is Champy. This is
what Dad was looking for.

31:53.160 --> 31:56.277
- All of those years.
- Holy shit.

31:57.258 --> 32:00.477
Rose, you know what
this means, right? I...

32:01.621 --> 32:03.204
You're gonna be famous.

32:05.378 --> 32:08.200
No. My dad found her first.

32:08.440 --> 32:10.200
I want everyone to know that.

32:10.527 --> 32:11.895
We just came along.

32:12.020 --> 32:13.954
I want him to get the credit for this.

32:22.591 --> 32:24.215
Go and get Mom, okay?

32:24.340 --> 32:27.641
Follow the edge of the water until
you get to the path, and hurry.

32:36.020 --> 32:39.755
People have been looking
for Champy for decades.

32:39.921 --> 32:41.934
They never found a single thing.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.055
I need to document this.

32:45.180 --> 32:46.374
Dad would have.

32:47.060 --> 32:48.271
Smile.

33:00.108 --> 33:03.318
Mama, Mama, we found Champy!

33:04.157 --> 33:05.700
Come quickly!

33:08.730 --> 33:10.220
Rambo.

33:14.822 --> 33:17.415
One morning, my dad goes fishing,

33:18.280 --> 33:20.325
ignores all the fog warnings.

33:20.642 --> 33:22.160
Doesn't come home.

33:23.061 --> 33:25.373
Mom calls the cops.

33:26.420 --> 33:28.131
They can't turn up anything.

33:30.015 --> 33:33.409
Next morning, when the
mist finally breaks,

33:35.261 --> 33:36.610
I find him.

33:38.393 --> 33:42.120
Washed up on the beach, unconscious.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.820
When he finally comes to, he...

33:47.040 --> 33:48.660
looks at us like...

33:50.500 --> 33:52.017
like we're strangers.

33:52.086 --> 33:54.651
Doesn't say anything for days.

33:56.438 --> 33:58.557
Then one night at dinner,

33:59.580 --> 34:01.283
he says his first word.

34:02.697 --> 34:03.880
What was that?

34:05.291 --> 34:06.364
Champ.

34:06.857 --> 34:08.900
He says Champy is real.

34:11.199 --> 34:12.440
He tells Mom.

34:13.760 --> 34:14.900
They argue.

34:15.290 --> 34:17.560
She begs him not to say things that

34:17.739 --> 34:20.038
people will begin to think he's crazy.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.331
He loses everything.

34:25.920 --> 34:29.228
He goes out, night after night, looking

34:29.661 --> 34:30.980
and searching.

34:32.217 --> 34:33.719
Until one morning...

34:34.598 --> 34:37.214
he's washed up on the beach again.

34:40.193 --> 34:41.639
Only this time...

34:46.826 --> 34:48.040
I'm sorry.

34:52.639 --> 34:53.679
Stay here.

34:55.527 --> 34:56.958
I got a really dumb idea.

35:07.630 --> 35:08.880
Can I look now?

35:10.592 --> 35:11.740
Not yet.

35:14.350 --> 35:15.566
Better hurry.

35:23.802 --> 35:25.009
Thomas.

35:26.140 --> 35:27.560
- What?
- It's for your father.

35:27.828 --> 35:29.480
Now, nobody can take credit for this.

35:30.050 --> 35:31.429
It's great.

35:31.448 --> 35:33.641
_

35:34.440 --> 35:35.520
It's great.

35:36.190 --> 35:38.104
Take a picture. We'll...

35:39.040 --> 35:41.571
get your dad's name in the
National Geographic or something.

35:43.428 --> 35:44.760
Say cheese, Champ.

36:08.741 --> 36:09.860
Chet?

36:10.689 --> 36:12.300
What the fuck?

36:15.796 --> 36:17.400
What are you doing down here?

36:17.579 --> 36:19.377
Holy shit.

36:19.430 --> 36:21.558
- Stay away from it.
- Would you look at this.

36:21.560 --> 36:22.654
Get away.

36:26.569 --> 36:29.240
Guess you daddy wasn't
out of his mind after all.

36:31.830 --> 36:33.275
Bless his heart.

36:37.121 --> 36:40.064
All those years, all that money spent,

36:40.560 --> 36:43.564
looking for this disgusting thing.

36:45.040 --> 36:47.240
It's too bad he didn't pack his snorkel.

36:50.022 --> 36:52.933
But I bet he's looking down
right now from heaven.

36:53.440 --> 36:56.615
Glad as all hell Chet's
gonna finish the job.

36:56.740 --> 36:58.240
What are you talking about?

36:58.250 --> 37:01.199
We found it, not you. My dad's
gonna get the credit for this.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.834
Girl, your daddy's dead.

37:04.381 --> 37:06.260
I don't see how that's
actually gonna happen.

37:06.500 --> 37:08.771
Far as I'm concern, this is my ticket.

37:09.374 --> 37:10.866
I've put up with enough shit

37:10.907 --> 37:14.307
from your dumb-ass mom and
you idiot kids. This thing...

37:15.120 --> 37:17.115
is gonna make me rich.

37:17.459 --> 37:20.489
Oh, people will pay through
the teeth to see it,

37:20.935 --> 37:24.209
to see what I discovered.

37:29.167 --> 37:31.534
- Oh, ain't that sweet.
- Give it back.

37:33.025 --> 37:34.708
- But it's gotta go.
- No.

37:34.760 --> 37:36.407
No, s... stop.

37:36.424 --> 37:39.343
Oh really, boy? Well, huh?

37:40.027 --> 37:41.127
Huh?

37:41.170 --> 37:43.521
- You watch your step, boy.
- No, stop.

37:44.748 --> 37:46.960
Rose found that, not you.

37:47.557 --> 37:50.684
You better shut you piehole
before I skin you too.

37:51.691 --> 37:52.699
Come on.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.002
I'll cut your head square off that neck.

37:55.027 --> 37:56.112
Chet, stop.

37:56.113 --> 37:58.730
- Leave him alone.
- Oh, you want a fight?

37:59.416 --> 38:00.440
Is that it?

38:02.123 --> 38:03.880
Why don't we make it interesting?

38:06.802 --> 38:07.920
Thomas!

38:08.819 --> 38:09.819
Come on.

38:11.030 --> 38:12.471
Pick it up, Rambo.

38:13.931 --> 38:15.260
Don't do it, Thomas.

38:15.580 --> 38:16.985
Don't play his game.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.780
Thomas, please don't.

38:25.855 --> 38:27.283
Watch out!

38:44.006 --> 38:45.848
Now, I'm gonna lay out some hurt.

38:45.872 --> 38:47.872
- No!
- Uhhh!

38:48.455 --> 38:49.920
There's a dinosaur.

38:49.934 --> 38:51.235
- What?
- Daddy was right.

38:51.251 --> 38:54.194
- What are you taking about?
- I saw it, Mama.

38:55.599 --> 38:58.210
- Where are Thomas and Rose?
- Over there.

39:00.301 --> 39:02.014
- Chet...
- Argh!

39:03.483 --> 39:06.146
Rose... Come on, come on.

39:10.259 --> 39:11.360
You bit me.

39:11.820 --> 39:14.073
You fucking bit me, you little bitch.

39:19.209 --> 39:21.327
You two little shits are in for it now.

39:21.340 --> 39:23.180
- Run, Rose. Go!
- I'm not leaving you.

39:23.261 --> 39:24.485
Oh, yeah?

39:24.527 --> 39:28.410
I'm gonna carve you up so small,
fish are gonna have a feast.

39:49.807 --> 39:52.122
- Rose, come on.
- Wait.

40:39.938 --> 40:43.291
- No, no, wait.
- Rose, don't.

40:53.730 --> 40:56.000
But no one will ever believe us now.

41:01.557 --> 41:04.279
Rose! Thomas!

41:07.498 --> 41:08.780
What happened?

41:08.852 --> 41:12.026
Joey was making any sense,
then I heard Chet scream.

41:12.050 --> 41:13.357
Champ was here.

41:13.740 --> 41:14.941
Dad was right.

41:15.139 --> 41:17.221
It was her, and we all saw her.

41:18.216 --> 41:19.910
Champ, the lake monster?

41:20.122 --> 41:21.122
Yeah.

41:21.656 --> 41:24.300
Dad was right. She does exist.

41:25.612 --> 41:28.739
- She was right here, Mama.
- Ms. Philips, she... she was here.

41:28.740 --> 41:30.915
Chet was coming after me
and Thomas with a knife,

41:31.040 --> 41:33.133
and... and she saved us.

41:34.994 --> 41:37.626
- There's nothing here, Rose.
- She was here, Mama.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.364
- We saw her.
- Dad was right.

41:39.380 --> 41:42.275
- Ms. Philips, she was here.
- Where'd Champ go, Rose?

41:42.400 --> 41:44.034
Don't you believe us?

41:56.776 --> 41:57.880
Mom?

42:02.147 --> 42:05.629
Maybe your dad wasn't as crazy
as everyone thought he was, huh?

42:13.076 --> 42:14.100
Come on.

42:16.553 --> 42:18.000
Let's go home.

42:49.344 --> 42:53.344
