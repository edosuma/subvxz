WEBVTT

00:00.901 --> 00:02.436
Previously on "The Path"...

00:02.469 --> 00:05.273
I relinquish my guilt
for being with Cal.

00:05.306 --> 00:09.043
Everything else I've done
that is horrible this year...

00:09.077 --> 00:10.044
Uhh!

00:10.078 --> 00:11.612
She chose me!

00:11.645 --> 00:13.681
Just... like...

00:13.714 --> 00:15.083
Steve.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.318
- You're a Denier, Eddie.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.489
Deniers need to stay
where they belong.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.325
- Felicia... were you...

00:24.358 --> 00:26.394
- Richard told me everything.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.362
But I need to hear it from you.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.131
I just need the files

00:30.164 --> 00:33.067
for every disgruntled Meyerist
who has ever left.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.403
- The blackmail victims
that I have lined up for Penetti

00:35.436 --> 00:38.272
are pieces of shit,
but they sent me back in there

00:38.306 --> 00:41.075
because The Movement was
causing trouble for DeKann,

00:41.109 --> 00:43.177
Penetti's biggest
campaign donor.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.179
Eddie, my name isn't Sam.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.615
- Mary, get in the car.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.785
How did you find out
about me and Cal?

00:51.819 --> 00:53.687
- Why don't you tell me

00:53.721 --> 00:56.690
the rest of the horrible things
you've done this past year.

01:42.570 --> 01:46.307
This way... it's okay.

02:01.489 --> 02:04.325
No.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.327
No...

02:06.360 --> 02:08.196
It's the same fucking tree.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.731
Fuck... shit!

02:17.705 --> 02:20.374
Help!

02:23.444 --> 02:25.913
Help me!

02:29.450 --> 02:31.619
Cal!

02:31.652 --> 02:33.621
Help!

02:36.657 --> 02:40.394
*

02:40.428 --> 02:42.363
Help!

02:42.396 --> 02:47.501
*

02:47.535 --> 02:49.670
Help!

03:06.754 --> 03:13.694
*

03:30.644 --> 03:32.446
I'm lost, man.

03:32.480 --> 03:36.917
I'm in someone else's story,
a pawn.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.686
I don't know, I just...

03:38.719 --> 03:41.689
God, I just wanna
get the reins back.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.360
- So Sarah blackmailed...

03:46.394 --> 03:48.562
the people
who came to her for help.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.797
- Yeah.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.732
And if I bring them in
to testify,

03:51.765 --> 03:56.236
she's looking at four years,
minimum sentence.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.281
- Why are you telling me
all this?

04:11.319 --> 04:13.454
- Because if you want me
to handle this

04:13.487 --> 04:17.891
in a certain way, Eddie...

04:17.925 --> 04:20.394
I will.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.266
- Oh, my God.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.606
You know what? No.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.509
No. This is not on you...

04:35.543 --> 04:37.345
to carry.

04:37.378 --> 04:41.582
Okay? Sarah made her own
choices.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.917
And you need to as well.

04:43.951 --> 04:47.321
You need to decide
what to do next, not for...

04:47.355 --> 04:52.460
not for me, not for Sarah,
but for you.

04:56.730 --> 05:00.334
Listen, man, um...

05:00.368 --> 05:02.570
- I need to get some rest.
- Yeah.

05:02.603 --> 05:06.574
- As do you, so...
- Mm-hmm.

05:06.607 --> 05:11.078
- Hey, sleep the sleep
of the just.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.518
Be careful, Eddie.

05:23.491 --> 05:27.428
Trust starts with truth
and it ends with truth.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.730
Why did you steal my Transgress?

05:29.763 --> 05:32.633
And why did you show it
to Eddie? Why me?

05:32.666 --> 05:36.570
- Did you steal others?
- Only yours.

05:36.604 --> 05:39.440
- Why, Richard?

05:39.473 --> 05:41.842
What are you and Felicia
plotting?

05:44.945 --> 05:47.915
- To see the rightful Guardian
put in place.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.983
- The rightful Guardian
being Eddie Lane?

05:50.017 --> 05:52.820
- This is insane.
- No!

05:52.853 --> 05:54.822
I'm the rightful Guardian.

05:54.855 --> 05:59.126
Eddie was simply a means
to an end, that's all.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.795
I tried to motivate him
to help me to use his anger

06:01.829 --> 06:04.031
by confirming his worst fear.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.634
- Eddie was just a pawn.
- Wow.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.738
I really, uh...

06:10.771 --> 06:13.441
I really thought
we were friends.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.443
- You never much cared
for my friendship

06:15.476 --> 06:17.511
when Steve was ill.

06:17.545 --> 06:20.180
- All you wanted was power.
- No, Richard said

06:20.213 --> 06:23.551
the plan was for him
to take our place.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.687
That Eddie was... just a pawn.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.757
- Richard lied.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.725
- Felicia told us
that you believe

06:31.759 --> 06:33.727
that Steve chose Eddie
to lead The Movement.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.569
Fine.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.504
Yes.

06:43.537 --> 06:46.474
That is what I believe
The Light intends.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.109
- You're a fucking liar.
- Who else is involved

06:49.142 --> 06:50.711
- in this?
- Only me and Richard.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.580
- Hank Armstrong?
- Doesn't it bother you

06:52.613 --> 06:54.682
that he would ask me
about your father?

06:54.715 --> 06:56.950
- Answer the question.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.753
- No. Hank was not privy
to any of this.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.490
- I thought Bill
was involved, though, right?

07:02.523 --> 07:04.792
- Bill had nothing
to do with this.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.562
I did what I did to you

07:08.596 --> 07:10.598
because I felt I had to,

07:10.631 --> 07:13.066
but I'll go to my grave
burdened.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.473
Good.

07:27.548 --> 07:30.150
- Please, no.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.686
- You think you're not a Denier?

07:32.720 --> 07:34.822
- Sarah, should...
- No! He abused his position

07:34.855 --> 07:36.690
and betrayed my trust.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.726
My trust.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.762
And you destabilized
our community.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.766
You have been selfish
and petty and deceitful.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.770
You have to go.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.818
- What have you done, Felicia?

08:04.852 --> 08:06.687
- I'm so sorry, love.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.789
- You said you were in Peru.
- I took no joy

08:08.822 --> 08:12.726
in deceiving you... I wanted
to be sure before I told you.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.596
Before I risked...

08:15.629 --> 08:18.198
I know how comfortable you are
with our life,

08:18.231 --> 08:20.668
with what we have.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.272
All I know is that
when Richard called,

08:25.305 --> 08:27.307
I knew what he was saying
was true.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.910
- Oh, please...

08:32.111 --> 08:36.249
None of us knows what's true.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.918
- Yes.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.053
Yes, we do.

08:44.256 --> 08:46.760
- Your hands...

08:52.365 --> 08:55.135
We had taken the medicine.

08:55.168 --> 08:59.206
There was a campfire.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.575
When I woke up,

09:01.609 --> 09:04.244
you and Silas and Steve

09:04.277 --> 09:05.979
told me the story.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.248
But I didn't see any of it.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.817
- "The story"?

09:09.850 --> 09:12.820
- Tell them that you acted
out of spite,

09:12.853 --> 09:15.656
that you'll support
their leadership.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.191
It's over.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.864
I want you home with me.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.704
I, uh...

09:32.940 --> 09:35.776
I, uh, want to apologize
and, uh,

09:35.809 --> 09:39.913
to be clear... she knows
how badly she's fucked up.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.916
- Bill...
- She does.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.853
I... want her
to go home with me.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.289
We support you.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.025
She supports you.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.061
- We want this
to be over, Felicia.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.196
I know we've had our
differences,

09:56.229 --> 09:58.065
but we'd like you
to stand with us.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.334
- Richard is gone.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.671
- You made a mistake.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.374
We all do.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.009
Own it...

10:09.042 --> 10:10.277
atone.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.013
Go back to San Diego.

10:15.683 --> 10:18.686
- I won't do
any of those things.

10:18.719 --> 10:23.223
I have nothing to atone for,
especially not to you.

10:23.256 --> 10:27.094
Only The Light can judge me.

10:30.130 --> 10:37.004
*

11:04.131 --> 11:05.933
- They know.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.335
- Cal, Sarah... they know.
- Know? Know what?

11:08.368 --> 11:10.237
- Richard, Felicia.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.705
- Fuck!

11:11.739 --> 11:13.240
- Well, are they safe?
- I don't know.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.942
All I know is that it's over.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.910
This is the last time
that we can talk.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.122
- They don't... they don't know
you were helping us, right?

11:19.146 --> 11:21.782
- Not yet. Maybe they do.
- They haven't come after me yet.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.051
Listen, just lay low.
Disappear.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.386
Or, plea... Just don't
fan the flames.

11:37.798 --> 11:44.738
*

11:59.853 --> 12:03.791
This is as far
as we'll take Deniers, Richard.

12:05.826 --> 12:09.096
Come on!
What're ya doin'?

12:09.129 --> 12:11.765
- I'm sorry, Sarah,
for what I did.

12:11.799 --> 12:14.434
I'll pray for your forgiveness.

12:23.977 --> 12:30.918
*

12:36.123 --> 12:39.092
Felicia will stand
with us again,

12:39.126 --> 12:41.328
eventually.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.296
And Richard would have, too.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.032
- It doesn't matter.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.136
What he did was unforgiveable.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.470
- Yeah.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.140
But the community will miss him.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.275
What will we tell them?

12:55.308 --> 12:57.945
- The truth.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.383
Do you think it's true?

13:03.416 --> 13:05.018
That Steve chose Eddie?

13:08.555 --> 13:11.224
- It doesn't matter.

13:11.258 --> 13:16.029
Steve was... as mortal
as the rest of us.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.799
More, even.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.471
Steve's words...

13:24.504 --> 13:27.207
mean nothing.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.413
*

13:43.390 --> 13:46.459
- Apps and well drinks
are half-off until 7:00.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.897
The pils on draft's $2.00,
shots, 3.00.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.167
- I'll take a pilsner.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.405
- Get the fuck outta here.

13:58.438 --> 14:02.109
- I'm not with them
anymore either.

14:02.142 --> 14:06.880
But I have been talking
to a lot of people... like us

14:06.914 --> 14:10.517
who may have wanted to stay but
were told that they had to go.

14:10.550 --> 14:14.054
This says here that you were...

14:14.087 --> 14:17.157
"kicked out for being
brazenly insubordinate."

14:17.190 --> 14:19.592
But everything written down
about you, other than this,

14:19.626 --> 14:23.130
said that you were
thoughtful, confident,

14:23.163 --> 14:25.098
- principled.
- The principles certainly mean

14:25.132 --> 14:27.500
a lot less once you
piss off the Golden Boy.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.669
I dared to ask Steve
if there was a better way

14:29.702 --> 14:31.104
to deal with the Novices.

14:31.138 --> 14:34.207
I was one, Cal wasn't.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.485
Steve thought that showed
leadership qualities on my part.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.411
He told me I should
shoot up The Ladder.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.313
- So what happened?

14:40.347 --> 14:42.682
- Cal didn't like that, I guess.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.119
He cried to Daddy, told him
I was always starting shit.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.321
Week later, I'm out.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.323
Back on a friend's couch.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.692
- Fuck it.
- Fuck him.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.561
- Better put. Yeah.

14:54.594 --> 14:55.963
Fuck Cal.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.998
- Steve's dead.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.667
- Did you know that?
- No.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.604
Shit.

15:07.074 --> 15:10.210
I had this feeling
when I was climbing.

15:10.243 --> 15:14.481
It's like I was...

15:14.514 --> 15:16.083
full.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.220
Only way I know
how to describe it.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.622
'Stead of half empty...

15:25.558 --> 15:28.962
- Well, Cal is in charge now,

15:28.996 --> 15:32.432
and he shouldn't be.

15:32.465 --> 15:36.169
I wanna do somethin' about that.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.105
- Cheers to that.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.710
Our losing Steve continues
to be felt, doesn't it?

15:43.743 --> 15:45.645
There have been growing pains.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.380
We've all felt them.

15:47.414 --> 15:50.050
And that's why
we're so thankful to Bill

15:50.083 --> 15:52.619
for coming out
to show his support.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.287
- We...

15:54.321 --> 15:57.324
can't let Richard's misstep,

15:57.357 --> 16:00.260
his, uh, inexplicable
lapse in judgment,

16:00.293 --> 16:03.130
his betrayal...

16:03.163 --> 16:07.367
take away from all the progress

16:07.400 --> 16:10.337
that, uh, you are...

16:10.370 --> 16:13.073
- you all are making here.
- Mm-hmm.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.450
- Does Mary
and Sean's disappearance

16:14.474 --> 16:16.009
have anything to do
with Richard?

16:16.043 --> 16:18.011
- Uh, we don't think so, um...

16:18.045 --> 16:20.147
it seems Sean's parents

16:20.180 --> 16:22.015
coerced them into leaving.

16:22.049 --> 16:24.751
- But why?
- Why would Richard do this?

16:24.784 --> 16:28.455
- I've asked myself the same
thing over and over,

16:28.488 --> 16:31.691
but asking only makes it
more painful.

16:31.724 --> 16:36.596
Who knows why people do
the awful things that they do?

16:36.629 --> 16:38.465
All we can do is pray for him.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.171
- And, as Bill said,

16:44.204 --> 16:47.107
don't forget the amazing work
we're doing here

16:47.140 --> 16:48.775
and at the city center,

16:48.808 --> 16:51.378
the work we tried to do
in Clarksville.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.813
It's always an uphill battle
when you take on "big business,"

16:53.846 --> 16:57.484
but we took on a fight no one
else was brave enough to.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.053
And Hawk even got thrown
in handcuffs.

17:00.087 --> 17:03.256
I tell you, honestly, I...

17:03.290 --> 17:08.095
I couldn't be more proud
of... of who we are,

17:08.127 --> 17:10.196
all of us, where we are.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.763
We are out there... You.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.666
You are out there
serving The Light,

17:14.701 --> 17:17.204
building The Garden,

17:17.237 --> 17:18.305
right now, today!

17:18.338 --> 17:20.039
Yeah!

17:30.783 --> 17:37.557
*

17:47.500 --> 17:50.703
- The Movement was everything
to Richard, and vice versa.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.805
He was Meyerism's
favorite uncle,

17:52.839 --> 17:55.175
and hearing him described
as this monster is...

17:55.208 --> 17:57.244
- Shh. You're gonna find
yourself in a program.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.279
- Hi.
- Hey, Bill.

17:59.312 --> 18:02.682
Oh, it's too bad Felicia
couldn't make it.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.751
- Well, she's been
under the weather.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.320
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- What is going on?

18:07.354 --> 18:10.357
- It's crazy, scary, I...
- Sure is.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.693
- There's nothing
to be scared of,

18:13.726 --> 18:15.362
I can assure you.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.197
We've had problems
like this before.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.700
- I think the... severity
of Richard's actions is felt.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.835
- Absolutely.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.505
- I need to get going.
- Where?

18:25.538 --> 18:28.675
- Uh, I haven't had any time
in days, you know,

18:28.708 --> 18:30.610
to take care of anything, so...

18:30.643 --> 18:32.845
I have some things
I need to catch up on.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.914
- Do you think there was
anything that I didn't...

18:34.947 --> 18:36.616
Or we didn't address?

18:36.649 --> 18:38.685
- No. We handled it.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.520
It's done.

18:47.394 --> 18:54.334
*

19:30.537 --> 19:33.306
Cal, is that you?

19:33.340 --> 19:35.308
- Yeah.
- Oh.

19:35.342 --> 19:38.378
Thought I heard someone.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.213
Anything, uh...

19:40.247 --> 19:42.682
in particular
you're looking for?

19:42.715 --> 19:45.285
- Just, uh, clothes, I guess.

19:45.318 --> 19:48.255
Seeing what they left behind.

19:48.288 --> 19:51.291
It's always sad
when you know you couldn't, uh,

19:51.324 --> 19:53.893
keep someone on the right path.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.828
- I'll pray for them.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.433
It's weird.

20:00.467 --> 20:04.271
Felicia wasn't there today.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.972
- Yeah, she's sick.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.641
- Yeah. That's what
they're sayin'.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.413
I want you to know...

20:13.446 --> 20:15.882
I got your back.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.685
I wanna help maintain
law and order

20:18.718 --> 20:20.887
any way I can.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.390
- There's not many
guys around here

20:23.423 --> 20:24.657
who possess your...

20:24.691 --> 20:27.226
integrity and loyalty.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.741
- We'll...

20:41.774 --> 20:44.344
we'll clean that out.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.846
And things didn't have to end

20:46.879 --> 20:49.516
the way they did.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.618
They didn't have to end at all.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.321
- They wanted me to say
that my kid is an IS.

20:54.354 --> 20:58.758
- Well, I want to reform
that part of the movement.

20:58.791 --> 21:02.762
And I want you to help me.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.831
- I will.

21:07.867 --> 21:14.774
*

21:23.850 --> 21:26.719
- What the fuck are you doing?

21:26.753 --> 21:28.621
Why are you following me?

21:28.655 --> 21:30.523
- I wanted to see
if it was true.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.892
- See what?
- If you...

21:32.925 --> 21:36.763
If you thought it was true that
you're the rightful Guardian.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.767
- Look, I don't know
what I am, but I do know

21:40.800 --> 21:43.536
that I want things to be better,

21:43.570 --> 21:45.037
and I think they can be better.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.039
- So, what, are you
collecting Deniers now?

21:47.073 --> 21:49.742
What are you doing with them?

21:49.776 --> 21:51.678
- Look, they don't...

21:51.711 --> 21:56.082
We don't want to be
Deniers, Sarah.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.717
- Well, you don't get to choose.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.852
- Maybe we should.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.021
- Who else is behind this?

22:04.891 --> 22:06.593
- Steve.
- Steve.

22:06.626 --> 22:10.029
Well, he's not... everything
that we thought he was.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.432
- No one is.
- That's right.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.534
And you're being vindictive
and bitter.

22:14.567 --> 22:18.771
- Oh, don't tell me
what I'm being.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.973
Blackmail?

22:21.007 --> 22:24.010
With the unburdening tapes?

22:25.845 --> 22:29.716
Wow. You know, your victims
wanna testify against you.

22:34.454 --> 22:35.855
- How do you know about this?

22:35.888 --> 22:37.790
- 'Cause I know everything,
Sarah,

22:37.824 --> 22:40.960
and one way or another...

22:40.993 --> 22:44.564
you will be punished.

22:47.600 --> 22:53.139
*

22:56.175 --> 23:03.115
*

23:26.673 --> 23:27.940
- Uhh!

23:32.211 --> 23:33.780
Ah!

23:42.121 --> 23:43.923
Ah! Aah!

23:45.725 --> 23:47.093
Aah!
Aah!

23:57.069 --> 24:00.473
*

24:02.709 --> 24:04.944
Drop-offs are in the back.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.246
All right... bring it down.

24:15.021 --> 24:22.595
*

24:26.032 --> 24:30.002
* When the morning breaks

24:30.036 --> 24:31.938
Gimme 20 minutes!

24:31.971 --> 24:36.543
* Chase away the snakes

24:36.576 --> 24:38.578
* Is it my fate

24:38.611 --> 24:42.081
*

24:42.114 --> 24:45.852
* To dream of snakes

24:50.022 --> 24:54.093
* Darkness is a boon

24:54.126 --> 24:56.162
*

24:56.195 --> 25:00.199
* Paradoxes loom

25:00.232 --> 25:03.836
* Thinking room

25:03.870 --> 25:06.205
*

25:06.238 --> 25:09.542
* Loneliness dooms

25:09.576 --> 25:14.246
*

25:14.280 --> 25:18.084
* In my bed I curse

25:18.117 --> 25:19.986
- Jeremiah!

25:20.019 --> 25:25.057
* Despair around me swirls

25:25.091 --> 25:26.759
- Richard.

25:26.793 --> 25:30.597
* I whirl

25:30.630 --> 25:36.335
* And find a girl

25:36.368 --> 25:38.838
- Huh.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.206
Triathalon?

25:40.239 --> 25:42.241
- Weird. I know.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.243
With my asthma and all.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.212
- Huh. It was because of
your asthma

25:46.245 --> 25:48.948
that Steve started you swimming.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.785
He said it would be good
for your lungs.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.887
- Then I took up the bike.

25:54.921 --> 25:57.123
Then the run.

25:57.156 --> 26:00.326
- You make it sound so easy.

26:00.359 --> 26:03.129
Swim, bike, run.
Go, dog, go.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.600
Please... sit.

26:19.946 --> 26:22.749
- It's good to see you,
Jeremiah.

26:26.686 --> 26:29.722
- Is there anything
you wanna talk about, or...

26:29.756 --> 26:34.827
- I just wanted to say hello.

26:34.861 --> 26:37.997
And maybe...

26:38.030 --> 26:40.967
ask if you had a spare couch
I could use.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.869
Just for a few days.

26:42.902 --> 26:44.336
- You left The Movement?

26:44.370 --> 26:47.874
- In a manner of speaking.

26:47.907 --> 26:51.143
The couch would be
just for a few days.

26:51.177 --> 26:54.180
- I haven't spoken
to you for 20 years.

26:54.213 --> 26:58.718
- You're the only person
I know outside.

26:58.751 --> 27:02.955
- I-I'm sorry, but no.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.692
It wouldn't be fair to Daniel.

27:08.327 --> 27:11.798
- Of course.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.733
I shouldn't have.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.104
I understand.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.884
I wish I hadn't believed
that you lost your worth

27:31.918 --> 27:34.721
when you lost your faith.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.258
- Well, you did.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.899
Good-bye, Jeremiah.

27:49.902 --> 27:54.907
*

27:57.209 --> 27:59.178
You've reached
Sarah Lane's voicemail.

27:59.211 --> 28:01.280
Please leave a message.

28:01.313 --> 28:04.283
- Hi, hi, hi, uh...

28:04.316 --> 28:06.853
I just wanted to, um...

28:06.886 --> 28:11.758
I know that there's been
some struggle and, uh...

28:11.791 --> 28:13.926
I completely understand.

28:13.960 --> 28:18.765
You didn't call last night,
so, um...

28:18.798 --> 28:20.933
I just wanted to make sure
that you're okay.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.401
Um...

28:22.434 --> 28:24.804
and, uh...

28:24.837 --> 28:29.275
and, uh, yeah,
and we're okay, um...

28:29.308 --> 28:31.377
Ha.

28:31.410 --> 28:34.146
I've been...

28:34.180 --> 28:37.016
so, um...

28:37.049 --> 28:40.386
a-and, you know,
being with you has been...

28:40.419 --> 28:45.457
It is, um, even with...

28:45.491 --> 28:50.329
all the complications, um...

28:50.362 --> 28:53.065
um...

28:53.099 --> 28:55.201
Yeah, anyway...

28:55.234 --> 28:58.204
Call me back.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.406
Uh, I love you.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.351
Hey, Hank, what's up?

29:16.522 --> 29:19.225
- Hi. Has anyone, uh, come in
named Sarah Lane?

29:19.258 --> 29:21.560
- Any word?
- Hawk's checking hospitals.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.462
Gaby's freaking out at home
with Summer.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.331
- Okay. I'm sure
there's an explanation.

29:25.364 --> 29:28.000
- She always calls
to say good night to Summer.

29:28.034 --> 29:30.136
- Well, until we know
there's something wrong,

29:30.169 --> 29:31.838
let's not jump to conclusions.

29:31.871 --> 29:34.040
Just keep calling
the police stations.

29:34.073 --> 29:35.875
Hawk... anything?

29:35.908 --> 29:38.444
- She's... gonna be okay,
right?

29:38.477 --> 29:40.046
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.447
Uh, my daughter Sarah Lane...

29:41.480 --> 29:43.115
- She's...

29:43.149 --> 29:47.286
she's dropped off before
when she's with...

29:49.856 --> 29:51.290
Just keep calling.

29:51.323 --> 29:54.460
- Sir, are you there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:54.493 --> 29:55.995
- I'm here, um...
- I'm sorry, sir.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.997
We have no one under that name.

29:58.030 --> 30:00.332
- Uh... thanks.

30:30.429 --> 30:37.303
*

30:37.336 --> 30:39.972
Uhh... ohh!

30:51.150 --> 30:52.150
Aah!

31:19.478 --> 31:26.385
*

31:59.118 --> 32:00.219
- Morning.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.154
I'm Gabriel.

32:02.188 --> 32:05.157
You had a very bad accident.

32:05.191 --> 32:07.059
Your arm is broken.

32:07.093 --> 32:10.462
It was a miracle
it wasn't worse, Mrs. Lane.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.498
- Sarah.

32:12.531 --> 32:15.301
You're okay.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.003
Thank you.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.071
Hawk's with me.

32:19.105 --> 32:23.709
He... he just went downstairs
to get some food.

32:23.742 --> 32:26.512
You don't know
how terrified we were.

32:26.545 --> 32:31.050
I-I was so relieved
when we... we got the call.

32:31.083 --> 32:34.320
- Someone ran me off the road.

32:34.353 --> 32:37.389
- What?

32:37.423 --> 32:39.391
Are you sure?

32:42.494 --> 32:44.630
- I... Eddie...

32:44.663 --> 32:47.166
- Eddie ran you off the road?

32:47.199 --> 32:50.669
- No. No, Eddie...

32:50.702 --> 32:52.704
Eddie knows I used the tapes.

32:54.706 --> 32:57.009
And he knows about the money.

32:57.043 --> 32:59.545
- Um... how does he know?

32:59.578 --> 33:02.281
- I-I don't know.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.285
He said others know too

33:06.318 --> 33:08.220
and that I'd be punished.

33:08.254 --> 33:11.023
- And did you... go to him?

33:11.057 --> 33:15.127
- I had to see who he was
for myself.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.496
- When did you see him?

33:17.529 --> 33:21.167
- Right before this.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.335
- What?

33:23.369 --> 33:25.171
- No.

33:25.204 --> 33:27.273
No, Eddie didn't do this.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.111
- Okay.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.612
- Hey, Mom.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.414
- Oh, my baby.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.256
- Where's Summer?

33:44.290 --> 33:46.592
- She's with Grandma
and Grandpa.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.095
They didn't want her to know.

33:59.171 --> 34:02.074
I know this, uh, must
be difficult for you, Mrs. Lane,

34:02.108 --> 34:04.610
but I need to ask you if you can
remember any details...

34:04.643 --> 34:07.246
- Don't understand
why the cop's here.

34:08.813 --> 34:11.083
- What?
- Um...

34:12.551 --> 34:16.688
Your mom says
someone ran her off the road.

34:18.857 --> 34:21.360
- Who?

34:21.393 --> 34:23.262
What?

34:23.295 --> 34:24.830
Cal, you have to tell me.

34:24.862 --> 34:26.697
You said you'd treat me
like a peer.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.368
- I don't know.

34:29.400 --> 34:33.639
Um... your mom told me
that she...

34:33.672 --> 34:36.108
she had a fight with your dad

34:36.141 --> 34:38.277
before she was chased
off the road,

34:38.310 --> 34:40.579
- and he... he threatened her...
- What did he say?

34:40.612 --> 34:42.148
- No.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.552
That she would be punished.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.554
Hawk, we have no proof,
all right?

34:49.588 --> 34:52.257
- This... This is...
- No. I-I know.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.824
- But...

34:53.859 --> 34:55.594
I promise you, Hawk,

34:55.627 --> 34:59.398
if he did anything to hurt her,

34:59.431 --> 35:02.334
I will not let him
get away with it.

35:02.368 --> 35:06.438
- Thank you, Cal.
- Thank you for telling me, um...

35:08.574 --> 35:10.142
Could you do me a favor

35:10.176 --> 35:13.412
and tell my mom
I'll see her at the house later?

35:13.445 --> 35:15.481
- Yeah. Hawk, what are you...
- Nothing.

35:15.514 --> 35:18.817
I just, um...
I'll see her at home.

35:23.889 --> 35:27.293
And the driver...

35:27.326 --> 35:28.894
- I don't know.
- Okay.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.662
- I wish I could tell you more.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.898
- I-I don't remember.
- All right, well,

35:32.931 --> 35:34.433
we're all done here,
Mrs. Lane.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.202
Uh, this is the stuff that was

35:36.235 --> 35:38.870
pulled out of the wreckage
of your car.

35:38.904 --> 35:41.540
- Oh. Thank you very much.

35:41.573 --> 35:44.243
- I hope you feel better.
- Thank you.

35:44.276 --> 35:45.844
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Detective.

35:45.877 --> 35:48.880
Thank you, Officer.
Thank you.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.853
- How did this get in there?

35:57.823 --> 36:00.259
She called it a donation,

36:00.292 --> 36:02.561
- but it...
- I'm sorry, to be clear,

36:02.594 --> 36:04.463
who called it a donation?

36:04.496 --> 36:06.798
- Sarah Lane.
- Thank you.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.368
Sarah Lane called it
a donation, but...

36:09.401 --> 36:10.902
- Well, she... Sarah

36:10.936 --> 36:13.405
said if I chose not to donate,

36:13.439 --> 36:15.907
she would mail the tapes
to my wife.

36:17.976 --> 36:21.547
- I was like 15,
and it was an accident.

36:21.580 --> 36:24.816
We were kids, drunk,
playing around, rough.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.453
But my wife didn't know.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.458
Sarah comes to me...

36:34.460 --> 36:35.694
I write a check.

36:35.727 --> 36:38.830
Of course,
my wife finds the check.

36:38.864 --> 36:43.602
I admit it, you know,
thinking it's in my past.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.604
But my wife takes the kid.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.439
Says she can't look at me
anymore

36:47.473 --> 36:49.741
knowing what I did
to that girl, and now?

36:49.775 --> 36:52.511
I have nothing.
She's gone, my kid's gone,

36:52.544 --> 36:55.314
and Sarah?

36:55.347 --> 36:57.549
She walks around...

36:57.583 --> 36:59.518
untouchable.

37:16.935 --> 37:23.875
*

37:37.456 --> 37:38.424
Hawk.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.892
- Where'd you get these?

37:42.928 --> 37:45.564
- Hawk, let me explain.

37:45.597 --> 37:48.300
- I packed your bags for you.

37:48.334 --> 37:50.001
You're lucky
you didn't kill her,

37:50.035 --> 37:52.604
because then I would have
killed you... I'm not kidding.

37:52.638 --> 37:55.674
- Hey, hey, Hawk...

37:55.707 --> 37:57.976
I had nothing...

37:58.009 --> 37:59.611
to do with your mother's
accident.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.380
- Oh, but you knew
there was an accident.

38:01.413 --> 38:04.516
- Yeah. The hospital called
because I am her husband.

38:04.550 --> 38:06.885
- Only technically.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.720
- Hawk...

38:08.754 --> 38:11.957
I would never hurt her,
and you know that,

38:11.990 --> 38:13.525
because you know me.

38:13.559 --> 38:14.599
- I don't know you at all.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.362
- Son...

38:16.395 --> 38:19.531
you are being used,
manipulated...

38:19.565 --> 38:20.999
Hey... hey!

38:25.971 --> 38:30.376
*

38:30.409 --> 38:32.478
- Let go of me, Eddie.

38:36.615 --> 38:40.452
I think it would be better
for everyone...

38:40.486 --> 38:42.421
if you were gone.

38:46.392 --> 38:48.326
- Hawk...

38:58.770 --> 39:02.708
- If I'm reading this right,
this is incredible.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.776
This can't all be
coincidence, right?

39:04.810 --> 39:06.878
I mean, it could be
the same person who...

39:06.912 --> 39:08.880
Who ran me off the road
last night.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.650
- Well, let's try and figure out
how it got in your car first.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.485
- That's what I'm doing.

39:13.519 --> 39:14.920
- Is that...

39:30.135 --> 39:32.638
Uh... you found her?

39:32.671 --> 39:35.173
- Mary?
- Okay.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.942
Mary?

39:36.975 --> 39:38.677
Wrap the blanket
around her shoulders.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.045
You bring water?

39:43.114 --> 39:45.517
*

39:56.828 --> 39:58.597
- What are you doing?

40:00.866 --> 40:03.134
- I was wondering if ya...

40:03.168 --> 40:05.804
had a couch I could use.

40:07.606 --> 40:09.708
- Yeah. Take the house.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.744
Key's in the box.
It's paid through the month.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.546
- Where're you going?

40:16.682 --> 40:19.217
- Look, I...

40:19.250 --> 40:21.920
I'm done, okay?

40:21.953 --> 40:25.824
I just can't do this anymore.

40:25.857 --> 40:28.594
- There's, uh... Lots of good
has come from this.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.095
- Really?

40:30.128 --> 40:32.598
What?

40:32.631 --> 40:34.600
Honestly, what good
has come from this?

40:34.633 --> 40:36.835
- We've helped people,
and we can help more.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.670
- Well, we'll never
get the chance

40:38.704 --> 40:41.707
because it's all Cal
and Sarah now,

40:41.740 --> 40:44.643
and they're gonna
burn it... to the ground.

40:44.676 --> 40:47.513
You know what Sarah's doing
with your unburdening sessions?

40:47.546 --> 40:50.716
She's using them
to blackmail people.

40:50.749 --> 40:56.187
See, there's a fine line
between a tool and a weapon.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.223
Just cut your losses now,
Richard.

40:58.256 --> 41:00.559
- No one will blame you.
- We have to try.

41:00.592 --> 41:01.893
We have to try to fix it.

41:01.927 --> 41:04.029
- Look, there's nothing to fix.

41:04.062 --> 41:06.865
- I sacrificed everything.

41:06.898 --> 41:10.536
It has to be for something.

41:10.569 --> 41:13.639
- It should be.

41:13.672 --> 41:17.008
I'm sorry, Richard.

41:17.042 --> 41:19.645
I really am.

41:19.678 --> 41:21.847
You bet on the wrong horse.

41:24.115 --> 41:25.684
- But...

41:25.717 --> 41:27.586
but...

41:27.619 --> 41:30.722
but the last rung
of The Ladder is Augur.

41:30.756 --> 41:34.092
It requires no work, no study.

41:34.125 --> 41:37.596
It will come to you,
so you will see!

41:43.234 --> 41:49.274
*

41:58.684 --> 42:00.118
- Hi.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.260
How's, uh, how's everyone doing?

42:19.638 --> 42:21.940
I'm sorry, Sarah.

42:32.183 --> 42:35.921
- I take all the responsibility.

42:35.954 --> 42:38.724
I was asleep, intoxicated.

42:38.757 --> 42:41.092
I don't know what I was.

42:41.126 --> 42:43.829
I can't be mad at you

42:43.862 --> 42:47.365
when I had all the information.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.267
I had Silas's body...

42:49.300 --> 42:52.704
What more did I need?

42:52.738 --> 42:54.305
I knew who you were.

42:57.175 --> 43:00.779
- I'm not asleep anymore.

43:00.812 --> 43:03.815
I'm wide fucking awake.

43:05.350 --> 43:07.853
Hold your son.

43:07.886 --> 43:10.255
He'll need you.

43:20.131 --> 43:23.769
*

44:06.845 --> 44:13.752
*

44:29.835 --> 44:34.039
We are gathered here
this morning

44:34.072 --> 44:36.374
to bless a new life,

44:36.407 --> 44:40.311
greatest creation
of The Light's love.

44:46.284 --> 44:48.987
Welcome, little one...

44:49.020 --> 44:51.723
to our world.

44:51.757 --> 44:54.793
You are whole,
and you are broken,

44:54.826 --> 44:58.163
as we all are.

44:58.196 --> 45:02.333
We're all alone in the world,

45:02.367 --> 45:04.402
but we're your family.

45:12.477 --> 45:14.913
Let this child love

45:14.946 --> 45:17.916
and know what it is to be loved.

45:21.486 --> 45:23.789
- And joy.

45:23.822 --> 45:25.991
We wish this baby joy.

45:26.024 --> 45:27.759
And jokes.

45:27.793 --> 45:29.094
Lots of 'em.

45:29.127 --> 45:31.262
Cal Roberts is a snake!

45:33.264 --> 45:35.400
Cal wrote the final rungs!

45:35.433 --> 45:38.203
Cal is a false Guardian!

45:38.236 --> 45:40.806
The Light has chosen Eddie Lane!

45:40.839 --> 45:42.307
Eddie Lane!

45:42.340 --> 45:44.542
Stay where you are.

45:49.347 --> 45:51.416
The door is locked!

45:51.449 --> 45:54.152
Okay, Devin, Devin,
go down, check the other door.

45:54.185 --> 45:56.788
Go now! Now!

45:56.822 --> 46:00.959
Find a phone, call... call Sarah.
Call the guardhouse.

46:00.992 --> 46:03.294
Everybody stay calm!

46:10.335 --> 46:17.175
*

46:17.208 --> 46:19.577
Eddie Lane will return

46:19.610 --> 46:22.814
and build The Garden!

46:22.848 --> 46:26.952
He is the chosen son!

46:26.985 --> 46:31.422
- Richard?
- Cal Roberts is a snake!

46:34.893 --> 46:36.895
- It's... it's gonna be okay.

46:39.931 --> 46:46.838
*

46:49.474 --> 46:52.077
Richard?

46:59.050 --> 47:00.351
Richard?

47:05.991 --> 47:07.492
You try.
3-3-7-3.

47:29.180 --> 47:31.016
- He changed the code.

47:33.318 --> 47:35.520
Richard!

47:35.553 --> 47:37.655
What are you doing?

47:37.688 --> 47:40.458
Let me in.

47:54.572 --> 47:56.341
Richard...

47:56.374 --> 47:59.177
listen to me.

47:59.210 --> 48:01.412
What are you doing?

48:18.729 --> 48:20.098
- Shit!

48:34.679 --> 48:38.216
- Richard...
- what are you doing in there?

48:42.553 --> 48:44.956
Sarah.

49:15.486 --> 49:17.155
- Sarah...

49:18.723 --> 49:20.358
Run!

49:37.542 --> 49:44.482
*

49:47.218 --> 49:53.024
* When the morning breaks

49:53.058 --> 49:57.595
* Chase away the snakes

49:57.628 --> 49:59.730
* Is it my fate

49:59.764 --> 50:03.634
*

50:03.668 --> 50:08.039
* To dream of snakes

50:08.073 --> 50:14.512
*
