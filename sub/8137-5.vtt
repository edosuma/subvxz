00:27.827 --> 00:28.885
Who are you, anyway?

00:28.962 --> 00:31.192
I'm Norman Baines.
What's in the sack?

00:31.264 --> 00:32.356
All right.

00:35.068 --> 00:38.265
36 Fairview Road.

00:39.672 --> 00:41.936
Boy, this place
looks really familiar.

00:43.009 --> 00:44.067
Nah.

00:45.478 --> 00:47.969
Well, then I'll have to
put a curse on you.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.778
Michael, look out.

01:05.698 --> 01:08.098
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

01:08.168 --> 01:10.659
into the dangerous world
of a man...

01:10.737 --> 01:12.466
who does not exist.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.347
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:22.415 --> 01:25.009
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:25.085 --> 01:27.178
the helpless, the powerless...

01:27.253 --> 01:30.745
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

03:44.023 --> 03:46.048
Would you please keep it down?

03:47.293 --> 03:49.488
At least until
you get to the party.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.862
And Halloween's
still two days away.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.216
Who's there?

05:25.158 --> 05:26.523
Michael.

05:28.361 --> 05:30.420
Happy new apartment!

05:31.130 --> 05:32.654
They're beautiful.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.530
They smell great.
Take my word for it.

05:36.135 --> 05:38.365
Check this place out!

05:41.574 --> 05:42.905
Now if I can find a vase.

05:42.975 --> 05:46.138
The only one I've unpacked
I'm using for a juice pitcher.

05:46.245 --> 05:47.269
No problem.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.110
Okay, let's see...

05:49.749 --> 05:50.738
Vase...

05:52.652 --> 05:55.621
This should fit in great with
your decorating scheme.

05:59.959 --> 06:01.551
How you doing, sweetheart?

06:01.627 --> 06:04.095
Physically,
I'm feeling better.

06:06.599 --> 06:08.999
Emotionally,
I'm really glad you came by.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.409
Are you all right?

06:21.013 --> 06:22.275
Devon told me.

06:23.349 --> 06:25.112
And you think I'm losing
my mind, don't you?

06:25.184 --> 06:26.913
I mean, that's why
you're being so nice to me.

06:26.986 --> 06:28.112
Ouch.

06:28.187 --> 06:30.382
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that, I...

06:32.191 --> 06:35.319
I just can't get the image of
that girl out of my mind.

06:35.628 --> 06:37.858
Bonnie,
that is why I'm here.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.860
Now, where did it happen?

06:46.239 --> 06:47.900
Apartment 302.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.073
302, all right.

06:50.977 --> 06:54.037
I'm going with you. I suggest
you bring your tissues.

06:56.682 --> 06:59.879
Would you kindly get that
black furball off my roof?

07:00.887 --> 07:02.718
Voodoo is my familiar.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.418
And he helps me
with all my magic.

07:05.491 --> 07:08.119
Then see if he'll help you
make him disappear.

07:08.628 --> 07:09.856
Thank you.

07:21.874 --> 07:23.171
Hello?

07:28.981 --> 07:32.417
What? Michael, there was furniture here.

07:32.485 --> 07:35.921
There were wall hangings. There
was a bar setup. There was...

07:35.988 --> 07:39.424
There was a lamp. She knocked
it over when she fell. I saw it!

07:39.492 --> 07:41.858
Bonnie, are you sure
this is the right apartment?

07:41.928 --> 07:43.418
I'm positive.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.793
That's my apartment
diagonally across.

07:45.865 --> 07:50.199
It's a clear view. Bonnie, it
was dark, and with the fever...

07:50.770 --> 07:52.499
I saw it.

07:53.706 --> 07:56.698
Hey, hey. It's okay.
It's just a cross-draft.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.767
Come on, let's get back
to your apartment.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.347
You're not quitting on me?

08:07.887 --> 08:09.684
You know me
better than that.

08:09.755 --> 08:11.484
Now, where was
that party?

08:12.058 --> 08:13.252
104.

08:13.726 --> 08:18.322
Michael... I know. A
black gorilla suit. Gotcha.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.321
Hi, my name is Michael Knight.

08:45.391 --> 08:48.087
I understand there was a party
here last night.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.895
Party? Now where did you
ever hear that?

08:52.198 --> 08:53.927
The Great Pumpkin told me.

08:54.133 --> 08:55.361
Can I come in?

08:55.434 --> 08:58.699
Well, any friend of the Great
Pumpkin's is a friend of mine.

09:02.108 --> 09:05.737
As you can see, it was
just an intimate affair.

09:05.811 --> 09:09.474
Yeah, for like, maybe six or
seven of your closest friends.

09:10.316 --> 09:11.305
Yes.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.814
Well, what can I do for you?

09:14.887 --> 09:17.378
I got a friend who just
moved into this building.

09:17.456 --> 09:20.425
Last night she thought she
saw something very strange.

09:21.127 --> 09:22.890
Did you have
any trouble here?

09:22.962 --> 09:24.987
You mean like
running out of ice?

09:25.131 --> 09:28.259
No, I mean like
a gorilla going ape.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.565
Maybe even
hurting somebody.

09:31.537 --> 09:32.561
Well.

09:32.638 --> 09:33.764
Let me see.

09:34.006 --> 09:35.997
We had at least
a dozen Boy Georges...

09:36.075 --> 09:38.270
a couple of
breakdancing mummies...

09:38.678 --> 09:40.305
and one John DeLorean.

09:40.846 --> 09:43.906
But no one came dressed as
a gorilla. That I'd remember.

09:44.016 --> 09:45.950
Because I like hairy men.

09:48.721 --> 09:52.714
That's either rave reviews for the
party or my landlord asking me to move.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.582
If you'll excuse me.

09:54.660 --> 09:57.356
Yeah, thanks for the help,
I'll find the door.

09:58.731 --> 09:59.720
Hello?

10:00.633 --> 10:03.534
Larry? Yes, I had a ball, too.

10:24.924 --> 10:26.551
It's a dream!

10:26.726 --> 10:28.921
I think she means "nightmare".

10:29.495 --> 10:33.192
Michael, if she's trick-or-treating,
tell her she's a day early.

10:33.499 --> 10:36.866
It's exactly what we need for
the Witches' and Warlocks' Ball.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.337
My name is Esmeralda.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.532
And I'm the top witch
of the Northern Hemi.

10:41.607 --> 10:44.576
You wouldn't, by any chance,
be a warlock, would you?

10:44.777 --> 10:46.142
I don't think so.

10:46.512 --> 10:47.501
Pity.

10:47.913 --> 10:51.371
It's so difficult to find
a good warlock these days.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.577
Have you tried
Warlocks Anonymous?

10:54.387 --> 10:58.323
Well, are you going to let me have him
for my witch-mobile tomorrow night or not?

10:58.391 --> 10:59.619
Witch-mobile?

10:59.792 --> 11:02.852
I'm sorry, but I think
he has other commitments.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.720
Well, then I'll have to
put a curse on you.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.889
One that
you will never forget.

11:08.434 --> 11:09.731
Come, Voodoo...

11:09.902 --> 11:12.268
we must take our newts
out of the oven.

11:13.873 --> 11:16.967
If you ask me, Michael,
she has newts in her belfry.

11:17.209 --> 11:19.302
Let's hope
they stay there.

11:21.047 --> 11:23.845
Run this through your
analyzer, will you, partner?

11:31.891 --> 11:33.688
It's hair from a real gorilla.

11:33.759 --> 11:37.160
Why did Bonnie have to choose
one of those singles' buildings?

11:38.264 --> 11:42.928
Relax. This monkey probably
hasn't peeled any bananas lately.

11:44.403 --> 11:49.397
You know, KITT, there can't be too many
places that rent out real gorilla-hair suits.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.041
Check it out, will you, pal?

11:51.110 --> 11:52.577
Right away.

12:12.131 --> 12:13.496
302, right, pal?

12:13.999 --> 12:15.227
Exactly.

12:26.879 --> 12:28.005
Please don't hurt me.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.173
Hurt you? You almost
potted me into the pavement.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.683
I was just putting flowers
in that planter and...

12:32.752 --> 12:34.219
And it fell over
by itself, huh?

12:34.286 --> 12:36.186
Come on, you can do better
than that. No. No, no.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.620
I bumped it,
but it was an accident.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.180
Why would I
want to hurt you?

12:39.258 --> 12:40.555
You tell me.

12:42.461 --> 12:43.519
Who are you, anyway?

12:43.596 --> 12:46.963
I'm Norman, Norman Baines.
I'm custodian of this building.

12:47.833 --> 12:50.563
You're a friend of
Bonnie Barstow's, aren't you?

12:50.669 --> 12:52.261
How did you know that?

12:52.972 --> 12:55.065
I saw you bring her
some flowers.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.439
I hope she'll be happy here.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.472
Yeah, so do I.

13:01.046 --> 13:03.207
How long has
this apartment been vacant?

13:03.282 --> 13:05.307
Three, maybe four months.

13:05.584 --> 13:07.711
Which is it, three or four?
Four.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.486
Who wants to know?

13:09.855 --> 13:11.584
My name is Michael Knight.

13:11.857 --> 13:14.018
Excuse me,
I didn't catch your name.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.554
Grant.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.461
This is my building,
are you interested in renting?

13:19.698 --> 13:22.667
Somebody told me that this
was a furnished apartment.

13:22.902 --> 13:24.426
Well,
someone told you wrong...

13:24.503 --> 13:26.869
the furnished apartments
are in the other wing.

13:26.939 --> 13:27.928
Well?

13:29.475 --> 13:30.999
I'll get back to you.

13:49.428 --> 13:51.862
Lobby.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.294
Garage.

13:57.403 --> 13:58.631
Laundry room.

14:24.129 --> 14:25.391
Michael!

14:25.731 --> 14:28.791
The girl from last night,
she's floating in my bathtub!

14:41.280 --> 14:43.271
She's dead,
isn't she, Michael?

14:44.350 --> 14:45.817
Bonnie, look.

14:51.490 --> 14:55.221
I heard the water running. She
was there, she was right there!

14:55.461 --> 14:57.292
Michael, am I going crazy?

14:57.363 --> 15:00.491
No, Bonnie, but somebody sure
wants you to think you are.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.394
Take it easy, okay?

15:02.801 --> 15:04.735
I'm gonna find out
who's doing this to you.

15:04.803 --> 15:08.671
I promise you, I'm gonna
find out who and why.

16:10.235 --> 16:13.363
Are you all right? Your pulse
and respiration are racing.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.128
I'm fine.

16:15.674 --> 16:18.370
Just a little too much
Halloween in here.

16:37.262 --> 16:40.390
KITT, is this
the genuine article?

16:43.435 --> 16:44.993
A perfect match.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.164
Well, what do you know?

16:49.241 --> 16:52.108
Looks like we just rented
ourselves a gorilla suit.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.615
Oh, good, you found one.

16:57.683 --> 17:01.175
You'll make a great King Kong.
Denise, I need to talk to you.

17:01.253 --> 17:03.881
Well, come on in.
Do you like Brie or Gouda?

17:04.022 --> 17:06.548
Cut the tap dance, Denise.
You lied to me.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.252
Something wrong?

17:08.426 --> 17:09.758
Michael?

17:10.128 --> 17:11.425
Oh, you two know each other?

17:11.497 --> 17:13.761
Michael, this is Simon. He
and Denise were kind enough...

17:13.832 --> 17:15.823
to throw me a "welcome
to the building" party.

17:15.901 --> 17:18.131
Nothing fancy.
Cheese, a little Beaujolais.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.694
I thought these two
should meet each other.

17:20.939 --> 17:23.406
That's very nice,
but I didn't come to party.

17:23.474 --> 17:24.942
Let's get back
to the beginning.

17:25.010 --> 17:28.411
You'll never guess where
I found this gorilla costume.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.471
Central Costume.
With your name on it.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.016
I took it back today.

17:32.084 --> 17:33.745
I thought
I asked you this morning...

17:33.819 --> 17:35.946
If anybody at the party
wore a gorilla suit.

17:36.021 --> 17:38.922
I said no. I never took
that thing out of the closet.

17:38.991 --> 17:42.427
So, you just rented it, brought
it home, and then took it back.

17:42.494 --> 17:44.655
That's right.
I changed my mind.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.799
I mean, really, do I look
like the gorilla type to you?

17:47.866 --> 17:51.666
If you didn't wear it, Denise, why'd you
have it cleaned before you returned it?

17:51.737 --> 17:53.261
Now you're hallucinating.

17:53.338 --> 17:54.805
I'm not that conscientious.

17:54.873 --> 17:59.105
For your sake, you better be telling the
truth because if I find out that you're not...

17:59.178 --> 18:00.770
Excuse me, Michael...

18:00.846 --> 18:03.212
Thank you two, for the party.

18:03.282 --> 18:06.046
And don't mind Michael.
We're just leaving.

18:14.726 --> 18:16.785
Do you really think
Denise is involved?

18:16.862 --> 18:17.954
You don't?

18:18.030 --> 18:20.498
I don't know,
she seems very nice.

18:20.732 --> 18:23.132
Not exactly my image
of a murderess.

18:23.635 --> 18:26.536
Yeah well, that's what they
said about Lizzie Borden.

18:27.039 --> 18:30.497
Look, I had KITT analyze
the suit for foreign matter.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.840
You know, blood, hair...

18:32.911 --> 18:33.900
And?

18:34.313 --> 18:36.975
Nothing, but that's probably
because it was cleaned.

18:37.049 --> 18:40.576
I could program KITT to analyze the solvent.
It would just take a couple of hours.

18:40.652 --> 18:44.383
I'm way ahead of you. It's Parkdale Cleaners
on Wilson. We're on our way there now.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.447
How could you trace it
so fast?

18:46.525 --> 18:48.356
I read ticket on hanger.

18:50.529 --> 18:52.087
You going to be okay?

18:52.731 --> 18:55.427
Yeah, as soon as I can find
the right key to this door.

18:55.501 --> 18:58.664
This building has more locks
than a Federal Reserve Bank.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.767
See you later.
Got it.

19:08.847 --> 19:10.007
Yeah?

19:12.217 --> 19:13.707
Knight again.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.610
That's too bad.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.650
That costume's your problem.

19:20.526 --> 19:22.517
Of course
I still want the key.

19:23.695 --> 19:27.187
And try not to
do anything stupid.

19:36.642 --> 19:38.166
Trunk, por favor.

19:38.377 --> 19:40.845
I hope that monstrosity
doesn't shed.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.937
You'll never guess
who brought it in, pal.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.209
Norman Baines.

19:44.283 --> 19:45.477
Norman?

19:45.551 --> 19:47.143
But Michael, how?

19:47.219 --> 19:49.585
Well, he probably
got it out of Denise's closet.

19:49.655 --> 19:50.952
Think about it.

19:54.993 --> 19:57.052
Go anywhere,
do anything he wants.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.063
He's got keys to
every lock in the building.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.530
Michael, look out.

20:10.642 --> 20:12.371
All right, let's get him.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.008
We can't clear it, Michael,
we're too close.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.809
Let's go for it!

21:09.768 --> 21:11.497
KITT, can you pick him up?

21:12.671 --> 21:15.731
No, Michael, wherever he is,
he's out of scanner range.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.170
Hello, Norman.

22:30.248 --> 22:31.647
What are you doing here?

22:31.717 --> 22:33.981
How did you get in?
That's trespassing!

22:34.052 --> 22:36.452
No, it's not.
It's breaking and entering.

22:36.822 --> 22:37.982
What's in the sack?

22:38.056 --> 22:39.080
Get out of here!

22:39.157 --> 22:40.886
The sack, Norman.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.891
What's the knife in
the boot for?

22:42.961 --> 22:43.950
No!

22:44.463 --> 22:46.090
You did it, didn't you?

22:47.466 --> 22:48.831
I need a lawyer.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.194
You can't do this
if I don't have a lawyer.

22:51.269 --> 22:55.035
Yeah, well, I'm not a cop, and
there'll be plenty of time for lawyers.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.401
All right.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.138
I confess.

23:00.445 --> 23:04.245
I knew I shouldn't have done it,
but I just couldn't stop myself.

23:04.649 --> 23:06.446
I've been doing it for years.

23:16.194 --> 23:17.354
Pumpkins?

23:17.662 --> 23:20.756
I always raid a patch
the night before Halloween.

23:21.032 --> 23:22.863
Are you going to turn me in?

23:23.435 --> 23:27.701
No, I just wanna ask you
a couple of questions, okay?

23:29.641 --> 23:32.701
Why don't we just sit down
here and have a little talk?

23:38.984 --> 23:40.144
Norman...

23:41.019 --> 23:44.386
did you go to Denise's party
in a gorilla suit?

23:44.589 --> 23:47.080
No, I couldn't make
Denise's party.

23:48.527 --> 23:50.995
Then why did you take the
gorilla suit to the cleaner's?

23:51.062 --> 23:53.496
As a favor for Denise.

23:53.565 --> 23:55.829
She offered me five dollars,
but...

23:56.535 --> 23:58.025
I refused it.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.627
Because she's your friend.

23:59.704 --> 24:03.299
Yes, and if you don't believe it,
you can just go ask her yourself.

24:03.475 --> 24:04.999
I think I'll do that.

24:05.310 --> 24:06.868
She's not there.

24:07.646 --> 24:09.170
Do you know where she is?

24:09.247 --> 24:10.612
She's gone away.

24:11.716 --> 24:14.514
Somehow you make that sound
so permanent.

24:15.153 --> 24:17.348
No, just until tomorrow.

24:17.422 --> 24:20.789
I know, because she asked me to
keep an eye on her place for her.

24:20.859 --> 24:22.326
Another favor, huh?

24:22.761 --> 24:23.750
Yes.

24:23.862 --> 24:24.988
Thank you.

24:51.523 --> 24:54.515
KITT ran the sedan's plates
through the DMV's computer.

24:54.593 --> 24:56.959
Guess what?
They were stolen.

24:57.028 --> 24:59.053
If we only had
a viable suspect.

24:59.865 --> 25:00.991
We do.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.965
Denise Reynolds? What could she
possibly have against Bonnie?

25:05.036 --> 25:06.628
When I find her,
I'll ask her.

25:06.705 --> 25:08.332
Bonnie, I think
for the moment...

25:08.406 --> 25:11.204
I'm not leaving my apartment,
Devon. That's final.

25:11.843 --> 25:12.867
All right.

25:12.944 --> 25:16.402
Besides, I don't think Denise is strong
enough to have overpowered that woman.

25:16.481 --> 25:19.006
Not normally, but under
pressure, who knows?

25:19.084 --> 25:23.180
Come on, let's go back to your place,
I want to see if Miss Halloween's home.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.367
Well, hello, there.
Hi.

25:37.435 --> 25:39.027
You don't feel like
some tennis, do you?

25:39.104 --> 25:41.265
Thanks, but I think
that'd be pushing it.

25:41.339 --> 25:42.567
I just got stood up.

25:42.641 --> 25:44.108
Denise and I
had a date for noon.

25:44.175 --> 25:45.199
She's not in?

25:45.277 --> 25:47.643
Knowing Denise,
she forgot all about it.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.244
You guys,
excuse me, huh?

25:53.184 --> 25:56.244
You can save yourself a trip.
I can use the exercise.

25:58.156 --> 26:00.056
I've been calling you
all morning long.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.650
How'd you like to go to a
costume party with me tonight?

26:02.727 --> 26:06.527
I'd love to, but I can't. My
boss is having a Halloween party.

26:10.769 --> 26:13.033
Would you like to take me
to my party?

26:13.104 --> 26:14.162
Now you're talking.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.331
You've got a date.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.396
Okay.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.777
8:00. And don't be late.

26:34.559 --> 26:37.050
I think Bonnie
went to her apartment.

26:37.495 --> 26:39.622
You know,
that is one terrific lady.

26:39.698 --> 26:42.189
Bright, funny,
great-looking...

26:42.801 --> 26:44.063
Weak backhand.

26:44.502 --> 26:45.662
All the better.

26:45.737 --> 26:47.671
But let me ask you
a question.

26:47.939 --> 26:49.873
About these hallucinations...

26:50.041 --> 26:51.440
I'm working on it.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.901
I'd hate to see anything
happen to her.

26:53.979 --> 26:57.540
You know, sometimes you meet a girl
that pushes all the right buttons.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.278
Michael! Michael!

27:02.687 --> 27:04.814
What is it? What's wrong?

27:08.827 --> 27:11.295
I'll call the police.
No, not from here.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.097
Oh, right.
There could be prints.

27:13.164 --> 27:14.893
Who would do
something like this?

27:14.966 --> 27:16.991
When was the last time
you saw Denise?

27:17.068 --> 27:19.127
You don't think that she...
Let's put it this way.

27:19.204 --> 27:21.104
If they hung people for
circumstantial evidence...

27:21.172 --> 27:23.868
right now she'd be
slowly twisting in the wind.

27:59.644 --> 28:00.770
Bonnie?

28:07.252 --> 28:08.276
What?

28:37.115 --> 28:38.707
Here it is.
What's that?

28:38.783 --> 28:40.080
Proof.
Proof?

28:40.151 --> 28:41.675
That Bonnie
wasn't hallucinating.

28:41.753 --> 28:45.211
It's a hologram projector
with a minicassette recorder.

28:48.693 --> 28:50.183
There's your running water.

28:50.261 --> 28:51.888
Thank heavens.

28:51.963 --> 28:53.828
But why?
To scare her.

28:54.099 --> 28:57.728
To make her think the murder she
really saw was something in her head.

28:59.971 --> 29:02.462
Great, now if only
we could speak gremlin...

29:02.540 --> 29:03.666
KITT might.

29:04.709 --> 29:07.337
KITT, see if you can make
some sense of this.

29:17.288 --> 29:19.586
Not a very sophisticated
code, Michael.

29:20.158 --> 29:22.718
You mean it's just a
tape-recorded message backwards?

29:22.794 --> 29:24.785
Yes. And when I reverse it...

29:25.797 --> 29:30.029
36 Fairview Road...
36 Fairview Road...

29:30.235 --> 29:32.066
Sounds like
the place to be.

29:32.504 --> 29:33.630
You coming?

29:34.105 --> 29:35.470
Try and stop me.

30:01.166 --> 30:03.464
Boy, this place looks
really familiar.

30:06.037 --> 30:07.026
Nah.

31:05.263 --> 31:07.959
Somebody has got a real
morbid sense of humor.

31:08.466 --> 31:10.093
I wouldn't go that far.

31:10.602 --> 31:11.591
Morbid?

31:11.669 --> 31:13.296
Sense of humor.

31:13.938 --> 31:15.166
I gotcha.

31:16.074 --> 31:18.770
You wait here. I'm going
to take a look inside.

31:18.843 --> 31:19.832
Right.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.025
Michael!
What?

31:43.534 --> 31:45.001
Don't worry, Bonnie.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.300
It's just a...
It's her.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.498
The girl I saw murdered.

32:12.497 --> 32:13.521
Gas!

32:14.632 --> 32:16.122
KITT, we need you in here.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.361
It smells like gas, buddy.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.230
I'm on my way, Michael.

32:39.724 --> 32:40.850
KITT, hurry!

32:40.959 --> 32:42.688
Right away, Michael.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.091
Come on.

33:21.566 --> 33:22.931
It's small consolation...

33:23.001 --> 33:26.835
but at least you know now that you
were not hallucinating about the murder.

33:26.904 --> 33:28.804
I will never
doubt you again.

33:29.507 --> 33:30.599
Poor girl.

33:31.042 --> 33:32.304
Did you know
who she was?

33:32.377 --> 33:35.141
According to the police,
her name was Linda Ramsden.

33:35.213 --> 33:36.578
You're not gonna
believe this.

33:36.647 --> 33:41.277
According to KITT, her last address
was Greenview Terrace, Apartment 212.

33:42.453 --> 33:43.852
That's my apartment.

33:43.921 --> 33:47.186
Yeah, I know. Which may have
explained why your place was ransacked.

33:47.258 --> 33:51.058
Linda must have hidden something in there,
something the killer wanted very badly.

33:51.129 --> 33:54.030
The apartment was empty when
I moved in, what could it be?

33:54.098 --> 33:55.190
I don't know.

33:55.266 --> 33:58.030
I was hoping Edward Grant,
your landlord, could tell me.

33:58.102 --> 34:00.935
That's a lot for
a landlord to know, Michael.

34:01.005 --> 34:03.667
Not when you consider he owns
this cozy little hideaway.

34:03.741 --> 34:05.538
It used to belong
to his mother.

34:28.733 --> 34:29.859
Wow.

34:30.935 --> 34:34.199
Looks like Mr. Grant's got
the Midas touch, huh, pal?

34:34.972 --> 34:36.803
What are his other holdings?

34:36.908 --> 34:38.306
A chain of grocery stores...

34:38.376 --> 34:41.675
and a company that's a major
supplier to the movie industry.

34:41.746 --> 34:45.773
Don't tell me. Special effects,
as in hologram projectors?

34:45.850 --> 34:48.318
Michael, sometimes I wonder
if you really need me.

34:48.386 --> 34:51.219
Are you kidding?
I couldn't do it without you.

34:51.289 --> 34:52.880
Keep your scanners peeled.

35:06.904 --> 35:08.963
You know, we've got to
stop meeting like this.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.201
Well, it's not
the impossible dream.

35:11.342 --> 35:13.242
You know, maybe you're right.

35:13.444 --> 35:15.912
Norman told me
all about the gorilla suit.

35:16.147 --> 35:17.774
Norman has a big mouth.

35:24.722 --> 35:27.589
Mr. Knight, just what
are you doing here?

35:27.658 --> 35:30.149
Come on, Denise,
yesterday it was Michael.

35:30.394 --> 35:33.522
And assuming you don't always
pay your rent in person...

35:33.664 --> 35:35.632
I could ask you
the same thing.

35:35.733 --> 35:37.462
She belongs here, Knight.

35:42.507 --> 35:43.872
She's my daughter.

35:45.276 --> 35:47.176
And you haven't any manners.

35:47.678 --> 35:49.805
I never do
when it comes to murder.

35:52.216 --> 35:55.947
Honey, will you excuse us?
This won't take long.

35:57.054 --> 36:00.512
It's a pity.
You had such potential.

36:00.691 --> 36:02.488
Yeah, the story of my life.

36:07.265 --> 36:08.892
Would you like a drink?

36:09.033 --> 36:11.126
It's not a social call, Grant.

36:14.438 --> 36:16.702
When you reach
my position in life...

36:17.275 --> 36:19.835
you can afford to mix
business with pleasure.

36:21.045 --> 36:23.605
As in the case of
Linda Ramsden, huh?

36:26.751 --> 36:28.480
What about Linda Ramsden?

36:29.253 --> 36:32.051
Well, she's dead,
in case you haven't heard.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.319
I'm sorry to hear that.

36:36.561 --> 36:39.462
Well I got something that's
really gonna make your day here.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.464
Guess where we found her body.

36:43.734 --> 36:46.897
Your "guest house"
on Fairview Road.

36:47.071 --> 36:51.633
What was it, some kind of winter-spring
romance that ended up in blackmail?

36:53.377 --> 36:55.242
You're pushing me, Knight.

36:56.180 --> 36:59.343
I got it. She was getting very greedy,
and threatened to tell your wife.

36:59.417 --> 37:00.543
Leave my wife out of this.

37:00.618 --> 37:02.108
What did Linda hide
in Bonnie's apartment?

37:02.186 --> 37:03.847
Photographs, letters, tapes?

37:03.921 --> 37:07.084
What did you want so badly
that you murdered Linda for it?

37:07.458 --> 37:11.087
She was bleeding me dry,
that little tramp!

37:12.230 --> 37:15.927
Taking money that belonged
to my family, my children.

37:17.335 --> 37:18.734
But I didn't kill her...

37:18.803 --> 37:21.704
and you can't prove that
I did, now get out of here!

37:22.540 --> 37:26.408
You know, some of your illusions are
a lot more convincing than you are.

37:29.614 --> 37:31.605
But I got some
special effects of my own.

37:31.682 --> 37:34.674
Like making you disappear
for 20 years, man.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.802
Will you excuse me?

38:03.748 --> 38:06.410
Miss Scarlett, how very kind
of you to come.

38:08.819 --> 38:13.313
Whatever else is a lady to do when one
receives an invitation from Louis XVI?

38:14.525 --> 38:16.288
Louis XIV, Bonnie.

38:16.460 --> 38:17.984
Louis XVI was beheaded...

38:18.062 --> 38:21.088
for what they said was his tyrannical
treatment of his subjects...

38:21.165 --> 38:23.793
his insensitivities
toward his fellow men...

38:24.135 --> 38:26.865
his blind arrogance,
his...

38:27.338 --> 38:31.001
And this must be the young man
I've heard so much about. Simon.

38:31.542 --> 38:34.102
Simon left a message on my
service saying he couldn't make it.

38:34.178 --> 38:35.338
Something about business.

38:35.413 --> 38:37.347
So, I brought Norman Baines.

38:38.616 --> 38:39.913
How very nice.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.474
Nice to meet you, Norman.

38:41.552 --> 38:42.917
Enjoy yourselves.

38:44.055 --> 38:45.283
Is Michael here yet?

38:45.356 --> 38:48.154
No, not yet, but I'm
sure he's on his way.

38:50.194 --> 38:51.855
Michael,
I thought Rhett Butler...

38:51.929 --> 38:53.692
was supposed to be
dashing and carefree.

38:53.764 --> 38:55.493
You're acting like Hamlet.

38:55.966 --> 38:59.026
KITT, I know how important
this party is to Devon...

39:00.071 --> 39:02.403
but I can't stop thinking
about the case.

39:02.473 --> 39:03.963
I'm sure it's just
a matter of time...

39:04.041 --> 39:07.101
before you get the evidence
you need to put Grant away.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.835
That's just it, pal.

39:09.547 --> 39:13.176
As much as I don't like the guy, I'm
not convinced he's guilty, either.

39:13.250 --> 39:14.547
He did have a motive...

39:14.618 --> 39:17.485
Yeah,
and a lot more imagination...

39:17.555 --> 39:21.685
than to bury the body in the house
he owns and then lead us right to it.

39:22.993 --> 39:25.985
Give me what you got on Grant's
personal history, will you?

39:26.063 --> 39:27.928
Coming right up, Michael.

39:27.998 --> 39:31.195
"Born Edward Joseph Grant,
1924...

39:31.268 --> 39:34.465
"married 1950,
one child, Denise. "

39:34.538 --> 39:35.664
One child?

39:36.974 --> 39:39.568
That's strange,
he talked about children.

39:40.010 --> 39:41.671
There's got to be
another somewhere.

39:41.746 --> 39:42.974
Michael, you're right.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.914
There was another child
by a first marriage, a son.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.208
Between stints
in the family business...

39:48.285 --> 39:50.810
he's been in and out
of mental institutions.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.480
What's his name, KITT?

39:55.626 --> 39:57.526
Oh, no.

39:57.895 --> 39:59.522
I'm afraid so, Michael.

39:59.964 --> 40:01.261
See if you can reach Devon.

40:01.332 --> 40:04.062
We've got to get to Bonnie
before it's too late.

40:04.335 --> 40:06.064
Norman, I'm sure
no one would mind...

40:06.137 --> 40:08.970
if you took your mask off
just to drink your champagne.

40:09.039 --> 40:12.839
It's quite all right, Bonnie, I've
been practicing for this all year.

40:17.948 --> 40:19.540
You all right, Norman?

40:20.618 --> 40:23.746
Yes, if I could maybe
just rest a minute.

40:23.888 --> 40:26.413
Come on, there's a couch
in the hallway.

40:45.376 --> 40:46.968
You can lie down here.

40:51.048 --> 40:52.845
Is something wrong, Norman?

40:56.987 --> 40:58.181
Norman...

40:59.824 --> 41:00.950
What is it?

41:03.861 --> 41:05.158
Norman!

41:07.097 --> 41:08.359
Norman!

41:09.633 --> 41:11.897
Devon, I've been trying
to reach you.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.062
Nothing came over the
remote communication system.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.662
Have you seen Bonnie?

41:16.006 --> 41:18.133
Yes, she was over there.

41:19.877 --> 41:21.469
We've got to find her.

41:25.549 --> 41:27.483
I don't want to hurt you,
Bonnie.

41:27.551 --> 41:31.920
I just think you're so nice,
and you're so beautiful, Bonnie.

41:41.031 --> 41:42.555
Hello, Bonnie.

41:48.806 --> 41:51.707
Simon.
I hope I didn't frighten you.

41:51.842 --> 41:55.869
What are you doing in here? I thought
you were tied up with business.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.278
The remote communication
system is in here, Bonnie...

41:59.350 --> 42:01.147
and my business...

42:01.218 --> 42:02.276
is you.

42:03.954 --> 42:06.354
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

42:06.423 --> 42:08.618
Is this some sort of
a Halloween joke?

42:08.692 --> 42:11.354
You think I risked
all this for a joke?

42:11.729 --> 42:13.321
No, Bonnie, I want that key.

42:13.397 --> 42:15.661
What key?
What are you talking about?

42:27.044 --> 42:28.136
Norman!

42:30.014 --> 42:32.039
Where's Bonnie?
I didn't hurt her.

42:32.116 --> 42:33.845
I just wanted to tell her
how much I liked her.

42:33.918 --> 42:35.647
For heaven's sake, man,
where is she?

42:35.719 --> 42:38.745
She locked herself in one of
those rooms down that hallway.

42:38.822 --> 42:39.880
My office.

42:41.125 --> 42:43.457
This is what
it's all about, Bonnie.

42:43.527 --> 42:47.793
The key to Linda's safety deposit box.
It contains a very revealing videotape.

42:48.699 --> 42:49.893
Linda's key...

42:49.967 --> 42:50.956
You killed her!

42:51.035 --> 42:53.731
I had to. And now
I have to kill you, too.

43:04.148 --> 43:06.013
It was the money, wasn't it?

43:06.083 --> 43:08.779
Every month seeing a little
bit more of your inheritance...

43:08.852 --> 43:10.843
going to
your father's mistress.

43:11.455 --> 43:13.286
That money was mine.

43:19.296 --> 43:21.264
And you saw a way
to get it all, huh?

43:21.332 --> 43:24.199
Kill the mistress and frame
your father for murder.

43:26.870 --> 43:30.465
He should have retired a long time
ago. That business should be mine!

43:30.541 --> 43:34.534
I suppose Denise was next, huh? I
wonder how you planned to get rid of her.

43:34.845 --> 43:37.109
Your wondering days
are over, Knight.

43:49.593 --> 43:50.719
Let's go.

43:57.001 --> 43:59.367
KITT, pick me up
outside Devon's office.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.062
Where is he, KITT?

44:28.666 --> 44:30.600
He's headed
south on Jefferson.

44:30.834 --> 44:32.358
I want that guy.

44:56.260 --> 44:59.889
See? Fake city. I can't
believe we paid for this.

45:00.130 --> 45:01.529
Barry!

45:14.178 --> 45:15.440
There he is, KITT!

45:15.512 --> 45:17.241
Michael, those cars
are blocking our way.

45:17.314 --> 45:18.679
He's a murderer.

45:18.949 --> 45:20.849
I'm not gonna lose him now.

45:24.154 --> 45:27.180
Not now, Barry,
here comes the good part.

45:33.397 --> 45:35.365
Now that's gnarly!

46:11.034 --> 46:12.661
Show's over, Simon.

46:13.570 --> 46:14.935
Way to go, Rhett!

46:16.473 --> 46:17.838
Hey, Rhett!

46:37.161 --> 46:39.356
Glad you guys could make it.

46:40.998 --> 46:43.125
Bonnie, are you sure
you want company so soon?

46:43.200 --> 46:45.361
After all, you've hardly
had time to settle in.

46:45.435 --> 46:47.460
Company is exactly
what I want.

46:47.538 --> 46:50.871
In fact, I've even invited one of my
neighbors for you to meet, Michael.

46:50.941 --> 46:52.966
Uh-oh.
Jean.

46:55.179 --> 46:56.168
Jean?

46:56.914 --> 46:58.313
What ever happened
to Esmeralda?

46:58.382 --> 47:00.043
That was just for Halloween.

47:00.117 --> 47:03.450
You didn't really believe all that
nonsense about my being a witch, did you?

47:03.520 --> 47:06.512
You being a witch?
Come on, you gotta be kidding.

47:06.590 --> 47:08.217
Not for a minute.

47:10.127 --> 47:11.287
Shall we go upstairs?
Yes.

47:11.361 --> 47:13.921
I'm looking forward
to seeing your apartment.

47:14.298 --> 47:15.697
What's in the pot?

47:16.433 --> 47:17.422
Well?

47:18.602 --> 47:21.093
Michael,
you don't want to know.

47:36.987 --> 47:39.615
Keep an eye out for newts,
will you, pal?

47:53.270 --> 47:54.464
Michael.
