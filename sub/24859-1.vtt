01:16.257 --> 01:21.794
<i>There is a place
like no other on Earth.</i>

01:21.796 --> 01:24.897
<i>A land full of wonder,</i>

01:24.899 --> 01:26.365
<i>mystery,</i>

01:26.367 --> 01:27.637
<i>and danger.</i>

01:30.271 --> 01:33.873
<i>Some say to survive it,</i>

01:33.875 --> 01:37.910
<i>you need to be
as mad as a hatter,</i>

01:37.912 --> 01:40.746
<i>which luckily...</i>

01:40.748 --> 01:42.417
<i>I am.</i>

01:48.357 --> 01:51.391
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:51.393 --> 01:52.861
Easy, sweetheart.

01:58.399 --> 02:01.635
I don't think you're
supposed to smoke in here.

02:01.637 --> 02:03.370
Guess I've sinned
again then.

02:03.372 --> 02:05.941
What is it that you want?

02:12.414 --> 02:14.747
You know exactly what I want.

02:14.749 --> 02:19.385
I want your work,
your contracts, all of it.

02:19.387 --> 02:21.420
I'm afraid
you're out of luck.

02:21.422 --> 02:25.891
I've been recommended another
interested party to handle my...

02:25.893 --> 02:28.427
liquidations.

02:28.429 --> 02:31.298
I'll make you a wager.

02:31.300 --> 02:34.767
These other interested parties,

02:34.769 --> 02:38.372
I'll set them on one another
like starving rats in a cage,

02:38.374 --> 02:40.841
and you can
watch through the bars.

02:40.843 --> 02:42.376
Give me a fortnight.

02:42.378 --> 02:44.544
I'll have them both dead
at your feet.

02:44.546 --> 02:47.880
If I win, I get your work.

02:47.882 --> 02:49.283
All of it.

02:49.285 --> 02:51.852
If you win,

02:51.854 --> 02:55.521
you get to make me the
interested party that's dead.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.790
Deal?

02:57.792 --> 02:59.392
Deal.

02:59.394 --> 03:00.796
Wait.

03:02.530 --> 03:05.299
I need a little favor.

03:05.301 --> 03:08.404
I need you
to find someone for me.

04:37.425 --> 04:39.361
Let the games begin.

05:13.028 --> 05:15.728
Filet steaks and a robust red
for supper, is it?

05:15.730 --> 05:16.997
Fuck off, you punk.

05:16.999 --> 05:19.132
Don't do that.
It's dangerous.

05:19.134 --> 05:21.134
I've got an open blade here.

05:21.136 --> 05:23.905
Stick it in your mouth.
Maybe it will keep you quiet.

05:27.975 --> 05:29.776
Why are you shaving?

05:29.778 --> 05:31.177
Two weeks we've been in here
all day and all night,

05:31.179 --> 05:32.946
and suddenly
you're putting your face on.

05:32.948 --> 05:33.947
What's all that about?

05:33.949 --> 05:36.115
I've got a date later.

05:36.117 --> 05:38.951
Have you? Bollocks.

05:38.953 --> 05:41.822
Only date you've got is with
a camp bed and your right hand,

05:41.824 --> 05:43.759
you wanker.

06:24.633 --> 06:27.266
No trains till tomorrow now.

06:27.268 --> 06:29.235
404 going north,

06:29.237 --> 06:32.172
calling all stations
until termination.

06:32.174 --> 06:34.040
Have a pleasant trip.

06:34.042 --> 06:36.742
I'm not going north.
I just need a train.

06:36.744 --> 06:37.913
Train?

06:39.614 --> 06:41.113
- Yes.
- Where you going?

06:41.115 --> 06:42.949
Nowhere.
I just need a train.

06:42.951 --> 06:44.817
- Why?
- Never you mind!

06:44.819 --> 06:46.988
There's no need for rudeness.

06:50.792 --> 06:53.192
I'm so sorry.
That was, um...

06:53.194 --> 06:54.728
That was unnecessary.

06:54.730 --> 06:57.230
A man...

06:57.232 --> 06:58.798
who needs a train...

06:58.800 --> 07:01.600
but not the journey...

07:01.602 --> 07:04.036
is a man with a problem.

07:04.038 --> 07:05.704
Indeed.

07:05.706 --> 07:07.240
Are there any freight trains
coming through here

07:07.242 --> 07:09.576
- between now and then?
- Naw.

07:09.578 --> 07:11.011
No freight trains here.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.846
Of course.

07:12.848 --> 07:14.113
Yeah.

07:14.115 --> 07:16.682
404 going north,

07:16.684 --> 07:21.987
calling all stations
until termination.

07:21.989 --> 07:24.089
Well, the 404
seems like an age away,

07:24.091 --> 07:26.761
and it's not time
I'm trying to kill.

07:30.232 --> 07:32.865
End of the Line Cafe

07:32.867 --> 07:35.168
situated on
the station concourse,

07:35.170 --> 07:37.202
open 24 hours a day.

07:37.204 --> 07:41.273
Why not purchase one of
our delicious sticky buns?

07:41.275 --> 07:43.175
Only 30 pence.

07:43.177 --> 07:44.744
You're peculiar.

07:44.746 --> 07:47.613
And you're staring
at an empty platform

07:47.615 --> 07:51.184
in a deserted station
in the middle of the night,

07:51.186 --> 07:56.058
waiting for a train
that isn't coming.

07:57.292 --> 07:59.259
TouchÃ©.

07:59.261 --> 08:01.763
End of the Line it is.

08:27.254 --> 08:29.389
Give us your money,
you old bastard, or I'll do you!

08:29.391 --> 08:31.290
What? No! Absolutely not!

08:31.292 --> 08:33.393
- You think I'm kidding?
- I didn't say that.

08:33.395 --> 08:36.129
I just feel like
you lack preparation is all.

08:37.198 --> 08:38.731
How's this for preparation?

08:38.732 --> 08:42.268
Now give him your wallet
and your watch. Now!

08:42.270 --> 08:44.638
I'll tell you what.
I'll buy the gun off you.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.306
I've got a fiver here,
a crisp five pound note.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.907
Take it or leave it.

08:47.909 --> 08:49.908
Raymond, hurry up!

08:49.910 --> 08:51.144
What do you want me
to do, Lenny?

08:51.146 --> 08:53.379
- He's not cooperating.
- Lenny?

08:53.381 --> 08:55.048
- You are?
- Raymond.

08:55.050 --> 08:56.982
Raymond. Now listen to me
very, very carefully.

08:56.984 --> 08:59.351
I've made what I believe to be
a perfectly reasonable offer.

08:59.353 --> 09:01.254
Now you're going
to make a few quid,

09:01.256 --> 09:02.355
and I'm in need of a gun.

09:02.357 --> 09:03.990
Now, is it loaded?

09:03.992 --> 09:05.258
What do you mean,
is it loaded?

09:05.260 --> 09:07.126
I mean, are there
any bullets in it?

09:07.128 --> 09:09.162
Of course it's loaded!

09:09.164 --> 09:10.633
Really?

09:12.700 --> 09:13.899
No, it's not loaded.

09:13.901 --> 09:15.168
- Ah.
- Ray!

09:15.170 --> 09:16.870
- For Christ's sakes!
- What?

09:16.872 --> 09:17.903
It's not, is it?

09:17.905 --> 09:19.706
This is ridiculous.

09:19.708 --> 09:21.073
- Hey, where you going?
- Stay there you or I'll...

09:21.075 --> 09:22.442
Or what? What, Lenny?

09:22.444 --> 09:25.378
You going to butter me
to death?

09:25.380 --> 09:27.947
I'm very disappointed
in both of you.

09:27.949 --> 09:30.984
You've let me down,
and you've let yourselves down.

09:30.986 --> 09:33.219
Something to think about,
isn't it?

09:33.221 --> 09:34.657
Good night.

09:37.992 --> 09:39.926
Fucking piss me off sometimes,
you do.

09:39.928 --> 09:41.827
Why did you tell him
there were no bullets for?

10:06.987 --> 10:08.189
You can't smoke in here.

10:11.859 --> 10:13.826
Well, there's
no one else in here.

10:13.828 --> 10:16.495
They're not smoking either,
are they?

10:16.497 --> 10:21.267
Can I have another cup
of coffee then? This one's cold.

10:21.269 --> 10:24.336
That's because you've been
playing with it for 20 minutes.

10:24.338 --> 10:27.273
- Can I have another one?
- Sure. 40 pence.

10:27.275 --> 10:28.942
Have a heart.
I just got mugged.

10:28.944 --> 10:31.977
39 then.
I'm in a giving mood.

10:35.050 --> 10:37.185
So shines a good deed
in a naughty world.

10:38.453 --> 10:40.186
Naughty?

10:40.188 --> 10:43.123
As in spank me gently,
I've been a naughty girl?

10:43.125 --> 10:46.158
No, not that kind of naughty.

10:46.160 --> 10:49.262
As in tie me to the bedposts
because I've been so naughty?

10:49.264 --> 10:52.331
I think that qualifies
as the same kind of naughty.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.033
I know.

10:54.035 --> 10:57.740
I just enjoy watching you fidget
when I say "naughty."

10:59.875 --> 11:02.174
Have we met before?

11:02.176 --> 11:04.878
Why? Do I look familiar?

11:08.415 --> 11:10.917
Are you all right?

11:10.919 --> 11:13.186
Do you need your medicine?

11:13.188 --> 11:15.488
Well, tell me which one.

11:15.490 --> 11:17.322
You've got to be kidding me.

11:17.324 --> 11:19.458
Medicinal purposes.

11:19.460 --> 11:21.863
Nice. Go on then.

11:34.275 --> 11:35.844
How about that coffee?

11:51.126 --> 11:52.859
Listen to this.

11:52.861 --> 11:54.561
"Curvaceous,
cream-skinned belle

11:54.563 --> 11:57.529
seeks sleek Romeo
for candlelit romance

11:57.531 --> 11:59.566
and walks in the moonlight.

11:59.568 --> 12:02.000
City based."

12:02.002 --> 12:04.203
See, that's code, that is.

12:04.205 --> 12:06.908
That's deviants' code.
Pervert poetry.

12:08.309 --> 12:11.110
Translates to "Fat bird
wants outside seeing-to

12:11.112 --> 12:12.946
late at night." See?

12:12.948 --> 12:15.114
Well, that is funny.

12:15.116 --> 12:17.583
"Slight, retiring
young gentleman

12:17.585 --> 12:21.988
seeks decisive, practical lady
to draw him from his shell.

12:21.990 --> 12:25.490
Friendship and romance.
Suburban residence."

12:25.492 --> 12:27.360
Translation:

12:27.362 --> 12:29.461
Skinny pencil-dick
seeks dominatrix

12:29.463 --> 12:31.230
for abuse and humiliation.

12:31.232 --> 12:33.131
Has own dungeon.

12:33.133 --> 12:35.168
World's gone to shit,
and all anyone can think about

12:35.170 --> 12:39.272
is their next dirty one
down the docks.

12:39.274 --> 12:41.607
There it is, though.

12:41.609 --> 12:45.547
There it is
in black and white.

12:58.559 --> 13:00.626
So...

13:00.628 --> 13:02.895
what's wrong with you?

13:02.897 --> 13:04.464
I beg your pardon?

13:04.466 --> 13:07.166
You're hardly the picture
of health. What's wrong?

13:07.168 --> 13:08.567
You don't want to know.

13:08.569 --> 13:10.403
I'm fascinated.

13:10.405 --> 13:13.072
- Tell me.
- What's wrong with you?

13:13.074 --> 13:16.609
I have an unquenchable bloodlust
for darkness and depravity.

13:16.611 --> 13:18.577
That's nice.

13:18.579 --> 13:19.946
Is it cancer?

13:19.948 --> 13:22.447
No, no.

13:22.449 --> 13:26.052
Has anyone ever introduced you
to the concept of small talk?

13:26.054 --> 13:29.389
Well, what is it
if it's not cancer?

13:29.391 --> 13:31.190
They don't know.

13:31.192 --> 13:33.326
No way.

13:33.328 --> 13:35.294
That is brilliant.

13:35.296 --> 13:36.995
You're a bit odd, aren't you?

13:36.997 --> 13:39.599
Unquestionably, but death
is by far the best bit.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.634
- Of what?
- Of life!

13:41.636 --> 13:44.070
Did you read that
in a birthday card?

13:44.072 --> 13:45.607
You're funny.

13:47.107 --> 13:49.642
All right,
let's examine the facts.

13:49.644 --> 13:53.479
It's terminal, your sides hurt,
and you cough badly.

13:53.481 --> 13:55.380
All signs point to
malignant tumor damage.

13:55.382 --> 13:57.517
You're not in denial about it,
are you?

13:57.519 --> 14:01.220
You're not desperately searching
for another explanation?

14:01.222 --> 14:03.322
I'm dying?

14:03.324 --> 14:05.026
Yeah.

14:06.227 --> 14:08.327
No, thanks.

14:08.329 --> 14:12.667
But you don't know...
why or how?

14:14.401 --> 14:15.400
No.

14:15.402 --> 14:17.602
Will it be painful?

14:17.604 --> 14:19.404
Oh, no.

14:19.406 --> 14:23.109
Well, how can you be sure?

14:23.111 --> 14:24.476
Painkillers.

14:28.550 --> 14:30.082
Is there anything else?

14:32.520 --> 14:33.753
Lolly?

14:33.755 --> 14:36.221
It's definitely not cancer.

14:36.223 --> 14:38.591
Okay. I don't want to
waste my time diagnosing you

14:38.593 --> 14:40.592
if it's going to be some
run of the mill cancer thing.

14:40.594 --> 14:42.461
Who says I need diagnosing?

14:42.463 --> 14:44.029
You're dying.

14:44.031 --> 14:45.298
Painfully, apparently.

14:45.300 --> 14:48.100
And they don't know
why or what of.

14:48.102 --> 14:49.568
It just sounds
pretty undiagnosed to me.

14:49.570 --> 14:52.437
We're all dying, you realize.

14:52.439 --> 14:56.042
Slowly, painfully.
Just a matter of time, friend.

14:56.044 --> 14:58.644
See now, that's the spirit!

14:58.646 --> 15:00.178
Are you scared?

15:00.180 --> 15:02.381
I try not to think about it.

15:02.383 --> 15:03.615
How's that working out
for you?

15:03.617 --> 15:05.384
Not very well.

15:05.386 --> 15:06.753
Are you being survived?

15:06.755 --> 15:08.721
I have no idea
what that means.

15:08.723 --> 15:10.123
Wife, kids?

15:10.125 --> 15:11.256
Okay, you can't say that.

15:11.258 --> 15:12.591
It's "survived by."

15:12.593 --> 15:14.126
It has no other
grammatical context.

15:14.128 --> 15:16.361
Jesus, what are you,
a dying English teacher?

15:16.363 --> 15:17.663
Yeah.

15:17.665 --> 15:19.231
Oh.

15:19.233 --> 15:21.400
That's fair enough, I suppose.

15:21.402 --> 15:23.469
Conjugate me
to your heart's content.

15:23.471 --> 15:25.804
- Conjugation's different...
- Shut up.

15:25.806 --> 15:27.275
Okay.

15:34.049 --> 15:36.418
Are you sure
we haven't met before?

15:37.684 --> 15:40.385
I don't know. Have we?

15:40.387 --> 15:42.687
One shouldn't answer a question
with a question.

15:42.689 --> 15:46.192
One shouldn't be such
a pompous prat, but here we are.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.663
I think I would definitely
remember you if we'd met before.

15:50.665 --> 15:53.434
You would think so,
wouldn't you?

16:12.620 --> 16:14.790
What the fuck is going on?

16:16.657 --> 16:18.459
Who the hell are you?

16:20.462 --> 16:22.364
Untie me.

16:23.598 --> 16:24.730
Now!

16:28.469 --> 16:30.302
Listen to me.

16:30.304 --> 16:33.773
You've made a mistake.
A big one.

16:33.775 --> 16:38.677
But it is a redeemable error.

16:38.679 --> 16:40.379
You're gonna put on
the rest of your clothes,

16:40.381 --> 16:41.480
you're gonna
gather your things,

16:41.482 --> 16:43.548
you're gonna give me the key,

16:43.550 --> 16:48.221
and then you're going
to run for your life.

16:48.223 --> 16:51.657
You've no idea who I am,

16:51.659 --> 16:54.559
what I do,

16:54.561 --> 16:56.662
or who I work for.

16:56.664 --> 17:01.366
Au contraire,
Mr. Nigel Illing.

17:01.368 --> 17:04.170
I know exactly who you are.

17:04.172 --> 17:06.637
I know exactly
what it is you do.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.843
And I know exactly
who you work for.

17:11.346 --> 17:14.814
I also know that you're 44,
5'11", 12 stone,

17:14.816 --> 17:16.516
AB Negative,
a drinker and a smoker,

17:16.518 --> 17:17.817
and you have a healthy appetite

17:17.819 --> 17:20.122
for young hookers
in kinky suspenders.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.726
And when you combine
the information

17:26.728 --> 17:28.394
I have gathered on you
and your habits,

17:28.396 --> 17:31.230
one can deduce exactly
how many drops of laudanum

17:31.232 --> 17:32.899
it requires to render you
unconscious

17:32.901 --> 17:34.703
and relatively docile.

17:36.370 --> 17:40.306
I need a teeny-weeny bit
of information from you

17:40.308 --> 17:43.545
and a small donation.

17:44.878 --> 17:46.711
Okay, what do you want?

17:46.713 --> 17:48.446
You want money?

17:48.448 --> 17:51.851
You want the car?
Listen, you can take it.

17:51.853 --> 17:54.854
You can take it.
Take whatever you want.

17:54.856 --> 17:57.522
Oh, that's a very poor
choice of words.

17:57.524 --> 18:00.292
Help! Help!

18:00.294 --> 18:02.194
Help!

18:13.875 --> 18:17.246
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

18:22.383 --> 18:24.349
So there's this guy, right?

18:24.351 --> 18:25.917
He's creeping
through this house.

18:25.919 --> 18:28.788
It's dark, sinister, creepy.
You get the picture.

18:28.790 --> 18:30.256
Pulls out his gun,

18:30.258 --> 18:31.891
and he goes into the room
with it

18:31.893 --> 18:35.627
held arm's length
in front of him, Vince.

18:35.629 --> 18:37.565
I don't know what to tell you.
It's the pictures.

18:40.601 --> 18:42.667
Right. You walk
into the room, right?

18:42.669 --> 18:44.737
In like a shot.
You clear your corners.

18:44.739 --> 18:46.771
Cleared.
The room is yours, easy.

18:46.773 --> 18:49.842
You don't fucking ease
your gun into the room

18:49.844 --> 18:51.376
without being able
to see anything,

18:51.378 --> 18:53.378
waiting to be shot.

18:53.380 --> 18:54.880
It's stupid.

18:54.882 --> 18:57.549
It's a film, Alf.
It's make-believe.

18:57.551 --> 19:00.853
It's factually inaccurate.
They actually make it up.

19:00.855 --> 19:03.288
It's not as though they've got
some hit man consultant

19:03.290 --> 19:04.589
talking them through
the finer points

19:04.591 --> 19:06.592
of assassinating
other fictitious people.

19:06.594 --> 19:07.960
Yes, but why not?

19:07.962 --> 19:11.364
It would be factually accurate
if they did.

19:11.366 --> 19:12.431
I just realized something.

19:12.433 --> 19:14.634
You're a fucking moron.

19:14.636 --> 19:16.405
Two teas, love!

19:17.938 --> 19:19.675
Oy, bottle blonde!

19:21.376 --> 19:22.578
Two teas.

19:24.745 --> 19:26.447
What's the magic word?

19:31.586 --> 19:34.753
To be fair,
you didn't say "please."

19:34.755 --> 19:38.490
Please, could we have
two tea cups of lovely tea,

19:38.492 --> 19:41.326
a little bit of milk,
two sugars, both builder's,

19:41.328 --> 19:42.461
please, if you don't mind?

19:42.463 --> 19:43.898
Thank you very much.

19:45.332 --> 19:47.400
It will be my pleasure.

19:47.402 --> 19:48.337
Wanker.

19:49.671 --> 19:50.806
Watch this.

19:56.743 --> 20:00.346
Excuse me.
Could I have one of your...

20:00.348 --> 20:02.914
lovely-looking
sticky buns, please?

20:02.916 --> 20:05.584
It's dinner and drinks
at the very least

20:05.586 --> 20:08.354
before you get your hands
on my buns, handsome.

20:08.356 --> 20:11.324
I mix a mean martini,
sugarplum.

20:11.326 --> 20:13.358
In that case,
I'll even butter them for you.

20:13.360 --> 20:16.628
Alfred, would you mind terribly
rejoining me at the table,

20:16.630 --> 20:18.029
pretty please?

20:18.031 --> 20:20.665
Before I break
your fucking neck.

20:20.667 --> 20:21.933
Duty calls.

20:21.935 --> 20:24.272
On the job, are you?

20:28.076 --> 20:29.642
Is there the remotest chance

20:29.644 --> 20:33.078
that you could possibly
calm down a bit?

20:33.080 --> 20:34.980
And what kind of a shithole
is this then, eh?

20:34.982 --> 20:38.483
You said somewhere quiet,
off the beaten track.

20:38.485 --> 20:40.419
So you find the only
late night cafe

20:40.421 --> 20:41.753
open this side
of the precinct.

20:41.755 --> 20:43.422
It's genius.

20:43.424 --> 20:45.924
I thought it might be nice
if we had a cup of tea

20:45.926 --> 20:47.495
while we talked.

20:49.797 --> 20:51.466
Enjoy my buns.

20:56.604 --> 20:57.903
Are you fucking drunk
or something?

20:57.905 --> 20:59.672
<i>No. Why?</i>

20:59.674 --> 21:03.142
<i>Just shut the fuck up!
That's why.</i>

21:03.144 --> 21:05.678
<i>What is
so cloak and dagger</i>

21:05.680 --> 21:08.748
that you couldn't just
tell me over the phone?

21:08.750 --> 21:10.915
A job's coming.

21:10.917 --> 21:12.084
Yeah?

21:12.086 --> 21:13.986
Guttering, is it?
Window cleaning?

21:13.988 --> 21:15.755
Yeah, keep up the cheek, son.

21:15.757 --> 21:17.722
You know, you're gonna
get clipped round the ear.

21:17.724 --> 21:19.557
In fact,
you're gonna get a clip

21:19.559 --> 21:21.126
straight in
the fucking forehead.

21:21.128 --> 21:23.496
Understand?

21:23.498 --> 21:25.397
All right.

21:25.399 --> 21:26.932
I'm listening.

21:26.934 --> 21:30.905
So there's a message
on the answering service.

21:33.707 --> 21:36.808
<i>It tells me,
"Go to the terminal</i>

21:36.810 --> 21:39.380
<i>and open locker 125."</i>

21:47.053 --> 21:49.590
- <i>Is there a key?</i>
- <i>No, there's no key.</i>

21:51.125 --> 21:52.928
<i>So what was in it?</i>

22:10.811 --> 22:12.546
"La Lapin Blanche."

22:13.713 --> 22:15.114
What's that?

22:15.116 --> 22:16.816
Well, it's French.

22:16.818 --> 22:19.818
Yes, I know, thank you.

22:19.820 --> 22:22.020
I simply don't understand
the relevance of it.

22:22.022 --> 22:23.721
Are you going
to ruin this for me?

22:23.723 --> 22:26.791
Are you going to suck
all the fucking alluring mystery

22:26.793 --> 22:29.694
out of this fucking
situation for me?

22:29.696 --> 22:31.766
So it's a clue.

22:33.233 --> 22:36.167
- A trail of breadcrumbs.
- Yes, apparently.

22:36.169 --> 22:38.837
Someone has a <i>pen-chaunt</i>
for the amateur dramatics.

22:38.839 --> 22:40.472
It's pronounced <i>penchant.</i>

22:40.474 --> 22:41.973
It's pronounced
<i>shut your fucking mouth</i>

22:41.975 --> 22:46.511
is how it's pronounced.

22:46.513 --> 22:49.548
Hang on a second.

22:49.550 --> 22:50.749
Black briefcase.

22:50.751 --> 22:52.651
Mm-hmm.

22:52.653 --> 22:54.586
In a locker.

22:54.588 --> 22:56.654
A clue.
A trail of breadcrumbs.

22:56.656 --> 22:58.790
Vince, that's the touch, mate.

22:58.792 --> 23:01.096
That is a job
from Mr. Franklin.

23:03.563 --> 23:05.163
<i>A Mr. Franklin job?</i>

23:05.165 --> 23:07.499
This is massive!

23:07.501 --> 23:08.634
All right.

23:08.636 --> 23:11.005
<i>Don't get moist.</i>

23:12.874 --> 23:14.973
I thought
he always used Illing.

23:16.644 --> 23:17.846
Apparently not.

23:20.748 --> 23:22.080
Now, have I whet your appetite?

23:22.082 --> 23:23.249
I'm salivating.

23:23.251 --> 23:26.588
Let's go rabbit on him.

23:33.627 --> 23:36.295
We've got to play our cards
right on this one, Vincent.

23:36.297 --> 23:39.731
No one fucks
with Mr. Franklin.

23:39.733 --> 23:41.267
It is a once in a blue moon,

23:41.269 --> 23:44.236
once in a fucking lifetime
opportunity.

23:44.238 --> 23:45.804
It's keys to the kingdom.

23:45.806 --> 23:47.740
All right, Alfred,
it's Mr. Franklin,

23:47.742 --> 23:49.810
not the fucking second coming.

23:51.212 --> 23:53.878
Well, I guess
this is the place.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.713
What gave it away?

23:55.715 --> 24:00.920
Was it the 20-foot neon sign
with the fucking rabbit on it?

24:03.691 --> 24:05.790
Pinch me, I'm dreaming.

24:05.792 --> 24:08.961
I bet they charge
a good-priced cover.

24:30.818 --> 24:33.085
Hello, handsome,
dangerous men.

24:33.087 --> 24:34.819
Hello, beautiful,
semi-clad girl.

24:34.821 --> 24:37.021
Business or pleasure?

24:37.023 --> 24:39.357
Is the real question
do I want to pay you

24:39.359 --> 24:41.660
to writhe around on top of me
for a couple of songs,

24:41.662 --> 24:44.096
get me hot all under the collar
and take me into the back room

24:44.098 --> 24:46.030
for an overpriced hand job?

24:46.032 --> 24:47.365
'Cause if it is,
the answer's no, fuck off.

24:47.367 --> 24:49.768
You are no gentleman.

24:49.770 --> 24:51.639
But you, on the other hand...

24:53.107 --> 24:57.142
I'm Conejo. Welcome.
What is it you seek?

24:57.144 --> 24:58.943
We're here to meet someone.

24:58.945 --> 25:00.645
- Who?
- We don't know.

25:00.647 --> 25:02.280
About what?

25:02.282 --> 25:04.650
- We don't know.
- Oy!

25:04.652 --> 25:07.789
You need to see Bunny.
Follow me.

25:15.296 --> 25:18.096
So where's this Bunny then, eh?

25:18.098 --> 25:20.068
You'll see.

25:23.236 --> 25:24.769
Conejo.

25:24.771 --> 25:26.805
What a beautiful name.

25:26.807 --> 25:29.407
I bet it means "waterfall"
or "sunset"

25:29.409 --> 25:31.242
or something exotic like that.

25:31.244 --> 25:34.646
It means "rabbit," tit.

25:34.648 --> 25:36.147
Oh, yeah.

25:36.149 --> 25:37.650
Get your head
in the fucking game, mate.

25:37.652 --> 25:39.652
You're becoming
a fucking liability.

25:39.654 --> 25:42.221
And part of my job is to
dispose of fucking liabilities.

25:42.223 --> 25:43.888
What do you mean,
I've become a fucking liability?

25:43.890 --> 25:45.324
<i>It's Bunny!</i>

25:47.293 --> 25:50.028
- Shut up.
- We all play the game.

25:52.165 --> 25:54.199
Shut up. Look at her.

25:54.201 --> 25:57.368
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

26:10.251 --> 26:12.084
Yeah? I'll show you game.

26:12.086 --> 26:14.185
Yeah, are you
the famous Bunny?

26:14.187 --> 26:16.255
How abrupt.

26:16.257 --> 26:18.957
Well, I'm not here
for conversation or culture.

26:18.959 --> 26:20.425
I'm here for information.

26:20.427 --> 26:22.961
Maybe a filthy lap dance,
if I can get one.

26:22.963 --> 26:25.698
Then you're in
the right place, Vincent.

26:25.700 --> 26:28.269
How do you know my name?

26:30.070 --> 26:32.003
Bottle blonde!

26:32.005 --> 26:34.239
What the fucking hell
are you doing here?

26:34.241 --> 26:35.809
Girl's got to eat.

26:38.378 --> 26:40.378
Is there somewhere
we can go and talk?

26:40.380 --> 26:43.350
That depends.
Have you got something for me?

26:45.319 --> 26:48.155
I was thinking more of
an envelope stuffed with money.

26:57.764 --> 27:00.332
Now, I bet that's gonna buy me
a few filthy lap dances.

27:00.334 --> 27:02.134
Probably a lot more than that.

27:02.136 --> 27:03.367
Come and find out.

27:03.369 --> 27:06.340
Both of you,
down the rabbit hole.

27:07.474 --> 27:08.809
Curiouser and curiouser.

27:14.948 --> 27:17.117
They're with me, boys.

27:22.255 --> 27:23.955
We've been sent here...
we don't know why...

27:23.957 --> 27:25.289
to see you, apparently.

27:25.291 --> 27:26.892
You're supposed to
give us something,

27:26.894 --> 27:28.259
though why you couldn't
have given it to us

27:28.261 --> 27:30.962
at the pissin' cafe
is way beyond me.

27:30.964 --> 27:32.263
Then we leave.

27:32.265 --> 27:33.267
Sound like a plan?

27:35.502 --> 27:37.038
So.

27:38.305 --> 27:39.438
So?

27:39.440 --> 27:42.508
Look, I'm just the middleman.

27:42.510 --> 27:44.375
Think of me as
a half-naked waitress

27:44.377 --> 27:46.411
delivering goods
from one anonymous party

27:46.413 --> 27:48.814
to another anonymous party
for a fee.

27:48.816 --> 27:53.117
Or slightly less anonymous
in your case, Vincent.

27:53.119 --> 27:56.288
- What's the combination?
- No idea.

27:56.290 --> 27:58.390
Well, what good's a briefcase
if we ain't got the combination?

27:58.392 --> 28:00.061
No idea.

28:02.930 --> 28:05.400
Huh. Doesn't even need
a combination.

28:07.134 --> 28:09.201
Thank you, Miss Bunny.
We'll be on our way.

28:09.203 --> 28:11.170
Hang on.

28:11.172 --> 28:13.538
There's something different
about you, bottle blonde.

28:13.540 --> 28:16.174
Besides my stocking suspenders,
plunging cleavage,

28:16.176 --> 28:18.076
and full face
of harlot's makeup?

28:19.280 --> 28:21.579
Yeah, yeah, besides that.

28:21.581 --> 28:23.984
Time to go, Vince.

28:25.152 --> 28:26.818
No.

28:26.820 --> 28:29.988
I want my lap dance first
before I go anywhere.

28:31.291 --> 28:33.925
I'm ready if you are.

28:33.927 --> 28:35.928
I'll let the dog
see the rabbit.

28:35.930 --> 28:38.933
<i>Let's go, Vince.
Floor show's over.</i>

28:42.970 --> 28:45.106
Let me show you chaps
the quick way out, shall I?

28:51.044 --> 28:54.479
I'm gonna get that filthy lap
dance off of you, bottle blonde,

28:54.481 --> 28:56.818
one way or another.

29:02.889 --> 29:05.092
Come back again soon, handsome.

29:06.559 --> 29:08.326
Alfred?

29:08.328 --> 29:10.531
I'll even show you my tail.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.368
Don't bring him.

29:20.607 --> 29:22.109
Wow.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.544
Oh, Jesus Christ.

29:25.546 --> 29:29.080
One sniff of a whore's perfume,
you think you're in love.

29:29.082 --> 29:30.548
I mean wow.

29:31.952 --> 29:34.122
She looked better
as a waitress.

29:36.190 --> 29:37.588
Wow!

29:37.590 --> 29:40.525
You really are a twat,
you know that?

29:47.367 --> 29:49.667
It's the waiting
that's doing me in.

29:49.669 --> 29:52.403
Just, um...

29:52.405 --> 29:56.407
sitting around,
waiting to stop breathing.

29:56.409 --> 29:58.846
My mom went in a house fire.

30:00.079 --> 30:02.213
No waiting around there,
I suppose.

30:02.215 --> 30:04.082
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

30:04.084 --> 30:06.451
You are utterly self-involved
at the moment,

30:06.453 --> 30:08.220
completely wrapped up
in yourself.

30:08.222 --> 30:10.221
Steady on.
Just 'cause I'm on my way out

30:10.223 --> 30:12.324
doesn't mean I've turned
into a complete bastard.

30:12.326 --> 30:13.991
Why not?

30:13.993 --> 30:15.559
It's your prerogative.

30:15.561 --> 30:17.362
That is your hard-won
silver lining.

30:17.364 --> 30:18.529
I don't follow.

30:18.531 --> 30:20.464
Okay, well, think of it
this way.

30:20.466 --> 30:22.034
It's moral carte blanche.

30:22.036 --> 30:24.036
It's an open invitation
to anarchy.

30:24.038 --> 30:26.672
You can spend
your last days on Earth

30:26.674 --> 30:28.573
doing whatever you want.

30:28.575 --> 30:29.942
Rape away.

30:29.944 --> 30:31.676
Smite to your heart's content.

30:31.678 --> 30:33.511
Pillage the precinct
till the gutters run red,

30:33.513 --> 30:34.980
and none of it will matter

30:34.982 --> 30:37.182
because you'll be dead
by Sunday.

30:37.184 --> 30:38.683
So go nuts!

30:38.685 --> 30:43.124
You know, dry roasted,
sniper in the clock tower nuts.

30:44.590 --> 30:47.092
Did something happen to you
as a child?

30:47.094 --> 30:49.126
Besides my mother dying in agony
in a blazing inferno?

30:49.128 --> 30:51.430
Oh, I am so sorry.
That was...

30:51.432 --> 30:54.499
Don't apologize.
Rub my nose in it.

30:54.501 --> 30:55.733
Come on, pillage me!

30:55.735 --> 30:58.338
Sorry. Was that a bit naughty?

31:00.573 --> 31:03.010
What happened to your thumb?

31:04.377 --> 31:05.346
Oh, that.

31:06.413 --> 31:08.680
An exercise in self-control.

31:08.682 --> 31:11.249
Ah. It went well then.

31:13.721 --> 31:15.619
Look, all I'm saying is

31:15.621 --> 31:18.390
this seems like
a really good opportunity

31:18.392 --> 31:20.192
to do whatever
the hell you want.

31:20.194 --> 31:23.194
Well, what if I want to
mope around in all-night cafes,

31:23.196 --> 31:25.196
feeling sorry for myself?

31:25.198 --> 31:27.365
Then, frankly,
I might as well do you in now

31:27.367 --> 31:29.768
and save myself from
your self-indulgent tripe.

31:32.438 --> 31:33.704
Well...

31:33.706 --> 31:36.141
Well, I would appreciate that.

31:36.143 --> 31:38.042
Annie.

31:38.044 --> 31:39.179
Bill.

31:49.623 --> 31:51.690
That's not your locker!

31:51.692 --> 31:53.692
You're going to give me
a fucking heart attack!

31:53.694 --> 31:56.294
It is a criminal offense
to interfere with

31:56.296 --> 31:59.397
either municipal storage
or precinct property.

31:59.399 --> 32:02.099
Any suspicious activity
must be reported

32:02.101 --> 32:04.504
to the appropriate
authorities immediately.

32:08.308 --> 32:10.575
Why don't you piss off,
old man?

32:10.577 --> 32:13.345
Mind your own business.

32:13.347 --> 32:16.213
Supervisor.
Night Supervisor.

32:16.215 --> 32:18.316
Duties to include sweeping
of concourse and platform,

32:18.318 --> 32:19.683
maintenance
and attendance of all...

32:19.685 --> 32:20.687
Shut up!

32:22.755 --> 32:24.355
Tell me something.

32:24.357 --> 32:27.425
Do I look to you like
the sort of individual

32:27.427 --> 32:29.728
that creeps into the station
in the dead of night,

32:29.730 --> 32:31.229
breaks open a locker,

32:31.231 --> 32:33.298
removes a suspicious-looking
briefcase,

32:33.300 --> 32:36.703
and then lets
the fucking cleaner...

32:39.505 --> 32:42.339
sorry, night supervisor...

32:42.341 --> 32:44.776
run off and tell tall tales
about it?

32:44.778 --> 32:46.510
Do I not strike you
more as the sort of

32:46.512 --> 32:49.614
highly motivated,
highly vicious individual

32:49.616 --> 32:52.550
that would not kill
said night supervisor

32:52.552 --> 32:55.086
and stuff him
into the fucking locker?

32:55.088 --> 32:58.789
Acceptable forms of payment
at the terminal are as follows:

32:58.791 --> 33:01.226
cash, banker's drafts,

33:01.228 --> 33:04.298
certified checks up to the
value of the return journey.

33:11.437 --> 33:14.506
I like you. You're funny.

33:14.508 --> 33:17.174
All right, all right,
I'll clear it.

33:17.176 --> 33:19.376
- Oh.
- Mum's the word, Supe.

33:19.378 --> 33:20.545
Okay.

33:20.547 --> 33:24.115
- Oh!
- Ten, twenty, thirty.

33:24.117 --> 33:26.053
We all right, son?

33:28.789 --> 33:32.891
When rich villains
have need of poor ones,

33:32.893 --> 33:36.431
poor ones make
what price they will.

33:39.465 --> 33:40.664
Come again?

33:40.666 --> 33:43.234
I want more money.

33:43.236 --> 33:45.269
Yeah.

33:45.271 --> 33:47.207
Oh, yeah.

33:48.774 --> 33:51.576
You know, when rich villains
get pissed off

33:51.578 --> 33:53.545
with poor ones
overcharging them,

33:53.547 --> 33:55.547
they go round their house,

33:55.549 --> 33:58.853
they burn it,
they murder their family.

34:00.753 --> 34:05.190
Terminal Train Lines
thanks you for your business

34:05.192 --> 34:08.463
and wishes you
a pleasant evening.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.405
What a fucking crook!

34:32.553 --> 34:35.485
- Yo, you better give me your...
- Fuck off!

34:35.487 --> 34:36.955
I just wanted to know
the time, mate.

34:36.956 --> 34:38.322
My bad.

34:38.324 --> 34:39.623
Yeah, that's it,
fucking walk on.

34:39.626 --> 34:41.725
Yeah, yeah, you better run.

34:41.726 --> 34:43.196
Dickhead.

34:47.434 --> 34:49.301
- Just for you.
- Thanks.

34:50.370 --> 34:52.937
Evening, bottle blonde.

34:52.938 --> 34:54.672
Hello, Prince Charming.

34:54.675 --> 34:57.475
- Alfred.
- Vince.

34:57.477 --> 34:59.377
You want to put her down, mate.

34:59.379 --> 35:02.316
You don't know where she's been.
You'll catch something.

35:03.417 --> 35:05.283
Duty calls.

35:05.285 --> 35:08.222
Well, it was lovely
seeing you again, handsome.

35:15.528 --> 35:17.597
Can't say the same
for you, Vincent.

35:20.734 --> 35:22.734
You want to get your head
in the game, mate?

35:22.736 --> 35:24.539
You're getting sloppy.

35:25.906 --> 35:27.504
I'll see you around,
bottle blonde,

35:27.506 --> 35:29.006
if I don't shoot you first.

35:29.008 --> 35:30.977
Ooh.

35:34.847 --> 35:35.882
Vince!

35:39.419 --> 35:40.655
Bang.

35:43.923 --> 35:45.756
Wanker.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.341
This was in the briefcase.

36:03.343 --> 36:07.448
Press play.
I'm gonna stretch my legs.

36:11.852 --> 36:14.451
<i>I am Mr. Franklin.</i>

36:14.453 --> 36:17.055
<i>I have no doubt
you know who I am</i>

36:17.057 --> 36:19.723
<i>and what my business is worth.</i>

36:19.725 --> 36:22.926
<i>I have an offer, a contract.</i>

36:22.928 --> 36:26.698
<i>I want you
to kill someone for me.</i>

36:26.700 --> 36:28.433
<i>You will lie in wait
in the apartment</i>

36:28.435 --> 36:31.535
<i>I have provided for you.</i>

36:31.537 --> 36:34.805
<i>You will be on call
24 hours a day,</i>

36:34.807 --> 36:36.875
<i>seven days a week,</i>

36:36.877 --> 36:39.944
<i>until I contact you to...</i>

36:39.946 --> 36:41.845
<i>execute.</i>

36:41.847 --> 36:43.381
Jesus.

36:43.383 --> 36:44.948
<i>Before you commence,</i>

36:44.950 --> 36:48.653
<i>I require one of you to
attend a face-to-face meeting.</i>

36:48.655 --> 36:52.424
<i>Only one.
I do not like crowds.</i>

36:52.426 --> 36:54.325
<i>That is all.</i>

36:54.327 --> 36:56.630
Fucking perfect.

37:25.124 --> 37:27.661
Evening, bottle blonde.

37:30.731 --> 37:33.401
Out for a casual stroll?

38:18.812 --> 38:21.382
Well, for fuck's sake.

38:25.118 --> 38:27.752
You know what?
I'm getting a little bit old

38:27.754 --> 38:30.725
for all these parlor games,
bottle blonde.

38:54.580 --> 38:57.549
Evening, gorgeous.

38:57.551 --> 38:59.053
These are for you.

39:00.821 --> 39:03.154
You're in trouble, Alfred.

39:03.156 --> 39:05.022
I'm always in trouble,
sugarplum.

39:05.024 --> 39:07.691
Spare me the heroics.
You're in real trouble.

39:07.693 --> 39:09.060
Targeted,
shot in the back of the head

39:09.062 --> 39:10.928
unless you pay attention
trouble.

39:10.930 --> 39:12.897
I'm listening.

39:12.899 --> 39:16.133
Good, because I like you.

39:16.135 --> 39:18.937
You're handsome,
and you're chivalrous,

39:18.939 --> 39:20.537
and I like your jaw.

39:20.539 --> 39:22.707
It's manly.

39:22.709 --> 39:24.875
I want to keep you.

39:24.877 --> 39:27.180
- Well, I think you're...
- Shut up.

39:28.247 --> 39:30.048
Understood.

39:30.050 --> 39:32.750
There's someone here to see you.

39:32.752 --> 39:35.553
Listen to what he's got to say
or that handsome face of yours

39:35.555 --> 39:39.189
will have a gaping exit wound
slap bang in the middle of it.

39:39.191 --> 39:41.558
- Okay.
- Good.

39:41.560 --> 39:43.897
Come on out.
He's not gonna bite.

39:48.234 --> 39:50.100
Hello?

40:16.729 --> 40:18.196
<i>Good evening, Vincent.</i>

40:18.198 --> 40:20.665
Mr. fucking Franklin,
I presume.

40:20.667 --> 40:23.100
- <i>The very same.</i>
- Let me get this straight.

40:23.102 --> 40:24.636
You drag me out
in the middle of the night,

40:24.638 --> 40:27.037
halfway across the city,
freezing cold,

40:27.039 --> 40:29.140
up 20 flights of rickety stairs

40:29.142 --> 40:31.609
just so that you can speak to me
on the fucking phone?

40:31.611 --> 40:34.578
<i>Who says mystery's a lost art?</i>

40:34.580 --> 40:36.046
Yeah, fair enough.

40:36.048 --> 40:38.249
<i>Now, the contract.</i>

40:38.251 --> 40:40.919
<i>You and your partner
start tomorrow.</i>

40:40.921 --> 40:43.687
<i>The target will be
lured to this window.</i>

40:43.689 --> 40:46.823
<i>It faces the apartment
where you will be waiting.</i>

40:46.825 --> 40:48.959
<i>One shot to the head.</i>

40:48.961 --> 40:51.796
<i>A clean kill. No mistakes.</i>

40:51.798 --> 40:57.134
<i>Now, I have another deal,
a side part, for you.</i>

40:57.136 --> 40:59.136
<i>Okay, go on.</i>

40:59.138 --> 41:01.138
<i>When you've
executed the contract,</i>

41:01.140 --> 41:05.642
<i>I want you
to kill your partner.</i>

41:05.644 --> 41:07.044
Why?

41:07.046 --> 41:08.580
<i>I don't like crowds.</i>

41:08.582 --> 41:12.649
<i>And I like loyalty I can buy.</i>

41:12.651 --> 41:16.022
<i>Double the original offer,
in cash.</i>

41:18.925 --> 41:22.026
What you want,
his head on a silver platter?

41:22.028 --> 41:25.997
<i>His ID papers and
trigger finger will suffice.</i>

41:25.999 --> 41:29.801
<i>I'm offering you double
the money and a one way split.</i>

41:29.803 --> 41:34.037
<i>I believe I can trust
your mercenary greed.</i>

41:34.039 --> 41:36.943
<i>Now, do we have a deal?</i>

41:38.845 --> 41:40.211
Yeah.

41:40.213 --> 41:41.912
Consider it done.

41:41.914 --> 41:44.017
<i>Good.</i>

41:48.722 --> 41:50.787
Where'd you get ahold
of that there thing?

41:50.789 --> 41:53.091
Where the fuck
did you get that?

41:53.093 --> 41:55.093
Stop it, Alfred.
He's just the messenger.

41:55.095 --> 41:57.694
Who is about to get very shot
on the count of three.

41:57.696 --> 41:59.997
One, two...

41:59.999 --> 42:02.933
Locker!
Locker in the terminal!

42:02.935 --> 42:05.035
Black briefcase.

42:05.037 --> 42:06.104
Note inside.

42:06.106 --> 42:08.071
A man...
A man paid me.

42:08.073 --> 42:10.908
An envelope with money.

42:10.910 --> 42:12.176
Please don't kill me!

42:12.178 --> 42:14.013
Three.

42:17.182 --> 42:19.750
Now fuck off.

42:19.752 --> 42:21.220
Go on.

42:25.691 --> 42:27.193
Fuck!

42:29.896 --> 42:33.698
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

42:33.700 --> 42:35.700
Fucker!

42:38.238 --> 42:40.171
Feel better?

42:42.876 --> 42:45.843
It's all bullshit, isn't it?

42:45.845 --> 42:48.379
No job, no hit.

42:48.381 --> 42:50.250
Oh, no, handsome.

42:52.285 --> 42:55.388
There most definitely was a hit.

42:57.856 --> 42:59.022
Me?

42:59.024 --> 43:00.792
Not anymore.

43:00.794 --> 43:03.129
We can find a new target.

43:04.897 --> 43:06.296
We?

43:06.298 --> 43:09.200
Now tell me something,
sugarplum.

43:09.202 --> 43:12.837
Why should I trust you, eh?

43:12.839 --> 43:16.207
Aren't you part of
this whole conspiracy?

43:16.209 --> 43:18.879
I told you.

43:19.946 --> 43:22.279
I like you.

43:22.281 --> 43:25.151
I need someone
to butter my buns for.

43:32.425 --> 43:35.826
Well, I suppose I do need
a new partner now, don't I?

43:35.828 --> 43:40.464
My old one seems to have
become rather untrustworthy.

43:40.466 --> 43:42.433
But I will warn you, Alfred.

43:42.435 --> 43:45.870
I'll need a firm hand and a
regular lash of the tongue.

43:45.872 --> 43:49.272
I can't wait
to have you under me.

43:49.274 --> 43:51.008
Good.

43:51.010 --> 43:54.078
Let's have a cup of tea
and plot our bloody revenge.

43:54.080 --> 43:58.482
You tidy that up.
I'll put the kettle on...

43:58.484 --> 43:59.919
partner.

44:10.196 --> 44:13.897
The way I see it,
you've got two options.

44:13.899 --> 44:14.932
Go on.

44:14.934 --> 44:16.834
Option A: suicide.

44:16.836 --> 44:18.502
I see. And B?

44:18.504 --> 44:21.037
Well, you've got to hear
the case for Option A first.

44:21.039 --> 44:23.207
- I do?
- You do.

44:23.209 --> 44:24.475
I'm all ears.

44:24.477 --> 44:26.310
- You're dying.
- Apparently.

44:26.312 --> 44:28.912
- You're not happy about it.
- Not really.

44:28.914 --> 44:30.413
You're miserable, touchy.

44:30.415 --> 44:32.783
Quite frankly,
not great company.

44:32.785 --> 44:34.051
Oh, thank you.

44:34.053 --> 44:35.553
Want my advice?

44:35.555 --> 44:36.890
No.

44:38.857 --> 44:40.558
Just end it.

44:40.560 --> 44:43.361
Have you ever considered
counseling?

44:43.363 --> 44:45.062
Every minute of every day,

44:45.064 --> 44:46.830
you're bombarded with
a series of hazardous

44:46.832 --> 44:49.566
and potentially life-ending
situations to choose from.

44:49.568 --> 44:51.569
Jump in front of a bus.

44:51.571 --> 44:53.136
Have a bath with your toaster.

44:53.138 --> 44:54.504
Fall on your butter knife.

44:54.506 --> 44:56.506
Tall buildings,
rivers, bridges, trains.

44:56.508 --> 44:58.142
There are more ways
to end your life

44:58.144 --> 45:00.410
than there are ways to live it.

45:00.412 --> 45:02.412
All this pissing around
in train stations

45:02.414 --> 45:04.048
in the middle of the night
would be over.

45:04.050 --> 45:07.484
End this nothing,
and all it takes is some balls.

45:07.486 --> 45:10.187
And my immortal soul?

45:10.189 --> 45:11.923
Overrated.

45:11.925 --> 45:14.457
Overrated?

45:14.459 --> 45:19.800
Have you done something to put
your immortal soul in jeopardy?

45:24.604 --> 45:28.939
Well, there you go then.
Nothing to worry about.

45:28.941 --> 45:30.174
Are you Catholic?

45:30.176 --> 45:31.375
Yeah.

45:33.580 --> 45:35.412
Religious?

45:37.584 --> 45:40.984
Oh, fuck me.
Oh, sorry. Um...

45:40.986 --> 45:43.486
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

45:43.488 --> 45:45.923
To be honest, I can't recall
the last time I took confession.

45:45.925 --> 45:49.926
I think it's more than 10,
but less than 20.

45:49.928 --> 45:51.194
Days?

45:51.196 --> 45:55.265
Months?
Not years, surely.

45:55.267 --> 45:57.000
Don't get pissed off at me
for telling you the truth.

45:57.002 --> 45:58.970
That's just mean.

45:58.972 --> 46:01.104
If I'd known you were like this,
I would've just said three days

46:01.106 --> 46:03.441
and taken my chances
with the Almighty.

46:03.443 --> 46:05.278
Sorry.

46:06.613 --> 46:09.082
That was uncalled for.
I apologize.

46:11.251 --> 46:13.484
Are you still there?

46:15.120 --> 46:17.955
I know you're there.
I can smell sherry.

46:19.158 --> 46:20.558
Define religious.

46:20.560 --> 46:21.995
Lolly?

46:23.562 --> 46:26.464
I'll take that
as a big fat no.

46:26.466 --> 46:28.933
Maybe it's divine retribution.

46:28.935 --> 46:31.602
Oh, yeah, that sounds tasty.

46:31.604 --> 46:34.604
You know,
my sins revisiting me

46:34.606 --> 46:37.375
and my past
coming back to haunt me...

46:37.377 --> 46:40.977
I'm all ears, William.

46:40.979 --> 46:43.050
Let me hear your confession.

46:51.457 --> 46:53.993
Repent and thou shalt be saved!

46:55.528 --> 46:57.194
That's not even from the Bible.

46:57.196 --> 46:59.062
Okay, that is the graffiti

46:59.064 --> 47:01.933
that's written on the bus stop
opposite the terminal.

47:01.935 --> 47:03.500
That's disappointing.

47:03.502 --> 47:06.002
That's pretty much my entire
knowledge of scripture.

47:06.004 --> 47:08.038
Try this one:
Repent, turn back,

47:08.040 --> 47:10.374
and thy sins
will be blotted out.

47:10.376 --> 47:12.209
Not really as catchy, is it?

47:14.046 --> 47:15.680
How's my case
for suicide progressing?

47:15.682 --> 47:17.214
Am I quaking your foundations?

47:17.216 --> 47:19.116
You're giving me a headache.

47:19.118 --> 47:21.118
Oh, how's this for a headache?

47:21.120 --> 47:23.687
Take a pencil,
jam into tabletop,

47:23.689 --> 47:27.024
slam head down onto pencil,
dead in five seconds.

47:27.026 --> 47:28.725
- That's foul.
- Isn't it?

47:28.727 --> 47:30.261
And every time
I suggest this to someone,

47:30.263 --> 47:31.729
they think it goes
up your nose.

47:31.731 --> 47:33.497
You've suggested this
more than once?

47:33.499 --> 47:35.499
It can't go up your nose.
That's impossible.

47:35.501 --> 47:37.468
Think about
the trajectory involved.

47:37.470 --> 47:39.102
It would go in your eyeball,
right?

47:39.104 --> 47:40.738
Through the socket,
into your brain.

47:40.740 --> 47:44.441
I... Well, it depends on the
angle of the head, I suppose.

47:44.443 --> 47:46.142
Let's test the theory.

47:46.144 --> 47:49.013
It's not very sharp, is it?

47:49.015 --> 47:50.117
Use your fancy pen then.

47:52.452 --> 47:53.517
It's heavier.

47:53.519 --> 47:56.419
Nib's sharper than yours.

47:56.421 --> 47:59.458
Probably get it further into
the table, better purchase.

48:01.127 --> 48:03.194
It would feel more proper,
wouldn't it?

48:03.196 --> 48:04.562
More ceremonial.

48:04.564 --> 48:08.064
A pen does have more purpose
than a pencil.

48:08.066 --> 48:09.232
More stature.

48:09.234 --> 48:10.700
Definitely a better choice.

48:10.702 --> 48:13.671
Definitely,
and how resonantly poetic.

48:13.673 --> 48:17.040
The English professor found
impaled on his own fountain pen.

48:17.042 --> 48:18.042
It's epic.

48:18.044 --> 48:19.075
It's inspired.

48:19.077 --> 48:20.410
We've cracked it!

48:20.412 --> 48:24.080
Time, place, method,
it's all there.

48:24.082 --> 48:26.082
Don't you think
it'd be a bit painful?

48:26.084 --> 48:27.584
You're missing the point.

48:27.586 --> 48:29.053
Hmm?

48:29.055 --> 48:30.620
Get it?

48:30.622 --> 48:32.790
- Brilliant.
- God, you're not very keen.

48:32.792 --> 48:34.524
Do you want to
kill yourself or not?

48:34.526 --> 48:35.725
I'm not so sure now.

48:35.727 --> 48:37.660
Oh, pathetic.

48:37.662 --> 48:39.662
Can I have that pen then?
I never had one like that.

48:39.664 --> 48:41.232
- No.
- Why?

48:41.234 --> 48:43.566
Because it's mine.

48:43.568 --> 48:45.201
Thought you were
about to top yourself?

48:45.203 --> 48:46.736
What do you need a pen for?

48:46.738 --> 48:48.705
Come on, please. It'll be
like you left it for me.

48:48.707 --> 48:50.540
- Bequeathed it, not left.
- Oh, my God.

48:50.542 --> 48:52.308
Shut up!
I'm taking the pen.

48:52.310 --> 48:54.278
You've got no use for it,
and I want it.

48:54.280 --> 48:56.446
Here, you can have my pencil
to make up for your loss, okay?

48:56.448 --> 48:58.551
Done, swapped, over.

49:20.106 --> 49:22.709
<i>How long have
we been stuck in here?</i>

49:24.843 --> 49:29.145
<i>12 days, 13 hours,
and 27 minutes. Why?</i>

49:29.147 --> 49:30.714
<i>Just wondering.</i>

49:30.716 --> 49:32.383
<i>You missing
your bottle blonde?</i>

49:32.385 --> 49:34.852
Geez, you're like
a hormonal teenager.

49:34.854 --> 49:37.654
She's gonna be the death of you,
that fucking girl.

49:37.656 --> 49:39.823
- Cards.
- Yeah?

49:39.825 --> 49:42.493
- Great. Hold 'em.
- Three-card brag.

49:42.495 --> 49:44.361
Fuck off.
That's a pouf's game.

49:44.363 --> 49:46.162
Fine. Hold 'em it is.

49:46.164 --> 49:47.865
Fair enough. Let's go!

49:47.867 --> 49:49.466
That's more like it.

49:49.468 --> 49:51.102
Oh, give 'em here.

49:51.104 --> 49:52.368
You're gonna fucking
hurt yourself. Come on.

49:52.370 --> 49:53.807
Just give 'em to me.

49:55.774 --> 49:57.274
For fuck's sake, Alf.

49:57.276 --> 49:59.745
There's fucking
barely half a deck.

50:03.515 --> 50:05.316
We could always play snap.

50:05.318 --> 50:07.620
I'll snap your fucking neck
in a minute!

50:09.856 --> 50:12.689
How do you play solitaire?

50:12.691 --> 50:16.560
Quietly, on your own,
in the other fucking room.

50:16.562 --> 50:19.162
- You really are becoming a...
- Yeah, a fucking liability.

50:19.164 --> 50:21.067
I know. Hear it all the time.

50:26.772 --> 50:29.540
Boss, look at this.

50:29.542 --> 50:30.841
What is it?

50:30.843 --> 50:32.609
Something for me
to beat you to death with?

50:32.611 --> 50:33.680
No.

50:35.680 --> 50:39.250
"The time has come,
the walrus said,

50:39.252 --> 50:40.850
to talk of many things.

50:40.852 --> 50:45.622
<i>Of shoes
and ships and sealing wax,</i>

50:45.624 --> 50:47.658
of cabbages and kings."

50:47.660 --> 50:52.165
"And why the sea is boiling hot
and whether pigs have wings."

50:53.499 --> 50:54.832
I don't get it.

50:54.834 --> 50:57.167
It's gibberish.

50:57.169 --> 50:59.470
It's all like this,
the whole bloody book.

50:59.472 --> 51:01.337
It's just fucking drivel.

51:01.339 --> 51:04.375
Well, I'm sure Lewis Carroll
will be suitably apologetic

51:04.377 --> 51:07.544
when he finds out
how upset you are.

51:07.546 --> 51:09.647
Why don't you fuck off
into the other room

51:09.649 --> 51:11.818
and leave me alone, eh?

51:31.336 --> 51:33.370
Want a drink?

51:33.372 --> 51:35.272
A proper drink, I mean.

51:35.274 --> 51:37.144
Oh, no doubt.

51:40.946 --> 51:43.714
Bill, it's time
we explore Option B.

51:43.716 --> 51:44.982
Oh, goody, there's more.

51:44.984 --> 51:46.250
There is.

51:46.252 --> 51:49.720
Option B: assisted suicide.

51:50.957 --> 51:53.424
I believe they call that
"euthanasia."

51:53.426 --> 51:54.758
Eutha-what?

51:54.760 --> 51:57.595
It was very popular at one time
with the Swiss.

51:57.597 --> 51:58.629
What's a Swiss?

52:00.499 --> 52:01.999
Doesn't matter.

52:02.001 --> 52:03.767
All I'm saying is,

52:03.769 --> 52:06.236
if you haven't got the peanuts
to do it yourself,

52:06.238 --> 52:08.238
just get someone
to do it for you.

52:08.240 --> 52:10.307
Are you saying I take
a contract out on myself?

52:10.309 --> 52:12.008
Exactly.

52:12.010 --> 52:14.444
Do they have an assassins
section in the classifieds?

52:14.446 --> 52:16.680
"Wanted: tall, dark,
anonymous stranger.

52:16.682 --> 52:18.249
Must have own rifle."

52:18.251 --> 52:19.649
My new boyfriend's
a contract killer.

52:23.256 --> 52:24.955
And, talk about
getting lucky,

52:24.957 --> 52:26.357
he's getting off
a job today.

52:26.359 --> 52:27.924
Serendipity, indeed.

52:27.926 --> 52:29.859
We could give him
a brief, you know,

52:29.861 --> 52:31.962
suggest a few ways
you wouldn't mind being killed,

52:31.964 --> 52:34.365
let him pick the best one.

52:34.367 --> 52:36.267
Try this on for size.

52:36.269 --> 52:39.303
You're just going about your
daily business, then one day,

52:39.305 --> 52:41.473
you're on your way home from
a long day in the classroom...

52:42.607 --> 52:44.741
Shot in the head.

52:44.743 --> 52:46.709
Last thing
you would've expected.

52:46.711 --> 52:49.479
I think it's safe to say
if I'd paid somebody to kill me,

52:49.481 --> 52:52.616
I'd be expecting to be killed
most of the time.

52:52.618 --> 52:55.551
You just have to, you know,
try not to think about it.

52:55.553 --> 52:57.854
- Oh, okay, I'll do that then.
- Right.

52:57.856 --> 52:59.689
Can we bank long distance
head shots then?

52:59.691 --> 53:01.825
Quick, anonymous, painless.

53:01.827 --> 53:03.426
- Sounds like a keeper.
- Great.

53:03.428 --> 53:04.895
Let's brainstorm
a few more ways to die.

53:04.897 --> 53:05.865
Let's!

53:09.669 --> 53:11.769
- Stabbing?
- No, I don't like knives.

53:11.771 --> 53:14.037
It sounds very,
sort of messy and painful.

53:14.039 --> 53:16.439
That's the sort of thing
he's gonna need to know.

53:16.441 --> 53:18.642
- Who?
- Our possibly fictitious,

53:18.644 --> 53:19.910
but possibly real hit man,

53:19.912 --> 53:20.977
who happens to be
my new boyfriend.

53:20.979 --> 53:22.578
Oh, okay.

53:22.580 --> 53:25.948
Ooh, what about a hit and run?

53:30.656 --> 53:33.589
Oh, now, I have a problem
with that.

53:33.591 --> 53:35.692
- Go on.
- What if I just get mangled?

53:35.694 --> 53:38.861
He'd have to reverse
back over me.

53:38.863 --> 53:41.098
That's just horrifying.

53:41.100 --> 53:42.933
Hmm.

53:42.935 --> 53:45.336
- Pushing?
- I don't follow.

53:45.338 --> 53:47.337
Off a tall building,
for the sake of argument,

53:47.339 --> 53:49.406
or in front of a train.

53:49.408 --> 53:53.644
I must say I have explored
the idea of trains somewhat.

53:53.646 --> 53:55.781
Hey!

53:58.050 --> 54:00.084
Short, sticky, and sweet.
Before you know it,

54:00.086 --> 54:02.352
you're strawberry jam
and dental fillings.

54:02.354 --> 54:03.921
You really can
paint a picture, Annie.

54:03.923 --> 54:05.823
Only downside's the whole
closed casket thing.

54:05.825 --> 54:08.758
Granted, but I am starting
to like the idea of falling.

54:08.760 --> 54:10.894
It sounds almost accidental.

54:10.896 --> 54:12.763
Can we bank it, pushing?

54:12.765 --> 54:14.430
Yeah, let's have it.

54:14.432 --> 54:16.066
To imminent death.

54:16.068 --> 54:17.667
To the 404.

54:31.484 --> 54:32.485
What's up?

54:33.919 --> 54:35.118
What?

54:35.120 --> 54:37.854
Is there anything
you want to say?

54:37.856 --> 54:39.325
No.

54:48.401 --> 54:49.866
I'm seriously fucking bored.

54:49.868 --> 54:51.535
You want to play a game?

54:51.537 --> 54:53.569
Do I look like I play
Snakes and Ladders to you?

54:53.571 --> 54:55.675
Well, you did do that jigsaw.

54:58.510 --> 54:59.709
I fucking hate puzzles.

54:59.711 --> 55:01.547
You did do that crossword book.

55:03.182 --> 55:05.084
- You trying to be funny?
- What about chess?

55:07.952 --> 55:10.654
- Are you trying to be funny?
- No, Boss.

55:10.656 --> 55:13.656
So I don't have to come over and
teach you some fucking manners.

55:13.658 --> 55:15.158
- No, Boss.
- Because if I do

55:15.160 --> 55:18.729
you're gonna fucking regret it,
you understand me?

55:18.731 --> 55:20.499
Yes, Boss.

55:26.604 --> 55:27.539
Good.

55:31.577 --> 55:34.144
Don't fancy Monopoly then?

55:34.146 --> 55:36.647
God, keep it up.

55:36.649 --> 55:39.683
I'm going to put you six feet
under the fucking ground, mate.

55:39.685 --> 55:42.122
Are you?

55:43.955 --> 55:46.156
You know, I don't know
why I bother on you.

55:46.158 --> 55:48.459
I should just shoot you
in the face,

55:48.461 --> 55:49.859
get myself another apprentice.

55:49.861 --> 55:51.928
I thought I was
a junior partner.

55:51.930 --> 55:55.799
Oh, that's just the flash way
of saying "apprentice."

55:55.801 --> 55:57.033
I'm a valuable asset.

55:57.035 --> 55:59.903
You're a fucking liability.

55:59.905 --> 56:02.538
I already told you what I do
with fucking liabilities.

56:02.540 --> 56:05.107
If it wasn't for me,
who'd make the tea,

56:05.109 --> 56:07.678
collect the cash,
sort the jobs?

56:07.680 --> 56:10.716
You know, do the fucking work!

56:13.752 --> 56:16.456
Good lad.
Now you're getting it.

56:38.843 --> 56:41.111
Oh, cracking.

56:41.113 --> 56:43.247
Pathetic fallacy.

56:43.249 --> 56:45.249
Whinging librarian.

56:45.251 --> 56:47.149
Excuse me?

56:47.151 --> 56:50.153
No, that's what that's called,
when emotional turmoil

56:50.155 --> 56:52.723
is reflected
in tangible surroundings.

56:52.725 --> 56:56.692
Like two lovers go their
separate ways in a rainstorm,

56:56.694 --> 56:59.962
or lightning strikes
as the murderer's revealed.

56:59.964 --> 57:01.564
It adds gravitas.

57:01.566 --> 57:03.165
It would hardly be
as nerve-wracking

57:03.167 --> 57:05.002
if the serial killer
stabbed his victim to death

57:05.004 --> 57:06.569
in a sunny park, would it?

57:06.571 --> 57:10.707
Much better in a dark alley
in a mist.

57:10.709 --> 57:14.310
My God, you are wasted
as a teacher.

57:14.312 --> 57:17.080
You should be published.

57:17.082 --> 57:18.749
You should be preaching.

57:18.751 --> 57:21.183
You should be inciting
bloody revolution.

57:21.185 --> 57:23.854
And yet here I am,
a lamenting English teacher

57:23.856 --> 57:26.022
coughing his spleen
out through his nose,

57:26.024 --> 57:29.258
wishing the earth
would swallow him whole.

57:36.135 --> 57:37.537
Come with me.

57:39.972 --> 57:41.107
Really?

57:42.207 --> 57:43.243
Bill!

57:47.046 --> 57:48.515
Oh!

57:56.287 --> 57:58.087
Where are we going?

57:58.089 --> 58:02.625
To explore gravitas
and pathetic fallacy.

58:02.627 --> 58:04.062
Chop, chop!

58:10.903 --> 58:12.935
Well, this seems
like a great idea.

58:12.937 --> 58:16.372
Come on, Bill.
Where's your sense of adventure?

58:16.374 --> 58:19.711
Warm and dry
and congealing with my coffee.

58:39.330 --> 58:41.365
What the hell is that?

58:41.367 --> 58:43.100
It's an old ventilation shaft

58:43.102 --> 58:45.301
from when the city actually
used to work properly.

58:45.303 --> 58:47.069
It's condemned now.

58:47.071 --> 58:49.872
Just a hole
dropping into nowhere.

58:49.874 --> 58:53.910
Down and down and down.

58:53.912 --> 58:56.979
Well, that's just about the most
terrifying thing I've ever seen.

58:56.981 --> 58:58.714
You come here often, do you?

58:58.716 --> 59:01.151
Oh, yes, I love it here.

59:01.153 --> 59:03.754
- Here, come stand on the edge.
- No, I...

59:03.756 --> 59:05.692
Close your eyes.

59:06.925 --> 59:09.162
Feels amazing.

59:10.729 --> 59:13.663
Annie, come on back.

59:13.665 --> 59:14.798
Oh, my God!

59:20.339 --> 59:21.437
Well?

59:21.439 --> 59:23.173
Well, what?

59:23.175 --> 59:25.174
You said you wanted the earth
to swallow you whole

59:25.176 --> 59:26.877
not five minutes ago.

59:26.879 --> 59:28.278
There you go.

59:28.280 --> 59:29.982
You're welcome.

59:31.249 --> 59:32.816
You want me to jump in there?

59:32.818 --> 59:34.316
Pathetic fallacy.

59:34.318 --> 59:36.819
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

59:36.821 --> 59:39.756
Emotional turmoil reflected
in tangible surroundings.

59:39.758 --> 59:41.457
I'm in a deep, dark hole.

59:41.459 --> 59:43.794
It's perfect.

59:43.796 --> 59:45.261
Let's test your gravitas.

59:45.263 --> 59:48.031
- Or gravity, more like.
- Exactly!

59:48.033 --> 59:50.399
Look, I'm not gonna throw
myself into a yawning chasm

59:50.401 --> 59:52.269
just because it fits neatly
into a metaphor!

59:52.271 --> 59:55.004
Why not?
Quick, clean, painless.

59:55.006 --> 59:56.839
Poetically resonant.

59:56.841 --> 59:59.709
You are insane, certifiably.

59:59.711 --> 01:00:01.111
Unquestionably.
You get close to the edge,

01:00:01.113 --> 01:00:02.245
and then I can push you...

01:00:02.247 --> 01:00:04.781
Time out! Time out, okay?

01:00:04.783 --> 01:00:06.719
Okay, fine, fine.

01:00:10.122 --> 01:00:12.388
What the fuck was that?

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:14.057
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

01:00:14.059 --> 01:00:16.125
What is the worst that
could've happened, Bill?

01:00:16.127 --> 01:00:18.828
You'd be dead.
It would all be over.

01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:20.897
No more pain,
no more suffering.

01:00:20.899 --> 01:00:22.899
No more waiting for a train
that isn't coming.

01:00:22.901 --> 01:00:25.301
What if I had just let you fall?

01:00:25.303 --> 01:00:27.136
None of this would be happening.

01:00:27.138 --> 01:00:30.040
This conversation,
your smoldering anger,

01:00:30.042 --> 01:00:32.241
your eloquent
bloody resentment.

01:00:32.243 --> 01:00:33.843
Nothing.

01:00:33.845 --> 01:00:36.412
Not like that.
I do not want to go like that.

01:00:36.414 --> 01:00:38.214
Like what, Bill?

01:00:38.216 --> 01:00:41.921
Trains, cars, gunshots,
it's all the same end product.

01:00:44.923 --> 01:00:48.390
I think the question
really is,

01:00:48.392 --> 01:00:52.294
do you want to go at all?

01:00:52.296 --> 01:00:56.366
Standing on the edge really
makes you think, doesn't it?

01:00:56.368 --> 01:00:58.033
I'll shoot you in the face.

01:00:58.035 --> 01:01:01.037
I wish you bloody would,
but you won't.

01:01:01.039 --> 01:01:05.075
Stop thinking, Bill.

01:01:05.077 --> 01:01:08.011
Stop reasoning.

01:01:08.013 --> 01:01:10.446
Just close your eyes.

01:01:10.448 --> 01:01:14.950
Take a last breath
and just walk.

01:01:18.856 --> 01:01:20.857
Clock's ticking.

01:01:20.859 --> 01:01:22.424
It's quiet out there.

01:01:22.426 --> 01:01:25.298
It's like
a fucking apocalypse.

01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:36.506
Just one round.

01:01:36.508 --> 01:01:37.841
What?

01:01:37.843 --> 01:01:39.875
I said there's no one around.

01:01:39.877 --> 01:01:41.481
Yeah, it's dead.

01:01:43.314 --> 01:01:46.049
Like a corpse.

01:01:53.258 --> 01:01:54.491
Was that loaded?

01:01:56.127 --> 01:01:57.593
Yeah.

01:01:57.595 --> 01:01:59.197
You're dead.

01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:06.071
Milk, two sugars.

01:02:07.138 --> 01:02:09.175
What are you waiting for?

01:02:26.457 --> 01:02:27.894
That's it.

01:02:38.336 --> 01:02:40.337
No. No, I can't.

01:02:42.406 --> 01:02:44.843
How disappointing.

01:02:47.578 --> 01:02:49.145
Disappointing?

01:02:51.515 --> 01:02:54.084
Disappointing?

01:02:54.086 --> 01:02:56.888
This is all a fucking game
to you, isn't it?

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:01.491
Get this through
your little skull, okay?

01:03:01.493 --> 01:03:03.026
I am dying.

01:03:03.028 --> 01:03:05.395
I am...
I am going to die!

01:03:05.397 --> 01:03:07.930
To me, all this is real!

01:03:07.932 --> 01:03:11.234
The fucking hole
in the ground is real!

01:03:11.236 --> 01:03:15.537
I'm not standing on the edge.
I am already falling down!

01:03:15.539 --> 01:03:18.375
What are you, like, 23, 24?

01:03:18.377 --> 01:03:21.444
Young, fit as a fiddle,
immortal?

01:03:21.446 --> 01:03:23.613
All your death nonsense
is exactly that.

01:03:23.615 --> 01:03:26.683
A load of fucking nonsense!

01:03:26.685 --> 01:03:30.319
Step into the light more,
enjoy nice things.

01:03:30.321 --> 01:03:32.522
Stop skulking around
big holes in the ground

01:03:32.524 --> 01:03:35.225
and wasting your life
in all-night cafes.

01:03:35.227 --> 01:03:38.928
Enough with the facade,
this idle fucking fantasy!

01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:41.564
Go on, Bill. Go on, rage.

01:03:41.566 --> 01:03:44.466
Rage against the dying
of the fucking light!

01:03:44.468 --> 01:03:46.972
Did all this death stuff
start when mommy died?

01:03:48.372 --> 01:03:49.571
Ah, yeah.

01:03:49.573 --> 01:03:52.308
What was it,
an absent father?

01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:53.977
A concerned priest, perhaps?

01:03:53.979 --> 01:03:56.111
Did you find it was easier
to get attention

01:03:56.113 --> 01:03:58.113
if you were the freak,
the weirdo,

01:03:58.115 --> 01:04:02.151
the angel-faced kid
with a heart of darkness?

01:04:02.153 --> 01:04:05.120
I bet you were a cutter,
weren't you?

01:04:05.122 --> 01:04:07.189
I bet you loved
a good razor blade.

01:04:07.191 --> 01:04:10.192
Somewhere obvious where
everyone could see the scars.

01:04:10.194 --> 01:04:12.428
Did you have a little friend,
a little accomplice?

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:14.698
Somebody you could go off
behind the bike shed with

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:17.066
and burn each other
with cigarettes?

01:04:17.068 --> 01:04:19.468
Another little orphan helper
built in your own image,

01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:21.370
the two of you
egging each other on?

01:04:21.372 --> 01:04:24.040
Fuck! It's textbook, Annie!

01:04:24.042 --> 01:04:25.508
Textbook!

01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:27.977
You're two a penny!

01:04:27.979 --> 01:04:29.578
I have taught dozens of you
over the years.

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:34.183
I have known silly little girls
like you all my life!

01:04:34.185 --> 01:04:39.522
Naughty, naughty little girls
just like you!

01:04:43.095 --> 01:04:44.263
Naughty.

01:04:48.232 --> 01:04:50.700
I just enjoy watching
you fidget when I say...

01:04:50.702 --> 01:04:52.437
Naughty.

01:04:54.339 --> 01:04:55.274
Gotcha.

01:04:56.508 --> 01:04:57.643
Oh, God!

01:04:59.577 --> 01:05:01.613
Have we met before?

01:05:03.115 --> 01:05:05.080
You remember now.

01:05:05.082 --> 01:05:07.116
Don't you,
Mr. Braithwaite?

01:05:07.118 --> 01:05:09.752
I think I would definitely
remember you if we'd met before.

01:05:09.754 --> 01:05:12.622
You would thing so,
wouldn't you?

01:05:12.624 --> 01:05:15.660
You remember this
naughty little girl?

01:05:17.328 --> 01:05:20.263
You remember punishing me,
Mr. B?

01:05:20.265 --> 01:05:22.198
Silly, naughty little girls,
enough!

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.567
Maybe it's divine retribution.
You know, my sins revisiting me.

01:05:25.569 --> 01:05:27.136
I'm sorry.

01:05:27.138 --> 01:05:31.107
After lights out,
our little secret.

01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:34.580
Did something happen to you
as a child?

01:05:36.714 --> 01:05:40.151
I've waited all night
for you to remember me.

01:05:41.352 --> 01:05:43.819
All fucking night,

01:05:43.821 --> 01:05:47.490
not two feet away,

01:05:47.492 --> 01:05:51.394
just waiting for you
to connect the dots.

01:05:51.396 --> 01:05:53.763
Do you wanna know why
you don't have the balls

01:05:53.765 --> 01:05:57.133
to kill yourself,
Mr. Braithwaite?

01:05:57.135 --> 01:06:01.604
Because you know exactly where
you're going when you die.

01:06:05.209 --> 01:06:08.611
Orphans always make the best
victims, don't they, William?

01:06:08.613 --> 01:06:10.312
But chalk-stained fingers
leave indelible marks

01:06:10.314 --> 01:06:12.150
on little girls' panties.

01:06:13.484 --> 01:06:16.088
Consider this
divine retribution.

01:06:24.729 --> 01:06:26.665
Burn in hell.

01:06:35.841 --> 01:06:39.642
Was that gun loaded,
the one you pointed at me?

01:06:39.644 --> 01:06:42.444
<i>Impossible to say
either way.</i>

01:06:45.617 --> 01:06:47.716
- What's that?
- It's the fucking phone.

01:06:47.718 --> 01:06:48.686
All right.

01:06:53.725 --> 01:06:55.290
Yes?

01:06:55.292 --> 01:06:57.359
Okay.

01:06:57.361 --> 01:06:58.329
Got it.

01:07:01.533 --> 01:07:03.669
That was Mr. fucking Franklin.
It's on.

01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:12.745
Yeah.

01:07:20.385 --> 01:07:21.750
Yes?

01:07:21.752 --> 01:07:24.256
<i>Is this phone in range?</i>

01:07:28.526 --> 01:07:30.292
Where's the fucking target?

01:07:30.294 --> 01:07:31.828
Why aren't you
taking a shot?

01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:33.562
There is no shot.

01:07:33.564 --> 01:07:35.298
Take the shot, Vince.
What's the problem?

01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:36.635
Shut up!

01:07:39.271 --> 01:07:40.770
Bottle blonde!

01:07:40.772 --> 01:07:42.805
Fuck hell's she doing here?

01:07:42.807 --> 01:07:45.176
<i>Gotcha.</i>

01:07:49.414 --> 01:07:51.749
Put the gun down, Boss.

01:07:59.624 --> 01:08:01.491
What the fucking hell's
going on?

01:08:01.493 --> 01:08:04.894
This is what we call
in the trade "a double-cross."

01:08:04.896 --> 01:08:07.229
<i>Now put the gun down.</i>

01:08:07.231 --> 01:08:10.502
<i>And now sit at the table,
hands where I can see them.</i>

01:08:15.307 --> 01:08:16.438
You all right, bottle blonde?

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:18.340
<i>Took your time, sweetheart.</i>

01:08:18.341 --> 01:08:20.343
<i>Thought you actually were
gonna let him have a pop at me.</i>

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:22.978
Oh, I think he's been trying
that quite enough recently.

01:08:22.979 --> 01:08:24.279
<i>Stop it, Alfred.</i>

01:08:24.281 --> 01:08:25.415
Don't be naughty.

01:08:25.417 --> 01:08:26.782
<i>Sorry, sugarplum.</i>

01:08:26.783 --> 01:08:28.751
Now get yourself over here.

01:08:28.752 --> 01:08:31.756
Come and savor
this moment with me.

01:08:35.292 --> 01:08:37.426
I see you finally lost
your virginity then.

01:08:37.428 --> 01:08:39.430
Congratulations.

01:08:46.502 --> 01:08:47.839
Hi, handsome.

01:08:51.975 --> 01:08:53.443
You smell different.

01:08:53.444 --> 01:08:54.844
My new perfume.

01:08:54.845 --> 01:08:56.411
It's intoxicating.

01:08:56.412 --> 01:08:58.412
Oh, Jesus Christ, kill me now.

01:08:58.415 --> 01:08:59.482
With pleasure.

01:08:59.484 --> 01:09:02.618
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.687
Tell me something.

01:09:04.689 --> 01:09:06.524
What have I ever
done to you, eh?

01:09:08.693 --> 01:09:10.960
Vincent Escariot.

01:09:10.962 --> 01:09:12.894
Tut, tut, tut.

01:09:12.895 --> 01:09:14.630
You'd sell your own partner
down the river

01:09:14.631 --> 01:09:16.566
for 30 pieces of silver.

01:09:16.568 --> 01:09:19.001
I like loyalty I can buy.

01:09:19.002 --> 01:09:21.339
You traitor, you.

01:09:22.841 --> 01:09:25.474
What the fuck's it got
to do with you?

01:09:25.475 --> 01:09:29.011
Now, now, Vince,
don't be rude.

01:09:29.013 --> 01:09:31.014
I think you've been
quite rude enough

01:09:31.015 --> 01:09:32.982
to my other half recently.

01:09:32.984 --> 01:09:34.983
Your girlfriend's doing all
your thinking now, is she?

01:09:34.984 --> 01:09:37.487
Well, fuck you...

01:09:37.488 --> 01:09:39.854
and your fucking whore.

01:09:39.857 --> 01:09:43.059
Don't you misunderstand
the situation you're in

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:45.295
for one second, Vincent.

01:09:45.296 --> 01:09:46.996
You'll keep a civil tongue
in your head,

01:09:46.997 --> 01:09:48.598
or it won't be quick and easy.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.500
It'll be slow and messy.

01:09:50.502 --> 01:09:53.368
You are a fucking
pain in my ass!

01:09:53.370 --> 01:09:54.636
As well as being
a double-crossing,

01:09:54.638 --> 01:09:58.340
backstabbing,
turncoat traitor.

01:09:58.342 --> 01:10:00.542
But guess what.

01:10:00.544 --> 01:10:02.812
I've got a new partner now,
Vincent.

01:10:02.814 --> 01:10:05.415
And unlike with you,

01:10:05.417 --> 01:10:08.951
I just love it
when she fucks me.

01:10:08.953 --> 01:10:11.586
This is your doing,
isn't it, bottle blonde?

01:10:11.588 --> 01:10:13.755
Oh, yes, Vincent.

01:10:13.757 --> 01:10:16.024
I'm the master villain.

01:10:16.026 --> 01:10:18.995
Fucking crazy.

01:10:18.997 --> 01:10:22.098
The pair of you,
you're both mad, delusional.

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:25.401
Fuck you
and your fucking whore!

01:10:25.403 --> 01:10:28.307
You don't have to let him
talk to us like that, handsome.

01:10:31.042 --> 01:10:32.910
No.

01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:40.886
Your eyes. I saw them...

01:10:43.654 --> 01:10:46.022
Bye, Vince.

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:52.064
- That was fun.
- It was brilliant.

01:10:54.598 --> 01:10:57.367
Right. I need a shower
and a change of clothes,

01:10:57.369 --> 01:10:59.434
and then I'm taking you
out to dinner.

01:10:59.436 --> 01:11:00.702
My treat.

01:11:00.704 --> 01:11:03.773
Our first proper date.

01:11:03.775 --> 01:11:05.878
Bye-bye, sugarplum.

01:11:11.449 --> 01:11:13.385
Bye, handsome.

01:11:41.079 --> 01:11:43.749
Ah! Cleaning service.

01:11:45.516 --> 01:11:47.783
I'll have the works,
please, mate.

01:11:47.785 --> 01:11:50.489
The full spit and polish.

01:11:53.792 --> 01:11:55.627
Here's a cherry on top.

01:11:56.694 --> 01:11:59.461
Call it an apologetic token

01:11:59.463 --> 01:12:02.467
for the little overreaction
the other night, eh?

01:12:05.869 --> 01:12:09.140
See you later, Supe.

01:12:17.515 --> 01:12:18.784
Ohh...

01:12:30.794 --> 01:12:32.495
Hi, handsome.

01:12:32.497 --> 01:12:34.098
Hello, sugarplum.

01:12:39.904 --> 01:12:41.970
Did you get
your homework done?

01:12:41.972 --> 01:12:44.740
- Top of the class.
- Smart girl!

01:12:44.742 --> 01:12:47.643
I've got a little
surprise for you.

01:12:47.645 --> 01:12:50.078
Are you wearing that stripper
getup under that red coat?

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.516
Stockings, suspenders?

01:12:54.785 --> 01:12:58.489
You know, you really do
have such a lovely jaw.

01:13:01.758 --> 01:13:04.594
Wait right here.

01:13:04.596 --> 01:13:06.464
Yeah.

01:13:33.223 --> 01:13:34.193
Hello?

01:13:43.066 --> 01:13:44.168
Sugarplum.

01:13:47.105 --> 01:13:48.106
Sugarplum.

01:13:51.275 --> 01:13:54.109
I really hate that nickname.

01:13:54.111 --> 01:13:57.712
Drop the gun,
hands up where I can see them.

01:13:57.714 --> 01:13:59.549
One wrong move, handsome,

01:13:59.551 --> 01:14:01.216
you'll have that gaping
exit wound in your face

01:14:01.218 --> 01:14:03.219
we talked about.

01:14:03.221 --> 01:14:04.756
Drop it.

01:14:06.925 --> 01:14:08.526
Kick it away.

01:14:10.861 --> 01:14:12.196
Good boy.

01:14:13.664 --> 01:14:15.063
I thought we were partners.

01:14:15.065 --> 01:14:16.767
I've already got a partner.

01:14:18.302 --> 01:14:21.269
Cripple?

01:14:21.271 --> 01:14:23.072
So all of this was, what?

01:14:23.074 --> 01:14:26.175
An overelaborate scheme
perpetrated mercilessly upon you

01:14:26.177 --> 01:14:29.144
by highly motivated, highly
intelligent individuals...

01:14:29.146 --> 01:14:31.680
With a penchant
for amateur dramatics.

01:14:31.682 --> 01:14:32.717
It's pronounced <i>penchant.</i>

01:14:34.151 --> 01:14:36.719
You are correct, Alfred.

01:14:36.721 --> 01:14:39.621
Two weeks you had me
in that fucking apartment,

01:14:39.623 --> 01:14:42.858
waiting to kill someone
who was waiting to kill me.

01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:44.960
- Why?
- Because we like to have

01:14:44.962 --> 01:14:46.895
all our dollies
lined up on the shelf.

01:14:46.897 --> 01:14:48.197
Shit!

01:14:48.199 --> 01:14:50.765
Our starving rats
locked in a cage,

01:14:50.767 --> 01:14:53.238
tearing each other apart
just for our pleasure.

01:14:54.771 --> 01:14:58.640
And... you never
really liked me?

01:14:58.642 --> 01:15:00.846
Me? No.

01:15:02.279 --> 01:15:04.779
Has anyone ever told you

01:15:04.781 --> 01:15:07.215
that you are a two-faced,

01:15:07.217 --> 01:15:09.885
treacherous, manipulative,

01:15:09.887 --> 01:15:12.787
callous little bitch?

01:15:12.789 --> 01:15:15.726
Oh, you have no idea.

01:15:19.364 --> 01:15:23.001
Annie, darling, I don't
suppose you'd consider...

01:15:26.837 --> 01:15:27.972
No.

01:15:36.748 --> 01:15:39.648
Look, I know
you wanted to keep him,

01:15:39.650 --> 01:15:42.417
but we got bigger
fish to fry, okay?

01:15:42.419 --> 01:15:45.623
I've got the ID papers.
Give me his gun.

01:15:48.426 --> 01:15:51.093
Stand and deliver!

01:15:51.095 --> 01:15:52.995
Oh, Christ!

01:15:52.997 --> 01:15:55.200
You nearly gave me
a heart attack.

01:15:57.935 --> 01:16:00.402
You're early.

01:16:00.404 --> 01:16:02.203
Give me that gun.

01:16:02.205 --> 01:16:04.309
Where'd you put Vincent?

01:16:07.145 --> 01:16:08.814
What you gonna do
with them both?

01:16:11.048 --> 01:16:14.050
Can we chuck them
in the river?

01:16:14.052 --> 01:16:15.287
No.

01:16:17.187 --> 01:16:19.757
I've got a better idea.
Give me a hand.

01:16:38.943 --> 01:16:41.443
Ah, for a fool such as this.

01:16:41.445 --> 01:16:45.214
I shall think nothing
of tumbling downstairs.

01:16:45.216 --> 01:16:47.953
Curiouser and curiouser.

01:16:51.855 --> 01:16:53.389
See you around, Supe.

01:16:53.391 --> 01:16:54.559
Oh, good day.

01:19:42.493 --> 01:19:43.895
Yes?

01:19:45.162 --> 01:19:48.063
<i>It's done, Mr. Franklin.</i>

01:19:48.065 --> 01:19:50.131
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Both of them.

01:19:50.133 --> 01:19:51.367
<i>Good.</i>

01:19:51.369 --> 01:19:55.270
And the little favor,
the teacher?

01:19:55.272 --> 01:19:57.305
I'm forever in your debt.

01:19:57.307 --> 01:19:59.474
Did you have fun, sweetie?

01:19:59.476 --> 01:20:01.143
It was like jelly and ice cream.

01:20:01.145 --> 01:20:02.611
<i>The cripple was very useful.</i>

01:20:02.613 --> 01:20:04.979
End of the Line cafe.

01:20:04.981 --> 01:20:06.648
- He's just the messenger.
- Mum's the word.

01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:08.483
- All right, son?
- Cleaning service.

01:20:08.485 --> 01:20:10.286
He has his uses.

01:20:10.288 --> 01:20:12.991
Are you suitably impressed,
Mr. Franklin?

01:20:14.557 --> 01:20:16.024
Most definitely.

01:20:16.026 --> 01:20:17.292
<i>Good.</i>

01:20:17.294 --> 01:20:19.361
So I can rely
on your business then?

01:20:19.363 --> 01:20:22.697
I have a limited
range of choice.

01:20:22.699 --> 01:20:26.237
You've suppressed
the competition admirably.

01:20:28.239 --> 01:20:31.340
How do I know you're not
going to double-cross me?

01:20:31.342 --> 01:20:33.142
<i>You seem very adept at it.</i>

01:20:33.144 --> 01:20:35.544
<i>How, indeed. But remember,</i>

01:20:35.546 --> 01:20:37.645
<i>I like loyalty I can buy,</i>

01:20:37.647 --> 01:20:40.482
<i>and you are unique.</i>

01:20:40.484 --> 01:20:43.385
<i>You're one of a kind.</i>

01:20:43.387 --> 01:20:45.891
You have proved
your value to me.

01:20:47.658 --> 01:20:52.594
So is this the start of
a beautiful relationship then?

01:20:52.596 --> 01:20:55.133
Most definitely.

01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:58.636
- Good night.
- <i>Good night.</i>

01:21:17.154 --> 01:21:18.987
404.

01:21:18.989 --> 01:21:20.324
Excellent.

01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:41.443
What do you want?

01:21:41.445 --> 01:21:43.077
There are two things in life

01:21:43.079 --> 01:21:45.417
for which we are never
truly prepared.

01:21:48.552 --> 01:21:49.487
Twins.

01:21:58.262 --> 01:22:01.599
Well, well, well, he lives.

01:22:03.667 --> 01:22:07.338
I'm sorry, Mr. Franklin,
is the light bothering you?

01:22:12.342 --> 01:22:13.742
Where am I?

01:22:13.744 --> 01:22:16.181
You like what we've
done with the place?

01:22:26.589 --> 01:22:29.390
A woman's touch
is what was needed.

01:22:29.392 --> 01:22:32.161
How... How the fuck did you...

01:22:32.163 --> 01:22:35.096
Look through the looking glass,
Mr. Franklin.

01:22:35.098 --> 01:22:37.733
Or shall we call you...

01:22:37.735 --> 01:22:39.434
Clinton?

01:22:39.436 --> 01:22:41.502
A rose by any other name.

01:22:41.504 --> 01:22:43.772
You've tumbled down
the rabbit hole

01:22:43.774 --> 01:22:46.541
far beyond hope
or rhyme or reason,

01:22:46.543 --> 01:22:48.609
flushed away
in a river of tears.

01:22:48.611 --> 01:22:51.546
You're mad!
Stark raving mad!

01:22:51.548 --> 01:22:53.282
Oh, we can't help that,
said the cat.

01:22:53.284 --> 01:22:54.582
We're all mad here.

01:22:54.584 --> 01:22:56.186
I'm mad. You're mad.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.853
Have you ever read it?

01:22:58.855 --> 01:23:00.090
It's our favorite book.

01:23:01.425 --> 01:23:04.225
Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

01:23:04.227 --> 01:23:06.394
Mommy used to read it to us
every night.

01:23:06.396 --> 01:23:08.096
We know it front to back,
cover to cover.

01:23:08.098 --> 01:23:09.564
Inside and out.

01:23:09.566 --> 01:23:11.532
If you gave us
a page and a line,

01:23:11.534 --> 01:23:14.103
we could give you the words,
verbatim.

01:23:14.105 --> 01:23:15.470
We hear tell it's hereditary.

01:23:15.472 --> 01:23:16.671
Like eye color.

01:23:16.673 --> 01:23:18.474
Or homicidal impulse.

01:23:18.476 --> 01:23:20.408
Blood will out.

01:23:20.410 --> 01:23:23.778
May we tell you a story,
Mr. Franklin?

01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:27.381
Are you sitting comfortably?

01:23:27.383 --> 01:23:29.686
- Then let us begin.
- Then let us begin.

01:23:31.387 --> 01:23:35.590
A long time ago in a place
not dissimilar to this,

01:23:35.592 --> 01:23:39.460
as a point of fact,
identical to this,

01:23:39.462 --> 01:23:45.134
there lived a young woman
called Chloe Merriweather.

01:23:45.136 --> 01:23:48.636
Now, Chloe Merriweather
had a gleam in her eye.

01:23:48.638 --> 01:23:52.140
She wanted adventure.

01:23:52.142 --> 01:23:55.611
One night in the aptly named
Anything Goes,

01:23:55.613 --> 01:23:58.147
Chloe Merriweather
succumbed to the wiles

01:23:58.149 --> 01:24:01.183
of one Clinton Sharp,
a low-level criminal

01:24:01.185 --> 01:24:03.652
with aspirations of grandeur,

01:24:03.654 --> 01:24:06.688
who whispered sweet nothings
in her ear

01:24:06.690 --> 01:24:10.759
and kept her drink topped up
and his powder dry.

01:24:10.761 --> 01:24:14.795
Theirs was a knee-trembling
relationship.

01:24:14.797 --> 01:24:18.332
Then for a time, very little
was heard of Chloe Merriweather

01:24:18.334 --> 01:24:21.335
until a year or so later
she reappeared.

01:24:21.337 --> 01:24:24.872
She'd grown up,
like all little girls do.

01:24:24.874 --> 01:24:28.309
She waited tables by day,

01:24:28.311 --> 01:24:30.578
and she danced on them
by night.

01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:34.683
For Chloe had a secret
that nobody knew

01:24:34.685 --> 01:24:37.585
buried deep within
her heart of hearts.

01:24:37.587 --> 01:24:41.322
She had two little girls
at home.

01:24:41.324 --> 01:24:42.890
Twins.

01:24:42.892 --> 01:24:46.230
The result of her passionate
tryst with Mr. Sharp.

01:24:48.766 --> 01:24:50.468
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

01:24:53.803 --> 01:24:56.871
But Chloe Merriweather knew
better than to involve Clinton

01:24:56.873 --> 01:24:58.907
in her daughters' lives,

01:24:58.909 --> 01:25:02.544
for she had seen
the shadow in his soul,

01:25:02.546 --> 01:25:04.414
the murder in his eyes.

01:25:07.717 --> 01:25:09.984
She kept them hidden
from the world

01:25:09.986 --> 01:25:12.487
and from Clinton Sharp.

01:25:12.489 --> 01:25:15.624
Deliciously sweet
were those times.

01:25:15.626 --> 01:25:18.727
But life is cruel,
and the world is small,

01:25:18.729 --> 01:25:21.630
and fate laughs mercilessly
at us all.

01:25:21.632 --> 01:25:25.767
One deep, dark night,

01:25:25.769 --> 01:25:30.538
Chloe Merriweather saw something
she ought not to have seen.

01:25:33.409 --> 01:25:35.779
Clinton Sharp working.

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:46.854
Chloe Merriweather
ran for her life

01:25:46.856 --> 01:25:49.860
through that deep, dark night.

01:25:51.494 --> 01:25:54.662
But it wasn't long
before Clinton Sharp

01:25:54.664 --> 01:25:57.366
came calling for Chloe

01:25:57.368 --> 01:25:59.667
with a canister of petrol

01:25:59.669 --> 01:26:01.705
and his cigarette lighter.

01:26:06.877 --> 01:26:10.578
Rumor has it
he whistled while he worked.

01:26:15.686 --> 01:26:18.553
But Chloe Merriweather
was a fighter,

01:26:18.555 --> 01:26:20.822
a wildcat with fierce tears,

01:26:20.824 --> 01:26:23.591
unwilling to go gently
into that good night.

01:26:23.593 --> 01:26:25.893
Chloe saved her little girls,

01:26:25.895 --> 01:26:29.363
but the wildcat could not
get herself to safety.

01:26:39.043 --> 01:26:43.411
And so it was we found ourselves
wards of the precinct,

01:26:43.413 --> 01:26:45.647
taken into the mercy
and kindness

01:26:45.649 --> 01:26:48.483
of St. Catherine's Orphanage.

01:26:48.485 --> 01:26:51.886
To the welcoming arms of
the priests and the teachers

01:26:51.888 --> 01:26:54.855
with their wandering hands
and their sticky fingers.

01:26:54.857 --> 01:26:58.794
Here we learned how to close
our eyes and bite our lips.

01:26:58.796 --> 01:27:01.462
We learned how to go elsewhere
in our hearts and our heads

01:27:01.464 --> 01:27:03.564
when the lights went out.

01:27:03.566 --> 01:27:05.567
As soon as our legs
would carry us,

01:27:05.569 --> 01:27:07.902
we ran far, far away.

01:27:07.904 --> 01:27:10.538
Survival was
all we hoped for.

01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:12.474
A feral existence.

01:27:12.476 --> 01:27:15.510
Until one day,
who should we see

01:27:15.512 --> 01:27:19.014
shuffling by with his cart
and his broom and his limp,

01:27:19.016 --> 01:27:20.549
but Clinton Sharp.

01:27:24.387 --> 01:27:27.822
In all his crippled glory.

01:27:27.824 --> 01:27:30.125
That selfsame whistle

01:27:30.127 --> 01:27:33.397
that had haunted
our nightmares for so long.

01:27:37.767 --> 01:27:40.068
So we hunted you, Daddy,

01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:44.038
and before long, we discovered
your clever little secret.

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:49.377
Mr. Franklin,
a master villain marionette.

01:27:49.379 --> 01:27:52.613
The legendary black briefcases,
the infamous voice messages,

01:27:52.615 --> 01:27:55.149
the lost art of mystery.

01:27:55.151 --> 01:27:57.051
What's in it?

01:27:57.053 --> 01:27:59.019
Another fucking
locker number.

01:27:59.021 --> 01:28:02.758
Oh, you gotta love
Mr. Franklin, don't you?

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:05.059
Who says mystery's a lost art?

01:28:05.061 --> 01:28:07.129
Who says
mystery's a lost art?

01:28:07.131 --> 01:28:10.732
And we let you track us, Daddy,
as we tracked you.

01:28:10.734 --> 01:28:13.768
Inch by inch,
we laid our plans against you.

01:28:13.770 --> 01:28:16.773
We baited our traps
and cast our lures.

01:28:19.109 --> 01:28:22.577
We pulled the strings
that made you dance.

01:28:22.579 --> 01:28:25.580
We knew exactly
what would get your attention

01:28:25.582 --> 01:28:31.185
and that you couldn't resist
hearing our confession.

01:28:31.187 --> 01:28:36.090
I need a teeny, weeny donation,
Mr. Nigel Illing.

01:28:36.092 --> 01:28:40.127
<i>Mr. Franklin, I must confess,
I've been a naughty girl.</i>

01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:42.430
<i>Meet me at
St. Catherine's Church.</i>

01:28:42.432 --> 01:28:45.032
This is
a well-conceived venue.

01:28:45.034 --> 01:28:48.469
I want your work,
your contracts, all of it.

01:28:48.471 --> 01:28:50.104
I'm afraid you're out of luck.

01:28:50.106 --> 01:28:53.809
I've been recommended
another interested party

01:28:53.811 --> 01:28:55.143
to take care of my problems.

01:28:55.145 --> 01:28:57.813
I'm better.

01:28:57.815 --> 01:28:59.814
I highly doubt it.

01:28:59.816 --> 01:29:04.853
You men, with your bad suits
and your pumiced hair,

01:29:04.855 --> 01:29:07.855
you're utterly predictable.

01:29:07.857 --> 01:29:10.125
I reckon to the point
of carelessness.

01:29:10.127 --> 01:29:11.526
Yes.

01:29:11.528 --> 01:29:12.893
Me?

01:29:12.895 --> 01:29:15.831
I'm the switchblade
in the garters,

01:29:15.833 --> 01:29:18.834
the stiletto in the stilettos.

01:29:18.836 --> 01:29:22.603
I'm the surprise
they never see coming.

01:29:22.605 --> 01:29:25.607
Who says mystery's a lost art?

01:29:25.609 --> 01:29:27.509
Who'd have thought?

01:29:27.511 --> 01:29:29.446
We're Daddy's little girls,
after all.

01:29:35.052 --> 01:29:37.518
And now we stand on
the brink of our vengeance,

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:40.557
on the cusp
of the wildest of justice.

01:29:41.691 --> 01:29:44.960
You are my daughters, yeah?

01:29:44.962 --> 01:29:47.595
In blood only, Daddy.

01:29:47.597 --> 01:29:49.197
Don't get too attached.

01:29:49.199 --> 01:29:51.666
Mommy has to be avenged.

01:29:51.668 --> 01:29:54.702
Tell us, Daddy, are you familiar
with the science of lobotomy?

01:29:54.704 --> 01:29:56.705
Much maligned
in this day and age,

01:29:56.707 --> 01:29:59.573
but somehow rather
fitting in this scenario,

01:29:59.575 --> 01:30:00.575
don't you think?

01:30:00.577 --> 01:30:02.510
Please, girls.

01:30:02.512 --> 01:30:04.712
Anything.
I'll do anything.

01:30:04.714 --> 01:30:07.215
But not this, please!
Not this.

01:30:07.217 --> 01:30:10.585
I beseech you
in your mother's name!

01:30:10.587 --> 01:30:12.019
I am your father!

01:30:12.021 --> 01:30:15.290
No, no, no.
Far too little, far too late.

01:30:15.292 --> 01:30:17.626
Shh, Daddy, easy.

01:30:17.628 --> 01:30:20.127
I've got you.
Try not to fight.

01:30:20.129 --> 01:30:22.130
The time has come,
the walrus said,

01:30:22.132 --> 01:30:24.064
to speak of many things,

01:30:24.066 --> 01:30:27.768
like shoes and ships
and sealing wax,

01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:30.173
cabbages and kings.

01:30:37.146 --> 01:30:39.781
An eye for an eye, Daddy.

01:30:47.324 --> 01:30:49.758
The coup de grÃ¢ce
is yours, dear sister.

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.561
The nail in the coffin.

01:30:55.565 --> 01:30:57.934
Send Mr. Franklin
to Wonderland.

01:31:06.743 --> 01:31:08.044
Night-night, Daddy.

01:31:18.922 --> 01:31:20.889
- Perfect.
- Perfect.
