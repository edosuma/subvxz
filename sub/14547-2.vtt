A lot can be learned
about a family

00:05.213 --> 00:07.298
by their breakfast table.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.884
After recently navigating
out of a rough patch

00:09.926 --> 00:12.887
George was determined to have
our relationship go smoothly.

00:12.929 --> 00:16.057
As a result, our breakfast
table was set with guilt.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.686
I should have made you
something hot.

00:20.895 --> 00:22.355
It's fine, I like cereal.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.607
I know, but I had time.

00:26.568 --> 00:27.902
I'm better than this.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.487
George, it's cool.

00:31.322 --> 00:34.367
Hey, why don't I make you
a nice lunch to take to school?

00:34.409 --> 00:36.369
Because it's Friday
and the cafeteria

00:36.411 --> 00:38.663
will be selling
parmesan-crusted tator tots

00:38.705 --> 00:40.707
which I will be buying
a dozen of

00:40.749 --> 00:43.084
like any self-respecting
American.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.758
I'm gonna make her
a nice lunch.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.551

'Open.'

00:52.844 --> 00:55.221
- Mnh..
- 'Open.'

00:55.263 --> 00:58.099
Uh-oh, look here, Dalia.

00:58.141 --> 01:01.186
I'm about to have a big old bite
of your eggs carmenara.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.981
Mmm!

01:05.023 --> 01:07.358
Quick, you better have some
before I finish it.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.693
You can finish it.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.403
Dalia, this hunger strike

01:10.445 --> 01:11.988
cannot persist.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.740
Sorry, mommy.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.533
Ever since you
and daddy Altman broke up

01:15.575 --> 01:17.327
I just haven't
had an appetite.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.453
Heed this, Dalia.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.038
You will undergo nourishment

01:20.080 --> 01:21.831
even if I have to ingest,
digest

01:21.873 --> 01:24.375
and straight retch
this egg dish into your mouth

01:24.417 --> 01:26.002
like a ruby-throated
hummingbird.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.712
Now open.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.589
Open.

01:29.631 --> 01:32.217
- Hmn-mnh.
- Dalia.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.384
Open it!

01:33.426 --> 01:36.096
[instrumental music]

01:41.559 --> 01:43.103
Lisa, call your brother.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.396
On the phone?

01:46.397 --> 01:47.899
Don't be a wisenheimer.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.318
- 'Call your brother.'
- He's in Florida.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.695
For the love of Pete,
just call him.

01:54.197 --> 01:57.200
Ryan. Breakfast.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.868
[laughs]

01:58.910 --> 02:00.328
And then, Fred, remember?

02:00.370 --> 02:01.412
He'd come bounding
down those stairs

02:01.454 --> 02:02.789
like a Carolina Clydesdale.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.124
He loved to bound.

02:04.165 --> 02:06.501
'And how I loved
watching him bound.'

02:06.543 --> 02:08.294
So glorious and graceful!

02:08.336 --> 02:09.671
[sighs]

02:09.712 --> 02:12.048
Unlike this one,
she's like a crippled turtle.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.967
'Would it kill you to trot,
Lass?'

02:14.008 --> 02:16.678
Is occasional skip
too much to ask?

02:16.719 --> 02:18.429
I have an idea.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.849
'Since apparently
this house is--'

02:20.890 --> 02:24.477
Nothing but a sad,
lonely, childless vestibule

02:24.519 --> 02:26.938
that used to be filled with joy.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.649
So why not plan
a couple's retreat?

02:29.691 --> 02:31.734
'Leave these hollow walls
behind.'

02:31.776 --> 02:33.778
(Fred)
'Ooh, not a bad idea.'

02:33.820 --> 02:36.739
You know, Dr. Oz says
after the kids move out

02:36.781 --> 02:38.241
the genitals can often think

02:38.283 --> 02:39.450
they're no longer needed.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.452
They can wither and die.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.037
'He would advise
your mother and I'

02:43.079 --> 02:45.915

to trick our genitals
into staying robust.

to start wearing hair feathers."

09:21.769 --> 09:25.106
Prior, I had only thought of my
bathtub as a place to get clean

09:25.147 --> 09:26.774
without ever realizing
the possibilities

09:26.816 --> 09:28.359
for entertaining friends,
family, colleagues.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.903
I think, I think I know
the movie you're talking about.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.572
- Mm-hm.
- You want something grand.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.365
- The Grand Canyon.
- Something dramatic.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.284
Cute little slut.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.994
That means yes.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.288
How do you feel about columns?

09:40.329 --> 09:42.832
A Greek bath house vibe.

09:42.873 --> 09:45.293
George, you are speaking
my language

09:45.334 --> 09:46.919
and speaking it fluently.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.547
I'm so glad,
I took that referral.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.090
Oh, I didn't know
this was a referral.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.592
- Who do I have to thank?
- Mm, well..

09:52.633 --> 09:53.968
And then Kimantha was all

09:54.010 --> 09:55.803
"You photoshopped
those hair feathers

09:55.845 --> 09:58.014
into those photos
after you saw me wearing mine."

09:58.055 --> 09:59.890
- And I was all--
- Dalia, you, you did this?

09:59.932 --> 10:01.517
Now we can hang out here
together

10:01.559 --> 10:02.852
free from Tessa's judgment.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.604
This is a "no judgment" space.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.480
What happens in the bathroom
stays in the bathroom.

10:06.522 --> 10:07.815
Look, Dalia, I'm sorry

10:07.857 --> 10:09.400
'but I-I can't use
this renovation'

10:09.442 --> 10:10.943
as a way of spending time
with you.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.613
But you said it was good
to see me, remember?

10:13.654 --> 10:16.032
Isn't it good to see me?

10:16.073 --> 10:18.951
Look, if you work things out
with Tessa

10:18.993 --> 10:21.120
then maybe you and I
could be friends.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.831
But until then,
I'm afraid

10:23.873 --> 10:27.084
I'm gonna have to be
all, "no."

10:29.170 --> 10:31.922
You're doing it wrong.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.091
Did all the empty-nest talk
hurt my feelings?

10:34.133 --> 10:36.761
Was I wounded when
they refused to acknowledge

10:36.802 --> 10:37.845
my very existence?

10:37.887 --> 10:38.929
No.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.349
Small price to pay, Tessa.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.351
This is the first time
in my whole entire life

10:43.392 --> 10:45.603
I've had this house
to myself.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.731
And you wanna spend it sitting
on the couch talking to me?

10:48.773 --> 10:50.483
That was not the intention.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.570
No, it was not.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.405
Oh.

10:56.447 --> 10:57.907
That's my cue to leave.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.408
Yeah, you best get to steppin'

10:59.450 --> 11:01.786
because let it be known..

11:01.827 --> 11:03.996
...I'm about to do surgery.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.666
'I need to prep this man
for the OR.'

11:06.707 --> 11:07.750
[door opens]

11:07.792 --> 11:09.585
Oh, boy!

11:09.627 --> 11:12.546
(Sheila)
'Guess who's back early?'

11:12.588 --> 11:16.008
We cut our romantic weekend
short because we fell in love..

11:17.218 --> 11:18.928
...with Victor Ha!

11:24.725 --> 11:25.976
What the hell is this?

11:26.018 --> 11:29.438
This is your new brother,
Victor.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.357
Victor, we forgot to mention
we also have a daughter.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.235
- Yeah.
- I love football.

11:34.985 --> 11:37.363
[laughing]

11:37.405 --> 11:38.989
Of course you do.

11:45.496 --> 11:46.956
How could they do this to me?

11:46.997 --> 11:49.625
I don't know.
He seems pretty sweet.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.794
Probably bounced around
a lot, huh?

11:51.836 --> 11:54.714
- Poor guy.
- Poor guy, what about Malik?

11:54.755 --> 11:58.092
I was about to give his
fine ass a transfusion.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.677
You are really committing

11:59.719 --> 12:02.680
to this whole surgery
sex-talk thing, huh?

12:02.722 --> 12:05.433
You absolutely have to.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.268
Weird, Dallas just texted me

12:07.309 --> 12:08.686
to pick up my final paycheck.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.229
What's weird about that?

12:10.271 --> 12:12.773
I haven't seen her
since the break-up.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.108
I hope it's not awkward
between us.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.651
Do you mind if I stop in?

12:18.487 --> 12:21.198
"See ya, wouldn't wanna
be ya."

12:21.240 --> 12:23.576
That's a 90s diss.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.244
Hey!

12:25.286 --> 12:27.329
Dallas, that's a '90s diss.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.165
So is your face.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.962
Did you just see that?

12:35.004 --> 12:36.714
Yeah, that was weird.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.090
But no weirder than a grown boy

12:38.132 --> 12:40.468
calling two perfect strangers
mommy and daddy.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.886
Did I tell you Victor did that?

12:41.927 --> 12:43.971
I wonder if Dallas
is trying to punish me

12:44.013 --> 12:45.765
for the whole
"George and Dalia" thing.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.600
Yeah, well,
Sheila's definitely punishing me

12:47.641 --> 12:49.351
for the whole
"being born" thing.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.854
(Tessa)
Lisa had a bone to pick
with Victor.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.230
And the next morning

12:53.272 --> 12:54.482
she decided to pick it.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.067
- Aah!
- Hello, Victor.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.612
Oh, Lisa, you startled me.

12:59.653 --> 13:02.281
You're a bit jumpy on your own
though, aren't you?

13:02.323 --> 13:03.783
Uh, no.

13:03.824 --> 13:06.494
No? My mistake.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.662
Guess I don't have
a real clear sense

13:08.704 --> 13:11.791
of who Victor is just yet.

13:11.832 --> 13:14.835
Would you say you're a loner,
wanderer?

13:14.877 --> 13:16.587
Grifter of sorts?

13:16.629 --> 13:18.714
- What's a grifter?
- Are you a conman?

13:18.756 --> 13:20.382
Because I'm getting
some mighty weird vibes

13:20.424 --> 13:23.469
coming from your direction
and it's not the onesie..

13:23.511 --> 13:25.054
...entirely.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.430
How old a man are you?

13:26.472 --> 13:29.433
Nine and three quarters, why?

13:29.475 --> 13:31.560
Let's call it ten,
you're pushing ten.

13:31.602 --> 13:32.937
I guess so, yeah.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.063
Great, so do me a favor.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.439
Cut the "mommy, daddy" crap

13:35.481 --> 13:37.233
'cause if you ask me,
it reeks.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.902
Oh, that's because
I just went number two.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.195
That's another thing

13:41.237 --> 13:42.446
bathroom seniority.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.824
I go first, understand?

13:44.865 --> 13:46.784
Sure, sis.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.619
And there's no hot breakfast
on school days

13:48.661 --> 13:49.662
so don't get your hopes up.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.580
We get breakfast?

13:51.622 --> 13:54.291
Yes, Victor, we do.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.670
Victor, how about some
cinnamon toast this morning?

13:57.711 --> 14:00.506
- Oh, boy!
- He's not even sick.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.425
Lisa, your brother has a big day
ahead of him.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.970
He might even be playing
some football after school.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.054
Isn't that right, Victor?

14:07.096 --> 14:08.514
Hut, hut, hike!

14:08.556 --> 14:09.974
[Shelia laughing]

14:10.015 --> 14:12.184
Oh, Victor,
you are a treasure.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.647
Lisa, did you stink up
this bathroom again?

14:21.986 --> 14:24.613
(George)
'And it turned out Dalia
referred me for the job.'

14:24.655 --> 14:27.449
But I told her not to bother
contacting me again

14:27.491 --> 14:30.369
unless she was able to make
things right with you.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.829
And how did she take it?

14:31.871 --> 14:34.206
Honestly, she looked crushed.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.499
But I didn't get sucked in.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.750
She was probably just trying

14:36.792 --> 14:38.002
to manipulate me,
like you said.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.088
Yeah.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.673
What's wrong?
I did everything you said.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.174
Did I mishandle something?

14:44.216 --> 14:45.718
No.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.847
I think maybe I did.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.267
On the one hand,
I hate her guts.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.978
On the other hand,
it sucks being dissed

14:56.020 --> 14:57.271
by someone
that you used to have

14:57.313 --> 15:00.024
a close personal
relationship with.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.901
I don't know what to do.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.695
Have you considered vaginal
reconstructive surgery?

15:06.947 --> 15:09.825
- Why would I consider that?
- I don't know.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.786
I just keep seeing these
pamphlets at my doctor's office.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.455
At the home, they used to serve

15:14.496 --> 15:16.373
steamed cauliflower
on Wednesday.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.375
It was my favorite.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.127
That's nice, Victor.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.879
Unfortunately, the other kids

15:21.921 --> 15:23.047
weren't too wild about it

15:23.088 --> 15:24.298
and they complained.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.050
Eventually, they stopped
serving it.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.885
Well, we're all very sorry
to hear that.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.970
They started serving
cabbage rolls instead.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.431
Cabbage rolls
make my throat itch.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.600
Sure, that makes sense.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.268
But I never complained, because

15:36.310 --> 15:37.645
I knew some of the other kids

15:37.686 --> 15:39.605
really like cabbage rolls.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.484
Right.

15:43.525 --> 15:45.110
Just because I hate cauliflower

15:45.152 --> 15:47.947
doesn't mean no one else
should be allowed to eat it.

15:47.988 --> 15:50.491
That's kind of the way
I see life, Tessa.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.410
Thanks.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.287
Thanks, Victor.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.331
Wow.

15:57.373 --> 16:01.460
That is not what I took away
from that story.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.837
(Tessa)
I may have welcomed
Victor and his advice

16:03.879 --> 16:07.383
but Lisa was still
determined to undo him.

16:07.424 --> 16:10.094
Perfect little son.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.012
We'll see about that.

16:16.934 --> 16:20.104
Everybody's got a bone
in their closet, Victor.

16:28.278 --> 16:30.447
'And I just found yours.'

16:33.075 --> 16:35.202
I can explain.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.537
This is a Bionicle.

16:36.578 --> 16:37.830
I know.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.540
I'm just holding it
for a friend.

16:39.581 --> 16:40.791
I hate those things.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.167
Those are for losers.

16:42.209 --> 16:43.794
This is Takanuva

16:43.836 --> 16:45.421
the Toa of Light.

16:45.462 --> 16:46.880
I wouldn't know.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.383
I'm more interested
into football, wrestling

16:49.425 --> 16:50.926
and throwing touchdowners.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.636
I love touchdowners.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.766
You know, Takanuva
was my favorite Bionicle

16:57.808 --> 16:59.018
when I was your age.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.519
Really?

17:00.561 --> 17:02.062
Victor, my whole life
I've lived in a house

17:02.104 --> 17:04.565
where no one understood me.

17:04.606 --> 17:07.443
I know how it feels to be
ashamed of your Bionicles.

17:09.862 --> 17:13.115
They taught us to just say yes
to whatever the parents ask.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.576
Your parents, they wanted
a football player

17:15.617 --> 17:17.161
with a great body.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.288
That's not me.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.040
I know.

17:21.081 --> 17:22.624
It's okay.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.797
You're doomed.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.891
(Sheila)
'How was football practice
today, son?'

17:38.932 --> 17:41.727
- Did you "go long"?
- Did I ever?

17:41.769 --> 17:43.062
Do you think you'll make
quarterback?

17:44.688 --> 17:47.858
I know it's hard, Victor,
but tell them.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.367
Mom, dad.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.828
I'm not who I said I am.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.372
I'm a grifter.

18:03.123 --> 18:05.667
No, no, no, no.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.544
How could we have been
so stupid?

18:07.586 --> 18:09.213
Sheila, did you tell him
your social security number?

18:09.254 --> 18:10.506
I don't think so.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.799
But we did discuss
my mother's maiden name

18:11.840 --> 18:13.050
and the street
that I grew up on

18:13.092 --> 18:14.551
'and the make
of my first car.'

18:14.593 --> 18:16.637
That's all he needs.
We're finished!

18:16.678 --> 18:19.598
He did not steal
your identity.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.975
But he did steal
someone else's.

18:22.017 --> 18:25.521
Yeah, I'm sorry, do I cancel
my credit cards or not?

18:25.562 --> 18:26.897
Not.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.024
But I'm afraid
Lisa's right.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.401
You see,
my body's not as great

18:31.443 --> 18:33.237
as you think it is.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.030
And I don't love football

18:35.072 --> 18:36.907
I love Bionicles.

18:36.949 --> 18:40.202
He's not a Ryan,
he's a Lisa.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.080
I understand if you don't
want me anymore.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.290
And I'm sorry I lied.

18:45.332 --> 18:48.085
- I'll get my things.
- Victor, you stop right there.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.087
You didn't steal our money.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.339
But you did steal our hearts

18:52.381 --> 18:54.633
which is only possible because
you didn't steal our money.

18:54.675 --> 18:55.676
[laughs]

18:55.717 --> 18:56.760
To be honest, we're relieved

18:56.802 --> 18:58.428
that you don't like football.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.472
- You are?
- You are?

19:00.514 --> 19:02.141
(Sheila)
'The last thing we want'

19:02.182 --> 19:04.685
is to lose another son.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.687
And I never heard of anyone

19:06.728 --> 19:09.189
getting a Bionicle scholarship,
have you?

19:09.231 --> 19:10.774
Nope, there's no such thing.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.276
[both laughing]

19:12.317 --> 19:13.944
Now, tell us all about

19:13.986 --> 19:15.487
this favorite hobby of yours.

19:15.529 --> 19:19.491
Well, when the Shadow Leeches
swamped Takanuva

19:19.533 --> 19:21.076
they underestimated
his cunning--

19:21.118 --> 19:23.579
Wait a minute, I have tried
to discuss Bionicles

19:23.620 --> 19:26.206
at this dinner table for years
and it was forbidden.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.125
Victor makes it sound
more interesting than you did.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.626
Victor knows
how to frame a story.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.962
Plus, you never mentioned
the Shadow Leeches, Lisa.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.255
If there are Shadow Leeches

19:33.297 --> 19:35.257
you lead with Shadow Leeches!

19:35.299 --> 19:37.843
(Victor)
Well, Takanuva, he wasn't..

19:37.885 --> 19:41.513
(Tessa)
With a bitter, deep-seated
rivalry now firmly in place.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.223
Lisa and Victor were starting

19:43.265 --> 19:45.517
to feel like
siblings after all.

19:45.559 --> 19:46.894
[doorbell rings]

19:46.935 --> 19:49.688
Just a sec.

19:49.730 --> 19:50.731
Oh, no.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.316
Tessa, talk to the hand

19:52.357 --> 19:53.483
'cause the face
don't give a damn.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.028
Relax, Dallas.
I'm here to see Dalia.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.490
I don't have your dad

20:00.532 --> 20:01.825
if that's what
you're looking for.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.327
No.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.662
I wanted to let you know
that I have been rethinking

20:05.704 --> 20:08.832
my stance on your friendship
with my dad.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.876
Just because I hate you

20:10.918 --> 20:12.294
doesn't mean he has to.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.004
He could never hate me.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.340
He thinks
it's good to see me.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.716
Ask him.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.551
You can ask him yourself.

20:19.593 --> 20:20.677
And in return

20:20.719 --> 20:22.012
can you please tell your mother

20:22.054 --> 20:23.472
to stop slamming me with--

20:23.513 --> 20:25.515
Whoop! There it is.
I thought you knew.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.267
I'm sorry. I'll stop.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.977
She made me, I..

20:30.812 --> 20:32.940
(Tessa)
Looking into her icy blue eyes

20:32.981 --> 20:35.609
I wasn't sure what this
all meant to Dalia.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.402
If anything.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.029
I had no idea
if things between us

20:39.071 --> 20:40.739
would be any different.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.491
Hey.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.618
I've been meaning
to ask you.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.620
How did things go
with your mom?

20:48.914 --> 20:50.832
She left.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.629
I know. I just wanted
to hear you say it.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.423
Thanks.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.634
But everything's good
with Ryan, right?

21:00.676 --> 21:02.511
Okay, see ya.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.597
[door closes]
