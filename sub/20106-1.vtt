WEBVTT

00:06.618 --> 00:10.155
<i>Oh death, where is thy sting?</i>

00:10.156 --> 00:12.756
<i>Oh grave, where is thy victory?</i>

00:12.758 --> 00:16.828
<i>For man that is born of woman
hath but a short time to live,</i>

00:16.829 --> 00:18.789
<i>and is full of misery.</i>

00:18.798 --> 00:22.434
<i>He cometh up and is cut down
like a flower.</i>

00:22.435 --> 00:25.504
<i>He fleeth as it were a shadow.</i>

00:25.505 --> 00:28.940
<i>In the midst of life,
we are in death.</i>

00:28.941 --> 00:32.610
<i>In the midst of death,
we are in life.</i>

00:32.612 --> 00:34.842
- It was a nice service.
- Hmm.

00:34.847 --> 00:36.617
And he had a good, long life.

00:36.618 --> 00:39.251
He did, for a heroin addict.

00:39.252 --> 00:40.852
Sad Archer wasn't there.

00:40.853 --> 00:42.283
Or here.

00:42.288 --> 00:44.990
It's been a long
couple of months.

00:44.991 --> 00:46.591
Three, next week.

00:46.592 --> 00:48.960
You should go sleep
in a real bed.

00:48.961 --> 00:51.421
I'm fine. I want to be here if...

00:51.430 --> 00:52.960
When he wakes up.

00:52.965 --> 00:55.465
Yeah. Did the doctor...?

00:55.468 --> 00:56.635
The same.

00:56.636 --> 00:58.636
Could be tomorrow,

00:58.638 --> 01:00.772
could be another three months.

01:00.773 --> 01:04.772
Could be... Yeah.

01:04.777 --> 01:06.177
Well, I guess I'll go.

01:06.179 --> 01:07.669
I'll try to bring
a.J. By tomorrow.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.380
Or Friday.

01:09.382 --> 01:11.112
We'll be here.

01:11.117 --> 01:13.557
At least he doesn't know
Woodhouse died.

01:13.558 --> 01:16.183
That would break his heart.
Mm-hmm.

01:16.189 --> 01:19.289
Although there's no telling
what he knows.

01:19.292 --> 01:21.692
Or what he's thinking about.

01:21.694 --> 01:25.094
Well, dreaming about, I suppose.

01:31.236 --> 01:33.205
No.

01:33.206 --> 01:34.206
No, no, no!

01:35.407 --> 01:38.143
No!

01:38.144 --> 01:39.844
No!

01:39.845 --> 01:42.145
Noooo!

02:21.916 --> 02:24.646
Let me go, goddammit. Come on!

02:24.653 --> 02:27.091
Go easy, Archer.
Poovey, I swear to Christ,

02:27.092 --> 02:29.319
I will punch you
right in the... genitals.

02:29.324 --> 02:32.793
It's okay. Let him go.
You big lummox.

02:32.794 --> 02:35.997
Oh, Jesus. Woodhouse.

02:35.998 --> 02:37.498
So, where are you, Figgis?

02:37.499 --> 02:38.969
You got any leads?
What do you think happened?

02:38.970 --> 02:41.427
I think he got too far
behind on his dope tab,

02:41.436 --> 02:42.866
so sometime last night
his dealer

02:42.871 --> 02:44.001
punched his ticket for him.

02:44.006 --> 02:46.206
Yeah, and wouldn't that
be convenient?

02:46.208 --> 02:47.508
Not for him.

02:47.509 --> 02:49.209
You little rat fu...

02:49.211 --> 02:50.781
Oh! Now, scram, Archer!

02:50.782 --> 02:53.879
Ow. Son of a... I mean, just ow.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.516
You can claim the body
at the morgue.

02:55.517 --> 02:57.317
But that better be
the last time I smell you

02:57.319 --> 02:58.719
anywhere near this case.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.220
Yeah, we'll see about that.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.552
Yeah? And we'll see
how you like it

03:01.556 --> 03:03.216
when I yank your P.I. License.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.485
See you around, poovey.

03:05.494 --> 03:06.664
Take it easy, Archer.

03:06.665 --> 03:08.191
Oh, hey, and Archer?

03:08.196 --> 03:10.226
Come to think of it,
where were you last night?

03:10.232 --> 03:11.632
Ask your wife.

03:11.633 --> 03:13.868
Ah, you know his wife left him.

03:13.869 --> 03:15.299
For you, Archer,

03:15.303 --> 03:17.638
'cause you screwed her tits off
at the precinct cookout.

03:17.639 --> 03:19.669
So then she thought the two
of you would get married

03:19.674 --> 03:23.044
and live happily ever after,
but then you were like, "what?"

03:23.045 --> 03:25.405
Exactly. That face right there.

03:25.414 --> 03:28.214
I...

03:28.216 --> 03:30.016
How does that help?

03:30.018 --> 03:32.488
Mm, humanizes you?

03:37.692 --> 03:39.062
Hey, pal. You got a second?

03:39.063 --> 03:41.391
I do not, actually,
and I am not,

03:41.396 --> 03:43.856
come to think of it, so screw.

03:43.865 --> 03:46.695
Hm. I'm sorry. Let me rephrase that.
What...?

03:46.701 --> 03:48.569
Do you know who I work for?

03:48.570 --> 03:50.600
Do you know how much
I don't care?

03:50.605 --> 03:52.205
About what? Living out the week?

03:52.207 --> 03:54.107
'Cause we're both
out of luck, friend.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.009
I left all my cash at the track.

03:56.011 --> 03:58.081
But if maybe you wanted
some dope...?

03:58.082 --> 03:59.410
Do I look like a junkie to you?

03:59.414 --> 04:01.014
I don't know.
I try not to judge.

04:01.016 --> 04:02.576
You used to sell to this guy.

04:02.584 --> 04:04.351
Yeah, woodhouse. He...

04:04.352 --> 04:05.586
Wait. Used to?

04:05.587 --> 04:07.547
He's dead. What?

04:07.556 --> 04:08.786
Oh, for the love of...

04:08.790 --> 04:11.790
He was one of...
No, he was my best customer.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.527
So, he was paid up?

04:13.528 --> 04:15.696
Paid up? He paid in advance.

04:15.697 --> 04:17.697
Yeah. He was not great
with money.

04:17.699 --> 04:20.129
Right? I mean, who
tips their dope dealer?

04:20.135 --> 04:21.865
So, I guess we're done here?

04:21.870 --> 04:23.440
We're done when I say
we're done.

04:23.441 --> 04:24.768
I'm sorry.

04:24.773 --> 04:26.943
Let me rephrase that.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.876
Okay.

04:29.878 --> 04:32.378
So, one of two things
is gonna happen here.

04:32.380 --> 04:34.210
Oh!

04:34.216 --> 04:37.276
Hm. Wonder what
the other thing was?

04:42.156 --> 04:43.656
Goddamn.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.827
Is it your feeding time already?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.258
I wish you wouldn't
antagonize him.

04:48.263 --> 04:50.003
Well, I wish you
could hold a tempo.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.830
Which, clearly, sarcastic.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.495
No, it wasn't.

04:55.504 --> 04:59.106
No, thank you, Zerk,
that will suffice.

04:59.107 --> 05:00.737
Huh?

05:00.742 --> 05:01.772
Wha... what's... what...

05:01.776 --> 05:03.806
Ah, there he is.

05:03.812 --> 05:06.650
The infamous Sterling Archer,
private eye.

05:06.651 --> 05:08.518
And I trust you know who I am?

05:08.519 --> 05:11.447
I do. But what do I call you?

05:11.453 --> 05:13.487
Mother will do.

05:13.488 --> 05:16.988
And so, you do know who I am,
but you don't care?

05:16.992 --> 05:18.192
What? No, I...

05:18.193 --> 05:19.631
That's what you told
my bartender

05:19.632 --> 05:21.628
when you stuck a gun
in his ribs.

05:21.630 --> 05:22.930
I... well, first of all,

05:22.931 --> 05:24.461
your bartender sells heroin.

05:24.466 --> 05:26.796
Gasp. And I pulled my gun

05:26.801 --> 05:29.470
because I'm trying to find out
who killed my partner.

05:29.471 --> 05:31.040
That would be woodhouse.

05:31.041 --> 05:32.839
Yeah. He... how'd you know that?

05:32.841 --> 05:36.280
It's my business to know a great
many things, Mr. Archer.

05:36.281 --> 05:38.338
What would you say
if I offered you a drink?

05:38.346 --> 05:39.806
I'd probably say bourbon.

05:39.814 --> 05:41.154
Old buncombe, if you've got it.

05:41.155 --> 05:43.317
Oh, I have a bit of everything.

05:43.318 --> 05:44.878
So I hear. Hmm.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.186
How do you take it?
Usually alone.

05:47.189 --> 05:49.319
Thank you for making
an exception.

05:49.324 --> 05:50.794
Please.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.897
And so, I do hope you'll
forgive Mr. Zerk

05:58.900 --> 06:02.036
for his hands-on approach.
Maybe.

06:02.037 --> 06:03.367
But I sure won't forget it.

06:03.371 --> 06:05.541
Yes. I believe that
was the point.

06:05.542 --> 06:07.908
I meant... I know what you meant.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.179
Cigarette? No, thanks.

06:09.180 --> 06:11.007
Never took it up. Really?

06:11.012 --> 06:13.350
But I thought they loaded
all you G.I.S down

06:13.351 --> 06:15.748
with cartons of them
on your way up the gangplank.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.550
They did. Supposed to
help keep you alert.

06:18.553 --> 06:21.193
I guess I found it all
stimulating enough.

06:21.194 --> 06:23.719
Hm. Normandy? 
Yeah.

06:23.725 --> 06:25.085
Omaha beach.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.528
By way of north Africa
and Sicily.

06:27.529 --> 06:29.999
And after Normandy,
through France and Belgium,

06:30.000 --> 06:31.358
all the way to Berlin.

06:31.366 --> 06:32.896
Well, I had to get to Berlin.

06:32.901 --> 06:35.001
I'd sent
all my clean shirts ahead.

06:35.003 --> 06:37.271
Mm-hmm. Speak any German?

06:37.272 --> 06:39.510
You know. "Don't shoot,"
"I surrender,"

06:39.511 --> 06:42.076
"Hitler's the tops," stuff like that.
Mm-hmm.

06:42.077 --> 06:45.177
Bronze star with two oak leaves
and "V" device.

06:45.180 --> 06:48.349
Legion of merit.
Croix de guerre with palm.

06:48.350 --> 06:50.517
Silver star with two oak leaves.

06:50.518 --> 06:51.778
Distinguished service cross

06:51.786 --> 06:53.846
with one oak leaf
and "V" device.

06:53.855 --> 06:57.515
Three purple hearts.
It goes on, Mr. Archer.

06:57.525 --> 06:59.885
Yeah, senior year,
I was voted class flirt.

06:59.894 --> 07:02.101
And yet, you turned down
a battlefield commission

07:02.102 --> 07:03.457
to second lieutenant.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.025
Well, after class flirt,
I mean...

07:05.033 --> 07:08.402
In fact, you left the army
at the same rank you went in.

07:08.403 --> 07:11.303
Buck private. And do you know
what that tells me?

07:11.306 --> 07:13.106
I need a new lock on my diary?

07:13.108 --> 07:15.038
That you don't like
taking orders.

07:15.043 --> 07:17.113
Yeah, or having my time wasted.

07:17.114 --> 07:18.312
So, if you'll excuse me...

07:18.313 --> 07:20.413
Oh, no. I will not.

07:20.415 --> 07:21.405
Excuse me? No.

07:21.416 --> 07:22.976
I just said. Sorry?

07:22.984 --> 07:24.884
Me too. I... wait. No. I meant...

07:24.886 --> 07:26.316
I know what you meant.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.321
I... look, I'm just trying
to find the bastard

07:28.323 --> 07:31.892
who killed my partner. With
which, perhaps, I can help you.

07:31.893 --> 07:34.131
With which... hang on.
Wait, really?

07:34.132 --> 07:36.629
Perhaps. But before I
could help you,

07:36.631 --> 07:38.561
I would need you to help me.

07:38.566 --> 07:40.926
I'll do anything to find
Woodhouse's killer.

07:40.935 --> 07:42.395
And then avenge his death.

07:42.404 --> 07:43.841
Well then, Mr. Archer,

07:43.842 --> 07:46.268
what would you say if I
offered you a job?

07:46.274 --> 07:49.109
I'd probably say yes.

07:49.110 --> 07:50.580
And also bourbon.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.936
Len Trexler.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.712
I assume you're familiar
with him?

07:56.713 --> 07:58.211
Who isn't?

07:58.212 --> 08:00.050
He's the biggest mobster in L.A.

08:00.051 --> 08:02.117
Well, maybe not for much longer.

08:02.118 --> 08:03.116
Why, is he sick?

08:03.117 --> 08:05.117
Wh... no, you ass.

08:05.119 --> 08:07.757
Although you could say
that his time has come.

08:07.758 --> 08:09.655
Wait. You want me
to help you make a move

08:09.657 --> 08:11.057
against Len Trexler?

08:11.058 --> 08:13.488
Whose hobby is dissolving
people in acid?

08:13.494 --> 08:17.324
Oh, now, Trexler doesn't do
the actual dissolving.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.431
That would be
his enforcer, Dutch Dylan.

08:19.433 --> 08:21.793
I don't care who
does the dissolving.

08:21.803 --> 08:24.233
But if you help me,
I can help you.

08:24.238 --> 08:26.938
Perhaps. You made that
very clear.

08:26.941 --> 08:28.441
Look, all I need you to do

08:28.442 --> 08:30.752
is go down to pier 9
in long beach tonight

08:30.753 --> 08:33.275
and simply observe
and report back.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.914
No. Oh, come on.

08:34.916 --> 08:36.645
I thought you had guts.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.650
And I'd like to keep them
in their current location,

08:38.653 --> 08:42.283
I.E., inside me, not melting
in a 50-gallon drum of acid

08:42.289 --> 08:44.630
with my shoes and feet and face.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.884
I'm in. Excellent.

09:18.893 --> 09:23.323
Then find killer,
uh, revenge do.

09:23.331 --> 09:25.131
Careful what you wish for.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.872
You just might get it.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.744
That's some set you got on you.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.414
I mean, not your... I...

09:41.415 --> 09:44.584
I meant... I know what you meant.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.085
Uh, yeah. Uh, let me start over.

09:47.088 --> 09:49.018
My name's Archer.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.253
Lana Kane.

09:50.258 --> 09:52.888
And, I'm sorry, but have we met?

09:52.894 --> 09:54.924
If we had, you'd remember.

09:54.929 --> 09:56.596
Stop it.

09:56.597 --> 09:59.897
And so, um, you're
the singer here.

09:59.901 --> 10:03.570
Wow. And you must be
an old gypsy woman.

10:03.571 --> 10:05.709
Close. I'm a private
investigator.

10:05.710 --> 10:07.876
I'm doing some work
for your boss.

10:07.877 --> 10:10.775
And apparently doing it
with a fresh new take

10:10.778 --> 10:12.408
on the word "private."

10:14.247 --> 10:15.877
Can I buy you a drink?

10:15.883 --> 10:17.543
Hmm. Bottle of PBR.

10:17.551 --> 10:19.251
PBR. Wow.

10:19.253 --> 10:21.113
I-I would have
thought your tastes

10:21.122 --> 10:23.456
were a little more, um...

10:23.457 --> 10:25.125
Pierre beauvais. Rouge.

10:25.126 --> 10:26.726
Ah. Problem?

10:26.727 --> 10:29.027
No. Not-not when you're
pulling down

10:29.030 --> 10:31.630
25 bucks a day plus expenses.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.867
And what sort of daily expenses

10:33.868 --> 10:36.368
does a semi-private
investigator incur?

10:36.370 --> 10:38.805
Bullets? Daily.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.436
Or, I don't know,
maybe a surf-and-turf dinner

10:41.442 --> 10:43.242
at the Polo lounge? Un-huh.

10:43.244 --> 10:46.374
And then maybe a room upstairs,
at the Beverly hills hotel.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.915
Uh-huh. And then, maybe...

10:48.916 --> 10:50.884
I'm gonna leave you here.

10:50.885 --> 10:54.015
Between hope and despair.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.486
What the hell does that mean?

10:57.491 --> 10:59.729
Before you shoot a big,
salty load in your pants.

10:59.730 --> 11:01.797
Shut up. How much
for the champagne?

11:01.798 --> 11:03.796
$26.

11:03.798 --> 11:06.128
Wha... I'm not paying 26 bucks

11:06.133 --> 11:09.633
for a bottle of frustration.

11:09.637 --> 11:12.007
You're lucky my ear hurts.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.933
There. Plus tip.

11:14.942 --> 11:17.978
How about the tip of my cock?

11:17.979 --> 11:19.949
Stop it! So, in that scenario,

11:19.950 --> 11:23.077
would I take your penis
in my hand? My mouth?

11:23.084 --> 11:27.554
Asshole. Wait, no.
I mean... not... goddammit.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.958
Pierre beauvais Rouge.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.459
Hardy har har.

11:33.461 --> 11:35.195
Hey, 1933 called.

11:35.196 --> 11:37.156
They want
their gold digger back.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.794
Meanwhile, I have to dip
into my rainy day fund,

11:39.800 --> 11:44.770
which is barely enough to buy
an extremely nice umbrella.

11:44.772 --> 11:47.307
Wait. What the...

11:47.308 --> 11:48.875
Holy shit.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.206
Leave it to woodhouse.

11:51.212 --> 11:53.882
Now I can find his killer
and take revenge.

11:53.883 --> 11:55.681
Although... I better get moving

11:55.683 --> 11:57.783
if I'm going to make it
to long beach in time.

11:57.785 --> 12:01.054
Okay. So, first thing
tomorrow morning.

12:01.055 --> 12:03.815
Well, or probably
after breakfast.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.984
After which, I just remembered
I'm getting a haircut.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.853
But after that,

12:07.862 --> 12:10.296
vengeance will be mine.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.697
Oh, duh.

12:11.699 --> 12:14.834
Just like you always
said, woodhouse,

12:14.835 --> 12:17.635
"lock the safe, Archer,
you dumb twat."

12:21.541 --> 12:23.211
<i>I wanted to get mixed up
with mobsters</i>

12:23.212 --> 12:25.750
<i>like mother and Len Trexler
about as much as I wanted</i>

12:25.751 --> 12:27.646
<i>a new hole in my head.</i>

12:27.648 --> 12:29.678
But I meant it when I said
I'd do anything

12:29.683 --> 12:31.343
to find Woodhouse's killer.

12:31.352 --> 12:32.986
Although, truth be told,

12:32.987 --> 12:36.517
I'd also do anything
just to see Lana Kane again.

12:36.524 --> 12:40.084
So here I am, headed straight
into the belly of the beast.

12:40.094 --> 12:42.754
Nothing between me and death
but my wits

12:42.763 --> 12:45.393
and the cold, blue steel
of my .45.

12:45.399 --> 12:48.499
I have no idea why
I'm telling you all this.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.670
Or why I picked you up.

12:50.671 --> 12:53.011
I don't even know
where you're going.

12:53.012 --> 12:55.107
Hopefully Long Beach.

12:55.109 --> 12:57.279
Well, too bad.

13:08.467 --> 13:10.667
Because I don't
need a spirit animal,

13:10.671 --> 13:13.506
and if I did, he'd be an ocelot.

13:17.710 --> 13:20.079
Okay. Observe and report.

13:20.080 --> 13:23.049
So easy, even a cop
could... wait.

13:23.050 --> 13:24.150
What the...

13:26.686 --> 13:30.586
Hm. Now, what's a nice,
unmarked LAPD girl like you

13:30.591 --> 13:33.331
doing in a place like this?

13:40.833 --> 13:43.763
So, what's Trexler importing?

13:43.770 --> 13:47.070
Some new, improved
people-melting acid?

13:47.074 --> 13:50.534
Dammit, they're in defilade,
I can't see what they're doing.

13:50.544 --> 13:52.704
I gotta get higher.

13:52.713 --> 13:54.073
That ought to do.

14:09.562 --> 14:12.565
Now, that is a lovely
parting gift.

14:12.566 --> 14:14.966
And who's our lucky
contestant, Bob?

14:14.968 --> 14:18.868
Come on, you bent prick,
look up.

14:18.872 --> 14:20.439
Dammit.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.208
Come on, move it.

14:22.209 --> 14:24.577
Huh.
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

14:24.578 --> 14:26.548
Guess Trexler's not opening
a Chinese restaurant.

14:26.549 --> 14:28.714
I mean, in this economy?

14:28.715 --> 14:30.445
A whorehouse, though,

14:30.450 --> 14:32.390
bet that's pretty much
recession-proof.

14:32.391 --> 14:34.116
Move, goddammit.

14:37.824 --> 14:39.884
Okay, Archer, just stay calm.

14:39.893 --> 14:41.153
Yeah, good advice.

14:41.161 --> 14:43.729
Ow! Oh. Still tender, huh?

14:43.730 --> 14:45.168
What the hell are you
doing here?

14:45.169 --> 14:46.595
Asking you the same thing.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.269
None of your damn business.

14:48.270 --> 14:49.937
Everything is my business.

14:49.938 --> 14:53.306
Oh. Including white slavery?
Yes, incl... wait. What?

14:53.307 --> 14:55.574
Those girls are
tied up, asshole.

14:55.575 --> 14:56.975
No, they're not, they're just...

14:56.977 --> 14:58.944
Ah, dog dicks.

14:58.945 --> 15:02.114
Yeah, so... but wouldn't
it be yellow slavery?

15:02.115 --> 15:04.515
Wh... I don't know, racist.

15:04.518 --> 15:07.086
White slavery's just as racist.
What?

15:07.087 --> 15:08.856
No. You know, if you
differentiate between,

15:08.857 --> 15:10.615
like, cotton-picking slavery...

15:10.624 --> 15:13.254
Jesus Christ... And then
white slavery, that's...

15:13.260 --> 15:15.194
Sexual slavery, then. Okay.

15:15.195 --> 15:16.825
Goddammit.

15:16.830 --> 15:18.500
My point is I think we're
both anti-slavery.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.628
Yeah, you're a regular
Granville sharp.

15:20.634 --> 15:21.994
But since I'm guessing that was

15:22.002 --> 15:23.302
your boss taking the payoff...

15:23.303 --> 15:25.463
But he didn't know
about this part.

15:25.472 --> 15:28.040
Or any part,
'cause he wasn't here.

15:28.041 --> 15:29.875
Wow. Well, I'm sold.

15:29.876 --> 15:32.376
Really? No, dickhead.

15:32.379 --> 15:34.509
And neither are they.
Whoa. Look,

15:34.514 --> 15:36.774
I don't know what the hell you
think you're gonna do.

15:36.783 --> 15:38.663
Well then, that makes two of us.
What are you...

15:39.885 --> 15:41.185
Oof.

15:41.188 --> 15:42.355
Well?

15:42.356 --> 15:43.916
Goddammit.

15:45.391 --> 15:47.491
Son of a bitch!

15:48.795 --> 15:50.725
I mean...

15:51.731 --> 15:54.166
So, funny story.

15:54.167 --> 15:55.697
Jesus, it's the cop, poovey.

15:55.702 --> 15:57.342
So, yeah. So...

16:16.223 --> 16:17.753
Okay.

16:17.758 --> 16:20.088
One of two things is gonna...

16:20.093 --> 16:22.523
Wh-what...

16:22.529 --> 16:24.529
What? ...The shit?

16:24.531 --> 16:27.066
They knew me from work.

16:27.067 --> 16:31.197
Ugh. What? You think
they heard that?

16:31.204 --> 16:33.404
Because, just so I
understand you,

16:33.407 --> 16:35.937
your theory is
the truck backfired,

16:35.942 --> 16:39.111
whereas your theory
is fireworks.

16:39.112 --> 16:40.112
They are Chinese.

16:40.113 --> 16:42.543
What in Christ foo Yung

16:42.549 --> 16:44.719
could they possibly
be celebrating?

16:44.720 --> 16:47.248
Who knows? They got
their own calendar.

16:47.254 --> 16:48.884
Go back there,

16:48.889 --> 16:51.289
you team of oxen, and...

16:51.291 --> 16:53.058
Can I help you?

16:53.059 --> 16:55.394
Out of the truck.

16:55.395 --> 16:57.095
Do you know whose truck this is?

16:57.097 --> 17:00.065
Do you know how much
I don't care?

17:00.066 --> 17:02.234
That's cute. No, seriously.

17:02.235 --> 17:03.535
You're making a...

17:03.537 --> 17:06.105
huge mistake. Huge!

17:06.106 --> 17:08.536
Do you hear me?
Yes. We're right here.

17:08.541 --> 17:10.382
Well, you better just kill me.

17:10.383 --> 17:12.906
That's... That's what I said.

17:12.913 --> 17:16.373
Because when, not if,
I find out who you are,

17:16.383 --> 17:18.483
I'm going to liquefy you.

17:18.484 --> 17:22.253
Okay. Same goes for
those Chinese whores.

17:22.255 --> 17:24.255
So I'm serious.
You better kill me.

17:24.257 --> 17:27.057
So, you're saying when I drive
this truck out of here,

17:27.060 --> 17:29.600
you'd prefer I drove over your
head, not your ankles.

17:29.601 --> 17:31.726
Wait, what? No, no.

17:31.731 --> 17:33.631
No, I meant...
I know what you meant.

17:44.477 --> 17:46.077
What?

17:46.079 --> 17:47.549
Nothing.

17:49.348 --> 17:51.917
I mean, I feel like I
already know the answer,

17:51.918 --> 17:53.918
but are you crazy?

17:53.920 --> 17:55.690
How are they my responsibility?

17:55.691 --> 17:57.158
Because your crooked boss

17:57.159 --> 17:58.957
took a payoff to let them
off that boat.

17:58.959 --> 18:00.459
What am I supposed
to do with them?

18:00.460 --> 18:01.927
Get 'em jobs.

18:01.928 --> 18:03.858
There are plenty of Chinese
restaurants, laundries...

18:03.864 --> 18:05.094
Now who's racist?

18:05.098 --> 18:07.128
No. Because those are places

18:07.133 --> 18:09.193
where other Chinese people
already work.

18:09.202 --> 18:11.172
They don't speak
English, dumb-ass.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.639
I do little bit. Then shut up.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.308
I'm so sorry.

18:16.309 --> 18:17.979
I can't even imagine
the day you've had.

18:17.980 --> 18:19.278
God, the week.

18:19.279 --> 18:20.809
The life. Shut up.

18:20.814 --> 18:24.174
Seriously.
Sorry about the laundry thing.

18:24.184 --> 18:26.284
You're doing this, end of story.
I...

18:26.286 --> 18:29.655
A story in which
a Los Angeles police detective

18:29.656 --> 18:31.316
murdered three people.

18:31.324 --> 18:33.824
Dick.

18:33.827 --> 18:37.657
Thank you very much! Thank you!

18:37.664 --> 18:38.994
Super.

18:38.999 --> 18:41.834
Now I get to go report
what I observed.

18:41.835 --> 18:43.535
Then drove a truck over.

18:44.803 --> 18:47.303
So, first, maybe a drink.

18:47.307 --> 18:48.977
Or 12.

18:50.042 --> 18:51.752
Goddammit!

18:53.479 --> 18:54.749
Goddammit.

18:55.981 --> 18:57.651
Goddammit!

19:01.888 --> 19:03.756
Who the hell is this?

19:03.757 --> 19:05.324
<i>Guess.</i>

19:05.325 --> 19:08.725
I-I was just coming to see you.

19:08.728 --> 19:10.558
<i>Oh, goody.</i>

19:10.564 --> 19:13.564
<i>Because I am just on pins
and needles... well...</i>

19:13.567 --> 19:16.197
to hear how you turned a
stakeout into three dead,

19:16.202 --> 19:19.772
one crippled, and Len Trexler
ready to go to war.

19:19.773 --> 19:21.333
<i>How do you already know that?</i>

19:21.341 --> 19:23.941
And I swear to god,
I've got half a mind

19:23.944 --> 19:26.044
<i>to just kill you myself. I...</i>

19:26.046 --> 19:30.046
But the other half says you're
slightly more use to me alive.

19:30.050 --> 19:31.380
<i>If... for now.</i>

19:31.384 --> 19:33.914
<i>I... because now you owe me.</i>

19:33.920 --> 19:36.690
<i>My office, Archer.
First thing tomorrow morning.</i>

19:41.361 --> 19:42.631
Ahem.

19:43.896 --> 19:45.864
Mr. Archer?

19:45.865 --> 19:48.595
Depends. Who's asking?

19:48.602 --> 19:50.269
Charlotte Vandertunt,

19:50.270 --> 19:53.539
heiress to the vast Vandertunt
publishing fortune.

19:53.540 --> 19:56.108
And I would like to hire you...

19:56.109 --> 19:57.309
To murder me.

19:59.445 --> 20:01.475
Okay.
