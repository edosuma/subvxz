05:40.000 --> 05:41.209
-How are you?

05:41.209 --> 05:43.149
-Sister?

05:41.209 --> 05:43.149
-Yes.

05:43.149 --> 05:44.250
Yes, Katie, nice to meet you.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.120
TERRY: This is one of the three?

05:46.120 --> 05:47.259
Yes, one of three.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.240
Could be identical.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.240
You have a brother.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.209
-Yes.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.209
-Okay so, what's that like,

05:51.209 --> 05:53.050
being part of the triplets?

05:53.050 --> 05:54.220
You guys close?

05:54.220 --> 05:56.180
Yeah. Yeah, we're all

05:54.220 --> 05:56.180
super close. As a triplet

05:56.180 --> 05:58.159
You're always competing

05:56.180 --> 05:58.159
for your parents' attention.

05:58.159 --> 05:59.250
We were in sports all year round

05:59.250 --> 06:01.120
and when I was five years old,

06:01.120 --> 06:03.269
my brother wanted

06:01.120 --> 06:03.269
to join wrestling

06:03.269 --> 06:05.189
and he chickened out.

06:05.189 --> 06:07.120
So of course I'm like,

06:05.189 --> 06:07.120
I'll do it.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.259
-TERRY: Really?

06:07.120 --> 06:08.259
-Like, I'll be in it. Yeah.

06:08.259 --> 06:10.220
-At the age of five?

06:08.259 --> 06:10.220
-SARA: Yeah.

06:10.220 --> 06:12.209
There wasn't really any girls,

06:10.220 --> 06:12.209
so I wrestled guys.

06:12.209 --> 06:14.170
In 2003 I was

06:12.209 --> 06:14.170
the national champion.

06:14.170 --> 06:16.269
TERRY: No kidding.

06:14.170 --> 06:16.269
Wow, that's cool.

06:16.269 --> 06:19.120
By the way,

06:16.269 --> 06:19.120
he was a yell leader.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.279
Need I say more?

06:20.279 --> 06:22.199
-PAUL: First of all--

06:20.279 --> 06:22.199
-TERRY: With the cone.

06:22.199 --> 06:24.160
We did that so we can

06:22.199 --> 06:24.160
get all the chicks.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.009
So at his school the football

06:24.160 --> 06:27.009
players were the nerds

06:27.009 --> 06:29.220
and the yell leaders

06:27.009 --> 06:29.220
were cool...

06:29.220 --> 06:30.240
said no one, ever.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.189
[laughing]

06:32.189 --> 06:34.149
PAUL: You know what,

06:32.189 --> 06:34.149
you're kind of ruining this.

06:34.149 --> 06:37.139
-Am I not, am I not--

06:34.149 --> 06:37.139
-No, no. You are being a dick.

06:37.139 --> 06:39.240
Anyway...

06:37.139 --> 06:39.240
So with that, obviously,

06:39.240 --> 06:41.110
something happened.

06:41.110 --> 06:43.120
Yes. So when

06:41.110 --> 06:43.120
I was in third grade,

06:43.120 --> 06:46.279
I was in a wrestling match,

06:43.120 --> 06:46.279
and I got cross-faced.

06:46.279 --> 06:50.019
At that point was like pushed

06:46.279 --> 06:50.019
over to one side of your face-

06:50.019 --> 06:51.230
Yeah, it looked like

06:50.019 --> 06:51.230
a knot right here.

06:51.230 --> 06:54.019
-Like, it was crooked.

06:51.230 --> 06:54.019
-So it was a real break.

06:54.019 --> 06:55.279
Yeah. I mean,

06:54.019 --> 06:55.279
I was little I didn't care

06:55.279 --> 06:57.159
about my appearance

06:55.279 --> 06:57.159
until I started

06:57.159 --> 06:59.129
using social media

06:57.159 --> 06:59.129
to meet people.

06:59.129 --> 07:01.069
You know, I could talk

06:59.129 --> 07:01.069
to people all day long,

07:01.069 --> 07:02.240
but then meeting up.

07:01.069 --> 07:02.240
I was like,

07:02.240 --> 07:04.240
"what are they going

07:02.240 --> 07:04.240
to say about my nose?"

07:04.240 --> 07:07.069
So at that point, you said,

07:04.240 --> 07:07.069
"I gotta take care of my nose."

07:07.069 --> 07:10.120
Yeah, um, five years ago,

07:07.069 --> 07:10.120
I saw this billboard

07:10.120 --> 07:12.220
of this doctor that was,

07:10.120 --> 07:12.220
like, three hours away.

07:12.220 --> 07:14.199
I got a consultation

07:12.220 --> 07:14.199
right away.

07:14.199 --> 07:16.079
I drove to the doctor,

07:14.199 --> 07:16.079
I walk-

07:16.079 --> 07:17.279
-But he's on billboards.

07:16.079 --> 07:17.279
-Yeah, he's on-

07:17.279 --> 07:19.189
That's what I told her.

07:17.279 --> 07:19.189
I was like,

07:19.189 --> 07:20.220
"If he's advertising

07:19.189 --> 07:20.220
on billboards,

07:20.220 --> 07:22.269
"on the radio, then..."

07:22.269 --> 07:25.170
If your plastic surgeon is good,

07:25.170 --> 07:27.250
would he be advertising

07:25.170 --> 07:27.250
himself on a billboard?

07:27.250 --> 07:31.199
"Got boobs, got butts,

07:27.250 --> 07:31.199
got liposuction?"

07:32.189 --> 07:34.139
He don't got patients.

07:34.139 --> 07:36.009
He came in,

07:34.139 --> 07:36.009
but he only came in

07:36.009 --> 07:38.129
for a couple of minutes,

07:36.009 --> 07:38.129
if that.

07:38.129 --> 07:40.079
And then a nurse was like,

07:40.079 --> 07:42.259
"oh hey, we can get you

07:40.079 --> 07:42.259
in tomorrow morning."

07:42.259 --> 07:44.269
I know it should have

07:42.259 --> 07:44.269
been a red flag.

07:44.269 --> 07:46.180
You know, an opening

07:44.269 --> 07:46.180
the very next day,

07:46.180 --> 07:48.159
and they're putting me in

07:46.180 --> 07:48.159
a hotel room that night.

07:48.159 --> 07:50.269
But at the time, I had no idea

07:48.159 --> 07:50.269
what the process was like.

07:50.269 --> 07:53.230
-What happened?

07:50.269 --> 07:53.230
-SARA: I got the surgery

07:53.230 --> 07:55.139
and then I went

07:53.230 --> 07:55.139
to my doctor's appointment,

07:55.139 --> 07:57.129
like for them to take

07:55.139 --> 07:57.129
the bandages off.

07:57.129 --> 07:58.290
-The doctor wasn't even there.

07:57.129 --> 07:58.290
-Ugh.

07:58.290 --> 08:00.290
We walked in and then a girl,

07:58.290 --> 08:00.290
I don't even know

08:00.290 --> 08:02.259
if she was a nurse,

08:00.290 --> 08:02.259
took the bandages off.

08:02.259 --> 08:05.149
I just started bawling.

08:02.259 --> 08:05.149
It looked a lot more crooked.

08:05.149 --> 08:07.000
Yeah, it

08:05.149 --> 08:07.000
was devastating.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.199
I just felt, like,

08:07.000 --> 08:08.199
powerless at that point.

08:08.199 --> 08:10.139
The surgery

08:08.199 --> 08:10.139
did make it worse

08:10.139 --> 08:14.089
and that hit

08:10.139 --> 08:14.089
my self-confidence even more.

08:14.089 --> 08:16.279
Then eventually,

08:14.089 --> 08:16.279
I started going to therapy.

08:16.279 --> 08:18.209
Is that still continuing now?

08:18.209 --> 08:20.160
Yeah, but I still

08:18.209 --> 08:20.160
feel like I have

08:20.160 --> 08:22.040
the worst nose in the world.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.230
Okay, how many times a day

08:23.230 --> 08:25.139
do you look in the mirror

08:23.230 --> 08:25.139
at your nose?

08:25.139 --> 08:27.009
Um, all the time.

08:27.009 --> 08:29.000
Although I can clearly

08:27.009 --> 08:29.000
see from across the room

08:29.000 --> 08:31.220
that Sara's nose

08:29.000 --> 08:31.220
needs some help.

08:31.220 --> 08:35.210
But what I'm worried about is

08:31.220 --> 08:35.210
that she's very hypercritical

08:35.210 --> 08:36.269
of what she thinks

08:35.210 --> 08:36.269
of her nose.

08:36.269 --> 08:38.159
And with patients

08:36.269 --> 08:38.159
like that,

08:38.159 --> 08:40.159
no matter what you do

08:38.159 --> 08:40.159
for the nose,

08:40.159 --> 08:43.000
even if it's a great job,

08:40.159 --> 08:43.000
they're not going to be happy.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.250
So what I want to do is get her

08:43.000 --> 08:45.250
in the exam room,

08:45.250 --> 08:47.220
then have an honest

08:45.250 --> 08:47.220
discussion with her

08:47.220 --> 08:50.289
about realistic expectations

08:47.220 --> 08:50.289
and the complications,

08:50.289 --> 08:54.039
and see if she is

08:50.289 --> 08:54.039
a candidate for surgery.

08:54.039 --> 08:56.019
As doctors, to come

08:54.039 --> 08:56.019
in with a patient

08:56.019 --> 08:57.269
who basically says, listen,

08:57.269 --> 08:59.289
I feel I have the worst thing,

08:57.269 --> 08:59.289
you know, my nose,

08:59.289 --> 09:02.159
but you are hyper

08:59.289 --> 09:02.159
focusing on it.

09:02.159 --> 09:04.159
So, you know, that right there,

09:02.159 --> 09:04.159
that kind of, you know,

09:04.159 --> 09:06.200
makes it a little bit scary

09:04.159 --> 09:06.200
for us when we hear that.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.129
[tense instrumental]

09:10.049 --> 09:12.139
So when Dr. Dubrow and I

09:10.049 --> 09:12.139
were asking you,

09:12.139 --> 09:14.029
what do you think

09:12.139 --> 09:14.029
your nose looks like,

09:14.029 --> 09:16.029
you said it's the worst nose

09:14.029 --> 09:16.029
you've seen.

09:16.029 --> 09:17.220
Now, when we start

09:16.029 --> 09:17.220
hearing about this,

09:17.220 --> 09:19.169
we think of something

09:17.220 --> 09:19.169
called BDD.

09:19.169 --> 09:21.159
He wants to make sure

09:19.169 --> 09:21.159
that that isn't all focused

09:21.159 --> 09:23.009
on the post-operative results.

09:23.259 --> 09:27.009
I always wanted

09:23.259 --> 09:27.009
that Pamela Anderson look.

09:27.009 --> 09:30.059
But I didn't do any research,

09:27.009 --> 09:30.059
and now

09:30.059 --> 09:32.200
I can't even look

09:30.059 --> 09:32.200
at myself in the mirror.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.240
I'm ashamed

09:32.200 --> 09:34.240
of the way I look.

09:37.289 --> 09:39.269
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

09:39.269 --> 09:41.220
PAUL: Head back for us.

09:41.220 --> 09:44.250
So, your septum,

09:41.220 --> 09:44.250
that's this thing here...

09:44.250 --> 09:47.059
-TERRY: Wow.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.059
-So it's going like this.

09:47.059 --> 09:50.269
The bottom part's deviating

09:47.059 --> 09:50.269
into your left nostril.

09:50.269 --> 09:53.169
The top part is tilting

09:50.269 --> 09:53.169
over to the right,

09:53.169 --> 09:57.029
and that's what's tilting

09:53.169 --> 09:57.029
your tip over to the right.

09:57.029 --> 10:00.250
So first, before we talk

09:57.029 --> 10:00.250
about your surgery.

10:00.250 --> 10:03.110
If we decide at the end of this

10:00.250 --> 10:03.110
to do something,

10:03.110 --> 10:06.169
the negative thing is you can

10:03.110 --> 10:06.169
improve the straightness,

10:06.169 --> 10:08.000
but maybe not

10:06.169 --> 10:08.000
make it perfect.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.240
However, I can tell you now,

10:09.240 --> 10:11.200
no matter who touches your nose,

10:11.200 --> 10:13.230
you're always going to have

10:11.200 --> 10:13.230
that nostril asymmetry,

10:13.230 --> 10:15.039
maybe not as bad.

10:16.029 --> 10:17.210
So just hearing that,

10:17.210 --> 10:19.019
before even us committing

10:17.210 --> 10:19.019
to anything,

10:19.019 --> 10:20.269
how would you feel about that?

10:21.230 --> 10:24.110
I would still

10:21.230 --> 10:24.110
want it to be better.

10:24.110 --> 10:26.009
So let me talk about

10:24.110 --> 10:26.009
part two of this.

10:26.009 --> 10:27.210
SARA: Okay.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.149
So when Dr. Dubrow

10:27.210 --> 10:29.149
and I were asking you,

10:29.149 --> 10:31.059
what do you think

10:29.149 --> 10:31.059
your nose looks like?

10:31.059 --> 10:33.159
You said it's like a zero.

10:31.059 --> 10:33.159
The worst nose you've seen.

10:33.159 --> 10:35.190
He, me, your sister,

10:33.159 --> 10:35.190
don't see that.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.179
But the question now, when

10:36.070 --> 10:38.179
we start hearing about this,

10:38.179 --> 10:40.120
we think of something

10:38.179 --> 10:40.120
called BDD.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.000
Body Dysmorphic Disorder.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.049
You're hyper focusing

10:42.000 --> 10:44.049
on your nose

10:44.049 --> 10:46.289
and this is causing a lot

10:44.049 --> 10:46.289
of issues with your life.

10:46.289 --> 10:50.190
Body Dysmorphic Disorder is more

10:46.289 --> 10:50.190
of a self-image issue.

10:50.190 --> 10:52.250
And if you continue

10:50.190 --> 10:52.250
and you have surgery,

10:52.250 --> 10:54.169
sometimes you keep

10:52.250 --> 10:54.169
going back

10:54.169 --> 10:56.269
and have more, and more,

10:54.169 --> 10:56.269
and more procedures.

10:56.269 --> 10:58.220
But you're never going

10:56.269 --> 10:58.220
to be happy.

10:58.220 --> 11:00.080
What he's concerned

10:58.220 --> 11:00.080
about is that

11:00.080 --> 11:02.159
you're such

11:00.080 --> 11:02.159
a hyper-focused person.

11:02.159 --> 11:06.009
You were able to wrestle guys

11:02.159 --> 11:06.009
at age five to 13,

11:06.009 --> 11:07.289
win a national

11:06.009 --> 11:07.289
championship,

11:07.289 --> 11:09.269
which is awesome.

11:07.289 --> 11:09.269
He wants to make sure

11:09.269 --> 11:13.059
that that isn't all focused on

11:09.269 --> 11:13.059
the post-operative result.

11:13.059 --> 11:14.269
No, it's not.

11:14.269 --> 11:16.220
But we see this.

11:14.269 --> 11:16.220
This is a thing.

11:16.220 --> 11:19.190
Are you going to be happy

11:16.220 --> 11:19.190
with 70% improvement

11:19.190 --> 11:21.200
of straightness

11:19.190 --> 11:21.200
in nostril improvement?

11:21.200 --> 11:24.129
I would feel good about

11:21.200 --> 11:24.129
any improvement.

11:24.129 --> 11:26.090
-You're sure?

11:24.129 --> 11:26.090
-SARA: Yes.

11:26.090 --> 11:28.200
PAUL: Did a therapist say that

11:26.090 --> 11:28.200
he thinks that you're okay

11:28.200 --> 11:30.080
-to have surgery?

11:28.200 --> 11:30.080
-Yes.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.259
I don't expect to be perfect.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.259
I don't expect

11:32.259 --> 11:35.169
to be, like, an idealized

11:32.259 --> 11:35.169
version of myself.

11:35.169 --> 11:38.000
I just want to be me.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.220
[sighs]

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I mean, I hear a lot of great

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
things you're saying,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.100
and I feel good about it.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.070
And at this point,

11:44.100 --> 11:46.070
let's proceed.

11:46.070 --> 11:48.049
And if there's any

11:46.070 --> 11:48.049
issues that pop up

11:48.049 --> 11:50.139
or anything, make sure

11:48.049 --> 11:50.139
you, you know, contact us.

11:50.139 --> 11:53.250
-Let us know. All right?

11:50.139 --> 11:53.250
-Okay. Sounds good.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.279
[whooshing]

11:54.279 --> 11:58.259
[pulsing synth music]

12:00.259 --> 12:02.070
Come on! Come this way!

12:02.070 --> 12:03.259
Start out easy today, right?

12:03.259 --> 12:05.240
BRODY: Yeah.

12:03.259 --> 12:05.240
Hey, that's a nice dog!

12:05.240 --> 12:07.259
Now, give me your wallet- oh!

12:07.259 --> 12:09.070
Argh!

12:09.070 --> 12:11.019
Good boy!

12:11.019 --> 12:15.259
Off! Good boy. Come, sit, sit.

12:15.259 --> 12:19.009
Good boy. My name is Deana.

12:15.259 --> 12:19.009
I wanted Baywatch boobs,

12:19.009 --> 12:22.049
but instead my breasts look like

12:19.009 --> 12:22.049
they belong in a freak show.

12:22.049 --> 12:24.200
Right now, my right breast

12:22.049 --> 12:24.200
looks like

12:24.200 --> 12:27.269
a rotten apple that someone's

12:24.200 --> 12:27.269
taken a bite out of.

12:27.269 --> 12:30.110
My left breast

12:27.269 --> 12:30.110
is indented.

12:30.110 --> 12:32.090
I've had four breast surgeries,

12:32.090 --> 12:35.049
but my breasts

12:32.090 --> 12:35.049
still look pretty deformed.

12:35.049 --> 12:38.029
So what about you? You going

12:35.049 --> 12:38.029
to give it a shot with her?

12:38.029 --> 12:40.100
I popped an implant vacuuming.

12:40.100 --> 12:42.279
Do you think that that

12:40.100 --> 12:42.279
would be the smartest thing

12:42.279 --> 12:44.049
in the world for me to do?

12:44.049 --> 12:46.070
-Maybe soon?

12:44.049 --> 12:46.070
-I hope so.

12:46.070 --> 12:47.279
I didn't do any research.

12:47.279 --> 12:50.110
I essentially experimented

12:47.279 --> 12:50.110
on myself.

12:50.110 --> 12:53.259
And now I feel

12:50.110 --> 12:53.259
a bit hopeless

12:53.259 --> 12:56.289
just because I've spent

12:53.259 --> 12:56.289
a lot of money.

12:56.289 --> 12:58.259
I can't even look at myself

12:56.289 --> 12:58.259
in the mirror.

12:58.259 --> 13:02.009
I'm ashamed of the way I look.

13:02.009 --> 13:04.070
-TERRY: Deana!

13:02.009 --> 13:04.070
-DEANA: Hi!

13:04.070 --> 13:07.279
You guys look such like the

13:04.070 --> 13:07.279
happy, smiling couple.

13:07.279 --> 13:09.110
-Are you guys husband and wife?

13:07.279 --> 13:09.110
-Yes.

13:09.110 --> 13:10.240
And how long

13:09.110 --> 13:10.240
have you been married?

13:10.240 --> 13:12.120
Five years.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.029
Husband and wife sometimes

13:12.120 --> 13:14.029
start to look alike.

13:14.029 --> 13:15.289
-We've gotten that.

13:14.029 --> 13:15.289
-You get that a lot?

13:15.289 --> 13:17.129
If I didn't know

13:15.289 --> 13:17.129
you guys,

13:17.129 --> 13:18.250
I'd think

13:17.129 --> 13:18.250
you were massive narcissists,

13:18.250 --> 13:20.129
and I'll tell you why.

13:20.129 --> 13:22.039
Because you end up hooking

13:20.129 --> 13:22.039
up with someone else

13:22.039 --> 13:24.000
who looks just like you.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.009
Terry would absolutely

13:24.000 --> 13:26.009
marry himself if he could.

13:26.009 --> 13:27.259
Waah! Flex, let me see you flex.

13:27.259 --> 13:29.220
You'll go in looking like this

13:29.220 --> 13:31.169
and come out

13:29.220 --> 13:31.169
looking like this.

13:31.169 --> 13:34.129
-WOMAN: Turn, turn

13:31.169 --> 13:34.129
-[laughter]

13:34.129 --> 13:36.080
What is there to look at here?

13:36.080 --> 13:38.059
How many years ago

13:36.080 --> 13:38.059
did you have your breasts done?

13:38.059 --> 13:40.039
-18.

13:38.059 --> 13:40.039
-Okay, 18 years ago.

13:40.039 --> 13:41.230
When was the first one?

13:41.230 --> 13:44.090
2002. I was 23 years old

13:44.090 --> 13:47.289
and I'd always wanted, like,

13:44.090 --> 13:47.289
a really, really nice chest.

13:47.289 --> 13:51.049
I've definitely always had

13:47.289 --> 13:51.049
a fascination with big breasts.

13:51.049 --> 13:55.259
But all the way through

13:51.049 --> 13:55.259
high school, I was flat chested.

13:55.259 --> 13:57.220
And we all watched Baywatch.

13:57.220 --> 14:01.039
So, I've always wanted

13:57.220 --> 14:01.039
that Pamela Anderson look.

14:01.039 --> 14:03.019
How did that go?

14:03.019 --> 14:05.230
So there was only two

14:03.019 --> 14:05.230
plastic surgeons in town.

14:05.230 --> 14:07.240
So I chose the doctor without

14:05.230 --> 14:07.240
the consultation fee.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.029
That was it.

14:09.029 --> 14:10.250
-We've heard that before.

14:09.029 --> 14:10.250
-Yes.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.240
Happens all the time.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.240
A free consultation.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.080
Well, there's a reason

14:13.240 --> 14:15.080
why it's free.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.039
Is the doctor not busy?

14:17.039 --> 14:19.240
Unexperienced, doesn't get

14:17.039 --> 14:19.240
great results?

14:19.240 --> 14:21.070
Beware of the doctor

14:21.070 --> 14:23.259
that does not charge

14:21.070 --> 14:23.259
a consultation fee.

14:23.259 --> 14:25.149
So how many CC's

14:23.259 --> 14:25.149
was put in?

14:25.149 --> 14:27.029
-DEANA: 650.

14:25.149 --> 14:27.029
TERRY: You were pretty happy?

14:27.029 --> 14:28.230
DEANA: Oh, I was very happy.

14:28.230 --> 14:30.230
TERRY: Happy for how long?

14:28.230 --> 14:30.230
What happened?

14:30.230 --> 14:33.039
One year, almost to the day, one

14:30.230 --> 14:33.039
popped while I was vacuuming.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.149
So what did you do?

14:34.149 --> 14:36.230
-2005, back to the same one.

14:34.149 --> 14:36.230
-Okay.

14:36.230 --> 14:38.240
Got my surgery. A week later,

14:38.240 --> 14:40.059
this side was just mostly red.

14:40.059 --> 14:42.049
This side was starting

14:40.059 --> 14:42.049
to look infected.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.139
So I called his office

14:42.049 --> 14:44.139
and he said he was a week out.

14:44.139 --> 14:45.259
TERRY: He didn't say

14:44.139 --> 14:45.259
come right in?

14:45.259 --> 14:47.240
Mm-mm.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.120
PAUL: And knowing that you may

14:47.240 --> 14:49.120
have an infection.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.090
Deana had very early

14:49.120 --> 14:51.090
post-operative redness.

14:51.090 --> 14:54.009
That is almost

14:51.090 --> 14:54.009
a surgical emergency.

14:54.009 --> 14:57.059
And is absolutely not something

14:54.009 --> 14:57.059
that can wait a week.

14:57.059 --> 14:59.269
Two days before my appointment,

14:57.059 --> 14:59.269
I felt sick,

14:59.269 --> 15:03.090
this one was pussing really,

14:59.269 --> 15:03.090
really, really, really bad.

15:03.090 --> 15:05.080
And I went into the E.R.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.110
It's over now.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.110
They had to come out, I bet.

15:07.110 --> 15:09.029
-DEANA: Mm-hm.

15:07.110 --> 15:09.029
-Okay.

15:09.029 --> 15:10.139
He had taken out

15:09.029 --> 15:10.139
a lot of tissue

15:10.139 --> 15:12.100
on the underside

15:10.139 --> 15:12.100
on both of them.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.090
After I woke up

15:12.100 --> 15:14.090
from the anesthesia,

15:14.090 --> 15:15.289
both of my breasts were gone.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.250
I was left with

15:15.289 --> 15:17.250
just the top half

15:17.250 --> 15:19.100
of my breast, essentially.

15:19.100 --> 15:21.070
So now you've got distorted,

15:21.070 --> 15:22.259
deflated breasts

15:21.070 --> 15:22.259
with no implants.

15:22.259 --> 15:24.159
How long did you live

15:22.259 --> 15:24.159
with that for?

15:24.159 --> 15:26.009
Three years.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.200
-Three years? Wow.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.200
-Yeah.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.200
That must have been tough, huh?

15:29.200 --> 15:32.120
It really was. It really was.

15:32.120 --> 15:35.090
Shirts were not even allowed

15:32.120 --> 15:35.090
to touch the front of me.

15:35.090 --> 15:37.250
Like it was three XL,

15:35.090 --> 15:37.250
large shirts.

15:37.250 --> 15:40.059
It was sweatshirts.

15:37.250 --> 15:40.059
There was no way

15:40.059 --> 15:42.090
I was going to be

15:40.059 --> 15:42.090
in a bathing suit.

15:42.090 --> 15:44.000
Right.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
In 2008. My mom said

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
that she was going to pay

15:46.000 --> 15:47.159
-for me to get them done again.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.159
-Yeah.

15:47.159 --> 15:49.129
She vetted the other doctor,

15:47.159 --> 15:49.129
the one with-

15:49.129 --> 15:51.059
TERRY: The consultation fee!

15:51.059 --> 15:52.210
The one with

15:51.059 --> 15:52.210
the consultation fee

15:52.210 --> 15:54.080
to just put implants back in.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.259
-How'd they look?

15:54.080 --> 15:55.259
-DEANA: Better,

15:55.259 --> 15:57.070
but he said that

15:55.259 --> 15:57.070
they would drop down.

15:57.070 --> 15:59.029
And it just didn't happen.

15:59.029 --> 16:00.129
Because of Deana's

15:59.029 --> 16:00.129
horrible complication

16:00.129 --> 16:02.029
from her infection and the fact

16:02.029 --> 16:04.100
they removed most of

16:02.029 --> 16:04.100
her lower breast tissue.

16:04.100 --> 16:07.059
Unfortunately, and not

16:04.100 --> 16:07.059
surprisingly for Deana,

16:07.059 --> 16:09.139
just slapping in a pair

16:07.059 --> 16:09.139
of breast implants

16:09.139 --> 16:12.029
is not going to fix

16:09.139 --> 16:12.029
her distortion at all.

16:12.029 --> 16:13.269
Okay, so when you guys met,

16:13.269 --> 16:16.149
you had this phenomenon

16:13.269 --> 16:16.149
going on.

16:16.149 --> 16:19.009
Were you a little self-conscious

16:16.149 --> 16:19.009
about him seeing it?

16:19.009 --> 16:20.289
He doesn't see it.

16:20.289 --> 16:22.279
What do you mean,

16:20.289 --> 16:22.279
he doesn't see it?

16:22.279 --> 16:25.259
I still don't. It's hard because

16:22.279 --> 16:25.259
her confidence is down

16:25.259 --> 16:28.019
and everything,

16:25.259 --> 16:28.019
like let's get you feeling

16:28.019 --> 16:29.129
how you

16:28.019 --> 16:29.129
should feel!

16:29.129 --> 16:31.090
Like, there's no

16:29.129 --> 16:31.090
showers together.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.129
I don't even like to look

16:31.090 --> 16:33.129
at myself naked in the mirror.

16:33.129 --> 16:35.080
I want to look good.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.220
I want to be normal

16:35.080 --> 16:37.220
husband and wife.

16:37.220 --> 16:42.039
I want to, I want to come in

16:37.220 --> 16:42.039
being all sexy and cute.

16:42.039 --> 16:45.139
He treats me like

16:42.039 --> 16:45.139
I'm the most beautiful person

16:45.139 --> 16:47.110
that's ever walked

16:45.139 --> 16:47.110
this planet.

16:47.110 --> 16:49.289
And that's the way

16:47.110 --> 16:49.289
I want to feel.

16:49.289 --> 16:53.039
And the only reason

day, I wanted it so bad,

28:42.259 --> 28:44.210
and I love

28:42.259 --> 28:44.210
it to this day.

28:44.210 --> 28:46.059
I was looking at your photo,

28:44.210 --> 28:46.059
especially the eyes,

28:46.059 --> 28:48.009
I did not expect very engaging,

28:48.009 --> 28:50.039
-big, giant smile on your face.

28:48.009 --> 28:50.039
KEITH: Yeah.

28:50.039 --> 28:51.220
It kind of...

28:51.220 --> 28:53.190
It's intimidating.

28:53.190 --> 28:55.200
It kind of surprises people.

28:53.190 --> 28:55.200
I like tricking people.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.089
But Keith,

28:55.200 --> 28:57.089
the smile ruins it.

28:57.089 --> 28:59.019
Have you ever thought of,

28:57.089 --> 28:59.019
like, staining your teeth?

28:59.019 --> 29:01.000
No, I'mma keep these.

28:59.019 --> 29:01.000
I'mma keep these white.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.019
It started out with tattooing.

29:03.019 --> 29:05.079
Yes. It progressed

29:03.019 --> 29:05.079
into piercings.

29:05.079 --> 29:07.220
And then I started getting

29:05.079 --> 29:07.220
into my scarification.

29:07.220 --> 29:09.220
-Scarification?

29:07.220 --> 29:09.220
-Yes.

29:09.220 --> 29:12.039
We saw some scars

29:09.220 --> 29:12.039
in your photos,

29:12.039 --> 29:14.039
especially round through here,

29:12.039 --> 29:14.039
in the cheek.

29:14.039 --> 29:16.079
-KEITH: Yeah, around here. Yeah.

29:14.039 --> 29:16.079
-We didn't know what that was.

29:16.079 --> 29:18.039
-So, scarification.

29:16.079 --> 29:18.039
-Scarification. Yes.

29:18.039 --> 29:20.069
PAUL: So they cut out a wedge

29:18.039 --> 29:20.069
of tissue to create-

29:20.069 --> 29:21.240
-Definitely.

29:20.069 --> 29:21.240
-TERRY: Really?

29:21.240 --> 29:23.170
Yeah. Yeah,

29:21.240 --> 29:23.170
so the crazy part is,

29:23.170 --> 29:25.079
most of the people

29:23.170 --> 29:25.079
that I know eat their skin.

29:25.079 --> 29:28.220
So they'll carve it out,

29:25.079 --> 29:28.220
and swallow and chew it up.

29:28.220 --> 29:29.220
Okay.

29:29.220 --> 29:31.099
[laughing]

29:31.099 --> 29:33.279
On today's menu,

29:31.099 --> 29:33.279
a large piece of skin

29:33.279 --> 29:35.230
that I'll carve

29:33.279 --> 29:35.230
from your body.

29:35.230 --> 29:39.259
It's paired beautifully

29:35.230 --> 29:39.259
with a bold tannic merlot.

29:39.259 --> 29:41.190
What are you here for, then?

29:41.190 --> 29:44.069
I'm here to know how

29:41.190 --> 29:44.069
I could make my scars

29:44.069 --> 29:46.069
rise a little more on my face.

29:46.069 --> 29:47.250
For him to do scars

29:47.250 --> 29:50.009
and having them

29:47.250 --> 29:50.009
heal so perfectly

29:50.009 --> 29:51.279
was the direction

29:50.009 --> 29:51.279
that opposite of

29:51.279 --> 29:53.210
where he was trying to go.

29:53.210 --> 29:55.039
He wants something

29:53.210 --> 29:55.039
that's a little more defined

29:55.039 --> 29:57.059
that can be

29:55.039 --> 29:57.059
more noticeable.

29:57.059 --> 29:59.069
-More prominent.

29:57.059 --> 29:59.069
-Hypertrophic scars.

29:59.069 --> 30:01.019
-KEITH: Yes. I want them.

29:59.069 --> 30:01.019
-Thick scars.

30:01.019 --> 30:02.269
Yeah. I also want to do my...

30:02.269 --> 30:04.269
I want to remove my nipples

30:02.269 --> 30:04.269
and my belly button.

30:05.289 --> 30:07.279
PAUL: What about sensitivity?

30:07.279 --> 30:09.289
TERRY: Sensitiv- what are you-

30:07.279 --> 30:09.289
you like when Britney...

30:09.289 --> 30:12.190
You can play with them,

30:09.289 --> 30:12.190
or maybe you can suck them...

30:12.190 --> 30:14.269
-Yeah, no. I'm not, not into--

30:12.190 --> 30:14.269
-A certain pain. Yeah.

30:14.269 --> 30:16.210
[laughing]

30:16.210 --> 30:19.089
I'm so fat, I have big, huge

30:16.210 --> 30:19.089
nipples. It's disgusting.

30:19.089 --> 30:20.250
PAUL: So what are you saying?

30:20.250 --> 30:22.049
-Why?

30:22.049 --> 30:24.000
For my torso area,

30:22.049 --> 30:24.000
more design.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.289
And I plan on doing

30:24.000 --> 30:25.289
more tattoo cover ups.

30:25.289 --> 30:27.259
And just to be artful, you know.

30:27.259 --> 30:29.000
Interesting.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.259
I feel it is more play field

30:30.259 --> 30:32.210
for putting

30:30.259 --> 30:32.210
on more art.

30:32.210 --> 30:35.230
To work with Leslie,

30:32.210 --> 30:35.230
so you support them?

30:35.230 --> 30:37.089
I support him.

30:37.089 --> 30:39.230
You know, it's funny.

30:37.089 --> 30:39.230
So I remember

30:39.230 --> 30:42.109
when breast implants came out,

30:39.230 --> 30:42.109
in the beginning.

30:42.109 --> 30:45.049
And plastic surgeons

30:42.109 --> 30:45.049
thought it was crazy,

30:45.049 --> 30:47.230
and then it became

30:45.049 --> 30:47.230
instantly accepted

30:47.230 --> 30:49.059
It's just another variation

30:47.230 --> 30:49.059
on body mod--

30:49.059 --> 30:50.240
But what happened

30:49.059 --> 30:50.240
to those doctors

30:50.240 --> 30:52.049
in the beginning

30:50.240 --> 30:52.049
that actually started

30:52.049 --> 30:53.210
doing breast implants?

30:53.210 --> 30:54.210
What happened to them?

30:54.210 --> 30:56.000
They got an HBO special.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
[laughing]

30:58.000 --> 30:59.210
I can remember my mentor.

30:59.210 --> 31:02.049
I remember the day liposuction

30:59.210 --> 31:02.049
was a thing.

31:02.049 --> 31:04.000
And he said- he's a professor.

31:02.049 --> 31:04.000
He said like,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.230
"that is the most

31:04.000 --> 31:06.230
ridiculous thing ever",

31:06.230 --> 31:09.029
-and it's become like--

31:06.230 --> 31:09.029
-Look at it now. Yeah.

31:09.029 --> 31:12.019
So maybe this is

31:09.029 --> 31:12.019
a natural progression...

31:12.289 --> 31:14.220
-of modification.

31:12.289 --> 31:14.220
-You think so?

31:15.210 --> 31:18.240
The thing that

31:15.210 --> 31:18.240
I'm really curious about,

31:18.240 --> 31:22.019
is this whole nipple sucking

31:18.240 --> 31:22.019
stimulation thing

31:22.019 --> 31:23.269
that you're into.

31:23.269 --> 31:25.150
You never know where you might

31:23.269 --> 31:25.150
need those things.

31:25.150 --> 31:27.019
[laughing]

31:27.019 --> 31:28.130
Yeah, that's way

31:27.019 --> 31:28.130
more than I ever

31:28.130 --> 31:30.079
wanted to know about Paul, okay?

31:30.079 --> 31:31.289
To me, it looks like

31:30.079 --> 31:31.289
you just took me

31:31.289 --> 31:33.220
to the operating room, and--

31:33.220 --> 31:35.130
-Beat the heck out of you?

31:33.220 --> 31:35.130
-Beat me up, yeah.

31:35.130 --> 31:37.029
That's why you got

31:35.130 --> 31:37.029
that bruising.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.250
'Cause then, I wouldn't

31:37.029 --> 31:38.250
look like this.

31:38.250 --> 31:40.099
I would've came out with him

31:38.250 --> 31:40.099
looking like this.

31:40.099 --> 31:41.240
Oh.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.230
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

31:46.230 --> 31:48.019
TERRY: Okay!

31:48.019 --> 31:50.109
So you have the one scar here.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.289
Right.

31:51.289 --> 31:54.000
That's one scar,

31:51.289 --> 31:54.000
then you have that one.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.150
What's up here? It almost looks

31:54.000 --> 31:56.150
like um, is that a spider web?

31:56.150 --> 31:58.269
Yeah, spider web. Spider

31:56.150 --> 31:58.269
web coming out, all the way.

31:58.269 --> 32:00.059
Yeah, it came

31:58.269 --> 32:00.059
down all the way,

32:00.059 --> 32:01.250
and if I go bald,

32:00.059 --> 32:01.250
that's done too.

32:01.250 --> 32:03.049
PAUL: Can you stand up?

32:03.049 --> 32:05.029
Yeah.

32:05.029 --> 32:07.119
Okay, let me see the nipples.

32:05.029 --> 32:07.119
Nice nipples.

32:07.119 --> 32:08.230
Thank you.

32:09.230 --> 32:11.029
-So you want those nipples gone.

32:09.230 --> 32:11.029
-I want them gone.

32:11.029 --> 32:14.019
PAUL: He's got nice horizant-

32:11.029 --> 32:14.019
he's got a nice innie, there.

32:14.019 --> 32:15.140
You can sit back down.

32:15.140 --> 32:18.099
Yeah.

32:15.140 --> 32:18.099
So what you can do,

32:18.099 --> 32:21.019
is cut the belly button out,

32:18.099 --> 32:21.019
and let it close up

32:21.019 --> 32:23.269
on its own and it'll close up

32:21.019 --> 32:23.269
into nothing.

32:23.269 --> 32:26.059
That's what you'd want to do

32:23.269 --> 32:26.059
if you're ever going to do that.

32:26.059 --> 32:28.130
-So you mean you would--

32:26.059 --> 32:28.130
-You would leave it open.

32:28.130 --> 32:30.039
But doesn't it go all the way?

32:30.039 --> 32:31.240
How deep does that go?

32:31.240 --> 32:33.069
It goes all the way, baby.

32:33.069 --> 32:34.079
So the--

32:34.079 --> 32:39.150
[laughing]

32:39.150 --> 32:41.079
So he wants his belly

32:39.150 --> 32:41.079
button removed,

32:41.079 --> 32:44.000
which is a scar

32:41.079 --> 32:44.000
from the old umbilical cord.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.279
It's actually kind of possible.

32:45.279 --> 32:49.049
If you remove the belly button

32:45.279 --> 32:49.049
and just leave it open,

32:49.049 --> 32:51.150
it'll close up and won't

32:49.049 --> 32:51.150
leave a scar at all.

32:51.150 --> 32:53.000
You could probably

32:51.150 --> 32:53.000
do the same thing

32:53.000 --> 32:54.109
with the nipple, by the way.

32:54.269 --> 32:58.039
But, we are confined

32:54.269 --> 32:58.039
and restrained

32:58.039 --> 33:02.079
by what is common accepted

32:58.039 --> 33:02.079
standards of procedure

33:02.079 --> 33:05.130
and surgical principles

33:02.079 --> 33:05.130
here in this country.

33:05.130 --> 33:11.240
And amputating normal tissue is

33:05.130 --> 33:11.240
not something that, you know,

33:11.240 --> 33:13.259
we would necessarily

33:11.240 --> 33:13.259
be comfortable with.

33:13.259 --> 33:16.000
And I think here's

33:13.259 --> 33:16.000
my concern for you.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.140
If you go to a surgeon,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.140
a doctor

33:18.140 --> 33:22.140
who is comfortable amputating

33:18.140 --> 33:22.140
normal anatomy,

33:22.140 --> 33:24.289
that means there's

33:22.140 --> 33:24.289
something kind of eugh

33:24.289 --> 33:27.079
about that surgeon, you know,

33:24.289 --> 33:27.079
something wrong with him.

33:27.079 --> 33:31.000
So, your face. The thing is,

33:27.079 --> 33:31.000
it's hard to control

33:31.000 --> 33:32.150
exactly what

33:31.000 --> 33:32.150
you're going to get.

33:32.150 --> 33:33.279
Mm-hm.

33:33.279 --> 33:35.000
You want predictable healing

33:35.000 --> 33:36.119
to create a scar.

33:36.119 --> 33:38.039
And so then the question

33:36.119 --> 33:38.039
is going to be,

33:38.039 --> 33:40.029
is if he did want

33:38.039 --> 33:40.029
to have that done,

33:40.029 --> 33:43.009
how can you control it the way

33:43.009 --> 33:44.160
-that you're speaking about?

33:43.009 --> 33:44.160
-That's true.

33:44.160 --> 33:46.099
I don't think we're there.

33:46.099 --> 33:50.190
We are very good at making scars

33:46.099 --> 33:50.190
minimize, go away.

33:50.190 --> 33:53.259
We understand the principles

33:50.190 --> 33:53.259
behind that, okay?

33:53.259 --> 33:57.119
And I think that until

33:53.259 --> 33:57.119
this becomes

33:57.119 --> 34:02.009
more of a practiced art

33:57.119 --> 34:02.009
in this country,

34:02.009 --> 34:05.109
my view is

34:02.009 --> 34:05.109
it's too unpredictable,

34:05.109 --> 34:07.000
at least in this country.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.099
I'm used to people

34:07.000 --> 34:08.099
telling me, no,

34:08.099 --> 34:10.039
you can't do this,

34:08.099 --> 34:10.039
can't do that.

34:10.039 --> 34:12.039
But I've just always been

34:10.039 --> 34:12.039
the one to push the button

34:12.039 --> 34:13.159
and see how

34:12.039 --> 34:13.159
far I can take it.

34:13.159 --> 34:15.059
But I still want to continue

34:15.059 --> 34:17.010
to, you know, pursue

34:15.059 --> 34:17.010
that procedure.

34:17.010 --> 34:19.159
The thing that I'm really

34:17.010 --> 34:19.159
curious about

34:19.159 --> 34:23.059
is this whole nipple sucking

34:19.159 --> 34:23.059
stimulation thing

34:23.059 --> 34:24.260
that you're into.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.110
I-I-I--

34:26.110 --> 34:28.079
I'm not into the nipple

34:26.110 --> 34:28.079
amputation.

34:28.079 --> 34:30.030
I don't like my nipples touched.

SARA: This all started when

41:00.000 --> 41:01.269
I was eight years old.

41:01.269 --> 41:04.119
That's when I broke

41:01.269 --> 41:04.119
my nose in wrestling.

41:04.119 --> 41:06.280
As the years went on,

41:04.119 --> 41:06.280
I had these self-esteem issues

41:06.280 --> 41:09.289
because of my nose and I tried

41:06.280 --> 41:09.289
to get my nose fixed,

41:09.289 --> 41:12.210
but it looked

41:09.289 --> 41:12.210
a lot more crooked.

41:12.210 --> 41:14.150
So for the past five years,

41:14.150 --> 41:15.280
I've worked really, really hard

41:15.280 --> 41:18.010
to fix my

41:15.280 --> 41:18.010
self-esteem issues internally.

41:18.010 --> 41:20.199
Now, with my new nose,

41:18.010 --> 41:20.199
I finally feel

41:20.199 --> 41:23.119
like I'm glowing

41:30.230 --> 41:32.280
So nice to see you.

41:32.280 --> 41:35.139
It's such a nice day,

41:32.280 --> 41:35.139
how was the ride?

41:35.139 --> 41:37.130
Oh, my gosh,

41:35.139 --> 41:37.130
it was so beautiful.

41:37.130 --> 41:40.159
I got to just enjoy the scene.

41:37.130 --> 41:40.159
It just feels good.

41:40.159 --> 41:42.179
It feels good to be confident.

I'm feeling great.

41:44.119 --> 41:46.019
Like, I'm feeling

41:44.119 --> 41:46.019
amazing.

41:46.019 --> 41:49.000
I mean, my nose changed

41:46.019 --> 41:49.000
my appearance,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.099
but I feel like it's more than

41:49.000 --> 41:51.099
just appearance.

41:51.099 --> 41:54.130
-It changed my entire mindset.

41:51.099 --> 41:54.130
-You look so good!

41:54.130 --> 41:56.150
-I am fine!

41:54.130 --> 41:56.150
-Yes you are!

41:56.150 --> 41:58.110
[giggling]

41:58.110 --> 41:59.289
Before my surgery,

41:59.289 --> 42:02.239
I had a crooked nose and you

41:59.289 --> 42:02.239
could see up my nostrils.

42:02.239 --> 42:05.280
On top of that, I had major

42:02.239 --> 42:05.280
breathing issues and self-doubt.

42:05.280 --> 42:08.139
But now since my surgery

42:05.280 --> 42:08.139
with Dr. Nassif,

42:08.139 --> 42:09.269
my nose is much straighter,

42:09.269 --> 42:11.179
my airway is wide open.

42:11.179 --> 42:13.170
I finally have the nose

42:11.179 --> 42:13.170
I should have had.

42:13.170 --> 42:16.000
Since I was a kid, I have been

42:13.170 --> 42:16.000
wrestling with my nose,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.019
but that is a thing of the past.

42:18.019 --> 42:21.119
My nose was kind of like,

42:18.019 --> 42:21.119
something that was always, like,

42:21.119 --> 42:23.119
shadowing my shine, you know.

42:23.119 --> 42:24.260
It was

42:23.119 --> 42:24.260
like, darkening my shine

42:24.260 --> 42:27.170
and I just feel like, empowered.

42:28.190 --> 42:31.179
And this whole surgery

42:28.190 --> 42:31.179
process, like...

42:31.179 --> 42:33.280
I wouldn't have been able

42:31.179 --> 42:33.280
to do it all without you.

42:34.230 --> 42:37.230
-I'm so happy for you.

42:34.230 --> 42:37.230
-It's a new me.

42:37.230 --> 42:39.030
Going through this journey

42:37.230 --> 42:39.030
with Sara,

42:39.030 --> 42:40.230
I think we have only

42:39.030 --> 42:40.230
grown closer.

42:40.230 --> 42:43.030
Honestly, the best part

42:40.230 --> 42:43.030
about the surgery

42:43.030 --> 42:45.030
is I've always seen

42:43.030 --> 42:45.030
her as beautiful,

42:45.030 --> 42:47.150
but now she finally sees

42:45.030 --> 42:47.150
it and she's just able

42:47.150 --> 42:49.269
to live her life

42:47.150 --> 42:49.269
as she wants to.

42:49.269 --> 42:52.159
I couldn't have imagined

42:49.269 --> 42:52.159
you looking any better.

42:52.159 --> 42:54.190
Aw, thank you, sister.

42:54.190 --> 42:57.039
I've learned if you see

42:54.190 --> 42:57.039
a doctor on a billboard,

42:57.039 --> 42:59.130
don't trust it.

42:59.130 --> 43:01.039
After we eat,

42:59.130 --> 43:01.039
you want to go for a ride?

43:01.039 --> 43:02.230
Then we'll really

43:01.039 --> 43:02.230
be comin' in hot.

43:02.230 --> 43:04.280
[giggling]

43:04.280 --> 43:07.219
You crash the bike,

43:04.280 --> 43:07.219
I might have to wrestle you!

43:08.199 --> 43:11.219
If I crash the bike,

43:08.199 --> 43:11.219
Dr. Nassif'll be pissed.

43:13.039 --> 43:15.039
Can't break this pretty face.

43:15.039 --> 43:16.219
[giggling]

43:17.019 --> 43:19.269
Some people call me animated

43:17.019 --> 43:19.269
and I ----ing love it.

43:19.269 --> 43:21.199
I got 100 CC's.

43:21.199 --> 43:23.000
Without my permission.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.159
She basically had

43:23.000 --> 43:24.159
secret surgery.

43:24.159 --> 43:26.019
You're trying to look

43:26.019 --> 43:27.150
like a friggin'

43:26.019 --> 43:27.150
cartoon character,

43:27.150 --> 43:29.150
which is not what you are.

43:29.150 --> 43:31.230
Imagine going to get a nose job

43:29.150 --> 43:31.230
and not telling your mother.

43:31.230 --> 43:33.190
-You didn't tell her?

43:31.230 --> 43:33.190
-Uh-uh.

43:33.190 --> 43:34.280
It just got gradually worse.

43:34.280 --> 43:36.190
Try to fix it. It's really hard.

43:37.030 --> 43:39.139
How can I feel good when

43:37.030 --> 43:39.139
this is what I see?

43:39.139 --> 43:41.199
The implants

43:39.139 --> 43:41.199
were towards my side.

43:41.199 --> 43:43.050
I didn't tell my husband.

43:43.050 --> 43:46.179
There's a sciatic nerve.

43:43.050 --> 43:46.179
This is ----ing crazy.
