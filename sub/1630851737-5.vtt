00:08.708 --> 00:10.125
Cha-chung!

00:32.875 --> 00:34.333
-Ooph.

00:36.708 --> 00:40.333
Why not pick on someone own size?

00:40.416 --> 00:42.500
Barbarians!

00:42.583 --> 00:45.875
-Huh?

00:56.083 --> 00:57.083
Ah!

01:00.750 --> 01:01.666
Hmm?

01:03.041 --> 01:04.666
-Ah!

01:08.833 --> 01:11.166
Hola, I am Picchu.

01:11.250 --> 01:14.125
-Huh?

01:16.625 --> 01:18.083
-Kick!

01:18.166 --> 01:20.458
-I got you, little baby.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.166
-Kick!

01:24.250 --> 01:25.666
-Ha!

01:30.250 --> 01:31.750
-Gracias, guerrero.

01:32.916 --> 01:34.958
Gracias, Picchu!

01:35.041 --> 01:37.416
-Taste my ax!

01:40.750 --> 01:43.333
-Our son, fiercest of warriors!

01:43.416 --> 01:44.625
Barbarians!

01:44.708 --> 01:47.250
-Barbarians!

01:49.916 --> 01:51.083
Ew, gross.

01:51.166 --> 01:53.333
Ay, Papa. Ay, Mama.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.250
Barbarians!

02:03.000 --> 02:04.958
Who wants more of Picchu?

02:05.041 --> 02:06.208
-Huh?

02:08.750 --> 02:09.958
Worthy foe.

02:25.375 --> 02:26.750
Huh?

02:31.250 --> 02:32.083
-Oh!

02:35.833 --> 02:37.041
-Agh.

02:39.291 --> 02:42.208
You make Picchu mad!

02:42.833 --> 02:43.750
Ay?!

02:47.000 --> 02:50.833
Spare me, and I swear
you will never see me again.

02:50.916 --> 02:53.041
-Hmm.

03:02.791 --> 03:05.833
-Go. Never come back.

03:10.583 --> 03:11.458
-Ah!

03:11.541 --> 03:12.916
Battle over, son.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.333
We win.

03:14.416 --> 03:16.416
Good to show mercy, Picchu.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.791
-We… We fight for noble cause.

03:32.208 --> 03:37.250
To my brave son, Picchu,
mightiest of all barbarians!

03:37.333 --> 03:39.916
To Picchu!

03:41.333 --> 03:42.708
I love you, mijo.

03:44.875 --> 03:48.083
-Love you too, mi puma.

03:54.375 --> 03:55.666
Ew.

03:57.208 --> 03:58.041
Hm.

04:01.708 --> 04:02.583
Hmm…

04:25.458 --> 04:26.291
Ay!

04:32.333 --> 04:33.666
-Huh?

04:35.833 --> 04:38.916
-Picchu let you go.

04:39.708 --> 04:41.000
Why you do this?

04:41.083 --> 04:43.458
A scorpion wanted to cross a river.

04:43.541 --> 04:47.458
He asked for help from a frog,
but the frog refused,

04:47.541 --> 04:49.916
fearing the scorpion's sting.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.583
The scorpion promised
he would not sting the frog,

04:53.666 --> 04:55.041
so the frog agreed,

04:55.125 --> 04:58.041
allowed the scorpion onto his back,

04:58.125 --> 05:00.083
and hopped across the river.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.958
-Then the scorpion stung him.

05:04.333 --> 05:06.750
As the frog lay dying, he asked,

05:06.833 --> 05:07.666
"Why?"

05:09.833 --> 05:14.125
And the scorpion replied,
"Because I am a scorpion."

05:17.083 --> 05:20.333
Papa. Mama.

05:20.416 --> 05:24.541
Why did I conquer your people?
Because I am a warrior.

05:25.125 --> 05:29.166
Why did you show mercy?
Because you are a fool.

05:29.250 --> 05:32.041
Mercy is weakness.

05:32.125 --> 05:34.333
You do not deserve a warrior's death.

05:34.916 --> 05:39.875
You will spend the rest of your days
knowing you cursed your family.

06:18.416 --> 06:19.250
Rico!

06:19.333 --> 06:21.916
-Ooh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! Oh!
-Whoa!

06:26.916 --> 06:29.291
Whoa! Whoa!

06:34.833 --> 06:36.083
-Whoa!
-Chiapa!

06:49.833 --> 06:52.750
-Ooh! Friend.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.000
You're kind of broken, aren't you?
Mm-mm-mm. That's exactly my type.

07:01.583 --> 07:03.125
-There's our way out.
-Huh?

07:04.833 --> 07:06.416
Come on, Rico. Use some magic to--

07:08.833 --> 07:10.083
Oh-oh-oh. Okay, okay.

07:21.958 --> 07:23.166
Oh, Barbarian King?

07:23.250 --> 07:26.375
Ha! Told you someone here, daughter.

07:26.458 --> 07:29.416
Princess Maya of the Tecas?

07:29.500 --> 07:32.625
-Barbarian Princess!
-Hello, Princess Maya.

07:32.708 --> 07:36.083
Sorry you fell in booby trap
puma butt death hole.

07:36.166 --> 07:37.166
-Papa!

07:37.250 --> 07:40.708
We apologize
for dropping by unannounced,

07:40.791 --> 07:41.916
Your Majesties.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.916
Are these bones made out of clay?

07:45.541 --> 07:48.458
-Real bones start to stink after a while.

07:48.541 --> 07:52.291
Do we want this whole place
to smell like rotting meat?

07:52.375 --> 07:53.833
-No!
-Yes. Huh?

07:53.916 --> 07:57.291
-Daughter, we barbarians.
-Hmm.

07:57.375 --> 08:01.333
Barbarians like rotting meat, like blood…

08:01.416 --> 08:02.291
Uh…

08:02.375 --> 08:05.208
What else do we like?
Barbarians like to battle!

08:05.291 --> 08:07.875
Papa, I just think there's more to life

08:07.958 --> 08:09.750
-than… …battle.

08:09.833 --> 08:12.708
-You… You take that back!

08:12.791 --> 08:14.208
We're wasting time.

08:14.291 --> 08:17.125
-Daughter! Please.
-Come on, Papa.

08:17.208 --> 08:21.041
-We have to finish packing.
-Princess hurt king's feelings.

08:21.125 --> 08:24.166
You're free to go,
Princess Maya and companions.

08:25.875 --> 08:28.666
Hold on. I have something
important to tell you.

08:28.750 --> 08:32.083
The prophecy wasn't
about my father and my brothers.

08:32.166 --> 08:34.708
Yeah. That probably why brothers all dead.

08:36.875 --> 08:40.291
-Oh, that's-- that's harsh.
-Papa, that was savage.

08:40.375 --> 08:42.541
Yes. Barbarian.

08:42.625 --> 08:45.333
I know the truth about the prophecy now.

08:45.416 --> 08:49.083
I am the Great Eagle.
And I need your greatest warrior to--

08:51.375 --> 08:53.208
-Why are you packing?
-Duh.

08:53.291 --> 08:57.000
-That gods coming to kill us all.
-I thought you liked to fight.

08:57.083 --> 09:01.416
Ah, look here. Barbarians no speak good,
eh, but we not stupid.

09:01.500 --> 09:05.500
So your entire kingdom is going to die?

09:05.583 --> 09:07.416
It's the only way to survive.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.166
-The mathematics are solid.
-It's not the only way.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.250
If you want to fix things,
there's a logical solution.

09:13.333 --> 09:17.500
-Let Lord Mictlan sacrifice you.
-Boom! Everything fixed!

09:17.583 --> 09:18.750
Uh!

09:18.833 --> 09:22.708
If he sacrifices me, he'll--
he'll become even more powerful.

09:22.791 --> 09:25.583
You really want that?
He is the god of war.

09:31.333 --> 09:35.333
King love to battle,
but a more powerful god of war?

09:35.916 --> 09:36.916
Ooph.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.083
No so good.

09:38.166 --> 09:39.875
I can put a stop to this.

09:39.958 --> 09:42.083
All I need is your greatest warrior,

09:42.166 --> 09:44.916
the fiercest of all
the Golden Mountain Barbarians.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.375
-And I have heard that it's you.
-Ooh.

09:47.458 --> 09:48.541
Huh?

09:48.625 --> 09:50.500
-What?
-Look at you.

09:50.583 --> 09:53.291
Smart and strong.

09:53.375 --> 09:57.041
Oh yeah. You look like
you can tear an alpaca in half

09:57.125 --> 09:57.958
with one hand!

09:58.041 --> 09:58.875
Pfft!

09:58.958 --> 10:01.333
"Princess the greatest warrior."

10:01.416 --> 10:04.000
She not even like to battle.

10:04.083 --> 10:06.250
-I don't have time for battle.
-Argh!

10:06.333 --> 10:08.458
We got no warrior for you.

10:08.541 --> 10:11.541
-All warriors gone now.
-They're not all gone.

10:11.625 --> 10:14.500
They all gone.

10:14.583 --> 10:17.125
-Our greatest warrior is still here.
-Don't.

10:17.208 --> 10:18.875
-Don't--
-Picchu.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.333
-Picchu?
-Picchu already go through enough.

10:22.416 --> 10:24.291
Where can I find this Picchu?

10:24.375 --> 10:25.916
Mmm… Zip it.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.833
On the Cliffs of Regret.
There, he fights the mist every day.

10:30.500 --> 10:31.583
Gracias, princesa.

10:31.666 --> 10:33.458
You're welcome, Princess.

10:34.125 --> 10:36.291
Sorry. Sorry. Um, wow.

10:36.375 --> 10:38.833
Um, did you just say he fights the mist?

10:38.916 --> 10:42.375
Yes. Picchu fights the actual mist.

10:42.458 --> 10:46.500
Okay. Like, um… Like--
Like, something is in the mist?

10:46.583 --> 10:49.125
I'm just a bit confu--
I'm trying to get it.

10:50.708 --> 10:55.875
Maya, maybe… Maybe you can help Picchu.

10:57.625 --> 11:01.416
May the blood of your enemies
be milk to your young!

11:01.500 --> 11:04.666
You know what?
This is the grossest blessing ever.

11:04.750 --> 11:07.500
Yeah. Barbarians pretty gross, huh?

11:09.583 --> 11:10.541
Sorry, daughter.

11:21.625 --> 11:24.250
-You do not deserve a warrior's death.
-Huh?

11:42.583 --> 11:44.708
-Hey, you okay?

11:47.458 --> 11:50.333
-Do you think that's him?
-I-- I-- I don't know.

11:50.416 --> 11:53.500
I mean, there's probably
so many barbarians out here

11:53.583 --> 11:55.000
fighting the mist.

11:58.416 --> 11:59.875
-Hmm.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.666
-Oh, Great Puma Warrior…
-Hmm?

12:08.208 --> 12:10.625
-…will you join our quest?

12:11.208 --> 12:13.083
-Oh, hey! We come in peace.

12:14.583 --> 12:16.958
-Whoa. Magic axes?
-I can clip him.

12:17.041 --> 12:19.166
We're not here to fight you, Puma Warrior.

12:20.833 --> 12:22.541
Terebro!

12:23.541 --> 12:27.375
Come on, man. You gotta do
better than that. You're embarrassing me.

12:27.458 --> 12:29.750
Okay, all right.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.041
I'll try it.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
Fire and heat mi gente.
Let these axes be caliente.

12:39.583 --> 12:42.375
-Dang, hombre, you made of stone?

12:44.750 --> 12:47.583
He's definitely not in
a talking mood. Maya?

12:50.541 --> 12:51.416
-Eeh!

12:59.708 --> 13:01.291
-Uh, a little help here?

13:10.708 --> 13:14.166
Is pale girl a ghost?

13:21.291 --> 13:22.291
Thank you, Chimi.

13:22.375 --> 13:24.583
I had to stop him.
He was scaring the spider.

13:24.666 --> 13:26.041
Huh?

13:26.125 --> 13:28.708
Everything okay, little eight legs.

13:30.208 --> 13:32.375
We just want to talk.

13:32.458 --> 13:33.833
Picchu listen.

13:33.916 --> 13:37.250
Please no make Picchu
regret not killing you.

13:37.333 --> 13:42.458
Need brave Puma Warrior
from Barbarian Kingdom.

13:42.541 --> 13:45.291
Warrior help with Divine Gate.

13:45.375 --> 13:49.833
King and Princess say
you greatest warrior.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.125
Big. Strong.

13:52.208 --> 13:53.166
Wow.

13:53.250 --> 13:57.791
-I didn't know you were bilingual.
-Teca girl not good at convincing.

14:00.958 --> 14:03.416
We're gonna fight so many gods.
They'll try to stop us

14:03.500 --> 14:06.791
from destroying the Divine Gate,
but we have to do it to save the world,

14:06.875 --> 14:09.375
and we're probably all gonna die!

14:09.458 --> 14:11.208
Much more convincing.

14:11.291 --> 14:14.958
Push the death angle.
Yeah. That's a great selling point.

14:15.041 --> 14:18.000
-Picchu and his axes will join quest.

14:18.083 --> 14:19.625
-Really?
-Just like that?

14:19.708 --> 14:25.083
Long time now,
Picchu and axes wait for noble cause.

14:25.166 --> 14:29.166
But now mist send you to Picchu.

14:29.250 --> 14:32.208
This noble cause Picchu wait for.

14:32.750 --> 14:35.666
Picchu fight by your side,

14:35.750 --> 14:39.250
maybe die honorable warrior death.

14:39.333 --> 14:40.833
Mm-hmm.

14:40.916 --> 14:43.125
See, we were all kind of seeing

14:43.208 --> 14:45.875
the "probably gonna die" part
as a negative.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.375
Picchu not fear death.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.666
Because death is beautiful.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.458
Death is beautiful?

14:52.541 --> 14:56.333
Gold has value because it's rare.
Life has value because it's short.

14:56.416 --> 14:58.958
Death gives life value.

14:59.041 --> 15:02.625
Bone girl smart. Picchu get ready now.

15:03.791 --> 15:07.333
Um, Maya. Yeah, come here.
This guy's nuts! He's nuts!

15:07.416 --> 15:09.708
Like, sure, he has magic axes,

15:09.791 --> 15:12.541
but is he gonna
murder us all in our sleep? Hm?

15:12.625 --> 15:14.416
-Wow.
-And how do we know for sure

15:14.500 --> 15:17.416
-he's really the Puma Warrior?

15:25.916 --> 15:28.375
-Your chest, it's--

15:28.500 --> 15:29.916
Impressive.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.416
Mm-hmm. You know, some women
like more of a… a narrow, pinched chest.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.625
Yeah, yeah. Like mine.
I mean, that's what I heard.

15:38.708 --> 15:42.791
That proves it.
You really are the Puma Warrior!

15:42.875 --> 15:46.000
-My parents are not gonna believe this.

15:46.083 --> 15:49.833
She's done it!
She found all three warriors!

15:50.458 --> 15:53.791
Ooh. I'm really craving
some goat stew and sweet ants.

15:53.875 --> 15:56.041
Huh? Uh-oh.

15:56.125 --> 15:58.125
We're gonna need a bigger pyramid.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.000
Ah, that-- That was a long bath.

16:02.083 --> 16:03.458
Like, really long.

16:03.541 --> 16:05.166
Hmm, seems fine to me.

16:05.250 --> 16:06.208
Me too.

16:08.458 --> 16:09.416
Huh?

16:15.541 --> 16:20.291
I am Maya, princess of the Tecas,
Great Eagle from the prophecy.

16:20.375 --> 16:21.791
I'm Chimi.

16:22.666 --> 16:23.791
Uh…

16:23.875 --> 16:28.500
Chimi, cursed Skull Warrior,
outcast of the Jungle Lands.

16:31.666 --> 16:34.125
-I'm Rico.

16:34.208 --> 16:37.208
Yep. Magic Rooster Wizard
of the Luna Island.

16:38.625 --> 16:40.000
-Ah!

16:40.083 --> 16:42.291
-You're supposed to just tap it!
-Hm.

16:43.625 --> 16:45.250
I am Picchu.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Okay. We go now. Follow Picchu.

16:51.791 --> 16:55.208
Also, uh, tell Picchu which way to go.

16:55.291 --> 16:57.250
We go to Teca to join my parents,

16:57.333 --> 17:00.166
then will we all destroy
the Divine Gate together.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.083
That way.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.750
And by that way,
I meant that way.

17:05.666 --> 17:08.291
Maya and the Three are ready.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.666
Onward!

17:25.250 --> 17:26.916
-Steady.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.875
-Picchu, no, no!

17:31.958 --> 17:34.291
-Ah! Huh?
-He's with us.

17:37.458 --> 17:38.708
I missed you too.

17:38.791 --> 17:39.750
Whoa!

17:39.833 --> 17:41.125
You know giant cat?

17:41.208 --> 17:44.333
-Yes. Chiapa's my friend. He protects me.

17:44.416 --> 17:47.291
Look more like you protect him.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.625
He had a bad time in the last battle.

17:49.708 --> 17:51.916
-He's working through some things.

17:53.166 --> 17:56.791
-Picchu understand Chiapa.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.583
He's always been brave.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.291
But he shows more bravery than ever now.

18:07.375 --> 18:11.000
Because even though he's afraid,
he's brave enough to keep trying.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.583
Rico understand Chiapa.

18:15.583 --> 18:16.583
-Man!

18:16.666 --> 18:19.333
What'd I ever do to you?
Huh? Giant cats be crazy.

18:28.791 --> 18:30.875
Chimi want to ride Picchu?

18:30.958 --> 18:31.958
Uh, say what now?

18:32.041 --> 18:32.958
Arf?

18:33.541 --> 18:35.000
Uh, like Chiapa.

19:03.125 --> 19:07.541
Oh no. Then-- Then what you do, Chimi?

19:08.166 --> 19:10.708
I tried to save my animal family.

19:10.791 --> 19:14.500
So the Jungle King
really did take away everything?

19:15.875 --> 19:17.958
And now you just have nothing?

19:18.541 --> 19:19.958
I have the darkness,

19:20.041 --> 19:22.583
the cold, the screaming void of despair.

19:22.666 --> 19:24.625
My sole companion is death.

19:24.708 --> 19:26.416
Well, death and this spider.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.500
Nope, just death.

19:34.750 --> 19:35.666
Oh.

19:35.750 --> 19:38.375
And that's why you wanna
meet the goddess of death.

19:38.458 --> 19:40.958
My mother died
as I was coming into the world.

19:41.041 --> 19:43.916
-The greatest tragedy of my life and hers

19:44.875 --> 19:45.708
was my birth.

19:46.583 --> 19:49.500
I want the goddess of death
to introduce me to my mother.

19:49.583 --> 19:53.041
I guess… I just want to apologize to her

19:54.083 --> 19:55.250
for being born.

19:56.041 --> 19:57.875
Ay.

20:03.166 --> 20:06.708
This is the most I've ever talked
to anyone in my life. I don't like it.

20:06.791 --> 20:09.666
-How do you do it?
-The key is not to listen to yourself.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.166
-So, Chimi,

20:12.250 --> 20:14.458
um, at least you have a tree, right?

20:15.041 --> 20:16.916
They left Rico with nothing

20:17.000 --> 20:19.833
just because he made
one little mistake as a kid.

20:19.916 --> 20:22.416
-I deserve to be left with nothing.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.750
-Huh?
-Look, I had nothing

20:24.833 --> 20:27.041
before the Gran Brujo.

20:27.125 --> 20:30.458
Look, he found me.
I lived on the streets eating garbage.

20:30.541 --> 20:32.833
My only friend was a dead raccoon.

20:32.916 --> 20:36.583
Made my clothes out of mud,
and then the goats, they ate 'em.

20:36.666 --> 20:38.333
Look, I hate goats.

20:38.416 --> 20:42.166
Gran Brujo took me in, gave me food,

20:42.750 --> 20:43.958
a roof over my head.

20:44.833 --> 20:45.916
He believed in me.

20:46.791 --> 20:47.750
Then one day, I…

20:49.000 --> 20:52.166
I killed him with forbidden Peasant Magic.

20:54.458 --> 20:55.291
I'm sorry.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.583
The only thing I had
to remember the Gran Brujo by was Estefan.

21:02.583 --> 21:03.875
And now he's broken.

21:03.958 --> 21:04.875
Just like me.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.000
You still have cool hair.

21:08.625 --> 21:09.458
True that.

21:19.041 --> 21:23.166
So, Picchu, fighting the mist, huh?

21:23.250 --> 21:25.000
Oh, what's the deal with that?

21:27.041 --> 21:27.958
Picchu?

21:36.041 --> 21:39.041
You do not deserve a warrior's death.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.500
-Are you okay?

21:45.083 --> 21:47.500
Picchu family gone forever,

21:47.583 --> 21:50.458
all because Picchu show mercy.

21:51.375 --> 21:56.875
Now nothing left for Picchu
but die warrior death.

21:57.666 --> 22:00.708
Then be with family again.

22:02.958 --> 22:04.166
Oh.

22:04.250 --> 22:08.291
Just wondering, you're not actually
planning to get yourself killed, are you?

22:08.375 --> 22:11.791
-No. Picchu die warrior death.

22:11.875 --> 22:13.416
Never give up.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.625
Fight till the end.

22:16.291 --> 22:20.750
Maybe live for cause. Maybe die for cause.

22:20.833 --> 22:24.708
Sometimes when you fight, maybe you die.

22:24.791 --> 22:27.916
Die so friends live.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.750
That okay.

22:29.833 --> 22:31.750
Give life value.

22:31.833 --> 22:33.750
Like bone girl say.

22:33.833 --> 22:35.375
No one's going to die.

22:35.958 --> 22:36.791
Maya's right.

22:36.875 --> 22:40.708
Look, we will fight side by side
and live to tell about it.

22:41.291 --> 22:43.791
And I'll make the G-- Gran Brujo proud.

22:43.875 --> 22:45.708
And I'll get to meet my mother.

22:45.791 --> 22:47.625
And Picchu maybe die a little?

22:47.708 --> 22:49.250
That's my ma--

22:49.333 --> 22:50.166
-Ow!

22:54.291 --> 22:56.583
We all have purpose now…

22:57.083 --> 23:00.458
uh, to destroy the Divine Gate,
and-- and save the world.

23:00.541 --> 23:01.375
Yeah!

23:03.875 --> 23:08.500
Each finger is weak, but together,
we shall make a mighty fist of fury.

23:08.583 --> 23:09.916
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

23:10.541 --> 23:13.333
It's a mission for us all…
n-not just for me.

23:14.125 --> 23:15.625
Yeah?

23:22.916 --> 23:27.416
So, um, so, hey, you know, now that
we've heard everyone's totally true story

23:27.500 --> 23:30.458
where they're not lying except…
Oh, Chiapa.

23:30.541 --> 23:33.250
Chiapa, why don't you tell them
about yourself?

23:59.708 --> 24:03.083
The saddest story Picchu ever hear.

24:03.166 --> 24:06.333
That part about the huitlacoche
and the two birds was funny though.

24:09.958 --> 24:13.666
-You, noble bones girl.
-What did you call me?

24:13.750 --> 24:17.291
What you do good? Maya fight good.

24:17.375 --> 24:21.416
Scrawny boy do magic good, talk too much.

24:21.500 --> 24:25.916
Scrawny? It's Rico, thank you.
And you know what? I don't talk too much.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.500
-No-- No one's ever--
-Giant cat have giant teeth.

24:30.958 --> 24:33.625
What skull girl do good?

24:45.125 --> 24:47.333
-What?
-Go stand over there.

24:52.708 --> 24:56.208
Noble bones girl true artista.

24:56.916 --> 25:00.166
Thank you. And if you call me noble again,
I'll shoot you in the heart.

25:05.291 --> 25:06.541
Hmm.

25:07.125 --> 25:08.041
Hmm.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.000
But first I need my arrows back.

25:11.083 --> 25:12.791
Oh, oh, oh, right, right.

25:21.833 --> 25:24.791
My brothers,
I hope you can hear me.

25:25.791 --> 25:31.000
These warriors, they're my friends,
and I-- I'm-- I lied to them.

25:31.083 --> 25:33.625
And I'm probably
leading them to their doom.

25:33.708 --> 25:35.875
-But I must avenge you.

25:35.958 --> 25:38.166
Am I-- Am I doing the right thing?

25:40.208 --> 25:41.583
Brothers?

25:44.000 --> 25:46.666
-No, Maya. It's me.
-You!

25:50.041 --> 25:52.291
How dare you sneak up on me?

25:52.375 --> 25:54.041
-Sneak up on you?

25:54.125 --> 25:55.833
I was in front of you. Huh?

25:55.916 --> 25:58.416
Yeah, well, we can't all
see in the dark, bat eyes.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.083
Huh. You're pretty good.

26:04.166 --> 26:07.333
Hm. I'm gonna use Eagle Claw to kill you.

26:07.416 --> 26:10.125
Yeah? Well, Crimson Moon won't let you.

26:12.208 --> 26:13.500
-Huh?

26:23.875 --> 26:26.291
Why are we fighting?

26:26.375 --> 26:28.333
-Because I hate you.

26:35.208 --> 26:36.708
-Ooph!

26:44.666 --> 26:46.458
-Hi-ya!

27:11.166 --> 27:12.500
-Ooph!

27:12.583 --> 27:15.875
-And so it ends.

27:18.208 --> 27:21.833
No fair!
You have an unfair advantage.

27:21.916 --> 27:23.708
I'm only half god too, Maya.

27:23.791 --> 27:26.000
-My mother was human.
-She was?

27:26.083 --> 27:29.291
You and I both bridge the two worlds.

27:29.375 --> 27:31.791
Please, Maya. May I ask you again?

27:31.875 --> 27:35.541
Will you help my father
and I destroy Lord Mictlan?

27:35.625 --> 27:38.833
I am the Eagle Warrior
of the Teca prophecy.

27:38.916 --> 27:41.791
-I can do it without you.
-You can't. You need us.

27:41.875 --> 27:45.750
I have what I need.
I have the three prophecy warriors who--

27:45.833 --> 27:50.166
Warriors you have been lying to.
Warriors who might pay with their lives.

27:50.250 --> 27:52.583
So what? We're going through that gate.

27:52.666 --> 27:56.875
Together, we will kill Lord Mictlan.
And I will have my revenge.

27:56.958 --> 27:58.750
-Is that true, Maya?

27:58.833 --> 28:02.333
-You're taking us through the gate.
-To kill the god of war?

28:04.375 --> 28:07.666
Greetings, Rico, Chimi, Picchu.

28:07.750 --> 28:09.625
Greetings, spooky weirdo.

28:09.708 --> 28:13.250
Picchu no like one-eye pretty boy.

28:13.333 --> 28:15.041
Too fancy.

28:16.750 --> 28:17.583
Um…

28:18.125 --> 28:19.458
Oh… H-Hey.

28:19.958 --> 28:23.583
Well, you clearly have…
…things to discuss.

28:23.666 --> 28:26.916
I should go.
Please, consider my offer, Maya.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.708
I know what you think of the gods,
but we're not all monsters.

28:32.708 --> 28:35.458
You know that is exactly
what a monster would do, right?

28:36.916 --> 28:41.000
Be well,
Princess Maya. I'll see you soon.

28:41.083 --> 28:45.458
-Anyway, hi. Are you guys mad?

29:05.750 --> 29:09.958
This whole time,
you've been lying to all of us!

29:10.041 --> 29:14.000
Look, you told me we were going to destroy
the Divine Gate, not go through it!

29:14.083 --> 29:18.750
Technically, I told Chimi
I'd introduce her to the goddess of death.

29:18.833 --> 29:21.500
How else do you think
she'd get to meet her?

29:21.583 --> 29:23.291
-That's not better.

29:23.375 --> 29:26.000
I opened up to you,
and you told me nothing but lies.

29:27.458 --> 29:30.083
This is what I get
for ever trusting a human.

29:33.375 --> 29:36.833
Now Picchu know what Teca girl is good at.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.541
Lying.

29:38.625 --> 29:42.333
Okay, yes, I lied.
But together, we're invincible.

29:42.416 --> 29:45.208
We're… We're the warriors of the prophecy.

29:45.291 --> 29:46.791
Can't you see that?

29:50.041 --> 29:53.000
Picchu still in for mission.

29:53.083 --> 29:56.041
To fight is a noble cause.

29:56.125 --> 29:58.208
But we not friends.

29:58.291 --> 29:59.333
I'm still in too.

29:59.416 --> 30:03.333
I don't have to like you to fight
for my redemption. Liar.

30:05.291 --> 30:10.416
-Do I still meet the goddess of death?
-Unfortunately, yeah, I think we're gonna.

30:10.500 --> 30:14.958
Then I'll do it. For me.
Not for you, serpent tongue.

30:23.708 --> 30:25.750
-That not good.

30:25.833 --> 30:27.958
-Oh no! Teca!

30:28.958 --> 30:30.416
My parents!
