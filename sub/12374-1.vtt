02:43.510 --> 02:45.637
That's a big fella! Whoa!

03:13.625 --> 03:15.668
- Looks great.
- Thank you.

03:16.002 --> 03:17.921
Happy vacation, honey.

03:19.339 --> 03:21.966
Manchurian tung oil!
Where did you get this?

03:22.300 --> 03:23.968
Helen got it for me in Oslo.

03:24.052 --> 03:27.805
There's enough here
to do the whole table and the bureau.

03:30.266 --> 03:32.185
I wonder what this could be.

03:32.268 --> 03:34.646
Oh, honey, you got it. Thank you.

03:34.729 --> 03:36.940
Enough to do the entire guest room.

03:37.023 --> 03:39.400
I'm so glad we're spending
our vacation at home.

03:39.484 --> 03:42.362
- I'm gonna get started now.
- Where are you going?

03:46.407 --> 03:48.535
- I'll get it.
- Be my guest.

03:53.248 --> 03:55.500
- Maybe you should get it.
- I'll go.

04:01.881 --> 04:03.132
Oh, no!

04:09.056 --> 04:10.224
Jane.

04:12.268 --> 04:14.186
It's your turn, honey.

04:27.032 --> 04:29.160
- Good luck, honey.
- Thanks.

04:31.370 --> 04:34.456
Hi, Barbara. I'm glad I caught you.
Heard you were on vacation.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.041
That's right. Complete vacation.

04:36.125 --> 04:37.918
Today I'm $260,000!

04:40.004 --> 04:42.965
- It's 6:45 in the morning.
- This offer is real.

04:43.048 --> 04:46.468
From a man in New York City
who only saw a photograph.

04:46.552 --> 04:49.305
Jane, don't send people photos
of our house.

04:49.388 --> 04:53.642
He wants to bring the wife and family
here for some peace and quiet.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.519
That's what we're looking for.

04:55.603 --> 05:00.025
This house is too big for you.
It ought to be for a couple with kids.

05:01.818 --> 05:05.155
I didn't mean anything.
But this house is too big.

05:05.572 --> 05:09.075
- I'll see you in a few weeks. Okay?
- Think about it.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.883
I was telling Barbara about this offer
on the house...

05:24.966 --> 05:26.009
No, Jane.

05:33.975 --> 05:35.894
Come with me to the store.

05:35.977 --> 05:39.231
- What for?
- I need a new brush for the tung oil.

05:39.689 --> 05:43.610
- And I want to get a part for the model.
- Just run in, okay?

06:02.129 --> 06:05.049
Two weeks at home. The perfect vacation.

06:05.591 --> 06:09.303
Jane says we should sell the house
to someone with a family.

06:09.387 --> 06:12.348
I don't think it's any of Jane's business.

06:12.890 --> 06:15.977
Besides, we could try again
on this vacation.

06:16.394 --> 06:18.479
Really? What are you saying?

06:35.705 --> 06:38.374
- How are you doing, Ernie?
- Hi, how are you?

06:47.593 --> 06:48.802
Good morning, Adam.

06:48.886 --> 06:51.471
- Need a haircut before your vacation?
- No, thanks, Bill.

06:51.555 --> 06:53.223
- How's the model coming?
- Great.

06:53.307 --> 06:57.478
You know, Bozman built that foundation
in 1835. His grandson...

07:07.905 --> 07:10.908
He's got hair down
to his goddamn shoulders.

07:11.408 --> 07:14.203
He says to me, "Just trim it a little."

07:14.620 --> 07:17.915
- I took the scissors to him so fast...
- See you later.

07:32.304 --> 07:35.974
- This will be great.
- Wouldn't you rather go to Jamaica?

07:36.475 --> 07:39.771
- No way. There's no place like home.
- Look out for that...

08:24.816 --> 08:27.152
Perfect start to our vacation.

08:27.318 --> 08:29.904
You'll feel better when you're dry.

08:31.866 --> 08:34.618
That fire wasn't burning when we left.

08:35.703 --> 08:38.998
- How's your arm?
- I don't know. It feels frozen.

08:56.390 --> 08:59.185
I'll make some coffee
and you get wood for the fire.

08:59.268 --> 09:02.062
Maybe we should take things extra slow.

09:02.146 --> 09:04.940
Do you remember how
we got back up here?

09:06.859 --> 09:10.279
I'm going back to that bridge
and retrace our steps.

09:25.086 --> 09:26.838
- You saved my...
- Two hours!

09:26.922 --> 09:30.342
- You won't believe... What?
- That's how long you were gone.

09:31.593 --> 09:34.429
- What is going on?
- I have to show you something.

09:35.972 --> 09:37.140
Look.

09:45.106 --> 09:46.608
There's that.

09:47.108 --> 09:48.819
And there's that.

09:56.409 --> 09:59.704
- "Handbook for the Recently Diseased."
- Deceased.

10:02.290 --> 10:03.625
Deceased.

10:03.875 --> 10:07.504
I don't know where it came from.
Look at the publisher.

10:11.508 --> 10:14.469
"Handbook for
the Recently Deceased Press."

10:14.970 --> 10:18.391
You know what?
I don't think we survived the crash.

10:22.812 --> 10:24.230
I hate this.

10:24.313 --> 10:26.482
Can you give me the basics?

10:27.441 --> 10:30.444
This book isn't arranged that way.
What do you want to know?

10:30.528 --> 10:33.948
Why did you disappear
when you stepped off the porch?

10:34.031 --> 10:36.576
Are we halfway to heaven
or halfway to hell?

10:36.659 --> 10:38.661
How long will this last?

10:38.744 --> 10:41.038
I don't see anything about heaven or hell.

10:41.122 --> 10:44.083
This book reads like stereo instructions.
Listen.

10:44.167 --> 10:46.127
"Geographical and Temporal Perimeters.

10:46.210 --> 10:49.839
"Functional perimeters vary from
manifestation to manifestation."

10:51.424 --> 10:53.634
This is going to take some time.

11:16.950 --> 11:19.745
Damn sandworms. Thirteen percent, huh?

11:20.120 --> 11:23.457
I better find a job.
Let's see. Business section.

11:29.546 --> 11:32.174
What do we got here? The Maitlands.

11:34.176 --> 11:37.054
Cute couple. Look nice and stupid, too.

11:44.269 --> 11:46.897
I wish I had a better view
of the cemetery from here.

11:46.980 --> 11:49.983
I can't tell which is
the best placement for us.

11:55.405 --> 11:56.865
Cabin fever?

11:57.282 --> 11:59.243
I can't clean anything properly.

11:59.326 --> 12:02.120
The vacuum's in the garage
and we can't leave the house.

12:02.204 --> 12:05.750
Why don't they tell us something?
Where are the other dead people?

12:05.834 --> 12:07.961
Why is it just you and me?

12:08.711 --> 12:10.588
Maybe this is heaven.

12:11.297 --> 12:14.050
In heaven there wouldn't be dust
on everything.

12:22.684 --> 12:23.977
It's Jane.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.566
- What's she doing here?
- I don't know.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.526
Jane, up here. Jane!

12:37.866 --> 12:39.951
She can't see you, right?

12:42.579 --> 12:46.541
In the book, rule number two:
"The living usually won't see the dead."

12:48.168 --> 12:50.920
- Won't or can't?
- It just says "won't."

12:51.004 --> 12:54.966
God, this book is so stupid!
I can't understand anything in it.

12:56.259 --> 12:57.803
Barb, honey...

12:58.512 --> 13:00.055
...we're dead.

13:00.347 --> 13:03.684
I don't think we have much
to worry about anymore.

13:36.467 --> 13:39.470
This is great!
Just what the doctor ordered.

13:45.684 --> 13:47.186
Sorry, ma'am.

13:49.271 --> 13:51.399
Delia Deetz, welcome home.

13:52.859 --> 13:54.152
Charles!

13:54.653 --> 13:59.241
It's okay, there's no damage. See?
Good, sturdy, country craftsmanship.

13:59.783 --> 14:03.912
Look at that kitchen. You'll finally
be able to cook a decent meal.

14:06.790 --> 14:08.500
Come and have a look.

14:17.551 --> 14:20.554
A little gasoline. Blowtorch. No problem.

14:21.721 --> 14:23.723
Excuse me. Here we go.

14:34.985 --> 14:37.320
We'll have to rip out all the plumbing.

14:37.404 --> 14:40.532
Other than that, it's perfect. Just perfect.

14:41.658 --> 14:44.620
- What do you think, honey?
- Delia hates it.

14:48.291 --> 14:49.750
I could live here.

14:50.001 --> 14:51.669
Careful! That's my sculpture.

14:51.752 --> 14:54.964
I don't mean "my" as in "I bought it."
I mean I made it.

14:57.008 --> 14:58.843
Put it on the table.

15:07.185 --> 15:10.271
Ten minutes. I'm already perfectly at ease.

15:11.189 --> 15:12.607
It's perfect.

15:12.690 --> 15:13.858
Help!

15:14.775 --> 15:16.152
It's Otho.

15:16.694 --> 15:19.655
Otho, why don't you come
in the front door?

15:20.031 --> 15:21.449
It's bad luck.

15:21.532 --> 15:24.452
You left the city for me. I am so happy.

15:24.827 --> 15:26.579
Of course you are.

15:29.248 --> 15:31.417
Let's get one thing straight.

15:31.501 --> 15:35.463
We're here to enjoy the country setting,
not to trash the place!

15:35.546 --> 15:38.175
Charles, you're lucky
the yuppies are buying condos...

15:38.258 --> 15:42.387
...so you can afford what I'm going
to have to do to this place.

15:42.679 --> 15:46.934
I'm here to relax and clip coupons,
and, damn it, I mean to do it.

15:47.184 --> 15:49.811
Then go do it quietly, dear,
and let Otho and me think.

15:49.895 --> 15:52.022
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?

15:52.105 --> 15:53.982
Is this a punishment?

15:55.192 --> 15:56.902
What are we going to do?

15:57.778 --> 16:00.113
We're not completely helpless.

16:00.405 --> 16:04.618
I've been reading that book and there's
a word for people in our situation.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.411
Ghosts!

16:07.788 --> 16:10.207
Let's get this show on the road.

16:13.460 --> 16:15.838
We're dealing with
negative entertainment potential.

16:15.921 --> 16:18.757
There's absolutely no organic flow through.

16:18.841 --> 16:21.760
I noticed that, too.
It's like a giant ant farm.

16:24.888 --> 16:27.391
- What?
- I thought I saw something.

16:38.862 --> 16:40.697
You've read my mind.

16:41.364 --> 16:44.284
- I did?
- So few clients are able to read my mind.

16:44.367 --> 16:46.953
They're not open to the experience.

16:55.086 --> 16:56.337
My God!

16:57.046 --> 17:01.176
We just have to pray the other closets
are bigger than this one.

17:01.509 --> 17:02.677
Look!

17:03.678 --> 17:05.430
Ozzie and Harriet.

17:08.016 --> 17:09.767
- What happened to these people?
- They died.

17:09.851 --> 17:11.935
Look, an indoor outhouse.

17:17.192 --> 17:20.361
- Viridian.
- Viridian. Why do I know that name?

17:20.862 --> 17:22.280
Blue-green!

17:23.031 --> 17:25.034
Hydrated chromic oxide.

17:25.409 --> 17:28.913
Remember, I'm schooled in chemistry.
I was a hair analyst.

17:28.996 --> 17:30.581
- What?
- Briefly.

17:36.545 --> 17:38.672
Deliver me from L.L. Bean.

17:41.091 --> 17:44.720
I know what you two are up to and
you're not going to get away with it!

17:44.803 --> 17:46.430
This is not working out.

17:46.514 --> 17:50.559
I will not stop living and breathing art
just because you need to relax.

17:51.185 --> 17:53.812
I'm here with you. I'll live with you
in this hellhole.

17:53.896 --> 17:58.651
But I must express myself. If I can't
gut this house and make it my own...

17:59.235 --> 18:02.321
...I will go insane
and I will take you with me!

18:04.532 --> 18:08.160
Yeah. Well, maybe the house
could use a little remodeling.

18:08.244 --> 18:11.664
But why don't you just leave
this room alone, okay?

18:12.998 --> 18:13.916
Okay.

18:19.798 --> 18:21.216
I'll get her.

18:22.050 --> 18:22.926
So?

18:23.009 --> 18:27.681
Once you cover the wallpaper, knock down
a few walls, this place might be livable.

18:27.764 --> 18:30.559
- What's on the third floor?
- Attic space.

18:30.642 --> 18:33.061
I forgot to lock the attic door.

18:40.819 --> 18:42.863
- Did you feel something?
- When?

18:52.080 --> 18:55.041
- You don't have a key?
- Maybe Charles does.

18:55.208 --> 18:59.504
I have a feeling there's something
very interesting behind this door.

18:59.588 --> 19:03.425
Yeah, the ghosts of the people who died
in this house, and they want us out!

19:03.508 --> 19:05.427
Let's do them a favor.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.322
My God, that was close!

19:26.199 --> 19:28.034
I cannot watch this.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.746
What's the good of being a ghost
if you can't frighten people away?

19:31.829 --> 19:34.457
- Honey?
- No, I'm not putting up with this!

19:44.550 --> 19:47.386
- You don't know what's out there.
- I don't care.

19:56.437 --> 19:57.730
Barbara!

19:58.314 --> 19:59.357
Adam!

20:00.900 --> 20:03.528
Adam, help. I'm getting all yellow!

20:44.403 --> 20:47.364
We're trapped in this house
with those people.

20:52.411 --> 20:56.248
I can't believe we're eating Cantonese.
Is there no Szechwan up here?

20:56.331 --> 20:59.794
I plan to have a stroke from the amount
of MSG in this food.

21:00.044 --> 21:04.924
This is our first meal in this house,
so let's try to make it a pleasant one.

21:06.217 --> 21:08.219
Don't bait your mother.

21:08.469 --> 21:12.098
When we get settled, we'll build you
a darkroom in the basement.

21:12.473 --> 21:14.726
My whole life is a darkroom.

21:15.476 --> 21:17.228
One big dark room.

21:19.147 --> 21:23.902
You were miserable in New York City,
and you'll be miserable in the sticks.

21:24.027 --> 21:25.904
At least someone's life
hasn't been upheaved.

21:25.987 --> 21:30.617
I'm happy here. Those people in New York
don't know what they're missing.

21:35.038 --> 21:37.790
We could become The Summer Art Center
of New York.

21:37.874 --> 21:40.752
I could start sculpting again.
I'm only truly happy when I'm sculpting.

21:40.835 --> 21:44.506
That's a very good idea.
That'll be very time-consuming.

21:45.048 --> 21:47.383
First the house.
Otho and I have great plans.

21:47.467 --> 21:49.469
We should keep it the way it is.

21:49.552 --> 21:50.929
Good idea.

21:56.101 --> 21:59.480
The furniture truck is coming.
We must decide what goes and what stays.

21:59.563 --> 22:02.566
Everything goes,
along with whatever's in the attic.

22:20.209 --> 22:21.502
Careful.

22:21.752 --> 22:25.506
Tell me what you do and I'll tell you
why my husband will fire you.

22:26.924 --> 22:29.510
- Isn't there an index?
- No, nothing.

22:31.762 --> 22:33.222
What's this?

22:39.270 --> 22:42.064
Do you know where that's going?
Did anyone tell you where...

22:42.147 --> 22:45.026
Why are there only three sculptures?
There were four sculptures.

22:45.110 --> 22:47.279
Where's the fourth sculpture?

22:47.362 --> 22:49.156
What are you doing?

22:54.536 --> 22:57.873
"Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist.
Troubled by the living?

22:57.956 --> 23:00.500
"Is death a problem and not the solution?
Unhappy with eternity?

23:00.584 --> 23:03.753
"Having difficulty adjusting?
Call Betelgeuse."

23:07.132 --> 23:09.342
There's no number or instructions?

23:09.426 --> 23:12.512
Nothing. The "bio-exorcist." I don't get it.

23:16.975 --> 23:18.518
Straight back.

23:20.729 --> 23:23.732
Why don't you take a break
for half an hour?

23:44.587 --> 23:46.088
Put that down!

23:46.172 --> 23:48.049
What the hell are you doing?

23:48.132 --> 23:50.009
- Listen to me!
- Jesus!

23:51.677 --> 23:55.097
Why are you doing this to me?
This is my art and it is dangerous.

23:55.181 --> 23:57.517
Do you think I want to die like this?

24:12.031 --> 24:13.741
Hi. How are you?

24:22.708 --> 24:24.752
That little girl saw us.

24:25.253 --> 24:27.672
- Nobody can see us.
- But she did.

24:30.216 --> 24:32.970
- What happened to the previous owners?
- They drowned.

24:33.053 --> 24:35.973
Yes, they were family. I was devastated.

24:36.098 --> 24:38.475
- Here, take that.
- Is this the key to the attic?

24:38.559 --> 24:42.646
That's a skeleton key that will open
any door. Give that to your father.

24:43.230 --> 24:46.859
You might mention I single-handedly
decorated that house.

24:46.942 --> 24:50.737
If he needs any advice in that arena
have him come see me.

25:11.300 --> 25:13.385
Don't worry. I locked the door.

25:31.112 --> 25:35.408
Having trouble with the living?
Tired of having your home violated?

25:35.492 --> 25:37.410
Want to get rid of them
pesky living critters?

25:37.494 --> 25:41.456
Well, come on down and see me,
the afterlife's leading bio-exorcist.

25:41.539 --> 25:44.959
Yes, sirree! I want to tell you,
I'll do anything!

25:47.629 --> 25:51.716
I'll scare 'em real bad.
I'll do anything to get your business.

25:51.925 --> 25:54.677
Hell! I'll possess myself if I gotta!

25:55.136 --> 25:58.056
Yo! I got demons runnin' all through me.

25:58.681 --> 26:00.642
Come on down and see it.

26:00.725 --> 26:03.937
If you act now, you get a free
demon possession with every exorcism.

26:04.020 --> 26:05.980
You can't beat that, can you?

26:06.064 --> 26:10.944
Bring the little partners. We've got plenty
of snakes for them to play with.

26:11.528 --> 26:15.615
Say it once, say it twice,
third time's a charm. And remember...

26:15.698 --> 26:19.119
"I'll eat anything you want me to eat.
Swallow anything you want me to swallow.

26:19.203 --> 26:21.831
"So, come on down, I'll chew on the dog."

26:50.359 --> 26:54.697
We need some help. I read something
in this book about emergencies.

26:55.531 --> 26:58.784
Here it is.
"In case of emergency, draw a door."

27:03.664 --> 27:07.585
"Draw a door"? I don't know why
we keep looking in that stupid book.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.966
Maybe we should try that Beetle guy.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.526
You didn't actually think
that would work, did you?

27:34.196 --> 27:35.947
"Knock three times."

28:38.261 --> 28:39.554
Birdies!

28:48.354 --> 28:49.605
Get it!

28:50.439 --> 28:51.482
Dad?

28:51.899 --> 28:55.152
- Can't you see I'm relaxing?
- I want to tell you what I saw.

28:55.236 --> 28:58.991
What is the point of my coming here
if you people won't let me relax?

28:59.074 --> 29:00.993
Pumpkin, sweetheart...

29:02.119 --> 29:04.079
...go help your mother.

29:04.163 --> 29:07.207
Maybe you can relax in a haunted house,
but I can't.

29:12.588 --> 29:14.381
Hmm, nice building.

29:14.506 --> 29:16.550
Bad roof. Good parking.

29:48.457 --> 29:50.459
- Adam?
- This way, honey.

30:02.805 --> 30:04.807
You don't have an appointment.

30:04.891 --> 30:07.101
- We didn't know how to make one.
- Appointment for what?

30:07.185 --> 30:09.187
- What do you want?
- Help?

30:09.270 --> 30:13.233
Already? Just bit the big one
two months ago and you want help.

30:13.316 --> 30:15.568
What does that have to do with anything?

30:15.652 --> 30:18.780
You'll use up all your help vouchers: D-90s.

30:19.531 --> 30:22.617
You spend 125 years on earth
in that house...

30:23.117 --> 30:27.413
...during which you get only three class-one
D-90 intercessions with Juno.

30:27.497 --> 30:30.416
You probably haven't read through
the manual completely yet.

30:30.500 --> 30:33.461
You'll have to wait if you don't have
an appointment.

30:33.545 --> 30:37.131
- An appointment with whom?
- For Juno, your caseworker.

30:41.219 --> 30:43.513
Number 54,000,601. Ferndock!

31:50.415 --> 31:52.918
- Want a cigarette?
- No, thank you.

31:54.211 --> 31:56.505
I'm trying to cut down myself.

32:13.688 --> 32:16.566
Adam, is this what happens when you die?

32:17.526 --> 32:19.778
This is what happens when you die.

32:19.861 --> 32:23.114
That is what happens when he dies.
And that is what happens when they die.

32:23.198 --> 32:26.243
It's all very personal.
I'll tell you something.

32:26.326 --> 32:30.497
If I knew then what I know now,
I wouldn't have had my little accident.

32:36.170 --> 32:38.089
Maitland. Party of two.

32:38.172 --> 32:40.758
Take the handbook
and go to the sixth door.

32:40.842 --> 32:43.010
Oh, we forgot our handbook.

32:47.348 --> 32:48.349
Come on.

32:54.188 --> 32:57.733
All new arrivals,
report to waiting room number eight.

33:00.236 --> 33:02.947
Flight 409 is arriving at gate three.

33:04.073 --> 33:06.617
How do I look?
There are no mirrors on this side.

33:06.701 --> 33:08.578
- You look fine.
- Fine.

33:09.036 --> 33:11.664
Thanks. I've been feeling a little flat.

33:16.335 --> 33:19.338
Will the Peterson party
report to door number nine.

33:20.882 --> 33:23.801
Peterson party, please report
to door number nine.

33:25.344 --> 33:28.473
All new arrivals,
report to waiting room number eight.

33:35.105 --> 33:37.608
125 years. I can't believe this.

33:38.317 --> 33:40.569
I can't believe they didn't tell us.

33:43.447 --> 33:45.449
Oh, Adam, what is this?

33:49.786 --> 33:52.039
That's the Lost Souls' Room.

33:52.706 --> 33:55.501
A room for ghosts
that have been exorcised.

33:56.627 --> 33:58.086
Poor devils.

33:58.295 --> 34:00.422
That's death for the dead.

34:01.632 --> 34:03.717
It's all in the handbook.

34:03.926 --> 34:05.385
Keep moving.

34:10.181 --> 34:11.350
Five.

34:12.935 --> 34:14.937
This is the sixth door.

34:21.819 --> 34:24.947
Boy, this place just gets weirder
and weirder.

34:36.042 --> 34:37.460
We're home!

34:38.418 --> 34:41.505
Look at this place! Everything's different.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.467
All our furniture's gone.

34:46.135 --> 34:48.763
How long do you suppose
we were waiting there?

34:48.847 --> 34:50.348
Three months.

34:51.516 --> 34:54.518
I'd almost given up on you.
I was about to leave.

34:54.601 --> 34:56.646
I do have other clients.

34:57.188 --> 34:59.774
- Are you Juno, our caseworker?
- Yes.

34:59.858 --> 35:02.944
I evaluate individual cases and determine...

35:03.194 --> 35:06.322
...if help is needed, deserved and available.

35:06.531 --> 35:07.490
Are you available?

35:07.574 --> 35:08.616
No.

35:09.826 --> 35:12.371
- What's wrong?
- We're very unhappy.

35:13.080 --> 35:15.499
What did you expect? You're dead!

35:15.583 --> 35:19.837
We want to get rid of the people here.
We worked hard on this house.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.923
We probably wouldn't mind sharing
the house with people who were...

35:23.007 --> 35:25.384
- More like you used to be.
- Yes.

35:25.551 --> 35:27.178
But these people!

35:29.221 --> 35:31.223
Things seem quiet here.

35:32.349 --> 35:35.436
You should thank God
you didn't die in Italy.

35:35.895 --> 35:37.313
The Deetzes.

35:37.479 --> 35:40.608
- Have you been studying the manual?
- We tried.

35:41.567 --> 35:45.404
The intermediate interface chapter
on haunting says it all.

35:45.571 --> 35:48.532
Get them out yourselves! It's your house.

35:49.700 --> 35:52.453
Haunted houses aren't easy to come by.

35:52.536 --> 35:54.955
- We don't quite get it.
- I heard.

35:55.039 --> 35:56.874
Tore your faces off.

35:57.041 --> 36:01.170
It's useless to pull off your heads
in front of people who can't see you.

36:01.253 --> 36:03.672
- We should start simply?
- Start simply.

36:03.756 --> 36:06.676
Do what you know.
Use your talents. Practice.

36:08.470 --> 36:12.265
You should have been studying
those lessons since day one.

36:14.392 --> 36:15.977
I've got to go.

36:16.102 --> 36:18.605
What about that guy in the flyer, Betel...

36:19.898 --> 36:23.193
Don't even say his name.
You don't want his help.

36:24.319 --> 36:25.237
We might.

36:25.320 --> 36:28.615
No, you don't.
He does not work well with others.

36:30.158 --> 36:31.868
What do you mean?

36:36.039 --> 36:37.999
I didn't want to bring it up.

36:38.083 --> 36:42.045
But rather than have you make
another mistake, I'll tell you.

36:43.255 --> 36:45.090
He was my assistant.

36:45.507 --> 36:48.677
But he was a troublemaker.
He went out on his own...

36:48.760 --> 36:51.137
...as a freelance bio-exorcist.

36:52.138 --> 36:56.101
Claimed he could get rid of the living.
Got into more trouble.

37:00.064 --> 37:03.818
I believe he's been sleazing
around your cemetery lately.

37:05.778 --> 37:08.531
The only way he can be brought back...

37:08.698 --> 37:11.450
...is by calling his name three times.

37:12.451 --> 37:14.537
But I strongly suggest...

37:14.954 --> 37:17.790
...that you remove the Deetzes yourselves.

37:18.499 --> 37:19.876
How do we contact you...

37:19.959 --> 37:22.003
...if we need you again?

37:31.804 --> 37:34.515
Oh, Adam, that guy's in our cemetery.

37:35.224 --> 37:38.853
She's right. We just keep this simple.
We can do this.

38:02.920 --> 38:04.755
Hey, you, come here!

38:05.547 --> 38:06.798
Hungry?

38:07.549 --> 38:09.635
Come on. Hey, come here.

38:10.886 --> 38:13.847
I got something good for you.
Come on over.

38:13.931 --> 38:16.808
We'll have a little bite, something to nosh.

38:18.268 --> 38:20.103
- Come here!
- Help me!

38:24.900 --> 38:29.196
Maxie, haven't I always made you money?
That's the only real question.

38:29.279 --> 38:33.784
Nobody made me money like you.
You were a demon until your nerves went.

38:34.201 --> 38:35.911
It's just that...

38:36.537 --> 38:39.873
...Winter River, Connecticut is,
if you'll forgive me, nowhere.

38:39.957 --> 38:43.126
Why would I want to invest that kind
of money in an old building...

38:43.210 --> 38:46.881
...way the hell up there!
- It's not a building. That's the beauty.

38:46.965 --> 38:50.927
The people don't know the value of their
property. I can buy the whole town.

38:51.010 --> 38:53.888
Then we own a whole town
in the middle of nowhere.

38:54.347 --> 38:55.849
Come and see.

38:55.974 --> 38:57.642
And bring Sarah.

38:58.393 --> 39:02.063
All right, Charles.
It's just that I am kind of busy here.

39:02.146 --> 39:03.690
Just a minute.

39:04.858 --> 39:08.111
Listen. Enough of this talk
about visiting, okay? I gotta go.

39:08.194 --> 39:10.780
You take it easy up there, big fellow.

39:10.864 --> 39:13.032
- Good-bye.
- Max, wait, wait.

39:17.996 --> 39:18.913
Putz.

39:39.560 --> 39:43.647
Lydia, is Connecticut so boring?
I had Maxie Dean on the phone.

39:43.939 --> 39:47.776
Dad's found a way of making money
while I relax, so would you scram?

39:49.737 --> 39:53.782
Your mother will kill you when she sees
you cut holes in her $300 sheets.

39:56.702 --> 40:00.206
This is so corny. Is this what
we've been reduced to? Sheets?

40:00.289 --> 40:02.208
Think of them as death shrouds.

40:02.291 --> 40:04.835
And the moaning is important.
Really moan!

40:23.187 --> 40:25.689
God, how can he stand that woman?

40:32.279 --> 40:35.242
Cut it out! I'm a child, for God's sakes.

40:43.792 --> 40:47.212
- I feel so stupid.
- It's not stupid. We're ghosts!

40:47.796 --> 40:51.007
Do you want to spend the next 125 years
having breakfast with this woman?

40:51.091 --> 40:52.551
Moan louder.

41:00.934 --> 41:02.227
Oh, God!

41:10.277 --> 41:12.362
Sick. Sexual perversion.

41:12.612 --> 41:15.782
Do that weird sexual stuff
in your own bedroom.

41:21.997 --> 41:23.456
Ah, no feet.

41:35.720 --> 41:38.431
Are you the guys hiding in the attic?

41:38.514 --> 41:40.016
We're ghosts!

41:41.517 --> 41:44.312
- What do you look like under there?
- Aren't you scared?

41:44.395 --> 41:47.690
I'm not scared of sheets.
Are you gross under there?

41:47.773 --> 41:50.401
Are you Night of the Living Dead
under there?

41:50.484 --> 41:52.820
Like all bloody veins and pus?

41:52.904 --> 41:56.073
- "Night of the," what?
- "Living Dead." It's a movie.

41:56.157 --> 41:59.285
If I had seen a ghost at your age,
I would have been scared out of my wits.

41:59.368 --> 42:02.455
You're not gross.
Why are you wearing sheets?

42:03.206 --> 42:04.832
We're practicing.

42:04.916 --> 42:08.669
- You can see us without the sheets?
- Of course I can see you.

42:08.753 --> 42:11.172
How can you see us and nobody else can?

42:12.507 --> 42:16.093
I read through that
Handbook for the Recently Deceased.

42:16.177 --> 42:19.765
It says, "Live people ignore
the strange and unusual."

42:21.642 --> 42:24.061
I myself am strange and unusual.

42:25.938 --> 42:27.606
You look normal.

42:29.066 --> 42:31.109
- You read our book?
- Yes.

42:31.360 --> 42:34.404
- You could follow it?
- Yes. Why were you in Delia's bedroom?

42:34.488 --> 42:37.032
- Trying to scare your mother.
- Stepmother.

42:37.199 --> 42:40.827
You can't scare her.
She's sleeping with Prince Valium.

42:44.122 --> 42:45.541
You did this?

42:45.624 --> 42:48.210
You carved these houses and things?

42:49.670 --> 42:52.047
And this used to be your house.

42:52.506 --> 42:54.716
Why do you want to scare everybody?

42:54.800 --> 42:57.719
We wanted to frighten you
so you would move out.

42:59.596 --> 43:01.640
You don't know the Deetzes.

43:01.723 --> 43:05.686
My father bought this place.
He never walks away from equity.

43:05.811 --> 43:09.565
- Why don't you leave?
- We haven't left since the funeral.

43:10.858 --> 43:12.150
Funeral!

43:12.693 --> 43:15.071
God! You guys really are dead.

43:17.907 --> 43:19.576
This is amazing.

43:21.494 --> 43:23.037
- I better go.
- Wait.

43:23.121 --> 43:27.709
- Don't tell your parents we're here.
- Unless it will frighten them away.

43:27.834 --> 43:30.086
Tell them we are horrible...

43:30.295 --> 43:32.589
...desperate, ghoulish creatures
who will stop at nothing...

43:32.672 --> 43:34.757
...to get our house back.

43:37.051 --> 43:41.306
What if this is a dream? Can you do
any tricks to prove I'm not dreaming?

43:45.935 --> 43:50.273
If you are real ghosts, you better get
another routine because those sheets...

43:50.356 --> 43:52.150
...they don't work.

44:01.701 --> 44:02.952
Ghosts.

44:03.036 --> 44:05.580
You're telling me we have ghosts
in this house.

44:05.663 --> 44:07.958
Those pictures are of ghosts.

44:08.292 --> 44:09.543
Ghosts!

44:10.169 --> 44:13.923
Lydia, I am giving a dinner party
tonight for seven people.

44:14.006 --> 44:17.551
My agent, Bernard, is bringing a woman
who writes for Art in America.

44:17.635 --> 44:21.430
In fact, no one dining here
has not been in Vanity Fair except you.

44:22.056 --> 44:24.058
I told them you were too mean to be afraid.

44:24.141 --> 44:26.185
Don't you dare speak to others about me!

44:26.268 --> 44:30.356
Being embarrassed in front of the few
people who will set foot in here scares me.

44:30.439 --> 44:32.816
So let's play family just for tonight.

44:38.614 --> 44:40.783
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.

44:40.866 --> 44:42.576
She's got photos.

44:43.285 --> 44:45.829
Adam, you have a photo of Bigfoot.

44:46.497 --> 44:49.416
My photo of Bigfoot is a different story.

44:49.750 --> 44:54.296
We've got to get some help. We've got
to contact Betelmeyer or something.

45:08.019 --> 45:09.187
Look.

45:13.483 --> 45:15.360
It's him. Betelgeuse.

45:17.487 --> 45:18.655
Betelgeuse.

45:20.657 --> 45:22.659
Go ahead, Barbara, say it.

45:23.785 --> 45:25.203
Betelgeuse!

45:29.332 --> 45:30.876
What happened?

45:32.002 --> 45:34.171
I think we're in the model.

45:37.632 --> 45:39.134
Look at that.

46:02.325 --> 46:04.243
Where is he? What do we do?

46:08.456 --> 46:10.208
Looks like we dig.

46:40.738 --> 46:42.406
It's about time!

46:50.874 --> 46:54.127
- I say we open it.
- Maybe we should knock first.

47:12.062 --> 47:13.522
Adam. Babs.

47:21.530 --> 47:25.826
You can pick 'em! Is this
a solid relationship? Do I have a shot?

47:26.034 --> 47:29.037
- Excuse me.
- Sure. Am I overstepping my bounds?

47:29.121 --> 47:33.584
It's beautiful! You picked me.
You didn't have to, but you picked me.

47:33.834 --> 47:36.753
It makes me want to kiss you guys!
Come on, give me one.

47:36.837 --> 47:38.589
I beg your pardon!

47:38.922 --> 47:40.842
Let's get down to business.

47:40.925 --> 47:43.678
I've got a card here somewhere.
Here. Who do I have to kill?

47:43.761 --> 47:45.805
- Hold that for me.
- Whoa!

47:47.056 --> 47:49.434
- There you go.
- You don't have to kill anybody!

47:49.517 --> 47:54.272
Possession! Learn to throw your voice.
Fool your friends. Fun at parties.

47:54.355 --> 47:57.775
No. We just want to get some people
out of our house.

47:57.859 --> 48:02.030
I understand. In order to do that,
I'll have to get to know you.

48:02.322 --> 48:04.949
We've got to get closer.
Move in with you for a while.

48:05.033 --> 48:08.161
Get to be real pals.
You know what I'm saying?

48:08.328 --> 48:10.246
Save that guy for later.

48:10.330 --> 48:12.624
My wife and I have some questions.

48:12.707 --> 48:14.709
Sure, go ahead. Shoot.

48:15.001 --> 48:17.045
What are your qualifications?

48:17.128 --> 48:21.049
Well, I attended Juilliard. I'm a graduate
of Harvard Business School.

48:21.132 --> 48:24.677
I travel extensively.
I lived through the Black Plague.

48:24.761 --> 48:27.639
I've seen The Exorcist about 167 times...

48:27.722 --> 48:31.184
...and it keeps getting funnier
every time I see it!

48:31.559 --> 48:34.188
Not to mention the fact
that you're talking to a dead guy!

48:34.271 --> 48:37.441
Now what do you think?
You think I'm qualified?

48:38.526 --> 48:40.236
Can you be scary?

48:40.528 --> 48:43.864
Oh! I know what you're asking me.
Can I be scary?

48:45.824 --> 48:47.952
What do you think of this?

48:48.369 --> 48:49.828
You like it?

48:50.913 --> 48:54.416
- Will you excuse us, please?
- Sure. Talk amongst yourselves.

48:54.500 --> 48:57.670
- Let's go.
- I know, but he can be useful later.

48:57.878 --> 49:00.881
- We can work something ourselves.
- Oh, yeah!

49:01.924 --> 49:03.634
- Excuse me!
- What?

49:03.759 --> 49:05.553
We are leaving now.

49:05.761 --> 49:07.263
Don't go yet.

49:07.930 --> 49:12.101
Come on, we're simpatico.
Look at us. We shop at the same store.

49:12.935 --> 49:14.436
Hey, hermano.

49:14.937 --> 49:16.730
Yeah, there you go.

49:18.524 --> 49:20.609
We're like peas in a pod.

49:20.943 --> 49:25.197
You want someone out of the house.
I want to get someone out of your house.

49:25.281 --> 49:28.618
Look! You've been to Saturn.
I've been to Saturn!

49:28.952 --> 49:30.662
Whoa. Sandworms.

49:31.496 --> 49:34.374
You hate 'em, right? I hate 'em myself.

49:34.791 --> 49:38.461
Kids, what do I have to do
to strike a deal with you two?

49:45.969 --> 49:48.889
- Don't you hate it when that happens?
- Let's go, Barbara!

49:48.972 --> 49:52.267
Come up for a while.
We'll talk inside. Come on.

49:52.434 --> 49:54.686
- I'm not staying.
- The place is a mess.

49:54.769 --> 49:56.938
We have to get out of here.

49:57.439 --> 49:58.940
Home! Home! Home!

50:00.734 --> 50:02.152
How did you do that?

50:02.235 --> 50:04.154
Hope you like Italian.

50:04.529 --> 50:07.240
Where'd you go? Hey, where'd you go?

50:07.407 --> 50:09.910
Hey! You've got to work with me here.

50:09.993 --> 50:12.537
I'm just trying to cut a deal.
What do you want me to do?

50:12.621 --> 50:14.164
Where are you?

50:14.456 --> 50:16.291
You bunch of losers!

50:17.042 --> 50:19.920
You're working with a professional here!

50:24.175 --> 50:25.968
Nice fucking model!

50:26.469 --> 50:28.888
We can do this stuff on our own.

50:29.138 --> 50:32.350
Besides, I'm not exposing
that little girl to that pervert.

50:32.433 --> 50:35.436
We did call him,
and he seemed awfully pissed off.

50:35.520 --> 50:40.399
I don't care. I've changed my mind.
We can scare them off ourselves... tonight.

50:40.900 --> 50:42.485
I have an idea.

50:49.075 --> 50:51.994
What you did with the place is wonderful.

50:52.078 --> 50:53.621
Not me. Them.

50:55.164 --> 50:56.249
So?

51:01.254 --> 51:02.797
You like them.

51:03.339 --> 51:07.301
I hope it wasn't yet another
of your dreary suicide attempts.

51:07.635 --> 51:10.429
You know what they say about people
who commit suicide?

51:10.513 --> 51:13.475
In the afterlife, they become civil servants.

51:15.769 --> 51:18.730
Otho, I didn't realize
you were into the supernatural.

51:18.814 --> 51:20.899
Of course! You remember.

51:21.024 --> 51:23.694
After my stint with the Living Theater...

51:23.777 --> 51:27.364
...I was one of New York's
leading paranormal researchers...

51:27.447 --> 51:29.366
...until the bottom dropped out in '72.

51:29.449 --> 51:33.036
Paranormal? Is that what
they're calling your kind these days?

51:33.453 --> 51:37.958
Don't mind her. She's still upset that
somebody dropped a house on her sister.

51:41.169 --> 51:43.463
Well, this looks really good.

51:45.132 --> 51:46.884
I saw some ghosts.

51:53.140 --> 51:56.727
- It's a private joke Lydia and I share.
- It's not a joke.

51:56.810 --> 52:01.148
Yes, it is. Just today she tried
to convince me this house is haunted.

52:03.150 --> 52:05.444
Kids! You know, I love them!

52:07.322 --> 52:10.033
- Ghosts?
- In designer sheets, no less.

52:11.075 --> 52:14.454
I'd like to propose a toast
to our intrepid friends...

52:14.537 --> 52:17.624
...who braved the expressway
and two dozen tollbooths to be with us.

52:17.707 --> 52:19.751
May your buildings go condo.

52:21.419 --> 52:23.963
Lydia, favor us about your ghosts.

52:24.380 --> 52:26.758
No! I am sick of that subject.

52:27.008 --> 52:28.760
Delia, lighten up.

52:29.344 --> 52:31.513
I would rather talk about...

52:46.903 --> 52:48.446
That's cute, Delia.

53:00.751 --> 53:02.836
Otho, are you doing this?

54:30.509 --> 54:31.885
We did it!

54:33.512 --> 54:35.305
Let's watch them scatter.

54:35.388 --> 54:39.059
Any minute now they'll come
running out of that door screaming.

54:42.312 --> 54:43.813
Any minute now.

54:51.030 --> 54:52.615
It's me, Lydia.

54:55.993 --> 54:57.912
They want you to come downstairs.

54:57.995 --> 55:00.998
Delia says you can wear
any sheets you want.

55:01.999 --> 55:04.794
It was like being in an amusement park.

55:05.169 --> 55:06.087
Wham!

55:06.295 --> 55:10.007
- I didn't know I could do the calypso.
- Who has more fun than us?

55:10.091 --> 55:12.802
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn.

55:13.135 --> 55:16.722
A very sophisticated pair.
They even appear in sheets.

55:18.182 --> 55:21.394
Charles, why didn't you tell us
about this before?

55:22.895 --> 55:27.608
We're not sure we want our secret out.
Everyone will want them for parties.

55:27.692 --> 55:29.443
People will pay big money for this.

55:29.527 --> 55:33.531
The Enquirer is offering $50,000
for proof of life after death.

55:35.366 --> 55:38.369
This is it, Charles.
You can get Maxie Dean up here now.

55:38.452 --> 55:41.540
- You think so?
- Sarah loves the supernatural.

55:42.457 --> 55:44.668
She'll have him sprint up here
in his helicopter...

55:44.751 --> 55:47.421
...if you can produce ghosts for her.

55:50.924 --> 55:53.886
I should remind you that I'm Delia's agent.

55:53.969 --> 55:56.305
I have lost money on her work for years.

55:56.388 --> 55:58.974
If anything happened here, I shall handle it.

55:59.057 --> 56:01.393
But not until I've seen real proof.

56:01.476 --> 56:05.439
- What about this table?
- What do you call what just happened?

56:05.731 --> 56:08.233
What money?
Don't you believe in my work?

56:09.151 --> 56:10.652
Here's Lydia.

56:11.278 --> 56:13.906
- Well?
- They don't want to come down.

56:21.705 --> 56:22.998
Why not?

56:24.750 --> 56:28.879
I think they were trying to scare you away,
and you didn't get scared.

56:28.962 --> 56:32.216
They're dead.
It's a little late to be neurotic.

56:36.221 --> 56:37.597
All right.

56:43.353 --> 56:46.356
This was not a hallucination.
This was real.

56:47.690 --> 56:52.403
We all experienced a super-powerful
paranormal experience and it was real.

56:53.112 --> 56:56.616
Delia, you are a flake.
You have always been a flake.

56:57.450 --> 57:01.538
If you insist on frightening people,
do it with your sculpture.

57:02.705 --> 57:04.374
Drive carefully!

57:04.457 --> 57:06.376
- I'm dead.
- Where do they hide?

57:06.459 --> 57:08.836
- The attic.
- The attic's locked.

57:09.671 --> 57:12.257
They're ghosts.
They can do what they want.

57:12.340 --> 57:15.510
They do whatever they want.
Take us up there right now.

57:21.933 --> 57:25.103
Fabulous! Otho Fenlock's
"Locked Door Ghosts!"

57:25.353 --> 57:26.938
Probably committed suicide up there.

57:27.021 --> 57:29.108
- I'm enchanted.
- In there?

57:29.358 --> 57:32.278
- They must live like animals.
- It's locked. How did they get in?

57:32.361 --> 57:35.447
Open this door, Dead People,
or we'll bust it down...

57:35.531 --> 57:38.033
...and drag you out by the ropes
you hanged yourself with!

57:38.117 --> 57:40.536
- They didn't commit suicide.
- It doesn't matter.

57:40.619 --> 57:44.248
I can teach you something here.
Take the upper hand in all situations...

57:44.331 --> 57:47.209
...or people, dead or alive,
will walk all over you.

57:47.293 --> 57:48.586
Open up!

58:00.931 --> 58:02.516
Where are they?

58:02.683 --> 58:04.977
These ghosts are nice people.

58:05.352 --> 58:09.023
I think we scared them away,
so let's leave them alone, all right?

58:09.106 --> 58:11.192
It's the whole damn town.

58:12.443 --> 58:14.945
I have never been so embarrassed.

58:15.863 --> 58:17.781
Have they gone for good?

58:24.080 --> 58:25.498
Dad, don't.

58:25.832 --> 58:27.626
Mom, let's just go.

58:40.347 --> 58:41.932
No ghosts here.

58:44.726 --> 58:48.313
Come on! If they are in here,
I don't want to scare them away.

58:50.190 --> 58:53.443
We're leaving now.
You can go about your business.

58:55.612 --> 58:58.448
- What are we doing?
- Quick, quick, quick.

59:05.705 --> 59:08.833
Oh, boy! You guys are really spooksters,
aren't you?

59:09.834 --> 59:13.463
Now, let's turn on the juice
and see what shakes loose.

59:16.092 --> 59:19.887
Otho, get Maxie on the phone.
We've really got something here.

59:19.971 --> 59:24.016
We can turn this place into the world's
leading supernatural research center.

59:24.100 --> 59:27.228
An amusement park. I'll do a presentation.
Lydia will bring the ghosts.

59:27.311 --> 59:30.314
I can't bring the ghosts. They're not here.

59:30.398 --> 59:34.110
- Otho, can't you do something?
- If I'm properly motivated.

59:36.779 --> 59:39.532
What type of motivation do you require?

59:39.615 --> 59:43.494
Why don't you leave them alone?
They didn't do anything to you.

01:00:30.959 --> 01:00:33.587
We've come for your daughter, Chuck.

01:00:34.588 --> 01:00:35.964
Stop! Stop!

01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:50.521
- Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse!
- Oh, no!

01:00:52.564 --> 01:00:54.566
Why are you doing this?

01:00:56.235 --> 01:00:58.403
Leave me alone, all of you!

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:06.913
Great choice! We spend the next century
hanging out a window or doing tricks.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:10.208
Maybe they'll leave now.
That snake was a nasty customer.

01:01:10.291 --> 01:01:12.418
- He could've hurt somebody.
- But he didn't.

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.963
We've got them where we want them.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:23.012
You losers! How dare you interrupt
a professional while he's working!

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:25.807
I'm not fond of Charles,
but you could've killed him.

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:29.060
I'm just doing my job!
I thought we had a deal.

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:31.271
It's okay. You know why?

01:01:31.729 --> 01:01:35.900
I don't want to do business
with you deadbeats anyway, thank you.

01:01:36.317 --> 01:01:40.154
The only one I think I can deal with
is Edgar Allan Poe's daughter.

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:42.615
- She understands me.
- Leave her alone!

01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:57.381
Go ahead, make my millennium.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:08.517
I'm feeling a little anxious,
if you know what I mean.

01:02:08.976 --> 01:02:11.103
It's been about 600 years.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.607
I wonder where an everyday Joe
like myself...

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:17.443
...can find a little action.

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.545
Yeah. Here I come, baby.

01:02:40.925 --> 01:02:42.676
Hey, Adam, nice move!

01:02:44.345 --> 01:02:46.889
- Why did you build that?
- I didn't.

01:02:57.025 --> 01:02:59.361
Will you guys shut up and leave me alone?

01:02:59.444 --> 01:03:01.780
I've got all this paperwork to do.

01:03:04.074 --> 01:03:06.117
You two, come in. Sit down.

01:03:06.201 --> 01:03:08.286
Get in here, both of you!

01:03:11.915 --> 01:03:16.086
The whorehouse was my idea.
I want Betelgeuse out of the picture.

01:03:17.212 --> 01:03:19.381
You two have really screwed up.

01:03:19.881 --> 01:03:22.884
I heard you allowed yourselves
to be photographed.

01:03:22.968 --> 01:03:25.720
You let Betelgeuse out
and didn't put him back.

01:03:25.804 --> 01:03:28.181
And you let Otho take the handbook!

01:03:28.265 --> 01:03:29.432
When?

01:03:30.725 --> 01:03:32.727
Never trust the living!

01:03:33.311 --> 01:03:35.981
We cannot have
a routine haunting like yours...

01:03:36.064 --> 01:03:39.651
...provide proof that there is existence
beyond death.

01:03:40.485 --> 01:03:42.822
Coach, where's the men's room?

01:03:44.031 --> 01:03:46.534
I'm not your coach. He survived.

01:03:46.701 --> 01:03:48.786
Let me get something straight.

01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:51.497
- What's our curfew?
- Get out of here!

01:03:52.498 --> 01:03:55.084
Go on, get downstairs! Men's room!

01:03:55.668 --> 01:03:58.254
Are you kidding? Can't you read signs?

01:03:58.337 --> 01:04:00.131
I'll be right back.

01:04:12.393 --> 01:04:14.520
Maybe this was a bad idea.

01:04:14.896 --> 01:04:16.814
I didn't say anything.

01:04:18.774 --> 01:04:21.694
Who are we kidding?
You've never had a bad idea.

01:04:21.777 --> 01:04:22.945
Yeah?

01:04:25.698 --> 01:04:27.742
This could all work out.

01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:30.453
Home.

01:04:33.956 --> 01:04:36.585
I'm not sure this is the right environment
for Lydia.

01:04:36.668 --> 01:04:38.754
- Snakes. Ghosts.
- Shrimp.

01:04:40.339 --> 01:04:42.049
You family types.

01:04:42.341 --> 01:04:46.136
You've got other things to worry about.
Maxie Dean is coming tonight.

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:49.723
You have to sell these ghosts.
I can only do so much.

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:53.393
What are you going to do?
Viciously rearrange their environment?

01:04:53.477 --> 01:04:57.648
I know as much about the supernatural
as I do about interior design.

01:05:05.531 --> 01:05:06.823
"I am...

01:05:07.241 --> 01:05:08.367
"...alone.

01:05:18.919 --> 01:05:20.170
"I am...

01:05:21.088 --> 01:05:22.631
"...utterly...

01:05:22.881 --> 01:05:24.007
"...alone.

01:05:25.551 --> 01:05:27.135
"By the time...

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:30.473
"...you read this...

01:05:31.182 --> 01:05:32.684
"...I will...

01:05:33.101 --> 01:05:34.352
"...be gone...

01:05:35.937 --> 01:05:37.689
"...having jumped...

01:05:39.983 --> 01:05:41.818
"Having plummeted...

01:05:43.736 --> 01:05:44.863
"...off...

01:05:45.655 --> 01:05:47.824
"...the Winter River Bridge."

01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:53.079
I don't care what it takes.

01:05:53.162 --> 01:05:55.790
You get the Deetzes out of there now!

01:05:57.125 --> 01:05:58.668
Wait a minute.

01:06:00.753 --> 01:06:02.505
What are you going to do?

01:06:03.089 --> 01:06:04.632
To scare them.

01:06:05.091 --> 01:06:08.177
I want to make sure
it's not some silly parlor trick.

01:06:08.803 --> 01:06:10.346
I'll go first.

01:06:32.578 --> 01:06:34.330
Not bad. Not bad.

01:06:35.748 --> 01:06:36.790
Now you.

01:06:37.333 --> 01:06:38.667
Go ahead!

01:06:53.599 --> 01:06:55.184
You look great.

01:06:55.851 --> 01:07:00.022
Go clean house and don't forget
the photographs and the handbook.

01:07:08.864 --> 01:07:10.366
- Coach?
- What?

01:07:11.909 --> 01:07:14.245
I don't think we survived that crash.

01:07:14.328 --> 01:07:15.997
How did you guess?

01:07:19.626 --> 01:07:21.545
Mr. And Mrs. Maitland?

01:07:26.299 --> 01:07:27.509
Hello?

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:30.470
- Where are you?
- Dead.

01:07:32.013 --> 01:07:33.848
Dead, dead, deadski.

01:07:35.517 --> 01:07:37.394
Of course they're dead. They're ghosts.

01:07:37.477 --> 01:07:41.481
No, I mean they're gone. Split.
Out of here. Afterlife kids.

01:07:42.023 --> 01:07:44.442
- Deceased.
- Are you a ghost, too?

01:07:46.486 --> 01:07:49.030
I'm the ghost with the most, babe.

01:07:51.366 --> 01:07:54.160
You look like somebody I can relate to.

01:07:55.912 --> 01:07:58.790
Maybe you could help me get out of here.

01:07:59.249 --> 01:08:01.877
I gotta tell you, this death thing...

01:08:05.046 --> 01:08:06.464
It's creepy.

01:08:06.548 --> 01:08:08.301
Here's my problem.

01:08:08.718 --> 01:08:11.971
I've got friends on the outside
I said I'd meet.

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:14.640
I have to be there in person.

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:17.059
So could you help me get out of here?

01:08:18.185 --> 01:08:19.895
I want to get in.

01:08:20.897 --> 01:08:21.939
Why?

01:08:23.691 --> 01:08:27.486
You've probably got your reasons,
but I can't do anything from here.

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:31.323
If you could get me out, over there,
maybe we could talk.

01:08:32.491 --> 01:08:35.995
But to do that you've got
to say my name three times.

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:37.787
What's your name?

01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:40.041
I can't tell you.

01:08:40.582 --> 01:08:41.626
Why not?

01:08:42.167 --> 01:08:46.214
If I tell you, you'll tell your friends,
they'll call me all the time.

01:08:46.296 --> 01:08:50.384
I've got to go to shopping centers for
openings, sign autographs, that shit.

01:08:50.468 --> 01:08:53.554
It makes my life hell, okay? A living hell.

01:08:54.055 --> 01:08:57.975
But maybe if you have a pen...
I know! Do you play charades?

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.060
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:02.397
Here we go. Ready?

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:03.982
Two words.

01:09:04.649 --> 01:09:05.859
Right!

01:09:07.402 --> 01:09:09.529
First word, two syllables.

01:09:10.238 --> 01:09:11.406
Look.

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:13.908
Turn around.

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:17.537
I don't know what your signal means.

01:09:17.621 --> 01:09:19.288
Look behind you!

01:09:19.997 --> 01:09:21.707
Hi. How are you?

01:09:22.167 --> 01:09:23.417
Beetle.

01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:25.420
Got it. Now, two.

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:31.218
Breakfast? Orange? Orange beetle?

01:09:31.343 --> 01:09:32.844
Beetle fruit?

01:09:33.345 --> 01:09:35.055
Beetle breakfast?

01:09:36.098 --> 01:09:37.515
Beetle drink?

01:09:40.352 --> 01:09:41.854
Beetle juice?

01:09:41.979 --> 01:09:44.564
- That's it!
- Your name's Beetlejuice?

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:48.068
You said it twice.
Just say it once more. Come on.

01:09:48.318 --> 01:09:50.863
It was you, wasn't it? The snake.

01:09:52.029 --> 01:09:54.993
You kids and your imagination!
Just say it!

01:09:56.119 --> 01:09:57.203
No.

01:09:58.997 --> 01:10:00.123
I want to talk to Barbara.

01:10:00.206 --> 01:10:03.376
You don't need to talk to Barbara!
Just say it!

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:10.925
Adam, I can't go through with it.
I like that little girl.

01:10:11.009 --> 01:10:14.429
But it's too late.
We have to go through with this.

01:10:14.721 --> 01:10:17.056
No, we don't. Can't we rebel?

01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:26.274
I want to be with Lydia.

01:10:37.410 --> 01:10:39.329
Come on! Just say it!

01:10:41.539 --> 01:10:43.166
No, don't say it!

01:10:44.375 --> 01:10:45.627
Say it!

01:10:46.252 --> 01:10:49.006
It's okay. It's us. What's going on?

01:10:50.424 --> 01:10:51.717
Beetle...

01:10:52.218 --> 01:10:55.763
He said if I let him out he would
take me to the other side to find you.

01:10:55.846 --> 01:10:57.765
No, Lydia, we're dead.

01:11:00.309 --> 01:11:02.311
- I want to be dead, too.
- No!

01:11:10.945 --> 01:11:13.864
Being dead doesn't make things any easier.

01:11:13.948 --> 01:11:17.910
Listen to her on this.
This is something we know a lot about.

01:11:18.953 --> 01:11:21.705
And you can visit us anytime you want.

01:11:23.332 --> 01:11:27.127
I have a feeling things are going
to be better from now on.

01:11:28.087 --> 01:11:30.172
What do you mean, better?

01:11:30.381 --> 01:11:34.510
We've decided we're going to invite
you and your family to stay.

01:11:35.636 --> 01:11:37.096
That's right.

01:11:42.561 --> 01:11:45.897
- Can't we bring Maxie up here?
- You've got a stake in this, too.

01:11:45.981 --> 01:11:50.694
This is a presentation. It requires
a sense of occasion, a sense of style.

01:11:50.777 --> 01:11:53.405
- It's big. How will we get it out?
- It's sectional.

01:11:53.488 --> 01:11:55.323
- Wait, there are plugs.
- Careful!

01:11:55.407 --> 01:11:56.741
Okay, go.

01:11:58.577 --> 01:12:01.705
- What's going on?
- I don't know. I'll find out.

01:12:01.788 --> 01:12:03.206
Be careful.

01:12:04.583 --> 01:12:07.043
We've got Ed Cornwell
to head the wax museum...

01:12:07.127 --> 01:12:11.214
...dedicated to 50 great moments
of the paranormal in Thanksgiving Park.

01:12:11.298 --> 01:12:13.174
You must remember Ed.

01:12:14.134 --> 01:12:17.888
He's the genius who gave us
the talking Marcel Marceau statue.

01:12:19.598 --> 01:12:23.184
And D-Con is on its knees
to sponsor the insect zoo...

01:12:24.394 --> 01:12:26.688
...in the old hardware store.

01:12:27.063 --> 01:12:28.481
We can't lose!

01:12:34.738 --> 01:12:39.160
Lydia, you decided to join us.
I just finished the initial presentation.

01:12:39.243 --> 01:12:41.787
Now it's time to have a stretch...

01:12:42.288 --> 01:12:45.625
...and to invite our friends
to meet your friends.

01:12:46.292 --> 01:12:48.044
Are they here yet?

01:12:48.377 --> 01:12:51.172
Charles, we're here to see some ghosts.

01:12:53.257 --> 01:12:55.426
They're not here... anymore.

01:12:59.847 --> 01:13:02.308
Every time she says that, the paint peels...

01:13:02.391 --> 01:13:05.394
...and some wild creature tries to kill us.

01:13:06.938 --> 01:13:09.190
But we have pictures, Lydia.

01:13:09.357 --> 01:13:12.360
Really. They said they'd come back
and we could all live here...

01:13:12.443 --> 01:13:16.614
...if you agreed not to tease them
or make them do stupid tricks.

01:13:17.615 --> 01:13:20.034
She has a tendency to overreact.

01:13:20.535 --> 01:13:23.996
Don't worry, we're not relying on her.
We have Otho.

01:13:27.291 --> 01:13:30.587
- Are they still here?
- Otho, are they still here?

01:13:30.796 --> 01:13:33.924
They're still here. They're just hiding out.

01:13:34.633 --> 01:13:37.219
They probably feel guilty
about what they did to me.

01:13:37.302 --> 01:13:39.221
They're sorry they didn't kill you.

01:13:39.304 --> 01:13:41.348
I just want to see them.

01:13:43.809 --> 01:13:45.352
Otho, can you do it?

01:13:45.477 --> 01:13:48.605
- It'll be tricky, but I think I can handle it.
- No!

01:13:53.527 --> 01:13:56.989
What am I worried about?
You can't even change a tire.

01:13:59.908 --> 01:14:02.661
I'll be needing
something personal of theirs.

01:14:02.744 --> 01:14:04.913
You'll have to go to the Goodwill.

01:14:07.833 --> 01:14:09.209
Excuse me.

01:14:21.681 --> 01:14:23.516
The wedding clothes.

01:14:25.184 --> 01:14:26.561
The words:

01:14:34.861 --> 01:14:36.529
"Hands vermilion

01:14:36.988 --> 01:14:38.531
"Start of five

01:14:39.407 --> 01:14:40.867
"Bright cotillion

01:14:41.951 --> 01:14:43.453
"Raven's dive

01:14:44.412 --> 01:14:46.039
"Nightshade's promise

01:14:46.789 --> 01:14:48.374
"Spirits strive

01:14:49.542 --> 01:14:52.545
"To the living,
let now the dead come alive"

01:15:07.685 --> 01:15:08.978
Barbara?

01:15:11.231 --> 01:15:13.483
"As sudden thunder pierces night

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:17.071
"As magic wonder mad affright

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:19.865
"Rives asunder man's delight

01:15:21.367 --> 01:15:23.285
"Our ghost, our corpse

01:15:24.411 --> 01:15:26.205
"And we rise to be"

01:15:36.382 --> 01:15:37.424
Help!

01:15:45.849 --> 01:15:47.142
Stop it!

01:15:49.895 --> 01:15:51.730
"As flies the lizard

01:15:51.855 --> 01:15:53.107
"Serpent fell

01:15:53.566 --> 01:15:55.568
"As goblin vizard at the spell

01:15:57.027 --> 01:15:59.822
"The buried, dead and slain rise again"

01:16:47.037 --> 01:16:49.122
What's happening to them?

01:16:50.415 --> 01:16:51.666
I don't know.

01:16:53.251 --> 01:16:54.794
They're dying!

01:16:54.878 --> 01:16:57.589
They're already dead.
They can't feel a thing.

01:16:58.465 --> 01:17:01.551
- That's not true! Look at them!
- That's enough.

01:17:01.635 --> 01:17:03.346
Can we stop this?

01:17:05.389 --> 01:17:07.975
It's too late, Charles. I'm sorry.

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:18.444
Where are you? Help them, please.

01:17:22.573 --> 01:17:25.868
Sure, I can help them.
But you've got to help me.

01:17:25.952 --> 01:17:28.913
- What?
- I'm what you call an illegal alien.

01:17:29.038 --> 01:17:32.708
I want out for good.
To do that, I've gotta get married.

01:17:34.627 --> 01:17:38.714
These aren't my rules. Come to think of it,
I don't have any rules.

01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:40.883
Come on.

01:17:41.592 --> 01:17:44.637
Think of it as a marriage of inconvenience.
We both get something.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:48.724
I get out. You get the most
eligible bachelor since Valentino.

01:17:49.016 --> 01:17:51.561
- We're even.
- Okay, just help them.

01:17:54.855 --> 01:17:56.024
Sure.

01:18:06.535 --> 01:18:07.995
Beetlejuice.

01:18:16.378 --> 01:18:17.963
It's show time.

01:18:35.606 --> 01:18:37.524
Attention, K-Mart shoppers:

01:18:48.661 --> 01:18:53.124
I'm back. I feel real good about myself.
You know what I mean? So...

01:18:53.458 --> 01:18:55.293
...without further delay...

01:18:56.711 --> 01:18:58.671
...welcome to Winter River!

01:18:58.755 --> 01:19:00.798
Museum of Natural Greed!

01:19:01.049 --> 01:19:03.218
A monument to the bored businessman.

01:19:03.301 --> 01:19:07.055
Come a little closer.
Step right up! Test your strength.

01:19:29.244 --> 01:19:30.620
Thank you.

01:19:30.745 --> 01:19:32.455
Thank you! Whew!

01:19:33.831 --> 01:19:37.460
That is why I won't do
two shows a night anymore, babe.

01:19:37.919 --> 01:19:39.504
I won't do 'em.

01:19:39.629 --> 01:19:42.591
Well, what have we got here tonight, kids?

01:19:45.553 --> 01:19:47.596
We've got the Maitlands.

01:19:47.846 --> 01:19:50.766
I think they've had enough exercise
for tonight.

01:19:57.773 --> 01:20:00.859
Not so fast, Round Boy.
We're gonna have some laughs.

01:20:21.338 --> 01:20:22.673
Mom, Dad:

01:20:25.801 --> 01:20:28.679
I just want you two to know
you're welcome in our house...

01:20:28.762 --> 01:20:31.056
...anytime you want to come over.

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:34.018
In the meantime, the dowry's on me, Dad.

01:20:38.315 --> 01:20:42.819
The Maitlands are taken care of.
Everything seems to be back to normal.

01:20:47.908 --> 01:20:49.242
Shall we?

01:20:59.628 --> 01:21:02.005
Called the caterer. He's got a great band.

01:21:02.088 --> 01:21:04.883
We're gonna need witnesses. Would you?

01:21:55.309 --> 01:21:57.520
Let's get on with the ceremony.

01:21:57.603 --> 01:21:59.188
Do you, Betel...

01:22:00.773 --> 01:22:04.277
- Nobody says the "B" word.
- Do you take this woman...

01:22:04.944 --> 01:22:07.071
...to be your wedded wife?

01:22:07.947 --> 01:22:10.533
I don't know. It's a big decision.

01:22:10.616 --> 01:22:14.495
I always said if I ever did it,
I was gonna do it only once.

01:22:15.454 --> 01:22:16.873
Sure. Go ahead.

01:22:16.956 --> 01:22:19.500
And do you, Lydia, take this man...

01:22:20.167 --> 01:22:21.627
No! Betel...

01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:26.967
She's a little nervous.
Maybe I should answer for her.

01:22:27.134 --> 01:22:29.052
I'm Lydia Deetz and I'm of sound mind.

01:22:29.136 --> 01:22:31.680
The man next to me is the one I want.
You asked me.

01:22:31.763 --> 01:22:34.766
I'm answering.
Yes, I love that man of mine.

01:22:35.434 --> 01:22:36.476
Come on.

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:41.773
Come on.

01:22:42.983 --> 01:22:44.359
Betelgeu...

01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:51.200
Scram!

01:22:53.035 --> 01:22:54.328
Come on!

01:22:55.996 --> 01:22:57.331
Hey, guy.

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:02.920
May we continue with the ceremony?

01:23:05.631 --> 01:23:07.549
- Then by...
- Betelgeuse.

01:23:17.518 --> 01:23:18.770
Strike!

01:23:22.023 --> 01:23:23.441
Let's roll!

01:23:23.691 --> 01:23:26.319
Then by the authority vested in me...

01:23:26.986 --> 01:23:29.614
- The ring, please.
- The ring! Oh, no!

01:23:37.664 --> 01:23:39.457
I've got it, honey.

01:23:55.515 --> 01:23:57.600
Here it is. Here you go.

01:23:58.226 --> 01:24:01.145
She meant nothing to me. Nothing at all!

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:09.905
- I now pronounce you...
- Yeah, come on.

01:24:11.782 --> 01:24:13.117
Man and...

01:25:12.552 --> 01:25:15.096
- What time is it?
- It's about 3:30.

01:25:16.431 --> 01:25:18.266
Give or take a year.

01:25:24.856 --> 01:25:26.024
Well?

01:25:27.275 --> 01:25:28.360
Did you get the paints?

01:25:28.443 --> 01:25:31.947
Yes. And I took pictures
of the new town hall for you, too.

01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:33.949
How was the science test?

01:25:34.032 --> 01:25:37.118
It was gross.
They wanted me to dissect a frog.

01:25:37.202 --> 01:25:40.622
I told them "no way." I said it was
against my religion. I got a "C."

01:25:40.705 --> 01:25:42.457
And the math test?

01:25:44.125 --> 01:25:48.421
You're kidding me? We spent
the whole week studying for that test.

01:25:48.755 --> 01:25:50.257
I got an "A."

01:25:50.507 --> 01:25:51.883
So, can I?

01:25:52.551 --> 01:25:55.554
I don't know.
Got a "C" on the science test.

01:25:57.348 --> 01:26:00.268
Don't tease her.
You never got on "A" in science...

01:26:04.981 --> 01:26:06.274
Come on.

01:26:07.942 --> 01:26:09.193
Well...

01:26:10.236 --> 01:26:11.696
...I suppose.

01:26:28.296 --> 01:26:30.381
This reads like stereo instructions.

01:26:30.464 --> 01:26:33.175
Sounds like Lydia got an "A"
on the math test.

01:26:35.469 --> 01:26:36.929
He likes it.

01:27:17.638 --> 01:27:19.973
Sorry. Didn't see you sitting there.

01:27:21.892 --> 01:27:23.101
Women.

01:27:24.144 --> 01:27:26.647
I don't know what her problem is.

01:27:27.439 --> 01:27:28.857
Normally, chicks...

01:27:43.498 --> 01:27:45.458
Pardon me. Did you do that?

01:27:45.542 --> 01:27:46.918
Nice work.

01:27:47.126 --> 01:27:49.212
How do you get them so small?

01:27:49.295 --> 01:27:51.256
There goes Elvis! Yo, King!

01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:56.177
Well, looks like I'm next.

01:27:58.221 --> 01:28:02.850
Good thing. I've got to do a photo shoot
for G.Q. In an hour and a half.

01:28:03.851 --> 01:28:07.730
They've been after me for months.
Some kind of underwear deal.

01:28:09.399 --> 01:28:12.318
What are you doing? Stop it.
You're messing up my hair.

01:28:12.402 --> 01:28:14.487
Come on! Whoa! Stop it!

01:28:18.074 --> 01:28:20.451
This might be a good look for me.
