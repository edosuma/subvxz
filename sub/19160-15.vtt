40:27.880 --> 40:29.330
Nature abhors a vacuum.

40:29.330 --> 40:30.710
Had B613 continued,

40:30.710 --> 40:32.620
none of this
would have happened.

40:32.620 --> 40:34.880
You need to reinstate it
by executive order --

40:34.880 --> 40:36.790
your last act
as president.

40:36.790 --> 40:38.960
You think I'd hand
that kind of power

40:38.960 --> 40:40.710
back to the man
who almost ruined this country?

40:40.710 --> 40:42.380
Who said I'd run it?!

40:42.380 --> 40:44.920
My time is gone.
It's your time now.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.920
You are going to
run it.

40:46.920 --> 40:49.540
I made a call --
the right call --

40:49.540 --> 40:50.830
the only call --

40:50.830 --> 40:52.750
and I'm going to be making
a lot more of them now,

40:52.750 --> 40:55.040
so believe me
when I tell you,

40:55.040 --> 40:56.880
my mother
will not fail me.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.120
You understand
the balance of power,

40:59.120 --> 41:00.960
the fragility
of the Republic,

41:00.960 --> 41:02.580
the inner workings
of our military

41:02.580 --> 41:04.170
and our
intelligence communities.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.920
Much as I would like
to disagree with myself,

41:06.920 --> 41:08.040
I have to admit,

41:08.040 --> 41:10.710
there is no one
more suited for the job

41:10.710 --> 41:13.670
to keep a check
on power.
