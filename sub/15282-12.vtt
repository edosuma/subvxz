{\a6}CHULA VISTA,CA

00:14.960 --> 00:16.140
Have you I.D.'D the body?

00:16.149 --> 00:16.920
It's a girl.

00:16.930 --> 00:17.810
One of the missing girls?

00:17.820 --> 00:20.410
All I can tell you
right now is it's a girl.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.970
Did you draw up a list of
those involved in the search?

00:22.980 --> 00:25.150
You're gonna find the parents
of the girls on that list.

00:25.160 --> 00:27.400
Please tell me they
didn't discover the body.

00:27.410 --> 00:29.620
No.As soon as our dogs caught her scent,

00:29.630 --> 00:31.760
we kept them away from the scene.

00:32.259 --> 00:33.570
She'd been missing 18 hours?

00:33.580 --> 00:34.740
That's correct.

00:34.750 --> 00:37.370
We found the body 5 hours ago.

00:38.790 --> 00:40.180
The parents have been
here all this time?

00:40.190 --> 00:42.620
Yeah. And I'm running out of excuses.

00:42.630 --> 00:44.010
I'm gonna go talk to them.

00:44.020 --> 00:46.230
- J.J.,I'll come with you.
- Thanks.

00:47.620 --> 00:49.110
I gotta be honest,guys.

00:49.120 --> 00:52.060
I'm glad you're all here,because I
have never seen anything like that.

00:52.070 --> 00:54.410
Her face and her hands
have been obliterated.

00:55.090 --> 00:57.160
Bruce and i were out for dinner.

00:57.170 --> 00:59.760
Jack dropped off the
girls at the movie theater.

00:59.770 --> 01:02.110
And I arranged to pick them
up,but they never came out.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.150
I went inside,but they weren't there.

01:04.160 --> 01:08.380
And an usher told me he saw them leave
the,uh,the theater halfway through the movie.

01:08.390 --> 01:09.960
Where'd they go?

01:09.970 --> 01:12.020
He said they went
outside for a cigarette.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.790
We didn't even know katie smoked.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.530
- Did he say if they came back inside?
- No.

01:16.540 --> 01:19.070
We've been here all day.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.300
Why won't they let us know who that is?

01:21.310 --> 01:24.800
'Cause they don't know
who it is. Do they?

01:24.810 --> 01:26.680
Why? What did they do to her?

01:26.690 --> 01:29.160
Look,until we know who it
is and what's happened,we--

01:29.170 --> 01:30.990
by "we" you mean the fbi,right?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.620
We're only here to help the
police find out who did this.

01:33.630 --> 01:36.860
Well,it's a little late
for that,don't you think?

01:39.190 --> 01:41.630
I'm pat mannan,jack's friend.

01:41.640 --> 01:43.500
His wife passed away a few years ago.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.750
Bindings cut deep into her flesh.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.890
And around her neck
there's heavy bruising.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.120
She was strangled to death.

02:06.130 --> 02:07.790
A belt was used.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.570
You can see the indentation
marks of a buckle.

02:10.580 --> 02:12.740
But why destroy her hands and face?

02:12.750 --> 02:14.960
It indicates she knew the attacker.

02:14.970 --> 02:16.090
By destroying her I.D.,

02:16.100 --> 02:20.060
They're hoping to delay you making a
connection between the victim and the unsub.

02:20.070 --> 02:22.020
It gives him time to get away.

02:22.030 --> 02:23.860
Do you think the other
girl's still alive?

02:23.870 --> 02:26.210
Until we find her body,we
should assume she is.

02:26.220 --> 02:28.440
One thing's for sure--
this is only the dump site.

02:28.450 --> 02:30.880
We need to figure out
where she was killed.

02:34.130 --> 02:36.810
And which girl we're looking for.

02:41.340 --> 02:43.180
Excuse me. Mrs. Owen?

02:43.190 --> 02:47.350
The message katie left-- would you
mind I see what we can make of it?

02:47.650 --> 02:49.360
Yes,of course.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.080
Thank you.

02:51.090 --> 02:52.490
Why?

02:52.500 --> 02:54.100
You said she made the call at 11:20.

02:54.110 --> 02:56.600
It's possible katie was
with whoever took her.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.330
Mr. And mrs. Owen. Mr. Vaughan.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.990
I'm sorry,but we're gonna have to
move the body for further examination.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.100
You know,I can identify her.

03:06.110 --> 03:08.690
I'll know if it's katie or lindsey.

03:08.700 --> 03:09.740
I can do it.

03:09.750 --> 03:14.730
Until we find something conclusive,I
would advise against that.

03:17.010 --> 03:17.720
Garcia.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.310
Hey,angelfish.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.780
Right back at ya. I got a
cell phone number for you.

03:21.790 --> 03:24.810
619-555-0199.

03:24.820 --> 03:26.110
Access the last message left.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.630
I need you to put it through a filter.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.860
So can do,but it will
require all my faculties.

03:29.870 --> 03:31.710
I'll call you back in a sec.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.150
Please,no,please. Please stop it!

03:54.160 --> 03:55.450
Stop it! Stop it!

03:55.460 --> 03:56.970
Don't fight them. Don't!

03:57.450 --> 03:59.320
Oh,please,god,stop!

03:59.330 --> 04:00.410
Don't show them you're scared.

04:09.420 --> 04:11.740
Daddy,help me,please!

04:12.070 --> 04:15.400
It lasts exactly 53
seconds,and then it goes dead.

04:14.230 --> 04:17.750
{\a6}CHULA VISTA POLICE DEPT.

04:15.410 --> 04:17.070
I think she was strangled.

04:18.550 --> 04:19.730
What do you want to do?

04:19.910 --> 04:22.520
Do?There's nothing
else to do--

04:22.530 --> 04:24.260
the parents can I.D.The voice.

04:24.270 --> 04:25.280
Are you serious?

04:25.290 --> 04:27.200
No,no,sir,they can never hear this.

04:27.210 --> 04:30.480
It'll be the fastest way to
figure out who we're looking for.

04:30.490 --> 04:32.010
There's gotta be another way.

04:32.020 --> 04:33.590
Dna?

04:36.100 --> 04:40.810
LINGTHY TORTURE  FLESH CUTS

04:43.070 --> 04:45.240
My feeling is by the time
we got the results back,

04:45.250 --> 04:48.710
it would be too late to
save whoever they still have.

04:50.730 --> 04:51.960
It's up to you.

04:51.970 --> 04:54.010
This message,what did it record?

04:54.020 --> 04:55.390
It's the...

04:55.400 --> 04:58.340
last moments of one of
your daughters' lives.

04:58.350 --> 05:00.210
Oh,my god.

05:02.220 --> 05:05.220
If you choose to wait,you can
make a public appeal to the media.

05:05.230 --> 05:08.010
Either way,we're still looking
for one of your daughters.

05:08.020 --> 05:11.190
Live app-ieal- don't think
that's a good idea,jack.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.060
Why not?

05:12.070 --> 05:17.150
Because we know they're set up to see the
reaction of the parent,check for signs of guilt.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.390
Is that true?

05:20.400 --> 05:22.190
In some cases.

05:22.640 --> 05:26.210
I'm sorry,bruce,I can't
do this. I'M...sorry.

05:40.250 --> 05:41.920
Go ahead,garcia.

05:43.990 --> 05:46.060
Please,please. Please,no,please.

05:46.070 --> 05:48.900
Please,stop it! Stop it!Stop it!

05:48.910 --> 05:50.500
Don't fight them. Don'T.

05:50.510 --> 05:52.800
Oh,please,god,stop.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.070
Don't show them you're scared.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.900
Get off of me.

05:55.910 --> 05:59.330
Please,help me! Please,god!Stop it!

05:59.340 --> 06:02.600
Daddy,help me,please! Please...

Mr. Owen...

06:55.740 --> 06:57.960
that's not katie. I know her voice.

06:57.970 --> 07:00.030
That's not her. That's not katie.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.270
Bruce.

07:01.850 --> 07:03.940
Mrs. Owen,I'm so sorry.

07:04.940 --> 07:08.380
No. No,lori,it's ok.

07:08.390 --> 07:09.930
It's not her.

07:10.350 --> 07:11.070
Bruce...

07:11.080 --> 07:13.330
no,jack. Jack.

07:13.340 --> 07:15.280
Jack,it's not katie,right?

07:15.290 --> 07:16.370
- You know--
- bruce.

07:16.380 --> 07:19.220
Jack,it's not katie.

07:20.420 --> 07:21.990
- It's katie.
- No.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.440
No,it's not.

07:23.450 --> 07:24.990
Jack,please...

07:28.490 --> 07:29.500
Come on.

07:34.460 --> 07:36.600
I want lindsey's picture everywhere.

07:38.180 --> 07:40.660
What they did to katie took a long time.

07:40.670 --> 07:42.930
It was very violent and
we know katie screamed.

07:42.940 --> 07:47.420
Yet no calls from
complaining neighbors.Why?

07:47.430 --> 07:48.350
They're weren't any.

07:48.360 --> 07:52.950
The abduction site is 9 miles north
of the dump site on the edge of town.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.490
Both are indicators of a comfort zone,

07:54.500 --> 07:58.160
so I'm assuming the kill site is
somewhere between these 2 points.

07:58.170 --> 07:59.450
That's a wide area.

07:59.460 --> 08:00.100
Do a grid search.

08:00.110 --> 08:03.350
Narrow it down to wooded
areas,industrial sites,abandoned houses.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.910
He needed privacy and he
needed a controlled environment.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.730
What's critical right now
is a heavy police presence.

08:08.740 --> 08:12.520
Rossi,in the morning I want you,reid,morgan
to go in and search jack vaughan's house.

08:12.530 --> 08:16.280
Prentiss,you and I will go to
where the girls were last seen.

08:19.230 --> 08:23.030
Prentiss: 2 girls missing,one dead,and
life goes on as though nothing happened.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.430
Holiday weekend. What do you expect?

08:25.440 --> 08:27.630
A sense that something's changed.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.390
Do we know what movie they saw?

08:29.400 --> 08:32.340
Whatever it was,they left halfway
through to have a cigarette.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.130
What do you think they're talking about?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.679
Boys.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.340
Think their parents know they smoke?

08:38.350 --> 08:39.280
Mine didn'T.

08:39.289 --> 08:41.669
And if they saw me
dressed like that--ho ho.

08:41.679 --> 08:46.690
Two teenage girls free of parents,breaking
the rules,and dressed like that for a reason.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.680
Here comes the reason.

08:51.410 --> 08:53.110
They obviously don't know them.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.630
But they want to.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.220
Do you think they'll go with them?

08:56.230 --> 08:58.940
Since news of katie's death? No.

09:00.110 --> 09:01.670
See?

09:02.230 --> 09:04.410
So,brightly lit. No alleys.

09:04.420 --> 09:06.440
Wide-open holiday weekend.

09:06.450 --> 09:09.310
Hard to abduct 2 girls
without being seen.

09:09.320 --> 09:12.260
Unless they knew whoever took them.

09:20.140 --> 09:22.560
Jack Vaughan's Residence CHULA VISTA,CA

09:22.590 --> 09:24.600
What happened to lindsey's mother?

09:24.610 --> 09:25.810
Does it matter?

09:25.820 --> 09:27.550
It does to lindsey.

09:27.560 --> 09:28.660
It's called victimology.

09:28.670 --> 09:31.120
It helps us understand
more about lindsey.

09:31.130 --> 09:31.850
How?

09:31.860 --> 09:33.300
How she carries herself.

09:33.310 --> 09:35.080
How she interacts socially with others.

09:35.090 --> 09:37.140
She's just like any
other 15-year-old.

09:37.150 --> 09:38.920
No,she's not.

09:38.930 --> 09:39.800
I'm sorry?

09:39.810 --> 09:43.070
Everything in our house is an
externalization of ourselves.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.760
This room isn't what you'd
expect of a teenage girl.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.990
No J.T.Posters.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.330
No framed pictures.

09:49.340 --> 09:51.500
No journals,no cuddly toys.

09:51.510 --> 09:53.090
The walls are a mute tone.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.570
All this suggests that
lindsey keeps herself hidden.

09:55.580 --> 09:57.320
She's shy and...

09:57.330 --> 09:58.870
shares very little with others.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.070
Except to one
person-- katie.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.010
Garcia?

10:06.380 --> 10:08.510
All that from this room,huh?

10:08.520 --> 10:10.270
Is he wrong?

10:10.690 --> 10:14.810
Her dad,jack,he-- he never lets
up. I mean,he doesn't let her...

10:14.820 --> 10:17.500
reid,I ran a check on the folks
involved in the search. All good.

10:17.510 --> 10:19.110
Nice neighborhood,no sexual offenders.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.000
But,here's the big news.

10:21.010 --> 10:24.570
I found a blog katie
ran on faceplace.Tv.

10:24.580 --> 10:28.450
She talks a lot about lindsey,and,boy,she
did not like lindsey's dad.

10:28.460 --> 10:31.300
Cleans for him,and-- he treats
her like a wife,not a daughter.

10:31.310 --> 10:33.640
He's just-- he's
just a creep.

10:33.650 --> 10:36.140
Lindsey and jack moved to
chula vista 6 years ago.

10:36.150 --> 10:38.860
Up until 9,according to
katie,lindsey lived in maine.

10:38.870 --> 10:41.830
Jack owned a fishing boat with
his 3 brothers,mom stayed at home.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.690
But then,tragedy struck.

10:43.700 --> 10:46.580
Fish stock went down,dad
was forced to sell his boat,

10:46.590 --> 10:49.230
the family fell apart,mom
died in a car accident.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.620
It sounds familiar.

10:50.630 --> 10:51.260
It should.

10:51.270 --> 10:55.040
It's the exact life story of a girl named lindsey
in a book called the emerald sea of dreams.

10:55.050 --> 10:57.030
I've read it like 5 times.

10:57.800 --> 11:02.540
If lindsey stole her name and her story from a
book, why didn't her father say anything about it?

11:02.550 --> 11:05.680
And his computer's set to automatically
clear the web browser history

11:05.690 --> 11:08.630
and wipe the temp file on a daily basis.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.080
Give me his I.P.Address.

11:11.970 --> 11:14.170
374...

11:18.510 --> 11:19.710
Nothing.

11:19.990 --> 11:21.460
Must be using a gray box proxy server.

11:21.470 --> 11:23.790
It makes tracking his
internet history impossible.

11:25.250 --> 11:26.890
can I help you?

11:26.900 --> 11:27.840
Reid?

11:29.220 --> 11:32.700
I was just,uh,checking to see if lindsey
had contacted anyone on the internet.

11:32.710 --> 11:35.100
Predators tend to--
tend to do that.

11:35.110 --> 11:36.100
- Is that right?
- Yes.

11:36.110 --> 11:38.170
Statistically,actually,43%
of predators--

11:38.180 --> 11:40.100
lindsey doesn't like computers.

11:41.610 --> 11:42.850
Cool.

11:43.710 --> 11:44.840
Excuse me.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.280
Doesn't look much like a home.

11:53.290 --> 11:56.660
State-of-the-art security system,but
the furniture looks rented.

11:56.670 --> 11:58.860
The walls are bare of any real art.

11:58.870 --> 12:01.490
The shelves are devoid
of any family photos.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.960
Spyware wipes your
computer file history daily.

12:04.970 --> 12:06.110
Awhatre you getting at,agent?

12:06.120 --> 12:10.350
In the recording,katie said what you'd
expect of any teenager about to die.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.600
She begged for her life.

12:12.610 --> 12:15.370
Lindsey did exactly the opposite.

12:15.380 --> 12:16.760
Which is what?

12:16.770 --> 12:19.180
Lindsey's emotional
response and the--

12:19.190 --> 12:24.660
and the words that she chose to say in a
situation as violent as the one she faced...

12:25.130 --> 12:26.000
strongly
suggests--

12:26.010 --> 12:30.490
look--lindsey was either coached or
she's experienced sexual abuse before.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.310
You son of a bitch!

12:32.320 --> 12:33.960
No! Let me go!

12:33.970 --> 12:34.780
Gun!

12:34.790 --> 12:36.580
Put your hands where I
can see them,both of you!

12:36.590 --> 12:37.370
Do not move!

12:37.380 --> 12:38.490
Stop! Ok?

12:38.500 --> 12:40.390
Ok,just calm down.

12:41.420 --> 12:43.870
I'm gonna reach into my pocket...

12:44.490 --> 12:47.180
and I'm gonna take out a badge.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.480
Just calm down.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.780
Ok?

12:57.050 --> 12:59.100
United states marshal.

13:00.990 --> 13:03.280
Jack and lindsey are under my authority.

13:03.290 --> 13:04.700
Which is what?

13:04.710 --> 13:06.670
Witness protection.

14:12.460 --> 14:13.420
What's going on?

14:13.430 --> 14:15.230
I'm gonna go find out.

14:16.950 --> 14:17.690
What's wrong?

14:17.700 --> 14:20.110
It's nothing out of
the ordinary,mrs. Owen.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.640
Have they found lindsey?

14:21.650 --> 14:23.830
We haven't found lindsey,no.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.750
Now,why don't we all just go inside?

14:25.760 --> 14:26.930
No,I want to talk to jack.

14:26.940 --> 14:29.020
You can,as soon as they're done.

14:29.030 --> 14:31.710
You're trying to keep
me away from jack. Why?

14:38.340 --> 14:39.910
What's going on?

14:39.920 --> 14:41.700
Jack's in witness protection.

14:41.710 --> 14:44.130
10 years. Must be real important.

14:44.140 --> 14:45.920
Why didn't you tell us immediately?

14:45.930 --> 14:51.220
Because he's a state's witness whose
identity needs to be protected at all costs.

14:51.910 --> 14:54.840
You know,jack,this may not
have anything to do with--

14:54.850 --> 14:56.980
- with what?
- His past?

14:57.330 --> 15:02.920
Jack,every person in this room,with the
exception of him,is here for your daughter.

15:08.160 --> 15:11.990
If this does have anything to do with
me,they'll be coming out of boston.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.740
Irish-american. 2 or more men.

15:15.060 --> 15:18.230
Let's get them back to the station
and keep them there until this is over.

15:23.860 --> 15:28.840
Hey,you know,you have no idea who
or what you're dealing with here.

15:28.850 --> 15:32.470
Then enlighten me or stay out of my way.

15:37.330 --> 15:38.060
He's under arrest?

15:38.070 --> 15:39.510
No,he's not under arrest.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.270
Mr. Owen,please don't make
this harder than it is.

15:41.280 --> 15:41.890
You're lying to me.

15:41.900 --> 15:42.470
Jack?

15:42.480 --> 15:43.920
- Rossi.
- Mr. Owen,please calm down.

15:43.930 --> 15:45.760
Let go of me. What's going on?

15:45.770 --> 15:47.470
I want to know what he did to my katie.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.470
Ok,first you need
to calm down--

15:48.480 --> 15:50.360
don't tell me to calm down.

15:50.370 --> 15:51.450
Why are you arresting him?

15:51.460 --> 15:53.120
Sir,we're just asking
him questions. That's it.

15:53.130 --> 15:54.010
Jack!

15:54.020 --> 15:57.940
If you had anything to do with
this,I swear,I will kill you!

15:57.950 --> 16:00.890
That's enough,sir! That's enough.

16:15.510 --> 16:16.770
Garcia.

16:17.060 --> 16:17.930
Sir.

16:19.040 --> 16:22.300
I need you to check flights for
the last 72 hours into san diego,

16:22.310 --> 16:24.330
orange county,and
private airports as well.

16:24.340 --> 16:27.740
We're looking for one,maybe 2
men,possibly irish,out of boston.

16:27.750 --> 16:28.560
I got it.

16:28.570 --> 16:31.850
Checks motels,hotels,car
rentals,everything you can.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.410
I've interviewed hundreds of killers.

16:37.190 --> 16:42.050
All types of crazy motives
for doing what they did.

16:43.460 --> 16:47.010
They all share one thing
in common. All of them.

16:49.730 --> 16:52.060
It's in their eyes.

16:55.420 --> 17:00.050
Until what they hold
most precious is gone...

17:02.430 --> 17:04.130
and then they're lost.

17:07.290 --> 17:09.079
Just like the rest of us.

17:12.980 --> 17:14.319
Shut up.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.770
Shut up.

17:18.890 --> 17:20.420
Shut up!

17:22.550 --> 17:24.339
You stop!

17:31.160 --> 17:32.530
shut up.

17:51.110 --> 17:56.040
You could have just asked.
I would have turned it off.

18:03.890 --> 18:05.740
You don't know,do you...

18:06.620 --> 18:08.300
who I am?

18:12.160 --> 18:17.520
But I know who you are... lindsey.

18:20.460 --> 18:23.620
And now you know who I am...

18:25.770 --> 18:27.680
and what I can do...

18:28.160 --> 18:29.990
what I will do...

18:30.900 --> 18:33.170
if you don't shut up!

18:39.830 --> 18:42.970
one way or another,you're gonna die.

18:45.860 --> 18:47.710
Ladies first.

19:04.690 --> 19:06.660
Who do you work for?

19:06.670 --> 19:09.170
The mccrelan corporation,from boston.

19:09.180 --> 19:11.020
I love how you guys sell that.

19:11.030 --> 19:12.700
By "corporation," you
mean the mob,don't you?

19:12.710 --> 19:14.280
No one's been able to
get anything on them.

19:14.290 --> 19:15.230
Until now.

19:15.240 --> 19:18.850
That's because they murdered anyone who was
a threat to them,civilians and cops alike.

19:18.860 --> 19:22.050
Is that what you did,jack?
Did you eliminate the threat?

19:23.600 --> 19:27.110
Do those pills help the memories,or
do they just hide the real jack?

19:27.950 --> 19:30.930
The only thing that
keeps me alive is lindsey.

19:31.610 --> 19:34.960
What they did to katie,do you
think that was a message to you?

19:36.320 --> 19:37.480
If it is,it's working.

19:37.490 --> 19:39.790
Do you recognize the method?

19:39.800 --> 19:41.340
I didn't send messages.

19:41.350 --> 19:43.490
I just went straight to the source.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.660
In 2 weeks' time,the mccrelan
brothers will face trial.

19:46.670 --> 19:49.130
It looks like the
mccrelans are gonna walk.

19:49.140 --> 19:50.250
Where?

19:50.810 --> 19:52.280
All right. Thanks.

19:52.290 --> 19:53.180
You were right.

19:53.190 --> 19:55.190
We just found something
in an abandoned house.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.100
Lindsey?

19:56.110 --> 19:57.770
Where,exactly?

19:59.360 --> 20:00.320
Here.

20:00.330 --> 20:01.710
On the outskirts of town.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.360
It's still in the comfort zone.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.240
What does that mean?

20:04.250 --> 20:06.440
It means the unsubs
are local. Still here.

20:06.450 --> 20:07.610
Let's go.

20:07.990 --> 20:09.400
Agent hotchner.

20:09.970 --> 20:12.500
Whatever you find,I want to see her.

20:35.190 --> 20:36.820
What is it to the dump site,5 miles?

20:36.830 --> 20:39.080
- 6.2 miles south.
- Why?

20:39.090 --> 20:41.330
Why didn't they dump katie's
body on the other side of town?

20:41.340 --> 20:44.780
And risk heading out on the open road while
everyone was out looking for the girls.

20:44.790 --> 20:46.960
Something forced them to move on.

21:13.660 --> 21:15.310
Katie's cell phone.

21:16.030 --> 21:18.220
2 different sets of footprints.

21:18.230 --> 21:19.430
2 unsubs.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.020
Jack said there'd be 2 of them.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.550
There's cigarette butts everywhere.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.960
For professionals,this is a real mess.

21:24.970 --> 21:27.010
Multiple beer and liquor bottles.

21:27.020 --> 21:30.750
This could be the belt
they used to strangle katie.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.190
You'd think they'd just want
to do the job and move on.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.460
They're sending a message.

21:34.470 --> 21:37.010
Why obliterate the
I.D. And hide the body?

21:37.020 --> 21:39.150
Why not go straight to the source?

21:39.160 --> 21:42.440
Garcia checked all the names
against the ice database and nothing.

21:42.450 --> 21:45.240
Katie and lindsey may have left the
movie theater of their own free will,

21:45.250 --> 21:47.430
but they sure didn't
count on coming here.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.660
So this has nothing to do with the mob?

21:49.670 --> 21:53.050
Hey,guys,this blood trail goes
all the way out the back here.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.690
Must have run out this way.

22:02.700 --> 22:04.130
Maybe it was lindsey.

22:04.140 --> 22:07.100
Well,whoever it was,they
lost a lot of blood.

22:07.110 --> 22:09.030
It's thinner the further we go.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.020
It's an arterial bleed.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.600
And it stops here.

22:14.130 --> 22:17.030
Ok,spread out. Search the
grounds and every house.

23:18.040 --> 23:21.400
Guys,the last house on the
left,second floor. I've got something.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.110
He was stabbed 3 times.

23:50.100 --> 23:51.710
Look at his face.

23:51.720 --> 23:54.600
Scratch marks.Both arms.

23:54.610 --> 23:57.980
And on his hand a bite mark.
These are all defensive wounds.

23:58.650 --> 24:03.290
At some point for him,things got
out of hand and he wanted out.

24:03.300 --> 24:06.320
And whoever he was with wasn't
about to let that happen.

24:06.330 --> 24:08.450
He makes a run for it and...

24:08.460 --> 24:11.120
gets stabbed in the process.

24:11.130 --> 24:13.440
It's dark. They can't find him.

24:13.450 --> 24:17.690
They think he's gone to the police and they
have to think fast,so they take katie...

24:17.700 --> 24:19.320
and they dump her across town.

24:19.330 --> 24:24.470
And to maintain some amount
of control,they take lindsey.

24:25.970 --> 24:28.500
This is one of our unsubs.

24:28.510 --> 24:31.310
We just need to find his friends.

24:41.820 --> 24:43.430
A teenager did this?

24:43.440 --> 24:45.300
He was involved.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.840
So do you think she's still alive?

24:55.850 --> 24:57.370
I do.

24:57.380 --> 25:00.310
But I also think you
should let us do our job.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.320
Can you do that?

25:14.000 --> 25:17.850
Like I said,jack,this has
nothing to do with you.

25:17.860 --> 25:19.200
Nothing to do with me.

25:19.210 --> 25:21.780
This punk kid took my daughter.

25:24.250 --> 25:30.180
All this,jack,it's karma,for
what you did to all those people.

25:34.240 --> 25:37.550
Defensive wounds,bite indentations,scratch
marks on his face,hands,

25:37.560 --> 25:41.740
and arms all indicate that he was involved in
the murder and abduction of katie and lindsey.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.050
He's just a teenager.

25:43.060 --> 25:45.000
So were the lords of chaos.

25:45.010 --> 25:48.630
3 teenagers bewitched by
a boy named kevin foster.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.990
Kevin persuaded his friends to
murder their own high-school teacher.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.720
Social dynamics of teenage boys.

25:54.730 --> 25:57.850
In this case,intoxicated
by drugs and alcohol.

25:58.130 --> 26:01.130
When worked up into a
frenzy by a dominant male,

26:01.140 --> 26:05.750
the adolescent mind can be pushed past
what the adult mind perceives as acceptable.

26:05.760 --> 26:08.280
Hotch: What started out as
a good time quickly devolved,

26:08.290 --> 26:12.280
and katie fell victim to the violent
drunken rage of a juvenile gang.

26:12.290 --> 26:17.230
Check every high school in the chula vista
area,males between the ages of 15 and 18.

26:17.510 --> 26:18.820
Ok.

26:21.400 --> 26:25.720
chula vista has 7 public schools and 3 private
schools,so I'm gonna need more than that.

26:25.730 --> 26:27.340
Uh,let's see here.

26:27.350 --> 26:31.620
Brown hair,5'9",approximately
142 pounds.

26:31.950 --> 26:32.830
More.

26:32.840 --> 26:35.020
Most of the activity's in
the southeastern district.

26:35.030 --> 26:38.590
The socio-economic dynamic's
predominantly working class.

26:39.130 --> 26:42.570
Look within a 3-mile radius
of the castle park area.

26:43.230 --> 26:44.270
2 high schools.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.970
Start with the largest.

26:45.980 --> 26:48.060
Ok,let's see what we got.

26:52.280 --> 26:54.350
I got,like,5 faces.

26:57.120 --> 26:58.720
Jinkies.

26:59.500 --> 27:03.600
We believe this unsub
got scared and wanted out.

27:03.610 --> 27:07.490
And the dominant male,in order
to maintain control,attacked him.

27:07.500 --> 27:11.000
Douglas silverman,18 years old.

27:13.960 --> 27:19.200
We need to interview kids in his
class,parents,teachers,find out who his friends were.

27:19.210 --> 27:21.380
It's at least 2 or more boys.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.970
One older,early to mid-20s.

27:23.980 --> 27:28.080
He'll think of himself as a real badass,somebody
who broke the rules,defied the system.

27:28.090 --> 27:31.970
And have flunked or gotten kicked out
of high school,possibly the same one.

27:31.980 --> 27:34.910
He'll also have a record--
petty theft,larceny.

27:34.920 --> 27:38.160
But douglas silverman's been missing
for 2 days. How come no one's called?

27:38.170 --> 27:39.290
It's a 3-day weekend.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.930
His parents are out of
town,or he called,said he's ok.

27:41.940 --> 27:47.070
And now that the weekend's over,I can tell you
with what's happened,it's gonna end violently.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.220
We still got a chance
to get out of this.

27:50.230 --> 27:52.050
After what you did? What chance?

27:52.060 --> 27:53.530
What you did,too. Remember?

27:53.540 --> 27:54.560
I didn't kill her.

27:54.570 --> 27:56.200
Says who,huh? You?

27:56.210 --> 27:57.900
It's your word against mine,bud.

27:58.330 --> 27:59.860
I just want this to end.

27:59.870 --> 28:03.560
It will,all right? You just gotta
relax and you gotta trust me.

28:03.930 --> 28:05.230
What do we do?

28:05.240 --> 28:07.160
We got something they want.

28:07.170 --> 28:08.920
Now we just need a gun.

28:09.010 --> 28:09.970
What? A gun?

28:09.980 --> 28:11.040
Where are we gonna get that from?

28:11.050 --> 28:12.580
You said that your
old man had one,right?

28:12.590 --> 28:13.890
- He let you shoot it one time?
- No.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.170
No,no way. I'm not doing it.

28:15.180 --> 28:18.220
Listen,we can get out of
this. We have her.All right?

28:18.230 --> 28:19.810
Go get the gun.

28:29.420 --> 28:31.610
You really are as dumb as you look.

28:37.810 --> 28:40.120
You're forgetting one thing.

28:42.290 --> 28:44.170
I saw what you did.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.700
Don't matter.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.990
'Cause none of us are walking away.

29:05.380 --> 29:06.570
What is it?

29:20.260 --> 29:21.220
How can I help you?

29:21.230 --> 29:22.860
- Mr. Silverman?
- Yeah.

29:22.870 --> 29:24.300
I'm ssa hotchner.

29:24.310 --> 29:26.360
This is ssa prentiss.

29:26.770 --> 29:28.510
- Is there someplace we can talk?
- We can talk here.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.900
- It would be better
if- - what's this about?

29:31.420 --> 29:33.210
It's about your son doug.

29:33.220 --> 29:34.370
My son doug?

29:34.380 --> 29:37.150
When was the last time you spoke to him?

29:38.340 --> 29:40.970
Well,hang on. I can
call him for you here.

29:41.460 --> 29:43.830
Sir,he's not going to answer.

29:46.890 --> 29:48.140
Sir.

29:52.530 --> 29:54.160
His name's doug silverman.

29:54.170 --> 29:56.930
He went to the same high
school as katie and lindsey.

29:58.230 --> 30:01.050
Maybe. I don't know.

30:01.310 --> 30:03.000
Why? Has he got
something to do with this?

30:03.010 --> 30:05.570
All we know right now
is he was involved.

30:05.580 --> 30:06.570
There are others.

30:06.580 --> 30:10.090
- So this has nothing to do with jack.
- No.

30:11.580 --> 30:17.350
Why,I vetted every boy that came into katie's
life,made sure I knew everything about them.

30:17.670 --> 30:18.940
I had to.

30:18.950 --> 30:21.590
I can't afford to forget a
face. His I've never seen.

30:21.600 --> 30:27.800
Maybe these guys,she didn't want you to
meet,afraid of what you might say or do.

30:27.810 --> 30:29.670
Lindsey and i don't have any secrets.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.490
That's not quite true,though,is it?

30:31.500 --> 30:35.820
No,it is true. She knows
who I am,what I was.

30:36.490 --> 30:39.830
10 years ago your wife
died in a car accident.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.610
Is that why you turned state witness?

30:42.870 --> 30:45.010
I promised my wife on her death bed that

30:45.020 --> 30:49.460
I would do whatever was
necessary to protect lindsey.

30:49.470 --> 30:54.770
Did you tell lindsey it was supposed
to be you in that car and not her mom?

30:57.210 --> 30:58.510
Yes.

30:59.080 --> 31:02.870
Why,then,with all that you taught her,would
she allow herself to get caught up in this?

31:02.880 --> 31:04.290
She wouldn'T.

31:04.300 --> 31:06.560
What about katie?

31:07.330 --> 31:08.980
Boys suck.

31:08.990 --> 31:11.370
Especially at my
school. They're all so...

31:11.380 --> 31:13.120
busy being busy.

31:13.580 --> 31:16.030
There's this one guy,though. Real cute.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.570
Hangs out with 2 dweebs.

31:17.580 --> 31:20.820
But lindsey says to stay away from him.

31:21.550 --> 31:22.130
Go.

31:22.140 --> 31:26.690
Back to high school boys who flunked
out or got kicked out. Go back 10 years.

31:27.590 --> 31:30.470
Lindsey says there's-- there's
something not right about him.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.620
I think katie's talking
about him right now.

31:32.630 --> 31:34.080
Thanks,garcia.

31:34.090 --> 31:36.980
But she's never met him. I don't know.

31:38.390 --> 31:41.260
Where are you,you son of a bitch?

31:43.120 --> 31:45.190
No,no,no,he wouldn't do this.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.160
He did what he was told to do.

31:47.170 --> 31:48.610
Oh,wait. What was he told?

31:48.620 --> 31:51.380
I mean,doug is a real shy guy,ok?

31:51.390 --> 31:53.390
He doesn't make friends easy.

31:53.400 --> 31:56.350
Has he changed recently,become
a little more defiant?

31:56.360 --> 31:58.220
His grades slipping?

32:00.120 --> 32:01.760
I thought it was just a phase.

32:01.770 --> 32:06.480
A phase manipulated by someone who
targeted your son for his own needs.

32:10.070 --> 32:12.500
Did he ever mention anyone to you?

32:13.500 --> 32:15.020
Oh,god.

32:20.770 --> 32:23.810
A couple of months
ago,there was this older kid.

32:23.820 --> 32:28.160
I--I said invite him over for
supper and he didn't want to.

32:29.850 --> 32:31.320
Ryan.

32:31.740 --> 32:34.850
Ryan. I don't know.

32:35.330 --> 32:36.900
Oh,god.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.730
How am I gonna tell his mom?

32:45.550 --> 32:49.150
Lindsey protected katie
like a--like a sister.

32:49.160 --> 32:54.300
So if a few boys pulled up
curbside and offered katie a ride?

32:54.310 --> 32:58.260
Lindsey would have gone
along to make sure she was ok.

32:58.270 --> 33:01.690
Lindsey is still alive
because of what you taught her.

33:01.700 --> 33:04.850
I taught her to stay
away from men like me.

33:08.240 --> 33:13.100
I'd like to speak to jack
if I may,to apologize.

33:15.210 --> 33:16.660
Sure.

33:34.060 --> 33:36.240
5 years we've known each other.

33:36.250 --> 33:39.210
No...

33:40.190 --> 33:43.540
- Bruce,I'm so sorry.
- Just...listen,please.

33:44.140 --> 33:46.850
I don't know who you
are or what you've done.

33:47.340 --> 33:51.630
All I want to know is,are you capable
of still doing whatever it is you did?

33:51.950 --> 33:53.450
Why?

33:55.310 --> 33:57.660
That dead kid up there...

33:58.430 --> 34:00.610
I know who he is.

34:01.200 --> 34:04.470
I know who he hangs out with.

34:05.670 --> 34:06.850
Garcia: Ok,I got 3 ryans.

34:06.860 --> 34:10.159
The ryan we're looking for probably went to high
school with lindsey and katie a few years back.

34:10.170 --> 34:12.340
He got expelled or at least flunked out.

34:12.350 --> 34:15.639
Ryan phillips. He was expelled
for smoking pot years ago.

34:20.199 --> 34:21.139
Oh,no.

34:21.150 --> 34:23.340
- Reid,what's going on?
- He's taken my car.

34:23.780 --> 34:25.750
The bastard took my car.

34:26.770 --> 34:28.040
This is pat mannan.

34:28.050 --> 34:32.100
All units,all units,I want
an apb out on jack vaughan.

34:45.699 --> 34:46.800
Jack's taken off.

34:46.810 --> 34:47.780
We heard.

34:48.159 --> 34:50.120
Where's he gonna go? He
can't know where lindsey is.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.659
- No,but he might know who's got her.
- How?

34:53.080 --> 34:55.179
You showed bruce owen
doug's photo,right?

34:55.190 --> 34:56.449
He recognized it.

34:56.460 --> 34:57.930
Which means he knows
who doug's friends are.

34:57.940 --> 35:00.330
So now he's sent a psychopath
after his daughter's killer.

35:00.340 --> 35:01.350
Garcia's got a name.

35:01.360 --> 35:02.810
Ryan phillips,28.

35:02.820 --> 35:05.610
Needs get a unit over to phillips'
house before jack turns up there.

35:05.620 --> 35:07.960
On thing's for sure-- we
know ryan won't be there.

35:07.970 --> 35:10.740
We'd better figure out
where he is before jack does.

35:11.170 --> 35:14.350
Come on. Come on,damn it.

35:20.870 --> 35:21.960
You need a hand with that?

35:21.970 --> 35:22.920
Who the hell are you?

35:22.930 --> 35:24.100
I'm mr. Vaughan.

35:24.110 --> 35:26.460
- What are you doing in my house?
- Lindsey.

35:26.470 --> 35:27.400
Where's my daughter?

35:27.410 --> 35:29.480
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah?

35:30.190 --> 35:31.170
I think you do.

35:32.020 --> 35:33.720
Hey,what are you doing? Stop!

35:35.220 --> 35:37.280
Get out of my house! What are you doing?

35:40.270 --> 35:41.600
This thing's not loaded,is it?

35:41.610 --> 35:43.050
What are you doing?

35:49.730 --> 35:53.180
Oh,god! Oh,god,you shot my leg.

35:54.210 --> 35:57.450
You got 2 legs. I got one question.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.500
Where's my daughter?

36:00.090 --> 36:01.430
You gotta find him,and fast.

36:01.440 --> 36:02.290
What does it look like I'm doing?

36:02.300 --> 36:03.260
Coloring in a map.

36:03.270 --> 36:05.460
All the activity is focused
in the southeastern district.

36:05.470 --> 36:08.600
The abduction site,the dump
site,ryan phillips' house.

36:08.610 --> 36:11.330
There's gunshots coming
from jackson street.

36:12.620 --> 36:14.330
Are you coming?

36:19.480 --> 36:22.710
3-day weekend,you've gotta find
a secure,private location. Where?

36:22.720 --> 36:25.150
Army of cops and feds all over
town. It's gonna be real hard.

36:25.160 --> 36:28.320
Every abandoned building,warehouse,lockups--
it's all been searched.

36:28.330 --> 36:31.050
Guys,it seems jack just paid a
kid named taylor coleman a visit.

36:31.060 --> 36:33.010
Paramedics are working on him now.

36:33.020 --> 36:34.510
Reid,good news,please.

36:34.520 --> 36:35.500
After inputting all the sites,

36:35.510 --> 36:40.590
I've come up with a 2-dimensional probability service
overlay map that indicates the offenders' operating eaar.

36:40.600 --> 36:41.790
Reid,where is he?

36:41.800 --> 36:46.050
I know it sounds crazy,but I think he's taken
her to the mayford high school 2 blocks from here.

36:46.060 --> 36:48.870
I'll meet you there,and
reid...Be careful.

36:48.880 --> 36:49.820
thanks.

36:49.830 --> 36:51.310
Mayford high school.

36:56.570 --> 36:58.350
Damn it,pick up the phone!

36:58.360 --> 37:00.340
He's not coming back,ryan.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.430
What are you gonna do now?

37:06.750 --> 37:08.910
Looks like it's just you and me.

37:16.820 --> 37:18.600
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

37:20.930 --> 37:23.740
It's something I've been
meaning to do all along.

38:11.820 --> 38:16.400
See,I wasn't really
that into katie. You.

38:18.340 --> 38:20.680
There's something special about you.

38:21.670 --> 38:23.230
Where you goin',baby?

38:33.940 --> 38:38.770
What you do to me will be nothing
compared to what my dad will do to you.

38:39.620 --> 38:41.240
I'm scared.

38:46.640 --> 38:47.650
Go on,daddy,kill him!

38:47.660 --> 38:50.820
You son of a bitch,you
killed her! He killed katie.

38:52.800 --> 38:55.060
Kill him! Kill him,daddy!

38:56.400 --> 38:58.530
- Put the gun down!
- Please!Please help me!

38:58.540 --> 39:00.460
Jack,put down the gun.

39:00.470 --> 39:02.610
She begged him to stop
and he laughed at her!

39:02.620 --> 39:03.470
He laughed at her!

39:03.480 --> 39:06.970
I didn't laugh at her. I
would change it if I could.

39:06.980 --> 39:08.500
But I can'T. Please...

39:08.510 --> 39:10.430
- just don't kill me.
- Jack...

39:11.810 --> 39:14.750
you swore to your wife
you'd protect lindsey.

39:16.100 --> 39:19.290
Listen to her,jack.
Listen to what she wants.

39:19.300 --> 39:22.970
She's-- she's begging you to kill
somebody right in front of her.

39:24.010 --> 39:27.020
What do you think your wife
wanted you to protect her from?

39:28.760 --> 39:30.320
Jack...

39:31.460 --> 39:33.450
your life has been,uh...

39:33.460 --> 39:35.970
it's been about violence,and if...

39:36.160 --> 39:40.400
you do this,lindsey's will be,too.

39:42.510 --> 39:44.440
Do you want that?

39:46.490 --> 39:48.600
No,you don't want that!

39:48.610 --> 39:50.840
When does it end,jack?

39:52.630 --> 39:55.060
- Put down the gun!
- Kill him.

39:55.550 --> 39:57.470
When does it stop?

39:58.580 --> 40:00.110
Tomorrow.

40:10.680 --> 40:12.590
I think it came from in here.

40:14.400 --> 40:15.130
Let's go.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.520
Hang back! Hang back!

40:51.310 --> 40:52.880
you ok,reid?

40:53.150 --> 40:55.310
I--I
tried.

40:55.860 --> 40:59.520
I tried,really. I couldn'T...

41:02.530 --> 41:04.590
what's gonna happen to jack?

41:05.210 --> 41:07.000
It depends...

41:07.530 --> 41:10.530
how important a witness he is.

41:47.810 --> 41:51.580
"It is a wise father
who knows his own child."

41:52.150 --> 41:53.730

42:13.580 --> 42:15.030

42:18.150 --> 42:19.690
It's jack.

42:23.490 --> 42:24.790
