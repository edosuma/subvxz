00:01.914 --> 00:02.872
<i>Last time on</i> Naomi.

00:02.915 --> 00:04.178
You knew my birth parents?

00:04.221 --> 00:06.006
A lot of bad things happened
back then.

00:06.049 --> 00:07.877
- I'm not used to this.
- Used to what?

00:07.920 --> 00:09.487
Having friends.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.837
War is coming,
I suggest you choose
the winning side.

00:11.881 --> 00:14.014
- Who the hell is Mac?
- She works for Brutus.

00:14.057 --> 00:16.799
<i>But I suspect that Brutus</i> <i>
has sent someone</i> <i>
more formidable.</i>

00:16.842 --> 00:19.062
<i>Julian trapped everyone</i> <i>
in here just to get to me.</i>

00:19.106 --> 00:21.499
<i>Superman stands</i> <i>
for truth and justice.</i>

00:21.543 --> 00:22.935
I'm not Superman.

00:22.979 --> 00:25.025
<i>No.
You're Naomi freaking McDuffie.</i>

00:25.068 --> 00:28.158
Wherever your destiny
is leading you,
I can't go with you.

00:28.202 --> 00:30.552
But I'll always be
on your side.

00:50.224 --> 00:51.616
How did Brutus find us?

00:51.660 --> 00:53.183
I don't know,
but we have to hurry.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.445
I don't know
if I can do this.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.578
We have to keep
Naomi safe.

01:21.951 --> 01:23.735
Hurry. We have to go now.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.486
Start the transport vessel.

01:41.275 --> 01:43.277
We're out of time. Go, go, go!

01:46.018 --> 01:47.281
There they are.

01:47.324 --> 01:48.630
Stop that ship!

02:10.782 --> 02:12.480
We can't go back
to Earth-29.

02:12.523 --> 02:14.569
What about one of
the planets in this universe?

02:14.612 --> 02:15.874
That's not
far enough away.

02:15.918 --> 02:17.354
If such a place
even exists.

02:17.398 --> 02:19.443
There's no
perfect option.

02:19.487 --> 02:20.618
I don't wanna leave.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.062
Everything I care about
is in Port Oswego.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.195
My friends are here.
My life is here.

02:32.239 --> 02:35.807
Do you know how long
it's taken me to find a place
that actually feels like home?

02:35.851 --> 02:38.767
We do know.
We hate that it's come to this,

02:38.810 --> 02:42.684
but after what happened
at the school,
we have no choice.

02:42.727 --> 02:45.469
Yes, we do.
We can stay, fight.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.210
Brutus won't stop, ever.

02:47.254 --> 02:51.301
He's ruthless,
and we have no idea
what he's planning next.

02:51.345 --> 02:55.392
What we do know is
sending Julian and Mac here
was an escalation.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.177
We have to get you
someplace safe, Naomi.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.918
But shouldn't I
get a say in this?
It's my life.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.618
We could try to find
the power source.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.753
What power source?

03:08.797 --> 03:10.059
It's nothing.

03:10.102 --> 03:11.191
A fantasy.

03:14.063 --> 03:15.412
We can't just give up.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.415
No one's giving up.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.678
This is about
buying you more time.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.072
To get stronger.

03:23.115 --> 03:26.467
Dee, you've seen me train.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.730
I'm getting stronger,
more skilled.

03:28.773 --> 03:30.645
You've made
great progress.

03:30.688 --> 03:33.691
But beings like Brutus
aren't easily stopped.

03:34.997 --> 03:35.911
You need more time.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.789
Zumbado, please.

03:44.833 --> 03:49.272
You said I was the key
to reuniting the 29.
You said it's my destiny.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.274
That's why you have to
leave, Naomi.

03:53.102 --> 03:54.886
I'm sorry.

03:54.930 --> 03:58.629
But your future,
the future of our planet
depends on you being alive.

04:01.458 --> 04:02.807
So I don't have a choice.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.988
Since when did the five of you
agree on literally anything?

04:10.032 --> 04:12.077
If all five of us agree,

04:12.121 --> 04:14.950
then you're smart enough
to realize that
this is important.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.606
We need you to trust us.

04:23.175 --> 04:24.612
I don't agree with this.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.483
But...

04:27.528 --> 04:28.790
I do trust you.

04:31.532 --> 04:34.012
So, if you say
this is the only way, then...

04:35.927 --> 04:36.841
I believe you.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.593
We've moved the pieces
from Naomi's transport vessel

04:49.637 --> 04:51.813
from the mill
to Akira's workspace.

04:53.641 --> 04:56.078
How long will it take you
to repair it?

04:56.121 --> 04:57.949
Couple days at most.

04:57.993 --> 05:00.517
Until then,
we all need to lay low.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.611
It's gonna be okay.

05:09.483 --> 05:10.658
I promise.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.848
Hi.

05:26.891 --> 05:29.372
This isn't the lunch room.

05:29.416 --> 05:32.027
- I wanted some alone time.
- Alone time?

05:32.070 --> 05:34.551
Who are you
and what have you
done with Naomi?

05:36.423 --> 05:38.642
If you're lonely
when you're alone,

05:38.686 --> 05:40.035
you're in bad company.

05:42.516 --> 05:43.778
Jean-Paul Sartre.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.041
AP Lit.

05:46.084 --> 05:47.259
Ugh.

05:47.303 --> 05:48.565
I... Right.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.480
I may have slept
through start of the week,

05:52.308 --> 05:55.355
And I don't blame you. Existentialism
can be hella boring.

05:55.398 --> 05:59.054
You know, for a minute there
I thought you might have
been avoiding

05:59.097 --> 06:02.623
the lunch table
full of soccer players
in the cafeteria,

06:05.626 --> 06:07.541
You heard about me
and Nathan.

06:10.631 --> 06:11.762
Curse of a small town.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.376
I'm sorry that happened.

06:17.289 --> 06:19.379
Thanks.

06:19.422 --> 06:22.382
But, I have something
that will cheer you right up.

06:22.425 --> 06:25.515
Sneak peek of next month's
school paper. Check it out.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.651
Wow, it's... It's great.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.957
Yeah, we're doing
a whole retrospective.

06:33.001 --> 06:36.439
We're gonna talk
to local business owners, eyewitnesses,

06:36.483 --> 06:38.398
even a couple
of conspiracy theorists.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.095
Conspiracy theorists?

06:40.138 --> 06:42.140
Why would there be
conspiracy theories
about Superman?

06:42.184 --> 06:45.013
So, apparently,
there are some people

06:45.056 --> 06:49.104
who think
that the Superman stunt
wasn't a stunt at all.

06:51.019 --> 06:52.586
They're saying
he's an alien.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.025
No, it seems
kind of far-fetched.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.940
Yeah, that's the...
That's the fun of it.

06:58.983 --> 07:01.551
I was also hoping
that I could interview you,

07:01.595 --> 07:05.903
and then we could do
a little cross-promotion
with your site.

07:05.947 --> 07:08.776
Actually, I've been,
kind of, taking a break
from my site.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.648
So...

07:11.692 --> 07:13.737
So, you don't want to talk
about Superman?

07:13.781 --> 07:15.435
And you're taking a break
from your site

07:15.478 --> 07:17.611
and you're hiding out
in a classroom.

07:19.569 --> 07:20.962
Is everything okay?

07:21.005 --> 07:22.616
Everything's fine.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.748
I just think that
the Superman thing is...

07:24.792 --> 07:27.490
It's old news.
Another topic
might be better.

07:29.057 --> 07:29.927
Oh.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.364
Uh...

07:32.408 --> 07:35.193
Yeah, I mean,
it's kind of too late
for that.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.586
But, that's...

07:36.630 --> 07:38.632
That's okay. Um...

07:40.590 --> 07:42.462
I should go. Um...

07:42.505 --> 07:43.767
I'll see you in class.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.987
Yeah, sure.
I'll see you in class.

08:17.627 --> 08:18.759
Naomi.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.544
You shouldn't be here.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.205
I felt something
when I touched it.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.034
What do you mean?

08:34.122 --> 08:35.079
I got this...

08:35.558 --> 08:37.517
flash.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.345
And I remember
being put in the pod.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.130
Has that happened to you often?

08:43.392 --> 08:45.046
The first time
was with Zumbado.

08:46.264 --> 08:47.701
I...

08:47.744 --> 08:50.312
saw our home planet

08:50.355 --> 08:52.836
and I felt his memories
like they were my own.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.143
Psionic powers.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.842
I didn't expect that.

08:59.626 --> 09:00.540
What are they?

09:00.583 --> 09:01.671
Uh...

09:02.542 --> 09:03.586
Memories.

09:04.413 --> 09:06.067
Premonitions.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.896
Psychic powers
are difficult to define.

09:08.939 --> 09:11.725
You have
a very powerful mind, Naomi.

09:15.946 --> 09:18.035
Powerful enough
to let me stay?

09:18.079 --> 09:21.299
That decision
has already been made.

09:21.343 --> 09:24.389
- But you don't agree with it.
- Irrelevant.

09:24.433 --> 09:28.611
Your parents, Dee, Zumbado,
they just want
what's best for you.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.395
I know that.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.789
But I think you know something
that can help me.

09:35.096 --> 09:36.140
Akira, please.

09:40.841 --> 09:44.758
There are many unique elements
in the multi-verse.

09:44.801 --> 09:45.976
Some of them
we know about,

09:46.020 --> 09:48.892
like kryptonite
or Nth metal.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.677
Others have yet
to be discovered.

09:52.069 --> 09:54.028
They are sources
of great power.

09:55.638 --> 10:00.338
It is rumored that
one such power source
might be on Earth.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.256
You think it could help me?

10:05.300 --> 10:07.215
I'm not certain, but yes.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.219
I think it can amplify
your powers.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.048
I could get stronger.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.746
Where is it?

10:16.790 --> 10:18.835
I have never been able
to find it.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.622
Perhaps I'm not meant to.

10:27.017 --> 10:30.934
Your mother was my friend.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.373
You remind me so much of her.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.987
I told myself that
I was keeping you safe.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.164
I wasn't sure
if you were ready. I...

10:47.472 --> 10:49.866
I should've given this
to you a long time ago.

10:51.476 --> 10:52.869
I've seen that locket before.

10:55.176 --> 10:58.396
I believe it's the key to
finding this source of power.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.930
You saw something,
didn't you?

11:09.973 --> 11:11.671
A field.
What does it mean?

11:11.714 --> 11:15.675
I don't know.
So much about the 29
remains a mystery.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.634
But I do know
there is no such thing
as a coincidence.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.071
Not when it comes to us.

11:21.115 --> 11:25.380
I believe the secrets
of that necklace
are yours to unlock.

11:37.261 --> 11:39.960
What's the point of a locket
if you can't even open it?

11:40.612 --> 11:42.005
I don't know.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.877
You know, I stayed up
all night analyzing it.

11:45.182 --> 11:48.142
The composition,
the construction, nothing.

11:48.185 --> 11:51.188
Have your minority report
flashes given you
any more clues?

11:51.232 --> 11:54.104
No, I just keep seeing
the same red field
with red flowers.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.192
Right.

11:55.236 --> 11:56.716
The frittata.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.848
The <i>fritillaria gentneri.</i>

12:00.850 --> 12:03.940
It's an endangered species
that only grows in one place
near Nevada.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.727
We should be there
in about four hours.

12:08.989 --> 12:11.208
Still can't believe Akira
is the weakest parent.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.906
I think we all had
our money on Dee.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.387
Thank you for coming
with me, Annabelle.

12:16.431 --> 12:19.390
Of course. I did not survive
babysitting Sophie

12:19.434 --> 12:22.742
to get driving privileges
just so you could
move to space.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.266
We are going to need
some fuel.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.486
All that frittata talk
is making me hungry.

12:28.530 --> 12:32.186
Oh, I've seen about
six billboards
for that diner.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.492
Apparently they have
the world's best fries.

12:35.580 --> 12:36.756
Then we have to go.

12:37.365 --> 12:38.279
For science.

12:49.464 --> 12:50.552
Hey, buddy.

12:50.595 --> 12:51.771
Nice shirt.

12:52.641 --> 12:53.773
It's laundry day,

12:53.816 --> 12:55.122
and you've never
called me "buddy,"

12:55.165 --> 12:56.819
which makes me think
you want something.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.299
Maybe I want to buy a comic.

12:58.952 --> 13:00.823
You don't like comics.

13:00.867 --> 13:04.784
Okay, maybe I just
want to say hi.
Have a nice little chat.

13:04.827 --> 13:09.266
Which I will then write down
for the next edition
of the POHS post.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.268
Why would you want
to interview me?

13:11.312 --> 13:14.837
Ah, well, I'm doing
a retrospective
on the Superman incident.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.927
I wanna see how
it's impacted your shop.

13:17.971 --> 13:21.148
You know, 'cause it's a...
It's a comic book store
and, uh...

13:21.888 --> 13:24.020
well, Superman.

13:24.064 --> 13:27.371
Yeah, I get that.
But why are you writing it?

13:27.415 --> 13:31.636
You've never cared
for comic books
or Superman.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.073
Uh, well, um...

13:34.509 --> 13:35.597
Oh.

13:36.467 --> 13:37.294
This is about Naomi.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.862
What?
No, it's not.

13:39.906 --> 13:43.126
Uh, it's nothing to do
with her recent breakup
with Nathan?

13:43.735 --> 13:44.824
What?

13:45.302 --> 13:46.216
No!

13:47.870 --> 13:50.003
Okay, maybe a little bit.

13:50.046 --> 13:55.182
But, it doesn't even matter
because she has zero interest
in talking to me about it.

13:55.225 --> 13:56.618
Which...

13:56.661 --> 13:58.359
Is weird, right?

13:58.402 --> 14:00.491
Mm, not really.

14:00.535 --> 14:03.886
I mean, not any weirder
than anything
she's been doing lately.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.018
What do you mean?

14:05.453 --> 14:06.846
Come on.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.979
You must have noticed,
she's off lately.

14:10.023 --> 14:12.242
All that stuff with a disc.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.984
Yeah, those markings
at the mill...

14:15.811 --> 14:18.379
and Camp Shadow Ridge.

14:18.422 --> 14:22.339
Her parents' anniversary party
ending with a trip to the base.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.255
Yeah. You know what,
you're right.

14:25.299 --> 14:28.868
Naomi has been acting
strange for a while.

14:29.738 --> 14:30.913
Ever since...

14:30.957 --> 14:32.306
The Superman thing.

14:34.612 --> 14:37.050
Did this interview just turn
into an investigation?

14:37.093 --> 14:39.922
It's time to find out
what's really going on
with our friend.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.576
Great!

14:41.619 --> 14:44.057
- Where do we start?
- At the beginning.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.276
With the guy who confessed
to planning the stunt.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.110
There is no
false advertisement here.

14:54.154 --> 14:55.895
World's best fries.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.899
There's something about
eating diner food
in a place like this.

14:59.942 --> 15:03.032
This milkshake
is even chocolatier
than the one at Murray's.

15:03.076 --> 15:04.947
Never tell them I said that.

15:04.991 --> 15:08.516
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

15:08.559 --> 15:12.215
<i>♪ Happy birthday</i> <i>
Dear Cheryl ♪</i>

15:12.259 --> 15:15.044
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

15:15.088 --> 15:16.437
Remember your 16th birthday?

15:16.480 --> 15:18.395
You tried to surprise me
at the bowling alley.

15:18.439 --> 15:21.050
While you were trying
to surprise me
at the skating rink.

15:21.094 --> 15:24.227
For our third BFF-versary,
a sacred occasion.

15:24.271 --> 15:27.796
If Jacob hadn't cracked,
we would have waited
for each other all day.

15:27.839 --> 15:31.626
Instead, we combo-ed
the parties and invented
roller bowling.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.978
Feels like
such a long time ago.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.633
Things were simpler back then.

15:40.678 --> 15:43.246
Simpler doesn't always
mean better.

15:44.334 --> 15:45.292
Naomi?

15:50.036 --> 15:52.864
You okay? Too much grease?
I knew we should have blotted.

15:52.908 --> 15:56.042
No. I just got another flash.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.521
We better head out of here.

15:57.565 --> 15:59.959
I am not about to argue
with the space locket.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.751
I still can't believe Zumbado
was able to salvage this.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.579
We caught a break.

16:11.622 --> 16:14.321
The ship is constructed
from an ethilium composite.
It's...

16:14.364 --> 16:17.019
Dynamic vibrational alloy.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.936
We came across it
in our research back home.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.026
You're trying
to re-endochronize
the ship fragments,

16:24.070 --> 16:27.464
regenerate and fuse
the damaged areas.

16:27.508 --> 16:31.207
That's the hope.
I'm sequencing
the molecular structure now.

16:31.251 --> 16:32.643
Shouldn't be long.

16:37.692 --> 16:39.650
Thank you...

16:39.694 --> 16:42.175
for helping us get
Naomi off this planet.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.526
We know you don't
agree with us.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.528
No, I don't.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.313
Running is a mistake.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.925
We're just trying
to keep our daughter safe.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.362
I don't doubt that.

16:55.405 --> 16:58.887
But Naomi
has a greater purpose.

16:58.930 --> 17:01.890
This is what Naomi's parents
would have wanted.

17:01.933 --> 17:05.024
Naomi's parents
loved our planet.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.069
They wanted to restore it.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.811
If they knew that she was
the key to doing that,
they would choose differently.

17:11.769 --> 17:15.121
Their choices are the reasons
they're not here right now.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.775
You don't know
what they went through.
They were my friends.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.429
They were ours, too.

17:19.473 --> 17:22.215
But they're not here.
We are.

17:23.738 --> 17:27.046
It's our job
to keep Naomi safe.
She's not ready.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.351
She's more ready
than you think.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.049
You don't even know her.

17:30.092 --> 17:33.661
I know she has the potential
to be stronger than any of us.

17:33.704 --> 17:37.708
Your fear is holding her back.
Running is not the answer.

17:40.015 --> 17:42.539
Who are you to lecture us?

17:42.583 --> 17:46.369
To you and Zumbado,
Naomi is nothing
but a means to an end.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.633
We're her parents.

17:49.677 --> 17:53.507
We have been there
every single minute
of every single day.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.640
All you've done
is run and hide.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.297
You might be right about me.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.605
But I am right about her.

18:12.961 --> 18:14.223
Sit anywhere you want.

18:17.705 --> 18:20.229
Hey, buddy.
Tips are for the servers.

18:42.556 --> 18:45.646
If we turn around now
and I push the upper limits
of the speeding law,

18:45.689 --> 18:46.995
we can make it home
before night.

18:47.038 --> 18:48.518
We're not going back,
not yet.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.346
You just had a vision
of a red-eyed smoke monster,

18:50.390 --> 18:52.827
and I'm not talking about
the fun kind from <i>Lost.</i>

18:52.870 --> 18:54.742
It was just a memory.

18:54.785 --> 18:56.265
But what if it wasn't?

18:58.789 --> 19:01.879
We can't just give up.
I have to find
the power source.

19:01.923 --> 19:05.535
Babe, you don't even
know if it exists
or what it might do.

19:05.579 --> 19:06.971
Maybe it's like Superman
and the sun,

19:07.015 --> 19:09.365
if I'm exposed to it,
it'll give me more power.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.454
You're putting a lot of faith
in a magic locket.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.720
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

19:18.853 --> 19:19.810
I know that.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.858
And I love you for that.
But I have to try.

19:26.861 --> 19:28.297
Please, Annabelle.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.609
Uh, don't worry,
that's totally normal.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.133
This is normal?

19:39.743 --> 19:41.441
It seems like
we're about to overheat.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.834
Just needs a little nap and...

19:43.878 --> 19:45.271
Maybe some coolant.

19:47.098 --> 19:50.450
There's a motel
two miles away from here.
We can stop there.

19:55.281 --> 19:58.588
Whoa. This place is dope.

20:01.112 --> 20:02.201
Anthony.

20:03.550 --> 20:04.464
Lourdes.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.163
Uh...

20:08.207 --> 20:09.556
How do you know our names?

20:10.861 --> 20:14.300
Uh, Naomi often talks
about her close friends.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.086
During boxing.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.957
What can I do for you?

20:20.001 --> 20:23.396
Uh, we wanted to ask you
about the Superman incident
at the square.

20:23.439 --> 20:27.443
That was months ago.
Why the sudden interest?

20:27.487 --> 20:33.188
Uh, well, I'm working
on a Superman story
for the high school newspaper.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.276
So...

20:34.320 --> 20:36.060
That's not a good idea.

20:36.104 --> 20:40.587
- Why not?
- Because I already confessed to planning the stunt.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.893
Right. We know that.
It's just...

20:42.937 --> 20:46.767
Some of the specifics
don't really add up.

20:47.942 --> 20:50.423
You said you did it
for publicity, right?

20:50.466 --> 20:52.947
To get people in the shop.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.253
That's right.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.602
It's not really working.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.784
The intent was more, um,

21:04.959 --> 21:06.787
artistic than commercial.

21:06.830 --> 21:09.703
That was around the time
Naomi started taking
boxing lessons, right?

21:09.746 --> 21:12.271
I have an appointment soon.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.404
I really should be
getting back to work.

21:15.448 --> 21:16.797
Who's Akira?

21:16.840 --> 21:18.494
How do you know that name?

21:21.932 --> 21:26.937
Um... She was
with Naomi at my store

21:26.981 --> 21:30.289
and I overheard her name.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.116
- Who is she?
- It doesn't concern you.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.729
What do you know
about the Superman incident
in the square?

21:35.772 --> 21:37.600
Nothing.

21:37.644 --> 21:40.603
Stop asking that
and don't come back here again.

21:59.753 --> 22:03.800
I'm so glad this place
is vintage charming
instead of <i>Bates Motel.</i>

22:03.844 --> 22:05.759
I put coolant in the car
and I called my mom

22:05.802 --> 22:07.543
and told her
I'm staying at your place.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.458
Teenage deception complete.

22:12.809 --> 22:15.377
Babe, are you listening
to a power ballad right now?

22:15.421 --> 22:17.031
That's definitely
not on our playlist.

22:21.688 --> 22:24.430
Do you ever wish you could
go back to the way
that things used to be?

22:24.473 --> 22:27.346
Before Superman,
before all of this?

22:29.652 --> 22:33.482
Well, first off,
anything pre Olivia Rodrigo
is a non-starter for me.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.266
That was a period
of true darkness.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.790
I'm being serious.

22:37.399 --> 22:38.487
I know.

22:39.706 --> 22:41.360
No, I don't wish that.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.013
Do you?

22:44.275 --> 22:46.016
Sometimes.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.062
Three months ago,
I was a normal teenager.

22:49.193 --> 22:50.543
And now so much has changed.

22:50.586 --> 22:55.678
With my parents,
with Nathan,
with everything.

22:55.722 --> 22:58.594
And it's not just for me,
it's for you, too.

22:58.638 --> 23:01.554
Yeah, I've had my fair share
of close calls, but...

23:02.729 --> 23:04.861
isn't it also kind of awesome?

23:04.905 --> 23:06.515
Almost dying?

23:06.559 --> 23:10.606
Okay, not that part,
but there's been
a lot of good stuff too.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.391
Would you have ever imagined

23:12.434 --> 23:14.697
that we would be friends
with a tattoo artist
who has wings,

23:14.741 --> 23:17.396
or find out that
scary used car salesman

23:17.439 --> 23:19.180
is actually
a pretty stand-up guy,

23:19.223 --> 23:23.053
or that your parents are aliens
or that you have superpowers.

23:23.097 --> 23:25.012
Three months ago,
you were Superman's fan.

23:25.055 --> 23:28.450
Now you're basically
Superman 2.0, babe.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.845
Superman is Superman.

23:31.888 --> 23:34.761
He's confident.
He's sure of himself.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.895
He's always known
that he should be a hero,

23:38.939 --> 23:40.462
that he <i>could</i> be a hero.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.464
We don't know that.

23:42.508 --> 23:45.641
Maybe his comics
are like Insta.

23:45.685 --> 23:47.643
Maybe they only show
the good parts.

23:47.687 --> 23:52.039
Maybe... Superman's
listening to sad girl music
in his Ice Castle too.

23:52.082 --> 23:53.606
You mean,
his Fortress of Solitude?

23:53.649 --> 23:55.651
Whatever, my point is,

23:56.957 --> 23:59.089
even if you're
not Superman yet,

24:00.395 --> 24:02.615
isn't the journey
kind of the point?

24:05.835 --> 24:08.534
Everyone is expecting
so much from me...

24:10.449 --> 24:11.928
and I've trained
as hard as I could,

24:11.972 --> 24:14.017
but what if
the adults are right?

24:17.673 --> 24:19.196
What if I'm not ready?

24:34.168 --> 24:35.822
Naomi, what's wrong?

24:35.865 --> 24:37.867
The man who chased me
when I was a baby?

24:37.911 --> 24:39.042
He's here.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.529
So, scary Red eyes,
the alien assassin
from your nightmare

24:47.573 --> 24:48.835
is here
in this motel right now.

24:48.878 --> 24:50.706
He was knocking on doors.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.447
I can't believe
I'm going to die in Oregon's
oldest motel room.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.449
I thought worst case scenario
I'd get dysentery.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.277
Why would you get dysentery?

24:56.320 --> 24:58.366
Like in the old video game,
with the horses
and the wagons?

24:58.409 --> 25:00.324
Okay, we're not going to die,
and we're not
gonna get dysentery.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.544
We just...
We just need a distraction
to get to the car.

25:02.588 --> 25:03.893
Like in <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

25:03.937 --> 25:05.155
When Jeff Goldblum
distracts the dinosaur

25:05.199 --> 25:06.722
so the kids
can get to the car.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.245
So we're Jeff Goldblum
or we're the kids.

25:08.289 --> 25:10.160
Wait. Are we the dinosaurs?

25:10.204 --> 25:11.901
I was thinking
more like Merry and Pippin
from <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

25:12.815 --> 25:14.164
They distracted the Orcs.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.644
Okay, we definitely
shouldn't have let

25:15.688 --> 25:17.254
Jacob talk us
into that movie marathon.

25:20.475 --> 25:21.781
Fire alarm. Classic.

25:21.824 --> 25:23.652
- Ready?
- Ready.

25:36.447 --> 25:37.361
Let's go.

25:45.239 --> 25:46.719
Where's the husband?

25:46.762 --> 25:48.111
At the base.

25:48.155 --> 25:50.244
We thought it was
best to act normal.

25:51.941 --> 25:53.290
How's the ethilium bonding?

25:54.465 --> 25:56.076
We're close.

25:56.119 --> 25:57.817
I just have to
complete one more scan,

25:57.860 --> 26:00.820
and then all that's left
is to reprogram the Nav.

26:05.128 --> 26:07.304
We never wanted this
for Naomi.

26:07.348 --> 26:09.742
Nobody wanted any of this.

26:09.785 --> 26:13.223
I hate taking her
from this place she loves.

26:13.267 --> 26:17.097
Sixteen years, and we've
asked ourselves every day
if we did the right thing.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.928
Were we really the best ones
to take care of Naomi?

26:24.191 --> 26:26.280
We love her
more than anything but...

26:27.760 --> 26:29.936
Would she have been
better off with Zumbado,

26:31.067 --> 26:31.981
or you?

26:33.766 --> 26:35.898
Someone with powers.

26:35.942 --> 26:38.771
Someone who could protect her
in a way that we couldn't?

26:42.122 --> 26:45.125
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we have been
holding her back.

26:51.131 --> 26:54.308
Do you remember
what it was like when
the Tear first happened?

26:55.962 --> 26:57.659
It was devastating.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.182
For all of us.

27:01.271 --> 27:02.403
I had my own pain.

27:04.797 --> 27:08.670
This event
that ruined our planet

27:08.714 --> 27:10.933
also gave me powers.

27:12.631 --> 27:16.635
I got stronger
while everyone else
around me suffered.

27:19.812 --> 27:22.162
And I have never
come to terms with that.

27:22.205 --> 27:24.904
You can't
blame yourself.

27:24.947 --> 27:27.776
It was a random accident. Chance.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.343
I believe it was destiny.

27:30.779 --> 27:32.172
For better or worse.

27:34.609 --> 27:38.265
But I had resigned myself
to the fate of our planet.

27:40.963 --> 27:43.009
And then I met Naomi.

27:44.837 --> 27:48.971
And for the first time,
in a very long time,

27:49.580 --> 27:51.191
I have hope.

27:53.367 --> 27:56.936
That's because you and Greg
raised an incredible daughter.

28:04.378 --> 28:05.684
Thank you.

28:11.951 --> 28:14.083
I know you said
the middle of nowhere,

28:14.127 --> 28:18.218
but, uh, this is like
the middle of nowhere.

28:24.093 --> 28:25.878
Why would it send us here?

28:26.879 --> 28:28.750
Did the space locket lie to us?

28:40.588 --> 28:41.763
I don't understand.

28:45.114 --> 28:47.377
So, what do we do now?

28:51.381 --> 28:54.515
So, obviously,
we weren't going to listen
to Dee and Zumbado,

28:54.558 --> 28:56.778
but what exactly
are we doing in the woods?

28:56.822 --> 29:01.261
So, my buddy said
that he saw a weird flash
in the Red River forest

29:01.304 --> 29:03.219
on the day
of the Superman thing.

29:04.917 --> 29:08.790
So what do we think
evidence of a Superman stunt
looks like?

29:09.922 --> 29:12.272
I'm not really sure.

29:12.315 --> 29:14.796
What? I thought you were,
like, the CEO of this forest.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.102
I don't know,
it could be anything.

29:16.145 --> 29:18.104
It could be
scorch marks on the trees,

29:18.147 --> 29:20.236
it could be discolored grass,

29:20.280 --> 29:22.848
anything that
looks out of place.

29:31.073 --> 29:32.945
What about a very weird rock?

29:45.131 --> 29:47.133
We've seen markings
like this before.

29:48.351 --> 29:49.309
At the mill.

30:04.106 --> 30:05.412
I think it's time to go.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.459
You shouldn't have
come out here.

30:22.472 --> 30:23.822
Get behind me.

30:33.222 --> 30:34.833
It's time for you to go.

30:40.055 --> 30:41.361
This isn't over.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.451
What the hell?

30:48.672 --> 30:49.586
Who are you?

30:55.723 --> 30:57.464
Do you see anything
that seems like it could be
an energy source?

30:57.507 --> 30:58.595
All I see is grass.

30:58.639 --> 31:00.989
Which technically
is an energy source

31:01.033 --> 31:03.165
for cows and other herbivores.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.865
Maybe
the space locket's broken.

31:06.908 --> 31:09.084
Annabelle, someone's coming.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.086
Oh, no.

31:11.782 --> 31:12.871
It's Red Eyes, isn't it?

31:16.570 --> 31:19.921
I've been searching for you
for a very long time.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.531
I won't let you hurt her.

31:21.575 --> 31:24.012
I'm not here for your friend.
She's inconsequential.

31:24.056 --> 31:25.318
Hey, that's very rude!

31:28.060 --> 31:29.844
I'm not leaving you.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.455
And I love you for that.
But this isn't your fight.
Please, go.

31:32.499 --> 31:33.674
Not this time.

31:38.113 --> 31:39.593
Well, then get behind me.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.379
I've seen you before.

31:43.423 --> 31:45.251
You came after me
when I was a baby.

31:45.294 --> 31:48.036
Interesting how life
comes full circle.

31:48.080 --> 31:51.257
In the end,
you always wind up
back at the beginning.

31:51.300 --> 31:56.958
Everyone else,
the bounty hunter, Mac,
Julian, came to take you home.

31:59.961 --> 32:02.964
But me,
I'm here to take you out.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.133
Naomi, no!

32:57.018 --> 32:58.498
Way above my pay grade.

33:09.378 --> 33:10.727
Babes, you're not bleeding!

33:11.641 --> 33:12.729
Are you invincible?

33:24.872 --> 33:26.700
I'm sure you have questions.

33:26.743 --> 33:28.484
What was that rock?

33:28.528 --> 33:31.139
Who was that guy,
and what the hell
is going on?

33:31.183 --> 33:33.098
Perhaps one question at a time.

33:33.141 --> 33:35.056
You have wings.

33:35.100 --> 33:38.059
What is this,
some kind of secret
military experiment?

33:38.103 --> 33:40.105
Are you soldiers?
Are you weapons?

33:40.148 --> 33:41.628
We're none of those things.

33:43.238 --> 33:44.761
The universe is vast.

33:45.849 --> 33:47.851
Much bigger than humans think.

33:47.895 --> 33:49.201
There are other planets,

33:49.853 --> 33:50.767
other dimensions.

33:53.118 --> 33:57.339
It really seems
like you're talking about
the multi-verse.

33:57.383 --> 34:00.255
Which is very weird because
that's a comic-book thing.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.215
It's not real.

34:04.129 --> 34:05.217
It is real.

34:07.567 --> 34:08.785
So is Superman.

34:08.829 --> 34:11.745
Superman, the guy
who flies around in a cape

34:11.788 --> 34:14.878
and is allergic
to kryptonite, that guy?

34:14.922 --> 34:16.271
You guys are messing with us.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.536
How were you able
to do those things?

34:20.580 --> 34:24.410
Throw that guy, use... wings?

34:27.413 --> 34:29.110
Because we aren't
from this planet.

34:31.591 --> 34:33.680
We must have died
in the woods back there.

34:33.723 --> 34:36.378
It's the only possible way
any of this could be
happening right now.

34:36.422 --> 34:38.119
We are dead, right?

34:39.251 --> 34:40.687
This is a lot to take in.

34:43.298 --> 34:45.126
It will take
some time to process.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.260
You can't tell anyone.

34:49.870 --> 34:52.438
You saved our lives. Why?

34:52.481 --> 34:55.876
Because you care about Naomi.

34:57.356 --> 34:59.097
And we care about her.

35:00.141 --> 35:02.274
So Naomi
knows about you two?

35:02.317 --> 35:04.624
Yes. For a few months now.

35:10.325 --> 35:12.284
Naomi's not
from this planet, is she?

35:14.242 --> 35:16.853
That is not our story to tell.

35:24.818 --> 35:28.909
I don't know about you,
but I'm ready
to go back to that motel.

35:31.346 --> 35:35.481
He said that in the end
you always go back
to the beginning.

35:36.830 --> 35:40.225
Okay, well, we're definitely
not taking life advice

35:40.268 --> 35:42.575
from a guy
whose day job is assassin.

35:48.320 --> 35:51.279
This... was the beginning.

36:09.906 --> 36:12.779
Uh, was that always there?

36:16.304 --> 36:18.176
I think we're
supposed to go through it.

36:23.485 --> 36:24.617
Are you coming?

36:26.662 --> 36:28.360
I think this one's
just for you.

36:29.535 --> 36:30.927
I'll be waiting right here.

37:20.412 --> 37:21.587
Naomi.

37:23.937 --> 37:25.417
We've been expecting you.

37:26.287 --> 37:27.462
Who are you?

37:28.594 --> 37:30.248
We're your parents.

37:39.996 --> 37:41.433
Who are you?

37:41.476 --> 37:43.348
We're your parents.

37:46.916 --> 37:47.830
Mom?

37:49.919 --> 37:51.747
Is that really you?

37:51.791 --> 37:54.968
It's the essence of me.
The essence of your father.

37:59.842 --> 38:03.455
I miss you so much,
even though
I never really knew you.

38:05.152 --> 38:06.936
I have so many questions.

38:08.764 --> 38:11.550
We'll answer them
as best we can.

38:13.116 --> 38:14.335
What happened to you?

38:14.379 --> 38:16.424
We don't know.

38:16.468 --> 38:20.167
But if you're watching this,
then it must have been
something catastrophic.

38:20.210 --> 38:21.603
Because of me?

38:21.647 --> 38:24.824
No. None of this
is because of you, Naomi.

38:24.867 --> 38:27.479
Why did you send me
to that Earth?

38:28.828 --> 38:31.787
Out of all of the planets
in the multi-verse?

38:31.831 --> 38:34.834
We believe it offered
a path to understanding

38:34.877 --> 38:36.575
what went wrong
on our planet.

38:37.358 --> 38:38.490
The power source.

38:42.668 --> 38:44.626
I couldn't find it.

38:44.670 --> 38:47.368
Because
there is no element.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.849
You are
the source of power, Naomi.

38:49.892 --> 38:53.983
That's why you
can save our world.

39:06.082 --> 39:07.475
I'm not here to fight.

39:08.041 --> 39:09.651
Just talk.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.958
There's nothing to talk about.

39:12.001 --> 39:14.526
- I know who you are.
- And I know who you are.

39:15.788 --> 39:20.183
A Thanagarian deserter
taking refuge on Earth.

39:20.227 --> 39:24.100
You must have been
very tired of war
to risk execution.

39:27.234 --> 39:29.845
Leave. Now.

39:29.889 --> 39:32.848
You can't be looking forward
to what's coming.

39:32.892 --> 39:35.373
Fighting another war
that isn't yours.

39:35.416 --> 39:36.591
I came here
to make you an offer.

39:36.635 --> 39:37.723
I'm not interested.

39:37.766 --> 39:39.377
Even if it involves Qyeala?

39:40.552 --> 39:42.249
Do not say her name.

39:42.292 --> 39:43.381
She's alive.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.123
You're lying.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.386
I can help you find her...

39:49.430 --> 39:50.910
if you do something for me.

39:55.915 --> 39:58.134
You can save our world.

40:02.748 --> 40:05.968
I'm just one person.
How can I save
an entire planet?

40:06.012 --> 40:09.450
You'll need the 29.
All of them.

40:12.105 --> 40:13.411
I don't feel ready.

40:14.803 --> 40:16.762
Heroes rarely do.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.504
What if I'm never ready?

40:19.547 --> 40:24.683
You need
to trust yourself,
your instinct, above all else.

40:24.726 --> 40:26.641
What are you talking about?

40:26.685 --> 40:31.341
Honey, the fact
that you're listening to us
and feeling us right now

40:31.385 --> 40:33.909
means that
someone has betrayed us.

40:33.953 --> 40:36.172
That's the only reason
we wouldn't be with you.

40:36.216 --> 40:39.262
As difficult as this
may be to accept, Naomi,

40:39.306 --> 40:41.134
you must remember this.

40:41.177 --> 40:42.657
Trust no one.
