Previously on "Get Shorty"...

00:09.010 --> 00:11.020
Marriage is a serious commitment.

00:11.040 --> 00:13.928
By the power vested in me
by the state of California,

00:14.000 --> 00:15.762
I pronounce you married.

00:15.794 --> 00:16.903
You may kiss your wife.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.150
Why not?

00:18.170 --> 00:20.917
Oh, shit.

00:20.981 --> 00:23.000
- What were you burning?
- Old photos.

00:23.020 --> 00:24.830
I'm making another movie.

00:24.885 --> 00:27.010
It needs to be privately financed.

00:27.030 --> 00:29.100
How close are you with L.A.?

00:29.131 --> 00:30.870
You want me to make an introduction.

00:31.301 --> 00:33.567
We believe and our boss believes

00:33.574 --> 00:35.271
you could be useful down the road.

00:35.319 --> 00:36.389
So, what are we talking about?

00:36.584 --> 00:39.484
- A wire.
- This button here

00:39.504 --> 00:40.674
is a recording device.

00:40.694 --> 00:42.554
Oh, okay.

00:42.574 --> 00:45.564
We're gonna need you to work
with Miles on that project.

00:45.584 --> 00:46.654
No. Don't call me, okay?

00:46.674 --> 00:48.584
Good luck with your case
and the next case!

00:48.604 --> 00:50.684
You should probably lower your voice.

00:50.704 --> 00:52.654
Did you go to work today?

00:52.674 --> 00:54.674
Yeah. Yeah, why?

00:54.694 --> 00:56.714
Gladys said you never showed.

00:57.494 --> 01:00.634
- I...
- Who was in the SUV?

01:00.654 --> 01:03.604
Who do they work for?

01:08.694 --> 01:10.594
You shot me?

01:31.554 --> 01:33.594
- Yeah?
- Are you alone?

01:33.614 --> 01:35.654
Suggestive way
to start the phone call, Lou.

01:35.674 --> 01:36.664
If I didn't know you better, I'd...

01:36.684 --> 01:38.644
I got to talk to you about something.

01:38.664 --> 01:41.714
How soon can you be
at Fairfax and Jefferson?

01:42.494 --> 01:43.704
- What, now?
- Yep.

01:44.061 --> 01:45.457
What's going on, man?

01:45.484 --> 01:46.664
It's better if I tell you in person.

01:46.684 --> 01:48.514
Well, that doesn't sound good.

01:48.534 --> 01:51.524
So, there's a pay lot.
It's on the southeast corner.

01:51.544 --> 01:52.544
It's by the locksmith.

01:52.564 --> 01:54.674
I'm at the top,
and I'm in the brown van.

01:54.694 --> 01:57.684
- Fairfax and...
- Jefferson.

01:57.704 --> 01:59.594
Lou, what the fuck is going on?

01:59.614 --> 02:01.634
I'll see you when you get here.

02:38.594 --> 02:41.574
What's the emergency then?
And why are you in the van?

02:43.604 --> 02:44.644
Holy shit.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.654
- Is that Rick?
- Yeah.

02:48.674 --> 02:51.664
Our friend here is working for the Feds.

02:53.574 --> 02:57.504
I saw him get in the car
with two agents.

02:57.524 --> 02:59.584
I grabbed him at his place.
He made a run for it.

02:59.604 --> 03:01.544
I put a slug in his shoulder.

03:01.564 --> 03:02.704
I threw him in the back.

03:03.484 --> 03:06.534
I cleaned up. I figured I should
get away from his house.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.574
Where you going? What the...

03:46.504 --> 03:47.624
Could you start again?

03:47.644 --> 03:50.624
Everything after
"Rick's working with the Feds."

03:50.644 --> 03:52.654
He was meeting with two agents
in a parking lot...

03:52.674 --> 03:55.514
Yeah, got that.

03:55.534 --> 03:56.654
I didn't find a wire on him.

03:56.674 --> 03:57.644
Lovely.

03:57.664 --> 04:01.614
So, now I'm wondering...

04:01.634 --> 04:03.624
- do we call Amara?
- You know, we knew

04:03.644 --> 04:06.634
that you were a spineless piece
of shite, but this? This?!

04:06.654 --> 04:08.494
Normally, we would call Amara,

04:08.514 --> 04:11.914
but since we introduced her to Rick...

04:12.090 --> 04:13.070
Come on.

04:13.077 --> 04:15.237
Maybe we don't mention it.

04:15.684 --> 04:17.504
Just, you know...

04:18.574 --> 04:20.584
...take care of it on our own.

04:25.504 --> 04:26.644
So we don't know
what he gave to the Feds?

04:26.664 --> 04:30.564
I didn't have time to question him.

04:30.584 --> 04:32.738
We got to take him somewhere.

04:34.484 --> 04:36.644
Th... There's a water-treatment facility

04:36.664 --> 04:38.664
that Ed used as a stash house.

04:38.684 --> 04:40.654
I think it's abandoned.

04:40.674 --> 04:42.584
Ed's not gonna walk in on us?

04:42.604 --> 04:43.644
I can't promise anything,

04:43.664 --> 04:47.544
but it's safer than capping Rick
on fucking Fairfax.

04:48.704 --> 04:51.484
What kind of bread was it?

04:51.504 --> 04:54.564
Wow! And you helped make it?

04:54.584 --> 04:57.484
Oh, you made it all by yourself.

04:57.504 --> 04:58.554
I see.

04:58.574 --> 05:00.484
Oh, was it delicious?

05:00.504 --> 05:01.584
We can get a sight line from there.

05:01.604 --> 05:02.604
We might.

05:02.624 --> 05:04.694
Because you have to eat dinner, silly.

05:04.714 --> 05:07.604
Broccoli is fun.

05:07.624 --> 05:08.694
It's... It's like little trees.

05:08.714 --> 05:10.694
Hey. Hey, kiddo, Gran-Gran's got to go,

05:10.714 --> 05:12.644
but I get to see you tomorrow, right?

05:12.664 --> 05:15.534
Okay, I love you. Bye-bye.

05:15.554 --> 05:17.494
You considering a microwave transmitter?

05:17.514 --> 05:18.624
Oh, nicely intuitive.

05:18.644 --> 05:20.494
We'd need a truck on the street.

05:20.514 --> 05:21.674
Or hardwire relay somewhere.

05:25.008 --> 05:26.554
Do you speak Arabic?

05:26.574 --> 05:28.614
Oh... sure.

05:30.514 --> 05:33.624
You know, last time, we had an
agent pose as an electrician.

05:33.644 --> 05:34.644
Which they figured out.

05:34.665 --> 05:36.712
- Not right away.
- Oh, another thing...

05:36.719 --> 05:38.584
If we could get eyes
on Rick Moreweather?

05:38.604 --> 05:40.644
He seems to have gone
off the reservation.

05:40.664 --> 05:41.664
What'd he do?

05:41.684 --> 05:43.534
If you would just check on him.

05:43.554 --> 05:45.504
Of course.

05:45.524 --> 05:48.484
And if you do decide
to pursue a transmitter,

05:48.504 --> 05:51.524
I'd check sight lines
from the residence, and we...

06:02.484 --> 06:04.544
- She's taking a nap?
- It's a micro nap.

06:04.564 --> 06:06.704
13 minutes, she can pull
a 20-hour shift without coffee.

06:07.484 --> 06:08.554
I'm trying to train my body to do it,

06:08.574 --> 06:11.664
but it's harder than you think.

06:36.484 --> 06:37.634
Okay, I'm gonna check the side entrance.

06:37.654 --> 06:39.594
It was open last time.

06:52.564 --> 06:53.644
I'm not gonna lie, Rick.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.534
I'm very disappointed.

06:58.564 --> 07:01.484
What's that?
You're gonna explain everything?

07:01.504 --> 07:03.504
Yeah?

07:03.524 --> 07:06.564
Oh, I'm sure you can.

07:06.584 --> 07:09.584
Oh!

07:09.604 --> 07:11.494
Okay, listen, can we talk about this?

07:11.514 --> 07:13.604
'Cause there's a lot of things
that I can clear up.

07:13.624 --> 07:15.514
I don't blame you for being upset.

07:15.534 --> 07:17.494
If I saw the same things
that you guys saw,

07:17.514 --> 07:19.494
I would draw the same conclusion.

07:19.514 --> 07:21.604
But I am not working with the Feds.

07:21.624 --> 07:22.674
Rick?

07:22.694 --> 07:25.704
Are those guys that you saw
FBI? Yes, they are.

07:26.484 --> 07:28.654
But that's the first time
that I talked to them.

07:28.674 --> 07:30.504
And I told them, I said,

07:30.524 --> 07:32.604
"I can't work with you.
There's nothing I can give you

07:32.624 --> 07:35.644
'cause I would never
give up my friends."

07:35.664 --> 07:37.644
So you talked about us.

07:37.664 --> 07:41.694
No. No, what I-I told them
was that I don't know anything,

07:41.714 --> 07:43.226
'cause I don't.

07:43.233 --> 07:44.654
Anything about what?

07:44.674 --> 07:47.574
Anything about anything.

07:47.594 --> 07:49.504
I should've never went to them
in the first place.

07:49.524 --> 07:52.714
Yes, I see that now.
But I was gonna tell you guys,

07:53.494 --> 07:56.544
and then you came over, and...
you were very aggressive.

07:56.564 --> 07:59.704
That whole Harpo Marx thing,
it... it made me nervous.

08:00.484 --> 08:03.514
It made...

08:07.634 --> 08:09.694
Why would you do that?

08:09.714 --> 08:13.534
It's not enough you fucking shot me?!

08:13.554 --> 08:18.614
You're thinking to yourself,
"What can I say to save myself?"

08:18.634 --> 08:20.574
And that's understandable.

08:20.594 --> 08:23.564
But we know more than you think we know,

08:23.584 --> 08:25.684
and if you lie to us, Rick...

08:28.574 --> 08:30.624
...despite it being unpleasant
for myself and Lulu here,

08:30.644 --> 08:31.664
we'll simply have no choice

08:31.684 --> 08:35.634
but to shoot you
in the fucking head this time.

08:35.654 --> 08:38.544
You with me?

08:38.563 --> 08:40.554
You understand?

08:43.544 --> 08:45.544
Uh-huh.

08:45.564 --> 08:49.684
Now, what exactly
do the Feds have on us?

08:52.684 --> 08:55.654
They want Amara.

08:55.674 --> 08:58.544
They think that she killed

08:58.564 --> 09:02.624
some of her ex-boyfriends
or business partners, I guess.

09:02.644 --> 09:06.664
But they never said that
either one of you were involved.

09:08.604 --> 09:12.554
How long have you been talking to them?

09:12.574 --> 09:14.674
They approached me, okay?

09:14.694 --> 09:18.217
All right? It was before
production started.

09:18.260 --> 09:19.460
Who's "they"?

09:20.494 --> 09:24.624
Uh, the main lady is
some Special Agent Dillard.

09:24.644 --> 09:28.614
Did Dillard ask anything
about "The Admiral's Mistress"?

09:32.514 --> 09:34.704
They had questions about the cash.

09:35.102 --> 09:36.282
What did you say?

09:39.714 --> 09:43.614
They know that we didn't put
Amara's cash on the books.

09:46.704 --> 09:49.554
Did you show them the books?

09:51.034 --> 09:53.054
- Yeah.
- And there it is.

09:53.405 --> 09:55.375
Money laundering, you...

09:55.395 --> 09:57.956
Fuck me!

10:03.535 --> 10:05.575
What else do they know?

10:06.355 --> 10:08.505
A little woozy here from you
squeezing my gunshot wound.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.425
- Rick!
- Listen,

10:10.445 --> 10:12.525
I'm sorry, but it's hard
to think straight

10:12.545 --> 10:15.455
when you're in agonizing pain.

10:15.475 --> 10:17.425
Maybe getting shot's
not a big thing for you guys,

10:17.445 --> 10:19.197
but this is the first time for me.

10:19.204 --> 10:21.505
Slug went in and out,
and I disinfected it.

10:21.525 --> 10:22.505
With Chardonnay.

10:22.525 --> 10:24.555
He poured Chardonnay on it!

10:24.575 --> 10:27.365
Whatever. Here.

10:27.385 --> 10:29.405
What's that?

10:29.425 --> 10:30.425
Hydrocodone.

10:30.445 --> 10:33.365
It's like, uh, Vicodin.

10:33.385 --> 10:34.445
You just carry those around with you?

10:34.465 --> 10:35.555
I have my own medical issues.

10:35.575 --> 10:38.445
Here, stick your tongue out.

10:38.465 --> 10:42.365
- Ah.
- Don't bite me.

10:42.385 --> 10:44.465
Are we ready?

10:44.485 --> 10:47.395
Rick, what else do the Feds know?

10:47.415 --> 10:50.385
And don't you dare
fucking say "nothing."

10:52.415 --> 10:55.509
They know about the driver
getting shot in Nevada.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.475
The set burning down.

10:58.495 --> 11:01.465
- The hillbillies in Big Bear.
- Hillbillies?

11:01.485 --> 11:04.385
The neighbors that were
at my father's summer place.

11:04.405 --> 11:06.415
You weren't there for that.

11:09.375 --> 11:11.455
Have you ever worn a wire?

11:13.565 --> 11:15.535
- I mean, yeah.
- You did?

11:15.555 --> 11:18.445
But nobody talks business
around me, nobody.

11:18.465 --> 11:22.385
Did you wear it
for specific conversations

11:22.405 --> 11:24.475
or every day?

11:24.495 --> 11:27.395
- Most days.
- Jesus Christ.

11:27.415 --> 11:29.435
Yeah, there's a recording device

11:29.455 --> 11:32.425
in one of these coat buttons.

11:32.445 --> 11:33.415
That coat?

11:33.435 --> 11:35.435
You're wearing a wire now?

11:35.455 --> 11:36.425
You said you checked!

11:36.452 --> 11:38.422
Why didn't you fucking tell me?!

11:38.435 --> 11:40.290
Oh, when, when? The five seconds between

11:40.345 --> 11:42.298
when you shot me
and put tape on my mouth?

11:42.355 --> 11:43.425
Which button?

11:43.445 --> 11:46.505
The top right pocket.

11:57.465 --> 11:59.545
Can they hear us now?

11:59.565 --> 12:02.415
Yes! Yes!

12:02.435 --> 12:04.565
The Feds are listening to us right now.

12:05.345 --> 12:08.415
So, if anything happens to me...

12:08.435 --> 12:10.575
Check him for a battery.

12:11.355 --> 12:13.455
I mean, the Feds, they're
probably moving in right now...

12:13.475 --> 12:15.575
Right now as we speak.

12:16.355 --> 12:17.535
So you, look, let me go.

12:17.555 --> 12:20.535
I'll put in a good word for you.

12:20.555 --> 12:23.575
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

12:24.355 --> 12:26.455
Which means there's no transmitter.

12:26.475 --> 12:28.395
Which means they need the coat
to get the data.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.375
No, no, no, no, no. They told me.

12:30.395 --> 12:32.355
They told me...

12:35.405 --> 12:36.555
You remember what we said earlier

12:36.575 --> 12:39.475
about us preferring the truth?

12:42.525 --> 12:45.385
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:45.405 --> 12:47.445
How long you been wearing this thing?

12:47.465 --> 12:49.375
I started to record on my phone,

12:49.395 --> 12:52.465
and... and that didn't work.

12:52.485 --> 12:56.425
So they gave me the...
The button a couple weeks ago.

12:56.445 --> 13:00.365
Were you wearing it when we
spoke about the next project,

13:00.385 --> 13:01.525
"Wylderness"?

13:03.495 --> 13:05.515
Fuck me!

13:08.345 --> 13:11.505
Feds wanted me to take on
a-a whole new investigation.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.555
Go after the cartel.

13:13.575 --> 13:16.465
And I said, "Count me out."

13:16.485 --> 13:17.505
Cartel?

13:17.525 --> 13:19.495
They said the word "cartel"?

13:19.515 --> 13:20.525
Yeah.

13:20.545 --> 13:23.707
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's not you.

13:24.535 --> 13:26.435
They never mentioned us

13:26.455 --> 13:29.365
in connection with drug trafficking?

13:29.385 --> 13:31.365
No. Why would they?

13:31.385 --> 13:34.445
Or homicide?

13:34.465 --> 13:36.555
You're not killers.

13:42.525 --> 13:45.425
So, it's just laundering.

13:45.445 --> 13:47.495
That's all they need to put us away.

13:47.515 --> 13:49.385
It's all they fucking need!

13:50.515 --> 13:54.535
Guys, guys, I'm sorry.

13:54.555 --> 13:57.365
It's a bad situation all around here.

13:57.385 --> 13:59.555
I know you're probably thinking,
"Is Rick gonna testify?"

13:59.575 --> 14:01.555
No, he's not.

14:01.575 --> 14:04.485
If I get on a plane tonight,

14:04.505 --> 14:06.455
I'm out of the country.

14:06.475 --> 14:08.475
Never see me again.

14:08.495 --> 14:11.455
Huh? Huh? You never see me again.

14:11.475 --> 14:12.865
Right? I just vanish.

14:13.055 --> 14:15.364
Yeah. You'll vanish, all right.

14:21.475 --> 14:23.415
Unknown number.

14:23.435 --> 14:26.525
Anyone looking for you, Rick?

14:26.545 --> 14:29.365
- Maybe.
- Who's that?

14:29.385 --> 14:31.455
Supposed to go to Amara's after.

14:33.425 --> 14:37.405
Don't say a fucking word.

14:37.425 --> 14:39.385
Hello?

14:39.405 --> 14:41.405
- Is this Miles?
- Who's this?

14:41.425 --> 14:44.345
Herb Clark, calling from
the Clark Photo Center.

14:44.365 --> 14:47.385
You called about a photo we
developed, e-mailed me a copy?

14:47.405 --> 14:51.465
Right. Yeah, thanks for calling me back.

14:51.485 --> 14:53.033
This a good time?

14:53.072 --> 14:54.455
Oh, it's a perfect time.

14:54.475 --> 14:55.545
I'm looking at the photo.

14:55.565 --> 14:58.355
I'm afraid I don't recall this one.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.535
I just thought because it's
an unusual photo, maybe you'd...

15:00.555 --> 15:03.565
Oh, we work with thousands
of studio photographers,

15:04.345 --> 15:06.455
and I'm hazy on the '90s generally,

15:06.475 --> 15:08.395
other than they were fun.

15:08.415 --> 15:10.565
Hey, anything printed on the back?

15:11.345 --> 15:13.495
Could you just hold on a minute, Herb?

15:19.435 --> 15:23.425
It's just, uh, the date
and the address of your store.

15:23.445 --> 15:25.565
I wish I could help.

15:26.078 --> 15:27.545
Well, thanks for trying.

15:27.565 --> 15:29.465
You bet.

15:31.485 --> 15:34.415
What's that?

15:34.435 --> 15:36.465
What's what, you rat fuck?

15:36.485 --> 15:38.485
Looks like Debra Schaffer's kids.

15:38.505 --> 15:41.385
- Miles, can we, uh...
- Hold on.

15:43.565 --> 15:45.485
Debra Schaffer the actress?

15:45.505 --> 15:47.455
- Yeah.
- Miles!

15:47.475 --> 15:49.375
Yeah.

15:59.365 --> 16:00.505
We got to decide what we're doing.

16:00.525 --> 16:02.545
Yeah.

16:02.565 --> 16:07.535
Do we tell Amara about Rick?

16:08.293 --> 16:09.590
I mean, we can't just set him free.

16:09.678 --> 16:12.638
- He's a Federal fucking witness.
- Agreed.

16:13.495 --> 16:15.111
Angry as I am,

16:15.355 --> 16:19.525
the thought of Peewee working
on him with his blowtorch...

16:19.545 --> 16:21.555
The guy from Tucson.

16:21.575 --> 16:24.445
Couple years ago, Amara's ex-boyfriend?

16:24.465 --> 16:25.465
The... The turquoise guy...

16:25.485 --> 16:27.385
Oh, God, that was horrible.

16:27.405 --> 16:30.495
- The fucking stink of it.
- But like I was saying before,

16:30.515 --> 16:35.495
Amara could blame us
for introducing her to Rick.

16:35.515 --> 16:37.425
Yeah.

16:40.575 --> 16:43.455
It's better we take care
of this ourselves.

16:43.475 --> 16:45.405
Let her think that he just disappeared.

16:45.425 --> 16:46.555
Went into the Witness
Protection Program.

16:46.575 --> 16:49.575
That's what she'll think.

16:49.895 --> 16:51.095
So...

16:54.465 --> 16:56.385
- Sooner we do it, the better.
- Yeah.

16:56.405 --> 16:58.515
I mean,

16:58.535 --> 17:01.445
somebody's probably looking for him...

17:01.465 --> 17:03.245
The Feds, Amara.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.365
Fucking rat.

17:04.385 --> 17:06.425
We got no choice.

17:08.435 --> 17:10.415
Anyone know that you were
with him today?

17:10.435 --> 17:11.565
No, I was careful.

17:11.877 --> 17:13.555
The f...

17:27.385 --> 17:29.525
- What? What's going on?
- Shh!

17:29.545 --> 17:31.365
You said this place was abandoned.

17:31.385 --> 17:32.495
I've only been here a night.

17:32.515 --> 17:34.465
That would've been useful information.

17:37.485 --> 17:40.102
There.

17:41.365 --> 17:44.355
If you make a noise, if you try
to get their attention

17:44.375 --> 17:45.415
- in any way...
- I get it, I get it.

17:45.435 --> 17:46.485
We're out in the open here.

17:46.505 --> 17:48.455
We could hide behind there.

17:48.475 --> 17:49.495
In there.

17:49.515 --> 17:51.495
What do we do about him?

17:51.515 --> 17:53.485
Have to carry him.

17:53.505 --> 17:54.465
Oh, I weigh...

17:54.485 --> 17:55.575
- No, no, I'm heavy.
- One, two.

17:56.355 --> 17:57.515
- I'm very heavy.
- One, two, three.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.391
Easy.

18:03.485 --> 18:06.445
Easy, guys. Easy. Easy.

18:06.465 --> 18:08.465
- Easy, guys. Come on.
- Shh, shh, shh.

18:08.485 --> 18:11.485
Careful. All right.

18:11.505 --> 18:13.395
Put him down.

18:14.485 --> 18:15.485
Water on the floor.

18:15.505 --> 18:18.445
Watch for any wires... Exposed wires.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.545
Oh, shit.

18:19.565 --> 18:21.475
Ohh.

18:21.495 --> 18:23.485
- Shh!
- Fuck all, this is creepy.

18:27.555 --> 18:29.355
Sounds like a forklift.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.575
Well, there's only three of them.

18:31.355 --> 18:33.148
Well, I hope they leave
before they see our van.

18:33.355 --> 18:34.525
Oh, shit. If they find us...

18:34.545 --> 18:35.555
We'll handle it.

18:35.575 --> 18:37.505
'Cause that's all we need...

18:37.525 --> 18:40.465
Three more bodies.

18:40.485 --> 18:43.375
Three more? What do you mean "more"?

18:48.445 --> 18:49.525
Here.

18:54.425 --> 18:57.565
Oh, it's a boiler room.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.425
Guys, I'm feeling
a little nauseous here.

19:00.445 --> 19:02.395
It's probably the painkillers.

19:02.415 --> 19:03.495
Hey, Rick.

19:03.515 --> 19:04.565
Rick.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.575
How did you know those were
Debra Schaffer's kids?

19:08.355 --> 19:10.261
What, the picture? I don't know.

19:10.355 --> 19:12.355
I don't know. I could be wrong.

19:12.375 --> 19:14.170
Debra had tigers,

19:14.194 --> 19:17.455
and she'd let her kids play with
them like they were house cats.

19:17.475 --> 19:20.425
It was in the magazines back in the day.

19:20.445 --> 19:24.395
The daughter, was her name Jinny?

19:24.415 --> 19:26.555
Oh, I don't know.

19:26.575 --> 19:29.365
How about, um...

19:29.385 --> 19:31.355
What's Jinny short for?

19:31.375 --> 19:34.355
- Virginia?
- How about Virginia?

19:34.375 --> 19:36.183
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that rings a bell.

19:36.345 --> 19:37.515
What are you talking about?

19:37.535 --> 19:38.545
The girl from the motel,

19:38.565 --> 19:42.365
I thought maybe that was
a photo of her as a kid.

19:42.385 --> 19:44.405
Did you hook up with her?

19:44.425 --> 19:45.435
No.

19:45.455 --> 19:47.365
But you want to?

19:47.385 --> 19:49.465
Maybe we can talk about this later.

19:58.415 --> 20:01.525
Rick says the Feds have got us
on laundering, which is bad.

20:01.545 --> 20:05.405
But if that's all they've got
on us, white-collar crime?

20:05.425 --> 20:08.395
I mean, we're looking
at two, maybe three years,

20:08.415 --> 20:10.375
and with good behavior,
we're out in one.

20:10.395 --> 20:11.385
Best-case scenario.

20:11.405 --> 20:12.385
Yeah, but worst-case scenario...

20:12.405 --> 20:14.455
- Let's not go there.
- Okay, well,

20:14.475 --> 20:19.172
then our only other option
would be to run for it.

20:19.188 --> 20:21.268
Ecuador...

20:21.495 --> 20:24.375
has no extradition treaty.

20:26.435 --> 20:30.445
Can we drive to Ecuador?
'Cause I don't have a passport.

20:30.465 --> 20:32.193
You haven't been out of the country?

20:32.208 --> 20:34.445
- When would I have done that?
- That's just sad.

20:34.465 --> 20:37.535
Look, not everybody's a world traveler.

20:37.555 --> 20:40.375
My uncle never left Nye County
until he was 60,

20:40.395 --> 20:41.964
and that's because he got bronchitis.

20:41.971 --> 20:44.415
Lulu, I can't go on the run.
I did it once years ago.

20:44.435 --> 20:46.385
I can't do it again.

20:46.405 --> 20:48.525
I can't leave Emma.

20:48.545 --> 20:53.385
I can't, either. Leave the wife and kid.

20:53.405 --> 20:55.004
That's not right.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.465
Wife?

20:56.485 --> 20:58.485
You know what I mean.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.535
Is that a figurative expression?

21:02.555 --> 21:04.485
Because it's not one I've heard before.

21:04.505 --> 21:08.445
- I mean, it... it's complicated.
- Hold on.

21:08.465 --> 21:10.425
You did propose.

21:10.445 --> 21:12.575
Did she say yes?

21:13.100 --> 21:15.355
- Not immediately.
- Oh, my God.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.455
It's supposed to be a secret, okay?

21:16.475 --> 21:18.355
- Jesus Christ.
- I'm not even supposed...

21:20.495 --> 21:22.525
What is that?

21:22.545 --> 21:25.425
I think they turned on the furnace.

21:29.139 --> 21:31.385
Ah, yeah, it's already hot.

21:31.405 --> 21:33.243
And when exactly did you get married?

21:33.266 --> 21:34.525
I just told you it's a secret.

21:34.545 --> 21:36.395
Huh? What?

21:36.415 --> 21:38.445
Rick won't say anything.

21:43.425 --> 21:47.139
Lulu and Gladys had a bit of
an onset romance back in Nevada.

21:47.355 --> 21:49.115
Gladys? Whoa, whoa, my Gladys?

21:49.155 --> 21:50.515
No. Come on.

21:50.535 --> 21:52.415
Oh, and he knocked her up.

21:52.435 --> 21:54.334
- Jesus!
- No.

21:54.342 --> 21:57.395
And it turns out now they only
went and got fucking married.

21:57.415 --> 21:59.238
Oh, no, you're just
screwing with me now.

21:59.286 --> 22:01.485
- G-Gladys would've told me this.
- It's just a trial run.

22:01.505 --> 22:03.345
I mean, we're not married married.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.485
Oh, I see. I didn't realize
there were degrees of matrimony.

22:06.505 --> 22:07.790
You got her pregnant?!

22:09.415 --> 22:10.425
Shh.

22:10.445 --> 22:11.455
Hold on.

22:11.475 --> 22:13.375
Get the door.

22:17.565 --> 22:20.395
- This one?
- That's it.

22:20.415 --> 22:21.545
- Where is it?
- Right here.

22:21.565 --> 22:23.890
Not a fucking sound.

22:23.962 --> 22:25.058
I think it's through this one.

22:25.065 --> 22:26.535
Yeah, it's on the other side of...

22:26.555 --> 22:29.211
Yeah, we should check, but, uh...

22:29.348 --> 22:32.108
Okay, let me take a look.

22:32.425 --> 22:34.565
And would you to call forensics
back and push for an ETA?

22:35.345 --> 22:38.365
Then check traffic cams,
LADOT, and Caltrans.

22:38.385 --> 22:39.865
Thanks, love. Anything on Rick?

22:39.913 --> 22:42.485
Not at his place or his office.
Is everything all right?

22:42.505 --> 22:43.495
We checked the tracker on Rick's car.

22:43.515 --> 22:46.365
Found it parked 4 blocks from his house,

22:46.385 --> 22:47.405
driver's side window shot out.

22:47.425 --> 22:49.455
Someone pulled a slug from the backrest.

22:49.475 --> 22:50.435
Bloodstain on the seat.

22:50.455 --> 22:51.515
- Rick's blood?
- We're checking.

22:51.535 --> 22:54.415
And would you gather
surveillance on Rick's house,

22:54.435 --> 22:57.355
Amara's house, and the parking garage?

22:57.375 --> 22:58.435
The... The garage?

22:58.455 --> 23:01.415
Where we met with him
right before he went missing?

23:01.435 --> 23:03.535
Got it, yes.

23:03.555 --> 23:08.465
Uh... was I supposed to check
the tracker on his car?

23:08.485 --> 23:12.415
Next time, that would be great.

23:12.435 --> 23:14.505
Guess Amara's single again.

23:21.535 --> 23:24.455
When we first saw Rick,
he was frightened.

23:24.475 --> 23:26.435
I told him we would use
all our resources

23:26.455 --> 23:29.525
to make sure he wouldn't get hurt.

23:29.545 --> 23:32.405
I'm sorry.

23:32.425 --> 23:33.395
It's just graveyard humor.

23:33.415 --> 23:35.465
Would you check that surveillance?

23:39.375 --> 23:40.545
Can I see that transcript again?

23:40.565 --> 23:44.375
I appreciate that. Thank you.

23:53.415 --> 23:54.535
I think we're good.

23:57.445 --> 24:01.455
Is it just me, or did it get
really fucking hot?

24:01.475 --> 24:02.495
It's the furnace.

24:02.515 --> 24:04.415
I'm sweating.

24:04.435 --> 24:08.545
Yeah, I'd take my jacket off,
but I'm zip-tied to a chair.

24:08.565 --> 24:11.505
Your comfort is not our utmost concern.

24:14.435 --> 24:17.465
Does Gladys know
this part of what you do?

24:17.485 --> 24:19.405
Not currently.

24:19.425 --> 24:20.575
What does that mean?

24:21.079 --> 24:23.475
Nothing, it's just...

24:23.495 --> 24:25.435
lying to your wife is frowned upon

24:25.455 --> 24:27.365
by the Church of Latter-Day Saints.

24:27.385 --> 24:29.365
- I'm not saying it's realistic.
- Take it from me, man.

24:29.385 --> 24:32.555
Honesty is not the foundation
of a healthy relationship.

24:32.575 --> 24:34.395
That's a bit cynical.

24:34.415 --> 24:37.475
Says a man who's spying
on his girlfriend for the FBI.

24:37.495 --> 24:39.295
Well, I guess if I'm going to prison,

24:39.345 --> 24:41.455
she's gonna find out sooner or later.

24:41.475 --> 24:44.345
I just hope she keeps the kid.

24:47.495 --> 24:48.515
I don't know if you guys remember.

24:48.535 --> 24:50.525
But I, uh... I got kids,

24:50.545 --> 24:52.555
Kevin and Marci.

24:52.575 --> 24:55.355
Yeah, if anything happened to me,

24:55.375 --> 24:58.345
it'd be hard on them.

24:58.365 --> 24:59.475
Never seen you with your kids, Rick.

24:59.495 --> 25:02.385
Or heard you talk about them.

25:02.405 --> 25:05.575
Well, we're not as close
as I want to be.

25:06.355 --> 25:07.565
That makes it even harder...

25:08.345 --> 25:09.485
Losing your father before you have time

25:09.505 --> 25:11.445
to patch things up with him.

25:11.465 --> 25:14.405
Oh, it's getting hard to breathe.

25:14.425 --> 25:16.485
Yeah, me, too. Could we crack
the door open, guys, huh?

25:16.505 --> 25:18.455
- Could we... Just a little?
- Shh.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.545
I'm gonna pass out here.

25:19.565 --> 25:23.009
Well, do it quietly.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.515
Hey.

25:24.535 --> 25:27.575
When, uh... When you were...

25:28.355 --> 25:32.535
talking about being on the run before,

25:32.555 --> 25:34.545
you mean from Ireland?

25:34.565 --> 25:36.345
What about it?

25:36.365 --> 25:38.485
You just, you know,
never told me before.

25:38.505 --> 25:40.425
- I...
- No.

25:40.445 --> 25:42.575
I was young
and thought I was pretty tough.

25:43.355 --> 25:44.979
Made a mess of things,
and I had to leave.

25:45.355 --> 25:46.495
I could go back now,

25:46.515 --> 25:50.465
but nobody'd be too happy to see me.

25:50.485 --> 25:53.575
- Yago.
- Yago?

25:53.942 --> 25:55.082
No.

25:55.515 --> 25:58.535
- What?
- Shit.

25:58.555 --> 26:01.355
L.A. said they'd put
the money up for the movie.

26:01.375 --> 26:03.535
You went to L.A. for that?
I begged you not to.

26:03.555 --> 26:06.370
It doesn't matter now, does it?

26:07.455 --> 26:09.355
Guess not.

26:11.355 --> 26:13.535
This was it, man. This was the one.

26:13.555 --> 26:16.415
Now it's not even a movie.
It's a sting operation

26:16.435 --> 26:17.525
thanks to this cunt.

26:17.545 --> 26:20.575
- It's so hot, man.
- Shut your yap.

26:21.355 --> 26:22.415
Yeah, okay, you're over there.

26:22.435 --> 26:25.425
- I'm 5 feet from this boiler.
- And if you don't shut up,

26:25.445 --> 26:27.593
I will tie you to the boiler face first.

26:27.600 --> 26:28.525
Easy.

26:28.545 --> 26:31.485
What's with you, man?

26:31.505 --> 26:33.455
$30 million in financing

26:33.475 --> 26:35.535
and a brilliant fucking book,
but what would you know

26:35.555 --> 26:37.200
- about that?
- Keep it down.

26:37.355 --> 26:39.495
'Cause you make movies
about giant squid.

26:39.515 --> 26:42.365
- Okay.
- Alien fucking spiders.

26:42.385 --> 26:44.375
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?

26:44.395 --> 26:46.375
You think I would have worked
on "Admiral's Mistress"

26:46.395 --> 26:47.515
if I knew what I was getting into?

26:47.535 --> 26:49.405
You're why I'm mixed up in all this,

26:49.425 --> 26:51.475
why the Feds are after me.
It's your fucking fault!

26:51.495 --> 26:53.465
Quiet!

27:00.465 --> 27:02.365
No forklift.

27:02.385 --> 27:04.375
No voices.

27:04.395 --> 27:05.485
- Let's check.
- I'll turn off the lights.

27:05.505 --> 27:07.465
You get the door.

27:11.535 --> 27:14.435
Oh, that breeze.

27:14.455 --> 27:16.385
- No lights on out here.
- All right, let's look.

27:16.405 --> 27:19.475
Guys, don't leave me in here, guys.

27:19.495 --> 27:21.345
Hey. No, no, no.

27:21.365 --> 27:23.365
Guys.

27:35.505 --> 27:37.525
They're gone.

27:37.545 --> 27:38.575
Let's get Rick.

27:38.855 --> 27:40.203
Wait.

27:41.555 --> 27:44.475
We got to get this over with.

27:44.495 --> 27:46.495
Who's gonna do it?

27:49.505 --> 27:51.485
Odds or evens?

27:51.505 --> 27:54.445
Odds.

27:54.465 --> 27:57.455
Once, twice, thrice.

27:57.475 --> 27:59.535
Fuck!

28:02.345 --> 28:04.599
Not in the boiler room.

28:05.455 --> 28:09.365
There's a drain right here.

28:09.385 --> 28:11.445
Grab the stuff.

28:26.385 --> 28:27.575
Oh, fresh air.

28:28.355 --> 28:30.525
Whew! It's... It's bad in there.

28:30.545 --> 28:33.475
Like the surface of the sun.

28:33.495 --> 28:36.455
What's with the tarp here, huh?

28:36.475 --> 28:38.465
Oh. Hold on, hold on.
No, no, no. No, no.

28:38.485 --> 28:40.515
Hold on, hold on. No. No! Not like this!

28:40.535 --> 28:42.997
Please, not a bullet! No!

28:43.037 --> 28:45.535
I want the Hemlock Society
method, please.

28:45.555 --> 28:47.455
- Not a bullet!
- Wait.

28:47.475 --> 28:49.465
- What?
- What's the Hemlock Society?

28:49.485 --> 28:51.385
- Don't draw this out.
- No, no, I saw it.

28:51.405 --> 28:52.395
I saw it on "60 Minutes."

28:52.415 --> 28:54.138
It's the easiest way to kill yourself.

28:54.355 --> 28:56.355
Just... Just pills and a plastic bag.

28:56.375 --> 28:57.425
We have neither of those.

28:57.445 --> 28:59.465
I got pills.

28:59.485 --> 29:01.465
- You fucking kidding me?
- Guys, come on, come on.

29:01.485 --> 29:02.505
All that we've been through?

29:02.525 --> 29:05.250
Let me just...
Let me choose how I do this.

29:05.345 --> 29:07.515
I mean, why not?
If that's what he wants...

29:10.515 --> 29:13.425
It's... It's... It's online.
There's instructions.

29:13.445 --> 29:15.505
Please don't Google that.

29:15.525 --> 29:17.445
It's all right. It's a burner.

29:17.465 --> 29:21.405
The browsers take forever
on those things.

29:21.425 --> 29:23.455
Okay, is it hemlock like the plant?

29:23.475 --> 29:26.425
Exactly, yeah. Yeah, I saw it on TV.

29:26.445 --> 29:27.535
And I-I just thought

29:27.555 --> 29:29.535
if I got to go,
that's the way I want to do it.

29:29.555 --> 29:31.415
Oh, okay, here it is. I got it.

29:31.435 --> 29:35.455
"Just make sure you leave room
in the plastic bag

29:35.475 --> 29:37.355
to keep away from your face.

29:37.375 --> 29:40.345
The goal is slowly passing away

29:40.365 --> 29:42.455
from carbon dioxide poisoning,

29:42.475 --> 29:43.555
creating a sleepy,

29:43.575 --> 29:45.545
- lightheaded feeling...
- What the...

29:45.565 --> 29:47.485
...that gives way to unconsciousness.

29:47.505 --> 29:52.385
If the pills fail
to cause terminal overdose,

29:52.405 --> 29:54.355
the plastic bag ensures

29:54.375 --> 29:56.555
that you don't survive
in a damaged state."

29:56.575 --> 29:58.555
Mm, yeah, I can see
why you'd prefer that.

29:58.575 --> 30:01.575
That sounds lovely.

30:02.355 --> 30:04.485
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking my pills.

30:06.435 --> 30:08.415
Rick, you don't want to die

30:08.435 --> 30:10.355
with a fucking bag over your head.

30:10.375 --> 30:13.485
I don't want to die at all,
but if I got to go,

30:13.505 --> 30:15.485
yeah, yeah, I choose the bag.

30:15.505 --> 30:18.475
Okay, it... it says
it takes 15 to 30 minutes

30:18.495 --> 30:22.345
depending on weight,
and I got... I got six pills.

30:22.365 --> 30:24.435
- Yeah, but I already took two.
- Yeah, so that...

30:24.455 --> 30:26.465
That makes two, so that's...

30:26.485 --> 30:29.415
That's eight, so that's four
times the prescribed dos...

30:29.435 --> 30:31.495
- That ought to do it.
- Okay.

30:31.515 --> 30:33.575
I can't take them dry.

30:34.125 --> 30:35.215
All right, sure.

30:35.465 --> 30:37.395
Just give them to him.

30:37.415 --> 30:38.525
I got to go find a plastic bag.

30:38.545 --> 30:42.415
There's got to be one
somewhere around here.

30:42.435 --> 30:44.535
This is insane. Okay.

30:44.555 --> 30:45.565
Let's...

30:47.894 --> 30:50.150
Open up.

30:53.435 --> 30:54.495
Swallow.

30:54.515 --> 30:56.565
Got to chew them.

31:03.475 --> 31:05.525
Can't believe this is really happening.

31:05.545 --> 31:07.465
Yeah.

31:10.415 --> 31:12.505
If Gladys had left that
"Admiral's Mistress" script

31:12.525 --> 31:16.365
in the fucking trash...

31:16.385 --> 31:19.555
I'd be doing "Mace of Spades 2"
right now.

31:19.575 --> 31:21.445
Be going home,

31:21.465 --> 31:24.094
watching TV in my slippers.

31:24.118 --> 31:25.555
All right, here's another one.

31:36.415 --> 31:40.485
My first wife, she wanted me
to go to Minneapolis,

31:40.505 --> 31:43.415
get a job being a doctor.

31:43.435 --> 31:46.465
Imagine that? I almost did it.

31:46.485 --> 31:50.445
I almost fucking did it.
But no, I had to...

31:50.465 --> 31:53.415
Had to get all hung up on trying
to prove to my dad

31:53.435 --> 31:56.455
that I could make it
in the film business.

32:02.445 --> 32:06.385
You ever been to Minneapolis?

32:06.405 --> 32:07.555
- No.
- It's really nice.

32:07.575 --> 32:10.525
This time of year, it's really nice.

32:26.525 --> 32:29.515
What happens, huh? I just disappear now?

32:29.535 --> 32:33.395
My kids are gonna think
that I-I gave up on them.

32:35.435 --> 32:40.465
My dad won't even notice
until PGE shuts off his power.

32:40.485 --> 32:42.485
Serves him right.

32:44.455 --> 32:46.425
Last two.

32:48.535 --> 32:51.505
Yeah. Water.

32:56.565 --> 33:00.545
My kingdom for a glass of water.

33:02.385 --> 33:03.435
Is that a hacksaw?

33:03.455 --> 33:04.525
Hey! No, no, no, guys!

33:04.545 --> 33:07.365
No! Guys, I'm claustrophobic!

33:07.385 --> 33:09.445
Take it off! No! No!

33:09.465 --> 33:10.535
Listen, listen! When I found out

33:10.555 --> 33:14.425
the Feds were going after
you two guys, I was very upset!

33:14.445 --> 33:16.114
You know, we approach things
differently,

33:16.138 --> 33:18.345
but you have to admit,
we're a great team!

33:18.365 --> 33:21.395
Just relax, buddy.

33:21.415 --> 33:24.415
There's nothing I can say
that can change this?

33:24.435 --> 33:26.425
I'm afraid not.

33:29.425 --> 33:31.773
Okay. Okay.

33:35.365 --> 33:37.565
Then I got a favor to ask you.

33:37.860 --> 33:39.890
What's that?

33:40.395 --> 33:42.565
When Amara finds out
that I went to the Feds,

33:43.115 --> 33:45.335
she's gonna think everything was a lie.

33:47.525 --> 33:50.415
Like how much I care about her.

33:52.156 --> 33:54.505
But I wasn't lying about that.

33:54.525 --> 33:57.345
We'll tell her.

33:57.365 --> 34:00.555
I mean, she's... She's a sociopath.

34:00.575 --> 34:03.545
But if you put that aside,

34:04.535 --> 34:07.375
she's a special person.

34:09.505 --> 34:11.416
Oh.

34:12.058 --> 34:14.178
Oh, painkillers.

34:14.514 --> 34:20.344
I haven't been this high
since I had my wisdom teeth out.

34:41.574 --> 34:43.525
Plastic fucking bag?

34:43.545 --> 34:45.355
Just making him suffer.

34:45.375 --> 34:48.505
Usually I would say no, but...

34:48.525 --> 34:50.445
it's Rick.

34:50.465 --> 34:53.213
His last request.

34:54.435 --> 34:57.405
How long you say it takes?

34:57.425 --> 34:59.545
15 to 30 minutes.

35:06.555 --> 35:10.475
Gladys is gonna lose her healthcare.

35:10.495 --> 35:14.535
- What?
- Rick is her employer.

35:14.555 --> 35:17.874
When you change jobs,
the insurance carries over.

35:17.890 --> 35:20.435
Does it?

35:20.455 --> 35:21.465
Pretty sure.

35:34.375 --> 35:35.445
- Hi.
- Hey.

35:35.465 --> 35:38.475
So, they're signing up parents
to host post-game dinners.

35:38.495 --> 35:39.495
Are they?

35:39.515 --> 35:41.415
Yeah, every Tuesdays and Thursdays,

35:41.435 --> 35:43.355
and I can't work around Mom's schedule,

35:43.375 --> 35:45.435
so are you okay with hosting one?

35:45.455 --> 35:47.375
The team comes over, eats pizza.

35:47.395 --> 35:48.545
Super easy, that's it.

35:48.565 --> 35:51.395
- Why not?
- Really?

35:51.415 --> 35:52.505
That's great, Dad.

35:52.525 --> 35:54.555
How about Thursday the 17th?

35:54.575 --> 35:57.475
I-I don't have my day planner
on me right now,

35:57.495 --> 35:59.375
but I-I'm sure that's fine.

35:59.395 --> 36:01.084
It'll be super fun.

36:01.092 --> 36:02.435
I believe you.

36:02.455 --> 36:03.515
Thank you, okay?

36:03.535 --> 36:05.475
I got to go. I love you.

36:05.495 --> 36:07.475
Love you, too, Shorty.

36:15.435 --> 36:18.385
How much you think
you get paid to work here?

36:20.435 --> 36:23.525
I had a cousin who did
eight years at a sewage plant.

36:23.545 --> 36:26.555
Now, that is a tough gig.

36:28.555 --> 36:30.515
Can you tell if he's breathing?

36:30.535 --> 36:33.565
He's not moving.

36:34.011 --> 36:37.081
Well, guess it hasn't been 15 minutes.

36:44.144 --> 36:45.314
You okay?

36:47.505 --> 36:48.999
I've been fighting with Katie

36:49.006 --> 36:52.515
over how much time
I get to spend with Emma.

36:52.535 --> 36:54.365
Been telling her

36:54.385 --> 36:57.575
she needs her father, you know?

36:57.950 --> 37:00.130
Now I get to call her and say,

37:00.555 --> 37:03.555
"Turns out I'm gonna be in
prison until Emma's in her 40s,

37:03.575 --> 37:05.908
- so don't worry about it."
- No, no, no,

37:05.915 --> 37:08.267
- don't... don't talk like that.
- Worst-case scenario...

37:08.345 --> 37:10.535
- Stop.
- ...they hit us with RICO

37:10.555 --> 37:13.345
or homicide, or someone flips.

37:13.365 --> 37:15.405
Rick said they got us
on laundering charges.

37:15.425 --> 37:18.455
- That's it.
- And if he's wrong?

37:18.475 --> 37:20.545
We've already talked about this.

37:20.565 --> 37:23.355
We either do the time,

37:23.375 --> 37:25.575
or we run.

37:25.799 --> 37:27.859
Those are our choices.

37:28.435 --> 37:31.375
Just hold on. I'm gonna go check on him.

37:34.395 --> 37:38.515
The Feds aren't after us.

37:38.535 --> 37:40.425
They're after Amara.

37:40.445 --> 37:41.535
They're after La Capotillo,

37:41.555 --> 37:43.505
and they're hoping
to use my film project

37:43.525 --> 37:46.395
to make those arrests.

37:46.415 --> 37:49.505
So, really, we do have leverage.

37:49.525 --> 37:51.505
Only we're not working for the Feds.

37:51.525 --> 37:54.435
I'm not suggesting we do.

37:54.455 --> 37:56.415
Not exactly.

37:56.435 --> 37:57.535
Okay?

37:59.515 --> 38:01.345
What if we just stay out of their way

38:01.365 --> 38:03.365
while they build their case?

38:03.385 --> 38:04.525
Tell them that we're not gonna
blow the whistle.

38:04.545 --> 38:07.345
Buddy...

38:07.365 --> 38:08.525
I know things are tough,

38:08.545 --> 38:10.465
but we got to keep it together, okay?

38:10.485 --> 38:13.495
You see Rick there
with a bag on his head?

38:13.515 --> 38:16.385
That's what happens
when you work for the FBI.

38:16.405 --> 38:18.475
You're either dead
or you're in Witness Protection,

38:18.495 --> 38:19.535
which is worse.

38:19.555 --> 38:23.331
You think Emma and Katie
are gonna come live with you

38:23.338 --> 38:27.375
in Nebraska while you work
as a park ranger?

38:27.395 --> 38:28.435
No.

38:28.455 --> 38:29.996
Exactly.

38:31.405 --> 38:33.375
Had me worried there for a minute.

38:33.395 --> 38:35.505
I mean, I get it. I mean, this
is... this is happening fast.

38:35.525 --> 38:38.535
- It's...
- What if we tell the FBI

38:38.555 --> 38:41.435
to arrest us along with everyone else,

38:41.455 --> 38:46.465
and then down the road, they can
release us on a technicality?

38:46.485 --> 38:49.435
You called Rick a spineless shite.

38:49.455 --> 38:51.465
- How's that different?
- I told you, I...

38:51.485 --> 38:53.505
We're not going to give them anything

38:53.525 --> 38:56.455
- that they don't already have.
- I'm done talking about this.

38:56.475 --> 38:59.405
- No one will know.
- Don't.

38:59.425 --> 39:01.375
We'll demand full immunity.

39:01.395 --> 39:03.445
We won't have to testify,
and we'll make the film.

39:03.465 --> 39:06.485
I can't be a fucking rat!

39:08.405 --> 39:10.445
Even if it is
just looking the other way,

39:10.465 --> 39:12.290
I can't do it.

39:13.465 --> 39:17.545
Which means you can't do it either, see?

39:22.465 --> 39:24.375
What are you doing?
Stay away from that bag.

39:24.395 --> 39:27.445
I fucking mean it!

39:27.465 --> 39:29.391
No fucking way.

39:30.495 --> 39:33.475
I can see him breathing.

39:33.495 --> 39:35.525
And I'm gonna make a deal.

39:35.545 --> 39:38.535
So if I were you, I'd make sure
he's still breathing

39:38.555 --> 39:41.345
when the Feds come.

39:47.475 --> 39:49.525
You're not going anywhere.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.321
You gonna shoot me, Lulu?

39:57.355 --> 39:58.525
No, I'm gonna shoot him,
and you can explain that

39:58.545 --> 40:02.435
to the Feds, 'cause we're
in this together, pal.

40:05.555 --> 40:09.425
I'll do it.

40:09.445 --> 40:11.485
That's on you, then.

40:23.415 --> 40:24.545
Buddy...

40:24.565 --> 40:27.435
...you take one more step...

40:41.445 --> 40:43.385
This guy entered
the parking structure on foot

40:43.405 --> 40:45.485
four minutes before Rick drove in,

40:45.505 --> 40:47.375
left two minutes after he exited.

40:47.395 --> 40:49.415
- We have an angle on his face?
- No.

40:49.435 --> 40:51.385
- Okay.
- But this one's interesting.

40:51.405 --> 40:55.425
This 2008 Dodge Avenger drove in
three cars behind Rick,

40:55.445 --> 40:57.265
left one minute after he exited.

40:57.355 --> 40:59.515
- Plates?
- California. We're running it.

40:59.535 --> 41:01.515
A Subaru Outback...

41:01.535 --> 41:04.415
Go back to the guy in the hoodie.

41:04.435 --> 41:06.355
What's that by his leg?

41:06.375 --> 41:08.345
- A railing?
- No, he's holding onto it.

41:08.365 --> 41:09.525
It's a cane.

41:09.545 --> 41:10.565
A cane.

41:11.345 --> 41:13.435
Oh, would you get that?

41:13.455 --> 41:14.555
It could be a cane, yeah.

41:14.575 --> 41:17.525
Yeah, it's definitely a cane
if you look down there. May I?

41:17.545 --> 41:18.555
- Yes?
- Do you mind?

41:18.575 --> 41:20.355
- No.
- Okay.

41:20.375 --> 41:21.395
- Uh-huh.
- If we follow...

41:21.415 --> 41:24.555
Miles Daly asking to see you.

41:24.575 --> 41:27.505
- Asking for me?
- Yes.

41:27.525 --> 41:31.555
- By name?
- That's interesting.

41:31.575 --> 41:34.395
Okay. I'll take it in here.

41:34.415 --> 41:35.465
No.

41:35.485 --> 41:39.475
I mean, he's here, in the lobby.

41:42.565 --> 41:44.385
Hey, there.

41:44.405 --> 41:46.475
Afternoon.

41:46.495 --> 41:49.525
Tell me your name again?

41:49.545 --> 41:51.525
You know my name.

41:51.545 --> 41:53.565
Just, if you could spell it.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.545
You know how to spell it.

41:55.565 --> 41:57.505
What can I do for you?

41:57.525 --> 42:01.425
I asked to see a female
special agent named Dillard.

42:01.445 --> 42:04.425
- Dillard with a "D"?
- If every time I say something,

42:04.445 --> 42:06.445
you pretend that you don't know
how to spell it,

42:06.465 --> 42:10.395
it's really gonna slow us down.

42:10.415 --> 42:12.405
What's this regarding?

42:12.425 --> 42:14.465
Your investigation of Amara De Escalones

42:14.485 --> 42:16.475
and the Capotillo cartel.

42:16.495 --> 42:20.425
You're using my next film
project to bring them down,

42:20.445 --> 42:22.485
and...

42:22.505 --> 42:26.495
I'm okay with that, as long
as you can meet my terms.

42:26.515 --> 42:28.455
I'm not aware of any investigation.

42:28.475 --> 42:30.415
- Is she in there?
- Who?

42:30.435 --> 42:32.445
Agent Dillard.

42:34.515 --> 42:36.415
Here's what I need.

42:36.435 --> 42:39.471
Full immunity, in writing...

42:40.435 --> 42:42.455
for myself and Louis Darnell.

42:42.475 --> 42:44.445
Of course, you'll have to arrest
us with everybody else

42:44.465 --> 42:48.375
and then cut us loose
without having to testify.

42:48.395 --> 42:49.495
That's important.

42:49.515 --> 42:52.375
My next movie, "Wylderness,"

42:52.395 --> 42:56.415
we finish filming that
before you guys move in.

42:56.435 --> 42:57.455
How's that sound?

42:57.475 --> 42:59.375
Um, so, first, as... as I said,

42:59.395 --> 43:00.525
I'm not aware of any investigation...

43:00.545 --> 43:02.455
Can I speak with Agent Dillard, please?

43:02.475 --> 43:04.485
Just... Just wait.
Um, so, what makes you think

43:04.505 --> 43:05.505
that the individuals you mentioned

43:05.525 --> 43:09.415
are under investigation?
Why is that? Uh...

43:10.465 --> 43:12.485
All right. Okay.

43:12.505 --> 43:15.455
Uh, Mr. Daly?

43:15.475 --> 43:17.425
Oh, you do know my name?

43:17.445 --> 43:19.385
Just hold... hold... hold on.

43:19.405 --> 43:21.535
Just hold on a second. Excuse me.

43:24.575 --> 43:26.395
Mr. Daly?

43:26.415 --> 43:29.385
- You Dillard?
- Mm. Clara.

43:29.405 --> 43:30.425
Miles.

43:30.445 --> 43:33.555
- I've heard so much about you.
- Let's talk.

43:33.575 --> 43:35.515
You gonna be more helpful
than your colleague?

43:35.535 --> 43:37.425
'Cause I was just heading out.

43:37.445 --> 43:39.131
I wasn't going to mention it,

43:39.138 --> 43:41.445
but you're actually not free to leave.

43:41.465 --> 43:44.365
Might as well talk. Please.

43:51.475 --> 43:53.375
I got it.

43:55.575 --> 43:58.405
Think you heard what we were discussing.

43:58.425 --> 44:00.575
- We all want the same thi...
- Where's Rick?

44:01.085 --> 44:02.085
We'll get to that.

44:02.092 --> 44:03.829
I need to start with that.

44:05.365 --> 44:07.505
He was doing all right, last I saw him.

44:07.525 --> 44:09.415
Where?

44:12.149 --> 44:13.229
Can't remember.

44:13.273 --> 44:16.223
You've come to us, which I
consider an act of good faith,

44:16.247 --> 44:18.177
so it wouldn't be fair
if I didn't tell you

44:18.197 --> 44:19.604
what you're up against.

44:19.676 --> 44:21.620
We have copies of the LLC paperwork

44:21.640 --> 44:23.740
of "The Admiral's Mistress"
with your signature,

44:23.760 --> 44:24.790
security footage of you

44:24.810 --> 44:27.670
with cash given to you
by Amara De Escalones

44:27.690 --> 44:30.314
and then transported across state lines.

44:30.328 --> 44:32.508
We have transcripts
of eyewitness testimony.

44:33.089 --> 44:35.592
And if you've tampered
with a Federal witness,

44:35.720 --> 44:38.610
- much as I would like to help...
- Rick is fine.

44:38.630 --> 44:42.557
I can't discuss this any further
for myself and Louis Darnell.

44:42.750 --> 44:43.780
With the evidence I've described,

44:43.800 --> 44:47.660
do you think the Bureau
is gonna offer immunity?

44:49.792 --> 44:52.912
You haven't made a single arrest.

44:53.790 --> 44:56.790
Why is that?

44:56.810 --> 44:59.620
What are you waiting for?

45:01.690 --> 45:04.680
You tell the Bureau that
I convinced the fucking cartel

45:04.700 --> 45:07.730
to run $30 million through my film.

45:07.750 --> 45:11.650
You get names, banks, account numbers.

45:11.670 --> 45:13.780
I'm the only one who can pull that off.

45:13.800 --> 45:17.770
But if you try and arrest me
or I leave here without a deal,

45:17.790 --> 45:19.760
everyone from Hollywood to Juárez

45:19.780 --> 45:21.720
will know what you're up to.

45:21.740 --> 45:24.740
Sweetheart, work with us.

45:24.760 --> 45:27.640
Don't try and blackmail the Bureau.

45:27.660 --> 45:28.760
I know the director of the L.A. office.

45:28.780 --> 45:30.690
He doesn't respond
to being pushed around.

45:30.710 --> 45:33.690
I'm thinking of this as a collaboration.

45:33.710 --> 45:34.760
Films fall through,

45:34.780 --> 45:36.750
- and if this doesn't come to...
- It's already done.

45:36.770 --> 45:38.660
I'm saying if something happens,

45:38.680 --> 45:40.690
the Bureau will punish you,

45:40.710 --> 45:43.720
and I won't be able to help.

45:45.800 --> 45:49.079
Clara, this is gonna be
a beautiful film.

45:49.130 --> 45:50.230
Beautiful.

45:50.750 --> 45:54.580
Wait until you see it.

45:54.600 --> 45:55.750
Excuse me.
