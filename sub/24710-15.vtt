I'm four years fightin'

00:37.787 --> 00:39.914
and this McCree's at home,

00:39.998 --> 00:43.877
fakin' his back problem
and advancin' his career.

00:44.085 --> 00:49.132
And this Mick bastard is gonna fire me?
Gonna call me drunk?

00:49.466 --> 00:51.885
Or I neglected a block of my meters?

00:52.093 --> 00:55.096
I'm gonna draw up a list
of grievances on him!

(INHALING DEEPLY)

01:04.064 --> 01:08.193
I got an idea.
Let me go read my route now.

01:11.446 --> 01:17.535
Let him know that I made my job.
Let me go read my meters for my boss.

01:27.837 --> 01:28.922
You want a fish?

01:30.965 --> 01:33.426

01:56.324 --> 02:01.704
(SOBS) What did he think I meant?
Did he have to claw me with a hammer?

02:02.413 --> 02:06.793
I was tryin' to come in.
I was tryin' to read his meter.

02:07.168 --> 02:11.881
I did not kick in his door.
I did not intentionally kick his door in!

02:12.757 --> 02:18.012
Now, I'm gonna have to be hospitalized,
and I'll unfairly never get my job back.

02:18.513 --> 02:23.184

Look at my eye!

-Mornin', Andy.
-ANDY: This is a street dealer

04:20.134 --> 04:24.138
named Billy Willis, that Baker
that accidentally shot Szymanski?

04:25.306 --> 04:27.684
-Baker put this dealer down too?
-(SIGHS)

04:28.476 --> 04:30.019
Maybe it was just an act of God.

-Mornin'.
-Mornin', Danny.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.447
-DIANE: Morning.
-This guy threw down on Baker?

04:41.531 --> 04:43.658
Yeah, although we haven't been able
to recover his gun.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.870
-No witnesses yet verifyin' he had one.
-Try a canvass?

04:47.954 --> 04:51.708
-Yeah, that should be productive.
-Yeah, good luck on this corner.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.711
You got the history on Baker.

04:58.172 --> 05:01.259
Hey, Andy, that kid on the corner
with the knit cap, he's a CI of mine.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.845
If he's hangin' here,
he's got somethin' for us.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.347
How you doin', Baker?

05:06.848 --> 05:10.101
I don't know what the hell's in his mind.
Four times I tell him, "Freeze, get down."

05:10.184 --> 05:11.185
Take it easy, kid.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.355
I was on foot post.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.650
Gun run comes on the radio.
Two guys with guns.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.321
Come around the corner, there they are,
perfect fit for the description.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.574
-Dope slingers.
-One guy boogies. This one, I tell him,

05:24.657 --> 05:27.869
"Freeze and drop." He goes for his gun.
I don’t know what’s in his mind.

05:27.952 --> 05:28.953
ANDY: All right.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.998
Now, they say,
"There’s no gun on the DOA."

05:40.840 --> 05:42.258
Let’s get you back to the house, Neil.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.762
Yeah, all right. Y... you mind
if we look around here a little bit?

05:45.887 --> 05:47.180
No, sure. That’s fine.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.812
ANDY:
All right, the both of you, stand still.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.356
-What? For what?
-ANDY: Hey. Hey, hey.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.774
POLICE OFFICER: Hey! Hey!

05:58.066 --> 06:01.152
Must be some jones you got
tryin’ to score with us in the street.

06:01.319 --> 06:02.987
Hey, I didn’t mean
to be disrespectful, sir.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.864
-Did I see you with him last week?
-J.B.: With who?

06:04.947 --> 06:08.368
What are you? A smart‐ass?
I saw you with that guy last week.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.578
I wasn’t with him.
I was in Perth Amboy at my cousin’s.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.789
You’re a lyin’ piece of crap,
and you’re comin’ into the house.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.958
(GRUNTS) Let me show up in 20 minutes,
boss. I promise I'll show up.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.295
Let's see, this is a 30‐day month,
so I don’t think I can do that.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.632
-I swear he had a gun on him.
-All right, Neil.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.801
I'll swear that in front of IAB

06:26.260 --> 06:28.054
Look for his piece, would you, Mike?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.806
Yeah, we're definitely gonna keep lookin'.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.699
You're makin'
a career gettin' me outta jams.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.080
The second instance in six weeks
I've fired my weapon.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.833
Under totally different circumstances,
correct?

06:57.166 --> 07:00.169
-Totally. That's right.
-So then forget about six weeks ago.

07:07.802 --> 07:12.390
And the other potential jackpot here
is the DOA's gun bein' missin'.

07:13.057 --> 07:15.351
Neil, a shooting at a known drug corner,

07:15.435 --> 07:17.603
second perp boogies
with the cop in pursuit.

07:17.812 --> 07:20.523
When I worked narcotics,
the skells'd hang their heads in shame

07:20.606 --> 07:22.733
if one of 'em didn't glom
the DOA's weapon.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.902
I'm only sayin' it don't smell good.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.406
The bad smell, Neil,
is the cop-filled-with-doubt aroma

07:28.531 --> 07:31.159
comin' off of you, that probably you want
to do somethin' about

07:31.284 --> 07:33.161
before your rat squad interview...

07:33.619 --> 07:36.998
'cause that's the whiff
whets them cheese-eaters' appetites.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.375
All right.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.962
Got a good act, old man.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.673
Danny and me worked
the same corner several years.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.384
I got somethin' for him as soon
as I get some reassurance

07:48.468 --> 07:50.219
on a previous commitment he made.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.680
Yeah. He tends to be good with that stuff.

08:07.778 --> 08:11.073
-IAB's here.
-And you want to talk to 'em, right?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.034
Absolutely.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.372
-Ready to give your statement, officer?
-Yes, I am.

08:23.544 --> 08:24.712
Come on.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.387
Some hell of a thing on this shooting.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.015
-What do you got, J.B.?
-Willis got shot, no?

08:36.140 --> 08:37.934
Yeah. Dealer named Willis.

08:38.601 --> 08:42.063
Cop takes him down. I guess you guys want
to exonerate that behavior.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.106
Let us know when you're done
clearin' your throat.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.901
I understood from Danny,
I had a whole credit buildup

08:46.984 --> 08:51.113
like some mutual fund off
previous cooperation I already gave?

08:51.280 --> 08:54.700
-The Zancanellis.
-This is just addin' to the wealth.

08:54.867 --> 08:55.952
No, what I was told by Danny,

08:56.035 --> 08:58.579
some mysterious way,
this is gonna further my singing career.

08:58.663 --> 09:02.792
You want jerk-off passes to CBGBs, J.B.,
I'll get you those tonight.

09:02.959 --> 09:07.255
I'm workin' on somethin' substantial.
Sings doo-wop like Dion, J.B.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.298
Don't get extravagant.

09:09.465 --> 09:11.676
(SCOFFS) Ready for what I observed?

09:13.719 --> 09:16.597
You know, the one cop showed up early,
I guess he was on foot post.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.016
Sector cars rollin' up right after.

09:19.141 --> 09:21.894
Then I got to figure
some of these young bloods runnin' a game.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.939
They call 911, these kids,
report drug activity.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.984
Sector cars roll up,
dealers drop their stashes,

09:28.067 --> 09:30.278
these kids come swoopin' up the decks.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.863
Except, how long you expect
to live doin' that?

09:33.072 --> 09:35.283
These young bloods
scoopin' up the decks of dope,

09:35.366 --> 09:38.244
the dealers throw down
when the sector cars came rollin' up.

09:38.494 --> 09:41.664
You think they might've scooped up
Willis' gun at the same time?

09:42.248 --> 09:43.457
It's a theory.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.002
A 100 if you got a name
who grabbed the piece.

09:46.168 --> 09:49.505
(SIGHS) If I had a name,
I'd make a price for it,

09:49.672 --> 09:52.174
and we'd do business, or we wouldn't.

09:52.967 --> 09:56.220
Excuse me. Stubbin' my toe
on your huge moral standards.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.807
A couple elections, he'll probably be
our representative in congress.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.979
You're not playin' me off
on this singing thing. Are you, Danny?

10:05.187 --> 10:07.773
J.B., how about you gettin'
some recording time in a studio

10:07.857 --> 10:09.942
-the feds got infiltrated?
-Serious?

10:10.151 --> 10:13.738
-I'm lookin' to make it happen.
-I'll get the guy who grabbed the piece up

10:13.904 --> 10:15.823
and all his living cousins.

10:19.327 --> 10:23.289
The radio run gave a detailed description
of two guys carrying guns.

10:24.373 --> 10:28.794
So, on arrival at the scene, I approached
two men who fit the descriptions.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.547
This job was assigned to a radio car.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.300
Shouldn't you have waited
and acted as backup?

10:34.508 --> 10:38.220
They saw me comin' around the corner,
Willis and the other dealer.

10:38.304 --> 10:41.724
-I didn't want to lose them.
-Did you actually see Willis dealing?

10:42.600 --> 10:45.603
I assumed he was,
because when I was spotted,

10:45.978 --> 10:48.814
-he ditched a deck of heroin.
-Which you recovered?

10:50.191 --> 10:52.276
It must've gotten stolen with the gun.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.993
You approach... your weapon drawn
at this point?

11:01.410 --> 11:04.538
It was a gun run, so, yeah,
it was at my side.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.875
I approach Willis. I said, "Freeze."

11:08.292 --> 11:10.419
His running buddy immediately boogied.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.798
So I stayed on Willis
and told him, "Freeze" again.

11:14.131 --> 11:16.801
More directly. He started backin' away...

11:17.218 --> 11:20.304
reachin' into his jacket,
his back waistband.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.391
At this point, I'm aimin' at him.

11:24.141 --> 11:28.521
Again I tell him, "Freeze and get down,"
but he keeps movin'.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.607
He starts pullin' his hand
out of his jacket.

11:31.691 --> 11:37.405
I tell him to freeze again. "Freeze.
Don't move your hand. Get on the ground."

11:37.613 --> 11:41.242
And he starts jerking his elbow out
like he's tryin' to draw his gun. (PANTS)

11:45.079 --> 11:46.539
At that point, I opened fire.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.293
Take a moment.

11:55.589 --> 11:59.135
So after I fired, twice... (PANTS)

12:00.553 --> 12:02.847
...I approached Willis,
who was on the ground...

12:03.848 --> 12:07.601
and checked for his pulse...
which he didn't have one.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.938
And then,
I went after Willis' running buddy,

12:11.188 --> 12:12.773
thinkin' he was armed as well.

12:15.109 --> 12:18.612
Did Willis ever get the gun
past his jacket to aim it at you?

12:21.073 --> 12:24.660
Did you ever actually see the gun
or just Willis' hand?

12:25.578 --> 12:29.206
I saw his hand on a gun,
attempting to draw it.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.459
Automatic or revolver?

12:33.377 --> 12:36.630
-(EXHALES) I only saw the butt.
-JERRY: In your own mind...

12:37.715 --> 12:40.760
was there any course of action
you could've taken besides shooting?

12:43.971 --> 12:45.931
No. (EXHALES)

12:46.056 --> 12:47.391
I don't think so.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.275
When the collars from the drug sweep
are brought in,

12:56.400 --> 12:58.778
I'll be conducting interviews parallel
with the squad.

12:59.403 --> 13:03.199
Meantime, you're off the streets,
assigned to the station house.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.118
Consider the investigation ongoin'.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.084
(DOOR OPENING)

13:19.215 --> 13:21.759
-You were watchin'.
-Yeah, I was watchin'.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.677
How do you think it went?

13:24.261 --> 13:26.347
Neil, did you do wrong
on the street this mornin'?

13:26.931 --> 13:28.224
No.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.812
Then why in the hell did you let any doubt
about that in the room with IAB?

13:33.312 --> 13:35.689
I saw his eyes go to glass, Willis.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.193
I saw his posture,
how he reached in his jacket.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.237
It all said gun...

13:41.779 --> 13:42.822
(SIGHS)

13:43.322 --> 13:45.157
...but I never saw the gun entirely.

13:47.952 --> 13:51.288
And I couldn't tell you with a pure heart
whether he ever had one or not.

13:51.372 --> 13:54.166
Neil, my partner and me,
we got good leads in this case.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.211
We think we got a way to Willis' gun
and Willis' running buddy.

13:57.586 --> 13:59.672
You just sit tight
till we come in with 'em.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.240
Hi.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.870
How's it goin', Vince?
What are you doin' here?

14:31.036 --> 14:34.248
I'd like you to open up a case for me,
Andy. Major pain in the balls.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.835
-I'm workin' a cop-shot-a-guy.
-Andy, I'm up to my neck in hot water.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.003
I'm in a big pot,
and they're gettin' ready

14:39.086 --> 14:41.213
-to boil and eat me.
-(SIGHS)

14:44.216 --> 14:45.926
Russell's up. Talk to her.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.220
I'd prefer Martinez or Medavoy.

14:48.387 --> 14:51.348
Russell's up.
Hey, you remember Vince Gotelli?

14:53.767 --> 14:56.770
-How's it goin', Vince?
-He's about to be boiled and eaten.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.982
Why don't you take him inside there,
get him a cup of coffee?

15:01.150 --> 15:03.736
-You know my partner, Jill Kirkendall.
-Yeah.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.238
-Hey, Vince. How's it goin'?
-Not so hot.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.828
Unofficially, I understood that you
and Simone were married.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.581
Uh... Hmm. That's right.

15:15.748 --> 15:19.084
-In any regard, my condolences.
-Thanks.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.463
I, uh, hope
the union was helpful after he passed.

15:22.546 --> 15:23.797
Yeah, they were.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.216
You know, I was formerly a delegate.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.761
What did you want to see us about, Vince?

15:29.053 --> 15:34.016
Well, as you know,
I'm an independent insurance adjuster.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.561
And one of my contracts
is with Vigilance Life.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.356
They in turn insure Roma Auto Leasing,

15:40.439 --> 15:44.693
which has a Toyota Camry
on a 12-month lease to a mobbed-up moron.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.947
Keeps repeatedly getting the crap
beat out of the vehicle.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.617
Crap beat out, like, uh, slashed tires?

15:51.700 --> 15:54.203
Well, soup-to-nuts
is what happens to that car.

15:54.536 --> 15:58.040
You know?
Busted windshield, uh, slashed upholstery.

15:58.207 --> 16:02.086
We're talkin', uh, three vandalisms
in the last three months.

16:02.378 --> 16:06.173
-Huh? And then again two nights ago.
-The mobbed-up guy cooperating with you?

16:06.256 --> 16:08.801
Yeah, he cooperates askin' to get
his car repaired.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.929
What he don't cooperate with
is who's workin' out on the Camry

16:12.054 --> 16:13.472
with the Louisville slugger.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.808
You think his car troubles
are work-related?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.894
Work-related car problems
in his chosen field

16:18.978 --> 16:22.439
usually involves an explosion.
I think it's the downstairs neighbor.

16:22.564 --> 16:25.901
They've got some ongoing dispute
over who dries their laundry when.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.653
What do you want us to do, Vince?

16:28.237 --> 16:32.241
Well... maybe try to get the mobbed-up guy
to file a complaint.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.076
Get the wheels of justice turning.

16:35.202 --> 16:37.079
Okay. Here you go.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.542
All right.

16:41.750 --> 16:46.213
The mobbed-up guy's Messina.
Downstairs neighbor's Grotowski.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.090
Maybe you could bring the both of them in.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.260
Otherwise... (SIGHS)
...I'm gonna lose that Vigilance account.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.099
(SIGHS)

16:58.225 --> 17:00.853
I want Baker right on the DOA
havin' a piece,

17:00.978 --> 17:04.648
-but something's hangin' over him.
-Not everybody's supposed to be a cop.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.156
(CLEARS THROAT)

17:16.452 --> 17:17.619
What are you doin'?

17:19.455 --> 17:20.748
Working at my desk.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.587
And filing.

17:35.929 --> 17:39.141
I, uh, I've been havin' a dream
comin' up on me.

17:40.517 --> 17:43.312
-How do you make out?
-Not that type.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.565
It's off all that mess with Dornan.

17:48.650 --> 17:52.112
In the dream,
Dornan puts my old man's eye out.

17:53.113 --> 17:57.868
My old man lost his eye when I was a kid.
He read meters for the gas company.

17:58.577 --> 18:01.997
And one of 'em put his eye out
in a project with a claw hammer.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.916
-A Black guy.
-Hey...

18:05.793 --> 18:08.670
you do this. You don't use that language.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.635
(EXHALES)
Anyways, Dornan put your dad's eye out?

18:16.053 --> 18:17.971
What I don't get,
Dornan don't seem the type.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.725
-He seems like a right guy.
-He does seem like a right guy.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.103
Well, how does he account for it
in the dream?

18:24.228 --> 18:26.605
(SCOFFS)
He don't say anything. He's not in it.

18:26.855 --> 18:29.775
My pop just says,
"Your buddy Dornan did this."

18:29.900 --> 18:31.360
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

18:35.114 --> 18:36.365
15th squad.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.495
What's he wearin'?

18:45.165 --> 18:46.333
You're the man, J.B.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.253
-Purcell Watkins.
-Is who?

18:49.336 --> 18:52.131
He dropped the dime to 911
to get the sector cars rollin'.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.259
He's at that half-assed video arcade
on fourth street.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.471
Try to get them 911 tapes
from communications.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.765
Hey, resume your position.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.831
If you're busy, this is an absolutely
unnecessary communication, but...

19:26.290 --> 19:28.375
I did want to give you
sort of a status report,

19:28.458 --> 19:32.171
which is just to say how happy I am
to be working in the squad

19:32.254 --> 19:33.672
and the sense I have,

19:33.881 --> 19:36.800
without being a Pollyanna, that...
I hope I'm fitting in.

19:39.803 --> 19:43.765
Just as an example, a little earlier,
I sensed that Detective Sipowicz wanted

19:43.849 --> 19:45.934
to have a private moment
with Detective Sorenson,

19:46.143 --> 19:49.605
and instead of just being awkward,
I think I was able to make

19:49.688 --> 19:53.650
a little joke about it
and give them their space, and...

19:54.026 --> 19:57.029
I had the feeling afterward,
a... as they left to pick up a suspect,

19:57.112 --> 20:00.866
that Detective Sipowicz made
a little teasing remark,

20:00.949 --> 20:03.911
which... I think was actually
an acknowledgment of some sort

20:03.994 --> 20:06.246
of the effort I'd made before.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.640
Sit down.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.394
Sorry we don't got none
of those stupid earphones

20:29.478 --> 20:30.896
for you to listen to this with.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.940
PURCELL: (OVER TAPE) They're dealin' drugs
out there on that corner.

20:33.023 --> 20:36.944
One's in a green hat and a blue jacket.
His gun's in the back in his pants.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.072
-Who's that supposed to be?
-DANNY: That's you, Purcell,

20:40.155 --> 20:41.823
lookin' to get the cops
rollin' up on the corner

20:41.907 --> 20:44.826
so Billy Willis will drop his dope
and you can pick it up.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.246
Except how it went down
on this particular occasion,

20:47.329 --> 20:50.457
Billy got shot,
and you're looking at accessory to murder.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.918
-That ain't my voice.
-That is your voice,

20:53.126 --> 20:56.713
identified by three,
separate forensic laboratories.

20:58.006 --> 21:02.427
And how you go from accessory to murder
to just a bystanding scammer

21:02.511 --> 21:05.764
is givin' up the straight story
on how that shooting went down.

21:10.894 --> 21:15.357
Here I go. A minute after that phone call,
a cop walked up on Billy,

21:15.482 --> 21:18.026
to which I'm, like,
"Damn, that's some fast police response."

21:18.610 --> 21:21.363
Cop's like, "Freeze. Hands
where I can see 'em. Freeze. Freeze."

21:21.446 --> 21:23.865
But Billy keep backin' away
and put his hand in his jacket.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.119
Who grabbed up Willis' gun
after the cop put Willis down?

21:27.369 --> 21:29.705
Man, how am I gonna do that
and keep my self-respect?

21:29.788 --> 21:32.207
How much self-respect
you gonna have in the joint

21:32.291 --> 21:34.209
after they bust you wide open

21:34.293 --> 21:37.212
and you're wearin' diapers
for undergarments?

21:41.341 --> 21:43.802
After the cop put Billy down
and went after Billy's buddy,

21:43.885 --> 21:46.722
Jerome Banks went through Billy's pocket.
He's who got the gun.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.515
Jerome Banks.

21:49.516 --> 21:52.769
He stashed it where his girlfriend's at,
Apartment 3B.

21:53.061 --> 21:55.814
I don't know the street number,
but I'll take you to the building.

21:55.939 --> 21:57.107
Let's do it.

21:57.190 --> 22:00.444
Look, we was just lookin' for free dope.
That cop walked up.

22:00.777 --> 22:03.488
I was beggin' Billy in my head,
"Please, just do what the cop say."

22:03.613 --> 22:04.740
But he won't do it.

22:05.949 --> 22:07.159
Then bam...

22:08.201 --> 22:09.411
game over.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.580
Yeah. Game over for Billy.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.944
I want to talk to Russell Kirkendall.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.156
-Excuse me?
-I'm Anthony Messina.

22:46.406 --> 22:49.368
(PANTING)
My insurance agent turned over my file.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.995
To Russell Kirkendall.
I'm here clearing the air

22:52.120 --> 22:54.664
before this deteriorates
any further directions.

22:54.998 --> 22:58.251
-Is Vince Gotelli your insurance agent?
-Yeah, correct.

22:58.418 --> 23:01.213
I'm Diane Russell.
This is my partner, Jill Kirkendall.

23:01.296 --> 23:03.298
-Hi.
-Anthony Messina.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.425
My impression's with this Gotelli guy,

23:05.509 --> 23:07.552
par for the course,
screwin' up your names.

23:07.761 --> 23:10.013
-Where we gonna talk?
-You want to talk here?

23:10.764 --> 23:12.766
I'll talk wherever you want to talk.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.102
My story ain't changing.

23:18.522 --> 23:21.483
-(CLEARS THROAT) Everybody ready?
-Go ahead.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.948
None of this is gonna work,
however I'm bein' set up.

23:28.824 --> 23:32.452
They can move, uh, five more FBI Pollocks
or IRS Pollocks,

23:32.536 --> 23:34.538
or whatever the hell agency
they got to work on it

23:34.621 --> 23:36.957
to beat on my windshield
for ten more years.

23:37.165 --> 23:40.585
So what I'm gonna do,
is keep filin' insurance claims.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.254
I am not getting provoked.

23:42.504 --> 23:45.632
I'm making no mistake
that gets my parole revoked.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.509
I am not gonna get locked up,

23:47.968 --> 23:50.762
and I am not putting myself
in a position to flip on Ronnie Persico,

23:50.971 --> 23:54.099
because I am not an idiot, all right?

23:54.975 --> 23:57.477
-Do you want some water?
-And you can just tell them

23:57.561 --> 23:59.354
that they can keep wastin' their film
in that surveillance camera

23:59.438 --> 24:01.314
that they put in that false transformer

24:01.398 --> 24:04.067
on the electrical pole that they put up
in my backyard last year.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.154
Anthony Messina ain't makin' a mistake.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.906
Are you sure
that's not a real transformer, Anthony?

24:10.073 --> 24:12.451
Do I look I could shimmy up the pole
and check for myself?

24:12.617 --> 24:14.286
I want no further contact on this!

24:14.369 --> 24:16.663
Could I...
Could I float an idea with you, Anthony?

24:16.746 --> 24:18.373
Then I'm gonna leave.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.792
If your downstairs neighbor
is working for the FBI,

24:20.876 --> 24:23.962
or if he's just pissed off
'cause your laundry's drippin' on his...

24:24.045 --> 24:25.589
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that cock-and-bull story.

24:25.755 --> 24:28.049
Knowing that it's him
vandalizing your car,

24:28.175 --> 24:30.469
as opposed to doin' somethin'
that'll get you locked up,

24:30.802 --> 24:33.388
-why not file a criminal complaint?
-Aye.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.808
Everybody's gotta work
their own side of the street.

24:37.058 --> 24:38.393
If he was beatin' up your windshield,

24:38.477 --> 24:40.937
would you hire me to shoot him
in the head?

24:49.446 --> 24:52.574
-Purcell got this to answer for.
-Yeah, you guys can exchange hate mail

24:52.657 --> 24:54.117
from your various jails.

24:54.201 --> 24:57.037
I'm sayin', he ratted me out,
and you still locked him up.

24:57.204 --> 25:00.207
-How am I supposed to cooperate off that?
-How 'bout 'cause if you don't,

25:00.290 --> 25:02.042
you're an accessory
to Billy Willis' death?

25:02.167 --> 25:03.168
I didn't kill nobody.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.754
No, you see,
if you killed somebody, Jerome,

25:05.837 --> 25:07.297
that would make you a murderer.

25:07.464 --> 25:11.259
What makes you an accessory
is glomming up Billy Willis' piece

25:11.343 --> 25:15.096
-after that cop had to shoot him.
-How you come to me being accessory

25:15.180 --> 25:17.557
of not finding no piece
in Clarice's apartment,

25:17.641 --> 25:20.810
-even though you tear it apart?
-'Cause we got numerous eyewitnesses

25:20.894 --> 25:23.063
to you grabbin' up Billy Willis' gun
on that street

25:23.146 --> 25:25.857
-after Billy Willis got shot.
-That's Purcell too,

25:25.941 --> 25:27.817
your "numerous eyewitnesses."

25:27.901 --> 25:31.821
What the hell are you and Clarice doing
with a 14-month-old baby, anyways?

25:31.905 --> 25:33.865
What are you? A... a fast 15?

25:34.032 --> 25:37.077
I'm 16, on my own, and a man since I'm 12.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.205
-Man have children.
-Man go to jail, also, Jerome,

25:40.330 --> 25:42.415
unless he helps us
with that piece he grabbed up.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.668
And maybe also kicks
in what he saw go down

25:44.751 --> 25:47.045
as far as Billy Willis
forcing that cop's hand.

25:47.128 --> 25:49.172
-Oh, is that what happened?
-Is it?

25:49.339 --> 25:52.342
-You tell us.
-Tell you why? I don't hear no assurances.

25:52.425 --> 25:56.304
Right now, the big assurance you got
is if you don't tell us,

25:56.388 --> 25:59.891
your nuts are gonna look like
that, uh, that the scavenger dog

26:00.016 --> 26:02.435
after he gets flattened
in them cartoons.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.271
Jerome, Billy Willis' piece

26:04.354 --> 26:06.106
and what happened on the street,
you skate.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.738
Far as Billy Willis,
he was all cracked up.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.699
Facedown police, you askin' to die.

26:15.865 --> 26:18.243
-Did Billy Willis draw his gun?
-He was reachin'.

26:18.326 --> 26:19.995
Where's that gun now?

26:22.163 --> 26:26.209
Seventh and C.
I got this other girl, Chanel.

26:26.459 --> 26:27.752
We got a baby too.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.838
Gun's in the baby's crib
underneath the mattress.

26:32.215 --> 26:33.717
Write Chanel's address.

26:35.635 --> 26:38.888
Fifteen years old,
got children by two different women.

26:39.097 --> 26:40.181
PURCELL: I'm 16.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.892
-Wile E. Coyote.
-What?

26:43.351 --> 26:46.271
The scavenger dog in the cartoon
is Wile E. Coyote.

26:50.233 --> 26:52.027
-You got a minute?
-Yeah, sure.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.946
I know her address and apartment number

26:55.030 --> 26:58.241
-because I pay the rent.
-Yeah, you're father of the year.

26:59.492 --> 27:02.287
-You got a CI named J.B. Murphy?
-What did he do?

27:02.412 --> 27:03.997
He transacted in plain sight.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.333
collared him in this deal
with Shawn Jackson.

27:06.541 --> 27:08.335
This J.B. keeps pissin' and moanin',

27:08.418 --> 27:10.587
"Talk to Danny Sorenson,
talk to Danny Sorenson."

27:10.670 --> 27:11.671
Out loud?

27:11.796 --> 27:13.882
Out loud till I nearly gave him
a smack to shut him up.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.217
He could've been workin' somethin'
out there, Shannon,

27:16.301 --> 27:17.677
looking to get himself busted.

27:17.927 --> 27:19.929
Could you hold off on vouchering
the dope he copped

27:20.013 --> 27:21.723
-till I see what's what?
-Sure.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.600
He's in the holdin' cell
next to the other mope.

27:23.767 --> 27:26.227
Yeah, the other mope
may be who he wants me to see.

27:26.394 --> 27:28.855
-Appreciate it.
-How's your sister?

27:29.230 --> 27:30.732
Good. She's good.

27:44.496 --> 27:48.667
-Danny, can you help me out here?
-Help you? How J.B.?

27:48.750 --> 27:50.919
What do you got to make it worth my while?

27:51.002 --> 27:53.004
Hey, I banked plenty of favors with you.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.839
You know what?
There goes my Alzheimer's kicking in.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.257
You got nothin' fresh for me,

27:56.341 --> 27:59.803
-I'll see you in several months.
-Oh, I can't believe this!

28:00.011 --> 28:02.639
Believe it, J.B. Watch me walk away.

28:07.977 --> 28:10.855
-What?
-(MOUTHING)

28:11.773 --> 28:12.857
(MOUTHS) Who's that?

28:14.317 --> 28:15.860
(WHISPERING)
That the cop who shot in the street,

28:15.944 --> 28:17.946
he said
you all wanted information on that.

28:18.488 --> 28:21.241
Man, do you want to talk, or what?
(WHISPERS) I can't hear you.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.827
Sure. Let's chat. Keys.

28:28.498 --> 28:30.667
-You gonna behave yourself?
-SHAWN: You know it.

28:31.376 --> 28:34.671
-Make 'em put it in writing, Jackson.
-Sore loser.

28:36.423 --> 28:37.549
(LAUGHS)

28:39.676 --> 28:40.802
Have a seat, Mr. Grotowski.

28:40.885 --> 28:43.221
You don't think
scrap iron's a real business?

28:43.304 --> 28:46.349
Sure, we do.
We appreciate your comin' in.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.602
You know, there's been
a rash of auto vandalism

28:49.686 --> 28:51.020
around your residence.

28:51.229 --> 28:54.232
Specifically, your upstairs
neighbor's car, Anthony Messina.

28:54.315 --> 28:57.777
You mean, the <i>Godfather,</i>
Scarface, Al Capone?

28:58.445 --> 29:00.905
You're aware
Mr. Messina's car has been vandalized

29:00.989 --> 29:02.866
three times in the last several months?

29:03.450 --> 29:07.412
Being Mr. Messina's downstairs neighbor,
have the two of you had any problems?

29:07.537 --> 29:13.334
The only problem I got is his laundry
drip, drip, drips onto ours,

29:13.418 --> 29:16.171
'cause my wife hangs ours out
at a decent hour,

29:16.254 --> 29:19.549
not like his guinea mobster wife
who sleeps till 11,

29:19.632 --> 29:21.384
does the wash the afternoon.

29:21.968 --> 29:26.598
You ever taken a few whacks on his car
with a baseball bat over his wash

29:26.681 --> 29:29.267
drip, drip, dripping onto yours?

29:29.434 --> 29:33.021
Hey, why don't you suspect
some of his guinea mobster friends?

29:33.271 --> 29:36.024
I'm just an ignorant Pollock,
runs a scrap iron business.

29:36.524 --> 29:37.650
No, Mr. Grotowski,

29:37.734 --> 29:40.069
you're the downstairs neighbor
with a temper

29:40.153 --> 29:43.031
whose laundry is gettin' dripped,
dripped, dripped on.

29:43.114 --> 29:44.866
And if Mr. Messina's car
gets smashed up again,

29:44.949 --> 29:46.075
it's you we're gonna collar.

29:46.159 --> 29:49.412
So, this guy gets mentioned
on all the news shows,

29:49.496 --> 29:53.249
bein' mob-connected and this and that,
and I'm the one you're gonna arrest?

29:53.875 --> 29:56.961
If you go after his car again, absolutely.

29:59.005 --> 30:01.341
-Through?
-Yeah, we're through.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.303
(SCOFFS)

30:07.764 --> 30:10.058
This guy's liable to parlay
a beef over his laundry

30:10.141 --> 30:13.061
into a bullet in his ear
and a <i>TV Guide</i> stuffed in his mouth.

30:13.478 --> 30:16.564
Hope Vince's company
carries his life insurance.

30:31.996 --> 30:34.833
-How'd you do?
-Right where Jerome said it'd be,

30:34.916 --> 30:37.126
right under the mattress,
in the baby's crib.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.128
Puttin' the gun under a kid's mattress!

30:40.046 --> 30:42.799
My CI brought
in this dead Willis' running buddy.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.801
(FAUCET SQUEAKING)

30:47.887 --> 30:49.722
We took a collar with the guy.

30:50.723 --> 30:53.226
I should've stopped at a gift shop
to buy a bow.

30:53.309 --> 30:55.645
We could put around all this for Martens.

30:57.438 --> 30:59.107
This still don't refute
what you were thinking

30:59.190 --> 31:00.567
out loud before, Andy.

31:01.150 --> 31:03.319
Maybe Baker's not supposed to be a cop.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.614
Leave that to the rat squad to decide.

31:08.658 --> 31:09.742
(SIGHS)

31:14.706 --> 31:15.915
Hey, uh...

31:16.958 --> 31:18.668
I appreciate you listenin'

31:19.335 --> 31:23.006
when I was rattlin' on
before about my dream life.

31:25.174 --> 31:26.426
Sure.

31:31.764 --> 31:32.974
Maybe you call Dornan.

31:35.101 --> 31:36.144
For what?

31:37.478 --> 31:39.355
Maybe your dream's sayin' call him.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.275
Yeah, I'll tell him
I've been dreamin' about him.

31:42.442 --> 31:44.402
And was he thinking about me likewise?

31:44.694 --> 31:47.155
And we'll end up exchangin'
boxes of chocolates.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.656
(DOOR OPENING)

31:56.331 --> 31:58.917
-Night, Andy.
-Yeah. Good night.

32:11.554 --> 32:14.265
So, you just wanted
some silent companionship?

32:15.391 --> 32:18.978
-I'm making at a right shoot.
-How's it anything but?

32:19.187 --> 32:21.689
I'm sayin'... with the DOA's
runnin' buddy backing

32:21.773 --> 32:24.776
the other statements,
I'm makin' the shoot right.

32:26.945 --> 32:30.823
-You gonna tell Baker he's okay?
-Can't until I walk it through my office.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.035
But it's all right if I do?

32:35.411 --> 32:36.704
All right.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.042
These are the ones I lose sleep over.

32:41.501 --> 32:44.587
The cops I make right,
that maybe shouldn't be on the street.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.133
How's it goin'?

32:51.970 --> 32:54.722
-(CLEARS THROAT) Got a minute?
-Sure. How's it goin'?

33:11.447 --> 33:13.741
-So, what's your impression?
-(DOOR CLOSING)

33:14.033 --> 33:15.660
IAB's makin' you right, Neil.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.787
Your impression,
or you know that for a fact?

33:17.996 --> 33:20.540
They're makin' you right
for what happened in the street.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.836
-What's the other shoe?
-I'm not worried where you stand

33:24.919 --> 33:25.962
with IAB, Neil.

33:26.295 --> 33:28.256
I'm worried if there's somethin' else
goin' on with you,

33:28.339 --> 33:30.008
and that's the other shoe
that's gonna drop.

33:30.091 --> 33:33.261
So, what do you got to bat for me for
if you're questioning my fitness to serve?

33:33.428 --> 33:37.223
Listen to me, Neil. That fear I said
this morning I sensed comin' off of you,

33:37.306 --> 33:39.058
a skell feels that too.

33:39.225 --> 33:41.227
He can hear "Freeze"
comin' out your mouth,

33:41.310 --> 33:44.647
but let him be whacked out on enough crack
and feeling fear coming off of you,

33:44.731 --> 33:47.191
maybe he decides
you don't got it up to back your play.

33:47.316 --> 33:50.028
-So you never felt fear?
-Not in what my intentions were,

33:50.153 --> 33:53.072
-or should I be where I was.
-Never questioned yourself tactically?

33:53.156 --> 33:56.826
Should I be where I was
in terms of bein' on this job, Neil.

34:07.837 --> 34:09.047
(SIGHS)

34:11.090 --> 34:13.551
Of course I question myself over tactics.

34:19.348 --> 34:23.311
My son's got a condition
where he requires constant care.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.314
They didn't think he'd live past five.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.318
But now, they think
he could live upwards of 15 or 20 years.

34:35.615 --> 34:37.742
Everyone worries for their family, Neil.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.161
No, I know.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.663
But bringin' those worries
onto the street,

34:42.747 --> 34:44.207
everything gets too crowded.

34:45.208 --> 34:49.212
All I'm asking you to think about, Neil,
whatever worries you're carrying,

34:49.712 --> 34:53.299
does not standing up strong enough early
put you in positions

34:53.382 --> 34:55.885
where you gotta break twice
as bad later on?

35:00.848 --> 35:02.016
Anyways...

35:02.892 --> 35:05.353
You're not gonna try
and get me put off the job?

35:05.812 --> 35:07.647
What you do from here, that's up to you.

35:16.656 --> 35:17.824
(DOOR OPENING)

35:18.658 --> 35:21.994
Hark, I believe I hear Judas Iscariot.

35:23.496 --> 35:26.833
Hey, what kind of impression
did I make on that cop, uh, Martenson?

35:26.916 --> 35:29.961
Martens. You did good.
You're gonna be 343'd

35:30.044 --> 35:31.921
in the complaint room
tomorrow morning, Jackson.

35:32.004 --> 35:34.799
-They're gonna kick you loose.
-343, huh?

35:34.882 --> 35:36.843
I'll play that tomorrow for my number.

35:36.926 --> 35:40.763
Meanwhile, what? I'm left here rotting
like the man from the iron mask?

35:40.930 --> 35:45.226
Only possibility I can see for you J.B.,
they find some procedural defect

35:45.309 --> 35:47.311
-in how you were searched.
-Oh, and that would jump up

35:47.395 --> 35:48.938
in the complaint room
tomorrow morning too?

35:49.105 --> 35:51.774
Yeah, if it occurs at all, that's where
it would happen. Live in hope.

35:51.858 --> 35:55.611
-Yeah, thanks very much.
-No, J.B., thank you.

35:56.946 --> 35:58.030

36:07.081 --> 36:10.668
"This is Vince, blah, blah, blah,
wait for the beep." No beep.

36:10.960 --> 36:14.130

-How does he stay in business?

36:15.464 --> 36:16.674
-Hi.
-Hey, Diane.

36:16.799 --> 36:18.926
-Hey.
-Andy went home?

36:19.427 --> 36:20.928
Mm-hmm.

36:23.973 --> 36:25.474
What's funny?

36:25.933 --> 36:28.436
Oh, this informant I got,
he makes me laugh.

36:29.562 --> 36:30.980
He's on a maintenance program,

36:31.105 --> 36:33.482
and when they give him
his daily dose in the clinic,

36:33.691 --> 36:36.402
he holds the methadone
in his mouth till he's on the street.

36:36.652 --> 36:38.988
Then he spits it
in this little plastic bottle he carries

36:39.071 --> 36:41.449
and sells that for money to cop.

36:43.242 --> 36:46.746
From that point, 8 a.m.,
till he lays his head down at night...

36:47.205 --> 36:50.374
ten times a minute, this J.B.
is lookin' over both his shoulders...

36:51.209 --> 36:52.877
which, as many hustles as he's workin'

36:53.085 --> 36:56.047
and as many switches off 'em
as he's trying to pull,

36:56.172 --> 36:58.466
-that's definitely the right approach.
-(CHUCKLES)

37:00.760 --> 37:02.386
Just makes me laugh.

37:03.137 --> 37:04.972
He's got such a positive attitude.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.559
Wants to sing doo-wop, J.B.

37:09.435 --> 37:11.062
Has he got a good voice?

37:11.562 --> 37:15.399
I'm afraid to ask him to sing.
I'll be so sad for him if he can't.

-Andy went home, huh?
-Yeah.

I was so proud of how Anthony
was conducting himself.

with turning the other cheek?

-A head caved in by a moron.
-Was Anthony your father?

Yeah, I'm his son, Paul.
It's good job of law enforcement.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.622
It's hard to enforce the law

-when no one makes a complaint, Paul.
-And you can tell that Pollock whack job

that the only pacifist in this family
is now dead.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.881

could use some support now, Paul.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.424
You hear that, Grotowski?

39:03.507 --> 39:05.176

you better make 'em set you

40:33.806 --> 40:36.475
how my dad lost his eye wasn't true.

40:37.101 --> 40:40.896
What I thought for the longest time.
I thought he was out on his route,

40:41.105 --> 40:43.858
at his proper appointed time...

40:45.192 --> 40:49.447
reading one of your meters
and got attacked with a claw hammer.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.577
(EXHALES) What I figured out now,

40:55.369 --> 40:59.081
off missin' his meter readings,
off being loaded...

40:59.999 --> 41:03.711
he'd already been fired
by his Irish supervisor, my old man.

then goes out again at night

41:08.174 --> 41:10.551
when no one's expecting a meter reader.

41:11.093 --> 41:15.347
Kicks down one of your doors,
and not knowing what the hell's goin' on,

41:15.681 --> 41:18.434
one of you, that's the occupant,
takes the hammer to him.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.229
That's how it must've happened.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.525

41:33.824 --> 41:34.992
how you people are.

41:36.035 --> 41:39.747
A... and as far
as changin' certain assumptions...

41:40.915 --> 41:43.918
I think a big part,
that's you, was responsible.

41:44.627 --> 41:46.629

clear up my dream.

-Yeah.
