WEBVTT

00:01.958 --> 00:04.091
In the beginning,
there was only one.

00:04.134 --> 00:06.745
A single black infinitude.

00:08.573 --> 00:11.054
Then the infinitude
found release,

00:11.098 --> 00:15.798
and, finally,
the darkness broke,
filling it with life...

00:23.197 --> 00:25.634
With the multi-verse.

00:25.677 --> 00:29.594
Every existence multiplied
by possibility.

00:29.638 --> 00:34.251
And spread out before
space and time
in infinite measure.

00:34.295 --> 00:36.601
Civilizations rose and fell.

00:36.645 --> 00:40.736
And rose again across
reality's grasping expanse.

00:40.779 --> 00:45.349
Life. A precious gift
persevering in the face
of every obstacle,

00:45.393 --> 00:49.266
until, finally, the age
of heroes was born.

00:50.659 --> 00:53.575
Chaos. The constant
enemy of life

00:53.618 --> 00:57.274
kept at bay by champions from across the multi-verse...

01:21.777 --> 01:26.129
...joining forces to fight
on behalf of all creation.

01:26.173 --> 01:29.480
They found each other
just in time,

01:29.524 --> 01:33.615
because now,
the entire multi-verse is about to come under attack.

01:35.617 --> 01:38.010
There is a malevolent force
at work,

01:38.054 --> 01:40.274
one driven by a singular goal.

01:40.317 --> 01:43.103
I hope you're watching,
big guy.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.283
The destruction
of all there is.

01:55.376 --> 01:56.855
I have planned,

01:56.899 --> 01:59.815
there are those who say
I have schemed,

02:01.817 --> 02:04.559
but the time for preparation
has passed.

02:05.255 --> 02:09.172
The Crisis is now upon us all.

02:09.216 --> 02:12.088
Holy crimson skies of death!

02:21.402 --> 02:25.319
The end of the world
is licking at our heels!

02:25.362 --> 02:27.799
Soon, thou shall be not
but dust,

02:27.843 --> 02:31.977
twisting and writhing
in the dead of space!

02:32.021 --> 02:35.416
-Not even Supergirl
will save you from...

02:57.394 --> 02:59.222
Guess Supergirl was able
to save you.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.529
Now, go! Run!

03:03.313 --> 03:05.489
Hey, Spike! Remember me?

03:05.533 --> 03:08.318
Ilana's worried about you.

03:08.362 --> 03:11.016
She knows you're afraid
of something,

03:11.060 --> 03:13.845
-but she just wants you
to come home.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.283
Come here.

03:29.731 --> 03:32.081
What's got
you so spooked, buddy?

03:40.698 --> 03:42.309
Every pet in National City
is having a nervous breakdown.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.485
This feels bigger
than Leviathan.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.704
The USGS didn't register
an early warning,

03:46.748 --> 03:48.576
-so it took everyone
completely by surprise.

03:48.619 --> 03:51.274
She does mean everyone
because this earthquake

03:51.318 --> 03:52.971
is quite, literally, worldwide.

03:53.015 --> 03:55.191
But the seismic activity wasn't
coming from within the planet,

03:55.235 --> 03:57.280
it's coming from without.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.542
-That's--
-Extra-normal.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.501
I was gonna say "impossible,"
but okay.

04:00.544 --> 04:02.807
Yes, yes, a fair descriptor.
As would be, uh...

04:02.851 --> 04:05.462
"unfeasible, unthinkable,
absurd, outlandish."

04:05.506 --> 04:06.724
But however you choose
to describe this event,

04:06.768 --> 04:08.422
one thing
is absolutely certain.

04:08.465 --> 04:11.033
-We have--
-A major crisis on our hands.

04:14.166 --> 04:17.257
The Monitor freed Mal?
I didn't know he was
of this universe.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.781
Yes, I thought the Monitor
was a Flash and Green Arrow's
problem.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.738
He's of every universe
and everyone's problem.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.872
Last year, he tested Kara
and Earth-1's heroes

04:23.915 --> 04:26.527
with Dr. Deegan
and the Book of Destiny.

04:26.570 --> 04:29.312
This year, he's testing me
to make sure
I'm ready for this.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.487
And what exactly is this?

04:30.531 --> 04:32.228
-Another reality wave?
-Not exactly.

04:34.404 --> 04:37.364
Whatever is it, it is
hurtling through space
at an impossible speed.

04:37.407 --> 04:40.715
I calculate it will reach
the edge of the universe
in exactly 5.3 hours,

04:40.758 --> 04:42.020
at which point,
it will boomerang back.

04:42.064 --> 04:44.501
Once it intersects again
with our solar system,

04:44.545 --> 04:49.332
the results will be,
in a word, cataclysmic.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.334
Exactly when will it reach us?

04:51.378 --> 04:53.031
There are too many variables
to calculate precisely,
but I will say this.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.730
If this wave isn't stopped
by tomorrow night...

04:55.773 --> 04:56.861
there will be no more us...

04:56.905 --> 05:00.822
no more future...
no more anything.

05:02.345 --> 05:05.522
Are there any
inhabited planets
in its trajectory?

05:05.566 --> 05:06.784
-Just one.

05:09.918 --> 05:11.485
Argo City.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.400
-Oh, my God. Superman's there
with Lois and...
-My mom.

05:13.443 --> 05:15.140
Can we warn them?

05:15.184 --> 05:17.360
Argo Harun-El sure makes
communication difficult,
but I will try.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.971
-How much time
do they have, Brainy?
-Not enough.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.367
Superman,
champion of Earth,

05:24.411 --> 05:26.543
who faced off with Doomsday,

05:26.587 --> 05:28.371
apprehended General Zod,

05:28.415 --> 05:29.590
and went toe-to-toe

05:29.633 --> 05:32.332
with dozens of Lex Luthor's
death traps,

05:32.375 --> 05:34.203
has finally met his match.

05:34.246 --> 05:36.640
-A dirty diaper.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.947
What do you think?
Front page news?

05:38.990 --> 05:40.775
Uh... I mean, I think
it's a little lowbrow

05:40.818 --> 05:43.255
-for Lois Lane.
-Lowbrow?

05:43.299 --> 05:44.822
If only the citizens of Earth

05:44.866 --> 05:47.651
could see Kal-El
struggling with spit up.

05:47.695 --> 05:50.045
Need I remind you, Miss Lane,

05:50.088 --> 05:51.525
uh, I have no powers here.

05:51.568 --> 05:53.614
Oh, don't you be blaming this
on the red sun, honey.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.790
Hey, buddy.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.966
-Yay, Daddy did it.
-Yeah, kinda.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.666
Jonathan really
has your eyes, huh?

06:02.710 --> 06:04.407
I'll take it...

06:04.451 --> 06:06.627
so long he has
your everything else.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.805
You know, when I used
to picture us together,

06:10.848 --> 06:12.502
we were always
living on Earth,

06:12.546 --> 06:14.504
and we had two kids.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.551
Well, I hate to break it
to you, Kansas,

06:17.594 --> 06:18.769
but prognostication

06:18.813 --> 06:20.510
is not one of your superpowers.

06:20.554 --> 06:22.338
Oh...

06:25.123 --> 06:26.516
Kal, Lois...

06:26.560 --> 06:28.431
Kara? In pants?

06:30.346 --> 06:31.565
How did she manage
to break through

06:31.608 --> 06:32.609
Argo's shield interference?

06:32.653 --> 06:34.611
Not well, apparently.

06:35.699 --> 06:38.310
Kal, Lois... Argo is in danger.

06:38.354 --> 06:40.008
You need to get out now!

06:53.195 --> 06:55.066
Alura!

06:55.110 --> 06:57.286
Kal, Lois, thank God.

06:57.329 --> 06:58.418
What's happening?

06:58.461 --> 06:59.549
A massive energy
is moving through space.

06:59.593 --> 07:00.985
It's killing everything
in its path.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.944
-How long do we have?
-Minutes!

07:02.987 --> 07:04.467
Quickly! With me!

07:06.687 --> 07:08.732
We must set a course for Earth.

07:08.776 --> 07:09.864
Hopefully, they'll have
enough time

07:09.907 --> 07:12.170
to stop this wave
before it hits.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.870
- Where are the rest?

07:15.913 --> 07:18.176
There are no others.
Only this one.

07:24.661 --> 07:27.098
We'll always
be with you, Jonathan.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.492
We will never leave you.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.059
Even in the face of our deaths.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.235
We love you.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.094
They're gone.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.279
And we're next.

08:22.937 --> 08:26.941
For a very long time,
I have hated this place.

08:26.984 --> 08:30.248
I think about all the people
that it took from me.

08:30.292 --> 08:33.556
It would just...
It would just make me
so angry.

08:35.688 --> 08:36.777
But you're not now.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.429
I'm still a little bit angry.

08:40.693 --> 08:43.260
This island taught me
to survive.

08:43.871 --> 08:46.613
It turned me into someone else.

08:46.656 --> 08:49.485
Somebody better than
the person I was before.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.796
So, despite my feelings...

08:57.928 --> 09:01.323
there are no stories
about the Green Arrow to tell

09:02.759 --> 09:05.327
if I don't make my way
to Lian Yu.

09:05.370 --> 09:08.330
And I'm also not standing,
at this moment...

09:09.636 --> 09:11.115
looking at my daughter.

09:12.421 --> 09:14.641
Thank you for letting me
be a part of your story.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.906
Even if it was only
for a little while.

09:21.125 --> 09:24.085
Yeah, something tells me
you're gonna create
your own stories.

09:39.317 --> 09:40.275
Lyla.

09:40.318 --> 09:41.406
The Crisis has begun.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.063
Cisco,
what have you got?

09:46.107 --> 09:49.153
Is this an isolated event?
Is it everywhere?

09:49.197 --> 09:51.068
-Cisco?

09:51.112 --> 09:52.200
Iris!

09:58.119 --> 10:00.687
-Lyla?
-I'm Harbinger now.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.515
I'm working with the Monitor.

10:04.473 --> 10:06.693
He sent you to get me?

10:06.736 --> 10:09.086
-Because the Crisis is here?
-That is correct.

10:11.698 --> 10:12.873
I'm ready.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.401
Turning our
attention to local news,

10:19.444 --> 10:22.752
a series of robberies
by the Wonderland Gang
continues

10:22.796 --> 10:26.060
with seemingly no end
in sight...

10:31.456 --> 10:32.283
Where is Alice?

11:02.270 --> 11:03.880
-I said, "Where is Alice?"

11:03.924 --> 11:06.230
Okay... okay, I'll tell you.

11:07.579 --> 11:10.017
-There's an old sugar factory.
-Where is it?

11:14.543 --> 11:18.199
Batwoman, the multi-verse
is in great danger.
You are needed.

11:18.242 --> 11:19.983
I'll deal with,
whatever your crazy is,
in a minute.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.681
There is no more time.

11:26.729 --> 11:30.690
Okay, folks, time for
our tie-breaker question
of the night. Here we go.

11:30.733 --> 11:34.694
What is the name
of the last song
Janis Joplin ever recorded?

11:34.737 --> 11:36.608
Ready for some free drinks?

11:36.652 --> 11:40.482
And the answer to our final
bonus question is...

11:40.525 --> 11:41.744
"Little Robot Man."

11:41.788 --> 11:43.920
The strange visitors
are the winners tonight.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.008
Better luck next time, legends.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.662
Uh, no, that's wrong.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.186
But "Mercedes Benz"
was Janis Joplin's last song.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.275
I'm gonna tell
that trivia host.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.407
Sara.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.583
So, you remember
last year at Woodstock

11:54.626 --> 11:57.586
when I was supposed to steal
a lock of Janis Joplin's hair
without her noticing?

11:57.629 --> 12:00.241
-Yeah?
-Uh, she noticed.

12:00.284 --> 12:03.287
-Then she called me--
-"Little Robot Man."

12:03.331 --> 12:05.942
Well, congratulations,
you change history

12:05.986 --> 12:07.988
and lost us trivia night.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.775
Oh, and we're done here.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.561
Lyla? What's with the suit?

12:17.693 --> 12:18.955
Panic is rising out there.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.957
I want every available agent
in the field

12:21.001 --> 12:23.177
until we get a handle
on whatever this thing is.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.490
Hey! Face down
on the floor. Now!

12:32.534 --> 12:35.755
Did you do this?
Did you destroy Argo?

12:43.110 --> 12:44.894
Oh, my God, you're okay.

12:44.938 --> 12:47.723
Thanks to her. She appeared
at the last second
and brought us here.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.683
We sent Jonathan off
in an escape pod.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.251
And my mother?

12:56.558 --> 12:57.646
I'm so sorry, Kara.

13:02.564 --> 13:03.957
Kara?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.697
Where are we?
And what just happened?

13:05.741 --> 13:07.525
-Um--
-You're on Earth-38.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.180
-There was--

13:11.225 --> 13:12.922
That rabbit was about to talk.

13:12.966 --> 13:15.011
This one speaks to rabbits.

13:15.055 --> 13:18.101
It's okay. 'Cause we're all
on the same side.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.538
Are we?
'Cause I don't know them.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.105
But you know me.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.107
And if you were brought here
with all these other heroes,

13:24.151 --> 13:26.153
it's probably because
we need you.

13:26.196 --> 13:28.633
I trust everyone
in this room
with my life.

13:29.286 --> 13:30.461
Including you.

13:37.425 --> 13:40.428
Well, I guess you should all
just call me Kate.

13:40.471 --> 13:43.431
Yeah, yeah, that makes
a lot of sense.

13:45.128 --> 13:47.827
Uh, I'm Mia.
I'm Oliver's daughter.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.437
I never knew he had a daughter.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.612
He gets that a lot.

13:50.655 --> 13:51.831
Hmm...

13:51.874 --> 13:54.529
Okay, you. Start talking.

13:54.572 --> 13:58.838
There's a wave
of anti-matter sweeping
across this universe,

13:58.881 --> 14:00.578
destroying everything
in its path.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.798
I've seen the anti-matter wave
in action.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.149
It wiped all of Earth-2
right out of existence.

14:06.193 --> 14:08.456
I brought you all
to Earth-38 because
this is where

14:08.499 --> 14:10.414
the Monitor wants you
to make your stand.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.416
This universe
is the tipping point.

14:12.460 --> 14:15.332
If we don't stop
the anti-matter wave here,

14:15.376 --> 14:17.944
it will continue
to the next universe,

14:17.987 --> 14:20.598
and the next, and the next.

14:20.642 --> 14:25.952
Until it has obliterated,
not only every Earth,
but every thing...

14:25.995 --> 14:27.301
across all reality.

14:27.344 --> 14:29.651
Right. So, we are going to
need a bigger team.

14:30.521 --> 14:32.567
Where's Barry?
Where are the legends?

14:32.610 --> 14:34.047
Doing reconnaissance.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.875
I'm headed
to check on them now.

14:39.182 --> 14:40.357
I still don't like her.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.098
Well, Brainy's algorithm
will help forecast

14:42.142 --> 14:45.101
exactly how much time we have
until the anti-matter wave
hits.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.494
Thank you all for being here.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.800
I know we can
beat this together.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.759
About Jonathan...

14:50.802 --> 14:53.980
we set a course for Earth
in his pod, but we don't know
where it landed.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.938
Or even if it landed.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.636
Brainy, can you track
his trajectory?

14:58.680 --> 15:00.029
Absolutely.

15:00.073 --> 15:02.031
We'll find that bouncing bundle
of Kryptonian joy

15:02.075 --> 15:04.294
-faster than
a flying Flackurian--

15:17.699 --> 15:19.135
This is a new problem.

15:19.179 --> 15:20.354
I can handle it.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.445
Wait, the tower
isn't a threat.

15:24.488 --> 15:25.968
How do you know?

15:26.012 --> 15:27.709
It's a quantum tower,
apparently.

15:27.752 --> 15:30.538
And it's the only thing
that can save the people
of this world.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.241
At the dawn of time,

15:38.285 --> 15:40.896
the Monitor placed
quantum towers
on key Earths

15:40.940 --> 15:43.333
as a last line of defense.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.683
The red skies are dissipating,
which means it's working.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.598
From this design,
it looks like
the tower is capable

15:47.642 --> 15:49.774
of generating
a quantum flux field,

15:49.818 --> 15:53.256
-which can, theoretically--
-Reverse the exogenic state
of the anti-matter wave,

15:53.300 --> 15:55.476
thereby dissipating
the anti-matter energy.

15:55.519 --> 15:58.000
Yes. Finally, someone
who speaks my language.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.393
Love your suit.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.612
If you want, I can probably
give it an upgrade.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.005
Depends on how attached you are
to your hand.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.615
Pretty attached.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.574
So the tower can stop
this Earth from
being destroyed?

16:06.617 --> 16:07.792
If you can protect it.

16:07.836 --> 16:10.273
-Protect it from what?
-The Anti-Monitor.

16:10.317 --> 16:13.102
He commands forces
greater than any army.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.148
When the tower stops the wave,

16:15.191 --> 16:19.543
they will come to thwart
any effort to save this planet
and its people.

16:19.587 --> 16:21.502
Sprock!

16:21.545 --> 16:24.461
Jonathan's pod
has disappeared
from our radar.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.463
It appears to have been
sucked into a wormhole.

16:26.507 --> 16:29.031
-What are the co-ordinates?
-Star City. Earth-16.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.815
Interesting.

16:30.859 --> 16:34.254
It must've been
a temporal wormhole because...

16:34.297 --> 16:37.300
well, the pod
is in the year 2046.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.823
We've been there before.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.651
Apparently, we didn't
just travel to the future.

16:40.695 --> 16:44.133
Yeah, we traveled
to a parallel Earth
in the future. That's great.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.788
-I'm going after him.
-Clark, you can't.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.096
Those are two words
I'm not used to hearing
and my son needs me.

16:50.139 --> 16:52.272
I'm a parent and I get it.

16:53.838 --> 16:56.276
The entire universe needs you.

16:56.319 --> 16:58.017
When that tower gets attacked,

16:58.060 --> 16:59.670
you have to be here
to protect it.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.585
I'll go.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.022
Lois...

17:03.065 --> 17:04.458
I'll back you up.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.589
-I know the terrain.
- As will I.

17:06.634 --> 17:09.028
I happen to be excellent
with children.

17:11.290 --> 17:12.988
Don't worry, I'll get him.

17:13.771 --> 17:14.685
I love you.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.645
You know, Oliver...

17:18.166 --> 17:20.256
I've seen playboy Oliver,

17:20.300 --> 17:21.910
vigilante Oliver,

17:21.953 --> 17:24.868
but I never thought
I would see parent Oliver.

17:24.913 --> 17:28.263
-It's weird, right?
-So weird.

17:28.308 --> 17:30.266
But... it looks good on you.

17:33.574 --> 17:36.968
Uh, J'onn, I thought
Director Danvers was with you.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.796
She was.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.320
But she went to call
the president to co-ordinate
the evacuation,

17:40.363 --> 17:42.191
in case
the quantum tower fails.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.759
She is smart, that is exactly
what I was about to suggest,

17:44.802 --> 17:46.761
but has she contemplated
the number of ships

17:46.804 --> 17:48.806
one would require
for such an exodus?

17:48.850 --> 17:53.115
Brainy, every alien refugee
on this planet came here
on a ship.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.899
I intend to ask them
for their help.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.727
Do you really think they will?

17:56.771 --> 17:58.599
After how the government
treated them last year.

17:58.642 --> 18:02.168
I have faith that...
everybody will do
the right thing.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.213
Humans and aliens alike.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.172
Well, in any event...

18:07.173 --> 18:08.130
this should help.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.530
Oh, Sprock.

18:16.573 --> 18:20.186
I just managed
to zero in on Jonathan's
location in Star City.

18:25.582 --> 18:28.803
The president is in.
He's speaking
with other world leaders.

18:28.846 --> 18:31.197
We'll co-ordinate
the effort from National City.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.416
But J'onn...

18:33.460 --> 18:36.115
even if we did manage
to get enough ships
for everyone,

18:36.158 --> 18:38.160
we can't just fly off Earth.

18:38.204 --> 18:41.207
I mean, space itself
is being erased.

18:41.250 --> 18:44.166
Earth-1 is the last stop
on the anti-matter trajectory.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.255
We can try
and get everybody there.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.997
Well, one little extrapolator
is not gonna do the job.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.304
The transmatter portal?

18:51.347 --> 18:53.175
Who could build one big enough?

18:53.219 --> 18:54.655
I mean, not even Brainy has.

18:55.612 --> 18:56.787
Lena.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.833
She built an enormous one
for the daxamites.

18:58.876 --> 19:01.357
-I'm sure she could
build one twice as big.
-No, that's too big of a risk.

19:01.401 --> 19:04.317
I mean, after Myriad,
after everything...

19:04.360 --> 19:06.145
she can't be trusted.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.842
What other choice do we have?

19:23.423 --> 19:24.902
I'm sorry about your mom.

19:27.296 --> 19:28.819
I couldn't save her.

19:28.863 --> 19:32.127
You had no powers on Argo.
There was nothing you could do.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.650
I feel like a fool.

19:33.694 --> 19:36.218
I thought I could
give up the cape and just...

19:37.263 --> 19:39.221
have everything
I ever wanted.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.399
And now, Argo is gone,

19:43.443 --> 19:44.574
this Earth is in danger,

19:44.618 --> 19:46.620
Lois and Jonathan
are out in the universe,

19:47.403 --> 19:48.535
where I can't protect them.

19:49.666 --> 19:52.408
And part of me can't help
thinking that...

19:55.368 --> 19:57.674
that I deserve this...

19:57.718 --> 20:00.155
for thinking that
I could have so much.

20:03.376 --> 20:04.638
That anyone could.

20:07.902 --> 20:08.990
I get it.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.559
I've been thinking that
a lot, too, lately.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.517
How I can never do enough.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.305
How my mistakes outweigh
all the good I've ever done.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.745
But it's not true.

20:26.703 --> 20:27.661
It can't be.

20:29.053 --> 20:30.403
And we're going to save them.

20:30.446 --> 20:34.058
Lois, Jonathan,
this whole planet.

20:34.102 --> 20:37.323
We've done it a dozen times
and we're going to do it again.

20:37.366 --> 20:41.544
How are you so...
hopeful right now?

20:41.588 --> 20:43.938
You've lost
just as much as I have today.

20:43.981 --> 20:46.157
Argo, your mom...

20:49.552 --> 20:51.728
Before our parents
sent us to Earth...

20:52.599 --> 20:54.818
nobody here knew
about Krypton.

20:56.472 --> 21:01.390
Now, there are stories,
celebrations,
museum exhibits.

21:01.434 --> 21:05.351
Just like you shared
our home with your family,

21:05.394 --> 21:07.962
we shared our home
with this whole world.

21:10.443 --> 21:13.359
Krypton's not just a place,
it's a spirit.

21:15.012 --> 21:18.102
It's hope. It's sacrifice.

21:20.844 --> 21:23.107
It's what our parents
did for us.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.763
What you did for Jonathan.

21:28.461 --> 21:31.725
We have made our parents proud
by fighting for what's right.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.556
So, we have to keep fighting.

21:36.599 --> 21:39.341
And as long as
that spirit is alive,

21:39.385 --> 21:41.343
Krypton will never die.

21:52.398 --> 21:55.444
-You wanted to see me?
-I did.

21:55.488 --> 21:56.924
I have something for you.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.231
What is it?

22:00.275 --> 22:01.494
Only one way to find out.

22:05.193 --> 22:07.456
Okay, please tell me
you're planning on
wearing this.

22:08.675 --> 22:11.721
I don't think that
that one would fit me.

22:13.941 --> 22:16.117
There should always be
at least one Green Arrow.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.294
Dad, I can't.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.818
You know, Mia, the Monitor
has taken a lot from me.

22:23.429 --> 22:27.041
But I will always
be grateful for the time
he has given me with you.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.522
If you're not gonna wear this,
no one should.

22:29.565 --> 22:30.784
You earned it.

22:33.700 --> 22:36.529
Just try it on, okay?
I gotta find Barry.

22:42.578 --> 22:45.712
The fastest man alive
shows up late to the Crisis
we've been expecting for years.

22:45.755 --> 22:48.105
-Ugh...
-It's not the...
it's not the best look, Barry.

22:48.149 --> 22:50.543
Lyla had us doing some recon
of the quantum towers.

22:50.586 --> 22:54.285
But listen, do you remember
the newspaper article
I showed you on the time vault?

22:54.329 --> 22:56.026
Red skies and a "crisis"?

22:56.070 --> 23:00.814
Okay, well, the Monitor
confirmed the papers
had lied and...

23:01.597 --> 23:04.992
in this Crisis,
I'm supposed to die.

23:05.471 --> 23:06.515
-No.
-No?

23:06.559 --> 23:08.125
We need to talk. Now!

23:08.604 --> 23:09.910
Who're you talking to?

23:09.953 --> 23:11.302
Hey, right now!

23:18.135 --> 23:20.703
We are past the time
for discussion, Oliver.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.705
You and I had an agreement.

23:24.011 --> 23:25.404
I die.

23:25.447 --> 23:28.668
Barry and Kara live!

23:28.711 --> 23:31.497
Yes... to keep
the cosmic balance.

23:32.672 --> 23:35.936
So, why are you telling Barry
that he's gonna die?

23:35.979 --> 23:40.462
I spared your friends' lives
so they could save
their world last year.

23:41.724 --> 23:44.727
This... is a very
different threat.

23:44.771 --> 23:47.121
You need to
stop playing games with me.

23:47.164 --> 23:50.037
You tell me
why the Anti-Monitor
is doing this.

23:52.692 --> 23:55.129
And then tell me
how I'm going to prevent it.

23:55.172 --> 23:57.044
Not knowing
what you're fighting means

23:57.087 --> 24:00.090
you will prepare
for every possibility.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.353
Because this threat
brings with it

24:02.397 --> 24:05.052
the annihilation of all life

24:05.095 --> 24:06.706
in all realities.

24:08.011 --> 24:10.840
Do you now comprehend
the scope...

24:10.884 --> 24:13.582
of the danger we all now face?

24:30.120 --> 24:32.035
Are you here to arrest me
during the apocalypse,

24:32.079 --> 24:34.777
or to try and kill me
because you weren't successful
the other day?

24:34.821 --> 24:37.127
I wasn't trying
to hurt you, Lena.

24:37.171 --> 24:39.129
I was trying to stop you
from using Myriad.

24:39.173 --> 24:42.829
Right. Is that why you had
a Claymore satellite
aimed at me?

24:42.872 --> 24:45.005
And I didn't use Myriad,
that was Eve Tessmacher.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.268
You and I both know
that that isn't true.

24:49.575 --> 24:53.013
The reason the sky is red,
and the planet feels like
it's falling apart

24:53.056 --> 24:55.102
is because it is.

24:55.145 --> 24:57.017
There is an anti-matter wave
that is tearing through
the universe right now,

24:57.060 --> 25:01.108
and it will destroy Earth
if Kara and the other heroes
don't stop it.

25:01.151 --> 25:04.720
Now, I am working with J'onn
to hedge our bets
and mount an evacuation,

25:04.764 --> 25:06.374
but in order to do that...

25:07.331 --> 25:08.637
we need your help.

25:09.769 --> 25:12.119
Look, I am sorry
that I lied to you.

25:12.162 --> 25:15.470
And not just me,
and not just Kara...

25:16.602 --> 25:18.212
it was all of us.

25:18.255 --> 25:22.172
J'onn and Brainy and Nia.

25:22.216 --> 25:24.740
You know, you actually
had me believe
that you hated Supergirl.

25:24.784 --> 25:26.568
I wasn't pretending about that.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.832
And that is a... long story.

25:31.878 --> 25:35.011
Listen, I-- I know
that you feel burned by us.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.665
And that there is nothing
that I can say

25:36.709 --> 25:39.363
in this moment
that is going to change that.

25:39.407 --> 25:44.412
But if you could please
just put your feelings aside,

25:44.455 --> 25:48.329
J'onn and I really, really,
need your help.

25:59.645 --> 26:02.082
I don't want
your apology, Alex.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.693
'Cause you will never again
have my friendship or my trust.

26:04.737 --> 26:06.608
I have learned my lesson
from all of you.

26:06.652 --> 26:10.743
But if the world is at stake,
then of course, I'll help.

26:10.786 --> 26:12.788
It is hubris of you
to think that I wouldn't,

26:12.832 --> 26:15.269
but then, you've made it
perfectly clear

26:15.312 --> 26:17.967
how little you've thought of me
these last few years, so...

26:19.012 --> 26:20.622
what do you need me to do?

26:22.015 --> 26:23.973
Whatever
is inside there,
it's working.

26:24.017 --> 26:27.020
The anti-matter wave
has stopped
and it's slowly dissipating.

26:27.063 --> 26:29.631
How do we protect that thing
from an enemy we know
nothing about,

26:29.675 --> 26:30.632
but we know is coming?

26:30.676 --> 26:32.242
We head inside...

26:32.939 --> 26:34.723
stake out strategic positions.

26:34.767 --> 26:36.725
If we're fortified,
we control the battle.

26:41.295 --> 26:43.819
Earthquake that magnitude
could overwhelm
the entire coast.

26:43.863 --> 26:46.517
Go. Help contain the damage.

26:46.561 --> 26:47.736
Go! We got this.

26:50.783 --> 26:52.523
Let's go inside and dig in.

26:56.963 --> 26:59.313
You've gotta be
kidding me.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.924
What are the odds
that my son's pod landed here?

27:01.968 --> 27:05.536
Three billion, eight hundred
and twenty seven million
to one.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.887
Uh... but the pod
didn't land here.

27:07.930 --> 27:10.237
But you said that
this is where Jonathan is.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.413
Yes. This is where
I tracked him.

27:12.456 --> 27:16.112
But I can't speculate
as to why Oliver Queen
would kidnap a baby.

27:16.156 --> 27:18.114
Well, he probably thought
he was rescuing him.

27:18.158 --> 27:20.464
I mean, Star City is no place
for a child.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.336
Well, I'll thank him
when I have Jonathan back.

27:22.379 --> 27:24.338
-In the meantime,
we should split up--

27:25.600 --> 27:26.732
This is unnecessary.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.215
Oliver?

27:33.521 --> 27:34.740
Oliver.

27:40.441 --> 27:42.138
Jonathan!

27:42.182 --> 27:45.098
Yes. Yes, you go get Jonathan.
I'll...
I'll stay here,

28:00.026 --> 28:02.332
What? No.

28:02.376 --> 28:03.769
No, it's not possible.

28:04.465 --> 28:05.988
You're dead.

28:06.032 --> 28:07.468
You...

28:08.817 --> 28:10.036
you went down with the Gambit.

28:11.559 --> 28:13.909
But I came back. Remember?

28:13.953 --> 28:15.389
I found you in Lian Yu.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.001
I must be losing my mind.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.090
-No, Ollie, you're not--
-Hey.

28:22.135 --> 28:26.095
You're not. You're...
It's just a long story.

28:27.967 --> 28:29.359
The longest.

28:35.278 --> 28:36.192
Thank you, Oliver.

28:38.891 --> 28:40.806
Thank you for helping my baby.

28:48.509 --> 28:49.771
So, what is this?

28:49.815 --> 28:51.860
The proverbial calm
before the storm?

28:51.904 --> 28:53.383
Something like that.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.822
Remember, Mia,
whatever happens...

28:57.474 --> 28:58.606
find your mother.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.175
Tell her how much I love her.

29:09.704 --> 29:10.661
Okay.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.621
When Lyla said an army,

29:13.664 --> 29:16.493
I thought
she meant an... army.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.887
She did. It's just that...

29:18.931 --> 29:21.020
we've never faced
one like this before.

29:31.117 --> 29:34.337
"One army." She said,
"One army." It's more like ten!

29:37.036 --> 29:38.994
-Very nice.
-Learned from the best.

29:39.038 --> 29:41.040
-Take cover!

29:45.261 --> 29:46.785
They're trying
to breach the tower.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.308
Well, we can't let that happen!

29:49.091 --> 29:50.832
I'll take that upgrade now.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.921
Oh, uh, if I can have
one of those without
losing an appendage.

29:52.965 --> 29:55.794
-Mmm-hmm.
-Oh, so cool!

29:55.837 --> 29:57.273
Incredibly balanced.
Carbon fiber?

29:57.317 --> 29:58.884
-Your friend talks a lot.
-Yeah, you get used to it.

29:58.927 --> 30:00.537
Hey, Ray, focus!

30:00.581 --> 30:02.452
Focusing.

30:02.496 --> 30:04.237
Now, if we can just charge
your Batarang with
my compressed light energy.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.412
Incoming!

30:16.597 --> 30:17.424
Not bad.

30:27.042 --> 30:27.869
Dad!

30:41.100 --> 30:42.753
There's too many of them.

30:46.583 --> 30:47.933
You want some help?

30:47.976 --> 30:49.978
There's no need for panic.

30:50.022 --> 30:53.634
Supergirl and Superman
are working hard
to save this planet.

30:53.677 --> 30:56.332
Soon, alien ships will begin
circling the globe,

30:56.376 --> 30:59.031
picking people up
and taking you to safety.

30:59.074 --> 30:59.988
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:00.032 --> 31:01.163
Did Alex get Lena on board?

31:01.207 --> 31:02.469
Yeah, they're working on
the portal now.

31:02.512 --> 31:04.601
I just hope
J'onn can get enough ships.

31:04.645 --> 31:07.169
There are literally
billions of people
to get off the planet.

31:07.213 --> 31:08.910
That's why Brainy left J'onn
his keys.

31:08.954 --> 31:10.869
Keys to what?

31:13.959 --> 31:15.047
The Legion left it here.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.312
Right on time, J'onn.

31:19.355 --> 31:21.053
Are you ready
to get this evacuation
underway?

31:21.096 --> 31:23.620
Start getting people
into groups and I'll start
beaming them up.

31:23.664 --> 31:26.145
Let's just hope Alex and Lena
get that portal on in time

31:26.188 --> 31:27.973
so we have somewhere to go.

31:28.016 --> 31:29.757
-Go ahead. This way.
-All right, people,
let's get in to the ship.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.629
The quantum tower
is keeping the wave at bay.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.153
Supergirl is...

31:34.196 --> 31:35.676
fighting really hard
to protect it,

31:35.719 --> 31:37.243
but we've got to get
this portal up and running.

31:37.286 --> 31:38.940
I'm trying!
But the transmatter portal

31:38.984 --> 31:41.116
works by synthesizing
polyelectronic anions.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.335
And if I don't get
the energy levels right

31:42.378 --> 31:44.119
when I interface
with the breach device,

31:44.163 --> 31:45.642
then the ships
will disintegrate
when they fly right through it.

31:45.686 --> 31:48.515
-Right. That is not
a good option.
-No.

31:48.558 --> 31:50.430
Have you thought about
using an inverse variable

31:50.473 --> 31:52.345
to help calculate
the differential?

31:53.041 --> 31:54.260
Galleon's theory.

31:54.303 --> 31:56.131
That's smart.
An inverse beta-decay

31:56.175 --> 31:58.742
to figure constituent quark,
that could work.

32:05.358 --> 32:06.794
Thanks.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.361
Yeah, um... just...

32:08.404 --> 32:10.885
keep working.
I've got your back.

32:14.019 --> 32:15.629
I never thought
I'd see you again.

32:16.630 --> 32:19.328
One of the benefits
of parallel Earths.

32:20.199 --> 32:23.593
Parallel Earths?

32:23.637 --> 32:28.642
It would appear that
your reality is a little...
stranger than mine.

32:28.685 --> 32:30.383
You really have no idea.

32:32.907 --> 32:34.343
All my life...

32:37.129 --> 32:39.522
I just wanted to...

32:39.566 --> 32:42.699
to apologize
for bringing you
on that boat.

32:44.136 --> 32:46.094
But you aren't even you.

32:46.703 --> 32:48.009
Ollie.

32:49.489 --> 32:53.014
If your me was anything
like I was,

32:53.058 --> 32:56.104
then getting on the Gambit
with you was her choice.

32:56.148 --> 32:58.280
And in my world, that trip...

32:58.324 --> 33:01.414
it set off
a whole series of events

33:01.457 --> 33:04.199
that neither you or I
could've ever dreamed of.

33:05.940 --> 33:08.073
You became a hero,

33:08.116 --> 33:10.814
a husband, a father.

33:13.252 --> 33:15.950
And I'm flying through time
happier than I've ever been.

33:17.604 --> 33:20.128
And none of that
would've ever happened

33:20.172 --> 33:22.087
if I didn't get on
that boat with you.

33:24.524 --> 33:25.960
It was destiny.

33:28.093 --> 33:30.834
I'm... sorry to break up
what I'm sure must be

33:30.878 --> 33:34.099
the strangest reunion
in the history of the world,

33:34.142 --> 33:36.797
but, um,
if we don't leave now,

33:36.840 --> 33:40.975
I'm afraid our extrapolator
might not have enough power
for us to return home.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.282
Wait, what's an extrapolator?

33:43.325 --> 33:44.457
It's another long story.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.506
You're a good man...

33:51.551 --> 33:52.639
on every Earth.

34:06.218 --> 34:08.089
-Is that it?
-Like that was easy?

34:08.132 --> 34:09.612
They're on the roof.

34:15.835 --> 34:17.402
What's happening out there?

34:17.446 --> 34:19.840
The skies are red again, the anti-matter wave's moving,

34:19.882 --> 34:21.362
and the portal isn't open yet.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.016
-There's more
shadow demons incoming.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.933
Kara, Clark, get to the roof.

34:25.976 --> 34:28.196
Get the tower operational
again. We'll stay behind
and hold them off.

34:34.376 --> 34:36.335
Are those solar panels?

34:36.378 --> 34:38.119
Looks close enough.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.947
We won't be able
to power it definitely.

34:39.989 --> 34:42.210
We just need to buy more time.

34:42.254 --> 34:45.170
We might lose
the planet, but we can
still save the people.

34:52.045 --> 34:53.830
You almost got it?

34:53.873 --> 34:55.049
Almost done, I think.

34:55.876 --> 34:57.704
Yes! Systems are a go.

34:57.747 --> 35:01.011
Calculating destination...
destination set.

35:03.405 --> 35:04.928
Smart call
with Galleon's theory.

35:04.972 --> 35:07.714
Oh, lucky guess. But you're
the real genius here, so...

35:08.802 --> 35:11.239
Don't mistake us
working together
for friendship.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.762
I told you before,

35:12.806 --> 35:15.243
Kara and you showed me
who you were and I accept that.

35:17.245 --> 35:19.552
Now, let's go help people
get on these ships.

35:44.011 --> 35:45.969
-That was too close
for comfort.

35:46.535 --> 35:48.233
Always gotta one-up me, huh?

35:48.276 --> 35:49.669
-Did it work?
-You did it.

35:49.712 --> 35:51.540
The tower is working again
and the portal is open.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.542
Uh, but the ships
better be fast.

35:53.586 --> 35:56.458
The Supers' charge didn't
actually stop the wave,
it just slowed it down.

35:56.502 --> 35:58.243
According to
Brainy's algorithm,
we have 14 minutes

35:58.286 --> 35:59.809
before it makes contact
with Earth.

35:59.853 --> 36:01.811
Well, then
we better make
every minute count.

36:01.855 --> 36:04.031
We've got your back.

36:04.074 --> 36:07.469
We need to keep those
shadow demons at bay until
every last ship gets through--

36:17.436 --> 36:18.611
All right, get to the ships!

36:18.654 --> 36:20.352
Keep your eyes open
for debris, people!

36:20.395 --> 36:22.136
Keep it orderly, people.
Come on.

36:29.448 --> 36:30.927
James left it for me.

36:50.425 --> 36:52.122
The battle is lost!

36:52.166 --> 36:55.778
We must retreat
and save our resources
for battles yet to come.

37:11.359 --> 37:12.882
Oliver! Oli--

37:14.101 --> 37:16.408
Oliver! It is time!

37:16.451 --> 37:17.931
Has the planet been
evacuated yet?

37:17.974 --> 37:19.019
Not entirely.

37:19.889 --> 37:21.021
Then it's not time.

38:24.127 --> 38:25.781
Oliver.

38:25.825 --> 38:27.783
He fought to his last breath.

38:27.827 --> 38:30.699
Knowing every moment
was another life saved.

38:30.743 --> 38:33.049
-Saved?
-Your universe is no more.

38:33.093 --> 38:35.922
Of 7.53 billion...

38:35.965 --> 38:39.012
three billion souls
made it to Earth-1

38:39.055 --> 38:40.840
on the armada of ships.

38:40.883 --> 38:45.584
I calculate one billion souls
survived due to
his noble sacrifice.

38:54.767 --> 38:56.551
Nash?

38:56.595 --> 38:57.813
Once upon a time.
Not anymore.

38:57.857 --> 39:00.773
Now, I'm simply a man
serving his penance.

39:01.513 --> 39:03.166
Penance for what?

39:03.210 --> 39:06.561
I freed the Anti-Monitor
from his confinement only...

39:07.432 --> 39:10.304
to become a... Pariah.

39:11.610 --> 39:13.786
Sentenced to bear witness
to his actions.

39:18.617 --> 39:19.879
Oliver!

39:21.184 --> 39:23.491
It's okay, Sara.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.190
This is my destiny.

39:27.234 --> 39:28.366
-Oliver.
-Barry?

39:29.454 --> 39:33.196
You, my friend...

39:33.240 --> 39:35.155
are the very best of us.

39:36.635 --> 39:39.072
I gave it all up...

39:40.203 --> 39:41.640
for you and Kara.

39:43.468 --> 39:44.512
What-- What do you mean?

39:44.556 --> 39:46.514
I need the two of you to...

39:48.473 --> 39:49.648
be the one to...

39:50.692 --> 39:52.172
to save us now.

39:56.002 --> 39:56.829
Mia...

39:57.482 --> 39:58.483
Dad.

39:59.919 --> 40:01.921
Don't forget
to find your mother.

40:02.704 --> 40:03.531
Okay.

40:04.663 --> 40:06.273
Find William.

40:08.536 --> 40:10.320
Tell him how much I love him.

40:13.106 --> 40:14.673
I love you, Mia.

40:16.675 --> 40:19.286
You keep me
in your heart, okay?

40:20.635 --> 40:22.202
-Dad...
-Okay?

40:39.698 --> 40:42.657
It was
not supposed to be like this.

40:42.701 --> 40:45.051
This is not his ending
I foresaw.

40:46.922 --> 40:50.317
Things are turning out
differently than I expected.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.232
But one thing is certain.

40:53.755 --> 40:55.583
Everything we know...

40:56.671 --> 40:58.630
everything there is...

40:58.673 --> 41:00.806
and everything
there ever was...

41:04.113 --> 41:05.898
is doomed.
