00:00.244 --> 00:01.680
Colin Robinson for

00:01.747 --> 00:04.887
Staten Island Comptroller
headquarters.

00:04.953 --> 00:07.759
Sean had to bow out of the race.

00:07.826 --> 00:10.197
Apparently, in Staten Island,

00:10.264 --> 00:12.903
there's a rule that a candidate
can't have more than

00:12.969 --> 00:14.272
nine DUIs.

00:14.338 --> 00:16.644
Most Staten Island
office holders

00:16.710 --> 00:18.146
only have two or three.

00:18.213 --> 00:19.583
Oh, hi, Barbara.

00:19.650 --> 00:20.818
[Colin]
He needed someone

00:20.885 --> 00:22.789
to take his place, and my record

00:22.856 --> 00:25.394
is absolutely, completely clean.

00:25.460 --> 00:29.302
Yo. Robby Robinson,
get over here.

00:29.368 --> 00:30.939
You're on the tube. Quick.

00:31.005 --> 00:32.542
[Barbara] With all due respect,
my new opponent

00:32.609 --> 00:34.580
seems like a nice man,
but he has

00:34.646 --> 00:37.586
no government experience.
He was working as a server...

00:37.652 --> 00:40.692
I can't wait to flex
my blue collar bona fides

00:40.758 --> 00:41.794
on the debate stage.

00:41.860 --> 00:44.633
[laughs] Up top.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.570
There it is.

[Nandor]
I have been spending more time

01:24.078 --> 01:25.581
at this new gym lately.

01:25.648 --> 01:27.284
I have asked Guillermo
to join me,

01:27.351 --> 01:29.723
but he always seems
to have something else

01:29.790 --> 01:31.392
going on these days.

01:31.459 --> 01:32.896
Guillermo! Guillermo,

01:32.963 --> 01:35.000
-where are you?
-Shit!

01:35.067 --> 01:37.071
-[Guillermo] I've been
avoiding Nandor.
-Oh.

01:37.137 --> 01:38.340
[Guillermo] It's been hard,

01:38.406 --> 01:40.110
physically and emotionally.

01:40.177 --> 01:41.379
-Guillermo?
-[Guillermo] I just don't

01:41.446 --> 01:42.816
want him
to get suspicious that

01:42.882 --> 01:44.385
-I'm a vampire now. Or half
-[exclaims]

01:44.452 --> 01:46.523
a vampire. Or whatever I am.

01:46.590 --> 01:47.959
-[sighs]
-[Nandor] Guillermo?

01:48.026 --> 01:49.963
[Nandor]
And so I have decided

01:50.030 --> 01:52.969
to hunt for a new companion.

01:53.036 --> 01:55.173
Need a spot?

01:55.240 --> 01:57.011
Uh, sure, why not?

01:57.077 --> 01:58.748
Great.

01:58.814 --> 02:01.587
Looks like it's just me and you
in here tonight, huh, buddy?

02:01.654 --> 02:03.189
Um, yeah.

02:03.256 --> 02:06.362
Uh, it's usually pretty empty
on Easter Sunday.

02:06.429 --> 02:10.103
I guess all the gentiles
are out hunting for eggs.

02:10.170 --> 02:13.009
You are Jewish?

02:13.076 --> 02:14.478
Yep.

02:14.546 --> 02:16.583
Very cool.

02:16.650 --> 02:17.786
Mm-hmm.

02:19.255 --> 02:21.860
Alexander.

02:21.927 --> 02:23.096
Nandor.

02:23.163 --> 02:25.702
Thanks for the spot, pal.

02:25.768 --> 02:28.273
It was my pleasure.

02:28.340 --> 02:31.914
So, what meshuggaas--

02:31.980 --> 02:33.383
that means stuff--

02:33.450 --> 02:35.387
is everyone doing tonight?

02:35.454 --> 02:36.957
If you're only asking us
what we're doing

02:37.024 --> 02:39.295
so you can tell us what
you're doing, we don't care.

02:39.362 --> 02:42.267
Relax, I'm just kibitzing.
Besides,

02:42.334 --> 02:44.973
I have acquired a new friend.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.645
-[Laszlo] Oh.
-[Nandor] And now we are
going to the movies

02:47.712 --> 02:49.015
together.

02:49.081 --> 02:51.052
We are mishpocha.

02:51.119 --> 02:52.421
Oh, yes.

02:52.488 --> 02:54.960
My new friend--
he's the total package.

02:55.027 --> 02:57.832
Has a great sense of humor,
loves to work out

02:57.899 --> 03:00.003
and he's Jewish.

03:00.070 --> 03:02.207
What difference
does it make if he's Jewish?

03:02.274 --> 03:04.211
It doesn't,
but back in Al Qolnidar,

03:04.278 --> 03:06.683
I always heard stories
about the Jews.

03:06.750 --> 03:09.689
Exceptionally proud people,
fierce warriors,

03:09.756 --> 03:11.593
but I never actually
got to meet one.

03:11.660 --> 03:14.465
I had no idea there were Jews
in New York City.

03:14.533 --> 03:18.440
And now I am proud
to call one my friend.

03:18.507 --> 03:20.377
Oh. That's great.
What-What's his name?

03:20.444 --> 03:21.780
Well, look who
suddenly reappeared

03:21.847 --> 03:23.918
now that I'm kvelling
about my new friend.

03:23.984 --> 03:26.122
-I've been here the whole time.
-[Nandor] Well, if you must
know,

03:26.189 --> 03:27.892
his name is Alexander.

03:27.959 --> 03:29.696
Alexander the Jew.

03:29.763 --> 03:31.365
Nope. I don't think
that's his name.

03:31.432 --> 03:32.936
[Nandor]
Quit your kvetching.

03:33.002 --> 03:34.606
[Colin]
I really

03:34.673 --> 03:37.111
couldn't care less
about being comptroller.

03:37.177 --> 03:40.217
Hello! I am Colin Robinson.

03:40.283 --> 03:42.254
I am running for comptroller.

03:42.321 --> 03:43.958
-Can she vote?
-Uh, no.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.327
-Okay, then don't.
-Ooh.

03:45.394 --> 03:46.497
I'd rather it lay on the ground

03:46.563 --> 03:47.532
than go into her hands.

03:47.599 --> 03:48.734
I'm only doing it

03:48.801 --> 03:50.705
because the debate stage

03:50.772 --> 03:52.809
is a great place
for a mega drain.

03:52.876 --> 03:55.782
You know, it's really
no surprise the amount

03:55.848 --> 03:58.721
-Uh, we're good.

03:58.788 --> 04:00.323
-[Sean] Colin, stop it.
-What are you running for?

04:00.390 --> 04:01.527
-Touch this.
-[Sean] What are you doing?

04:01.593 --> 04:02.762
-Touch it.
-[Sean] Stop doing that.

04:02.829 --> 04:04.833
[Colin]
But the perfect campaign

04:04.900 --> 04:06.135
needs the perfect wife.

04:06.202 --> 04:09.609
I have an old flame
that comes here.

04:09.676 --> 04:12.849
Once we accept that
they are never coming back

04:12.916 --> 04:15.187
to sweep us off our feet
with an unexpected...

04:15.253 --> 04:17.492
[Colin clears throat]

04:17.559 --> 04:19.963
E-Evie Russell?

04:20.030 --> 04:22.067
Colin Robinson.

04:22.134 --> 04:23.904
W-What are you doing here?

04:23.971 --> 04:26.309
Evie, please. I-I need you.

04:26.375 --> 04:28.480
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again

04:28.547 --> 04:31.252
after you fled the scene
of the accident

04:31.319 --> 04:33.624
that left me partially blind.

04:33.691 --> 04:36.462
-[group gasps]
-And completely unable
to move my legs.

04:36.530 --> 04:37.599
-[group murmurs]
-[man] Oh, Evie.

04:37.665 --> 04:39.335
[Colin]
Evie Russell

04:39.401 --> 04:41.707
is an emotional vampire.

04:41.773 --> 04:44.211
The doctor said,
"She'd be better off dead."

04:44.278 --> 04:48.019
[Colin]
She drains people
by feeding on their emotions.

04:48.086 --> 04:51.259
And then he hung himself
while he was masturbating.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.029
-[woman] Oh.
-[Colin] When we dated,

04:53.096 --> 04:56.503
she destroyed me
and fed off of the remnants

04:56.570 --> 04:59.208
of what used to be my heart.

04:59.275 --> 05:01.412
She's the best.

05:01.479 --> 05:03.818
Oh, I've never stopped
thinking about you.

05:03.884 --> 05:06.088
I mean, even after
all these years.

05:06.155 --> 05:09.228
To me, you are perfect.

05:09.295 --> 05:11.032
Love Actually, 2003.

05:11.098 --> 05:13.336
I wish I knew how to quit you.

05:13.403 --> 05:15.775
Brokeback Mountain, 2005.

05:15.842 --> 05:19.081
-I got you this necklace.
-[people gasp]

05:19.148 --> 05:21.587
Titanic, 1997.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.595
-It looks beautiful on you.
-[Evie] Thank you.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.587
[speaking Greek]

05:38.654 --> 05:40.525
[Nadja]
Ever since I stumbled on

05:40.591 --> 05:42.094
the neighborhood
of Little Antipaxos,

05:42.160 --> 05:45.300
I have been spending my nights
with a delightful family.

05:45.367 --> 05:46.603
No, I-I have eaten...

05:46.670 --> 05:48.239
Being with them makes me feel

05:48.306 --> 05:49.809
almost human.

05:49.876 --> 05:52.414
I've been helping my new family
by actually working.

05:52.481 --> 05:54.251
And maybe these simple acts

05:54.318 --> 05:57.090
of kindness, compassion,
and friendship

05:57.157 --> 05:58.594
might help lift this

05:58.661 --> 06:01.900
pissing Antipaxon curse
that I have all over me.

06:01.967 --> 06:04.171
But... [sighs]
they keep asking

06:04.238 --> 06:05.273
to meet Laszlo.

06:05.340 --> 06:07.244
Laszlo is not from Antipaxos,

06:07.311 --> 06:11.052
and Antipaxons
are very, very suspicious

06:11.118 --> 06:12.087
of outsiders.

06:12.154 --> 06:13.791
[men shouting]

06:13.857 --> 06:16.362
He's coming tonight.
[sighs]

06:16.429 --> 06:18.399
[Laszlo] Now you see,
what you must understand is

06:18.466 --> 06:20.070
courting a partner's

06:20.136 --> 06:22.942
family is just as important
as courting the lover.

06:23.009 --> 06:26.282
So, I have done
deep research into

06:26.349 --> 06:28.486
these simple island folk.

06:29.623 --> 06:33.096
I learned their customs,
their dress.

06:33.162 --> 06:34.365
What the fuck are you wearing?

06:34.431 --> 06:35.467
I'm dressed as an islander.

06:35.534 --> 06:36.703
These people are peasants.

06:36.770 --> 06:38.239
It's important I fit in,
my darling.

06:38.306 --> 06:39.776
Their way of speaking.

06:39.843 --> 06:41.178
Me, Laszlo.

06:41.245 --> 06:42.481
Do you people have names

06:42.548 --> 06:44.552
or do you communicate
with sticks?

06:44.619 --> 06:46.590
I had become one of them.

06:46.657 --> 06:47.725
I think this is going well.

06:47.792 --> 06:49.094
This is the matriarch of this

06:49.161 --> 06:50.598
very important family to me,

06:50.665 --> 06:51.967
-okay? Yes?
-Yeah, yeah.

06:52.034 --> 06:53.637
-Yia-Yia.
-Yia-Yia.

06:53.704 --> 06:55.407
Lovely to meet you, I'm sure.

06:55.473 --> 06:56.710
[Nadja speaking Greek]

06:56.777 --> 06:58.379
He was dropped on his head
as a baby.

06:58.446 --> 07:00.785
[speaking Greek]

07:04.960 --> 07:07.064
Any big plans
for the summertime?

07:07.130 --> 07:08.567
Not really.

07:08.634 --> 07:11.673
So, I met Nandor at the gym.
I was doing

07:11.740 --> 07:14.044
my reps, and he, uh,
I don't know,

07:14.111 --> 07:17.351
he-he seemed harmless and

07:17.417 --> 07:20.190
kind of lonely, and, uh...

07:20.256 --> 07:22.461
then he asked me here, and...

07:22.528 --> 07:25.668
I don't know, I'm here.
Uh, I don't know.

07:25.735 --> 07:27.805
-It just happened.
-[Nandor exclaims]

07:27.872 --> 07:29.876
[siren wailing on screen]

07:29.943 --> 07:33.282
-You are enjoying the movie?
-[woman] Shh!

07:33.349 --> 07:34.719
[chuckles]

07:34.786 --> 07:37.357
I remember the first time
I went to one.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.461
There was a locomotion film
playing.

07:39.529 --> 07:40.865
And we all thought,

07:40.931 --> 07:42.134
"This train's gonna kill us!"
And, of course--

07:42.200 --> 07:44.204
-[man] Shut up!
-Shh.

07:44.271 --> 07:47.277
Yes. Yes, you're right.

07:47.344 --> 07:49.516
Zero is the amount
of paperwork you'd have to file

07:49.582 --> 07:52.555
-after I replace
-Excuse me.

07:52.622 --> 07:56.329
our entire outdated system...

07:56.395 --> 07:58.232
[clears throat]

07:58.299 --> 08:00.070
Mr. Robinson, are you all right?

08:00.136 --> 08:02.542
Yeah. No, no.
It's not my turn. You go.

08:02.608 --> 08:05.246
With a seamless, user-friendly,

08:05.313 --> 08:06.783
digital platform.

08:06.850 --> 08:09.455
Eliminate bureaucracy.

08:09.522 --> 08:12.027
Say goodbye to paperwork.

08:12.094 --> 08:15.166
-And hello to anarchy.
-[applause]

08:15.233 --> 08:16.703
You're-you're clapping
for an anarchist.

08:16.770 --> 08:18.841
[Barbara]
Thank you. Thank you very much.

08:18.907 --> 08:21.947
-[loud, distorted] Four weeks
ago, when I started this...
-[crowd exclaiming]

08:22.749 --> 08:25.353
Check, check.
Microphone, microphone.

08:25.420 --> 08:27.057
With the debate stage,

08:27.124 --> 08:30.531
what you have
is a captive audience.

08:30.598 --> 08:33.369
-Do you know how this...
-[microphone feedback]

08:33.436 --> 08:36.810
It's like a smorgasbord.

08:36.877 --> 08:40.651
[inhales] Four weeks ago,

08:40.718 --> 08:43.122
I was sitting down

08:43.189 --> 08:45.661
for breakfast with my

08:45.728 --> 08:47.064
beautiful wife, Evie.

08:47.130 --> 08:50.103
Evie and I were sitting down
with our two

08:50.170 --> 08:52.742
beautiful little boys,

08:52.809 --> 08:55.480
Connor and
C-C-- Cah-- ristopher,

08:55.548 --> 08:57.852
and Christopher

08:57.919 --> 08:59.455
looks up to me-- he's

08:59.522 --> 09:03.196
six years old
and full of the dickens--

09:03.262 --> 09:04.999
[speaking accelerates]

09:05.066 --> 09:08.574
And I said, "Well,
it's because of the taxes,

09:08.640 --> 09:09.843
Conno-- Christopher."

09:09.909 --> 09:11.513
[speaking accelerates]

09:11.580 --> 09:15.554
And I'll be damned if there's
anyone in this hall right now...

09:16.422 --> 09:18.259
[speaking accelerates]

09:18.326 --> 09:20.531
...smells often of beef stew,

09:20.598 --> 09:22.602
as all young children do.

09:22.668 --> 09:25.574
[speaking accelerates]

09:25.641 --> 09:28.781
Your allowance is being cut

09:28.847 --> 09:30.851
because mommy lost her job.

09:30.918 --> 09:33.256
Mommy lost her job to

09:33.322 --> 09:36.395
an M'er-F'ing machine.

09:36.462 --> 09:38.032
A machine that

09:38.099 --> 09:39.702
ran over my foot

09:39.769 --> 09:41.606
on a factory floor.

09:41.673 --> 09:43.376
-[man] Unbelievable.
-[Evie] And is a-a

09:43.443 --> 09:46.583
machine gonna tuck my two sons--

09:46.650 --> 09:49.856
who are full of the dickens--
into bed?

09:49.923 --> 09:52.762
You think that machine
can give my boys

09:52.829 --> 09:54.264
their goodnight kissies?

09:54.331 --> 09:57.070
How's that gonna work?
Bleep, bloop, bloop, mwah.

09:57.137 --> 10:00.410
I sure would like
to meet that machine

10:00.477 --> 10:03.382
and tell it to pay
for my medical bills. [gasps]

10:03.449 --> 10:05.220
[crowd gasps]

10:06.155 --> 10:08.292
[Colin] That machine
ruined our gosh darn

10:08.359 --> 10:11.165
C-Chrosstopher's life.

10:13.069 --> 10:16.175
No, really, you were so good.

10:16.242 --> 10:18.514
I-I doubt I'll get
a single vote. [laughing]

10:18.580 --> 10:20.383
Oh. Very nice.

10:20.450 --> 10:22.688
So, what do you want to do now?

10:22.755 --> 10:24.526
Oh, I don't know.
We could catch up.

10:24.592 --> 10:25.995
I really have thought about you

10:26.061 --> 10:28.867
quite a bit
these last few years.

10:28.934 --> 10:30.871
-I guess our Uber is here.
-Yeah.

10:30.938 --> 10:32.474
-Oh.
-[Colin] Not our Uber.

10:32.542 --> 10:33.677
-[Evie] Oh! Ow.
-[grunts]

10:33.744 --> 10:35.079
[Colin]
What the hell?!

10:44.532 --> 10:47.470
[Colin]
European Middle Ages, in which
monks wore hoods or cowls...

10:47.538 --> 10:49.374
[Evie]
This is triggering because
I was blind as a child,

10:49.441 --> 10:50.476
and I'm having flashbacks.

10:50.544 --> 10:52.815
[man]
Enough! Be quiet!

10:52.882 --> 10:54.886
You guys can join us,

10:54.953 --> 10:57.090
but if you're hoping to get
any interesting footage,

10:57.157 --> 10:59.361
you came to exactly
the wrong place.

11:02.367 --> 11:03.737
[lever clangs]

11:05.240 --> 11:06.208
[Evie]
Ow.

11:06.275 --> 11:08.580
[Colin]
Where-where are we?

11:08.647 --> 11:09.782
Wait, a-are you...

11:09.849 --> 11:12.053
Okay. Uh, so,

11:12.120 --> 11:14.191
calling to order
this emergency meeting

11:14.258 --> 11:17.565
of the Supreme Council
of Energy Vampires.

11:17.632 --> 11:19.101
[Evie]
It's real?

11:19.167 --> 11:20.638
I'd always heard rumors, but...

11:20.704 --> 11:22.942
A-Are we in trouble?

11:23.009 --> 11:24.846
Well, uh, what we have here

11:24.913 --> 11:27.652
-is a situation in...
-[phone chimes]

11:27.718 --> 11:29.321
Sorry, let me turn that off.

11:29.388 --> 11:32.795
So annoying, right?
Like, "Okay, Boomer."

11:32.862 --> 11:35.868
As I-I was saying, uh,
what we do have here

11:35.935 --> 11:38.272
-is a situation in which we...
-[phone chimes]

11:38.339 --> 11:40.310
-Hey.
-[Gregg] Uh, what you're
gonna want to do

11:40.376 --> 11:43.249
is go to your home screen

11:43.316 --> 11:45.320
and look for "Settings."

11:45.386 --> 11:46.790
-I'm not... I'm not seeing that.
-[Gregg] And you open that up,

11:46.856 --> 11:48.359
and you're looking for "Alerts."

11:48.426 --> 11:50.531
-It should be
listed alphabetical,
-[Jo] I...

11:50.598 --> 11:52.467
-so "Alerts"
would be at the top of that.
-[Jo] I am not seeing that.

11:52.535 --> 11:54.171
[Gregg]
It could also be under
"Sounds and Haptics."

11:54.238 --> 11:55.841
I don't know what
operating system you're running.

11:55.908 --> 11:58.847
Sorry I'm late.
What'd I miss?

11:58.914 --> 12:00.216
You're not late.
You were actually sitting there

12:00.283 --> 12:01.085
the whole time.

12:01.151 --> 12:02.855
Yeah, but I-I wasn't listening,

12:02.922 --> 12:05.059
so could somebody bring me
up to speed, please?

12:05.126 --> 12:06.428
[Jo]
They were asking if

12:06.496 --> 12:08.767
they're in trouble,
and I was saying that

12:08.834 --> 12:10.504
what we have here
is a situation in which...

12:10.571 --> 12:12.875
-[phone chimes]
-Shucks.
-[Gregg] Home screen.

12:12.942 --> 12:15.614
-[Jo] Okay. Mm.
-"Settings."

12:15.681 --> 12:16.917
Alert settings,

12:16.983 --> 12:18.419
and then what
you're gonna need to do

12:18.486 --> 12:21.760
-is find the, uh...
-My God, they are fantastic.

12:21.826 --> 12:23.229
Oh, yeah. This is awful.

12:23.296 --> 12:24.464
[low volume]
Maybe we should move on

12:24.532 --> 12:25.834
to the business at hand?

12:25.901 --> 12:27.738
-We can't hear you.
-[Jo] Just speak up.

12:27.805 --> 12:30.410
[low volume]
Oh, sorry. One moment.

12:30.476 --> 12:32.080
[Jo]
Just speak up.

12:32.147 --> 12:34.184
Shake it.

12:34.251 --> 12:35.888
[low volume]
Okay. How about now?

12:35.955 --> 12:37.123
-No, no. Shake it.
-Mm-mmm.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.827
[Jo]
Y-You're gonna need to speak up.

12:38.894 --> 12:40.564
[low volume]
Maybe it's the Wi-Fi connection.

12:40.631 --> 12:42.067
I'm literally shouting.

12:42.133 --> 12:43.704
That would literally
have nothing to do with it.

12:43.770 --> 12:45.373
[Colin]
Uh, why don't you check

12:45.440 --> 12:47.812
the XLR cable connection.

12:47.878 --> 12:49.916
[low volume]
Colin Robinson, Evie Russell,

12:49.983 --> 12:51.519
you have been summoned here...

12:51.586 --> 12:53.590
Does somebody want to
interrupt her and let her know

12:53.657 --> 12:56.128
that, at this point,
she is completely inaudible?

12:56.195 --> 12:58.800
Yeah, no problem.
You're not-you're not audible

12:58.867 --> 13:00.403
due to the low volume

13:00.470 --> 13:02.642
-of your microphone.
-[low volume] I'm shouting.

13:02.708 --> 13:03.910
[phone chimes]

13:03.977 --> 13:05.914
I am blowing up today.

13:05.981 --> 13:08.920
Listen, uh, if we don't
survive this,

13:08.987 --> 13:10.356
I-I just want you to know that

13:10.423 --> 13:11.793
-I've always loved...
-[Aparna] Colin Robinson,

13:11.860 --> 13:14.565
no side conversations, please.

13:14.632 --> 13:16.335
-[volume fades]
-[Hannibal] I am at a loss.

13:16.402 --> 13:17.738
-Do we have an agenda?
-[phone chimes]

13:17.805 --> 13:19.041
[Gregg]
System settings.

13:19.107 --> 13:20.310
[Jo]
I have something
called Settings?

13:20.376 --> 13:22.047
[Nandor]
My good friend Alexander

13:22.113 --> 13:24.184
has yet to call me back
on the telephone.

13:24.251 --> 13:26.255
-[whispering indistinctly]
-Who is that? Is that Alexander?

13:26.322 --> 13:28.192
No. Why would I be talking
to Alexander?

13:28.259 --> 13:31.332
I gave Alexander your number
because I do not have a phone.

13:31.398 --> 13:35.206
Does this fill me with
a crippling sense of self-doubt?

13:35.273 --> 13:36.943
Sometimes.

13:37.010 --> 13:38.580
It's not fair!

13:38.647 --> 13:40.617
Perhaps we are just
too different to be friends.

13:40.684 --> 13:42.621
But I can fix.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.128
Master, you know I would
do anything for you, but

13:46.195 --> 13:48.099
I'm not gonna circumcise you.

13:48.165 --> 13:49.602
Here's me in the corner.

13:49.669 --> 13:52.842
Here's me in the spotlight
at my circumcision.

13:52.908 --> 13:53.944
Master, you just can't
get circumcised

13:54.011 --> 13:55.113
for a friend you met at the gym.

13:55.179 --> 13:56.616
Guillermo, there's no other way.

13:56.683 --> 13:57.852
How can two men be friends

13:57.918 --> 13:59.054
when they are so different?

13:59.121 --> 14:00.056
You and I are different.

14:00.123 --> 14:02.293
You are. I am not.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.499
It's time for you

14:04.565 --> 14:07.470
to snip my tip.

14:07.538 --> 14:10.209
Enjoy. [chuckles]

14:11.913 --> 14:14.017
-[laughs]
-Hello, my sexy, Greek,

14:14.084 --> 14:15.420
extended family.

14:15.486 --> 14:16.656
Ah, Laszlo.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.794
Gather round.
I have something I want to say.

14:18.860 --> 14:20.864
[Nadja]
Oh, Laszlo, Yia-Yia.

14:20.931 --> 14:22.501
[Laszlo]
The memory of a song,

14:22.568 --> 14:23.770
when executed properly,

14:23.837 --> 14:25.607
can be a powerful gift.

14:25.674 --> 14:27.712
[speaks Greek]

14:27.778 --> 14:30.551
[singing in Greek]

14:33.389 --> 14:34.458
[shouts in Greek]

14:34.525 --> 14:36.228
[Nadja]
Had my sweet love, Laszlo,

14:36.295 --> 14:37.698
consulted me before just

14:37.765 --> 14:39.602
putting on a big concert
in front of my new family,

14:39.669 --> 14:42.508
I would have probably said
maybe don't sing the battle hymn

14:42.575 --> 14:45.313
of our neighboring island,
Nisida Mongonisi,

14:45.379 --> 14:48.119
because that place is the home
of our mortal enemies,

14:48.185 --> 14:49.856
the Nisida Mongonisans.

14:49.922 --> 14:51.058
[spits]

14:51.125 --> 14:52.495
-Hold on a second, my--
-Shut up!

14:52.561 --> 14:54.699
[Nadja] Who told you
that was a good idea?!

14:54.766 --> 14:56.335
-All right, my darling.
-[Nadja] You were singing,

14:56.402 --> 14:57.972
"Kill them, kill them,
kill them."

14:58.038 --> 15:00.410
How many times have I said that
to you in Greek?

15:01.478 --> 15:03.449
-[phone chimes]
-[Gregg] We can't hear you.

15:03.517 --> 15:05.153
You're just gonna
need to speak up.

15:05.219 --> 15:07.625
Feels like we should
turn this over

15:07.691 --> 15:08.960
to the chairman at this point.

15:09.027 --> 15:12.000
Yes. Uh, so, uh, do we...

15:12.066 --> 15:15.741
-Um...
-Hello. Yes.

15:15.808 --> 15:17.678
I can take it from here.

15:17.745 --> 15:20.884
Thank you for softening them up.

15:20.951 --> 15:23.088
Okay.
Now, who is this?

15:23.155 --> 15:24.725
-[Jo] The Chairman.
-[Gregg] Uh, you've
worked with her

15:24.792 --> 15:26.896
-for 15 years now.
-[Hannibal] Is that right?

15:26.963 --> 15:27.998
Did she get
a haircut or something?

15:28.065 --> 15:29.367
Colin Robinson.

15:29.434 --> 15:32.307
Your opponent
Barbara Lazarro's platform

15:32.373 --> 15:34.745
is a direct threat
to the lifeblood

15:34.812 --> 15:36.583
of energy vampires,

15:36.649 --> 15:38.653
which is--

15:38.720 --> 15:40.022
what's the word--

15:40.089 --> 15:41.493
bureaucracy.

15:41.559 --> 15:44.397
-Bureaucracy.
-[Martha] And bureaucracy is...

15:44.464 --> 15:47.103
How do I put this?
I feel like there's

15:47.170 --> 15:48.540
-a slogan...
-Oh.

15:48.607 --> 15:50.309
Bureaucracy is the gum

15:50.376 --> 15:53.082
that clogs the gears
of every human endeavor.

15:53.149 --> 15:55.186
The petty BS, in triplicate,

15:55.253 --> 15:56.556
-[groans]
-that reminds

15:56.623 --> 15:58.960
the common man that
he is a useless speck

15:59.027 --> 16:00.497
and has kept energy vampires

16:00.564 --> 16:03.804
everywhere well-fed,
fat, and happy.

16:03.870 --> 16:06.475
[others]
All hail bureaucracy.

16:06.543 --> 16:09.014
Enough.
I can't take it anymore.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.251
Why are we here?
W-What do you want us to do?

16:11.318 --> 16:14.525
You must beat Barbara Lazarro,

16:14.592 --> 16:15.661
or else.

16:15.727 --> 16:18.098
How do you expect me
to beat Barbara Lazarro?

16:18.165 --> 16:19.434
I-I can't win.

16:19.502 --> 16:20.537
Even if I could,

16:20.604 --> 16:22.942
I don't even want
to be comptroller.

16:23.008 --> 16:25.146
This is how we feed, dummy.

16:25.213 --> 16:27.818
You need to protect
our way of life.

16:27.885 --> 16:28.887
What if I don't?

16:28.954 --> 16:31.258
We have certain methods

16:31.325 --> 16:33.630
for persuading the reluctant.

16:33.697 --> 16:36.001
[wheels squeaking]

16:36.870 --> 16:38.472
Turn it around. It's backwards.

16:38.540 --> 16:39.742
-[Martha] I can't see it.
-[Aparna] It's backwards.

16:39.809 --> 16:41.245
Turn it so it faces them,

16:41.311 --> 16:42.715
but also is facing me.

16:42.781 --> 16:45.319
[Aparna]
Turn it so the screen
is facing us.

16:45.386 --> 16:46.923
-[Martha] No, they can't see it.
-[Hannibal] To the left more.

16:46.990 --> 16:48.593
-Left, left.
-[Gregg] Please be
more expedient.

16:48.660 --> 16:49.595
Thank you.

16:49.662 --> 16:53.035
Slide one of 543:

16:53.102 --> 16:55.439
"Hurry Up and Wait:
An Argument for

16:55.507 --> 16:57.310
-"and Statistical Review

-[Evie] Make it stop.

-"of Energy Vampire Preservation

"Via Bureaucracy,

-[Colin] Fine. Fine.

17:02.888 --> 17:04.759
We-We'll do it, just...

17:04.825 --> 17:06.428
please let us out of here.

17:06.496 --> 17:08.465
Thanks, but we-we're
still gonna read it.

17:08.533 --> 17:10.469
-[Colin sighs]
-Just to reiterate. Still gonna

17:10.537 --> 17:12.040
-watch it and read it.
-[Martha] "Part One,
Section One..."

17:17.016 --> 17:19.221
And I'm here to fight
for the change you deserve,

17:19.287 --> 17:21.993
Staten Island. And with
all of you, my Colin-izers,

17:22.060 --> 17:23.997
by my side, I can't lose.

17:24.064 --> 17:27.036
[laughs]
I'm so full of passion,

17:27.103 --> 17:28.640
I just want to scream!

17:28.707 --> 17:30.443
[laughs, screams, whoops]

17:30.510 --> 17:33.583
And now we're off
to Mariners Harbor,

17:33.650 --> 17:34.885
Midland Beach,

17:34.952 --> 17:38.058
Randall Manor. Yee-haw!

17:38.125 --> 17:40.162
Okay. I'm just gonna take

17:40.229 --> 17:42.033
a quick break now
to settle down.

17:42.100 --> 17:45.039
[whimpers]
I can't keep doing this.

17:45.106 --> 17:48.513
Uh, I can't keep
pretending to be

17:48.580 --> 17:50.884
Mr. Charisma
to all these nimrods.

17:50.951 --> 17:52.320
It's awful.

17:52.387 --> 17:53.990
But the Energy Vampire
Council said

17:54.057 --> 17:56.729
we have to win, or else.

17:56.796 --> 17:57.831
[exhales]

17:57.898 --> 17:59.635
No. No. No.

17:59.702 --> 18:02.073
Enough. It ends now.

18:02.140 --> 18:04.077
What?

18:04.144 --> 18:05.814
Okay, where was I?

18:05.881 --> 18:09.054
-Let's see here. Meiers Corners.
-[voters cheering]

18:09.120 --> 18:11.224
Graniteville.
How about Fort Wadsworth?

18:11.291 --> 18:12.628
Do I hear anyone from

18:12.695 --> 18:14.397
Randall Manor?!

18:14.464 --> 18:17.136
-[woman gasps]
-[laughs] All right!

18:17.203 --> 18:18.540
What?

18:18.607 --> 18:21.679
Oh, i-it-it's not
what it looks like.

18:21.746 --> 18:23.917
I was just beating off

18:23.984 --> 18:25.821
to all your beautiful faces

18:25.887 --> 18:27.524
during the break, and I-I guess

18:27.591 --> 18:30.931
I forgot to pull up my-my pants.

18:30.998 --> 18:33.870
[Nandor]
So, I waited, like,

18:33.937 --> 18:35.607
five hours at the gym

18:35.674 --> 18:37.845
to bump into
my friend Alexander.

18:37.911 --> 18:41.151
Then, when he finally
did show up...

18:41.218 --> 18:43.857
Alexander! Come on.
Oh, Alexander!

18:43.923 --> 18:45.393
I don't know.

18:45.459 --> 18:48.098
Maybe I rushed things a little
with my big reveal.

18:48.165 --> 18:51.438
Alexander! Ta-da!

18:51.506 --> 18:52.741
Twins.

18:52.808 --> 18:54.110
Alexander, wait.

18:54.177 --> 18:55.981
I got to get out
of this fucking city.

18:56.048 --> 18:57.083
[Nandor]
Alexander!

18:57.150 --> 18:58.720
The excitement of our friendship

18:58.787 --> 19:00.089
made me overlook
my vampire powers.

19:00.156 --> 19:01.793
Hi.

19:01.859 --> 19:04.598
My foreskin grew back very fast.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.602
Now he thinks I'm meshuggener,

19:06.669 --> 19:10.309
which means he thinks
I'm a little bit of a putz.

19:11.879 --> 19:14.150
[indistinct chatter]

19:16.889 --> 19:18.560
Shh.

19:20.764 --> 19:21.933
Shh. Pss, pss, pss, pss.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.570
[Laszlo]
No, don't stop,
not on my account.

19:23.636 --> 19:25.139
Keep going.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.043
Now, I know I'm different
from you people,

19:27.110 --> 19:28.312
but I am who I am.

19:28.379 --> 19:30.049
"And who are you?"
I hear you ask.

19:30.116 --> 19:32.220
-Fuck's sake.
-[Laszlo] Well,
that's a good question.

19:32.286 --> 19:34.057
-[speaking Greek]
-I...

19:34.124 --> 19:36.496
am an esteemed
British gentleman,

19:36.562 --> 19:38.232
well-bred to the manor born.

19:38.298 --> 19:40.102
I can speak 14 languages,

19:40.169 --> 19:41.371
as long as they are English.

19:41.438 --> 19:43.242
I can play any instrument,

19:43.308 --> 19:44.612
apart from bagpipes.

19:44.678 --> 19:46.816
They sound fucking terrible
to everyone.

19:46.883 --> 19:48.753
I can fashion any tree,

19:48.820 --> 19:50.389
any hedge, into a vulva.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.427
In the days before medicine,
I survived

19:52.494 --> 19:55.166
gonorrhea, chlamydia,

19:55.232 --> 19:58.105
the plague, clubfoot, leprosy,

19:58.172 --> 20:00.744
black fever, yellow fever,

20:00.811 --> 20:02.480
night fever.

20:02.548 --> 20:04.752
But most important,
and I must emphasize

20:04.819 --> 20:07.156
that this is the most important
thing about me:

20:07.223 --> 20:10.029
I am a certified

20:10.096 --> 20:11.465
master cocksman.

20:11.532 --> 20:13.135
-[sighs]
-To cut this short

20:13.202 --> 20:14.672
and to get straight
to the point,

20:14.739 --> 20:17.845
you can all go
f-f-fuck yourselves.

20:17.911 --> 20:19.280
-[others groan]
-Oh, for fuck's sake, Laszlo.

20:19.347 --> 20:21.986
-[all speaking Greek]
-Very hard.

20:22.053 --> 20:24.492
[speaking Greek]

20:25.259 --> 20:26.194
What's she doing, my love?

20:26.261 --> 20:28.165
What's happening?

20:28.232 --> 20:30.469
[all speaking Greek]

20:34.512 --> 20:37.918
[Nadja]
By some stroke of dumb luck,

20:37.985 --> 20:40.824
my new family absolutely
bloody love Laszlo.

20:40.891 --> 20:43.763
You see, there is a tale
in my country

20:43.830 --> 20:45.801
that has been passed down
through generations

20:45.867 --> 20:47.604
of a wet-headed,

20:47.671 --> 20:49.842
wide-bodied, ignorant oaf,

20:49.909 --> 20:51.646
with the brains
of a chewing gums.

20:51.712 --> 20:54.518
This spirit is said to
continually reincarnate itself,

20:54.585 --> 20:57.423
but always as a pompous,
perverted oaf.

20:57.490 --> 21:00.129
And my family think
it is, well,

21:00.196 --> 21:01.599
Laszlo.

21:01.666 --> 21:04.237
And when you are in the presence
of this spirit,

21:04.304 --> 21:07.376
it brings good luck
and good fortune to everyone.

21:07.443 --> 21:08.913
Hello there. How are you?

21:08.980 --> 21:10.984
Vasiliás Pyuroni.

21:11.051 --> 21:13.222
The king of pigs.

21:13.288 --> 21:15.894
My king of pigs.

21:15.961 --> 21:17.196
[cheering]

21:17.263 --> 21:20.169
-He's very, very, very stupid.
-[laughs]

21:20.236 --> 21:23.576
I want to say to my young boys,

21:23.643 --> 21:25.947
uh, Connor and Cra--

21:26.014 --> 21:28.018
Christoph... pher,

21:28.085 --> 21:31.659
to them, I say I'm sorry,
Daddy's coming home.

21:33.496 --> 21:36.168
I-I'd like to say
a few words myself.

21:36.234 --> 21:37.370
[clears throat]

21:37.436 --> 21:39.608
Thank you in advance

21:39.675 --> 21:43.215
for respecting
my family's privacy--

21:43.282 --> 21:45.887
don't touch me--

21:45.954 --> 21:49.962
while we deal
with this isolated incident

21:50.029 --> 21:52.935
in which my husband

21:53.001 --> 21:55.507
flashed and mooned

21:55.574 --> 21:57.878
the beautiful voters

21:57.945 --> 21:59.414
of Staten Island

21:59.480 --> 22:02.186
after a poorly-timed

22:02.253 --> 22:04.090
masturbation sesh.

22:04.157 --> 22:07.965
As well as
the isolated incident in which

22:08.031 --> 22:09.969
we woke up to

22:10.035 --> 22:12.574
what sounded like a burglar
in our house,

22:12.641 --> 22:14.812
and my husband
immediately yelled,

22:14.879 --> 22:17.751
"Take her and my kids,
don't take me"

22:17.818 --> 22:19.454
-before realizing
-[people gasp]

22:19.522 --> 22:22.326
it was just a racoon
outside our house.

22:23.095 --> 22:25.165
This man has let us all down.

22:25.232 --> 22:26.769
But I will make it up to you

22:26.836 --> 22:29.875
by becoming your next
borough comptroller.

22:29.942 --> 22:31.177
[cheering]

22:31.244 --> 22:32.848
[Sean]
All right!

22:38.058 --> 22:39.795
[Colin]
I was surprised that

22:39.862 --> 22:43.503
Evie ran in my place.
Only

22:43.570 --> 22:45.574
18 people voted.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.376
So, with the write-in votes

22:47.443 --> 22:49.347
that Evie got from her

22:49.414 --> 22:50.884
breakup group--

22:50.951 --> 22:53.590
well, it was enough
to carry the day.

22:53.656 --> 22:55.125
I think she'll do

22:55.192 --> 22:56.729
the council proud.
I-I'm

22:56.796 --> 22:59.367
-happy for her.
-Colin Robinson.

22:59.434 --> 23:02.073
Evie Russell.
What are you doing here?

23:02.139 --> 23:04.377
I wanted to let you know...

23:04.444 --> 23:06.782
[clears throat]

23:06.849 --> 23:08.018
I'm sad.

23:08.085 --> 23:11.559
Why? I thought you'd enjoy
being comptroller.

23:11.626 --> 23:14.330
I'm sad because

23:14.397 --> 23:16.535
we can't see each other anymore.

23:17.504 --> 23:19.742
But maybe you and I

23:19.808 --> 23:22.848
could meet up
every once in a while

23:22.915 --> 23:25.687
-and later...
-I don't want to do that.

23:25.754 --> 23:27.791
-But maybe w-we can--
-I-I'm sorry.

23:27.858 --> 23:30.664
-I should give this back to you.
-Yeah, I want this back.

23:30.730 --> 23:32.968
I hope you didn't
pay too much for it.

23:33.035 --> 23:34.705
It gave me a rash,
so I think it's made of

23:34.772 --> 23:36.374
some kind of really cheap metal.

23:36.441 --> 23:37.945
It's not metal.

23:38.011 --> 23:40.282
Oh. Well...

23:40.349 --> 23:43.088
I wish it didn't
have to be this way.

23:44.457 --> 23:46.061
[sighs]

23:46.127 --> 23:48.432
Evie, wh-why?

23:48.499 --> 23:50.904
It's...

23:50.971 --> 23:53.041
complicated.
