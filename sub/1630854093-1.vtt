WEBVTT

03:20.300 --> 03:21.401
Agojie! Agoj...

03:23.236 --> 03:24.839
Agojie!

04:09.316 --> 04:10.785
No!

04:30.303 --> 04:31.506
Where are the prisoners?

04:31.639 --> 04:33.273
Where are our people?

04:33.406 --> 04:36.043
We are farmers. We took no one!

04:36.177 --> 04:37.845
Miganon.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.410
You will be home soon.

05:28.361 --> 05:30.397
Horses.

05:32.465 --> 05:35.335
That can only mean oyo soldiers.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.116
Who is she?

05:50.518 --> 05:52.320
My mother.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.222
We will take you back
to your village.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.424
- Perhaps your father...
- They sold him.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.427
And my brothers.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.462
They sold them all.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.614
Miganon.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.617
The prisoners are ready
to march.

06:29.657 --> 06:34.028
Bring me stronger warriors.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.760
Thank you.

07:09.330 --> 07:11.464
It doesn't Matt... nawi!

07:11.599 --> 07:13.433
- Yeah?
- Tell your mother

07:13.567 --> 07:15.269
to see me for the dress.

07:15.403 --> 07:17.271
What dress?

07:17.405 --> 07:19.439
Your wedding dress.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.976
I will make you beautiful.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.344
Tell her.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.913
They have made you
another match?

07:26.047 --> 07:29.417
I don't know what
she's talking about.

07:31.252 --> 07:32.320
They are coming.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.555
Let's go.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.496
Come here!

07:43.631 --> 07:46.667
- Daughter! Come!
- My daughter!

07:46.801 --> 07:49.437
My sister!

07:49.570 --> 07:51.072
My sister!

07:51.205 --> 07:52.506
Mother!

07:52.640 --> 07:54.875
I'm so happy to see you.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.777
- But I want to see.
- Shh!

08:29.910 --> 08:33.780
The king does not allow us
to look upon the agojie.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.521
Nanisca.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.622
It is a victory.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.957
They are here for you.

09:17.091 --> 09:19.860
They do not know
an evil is coming.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.231
They know you will protect them.

09:28.903 --> 09:30.771
I wish to speak to the king.

09:30.905 --> 09:32.606
He's only seeing wives today.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.809
Tell him. I will wait.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.877
The agojie drink from the skulls

09:37.011 --> 09:39.480
of the men they have killed.
- No.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.048
They cut off their heads

09:41.182 --> 09:44.553
and melt off their skin
in boiling hot cauldrons.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.755
- Sister! Sister!
- Nawi.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.690
- Hmm?
- We have a visitor.

09:49.824 --> 09:52.226
It's a rich man from cana.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.461
Come.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.796
Come.

09:55.930 --> 09:58.899
Maybe he is handsome.

10:09.810 --> 10:13.647
I own three fields
of palm trees.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.117
You will work.

10:18.686 --> 10:22.022
You do not talk to your husband?

10:25.226 --> 10:28.262
In my house,
you will learn to obey.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.733
Nawi!

10:33.734 --> 10:35.936
Forgive my daughter.

10:37.606 --> 10:39.541
The whispers were right.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.642
This...

10:41.775 --> 10:44.011
Girl is worthless.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.715
Master abade.

10:54.288 --> 10:55.823
Come!

11:00.828 --> 11:04.665
I wish to give my daughter
to the king.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.944
No husband will have her.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.847
I will not marry an old man
who beats me.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.849
Go to war, then.

11:21.982 --> 11:25.719
You will understand
what pain is.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.958
Enter.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.672
In the palace,
you do not have to look away.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.308
Come.

11:58.953 --> 12:00.555
Close your mouth.

12:00.689 --> 12:02.356
You look like a fish.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.371
What's in there?

12:17.505 --> 12:19.708
Indigo dye.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.710
Oh.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.646
What did you think it was?

12:24.778 --> 12:26.615
Heads.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.782
No.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.918
Those are the heads.

12:31.051 --> 12:34.623
Some of the men
who raided our village.

12:34.755 --> 12:37.758
The rest will be sold in ouidah.

12:39.193 --> 12:40.961
No men but the eunuchs
are allowed

12:41.095 --> 12:42.863
in the palace after dark.

12:42.997 --> 12:46.267
Beyond this wall,
this is a palace of women.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.513
Come.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.211
Hey.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.249
Go and bathe yourselves.

14:18.092 --> 14:20.928
Oyo, can you see this?

14:21.061 --> 14:25.834
Your comrades murdered...

14:25.966 --> 14:27.401
By women.

14:29.870 --> 14:37.044
The dahomey grow too bold
under their new king.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.481
My loves.

14:41.716 --> 14:43.050
My loves.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.854
My love.

14:46.788 --> 14:49.089
My love.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.327
Nanisca, come with me.

15:04.405 --> 15:07.007
Why does he always favor her?

15:07.141 --> 15:11.145
She comes here filthy,
shows no respect.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.782
She fought for him
during the coup.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.550
Put him on the throne.

15:15.683 --> 15:17.951
What did you do?

15:18.085 --> 15:20.954
Locked yourself in a cupboard.

15:26.193 --> 15:29.163
The oyo have entered our land.

15:30.063 --> 15:33.000
They have broken the peace.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.804
When they come for the tribute,

15:35.936 --> 15:37.605
we will not pay it.

15:39.741 --> 15:41.621
- But that would mean war.
- Migan, we have been

15:41.709 --> 15:43.977
under the foot of the oyo
since my father's time.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.480
Are you not tired? Eh?

15:46.614 --> 15:50.017
Oh, because we...
We fear their might.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.587
Because of fear.

15:52.720 --> 15:56.891
My king, they are a nation
twice our size,

15:57.024 --> 15:58.492
with horses and more muskets.

15:58.626 --> 16:01.796
We need time to plan
and prepare our armies.

16:01.930 --> 16:03.330
The agojie are ready.

16:03.464 --> 16:05.999
How many did you lose
in this last battle

16:06.133 --> 16:09.036
against the lowly mahi?

16:09.169 --> 16:13.173
My king, I hear whispers
of a new general.

16:13.307 --> 16:16.578
This last attack
was sword rattling.

16:16.711 --> 16:17.946
Nothing more.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.279
I agree.

16:19.413 --> 16:20.915
Dahomey has prospered
in the peace.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.382
And the oyo, too.

16:22.517 --> 16:25.920
The slave trade
is the reason we prosper.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.254
But at what price?

16:27.387 --> 16:30.023
It is a poison
slowly killing us,

16:30.157 --> 16:31.559
and the Europeans know this.

16:31.693 --> 16:34.328
They come to our land
for their human cargo.

16:34.461 --> 16:35.996
They've come to trade.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.498
We sell them what they want.

16:37.632 --> 16:39.901
But why do we sell our captives?

16:40.033 --> 16:41.703
For weapons?

16:41.836 --> 16:44.271
To capture more people
to sell for more weapons?

16:44.404 --> 16:47.876
It is a dark circle with no end.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.878
This is not the way.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.813
The spirits have spoken.

16:51.946 --> 16:53.715
IfÃ¡ seeks light.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.150
So, what do you suggest,
nanisca?

16:57.284 --> 16:59.988
We have other things to sell.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.221
Gold. Palm oil.

17:01.355 --> 17:02.824
We can double our harvest.

17:02.957 --> 17:05.025
She wants to make us
a nation of peasants.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.662
I want dahomey to survive.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.800
The gods have brought us
a new king.

17:12.934 --> 17:15.002
A king to be feared.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.470
No one fears a farmer.

17:16.604 --> 17:21.040
We have already started
to gather the tribute.

17:21.174 --> 17:24.344
Perhaps we pay, to buy us time.

17:28.147 --> 17:30.217
I promise...

17:30.350 --> 17:33.521
This will be our last.

17:33.655 --> 17:38.292
As for the palm oil,
nanisca, show me.

17:38.425 --> 17:42.296
Show me how much you can
produce, and we will see.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.944
You speak in secret to the king.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.812
You seek to cut me out.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.080
If the king respects me,

18:00.213 --> 18:02.717
it is because I have earned it.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.089
Gboje.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.560
I am amenza.

18:12.694 --> 18:15.863
You come to the palace of ghezo,

18:15.997 --> 18:18.365
the ninth monarch
of the dahomey people,

18:18.498 --> 18:22.036
descendants of
the leopard agasu,

18:22.169 --> 18:27.542
beloved of the twin gods,
mawu and her brother Lisa.

18:27.675 --> 18:31.579
You are called to join
the king's guard.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.088
We fight...

18:40.220 --> 18:42.255
Or we die.

18:45.225 --> 18:48.863
We fight for dahomey,

18:48.997 --> 18:50.999
for our sisters,

18:51.131 --> 18:53.166
for our great king.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.169
You will be revered.

18:57.270 --> 19:00.108
You will be paid for your work.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.843
Your opinions will be heard.

19:01.976 --> 19:06.346
No tribe or kingdom
in all of Africa

19:06.480 --> 19:09.182
shares this privilege.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.652
For this honor,

19:10.785 --> 19:14.889
we live out our lives
in these palace walls.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.028
We take no husband.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.764
We will bear no children.

19:22.897 --> 19:24.732
Mahi women,

19:24.866 --> 19:27.702
no harm will come to you
for the sins of your men.

19:27.835 --> 19:31.639
I offer you and our people
a choice.

19:33.007 --> 19:36.844
Any woman who does not wish
to stay...

19:38.245 --> 19:39.947
May leave.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.841
I can't continue with this one.

20:06.974 --> 20:09.110
You're talking vodun.
You don't want to listen.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.578
No, you want to laugh.

20:12.880 --> 20:16.050
Do not touch
another warrior's weapon.

20:16.184 --> 20:19.319
Mm. Especially that one.

20:19.453 --> 20:21.288
It is cursed.

20:21.421 --> 20:24.491
Esi couldn't hit an elephant
in a stampede.

20:24.625 --> 20:26.127
Turn your back and see

20:26.259 --> 20:28.863
how true my aim is.
- Ah, me?

20:30.230 --> 20:31.298
Mm.

20:38.573 --> 20:40.541
Spent all my liberties
walking the river

20:40.675 --> 20:43.211
till I found
the perfect whetstone.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.246
Shaped smooth by the waterfall.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.649
Sharpens to a Thorn.

20:50.484 --> 20:53.320
Pop out their eyeballs,
fight is over.

20:55.089 --> 20:59.259
They are also useful in keeping
the trainees in line.

20:59.392 --> 21:00.595
Why have you not bathed?

21:00.728 --> 21:02.295
You are going to bring
the buzzards.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.899
- I let the others go before me.
- Ah.

21:05.032 --> 21:08.202
The first rule of training:

21:08.335 --> 21:11.438
Always obey izogie.

21:14.307 --> 21:17.410
I am izogie.

21:42.203 --> 21:44.272
I'm sorry.

21:44.404 --> 21:47.575
You may stay.

21:47.708 --> 21:50.410
You are one of
the captives we freed?

21:50.545 --> 21:52.513
No. My father brought me.

21:52.647 --> 21:54.347
As a gift to the king.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.084
Is your father rich?

21:57.218 --> 21:58.686
He must be.

21:58.820 --> 22:01.321
Otherwise, he would have
sold you to a rich husband.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.390
He tried.

22:03.524 --> 22:06.227
I do not want a husband.

22:06.359 --> 22:07.695
I want to be a soldier.

22:07.829 --> 22:10.298
- An agojie.
- How old are you?

22:10.430 --> 22:12.033
I have 19 years.

22:12.166 --> 22:13.400
You look like a child.

22:13.534 --> 22:15.269
I work hard.

22:15.402 --> 22:16.971
Harder than anyone.

22:17.104 --> 22:20.373
Many obstinate daughters
are dumped at the palace.

22:20.508 --> 22:22.944
They usually fail.

22:24.245 --> 22:25.980
All our lives, they...

22:26.113 --> 22:29.016
They tell us stories
about the agojie.

22:29.150 --> 22:30.618
That you have magic.

22:30.751 --> 22:34.622
You look like
a regular old woman to me.

22:37.558 --> 22:41.662
Fighting is not magic.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.165
It is skill.

22:44.298 --> 22:47.434
We will see if you have any.

23:00.447 --> 23:03.483
I am not a soldier.

23:03.618 --> 23:06.486
Then why did you stay?

23:06.621 --> 23:08.890
I have nowhere else to go.

23:11.325 --> 23:13.294
You are mahi.

23:13.426 --> 23:14.695
Why did you stay?

23:14.829 --> 23:19.100
Here, I will be the hunter,
not prey.

23:38.719 --> 23:41.856
Today, you are receiving
your first weapon.

23:55.468 --> 23:57.437
Not good.

24:00.473 --> 24:01.943
Ah, good.

24:06.147 --> 24:07.181
Again.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.184
A rope is not a weapon.

24:11.819 --> 24:14.555
You wish for a different weapon?

24:15.656 --> 24:17.692
Stand up.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.930
Go. Attack the soldier.
Take his head.

24:27.702 --> 24:30.538
- I apologize.
- Do not apologize. Do it.

25:00.634 --> 25:03.537
I'd work on that rope.

25:09.377 --> 25:11.712
Hey. Tsetse.

25:12.713 --> 25:14.315
Who's tsetse?

25:14.448 --> 25:15.783
You, little fly.

25:15.916 --> 25:18.886
Buzzing around full speed.

25:19.020 --> 25:21.389
But you don't know
where you are going.

25:21.522 --> 25:23.524
We need smart warriors.

25:23.657 --> 25:24.525
The dumb ones die quickly.

25:24.658 --> 25:26.360
I'm not dumb.

25:26.494 --> 25:27.561
-Then show me.

25:27.695 --> 25:29.497
You have to train different.

25:29.630 --> 25:31.932
The drills are a game.

25:32.066 --> 25:34.702
It is play,
like when you were a child.

25:34.835 --> 25:37.506
I was not allowed to play.

25:37.638 --> 25:39.173
I was made to work.

25:39.306 --> 25:41.475
Such a sad tale.

25:41.609 --> 25:43.210
You don't know anything.

25:48.983 --> 25:53.921
You know, when I had 14 years,

25:54.055 --> 25:57.691
my mother put a sign out
to sell my virginity.

25:58.659 --> 26:00.294
The first man came,

26:00.428 --> 26:03.764
and I cried for my mother,
but she didn't come.

26:03.898 --> 26:07.536
The second man came
and complained of my tears,

26:07.668 --> 26:09.136
so she beat me.

26:09.270 --> 26:13.908
The third man came,
and I burned him with an Ember.

26:17.078 --> 26:19.747
Your family was cruel,

26:19.880 --> 26:22.750
as was my mother.

26:22.883 --> 26:25.886
It is enough to make you cry.

26:26.821 --> 26:29.924
But it is better to laugh. Yes?

26:31.659 --> 26:34.295
You have a new family now.

26:39.934 --> 26:41.469
Trainees, we will prepare you

26:41.602 --> 26:43.070
for the final test.

26:43.204 --> 26:46.307
You will perform your
battle skills before the king.

26:47.808 --> 26:50.311
Those who pass the test

26:50.444 --> 26:51.846
will become agojie.

26:51.979 --> 26:55.517
And those who fail
will leave the palace,

26:55.649 --> 26:56.750
never to return.

27:00.988 --> 27:04.091
Hey, look at you.
The oyo will catch you,

27:04.225 --> 27:06.760
hang you by your feet
and cut your throat.

27:07.761 --> 27:09.864
Use your feet and walk!

27:28.983 --> 27:31.785
Get up.
You are just waiting to die.

27:35.723 --> 27:37.791
Are we training to cook?

27:37.925 --> 27:41.563
You are cutting a body,
not a yam.

27:41.695 --> 27:44.131
Swing with purpose.

27:51.805 --> 27:55.109
Ready. Fire!

28:00.080 --> 28:02.183
Good, ode.

28:02.316 --> 28:04.885
- Get out!
- Nawi, you move like a sloth.

28:10.858 --> 28:12.193
That's right.

28:13.928 --> 28:17.364
Dahomey!

28:19.568 --> 28:22.703
Izogie!

28:54.401 --> 28:58.739
Agojie!

29:07.982 --> 29:09.083
Fumbe.

29:09.216 --> 29:11.752
Show me how to tie the rope.

29:11.885 --> 29:14.054
Never.

29:14.188 --> 29:16.725
It is the only thing
I can do better than you.

29:16.857 --> 29:19.728
Ode, this one.

29:22.863 --> 29:24.733
But did you see izogie?

29:24.865 --> 29:26.867
With the dagger here.

29:27.001 --> 29:29.738
She's standing there,
not moving, not in pain.

29:29.870 --> 29:31.805
- Wow.
- I love it.

29:31.939 --> 29:33.774
I'm going to be like her.

29:33.907 --> 29:34.907
Yes, my friend.

29:35.009 --> 29:36.310
- As strong as her.
- Mm-hmm.

29:36.443 --> 29:38.546
You try to stab me,
I'll stab you back.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.814
Yeah.

29:40.948 --> 29:42.517
Backswing.

29:56.830 --> 30:00.535
Which of you designed
this trick?

30:03.605 --> 30:04.972
Hmm?

30:05.105 --> 30:07.642
- Then you will all be punished.
- I did it.

30:07.776 --> 30:10.077
- We all did it.
- No.

30:10.944 --> 30:12.647
It was me.

30:12.781 --> 30:13.847
I apologize.

30:13.981 --> 30:16.483
Once again.

30:17.918 --> 30:19.953
Go back to the barracks.

30:24.992 --> 30:28.429
How do you make this explosion?

30:29.631 --> 30:32.833
You do not need guns
to use gunpowder.

30:32.966 --> 30:34.968
We just need a spark.

30:35.903 --> 30:38.472
You like the guns?

30:38.606 --> 30:41.041
Do you enjoy practicing
with the men in the infantry?

30:41.175 --> 30:44.178
I see you flirting.

30:44.311 --> 30:46.514
- This is not allowed?
- You know it is not.

30:46.648 --> 30:48.015
Why not?

30:48.148 --> 30:50.851
The men who are soldiers
have wives and children,

30:50.984 --> 30:52.721
but the agojie cannot.

30:52.853 --> 30:54.288
How is that fair?

30:54.421 --> 30:56.156
Were you this arrogant
with your family?

30:56.290 --> 30:57.925
No wonder they gave you away.

30:58.058 --> 31:00.595
It is you who is arrogant.

31:01.929 --> 31:03.798
I am a general.

31:03.931 --> 31:04.998
I have earned it.

31:05.132 --> 31:06.835
You have earned nothing.

31:06.967 --> 31:08.102
I should put you out.

31:08.235 --> 31:09.870
- No.
- I have watched soldiers die

31:10.003 --> 31:12.106
because they did not
have discipline.

31:12.239 --> 31:13.842
Their easy life
did not prepare them for

31:13.974 --> 31:17.945
- this life here as an agojie.
- I did not have an easy life.

31:19.913 --> 31:22.684
I did not have an easy life.

31:22.817 --> 31:24.017
Please.

31:24.151 --> 31:25.953
I-I want to be here
with the others.

31:26.086 --> 31:28.188
I want to fight for my king.

31:30.457 --> 31:31.959
Please.

31:32.092 --> 31:36.463
Your tears mean nothing.

31:38.132 --> 31:41.402
To be a warrior,
you must kill your tears.

31:48.976 --> 31:50.512
Go.

31:51.813 --> 31:53.147
Ah.

32:01.488 --> 32:03.457
Go.

32:09.997 --> 32:11.566
Hey.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
You are a mahi prisoner.

32:14.101 --> 32:15.904
That is all you will ever be.

32:16.036 --> 32:18.338
What did you say?

32:18.472 --> 32:20.875
- She killed our people.
- You killed mine.

32:21.008 --> 32:24.011
Me, I also came here a captive.

32:24.144 --> 32:26.881
Do you think yourself
better than me?

32:27.014 --> 32:28.115
No, ajahi.

32:28.248 --> 32:30.585
If you make it
through the final test,

32:30.718 --> 32:33.020
you are one of us.

32:33.153 --> 32:36.056
No matter where you come from.

32:40.060 --> 32:42.062
Hmm.

32:46.901 --> 32:48.837
Hey, tsetse.

32:48.969 --> 32:49.970
Eat up.

32:50.103 --> 32:53.240
Nanisca favors the strong.

32:53.373 --> 32:56.343
What is the first rule
of training?

33:01.215 --> 33:03.651
Always obey izogie.

33:08.055 --> 33:09.990
Come with me.

33:13.595 --> 33:15.630
Drink.

33:15.763 --> 33:17.164
What is it?

33:17.297 --> 33:20.067
The only thing the white men
bring worth having.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.871
They call it whiskey.

33:24.404 --> 33:28.375
There. We finally found
a way to quiet tse.

33:28.510 --> 33:30.043
You know your tongue
will get you

33:30.177 --> 33:32.045
kicked back to your village.

33:32.179 --> 33:34.348
Why do you challenge
the miganon?

33:34.481 --> 33:36.518
If I'm quiet, she won't see me.

33:36.651 --> 33:39.219
Do you think she
has time to think about you?

33:39.353 --> 33:43.123
She is thinking about the world.

33:43.257 --> 33:46.026
You know she may one day
be the kpojito.

33:46.159 --> 33:48.095
- The woman king?
- Mm-hmm.

33:48.228 --> 33:51.064
But we have not had one
in so many years.

33:51.198 --> 33:53.166
His brother did not honor it,

33:53.300 --> 33:57.037
but king ghezo believes
in tradition.

33:57.170 --> 34:01.009
In the twin gods, mawu and Lisa.

34:01.141 --> 34:03.043
Woman and man.

34:03.176 --> 34:04.913
Equal.

34:05.045 --> 34:07.080
Ghezo will name a woman king.

34:07.214 --> 34:09.984
For the gods and the people.

34:10.117 --> 34:13.021
But is that what
the miganon wants?

34:13.152 --> 34:15.023
I cannot say.

34:15.188 --> 34:18.324
But in the palace,
she is a legend.

34:18.458 --> 34:21.061
Captured as a young soldier.

34:21.194 --> 34:23.063
Given up for dead.

34:23.196 --> 34:25.264
But she returned,

34:25.399 --> 34:30.038
with the oyo bastards' kofes
hanging by her belt.

34:54.929 --> 34:57.031
You know I hate that drink.

34:57.164 --> 35:00.034
The king drinks
anything I give him.

35:00.167 --> 35:01.401
The king is young.

35:01.536 --> 35:04.137
He brings that silly wife
to the council.

35:04.271 --> 35:06.406
Shante.

35:06.541 --> 35:11.345
Ah, she is ambitious, hmm?

35:20.320 --> 35:22.155
Tell me the dream, nani.

35:24.726 --> 35:29.797
It dispels its magic
if you say the words.

35:33.133 --> 35:35.069
I am in the jungle.

35:35.202 --> 35:37.270
Mm-hmm.

35:38.506 --> 35:43.210
Something is out there,
in the darkness.

35:45.178 --> 35:46.047
A beast.

35:46.179 --> 35:48.415
Angry.

35:53.286 --> 35:55.556
I can smell its sweat, its fear.

35:55.690 --> 35:58.693
What does the beast look like?

35:59.861 --> 36:01.395
I don't know.

36:01.529 --> 36:04.297
That is when I wake.

36:06.166 --> 36:07.935
The dream is a warning, no?

36:09.269 --> 36:11.204
We must ask legba.

36:11.338 --> 36:13.340
Oh, no. Not the nuts.

36:13.473 --> 36:16.110
Do not call them nuts.

36:18.245 --> 36:20.180
They are sacred.

36:28.288 --> 36:31.159
You have enemies gathering.

36:31.291 --> 36:32.894
You must do better than that.

36:36.396 --> 36:38.599
I see fire.

36:38.733 --> 36:44.172
Something or someone
from your past.

36:44.304 --> 36:47.075
This is nonsense.

36:47.207 --> 36:48.543
And your medicine, too.

36:48.676 --> 36:52.212
- I am not even tired.
- Go to the altar.

36:52.345 --> 36:55.449
Leave gifts for the dead.

36:57.284 --> 36:59.887
Do it.

37:00.021 --> 37:04.726
If you do not respect ifÃ¡,
respect your own dream.

39:28.636 --> 39:31.438
I am general oba Ade.

39:37.144 --> 39:41.716
The esteemed regard
of the king of oyo.

39:41.849 --> 39:46.621
Gifts for the oyo kingdom,
as is tradition.

39:47.454 --> 39:49.523
Nanisca.

39:57.430 --> 39:58.542
This is less than ever before.

39:58.566 --> 40:00.601
Did you think we would not see?

40:00.735 --> 40:02.370
Did you think we would
not see your hand

40:02.503 --> 40:04.572
in the raid of our village?

40:06.406 --> 40:08.643
To make up for
your shortcomings,

40:08.776 --> 40:11.411
I will accept an addition
to the tribute.

40:11.545 --> 40:13.180
40 agojie.

40:15.216 --> 40:17.785
Not too old.

40:19.620 --> 40:21.822
- And if I refuse?
- Then you may no longer

40:21.956 --> 40:23.436
use the port in ouidah
for your trade.

40:23.557 --> 40:25.326
The port belongs to dahomey.

40:25.458 --> 40:27.460
We have taken control.

40:27.595 --> 40:29.196
It belongs to us now.

40:33.401 --> 40:36.370
I'm so surprised you brought
your horses here to plateau.

40:36.504 --> 40:38.539
If they are bitten by the flies,

40:38.673 --> 40:42.143
they may get
the sleeping sickness.

40:42.276 --> 40:46.446
Sometimes a mouse
can take down an elephant.

40:46.580 --> 40:48.616
Do you threaten the oyo,
usurper?

40:48.749 --> 40:50.751
You will respect the king.

40:52.653 --> 40:54.487
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. Migan.

40:54.622 --> 40:56.557
This new general seeks
to bait us.

40:56.691 --> 40:59.226
We won't jump
at his foolishness.

40:59.360 --> 41:01.494
Let us talk.

41:15.943 --> 41:20.181
20 agojie of our choosing.

41:20.314 --> 41:23.651
We will march them to ouidah
and surrender them.

41:23.784 --> 41:26.087
And the port remains open
for our trade.

41:27.421 --> 41:28.756
I will leave boma

41:28.889 --> 41:30.758
to enjoy the feast
that you have prepared.

41:30.891 --> 41:35.029
In ouidah, I will be waiting.

41:36.097 --> 41:37.231
Oba.

43:03.417 --> 43:04.885
Nanisca.

43:07.621 --> 43:08.789
What happened?

43:08.923 --> 43:12.226
Your nuts were finally right.

45:04.872 --> 45:06.040
Agojie.

45:06.173 --> 45:08.842
Agojie's here.

45:13.180 --> 45:15.584
Hey, a deal's a deal!

45:42.810 --> 45:46.113
We bring tribute
from king ghezo.

45:46.247 --> 45:49.651
Dahomey has no soldiers
man enough.

45:49.783 --> 45:52.753
They have to use their women.

45:53.787 --> 45:55.356
It is against the gods.

45:56.991 --> 45:59.661
My men will find plenty
of use for them.

45:59.793 --> 46:01.929
You're mistaken.

46:02.062 --> 46:04.798
These soldiers
are not your tribute.

46:04.932 --> 46:07.234
This is your tribute.

46:08.068 --> 46:10.505
Let it be known to all

46:10.639 --> 46:15.109
the great and mighty king ghezo
fears no one.

46:25.986 --> 46:29.490
- Oyo!
- Oyo!

47:06.160 --> 47:08.829
Li-lift the gate!

47:22.943 --> 47:25.446
Miganon!

47:25.580 --> 47:26.781
Go!

47:32.654 --> 47:34.589
Go! Go!

48:17.898 --> 48:20.134
Push off.

48:30.010 --> 48:32.012
Why did you not follow the plan?

48:32.146 --> 48:33.748
You were to go to the boats.

48:33.882 --> 48:35.048
The soldiers were coming.

48:35.182 --> 48:36.885
If I did not come back
as I did...

48:37.017 --> 48:38.385
So you are the hero?

48:38.520 --> 48:41.455
You can act on your own,
ignoring orders?

48:41.589 --> 48:44.692
- You would not have escaped.
- Nawi.

48:48.429 --> 48:51.699
It is you who faced capture
by disobeying my orders.

48:56.838 --> 48:58.807
We are agojie.

48:58.939 --> 49:00.307
We do not act alone.

49:00.441 --> 49:02.610
We move together
with one purpose.

49:02.744 --> 49:04.244
Alone, you are weak.

49:04.378 --> 49:07.147
Alone, you are killed or worse.

49:08.182 --> 49:10.984
Now you have seen
the barracoons.

49:11.118 --> 49:14.087
A captured agojie is a slave.

49:15.022 --> 49:16.791
Used by men.

49:16.925 --> 49:19.159
Left to rot.

49:20.862 --> 49:23.865
It is better to die.

49:23.997 --> 49:25.999
Cut your own throat.

49:32.640 --> 49:35.510
I will never question you
in front of the others,

49:35.643 --> 49:38.045
but it is you who did not
follow the plan.

49:38.178 --> 49:41.148
I only ever had one plan,
amenza.

49:41.281 --> 49:42.884
To take his head.

49:43.016 --> 49:45.319
Nanisca, I...

50:10.043 --> 50:11.713
Nanisca.

50:11.846 --> 50:13.213
Come in.

50:18.352 --> 50:20.755
I hear you have had a victory.

50:23.758 --> 50:27.361
Nanisca, I think we have
started on a wrong foot.

50:27.494 --> 50:29.597
I wish to be your friend.

50:29.731 --> 50:32.266
I can help you.
I have the king's ear.

50:32.399 --> 50:34.234
We should work together
to serve our king.

50:34.368 --> 50:36.403
To ensure he grows
only more powerful.

50:36.538 --> 50:39.439
It is you who wants
to be powerful.

50:39.574 --> 50:44.111
To stay safe and rich
in your fine palace.

50:45.647 --> 50:48.282
Too much change
can be dangerous.

50:48.415 --> 50:50.818
I have said this much
to my husband.

50:50.952 --> 50:55.489
Then we will soon understand
who truly has his ear.

51:11.606 --> 51:14.509
This field alone produces

51:14.642 --> 51:17.110
thousands of barrels
of palm oil.

51:17.244 --> 51:19.647
If we harvest many fields
each year,

51:19.781 --> 51:22.850
we will have a continuous
supply to trade.

51:22.984 --> 51:24.084
Hmm.

51:24.217 --> 51:27.354
I never saw a path before,
nanisca.

51:28.388 --> 51:30.024
But look at this.

51:30.190 --> 51:31.626
Now I do.

51:31.759 --> 51:35.228
Vision is seeing
what others do not.

51:35.362 --> 51:37.264
But now we have declared war.

51:37.397 --> 51:40.001
We will conquer the oyo,

51:40.133 --> 51:42.704
and we will expand our land.

51:42.837 --> 51:45.773
Nanisca, we will be
the greatest empire in Africa.

51:45.907 --> 51:49.142
Yes, my king,
but let us not be an empire

51:49.276 --> 51:51.445
who sells its people.

51:51.579 --> 51:54.147
Let us be an empire
who loves its people.

51:54.281 --> 51:57.184
My brother sold our own.

51:57.317 --> 51:58.920
I will never do that.

51:59.053 --> 52:03.958
Even if they are not dahomey,
they are still our people.

52:04.092 --> 52:06.828
The white man has brought
immorality here.

52:06.961 --> 52:09.229
They will not stop
until the whole of Africa

52:09.363 --> 52:11.532
is theirs to enslave.

52:12.232 --> 52:14.035
Go.

52:18.840 --> 52:22.043
The English Navy
now patrols the waters,

52:22.175 --> 52:23.945
attacks and removes our cargo.

52:24.078 --> 52:26.814
Your tribal warfare
is none of my concern.

52:26.948 --> 52:29.249
And yours with dahomey
is none of ours.

52:29.383 --> 52:32.553
It will be over soon enough.

52:32.687 --> 52:35.657
The mahi, the igbo,
they are with us.

52:35.790 --> 52:39.027
By the full moon,
we will march on their city,

52:39.159 --> 52:40.494
and we will take it.

52:40.628 --> 52:43.397
Ouidah is open for business.

52:43.531 --> 52:45.465
You will have your cargo.

54:50.258 --> 54:52.260
Go back to ouidah, slaver.

54:52.392 --> 54:55.229
Naked like the people you sell.

54:55.362 --> 54:56.463
I am not a slaver.

54:56.597 --> 54:58.365
You understand me?

54:58.498 --> 55:01.501
My mother was dahomey.

55:02.502 --> 55:04.437
You do not look like dahomey.

55:04.572 --> 55:08.209
My father is white.

55:08.341 --> 55:11.646
So you are dahomey but not.

55:12.345 --> 55:13.981
And white...

55:14.115 --> 55:16.617
But not.

55:18.786 --> 55:22.089
You think I could
have my pants now?

55:27.427 --> 55:30.330
I saw you in ouidah.

55:30.463 --> 55:32.365
Why are you here in the jungle?

55:32.499 --> 55:35.303
I am going to dahomey.

55:35.435 --> 55:38.940
The place my mother told me
so much about.

55:39.073 --> 55:42.375
Perhaps I will
see you there, too.

55:42.510 --> 55:45.345
If you are allowed
into the palace.

56:10.504 --> 56:12.573
I am Malik.

56:13.473 --> 56:15.408
Malik!

56:34.028 --> 56:37.231
I do not like
this young captain.

56:37.365 --> 56:39.333
Puffed up like a banty rooster.

56:39.466 --> 56:40.601
Finally, we agree.

56:53.047 --> 56:55.482
So you are now a captain, eh?

56:55.616 --> 56:56.684
<i>- Si.</i>
- Very good.

57:01.789 --> 57:03.791
Well done.

57:10.430 --> 57:13.034
You have my thanks.

57:23.511 --> 57:26.347
My mother was also taken.

57:26.479 --> 57:28.749
Sold by my brother.

57:28.883 --> 57:31.319
I have many men in your country
searching for her,

57:31.451 --> 57:33.387
and they will bring her back.

57:33.521 --> 57:35.122
It is a must.

57:35.256 --> 57:38.359
And, uh, if they find
your mother,

57:38.491 --> 57:40.394
they will bring her back, too.

57:40.528 --> 57:42.196
I have just buried her.

57:42.330 --> 57:45.633
It was her dying wish
that I come to her home.

57:45.766 --> 57:47.969
The only place
she was ever free.

57:49.270 --> 57:51.272
This is your home.

57:51.405 --> 57:53.407
It is yours, eh?

57:53.541 --> 57:56.210
And you came on the right day.

57:56.344 --> 57:57.645
Our magnificent agojie,

57:57.778 --> 57:59.479
they are doing their final test.

57:59.613 --> 58:01.515
So please sit, eh?

58:01.649 --> 58:03.483
Go. Go on, sit. Go.

58:03.617 --> 58:06.020
Prepare the seats for them.

58:09.190 --> 58:10.891
Very good.

58:11.592 --> 58:13.027
Let us begin.

58:17.565 --> 58:19.100
Go.

58:38.352 --> 58:40.087
Fear not.

58:40.221 --> 58:41.655
Face it head-on.

58:41.789 --> 58:44.592
Relentlessly, we will fight.

59:17.258 --> 59:18.459
Fumbe.

59:22.663 --> 59:26.133
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Come!

59:28.936 --> 59:31.439
Come. Come. Come.

59:31.572 --> 59:33.274
Come.

59:33.407 --> 59:35.309
Come. Come.

59:35.443 --> 59:36.545
Come.

01:00:15.883 --> 01:00:18.219
Yeah!

01:00:52.086 --> 01:00:55.624
Yeah!

01:01:04.231 --> 01:01:06.700
Come.
Come, come, come, come, come.

01:01:06.834 --> 01:01:08.769
Come, my dear.
Come, come, come.

01:01:13.707 --> 01:01:14.775
What is your name?

01:01:14.909 --> 01:01:16.343
I am nawi, my king.

01:01:16.477 --> 01:01:17.678
Nawi.

01:01:17.811 --> 01:01:20.147
You are beautiful
as you are fierce.

01:01:21.482 --> 01:01:23.217
If she was not so skilled,
I would have

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:25.953
made her a wife, now.

01:01:29.823 --> 01:01:31.392
To the Victor!

01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:39.166
The gods will bless you.
The gods will keep you safe.

01:01:44.805 --> 01:01:46.907
Well done to all of you.

01:01:47.041 --> 01:01:50.579
You are the strongest
warriors in Africa.

01:01:50.711 --> 01:01:52.614
Welcome to the king's guard.

01:02:05.859 --> 01:02:06.994
Agojie!

01:02:07.127 --> 01:02:08.697
- Wu suu!
- Agojie!

01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:10.599
- Wu suu!
- Agojie!

01:02:10.731 --> 01:02:12.634
Wu suu!

01:02:17.004 --> 01:02:20.107
Hey, be still.

01:02:21.308 --> 01:02:23.811
Thank you.

01:02:23.944 --> 01:02:26.548
Why did you return
to help fumbe?

01:02:26.681 --> 01:02:27.748
You could have lost.

01:02:27.881 --> 01:02:29.551
Fumbe is my friend.

01:02:29.684 --> 01:02:30.751
I want her to stay.

01:02:30.884 --> 01:02:32.753
To stay, she must pass the test.

01:02:32.886 --> 01:02:36.223
To be useful,
she must stand on her own.

01:02:38.125 --> 01:02:40.227
You would not help
your friend, miganon?

01:02:40.361 --> 01:02:41.395
Amenza?

01:02:41.529 --> 01:02:45.032
I would step on her head
to win a footrace.

01:02:48.902 --> 01:02:50.639
Ah, your first scars.

01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:52.906
The Mark of a warrior.

01:02:53.841 --> 01:02:55.710
You see?

01:02:55.843 --> 01:02:57.778
Hmm?

01:02:57.911 --> 01:03:00.347
You will have many more.

01:03:03.317 --> 01:03:04.451
Hmm?

01:03:05.587 --> 01:03:07.288
Hmm?

01:03:10.725 --> 01:03:12.793
Make sure...

01:03:12.926 --> 01:03:14.596
All the thorns come out.

01:03:14.729 --> 01:03:15.796
Here, here.

01:03:15.929 --> 01:03:17.464
- Mm-hmm.
- Here.

01:03:17.599 --> 01:03:18.700
Mm-hmm.

01:03:18.832 --> 01:03:20.602
Here.

01:03:20.735 --> 01:03:23.137
What is this?

01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:27.374
Uh, my father used to call it
the devil's Mark.

01:03:27.509 --> 01:03:31.078
It was there when he chose me
from the orphanage.

01:03:31.945 --> 01:03:34.014
You are an orphan?

01:03:35.883 --> 01:03:37.752
But your father...

01:03:37.885 --> 01:03:39.453
He took me in.

01:03:39.587 --> 01:03:42.823
I guess I didn't turn out
to be the daughter he wanted.

01:04:05.913 --> 01:04:07.582
Nani?

01:04:13.153 --> 01:04:16.357
- What did you do with it?
- With what?

01:04:22.896 --> 01:04:24.131
You told me never to tell you.

01:04:24.264 --> 01:04:26.867
- I'm asking.
- You said you would ask,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.936
- and you made me swear.
- Amenza!

01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:34.576
I am not your servant, nanisca.

01:04:45.919 --> 01:04:47.321
I gave her to the missionaries.

01:04:47.454 --> 01:04:49.533
- What missionaries?
- The ones we passed on the road

01:04:49.557 --> 01:04:51.434
when we were marching.
- Where did they take her?

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:53.828
- I have no way to know that.
- What direction did they go?

01:04:53.961 --> 01:04:56.798
I followed your order...

01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:59.768
To free you of the burden...

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.902
And I chose to give her away.

01:05:02.035 --> 01:05:03.705
- And that is all you know?
- Yes!

01:05:03.838 --> 01:05:05.472
I do not lie to you.

01:05:07.474 --> 01:05:11.646
Why do you ask these questions
after all this time?

01:05:13.981 --> 01:05:17.685
Because nawi is an orphan?

01:05:19.621 --> 01:05:23.591
You couldn't possibly think
that sh-she...

01:05:26.795 --> 01:05:28.596
Of course not.

01:05:29.764 --> 01:05:31.465
No.

01:05:42.009 --> 01:05:45.647
The gods are not that cruel.

01:05:53.688 --> 01:05:57.057
Speak my language
when you are in my palace.

01:05:59.092 --> 01:06:00.394
Your wife shante,

01:06:00.528 --> 01:06:03.464
she said you seek
an end to the trade.

01:06:04.998 --> 01:06:06.734
She does not speak for me.

01:06:06.868 --> 01:06:09.970
And she will be punished
for thinking she does.

01:06:11.405 --> 01:06:13.808
She says this is
your general's wish

01:06:13.942 --> 01:06:14.975
and perhaps not yours.

01:06:15.108 --> 01:06:17.311
My generals obey my wishes.

01:06:17.444 --> 01:06:21.014
So you wish to sell...
Palm oil.

01:06:21.148 --> 01:06:23.885
I wish for my people to prosper,

01:06:24.017 --> 01:06:25.352
as those of your land do.

01:06:25.486 --> 01:06:29.189
Ghezo, the people in my lands
prosper

01:06:29.323 --> 01:06:32.392
because of the slave trade.

01:06:32.527 --> 01:06:35.229
And this very same trade
has made you rich.

01:06:35.362 --> 01:06:39.233
As rich as the king of england.

01:06:39.366 --> 01:06:43.972
You stop the trade,
you will be nothing.

01:06:44.104 --> 01:06:46.608
King, maybe, but...

01:06:46.741 --> 01:06:48.242
King of mud.

01:06:48.375 --> 01:06:52.112
All of these captains will take
their business elsewhere.

01:06:52.246 --> 01:06:55.449
The business
of selling africans?

01:06:56.818 --> 01:06:59.319
You will be unprotected.

01:07:00.053 --> 01:07:02.790
Unprotected?

01:07:04.124 --> 01:07:06.928
Ooh.

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:08.730
You know, I am under no illusion

01:07:08.863 --> 01:07:13.701
that you see us
as anything but a commodity.

01:07:16.103 --> 01:07:19.139
But I am a king.

01:07:19.273 --> 01:07:22.744
With or without your respect.

01:07:22.877 --> 01:07:27.949
And if you are no longer
a necessity to me,

01:07:28.081 --> 01:07:32.085
you, too, are unprotected.

01:07:37.157 --> 01:07:38.826
Yeah!

01:07:51.071 --> 01:07:52.540
Malik.

01:07:56.044 --> 01:07:57.979
Nawi.

01:07:58.111 --> 01:08:00.280
- May I come in?
- No.

01:08:00.414 --> 01:08:03.283
No man may cross the palm line.

01:08:03.417 --> 01:08:06.253
In Brazil, foreign men may look
on the king's women?

01:08:06.386 --> 01:08:09.924
In Brazil,
women cover their bodies

01:08:10.058 --> 01:08:12.326
with long sleeves, long skirts.

01:08:12.459 --> 01:08:14.729
Then how do they run?

01:08:18.066 --> 01:08:20.133
Yes? Make sure that...

01:08:20.267 --> 01:08:22.870
We make camp
outside the walls tonight.

01:08:23.004 --> 01:08:24.005
Come to see me.

01:08:24.136 --> 01:08:26.674
Tonight, we take our blood oath.

01:08:26.808 --> 01:08:28.676
Afterward.

01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:31.310
If you wish for a girl
to come to your tent,

01:08:31.444 --> 01:08:33.085
there are girls
you can pay in the market.

01:08:33.145 --> 01:08:37.250
No, no, I-I just want
to talk to you.

01:08:37.384 --> 01:08:40.153
Malik!

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:45.792
Will you come to see me?

01:09:35.175 --> 01:09:36.944
Agojie!

01:09:38.245 --> 01:09:40.048
Blood of our sisters.

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:44.250
âª Make us invincible âª

01:09:47.121 --> 01:09:48.121
âª you live for me âª

01:09:49.524 --> 01:09:51.191
âª and I for you âª

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:54.896
âª blood of our sisters âª

01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:57.999
âª make us invincible âª

01:10:03.336 --> 01:10:05.106
âª You live for me
and I for you âª

01:10:06.774 --> 01:10:08.341
âª you live for me
and I for you âª

01:10:08.475 --> 01:10:11.012
âª agojie âª

01:10:16.184 --> 01:10:18.251
You are now my sister.

01:10:18.385 --> 01:10:20.922
I will be proud
to fight with you.

01:10:21.055 --> 01:10:22.557
I want you to teach me.

01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:24.759
Like the miganon teaches you.

01:10:24.892 --> 01:10:28.196
I also want to be great.

01:10:28.328 --> 01:10:31.632
To be great, you must focus.

01:10:31.766 --> 01:10:34.102
There can be no distractions.

01:10:34.234 --> 01:10:35.570
I will.

01:10:37.171 --> 01:10:42.476
At the test, I saw the man
from Brazil wave to you.

01:10:43.343 --> 01:10:45.312
You know this man?

01:10:45.445 --> 01:10:49.217
I... I came across him
in the jungle.

01:10:49.349 --> 01:10:51.886
"In the jungle."

01:10:53.554 --> 01:10:55.757
So, what,
you have feelings for him?

01:10:55.890 --> 01:10:59.660
I have no way to know
how I feel about him.

01:11:01.328 --> 01:11:03.430
You want me to teach you.

01:11:07.467 --> 01:11:09.503
You are powerful.

01:11:09.637 --> 01:11:12.140
More than you even know.

01:11:12.272 --> 01:11:15.042
Do not give your power away.

01:11:15.176 --> 01:11:16.811
Hmm?

01:11:18.613 --> 01:11:20.214
You mean to love?

01:11:20.347 --> 01:11:23.050
Love makes you weak.

01:11:23.184 --> 01:11:25.052
You really believe that?

01:11:27.555 --> 01:11:29.857
You have never loved?

01:11:31.358 --> 01:11:34.327
I will be miganon one day.

01:11:36.197 --> 01:11:38.498
You cannot have both.

01:11:38.633 --> 01:11:40.367
Will that be enough?

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.538
This is the life we have chosen.

01:11:43.671 --> 01:11:46.207
We each survive in our own way.

01:11:46.339 --> 01:11:48.676
You will find yours.

01:12:02.489 --> 01:12:04.424
My mother was a slave.

01:12:04.559 --> 01:12:07.195
That is all I ever knew
of African people.

01:12:07.327 --> 01:12:11.065
I never dreamed that we were...

01:12:11.199 --> 01:12:15.069
Kings and warriors.

01:12:17.337 --> 01:12:20.107
But now...

01:12:20.241 --> 01:12:22.543
I see the majesty.

01:12:23.644 --> 01:12:25.546
I see the beauty.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:28.683
I think you are a good man.

01:12:28.816 --> 01:12:32.220
You must not ally yourself
with slavers.

01:12:32.352 --> 01:12:33.988
We grew up together.

01:12:34.121 --> 01:12:37.390
But does he see our beauty
as you do?

01:12:47.335 --> 01:12:49.402
Nawi, the oyo are coming.

01:12:49.537 --> 01:12:50.638
We are ready.

01:12:50.771 --> 01:12:53.174
No, not just the oyo.

01:12:53.307 --> 01:12:55.343
Other tribes, too.

01:12:55.475 --> 01:12:58.346
I heard the general plotting.

01:12:58.478 --> 01:13:00.948
We must tell the miganon.

01:13:01.082 --> 01:13:02.250
I must get back.

01:13:02.382 --> 01:13:03.885
Nawi, wait.

01:13:04.018 --> 01:13:07.121
Tomorrow, we are going to leave.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.637
This is ogou.

01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:24.639
He is courage and strength.

01:13:24.772 --> 01:13:27.808
Perhaps he will bring you
back to us.

01:13:30.645 --> 01:13:33.614
I have nothing to give to you.

01:13:53.433 --> 01:13:56.537
I will take you back.

01:14:14.588 --> 01:14:16.590
Miganon.

01:14:19.492 --> 01:14:21.062
I have heard something.

01:14:21.195 --> 01:14:23.397
One of the men that came
to the palace,

01:14:23.531 --> 01:14:24.932
Malik, he says the oyo general

01:14:25.066 --> 01:14:27.401
is growing his army
with other tribes.

01:14:27.535 --> 01:14:29.370
They will march on dahomey.

01:14:29.502 --> 01:14:32.606
The oyo have given them courage.

01:14:34.408 --> 01:14:39.479
Where were you speaking
with this man, Malik?

01:14:39.613 --> 01:14:41.182
He spoke to me
through the palm line.

01:14:41.315 --> 01:14:43.651
On the night you swear loyalty
to your sisters,

01:14:43.784 --> 01:14:46.486
you speak in secret
with a slaver?

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:47.487
He's not a slaver.

01:14:47.621 --> 01:14:49.457
His mother was dahomey.

01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:52.360
You defend him?

01:14:52.526 --> 01:14:55.096
Is that knife a gift?

01:14:56.664 --> 01:14:59.000
Where have you been?

01:14:59.133 --> 01:15:01.936
- I have been nowhere.
- Come here.

01:15:04.138 --> 01:15:05.539
Here.

01:15:18.686 --> 01:15:21.022
You are an agojie.

01:15:21.856 --> 01:15:23.891
You cannot be with a man.

01:15:24.025 --> 01:15:27.628
Do you think you are so special
that I will not put you out?

01:15:27.762 --> 01:15:28.829
Because I will.

01:15:28.963 --> 01:15:30.564
I do not think I am special.

01:15:30.698 --> 01:15:32.299
Do not bow your head.

01:15:32.433 --> 01:15:34.568
Do not.

01:15:35.503 --> 01:15:37.071
I know your arrogance.

01:15:37.204 --> 01:15:39.206
You continue to do
as you please.

01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:40.408
You disregard the rules.

01:15:40.541 --> 01:15:42.676
What do you want from me?

01:15:43.611 --> 01:15:45.346
I proved myself today.

01:15:45.479 --> 01:15:46.480
I am the best.

01:15:46.614 --> 01:15:49.450
It is not enough to be the best.

01:15:49.583 --> 01:15:52.586
Your arrogance and your
stupidity will get you caught.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.588
I am not you.

01:15:54.722 --> 01:15:56.457
Izogie told me
that you were captured.

01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:57.992
That will never be me!

01:15:58.125 --> 01:16:00.961
I was raped many times
each night.

01:16:04.031 --> 01:16:08.302
When they would come,
I wished only to die.

01:16:10.404 --> 01:16:12.406
They took it all away.

01:16:12.541 --> 01:16:15.176
Everything I knew.

01:16:15.309 --> 01:16:19.313
And when I finally escaped,
I was with child.

01:16:19.447 --> 01:16:22.750
A child of those men.

01:16:22.883 --> 01:16:25.786
I would have to leave
my sisters forever,

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.255
so I had to hide.

01:16:29.457 --> 01:16:31.225
I bathed alone.

01:16:31.358 --> 01:16:33.327
And my belly grew.

01:16:48.242 --> 01:16:49.777
It was a girl.

01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:53.447
I told amenza, "take it away."

01:16:53.582 --> 01:16:58.385
But the blood, it kept coming,
and amenza ran away

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:01.789
to find medicine,
and she left me with her.

01:17:04.559 --> 01:17:06.827
So I did something.

01:17:35.356 --> 01:17:36.591
I made a cut

01:17:36.724 --> 01:17:38.993
on the back of the left arm,

01:17:39.126 --> 01:17:42.496
and I pressed a tooth into it.

01:17:42.631 --> 01:17:44.765
A shark's tooth.

01:17:51.672 --> 01:17:53.807
It isn't me.

01:20:04.773 --> 01:20:07.875
They are a day's
journey from our plateau.

01:20:08.008 --> 01:20:10.811
They will set up camp there.

01:20:11.979 --> 01:20:13.682
They expect us
to defend ourselves

01:20:13.814 --> 01:20:15.617
from behind our walls.

01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:17.184
We are greatly outnumbered.

01:20:17.318 --> 01:20:21.422
Their size makes them
arrogant and slow,

01:20:21.556 --> 01:20:23.324
like their guns.

01:20:38.172 --> 01:20:41.942
But you don't need a gun
to use gunpowder.

01:20:43.043 --> 01:20:46.681
You just need a spark.

01:20:46.815 --> 01:20:52.186
Sometimes a termite
can take down an elephant.

01:20:53.153 --> 01:20:56.725
We will bring the war to them.

01:21:01.563 --> 01:21:02.731
Agojie!

01:21:54.582 --> 01:21:57.117
For 90 years,

01:21:57.251 --> 01:22:00.789
dahomey has lived
under the thumb of the oyo!

01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:03.725
When it rains,

01:22:03.858 --> 01:22:07.562
our ancestors weep
for the pain we have felt

01:22:07.695 --> 01:22:12.634
in the dark hulls of ships
bound for distant shores!

01:22:15.102 --> 01:22:17.438
When the wind blows,

01:22:17.572 --> 01:22:20.941
our ancestors push us
to march into battle

01:22:21.074 --> 01:22:23.110
against those who enslave us!

01:22:23.243 --> 01:22:25.713
When it thunders,

01:22:25.847 --> 01:22:30.984
our ancestors demand
we rip the shackles of doubt

01:22:31.118 --> 01:22:33.287
from our minds
and fight with courage!

01:22:34.988 --> 01:22:39.026
We fight not just for today
but for the future!

01:22:39.928 --> 01:22:44.264
We are the spear of victory!

01:22:44.398 --> 01:22:47.067
We are the blade of freedom!

01:22:47.968 --> 01:22:51.004
We are dahomey!

01:22:51.138 --> 01:22:52.005
Agojie!

01:22:52.139 --> 01:22:53.608
- Wu suu!
- Agojie!

01:22:53.741 --> 01:22:54.809
Wu suu!

01:22:54.943 --> 01:22:56.544
- Agojie!
- Wu suu!

01:22:56.678 --> 01:22:57.745
Agojie!

01:22:57.879 --> 01:22:59.413
- Wu suu!
- Agojie!

01:22:59.547 --> 01:23:00.615
Wu suu!

01:24:15.122 --> 01:24:18.191
We are under attack! Attack!

01:24:26.834 --> 01:24:28.736
Grab your weapons!

01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:30.838
We are oyo!

01:24:31.973 --> 01:24:33.073
Oyo!

01:28:21.334 --> 01:28:23.070
Where is oba?

01:28:25.573 --> 01:28:27.208
Where is oba?!

01:28:41.055 --> 01:28:43.090
Fall back!

01:28:43.224 --> 01:28:45.358
Fall back! Oyo, fall back!

01:29:18.826 --> 01:29:20.528
Grab the agojie.

01:29:20.661 --> 01:29:23.331
Oyo, move!

01:29:23.463 --> 01:29:25.299
Oba wants the agojie.

01:29:25.432 --> 01:29:27.702
Move, move, move!

01:29:42.449 --> 01:29:43.784
They are retreating!

01:29:43.918 --> 01:29:46.587
Move, move, move!

01:30:10.511 --> 01:30:14.749
You fought well,
my young sister.

01:30:18.586 --> 01:30:20.988
Now you must rest.

01:30:26.794 --> 01:30:30.097
Ghezo! Wu suu!

01:30:33.367 --> 01:30:35.369
She is not here.

01:30:35.502 --> 01:30:38.039
No one has seen her.

01:31:21.649 --> 01:31:23.184
Fumbe.

01:31:24.352 --> 01:31:25.419
I failed.

01:31:25.553 --> 01:31:26.553
No.

01:31:26.654 --> 01:31:28.723
You stayed alive.

01:31:31.926 --> 01:31:34.061
You are not tied to anyone.

01:31:34.195 --> 01:31:35.396
Mm-mm.

01:31:35.529 --> 01:31:37.031
Go over.

01:31:38.699 --> 01:31:41.202
Do you want to live?

01:31:44.305 --> 01:31:46.140
Now.

01:32:06.894 --> 01:32:09.430
We need to buy passage.

01:32:09.563 --> 01:32:10.631
We are not going home?

01:32:10.765 --> 01:32:12.299
We have lost.

01:32:12.433 --> 01:32:15.569
At home, we are dead men.

01:32:17.605 --> 01:32:19.473
Put this one on display.

01:32:19.607 --> 01:32:23.010
The bids will be higher
for soldiers.

01:32:27.681 --> 01:32:29.483
Move.

01:32:29.617 --> 01:32:31.152
I said move.

01:32:53.707 --> 01:32:55.544
Move back!

01:32:55.676 --> 01:32:58.879
Make space for one more.

01:33:13.994 --> 01:33:17.031
Izogie.

01:33:18.799 --> 01:33:21.202
Come. Sit.

01:33:21.335 --> 01:33:23.170
Sit.

01:33:35.716 --> 01:33:36.917
Eat.

01:33:37.051 --> 01:33:40.020
We will need our strength
to escape.

01:33:43.757 --> 01:33:45.527
My arm is broken.

01:33:45.659 --> 01:33:48.262
I know what I must do.

01:33:49.797 --> 01:33:52.032
What the miganon said.

01:33:54.034 --> 01:33:56.737
We will slit our throats.

01:33:58.305 --> 01:34:00.307
We will not.

01:34:02.511 --> 01:34:03.512
"Fear not.

01:34:03.644 --> 01:34:06.113
"Face it head-on.

01:34:08.182 --> 01:34:11.719
Relentlessly, we will fight."

01:34:13.622 --> 01:34:14.755
Hey.

01:34:14.889 --> 01:34:17.592
You are izogie.

01:34:17.725 --> 01:34:19.660
You said it.

01:34:19.793 --> 01:34:22.830
"Relentlessly, we will fight."

01:34:23.797 --> 01:34:25.166
Come on!

01:34:45.719 --> 01:34:47.922
Push it back together.

01:35:13.914 --> 01:35:16.951
You are strong for a little fly.

01:35:27.629 --> 01:35:29.430
Now what?

01:35:57.391 --> 01:35:59.594
They were
taking us to the barracoons.

01:35:59.728 --> 01:36:01.795
How many others?

01:36:01.929 --> 01:36:03.565
Uh, three, I think.

01:36:03.698 --> 01:36:05.933
- Izogie?
- Uh...

01:36:06.066 --> 01:36:07.801
I did not see her.

01:36:09.203 --> 01:36:11.606
Nawi said to throw myself
off the wagon.

01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:13.907
Nawi?

01:36:18.912 --> 01:36:21.048
Miganon, ajahi.

01:36:21.181 --> 01:36:23.350
The king requests you.

01:36:23.484 --> 01:36:27.187
I have brought you here
because I have chosen kpojito.

01:36:27.321 --> 01:36:30.257
Kpojito is beloved
of the people.

01:36:30.391 --> 01:36:34.261
She must be deserving of their
admiration and their trust.

01:36:34.395 --> 01:36:38.767
We must share the same vision
for our future.

01:36:38.899 --> 01:36:40.067
A bold future.

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:44.805
For that reason,
I have chosen nanisca.

01:36:48.942 --> 01:36:50.377
She is a common soldier.

01:36:50.512 --> 01:36:52.122
- Will you sit down.
- Ruined by the enemy.

01:36:52.146 --> 01:36:54.815
- Sit down and be quiet!
- Shante.

01:36:57.418 --> 01:37:01.889
Kelu, efe, go and talk to her.
Go, go, go.

01:37:03.123 --> 01:37:05.192
We will celebrate.

01:37:05.326 --> 01:37:07.194
We will bring the city
to the palace,

01:37:07.328 --> 01:37:08.896
and we will have a big feast.

01:37:09.029 --> 01:37:10.931
Go and prepare.

01:37:17.004 --> 01:37:19.039
Well done.

01:37:32.019 --> 01:37:34.988
My king, it is a great honor.

01:37:35.122 --> 01:37:37.257
But perhaps it is too soon,

01:37:37.391 --> 01:37:39.126
when we have lost
so many soldiers

01:37:39.259 --> 01:37:40.861
and the people are grieving.

01:37:40.994 --> 01:37:42.863
Grieving?

01:37:42.996 --> 01:37:43.864
No one is grieving.

01:37:43.997 --> 01:37:45.132
We have won.

01:37:45.265 --> 01:37:46.900
We have thrown off the yoke.

01:37:47.034 --> 01:37:48.902
My king, I wish to seek
our lost agojie.

01:37:49.036 --> 01:37:50.137
Some were taken captive.

01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:51.615
They will be sold,
used by the men.

01:37:51.639 --> 01:37:54.542
Nanisca, the moment
you seek is here.

01:37:54.676 --> 01:37:56.578
The few have been sacrificed
for the many.

01:37:56.711 --> 01:37:59.581
- Now we must move forward.
- I can go alone. Let me try.

01:37:59.714 --> 01:38:02.584
- The oyo...
- You disobey me, nanisca.

01:38:02.717 --> 01:38:06.353
Are you confusing
my admiration for weakness?

01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:09.323
I am your king.

01:38:09.456 --> 01:38:13.894
Let me tell you, you will not
seek out those captives.

01:38:14.027 --> 01:38:15.996
You must stay by my side

01:38:16.130 --> 01:38:18.899
and take the honor I bestow you.

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:22.236
Do not force my anger.

01:38:37.317 --> 01:38:39.119
In the morning, they will come.

01:38:39.253 --> 01:38:41.155
- Back up! Move it! Move it!
- Get back! Back!

01:38:41.288 --> 01:38:43.390
- Move back!
- Back! Move it!

01:38:43.525 --> 01:38:44.525
Move!

01:38:44.559 --> 01:38:47.161
Stay back!

01:38:55.703 --> 01:38:57.204
Move!

01:38:57.337 --> 01:39:00.608
They will take the agojie first.

01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:26.233
On your feet.

01:39:33.307 --> 01:39:36.276
We must have Patience.

01:39:42.015 --> 01:39:44.084
When we are brought
to the block,

01:39:44.218 --> 01:39:46.688
we will be unshackled.

01:39:46.821 --> 01:39:49.156
We will have our legs.

01:39:59.132 --> 01:40:02.570
We must not let them see
my arm is broken.

01:40:19.286 --> 01:40:23.023
When we are sold,
that will be the moment.

01:40:23.156 --> 01:40:24.993
You will make a distraction.

01:40:25.125 --> 01:40:26.895
I give you 90 for this one.

01:40:27.027 --> 01:40:28.563
120.

01:40:30.163 --> 01:40:32.499
Oba, you said you would
be good to me here.

01:40:32.634 --> 01:40:34.802
Mm-mm. It will go
to the highest bidder.

01:40:34.936 --> 01:40:38.006
We will
each disarm a guard and run.

01:40:38.138 --> 01:40:41.108
Do not stop
until you reach the water.

01:40:41.241 --> 01:40:43.343
150 reais.

01:40:49.416 --> 01:40:51.251
Nawi!

01:41:43.972 --> 01:41:45.305
No.

01:41:48.241 --> 01:41:50.845
No.

01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:54.849
No.

01:42:01.221 --> 01:42:02.824
Izogie.

01:42:02.957 --> 01:42:07.028
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:08.796
Get up.

01:42:08.930 --> 01:42:09.998
No!

01:42:10.130 --> 01:42:13.367
Izogie, get up.

01:42:19.306 --> 01:42:22.142
No, no, no, no.

01:42:22.275 --> 01:42:23.845
I'm sorry.

01:42:23.978 --> 01:42:25.278
N-Nawi.

01:42:27.447 --> 01:42:29.483
You move like a sloth.

01:42:29.617 --> 01:42:32.020
I'm sorry.

01:42:32.152 --> 01:42:33.286
I'm sorry.

01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:35.155
I'm sorry. Let's-let's go.

01:42:35.288 --> 01:42:37.357
Let's go.

01:42:41.228 --> 01:42:43.097
Izogie?

01:42:43.263 --> 01:42:45.533
Izogie. Izogie.

01:42:49.302 --> 01:42:51.204
You get away from her!

01:42:51.338 --> 01:42:54.108
Get away!

01:43:11.224 --> 01:43:15.195
If you want this one, 100 reais.

01:43:34.849 --> 01:43:36.416
- What are you doing?
- Move aside.

01:43:36.551 --> 01:43:38.753
You know what the king
will do to you if you defy him.

01:43:38.886 --> 01:43:40.387
You want to be expelled
or worse?

01:43:40.521 --> 01:43:42.289
- No, no, no, no. Nanisca.
- Amenza. Amenza.

01:43:42.422 --> 01:43:45.059
- I cannot stand by.
- I know what it is.

01:43:45.193 --> 01:43:47.628
In the dream.

01:43:47.762 --> 01:43:50.932
The beast I am so frightened of.

01:43:56.403 --> 01:43:58.706
It is me.

01:44:02.577 --> 01:44:05.479
It is that girl who was silenced

01:44:05.613 --> 01:44:09.517
in those shackles by those men.

01:44:12.319 --> 01:44:14.488
I've hidden her away.

01:44:14.622 --> 01:44:17.558
I have denied her pain.

01:44:21.361 --> 01:44:24.832
But I'm going to hear her now.

01:44:25.933 --> 01:44:27.168
Hmm?

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:29.737
I have to try to save her.

01:44:29.871 --> 01:44:31.005
No.

01:44:32.439 --> 01:44:34.474
Please.

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.929
It is not safe for us.
I brought you clothes.

01:46:02.063 --> 01:46:04.532
I will sneak you out
at nightfall.

01:46:04.665 --> 01:46:06.334
Do you own me now?

01:46:06.466 --> 01:46:07.935
- Of course not.
- Get out!

01:46:08.069 --> 01:46:09.989
- I am trying to protect you.
- By locking me in?

01:46:10.071 --> 01:46:12.273
Do you know what
they would do to you?

01:46:12.405 --> 01:46:14.609
A white man was killed.

01:46:18.512 --> 01:46:21.515
You have the key now.

01:46:21.649 --> 01:46:24.785
You can choose
when the lock is turned.

01:47:28.082 --> 01:47:32.520
My mother guided me here
to find myself.

01:47:33.453 --> 01:47:34.922
And I found you.

01:47:35.056 --> 01:47:39.527
I have booked passage on
a cargo ship bound for england.

01:47:40.728 --> 01:47:42.196
I want to keep you safe.

01:47:47.568 --> 01:47:51.906
My heart has many scars.

01:48:08.289 --> 01:48:11.491
Husband, please accept
my deepest apologies

01:48:11.625 --> 01:48:14.628
- for questioning your will.
- Mm.

01:48:14.762 --> 01:48:16.464
What do you want?

01:48:16.630 --> 01:48:17.630
Move, my friend.

01:48:17.732 --> 01:48:19.633
The wives are whispering.

01:48:19.767 --> 01:48:21.669
I told tanonu
what they say, and...

01:48:21.802 --> 01:48:23.204
Have I not told you
not to discuss

01:48:23.337 --> 01:48:25.373
my business with the wives?
Have I not told you?

01:48:25.505 --> 01:48:27.608
My king, please forgive me.

01:48:27.742 --> 01:48:29.210
Nanisca's gone to ouidah

01:48:29.343 --> 01:48:31.612
with the migan
and a number of her soldiers.

01:48:31.746 --> 01:48:33.581
- Eh?
- We must postpone the feast.

01:48:33.714 --> 01:48:35.316
No, no. The-the people gossip.

01:48:35.449 --> 01:48:39.086
You cannot postpone it now,
not without looking weak.

01:49:19.593 --> 01:49:22.730
Where are the others?

01:49:22.863 --> 01:49:26.200
Izogie was killed, miganon.

01:49:26.333 --> 01:49:28.669
Nawi is gone.

01:49:45.686 --> 01:49:47.556
There will be no prisoners.

01:49:47.688 --> 01:49:51.258
Burn their whole trade
to the ground.

01:50:17.985 --> 01:50:21.255
Sound the alarm!

01:50:40.908 --> 01:50:42.810
Nawi. Nawi.

01:50:42.943 --> 01:50:44.945
I need to come in.

01:50:46.814 --> 01:50:47.882
We must go.

01:50:48.015 --> 01:50:49.884
My sisters have come.

01:50:50.017 --> 01:50:51.620
I have to help them.

01:50:51.752 --> 01:50:53.654
Then I will help you.

01:50:53.787 --> 01:50:56.790
No. Malik.

01:50:57.691 --> 01:50:59.960
You must go.

01:51:04.965 --> 01:51:07.301
Your clothes are bloody.

01:51:10.539 --> 01:51:12.773
You can wear these.

01:51:19.847 --> 01:51:22.449
I will take care of him.

01:51:23.652 --> 01:51:25.920
I will be on the beach.

01:52:02.890 --> 01:52:04.925
I want oba.

01:52:21.576 --> 01:52:24.778
Hurry up, this way,
this way! Come on!

01:52:24.912 --> 01:52:26.780
Move, damn it!

01:52:34.522 --> 01:52:36.524
No! No! No!

01:52:36.658 --> 01:52:38.492
Malik!

01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:45.866
Malik! Malik, in!

01:52:59.113 --> 01:53:01.215
Malik, no! No! No!

01:53:01.348 --> 01:53:02.950
Loose me! Loose me!

01:53:03.083 --> 01:53:05.754
<i>NÃ£o! NÃ£o! NÃ£o!</i>

01:53:05.886 --> 01:53:08.556
Malik! Malik, <i>nÃ£o!</i>

01:53:08.690 --> 01:53:11.425
<i>NÃ£o!</i>

01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:55.336
Hyah!

01:55:28.863 --> 01:55:31.498
You do not remember me.

01:55:34.903 --> 01:55:38.138
Now you will never forget.

01:56:17.010 --> 01:56:19.246
No, no, no, no!

01:57:16.671 --> 01:57:17.939
Agojie!

01:57:18.071 --> 01:57:19.139
Wu suu!

01:57:19.273 --> 01:57:21.809
- Agojie!
- Wu suu!

01:57:21.943 --> 01:57:23.210
Agojie!

01:57:23.343 --> 01:57:24.846
Wu suu!

01:57:24.979 --> 01:57:26.848
- Agojie!
- Wu suu!

01:57:26.981 --> 01:57:28.583
Agojie!

01:57:28.716 --> 01:57:29.784
Wu suu!

01:57:29.918 --> 01:57:31.586
Agojie!

01:57:31.719 --> 01:57:33.153
Wu suu!

01:57:35.188 --> 01:57:36.056
Come. We cannot stay here.

01:57:36.189 --> 01:57:37.725
Get in the boat!

01:58:25.172 --> 01:58:27.174
Shante, well done.

01:58:27.307 --> 01:58:29.077
You deserve it.

01:58:45.727 --> 01:58:47.929
Nanisca! Nanisca!

01:58:48.062 --> 01:58:51.298
Nanisca! Nanisca! Nanisca!

01:58:51.431 --> 01:58:54.334
Nanisca! Nanisca!

01:58:54.468 --> 01:58:58.205
Nanisca! Nanisca! Nanisca!

01:58:58.338 --> 01:59:01.075
Nanisca! Nanisca!

01:59:01.208 --> 01:59:04.812
Nanisca! Nanisca! Nanisca!

01:59:04.946 --> 01:59:07.180
Nanisca! Nanisca!

01:59:07.314 --> 01:59:09.917
Nanisca! Nanisca!

01:59:30.605 --> 01:59:35.342
You disobey your king, nanisca.

01:59:36.611 --> 01:59:39.614
I will resign my command.

01:59:50.490 --> 01:59:52.392
People of dahomey...

01:59:54.494 --> 01:59:56.731
We have ended the reign
of the oyo empire.

02:00:04.438 --> 02:00:06.140
Look upon the faces
of the warriors.

02:00:06.273 --> 02:00:08.375
Look at them.

02:00:09.342 --> 02:00:11.612
Many never thought it possible.

02:00:12.312 --> 02:00:14.247
But we believed.

02:00:15.382 --> 02:00:17.618
That is what makes
a great leader.

02:00:18.519 --> 02:00:20.588
Seeing what others do not.

02:00:20.722 --> 02:00:24.525
The Europeans
and the Americans have seen

02:00:24.659 --> 02:00:28.228
if you want to hold
a people in chains,

02:00:28.361 --> 02:00:29.764
one must first convince them

02:00:29.897 --> 02:00:33.366
that they are meant to be bound.

02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:37.105
We joined them in becoming
our own oppressor.

02:00:37.237 --> 02:00:39.439
But no more.

02:00:40.942 --> 02:00:42.844
No more.

02:00:44.311 --> 02:00:46.748
We are a warrior people!

02:00:46.881 --> 02:00:50.450
And there is power
in our mind...

02:00:50.585 --> 02:00:54.856
In our unity, in our culture.

02:00:54.989 --> 02:00:58.626
If we understand that power,
we will be limitless.

02:01:00.128 --> 02:01:02.196
My people,

02:01:02.329 --> 02:01:04.899
this is a vision I will lead.

02:01:05.833 --> 02:01:08.770
It is a vision that is shared.

02:01:13.508 --> 02:01:16.544
Heroes of dahomey,

02:01:16.677 --> 02:01:20.380
behold the bravest of the brave,

02:01:20.515 --> 02:01:22.415
appointed by king ghezo,

02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:26.286
elevated to the sacred title
of kpojito,

02:01:26.419 --> 02:01:29.190
nanisca, the woman king.

02:02:23.511 --> 02:02:26.681
An offering for izogie.

02:02:26.814 --> 02:02:30.051
She does not want that water.

02:02:31.152 --> 02:02:32.954
She wants this.

02:02:48.970 --> 02:02:51.839
In my blood is the blood
of a killer.

02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:59.714
A man who gave you so much pain.

02:03:04.518 --> 02:03:06.787
I am sorry.

02:03:16.097 --> 02:03:18.132
You are agojie.

02:03:29.644 --> 02:03:32.412
I am sorry.

02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:35.750
I left you.

02:03:39.553 --> 02:03:42.156
I was not brave enough.

02:03:45.126 --> 02:03:49.830
But you survived because
you are meant to be here.

02:03:57.805 --> 02:04:01.474
It is not your fault
what happened to me.

02:04:04.512 --> 02:04:06.714
You...

02:04:06.847 --> 02:04:10.117
Are not the thing that hurt me.

02:04:14.555 --> 02:04:16.891
You are nawi.

02:04:20.594 --> 02:04:22.997
You are my daughter.

02:04:25.166 --> 02:04:26.901
I am sorry.

02:05:56.824 --> 02:05:59.160
Mother, will you dance?

02:09:38.045 --> 02:09:40.080
Sisters in blood.

02:09:40.214 --> 02:09:45.886
You fall and now you rise.

02:09:47.955 --> 02:09:49.490
Dance with us.

02:09:49.624 --> 02:09:52.761
Be with us.

02:09:52.893 --> 02:09:55.095
You live for me...

02:09:55.963 --> 02:09:58.065
And I for you.

02:10:02.436 --> 02:10:04.138

02:10:04.905 --> 02:10:07.241

02:10:12.747 --> 02:10:14.481
Alekko.

02:10:14.616 --> 02:10:16.483
Kesia.

02:10:16.618 --> 02:10:18.152
Breonna.
