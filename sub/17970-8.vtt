01:12.614 --> 01:16.242
Everything that lives
must one day fade away.

01:16.410 --> 01:21.748
In its place, new roots take hold.
New life grows.

01:23.625 --> 01:28.629
There may be some impure elements
left behind.

01:29.173 --> 01:33.551
Some still who remain hidden
within the Abbey.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.642
You want them killed.

01:42.478 --> 01:43.853
Purified.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.983
And what about the CDC?

01:55.949 --> 01:58.451
Purify them first.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.995
But bring Dr. Jordan to me.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.638
Sarah.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.058
Sarah, open up.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.561
Sarah, please.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.732
Sarah. Sarah, open the door.

02:29.900 --> 02:33.528
Look, what happened to you.... Just....

02:33.695 --> 02:35.738
Sarah, don't shut me out. Talk to me.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.241
Please.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.493
Open the door.

02:42.246 --> 02:43.955
Sarah.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.752
Get out of my way.
I need to go to the lab.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.754
You're not seriously
going back to work?

02:51.922 --> 02:54.841
What would you like me to do?
Curl up in my bed and cry?

02:55.008 --> 02:59.053
-We have to get you off this island.
-I'm not going until I find my baby.

02:59.221 --> 03:02.056
It's still alive, Alan. I know it is.

03:02.224 --> 03:05.142
Somehow, I don't know how,
but I know that it's alive.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.145
I've run every possible prenatal test
known to man.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.814
My baby is different.

03:09.982 --> 03:11.232
-Okay? It just--
-Our baby.

03:13.569 --> 03:17.113
Exactly. So you should understand
why I need to know one way or the other.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.981
Day eight, St. Germain Abbey.

03:52.149 --> 03:55.818
Still haven't located the contact.
I'm on my own.

03:55.986 --> 04:00.197
The plan is to make camp for the night,
depart at 0600 hours.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.873
Potential contact Caleb has been vetted.
He knows nothing.

04:12.502 --> 04:15.004
This island is nothing but a grave.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.127
What happened?

05:00.676 --> 05:01.926
Are they...?

05:02.844 --> 05:04.971
Are they all...?

05:05.138 --> 05:07.556
The thinning is completed.

05:09.685 --> 05:14.188
It was a terrible day,
but a necessary one.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.068
The children are...

05:20.529 --> 05:23.072
...always the most difficult.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.243
Tiny hands.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.039
A pity they couldn't be spared.

05:36.420 --> 05:39.505
I'm sorry you had
to go through it alone.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.175
That's not what you were saying
yesterday.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.763
I've had time to think.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.809
About Anne and Agnes...

05:53.145 --> 05:55.479
...and all of my sisters.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.360
Each of them had a role.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.612
As I now have mine.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.574
And what is that?

06:06.742 --> 06:08.826
To surpass them.

06:09.244 --> 06:13.289
To not just be another portrait
on that wall...

06:13.915 --> 06:15.499
...but to outshine them all.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.170
You....

06:21.048 --> 06:23.382
You need a partner by your side.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.470
Pillar of strength...

06:28.597 --> 06:30.598
...not a sheep to slaughter.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.769
Honor me?

06:38.065 --> 06:40.775
Make me the first in the new line.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.248
You remind me of Abigail.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.752
Our first mother.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.339
Then let me take her place...

07:05.383 --> 07:07.301
...by your side...

07:08.011 --> 07:10.471
...in your bed.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.957
Since you've grown into womanhood...

07:41.002 --> 07:43.921
...I've so looked forward
to our planting ritual.

07:50.345 --> 07:53.639
Your mother was a fine...

07:53.807 --> 07:57.143
...and decent woman.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.812
But you...

08:00.480 --> 08:02.565
...you have...

08:02.732 --> 08:04.441
...fire.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.909
You're not to come in here.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.496
What is this?

08:17.664 --> 08:19.957
Were you waiting
until I was actually in labor?

08:20.125 --> 08:23.752
What do you think you're doing?
Get your hands off me.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.006
I'm afraid there has been
a change of plans.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.762
There isn't going
to be a planting ritual today.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.848
Or ever.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.824
It's different when it's murder.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.829
I've dug graves
in the most remote corners of the Earth.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.497
But this....

09:00.665 --> 09:03.626
I'm so sorry.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.260
I never thought
he'd go through with this.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.222
He won't get away with it.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.975
Oh course he will.
Who's going to stop him?

09:20.977 --> 09:25.773
I have associates
coming to the island soon.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.568
Oh, my God.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.368
What happened?

09:39.287 --> 09:42.164
-What are you doing here?
-Found him last night.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.959
Anne too. They were in some big pit.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.419
You son of a bitch.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.632
Hey.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.764
Hey. All right. Hey.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.184
Hey, knock it off. That's enough.
All right. Stop it.

10:02.352 --> 10:05.271
Knock it off. That's it. That's enough.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.195
What the hell is going on?

10:17.492 --> 10:20.411
Secure the exits.
I want this facility locked down.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.247
-No one in or out without my orders.
-Yes, ma'am.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.540
-You, with me.
-Yes, sir.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.418
-Dr. Farragut.
-Lieutenant Commander Winger.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.585
CDC sent us for you.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.045
-You're being evacuated.
-Why?

10:30.213 --> 10:32.923
Because this is no longer
the only island under quarantine.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.133
Pathogen is spreading.

10:55.739 --> 10:59.116
-Is this all from the pathogen?
-It wasn't the pathogen.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.119
They were murdered.

11:02.287 --> 11:05.414
A result of the island's cult leader
cooling on his followers.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.708
Just like Jim Jones.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.335
We should just go--

11:11.546 --> 11:13.547
-Easy, boys.
-Hold on.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.884
Commander, how is it possible
the pathogen has spread?

11:17.052 --> 11:20.262
-You said there were no other islands.
-Officially, there aren't.

11:20.430 --> 11:25.184
Unofficially, a U.S. Military radar outpost
is located 40 miles to the southwest.

11:25.352 --> 11:28.771
They've lost 75 people.
More getting sick and dying every day.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.022
Must be the bees.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.150
Maybe they got caught in the jet stream
and blown to the island.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.277
-Bees?
-It's not confirmed yet.

11:35.445 --> 11:38.364
We think bees might be responsible
for spreading the infection.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.616
You have more experience
than anyone.

11:40.784 --> 11:43.660
That's why my orders
are to get you to St. Sebastien ASAP.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.705
We can't just run off.
We haven't contained the pathogen here.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.957
-My orders are very clear.
-I'm not leaving.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.626
-Sarah, I'll handle this.
-Don't.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.294
You two....

11:53.797 --> 11:56.715
Sarah, maybe you should go with him.
Get off the island.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.343
-Who the hell is this?
-He's no one.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.803
This is Dr. Alan Farragut...

12:00.970 --> 12:03.806
...one of the top infectious-disease
specialists in the world.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.766
How many Dr. Farraguts are there?

12:07.310 --> 12:08.852
He's my brother.

12:09.020 --> 12:11.146
Is he as much of a pain in the ass
as you?

12:12.315 --> 12:16.777
Tell me, is the other Dr. Farragut
as good as Dr. Jordan claims he is?

12:19.447 --> 12:21.615
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.867
Great. Then he's coming with us too.

12:24.035 --> 12:26.161
-I don't work for the CDC.
-And I don't care.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.247
-I'm not coming with you.
-You're coming.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.667
On your own or bound and gagged.
Your choice.

12:31.835 --> 12:35.838
What about the other survivors?
Anne and her people?

12:36.005 --> 12:38.298
There are two Coast Guard cutters
a day behind us.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.342
They'll be rounding up any survivors.

12:40.510 --> 12:44.138
It's a mandatory evacuation.
The island is being quarantined.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.432
No. You can't.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.851
It's the only way
to eliminate the pathogen.

12:49.018 --> 12:52.020
St. Germain has been our home
for hundreds of years.

12:52.856 --> 12:55.566
For most of us,
the only home we've ever known.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.318
-The dead deserve our respect.
-I agree.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.737
You have 24 hours to give it to them.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.449
-But--
-This isn't an argument. It's my call.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.493
I won't be responsible
for another Narvik.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.665
Dr. Farragut,
where do you think you're going?

13:12.667 --> 13:15.043
If you wanna bring
my brother along, fine.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.880
But right now
I'm caring for these people.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.173
And that's my call.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.055
Anne, wait.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.476
What are you doing, Peter?
Don't abandon your friends for me.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.977
Hey.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.439
I went missing for three days...

13:35.607 --> 13:38.525
...and they didn't make much of an effort
to find me.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.987
Are you okay?

13:42.655 --> 13:46.033
I feel so lost. Alone.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.620
We kept out the outside world
for so long.

13:49.787 --> 13:53.123
But I always afraid
this day would come.

13:54.918 --> 13:57.377
I won't let them destroy your home.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.547
Thank you, Peter.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.218
Now I need to go pay respects
to our dead.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.345
Not alone, you don't.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.390
My friends...

14:11.434 --> 14:15.062
...they may not care
about giving those people a proper burial.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.356
But I'm not like them.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.159
How does it feel
choosing another's path?

14:29.327 --> 14:30.953
You tell me.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.955
You've been doing it for centuries.

14:33.122 --> 14:36.542
I've always enjoyed my unique place
in this world.

14:36.709 --> 14:40.963
Take Agnes, for example.
Her death was swift and merciful.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.007
I saved her
from a long and painful decline.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.843
Don't you talk about her.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.221
-You don't have that right.
-Of course I do.

14:49.389 --> 14:53.141
I made her, and I ended her,
just as I'm going to end you.

14:53.309 --> 14:58.188
That's a lot of big talk
for a man facing the end of his path.

14:59.065 --> 15:03.235
I'm going to enjoy not having to hear
you chirping in my ear every day.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.738
You say that,
but what are you going to do?

15:06.906 --> 15:09.908
What are you going to do, girl?

15:10.076 --> 15:11.368
You want to kill me?

15:11.995 --> 15:13.954
I've lived 500 years.

15:14.122 --> 15:17.249
Death waits for me.

15:17.417 --> 15:21.878
No matter what you do,
I will live forever.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.009
Good.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.137
I'm counting on it.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.891
Hey. What happened to you last night?

15:36.144 --> 15:38.228
Are you okay?

15:38.396 --> 15:42.232
I.... I don't really wanna talk about it.

15:42.900 --> 15:46.194
Okay. Just glad you're all in one piece.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.990
Doesn't.... Doesn't really feel like that.

15:50.158 --> 15:53.201
You'll feel better
once we get off this island.

15:54.579 --> 15:57.831
Can't imagine how things
could get any more insane.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.626
I can.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.630
Oh, hey, I found this old ledger.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.966
Some kind of genealogy record
dating back to the 1600s.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.176
Here's the weird part.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.429
Look at the father's name.

16:15.308 --> 16:19.394
He's listed as the father for every child
over the last 400 years.

16:19.562 --> 16:20.854
Has to be a mistake.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.417
Michel Dubois?

16:42.919 --> 16:44.795
It's Michael.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.507
-Michael couldn't have fathered every kid.
-But what if he did?

16:48.675 --> 16:51.343
And what if it has something to do
with the pathogen?

16:52.178 --> 16:56.223
Come on, things are intense enough
without you screwing with my head.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.936
-Look, Kyle, we really need to talk.
-About what?

17:01.104 --> 17:03.313
A 500-year-old-man?

17:15.284 --> 17:17.786
This is payback
for all the Hot Zone stuff, right?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.622
How do you expect me
to believe that you're--?

17:20.790 --> 17:24.126
Immortal? It's okay. You can say it.

17:24.919 --> 17:29.381
I understand this is very difficult to grasp,
but what could I gain by lying to you?

17:29.549 --> 17:31.550
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

17:31.718 --> 17:32.843
Maybe you're sick.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.595
Paranoid delusions are a symptom
of the pathogen.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.681
Preceded by jaundice
and fungal nodules...

17:37.849 --> 17:39.808
...neither of which I have.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.393
Come on, this is crazy.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.771
What about my foot injury?

17:45.523 --> 17:47.774
You stitched it up yourself, right?

17:47.942 --> 17:51.653
The spike tore through the sesamoid
and took a good two inches of skin.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.740
It took 18 hours to heal.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.493
And my stab wound?
You saw how much blood I lost.

17:58.661 --> 18:01.538
I had a punctured lung,
a lacerated liver.

18:07.211 --> 18:11.423
So you got a hell of an immune system.
Still, that doesn't prove the other thing.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.634
Tell me how. What other reasonable
explanation is there for this?

18:15.762 --> 18:20.015
No. No. There's no way it can be true.

18:32.195 --> 18:34.196
Stop screwing around.
The honey's dangerous.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.324
It is, isn't it? Highly infectious.
Crawling with mycotoxin.

18:37.492 --> 18:40.202
Sarah, Jesus. Don't--
Don't. That's suicide.

18:44.957 --> 18:45.999
Delicious.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.878
Brother Harris.

18:50.046 --> 18:52.255
He cared for the roses.

18:52.423 --> 18:55.008
He knew to the day
when they would bloom.

18:59.764 --> 19:03.058
-You said this happened before?
-Yes.

19:03.226 --> 19:05.769
Most recently
about a hundred years ago.

19:05.937 --> 19:10.190
Then, as now, the fellowship failed.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.653
It was Michael, wasn't it?

19:14.821 --> 19:16.780
Even back then?

19:16.948 --> 19:18.573
Yes.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.951
But how did you know?

19:22.870 --> 19:26.581
I've known quite a few immortals, Anne.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.416
How many?

19:28.584 --> 19:32.087
At the beginning, there were 500.

19:34.757 --> 19:37.008
We thought he was a god.

19:38.511 --> 19:42.430
Never aging, healing so quickly.

19:42.932 --> 19:47.769
He told us he was the only one,
and we never questioned it.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.938
We trusted him.

19:51.858 --> 19:57.696
But when Agnes saw Dr. Jordan's eyes,
she knew.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.700
We were such fools.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.871
You had no reason not to believe him.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.623
But now I do.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.712
And he's going to have
to answer to me.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.090
I've been wanting to tell you for a while.

20:17.258 --> 20:19.968
Why? So my head could explode?

20:20.553 --> 20:22.929
You know, I didn't like lying to you.

20:25.641 --> 20:29.936
Look, it was difficult for me
to accept too...

20:30.313 --> 20:32.480
...but it's who I am now.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.902
So all the times
I was worried sick about you....

20:38.613 --> 20:40.238
It was....

20:40.823 --> 20:43.241
It was very sweet.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.339
Stop it. Stop shooting.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.467
-Stop it.
-Get out of the way, Dr. Farragut.

21:00.635 --> 21:04.512
Tell your men we're here to cure
this pathogen, not murder its victims.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.348
-What happened?
-Came out of nowhere.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.393
Must have been hiding
inside the building.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.817
I saw this man five days ago
outside the gate.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.194
That's not possible.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.613
He chased me and Peter.
I put two bullets in him.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.911
-You said they were dead.
-We thought they were.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.704
You thought?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.541
-I want two men on the gates.
-Yes, ma'am.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.336
We're getting the hell out of here.

21:37.672 --> 21:40.548
No. We can't leave. We need
to examine this Mycotic right away.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.175
-My-what?
-My--

21:42.343 --> 21:44.427
No more stalling.
Finish packing and let's go.

21:44.595 --> 21:48.139
No. No, Sarah's right.
This pathogen kills in two days.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.392
-This man's been alive for at least five.
-So?

21:50.559 --> 21:54.270
So if the Mycotics outside the wall
are not dying, we need to figure out why.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.565
This could be the break
that leads us to the cure.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.860
You really think you have something?

22:01.696 --> 22:03.655
We won't know
until we can do an autopsy.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.411
A quick autopsy.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.621
We ship out at 1600.

22:14.917 --> 22:17.794
So is this it, my dear?

22:19.588 --> 22:22.424
Is this your grand plan?

22:22.591 --> 22:23.883
Most of it.

22:26.679 --> 22:30.807
And do you think you've beaten me?

22:31.976 --> 22:36.062
You've imprisoned the king.
Congratulations.

22:36.230 --> 22:40.358
That would make you
the queen of nothing.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.986
This coming from a man
who just killed his children.

22:43.154 --> 22:45.196
Yes. Yes.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.658
Yes, I've killed a thousand
of my children.

22:50.703 --> 22:56.291
And I will create a thousand more
and kill them all over again.

22:56.459 --> 22:58.376
Children...

22:58.544 --> 23:01.337
...are simply wisps of dandelions.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.798
Such bravado...

23:04.800 --> 23:08.303
...for a man who stayed hidden
on an island his entire life.

23:08.471 --> 23:11.347
Men have worshiped me, little girl.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.600
I'm sorry. I can't hear you from up here.

23:14.769 --> 23:17.395
Get on with it already.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.230
Get on with it.

23:20.274 --> 23:23.359
Fill this pit with snakes...

23:23.527 --> 23:28.239
...or rats or whatever else you imagine
might frighten me.

23:30.034 --> 23:32.410
Well, what, then?

23:32.912 --> 23:35.830
You going to burn me?

23:36.624 --> 23:38.083
Drown me?

23:38.250 --> 23:42.754
Armies have tried to kill me and failed.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.924
It's ready.

23:46.092 --> 23:49.803
Is that my punishment finally arriving?

23:50.679 --> 23:52.347
It is.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.768
A fitting end for a king,
if I do say so myself.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.416
What do you think you're doing?

24:22.878 --> 24:25.964
I'm creating a monument to you.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.173
A shrine.

24:27.341 --> 24:30.176
You think this is going to scare me?

24:33.180 --> 24:36.099
But you can't do this to me.
I'm your father.

24:38.185 --> 24:41.479
And I'm a dandelion with teeth.

24:44.108 --> 24:46.860
You can't do this to me!

24:47.027 --> 24:48.570
I will have centuries!

24:48.737 --> 24:51.114
-You know what to do.
-And you have mere seconds.

24:51.282 --> 24:52.323
Three layers.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.826
You will become dust.

24:55.327 --> 24:59.539
And the dust will settle upon this island,
and when I'm free...

24:59.707 --> 25:01.624
...I will walk upon that dust.

25:01.792 --> 25:07.755
No matter what you do,
you will wither away and die!

25:07.923 --> 25:10.300
I will live forever!

25:10.467 --> 25:14.721
And you will die!

26:37.221 --> 26:40.431
I'll meet you at autopsy.
There's something I need to do.

26:40.599 --> 26:43.935
Be careful with that one.
She's dangerous.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.065
Amy.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.776
I need to speak with Michael.
Where is he?

26:51.944 --> 26:56.739
Dr. Jordan, I understand you
and your friends will be leaving us soon.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.366
It'll be a shame to see you go.

26:58.534 --> 27:01.536
Turns out we're not leaving just yet.
So I need to see Michael.

27:03.289 --> 27:06.541
I'm sorry.
Michael's no longer in charge here.

27:06.709 --> 27:08.293
Then who is?

27:11.714 --> 27:13.172
You're kidding me, right?

27:15.009 --> 27:17.719
Given our recent tragedy,
I'd expect more compassion.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.595
Compassion?

27:19.763 --> 27:21.681
You people ripped my baby out of me.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.143
I wasn't even aware you were pregnant.

27:25.311 --> 27:28.271
-You've really kept your figure.
-Do you think this is a joke?

27:28.439 --> 27:31.024
Of course not.
No one here would ever hurt a baby.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.818
I don't know what happened to you...

27:33.986 --> 27:36.821
...but if you want my help,
all you need to do is ask.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.701
Dr. Jordan?

27:41.869 --> 27:45.705
Lieutenant Commander Winger requests
you don't stray from the group.

27:45.873 --> 27:48.124
Are you saying you can help me
find my baby?

27:48.751 --> 27:51.669
Of course. Michael's gone.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.172
This fellowship won't run
on fear anymore.

27:54.798 --> 27:58.009
Dr. Jordan, please.

27:58.594 --> 28:02.972
I haven't seen Sarah in a while.
Any idea where she's gone off to?

28:03.140 --> 28:05.099
She wanted to have a word with Amy.

28:05.267 --> 28:06.934
And you let her?

28:07.853 --> 28:10.813
I think Sarah can take care of herself.

28:10.981 --> 28:15.193
What with all the immortality stuff.

28:17.071 --> 28:20.365
-So you're up to speed on that, are you?
-Seriously?

28:21.241 --> 28:25.078
I didn't believe it at first either.
But trust me, it's real.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.043
Was she born that way?

28:32.211 --> 28:35.338
-No, made.
-By who?

28:35.506 --> 28:37.632
It's a long story.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.675
But it all ties back to Ilaria.

28:39.843 --> 28:43.763
Come on. You're not really gonna try
and connect them to this too, are you?

28:43.931 --> 28:47.016
It's why I'm here.
It's why the world thinks I'm a criminal.

28:47.184 --> 28:51.354
Ilaria is run by immortals,
and I am trying to stop them.

28:52.648 --> 28:55.066
Gentlemen, anything to report?

28:56.026 --> 28:59.237
We still have to run a tox panel
to be certain, but this is promising.

28:59.405 --> 29:04.242
The subject's teeth are discolored
with a red substance.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.703
He has traces of the same substance
under his fingernails, in his hair.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.581
So he doesn't brush after meals.
What are you telling me?

29:10.749 --> 29:12.750
Found this in his stomach.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.544
Looks like tree sap.

29:15.295 --> 29:16.838
Maybe Sangre de Grado.

29:17.005 --> 29:20.341
-It's a medicinal resin.
-Whatever it is, he's been living off it.

29:20.509 --> 29:23.010
-You think this gunk may lead to a cure?
-It's a lead.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.388
Right now it's the only lead we have.

29:25.556 --> 29:28.141
And it's the reason
we can't leave this island.

29:28.308 --> 29:31.477
-Hey, wait a minute.
-I agreed to an autopsy, nothing more.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.313
And our autopsy uncovered
a potential treatment.

29:34.481 --> 29:35.898
A treatment, not a cure.

29:36.066 --> 29:38.985
The victims are still showing
all the symptoms of mycosis.

29:39.153 --> 29:41.279
We need to get out there
and investigate.

29:41.447 --> 29:44.490
-Find out what this is all about.
-Outside the walls?

29:44.658 --> 29:48.786
This island is littered with corpses.
I am not adding another name to that list.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.413
You know what, Peter?

29:50.581 --> 29:54.083
You're right for once in your life.

29:54.251 --> 29:56.711
-This has nothing to do with me.
-Dr. Farragut.

29:56.879 --> 30:00.256
You can shoot me, commander.
I'm done.

30:00.757 --> 30:03.593
I don't know what kind of shit show
you are used to running...

30:03.760 --> 30:05.428
...but this is not how we do things.

30:05.596 --> 30:07.930
-I'll talk to him.
-Sarah.

30:08.098 --> 30:09.265
Peter, get out of my way.

30:09.433 --> 30:13.352
If you leave this room, you are finished
with my team. Do you understand?

30:13.520 --> 30:17.607
It was never your team, Peter.
You were just keeping Alan's chair warm.

30:26.909 --> 30:29.577
-Alan.
-This wasn't supposed to happen.

30:29.745 --> 30:33.831
I wanted all of you as far away
from this as possible.

30:33.999 --> 30:38.669
All I wanted was to-- Was to stop Ilaria,
to beat them at their own game.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.630
I never meant to be involved with CDC.

30:40.797 --> 30:43.466
I know you didn't.
But now you are involved.

30:43.634 --> 30:48.054
-Not anymore. I'm sorry, Sarah.
-Alan, this is why you're here.

30:48.222 --> 30:50.723
You wanna stop Ilaria,
you stop this pathogen.

30:50.891 --> 30:52.308
You find a cure.

30:52.476 --> 30:57.021
If this isn't part of Ilaria's plan, it will be
as soon as they find out how deadly it is.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.357
Peter won't go.
Kyle doesn't have experience.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.108
I've never asked you for anything.

31:01.276 --> 31:04.153
I'm asking you for this now
so I can go and find our baby.

31:04.321 --> 31:06.656
Amy knows something.

31:06.823 --> 31:09.492
I need to stay here
and find out what it is.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.744
Please.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.136
All right.

31:30.514 --> 31:31.556
All right, I'll go.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.189
I said, right.

31:40.774 --> 31:43.651
A little to the right.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.741
What is going on here?

31:50.909 --> 31:53.953
Mother. Thanks for stopping by.

31:55.581 --> 31:58.207
Do you think I should keep the rug?

31:59.543 --> 32:01.419
So many wonderful memories.

32:02.004 --> 32:03.129
Where's Michael?

32:03.297 --> 32:06.507
Michael is no longer with us.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.884
-He's found a new path.
-What did you do?

32:10.846 --> 32:13.389
What you never had the courage to do.

32:19.313 --> 32:23.107
That means you and me...

32:23.275 --> 32:26.235
...we are responsible
for the Abbey now.

32:26.403 --> 32:29.322
No, not you and me.

32:32.242 --> 32:33.909
Just me.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.747
Don't be ridiculous.
You're my daughter.

32:39.583 --> 32:40.833
And you're my mother...

32:41.001 --> 32:46.839
...who authorized our father's request
to impregnate me.

32:51.762 --> 32:55.139
You've lost your rights,
along with Michael.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.225
The Abbey is mine now.

32:58.852 --> 33:01.020
I won't let you destroy our home...

33:01.188 --> 33:04.940
...not after the destruction Michael
has caused already.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.610
Agnes is dead.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.987
Michael is gone.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.823
There's no one left
to coddle you anymore.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.033
Peter was right.

33:14.743 --> 33:18.829
You had me sent to the oubliette,
you child.

33:18.997 --> 33:22.375
All this chaos,
this death and destruction.

33:22.542 --> 33:26.337
You cannot take what he has.

33:26.505 --> 33:29.048
You cannot be what he has been.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.301
I don't want to be him.

33:32.761 --> 33:34.178
I want more.

34:17.848 --> 34:20.141
There was a time...

34:21.309 --> 34:24.311
...when buildings stood for centuries...

34:25.272 --> 34:27.732
...as men were reduced...

34:27.899 --> 34:30.860
...to crawling on their knees.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.239
But no longer.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.789
Why did you release me?

34:46.126 --> 34:48.419
What is it you want from me?

34:49.588 --> 34:51.964
My name is Julia Walker.

34:54.176 --> 34:59.472
I came looking for you once, Michael,
30 years ago.

35:01.224 --> 35:04.894
I needed your help then.
Maybe you can help me now.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.564
Thirty years.

35:09.608 --> 35:12.276
When time has no meaning...

35:12.444 --> 35:16.655
...30 years can be a day or an eternity.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.407
I'm looking for something special.

35:18.575 --> 35:21.786
Something that was rumored
to be on this island decades ago.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.662
I'm looking for a child.

35:24.748 --> 35:28.417
There's a new disease
that's killing our kind.

35:28.585 --> 35:31.670
We believe the only way to cure it
is through immortal stem cells.

35:31.838 --> 35:34.882
And we believe that child to be the key.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.134
I remember.

35:38.512 --> 35:40.888
You remember where it is?

35:42.891 --> 35:47.228
Every day in that pit, I was plagued...

35:47.395 --> 35:49.355
...by the knowledge of that child.

35:51.316 --> 35:56.153
Reminded of the failure of my work...

35:57.656 --> 36:00.032
...with my own children...

36:00.742 --> 36:02.451
...my own life.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.203
Can you tell me where it is?

36:05.330 --> 36:06.705
Tell you? No.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.918
I can show you.

36:19.553 --> 36:21.387
Check your ammo.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.982
What happened? Where's Sarah?

36:33.149 --> 36:37.319
She had business to take care of.
I'm going in her place. Where's Peter?

36:37.904 --> 36:40.072
Stormed away
once we all took your side.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.908
-Quite the soap opera, Dr. Farragut.
-Wasn't my intention.

36:43.076 --> 36:47.872
-You're wrong about this, we're screwed.
-I'm wrong about this, we're all screwed.

37:14.733 --> 37:15.858
The child's out here?

37:16.610 --> 37:18.277
Yes.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.613
There's a....

37:21.615 --> 37:23.991
A cleft in the rock...

37:24.534 --> 37:28.621
...leading to a small cave.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.464
I swear....

37:39.758 --> 37:41.175
I swear it was here.

37:43.470 --> 37:46.513
A lot can change in 30 years.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.243
Very good.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.039
Well, thank you, Ms. Walker,
for releasing me.

38:12.207 --> 38:16.168
I'm a patient man,
but even my patience has its limitations.

38:17.629 --> 38:21.715
I wouldn't want any of your immortal
friends knowing of my existence.

38:24.928 --> 38:29.431
Better to be discreet, don't you think?
Out of sight, out of mind.

39:08.638 --> 39:10.889
I guess the sword works.

39:23.820 --> 39:26.196
How are you feeling, Sarah?
May I call you Sarah?

39:26.364 --> 39:27.489
You wanna help me?

39:27.657 --> 39:30.451
Okay, tell me what happened to me
and my baby.

39:32.078 --> 39:33.662
Nothing.

39:35.123 --> 39:39.710
You call being drugged and forced
to undergo an abortion nothing?

39:39.878 --> 39:43.380
We didn't give you an abortion.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.090
We simply induced labor.

39:49.179 --> 39:50.429
You did what?

40:11.034 --> 40:12.659
I told you.

40:17.499 --> 40:19.750
We'd never hurt a baby.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.127
Would we, Landry?

40:22.295 --> 40:23.670
We would never hurt a baby.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.383
You see?

40:28.551 --> 40:29.593
It's right there.

40:29.761 --> 40:33.597
And I'd be happy to give it back to you.

40:34.265 --> 40:38.519
You just have to give me something
in return.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.357
What?

40:47.112 --> 40:49.404
Immortality.
