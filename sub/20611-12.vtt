00:01.235 --> 00:04.338
[dramatic music]

00:04.372 --> 00:06.440
*

00:06.474 --> 00:09.077
[rock music]

00:09.110 --> 00:10.744
- My name is Robert Putantsu,

00:10.778 --> 00:14.248
and my kids affectionately
call me G.O.B,

00:14.282 --> 00:16.450
grouchy old bastard.
[chuckles]

00:16.484 --> 00:20.554
Bladesmithing is calming
to me,

00:20.588 --> 00:22.656
and that's really kinda
captured my soul.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.791
*

00:23.824 --> 00:25.459
- My name is Ryan Weeks.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.794
I worked as
a fraud investigator;

00:26.827 --> 00:28.096
I worked for
the sheriff's department

00:28.129 --> 00:29.297
and the fire department;

00:29.330 --> 00:30.798
I also teach scuba diving;

00:30.831 --> 00:33.267
and I make knives part time.

00:33.301 --> 00:34.635
I'm kind of a chronic hobbyist.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.437
- I'm Paul Brock.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.671
I have work
that's been published in

00:37.705 --> 00:40.274
"Knives 2014" and "Knives 2016."

00:40.308 --> 00:42.343
I'm a journeyman smith
right now.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.346
Ultimately, I'll go on a path
to being a Mastersmith.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.748
- My name is Steven Bryan;
I'm 27 years old.

00:47.781 --> 00:50.418
A good friend of mine offered
to show me how to make a knife.

00:50.451 --> 00:53.487
It just kind of snowballed into
this monster of an obsession

00:53.521 --> 00:56.390
that I have with
bladesmithing now.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.559
As a young bladesmith,
it's my obligation

00:58.592 --> 01:00.261
to try to carry that craft on.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.196
*

01:02.230 --> 01:04.632
- Gentlemen,
welcome to the Forge.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.101
You are here to engage
in three rounds

01:07.135 --> 01:08.636
of edged weapon making
competition,

01:08.669 --> 01:11.139
designed to test
every aspect of your skills,

01:11.172 --> 01:13.274
all in front of our panel
of expert judges,

01:13.307 --> 01:15.843
ABS Mastersmith J. Neilson,

01:15.876 --> 01:19.213
historic weapons recreation
specialist, David Baker,

01:19.247 --> 01:22.183
edged weapon specialist,
Doug Marcaida.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.152
They are the ones that decide

01:24.185 --> 01:26.154
which of you will be
the "Forged in Fire" champion

01:26.187 --> 01:28.822
and leave here with
that check for $10,000.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.258
*

01:30.291 --> 01:31.825
If you look down at your anvils,

01:31.859 --> 01:33.527
you'll notice that
there's nothing there.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.829
That's because
there's a little twist.

01:35.863 --> 01:39.700
You'll be making
signature blades using this.

01:39.733 --> 01:40.734
*

01:40.768 --> 01:43.737
- Whoa!
[chuckles]

01:43.771 --> 01:48.742
- A massive chunk of
twisted elevator cable.

01:48.776 --> 01:52.213
- I've worked on
cable knives before...

01:52.246 --> 01:55.483
[chuckles]
But nothing of that size.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.218
- Keep in mind that
in the second round,

01:57.251 --> 01:58.752
you'll be attaching
handles to your blades

01:58.786 --> 02:00.588
to turn them
into fully functional weapons

02:00.621 --> 02:02.490
that will then
be tested for strength

02:02.523 --> 02:04.892
in a cable wire chop,

02:04.925 --> 02:07.795
and for edge retention
in a firehose slice.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.897
You will have ten minutes
to work on your design;

02:09.930 --> 02:12.800
you will have three hours
to forge your blades.

02:12.833 --> 02:17.305
Good luck, bladesmiths.
Your time starts now.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.939
- That is one big
piece of cable.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.542
- That's four years' worth
of knives right there.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.377
- One of the areas
that I feel like I excel in

02:23.411 --> 02:25.379
is the design aspects.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.481
I know what works
and what feels good in the hand.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.217
I'm designing a camp knife.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.384
It's really good
at chopping wood.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.253
It's got a bit of a recurve.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.522
Really just a utility knife
on crack.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.790
I could draw in some inclusion.
[both laugh]

02:36.824 --> 02:38.792
- I know the test is gonna be

02:38.826 --> 02:41.495
a cable chop
and a firehose slice,

02:41.529 --> 02:45.199
so I instantly thought about
a competition-style cleaver.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.335
Very basic.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.403
The only thing is then
get that cable to cooperate.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.905
- We've worked with cable
here in the Forge before,

02:51.939 --> 02:54.708
and it's always
a very complicated process.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.377
- That's the thing.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.579
If you try to
shortcut it for time,

02:58.612 --> 02:59.980
it all goes to hell.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.782
- I'm gonna make
a recurve bowie

03:01.815 --> 03:03.551
with a lot of swell
towards the front,

03:03.584 --> 03:05.653
so that it has
a lot of chopping power.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.222
Not been doing this very long,
so I stumble all over myself,

03:08.256 --> 03:09.890
and people sometimes
underestimate me

03:09.923 --> 03:12.293
or think that I'm weird,
but at the end of the day,

03:12.326 --> 03:14.595
I bring a lot of creativity
to the table.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.497
- Are you gonna do a recurve?
- Yeah.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.832
- I'm gonna do straight
and to the point, I think.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.868
Because we're working
with cable,

03:20.901 --> 03:22.736
I'm gonna spend less time
on the actual design

03:22.770 --> 03:24.438
of the knife,
and most of my time

03:24.472 --> 03:26.474
getting a solid bar of steel.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.276
I'm gonna make
a really basic chopping knife,

03:28.309 --> 03:30.311
simple drop point blade.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.480
- Bladesmiths, your ten minute
design window has closed.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.816
Your three-hour forge time
starts now.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.285
*

03:37.318 --> 03:38.986
Now this is obviously something

03:39.019 --> 03:41.922
you would want to work with
another smith and accomplish.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.424
- There's no choice.
They have to.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.426
- Ah, [bleep].
- Oh, my God.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.261
- Just rotate it.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.829
- Look at Robert go.
- That's awesome.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.564
- Carry that right on around.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.799
- We got her?

03:51.832 --> 03:54.568
- Yeah, man, look at 'em go!

03:54.602 --> 03:55.736
- There we go.
- All right, chop saw.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.338
*

03:57.371 --> 03:58.672
- That was just so smart,

03:58.706 --> 04:01.542
the way they pulled
that cable out.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.411
- Welder.
- How critical is it

04:03.444 --> 04:06.514
to weld all of those strands

04:06.547 --> 04:07.981
together on the end?

04:08.015 --> 04:10.050
- You put this cable
in the forge,

04:10.083 --> 04:12.353
metal heats expands,

04:12.386 --> 04:14.788
so those threads will start
pushing away from each other.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.957
It's one of those steps
where I just go ahead and do it,

04:16.990 --> 04:18.392
'cause it only take
a couple minutes,

04:18.426 --> 04:20.428
and it just secures it more.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.896
- My plan is to knock all of
the crud out of the cable

04:22.930 --> 04:26.400
on the inside of it,
so that I can get a clean weld.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.470
Get the grease out,
get the flux in.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.739
*

04:31.772 --> 04:34.542
- Is that a pyrometer?
- Paul, is that a pyrometer?

04:34.575 --> 04:36.477
- Yes, sir.
I like to know

04:36.510 --> 04:38.679
what temperature my steel is
before I quench it.

04:38.712 --> 04:39.947
*

04:39.980 --> 04:41.882
- Wow.
That's smart.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.584
- A lot of guys judge
the temperatures by color,

04:43.617 --> 04:45.586
but when you're forge welding,

04:45.619 --> 04:47.087
I really like to know
exactly what the temperature is.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.789
- Wow, J,
I've never seen you have

04:48.822 --> 04:50.824
a total man crush on
somebody's answer.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.394
[both laugh]

04:53.427 --> 04:55.028
- Well, actually,
I'm about to break that crush.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.731
I applaud Paul
for bringing the pyrometer,

04:57.765 --> 04:59.333
but it also is a sign
of somebody

04:59.367 --> 05:01.335
who's probably
really meticulous.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.737
And I'm watching Paul trying to
scrub this cable clean,

05:03.771 --> 05:05.506
and that's time wasted.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.575
It's easier to just
heat it up a little bit,

05:07.608 --> 05:09.943
tap it slightly open

05:09.977 --> 05:11.579
to get all that heat in there,
cook all of that out,

05:11.612 --> 05:13.781
and then twist it close.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.584
- Stuff is dirty.
Gonna weld.

05:16.617 --> 05:19.820
The hardest part about
using cable to make steel

05:19.853 --> 05:21.622
is making sure that
welds will stick,

05:21.655 --> 05:23.023
and I'm afraid that
it's just not clean enough.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.659
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.862
- Oh...
- Oh, my goodnes man.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.398
- That didn't work.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.366
It just falls all apart.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.569
I should've waited
to work on this.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.371
- To twist this cable,
you have to get it up to heat.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.139
*

05:39.172 --> 05:40.508
- Oh, hell.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.544
- Yeah, this is done.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.547
You know, I can grab another
piece of cable and start again,

05:46.580 --> 05:49.082
but I don't like
the cable to begin with

05:49.116 --> 05:51.118
in terms of its cleanliness,
you know?

05:51.151 --> 05:53.987
I just decided
it's gonna be a canister.

05:54.021 --> 05:57.458
- It's a workaround,
but is it a legit workaround?

05:57.491 --> 05:59.860
- We didn't say they needed
to make cable Damascus;

05:59.893 --> 06:03.130
we said they needed to
work with that cable.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.165
- Canister Damascus is something
I've never done before,

06:05.198 --> 06:08.436
but I just feel like
the process is more fool-proof

06:08.469 --> 06:12.039
than taking a risk on
the cable just not welding well.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.106
- Something that
he's never done before.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.708
It's a ballsy move.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.444
- Steven doesn't have the time

06:16.477 --> 06:18.746
to make a mistake
with a canister.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.749
That is a lot of pressure.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.417
- That's my new plan.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.085
- Let's just look over here
at Robert.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.888
He's got the huge pipe wrench...
- Yep.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.023
- On that cable,
and he's twisting it up.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.792
That's what we expect to see,
is it not?

06:31.825 --> 06:33.794
- Right, if you do
the cable properly,

06:33.827 --> 06:35.696
as you twist it,

06:35.729 --> 06:37.197
it'll actually start
forge welding.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.600
- Wow.

06:39.633 --> 06:42.002
- Yeah, you see, Paul,
everything's staying tight.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.104
He put a lot of weld
on the ends.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.739
See, there's the difference

06:45.773 --> 06:47.475
between Paul and Ryan
right there.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.176
*

06:49.209 --> 06:51.479
- One of the big problems
with doing cable Damascus

06:51.512 --> 06:53.113
is it tends to unravel.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.516
I know that these ends
have to be welded up

06:55.549 --> 06:57.451
to do a good forge weld on it.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.553
Hopefully, I can get it looking
like a square bar stock.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.822
- You have only
two hours remaining

07:01.855 --> 07:04.157
to finish your work!

07:04.191 --> 07:06.126
- Steven doesn't even have
anything in the fire.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.861
- Not good.
- So far behind

07:07.895 --> 07:10.764
all of our other smiths
at this point.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.900
Steven!

07:12.933 --> 07:15.068
- I know, yeah.
Yeah.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.671
I have my canister packed
as tightly as I can get it

07:17.705 --> 07:20.007
with clean pieces of cable
and powdered steel.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.943
The weld, the lid on it,

07:22.976 --> 07:25.813
I get that sucker in the forge,
and the heat is on.

07:25.846 --> 07:26.847
*

07:26.880 --> 07:28.582
- Crap.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.618
Yeah, that end's
coming unwelded.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.487
- Paul has probably the nicest
billet of steel out there,

07:33.521 --> 07:35.789
and he's worrying about
teeny little hairs

07:35.823 --> 07:37.725
on the outside of that billet.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.928
- If I don't spend the time
to get a solid bar,

07:40.961 --> 07:42.730
there's no knife gonna happen,

07:42.763 --> 07:44.632
so that's really
where I'm focusing my time.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.967
- I'm all for meticulous work,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.202
but this is
a three-hour challenge,

07:49.236 --> 07:52.940
But they have flyaways,
like Dave's wild eyebrows.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.575
You should be
able to just chop 'em off

07:54.608 --> 07:56.644
once you start to get
things welded up.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.045
- That's all right.
Sometimes, these cables

07:58.078 --> 08:00.147
can splinter,
like J's personality.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.583
[all laugh]

08:02.616 --> 08:04.752
*

08:04.785 --> 08:06.887
- I might have to fold this.
It's not light enough.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.722
*

08:08.756 --> 08:10.157
It's getting
a little longer and leaner

08:10.190 --> 08:12.225
than I really want.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.028
I have to fold it
and get it thick enough,

08:15.062 --> 08:16.897
so that I'd have
something to work with.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.232
*

08:19.266 --> 08:22.302
all: Oh!
[all laugh]

08:22.335 --> 08:24.071
- Who designed that hammer?

08:24.104 --> 08:26.006
- That's a guy
who hits metal hard.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.007
- Yeah.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.777
*

08:29.810 --> 08:32.646
- Ah! Ugly.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.248
As I heat it up, pieces are
popping out all over the place.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.884
Coming a bit unraveled...
- Yeah, I know.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.819
- Me and the steel.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.020
If they're running through
the entire blade

08:40.053 --> 08:41.722
or along the cutting edge,

08:41.755 --> 08:43.624
they're gonna create weak spots.

08:43.657 --> 08:46.026
It won't pass the test;
it will not move on.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.929
I need to assess what I've got.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.231
I need to know
if this billet's solid.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.100
[groans]

08:53.133 --> 08:55.068
Everywhere.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.871
- We're asking for
a longer blade,

08:57.905 --> 09:00.207
14 to 16 inches.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.809
If these guys got too many
of these flyaways

09:01.842 --> 09:03.310
they have to cut off...
- Yeah, yeah.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.012
- They have to make sure
they have enough feel.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.880
- Hopefully I've got enough
still underneath

09:06.914 --> 09:10.017
that I can salvage this piece
that I'm working on.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.820
*

09:12.853 --> 09:14.688
- Oh...
- What the heck is Steven doing?

09:14.722 --> 09:16.356
He's just standing there,
watching everybody else.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.258
- I give the canister
30 minutes in the forge,

09:18.291 --> 09:20.928
because I want that thing
to be hot enough

09:20.961 --> 09:22.896
to set the weld.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.998
So for that 30 minutes,
I'm sitting here sweating.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.867
- Oh, my God, man.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.002
- It's not going to
weld itself together.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.104
- I'm sitting here, stringing
curse words together to myself.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.073
- Steven!
You all right?

09:33.106 --> 09:35.108
- Yeah,
I'm just waiting for heat.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.310
- Just making sure.
- Yeah, I--

09:37.344 --> 09:39.246
I'm not looking
very smart right now.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.148
- It's gotta be hot, right?
- It has got to be hot.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.384
- I can't really see
if it's hot enough or not.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.754
I'll do it.
Don't screw this up.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.055
- Here we go.
Steven's on the move.

09:48.088 --> 09:54.628
*

09:54.662 --> 09:56.697
- Oh, no.
- Oh, there went that.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.232
[bleep].
Not welded.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.369
- Steven's shaking his head,
but, like, it looks pretty good.

10:02.402 --> 10:05.172
- I think he's in panic
shutdown mode, is what I think.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.040
- I've never done
a canister before.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.976
I'm really concerned
that it's not welded.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.778
Time is running out.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.646
Without a good solid
piece of steel,

10:12.680 --> 10:14.181
I can't present anything.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.120
- Here we go.
Steven's on the move.istake.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.757
- I can't really see
if it's hot enough or not.

10:23.791 --> 10:26.026
*

10:26.059 --> 10:27.961
Well, there went that.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.663
- I hope it's nothing serious.
- Whoa.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.732
- Not welded.
[bleep].

10:31.765 --> 10:33.901
- Steven's shaking his head,
but, like, it looks pretty good.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.302
- Yeah, I'd keep going.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.037
- Got plenty of heat
in there, right?

10:37.070 --> 10:39.139
- Oh, yeah.
- Do you think that's set, Paul?

10:39.172 --> 10:41.241
I have no idea what a set weld
on a canister looks like.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.676
- I would heat it
all the way up

10:42.710 --> 10:44.978
and give it another squeeze.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.179
- At this point,
I'm like, "Well, [bleep],

10:46.213 --> 10:47.915
I guess I gotta keep trying."

10:47.948 --> 10:50.684
- He's gotta really get moving
on that steel.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.986
- If this canister doesn't work,

10:53.020 --> 10:55.022
he may be
out of this competition.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.057
*

10:57.090 --> 10:59.059
Two hours has elapsed!

10:59.092 --> 11:01.461
- All right, I'm gonna go
a different route here.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.864
I think I'm gonna have to
just go to the grinder.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.432
I've just got inclusions
from the edge

11:05.465 --> 11:07.234
all the way through
to the spine,

11:07.267 --> 11:09.002
so I'm gonna grind on it

11:09.036 --> 11:11.071
until I get the best
blade I can make.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.140
Hoping there's something
alive inside.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.975
- There's a lot of
scoring and lines.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.744
Hopefully they don't go deep.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.012
[tense music]

11:19.046 --> 11:22.149
- Steven,
who's never done a canister,

11:22.182 --> 11:24.785
is trying to play catch up
right now.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.386
He needs
to get moving on this.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.288
- He needs to get
the canister out, though.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.891
- No, why?
- But he does have to expose

11:30.924 --> 11:33.961
a hardened edge, because
the can itself is soft steel.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.329
- Yeah, but he can do that
when he grinds the blade.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.165
- Get the canister off?

11:38.198 --> 11:40.000
- No, I'm just cutting
the corner of it off.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.902
The welds held,
and so at this point,

11:41.935 --> 11:44.237
I've taken what should have been
a generous window

11:44.271 --> 11:47.207
for my forging time
down to a frog's hair...

11:47.240 --> 11:49.977
[laughs]
You know, on the back end.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.312
Does not need to be perfect.
It needs to be done.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.314
[rock music]

11:54.347 --> 11:55.983
- He's gotta be fast.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.885
He's gotta catch up
to these other smiths.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.854
*

12:00.888 --> 12:02.255
- I'm not out of the woods yet.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.924
I still need to
harden this blade.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.259
*

12:06.293 --> 12:08.361
- I'm pleased with the shape,

12:08.395 --> 12:10.831
and I've gotta get
this thing in the oil.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.166
*

12:13.200 --> 12:15.168
Pull it out, and I got a warp.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.871
Fortunately, it's still warm.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.472
I can move it.
- You don't very often see

12:19.506 --> 12:21.508
a smith smacking on a blade
with a hammer

12:21.541 --> 12:23.076
right after he quenched it.
- Because there's a chance

12:23.110 --> 12:24.377
of shattering the blade.
Is that correct?

12:24.411 --> 12:25.378
- Yeah, yeah.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.847
*

12:26.880 --> 12:28.481
- Paul getting ready.

12:28.515 --> 12:35.555
*

12:35.588 --> 12:38.291
- Blades hard,
and I'm like, "Yeah,

12:38.325 --> 12:39.459
that's what I'm here to do."

12:39.492 --> 12:41.294
*

12:41.328 --> 12:43.797
- Steve just quenched his blade.

12:43.831 --> 12:46.199
- Steven has made up
a lot of ground here.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.435
*

12:48.468 --> 12:50.403
- Ryan has quenched.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.872
[flames whoosh]

12:51.905 --> 12:53.874
- Fire, fire, fire!

12:53.907 --> 12:55.375
- Doug's just here
for the quench.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.177
*

12:57.210 --> 13:00.147
- Ten, nine, eight,

13:00.180 --> 13:02.149
seven, six,

13:02.182 --> 13:05.118
five, four, three,

13:05.152 --> 13:07.520
two, one!

13:07.554 --> 13:09.222
*

13:09.256 --> 13:10.958
Bladesmiths,
shut down your machines,

13:10.991 --> 13:12.926
'cause this round is over!

13:12.960 --> 13:13.994
*

13:14.027 --> 13:15.528
- Holy [bleep].

13:15.562 --> 13:18.031
Times up, and my blade is fugly.
[chuckles]

13:18.065 --> 13:21.201
I'm just glad I have something
at this point.

13:21.234 --> 13:24.271
- There's just that little thing
in the back of my mind

13:24.304 --> 13:27.507
saying, "You have a warp.
You're not done yet."

13:27.540 --> 13:29.242
[tense music]

13:29.276 --> 13:30.978
- Bladesmiths,
it's time for the judges

13:31.011 --> 13:32.913
to take a closer look
at your work.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.148
Robert, you're up first.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.184
*

13:37.217 --> 13:39.286
- I do like that shape,
that kinda bush knife.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.121
Got a bit of, like, an S to it.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.090
It doesn't look far enough out

13:43.123 --> 13:44.925
that you probably couldn't
grind that out, though.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.427
- You also broke a hammer
out there on the floor, right?

13:47.460 --> 13:48.996
- Just one.
- Just one.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.464
- [laughs]
- So it was an easy day.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.066
- Ryan, you're up.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.202
*

13:55.235 --> 13:57.204
- First off, Ryan,
I love the drop in the handle,

13:57.237 --> 13:59.606
especially for the test
that we're gonna be doing.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.441
That being said,

14:01.474 --> 14:04.177
you've got a lot of
loose metal here still.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.613
I always get nervous when I can
play music on a knife.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.381
*

14:08.415 --> 14:09.883
- Paul, you're up.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.919
*

14:11.952 --> 14:14.154
- Your steel does look
really good.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.989
I mean, I can still see that
cable moving through it there,

14:16.023 --> 14:18.525
but I can't get a fingernail
in any of that, so...

14:18.558 --> 14:20.627
There's a bit of a warp there,

14:20.660 --> 14:22.295
but it's very small.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.464
All in all,
it came together well.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.533
- Thank you.
- Steven...

14:26.566 --> 14:28.969
*

14:29.002 --> 14:32.605
- Well, Steven, you had a total
catastrophe with the cable,

14:32.639 --> 14:35.442
but then you came up with,
as Dave calls, a workaround.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.144
The steel looks good.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.612
My big concern is this, though.

14:39.646 --> 14:43.583
That is not a knife edge.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.954
- Gentlemen, while the judges
go into deliberation,

14:46.987 --> 14:49.089
I'm gonna ask you to leave
your blades here on this table.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.258
Thank you.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.928
*

14:54.962 --> 14:56.463
Okay, so judges,

14:56.496 --> 14:59.099
I would assume that
Paul and Robert

14:59.132 --> 15:02.002
in this particular round
of competition are safe.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.603
Does everybody agree with that?
- Oh, yeah.

15:03.636 --> 15:07.074
- So that leaves
Ryan and Steven.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.442
Let's take a look at Ryan's.
- Uh-oh.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.278
- I love the shape.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.947
The scale of his handle
is really dialed in.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.582
But this has not
been welded into

15:15.615 --> 15:18.151
a homogenous piece of metal.

15:18.185 --> 15:20.553
- There is just so many
structural issues.

15:20.587 --> 15:24.724
There's a minimum of
five creases in this blade edge.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.261
I mean, right here, there is
just a chunk that's gone.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.197
- All right, let's take
a look at Steven's blade.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.631
Doug?

15:31.664 --> 15:33.400
*

15:33.433 --> 15:36.436
- You've got cable,
cable, cable,

15:36.469 --> 15:38.972
canister Damascus, what?

15:39.006 --> 15:40.207
It's one of the harder
challenges,

15:40.240 --> 15:42.042
and he's never done one.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.376
- I wanna know
why everybody wants to learn

15:43.410 --> 15:45.045
how to do canisters
on our show.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.679
[all laugh]

15:46.713 --> 15:49.549
- You're my hero, man,
on that canister.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.652
- What there is of a design here
is pretty poor.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.222
That being said,
the steel is solid.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.024
Structurally, it looks good.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.525
- Okay, have you made
your final decision?

15:58.558 --> 16:00.727
- Oh, yeah.
- Let's go tell our smiths.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.729
*

16:02.762 --> 16:05.698
Bladesmiths, the judges have
made their final decision,

16:05.732 --> 16:08.568
and it's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.004
*

16:11.038 --> 16:14.407
Ryan, your blade
did not make the cut.

16:14.441 --> 16:17.477
- You know, Ryan, I loved the
way your blade was progressing,

16:17.510 --> 16:19.146
but one of the biggest keys
in a functioning knife

16:19.179 --> 16:21.214
is structural integrity,

16:21.248 --> 16:23.083
and with all the seams
and pieces flaking up,

16:23.116 --> 16:24.717
your blade just doesn't have
that integrity,

16:24.751 --> 16:26.519
so that's why we have to
send you home.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.121
- I understand.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.656
- Ryan, please surrender
your blade.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.124
*

16:31.158 --> 16:33.093
- I feel upset, obviously.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.727
I would like to have
put out a better blade.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.663
- Cool shape, man.
- Thank you.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.198
You can't have a good blade
without good steel,

16:38.231 --> 16:40.033
and it definitely
was not good steel.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.601
Because I failed so horribly,

16:41.634 --> 16:44.404
I will go home
and do it 20 times,

16:44.437 --> 16:46.306
so that I can do it right.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.675
- Congratulations, bladesmiths,

16:48.708 --> 16:50.810
you've made it into the second
round of this competition.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.146
Now it's time
to turn your blades

16:53.180 --> 16:56.083
into fully functional weapons
by attaching handles to them

16:56.116 --> 16:58.351
using the range of materials
provided in our pantry.

16:58.385 --> 17:01.621
You will have four hours
in this round.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.790
However, there's a twist.

17:03.823 --> 17:06.059
In exchange for
this additional hour,

17:06.093 --> 17:07.527
you're also gonna
have to construct

17:07.560 --> 17:11.431
at least one mosaic pin
in your handles.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.367
A hollow pin with
a custom decorative inlay

17:14.401 --> 17:18.138
that you will design using
the tubes and metals provided.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.240
- I've never done
mosaic pins before,

17:20.273 --> 17:23.076
and so I'm somewhat worried.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.145
- After the time runs out,

17:25.178 --> 17:27.814
your weapons will be tested
for strength and durability

17:27.847 --> 17:31.218
in a cable wire chop,

17:31.251 --> 17:34.087
and for edge retention
in a firehose slice.

17:34.121 --> 17:38.491
Good luck, bladesmiths.
Your four hours starts now.

17:38.525 --> 17:39.692
*

17:39.726 --> 17:41.628
We have a four hour challenge.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.530
What are we giving these smiths
an additional hour for?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.798
- Mosaic pins are incredibly
tough to do for some people.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.201
I mean, it's a fairly
simple concept,

17:48.235 --> 17:50.470
but we've seen that sometimes
somebody attempts something

17:50.503 --> 17:53.573
they haven't before, and make
a hot sticky mess out of it.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.575
- [groans]
The difficult part

17:55.608 --> 17:58.745
in making a mosaic pin
is how to get the resin

17:58.778 --> 18:00.880
to go completely through,

18:00.913 --> 18:04.384
without leaving air pockets.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.419
But the hardest part for me

18:06.453 --> 18:09.156
is going to be getting
my blade straight.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.291
So my plan for round two

18:11.324 --> 18:14.227
is to set up everything
for the handle first.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.762
Get that out of the way,

18:15.795 --> 18:17.697
and then get to the blade.

18:17.730 --> 18:21.168
*

18:21.201 --> 18:22.835
- If I was gonna make
a mosaic pin in my shop,

18:22.869 --> 18:24.704
I would've laid out
a design on paper

18:24.737 --> 18:26.906
and used geometry.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.909
Here, I just have to make
something look pretty good,

18:29.942 --> 18:34.314
so I'm making, like, a dark spot
next to some light pins

18:34.347 --> 18:36.216
that are in kind of
an orbital pattern around it.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.618
Messy, nasty stuff.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.354
So I've got the epoxy in, and
it's not really going my way.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.156
If those pins start
sliding around in there,

18:43.190 --> 18:44.657
when they're doing
the chopping test,

18:44.691 --> 18:46.659
I'm gonna get called out
on it really quick.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.562
- I got by by the skin
of my teeth in round one,

18:49.596 --> 18:52.732
so I wanna prove
that I can hang.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.934
J was really displeased
with the blade shape,

18:54.967 --> 18:58.838
so my plan for this round is
to completely reshape the blade.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.408
If I put a slight recurve in it,

19:01.441 --> 19:02.809
I can make a powerful chopper

19:02.842 --> 19:04.777
that will also cut
more efficiently.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.579
- It was a sharp "spa-tula."

19:07.614 --> 19:09.549
- [chuckles]
Spatula.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.284
- Spat--spatula.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.452
[all laugh]

19:12.485 --> 19:14.654
- One hour has elapsed!

19:14.687 --> 19:17.224
What's Robert doing?

19:17.257 --> 19:19.592
- I wanna get that warp
out of the blade.

19:19.626 --> 19:24.464
I know that I can just
gently urge it into position.

19:24.497 --> 19:28.468
- The risk of snapping a blade
at this stage is higher.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.303
- Don't do that.

19:30.337 --> 19:33.540
- It's starting to get
the bends out of it.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.775
- [groaning]

19:38.245 --> 19:40.713
- I wanna get that warp
out of the blade.

19:40.747 --> 19:41.681
- Don't do that.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.783
*

19:43.816 --> 19:46.553
both: Oh!
- Robert just snapped his blade.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.255
- Oh, damn.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.423
- Yep.
Look at this.

19:50.457 --> 19:53.526
- Oh, my gosh.
Time for creativity, man.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.328
- Yep,
that's what I'm thinking.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.830
A lot of people affectionately
call me MacGyver.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.967
Pretty much make anything
out of anything.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.337
The warrior inside of me
just can't quit.

20:04.371 --> 20:08.341
How do I get this blade
back together strong,

20:08.375 --> 20:10.277
so that it can be tested?

20:10.310 --> 20:12.245
What do you do with a break
out in the woods?

20:12.279 --> 20:13.280
You put a splint on it.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.382
*

20:15.415 --> 20:18.017
I find a piece of flat bar
to splint this with.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.587
You know,
just insert that blade into it,

20:20.620 --> 20:22.322
and I can solder it.

20:22.355 --> 20:23.790
- How does solder create

20:23.823 --> 20:25.892
the strength and integrity
that he needs?

20:25.925 --> 20:28.895
- Soldering it
is not gonna make

20:28.928 --> 20:30.730
as much heat as welding would.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.833
It's less likely
he's gonna burn up the blade.

20:33.866 --> 20:37.003
- You have only two hours
remaining!

20:37.036 --> 20:40.740
- My next step is to start
figuring out this handle.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.476
I wanna make a hidden tang
handle on my knife,

20:43.510 --> 20:46.946
but none of the handle material
is wide enough.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.948
So I'm gonna make a frame handle

20:48.981 --> 20:50.883
that has a little notch
that walks under the tang,

20:50.917 --> 20:53.052
so that I won't have
to pin the centerpiece in.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.523
It'll be locked in by the pin
that I put in the tang.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.359
I really wanna present a handle
that I feel like is functional.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.561
*

21:01.594 --> 21:02.995
- When I see
Robert's blade break,

21:03.029 --> 21:04.531
I know that there's
definitely a chance

21:04.564 --> 21:06.299
that that could happen to me.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.635
A warped blade
is a serious issue.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.570
It's something that I would
never let get out of my shop,

21:10.603 --> 21:12.472
and I know that the judges
would pick up on that.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.874
- Paul fretting over
a little wiggle in his blade,

21:14.907 --> 21:17.577
torching it,
and possibly compromising

21:17.610 --> 21:19.746
the structural integrity of it.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.080
- I have to really be careful
how much pressure

21:21.113 --> 21:22.915
I put on that blade.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.083
Oh, my God.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.519
*

21:26.553 --> 21:29.522
- This would be very memorable
if we had two snapped blades.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.491
- Still just a little bit,

21:31.524 --> 21:33.560
but I think it's a lot better
than it was before.

21:33.593 --> 21:34.761
*

21:34.794 --> 21:35.862
Okay.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.397
*

21:37.430 --> 21:39.031
- While my epoxy's drying,

21:39.065 --> 21:41.067
it seems like a good time
to start figuring out

21:41.100 --> 21:43.336
what I'm gonna put
in my mosaic pin.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.705
I figure the more stuff
I put in here,

21:45.738 --> 21:47.807
the less void I have to fill,

21:47.840 --> 21:50.343
and so I tried to fit
as many things as I could in,

21:50.377 --> 21:52.479
in kind of a neat
little pattern.

21:52.512 --> 21:55.615
Now I got it everywhere.
I'm sorry about that.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.551
- I now have a functional blade.

21:58.585 --> 22:01.087
It's an ugly baby,
but it's my baby.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.656
We'll see if it stands up
to the judges.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.892
I'm gonna use every last second

22:05.925 --> 22:07.994
to get this handle right,

22:08.027 --> 22:10.129
and if I go home,

22:10.162 --> 22:12.665
I went out kicking.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.534
*

22:14.567 --> 22:16.369
- I'm gonna do
a full tang handle.

22:16.403 --> 22:18.638
A mosaic pin works very well
with a full tang handle,

22:18.671 --> 22:20.740
because you can just
drill large holes,

22:20.773 --> 22:24.143
and you can create a three-layer
sandwich for the handle,

22:24.176 --> 22:27.680
and the mosaic pin will help
structurally lock that together.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.416
- I hope he's got
enough material there,

22:29.449 --> 22:31.083
so he doesn't make
too skinny of a handle.

22:31.117 --> 22:33.486
*

22:33.520 --> 22:36.489
- Ten, nine, eight,

22:36.523 --> 22:38.057
seven, six,

22:38.090 --> 22:41.428
five, four, three,

22:41.461 --> 22:43.496
two, one!

22:43.530 --> 22:45.932
Bladesmiths, shut down
your machines, drop your tools.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.034
This round is over.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.569
*

22:49.602 --> 22:51.137
- I'm looking at the splint.

22:51.170 --> 22:54.140
I'm still concerned
it's a weak spot.

22:54.173 --> 22:56.175
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to our strength test,

22:56.208 --> 22:58.478
the wire cable chop.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.146
I'm gonna take
each of your blades,

23:00.179 --> 23:02.715
and I'm gonna baton them
three times

23:02.749 --> 23:04.951
at three different points.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.754
Now keep in mind, it's not what
your blade can do to this cable.

23:07.787 --> 23:10.122
It's what the cable's
gonna do to your blades.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.991
Steven, what do you think?

23:12.024 --> 23:14.561
- I think we might be
in trouble. [laughs]

23:14.594 --> 23:15.828
*

23:15.862 --> 23:17.764
When I see the cable wire,

23:17.797 --> 23:19.532
I'm even more worried
than I was before,

23:19.566 --> 23:22.134
because it's so thick,
there's a good chance

23:22.168 --> 23:23.636
that my blade will just
snap in half.

23:23.670 --> 23:30.610
*

23:34.080 --> 23:36.683
[all chuckle]

23:36.716 --> 23:38.485
*

23:38.518 --> 23:40.119
- Well, Steven,
it held up pretty well.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.654
You do have some wrinkling,

23:41.688 --> 23:43.556
especially on
the first two strikes.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.692
The third one, not as much.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.894
But the handle's nice and tight.

23:47.927 --> 23:48.995
Nice job.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.763
*

23:50.797 --> 23:52.499
So you saw that, Paul.
What are you thinking?

23:52.532 --> 23:54.934
You ready?
- Uh, I'm as ready as I can be.

23:54.967 --> 24:01.908
*

24:11.083 --> 24:13.720
- Well, Paul, you definitely
have some chipping

24:13.753 --> 24:15.187
out on the edge here,

24:15.221 --> 24:18.658
especially on
the last two strikes.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.159
But it stayed in alignment.

24:20.192 --> 24:23.095
Everything's tight.
Nice job.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.797
What are you thinking, Robert?

24:24.831 --> 24:26.599
- Well, the steam hammer
in my chest says,

24:26.633 --> 24:28.034
"Let's get her done."

24:28.067 --> 24:29.902
*

24:29.936 --> 24:32.772
Well, that's it.
It's gonna break.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.542
There's no way
he can put that weak spot

24:35.575 --> 24:39.045
on hardened cable
and it'll stay.

24:39.078 --> 24:46.018
*

24:51.223 --> 24:53.760
- Well, Robert, it survived,

24:53.793 --> 24:56.696
but that crack at the edge
has opened up now.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.898
There's definitely
separation damage

24:58.931 --> 25:00.833
from the initial break.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.602
Definitely had it chipping out

25:02.635 --> 25:04.671
on the three spots
where I struck.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.238
That being said,

25:06.272 --> 25:08.174
you made the best
of a bad situation.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.242
Good job.
- Thank you.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.578
- Doug...

25:11.611 --> 25:13.112
*

25:13.145 --> 25:15.748
- Bladesmiths,
this is the sharpness test.

25:15.782 --> 25:18.050
To see how sharp your blade is,
I will take your weapon

25:18.084 --> 25:20.987
and attempt to cut through
this firehose.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.121
Steven, you're up first.
You ready?

25:22.154 --> 25:24.190
- Yes, sir.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.559
In round one,
the judges didn't really like

25:26.593 --> 25:28.795
the little whoopty thing
in the edge.

25:28.828 --> 25:30.997
I was able to make
a lot of improvement,

25:31.030 --> 25:34.200
but there's always a chance
that something could go wrong.

25:34.233 --> 25:40.072
*

25:40.106 --> 25:42.241
- Wow.
- Okay, Steven...

25:42.274 --> 25:44.977
first of all, your handle,
it is wide.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.345
Because of its wideness,

25:46.378 --> 25:48.948
it keeps on wanting
to turn over.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.317
But barring that,
your edge is very sharp.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.152
Your blade will cut.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.320
- Thanks.

25:54.353 --> 25:56.589
- Paul, you're up next.

25:56.623 --> 26:03.329
*

26:08.334 --> 26:12.304
Okay, Paul, this feels
very good on the hand.

26:12.338 --> 26:15.074
Not only do I feel like
I can cut forward,

26:15.107 --> 26:17.644
but immediately I'm ready
to do follow-up thrusting

26:17.677 --> 26:19.178
for another slash.

26:19.211 --> 26:21.981
Overall, your blade will cut.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.650
- Thank you.
- Good job.

26:23.683 --> 26:27.019
- Thank you.
- Robert, you're up next.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.788
- Since that crack
opened up a bit,

26:28.821 --> 26:32.258
I'm really worried about
the blade catching

26:32.291 --> 26:34.293
and it just halting mid-stroke.

26:34.326 --> 26:37.664
If my blade doesn't stand up,
I'm out of here.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.802
- By the grace of God,
I need to get through
*

26:42.835 --> 26:46.172
just one more challenge.
This one challenge.

26:46.205 --> 26:49.141
[dramatic music]

26:49.175 --> 26:54.413
*

26:54.446 --> 26:57.817
- Okay, Robert, your design here
is nice, clean arc

26:57.850 --> 27:00.853
that allows for a good slice.

27:00.887 --> 27:02.655
You definitely gave us
a chopper here.

27:02.689 --> 27:04.891
Your weapon, sir, will cut.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.059
- Thank you.

27:07.093 --> 27:10.429
- There's no telling
what the judges will decide.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.965
All of us met the parameters
of the challenge

27:12.999 --> 27:15.001
and performed well,
so who the heck knows

27:15.034 --> 27:17.269
where this is going.

27:17.303 --> 27:20.372
- Bladesmiths, the judges have
made their final decision.

27:20.406 --> 27:23.743
It is time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

27:23.776 --> 27:28.180
*

27:28.214 --> 27:31.450
Robert, your blade
did not make the cut.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.820
- Robert, you did something
we've never had happen

27:33.853 --> 27:35.788
on this competition.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.924
You came back from
a catastrophic blade failure,

27:37.957 --> 27:40.026
found a workaround,
and actually made it

27:40.059 --> 27:41.728
into the testing of that weapon.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.262
But in the end, your blade

27:43.295 --> 27:45.031
took more damage
than the other blades,

27:45.064 --> 27:46.098
and that's why
we've gotta let you go.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.134
- Understand.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.136
- Robert,
please surrender your blade.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.438
- I would love to move on,

27:52.471 --> 27:56.075
but my best lessons
have been through failure,

27:56.108 --> 27:59.045
so just being here is a win.

27:59.078 --> 28:02.248
And my family, they'll be happy
I didn't give up.

28:02.281 --> 28:05.852
They'll just revert back to,
"Oh, yeah, that's MacGyver.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.319
He'll figure something out."

28:07.353 --> 28:09.756
*

28:09.789 --> 28:13.459
- Paul, Steven, congratulations,
you're both one step closer

28:13.492 --> 28:15.294
to the title of
"Forged in Fire" champion

28:15.327 --> 28:16.963
and a check for ten grand.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.831
All that you need to
do now is go home

28:18.865 --> 28:21.300
and recreate an iconic weapon
from history,

28:21.333 --> 28:22.735
and that weapon is...

28:22.769 --> 28:25.004
*

28:25.037 --> 28:27.874
The Ngombe Ngulu.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.876
- The Ngombe Ngulu
is a ceremonial sword

28:29.909 --> 28:31.744
made by the Ngombe tribe

28:31.778 --> 28:33.345
by the Democratic Republic
of the Congo.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.447
Featuring an ornate wooden hilt

28:35.481 --> 28:37.950
and an embellished
scythe-shaped blade,

28:37.984 --> 28:40.519
this intimidating weapon
was reputedly used

28:40.552 --> 28:43.322
around the late 19th century
for the sacrificial beheading

28:43.355 --> 28:45.157
of tribal slaves.

28:45.191 --> 28:47.126
The razor sharp
outer-edge of the hook

28:47.159 --> 28:49.295
was said to separate
the victim's head from his neck

28:49.328 --> 28:51.764
in one swift fatal strike.

28:51.798 --> 28:54.000
Following the abolition
of human sacrifice,

28:54.033 --> 28:56.869
the Ngulu transitioned
from executioner's weapon

28:56.903 --> 29:01.373
to an insignia of prestige
carried at ceremonial dances.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.876
- Um, Ngombe nooh-no?

29:03.910 --> 29:05.812
Ngombe...

29:05.845 --> 29:08.247
Ngombe nooh-no?
Whatever that is.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.116
- [laughs]
That's awesome.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.951
It is eerily reminiscent
of a Hungo Mungo,

29:11.984 --> 29:13.085
which I was kind of worried
about having to make

29:13.119 --> 29:14.821
something like that.

29:14.854 --> 29:15.888
- You will have five days
at your home forge

29:15.922 --> 29:17.256
to complete this challenge.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.125
At the end of those five days,

29:19.158 --> 29:20.526
you will return to present
your Ngombe Ngulus

29:20.559 --> 29:22.528
to our panel of expert judges.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.831
Good luck, bladesmiths.
We'll see you in five days.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.565
*

29:26.598 --> 29:29.836
[discordant rock music]

29:29.869 --> 29:32.371
- I wanna get going.
My shop is--

29:32.404 --> 29:35.842
I often refer to it
as a hobbit hole. [laughs]

29:35.875 --> 29:37.877
This is a fire-breathing spider

29:37.910 --> 29:39.445
that'll eat you alive.

29:39.478 --> 29:42.281
I make weird stuff,
and this is really weird.

29:42.314 --> 29:45.852
If that doesn't lop off a head,
I don't know what will.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.954
This blade is a really
difficult one to shade,

29:47.987 --> 29:49.521
'cause there's a lot of
curvature.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.290
To get a blade
like this to balance,

29:51.323 --> 29:53.192
I've gotta do
a lot of hammer work,

29:53.225 --> 29:55.261
and I've gotta be really careful
not to cancel out

29:55.294 --> 29:57.096
everything I do
on each hammer stroke.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.031
I definitely
feel like an underdog

29:59.065 --> 30:00.900
for no other reason
that I didn't get to show

30:00.933 --> 30:02.902
my ability to forge
in the first round,

30:02.935 --> 30:05.271
it's a great opportunity to show
that I do have some skill.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.406
It's really important to me
to win this

30:07.439 --> 30:09.475
so people remember
who Steven Bryan is.

30:09.508 --> 30:12.044
I will be
moderately Googleable.

30:12.078 --> 30:15.214
[slow rock music]

30:15.247 --> 30:18.084
- My competition is Steven,
who's a great young smith.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.286
He doesn't have the kind of
experience that I do,

30:20.319 --> 30:22.254
but none of us have any
experience

30:22.288 --> 30:25.391
making a Ngombe Ngulu,
so it's gonna be a tough race.

30:25.424 --> 30:28.560
It's such an usual shape.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.329
This is a very complicated
weapon,

30:30.362 --> 30:32.131
so I'm gonna have to be
really careful

30:32.164 --> 30:34.633
to make sure I go through
all the rules

30:34.666 --> 30:37.269
time and time again to make sure
that I don't miss anything.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.038
We've seen a lot of guys
that have gone down

30:39.071 --> 30:40.873
for issues of length or width.

30:40.907 --> 30:44.911
A Ngombe Ngulu has about 55%

30:44.944 --> 30:48.280
of its length in
the relatively straight section,

30:48.314 --> 30:50.917
and about 45% of its length

30:50.950 --> 30:53.385
in the curve section
towards the end.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.087
I'm deciding to use
a leaf spring.

30:55.121 --> 30:57.023
The Ngombe used
salvaged materials

30:57.056 --> 30:59.025
that already had holes
or shapes cut in it,

30:59.058 --> 31:00.659
and formed their pieces
around them.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.029
I'm gonna drop a drift
right down that hole,

31:03.062 --> 31:05.297
and just see if I can get
the hole to open up.

31:05.331 --> 31:07.633
I'm gonna try to achieve
good balance with this blade.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.668
It's a really unusual shape,

31:09.701 --> 31:11.103
so that it feels good
in the hand

31:11.137 --> 31:13.039
and that it will swing nicely.

31:13.072 --> 31:15.174
I'm feeling pretty good
right now. However...

31:15.207 --> 31:17.443
the biggest challenge for this
project is the heat treat.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.578
It definitely won't go
in the current opening.

31:19.611 --> 31:23.182
[tense music]

31:23.215 --> 31:24.650
[rock music]

31:24.683 --> 31:26.585
- Now I'm feeling the pressure,

31:26.618 --> 31:28.320
'cause I know that I have
a lot to do today.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.189
Propane, I need to heat
this sucker up.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.324
Time to heat treat.

31:32.358 --> 31:34.693
This is a really critical point
in this process.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.996
There's a lot
that could go wrong.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.430
If the blade's gonna fail,

31:38.464 --> 31:40.599
I will know very quickly
after it's hard.

31:40.632 --> 31:47.606
*

31:51.310 --> 31:52.578
There is a warp.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.480
[bleep].

31:54.513 --> 31:56.715
It's in the main section
of the blade.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.584
If I try to straighten it
and it cracks,

31:58.617 --> 31:59.651
I'm in trouble.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.287
Oh, [bleep].

32:01.988 --> 32:04.156
- Today, I'm gonna
have to heat treat.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.325
Pretty much have to widen
the whole top.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.560
I hate to take the time to
carve up my heat treat furnace,

32:08.594 --> 32:11.998
but I really don't have
any other options at this point.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.499
I'm feeling pretty nervous
right now.

32:13.532 --> 32:14.700
There's a lot
that could go wrong.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.268
I could get a really bad warp,

32:16.302 --> 32:18.237
or the blade
could fail to harden,

32:18.270 --> 32:19.605
and I'd have to start
the process over again.

32:19.638 --> 32:23.242
*

32:23.275 --> 32:26.212
Man, I hope that that's not,
like, an omen right there.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.479
*

32:27.513 --> 32:28.580
Oh, hell, I'm gonna go for it.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.282
That's good.

32:30.316 --> 32:33.219
[rock music]

32:33.252 --> 32:35.021
*

32:35.054 --> 32:36.755
It doesn't look
any worse than it did

32:36.788 --> 32:37.990
when I put it in.

32:38.024 --> 32:40.159
*

32:40.192 --> 32:41.327
That is such a huge relief.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.030
*

32:44.063 --> 32:46.032
- Today is the day
that everything has to be done.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.334
Yesterday I was able to get
all of the warp out

32:48.367 --> 32:50.602
in the temper.
That was a relief.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.072
I am putting the handle on
right now.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.074
I need to make sure
that I don't settle for gaps

32:55.107 --> 32:57.143
and misalignment.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.411
I highly doubt I'll hit
the marks that Paul will hit

32:59.445 --> 33:02.014
just because he has so much more
experience with fit and finish.

33:02.048 --> 33:04.083
And, so the stakes
are much higher.

33:04.116 --> 33:06.018
So this epoxy works very fast

33:06.052 --> 33:08.454
and I'm becoming very aware
of the closing

33:08.487 --> 33:10.489
window of time I have here
to get everything assembled.

33:10.522 --> 33:15.661
*

33:15.694 --> 33:17.529
Oh, [bleep].

33:17.563 --> 33:19.765
I cracked the last piece
in the handle.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.300
This is really, really bad.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.768
I am short on time for the day.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.303
I have to make a new piece

33:24.336 --> 33:26.004
or I'm not gonna have anything.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.576
A mistake has been made.
There's no going back.

33:30.609 --> 33:33.379
I have just enough
of African blackwood

33:33.412 --> 33:35.447
to replace my last piece
on my handle.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.516
At this point in time,
it's really precious.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.718
*

33:39.751 --> 33:41.420
- When I make knives,
I try and pay attention

33:41.453 --> 33:43.422
to the small details.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.591
I'll take the nickname
Captain Meticulous.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.659
The first thing I'm getting at
this morning are the globes

33:47.693 --> 33:49.628
that are a required element
on the end of the handle.

33:49.661 --> 33:52.231
The globes could be thought
of as a really large pommel.

33:52.264 --> 33:54.466
They're using wood instead
of metal as a counterweight.

33:54.500 --> 33:57.403
That'll make it really accurate
for the Ngombe Ngulu.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.438
We've got scales cut.

33:59.471 --> 34:02.608
I made a weighted pommel nut
to put on to the very end,

34:02.641 --> 34:05.144
so that I can dial in
the balance.

34:05.177 --> 34:08.114
I'm adding a leather spacer,
which will act like a cushion.

34:08.147 --> 34:11.217
This'll all dampen vibration
like a shock absorber.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.452
The last detail is doing
the leather handle wrap.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.487
It's gonna be a great grip.

34:15.521 --> 34:18.257
So this is a one-inch thick
manila rope.

34:18.290 --> 34:22.261
It's a standard test
for a lot of knife edge stuff.

34:22.294 --> 34:23.729
The worst case scenario
would be to find out

34:23.762 --> 34:25.131
that my edge doesn't hold up.

34:25.164 --> 34:27.099
Go about like that.

34:27.133 --> 34:28.634
Something like that
could send me home.

34:28.667 --> 34:29.835
And here we go.

34:29.868 --> 34:31.470
*

34:31.503 --> 34:33.372
[grunts]
And that is a pass.

34:34.506 --> 34:37.376
[tense music]

34:37.409 --> 34:40.479
- Bladesmiths,
welcome back to the Forge.

34:40.512 --> 34:41.613
You've had five days
at your home forges

34:41.647 --> 34:43.415
to work on your finale weapons.

34:43.449 --> 34:44.883
Paul, how did it go?
- It went pretty well.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.119
It's made out of
leaf spring steel.

34:47.153 --> 34:49.655
The grip is actually
wrapped with goatskin.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.890
The globes were turned from
bubinga wood,

34:51.923 --> 34:53.725
which is native to the Congo.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.195
And there's a pommel nut
on the end of that.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.563
- Nice.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.331
Steven, what do you got?

34:59.365 --> 35:01.333
- I've got a forged AC RV blade.

35:01.367 --> 35:02.734
It's a steel
that's pretty commonly used

35:02.768 --> 35:03.902
on swords right now.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.804
With a really beefy hidden tang,

35:05.837 --> 35:07.606
and through an African
blackwood handle.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.408
- All right, gentlemen,
you know what's next.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.543
The weapons test.
Dave...

35:11.577 --> 35:13.279
*

35:13.312 --> 35:14.746
- Gentlemen,
this is the sharpness test.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.515
To test the sharpness
of your blades,

35:16.548 --> 35:18.517
I'll be cutting into
our cane man here.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.686
Paul, you ready?
- Yes.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.621
I feel good.
I know that the geometry

35:22.654 --> 35:25.391
behind my edge
is thin and convex,

35:25.424 --> 35:27.259
so it should cut through
the cane very well.

35:27.293 --> 35:29.495
*

35:29.528 --> 35:32.398
[rock music]

35:32.431 --> 35:38.270
*

35:38.304 --> 35:41.640
- This is what I love to see
come back in the third round.

35:41.673 --> 35:45.244
This feels like a weapon;
it cuts like a weapon.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.513
It went right through that cane.
You nailed it.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.315
- Thank you.
- All right, Steven,

35:49.348 --> 35:51.250
you ready for this?
- Yes, sir.

35:51.283 --> 35:53.952
Dave is clearly excited
about Paul's blade,

35:53.985 --> 35:55.621
which is great for Paul.
I'm a little worried,

35:55.654 --> 35:56.855
'cause I wanna be excited
on my blade, too,

35:56.888 --> 35:58.257
but we'll see.

35:58.290 --> 36:01.193
[rock music]

36:01.227 --> 36:05.864
*

36:05.897 --> 36:08.767
Let's go.
- [laughs]

36:08.800 --> 36:11.970
- Your weapon, same weapon,
different feel.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.573
It's a different weight;
it's a different balance;

36:14.606 --> 36:16.808
but the cuts, you can see,
it just passed right through.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.844
There wasn't any resistance
on that cane.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.279
Nicely done.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.847
- That felt really good to hear.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.249
Never expected
to make it this far

36:23.282 --> 36:25.384
based on how round one went,

36:25.417 --> 36:28.387
and it just feels good to have
made something that's effective.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.988
- Gentlemen,
to test the strength

36:30.021 --> 36:31.757
and durability
of your blades,

36:31.790 --> 36:33.892
I'm gonna chop into
these clay pots.

36:33.925 --> 36:36.595
This is not about
what your blades do to the pots,

36:36.628 --> 36:38.530
but what these pots
can do to your blades.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.532
Paul, you're up first.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.468
- Hitting something
as hard as a clay pot,

36:42.501 --> 36:44.470
I don't have any idea
what it's gonna do to my edge.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.672
*

36:46.705 --> 36:49.608
[rock music]

36:49.641 --> 36:52.010
*

36:52.043 --> 36:54.813
- [chuckles]
That's pretty cool.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.682
- The balance is really nice
on this.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.484
It's heavy
where it needs to be heavy.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.486
When you're swinging it,
you know where it's going.

37:00.519 --> 37:03.389
But there's a slight roll
on the edge of your blade

37:03.422 --> 37:06.392
right here that--
I can get a fingernail on that.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.960
Everything down at the handle
and the guard are still tight.

37:08.994 --> 37:12.398
Yeah, other than that one roll,
it appears to have held up well.

37:12.431 --> 37:13.932
All right, Steven,
it's your turn.

37:13.965 --> 37:14.833
You ready for this?
- Yes, sir.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.368
- Okay.

37:16.402 --> 37:18.537
- Pretty concerned, because clay

37:18.570 --> 37:21.039
is really dense,
and it's really hard on an edge.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.875
And if it's gonna chip,
it's gonna chip hitting clay.

37:23.909 --> 37:30.649
[dramatic music]

37:30.682 --> 37:37.556
*

37:39.491 --> 37:40.659
- Cool.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.628
*

37:42.661 --> 37:44.363
- Nice and straight.

37:44.396 --> 37:46.432
I don't really see anything
out of alignment.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.568
Your blade's a little bit
heavier than Paul's,

37:49.601 --> 37:51.503
but it's got a good feel;
it's got a good balance.

37:51.537 --> 37:52.871
The wood you've got
on the handle,

37:52.904 --> 37:54.673
and the extension
of this handle,

37:54.706 --> 37:57.075
has put the balance
in a really nice place.

37:57.108 --> 38:00.312
Yeah, I can't feel any
deformation on the edge.

38:00.346 --> 38:01.880
Well done.
- Thank you.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.949
- Next up, the kill test.
Doug...

38:03.982 --> 38:05.984
*

38:06.017 --> 38:08.053
- I know what the weapon
was used for,

38:08.086 --> 38:10.556
and I'm starting to wonder
pretty hardcore

38:10.589 --> 38:13.659
what we're about to do
to these dummies.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.994
- Bladesmiths,
this is the kill test.

38:16.027 --> 38:17.763
The Ngombe Ngulu
wasn't just a weapon

38:17.796 --> 38:19.931
used by tribal chiefs
to show status.

38:19.965 --> 38:23.369
It was also known as the
beheading sword of the Congo.

38:23.402 --> 38:26.004
So to see what kinda lethal
damage your weapon will do,

38:26.037 --> 38:29.074
I will take your Ngombe Ngulu,
and I'll deliver lethal slashes

38:29.107 --> 38:31.343
on this ballistics dummy.

38:31.377 --> 38:33.745
And know, I'm gonna try
to take its head off.

38:33.779 --> 38:36.014
- Nice.
- [chuckles]

38:36.047 --> 38:38.750
They're gonna actually cut
the head off of this dummy.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.352
Who does that?

38:40.386 --> 38:41.987
*

38:42.020 --> 38:44.723
[rock music]

38:44.756 --> 38:45.857
Oh...

38:45.891 --> 38:51.797
*

38:51.830 --> 38:54.700
[laughter]
- Oh, my God.

38:56.468 --> 38:57.936
That was badass.
- All right, Paul,

38:57.969 --> 38:59.605
let's talk about
your Ngombe Ngulu.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.707
It feels good in the hand.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.742
It's got a razor-edge shear

39:03.775 --> 39:06.011
that upon its initial delivery
into the gut,

39:06.044 --> 39:09.581
that dug in deep
all the way into the bowel.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.917
- Yeah.
- Now for its intended purpose

39:11.950 --> 39:14.019
of going up to decapitate
the head,

39:14.052 --> 39:16.688
well, come on, it's got no head.
It's dead.

39:16.722 --> 39:20.058
- [laughs]
- Your weapon will kill.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.760
- Thank you.
- All right, Steven,

39:21.793 --> 39:23.529
it's your turn. You ready?
- Yes, sir.

39:23.562 --> 39:26.164
- I'm gonna head on over
and grab your sword.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.500
[both chuckle]
- I'm a nervous dude,

39:28.534 --> 39:31.603
and I really hope that
my blade hangs with his.

39:31.637 --> 39:38.577
*

39:44.916 --> 39:48.019
- All right, Steven.
Your blade is sharp.

39:48.053 --> 39:51.623
It lacerated all the way
into the bowels.

39:51.657 --> 39:53.525
As you can see,
that cut through the jaw

39:53.559 --> 39:55.060
and all the way
through the head.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.828
- [laughs]

39:56.862 --> 39:58.897
- The wood that you have here,
it's smooth,

39:58.930 --> 40:00.432
but it's the index here
that you have with that.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.000
The way you have it
flattened out, a void,

40:02.033 --> 40:04.536
that feels good in the hand.
- Yes, sir.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.838
- And it will kill.
- Thanks.

40:06.872 --> 40:08.674
We have such different blades,
and it's hard to know

40:08.707 --> 40:10.208
what the preference
will be on that.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.210
I mean, I feel like
my blade performed well,

40:12.243 --> 40:14.680
but they were very happy
with Paul's blade,

40:14.713 --> 40:17.816
so we're head-to-head,
no pun intended.

40:17.849 --> 40:19.785
[tense music]

40:19.818 --> 40:22.754
- Paul, Steven, the judges'
deliberation is complete,

40:22.788 --> 40:24.122
and they've made
their final decision,

40:24.155 --> 40:26.091
but before I give you
that decision,

40:26.124 --> 40:28.093
they have some feedback
for both of you.

40:28.126 --> 40:30.028
Doug...
- Paul, from the get-go,

40:30.061 --> 40:32.197
the way you're meticulous
about your work

40:32.230 --> 40:34.032
shows in the way
your Ngombe Ngulu showed up.

40:34.065 --> 40:36.001
The attention you put
on the handle,

40:36.034 --> 40:38.704
the leather wrapping,
and the way it feels

40:38.737 --> 40:40.539
made it a pleasure to wield.

40:40.572 --> 40:42.140
Steven, you persevered
all the way through

40:42.173 --> 40:44.175
and got you to the finals.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.478
Your personal look
put onto that Ngombe Ngulu

40:46.512 --> 40:48.747
made it beautiful to wield,

40:48.780 --> 40:50.616
and overall,
both your weapons live up to

40:50.649 --> 40:52.250
executioner's sword.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.586
Good job.
- Thank you.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.021
- Gentlemen,
in this competition,

40:56.054 --> 40:58.957
there can only be one champion.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.759
The "Forged in Fire"
champion is...

41:00.792 --> 41:07.098
*

41:07.132 --> 41:08.900
Steven, congratulations,

41:08.934 --> 41:11.703
you are the "Forged in Fire"
champion.

41:11.737 --> 41:14.773
Paul, unfortunately, your
weapon did not make the cut.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.508
- Paul, you both made
beautiful weapons,

41:16.542 --> 41:18.544
and they both performed
beautifully, too.

41:18.577 --> 41:22.047
So then we had to look at
the finest of details,

41:22.080 --> 41:24.215
and that rolled edge
on the strength test,

41:24.249 --> 41:26.151
well, that was
the deciding factor.

41:26.184 --> 41:27.886
So that's why we have to
send you home.

41:27.919 --> 41:30.756
- Understand.
- Paul, thank you very much

41:30.789 --> 41:32.290
for turning in such
a beautiful weapon,

41:32.323 --> 41:34.560
but now I have to ask you
to surrender it

41:34.593 --> 41:36.528
and please leave the Forge.

41:36.562 --> 41:37.996
- I certainly accept
the judges' decision.

41:38.029 --> 41:39.230
My edge rolled
and Steven's didn't.

41:39.264 --> 41:40.966
The judges had to make a call.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.233
I think that we made it
hard on them

41:42.267 --> 41:44.202
to decide between
the two of us,

41:44.235 --> 41:45.904
so it really did come back down
to that one detail.

41:45.937 --> 41:48.740
But I'm really happy that
the judges could see

41:48.774 --> 41:51.109
I bring a lot of thought and
purpose to the work that I do.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.912
First thing I'm gonna do
when I get home is clean my shop

41:53.945 --> 41:55.581
and get on with
what I usually make.

41:55.614 --> 41:57.182
*

41:57.215 --> 41:59.217
- Steven, congratulations,

41:59.250 --> 42:00.752
you are the "Forged in Fire"
champion and will be receiving

42:00.786 --> 42:04.155
a check for ten grand.
How do you feel?

42:04.189 --> 42:06.658
- I feel great. [laughs]
It's a little surreal.

42:06.692 --> 42:08.927
I damn well proved
what I came here to prove.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.696
I am creative,

42:10.729 --> 42:12.831
and I can make
a functional weapon,

42:12.864 --> 42:14.332
and that you don't have to be
the most experienced.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.101
If you put your heart
into stuff,

42:16.134 --> 42:18.003
things, you know,
can turn out well.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.572
It was fun as hell,
and I'm glad

42:20.606 --> 42:22.340
that I came out on top.

42:22.373 --> 42:26.912
*
