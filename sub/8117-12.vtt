WEBVTT

00:03.871 --> 00:06.474
I'm sorry.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.042
Don't be.

00:08.076 --> 00:10.078
You did what
everyone around here's

00:10.111 --> 00:12.913
been wanting to do for days.

00:15.049 --> 00:17.085
You take it way too easy on me.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.488
But I get it now.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.625
For the longest time, I was
so mad at you for going off

00:24.658 --> 00:28.162
on that population control
officer back in Chicago.

00:28.196 --> 00:31.499
Sometimes you can't help
yourself.

00:37.605 --> 00:41.842
You want the good news
or the bad news first, Sheriff.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.977
Surprise me.

00:44.011 --> 00:47.515
The good news is,
your son's free to go.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.085
No, I'm staying with him.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.386
Josh?

00:52.420 --> 00:54.955
Believe me, I wanted to kill
you, young Shannon, a lot.

00:54.988 --> 00:57.925
But, uh, I was, uh... I was

00:57.958 --> 01:00.794
persuaded otherwise.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.100
Dad?

01:06.134 --> 01:07.168
Dad? Dad!
Hey!

01:07.201 --> 01:09.203
Take it easy.
Dad!

01:09.237 --> 01:11.572
It's okay, Josh.
Don't, don't touch him!

01:12.906 --> 01:14.007
Cool toy.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.677
Isn't it?

01:20.948 --> 01:23.584
Where's my father?

01:40.268 --> 01:42.503
I don't know how you people
can stand this place.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.138
Hold still.

01:44.172 --> 01:47.308
Bugs the size of dogs,
plants that eat children.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.085
Why would anyone want to
live in this nightmare?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.978
What did you just give me?

01:51.011 --> 01:52.446
An antihistamine
for the itching.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.748
I'll take it from
here. Thank you, Nurse.

01:56.116 --> 01:59.987
Hello.
I'm Dr. Shannon.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.356
You feeling any better?

02:02.390 --> 02:06.126
No. If anything, the
itching just got worse.

02:06.160 --> 02:09.363
Have you ever heard of
Trichomonas sastrei?

02:09.396 --> 02:12.566
It's a parasite known to cause
heart lesions in slashers.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.603
In humans, the larvae attack
the central nervous system

02:15.636 --> 02:19.139
and sort of burrow their
way into the brain stem.

02:19.173 --> 02:22.075
From what I
understand, it's...

02:22.109 --> 02:24.245
quite an excruciating
way to die.

02:24.278 --> 02:27.715
Why are you telling me this?

02:27.748 --> 02:31.151
Because you've just been injected
with half a million Trichomonas larvae.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.321
I switched out your
antihistamine.

02:33.354 --> 02:36.224
Lucas Taylor is detaining
my husband,

02:36.257 --> 02:39.593
and you are gonna help
me get him out in exchange

02:39.627 --> 02:40.694
for the cure.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.730
One of these is an
antiparasitic.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.366
The other two are poisonous.
And only I know which is which.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.835
And as soon as my husband is
free, I will tell you.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.338
Do we have a deal?

02:54.508 --> 02:57.211
We don't have
to keep doing this.

02:57.245 --> 03:02.450
Just tell me
where my father is.

03:04.818 --> 03:08.289
What the hell did he do to make
you hate him so much?

03:16.096 --> 03:17.631
What happened in Somalia?

03:19.267 --> 03:21.101
He told you about that?

03:21.134 --> 03:23.103
He said he couldn't save
your mother

03:23.136 --> 03:25.239
that you blamed him
for her death.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.808
He could have saved her
he chose not to.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.142
He let her die.

03:29.176 --> 03:34.081
He... he watched her die.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.983
I don't believe you.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.286
I was there!

03:39.820 --> 03:41.522
I was there

03:41.555 --> 03:43.757
when the rebels
took the city.

03:43.791 --> 03:49.497
When they lined the civilians up
and told my father

03:49.530 --> 03:53.701
and his soldiers
that they had to choose.

03:53.734 --> 03:58.205
Each soldier could save one
person... just one.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.175
They would have just
executed me on the spot.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.312
But her...

04:04.345 --> 04:09.049
her they... they, uh...
took their time with.

04:09.082 --> 04:13.053
Lucas...

04:13.086 --> 04:15.055
what happened...

04:15.088 --> 04:17.089
was not his fault.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.392
They made him choose.

04:19.427 --> 04:22.530
You can't blame
him for that.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.231
No.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.900
He blamed me.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.672
I could see it in his eyes...

04:31.705 --> 04:33.541
Even at 14...

04:33.574 --> 04:35.709
And every time I
disappointed him,

04:35.743 --> 04:39.513
and every time I didn't live up
to his expectations

04:39.547 --> 04:44.318
of what the great Nathaniel
Taylor's son was supposed to be.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.954
Lucas, you put
this all on yourself.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.189
You, don't patronize me.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.794
Lucas, we located
your father's camp.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.596
An assault team's getting
ready to roll out.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.198
I want to be there.
I figured you would.

04:58.231 --> 05:01.369
They're leaving
from the south gate.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.539
Keep him alive.

05:11.412 --> 05:14.515
Jim! What did they do to you?

05:17.184 --> 05:20.521
The cure! Give it to me.

05:24.592 --> 05:27.395
How long before it
starts killing the parasites?

05:27.428 --> 05:30.130
Parasites? What
parasites? The ones you...

05:30.163 --> 05:31.832
You were bluffing.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.768
You're a highly suggestible
hypochondriac, Mr. Weaver.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.837
I suggest you see
a doctor about that. Josh!

05:36.870 --> 05:39.106
Did you just give me...
A sedative, yeah, I did.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.140
Josh!

05:40.173 --> 05:41.141
Help me get your father out.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.476
We don't have much time.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.150
Come on, girls.
We're getting out of here.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.379
Mom?
Yeah?

05:45.413 --> 05:47.681
That was awesome.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.390
Skye managed to get
a message to Taylor's camp.

05:56.424 --> 05:57.691
They're sending someone for us,

05:57.725 --> 05:59.527
but we have to make it
to the tree line, okay?

05:59.560 --> 06:01.829
With Josh's help,
I think I can make it.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.469
They're looking for us.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.276
Shannon's escaped,
and Weaver's gone missing.

06:32.826 --> 06:33.360
He's alive.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.196
Idiot.
All clear!

06:36.229 --> 06:38.466
They're gone.
No one's here.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.302
Wake this guy up.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.371
Let's find these people.

06:52.279 --> 06:55.015
Wash. You made it.

06:55.048 --> 06:58.318
Dunham was right about
the new perimeter grid.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.320
I disabled it
with this controller.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.089
We got five minutes
until they realize

07:02.122 --> 07:04.468
that this section is down. Where'd
you get your hands on that?

07:04.492 --> 07:07.427
Swiped it off a very drunk
guard at Boylan's.

07:07.461 --> 07:08.638
He's not gonna
stay drunk forever.

07:08.662 --> 07:09.906
Once they trace
that back to you,

07:09.930 --> 07:11.732
they'll know you
helped us escape.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.333
You gotta come with us.

07:13.366 --> 07:15.268
It's 100 yards.

07:15.302 --> 07:17.370
You'll never make it
to the tree line

07:17.404 --> 07:19.473
unless someone
distracts those guards.

07:19.507 --> 07:22.175
Wash... the plan was
for you to come with us.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.811
There's no other way.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.917
Go, and you save your family.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.957
Give Taylor a message
for me, would you?

07:38.726 --> 07:41.662
Remind him about Cu Lao Cham.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.131
Cu Lao Cham? I don't,
I don't know what that is.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.999
He'll understand.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.937
Now...

07:49.970 --> 07:51.672
you get ready to
run like hell.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.407
How will we know when?
You'll know.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.977
Thank you.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.714
Wash...

08:05.085 --> 08:09.189
Tower 6?
Bring the spotlight down here.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.961
Mommy... It's okay,
sweetheart. Just get ready, okay?

08:20.801 --> 08:22.235
Now.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.174
Suspect spotted! Moving east!

08:35.381 --> 08:37.684
Here they come.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.587
Dunham, bring 'em in.
Yes, sir.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.058
Go, go!

09:11.719 --> 09:14.487
You helped the Shannons escape.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.790
Where are they?

09:16.824 --> 09:17.834
Tell me which
way they went,

09:17.858 --> 09:20.160
and I might
let you live.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.779
Load up. We gotta go.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.018
What happened to Wash?

09:46.086 --> 09:49.022
She stayed behind,
so we could get out.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.665
You have three seconds
before I shoot.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.969
Taylor. No.

10:02.002 --> 10:05.038
It's suicide.
You can't.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.341
One...

10:08.375 --> 10:10.343
two...

10:11.912 --> 10:14.715
You know, you have
your father's eyes.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.449
Is it true about Wash,
Commander?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.384
Afraid so.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.054
She was a good soldier.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.122
That she was.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.657
Get these folks settled
they've had a long night.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.598
Is this where we're going to
live now, Daddy?

11:05.632 --> 11:07.067
Just for a little while.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.869
Till the bad people go away,

11:08.902 --> 11:11.671
and then we'll go home
again, okay, sweetie?

11:12.439 --> 11:14.374
Is Mark Reynolds around?

11:14.407 --> 11:15.675
He's on patrol duty.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.211
Okay.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.446
Ah, hell.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.881
Dunham.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.916
Find Reynolds and
take his shift. Me? Why?

11:22.950 --> 11:25.152
Just do it, Private.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.120
Thanks.

11:46.006 --> 11:49.409
Well, you find anything out
there in the Badlands?

11:49.442 --> 11:50.710
We found something.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.145
Wait.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.982
We held up our end
of the bargain.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.084
When are you going
to hold up yours?

11:57.117 --> 11:58.919
Don't worry, you'll be paid.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.454
I'm talking about
going back to 2149.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.056
I want to see my daughter.

12:04.424 --> 12:09.262
As soon as the terminus is repaired,
you and your people are free to go.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.829
Commander Taylor, sir?

12:43.763 --> 12:46.599
Hey. Zoe Shannon.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.368
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.504
Lieutenant Washington
was a nice lady.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.240
She saved us.

12:55.108 --> 12:59.279
She did her duty
right up to the end.

13:07.855 --> 13:09.622
She taught me
how to make a fire.

13:09.656 --> 13:13.060
Well, did she now?

13:13.093 --> 13:15.528
In survival training.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.999
What else did she teach you?

13:19.032 --> 13:21.368
Which way's north.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.303
And which way is it?

13:25.238 --> 13:26.573
That way.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.544
She taught you good.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.934
Thanks.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.239
If you need another hug...

13:59.272 --> 14:00.941
Just ask.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.060
You okay?

14:22.062 --> 14:23.931
Just thinking...
how many more people

14:23.964 --> 14:26.333
are going to die before
this thing is over?

14:27.935 --> 14:30.337
They're bringing
reinforcements.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.407
They're going to bring back
more men and more equipment,

14:34.441 --> 14:37.044
and they're going to keep bringing
them back, whatever it takes.

14:37.077 --> 14:40.747
We can't give up
hope, Jim. Okay?

14:40.780 --> 14:42.349
'Cause that's what
this place is about.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.084
It's about hope
and a second chance,

14:44.117 --> 14:46.419
and we cannot let them
take that away from us.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.956
All right?

14:53.126 --> 14:54.928
I'm going to go
talk to Taylor.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.629
Give him Wash's message.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.331
Okay.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.406
I missed you so much.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.740
Me, too.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.312
Carnotaur.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.415
It's okay. Perimeter's mined.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.051
Besides, you can tell by
the call it's just a juvenile.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.087
Actually, they may be smaller,

15:20.120 --> 15:22.122
but juveniles are
even more vicious.

15:22.155 --> 15:25.092
Kind of like hormonal
teenagers with claws.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.632
Dad...

15:32.665 --> 15:33.733
Don't mind me.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.168
I'm just
passing through.

15:35.202 --> 15:37.170
I got sentry duty.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.938
I-I should get back.

15:42.409 --> 15:46.679
Cu Lao Cham.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.781
Wash told you to remind me

15:48.815 --> 15:51.951
of Cu Lao Cham.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.054
I don't know what it means.

15:54.087 --> 15:58.125
Our unit was pinned down
on the island.

15:58.158 --> 16:01.394
We were outnumbered
two-to-one.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.730
Only way on or off was
a bridge to the mainland.

16:03.763 --> 16:07.267
So we blew the bridge, so they
couldn't bring anymore troops across.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.836
So even though it was
your only way out,

16:09.869 --> 16:11.871
you... you trapped
yourselves there.

16:11.904 --> 16:15.042
Well, we figured two-to-one
was better than three-to-one,

16:15.075 --> 16:17.644
so what the hell,
let's make our stand.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.712
What happened?

16:19.746 --> 16:23.616
I'm still here, aren't I?

16:26.519 --> 16:27.920
The portal.

16:27.954 --> 16:30.590
That's Cu Lao Cham bridge.

16:30.623 --> 16:34.794
As long as it's open, they'll keep
bringing forces back till we're overwhelmed

16:34.827 --> 16:38.865
and then they can start strip-mining,
plundering this place for everything it's worth.

16:38.898 --> 16:43.836
They'll kill this world just as sure as
they killed the world we left behind.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.339
Unless we blow
the bridge.

16:46.373 --> 16:49.442
That's what Wash
was trying to tell us.

16:49.476 --> 16:53.080
Uh, wait now.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.748
Are you talking about
taking out Hope Plaza?

16:59.719 --> 17:01.354
That I am.

17:03.123 --> 17:08.060
Taylor, even if we could
find a way to do it,

17:08.095 --> 17:10.097
we'd be cutting
ourselves off, too.

17:10.130 --> 17:13.233
That means no more meds,
no more technology.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.068
No more colonists.

17:15.102 --> 17:18.271
A thousand people is all
we'd have to restart civilization.

17:18.305 --> 17:21.241
A thousand people...
That is a good round number.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.549
This is our home.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.954
If we have to cut ourselves off
from that future

17:34.987 --> 17:36.523
in order to hold onto our home,

17:36.556 --> 17:39.159
then we'll just have to survive
out here with what we've got.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.961
We'll survive.

17:41.994 --> 17:44.564
But first, let's kick some ass.

17:55.875 --> 18:00.613
Do you have any idea what a kilo
of this stuff is worth in 2149?

18:00.647 --> 18:01.881
And we have

18:01.914 --> 18:03.792
three containers of it just
sitting and gathering dust.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.618
Not for long.

18:05.652 --> 18:08.221
The terminus is fixed?

18:08.255 --> 18:09.689
Malcolm Wallace
just told me.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.591
That ore will be in our
employer's hands

18:11.624 --> 18:12.625
before nightfall.

18:15.228 --> 18:18.231
They are going to be
happy to hear that.

18:18.265 --> 18:21.834
In fact, I might just take
a little trip to 2149.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.736
Present it to them
in person.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.706
Anything to get away from here,
even for a couple hours.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.841
Excuse me, sir.
Yeah?

18:40.153 --> 18:42.088
To what do I owe the pleasure?

18:42.121 --> 18:46.926
Well, I've been thinking a lot
about what you said the other day.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.998
If you're right that
your father's never

18:52.031 --> 18:54.100
going to forgive me
for what I did,

18:54.133 --> 18:57.136
then why bother?

18:57.170 --> 18:59.306
If my loyalty means
nothing to him,

18:59.339 --> 19:03.310
maybe I'm being loyal
to the wrong side.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.282
Why does it have to be you, Jim?

19:09.316 --> 19:11.418
Because I know Hope Plaza
better than anybody.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.853
Besides, I broke into that
place once before, remember?

19:13.886 --> 19:16.389
Yeah, but that was so you
could be with your family.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.124
This could take you away
from us forever.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.893
Elisabeth, you
said it yourself...

19:20.927 --> 19:22.229
If we don't fight them,

19:22.262 --> 19:24.130
then everything we've
sacrificed for,

19:24.163 --> 19:26.899
the life we want for our kids,

19:26.933 --> 19:29.269
will be taken away from us.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.538
I'm not going
to let that happen.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.012
How's it coming?

19:40.046 --> 19:41.681
Good to go.

19:41.714 --> 19:44.251
Let me show you how
to arm this thing. Okay.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.253
This one unlocks
the triggering mechanism,

19:46.286 --> 19:48.721
and this one starts the timer.

19:48.755 --> 19:49.755
Incoming!

19:55.194 --> 19:58.231
It's okay, boys.
It's one of ours.

19:58.265 --> 20:01.634
That is disturbingly
convincing.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.069
We think so.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.805
Reynolds, Dunham, gather up.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.275
Reilly,

20:08.308 --> 20:09.709
you all set?
Yes, sir.

20:09.742 --> 20:10.877
Good.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.745
- Your team... you set?
- Yes, sir.

20:12.779 --> 20:17.083
How about you, Commander?
Wasn't easy, but we got the job done.

20:17.116 --> 20:20.453
We move out in five minutes.

20:23.122 --> 20:25.091
Jim.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.626
Right.
All set here.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.762
Now remember, inject it
as close to the heart

20:29.796 --> 20:32.098
as possible, okay?

20:32.131 --> 20:33.500
You sure it's enough?

20:33.533 --> 20:36.403
This concentration... it
would kill three men instantly.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.274
Listen, I know you're worried.

20:41.308 --> 20:45.077
Tell the kids...
Stop. Jim, don't. Just...

20:45.111 --> 20:49.982
Whatever you're going to say
can wait till you get back, okay?

20:51.518 --> 20:54.153
'Cause you will come
back, won't you, Jim?

20:54.186 --> 20:55.588
Always.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.367
All good? We're
all set to move out.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.602
Whenever you're ready.
Okay.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.307
Three's a crowd.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.643
You heard the lady.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.745
Yes, sir.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.806
What? What is it?

21:48.274 --> 21:49.742
What if I told you

21:49.776 --> 21:52.745
I knew how to get in touch
with your father?

22:02.655 --> 22:04.424
Wait, what are
you talking about?

22:04.457 --> 22:06.859
You're heading back
to the colony? Why?

22:06.893 --> 22:09.496
I got some new information
about my father.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.464
I'm going to follow it up.
Say again.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.265
I'm getting interference
from the terminus.

22:13.299 --> 22:15.535
Something's come up.
I'll explain later.

22:15.568 --> 22:16.945
Okay, what about the cargo
you were bringing?

22:16.969 --> 22:20.239
I'll have someone else
drive it out to you. Lucas out.

22:20.272 --> 22:23.342
So, you really ready to do this?

22:23.376 --> 22:25.244
Lure my father
into an ambush?

22:25.277 --> 22:27.447
Yeah, I'm ready.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.449
All right.

22:31.851 --> 22:35.087
Uh, for the ambush
part anyway.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.743
Good to go.

22:56.776 --> 22:57.644
Good luck.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.579
All right. Get this
thing back to camp.

22:59.612 --> 23:02.014
We need as many vehicles
as we can get.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.083
Will do.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.288
And just how
do you think

23:09.321 --> 23:10.990
you're going to get
this thing started?

23:11.023 --> 23:12.459
You don't know the code.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.698
You know, I'd beat it
out of you, but, uh,

23:18.731 --> 23:21.167
afraid you might like
that, dear brother.

23:22.301 --> 23:25.171
Guess I'll just jack
the starter.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.508
All right, we're ready.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.079
Is that the cargo
from Lucas's truck?

23:33.112 --> 23:34.747
Here it is.

23:34.781 --> 23:37.383
Lucas said to tell
you sorry if he

23:37.416 --> 23:38.885
held you up, but,
uh, there was

23:38.918 --> 23:40.028
something important
he had to do.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.053
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.388
Hooper.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.923
Scan this
into the manifest.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.157
Let's get moving.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.733
Hang on.

23:53.766 --> 23:54.806
Something's not
right here.

23:59.839 --> 24:01.941
Never mind.

24:01.974 --> 24:02.875
We're good.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.186
Let's get this cargo
moving, people.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.879
2149 awaits.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.717
My father's going to destroy
the fracture, isn't he?

25:20.086 --> 25:24.156
He's going to cut this place off
from 2149.

25:28.494 --> 25:30.897
And I was so close
to beating him.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.900
To taking it
all away.

25:33.933 --> 25:35.568
Yeah.

25:35.602 --> 25:39.038
Well, you win some,
you lose some.

25:44.611 --> 25:46.312
And I like to win.

26:00.459 --> 26:02.494
Right this way,
gentlemen.

26:02.528 --> 26:04.831
I'm happy to report
the first shipment

26:04.864 --> 26:06.833
from Terra Nova
has arrived.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.467
We now have a
two-way pipeline

26:08.500 --> 26:10.469
to the most
plentiful world

26:10.502 --> 26:12.438
mankind has
ever known.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.582
Hooper, you there?

26:23.616 --> 26:25.451
This is Hooper.
I'm not reading you.

26:25.484 --> 26:26.686
The interference
is too strong.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.554
Contact... Plaza.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.724
Not copying you. Over.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.592
Hope Plaza is under attack.

26:33.626 --> 26:34.894
They need to power down

26:34.927 --> 26:36.462
and sever their link
to the fracture.

26:36.495 --> 26:37.935
Otherwise,
we could lose it for good.

27:01.553 --> 27:03.389
What did you do?!
What?

27:03.422 --> 27:04.691
What's happening?

27:07.559 --> 27:09.128
The induction coils
are shorted.

27:09.161 --> 27:11.563
Your men must have damaged them
when they moved it.

27:11.597 --> 27:13.432
Can you fix it?

27:14.600 --> 27:17.837
Attaboy, Malcolm.

27:17.870 --> 27:18.805
With the fracture
untethered,

27:18.838 --> 27:20.372
where will Jim
appear when he

27:20.406 --> 27:21.708
returns from Hope Plaza?

27:21.741 --> 27:23.342
Well, he's going to
end up someplace else

27:23.375 --> 27:25.611
when he comes back through,
but don't worry...

27:25.644 --> 27:28.247
It'll be within three
klicks of right here.

27:32.785 --> 27:34.186
I'm going to need
to go back

27:34.220 --> 27:35.888
to the colony
and get replacements.

27:35.922 --> 27:37.156
Well, hurry up, then.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.696
Meteoric iron,

27:43.730 --> 27:45.031
gentlemen.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.799
Back there,
you can't spit

27:46.833 --> 27:48.067
without hitting
the stuff.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.702
We brought back
three containers.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.103
Each one holds

27:51.137 --> 27:53.505
30 metric tons.

27:54.941 --> 27:56.675
Gentlemen,
today you're rich.

27:56.709 --> 27:57.977
Tomorrow...

27:58.010 --> 27:59.912
well, it's just
going to be stupid.

27:59.946 --> 28:01.547
What about
the other matter

28:01.580 --> 28:03.182
we asked you
to look into?

28:03.215 --> 28:04.683
The Badlands.

28:04.717 --> 28:06.685
Yeah, we sent some people
out that way.

28:06.719 --> 28:10.022
And? Did you
find anything?

28:10.056 --> 28:12.458
As a matter of fact, we did.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.374
Why don't you see
for yourselves?

29:14.120 --> 29:15.387
Is it coming
this way?

29:15.421 --> 29:17.323
What do we do?

29:17.356 --> 29:19.191
It's all clear. Go.

29:27.834 --> 29:28.935
Help! Security!

29:28.968 --> 29:32.138
We got a problem...
A big problem!

29:57.663 --> 29:59.498
Move, move!

30:06.138 --> 30:08.540
Commander Taylor, come in.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.242
It's Taylor.
Go ahead, Skye.

30:10.276 --> 30:13.880
It's Lucas, sir... he got away.

30:14.613 --> 30:15.982
Where is he now?

30:16.015 --> 30:18.350
My guess is he's headed
your way,

30:18.384 --> 30:20.286
towards the terminus.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.220
He's on foot.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.421
Copy that.

30:22.454 --> 30:25.024
I'm on it. Out.

30:37.369 --> 30:38.104
Hello, son.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.447
Where you heading
in such a hurry?

30:39.471 --> 30:41.941
I think we both know
the answer to that.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.251
You drew blood.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.320
Didn't think you had it in you.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.023
Think again.

32:03.122 --> 32:06.258
For the first time,
I'm glad your mother is dead.

32:06.292 --> 32:07.693
Don't.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.261
She would be so...

32:09.295 --> 32:11.998
ashamed of what you've become.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.365
Don't say that.

32:13.399 --> 32:14.500
It's true, boy.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.268
You know it's true.

32:18.837 --> 32:22.074
It wasn't my fault she died.

32:22.108 --> 32:23.809
It's not
my fault she...

32:23.842 --> 32:25.511
Your fault she...?

32:25.544 --> 32:27.746
Of course it wasn't.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.682
My God, is that what you think?

32:31.617 --> 32:34.286
Help me...

32:37.223 --> 32:40.326
Just... forgive me.

32:40.359 --> 32:41.893
Please.

32:41.927 --> 32:44.030
It's not that simple.

32:44.063 --> 32:46.898
Look, you've got to answer
for what you've done.

32:46.932 --> 32:48.034
We all do.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.335
Oh, Dad...

32:49.368 --> 32:51.537
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.714
I know.
You're still my son.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.551
You're still my b...

33:19.531 --> 33:21.767
You arrogant fool.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.635
Do you think I care

33:23.669 --> 33:25.971
about your forgiveness?

33:26.004 --> 33:31.643
It's you who should be
begging me for mine!

33:50.796 --> 33:52.231
Oh, God!

33:54.100 --> 33:55.601
Uh, don't move.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.304
It's bad.

33:58.337 --> 34:00.472
Lucas.

34:04.843 --> 34:06.778
I'm sorry.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.463
What the hell did you do?

34:24.496 --> 34:26.931
Weaver...

34:26.965 --> 34:30.034
You stupid
son of a bitch.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.871
Do you have any idea
what you've cost us?!

35:25.090 --> 35:27.493
You think you can
get to your feet?

35:28.727 --> 35:30.629
All right, here.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.373
Oh, my God, he's gone.

35:44.610 --> 35:46.878
Still no sign of him.

35:46.912 --> 35:50.048
A fracture reopened near here.

35:51.016 --> 35:52.784
He's gotta be close.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.222
Oh, come on, Jim.

35:56.255 --> 35:58.790
Elisabeth.

36:11.337 --> 36:14.373
I told you
I'd be back.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.356
What happened?

36:30.389 --> 36:33.725
Hope Plaza...

36:33.759 --> 36:35.193
it's gone.

36:35.227 --> 36:37.062
They blew it to pieces.

36:37.095 --> 36:38.897
What are you talking about?

36:38.930 --> 36:40.566
We're stuck here...

36:42.033 --> 36:43.469
...forever.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.392
Maybe it's just me,

37:06.425 --> 37:07.735
but knowing we're cut off
from the future

37:07.759 --> 37:11.663
makes this jungle seem
a whole lot bigger somehow.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.021
Excuse me, Commander.

37:36.054 --> 37:37.889
Dunham.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.991
Just got a transmission
from the colony.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.027
It's Boylan.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.330
Boylan?

37:46.298 --> 37:48.500
Boylan, this is Taylor.

37:48.534 --> 37:52.504
Hello, Commander.
Good to hear your voice again.

37:52.538 --> 37:54.940
You're taking a hell of a risk,
aren't you?

37:54.973 --> 37:58.076
Contacting me on
an unsecured frequency?

37:58.109 --> 38:00.111
There's no one listening.

38:00.145 --> 38:02.648
In fact, there's no one here.

38:02.681 --> 38:06.117
All those big-spending
new customers of mine?

38:06.151 --> 38:07.218
They're all gone.

38:07.252 --> 38:09.154
What's that, now?

38:09.187 --> 38:10.989
Phoenix picked up
their operation

38:11.022 --> 38:12.099
and rolled out 15 minutes ago.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.393
The whole lot of 'em.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.963
Hey, thanks for the heads up.

38:17.996 --> 38:18.730
We'll be waiting.

38:18.764 --> 38:20.666
Oh, no, not to worry.
They're not

38:20.699 --> 38:22.143
coming your way.
They're headed north.

38:22.167 --> 38:23.234
North?

38:23.268 --> 38:24.770
Don't ask me why.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.639
All I know is I've got an empty
bar that needs filling.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.908
So hurry home, would ya?

39:51.523 --> 39:55.326
It's good to see you up here...
where you belong.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.563
It's good
to be home.

39:57.596 --> 40:01.433
Those bastards left
a lot of scars.

40:01.467 --> 40:04.870
Yeah. Nothing we can't fix.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.938
Shannon, that was
a hell of a thing

40:06.972 --> 40:08.282
you pulled off
back in Hope Plaza.

40:08.306 --> 40:11.409
Makes me kinda glad I didn't
run your ass out the gates

40:11.443 --> 40:13.445
the day you broke
into my colony.

40:14.446 --> 40:15.914
Commander.
Reynolds.

40:15.947 --> 40:17.849
One of our RBs on
the northern perimeter

40:17.883 --> 40:19.618
just spotted the
Phoenix convoy.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.319
A dozen vehicles,
at least a hundred men.

40:21.352 --> 40:22.621
Which way they heading?

40:22.654 --> 40:24.890
We lost track of them
after they passed marker 33.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.058
Looked like they were heading
toward the Badlands.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.527
Badlands?

40:28.560 --> 40:30.428
Why the hell would
they go there?

40:30.462 --> 40:31.697
There's nothing
out there.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.899
Wish I could tell you, sir.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.433
Badlands. Weaver shipped
something

40:35.467 --> 40:37.469
he found out there
back to Hope Plaza.

40:37.503 --> 40:39.104
At least he was going
to, anyway,

40:39.137 --> 40:40.972
if we hadn't switched out
the containers.

40:41.006 --> 40:42.373
I overheard them
talking about it.

40:42.407 --> 40:43.809
Did he say what it was?

40:43.842 --> 40:47.345
Not before he got
a face full of Carno.

40:47.378 --> 40:49.180
Let's track down
that container.

40:59.625 --> 41:02.928
Let's get it out of there,
see what it is.

41:19.811 --> 41:24.082
What is it?
It looks like a statue.

41:30.488 --> 41:34.560
It's not a statue.

41:34.593 --> 41:36.294
It's the prow
of a ship.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.630
It's old.

41:38.664 --> 41:40.932
18th century, from
the looks of it.

41:40.966 --> 41:43.501
How the hell did a ship
from any century

41:43.535 --> 41:45.170
end up in the Badlands?

41:45.203 --> 41:48.073
How did it even end up
in this time period?

41:48.106 --> 41:50.475
Well, it didn't come through
Hope Plaza, that's for sure.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.510
However it got here,

41:52.544 --> 41:54.813
it kinda makes you wonder

41:54.846 --> 41:57.115
what else is out
in the Badlands waiting for us?

41:57.148 --> 42:00.218
What bothers me is why
Phoenix headed out there

42:00.251 --> 42:03.722
the minute they realized
they were cut off from 2149.

42:14.299 --> 42:17.435
Taylor wants to keep this
under wraps until we know more.

42:17.468 --> 42:19.170
And I think that's
the right way to go.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.640
That's fine by me.
To be honest with you,

42:21.673 --> 42:23.408
I don't even want
to think about

42:23.441 --> 42:24.910
what it all
might mean right now.

42:24.943 --> 42:27.412
I'm just really
glad we're safe.

42:27.445 --> 42:29.547
Me, too.
Yeah.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.684
What are they looking at?

42:32.718 --> 42:33.985
Hey, what are you
looking at?

42:34.019 --> 42:38.724
Maddy claims there's
a meteor shower tonight.

42:38.757 --> 42:39.758
Nothing so far, though.

42:39.791 --> 42:42.828
Maybe I got
my calculations wrong.

42:42.861 --> 42:45.731
Zoe, do you want to go inside
and help me run them again?

42:45.764 --> 42:47.032
The kid's been through enough.

42:47.065 --> 42:50.368
Wait. One's coming.
I know it.

42:50.401 --> 42:52.570
Okay...

42:55.406 --> 42:58.509
Told you!

42:58.543 --> 43:00.578
Oh, you called it, Zoe.
